01:05.480 --> 01:07.550
[Mike] No, see, that's what I'm
            saying.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.420
 [Mike] We don't need to drive
              out
   to the middle of nowhere.

01:10.550 --> 01:13.390
[Mike] The big ogre got a job at
              the
     freak show this year.

01:13.820 --> 01:16.120
 [Steve] So you just want to do
              this
         out in public?

01:16.660 --> 01:17.660
   [Steve] I don't know, man.

01:17.660 --> 01:20.360
[Steve] Why don't we just do it
          at his house
       like we always do?

01:20.360 --> 01:22.700
[Bobby] Yeah, I'm with Steve on
           this one.

01:22.700 --> 01:25.670
I mean, I don't think it's worth
 spending a night in jail over.

01:26.300 --> 01:29.270
  No, we're not going to do it
     in the fucking Midway,

01:29.270 --> 01:31.740
  and we're not going to do it
  at his shit-hole of a house.

01:31.740 --> 01:33.440
We've done that too many times.

01:33.740 --> 01:36.410
  This year, it's going to be
       bigger and better.

01:36.410 --> 01:38.310
I've already scoped it all out.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.380
  We're going to wait for him
  back behind their trailers.

01:42.390 --> 01:46.150
When he gets there, we'll rough
            him up,
        strip him down,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.220
 and then let him run down the
             midway

01:48.230 --> 01:51.890
 in his shit-stained underwear
            like the
 freak show faggot that he is.

01:52.860 --> 01:56.530
 Everyone'll get a few laughs,
    he'll run home to mommy,

01:56.530 --> 01:58.500
  and we'll be back to Steve's
         house in time

01:58.500 --> 02:00.900
      to celebrate another
     successful Halloween.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.240
      You guys are unreal.

02:05.140 --> 02:07.810
 Aren't you a little old to be
            fucking
         with that kid?

02:08.550 --> 02:11.180
   I mean, you know he's not
       all there, right?

02:14.320 --> 02:15.180
         [Carol sighs]

02:15.190 --> 02:17.300
 Can't we just go back to your
             place

02:17.300 --> 02:19.420
  and find something a little
     more productive to do?

02:20.920 --> 02:21.420

           [Mike] No.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.790
       This is tradition.

02:24.790 --> 02:28.660
 We've been doing this since we
           were kids
  and we're not stopping now.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.630
         But why, Mike?

02:31.670 --> 02:33.900
       Because, Carol...

02:34.670 --> 02:36.570
   ...it's fun and it's easy.

02:42.410 --> 02:43.910
      I'll be in the car.

02:56.730 --> 02:58.830
You better not pussy out on us,
             Steve.

02:59.230 --> 03:00.830
  Don't worry, man. She'll be
             fine.

03:00.830 --> 03:02.200
 We're not going to miss this.

03:03.970 --> 03:05.300
           You cool?

03:05.900 --> 03:07.640
          Yeah, sure.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.940
Okay, let's get the fuck out of
             here.

03:11.780 --> 03:13.510
  I'll catch up with you guys
             later.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.680
  [Gus] Well, that's what I'm
             trying
          to tell you!

03:20.680 --> 03:22.450
 Why don't you call your sister

03:22.450 --> 03:24.790
   and the three of us can do
      this thing together?

03:24.790 --> 03:27.260
  I'm out of here in an hour,
       I can pick her up.

03:27.420 --> 03:28.620
   [indistinct radio sounds]

03:28.860 --> 03:30.860
  Oh, you're killing me, man!

03:31.530 --> 03:32.730
         Alright, then.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.330
          Let me know.

03:34.330 --> 03:35.360
   You know where to find me.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.300
       Well, lookey here.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.310
     You fellas off to find
     some trouble or what?

03:44.310 --> 03:46.610
  Oh, just the usual Halloween
            hazing.

03:48.810 --> 03:51.650
Oh, now that's what I'm talking
             about.

03:51.650 --> 03:53.350
       Details, details.

03:53.350 --> 03:54.580
    [Mike] I don't think so.

03:54.580 --> 03:56.650
 We just need to get that stuff
          you owe us.

03:57.350 --> 03:59.620
   Ah, come on, let me in on
      some of this action.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.490

             Okay.

04:05.900 --> 04:09.960
 Okay, well, how about I don't
              have
       "the stuff", pal?

04:09.970 --> 04:11.670
 Did you ever think about that?

04:12.270 --> 04:14.370
    Fuck off, man, come on.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.570
  Look, guys, I don't ask for
           anything.

04:18.579 --> 04:19.670

04:20.279 --> 04:21.740

          disgusting.

  I can't believe these freaks
  actually pay for this stuff.

      gives me the creeps.

 Steve, do we really need to do
             this?

09:09.100 --> 09:10.700
 I have a bad feeling about it.

     as high this weekend,

      on the road with us,

           together!

Now, you know I wouldn't put you
        in any situation

10:14.030 --> 10:16.030
I wouldn't put myself in, right?

10:17.630 --> 10:19.000
     You are one of us now.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.460
  you wouldn't happen to know
         where I could
find a little action, would you?

 Hey, big guy, Happy Halloween.

      a head start on us.

    ¶ Give me that old time
          religion. ¶

19:45.630 --> 19:48.240
  ¶ It's good enough for me. ¶

19:48.670 --> 19:51.440
       [Marcy over radio]
 Dispatch to Sheriff Bramford.

19:56.410 --> 19:59.400
     Yeah, Marcy, go ahead.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.380
  [Marcy over radio] Sam, Mrs.
            Hoffstat
  called twice since you left.

20:02.620 --> 20:05.920
Copy that, dispatch, I'm driving
              down
   lovely Ms. Hoffstat's road

20:05.920 --> 20:09.320
 as we speak, and I do not see
 a single case of lewd conduct.

20:09.330 --> 20:10.790
           Not a one.

20:10.790 --> 20:12.260
[Marcy over radio] We certainly
    appreciate your bravery,

20:12.260 --> 20:14.760
 -big, strong Sheriff Bramford.
       -[Bramford laughs]

20:15.600 --> 20:17.800
You know what, Marcy, I like it
when you get jealous like this,

20:17.800 --> 20:20.530
 -but let's face it, there's--
   -[thumping, ominous music]

20:28.810 --> 20:30.610
    [Marcy over radio] Sam?

20:39.360 --> 20:41.560
  I just saw your sneaky ass.

20:42.290 --> 20:43.690
       Now show yourself.

20:54.400 --> 20:57.400
       [Marcy over radio]
       Sam, do you copy?

20:57.670 --> 20:59.310
   Yeah, I'm here, go ahead.

20:59.310 --> 21:03.640
 [Marcy over radio] Thank God.
 You know I hate it when you do
             that.

21:04.310 --> 21:06.350
 I'm sorry, Marcy, everything's
             fine.

21:06.350 --> 21:09.020
   [Marcy over radio] Well, I
            wouldn't
  get ahead of yourself there,
              Sam.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.350
       [Marcy over radio]
You need to get down here right
             away.

21:11.350 --> 21:13.020
       [Marcy over radio]
      We have a situation.

21:13.390 --> 21:15.320
        Okay, on my way.

21:51.760 --> 21:53.030
   [Marcy] Sheriff Bramford,

21:53.030 --> 21:57.860
 Miss Sapirstein has something
 she would like to talk to you
             about.

21:59.070 --> 22:01.970
   Hey, Carol. What's wrong?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.570
          Is it Mike?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.380
    [Marcy] Go ahead, honey.

22:10.050 --> 22:12.050
   Tell him what you told me.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.920
    No. I mean, not really.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.690
  Look, I don't know what I'm
          doing here,

22:22.690 --> 22:25.030
 I just didn't know who else to
              go,
  and my dad's out of town...

22:25.860 --> 22:28.900
  It's fine. Just breathe, and
            tell me
        what's going on.

22:33.900 --> 22:36.570
A few of us went to the carnival
          last night.

22:37.540 --> 22:39.770
  They didn't mean for things
        to get so crazy.

22:39.780 --> 22:41.880
 They were just messing around.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.840
    -[high-pitched ringing]
       -[punches landing]

22:44.780 --> 22:46.110
     Did someone get hurt?

22:47.020 --> 22:48.010
              Yes.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.450
    That kid, Jacob Atkins.

22:52.590 --> 22:55.490
  They play some stupid prank
       on him every year,

22:55.490 --> 22:59.160
  and, last night, he hit Mike
   and they all attacked him.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.030
   [Carol] I should have told
        someone sooner.

23:02.030 --> 23:03.160
[Carol] I just didn't know what
             to do.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.070
   [Carol] I was just scared.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.900
        [Carol sobbing]

23:09.740 --> 23:12.740
[Carol] And then Bobby called me
       last night, and...

23:13.080 --> 23:15.110
        [Carol sobbing]

23:15.510 --> 23:17.140
    [Bramford] That's fine.
      What did Bobby say?

23:18.180 --> 23:21.680
   [Carol] He said he thinks
  they might have killed him.

23:26.190 --> 23:30.590
Well, first off, nobody reported
      anything about this.

23:31.030 --> 23:32.930
     And I can assure you,
I'd be the first person to know

23:32.930 --> 23:34.590
 if there was a murder in town.

23:34.600 --> 23:35.700
          That's true.

23:35.700 --> 23:39.170
    Now, what the boys did,
       on the other hand,

23:39.500 --> 23:41.020
that was completely out of line.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.540
I'll be having a talk with Mike
          right away.

23:42.540 --> 23:43.970
    No, you can't tell them
          I was here.

23:43.970 --> 23:45.870
       This is so stupid.
          I should go.

23:45.870 --> 23:47.870
   Hey, I won't tell anybody
         you were here.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.480
        Now, get on home
       and get some rest.

23:52.050 --> 23:54.820
 [radio playing in background]

24:00.120 --> 24:02.090
Guess I'm going to the carnival.

24:02.090 --> 24:03.520
        Well, have fun.

24:03.530 --> 24:04.520
     [Bramford] Yeah, yeah.

24:10.070 --> 24:11.600
           [knocking]

24:21.010 --> 24:23.040
       Good morning, Sir,
   I'm Sheriff Sam Bramford,

24:23.050 --> 24:24.510
 Grove Hill Police Department.

24:24.510 --> 24:25.510
     Do you have a minute?

24:26.080 --> 24:27.880
        No, not really.

24:29.020 --> 24:30.750
 Well, I'd like to talk to you
       about an incident

24:30.750 --> 24:31.990
 that happened here last night.

24:31.990 --> 24:36.120
   Oh, you mean, my employee
 getting his brains kicked in.

24:37.060 --> 24:37.960
           Employee?

24:38.690 --> 24:39.960
      Jacob works for you?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.900
       Look, Sam, was it?

24:43.700 --> 24:46.130
  As much as I appreciate you
        coming down here

24:46.130 --> 24:48.770
     to deliver justice to
      your local hoodrats,

24:48.770 --> 24:50.000
     you're a little late.

24:50.010 --> 24:55.080
    Jacob took one hell of a
            beating,
      but he's just fine.

24:58.010 --> 24:59.110
             I see.

25:01.520 --> 25:02.980
  Okay, well, thanks for your
             time.

25:03.990 --> 25:06.220
 [Dr. Death] God, that's what I
              love
        about you guys.

25:07.990 --> 25:10.120
   You see, I take this show
     all over the country,

25:10.130 --> 25:13.030
 and over the years, I learned
     two things about cops:

25:13.760 --> 25:15.800
   they never prevent the bad
             things
        from happening,

25:15.800 --> 25:18.670
       they just show up
    after the crime's done,

25:18.830 --> 25:21.740
   like glorified garbage men
         with a badge.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.310
        Is that a fact?

25:28.310 --> 25:29.840
  And what's the second thing?

25:31.180 --> 25:33.280
  I don't fucking trust any of
             them.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.890
    Ya'all have a nice day.

25:49.930 --> 25:51.670
        What did you do?

25:57.770 --> 25:58.940
      [trailer door slams]

26:21.900 --> 26:23.230
        Sam to dispatch.

26:23.230 --> 26:26.070
       [Marcy over radio]
      Dispatch, go ahead.

26:26.070 --> 26:28.800
 Yeah, Marcy, I'm just leaving
      the fairgrounds now.

26:28.800 --> 26:31.140
 I just talked to the guy that
              runs
    the carnival down here,

26:31.140 --> 26:33.640
     and he confirmed Miss
       Sapirstein's story
         about the boys

26:33.640 --> 26:35.010
  pounding on that Jacob kid.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.740
    But he also informed me
    Jacob's alive and well,

26:37.750 --> 26:39.210
    just beat up pretty bad.

26:39.780 --> 26:40.810
        And, get this...

26:40.820 --> 26:43.530
 ...apparently, he's got Jacob
        working for him.

26:43.530 --> 26:46.250
   [Marcy over radio] Really?
   That seems a little weird.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.750
      My thoughts exactly.

26:48.660 --> 26:50.100
 So I'm going to head on over,

26:50.100 --> 26:51.550
  and I'm going to pay Jacob a
             visit,

26:51.550 --> 26:52.990
  see if I can't get his side
         of the story.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.630
  Something doesn't feel right
       about any of this.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.360
       [Marcy over radio]
        Copy that, Sam.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.000
     It's Sheriff Bramford.

28:13.280 --> 28:15.010
   Hey, Jacob, are you home?

28:15.010 --> 28:16.740
  I just want to speak to you
      for a minute, buddy.

28:18.780 --> 28:19.710
             Hello?

             Hello?

29:46.400 --> 29:48.330
  [distorted voice over phone]
      I know what you did.

        [Steve laughing]

30:14.900 --> 30:16.130
       You're a dumbass.

30:16.130 --> 30:17.930
   You almost gave me a heart
            attack.

30:18.100 --> 30:21.130
What, I was just trying to scare
              you
  out of those little shorts.

30:21.300 --> 30:24.300
    Fat chance of that ever
           happening
if you pull something like that
             again.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.080
I was just having a little fun.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.610
What are you so wound up about?

30:32.610 --> 30:35.010
    Wound up? Why am I so--

30:36.150 --> 30:38.850
 Do you remember what I watched
       you do last night?

30:39.320 --> 30:42.420
 Look, Carol, I'm sorry, okay?

30:42.860 --> 30:44.440
       But Jacob's fine.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.030
      Mike's dad went down
  and checked it out himself.

30:47.030 --> 30:48.060
       What do you mean?

30:48.630 --> 30:50.130
    Did they call the cops?

30:50.400 --> 30:52.900
 I don't know. Look, I'm sorry.

30:53.030 --> 30:54.470
Just come over here and kiss me.

30:56.340 --> 30:59.110
    Well, don't do anything
        like that again.

30:59.510 --> 31:00.340
            I won't.

31:07.150 --> 31:09.380
     You're so goddamn cute
      when you're scared.

31:10.090 --> 31:11.280
         [both chuckle]

31:11.990 --> 31:13.390
  I'll pick you up after work.

       [Mike] Hey, Carol.

32:40.210 --> 32:43.180
      Mike, you scared me.

32:43.180 --> 32:45.710
    You know I really didn't
           appreciate
     the way you treated me

32:45.710 --> 32:47.010
     on the phone earlier.

32:47.650 --> 32:50.250
         That was you?
          Very funny.

32:50.490 --> 32:53.390
 You know, I actually wanted to
            tell you
   I had an interesting talk

32:53.390 --> 32:54.650
   with my dad this morning.

32:56.260 --> 32:57.190
             Okay.

32:57.530 --> 32:59.540
        Come on, Carol.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.560
    I know you ratted us out
 for what happened last night.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.200
            But why?

33:03.470 --> 33:05.430
 I thought you were cooler than
             that.

33:06.370 --> 33:08.470
    I don't know what you're
      talking about, Mike.

33:09.100 --> 33:10.070
       But I have to go.

      What are you doing?

33:14.310 --> 33:15.270
            Look...

33:15.280 --> 33:20.010
   I know you ran your mouth
            because
 you're a scared, little bitch,

33:20.020 --> 33:23.220
  and you care about that big,
 retarded fuck for some reason.

33:23.450 --> 33:25.550
But the idiot is alive and well,

33:25.550 --> 33:28.490
 which means no one had to say
         a damn thing.

33:29.290 --> 33:31.360
  So why don't you do us all a
             favor

33:31.590 --> 33:34.460
and just keep your fucking mouth
              shut
          from now on?

33:34.460 --> 33:35.460
             Okay?

33:40.370 --> 33:41.600
  [Chet] Can I help you, man?

         [door chimes]

33:48.080 --> 33:49.240
       [Gus] Hey, buddy.

33:51.410 --> 33:53.150
   Hey, you're late, asshole.

33:56.050 --> 33:57.650
        Yeah, look, man.

33:58.420 --> 34:02.190

 had a really wild night, okay?

       even dream about.

           Oh, yeah?

       Tell me about it.

34:11.070 --> 34:13.070
 Let me put it to you this way:

 there was a lot of asses last
             night.

34:16.100 --> 34:20.210
    Some of them got kicked,
 and some of them got sticked.

 [Radio DJ] Hello, Grove Hill,
  this is your favorite radio

34:41.360 --> 34:45.429
And I am coming to you live from
              the
spooktacular Halloween carnival

34:45.429 --> 34:48.429
 at the Grove Hill fairgrounds.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.570
Now, people, this place needs to
            be seen
        to be believed.

34:52.570 --> 34:55.840
They've got freaks, they've got
            treats,
        they've got fun,

34:55.840 --> 34:58.110
they've got games for everyone.

34:58.110 --> 35:00.680
So bring your sister, bring your
            mother,
        bring your dog,

35:00.680 --> 35:05.380
 but you better hurry, because
              this
   freak show is packing up,

35:05.550 --> 35:07.650

             night.

     Don't worry about it.

   I'm going to talk to him,
   and it won't happen again.

 Well, he's a prick and I hate
              him.

  It's quite literally a shock
         to all of us.

   to the bottom of it, son.

        to the station,

40:58.110 --> 40:59.840

       whoever did this.

    Can you do that for me?

Conrad, I need you to take Chet
 down to the station and file a

41:50.830 --> 41:52.660
Probably not going to say much,

41:52.660 --> 41:53.730
 but I want you to get anything
      you can out of him.

41:53.730 --> 41:54.790
           Yes, sir.
 but I want you to get anything
      you can out of him.

42:06.540 --> 42:07.620
           Yes, sir.

42:07.620 --> 42:08.710
       Sheriff Bramford,
        what's going on?

42:08.710 --> 42:09.810
    What are you doing here?

42:10.010 --> 42:11.280
    We heard Gus was killed.

42:17.550 --> 42:21.750
   If you two know something,
 you need to tell me right now.

42:28.830 --> 42:32.300
        [clock ticking]

42:32.970 --> 42:36.170
[Bramford] So Gus drives you out
             there,
  turns up dead the next day.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.770
I can see why you guys would be
          freaked out,

42:39.970 --> 42:42.680
      but I'm telling you,
     there's no connection.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.280
  Look, Gus was a bit of a bad
             apple.

42:46.280 --> 42:48.280
   We don't know the kinds of
             things
          he was into.

42:49.750 --> 42:53.820
So, what, you just want us to go
  about our lives like nothing
           happened?

42:54.360 --> 42:56.790
   Like it's just some weird
          coincidence?

42:57.590 --> 42:59.120
  I want you to stop worrying,

42:59.130 --> 43:00.990
    because there's nothing
        to worry about.

43:07.270 --> 43:09.030
        Come on, Carol.

43:12.140 --> 43:14.270
    I'll walk you guys out.

43:20.310 --> 43:22.310
           [exhales]

43:22.320 --> 43:24.780
  See, this is why you need to
          carry a gun.

43:25.020 --> 43:26.250
  I don't know why you don't.

43:26.250 --> 43:29.150
 Because things like this don't
             happen
          in our town.

43:32.890 --> 43:34.090
         It's a fluke.

43:37.400 --> 43:41.070
 All right, Fox, you and I will
             go to
 the carnival and check things
              out.

43:41.240 --> 43:43.100
   Conrad, you're on patrol.

43:43.100 --> 43:44.970
  You'll know where we'll be
    if we find out anything
          interesting.

43:46.240 --> 43:47.240
             Okay?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.810
       Okay, let's roll.

44:06.260 --> 44:09.030
 So what kinds of things do you
             think
  that Gus character was into

44:09.030 --> 44:11.100
that would warrant that kind of
           execution?

44:11.900 --> 44:13.830
 Who knows, Fox? Could be any,
           old thing.

44:13.830 --> 44:15.370
   If I had to guess, I'd say
             drugs.

44:16.070 --> 44:17.940
    I just can't believe it.

44:17.940 --> 44:19.970
  I haven't seen anything like
              this
       in my entire life.

44:19.970 --> 44:21.740
 I mean, the time it would take
  to do something like that--

44:21.740 --> 44:22.980
        -Fox, Fox, Fox!
       -Who would even--

44:23.310 --> 44:24.310
         I don't know.

44:27.310 --> 44:29.750
          [car starts]

44:34.460 --> 44:35.920
       [Bobby] Holy shit.

44:35.920 --> 44:38.420
   [Bobby] And Mike's dad is
            certain
      it had nothing to do

44:38.430 --> 44:40.060
 with what happened last night?

44:41.300 --> 44:43.360
 Seemed pretty confident about
              it.

44:46.130 --> 44:47.400
           [knocking]

44:57.910 --> 44:59.340
  So what's the big emergency?

44:59.350 --> 45:01.480
   Gus was murdered, asshole.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.720
      Yeah, I know, Carol.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.750
My dad's the sheriff, remember?

45:06.190 --> 45:07.920
 So what's that got to do with
              me?

45:08.290 --> 45:10.960
 Look, man, we're just kind of
          freaked out.

45:11.130 --> 45:12.960
  Don't you think it's sort of
             weird?

45:12.960 --> 45:15.030
 No, Bobby, I don't think it's
             weird.

45:15.030 --> 45:17.930
 People are saying he had candy
              corn
    shoved down his throat.

45:18.230 --> 45:20.500
      Isn't that a little
         coincidental?

45:20.840 --> 45:22.300
    [whispers] Jesus Christ.

45:22.300 --> 45:23.770
 I think we should consider the
          fact that...

45:23.900 --> 45:26.140
 maybe this isn't a coincidence
            at all.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.010
  [Carol] Maybe it's something
             more.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.210
     Oh, really? Like what?

45:31.510 --> 45:34.750
 Like Jacob killed Gus and he's
             coming
         for all of us?

45:35.120 --> 45:36.850
The guy can't even spell his own
             name,

45:36.850 --> 45:39.020
 and you think he's the fucking
         Zodiac killer?

45:39.190 --> 45:41.750
 Look, man, maybe she's right,
      maybe you're right.

45:41.760 --> 45:44.270
         We don't know.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.790
   But it's not going to hurt
            anything
if we're just a little bit more
            careful

45:54.100 --> 45:55.830
 And what do you think, Bobby?

45:57.370 --> 45:59.140
   I don't know, man, maybe--

45:59.140 --> 46:00.470
 That's right, you don't know.

46:00.470 --> 46:01.940
        None of you do.

46:04.010 --> 46:07.550
So my suggestion is you all take
     a fucking chill pill,

46:07.550 --> 46:08.980
      and forget about it.

46:09.220 --> 46:11.880
   Fuck Gus, and fuck Jacob.

46:17.830 --> 46:18.990
         [door closing]

46:20.900 --> 46:22.130
       Maybe he's right.

46:23.060 --> 46:24.430
      Maybe it's nothing.

46:25.330 --> 46:27.970
          Yeah, maybe.

46:29.970 --> 46:31.570
       Come on, let's go.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.810
    Hey, it'll be all right.

46:40.820 --> 46:41.880
         [door closing]

46:50.420 --> 46:51.920
        [glass clinking]

46:58.200 --> 46:59.200
             Steve?

46:59.530 --> 47:02.030
       [ominous rumbling]

47:07.210 --> 47:08.440
             Mike?

47:09.040 --> 47:11.380
I swear to God, man, if you're--

47:11.380 --> 47:13.550
        [thumping music]

47:14.380 --> 47:16.450
       [Bobby struggling]

47:18.920 --> 47:20.190
         [Bobby groans]

47:21.920 --> 47:24.490
        [flesh ripping]

47:33.030 --> 47:36.540
       [blood squirting]

47:39.070 --> 47:41.910
       [Jacob breathing]

47:48.250 --> 47:50.350
      [blood splattering]

47:55.920 --> 47:58.990
        [carnival music]

47:58.990 --> 48:02.190
     [Dr. Death whistling]

48:03.330 --> 48:04.660
     Well, look who it is!

48:05.000 --> 48:06.430
 [Dr. Death] My old, pal, Sam.

48:06.430 --> 48:07.500
         What a treat!

48:08.040 --> 48:09.640
 And look! He brought a friend.

48:09.640 --> 48:11.440
   [Dr. Death] What can I do
        for you fellas?

48:11.970 --> 48:13.140
         -We need to--
    -[Dr. Death] No, wait--

48:13.470 --> 48:15.040
         Shrunken head.

48:17.180 --> 48:19.080
 No, no, no, no, that's not it,
             is it?

48:19.080 --> 48:22.480
 Wait, how about a candlestick
              made
     from a hangman's fat?

48:22.620 --> 48:24.150
  Where'd I put that, anyway?

48:24.350 --> 48:26.320
    -We need to speak with--
   -[Dr. Death] No, wa-- Shh.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.450
   Why didn't I think of this
            earlier?

48:28.460 --> 48:30.390
  There's no doubt in my mind
       you two gentlemen

48:30.390 --> 48:32.590
     came for one of these.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.960
   You know, they're normally
      six dollars a piece.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.660
but I want you each to have one

48:38.300 --> 48:40.930
   as a personal thank you.
         A gift from me

48:40.940 --> 48:43.640
 for being so welcomed to your
      vibrant little town.

48:48.440 --> 48:49.480
         Here, take it.

48:49.480 --> 48:50.510
   We need to speak with you
       somewhere private.

48:53.280 --> 48:55.280
     Anything for you, Sam.

49:05.290 --> 49:07.490
  So you think I had something
        to do with this?

49:07.700 --> 49:09.230
Is that what you're getting at?

49:09.960 --> 49:12.460
 I'm not saying that. Not yet.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.270
    We're just trying to get
  all the information we can.

49:16.270 --> 49:17.600
  I'm sure you can understand
             that.

49:18.210 --> 49:20.410
     No. I can't, actually.

49:22.110 --> 49:24.410
   Where is Jacob right now?
    I'd like to talk to him.

49:24.580 --> 49:27.480
  I told you, I sent him home
       to get some rest.

49:27.680 --> 49:30.520
 After the gang bang your boys
        pulled on him...

49:31.620 --> 49:33.320
It's funny you should say that.

49:33.320 --> 49:35.520
   I drove out to his place
after I left here this morning.

49:35.720 --> 49:36.760
         Wasn't there.

49:36.760 --> 49:40.690
   Well, I wouldn't get your
            panties
      all in a bunch, Sam.

49:41.060 --> 49:44.300
I'm sure you've been turned down
  by better looking guys than
             Jacob.

49:44.300 --> 49:45.660
I've about had it with your lip!

49:45.670 --> 49:46.700
           [knocking]

49:55.010 --> 49:56.240
    Is the sheriff in there?

50:05.350 --> 50:06.690
      What is it, Conrad?

50:06.690 --> 50:09.320
 Sheriff, there's been another
            murder.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.130
       Don't look at me.

50:15.400 --> 50:18.560
I've got a rock-solid alibi this
             time.

50:27.270 --> 50:30.040
      [slow, piano music]

51:02.110 --> 51:03.710
         This is the--

51:05.350 --> 51:07.480
   This is the same exact...

51:07.480 --> 51:09.650
   Fox, go call the coroner.

51:18.090 --> 51:20.630
       [music continues]

51:38.380 --> 51:40.280
 How'd you find out about this?

51:40.750 --> 51:44.350
 The neighbors were out walking
           their dog
       and heard screams.

51:45.420 --> 51:47.120
    They know what happened?

51:47.820 --> 51:49.860
 Good, let's keep it that way.

51:51.760 --> 51:54.860
  Meet me back at the station.
   We've got some work to do.

52:03.640 --> 52:07.270
    Oh, Sam, there you are.

52:07.470 --> 52:09.270
      Is everything okay?

52:09.280 --> 52:10.540
      No, Marcy, it's not.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.380
  There's been another murder.

52:13.580 --> 52:16.210
 Bobby, one of Mike's friends.

52:20.650 --> 52:23.160
    Think I was wrong about
        who killed Gus.

52:23.860 --> 52:26.930
I need you to contact the local
              news
  and tell them to put out an
         announcement.

52:26.930 --> 52:28.630
 No one's to be out after dark.

52:31.700 --> 52:33.300
          Okay, um...

52:33.430 --> 52:35.500
  Anyone caught on the street
    after the sun goes down

52:35.500 --> 52:37.700
  will be arrested on the spot
        and put in jail.

52:41.480 --> 52:42.470
            Conrad.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.470
  I want you posted up on 71.

52:43.480 --> 52:47.280
 No one under any circumstances
  enters or leaves this town.

52:49.680 --> 52:52.620
Fox, you stay here and you help
             Marcy.
         I'll be back.

52:52.790 --> 52:53.690
           Yes, sir.

52:58.590 --> 53:00.360
 Everything's going to be okay.

53:01.630 --> 53:03.330
     It's going to be okay.

53:06.830 --> 53:09.570
  [man on TV] Oh, hello, I was
           just doing
         an experiment.

53:11.310 --> 53:12.020
[man on TV] I left the receiver
              on.

53:12.020 --> 53:12.740
         [woman on TV]
  That's what I thought, but I
            kept...

53:12.740 --> 53:15.410
     Mike, we need to talk.

53:15.410 --> 53:17.410
 [woman on TV] ...the maid had
          been bitten
           by a bat,

53:17.410 --> 53:19.380
 [woman on TV] and she's afraid
       it might be rabid.

53:19.380 --> 53:22.810
[man on TV] What? Oh, all right.
  Tell her I'll be right over
             there.

53:24.550 --> 53:27.220
  Look, son, I need you to be
     crystal clear with me.

53:27.550 --> 53:29.490
  What the hell happened last
             night?

53:29.620 --> 53:32.560
 Jesus Christ, we've been over
             this.

53:32.730 --> 53:34.260
        You listen here.

53:34.630 --> 53:37.010
  I've about had it with you!

53:37.010 --> 53:39.400
 [Bramford] You're getting too
          goddamn old
to be pulling this kind of shit.

53:39.400 --> 53:41.330
     And this time I think
       you went too far.

53:41.340 --> 53:43.240
     What the hell is that
       supposed to mean?

53:43.400 --> 53:45.270
 It means I'm starting to think
     that those characters

53:45.270 --> 53:47.270
      down at the carnival
      are behind all this.

53:47.270 --> 53:48.840
      Behind all of what?

53:51.010 --> 53:52.640
  Behind what happened to Gus.

53:53.550 --> 53:55.210
        This is insane.

53:55.210 --> 53:56.880
Look, I can't explain everything
       to you right now.

53:56.880 --> 53:58.880
 I just need you to trust me on
             this.

53:59.820 --> 54:02.320
    I need you to stay put,
        lock the doors,

54:02.320 --> 54:04.720
don't even think about going out
       until I get back.

54:05.260 --> 54:07.490
We're putting the town on curfew
     until i can figure out

54:07.490 --> 54:08.530
   what the hell is going on.

54:08.530 --> 54:09.830
         [Mike laughs]

54:09.830 --> 54:13.670
If you talk to your friends, you
           tell them
the same thing I'm telling you.

54:20.510 --> 54:22.040
     Call Marcy if you need
        anything at all.

54:22.040 --> 54:23.980
   She'll patch you straight
         through to me.

54:30.920 --> 54:31.880
         [door closes]

54:35.520 --> 54:36.640
   [man on TV] Andy, we're in
            trouble.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.760
[man on TV] Wendel Hines came in
     to pick up $350,000...

54:37.760 --> 54:39.890
           [kissing]

54:41.330 --> 54:42.860
        [phone ringing]

54:43.030 --> 54:44.400
       [heavy breathing]

54:44.870 --> 54:45.960
       Don't answer that.

54:46.300 --> 54:47.670
      -I'll be right back.
        -[Carol laughs]

54:52.870 --> 54:53.840
             Hello?

54:55.510 --> 54:57.510
      Hey, man, what's up,
       I'm a little busy.

55:01.550 --> 55:02.950
      So what's that mean?

55:07.750 --> 55:10.460
  All right, it's still early,
maybe the curfew will be lifted,

55:10.460 --> 55:12.560
and then we can have the party.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.660
     [music playing on TV]

55:17.500 --> 55:19.830
 All right, man, well, call me
      if anything changes.

55:21.100 --> 55:24.600
     Sorry, that was Mike.
          Party's off.

55:27.010 --> 55:29.370

56:32.640 --> 56:34.870
 [Marcy] Yes, I understand Mrs.
            Waldorf,

56:34.880 --> 56:37.480
 but that's all the information
       I have right now.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.120
  -[Bramford] Everything good?
           -Yes, sir.

56:39.120 --> 56:40.770
 [Marcy] Just stay put and wait
    for the Sheriff's word.

56:40.770 --> 56:42.410
Marcy, I know you're swimming in
               it
 right now, but just keep with
              it.

56:42.420 --> 56:43.420
 [Bramford] We'll be back soon.

56:43.420 --> 56:45.030
   -[Fox] Where are we going?
       -[phones ringing]

56:45.030 --> 56:46.650
 We're going to Jacob's house.

        [phone ringing]

56:59.250 --> 57:01.600
 [man on TV] You forget that I
            had you
 in charge when you were a very
           sick man.

57:02.140 --> 57:04.170
 [man on TV] When you raved in
           delirium.

57:05.210 --> 57:08.110
[man on TV] And I heard you talk
      about a hidden room.

57:08.110 --> 57:09.870
  [man on TV] Now, where else
         could you put
         a hidden room,

57:09.880 --> 57:11.940
   [man on TV] except in that
            mansion
           you built?

     [Fox] Sheriff, I think
       I found something!

         [Fox coughing]

59:44.360 --> 59:45.730
          What is it?

59:45.900 --> 59:47.230
   [Fox] It's under the bed.

59:50.740 --> 59:51.670

        [thumping bass]

01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.950
 [crunching, squishing sounds]

01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:57.950
      [tooth breaking out]

01:17:59.090 --> 01:18:00.860
        [Mike screaming]

01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:03.960
 [crunching, squishing sounds]

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.270
   [Mike continues screaming]

01:18:16.880 --> 01:18:18.940
         [music fades]

01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:24.010
        [carnival music]

01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:29.090
     So, what, you're like
     a summoner of spirits?

01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:30.220
      Something like that.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.820
And these are real human teeth?

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:36.260
     As real as real gets.

01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:40.230
         So that's it?

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:43.970
    You just pried out some
        asshole's teeth,

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.240
  and made a necklace of them?

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.000
       That's your thing?

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:48.040
      Oh, no, no, no, no,

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.740
   it's much more than that.

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.880
 You see, everything in my shop
              here
          has a story,

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.480
       similar to the one
       that necklace has.

01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.920
  I've been doing this a long
             time,

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:04.090
and this cruel world doesn't get
   any nicer as time goes on.

01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:08.020
   So as long as those freaks
         are out there,

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.360
  holding people like us down,

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.060
     I'll be right here...

01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:15.500
    ...keeping the balance.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.540
        [ominous music]

01:19:36.190 --> 01:19:37.850
     [candy corn rattling]

01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:40.020
           [chewing]
