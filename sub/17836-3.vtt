00:01.002 --> 00:02.334
Previously on <i> Teen Wolf...</i>

00:02.336 --> 00:04.203
It's just a straight-forward
robbery-homicide.

00:04.205 --> 00:07.306
He was bludgeoned to death and
stuffed in a high school air duct.

00:07.308 --> 00:08.741
The ghost riders, the wild hunt.

00:08.743 --> 00:11.210
I've never heard of it doing
anything to anyone's memory.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.878
What the hell is a Stiles?

00:12.880 --> 00:15.881
I know that someone chained me up and
I think they wanted me to stay human.

00:15.883 --> 00:17.316
What if we're all missing
the same person?

00:17.318 --> 00:18.951
He was sitting right there.

00:18.953 --> 00:20.753
I think I loved him.

00:23.357 --> 00:28.127
Power. The ability
to control things.

00:29.196 --> 00:32.296
This metal has no power.

00:32.299 --> 00:36.402
It's small, weak, insignificant.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.704
Is there anything we can
do to change that?

00:41.142 --> 00:42.574
Corey, what you got?

00:43.778 --> 00:45.344
We can add electricity.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.279
Exactly.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.817
We turn this metal rod...

00:53.154 --> 00:54.420
into a magnet.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.089
Now it has power.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.791
Now it has influence...

01:01.462 --> 01:02.528
over others.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.668
Are, are you okay,
Mr. Douglas?

01:46.140 --> 01:47.539
Just a little cough.

01:51.178 --> 01:53.145
Where were we? Um...

01:55.749 --> 01:58.250
Right, now we have electricity,

01:58.252 --> 02:00.719
and a little bit of power.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.456
Let's add a little more.

02:04.458 --> 02:08.693
After all, the greater the
power, the greater the control.

02:55.876 --> 03:00.379
Imagine how powerful this rod could
become with boundless electricity.

03:01.215 --> 03:04.917
Say, from a lightning bolt?

03:06.220 --> 03:09.755
What else could we control?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.690
Mr. Douglas?

05:53.187 --> 05:54.453
Where is it?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.492
Who took all of her stuff?

06:00.494 --> 06:01.793
What's wrong, Gwen?

06:01.795 --> 06:04.396
Someone stole all of her stuff.
- Whose stuff?

06:04.398 --> 06:07.366
Phoebe. My sister.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.534
She's been on your
team for two years.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.036
I don't remember her.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.137
You don't remember her?

06:12.139 --> 06:14.206
The school doesn't remember her.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.841
No one remembers her.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.646
Stile, an arrangement of steps

06:21.648 --> 06:26.785
that allows people, but not
animals, to climb over a fence.

06:26.787 --> 06:30.088
Yeah, somehow I don't think these
are the Stiles we're looking for.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.890
Maybe Malia's found something.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.825
No. She's been taking
a make-up test all morning.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.040
You have 20 minutes left.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.043
Just try and relax.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.179
Relax?

06:54.181 --> 06:56.848
Breathe in and
feel yourself relaxing.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.608
Malia.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.078
You need to calm your breathing.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.350
Maybe try some
positive self-talk.

07:32.352 --> 07:34.553
I'm positive
I don't want to be here.

07:40.894 --> 07:44.029
Remember,
school is a safe space.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.767
Let's breathe together.
Just one deep breath.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.236
Little deeper.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.844
A little deeper.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.790
I guess the test
isn't going well.

08:14.094 --> 08:17.295
Deep breaths, Natalie.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.798
Deep breaths.

08:31.245 --> 08:34.946
Malia. It's okay.
You're safe.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.150
I'm not gonna hurt you.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.222
I think she's calming down.

08:47.394 --> 08:51.096
Maybe you should growl back?

08:57.271 --> 08:59.905
Scott, you're the Alpha.

08:59.907 --> 09:03.842
Can't you just make her
a little more docile?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.682
She's not the problem.
We are.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.117
This is her territory.

09:12.119 --> 09:13.919
Maybe we need
to get out of here.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.957
Yeah, come on, come on.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.531
Malia came here to get
through the full moons.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.933
Then we started using
the lake house.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.101
I thought you said a wild
animal got in the lake house.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.304
Just be happy about all the
things I don't tell you.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.722
It's all right. I'm okay.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.123
It's all right.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.930
Any idea what made her shift?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.399
She's under a lot of pressure.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.168
School, her life
after graduation.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.403
Her mom trying to kill her.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.305
That shouldn't make her shift.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.242
Could it be connected to Stiles?

10:11.244 --> 10:14.079
Hard to tell since we don't
know what a "Stiles" is.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.180
It's a "he."

10:16.149 --> 10:18.183
Who?
- Stiles.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.785
It's a family nickname.

10:20.787 --> 10:25.223
I never used it
but, uh, my father did.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.867
Thanks, honey.
Mmm-hmm.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.903
He was an army engineer.

10:38.905 --> 10:42.073
Ended the war
one bridge at a time.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.810
And he went by "Stiles."

10:47.714 --> 10:50.215
So, what's this got to do
with the wild hunt?

10:52.119 --> 10:54.119
We think that somebody
was taken from us.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.321
Any idea who?

10:56.323 --> 10:59.224
Uh, the ghost riders would
have erased our memories.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.292
Well, now, that's convenient.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.360
We found a clue.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.631
The word "Stiles."

11:06.633 --> 11:09.200
And that's why you wanna
talk to Elias?

11:09.202 --> 11:10.935
Mm, yeah, maybe he can
help us figure it out.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.538
Maybe he knows
who we're lookin' for.

11:13.540 --> 11:15.073
Now this is someone your age?

11:15.409 --> 11:16.908
Yeah. I...

11:18.578 --> 11:20.245
I think he was my friend.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.883
Maybe he was my best friend.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.120
I can guarantee you,
my father can't help you.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.489
Couldn't we try?

11:31.491 --> 11:35.727
Scott, he lives in a nursing
home three towns over.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.896
Hasn't had a visitor in years.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.550
The following stops
have been canceled.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.754
The following stops
have been canceled.

12:12.365 --> 12:13.498
Can I use your bathroom?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.467
Sure.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.838
Why are you here?

12:57.911 --> 13:00.044
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

13:02.816 --> 13:05.116
What stop has been canceled?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.692
Lydia?

13:14.694 --> 13:17.862
Did you find it?
The last door on the left.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.167
Found it.

13:22.169 --> 13:25.470
You're not hearing me. Trust me,
you don't wanna talk to him.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.805
We just need a few minutes.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.707
Scott, my father can't help you.

13:29.709 --> 13:31.176
Just a few questions.
Five minutes.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.445
You know, what? You don't
just "talk" to this guy.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.281
Okay?

13:37.617 --> 13:38.716
Find another way.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.984
But, what if this is
the only way?

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
Scott, you have your
answer -

13:41.321 --> 13:43.288
Sheriff, please.
Scott.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.294
The answer's no.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.931
Good morning.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.333
You know, normal people knock?

14:29.569 --> 14:32.070
Something tells me you're not
here just to make me coffee.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.572
I need your help.

14:34.574 --> 14:37.609
There's a body in your morgue
and it needs examining,

14:37.611 --> 14:39.277
and you can only
sneak into kitchens?

14:39.279 --> 14:42.347
Actually, I, I wanted your
expertise on something.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.262
What are you lookin' for?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.296
Anything.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.632
Anything to prove
that Phoebe's real.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.333
Hey,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.403
I believe you.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.672
No, you don't.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.344
That was hers, wasn't it?

15:16.449 --> 15:17.949
What happened?

15:19.619 --> 15:22.820
We just went to bed like
any other normal night.

15:22.822 --> 15:27.725
I got up to get some water, and I thought I
saw this man standing in our front yard.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.295
When I looked again,
there was no one there.

15:30.297 --> 15:32.897
But this morning,
my sister was gone.

15:32.899 --> 15:36.401
And her room,
it was completely empty.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.037
I can't reach my mom. And I
tried to call Phoebe's phone

15:39.039 --> 15:41.239
but the line's been
disconnected.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.941
And no one believes
that she exists.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.844
The cops, the school, they're all
saying that there's no record of her.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.113
And everyone's looking
at me like I'm crazy.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.619
I made this for Phoebe
for her birthday.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.987
Mom forgot to buy her anything,

15:55.989 --> 15:58.656
she travels so much.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.658
This is the only thing
I have left.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.194
The man in your yard.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.230
What did he look like?

16:06.232 --> 16:09.133
He had a black hat,
a long coat...

16:10.637 --> 16:12.470
Uh, couldn't see his face.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.538
Shh.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.611
He's called a ghost rider.

16:20.613 --> 16:24.983
They take people and you don't even know
it because they've erased your memories.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.119
If you see them, according
to the mythology,

16:28.822 --> 16:30.521
you're next.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.993
Gwen?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.395
Do you think I'm stupid?

16:37.397 --> 16:39.263
Gwen, I'm trying
to help you. I...

16:39.265 --> 16:42.300
Is this just all
a big joke to you?

16:42.302 --> 16:45.603
I don't believe in ghosts, and I
don't like being made fun of.

17:04.691 --> 17:08.126
I'm gonna go with head trauma
as the cause of death.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.028
The skull wasn't just broken.

17:10.497 --> 17:11.561
Look here.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.298
Those are teeth marks.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.367
A werewolf?

17:17.369 --> 17:21.839
A werewolf with an unusually
powerful set of jaws.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.208
Capable of biting through
a human skull?

17:24.611 --> 17:26.109
Skulls.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.815
This isn't his first victim.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.891
Stilinski said no, didn't he?

17:39.893 --> 17:41.259
Yeah.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.728
But we're going anyway?
Yep.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.497
Or you could stay here and help
me convince Gwen she's in danger.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.232
It's not your job
to convince her.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.634
It's your job to keep her safe.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.669
Just kidnap her.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.605
Do not kidnap her.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.842
We'll be back tonight after
we talk to Stilinski's dad.

17:57.844 --> 17:58.943
Do we really have to do this?

17:58.945 --> 18:00.645
He's our only lead.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.613
Okay. What if
the ghost riders show up?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.917
Then you'll handle it, Liam.

18:05.919 --> 18:10.488
And look, you're not alone. You've got
Mason and Corey and Hayden. Okay?

18:10.490 --> 18:13.858
Just find a safe place
for Gwen and keep her there.

18:14.494 --> 18:15.526
Any suggestions?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.428
It doesn't matter
as long as she's safe.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.200
Kidnap her.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.668
Do not kidnap her.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.306
Until we find
a safe place for Gwen,

18:28.308 --> 18:31.109
we need to know
her location at all times.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.910
Okay, that's great
while we're at school,

18:32.912 --> 18:35.279
but what happens after that?

18:35.849 --> 18:37.115
She could go anywhere.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.750
Hayden could ask her.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.853
We don't have to.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.422
I know where she'll be tonight.

18:44.858 --> 18:46.557
Nathan's party.

18:46.559 --> 18:49.160
I mean, she's been asking
everybody in school about Phoebe.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.596
I'm sure she'll do
the same tonight.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.664
We can't keep her safe
at Nathan's.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.900
We need a place where
supernaturals can't get in.

18:55.902 --> 18:58.169
I know a place.

18:58.872 --> 19:00.438
The safest place.

19:03.710 --> 19:06.410
I can't believe we're about
to break into a nursing home.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.045
After the orderlies
at Eichen house,

19:08.047 --> 19:09.614
pretty sure we can
handle some nurses.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.218
I gotta go.
There's somebody...

19:14.220 --> 19:15.486
I gotta go.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.155
Thing over there
that we were gonna...

19:17.157 --> 19:19.357
Oh! Mother of...

19:47.020 --> 19:48.553
Yes?

19:48.555 --> 19:50.054
Oh.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.224
Is it time for my medicine?

19:53.226 --> 19:54.825
We don't have your medicine.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.361
Oh...

19:59.732 --> 20:01.365
Are you Elias Stilinski?

20:05.004 --> 20:06.270
I am.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.242
I'm Lydia Martin.

20:12.178 --> 20:13.911
Do you know who I am?

20:14.714 --> 20:15.846
Should I?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.548
Hey, Mr. Stilinski,

20:17.550 --> 20:20.718
we're looking for somebody
who might be named Stiles.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.321
You went by that name
in the army, right?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.256
Yes.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.658
Best years of my life.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.695
Do you know any of us?

20:31.264 --> 20:33.231
Of course I do.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.637
How could I forget my own son?

20:41.040 --> 20:42.440
Your son?

20:47.080 --> 20:48.679
Mr. Stilinski.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.382
What year is it?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.517
1976.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.288
It's my son's birthday
next week.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.458
He has dementia.

21:03.796 --> 21:06.397
Is it time for my medicine?

21:30.657 --> 21:32.290
Hey. Not there.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.126
Oh!

21:35.128 --> 21:36.460
You stole my party.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.031
What, are you gonna steal
lacrosse captain, too?

21:40.033 --> 21:41.065
I didn't think you'd be mad.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.133
How'd you think I'd take it?

21:42.135 --> 21:43.401
In hundreds?

21:47.173 --> 21:48.773
Whoo!

21:48.775 --> 21:50.675
I'm starting to think
this wasn't a good idea.

21:50.677 --> 21:53.544
Scott told us to do whatever
it takes to keep Gwen safe.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.346
Now what if Melissa shows up?

21:55.348 --> 21:56.814
She already doesn't like me.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.617
She's got the night shift. She
won't be home until 4:00 am

21:59.619 --> 22:03.587
and we'll have this place
cleaned up way before then.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.457
Scott told us to protect Gwen.

22:06.459 --> 22:12.096
And putting her in a house
lined with mountain ash,

22:13.266 --> 22:14.999
is a good plan.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.067
Believe in the plan.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.772
Scott McCall?

22:23.142 --> 22:27.011
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're my son.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.112
Keep it down, old guy.

22:28.114 --> 22:29.914
You'll wake
the other old people.

22:35.421 --> 22:36.821
I don't like her.

22:39.692 --> 22:41.325
Your son.

22:41.327 --> 22:43.861
He's the sheriff
of Beacon Hills.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.063
Sheriff?

22:46.065 --> 22:50.067
No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
I was in the army.

22:51.437 --> 22:52.870
Use your claws, Scott.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.840
It could kill him.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.875
I get that,
but we're running out of time.

22:57.877 --> 22:58.976
I can't.

23:00.380 --> 23:01.812
Hey!

23:03.549 --> 23:05.750
No. We're not hurting him.

23:07.420 --> 23:11.389
Young lady, you need to
clip those nails.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.348
Made you this.

23:20.349 --> 23:21.232
Uh... you know alcohol
doesn't work on us, right?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.433
What?

23:22.435 --> 23:24.769
Yeah. Our bodies heal
too quickly and we can't...

23:25.872 --> 23:28.973
You know.
You're kidding me, right?

23:30.176 --> 23:31.442
It's not that bad.

23:42.488 --> 23:43.988
Have you seen Gwen?

23:45.057 --> 23:46.424
Over there.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.126
Talking to everyone but me.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.395
Hey, you know what?

23:51.397 --> 23:53.631
If the ghost riders
don't come tonight,

23:53.633 --> 23:55.833
this will be our first
okay date.

23:55.835 --> 24:00.604
And someday, we will do a
whole lot better than "okay."

24:11.918 --> 24:12.983
Mmm!

24:17.356 --> 24:18.789
I better go.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.563
You shouldn't be here.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.032
If you don't leave,

24:28.034 --> 24:29.600
I'll have to report you.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.635
What's wrong with him?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.004
The sun went down.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.105
So?

24:36.342 --> 24:38.042
He's sundowning.

24:38.044 --> 24:41.779
It's when dementia patients lose their
faculties after the sun goes down.

24:41.781 --> 24:46.984
I don't
want to talk to you anymore!

24:46.986 --> 24:48.252
So what do we do?

24:48.254 --> 24:49.653
We wait till
the sun comes back up.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.021
- We can't wait that long.
- No. No, no!

24:51.023 --> 24:53.224
There's gotta be something
we could do to keep him quiet.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.526
Leave, leave, leave, leave.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.794
I can calm him down.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.329
No.
- No.

24:58.331 --> 25:00.364
Elias. Look at the equations.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.665
Look.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.802
It's binomial probability.
What's "p"?

25:06.239 --> 25:09.173
Um, probability of success?

25:09.175 --> 25:10.474
Right.
- Uh...

25:10.476 --> 25:11.876
And that means n minus k is?

25:11.878 --> 25:18.382
Uh, number of trials minus
the number of successes.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.017
What's with the math?

25:20.019 --> 25:21.585
It helps dementia patients
concentrate.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.020
And this one?

25:23.022 --> 25:24.088
That's, um...

25:25.591 --> 25:27.658
Conditional probability.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.162
Let's find
the moment of inertia.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.167
Elias.

25:37.169 --> 25:39.970
That's Mr. Stilinski.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.906
Just who the hell
do you think you are?

25:47.146 --> 25:49.580
Hey, what's wrong?

25:49.582 --> 25:51.181
I just keep thinking
we forgot something.

25:51.183 --> 25:55.586
No. We haven't. Look, Liam's
watching the back door

25:55.588 --> 25:57.254
and Hayden's upstairs with Gwen.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.425
If the ghost riders get in,
I don't know if...

26:01.427 --> 26:02.726
If, if what?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.528
If I can fight like Liam.

26:04.530 --> 26:07.231
Look, no one doubts you.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.234
Not Liam. Not Hayden.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.038
And not me. Okay?

26:16.309 --> 26:18.609
Come on, we got this.

26:19.912 --> 26:20.978
Come on.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.624
Whoa!

26:43.502 --> 26:45.436
You know Scott isn't your son?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.071
Of course I know that.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.673
Are brains getting
smaller with the skirts?

26:49.675 --> 26:51.775
Malia. It's okay.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.279
So you're that McCall kid.

26:55.281 --> 26:56.647
You know me?

26:56.649 --> 26:58.782
I know your dad.

26:58.784 --> 27:00.751
Couldn't hold his liquor
and he certainly

27:00.753 --> 27:03.187
couldn't keep that
wedding ring on his finger.

27:03.189 --> 27:05.656
Pretty young thing would
walk by and poof,

27:05.658 --> 27:08.058
that ring just disappeared
like magic.

27:11.297 --> 27:12.863
Do you know all of us?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.531
Oh...

27:14.533 --> 27:17.468
You're Natalie Martin's girl.
Am I right?

27:17.470 --> 27:18.769
You look like her.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.404
She was pretty once, too.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.439
Stop talking.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.208
Hey, Malia.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.812
And she also liked to talk like she
was the smartest person in the room.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.414
Malia!

27:30.416 --> 27:31.682
Enough.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.218
Sheriff, we...

27:34.220 --> 27:37.688
I explicitly told you
not to come here.

27:37.690 --> 27:40.324
And who attacked a staff member?

27:40.326 --> 27:41.392
That's her.

27:43.663 --> 27:45.062
What the hell were you thinking?

27:45.064 --> 27:48.565
Noah. We were just
having a nice conversation.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.300
The three of you. Out.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.036
Now.

27:52.905 --> 27:53.971
Noah.

27:57.643 --> 27:58.976
That's right!

28:00.312 --> 28:03.814
Act like I'm not even here.

28:03.816 --> 28:09.086
Go crawling back to your dead
wife and your loser son!

28:16.195 --> 28:17.761
What did you say?

28:20.466 --> 28:24.735
Is it time for my medicine?

28:45.124 --> 28:47.024
Sounded like
it was right above us.

28:47.460 --> 28:49.059
I think it was.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.160
What is that?

28:52.765 --> 28:55.299
Oh, my god!

28:55.301 --> 28:57.434
What's wrong?
- I saw him.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.255
He's right there.

29:20.526 --> 29:21.792
Don't you see him?

29:28.534 --> 29:29.633
Help me please!

29:29.635 --> 29:30.901
Wait. Slow down.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.078
Liam, it's a ghost rider.

29:42.047 --> 29:44.381
Where?
- Headed for the kitchen.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.217
Right there.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.115
Everybody out. Now!

30:44.877 --> 30:47.144
Denise Novak.
Found at a campsite,

30:47.146 --> 30:49.012
the back of her head
cracked open.

30:50.416 --> 30:54.251
The size and bite pattern
appear to match.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.653
Seems fair to assume that whoever
took a bite out of Denise

30:56.655 --> 30:58.222
did the same to Mazzara.

30:58.224 --> 31:01.692
It's odd.
Even for Beacon Hills.

31:01.694 --> 31:04.294
Why bite off the back of someone's
head and not take anything?

31:04.296 --> 31:06.663
Well, something was taken
from Denise.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.098
Pineal gland.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.234
Her pineal gland?

31:14.006 --> 31:16.039
That's right in the center
of the brain.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.041
Was anything missing
from Mazzara's brain?

31:23.349 --> 31:24.948
The report doesn't say.

31:27.319 --> 31:29.319
But there's one way
to know for sure.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.302
We can't let him get through.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.149
Guys, he's breaking through.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.973
Okay. We're leaving right now.

32:30.582 --> 32:31.648
Stop!

32:34.553 --> 32:35.652
Go back inside?

32:37.156 --> 32:38.221
Yes.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.524
Now.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.570
Help me!

32:57.676 --> 33:01.011
The coroner found damage to
both of Mazzara's cerebral hemispheres,

33:01.013 --> 33:04.448
but assumed that it was
sustained from the wound.

33:08.721 --> 33:09.987
Hold this.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.494
Okay.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.400
Wow.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.037
Mazzara's pineal gland
is missing.

33:39.618 --> 33:40.717
Freeze!

33:45.791 --> 33:47.157
Let her go!

33:52.731 --> 33:54.464
Shoot him, Parrish.

33:54.466 --> 33:55.665
Everyone down, now.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.219
On your knees.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.629
On your knees.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.274
We know this looks bad.

35:11.276 --> 35:14.411
It doesn't look bad, Scott.
It is bad.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.581
You broke into a nursing home,
you harassed a dementia patient,

35:17.583 --> 35:19.282
and you beat up a nurse.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.618
This could affect
the rest of your lives.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.086
Especially you, Malia.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.455
They're talking felony assault.

35:25.457 --> 35:28.925
I didn't beat him up. I could have.
But I chose not to.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.260
That's an improvement.

35:31.997 --> 35:35.465
By some miracle the nurse
decided to drop the charges.

35:36.268 --> 35:37.534
They're free to go.

35:38.537 --> 35:40.737
Just because
you're not going to jail,

35:40.739 --> 35:43.740
doesn't mean you're not
grounded for eternity.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.578
You've had a long day,
sheriff. You ready?

35:48.580 --> 35:52.716
All I want
is for this day to end.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.951
Well, let me take
you away from all this.

35:54.953 --> 35:57.154
Crime, mayhem, those kids.

35:58.757 --> 36:01.191
Those kids did a dumb thing.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.926
But their heart's
in the right place.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.828
Hmm. Yeah.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.229
You ever have second thoughts?

36:07.299 --> 36:09.599
Us not having kids?

36:10.602 --> 36:11.735
Not once.

36:17.476 --> 36:19.075
Let's get out of here.
All right.

36:19.077 --> 36:20.410
Okay.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.016
You said to find a safe place.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.352
So we brought the party here.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.221
Who said
to throw a party at all?

36:31.223 --> 36:32.722
At least we saved Gwen.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.828
But you saw
one of the ghost riders.

36:38.830 --> 36:41.298
Corey made him visible
so we could fight him.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.399
All right, but doesn't
the book say that

36:42.401 --> 36:44.467
if you see the wild hunt
you'll be taken too?

36:46.004 --> 36:47.537
Everyone at the party saw him.

36:50.776 --> 36:51.841
Does that mean that...

36:51.843 --> 36:53.510
They're all gonna be taken.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.648
I should have been here.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.496
Looks like a hell of a party.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.949
Yeah. Uh...

37:15.950 --> 37:18.746
Hopefully I can get it
all cleaned before my mom comes home.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.836
I'll help.

37:22.874 --> 37:23.940
Hey, sheriff.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.494
I'm really sorry.

37:27.495 --> 37:29.145
We never should have gone
there to see your father.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.281
No, no, it's... it's okay.

37:32.517 --> 37:35.952
I should have been clearer
about who he is.

37:35.954 --> 37:40.690
And maybe a part of me just didn't
want to have to, um, admit it.

37:46.465 --> 37:47.731
This is my dad, Scott.

37:49.468 --> 37:53.036
He pushed me through a glass
table going after my mom.

37:54.506 --> 37:57.374
There's still tiny pieces
of glass in there.

37:57.376 --> 38:01.311
The doctor told my mother that they'd
probably be in there for the rest of my life,

38:01.313 --> 38:02.979
workin' their way out.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.853
Small price to pay to keep him
away from her.

38:11.923 --> 38:13.423
That time.

38:18.230 --> 38:22.332
You know, something you said has
just been bugging me all day.

38:23.201 --> 38:25.535
Somethin' about memories.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.038
What do you mean?

38:28.040 --> 38:30.073
Have you ever had a dream

38:31.343 --> 38:34.044
that's, that's so real

38:34.046 --> 38:35.712
that you thought
it was a memory?

38:38.417 --> 38:42.886
Okay, in this dream,
I'm lying in bed with Claudia.

38:42.888 --> 38:46.690
It's a couple of weeks before
we graduate from college

38:46.692 --> 38:52.629
and we're talking about the future
and kids and what we'll call them.

38:52.631 --> 38:56.366
And I tell her that
if we have a son,

38:56.368 --> 38:58.735
I want to name him
after her father.

39:00.305 --> 39:01.905
And she laughs at me
and she says,

39:01.907 --> 39:05.742
"why would you want to saddle some
poor kid with a name like that?"

39:08.447 --> 39:10.413
And I told her,

39:11.583 --> 39:13.850
"because he's a great father,"

39:15.454 --> 39:17.487
"kind of father I wish I had,"

39:19.591 --> 39:22.058
"the kind I... I hoped to be."

39:24.763 --> 39:30.800
At that point in the dream
she smiles, kisses me,

39:32.270 --> 39:35.939
and says,
"okay, we'll name him that,"

39:38.143 --> 39:39.809
"but it won't matter."

39:41.346 --> 39:43.680
"He'll just be called
Stiles anyway."

39:48.320 --> 39:50.453
It's the size of a pea.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.156
Why kill for it?

39:53.158 --> 39:57.060
The pineal gland is believed
to be the seat of the soul.

39:57.062 --> 40:00.363
A conduit to express our souls
through physical actions.

40:00.365 --> 40:06.202
So someone or something is biting
open heads to what? Steal souls?

40:06.204 --> 40:07.537
Looks that way.

40:09.307 --> 40:13.476
But the real question is why?

40:14.305 --> 40:20.587
