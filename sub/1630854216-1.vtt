00:23.262 --> 00:26.263
Did you know that you
can get married here?

00:26.298 --> 00:27.198
In this old place?

00:27.233 --> 00:28.133
Mm-hmm.

00:28.168 --> 00:29.761
It looks a bit haunted.

00:29.796 --> 00:30.195
What?

00:30.230 --> 00:32.698
No, it doesn't.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.305
I actually think
it's quite romantic.

00:35.340 --> 00:36.108
Romantic?

00:36.143 --> 00:37.373
Mm-hmm.

00:37.408 --> 00:39.540
What happened to getting
married in a church?

00:39.575 --> 00:42.378
Churches are
for boring people.

00:42.413 --> 00:44.908
Hey, you know I'm not boring.

00:44.943 --> 00:47.878
Hey, stop.

00:47.913 --> 00:49.286
Stop.

00:49.321 --> 00:51.156
Don't think you can
just ply me with wine

00:51.191 --> 00:52.553
and then get what you want.

00:52.588 --> 00:53.719
Why not?

00:53.754 --> 00:55.886
It usually works.

00:55.921 --> 00:56.887
Maybe.

00:56.922 --> 00:58.823
But you promised me a massage.

00:58.858 --> 01:01.265
And I will, later.

01:01.300 --> 01:03.234
Later?

01:03.269 --> 01:04.565
That's what you
always say, and then

01:04.600 --> 01:06.270
you just conveniently forget.

01:06.305 --> 01:08.932
But I forgot my oil.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.472
Well, I've got some.

01:10.507 --> 01:11.407
Of course you have.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.148
What was that?

01:16.183 --> 01:17.347
What was what?

01:17.382 --> 01:20.416
I heard something.

01:20.451 --> 01:22.253
It's probably just a fox.

01:22.288 --> 01:26.191
No, it was like a growl.

01:26.226 --> 01:30.459
Do you think it could be, like,
one of them big wild cats?

01:30.494 --> 01:35.431
Babe, there are no big
wild cats around here.

01:35.466 --> 01:36.729
It's probably just a badger.

01:40.636 --> 01:41.767
A badger.

01:41.802 --> 01:42.933
Yes, a badger.

03:45.992 --> 03:46.661
Mike?

04:01.612 --> 04:03.843
Mike, please, you're
scaring me now.

04:03.878 --> 04:04.277
Stop it.

04:04.312 --> 04:09.486
Mike!

04:13.820 --> 04:24.028
Mike?

04:24.030 --> 04:34.643
Mike?

05:29.700 --> 05:30.534
Oh, hi, there.

05:30.569 --> 05:31.865
You must be Dylan.

05:31.900 --> 05:32.800
Yeah, hi.

05:32.835 --> 05:34.098
Welcome to Cedar Manor.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.000
Thank you.

05:35.035 --> 05:35.671
Sorry I'm a bit late.

05:35.706 --> 05:37.068
No problem.

05:37.103 --> 05:39.004
I was starting to think that
the wedding was canceled.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.676
No, I just got held
up at Heathrow.

05:40.711 --> 05:41.677
My flight was delayed.

05:41.712 --> 05:43.008
Oh, been anywhere nice?

05:43.043 --> 05:43.844
China.

05:43.879 --> 05:44.614
Oh.

05:44.649 --> 05:45.208
Business or pleasure?

05:45.243 --> 05:46.616
Business.

05:46.651 --> 05:47.881
I work for an
anti-poaching organization.

05:47.916 --> 05:48.582
Oh, wow.

05:48.617 --> 05:49.883
Well, let me show you around.

05:57.728 --> 06:00.157
So I take it you haven't
been here before.

06:00.192 --> 06:01.598
No.

06:01.633 --> 06:03.864
So we cater for weddings
of all different sizes.

06:03.899 --> 06:07.131
We have extensive grounds
and buildings available.

06:07.166 --> 06:12.840
So you can see we have
the hot tub, sauna,

06:12.875 --> 06:15.480
and a pool, and then
this gazebo right here,

06:15.515 --> 06:17.482
where most people get married.

06:17.517 --> 06:18.747
Sounds idea.

06:18.782 --> 06:21.211
Well, tell me more about
this anti-poaching work.

06:21.246 --> 06:22.982
I'm intrigued.

06:23.017 --> 06:24.918
It's mainly educational,
spreading word

06:24.953 --> 06:27.558
about how killing
animals is wrong.

06:27.593 --> 06:28.988
But there's always
some idiots that

06:29.023 --> 06:31.023
think a ground up rhino horn
will give them a hard-on.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.059
That's just
silly, isn't it?

06:34.094 --> 06:38.129
So are you ever out there in
Africa in the thick of it?

06:38.164 --> 06:38.866
No.

06:38.901 --> 06:39.500
No.

06:39.535 --> 06:40.901
I quit that a while back.

06:40.936 --> 06:42.639
Oh.

06:42.674 --> 06:48.073
My wife, she was
targeted by poachers.

06:48.108 --> 06:53.749
Since the incident, I took a
step back from ranger work.

06:53.784 --> 06:56.081
I'm so sorry to hear that.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.280
These things happen.

06:57.315 --> 06:58.688
I can't imagine.

06:58.723 --> 07:02.021
How can anyone get over
something like that?

07:02.595 --> 07:03.286
Yeah.

07:23.077 --> 07:24.043
Yeah.

07:24.078 --> 07:28.520
Yeah.

07:28.555 --> 07:33.184
Yeah.

07:49.972 --> 07:50.839
Just let it ring.

07:50.874 --> 07:52.742
It's my daughter.

07:52.777 --> 07:54.073
Babe.

07:54.108 --> 07:54.711
I'm coming.

07:54.746 --> 07:56.207
I'm coming.

07:56.242 --> 07:57.208
Yeah, I'm at the venue.

07:57.243 --> 07:59.012
It's great.

07:59.047 --> 08:01.311
They're very accommodating.

08:01.346 --> 08:02.950
You're going to love it.

08:02.985 --> 08:04.215
It's going to be perfect.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.339
Very nice.

08:32.278 --> 08:34.377
It has a certain charm.

08:34.412 --> 08:36.016
A hidden charm.

08:42.695 --> 08:44.123
Hmm.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.389
Rustic.

08:46.424 --> 08:48.358
A tad bougie.

08:48.393 --> 08:49.766
Quite elegant.

08:49.801 --> 08:54.870
Well, I can see what
they're trying to do.

08:54.905 --> 08:57.708
God.

08:57.743 --> 08:59.611
Mine is the four-poster bed.

08:59.646 --> 09:00.139
What?

09:00.174 --> 09:00.678
No.

09:01.406 --> 09:02.779
That's my room, bitch.

09:02.814 --> 09:03.307
Wait.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.080
Ooh, very nice.

09:09.854 --> 09:11.315
Regal.

09:11.350 --> 09:12.789
Boutique?

09:12.824 --> 09:14.153
Functional.

09:14.188 --> 09:15.221
Oh.

09:15.256 --> 09:17.893
And are you going to be
consummating your marriage

09:17.928 --> 09:19.224
in here in 24 hours time?

09:19.259 --> 09:21.094
I'll consummate your
ass in a minute.

09:21.129 --> 09:24.702
Who are you calling?

09:24.737 --> 09:27.903
I'm trying to get
a hold of my dad.

09:27.938 --> 09:31.302
But there is no
bloody reception.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.435
Running late again?

09:32.470 --> 09:34.074
Yep.

09:34.109 --> 09:36.648
You'd think he'd want to be on
time for his only daughter's

09:36.683 --> 09:37.176
wedding.

09:37.211 --> 09:37.748
But--

09:37.783 --> 09:38.782
Oh, chill.

09:38.817 --> 09:41.213
He's probably stuck in traffic.

09:41.248 --> 09:41.950
Yeah.

09:49.223 --> 09:50.662
There you are.

09:52.897 --> 09:53.797
This ain't too shabby.

09:53.832 --> 09:54.699
Hi.

09:57.132 --> 09:59.066
All right, dump your bags.

09:59.101 --> 10:00.463
We are having a cuppa.

10:00.498 --> 10:02.069
Just what the doctor ordered.

10:02.104 --> 10:03.466
I could use something stronger.

10:03.501 --> 10:04.808
Oh, it's that bad, was it?

10:04.843 --> 10:07.107
Just the usual dickheads.

10:07.142 --> 10:09.945
Speaking of which, the boys
should be right behind you.

10:09.980 --> 10:11.144
So come on.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.415
Oh, this is nice.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.955
The boss is actually
making us tea for a change.

10:19.990 --> 10:22.727
Oh, less of your cheek.

10:22.762 --> 10:23.761
Where's Lisa?

10:23.796 --> 10:25.125
She's still trying to get Wi-Fi.

10:25.160 --> 10:26.995
Well, this place is pretty cool.

10:27.030 --> 10:28.799
Amy, did you say you've
been here before?

10:28.834 --> 10:30.031
Yeah, I told Lisa
about this place,

10:30.066 --> 10:31.802
because I'd been here
before with my ex.

10:31.837 --> 10:32.770
Nice.

10:32.805 --> 10:34.002
Did you have a good time?

10:34.037 --> 10:36.169
Can't have been that
good if he's your ex.

10:36.204 --> 10:38.369
Well, we certainly made
use of the hot tub.

10:38.404 --> 10:38.974
Yes, Amy.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.006
Oh, naughty girl.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.307
It hasn't been cleaned since.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.242
I'm not going in it.

10:46.181 --> 10:48.511
Did anyone hear the
story about this place?

10:48.546 --> 10:49.380
Oh, yeah.

10:49.415 --> 10:49.853
No.

10:49.888 --> 10:50.513
No.

10:50.548 --> 10:52.119
What story?

10:52.154 --> 10:59.764
Well, about a year or so
ago, two locals went missing.

10:59.799 --> 11:03.460
The police found the remains
of a party and a torn-up tent

11:03.495 --> 11:07.497
down at the end of the
grounds, but no bodies.

11:07.532 --> 11:08.333
What?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.534
No way.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.138
If you're You telling me that,
I'll never get any sleep.

11:11.173 --> 11:12.271
Oh, babe, you're
sharing a room with me.

11:12.306 --> 11:13.745
You're not getting
any sleep anyway.

11:14.913 --> 11:16.143
Kinky.

11:16.178 --> 11:18.508
Oh, my god, and they
never found them?

11:18.543 --> 11:19.817
No.

11:19.852 --> 11:21.214
And they don't
know what happened.

11:21.249 --> 11:23.051
So the bodies could still
be in the ground somewhere.

11:23.086 --> 11:24.547
Shit, or in the cellar.

11:24.582 --> 11:27.286
Oh, please don't tell me
this place has a cellar.

11:27.321 --> 11:28.221
There might be.

11:28.256 --> 11:29.354
Oh, great choice of location.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.158
There's dead bodies
in the cellar.

11:31.193 --> 11:31.692
Shh.

11:31.727 --> 11:33.963
Dead bodies, where?

11:33.998 --> 11:36.559
Oh, we were just
discussing a horror film.

11:36.594 --> 11:38.902
How'd you get on with the Wi-Fi?

11:38.937 --> 11:41.806
It's still not connecting.

11:41.841 --> 11:43.467
I mean, I unplugged the router.

11:43.502 --> 11:47.812
I reset the whole thing,
and nothing is working.

11:47.847 --> 11:48.978
Why do you need Wi-Fi?

11:49.013 --> 11:50.342
You've got us to entertain you.

11:51.851 --> 11:53.081
It's not that.

11:53.116 --> 11:54.577
It's just I wanted to
livestream the wedding.

11:54.612 --> 11:58.548
And I would use my phone,
but the reception is crap.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.892
And I was promised
that there would be Wi-Fi,

12:01.927 --> 12:03.487
but nothing seems to be working.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.061
And there are people who
aren't going to be here,

12:06.096 --> 12:07.458
like my grandparents.

12:07.493 --> 12:10.593
And I just-- they're all
expecting a livestream from me.

12:10.628 --> 12:11.495
And--

12:11.530 --> 12:13.068
Hey, it'll be all right.

12:13.103 --> 12:14.399
We'll get it fixed.

12:14.434 --> 12:17.336
And if not, it's still
being videoed, isn't it?

12:17.371 --> 12:20.075
The most important thing
is that you and Charlie

12:20.110 --> 12:21.604
are getting married tomorrow.

12:21.639 --> 12:23.815
That is definitely
going to happen.

12:23.850 --> 12:25.278
It's your day.

12:25.313 --> 12:28.347
It's all about you
and Charlie boy--

12:28.382 --> 12:28.952
but mostly you.

12:30.153 --> 12:32.351
Oh, speak of the devil.

12:32.386 --> 12:33.088
Ladies.

12:34.124 --> 12:35.893
Hello, wifey.

12:35.928 --> 12:37.521
Not quite yet.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.490
Is everything all right?

12:39.525 --> 12:40.898
Wi-Fi is down.

12:40.933 --> 12:42.361
Oh, shit.

12:42.396 --> 12:44.495
OK, well, Ben could take
a look at it, right?

12:44.530 --> 12:45.133
Yeah.

12:45.168 --> 12:46.101
Probably, yeah.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.234
All right, .

12:47.269 --> 12:48.433
So shall we get
this party started?

12:49.304 --> 12:50.039
Yes.

12:51.977 --> 12:52.635
Line them up.

12:55.541 --> 12:56.207
Oh, careful.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.278
Oh, don't worry, it won't stain.

12:58.313 --> 13:01.116
She's more worried
about you wasting it.

13:01.151 --> 13:02.348
Don't worry.

13:02.383 --> 13:04.053
There's plenty more
where this came from.

13:04.088 --> 13:04.647
Wifey?

13:04.682 --> 13:05.648
Well, no.

13:05.683 --> 13:07.188
No, I am not really drinking.

13:07.223 --> 13:09.124
And nor should you be.

13:09.159 --> 13:11.192
I don't want you looking
all hungover tomorrow.

13:11.227 --> 13:13.590
Oh, what are you trying to say?

13:13.625 --> 13:16.593
Ben, you are in charge of
making sure he doesn't overdo it

13:16.628 --> 13:17.561
tonight, please.

13:17.596 --> 13:18.430
Yes, ma'am.

13:20.335 --> 13:21.565
Are you drinking this then?

13:21.600 --> 13:22.401
Absolutely.

13:22.436 --> 13:23.138
OK, fill her up.

13:23.173 --> 13:24.535
All right, come on.

13:24.570 --> 13:25.602
Don't be shy.

13:25.637 --> 13:26.438
I'm not being shy.

13:26.473 --> 13:26.977
More?

13:27.012 --> 13:27.472
More.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.011
Yeah?

13:28.046 --> 13:28.539
More.

13:28.574 --> 13:29.078
More?

13:31.247 --> 13:32.147
Chin, chin, Benjamin.

13:32.182 --> 13:33.412
Cheers, mate.

13:33.447 --> 13:37.317
Ladies and this muppet,
I'd like to thank you

13:37.352 --> 13:43.158
all for coming to watch me
marry this absolute beauty.

13:43.193 --> 13:45.930
Here's to an
unforgettable wedding.

13:45.965 --> 13:46.458
Whoo!

13:46.493 --> 13:46.997
Cheers.

13:47.032 --> 13:47.492
Cheers!

13:47.527 --> 13:48.031
Cheers!

13:48.066 --> 13:48.361
Cheers!

13:52.037 --> 13:53.498
Yes, with the palm trees.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.006
With the cocktails, those
really good cocktails.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.007
What was that guy's name?

13:57.042 --> 13:57.667
The--

13:57.702 --> 13:59.009
Umbrellas and--

13:59.044 --> 13:59.944
It was like
or something.

13:59.979 --> 14:00.571
That's my dad.

14:00.606 --> 14:01.638
Be right back.

14:01.673 --> 14:02.342
OK.

14:13.157 --> 14:15.190
And what time do you call this?

14:15.225 --> 14:16.257
I'm sorry, babe.

14:18.998 --> 14:20.261
You know how it is--

14:20.296 --> 14:23.528
work commitments.

14:23.563 --> 14:24.936
So where's my room?

14:24.971 --> 14:26.234
Come on, this way.

14:32.242 --> 14:35.243
I'm afraid you're stuck
with a single room,

14:35.278 --> 14:40.149
although I'm not sure you're
going to fit in this bed.

14:40.184 --> 14:41.150
Don't worry.

14:41.185 --> 14:43.119
Reminds me of the ranger ways--

14:43.154 --> 14:44.582
teeny, tiny camp beds.

14:54.429 --> 14:56.759
i can't believe my little
girl is getting married.

14:56.794 --> 14:58.695
I'm not a little girl anymore.

14:58.730 --> 15:02.534
I am all grown up, with
a job and everything.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.766
You call it a job.

15:03.801 --> 15:06.307
But we both know,
fashion isn't a real job.

15:06.342 --> 15:09.541
Fashion isn't a real job.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.709
Don't let Vanessa hear you say
that. she'd probably slap you.

15:12.744 --> 15:15.778
To be honest, I think
you'd come off second best.

15:15.813 --> 15:16.581
Sounds hot.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.386
Oh, Dad.

15:19.421 --> 15:22.290
No, I think you two would
actually get on really well.

15:22.325 --> 15:24.061
I don't know.

15:24.096 --> 15:26.789
Maybe it's time to--

15:26.824 --> 15:28.560
Lisa.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.430
Dad, come on.

15:30.465 --> 15:34.401
It's been a long time since--

15:34.436 --> 15:36.733
I just want to see
you happy again.

15:36.768 --> 15:37.800
I know.

15:37.835 --> 15:39.274
I know, yes.

15:39.309 --> 15:40.803
That reminds me.

15:40.838 --> 15:41.904
I've got something for you.

15:44.842 --> 15:50.153
I believe the traditional
rhyme goes, something old.

15:50.188 --> 15:53.024
I got this for your Mum
when we were in Africa.

15:55.853 --> 15:58.392
And I want you to have it.

16:01.199 --> 16:02.726
Thank you.

16:02.761 --> 16:05.102
Now, don't get emotional.

16:05.137 --> 16:07.302
You go join the party.

16:07.337 --> 16:10.503
I'll be down in a second.

16:25.751 --> 16:30.160
Oh, you surprised me.

16:30.195 --> 16:32.261
Hi, I'm Vanessa.

16:32.296 --> 16:33.658
Dylan.

16:33.693 --> 16:34.292
We--

16:34.327 --> 16:37.101
We met before, didn't we?

16:37.136 --> 16:39.235
Yeah, the--

16:39.270 --> 16:43.140
The Christmas party
at the sky garden.

16:43.175 --> 16:47.507
Ah, yes, a little
glitzy for my taste.

16:47.542 --> 16:52.182
Yes, I remember you saying that
you didn't really do fashion.

16:52.910 --> 16:54.415
Hmm.

16:54.450 --> 16:58.782
Well, you certainly know
how to pick out a shirt.

16:58.817 --> 17:00.751
That's saying something.

17:00.786 --> 17:04.194
Well, it is just a
shirt and trousers.

17:04.229 --> 17:07.164
I can't really get that wrong.

17:07.199 --> 17:08.528
You'd be surprised.

17:11.335 --> 17:13.368
Can I get you a drink?

17:13.403 --> 17:16.536
Absolutely.

17:16.571 --> 17:19.506
I see you two are
getting reacquainted.

17:20.806 --> 17:23.444
Vanessa's just giving
me some fashion tips.

17:23.479 --> 17:26.645
Oh, well, I've been trying
to do that for years.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.648
But it sounds like you're having
a lot more success than I ever

17:29.683 --> 17:31.815
did, so I'll leave
you guys to it.

17:51.507 --> 17:52.836
What do you think you're doing?

17:52.871 --> 17:53.540
Now kiss!

17:53.575 --> 17:53.903
Kiss!

18:06.357 --> 18:07.752
I am going to go to bed.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.492
Oh, OK, honey.

18:11.527 --> 18:14.198
Don't stay up too late.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.959
I thought we were going to
wait until we were married

18:16.994 --> 18:18.565
for you to start nagging me.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.831
Yeah, well, I am
just practicing.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.307
Good night, everyone.

18:24.342 --> 18:24.835
Night.

18:24.870 --> 18:25.335
Night.

18:29.248 --> 18:32.348
Hey, how's it going?

18:32.383 --> 18:36.880
How about me and you go
walk around the grounds.

18:36.915 --> 18:42.754
Oh, I'm pretty quiet tired,
so better catch some Zs.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.293
Really?

18:43.328 --> 18:44.525
Yeah.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.922
Oh, maybe tomorrow then.

18:50.665 --> 18:52.236
Don't worry about it, mate.

18:52.271 --> 18:53.633
She'll be up for it tomorrow.

18:53.668 --> 18:56.273
Bridesmaids are always
gagging for it on the day, OK?

18:56.308 --> 18:56.867
Yeah.

18:56.902 --> 18:57.604
So chin up.

18:57.639 --> 18:58.473
Go get some rest.

18:58.508 --> 18:59.342
I'll clean up here, OK?

18:59.377 --> 18:59.903
All right.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.812
Hi, there.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.518
Hi.

19:10.553 --> 19:14.324
So you've been making
eyes at me all night.

19:14.359 --> 19:16.920
Thought there was
something on my face.

19:16.955 --> 19:19.362
Could be if you want it to.

19:19.397 --> 19:21.925
Oh, yeah?

19:21.960 --> 19:22.728
Such as?

19:26.602 --> 19:31.033
See, I think it's just
better if I show you.

19:31.068 --> 19:37.776
My heart is saying, no.

19:37.811 --> 19:40.647
But you're dick's saying, yes.

19:40.682 --> 19:43.012
Your dick always says, yes.

19:43.047 --> 19:44.915
Come on.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.522
She's not married yet.

19:49.328 --> 19:49.821
True.

19:52.760 --> 19:53.392
Who knows?

19:56.401 --> 19:58.060
We'll before then.

19:58.095 --> 19:59.237
Come on.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.538
I'm coming.

20:03.573 --> 20:05.067
Tell you what,
Georgie, you'd better

20:05.102 --> 20:06.442
be leading me out to my death.

20:06.477 --> 20:07.872
My god, don't be so ridiculous.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.320
What is this place?

20:19.622 --> 20:21.589
Georgie, it's a--

20:21.624 --> 20:23.558
Don't complain.

20:23.593 --> 20:25.087
It's a nice place.

20:25.122 --> 20:27.397
Jesus Christ.

20:27.432 --> 20:28.596
This all right?

20:36.133 --> 20:37.341
We shouldn't be doing this.

20:37.376 --> 20:37.869
It's OK.

20:37.904 --> 20:38.507
Come on.

20:38.542 --> 20:39.101
You wanted this.

20:39.136 --> 20:39.904
The torch.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.004
Fuck the torch.

20:41.039 --> 20:45.976
Yeah, come on.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.846
I'm coming.

20:47.881 --> 20:48.550
Yeah.

20:55.460 --> 20:59.462
Bet Lisa doesn't fuck
you like this, eh?

20:59.497 --> 21:02.531
I love it when you go hard.

21:14.380 --> 21:16.006
It's all right,
probably just a fox.

21:20.485 --> 21:21.649
What's that?

21:42.837 --> 21:43.737
Georgie.

21:43.772 --> 21:44.474
Georgie!

21:44.509 --> 21:45.101
Georgie, the window!

21:46.511 --> 21:47.972
The sill, it's stuck.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.941
Come on!

21:49.976 --> 21:50.942
Come on!

22:06.091 --> 22:06.958
Oh, Georgie.

22:10.568 --> 22:11.160
Fuck!

22:12.504 --> 22:13.195
Georgie.

23:07.592 --> 23:14.256
All set for the big day?

23:14.291 --> 23:14.927
Yeah.

23:14.962 --> 23:16.896
You?

23:16.931 --> 23:17.468
Yeah.

23:24.774 --> 23:26.972
Don't fuck this up.

23:46.796 --> 23:48.499
Where'd you go, mate?

23:48.534 --> 23:52.734
Uh, just for a wander.

23:58.544 --> 24:01.677
You didn't see Georgie,
did you, on your travels?

24:01.712 --> 24:03.976
She wasn't in her room.

24:04.011 --> 24:05.846
No.

24:05.881 --> 24:08.112
Bet she's playing hard to get.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.521
Ben?

24:10.556 --> 24:11.082
Yeah?

24:13.559 --> 24:16.054
Nothing.

24:16.089 --> 24:16.725
Good night.

24:23.096 --> 24:25.668
Morning, bridey.

24:25.703 --> 24:27.604
Morning.

24:27.639 --> 24:30.266
You're
getting married today.

24:30.301 --> 24:31.872
Stop.

24:31.907 --> 24:34.138
It's not normal to have this
much energy in the morning.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.613
Plant-based diet,
I keep telling you.

24:36.648 --> 24:37.141
No.

24:37.176 --> 24:37.942
No way.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.815
I'm not giving up
my meat, bacon.

24:40.850 --> 24:45.083
Speaking of, can I bring
you some breakfast?

24:45.118 --> 24:45.784
Oh, no.

24:45.819 --> 24:47.657
No, I don't want to be bloated.

24:47.692 --> 24:49.252
OK, but at least eat something.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.891
Nobody wants a dead bride.

24:53.698 --> 24:54.664
Piece of bacon?

24:54.699 --> 24:55.225
Oh, please.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.568
Amazing.

24:57.603 --> 24:58.998
We seem to be missing the bride.

24:59.033 --> 25:01.099
Oh, she's just staying in her
room until the big moment.

25:01.134 --> 25:02.639
We don't want to see the groom.

25:02.674 --> 25:03.838
It's bad luck.

25:03.873 --> 25:05.103
What about the groom?

25:05.138 --> 25:06.874
Oh, he's still in bed
pending bacon sammy.

25:06.909 --> 25:08.007
Has anyone seen Georgie?

25:08.042 --> 25:09.371
Probably still
trying to avoid Ben.

25:10.374 --> 25:11.241
What?

25:11.276 --> 25:12.108
Nothing.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.683
She's staying in
your room, isn't she?

25:13.718 --> 25:14.849
Well, I thought
so, but she wasn't

25:14.884 --> 25:16.147
there before I went to sleep.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.081
Oh, weird.

25:17.117 --> 25:18.314
Oh, my god, do you
think she's with Dylan?

25:18.349 --> 25:19.854
No.

25:19.889 --> 25:21.185
I didn't think he was her type.

25:21.220 --> 25:21.988
Is he?

25:22.023 --> 25:23.385
Well, that settles it.

25:23.420 --> 25:24.661
Settles what?

25:24.696 --> 25:26.388
Oh, well, maybe
she was with Amy.

25:26.423 --> 25:27.697
Who?

25:27.732 --> 25:28.995
Was Georgie staying
in your room?

25:29.030 --> 25:29.529
No.

25:29.564 --> 25:32.636
Must be Dylan then.

25:32.671 --> 25:33.901
Dylan?

25:33.936 --> 25:35.705
You're doing Lisa's hair
and makeup, aren't you?

25:35.740 --> 25:36.871
Yeah.

25:36.906 --> 25:38.037
When you go up,
take that with you.

25:38.072 --> 25:39.170
Try to get her to
eat at least some.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.139
Yeah, sure thing.

25:41.174 --> 25:43.878
All right, ladies, I'm going
to take this to the groom.

25:43.913 --> 25:45.044
See you at the wedding.

25:45.079 --> 25:45.616
Bye.

25:45.651 --> 25:48.718
All right.

25:48.753 --> 25:49.818
I ain't got a napkin.

25:52.416 --> 25:53.085
Brekkies.

25:55.826 --> 25:56.319
Cheers.

26:01.766 --> 26:03.898
You all right, mate?

26:03.933 --> 26:05.130
Are you a bit nervous?

26:10.104 --> 26:17.175
What I'm about to tell you
does not leave this room.

26:17.210 --> 26:18.042
All right.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.276
Yeah, that's what
best men are for.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.314
Last night--

26:24.349 --> 26:25.249
Yeah?

26:25.284 --> 26:27.218
--I was with Georgie.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.660
Oh.

26:29.695 --> 26:30.958
I'm sorry, mate.

26:30.993 --> 26:32.223
We go way back.

26:32.258 --> 26:37.998
And we've always been
fond of each other.

26:38.033 --> 26:40.671
Hey, it's not the
end of the world.

26:43.368 --> 26:45.742
and you
get on to me now.

26:45.777 --> 26:46.270
So--

26:49.374 --> 26:52.342
No, that's not it.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.243
No?

26:53.278 --> 26:58.216
While we were at it,
we were attacked.

26:58.251 --> 27:00.218
Attacked?

27:00.253 --> 27:01.923
This is going to sound insane--

27:06.765 --> 27:09.359
by a giant crocodile.

27:09.394 --> 27:11.801
A crocodile?

27:11.836 --> 27:14.364
It got Georgie.

27:14.399 --> 27:15.134
Wait.

27:15.169 --> 27:17.136
This is a prank, right?

27:17.171 --> 27:17.906
No.

27:17.941 --> 27:21.140
No, I'm dead serious.

27:21.175 --> 27:29.852
It came out of nowhere,
just bit her in half.

27:29.887 --> 27:31.414
What's a crocodile
doing around here?

27:35.420 --> 27:36.019
I don't know.

27:36.054 --> 27:37.420
Ben, that doesn't matter.

27:40.161 --> 27:43.063
The thing is I can't tell
anyone, because then they will

27:43.098 --> 27:44.460
know that I was with Georgie.

27:44.495 --> 27:54.140
And the wedding-- just keep
an eye out for it in case

27:54.175 --> 27:56.340
it, like, shows up.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.044
All right.

28:10.796 --> 28:11.520
Oh, you look lovely.

28:11.555 --> 28:12.290
Hi.

28:12.325 --> 28:14.226
Are you OK?

28:14.261 --> 28:15.524
Charlie.

28:15.559 --> 28:16.932
Charlie!

28:16.967 --> 28:17.933
Dad.

28:17.968 --> 28:18.461
Hi.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.462
Hi, Mom.

28:19.497 --> 28:20.232
Hello, darling.

28:20.267 --> 28:21.772
How are you?

28:21.807 --> 28:24.533
Yeah, I'm OK, yeah.

28:24.568 --> 28:25.908
You seem a bit anxious.

28:25.943 --> 28:27.074
Why so nervous?

28:27.109 --> 28:28.339
This is the easy bit.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.309
It's the next 50 years
that's the hard bit.

28:31.344 --> 28:35.082
Just keep your eyes peeled, OK?

28:53.498 --> 28:56.400
My beautiful daughter.

28:56.435 --> 28:56.939
Hi.

28:56.974 --> 28:59.601
Sorry.

28:59.636 --> 29:01.504
You look stunning, darling.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.242
Thank you.

29:03.277 --> 29:05.178
You don't know where
Georgie is, do you?

29:05.213 --> 29:06.245
No.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.478
It's just that we
kind of thought--

29:08.513 --> 29:10.084
never mind.

29:10.119 --> 29:11.855
No one's seen her this morning.

29:11.890 --> 29:13.252
We have no idea where she is.

29:13.287 --> 29:15.287
Where could she have gone?

29:15.322 --> 29:17.388
She had a few drinks
last night, yeah?

29:17.423 --> 29:19.291
Yeah.

29:19.326 --> 29:21.260
She hasn't got a
reason to vanish--

29:21.295 --> 29:25.264
I mean, her depression, anxiety?

29:25.299 --> 29:27.035
No.

29:27.070 --> 29:28.839
Can she swim?

29:28.874 --> 29:30.401
I think so.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.634
OK, I'm going to
scout the grounds.

29:32.669 --> 29:33.943
You stay here.

29:33.978 --> 29:34.471
OK.

32:59.480 --> 33:04.120
I hate to say this, but I've got
another appointment after this.

33:04.155 --> 33:05.682
Oh, OK.

33:05.717 --> 33:06.485
All right, yeah.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.097
Must be so proud.

33:14.132 --> 33:15.329
Hmm.

33:15.364 --> 33:18.596
We can't find Georgie.

33:18.631 --> 33:19.163
OK.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.269
Can we go without her?

33:21.304 --> 33:22.765
Without?

33:22.800 --> 33:23.865
Dylan's looking for her now.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.042
Give us a few minutes.

33:28.806 --> 33:30.113
No word?

33:30.148 --> 33:31.609
No.

33:31.644 --> 33:33.611
The reverend is
getting impatient.

33:33.646 --> 33:37.120
We may have to go ahead anyway.

33:37.155 --> 33:38.352
One must go.

33:38.387 --> 33:39.188
Fingers crossed.

33:46.230 --> 33:46.822
Fuck.

33:49.926 --> 33:50.892
Oh, shit.

34:01.839 --> 34:03.377
Shit.

34:03.412 --> 34:04.708
If he doesn't turn
up in two minutes,

34:04.743 --> 34:07.216
we'll have to go
ahead without him.

34:07.251 --> 34:08.580
No.

34:08.615 --> 34:11.220
No, there's no way I'm getting
married without my dad.

34:11.255 --> 34:12.551
You might have to, babe.

34:15.589 --> 34:18.392
Who's going of walk
me down the aisle?

34:18.427 --> 34:19.723
Well, I can't, can I?

34:19.758 --> 34:20.757
That would be weird.

34:23.762 --> 34:24.795
I guess I could.

34:24.830 --> 34:27.434
I've almost been like a
surrogate parent, anyway.

34:30.208 --> 34:31.273
I'd like that.

35:10.006 --> 35:11.973
Where's her dad?

35:12.008 --> 35:13.183
We can't find him.

35:13.218 --> 35:13.777
What?

35:13.812 --> 35:14.745
It's fine.

35:23.019 --> 35:24.755
Hey, you come with a package.

35:41.774 --> 35:46.282
Ladies and gentlemen-- in these
days, I'm obligated to say,

35:46.317 --> 35:49.813
and those who
identify as neither--

35:49.848 --> 35:51.947
it's lovely to see
you all here today.

35:51.982 --> 35:54.290
And I'm so glad that you
could make the journey

35:54.325 --> 35:55.522
in these difficult times.

35:58.054 --> 35:58.888
Dearly beloved--

35:59.991 --> 36:03.332
--we are gathered here
today in the presence of--

36:06.535 --> 36:08.799
All mighty god!

36:33.397 --> 36:33.923
Get up.

36:33.958 --> 36:34.357
Get up.

36:34.392 --> 36:35.463
Come on, get up.

36:35.498 --> 36:35.991
Get up.

36:36.026 --> 36:36.794
Get up.

36:36.829 --> 36:37.432
Hey, come on.

36:37.467 --> 36:38.026
Come on. get up.

36:38.061 --> 36:39.027
Get up.

36:39.062 --> 36:40.028
Sarah, there's two of them.

36:40.063 --> 36:41.733
Sarah, there's two of them.

36:46.069 --> 36:46.804
Wait.

36:47.345 --> 36:47.838
Stop.

36:47.873 --> 36:48.377
Stop.

36:48.412 --> 36:48.872
Stop.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.378
Go.

36:49.413 --> 36:49.873
Go.

36:49.908 --> 36:50.379
Go.

36:50.414 --> 36:50.874
Go.

36:50.909 --> 36:51.380
Go.

36:51.415 --> 36:51.941
Go.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.327
Tara.

37:04.362 --> 37:05.361
Oh, my god.

37:05.396 --> 37:06.494
Tara, we got to go.

37:06.529 --> 37:10.927
Fuck.

37:16.473 --> 37:17.439
Running for my car.

37:17.474 --> 37:19.408
My car's around the corner.

37:29.783 --> 37:31.387
Wait.

37:31.422 --> 37:31.915
In here.

37:31.950 --> 37:32.619
In here.

37:41.091 --> 37:43.025
What the fuck just happened?

37:43.060 --> 37:44.026
I don't know.

37:47.636 --> 37:48.569
Get it open.

37:54.137 --> 37:55.675
Fuck.

37:55.710 --> 37:59.041
Oh, guys, I'm going
to need first aid.

37:59.076 --> 38:00.944
What is happening?

38:00.979 --> 38:01.945
Why is this happening?

38:01.980 --> 38:04.013
Why is this happening
to me on my wedding day?

38:05.456 --> 38:07.148
First, my bridesmaid
goes missing.

38:07.183 --> 38:09.425
And Then my dad goes missing.

38:09.460 --> 38:09.953
And then--

38:17.534 --> 38:18.797
Do you think it got them?

38:18.832 --> 38:22.372
Do you think it's
eaten them as well?

38:22.407 --> 38:23.406
What if it bites us?

38:23.441 --> 38:25.100
What if it gets in here?

38:25.135 --> 38:26.035
Don't worry.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.971
It can't get in here.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.550
Let me in!

38:40.491 --> 38:41.149
It's the reverend.

38:45.463 --> 38:46.055
Thank you.

38:46.090 --> 38:48.189
Thank you.

38:48.224 --> 38:49.399
Are you all right?

38:49.434 --> 38:51.434
Yes, I'm alive, thank god.

38:51.469 --> 38:53.502
But others weren't so lucky.

38:53.537 --> 38:54.668
Is it just you?

38:54.703 --> 38:55.735
Did you see anyone else?

38:55.770 --> 38:57.968
Have you seen Amy or V, my dad?

38:58.003 --> 38:58.835
I don't know.

38:58.871 --> 39:00.608
Everyone went in
different directions.

39:00.643 --> 39:02.676
So what do we do?

39:02.711 --> 39:06.449
Well, call emergency
services, and then

39:06.484 --> 39:08.847
hope that thing doesn't get
anyone else in the meantime.

39:08.882 --> 39:10.618
It's going to be
easier said than done.

39:10.653 --> 39:11.520
There's no bars.

39:11.555 --> 39:12.851
Is there a landline?

39:12.886 --> 39:13.588
No.

39:14.558 --> 39:15.689
Great.

39:15.724 --> 39:18.956
Then we're fucked.

39:18.991 --> 39:20.694
Sorry.

39:20.729 --> 39:21.992
Don't worry.

39:22.027 --> 39:25.633
I think I may have just
said similar words myself.

39:25.668 --> 39:27.536
What now then?

39:27.571 --> 39:29.032
Let's pray.

39:29.067 --> 39:33.102
Dear heavenly father, we pray
for your help in these trying

39:33.137 --> 39:34.170
times.

39:34.205 --> 39:38.107
We pray for you to look
after us and to protect us

39:38.142 --> 39:39.075
against the beast.

39:48.757 --> 39:49.855
Where's Neil?

39:49.890 --> 39:52.858
I've got to find Neil.

39:52.893 --> 39:54.057
No.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.191
He went the other way.

39:56.226 --> 39:58.633
The car keys.

39:58.668 --> 39:59.535
No.

39:59.570 --> 40:00.998
Neil's got the keys.

40:01.033 --> 40:03.033
Maybe we can make it to the car.

40:21.251 --> 40:23.218
It's there.

40:23.253 --> 40:24.692
Shh.

40:24.727 --> 40:26.925
Don't make a sound.

40:29.226 --> 40:30.192
Where's Lisa?

40:30.227 --> 40:31.259
We have to find Lisa.

40:31.294 --> 40:32.161
Don't worry.

40:32.196 --> 40:33.362
I'm sure she's fine.

40:33.397 --> 40:35.164
The most important thing is
we get safe and we get help.

40:35.199 --> 40:36.033
OK.

40:36.068 --> 40:37.034
Let's try and get to my car.

40:37.069 --> 40:38.068
I've got keys.

40:54.988 --> 40:55.492
No!

40:59.960 --> 41:01.091
Tabby?

41:01.126 --> 41:02.026
I'll start it up.

41:19.584 --> 41:22.145
OK, pull yourself together.

41:22.180 --> 41:26.248
When in times of stress, always
go back to your breathing.

41:32.663 --> 41:35.092
Fuck.

41:35.127 --> 41:36.027
Oh, come on.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.036
Tabby?

41:51.341 --> 41:52.010
God.

41:54.817 --> 41:56.278
It's all right.

41:56.313 --> 41:58.247
You're going to be OK.

41:58.282 --> 42:00.249
Let's get you to the car.

42:13.902 --> 42:15.000
Maybe we should go back.

42:15.035 --> 42:16.001
They might be
wondering where we are.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.233
Or if we're still alive.

42:19.908 --> 42:22.139
Maybe we should just
wait here and see

42:22.174 --> 42:25.615
if someone comes and finds us.

42:31.656 --> 42:34.151
Sarah, don't move.

42:41.391 --> 42:43.831
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

42:43.866 --> 42:45.294
Oh, my god, what do we do?

42:45.329 --> 42:46.295
Find a way out.

42:49.740 --> 42:52.334
It's locked.

42:52.369 --> 42:53.841
We need to get out of here.

43:09.155 --> 43:10.121
Help!

43:10.156 --> 43:12.090
Sarah, help!

43:12.125 --> 43:12.662
Sarah!

43:34.411 --> 43:36.785
Christ, you scared
the shit out of me.

43:36.820 --> 43:37.786
Sorry.

43:37.821 --> 43:40.822
You couldn't be heard screaming.

43:40.857 --> 43:42.285
What the hell is that?

43:42.320 --> 43:43.286
And where is it?

43:43.321 --> 43:46.421
It's a crocodile, but I
don't know what species.

43:46.456 --> 43:48.423
I thought you were an expert.

43:48.458 --> 43:49.963
Not exactly.

43:49.998 --> 43:52.966
But I do know it shouldn't
be living in this climate.

43:53.001 --> 43:55.705
And it's also very dangerous.

43:55.740 --> 43:57.432
Tell me something I don't know.

43:57.467 --> 43:58.939
You got a twig in your hair.

44:02.406 --> 44:03.108
Good.

44:03.143 --> 44:04.010
Let me untangle it.

44:13.285 --> 44:16.352
Is that your distressed look?

44:20.160 --> 44:22.061
You didn't answer my question.

44:22.096 --> 44:27.132
Yes, it's out there.

44:27.167 --> 44:30.839
And how are we going to kill it?

44:30.874 --> 44:33.468
I don't intend to kill it.

44:33.503 --> 44:34.942
I intend to catch it.

44:39.212 --> 44:42.411
All right, we need a plan.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.919
Agreed.

44:44.954 --> 44:46.316
Don't look at me.

44:46.351 --> 44:48.791
I'm qualified to give spiritual
guidance and the like.

44:48.826 --> 44:53.026
Escaping man-eating crocodiles
is not my speciality.

44:53.061 --> 44:56.029
We just need to kill
the bloody thing.

44:56.064 --> 44:59.967
So let's find a big gun
and shoot the bastard.

45:00.002 --> 45:04.334
And where do you propose
we get a gun from?

45:04.369 --> 45:08.074
There was a pair of
shotguns on the farm.

45:08.109 --> 45:10.109
Great.

45:10.144 --> 45:12.573
I'll just teleport to your
parents' farm then and get one,

45:12.608 --> 45:13.981
shall we?

45:14.016 --> 45:17.314
All right, guns are out.

45:17.349 --> 45:18.986
Are we going to kill this thing?

45:19.021 --> 45:20.790
We don't have to kill it.

45:20.825 --> 45:22.957
It's still one of
God's creatures.

45:22.992 --> 45:25.388
And it's clearly upset.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.060
It's upset?

45:27.095 --> 45:28.963
The crocodile is upset?

45:28.998 --> 45:31.460
Oh,
that's all right then

45:31.495 --> 45:34.067
that everybody's dying,
because the crocodile

45:34.102 --> 45:36.102
is having a bad day.

45:36.137 --> 45:36.971
I didn't mean-

45:37.006 --> 45:39.138
I am upset, OK?

45:39.173 --> 45:42.504
In case you hadn't noticed,
my wedding day is ruined.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.979
And people we know are dead.

45:45.014 --> 45:47.575
Right.

45:47.610 --> 45:50.215
Just calm down.

45:50.250 --> 45:52.580
Don't tell me to calm down.

45:58.962 --> 46:01.622
At least we aren't
live streaming this.

46:01.657 --> 46:03.294
Can you imagine?

46:03.329 --> 46:06.330
At least then someone
would come to our rescue.

46:08.972 --> 46:20.311
Oh, god, I
wish my dad was here.

46:20.346 --> 46:26.053
He'd know what to do, if
he's even still out there.

46:26.088 --> 46:27.956
If anyone knows how to
deal with a crocodile,

46:27.991 --> 46:29.221
it's definitely your dad.

46:33.359 --> 46:33.929
Shit.

46:33.964 --> 46:34.831
It's Amy.

47:00.716 --> 47:01.583
Oh, my god.

47:01.618 --> 47:02.320
Fuck.

47:09.197 --> 47:09.932
Oh, shit.

47:09.967 --> 47:10.658
Shit.

47:10.693 --> 47:12.935
Come on, Amy, drive.

47:12.970 --> 47:15.135
It's relentless.

47:21.110 --> 47:22.241
Catch it?

47:22.276 --> 47:23.506
What do you mean, catch it?

47:23.541 --> 47:27.477
Exactly that- take it
to a zoo, and tag it.

47:27.512 --> 47:28.711
Really?

47:28.747 --> 47:31.481
So that thing has been rampage
at your daughter's wedding,

47:31.516 --> 47:33.186
killed I don't know
how many people,

47:33.221 --> 47:36.024
and you want to catch
it and keep it as a pet?

47:36.059 --> 47:36.992
That's what I do.

47:37.027 --> 47:37.652
I protect animals.

47:37.687 --> 47:38.994
Protect them?

47:39.029 --> 47:41.359
What about the humans
that have died?

47:41.394 --> 47:46.034
So you don't
care about humans.

47:46.069 --> 47:47.398
Some of them.

47:47.433 --> 47:49.268
Well, I bet you'd have a
different view if that thing

47:49.303 --> 47:51.633
got your daughter.

47:51.668 --> 47:53.338
She'll be fine.

47:53.373 --> 47:55.373
Not to put a damper on
things, but how do you know?

47:55.408 --> 47:57.276
That thing could have got
her like it got Tabby.

47:57.311 --> 47:58.541
Practically bit her in half.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.048
And it got the camera
man and chewed him and--

48:00.083 --> 48:01.511
Because I know, all right.

48:04.516 --> 48:05.282
She'll be fine.

48:05.317 --> 48:07.055
Yeah, that's easy
for you to say.

48:07.090 --> 48:09.222
It didn't attack you.

48:09.257 --> 48:11.719
Yes, it did.

48:11.754 --> 48:13.655
Shit.

48:13.690 --> 48:15.558
When did that happen?

48:15.593 --> 48:18.363
Earlier in the barn.

48:18.398 --> 48:19.628
Oh, god, it looks nasty.

48:19.663 --> 48:21.300
Let me take a look.

48:24.107 --> 48:25.271
Shit, there it is.

48:31.015 --> 48:32.443
Shit, Amy's in trouble.

48:34.744 --> 48:39.582
Heavenly father, we beseech
you to help our friend Amy

48:39.617 --> 48:40.683
in her time of need.

48:40.718 --> 48:44.257
Please forgive her her
sins, whatever they may be.

48:44.292 --> 48:48.525
And deliver her safely to
us, just like your son,

48:48.560 --> 48:52.067
our savior, Jesus Christ,
delivered us from evil.

48:52.102 --> 48:52.601
Amen.

48:55.303 --> 48:57.732
One question, reverend.

48:57.767 --> 49:00.438
Where was your holy father
when the crocodile started

49:00.473 --> 49:02.374
to kill everyone a minute ago?

49:05.643 --> 49:07.610
Why should he help Amy
what he didn't help them,

49:07.645 --> 49:11.317
or my parents,
wherever they are?

49:11.352 --> 49:13.319
Oh, I don't know.

49:13.354 --> 49:16.817
The Lord moves in
mysterious ways.

49:16.852 --> 49:19.424
Oh, yes, he does.

49:19.459 --> 49:28.202
He put a killer crocodile in
the middle of fucking Hampshire.

49:28.237 --> 49:30.171
It doesn't get much more
mysterious, does it?

49:30.206 --> 49:32.734
Charles, Amy is
in serious danger.

49:37.378 --> 49:39.510
This is where all that
yoga training pays off.

50:57.260 --> 51:00.723
You're safe now.

51:00.758 --> 51:03.165
Thank god.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.926
No, thank my dad.

51:05.961 --> 51:08.137
Did you see him?

51:08.172 --> 51:10.238
No, I just know that was him.

51:10.273 --> 51:11.305
Oh.

51:11.340 --> 51:12.471
The crocodile is
still out there.

51:12.506 --> 51:16.739
So what are we going to do?

51:16.774 --> 51:17.443
We wait.

51:23.913 --> 51:27.519
Well, I guess we know what
happened to Georgie then.

51:30.623 --> 51:33.756
I just wish she'd told someone
before she wandered off

51:33.791 --> 51:35.197
on her own.

51:35.232 --> 51:36.924
That doesn't seem like her.

51:39.929 --> 51:41.467
That will be my dad.

51:49.246 --> 51:53.182
Oh.

51:53.217 --> 51:53.875
Oh, my god.

51:53.910 --> 51:54.744
You're all right.

51:54.779 --> 51:55.844
Did he get you?

51:55.879 --> 51:57.615
I'm fine.

51:57.650 --> 52:00.684
Oh, god, we need to find my dad.

52:18.968 --> 52:21.639
We need to get you
some proper first aid.

52:21.674 --> 52:22.707
OK.

52:22.742 --> 52:25.346
There might be a first
aid kit in the pool house.

52:25.381 --> 52:26.677
OK, let's go.

52:26.712 --> 52:27.480
Come on.

52:45.269 --> 52:45.927
I've got this.

53:22.867 --> 53:23.833
It's not pretty.

53:26.409 --> 53:27.738
I'm sorry.

53:27.773 --> 53:31.071
I can't deal with her being
in the pool like that.

53:31.106 --> 53:32.512
We'll move her in a minute.

53:36.111 --> 53:37.044
Right.

53:37.079 --> 53:39.013
Let's see what we can do.

53:39.048 --> 53:43.391
You know, I've never seen
this side to you before.

53:43.426 --> 53:46.955
I thought you were just this
womanizing playboy guy who

53:46.990 --> 53:50.563
told women he saved
leopards for a living.

53:50.598 --> 53:53.830
But I don't think
that's the real you.

53:53.865 --> 53:57.537
After my wife died,
I was the real me.

54:00.003 --> 54:02.707
It is the real me.

54:02.742 --> 54:04.280
Maybe you're living in the past.

54:07.142 --> 54:07.811
Maybe.

54:10.552 --> 54:11.947
There, try that.

54:14.622 --> 54:17.084
You know, for someone
without a proper job,

54:17.119 --> 54:18.019
you're pretty useful.

54:23.631 --> 54:26.533
Maybe we need to work
on your flirting a bit.

54:34.807 --> 54:36.939
It's Lisa.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.138
Where?

54:38.173 --> 54:40.140
She's trying to send a message.

54:40.175 --> 54:40.844
Top window.

54:55.993 --> 54:57.696
Is that Morse code?

54:57.731 --> 55:00.028
Yeah, she remembers.

55:00.063 --> 55:01.568
Wow.

55:01.603 --> 55:03.537
What's she saying?

55:03.572 --> 55:05.473
Charlie's wounded.

55:05.508 --> 55:07.640
Are you OK?

55:07.675 --> 55:09.004
Thank god for text speak.

55:12.680 --> 55:14.174
Question for you, reverend.

55:14.209 --> 55:15.483
Yes.

55:15.518 --> 55:16.814
Being a man of the
cloth, why do you

55:16.849 --> 55:19.487
think God has done
something like this?

55:19.522 --> 55:22.985
If I say, he moves
in mysterious ways--

55:23.020 --> 55:24.525
Wouldn't cut it.

55:24.560 --> 55:27.088
Well, then I don't
know, I'm afraid.

55:27.123 --> 55:28.496
I'm stumped.

55:28.531 --> 55:30.597
You don't think it's
because we're all evil,

55:30.632 --> 55:32.126
we deserve to die?

55:32.161 --> 55:32.797
No.

55:32.832 --> 55:33.127
No.

55:33.162 --> 55:33.798
No.

55:33.833 --> 55:34.599
No.

55:34.634 --> 55:36.163
There's lots of
good people here.

55:36.198 --> 55:36.867
There were.

55:43.645 --> 55:47.141
You know, I do wonder.

55:47.176 --> 55:49.143
All these natural disasters--

55:49.178 --> 55:54.951
hurricanes, floods, fires--
people that survive,

55:54.986 --> 55:57.855
they often thank
God to be alive.

55:57.890 --> 56:00.627
But it's the ones that
die I think about.

56:00.662 --> 56:01.859
What did they do?

56:01.894 --> 56:04.092
If God sent the
hurricane and the floods,

56:04.127 --> 56:08.602
why did he let some people die
and some survive, you know?

56:08.637 --> 56:11.704
So what do you think
your purpose is here?

56:11.739 --> 56:13.607
Is this some kind of test?

56:13.642 --> 56:15.510
Or is it just a coincidence?

56:15.545 --> 56:18.645
I don't believe in
such thing as coincidences.

56:18.680 --> 56:21.549
You do think it
happened for a reason.

56:21.584 --> 56:23.144
Whatever reasons they may be.

56:23.179 --> 56:24.717
Who knows?

56:24.752 --> 56:27.819
Maybe this is your moment,
your martyr moment.

56:31.528 --> 56:34.595
Maybe you're the
one that's going

56:34.630 --> 56:37.191
to save us and deliver us.

56:37.226 --> 56:37.895
Maybe.

56:41.098 --> 56:42.064
Right.

56:42.099 --> 56:45.573
My dad is in the pool
house with Amy and V.

56:45.608 --> 56:47.234
The croc is doing
laps of this house.

56:47.269 --> 56:51.579
So we just need to time it right
so we can get them over here.

56:51.614 --> 56:53.075
Where do you want me?

56:53.110 --> 56:54.076
You stay here.

56:54.111 --> 56:56.749
You call to me as soon
as you see it coming.

56:56.784 --> 56:58.751
I'll signal to
them from upstairs.

56:58.786 --> 57:02.051
And then we just need
somebody by the back door.

57:02.086 --> 57:02.788
Allow me.

57:06.057 --> 57:06.693
OK.

57:16.837 --> 57:18.034
I'm not seeing it.

57:18.069 --> 57:19.706
It's going for the pool house.

57:29.718 --> 57:30.783
Wait.

57:30.818 --> 57:33.049
You don't think it's--

57:33.084 --> 57:35.282
Humans don't knock like that.

57:37.220 --> 57:41.123
I've never seen a croc
use the door handle yet.

57:43.094 --> 57:43.862
Shit.

57:43.897 --> 57:44.962
We need to distract it.

57:44.997 --> 57:46.502
We need to get it
away from there.

57:48.671 --> 57:51.265
Wait.

57:51.300 --> 57:54.136
Oh, my god.

57:54.171 --> 57:54.807
Hey!

57:54.842 --> 57:56.237
Hey, crocodile!

57:56.272 --> 57:57.645
Come and get me!

57:57.680 --> 57:59.273
The reverend is using
himself as a decoy.

57:59.308 --> 58:02.078
You tell me as soon
as the coast is clear.

58:02.113 --> 58:04.344
Over here!

58:04.379 --> 58:06.280
OK, get ready.

58:27.402 --> 58:28.269
Go.

58:28.304 --> 58:30.271
Come on.

58:47.730 --> 58:48.696
Hey.

58:48.731 --> 58:49.697
Hey.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.649
God does work in
mysterious ways.

59:14.449 --> 59:15.415
Easy.

59:15.450 --> 59:16.889
Easy.

59:16.924 --> 59:18.726
What's wrong?

59:18.761 --> 59:20.695
Just a bit of collateral damage.

59:20.730 --> 59:22.730
I'll be fine.

59:22.765 --> 59:25.425
Hey.

59:25.460 --> 59:28.703
So is this all of us?

59:28.738 --> 59:30.298
What are your thoughts?

59:30.333 --> 59:32.773
Why is this thing here?

59:32.808 --> 59:34.302
Did someone put it here?

59:34.337 --> 59:35.908
No.

59:35.943 --> 59:41.216
I found its nest, and
half a tent, and this.

59:44.952 --> 59:46.380
I don't know why it's here.

59:46.415 --> 59:48.217
I don't know how it survived.

59:48.252 --> 59:49.922
But that's why I
need to capture it.

59:49.957 --> 59:52.122
Capture it?

59:52.157 --> 59:52.859
Whoa.

59:52.894 --> 59:54.927
Like take it alive?

59:54.962 --> 59:57.094
Mate, I know you're all
for saving the wildlife.

59:57.129 --> 1:00:00.394
But that thing has killed dozens
of people, including my family.

1:00:00.429 --> 1:00:01.835
And it's trying to get us.

1:00:01.870 --> 1:00:04.673
Now, if it's easier to
kill it, I say, kill it.

1:00:04.708 --> 1:00:06.741
I agree.

1:00:06.776 --> 1:00:11.779
Dad, I know you want to save
it, but that thing is dangerous.

1:00:11.814 --> 1:00:12.780
You're already injured.

1:00:12.815 --> 1:00:14.144
Can we please just be sensible?

1:00:18.249 --> 1:00:22.482
If we can capture it, if it's
at all possible, let's do that.

1:00:22.517 --> 1:00:23.791
So now what?

1:00:23.826 --> 1:00:24.990
We stay put.

1:00:25.025 --> 1:00:27.355
We batten down the
hatches, keep it out.

1:00:27.390 --> 1:00:28.389
We've got food.

1:00:28.425 --> 1:00:30.831
We can survive until
someone comes to help us,

1:00:30.866 --> 1:00:33.801
or we can find some
opportunity to escape.

1:00:33.836 --> 1:00:37.838
In the meantime, we
shut and bolt the doors.

1:00:37.873 --> 1:00:38.839
We shut the windows.

1:00:38.874 --> 1:00:39.906
We double check them.

1:00:39.941 --> 1:00:41.402
And we make weapons--

1:00:41.437 --> 1:00:45.472
knives, sticks, boiling water,
whatever we can-- to hurt it,

1:00:45.507 --> 1:00:47.507
to slow it down, to trap it.

1:00:47.542 --> 1:00:49.410
We make this place a fortress.

1:00:53.856 --> 1:00:55.790
I don't see the point in this.

1:00:55.825 --> 1:00:57.022
It's a hotel.

1:00:57.057 --> 1:00:58.452
It's not like we're
going to find heavy duty

1:00:58.487 --> 1:01:01.928
rope or a tranquilizer gun.

1:01:01.963 --> 1:01:08.264
If you do find a tranquilizer
gun, use it on me.

1:01:08.299 --> 1:01:10.299
It's starting to sting a little.

1:01:32.587 --> 1:01:34.895
Nothing up there but a
load of old bed sheets.

1:01:34.930 --> 1:01:36.930
I only found a couple
of kitchen knives.

1:01:36.965 --> 1:01:40.428
I don't think anyone expected
this place to be under siege.

1:01:40.463 --> 1:01:42.738
I found a fire poker
and croquet mallets.

1:01:49.076 --> 1:01:51.043
What are these?

1:01:51.078 --> 1:01:52.308
They're clothes.

1:01:52.343 --> 1:01:55.443
They're your
clothes, aren't they?

1:01:55.478 --> 1:01:56.884
Uh--

1:01:56.919 --> 1:01:58.578
You were wearing
them last night.

1:01:58.613 --> 1:01:59.788
I remember.

1:01:59.823 --> 1:02:02.252
There are photos of us together.

1:02:02.287 --> 1:02:05.123
So what were they doing
stashed downstairs?

1:02:05.158 --> 1:02:09.061
I went on a walk last night
after everyone had gone to bed.

1:02:09.096 --> 1:02:12.229
And I was a little drunk.

1:02:12.264 --> 1:02:14.000
I couldn't see
where I was going.

1:02:14.035 --> 1:02:17.531
And I walked face
first into the pond.

1:02:17.566 --> 1:02:20.105
When I got back, I
threw them down there,

1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:22.437
because I didn't want anyone
to see me soaking wet.

1:02:26.883 --> 1:02:30.544
I cut myself when
I was in the pond.

1:02:30.579 --> 1:02:34.383
They've got to have a sign,
or a fence, or something.

1:02:34.418 --> 1:02:34.955
It's insane.

1:02:34.990 --> 1:02:36.957
Bullshit.

1:02:36.992 --> 1:02:38.585
You were Georgie, weren't you?

1:02:38.620 --> 1:02:40.026
No.

1:02:40.061 --> 1:02:41.863
Don't lie to me.

1:02:41.898 --> 1:02:42.897
I know you were with her.

1:02:42.932 --> 1:02:44.228
Just tell me the truth.

1:02:44.263 --> 1:02:47.935
I know you've always
had a thing for her.

1:02:47.970 --> 1:02:50.102
OK, we went on
the walk together.

1:02:50.137 --> 1:02:52.368
But that's all that happened.

1:02:52.403 --> 1:02:53.369
I swear.

1:02:53.404 --> 1:02:58.539
The crocodile attacked
her, and I freaked out.

1:02:58.574 --> 1:03:01.641
You fucking liar.

1:03:01.676 --> 1:03:03.280
Do you know how I know?

1:03:03.315 --> 1:03:06.514
Because I've told
plenty of lies.

1:03:06.549 --> 1:03:09.583
I should drag you out there,
feed you to the fucking crocs.

1:03:09.618 --> 1:03:11.959
Dad, stop, please.

1:03:11.994 --> 1:03:13.290
Tell me why I shouldn't.

1:03:13.325 --> 1:03:16.865
Punishment usually
needs to fit the crime.

1:03:16.900 --> 1:03:17.624
Oh, it does.

1:03:17.659 --> 1:03:20.066
Stop.

1:03:20.101 --> 1:03:21.903
Enough people have died today.

1:03:21.938 --> 1:03:23.399
We don't need to
go there, no matter

1:03:23.434 --> 1:03:27.172
how much you think .

1:03:27.207 --> 1:03:28.041
I'm so sorry.

1:03:28.076 --> 1:03:30.472
It meant nothing.

1:03:30.507 --> 1:03:33.475
God, what an excuse.

1:03:33.510 --> 1:03:38.084
So when you proposed to
me, did that mean nothing?

1:03:38.119 --> 1:03:40.020
Or our wedding vows,
if we had got that far,

1:03:40.055 --> 1:03:42.550
would they have meant nothing?

1:03:42.585 --> 1:03:46.488
I'm so done with you.

1:03:46.523 --> 1:03:47.192
Asshole.

1:03:55.070 --> 1:03:57.103
I'll be right back.

1:03:57.138 --> 1:04:01.008
You, don't say a word.

1:04:01.043 --> 1:04:04.341
And you, give me that.

1:04:14.089 --> 1:04:19.026
My life is a mess, Amy.

1:04:19.061 --> 1:04:20.357
God, it's a disaster.

1:04:23.032 --> 1:04:26.231
I have a pointless
job that serves

1:04:26.266 --> 1:04:30.004
no real purpose, something
my dad likes to remind me

1:04:30.039 --> 1:04:33.370
of every time he sees me.

1:04:33.405 --> 1:04:37.539
My wedding day has gone
from shit to worse.

1:04:37.574 --> 1:04:39.607
And I just found
out that my fiancee

1:04:39.642 --> 1:04:45.217
has been shagging one of
my friends, my friend who

1:04:45.252 --> 1:04:46.317
is now dead.

1:04:49.586 --> 1:04:53.423
And to top it off, we
are still being hunted

1:04:53.458 --> 1:04:55.656
by the crocodile from hell.

1:04:58.430 --> 1:04:59.693
I'm not going to lie--

1:04:59.728 --> 1:05:03.972
you're not living your
best life right now.

1:05:04.007 --> 1:05:06.436
But your job isn't pointless.

1:05:06.471 --> 1:05:09.637
Millions of people
appreciate what you do.

1:05:09.672 --> 1:05:13.509
And as for Charlie, it's a
good job you found out now.

1:05:13.544 --> 1:05:15.412
Imagine if you'd married him.

1:05:15.447 --> 1:05:18.184
Once a cheat, always a cheat.

1:05:18.219 --> 1:05:20.318
True.

1:05:20.353 --> 1:05:22.122
We're going to avenge
your friend's death

1:05:22.157 --> 1:05:24.586
and kill that damn crocodile.

1:05:24.621 --> 1:05:25.994
Yeah.

1:05:26.029 --> 1:05:27.259
Good.

1:05:27.294 --> 1:05:29.195
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

1:05:29.230 --> 1:05:32.330
Yeah, make me a sandwich.

1:05:32.365 --> 1:05:33.628
I'm fucking starving.

1:06:07.466 --> 1:06:11.765
So what, we just wait
until someone finds us?

1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:14.240
I guess so.

1:06:14.275 --> 1:06:17.144
It could take ages.

1:06:17.179 --> 1:06:18.475
I know.

1:06:18.510 --> 1:06:20.675
And we don't even have
the Wi-Fi to entertain us.

1:06:25.121 --> 1:06:27.715
Oh, guess I'll
make a ..

1:06:27.750 --> 1:06:29.222
Good idea.

1:06:29.257 --> 1:06:30.685
I'll see if anyone
else wants one.

1:06:55.118 --> 1:06:56.513
It's in the house!

1:06:56.548 --> 1:06:58.449
The crocodile's in the house!

1:07:01.685 --> 1:07:03.388
It's inside.

1:07:03.423 --> 1:07:04.191
It's down there.

1:07:06.393 --> 1:07:08.393
It can't climb stairs, can it?

1:07:08.428 --> 1:07:09.889
It'll figure them out.

1:07:09.924 --> 1:07:11.660
We need to block the stairs.

1:07:41.428 --> 1:07:43.857
Oh, fuck sake.

1:07:45.564 --> 1:07:45.892
OK.

1:07:46.895 --> 1:07:47.531
Well--

1:07:47.566 --> 1:07:47.894
OK.

1:07:50.701 --> 1:07:54.307
--that should stop it for now.

1:07:54.342 --> 1:07:56.210
Lisa, are you OK?

1:07:56.245 --> 1:07:58.674
Yeah, we're all right.

1:07:58.709 --> 1:08:01.149
I'm not sure I trust
this door, though.

1:08:01.184 --> 1:08:01.875
Stay there.

1:08:01.910 --> 1:08:03.316
I'll figure it out.

1:08:07.190 --> 1:08:08.255
You guys OK?

1:08:08.290 --> 1:08:09.751
Yeah.

1:08:09.786 --> 1:08:10.452
What now?

1:08:10.487 --> 1:08:13.359
I have a revolver in the car.

1:08:13.394 --> 1:08:15.889
You've had a gun
this whole time?

1:08:15.924 --> 1:08:17.891
I keep it for emergencies.

1:08:17.926 --> 1:08:21.862
And it's only just now
become an emergency?

1:08:21.897 --> 1:08:23.633
Yeah, there's one problem.

1:08:23.668 --> 1:08:25.668
The keys are on the
stand next to my coat.

1:08:43.490 --> 1:08:44.984
That's the end of it.

1:08:45.019 --> 1:08:45.688
Yeah.

1:08:54.369 --> 1:08:55.533
Come on then.

1:09:00.639 --> 1:09:02.001
Where the fuck's the croc?

1:09:02.036 --> 1:09:03.211
I don't know.

1:09:08.977 --> 1:09:13.650
We got them!

1:09:16.688 --> 1:09:17.918
I'm going out the window.

1:09:24.729 --> 1:09:25.464
Good luck.

1:10:31.895 --> 1:10:33.466
Cock it.

1:10:33.501 --> 1:10:34.060
Undo safety.

1:11:50.677 --> 1:11:54.074
Dylan, kill this thing now!

1:12:00.016 --> 1:12:03.622
Dad, what was that?

1:12:06.154 --> 1:12:11.498
That .

1:12:11.533 --> 1:12:15.733
Now, listen, it's
up to you to now.

1:12:15.768 --> 1:12:18.571
You're going to have to
work out how to kill it.

1:12:18.606 --> 1:12:22.168
Remember everything
I've taught you.

1:12:22.203 --> 1:12:24.203
Use your initiative.

1:12:24.238 --> 1:12:26.513
I know you can do it.

1:12:26.548 --> 1:12:27.041
OK.

1:12:37.053 --> 1:12:38.525
All right, think.

1:12:38.560 --> 1:12:39.185
Think.

1:12:39.220 --> 1:12:39.988
What do we have?

1:12:40.023 --> 1:12:43.431
What can we use?

1:12:43.466 --> 1:12:45.730
You lure it in.

1:12:45.765 --> 1:12:49.437
I'll cave it's
head in with this.

1:12:49.472 --> 1:12:50.966
You're on your own there.

1:12:51.001 --> 1:12:51.900
No.

1:12:51.936 --> 1:12:54.134
No, I think we need
less direct methods.

1:13:04.553 --> 1:13:06.179
Glass will slow it down.

1:13:06.214 --> 1:13:09.017
Yeah, but then what?

1:13:16.763 --> 1:13:19.258
We set fire to it.

1:13:19.293 --> 1:13:21.865
I like the way you think.

1:13:21.900 --> 1:13:24.868
And we have flares.

1:13:24.903 --> 1:13:29.807
So we take the flares, and we
guide it to an outbuilding,

1:13:29.842 --> 1:13:32.744
and shut the door,
and set fire to it.

1:13:32.779 --> 1:13:34.680
We could use the pool house.

1:13:34.715 --> 1:13:36.880
We could drop it in the pool.

1:13:36.915 --> 1:13:37.447
No.

1:13:37.482 --> 1:13:39.080
No, it'd just climb out.

1:13:39.115 --> 1:13:40.114
Well, can we drain it?

1:13:45.924 --> 1:13:47.055
Maybe we don't have to.

1:13:57.573 --> 1:13:59.265
What's that?

1:13:59.300 --> 1:14:02.774
It's venison from Neil's farm.

1:14:02.809 --> 1:14:05.843
It's supposed to be for dinner.

1:14:05.878 --> 1:14:08.241
Well, don't fuck this up.

1:14:08.276 --> 1:14:10.815
I mean, shame to waste it.

1:14:25.095 --> 1:14:26.094
Make her proud.

1:16:11.465 --> 1:16:13.102
Come on.

1:16:13.137 --> 1:16:13.806
Come on.

1:16:23.081 --> 1:16:24.278
Guide it in the pool.

1:16:31.254 --> 1:16:33.694
Over here!

1:16:38.701 --> 1:16:41.196
Come on!

1:16:49.976 --> 1:16:52.108
I'm in the .

1:16:58.479 --> 1:16:59.445
Go.

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:00.446
Go.

1:17:00.481 --> 1:17:01.150
Go.

1:17:05.123 --> 1:17:06.419
Go!

1:17:06.454 --> 1:17:07.123
Go!

1:17:48.870 --> 1:17:50.463
It's .

1:17:59.474 --> 1:18:00.880
You're late.

1:18:00.915 --> 1:18:02.145
What can I say?

1:18:02.180 --> 1:18:03.509
You two make a great team.

1:18:06.987 --> 1:18:08.382
Thank fuck for that.

1:18:17.327 --> 1:18:18.964
We need to get
you to a hospital.

1:18:18.999 --> 1:18:21.164
A hospital?

1:18:21.199 --> 1:18:22.398
Yes.

1:18:22.434 --> 1:18:25.806
Your leg's about to drop off,
and I want you in one piece.

1:18:25.841 --> 1:18:27.874
You want me in one piece?

1:18:27.909 --> 1:18:29.238
Please may I have?

1:18:40.086 --> 1:18:42.581
You all right?

1:18:42.616 --> 1:18:43.285
Don't even.

1:18:46.829 --> 1:18:48.862
I'm sorry, darling.

1:18:48.897 --> 1:18:50.226
Look at it this way--

1:18:50.261 --> 1:18:52.525
your honeymoon
can't be any worse.
