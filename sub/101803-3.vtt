00:07.507 --> 00:09.592
Previously on SEAL Team...

00:07.507 --> 00:09.592
BROCK:
Look who's back!

00:09.676 --> 00:10.760
SONNY:
Oh, yeah!

00:10.844 --> 00:11.761
RAY:
His three years in is like

00:11.845 --> 00:12.762
21 for any of us.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.639
I think it's time for
him to just be a dog.

00:14.723 --> 00:15.765
We made a commitment
to serve.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.142
It's not who
I want to be.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.601
If I don't walk away now,

00:18.685 --> 00:20.270
I'm gonna lose
myself forever.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.270
Okay, just...

00:20.353 --> 00:22.605
ERIC:
No one needs to talk to NCIS.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.482
The offender has come forward.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.482
Wait, what?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.276
You wrote the letter?

00:24.566 --> 00:26.276
RAY:
You are doing the wrong thing

00:26.359 --> 00:28.194
by trying to take the rap
for me. What about your future?

00:28.278 --> 00:29.237
LINDELL:
Goes without saying,

00:29.320 --> 00:31.281
STA-21 is gone.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.449
RAY:
Command's on Bravo's ass

00:32.532 --> 00:33.450
over some nonsense.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.326
It could jeopardize my promotion
if it blows up.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.786
Let's hope it blows over.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.580
War has been my refuge
for too long.

00:38.663 --> 00:41.332
It's time for Bravo 1 to take
a step back from operating.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.462
(indistinct radio transmission)
Roger that. Ready to send...

00:45.545 --> 00:46.463
Get ready!

00:46.546 --> 00:49.090
ALL (overlapping):
One minute!

00:49.174 --> 00:51.426
(indistinct radio chatter)

00:54.220 --> 00:56.931
(whirring)

00:58.850 --> 01:00.185
30 seconds!

01:00.268 --> 01:03.021
ALL (overlapping):
30 seconds!

01:38.056 --> 01:40.058
(wind blowing)

01:43.311 --> 01:44.479
Bravo have boots
on the ground yet?

01:44.562 --> 01:47.232
Boots are on the ground. They're
just not in the right spot.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.984
They overshot the landing area
by two klicks east.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.362
Alpha and Charlie Teams
miss the "X," too?

01:52.445 --> 01:54.864
They dead-eyed the LZ
and are headed to target now.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.366
Boys don't hurry up,
they won't have a chair

01:56.449 --> 01:58.034
when the music stops.

01:58.117 --> 02:00.119
♪ ♪

02:21.474 --> 02:23.393
Gotta back around.

02:27.814 --> 02:30.358
Where are we
going, Sonny?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.277
All stop! All stop!

02:32.360 --> 02:34.696
All stop!

02:32.360 --> 02:34.696
Come on now, Texas.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.489
I didn't get all pretty
just to miss the ball.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.242
Gonna turn into
pumpkins soon.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.369
Our fearless leader's
got us way off course.

02:41.452 --> 02:42.704
Bravo 1, this is 3!

02:42.787 --> 02:44.622
I think you got us going
in the wrong direction.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.375
THIRTY MIKE:
3,

02:47.458 --> 02:48.668
this is Bravo 1.

02:48.751 --> 02:49.919
Work the problem.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.755
You got us so turned around,
we can't work the damn problem.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.757
We missed our landing zone
by two klicks.

02:54.841 --> 02:55.967
Wind data was off.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.386
Nobody warned us
about the crosswind at 10,000.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.054
Yeah. Thirty's right, man.

03:00.138 --> 03:01.264
I reconfirmed
the jump path.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.558
Somebody else goofed.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.558
Yeah, somebody
goofed all right:

03:03.641 --> 03:06.269
whoever made Thirty Bravo 1.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.024
(indistinct radio transmission)

03:15.236 --> 03:17.614
Let me know when Echo Team's
Charlie Mike.

03:21.701 --> 03:22.952
How are the boys doing?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.287
More of the same.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.289
Missed the landing zone,
losing pace.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.124
Good thing it's
just a training op.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.127
Been saying that for two months
since you stepped down.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.254
Hopefully this isn't
Bravo's new normal.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.840
Gonna take some time,
but they'll adjust

03:35.924 --> 03:37.133
and get it all
squared away.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.593
Moving from the battlefield
with the boys

03:38.676 --> 03:40.011
to the sidelines as ops chief

03:40.094 --> 03:41.429
must take
some adjusting, too.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.389
Not at all. Just staying
in my three-foot world.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.773
This route.
Has more elevation change

03:51.856 --> 03:53.107
but saves time.

03:51.856 --> 03:53.107
Maybe.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.067
But we don't know the terrain
up there.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.944
We could get bogged down.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.944
It's not a debate.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.987
Mount up!

03:58.071 --> 03:59.530
Come on, Pep.
Let's go.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.949
(whistles)

04:01.032 --> 04:03.660
ERIC:
All right, end ex. End ex.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.245
Alpha and Charlie Teams
just passed jackpot.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.461
We'll get 'em
next time, boys.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.461
You know, Thirty,

04:13.544 --> 04:15.797
the key point of
"time on target"

04:15.880 --> 04:18.174
is actually making it
to the damn target!

04:20.927 --> 04:23.554
Another rough outing for Bravo,
Lieutenant Commander Blackburn.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.014
Seems we got
some bad information

04:25.098 --> 04:26.516
on the wind data, sir.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.017
Might do the team some good,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.852
knock some of that
swagger out of 'em.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.521
Not sure how much swagger
they're gonna have left

04:31.604 --> 04:32.855
after all these misfires.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.065
JASON:
Bravo's gonna be fine

04:34.148 --> 04:35.692
once Clay and Ray
are back on the team.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.318
Seems you manage to end up

04:37.402 --> 04:38.945
in the ops center
whenever Bravo heads out

04:39.028 --> 04:40.655
on another training mission,
Master Chief.

04:40.738 --> 04:42.198
Ops is my new battlefield, sir.

04:42.281 --> 04:45.201
Echo Team has
an air asset issue in Yemen

04:45.284 --> 04:46.577
that I need you
to solve.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.371
Yes, sir.

04:48.454 --> 04:51.207
Just be sure that Echo is
the team you're focused on.

04:51.290 --> 04:52.500
Roger that.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.711
Bravo's in my rearview.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.756
♪ ♪

05:08.349 --> 05:09.559
JASON:
Look at you.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.061
Two months ago, you took out
the biggest HVT in Afghanistan.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.063
Now you're flying solo
behind a desk.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.566
That's what you call
pipehitter purgatory.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.901
I would take making
sugar cookies in BUD/S

05:18.985 --> 05:20.945
over proofreading these
reports any day of the week.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.572
Well, Lindell
sure did put

05:22.655 --> 05:24.949
his golden boy down for writing
that letter to Marsden.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.076
How much more time you have left
on your sentence?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.953
No idea.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.371
(scoffs)

05:30.455 --> 05:33.082
I'm pushing paper
and you're operating a radio.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.044
It's a pretty sorry end
for a couple of gunslingers.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.712
I think we both made
the right call.

05:39.338 --> 05:40.590
How'd the boys do?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.761
The boys...
(exhales)

05:44.844 --> 05:46.929
crapped the bed again.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.929
(chuckles):
Oh, man.

05:47.013 --> 05:50.266
I never thought I'd see
Bravo lose its fangs.

05:50.349 --> 05:53.478
I'd give anything to be out
there with them right now.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.193
You know, I'm, uh...

06:00.276 --> 06:01.944
I'm gonna go clear my head
at the range,

06:02.028 --> 06:04.072
if you're up
for a little-little competition.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.199
No, I haven't shot a round
since I stopped operating.

06:06.282 --> 06:08.076
Well, that's okay.
You know, you...

06:08.159 --> 06:09.911
you never could beat me anyway,
so...

06:09.994 --> 06:11.913
(chuckles) It's gonna take more
than the little baby-faced

06:11.996 --> 06:13.081
trash talking
you're doing right now

06:13.164 --> 06:14.624
to bring me out of retirement.

06:14.707 --> 06:16.834
It ain't gonna happen.
Oh, just for the record,

06:16.918 --> 06:19.170
I always ate your lunch
at the range.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.050
Oh, wait a second.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.636
Ray Perry, back
from warrant officer school.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.387
Look at that fruit salad
on you.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.472
(both laugh)

06:29.555 --> 06:30.973
You look good, man.

06:29.555 --> 06:30.973
Yeah, yeah.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.643
I'm, uh, still a sled dog.
Don't you forget it.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.520
I tell you, all that time off
in Rhode Island,

06:35.603 --> 06:37.146
it served you well.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.108
I wouldn't classify
it as a vacation.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.108
Yeah.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.151
You're looking better
than expected, too.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.486
Meaning what?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.155
Even the most hard-charging
operator puts on

06:46.239 --> 06:48.157
the post-frogman 15
when they slow down.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.618
Nah, I'm good. I'm not slowing
down, just pushing ahead.

06:51.494 --> 06:54.497
Just saying,
not operating with Bravo,

06:54.580 --> 06:55.998
moving into ops chief,

06:56.082 --> 06:57.375
I wouldn't fault you
for struggling.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.835
I'm squared away.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.711
It's your current teammates
who are struggling.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.213
Yeah.
(exhales)

07:02.296 --> 07:03.840
Heard they were backsliding.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.883
Yeah.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.883
Maybe they need
their old Bravo 1

07:05.967 --> 07:07.135
to coach 'em up like old times?

07:07.218 --> 07:09.011
No, that's for you
to get 'em back on track.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.346
I'm done.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.348
Go get 'em, Ray.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.061
All right. (grunts)

07:18.437 --> 07:20.273
(beeping)

07:22.275 --> 07:24.026
Julian Blondesange.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.154
Who you come to blow
the whistle on this time?

07:26.237 --> 07:28.030
Just going to the range.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.907
Why you need trigger
time, Spenser?

07:29.991 --> 07:32.201
Only weapon you use these days
is a pencil.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.995
Oh, look at that.
Thirty's just bitter

07:34.078 --> 07:36.205
because you bagged
Al-Hazred before he did.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.875
So I guess that's why they
call you Thirty Mike, huh?

07:38.958 --> 07:40.543
That's how long it takes you
to squeeze a shot off?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.211
Witness to
history again.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.046
Forrest Gump of operators.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.756
(Clay and Sonny chuckle)

07:45.840 --> 07:47.216
At least he's operating.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.011
Hey, buddy. Pepper's excited
to roll with you

07:50.094 --> 07:51.888
when you're back.
Come say hi.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.681
Hey.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.681
SONNY:
Come on, man. It's bad
enough that we can't walk

07:53.764 --> 07:55.558
and shoot at
the same time.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.144
But to go from Cerberus
to Pepper? Seriously?

07:58.227 --> 08:00.438
I think part of the reason
the team's got some bad mojo

08:00.521 --> 08:02.440
right now is
that the dog's name is soft.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.900
(Pepper growls)

08:03.983 --> 08:05.067
I knew you were
attached to Jason,

08:05.151 --> 08:05.943
but Cerberus, too?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.904
Really?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.904
CLAY:
Hey, I think, uh...

08:07.987 --> 08:10.907
I think now is a good time
to remind yourselves that...

08:10.990 --> 08:13.159
that Thirty here
is just the interim Bravo 1

08:13.242 --> 08:15.077
till Command finds
a replacement for Jason.

08:15.161 --> 08:18.581
Hey, it's a temporary title
for a permanent jagoff.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.292
(laughter)

08:18.664 --> 08:21.292
(door opens)

08:21.375 --> 08:23.544
Warrant Officer Perry on deck!

08:21.375 --> 08:23.544
Hey, hey!

08:23.628 --> 08:25.087
SONNY (chuckles):
Hey! Look at this guy.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.090
Looking good, buddy.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.090
What's going on?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.092
Be lucky to get half
this attention when I get home

08:30.176 --> 08:31.260
to my wife and kids.
Sup, brother?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.136
SONNY:
Well, if Naima's

08:32.220 --> 08:33.304
been shacking up
with Thirty, you will.

08:33.387 --> 08:36.807
Hey, could happen. Naima sparked
to me the night they met.

08:36.891 --> 08:38.768
Ain't that right,
Prime Time?

08:36.891 --> 08:38.768
Ooh.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.144
You know what?

08:41.687 --> 08:43.773
Not even you can bring me down
right now, Thirty.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.149
SONNY:
Gonna welcome

08:45.233 --> 08:47.151
Ray home in style
tonight, boys.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.152
First round

08:48.236 --> 08:49.195
is on the newest cake-eater.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.113
Y'all are gonna eat up
my warrant officer pay bump

08:51.197 --> 08:52.448
in one night, aren't you?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.448
(chuckles): Yeah.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.116
And then,
for abstaining

08:54.200 --> 08:56.118
for two months
from extracurriculars,

08:56.202 --> 08:58.079
this cute little
Clay pigeon here

08:58.162 --> 09:01.165
is gonna transform
into a fierce nighthawk.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.334
(laughter)

09:01.249 --> 09:03.334
Agoraphobia flaring up
again there, Spenser?

09:03.417 --> 09:06.128
Just walking the line till
Lindell lets me off probation.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.797
Bro, you don't show up
at the Bulkhead,

09:07.880 --> 09:09.465
I'm pulling your Team Guy card.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.717
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
I still have it.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.803
All right, I'm in.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.639
(cheering)

09:13.886 --> 09:16.639
There he is.
He's in.

09:16.722 --> 09:19.642
Gentlemen, we have some
business to deal with.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.644
We are...

09:21.727 --> 09:23.020
spinning up?

09:23.104 --> 09:24.981
Not anytime soon.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.983
Captain Lindell
has determined that,

09:27.066 --> 09:29.568
until you show
vast improvement,

09:29.652 --> 09:31.445
Bravo's unfit to operate.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.784
♪ ♪

09:59.390 --> 10:01.392
(birds chirping)

10:06.105 --> 10:08.024
Is this, uh, the
Perry household?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.067
JAMEELAH:
Daddy!

10:08.107 --> 10:10.067
(chuckles)

10:10.151 --> 10:11.861
There's my baby girl.
Come here.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.322
(grunting)

10:14.405 --> 10:17.450
Every time I leave, you are
twice as big when I get back.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.535
Then maybe you should stop
leaving.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.786
Oh.

10:19.618 --> 10:20.786
Ah.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.872
She's been waiting two months
to hit you with that.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.872
Mmm.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.249
Mmm.

10:25.333 --> 10:26.834
(grunting)

10:26.917 --> 10:29.211
Babe, the house is looking good.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.172
It's looking really good.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.591
Well, still have those projects
for you to work on.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.884
Don't you worry.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.010
Oh. Well, great.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.763
I actually got time to start
earning my keep around here

10:38.846 --> 10:40.765
with Bravo still in
the training cycle.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.725
What's a training cycle?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.727
Uh, that's when
Bravo stays home,

10:44.810 --> 10:46.562
and I get to tuck
my babies in every night.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.522
I don't need tucking in anymore.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.857
(quietly):
Mm.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.068
You are growing up too fast,
Jameelah June.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.277
(laughs)

10:52.151 --> 10:53.277
NAIMA:
Well, sounds like

10:53.361 --> 10:54.570
you two can make
up for lost time.

10:55.154 --> 10:58.240
Absolutely,
but starting tomorrow?

10:58.324 --> 11:01.952
Um, Bravo's throwing me a
welcome home party tonight.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.662
If that's okay
with you two?

11:06.457 --> 11:11.295
Bravo can have you tonight, but
after that, you are all ours.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.588
Right?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.507
Yes, ma'am. Mwah.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.507
Mwah.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.677
Ah.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.682
(sighs)

11:41.450 --> 11:44.161
If you're conducting a séance,
I can come back.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.414
No, I'm just enjoying
the peace and quiet.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.416
That's it. (laughs)

11:46.497 --> 11:48.416
Mm.

11:48.499 --> 11:52.002
Staying calm in the calm
is a good look on you.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.422
Though I should warn you,

11:54.505 --> 11:56.590
things might get
just a little bit loud later.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.967
Thank you. I can handle that.

11:56.674 --> 11:57.967
Mm?

11:58.050 --> 11:58.717
How was work?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.803
Yeah, work was work.
By the way,

12:00.886 --> 12:01.846
you missing someone?

12:01.929 --> 12:04.640
Someone lagged behind
the entire hike.

12:04.723 --> 12:05.808
Come on!

12:05.891 --> 12:07.601
Where are you, buddy? Hey.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.353
How are you? Hey, buddy.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.688
(speaking gibberish)
Ah, yeah.

12:10.771 --> 12:12.356
Look at you.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.316
A couple of old,
smelly warriors.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.153
Ah, more like soul mates,
that's for sure.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.322
I talked to Emma on my hike.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.324
Oh, I was just about
to FaceTime her.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.659
She won't pick up.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.162
She's on her way
down to Baltimore.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.289
Oh, Baltimore.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.168
Gonna spend the whole weekend
with that kid's family?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.003
That kid has a name.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.422
Brad.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.422
Brad has got
to know that

12:36.505 --> 12:39.508
even though I'm not operating,
I'm very dangerous.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.343
You used that line on me
last time we went bowling,

12:41.427 --> 12:42.970
and I beat you by 40.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.638
40? How about that.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.515
(clears throat)
Hey, hey.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.351
(phone buzzing)

12:46.599 --> 12:49.351
(Jason groans)

12:49.435 --> 12:50.561
It's nice knowing
when that phone buzzes,

12:50.644 --> 12:52.688
you're not running
into bullets anymore.

12:52.771 --> 12:55.232
They're just throwing a bash
for Ray at the Bulkhead.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.734
It's a welcome home party.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.068
You should go.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.528
Thought we were
gonna have dinner.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.198
You've barely hung with the guys
since you quit Bravo.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.492
Besides, I should focus
on my report.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.952
You know, my days of
closing out the Bulkhead are...

13:07.036 --> 13:08.496
They're way over.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.498
Ray's promotion is a big deal.

13:10.581 --> 13:12.374
You should be there for him.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.918
(Jason slaps leg)

13:14.001 --> 13:15.544
What do you think?

13:14.001 --> 13:15.544
(laughs softly)

13:15.628 --> 13:17.630
Should I go?
Should I go?

13:17.713 --> 13:19.215
(Cerberus barks)

13:17.713 --> 13:19.215
Oh, yes.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.424
Won't be long, okay?

13:20.508 --> 13:21.425
All right.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.927
Come on, Cerberus.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.516
RAY:
How's life

13:28.599 --> 13:30.559
as a Navy bureaucrat, Spenser?

13:30.643 --> 13:33.312
Oh, man. Well,
let's see.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.398
Today, I, uh, proofread a paper
on DEVGRU's financial reporting.

13:36.482 --> 13:37.566
(imitates retching)

13:37.650 --> 13:40.653
A report on a report.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.653
SONNY (laughing):
Tell me those

13:40.736 --> 13:42.363
cake-eating demons
aren't still inside you

13:42.446 --> 13:44.198
after all this,
Blonde Rumsfeld.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.741
No, no, no.
Trust me, man, they've been...

13:45.824 --> 13:47.243
they've been exorcised.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.246
Lord, it's a miracle!
Let's do some shots.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.747
Can I get a "Amen"?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.082
Amen.

13:53.165 --> 13:55.209
Let's get some spirit
juice in us, boys.

13:55.292 --> 13:57.628
You know what? I think I'm
starting to see Bravo's problem.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.837
SONNY:
Oh, come on, man.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.549
Howling at the moon ain't got
nothing to do with this, okay?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.968
The issue with us
starts at the top.

14:04.051 --> 14:07.304
One man can't
bring down the team, Sonny.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.639
SONNY:
I tell you what.

14:08.722 --> 14:11.809
Thirty-- he ain't making Bravo
great again.

14:11.892 --> 14:14.270
The team just ain't right
without Jace.

14:14.353 --> 14:17.439
Well, that's because y'all are
refusing to move on without him.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.775
I mean, the dude's showing up
to the ops center every day,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.610
letting Bravo find
their sea legs on their own.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.572
I would say that he seems
committed to his next chapter.

14:24.655 --> 14:27.616
Hey, man, guy got off
the speeding train

14:27.700 --> 14:28.951
with mind and body intact.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.786
It's more than any
operator can ask for.

14:30.869 --> 14:31.829
RAY:
Damn straight.

14:30.869 --> 14:31.829
(clears throat)

14:31.912 --> 14:33.706
It's on us
to support the decision.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.711
All right.
It's just, you know...

14:39.628 --> 14:42.423
He won't go to the range,
barely hangs out with us,

14:42.506 --> 14:43.799
can't even set foot
in the cages.

14:43.882 --> 14:45.301
That's 'cause he moved on,
Sonny.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.802
Jason can compartmentalize
better

14:46.885 --> 14:47.928
than all of us, we know that.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.264
Okay, but what he's trying
to do right now is ignore

14:50.347 --> 14:52.433
and override anything
that reminds him

14:52.516 --> 14:56.478
of door-kicking because
every fiber of his being

14:56.562 --> 14:58.314
wants to get froggy again.

14:59.189 --> 15:03.193
♪ Let the spirit pull me under
to the bottom of the well ♪

15:03.277 --> 15:07.156

♪ So one for the money... ♪

15:12.620 --> 15:14.330
Playing desk jockey

15:14.413 --> 15:16.540
from the team's
driving me crazy.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.417
I'm-I'm sure
there's part of him

15:18.500 --> 15:20.336
that's questioning the path
he's chosen.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.630
That mean you're questioning
giving up life as an admiral?

15:23.631 --> 15:26.300
I got no regrets.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.302
Door-kicking's all I want to do.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.055
Damn. You haven't kicked
any damn doors in months.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.517
I'll tell you,
I messed up writing that letter.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.519
No.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.563
Marsden's family knows
the truth thanks to you.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.650
Yeah, but you're the
one paying for it.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.692
I made warrant officer,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.027
and-and... and you had all
your ambitions squashed.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.863
Look, man...

15:47.946 --> 15:51.367
the only ambition I have now
is make it back to Bravo.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.498
Aw! Gotcha.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.498
Oh. (laughs)

15:57.581 --> 15:59.166
Ooh, thank you.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.877
I'm gonna consider this a
down payment for all the matches

16:01.960 --> 16:04.505
that you've lost to me
the last couple months.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.505
Come on.

16:04.588 --> 16:08.133
I do recall the matches going
a completely different way.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.260
Yeah, and that spotty memory
of yours is what keeps you

16:10.344 --> 16:12.680
coming back for more beatings.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.680
Wow.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.224
Mm-hmm.

16:12.763 --> 16:15.224
Okay.

16:15.307 --> 16:17.518
You know, you know what?
It is, uh...

16:17.601 --> 16:21.230
It's really nice having you
hanging around the boys again,

16:21.313 --> 16:23.273
even if, uh, it is costing
me a fortune in drinks.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
(laughs)

16:23.357 --> 16:25.109
Yeah.

16:25.192 --> 16:28.070
Well, I'm trying to be mindful
of my work-life balance.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.572
Mandy walking away was
a real eye-opener.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.409
Well, you know, with everything
that's going on with Bravo...

16:34.993 --> 16:37.996
Kind of itching to get out
of here, you know,

16:38.080 --> 16:39.915
to get out of Vah Beach.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.915
Mm-hmm.

16:39.998 --> 16:43.252
And, uh, well, uh, NASCAR
happens to be this weekend

16:43.335 --> 16:46.422
down in Charlotte, and
my good buddy Austin Dillon...

16:46.505 --> 16:49.466
Oh, yes.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.466
Yeah, he invited me down
to come see him, and...

16:49.550 --> 16:51.552
and I thought maybe, you know,
well, I don't know,

16:51.635 --> 16:53.512
you might want to join me.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.097
Mm...

16:55.180 --> 16:56.432
(both laughing)

16:56.515 --> 16:58.100
That's-that's a terrible idea,
isn't it?

16:58.183 --> 17:00.060
Yes, it is.
Yeah, I knew it. I knew it.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.812
'Cause once you go down
that road, we're gonna get...

17:01.895 --> 17:03.939
We'd be right
in that red asphalt.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.065
Look, I don't know.
I mean, what,

17:05.149 --> 17:07.609
we got two friends hanging out.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.738
Two friends.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.738
What's the big deal?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.115
What's the big deal?

17:14.742 --> 17:17.035
♪ You've see the signs... ♪

17:17.119 --> 17:19.913
So, Jameelah's got every
free minute planned out for me.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.623
Totally, right?
All of it.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.623
All of it.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.125
Yes!

17:21.707 --> 17:23.125
OCD'd up, right?

17:23.208 --> 17:24.460
All of it. (laughs)

17:24.543 --> 17:27.129
Starts this weekend at,
uh, Water Adventure.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.839
Mm. Water Adventure.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.799
Don't forget to
bring the towels.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.799
Mm-hmm.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.093
At least she's not off to stay
with her boyfriend. That's...

17:33.177 --> 17:34.636
CLAY:
I, uh...

17:34.720 --> 17:35.971
I take it
Emma hasn't told this guy

17:36.054 --> 17:36.972
what her dad does
for a living yet?

17:37.055 --> 17:38.474
I really don't think

17:38.557 --> 17:41.101
"Chief Ops" title is gonna
scare the pants off him.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.020
I-I actually think
that you want to try

17:43.103 --> 17:44.646
and scare the pants back on him.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.024
Ah. Bump, bump. There it is.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.275
There it is.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.275
(laughter)

17:48.358 --> 17:49.693
Yeah, laugh it up.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.861
I'm sorry, man.
I don't mean to laugh.

17:50.944 --> 17:52.696
I'm sorry. I-I don't mean to
laugh. I don't mean to laugh.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.615
I'm just...
I'm proud of you is all.

17:54.698 --> 17:55.824
Proud of me? What?

17:54.698 --> 17:55.824
I'm proud of you.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.493
For not putting her boyfriend
on a ghost plane to Yemen?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.120
There's that. (laughs) No.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.663
But just, just after
seeing you be all in

18:01.747 --> 18:03.957
for so long with-with
Bravo, it's just nice

18:04.041 --> 18:06.335
seeing you all in on the
next phase of your life

18:06.418 --> 18:07.294
with Natalie and the kids.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.047
Kids are always gonna be
in my life, Ray.

18:10.130 --> 18:11.799
The other thing...

18:11.882 --> 18:12.925
Jason Hayes!

18:11.882 --> 18:12.925
There he is.

18:13.008 --> 18:16.053
Look at that. Hey, let's
get some shots going, boys.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.346
(whoops)

18:16.136 --> 18:17.346
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.849
I can't be getting zapped with
you tonight there, Sonny boy.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.185
Come on. What are you
talking about? Really?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.185
Yeah, sorry.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.646
Fine, man. Fine. Well,
it's just good to, uh...

18:25.729 --> 18:27.022
have the real
Bravo 1 here.

18:27.105 --> 18:30.025
Maybe, uh, you could
give us some wisdom

18:30.108 --> 18:31.819
and-and help us
out a little bit.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.987
Ah, man, I can't stay long.

18:34.071 --> 18:35.197
I got to get back,
take care of Cerberus.

18:35.280 --> 18:38.951
Come on, man. You can't make
bailing on Bravo a habit, bro.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.995
CLAY:
Actually, I...

18:42.079 --> 18:44.832
It's past my curfew.

18:42.079 --> 18:44.832
SONNY: Whoa.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.459
(laughing): I'll see you boys
tomorrow, all right?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.459
All right, brother.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.711
You know, it just
breaks my heart

18:49.795 --> 18:51.755
that Clay's gone
Elvis on us.

18:51.839 --> 18:55.926
You know, Lindell was, uh,
pretty hard on him.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.220
Oh, come on. You can't blame
the CO for his selfishness.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.389
Go easy on Spenser,
all right?

19:00.472 --> 19:02.224
But he put himself
over the team.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.767
Now Bravo's paying for it.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.354
Clay didn't write the letter.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.564
What are you talking about?

19:08.647 --> 19:10.065
What he did
was reckless.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.234
All right? It was risky.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.070
Damn near the most
selfless thing I've ever seen.

19:15.153 --> 19:17.489
You wrote the letter?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.284
JASON:
Look, truth comes out,

19:20.367 --> 19:22.744
Clay and Ray are both off
Bravo, so this stays here.

19:22.828 --> 19:24.913
Roger that.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.707
THIRTY MIKE:
I spoke with Lindell,

19:26.790 --> 19:28.542
assured him
Bravo will pull it together

19:28.625 --> 19:30.252
now that Prime Time is back.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.795
Now hold on. You
ain't put it all on me?

19:31.879 --> 19:34.298
Oh, I will,
'cause Lindell agreed.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.091
We're running the training op
again tomorrow.

19:36.174 --> 19:37.301
(whoops)

19:37.384 --> 19:38.886
Well played, Thirty.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.886
Amen.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.554
Why don't you keep
that winning streak going

19:40.637 --> 19:42.931
and buy us all
a round of shots?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.892
(laughter)

19:44.975 --> 19:47.144
Bravo's got a lot
riding on tomorrow.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.270
Ooh!

19:48.353 --> 19:49.187
THIRTY MIKE:
Need to be primed.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.187
Yep.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.273
Well, looks like
you're gonna have time

19:51.356 --> 19:52.649
to go walk Cerberus after all.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.568
I think I'll just
finish my drink first.

19:54.651 --> 19:55.694
You know, it's not like

19:55.777 --> 19:58.405
I have to wake up tomorrow
and be primed like you guys.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.740
Prime Time.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.618
(indistinct chatter)

20:02.701 --> 20:04.119
Enjoy the perks
of retirement, Hayes.

20:04.202 --> 20:06.914
♪ ♪

20:10.334 --> 20:13.420
♪ ♪

20:23.221 --> 20:26.516
All right. We turn it
around today, boys.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.644
Yeah, if you can stop confusing
your ass from your elbow.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.940
Hey, when Thirty says
go right, we go right, okay?

20:33.023 --> 20:35.025
Look, fellas,

20:35.108 --> 20:36.234
as much as we
don't like it,

20:36.318 --> 20:38.195
Jason is not walking through
that door to lead us to victory.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.155
But if we all stay
in our three-foot worlds,

20:40.238 --> 20:43.825
trust our man
to our left and right...

20:43.909 --> 20:46.161
Bravo will take its place back
atop the food chain.

20:46.244 --> 20:47.663
I promise you that.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.665
Okay?

20:49.748 --> 20:51.375
Come on.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.126
Warrant Officer Perry?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.837
Yeah.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.837
Your presence is requested.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.673
What for?

20:57.756 --> 20:59.341
You'll find out.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.219
Training's been scrubbed
'till tomorrow, gents.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.766
LINDELL:
Bravo's shot at redemption

21:07.849 --> 21:08.684
will have to wait.

21:08.767 --> 21:10.811
I'm certain they'll
turn things around, sir.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.646
Well, perhaps.
Just be sure Bravo's troubles

21:12.729 --> 21:14.231
won't impact you, Ensign Davis.

21:14.314 --> 21:15.524
How's that, sir?

21:15.607 --> 21:16.692
Your stellar work
hasn't gone unnoticed.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.859
You're being promoted.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.861
You're an
exemplary officer,

21:19.945 --> 21:22.531
the type of leader the Navy
needs more of, and while...

21:22.614 --> 21:24.074
Bravo might be stuck in reverse,

21:24.157 --> 21:26.034
your star is on the rise
at the Command.

21:26.118 --> 21:26.952
Thank you, sir.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.745
Why did Bravo's
mission get scrubbed?

21:28.829 --> 21:31.873
There's a situation
with Warrant Officer Perry.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.375
Situation? What do you mean?
What happened?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.377
That's not of concern
to you, Master Chief.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.462
It's my concern.
He's my teammate.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.840
Former teammate.

21:39.923 --> 21:43.093
Have you solved
Echo's air asset issue?

21:43.176 --> 21:45.512
I wanted
an answer today.

21:43.176 --> 21:45.512
Not yet, sir.

21:45.595 --> 21:47.723
Then I suggest you train
your scope on your job

21:47.806 --> 21:48.974
instead of Warrant
Officer Perry.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.566
(knocks)

21:59.192 --> 22:00.694
Warrant Officer Perry,

22:00.777 --> 22:03.238
this is Agent Olivia Green.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.163
CIA is requesting support
from Special Activities

22:11.246 --> 22:12.873
on this assignment.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.584
First assignment as warrant.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.878
You guys don't
waste time, do you?

22:17.961 --> 22:19.629
Over the last six months,
Tunisia's endured

22:19.713 --> 22:22.215
a series of terrorist attacks
by Ansar Al-Masar.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.801
The scale and frequency
of the violence is on the rise,

22:24.885 --> 22:27.763
threatening to destabilize one
of our key allies in the region.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.432
You and Agent Green
will head to Tunis,

22:30.515 --> 22:33.101
collect intel, smooth over
any diplomatic issues

22:33.185 --> 22:35.145
and build
a target package.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.564
Bravo will join you
to prosecute the mission

22:37.647 --> 22:39.941
if they're cleared hot.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.941
And if they're not?

22:40.025 --> 22:41.443
As a warrant officer,
you are aware

22:41.526 --> 22:43.737
you're no longer in a monogamous
relationship with Bravo?

22:43.820 --> 22:45.280
Roger that, ma'am.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.282
How long
till we roll up our sleeves?

22:47.365 --> 22:48.950
Wheels up tomorrow morning.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.620
Oh.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.788
Is that gonna be a problem?

22:52.871 --> 22:54.331
I only got home yesterday--

22:54.414 --> 22:56.416
I wasn't planning
to blow out so quick.

22:56.500 --> 22:59.294
Ah. Sorry the war on terror

22:59.377 --> 23:01.379
isn't working
around your schedule.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.173
I'll find another OIC
if needed.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.175
That won't be necessary, ma'am.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.760
Read me in.

23:09.888 --> 23:12.015
(knocks "shave and a haircut")

23:12.099 --> 23:14.101
Hey there, little buddy.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.103
Shouldn't you be out
leading Bravo to glory?

23:16.186 --> 23:18.313
Ah, yep,
but the plug just got pulled.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.649
Ray is needed elsewhere.

23:21.691 --> 23:22.651
Oh, uh,

23:22.734 --> 23:23.485
don't worry,

23:23.568 --> 23:25.695
I just heard
it had to do with S.A.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.781
It's got nothing to do
with Marsden.

23:27.864 --> 23:29.324
Why would it?

23:27.864 --> 23:29.324
(chuckles)

23:29.407 --> 23:31.284
You know, I...
I really can't figure

23:31.368 --> 23:33.995
you jumping on that grenade
for Ray, if it was the...

23:34.079 --> 23:37.582
dumbest thing you ever did
or whether it was the noblest.

23:38.416 --> 23:41.128
It was the best way
to keep us all with Bravo.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.171
Yeah, suppose
that's true, but...

23:43.255 --> 23:45.340
you ain't on Bravo anymore.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.217
So don't you think
it's time you, uh,

23:47.300 --> 23:48.635
mend the fence with Lindell?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.804
Hmm?

23:48.718 --> 23:50.804
He doesn't want to hear from me.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.598
No, look, man, I'm sure
he's got a... a red ass.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.183
Right?

23:55.267 --> 23:58.603
But they're sending out Ray,
and Bravo is un-operational.

23:59.646 --> 24:02.357
Clay, the team
needs you, okay?

24:02.440 --> 24:04.359
Jason's pulled himself
out of the game.

24:04.442 --> 24:06.862
Ray has got all these
new responsibilities.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.532
We just need your help
to turn this Bravo ship around

24:10.615 --> 24:12.492
before we all sink.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.203
Help us,

24:15.287 --> 24:16.997
Obi-Blonde Kenobi.

24:17.080 --> 24:18.623
You're our only hope.

24:21.334 --> 24:23.461
Now, listen, I just don't think
you should be goofing off,

24:23.545 --> 24:24.921
is all I'm saying, all right?

24:25.005 --> 24:27.048
You got to learn your lines
for your play.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.009
Isn't that right?
Who wants a chicken strip?

24:29.092 --> 24:31.011
All right,
good boy.

24:31.094 --> 24:32.554
If you're not all in,
you're all out.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.222
Clara says, like, 20 words.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.016
You got to be off
book by Monday.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.434
That's what
the professor said, right?

24:37.517 --> 24:39.186
You were so much less annoying

24:39.269 --> 24:40.604
when you knew nothing
about my life.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.605
(groans)

24:41.688 --> 24:43.231
Speaking of the show,

24:43.315 --> 24:45.025
since it's a modern adaptation,

24:45.108 --> 24:47.569
could you mail me
the beautiful camel hair coat

24:47.652 --> 24:48.862

24:48.945 --> 24:50.572
It's perfect.

24:50.655 --> 24:53.575
♪ ♪

24:54.659 --> 24:56.578
The camel hair coat. Right.

24:56.661 --> 24:57.704
Um...

24:58.830 --> 25:01.041
Yeah, I think it's in storage.

25:01.124 --> 25:02.918
No worries.
I can make do without.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.879
So, how's work?

25:05.962 --> 25:07.923
You liking the ops chief job?

25:08.006 --> 25:10.926
You know, I just... I got to
serve out my enlistment somehow,

25:11.009 --> 25:13.762
so... it works, I guess.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.972
I am proud of you for the way
you're handling everything.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.099
Well, don't be too proud,
all right?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.101
'Cause Uncle Ray tapped
Brad's phone.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.228
I know where you
are at all times.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.939
I mean, it's nice seeing you put
your own happiness first

25:24.022 --> 25:26.274
after all you've sacrificed
for Bravo.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.652
Natalie's a big part
of that happiness, isn't she?

25:28.735 --> 25:30.987
I suppose.
All right, why am I feeling

25:31.071 --> 25:33.240
that this is
some kind of a trap?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.909
You know her term at DEVGRU
is up at the end of next month.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.953
And there it is.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.996
So, what's your plan?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.332
Plan? I don't have a plan.
I was just, you know,

25:42.415 --> 25:44.584
taking it day to day,
see how it unfolds.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.920
But she might move back
to San Diego soon.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.673
You can't afford to take things
one day at a time.

25:49.756 --> 25:52.175
Natalie's amazing,
and you deserve to have someone

25:52.259 --> 25:54.469
in your life like that
after everything.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.471
It's complicated.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.599
If you're not all in,
you're all out.

26:01.184 --> 26:02.686
If you're really committed
to your future,

26:02.769 --> 26:04.020
why are you holding back
with Natalie?

26:06.439 --> 26:08.149
I have to go.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.610
Talk to Natalie, Dad.
I love you.

26:10.694 --> 26:11.987
I love you, too.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.698
(sighs)

26:14.781 --> 26:16.992
Two months of desk duty
hardly amounts to time served.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.619
The State Department wanted
your head on a platter

26:19.703 --> 26:21.663
after that Marsden stunt.

26:21.746 --> 26:23.164
But I appreciate you
not giving it to them.

26:23.248 --> 26:26.167
My time away from Bravo
has given me a new perspective.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.712
I know that I failed
my team, and...

26:28.795 --> 26:30.338
the Command and you.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.090
In all that failing,
you still feel

26:32.173 --> 26:33.717
you've earned your place
back on Bravo?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.844
Team's in disarray.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.846
I can help
turn things around, sir.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.848
Well, that's
pretty arrogant.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.309
But your ability as an operator
has never been in question,

26:42.392 --> 26:45.395
which is why I stuck my neck
out for you for STA-21.

26:46.646 --> 26:49.482
Sir, I'll prove you were right
to believe in me.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.362
You know, Bravo just said
goodbye to one cowboy,

26:54.446 --> 26:57.699
and the last thing they need
is another boat-rocker.

26:57.782 --> 27:01.161
So you will operate
again one day, Spenser,

27:01.244 --> 27:02.871
but it won't be with Bravo Team.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.171
Well, here I am
running out again.

27:11.254 --> 27:16.551
Well, we knew changes
would come with your new job.

27:16.634 --> 27:18.887
Good thing
the Perry family bends,

27:18.970 --> 27:20.555
we don't break.

27:18.970 --> 27:20.555
I took this job

27:20.638 --> 27:22.849
to help the family-- now I
barely feel like I'm part of it.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.935
Can't help but wonder if going
warrant was the right choice.

27:26.936 --> 27:28.563
Been in this long enough

27:28.646 --> 27:31.566
to know there aren't any right
decisions for military families,

27:31.649 --> 27:33.068
just hard ones.
(sighs)

27:33.151 --> 27:34.903
I know, babe, but...

27:34.986 --> 27:37.864
Bravo needs me now, too, and
I'm not there for them, either.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.575
It's just...
it's just adding up.

27:40.658 --> 27:42.827
Want me to wake up the kids
so you can kiss them goodbye?

27:43.870 --> 27:45.413
(sighs):
Oh... no.

27:45.497 --> 27:48.416
They were so upset when I
told them I was leaving,

27:48.500 --> 27:51.669
I'm not sure I can handle
another round of tears.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.713
I'll kiss them
when I get back.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.593
Mm.

27:58.676 --> 28:01.262
Remember, we're
in this together.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.806
JASON:
Morning.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.474
Hey, hey.
(whistles)

28:04.557 --> 28:06.434
Hey. How was your drive?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.269
Ah, hit some traffic
coming out of Baltimore,

28:08.353 --> 28:09.938
but, uh, not too bad.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.774
It's very cool of you to take
her that coat for her show.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.275
That's just trying
to be supportive.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.945
Plus, I got a chance
to size up Brad.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.945
My dad never

28:17.028 --> 28:18.905
would have let me stay
with a boy at her age.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.573
Thanks for reminding me.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.573
(laughs)

28:20.657 --> 28:22.617
It shows that
you trust her.

28:22.700 --> 28:25.078
It's a good thing.
It's nice to see

28:25.161 --> 28:28.123
your relationship
evolving.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.333
Sorry I missed dinner.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.627
I actually got a lot done.

28:32.710 --> 28:33.628
That's it.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.964
The final report.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.964
First draft.

28:36.047 --> 28:38.133
An entire year's worth of data.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.052
Can't believe
my time's almost up here.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.598
Do you want to get lunch later?

28:49.269 --> 28:51.729
I should keep my head down.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.149
Report deadline's
rapidly approaching.

28:54.232 --> 28:55.775
All right.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.986
All in all the time. I like it.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.325
CLAY:
Shouldn't you be getting ready
for the training op?

29:04.409 --> 29:05.994
(laughs)
I was kind of hoping

29:06.077 --> 29:07.996
that we'd be, uh,
getting ready together.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.123
What's the word, man?

29:10.915 --> 29:12.834
I'm not rolling
with you today.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.503
Son of a bitch.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.380
Lindell give you any idea
how long it's gonna be

29:17.464 --> 29:18.840
'till the shackles come off?

29:18.923 --> 29:21.009
Don't you go shy on me, Clay.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.053
What's the word?

29:24.137 --> 29:25.638
So how long you
over there for?

29:25.722 --> 29:27.015
(scoffs)
Could be weeks.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.516
(sniffles)

29:27.098 --> 29:28.516
Man, I got whiplash

29:28.600 --> 29:31.019
from being jerked around
so much. (laughs)

29:31.102 --> 29:33.646
Tell you what. I'd be happy
to trade this chaos

29:33.730 --> 29:34.856
for the, uh,
routine and stability

29:34.939 --> 29:35.982
of your life right now.

29:36.065 --> 29:37.442
Yeah, well, I don't really feel

29:37.525 --> 29:39.152
like I'm on stable ground.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.862
Come on now, brother.

29:40.945 --> 29:42.739
Path you're on has got a lot
of light to it.

29:42.822 --> 29:43.907
Thought you said
you were pushing on.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.408
Yeah, I... (sighs)

29:45.492 --> 29:48.536
You know, when I stood down,
Bravo was in a good place.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.371
Now, everything that's going on,

29:50.455 --> 29:52.540
I feel responsible
for this whole mess.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.540
Two days ago,

29:52.624 --> 29:55.168
you told me it wasn't on you
to get Bravo back on track.

29:55.251 --> 29:58.421
(scoffs)

29:58.505 --> 30:01.549
You held up Bravo
all those years.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.761
Mm.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.761
It's about damn time
we tried standing on our own.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.847
Be good for you to stand
on your own, too.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.847
(door trills, opens)

30:07.931 --> 30:10.058
What the hell you got
to say for yourself, Ray?

30:10.141 --> 30:11.935
What?

30:10.141 --> 30:11.935
Whoa, whoa. What's your problem?

30:12.018 --> 30:13.728
Lindell has permanently
pulled Clay from Bravo because

30:13.811 --> 30:16.898
of what he did.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.898
Well, you're off Br...
You're off Bravo?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.733
Yeah.

30:18.816 --> 30:21.110
I'm sorry it's gone down
this way. I... Well...

30:21.194 --> 30:23.738
My choice, my consequences.
I'll handle it.

30:23.821 --> 30:26.407
SONNY:
You know, behind that
pious front of yours, Ray,

30:26.491 --> 30:28.910
you are one selfish
son of a bitch.

30:26.491 --> 30:28.910
Hey, hey!

30:28.993 --> 30:30.411
Hey!

30:28.993 --> 30:30.411
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Come on, man.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.247
Hey, this isn't on, Ray, man.

30:32.330 --> 30:33.915
This is my decision.
Now I got to own it.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.501
This sucks, but you got
to adapt and overcome.

30:33.998 --> 30:36.501
Oh... (scoffs)

30:36.584 --> 30:37.919
He shivved one of our brothers,

30:38.002 --> 30:39.921
and all you can say,
all you can say, Jace,

30:40.004 --> 30:42.006
is "adapt and overcome"?

30:40.004 --> 30:42.006
I would give

30:42.090 --> 30:43.758
anything to fix this,
Sonny, I would.

30:43.841 --> 30:47.345
Yeah. (breathing hard)

30:43.841 --> 30:47.345
I would, man.

30:47.428 --> 30:48.930
But you know, the team would be
a lot better off

30:49.013 --> 30:50.598
if instead of you
pinning your hopes

30:50.682 --> 30:52.600
on everyone else to fix Bravo,
you actually be part

30:52.684 --> 30:54.310
of the solution for a change.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.310
Yeah, you managed

30:54.394 --> 30:57.272
to nuke Bravo with one foot
out the door to make warrant.

30:57.355 --> 31:00.108
Imagine the damage
that you could have inflicted

31:00.191 --> 31:02.277
if you had the brass
to run your own team!

31:03.903 --> 31:06.030
(breathing hard)

31:10.702 --> 31:11.869
I got a flight to catch.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.663
Yeah, you do.

31:13.746 --> 31:15.331
Clay, I'm sorry.

31:15.415 --> 31:17.458
I'm sorry, man.
I'm sor... I'm sorry.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.628
I'm sorry.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.628
Get your head on straight.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.338
You got to perform for the team.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.340
Stop. Sto...
I-I don't need

31:24.424 --> 31:28.803
to be lectured on what
the team needs from a guy...

31:28.886 --> 31:30.972
from a guy that quit on us.

31:32.974 --> 31:35.184
Yeah, that's what
you did, Jason.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.156
THIRTY MIKE:
Havoc, this is Bravo 1.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.991
I pass Lansford.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.537
Good copy, 1.

31:51.743 --> 31:54.537
How they doing?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.998
Right on schedule.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.002
Come on, boys.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.837
You got this.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.048
♪ ♪

32:32.241 --> 32:33.826
Set.

32:33.910 --> 32:37.205
And three, two, one--

32:33.910 --> 32:37.205
(air horn blows)

32:37.288 --> 32:39.999
Freeze! Safe and let them hang.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.542
Secure that firing device,
Trent.

32:41.626 --> 32:42.877
THIRTY MIKE:
What the hell's going on, sir?

32:42.960 --> 32:44.671
I have accountability.
MSD is set.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.047
That breach is totally safe.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.216
This is a training evolution.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.593
(groans)

32:51.803 --> 32:54.055
We have live rounds on target.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.390
Son of a bitch.

32:55.473 --> 32:57.058
Sonny, what the hell, man?

32:57.141 --> 32:59.143
That's it for the day.
Grab your gear. You're done.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.330
LINDELL:
Come on in.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.085
Shouldn't you be coordinating
Echo's air assets?

33:24.168 --> 33:26.254
Sir, I'm here about Bravo.

33:24.168 --> 33:26.254
I'm more concerned

33:26.337 --> 33:28.089
about my teams
out in the field than the ones

33:28.172 --> 33:29.924
who can't stop peeing
down their own leg.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.801
All right, well, the quickest
way to combat readiness

33:31.884 --> 33:33.970
for Bravo Team is
to get Spenser back on the team.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.972
Spenser made his own bed.

33:36.055 --> 33:38.558
So, what, Bravo's now
collateral damage?

33:38.641 --> 33:40.560
Echo needed
an air asset solve

33:40.643 --> 33:42.145
yesterday,
yet you're more concerned

33:42.228 --> 33:43.938
with Bravo's training troubles.

33:44.021 --> 33:47.066
My job is to support all the
assault teams at the Command.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.277
I know how
to make Bravo right again.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.947
Yeah, of course you do.

33:53.030 --> 33:55.825
Nobody knows Bravo like you do.

33:55.908 --> 33:58.453
But your expertise in Bravo?

33:58.536 --> 34:01.122
That stopped mattering
the moment you stepped down,

34:01.205 --> 34:03.082
but you haven't
accepted that.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.460
And you're hurting yourself
by not embracing your future.

34:05.543 --> 34:06.794
You're hurting Bravo

34:06.878 --> 34:08.629
by not allowing them
to move on, either.

34:08.713 --> 34:10.006
Their battle
is no longer yours to fight,

34:10.089 --> 34:11.799
yet here you are.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.009
You're leading the charge.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.969
And look,
I know it's not easy

34:15.052 --> 34:16.429
to go from the sandbox
to the head shed,

34:16.512 --> 34:17.972
but right now,
you are stuck in no-man's-land,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.390
and you're of no use
to anyone.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.808
Not yourself. Not Bravo.

34:20.892 --> 34:22.727
Certainly not me.

34:22.810 --> 34:24.645
So you flip that switch,
Master Chief,

34:24.729 --> 34:25.813
or I will do it for you.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.315
We clear?

34:27.398 --> 34:29.817
Crystal clear, sir.

34:29.901 --> 34:33.112
I'm not allowed to help Bravo
in the ops center.

34:35.573 --> 34:38.201
Oh, one more thing.
DEA will give you

34:38.284 --> 34:39.952
the air assets
you need for Echo.

34:40.036 --> 34:41.329
It's unconventional,

34:41.412 --> 34:43.998
but they helped me out
when I was in a jam.

34:51.756 --> 34:53.174
You're well aware,
Ambassador, of the damage

34:53.257 --> 34:55.176
Ansar Al-Masar has done here.

34:55.259 --> 34:56.677
Seven attacks
targeting Westerners

34:56.761 --> 34:57.595
in the past six months.

34:57.678 --> 34:59.806
Each attack more brazen
than the previous.

34:59.889 --> 35:02.558
And effective. Confidence
in the government is wavering.

35:02.642 --> 35:03.768
Well, we'll balance those scales

35:03.851 --> 35:06.354
if we're allowed to hunt down
the perpetrators.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.354
Perhaps.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.189
But American soldiers
shooting up the country

35:08.272 --> 35:10.691
poses a whole different set
of problems for the Tunisians.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.820
Well, we're sailors, ma'am,

35:13.903 --> 35:16.405
and nobody will know we're here.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.993
(sighs)

35:23.955 --> 35:25.998
Cerberus!

35:27.959 --> 35:30.878
Be kidding me.

35:30.962 --> 35:32.880
(sighs)

35:32.964 --> 35:34.590
(keys clatter)

35:32.964 --> 35:34.590
(whimpers)

35:37.802 --> 35:39.762
(sighs)

35:41.806 --> 35:45.810
It's okay. It's okay.

35:47.103 --> 35:50.022
You know,
you're not bred for this life.

35:50.106 --> 35:52.608
It's not your fault.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.153
(sighs)

35:57.864 --> 35:59.866
All this time,
I've been blaming Thirty,

35:59.949 --> 36:02.243
and here I am,
the one costing Bravo.

36:02.326 --> 36:05.079
Yeah, but you're gonna
turn things around.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.540
I'm not too sure,
with the...

36:07.623 --> 36:08.875
the tailspin we're in,

36:08.958 --> 36:10.585
we're gonna be able
to pull out of this.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.546
Just make sure you don't get
any of this Bravo stank on you,

36:13.629 --> 36:14.964
okay?

36:13.629 --> 36:14.964
(chuckles)

36:15.047 --> 36:16.966
Actually,

36:17.049 --> 36:19.886
I'm getting promoted.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.929
I mean, I know...
It feels a little weird,

36:22.013 --> 36:23.890
you know,
with everybody struggling.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.892
Well, that's great.
I mean, I mean,

36:25.975 --> 36:28.936
that-that-that is truly
the best news I've heard

36:29.020 --> 36:31.939
since we called jackpot
on Al-Hazred Jr.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.939
(chuckles)

36:32.023 --> 36:33.733
It's not a big deal.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.193
No, what do you mean?
Of course it's a big deal.

36:36.277 --> 36:38.070
You know, a year ago, you
were questioning everything.

36:38.154 --> 36:40.615
And now it seems like you
might be the only one

36:40.698 --> 36:42.575
that's got any type
of answer around here.

36:55.212 --> 36:58.799
uh, Thirty wants us to
stick around this weekend...

36:58.883 --> 37:00.968
Ah.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.968
and do some extra
training. Yeah.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.971
So, the-the getaway
to Charlotte's off.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.098
Right?

37:04.055 --> 37:06.098
Yeah.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.934
You know,
it's probably for the best

37:08.017 --> 37:09.977
given my promotion.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.605
Higher profile
means more eyes.

37:12.688 --> 37:16.192
(chuckles) It's always
something with us, huh?

37:26.285 --> 37:28.829
It's hard not to when
it's staring at you in the face.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.123
Tell you what.

37:31.207 --> 37:34.377
Why don't I, uh,
get another round and...

(laughs)
No. No, no.

38:04.156 --> 38:06.659
Reunions are-are definitely not
in the cards

38:06.742 --> 38:08.035
this week, Mr. Spenser.

38:13.916 --> 38:16.877
Still hasn't sunk in

38:17.712 --> 38:20.214
Not how I saw it playing out.

38:17.712 --> 38:20.214
I guess that makes

38:20.297 --> 38:22.425
Lindell our Yoko Ono.

38:22.508 --> 38:25.011
(chuckles softly)

38:22.508 --> 38:25.011
(laughs)

38:25.094 --> 38:27.221
You know,
even though we're not teammates,

38:27.304 --> 38:29.682
we're still brothers.

38:29.765 --> 38:32.184
Your words.

38:29.765 --> 38:32.184
Oh, boy,
please don't remind me of that.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.562
Ray's still both.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.148
You know,
you went at him pretty hard.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.191
Jason, too.

38:37.231 --> 38:39.191
Hell yeah, I did.

38:39.275 --> 38:41.485
Thanks to them,
Bravo as we know it is dead.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.157
No easy day.

38:46.240 --> 38:48.075
Yeah.

38:48.159 --> 38:52.997
Unless our knight in shining
armor is here to save us.

38:56.959 --> 38:58.961
Surprised you called.

39:00.671 --> 39:04.341
Looks like your boys need
a morale boost.

39:05.968 --> 39:10.514
JASON:
Yeah. Yeah, they do
need my help.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.433
Thanks.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.269
There's, uh, only one way
I can give it to 'em.

39:15.352 --> 39:17.813
By operating again.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.733
(exhales sharply)

39:23.027 --> 39:24.904
You know...
(clears throat)

39:24.987 --> 39:28.783
...these past two
months, I, uh...

39:28.866 --> 39:31.952
I've been really trying
just to keep my head down.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.830
Adjust to my new life.

39:34.914 --> 39:39.919
And, uh, every time
I think about the future,

39:40.002 --> 39:43.047
you know, I think
about the unknown.

39:43.130 --> 39:46.133
When I think about
the past, I...

39:46.217 --> 39:47.760
I think about Bravo.

39:47.843 --> 39:50.763
The team and the job you loved.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.306
It's hard to let go of that.

39:52.389 --> 39:55.559
(exhales deeply)

39:55.643 --> 40:00.439
You know, my first
open-water swim at BUD/S

40:00.523 --> 40:03.776
almost washed me out.

40:03.859 --> 40:07.321
The current took me,
and I, um, I panicked

40:07.404 --> 40:10.157
and I got disoriented;
it was a mess.

40:10.241 --> 40:13.244
The unknown is-is scary,

40:13.327 --> 40:14.995
but you didn't give up.

40:15.079 --> 40:16.664
Yeah, 'cause I had
a swim buddy there

40:16.747 --> 40:18.332
who helped me find my way.

40:18.415 --> 40:22.002
The unknown has always
been a safe place for me

40:22.086 --> 40:24.046
because I've always had
my teammates by my side.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.966
Probably why it's been
so hard for me to...

40:27.049 --> 40:29.844
let go of them
since I left Bravo.

40:29.927 --> 40:32.888
Bravo hasn't let go either.

40:32.972 --> 40:35.015
No, they haven't.

40:35.099 --> 40:37.017
They haven't let go,
but they have to.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.894
And so do I.

40:38.978 --> 40:41.397
So I was thinking maybe, uh,

40:41.480 --> 40:44.024
it'd be a lot easier for me
to take on the unknown

40:44.108 --> 40:46.819
if you stayed here
in Virginia Beach.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.534
That's a big conversation.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.828
I like big conversations.

40:59.206 --> 41:01.250
That's definitely one
worth having.

41:05.296 --> 41:08.382
But talking isn't really

41:08.465 --> 41:11.510
what I had in mind for tonight.

41:11.594 --> 41:12.845
Do you want to get out of here?

41:12.928 --> 41:14.930
Yeah. Let's
push on, huh?

41:33.449 --> 41:35.826
(indistinct chatter)

41:38.704 --> 41:42.041
You handled the ambassador
like an old pro.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.418
Uh, I don't know.

41:44.501 --> 41:45.920
Honestly, I'm a lot
more comfortable

41:46.003 --> 41:48.881
getting shot at than
I am playing politics.

41:48.964 --> 41:50.925
Your contact's late.

41:52.801 --> 41:55.554
Well, you have to learn
patience in this job.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.432
Little less point and shoot
than you're used to.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.432
Oh, well,

41:58.515 --> 42:00.768
change and operators
aren't always a good mix.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.770
No?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.770
No.

42:02.853 --> 42:04.605
You should meet
my former team leader...
