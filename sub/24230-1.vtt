00:31.498 --> 00:33.198
I've got it. Golf!

00:33.199 --> 00:34.733
What?

00:34.734 --> 00:36.301
I don't even know
how to play golf?

00:36.302 --> 00:38.437
It's easy. You just try and
get the ball in the hole

00:38.438 --> 00:40.373
with the least number of tries.
Go left here.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.915
Then the way they drive around
in those fairy-looking buggies.

00:44.939 --> 00:46.707
Slow down. There's
a tee up ahead.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.214
It's because you play 18 holes.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.935
The courses are so big,
it takes ages to get

00:50.959 --> 00:52.684
to the next one, so
they use the buggies.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.486
Sounds fucked.

00:54.487 --> 00:56.089
We got company.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.125
Well, it's Scottish. Punch it!

01:31.124 --> 01:33.092
All right, there's
a fork up ahead.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.193
Bridge, building, or swamp?

01:34.194 --> 01:35.727
Your decision. Make it fast.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.130
Umm...

01:38.598 --> 01:39.765
Come on. Left or right?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.800
Let's just say a smart
man would go left.

01:41.801 --> 01:43.403
Your call.

01:58.685 --> 01:59.819
Punch it, Buzz.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.160
Yeah-hoo!

02:08.161 --> 02:10.496
Yeah!

02:10.497 --> 02:12.598
L Coming around onto
the final strike,

02:12.599 --> 02:14.299
we have our leading contestants.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.734
The Rovers in the lead

02:15.735 --> 02:17.736
followed closely by
the Booth brothers.

02:17.737 --> 02:20.206
Yeah!

02:32.785 --> 02:34.753
All right, we got
this one in the bag.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.222
Just be smart about
the hill climb.

02:47.934 --> 02:50.269
He'll take the Giggler,
so we'll take the Gooch.

02:50.270 --> 02:53.505
- No, Gooch. I said "Gooch."
- I heard you. Guillotine.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.507
Buzz, what the fuck
are you doing?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.176
- Trust me!
- Aah!

02:57.177 --> 02:59.645
The Rovers are going
for the Guillotine.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.814
We all know that Buzz
can't resist a challenge.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.188
Don't forget to breathe.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.323
Don't fuck this up!

03:15.628 --> 03:18.230
Here we are at the
final challenge.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.865
If the Rovers complete
the Guillotine,

03:19.866 --> 03:22.768
they'll collect 20 bonus
points to win the dash.

03:22.769 --> 03:26.472
But to do that, they've got to get
over the perilous Razor blade.

03:44.958 --> 03:49.462
L Get that winch there, bloke.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.433
Shit!

04:10.316 --> 04:11.951
Buzz, don't do it. Take it slow.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.822
Come on.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.293
Fuck it.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.333
Buzz!

04:39.445 --> 04:40.680
Buzz?

04:45.451 --> 04:46.486
Buzz?

04:48.588 --> 04:50.389
Buzz, mate, you all right?

04:50.390 --> 04:51.691
Buzz, talk to me.

04:52.659 --> 04:53.793
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.396
Thank Christ for that.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.804
This year's winners of the
annual Huntville dash,

05:05.805 --> 05:09.008
returning champion Richard
and Travis Booth.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.980
Oh, Christ!

05:19.786 --> 05:20.953
Oh, shit.

05:23.790 --> 05:24.890
Are you all right?

05:24.891 --> 05:25.992
Yeah.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.627
Hundred percent?

05:28.628 --> 05:29.862
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.532
Good.

05:33.666 --> 05:34.801
Prick!

05:37.603 --> 05:40.439
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

05:40.440 --> 05:42.440
What's your problem? You
weren't even in the truck.

05:42.464 --> 05:43.742
Buzz, are you all right?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.644
I'm fine until this prick
cold-cocks me for no reason.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.045
All right for you. You
didn't have to dodge

05:47.046 --> 05:48.814
the world's first
fucking flying vehicle.

05:48.815 --> 05:50.717
I'll make it up to you
on Mother's Day, okay?

05:52.118 --> 05:54.020
Make it up to you on
Mother's Day right now.

05:55.621 --> 05:57.556
Folks, it looks like
we've got another case

05:57.557 --> 05:59.391
of history repeating
itself here.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.893
Just like last year,
Buzz and his navigator

06:01.894 --> 06:02.962
are having a domestic.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.367
What do I owe you, Abe?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.634
Buzz, fuck off.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.002
What do I owe you?

06:11.003 --> 06:12.738
Are we seriously doing
this shit again?

06:12.739 --> 06:16.007
Say it. Say it!

06:16.008 --> 06:17.976
- Nothing.
- What's that?

06:17.977 --> 06:19.112
You owe me nothing.

06:24.851 --> 06:26.486
So, what now then?

06:27.520 --> 06:29.021
No prize money, no fuel.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.557
Guess you're staying
here after all.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.758
Supposed to be there Monday
or they'll get someone else.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.063
The Ranger's coming
for you, Buzz.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.032
City or not, he'll
catch up with you.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.504
Do you really wanna be driving
around the city all day,

06:45.505 --> 06:47.172
delivering packages to suits?

06:47.173 --> 06:48.840
You really gonna stay out here?

06:48.841 --> 06:51.544
Bumming odd jobs off
farmers and miners?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.647
Living off baked
beans and roadkill?

06:55.648 --> 06:56.849
That was the dream, wasn't it?

06:57.784 --> 06:58.818
Dreams change, Abe.

07:00.019 --> 07:03.089
Bed, hot meal, steady paycheck.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.991
That's all that matters.

07:05.992 --> 07:08.694
If you're smart, you'll
be coming with me.

07:14.567 --> 07:15.902
So, you catching the train then?

07:17.537 --> 07:18.771
I'll figure it out.

07:35.087 --> 07:37.889
Big business versus
the environment,

07:37.890 --> 07:40.759
a battle raging since the
dawn of the industrial age.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.961
Whatever side of the
issue you may be on,

07:42.962 --> 07:46.164
one thing's for sure, this
philosophical disagreement

07:46.165 --> 07:49.534
has in the past few months
turned to all-out war.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.070
Just last year, a group
calling itself "Apocalypto"

07:52.071 --> 07:54.239
claimed responsibility
for an explosion

07:54.240 --> 07:56.107
at the Madsen Coal
Mine in Chile.

07:56.108 --> 07:58.009
We are happy to
come to the table.

07:58.010 --> 08:00.812
We've been adapting
to new regulations

08:00.813 --> 08:03.515
and new information as
soon as it comes to life.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.518
All evidence suggests that
Madsen may be true to his word

08:06.519 --> 08:08.119
with the mining giant
recently signing

08:08.120 --> 08:09.888
the controversial Oasis Pact.

08:09.889 --> 08:14.493
Oasis is committed to perfecting
sustainable mining practices.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.895
And Madsen Mineral,
by signing our pact,

08:16.896 --> 08:18.597
shows that they're serious

08:18.598 --> 08:20.499
about sustainable future
for their company.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.002
Madsen is currently in Australia
to oversee the initial blasting

08:24.003 --> 08:25.871
of his most ambitious
project yet,

08:25.872 --> 08:28.273
the controversial
Mamuya West Gold Mine.

08:28.274 --> 08:30.976
Security has been ramped up
to unprecedented levels.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.979
We are not gonna
take any chances.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.181
We welcome honest debate.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.582
But we're not gonna
be dictated to

08:38.583 --> 08:41.520
by misinformed radicals
and terrorists.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.481
Now, there are two points
that I'd like to make...

08:44.056 --> 08:45.191
You want another one?

08:47.193 --> 08:48.594
Sure.

08:54.667 --> 08:55.901
That guy...

08:55.902 --> 08:57.569
you know him?

08:57.570 --> 08:58.604
Hmm.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.573
He's not from around here.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.708
He's a Rover.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.811
- Heard him called Buzz.
- A Rover?

09:07.613 --> 09:08.893
You've not heard of Rovers then?

09:10.683 --> 09:12.317
You ever been driving along...

09:12.318 --> 09:14.587
seen a track leading
off the highway?

09:16.589 --> 09:18.757
Most of those tracks
probably don't lead anywhere

09:18.758 --> 09:19.859
but a dead end.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.161
But you pick the right one...

09:23.262 --> 09:24.797
maybe it'll keep going.

09:25.965 --> 09:28.166
Maybe you'll end up in
the middle of nowhere

09:28.167 --> 09:30.736
far from the cares
of civilized men.

09:32.271 --> 09:35.907
Maybe you'll end up
in Rover territory.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.345
Where the only rule of law
is by the barrel of a gun.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.784
Maybe you won't come back.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.355
They dangerous?

09:53.593 --> 09:55.227
Bunch of dickheads.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.056
Oi, check this one out.

10:26.692 --> 10:29.694
Yeah, right. You gonna show her how dirty
things get out in the country, eh?

10:29.695 --> 10:31.696
No, she's city.

10:31.697 --> 10:33.665
Ah, that's nothing you
can't handle, mate.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.226
What was the name of that chick
that you grubbed in Alice Springs?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.269
No, not Alice Springs.
I mean "city" city.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.838
What's more city
than Alice Springs?

10:39.839 --> 10:41.319
You're not thinking
Bathurst, are you?

10:41.343 --> 10:42.811
No, not fucking Bathurst.

10:43.709 --> 10:44.843
Like Wagga Wagga, maybe.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.344
Shit. You reckon?

10:46.345 --> 10:49.280
Hey there. You're,
uh, Buzz, right?

10:49.281 --> 10:50.715
The, uh, the Rover?

10:50.716 --> 10:52.317
- G'day.
- I'm Eric.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.718
Do you, uh, do you
have a minute?

10:53.719 --> 10:55.854
Busy as a cat burying
shit right now, mate.

10:55.855 --> 10:58.991
Great! I've been
speaking to some locals.

11:00.159 --> 11:01.726
They said you wouldn't
pull a U-turn

11:01.727 --> 11:03.527
even if it meant driving
straight off a cliff.

11:03.551 --> 11:04.663
Fair thinking.

11:04.664 --> 11:05.730
I'm thinking you might be

11:05.731 --> 11:06.891
just the kind of guy we need.

11:06.915 --> 11:07.899
True.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.835
Sorry, are you, uh...
Are you mocking me?

11:10.836 --> 11:14.139
Uh, don't mean to be rude,
I honestly can't tell.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.774
Cut to the chase, Eric.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.909
Great. Now we're talking.

11:17.910 --> 11:19.678
Uh, we hired an SUV.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.179
But from what I've
heard, we'd be mad

11:21.180 --> 11:22.814
to go out west without a guide.

11:22.815 --> 11:23.848
Forget it, buddy.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.183
Shipping out Friday.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.318
Try the Booth brothers.

11:27.319 --> 11:29.321
What if we cut through
Mamuya Valley?

11:32.124 --> 11:33.158
You're joking, right?

11:33.159 --> 11:35.126
Sorry, was I...

11:35.127 --> 11:37.163
talking to the
wrong locals or...

11:38.264 --> 11:40.031
do I have the wrong Rover?

11:40.032 --> 11:43.168
Mamuya Valley is 200 klicks of
nothing but jungle and cliffs.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.804
You can drive around it,
you can fly over it.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.245
If you want, I'll
lend you my shovel,

11:47.246 --> 11:48.566
and you can dig
your way under it.

11:48.590 --> 11:50.619
But no one is going through it.

11:51.377 --> 11:52.945
Somebody already did.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.014
This is a map of an
old service track

11:56.015 --> 11:58.918
used by a 19th century
mining company.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.120
See this trail here?

12:02.121 --> 12:05.090
It leads straight into
the western valley.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.826
Trail that old will
be overgrown by now.

12:07.760 --> 12:08.927
Hard to get a rig through.

12:08.928 --> 12:11.730
Not even with a
little determination?

12:11.731 --> 12:13.099
Maybe with a lot
of determination?

12:14.033 --> 12:16.201
Which makes me wonder, Eric?

12:16.202 --> 12:18.871
What is it you're so
determined to find in Mamuya?

12:22.208 --> 12:25.376
And how determined are you to
make me help you get there?

12:25.377 --> 12:28.147
What do you know
about Stray's Gold?

12:29.849 --> 12:31.183
I got to get back to it, buddy.

12:32.318 --> 12:34.519
Thomas "The Stray" Farrell,

12:34.520 --> 12:38.156
executed during the gold
rushes of the 19th century

12:38.157 --> 12:40.325
for the theft of 200 pounds

12:40.326 --> 12:42.460
of pure gold nuggets.

12:42.461 --> 12:45.196
A haul which he'd buried
that was never found.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.298
His partner, Lawson,

12:47.299 --> 12:50.835
drew a map to the
location of the gold.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.771
But Lawson was shot,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.472
and the map lost for good.

12:54.473 --> 12:57.542
And Stray's mind which
was claimed by Guinness,

12:57.543 --> 12:59.344
then through by the sun.

12:59.345 --> 13:00.812
Only one clue remains.

13:00.813 --> 13:01.980
A symbol.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.215
Senseless but to the
mind of a madman.

13:04.216 --> 13:05.884
Before he succumbed
to the drink,

13:05.885 --> 13:08.153
this Stray was
said to whisper...

13:08.154 --> 13:09.855
"He pays for his deeds..."

13:13.459 --> 13:15.860
"and follows where it leads."

13:15.861 --> 13:18.797
No Rover in the territory who
hasn't heard that story, mate.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.038
Me and Abe must have been to
every corner of this country

13:21.062 --> 13:22.100
looking for that gold.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.903
Now, main guys like you come
around asking about it.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.806
That's the difference
between you and me.

13:27.873 --> 13:29.153
You're looking for an adventure.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.110
I'm looking for a
way out of one.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.945
Best of luck, Eric.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.513
Just one more thing.

13:35.514 --> 13:38.316
Lawson, Stray's partner.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.019
Before he was a miner,
he was a convict.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.420
He arrived on the HMS Blackpool

13:42.421 --> 13:44.255
- in 1834.
- So what?

13:44.256 --> 13:47.559
So he signed a copy of
the ship's register.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.993
I have one here.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.634
I know what Lawson's
signature looks like.

13:50.658 --> 13:52.397
Well then...

13:52.398 --> 13:54.600
you'll recognize it here too.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.004
The Lawson Map.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.275
The missing key to Stray's Gold.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.615
Determination enough for you?

14:11.083 --> 14:13.184
If this map is the real deal,

14:13.185 --> 14:15.153
we split it 50-50
between you and me.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.289
My friend, I apologize
if I haven't been clear.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.025
I'm not interested in the gold.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.895
My quest isn't for riches.

14:23.629 --> 14:25.363
All right.

14:25.364 --> 14:29.068
Why the hell would you want to
go in the middle of nowhere?

14:30.236 --> 14:31.370
Let me show you.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.874
Okay, so remember it's
not finished yet.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.208
Well, it's nowhere
near finished,

14:37.209 --> 14:38.344
but you get the idea.

14:43.582 --> 14:46.551
What if I told you that
progress isn't the solution.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.520
What if I told you that
progress is the pollution.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.257
Is he wearing makeup?

14:55.494 --> 14:58.563
Imagine we're slowly
soaked up by the sun,

14:58.564 --> 15:01.266
forever forgetting we
began here as one.

15:01.267 --> 15:04.636
Humanity's hope lies
in action, not words.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.671
Often this means
defying the herds.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.373
So forget about the media,

15:08.374 --> 15:10.375
set to bolster your fears

15:10.376 --> 15:12.043
and let us tell you a truth

15:12.044 --> 15:13.645
that may bring you to tears.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.648
BP paid a sum, we
called it a fine.

15:16.649 --> 15:19.317
But money won't fix what
is lost for all time.

15:19.318 --> 15:22.420
The Amazon, so beautiful.
Nature...

15:22.421 --> 15:24.155
So this is all just
ripped from YouTube.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.591
I'm trying to get my hands
on some HD versions.

15:26.592 --> 15:29.494
Now listen closely, friends.
This part you can't forget.

15:29.495 --> 15:32.231
Madsen Minerals knows not
the meaning of regret.

15:33.165 --> 15:34.599
This valley so pristine...

15:34.600 --> 15:36.701
Okay, this is what
we're here for.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.270
At exactly 12 p.m. on Tuesday,

15:39.271 --> 15:41.973
Madsen will break ground on
their new mining operation

15:41.974 --> 15:43.007
in Mamuya Valley.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.275
They've offered media passes

15:44.276 --> 15:45.310
to all the news outlets,

15:45.311 --> 15:46.511
but what we wanna do

15:46.512 --> 15:48.112
is come in from the west

15:48.113 --> 15:50.281
and capture what they
don't want people to see.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.084
Madsen Minerals have the worst
environmental disaster record

15:53.085 --> 15:54.218
of all the mining companies.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.321
They've had that
Tony Buxton shill

15:56.322 --> 15:59.190
on the news for weeks pimping
their sustainable practices.

15:59.191 --> 16:00.625
But it's just a bunch of bull.

16:00.626 --> 16:03.261
We're gonna expose the
shit out of them.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.997
Yeah, but how can you write your story
if you don't have your footage yet?

16:05.998 --> 16:07.699
We won't know what we're gonna
get until we get there,

16:07.700 --> 16:09.067
but we'll figure something out.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.169
Hopefully, there'll
be some dead birds

16:11.170 --> 16:12.270
or something.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.438
Dead birds are gold dust.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.440
Worry not, my friends,

16:15.441 --> 16:17.241
of a future dark and strange.

16:17.242 --> 16:19.077
For there is hope for us all

16:19.078 --> 16:21.480
a hope we call change.

16:29.455 --> 16:32.558
Well, Abe, I think you
know what to say.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.193
Fuck this and have a nice day.

16:35.194 --> 16:37.028
- Abey-Baby.
- Nailed it.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.064
I-I know the graphics look
like shit, but I can fix that.

16:40.065 --> 16:42.533
Buzz, we're not
interested in the gold.

16:42.534 --> 16:44.003
That's for you guys.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.371
Our passion is the film.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.074
But it's all for nothing if
we don't get there in time.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.710
So what do you say?

16:54.113 --> 16:55.180
All right, Eric.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.782
This is a business agreement.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.223
All right? You have
something I need.

16:59.224 --> 17:00.624
I can take you where
you need to go.

17:00.648 --> 17:02.253
Don't think for a second...

17:02.254 --> 17:04.388
I'm signing up to
your little crusade.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.023
All right, Scraps, start her up.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.944
And you cover the fuel.
These trucks are thirsty.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.060
Not like your mum's Mazda.

17:09.060 --> 17:10.627
- Yeah.
- Be back here at 6:00.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.663
- Winch up! Winch up!
- We leave at first light.

17:12.664 --> 17:17.169
- What about your truck?
- Keep going. Keep going.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.569
Slowly.

17:19.570 --> 17:21.640
All right, she's about to go.
All right.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.044
Good job!

17:26.045 --> 17:27.178
What about it?

17:27.179 --> 17:29.080
If someone sees us,
word will be out,

17:29.081 --> 17:31.201
and the Ranger will be on our
asses in two hours flat.

17:31.202 --> 17:33.336
It won't matter as long as
we get to the gold first.

17:33.337 --> 17:34.485
Stray's Gold.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.421
The bull that keeps on shitting.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.623
Hey, who's this Ranger
you keep talking about?

17:38.624 --> 17:41.359
- A bounty hunter.
- A bounty hunter.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.493
So what?

17:42.494 --> 17:44.796
We outran Jeff Barrington.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.797
We sure as hell sent the
Ferguson brothers packing.

17:46.821 --> 17:48.366
That was just embarrassing.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.735
I mean, who's dumb enough
to mess with us out here.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.471
Do you know what
happened to Old Jet?

17:53.772 --> 17:56.340
Just two weeks ago,
they found that...

17:56.341 --> 17:58.210
Defender of his
parked by the river.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.845
From what I hear,

18:00.846 --> 18:03.714
they were finding pieces of
him for two straight days.

18:03.715 --> 18:07.385
What the dingos didn't get,
they buried in a plastic bag.

18:07.386 --> 18:09.655
No traces of what happened,
no tracks leading away.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.158
That's the mark of the
Ranger: no marks.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.227
Just blood.

18:16.728 --> 18:18.163
Who does he work for?

18:19.665 --> 18:22.233
Any man with the balls
big enough to ask...

18:22.234 --> 18:24.402
and pockets deep enough to pay.

18:24.403 --> 18:25.536
And he's worth every cent.

18:25.537 --> 18:27.538
Never let a man go
he was paid to keep,

18:27.539 --> 18:28.740
you can be sure of that.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.275
Knowing that the
Ranger's out there,

18:31.276 --> 18:32.878
knowing that you could
be his next job...

18:34.379 --> 18:35.714
keeps us Rovers honest.

18:37.382 --> 18:39.450
I'll get the money, Abe.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.587
With Stray's Gold, I can
pay off every cent I owe.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.123
And if you don't?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.224
If it's not out there?

18:46.225 --> 18:49.694
My problems are just that. Mine.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.797
Gold or no gold, this will
be our last ride together.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.501
The Ranger's
business is with me.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.603
We can help you, Buzz.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.438
If you let us.

19:00.439 --> 19:01.573
We owe you that.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.176
You don't owe me anything.

Don't give me that look.

so afraid of your sexuality.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.891
What does that even mean?

21:33.892 --> 21:36.694
What, you think their faces turn
red when they stare at your ass?

21:36.695 --> 21:37.828
- No, but...
- Don't!

21:37.829 --> 21:39.997
Don't even say it,

No way we're getting
through this, right?

22:41.827 --> 22:43.362
We'll see.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.669
I hope you know this
isn't by choice, okay?

22:51.670 --> 22:53.571
Apparently, things are
about to get rough,

22:53.572 --> 22:55.973

You guys got chops or something?

27:23.323 --> 27:24.174
No.

27:24.175 --> 27:26.043
- Actually, we're, uh...
- Yeah, we're vegans.

27:26.044 --> 27:27.845
You're joking.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.279
All of you? All of
you are vegans?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.215
Oh, well, I'm
actually a raw vegan.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.851
I don't eat anything cooked
above a 118 degrees Fahrenheit.

27:33.852 --> 27:36.572
Oh, there's no meat in this. It's
nothing but beaks, lips, and hooves.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.373
Thank you, Scraps. We,
uh, we brought out own.

27:38.397 --> 27:39.890
Organic, non-GMO.

27:39.891 --> 27:42.860
Organic? What's that
got to do with it? Eh?

27:42.861 --> 27:46.664
Excuse me. That has
everything to do with it.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.426
Don't you guys know that that's the
problem with everything these days.

27:49.450 --> 27:53.704
It's all just a bunch of artificial,
mass-produced, chemical slop.

27:53.705 --> 27:57.908
Look, we, uh, don't condemn
people for their beliefs.

27:57.909 --> 28:00.811
We just made personal
decisions not to be, uh,

28:00.812 --> 28:02.379
barbaric and primitive.

28:02.380 --> 28:03.981
Speaking of which.

28:03.982 --> 28:05.983
Aye, there it is.

28:05.984 --> 28:08.719
This... you wouldn't
have heard of.

28:08.720 --> 28:12.690
Passed down from my family
through generations.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.759
Yeah, it will put
hair on your chest.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.895
Big boy cup.

28:18.396 --> 28:19.431
Want some, mate?

28:20.365 --> 28:21.766
Sure.

28:24.302 --> 28:26.737
Well, what about us?

28:26.738 --> 28:28.373
I'm sorry, you want
a go at Red Dirt?

28:32.077 --> 28:34.411
And why not?

28:34.412 --> 28:38.348
Well, this is what they call
high-performance lubrication.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.784
It's, uh, rated for
approved vehicles only.

28:40.785 --> 28:44.188
Approved by what, odorousness?

28:44.189 --> 28:45.823
It's okay, I don't want one.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.992
No, Tori, you only think
you don't want one.

28:48.993 --> 28:52.129
Because now they have conditioned
us to think that we don't want any.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.498
So, actually, no,
we'll both take one.

28:54.499 --> 28:55.800
Thank you.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.470
- Are you sure?
- Am I sure?

28:59.471 --> 29:02.406
- He asked you.
- And I'm asking you.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.908
Okay, well, do you
want one or not?

29:04.909 --> 29:06.010
Uh...

29:07.245 --> 29:08.879
It's a yes or no question, Tori.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.981
Okay. Yes.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.149
You don't have to.

29:12.150 --> 29:13.517
He says I don't have to.

29:13.518 --> 29:14.953
Oh, my God.

29:16.121 --> 29:17.287
Wow.

29:17.288 --> 29:18.957
Yeah, she's a work in progress.

29:19.891 --> 29:21.291
We could be here all night.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.094
Just give me the damn drinks.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.030
Don't say we didn't warn you.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.535
Well, I'll see you all tomorrow.

29:38.276 --> 29:39.777
Here we are, mate. Cheers.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.813
- What can I get you?
- Can I get a beer, thanks.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.082
Cheat. Don't be cheating.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.151
- I'm out.
- Ah! Huh!

29:47.152 --> 29:48.786
Spinner!

29:48.787 --> 29:51.189
Here you are.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.161
Shit.

29:57.162 --> 29:59.864
Jack! Three wise
men and a turkey!

30:05.270 --> 30:06.337
Now!

30:18.049 --> 30:19.117
Shit!

31:15.440 --> 31:16.907
That's what they called him.

31:16.908 --> 31:19.109
No one knew for sure
what his name was.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.880
Hardly anyone could even
say if they saw his face.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.481
But he was out here.

31:24.482 --> 31:26.049
Living off the land.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.484
Always on the move.

31:27.485 --> 31:30.988
Working here and there
but a slave to no one.

31:30.989 --> 31:33.624
And that's where it all started.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.494
The Wild Dog was the
first of the Rovers.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.529
What happened to him?

31:39.530 --> 31:42.566
Well, he'd be an old man by now.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.269
And the territory out here
is rough as fucking guts,

31:45.270 --> 31:47.504
I mean, even for a
tight crew like us.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.306
But...

31:49.307 --> 31:52.309
I'd still like to think that
he's out here somewhere,

31:52.310 --> 31:54.145
having a new adventure everyday.

31:55.446 --> 31:57.215
At home in the
wind, right, Buzz?

31:58.182 --> 31:59.616
At home in the wind.

31:59.617 --> 32:01.319
Maybe you should
lay on your side.

32:03.621 --> 32:05.188
Oh my God.

32:05.189 --> 32:07.391
Will you be all
right for a while?

32:07.392 --> 32:10.128
Thousands of years
of patriarchy.

32:11.129 --> 32:15.365
Mate, I had a really good
time tonight, but...

32:15.366 --> 32:17.668
sometimes too much of a good
thing can be a bad thing.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.171
I think we should just
pump the brakes, and...

32:21.172 --> 32:22.573
I'll see you tomorrow.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.944
Hey, Scraps, right?

32:26.945 --> 32:28.111
Well, hello.

32:28.112 --> 32:29.646
It talks.

32:29.647 --> 32:33.250
Yeah. Uh... where's the ladies'?

32:33.251 --> 32:35.719
Oh! Yeah, it's, um...

32:35.720 --> 32:37.587
It's just down the
hallway and to the left.

32:37.588 --> 32:39.424
If you fall off a cliff,
you've gone too far.

32:41.426 --> 32:43.193
There is no bathroom, is there?

32:43.194 --> 32:45.495
No, but if you hurry,

32:45.496 --> 32:47.098
you'll be the first
to use the spade.

32:48.032 --> 32:49.100
Awesome.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.637
Enjoy.

32:53.638 --> 32:57.541
Well, we can't keep flooding
our bodies with these poisons

32:57.542 --> 33:01.445
that these corporations have
brainwashed us into thinking we need.

33:01.446 --> 33:04.314
I mean, if only everyone would
just wake up and realize

33:04.315 --> 33:06.617
that we don't need medicine.

33:08.252 --> 33:11.288
I mean, nature provided
all we need to survive.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.124
Well, I think that's
bedtime for me.

33:14.125 --> 33:16.226
You'd know all about that,
wouldn't you, Buzz?

33:16.227 --> 33:20.164
I mean, out here, you just
depend on nature's generosity.

33:21.099 --> 33:22.300
Sure. Whatever.

33:23.234 --> 33:24.335
No?

33:26.604 --> 33:28.271
See, the thing is...

33:28.272 --> 33:29.741
I've been around nature plenty.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.144
It's not just roses
and waterfalls.

33:34.645 --> 33:36.446
Nature hurts.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.215
And it smells.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.584
And it's not given to sympathy.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.520
So...

33:43.521 --> 33:45.690
you say nature provides
all we need to survive,

33:46.724 --> 33:48.458
and that's a joke.

33:48.459 --> 33:51.094
It's nature, mate.

33:51.095 --> 33:52.975
That's the very thing
that's trying to kill you.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.166
I get it.

33:56.167 --> 33:57.602
You think we're naive.

33:58.603 --> 33:59.704
That's fine.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.272
But you know what?

34:02.273 --> 34:03.341
We're a part of something.

34:04.575 --> 34:06.344
Something bigger than ourselves.

34:07.612 --> 34:10.581
And deep down, I think
that's what everybody wants.

34:11.681 --> 34:13.051
Even you.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.552
Just you wait.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.722
One day, you'll find your cause.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.293
Every man needs
something to fight for.

34:23.527 --> 34:25.395
Right.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.531
What's next?

34:47.618 --> 34:50.588
Morning.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.357
It's amazing.

34:54.358 --> 34:56.460
Like something out of a dream.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.862
I'm reminded that
the dream's over.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.430
Back to work, huh?

35:00.431 --> 35:01.566
That's it.

35:03.768 --> 35:06.470
How long have you been out here?

35:06.471 --> 35:08.372
I spent four years and
made it on my own.

35:09.507 --> 35:11.308
There was only a few of
us back then, but...

35:11.309 --> 35:16.146
One day, I found a guy left for
dead in a ditch by some Raiders.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.381
They'd taken his truck.

35:18.382 --> 35:20.702
Figured it'd be useful having
someone owe me a favor, so...

35:21.752 --> 35:23.753
helped him get his truck back.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.157
We've been owing each other
favors for about six years now.

35:27.291 --> 35:28.593
So, ten years.

35:30.361 --> 35:31.462
What made you leave?

35:34.198 --> 35:37.167
Come on, just a tidbit.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.836
A glance behind the mystique.

35:39.837 --> 35:41.339
The mystique, huh?

35:43.541 --> 35:44.909
Well, maybe there is no story.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.180
Maybe I just refused to drive
the road set down for me.

35:51.415 --> 35:54.352
How do you know you're not
carving a road to nowhere?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.488
No role on a road to nowhere.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.758
I just prefer not to
take the highway.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.929
Once I get my hands
on Stray's Gold,

36:05.930 --> 36:07.498
once I clear my debts...

36:08.733 --> 36:10.268
then I can do it all my way.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.737
Then what?

36:13.738 --> 36:15.640
I'm taking suggestions
for a good hobby.

36:18.309 --> 36:20.443
I don't believe you.

36:20.444 --> 36:23.346
If all you wanted was money,
you would have been a banker.

36:23.347 --> 36:24.615
But that was the highway.

36:25.583 --> 36:26.951
You like the backroads.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.587
Oh, my God. Tori!

36:30.588 --> 36:32.256
Well, back to work.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.942
This is where we
started, Mamuya East.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.977
From there it's about 200 klicks

36:53.978 --> 36:55.445
where the mine's supposed to be.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.647
Here.

36:57.582 --> 36:58.683
So where are we?

37:00.952 --> 37:02.819
So we're nearly there.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.322
We're on schedule.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.324
We'll see.

37:07.758 --> 37:09.327
What do you mean?

37:29.547 --> 37:30.815
That's what I mean.

37:33.951 --> 37:35.820
I'm gonna walk it.
You coming up.

37:36.887 --> 37:38.521
Since when is scouting
a two-man job?

37:38.522 --> 37:39.956
Let me say that again,

37:39.957 --> 37:41.292
you're coming up.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.461
- If you say so.
- No, no. Don't. Buzz!

37:44.462 --> 37:46.930
Shit! Get the air dampener!

37:46.931 --> 37:49.267
- Yeah! Fuck yeah!
- That's insane.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.271
I've got a bad
feeling about this!

38:09.754 --> 38:11.922
♪ ♪

38:19.830 --> 38:21.465
Oh!

38:24.502 --> 38:25.535
That's not good.

38:25.536 --> 38:29.072
- Is it in gear?
- -Of course it's in fucking gear.

38:29.073 --> 38:30.473
You blew a tire.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.708
Aw, gee, you think?

38:31.709 --> 38:33.010
- You know what?
- What?

38:34.879 --> 38:36.814
Not worth it. Just stay here.

38:42.420 --> 38:43.754
I have to pee.

38:55.366 --> 38:57.000
Buzz!

38:57.001 --> 38:59.003
Think you better get up here!

39:55.526 --> 39:56.826
How far do you think?

39:56.827 --> 39:58.461
Maybe ten klicks.

39:58.462 --> 40:00.130
It's him, isn't it?

40:00.131 --> 40:01.631
There's no one else it could be.

40:01.632 --> 40:03.312
We've got to get going.
What's the problem?

40:03.336 --> 40:04.667
It's the Ranger.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.804
- The who?
- He's a bounty hunter.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.507
We got two options: outrun
him or pay him off.

40:10.508 --> 40:12.675
Or outrun him long
enough to pay him off.

40:12.676 --> 40:13.843
The gold?

40:13.844 --> 40:14.944
If we can stay in front.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.813
Scraps, how long to
repair the tire?

40:16.814 --> 40:18.582
- Ten minutes.
- You got five.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.654
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

40:25.756 --> 40:26.991
I'll get the jack.

40:28.626 --> 40:29.760
Toolbox.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.603
Oh, the bastard's
cross-threaded.

40:40.604 --> 40:41.672
Come on!

40:44.809 --> 40:45.942
Shit. Reverse the pin.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.912
Abe, Phillips head screwdriver.

40:52.716 --> 40:55.553
She's coming! She's coming!
She's...

40:58.022 --> 40:59.689
All right! Fourth one's loose!

40:59.690 --> 41:00.724
Last one.

41:03.994 --> 41:05.529
Go ahead! Back her up!

41:17.842 --> 41:19.143
All right.

41:21.078 --> 41:23.481
Buzz, it's shifting. Get
yourself up against it, mate.

41:27.017 --> 41:29.920
Almost there. All
right, it's off.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.126
- Don't pretend it's easy. Get in here!
- All right, now.

41:37.127 --> 41:39.496
Where's Skye?

41:39.497 --> 41:40.830
I don't know.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.832
She was here a minute ago.

41:42.833 --> 41:43.968
Oh, fuck.

41:44.969 --> 41:48.171
Skye!

41:48.172 --> 41:49.506
Skye!

41:49.507 --> 41:50.774
Skye!

41:51.909 --> 41:54.077
- Abe, how long we got?
- You said you saw her.

41:54.078 --> 41:56.179
- Forty-five!
- -She was here a minute ago.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.680
Forty-five seconds. Come on!

41:57.681 --> 41:58.883
Skye!

42:03.621 --> 42:06.056
- All right, 30 seconds, come on.
- There!

42:07.625 --> 42:09.693
All right. Tighten 'em
up and let's move it!

42:11.962 --> 42:13.831
- Skye!
- All right, that's it.

42:25.242 --> 42:27.744
Let's move!

42:27.745 --> 42:30.213
The rest of you, follow
me up the hill now!

42:30.214 --> 42:32.082
- Come on. Let's go!
- Skye!

42:44.161 --> 42:45.262
Skye!

42:51.135 --> 42:52.936
Bring her right up!

42:52.937 --> 42:54.337
Hold it there!

42:54.338 --> 42:56.340
- Got the controller?
- Yeah.

43:02.813 --> 43:03.981
Power up!

44:01.739 --> 44:03.641
Stand clear! Winch it!

44:05.676 --> 44:07.845
Yep. Yep.

44:09.647 --> 44:11.682
All right, she's about to flip.

44:24.194 --> 44:25.728
Keep it going.

44:25.729 --> 44:27.164
Come on!

44:39.276 --> 44:40.310
Shit.

44:49.119 --> 44:51.387
Buzz, what are you doing?
Let's go.

44:51.388 --> 44:53.256
No way. No way he
gets over that.

44:53.257 --> 44:55.324
Not without a winch point.

44:55.325 --> 44:58.262
Come on. Come on,
you old bastard.

45:01.432 --> 45:03.132
Damn it!

45:03.133 --> 45:04.468
All right, get in the truck!

45:06.270 --> 45:08.939
Everybody, get in the tray!
Find something to hold on to!

45:12.242 --> 45:14.311
Scraps, what are you waiting for!
Come on!

45:19.850 --> 45:20.884
Go!

45:21.885 --> 45:23.087
Scraps!

45:31.895 --> 45:33.463
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

45:33.464 --> 45:35.799
Hold on.

46:00.991 --> 46:02.860
- What are you doing?
- Tourist drive.

46:09.266 --> 46:10.334
Jesus!

46:32.189 --> 46:33.290
Skye!

46:44.001 --> 46:45.335
Hey, Skye!

46:47.938 --> 46:48.972
Skye!

46:54.211 --> 46:55.379
Are you okay?

47:00.217 --> 47:01.251
Okay.

47:02.186 --> 47:04.354
Up we... get!

47:09.126 --> 47:11.086
Well, this is lovely and
all, but what's the plan?

47:12.362 --> 47:14.064
- There.
- What?

47:23.507 --> 47:25.667
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
He'll be right on us.

47:33.083 --> 47:34.117
Go!

47:48.465 --> 47:50.900
Where are you going?
Scraps is back that way.

47:50.901 --> 47:53.069
He'll be expecting that.

47:53.070 --> 47:54.371
Wanna get one step ahead.

48:05.482 --> 48:07.516
Okay...

48:07.517 --> 48:09.619
Let's get rid of that.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.120
Hey, Skye. Hey!

48:11.121 --> 48:12.455
Look at me.

48:12.456 --> 48:14.658
You have to stay awake. Skye!

48:22.900 --> 48:24.301
- What happened?
- It's okay.

48:25.602 --> 48:27.203
Where are the others?

48:27.204 --> 48:28.638
You have to be quiet.

48:28.639 --> 48:30.679
Don't tell me to keep quiet.
I asked you a question.

48:30.703 --> 48:32.041
He's gonna come
back for us, okay.

48:32.042 --> 48:34.210
If Buzz escapes, he's
gonna come back for us.

48:34.211 --> 48:35.312
Who will come back for us?

48:36.546 --> 48:37.915
The Ranger.

48:39.516 --> 48:40.683
I want Tori.

48:40.684 --> 48:42.518
- Where is Tori?
- She's with the others.

48:42.519 --> 48:44.053
Okay, let's go find the others.

48:44.054 --> 48:45.121
Skye, stop.

48:45.122 --> 48:46.402
What, you think I can't navigate

48:46.403 --> 48:47.483
my way through a few ferns.

48:47.507 --> 48:48.424
Oh, let me guess.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.159
You have a superior
sense of direction.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.360
- Skye.
- What?

48:51.361 --> 48:53.530
Shut... up.

48:56.633 --> 48:59.469
Why is this happening?
Where are the others?

49:01.238 --> 49:03.205
Why does my face hurt so much?

49:03.206 --> 49:05.274
It's okay, okay? We-We'll
stay to the forest.

49:05.275 --> 49:07.043
We-We'll stay low
and stay quiet.

49:07.044 --> 49:08.377
Yeah, but what if he
comes back for us.

49:08.378 --> 49:10.112
That's right. Buzz
will come back for us.

49:10.113 --> 49:12.048
No, the Ranger. You said
he'll come back for us.

49:12.049 --> 49:14.150
Okay, well, look.

49:14.151 --> 49:16.151
Why don't you think about
happy thoughts, you know,

49:16.152 --> 49:18.352
like, happy thoughts like
thinking about things you like

49:18.376 --> 49:20.323
and what kind of movies
do you like, you know.

49:20.324 --> 49:22.692
You make them, don't you? You're,
like, talented and shit.

49:22.693 --> 49:24.261
Yeah, I've made a few.

49:25.295 --> 49:26.530
What were they about?

49:28.332 --> 49:29.892
Well, there was this
one called "Float."

49:29.916 --> 49:30.967
It's about a cloud.

49:30.968 --> 49:32.635
A cloud.

49:32.636 --> 49:36.138
Like a "cloud" cloud.
Like, in the...

49:36.139 --> 49:37.340
Lets you fly...

49:37.341 --> 49:39.008
So what does it do?

49:39.009 --> 49:41.077
Nothing, it just floated there.

49:41.078 --> 49:42.479
For 30 minutes.

49:44.114 --> 49:46.215
Yeah, but does it
rain or something?

49:46.216 --> 49:49.318
It's not some Hollywood
action film, okay.

49:49.319 --> 49:51.620
It's an observational piece.

49:51.621 --> 49:53.255
I love clouds.

49:53.256 --> 49:55.691
They're so careless and light.

49:55.692 --> 49:57.626
Just floating.

49:57.627 --> 50:01.364
But this one cloud, it starts to
drift away from the other clouds.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.333
So slowly that you'd
barely notice

50:04.334 --> 50:06.502
if you weren't really
paying attention.

50:06.503 --> 50:09.005
And... it was kind of sad,

50:09.006 --> 50:11.173
you know, this one cloud...

50:11.174 --> 50:13.010
just drifting all
the way by itself.

50:16.113 --> 50:17.647
I know it's stupid.

50:18.715 --> 50:20.049
This cloud, was it big?

50:20.050 --> 50:21.717
Was it bigger than
the other clouds?

50:21.718 --> 50:23.552
Yeah, I guess.

50:23.553 --> 50:25.055
Do you think that maybe...

50:26.056 --> 50:28.357
the cloud felt like
it was dragging

50:28.358 --> 50:30.459
the other clouds down, like...

50:30.460 --> 50:33.529
maybe it was too big and slow?

50:33.530 --> 50:37.167
Maybe it felt like it wasn't good
enough for the other clouds?

50:39.369 --> 50:42.204
What the fuck are you talking about?
It's a cloud.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.374
Right.

50:46.209 --> 50:48.577
Okay, we gotta get
away from the road.

50:48.578 --> 50:50.147
Go! Go, go, go go! Go, go!

51:04.761 --> 51:06.362
How did it go?

51:06.363 --> 51:08.631
Cleared the tracks.
Covered the entryway.

51:08.632 --> 51:09.698
It will do for now.

51:09.699 --> 51:11.634
We better be out at first light.

51:11.635 --> 51:13.569
First light? What about Skye?

51:13.570 --> 51:15.471
You're gonna leave them out
here with that psychopath?

51:15.472 --> 51:17.792
That's our man out there too, mate.
We don't have a choice.

51:17.793 --> 51:20.713
Our best bet is to lie low for the night.
Make a run for it in the morning.

51:20.737 --> 51:23.379
It's a long way back. Wouldn't
want to miss our deadline.

51:23.380 --> 51:26.020
- If we punch it, we can get there
by mid-afternoon. - Unacceptable.

51:26.044 --> 51:27.416
We need to be there by noon,

51:27.417 --> 51:29.686
not a minute later, or this
has all been for nothing.

51:34.791 --> 51:36.125
What if we do leave them?

51:36.126 --> 51:37.760
What?

51:37.761 --> 51:39.528
They've got provisions
in the trucks,

51:39.529 --> 51:42.198
and Scraps knows
the forest, right?

51:42.199 --> 51:44.700
We'll be back here in 36 hours.

51:44.701 --> 51:47.603
Tell me they can't
survive 36 hours

51:47.604 --> 51:49.271
and I'll drop it right now.

51:49.272 --> 51:52.241
They won't survive 36
seconds against the Ranger.

51:52.242 --> 51:54.577
You said it yourself. The
Ranger's after Buzz.

51:54.578 --> 51:57.646
The further we go, the more distance
between them and the Ranger.

51:57.647 --> 51:59.649
What's so important about
getting there at 12:00?

52:01.118 --> 52:03.385
The blasting's at 12:00.

52:03.386 --> 52:04.854
It's the most important
piece of the footage.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.815
It's gonna be hard to get
footage when your camera

52:06.839 --> 52:08.257
is back up the hill
in the cruiser.

52:08.258 --> 52:10.338
Not to mention the fact
you're missing your director.

52:11.361 --> 52:12.562
Give me your phone. Phone.

52:13.497 --> 52:16.398
Cameraphone. And Skye...

52:16.399 --> 52:18.701
she'd want this
more than anything.

52:18.702 --> 52:21.137
Now, come on. We are this close.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.905
Let's not go back now.

52:22.906 --> 52:24.406
I say we take a vote.

52:24.407 --> 52:26.475
I vote that at first light,

52:26.476 --> 52:27.843
we make our way to the mine,

52:27.844 --> 52:30.246
we get the footage we need,

52:30.247 --> 52:32.482
and we're back here in 36
hours to pick up the others.

52:35.719 --> 52:37.520
Two.

52:37.521 --> 52:39.322
Well, we know what your vote is.

52:40.824 --> 52:41.824
Tori, what's yours?

52:46.229 --> 52:48.898
Well, I can see both
sides of the argument.

52:48.899 --> 52:50.633
I mean, it would be a
shame if all of this

52:50.634 --> 52:52.201
was for nothing.

52:52.202 --> 52:56.705
But then leaving Skye and
Scraps to fend for themselves,

52:56.706 --> 52:58.607
I don't think that I could
ever forgive myself

52:58.608 --> 53:00.008
if something were
to happen to them.

53:00.032 --> 53:02.811
So what's your vote, Tori?

53:02.812 --> 53:04.513
You really gonna make me vote?

53:04.514 --> 53:05.649
You're the tiebreaker.

53:06.650 --> 53:07.883
But what if I'm wrong?

53:07.884 --> 53:10.487
You won't be wrong if
you just do what I say.

53:11.755 --> 53:13.923
Come on, Tori. We don't
have all bloody day.

53:13.924 --> 53:16.258
Well, I don't want to
be the tiebreaker,

53:16.259 --> 53:18.827
and I vote not to
be the tiebreaker.

53:18.828 --> 53:20.663
You can't vote not to
be the tiebreaker.

53:20.664 --> 53:23.199
Fine. Then I vote not to vote.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.668
- And I vote that voting is stupid.
- I second that vote.

53:25.669 --> 53:28.438
And I vote that everyone
should just leave me alone!

53:33.910 --> 53:35.578
- Well...
- Okay,

53:35.579 --> 53:38.214
we'll be safe on the other side,

53:38.215 --> 53:39.575
until the others
get back at least.

53:39.599 --> 53:41.417
Yeah, and when will
they get back?

53:41.418 --> 53:42.452
Soon.

53:43.386 --> 53:44.453
All right,

53:44.454 --> 53:45.888
hop on.

53:45.889 --> 53:46.923
What?

53:47.857 --> 53:49.225
I'm gonna carry you across.

53:49.226 --> 53:51.328
Why? Why would you
carry me across?

53:52.596 --> 53:55.264
- Well, because you're, um...
- Because I'm...

53:55.265 --> 53:57.366
- You know?
- Apparently, I don't know.

53:57.367 --> 53:59.568
- Well, I'm, uh...
- Okay.

53:59.569 --> 54:00.889
Hey, hey, hey, what
are you doing?

54:00.913 --> 54:02.238
Just like a man.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.906
Think all women
need to be carried.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.808
You know, we have all the
Ellen Ripleys and...

54:05.809 --> 54:07.810
and Buffys and Joan Jetts gone?

54:07.811 --> 54:09.545
Those are my role models.

54:09.546 --> 54:12.348
I wasn't trying to make like a
political statement or anything.

54:12.349 --> 54:14.516
It just make bugger-all
sense that we both get wet

54:14.517 --> 54:15.717
when I could have carried you.

54:15.741 --> 54:16.719
You don't understand.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.254
I don't want you to
carry me across.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.022
All that would do
is just reinforce

54:20.023 --> 54:21.624
your idea of male domination...

54:21.625 --> 54:23.460
Oh, my God! What
the fuck is that?

54:26.263 --> 54:27.430
It's a stick.

54:28.965 --> 54:31.367
It's called unconscious bias.

54:31.368 --> 54:32.569
I'm not even aware of it.

54:33.570 --> 54:35.638
- Oh.
- Okay. Fine.

54:35.639 --> 54:37.506
- I get it.
- Don't pander to me.

54:37.507 --> 54:39.275
God, you're such an asshole.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.916
But you know what, it
doesn't even matter.

54:40.940 --> 54:43.846
Once I've fought and fucked
and swear my way to freedom,

54:43.847 --> 54:46.048
you're gonna realize that
it's not us that needs you,

54:46.049 --> 54:47.984
it's you that needs us.

54:49.586 --> 54:50.620
I'm stuck.

54:54.491 --> 54:58.295
I'm trying not to reinforce
unconscious bias.

54:59.829 --> 55:02.398
You don't have to be
so stupid about it.

55:02.399 --> 55:03.632
What about surfing?

55:03.633 --> 55:04.967
Surfing?

55:04.968 --> 55:07.670
Yeah, why not. It's free,

55:07.671 --> 55:10.739
keeps you cool in the summer, you get
to hang around chicks in bikinis.

55:10.740 --> 55:11.940
We have to say something.

55:11.941 --> 55:15.944
Devote you life to protesting
combustion engines.

55:15.945 --> 55:17.980
- Eric?
- 100 perfect organic.

55:17.981 --> 55:19.515
Raw vegan food.

55:19.516 --> 55:20.749
We have to do something.

55:20.750 --> 55:22.819
Transsexual bandits?

55:26.823 --> 55:28.625
Scraps?

55:30.093 --> 55:31.428
Scraps?

55:59.889 --> 56:01.358
He's not in there.

56:02.726 --> 56:04.860
But he's around.

56:04.861 --> 56:07.021
What does he want with us? I
thought he was after Buzz.

56:07.045 --> 56:08.914
Buzz is a slippery
tiger on the trails.

56:10.400 --> 56:11.568
I want you to stay here.

56:12.569 --> 56:13.837
When you hear that start...

56:14.971 --> 56:16.072
you get in.

56:17.006 --> 56:18.775
What? Are you fucking crazy?

56:40.730 --> 56:43.767
Okay, what have we got here?

56:48.905 --> 56:50.573
Come on, come on.

56:52.842 --> 56:53.877
All right.

56:57.013 --> 56:59.015
I am fucking crazy.

57:02.786 --> 57:04.721
Come on. On your horse.
Gallop away.

57:21.037 --> 57:22.071
Come on. Come on.

57:27.577 --> 57:29.946
Come on. Come on. Drive faster.

57:34.484 --> 57:35.685
Come on. Come on. Come on.

58:16.092 --> 58:18.728
I'm sorry I didn't
support your vote.

58:19.896 --> 58:21.930
It's okay.

58:21.931 --> 58:23.967
It's just that I
can see his face.

58:25.068 --> 58:26.802
I know that I'll have
to see him soon,

58:26.803 --> 58:28.570
and I'm scared, Eric.

58:28.571 --> 58:29.739
I know it's hard.

58:30.673 --> 58:32.542
Doubt can be our worst enemy.

58:38.214 --> 58:40.048
Is it him?

58:40.049 --> 58:41.184
Is it the Ranger?

58:42.719 --> 58:43.753
No.

59:17.921 --> 59:18.954
Buzz!

59:18.955 --> 59:22.291
Look, the valley slopes
down into this trench.

59:22.292 --> 59:23.859
Now unless there's a bridge,

59:23.860 --> 59:26.194
the-the-the truck has
to curve northeast

59:26.195 --> 59:27.596
before it makes to
the descent here.

59:27.597 --> 59:29.197
So if we fan out north
through this shit,

59:29.221 --> 59:31.181
- we might be able to...
- Cut them off! Let's go!

59:49.786 --> 59:50.987
I've got this.

59:53.222 --> 59:54.256
How long?

59:54.257 --> 59:55.592
Three minutes.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.701
I'm trying to decide
whether I owe you

01:00:05.702 --> 01:00:08.904
an apology or not.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.806
On the one hand, I know
you must be angry.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:15.344
Scared even. And I do
feel bad about that.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.065
But on the other hand,
I can't help but feel

01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:18.780
I'm just as much of a
victim as you are.

01:00:18.781 --> 01:00:21.950
So I guess the
question really is,

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:24.253
if I did apologize,
would it even matter?

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.125
Huh? I wanna show you something.

01:00:32.328 --> 01:00:35.030
Victoria Madsen,

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:37.299
rich daughter of a
powerful businessman

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.102
turned environmental activist.

01:00:40.103 --> 01:00:42.104
I mean, if clichés
could rule the world,

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.740
you'd be our messiah.

01:00:44.674 --> 01:00:46.675
But they don't.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.745
You know what rules
the world, Tori?

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.114
A good story.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.716
I used to think it was
things like facts,

01:00:54.717 --> 01:00:57.719
education, public discussion,
intellectual debate.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.356
But for every one fact, the
corporations have three lies,

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:05.662
and no one has the education
to tell the difference.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.930
So we're standing here

01:01:08.931 --> 01:01:11.867
watching the planet being
destroyed before our eyes,

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:14.102
and we think what?

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:15.905
We should make a documentary?

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:28.951
The daughter of a
billionaire mining magnate

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:32.722
destroys his latest creation.

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:39.895
Intrigue, family
drama, human interest,

01:01:39.896 --> 01:01:42.065
the media will lap it up.

01:01:43.099 --> 01:01:45.768
Change starts with a good story.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.205
And you, Tori,

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.307
are my story.

01:01:52.308 --> 01:01:55.844
Now exactly four hours from now,
your father plans to detonate

01:01:55.845 --> 01:01:58.313
two million pounds
of ammonium nitrate

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.015
under the surface of the Earth.

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:02.185
Stopping him won't make
a difference, you know?

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:05.088
I'm not just going to stop him.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.824
I'm gonna make him pay.

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:10.759
There's 200 million
dollars' worth

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.960
of shiny new mining equipment

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.129
standing by in a compound.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:16.098
Tom's gonna redirect the signal

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:19.468
from their charge to our
explosives in the compound

01:02:19.469 --> 01:02:21.104
Eric, people could get killed.

01:02:22.338 --> 01:02:24.506
That would be awful.

01:02:24.507 --> 01:02:27.342
The guilt would be
almost too much to bear.

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:28.911
But that's what I'm saying...

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.115
I'm a victim here too.

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.252
All right, we're clear.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:39.856
Let's go.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.835
There it is.

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:55.036
Do you think we beat them?

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.538
We beat them all right.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:57.874
You know what to do?

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:05.448
Perfect.

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.971
- Look out!
- Fuck!

01:03:31.374 --> 01:03:32.508
Shit.

01:03:46.422 --> 01:03:47.490
Woo-hee!

01:03:53.396 --> 01:03:55.297
Good day, mate.

01:03:55.298 --> 01:03:57.065
Impossible.

01:03:57.066 --> 01:04:00.502
You can count me
impressed, Buzz.

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:04.072
Lucky for us, Scraps turned up
with a cruiser after you left.

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:08.109
Unlucky for you, Abe keeps a
couple of rifles in the back.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.246
Abe and Scraps have got you
in their sights right now.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.948
So...

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.983
this is how it's gonna go.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.318
You're gonna stay right here.

01:04:16.319 --> 01:04:17.953
We'll leave you some supplies.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.888
You give us Tori and
when we get some range,

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:21.769
we'll call a rescue chopper
to come pick you up.

01:04:21.793 --> 01:04:22.924
How gracious of you.

01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.626
So I understand,

01:04:24.627 --> 01:04:28.230
if we don't throw our
arms up and surrender,

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:31.166
you're going to spray
us with bullets?

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.534
That's right.

01:04:32.535 --> 01:04:34.202
What about Tori?

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:37.372
You'd risk her life
with that threat too?

01:04:37.373 --> 01:04:39.374
No better shot in
the world than Abe.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.176
So Tori's okay then?

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.879
Safe and sound, right?

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:45.914
If you care about her, mate...

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.382
you'll let her go.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:48.618
Right now.

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:52.153
See...

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.955
there it is.

01:04:53.956 --> 01:04:55.324
I'm curious.

01:04:56.325 --> 01:04:58.226
If the boys do have the rifles,

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:00.262
that means you outnumber us.

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:04.165
You could have just pulled us
over at the side of the road.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.501
Would have been far simpler.

01:05:06.602 --> 01:05:07.904
Well, what can I say,

01:05:08.971 --> 01:05:10.105
I'm theatrical.

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.539
I can see that.

01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:15.210
But I'm thinking this
might be a one-man show.

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:17.579
- You see, I can't
imagine how hard...

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.481
it must have been for
you to get here.

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:21.116
All that time and energy,

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:23.919
those bumps, bruises, cuts.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.320
And all for what?

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:26.955
Someone else's gain.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:28.457
This is a rescue mission.

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:32.295
There's a righteous
man in there, Buzz.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:34.664
I was right all along.

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.134
You and I aren't so different.

01:05:39.201 --> 01:05:41.203
You really want to risk
your life on that?

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.239
We can get over this tree.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.609
A bit of effort but,
uh, it can be done.

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:51.180
Go back to looking
after yourself.

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.550
It's what you do best, right?

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.722
- Tori!
- Where are you going, babe?

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.305
We're leaving. Now! Get in.

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:22.645
Come on.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.174
Let me get this straight.

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:55.510
You lot are the same nutjobs

01:06:55.511 --> 01:06:58.246
been blowing up mines all over
the world the last few months?

01:06:58.247 --> 01:07:00.648
No, not Skye. She had
nothing to do with it.

01:07:00.649 --> 01:07:03.618
They just needed her for
the cover story, and...

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.699
Well, they want to blame the
whole thing on me, so...

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:11.393
You have to believe me.

01:07:11.394 --> 01:07:12.428
Why you?

01:07:13.596 --> 01:07:14.764
What's so special about you?

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.503
I am Daniel Madsen's daughter.

01:07:23.105 --> 01:07:25.273
- Fuck!
- So,

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:27.308
Princess Jasmine hops
on her flying carpet,

01:07:27.309 --> 01:07:29.511
signs up with Captain
Planet and the Planeteers

01:07:29.512 --> 01:07:32.180
so she can stick the
finger at Darth Vader, eh?

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.416
That doesn't make any sense.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.817
All right, here's the situation.

01:07:35.818 --> 01:07:37.786
We got no food,

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:40.622
no transport, no
phone, no radio,

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.263
the nearest town's a
thousand klicks away,

01:07:42.287 --> 01:07:43.607
and the Ranger's
hot on our heels.

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:46.429
- But...
- But what?

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.165
I thought you were working
your way up to something.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.406
You know, like a plan. Didn't it sound like
he was working his way up to something?

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.602
All right, here's the plan.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:57.239
Part one: we're fucked.

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.341
End of plan.

01:08:27.169 --> 01:08:28.370
What do we do?

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.607
Get ready to run.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.745
♪ ♪

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.292
What the fuck?

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:07.843
♪ ♪

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:14.917
Right.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:19.622
You two better kiss me
real good later on.

01:09:22.625 --> 01:09:23.758
Where are the others?

01:09:23.759 --> 01:09:25.794
I don't even know
where to start.

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:34.868
So what now?

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.438
We go ahead with the plan.

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.774
The plan was to pin the
whole thing on Tori.

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:43.845
Without her, we're just a couple
of assholes with pipe bombs.

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:45.880
We won't even make
the blogosphere.

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:47.515
You can forget about prime time.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.352
We were only going to make
three pipe bombs, right?

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:53.421
But we have more ammonia.

01:09:53.421 --> 01:09:57.292
How many bombs could you make
and detonate at the same time?

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:58.927
Enough to level the place.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.195
That wasn't the plan.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:04.732
The plan... is to
make Madsen pay.

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:08.537
Tori or no Tori, we didn't
come all this way for nothing.

01:10:10.873 --> 01:10:11.941
You with me?

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.276
I'm with you.

01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:22.317
You're joking.

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:24.519
Makes you think, eh?

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.555
Maybe deep down, he's just
a bloody normal bloke.

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:38.834
Maybe not.

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.657
Found some.

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.893
- Find anything in here?
- Nothing interesting.

01:11:38.894 --> 01:11:40.662
We're not gonna last
long without some food.

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.398
We have to make a move
while we have light.

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:45.601
We have something for you.

01:11:47.803 --> 01:11:49.637
We have to go after them.

01:11:49.638 --> 01:11:51.039
Go after who?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.907
Were you not listening
to what I said before?

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.043
Oh, geez, it's never enough
with you lot, is it?

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.545
I mean, who are the bad
guys supposed to be here?

01:11:57.546 --> 01:11:59.013
It is not that simple.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.815
- They have a two-hour headstart.
- Hey!

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.317
Even if we did catch
up with them,

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:06.754
Right now, you need to be thinking
about food and water, nothing else.

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:09.624
Look, my father's company has
done some terrible things,

01:12:09.625 --> 01:12:11.105
and they have to pay
for that one day,

01:12:11.129 --> 01:12:13.428
but I don't think that my
father's behind it all.

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.630
There's... There's this
lobbyist Tony Buxton.

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:19.400
No, my father said that he had
the Australian government

01:12:19.401 --> 01:12:21.469
wrapped around his
finger, and he...

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:24.639
He made exemptions and
conditions or something.

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:26.474
Like what?

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.009
Like...

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:31.946
I don't know. He does stuff.
He...

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:34.615
He lies about the effects of
mining on the environment

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:36.776
so the public don't really
understand what's happening.

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:37.785
What kinda lies?

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:41.422
Like toxic waste storage

01:12:41.423 --> 01:12:43.458
and profits, corporate
profits and...

01:12:43.459 --> 01:12:45.027
I just... I...

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:49.764
- I don't like his face.
- What?

01:12:49.765 --> 01:12:51.933
I know he's bad, all right.
He has this...

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:52.967
face.

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:54.536
And you don't like it.

01:12:55.504 --> 01:12:57.439
No, I don't.

01:12:58.507 --> 01:12:59.974
Noted.

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:02.510
But Abe's right. There's nothing
we can do about that now.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.791
But we're not going home either.

01:13:03.815 --> 01:13:04.982
What?

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:07.782
We're going after Stray's Gold.

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:11.152
Buzz. We got lucky. We got
the upper hand for once.

01:13:11.153 --> 01:13:13.233
Let's just take the rig and
get the hell out of here.

01:13:13.257 --> 01:13:15.156
And then what? I spend
the next 20 years

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.791
driving rich pricks
around the city.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.092
No, mate.

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.395
I came roving for one reason:

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:22.164
Stray's Gold.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:29.171
Shut up, the both of you!

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.517
I see right through
you, you know?

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.719
You'd be best to turn
yourself around right now.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:47.188
You act like you don't
care, but the truth is,

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:49.190
you're just scared to
take responsibility.

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:51.058
Responsibility for what exactly?

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.660
For everything.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.662
Can't you see the world
is falling apart?

01:13:54.663 --> 01:13:57.064
That's the whole point, girlie. The
world's going to shit no matter what.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:59.545
Best we can do is hold on to some
bargaining chips when it does.

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:00.868
- Don't do that.
- What?

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:03.037
Try and distract me
with that whole sexy,

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:05.039
lone-wolf, Australian shtick.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:06.073
What?

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:07.141
You know what I mean?

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:09.444
- Shtick?
- Don't...

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.212
do it.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:14.182
Anyway, you choose to do it
rough because you're afraid

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.117
that if you tried, you
could make a difference.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:18.487
Bloody hell, give it a rest here.
Hold this.

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.622
Think you know me so well.

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.103
Let me tell you what
I know about you.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.561
You don't give a shit
about the environment.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:30.998
When really, this is just about
you sticking it to your dad.

01:14:30.999 --> 01:14:33.167
And hey, that's fine.

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:36.137
You have to come up with
something a lot better

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.972
than "I don't like his face."

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.208
What are you...

01:14:41.109 --> 01:14:42.144
Oh, my God.

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.146
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.515
I'm so sorry.

01:14:55.023 --> 01:14:56.558
Half a million dollars.

01:14:57.559 --> 01:14:58.660
What?

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.664
That's the reward my
father's offering.

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:06.667
You know, I wonder
about that number.

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.169
What, I'm not worth
a cool million.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.705
He probably had a meeting
with his accountant about it.

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:13.976
You know, there is this whole
other life I could have had.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:20.548
"Refusing to drive only the
road set down for you."

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:23.217
Well, one day, I woke
up and I realized,

01:15:23.218 --> 01:15:25.020
my path had been
laid down for me.

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.155
Hello?

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:30.259
- I'm listening.
- Oh. Well...

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.928
Skye and Eric, they
showed me a new road.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:35.630
One with meaning and purpose

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:37.932
and something that
was bigger than me.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.868
Can't you understand
that at all?

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:44.872
The truth is, I don't know if I
could have ever gone through

01:15:44.873 --> 01:15:48.075
I just wanted to be
able to tell him,

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:51.079
you know, that I am... I'm
not one of his projects.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.615
The point is...

01:15:54.616 --> 01:15:56.183
I know I'm fucked up.

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:58.853
I don't know who I am
or who I wanna be,

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.290
but for once, I'm
sure of something.

01:16:02.224 --> 01:16:03.825
We have to stop Eric.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.131
That's not my problem.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:12.099
I know it is not your problem,

01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.768
but would it really be so bad

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:15.329
to be part of something
greater than you

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:16.955
for once in your life?

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:20.943
God damn it.

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:30.851
So we about ready to go or what?

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.054
She's a stout rig.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.723
Thirty-five claws.

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:37.091
Front and real lockers.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.192
Plenty of clearance.

01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:39.962
- What's your point?
- Come on, Abe.

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.631
We're this close. I can feel it.

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:45.700
Just give me one last shot.

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.035
Yeah, we can do this.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:50.638
Here's what's gonna happen.

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:52.206
We all get in the FJ,

01:16:52.207 --> 01:16:54.308
we head back for our rigs,

01:16:54.309 --> 01:16:56.378
and Scraps fixes them up.

01:16:58.614 --> 01:16:59.914
That's how it is, is it?

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.015
That's how it is.

01:17:01.016 --> 01:17:02.651
Ooh!

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:04.753
Buzz...

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:07.756
we've been roving for six years.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:10.184
I'm not gonna let
you kill yourself

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:11.776
with some bullshit story.

01:17:12.861 --> 01:17:15.229
Years have got nothing
to do with it.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:17.866
You get in the truck,
you hit the road.

01:17:19.134 --> 01:17:21.335
Either way, never forget...

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:23.404
I don't need you.

01:17:23.405 --> 01:17:26.307
Maybe you should go back to getting
your ass spanked in the army.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.742
Look like you could
use a few weeks

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.378
drinking margaritas by the pool.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.782
- Stop!
- Don't! Stop!

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:36.084
Stop it, it's a fake.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.721
It's fake.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:43.391
We needed your help, so I added
the signature to an old map.

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.059
The map is real.

01:17:45.060 --> 01:17:46.500
I-I stole it from
my father's office,

01:17:46.524 --> 01:17:47.892
but...

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:51.365
There is no gold.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:53.000
Well, what do you know.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:54.302
I was right.

01:18:13.789 --> 01:18:14.923
Stop it!

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:24.099
Come on.

01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:31.173
What do you want from me, Abe?

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.808
Go fuck yourself, Buzz.

01:18:33.809 --> 01:18:36.777
What do I owe you?

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:37.913
Nothing.

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:44.786
Phil!

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:47.322
Phil Demarco!

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.731
Abe.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.033
Yeah, um...

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:01.168
He always wanted to
be the first in.

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:03.004
He always wanted to
take the credit.

01:19:04.139 --> 01:19:06.408
So one second, he's got
this dumbass smile.

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:09.077
He takes a step...

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.080
and it's gone.

01:19:16.752 --> 01:19:19.153
General put us on rec
leave in the Green Zone.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.355
Twenty Johnnies just sitting
around for two weeks

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.824
waiting for the
next one to blow.

01:19:23.825 --> 01:19:25.160
Sipping margaritas by the pool.

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:29.331
Actually beer.

01:19:30.866 --> 01:19:33.234
So about a year
after I got home,

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:36.003
I had a fight with this
chick I was seeing.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:39.341
Next thing I know,
she's running from me.

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.146
Took me a long time
to figure out why.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:47.607
Got all my cash out of the
bank went to a used car lot,

01:19:47.631 --> 01:19:49.250
brought a rustbucket
old cruiser,

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.484
and I just kept driving.

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:54.322
Out the city, out the sticks
till I hit the territory.

01:19:56.391 --> 01:19:58.826
Out where they don't ask
you where you come from

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.129
or what you done.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.434
I'm never going back, Buzz.

01:20:09.070 --> 01:20:11.106
Roving's all that's left for me.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.217
You know, maybe you
don't need friends,

01:20:23.218 --> 01:20:25.119
maybe you can handle it alone.

01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:27.087
But it doesn't
make you hardcore.

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.523
It makes you pathetic.

01:20:35.964 --> 01:20:37.531
What are you doing?

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:38.999
- Stop it!
- Buzz! Buzz!

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.569
- Let me go.
- Buzz, what's going on?

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.438
Get in that truck.

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:47.241
- Don't move!
- Hey!

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:50.245
Whoa, Buzz, steady on, mate.

01:20:53.081 --> 01:20:54.582
- Guys!
- Buzz!

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:56.083
Buzz, mate, what's going on?

01:20:56.084 --> 01:20:57.451
What am I missing here, mate?

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:59.186
I'm gonna get you out.

01:20:59.187 --> 01:21:01.055
Buzz! Buzz.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:02.122
Give me your hands.

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:03.591
Why are you doing this?

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:06.293
Someday, you're gonna have to
face up to your father, Tori.

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.595
The reward?

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:09.231
Someone's gonna claim it, right?

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.635
Might as well be me.

01:21:15.003 --> 01:21:16.103
Buzz, come on, mate.

01:21:16.104 --> 01:21:17.172
Why are you doing this?

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:32.419
Abe, what happened?

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:34.889
Buzz is Buzz, that's
what happened?

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:38.158
Okay, well, what now? Can we
walk to the mine instead?

01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.460
Twenty klicks,

01:21:39.461 --> 01:21:41.528
one bottle of water
between three people,

01:21:41.529 --> 01:21:42.897
in this heat.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.365
Don't worry, Buzz
will come back.

01:21:44.366 --> 01:21:45.500
He always does.

01:21:46.635 --> 01:21:48.003
Hey, guys.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.639
Will that help?

01:21:56.978 --> 01:21:59.013
What's a mine cart
doing out here?

01:21:59.014 --> 01:22:00.348
Must be from the old mine.

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.584
Reckon it still works.

01:22:21.236 --> 01:22:23.305
You might want to
hang on to something.

01:24:40.241 --> 01:24:42.710
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hold it!

01:24:43.745 --> 01:24:45.313
This is a restricted area.

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.418
I said hold it!

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:56.391
I wanna talk to Daniel Madsen.

01:25:27.322 --> 01:25:28.388
Everything all right here?

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.724
Uh, nothing to
worry about, Dave.

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:33.360
Eighteen minutes till showtime.

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.463
Wait in here. He'll
be a few minutes.

01:25:51.212 --> 01:25:52.280
Cheer up.

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.349
Hard part's over.

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:56.783
Roper wants to have a chat.

01:25:56.784 --> 01:25:59.287
Tell him five. I gotta
take care of something.

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.814
My daughter.

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:31.825
There's nothing to
worry about, okay.

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:34.789
- Dad, I...
- No apologies.

01:26:36.224 --> 01:26:37.524
No explanation.

01:26:37.525 --> 01:26:39.226
We have a long flight
ahead of us tomorrow.

01:26:39.227 --> 01:26:40.295
We can talk then.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.500
Daniel...

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:47.835
Madsen.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.238
Buzz.

01:26:51.673 --> 01:26:53.753
Thank you, Buzz, for bringing
my daughter back to me.

01:26:56.844 --> 01:26:58.512
Dan, she's five minutes out.

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:01.982
Here, take Tori and get her
something to eat and drink.

01:27:01.983 --> 01:27:03.283
All right, sure thing.

01:27:03.284 --> 01:27:04.585
I'll be five minutes.

01:27:04.586 --> 01:27:06.186
- I need to take care of something.
- Dad.

01:27:06.210 --> 01:27:07.821
It's gonna be all
right, sweetie.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.390
I'll see you in a
minute, all right.

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:21.768
So, you are a bounty hunter,

01:27:21.769 --> 01:27:23.637
or mercenary?

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.540
Just a Rover, mate.

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:29.910
Australian stuff ain't bad.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.012
Gets the job done.

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:38.720
So... how did you hear
about the reward?

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:42.456
Just got lucky, I guess.

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:45.359
I'm aware it seems
unlike a father's love.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:47.327
But it's love alone
that motivates me.

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:51.431
Love for the future that I
worked hard to create for them.

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:52.500
You understand?

01:27:53.468 --> 01:27:55.469
Is that what you need from me?

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.504
Understanding?

01:27:58.640 --> 01:27:59.807
Guess not.

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:04.679
What I need is discretion.

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:07.048
I won't be talking to anyone.

01:28:08.316 --> 01:28:10.550
There is something you
should know, though.

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:14.289
Does the name "Free Earth
Group" mean anything to you?

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.436
So I've got a baby in one arm,

01:28:29.437 --> 01:28:31.038
a bottle of mouthwash
in the other.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:33.440
Scrubs, shut up for one minute.

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:34.841
- Don't touch me.
- Oh, fine.

01:28:34.842 --> 01:28:38.979
That mine cart took us
about 15 klicks west.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.315
Straight down into the
western foothills.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:42.796
We should be pretty
close to the mine.

01:28:45.653 --> 01:28:46.953
Oh, yeah.

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:48.022
That didn't take long.

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:51.526
There's the Ranger's rig.

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:54.461
So Buzz is here.

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.897
- We should go find him.
- Hold up.

01:28:57.732 --> 01:28:59.433
The detonation crew
looks pretty busy.

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:01.735
Must be still going
ahead with the blast.

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.016
Yeah, but Buzz and
Tori are here.

01:29:03.017 --> 01:29:04.584
They should have warned
them about Eric.

01:29:04.585 --> 01:29:05.707
Wait.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.545
Security picked them up.

01:29:11.546 --> 01:29:13.647
They flat-tired them
all the way out here.

01:29:13.648 --> 01:29:15.482
All right, you two...

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.119
Get the rigs patched
up and ready to go.

01:29:19.354 --> 01:29:20.588
I'll be bringing some friends.

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.824
All right, let's do it.

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.112
These mickeys are gonna
be worth a mint.

01:29:45.113 --> 01:29:46.414
Oi!

01:29:47.148 --> 01:29:51.051
Just a bit of salvage on the
side, Mac, no big deal.

01:29:51.052 --> 01:29:53.333
We found them on a long range
perimeter run in the valley.

01:29:53.357 --> 01:29:55.555
This is a clear zone.

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.791
Nobody's supposed to be
here during the blast.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:29:59.927
So get out of here,
you two mongrels.

01:30:01.796 --> 01:30:04.564
Sector 3 has been cleared.

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.601
Yeah, apparently, they have
a very elaborate plan.

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:09.169
You know what to do.

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.004
So...

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:13.140
Let me get this straight.

01:30:13.141 --> 01:30:15.675
You let these
eco-fucksticks con you

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:18.679
by telling you a story
about a buried treasure.

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:21.654
Sometimes it's hard to
tell the difference

01:30:21.678 --> 01:30:22.846
between what you believe...

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.052
and what you want to believe.

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:30.425
Come here. I wanna
show you something.

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:32.859
This is what we're building.

01:30:32.860 --> 01:30:35.429
Now where we're standing
here is just the beginning.

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:38.632
Using maps and documents
from an old mining company

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:41.034
that was here over a
hundred years ago,

01:30:41.035 --> 01:30:43.870
we were able to discover a
whole underground network

01:30:43.871 --> 01:30:46.807
of old mines connected
by this rail cart.

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:49.476
My prospectors have found
evidence of deposits

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:51.945
that we can exploit for decades.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.214
We are building the
most advanced goldmine

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:55.982
the world has ever seen.

01:30:55.983 --> 01:30:58.653
And it's completely sustainable.

01:30:59.954 --> 01:31:01.189
Lot of dead birds, huh?

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:03.591
Definitely not.

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.727
So about that reward...

01:31:09.063 --> 01:31:11.164
You looking for work, Buzz.

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:12.566
You don't wanna give me a job.

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.468
We could really use you.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:16.503
Someone who knows the country.

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:17.972
Someone with half a brain.

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:20.575
I'm not a good employee.

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:23.643
Let me tell you something, Buzz.

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.612
I have built an empire.

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:29.616
I have achieved more than I had
ever hoped or dreamed I would.

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:30.917
But you know what?

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:32.752
I feel like I'm just
getting started.

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.956
Because you always
have to move forward.

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.726
You always have to
have a mission.

01:31:40.828 --> 01:31:42.497
So what kind of job
are we talking about?

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.267
That's Mamuya Valley.

01:31:47.268 --> 01:31:49.603
The Mamuya Export Terminal.

01:31:49.604 --> 01:31:53.006
This is essential to the
success of the operation.

01:31:53.007 --> 01:31:55.942
Now I need somebody to
head up a security team

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:57.844
to keep all those damn activists

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:00.214
and anybody with a camera
out of my business.

01:32:01.215 --> 01:32:03.817
It will be off the
books initially

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.820
until we can get full
official approval.

01:32:06.754 --> 01:32:07.822
Freeway?

01:32:09.023 --> 01:32:10.056
Through Mamuya?

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.691
Yeah, well, initially,

01:32:11.692 --> 01:32:14.561
we're gonna be traveling north
on the central highway.

01:32:14.562 --> 01:32:18.265
But in the long run, it's
gonna be much easier.

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:20.901
I tell you what, Buzz. I have
some things I need to do.

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:23.837
Stay a while. Help
yourself to a beer.

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:26.758
And I want you to think about what
you're really gonna do with that reward.

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:50.564
Milady.

01:32:50.565 --> 01:32:51.565
Shut up, asshole.

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.603
You're late.

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.238
- Late?
- Blasting's in seven minutes.

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.319
Well then, I'd say we're
right on time, wouldn't you?

01:33:00.343 --> 01:33:01.207
Nice velor.

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:03.009
Glad you like it.
One for you too.

01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:04.177
Cheers.

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:06.713
What is this? Australian
national uniform?

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:07.949
Safety first.

01:33:09.016 --> 01:33:11.284
- How was your trip?
- It was great.

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:13.020
I loved the dirt and...

01:33:14.088 --> 01:33:15.922
Well, that's pretty
much all there was.

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:19.259
There could have been a
terrorist attack for all I know

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.700
or a stock market crash, and I'm
out here missing all the fun.

01:33:21.724 --> 01:33:23.063
Trust me, Roth.

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:25.184
There's no better place for
you to be than right here.

01:33:25.933 --> 01:33:27.867
Anyway, all you gotta
do is sit back,

01:33:27.868 --> 01:33:30.271
roll the camera, and watch the
story of the year happen in...

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:32.773
exactly six minutes.

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:34.875
Follow me.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.728
Detonation in T
minus two minutes

01:33:54.729 --> 01:33:55.895
and 30 seconds.

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.163
Here you go, mate.

01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.398
This is my daughter Tori.

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.933
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:01.068
Hey, Tori.

01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:04.405
Best seats in the house.

01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:08.708
Is it done?

01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:09.910
We're in place.

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.712
Did you block the signal?

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.648
Redirected the transmission.

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:15.849
When I flip the switch,

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:17.751
they're gonna have one
hell of a surprise.

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:18.919
How long?

01:34:26.127 --> 01:34:27.695
It's the two-minute warning.

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.302
Stand by for arming

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:38.739
in three, two, one.

01:34:44.278 --> 01:34:45.379
Okay.

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:52.118
Come on, look at this with me.

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:53.154
Make Daddy proud.

01:34:56.290 --> 01:34:57.857
Detonation on my mark.

01:34:57.858 --> 01:35:01.728
Ten. Nine. Eight.

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:04.864
Seven. Six. Five.

01:35:04.865 --> 01:35:07.434
Four. Three.

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:10.738
Two. One. Mark.

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:20.981
What happened?

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.951
What?

01:35:27.288 --> 01:35:28.321
Activist!

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:30.223
Quick. He's got the detonator.

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:31.925
I'm on it.

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:34.166
It's all active. They just
haven't pushed the button yet.

01:35:34.190 --> 01:35:35.225
Let's see.

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:37.798
Damn Rovers.

01:35:39.967 --> 01:35:42.035
Mac, what the hell is going on?

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.237
Someone took the detonator.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.740
Well, get it back now!

01:35:46.741 --> 01:35:48.041
Do you have a description?

01:35:48.042 --> 01:35:49.509
White shirt and black vest.

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:52.079
Copy that. All units, we're
on security lockdown.

01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:22.469
It's the symbol.

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:30.277
The symbol is the map.

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:32.478
He pays for his deeds.

01:37:32.479 --> 01:37:34.215
And follows where it leads.

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:41.921
What gives you the
right to Stray's Gold?

01:37:41.922 --> 01:37:44.558
I gave up a life of comfort,
and I took the risk of roving.

01:37:46.861 --> 01:37:49.128
What else is there?

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:50.964
I've been searching
for Stray's Gold

01:37:50.965 --> 01:37:52.433
for nigh on 40 years.

01:37:54.635 --> 01:37:56.270
And now that it's there...

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.273
right there for the taking...

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:02.910
you know what I feel?

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.580
Surprise.

01:38:16.891 --> 01:38:19.260
It's been decades since
I last thought of it.

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:22.263
And even back in
the beginning...

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:26.032
before the roving
turned to running

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.600
and running turned to killing,

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:30.270
even then deep down

01:38:30.271 --> 01:38:32.172
I didn't really believe
it was out there.

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:38.112
I just needed something.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.649
Something to keep me going.

01:38:45.185 --> 01:38:47.021
Something to accompany
the silence.

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:52.226
Wild Dog?

01:39:06.307 --> 01:39:07.408
Listen up.

01:39:08.509 --> 01:39:10.944
We got the warehouse surrounded.

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:13.212
Now you give us back
those detonators

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:14.481
and nobody will get hurt.

01:39:38.372 --> 01:39:39.707
Come on, let's go after them!

01:39:42.676 --> 01:39:44.143
We are in pursuit

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:46.112
of activist driving
a red Land Rover

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.981
on the northeast corner.

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:51.284
All LV units, please report
to the northeast corner.

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:53.052
Right-o, we're on our way.

01:39:53.053 --> 01:39:54.621
We are on our way.

01:39:57.291 --> 01:39:58.592
What the hell is going on?

01:40:05.599 --> 01:40:07.567
Scraps, how you going?

01:40:07.568 --> 01:40:10.203
Yeah, I'm balls deep in Madsen
Rent-A-Cops at the moment, mate.

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:12.006
All right, keep them busy.

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:24.184
Abe! Give it to me!

01:40:38.198 --> 01:40:39.333
Give me that detonator.

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:42.736
Shit!

01:41:14.701 --> 01:41:16.103
Hey!

01:41:25.712 --> 01:41:26.780
Hey, mate.

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:33.287
Put it down!

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.156
Oh, you wanna be a hero now.

01:41:37.157 --> 01:41:39.459
You're just a pawn, Abe.

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:41.427
- Remember?
- Oh, yeah, well, what are you?

01:41:41.428 --> 01:41:42.695
Where's Eric, eh?

01:41:42.696 --> 01:41:44.565
Where's your... king?

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.734
Eh, you're right.
We're both pawns.

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.370
And Eric is the king.

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.506
But who's the player?

01:41:53.507 --> 01:41:55.609
Who's got us exactly
where he wants us?

01:41:57.544 --> 01:41:58.612
Madsen.

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:01.415
Tell you what.

01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:06.678
I'm not being paid enough to
stare down the barrel of a gun.

01:42:06.702 --> 01:42:08.337
You want the truth?

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:11.658
Either way, he wins.

01:42:13.193 --> 01:42:14.761
Just walk away.

01:42:24.771 --> 01:42:25.839
Hey!

01:42:29.176 --> 01:42:30.377
Bloody activist.

01:42:40.587 --> 01:42:41.755
I was shoveling shit.

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:44.391
Anything's better than this.

01:42:45.526 --> 01:42:47.193
I suppose it's in there.

01:42:47.194 --> 01:42:48.629
All right.

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:51.264
What the hell is taking so long?

01:42:51.265 --> 01:42:52.900
We're boxing him in now.

01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:58.605
Think we're running out
of luck, sorry, mate.

01:43:00.874 --> 01:43:02.309
Bullshit.

01:43:05.646 --> 01:43:07.581
I could go to a day spa.

01:43:09.616 --> 01:43:11.217
I'm gonna get a mani-pedi.

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:14.321
I'm gonna get me some
motherfucking chocolate.

01:43:20.494 --> 01:43:21.827
Come on! Come get some!

01:43:21.828 --> 01:43:26.332
Eric and Madsen both think they
can profit from the story.

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:27.853
We need to make sure
there is no story.

01:43:27.877 --> 01:43:29.302
Why? This has nothing
to do with us.

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.903
We just happen to be
in the middle, mate.

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.372
- Is this all of it?
- Yeah.

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:34.974
Good. Let's go.

01:43:34.975 --> 01:43:36.876
Granite incline near the
south gate is pretty hairy.

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:39.077
- They won't be able to follow us.
- Where are you going?

01:43:39.078 --> 01:43:40.438
I've got to take
care of something.

01:43:40.462 --> 01:43:41.564
Buzz!

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:47.254
- You're a dickhead.
- You're right.

01:43:48.322 --> 01:43:49.602
How about you come up and drive,

01:43:49.603 --> 01:43:50.637
and I'll shoot the gun.

01:43:50.638 --> 01:43:51.758
Hold it steady for me.

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.663
Jesus! Learn how to drive.

01:43:57.664 --> 01:43:58.832
Sorry.

01:44:05.539 --> 01:44:06.873
Groovy, motherfucker.

01:44:08.742 --> 01:44:11.344
Scraps, there's a parallel
track about half a klick

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:13.379
east of the security compound.
You seeing it?

01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.540
I think so, but I don't know
if we'll make it that far.

01:44:15.564 --> 01:44:17.766
That's your only chance.
Bring him to me. Haul ass.

01:44:21.989 --> 01:44:23.623
Oh, shit!

01:44:23.624 --> 01:44:25.024
These guys just ran
me off the road.

01:44:25.048 --> 01:44:26.626
Well, hurry it up.

01:44:26.627 --> 01:44:28.294
You're making us
look like idiots.

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:30.329
We're supposed to
look like victims.

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:31.465
Victims?

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:33.833
What are you talking about?

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.701
Nothing, sweetie.
It's-It's fine.

01:44:35.702 --> 01:44:37.271
Dad, what is going on?

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:39.039
Tori...

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:41.341
why aren't you getting it?

01:44:42.309 --> 01:44:43.677
You don't have to worry.

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:46.779
I'll take on that
burden for you.

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.614
You knew.

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.383
- Buzz.
- You knew they were coming,

01:44:50.384 --> 01:44:52.018
and you were gonna
do nothing about it.

01:44:52.019 --> 01:44:56.055
Buzz, go back inside, and I'll
see you in a few with a check.

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:57.976
He thinks if he can make
himself look the victim,

01:44:57.977 --> 01:44:59.897
he can paint all his critics
with the same brush.

01:44:59.921 --> 01:45:00.893
What?

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:02.295
Switching sides, Buzz?

01:45:02.296 --> 01:45:03.629
Nah.

01:45:03.630 --> 01:45:05.765
I'm staying right where I
am, in the same corner.

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.433
You knew.

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:10.436
In Brazil and South Africa,
you let those people die?

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.537
- Tori...
- No!

01:45:11.538 --> 01:45:13.873
Don't tell me not
to think about it.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:16.042
I know that I am not
the perfect daughter

01:45:16.043 --> 01:45:17.610
that you wanted me to be and...

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.879
maybe I'm not even a very
good activist either.

01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:20.946
But you know what?

01:45:20.947 --> 01:45:22.448
Making decisions should be hard,

01:45:22.449 --> 01:45:24.617
so you and Eric can go
and fuck yourselves.

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.385
All right.

01:45:26.386 --> 01:45:28.688
And you, caring about
the environment

01:45:28.689 --> 01:45:31.490
does not make me some
self-flagellating ideologue.

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.993
At least I am doing
something and not just...

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:36.462
moping around like some
sexy, wandering loner.

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.583
Why do you keep saying that?

01:45:37.607 --> 01:45:38.764
So what if helping people

01:45:38.765 --> 01:45:40.466
makes me feel better
about myself.

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:42.027
At least I admit that
I am full of shit.

01:45:42.051 --> 01:45:44.003
But you are more full
of shit than anyone,

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.371
Mister-I-Don't-Need-Friends.

01:45:45.372 --> 01:45:47.106
You're an asshole,
and I hate you.

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:50.042
This place is an abomination, and
I'm gonna protect Mamuya Valley.

01:45:50.043 --> 01:45:51.578
You're the sexiest man alive.

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:05.392
You got, like, a
curfew or anything?

01:46:07.728 --> 01:46:08.929
I'll use protection.

01:46:11.631 --> 01:46:12.799
Care to comment, Daniel?

01:46:13.967 --> 01:46:15.635
Somebody get me a damn update.

01:46:28.815 --> 01:46:30.384
Come on.

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:56.843
Nice day, boys.

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:05.786
Guards are clear, Abe. Blow it.

01:47:23.437 --> 01:47:25.604
You're joking.

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:27.006
Mac, what happened?

01:47:27.007 --> 01:47:28.841
Did anyone get hurt?

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.043
Everybody's okay.

01:47:30.977 --> 01:47:32.479
They blew up an LV.

01:47:36.983 --> 01:47:38.752
Abe, what's the going, mate?

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:42.889
Head to the south gate.

01:47:44.057 --> 01:47:45.759
Buzz says there's an exit there.

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:51.163
Well, this has been fun, but
I think it's time we go.

01:47:51.164 --> 01:47:52.765
Go? You can't go.

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:54.166
What about the story?

01:47:54.167 --> 01:47:55.668
The eco-terrorist?

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:56.836
Yeah, it's great stuff.

01:47:56.837 --> 01:47:58.637
I'll have Sasha type
it up on his blog.

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.873
Oh. Yeah, walkoftruth.net.

01:48:00.874 --> 01:48:02.208
What are you talking about?

01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:04.076
This is a national story.

01:48:04.077 --> 01:48:08.113
Got an explosion in the bush, a
few bruised security guards.

01:48:08.114 --> 01:48:10.516
"Story" is barely an anecdote.

01:48:10.517 --> 01:48:12.685
Next time you have a
tip for me, save it.

01:48:12.686 --> 01:48:14.955
Unless it's in Bali
or Fiji or something.

01:48:16.756 --> 01:48:18.090
And remember,

01:48:18.091 --> 01:48:19.859
it's dot net,

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:20.961
not dot com.

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.116
You didn't finish your job.

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:51.791
Last vehicle, second row.
The money's inside.

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:57.830
You know, it doesn't matter
who dragged her here.

01:48:57.831 --> 01:48:59.566
She'll be gone either way.

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:02.035
You know that, right?

01:49:15.849 --> 01:49:18.684
We're not going
anywhere without Tori.

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.753
Abe, what's the
going here, mate?

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:22.955
I don't know. Buzz said
he'd meet us here.

01:49:22.956 --> 01:49:24.256
Well, what if he doesn't show?

01:49:24.257 --> 01:49:25.724
- I don't know.
- Whoa,

01:49:25.725 --> 01:49:27.226
wait up...

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:28.661
We're right behind you.

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:29.982
Can't have a Toyota
and Land Rover

01:49:30.006 --> 01:49:31.730
heading boost without
a recovery vehicle.

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:33.900
Just give Scraps some direction.

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:37.136
That's it!

01:49:37.137 --> 01:49:38.605
It's right in front of you.

01:49:43.810 --> 01:49:45.778
Here you are. Whoa!

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:46.980
I'll get the winch out.

01:50:07.734 --> 01:50:09.235
Anything I could do to help?

01:50:10.203 --> 01:50:11.638
Put that through there.

01:50:13.940 --> 01:50:16.610
Pin through the eye. Thread it the
whole way, half a click back.

01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:25.117
All right, it's attached.
Start her up.

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.885
Where's Tori?

01:50:26.886 --> 01:50:28.220
She's up there helping me.

01:50:28.221 --> 01:50:29.823
Buzz!

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.228
Put the gun down, Eric.

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:38.064
See, Buzz, I was
right, wasn't it?

01:50:39.199 --> 01:50:42.167
Courage, fortitude,

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:43.937
self-sacrifice,

01:50:44.904 --> 01:50:46.372
and all for a cause.

01:50:46.373 --> 01:50:48.340
Feels good, doesn't it?

01:50:48.341 --> 01:50:50.310
Gives you a sense of purpose.

01:50:53.847 --> 01:50:55.180
The thing is, Buzz.

01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:57.250
Your cause was me.

01:50:58.918 --> 01:51:03.023
Your cause was ruining
everything I worked for.

01:51:11.731 --> 01:51:13.832
I hope it feels good, Buzz.

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.801
I hope it gives you a deep,

01:51:15.802 --> 01:51:18.904
and abiding sense of purpose.

01:51:18.905 --> 01:51:20.345
There's nothing to
feel bad at, mate.

01:51:22.375 --> 01:51:23.743
I just don't like your face.

01:51:24.678 --> 01:51:25.712
Now!

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:32.852
Oh, my God.

01:51:38.892 --> 01:51:39.993
Come here.

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:44.697
Hey, Bugalugs.

01:51:44.698 --> 01:51:46.231
- Told you we'd be back, didn't I?
- Are you okay?

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:47.299
What's next, boss?

01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:49.235
Let's get the rigs
moving and get...

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.205
Oh, shit.

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.446
Let's get this up the hill. Now.

01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:55.974
- Hey, Abe, get in the GQ.
- What?

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:58.144
- Why?
- Hello, handsome.

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.747
Okay, chief, you wanna
give that one to me?

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:04.416
Why? You think the gun's too
heavy for a little girl?

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:07.220
No, you can clearly handle it.
I just... I want it back.

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:09.956
No, I think I'll hold on to it.

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.025
Okay.

01:52:32.445 --> 01:52:34.913
So, what happened to
the cloud in the end?

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.448
Fuck off.

01:52:36.449 --> 01:52:38.117
What, I liked it.

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:42.889
Okay. Well, you can't leave a guy hanging.
It was such a good setup.

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:46.191
Here.

01:52:46.192 --> 01:52:47.960
Here.

01:52:47.961 --> 01:52:49.762
- Here.
- Buzz, what is this?

01:52:49.763 --> 01:52:50.864
And how about here.

01:52:51.798 --> 01:52:53.166
Now join them up.

01:52:55.935 --> 01:52:58.036
They must have split
the map into two.

01:52:58.037 --> 01:53:00.406
Boss's map leads into the...

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:06.311
These are all points
on the rail tunnel.

01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:07.346
All except this one.

01:53:07.347 --> 01:53:09.182
What's that one?

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.085
It can't be.

01:53:13.086 --> 01:53:14.453
He pays for his deeds.

01:53:14.454 --> 01:53:16.856
- Don't say it.
- And follows where it leads.

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:18.925
Left or right?

01:53:19.993 --> 01:53:21.094
Umm...

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.229
left.

01:53:31.304 --> 01:53:33.572
Okay, okay. If this is
right, the gold is buried

01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:35.474
at the top of that mountain.

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:36.842
This just keeps getting better.

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:38.545
Punch it! Punch it!

01:53:39.813 --> 01:53:40.880
Get around him!

01:54:13.379 --> 01:54:15.314
Where to now?

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:17.150
Okay, take the track
on the right.

01:54:21.588 --> 01:54:23.255
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:24.591
You got this.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:28.328
Buzz!

01:54:33.466 --> 01:54:35.200
Right, I said. Right!

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:36.936
Buzz, what are you doing?

01:54:46.646 --> 01:54:48.014
There's a cliff ahead.

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:54.988
- Fuck it!
- There's a cliff ahead.

01:56:00.353 --> 01:56:01.521
Say...

01:56:02.655 --> 01:56:03.723
Phil?

01:56:06.326 --> 01:56:08.094
It's short for Filippo.

01:56:10.330 --> 01:56:11.631
I really prefer Abe.

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:14.701
So do I.

01:56:16.336 --> 01:56:17.537
Chris.

01:56:20.974 --> 01:56:22.008
Chris Burrows.

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:27.380
Burrows?

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:29.482
Buzz.

01:56:30.984 --> 01:56:32.424
Something my friends
used to call me.

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:41.159
Well, Chris...

01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:42.640
I bet that career job
back in the city

01:56:42.664 --> 01:56:44.997
is looking pretty
good right about now.

01:56:44.998 --> 01:56:46.132
Well...

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:48.234
maybe I'll hold off.

01:56:49.435 --> 01:56:51.204
Can't think of a decent
hobby yet anyway.

01:56:52.271 --> 01:56:53.773
So, it's definitely
no to the golf.

01:56:54.707 --> 01:56:56.308
Too Scottish.

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:57.676
I'm not stamp collecting either.

01:56:57.677 --> 01:56:59.312
Just roving.

01:57:00.246 --> 01:57:01.513
Just roving.

01:57:01.514 --> 01:57:03.715
I should tell you, I
really can't wait

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:05.417
to see this shitbox go.

01:57:05.418 --> 01:57:07.252
- What.
- Do you know how much time we waste

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:09.121
just keeping this bloody
thing from falling apart?

01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:10.402
Some respect for the dead, mate.

01:57:10.426 --> 01:57:12.026
We're still sitting
in it, for chrissake.

01:57:12.625 --> 01:57:14.060
Is that princess?

01:57:15.305 --> 01:57:21.779
