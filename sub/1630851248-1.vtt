WEBVTT

00:21.646 --> 00:22.647
- Shh!
- Shh-shh!

00:22.780 --> 00:23.915
Shh!

03:43.382 --> 03:46.017
I don't give a flying fuck
if he's occupied.

03:46.151 --> 03:49.221
Out of my way, Toodles.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.589
Should I call security,
Minister?

03:50.723 --> 03:52.725
Do that.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.526
Tell them they're fired.

03:56.295 --> 04:00.199
How's redundancy
treating you, Kylie?

04:00.332 --> 04:02.768
I've been keeping busy.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.936
I have a file for you to watch.

04:05.069 --> 04:07.172
Collected surveillance.

04:07.306 --> 04:10.309
Improbable, I'm a busy man.

04:11.143 --> 04:13.312
Congratulations on
your landslide re-election,

04:13.445 --> 04:14.112
by the way.

04:17.850 --> 04:19.752
Minister?

04:19.884 --> 04:21.153
Assistant Commissioner,

04:21.286 --> 04:23.255
don't tell me
you're back with her.

04:23.389 --> 04:26.725
Oh, no, Joseph's my plus one.

04:26.859 --> 04:29.228
I've already briefed him
via text.

04:34.999 --> 04:38.936
Electronic surveillance
and decrypted caches.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.640
Apparently,
she's created a timeline.

04:44.343 --> 04:46.145
Must've been
quite an undertaking,

04:46.278 --> 04:48.447
especially without
official clearance.

04:48.580 --> 04:49.615
It was.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.417
It's not quite a timeline,
though.

04:51.550 --> 04:53.918
I've shuffled some events
and fast-forwarded

04:54.051 --> 04:56.255
to heighten the drama.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.740
All right,
the infamous bookshop.

05:14.873 --> 05:16.107
As Conrad's case officer,

05:16.241 --> 05:17.476
I requested that the premises

05:17.609 --> 05:21.280
be put under special crimes
AMBER surveillance.

05:21.413 --> 05:24.081
- AMBER?
- No eyeballs watching it,

05:24.216 --> 05:25.983
automated surveillance,

05:26.117 --> 05:28.854
archived but not monitored.

05:28.986 --> 05:30.955
Diaries kept by a machine.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.089
You authorize that?

05:32.224 --> 05:35.059
Departmental protocol.

05:35.194 --> 05:38.464
It wasn't required
that I was informed.

05:38.597 --> 05:41.433
It's just your standard
residential bundle.

05:41.567 --> 05:44.001
Audio visuals
in living quarters,

05:44.136 --> 05:46.238
in-wall microphones,
cameras concealed,

05:46.371 --> 05:48.740
and the smoke detectors
in the television.

05:50.342 --> 05:52.644
This shop floor footage,
on the other hand,

05:52.778 --> 05:54.546
we didn't install.

05:54.680 --> 05:57.114
It dated back
to the previous tenants,

05:57.249 --> 05:59.083
supposed to be disconnected.

05:59.218 --> 06:01.018
Surprise bonus!

06:01.320 --> 06:02.754
You might want
to pull up a chair,

06:02.888 --> 06:04.121
Assistant Commissioner.

06:04.289 --> 06:06.325
Let him stand.

06:10.462 --> 06:12.063
So what am I looking at here?

06:17.101 --> 06:18.337
The girlfriend.

06:23.342 --> 06:26.278
That's her brother, Stevie.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.185
And that's Conrad Verloc.

06:33.318 --> 06:35.521
All right, enough
with the running commentary.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.083
Stevie!

07:08.085 --> 07:10.188
Stevie, freeze.

07:10.322 --> 07:12.190
And unfreeze.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.898
Did you know we have
a two-for-one special

07:20.032 --> 07:23.902
- on shemale titles?
- I'll just take that one.

07:24.036 --> 07:26.305
That'll be $20 then.

07:36.481 --> 07:38.584
Ten cents for the paper bag.

07:43.689 --> 07:45.089
Thank you!

07:45.223 --> 07:47.159
Come again!

07:48.560 --> 07:50.462
Buy a book, why don't you?

08:02.341 --> 08:08.046
We're here
in the natural environment

08:08.180 --> 08:12.017
of the enigmatic Winnie.

08:12.150 --> 08:17.322
The Winnie is a social animal,

08:17.456 --> 08:23.328
monogamous,
and highly territorial.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.467
Wait!

08:28.600 --> 08:32.604
I think I see one now.

08:34.373 --> 08:39.443
We must be careful
not to startle her.

08:39.578 --> 08:45.617
The female is the deadliest
of the species.

09:07.806 --> 09:10.375
Remember what
we used to do in bed?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.944
Not on this grubby rug.

09:13.078 --> 09:16.149
It'll be better, more electric.

09:16.281 --> 09:18.316
Come on, please?

09:23.055 --> 09:24.322
All right, well, be quick.

09:24.456 --> 09:26.458
I wanna see his faxing.

09:39.271 --> 09:40.706
Legs?

09:40.839 --> 09:42.674
Up into my thighs.

09:42.808 --> 09:44.676
Tingling spine?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.311
Lower back.

09:46.445 --> 09:49.081
Going up.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.084
- Neck!
- Neck.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.719
You win.

09:53.852 --> 09:55.020
Up you get.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.538
Hey! Hey!

10:13.672 --> 10:16.675
Someone called Vladimir wants
to fund a G20 protest.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.582
You think he's Antifa?

10:25.951 --> 10:27.319
Could be.

10:29.222 --> 10:30.856
Have you memorized the address?

10:43.835 --> 10:45.437
Hey, you can't just
turn it off like that,

10:45.570 --> 10:46.972
it's a valve amp!

10:47.105 --> 10:48.907
Shall we meet with him tomorrow?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.912
It's addressed to me,
so I'll go in the morning.

10:54.045 --> 10:55.781
How does that sound?

10:59.651 --> 11:01.920
And don't just
turn it back on like...

11:02.053 --> 11:04.289
Don't, what'd I...

11:14.833 --> 11:17.502
In this tutorial,
I'm going to show you

11:17.636 --> 11:20.705
how to recycle
old video cassettes.

11:21.573 --> 11:24.709
Nobody wants videos anymore.

11:24.843 --> 11:30.249
You can find them for free
or buy them for 50 cents.

11:30.382 --> 11:33.318
Never pay more than a dollar.

11:34.820 --> 11:38.857
Take the cassette
out of its box.

11:40.559 --> 11:43.762
Do you see
this square hole here?

11:44.329 --> 11:48.667
If this tab has been broken off,

11:48.800 --> 11:53.172
the film cannot be taped over.

11:53.306 --> 11:54.973
But...

12:00.812 --> 12:09.054
Now the tape can be recycled
for use in other ways.

12:09.188 --> 12:13.458
I'll be using this one
to continue my monitoring

12:13.592 --> 12:16.661
of the human species
in captivity.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.217
Check one, two.

14:18.351 --> 14:20.319
Check one, two.

14:32.231 --> 14:34.433
So you got my fax then?

14:34.566 --> 14:37.303
Genius idea that, a fax revival.

14:37.436 --> 14:38.970
What's your budget?

14:39.104 --> 14:41.973
Straight to the point,
very good.

14:42.741 --> 14:46.111
Enough to buy a cure,
not just a prevention.

14:46.245 --> 14:49.114
A Black Bloc of the G20.

14:49.248 --> 14:50.515
That's who you're with,
Black Bloc.

14:50.648 --> 14:53.152
- Is it?
- No.

14:53.285 --> 14:55.454
Of course not, Conrad.

14:55.587 --> 14:58.757
Black Bloc has been declared
a terrorist organization.

14:58.890 --> 15:01.626
Its existence in Australia
would be illegal.

15:02.927 --> 15:08.167
Does your girlfriend
share your beliefs?

15:08.300 --> 15:11.703
Not really,
she's into animal rights.

15:11.836 --> 15:13.872
Shallow end policies.

15:14.005 --> 15:15.874
She'll be kept in the dark then?

15:16.007 --> 15:19.978
I can't even see clearly myself.

15:20.111 --> 15:23.014
To truly influence
public opinion,

15:23.149 --> 15:25.451
you need to commit an outrage.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.719
What sort of an outrage?

15:27.852 --> 15:30.622
Well now, you tell me.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.326
An explosion.

15:36.429 --> 15:37.929
No causalities.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.965
What you might call
"a victimless atrocity."

15:46.472 --> 15:47.239
Pass.

15:48.673 --> 15:49.908
- Let me out.
- We know

15:50.041 --> 15:52.944
you're a police informant,
Conrad.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.914
We don't mind,
it shows initiative.

15:56.047 --> 15:58.350
What we would mind, though,

15:58.484 --> 15:59.918
would be your case officer

16:00.051 --> 16:02.221
getting wind
of this little chat.

16:05.391 --> 16:09.027
I was never here.

16:09.161 --> 16:10.396
Let me out.

16:10.529 --> 16:12.764
Just before you head off.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.867
It's only takeaway.

16:27.179 --> 16:28.147
See ya.

16:39.391 --> 16:40.925
Did he take the bait?

16:41.059 --> 16:42.394
Yes.

16:42.528 --> 16:44.296
But he threw it back.

16:46.599 --> 16:47.500
What'd you say to him?

16:47.632 --> 16:48.867
Nothing.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.402
What you told me to say to him.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.704
In other words, you fucked it.

17:05.584 --> 17:07.319
Did you see Vladimir?

17:08.154 --> 17:10.422
Yeah, I did,
I'll tell you later.

17:10.556 --> 17:13.090
Hey, this one.

17:13.224 --> 17:14.791
Hey, he does not need
any extra help.

17:14.925 --> 17:16.661
Well, he...

17:20.064 --> 17:21.567
Thanks.

17:21.699 --> 17:23.301
Take over, I'll open the shop.

17:25.171 --> 17:27.373
- Get him, Stevie.
- Going down, Stevie!

17:27.506 --> 17:29.575
That's what you think.

17:29.707 --> 17:30.775
Bring it on.

17:57.670 --> 18:00.738
You know they'll kill you.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.174
Who's they?

18:02.308 --> 18:05.244
Thought about giving them up?

18:05.377 --> 18:06.945
I have.

18:07.078 --> 18:08.880
I need them too much.

18:09.013 --> 18:10.583
That's what I used to think.

18:10.715 --> 18:14.420
You know, after a while,
you don't even miss 'em.

18:43.215 --> 18:44.350
You don't have any hearts?

18:44.483 --> 18:46.751
- Nope.
- You sure?

18:46.884 --> 18:48.153
Yep.

18:52.790 --> 18:54.025
What's that?

18:54.159 --> 18:55.927
- A jack.
- A jack of what?

18:56.060 --> 18:57.329
- Hearts.
- Hearts, yeah.

18:57.463 --> 19:00.266
You can't renege, Stevie,
it's cheating.

19:02.066 --> 19:03.469
She's back.

19:06.070 --> 19:07.905
She's a sick bitch.

19:08.039 --> 19:09.774
That's right, Stevie.

19:09.907 --> 19:12.844
A sick bitch that Conrad
can't seem to get enough of.

19:21.953 --> 19:23.855
Stevie. Hey!

19:23.988 --> 19:25.457
Stevie, it's okay.

19:25.591 --> 19:28.059
Hey, Stevie, stop it, hey.

19:32.164 --> 19:34.832
Was it because I reneged?

19:34.966 --> 19:37.001
It has nothing to do with you.

19:37.136 --> 19:39.904
He's just... he's just worried,

19:40.038 --> 19:42.006
because the bookshop's
losing money.

19:58.122 --> 20:00.726
She knows,
you've told her about me.

20:00.858 --> 20:02.528
- I haven't!
- Oh, yeah?

20:02.661 --> 20:04.730
Then why does she act
like I just crawled out

20:04.862 --> 20:06.831
from under a rock?

20:08.099 --> 20:09.134
She doesn't like you

20:09.268 --> 20:11.370
because of what
you tried to order.

20:11.869 --> 20:13.871
What did I try to order?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.475
Erotic husbandry.

20:16.608 --> 20:18.777
Animal porn,
are you fucking kidding me?

20:18.910 --> 20:20.011
It seems appropriate.

20:20.145 --> 20:21.547
Oink, oink, oink, oink.

20:22.046 --> 20:23.047
It works, doesn't it?

20:23.182 --> 20:24.249
She keeps her distance.

20:24.383 --> 20:25.584
Calm.

20:29.254 --> 20:32.324
All right,
so what have you got for me?

20:32.458 --> 20:33.325
Nothing.

20:34.526 --> 20:35.761
Nothing?

20:35.893 --> 20:36.795
You sure about that?

20:36.928 --> 20:38.397
Nothing.

20:41.133 --> 20:44.236
You seen any of
your anarchist mates lately?

20:44.370 --> 20:46.037
We're not anarchists,
we're minarchists.

20:46.171 --> 20:47.105
You tell me.

20:47.239 --> 20:48.973
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

20:49.107 --> 20:51.377
I've got bigger fish to fry.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.779
How's Mr. Gunpowder,
Treason, and Plot?

20:53.945 --> 20:55.947
- Hippie Karl?
- Mm.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.250
Dishonorably discharged.

20:58.384 --> 21:00.853
- Father Michaelis?
- He's doing more of God's work,

21:00.985 --> 21:04.055
supergluing one ATM at a time.

21:04.189 --> 21:06.358
Alexander Ossipon?

21:06.492 --> 21:08.694
As far as I know,
he's keeping his cock clean,

21:08.827 --> 21:09.927
but why don't you ask them?

21:10.061 --> 21:12.631
They'll be over any minute.

21:12.765 --> 21:14.031
What, for a meeting?

21:14.166 --> 21:15.567
No, for poker.

21:15.701 --> 21:17.636
You do realize I have
a departmental budget

21:17.770 --> 21:19.405
to justify, don't you?

21:23.308 --> 21:25.042
- It's empty.
- Mm!

21:25.177 --> 21:27.212
Nothing earns you nothing.

21:27.346 --> 21:29.113
- No work, no pay.
- No, no, Kylie,

21:29.248 --> 21:30.114
you can't do this.

21:30.249 --> 21:31.383
We're behind on rent.

21:31.517 --> 21:32.584
Oh, really?

21:32.718 --> 21:33.752
Well, why don't you
try selling a few more

21:33.886 --> 21:35.354
of those
anarchist cookbooks?

21:36.688 --> 21:37.456
Fuck.

21:45.497 --> 21:46.698
Is she gone?

21:46.832 --> 21:48.667
Yeah.

21:51.870 --> 21:54.606
I haven't reneged, Conrad.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.141
That's good to hear.

22:39.785 --> 22:42.187
Just stuck up the ATM
on the corner.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.658
You're dripping.

22:58.837 --> 23:01.907
My flock's just not the same
without you, Winnie.

23:02.039 --> 23:03.442
And Stevie.

23:03.575 --> 23:05.444
It's not your flock,
it's your pack.

23:21.727 --> 23:22.728
Karl?

23:25.230 --> 23:27.232
Conrad said to go through.

23:31.068 --> 23:33.805
May he find his path of bliss.

23:36.174 --> 23:37.876
Round here?

23:38.010 --> 23:39.511
Pigs more likely.

24:07.673 --> 24:09.741
Emma Bovary is
beautiful and bored,

24:09.875 --> 24:12.210
trapped in a marriage
to a mediocre...

24:13.412 --> 24:14.580
Well, you know what they say,

24:14.713 --> 24:17.549
behind every boring man
is a bored woman.

24:17.683 --> 24:19.217
Who says that?

24:23.087 --> 24:24.523
Is that leather?

24:24.656 --> 24:26.058
Vegan leather.

24:26.191 --> 24:27.459
Vinyl?

24:27.593 --> 24:28.660
Vinyl.

24:30.662 --> 24:32.397
Put it out.

24:33.832 --> 24:35.300
Ashtray?

24:38.470 --> 24:40.038
Enjoyable read then, is it?

24:40.172 --> 24:41.406
I've read it before.

24:41.540 --> 24:42.908
Must be good
if you're reading it again.

24:43.041 --> 24:44.309
For the third time.

24:44.443 --> 24:46.411
See, I can't do that.

24:47.346 --> 24:49.081
If I know what's gonna happen,
there's no surprise,

24:49.214 --> 24:50.415
no excitement.

24:50.549 --> 24:53.185
Surprise and excitement
aren't everything.

24:53.318 --> 24:54.853
Aren't they?

25:00.759 --> 25:02.828
Your whoop's out the back.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.262
My whoop?

25:04.396 --> 25:05.864
Whoop of gorillas?

25:05.998 --> 25:08.333
My brother's collecting
collective nouns.

25:09.835 --> 25:11.203
Right then.

25:11.336 --> 25:13.138
Well, I'll go and join my whoop

25:13.271 --> 25:15.574
and leave you
to Monsieur Flaubert.

25:16.842 --> 25:18.577
Your car's parked
in a no standing zone.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.312
Not my car.

25:44.269 --> 25:46.004
Winnie?

25:46.139 --> 25:47.205
Yes?

25:47.339 --> 25:49.675
Are you minding the shop?

25:49.808 --> 25:51.576
Obviously not
at this particular moment,

25:51.710 --> 25:52.911
but yes.

25:53.712 --> 25:55.814
You're not smoking
in there, huh?

25:55.947 --> 25:57.849
Of course not.

25:57.983 --> 26:00.218
That'd make me a pawn
of Big Tobacco.

26:00.352 --> 26:02.587
Yeah, that and you promised
to give up.

26:18.970 --> 26:21.373
I think
the smoke alarm's broken.

26:26.111 --> 26:31.483
Four of the dominant males
have gathered to express

26:31.616 --> 26:35.353
a different point of view.

26:35.487 --> 26:38.390
They may appear social,

26:38.523 --> 26:40.826
but there's often
underlying tensions

26:40.959 --> 26:42.828
within the group.

26:42.961 --> 26:47.200
And here they are
in serious play.

26:47.332 --> 26:49.634
He was in police custody
and he drowned.

26:49.768 --> 26:51.570
- What does that tell you?
- Nothing.

26:51.703 --> 26:53.472
Why would he even bother
to come back as a ghost

26:53.605 --> 26:55.774
if he wasn't murdered?

26:55.907 --> 26:57.776
He's looking for revenge
on the three troopers

26:57.909 --> 27:01.680
- that drowned him.
- You always do this.

27:01.813 --> 27:05.450
You always turn a serious
sociopolitical discussion

27:05.584 --> 27:07.486
into a load of occult
bullshit.

27:07.619 --> 27:08.787
"Sociopolitical"?
You're arguing about a song,

27:08.920 --> 27:10.789
Waltzing Matilda,
for Christ's sake.

27:10.922 --> 27:13.625
"And he that blasphemeth
the name of the Lord

27:13.759 --> 27:15.060
shall surely be put to death,

27:15.194 --> 27:18.597
and all in the congregation
shall surely stone him."

27:18.730 --> 27:20.233
You're under my roof, Michaelis.

27:20.365 --> 27:21.767
Calm down.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.635
It's only blasphemy
if you're fool enough to believe

27:23.769 --> 27:26.004
that Jesus was
God's bastard son

27:28.006 --> 27:30.575
and not just a felater
of apostles.

27:37.883 --> 27:39.417
Come on.

27:41.019 --> 27:42.188
What is he doing?

27:42.320 --> 27:43.321
He's spying on us!

27:43.455 --> 27:44.322
He's not spying on us.

27:44.456 --> 27:45.957
Jesus Christ.

27:46.091 --> 27:48.261
You're gonna play cards
or I'm gonna kick you out.

27:48.393 --> 27:50.662
- Cards.
- What's your problem?

27:52.531 --> 27:53.698
Stevie, come on,
what are you doing?

27:53.832 --> 27:56.902
Get inside, get in group.

28:00.705 --> 28:02.307
Little like inviting
him to die.

28:02.440 --> 28:04.143
- What is?
- Stevie's condition.

28:04.277 --> 28:06.077
Okay, that's
your expert opinion, is it?

28:06.212 --> 28:07.180
Yeah, but you're not an expert.

28:10.615 --> 28:13.186
For anyone else to understand

28:13.318 --> 28:16.388
that a certificate on the wall
doesn't prove you're a doctor.

28:16.521 --> 28:19.958
It proves you're a drug dealer
for the multinationals.

28:20.126 --> 28:21.593
Like everything else
in this society,

28:21.726 --> 28:24.496
it's cannibalistic.

28:24.629 --> 28:28.667
Nourishing their greed
on the quivering flesh

28:28.800 --> 28:31.403
and warm blood of the people.

28:38.211 --> 28:39.678
Wankers.

29:08.039 --> 29:09.474
Stevie, go to bed.

29:12.311 --> 29:14.412
Stevie?

29:14.546 --> 29:16.648
Steven! Hey!

29:50.081 --> 29:51.284
Stevie?

29:51.416 --> 29:54.019
Stevie, stop it.

29:54.153 --> 29:55.620
Stevie!

29:56.521 --> 29:58.423
Stevie!

29:58.556 --> 30:00.359
Stevie, freeze!

30:00.492 --> 30:01.960
Stevie.

30:06.665 --> 30:08.600
And unfreeze.

30:09.567 --> 30:10.635
Look, you're just upset, okay?

30:10.769 --> 30:12.437
You need to calm down.

30:14.906 --> 30:16.875
You wanna watch something?

30:17.509 --> 30:19.744
How about
some David Attenborough?

30:28.321 --> 30:30.222
What was that all about?

30:31.122 --> 30:34.459
Something Hippie Karl said
about cannibalism.

30:34.592 --> 30:35.694
You know how Stevie is,

30:35.827 --> 30:36.895
he gets these images
stuck in his mind

30:37.028 --> 30:39.131
and he can't get rid of them.

30:39.265 --> 30:40.598
Well, he shouldn't
have been listening

30:40.732 --> 30:43.235
and just snooping around
with his camera phone.

30:43.369 --> 30:44.869
It's his new hobby.

30:45.003 --> 30:46.439
He needs something
to keep him occupied.

30:46.571 --> 30:47.539
Spying's not a hobby.

30:47.672 --> 30:49.408
He's not spying.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.978
He's documenting
the human species.

30:55.247 --> 30:56.748
Let him have his fun.

30:58.783 --> 31:00.852
Father Michaelis
wasn't happy about it.

31:00.986 --> 31:02.954
Father Michaelis
can go fuck himself.

31:06.891 --> 31:09.060
Hey, tell me about Vladimir.

31:11.529 --> 31:13.598
I'm not allowed to.

31:13.732 --> 31:15.767
Well, that's stupid.

31:15.900 --> 31:18.536
Of course you can tell me,
I'm your partner.

31:18.670 --> 31:21.106
Does he wanna fund us?

31:21.240 --> 31:23.641
He does.

31:23.775 --> 31:27.846
Thought your fax revival
was genius.

31:27.979 --> 31:29.382
So?

31:31.317 --> 31:32.851
He's Black Bloc.

31:35.254 --> 31:36.688
Black Bloc.

31:37.822 --> 31:39.225
What as in
the banned organization?

31:39.358 --> 31:40.992
Very same.

31:44.996 --> 31:47.532
Did they offer you money?

31:47.665 --> 31:50.869
He did.

31:51.002 --> 31:53.538
- I think so.
- You think so?

31:53.671 --> 31:54.873
Well, he gave me
this brown paper bag,

31:55.006 --> 31:56.708
but I threw it in the bin.

31:59.077 --> 32:02.047
Well, Black Bloc advocates
for armed resistance.

32:02.181 --> 32:04.115
We can't be associated
with them.

32:05.717 --> 32:06.818
Actually,
that was the only thing

32:06.951 --> 32:09.288
he was specific about,
nonviolence.

32:10.489 --> 32:12.090
Really?

32:13.192 --> 32:15.860
- Nonviolence?
- Categorical.

32:21.633 --> 32:23.169
Where's the bin located?

33:53.791 --> 33:55.427
- Did you peak?
- No.

33:55.561 --> 33:56.928
- You didn't?
- No.

34:12.043 --> 34:14.012
That's a lot, isn't it?

34:15.581 --> 34:18.016
That's not not a lot.

34:24.223 --> 34:26.925
Does that light your fire?

34:29.360 --> 34:30.396
Yeah.

34:30.529 --> 34:31.829
Yeah?

34:31.963 --> 34:34.333
Does it light yours?

34:40.672 --> 34:42.341
Yeah.

35:19.578 --> 35:21.779
That one is $46.

35:21.913 --> 35:25.083
Minus 10% is $42.40.

35:25.217 --> 35:26.951
Thanks.

35:32.757 --> 35:33.592
Here's your change.

35:33.726 --> 35:35.527
Have a nice day.

35:43.736 --> 35:45.704
I was gonna shoplift this,
but then I noticed

35:45.837 --> 35:47.473
the security cameras.

35:47.606 --> 35:49.308
Those?

35:49.441 --> 35:50.041
They don't work.

35:50.175 --> 35:51.843
Conrad unplugged them.

35:51.976 --> 35:53.646
Is this worth stealing?

35:53.778 --> 35:55.079
Yes.

35:55.214 --> 35:57.650
But now you have to pay for it.

35:57.782 --> 35:59.117
You've watched it?

35:59.251 --> 35:59.984
No.

36:00.118 --> 36:01.953
Twenty dollars, please.

36:02.086 --> 36:04.889
- Gave him a discount.
- Well, he bought a book.

36:05.023 --> 36:05.890
Do you want to buy a book?

36:06.024 --> 36:07.726
I don't even want to buy this.

36:07.859 --> 36:09.794
So what do you want?

36:13.699 --> 36:15.534
To see Conrad.

36:16.235 --> 36:18.570
He's in Sydney for the week.

36:18.704 --> 36:20.639
I forgot. Of course.

36:20.773 --> 36:23.975
He's gone off to preach
the fax machine revolution.

36:24.108 --> 36:26.178
What's wrong with that?

36:26.312 --> 36:29.047
Well, the vinyl record revival,
that made sense,

36:29.181 --> 36:31.417
but fax machines?

36:31.550 --> 36:32.984
Seems frivolous.

36:33.117 --> 36:34.986
You're frivolous.

36:35.119 --> 36:36.422
It's analog communication.

36:36.555 --> 36:38.089
It leaves no data trail.

36:38.223 --> 36:40.124
Yeah, I get that, obviously.

36:41.794 --> 36:44.163
Just don't see it taking off.

36:44.296 --> 36:46.665
Nobody cares
about privacy anymore.

36:46.799 --> 36:48.866
They want to be observed.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.204
If not by God,
then at least by technology.

36:52.338 --> 36:55.374
I seem to exist,
therefore I exist.

36:55.507 --> 36:56.742
Exactly.

36:56.874 --> 36:59.578
See this?

36:59.712 --> 37:01.613
You and me?

37:01.747 --> 37:03.081
We have.

37:07.286 --> 37:09.688
Do you like the beach?

37:09.822 --> 37:11.055
In summer.

37:11.190 --> 37:12.758
It's midwinter.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.626
Yeah, but global warming.

37:16.060 --> 37:17.995
Let's go and swim.

37:18.130 --> 37:20.232
I have a bookshop to run.

37:20.366 --> 37:21.734
Yeah, it's afternoons
and evenings.

37:21.866 --> 37:23.000
That gives you
the whole morning.

37:23.135 --> 37:24.737
Yeah, to spend time
with my brother.

37:24.869 --> 37:25.970
Stevie?

37:26.104 --> 37:27.139
Bring him along.

37:27.272 --> 37:29.575
It'll be fun.

37:31.677 --> 37:33.679
I'll think about it.

37:33.812 --> 37:36.981
Thinking about it
is the worst thing you can do.

37:37.115 --> 37:39.884
Just say yes.

37:41.687 --> 37:43.489
Maybe.

37:46.258 --> 37:49.060
Hey, you can't take that.

37:54.932 --> 37:56.668
Do you smoke?

37:56.802 --> 37:58.404
Officially?

37:58.537 --> 37:59.772
Definitely not.

37:59.904 --> 38:02.039
Stevie?

38:02.174 --> 38:04.209
Not a word to Conrad,
you promise?

38:04.343 --> 38:06.345
Promise.

38:06.478 --> 38:09.515
So how did you and Conrad meet?

38:11.383 --> 38:14.586
We met
at an animal rights rally.

38:17.256 --> 38:20.192
His band was playing there.

38:20.325 --> 38:22.361
I liked the way
he held his guitar,

38:22.494 --> 38:24.863
and Stevie even liked the noise
coming out of it.

38:24.996 --> 38:26.131
Didn't you, Stevie?

38:26.265 --> 38:29.835
Conrad gave us
backstage passes.

38:29.967 --> 38:32.036
Oh, so you're a groupie?

38:32.171 --> 38:33.872
Fuck off.

38:35.707 --> 38:37.543
Does he still play guitar?

38:38.976 --> 38:40.679
Not with the band.

38:40.813 --> 38:43.649
No, he's too busy
trying to make ends meet.

38:43.782 --> 38:45.918
I hear that.

38:46.050 --> 38:47.586
Convictions.

38:47.719 --> 38:50.856
Musical, artistic,
political, whatever.

38:50.988 --> 38:52.925
None of them pay the bills.

38:53.057 --> 38:55.794
They all need something
on the side.

38:55.928 --> 38:58.764
What's your something
on the side then?

38:58.897 --> 39:00.299
Me?

39:01.834 --> 39:03.235
Stevie?

39:03.368 --> 39:06.138
Your sister tells me
you like collective nouns.

39:06.271 --> 39:10.409
What's a good one for generous,
well-heeled friends?

39:12.009 --> 39:13.077
Don't say a murder.

39:13.212 --> 39:16.348
A murder of crows.

39:16.482 --> 39:19.116
- No.
- A wake of vultures,

39:19.251 --> 39:22.221
an unkindness of ravens.

39:22.354 --> 39:25.491
dole of doves,
a bevy of quails.

39:25.624 --> 39:26.758
Bevy.

39:26.892 --> 39:29.661
A bevy of generous,
well-heeled friends.

39:29.795 --> 39:33.131
Mm, well-heeled in high heels,
I'm sure.

39:33.265 --> 39:35.066
A convocation of eagles,

39:35.200 --> 39:38.102
a parliament of rooks.

39:38.237 --> 39:39.471
Stevie, that's enough.

40:24.216 --> 40:27.084
What the fuck is that?

40:27.219 --> 40:31.088
Fish choke on cigarettes.

40:45.571 --> 40:47.973
- Got a match, Stevie?
- No.

40:48.105 --> 40:49.441
You're supposed to say:

40:49.575 --> 40:51.108
"Your face, my ass,
that's a match,"

40:51.243 --> 40:53.712
or, "Not since Superman died."

40:53.845 --> 40:56.381
Superman is immortal.

40:56.515 --> 40:58.383
Your face, my ass.

40:59.985 --> 41:00.786
Alex, don't you dare!

41:00.919 --> 41:02.521
Winnie!

41:02.654 --> 41:05.457
It's all right, Stevie,
he won't let me go.

41:08.360 --> 41:09.861
Look at that.

41:11.630 --> 41:13.699
Booyah!

41:13.832 --> 41:16.602
Nice one, Stevie.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.804
"Marine sanctuary.

41:18.937 --> 41:22.140
No fishing, no harpoons."

41:24.009 --> 41:26.278
Which one is your favorite?

41:26.411 --> 41:29.147
I like the blue ones.

41:29.281 --> 41:32.184
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

41:32.317 --> 41:34.419
You're gonna scare the fish.

41:34.553 --> 41:35.721
Sorry.

41:35.854 --> 41:37.389
Think he's fine.

41:39.257 --> 41:40.726
Hey, mister!

41:40.859 --> 41:43.028
That's against the law!

41:43.161 --> 41:44.730
You criminal!

41:44.863 --> 41:46.531
What is that?

41:50.268 --> 41:52.104
Stevie!

41:52.237 --> 41:53.839
Stevie! Freeze!

41:57.776 --> 41:59.778
Let go of him!

42:01.713 --> 42:03.615
- Winnie!
- Stop!

42:03.749 --> 42:05.183
Let go! Stop it!

42:05.317 --> 42:07.219
Let go of me! Stevie!

42:07.352 --> 42:09.321
Stevie, are you okay?

42:30.742 --> 42:32.811
What are you doing
behind the counter, Stevie?

42:34.279 --> 42:36.214
Winnie is cooking.

42:36.348 --> 42:38.884
I have to ring the bell
if anyone comes in.

42:39.017 --> 42:42.220
Wait, you don't have to do it
if it's me.

42:42.354 --> 42:43.922
How are ya?

42:46.825 --> 42:49.428
The fax machine
ran out of paper.

42:50.996 --> 42:51.830
Well, it shouldn't have.

42:51.963 --> 42:55.033
I only filled it up
before I left.

42:55.168 --> 42:56.768
How many messages were there?

42:56.902 --> 42:58.937
Just one.

43:04.109 --> 43:06.912
Where's my takeaway order?
Where's my takeaway order?

43:07.045 --> 43:09.381
Where's my takeaway order?
Where's my takeaway order?

43:09.514 --> 43:11.483
That's enough, Stevie,
it's a loop.

43:11.616 --> 43:15.887
Some very hungry person
has dialed the wrong number.

43:17.456 --> 43:19.091
Wasted all our fax paper.

43:19.224 --> 43:21.359
Should I burn it?

43:21.493 --> 43:22.594
Uh, no, later.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.696
Here, I got you a present.

43:24.830 --> 43:26.998
Don't look, close your eyes.

43:28.467 --> 43:29.468
Close 'em.

43:33.872 --> 43:34.940
Open 'em.

43:35.073 --> 43:37.409
Ta-da!

43:37.542 --> 43:39.010
A wolf onesie?

43:39.145 --> 43:41.880
Well, more of
an all-in-one track suit,

43:42.013 --> 43:43.915
but there you go.

43:48.053 --> 43:50.956
What's the matter?
Don't you like it?

43:51.089 --> 43:52.791
It's fantastic.

43:52.924 --> 43:55.393
The gray wolf
is my favorite animal.

43:57.596 --> 44:01.099
Winnie says I'm not allowed
any more treats.

44:01.234 --> 44:03.835
Stevie, freeze.

44:04.669 --> 44:07.839
Why aren't you allowed
any more treats?

44:10.675 --> 44:14.279
Because of what I did
at the beach.

44:15.647 --> 44:18.517
When did you go to the beach?

44:20.452 --> 44:22.521
On Wednesday.

44:22.654 --> 44:24.790
We went in Alex's car.

44:24.923 --> 44:26.458
Alex Ossipon?

44:28.059 --> 44:31.930
He's a nice enough human,
I suppose.

44:36.701 --> 44:41.072
Except he kept putting
his paws on Winnie.

44:47.213 --> 44:49.414
Here, this is yours.

44:50.849 --> 44:53.718
Don't let anyone
take it from ya.

44:56.454 --> 44:59.090
You tell me what happened.

45:03.296 --> 45:07.300
- I'm back.
- Did Stevie show you that fax?

45:07.432 --> 45:10.669
Yeah, Black Bloc,
fucking psychos.

45:10.802 --> 45:12.671
We need to give them
a strategy.

45:12.804 --> 45:15.373
Did you speak to anyone
in Sydney?

45:17.243 --> 45:20.478
Not really. I reckon we should
give that money back, though.

45:20.612 --> 45:22.547
Fuck that.

45:22.681 --> 45:23.982
That's a non-refundable
donation.

45:24.115 --> 45:25.750
We need it.

45:25.884 --> 45:26.985
Besides, I want to use
some of it

45:27.118 --> 45:29.421
for a mobile cop protest.

45:31.257 --> 45:33.959
How was your week?

45:34.092 --> 45:35.727
Pretty quiet.

45:35.861 --> 45:38.264
That's not what Stevie says.

45:38.396 --> 45:41.066
He told you about it?

45:41.200 --> 45:43.468
It wasn't good,
but at least he did something.

45:43.602 --> 45:45.238
Everybody else
just stood there gawking.

45:45.370 --> 45:48.874
Yeah, especially that old
cunt-tease Ossipon, I bet.

45:49.774 --> 45:51.409
Alexander is hardly old.

45:51.543 --> 45:53.279
Well, the cunts he teases are.

45:53.411 --> 45:54.980
How did that come about,

45:55.113 --> 45:58.450
Ossipon just driving you
to the beach?

45:59.218 --> 46:01.320
Us to the beach.

46:01.453 --> 46:02.654
He came in here looking for you

46:02.787 --> 46:04.923
and he just offered,
spur of the moment.

46:05.056 --> 46:06.491
He knew I was in Sydney.

46:07.260 --> 46:09.328
Well, he said he forgot.

46:09.461 --> 46:12.063
Pfft, sure he did.

46:12.198 --> 46:13.465
What?

46:13.598 --> 46:15.901
It's got a bad smell to it.

46:16.034 --> 46:17.869
I don't know.

46:18.003 --> 46:21.406
It smells like opportunity
to me.

46:21.539 --> 46:24.843
You do understand
this is just a deposit?

46:29.014 --> 46:30.283
Let me out.

46:30.448 --> 46:31.850
Oh, Conrad.

46:31.983 --> 46:34.886
Conrad, come here, come here.

46:35.020 --> 46:36.621
Come here.

46:38.190 --> 46:39.292
You see this?

46:42.027 --> 46:44.496
This is your itemized
police income

46:44.629 --> 46:47.199
for the last 18 months.

46:49.534 --> 46:50.735
As I said to you last time,

46:50.869 --> 46:53.038
we don't care
that you're a police informant.

46:54.806 --> 46:57.042
But the people
you're informing on

46:57.176 --> 46:59.444
might see it
a little differently.

47:00.812 --> 47:05.083
And one fax transmission
is all it's gonna take.

47:06.385 --> 47:09.155
They're going to kill me,
you know that?

47:09.288 --> 47:12.991
And as inept as they are,
they might very well succeed.

47:13.124 --> 47:16.162
But you do
this one action for us...

47:19.831 --> 47:22.467
...and you're immune
to suspicion.

47:23.302 --> 47:25.904
You'd be the little anarchist
that could.

47:27.440 --> 47:28.740
Minarchist.

47:34.479 --> 47:35.547
Be right there.

47:55.533 --> 47:57.203
Stephanie.

48:01.706 --> 48:04.042
Wow, that's a lot of mirror.

48:05.777 --> 48:08.180
It's supposed to make the place
look bigger.

48:08.314 --> 48:10.383
Nothing to do
with narcissism then?

48:10.548 --> 48:12.418
Are you grooming my girlfriend?

48:12.550 --> 48:14.719
- Grooming?
- Mm-hm.

48:14.853 --> 48:16.621
Sapiosexual grooming.

48:16.755 --> 48:19.325
That's your modus operandi,
isn't it?

48:19.458 --> 48:20.393
That's ridiculous.

48:20.525 --> 48:21.526
Where is this coming from?

48:21.659 --> 48:23.329
Not Winnie.

48:25.663 --> 48:27.932
It's Winifred to you.

48:29.634 --> 48:30.668
Ow!

48:30.802 --> 48:33.038
Oh, f... ow!

48:33.172 --> 48:34.373
Jesus, what did you
do that for?

48:34.507 --> 48:35.573
That fucking hurt!

48:35.707 --> 48:36.342
I thought you were
gonna assault me.

48:36.475 --> 48:37.809
What?

48:37.942 --> 48:41.046
Put the fucking dildo down
and answer the question.

48:41.180 --> 48:42.647
I drove her and her brother
to the beach.

48:42.781 --> 48:44.015
End of story.

48:44.949 --> 48:47.353
The beach. Did you feel her up?

48:47.486 --> 48:48.820
What are you, 14?

48:49.654 --> 48:50.989
Did you touch her?

48:52.824 --> 48:55.227
My hand might have
brushed her knee.

48:55.361 --> 48:57.229
Is that touching?

49:05.003 --> 49:06.704
I have to talk to you
about something else.

49:06.838 --> 49:10.108
- What?
- Just put... put the dildo down.

49:13.479 --> 49:14.313
What?

49:18.250 --> 49:20.386
Where would you stage
a victimless atrocity

49:20.519 --> 49:22.587
to protest the G20 Summit?

49:22.720 --> 49:24.290
A what?

49:25.723 --> 49:27.659
A victimless atrocity.

49:27.792 --> 49:29.161
That's an oxymoron.

49:29.295 --> 49:30.762
Just...

49:32.231 --> 49:33.365
It would have to be
somewhere prominent

49:33.499 --> 49:35.100
to get media attention.

49:37.336 --> 49:39.804
Somewhere safe for the public,
I guess.

49:41.373 --> 49:42.807
Where is that?

49:43.675 --> 49:44.976
No idea.

49:46.010 --> 49:47.779
Why are you asking?

49:49.381 --> 49:51.183
- Fucking gigolo.
- Ow!

49:51.317 --> 49:55.053
Stay away from my girlfriend,
you hear me?

49:55.187 --> 49:57.189
Piece of sh...

50:19.178 --> 50:20.979
What are you doing awake?

50:21.112 --> 50:23.915
You woke me
when you left the house.

50:24.048 --> 50:25.683
- 4:00 a.m.
- Yeah, well,

50:25.817 --> 50:28.554
I had someone to see.

50:28.686 --> 50:30.556
Alex Ossipon?

50:30.688 --> 50:32.957
Did you beat him up?

50:33.091 --> 50:35.093
No, I didn't beat him up.

50:35.227 --> 50:36.629
Gave him a slap.

50:36.761 --> 50:38.763
- You didn't.
- Yeah.

50:38.897 --> 50:40.432
What for? He didn't do anything.

50:40.566 --> 50:41.799
He did something.

50:41.933 --> 50:44.136
Oh, he put his hand on my knee.

50:44.936 --> 50:48.039
Good, that's why
he only got a slap.

50:51.075 --> 50:52.844
Did he mention anything
about Stevie's behavior

50:52.977 --> 50:53.945
at the beach?

50:54.078 --> 50:55.880
No, we had other topics
to discuss.

50:56.014 --> 50:57.650
I'm worried he's regressing.

50:57.815 --> 50:59.117
He... he's not regressing.

50:59.251 --> 51:01.686
Besides, the way you tell it,

51:01.819 --> 51:03.087
he acted like a hero.

51:03.222 --> 51:06.158
He spends too much time
in the shop.

51:09.628 --> 51:12.164
Why don't you take him with you

51:12.298 --> 51:14.400
on your errands?

51:14.533 --> 51:16.968
Winnie, it's inappropriate
for Stevie to be involved.

51:17.101 --> 51:18.970
He doesn't have to be
involved-involved.

51:19.103 --> 51:22.308
He can just, you know,
help with fax distribution

51:22.441 --> 51:24.042
or handing out leaflets.

51:24.176 --> 51:26.412
Anything delicate, you can
just send him out of earshot.

51:26.545 --> 51:27.946
It's likely to go
over his head anyway.

51:28.079 --> 51:30.349
Sounds like a recipe
for disaster.

51:31.650 --> 51:32.651
So you do think
he's getting worse.

51:32.784 --> 51:33.952
No.

51:34.085 --> 51:36.222
I think he's fine. I'm just...

51:37.922 --> 51:40.758
I have a lot of my mind,
so can you just let me...

51:40.892 --> 51:42.860
just let me think about it,
all right?

51:43.895 --> 51:46.064
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

51:51.403 --> 51:54.038
Hey, I like
that you got jealous.

51:55.740 --> 51:58.109
- Yeah?
- Mm.

51:59.978 --> 52:03.014
Makes me want to light
your fire.

52:25.770 --> 52:27.105
Ugh.

52:29.007 --> 52:30.975
You are not wearing
that onesie.

52:31.109 --> 52:32.478
It's not a onesie.

52:32.611 --> 52:35.748
It's an all-in-one
track suit.

52:35.880 --> 52:37.015
Do you want some breakfast?

52:37.149 --> 52:38.916
No, we'll get something out.

52:39.050 --> 52:41.287
Well, nothing with trans fat
or MSG, okay?

52:41.420 --> 52:42.454
Roger that.

52:43.622 --> 52:45.524
Be good.

52:45.658 --> 52:46.891
Okay.

52:47.792 --> 52:49.561
You too.

52:56.235 --> 53:01.005
Although, they are known
to be social animals,

53:01.140 --> 53:05.843
they do not look or communicate
with each other.

53:07.111 --> 53:10.182
Some of them have noticed us.

53:11.784 --> 53:15.354
They change their behavior.

53:15.487 --> 53:20.124
Their facial features
become hostile.

53:20.259 --> 53:24.363
They do not like
being stared at.

53:28.200 --> 53:31.969
See the white plugs
in this male's ears?

53:32.103 --> 53:34.139
This is how they will listen

53:34.273 --> 53:37.376
to their private songs.

53:37.509 --> 53:39.977
The songs are mostly about
how good it feels

53:40.111 --> 53:41.979
to be with another human.

53:42.113 --> 53:43.349
Do you mind?

53:44.949 --> 53:47.919
But even when you stop staring,

53:48.052 --> 53:51.390
they are still being stared at.

53:51.523 --> 53:54.992
Do they know they are
always being watched?

53:55.127 --> 53:57.129
Stevie, come and sit down.

54:02.234 --> 54:04.703
Turn that off, put it away.

54:04.837 --> 54:07.706
Can I film out of the window?

54:08.307 --> 54:10.875
Yeah, without the commentary.

54:15.113 --> 54:16.548
Could we have

54:16.682 --> 54:19.951
a non-trans fat, non-MSG lunch?

54:26.759 --> 54:27.860
Conrad...

54:27.992 --> 54:30.396
MCG.

54:41.973 --> 54:44.075
The MCG.

54:44.209 --> 54:45.511
No. No, no.

54:45.644 --> 54:48.012
That's, um, that's too iconic.

54:48.147 --> 54:51.115
It's just some fireworks
in the forecourt.

54:51.250 --> 54:53.519
Little takeaway container
in the rubbish bin.

54:55.220 --> 54:57.823
All right. Who's supplying
the takeaway?

54:57.955 --> 54:58.857
Well, that's the problem.

54:58.990 --> 55:00.024
There's no one trustworthy.

55:00.159 --> 55:01.993
I even flew up to Sydney.

55:02.127 --> 55:03.695
Well, what about
closer to home?

55:03.829 --> 55:06.265
How about Karl Yunt?

55:08.300 --> 55:10.769
Hippie Karl?
No, he's a nasty burnout.

55:10.903 --> 55:14.005
Well, maybe, but he's got form
with fireworks

55:14.139 --> 55:16.241
and bins as it turns out.

55:17.443 --> 55:19.611
Recycling,
how's that gonna work?

55:20.779 --> 55:22.247
A timer set for 4:00 a.m.,

55:22.381 --> 55:24.450
just so it's the rubbish bin
being recycled.

55:24.583 --> 55:25.950
No spectators.

55:26.585 --> 55:28.220
What time
are the bins collected?

55:28.353 --> 55:29.688
6:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

55:29.822 --> 55:30.923
How much money do I get?

55:36.895 --> 55:39.331
Why did you say
you couldn't do it without him?

55:43.769 --> 55:46.138
Did you say something?

55:46.271 --> 55:48.005
You said you're amazed
how you ever managed

55:48.140 --> 55:49.808
without Stevie's help.

55:52.644 --> 55:55.681
I only said that
to make him feel good.

55:55.814 --> 55:58.983
- But he wasn't any bother?
- No, he wasn't any bother.

55:59.116 --> 56:01.954
So why can't he go with you
anymore?

56:02.086 --> 56:04.590
I've never seen Stevie so happy.

56:04.723 --> 56:06.458
What's going on?

56:06.592 --> 56:08.993
Nothing is going on,
I've just been thinking

56:09.761 --> 56:11.563
it's wrong to get him involved
with something

56:11.697 --> 56:13.966
that he really doesn't
understand.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.735
He understands a lot more
than you think.

56:16.869 --> 56:18.337
Well, that's even worse.

56:18.470 --> 56:20.172
I don't want to get him
in trouble.

56:25.477 --> 56:26.879
Why do you think
I let him come with us

56:27.011 --> 56:28.313
on the chicken raid?

56:30.349 --> 56:34.085
I knew that if we got caught,
he'd be safe.

56:39.056 --> 56:40.492
What are you saying?

56:41.560 --> 56:44.530
Diminished responsibility.

56:44.663 --> 56:47.332
No magistrate
would ever convict him.

56:48.901 --> 56:51.102
Let him be helpful.

56:52.905 --> 56:55.407
Do you really mean that?

56:55.541 --> 56:58.644
He'd walk through fire for you.

56:58.777 --> 57:00.679
We trust you.

57:15.727 --> 57:17.796
We might give
the fax machine distribution

57:17.930 --> 57:19.765
a miss today, Stevie.

57:21.433 --> 57:24.369
What are we going to do then?

57:27.005 --> 57:28.674
Well, believe it or not,
I've got two free tickets

57:28.807 --> 57:30.242
to the aquarium.

57:31.075 --> 57:34.078
- Can we see the sharks?
- Yeah, we can see the sharks.

57:37.215 --> 57:40.485
First of all, I got to drop in
and see Hippie Karl, okay?

57:40.619 --> 57:43.589
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
next stop Richmond.

57:43.722 --> 57:45.557
You hungry?

58:13.752 --> 58:17.322
Despite of
its fearsome appearance

58:17.456 --> 58:20.726
and rows of sharp teeth,

58:20.859 --> 58:22.894
the gray nurse shark

58:23.028 --> 58:25.697
poses no threat to humans

58:25.831 --> 58:31.103
and is, in fact,
a superbly adapted fish eater,

58:31.236 --> 58:36.308
usually swallowing
its prey whole.

58:36.441 --> 58:38.877
One of God's most magnificent
creatures.

58:39.011 --> 58:41.013
Father Michaelis?

58:41.146 --> 58:42.748
What are you doing here?

58:42.881 --> 58:44.449
I often come here.

58:44.583 --> 58:46.652
It's one of my favorite haunts.

58:46.785 --> 58:49.621
Do you know I caught
one of those once?

58:51.189 --> 58:53.258
What did you do to it?

58:53.392 --> 58:56.261
Don't worry. I let it go.

58:56.395 --> 58:58.463
I'm a catch-and-release
fisherman.

58:58.597 --> 59:00.866
What does that mean?

59:00.999 --> 59:04.836
It means it's all about
the struggle, the suspense,

59:04.970 --> 59:06.705
the mystery of what's
on the end of the line

59:06.838 --> 59:08.774
until it's right
out of the water,

59:08.907 --> 59:12.145
and then you know
and you set it free.

59:13.979 --> 59:16.415
Jesus was a fisherman.

59:16.548 --> 59:18.917
A fisher of fish
and a fisher of men.

59:20.318 --> 59:22.454
He was a carpenter.

59:23.622 --> 59:24.656
Do you think you'd like to be

59:24.790 --> 59:26.792
a catch-and-release fisherman,
Stevie?

59:28.393 --> 59:31.897
- Does it hurt the fish?
- No.

59:32.030 --> 59:33.432
Fish don't have feelings.

59:33.565 --> 59:35.333
I mean, they choke a bit
on the air

59:35.467 --> 59:38.303
till you take the hook out,

59:38.437 --> 59:40.439
but then you slip them
back into the water

59:40.572 --> 59:43.508
and they swim away,
good as gold.

59:45.343 --> 59:48.547
As a matter of fact,
on the long weekend

59:48.680 --> 59:51.616
I'm going to
my secret fishing spot.

59:51.750 --> 59:53.785
Would you like to come along?

59:53.919 --> 59:56.121
Yes.

59:56.254 --> 01:00:00.159
But I'll have to ask my sister
for permission.

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:03.428
Of course.

01:00:03.562 --> 01:00:05.430
You check with Winnie.

01:00:08.633 --> 01:00:10.302
Where did you get that from?

01:00:10.435 --> 01:00:13.172
Father Michaelis gave it to me.

01:00:13.305 --> 01:00:15.208
Father Michaelis?

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.877
He's invited me
on a fishing expedition.

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.912
Fishing? You hate fishing.

01:00:21.046 --> 01:00:22.347
It's catch and release.

01:00:22.481 --> 01:00:23.682
Throw 'em back.

01:00:24.583 --> 01:00:27.385
The fish don't get hurt.

01:00:27.519 --> 01:00:29.087
Where to?

01:00:29.222 --> 01:00:30.789
That's a secret.

01:00:30.922 --> 01:00:32.491
Well, if it's a secret,
I don't think you'll be going.

01:00:32.624 --> 01:00:34.193
- The Yarra.
- You told?

01:00:34.326 --> 01:00:36.828
Yeah, yeah, it's okay,
the Yarra is a big river.

01:00:37.462 --> 01:00:39.165
Long weekend.

01:00:39.297 --> 01:00:40.832
Just a bit of camping.

01:00:42.434 --> 01:00:44.203
Will you go with him?

01:00:44.903 --> 01:00:46.239
I can't because I'm going
up to Sydney,

01:00:46.371 --> 01:00:48.807
but he'll be fine
with Michaelis.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:49.875
He will.

01:00:50.008 --> 01:00:51.676
Please!

01:00:53.979 --> 01:00:55.413
Well, if you go in a boat,
you have to promise

01:00:55.547 --> 01:00:58.016
to wear your life preserver,
okay?

01:00:58.151 --> 01:00:59.785
Promise.

01:00:59.918 --> 01:01:01.353
And...

01:01:01.486 --> 01:01:03.822
You're not taking that onesie.

01:01:04.856 --> 01:01:07.425
Careful, I'm holding a knife.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.529
Here we are

01:01:10.662 --> 01:01:15.000
on the road
to a top-secret fishing spot.

01:01:15.134 --> 01:01:18.804
It's called "Spot X."

01:01:31.883 --> 01:01:33.152
See?

01:01:33.286 --> 01:01:35.520
Easy as.

01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:42.661
You want to pull both oars
at the same time.

01:01:42.794 --> 01:01:45.931
Yeah, that's it, mate,
you're getting it.

01:01:48.433 --> 01:01:49.868
What species?

01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:52.938
I think it's
an Oncorhynchus mykiss.

01:01:53.071 --> 01:01:54.339
A what?

01:01:54.472 --> 01:01:56.209
A rainbow trout, Stevie.

01:01:56.341 --> 01:01:57.909
Good size, too.

01:01:58.043 --> 01:01:59.110
Easy now.

01:01:59.245 --> 01:02:00.812
We have to let it go.

01:02:00.946 --> 01:02:03.849
Lift it into the boat
and we'll unhook it.

01:02:05.483 --> 01:02:07.953
Oh, Stevie, what a beauty.

01:02:08.086 --> 01:02:10.488
Straight on the grill,
squeeze of lemon.

01:02:10.622 --> 01:02:13.558
Melts in your mouth.

01:02:13.692 --> 01:02:16.361
You're a catch-and-release
fisherman.

01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:19.731
Yeah, native species.

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:22.534
This fella here,
he's an illegal immigrant.

01:02:24.035 --> 01:02:25.704
Illegal?

01:02:25.837 --> 01:02:28.106
How can he be illegal?

01:02:28.874 --> 01:02:31.843
One knock to the head,
he won't feel a thing.

01:02:33.979 --> 01:02:35.780
Come on, Stevie,
what's it gonna be?

01:02:35.914 --> 01:02:39.252
A cordon bleu dinner
or baked beans from a can?

01:02:45.291 --> 01:02:47.759
Baked beans out of a can.

01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:01.340
Conrad is here.

01:03:01.473 --> 01:03:04.243
How did he find Spot X?

01:03:04.377 --> 01:03:06.345
- I wonder.
- He's brought

01:03:06.478 --> 01:03:10.115
non-trans fat,
non-MSG takeaway.

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:12.617
We don't need to eat
baked beans.

01:03:12.751 --> 01:03:14.387
Turn your camera off, Stevie.

01:03:14.519 --> 01:03:16.588
Now.

01:03:16.721 --> 01:03:18.690
This is a domestic drama.

01:03:18.823 --> 01:03:21.160
There's nothing
incriminating here.

01:03:22.928 --> 01:03:24.363
And a lot of it
is not even relevant

01:03:24.496 --> 01:03:25.897
to the investigation.

01:03:29.302 --> 01:03:31.203
A play is in two acts.

01:03:31.337 --> 01:03:32.904
You've only seen the first.

01:03:39.844 --> 01:03:42.447
Madame Bovary, may I?

01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:43.882
You're very kind, but...

01:03:44.015 --> 01:03:46.185
Thank you, no,
I couldn't possibly.

01:03:46.319 --> 01:03:47.953
But I insist.

01:03:48.086 --> 01:03:51.390
I never have, but I should
be afraid to try it.

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:53.192
You'll be exquisite.

01:03:53.326 --> 01:03:54.859
Allow me to guide you.

01:03:54.993 --> 01:03:58.463
It's very simple
and highly exhilarating.

01:03:58.596 --> 01:04:00.465
Oh, Viscount.

01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:24.622
Hey, Stevie, it's me again.

01:04:24.756 --> 01:04:26.124
You must still be out of range.

01:04:26.258 --> 01:04:27.859
Uh, I just wanted
to let you know

01:04:27.993 --> 01:04:29.794
that I just found
your tin fish.

01:04:29.928 --> 01:04:31.963
It was under the couch.

01:04:32.097 --> 01:04:33.531
Anyway, I bet
you're having more fun

01:04:33.665 --> 01:04:36.001
catch and releasing real fish.

01:04:36.135 --> 01:04:38.237
Can't wait to see you tomorrow.

01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:41.973
Okay, love you. Bye.

01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.928
Hi, Stevie.

01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:05.897
You must be out of range.

01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:09.468
Uh, I just wanted to remind you
to wear your life jacket.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:11.569
I hope the fish are biting.

01:05:28.154 --> 01:05:29.120
Ice water.

01:05:29.255 --> 01:05:31.089
I wasn't sure you'd show.

01:05:31.223 --> 01:05:32.624
Why not?

01:05:32.757 --> 01:05:33.958
When something
like this happens,

01:05:34.092 --> 01:05:36.761
you must be
one of the usual suspects.

01:05:36.895 --> 01:05:39.498
Thought you'd be lying low.

01:05:39.631 --> 01:05:40.632
There's no ice.

01:05:40.765 --> 01:05:42.600
If you want ice,
then pay for it.

01:05:42.734 --> 01:05:45.371
Room temperature is fine.

01:05:45.504 --> 01:05:48.039
Any damage to the stadium?

01:05:48.174 --> 01:05:49.908
What stadium?

01:05:52.311 --> 01:05:54.380
There's been an explosion
at Fitzroy Gardens.

01:05:54.513 --> 01:05:56.614
One person is dead.

01:05:58.616 --> 01:06:01.153
Uh, barkeeper, ice.

01:06:05.723 --> 01:06:08.561
Electronic interference.

01:06:08.693 --> 01:06:10.862
Left his phone on.

01:06:10.995 --> 01:06:12.864
Somebody called him.

01:06:14.567 --> 01:06:17.702
So this is what you wanted
to tell me about?

01:06:17.836 --> 01:06:20.038
Not primarily, no.

01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:21.906
That's not very hygienic.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.110
If you don't like it,
you know where the door is.

01:06:27.779 --> 01:06:30.081
I want to register an assault

01:06:31.616 --> 01:06:33.486
within our group.

01:06:33.618 --> 01:06:35.387
Somebody assaulted you?

01:06:35.521 --> 01:06:36.955
Conrad Verloc.

01:06:43.027 --> 01:06:46.132
Are you all right there,
Assistant Commissioner?

01:06:46.265 --> 01:06:48.334
You're not in your corner office
anymore, Toto.

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:50.302
Would you like us
to pause proceedings,

01:06:50.436 --> 01:06:51.370
Assistant Commissioner?

01:06:51.504 --> 01:06:53.139
No, please continue.

01:06:53.272 --> 01:06:55.608
Apparently, the cops on-scene
had to use a shovel.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:57.008
That's enough of that, Matthew.

01:06:57.143 --> 01:06:58.643
Extreme damage to the mandible

01:06:58.776 --> 01:07:00.346
will complicate identification.

01:07:00.479 --> 01:07:03.648
Traces of saltpeter, sulfur,
and charcoal

01:07:03.781 --> 01:07:05.451
on the burnt flesh
would indicate

01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:10.054
that this was a very rudimentary
explosive device.

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:13.825
Preliminary examination
of the remains.

01:07:13.958 --> 01:07:15.461
First significant lead.

01:07:15.594 --> 01:07:17.929
Homemade gun powder.

01:07:18.062 --> 01:07:21.600
I don't think we need to jump
to conclusions, Kylie.

01:07:21.733 --> 01:07:25.271
Who's jumping to conclusions,
Assistant Commissioner?

01:07:29.007 --> 01:07:32.076
Were there any belongings
found with the remains?

01:07:32.211 --> 01:07:34.112
Matthew?

01:07:36.915 --> 01:07:38.750
Cooked phone.

01:07:38.883 --> 01:07:39.918
Great, thank you.

01:07:40.051 --> 01:07:41.853
I'll, uh, get my team on to it,

01:07:41.986 --> 01:07:43.589
see what they can make of it.

01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:45.924
Gentlemen.
Assistant Commissioner.

01:08:41.513 --> 01:08:43.582
- Give me the phone.
- What are you gonna do with it

01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:45.015
that I can't do with it?

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:46.884
- We need to ID the victim.
- No, we don't,

01:08:47.018 --> 01:08:49.087
'cause you already know
who it is.

01:08:51.624 --> 01:08:54.024
And there's someone
that you and your department

01:08:54.158 --> 01:08:56.662
were supposed to be
keeping a close eye on.

01:08:56.794 --> 01:08:58.863
Bullshit, who?

01:08:58.997 --> 01:09:01.133
That information's
currently classified.

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.067
Classified, are you joking?

01:09:03.202 --> 01:09:05.470
If it's somebody
on the special crimes database,

01:09:05.604 --> 01:09:08.072
- then I need to know who it is!
- Enough, you fucked up.

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:10.408
Accept it, you are off the case,

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:12.344
pending
an internal investigation.

01:09:12.478 --> 01:09:14.812
- Now, give me the phone.
- How can you be so sure

01:09:14.946 --> 01:09:16.781
- who it is?
- Leave it.

01:09:16.913 --> 01:09:21.118
Kylie, this is way beyond
your pay scale and expertise.

01:09:21.252 --> 01:09:22.554
Phone.

01:09:26.057 --> 01:09:27.925
You always were a prick.

01:09:31.697 --> 01:09:33.299
Is your pussy still purring?

01:09:35.501 --> 01:09:37.502
What did you say?

01:09:37.636 --> 01:09:39.103
I kept the text.

01:09:40.673 --> 01:09:42.006
"Can't sleep.

01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.310
A loud noise
is keeping me awake.

01:09:44.443 --> 01:09:47.613
It's my pussy still purring from
the strokes of your hard cock.

01:09:47.746 --> 01:09:48.912
Kiss, kiss, kiss."

01:09:49.046 --> 01:09:50.814
- Delete it.
- Sorry.

01:09:52.518 --> 01:09:54.453
Already archived.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.868
I was lying.

01:10:11.002 --> 01:10:13.439
I've licked harder
clit than your cock.

01:10:23.014 --> 01:10:25.384
Come on, pick up, pick up.

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.553
I can see you're online,
fucking answer.

01:10:46.572 --> 01:10:49.174
- Was it done?
- You haven't heard?

01:10:49.308 --> 01:10:51.543
Well, officially
I'm uncontactable.

01:10:51.677 --> 01:10:54.912
It's done, but there's been
some collateral damage.

01:10:55.046 --> 01:10:57.149
One casualty.

01:10:57.282 --> 01:10:59.151
What was it you said,
"A victimless atrocity

01:10:59.284 --> 01:11:00.452
will win you votes"?

01:11:00.586 --> 01:11:02.920
I knew that was
a fucking oxymoron.

01:11:03.054 --> 01:11:04.490
It's the planter.

01:11:06.358 --> 01:11:08.394
- He dead?
- Very.

01:11:09.961 --> 01:11:10.995
Well, that's some consolation.

01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:13.532
Is there a wife or family?

01:11:13.665 --> 01:11:15.099
A girlfriend.

01:11:15.234 --> 01:11:17.669
You find out what she knows.

01:11:18.437 --> 01:11:20.572
Are we still going to
affiliate him with Black Bloc?

01:11:20.706 --> 01:11:22.775
I've been thinking about that,
now that he's dead,

01:11:22.907 --> 01:11:25.811
it might be safer
to brand him the "Lone Wolf."

01:11:25.943 --> 01:11:27.246
Yeah, I could spin that.

01:11:27.379 --> 01:11:30.014
Fear of the anonymous
and unaffiliated.

01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:32.785
But, what happens
if it comes out

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:34.720
that he was a police informant?

01:11:34.853 --> 01:11:36.321
Well, it'll just
strengthen your call

01:11:36.455 --> 01:11:38.190
for expanded dataveillance.

01:11:38.323 --> 01:11:40.692
You make it a campaign promise,

01:11:40.826 --> 01:11:42.294
humans can't be trusted.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:45.130
But binary coding doesn't lie.

01:11:45.264 --> 01:11:47.299
I'd still need a scalp.

01:11:47.433 --> 01:11:49.134
Well, naturally
we'll be announcing

01:11:49.268 --> 01:11:51.035
an internal investigation.

01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.172
No, I said a scalp,
not a fucking haircut.

01:11:55.307 --> 01:11:58.042
And in case this has missed you,

01:11:58.177 --> 01:12:00.412
this has happened on your watch.

01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.182
Well, in theory,
the incompetence

01:12:03.315 --> 01:12:06.017
needn't rise any higher
than his case officer.

01:12:06.785 --> 01:12:09.120
Oh, you'd pimp your own mother,
wouldn't you?

01:12:09.254 --> 01:12:11.088
Yeah, in theory, Kylie'll do,

01:12:11.223 --> 01:12:14.326
but if we need one more scalp,
you're next up the totem pole.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:16.528
- Keep that in mind.
- But, this investigation

01:12:16.662 --> 01:12:19.264
is now your personal
responsibility, all right?

01:12:19.431 --> 01:12:21.032
You do your questioning alone.

01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:22.835
Do not delegate, do not brief,

01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:25.704
or discuss this matter
with anyone except for me.

01:12:33.445 --> 01:12:34.746
Switching to thermal vision.

01:12:46.291 --> 01:12:49.161
One male occupant,
no other heat sources yet.

01:12:51.263 --> 01:12:52.865
What are you doing
sitting in the dark, Karl?

01:12:52.997 --> 01:12:55.234
Namaskar, I was meditating.

01:12:55.367 --> 01:12:58.102
You need to wait
for the "all clear," sergeant.

01:12:58.237 --> 01:13:01.240
Anything I should be
worried about, Karl?

01:13:01.373 --> 01:13:04.209
In here, no,
it's clean as a whistle.

01:13:04.343 --> 01:13:05.811
I can turn on a lamp
if you want.

01:13:05.944 --> 01:13:07.713
No, it's all right.

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:10.849
I'll wait till the officer's
finished his searching.

01:13:10.983 --> 01:13:13.685
May he find his path of bliss.

01:13:13.819 --> 01:13:16.053
Who's gonna pay
to get my door fixed?

01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:19.224
Device is homemade,
right up your alley.

01:13:19.358 --> 01:13:20.526
Who's the deceased?

01:13:23.662 --> 01:13:26.365
- Who's the deceased?
- Jumpy.

01:13:26.498 --> 01:13:29.066
You really don't know, huh?

01:13:29.201 --> 01:13:31.236
Out of the loop again.

01:13:32.004 --> 01:13:34.806
- What loop?
- Boy's club.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:37.342
You know, me and your,
uh, ex boyfriend,

01:13:37.476 --> 01:13:41.045
now assistant commissioner,

01:13:41.179 --> 01:13:43.482
go way back.

01:13:46.652 --> 01:13:48.487
Give me a name.

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.856
All right, whoa, whoa, whoa,
just easy.

01:13:50.989 --> 01:13:53.090
The name of the deceased
is Verloc,

01:13:53.225 --> 01:13:55.059
Conrad Verloc.

01:14:13.879 --> 01:14:17.215
Not answering my calls
isn't gonna do you any good.

01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:19.518
I've just had
ministerial approval.

01:14:19.651 --> 01:14:21.820
You're suspended
from all official duties,

01:14:21.954 --> 01:14:23.989
effective immediately.

01:14:24.121 --> 01:14:27.659
Go home and stay home, Kylie.

01:14:27.793 --> 01:14:30.629
If I see hide or hair of you,
I'll have you charged

01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:32.731
with obstructing
a police investigation.

01:15:01.026 --> 01:15:02.828
You're not a customer, are you?

01:15:05.397 --> 01:15:06.632
No, I'm not.

01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:10.002
Are you Vladimir?

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:11.703
I know Vladimir.

01:15:15.407 --> 01:15:17.075
Is Conrad here?

01:15:17.209 --> 01:15:18.644
No.

01:15:20.412 --> 01:15:21.913
You know where he is?

01:15:22.047 --> 01:15:23.882
He's still in Sydney.

01:15:24.016 --> 01:15:25.484
He gets back tomorrow.

01:15:27.919 --> 01:15:29.121
You'll get your money's worth,
if that's what

01:15:29.254 --> 01:15:30.322
you're worried about.

01:15:32.491 --> 01:15:34.459
I'm worried about yours.

01:15:40.832 --> 01:15:42.567
Come back tomorrow.

01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:09.227
- He's got a migraine.
- Let me speak to him.

01:16:09.361 --> 01:16:11.329
No, he needs his rest.

01:16:11.463 --> 01:16:13.098
Listen,
you fucking little rent boy,

01:16:13.231 --> 01:16:15.267
put the minister on right now.

01:16:22.908 --> 01:16:25.077
How dare you speak
to Toodles like that.

01:16:25.210 --> 01:16:27.412
I'm sorry, it's late,
and I'm tired.

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:29.047
I made contact
with the girlfriend,

01:16:29.182 --> 01:16:31.483
she seems totally in the dark
about what's happened.

01:16:31.616 --> 01:16:33.552
She's expecting him home
tomorrow.

01:16:33.685 --> 01:16:35.454
Did you enlighten her?

01:16:37.589 --> 01:16:39.291
Well, I thought
I'd check with you first.

01:16:39.424 --> 01:16:41.194
Let her put
two and two together

01:16:41.326 --> 01:16:43.162
tomorrow when he's a no show.

01:16:43.295 --> 01:16:45.297
She'll be more susceptible.

01:16:50.635 --> 01:16:54.339
- Do you know who that was?
- Customer?

01:16:54.473 --> 01:16:56.308
The Assistant Commissioner
of Police.

01:16:56.441 --> 01:16:58.376
You didn't recognize him
from the news?

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:00.479
I don't watch the news.

01:17:05.417 --> 01:17:08.620
Winnie, you need to disappear.

01:17:13.391 --> 01:17:15.961
Alright, you can take your
fake police badge and leave.

01:17:16.094 --> 01:17:18.864
I'm telling Conrad
you're banned from the shop.

01:17:18.997 --> 01:17:21.533
Conrad's gone.

01:17:21.666 --> 01:17:23.502
Gone, gone where?

01:17:25.837 --> 01:17:28.373
She's trying to tell me
she's from the police.

01:17:33.512 --> 01:17:34.980
Why aren't you in Sydney?

01:17:37.616 --> 01:17:39.284
I'll explain everything,
I just need to

01:17:39.417 --> 01:17:41.486
speak to her alone for a moment.

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:46.057
Oh.

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:53.732
You look like death warmed up.

01:17:54.766 --> 01:17:57.136
Yeah, well I don't feel warm.

01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:59.138
There are human remains
in the morgue

01:17:59.272 --> 01:18:01.240
that I have been assured
are yours.

01:18:01.373 --> 01:18:02.507
How would they
know that already?

01:18:02.641 --> 01:18:04.476
Well, they don't, obviously.

01:18:04.609 --> 01:18:06.145
But, why do they think it's you?

01:18:06.279 --> 01:18:07.879
I wish it was.

01:18:09.881 --> 01:18:11.783
Oh, Jesus.

01:18:11.917 --> 01:18:14.686
You can arrest me now,
I'll go quietly, I swear to God.

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:20.293
Disappear, disappear, Conrad.

01:18:20.425 --> 01:18:21.827
They already think that
you're out of this world.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:24.529
Well, a simple DNA test
will dispel that.

01:18:24.663 --> 01:18:26.898
I don't wanna dispel it.

01:18:27.399 --> 01:18:28.134
Don't you get it?

01:18:28.267 --> 01:18:30.035
They're behind it.

01:18:32.370 --> 01:18:33.839
What?

01:18:36.074 --> 01:18:37.609
Conrad, you were set up,

01:18:39.077 --> 01:18:41.346
by my superiors,

01:18:41.479 --> 01:18:43.615
somehow.

01:18:46.185 --> 01:18:47.986
I don't know.

01:18:48.119 --> 01:18:50.689
I had nothing to do with that,
I was just a scapegoat.

01:18:50.822 --> 01:18:53.358
- You have to...
- Get out!

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:01.167
They had to gather up
his body with a shovel.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.203
Oh, get out of here!

01:19:04.337 --> 01:19:05.971
Hey, Stevie.

01:19:06.104 --> 01:19:07.539
Uh, it's me.

01:19:07.672 --> 01:19:10.075
Hope you're having fun
sleeping in a tent.

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:13.145
Can't wait to hear all about it
when you get home tomorrow.

01:19:13.279 --> 01:19:15.348
Love you, bye.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:17.250
...an explosion
minutes before dawn

01:19:17.382 --> 01:19:19.951
and killed one person.

01:19:25.258 --> 01:19:28.194
The surrounding streets
have been cordoned off,

01:19:28.327 --> 01:19:32.365
and area
for all the emergency vehicles.

01:19:32.497 --> 01:19:33.965
What do you make
of the evacuation

01:19:34.099 --> 01:19:36.067
and lockdown down
at the MCG?

01:19:36.202 --> 01:19:37.502
The police are saying
that this was

01:19:37.636 --> 01:19:39.437
merely a precautionary measure.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.775
Stevie, it's me again.

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:47.012
I'm leaving you
tons of messages, I know.

01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:48.314
Look, Stevie, you don't...
you don't need to

01:19:48.446 --> 01:19:50.115
listen to them all, just, um...

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:53.286
just give me a call back as soon
as you get into reception.

01:19:53.418 --> 01:19:56.188
Okay, love you.

01:20:00.725 --> 01:20:04.696
I never meant him
to come to any harm, Winnie.

01:20:04.829 --> 01:20:07.266
Stevie's on a fishing trip
with Father Michaelis.

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:10.669
...any situation has been
a reason and cause...

01:20:10.802 --> 01:20:12.504
He's not anymore,
I collected him.

01:20:15.274 --> 01:20:17.310
You wouldn't do that.

01:20:17.442 --> 01:20:21.213
...wasn't the EMCG
but that the explosive device

01:20:21.347 --> 01:20:22.714
that malfunctioned en route

01:20:22.847 --> 01:20:25.151
thankfully only killing
the perpetrators.

01:20:30.088 --> 01:20:33.024
All they had to do was
put a brown paper bag in a bin.

01:20:33.159 --> 01:20:35.328
- Simple.
- Then, why didn't you do it?

01:20:37.495 --> 01:20:40.465
He told me he wanted him
to be useful.

01:20:44.236 --> 01:20:45.837
Stevie, answer the phone.

01:20:47.406 --> 01:20:48.773
He's not gonna pick up.

01:20:52.777 --> 01:20:54.479
What is done can't be undone.

01:20:54.612 --> 01:20:56.715
So, we're gonna focus,
and it's gonna be okay

01:20:56.848 --> 01:20:58.550
'cause they're
not gonna charge me.

01:20:59.951 --> 01:21:02.887
They might want me to testify,

01:21:03.021 --> 01:21:05.123
'cause I've got
too much to reveal.

01:21:05.257 --> 01:21:08.026
They're gonna say that
Stevie did it all alone

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.562
on a whim.

01:21:10.695 --> 01:21:12.630
You'd do that to him as well.

01:21:12.764 --> 01:21:15.967
We got... we got
$300,000 donation.

01:21:18.270 --> 01:21:19.504
We could go anywhere.

01:21:19.637 --> 01:21:21.973
Asia, what you've
always dreamt of.

01:21:24.276 --> 01:21:27.112
I'm gonna put it in the ceiling
above the bed, okay?

01:22:28.174 --> 01:22:31.810
The human mating ritual
we are observing

01:22:31.943 --> 01:22:34.112
is common in these parts.

01:22:36.182 --> 01:22:40.252
I never have, but I shouldn't
be afraid to try it.

01:22:40.386 --> 01:22:42.787
They're on the move.

01:22:42.921 --> 01:22:46.192
We'll try to follow

01:22:46.325 --> 01:22:49.195
without spooking them.

01:22:54.666 --> 01:22:57.602
Note that it is the female

01:22:57.735 --> 01:22:59.704
that is highly decorative,

01:22:59.838 --> 01:23:01.606
whereas the male

01:23:01.739 --> 01:23:04.343
has dark, plain coloring, and...

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:08.613
This is Stevie, please leave
a message after the beep.

01:24:10.543 --> 01:24:12.244
Should I light your fire?

01:24:14.946 --> 01:24:16.482
You're in shock, Winnie,
you're not thinking straight.

01:24:16.615 --> 01:24:18.016
- Come on.
- I don't wanna think straight.

01:24:18.150 --> 01:24:20.352
Just try and go to sleep.

01:24:22.154 --> 01:24:23.922
Winnie, try and sleep.

01:24:29.894 --> 01:24:31.796
Winnie, please stop.

01:26:35.321 --> 01:26:37.556
I just needed some fresh air.

01:26:40.693 --> 01:26:42.795
We could go out for a drive
if you like.

01:26:42.927 --> 01:26:44.496
Hm.

01:26:46.332 --> 01:26:47.965
Can't take me where I wanna go.

01:26:49.702 --> 01:26:52.404
Try me.

01:26:52.538 --> 01:26:54.872
Are you sure?

01:26:56.408 --> 01:26:59.043
Take the B35 to Port Augusta

01:26:59.178 --> 01:27:01.146
to the Stuart Highway,

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:03.014
to Alice Springs, Tennant Creek,

01:27:03.148 --> 01:27:04.849
all the way up.

01:27:06.218 --> 01:27:09.020
And go in with our man
with a boat.

01:27:09.154 --> 01:27:10.622
Hop, skip, and a jump.

01:27:10.756 --> 01:27:12.191
Southeast Asia.

01:27:14.693 --> 01:27:16.462
He didn't deserve you
when he was alive, Winnie.

01:27:17.763 --> 01:27:19.131
He doesn't deserve you now.

01:27:21.734 --> 01:27:23.135
That's why you're here.

01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:29.641
You knew what I'd have to do.

01:27:29.775 --> 01:27:32.177
There's 300,000 upstairs.

01:27:32.311 --> 01:27:34.580
It's in the ceiling
above the bed.

01:27:34.713 --> 01:27:36.615
300 grand?

01:27:36.749 --> 01:27:38.384
Cash?

01:27:38.517 --> 01:27:41.587
Enough to get us
to Asia undetected.

01:27:43.555 --> 01:27:44.723
Fuck.

01:28:00.372 --> 01:28:02.241
Ugh!

01:28:50.955 --> 01:28:52.291
Yes?

01:28:52.424 --> 01:28:53.958
I'm on the premises.

01:28:54.091 --> 01:28:55.561
And?

01:28:55.694 --> 01:28:58.530
Winnie's disappeared,
but her boyfriend's here.

01:28:58.664 --> 01:29:01.533
He's lying on the bed with
a screwdriver in his throat.

01:29:01.667 --> 01:29:02.701
Dead.

01:29:05.002 --> 01:29:07.139
How the hell does that work?

01:29:07.272 --> 01:29:09.208
I'm not sure yet.

01:29:10.975 --> 01:29:12.711
Well, make it work.

01:30:19.244 --> 01:30:21.947
Not open till 7:00.

01:30:22.079 --> 01:30:23.515
What time is it now?

01:30:25.417 --> 01:30:27.819
It's going 4:00.

01:30:27.953 --> 01:30:29.488
The hour of the wolf.

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:34.526
He lured him out of our home
and he murdered him.

01:30:36.929 --> 01:30:38.530
As good as, yes.

01:30:39.765 --> 01:30:41.366
As good as?

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:45.203
Wasn't his intention,
but the crime's the same.

01:30:47.806 --> 01:30:49.508
I want Stevie back.

01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:07.593
That day we had at the beach,

01:31:07.726 --> 01:31:09.528
the three of us.

01:31:13.198 --> 01:31:15.067
Sacred.

01:31:16.702 --> 01:31:19.004
Sacred?

01:31:19.137 --> 01:31:21.139
Yeah, sacred.

01:31:24.776 --> 01:31:26.178
Your brother was...

01:31:27.579 --> 01:31:29.848
Your brother is
a truly unique soul.

01:31:32.351 --> 01:31:34.620
You don't have to worry for him.

01:32:09.755 --> 01:32:11.490
No.

01:32:14.926 --> 01:32:16.561
I feel filthy.

01:32:49.261 --> 01:32:52.030
And your jacket's not vinyl!

01:34:36.501 --> 01:34:39.437
All right, are we ready?

01:34:39.571 --> 01:34:41.940
The chief finding
of the initial report

01:34:42.073 --> 01:34:45.677
released today into
the Fitzroy Gardens explosion

01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:48.281
is that it was a discreet
and fortunately

01:34:48.413 --> 01:34:49.881
misdirected crime.

01:34:50.015 --> 01:34:52.517
It was not part
of a wider terrorist plot

01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:54.853
or campaign,
and was not affiliated

01:34:54.986 --> 01:34:57.856
with any known
terrorist organization.

01:34:57.989 --> 01:35:01.426
It was, in short,
a desperate, isolated act

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.230
by an individual,
a disturbed individual,

01:35:04.362 --> 01:35:06.464
acting alone.

01:35:06.598 --> 01:35:08.834
A lone wolf.

01:35:08.967 --> 01:35:11.703
Now, at my request,
the Assistant Commissioner

01:35:11.837 --> 01:35:14.273
personally oversaw
the investigation of this crime,

01:35:14.406 --> 01:35:16.608
so I'd like to thank him,
take this opportunity

01:35:16.741 --> 01:35:19.811
to thank him
for his tireless efforts

01:35:19.945 --> 01:35:23.548
and the prompt completion
of this investigation.

01:35:23.748 --> 01:35:26.585
However, the fact remains,

01:35:26.718 --> 01:35:29.387
the Assistant Commissioner
and his chain of command

01:35:29.521 --> 01:35:32.924
should have been aware
of Conrad Verloc's activities

01:35:33.058 --> 01:35:34.327
and intentions.

01:35:34.459 --> 01:35:36.061
They should've been aware.

01:35:36.195 --> 01:35:39.097
But, despite ongoing contact
with the deceased,

01:35:39.232 --> 01:35:40.665
they remained in the dark,

01:35:40.799 --> 01:35:42.500
unable to preempt or prevent.

01:35:42.634 --> 01:35:44.803
They remained in the dark

01:35:44.936 --> 01:35:48.874
because the current
individual privacy legislation

01:35:49.007 --> 01:35:52.311
in this state prevents them
and security agencies

01:35:52.444 --> 01:35:55.281
from keeping you safe.

01:35:55.413 --> 01:35:57.582
Which is why, when reelected,

01:35:57.716 --> 01:36:00.018
I will introduce legislation

01:36:00.152 --> 01:36:02.520
that extends
the dataveillance network

01:36:02.654 --> 01:36:04.456
of the police
and security agencies

01:36:04.589 --> 01:36:07.058
in the war against terror.

01:36:07.193 --> 01:36:09.794
This bombing has been
a wakeup call for all of us,

01:36:09.928 --> 01:36:11.463
especially in the light
of Melbourne

01:36:11.596 --> 01:36:14.032
hosting the upcoming G20 Summit.

01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:17.169
Make no mistake,

01:36:17.303 --> 01:36:19.938
they are coming after us.

01:36:20.071 --> 01:36:22.841
- Thank you, no questions.
- Fucking liars!

01:36:23.742 --> 01:36:25.543
When are you gonna announce
the Royal Commission?

01:36:25.677 --> 01:36:27.213
- No... no... no questions.
- The Royal Commission

01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:29.781
into the circumstances of
the Fitzroy Gardens explosion.

01:36:29.915 --> 01:36:32.251
We are satisfied that
the internal investigation...

01:36:32.385 --> 01:36:34.786
Kylie Heat, former sergeant,
special crimes division.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.856
I demand a Royal Commission
into the circumstances

01:36:37.989 --> 01:36:39.658
of Conrad Verloc's death!

01:36:39.791 --> 01:36:41.127
...authorization, Ms. Heat.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.695
His girlfriend, her brother,
where are they?

01:36:43.828 --> 01:36:47.699
Where are they?
I demand a Royal Commission!

01:36:47.832 --> 01:36:50.101
- Where are they?
- Apologies for that.

01:36:50.236 --> 01:36:52.971
Uh, Ms. Heat has been
finding it difficult

01:36:53.104 --> 01:36:56.208
to readjust following
voluntary redundancy.

01:36:56.342 --> 01:36:57.509
- When did Kylie Heat resign?
- Thank you,

01:36:57.642 --> 01:36:59.044
ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:00.779 --> 01:37:03.149
You stupid cunt, how the fuck
did she get in here?

01:37:03.282 --> 01:37:04.916
- You're still wearing your mic.
- Who are the girlfriend

01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:06.319
and the brother?

01:37:24.869 --> 01:37:26.972
I'm sure it hasn't escaped you

01:37:27.105 --> 01:37:29.574
that you don't come out of this
very well either.

01:37:31.377 --> 01:37:33.312
That's a price
I'm prepared to pay.

01:37:33.446 --> 01:37:36.081
What, in seeking justice
for a murderer

01:37:36.215 --> 01:37:38.317
who's vanished?

01:37:38.451 --> 01:37:40.118
Gone missing,

01:37:40.252 --> 01:37:43.222
and manslaughter at best.

01:37:43.356 --> 01:37:45.690
Winnie's only real crime
is trusting men.

01:37:45.824 --> 01:37:47.525
She couldn't give 'em up.

01:37:48.626 --> 01:37:52.131
You see yourself
as a reflection of her,

01:37:52.264 --> 01:37:54.933
don't you,
her avenging double,

01:37:55.066 --> 01:37:58.237
- yeah?
- If you like.

01:37:58.371 --> 01:38:00.206
Mm.

01:38:00.373 --> 01:38:02.174
Except you're not
her avenging double, are you?

01:38:02.308 --> 01:38:04.109
Otherwise you wouldn't
be putting me through

01:38:04.243 --> 01:38:06.011
this show and tell.

01:38:07.645 --> 01:38:10.249
You'd have gone public,
it'd be all over the media.

01:38:10.383 --> 01:38:12.650
We'd be behind bars.

01:38:13.985 --> 01:38:15.987
So, what do you
really want from this?

01:38:24.463 --> 01:38:26.097
I'll take his job.

01:38:32.003 --> 01:38:35.174
Well, I'm all for
equality in the workplace.

01:38:35.307 --> 01:38:37.143
I campaigned on it.

01:38:39.311 --> 01:38:40.912
When can you start?

01:38:42.614 --> 01:38:43.815
Now.

01:38:44.883 --> 01:38:46.885
I'll take your job, too.

01:38:47.186 --> 01:38:48.987
90 minutes ago
that file was sent out

01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:51.589
to every media outlet
in the country.

01:38:55.794 --> 01:38:57.595
There it is,

01:38:57.729 --> 01:38:59.298
the look we've been after.

01:39:01.167 --> 01:39:03.668
The "I'm well
and truly fucked" look.

01:39:07.306 --> 01:39:09.607
Goodbye, hubris.
