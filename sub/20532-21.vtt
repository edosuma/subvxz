00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.543 --> 00:12.511
<i> ¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:14.880
<i> ¶ Then I became</i>
<i> a princess overnight ¶</i>

00:14.882 --> 00:17.616
<i> ¶ Now I gotta figure out</i>
<i> how to do it right ¶</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:19.885
<i> ¶ So much to learn</i>
<i> and see ¶</i>

00:19.887 --> 00:22.554
<i> ¶ Up in the castle</i>
<i> with my new family ¶</i>

00:22.556 --> 00:25.290
<i> ¶ In a school</i>
<i> that's just for royalty ¶</i>

00:25.292 --> 00:29.495
<i> ¶ A whole enchanted world</i>
<i> is waiting for me ¶</i>

00:29.497 --> 00:33.565
<i> -¶ I'm so excited to be ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:36.670 --> 00:37.903
<i>¶ Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:37.905 --> 00:39.671
<i> ¶ Making my way ¶</i>

00:39.673 --> 00:42.841
<i> -¶ It's an adventure</i>
<i> every day ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:42.843 --> 00:45.477
<i> -¶ It's gonna be my time ¶</i>
<i> -¶ Sofia ¶</i>

00:45.479 --> 00:51.550
<i> ¶ To show them all</i>
<i> that I'm Sofia the First ¶</i>

00:58.893 --> 01:01.493
[Sofia reads]

01:01.495 --> 01:05.330
[Baileywick]
We need more flowers
for the flower sculptures!

01:05.332 --> 01:08.367
More chocolate
for the chocolate waterfall!

01:08.369 --> 01:10.335
[Amber] Oh, I love weddings!

01:10.337 --> 01:11.437
I don't.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.172
Having to greet
all those people?

01:13.174 --> 01:14.740
How am I supposed to remember

01:14.742 --> 01:16.442
everyone's name
and where they're from?

01:16.444 --> 01:18.610
Don't worry, James,
you're going to do great!

01:18.612 --> 01:19.945
I'll help you practice.

01:19.947 --> 01:23.749
Okay, How will you greet
the king of the Kobolds?

01:23.751 --> 01:27.619
Uh, I'll-- I'll bow
and move my arms like
they're ocean waves!

01:27.621 --> 01:30.789
No, James, that's how you greet
the queen of the mermaids.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.792
You greet Kobalds
with their traditional
foot stomp, remember?

01:33.794 --> 01:37.896
Oh! Whatever you do,
don't touch their hair.

01:37.898 --> 01:39.698
Kobalds really
don't like that.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.600
Why did Aunt Tilly
have to invite

01:41.602 --> 01:43.969
so many different creatures
to her wedding, anyway?

01:43.971 --> 01:45.804
Uh, because she's
Aunt Tilly?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.973
And why is it my job
to greet them?

01:47.975 --> 01:50.943
Because, James, you're going
to be king one day,

01:50.945 --> 01:53.645
and that's one of your duties
as heir to the throne.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.914
Oh, right.
Well, I guess doing

01:55.916 --> 01:58.650
all this boring stuff will be
worth it once I'm king.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.220
Come on, James, it's
Aunt Tilly's wedding.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.821
It's going to be fun.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.057
¶ Incoming! ¶

02:05.059 --> 02:06.992
Aunt Tilly, do you
have wings?

02:06.994 --> 02:10.662
That's a very observant
observation you observed,

02:10.664 --> 02:12.731
and the answer is yes!

02:12.733 --> 02:15.834
But I can make them come
and go as I please.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.469
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

02:17.471 --> 02:18.904
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

02:18.906 --> 02:20.305
That's incredible!

02:20.307 --> 02:23.175
Isn't it?
This is a Whenever Wings wand,

02:23.177 --> 02:25.277
and I've been testing it out
all morning

02:25.279 --> 02:26.812
for a little surprise
I planned.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.847
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

02:28.849 --> 02:30.816
Sir Bartleby and I
want to make sure

02:30.818 --> 02:32.284
our wedding is memorable.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.652
I'm sure it will be!

02:33.654 --> 02:37.022
Your Majesties, it is time
for the royals to gather

02:37.024 --> 02:38.824
for the official
wedding portrait.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.492
Right this way,
please.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.594
Sofia, since you were the one

02:42.596 --> 02:44.796
who brought Sir Bartleby
and me together,

02:44.798 --> 02:47.833
I was hoping you would be
my maid of honor today.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.168
Of course, Aunt Tilly!

02:49.170 --> 02:51.436
I'd be, well, honored!

02:51.438 --> 02:54.806
Whiz-bang, here's your first
maid-of-honor assignment.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.843
Hold on to my Whenever Wings
wand until the ceremony,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.478
then when I give
you the signal,

02:59.480 --> 03:01.180
I'll need you to...
[whispers]

03:01.182 --> 03:03.615
Oh! That will be fun!

03:03.617 --> 03:07.152
Grand-queen, please stand
next to the bride,

03:07.154 --> 03:08.854
flanked by the king
and queen.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.690
Children, you're up front,

03:11.692 --> 03:13.592
heir to the throne
in the center.

03:15.129 --> 03:16.795
Oh, no, no, no, no.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.163
That's all wrong!

03:18.165 --> 03:20.732
Amber, you stand
in the middle.

03:20.734 --> 03:24.303
But, mother, the middle spot
is for the future king.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.538
No, I'm afraid not!

03:26.540 --> 03:28.707
You two need to switch.

03:28.709 --> 03:32.077
James is not next in line
to the throne,

03:32.079 --> 03:33.745
Amber is.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.746
I am?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.747
She is?

03:35.749 --> 03:37.049
Wait, what?

03:37.051 --> 03:38.884
I thought James
was going to be king.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.119
So did I.
So did everyone!

03:42.556 --> 03:43.922
Don't worry, children,

03:43.924 --> 03:45.824
we'll get this
all straightened out.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.893
Mother, I'm afraid
you are mistaken.

03:47.895 --> 03:51.029
The firstborn son
inherits the throne,

03:51.031 --> 03:52.764
like I did!

03:52.766 --> 03:56.868
Oh, but Roland, dear, that is
not how the law is written.

03:56.870 --> 04:00.872
Mum is right.
It's the firstborn child
who gets to rule.

04:00.874 --> 04:04.776
Indeed! Amber and James
may be twins,

04:04.778 --> 04:07.913
but Amber is
seven minutes older.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.082
Making her
the future queen!

04:12.753 --> 04:15.053
I just can't
believe any of this!

04:15.055 --> 04:17.956
Oh, then I'll show you.
Follow me!

04:17.958 --> 04:20.092
[giggling] Oh!

04:21.362 --> 04:23.161
Let me see.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.799
Here we are!
Heir to the throne.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.102
"Rulership of the kingdom

04:30.104 --> 04:31.970
shall be passed down

04:31.972 --> 04:34.573
from generation
to generation..."

04:34.575 --> 04:37.576
"From firstborn child
to firstborn child!"

04:37.578 --> 04:40.312
That-- that's me!
I was born first!

04:40.314 --> 04:42.381
Yeah, we know that.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.582
But how can this be?

04:43.584 --> 04:45.250
If that's the law,

04:45.252 --> 04:48.253
then Tilly would've been offered
the throne instead of me.

04:48.255 --> 04:50.589
Well, truth be told,
I was.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.658
-[all] You were?
-That's right.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.993
Many years ago,
I was offered the crown,

04:54.995 --> 04:56.895
but I
couldn't accept it.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.798
I knew I wanted
to be an adventurer,

04:59.800 --> 05:03.101
and that my baby brother
would make a much better king.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.071
But why didn't anyone
ever tell me?

05:06.073 --> 05:08.473
Because we knew
that being king

05:08.475 --> 05:10.409
was all
you ever wanted,

05:10.411 --> 05:12.311
and your father
and I knew

05:12.313 --> 05:15.414
that it was all
you could ever do.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.916
I guess that's true...

05:17.918 --> 05:20.118
And we knew you'd be
great at it.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.854
Maybe being king
is all<i> I</i> ever wanted!

05:22.856 --> 05:24.823
Did anyone ever think of that?

05:24.825 --> 05:28.160
I'm so very sorry, son,
but the law is the law.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.862
James, you don't even like
doing most of the things

05:30.864 --> 05:34.032
a king has to do--
you said it's boring!

05:34.034 --> 05:36.301
And you think you're
going to be a good queen?

05:36.303 --> 05:39.004
You've always been more worried
about how you look in your tiara

05:39.006 --> 05:41.306
than how the people
in the kingdom are doing!

05:41.308 --> 05:43.842
Well, I'm not
like that anymore.

05:43.844 --> 05:47.379
James, I understand
this is difficult to hear.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.948
No, you don't
understand, Dad!

05:49.950 --> 05:51.283
You got to be king!

05:56.056 --> 05:57.889
[James] Not how
the law's written!

05:57.891 --> 06:00.058
Well, this is what I think
of that law!

06:00.060 --> 06:00.959
Hyuh!

06:00.961 --> 06:03.061
-Take that, law!
-[Sofia] James?

06:03.063 --> 06:04.496
Are you okay?

06:04.498 --> 06:07.332
Sofia, I just went
from being the future king

06:07.334 --> 06:08.867
to the future nothing,

06:08.869 --> 06:11.737
so, no,
I'm not feeling so great.

06:11.739 --> 06:15.040
I'm so sorry. I can't imagine
how that must feel.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.576
I spent my whole life
thinking I'd grow up

06:17.578 --> 06:19.578
to protect our kingdom
from bad guys,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.380
all that great king stuff!

06:21.382 --> 06:23.882
Well, that's not
all a king does.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.385
Now I'll never get
to protect the kingdom.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.887
Maybe you can just find
another way to do that

06:28.889 --> 06:31.022
without being king.

06:31.024 --> 06:34.092
Yeah, maybe I can.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.694
That's the spirit!

06:35.696 --> 06:37.429
I'll go work
on that right now!

06:37.431 --> 06:39.431
Okay, good luck!

06:39.433 --> 06:42.701
Oh, that was way easier
than I thought it would be.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.336
Sofia's right.

06:44.338 --> 06:47.005
I can protect
the kingdom

06:47.007 --> 06:49.040
by making sure
Enchancia doesn't get

06:49.042 --> 06:52.444
a selfish, self-centered queen
like Amber.

06:52.446 --> 06:55.380
Now, Princess Amber,
as heir to the throne,

06:55.382 --> 06:57.716
you have lots
of important wedding duties--

06:57.718 --> 06:59.918
greeting the guests,
presenting the cake...

06:59.920 --> 07:03.288
...and holding on
to Sir Bartleby's wedding ring
for safekeeping.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.691
It's one of a kind,
just like Sir Bartleby.

07:06.693 --> 07:09.728
I need you to keep it safe
until it's time for me

07:09.730 --> 07:11.797
to give it to him
at the wedding ceremony.

07:11.799 --> 07:16.201
Ah! I'll guard this
with all of my future
queen abilities.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.543
I never thought
this day would come,

07:24.545 --> 07:29.247
but now that it has,
it just feels so right!

07:29.249 --> 07:33.785
¶ I've always loved
being a princess ¶

07:33.787 --> 07:35.954
¶ The gowns,
the balls ¶

07:35.956 --> 07:38.657
¶ The jewels galore ¶

07:38.659 --> 07:41.226
¶ But I started to wonder ¶

07:41.228 --> 07:46.131
¶ What else life
has in store ¶

07:46.133 --> 07:51.169
¶ And now I see
there's something more ¶

07:51.171 --> 07:53.138
¶ I will be queen ¶

07:53.140 --> 07:55.340
¶ That's the path for me ¶

07:55.342 --> 07:57.776
¶ I've always known
deep down ¶

07:57.778 --> 08:00.011
¶ That it was
meant to be ¶

08:00.013 --> 08:02.447
¶ Enchancia's queen ¶

08:02.449 --> 08:04.816
¶ It is clear to see ¶

08:04.818 --> 08:08.453
¶ That I was born
to rule ¶

08:08.455 --> 08:12.324
¶ Yes, it was meant to be ¶

08:13.260 --> 08:15.827
¶ I have so much ¶

08:15.829 --> 08:18.096
¶ I know I could offer ¶

08:18.098 --> 08:20.298
¶ I'll help the folks ¶

08:20.300 --> 08:23.001
¶ Across our land ¶

08:23.003 --> 08:26.037
¶ And I can't wait
to tell them ¶

08:26.039 --> 08:30.175
¶ Everything
I've planned ¶

08:30.177 --> 08:35.313
¶ The future will be
so great and grand ¶

08:35.315 --> 08:37.315
¶ I will be queen ¶

08:37.317 --> 08:39.718
¶ That's the path for me ¶

08:39.720 --> 08:42.120
¶ I've always known
deep down ¶

08:42.122 --> 08:44.322
¶ That it was meant to be ¶

08:44.324 --> 08:46.958
¶ Enchancia's queen ¶

08:46.960 --> 08:49.127
¶ It is clear to see ¶

08:49.129 --> 08:52.631
¶ That I was born
to rule ¶

08:52.633 --> 08:57.102
¶ Yes, it was meant to be ¶

08:58.672 --> 09:00.906
¶ I'm the one
who was supposed to ¶

09:00.908 --> 09:03.141
¶ End up on the throne ¶

09:03.143 --> 09:04.876
¶ Supposed to run this land ¶

09:04.878 --> 09:07.679
¶ And make the rules
all on my own ¶

09:07.681 --> 09:09.481
¶ If I show them all ¶

09:09.483 --> 09:12.918
¶ That Amber's
nothing but a fool ¶

09:12.920 --> 09:14.753
¶ They have got to see ¶

09:14.755 --> 09:19.491
¶ I'm far more fit to rule ¶

09:19.493 --> 09:21.760
-¶ I will be queen ¶
-¶ I will be king ¶

09:21.762 --> 09:24.062
¶ That's the path for me ¶

09:24.064 --> 09:26.565
¶ I've always known
deep down ¶

09:26.567 --> 09:28.767
¶ That it was
meant to be ¶

09:28.769 --> 09:31.369
-¶ Enchancia's queen ¶
-¶ Enchancia's king ¶

09:31.371 --> 09:33.371
¶ It is clear to see ¶

09:33.373 --> 09:36.942
¶ That I was born
to rule ¶

09:36.944 --> 09:42.514
¶ Yes, it was meant to be ¶

09:42.516 --> 09:46.284
¶ Meant to be ¶

09:46.286 --> 09:52.357
¶ Yes, it was meant to be ¶

10:01.101 --> 10:02.567
Now remember,
Princess Amber,

10:02.569 --> 10:04.302
it's the heir
to the throne's job

10:04.304 --> 10:07.539
to greet wedding guests
in the custom
of their own land.

10:07.541 --> 10:10.208
Yes, Baileywick. Ahem!

10:12.145 --> 10:13.278
[laughing]

10:13.280 --> 10:15.313
I've been practicing
these for weeks!

10:15.315 --> 10:18.483
They're really hard,
and there's no way Amber
will know them all.

10:18.485 --> 10:22.854
Introducing the King and Queen
of Trufflandia!

10:24.491 --> 10:27.459
[both]<i> Bon jour monsieur!</i>
<i> Faisons la fete!</i>

10:28.762 --> 10:31.262
Okay, she made
a lucky guess.

10:31.264 --> 10:34.265
Sooner or later,
her luck will run out.

10:34.267 --> 10:36.134
Royals from Freezenberg?

10:36.136 --> 10:40.138
Their Majesties, the King
and Princess of Freezenberg!

10:40.140 --> 10:43.041
[all shivering]

10:44.111 --> 10:45.143
Too easy.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.444
[James] Mermaids?

10:46.446 --> 10:49.314
Her Royal Highness
of Merroway Cove,

10:49.316 --> 10:50.482
Queen Emmeline!

10:50.484 --> 10:51.816
[horse neighs]

10:55.255 --> 10:57.122
Nah, she
already knows that one.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.490
What are you doing?

10:58.492 --> 11:01.159
Making sure everyone sees
that Amber doesn't deserve

11:01.161 --> 11:02.961
to be the heir to the throne.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.429
James, you can't do that!

11:04.431 --> 11:08.299
Oh, yeah?
Watch me.

11:08.301 --> 11:11.970
Gnomes? Hmm. I could never
remember their greeting!

11:11.972 --> 11:13.171
Perfect!

11:14.374 --> 11:17.709
Uh, please follow me,
King, uh...

11:17.711 --> 11:19.344
King Viridian!

11:19.346 --> 11:21.179
Hmm, yes, I knew that.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.947
You get
a front-of-the-line pass.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.315
Follow me, sir.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.718
I really don't think
this is a good idea.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.019
You're right, Sofia.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.320
I need to raise the bar

11:29.322 --> 11:31.523
and stump Amber
with some centaurs.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.960
Follow me, folks,
and you, too, giants.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.263
I didn't even know
giants had royals.

11:41.735 --> 11:44.335
Princess Amber,
these nice folks

11:44.337 --> 11:46.738
would like to receive
their royal greeting.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.206
Good luck.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.742
King Viridian
of the Gnomes!

11:50.744 --> 11:53.578
Please accept
my warmest welcome.

11:53.580 --> 11:58.116
[both yodeling]

12:01.421 --> 12:04.055
[speaks Gaelic]

12:04.057 --> 12:08.426
[laughs, speaks Gaelic]

12:08.428 --> 12:10.762
[heavy footfalls]

12:10.764 --> 12:14.232
Hail, hail!
My heart is open to you!

12:14.234 --> 12:16.334
[growly voice]
And mine to you.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.870
What? How did she know--?

12:18.872 --> 12:20.572
Come on, James,
you know she aced

12:20.574 --> 12:22.273
Majestic Formalities
at Royal Prep.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.409
But that was
the most boring class ever!

12:24.411 --> 12:27.779
Not for Amber.
She really loves
that boring stuff,

12:27.781 --> 12:29.781
and it's part of
being king or queen.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.418
Well, if I was king,
I could've learned to like it,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.521
but I guess that's never
gonna happen now.

12:36.523 --> 12:41.860
Princess Amber, you are
doing a fantastic job
representing the royals.

12:41.862 --> 12:42.894
Thank you,
Aunt Tilly!

12:42.896 --> 12:44.262
I've greeted
all the guests,

12:44.264 --> 12:45.396
presented the cake,

12:45.398 --> 12:48.299
and I still have your ring
safe and sound.

12:48.301 --> 12:52.203
Whiz-bang! Amber, you are going
to make a great queen.

12:52.205 --> 12:55.907
[sighs] I am so sick
of hearing people say that.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.276
Sofia!
There you are.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.112
I have another important task
for my maid of honor.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.614
Sure, Aunt Tilly.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.116
It's almost time
for the wedding ceremony.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.419
When I give the signal,
I'd like you to release

13:08.421 --> 13:10.655
this flock
of beautiful wedding...

13:10.657 --> 13:13.391
Doves? Oh, I love doves!

13:13.393 --> 13:16.261
Not doves, dear.
Doves are so ordinary.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.896
We're releasing...

13:18.899 --> 13:20.832
flying fish!

13:20.834 --> 13:25.637
Oh! Fish. That's a little...
unexpected.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.739
This could be my chance
to show everyone

13:27.741 --> 13:30.341
there's no way Amber
could make a good queen!

13:30.343 --> 13:33.144
Sofia, I'll need you to keep
a close eye on these critters.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.979
Keep them safe
in their little home,

13:34.981 --> 13:39.150
and when I give the signal,
let them soar into the sky!

13:39.152 --> 13:40.151
Got it!

13:40.153 --> 13:41.519
That sounds like

13:41.521 --> 13:43.421
a perfect job
for the heir to the throne!

13:43.423 --> 13:44.956
What are you talking
about, James?

13:44.958 --> 13:46.958
Aunt Tilly asked
Sofia to do it.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.495
Oh, I'm sorry, so you don't
think you can handle it?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.498
Of course I can
handle it! [scoffs]

13:53.500 --> 13:57.168
I would be honored to take care
of your fish, Aunt Tilly.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.703
That's fine with me.

13:58.705 --> 14:02.106
Okay! Then I'm sure
their fins are in good hands.

14:02.108 --> 14:04.275
Duchess Tilly?
May I have a moment?

14:04.277 --> 14:06.344
Ooh! It's almost time.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.781
Meet us by the ceremony tent
in a few minutes.

14:09.783 --> 14:13.284
I'm glad to see you've
come around to the idea
of Amber being queen.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.986
Oh, y-yeah,
I'm over that.

14:14.988 --> 14:18.489
Hey, isn't that
your wombeast friend?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.859
It is!
Hi, Wilbur!

14:21.995 --> 14:24.696
Uh-oh. Amber,
your tiara is crooked!

14:24.698 --> 14:26.197
Oh! Dear.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.002
Hi, little guys?
Who wants to get out early?

14:31.004 --> 14:32.570
[gasps] You all do?

14:32.572 --> 14:33.905
Okay!

14:33.907 --> 14:35.640
[laughing]

14:37.210 --> 14:38.643
Amber, the fish!

14:39.713 --> 14:40.812
Oh, no!

14:42.983 --> 14:45.650
Pardon me!
I'm terribly sorry.

14:45.652 --> 14:47.185
Come back, fish!

14:47.187 --> 14:49.754
As your future queen,
I command you to--

14:49.756 --> 14:51.656
-[gasps]
-Oh, no!

14:51.658 --> 14:55.026
[blubbers]
Oh, my hair!

14:55.028 --> 14:58.196
Princess Amber,
the king of the Kobalds!

14:58.198 --> 14:59.764
You touched his hair!

14:59.766 --> 15:04.769
Oh, Your Majesty,
I'm so, so sorry.

15:04.771 --> 15:08.273
I'll help fix it
once I get the fish.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.609
Wow! Princess Amber
sure messed that up!

15:11.611 --> 15:13.711
Prince James
to the rescue!

15:13.713 --> 15:15.713
[Amber struggling]

15:15.715 --> 15:18.416
Careful, Amber, you might
get your dress dirty!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.784
Oh, it doesn't matter!

15:19.786 --> 15:21.519
I'm doing this
for Aunt Tilly!

15:21.521 --> 15:22.687
Oh! Gotcha!

15:25.458 --> 15:28.593
Wow, Amber doesn't care
if her dress gets dirty?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.028
That's right.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.397
She's not the pampered princess
she used to be!

15:32.399 --> 15:33.464
Is that all of them?

15:33.466 --> 15:35.300
No! I see more!

15:35.302 --> 15:38.603
Here, little fishies! Ha!

15:38.605 --> 15:40.071
[gasps]

15:40.073 --> 15:41.472
The wedding ring!

15:45.478 --> 15:47.111
No!

15:50.216 --> 15:51.616
It's gone!

15:51.618 --> 15:53.618
Oh, this is a disaster!

15:53.620 --> 15:55.486
I didn't mean for that
to happen.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.656
The day started off
so well,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.492
but then I messed
everything up!

16:01.494 --> 16:03.294
I let Aunt Tilly's
fish get out,

16:03.296 --> 16:06.097
and I touched
the Kobald king's hair!

16:06.099 --> 16:08.399
And then Aunt Tilly's ring!

16:08.401 --> 16:10.301
I lost it!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.270
You're being too hard
on yourself, Amber.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.772
Yeah, I mean, this may not
be<i> all</i> your fault.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.607
Of course it is!

16:16.609 --> 16:18.509
Look at all the damage
I caused

16:18.511 --> 16:21.412
in just a few hours
as heir to the throne!

16:21.414 --> 16:23.414
I'd probably destroy
the whole kingdom

16:23.416 --> 16:26.084
if I ever became queen,
which is why...

16:26.086 --> 16:27.685
[sighs] I won't!

16:27.687 --> 16:31.356
I'm not the right person
to rule Enchancia.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.490
What are you saying?

16:32.492 --> 16:33.491
He is.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.525
You don't mean--

16:34.527 --> 16:35.693
I do.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.595
If Aunt Tilly
gave up the throne,

16:37.597 --> 16:38.529
so can I.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.164
James can be king.

16:40.166 --> 16:43.368
From now on,
you're heir to the throne.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.535
I quit.

16:44.537 --> 16:45.636
Amber, wait.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.272
Young royals,
you're needed right away.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.775
The ceremony
is about to begin.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.543
Might as well tell
everyone the news,

16:52.545 --> 16:56.547
and tell Aunt Tilly
that I've lost
her special ring.

16:58.551 --> 16:59.684
Aren't you coming?

16:59.686 --> 17:02.520
You need to take over
the heir-to-the-throne duties.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.621
I guess.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.123
James, what's wrong?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.292
You're going to be king!

17:08.294 --> 17:09.627
Isn't that what you wanted?

17:09.629 --> 17:11.996
I thought so,
but now...

17:11.998 --> 17:13.364
What is it?

17:13.366 --> 17:15.233
I have to tell you
something, Sofia.

17:15.235 --> 17:18.970
I'm the reason Amber
messed things up.

17:18.972 --> 17:21.372
I let the flying fish
out of their home.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.174
James, how could you!

17:23.176 --> 17:25.810
I know, I don't deserve
to be king,

17:25.812 --> 17:28.046
and Amber does deserve
to be queen.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.680
You have to tell her!

17:29.682 --> 17:31.182
You have
to make things right!

17:31.184 --> 17:32.850
But even if I tell her,

17:32.852 --> 17:34.852
I've still lost
Aunt Tilly's ring.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.654
[fish fussing]

17:36.656 --> 17:39.357
-[gasps] There it is!
-Let's get it!

17:39.359 --> 17:42.160
You still have that magic
wing-giving thingy, right?

17:42.162 --> 17:44.996
The Whenever Wings wand? Yes.

17:44.998 --> 17:46.230
Brilliant!

17:46.232 --> 17:48.366
Wait, James, Tilly said
not to use it.

17:48.368 --> 17:49.734
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

17:50.603 --> 17:52.036
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

17:52.038 --> 17:53.204
What are you doing?

17:53.206 --> 17:54.605
Trying to give
the ring wings

17:54.607 --> 17:56.574
so it'll fly up
out of the water.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.909
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

17:57.911 --> 18:00.011
Agh, but it
won't stay still!

18:00.013 --> 18:01.913
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

18:01.915 --> 18:04.348
Ah... don't worry.
I'll get it.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.084
Or you might hit
something else!

18:06.086 --> 18:08.586
-I think you should stop--
-I did it!

18:10.223 --> 18:11.789
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

18:11.791 --> 18:14.692
[Baileywick]
Children, please, the ceremony!

18:14.694 --> 18:16.627
We've got to get
this to Amber!

18:16.629 --> 18:18.763
Before she tells everyone
she won't be queen!

18:18.765 --> 18:20.298
Let's go!

18:26.739 --> 18:27.705
[James] Amber, no!

18:27.707 --> 18:30.408
-We have the ring!
-You do?

18:30.410 --> 18:32.443
And you're still
the heir to the throne!

18:32.445 --> 18:33.511
I am?

18:35.815 --> 18:36.914
[growls]

18:36.916 --> 18:39.317
[gasps] Oh, no!

18:39.319 --> 18:41.252
What in the kingdom
is that?!

18:41.254 --> 18:43.254
[gasps] It's a kondraki!

18:43.256 --> 18:45.756
Wait, kondrakis
don't have wings!

18:45.758 --> 18:47.658
Well, this one does.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.893
[screaming]

18:48.895 --> 18:52.163
Everyone, take cover
under the tables!

18:52.165 --> 18:54.532
[centaur speaking Gaelic]

18:56.636 --> 18:59.103
Where did that thing
come from?

18:59.105 --> 19:01.739
James, I think you gave
that kondraki wings

19:01.741 --> 19:03.307
with the Whenever Wings wand.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.676
I know, Sofia. We've got
to change it back!

19:05.678 --> 19:07.178
<i>Flutterous terminus!</i>

19:07.180 --> 19:09.747
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

19:09.749 --> 19:12.116
Oh, he's too far away
and moving too fast!

19:12.118 --> 19:13.351
What do we do?

19:13.353 --> 19:14.485
We need a plan.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.786
Don't look at me!

19:15.788 --> 19:17.955
I was a disaster
as the future leader.

19:17.957 --> 19:20.324
You weren't
a disaster, Amber.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.425
You were great!

19:21.427 --> 19:22.960
Oh, what are you
talking about?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.529
I messed everything up!

19:24.531 --> 19:26.697
[sighs] Only because I set
the fish loose

19:26.699 --> 19:28.766
and did everything else
I could think of

19:28.768 --> 19:30.101
to make things
harder for you.

19:30.103 --> 19:31.469
You what?

19:31.471 --> 19:35.039
I'm really,
really sorry, Amber.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.675
I thought you
shouldn't be queen,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.877
but now I see
you're great at it.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.313
You even like doing
the boring stuff.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.382
So I didn't really
mess things up?

19:44.384 --> 19:46.617
No, you were amazing.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
Thank you, Sofia.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.688
Okay, people, we have
a kondraki to stop

19:50.690 --> 19:51.789
and a wedding to save.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.791
Sofia, I need you
to find Aunt Tilly

19:53.793 --> 19:55.960
and Sir Bartleby and make sure
they're all right.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.462
-Okay.
-I'll help keep
the wedding guests safe.

19:58.464 --> 20:00.665
And James-- ugh.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.832
I know
what he can do!

20:01.834 --> 20:02.900
[whispers]

20:02.902 --> 20:05.336
Oh! Yes!

20:05.338 --> 20:09.040
James, we could really use
your knight skills.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.107
Got it!

20:12.245 --> 20:13.511
Are you two okay?

20:13.513 --> 20:14.845
Oh, we're fine, Sofia,

20:14.847 --> 20:17.515
but I don't remember
inviting a kondraki.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.883
[Sofia] What does he
even want!?

20:18.885 --> 20:24.188
[growling] Ugh, cake! Cake!

20:24.190 --> 20:26.891
Cake? He's just after
some cake?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.726
Most kondrakis
do have a sweet tooth.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.828
Ugh! I've got
to tell Amber!

20:30.830 --> 20:32.496
[speaking Gaelic]

20:32.498 --> 20:34.532
Amber! Amber!

20:34.534 --> 20:36.500
The kondraki!

20:36.502 --> 20:38.169
I think it's
after the wedding cake!

20:38.171 --> 20:40.438
Guard, go protect the cake!

20:43.343 --> 20:45.710
Cake! Cake!

20:45.712 --> 20:47.945
Guards! Cut a slice of cake,

20:47.947 --> 20:50.948
and we can use some
to lure him away.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.283
But just one piece,

20:52.285 --> 20:55.686
because dessert is really
for the invited guests.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.255
-[kondraki growling]
-James!

20:57.257 --> 21:00.391
See if you can get him
to follow you away
from the wedding!

21:00.393 --> 21:03.294
Hey, kondraki!
You want cake?

21:03.296 --> 21:05.796
I got cake for ya!

21:05.798 --> 21:07.898
Ugh! I can't get
his attention!

21:07.900 --> 21:09.533
I need to get closer!

21:09.535 --> 21:11.035
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

21:12.238 --> 21:14.605
Whoa, brilliant!

21:14.607 --> 21:15.773
Go get him, James!

21:18.311 --> 21:20.778
Yoo-hoo! You want
some cake?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.213
Follow me!

21:22.215 --> 21:23.681
Go, James, go!

21:32.158 --> 21:34.659
It's all yours, kondraki!

21:35.595 --> 21:37.028
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

21:43.803 --> 21:45.336
You did it, Sofia!

21:45.338 --> 21:46.437
We all did it!

21:46.439 --> 21:48.773
<i> Flutterous terminus!</i>

21:48.775 --> 21:50.641
[Roland] Sofia! James!

21:50.643 --> 21:52.310
That was fantastic!

21:52.312 --> 21:55.946
You were braver
than the bravest knight!

21:55.948 --> 21:57.848
You protected us all.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.751
James, you said you wanted
to protect the kingdom

22:00.753 --> 22:03.154
without doing any
of the boring king stuff.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.789
Why don't you be a knight?

22:04.791 --> 22:07.124
Yeah, maybe you're right!

22:07.126 --> 22:10.695
Actually, I think
that's all I've ever
really wanted to be!

22:10.697 --> 22:13.998
Enchancia will be lucky
to have such a brave defender.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.868
In fact, my first act as queen

22:17.870 --> 22:22.506
is to declare you
First Knight of the Realm!

22:22.508 --> 22:24.308
That's very sweet,

22:24.310 --> 22:27.945
but, Amber, I'm afraid
you cannot do that.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.314
Not until you are
officially queen.

22:30.316 --> 22:33.818
Oh! Well,
then when I become queen,

22:33.820 --> 22:35.686
it will be
my first act.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.122
Um, guys? As Tilly's
maid of honor,

22:38.124 --> 22:40.191
I should
probably remind you

22:40.193 --> 22:42.526
we need to make sure
she gets married today!

22:42.528 --> 22:44.695
-That's true.
-Whoops!

22:45.798 --> 22:47.998
And do you, Duchess Matilda,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.868
take Sir Bartleby
to be your husband?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.003
I do.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.072
Then, by the power
vested in me

22:55.074 --> 22:57.408
by King Roland
of Enchancia,

22:57.410 --> 23:00.878
I now pronounce you
husband and wife!

23:00.880 --> 23:02.813
Or as we like
to call you,

23:02.815 --> 23:05.149
adventurer and knight!

23:05.151 --> 23:06.584
Huzzah, Tilly.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.319
[crying] Oh...

23:08.321 --> 23:12.323
-And I said I wouldn't cry!
-Yay!

23:12.325 --> 23:15.559
-[whispers]
-Now? Uh, okay!

23:15.561 --> 23:17.561
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

23:17.563 --> 23:19.563
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

23:21.234 --> 23:22.900
[crowd] Whoa!

23:22.902 --> 23:24.702
[applause]

23:24.704 --> 23:26.904
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

23:26.906 --> 23:28.606
<i>Flutterous featherus!</i>

23:31.043 --> 23:33.611
<i> Flutterous featherus!</i>

23:35.081 --> 23:37.748
