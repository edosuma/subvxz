WEBVTT

00:12.167 --> 00:14.700
Narrator: Coming up,
why is Q doing a face

00:14.700 --> 00:18.467
This is basil.
Yeah.

00:18.467 --> 00:21.233
What's got Sal
starting a dance party?

00:21.233 --> 00:22.600
? Yeah.

00:23.567 --> 00:24.700
Narrator: And which losing Joker

00:24.700 --> 00:29.300
will be walking dead
in tonight's punishment?

00:29.300 --> 00:32.000
Sal: Prepare for
something amazing.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.800
Q:
Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:35.333 --> 00:36.933
Murr: I want my mommy!

00:38.600 --> 00:40.600
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:40.600 --> 00:42.767
Joe: Larry!

00:46.833 --> 00:49.033
Today, we're working at
the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

00:49.033 --> 00:51.033
While interacting with visitors,
we're gonna have to do

00:51.033 --> 00:53.100
and say whatever
the other guys tell us to.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.933
If you refuse anything,
you know, you lose.

00:59.367 --> 01:02.233
Murr, you look like a bad
attempt at a cover of, like,

01:02.233 --> 01:04.267
a romance novel.

01:04.267 --> 01:05.733
Ooh!

01:05.733 --> 01:06.700
Joe:
Look at this kid's hair.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.533
Great hair, man.
Great hair.

01:08.533 --> 01:10.233
That's not real.

01:10.233 --> 01:11.433
That's your real hair?

01:11.433 --> 01:13.433
Say, "This isn't mine,"
and take your wig off.

01:13.433 --> 01:15.967
That's your real hair?
This isn't mine.

01:19.067 --> 01:20.100
Go try to take his off!

01:20.100 --> 01:21.633
You're not gonna
get one over on me!

01:21.633 --> 01:24.500
-Come on. Come on.
-It's real.

01:24.500 --> 01:25.967
-It's real.
-Oh, it's real.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.967
-Yeah.
-All right.

01:28.967 --> 01:32.067
Guys, smell this.
Fresh basil we just got.

01:32.067 --> 01:34.400
This one's elephantis
clitoris.

01:35.867 --> 01:38.467
Oh, you want to try?
This is the elephantis clitoris.

01:38.467 --> 01:41.133
These are the, uh,
this is basil.

01:41.133 --> 01:42.100
Let me show you another one.

01:42.100 --> 01:44.267
Stick 'em up, dickweed.

01:44.267 --> 01:45.333
Try -- these
are very fragrant.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.267
This is the
stick 'em up, dickweed.

01:47.267 --> 01:49.567
-Yeah.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.233
She just said it back.

01:51.233 --> 01:53.667
Right? Stick 'em up, dickweed.
Basil.

01:53.667 --> 01:57.467
Stick 'em up, dickweed.
Basil.

01:57.467 --> 01:58.700
Hey. What are you
doing here?

01:58.700 --> 02:00.200
Uh, prepping new
flowers to be planted.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.333
Oh, fantastic.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.167
Murr, punch a flower
as hard as you can.

02:03.167 --> 02:04.700
I live out of the country
most of the time.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.733
Oh, is that right?
Whereabouts?

02:05.733 --> 02:07.500
Turkey, Bulgaria,
and Holland.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.633
Yeah.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.800
How long have you been
back in the United States?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.733
Well, just almost back
for three years.

02:14.733 --> 02:16.567
Yeah.

02:16.567 --> 02:17.600
And back in the 1970's...

02:17.600 --> 02:19.267
He's talking
right through it!

02:19.267 --> 02:22.900
...I worked on a project
for the environment people.

02:22.900 --> 02:24.600
I worked for
the Parks Department.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.867
Oh, you worked for
the Parks Department?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.067
Oh, you want to
take a hit then?

02:27.067 --> 02:28.833
You used to work for
the Parks Department?

02:28.833 --> 02:29.933
So you're allowed.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.367
You want to take a swing
at this then, too?

02:31.367 --> 02:32.767
Um...
Come on. Come on.

02:32.767 --> 02:35.067
That's it.
There you go.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.200
That's a good hit.
Um...

02:36.200 --> 02:39.133
And then he goes
right back into talking!

02:42.433 --> 02:44.833
-He just...
-And he's still talking!

02:44.833 --> 02:47.533
duking it out here.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.967
I worked at
the Parks Department!

02:49.967 --> 02:51.233
That's it.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.067
Q: Joe, see this couple
right in front of you?

02:56.067 --> 02:57.400
Offer to take a photo of them.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.833
Do you guys want to take
a picture of you with the...

02:58.833 --> 02:59.800
Sure.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.567
Yeah. You had
the camera out.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.600
Ready?

03:04.467 --> 03:05.467
There you go.
Thank you.

03:05.467 --> 03:07.200
Okay. Enjoy your day
in the garden.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.467
-Joey...
-Mm-hmm.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.867
You want to see if they want
a picture with that now?

03:09.867 --> 03:14.200
Yeah, that's a good one.
I'll take a picture for you.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.167
Ready?

03:15.167 --> 03:16.633
There you go.
Thank you.

03:16.633 --> 03:19.567
Joe go, "All right, I'll see you
in 15 steps," and walk away.

03:19.567 --> 03:23.167
Okay, I'll see you
in 15 steps.

03:25.367 --> 03:26.533
There he goes.

03:26.533 --> 03:27.533
You have to do
the fountain.

03:27.533 --> 03:28.533
-Yeah, the fountain.

03:28.533 --> 03:29.533
You want to sit down
on this one.

03:29.533 --> 03:30.667
This is the best way.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.900
-Oh, okay.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.567
Just go, "I'll wait for you

03:34.567 --> 03:35.633
over there in the..."

03:35.633 --> 03:37.200
I'll wait for you
right over here.

03:41.567 --> 03:44.767
Joe, see if you can get
a selfie of the three of you.

03:44.767 --> 03:48.800
Look at her face.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.633
Ready? 2, 3...

03:51.633 --> 03:52.500
Oh, yeah.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.400
Sal: Joe, go up to
this guy in the hat...

03:58.400 --> 03:59.267
-Mm-hmm.
-...and just hold him

03:59.267 --> 04:01.333
by the hips.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.400
The cider gum...
This one.

04:12.633 --> 04:13.833
Come over to
the lavender-cotton

04:13.833 --> 04:15.100
right after that.

04:15.100 --> 04:17.900
-This is so weird!
-Right there. Lavender-cotton.

04:21.333 --> 04:25.467
Joe, we got a bucket filled
with water and a sponge.

04:25.467 --> 04:27.800
Just walk around and offer
to cool people down.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.300
-No, we're good.

04:36.767 --> 04:38.367
Wet sponge?

04:39.633 --> 04:42.567
-He can't process it.

04:42.567 --> 04:44.233
Who...
It's just not making sense.

04:44.233 --> 04:46.467
...would turn down
a wet sponge?

04:50.867 --> 04:53.233
Wet sponge?

04:53.233 --> 04:54.667
No?

04:57.900 --> 04:59.700
Hi. How you doing?

04:59.700 --> 05:01.967
You ever been to
the Botans before?

05:01.967 --> 05:04.133
Ohhh, man.

05:04.133 --> 05:06.333
Oh, really?
Where you from?

05:06.333 --> 05:08.533
And you came -- You didn't get
enough green  in Dublin?

05:08.533 --> 05:11.633
You had to come here?
To see this?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.867
Lily garden?
Oh, that's up -- that's --

05:17.867 --> 05:19.833
Up your Irish ass,
to the left!

05:19.833 --> 05:23.467
Now, as I recall,
that is...um...yeah.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.600
The lily garden.
That is, uh, right.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.767
That is up your Irish ass,
to the left.

05:27.767 --> 05:29.667
Right over there.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.867
Joe: Flipped him off!
He flipped him off!

05:31.867 --> 05:33.967
He flipped him off!

05:33.967 --> 05:36.333
Hi. Would you like
to sniff a flower?

05:37.767 --> 05:39.167
Shove her face in it.

05:39.167 --> 05:41.533
We got the best,
the most scented one.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.533
Yeah.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.200
Mmm...

05:45.200 --> 05:46.367
Isn't it gorgeous?

05:46.367 --> 05:47.733
Do it again,
do it again.

05:47.733 --> 05:49.933
Yeah.
This is basil.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.067
Yeah. You want
to try some of this?

05:53.067 --> 05:54.567
This is so good. Okay.

05:54.567 --> 05:56.133
There you go.

05:56.133 --> 05:58.633
Q, show them
the penis flytrap.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.200
Yeah, this is -- uh...

06:01.200 --> 06:02.800
Right over -- yeah.

06:07.633 --> 06:10.067
Murr: Q, show them
the penis flytrap.

06:10.067 --> 06:12.633
Yeah, this is -- uh...

06:12.633 --> 06:13.700
Right over -- yeah.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.533
If you see
If you see over here,

06:15.533 --> 06:18.567
we got the peppermint
scented geraniums over here.

06:18.567 --> 06:21.633
Oh, hi, kid. Yeah...

06:21.633 --> 06:24.367
Nothing shuts down a penis
flytrap like a little kid.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.600
See, we keep a bunch
of penis flytraps in here.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.833
The
They're over there.

06:30.833 --> 06:32.400
They're that way. Yeah.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.667
-He said penis.

06:37.667 --> 06:40.067
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, wow.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.933
How's it going, man?

06:43.933 --> 06:45.400
I'm in the midst
of botany, man.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.767
It's my favorite thing
in the world.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.367
I do have
one bigger passion.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.800
You know, I do only have
one bigger passion that botany.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.267
I'm an artist.
I'm a painter.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.167
I'm a painter.
They go hand in hand.

06:55.167 --> 06:57.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, here it's cool.

07:00.833 --> 07:02.433
There's your model, Q.
So, this is...

07:02.433 --> 07:04.233
so on my lunch breaks,
I get to paint my model.

07:04.233 --> 07:06.767
This is my model
right here.

07:06.767 --> 07:08.100
Look at --
Did he make him buff?

07:08.100 --> 07:09.833
I'm almost done
with this one.

07:09.833 --> 07:11.100
What do you think?

07:12.400 --> 07:15.100
This is how I see him.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.567
Look at those
baby-blue eyes.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.067
Look at
the rippling muscles.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.400
That spiky hair,
that Sonic the Hedgehog hair

07:20.400 --> 07:22.467
that he hasn't changed
since high school.

07:24.333 --> 07:26.233
Murr: Q, go up to the easel
and start painting!

07:26.233 --> 07:27.567
While people watch.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.200
Thank you,
thank you.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.700
-Look at Joe's face.
-Crazy person.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.400
There you go. Thanks, buddy.
Oh, back to work for me.

07:45.067 --> 07:47.567
Sal, tell these people a huge

07:47.567 --> 07:48.800
hawk snagged a chipmunk

07:48.800 --> 07:50.100
right there.

07:51.800 --> 07:54.767
**

07:54.767 --> 07:56.367
--
-Oh, my God!

07:57.433 --> 07:59.567
I'm sorry.
Huge  hawk snagged

07:59.567 --> 08:01.100
a chipmunk
over here earlier.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.833
Just be on your look--
just be on the lookout.

08:03.833 --> 08:06.733
Sal, can you scare her again?

08:08.067 --> 08:10.933
**

08:10.933 --> 08:13.333
--
-Oh, my God!

08:13.333 --> 08:16.067
The chipmunk --
chipmunk never had a chance.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.800
She fell for it twice.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.700
How are you two today?

08:23.700 --> 08:25.067
Good. If you have
any questions, let me know.

08:25.067 --> 08:27.133
Ask those two if they're
donors to the park,

08:27.133 --> 08:30.767
and then chastise them
no matter what their answer is.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.833
By any chance, are you guys
donors to the park?

08:32.833 --> 08:34.633
You're not donors?

08:34.633 --> 08:36.167
Interesting.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.067
But you're here
reaping the benefits.

08:40.767 --> 08:42.833
Don't guilt trip you?
I'm not trying to.

08:42.833 --> 08:44.900
I'm just calling it like
I see it. God bless.

08:47.267 --> 08:48.767
Yeah, they were pissed.

08:48.767 --> 08:52.300
Scream across the lawn, "See
those plants? They cost money!"

08:52.300 --> 08:56.833
-S-- S--
-Come on, do it.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.833
Excuse me.
See those plants?

08:59.833 --> 09:01.500
They cost money.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.900
Um...

09:10.900 --> 09:12.367
Murr:
He spotted a camera guy.

09:12.367 --> 09:14.733
I think you mean, like,
sur

09:14.733 --> 09:16.367
Well there's like, this stuff,
and then there's all these

09:16.367 --> 09:17.967
people with,
like, you know,

09:17.967 --> 09:20.400
ear pieces
and backpacks and stuff.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.367
Obama's here today.
Obama's here today.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.100
I think Obama might be here
today or something like --

09:24.100 --> 09:25.833
they were filming something.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.200
-Oh.
-He's volunteering.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.600
-Yeah, yeah.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.133
-Yeah, that's super cool.
-So might catch him.

09:32.167 --> 09:33.167
He's great.

09:33.167 --> 09:35.667
That's right.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.567
Obama. Obama!

09:43.733 --> 09:45.567
What is that?

09:45.567 --> 09:48.267
Wait, what are --
what are you asking me?

09:48.267 --> 09:50.600
What is that?

09:50.600 --> 09:52.500
I have no clue
what that is.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.667
I feel like I failed
you guys with information.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.033
Narrator: Sal didn't
have a green thumb,

10:00.033 --> 10:02.867
so he's first up
on the loser board.

10:02.867 --> 10:04.433
Today, we're teaming up
at Willowbrook

10:04.433 --> 10:06.600
in Wayne, New Jersey,
trying to dip our fries

10:06.600 --> 10:08.833
in a stranger's food
without permission.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.833
One of the guys is gonna
be causing a distraction,

10:10.833 --> 10:13.267
while the other guy
sends his fry in for a dip,

10:13.267 --> 10:14.433
but he can't get caught.

10:14.433 --> 10:16.567
The game continues until
your team gets caught.

10:16.567 --> 10:18.967
The team with
the fewest dips loses.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.167
I just
farted really bad.

10:21.167 --> 10:22.133
-Ahh.
-That's terrible.

10:22.133 --> 10:23.100
-Joe.
-That's terrible.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.267
**

10:26.267 --> 10:28.633
Fries in hand --
two fellas.

10:28.633 --> 10:30.067
We look like
food-courters.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.867
One of them has to distract.

10:31.867 --> 10:33.433
The other person has to dip.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.400
Okay.
They're moving in.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.600
Yeah, you can dip into
some spare teriyak'.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.267
We're in.

10:40.267 --> 10:42.867
Maurine, where the
did you go?

10:42.867 --> 10:45.167
Oh. I was supposed to
meet you in Foot Locker.

10:45.167 --> 10:47.533
You're not --
My apologies. I'm sorry.

10:47.533 --> 10:51.600
Well done!
The ninja dip!

10:51.600 --> 10:57.200
"Maurine, where
the  did you go?"

11:00.400 --> 11:02.067
No. I was looking
for her earlier.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.233
You look exactly like her.

11:03.233 --> 11:04.600
Did you see a woman
who had your black hair...

11:04.600 --> 11:05.933
You're also wearing
the same shirt as Maurine.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.133
...like, a gray shirt
like that?

11:07.133 --> 11:09.233
-Two dips.
-Oh-ho!

11:09.233 --> 11:11.433
Sal: That was risk-ay.
But luckily she turned again.

11:11.433 --> 11:14.067
She had two French fries
on her broccoli.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.900
I mean, it's uncanny how much
you look like Maurine.

11:15.900 --> 11:17.567
Could you just smile so I
could take a picture for her?

11:17.567 --> 11:19.567
-Oh, my God.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.300
-Q, go all in!

11:21.300 --> 11:22.767
Get in, get in.
Here you go. Ready?

11:22.767 --> 11:24.500
Here you go.
Ready? 1, 2, 3...

11:24.500 --> 11:26.167
Mauriiiiine!

11:26.167 --> 11:28.367
That's great.
She's not gonna believe it.

11:28.367 --> 11:31.133
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Three dips on one person.

11:31.133 --> 11:32.567
Well done, guys.

11:33.867 --> 11:35.233
-I got -- I got what you need...

11:35.233 --> 11:39.067
I hear tape being ripped.
I see a roll of duct tape.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.067
Sal: Oh, God.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.267
-I got -- I got what you need...

11:46.267 --> 11:47.933
I hear tape being ripped.

11:47.933 --> 11:51.067
I see a roll of duct tape.
-Okay.

11:51.067 --> 11:53.700
Oh, God.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.967
-This is ballsy.
-My man...

11:54.967 --> 11:58.100
My man...
Quick -- quick solid.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.800
Quick solid.
Help me out with that.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.067
I got... yeah, I got --
Just hel-- yeah.

12:01.067 --> 12:02.500
-Guy's not questioning...
-Pull it out.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.733
-Yeah, go ahead.
-Go!

12:03.733 --> 12:05.733
Yeah, pull it. Out.
Yeah, like that.

12:05.733 --> 12:07.467
-Oh!
-Oh, my God.

12:07.467 --> 12:09.067
Q gets it.

12:09.067 --> 12:12.967
**

12:12.967 --> 12:14.200
She's got a mirror.
Be careful.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.300
She's got a mirror.
Sal: Oh, my God. She does.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.767
Murr: Q, you look
so creepy right now.

12:19.767 --> 12:25.067
**

12:25.067 --> 12:26.633
-Oh, she's looking.
-Oh, she's looking!

12:26.633 --> 12:28.533
She's looking!
Here comes Q!

12:28.533 --> 12:30.067
-Hey...
-Ohhh!

12:30.067 --> 12:31.667
-Ohhh!
-He's caught!

12:33.567 --> 12:35.333
I'll throw this out
for you.

12:35.333 --> 12:36.933
Four dips.

12:36.933 --> 12:40.067
Q: All right.
What happened?

12:40.067 --> 12:41.100
I thought
you weren't eating that.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.300
I thought you were
working out every day.

12:42.300 --> 12:46.067
No, that's done.
Okay.

12:46.067 --> 12:49.600
Here goes Murr.
He brought bubbles.

12:51.567 --> 12:55.367
Murr...blow them that way.

12:55.367 --> 12:57.133
They're coming back at me.

12:59.567 --> 13:01.900
No. Blow them that way.

13:01.900 --> 13:03.533
The air-conditioning's
blowing it back.

13:03.533 --> 13:05.633
Well, this is easy.

13:05.633 --> 13:08.167
I'm gonna walk up here
right now and get the dip.

13:08.167 --> 13:11.067
These two are lined up
and ready to go.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.167
-Okay, Sal...
-Hold on. Let me get a long fry.

13:14.167 --> 13:18.067
-Oh, Murray's got props.
-It's all about distraction.

13:18.067 --> 13:20.067
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

13:21.267 --> 13:23.267
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

13:23.267 --> 13:25.567
Oh!

13:25.567 --> 13:28.067
Sal: There's no way
for me to get that.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.433
Sal?

13:32.433 --> 13:33.600
What the hell, man?

13:33.600 --> 13:35.900
Q: They are not a well-oiled...

13:38.267 --> 13:41.700
Okay, now Murr's dipping.

13:41.700 --> 13:45.067
**

13:45.067 --> 13:46.200
Hey, guys.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.200
You want to see
a nice distraction?

13:48.200 --> 13:50.067
Do you?

13:50.067 --> 13:52.900
This guy knows that
I'm talking about.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.200
This guy right here. See him?

13:55.200 --> 13:57.067
Right there.
-Yeah, I see him.

13:57.067 --> 13:58.600
You guys got this guy
right here?

13:58.600 --> 14:00.667
-I got him!
-There he goes!

14:00.667 --> 14:03.467
-Murray got it!

14:03.467 --> 14:05.067
He got it!
One. One.

14:05.067 --> 14:06.867
He doesn't know!

14:06.867 --> 14:09.433
My man right here doesn't
know what's goin' on!

14:09.433 --> 14:10.833
Hey! He got another one!

14:10.833 --> 14:13.467
Now he's smiling at you!
He's enjoying it!

14:13.467 --> 14:17.067
You guys -- you guys --
You see the guy right here?

14:24.533 --> 14:27.633
-Oh!
-He's caught!

14:27.633 --> 14:30.433
You got caught!
You cocky son of a bitch!

14:30.433 --> 14:33.133
I mean, what is he doing?
Look at this guy.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.633
You're caught,
and you're done.

14:34.633 --> 14:36.067
You cocky bastard.

14:36.067 --> 14:37.900
Narrator:
Sal and Murr got fried,

14:37.900 --> 14:41.133
which makes Sal
tonight's big loser.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.700
Happy day!

14:42.700 --> 14:44.500
We are here on the streets of
Brooklyn for Sal's punishment.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.567
Yes, we are.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.800
Sal, this one
is very, very simple.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.500
Proceed
with caution.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.467
You just have to follow
this caution tape.

14:54.367 --> 14:55.467
-That's it. That's it.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.600
Now I know this is
over the top.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.600
Aw, no. Oh God, no.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.067
-Here we go!
-Here we go, buddy.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.700
Follow that tape.

15:04.167 --> 15:05.300
Oh, no.

15:06.767 --> 15:09.433
That's done.

15:09.433 --> 15:12.400
There's no way
I'm going in there.

15:12.400 --> 15:13.933
Joe: The arrow's
pointed down, right?

15:13.933 --> 15:16.700
-Guys -- guys --
-Come on! Get in there!

15:16.700 --> 15:19.167
This is the easy part, pal.
This is the easy part.

15:19.167 --> 15:21.700
Oh. My. God.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.767
Just get down there!

15:23.767 --> 15:26.100
Oh.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.467
And so it begins!

15:27.467 --> 15:29.067
There he goes.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.333
Look at him going
into the street!

15:31.333 --> 15:32.267
I -- I'm not going.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.267
Why would you do something
that you know I can't do?!

15:37.267 --> 15:40.567
You are halfway in the sewer,
yelling at us!

15:40.567 --> 15:43.833
-Get back in there!
-Come on! Get in there!

15:43.833 --> 15:45.800
**

15:45.800 --> 15:47.433
Oh

15:51.300 --> 15:53.500
I'm scared of heights!
I'm gonna fall!

15:53.500 --> 15:55.400
Keep your tribal
tattoos movin'.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.100
What the  is that?

16:02.067 --> 16:03.867
It's Middle-aged
Karate Tortoise!

16:03.867 --> 16:05.067
Cowabunga, dude.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.433
Sal: How long have you
been standing here?

16:10.433 --> 16:14.867
Actually, Sal, we just
showed up and he was here.

16:14.867 --> 16:18.600
Just stay put.
I might need you.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.667
He has no idea what's waiting
for him in this basement.

16:23.667 --> 16:27.400
-This is creepy.
is this now?

16:29.833 --> 16:32.200
-I see two people in a cage.
-Oh, you should go take a look.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.467
Well, get closer.

16:33.467 --> 16:34.833
Should see who it is
because, you may know them.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.467
Wait, those are my
nieces...

16:41.200 --> 16:44.233
Sal's nieces!
In the cage!

16:44.233 --> 16:46.267
Are you okay?
Why are you here?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.667
All right.
So what's the -- padlock here.

16:53.667 --> 16:54.833
Where's the key?

16:58.600 --> 17:01.167
The key right there,
that's hanging right there?

17:01.167 --> 17:03.067
Well, it looks like you guys
are staying in there.

17:07.300 --> 17:08.767
Oh, my God!

17:11.933 --> 17:14.800
-Oh, my God!
-It's a zombie apocalypse!

17:14.800 --> 17:16.967
Oh! My! God!

17:24.867 --> 17:26.567
Oh, my God!

17:30.067 --> 17:32.733
-Oh, my God!
-It's a zombie apocalypse!

17:32.733 --> 17:36.400
Oh, my God! Oh! My! God!

17:36.400 --> 17:37.800
Joe:
Get on the top of it!

17:37.800 --> 17:40.300
Get away from me,
you sons a bitches!

17:40.300 --> 17:44.467
Oh, you got to be
me right now.

17:44.467 --> 17:48.067
Get the  out of here,
you stupid son of a bitch.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.367
Oh, this is
out of control.

17:50.367 --> 17:52.133
I'm hyperventilating.

17:52.133 --> 17:53.667
Q: Oh, are you gonna let
your nieces get eaten

17:53.667 --> 17:55.200
by these zombies or are you
gonna get that key

17:55.200 --> 17:57.067
and save their life?!

17:57.067 --> 17:59.567
Aah!

17:59.567 --> 18:00.933
We had those fun
conversation like,

18:00.933 --> 18:02.767
"If there's a zombie
apocalypse..."

18:02.767 --> 18:05.733
No. No, I'm not
gonna do anything.

18:05.733 --> 18:10.200
Get the key, Sal!
Get the key!

18:10.200 --> 18:12.067
What the  is this?

18:16.433 --> 18:18.667
Murr: Oh, bud...

18:18.667 --> 18:20.133
-Oh.
-Oh, nice.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.633
-He got it.
-That's it!

18:21.633 --> 18:24.067
But how are you gonna get down?
They're blocking the exit.

18:24.067 --> 18:26.967
people.
-I wish you had some big,

18:26.967 --> 18:30.100
raw meat that you could
throw over the railing.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.067
Oh, God.

18:33.867 --> 18:38.833
Oh, God! Oh, God!
Aah, it's real raw meat!

18:41.567 --> 18:43.600
Q: So, what we're learning is,
in an actual emergency,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.533
Sal's nieces would be dead.

18:45.533 --> 18:46.767
And by the way,
look at how your nieces

18:46.767 --> 18:49.367
are handling this
so much better than you.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.133
-Get it, get it.
-There you go!

18:56.133 --> 18:57.633
-There you go!
-Nice, buddy!

18:57.633 --> 18:59.333
Joe: Get rid of it, buddy.
Throw it over.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.967
Murr:
Distract the zombies!

19:01.967 --> 19:03.567
You hungry, bitches?

19:05.100 --> 19:08.567
-Here we go!
-Here we go, here we go!

19:08.567 --> 19:10.633
You need a weapon, buddy!
You need a weapon!

19:10.633 --> 19:13.833
bat?
-Get it through the head!

19:16.233 --> 19:18.400
-That's how you kill zombies!
-That's how you kill zombies!

19:18.400 --> 19:19.767
Head down!

19:19.767 --> 19:21.067
-There you go, buddy!
-got to him 'em in the head!

19:21.067 --> 19:22.467
Q: You look like
an action hero, buddy!

19:22.467 --> 19:25.067
This is it!
-I'm scared of heights!

19:26.600 --> 19:29.433
My legs are buckling.
I'm scared of heights.

19:29.433 --> 19:30.600
Aah!

19:34.767 --> 19:36.733
-Uh-oh!

19:36.733 --> 19:38.833
-Zombies!

19:38.833 --> 19:44.100
Come out and play-ayyyy!

19:44.100 --> 19:45.933
Sal: Oh, get the
out of here!

19:45.933 --> 19:48.633
-Oh, no!
-Oh, my God!

19:48.633 --> 19:50.800
Sal, there's
too many of them!

19:54.833 --> 19:57.833
Unlock the cage, buddy!

19:57.833 --> 19:59.700
I  hate this.

19:59.700 --> 20:04.933
**

20:04.933 --> 20:06.200
Stay there.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.467
We got to push the cage.

20:11.467 --> 20:14.367
Come on! Stay with me!
I'll protect you!

20:14.367 --> 20:16.867
Finally he thinks about
his nieces and them being safe.

20:16.867 --> 20:20.000
Murr:
Come on! Go, Sal! Go!

20:20.000 --> 20:24.300
-Ohhh!
-You're almost there, Sal!

20:24.300 --> 20:26.433
Sal: We got to push it
up against the wall!

20:26.433 --> 20:29.133
There you go!
You're almost here, bud!

20:29.133 --> 20:31.500
Go, go!
Get out of here! Go!

20:31.500 --> 20:34.400
Screw you, zombies!

20:36.567 --> 20:38.600
Oh  you!
You're infected!

20:40.967 --> 20:44.167
-Hey!
-Hey!

20:44.167 --> 20:45.167
-Come on up.
-Don't worry.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.367
The girls are safe.

20:47.367 --> 20:49.200
-There you go.
-You survived!

20:49.200 --> 20:52.800
-Yeah, Sal!
-There you go, buddy.

20:55.267 --> 20:59.200
I saw the whole thing.
I'm so disappointed.

20:59.200 --> 21:00.933
You ever wish
you had a son?

21:00.933 --> 21:02.067
Yes.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.800
Well, this is humiliating.

21:07.900 --> 21:11.500
**

21:11.500 --> 21:12.733
Welcome to Impractical Insider.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.767
You just saw Sal
get punished in this sewer.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.067
And now you get a behind-the-
scenes look of how it happened,

21:17.067 --> 21:18.967
and bonus footage
from tonight's episode.

21:18.967 --> 21:20.367
Should I do one
without the mask?

21:20.367 --> 21:21.667
No? Great.

21:21.667 --> 21:24.300
This is -- the raw meat
is being mixed into this

21:24.300 --> 21:25.967
so it looks more pbht.

21:25.967 --> 21:29.200
Wow. We've never done something
like this on "Jokers."

21:29.200 --> 21:30.567
Is this part of the body?

21:30.567 --> 21:31.733
Oh, cool. I see some ears

21:31.733 --> 21:33.200
or something forming in there.

21:33.200 --> 21:34.767
This is gonna be for the...

21:34.767 --> 21:35.633
Torso?

21:35.633 --> 21:38.633
The meat trap I guess,

21:38.633 --> 21:39.700
for the zombies.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.767
Yeah.
I like seeing steam and blood.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.767
So, how you feeling
right now, buddy?

21:43.767 --> 21:46.100
I'm feeling awesome.
Zombified.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.267
Do you want to do this

21:47.267 --> 21:49.100
or like, is this
just part of your job?

21:49.100 --> 21:51.767
Oh, no, no. This is, like,
early Christmas for me

21:51.767 --> 21:53.700
because Halloween
is my Christmas.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.133
You got the full disease?

21:55.133 --> 21:57.767
Yeah. I'm gonna eat people.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.800
Sal: I  hate this!

21:59.800 --> 22:03.733
You have live maggots
on your face.

22:03.733 --> 22:04.800
Yes, I do.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.667
-Them are worms!

22:07.667 --> 22:12.133
Uh-huh. My auntie got
them from the store.

22:12.133 --> 22:12.933
Okay.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.200
This is only
the beginning.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.300
It's gonna be
dripping and oozing.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.400
Wow.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.467
How did you guys
get in touch with

22:17.467 --> 22:18.633
the "Impractical Jokers"
team?

22:18.633 --> 22:20.600
We run the New York City
Zombie Crawl.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.133
So we've been
doing the zombie crawls,

22:22.133 --> 22:23.533
zombie events
in the New York area,

22:23.533 --> 22:25.600
and around the world,
for the last 11 years.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.267
But wait. Tell us.

22:27.267 --> 22:29.733
Who has this guy been, for
people at home who don't know.

22:29.733 --> 22:30.967
Cowabunga, dude.

22:33.767 --> 22:34.933
-This is Rob Emmer.
-Uh-huh.

22:34.933 --> 22:38.167
He was the first hire
on "Impractical Jokers."

22:38.167 --> 22:40.367
-All so long ago.
-So long ago.

22:40.367 --> 22:42.733
But on our show,
he has played Fat Crow.

22:45.067 --> 22:46.633
-He was in the Jell-O pool.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.600
-The Jell-O pool.
-Jell-O pool.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.100
Karate Tortoise,
if you need him.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.800
That's right.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.067
Love you, buddy.
Thanks for being a part of it.

22:55.067 --> 22:56.700
Thank you.
Always happy to be here.

22:56.700 --> 22:57.867
Are you still single?

22:57.867 --> 22:59.067
Sadly, yes.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.400
Ladies, hit him up.
Rob Emmer. Ready to go.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.267
Right? He'll get
in your Jell-O pool.

23:03.267 --> 23:06.367
-Yeah! That's right!
-That is awesome.

23:06.367 --> 23:07.567
Yes! Happy day!

23:07.567 --> 23:09.367
We are here
for Sal's punishment!

23:09.367 --> 23:12.200
The last time I followed a rope,
it was in the corn maze.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.900
I don't do --- aaah!

23:16.067 --> 23:18.833
Guys, I can't believe
we're doing another scare.

23:18.833 --> 23:20.800
Joe: Why are you making
all these assumptions?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.800
'Cause this is clearly a haunt!

23:23.800 --> 23:25.867
How is this available for us?

23:25.867 --> 23:27.967
That's the least
of your problems.

23:27.967 --> 23:29.700
This is very unsanitary.

23:29.700 --> 23:31.933
What did you just
get scared of?

23:31.933 --> 23:34.133
Everything.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.733
Wait, those are
my  nieces...

23:35.733 --> 23:39.700
Oh, my God.

23:39.700 --> 23:42.467
Murr: Sal's nieces!
In the cage!

23:42.467 --> 23:44.500
-Oh, my God.
-Sal...

23:48.200 --> 23:50.167
Is that true

23:50.167 --> 23:51.933
Is this "Saw"?

23:51.933 --> 23:55.933
We all appreciate how willing
your family is to embarrass Sal.

23:55.933 --> 23:58.233
Aw, I love it.

23:58.233 --> 23:59.833
You ever wish
you had a son?

23:59.833 --> 24:01.533
Yes.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.400
We have a couple tricks
up our sleeve.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.200
You're gonna need them.

24:12.533 --> 24:13.467
So one dip.

24:13.467 --> 24:14.533
One dip...

24:14.533 --> 24:16.900
It's one dip!

24:16.900 --> 24:19.267
Yeah, but I'm dipping
10 fries right here.

24:19.267 --> 24:21.633
It's the dip,
not the amount of fries.

24:21.633 --> 24:26.533
Guys are already
up two dips.

24:26.533 --> 24:28.600
You don't want to give me
this as 10 dips?

24:28.600 --> 24:30.167
No. Why would I?
It's one dip.

24:30.167 --> 24:31.900
I took the time to
rubber-band these fries.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.333
I took the time
to have a baby.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.067
Doesn't mean
I'm a good father.

24:35.067 --> 24:36.100
Touché.
