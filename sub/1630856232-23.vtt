15:13.780 --> 15:18.651
SO CRAZY TO HAVE ALL THESE
PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT ME.

15:18.651 --> 15:21.788
>> HEY, BIAS.
IT'S YOUR FRIENDS AND WE'RE SO

15:21.788 --> 15:23.323
EXCITED TO SEE YOU ON "THE
VOICE."

15:23.323 --> 15:25.125
WE'RE SO PROUD OF YOU FOR MAKING
IT THIS FAR.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.793
GOOD LUCK.
>> THIS WHOLE WEEK IS FAN WEEK.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.661
>> YEAH.
>> AND THEY HAVE REQUESTED THIS

15:28.661 --> 15:30.830
SONG, WHICH I THINK IS A PERFECT
SONG FOR YOU.

15:30.830 --> 15:35.735
>> YEAH, THIS SONG JUST MEANS AN
AWFUL LOT TO ME, AND I WANT TO

15:35.735 --> 15:41.141
DEDICATE IT TO MY WIFE.
* I SET OUT ON A NARROW WAY MANY

15:41.141 --> 15:43.543
YEARS AGO *
>> I THINK EVERYBODY HAS TO COME

15:43.543 --> 15:47.681
TO A BROKEN ROAD IN THEIR LIFE.
MY BROKEN ROAD WAS PROBABLY

15:47.681 --> 15:49.949
BEING IN NASHVILLE AND NOT
KNOWING WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO

15:49.949 --> 15:52.752
WITH MY LIFE.
THEN HERE COMES MY WIFE.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.388
SHE'S THE WHOLE REASON I
AUDITIONED FOR THE SHOW.

15:55.388 --> 15:59.926
SHE'S BEEN THE PERSON THAT'S
BEEN THE ROCK, AND ALLOWED ME TO

15:59.926 --> 16:03.797
CHASE THIS DREAM.
IT'S REALLY AWESOME.

16:03.797 --> 16:10.270
DO WE HAVE A TISSUE ANYWHERE?
ANYBODY?

16:10.270 --> 16:14.874
* EVERY LONG LOST DREAM *
>> WHY IS IT THE LAST MAN

16:14.874 --> 16:17.711
STANDING ON TEAM GWEN.
HE IS DEFINITELY SOMEONE THAT

16:17.711 --> 16:21.614
CAN HAVE A CAREER IN COUNTRY.
HE STRADDLES A LITTLE BIT OF A

16:21.614 --> 16:25.051
SOULFUL PLACE.
HE HAS A ROCK SIDE TO HIM.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.519
I THINK THAT'S GREAT THESE DAYS.
EVERYBODY LISTENS TO EVERYTHING,

16:26.519 --> 16:28.321
AND HE DOES A LITTLE BIT OF
EVERYTHING.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.256
WHEN YOU CAME IN, IT FELT LIKE
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BIT

16:30.256 --> 16:32.559
MORE TENDER.
YOU DON'T SEE YOURSELF LIKE

16:32.559 --> 16:35.295
THIS, BUT WE SEE YOU AS A LITTLE
BIT OF A CHARACTER, WHICH IS WHY

16:35.295 --> 16:36.596
PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ATTACH TO
YOU, I THINK.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.265
>> HECK YEAH.
>> THEY WANT MORE OF YOU.

16:39.265 --> 16:42.769
STRATEGICALLY, TO BE ABLE TO DO
A SONG LIKE THIS WHERE IT'S LIKE

16:42.769 --> 16:46.706
STRIP IT ALL AWAY, WE WANT
PEOPLE TO KNOW GET ATTACHED TO A

16:46.706 --> 16:49.175
TRUE ARTIST.
>> THE BIGGEST THING GWEN HAS

16:49.175 --> 16:50.844
TAUGHT ME IS TO STAY TRUE TO
MYSELF.

16:50.844 --> 16:53.413
LET MY CHARACTER SHINE THROUGH
IN MY MUSIC, AND I THINK THAT'S

16:53.413 --> 16:59.652
THE THING THAT WILL TAKE ME TO
WHERE I WANT TO GO IN THIS

16:59.652 --> 17:02.789
INDUSTRY.
GOOD LUCK, CECCHOACH.

17:02.789 --> 17:06.526
YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE FOR ME?
>> I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.662
>> Carson: SINCE IT IS FAN WEEK,
SOME OF BIAS'S BIGGEST

17:09.662 --> 17:12.866
SUPPORTERS ARE THE VIEWING PARTY
IN GEORGIA AND ARE JOINING US TO

17:12.866 --> 17:13.867
INTRODUCE THIS PERFORMANCE
TONIGHT.

17:13.867 --> 17:18.405
TAKE A LOOK.
>> I'M PASTOR TERRY.

17:18.405 --> 17:43.163
BIAS IS OBVIOUSLY OUR FAVORITE
BECAUSE OF HIS

17:43.163 --> 17:47.400
* I SET OUT ON A NARROW WAY
MANY YEARS AGO *

17:47.400 --> 17:54.274
* HOPING I WOULD FIND
TRUE LOVE *

17:54.274 --> 17:58.111
* ALONG THE BROKEN ROAD
I GOT LOST A TIME OR TWO *

17:58.111 --> 18:02.716
* WIPED MY BROW AND
KEPT PUSHING THROUGH *

18:02.716 --> 18:09.589
* I COULDN'T SEE
HOW EVERY SIGN

18:09.589 --> 18:15.929
POINTED STRAIGHT TO YOU *
* EVERY LONG LOST DREAM

18:15.929 --> 18:20.133
LED ME TO WHERE YOU ARE *
* OTHERS WHO BROKE MY HEART

18:20.133 --> 18:27.040
THEY WERE LIKE
NORTHERN STARS *

18:27.040 --> 18:31.778
* POINTING ME ON MY WAY
INTO YOUR LOVING ARMS *

18:31.778 --> 18:36.516
* OH THIS MUCH
I KNOW IS TRUE *

18:36.516 --> 18:39.652
* THAT GOD BLESSED
THE BROKEN ROAD *

18:39.652 --> 18:45.692
* THAT LED ME
STRAIGHT TO YOU *

18:47.894 --> 18:52.098
*
* I THINK ABOUT

18:52.098 --> 18:57.404
THE YEARS I SPENT
JUST PASSING THROUGH *

18:57.404 --> 19:02.175
* I'D LIKE TO FIND
THE TIME I LOST

19:02.175 --> 19:05.345
AND GIVE IT BACK TO YOU *
* YOU JUST SMILE

19:05.345 --> 19:09.582
AND TAKE MY HAND *
* YOU'VE BEEN THERE

19:09.582 --> 19:13.253
YOU UNDERSTAND *
* IT'S ALL PART OF

19:13.253 --> 19:19.626
A GRANDER PLAN
THAT IS COMING TRUE *

19:19.626 --> 19:24.898
* EVERY LONG LOST DREAM
LED ME TO WHERE YOU ARE *

19:24.898 --> 19:32.806
* OTHERS WHO BROKE MY HEART
THEY WERE LIKE

19:32.806 --> 19:36.509
NORTHERN STARS *
* POINTING ME ON MY WAY

19:36.509 --> 19:42.849
INTO YOUR LOVING ARMS *
* OH THIS MUCH

19:42.849 --> 19:46.052
I KNOW IS TRUE *
* THAT GOD BLESSED

19:46.052 --> 19:52.392
THE BROKEN ROAD *
* THAT LED ME

19:52.392 --> 19:59.766
STRAIGHT TO YOU *
* NOW I'M JUST ROLLING HOME *

19:59.766 --> 20:05.572
* INTO YOUR LOVING ARMS
THIS MUCH I KNOW IS TRUE.

20:05.572 --> 20:17.183
THAT GOD BLESSED
THE BROKEN ROAD *

20:17.183 --> 20:32.899
* THAT LED ME STRAIGHT
TO YOU *

20:32.899 --> 20:35.902
>> THANK YOU.
>> Carson: "COUNTRY ROADS," NOW

20:35.902 --> 20:38.638
BROKEN ROADS.
I'M SENSING A THEME.

20:38.638 --> 20:47.480
THAT IS BIAS, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, LIVE ON "THE VOICE,"

20:47.480 --> 20:50.250
SINGING TO YOUR VOTE.
NICE WORK, BIAS.

20:50.250 --> 20:54.721
NIALL, LET'S GET SOME THOUGHTS
FROM YOU.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.323
>> YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF A FAN
I AM OF YOU, BIAS.

20:57.323 --> 20:59.125
I THINK THAT WAS YOUR MOST
MATURE PERFORMANCE OF THE WHOLE

20:59.125 --> 21:01.061
SEASON.
I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY WELL

21:01.061 --> 21:03.596
EXECUTED AND BEAUTIFUL, AND YOU
CAN TELL THE FANS DEFINITELY

21:03.596 --> 21:05.098
PICKED THE RIGHT SONG FOR YOU
THIS WEEK.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.234
IT FELT REALLY EMOTIONAL.
YOUR LEVELS OF CONSISTENCY ARE

21:08.234 --> 21:11.071
JUST THROUGH THE ROOF.
EVERY TIME YOU COME OUT HERE,

21:11.071 --> 21:15.575
WHETHER WE SEE THIS SIDE OF YOU
OR THE ROCKIER SIDE WE SEEN LAST

21:15.575 --> 21:18.678
WEEK, THEY'RE ALL ON FIRE.
THEY'RE ALL IMPRESSIVE.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.513
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.817
>> Carson: BIAS, YOUR COACH,
GWEN.

21:23.817 --> 21:27.787
>> I AGREE.
VERY WELL SAID.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.691
I'M JUST SO EXCITED THAT YOU'RE
ON MY TEAM AND THAT I GOT TO GET

21:31.691 --> 21:33.793
TO KNOW YOU AS AN ARTIST.
YOU'RE VERY -- I SAID THIS

21:33.793 --> 21:36.096
BEFORE.
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING VERY

21:36.096 --> 21:39.165
AUTHENTIC AND REAL ABOUT HIM,
AND YOU KIND OF DON'T BELIEVE IT

21:39.165 --> 21:42.135
AT FIRST BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A
CHARACTER, BUT THAT'S WHO HE IS,

21:42.135 --> 21:45.271
AND IT'S JUST BEAUTIFUL TO GET
TO KNOW YOU.

21:45.271 --> 21:48.541
YOUR VOICE IS SO GORGEOUS.
AND YOU HAVE SUCH GREAT STAGE

21:48.541 --> 21:51.244
PRESENCE, AND I KNOW AMERICA
LOVES YOU ALREADY, SO

21:51.244 --> 21:53.246
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:53.246 --> 21:53.546
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Jimmy:

21:56.116 --> 21:59.753
>> Carson: IF YOU WANT BIAS IN
THE FINALE, YOU CAN VOTE ON

21:59.753 --> 22:03.123
NBC.COM AND "THE VOICE" OFFICIAL
APP.

22:03.123 --> 22:10.964
GIVE IT UP AGAIN FOR BIAS.
WHEN WE COME BACK, JACQUIE PUTS

22:10.964 --> 22:13.667
HER POWERFUL TWIST ON A SONG BY
SIA AND THEN THE SONG YOU

22:28.448 --> 22:30.750
LIVE FAN WEEK SEMIFINALS.
NOW IT'S TEAM REBA'S COUNTRY

22:30.750 --> 22:34.087
SINGER FROM OREGON.
TONIGHT, SHE'S TACKLING A

22:34.087 --> 22:35.989
POWERFUL SONG WITH AN
INSPIRATIONAL MESSAGE THAT SHE'S

22:35.989 --> 22:43.196
TAKING TO HEART.
HERE'S MORE FROM JACQUIE ROAR.

22:43.196 --> 22:45.331
>> I MADE IT TO TOP NINE, AND
CRAZY IS THAT THIS IS HAPPENING

22:45.331 --> 22:49.636
NOW.
I MEAN, PEOPLE ARE SENDING ME

22:49.636 --> 22:53.473
VIDEOS.
FANS OF MINE PUT UP BILLBOARDS

22:53.473 --> 22:56.309
ALL OVER OREGON.
IT FEELS INCREDIBLE.

22:56.309 --> 23:00.413
BUT IT DOESN'T HIT ME QUITE AS
HARD AS WHEN MY TWO GIRLS ARE

23:00.413 --> 23:01.381
SAYING, MOM, I'M SO PROUD OF
YOU.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.950
I MISS YOU BOTH.
>> I HOPE YOU MAKE IT TO THE

23:03.950 --> 23:06.820
FINALS.
I LOVE YOU, MAMA.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.289
>> THANK YOU, HONEY.
HOPEFULLY, WITH SOME REBA

23:09.289 --> 23:11.091
GUIDANCE.
>> I'M SO PROUD, I CAN'T HARDLY

23:11.091 --> 23:16.196
STAND IT.
>> I GET TO THE TOP FIVE.

23:16.196 --> 23:18.231
>> SO, TODAY IS FAN-SUGGESTED
SONG.

23:18.231 --> 23:20.300
>> I'M ACTUALLY KIND OF SHOCKED
THAT THEY WENT OUTSIDE OF

23:20.300 --> 23:26.072
COUNTRY MUSIC.
THEY CHOSE SIA, BUT I DID FIND A

23:26.072 --> 23:29.075
VERSION THAT FITS ME.
CHRIS DAUGHERTY'S VERSION.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.276
THEY'RE, LIKE, HEY, WE LOVE IT
WHEN YOU BELT.

23:30.276 --> 23:33.079
CAN YOU JUST BELT THE WHOLE
SONG?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.881
>> LET'S HEAR YOU SING IT.
I CAN'T WAIT.

23:34.881 --> 23:40.487
* I'M STILL FREEZING *
>> I CONNECT WITH THIS SONG,

23:40.487 --> 23:46.092
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE, I'M ALIVE.
I WENT THROUGH SO MUCH IN THE

23:46.092 --> 23:47.927
MUSIC INDUSTRY, AND I CAN'T
THANK AMERICA ENOUGH, BECAUSE

23:47.927 --> 23:52.966
THEY GAVE ME SO MUCH CONFIDENCE,
AND I HAVE TO REMIND MYSELF THAT

23:52.966 --> 23:56.102
I AM WORTHY.
IT'S NOT JUST THE FIGHT OF BEING

23:56.102 --> 24:02.242
IN THIS INDUSTRY.
IT'S THE FIGHT WITH MY BRAIN TO

24:02.242 --> 24:02.842
IT'S THE FIGHT WITH MY BRAIN TO
BELIEVE THAT I DESERVE THIS.

24:09.049 --> 24:20.660
>> EXCELLENT.
EXCELLENT.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.461
EXCELLENT.
>> THANK YOU.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.862
>> THE ONLY THINGS I CAN TELL
YOU, WHEN YOU START THE SONG,

24:22.862 --> 24:23.496
PLANT.
>> OKAY.

24:23.496 --> 24:24.898
>> YOU'RE TELLING THE STORY.
SO, REALLY GET INTO THAT FRAME

24:24.898 --> 24:25.932
OF MIND, AND THEN PLANT THIS.
>> OKAY.

24:25.932 --> 24:28.468
>> LIKE A STRONG WOMAN INSTEAD
OF, YOU KNOW, ALL --

24:28.468 --> 24:29.636
>> YEAH, STANDING STILL IS THE
HARDEST PART.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.705
>> IT IS.
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

24:31.705 --> 24:33.440
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.
>> YES.

24:33.440 --> 24:37.911
YOU GET ME.
>> THE GREAT THING ABOUT JACQUIE

24:37.911 --> 24:41.147
IS SHE CAN SING ANYTHING, AND
THIS IS TOTALLY OUT OF HER

24:41.147 --> 24:43.350
WHEELHOUSE, BUT SHE MADE IT HER
OWN.

24:43.350 --> 24:45.618
SHE'S A STAR.
AND SHE CAN WIN.

24:45.618 --> 24:55.161
I GOT A GOOD TEAM, I GOT A GOOD
TEAM, YES, I DO.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.263
>> Carson: LET'S GO OVER TO SOME
OF JACQUIE'S FANS WHO ARE

CHARLIE CARR, AND THESE ARE SOME
OF THE OREGON FRIENDS AND FANS

25:11.544 --> 25:14.547
OF JACQUIE ROAR.
JACQUIE'S NOT JUST OUR FAVORITE

25:14.547 --> 25:18.151
ARTIST ON SEASON 24 OF "THE
VOICE" BECAUSE SHE HAS AN

25:18.151 --> 25:23.390
AMAZING RANGE AND A TOTAL
COMMAND OF THE STAGE, BUT

25:23.390 --> 25:27.093
BECAUSE SHE'S AN AMAZING PERSON,
AND ACCEPTS EVERYONE AND ALWAYS

25:27.093 --> 25:31.664
SHOWS UP FOR HER FRIENDS.
HERE TO SING YOUR FAN-PICKED

25:31.664 --> 25:33.833
SONG, PLEASE WELCOME MS. JACQUIE
ROAR.

25:43.777 --> 25:48.448
*
* I WAS BORN

25:48.448 --> 25:55.321
IN A THUNDERSTORM
I GREW UP OVERNIGHT *

25:55.321 --> 26:02.696
* I PLAYED ALONE
I PLAYED ON MY OWN

26:02.696 --> 26:08.535
BUT I SURVIVED *
* HEY, I WANTED EVERYTHING

26:08.535 --> 26:12.205
I NEVER HAD *
* LIKE THE LOVE THAT

26:12.205 --> 26:15.375
COMES WITH LIGHT *
* I WORE ENVY

26:15.375 --> 26:21.715
AND I HATED THAT
BUT I SURVIVED *

26:21.715 --> 26:24.884
* I HAD A ONE-WAY
TICKET TO A PLACE

26:24.884 --> 26:28.054
WHERE ALL THE DEMONS GO *
* WHERE THE WIND

26:28.054 --> 26:31.391
DON'T CHANGE AND NOTHING IN
THE GROUND CAN EVER GROW *

26:31.391 --> 26:34.394
* NO HOPE, JUST LIES
AND YOU'RE TAUGHT TO CRY *

26:34.394 --> 26:41.801
* IN YOUR PILLOW
BUT I SURVIVED *

26:41.801 --> 26:47.607
* I'M STILL BREATHING
I'M STILL BREATHING *

26:47.607 --> 26:53.947
* I'M STILL BREATHING
I'M STILL BREATHING *

26:53.947 --> 27:03.456
* I'M ALIVE
I'M ALIVE *

27:03.456 --> 27:10.864
* I'M ALIVE
I'M ALIVE *

27:10.864 --> 27:12.032
* I HAD MADE EVERY
SINGLE MISTAKE *

27:12.032 --> 27:14.034
* THAT YOU COULD EVER
POSSIBLY MAKE *

27:14.034 --> 27:17.704

AND I TOOK WHAT YOU GAVE *

27:17.704 --> 27:19.839
* BUT YOU NEVER NOTICED
THAT I WAS IN PAIN *

27:19.839 --> 27:21.941
* I KNEW WHAT I WANTED
I WENT IN AND GOT IT *

27:21.941 --> 27:25.111
* DID ALL THE THINGS THAT
YOU SAID THAT I WOULDN'T *

27:25.111 --> 27:32.485

NEVER BE FORGOTTEN *

27:32.485 --> 27:42.829

[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>> Carson: NOT AN EASY TASK.

28:34.114 --> 28:38.852
THE FANS PUTTING JACQUIE UP TO
SINGING SIA, BUT SHE KNOCKS IT

28:38.852 --> 28:44.457
OUT OF THE PARK.
GREAT JOB, JACQUIE.

28:44.457 --> 28:48.628
I MEAN, USUALLY, WE ALL PANIC
WHEN SOMEONE SINGS SIA ON THIS

28:48.628 --> 28:49.629
PROGRAM IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR
FORM.

28:49.629 --> 28:52.632
IT'S THAT DIFFICULT.
BUT YOU NAILED IT.

28:52.632 --> 28:54.501
REALLY INCREDIBLE.
JOHN, YOU CAN SPEAK SOME MORE TO

28:54.501 --> 28:56.469
THAT.
>> I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY,

28:56.469 --> 29:00.006
LIKE, THIS WAS SUCH A
CHALLENGING SONG TO SING, AND

29:00.006 --> 29:05.245
SIA IS SUCH A TALENTED
SONGWRITER AND ARTIST, AND SOME

29:05.245 --> 29:08.348
OF HER SONGS ARE REALLY
CHALLENGING, AND SO THAT'S WHY

29:08.348 --> 29:11.584
WE SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO SING IT ON

29:11.584 --> 29:13.019
THIS SHOW, BUT WOW, YOU KNOCKED
IT OUT OF THE PARK.

29:13.019 --> 29:19.459
THE LOW PART OF YOUR VOICE WAS
SO BEAUTIFUL AND POWERFUL.

29:19.459 --> 29:23.863
AND IT WAS STUNNING JUST TO SEE
YOUR RANGE ON DISPLAY.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.599
IT WAS AMAZING.
>> Carson: REBA?

29:26.599 --> 29:28.134
>> JACQUIE, I KNOW YOUR KIDS ARE
SO PROUD OF YOU.

29:28.134 --> 29:31.838
I AM.
YOU'RE THE COMPLETE PACKAGE.

29:31.838 --> 29:35.408
FOR YOU TO WALK DOWN THOSE
STAIRS IN HIGH HEEL BOOTS WITH

29:35.408 --> 29:39.546
SMOKE, SINGING THAT TOUGH OF A
SONG, THAT'S HARD TO DO.

29:39.546 --> 30:01.968
I WAS FEELING IT FOR YOU.

>> I JUST WANT TO MAKE MY FANS

44:02.108 --> 44:04.611
PROUD.
IT'S CRAZY SAYING THAT.

44:04.611 --> 44:05.578
I'M TRYING TO MAKE MY FANS
PROUD.

44:05.578 --> 44:10.517
THAT'S INSANE.
IT'S NOT JUST MY MOM.

44:10.517 --> 44:13.787
>> THANKS TO THE FANS FOR
PICKING A BANGER.

44:13.787 --> 44:16.956
"WAY DOWN WE GO."
IT'S A WELL-ROUNDED SONG FOR

44:16.956 --> 44:19.693
THIS POINT IN THE COMPETITION
WHERE PEOPLE GO, OH, HE CAN ALSO

44:19.693 --> 44:23.296
DO THAT, AND THEN HOPEFULLY
PEOPLE GO, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE.

44:23.296 --> 44:26.466
THIS SONG IS HUNTLEY
PERSONIFIED.

44:26.466 --> 44:30.503
* OH, FATHER TELL ME *
>> IT'S ALSO GOING TO SHOW A

44:30.503 --> 44:33.940
SIDE OF HUNTLEY WE HAVEN'T SEEN
YET, TAKING HIM AWAY FROM THE

44:33.940 --> 44:38.278
SOUTHERN ROCK AND CONTEMPORARY
THAT IS STILL GIVING US HUNTLEY.

44:38.278 --> 44:39.245
HE'S GOING TO THE FINALE,
SURELY.

44:39.245 --> 44:43.083
* WAY DOWN WE GO *
>> THIS SONG IS ABOUT FIGHTING

44:43.083 --> 44:44.984
THROUGH STRUGGLE AND PAIN AND
FINDING REDEMPTION.

44:44.984 --> 44:47.787
I'VE ALWAYS JUST HAD TO FIGHT
FOR EVERYTHING.

44:47.787 --> 44:49.656
I MOVED TO NASHVILLE WHEN I WAS
19.

44:49.656 --> 44:51.925
I DIDN'T HAVE A DOLLAR TO MY
NAME, AND I WAS ACTUALLY

44:51.925 --> 44:55.261
HOMELESS FOR A MONTH AND A HALF,
AND I KEPT ON TRYING TO GET MY

44:55.261 --> 44:58.231
FOOT IN THE DOOR IN PLACES, AND
IT JUST KEPT GETTING SLAMMED.

44:58.231 --> 45:02.702
I LEFT NASHVILLE, AND I CAME
HOME BROKEN, BUT AFTER ALL THAT

45:02.702 --> 45:07.307
FAILURE, IF I COULD TELL THAT
19-YEAR-OLD KID ANYTHING, I

45:07.307 --> 45:11.044
WOULD TELL HIM TO GO SLEEP ON
THAT PARK BENCH, THAT IT'S WORTH

45:11.044 --> 45:14.881
IT.
FROM A PARK BENCH TO TOP NINE OF

45:14.881 --> 45:19.119
"THE VOICE."
>> THIS IS A MAPPING ONE.

45:19.119 --> 45:20.487
SING THAT FIRST CHORUS LIKE THE
ORIGINAL.

45:20.487 --> 45:44.644
* WAY DOWN WE GO *
>> AFTER THAT HOOSIER AND

45:44.644 --> 45:46.646
COCKER.
>> I HAVE NO DOUBT HUNTLEY

45:46.646 --> 45:51.317
SHOULD BE IN THE FINALE, AND
WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHY RIGHT

45:51.317 --> 46:00.827
AFTER THIS.
* OH, FATHER TELL ME

46:00.827 --> 46:12.439
DO WE GET WHAT WE DESERVE
OH, WE GET WHAT WE DESERVE *

46:12.439 --> 46:16.142

DESCRIBED YOURSELF AS JOE COCKER

49:08.114 --> 49:12.185

BEAUTIFULLY.
I REALLY SEE WHERE YOU WANT TO

THANK YOU, AMERICA.

50:59.559 --> 51:04.631
LET'S DO IT AGAIN.
JERSEY HAS BEEN GOING WILD.

51:04.631 --> 51:08.902
MY LOCAL PIZZERIA LITERALLY MADE
A MENU AROUND ME.

51:08.902 --> 51:11.571
MY OLD HIGH SCHOOL JUST THREW A
HUGE PEP RALLY FOR ME.

51:11.571 --> 51:18.078
TO KNOW THAT I HAVE THAT KIND OF
SUPPORT, IT MAKES ME WANT TO

51:18.078 --> 51:20.714
WORK EVEN HARTER FDER FOR THIS.
>> IT'S THE SEMIFINALS.

51:20.714 --> 51:22.148
>> WHAT THE HECK?

51:22.148 --> 51:24.718
THE FANS HAVE
SUGGESTED "PARACHUTE" BY CHRIS

51:24.718 --> 51:27.087
STAPLETON.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A NEW SIDE OF

51:27.087 --> 51:31.391
MARA WE'RE GOING TO SEE.
CHRIS STAPLETON IS ONE OF THE

51:31.391 --> 51:32.659
MOST SOULFUL SINGERS ON THE
PLANET.

51:32.659 --> 51:38.098
MARA IS THE MOST SOULFUL SINGER
IN THE COMPETITION.

51:38.098 --> 51:42.369
WATCHING HER EVOLVE INTO THE
ARTIST THAT SHE IS BECOMING IS

51:42.369 --> 51:43.436
PRETTY SPECIAL.
WOW.

51:43.436 --> 51:47.374
THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
THE FANS DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB,

51:47.374 --> 51:52.012
BECAUSE I LOVE THIS SONG.
BIGGEST CHANCE FOR YOU TO SING

51:52.012 --> 51:53.113
AS DYNAMIC AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN.
>> YEAH.

51:53.113 --> 51:57.117
>> THAT WAS 100 MILES AN HOUR.
YOU NEED TO SHOW SMALLER AND

51:57.117 --> 51:59.152
LARGER PARTS OF YOUR VOICE.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT STORY

51:59.152 --> 52:00.587
ACROSS BEFORE YOU DO ANY
BELTING.

52:00.587 --> 52:04.290
THE ONLY WAY TO TELL THE STORY
IS IN CONVERSATIONAL SINGING.

52:04.290 --> 52:07.894
YOU HAVE A WAY OF, LIKE,
CONNECTING WITH THE LYRIC.

52:07.894 --> 52:10.597
I THINK THAT'S WHAT MAKES CHRIS
SO GOOD.

52:10.597 --> 52:13.633
>> I DO HAVE A WAY OF CONNECTING
WITH IT.

52:13.633 --> 52:16.302
A PARACHUTE IS A SAFETY NET,
KIND OF.

52:16.302 --> 52:20.840
I THOUGHT OF MY MOTHER.
SHE'S BEEN GOING THROUGH A LOT.

52:20.840 --> 52:25.478
SHE JUST HAD DOUBLE MASTECTOMY
SURGERY, AND THAT WOMAN IS MY

52:25.478 --> 52:28.915
BIGGEST SUPPORTER.
SHE HAS BEEN RECOVERING, BUT IT

52:28.915 --> 52:35.855
HAS NOT BEEN EASY.
I HAVE SEEN HER FIGHT.

52:35.855 --> 52:41.761
IT MAKES ME WANT TO FIGHT EVEN
HARDER.

52:41.761 --> 52:45.699
KNOWING THAT SHE BELIEVES IN ME
AND THAT SHE'S SO PROUD OF ME.

52:45.699 --> 52:48.802
I ALSO THOUGHT OF YOU.
YOU ARE MY PARACHUTE.

52:48.802 --> 52:51.838
>> YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE ME CRY.
AMERICA'S FALLEN IN LOVE WITH

52:51.838 --> 52:56.976
MARA BECAUSE SHE HAS AN AMAZING
VOICE, NO DOUBT, BUT PEOPLE LOVE

52:56.976 --> 53:02.148
TO SEE GOOD PEOPLE DO GOOD
THINGS, AND MARA IS THAT IN A

53:02.148 --> 53:03.883
NUTSHELL.

YOU.
I'M A CLOSET SWIFTY MYSELF.

58:55.368 --> 58:57.837
>> I WOULDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF A
SWIFTY RIGHT NOW, BUT MAYBE

58:57.837 --> 59:00.140
AFTER THIS SONG, I'LL BE A
LITTLE SWIFTY.

59:00.140 --> 59:05.211
>> THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SONGS
TAYLOR UTILIZES THE BANJO.

59:05.211 --> 59:07.447
EARLY IN HER CAREER, SHE USED A
LOT OF BANJO.

59:07.447 --> 59:13.753
>>IC IT, GIRL.

EVER GONNA BE IS MEAN *

01:00:30.397 --> 01:00:31.965
* WHY YOU GOTTA

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:33.566
* YOU WITH YOUR
SWITCHING SIDES *

01:00:33.566 --> 01:00:38.438
* AND YOUR WILDFIRE LIES
AND YOUR HUMILIATION *

01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:39.906

RUBY, EVERYBODY.
WHEN WE COME BACK, MAC DEDICATES

01:02:35.989 --> 01:02:39.859
A HUGE R&B SONG TO HIS FRIENDS,
AND THEN NINI AND LILA RETURN TO

01:02:39.859 --> 01:02:40.994
AND THEN NINI AND LILA RETURN TO
THE STAGE WITH THE SONGS THAT

01:02:50.437 --> 01:02:54.140
>> Carson: WELCOME BACK TO THE
LIVE SEMI-FINALS.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.546
CONTINUING NOW WITH TEAM
LEGEND'S R&B SINGER FROM

01:02:59.546 --> 01:03:02.515
ARKANSAS WHO'S MAKING A BIG
IMPACT ON HIS NEW FANS.

01:03:02.515 --> 01:03:05.051
HERE'S MORE FROM MAC ROYALS.
>> MAC, MAC, MAC.

01:03:05.051 --> 01:03:07.187
MAC.
ROYALTY'S IN THE BUILDING.

01:03:07.187 --> 01:03:08.421
>> GOT THE PURPLE ON, READY TO
GO.

01:03:08.421 --> 01:03:13.460
>> OH MY GOODNESS.
>> I FEEL ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:14.461
I'M IN THE TOP NINE OF "THE
VOICE."

01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:36.516
IT'S LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE.
>> IT'S FAN WEEK.

01:03:36.516 --> 01:03:38.218
I HEARD THERE'S A LOT SUCH AN
INSPIRATION.

01:03:38.218 --> 01:03:40.587
>> GROWING UP IN ARKANSAS,
THERE'S A LOT OF LOVE, BUT THERE

01:03:40.587 --> 01:03:42.722
WEREN'T MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR
AN ARTIST.

01:03:42.722 --> 01:03:47.460
THE YOUNGER VERSION OF MYSELF
WOULD PROBABLY CRY FROM JOY AT

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.897
WHAT IS GOING ON IN MY LIFE NOW.
SO, I STARTED A NONPROFIT.

01:03:50.897 --> 01:03:53.500
THERE ARE CHILDREN THERE
THINKING TO THEMSELVES, MAC DID

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:56.236
THAT, SO MAYBE I COULD DO IT.
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

01:03:56.236 --> 01:04:00.540
WHY I DO THIS.
* LOOKING BACK *

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.711
>> THIS SONG IS SO PERFECT FOR
MAC, BECAUSE MAC HAS THAT

01:04:04.711 --> 01:04:08.948
WHISPERY, SOULFUL VOICE, BUT HE
CAN TURN IT UP AND GET SEXY.

01:04:08.948 --> 01:04:12.052
MAC IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE
ARTISTS THAT I HAVE WORKED WITH

01:04:12.052 --> 01:04:17.323
IN ALL MY TIME ON "THE VOICE."
HE'S THE ONLY R&B VOICE LEFT,

01:04:17.323 --> 01:04:21.695
AND I KNOW THAT R&B FANS ARE SO
HAPPY HE'S REPRESENTING WHAT

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:24.064
REAL R&B SOUNDS LIKE.
I WANT TO HEAR MORE EMPHASIS,

01:04:24.064 --> 01:04:26.199
MORE DRAMA.
>> FOR SURE.

01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:30.570
>> START LIKE YOU'RE STARTING,
BE SMOOTH, PETTY, AND THEN THINK

01:04:30.570 --> 01:04:35.709
OF YOURSELF AS LIKE A BLUES MAN.
TRY TO SUMMON OTIS AND JAMES

01:04:35.709 --> 01:04:39.379
BROWN FOR A SECOND.
>> CAN WE JUST PAUSE AND TALK

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.582
ABOUT MY COACH?
>> I'M GOING TO SING SOME IDEAS.

01:04:42.582 --> 01:04:45.118
* TRY TO TAKE CONTROL OF LOVE *
>> I HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT I

01:04:45.118 --> 01:04:49.856
WANTED TO DO WHEN I WENT IN
THERE, AND JOHN WAS, LIKE, NO,

01:04:49.856 --> 01:04:53.259
NO, NO.
* LET IT GO *

01:04:53.259 --> 01:04:55.929
>> THIS MAN'S A GENIUS.
I JUST GOT SERENADED IN MY OWN

01:04:55.929 --> 01:05:02.502
PRACTICE.
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

01:05:02.502 --> 01:05:05.939
>> AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE LEGEND.
>> JOHN LEGEND LEADS BY EXAMPLE.

01:05:05.939 --> 01:05:09.342
WHATEVER THAT WAS, I'M GOING TO
GIVE THAT TO AMERICA, BECAUSE

01:05:09.342 --> 01:05:11.177
THEY NEED TO HEAR IT.
AMERICA, Y'ALL HAVE BEEN --

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:19.953

01:11:37.097 --> 01:11:41.267
>> THIS IS FAN WEEK, AND THEY
HAVE, LIKE, BEEN SENDING IN

01:11:41.267 --> 01:11:43.837
SUGGESTIONS ONLINE ABOUT WHAT
THEY THINK SHOULD BE SUNG, AND I

01:11:43.837 --> 01:11:49.909
THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
YOU TO SING SOMETHING A TOUCH

01:11:49.909 --> 01:11:51.711
MORE CONTEMPORARY BUT STILL HAVE
NINI IN IT.

01:11:51.711 --> 01:11:56.683
>> IT'S PERFECT.
>> THIS WILL BE ON YOUR RECORD.

01:11:56.683 --> 01:12:00.153
>> YES.
* THIS IS NO TIME TO DIE *

01:12:00.153 --> 01:12:04.057
>> I'M A HUGE FAN OF JAMES BOND
THEME SONGS, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

01:12:04.057 --> 01:12:07.827
THEM, AND ONE OF MY DREAMS IS TO
WRITE A THEME SONG FOR JAMES

01:12:07.827 --> 01:12:11.965
BOND, AND I'M A HUGE BILLIE FAN,
AND I HOPE I DON'T MESS THIS UP.

01:12:11.965 --> 01:12:15.669
* YOU'RE NO LONGER MY CONCERN *
>> NINI IRIS, HER ABILITY TO

01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:18.705
KNOW WHO SHE IS AS AN ARTIST IS
UNLIKE ANYONE ELSE IN THE SHOW.

01:12:18.705 --> 01:12:22.175
SHE KNOWS HOW TO SING SONGS THAT
YOU WOULD NOT NECESSARILY THINK,

01:12:22.175 --> 01:12:25.945
OH, NINI COULD SING THAT.
AND THAT IS SUCH A COOL THING TO

01:12:25.945 --> 01:12:30.950
HAVE AS AN ARTIST IN THIS SHOW
AND OUTSIDE OF THE SHOW.

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:32.118
SING THE FIRST "NO TIME TO DIE"
STRAIGHT.

01:12:32.118 --> 01:12:39.559
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT AT
THE END ONCE YOU SING SMALL

01:12:39.559 --> 01:12:40.593
FIRST.
REMEMBER, THESE PEOPLE ARE SAT

01:12:40.593 --> 01:12:41.828
AT HOME ON THEIR COUCH, AND
THEY'RE LOOKING TO BE

01:12:41.828 --> 01:12:42.962
ENTERTAINED, BUT THEY ALSO WANT
TO BE MOVED.

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:43.963
>> YEAH.
>> IF SHE CAN DELIVER THAT

01:12:43.963 --> 01:12:50.403
EMOTION AND SING SOFT AND GIVE
US NINI, I'VE NO DOUBT WE ARE

01:12:50.403 --> 01:12:54.741
GOING TO THE FINALE.
YOU ARE ONE SING AWAY FROM THE

01:12:54.741 --> 01:12:57.644
FINALE.
AND YOU DESERVE TO BE THERE.

01:12:57.644 --> 01:13:01.915
>> THANK YOU.
>> AMERICA, IT'S ME AGAIN.

01:13:01.915 --> 01:13:11.291

REPRESENTING BROOKLYN IN THE TOP
NINE LIVE ON "THE VOICE" SINGING

01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:40.266
TO MAKE IT TO THE FINALE NEXT
WEEK.

01:16:40.266 --> 01:16:42.702
COME ON DOWN, NINI.
GREAT JOB.

01:16:42.702 --> 01:16:44.771
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE.
THAT FELT LIKE A JAMES BOND

01:16:44.771 --> 01:16:46.373
OPENING SEQUENCE.
THAT WAS AMAZING.

01:16:46.373 --> 01:16:48.308

01:16:55.281 --> 01:17:00.020
I MEAN, YOUR ABILITY TO NOT ONLY
JUST SING BUT TO BE, WITH THAT

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:03.523
VOICE, BEING SO GIFTED TO DO
ANYTHING, YOU'RE SO TASTEFUL

01:17:03.523 --> 01:17:06.026
WITH THE WAY THAT YOU BUILD THE
SONGS, AND I FEEL LIKE I WAS IN

01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:09.129
AN ACTUAL FILM.
LIKE, SO MUCH HAPPENED WITHIN

01:17:09.129 --> 01:17:11.698
JUST THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.
YOU ARE SO TALENTED.

01:17:11.698 --> 01:17:13.733
WHATEVER HAPPENS, LIKE, I

THE NAME NINI IRIS.
SHE'S GOING TO BE AROUND A LONG

01:17:25.779 --> 01:17:29.616
TIME, I KNOW FOR A FACT.
YOUR ABILITY AS I KEEP SAYING TO

01:17:29.616 --> 01:17:36.089
KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS AN ARTIST IS
UNBELIEVABLE, AND TO FLIP EVERY

01:17:36.089 --> 01:17:37.524
SONG THAT YOU TAKE ON ITS HEAD
AND TURN IT INTO YOURS, IT'S

01:17:37.524 --> 01:17:39.626
UNBELIEVABLE.
BILLIE SINGS IT COMPLETELY

01:17:39.626 --> 01:17:41.327
DIFFERENT TO THAT, AND I JUST
NINI-FIED IT.

01:17:41.327 --> 01:17:46.533

RETREAT UP IN WASHINGTON.

MY NEWEST FAN, THOUGH, HE WAS
BORN ON THE DAY OF MY BLIND

01:19:23.563 --> 01:19:26.232
AUDITION, AND HE'S MY NEWBORN
NEPHEW.

01:19:26.232 --> 01:19:28.034
HE WEARS HIS LITTLE LILA ONESIE
EVERY MONDAY NIGHT.

01:19:28.034 --> 01:19:32.539
>> YOUR FANS HAVE BEEN ASKING
YOU TO SING SOME JONI MITCHELL.

01:19:32.539 --> 01:19:34.441

01:19:38.278 --> 01:19:40.313
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY
DOPE.

01:19:40.313 --> 01:19:43.917

SHE'S A BEAUTIFUL VOCALIST.

01:19:56.296 --> 01:19:57.664
I WANT LILA TO BE IN THE FINALS.
YOU SOUND GORGEOUS.

01:19:57.664 --> 01:20:03.536
>> THANK YOU.
>> YOU ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT

01:20:03.536 --> 01:20:04.571
FROM EVERYBODY ELSE, AND IT'S
AMAZING.

01:20:04.571 --> 01:20:05.739
I REMEMBER WHEN "ORDINARY
PEOPLE" CAME OUT.

01:20:05.739 --> 01:20:08.041
IT WAS THE ONLY THING LIKE IT ON
HIP HOP RADIO.

01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:09.509
THE FIRST TIME THEY HEARD ME,
THEY STOPPED AND WERE LIKE,

01:20:09.509 --> 01:20:12.312
WHAT'S THAT?
YOU GET TO BE LIKE WHAT MAKES

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:13.747
EVERYBODY STOP AND SAY, WHAT'S
THAT?

01:20:13.747 --> 01:20:16.616
>> YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
>> I HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT

01:20:16.616 --> 01:20:19.586
LITTLE MELODIC THINGS YOU CAN DO
TO MAKE IT FUN.

01:20:19.586 --> 01:20:22.822
COMING OUT OF THAT SECOND VERSE.
>> COOL.

01:20:22.822 --> 01:20:29.529
>> OH, I WISH I HAD A RIVER.
"I COULD SKATE AWAY" * I COULD

01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:31.264
SKATE AWAY *
>> I FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND

01:20:31.264 --> 01:20:33.566
JOHN.
HE BELIEVES IN ME.

01:20:33.566 --> 01:20:38.271
I CAN THINK ABOUT TIMES IN MY
LIFE WHERE I HAVE HAD MENTORS.

01:20:38.271 --> 01:20:40.674
PUTTING ME DOWN, SAYING I'M NOT
GOOD ENOUGH.

01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:44.144
IT MEANS SO MUCH TO BE WHERE I
AM NOW AND HAVE THIS PERSON

01:20:44.144 --> 01:20:49.749
TELLING ME THAT I AM ENOUGH, AND
IT GIVES ME THE CONFIDENCE THAT

01:20:49.749 --> 01:20:51.051
I KNOW I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO MAKE
IT TO THE FINALE.

01:20:51.051 --> 01:21:01.728
I KNOW I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN
THIS THING.

01:21:01.728 --> 01:21:02.328
THIS THING.
IT'S LIKE, CHANGED MY LIFE.

AND SINGING SONGS

01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:21.881
OF JOY AND PEACE *

* OH, I WISH I HAD A RIVER
THAT I COULD SKATE AWAY ON *

01:22:37.424 --> 01:22:39.159

RIDICULOUS.

YOU HAVE GOT TO FEEL SO GOOD
AFTER THAT PERFORMANCE, AND I

01:24:24.397 --> 01:24:27.434
FEEL FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SAID
