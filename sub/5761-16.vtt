WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:10.400
My name is Melinda Gordon.

00:10.500 --> 00:11.700
I'm married...

00:11.800 --> 00:14.000
I live in a small town...

00:14.100 --> 00:16.000
and I own antique shop.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.000
I might be just like you...

00:18.100 --> 00:19.800
except that from the time
I was a little girl,

00:19.900 --> 00:22.400
I knew that I could talk to the dead.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.500
It's all right, honey.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.600
"Earth-bound spirits,"
my grandmother called them.

00:26.707 --> 00:29.400
They're stuck here because they have
unfinished business with the living

00:29.503 --> 00:33.202
and they come to me for help.

00:34.708 --> 00:40.102
In order to tell you my story,
I have to tell you theirs.

00:47.907 --> 00:51.705
Here it is. I think you're gonna be
very pleased, Delia.

00:51.809 --> 00:55.103
Oh, Randy, you did a wonderful job.
It looks brand-new.

00:55.207 --> 00:57.100
Yeah, it took a month,
but I tracked down the perfect match

00:57.207 --> 00:58.500
for that emerald you lost.

00:58.605 --> 01:02.901
- You can't even tell which one is new.
- It is a gorgeous ring.

01:03.007 --> 01:06.203
Charlie had such great taste,
and he knew I loved antiques, so...

01:06.307 --> 01:09.101
Do you want to wear it now?

01:09.207 --> 01:12.000
- You know what? Why don't you
just wrap it up for me? - Sure.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.901
- Hey, how's your baby?
- She's perfect.

01:14.006 --> 01:17.203
She sleeps a lot, and the best of all,
she looks like Lynn.

01:17.306 --> 01:19.800
- How old?
- She's 6 months.

01:19.907 --> 01:21.802
Tick, tick, tick.

01:21.908 --> 01:23.500
You know, why are you
always doing that?

01:23.605 --> 01:26.600
I mean, I'm not even 30.
I still have time, right?

01:26.706 --> 01:29.202
I kid because I love.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.200
Everybody on the floor! Now!

01:31.307 --> 01:34.603
Put your hands behind your head,
and no talking!

01:34.705 --> 01:37.601
Eyes to the floor!
Do it!

01:37.705 --> 01:40.501
You! Get down!

01:46.105 --> 01:50.302
Nobody move and nobody will get hurt!

01:52.507 --> 01:55.202
Nobody move!

01:59.606 --> 02:01.501
What are you doing?!

02:01.607 --> 02:04.303
My inhaler!

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074

02:28.307 --> 02:30.902
Anybody else want to be a hero?!

02:31.006 --> 02:32.603
Yeah, I didn't think so.

02:32.708 --> 02:34.202
Get up!

02:34.306 --> 02:35.903
Back room!

02:36.008 --> 02:40.303
Anybody even twitches, I'll shoot him.

02:42.908 --> 02:46.501
- Are you ok?
- Yeah. You?

02:51.707 --> 02:53.300
Did I hear you say something?

02:53.406 --> 02:56.200
I told you not to look at me.

02:56.308 --> 03:00.600
Now, you all have a wonderful day now.

03:31.008 --> 03:35.102
Episode 2x16
"The Cradle Will Rock"

03:37.407 --> 03:39.502
And what else do you remember?

03:39.605 --> 03:41.802
He was tall, intimidating.

03:41.908 --> 03:43.900
I feel much better. Thanks.

03:44.008 --> 03:45.302
Is there anybody
who can drive you home?

03:45.408 --> 03:47.001
Oh, yeah. My wife, Lynn.

03:47.105 --> 03:51.603
If you find that bag of jewelry,
can you look for this art deco ring?

03:51.708 --> 03:56.001
It had emeralds in it.
It was, um... my engagement ring.

03:56.105 --> 03:56.900
I will.

03:57.007 --> 03:58.101
Hey, Barrett.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.801
Excuse me.

04:06.307 --> 04:07.701
How are we all doing?

04:07.806 --> 04:12.402
- We're fine.
- I'm just a little shaken up.

04:12.508 --> 04:14.701
I'm really glad you're here.

04:14.808 --> 04:17.600
This is crazy.

04:24.206 --> 04:26.200
Hey, you want me to take over
for a little bit before I go?

04:26.307 --> 04:29.201
No, I'm good.
It's actually kind of therapeutic.

04:29.307 --> 04:32.800
Remind me, we moved to Grandview
because it was quiet and safe?

04:32.906 --> 04:38.600
It's been a long time since anything
living scared me like that.

04:38.708 --> 04:39.803
I hate that you had to
go through that.

04:39.908 --> 04:42.200
Is Randy going to be ok?

04:42.308 --> 04:44.602
Yeah, he'll be fine. He's just got to
spend a little time on his own,

04:44.708 --> 04:48.400
take some rest, he'll be ok.

04:49.606 --> 04:55.600
- You sure you're going to be ok?
- Yeah, I'm just glad to be home.

04:56.508 --> 04:58.702
Look...

04:58.808 --> 05:01.501
- I'm just going to call in sick.
- What? Why would you do that?

05:01.606 --> 05:04.700
You know, I'm sick of this
split schedule and...

05:04.808 --> 05:08.202
- I just don't think you should be
alone right now. - Are you... I am...

05:08.307 --> 05:10.901
I am fine, and a lot tougher
than you think I am.

05:11.005 --> 05:13.803
- Right. I know. I just...
- Look, you are going to work, ok?

05:13.906 --> 05:15.800
And I...

05:15.905 --> 05:18.500
I'm cooking.

05:18.607 --> 05:21.203
All right.

05:25.108 --> 05:28.100
I  am having a perfect evening.

05:28.205 --> 05:32.601
I just took off an exfoliating mask,
and I am watching movies

05:32.705 --> 05:36.800
that you normally make me
put back at the video store.

05:36.905 --> 05:41.001
Yes, "The Sisterhood of the
Traveling Pants" is one of them.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.001
Come on. It's sweet.

05:44.108 --> 05:46.700
When are you going to come home?

05:46.807 --> 05:50.501
No. Wake me up.
I don't mind.

06:15.007 --> 06:17.101
I've been having nightmares, too.

06:17.205 --> 06:19.503
I guess it affected me more
than I'd like to admit.

06:19.606 --> 06:21.902
Well, I've been on edge all morning.

06:22.007 --> 06:25.101
I tossed and turned
all night last night.

06:25.208 --> 06:28.302
I keep... obsessing about the ring.

06:28.405 --> 06:31.202
I am just so pissed that
I didn't just put it on my finger.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.102
And then I feel guilty because
I'm obsessing about an object

06:34.207 --> 06:37.402
when all that really matters
is that nobody got hurt.

06:37.507 --> 06:43.101
Hey, Charlie gave you that ring.
It's ok to obsess about it.

06:44.106 --> 06:49.203
It's just that it reminded me of
this very innocent time with him.

06:49.308 --> 06:51.802
Got a lot of memories attached to it.

06:51.908 --> 06:55.002
I'm sure there are.

06:57.705 --> 07:02.703
Hi. Just... just let us know
if you need any help.

07:03.406 --> 07:06.600
You know, it says that the robber
got away with 35 grand in jewelry

07:06.705 --> 07:08.403
and over 75 grand in cash.

07:08.507 --> 07:10.500
Yeah, I know. I heard that
on the news last night.

07:10.608 --> 07:12.803
What were they doing with
so much cash in their store?

07:12.905 --> 07:16.301
Can you believe how fast that guy was?
I mean, it was like two minutes.

07:16.407 --> 07:20.301
Felt like about two years to me.

07:20.408 --> 07:22.802
You know what?
I'm feeling a little skittish.

07:22.907 --> 07:28.100
- Do you mind if I just get some air?
- No. Go ahead.

07:28.607 --> 07:29.501
You want anything?

07:29.607 --> 07:35.902
You know what? If you go by Village
Java, an herbal tea would be great.

07:56.607 --> 07:59.503
I can help you.

08:16.008 --> 08:18.501
I just spoke to mr. Kaehler.
It's about Randy.

08:18.605 --> 08:20.002
He's dead.

08:20.105 --> 08:25.801
His wife found him this morning.
They think it was his asthma.

08:30.005 --> 08:35.400
Now, Randy's sister Sally
would like to say a few words.

08:41.607 --> 08:46.002
Three days ago, my sister-in-law
lost her husband,

08:46.105 --> 08:49.601
a little girl lost her father...

08:49.705 --> 08:53.001
And I lost my brother.

08:55.908 --> 08:59.402
This town lost a good man.

08:59.508 --> 09:03.700
He was just trying to make a living
and do the right thing...

09:03.807 --> 09:06.703
No  one else sees me?

09:06.805 --> 09:07.703
Just you?

09:07.806 --> 09:12.301
He was just a simple man,
who loved people.

09:12.407 --> 09:15.503
He was just a gentle soul.

09:15.605 --> 09:19.502
We're going to miss you, Randy. 

09:26.905 --> 09:31.003
Oh, Lynn, I just...
want to tell you how sorry I am.

09:31.108 --> 09:35.301
- He was a really good man.
- I still can't believe he's gone.

09:35.408 --> 09:39.003
I keep waiting for him
to just walk up to me,

09:39.108 --> 09:43.602
take the baby,
and ask me how my day was.

09:45.107 --> 09:47.102
I wanted to introduce you
to my friend Melinda.

09:47.205 --> 09:49.601
We were both in the store
when it happened.

09:49.705 --> 09:53.300
Your husband acted very bravely.
I'm really grateful to him.

09:53.408 --> 09:56.902
Thank you for telling me that.
It means a lot.

09:57.005 --> 09:59.401
She's so beautiful.

09:59.505 --> 10:02.401
I  feel like he's watching over her.

10:02.507 --> 10:05.401
I'm sure he is.

10:10.108 --> 10:12.303
- Melinda?
- Are you all right?

10:12.506 --> 10:15.503
Can I get you some water or something?

10:15.607 --> 10:17.402
I think it's just allergies.

10:17.505 --> 10:20.001
Find it!

10:27.706 --> 10:30.602
I still think we should just
close the store for the day.

10:30.708 --> 10:33.103
I don't know if I can concentrate
with everything that's just happened.

10:33.206 --> 10:36.401
Which is exactly why we should
work today, just stay focused.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.400
Yeah, but don't you think
we need a minute?

10:38.507 --> 10:43.201
I mean, just to, I don't know,
let it sink in?

10:43.308 --> 10:47.000
Yeah, but I do that by staying busy.

10:47.103 --> 10:50.702
I do it by sitting on the couch,
staring out the window with my mouth open.

10:50.808 --> 10:55.702
Well, we all have our own way
of dealing with it.

11:01.807 --> 11:04.105
What?

11:15.709 --> 11:16.702
Are you all right?

11:16.805 --> 11:21.400
Yeah. Yeah.
I just thought I saw something.

11:22.005 --> 11:24.601
I think he was building a cradle
when he died.

11:24.707 --> 11:26.400
- In the basement?
- Exactly.

11:26.506 --> 11:28.602
- As a surprise for his family?
- Keep going.

11:28.707 --> 11:31.100
And he wants you to tell
his wife where it's hidden.

11:31.206 --> 11:34.302
See? We could practically go
into business together on this.

11:34.405 --> 11:35.701
- Wait a minute. Aren't we already?
- Good point.

11:35.806 --> 11:38.502
Ok, that wasn't even a challenge.
Give me a hard one.

11:38.607 --> 11:40.502
Be careful what you wish for there,
wise guy.

11:40.607 --> 11:43.700
All right, what are you going to do?
You're going to go bang on his wife's
door and tell her,

11:43.807 --> 11:45.000
"there's a surprise in your basement?"

11:45.105 --> 11:47.700
No, I'm going to tell her
Randy's here.

11:47.806 --> 11:49.603
Do you think
she's going to believe you?

11:49.707 --> 11:51.701
It's the time when
people are most likely to.

11:51.805 --> 11:54.803
After a loss, you know,
they really want to believe.

11:54.908 --> 11:56.603
- It's amazing.
- What?

11:56.708 --> 11:59.900
Just that you can do this, you know?
That you can make the difference.

12:00.006 --> 12:01.903
Look at the impact you have
on people's lives.

12:02.008 --> 12:06.500
Is it worth the impact
it has on our lives?

12:06.607 --> 12:11.103
Yeah, even though
I don't always think so.

12:11.708 --> 12:16.302
All right. Enough philosophy.
Time for food.

12:21.505 --> 12:22.400
You bought me roses.

12:22.506 --> 12:25.000
Dr. Phil encourages the occasional
romantic gesture.

12:25.107 --> 12:27.600
It's a signal from Randy.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.000
Thought it was a signal from me,
saying, "I love my crazy wife."

12:30.106 --> 12:32.103
I just wonder what it means.

12:32.207 --> 12:36.603
I think it means
Randy owes me 50 bucks.

12:49.608 --> 12:51.803
- Can I help you?
- Hi. Is Lynn here?

12:51.906 --> 12:54.803
- No. She went back to work.
- Oh. I'm Melinda.

12:54.908 --> 12:58.601
- We met at Randy's funeral.
- Yeah, I remember.

12:58.708 --> 13:02.401
Do you know when she'll
be back from work?

13:02.505 --> 13:04.003
What is this... what is this about?

13:04.106 --> 13:07.803
I'm sorry. I just have to talk to her.
I have a message from Randy.

13:07.907 --> 13:11.202
- What?
- About Randy.

13:11.606 --> 13:13.100
Why don't you come in for a minute?

13:13.207 --> 13:15.802
- Well, that's ok. I can come back
if it's a bad time. - Just come in.

13:15.905 --> 13:18.302
I actually have to change Rose.

13:18.407 --> 13:21.403
Her name is Rose?

13:30.106 --> 13:33.201
Nap time, finally.

13:40.006 --> 13:44.502
Oh, sorry the room's such a mess.
I was...

13:44.705 --> 13:48.600
trying to find her favorite teddy,
and of course, it was at the bottom
of the trunk.

13:48.707 --> 13:51.701
Want some coffee?

13:52.105 --> 13:54.402
So, what's the message about Randy?

13:54.508 --> 13:57.701
Oh, it's just something I needed
to talk to Lynn about.

13:57.808 --> 13:59.902
Randy was my brother.
You can tell me.

14:00.006 --> 14:02.300
I know. It's just personal.

14:02.405 --> 14:04.600
You know, I can come back tonight
if that works better.

14:04.707 --> 14:06.902
Lynn works just 5 minutes away.
I can call her.

14:07.007 --> 14:08.903
Well, where does she work?
Because I could go there.

14:09.006 --> 14:13.202
Oh, no, no, no.
Just let me call her.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.900
She's on her way.

14:37.005 --> 14:38.801
You know what?
I have to get going.

14:38.908 --> 14:42.102
- Um, my husband's expecting me...
- She'll just be here in a few minutes.

14:42.205 --> 14:45.601
No, I really have to go.

14:46.508 --> 14:51.303
I'm sorry. I'm really
going to have to insist.

15:01.008 --> 15:03.703
Is that her?

15:12.506 --> 15:15.001
Get out.

15:20.206 --> 15:21.603
How's it going?

15:21.705 --> 15:24.403
I don't know what's happening,
but I need to leave.

15:24.507 --> 15:27.001
- I'm expected...
- Take it easy. All right?

15:27.108 --> 15:30.503
It's no big deal.
You want to go, you can go.

15:30.605 --> 15:32.600
Just tell me what the message is.

15:32.706 --> 15:37.601
It's just something
that I wanted to say to Lynn.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.602
You had a little thing
with Randy, did you?

15:39.707 --> 15:42.701
No. I'm married.

15:46.207 --> 15:49.303
Well, let me tell you something.

15:49.408 --> 15:54.903
There's a lot of married people
who like some candy on the side.

15:55.005 --> 15:57.800
Well, I don't, and my husband's going
to be wondering where I am, so...

15:57.905 --> 16:01.601
Don't be stupid, ok, Melinda?

16:02.807 --> 16:07.401
Just tell me what Randy
wanted Lynn to know.

16:08.705 --> 16:12.601
We're having fun now,
though, aren't we?

16:12.705 --> 16:16.801
But I'm going to get
serious in a minute.

16:16.907 --> 16:20.403
There's a cradle in the basement
Randy was working on before he died.

16:20.507 --> 16:27.103
He wanted Lynn to know that it was down
there. That's it. That's the message.

16:27.605 --> 16:30.201
Good girl.

16:33.608 --> 16:35.600
When did he tell you about the cradle?

16:35.708 --> 16:38.100
- Not that long ago.
- And why? Why'd he tell you?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.801
Because  I was the only one
listening at the time.

16:40.906 --> 16:42.701
Yeah, I'll bet.

16:42.805 --> 16:47.301
- Well, where is it, huh?
- I don't know.

16:49.405 --> 16:54.501
- Where is it?
- Why in the hell are you asking me?

17:05.305 --> 17:09.703
- This where the money is?
- What money?

17:16.406 --> 17:20.103
This where it is?
Huh, Randy?

17:29.406 --> 17:30.802
Well, where is it?

17:30.905 --> 17:33.700
Where is it?!

17:38.205 --> 17:40.601
What the hell are you doing?

17:40.707 --> 17:42.801
Why are you doing this?
Just tell me where the money is.

17:42.905 --> 17:46.303
Who are you talking to?!

17:47.208 --> 17:52.900
Randy is here, his spirit.
That's how I knew about the cradle.

17:54.608 --> 17:56.800
Ok.

17:57.808 --> 17:59.200
Right.

17:59.306 --> 18:01.201
Maybe Randy is here.

18:01.306 --> 18:04.603
This is where he died.

18:08.006 --> 18:11.202
Locked down in the basement,

18:11.307 --> 18:14.200
all by himself.

18:15.107 --> 18:18.903
Now, when you remember
where that money is...

18:19.007 --> 18:22.400
you give me a shout, ok?

18:37.106 --> 18:39.300
Excuse me.
Can you tell me how much this is?

18:39.405 --> 18:42.200
Oh, there's no price on it?

18:42.306 --> 18:47.300
Oh! Heavy. Hang on a second.
I'll find out for you.

18:49.408 --> 18:51.402
What are you doing?
I already checked in here.

18:51.507 --> 18:55.201
Yeah? You got a better idea?

18:58.406 --> 19:01.001
No answer.

19:09.107 --> 19:11.103
Are you all right?

19:11.208 --> 19:13.800
No. Are you kidding?

19:13.906 --> 19:15.903
Get me out of here.

19:16.007 --> 19:19.001
Yeah, I will, I will.
Wyatt's going to leave in a minute.

19:19.105 --> 19:20.500
He wants me to watch you.

19:20.606 --> 19:22.601
Where the hell is it? Damn it!

19:22.708 --> 19:26.902
He's crazy, but I'll get you out of
here as soon as we hear his car leave.

19:27.006 --> 19:31.301
- Wyatt robbed the jewelry store,
didn't he? - Yeah.

19:31.408 --> 19:33.901
Where's the baby?

19:34.005 --> 19:34.603
Upstairs.

19:34.708 --> 19:39.102
- You left her up there with him?
- It's ok. He'd never hurt her.

19:39.208 --> 19:43.600
Wyatt said that you
act like Randy's here,

19:43.705 --> 19:46.003
like you see his ghost or something.

19:46.107 --> 19:49.301
Can you? Can you see my brother?

19:49.406 --> 19:51.502
He did this to me.

19:51.606 --> 19:52.902
He did!

19:53.008 --> 19:56.902
Yeah. I can see him.
He's right behind you.

19:57.007 --> 20:02.602
If that kind of thing was true,
could he hear me and see me?

20:05.908 --> 20:10.900
Because if that kind of thing is true,
I want to tell him that I'm sorry that,

20:11.008 --> 20:14.603
that things got messed up and
they weren't supposed to.

20:14.707 --> 20:18.400
Ok, look. Sally?
If you leave me down here like this,

20:18.505 --> 20:20.401
you're only going to be
in the same trouble as Wyatt,

20:20.508 --> 20:26.200
so why don't you do the right 
thing, ok? Just do it for Randy.

20:26.605 --> 20:30.301
Don't talk to me like
I haven't done for Randy.

20:30.406 --> 20:33.201
He was the kind of kid
that needed protecting.

20:33.306 --> 20:37.001
- He was a sickly kid growing up.
- Tell her.

20:37.107 --> 20:38.902
He's saying that your husband
did this to him.

20:39.007 --> 20:43.201
I know, I know.
He did it to both of us.

20:43.306 --> 20:45.701
And now we're in so deep.

20:45.806 --> 20:48.601
He killed me.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.202
What? What is it?

20:58.306 --> 21:01.301
Wyatt  killed him.

21:02.406 --> 21:05.202
No, that can't be.

21:05.306 --> 21:10.403
Wyatt knows how much Randy
means to me... uh, meant.

21:12.906 --> 21:18.003
Ok, he's gone. Let's go.
I'll take you out of here.

21:19.108 --> 21:20.701
You know what?

21:20.807 --> 21:23.402
If you know where the money is,

21:23.506 --> 21:28.503
then if you told me, then we could
split it and I could get away from Wyatt.

21:28.605 --> 21:29.803
He'd never have to know.

21:29.906 --> 21:31.600
Don't you think if I knew
where the money was,

21:31.705 --> 21:34.602
I would have told him an hour ago?

21:34.707 --> 21:39.803
I don't care about the money.
I just want to go home.

21:39.906 --> 21:42.300
Wyatt!

21:45.808 --> 21:50.903
If she knows where the money is,
she's not telling.

21:52.306 --> 21:54.700
Please!

22:01.708 --> 22:04.203
She's lying.

22:04.306 --> 22:05.603
I don't think so.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.202
She's not going to play games.
She's scared to death.

22:08.305 --> 22:11.703
Yeah? She tell you she sees Randy?

22:11.806 --> 22:12.801
Yeah.

22:12.907 --> 22:15.400
She said he was right there with us.

22:15.506 --> 22:16.903
Gave me chills.

22:17.007 --> 22:20.302
So what? What, is she nuts?

22:20.406 --> 22:25.803
Why would she be here if it wasn't
to tell Lynn where the money is?

22:25.907 --> 22:29.701
She says that Randy told her
that you killed him.

22:29.805 --> 22:33.500
So you tell me. Is she nuts?

22:33.706 --> 22:36.200
Maybe you're both nuts.

22:36.307 --> 22:38.403
All right, take Rose to the apartment.
I am going to tear this place

22:38.505 --> 22:43.802
upside down until I find what I am
looking for, and I will find it.

22:43.907 --> 22:46.403
Now, go.

22:50.006 --> 22:52.103
Why the hell won't you tell me
what he wants to know?

22:52.205 --> 22:54.002
I am. I will.

22:54.108 --> 22:56.803
Yeah, right.

22:57.605 --> 22:59.203
Is it true?

22:59.308 --> 23:04.702
Did you die in this basement?
Did he do something to you?

23:06.108 --> 23:09.200
- You were in on it.
- I had to.

23:09.306 --> 23:14.103
- Nobody has to do something like that.
- I did it for my daughter, for Rose.

23:14.206 --> 23:16.802
What's wrong with Rose?

23:16.908 --> 23:20.700
She was born too soon.
It was a miracle she lived.

23:20.807 --> 23:22.703
The day we got her home...

23:22.805 --> 23:25.503
to her house, her room...

23:25.605 --> 23:27.900
I never had another day like that.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.202
No insurance, hospital bills,
thousands and thousands...

23:31.307 --> 23:36.500
- Still doesn't mean you should steal.
- I was... so desperate.

23:36.606 --> 23:40.102
Wyatt came to me with this plan.

23:40.205 --> 23:42.501
He told me I would look innocent.

23:42.605 --> 23:47.900
Nothing would happen to me, and I'd
have enough money to take care of Rose.

23:48.006 --> 23:52.101
There was nothing I wouldn't do
to protect her.

23:52.207 --> 23:54.301
What did your wife
think about all this?

23:54.405 --> 23:57.001
Lynn doesn't know.

23:57.106 --> 24:00.103
She was so glad
I wasn't hurt in the robbery.

24:00.205 --> 24:02.503
What happened after the robbery?

24:02.607 --> 24:06.700
I didn't really think
I could trust Wyatt or Sally.

24:06.807 --> 24:10.803
She's my sister,
but she'll do anything Wyatt wanted.

24:10.905 --> 24:14.702
I was afraid they'd leave town,
double-cross me,

24:14.808 --> 24:20.600
so I managed to get my hands on the
money and I let Wyatt take the jewels.

24:20.705 --> 24:24.200
He, uh, came here when
Lynn was out with Rose.

24:24.307 --> 24:26.003
Wyatt! Wyatt!

24:26.105 --> 24:28.802
He locked me down here.

24:28.908 --> 24:34.702
He wouldn't let me come up till
I told him where the money was.

24:36.006 --> 24:39.402
Just tell me what it is that
he wants so he can let me go.

24:39.506 --> 24:42.800
I don't know if he will let you go.

24:42.908 --> 24:45.602
- Ok, you have to help me get out
of here. - You have to help me, too.

24:45.705 --> 24:47.101
- How?
- The key.

24:47.207 --> 24:50.303
Give Lynn the key.

25:08.306 --> 25:11.103
You help me...

25:12.705 --> 25:15.401
and then I help you.

25:15.508 --> 25:19.002
I'll get you out of here.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.601
I have an idea.

25:50.108 --> 25:53.203
What is it, honey?

26:10.207 --> 26:11.601
Hey, lady, move it.

26:11.705 --> 26:13.901
Go!

26:20.706 --> 26:22.900
Now.

26:51.906 --> 26:54.701
Randy, what are you doing?
Let me out.

26:54.806 --> 26:59.302
I'm really sorry.
I just can't let you go.

27:06.008 --> 27:07.300
Randy, open the door.

27:07.405 --> 27:10.001
We have to wait for Lynn.
You give her the key, then you go.

27:10.106 --> 27:13.300
What? There is a man with
a gun in that basement.

27:13.405 --> 27:15.101
Do you want your wife
to come home to that?

27:15.208 --> 27:17.403
If I let you go now,
you'll go straight to the police.

27:17.507 --> 27:22.302
I can't let that happen
until Lynn gets the key.

27:22.406 --> 27:24.302
I'm really sorry.

27:24.405 --> 27:29.300
Please understand.
I just can't take any chances.

28:05.505 --> 28:09.601
Look, you and me, we got better
things to do than this.

28:09.708 --> 28:15.302
Just tell me where the money is,
and I'll let you walk away.

28:42.306 --> 28:44.700
I'll be damned.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.200
Randy. 

28:48.008 --> 28:50.702
Is that you?

28:58.808 --> 29:00.900
Hey, Delia.
You know where Melinda is?

29:01.008 --> 29:03.201
Yeah, I think she went over to
Lynn's to bring her some cookies.

29:03.306 --> 29:06.302
- Yeah, but she should be back by now.
- Yeah, I thought she went home.

29:06.405 --> 29:09.402
- You know where Lynn's house is?
- Um, I think so.

29:09.508 --> 29:14.802
We shipped something over to Randy
a while ago, so let me see.

29:14.905 --> 29:16.700
Thanks.

29:16.808 --> 29:19.502
Right  here.

29:19.906 --> 29:23.000
I know the street.
Call me if she shows up.

29:23.107 --> 29:26.803
Maybe we could talk about...

29:29.506 --> 29:32.702
Hey, you think he's some
innocent victim in all this?

29:32.805 --> 29:36.401
No, he's playing you, girlfriend,
just like he played me.

29:36.607 --> 29:40.901
Don't listen to him.
He'll say anything.

29:41.805 --> 29:44.400
Hey, I didn't even know there'd be
all that cash in the store.

29:44.508 --> 29:46.802
I was just looking for
a little jewelry.

29:46.907 --> 29:48.600
Well, Randy, he double-crossed me.

29:48.706 --> 29:50.302
What is he talking about?

29:50.408 --> 29:53.501
Didn't you, Randy?!

29:59.407 --> 30:03.403
I feel... so lightheaded.
Why do I feel so tired?

30:03.505 --> 30:08.202
It's because you're using up
all your energy.

30:09.607 --> 30:12.401
Wait a minute.

30:12.706 --> 30:16.201
You all have a wonderful day now.

30:16.308 --> 30:20.802
He didn't know about
the 75 grand, did he?

30:31.007 --> 30:33.600
Come on, Mel.

30:33.706 --> 30:35.802
I knew it didn't make any sense.

30:35.905 --> 30:40.301
He didn't have time to go to that safe,
and he left with one bag of jewelry.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.100
You took the money, didn't you?

30:43.208 --> 30:44.600
You took it before the
robbery even happened,

30:44.708 --> 30:47.402
to make sure that it got
blamed on the thief.

30:47.506 --> 30:52.902
- Where'd you put it?
- In my car, but I moved it later.

30:53.506 --> 30:54.702
And you set him up.

30:54.806 --> 30:55.802
Yeah.

30:55.907 --> 30:59.803
Ha ha. Poor Wyatt.
He thought I was so stupid.

30:59.905 --> 31:01.901
Treated me like such an idiot.

31:02.006 --> 31:05.102
Do you think I was going to take a chance
like that for a few thousand in jewels?

31:05.208 --> 31:07.403
And then they reported
the robbery on the news

31:07.506 --> 31:09.002
and how much had been stolen.

31:09.106 --> 31:15.103
You should have seen the look on
Wyatt's face. It was... priceless.

31:19.905 --> 31:25.203
I still thought I had enough time
to get Lynn and Rose and get away.

31:25.308 --> 31:28.403
- That's when he trapped you here?
- Yeah.

31:28.505 --> 31:31.203
And you know the rest.

31:31.308 --> 31:33.600
Do I?

32:15.607 --> 32:18.503
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm looking for Lynn Cooper.

32:18.607 --> 32:20.901
Lynn.

32:21.507 --> 32:25.303
- Welcome home.
- That's Lynn.

32:25.406 --> 32:28.202
She and Randy moved months ago.

32:28.308 --> 32:30.100
- Did they leave any kind
of forwarding address? - No.

32:30.208 --> 32:33.601
I think they just needed
something a bit larger.

32:33.705 --> 32:35.103
Right.

32:35.205 --> 32:38.403
Sorry to bother you.

32:40.607 --> 32:42.302
Where's Rose?

32:42.408 --> 32:45.801
Get inside.
Get in here.

32:49.108 --> 32:52.403
What's wrong with you?

33:00.708 --> 33:02.302
- Get in the kitchen!
- Why?

33:02.407 --> 33:06.601
You want Rose to be an orphan?
Do it!

33:17.108 --> 33:20.203
You remember Lynn.

33:27.107 --> 33:30.502
- Move it! Get over! You, too! Move!
- What the hell is this, Wyatt?

33:30.607 --> 33:33.003
Tell him not to hurt her.
I'll tell him where the money is.

33:33.107 --> 33:35.903
Randy is asking you not to hurt her.
He'll tell you what you want to know.

33:36.007 --> 33:38.602
- What is she talking about?
- I'm not going to hurt you.

33:38.705 --> 33:40.002
I just want to know where my money is.

33:40.105 --> 33:42.801
- What money?
- The money from the robbery.

33:42.905 --> 33:44.901
Your husband and Wyatt
were in on it together.

33:45.006 --> 33:47.301
Oh, well, that's crazy because
Randy would never do that.

33:47.406 --> 33:50.701
Oh, that's the easiest part
of the story to believe, trust me.

33:50.808 --> 33:53.403
- Give her the key.
- Look, Randy has something for you.

33:53.508 --> 33:58.103
He says that you'll know
what to do with it.

33:58.407 --> 34:02.801
Well, whatever this key opens
is where he hid the 75 grand.

34:02.906 --> 34:04.401
It belongs to me.

34:04.506 --> 34:07.502
I don't understand. Why would
Randy send this message to you?

34:07.608 --> 34:10.000
It's complicated.

34:10.105 --> 34:11.101
What does this open, huh?

34:11.206 --> 34:14.902
- It's to my locker at the gym.
- It's to Randy's locker at the gym.

34:15.005 --> 34:16.801
- What?
- What gym? What gym?

34:16.907 --> 34:20.303
Um, the main street gym.

34:22.405 --> 34:24.101
What's happening?
Why haven't you called me?

34:24.206 --> 34:25.703
Don't worry about it!

34:25.806 --> 34:28.203
Just meet me at the gym on main street.

34:28.306 --> 34:32.199
- Where's Melinda? Where's Lynn?
- They're both here with me.

34:32.304 --> 34:36.001
- What are you going to do?
- Just get to the gym!

34:36.105 --> 34:37.699
You park in the lot
and you wait for me.

34:37.806 --> 34:43.502
And when Lynn gives me what I want,
you give the baby to her.

34:52.806 --> 34:55.502
All right, right here. This is it.
Pull in right here.

34:55.605 --> 34:58.300
Now, we are just going to walk
inside and go to the locker.

34:58.407 --> 35:03.800
Just a few more minutes
and this will all be over, girls.

35:05.905 --> 35:09.802
All right, good.
Get out. Get out.

35:09.906 --> 35:12.701
Let's go. Move it.

35:12.805 --> 35:14.103
Which one?

35:14.206 --> 35:16.002
Tell him it's locker 39.

35:16.108 --> 35:18.001
39.

35:18.107 --> 35:20.602
Open it.

35:24.808 --> 35:27.802
- It doesn't work.
- What are you doing?

35:27.908 --> 35:31.901
- It doesn't fit!
- Give me that.

35:33.708 --> 35:36.602
Son of a bitch!

35:51.408 --> 35:54.702
You got to be kidding.

35:54.908 --> 35:58.202
What the hell are you doing?

35:58.307 --> 36:00.003
Where's my money?!

36:00.107 --> 36:05.102
Freeze! Don't move! Hands up!
Let me see them now!

36:11.006 --> 36:12.802
How did you know to call the police?

36:12.908 --> 36:17.200
Well, honey, I didn't. They called me.

36:21.307 --> 36:24.301
Lynn, I'm sorry.

36:30.008 --> 36:31.803
For the record, this is Wyatt Hawkins?

36:31.908 --> 36:34.900
Yes, that's him.

36:35.908 --> 36:40.703
He was my brother, Wyatt,
and you killed him.

36:43.305 --> 36:45.900
Would you tell him that I'm sorry?

36:46.006 --> 36:51.801
Tell him... tell him that I should
have watched over him better.

36:52.308 --> 36:54.200
Come on.

36:54.306 --> 36:56.803
Tell her it's ok.
Tell her I'm fine.

36:56.908 --> 36:59.803
He said it's ok.
It's fine now.

36:59.905 --> 37:05.601
I'm really sorry I let this happen.
Will you watch out for me?

37:17.707 --> 37:19.003
Hey, Melinda.

37:19.108 --> 37:20.903
- Hi. Good morning.
- Morning.

37:21.008 --> 37:22.802
Please tell me you don't need
another statement.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.602
Oh, no, no.
We've got plenty of those.

37:25.708 --> 37:28.301
We just sent Wyatt
for a psych evaluation.

37:28.405 --> 37:32.503
Really? He didn't seem like
he was nut-house crazy.

37:32.607 --> 37:38.200
Well, he said you'd been speaking
with Randy Cooper's ghost.

37:39.205 --> 37:43.403
Does sound kind of nutty, doesn't it?

37:43.506 --> 37:46.402
Yeah, well, he's probably just
angling for an insanity defense.

37:46.507 --> 37:47.203
Right.

37:47.306 --> 37:50.600
Listen. We were able to find all
the jewelry in Wyatt's house,

37:50.708 --> 37:54.003
and I got the ok to give
Delia her ring back...

37:54.105 --> 37:57.803
But I thought you might like to.

37:57.906 --> 38:00.603
I'd love to.

38:01.906 --> 38:04.302
You don't know what this means to me.

38:04.408 --> 38:07.503
I never thought I'd see it again.

38:07.606 --> 38:10.103
Thank you so much.

38:10.208 --> 38:12.502
I can't believe everything
you have just been through.

38:12.607 --> 38:15.201
You know what? I was just at
the wrong place at the wrong time.

38:15.306 --> 38:17.103
It seems to happen to you a lot.

38:17.206 --> 38:20.701
In fact, I was meaning to ask you,
the day I found out that Randy had died,

38:20.806 --> 38:25.303
I saw you in the square
and I was about to tell you, but...

38:25.408 --> 38:27.501
you told me first.

38:27.608 --> 38:29.402
How did you know that?

38:29.505 --> 38:33.202
She doesn't know?
Wow. How did you pull that off?

38:33.306 --> 38:36.601
I... could just see it on your face.

38:36.705 --> 38:38.300
But how?

38:38.408 --> 38:41.100
How did you make the leap
that he had died?

38:41.205 --> 38:44.800
I really don't know how to explain it.
I just... have very good instincts

38:44.905 --> 38:46.402
about these things.

38:46.507 --> 38:48.002
Ok.

38:48.105 --> 38:49.702
You skated on that one.

38:49.806 --> 38:51.903
It's my turn to buy you coffee, right?

38:52.008 --> 38:58.002
No way. No, no, no, no, no.
Coffee is on me, so I'll be right back.

38:59.306 --> 39:01.800
You put my life in danger
and your wife's.

39:01.908 --> 39:04.801
- It--it was a calculated risk.
- You used me.

39:04.908 --> 39:07.401
Look, all I wanted was for Lynn
be taken care of.

39:07.507 --> 39:10.202
Yeah, but nothing came from
any of it, Randy. You're dead,

39:10.307 --> 39:13.502
and your sister and your brother-in-law
are going to prison, and no one but you

39:13.607 --> 39:17.100
knows where the money is, so what
do you want your wife to do now?

39:17.206 --> 39:22.801
I--I tried everything I could.
And now it's time to move on.

39:25.408 --> 39:28.502
Do you see the light?

39:28.607 --> 39:30.803
Yep.

39:31.406 --> 39:33.301
Wait--wait a minute.
Where are you going?

39:33.405 --> 39:37.700
You know, I can't help wondering
what's going to happen to a guy like me

39:37.806 --> 39:40.703
- on the other side of that light.
- You can't stay here.

39:40.806 --> 39:42.801
You're meant to cross over.

39:42.906 --> 39:44.300
Yeah.

39:44.408 --> 39:47.301
Let's just say I got a better offer.

39:47.406 --> 39:49.200
Randy, don't do it.

39:49.306 --> 39:51.403
I know what you're talking about,
who you're talking about.

39:51.508 --> 39:52.602
Don't go to him.

39:52.705 --> 39:56.901
I've already made my deal,
and they want me to give you a message.

39:57.006 --> 39:58.801
What message?

39:58.908 --> 40:02.001
- The dead will walk.
- What does that mean?

40:02.105 --> 40:05.000
You think you know so much.
You don't know anything.

40:05.105 --> 40:09.802
They've shown me things,
so much that's about to happen.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.601
There's no way I'm going to miss it.

40:13.706 --> 40:16.102
Randy?

40:17.807 --> 40:19.702
Melinda?

40:19.806 --> 40:21.703
I didn't know you were there.

40:21.808 --> 40:24.203
Were you just talking to yourself?

40:24.308 --> 40:25.303
Randy.

40:25.408 --> 40:29.503
You know, I was just... thinking
about the money from the robbery

40:29.608 --> 40:31.902
and how frustrated I am
that they didn't find it.

40:32.008 --> 40:33.800
Oh. Well, here.

40:33.908 --> 40:40.002
Didn't you say that Lynn got a key
from Randy? Maybe she knows something.

40:40.106 --> 40:43.502
- Front door is open.
- Car's not here.

40:43.607 --> 40:45.702
Hello?

40:45.808 --> 40:47.500
Hey, Lynn?

40:47.608 --> 40:50.202
Are you here?

40:50.306 --> 40:54.300
Well, she cleared out everything.

40:56.806 --> 41:00.100
Lynn?
Are you up here?

41:03.105 --> 41:06.003
She sure got out of here in a hurry.

41:06.108 --> 41:07.503
You think she knew where the money was?

41:07.606 --> 41:10.202
I don't know, but even if she did,
the police have the key,

41:10.305 --> 41:14.003
so unless she has a duplicate, there's
no way of her really getting to it.

41:14.107 --> 41:18.600
Wow. She left a lot of
great stuff behind.

41:21.306 --> 41:25.403
Would it be immoral/illegal
of us to sell it?

41:25.508 --> 41:27.201
Probably.

41:27.308 --> 41:29.601
What?

41:34.805 --> 41:37.603
Look at this.

41:38.605 --> 41:41.601
- That money was here the whole time.
- I thought the police had the key.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.503
No, it doesn't matter.
It was never locked.

41:44.607 --> 41:50.103
Randy knew that she would
recognize the design on the key.

41:54.307 --> 41:59.903
That's the only signal she needed.
The money was right here.

42:07.308 --> 42:13.903
Which is why she was so confused when
he said that the key was for a locker.

42:20.806 --> 42:24.600
Do you think Lynn has the money?

42:24.705 --> 42:28.900
