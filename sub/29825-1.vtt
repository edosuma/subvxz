03:20.634 --> 03:22.501
[indistinct chatter]

03:29.109 --> 03:29.908
Hello, sir.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.877
Hello, I'm with Estelle.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.479
Ah. She's right this way.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.088
Estelle?

03:43.090 --> 03:45.591
[piano playing softly]

03:45.893 --> 03:46.692
I'm Brian.

03:46.694 --> 03:49.228
Don't tell me I'm late.
       I am never late.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.862
No, no. I'm early.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.600
Oh, I see. Yes.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.235
Well, I'll tell you the truth,

03:56.237 --> 03:59.238
I walked around the place
      a couple of times.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.807
Butterflies in my tummy.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.276
[Estelle] Ah. Vodka martini.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.254
Oh! [inhales sharply]

04:15.256 --> 04:16.887
Not driving then?

04:16.890 --> 04:17.856
[chuckles] No, no.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.692
My grandson's picking me up.
            Stephen.

04:20.694 --> 04:21.692
-Ah.
            -Mm-hm.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.329
Is he your only grandchild?

04:24.999 --> 04:27.299
Yes. The only one.

04:28.168 --> 04:31.270
He's all I've got left.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.739
You've got a son, I remember.

04:33.741 --> 04:37.376
Yes. Robert.
     He lives in Australia.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.512
My Harriet has been gone
      for three years now,

04:40.514 --> 04:43.148
and your husband, Alasdair...

04:43.150 --> 04:44.416
Alasdair. That's right.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.285
Yes, a year.

04:47.021 --> 04:48.453
[sighs]

04:48.856 --> 04:50.055
[sighs]

04:50.791 --> 04:53.692
So, tell me,
   have you done this a lot?

04:53.694 --> 04:57.496
Met people
    on the computer service?

04:58.365 --> 04:59.998
Yes. I have.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.135
Don't you find
     it's always the same?

05:03.137 --> 05:07.072
You mean the anticipation
    followed by the letdown?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.975
Though we never say it,
          of course.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.144
"If you'd only
      described yourself,

05:12.146 --> 05:14.646
shall we say,
        more accurately,

05:14.648 --> 05:17.582
we could have avoided wasting
   all this time and energy,

05:17.584 --> 05:20.852
which, at our stage in life,
    we cannot afford to do."

05:20.854 --> 05:23.588
I believe it's the system
        for mismatching

05:23.590 --> 05:26.325
the delusional
       with the hopeless.

05:26.327 --> 05:27.659
But I tell myself,

05:27.661 --> 05:28.927
"Brace up. Be positive.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.529
This time
     it will be different."

05:30.531 --> 05:33.899
You know, so do I.
   I am the eternal optimist.

05:33.901 --> 05:37.002
I thought as much.

05:37.438 --> 05:41.606
Which is why
   I must now confess to you

05:42.142 --> 05:44.776
a deception on my part.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.747
What I deplore most in life
        is dishonesty.

05:48.749 --> 05:52.117
My name is, in fact,
           not Brian.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.386
It's Roy.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.555
Roy Courtnay.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.091
Oh, I see.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.626
Well, I suppose now's the time

06:01.628 --> 06:06.231
that I tell you that my name
    actually isn't Estelle.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.866
Well, only if it isn't.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.569
[chuckles] It's not.

06:10.938 --> 06:12.804
It's Betty.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.173
Betty McLeish.

06:15.175 --> 06:15.941
Betty.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.777
Oh, I think
       I can handle that.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.713
Hello, Betty.

06:29.289 --> 06:30.922
[horn honks]

06:33.761 --> 06:35.227
Is that your grandson?

06:35.229 --> 06:36.661
Yeah. He's been waiting.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.296
Can we give you
         a lift home?

06:38.298 --> 06:39.431
What? Oh, no, no.

06:39.433 --> 06:40.699
It's just a nip across
        to the station,

06:40.701 --> 06:43.335
a quick walk from Paddington,
     and Bob's your uncle.

06:43.337 --> 06:45.404
So,<i> au revoir,</i> Betty.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.272
Until next time, Roy.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.840
[Roy chuckles]

06:58.185 --> 07:00.152
Will you call?

07:21.308 --> 07:24.476
Go to Stringfellows, please.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.915
[indistinct chattering]

07:35.088 --> 07:36.955
[hostess] Thank you, sir.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.023
Follow me, please.

07:38.025 --> 07:41.193
-[club music playing]
    -[indistinct chattering]

07:53.674 --> 07:55.874
I'm sorry to hold you up.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.610
Unavoidably detained.

07:58.812 --> 08:01.279
-How old was she?
           -[laughs]

08:01.281 --> 08:03.982
-Old enough.
           -[chuckles]

08:03.984 --> 08:07.052
Now we'll have champagne
          all around.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.153
Thank you.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.322
I was just explaining
          the rules.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.991
As a precaution, no names.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.361
The two of us
     have made a good deal
     of money in the past,

08:16.363 --> 08:18.864
which is why I thought
  to give you the opportunity

08:18.866 --> 08:21.967
to buy into
   this new investment group.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.935
Yes. I have made,
        quite recently,

08:23.937 --> 08:26.505
the acquaintance
     of certain gentlemen,

08:26.507 --> 08:30.141
who have £800,000
          to invest.

08:30.143 --> 08:34.379
They know me as a banker,
        slightly bent,

08:34.381 --> 08:36.014
who has guaranteed them

08:36.015 --> 08:37.282
a quick doubling
         of their money

08:37.284 --> 08:41.486
if they invest it
  in the limited partnership.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.621
Which would be us.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.689
But before they put
        their money in,

08:44.691 --> 08:48.226
they want to see us
       put some money in.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.961
Only 200,000.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.596
50,000 from each of us.

08:51.598 --> 08:55.267
No one here is uncomfortable
       with that figure?

08:57.337 --> 08:58.670
Good.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.604
Well, now...

08:59.606 --> 09:01.172
Got a question for you.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.575
Not that I expect
       a straight answer.

09:03.577 --> 09:07.879
This proposition,
     just how dodgy is it?

09:08.682 --> 09:11.316
Well, it's rather difficult
            to say.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.285
See, I rest my case.

09:13.287 --> 09:14.352
Another question,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.988
which I doubt you'll answer
   any more than the first.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.089
Who are they?

09:18.091 --> 09:20.358
Well, like all of us
         at this table,

09:20.360 --> 09:23.094
these men prefer anonymity.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.697
And to your point, um...

09:25.699 --> 09:27.499
Bryn.

09:27.501 --> 09:31.002
Oh, dear.
   The first to break a rule.

09:31.872 --> 09:34.940
But to your point, Bryn,

09:34.942 --> 09:37.309
I can say
  they are foreign nationals,

09:37.311 --> 09:42.581
who desire to become a part
 of the English investor class.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.049
Russians.

09:44.051 --> 09:44.783
Got it in one.

09:44.785 --> 09:48.186
Cossacks.
    I fucking hate Cossacks.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.191
Well, if you can't
         join us, Bryn,

09:53.193 --> 09:55.226
I suggest that
      you remove yourself

09:55.228 --> 09:57.662
from any further discussion.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.730
[chuckles]

09:58.732 --> 10:02.701
I didn't say that,
          did I? Mmm?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.169
Good.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.770
Because the money you put in,

10:05.772 --> 10:09.808
you'll get back
 four times over at the payout.

10:11.211 --> 10:13.745
Ah, thank you, dear.

10:13.747 --> 10:16.681
-[cell phone vibrating]
          -Excuse me.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.617
[keypad beeping]

10:18.819 --> 10:20.418
You called.

10:20.420 --> 10:21.486
[Vincent] Thank you.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.154
[Bryn] Thanks, love.

10:27.461 --> 10:28.493
[exhales]

10:28.495 --> 10:29.527
[Betty exclaims]

10:29.529 --> 10:30.328
[both shudder]

10:30.330 --> 10:32.998
[machine guns firing
           on screen]

10:36.737 --> 10:37.869
Well, I may have
         missed a step,

10:37.871 --> 10:40.071
but I am fairly certain
       that Adolf Hitler

10:40.073 --> 10:41.673
was not machine-gunned
            to death

10:41.675 --> 10:42.774
in a French cinema.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.943
Well, it would have been
  rather good if he had been.

10:44.945 --> 10:45.777
Yeah, but young people,

10:45.779 --> 10:47.012
they go and see a film
           like that

10:47.014 --> 10:49.247
and they think that
 that's what actually happened.

10:49.249 --> 10:51.216
Oh, no, no.
     I taught for 40 years

10:51.218 --> 10:53.618
and this generation
      are far less likely

10:53.620 --> 10:55.353
to believe everything
         they're told

10:55.355 --> 10:56.588
than we were.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.989
[exclaims] Oh, God!

10:57.991 --> 10:59.391
[groans]

10:59.393 --> 11:00.425
Roy, what is it?

11:00.427 --> 11:01.660
No, no. It's my knee.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.096
[groans] It gives way
     sometimes and then...

11:05.098 --> 11:06.998
No, it will be fine
         in a minute.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.834
Here. Here.
  I've got you. I've got you.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.670
-Thanks.
          -All right.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.439
All right now?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.640
Yeah.

11:15.642 --> 11:17.342
[humming]

11:17.344 --> 11:18.977
[both chuckling]

11:29.623 --> 11:31.322
[Roy exclaims]

11:34.928 --> 11:37.962
A titch down on the right.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.131
[exclaims] That's it.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.201
Thank you.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.237
Now, the purpose
    of this joint investment

11:46.239 --> 11:48.573
is the purchase
        of this property

11:48.575 --> 11:49.441
in the Caribbean.

11:49.443 --> 11:51.543
Once the purchase
         goes through,

11:51.545 --> 11:52.844
the property will be resold

11:52.846 --> 11:56.815
by prior arrangement
       at twice the price.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.550
[in Russian accent]
     When do we get profit?

11:58.552 --> 12:00.985
In one week's time.

12:02.189 --> 12:07.292
All transactions
    are done electronically

12:07.294 --> 12:08.760
via these keypads.

12:08.762 --> 12:12.130
-I will now transfer...
      -[keypad clicking]

12:12.132 --> 12:14.032
...our £200,000...

12:15.135 --> 12:18.169
...into the joint
      investment account.

12:18.171 --> 12:23.975
And all you do now
     is transfer your funds

12:23.977 --> 12:26.978
in the amount of £800,000

12:26.980 --> 12:29.714
and, oh, we're tickety-boo.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.884
You put in 200,000.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.886
We put in 800,000.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.121
[Roy] Right.

12:36.123 --> 12:37.655
Your investment
        is the greater,

12:37.657 --> 12:40.959
but then so is your profit.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.894
[chuckling]

12:45.132 --> 12:47.265
Well, if there are
      no more questions...

12:47.267 --> 12:49.033
Yeah, I've got a question.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.669
See, all this money
       you're gonna make,

12:51.671 --> 12:54.005
what's Putin's cut?

12:54.341 --> 12:56.307
[chuckling]

13:06.453 --> 13:08.620
[speaking Russian]

13:08.622 --> 13:10.021
[sighs]

13:12.359 --> 13:13.591
What the fuck was that?

13:13.593 --> 13:15.093
[secretary] I'll see you out.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.795
They were not amused by you.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.596
How'd you know?
    You don't speak Russian.

13:18.598 --> 13:20.165
Don't have to.

13:21.968 --> 13:23.802
Well, how do we get them back?

13:23.804 --> 13:25.804
We'll have to regain
          their trust,

13:25.806 --> 13:27.572
won't we, Bryn?

13:28.441 --> 13:29.841
Yeah.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.376
Bryn.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.914
[Roy whistling]

13:41.288 --> 13:42.587
Heigh-ho!

13:42.589 --> 13:44.589
-[Roy chuckles]
           -[sighs]

13:45.025 --> 13:45.924
Oh.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.091
[Roy panting]

13:47.093 --> 13:48.326
[Betty]
   Has your knee gone again?

13:48.328 --> 13:52.063
Well, it's been like this
      for a few days now.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.331
Why didn't you take a cab?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.033
Oh, I made it here, didn't I?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.302
Yes, and you've probably
         made it worse.

13:57.304 --> 13:58.937
Anyway, it's bloody closed.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.372
Oh, and I didn't call
       to bloody check.

14:01.374 --> 14:04.709
I have made a hash of things,
          haven't I?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.010
[exhales]

14:06.012 --> 14:07.979
[both laughing]

14:10.617 --> 14:12.350
Watch this.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.419
[car alarm beeps]

14:14.421 --> 14:16.487
Well, this is unexpected.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.455
I bought it today.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.857
Did he give you good terms?

14:18.859 --> 14:19.958
You know, these dealers,

14:19.960 --> 14:21.626
they like to take advantage
         of our sorts.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.760
Oh, no, I paid cash.

14:22.762 --> 14:25.496
You stay here,
     I'm gonna pick you up.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.101
You paid cash?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.942
[Betty] What I love most
      is how quiet it is.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.944
[Roy] Mmm.

14:39.946 --> 14:41.479
[Betty] Took some
        getting used to,

14:41.481 --> 14:43.648
but now I really enjoy it.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.958
Wait. Wait, Roy.
         I'll get you.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.627
Just a sec.

14:55.629 --> 14:56.961
[Roy grunts]

14:56.963 --> 14:59.264
-[Roy] Okay.
       -You're all right?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.499
Oh, dear.

15:01.501 --> 15:02.300
[Roy] Yes.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.968
[Betty] Oh, dear, oh, dear.
            There.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.905
-Don't you--
   -No steps. Oh, well done.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.439
-Okay.
         -You're okay?

15:08.441 --> 15:10.141
[Roy] Yes, yes.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.150
Very up-to-the-minute,
           isn't it?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.885
Thought I'd start afresh.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.320
Yeah.

15:30.230 --> 15:31.629
Jesus.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.998
[both laughing]

15:35.135 --> 15:37.735
-[Betty] Unbelievable.
          -Oh, Betty.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.771
This has been a feast.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.538
Just leftovers.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.441
Yes. No, but it's what
       you did with them.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.043
[Stephen] Betty, are you back?

15:45.045 --> 15:46.878
We're here!

15:46.880 --> 15:51.482
Ah. Stephen. The grandson.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.218
Roy Courtnay.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.322
I thought
     you were out tonight.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.656
No, no. We're in.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.824
Roy's knee went out on him.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.360
Oh, really? Should we call
       for an ambulance?

16:02.362 --> 16:03.161
[Roy] Oh, no.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.630
It's nothing
      as dramatic as that.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.332
Does Stephen live here
           with you?

16:07.334 --> 16:09.934
No, no. He's doing his
  doctorate at Royal Holloway.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.070
He just sleeps over
         on occasion.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.072
-Ah.
    -Can I give you a lift?

16:14.074 --> 16:14.706
To?

16:14.708 --> 16:18.242
To wherever it is
        that you live.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.145
Stephen, we haven't
      finished dinner yet.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.983
Oh. I suppose I should be
     getting along, yeah.

16:24.985 --> 16:28.686
Then I insist that
    Stephen drive you home.

16:29.255 --> 16:32.290
I think I'll come along
         for the ride.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.730
[Roy] Many, many thanks.
          Here we go.

16:38.732 --> 16:39.764
Good night.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.399
[Roy grunting]

16:41.701 --> 16:43.634
What floor do you live on?

16:43.636 --> 16:44.602
On the top floor.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.938
You can't go up and down
       all those stairs.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.973
What would you have me do?

16:48.975 --> 16:50.441
Sell up and move?

16:50.443 --> 16:52.844
No, for God's sake.
     Come and stay with me.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.412
-What?
    -I've got a spare room.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.246
What are you doing?

16:55.248 --> 16:56.948
I mean, just till
   you get back on your feet.

16:56.950 --> 17:01.019
Betty, you are as generous
      as you're beautiful.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.520
But no.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.656
[sighs]

17:07.594 --> 17:09.993
[Roy] Whoops.
          There we go.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.796
[Roy grunting]

17:13.066 --> 17:15.032
[groaning]

17:19.939 --> 17:21.739
[panting]

17:25.578 --> 17:27.478
This is ridiculous!

17:28.048 --> 17:31.649
I'm afraid I haven't
  got around to this room yet.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.285
So, it's a bit bare.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.821
But you can use
        all the drawers

17:36.823 --> 17:39.991
and, of course,
     there's the wardrobe,
         that's empty.

17:39.993 --> 17:41.592
Yeah.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.961
So, I'll get you some towels.

17:43.963 --> 17:46.064
Make yourself comfy.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.735
Fat chance of that.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.674
That's very kind.

18:01.714 --> 18:02.613
[sighs]

18:02.615 --> 18:03.714
[man] Keep up.

18:03.716 --> 18:06.384
Plenty of time
      for rest afterwards.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.519
[indistinct chatter]

18:08.521 --> 18:09.754
[man] All there?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.855
Ready?

18:10.857 --> 18:13.291
Two more kilometers.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.495
No dilly-dallying.

18:17.497 --> 18:21.065
[woman] Well, I don't speak
   to him either, I just...

18:21.067 --> 18:25.503
[woman 2] Yes, she's so big,
      I can't believe it.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.538
[man] Come on, ladies.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.474
[car engine starts]

18:30.076 --> 18:32.110
[man] Here we are.

18:48.094 --> 18:50.528
[Stephen] Inviting him
          to move in,

18:50.530 --> 18:51.429
what were you thinking?

18:51.431 --> 18:53.364
[Betty] Oh, please,
       what's the harm?

18:53.366 --> 18:54.932
[Stephen]
    When's the wedding? Huh?

18:54.934 --> 18:55.867
Saturday week?

18:55.869 --> 19:00.538
No, it's too soon
 to be getting so close to him.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.573
I would have thought
   that was the whole point.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.008
Yes, of course
       it is the whole point,

19:04.010 --> 19:07.411
but I didn't think
  it would get this intimate.

19:07.413 --> 19:09.347
Are you talking about me?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.983
Albert Speer.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.851
He's my dissertation subject.

19:13.853 --> 19:14.919
-I was saying...
              -Ah.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.320
[Stephen]
    ...the closer one gets,

19:16.322 --> 19:18.422
the more
     one loses perspective.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.325
You've lost perspective
       on Albert Speer?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.460
[Stephen] Mm-hm.

19:22.462 --> 19:23.294
I'm trying to determine

19:23.296 --> 19:25.630
whether he was the innocent
       he claimed to be.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.932
Oh, I thought
    that had been sorted out

19:27.934 --> 19:29.500
when you were in nappies.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.569
I think these sorts
         of questions

19:31.571 --> 19:34.639
are rarely completely
     sorted out, are they?

19:34.641 --> 19:38.142
Was it history
   that you taught in school?

19:38.144 --> 19:39.544
School?

19:39.846 --> 19:43.347
No, Roy,
    Betty taught at Oxford.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.483
[stutters]

19:45.919 --> 19:50.321
You hide your light
   under a bushel, don't you?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.223
[chuckling]

19:58.665 --> 19:59.463
There he goes,

19:59.465 --> 20:03.100
trailing his cliches
          behind him.

20:03.102 --> 20:05.670
I think he's quite charming.

20:06.139 --> 20:07.438
You did not just say that.

20:07.440 --> 20:11.309
Do I detect
      a touch of jealousy?

20:24.991 --> 20:26.524
[Stephen] Hello.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.093
Betty says
    wherever you need to go,

20:29.095 --> 20:30.628
I'm to take you.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.731
Where to?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.133
Departure lounge
       on the River Styx.

20:36.135 --> 20:40.438
An old friend's
     got pancreatic cancer.
       Said I'd drop by.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.641
Nice. Can I take your bag?

20:43.643 --> 20:45.509
Thank you, Stephen.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.613
-It is very kind.
        -You're welcome.

20:52.218 --> 20:54.585
-Thank you.
      -Mind your fingers.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.357
[boat horn blaring]

20:59.359 --> 21:01.058
[siren wailing]

21:01.060 --> 21:02.760
[indistinct chattering]

21:06.366 --> 21:08.799
Would you like to come
          and see him?

21:08.801 --> 21:12.270
Uh, no. I wouldn't want
          to intrude.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.580
[indistinct chattering]

21:40.233 --> 21:42.333
[Roy] Shall we resume?

21:43.636 --> 21:46.404
Uh, I've got something to say.

21:47.106 --> 21:51.208
I'd like to thank everyone
     for making the effort

21:51.210 --> 21:55.813
to convene us again today
    after our first meeting.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.982
We got off on the wrong foot.

21:57.984 --> 22:02.386
Well, I know I did.
       Unintentionally.

22:02.388 --> 22:07.291
As a gesture of this,
   and to decrease your risk,

22:07.293 --> 22:13.631
we have increased our stake
       to 100,000 each.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.934
Doubling it to £400,000.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.736
Well said, Bryn.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.396
Well.

22:45.398 --> 22:46.964
[laughs]

22:46.966 --> 22:49.200
Let's crack the vodka!

22:49.202 --> 22:51.402
[all chuckling]

22:52.004 --> 22:53.671
[Bryn] All right.

22:53.673 --> 22:54.538
Bryn!

22:54.540 --> 22:55.906
[Vincent] The second time's
           a charm.

22:55.908 --> 22:56.841
[Beni] Good day's work.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.843
[Vlad] I'm pleased.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.177
[chuckles]

23:00.179 --> 23:01.579
[grunts]

23:06.219 --> 23:08.686
He's wearing a fucking wire!

23:10.390 --> 23:11.222
Police.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.089
[tires squealing]

23:12.091 --> 23:14.191
-Police!
     -[sirens approaching]

23:14.193 --> 23:15.726
[Bryn] Fuck!

23:17.697 --> 23:19.497
[indistinct shouting]

23:19.565 --> 23:20.531
[man 1] Police!

23:20.533 --> 23:21.932
-[man 2] Freeze!
     -[man 1] You! Freeze!

23:21.934 --> 23:23.134
[Vincent] Get back!

23:23.136 --> 23:23.834
No, no, no!

23:23.836 --> 23:25.302
That way!
      Use the back stairs!

23:25.304 --> 23:26.704
-[Roy groaning]
 -Use the back stairs! Stairs!

23:26.706 --> 23:29.140
[Man 2] You're under arrest!
          Don't move!

23:29.142 --> 23:29.940
[Man 1] Stop!

23:29.942 --> 23:31.809
[Man 2] Freeze right where
            you are!

23:32.078 --> 23:33.644
[Man 1] Stop!

23:35.081 --> 23:36.714
[chuckling]

23:41.754 --> 23:43.521
[Bryn exclaiming]

23:43.523 --> 23:45.556
Stop! Stop! Stop!

23:45.558 --> 23:48.859
Stop! Stop!

23:48.861 --> 23:51.796
English investor class.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.133
[both laughing]

23:58.571 --> 24:00.404
[Roy] Vlad.

24:00.406 --> 24:02.606
Thank you.
     Well done. Well done.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.909
-[speaking Russian]
    -[all speaking Russian]

24:04.911 --> 24:06.444
[Roy] Tickety-boo!

24:06.446 --> 24:08.012
[all chuckling]

24:12.952 --> 24:15.186
[ambulance siren blaring]

24:15.855 --> 24:18.956
And? Was he glad to see you?

24:19.091 --> 24:22.893
Poor sod didn't even know
         I was there.

24:31.037 --> 24:31.969
[cork pops]

24:31.971 --> 24:32.870
Really? Another bottle?

24:32.872 --> 24:36.307
Your grandmother's
 throwing caution to the wind.

24:36.309 --> 24:37.241
Fine.

24:37.243 --> 24:38.375
No, thank you.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.077
Oh, don't be such a prig!

24:40.079 --> 24:42.379
This is your
       going-away dinner.

24:42.381 --> 24:43.814
[Roy] Yes!

24:43.816 --> 24:47.151
Where is it
      that you're off to?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.419
Uh, some...

24:48.421 --> 24:49.320
Spandau Prison.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.956
Is it for a long stretch?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.524
[Roy and Betty chuckling]

24:53.526 --> 24:54.558
[Stephen] That's funny.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.160
Spandau was where
         Albert Speer

24:56.162 --> 24:58.829
and the rest of the Nazi war
   criminals were imprisoned.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.998
Return to the scene
         of the crime?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.767
Stephen believes
     in the power of place.

25:03.769 --> 25:04.969
[Stephen]
    It's mostly rubble now.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.204
But the past becomes
         more tangible

25:07.206 --> 25:08.873
when one experiences
        the environments

25:08.875 --> 25:09.940
in which they occurred.

25:09.942 --> 25:12.409
I never was one for history.

25:12.411 --> 25:15.913
I mean, what is the point
       in looking back?

25:15.915 --> 25:21.585
What's done is done,
     and you won't undo it.

25:21.587 --> 25:24.588
You may begin
   to understand it, though.

25:24.590 --> 25:25.990
Ah.

25:29.762 --> 25:33.297
Seems like you've had
      quite a past, Roy?

25:33.299 --> 25:34.265
Oh, my!

25:34.267 --> 25:36.534
Enough to last
       several lifetimes.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.837
Were you in any branch
        of the services?

25:41.107 --> 25:42.139
The armed services?

25:42.141 --> 25:44.108
Yeah. The ones
        with guns, yeah.

25:44.110 --> 25:49.013
I did serve in the army,
         as it happens.

25:50.583 --> 25:51.916
The war.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.318
Is that how you got the scar?

25:59.458 --> 26:01.926
On your neck, there.

26:06.766 --> 26:10.968
I told your grandmother
         when we met,

26:10.970 --> 26:15.139
what I deplored most
    in this life was a lie.

26:15.141 --> 26:18.142
So instead of making up
          some story,

26:18.144 --> 26:20.678
I'm going to say that
    I prefer not to discuss

26:20.680 --> 26:26.250
the circumstances
   under which I was wounded.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.753
I withdraw the question.

26:36.963 --> 26:39.697
I did it shaving.

26:39.832 --> 26:41.131
Ah.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.601
[Roy and Betty laughing]

26:49.542 --> 26:53.210
Yes, yes. Very good.
     Very good. [chuckles]

26:54.547 --> 26:56.680
Bye! Good luck!

26:57.183 --> 26:59.183
Well, that was lovely,
           wasn't it?

26:59.185 --> 27:00.351
Did you enjoy that?

27:00.353 --> 27:02.119
[Roy] That's twice now.

27:02.121 --> 27:02.886
Twice what?

27:02.888 --> 27:05.823
Twice that car's come
       sneaking around.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.524
[Betty] Are you sure
       it's the same car?

27:07.526 --> 27:12.029
Yes. Silver Audi
 with a scratch on both sides.

27:12.031 --> 27:14.398
Well, I don't know who it is.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.015
Tickety-boo?

27:31.017 --> 27:33.183
Tickety-fucking-boo.

27:33.185 --> 27:34.952
[car engine starts]

27:34.954 --> 27:37.354
[Roy] <i> Oh, it's good to be back</i>
         <i> in the city.</i>

27:37.356 --> 27:40.891
<i> I don't know how much more</i>
   <i> I can take of that place.</i>

27:40.893 --> 27:44.628
<i> It's like being smothered</i>
           <i> in beige.</i>

27:44.630 --> 27:45.696
[chuckling]

27:45.698 --> 27:48.966
Any grumblings
   from our investment group?

27:48.968 --> 27:52.870
As far as they know,
   you and I are in custody.

27:52.872 --> 27:53.971
Their funds are frozen solid,

27:53.973 --> 27:56.340
and the police
  are on the lookout for them.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.509
Lose a 100 grand apiece.

27:58.511 --> 28:02.112
They've got no one to blame
        but themselves.

28:02.114 --> 28:04.214
Call it a lesson learned.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.216
Well, it is that.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.788
Should we take care
        of our problem?

28:40.986 --> 28:42.419
Vlad?

28:43.622 --> 28:47.391
Vinnie here says that you're
   displeased with your fee.

28:47.393 --> 28:51.061
I don't want a fee.
         I want a cut.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.696
A share in the profits?

28:52.698 --> 28:54.531
[Vlad] Well, same as you.

28:54.533 --> 28:55.699
Same as Vinnie.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.968
I value the verisimilitude

28:57.970 --> 29:01.271
that you bring to the party,
            but I...

29:01.273 --> 29:02.673
Don't fuck with me, Roy.

29:02.675 --> 29:05.175
[Igor] The store is closed.
        Please move on.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.810
I know things about you.

29:06.812 --> 29:09.947
-Who you really are.
         -[door closes]

29:13.018 --> 29:16.987
[Roy] I make allowances
       for poor manners.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.923
I tell myself,
     cultural differences.

29:21.427 --> 29:22.960
Do you know what you'd get

29:22.962 --> 29:27.064
back in Shittingrad
  for what you said just now?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.970
Your head in a bag
 with your balls in your mouth.

29:33.372 --> 29:38.308
I, by contrast,
  prefer an appeal to reason.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.346
No!

29:42.348 --> 29:43.981
[Vlad screaming]

29:45.251 --> 29:47.417
[screaming continues]

29:48.854 --> 29:51.155
Since when do you do
         the shopping?

29:51.157 --> 29:54.658
I'm exploring
    the joys of domesticity.

29:54.660 --> 29:56.794
[Vlad screams loudly]

30:04.003 --> 30:06.170
To new pastures.

30:06.172 --> 30:08.338
How much do you think
         she's worth?

30:08.340 --> 30:10.574
Half a million at least.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.709
The only challenge
        is the grandson.

30:12.711 --> 30:16.046
The little shit's off
   on a wank for a few days,

30:16.048 --> 30:18.215
so this is an ideal window.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.449
[Betty] I'm back!

30:19.451 --> 30:22.519
Here in the kitchen!

30:32.531 --> 30:33.263
Ah, Betty.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.132
-I hope you don't mind...
         -[Betty] Oh!

30:35.134 --> 30:37.601
...but I've invited
        a friend over.

30:37.603 --> 30:40.571
Vincent Halloran.

30:40.573 --> 30:41.405
Betty McLeish.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.106
-[Vincent] Hello.
            -Hello.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.074
[Roy] Vincent is my...

30:44.076 --> 30:45.642
What is it
       you call yourself?

30:45.644 --> 30:48.879
The investment advisor.
 It means glorified accountant.

30:48.881 --> 30:51.148
I'm just helping Roy
          get sorted.

30:51.150 --> 30:52.616
You know, it's my will.

30:52.618 --> 30:54.051
It's not a fortune,

30:54.053 --> 30:57.454
but I've saved all my life,
       and I am thrifty.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.690
As anyone who's ever been
        to a restaurant

30:59.692 --> 31:01.425
with Roy can attest.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.893
It all sounds
       very complicated.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.094
I'll leave you to it.

31:04.096 --> 31:05.095
It's very simple, really.

31:05.097 --> 31:08.432
The goal is just
     to minimize exposure.

31:08.434 --> 31:09.733
Taxes and such.

31:09.735 --> 31:10.834
[Roy] Truth be told,

31:10.836 --> 31:14.905
I was hoping you'd let me
    leave something to you.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.443
What? Roy!

31:19.445 --> 31:21.478
What are you talking about?

31:21.480 --> 31:23.513
How long have we known
          each other?

31:23.515 --> 31:26.783
No! You've got your son
        to think about.

31:26.785 --> 31:29.453
Robert? Oh, no.

31:29.455 --> 31:31.321
He's not in my will.

31:31.323 --> 31:34.258
I don't approve
       of his lifestyle.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.494
He designs kitchens.

31:37.496 --> 31:42.432
Granted my little pot
  probably won't make a ripple
      in what you've got.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.067
People don't like to talk
         about money.

31:44.069 --> 31:47.604
It's a taboo subject,
     but it's so important.

31:47.606 --> 31:50.073
True. Like sex.

31:50.843 --> 31:53.677
Or going to the lavatory.
          [chuckles]

31:53.879 --> 31:54.945
Critically important,

31:54.947 --> 31:57.414
but not a subject
    for polite conversation.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.350
Yes, well, it isn't.
           [stammers]

32:00.352 --> 32:03.720
Well, what I think
        Vincent means is

32:03.722 --> 32:07.024
that we have to look after
    what we worked to secure.

32:07.026 --> 32:12.930
That's right! One's interest,
     one's assets, family.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.866
Might I ask what
     the strategy has been

32:15.868 --> 32:17.067
vis-a-vis your estate?

32:17.069 --> 32:20.037
I don't think you could
      call it a strategy.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.004
Uh...

32:21.006 --> 32:22.105
I've got my savings,

32:22.107 --> 32:25.442
and then I've got the fund
     that Alasdair set up.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.877
And, of course,
        I own this house

32:26.879 --> 32:29.346
because I paid cash for it.

32:29.348 --> 32:36.019
So, if we include the savings,
    the fund, and the house,

32:36.021 --> 32:38.422
your total assets
        might come to...

32:38.424 --> 32:44.494
It's about 2,700,000.
      Something like that.

32:44.496 --> 32:48.432
Maybe 800, I think,
    the last time I looked.

32:48.867 --> 32:51.401
May I call you Betty?

32:52.237 --> 32:53.570
Well, over a 5-year period,

32:53.572 --> 32:55.706
I will project
        an annual return

32:55.708 --> 32:57.441
-of 15 to 20%
        -[Roy whistles]

32:57.443 --> 33:02.813
That is a doubling
  of your money in five years.

33:02.815 --> 33:03.947
Is there a risk?

33:03.949 --> 33:06.049
Well, there's a risk
     in crossing the road.

33:06.051 --> 33:09.119
Another benefit is that
     our investments assist

33:09.121 --> 33:11.421
in the growth
   of underdeveloped nations.

33:11.423 --> 33:15.025
So, your money would be
     helping those in need.

33:15.027 --> 33:17.594
That's nice to know,
           isn't it?

33:17.596 --> 33:20.230
Double my money in five years?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.467
A little more
       wouldn't go amiss.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.702
Now, something for you
        to think about,

33:25.704 --> 33:27.237
and you too, Roy,

33:27.239 --> 33:30.841
is a way to manage
         your overheads

33:30.843 --> 33:32.843
and streamline
        the investments.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.044
Oh, yes, what's that?

33:34.046 --> 33:37.114
Well, to limit
    the administrative costs
    and your tax liability,

33:37.116 --> 33:41.284
you could both open
       a joint portfolio.

33:41.286 --> 33:43.553
You mean combine my money
          with Roy's?

33:43.555 --> 33:47.657
I'm sure you had
       something similar
    with your late husband.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.128
Well, yes,
      but we were married.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.462
Yes. True.

33:52.464 --> 33:56.533
But a combining of the assets
        is the best way

33:56.535 --> 33:59.269
of confounding
      the Inland Revenue.

34:01.140 --> 34:01.905
[sighs]

34:01.907 --> 34:07.344
Well, you certainly have given
   one a lot to think about.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.514
Thank you, um, Vincent.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.393
Vincent.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.339
[car lock chirps]

34:47.753 --> 34:51.353
Do you ever get lonely
            in here?

34:52.024 --> 34:53.156
What?

34:53.158 --> 34:56.860
Oh, this room. So quiet.

35:00.365 --> 35:02.099
Roy, it's lovely of you
        to think of me,

35:02.101 --> 35:03.200
but if you want sex,

35:03.202 --> 35:05.135
I'm afraid
   I'm going to have to pass.

35:05.137 --> 35:06.770
Oh, no, no, no.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.706
No, I wasn't going
        to suggest that.

35:11.844 --> 35:13.009
Just a little cuddle.

35:13.011 --> 35:17.314
I do appreciate it,
      but I've always felt
        our relationship

35:17.316 --> 35:20.784
was more along the lines
      of a companionship.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.421
We've moved on
      from there, surely.

35:24.423 --> 35:28.925
It's not a swollen knee
  that's keeping me here now.

35:28.927 --> 35:32.829
We've developed an intimacy,

35:32.831 --> 35:33.430
closeness.

35:33.432 --> 35:37.200
We're close enough
   that I clean your toilet.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.170
And you do miss on occasion.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.539
I apologize.

35:42.541 --> 35:45.775
I shall attempt
      to make true my aim.

35:47.412 --> 35:49.312
But as to the two of us...

35:49.314 --> 35:52.916
No, Roy. I do.
   I know what you're saying.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.152
It's just that...

35:55.787 --> 35:58.522
Well, Alasdair and I...

35:59.057 --> 36:01.625
Yes, I understand.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.494
Thank you.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.398
I know I'm no treat,

36:08.400 --> 36:12.302
but I've grown
    very fond of you, Betty.

36:12.304 --> 36:13.303
[chuckles]

36:13.305 --> 36:16.873
"Fond"?
  That's such an English word.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.508
Hmm.

36:19.611 --> 36:23.914
I've never been comfortable
     with the word "love."

36:24.983 --> 36:27.751
Not even with my wife.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.389
Roy.

36:32.658 --> 36:36.193
You just opened up to me.

36:37.996 --> 36:41.831
Well, we should do something
     to mark the occasion,

36:42.367 --> 36:44.768
but you've already
        turned me down.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.770
[both laughing]

36:47.606 --> 36:50.674
Look, if you would like me
      to say "I love you,"

36:50.676 --> 36:53.710
I'll certainly have
          a go at it.

36:55.247 --> 36:58.348
When the time comes.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.331
[gasps]

37:15.267 --> 37:16.800
[shouting] Roy!

37:18.403 --> 37:19.336
Roy!

37:19.338 --> 37:20.904
[Roy] Betty!

37:20.906 --> 37:22.806
What is it?

37:22.808 --> 37:24.007
[Betty] There was a man.

37:24.009 --> 37:26.509
[Roy] Hang on. Okay.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.303
Somebody tried to break in
          last night.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.271
Do you know who?

37:54.273 --> 37:56.906
There's a cunt
    in a silver fucking Audi
      keeps coming around.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.009
It could've been him,

37:59.978 --> 38:02.078
but I can't work out why.

38:02.080 --> 38:04.381
Should we put it off?

38:05.517 --> 38:06.383
No, no.

38:06.385 --> 38:09.452
She'll be back from
   the hairdresser's at 1:00.

38:09.454 --> 38:12.455
So, Roy's had a doubling
       of his investment.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.592
It's what we like to call
         a "windfall."

38:15.594 --> 38:17.694
How often
    do these windfalls come?

38:17.696 --> 38:20.330
Oh, once or twice a year.

38:20.332 --> 38:22.565
Oh, my God!

38:23.135 --> 38:24.467
£20,000?

38:24.469 --> 38:26.136
That's like winning
         the lottery.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.272
[Roy] Investing with Vincent
   is like winning the lottery

38:29.274 --> 38:30.740
and Royal Ascot.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.609
Given the size
        of your estate,

38:32.611 --> 38:34.944
there'd be a windfall
          every week.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.880
So, what would you...

38:36.882 --> 38:37.881
-Mmm?
        -[Roy] Stephen?

38:37.883 --> 38:40.183
I thought you were in Spandau.

38:40.185 --> 38:42.152
[Stephen] Oh, did you?

38:42.154 --> 38:43.753
Well, they let me out early.

38:43.755 --> 38:44.821
[Betty] Oh, Stephen.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.624
Why didn't you let me know
         you were back?

38:47.626 --> 38:48.892
You should have called.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.160
What have you got her doing?

38:50.162 --> 38:52.162
So, he moves in here
       with his gammy leg,

38:52.164 --> 38:53.763
and the first time
  I leave you alone with him,

38:53.765 --> 38:55.932
he's got you giving him
        all your money.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.233
-No!
      -[Roy] No, no, no...

38:57.235 --> 38:58.601
[Betty] That's not what's
        going on here!

38:58.603 --> 39:00.503
That's jumping a few fences.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.640
Listen, Roy,
       do you know what?

39:03.642 --> 39:04.774
This isn't your house.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.143
-Stephen!
       -He's an intruder.

39:07.145 --> 39:08.211
Can you see that?

39:08.213 --> 39:10.947
You're embarrassing me
    in front of Mr. Halloran

39:10.949 --> 39:13.249
and Roy who I...

39:13.251 --> 39:14.417
Look, I'm sorry...

39:14.419 --> 39:16.619
Don't touch me.

39:19.257 --> 39:21.024
[Betty sniffles]

39:21.693 --> 39:24.828
Mr. Halloran, I am very sorry.

39:29.768 --> 39:33.236
Stephen, I know my appearance
         on the scene

39:33.238 --> 39:36.306
has altered your relationship
    with your grandmother,

39:36.308 --> 39:41.945
but I do have an advantage
           over you.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.046
My age.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.416
I'm of your
      grandmother's time.

39:46.418 --> 39:49.753
The world we grew up in,
       the world we knew.

39:50.389 --> 39:53.523
And not being
    a member of the family,

39:53.525 --> 39:54.791
there's an added compensation

39:54.793 --> 39:58.795
which you might call
    a romantic possibility.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.731
If Betty gains by something

40:01.733 --> 40:05.201
that you couldn't possibly
           give her,

40:05.203 --> 40:07.137
good for her.

40:07.139 --> 40:10.407
God knows it's good for me.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.616
Sorry.

40:21.119 --> 40:21.885
Listen, my dear,

40:21.887 --> 40:24.587
what if you gave the windfall
          to Stephen?

40:24.589 --> 40:26.289
£20,000, it'd be far too much.

40:26.291 --> 40:27.590
He wouldn't know
        how to spend it.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.560
-[indistinct chattering]
     -[piano playing softly]

40:32.364 --> 40:33.163
Then half.

40:33.165 --> 40:37.700
10,000 for Stephen,
        10,000 for us.

40:40.172 --> 40:40.970
Us?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.238
That trip you mentioned.

40:42.240 --> 40:46.576
The one you were planning
     before Alasdair died.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.445
[sighs]

40:49.014 --> 40:51.014
Oh, Roy.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.186
You are the kindest person.

41:00.025 --> 41:01.157
[glasses clink]

41:01.159 --> 41:02.225
[Roy] My own Delilah.

41:02.227 --> 41:03.893
Can't have you going
           on holiday

41:03.895 --> 41:05.962
with all these shaggy bits.

41:05.964 --> 41:07.697
So, where do you think
         we should go?

41:07.699 --> 41:11.034
Alasdair and I were planning
   on going to Paris, Venice,

41:11.036 --> 41:12.168
and then Berlin.

41:12.170 --> 41:14.204
Oh, Berlin.

41:14.206 --> 41:15.271
It's all so gray.

41:15.273 --> 41:18.308
No, no. It's the most exciting
  city in Europe at the moment.

41:18.310 --> 41:20.777
Oh, yes.
    Incredible architecture.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.446
And the restaurants,
        and the history.

41:23.448 --> 41:26.916
Suppose we went
   the warm and sunny route?

41:26.918 --> 41:29.519
Like Costa del Sol,

41:29.521 --> 41:31.855
or some Greek island.

41:33.024 --> 41:35.258
What would you think of that?

41:35.260 --> 41:37.026
[Betty groans softly]

41:37.295 --> 41:38.461
Betty?

41:38.463 --> 41:39.395
[exhales]

41:39.397 --> 41:42.198
Betty, are you all right?
    I'll call an ambulance.

41:42.200 --> 41:42.999
[Betty] No.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.134
No, no, no. Call my doctor.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.871
His number's
      on the noticeboard.

41:58.683 --> 41:59.716
[Dr. Livesey clears throat]

41:59.718 --> 42:02.018
Likely you've had
        another stroke.

42:02.020 --> 42:02.886
Oh, good Lord!

42:02.888 --> 42:04.354
Oh, I've had them before.

42:04.356 --> 42:06.155
Very small, very tiny,

42:06.157 --> 42:07.924
little minor strokes.

42:07.926 --> 42:08.791
[Dr. Livesey] Yes.

42:08.793 --> 42:11.628
And the more you have,
    the more damage they do.

42:11.630 --> 42:14.931
Have you been taking
    the pills I prescribed?

42:16.434 --> 42:17.834
No.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.802
There must be some treatment.

42:19.804 --> 42:22.839
Yes. Bedrest. Surgery.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.040
Reducing the tensions

42:24.042 --> 42:26.042
and activities
       of my life till--

42:26.044 --> 42:27.110
Mrs. McLeish.

42:27.112 --> 42:28.144
I'm not gonna do it, Doctor.

42:28.146 --> 42:31.948
I'm not gonna live
    as if I'm already dead.

42:31.950 --> 42:35.952
And if you don't,
  you won't live out the year.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.427
[Roy] One, two, three.

42:44.429 --> 42:45.895
[Roy counting in French]

42:45.897 --> 42:47.931
[Roy counting in Spanish]

42:48.533 --> 42:49.933
[sighs]

42:51.069 --> 42:52.969
Are you all right?

42:54.406 --> 42:57.340
When I saw you
        on the floor...

42:59.477 --> 43:00.376
I mean, just a blink

43:00.378 --> 43:03.079
and your life's
        changed forever.

43:04.583 --> 43:05.715
You win.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.517
Paris, Venice...

43:07.519 --> 43:09.719
<i> Und</i> Berlin.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.722
Berlin?

43:12.824 --> 43:14.624
Good.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.166
Here you are, sir.

43:33.345 --> 43:34.811
[Betty] No.

43:34.813 --> 43:36.245
Um...

43:36.247 --> 43:37.647
Mmm.

43:40.719 --> 43:42.118
Ah.

43:43.154 --> 43:45.788
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

43:45.790 --> 43:49.192
And that umbrella looks as
 though it's seen better days.

43:49.194 --> 43:50.627
That's seen me through
            the war.

43:50.629 --> 43:53.429
Yes. On the losing side,
      by the looks of it.

43:53.431 --> 43:55.064
[Roy chuckling]

44:01.906 --> 44:03.306
Perfect.

44:04.843 --> 44:08.044
-Thank you very much indeed.
      -[Betty] Thank you.

44:09.948 --> 44:11.447
It looks very good.

44:11.449 --> 44:12.315
Yeah.

44:12.317 --> 44:16.886
[Betty] Now, I'm going
       to show you a pair
        of walking shoes

44:16.888 --> 44:18.821
that I'm absolutely craving.

44:18.823 --> 44:21.491
They're right here.
        There they are.

44:21.493 --> 44:23.026
Aren't they beautiful?

44:23.028 --> 44:25.361
I've had my eye on them
           for ages.

44:25.363 --> 44:27.397
But they're very expensive.

44:27.999 --> 44:28.798
What do you think?

44:28.800 --> 44:32.769
Look, why don't you go in
      and treat yourself?

44:32.771 --> 44:35.872
And I'll meet you at Fortnum's
          in an hour.

44:35.874 --> 44:36.773
For tea.

44:36.775 --> 44:39.942
-Do you know, I think I will.
           -Come on.

44:39.944 --> 44:43.846
-[Betty] In an hour. Fortnum's.
       -Yes. Fortnum's.

45:14.312 --> 45:16.079
[Roy] Excuse me!

45:16.748 --> 45:18.314
Excuse me!

45:18.316 --> 45:20.850
[woman over PA]
    <i> This is Charing Cross.</i>

45:20.852 --> 45:23.019
<i> This is</i>
    <i> the Bakerloo Line train</i>

45:23.021 --> 45:25.054
<i> to Elephant and Castle.</i>

45:26.491 --> 45:28.124
[man over PA] <i> Mind the gap.</i>

45:28.126 --> 45:32.061
<i> Stand clear</i>
     <i> of the doors, please.</i>

45:35.633 --> 45:37.200
[train whizzing]

45:42.307 --> 45:45.374
That was a good one
       you pulled, Roy!

45:46.277 --> 45:47.176
The other bloke was all,

45:47.178 --> 45:50.446
"Oh, don't make a fuss.
       It's only money."

45:50.915 --> 45:52.048
Then it hit me.

45:52.050 --> 45:53.783
If the Russians were wired,

45:53.785 --> 45:58.221
why didn't the police nick us
     at the first meeting?

45:58.223 --> 46:01.824
We committed fraud.
       Pure and simple.

46:01.826 --> 46:06.562
The second meeting was
 so you could double the take.

46:06.564 --> 46:08.164
Greedy old Roy.

46:08.166 --> 46:10.633
[Roy] What do you expect me
            to do?

46:10.635 --> 46:12.702
Give me back
        my 100,000 quid.

46:12.704 --> 46:14.070
I don't have it.

46:14.072 --> 46:14.971
Get it!

46:14.973 --> 46:17.940
Or I'll tell the old bitch
    you're shacked up with.

46:17.942 --> 46:22.545
I'm gonna break something
 other than a bloody flowerpot.

46:23.348 --> 46:24.881
So that was you?

46:26.651 --> 46:27.817
Clever Bryn.

46:27.819 --> 46:29.385
[Bryn groans]

46:29.654 --> 46:31.521
[Bryn screaming]

46:33.691 --> 46:34.757
[train screeching]

46:34.759 --> 46:36.993
[people screaming]

46:38.062 --> 46:40.062
-[woman] Help, help!
          -[Man] Help!

46:40.064 --> 46:41.831
Help!

46:42.100 --> 46:46.269
[woman] Please, an ambulance!
     We need an ambulance!

46:48.306 --> 46:49.572
[busker] Thank you.

46:49.574 --> 46:51.307
God bless you.

46:52.277 --> 46:53.910
[exhales]

46:59.250 --> 47:01.617
[male police officer]
    Out of the way, please.

47:01.619 --> 47:02.652
Out of the way!

47:02.654 --> 47:04.086
[female police officer]
      Step aside, please.

47:04.088 --> 47:05.354
[male police officer]
        Out of the way.

47:05.356 --> 47:06.923
Gentleman at Charing Cross.
          Responding.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.257
Watch out!
    Out of the way, please.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.359
[male police officer]
         To one side.

47:11.596 --> 47:13.329
[siren blaring]

47:15.733 --> 47:17.900
[indistinct chattering]

47:18.670 --> 47:20.436
Oh, there you are.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.306
New raincoat?

47:23.308 --> 47:26.175
Well, it seemed
       necessary somehow.

47:26.511 --> 47:28.010
Shall we?

47:29.814 --> 47:32.215
I think we should move up
          our flight.

47:32.217 --> 47:33.049
-What?
              -Yes.

47:33.051 --> 47:35.184
I've got a sudden urge
           to leave.

47:35.186 --> 47:36.452
Let's go tomorrow.

47:36.454 --> 47:37.987
[Betty] Why not?

47:43.361 --> 47:44.994
Thank you.

47:53.137 --> 47:56.639
Alasdair was here
     at the end of the war.

47:57.275 --> 48:00.243
He was always talking about
     the Brandenburg Gate.

48:00.245 --> 48:03.312
What it stood for.
    How it was fought over.

48:03.314 --> 48:07.083
And you wish he were here
     to share it with you.

48:07.085 --> 48:08.584
Don't you?

48:08.987 --> 48:10.052
Yes.

48:10.054 --> 48:13.923
But if he were,
  I wouldn't be here with you.

48:14.025 --> 48:15.825
All right.

48:15.827 --> 48:17.260
Stephen!

48:18.429 --> 48:19.562
Hey. I made it.

48:19.564 --> 48:21.097
Hello. You did.

48:21.666 --> 48:22.732
[Betty chuckles]

48:22.734 --> 48:24.467
What are you doing here?

48:24.469 --> 48:25.735
We thought we'd surprise you.

48:25.737 --> 48:29.639
Yeah. I wanted to apologize
  for being an absolute shit.

48:29.641 --> 48:32.341
You don't know Berlin,
           but I do.

48:32.343 --> 48:35.945
-[sighs]
 -So, what's first on the list?

48:35.947 --> 48:38.648
Well, Brandenburg Gate.

48:38.650 --> 48:40.082
Yeah.

48:49.260 --> 48:51.527
[Betty] All that power.

48:51.529 --> 48:53.162
[Roy] Yeah.

48:53.698 --> 48:55.998
[Betty] All that confidence.

48:56.000 --> 48:57.667
[Roy] Mmm.

48:59.504 --> 49:02.004
Little did they know.

49:02.240 --> 49:05.241
[Stephen speaking German]

49:07.211 --> 49:08.978
True.

49:10.848 --> 49:13.015
You speak German?

49:15.820 --> 49:17.286
Sorry?

49:18.256 --> 49:20.356
I wasn't really listening.

49:20.358 --> 49:21.657
Will you say that again?

49:21.659 --> 49:25.261
When they burn books,
          in the end,

49:25.263 --> 49:26.963
they also burn people.

49:26.965 --> 49:28.698
[Roy] Yeah.

49:30.401 --> 49:34.637
Not exactly what I was hoping
      to hear on holiday.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.339
[chuckling]

49:41.346 --> 49:43.446
[indistinct chatter]

49:43.448 --> 49:47.350
I didn't expect there'd be
    quite so many balloons.

49:47.352 --> 49:49.018
Looks like Disney runs it.

49:49.020 --> 49:51.587
Still, preferable
       to being shot at.

49:51.589 --> 49:53.689
Well, I wouldn't mind
        shooting a few.

49:53.691 --> 49:55.124
I think someone's
        getting cranky.

49:55.126 --> 49:56.759
Why don't you go back
         to the hotel?

49:56.761 --> 49:58.327
Would you mind taking him?

49:58.329 --> 49:59.762
I think I'm gonna
         go exploring.

49:59.764 --> 50:02.498
Doctor said you weren't
   to push yourself too far.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.667
Well, the doctor
         can bugger off.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.569
[Roy chuckles] Oh.

50:07.238 --> 50:09.071
[Stephen] Do you know
   how many people were shot

50:09.073 --> 50:10.506
trying to escape
         over the wall?

50:10.508 --> 50:12.174
No, Stephen. I don't.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.411
I suppose
    you're about to tell me.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.358
[sighs deeply]

50:32.130 --> 50:33.662
[door opens]

50:46.611 --> 50:48.511
Hello?

50:48.513 --> 50:50.546
Went the day well?

50:50.548 --> 50:51.414
What happened?

50:51.416 --> 50:53.049
Oh, it's just,
        I took a tumble.

50:53.051 --> 50:55.251
I tripped on a paving stone.
            [winces]

50:55.253 --> 50:57.119
Oh! Let me clean those hands.

50:57.121 --> 50:59.722
No, no, no. I can handle it.
           It's fine.

50:59.724 --> 51:01.724
No. You can sit down.

51:01.726 --> 51:02.725
[Betty breathing heavily]

51:02.727 --> 51:04.393
[Roy] Oh, you're huffing
          and puffing.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.630
Your heart's
     going a mile a minute.

51:09.200 --> 51:11.100
Now, come on.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.202
It has to be done.

51:16.140 --> 51:17.840
[Roy sighs]

51:21.412 --> 51:24.246
-Ooh. Hmm?
        -[grunts softly]

51:26.050 --> 51:27.616
[exhales] oh.

51:28.252 --> 51:30.252
-Was it one of your spells?
             -No.

51:30.254 --> 51:34.090
One minute I was up,
  the next minute I was down.

51:34.358 --> 51:36.625
It's this place.
    There's so much history.

51:36.627 --> 51:39.728
Everything is built
       on a heroic scale

51:39.730 --> 51:42.331
that makes you
     feel powerless and...

51:43.501 --> 51:45.134
There we are.

51:45.136 --> 51:47.203
All done.

51:49.740 --> 51:52.608
Roy's made it all better.

51:56.180 --> 51:57.313
Hey, hey. Sorry.

51:57.315 --> 52:00.049
[Betty] Have you got
     the address, Stephen?

52:00.051 --> 52:00.616
Uh, yes.

52:00.618 --> 52:02.551
But first,
     a stop along the way.

52:02.553 --> 52:04.120
The restaurant's
         booked at 8:00.

52:04.122 --> 52:06.856
Yeah, trust me,
      it will be worth it.

52:06.858 --> 52:09.492
[speaking German]

52:09.694 --> 52:11.760
[driver speaking German]

52:21.005 --> 52:23.372
[Roy sighs heavily]

52:36.454 --> 52:38.120
What is this place?

52:38.122 --> 52:40.289
Humor me.

53:08.252 --> 53:12.688
The owner's allowed us
       use of this flat.

53:14.759 --> 53:16.525
[Roy exhales]

53:18.796 --> 53:20.596
[door unlocking]

53:48.693 --> 53:50.359
It's changed a bit.

53:52.063 --> 53:52.828
Hmm?

53:52.830 --> 53:55.864
Since you were
        last here, Roy.

53:55.866 --> 53:57.299
Stephen, what are you doing?

53:57.301 --> 54:00.703
[Stephen] I accessed
      his service records.

54:01.405 --> 54:02.571
Roy Courtnay.

54:02.573 --> 54:06.408
Born Dorset. Only child.
        Father a vicar.

54:06.410 --> 54:09.345
Lieutenant British Army
         of the Rhine.

54:09.347 --> 54:12.548
Wounded. Berlin.
        At this address.

54:12.550 --> 54:15.851
Well, yes. Roy told us
   he was wounded in the war.

54:15.853 --> 54:20.589
Yes, but this was three years
        after the war.

54:21.525 --> 54:23.525
And it involved a murder.

54:23.527 --> 54:25.561
See, at that time,
   Berlin was cut into zones.

54:25.563 --> 54:27.496
American, French,
       Russian, British.

54:27.498 --> 54:28.998
Lieutenant Roy Courtnay
         was assigned

54:29.000 --> 54:31.267
to something called
          V Section,

54:31.269 --> 54:32.401
headquartered here.

54:32.403 --> 54:34.336
Oh, Stephen,
      I must correct you.

54:34.338 --> 54:37.573
V Section was not
    headquartered in Berlin,

54:37.575 --> 54:39.074
it was a division
        of intelligence,

54:39.076 --> 54:41.877
based in Hanover,
 reporting directly to London.

54:41.879 --> 54:46.982
We were in the business
       of hunting Nazis.

54:47.885 --> 54:48.817
V Section had got wind

54:48.819 --> 54:51.353
that there was a man
     hiding out in Berlin.

54:51.355 --> 54:53.322
Martin Geiger.

54:53.324 --> 54:55.557
Not a trivial catch.

54:55.559 --> 55:00.362
No. He'd been an administrator
       at Bergen-Belsen.

55:06.070 --> 55:08.370
<i> So, I was driven</i>
     <i> into the Soviet Zone</i>

55:08.372 --> 55:12.074
<i> by my German translator,</i>
          <i> Hans Taub.</i>

55:12.076 --> 55:14.543
[soldiers speaking German]

55:14.845 --> 55:17.546
<i> It was my first time</i>
          <i> in Berlin.</i>

55:17.548 --> 55:21.417
<i> But Taub, Taub had come home.</i>

55:21.419 --> 55:24.653
[young Roy] Must be strange
   coming back to all this.

55:24.655 --> 55:26.422
I hate this city.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.924
People who lived here
    deserved what they got.

55:28.926 --> 55:30.125
But surely your family...

55:30.127 --> 55:33.862
My father died before the war.
      The rest soon after.

55:34.932 --> 55:36.665
I have no family.

55:38.336 --> 55:40.102
[car honking]

55:44.175 --> 55:46.408
[Roy] <i> Taub was a lost soul.</i>

55:46.410 --> 55:50.779
<i> The war had left him old</i>
       <i> before his time.</i>

55:52.116 --> 55:52.881
Once we finish,

55:52.883 --> 55:56.185
find a nice bar,
   chat up a couple of girls.

55:56.187 --> 55:57.753
What do you think?

55:57.755 --> 55:59.755
Better to pay for one.

56:00.358 --> 56:03.692
The price these days
        is not so much.

56:07.465 --> 56:09.298
[Roy] <i> And to arrest Geiger,</i>

56:09.300 --> 56:11.734
<i> we needed</i>
    <i> the Soviets' approval.</i>

56:11.736 --> 56:13.669
<i> We had to wear</i>
       <i> civilian clothes.</i>

56:13.671 --> 56:16.939
<i> No dogtags.</i>
    <i> Nothing to identify us.</i>

56:17.641 --> 56:22.144
<i> Geiger was staying</i>
  <i> with a friend, Franz Konig.</i>

56:22.146 --> 56:24.446
Here. You're right.

56:24.448 --> 56:26.448
In this flat.

56:26.450 --> 56:28.550
<i> The plan was that</i>
      <i> we would come here</i>

56:28.552 --> 56:30.119
<i> while Geiger was at work,</i>

56:30.121 --> 56:34.256
<i> say that we were German police</i>
      <i> and wait for him.</i>

56:34.258 --> 56:35.924
[baby crying]

56:36.427 --> 56:38.660
<i> A routine lift.</i>

56:39.530 --> 56:40.429
[doorbell rings]

56:40.431 --> 56:44.833
<i> Except that the war</i>
<i> hadn't really ended in Berlin.</i>

56:45.970 --> 56:46.969
Make the smallest mistake

56:46.971 --> 56:51.473
and you could end up
       in enemy territory.

56:51.475 --> 56:57.479
I didn't speak German,
 so I left the talking to Taub.

56:57.982 --> 57:00.616

57:12.563 --> 57:14.096

[Roy in English]
  <i> Taub did the heavy lifting.</i>

57:24.642 --> 57:28.477
<i> All I had to do</i>
<i> was keep my bloody mouth shut.</i>

57:28.479 --> 57:30.846
[German song

58:58.335 --> 58:59.468
Geiger.

58:59.470 --> 59:01.103
Come in.

59:09.313 --> 59:11.113
Put the gun down.

59:12.349 --> 59:13.982
[Hans] Just leave.

59:14.218 --> 59:15.017
Gun!

59:15.019 --> 59:17.653
[Hans breathing heavily,
            winces]

59:17.755 --> 59:19.655
Okay. All right.

59:29.500 --> 59:31.700
[Hans grunts]

-[gunshot]
    -[shell casing clatters]

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.074
Hans Taub was killed.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:15.811
Geiger got away.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:18.347
[Stephen] Actually, no.

01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:23.418
Martin Geiger
   was caught two weeks later

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.187
by a Soviet patrol.

01:00:25.189 --> 01:00:31.760
His confession was very clear
  about what had taken place.

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:34.830
Who was dead.

01:00:36.367 --> 01:00:39.034
And who wasn't.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.378
It all happened so quickly.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:51.079
[young Roy grunting]

01:00:52.683 --> 01:00:54.883

[Roy] <i> When I opened my eyes,</i>
    <i> I saw him lying there.</i>

<i> Courtnay. Roy Courtnay.</i>

<i> His face shot off.</i>

[sighs] <i> I don't know</i>
      <i> how long it took me</i>
        <i> to work it out.</i>

01:01:24.548 --> 01:01:27.082
<i> Nothing could bring</i>
       <i> Roy Courtnay back.</i>

01:01:27.084 --> 01:01:30.719
<i> His family would never</i>
    <i> set eyes on him again.</i>

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.889
But Taub, his...

01:01:35.893 --> 01:01:38.060
My family,

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.295
they were all dead.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:42.431
No one was waiting.

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:45.467
No one would mourn.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.737
<i> Becoming an Englishman</i>
    <i> wouldn't be difficult.</i>

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:52.541
<i> I'd been teaching the language</i>

01:01:52.543 --> 01:01:53.642
<i> At headquarters,</i>

01:01:53.644 --> 01:01:55.544
<i> people had often remarked</i>
      <i> on the resemblance</i>

<i> between Lieutenant Courtnay</i>
            <i> and me.</i>

01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:03.885
<i> This was my chance</i>
         <i> to get out.</i>

01:02:03.887 --> 01:02:05.020
<i> To leave behind the country</i>

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:08.123
<i> that had given me</i>
     <i> a lifetime of misery.</i>

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:12.694
<i> I could start over.</i>

01:02:12.696 --> 01:02:16.298
<i> Be on the winning side</i>
          <i> for once.</i>

01:02:17.968 --> 01:02:20.268
I crossed into
       the British Zone,

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.037
talked my way
     onto a transport plane

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:25.874
and I was in England
        by next morning.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:30.612
I typed a letter
        to the reverend
    and Mrs. J. L. Courtnay

01:02:30.614 --> 01:02:32.881
on their son's Remington

01:02:32.883 --> 01:02:36.118
informing them
 that my experiences in Germany

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.053
had changed me irrevocably.

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:41.056
That I saw
 a different future for myself,

01:02:41.058 --> 01:02:43.925
and that as my decision
          was final,

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:48.096
a clean break
     was the best solution.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:52.200
All expressed kindly,
          rationally.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:55.837
With love.

01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:00.142
When that was over,

01:03:00.144 --> 01:03:05.213
I changed my name
        to Roy Manning

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:08.683
and I waited for them to die.

01:03:08.685 --> 01:03:13.922
Yes. And when they did,
    Roy Courtnay reemerged.

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:16.258
May I ask,

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:20.595
what it is you hope
  to accomplish with all this?

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:21.730
Justice.

01:03:21.732 --> 01:03:23.999
A man named Hans Taub,
         presumed dead,

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:26.001
has been roaming the earth
         for 60 years,

01:03:26.003 --> 01:03:30.005
not having paid the price for
  a single crime he committed!

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:34.109
Hans Taub wasn't
         a war criminal.

01:03:34.111 --> 01:03:35.110
He was conscripted.

01:03:35.112 --> 01:03:37.479
He served in the infantry,
          both fronts!

01:03:37.481 --> 01:03:41.216
Oh, you think you've caught
  yourself a Nazi, don't you?

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:43.652
Well, have you looked
      in the <i> Dienststelle?</i>

01:03:43.654 --> 01:03:45.854
The personnel files,
      the military trials?

01:03:45.856 --> 01:03:46.688
Yes.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.990
And did you see anything there
   that implicated Hans Taub?

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.827
-No.
      -The Russian files?

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:52.994
Anything there?

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:55.664
Well, not that
        I can find. No.

01:03:55.666 --> 01:03:57.299
Nothing then.

01:03:58.268 --> 01:04:00.235
For the last half century,

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:01.837
I have lived as honestly

01:04:01.839 --> 01:04:03.338
and as decently
       as any Englishman.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:04.940
Honestly? You may not be
        a war criminal,

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.708
but there are plenty
       of other crimes...

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:08.243
Stephen, enough!

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:09.644
[Roy groans softly]

01:04:09.646 --> 01:04:11.513
You assume it's necessary
    to save your grandmother

01:04:11.515 --> 01:04:13.481
from all sorts
     of imaginary dangers.

01:04:13.483 --> 01:04:15.684
Look, you don't know him!

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.953
I make my own choices.

01:04:17.955 --> 01:04:19.154
And I don't need
        your permission.

01:04:19.156 --> 01:04:21.323
If you can't respect that,
 then I think it's just as well

01:04:21.325 --> 01:04:25.026
that we don't
  see each other for a while.

01:04:34.738 --> 01:04:37.439
Obviously, I'm intruding.

01:04:47.718 --> 01:04:49.184
[door slams]

01:04:49.186 --> 01:04:50.919
Mmm.

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:54.356
Do you know who you are?

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:00.462
You're the only person
         on this planet

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:03.965
who makes me feel
      that I'm not alone.

01:05:05.903 --> 01:05:08.036
[chuckles softly]

01:05:08.038 --> 01:05:11.640
Oh, to hell with
       Venice and Paris,

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:14.542
let's go home.

01:05:25.188 --> 01:05:27.088
-Oh.
        -[Roy chuckles]

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.556
Glad to be home.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:30.258
Oh, yes.

01:05:30.894 --> 01:05:32.394
Roy.

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:35.297
-Why don't you call Vincent?
             -What?

01:05:35.299 --> 01:05:38.533
Let's go forward
    with the joint account.

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:44.105
-Are you sure?
             -Yes.

01:05:46.843 --> 01:05:48.643
[exhales]

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:04.492
So, we're going
        to do the usual?

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:09.998
I transfer my funds,
       she transfers hers,

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.169
and then I suck the money
      out of the account.

01:06:14.171 --> 01:06:15.837
You're gonna take the lot?

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:18.873
It's nearly £3,000,000.

01:06:18.875 --> 01:06:20.108
After a lifetime of effort,

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:25.246
where a good score is 100,000
     split too many ways,

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:29.017
yeah, you bloody bet
     I'm gonna take it all.

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:32.387
It's what we like to call
    a windfall. [chuckles]

01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:33.321
Oh, it wouldn't hurt

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.323
to leave her a bit though,
           would it?

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.825
When I'm running down
           the hill,

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:38.159
I don't want to
         have to depend

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.661
on the fucking
    National Health Service.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.196
I plan on having enough money

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:44.032
to just sit on a beach,
      sipping champagne.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:47.135
Is that why you think
   you do it? For the money?

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:51.039
[scoffs] It's the game.
   It's the adrenaline rush.

01:06:51.041 --> 01:06:52.273
What if it is?

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:54.175
You get just as big a jolt

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.745
if you left her
    a little bit to live on.

01:06:56.747 --> 01:06:58.747
What am I now, a charity?

01:06:58.749 --> 01:06:59.381
No.

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:03.284
But, this one,
  she's pretty ill, isn't she?

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:05.820
Well, do you think
       I don't know that?

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:09.324
And who do you think's
      been caring for her?

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.392
I see to it that she gets

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:11.793
the right pills
       at the right time.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:15.063
I make certain
 she's in bed at a decent hour.

01:07:15.065 --> 01:07:18.033
No refined sugar, no caffeine.
      No talk of politics

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:20.101
or her bloody blood pressure
     goes through the roof!

01:07:20.103 --> 01:07:23.538
I don't need you to tell me
     that she's ill for...

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.341
[exhales sharply]

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:30.078
You don't wanna do this, Roy.

01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:32.380
Don't I?

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:36.151
[sighs softly]

01:07:37.854 --> 01:07:39.621
[sighs]

01:07:40.323 --> 01:07:44.659
Don't tell me
       what I want, Vin.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:48.396
I'll do what I do.

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:50.665
If your feet
       are getting cold--

01:07:50.667 --> 01:07:52.067
No.

01:07:52.202 --> 01:07:53.735
Mmm-mmm.

01:07:59.376 --> 01:08:00.608
I'm in.

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:01.276
Good.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:07.148
I'll just close up here and
 then it's onto the next flat.

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.685
And the next Roy.

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.490
[Roy grunts]

01:08:41.651 --> 01:08:43.283
[Roy sighs]

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.185
Are you having
        second thoughts?

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:48.223
No. Not a bit.

01:08:55.599 --> 01:08:57.999
To the matter
      of the joint trust.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:08:59.100
Are you both agreed

01:08:59.102 --> 01:09:02.569
to the combining
   of your individual assets?

01:09:03.707 --> 01:09:05.140
I am.

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:05.807
I am.

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:09.844
Please, sign here.
         Here and here.

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:11.746
Both copies.

01:09:17.354 --> 01:09:19.187
[exhales]

01:09:25.295 --> 01:09:28.796
So, shall we effect
         the transfer?

01:09:29.032 --> 01:09:30.732
[inhales sharply]

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:31.832
Yes.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.402
The bank here is
        Hayes & Paulsen
       in the Caribbean,

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:38.439
and with these keypads,
     you can log into your
   joint account at any time

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:41.509
to see how well
  your investments are doing.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.979
Betty, will you please
      transfer your funds

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.282
into the joint account?

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.317
Uh...

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:51.185
Um...

01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:54.288
[stammers] I wonder, I mean,

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.457
is it wise
     to transfer all of it?

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:59.027
To take it
      right down to zero?

01:09:59.029 --> 01:10:04.299
I mean,
   wouldn't it be a good idea
     maybe to leave a bit?

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:07.669
That would be prudent,
          wouldn't it?

01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:15.710
True. It might be.

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:18.813
But, um, it's also true
   that the less one puts in,

01:10:18.815 --> 01:10:20.582
the less one gets in return.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:23.051
Ah, well, that is a point.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:24.719
[Betty] Mmm.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:27.622
It's just that...

01:10:28.091 --> 01:10:32.126
Well, I had a recent...

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.628
Um...

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.263
[Roy] Vincent...

01:10:35.265 --> 01:10:38.499
Betty has had some
     health issues of late.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.500
Nothing terribly serious,

01:10:39.502 --> 01:10:42.870
but it does make one think
   twice before taking a risk

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:45.673
even on such
       sound investments.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:51.746
Which is why I've been
   holding back a bit myself.

01:11:04.928 --> 01:11:06.794
1-7-1...

01:11:08.531 --> 01:11:11.966
7-7-6.

01:11:12.202 --> 01:11:14.702
I put in everything.

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.976
Everything.

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:27.649
You certainly have.

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.588
Ooh!

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:36.924
You've been hiding your light
    under a bushel as well.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:39.694
No, no. I said I was thrifty.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.497
[chuckles] And then some.

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.672
I'm all in, too.

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:56.844
Roy, will you now
      deposit your funds?

01:11:57.714 --> 01:11:59.347
[smacks lips] Um...

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.349
[both laugh]

01:12:04.254 --> 01:12:05.853
[Betty] Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:12:05.855 --> 01:12:08.122
So, now for security
        and so that only

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:10.224
you two have access
     to the joint account,

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:12.960
you need to create a passcode.

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.563
Um, six letters.

01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.599
Uh, some...

01:12:19.069 --> 01:12:20.735
What about that?

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:23.671
[Roy] Well, flowers?

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:26.674
No, that's seven letters,
       isn't it? It is.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.477
No, no. The kind of flowers.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.979
Oh, lilies! Oh.

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:34.282
Nice.

01:12:34.284 --> 01:12:35.883
[Vincent]
  Well, if that's your choice,

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:39.687
please type "lilies"
        into your pads.

01:12:41.491 --> 01:12:42.990
[typing]

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:47.095
I. L. L.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:50.865
-Done! Ha! Congratulations!
             -Yes.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.600
[Betty chuckles]

01:12:59.142 --> 01:13:00.475
[cell phone ringing]

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:02.643
I think we should celebrate
        with champagne.

01:13:02.645 --> 01:13:06.080
Well, I would,
  but I'm afraid I'm driving.

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:07.548
[Betty] Oh.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.883
Don't you want to get that?

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:12.186
What? Oh! No. Right.

01:13:12.188 --> 01:13:13.287
[Roy chuckles]

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:16.090
Vincent, thank you.

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:20.128
Thank you.

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:32.073
Until next time.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.297
-[cork pops]
        -[glass clinks]

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:57.932
[pouring drink]

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:04.806
What are we drinking to?

01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.941
What we must always
           drink to,

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.543
the future.

01:14:09.145 --> 01:14:09.911
The future.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.312
How should we spend
          the profits

01:14:11.314 --> 01:14:12.680
when they start to come in?

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:14.182
I thought maybe
    we could book a cruise,

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:16.551
or we could get one of those
    timeshares in Mallorca.

01:14:16.553 --> 01:14:17.718
Yes, we could.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:19.520
Anyway, we don't
      have to decide now.

01:14:19.522 --> 01:14:22.056
Oh, no, no, there's plenty
     of time for all that.

01:14:22.058 --> 01:14:23.591
The important thing is

01:14:23.593 --> 01:14:26.127
it's all packed away
         in one place,

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.662
where it's safe and sound.

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.063
-[chuckles]
           -Like us.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:31.199
Oh, hadn't you better
      check your mobile?

01:14:31.201 --> 01:14:33.067
-Hmm?
         -[Betty] Mmm.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:35.870
That call.
      Was there a message?

01:14:36.406 --> 01:14:38.372
Was there? I don't know.

01:14:38.374 --> 01:14:40.107
[keypad beeping]

01:14:42.345 --> 01:14:43.978
Mmm.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:47.248
-It's my son.
           -Robert?

01:14:47.250 --> 01:14:49.750
Yeah. He's in London.

01:14:53.223 --> 01:14:54.822
Had some kitchen show.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.624
He's flying away
      to Canada tomorrow,

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:59.460
wants to know would I
    like to see him tonight.

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:02.129
-Oh, you must!
              -No.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.467
We're not close.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:09.337
Roy, he's your son.
        I'll drive you.

01:15:09.339 --> 01:15:11.072
I'd love to meet Robert.

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:13.574
Oh, no, no.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.746
I'll take the train.

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.240
[sighs]

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.596
I doubt there's
       much chance of it,

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:12.099
but if we go to dinner
       and it gets late,

   you came all the way back.

Well, no reason
  to spend the night in town,

01:22:26.809 --> 01:22:29.143

     or leave you a message

01:33:05.814 --> 01:33:07.280
Lili...

01:33:07.716 --> 01:33:11.351
I never intended you any harm.

01:33:11.353 --> 01:33:13.286
When you denounced my father,

01:33:13.288 --> 01:33:15.055
what did you imagine
         would happen?

01:33:15.057 --> 01:33:16.489
Well, I suppose
      I should have known

01:33:16.491 --> 01:33:19.359
that your family would be
    in some kind of trouble.

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:22.662
How could I calculate
  these things? I was a child.

01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:23.697
You were 15!

01:33:23.699 --> 01:33:27.100
You knew exactly what
  you were doing, didn't you?

01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:29.302
Well, I suppose... [sighs]

01:33:29.304 --> 01:33:30.737
-Well, I don't know.
           -[clicks]

01:33:30.739 --> 01:33:33.707
Do not do that
         one more time.

01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:38.211
Your sisters humiliated me.
    Your father wronged me.

01:33:38.213 --> 01:33:41.348
I wanted to teach you
           a lesson.

01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:44.117
And there it is.

01:33:44.119 --> 01:33:44.851
Oh, Betty.

01:33:44.853 --> 01:33:47.287
Why did you go
      to all this trouble?

01:33:47.289 --> 01:33:48.321
Once you'd found me,

01:33:48.323 --> 01:33:49.956
you could have
       just talked to me.

01:33:49.958 --> 01:33:52.292
[scoffs] Well, I doubt
      whether I would have

01:33:52.294 --> 01:33:54.127
accomplished very much
         if I'd said...

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:55.862
"Hello, I'm Lili Schroder.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:58.565
"I'm the girl you raped
           in 1943."

01:33:58.567 --> 01:34:03.269
Talk to you, Roy? No.
  First I needed to study you.

01:34:04.106 --> 01:34:05.038
<i> Fortunately, Stephen</i>

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.507
<i> is an absolutely</i>
     <i> brilliant researcher.</i>

01:34:07.509 --> 01:34:11.578
<i>So it wasn't difficult for him</i>
<i>to track your criminal career.</i>

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:14.748
<i> You even appeared in</i>
  <i> the newspaper a few times,</i>

01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.783

<i> -you like to victimize.</i>
           -Estelle?

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.559
Well, you've had your fun.

01:34:26.561 --> 01:34:28.561
But so what? Hmm?

01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:31.164
There's nothing to connect me
          with Taub.

01:34:31.166 --> 01:34:32.632
Do you remember
     our last day in Berlin

01:34:32.634 --> 01:34:34.100
when I went exploring?

01:34:34.102 --> 01:34:36.002
When you fell.

01:34:36.571 --> 01:34:40.440
[Betty] <i> I went back</i>
     <i> to my family's house.</i>

01:34:40.976 --> 01:34:43.443

01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:03.363
<i> There was no reason</i>
      <i> to believe I'd find</i>

01:35:03.365 --> 01:35:06.099

<i> My silver locket</i>

01:36:33.455 --> 01:36:36.422

    I already had a sample.

01:36:42.264 --> 01:36:43.329
Oh, Betty,

01:36:43.331 --> 01:36:44.330
you know I could have kept

01:36:44.332 --> 01:36:46.399
going tonight,
        but I came back.

01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:48.968
You came back for this.

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.970
But I'd moved
      all of my money out

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:52.605
as soon as your train
       left the station.

01:36:52.607 --> 01:36:56.442
Vincent helped me with
 the very, um, technical bits.

01:36:56.444 --> 01:36:57.610
-Vincent?
             -Yes!

01:36:57.612 --> 01:37:01.381
<i> Stephen had a word with him</i>
   <i> before we left for Berlin.</i>

01:37:01.383 --> 01:37:02.682
<i> I think he put it to him</i>

01:37:02.684 --> 01:37:04.684
<i> that multiple charges</i>
          <i> of forgery,</i>

01:37:04.686 --> 01:37:05.785
fraud, and extortion

01:37:05.787 --> 01:37:07.687
were not the legacy
         he might want

01:37:07.689 --> 01:37:09.689
to leave his children.

01:37:09.691 --> 01:37:10.857
Did he try to warn you?

01:37:10.859 --> 01:37:12.826
We were rather afraid
        that he might.

01:37:12.828 --> 01:37:13.993
Oh, and by the way,

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:15.395
you know Stephen's
        not my grandson.

01:37:15.397 --> 01:37:16.696
I mean,
    I do have grandchildren,

01:37:16.698 --> 01:37:19.465
too many of them to count,
 but Stephen's not one of them.

01:37:19.467 --> 01:37:22.368
Oh, you did meet one
       actually. Michael.

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:24.838
You know, the chap
      in the silver Audi.

01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:28.141
<i> He's very protective</i>
         <i> of his gran.</i>

01:37:28.143 --> 01:37:29.275
Stephen's his partner.

01:37:29.277 --> 01:37:34.480
Yes, they were very helpful
     in setting the stage
     for our little play.

01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:38.151
<i> Every bland detail</i>
        <i> carefully chosen</i>

01:37:38.153 --> 01:37:41.454
<i> to lull you into</i>
    <i> a sense of complacency.</i>

01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:43.022
[Michael] There.

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:46.259
Boring Betty
      in her boring house.

01:37:46.261 --> 01:37:48.628
What an easy mark
         she'll make.

01:37:49.564 --> 01:37:51.598
Your strokes? That doctor.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.800
I suppose
    all that was a lie, too?

01:37:53.802 --> 01:37:56.769
Yes, of course.
     He's a friend of mine.

01:37:56.771 --> 01:37:57.971
We wanted to soften you up

01:37:57.973 --> 01:38:00.506
so you'd put all of your
     money into the account.

01:38:01.810 --> 01:38:03.710
And why,

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:06.346
after all these decades?

01:38:08.583 --> 01:38:10.550
Why do all this?

01:38:10.785 --> 01:38:12.452
Because for 60 years,

01:38:12.454 --> 01:38:15.154
I've been locked in that room
           with you.

01:38:15.156 --> 01:38:20.627
And the only way to free
     myself was to face you.

01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:23.029
Do you want me
      to ask forgiveness?

01:38:23.031 --> 01:38:26.065
I will. Yeah.

01:38:28.770 --> 01:38:30.837
I beg you.

01:38:30.839 --> 01:38:36.109
Oh, Roy. I forgave you
        a long time ago.

01:38:40.282 --> 01:38:43.182
I'm beyond you now.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.489
Tonight when I saw
       that I didn't have
      that bloody keypad,

01:38:49.491 --> 01:38:50.390
you know, I was elated.

01:38:50.392 --> 01:38:52.625
What I said at the station,
      I meant every word.

01:38:52.627 --> 01:38:54.961
And that's why I came back.

01:38:55.597 --> 01:38:57.664
I'm leaving you this.

01:38:58.433 --> 01:39:00.333
You may well need it.

01:39:00.335 --> 01:39:02.168
Where are you going?

01:39:02.170 --> 01:39:03.937
Home.

01:39:27.395 --> 01:39:30.630
There are people outside
  just waiting for me to call.

I don't have it.

I think you'll find he's got
   exactly what you're owed.

And if he says otherwise,

01:40:52.247 --> 01:40:54.480

It is so good to see you back

Yes, you prefer tea

 That's because you're English.

You know, any mistakes
    that I made in Berlin...

01:43:33.241 --> 01:43:34.974
were because...

Oh, I'll have one.
