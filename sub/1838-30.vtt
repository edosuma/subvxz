WEBVTT

00:06.367 --> 00:08.500
THANKS FOR WALKING ME
HOME TODAY, ANDRE.

00:08.500 --> 00:12.200
AND YESTERDAY AND, UM,
THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

00:12.200 --> 00:14.934
THAT'S A LOT
OF WALKING.
YEAH.

00:14.934 --> 00:15.867
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?

00:15.867 --> 00:18.734
YEAH, YEAH, I REALLY
THINK WE NEED TO
START TAKING THE BUS

00:18.734 --> 00:22.300
BECAUSE MY FEET ARE
GETTING SWOLLEN,
CRUSTY, AND BUMPY.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.967
HEH HEH HEH!

00:23.967 --> 00:26.700
I'M TALKING ABOUT
YOU BEING MY GIRLFRIEND.

00:26.700 --> 00:31.467
OH! OK, PLEASE
FORGET EVERYTHING
I SAID ABOUT MY FEET.

00:31.467 --> 00:35.700
UM, I'D LOVE TO BE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND, ANDRE.

00:35.700 --> 00:40.367
COOL. GREAT. SO...

00:41.033 --> 00:44.767
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
OK.

00:46.200 --> 00:48.934
[SQUEALS]

00:48.934 --> 00:51.200
BYE, BOYFRIEND!

00:51.200 --> 00:53.000
OH!

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
OW! MAN!

00:55.000 --> 00:57.567
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING HERE?!

00:57.567 --> 00:59.867
EAVESDROPPING.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.000
HOW MUCH DID YOU HEAR?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.133
NOTHING. EXCEPT THAT
YOU GOT A BOYFRIEND!

01:04.133 --> 01:06.900
I KNOW!
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND,
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!

01:06.900 --> 01:10.000
HEY, HEY, HE MIGHT BE
A WINNER. DON'T MESS
THIS UP, RAE.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.767
OK, I KNOW HE IS PERFECT.

01:12.767 --> 01:15.400
HE'S CUTE
AND KIND AND PERFECT

01:15.400 --> 01:19.734
AND SWEET AND FUNNY
AND PERFECT!

01:19.734 --> 01:23.100
DID I MENTION
HE WAS PERFECT?

01:23.100 --> 01:26.700
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.867
Rae: I CAN'T GO OUT
WITH SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.867
WE HAVE TO BREAK UP.

01:33.867 --> 01:36.600
OW!

01:36.934 --> 01:40.300
OH! OH, NO!
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:40.300 --> 01:42.700
ANDRE AND I ARE
GONNA BREAK UP,

01:42.700 --> 01:45.400
AND IT'S GONNA
HURT HIM REALLY BAD.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.600
OH. I GUESS
FOREVER'S

01:47.600 --> 01:50.133
NOT AS LONG
AS IT USED TO BE.

A BOYFRIEND?

02:48.700 --> 02:51.033
WELL, YOU ARE KIND OF
HIGH MAINTENANCE.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.300
AND YOU TEND
TO BE BOSSY.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.600
OH, DON'T FORGET NOSEY.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.233
EXCUSE ME! OK?

02:55.233 --> 02:57.467
IT JUST SO HAPPENS
THAT IN MY VISION

02:57.467 --> 02:59.834
I BROKE UP WITH ANDRE.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.100
SO THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.300
HEY! BUT MAYBE I CAN
FIND THE PROBLEM,

03:06.300 --> 03:08.600
FIX IT, AND THEN
WE WON'T BREAK UP.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.000
OH, YES. THE OLD FIND
AND FIX. GOOD PLAN, RAE.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.800
WHY DO GIRLS ALWAYS
THINK THEY CAN
FIX A GUY?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.600
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
FIX ME, BABY.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.100
I COME WITH
A LIFETIME GUARANTEE.

03:21.100 --> 03:23.767
UH, STANLEY, HOW'D
YOU GET IN MY HOUSE?

03:23.767 --> 03:26.200
HEY, DOORS CAN'T KEEP
MY LOVE OUT, BABY.

03:26.200 --> 03:31.100
ESPECIALLY SINCE I GOT
THIS NEW LOCK PICKING
KIT FOR CHRISTMAS.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.767
MM-HMM. OUT!

03:33.767 --> 03:34.800
OK, BABY.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.767
BUT MY LOVE IS LIKE
A BOOMERANG.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.500
IT KEEPS ON COMING BACK.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.767
WELL, MY FOOT IS LIKE
A PENDULUM. IT WILL
KEEP ON SWINGING!

03:41.767 --> 03:45.200
OK, I'M GOING.
THANK YOU.

03:49.133 --> 03:52.400
BOOMERANG, BABY.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.867
CORY, YOU'RE LATE.

03:58.867 --> 04:00.500
SORRY, DAD.
I WAS ON MY WAY HOME

04:00.500 --> 04:02.200
WHEN I PASSED BY
A CONSTRUCTION SITE,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.900
AND BAM!
SOMETHING HIT ME.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.500
WHAT? YOU GOT HIT?

04:06.500 --> 04:09.734
ARE YOU OK? WHAT HIT YOU?
A BRICK, A LOOSE BOARD?

04:09.734 --> 04:13.867
WE WILL SUE THEM
FOR EVERY PENNY
THEY'RE WORTH.

04:13.867 --> 04:17.300
DAD...I GOT HIT
BY AN IDEA.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.767
OH, WE CAN'T SUE
FOR THAT!

04:20.767 --> 04:22.200
WAS IT RUSTY?

04:22.200 --> 04:22.967
DAD, LISTEN TO ME.

04:22.967 --> 04:26.400
ALL THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS
WERE EATING FROM
BROWN PAPER BAGS

04:26.400 --> 04:28.767
AND LUNCHBOXES,
SO I WAS THINKING,

04:28.767 --> 04:31.200
WHAT IF A TRUCK PULLED UP
THAT SERVED QUALITY FOOD

04:31.200 --> 04:32.567
LIKE YOU DO
AT THE CHILL GRILL?

04:32.567 --> 04:34.500
THOSE WORKERS WOULD PAY
GOOD MONEY FOR THAT.

04:34.500 --> 04:36.767
YOU MEAN LIKE
A CATERING TRUCK?

04:36.767 --> 04:40.300
NOT JUST A CATERING
TRUCK, DAD.

04:40.300 --> 04:44.400
MORE LIKE
A CHILL GRILL ON WHEELS.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.934
OH, YEAH! YEAH, PEOPLE
LIKE TO EAT GOOD FOOD,

04:47.934 --> 04:50.734
AND THEY DON'T
ALWAYS WANT TO GO
TO A RESTAURANT.

04:50.734 --> 04:53.600
YEAH, THIS CITY IS
FILLED WITH HUNGRY,
LAZY PEOPLE.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.000
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.367
HEH! SO ARE
WE IN BUSINESS?

04:59.367 --> 05:03.200
LET'S DO IT, PARTNER.

05:04.400 --> 05:06.800
OK, I SAW ANDRE GO
INTO THIS CLASSROOM.

05:06.800 --> 05:10.133
I'M GONNA KEEP AN EYE
ON HIM AND SEE
WHAT HIS PROBLEM IS.

05:10.133 --> 05:13.233
GIVE ME A 7.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.300
7! THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT!

05:15.300 --> 05:16.734
SO THAT'S IT.

05:16.734 --> 05:19.200
ANDRE'S GOT
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

05:19.200 --> 05:24.000
NOTHING I CAN'T CURE.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.100
OK! BREAK IT UP,
YOU SICKOS!

05:27.100 --> 05:29.133
RAVEN?
ANDRE.

05:29.133 --> 05:31.567
YOU HAVE
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.033
NO, I DON'T.
YES, YOU DO.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.100
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE ARE GOING TO
GET YOU HELP. OK?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.233
AND I JUST
WANT YOU TO KNOW

05:36.233 --> 05:38.300
I WILL STAND BY YOU
NO MATTER WHAT.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.834
RAVEN, I'M NOT GAMBLING.
I'M A TUTOR.

05:41.834 --> 05:45.033
I'M DOING A MATH LESSON
ON PROBABILITY.

05:45.033 --> 05:45.734
PROBA-WHAT?

05:45.734 --> 05:48.834
PROBABILITY. YOU KNOW,
THE ODDS OF DIFFERENT
NUMBERS COMING UP

05:48.834 --> 05:53.467
WHEN YOU ROLL THE DICE.

05:53.467 --> 05:56.133
RIGHT! SO, UM,

05:56.133 --> 05:58.400
WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT YOU COULD, YOU KNOW,

05:58.400 --> 06:00.767
FORGET THIS EVER HAPPENED?

06:00.767 --> 06:02.967
HEY, RAVEN, YOU'RE
MY GIRLFRIEND.

06:02.967 --> 06:05.000
YOU CARE ABOUT ME.
IT'S OK.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.500
IT IS? OH, YOU ARE
SO PERFECT.

06:09.500 --> 06:13.000
OK, EVERYBODY,
CONTINUE ON.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.200
OH! SNAKE EYES!

06:18.900 --> 06:22.500
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I FEEL SO BAD
ABOUT THIS MORNING,

06:22.500 --> 06:24.934
THINKING THAT ANDRE HAS
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.

06:24.934 --> 06:26.233
BUT, RAE, YOU HAD
YOUR VISION.

06:26.233 --> 06:27.934
YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK UP WITH HIM
FOR SOMETHING.

06:27.934 --> 06:29.600
YEAH, MAYBE YOU OUGHT
TO CUT THE GUY

06:29.600 --> 06:31.000
A LITTLE BIT MORE SLACK
NEXT TIME, RAE.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.567
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN'T REALLY JUMP--

06:33.567 --> 06:36.100
OH! VANDALISM!

06:36.934 --> 06:39.300
RAE, YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
SPRAY-PAINTING THE WALL!

06:39.300 --> 06:42.300
SO THAT'S IT.
HE'S A TAGGER!

06:42.300 --> 06:43.300
OK, CALM DOWN. ALL RIGHT?

06:43.300 --> 06:47.100
THIS IS NOTHING
THAT WE CAN'T WORK
THROUGH TOGETHER.

06:48.300 --> 06:51.367
ANDRE, YOU COULD GET
IN SERIOUS TROUBLE
FOR GRAFFITI.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.934
LET ME FIX THIS--
HEY, RAVEN, STOP!

06:52.934 --> 06:55.734
YOU'LL RUIN MY MURAL!

06:55.734 --> 06:57.033
MURA-WHO?

06:57.033 --> 07:00.800
THE PRINCIPAL
ASKED ME TO CREATE
AN INSPIRATIONAL MURAL

07:00.800 --> 07:04.300
TO PROMOTE LEARNING
AND GOOD VALUES.

07:10.467 --> 07:14.000
AND, UM, I SUPPORT
THAT 100%.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.667
SO TAKE THAT.
OK! BRRRING!

07:16.667 --> 07:18.400
OH, HEY,
WAS THAT BELL?
I THINK IT WAS.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.500
I'M LATE
FOR SOMETHING.
ANYTHING. BYE!

07:24.000 --> 07:25.834
RAE, ANDRE IS
NOT A TAGGER,

07:25.834 --> 07:28.100
AND HE'S NOT A GAMBLER.
YOU'RE JUST TRIPPIN'.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.300
I HOPE SO. THIS IS
THE ONE VISION

07:30.300 --> 07:31.600
THAT I DON'T
WANT TO COME TRUE.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.500
THEN, RAE, STOP
LOOKING FOR TROUBLE.

07:33.500 --> 07:38.400
I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT--
HE'S CHEATING ON ME!

07:38.667 --> 07:41.567
YOU SEE IF?
DO YOU SEE IT?
WHO IS TRIPPIN' NOW?!

07:41.567 --> 07:45.600
YOU TWO-TIMIN' CHEATER!
I STOOD BY YOU WHEN YOU
HAD A TAGGING PROBLEM,

07:45.600 --> 07:49.800
A GAMBLING PROBLEM.
YOU'RE GONNA CHEAT ON ME
WITH SOME HUSSY?!

07:49.800 --> 07:53.300
WITH A BAD WEAVE?

07:53.300 --> 07:56.800
GIRL, LET ME TALK
TO YOU--OH, SNAP!

07:56.800 --> 07:59.667
SHE AIN'T EVEN REAL.

07:59.967 --> 08:05.233
RAVEN, I'M TEACHING
CARDIOPULMONARY
RESUSCITATION.

08:05.233 --> 08:07.400
RESUCI-HUH?

08:07.400 --> 08:10.834
I'M A CPR INSTRUCTOR.

08:12.600 --> 08:15.467
HEH! MY BAD.

08:15.467 --> 08:20.400
THAT'S IT, RAVEN.
THIS BOYFRIEND-
GIRLFRIEND THING,

08:20.400 --> 08:21.600
I DON'T THINK
IT'S WORKING OUT.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.500
I'M BREAKING UP
WITH YOU.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.300
WHAT? WHY? OH!

08:35.100 --> 08:37.500
WHY WOULD ANDRE
BREAK UP WITH ME?

08:37.500 --> 08:39.567
WELL,
LET'S SEE, RAE.
YOU SPIED ON HIM,

08:39.567 --> 08:42.100
EMBARRASSED HIM,
AND ACCUSED HIM OF
BEING A GAMBLER,

08:42.100 --> 08:43.367
A TAGGER,
AND A TWO-TIMER.

08:43.367 --> 08:47.233
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, WE'RE
PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER.

08:47.233 --> 08:49.500
YOU KNOW,
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.734
IN YOUR VISION,
YOU BROKE UP WITH HIM,

08:51.734 --> 08:56.600
BUT IN REAL LIFE,
HE BROKE UP WITH YOU!

08:56.600 --> 09:00.066
HEH HEH HEH!

09:00.066 --> 09:02.133
HOW IS THAT
FUNNY, CHELS?

09:02.133 --> 09:05.967
WELL, IT'S NOT
FUNNY "HA HA."

09:05.967 --> 09:08.500
ANDRE WAS SUCH
A NICE GUY.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.300
HE WAS A TEACHER,

09:10.300 --> 09:12.667
AN ARTIST,
AND A HEALER.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.867
WASN'T MUCH THERE
TO FIX WAS THERE, RAE?

09:14.867 --> 09:17.100
OK, OK, I ADMIT IT!
I MESSED UP,

09:17.100 --> 09:19.934
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE
TO GET HIM BACK.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.900
I MEAN, ALL I HAVE
TO DO IS JUST SHOW HIM

09:22.900 --> 09:24.700
THAT I'M WORTHY
OF BEING HIS GIRLFRIEND.

09:24.700 --> 09:28.033
I THINK YOU SHOWED HIM
ENOUGH FOR ONE DAY.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.233
OK, SON,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:34.233 --> 09:37.767
WHOA! DAD,
IT'S AWESOME!

09:37.767 --> 09:39.100
WE ARE GONNA MAKE
A FORTUNE!

09:39.100 --> 09:42.133
AND CHECK OUT
THE BEST PART. HA HA!

09:42.133 --> 09:44.400
THE BEST PART?
HERE IT COMES! WOW!

09:44.400 --> 09:47.000
"BAXTER AND SON."
DAD, I THOUGHT

09:47.000 --> 09:50.367
WE WERE GONNA CALL IT
THE CHILL GRILL ON WHEELS.

09:50.367 --> 09:52.300
I KNOW, BUT EVERY FATHER
DREAMS OF THE DAY

09:52.300 --> 09:55.600
WHEN HIS SON WANTS
TO FOLLOW IN HIS
FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.500
WHEN YOU SAY "FOLLOW,"
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN?

09:58.500 --> 10:02.000
THE WHOLE
RESTAURANT BUSINESS
FROM THE BOTTOM UP.

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
DICING AND CHOPPING
AND FRYING

10:05.000 --> 10:07.834
AND SCRAPING THE GREASE
OFF THE GRILL.

10:07.834 --> 10:09.734
THAT'S A LOT TO FOLLOW.

10:09.734 --> 10:13.834
AND THE BEST PART IS,
WHEN YOU TURN 16...
UH-HUH?

10:13.834 --> 10:17.834
THIS IS YOUR CAR! HA HA!

10:25.834 --> 10:28.367
OK, ANDRE, NOW, I'M SURE
YOU GOT A GOOD REASON

10:28.367 --> 10:30.500
FOR BREAKING
INTO THAT LOCKER, RIGHT?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.400
SEE? THERE YOU GO AGAIN.

10:32.400 --> 10:33.200
I'M JUST FIXING IT.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.200
THE JANITOR'S
OUT SICK TODAY.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.934
OH. YOU ARE SO GOOD.

10:37.934 --> 10:42.233
AND THEN I GET THIS
CRAZY IDEA THAT THERE
MUST BE SOMETHING WRONG,

11:08.500 --> 11:11.834
I REALLY WOULD LIKE
TO WALK YOU HOME AGAIN.

11:11.834 --> 11:12.567
YOU WOULD?

11:12.567 --> 11:13.300
