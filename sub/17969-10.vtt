WEBVTT

00:15.816 --> 00:17.352
- Alan?
- Shh.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.021
Alan?
Hey. It's all right, Sarah.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.997
What happened?
Just try to relax.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.533
Where am I?
In Isolation.

00:24.892 --> 00:28.032
We're preparing to do a scan
of your tumor.

00:29.162 --> 00:30.903
My tumor?

00:32.499 --> 00:34.410
How did you find out?

00:34.568 --> 00:38.983
Hatake found the soar from your surgery.
Let's just get these scans done, okay?

00:39.172 --> 00:40.852
Give me a minute
to get to the imaging room

00:40.874 --> 00:43.081
and I'll monitor the scans
as they come out.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.051
Okay. Alan.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.020
This will be quick, I promise.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.060
All right?

01:26.386 --> 01:27.626
Hey, look behind you!

01:30.457 --> 01:32.368
Alan, help!

01:37.464 --> 01:39.068
What's wrong?

01:42.402 --> 01:43.574
You were screaming.

01:51.478 --> 01:54.823
I loved your mother very much.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.592
She felt the same.

01:59.486 --> 02:04.936
But when she found out
about the Inuit children

02:05.559 --> 02:07.470
she took you away,

02:08.762 --> 02:11.072
forbid me to see you.

02:11.264 --> 02:14.074
But I have looked after you
in my own way.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.641
Inuit children?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.343
You stole them.

02:20.907 --> 02:23.751
Most were placed in homes,

02:23.944 --> 02:28.791
given to those unable
to have children of their own.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.755
Most?

02:31.284 --> 02:33.662
None of those lives
were yours to give.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.368
I deeply regret what I've done.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.039
Seems like you really believe that.

02:49.870 --> 02:53.443
This is the night I received
the National Science Fellowship.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.177
I was very proud of you.

02:57.144 --> 03:00.990
You were there?
I am an honorary member of the board.

03:01.948 --> 03:04.792
I voted for you, but nothing more.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.362
You won that on your own.

03:06.553 --> 03:09.295
Of course I did, because
despite what you might think

03:09.489 --> 03:12.333
this stalker book proves,
you have nothing to do with me

03:12.526 --> 03:14.506
or anything I've ever done.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.969
Julia, please.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.640
Our eyes,

03:19.666 --> 03:21.145
why are they silver?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.876
A rare genetic anomaly.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.074
You're lying.

03:26.306 --> 03:29.549
Tell me the truth. I deserve that.

03:31.178 --> 03:33.920
I'm trying to protect you.

03:37.417 --> 03:39.920
It's not your job to protect me.

03:54.601 --> 03:57.582
The tumor has extended
into your spinal fluid

03:57.771 --> 04:00.411
and there's a real chance

04:00.607 --> 04:02.518
that ifs spreading to your brain.

04:07.114 --> 04:09.720
I just wanted to go out into the field.

04:11.852 --> 04:12.922
Just once.

04:13.386 --> 04:16.629
This was my last chance
to really do something that mattered.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.764
I'm sorry I lied to you.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.870
It's okay.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.043
It's okay.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.879
I'm really glad you're here.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.228
Okay, stop moving.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.418
Stop hurting me.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.764
Tulok is throwing the ilaria bodies
out on the ice.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.435
I'm fine, thanks for asking.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.128
Wouldn't know it by listening
to you moan like a baby.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.432
We checked everyone else,
no serious injuries.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.576
Right, nothing at all
serious about this.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.941
It's a miracle
nobody else got hurt.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.005
Thanks to you.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.647
But this isn't over, is it?

05:07.841 --> 05:10.981
Ilaria won't stop. Ever.

05:11.978 --> 05:16.256
They'll hunt down every single person in
this village just to keep their secrets.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.158
Well, what are we gonna
do about it?

05:20.353 --> 05:21.798
We're not gonna do anything.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.492
You're gonna take your people...
Our people, Miksa.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.969
Whatever. You need to
leave here as soon as possible.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.540
This is our home.
We're not gonna run.

05:31.765 --> 05:33.506
Anana, he's right.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.139
Our blood is in this ice.

05:36.336 --> 05:40.148
Your blood on the ice is all that's
gonna be left if you stay here.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.451
If you scatter to the wind,
you still have a fighting chance.

05:50.450 --> 05:52.726
He's been watching me my whole life.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.729
Album was filled
with photos of me from Atlanta,

05:55.956 --> 05:57.993
medical school,
even my overseas postings.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.828
He told me his daughter
died in a fire. A complete lie.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.237
He's done nothing but lie to us
from the day we got here.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.139
There was this picture
of all of us together like a family.

06:07.300 --> 06:11.476
Me, Hatake and my mother
in that cabin downstairs.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.008
I grew up here.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.982
So did a lot of other kids

06:16.176 --> 06:17.985
who he experimented on.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.391
He might have done something to you
while you were sick down on Level R.

06:22.582 --> 06:25.688
Code 725.
To his own daughter?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.888
<i>Attention, Code 725...</i>

06:28.088 --> 06:30.864
<i>I'm gonna find Hatake.
Level G, Bacteriology.</i>

06:31.057 --> 06:33.765
<i>Attention, Code 725, Level G...</i>

06:48.341 --> 06:50.947
I found something you may want to see.
Where is it?

06:51.177 --> 06:54.715
Where is this scrapbook?
How long have you been stalking her?

06:54.915 --> 06:58.362
If you are here to accuse me
of watching over Julia,

06:58.551 --> 07:00.087
I openly admit to doing so.

07:00.287 --> 07:03.029
What you've been doing is sick.

07:03.223 --> 07:04.861
I am her father.

07:05.225 --> 07:07.034
She might not accept that

07:07.227 --> 07:09.639
but a simple DNA test can prove it.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.770
You lost your rights
to be her father years ago.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.915
A topic I would enjoy
debating with you

07:19.105 --> 07:22.643
were there not
something more pressing.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.818
Dr. Adrian is departing the base

07:26.980 --> 07:30.621
with the missing core samples
of the Narvik.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.561
Where's he going?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.829
Nowhere.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.934
There is nothing out there
but certain death.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.104
He doesn't look like
he's going nowhere.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.172
The ice will take him.
Trust me.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.008
Ironic words coming from you.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.945
The important thing
is that the virus is gone.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.086
And like Dr. Adrian,

07:56.343 --> 07:59.256
it will never be found.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.954
If Narvik makes it
out of the Arctic Circle,

08:04.150 --> 08:07.757
there's no turning back,
millions will die.

08:07.954 --> 08:09.456
And those who don't die,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.500
they'll be vectors,
spreading the disease until...

08:12.692 --> 08:15.332
So why did Adrian
take all the Narvik?

08:15.528 --> 08:19.806
Either he works for ilaria,
or he's about to.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.042
Juneau's eight days out.

08:24.270 --> 08:26.648
No, he'd never make it that far
on a snowmobile.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.949
Echelon deep-space listening
station, abandoned in '85.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.520
It's only 50 miles out.

08:35.015 --> 08:38.962
What are the chances the radio
is still working 29 years later?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.359
I think we're about to find out.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.133
Julia, don't. It's too dangerous.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.964
The virus is gone.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.065
Julia.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.311
Alan?

08:55.502 --> 08:57.573
Don't.
We need to go.

09:24.431 --> 09:26.843
My National Science Award,

09:27.233 --> 09:29.270
what did you do with it
when we moved out?

09:30.837 --> 09:36.082
I, um... I put it in storage
with the rest of your stuff.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.244
What's got you thinking about that?

09:39.179 --> 09:41.352
We never really talked
about that night.

09:45.351 --> 09:47.024
What's there to talk about?

09:48.555 --> 09:51.365
I always wondered
why you gave Peter your ticket.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.267
Is this about me and Sarah?

09:55.695 --> 09:59.575
No. You know what-f?
You said you didn't wanna talk about it.

09:59.766 --> 10:03.646
And I don't. I just... I... Ah.
You know what? Forget it.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.268
<i>I don't wanna
become one of those things.</i>

10:30.430 --> 10:32.501
<i>You know what I'm asking.</i>

10:32.732 --> 10:35.008
<i>I can't do it myself. Please.</i>

10:35.835 --> 10:37.644
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:51.017 --> 10:55.466
<i>Scheduled
maintenance, Bacteriology, Level G.</i>

11:02.595 --> 11:05.701
Dr. Jordan,
you should be resting.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.670
You mean dying?

11:07.867 --> 11:08.937
No thanks.

11:09.135 --> 11:11.638
Whatever time I have left
I wanna spend in the lab.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.655
Let me help you.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.196
You can just set it there.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.063
Thank you.

11:34.460 --> 11:37.873
Do you know where Dr. Farragut
and Dr. Walker went?

11:38.064 --> 11:40.169
They didn't tell you?

11:40.633 --> 11:42.806
They don't trust me.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.680
Can you blame them?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.248
I've done things,

11:51.010 --> 11:54.480
terrible things,
in the name of science.

11:57.150 --> 12:01.360
Edward Jenner infected
an 8-year-old boy with smallpox

12:01.554 --> 12:03.591
to test an unproven theory.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.825
He could've been charged
with murder.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.333
But the child survived.

12:10.363 --> 12:14.106
And Jenner pioneered the use
of modern vaccinations.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.076
He saved millions of lives.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.715
You may have done
some terrible things,

12:21.674 --> 12:25.850
but I can't help but think none of that will
matter if we get this antiviral to work.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.236
- Can you hear me?
<i>- Yes,</i> I can.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.437
As long as your bosses
at ilaria meet my price

13:22.101 --> 13:24.809
and get me out of here,
you'll get your stuff.

13:28.741 --> 13:29.947
Adrian.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.124
Stop! Don't make me use this.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.022
Take it easy with that.
We're not here to hurt you.

13:37.250 --> 13:40.697
Like you just happened to be in the
neighborhood, decided to stop by?

13:41.020 --> 13:44.092
Alan. The Narvik.

13:45.258 --> 13:47.499
<i>Do you have the package?
I need confirmation.</i>

13:47.694 --> 13:52.006
Shit. Just give me a second.
You can't make a deal with these people.

13:52.198 --> 13:54.337
They will take what they want
and kill you.

13:54.534 --> 13:57.947
I've worked too hard to leave with nothing.
The virus could kill millions.

13:58.137 --> 14:01.311
This is a CDC problem. I just want
you people to stay in business.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.487
<i>Do you have confirmation?</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:05.519
Hello? Damn it. Hey!

14:30.870 --> 14:33.146
Unh. You okay?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.013
It's just a scratch. Can't
say the <i>same</i> for the radio.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.916
It's pretty busted up,
but I think I can fix it.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.415
Since when?

14:41.814 --> 14:44.260
I've had to learn to do
a lot of things without you.

14:44.484 --> 14:48.193
It's chilly in here, but it's
downright subzero between you two.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.665
Battery's toast. We're gonna
need another power source.

14:51.858 --> 14:55.738
This place must have had a backup
generator. I'll see if I can find it.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.176
You're not coming with us, are you?
I have no choice.

15:06.372 --> 15:08.909
You do, and you keep
choosing him.

15:09.108 --> 15:13.079
Look, when ilaria's finished with
the <i>base,</i> they'll be coming here.

15:13.546 --> 15:15.048
I can slow them down,

15:16.048 --> 15:17.925
give our people a fighting chance.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.096
Miksa.
What's wrong?

15:22.522 --> 15:25.059
- A snowmobile's missing.
- Who's gone?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.202
No one from our village.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.431
How many homes did you pm m?
Four.

15:30.630 --> 15:34.203
No, no. Five passed me on
the way to the village last night.

15:35.067 --> 15:38.139
The only advantage we had is
ilaria didn't know what happened here.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.580
They still won't, not if
I can stop him.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.118
I'm going with you. Unh.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.450
You'll just slow me down.

15:47.413 --> 15:50.257
- Get everyone out as fast as you can.
- Let's go.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.182
We checked Julia's blood already.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.295
There's no viral antibodies.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.667
Did you notice
anything abnormal?

16:04.263 --> 16:05.640
Not from the test, no.

16:05.832 --> 16:09.177
Then you need to change
your perspective.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.610
Look at the form,
the structure of the DNA.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.952
Why? What am I going
to find?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.314
I don't know.

16:17.944 --> 16:21.619
But there must be something.

16:22.815 --> 16:27.093
Some would call Dr. Walker's
recovery miraculous.

16:28.187 --> 16:30.599
I do not believe in miracles.

16:30.790 --> 16:34.533
My faith lies in science.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.805
I believe that is a quality
we share.

16:42.034 --> 16:44.275
Julia's the expert.

16:45.204 --> 16:47.844
If she were here,
she could find what I'm missing.

16:48.040 --> 16:52.511
When I saw you pressing
forward in spite of everything,

16:52.712 --> 16:56.353
that is a mark of
a true scientist.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.520
Do not give up now.

17:00.953 --> 17:04.491

and the good Dr. Farragut?

17:28.915 --> 17:31.919
You know, I had a lab assistant
once. She was a real locker.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.258
Banged her like a drum
for a while. Then I got bored

17:35.488 --> 17:38.367
and it just turned
into a real nightmare.

17:38.558 --> 17:41.869
I had to fire her so she'd stop
making moony eyes at me all day.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.098
Is that what happened to you?

17:44.330 --> 17:46.332
Did he toss you aside
for a new flavor?

17:47.667 --> 17:51.615
That Dr. Jordan, huh? Ooh.
She's a real hot piece, huh?

17:51.771 --> 17:55.844
Mm, she's a real hot...
Shut up.

18:00.947 --> 18:04.394
I found the backup generator.

18:04.550 --> 18:06.530

18:07.053 --> 18:09.192
You didn't fix this yet?

18:09.388 --> 18:10.526

18:10.690 --> 18:12.795

18:14.560 --> 18:16.870

18:21.534 --> 18:24.811

18:24.971 --> 18:29.147

18:30.042 --> 18:32.545
I repeat,
this is a mayday situation.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.783
I am Dr. Julia Walker
with the Center for Disease Control.

18:35.982 --> 18:37.984
We are in need
of emergency assistance

18:38.150 --> 18:39.424
at Arctic...
Let me try.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.258
Just give me a second.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.229
I can't believe
that I didn't see it earlier.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.908
That kind of easy disdain
is born and bred in marriage.

18:51.097 --> 18:54.909
Let me guess. A rocky divorce?
I'm not gonna tell you again to shut up.

18:55.101 --> 18:57.012
Well, it seems like you just did.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.019
Get down!

19:14.253 --> 19:15.698
Get to the door.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.704
Throw out the virus
and no one else has to die!

19:31.637 --> 19:33.275
Follow me.

19:44.283 --> 19:49.198
All we want is the virus. Throw
it outside and we'll let you go!

19:50.056 --> 19:52.832
I think there's only one of them.
How do you know?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.232
Because if he had friends,

19:55.828 --> 19:59.799
they'd have broken down the door
by now. Either way,

20:00.666 --> 20:02.668
he won't let us walk out of here.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.722
Can you reach it?
I don't know.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.685
So much for the radio.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.805
What do you want, Peter?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.144
Why are you here?

21:11.637 --> 21:13.412
I want to help you.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.586
No.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.216
Please.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.448
This will all be over soon.

21:20.646 --> 21:25.595
Sooner than you think.

21:33.592 --> 21:36.334
I really thought I was close
to a breakthrough.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.675
What?
Your awards presentation.

21:39.899 --> 21:41.901
The National Science thing.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.274
I was wrapped up in work.
You wanna talk now?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.848
In the snowcat,
when you brought it up, I...

21:47.239 --> 21:48.513
It all came back to me.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.751
The ceremony was half over,
they were about to call me,

21:54.914 --> 21:59.488
you still hadn't shown up. I was mad,
but I know how you lose track of time.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.995
I realized when Peter showed up,

22:01.187 --> 22:03.827
you didn't get lost in the work,
you just chose not to come.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.639
I think about
that night all the time.

22:17.036 --> 22:20.279
I mean, if I hadn't
given Peter my ticket,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.846
would you guys have ended up...?

22:23.709 --> 22:26.622
You asked about the last time
I'd seen Peter. I lied to you.

22:26.812 --> 22:28.348
I know.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.486
He told me.

22:31.984 --> 22:34.224
I should have told you the truth.
I just didn't know how.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.065
Come on.

22:37.656 --> 22:40.899
Your National Science Award
is not in storage.

22:43.629 --> 22:46.974
I smashed it to pieces
about a week after you left.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.506
Cut the hell out of my hand.

22:55.574 --> 22:57.485
I'm sorry.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.422
I'm sorry too, Jules.

23:05.251 --> 23:07.026
He's coming in.

23:09.688 --> 23:14.228

23:14.393 --> 23:16.839

23:16.996 --> 23:18.498

23:28.240 --> 23:30.743
Please tell me
there's no cabin down there.

23:33.078 --> 23:36.025
I wanted to log this just in case.

23:38.784 --> 23:43.529
I re-sequenced Julia's DNA
and I found something incredible.

23:43.722 --> 23:47.568
We were so intent on finding antibodies
to the virus, we missed this completely.

23:49.695 --> 23:51.868
This is a scan of Julia's telomeres
eight days ago

23:52.064 --> 23:54.601
when she was first infected
with the virus.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.879
And this is her sample
from two days ago.

23:59.538 --> 24:02.212
You can see her telomeres
have lengthened,

24:02.408 --> 24:04.786
restored to the lengths
you'd see in a newborn

24:04.977 --> 24:07.321
all without requiring telomerase.

24:07.479 --> 24:10.790
Is this a side effect of the virus
like the pigmentation in her eyes

24:10.983 --> 24:13.293
or is this why she recovered?

24:14.253 --> 24:15.391
I'm not sure,

24:15.587 --> 24:20.969
but I don't have to tell you that
the medical possibilities are endless.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.834
Theoretically, we could induce
the absence of telomerase.

24:24.063 --> 24:27.101
That would remove the fuel necessary
for cancer cells to grow

24:27.299 --> 24:30.746
and if we could remove the fuel,
then my cancer cells would die.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.644
That's why Dr. Hatake told me
to look at Julia's DNA.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.683
Somehow he knew. If we supplement
my weakened immune system,

24:36.909 --> 24:39.389
target the tumor directly,
inject Julia's cerebral spinal fluid

24:39.511 --> 24:41.855
into my central nervous system...

24:45.784 --> 24:47.695
I'm gonna start trials
on the computer

24:47.920 --> 24:50.833
and see if I can get a prep
on a spinal tap.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.963
If I'm gone
by the time you get back,

24:56.628 --> 24:59.939
or if this is just me
grasping at straws,

25:01.433 --> 25:04.141
I just want you to know
I'm not scared.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.948
<i>I'm ready.</i>

25:07.940 --> 25:09.112
<i>I guess that's all.</i>

25:15.814 --> 25:17.657
We're just going further
into the ice.

25:17.816 --> 25:19.955
What if there's not
another way out?

25:31.363 --> 25:33.138
What was that?

27:11.730 --> 27:12.902
Who am I?

27:16.268 --> 27:19.806
I remember being a scientist

27:21.006 --> 27:23.247

any moment. We need to move.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.162
Constance?

27:45.030 --> 27:48.477
What?
I had to pick a side.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.169
Constance made me choose,

27:50.335 --> 27:52.042
so I did.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.883
That's why Hiroshi
locked me up down here.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.816
Tell them there are rules
we must follow.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.960
- There can be no more than 500.
- Five hundred what?

28:05.551 --> 28:07.792
Talk to me, damn it!
Tell me about your eyes!

28:10.489 --> 28:15.700
You can survive four minutes
without oxygen,

28:15.894 --> 28:19.171
four days without water,

28:19.364 --> 28:22.538
40 days without food.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.577
There was so much pain.

28:29.474 --> 28:32.250
Rebirth feels like dying.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.519
We had no idea,

28:35.714 --> 28:38.991
the enormity of it at the time.

28:40.185 --> 28:44.930
We thought we had found
the ultimate gift.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.162
Eternal life.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.604
But to live forever

28:51.830 --> 28:56.040
is to die 10,000 times.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.447
Your brother said
we're almost ready to move out.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.615
You've been standing there
for a while.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.793
I was wondering when
you were gonna say something.

29:12.618 --> 29:14.859
Trying to give you some time.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.028
For what?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.595
This is our home.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.969
We shouldn't be running from it.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.771
I learned at a young age,
you build a home out of people,

29:25.964 --> 29:27.875
not places.

29:28.233 --> 29:29.803
Yeah?

29:30.035 --> 29:32.709
And where's your home, Sergio?

29:37.242 --> 29:38.812
I, uh...

29:41.880 --> 29:43.086
I haven't found it yet.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.888
You didn't have to come back here.

29:46.084 --> 29:47.961
After what Miksa did to you,

29:48.153 --> 29:50.463
how I treated you,

29:51.156 --> 29:53.432
you could've let them come.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.939
Everyone in this village

29:58.430 --> 30:00.842
owes you their life.

30:04.069 --> 30:06.106
Doesn't excuse
the things I've done.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.008
You're right.

30:08.774 --> 30:11.084
But it can be a start.

30:11.276 --> 30:14.985
You can be the man you want to be,
not the man they made you.

30:23.855 --> 30:24.993
Do you believe him?

30:26.925 --> 30:28.461
No, I don't believe him.

30:28.960 --> 30:32.498
What he said is crazy, and if you'd
have asked me 10 days ago if I thought

30:32.698 --> 30:35.542
any of this was true...
We are talking about immortality.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.940
So much has happened
that we can't explain.

30:38.303 --> 30:42.149
We can explain it,
scientifically, not with fairy tales.

30:42.341 --> 30:44.844
I survived the virus
without antibodies in my blood

30:45.043 --> 30:48.490
and my eyes, they're just like his.
I just need to know what I am now.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.053
He's found the hatch.

30:55.020 --> 30:57.899
Stay here.
We have to hide the virus.

31:30.355 --> 31:32.392
An hour and 42 minutes
in culture

31:32.591 --> 31:35.037
the cancer cells are showing...

31:52.110 --> 31:54.522
How long have you
been down here?

31:54.780 --> 31:58.557
Two... No, nine.

31:59.684 --> 32:00.890
Twenty-nine.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.394
Days?

32:05.390 --> 32:08.098
Twenty-nine years,

32:08.293 --> 32:11.638
10,500 days,

32:11.863 --> 32:14.139
give or take a week.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.409
Why did Hatake
chain you down here?

32:18.136 --> 32:21.583
Every night I have dreamed
of my revenge.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.749
I have killed him
thousands of times,

32:25.944 --> 32:28.481
a thousand different ways.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.083
You hate him also.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.494
Why is that?

32:38.824 --> 32:39.996
We have to go.

32:40.225 --> 32:44.105
He's in the tunnel.
I hid the bag in case we're caught.

32:45.163 --> 32:46.267
Free me.

32:48.934 --> 32:52.108
No. No. He's out of his mind.
We can't trust him.

32:52.571 --> 32:55.814
If we don't let him go, they'll
kill him, and I need answers.

33:05.317 --> 33:06.523
Get off me!

33:09.988 --> 33:11.661
What are you doing?

33:11.857 --> 33:14.133
The longer you live,
the more you will lose.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.172
You will have to watch everyone
you have ever loved die.

33:18.363 --> 33:21.367
There is nothing in this world
to fill an eternity.

33:21.933 --> 33:23.207
Free me.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.499
Don't move.
Hands where I can see them.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.238
Where's the virus?

33:56.334 --> 33:58.644
I don't know.
Suit yourself.

33:58.837 --> 34:02.148
You have 10 seconds to tell me
where it is before I pull this trigger.

34:02.340 --> 34:04.911
Or maybe I shoot her first.
No.

34:36.341 --> 34:39.583
It's done.
No more Narvik.

34:44.282 --> 34:46.056
You Okay?

34:46.251 --> 34:49.721
Yeah, I think. I'm just...

34:52.958 --> 34:54.460
You don't really believe that.

34:54.693 --> 34:56.695
What should I believe, Alan?

35:02.100 --> 35:03.204
Come on.

35:07.539 --> 35:10.577
- Engine's not frozen up. It should start.
- Oh, thank God.

35:10.775 --> 35:13.551
Don't thank him yet.
We still have to get home.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.615
What happened?

35:46.811 --> 35:48.620
I found her in BSL-3.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.349
She appears to have suffered

35:50.515 --> 35:52.256
multiple grand mal seizures.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.792
Sarah, I'm here.
Can you hear me?

35:56.988 --> 35:59.093
It's me, it's Alan.

36:00.592 --> 36:03.334
What do you have her on?
Propofol.

36:04.329 --> 36:09.142
I had to induce coma
to slop the seizures.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.838
Her vitals are too low.
She doesn't have long.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.317
Where were you?

36:18.810 --> 36:20.448
Echelon Station.

36:22.147 --> 36:23.990
We met Gunnar Mikaelsson.

36:31.022 --> 36:34.060
This is not how I wanted you
to find out.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.225
I don't think you
wanted anyone to find out,

36:36.227 --> 36:38.969
locking him up in a dungeon
50 miles away.

36:47.038 --> 36:49.814
He betrayed your mother to Sutton.

36:50.308 --> 36:52.185
It was a death sentence.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.017
I repaid him with a life sentence.

36:57.515 --> 36:59.995
I know you don't trust me,

37:00.518 --> 37:02.998
but I was protecting you.

37:03.188 --> 37:04.861
They have gone to

37:05.023 --> 37:06.423
great lengths
to keep their secrets.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.271
Who are they?
The 500.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.004
Yes.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.576
Five hundred immortals.

37:19.104 --> 37:22.244
They run Ilaria Corporation.

37:25.577 --> 37:26.715
She's crashing.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.060
Clear.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.697
<i>If I'm gone by the time you get back,</i>

37:38.890 --> 37:41.234
<i>I just wanted you to know
I'm not scared.</i>

37:43.394 --> 37:46.967
<i>And, Alan, I know
that you don't believe in life after this,</i>

37:48.366 --> 37:51.870
<i>and I don't either, but I'm ready.</i>

37:53.938 --> 37:55.781
<i>Dr. Hatake
said something to me earlier.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:59.786
<i>He said his faith lies in science.</i>

38:00.612 --> 38:02.455
<i>I guess mine does too.</i>

38:02.647 --> 38:05.890
<i>And science has proven
that nothing disappears without a trace.</i>

38:06.084 --> 38:08.064
<i>Nature doesn't know extinction,</i>

38:08.253 --> 38:10.324
<i>only transformation.</i>

38:10.555 --> 38:14.298
<i>We're all made up of the same atoms
that created the universe, right?</i>

38:15.894 --> 38:18.465
In essence, we all live forever.

38:31.075 --> 38:32.952
She doesn't have much time.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.647
A few hours at the most.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.928
If we are going to act,

38:40.118 --> 38:42.689
we must do it quickly.
How?

38:42.921 --> 38:45.765
The cancer is in her brain.
She's... She's dying.

38:46.257 --> 38:49.261
Then she has nothing to lose.

38:51.362 --> 38:53.968
All my life,
I've adhered to science.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.304
You're asking me
to believe in miracles.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.112
Are they so different?

39:02.440 --> 39:05.046
You believe you can save her?

39:05.276 --> 39:06.619
No.

39:07.478 --> 39:09.458
But Julia can.

40:13.578 --> 40:16.184
