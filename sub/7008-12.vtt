Welcome to Remodeling Week
here on <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:08.925 --> 00:12.861
Now, here's the star of the show,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

00:14.330 --> 00:16.265
Thank you, Heidi.
Thank you, everybody.

00:16.332 --> 00:18.066
Welcome to <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:18.134 --> 00:20.168
I am Tim "The Grateful
Tool Man" Taylor,

00:20.236 --> 00:23.071
and, of course,
you all know my assistant.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:32.048 --> 00:34.248
Okay, I'm a perch, I'll bite.

00:35.651 --> 00:37.151
Well, Tim, it's Remodeling Week.

00:37.219 --> 00:39.153
I know that.

00:39.221 --> 00:42.057
Well, I've worn this shirt before,
so now I'm re-modeling it.

00:46.929 --> 00:49.731
Uh, all right.
Well, over the years,

00:49.799 --> 00:52.834
we've shown you a lot of different
ways to upgrade your home.

00:52.902 --> 00:54.302
But when the job is big enough,

00:54.369 --> 00:55.737
it's time to ask
for the expertise

00:55.805 --> 00:57.739
of a licensed, bonded,
professional contractor.

00:57.807 --> 01:00.441
But finding a good
contractor can be,

01:00.509 --> 01:03.678
well, as difficult as
finding a date to the prom.

01:06.348 --> 01:07.949
Yes, it can, Al.

01:09.351 --> 01:12.887
But this time,
your mom won't bail you out.

01:12.955 --> 01:17.726
"Al, I can't fit in a limousine.
Better use a backhoe."

01:17.793 --> 01:22.563
As I was saying, choosing a good
contractor can be a daunting task.

01:22.632 --> 01:23.836
You gotta ask
the right questions.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.066
Are you licensed?

01:25.134 --> 01:26.668
Do you have a completion clause?

01:26.736 --> 01:31.272
Are you using a porta-potty,
or just using my front lawn?

01:31.340 --> 01:35.710
So, without further ado, let's
play The Contracting Game.

01:35.778 --> 01:37.579
Whoo! Let's meet
our contestants!

01:46.321 --> 01:48.322
All right!

01:48.390 --> 01:52.327
Contractor number one is an
ex-Navy man from Saginaw

01:52.394 --> 01:57.432
who enjoys appraisals, electrical
work and long walks on the beach.

01:57.499 --> 01:59.033
Bill, say hello to Tim.

01:59.101 --> 02:00.969
- Hi, Tim.
- Hey, Bill.

02:01.037 --> 02:04.940
Contractor number two calls
himself a trustworthy Taurus

02:05.007 --> 02:06.875
who wrote the primmer on primer.

02:06.943 --> 02:07.943
Wally, say hello to Tim.

02:08.009 --> 02:09.911
- Hi, Tim.
- Wally.

02:09.979 --> 02:11.746
And contractor
number three says he's

02:11.814 --> 02:14.483
great at grouting,
enjoys fine dining

02:14.550 --> 02:17.686
and will paint any surface
at the drop of a cloth.

02:17.820 --> 02:18.586
Ed, say hello to Tim.

02:18.654 --> 02:19.988
Hi, Tim.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.957
Tim, <i>Tool Time</i> is by far
my favorite show.

02:23.025 --> 02:25.627
I like him already.

02:25.694 --> 02:29.131
All right. Well, we've established
that these men are qualified.

02:29.198 --> 02:33.501
So let's see how they stand up to the
tough questions from The Tool Man.

02:33.569 --> 02:36.738
Thank you, Al. All right,
contractor number three,

02:36.806 --> 02:39.808
you say my kitchen work can be
done in, uh, what? Six weeks?

02:39.876 --> 02:42.176
That's contractor time.
What is that in real time?

02:42.244 --> 02:44.713
Sixteen weeks
and not a day more.

02:44.780 --> 02:46.352
There's something
to be said for honesty.

02:46.382 --> 02:47.782
Okay, 18 weeks.

02:49.284 --> 02:53.221
Contractor number two, I want
to put in a new bathroom.

02:53.289 --> 02:55.190
Tile, sink, maybe a Jacuzzi.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.025
For 10 grand, can it be done?

02:57.093 --> 02:59.360
Well, actually,
that seems a little low.

02:59.428 --> 03:01.195
Hey, Tim. It's Ed,
contractor number three.

03:01.263 --> 03:02.998
I can do it for nine-five.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.601
All right,
contractor number one,

03:06.669 --> 03:09.804
putting a parquet floor
in my, uh, dining room.

03:09.872 --> 03:11.205
You get a call
from the hospital.

03:11.273 --> 03:12.874
It's your wife.
She's having a baby.

03:12.942 --> 03:15.443
Do you finish the floor
or race to the hospital?

03:15.511 --> 03:18.412
Well, Tim, my wife and I have been
trying to have a baby for three years.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.783
I've been trying to have
a parquet floor for 10.

03:21.851 --> 03:26.088
Well, I mean, if you really needed the
work done, uh, I guess I'd do it.

03:26.155 --> 03:29.115
Look at it this way, the floor will
probably last longer than the marriage.

03:30.492 --> 03:33.095
Yeah. Especially now,
since my wife is watching.

03:34.296 --> 03:36.364
So the moment of truth has come.

03:36.432 --> 03:38.566
Are you going with
contractor number one,

03:38.634 --> 03:42.103
contractor number two,
or contractor number three?

03:43.272 --> 03:44.639
Hey, Tim, it's Ed again.

03:44.706 --> 03:48.210
I would leave my family
to do your parquet floor.

03:48.277 --> 03:51.313
And yet I'm gonna go with
contractor number one!

03:52.314 --> 03:53.848
Yeah!

03:53.916 --> 03:55.249
Congratulations.

03:55.317 --> 03:58.853
All right. Okay.

03:58.921 --> 04:00.801
- Congratulations, Bill.
- Thank you. Thank you.

04:00.856 --> 04:02.016
Now, when do I start the job?

04:02.658 --> 04:03.958
Job?

04:04.026 --> 04:06.294
We're just playing a game here.
There's no job.

04:06.362 --> 04:08.396
I took a whole day off
for nothing?

04:08.464 --> 04:10.365
I assumed there was a job.

04:10.433 --> 04:13.335
Well, you know what happens
when you assume.

04:15.437 --> 04:19.074
Well, what happens is Heidi's
gonna tell you what you won.

04:19.774 --> 04:21.209
Uh...

04:21.276 --> 04:24.913
You won this key ring
with a handy can opener.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.716
- There you go.
- There you go.

04:27.783 --> 04:29.550
Yeah. That's gonna
come in real handy

04:29.719 --> 04:32.854
'cause I'm about to open up a can
of whoop-ass on the Tool Man.

05:28.077 --> 05:31.913
Jill, the girls' birthday cake is great.
What's your secret?

05:31.981 --> 05:35.350
Gretchen's Bakery. It's that place
with the flashing neon lederhosen.

05:35.618 --> 05:39.854
You know, I always thought Gretchen
was selling something else there.

05:39.856 --> 05:42.290
Hey, girls, come on. Let's
keep this party rolling.

05:42.358 --> 05:44.159
I gotta get to work.

05:44.226 --> 05:47.195
Hey, Uncle Marty, my dad says you
have a job in canine nutrition.

05:47.262 --> 05:51.299
I stack kibble at
a dog-food warehouse.

05:51.366 --> 05:53.802
Okay, girls. What do you say?
Is it time to open presents?

05:53.869 --> 05:55.636
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

05:55.705 --> 05:56.942
Yes? All right. Come on,
give me a hand, will you?

05:56.972 --> 05:58.572
Okay. Now, wait...
Keep your eyes closed.

05:58.607 --> 06:00.208
No looking. No looking. Wait.

06:00.275 --> 06:02.048
Come on, Aunt Jill, please!
Oh, come on, please!

06:02.078 --> 06:04.045
- No, no, no.
- Okay!

06:04.113 --> 06:07.916
And happy birthday!

06:07.983 --> 06:09.951
A new bike! Just what I wanted!

06:10.019 --> 06:11.119
Thanks, Dad!

06:11.187 --> 06:12.324
Now you can ride around
the neighborhood

06:12.354 --> 06:13.822
mowing down three-year-olds.

06:15.191 --> 06:16.257
Thanks, Tim.

06:16.325 --> 06:18.559
This is from Brad and me.

06:23.632 --> 06:25.600
Legos! All right!

06:25.667 --> 06:28.169
And let me see. These are
from Uncle Tim and me.

06:28.237 --> 06:30.705
That's for you
and this is for you.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.711
The Spice Girls!

06:36.779 --> 06:38.947
Wow! I got Posh Spice!

06:39.014 --> 06:43.384
I got Sporty Spice.
I want Posh Spice.

06:43.452 --> 06:45.120
But you love Sporty Spice.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.821
You were Sporty Spice
for Halloween.

06:46.888 --> 06:49.457
I want Posh Spice.

06:49.525 --> 06:51.426
But they gave me Posh Spice.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.361
Upstairs, I got some Old Spice.

06:56.965 --> 06:59.700
Listen, Gracie, why don't you just
trade dolls with Claire, okay?

06:59.768 --> 07:00.835
Do I have to?

07:00.902 --> 07:02.007
Well, that's not really fair.

07:02.037 --> 07:03.642
I mean, we sort of did give
that doll to Gracie.

07:03.672 --> 07:05.239
Yeah. If it'll make
her sister happy,

07:05.307 --> 07:06.479
I mean, does it really
make a difference?

07:06.509 --> 07:07.509
Come on, honey.

07:07.576 --> 07:09.010
Okay.

07:09.077 --> 07:12.947
That's a girl. I love you guys.
Come here.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.349
Hey, now, listen,
I gotta go, okay?

07:15.417 --> 07:17.289
I'm really sorry I gotta go
to work on your birthday,

07:17.319 --> 07:19.921
but I'll come on back later and
we'll have a good time, okay?

07:19.989 --> 07:21.055
- Okay. Bye.
- See you.

07:21.123 --> 07:22.557
- See you later, Marty.
- Bye-bye.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.959
Aunt Jill, can we go play
with our dolls upstairs?

07:25.027 --> 07:26.995
Of course you can. Go on.

07:27.062 --> 07:28.934
Hey, guys, guys, will you put these
Legos together for the girls

07:28.964 --> 07:30.398
and take them up to them?

07:30.465 --> 07:32.266
Mom, we're building a fort.

07:35.171 --> 07:37.572
Excuse me, uh, 17?

07:37.639 --> 07:40.375
I'm only 14.
I'm hanging onto my youth.

07:41.644 --> 07:43.277
It's time to let go.

07:46.581 --> 07:48.682
- Can you believe what Marty just did?
- No.

07:48.750 --> 07:51.319
Buying these bikes
off the rack like this?

07:51.387 --> 07:52.587
These gear ratios and tires...

07:52.654 --> 07:55.656
You'll never get any speed
out of these puppies.

07:55.724 --> 07:57.425
I'm not talking about the bikes.

07:57.493 --> 07:59.727
I'm talking about the way
he's dealing with the girls.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.229
He's just trying
to make her happy.

08:01.363 --> 08:03.297
Yeah. At her sister's expense.

08:03.365 --> 08:06.167
He's not doing Claire any
favors by giving in to her.

08:06.234 --> 08:07.835
He's letting her
just take control.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.904
- This is none of our business.
- Yes, it is.

08:09.972 --> 08:12.277
No, it's not. We don't know
anything about raising two girls.

08:12.307 --> 08:15.376
Excuse me, someone in this
room was a girl once.

08:15.577 --> 08:18.146
That was years ago
before the operation.

08:20.582 --> 08:24.252
You promised you wouldn't
bring that up again!

08:24.320 --> 08:26.421
Whether they're boys or
girls, it's beside the point.

08:26.489 --> 08:28.827
- No, it's not beside the point.
- Yeah, but they're living in our house.

08:28.857 --> 08:31.726
Children need boundaries,
and Marty's not setting any.

08:31.794 --> 08:33.799
He lets them stay up as long
as they want every night.

08:33.828 --> 08:35.363
Jill...

08:35.429 --> 08:36.936
He's not setting any limits on what
kind of television they watch.

08:36.966 --> 08:39.337
He's doing the best job he can.
He's going through a separation.

08:39.368 --> 08:41.573
For God's sake, the guy can't be
with his girls on his birthday.

08:41.602 --> 08:44.505
He's counting Snausages.

08:44.573 --> 08:48.042
I know. I feel so sorry for him.
It's awful for him, awful for them.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.010
But at least they get
to spend the day with us.

08:50.146 --> 08:52.418
Well, actually, they're gonna
be spending the day with you.

08:52.448 --> 08:54.115
I gotta go
counsel some patients.

08:54.183 --> 08:56.017
Are you gonna be okay with that?

08:56.085 --> 08:57.518
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

08:57.586 --> 08:59.354
We'll have a good time.

08:59.421 --> 09:02.256
Hey, girls, break open
those piggy banks!

09:02.324 --> 09:05.226
We're going to the casinos
over in Windsor!

09:09.598 --> 09:12.033
Uncle Tim,
are the bikes done yet?

09:12.101 --> 09:14.802
Well, Claire, for me,
"done" is a relative term.

09:14.870 --> 09:16.971
I've been done for
an hour and a half.

09:17.039 --> 09:19.207
When you're done, can I take
it outside and ride it?

09:19.274 --> 09:21.542
No, honey. It's way too
slippery out there today.

09:21.610 --> 09:23.111
But it's my birthday.

09:23.178 --> 09:25.279
I know it's your birthday,
but it's just unsafe.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.680
Please, Uncle Tim?

09:26.748 --> 09:28.049
Not today 'cause it's your...

09:28.117 --> 09:29.484
Please?

09:30.519 --> 09:31.752
Please?

09:38.227 --> 09:39.426
Claire? What are you doing?

09:39.494 --> 09:41.095
Hi, Aunt Jill.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.702
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Who told you
that you could ride your bike in here?

09:43.732 --> 09:45.032
Here I come.

09:46.835 --> 09:48.402
- Tim.
- Hi, honey.

09:48.470 --> 09:51.573
Hop on the handlebars. I'll take
you around the coffee table.

09:51.640 --> 09:54.509
I got a better idea. Why don't we just
flood the basement and swim laps?

09:55.644 --> 09:57.412
- I like it.
- Come here.

09:57.479 --> 09:59.284
It's their birthday. It's their birthday.
Come here.

09:59.314 --> 10:00.634
- Come on.
- We never let our boys

10:00.682 --> 10:03.151
ride bikes in the house,
birthday or no birthday.

10:03.218 --> 10:05.286
Their parents are going
through a separation.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.491
Even more reason
for them to have rules.

10:06.521 --> 10:09.423
They need a grownup
to be in charge.

10:14.263 --> 10:16.103
They're away from their mom
for their birthday.

10:16.165 --> 10:19.400
Their dad is tasting liver
treats for a living.

10:19.468 --> 10:20.740
She sweet-talked you,
didn't she?

10:20.770 --> 10:21.974
She did that thing
where she goes,

10:22.004 --> 10:24.205
"Please, Uncle Tim?"

10:24.273 --> 10:27.942
Actually, she went,
"Uncle Tim, please!"

10:28.010 --> 10:31.412
Girls, I'm sorry, but we can't
ride bikes inside the house.

10:31.480 --> 10:33.047
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:33.115 --> 10:36.417
But Uncle Tim said he'd show
me how to pop a wheelie.

10:36.485 --> 10:37.890
No, no, no, no.
You misunderstood me.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.189
What I said was, "Later on, we'll
put the top on the Healey."

10:42.524 --> 10:44.859
I want to ride my bike.
Please, Uncle Tim?

10:44.927 --> 10:46.895
Oh, come on. One wheelie.

10:46.962 --> 10:49.764
We said no to our boys
hundreds of times.

10:49.832 --> 10:51.465
And look what happened to them.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.467
I don't care what you say.
I'm riding my bike.

10:53.535 --> 10:55.340
No, no, no. We're not gonna
ride in the house anymore.

10:55.370 --> 10:56.541
Aunt Jill doesn't
think it's a good idea.

10:56.571 --> 10:58.272
- I want to ride my bike!
- Claire, no!

10:58.340 --> 10:59.912
- You cannot ride the bike in the house!
- No! I'm riding my bike!

10:59.942 --> 11:01.309
- Claire, stop yelling.
- No!

11:01.376 --> 11:03.410
Hey, I'm home. Where are
the birthday girls?

11:03.478 --> 11:04.678
Daddy! Daddy!

11:04.746 --> 11:07.248
Claire, honey. What's wrong?
Come here.

11:07.316 --> 11:09.683
Aunt Jill's being mean to me.

11:09.751 --> 11:13.621
Oh, sweetie, it's okay.
What's going on?

11:13.689 --> 11:16.424
She wanted to ride her bike
around the house and, uh...

11:16.492 --> 11:18.793
And Jill didn't think
it was a good idea.

11:21.363 --> 11:23.765
You couldn't cut her any
slack on her birthday?

11:23.832 --> 11:25.303
Come on, honey. I'll take
you out for ice cream.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.368
Go get your coat
and your sister, okay?

11:27.436 --> 11:29.203
Come on, Gracie!

11:29.271 --> 11:32.239
Marty, you're setting up
a behavioral pattern

11:32.307 --> 11:34.609
where you give in to her
every time she acts out.

11:34.677 --> 11:36.044
Oh, spare me the psychobabble.

11:36.111 --> 11:37.645
I know how to handle my kids.

11:37.712 --> 11:38.513
If you knew how to
handle your kids,

11:38.647 --> 11:40.415
they'd know how to behave
in our home.

11:40.483 --> 11:43.084
You know, ice cream is starting
to sound real good right now.

11:43.152 --> 11:45.620
Look, Claire and Gracie
need the security of knowing

11:45.687 --> 11:47.655
that there is
a grownup in control.

11:47.723 --> 11:49.495
That's okay. Just don't tell
me how to raise my kids.

11:49.525 --> 11:50.925
How about rocky road?

11:50.993 --> 11:52.698
Or maybe we just shouldn't stay here.
Is that what you're saying?

11:52.728 --> 11:53.799
Oh, that would be great, Marty.

11:53.829 --> 11:55.630
Take the easy way out.
Run away again.

11:55.697 --> 11:57.435
Well, it's pretty obvious that
you don't want us living here.

11:57.465 --> 11:59.004
Oh, no, no. You're not
gonna pull that on me!

11:59.034 --> 12:00.501
I love having you guys here!

12:00.569 --> 12:02.503
And we love being here!

12:04.339 --> 12:06.507
And I can feel the love.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.948
Unbelievable.

12:14.015 --> 12:16.054
I don't want them riding bikes in
the house and I'm the bad guy?

12:16.084 --> 12:17.885
Thanks for bailing on me, Tim.

12:17.953 --> 12:20.854
I wasn't bailing on you. I was
acting like a peacekeeper.

12:20.922 --> 12:23.162
They should have your kind of
peacekeeping in the Middle East.

12:23.192 --> 12:27.228
Shooting starts, you send
out for Chunky Monkey.

12:27.296 --> 12:28.633
They were riding bikes
in the house.

12:28.663 --> 12:30.932
They weren't invading
occupied territory.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.967
Look, I agreed to help you
with your brother.

12:33.035 --> 12:34.701
You gotta help me here.

12:34.769 --> 12:36.641
Even if I don't believe
what you're doing is right.

12:36.671 --> 12:37.676
You know what I'm doing
is right.

12:37.706 --> 12:39.010
No, I don't know
that what you're doing...

12:39.040 --> 12:40.345
You just don't
want to take sides.

12:40.375 --> 12:43.177
That's what makes me
a great peacekeeper.

12:43.244 --> 12:45.179
No, that makes you wishy-washy.

12:45.247 --> 12:47.214
I think maybe you better
back off a little bit.

12:47.282 --> 12:49.655
Okay, okay. I'll back off if I
know that I've got your support

12:49.685 --> 12:51.423
if things get, you know,
completely out of control.

12:51.453 --> 12:54.489
If things get completely out of
control, you have my support 110%.

12:54.623 --> 12:57.458
How do you define
"completely out of control"?

12:59.161 --> 13:01.162
I can't define it.

13:01.230 --> 13:03.197
I'll know it when I
have to clean it up.

13:07.136 --> 13:10.004
Look. There's a gross,
gooey prize in the box.

13:10.072 --> 13:12.706
I want the prize!

13:12.774 --> 13:14.179
Honey, it's gonna be
a lot deeper than that.

13:14.209 --> 13:16.444
They always put the prize
at the bottom.

13:16.511 --> 13:18.712
Whoa, whoa,
I was gonna eat that cereal.

13:18.847 --> 13:19.885
Take your arm
out of the cereal, please.

13:19.915 --> 13:21.683
But I want the prize.

13:21.750 --> 13:22.854
Come on, Tim.
It's not that big a deal.

13:22.884 --> 13:24.319
It's a big deal to me.

13:24.386 --> 13:26.224
Claire, please take your arm
out of the cereal.

13:26.254 --> 13:29.357
Okay, fine. Claire, get your
hand out of the box. Let's go.

13:30.192 --> 13:31.826
Oh, come on, Marty. Claire!

13:31.893 --> 13:33.494
Claire! What...

13:33.562 --> 13:35.033
I want her to
clean this up right now.

13:35.063 --> 13:36.597
Oh, come on.

13:36.665 --> 13:39.438
This wouldn't have happened if you'd
just let her have the stupid prize.

13:39.468 --> 13:41.502
This is my fault?
Claire, clean this up.

13:41.570 --> 13:42.808
I just... I don't have
time to deal with this.

13:42.838 --> 13:45.206
Sorry. I gotta go to work.
They gotta go to school.

13:45.274 --> 13:47.108
Kids, get your things. Let's go.

13:47.176 --> 13:48.914
Why don't you just leave it
here on the table then, huh?

13:48.944 --> 13:51.578
I'll pour some milk on it
and I'll suck it off later.

13:53.082 --> 13:54.214
Bye, girls.

13:59.153 --> 14:01.355
So, Mr. Peacekeeper,

14:02.957 --> 14:06.193
does this qualify
as completely out of control?

14:06.261 --> 14:07.929
Not if I get you to clean it up.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.333
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Marty Taylor.

14:13.401 --> 14:14.802
He's stacking kibble somewhere.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.971
He's been promoted
to squeakies and chew toys

14:17.039 --> 14:20.875
instead of me, who's been here 15
years, but hey, I'm not bitter.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.214
Oh, no. Look, I don't
have time to talk, okay?

14:27.282 --> 14:28.582
I'm way behind in my work.

14:28.651 --> 14:30.618
Do you have time to talk
if I give you a hand?

14:30.686 --> 14:33.387
Like you can learn
this job in one day.

14:36.759 --> 14:38.960
Squeeze the toy,
see if it works.

14:42.497 --> 14:44.637
Look, I know your kids are having
a tough time with the separation,

14:44.667 --> 14:46.605
but you're letting them get
away with murder, Marty.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.740
Hey, you're the one
that told them

14:47.770 --> 14:49.407
they could ride their bikes
around the house!

14:49.437 --> 14:51.272
That's because Claire pouted.
I gave in.

14:51.339 --> 14:53.841
But you give in every time
she snaps her fingers.

14:53.909 --> 14:56.115
Oh, give me a break. The
separation's really hard on them.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.313
- I know. I know. I know.
- I happen to want my kids to like me.

14:59.381 --> 15:01.482
You're their father,
not their friend.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.517
You can't let them
manipulate you like this.

15:06.354 --> 15:08.089
Well, excuse me,
but I happen to think

15:08.157 --> 15:10.925
that you're the one
who's being manipulated.

15:12.795 --> 15:14.095
What's that supposed to mean?

15:14.163 --> 15:15.429
Oh, come on.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.431
Your wife sent you down
here to bite my head off

15:17.499 --> 15:21.302
about something
that you don't even believe.

15:21.369 --> 15:22.737
If you think for one minute

15:22.805 --> 15:24.209
I came down here 'cause of
Jill, you're dead wrong.

15:24.239 --> 15:26.774
I'm my own man.
I do my own bidding.

15:29.411 --> 15:30.578
Hey!

15:31.680 --> 15:33.114
Yeah? Well, I'm my own man

15:33.182 --> 15:36.584
and I don't happen to agree
with what your wife

15:36.651 --> 15:38.485
sent you down here to tell me.

15:38.553 --> 15:41.388
If you weren't such a thickhead,
you'd realize she made a good point.

15:41.456 --> 15:44.658
You know what else?
This is a really annoying job.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.697
It wasn't nearly so annoying

15:49.765 --> 15:52.433
before you came down here and
started breathing down my neck.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.868
Maybe it's time I left, huh?

15:55.537 --> 15:56.971
Oh, now you're doing it?

15:57.039 --> 16:00.041
Who's a guy gotta sleep with
around here to squeak toys?

16:07.415 --> 16:09.583
Well, hi ho, neighbor.

16:09.651 --> 16:12.386
Hidey ho back at you.

16:12.454 --> 16:14.822
You getting ready
to knock off a liquor store?

16:16.725 --> 16:19.460
No, Tim. I'm experimenting
with thermal headgear

16:19.527 --> 16:21.629
for my heli-skiing trip.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.333
Well, I'd rather go skiing
in hell with you

16:26.401 --> 16:28.302
than stay in this house
with my brother.

16:28.370 --> 16:31.305
Oh, I didn't think it was Marty
who was doing all the screaming.

16:31.373 --> 16:32.807
No, it was Claire.

16:32.875 --> 16:35.042
That girl screams
louder than Al's mom

16:35.110 --> 16:37.912
when you try to
take away her pudding.

16:37.979 --> 16:41.215
Well, have you and Jill tried
to deal with the situation?

16:41.282 --> 16:43.951
Of course I tried to talk to him.
It doesn't do any good.

16:44.019 --> 16:45.352
Well, what'd you say to him?

16:45.554 --> 16:47.655
I told him everything
he was doing was wrong.

16:47.723 --> 16:50.792
Oh, golly! And Marty
wasn't responsive to that?

16:52.060 --> 16:53.594
It's impossible to talk to him.

16:53.661 --> 16:55.800
You know, I want to help him, but
I'm running out of speeches.

16:55.830 --> 16:58.565
Well, you know, Tim, as someone whose
first impulse is to speechify,

16:58.633 --> 17:01.902
I can promise you that isn't
always the best solution.

17:01.970 --> 17:05.039
I know how to get his
attention, an atomic wedgie.

17:07.575 --> 17:09.443
Well, you could also
try it my way.

17:09.511 --> 17:11.813
You know, sometimes, Tim,
instead of sharing my wisdom,

17:11.880 --> 17:15.249
I try to give people
the benefit of my experience.

17:15.317 --> 17:18.051
What experience of mine
would be helpful to Marty?

17:18.119 --> 17:21.222
Tim, you have helped raise
three terrific kids.

17:21.289 --> 17:24.826
What good would it be to tell
Marty how I raised my kids?

17:24.893 --> 17:29.063
Well, don't tell him how you did
it, just find a way to show him.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.736
I can't even imagine
what he's going through,

17:30.766 --> 17:32.299
doing all this parenting alone.

17:32.367 --> 17:35.469
I mean, without Jill,
I couldn't have had the kids.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.175
I want a cookie!

17:41.243 --> 17:42.709
Claire, no!

17:42.778 --> 17:43.811
How's it going, Marty?

17:43.879 --> 17:45.112
I hate you!

17:45.180 --> 17:46.380
That answer your question?

17:46.448 --> 17:47.381
I want a cookie!

17:47.449 --> 17:49.016
I told you not before dinner!

17:49.083 --> 17:50.150
Now, you're in time-out!

17:50.218 --> 17:51.218
Go to your room!

17:51.286 --> 17:53.053
- No!
- I said yes!

17:53.121 --> 17:54.922
- No!
- I said yes!

17:54.989 --> 17:56.890
I want to be with Mommy!

17:58.560 --> 18:00.961
Hey, Marty. You're doing good.

18:01.029 --> 18:02.996
Just hang tough, buddy.
You'll be all right.

18:03.064 --> 18:07.702
I said I wanna be with Mommy!

18:08.837 --> 18:11.305
That's it. Time-out's over.
I'm going up there.

18:11.373 --> 18:12.977
Hold on a second.
I'll show you what to do.

18:13.007 --> 18:15.246
Take the cookie. Break it in half.
Right now. Break it in half.

18:15.276 --> 18:16.444
Put half in your mouth.

18:16.511 --> 18:17.611
Give me the other half.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.416
Now what?

18:22.484 --> 18:24.556
Now we go to Legoland and
build a bait and tackle shop

18:24.586 --> 18:26.420
and forget about this.
Come on, come on.

18:26.488 --> 18:29.757
All I want is
that dumb, old cookie!

18:30.925 --> 18:32.926
She's gonna hate me
for the rest of my life.

18:32.994 --> 18:36.096
I'll be surprised if in an hour
she still hates you, okay?

18:36.164 --> 18:38.733
Now, I need a worm cooler,
all right? Start on that.

18:41.403 --> 18:44.037
I hate it here so much!

18:44.105 --> 18:45.873
What's going on?

18:45.940 --> 18:49.543
We're building a bait and tackle
shop during an air-raid siren.

18:51.546 --> 18:52.880
I'm holding my breath!

18:52.947 --> 18:55.115
We're waiting out
Claire's tantrum.

18:55.183 --> 18:57.317
Marty, that is so good.

18:57.386 --> 19:02.222
This room is stupid!
This house is stupid!

19:02.424 --> 19:07.494
Everyone here is stupid,
stupid, stupid, stupid!

19:10.531 --> 19:12.432
It's a dream come true.

19:17.472 --> 19:20.974
You know, she's been at it for over
an hour. Something's gotta blow.

19:21.042 --> 19:23.177
Either her lungs or my eardrums.

19:23.244 --> 19:26.180
You just gotta tune it out. I
barely even hear her anymore.

19:30.786 --> 19:33.621
I heard that one.

19:33.689 --> 19:35.889
You know, I was never any good
at disciplining the kids.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.526
Nancy was always the one
that had to tell them no.

19:38.593 --> 19:40.299
You know, every time they'd
start to cry, I'd just...

19:40.329 --> 19:42.129
Wait, wait, wait. Listen.

19:42.197 --> 19:43.964
She stopped.

19:44.032 --> 19:46.934
-Should I go up there?
- No, no, careful. It might be a trap.

19:49.204 --> 19:50.938
Hi.

19:51.005 --> 19:52.473
- Hi, Claire.
- Hi, Claire.

19:52.541 --> 19:54.842
Hi, honey.

19:54.909 --> 19:56.677
Dad, since I missed dinner,

19:56.745 --> 19:59.246
can I please have
a peanut-butter sandwich?

20:00.682 --> 20:01.682
Sure.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.750
Okay.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.085
Okay.

20:06.355 --> 20:08.188
You made it.

20:08.256 --> 20:10.023
Thanks. I guess I did.

20:11.526 --> 20:14.328
Hey, while I'm up,
can I get you anything?

20:14.396 --> 20:16.731
Yeah. I'd love a cup of tea.
That'd be great.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.400
I could go for a peanut-butter
sandwich myself.

20:21.569 --> 20:23.203
Please!

20:25.106 --> 20:27.240
Please!

20:33.481 --> 20:35.448
It's all finished.

20:35.516 --> 20:37.184
It's the first
bait and tackle shop

20:37.251 --> 20:38.731
with its built-in
lingerie department.

20:38.787 --> 20:40.020
Huh.

20:40.088 --> 20:42.455
And a little Tyra Banks
out of Lego.

20:44.926 --> 20:47.161
Gosh, it's so quiet.

20:47.228 --> 20:49.997
I'm really proud of Marty
for getting through this.

20:50.065 --> 20:51.985
We're just lucky our boys
are through that phase.

20:54.102 --> 20:55.740
You know, I hate living in this house.
I mean, thanks to you guys,

20:55.770 --> 20:58.043
I'm cramped in a stupid little
basement with my geeky brother,

20:58.073 --> 21:00.341
I've got no privacy,
I've got no ventilation

21:00.409 --> 21:01.913
and last night,

21:45.553 --> 21:48.473
Yeah. Well, I'm my own man and I don't
happen to agree with what your wife

21:49.758 --> 21:52.159
sent you down here to say to me.

21:55.530 --> 21:57.431
If you weren't so...

21:58.866 --> 22:00.133
If you weren't so thickheaded,

22:00.201 --> 22:02.403
