WEBVTT

00:08.496 --> 00:10.213
So, how big's the batch?

00:10.248 --> 00:12.198
Should be about 50 pounds,
give or take.

00:12.216 --> 00:14.134
Uncle Jack, that mask...

00:14.168 --> 00:16.419
I think you should...

00:16.470 --> 00:19.723
Mr. White says the fumes
aren't good to breathe.

00:19.757 --> 00:21.558
Let me worry about
what I breathe, kid.

00:21.592 --> 00:24.043
Just hurry this up
so I can grab a smoke.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

01:01.800 --> 01:04.768
76%.

01:04.803 --> 01:06.770
- Nice going, nephew.
- Thanks, Uncle Jack.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.255
Where is the blue?

01:08.273 --> 01:09.756
Where's the what?

01:09.774 --> 01:11.258
The blue color.

01:11.276 --> 01:13.894
Does it come later,
when this hardens?

01:13.928 --> 01:15.929
Where is it?

01:16.981 --> 01:20.701
I am correct in assuming
this should be blue?

01:20.735 --> 01:23.704
See, I'm thinking the headline
here should be "76%."

01:23.738 --> 01:25.956
Yeah. Whole lot more
than it was.

01:25.990 --> 01:28.742
That dude who looked like Wolverine...
he couldn't crack 70.

01:28.776 --> 01:30.127
Fine. Yes,

01:30.161 --> 01:33.247
percentage-wise,
it's marginally improved.

01:33.281 --> 01:34.915
And congratulations, Todd.

01:34.949 --> 01:37.617
But blue is our brand.
All over Europe,

01:37.635 --> 01:40.170
it's what our buyers
pay top dollar for.

01:40.221 --> 01:42.840
If we're down a bit in purity
from the Heisenberg days,

01:42.891 --> 01:44.842
maybe they'll let us
slide on that,

01:44.893 --> 01:47.261
but not if it's not blue.

01:49.981 --> 01:51.431
I don't know.
To my eye,

01:51.465 --> 01:53.100
it's kind of blue.

01:53.134 --> 01:54.601
Yeah, a little.

01:54.635 --> 01:56.403
It's blue-ish.

01:59.023 --> 02:01.775
Todd, you're the chef.
What do you think?

02:06.999 --> 02:09.166
Yeah, kinda...

02:09.199 --> 02:11.201
If it catches the light
just right,

02:11.252 --> 02:14.171
I could see how you'd think

02:14.205 --> 02:16.156
there's a touch of blue,

02:16.174 --> 02:18.425
blue-green in there.

02:18.459 --> 02:19.826
Aquamarine.

02:19.844 --> 02:21.328
Hell, we'll put
food coloring in it.

02:21.346 --> 02:22.963
Make it any damn shade
you want.

02:22.997 --> 02:25.332
- Yeah. Like they do farm-raised salmon.
- Yeah.

02:25.350 --> 02:28.631
Jesus, you ever see how pink
they make that crap?

02:28.666 --> 02:30.601
Like, flamingo pink.

02:31.601 --> 02:33.627
It sure as hell don't come
out the ocean lookin' like that.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.980
All right.
Let's make some money.

02:52.193 --> 02:55.829
- Here you go, Ms. Quayle.
- Lydia.

02:55.863 --> 02:57.697
Thank you.

03:03.838 --> 03:06.339
Is the tea okay?
I made it just like you asked.

03:06.374 --> 03:07.407
Mm-hmm.

03:07.425 --> 03:09.409
You sure?
If it's too weak or something,

03:09.427 --> 03:11.545
I can go put another bag in it.

03:11.579 --> 03:13.513
I'm sure.

03:15.516 --> 03:18.135
Look, about the product...

03:18.186 --> 03:20.771
I'm really sorry
about the color.

03:20.805 --> 03:23.756
For a minute or two,
it just got a few degrees too hot

03:23.775 --> 03:25.692
in the mixing kettle, I think.

03:25.726 --> 03:28.779
I might've just cooked the
color right out of it.

03:28.813 --> 03:32.065
You burned it, like a cake.

03:33.951 --> 03:36.203
Yeah, sort of, I guess.

03:36.237 --> 03:38.205
But the point is
I think I can fix it,

03:38.239 --> 03:41.708
and I think I can bring
the purity up too.

03:41.742 --> 03:43.776
I mean, I'm doing everything

03:43.795 --> 03:46.997
just like Mr. White
taught me, so...

03:47.048 --> 03:50.584
You know,
it's bound to get better, right?

03:50.618 --> 03:53.220
I appreciate you making
every possible effort,

03:53.254 --> 03:54.721
because, as you know,

03:54.755 --> 03:57.290
my buyers expect
a certain threshold,

03:57.308 --> 03:58.725
a continuity.

03:58.759 --> 04:00.977
Yeah. Yeah. Totally.

04:07.635 --> 04:09.135
Uh, about your buyers...

04:10.638 --> 04:14.574
I could ask my uncle
to smooth things over with them,

04:15.576 --> 04:19.161
if... you want.

04:21.249 --> 04:24.784
I'll pass. Thanks.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.588
I've put a lot of faith
in your abilities, Todd.

04:28.623 --> 04:31.491
I believe in you.

04:31.509 --> 04:34.327
Please do make the cook better.

04:34.345 --> 04:37.097
It's very important to me.

04:42.053 --> 04:44.437
I've got a flight to catch.

05:15.052 --> 05:15.886
Hello.

05:16.137 --> 05:18.088
<i>Hey. It's Walt.</i>

05:18.139 --> 05:19.756
Hey, Mr. White.
How you doing?

05:19.807 --> 05:21.308
<i>I'm okay.</i>

05:21.342 --> 05:23.059
<i>I, uh...</i>

05:23.094 --> 05:26.062
<i>Todd, I think I might have</i>

05:26.097 --> 05:28.098
<i>another job for your uncle.</i>

05:28.149 --> 05:31.151
Oh, okay. Uh, you want me
to set up a meeting?

05:31.185 --> 05:34.487
<i>I... Yes. Please.
Let's do that.</i>

05:34.522 --> 05:37.908
Any heads-up
I should give him, like, um,

05:37.942 --> 05:41.561
which jail, how many targets,
stuff like that?

05:43.497 --> 05:45.448
- Mr. White?
<i>- Just one target.</i>

05:45.499 --> 05:48.118
<i>Not currently in jail.</i>

05:48.169 --> 05:50.253
<i>Jesse Pinkman.</i>

05:50.288 --> 05:52.923
You got it.

06:49.349 --> 06:51.258
I'm surprised
you didn't strangle him.

06:51.351 --> 06:53.219
So, now what? Book him?

06:53.237 --> 06:56.388
I'm sure the AUSA have plenty to say
on how to play him against Walt.

06:56.406 --> 06:59.525
Knowing what we know about how
Walt deals with rats behind bars? No...

06:59.560 --> 07:01.727
Yeah. Punk has to be safer
with the Marshals watching his back

07:01.745 --> 07:04.139
than out here
where it's open season.

07:04.140 --> 07:05.635
Mmmh...

07:05.670 --> 07:07.233
What does that mean?
What are you thinking?

07:08.180 --> 07:09.835
Kid's got an idea.

07:09.870 --> 07:12.255
What kid? That kid?
Timmy Dipshit there?

07:12.289 --> 07:14.924
The one that screwed up our sting?
Oh, I'm all ears.

07:14.958 --> 07:17.243
Just, uh, hear him out,
will ya?

07:24.718 --> 07:27.436
Okay, genius, what's the idea?

07:27.471 --> 07:30.439
You guys need evidence
to put him away,

07:30.474 --> 07:33.276
only he's too smart
to leave any out there, right?

07:33.310 --> 07:34.777
So you say.

07:34.811 --> 07:36.779
Well, I know some evidence

07:36.813 --> 07:39.365
that greedy asshole
would never destroy.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.401
His money.

07:42.435 --> 07:44.770
- You know where he keeps his money?
- No.

07:44.788 --> 07:47.573
But I know someone who might.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.414
Oh, hey.
How'd it go?

07:55.448 --> 07:58.551
Trailed him out to the dog house,
picked him up there.

07:58.585 --> 08:00.753
Seemed to be looking
for someone.

08:00.787 --> 08:02.255
Had a lot of questions.

08:02.289 --> 08:04.257
No calls, though, right?
You got his phone?

08:04.291 --> 08:05.508
Yeah.

08:07.678 --> 08:09.312
He's on ice?

08:09.346 --> 08:11.130
The safe house off Rio Bravo.

08:11.148 --> 08:13.232
I got Van Oster
babysitting him.

08:13.267 --> 08:16.468
Yeah, and what about Van Oster?
Did he have any questions?

08:16.486 --> 08:18.938
Probably, but he knows better
than to ask.

08:18.972 --> 08:20.273
Good job.

08:20.307 --> 08:22.408
I gotta tell you this
up front, Hank.

08:22.442 --> 08:24.660
If this guy decides
that he wants to lawyer up,

08:24.695 --> 08:26.329
I don't care
if you are my boss,

08:26.363 --> 08:28.364
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

08:28.415 --> 08:30.416
He won't lawyer up.

08:45.465 --> 08:47.133
What the hell, man?

08:48.685 --> 08:50.019
Ugh.

09:08.572 --> 09:10.039
You're up.

09:19.800 --> 09:22.134
Hey, there. You mind taking it
outside for a minute?

09:22.169 --> 09:24.503
- No, sir. You got it.
- All right. Thanks.

09:25.538 --> 09:27.706
Huell Babineaux.

09:29.142 --> 09:31.143
Know who I am?

09:32.512 --> 09:34.480
I'll take that as a yes.

09:34.514 --> 09:36.732
Uh, thanks for your patience.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.735
Uh, as, uh, Agent Gomez said,

09:39.770 --> 09:42.104
you're... you're not
under arrest.

09:42.155 --> 09:43.773
Why am I here?

09:43.824 --> 09:46.909
Well, you're here, uh,
for your own protection, sir.

09:46.943 --> 09:48.411
How you figure that?

09:48.445 --> 09:52.164
Well, we both know how dangerous
my brother-in-law can be.

09:56.586 --> 09:58.504
Nice poker face.

09:58.538 --> 10:00.423
Look, uh, relax.

10:00.457 --> 10:03.075
There's not much new you can
tell me about Walter White.

10:03.093 --> 10:05.077
Multiple murders,

10:05.095 --> 10:07.413
uh, ties to a white power
prison gang,

10:07.431 --> 10:10.099
ran the largest meth racket
in the entire Southwest.

10:10.133 --> 10:12.802
I'm not asking,
you're not answering.

10:12.853 --> 10:14.970
Whoop-de-doo.
Let's cut to the chase.

10:15.021 --> 10:17.022
We have a wire on Walt's phone.

10:17.057 --> 10:19.258
We intercepted a call
between him

10:19.276 --> 10:21.944
and a certain Saul Goodman,
esquire.

10:21.978 --> 10:24.613
You know, your employer.

10:24.648 --> 10:27.700
Anyway, in the call, uh, Walt said
that he was going to, quote,

10:27.734 --> 10:30.369
"Take care of one Jesse Pinkman,"
unquote,

10:30.404 --> 10:32.288
and that you were next
on the hit list.

10:32.322 --> 10:33.622
That's why you're here.

10:33.657 --> 10:35.908
Bullshit.
That don't make no sense.

10:35.942 --> 10:38.444
We got the recording.
I can... I can let you hear it.

10:38.462 --> 10:41.080
Your associate, Goodman's fixer...
What's his name?

10:41.114 --> 10:43.382
Some carrottop
named Patrick Kuby.

10:43.417 --> 10:46.051
Boston PD ran him out of
Beantown a few years back.

10:46.086 --> 10:47.619
Came out here for the sunshine.

10:47.637 --> 10:50.890
Yeah. Walt said he was gonna do this
Kuby guy the same way he does you.

10:50.924 --> 10:53.092
In fact,
Kuby's already missing.

10:53.126 --> 10:55.094
Sorry to say,
things are looking grim

10:55.128 --> 10:56.962
for your...
your redheaded buddy.

10:56.980 --> 11:00.466
Believe us, don't believe us.
Suit yourself.

11:00.484 --> 11:02.985
Whatever you do,
I would not call Goodman.

11:03.019 --> 11:04.970
He sold you
down the river big-time.

11:04.988 --> 11:07.907
- The hell you talkin' about?
- Oh, don't take it personally.

11:07.941 --> 11:10.809
Goodman's next on the chopping block
if he doesn't do what White says.

11:10.827 --> 11:13.145
And to be fair,
your, uh, circus clown of a boss

11:13.163 --> 11:15.164
did try to spare you
for all of, what,

11:15.198 --> 11:17.166
about 15 seconds

11:17.200 --> 11:19.151
Before he decided
to help Walt track you down.

11:19.169 --> 11:22.154
You see, Goodman's got
a trace on your phone,

11:22.172 --> 11:23.822
and as soon as you call him,

11:23.840 --> 11:25.824
uh, Walt's gonna find out
where you're hiding out.

11:25.842 --> 11:28.344
And then it's just a matter of time
before you end up like this.

11:30.297 --> 11:32.798
Oh, man. Oh, man.

11:32.832 --> 11:35.384
I swear to God, I didn't know
he was gonna kill the man.

11:35.435 --> 11:37.470
I didn't know he was gonna kill him.
I didn't know.

11:37.504 --> 11:39.004
- Relax.
- I didn't know he was gonna kill him.

11:39.022 --> 11:40.523
If we thought you did,
you'd be in lockup

11:40.557 --> 11:42.057
for conspiracy to commit murder

11:42.108 --> 11:43.642
instead of here,
under our protection.

11:43.676 --> 11:45.644
So just tell us everything
you know about White

11:45.678 --> 11:47.146
so we can get him
before he gets you.

11:47.180 --> 11:49.148
Why would he wanna kill me?

11:49.182 --> 11:51.484
- I ain't do nothin' to him.
- Who knows with this guy?

11:51.518 --> 11:53.619
From what he said to Goodman,
it may have something to do

11:53.653 --> 11:55.287
with him trying
to tie up loose ends

11:55.322 --> 11:57.990
regarding his poisoning
some kid named Brock.

11:59.326 --> 12:02.211
Or maybe it's 'cause you know
where his money is.

12:02.245 --> 12:04.163
I don't know
where his money is.

12:04.197 --> 12:05.664
That ain't what we heard.

12:05.698 --> 12:08.000
Well, you ain't listening
to the people in the know.

12:08.034 --> 12:10.135
Me and Kuby
rented a van for the dude,

12:10.170 --> 12:13.005
loaded his cash up
in a self-storage unit,

12:13.039 --> 12:15.707
handed over the keys
to him at Goodman's.

12:15.725 --> 12:18.060
And who knows
where he took it from there?

12:18.094 --> 12:20.879
A van, huh?
How much money we talking?

12:20.897 --> 12:23.065
Seven barrels' worth.

12:23.099 --> 12:24.650
Seven barrels?

12:26.386 --> 12:28.404
When you...
you say "barrels,"

12:28.438 --> 12:30.406
you mean <i>barrels</i> barrels?

12:30.440 --> 12:32.274
Barrels, man.
You know,

12:32.325 --> 12:35.661
plastic, black,
55-gallon type.

12:35.695 --> 12:37.162
I got 'em at Home Depot.

12:37.197 --> 12:39.832
Filled up every last damn
one of 'em too.

12:40.834 --> 12:43.085
And, uh, where did you
rent the van?

12:43.119 --> 12:44.537
Lariat.

12:44.571 --> 12:47.072
The one on Candelaria
and Monroe.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.910
- Lariat on Candelaria?
- Yeah!

12:51.928 --> 12:53.912
Kuby rented the van.

12:53.930 --> 12:55.631
Mr. White dropped it off.

12:55.682 --> 12:58.100
He had us wash it good
before Kuby took it back.

12:58.134 --> 12:59.685
Wash the rental?
Why?

12:59.719 --> 13:02.521
It was filthy, man,
like he had went off road with it.

13:02.556 --> 13:05.774
After we had hosed it down,
he grabbed a shovel out the back,

13:05.809 --> 13:08.527
handed over the key,
and that was it.

13:08.562 --> 13:09.945
That's all I know.

13:13.266 --> 13:15.651
All right, uh, Mr. Babineaux.

13:16.653 --> 13:18.621
Agent Gomez and I

13:18.655 --> 13:21.290
are going to, uh,
do everything we can

13:21.324 --> 13:23.242
to find the son of a bitch.

13:23.276 --> 13:25.044
Meantime, like I said,
you're free to go.

13:25.078 --> 13:27.630
But if I were you,
I wouldn't take one step out that door.

13:27.664 --> 13:30.299
Right. And
remember, no phone calls.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.084
Oh, almost forgot.

13:32.118 --> 13:34.420
Uh, I took the liberty
of removing the battery

13:34.454 --> 13:36.722
so Walt can't, uh,
track you by GPS.

13:36.756 --> 13:39.642
So don't put that back in.

13:39.676 --> 13:41.927
Agent Van Oster
will stay here with you.

13:41.961 --> 13:44.313
You're in good hands.
He's our best man with a gun.

13:44.347 --> 13:46.632
Uh, however, don't discuss
the case with him,

13:46.650 --> 13:49.301
because the less
you distract him,

13:49.319 --> 13:51.987
the better he can protect you.

13:52.022 --> 13:54.156
How long you gonna be?

13:55.158 --> 13:57.443
As long as it takes
to keep you safe.

14:09.656 --> 14:12.091
So just one guy this time.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.376
Not even in lockup.

14:17.514 --> 14:20.299
Some former partner, Todd says?

14:22.552 --> 14:23.852
Yeah.

14:23.887 --> 14:26.138
So what are we talking,
rat patrol?

14:28.224 --> 14:29.942
"Rat p..."

14:30.944 --> 14:32.561
No, no.

14:32.612 --> 14:35.898
"Rat patrol"?
No. No, he's not a rat.

14:37.183 --> 14:39.184
He's just...

14:40.370 --> 14:43.238
He... he just...

14:43.289 --> 14:45.457
won't listen to reason.

14:45.492 --> 14:47.710
- Okay.
- He's just angry.

14:47.744 --> 14:49.495
He's not a rat.

14:49.529 --> 14:51.530
All right.

14:52.749 --> 14:55.000
Angry, non-rat.
Got it.

14:55.034 --> 14:56.752
How angry we talkin',
by the way?

14:56.803 --> 14:58.704
Like, Hulk angry?

14:58.722 --> 15:03.676
Like, "Rambo James Bond
badass" individual?

15:07.731 --> 15:09.732
Not something
you'd do yourself, huh?

15:11.851 --> 15:13.852
Jesse is like family to me.

15:15.405 --> 15:18.223
Look, I want what you do
to be quick

15:18.241 --> 15:19.891
and painless.

15:19.909 --> 15:21.994
No suffering, no fear.

15:22.028 --> 15:25.164
Bullet to the back of the head.
Something he doesn't see coming.

15:25.198 --> 15:27.082
I respect that.

15:27.117 --> 15:28.784
There's too many savages
out there.

15:28.835 --> 15:30.736
Let's just talk
about the money.

15:30.754 --> 15:32.921
No, we don't want your money.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.175
We want you to cook for us.

15:45.752 --> 15:48.971
You know I'm
out of the business.

15:49.022 --> 15:51.724
Just a couple times
to tutor my nephew here, that's all.

15:51.758 --> 15:54.926
Get him on track
to bringing the purity up.

15:54.944 --> 15:57.596
Get the color right too.

15:57.614 --> 16:00.449
Apparently that blue touch
you put on it...

16:00.483 --> 16:02.901
it's all the craze
with those Slavic types.

16:02.935 --> 16:04.403
So I'm told.

16:04.488 --> 16:07.189
No. Absolutely not.

16:07.241 --> 16:11.110
Look, what was the price
per head last time? I'll triple it.

16:11.144 --> 16:14.614
That's a drop in the bucket compared to
what we aim to earn from the blue stuff.

16:14.648 --> 16:17.316
Don't skimp on family.
That's what I always say.

16:17.334 --> 16:19.035
You want us to do this job?

16:19.086 --> 16:22.038
Do it right?
That's the price.

16:34.167 --> 16:36.135
One cook...

16:36.169 --> 16:38.888
after the job is done.

16:57.857 --> 17:00.025
Time is of the essence.
Do you understand?

17:00.043 --> 17:02.378
We'll do him tonight
if you want.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.413
Just tell me where he is.

17:04.464 --> 17:07.383
I don't know where he is,

17:08.835 --> 17:11.369
but I know how
to flush him out.

17:14.895 --> 17:17.063
You want String Cheese
or Yogurt Squeezers

17:17.097 --> 17:18.565
with your PBJ?

17:18.598 --> 17:20.483
Both.

17:20.534 --> 17:23.486
- I didn't hear you.
- Both, please.

17:28.326 --> 17:30.043
Hold on, honey.

17:32.112 --> 17:33.747
Hi, Andrea.

17:33.781 --> 17:35.465
I don't know
if you remember me.

17:35.499 --> 17:37.717
I'm Walter White,
Jesse's friend.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.803
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course. Hi.

17:39.837 --> 17:41.304
Yeah. Oh, hi. Hi.

17:41.339 --> 17:44.341
I'm sorry to just barge in
on you like this,

17:44.392 --> 17:48.144
but, uh, I was hoping that I could
have a moment to talk with you.

17:48.179 --> 17:50.430
It's about Jesse.

17:50.464 --> 17:53.233
Um, okay. Sure. But I'm sort of
rushing around right now.

17:53.267 --> 17:55.268
You wanna talk inside while
I get my boy ready for school?

17:55.302 --> 17:56.936
Uh, well, yeah.
If it's...

17:56.970 --> 17:58.805
if it's okay, yeah, sure.

17:58.823 --> 18:00.807
Thank you.

18:00.825 --> 18:02.742
You met Brock before, right?

18:02.777 --> 18:05.695
Yes. Yes, I have.
At Jesse's.

18:05.746 --> 18:07.497
How you doing, Brock?

18:10.651 --> 18:12.385
Brock, he asked you a question.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.121
- I'm good.
- Good.

18:15.156 --> 18:17.040
Froot Loops.

18:17.091 --> 18:19.426
That's good stuff.

18:20.711 --> 18:22.228
So... Jesse.

18:22.263 --> 18:23.730
Yeah. I...

18:23.764 --> 18:25.465
I don't wanna alarm you,

18:25.499 --> 18:28.134
but I've... I've been trying
to reach him for days.

18:28.168 --> 18:29.636
I've stopped at his house.

18:29.670 --> 18:32.238
I've left all kinds of messages
on his voicemail,

18:32.273 --> 18:33.740
and he won't return my calls.

18:33.774 --> 18:35.558
I can't find him anywhere.

18:35.609 --> 18:37.510
Have you heard from him?

18:37.528 --> 18:40.012
No, not since the last time
he called to check on Brock.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.531
That was...
I don't know...

18:41.565 --> 18:43.616
two weeks ago, maybe.

18:44.618 --> 18:46.953
Andrea...

18:46.987 --> 18:49.522
Jesse's using again,

18:49.540 --> 18:51.458
and I... I...

18:51.492 --> 18:53.910
I have a bad feeling
about this.

18:55.746 --> 18:57.747
Have you tried
calling the police?

19:00.551 --> 19:02.335
Or, um...
a better idea.

19:02.369 --> 19:05.705
Jesse's lawyer's name is Saul Goodman.
I have his card somewhere.

19:05.723 --> 19:07.507
I mean, he may have ways
of finding Jesse

19:07.541 --> 19:09.225
without, you know,
getting him in trouble.

19:09.260 --> 19:12.595
"Better Call Saul."
Yeah. I... I did that.

19:12.646 --> 19:15.098
He was able to verify
that Jesse's not locked up.

19:15.149 --> 19:19.319
But otherwise,
very little help.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.856
See, the thing is

19:22.890 --> 19:26.109
is that Jesse and I
had this argument recently.

19:26.160 --> 19:29.579
And I... I won't bore you
with the details, but, uh,

19:29.613 --> 19:32.165
he's... he's...

19:32.199 --> 19:36.202
he's pretty upset
with me, and, uh...

19:36.236 --> 19:39.205
and I'm hoping that's the reason
he hasn't called me back

19:39.239 --> 19:41.007
instead of...

19:41.041 --> 19:43.760
him being...

19:43.794 --> 19:45.812
Well...

19:48.716 --> 19:50.750
Well, I'll try him right now.

19:50.768 --> 19:53.636
I mean, if that's it...
he's mad at you,

19:53.687 --> 19:55.305
maybe I'll have better luck.

19:55.356 --> 19:57.607
That would be such a help. Yes.

19:57.641 --> 20:00.760
What, um... what... what number
are you, uh, calling him on?

20:00.778 --> 20:02.946
- Um, his cell.
- Ah. Yeah. You know,

20:03.980 --> 20:05.948
he recently gotten a new one.

20:05.982 --> 20:07.900
And there. That...

20:07.934 --> 20:11.036
that's his new number there...
the highlighted one.

20:15.809 --> 20:18.143
Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.

20:18.178 --> 20:19.645
Your friend Walter
just dropped by.

20:19.679 --> 20:21.680
He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.

20:21.714 --> 20:24.216
We, uh...
we're thinking of you.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.451
Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?

20:26.469 --> 20:28.220
I really need to hear from you.

20:28.254 --> 20:30.305
It's important.

20:31.457 --> 20:33.625
Thank you, Andrea.

20:33.643 --> 20:36.345
I appreciate that.

20:36.396 --> 20:38.680
Well, I better...
I better be going.

20:38.731 --> 20:41.733
Oh, you're welcome to stay a
few minutes to see if he calls back.

20:41.768 --> 20:44.269
No. No, no. You're trying to
get your son off to school.

20:44.303 --> 20:46.688
Listen, if he does happen to
call back, would you call me?

20:46.739 --> 20:47.973
Better yet...

20:47.991 --> 20:51.026
I've got your number.
I'll call you back, okay?

20:51.077 --> 20:53.662
And... thank you.

20:54.664 --> 20:56.281
See ya, Brock.

21:26.029 --> 21:27.512
We on?

21:27.530 --> 21:30.282
Yes. It should be
any time now.

21:30.316 --> 21:32.201
<i>Copy that.</i>

21:32.235 --> 21:35.737
Remember, fast and painless.
And take him away from here.

21:35.788 --> 21:38.757
I don't want the mother
or the boy to know.

21:38.791 --> 21:40.626
<i>You got it.</i>

21:46.332 --> 21:48.333
<i>Jesse, hey, it's Andrea.</i>

21:48.367 --> 21:50.135
<i>Your friend Walter
just dropped by.</i>

21:50.169 --> 21:52.638
<i>He's here at the house
with me and Brock right now.</i>

21:52.672 --> 21:54.706
<i>We, uh...
we're thinking of you.</i>

21:54.724 --> 21:56.875
<i>Call me back as soon as
you get this message, okay?</i>

21:56.893 --> 21:58.677
<i>I really need to hear from you.</i>

21:58.711 --> 22:01.013
<i>It's important.</i>

22:03.766 --> 22:06.068
Nice try, asshole.

22:22.585 --> 22:24.503
How'd it go
at the rental place?

22:24.537 --> 22:26.371
Van have GPS?

22:26.405 --> 22:28.206
No GPS. Nope.

22:28.240 --> 22:31.343
They used to have GPS
until about six months ago,

22:31.377 --> 22:33.929
when the ACLU
or somebody sued them,

22:33.963 --> 22:36.265
and they had to get rid of it.

22:40.320 --> 22:43.722
Well, that's it.
Game over.

22:43.756 --> 22:46.758
Yo, man, you can't
just give up on this.

22:46.776 --> 22:49.394
- Who said we're giving up?
- What do you got?

22:49.428 --> 22:51.763
Just thinking about
what Babineaux said

22:51.781 --> 22:53.264
about the van being dirty

22:53.283 --> 22:55.651
and the shovel
that Walt had with him.

22:55.702 --> 22:58.103
I'll bet you 10-to-1
he buried that money.

22:58.121 --> 23:00.322
No kidding.
So what?

23:00.373 --> 23:02.324
There's a whole lot
of desert out there.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.992
How are we gonna find
the right spot?

23:04.043 --> 23:06.444
You said it yourself,
there's no GPS on the van.

23:06.462 --> 23:09.998
Yeah. But Walt
doesn't know that.

23:12.675 --> 23:14.709
All right.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.045
Here's your change.

23:17.096 --> 23:19.047
- Oh, um, count it out, please.
- Here.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.165
Uh, three.
That makes 15.

23:21.183 --> 23:23.968
Plus five.
That is 20.

23:24.002 --> 23:26.137
Give this to
your car wash professional.

23:26.171 --> 23:27.472
Thank you.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.807
Say it.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.308
Have an A-1 day.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.009
Oh, you too.

23:33.011 --> 23:35.179
- Good.
- Why... why do I...

23:35.197 --> 23:37.148
why do I gotta say that?

23:37.182 --> 23:39.567
Because it reinforces
our brand.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.653
So, getting the hang of it?

23:41.687 --> 23:44.706
It's, uh... it's...
it's pretty basic.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.692
Mom, it's Saturday.

23:47.910 --> 23:49.694
Can... can I go?

23:49.728 --> 23:51.395
- Go where?
- Home.

23:51.413 --> 23:54.866
Um, pick up a few things,
maybe chill for a little bit.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.085
I'm sure the smell
is gone by now.

23:57.119 --> 23:59.921
Why don't you just stick around here
for a while longer, all right?

23:59.955 --> 24:01.873
- I need you.
- Hi.

24:01.907 --> 24:04.008
Uh, who do I give this to?

24:04.043 --> 24:06.010
Um, you know what?
I'll take care of it.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.595
Excuse me, son.

24:07.629 --> 24:09.931
That'll be 14.97, please.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.055
Hey. How you doin'?

24:17.089 --> 24:20.058
Y-you're on our billboard.
You're...

24:20.092 --> 24:22.593
- you're the lawyer guy. Yeah.
- "Better call Saul!"

24:26.598 --> 24:28.983
Okay.

24:29.034 --> 24:33.905
So, three makes 15,
and 20, 25, 30,

24:33.939 --> 24:36.240
35, 40, and ten makes 50.

24:36.274 --> 24:37.575
Thank you.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.494
I like your commercial.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.212
What... what happened
to your face?

24:41.246 --> 24:44.415
Uh, this is a... I guess you'd call it
an occupational hazard.

24:44.449 --> 24:47.284
Okay, so thank you, and please give that
to your car wash professional.

24:47.302 --> 24:49.670
Very good. Thank you very much.
Good to meet you.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.472
- Yeah.
- Don't drink and drive.

24:51.507 --> 24:54.475
But if you do, call me.

24:54.510 --> 24:56.844
Have an A-1 day.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.130
Mom, you, um...
you forgot to say it.

24:59.148 --> 25:01.682
Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay.

25:03.185 --> 25:05.820
Make sure you get in there
between the cushions, all right?

25:05.854 --> 25:09.157
That's it. Way in there.
Attaboy.

25:10.159 --> 25:11.909
What the hell you doing here?

25:11.944 --> 25:14.695
I swear to God, the kid left so much
booger powder in there,

25:14.747 --> 25:16.631
my Caddy is a K-9 unit's
wet dream.

25:16.665 --> 25:19.300
Is your phone broken?
All 200 of them?

25:19.334 --> 25:21.719
Huell's gone.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.638
Huell's gone where?

25:23.672 --> 25:25.590
No idea. AWOL.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.508
Nobody's seen him.
He's not answering his phone.

25:27.559 --> 25:29.460
So what about Jesse?

25:29.478 --> 25:31.462
He hasn't shown up yet.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.098
He will, Saul.
He's probably high as a kite somewhere

25:34.132 --> 25:36.017
and hasn't gotten
our message yet.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.686
Or he got it loud and clear
and figured out it's a setup.

25:38.737 --> 25:41.522
The kid is not as dumb
as you think.

25:47.312 --> 25:50.581
Are you wearing
a bulletproof vest?

25:50.616 --> 25:53.317
Did you miss the part about
my bodyguard has gone missing?

25:53.335 --> 25:56.254
Look, I had him
watching the dog house,

25:56.288 --> 25:58.256
figuring the kid might show up
for a fix.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.424
Next thing I know,
radio silence.

26:00.459 --> 26:02.827
You're the math whiz.
Add up two and two.

26:02.845 --> 26:05.880
Jesse is not on
some killing spree.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.932
It's me he wants.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.667
It's just me.

26:09.685 --> 26:11.502
Then where the hell's Huell?

26:17.359 --> 26:19.477
Any news?

26:19.511 --> 26:21.679
Not yet, but soon.
I promise.

26:21.697 --> 26:24.532
- Have an A-1 day.
- Okay.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.372
Next...

26:31.406 --> 26:34.075
inventory lists.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.141
...uh, ten pine-scented
air fresheners.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.209
You mark "ten"
under this column,

26:52.227 --> 26:54.762
and then you subtract ten from
the actual stock column here.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.714
Okay?
Why don't you try that?

27:07.693 --> 27:08.726
Jesse?

27:08.744 --> 27:10.661
<i>Got my photo, bitch?</i>

27:10.696 --> 27:12.663
<i>That barrel look familiar?</i>

27:12.698 --> 27:15.900
<i>'Cause I just found six more
exactly like it.</i>

27:22.457 --> 27:24.742
<i>That big bastard
who works for Goodman...</i>

27:24.760 --> 27:27.011
<i>I pistol-whipped
that melon he calls a head</i>

27:27.045 --> 27:28.679
<i>till he gave up what he knew,</i>

27:28.714 --> 27:30.548
<i>which led me
to your rental van,</i>

27:30.582 --> 27:32.583
<i>which, it turns out, had GPS.</i>

27:32.601 --> 27:35.102
<i>How do you like that, genius?</i>

27:35.137 --> 27:37.104
<i>Guess you didn't think
of everything.</i>

27:37.139 --> 27:40.391
Look, Jesse, I don't know what
you plan on doing here, but...

27:40.425 --> 27:42.977
<i>Well, I'll give you
a hint, Walt.</i>

27:43.028 --> 27:45.363
<i>It involves a couple
of five-gallon cans</i>

27:45.397 --> 27:47.198
<i>of gasoline and a lighter.</i>

27:47.232 --> 27:49.650
No, no, no, no, no!
Jesse, please, listen to me.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.235
<i>No, you listen to me, bitch!</i>

27:51.269 --> 27:53.604
<i>You get your ass out here
as fast as you can.</i>

27:53.622 --> 27:55.706
Yes, I'm coming!
Okay? Okay!

27:55.741 --> 27:59.210
<i>And don't even think about
calling anyone for help, all right?</i>

27:59.244 --> 28:01.612
<i>You hang up on me,
put me on hold,</i>

28:01.630 --> 28:03.614
<i>I lose my call for any reason,</i>

28:03.632 --> 28:06.584
<i>as soon as you do,
I'm burning all of it.</i>

28:06.618 --> 28:09.136
<i>All right? One big bonfire.
You get the picture?</i>

28:09.171 --> 28:10.805
I get it.
I get it. Okay.

28:10.839 --> 28:12.306
<i>All right.
Well, you better hurry,</i>

28:12.341 --> 28:14.291
<i>'cause I'm burning
ten grand a minute</i>

28:14.309 --> 28:16.460
<i>till you get here,
starting right now.</i>

28:16.478 --> 28:19.313
I said I'm coming!
Don't you touch my money!

28:19.348 --> 28:21.265
<i>Fire in the hole, bitch.</i>

28:21.299 --> 28:23.017
<i>There goes ten G's.</i>

28:23.068 --> 28:26.354
<i>Aw, nice orange flames.</i>
No. No, no, no, no, no!

28:29.641 --> 28:31.475
Jesse... Jesse, please.

28:31.493 --> 28:34.612
I'm dying.
My cancer is back.

28:34.646 --> 28:38.148
You're not hurting anyone
but my family. Okay?

28:38.166 --> 28:40.334
Look, I... I can't
spend this money.

28:40.369 --> 28:43.587
It's not for me.
I won't be around long enough to use it.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.506
It belongs to my children.

28:45.540 --> 28:48.342
<i>Oh, you're gonna
talk about kids.</i>

28:48.377 --> 28:50.044
<i>You're seriously
gonna go there?</i>

28:51.763 --> 28:54.515
I am sorry about Brock.

28:54.517 --> 28:56.467
<i>- No, you're not.</i>
- I am.

28:56.501 --> 28:57.969
<i>You're not,
but you're gonna be.</i>

28:58.003 --> 29:01.171
Yes, I am sorry about Brock!

29:01.189 --> 29:03.107
But he's alive, isn't he?

29:03.141 --> 29:05.893
He's fine,
just as I planned it!

29:05.944 --> 29:08.813
Don't you think I knew
exactly how much to give him?

29:08.847 --> 29:10.815
That I had it all measured out?
Come on!

29:10.849 --> 29:13.367
- Don't you know me by now?
<i>- I know you're a lying,</i>

29:13.402 --> 29:15.853
<i>evil scumbag,
that's what I know.</i>

29:15.871 --> 29:18.873
<i>Manipulating people,</i>

29:18.907 --> 29:20.591
<i>- messing with their heads.</i>
- Open your eyes!

29:20.625 --> 29:24.495
Can't you see that I needed you
on my side to kill Gus?

29:24.529 --> 29:26.914
I ran over those gangbangers!

29:26.965 --> 29:29.717
I killed Emilio
and Krazy-8! Why?

29:29.751 --> 29:32.720
I did all of those things
to try to save your life

29:32.754 --> 29:34.388
as much as mine,

29:34.423 --> 29:36.257
only you're too stupid
to know it!

29:41.096 --> 29:43.180
Jesse...

29:43.214 --> 29:46.050
Jesse!

29:46.068 --> 29:47.735
Jesse, talk to me.

29:49.438 --> 29:51.105
Jesse!

29:56.061 --> 29:58.746
Jesse, I didn't hang up!
Jesse!

30:11.259 --> 30:13.127
Jesse?

30:15.180 --> 30:17.765
Jesse, I'm here.
Where are you?

31:05.764 --> 31:08.132
Son of a bitch.

31:09.518 --> 31:11.652
Son of a bitch.

31:16.441 --> 31:18.442
Son of a bitch!

32:02.737 --> 32:05.856
No. No.
No, no, no.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.944
Come on, come on.

32:43.995 --> 32:46.030
Yes.

32:50.285 --> 32:51.418
Yeah?

32:51.453 --> 32:53.671
It's me.
I've got Jesse in sight,

32:53.705 --> 32:56.090
and he's coming for me
right now.

32:56.124 --> 32:58.709
<i>He knows I'm alone.</i>

32:58.743 --> 33:00.878
<i>I'm guessing he's got backup.</i>

33:00.912 --> 33:03.881
- How many guys?
<i>- I don... I... I don't know.</i>

33:03.915 --> 33:07.327
- Where are you?
<i>- Tohajiilee.</i>

33:07.362 --> 33:09.320
<i>Indian reservation,
west of town.</i>

33:09.355 --> 33:11.438
<i>- Get a pen.</i>
- Go.

33:11.473 --> 33:13.557
Okay.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.228
Okay.

33:17.262 --> 33:20.564
"34, 59, 20,

33:20.598 --> 33:23.901
<i>106, 36, 52."</i>

33:23.935 --> 33:26.787
Those are coordinates.

33:26.821 --> 33:29.156
If you <i> want me around
to cook for you,</i>

33:29.207 --> 33:30.824
- you get here right now.
<i>- You got it.</i>

33:30.875 --> 33:33.443
As fast as you can.
Okay. Wait.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.664
They're coming.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.749
It looks like
there could be three men total.

33:43.638 --> 33:45.289
Wait a minute.

33:45.307 --> 33:47.508
What?
What is it?

33:47.559 --> 33:49.727
Stay in the car.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.868
- Oh, my God.
<i>- Walter, what is it?</i>

33:55.990 --> 33:57.848
<i>Walter, you still there?</i>

34:00.256 --> 34:01.537
<i>Walter!</i>

34:06.404 --> 34:08.456
<i>Walter, you got eyes on him?</i>

34:13.844 --> 34:15.835
<i>What do you see?</i>

34:20.297 --> 34:21.952
<i>Walter, talk to me.</i>

34:22.927 --> 34:24.928
Forget it.

34:26.297 --> 34:28.181
Don't come.

34:28.216 --> 34:29.850
What do you mean, "Don't come"?

34:29.884 --> 34:31.185
<i>It's off.</i>

34:32.687 --> 34:34.737
Do not come.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.583
Walt!

35:02.634 --> 35:04.701
Come on out!

35:07.372 --> 35:09.206
Walt!

35:15.930 --> 35:18.265
Walt!

35:18.316 --> 35:20.684
I know you're out here!

35:25.527 --> 35:27.218
It's over!

35:50.610 --> 35:52.277
Walt!

35:54.781 --> 35:56.882
Come on out, Walt!

36:06.292 --> 36:08.627
Got him.

36:26.663 --> 36:29.048
Drop it!

36:37.540 --> 36:39.225
Hands up!

36:46.182 --> 36:48.717
Walk towards me slowly!

37:22.668 --> 37:24.919
Stop.

37:24.970 --> 37:26.971
Turn around.

37:32.061 --> 37:34.929
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

37:37.433 --> 37:39.550
Walk backwards to me.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.440
Stop.

37:45.491 --> 37:47.408
Get on your knees.

38:19.925 --> 38:22.927
How'd you like
my barrel photo, huh?

38:22.945 --> 38:25.613
Took it in the backyard
by the barbecue grill.

38:25.647 --> 38:29.283
You know, where we used to
cook out with the family.

38:29.318 --> 38:32.570
Gomie thought the dirt
might not match. But me?

38:32.604 --> 38:34.605
I bet your greedy ass
would be so worked up

38:34.623 --> 38:36.657
about the prospect
of losing your cash

38:36.709 --> 38:38.710
that you wouldn't catch it.

38:39.962 --> 38:41.946
Looks like I was right.

38:41.964 --> 38:43.915
He's clean.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.652
Yo, I remember this place.

38:47.686 --> 38:51.255
The very first place
we cooked, like, ever.

38:52.508 --> 38:56.094
It is, isn't it?

38:56.128 --> 38:59.630
Hey, uh, what say
you save us the busywork, Walt,

38:59.648 --> 39:03.601
and point out the spot
where you buried your money?

39:07.472 --> 39:09.473
No?

39:09.491 --> 39:11.409
No matter.

39:11.443 --> 39:14.529
I'll get a search team out here.
We'll find it.

39:17.166 --> 39:20.168
Agent Gomez,
shall we flip a coin for the honors?

39:20.202 --> 39:22.203
No way, man.
It's all yours.

39:22.254 --> 39:23.320
All right.

39:24.540 --> 39:26.457
Walter White,

39:26.491 --> 39:28.492
you have the right
to remain silent.

39:28.510 --> 39:31.379
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

39:31.430 --> 39:32.797
in a court of law.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.715
You have the right
to speak to an attorney

39:34.767 --> 39:36.634
and have an attorney present
during any questioning.

39:36.668 --> 39:38.886
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

39:38.937 --> 39:41.389
one will be provided for you
at the government's expense.

39:41.440 --> 39:45.526
Do you understand these rights
as I have just recited them to you?

39:46.979 --> 39:48.646
Coward.

40:05.047 --> 40:06.914
Back off! Back off!

40:06.965 --> 40:08.332
Get over here!
Get over here!

40:08.366 --> 40:10.835
- Get in the truck!
- Bring it, bitch!

40:10.869 --> 40:12.753
- Put him in the car!
- Come on!

40:12.805 --> 40:15.223
Get in the car!
Hurry up! Get in.

40:18.543 --> 40:21.012
Get in the car, kid.
Come on.

40:30.489 --> 40:32.556
Gonna take him down
for booking, okay?

40:32.574 --> 40:35.359
I think you should stay here
till I come back with a search team.

40:35.393 --> 40:37.361
You got it.
I'd take the kid with me,

40:37.395 --> 40:39.914
but they'd probably
kill each other on the way.

40:41.450 --> 40:44.931
- Congratulations, buddy.
- Hey.

40:48.674 --> 40:51.425
I'll call the Tribal Police on the way out,
let 'em know we're here.

40:51.460 --> 40:54.078
Gonna make a phone call.

41:09.862 --> 41:14.165
Hank, why is there what looks
like brains in our garbage can?

41:14.199 --> 41:16.450
Hey, baby. I got him.

41:16.485 --> 41:18.152
Dead to rights.

41:19.454 --> 41:21.205
You got Walt?

41:21.240 --> 41:22.540
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:22.574 --> 41:25.376
<i>I got him in handcuffs
as we speak.</i>

41:25.410 --> 41:29.163
<i>Want me to wave to him
for you? Huh?</i>

41:32.134 --> 41:34.552
Well, he's not, uh...

41:34.586 --> 41:36.587
he's not feeling too friendly.

41:36.621 --> 41:39.623
Oh, my God.

41:39.641 --> 41:42.260
You did it.

41:42.294 --> 41:43.928
Thank God.

41:43.962 --> 41:45.646
<i>Things are gonna be</i>

41:45.681 --> 41:49.200
a little rough for the next couple weeks,
but they'll get better.

41:53.989 --> 41:55.656
Baby, you okay?

41:58.193 --> 42:00.361
I'm much better now.

42:03.081 --> 42:05.116
I gotta go.

42:05.150 --> 42:07.151
It may be awhile
before I get home.

42:11.323 --> 42:13.007
I love you.

42:14.209 --> 42:16.210
I love you too.

42:45.407 --> 42:47.375
Who the hell is this?

42:47.409 --> 42:49.410
Tribal Police?

42:51.713 --> 42:55.166
Hank! Hank! Hank!

43:12.583 --> 43:13.934
No...

43:22.244 --> 43:24.728
Police!
Drop your weapons!

43:24.746 --> 43:28.082
Jack, don't do it!

43:28.116 --> 43:29.700
Jack!

43:32.404 --> 43:35.456
Drop... your... weapons!

43:35.507 --> 43:37.758
You heard the man!
Put 'em down!

43:37.793 --> 43:40.744
How do we know you're cops?

43:40.762 --> 43:42.880
Show us some ID!

43:42.914 --> 43:46.801
Damn straight!
Let's see some badges!

43:46.852 --> 43:48.469
Jack!

43:48.520 --> 43:51.588
Jack, don't do it!
Jack!

43:52.724 --> 43:56.394
No, Jack! It's off!
Jack!

43:56.428 --> 43:59.480
We'll give ourselves up
if you show us some badges!

44:02.284 --> 44:04.285
Simple as that!

44:05.620 --> 44:07.621
How 'bout it?

44:07.656 --> 44:09.490
No!

44:10.542 --> 44:14.128
Jack!
