13:52.710 --> 13:55.460
Everything is so clever, so tricky―

13:55.550 --> 13:57.510
Just like their King Bumi.

13:57.590 --> 13:58.930
What do you want to do, sir?

14:05.430 --> 14:07.350
What an exquisite performance.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.560
I can't wait to see

14:08.640 --> 14:10.230
how you'll top yourself tomorrow.

14:10.440 --> 14:11.440
I'm sorry, Azula,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.980
but unfortunately there
won't be a show tomorrow.

14:14.070 --> 14:15.110
Really?

14:15.780 --> 14:17.900
The universe is giving
me strong hints

14:17.990 --> 14:19.700
that it's time for a career change.

14:20.570 --> 14:22.240
I want to join you on your mission.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.580
( COOING )

14:34.050 --> 14:36.170
No! Bad Fire Nation baby.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.300
Waah!

14:39.930 --> 14:41.140
Oh, all right.

14:43.010 --> 14:44.930
( COOING )

14:46.020 --> 14:47.770
Oh, you're so cute!

14:47.850 --> 14:48.850
Ooh!

14:48.930 --> 14:50.440
Sure, he's cute now.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.060
But when he's older,
he'll join the Fire Nation army.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.110
You won't think he's so cute then.

14:55.190 --> 14:56.980
He'll be a killer.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.570
Does that look like
the face of a killer to you?

15:01.780 --> 15:03.620
( SQUAWKING )

15:05.160 --> 15:06.540
A messenger hawk.

15:08.580 --> 15:10.540
AANG: It's from the Fire Nation governor.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.960
He thinks we kidnapped his son.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.090
So, he wants to make a trade.

15:15.590 --> 15:16.630
His son...

15:16.710 --> 15:18.130
For King Bumi!

15:28.140 --> 15:30.980
SOKKA: You realize
we're probably walking right into a trap.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.100
I don't think so.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.400
I'm sure the governor wants his son back

15:34.480 --> 15:35.900
as much as we want Bumi.

15:35.980 --> 15:37.070
It's a new day.

15:37.440 --> 15:39.110
I have a good feeling about this.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.000
Please tell me you're
here to kill me.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.790
( CHUCKLES )

15:53.870 --> 15:55.380
It's great to see you, Mai.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.630
I thought you ran off
and joined the circus.

15:58.710 --> 16:00.130
You said it was your calling.

16:00.510 --> 16:03.380
Well, Azula called a little louder.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.760
I have a mission,

16:04.840 --> 16:06.260
and I need you both.

16:06.350 --> 16:07.350
Count me in.

16:07.810 --> 16:09.850
Anything to get me
out of this place.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.180
GOVERNOR: I apologize.

16:12.850 --> 16:15.020
You've come to Omashu at a difficult time.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.020
At noon, we're making a trade

16:17.110 --> 16:19.440
with the resistance to get Tom-Tom back.

16:19.530 --> 16:22.570
Yes, I'm so sorry to
hear about your son.

16:22.650 --> 16:24.570
But, really, what did you expect

16:24.660 --> 16:27.320
by just letting all the citizens leave?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.410
My father has trusted you with this city,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.200
and you're making a mess of things.

16:32.290 --> 16:33.620
Forgive me, Princess.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.460
You stay here.

16:35.540 --> 16:37.130
Mai will handle the hostage trade

16:37.210 --> 16:39.210
so you don't have a chance to mess it up.

16:39.630 --> 16:41.300
AZULA: <i>And there is no more Omashu.</i>

16:41.380 --> 16:43.630
<i>I am renaming it
in honor of my father.</i>

16:43.760 --> 16:45.930
The city of New Ozai!

16:58.610 --> 16:59.610
( CHUCKLING )

17:01.440 --> 17:03.360
Hi, everybody!

17:05.950 --> 17:07.280
You brought my brother?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.490
AANG: He's here.

17:09.120 --> 17:10.530
We're ready to trade.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.370
I'm sorry, but a thought
just occurred to me.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.540
Do you mind?

17:14.620 --> 17:16.580
Of course not, Princess Azula.

17:16.670 --> 17:19.290
We're trading a two-year-old for a king―

17:19.380 --> 17:21.920
A powerful earthbending king.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.670
It just doesn't seem like a fair trade.

17:24.760 --> 17:25.760
Does it?

17:29.180 --> 17:30.180
You're right.

17:32.890 --> 17:34.140
The deal's off.

17:34.230 --> 17:35.390
Whoa!

17:36.020 --> 17:37.230
See you all later!

17:37.690 --> 17:39.190
( SNORT ) Ha ha ha.

17:39.690 --> 17:42.070
AANG: Bumi!

17:42.150 --> 17:43.570
( GRUNTS )

17:47.570 --> 17:48.570
( GRUNTS )

17:48.660 --> 17:50.070
The Avatar.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.950
My lucky day.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.130
Aang! Is that you?

18:02.210 --> 18:03.840
Where did you
come from?

18:04.210 --> 18:06.760
Hang on. We're gonna get you out of here.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.520
We've gotta get the baby out of here!

18:17.480 --> 18:19.100
Way ahead of you.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.820
( GRUNTING )

18:39.120 --> 18:40.120
( SCREAMS )

18:46.090 --> 18:48.510
Aang! Stop your blowing for a minute.

18:52.510 --> 18:53.510
( GROWLING )

18:53.640 --> 18:54.930
BUMI: Now hold on just a―

18:55.010 --> 18:56.640
Aagh!

19:12.110 --> 19:13.200
( LAUGHING )

19:13.280 --> 19:14.490
It's just like old times,

19:14.580 --> 19:15.580
Isn't it, Bumi?

19:15.660 --> 19:17.830
Aang, I need to talk to you!

19:17.910 --> 19:19.620
It's good to see you, too!

19:32.220 --> 19:33.220
Aagh!

19:50.070 --> 19:51.320
Phew!

19:52.860 --> 19:53.860
Aagh!

20:03.460 --> 20:04.460
( GRUNTS )

20:08.250 --> 20:10.380
( GRUNTING )

20:16.970 --> 20:19.220
How are you gonna fight
without your bending?

20:20.270 --> 20:21.390
( GASPS )

20:21.480 --> 20:22.560
( GRUNTS )

20:22.890 --> 20:23.940
I seem to manage!

20:27.150 --> 20:28.770
( SCREAMS )

20:31.530 --> 20:32.610
There's Aang!

20:32.690 --> 20:33.860
We can catch him!

20:38.870 --> 20:40.080
Hang on, Bumi!

20:40.160 --> 20:41.370
Our ride's here!

20:45.460 --> 20:46.540
( GRUNTING )

20:47.130 --> 20:48.460
Aang!

20:51.550 --> 20:52.800
Oof!

20:57.850 --> 20:58.850
( GRUNTS )

21:17.780 --> 21:18.870
You could earthbend...

21:19.240 --> 21:20.410
All along?!

21:20.530 --> 21:22.660
Well, they didn't cover my face.

21:23.540 --> 21:24.710
( GRUNTS )

21:26.750 --> 21:27.960
I don't understand.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.710
Why didn't you free yourself?

21:30.040 --> 21:32.250
Why did you surrender
when Omashu was invaded?

21:32.340 --> 21:34.260
What's the matter with you, Bumi?!

21:34.340 --> 21:35.840
Listen to me, Aang.

21:36.130 --> 21:38.470
There are options in fighting called jing.

21:38.550 --> 21:41.600
It's a choice of how
you direct your energy.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.140
I know! Positive jing
when you're attacking,

21:44.220 --> 21:46.190
and negative jing when you're retreating.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.270
And neutral jing, when you do nothing.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.110
There are three jings?

21:51.190 --> 21:53.230
Well, technically, there are 85.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.400
But let's just focus on the third.

21:55.820 --> 21:58.780
Neutral jing is the key
to earthbending.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.200
It involves listening and waiting

22:01.280 --> 22:03.580
for the right moment to strike.

22:03.910 --> 22:06.080
That's why you surrendered, isn't it?

22:06.160 --> 22:08.670
Yes, and it's why I can't leave now.

22:10.750 --> 22:13.800
I guess I need to find someone else
to teach me earthbending.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.380
Your teacher will be someone

22:15.460 --> 22:17.760
who has mastered neutral jing.

22:17.840 --> 22:19.260
You need to find someone

22:19.340 --> 22:22.970
who waits and listens before striking.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.260
-( COOING )
- Hey, Momo.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.140
Momo's mastered
a few jings himself.

22:27.770 --> 22:28.940
( SQUEALS )

22:29.020 --> 22:30.270
Good-bye, Aang.

22:30.350 --> 22:33.150
I'll see you when the time is right.

22:33.270 --> 22:35.480
( LAUGHING )

22:35.610 --> 22:38.150
( SNORTING )

22:42.320 --> 22:45.160
So, we're tracking down
your brother and uncle, huh?

22:45.240 --> 22:47.450
It'll be interesting seeing Zuko again,

22:47.540 --> 22:48.870
won't it, Mai?

22:49.670 --> 22:52.500
It's not just Zuko And Iroh anymore.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.710
We have a third target now.

23:00.550 --> 23:02.430
( COOING )

23:05.180 --> 23:06.770
( GURGLING )

23:06.850 --> 23:07.980

23:08.100 --> 23:09.940
Tom-tom!
