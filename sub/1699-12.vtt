WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:07.888
Hey, guys.

00:10.495 --> 00:11.614
All right.

00:12.205 --> 00:13.774
Bam!

00:13.775 --> 00:14.682
Okay.

00:16.964 --> 00:18.102
Hey, Eric.

00:18.103 --> 00:19.070
Hey.

00:20.240 --> 00:22.209
Whew, he is so...

00:22.210 --> 00:23.670
fine!

00:24.586 --> 00:26.842
Yeah. Mm-mm!

00:28.500 --> 00:29.922
You know, for you.

00:29.923 --> 00:31.757
You know,
all for you.

00:33.905 --> 00:35.508
Um, Eddie

00:35.509 --> 00:37.097
your head's
on backwards.

00:37.098 --> 00:38.515
All part
of the plan.

00:38.516 --> 00:39.134
Chill out.

00:39.135 --> 00:40.315
Pipe down

00:40.316 --> 00:41.883
people...
people, please.

00:43.254 --> 00:45.278
Whose head is on backwards now?

00:45.279 --> 00:47.658
First an important
announcement...

00:48.425 --> 00:50.473
I'm being promoted
to principal...

00:50.474 --> 00:51.834
and Mr. Perkins

00:51.835 --> 00:53.870
is being pushed up
to superintendent.

00:54.748 --> 00:58.369
So you mean you won't
be teaching right here anymore?

00:58.370 --> 00:59.571
Precisely.

01:04.135 --> 01:06.034
I need a minute alone.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.419 --> 01:22.805
I'll be okay.

01:23.508 --> 01:26.320
So now, when you send me

01:26.321 --> 01:27.707
to the principal's office

01:27.708 --> 01:30.508
you're going to be sending me
to you?

01:31.540 --> 01:34.426
Oh, brain cramp.

01:36.235 --> 01:38.437
You'll have a substitute
for the rest of the week

01:38.438 --> 01:41.623
and on Monday there will be
a new teacher.

01:41.624 --> 01:43.569
So who do you think the
new teacher's going to be?

01:43.570 --> 01:45.469
I hope it's not
that whiny guy, you know.

01:45.470 --> 01:46.914
"Please, students, please

01:46.915 --> 01:49.126
"all I ask is
y'all sit down.

01:49.127 --> 01:50.287
Please help me."

01:51.898 --> 01:54.031
At least he's better
than that paranoid lady.

01:54.032 --> 01:55.187
"Why are you all
talking about me?

01:55.188 --> 01:56.304
"Why are you talking
about me?

01:56.305 --> 01:58.040
I know you guys
all hate me..."

01:58.041 --> 01:59.187
Ladies.

02:00.180 --> 02:01.563
Talking.

02:02.035 --> 02:04.496
Tragically neither one
is available.

02:04.497 --> 02:05.875
We've been having a heck
of a time

02:05.876 --> 02:07.601
finding a substitute.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.882
Hello, class.

02:16.883 --> 02:19.367
I'm your substitute,
Mrs. Baxter.

02:21.605 --> 02:23.702
You're not going
to believe this.

02:23.703 --> 02:25.269
My mom is going
to be the sub.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.304
Your mom?

02:26.305 --> 02:27.977
I know, I mean,
she used to teach

02:27.978 --> 02:29.227
but Mr. Lawler
doesn't know that.

02:29.228 --> 02:30.932
He hasn't even
met her before.

02:32.629 --> 02:35.386
Raven, you forgot your lunch.

02:36.775 --> 02:38.546
And she's not going
to know him now.

02:39.520 --> 02:40.740
Thanks, Mom.

02:40.741 --> 02:42.025
Oh, isn't that sweet.

02:42.026 --> 02:43.296
Buh-bye.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.255
Mrs. Baxter

02:44.256 --> 02:45.252
I don't believe we've had

02:45.253 --> 02:46.664
the pleasure
of meeting.

02:48.705 --> 02:50.117
Oh, and now you have

02:50.118 --> 02:51.725
so once again,
buh-bye.

02:51.726 --> 02:53.014
I've got learning
to do.

02:53.015 --> 02:55.645
You know, I wish
my students were this eager

02:55.646 --> 02:57.496
back when I was teaching
English.

02:57.497 --> 02:58.981
Well, I should go.

02:59.867 --> 03:01.060
You were an English teacher

03:01.061 --> 03:02.314
previously?

03:04.021 --> 03:07.223
Mrs. Baxter, I just had
the craziest idea...

03:07.224 --> 03:09.545
No!

04:00.314 --> 04:01.472
Yep, that's me.

04:08.557 --> 04:09.281
I just know it, Chel.

04:09.282 --> 04:10.554
My vision is going
to come true.

04:11.173 --> 04:13.043
Rae, would you stop
panicking, please.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.479
Just because Lawler
asked her to sub

04:14.480 --> 04:15.727
doesn't mean she's
going to do it.

04:15.728 --> 04:17.423
So let's talk about
something else.

04:18.178 --> 04:19.902
Is she an easy grader?

04:19.903 --> 04:21.987
You know what, this is
just too weird, okay?

04:21.988 --> 04:24.236
There has to be some way
I can change this thing.

04:29.977 --> 04:30.982
Hey, brother.

04:30.983 --> 04:31.801
How you doing?

04:31.802 --> 04:34.031
Um, I'm going to need you
to do me a favor, okay?

04:34.032 --> 04:36.482
When Mom comes downstairs,
and I'm going to cough

04:36.483 --> 04:37.820
and then I want you to say

04:37.821 --> 04:41.315
"Mommy, please don't leave me
all alone."

04:41.779 --> 04:43.040
Not a problem.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.249
I do this for you,
and I get...

04:47.571 --> 04:49.620
Forget it.

04:50.236 --> 04:52.294
Ooh, I like 'em feisty.

04:53.296 --> 04:55.037
Okay, you know what,
two bucks or nothing.

04:55.038 --> 04:56.168
Deal.

04:56.758 --> 04:57.788
Here you go.

04:59.861 --> 05:01.452
This ain't over yet, baby.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.090
Raven, that's just you
popping your gum.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.432
I thought they were
ripping up the sidewalk.

05:12.475 --> 05:13.283
Listen, honey

05:13.284 --> 05:15.042
I thought about
Mr. Lawler's offer.

05:15.043 --> 05:15.799
If you have
a problem

05:15.800 --> 05:17.233
with me subbing
for a couple of days...

05:17.234 --> 05:20.156
Oh, no, no, Mommy, you know
I'm totally fine with it

05:20.891 --> 05:23.403
but I am a little concerned
about my little brother.

05:23.404 --> 05:27.470
See, he gets home at what?
2:00, 2:45, right?

05:27.471 --> 05:28.938
And if you sub

05:28.939 --> 05:30.726
Mom, you won't
get home until 3:00.

05:30.727 --> 05:34.457
Now, when I was his age,
you were there for me.

05:35.164 --> 05:36.581
And those 15 minutes

05:36.582 --> 05:38.657
meant so much.

05:39.517 --> 05:40.735
Thank you, Mom.

05:42.974 --> 05:44.686
Let's just see how
Corey feels.

05:45.716 --> 05:48.217
Wait, are you saying
for 15 minutes

05:48.218 --> 05:50.550
I'd be home all by myself?

06:06.609 --> 06:08.784
Oh, yeah!

06:13.330 --> 06:14.834
Oh, don't worry about me, Mom.

06:14.835 --> 06:16.034
I'll be fine.

06:17.401 --> 06:19.745
I'd do something
about that cough.

06:23.916 --> 06:25.546
Windpipe.

06:29.808 --> 06:30.805
I don't want to go.

06:30.806 --> 06:32.726
Rae...
I don't want to go!

06:32.727 --> 06:34.222
Your mom isn't
even here yet.

06:34.223 --> 06:35.527
Just relax.

06:35.528 --> 06:36.701
Right. Relax.

06:36.702 --> 06:38.056
Relax, she's not here.

06:38.608 --> 06:39.716
But she's in the building.

06:39.717 --> 06:40.680
I can feel her.

06:40.681 --> 06:43.811
She's getting closer
and closer and closer.

06:43.812 --> 06:45.665
I can't see!
I can't see!

06:45.666 --> 06:46.796
Rae!

06:49.870 --> 06:50.943
It's a miracle.

06:54.718 --> 06:55.935
Hey, Eric.

06:55.936 --> 06:57.126
Hey.

06:57.612 --> 06:59.227
He is so...

06:59.763 --> 07:01.026
fine!

07:05.901 --> 07:07.367
Hello, class.

07:07.368 --> 07:10.068
I'm your substitute,
Mrs. Baxter.

07:12.768 --> 07:14.192
Today we're
going to be

07:14.193 --> 07:16.958
working on Romeo and Juliet.

07:17.436 --> 07:20.236
Can anyone tell me
what this play is about?

07:24.131 --> 07:25.801
Anyone?

07:28.508 --> 07:31.461
I know someone who can.

07:32.396 --> 07:33.396
Raven.

07:38.123 --> 07:39.367
Boy likes girl,
girl likes boy.

07:39.368 --> 07:40.914
They both die.
Cry, cry, cry, the end.

07:44.083 --> 07:45.110
Good.

07:45.111 --> 07:47.659
Fast, but good, honey.

07:48.481 --> 07:49.966
I meant Raven.

07:50.266 --> 07:52.844
I called her honey
because she's my...

07:54.388 --> 07:55.618
Oh, you know the story.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.628
Anyway...

07:58.102 --> 07:59.001
One more day.

07:59.002 --> 08:01.053
One... more... day.

08:07.031 --> 08:09.494
"Romeo, Romeo

08:09.495 --> 08:12.110
"Wherefore art thou,
Romeo?

08:12.111 --> 08:16.141
Deny thy father
and refuse thy name."

08:17.222 --> 08:19.895
Raven, I know
you're bummed out

08:19.896 --> 08:21.130
that your mom's
here and all

08:21.131 --> 08:23.049
but if it makes
you feel any better

08:23.766 --> 08:26.050
she's a babe.

08:28.581 --> 08:30.177
"That which
we call a rose

08:30.178 --> 08:32.735
by any other name
would smell as sweet."

08:32.736 --> 08:34.033
Sweet.

08:35.731 --> 08:38.755
Okay, let me try and make
this a little easier.

08:38.756 --> 08:41.104
If Shakespeare were
writing today

08:41.105 --> 08:42.937
it might sound more like this:

08:43.461 --> 08:46.547
"Yo, Romeo, where you at, okay?

08:46.548 --> 08:48.891
"Tell your daddy if he
don't like us together

08:48.892 --> 08:50.336
"then that's just too bad

08:50.337 --> 08:52.331
"because this Juliet
ain't waitin' around

08:52.332 --> 08:54.321
"for some fool in tights
named Romeo.

08:54.322 --> 08:55.711
You know what I'm sayin'?"

08:59.105 --> 09:01.856
And Romeo might
sound like this:

09:01.857 --> 09:03.227
"Do you believe the words

09:03.228 --> 09:04.721
"that are comin' out
of her mouth?

09:05.606 --> 09:06.758
"Should I speak up

09:06.759 --> 09:08.192
"and make a fool
of myself

09:08.193 --> 09:11.738
or just let her go on and on
about how fine she think I am?"

09:14.168 --> 09:15.714
Raven, gum.

09:20.425 --> 09:21.751
Three more hours.

09:21.752 --> 09:23.797
Just three more hours.

09:25.864 --> 09:28.063
I'm free!

09:28.064 --> 09:30.830
No Mom... no more Mom,
no more Mom

09:30.831 --> 09:34.469
No more Mom, no more Mom,
no more Mom, no more...

09:34.470 --> 09:35.586
Hey, Mom.

09:35.587 --> 09:36.580
Hey.

09:37.796 --> 09:38.923
Hey, you know what--

09:38.924 --> 09:40.055
these last two days

09:40.056 --> 09:41.625
man, it's like a blink.

09:41.626 --> 09:42.739
Where'd they go?

09:42.740 --> 09:44.861
I mean, I didn't see them.
Did you see them?

09:44.862 --> 09:46.040
I didn't see them.
Did you?

09:46.411 --> 09:47.937
Then I've got
good news.

09:47.938 --> 09:49.176
I just spoke with Mr. Lawler

09:49.177 --> 09:50.048
and he offered me

09:50.049 --> 09:51.556
a permanent
position.

09:52.716 --> 09:53.820
You okay with this?

09:56.187 --> 09:59.201
Well, actually...

10:02.844 --> 10:06.061
Raven, I love this job.

10:10.471 --> 10:11.830
Couldn't be happier.

10:11.831 --> 10:13.872
Thanks, sweetie.

10:15.103 --> 10:16.437
Honey, gum.

10:16.438 --> 10:17.347
Okay.

10:17.911 --> 10:20.208
Well, I'm on my way home
to tell your little brother.

10:20.209 --> 10:22.102
I just hope he understands.

10:29.481 --> 10:32.415
Everybody dancing!

10:43.194 --> 10:44.135
I don't get it, Raven.

10:44.136 --> 10:46.156
Your mom asked if you had a
problem with her teaching here.

10:46.157 --> 10:47.482
Why don't you just tell her
how you felt?

10:47.483 --> 10:50.245
Chelsea, okay, you did
not see my vision.

10:50.246 --> 10:51.652
First of all,
she loves this job

10:51.653 --> 10:53.517
and everybody in class
loves her, too.

10:53.518 --> 10:55.318
I just can't take that
away from her.

10:56.016 --> 10:57.883
You're a good daughter, Rae.

10:57.884 --> 10:58.959
Thanks.

10:59.319 --> 11:00.643
Maybe I can
get her fired.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.337
Kidding.
Can't I dream?

11:04.829 --> 11:06.169
I'm sorry.

11:07.298 --> 11:09.441
Raven, I've been
thinking

11:09.442 --> 11:13.059
and I don't mind
that your mom has kids.

11:13.060 --> 11:14.543
I'm good with kids.

11:16.975 --> 11:20.438
Max... my mama
is married, okay?

11:20.439 --> 11:22.412
Let it go before it gets ugly.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.127
And you're going to need this.

11:26.589 --> 11:28.249
Ooh, lucky penny.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.288
Hey, Eric.

11:35.289 --> 11:36.563
Hi.
Hey.

11:36.564 --> 11:38.758
I was wondering
if after school, you know

11:38.759 --> 11:39.466
you'd like to...?

11:39.467 --> 11:40.695
Eric, nice report.

11:40.696 --> 11:42.505
But next time maybe
you can hand it in

11:42.506 --> 11:44.442
without the pizza stains.

11:46.675 --> 11:48.961
I do not know what's up
with that new teacher.

11:49.608 --> 11:50.886
Tell me about it.

11:51.732 --> 11:52.600
So...

11:52.601 --> 11:54.595
Oh, and, honey, I'm going
to be home a little late.

11:54.596 --> 11:56.165
Do you mind starting
dinner? I've got chicken...

11:56.166 --> 11:57.452
Got it, got it, got it.

11:57.453 --> 11:58.553
Okay.

12:00.158 --> 12:01.121
I don't know

12:01.122 --> 12:03.603
what that woman
was talking about.

12:04.371 --> 12:05.628
You were saying?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.831
I got to go. Later.

12:10.974 --> 12:12.618
I had him, man.
I had him.

12:12.619 --> 12:13.563
He was in my grasp.

12:13.564 --> 12:16.172
I had him. I had him.
Mama, why?

12:21.788 --> 12:24.035
Having my mom here
has totally busted my game.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.339
I hate it.

12:25.340 --> 12:26.945
Okay, before
we get started

12:26.946 --> 12:28.130
I just wanted
to let you know

12:28.131 --> 12:29.211
that I'm going
to be your teacher

12:29.212 --> 12:30.441
for the rest of the year.

12:32.531 --> 12:34.500
Is all of that for me?

12:34.501 --> 12:36.773
Is that for me. You stop it!

12:36.774 --> 12:38.031
You stop it!

12:39.374 --> 12:40.974
What happened? You stop it?

12:42.731 --> 12:44.260
I just don't want her here.

12:44.261 --> 12:46.466
She's not funny.
She's embarrassing. She's...

12:46.467 --> 12:47.496
I hate this!

12:47.497 --> 12:49.756
Underline, underline,
underline!

12:55.294 --> 12:57.230
Man, Rae, this is cold.

12:57.231 --> 12:58.427
Pass it to Chelsea.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.927
Okay, guys
if you will take out

13:09.928 --> 13:11.033
your vocabulary list

13:11.034 --> 13:13.230
and review them,
I'll collect the homework.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.701
Thank you.

13:48.061 --> 13:50.558
Uh, Ms. Baxter,
may I just say how much I enjoy

13:50.559 --> 13:52.009
doing the homework assignment?

13:52.010 --> 13:54.541
But I'd like to change
one little bitty thing.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.000
Can I sea Chelsea's homework?

13:56.439 --> 13:59.086
Eddie, that would be called
cheating.

13:59.807 --> 14:01.469
That's not what
he meant.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.027
What did he mean?

14:03.028 --> 14:04.624
I don't know.

14:07.127 --> 14:08.145
Gotcha!

14:08.146 --> 14:09.762
It was all a joke.

14:09.763 --> 14:10.556
It's just a trick

14:10.557 --> 14:12.746
that we play on all of the substitutes

14:12.747 --> 14:14.682
and you didn't get it.

14:14.683 --> 14:15.861
And there it goes.

14:15.862 --> 14:17.218
Thank you.

14:17.616 --> 14:20.359
Listen, you'll all get
your reports back

14:20.360 --> 14:22.440
after I grade them
in the morning.

14:22.441 --> 14:24.709
As it should be,
Ms. Baxter.

14:24.710 --> 14:26.619
Spoken like a true teacher.

14:26.620 --> 14:27.785
Proud of you, Mom.

14:41.031 --> 14:45.052
Operation Note Rescue...
we attack at dawn.

15:03.831 --> 15:04.900
Ready?

15:04.901 --> 15:05.511
Ready.

15:05.512 --> 15:06.557
We're going in.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.535
No, we're not. It's locked.

15:09.536 --> 15:10.452
Oh, it's locked!

15:10.453 --> 15:11.143
I just said that.

15:11.144 --> 15:11.838
I know.

15:14.589 --> 15:15.845
Give me a boost.

15:17.304 --> 15:18.740
Come on. Come on.

15:19.230 --> 15:20.762
Get it. Get it.

15:24.369 --> 15:26.010
Good morning.

15:26.011 --> 15:28.024
Hi, Mr. Lawler.

15:28.025 --> 15:29.521
We're doing nothing wrong.

15:31.021 --> 15:34.431
Well, I'm pleased to see
my pupils here so early.

15:34.432 --> 15:35.836
As principal

15:35.837 --> 15:39.040
I arrive promptly at 6:30
and do a thorough inspection

15:39.041 --> 15:42.229
of the premises
with my master key.

15:42.230 --> 15:43.213
Watch.

15:44.631 --> 15:45.930
Open.

15:46.550 --> 15:47.639
Close.

15:48.659 --> 15:49.727
Open.

15:49.728 --> 15:51.169
Looks good in here.

15:51.170 --> 15:52.315
Close.

15:53.992 --> 15:56.839
Well, I better finish
patrolling the place.

15:57.296 --> 15:58.601
Toodles.

16:02.005 --> 16:03.032
Rae

16:03.033 --> 16:05.607
since you're hanging there,
could you open the door?

16:06.984 --> 16:08.236
No problem.

16:14.231 --> 16:15.650
Oh, it's locked!

16:15.651 --> 16:16.883
Where's the key?

16:16.884 --> 16:17.510
Guys?

16:17.511 --> 16:19.359
I don't have the key!

16:19.360 --> 16:21.013
Well, don't look at me.

16:21.014 --> 16:21.852
Guys?

16:22.531 --> 16:23.935
Try prying it open
or something.

16:23.936 --> 16:24.696
Okay.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.419
No good.
What are we going to do?

16:29.420 --> 16:33.058
Guys, hanging like a bat
over here!

16:34.900 --> 16:36.279
So what's the plan?

16:36.280 --> 16:38.419
Get this desk as far away
from my mama as possible.

16:38.420 --> 16:40.952
Yeah, but, Rae,
this is school property.

16:41.471 --> 16:43.043
I know, okay?

16:43.044 --> 16:45.375
That's why we're moving it
very carefully.

16:49.035 --> 16:51.033
Door, door, door!

17:03.804 --> 17:06.065
I don't mean to bug y'all
or anything

17:06.066 --> 17:08.142
but can we come up
with a better plan?

17:15.366 --> 17:17.839
Left!
No, right!

17:17.840 --> 17:19.107
Hey!

17:21.196 --> 17:23.262
Oh, man!

17:24.521 --> 17:25.938
This can't be good.

17:32.531 --> 17:34.397
Rae!

17:46.920 --> 17:48.862
Hey, where did
that desk come from?

17:48.863 --> 17:52.417
Uh, actually, Mr. Lawler

17:52.418 --> 17:55.035
this desk came from a tree.

17:55.036 --> 17:58.418
You know, until mankind
cut it down with no regard

17:58.419 --> 17:59.537
to nature and all...

18:02.425 --> 18:04.777
What she was trying to say,
Mr. Lawler

18:04.778 --> 18:07.820
is that we found it
in the parking lot

18:07.821 --> 18:09.581
and we're just, you know,
bringing it back, really.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.735
Well, pick me up
and put me down

18:12.736 --> 18:14.407
this is my old desk.

18:14.796 --> 18:16.697
Solid, sturdy.

18:17.037 --> 18:19.272
Except for this pesky drawer.

18:22.799 --> 18:24.159
Wait! Stop!

18:26.331 --> 18:27.730
Who are you talking to?

18:27.731 --> 18:34.073
Um, um, she was just
singing that new, cool song.

18:34.074 --> 18:35.653
You know,
how's does it go?

18:35.654 --> 18:36.619
You know...

18:38.801 --> 18:41.198
# Wait, stop, where ya going? #

18:41.199 --> 18:43.497
# Stop! Wait!
I'm a-coming #

18:48.806 --> 18:50.287
I like that.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.714
Come on, Mr. Thomas.

18:52.715 --> 18:55.078
Let's bring this baby back
upstairs.

18:55.378 --> 18:56.988
Show me how you do that...

18:57.807 --> 18:59.200
...thing.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.745
"Every single second
my mom's here

19:04.746 --> 19:06.123
"my life gets worse and worse.

19:06.124 --> 19:08.019
"If I see her face
in my class one more time

19:08.020 --> 19:09.159
I'm going to scream."

19:09.160 --> 19:11.205
Now you know why I don't want
her to read the note.

19:11.943 --> 19:14.949
Rae, I know it's really hard
having your mom here

19:14.950 --> 19:16.602
but maybe it'll get better.

19:16.603 --> 19:18.534
Maybe, but maybe it won't.

19:18.535 --> 19:19.778
Look, I love my mom

19:19.779 --> 19:23.099
and I love hanging out
with her, just not here.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.730
Here, I'm Raven

19:24.731 --> 19:28.241
but when she's here
I'm Mrs. Baxter's daughter.

19:28.242 --> 19:30.490
But, Rae, your mom's,
like, so cool.

19:30.491 --> 19:31.610
She'll understand.

19:32.121 --> 19:34.117
Yeah, she's so happy.

19:35.068 --> 19:36.740
I'll just have
to get used to it, huh?

19:58.761 --> 20:00.195
Hey, honey.

20:00.196 --> 20:01.258
Got a minute?

20:01.259 --> 20:02.092
Sure.

20:03.501 --> 20:05.841
You know,
being at school

20:05.842 --> 20:06.817
with you got me
to thinking

20:06.818 --> 20:08.396
about when I was
your age.

20:08.397 --> 20:10.533
I used to get away
with so much stuff.

20:10.534 --> 20:12.698
I had this one teacher,
Mr. Swenson.

20:12.699 --> 20:14.704
I did the best
imitation of him:

20:14.705 --> 20:18.546
Enunciate, Tanya!
Enunciate!

20:18.547 --> 20:20.436
I mean, I had the whole
class cracking up.

20:20.437 --> 20:21.498
You?

20:21.499 --> 20:22.935
Your mama had a life.

20:22.936 --> 20:25.216
And if there were
cute boys in the hall

20:25.217 --> 20:27.456
I'd be talking to 'em
like you

20:27.457 --> 20:28.702
with your friend Eric.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.874
Kind of blew that
for you, didn't I?

20:31.522 --> 20:33.160
You know...

20:33.713 --> 20:35.338
Yeah, Mama, yeah.

20:36.867 --> 20:39.581
Honey, I had a great time
when I was in school.

20:39.582 --> 20:41.411
But it would have been
really weird

20:41.412 --> 20:43.130
if my mom had been around.

20:45.084 --> 20:47.466
That's why I'm not going
to take this teaching job.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.925
What? Mama, all the kids
think you're great.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.399
Raven, I love this job.

20:54.037 --> 20:56.173
I know.
Being a teacher.

20:56.174 --> 20:58.839
No, being your mom.

21:02.365 --> 21:04.564
And when I do go back
to teaching

21:04.565 --> 21:06.406
I'll make sure it's
at a different school.

21:06.407 --> 21:07.372
Promise.

21:11.461 --> 21:12.496
Bam!

21:13.144 --> 21:14.986
Go on, Mama.
That was tight.

21:14.987 --> 21:17.002
What? You thought
you was the only one

21:17.003 --> 21:18.149
that could get some zap?

21:19.666 --> 21:21.256
Mama, what exactly was that?

21:21.257 --> 21:22.130
Was it, what?

21:22.131 --> 21:23.446
Shh... what was it?

21:23.447 --> 21:25.181
Girlfriend, if you think
you're going to jack my moves

21:25.182 --> 21:26.046
think again.

21:26.047 --> 21:27.134
But, Mama, wait.

21:38.957 --> 21:40.803
What are you doing here?

21:41.361 --> 21:42.777
Sorry, little man.

21:42.778 --> 21:43.986
This fantasy is taken.

21:44.534 --> 21:45.865
Oh, man!

21:45.866 --> 21:48.445
Get your little self
up off me!

21:56.204 --> 21:57.662
What's up, little man?

22:01.483 --> 22:05.631
You take my women,
I take your pizza.
