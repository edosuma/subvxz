WEBVTT

00:20.400 --> 00:23.367
GUYS, GET A MOVE ON.
ERIC'S GOING TO MISS
HIS FLIGHT.

00:23.367 --> 00:26.000
ERIC, YOU'RE GOING TO BOSTON
FOR THE CAMPING SHOW.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.867
NOW, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
FROM ANY OF THE SUPPLIERS

00:27.867 --> 00:29.200
THAT YOU MISSED MEETINGS

00:29.200 --> 00:31.667
BECAUSE YOU WERE AT THE
HOTEL BAR DANCING ON TABLES.

00:31.667 --> 00:34.300
OH!

00:34.300 --> 00:37.467
FATHER, FOR YOU TO EVEN
SUGGEST THAT I WOULD
BLOW OFF THE CAMPING SHOW

00:37.467 --> 00:38.500
TO GO PARTY HEARTY IN BOSTON,

00:38.500 --> 00:41.567
THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES
ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

00:41.567 --> 00:43.567
ERIC, YOU FORGOT YOUR BOOK.

00:43.567 --> 00:44.967
WHAT BOOK?

00:44.967 --> 00:47.767
<i>HOW TO ACT INNOCENT WHEN</i>
<i>YOUR FATHER CATCHES YOU.</i>

00:49.600 --> 00:50.867
ERIC.

00:50.867 --> 00:52.300
GUESS I BETTER READ IT AGAIN.

00:54.767 --> 00:56.100
BYE, MOM.

00:56.100 --> 00:56.667
BYE, HONEY.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.500
BYE.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.066
AMY, CORY, HI.

01:00.066 --> 01:01.300
IS THERE A LOCK
ON THIS?

01:01.300 --> 01:02.400
MR. FEENY.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.200
TOO LATE.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.500
I TRIED. I TRIED.
I TRIED. I TRIED.
I TRIED.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.700
I DON'T GET THE ASSIGNMENT.
I WANT TO DROP ECONOMICS.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.133
BUSINESS, FIGURES,
NUMBERS...

01:10.133 --> 01:14.367
I JUST CAN'T KEEP IT
IN MY HEAD. WHOO-HOO.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.100
SHAWN, IT'S SIMPLE.

01:16.100 --> 01:20.667
COME UP WITH A BUSINESS,
PRETEND YOU'RE RUNNING IT,
AND WRITE A REPORT.

01:20.667 --> 01:24.967
OH! NOW I--
WHOO-HOO. YOU SEE?

01:24.967 --> 01:26.600
NOW, COME ON, LET ME
DROP THE COURSE.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.700
NO HUNTER HAS EVER
MADE IT IN BUSINESS.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.934
WHY CAUSE ME AGONY? WHY?

01:31.934 --> 01:33.100
I LIKE IT.

01:34.367 --> 01:37.000
SHAWN, SIT DOWN.
IT'S QUIET TIME.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.600
AMY, HERE ARE MY HOUSE KEYS.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.700
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR LOOKING AFTER THINGS
WHILE I'M AWAY THIS WEEKEND.

01:42.700 --> 01:43.767
OH, SURE, GEORGE.

01:43.767 --> 01:45.967
NOW, IS THERE A NUMBER
AT THE HOTEL IN CASE
WE NEED TO REACH YOU?

01:45.967 --> 01:50.000
ACTUALLY,
I'M STAYING AT A LOVELY
BED-AND-BREAKFAST.

01:50.000 --> 01:50.934
OH, GOOD FOR YOU.

01:50.934 --> 01:53.233
LIVING IN SOMEONE
ELSE'S HOUSE, EATING
SOMEONE ELSE'S FOOD.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.767
SO WHAT'S THAT RUN YOU,
LIKE 2 BUCKS?

02:00.767 --> 02:03.767
ACTUALLY, SHAWN, A ROOM
IN A NICE BED-AND-BREAKFAST

02:03.767 --> 02:06.934
CAN GO FOR AS HIGH AS $200
A NIGHT. RIGHT, GEORGE?

02:06.934 --> 02:08.667
NOT THIS ONE.

02:08.667 --> 02:11.934
$200 A NIGHT? WOW.

02:11.934 --> 02:14.700
I HAVE MADE A LIST
OF THINGS THAT HAVE
TO BE DONE--

02:14.700 --> 02:18.400
PLANTS TO WATER AND,
UH, PLANTS THAT WILL
NEED VITAMINS

02:18.400 --> 02:22.300
AND PLANTS THAT NEED
TO BE ROTATED TO GET
THE MORNING SUN.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.200
OH, YOU'LL DO FINE.
THANK YOU!

02:28.500 --> 02:30.233
JUST DON'T KILL THEM.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.734
SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
IT'S JUST A HOUSE.

02:37.734 --> 02:39.367
NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS FEENY'S HOUSE.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.900
THERE'S GOT TO BE,
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME SHRUNKEN HEADS,

02:41.900 --> 02:44.600
SOME EYEBALLS IN JARS,
VOODOO DOLLS.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.667
NOW, WHY WOULD HE HAVE
STUFF LIKE THAT?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.600
WELL, HE TOOK THEM
FROM ME LAST YEAR.

02:48.600 --> 02:52.800
OK. I'M GOING TO GO JUMP
ON FEENY'S BED JUST LIKE
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED OF.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.000
OK.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.367
OH, MY HISTORY PAPER
AND A RED PEN!

02:59.367 --> 03:00.967
FEENY, YOU FOOL.

03:00.967 --> 03:06.967
"CORY, YOU FOOL. PUT DOWN
THE PAPER AND STEP AWAY
FROM MY WALNUT CREDENZA."

03:07.300 --> 03:08.500
EEE!

03:08.500 --> 03:09.700
AAH!

03:09.700 --> 03:10.800
SHAWN?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.100
IT'S OK. IT'S OK.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.200
THOUGHT I SAW A POSTER
OF ME, BUT IT'S JUST
A MIRROR.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.200
CORY, THIS IS LIKE
NOTHING YOU'VE EVER
DREAMED OF.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.367
WHAT?

03:19.367 --> 03:21.367
HE'S GOT 3 BEDROOMS,
BEAUTIFULLY DECORATED,

03:21.367 --> 03:22.467
BUT HERE'S THE BEST.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.867
FEENY'S GOT
A 6-FOOT ROUND TUB.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.734
WELL, THE MAN'S
GOT TO BATHE.

03:26.734 --> 03:28.300
WITH JETS.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.867
OH, KOOKY.

03:30.867 --> 03:33.200
YOU KNOW, I THINK
I MAY HAVE AN IDEA FOR
MY ECONOMICS PROJECT.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.300
I'M GOING
TO GO GET STARTED.

03:34.300 --> 03:35.400
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.500
I DON'T WANT TO BE
ALONE IN HERE.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.200
HI.
HI.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.000
MY NAME IS DYLAN HIGHTOWER.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.200
I'M THE C.E.O. OF A MID-SIZED
VENTURE-CAPITAL GROUP.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.000
YOU MIGHT LOOK FOR ME
ON THE COVER
OF NEXT MONTH'S<i>FORB-EES.</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:55.500
IT'LL LOOK SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

03:58.867 --> 04:02.000
YOU'RE JUST OUT
OF HIGH SCHOOL,
YOU WORK FOR YOUR DADDY,

04:02.000 --> 04:03.667
THIS IS YOUR FIRST
CONVENTION,

04:03.667 --> 04:05.000
AND IT'S PRONOUNCED
<i>FORBES.</i>

04:05.000 --> 04:06.400
AND WHAT'S
YOUR REAL NAME?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.200
I'M NOT TELLING.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.300
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
DRINKING, MYSTERY BOY?

04:11.300 --> 04:12.834
UH, BREWSKI.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.300
ROOT BREWSKI?

04:14.300 --> 04:15.700
IF THAT'S ALL
YOU CAN GIVE ME, SURE.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.400
IT SURE IS, BUT...

04:18.400 --> 04:21.400
I WILL DO THIS.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.600
COOL.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.967
I BELIEVE YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO CATCH THE GLASS,
MR. MATTHEWS.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.500
OH, NO.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.867
MR. FEENY!

04:33.867 --> 04:35.467
YOU'RE HERE. WHAT A...

04:35.467 --> 04:38.300
REMARKABLE AND
HORRIFYING COINCIDENCE.

04:38.300 --> 04:39.500
HORRIFYING INDEED.

04:39.500 --> 04:40.667
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN BEANTOWN?

04:40.667 --> 04:42.400
HIDING FROM YOU,
AND I FAILED.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.700
WHY MUST YOU STALK ME SO?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.400
SORRY
TO BURST YOUR BALLOON,

04:45.400 --> 04:47.567
BUSTER, BUT I'M WAITING
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

04:47.567 --> 04:48.667
CORY?

04:48.667 --> 04:50.900
NO, NOT CORY.

04:50.900 --> 04:52.867
CABERNET.

04:52.867 --> 04:55.767
I'M WAITING
FOR A SPECIAL
LADY FRIEND OF MINE

04:55.767 --> 04:57.200
TO HAVE DINNER
IN THE HOTEL.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.567
OH, MR. FEENY,
I DIDN'T KNOW

04:58.567 --> 05:00.200
YOU HAD SOMEBODY SPECIAL
IN BOSTON.

05:00.200 --> 05:04.100
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
I'VE NEVER MENTIONED HER
TO YOU BEFORE, ERIC.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.200
AND WHY NOT?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.600
FOR THE SAME REASON

05:06.600 --> 05:09.367
THAT YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT
YOUR GIRLFRIENDS TO ME.

05:09.367 --> 05:10.867
IT'S SQUEAMY?

05:10.867 --> 05:12.967
PRECISELY.

05:12.967 --> 05:15.133
BUT NOW THAT
YOU'VE ASKED...

05:15.133 --> 05:16.667
I DIDN'T.

05:16.667 --> 05:21.100
ELIZABETH IS SOMEONE
I'VE KNOWN FOR,
OH, 15 YEARS,

05:21.100 --> 05:23.000
SOMEONE I CARE
ABOUT DEEPLY,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.200
BUT SHE LIVES
AND WORKS IN BOSTON,

05:26.200 --> 05:30.734
AND HER TEACHING CAREER
IS AS IMPORTANT TO HER
AS MINE IS TO ME.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.400
A FEMALE FEENY. YII.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.400
SO, HOW OFTEN DO YOU
GUYS SEE EACH OTHER?

05:35.400 --> 05:37.133
3 OR 4 TIMES A YEAR.

05:37.133 --> 05:41.100
EVERY SO OFTEN, ONE
OF US ASKS THE OTHER
TO GIVE IT ALL UP

05:41.100 --> 05:44.400
AND MOVE SO THAT
WE CAN BE TOGETHER.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.033
BUT YOU NEVER
TOOK HER UP ON IT?

05:46.033 --> 05:48.600
NOR SHE ME. NO.

05:48.600 --> 05:53.100
THE ASKING AND SAYING NO
HAS BECOME A BITTERSWEET
RITUAL BETWEEN US.

05:53.100 --> 05:56.934
THIS YEAR IT'S MY TURN
TO POP THE QUESTION.

05:56.934 --> 05:58.800
WHAT IF SHE SAYS YES?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.233
OH, SHE WON'T.

06:00.233 --> 06:05.900
NO, SHE'LL JUST SMILE
AT ME OVER HER GLASS
OF MERLOT AND ASK,

06:05.900 --> 06:08.100
"CAN'T WE
JUST KEEP THINGS
THE WAY THEY ARE?"

06:08.100 --> 06:10.800
AND I'LL SQUEEZE
HER HAND GENTLY

06:10.800 --> 06:14.500
AND SAY, "IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU TRULY WANT."

06:14.500 --> 06:16.667
AND THEN I'LL GO HOME.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.200
TO ME AND CORY.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.367
YOU'RE KILLING MY STORY.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.000
[WHISTLING]

06:26.000 --> 06:27.300
SHAWN.

06:27.300 --> 06:30.100
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN FEENY'S HOUSE WITHOUT ME?

06:30.100 --> 06:33.934
ACTUALLY, I'M HERE
TO WORK ON MY SCHOOL
PROJECT. YOU PROUD?

06:33.934 --> 06:36.200
WHY HERE?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.567
I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER
THAT WOULDN'T UPSET YOU.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.800
CAN YOU ROTATE THESE
2 PLANTS JUST A LITTLE?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.967
NO, NO, NO. WHAT'S
YOUR SCHOOL PROJECT, SHAWN?

06:42.967 --> 06:44.500
NO, DON'T TELL ME.
YES, TELL ME.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.500
TELL ME, BUT LIE.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.400

THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
HE WANTS THIS TO HAPPEN.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.867
AAAH!

07:46.867 --> 07:49.100
CORY, IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAY
AT MY BED-AND-BREAKFAST,

07:49.100 --> 07:50.900

SHAWN'S EVIL SCHEMES?

09:32.100 --> 09:34.100

YOU'RE THE BRAINS.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.834
THE BRAINS?

10:01.834 --> 10:04.834
HUH. I RATHER LIKE THAT.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.734
OK. JUST PROMISE ME THIS,

10:06.734 --> 10:12.700
THAT WHEN FEENY GETS BACK,
HE FINDS HIS HOUSE EXACTLY
AS HE LEFT IT. OK?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.500
YOU HAVE MY WORD.
GOOD.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.300
IS THIS ITEM FOR SALE?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.900

YOU SEE IS FOR SALE.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.200
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.700

TO WAIT UP FOR YOUR...

10:30.700 --> 10:32.000
WHAT IS HE, EXACTLY?

10:32.000 --> 10:34.400
OH, MR. FEENY?
HE'S MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR,

10:34.400 --> 10:36.300
AND HE USED TO BE MY TEACHER,

10:36.300 --> 10:39.000
AND HE'S REAL CONCERNED
ABOUT WHERE MY LIFE IS GOING.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.367
WHAT WOULD YOU CALL THAT?

10:40.367 --> 10:42.000
I'D CALL THAT A FRIEND.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.400
YEAH? FEENY?
FRIEND? OK.

10:47.667 --> 10:49.700
SO LISTEN, I GET OFF
WORK IN 10 MINUTES,

10:49.700 --> 10:53.200
AND, UH, YOU SEEM
REAL NICE. HOW ABOUT
I BUY YOU DINNER?

10:53.200 --> 10:56.600
WELL, AS LONG AS IT
WOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH
MY LOYALTY TO MY FRIEND.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.500
HEY, ISN'T THAT HIM NOW?

11:00.500 --> 11:01.934
YEAH, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE,

11:01.934 --> 11:03.700
BECAUSE SOMETHING GOOD WAS
GOING TO HAPPEN IN MY LIFE.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.900
SOMETHING REALLY GOOD.

11:11.734 --> 11:14.100
HEY, HE SEEMS TROUBLED.

11:14.100 --> 11:18.100
YEAH, BUT--BUT, SEE,
IT'S MY FIRST CONVENTION
AWAY FROM HOME,

11:18.100 --> 11:20.233
AND DINNER WITH A LADY
BARTENDER WOULD BE...

11:22.900 --> 11:24.667
OH, I HATE EVERYTHING.

11:24.667 --> 11:25.700
HEY.

11:41.934 --> 11:43.767
HELLO, ERIC.

11:44.867 --> 11:46.667
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

11:46.667 --> 11:50.300
YOU KNOW, EVERY YEAR
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING HER,

11:50.300 --> 11:52.834
AND EVERY YEAR
WE PART COMPANY...

11:52.834 --> 11:57.567
KNOWING THAT WE CARE
FOR EACH OTHER,
BUT NOT QUITE ENOUGH

11:57.567 --> 12:03.033
TO GIVE UP THE LIVES
WE'VE MADE AND FIND
COMFORTABLE.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.400
SHE SAID YES.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.000
YOU POPPED THE QUESTION,
AND SHE SAID YES.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.233
SHE SAID YES,
AND YOU'RE STUCK GOOD.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.834
NO, NO, SHE SAID NO.

12:11.834 --> 12:13.934
WE ALWAYS SAY NO.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.100
WHY DO WE ALWAYS SAY NO?

12:16.100 --> 12:18.000
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.867
NOW, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW
THAT, MR. MATTHEWS?

12:20.867 --> 12:22.200
BECAUSE IF YOU TRULY
LOVED EACH OTHER,

12:22.200 --> 12:25.133
YOU'D RISK ANYTHING
FOR THAT LOVE...

12:25.133 --> 12:29.200
EVEN THE LIVES YOU'VE MADE
AND FIND COMFORTABLE.

12:29.200 --> 12:33.133
I JUST WONDER IF
AT THIS STAGE OF MY LIFE,

12:33.133 --> 12:36.667
MY RISK-TAKING DAYS
ARE OVER.

12:36.667 --> 12:41.900
OR PERHAPS I NEVER
APPRECIATED THE VALUE
OF TAKING A RISK,

12:41.900 --> 12:47.133
AND THAT'S WHY I'VE MISSED
THE CHANCE AT TRUE LOVE.

12:47.133 --> 12:52.233
YEAH. I FELT THAT SAME WAY
WHEN I BROKE UP WITH DEBBIE.

12:52.233 --> 12:53.600
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.367
NO.

12:55.367 --> 12:58.000
WELL, I MEAN, I'M STILL
IN THERE PLUGGING AWAY,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.400
BECAUSE I BELIEVE TRUE LOVE
CAN COME AT ANY TIME.

13:00.400 --> 13:06.367
WELL, UNTIL THEN,
I WILL CONTINUE MY LIFE
TEACHING MY STUDENTS.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.000

YOUR STUDENTS, MR. FEENY.

YOUR DINNER YET,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.367
I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING
A LITTLE RISKIER.

13:23.367 --> 13:29.200
MAYBE YOU--YOU AND ME
CAN GO OUT, HIT THE TOWN,
CHECK OUT THE ACTION.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.800
AND THE UNIVERSE
IS A BETTER TOWN FOR THAT.

20:20.300 --> 20:23.934
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE
THE HONEYMOON COUPLE,

20:23.934 --> 20:27.367
AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE PAID
FOR 2 NIGHTS,

20:27.367 --> 20:32.667
BUT I REALLY MUST INSIST
THAT YOU VACATE MY BEDROOM
IMMEDIATELY.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.800
CHECK-OUT TIME
IS NOW.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.734
OH, LISTEN.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.934
IT'S NOT THAT
I CAN'T IDENTIFY

20:44.934 --> 20:47.467
WITH TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
IN LOVE.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.233
I WAS YOUNG ONCE.

20:50.233 --> 20:53.800
I KNOW THAT WHEN LOVE COMES,
YOU MUST SEIZE IT,

20:53.800 --> 20:57.500
LEST IT SLIP AWAY
THROUGH THE SANDS OF TIME.

20:57.934 --> 20:59.600
I WAS YOUNG ONCE.

21:13.567 --> 21:15.233
PERHAPS
I STILL AM.
