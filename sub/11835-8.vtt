00:02.972 --> 00:05.307
We've all seen
the famous videotape.

00:06.308 --> 00:07.810
It does look like you.

00:07.844 --> 00:09.979
That's the bad news.

00:10.012 --> 00:13.716
The good news is it's only from
the side and the back.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.451
The face isn't visible.

00:15.484 --> 00:17.019
Why is that good news, Jimmy?

00:17.053 --> 00:19.989
If the face were visible,
the jury would see it wasn't me.

00:21.557 --> 00:22.859
Right.

00:24.126 --> 00:25.227
Are you ready?

00:26.128 --> 00:27.463
I guess.

00:29.265 --> 00:31.567
Is a person ever ready
to stand trial for murder?

00:36.572 --> 00:38.340
We're going to get
through this.

00:39.308 --> 00:43.012
I know. I'm okay.

00:43.045 --> 00:44.480
You're sure?

00:45.648 --> 00:46.816
Yeah.

00:46.849 --> 00:48.851
Now, go home.

00:48.885 --> 00:50.486
Get a good night's sleep
if you can.

00:51.888 --> 00:53.155
Tomorrow it starts.

00:56.425 --> 00:58.560
(sighs) Thank you, Bobby.

01:07.303 --> 01:08.270
Okay, see you tomorrow.

01:09.171 --> 01:10.807
Bobby...

01:10.840 --> 01:13.275
you don't think we should be
looking to cut a deal here?

01:16.846 --> 01:18.614
There's no deal to be had.

01:18.648 --> 01:20.349
We'd get manslaughter
at best,

01:20.382 --> 01:21.350
which is
out of the question.

01:21.383 --> 01:23.219
Why is it
out of the question?

01:23.252 --> 01:26.455
They got motive.
Forensics put her at the scene.

01:26.488 --> 01:28.424
That videotape gives
them timing.

01:28.457 --> 01:31.093
The case got tougher,
I agree.

01:31.127 --> 01:34.130
But how can we accept
a homicide conviction on this,

01:34.163 --> 01:35.765
even if it's manslaughter?

01:35.798 --> 01:38.701
Bobby...you don't think
she did it?

01:39.902 --> 01:42.238
I know she didn't do it.

01:44.140 --> 01:45.742
She's innocent.

01:47.209 --> 01:48.344
Okay.

01:51.948 --> 01:54.951
(music playing)

02:42.364 --> 02:44.133
There's evidently
some press out front,

02:44.166 --> 02:46.002
but they've agreed to let you
come in through the back.

02:46.035 --> 02:47.636
I think it's best
we do that.

02:47.670 --> 02:48.805
Okay.

02:48.838 --> 02:51.473
Hey. Confident.

02:52.408 --> 02:53.843
Remember?

02:53.876 --> 02:56.612
(alarm beeping)
LUCY: Oh, here we go.
Great timing.

02:56.646 --> 02:59.615
What's wrong?
Rape crisis.

02:59.649 --> 03:02.084
Eugene, you're in charge.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.458
Lucy Hatcher,
Rape Crisis.

03:09.491 --> 03:10.793
Through that door.

03:33.082 --> 03:35.117
Ms. Walters...

03:36.585 --> 03:39.388
I'm Lucy Hatcher
from Rape Crisis.

03:39.421 --> 03:42.191
Thank you for coming.

03:42.224 --> 03:44.794
I'll, um...

03:44.827 --> 03:47.463
I'll just explain to you
some of the procedures.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.502
The key thing here is
trajectory.

03:53.535 --> 03:56.438
You can see it go slightly
downward.

03:56.472 --> 03:58.775
Typically, in a suicide,

03:58.808 --> 04:01.443
when somebody puts a gun
to his head,

04:01.477 --> 04:03.445
the line would be upwards.

04:03.479 --> 04:07.249
Specifically, doctor, what did
the trajectory here indicate?

04:07.283 --> 04:10.452
That somebody was standing over
him and shot him point-blank

04:10.486 --> 04:12.221
from slightly behind,

04:12.254 --> 04:15.357
which would also account
for why he fell forward.

04:15.391 --> 04:17.358
BOBBY: Typically contact
wounds to the head

04:17.392 --> 04:19.628
are more times than not
suicides.

04:19.661 --> 04:21.731
That is correct, but--
Thank you, doctor.

04:21.764 --> 04:24.834
And doctor, can you state
to a medical certainty

04:24.867 --> 04:27.269
this was not a suicide?

04:27.303 --> 04:29.706
We can't rule it out
to a medical certainty.

04:29.739 --> 04:31.140
Thank you, doctor.

04:31.173 --> 04:32.809
As I read
the coroner's incidental report,

04:32.842 --> 04:35.778
I see listed under cause
of death--

04:35.812 --> 04:37.613
"probable suicide."

04:37.647 --> 04:39.916
Yes, but we later concluded
otherwise.

04:39.949 --> 04:41.851
Yes, and was that
subsequent conclusion

04:41.884 --> 04:44.320
based strictly
on autopsy findings,

04:44.353 --> 04:46.255
or did you take into
consideration

04:46.288 --> 04:48.791
other circumstantial
or physical evidence

04:48.825 --> 04:50.860
supplied to you
by the police?

04:50.893 --> 04:53.930
We considered other evidence
as well.

04:53.963 --> 04:55.497
Thank you, doctor.

05:00.837 --> 05:02.371
I don't understand.

05:02.404 --> 05:05.374
You plan to put Mr. Potter's
reputation on trial?

05:05.407 --> 05:07.309
No, we don't.
We just...

05:09.045 --> 05:11.848
If he had an affair
with Ms. Dafoe,

05:11.881 --> 05:14.684
did he have any other affairs
to your knowledge?

05:14.717 --> 05:16.252
Not to my knowledge,

05:16.285 --> 05:18.187
but it's not as if
he would tell me.

05:18.220 --> 05:21.724
No, but as his secretary,
you would know the calls he got

05:21.758 --> 05:23.192
and see who walked
in his office.

05:23.225 --> 05:26.395
Well, the only person
was Ms. Dafoe.

05:30.733 --> 05:31.768
Hey.

05:31.801 --> 05:33.870
Hey, Helen.

05:33.903 --> 05:36.605
Sybil, this is Helen Gamble.
She's a district attorney.

05:36.639 --> 05:38.207
How you doing?

05:38.240 --> 05:42.511
Well, all things considered,
Philadelphia seems nice.

05:42.544 --> 05:43.880
Yeah.

05:43.913 --> 05:46.248
Well, I do have
some good news.

05:46.282 --> 05:47.717
We caught the man.

05:48.484 --> 05:49.551
You did?

05:49.585 --> 05:51.587
He posed as a delivery boy.

05:53.622 --> 05:54.991
Listen...

05:55.024 --> 05:58.560
do you think you could possibly
look at a police lineup?

05:59.729 --> 06:01.130
Be in a room with him?

06:01.163 --> 06:04.100
No, a separate room,
and he wouldn't see you.

06:04.133 --> 06:06.235
I could be right with you
at all times.

06:06.268 --> 06:09.205
Oh, God, I don't know.

06:09.238 --> 06:10.807
It would only take
a minute.

06:31.393 --> 06:34.363
It was two nights before the
accident that I discovered them.

06:34.396 --> 06:35.898
Your husband
and the defendant?

06:35.932 --> 06:39.201
Yes. I was leaving for the
weekend to visit my sister.

06:39.235 --> 06:40.569
My flight was canceled.

06:41.603 --> 06:42.639
I came back home.

06:43.605 --> 06:45.041
She was there.

06:45.074 --> 06:47.476
And what happened then,
Mrs. Potter?

06:47.509 --> 06:51.247
Well, Bernard and I had
a rather massive argument.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.715
We, um...

06:54.350 --> 06:57.019
Two days later we were
still fighting.

06:57.053 --> 06:59.856
And it was during an argument
while driving

06:59.889 --> 07:02.158
that the accident happened.

07:02.191 --> 07:05.561
As a result of
this automobile accident,

07:05.594 --> 07:08.297
you lost the use
of your legs?

07:08.330 --> 07:09.966
Yes.

07:09.999 --> 07:12.669
How did your husband react
to your injury?

07:13.635 --> 07:15.805
He, uh,
felt extremely guilty.

07:17.674 --> 07:19.508
Shortly after, he...

07:19.541 --> 07:21.878
terminated his relationship
with Ms. Dafoe.

07:22.779 --> 07:24.847
Did you ever talk to her?

07:25.748 --> 07:27.684
On a couple of occasions.

07:27.717 --> 07:29.185
Could you describe
her demeanor?

07:29.218 --> 07:34.323
She just... seemed urgent
to the point of being frantic.

07:34.356 --> 07:37.493
So from your observations,
she didn't take the breakup
very well?

07:38.227 --> 07:39.428
No.

07:39.461 --> 07:41.497
Now, Mrs. Potter,

07:41.530 --> 07:43.299
the defense has speculated

07:43.332 --> 07:46.502
that your husband possibly
took his own life.

07:46.535 --> 07:49.739
I can't believe
he would commit suicide.

07:49.772 --> 07:52.174
On the day of his death,

07:52.208 --> 07:54.677
did he seem
despondent or--

07:54.711 --> 07:56.679
I will not sit here
and proclaim

07:56.713 --> 07:58.447
he was a happy man
the day he died.

08:01.283 --> 08:02.284
But...

08:04.120 --> 08:06.255
to the extent, I can say

08:06.288 --> 08:07.857
that I did know
my husband...

08:09.726 --> 08:12.228
...I cannot see him
capable of suicide.

08:20.569 --> 08:22.905
You have to cross her
easy, Jimmy.

08:22.939 --> 08:25.742
Otherwise we'll completely
alienate the jury.

08:25.775 --> 08:27.109
I know.

08:27.143 --> 08:28.544
I don't think she hurt us
too badly.

08:30.880 --> 08:31.814
Whoops.

08:31.848 --> 08:33.883
Here's a burp cloth.

08:33.916 --> 08:35.551
I think he's had enough.

08:37.754 --> 08:39.221
Any word from Rebecca?

08:39.255 --> 08:40.823
She's still doing interviews.

08:40.857 --> 08:42.659
I'll see if she's called in.

08:45.728 --> 08:48.097
This is how my life
was supposed to have turned out.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.002
I grew up in a family where
family was everything.

08:54.570 --> 08:57.073
So when people look
at me like I'm a murderer,

08:58.440 --> 08:59.909
I can at least console
myself with the fact

08:59.942 --> 09:01.911
that they have it wrong.

09:03.179 --> 09:05.547
When I feel the accusation
of being a homewrecker...

09:08.017 --> 09:09.185
it really hurts...

09:11.120 --> 09:12.321
...'cause they have it right.

09:18.661 --> 09:19.762
Hey.

09:19.796 --> 09:21.430
Hi.

09:21.463 --> 09:23.332
Sorry I'm late.
The depo ran over.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.102
Hey, buddy.

09:26.135 --> 09:27.870
Come here.

09:29.706 --> 09:30.907
Hi.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.108
How'd the first day go?

09:32.141 --> 09:33.442
Not too bad.

09:33.475 --> 09:35.912
But their big guns
come tomorrow.

09:35.945 --> 09:38.848
I'll probably have
a late night tonight.

09:38.881 --> 09:40.950
Okay.

09:40.983 --> 09:42.819
Late night for Jimmy, too?

09:42.852 --> 09:44.020
Probably.

09:54.596 --> 09:56.799
At the time
of your husband's death,

09:56.833 --> 10:00.402
you testified these
were not happy times.

10:00.436 --> 10:03.572
In fact, he was being treated
for depression, wasn't he?

10:03.605 --> 10:04.741
Yes.

10:04.774 --> 10:06.475
And you also spoke
of his guilt,

10:06.508 --> 10:08.678
for both the affair
and the accident.

10:09.078 --> 10:10.647
Yes.

10:10.680 --> 10:14.817
What is-- or was--
your favorite hobby?

10:16.485 --> 10:18.187
Walking.

10:18.220 --> 10:20.857
I'm told you'd
often drive into the city

10:20.890 --> 10:23.092
and walk for hours.
Is that correct?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.061
I wrote short stories.

10:26.428 --> 10:29.531
So walking...
observing people...

10:31.267 --> 10:33.635
And you also loved it.

10:36.605 --> 10:37.974
Yes.

10:38.007 --> 10:39.642
Did your husband
once say to people,

10:39.676 --> 10:41.944
he wished he'd been killed
in the accident?

10:41.978 --> 10:45.848
He said he'd rather
he lost his life

10:45.882 --> 10:47.684
than me lose my legs, yes.

10:49.385 --> 10:52.221
But I never took it
to mean he was suicidal.

10:52.254 --> 10:53.990
But he said it.

10:54.023 --> 10:55.958
He wished he'd been killed.

11:02.899 --> 11:05.501
Now, if at any time you feel
this is too much...

11:05.534 --> 11:07.136
Okay.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.006
Bring them in.

11:17.980 --> 11:20.650
Are you okay?
Yes.

11:20.683 --> 11:22.251
McGUIRE: Number one,
please step forward.

11:26.288 --> 11:27.690
No.

11:27.724 --> 11:29.525
McGUIRE: Step back,
number one.

11:29.558 --> 11:30.693
Number two,
please step forward.

11:33.896 --> 11:34.964
No.

11:35.898 --> 11:37.199
Number two, step back.

11:37.233 --> 11:39.301
Number three,
step forward.

11:50.412 --> 11:51.648
Ms. Walters...

11:53.349 --> 11:55.217
Do you recognize this man?

11:56.919 --> 11:58.420
(voice shaking) No.

11:59.856 --> 12:01.357
Are you sure?

12:02.358 --> 12:03.793
It isn't him.

12:12.434 --> 12:13.836
I'll check on her.

12:17.239 --> 12:19.241
She recognized him, Lucy.

12:19.275 --> 12:22.478
(door shuts)
She must still be
in trauma.

12:22.511 --> 12:24.046
It was probably too soon
to do this.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.015
Maybe, but here's our problem:

12:26.048 --> 12:28.250
the rape kit didn't
give us anything.

12:28.284 --> 12:32.254
He was likely wearing a condom,
which we've yet to find.

12:32.288 --> 12:36.558
Look, our ability to put this
guy away depends on her.

12:36.592 --> 12:39.161
Without the ID,
I can't even file.

12:39.195 --> 12:41.430
You didn't find
any forensic evidence?

12:42.631 --> 12:45.167
We found three hairs
in the victim's office,

12:45.201 --> 12:46.936
all belonging
to the defendant.

12:46.969 --> 12:48.437
Now, the defendant
certainly admits

12:48.470 --> 12:50.206
to being in that office
in the past.

12:50.239 --> 12:51.874
The cleaning crew
informed us

12:51.908 --> 12:54.576
that the floors are vacuumed
every single night.

12:54.610 --> 12:56.278
Which led you to conclude...

12:56.312 --> 12:58.580
Ms. Dafoe was there
that night.

12:58.614 --> 13:00.950
Any other evidence pointing
to that?

13:00.983 --> 13:04.086
Telephone records show
Mr. Potter placed a call to her

13:04.120 --> 13:06.155
forty minutes prior
to the murder.

13:06.188 --> 13:08.257
Then, of course,
the videotape.

13:09.859 --> 13:12.094
That's the clearest
image we have.

13:12.128 --> 13:13.462
KENNETH: This was taken when?

13:13.495 --> 13:15.798
DETECTIVE: Three minutes
after the gunshot was heard.

13:15.832 --> 13:19.601
Now, Detective, is there any
footage of this person

13:19.635 --> 13:21.237
going into the stairwell?

13:21.270 --> 13:24.841
No. Our theory is she probably
went up in the elevator.

13:24.874 --> 13:27.276
So you think it's likely
that this person

13:27.309 --> 13:30.412
went up the elevator
and down the stairwell?

13:30.446 --> 13:31.480
Correct.

13:31.513 --> 13:34.016
Detective, are you able to tell

13:34.050 --> 13:37.586
from this video
how tall this person is?

13:37.619 --> 13:39.656
Yes. Breaking it
down to scale,

13:39.689 --> 13:42.759
we determined this person
is 5'4" tall.

13:42.792 --> 13:45.627
How tall is the defendant,
if you know?

13:45.662 --> 13:47.964
Five feet, four inches tall.

13:49.431 --> 13:53.069
The two weeks before,
she would come in unannounced,

13:53.102 --> 13:55.204
demand to see Mr. Potter.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.006
She'd also call a lot.

13:57.039 --> 14:00.677
Could you describe Katie Dafoe's
demeanor during these visits?

14:00.710 --> 14:03.012
She was upset.

14:03.045 --> 14:04.280
She seemed hurt.

14:09.919 --> 14:11.520
Why do you look so doomed?

14:11.553 --> 14:13.289
You knew about all this
evidence.

14:13.322 --> 14:14.523
We're not doomed.

14:16.993 --> 14:18.094
But, Katie...

14:19.228 --> 14:21.263
if you went into that
building that night...

14:23.065 --> 14:25.067
I'm not accusing you
of the murder,

14:25.101 --> 14:27.970
but if you went into that
building at all,

14:28.004 --> 14:32.174
I prefer we--
we admit it and deal with it.

14:33.342 --> 14:35.277
I did not go
into the building.

14:37.613 --> 14:38.715
I'm sorry.

14:40.082 --> 14:41.417
I had to ask.

14:41.450 --> 14:43.285
Please don't ask me again.

14:44.754 --> 14:46.288
Jimmy, could you
give us a second?

15:02.438 --> 15:03.873
I think I need to explain.

15:05.474 --> 15:07.476
Over the last
few months, I've...

15:13.916 --> 15:15.551
I've grown fond of you,
Katie.

15:19.121 --> 15:20.156
Lately, uh--

15:22.424 --> 15:24.661
I tell you this not
as some kind of advance.

15:24.694 --> 15:26.295
I'm very happily married.

15:27.229 --> 15:28.831
I love my wife totally.

15:33.435 --> 15:35.237
But since
I do have feelings...

15:37.874 --> 15:40.009
...I have to be conscious
of the reality

15:40.042 --> 15:42.011
that my judgment could be
colored.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.748
It's for that reason
I just asked you
that question.

15:48.217 --> 15:50.920
So the distrust you feel
isn't so much for you...

15:52.321 --> 15:54.724
as it is for my own
objectiveness.

16:02.131 --> 16:04.000
Do I need to get
a different lawyer?

16:07.837 --> 16:08.838
No.

16:15.344 --> 16:16.578
When I saw him...

16:18.915 --> 16:22.351
the sudden thought of having
to sit through the trial,

16:22.384 --> 16:24.654
looking at him every day...

16:26.222 --> 16:29.659
(sighs)
I just can't do it.

16:29.692 --> 16:32.061
You don't have to apologize
for being afraid.

16:32.895 --> 16:35.798
It's not just fear, Lucy.

16:35.832 --> 16:37.366
I'm 83.

16:37.399 --> 16:40.269
I haven't many years
to live.

16:40.302 --> 16:44.807
I don't want to spend
one of them embroiled--

16:48.911 --> 16:51.580
I think I could
survive this best...

16:52.982 --> 16:58.420
if I could somehow
bring myself to forgive him...

16:59.421 --> 17:00.857
...and move on.

17:01.323 --> 17:02.491
Okay.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.862
Any way I can help you?

17:07.296 --> 17:09.932
You could make him
apologize.

17:14.136 --> 17:16.906
I've been a police
criminologist for 11 years.

17:16.939 --> 17:20.009
KENNETH: And what findings,
if any, did you make, doctor?

17:20.041 --> 17:22.278
This was not a suicide.

17:22.310 --> 17:24.480
Can you tell the court
what psychological evidence

17:24.512 --> 17:26.214
led you to this conclusion?

17:26.248 --> 17:28.384
In the days
leading up the death,

17:28.416 --> 17:31.087
Mr. Potter was very
driven at work--

17:31.120 --> 17:32.621
even productive.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.256
He was meeting deadlines.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.025
This kind of efficiency

17:36.058 --> 17:39.461
belies the notion of a man
intending to end his life.

17:40.262 --> 17:41.798
He was getting therapy,

17:41.831 --> 17:45.401
both personally
and marital counseling.

17:45.434 --> 17:48.204
This, again, suggests
that he was looking to heal,

17:48.237 --> 17:51.307
move ahead, not die.

17:51.340 --> 17:52.809
The main thing--

17:54.176 --> 17:55.745
he left no note.

17:55.778 --> 17:58.915
If guilt is the motivating
factor for suicide,

17:58.948 --> 18:02.785
in my experience,
there's almost always a note.

18:02.819 --> 18:05.354
BOBBY: Doctor,
you have known cases

18:05.387 --> 18:07.523
where suicides
have not been planned out.

18:07.556 --> 18:10.960
The victim acts
on a sudden decision.
Yes.

18:10.993 --> 18:13.529
Even in cases where people
are on the mend, getting help,

18:13.562 --> 18:14.764
productive at work.

18:14.797 --> 18:15.965
That's not the usual.

18:15.998 --> 18:17.466
But it's been known to happen.

18:17.499 --> 18:19.301
People just snap.

18:19.335 --> 18:21.871
Those cases usually involve
schizophrenia

18:21.904 --> 18:23.706
or chemical problems.

18:23.740 --> 18:25.607
Neither is indicated
with Mr. Potter.

18:25.642 --> 18:27.910
But it's happened?
Of course.

18:27.944 --> 18:31.447
There's anecdotal evidence
for almost everything, but--

18:31.480 --> 18:33.549
Thank you.
I'd like to finish
my response, please.

18:33.582 --> 18:37.119
You answered my question.
No, I'm telling you
I haven't answered it.

18:37.153 --> 18:39.488
Is suicide possible here?

18:39.521 --> 18:42.191
Of course, it is.
Anything's possible.

18:42.224 --> 18:45.594
But based on my 17 years
as a trained professional

18:45.627 --> 18:47.429
dealing with
this very question,

18:47.463 --> 18:51.167
I am adamant in my belief
that this man was murdered.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.769
It's not even
a difficult call.

18:55.972 --> 18:57.740
I'm scared, Bobby.

18:57.774 --> 19:00.076
We haven't even put on
our defense yet.

19:00.109 --> 19:02.712
But our whole defense is
basically my word.

19:02.745 --> 19:03.980
The way the jurors
are looking at me--

19:04.013 --> 19:05.414
What did we say
about panic?

19:05.447 --> 19:08.050
We can't have panic.

19:08.084 --> 19:10.219
What if I get scared
during my testimony?

19:10.252 --> 19:11.620
It might make me
look guilty.

19:11.654 --> 19:14.056
What if I get nervous
and I can't remember?

19:14.090 --> 19:17.559
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Come on.

19:26.836 --> 19:29.405
Jimmy, tell Rebecca
to revisit Potter's therapist.

19:29.438 --> 19:32.508
Remind him privilege doesn't
survive his patient's death.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.210
I think she did that.

19:34.243 --> 19:35.678
Tell her to try harder!

19:36.946 --> 19:38.748
This man was treating
the guy for depression.

19:38.781 --> 19:41.017
He's bound to have
something we can use.

19:41.050 --> 19:42.985
If he doesn't agree,
slap him with a summons.

19:43.019 --> 19:45.587
I want him in that chair.

19:47.456 --> 19:48.791
Okay.

19:56.933 --> 19:59.468
The breakup
was very painful.

19:59.501 --> 20:01.370
I don't deny that.

20:01.403 --> 20:03.605
We've heard testimony
that you repeatedly

20:03.640 --> 20:06.442
tried to change his mind.

20:06.475 --> 20:09.912
That you would show up
at his office... unannounced.

20:09.946 --> 20:11.480
I did.

20:12.448 --> 20:13.615
I was hurting.

20:14.884 --> 20:17.319
In the days leading up
to Bernard's death,

20:17.353 --> 20:20.156
did you notice
any suicidal tendencies?

20:20.189 --> 20:22.992
The only strange thing
was the phone call.

20:23.025 --> 20:25.427
What phone call was that?

20:25.461 --> 20:28.230
About 40 minutes
prior to his death,

20:28.264 --> 20:29.799
he telephoned me.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.002
He said he would
never see me again.

20:34.070 --> 20:35.537
He said goodbye.

20:36.605 --> 20:37.874
And he hung up.

20:40.042 --> 20:41.310
It seemed very odd,

20:41.343 --> 20:43.179
and his voice sounded
slightly erratic.

20:44.446 --> 20:45.748
What did you do then?

20:45.782 --> 20:47.083
I tried to call him back.

20:47.116 --> 20:50.186
The call didn't go through,
and I never got him.

20:50.219 --> 20:54.156
And the next thing,
I'm told he's dead.

20:57.226 --> 20:58.427
Ms. Dafoe...

21:00.262 --> 21:03.565
Did you go to Bernard Potter's
building that night?

21:03.599 --> 21:05.802
I absolutely did not.

21:05.835 --> 21:07.804
Did you go anywhere
that night?

21:07.837 --> 21:09.438
No, I stayed at home.

21:09.471 --> 21:11.207
You're sitting
in this courtroom today...

21:12.174 --> 21:14.711
...accused of murder.

21:14.744 --> 21:17.246
I committed adultery...

21:18.347 --> 21:19.615
...with Bernard Potter,

21:19.649 --> 21:21.417
for which
I'm very much ashamed.

21:23.419 --> 21:25.587
And as I said,
I feel guilty...

21:28.257 --> 21:30.727
and I take responsibility
for what happened to his wife,

21:30.760 --> 21:32.261
but I didn't kill him.

21:33.696 --> 21:36.265
I-I could never be capable
of such a crime with anyone.

21:37.599 --> 21:39.435
Especially someone
that I loved.

21:46.175 --> 21:47.476
So, it was him.

21:47.509 --> 21:49.545
Yes.

21:49.578 --> 21:51.147
And maybe in time
she'll change her mind,

21:51.180 --> 21:54.216
but for now she doesn't want
the ordeal of a trial.

21:54.250 --> 21:56.953
Well, she'd only have to be
there for her testimony.

21:56.986 --> 21:58.721
But he'd have to be
in the room, right?

22:00.389 --> 22:02.524
And she wants him
to apologize?

22:02.558 --> 22:04.593
What are you hatching up?

22:04.626 --> 22:07.529
We get that apology on tape,
we don't need her ID.

22:08.698 --> 22:11.668
Go tell him he'll be made
by the woman

22:11.701 --> 22:13.803
unless he apologizes.

22:13.836 --> 22:17.006
Whoa, I'm a rape counselor,
not a police agent.

22:17.039 --> 22:19.676
Well, I think that your client
would feel comforted

22:19.709 --> 22:21.377
if we can put
the rapist in jail.

22:25.081 --> 22:26.548
So, you just happened to get

22:26.582 --> 22:28.885
a very strange call
from Bernard Potter

22:28.918 --> 22:30.552
shortly before his death?

22:30.586 --> 22:33.790
"Never going to see you again.
Goodbye."

22:33.823 --> 22:35.257
Yes.

22:35.291 --> 22:36.693
And you tried
to call him back?

22:36.726 --> 22:38.560
Several times.

22:38.594 --> 22:41.731
Why are there no phone records
of any such returned calls?

22:41.764 --> 22:45.267
Because the message center picks
up after the sixth call,

22:45.301 --> 22:47.303
and I typically hang up
after five.

22:47.336 --> 22:49.105
I see.

22:49.138 --> 22:52.374
Ever take a lesson
in how to shoot a gun?

22:53.442 --> 22:54.610
Yes.

22:54.644 --> 22:56.012
When?

22:56.045 --> 23:00.116
About a month before
Bernard Potter's death.

23:00.149 --> 23:03.285
Just thought it might be wise
to know how to shoot a gun?

23:03.319 --> 23:06.422
A lot of women look into
personal protection, Mr. Walsh.

23:08.090 --> 23:10.960
You say that isn't you?
It isn't.

23:10.993 --> 23:13.863
You've been seen wearing
that type of overcoat
many times,

23:13.896 --> 23:16.232
haven't you, Ms. Dafoe?

23:16.265 --> 23:19.635
Thousands and thousands
of women in Boston

23:19.669 --> 23:21.871
wear that style of overcoat.

23:21.904 --> 23:24.641
What happened to yours?
We couldn't find it.

23:26.108 --> 23:27.810
I-I threw it out.

23:28.711 --> 23:29.712
When?

23:30.713 --> 23:32.181
I have no idea.

23:33.282 --> 23:34.583
I buy a lot of new clothes,

23:34.616 --> 23:36.052
and I throw out
the old ones.

23:36.085 --> 23:37.386
Where did you throw it out?

23:37.419 --> 23:40.790
Just... in the garbage.

23:40.823 --> 23:43.860
Didn't give it to a friend
or the Salvation Army?

23:43.893 --> 23:45.461
You just threw it away?

23:46.062 --> 23:47.196
Yes.

23:47.229 --> 23:48.731
There are witnesses
that have seen you

23:48.765 --> 23:50.132
wearing that coat
as recently

23:50.166 --> 23:51.868
as a few weeks
before the shooting.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.236
I would think that if you were
wearing it that recently,

23:54.270 --> 23:56.405
it had to be in decent shape.

23:56.438 --> 23:57.907
But you just threw it out?

23:57.940 --> 23:59.408
Asked and answered.

23:59.441 --> 24:03.612
You had a coat like that
shortly before the murder.

24:03.646 --> 24:06.548
It couldn't be found
after the murder.

24:17.159 --> 24:20.629
I'll say it one more time--
we have to plead this.

24:20.663 --> 24:22.732
What else did
Potter's therapist say?

24:22.765 --> 24:24.166
Just that.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.670
But if he's called,
he will reject the idea
of suicide.

24:27.704 --> 24:30.006
So I don't think
he's worth it.

24:32.508 --> 24:34.610
I'm gonna call him.
It's too dangerous.

24:34.644 --> 24:35.845
You saw what happened
in there!

24:35.878 --> 24:37.213
Even so.

24:37.246 --> 24:40.016
You don't start winging
it halfway through a trial.

24:40.049 --> 24:42.351
Come on!
Bobby...

24:42.384 --> 24:43.920
I agree with Jimmy.

24:46.923 --> 24:48.057
I'm calling him.

24:51.460 --> 24:54.296
I'd have to let him
back into my home?

24:54.330 --> 24:56.999
With me here and the police
in adjoining apartments,

24:57.033 --> 24:58.868
also in the hall.

24:58.901 --> 25:00.602
I promise you'll be safe.

25:00.636 --> 25:03.039
(sighs)

25:03.072 --> 25:04.907
(voice wavering)
I don't know.

25:04.941 --> 25:10.179
It's totally your decision,
and I understand if you say no.

25:10.212 --> 25:14.751
I'm just saying if your fear
really is a long trial,

25:14.784 --> 25:17.019
it'll only take a few minutes.

25:17.053 --> 25:19.555
You'll get your apology,
and you'll put him in jail.

25:20.289 --> 25:21.791
And you'll be here with me?

25:21.824 --> 25:22.925
Every minute.

25:24.794 --> 25:26.696
Could lose my job, but...

25:26.729 --> 25:28.965
Why would you lose your job?

25:28.998 --> 25:30.967
Well, this isn't exactly
what rape counselors

25:31.000 --> 25:32.468
are supposed to be doing.

25:34.671 --> 25:36.138
He was extremely guilt ridden

25:36.172 --> 25:38.074
over the pain
he caused his wife.

25:38.107 --> 25:40.176
Let's be candid.

25:40.209 --> 25:42.378
You don't think it was
a suicide?

25:42.411 --> 25:44.814
I don't think he was
remotely suicidal.

25:44.847 --> 25:48.217
Dr. Papp, during your therapy
with Bernard Potter,

25:48.250 --> 25:50.552
he discussed his affair
with Katie Dafoe?

25:50.586 --> 25:52.021
He did.

25:52.054 --> 25:55.658
Did he ever discuss having
an affair with anybody else

25:55.692 --> 25:57.927
around the time of his death?

26:01.698 --> 26:03.065
Yes.

26:03.099 --> 26:04.466
Who?

26:05.467 --> 26:07.303
His secretary,
Michelle Farrell.

26:13.643 --> 26:16.078
When did this affair end,
if you know?

26:16.112 --> 26:17.446
Objection, hearsay.

26:17.479 --> 26:18.815
Overruled.

26:18.848 --> 26:22.251
When did Mr. Potter's affair
with Ms. Farrell end?

26:22.284 --> 26:24.687
About a week before his death.

26:25.421 --> 26:26.488
Thank you.

26:29.425 --> 26:30.559
Mr. Walsh?

26:31.627 --> 26:32.729
I have no questions,

26:32.762 --> 26:34.396
but reserve the right
to recall.

26:34.430 --> 26:36.598
Witness may step down.

26:36.632 --> 26:38.901
The Defense recalls
Michelle Farrell.

26:38.935 --> 26:40.402
Your Honor,
I'd like some time,

26:40.436 --> 26:42.038
in light of this new
information.

26:42.071 --> 26:45.541
We'll break for the day,
resume tomorrow
with Ms. Farrell.

26:45.574 --> 26:46.809
(gavel raps)

26:50.813 --> 26:53.015
If anything happens,
we'll be in in three seconds.

26:53.049 --> 26:56.118
Okay. Well, I'll be out in
three seconds, so don't worry.

26:56.152 --> 26:57.419
Good luck.

27:09.565 --> 27:10.867
Mr. Macklin.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.935
My name is Lucy Hatcher.

27:12.969 --> 27:14.804
I'm from Rape Crisis.

27:14.837 --> 27:17.339
I'm the counselor for
the elderly woman you raped.

27:17.373 --> 27:19.308
I don't know what you're
talking about.

27:20.843 --> 27:22.044
I think you do.

27:23.179 --> 27:25.247
She made you
in a police lineup yesterday.

27:26.348 --> 27:28.150
Only so far, she's
keeping it to herself,

27:28.184 --> 27:31.053
since as a Christian woman,
she believes in forgiveness.

27:32.121 --> 27:33.656
You got lucky.

27:33.690 --> 27:37.059
But she only plans to forgive
you if you repent.

27:38.194 --> 27:39.662
You know her address.

27:39.696 --> 27:42.331
Show up tomorrow at noon,
tell the woman you're sorry,

27:42.364 --> 27:43.866
and be sorry...

27:43.900 --> 27:45.735
or she goes to the police.

27:57.213 --> 27:59.849
So you're going to accuse
the secretary?

28:01.150 --> 28:02.852
I'm gonna
throw it out there.

28:02.885 --> 28:05.621
She doesn't have a complete
alibi, so who knows?

28:05.655 --> 28:07.356
It seems a little desperate.

28:07.389 --> 28:09.058
Well, we are desperate,
Lindsay.

28:09.091 --> 28:10.993
I mean,
Katie didn't do so well.

28:11.027 --> 28:12.795
And the business of
the overcoat...

28:12.829 --> 28:14.596
Did you ask her what
she did with the overcoat?

28:14.630 --> 28:16.799
She was asked three times.
She threw it out.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.036
No, I don't mean
on the stand.

28:20.069 --> 28:22.705
I mean after,
in private.

28:24.606 --> 28:26.108
You didn't ask?

28:26.142 --> 28:27.877
I believe she threw it out.

28:31.447 --> 28:32.614
What?

28:33.850 --> 28:35.317
Are you involved
with her, Bobby?

28:37.253 --> 28:38.320
What?!

28:38.354 --> 28:40.522
Look, I mean, it jus--

28:40.556 --> 28:42.058
It might just be
my hormones, I'm sorry.

28:42.091 --> 28:43.525
But I just get
this weird feeling

28:43.559 --> 28:45.594
that something's going on.

28:45.627 --> 28:47.997
I mean, the way
you just believe her?

28:48.030 --> 28:49.699
You believe something's
going on?

28:49.732 --> 28:50.833
I'm just...

28:52.601 --> 28:54.336
Wondering, Lindsay?

28:54.370 --> 28:56.005
(sighs)

28:57.907 --> 28:59.075
Sorry.

29:02.244 --> 29:03.846
You know me better than that.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.414
I know.
I'm just...

29:07.283 --> 29:08.785
Maybe I'm just fried.

29:10.987 --> 29:12.288
Goodnight.

29:26.903 --> 29:30.006
Why didn't you tell
the police about your
affair with Mr. Potter?

29:30.039 --> 29:31.607
It wasn't relevant.

29:31.641 --> 29:34.777
You break up with him a week
before he's found dead--

29:34.811 --> 29:37.479
"It wasn't relevant"?
No.

29:37.513 --> 29:40.349
You were asked point-blank
by Rebecca Washington,

29:40.382 --> 29:43.485
seated right over there,
whether Mr. Potter was having
any other affairs,

29:43.519 --> 29:46.355
and you answered, to the best
of your knowledge, "No."

29:46.388 --> 29:48.490
It's my private life.

29:48.524 --> 29:50.893
Ms. Farrell,
did you kill your boss?

29:50.927 --> 29:52.128
KENNETH: Objection!
What?

29:52.161 --> 29:54.330
You had the opportunity,
the motive.

29:54.363 --> 29:55.832
How tall are you?

29:55.865 --> 29:57.133
This is ridiculous!

29:57.166 --> 29:58.868
How tall are you?

30:00.036 --> 30:01.337
I'm five-four.

30:03.906 --> 30:05.507
Your Honor, with the court's
permission, I'd like the witness

30:05.541 --> 30:08.410
to step out of the witness chair
for a demonstration.

30:08.444 --> 30:11.848
I object!
Ms. Farrell,
please step out.

30:17.854 --> 30:20.189
Stand just like this, please.

30:22.458 --> 30:23.726
Could you put this on, please?

30:23.760 --> 30:25.394
I object
to this grandstanding.

30:25.427 --> 30:28.630
Overruled.
Ms. Farrell,
put the coat on.

30:32.534 --> 30:34.036
And these glasses, please.

30:38.340 --> 30:39.508
And the wig.

30:43.445 --> 30:44.546
Katie?

30:50.186 --> 30:55.057
I'd like you to...
stand just like this.

31:12.775 --> 31:14.343
From where I'm standing...

31:16.445 --> 31:17.914
...I see reasonable doubt.

31:26.856 --> 31:28.557
What happens now?

31:28.590 --> 31:31.393
They cross her,
establish her alibi.

31:31.427 --> 31:32.762
She has one?

31:33.730 --> 31:35.197
She was at a movie
and can account

31:35.231 --> 31:37.099
for most of the night,
not all of it.

31:38.567 --> 31:40.036
How did it play?

31:41.337 --> 31:42.504
Honest?

31:43.572 --> 31:45.174
A little desperate.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.608
It could blow up
in your face.

31:47.777 --> 31:49.912
All I need is one juror.

31:49.946 --> 31:51.580
You and Perry Mason.

31:58.587 --> 31:59.588
Jimmy...

32:01.590 --> 32:03.726
I don't want to hear that crap
in front of the client!

32:03.760 --> 32:06.428
You asked my opinion
in front of the client.

32:06.462 --> 32:07.730
Do you have a problem?

32:07.764 --> 32:11.033
Do I have a problem?
I got a big problem.

32:11.067 --> 32:12.935
I think you have feelings
for this woman,

32:12.969 --> 32:14.603
and you're not seeing
straight.

32:14.636 --> 32:16.172
That's my problem.

32:17.206 --> 32:18.841
(knock on door)

32:33.122 --> 32:35.157
Is it just a game to you,
Mr. Donnell?

32:36.358 --> 32:38.194
Somebody died here.

32:38.227 --> 32:39.528
That was real.

32:41.330 --> 32:42.665
It's not a game.

32:57.046 --> 32:58.648
(knock on door)

33:02.518 --> 33:03.485
Are you sure you're ready?

33:03.519 --> 33:04.921
I'm fine.

33:18.935 --> 33:20.202
Are you okay?

33:20.236 --> 33:21.403
Yes.

33:24.306 --> 33:25.574
(clears throat)

33:28.144 --> 33:30.980
Look, I know you think I did it,
but I didn't do it.

33:34.616 --> 33:37.219
But I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

33:41.758 --> 33:44.727
Is that your idea
of seeking forgiveness?

33:46.863 --> 33:48.998
You don't think I know?

33:49.031 --> 33:51.100
I looked you in the eye.

33:51.133 --> 33:54.203
You don't think I know
you're the man who raped me?

33:55.304 --> 33:56.438
I'm sorry.

33:56.472 --> 33:58.274
(chuckles)

33:58.307 --> 33:59.842
You're sorry?

34:00.910 --> 34:03.412
My husband was a minister.

34:03.445 --> 34:04.981
Bet you didn't know that.

34:07.049 --> 34:10.585
Did you ever think you were
raping a minister's wife?

34:17.359 --> 34:18.828
(screams)

34:22.231 --> 34:23.866
(door opens)

34:29.505 --> 34:31.808
(crying)

34:34.275 --> 34:37.379
I know you would have liked
to have the confession first.

34:40.181 --> 34:42.685
But I just didn't
see the need for it.

34:49.391 --> 34:53.529
None of the police experts
could rule out suicide.

34:53.562 --> 34:56.398
The man was
profoundly depressed.

34:56.431 --> 34:58.467
He crippled his wife,

34:58.500 --> 35:02.604
a woman who loved walking like
she loved life.

35:02.638 --> 35:06.242
He was being clinically treated
for this depression.

35:06.275 --> 35:11.013
None of us-- none of you--
can eliminate the possibility

35:11.047 --> 35:13.916
that Bernard Potter
took his own life.

35:13.950 --> 35:16.686
The only reason the police
arrested Katie Dafoe

35:16.719 --> 35:19.188
was because she seemingly
had motive.

35:19.221 --> 35:21.357
Hairs of hers were found
at the scene,

35:21.390 --> 35:24.260
a woman who looked like her
was seen leaving the building.

35:24.293 --> 35:28.097
But Michelle Farrell
would also have motive.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.599
She, too, was having an affair.

35:30.632 --> 35:35.071
And how easy it would've been
for her to frame Katie Dafoe.

35:35.104 --> 35:37.940
She could've collected hairs
from my client's hairbrush

35:37.974 --> 35:40.743
and planted them,
dressed up to look like her.

35:40.777 --> 35:42.679
We all just saw
the resemblance.

35:42.712 --> 35:45.347
And she can't account
for her whereabouts

35:45.381 --> 35:48.818
for the hour immediately
preceding Mr. Potter's death.

35:48.851 --> 35:50.352
She says she was home,

35:50.386 --> 35:52.621
just like Katie insists
she was home.

35:53.355 --> 35:55.124
But we can't know.

35:56.292 --> 35:57.359
Add to that the fact that

35:57.393 --> 35:59.628
we can't even know it was
homicide at all.

36:02.264 --> 36:05.201
You've certainly got
reasonable doubt.

36:08.570 --> 36:11.808
Our detectives,
our forensic specialists,

36:11.841 --> 36:13.409
our psychological experts--

36:13.442 --> 36:15.645
all of our witnesses--

36:15.678 --> 36:19.515
all of them were unequivocal
in their consensus.

36:19.548 --> 36:21.851
This was a homicide.

36:21.884 --> 36:25.354
There was no gunshot residue
on the victim's hands.

36:25.387 --> 36:28.157
The trajectory shows that
he was shot from above,

36:28.190 --> 36:29.358
from slightly behind,

36:29.391 --> 36:32.561
which is totally inconsistent
with suicide.

36:32.594 --> 36:34.396
Bernard Potter was murdered.

36:35.597 --> 36:37.800
It's obvious,
and the defense knows it.

36:37.834 --> 36:40.602
That's why they resorted
to that ridiculous, last-second

36:40.636 --> 36:43.740
cloak-and-dagger stunt
of getting Mr. Potter's
secretary

36:43.773 --> 36:45.174
to dress up in the courtroom.

36:45.207 --> 36:46.876
True, we did not know

36:46.909 --> 36:48.911
of Ms. Farrell's affair
with the victim,

36:48.945 --> 36:51.413
but she is not a suspect
in this case.

36:51.447 --> 36:53.850
Mr. Donnell is throwing her up
as a red herring

36:53.883 --> 36:56.385
because he struck out
on the suicide pitch.

36:56.418 --> 37:00.156
The evidence here is
overwhelming.

37:02.324 --> 37:04.493
Ms. Dafoe had motive.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.196
She had been acting urgently,
frantically,

37:07.229 --> 37:09.298
showing up
at the victim's office,

37:09.331 --> 37:11.567
desperately trying to continue
the relationship.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.636
Her hair samples place her
at the scene.

37:14.671 --> 37:16.873
She had an elevator access key.

37:16.906 --> 37:19.942
She knew how to get in
and get out.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.644
And what of the overcoat?

37:23.212 --> 37:24.881
Where did it go?

37:24.914 --> 37:26.683
She just happened
to throw it away

37:26.716 --> 37:28.718
around the time of the murder?

37:28.751 --> 37:31.921
Like she just happened
to take shooting lessons

37:31.954 --> 37:33.756
three weeks before the murder.

37:34.824 --> 37:36.592
A woman bearing her resemblance

37:36.625 --> 37:39.128
just happens to be leaving
the building

37:39.161 --> 37:41.130
three minutes
after the shooting,

37:41.163 --> 37:44.033
wearing a coat just like one
owned by the defendant,

37:44.066 --> 37:48.037
which coat just happens to get
thrown away that very week.

37:50.272 --> 37:52.141
Come on.

37:52.174 --> 37:55.477
That's just a few too many
coincidences.

37:57.579 --> 37:58.848
Don't you think?

38:05.688 --> 38:08.290
Katie, remember what I said?

38:09.625 --> 38:10.693
My objectivity?

38:11.560 --> 38:12.762
It's okay, Bobby.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.364
I'm afraid
I may have blown it.

38:17.233 --> 38:19.769
By suddenly pointing my finger
at the secretary.

38:21.170 --> 38:23.706
I'm worried I may have sent
the message to the jury--

38:27.476 --> 38:29.378
I don't believe
it was suicide.

38:29.411 --> 38:32.148
Hey, Bobby...

38:33.983 --> 38:36.819
You tried an incredible case.

38:36.853 --> 38:38.755
You got every one
of their witnesses

38:38.788 --> 38:40.222
to admit it could be suicide.

38:41.490 --> 38:43.826
Plus, you offered another
possible scenario

38:43.860 --> 38:45.795
if the jury is determined
to conclude homicide.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.431
I don't question you at all.

38:53.502 --> 38:55.571
(door opens)

38:58.975 --> 39:00.176
Jury's back.

39:02.411 --> 39:04.546
(sighs deeply)

39:06.883 --> 39:09.251
JUDGE: The defendant
will please rise.

39:11.788 --> 39:13.622
Madam Foreperson...

39:13.656 --> 39:16.092
the jury has reached
a unanimous verdict?

39:16.125 --> 39:18.560
We have, Your Honor.
What say you?

39:20.029 --> 39:22.231
In the matter of
Commonwealth of Massachusetts

39:22.264 --> 39:26.703
vs. Katherine Dafoe
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

39:26.736 --> 39:30.139
we, the jury,
find the defendant,
Katherine Dafoe...

39:31.240 --> 39:33.309
...guilty.
(people gasping)

39:33.342 --> 39:34.744
JUDGE: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

39:34.777 --> 39:36.512
you are dismissed with
the thanks of the court.

39:36.545 --> 39:38.414
We are adjourned.
(gavel bangs)

39:41.250 --> 39:42.819
(crying)

39:47.456 --> 39:49.525
(gasping)
We'll appeal.

39:49.558 --> 39:51.427
We'll appeal.

39:51.460 --> 39:52.762
We'll appeal.

40:44.747 --> 40:47.249
(sighs)

40:47.283 --> 40:48.751
Are you in love
with her, Bobby?

40:52.288 --> 40:54.490
I'm not accusing you
of being unfaithful.

40:56.793 --> 40:58.661
I trust you completely.

40:58.695 --> 40:59.896
(voice breaking)
It's just, uh...

41:01.731 --> 41:05.301
Sometimes people fall in love,
whether they want to or not.

41:08.671 --> 41:10.139
I'm not in love with her.

41:14.711 --> 41:16.545
Something about her just...

41:20.349 --> 41:22.952
...made me feel
protective of her.

41:24.053 --> 41:25.988
(sighs deeply)

41:26.022 --> 41:28.024
And I'm devastated I lost.

41:28.057 --> 41:29.491
There's...

41:29.525 --> 41:32.261
(sighs)

41:39.601 --> 41:41.037
I'm in love with you.

41:46.542 --> 41:47.844
And only you.

41:55.251 --> 41:56.518
We're paid.

42:07.730 --> 42:10.900
Would you be upset
if I said I didn't want you
handling her appeal?

42:13.002 --> 42:14.871
Would you be upset
if I said I had to?

42:18.040 --> 42:19.241
Yes.

42:20.209 --> 42:23.545
Okay, then, I won't.

42:23.579 --> 42:26.649
There's just something
about her, Bobby.

42:26.683 --> 42:29.285
I just don't...
want you with her.

42:30.619 --> 42:32.154
Then that's that, then.

42:39.996 --> 42:41.530
I love you.

42:41.563 --> 42:42.865
I love you, too.

42:44.133 --> 42:45.935
But I don't feel like
saying it tonight.

42:47.136 --> 42:49.371
(sighs)

42:49.405 --> 42:51.140
Come on.
Let's go home.

43:30.947 --> 43:34.116
(music playing)

43:57.106 --> 43:58.340
You stinker!
