There had been
a follow-up,

11:26.219 --> 11:28.655
but before there could be,
he ran away.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.257
Lived on the streets,
first in Oakland.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.193
How old was he?
Mm. 16.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.763
Made some money with his muscle,
being a street enforcer.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.664
Someone always needs something
done on the streets,

11:37.697 --> 11:41.334
a debt collected
or an enemy taken care of.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.337
After a few years of that,
he moved to Palo Alto.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.673
Lots of returning
military personnel there,

11:46.706 --> 11:48.675
guys from Afghanistan
and Iraq.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.343
He made a lot of friends.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.847
A buddy of mine keeps
going back to Afghanistan.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.749
This is what he likes.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.854
Is that where you were?

12:00.888 --> 12:02.422
Some of those vets
were still active duty,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.091
some were homeless.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.961
A lot were connected to
the V.A. Hospital in Palo Alto.

12:07.995 --> 12:11.131
A number of those men
were addicted to street drugs

12:11.164 --> 12:12.966
that Darius
could get for them

12:13.000 --> 12:15.903
because of his connections
with the Oakland dealers.

12:15.936 --> 12:19.139
But then Darius started
using the same drugs himself,

12:19.172 --> 12:22.876
to the point that they, in his
words, "became a problem."

12:22.910 --> 12:26.113
That's when he showed up here
with his fake military I.D. card

12:26.146 --> 12:28.816
that one of the guys
had gotten him.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.217
Fake?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.119
An operator I worked
with in Kandahar...

12:32.152 --> 12:34.054
When I came back
from my last tour...

12:34.087 --> 12:35.455
I was in the Teams.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.391
We used to run these drills,
sneak and peek.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.160
You mean he had
a fake I.D.?

12:40.193 --> 12:42.395
Yes.
Very well-executed.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.997
Totally legitimate-looking.

12:44.031 --> 12:47.234
At first glance,
even at second glance, it was --

12:47.267 --> 12:51.238
You're saying he was
never in the military?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.040
I'm saying he was not.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.811
First thing that

and so does your plan.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.748
After that, you improvise.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.017
He was admitted
through emergency services.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.454
He was treated for
chronic substance abuse

13:07.487 --> 13:09.422
and psychotic ideation.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.291
He had managed to detox

13:11.324 --> 13:13.126
and was just starting
to work with me

13:13.160 --> 13:15.762
when the ruse
was discovered.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.131
Fake I.D.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.466
That's when the police
were called?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.168
Yeah.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.136
They took him
back to Napa.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.974
His family transferred him
to a private facility in Marin.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.209
I tried to reach out,
but they said

13:29.242 --> 13:31.478
that he'd run away again.

13:31.511 --> 13:34.948
That's the last
I heard of him until now.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.317

you said?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.120
I -- Yes.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.955
I'm glad.

13:41.989 --> 13:45.492
I actually argued for him
to stay here, but was overruled.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.794
I always wondered
what happened to him.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.163
But now, here you are.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
Darius turned me on
to that one.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.546

14:40.547 --> 14:44.351

14:44.384 --> 14:46.553
They'll have him put away,

14:46.586 --> 14:48.355
They can't.
He's an adult.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.190
What if they give him
some drugs?

14:50.223 --> 14:52.425
Hmm?
And get him to sign something?

14:52.459 --> 14:55.028
No. Then he'll argue
that he was drugged.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.030
It's almost impossible
in this day and age

14:57.064 --> 14:58.565
to gain that kind
of conservatorship

14:58.598 --> 15:01.134

15:17.084 --> 15:18.551

about putting him away?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.087
I don't know.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.289
But he's been looking
for him for years.

15:22.322 --> 15:25.458
So, whatever
the reason, he cares.

Jaclyn Blackstone to you,

to see Dr. Cohen's records?

19:31.704 --> 19:35.475

what happened to her?

19:35.508 --> 19:38.545
Uh, yeah. Not all of it.

he stalked and harassed
you and your friend,

21:48.675 --> 21:51.310
Good thing is,

21:51.344 --> 21:54.447

going after another cop

21:54.481 --> 21:56.849

you're gonna help me?

22:03.856 --> 22:06.526

22:06.559 --> 22:07.960
look into it
and see what I find out,

22:07.994 --> 22:09.962
but let me tell you,
it's not gonna be easy.

22:09.996 --> 22:12.799

Oh, all right.

23:59.105 --> 24:04.577
So, we're looking at trauma
to the brain, structural damage.

24:04.611 --> 24:07.814
There's no evidence of that
according to the MRI.

24:07.847 --> 24:11.518
We're still waiting on an EEG
for signs of swelling.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.786
But the good news is that
he didn't have a seizure,

24:13.820 --> 24:16.689
there's no cardiac arrest,
no cerebral anoxia.

24:16.723 --> 24:20.426
Was his brain ever
without any oxygen?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.828
No.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.431
We expect him
to make a full recovery.

I would hope that your son
would be more consistent

My son cannot

24:59.766 --> 25:02.802
Can he be transported
in his current state?

25:02.835 --> 25:06.573
I would say
that is not advisable.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.874
Good.

No, I can't.

about my son's history.

My son is dangerous.

36:06.332 --> 36:11.303
Yeah, no, she's beautiful,
but she was also just --

36:11.337 --> 36:13.339
Some of the others,
they don't like

36:13.372 --> 36:15.140
to go with me so much
'cause of my scars.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.243
But she didn't care
about that at all.

36:17.276 --> 36:18.544
Mm-hmm.
Last time I saw her,

36:18.577 --> 36:21.380
she called me to see
if we could meet.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.148
And did you?

36:23.181 --> 36:25.817
At the sports bar
on the boulevard,

36:25.851 --> 36:28.820
she was acting weird,
really paranoid.

36:28.854 --> 36:32.157
She started telling me
this kind of wild story.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.859
I didn't know
how much to believe.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.495
Well, what was the story?

36:36.528 --> 36:40.899
About this guy, this doctor
she knew from Oakland.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.202
He'd told her he was
gonna help her get clean,

36:44.236 --> 36:47.339
but he took her back
to the Bay Area,

36:47.373 --> 36:48.840
and then, when he got there,

36:48.874 --> 36:51.710
he just wanted her
for some kind of sex slave.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.512
So, what happened?
What did he do?

36:53.545 --> 36:55.281
He wanted to tie her up,

36:55.314 --> 36:59.385
but she talked him into
letting her tie him up instead.

36:59.418 --> 37:02.854
And then she busted him
in the head and got away.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.856
That's all she said.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.193
I guess it was
his phone she called me on.

37:08.226 --> 37:09.728
She thought that
I could help her run

37:09.761 --> 37:12.598
because my sister's
a travel agent.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.301
But I told her I couldn't
have Lori involved

37:15.334 --> 37:16.602
in something like that.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.637
I told her she should
turn herself in,

37:18.670 --> 37:20.205
that people would understand

37:20.238 --> 37:22.741
if she just, you know,
explained what happened.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.610
And what did she say?

37:24.643 --> 37:27.913
[ Scoffs ] Nothing.
She left.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.518
[ Door closes ]

37:56.542 --> 37:58.844
[ Car door closes ]

38:02.280 --> 38:05.451
You were right, Woody.
That was the right thing.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.786
I don't feel right.

38:12.891 --> 38:15.761
[ Siren wailing in distance ]

who just came in.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.712
First door on the left.

39:12.618 --> 39:17.856
Well, she was just,
you know, kind.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.825
She was so patient.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.860
She used to be a teacher.

39:21.893 --> 39:24.663
Sometimes I'd --
I'd pay her a little extra

39:24.696 --> 39:26.598
to help me with
my homework afterwards.

39:26.632 --> 39:27.699
[ Laughter ]

39:27.733 --> 39:28.734
I'm having this problem

39:28.767 --> 39:31.002
with this breadth requirement,

39:31.036 --> 39:33.705
this class I had to pass,

39:33.739 --> 39:37.609
and I ended up getting
an A-plus because of her.

39:37.643 --> 39:39.445
I would have -- I would have
failed without her.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.847
She helped me with the math.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.583
[ Indistinct talking ]

39:48.887 --> 39:50.856
You know, I'll do whatever
you guys need me to do.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.358
I'll tell you anything I know.
I just --

39:53.391 --> 39:55.093
