00:53.974 --> 00:56.809
Hello there, is this the house?
I've been trying to get you.

00:57.019 --> 01:00.139
Michael, do you realize
it's 5:30 in the morning?

01:00.314 --> 01:03.149
- Who is it, Agatha?
- That Michael.

01:03.484 --> 01:07.647
We had a party last night and the last
guest hasn't driven out of the driveway.

01:07.821 --> 01:09.565
Take it. Take it.

01:09.740 --> 01:11.364
Hello? Kitchen.

01:11.533 --> 01:14.487
- Lucy speaking. Yes, Miss Ann.
- Yes, I know. I know.

01:14.662 --> 01:17.995
What's that racket? The telephone's
been ringing all over the house.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.493
I'll talk to him.

01:21.543 --> 01:24.628
Michael, what do you mean
at this unholy hour of the morning?

01:26.173 --> 01:27.715
Well, good morning, Miss Ann.

01:27.883 --> 01:31.797
Cheerful morning, isn't it? I was
wondering if I might talk to Miss Judith.

01:31.970 --> 01:35.090
No, you certainly might not.
She hasn't had two hours' sleep yet.

01:35.265 --> 01:38.017
I wouldn't disturb her for the world.

01:57.705 --> 02:00.789
This is Miss Judith Traherne
of the sleepy Trahernes.

02:01.000 --> 02:05.163
Is it, now? Well, this is Mr. Michael
O'Leary of the wide-awake O'Learys.

02:05.337 --> 02:09.169
You have a cash customer for the colt.
We can get 10,000 if you're quick.

02:09.341 --> 02:11.548
If you mean Challenger,
not 10 and not 20.

02:11.719 --> 02:13.925
My head's just woozy, not vacant.

02:14.096 --> 02:16.587
If you don't mind my saying so,
Miss Judith...

02:16.765 --> 02:19.173
it's better if you take charge
of the ribbons...

02:19.351 --> 02:21.510
and leave the handling
of the horses to me.

02:21.687 --> 02:25.471
I do mind your saying so. I gave you
your orders last night, Michael.

02:26.734 --> 02:28.857
I ought to slap that man's face.

02:29.528 --> 02:31.734
He's impertinent sometimes,
but what can we do?

02:31.905 --> 02:33.898
He's about the best trainer
money can buy.

02:34.074 --> 02:36.363
- I suppose he is. What time is it?
- About 5:30.

02:36.535 --> 02:40.118
Good morning, Martha.
Hello, Daffy, come on.

02:40.289 --> 02:42.365
- We're going to the stable, Martha.
- Are we?

02:42.541 --> 02:44.949
Couldn't you go back to bed
and get a little sleep?

02:45.127 --> 02:48.543
- Will you get us some coffee, Martha?
- Yes, miss.

02:51.759 --> 02:53.169
Well...

02:53.344 --> 02:55.217
here we go. Come.

03:00.059 --> 03:02.632
- You asleep?
- It's a nice world if we can stay in it.

03:02.811 --> 03:04.685
- What do you mean?
- Better let me drive.

03:04.855 --> 03:05.934
- No!
- Give me that.

03:06.106 --> 03:07.814
I will not.

03:12.112 --> 03:13.393
Good morning, ladies.

03:13.572 --> 03:16.063
- Oh, I managed to get you up, did I?
- Don't be fresh.

03:16.241 --> 03:18.649
I hear you've got the finest horses
in the country.

03:18.827 --> 03:21.318
Least you could do
is let them have a look at you.

03:21.497 --> 03:24.166
Surely if the horses can get up early
to run and jump...

03:24.333 --> 03:25.875
you can get up to watch them.

03:26.043 --> 03:28.036
Michael, really!

03:30.297 --> 03:32.124
- Hello, Judith.
- Hello!

03:32.466 --> 03:35.337
- Hello, Jones!
- We're gonna be killed someday.

03:35.969 --> 03:39.136
- Ann, come here.
- Thanks for the lift.

03:40.307 --> 03:41.766
Take it away, Bob.

03:41.934 --> 03:43.725
- I wouldn't stand for it.
- I won't.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.469
- He's got to be fired. Right now.
- He's going to be.

03:46.647 --> 03:49.316
Thinks he can lead us around
like horses. Ann, fire him.

03:49.483 --> 03:52.400
Me? I'm not the mistress here,
I'm only the secretary.

03:52.569 --> 03:56.863
But, darling, you have the character.
You're always telling me so yourself.

03:57.199 --> 03:58.527
- Judy!
- Hello, everybody.

03:58.701 --> 03:59.981
Good morning, Alec!

04:00.160 --> 04:02.830
- Oh, what a party.
- Glad to see you're still on it.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.951
All ready for tonight.
All I gotta do is change the orchid.

04:06.125 --> 04:09.375
- Good morning, Ann. Nice, sensible Ann.
- Good morning, parasite.

04:09.545 --> 04:12.214
Why not go to bed before
they put you there for good?

04:12.506 --> 04:14.582
Well, now, confidentially,
it's a scheme.

04:14.758 --> 04:17.712
Your man Michael told me
he'd give me a nice fat commission...

04:17.886 --> 04:21.053
if I can get our sweet Carrie
to buy your colt, Challenger.

04:21.223 --> 04:23.014
- Michael?
- And I can use the cash.

04:23.183 --> 04:25.223
- This is the end!
- Judy, darling.

04:25.394 --> 04:28.727
I will take that colt off your hands
if you'll let me have a bargain.

04:28.897 --> 04:31.649
I won't sell the horse,
but I'll sell his trainer.

04:31.817 --> 04:34.984
That's who she really wants to buy,
but he won't even look at her.

04:35.154 --> 04:37.561
- I've never heard of such a thing!
- Judith...

04:37.740 --> 04:41.109
- ...do you want to sell that colt?
- No, I do not! Colonel, dear.

04:41.285 --> 04:44.239
I think you ought to buy him, colonel.
He's a perfect darling.

04:44.413 --> 04:45.991
You can even invite him for tea.

04:46.165 --> 04:49.368
He could play on your front lawn
with your children and your dogs.

04:49.543 --> 04:51.370
He's a love. He whinnies.

04:51.587 --> 04:56.415
Unfortunately, a steeplechaser has to
have more than just a pretty smile.

04:56.592 --> 05:00.376
Colonel Mantle, my father held
that foal up in his arms and said:

05:00.554 --> 05:02.677
"Judy, here's a champion. By Victory..."

05:02.848 --> 05:06.846
"Out of Field Nurse by Man O' War.
Let's call him Challenger."

05:07.561 --> 05:09.435
Catch that horse at the two-mile pole...

05:09.605 --> 05:12.274
with his heart bursting
and he'll fold up on you.

05:12.441 --> 05:16.770
Michael, you might fold up,
and I might fold up...

05:16.945 --> 05:18.938
but that horse has the breeding.

05:21.659 --> 05:23.450
That was for me, I take it.

05:23.619 --> 05:25.861
I told you I wanted to run him.
Where is he?

05:26.038 --> 05:29.870
- He's in his stall having his morning tea.
- Well, go bring him up here.

05:30.042 --> 05:31.916
When I tell you to do something, do it.

05:32.252 --> 05:34.162
Yes, mum.

05:41.637 --> 05:43.428
That head again?

05:43.597 --> 05:45.637
It comes and goes.

05:46.767 --> 05:50.812
- I'll show him if that horse has courage.
- What are you going to do?

05:56.402 --> 05:58.145
Michael...

05:58.320 --> 05:59.898
how long have I had you?

06:00.072 --> 06:03.856
- One month and three days.
- Remind me to think about firing you.

06:04.034 --> 06:07.403
I don't think you'll be firing me.
We're going to get on together.

06:07.579 --> 06:10.070
Just because I called
your little darling a coward...

06:10.249 --> 06:14.163
Someday, you'll learn
that courage is in the blood.

06:16.922 --> 06:19.081
Now, take your little horse
and run along.

06:49.163 --> 06:50.657
Good riding, Judy!

07:01.800 --> 07:03.959
What's the matter with him?
I haven't seen...

07:27.660 --> 07:30.910
- Well, how are you feeling now?
- Oh, fine.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.780
- How's the shoulder?
- All right.

07:35.084 --> 07:37.325
How you escaped being hurt,
I'll never know.

07:38.253 --> 07:41.254
- Ann, do you know something?
- What?

07:42.216 --> 07:44.671
That colt didn't throw me. I threw him.

07:46.095 --> 07:49.131
- What are you talking about?
- You know what happened?

07:49.306 --> 07:53.719
I saw two jumps.
I tried to take him over the wrong jump.

07:53.894 --> 07:56.266
You saw two jumps?

07:56.480 --> 07:57.974
Yes, that's what it was.

07:58.273 --> 08:00.764
It was the ghastliest feeling.
Everything went fuzzy.

08:00.943 --> 08:03.185
Why didn't you tell
Dr. Parsons these things?

08:03.362 --> 08:06.446
Oh, poor old befuddled Parsons.
You know what he always says:

08:06.615 --> 08:09.071
"My dear, you've been staying up
too late smoking."

08:09.243 --> 08:11.994
And the house is always filled
with gangs of people and...

08:12.162 --> 08:14.949
If only he knew what happened
last week at the Colony.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.079
What happened at the Colony?

08:18.252 --> 08:22.332
An old lady was coming through.
I knocked her umbrella out of her hand.

08:22.506 --> 08:24.748
- Why?
- Someone said I was drunk.

08:24.925 --> 08:27.712
Another time, coming out
of Helene's on Park Avenue...

08:27.886 --> 08:30.128
I ran into a woman
with her dog on a leash.

08:30.305 --> 08:32.298
- I ran right into the leash.
- Oh, Judith...!

08:32.474 --> 08:36.139
I didn't hurt the dog,
but the woman was furious.

08:36.311 --> 08:39.846
Confidentially, darling,
this is more than a hangover.

08:40.024 --> 08:42.230
If you don't tell Parsons
these things, I will.

08:42.400 --> 08:43.563
No you won't, Ann.

08:43.736 --> 08:47.105
You're my best and my truest friend,
and you won't tell a soul.

08:47.281 --> 08:49.273
I wouldn't have told you except...

08:49.450 --> 08:53.115
Well, I won't have a dumb animal
blamed for my mistake.

08:53.912 --> 08:55.870
Yes, Elizabeth, what is it?

08:56.290 --> 08:58.995
- Dr. Parsons is here.
- Dr. Par...?

08:59.168 --> 09:02.418
I promised him you'd go to
a specialist about that giddiness.

09:02.588 --> 09:05.873
But I haven't any time for doctors.
Martha, bring my things.

09:06.050 --> 09:07.876
Listen, darling, you may be really ill.

09:08.052 --> 09:10.721
I haven't time to be ill.
It's just some minor nonsense.

09:10.888 --> 09:13.295
Very well.
If you're going up to town, I'm going.

09:13.474 --> 09:16.012
I won't have another tumble
ruin your pretty clothes.

09:16.185 --> 09:18.557
Don't be silly.
I'm perfectly all right alone.

09:18.729 --> 09:22.145
Oh, you're as stubborn as a mule.

09:22.775 --> 09:24.981
- Are we ready?
- She says she's not going.

09:25.152 --> 09:26.432
Thank you, Martha.

09:26.612 --> 09:28.651
Darling, I've got so much to do.

09:28.822 --> 09:31.740
You have the big specialist examine her.

09:33.202 --> 09:34.744
Goodbye, children.

09:48.967 --> 09:50.545
Careful.

09:53.597 --> 09:56.432
No, I'm sorry, Dr. Parsons,
I'm afraid it would be useless.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.008
Dr. Steele has closed
his office, you know.

09:59.186 --> 10:02.021
Permanently. No, he's not coming back.

10:02.189 --> 10:04.478
- You're welcome.
- Sounds good, eh, Wainwright?

10:04.650 --> 10:08.019
- I'm gonna cry in a minute.
- I gotta be out in 45 minutes.

10:08.195 --> 10:10.401
What shall I do
with this case of Dr. Parsons'?

10:10.572 --> 10:13.941
He's worried. He asked me
to hold you here by force if necessary.

10:14.118 --> 10:17.237
You tell Dr. Parsons I waited
nine years to catch this train.

10:17.413 --> 10:20.663
I'm not gonna miss it just because
some nitwit fell off her horse.

10:20.833 --> 10:22.161
Listen to this:

10:22.334 --> 10:25.999
"Miss Judith Traherne, daughter of the
late sportsman and wire manufacturer."

10:26.171 --> 10:30.039
- Imagine putting that in a case history.
- You have Dr. Carter waiting for you.

10:34.388 --> 10:38.599
Say, I'm awfully sorry, doctor. I believe
when I left, you were calling me an idiot.

10:38.767 --> 10:41.009
The boys at the club
were talking about you.

10:41.186 --> 10:42.729
- They won't believe it.
- What?

10:42.896 --> 10:46.182
A man in your position
giving up a practice like this.

10:46.358 --> 10:48.730
Joe, what do you know
about brain surgery?

10:48.902 --> 10:52.271
Well, I think if I had
the surgical courage, I'd be in it.

10:52.448 --> 10:53.942
To go inside a human's skull...

10:54.116 --> 10:57.117
and tinker with the machinery
that makes the whole works go.

10:57.286 --> 10:59.409
- That is romance, isn't it?
- Romance, huh?

10:59.580 --> 11:01.407
There's your romance.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.244
- Florist bill?
- Yes.

11:04.418 --> 11:08.285
Flowers for my last patient.
He was a gifted young composer.

11:08.464 --> 11:11.667
The night before the operation,
he started a new composition.

11:11.842 --> 11:13.122
He didn't finish it.

11:13.302 --> 11:15.591
- Maybe you read about it in the papers.
- Yes.

11:15.763 --> 11:20.804
The operation was a brilliant success.
But the patient just happened to die.

11:21.769 --> 11:24.141
- That's a pretty old joke, Fred.
- Is it?

11:24.355 --> 11:26.561
Look at any brain surgeon's
mortality rate...

11:26.732 --> 11:29.649
you'll find out just how unfunny it is.

11:29.818 --> 11:32.309
Are you quitting because
you've lost your nerve?

11:32.488 --> 11:34.030
What?

11:34.198 --> 11:36.985
- What else can a man think?
- I'm going back to medicine.

11:37.159 --> 11:41.109
- What do you mean, medicine?
- A little laboratory on a farm in Vermont.

11:41.288 --> 11:45.037
Medical Research Bureau is backing me.
Fisher will do the pathology.

11:45.250 --> 11:48.584
Incidentally, the best man
in the country.

11:48.754 --> 11:52.337
How many men would give their eyeteeth
for a practice you're throwing away?

11:52.508 --> 11:54.963
- What is this research, actually?
- Cells.

11:55.135 --> 11:57.543
- Cells?
- Brain cells.

11:57.721 --> 12:01.055
Why do healthy, normal cells go berserk,
grow wild? Do you know?

12:01.225 --> 12:02.719
- No.
- Nobody knows!

12:02.893 --> 12:05.977
But we call them cysts and gliomas
and tumors and cancers.

12:06.146 --> 12:09.480
We hope to cure with the knife
when we don't even know the cause.

12:09.650 --> 12:13.149
Our patients have faith in us
because we're doctors and...

12:13.362 --> 12:16.695
Tell the boys they can split up
my practice. And welcome.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.575
You and Pasteur.

12:19.868 --> 12:23.320
Someday, somebody will discover
a serum that will be to these growths...

12:23.497 --> 12:26.498
what insulin is to diabetes
and antitoxin is to diphtheria.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.074
And maybe earn his title of
Doctor of Medicine.

12:29.253 --> 12:30.581
- Yes?
- Dr. Parsons is here.

12:30.754 --> 12:33.126
- He is?
- He insists.

12:34.008 --> 12:35.965
Well, I suppose I should be polite.

12:36.135 --> 12:37.545
- I must be going.
- Your train.

12:37.720 --> 12:39.178
Yes, I know.

12:41.181 --> 12:45.049
- So long, Fred, old boy. You'll be back.
- Don't hold your breath.

12:46.353 --> 12:48.393
- Good luck, old man.
- Thanks.

12:52.818 --> 12:57.563
- Fred, can't you put this thing off?
- Sorry, doctor, I've closed my office.

12:57.740 --> 13:01.322
- Have you read the case history?
- Oh, you mean this gossip sheet?

13:01.493 --> 13:04.447
- A wire manufacturer's daughter?
- Oh, please, never mind that.

13:04.621 --> 13:06.329
This girl's desperately ill.

13:06.498 --> 13:11.077
I've been watching her like a hawk,
and she's been losing ground each day.

13:11.253 --> 13:14.871
Well, if two minutes
will do you any good, I'll talk.

13:15.049 --> 13:18.797
- What's this about headaches?
- She's been having them persistently.

13:18.969 --> 13:22.421
- Even before the accident, I suspect.
- Before?

13:22.598 --> 13:24.425
She calls them hangovers.

13:26.769 --> 13:28.975
Three weeks? And you wait until now?

13:29.146 --> 13:33.191
You don't know that girl.
She's a very stubborn patient.

13:33.359 --> 13:36.692
Only yesterday she went to a revival
of Cyrano in the afternoon...

13:36.862 --> 13:39.614
and played bridge half the night.
She won't cooperate.

13:39.782 --> 13:42.355
- She won't even tell me anything.
- Won't talk, huh?

13:42.743 --> 13:44.202
Fred.

13:44.370 --> 13:46.943
We're old friends, and I'm desperate.

13:47.122 --> 13:51.369
I brought this little girl into the world.
Took care of her father until he died.

13:51.543 --> 13:54.331
If she's such a great horsewoman,
why was she thrown?

13:54.505 --> 13:56.793
That's it.
It was a queer sort of accident.

13:56.965 --> 13:59.457
She crashed into
the right wing of a jump...

13:59.635 --> 14:02.505
almost as if she'd held her horse
deliberately at it.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.968
I was there. I saw it.

14:05.474 --> 14:08.724
- You're sure it was the right side?
- Yes. Why?

14:09.561 --> 14:12.812
In that case, your best bet
is to get in touch with Findlay.

14:12.981 --> 14:16.481
- Findlay's in Europe.
- All right. Then get Park.

14:16.652 --> 14:18.810
I don't want Park
or any of the rest of them.

14:18.987 --> 14:21.988
Hang it all, they're no better
than I am. I want you.

14:22.157 --> 14:25.941
If I start making exceptions,
I'll be stuck here another nine years.

14:26.120 --> 14:30.912
Fred, you're always talking about
the obligation of doctors to humanity.

14:31.083 --> 14:35.994
- Well, Fred, there is humanity.
- Sorry, doctor.

14:36.422 --> 14:37.702
It can't be done.

14:37.881 --> 14:40.669
- I told you I've closed my office.
- This is ridiculous.

14:40.843 --> 14:43.678
- I'm late already.
- Judy, please.

14:44.054 --> 14:45.881
This is Dr. Steele.

14:47.599 --> 14:50.387
- How do you do? My name's Traherne.
- How do you do?

14:50.561 --> 14:53.811
Judith Traherne, or don't names matter?

14:53.981 --> 14:58.358
To that cold, scientific eye of yours,
we're just guinea pigs, aren't we?

14:58.527 --> 15:02.228
- Glad to have met you. Come on, Ann.
- Where did you get those burns?

15:02.406 --> 15:04.399
What burns?

15:04.575 --> 15:07.576
Your right hand.
Here, between the first two fingers.

15:08.162 --> 15:10.238
I never noticed them before.

15:11.332 --> 15:14.701
I see. Will you come in here
a minute, please?

15:17.546 --> 15:19.539
Come along, Judith.

15:19.715 --> 15:23.084
- You wait.
- Let me have this, will you, doctor?

15:23.260 --> 15:24.589
I'll see Miss Traherne.

15:24.762 --> 15:28.594
- When it's time to go, warn me.
- Certainly, doctor.

15:29.641 --> 15:31.800
Oh, just a moment, doctor.

15:34.146 --> 15:35.973
I haven't much time.

15:36.148 --> 15:38.983
Matter of fact,
I haven't much time myself.

15:41.737 --> 15:43.611
Parsons tells me you're a great hunter.

15:43.781 --> 15:47.613
You could hardly expect me to enter
your office leading a pack of hounds.

15:47.785 --> 15:49.195
Please.

16:00.839 --> 16:03.081
I understand you don't like
to talk about your health.

16:03.258 --> 16:05.381
- That's right.
- Any particular reason why?

16:05.552 --> 16:09.550
- It's just a boring subject, that's all.
- Oh, most people love it.

16:09.723 --> 16:11.431
I make my living by listening.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.886
- Then you're wasting your time.
- I'll send you a bill.

16:15.062 --> 16:17.683
I'm 23 years old, an only child.

16:17.856 --> 16:19.730
I weigh 110 pounds, stripped.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.356
I've had measles, mumps
and whooping cough.

16:22.528 --> 16:24.734
I believe I have
no congenital weaknesses.

16:24.905 --> 16:27.147
- Shall I go on?
- Oh, yes, please.

16:27.366 --> 16:30.450
My father drank himself to death.
My mother lives in Paris.

16:30.619 --> 16:34.783
I take a great deal of exercise.
I'm accustomed to tobacco and alcohol.

16:34.957 --> 16:36.866
I'm said to have a sense of humor.

16:37.042 --> 16:38.620
Is that enough?

16:38.794 --> 16:40.537
All the inconsequential facts.

16:48.595 --> 16:49.876
Thank you.

16:50.055 --> 16:52.380
What are the consequential ones?

16:53.142 --> 16:55.811
- Does that light bother you?
- Not at all.

16:55.978 --> 16:59.513
- Do you use your eyes a great deal?
- I generally keep them open, doctor.

17:02.192 --> 17:03.817
What do you do on Long Island?

17:03.986 --> 17:08.233
Horses, dogs, shooting, yachting,
travel, parties, gossip.

17:08.406 --> 17:11.112
All the pleasures
of the station-wagon crowd.

17:11.285 --> 17:13.776
- You don't think much of that, do you?
- No, not much.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.329
Why not?

17:15.998 --> 17:17.492
It just doesn't appeal to me.

17:17.665 --> 17:19.789
You condemn everything
that doesn't appeal to you?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.868
Oh, by no means.

17:22.046 --> 17:24.963
You asked for my opinion, and I gave it.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.834
Well, anyway, that's my racket.

17:28.010 --> 17:30.382
- What's yours?
- Mine?

17:31.472 --> 17:35.635
Brain surgery, large practice,
about 10 days off every summer.

17:35.809 --> 17:37.090
Sounds awful.

17:37.269 --> 17:38.977
- It is.
- Then why do you do it?

17:39.146 --> 17:41.222
Like yourself,
I've been caught in a racket.

17:41.398 --> 17:45.348
Oh, doctor, what a relief to know
that you're no better than I am.

17:53.744 --> 17:55.024
Thanks.

17:56.830 --> 17:59.665
But you see,
I'm clearing out of my racket.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.787
I'm leaving for Vermont
in about 15 minutes.

18:02.961 --> 18:06.793
You don't mean that narrow, pinched-up
state on the wrong side of Boston?

18:06.965 --> 18:08.460
- That's the one.
- No kidding?

18:08.634 --> 18:11.551
- No kidding.
- What will you do, between yawns?

18:11.720 --> 18:13.760
- You wouldn't be interested.
- Oh, come now.

18:13.931 --> 18:15.674
After leading me on like this...

18:15.849 --> 18:19.053
- Scientific research on cell growth.
- In guinea pigs?

18:19.228 --> 18:21.220
- No, just cells.
- Sounds silly.

18:21.397 --> 18:23.021
So I'm told.

18:23.190 --> 18:27.651
Still, I almost envy you. Must be nice
to believe in what you're doing.

18:27.820 --> 18:30.227
- Don't you?
- Not in the way you do.

18:30.406 --> 18:31.983
Oh, I'm not complaining.

18:32.157 --> 18:34.827
Take it all in all,
they've dealt me a very good hand.

18:34.994 --> 18:37.567
I'm young, I have no particular
responsibilities.

18:37.746 --> 18:40.664
I don't intend to cultivate any either.
One's freer without.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.999
I shall probably marry someday.
No hurry about that.

18:44.169 --> 18:47.704
When I do, I shall build a house
on a ridge I know with a glorious view.

18:47.881 --> 18:51.381
I have my horses. Any luck,
I'll have about 40 years of that.

18:52.094 --> 18:54.799
I think that's a pretty good setup.

19:06.859 --> 19:08.401
That light was bothering you.

19:08.569 --> 19:11.570
- There's nothing wrong with my eyes.
- You were squinting.

19:11.739 --> 19:14.408
- I was not squinting.
- I'm sorry, but you were.

19:14.575 --> 19:16.947
Well, suit yourself. It's your office.

19:28.422 --> 19:30.461
What did you do yesterday?

19:31.008 --> 19:34.922
I played bridge in the afternoon,
I went to the theater in the evening.

19:35.095 --> 19:36.637
Other way around, wasn't it?

19:36.805 --> 19:39.510
- Yes, I guess it was.
- What was the play?

19:42.311 --> 19:45.146
- Cyrano, wasn't it?
- Yes, why?

19:45.314 --> 19:46.773
Did you like it?

19:46.940 --> 19:50.191
- I had such an awful headache, I...
- How long have you had headaches?

19:50.361 --> 19:51.641
Oh, I...

19:51.820 --> 19:54.655
- I don't have them.
- You have one now.

19:54.823 --> 19:56.780
No, I have not.

19:59.370 --> 20:01.362
How did you make out
at bridge yesterday?

20:01.538 --> 20:03.827
- Let me think...
- Quickly!

20:03.999 --> 20:06.953
- I don't remember.
- I know, you lost.

20:07.127 --> 20:09.369
- Yes, I lost.
- How much?

20:10.589 --> 20:12.665
How can I remember?
I play bridge every day.

20:12.841 --> 20:14.633
- Losing a lot lately?
- Yes.

20:14.802 --> 20:16.344
- Playing badly?
- Well, I...

20:16.512 --> 20:19.347
- Forgetting what cards are out?
- Why do you ask stupid questions?

20:19.515 --> 20:20.973
Wait.

20:22.017 --> 20:24.224
Did Dr. Parsons say
you could go out yesterday?

20:24.395 --> 20:28.013
- I'm accustomed to looking after myself.
- But you did disobey his orders.

20:28.190 --> 20:31.310
- What if I did?
- Why pay a doctor, then disregard him?

20:31.485 --> 20:32.944
Someone else called him.

20:33.112 --> 20:36.777
- So you're taking orders from someone?
- I've never taken orders from anyone.

20:36.949 --> 20:38.823
I'll never take orders from anyone.

20:38.993 --> 20:41.993
I'll tell you something else.
I'm well, absolutely well.

20:42.162 --> 20:44.155
I'm young and strong.
Nothing can touch me.

20:44.331 --> 20:47.783
Neither you nor Dr. Parsons can
make an invalid out of me. I'm going.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.240
Wait!

20:51.213 --> 20:53.087
I'm sorry to have wasted your time.

20:53.257 --> 20:55.048
Run away because you're frightened.

20:55.217 --> 20:57.790
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is true.

21:09.606 --> 21:13.022
That's why you held certain things back
from Dr. Parsons.

21:13.193 --> 21:15.435
You were afraid to admit them.

21:18.449 --> 21:21.615
You didn't tell him you've been having
these headaches for months.

21:21.785 --> 21:23.279
But you have.

21:23.454 --> 21:27.072
Lately, they've been getting worse,
until now you're never free of them.

21:27.249 --> 21:29.740
And your eyes,
they've been cutting up too.

21:30.586 --> 21:33.255
Just like somebody shutting
a pair of folding doors...

21:33.422 --> 21:35.995
till your vision is almost cut in half.

21:36.175 --> 21:40.255
You pretended it was your imagination,
but it isn't.

21:40.429 --> 21:43.098
Then that queer, dull feeling
in your right arm.

21:43.265 --> 21:45.839
You can't laugh that off.

21:46.018 --> 21:48.888
I'll tell you how you got those burns
on your fingers.

21:49.063 --> 21:50.557
A cigarette.

21:50.731 --> 21:53.767
You didn't feel the burns because
your nerves are paralyzed.

21:53.942 --> 21:56.943
Your memory is all shot to pieces.
You can't concentrate.

21:57.112 --> 21:59.105
Look at your bridge scores.

21:59.448 --> 22:02.235
And you're irritable
because your nerves are all on edge.

22:03.285 --> 22:08.362
You won't admit it,
but you can't deny it. Can you?

22:12.670 --> 22:15.125
Now I think we'll get somewhere.
Come on.

22:15.506 --> 22:16.964
Come on.

22:23.555 --> 22:25.347
Now just hold my hand with your right.

22:26.684 --> 22:29.009
Now squeeze. Tight.

22:29.186 --> 22:31.262
Come on. Good and tight.

22:31.438 --> 22:33.727
That's it, good. Now the left.

22:34.650 --> 22:36.109
That's right.

22:36.276 --> 22:39.064
Now would you mind removing your coat?

22:39.238 --> 22:41.480
I'm afraid this coat is all there is.

22:43.158 --> 22:45.400
Just sit up here, then, would you?

22:46.328 --> 22:48.617
That's it.
Maybe we can move this sleeve.

22:48.789 --> 22:51.031
- Yes.
- Just a second.

22:54.837 --> 22:56.165
Miss Wainwright.

22:56.338 --> 22:58.497
Nothing in here to bother you.

23:01.510 --> 23:04.048
- Nearly time, doctor.
- I know, I know.

23:04.221 --> 23:06.593
Now, give me your right elbow, please.
Just relax.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.345
Now the left.

23:14.189 --> 23:16.645
Good. Now will you
cross your knees, please?

23:19.820 --> 23:23.734
- That always makes me laugh.
- It is silly, isn't it?

23:25.784 --> 23:28.026
Good. Now the left, please.

23:33.000 --> 23:36.203
Now don't be frightened of this.
It's just an electric light.

23:36.420 --> 23:38.745
You're very kind to your guinea pigs,
aren't you?

23:38.922 --> 23:40.998
Just look straight ahead, please.

23:43.177 --> 23:45.549
I've been told they're a nice color.

23:46.722 --> 23:49.758
- Do you agree?
- Just once again, please.

23:52.353 --> 23:54.475
That they're a nice color?

23:54.980 --> 23:56.724
Oh, yes. Yes, fine.

23:56.899 --> 23:58.607
I'm going to ask you to close them.

23:58.776 --> 24:01.527
Hold your hands out,
palms upwards, please.

24:03.113 --> 24:05.236
Now tell me what this is.

24:05.407 --> 24:07.067
- It's a cube.
- Hard or soft?

24:07.242 --> 24:08.523
- Hard.
- Good.

24:09.953 --> 24:11.697
Now can you tell me what this is.

24:11.872 --> 24:14.743
- I'm not quite sure.
- I see.

24:14.917 --> 24:16.826
Just a minute. Tell me what that is.

24:17.044 --> 24:20.627
Move it around in your hand.
Know what shape it is?

24:20.798 --> 24:22.921
I can't quite make out.

24:23.717 --> 24:26.588
- Can you tell me what this is?
- A pencil, silly.

24:26.762 --> 24:28.042
That's right.

24:28.222 --> 24:30.464
- May I open my eyes now?
- No, no. Not yet.

24:30.933 --> 24:32.213
Here.

24:32.393 --> 24:33.970
Is that cloth rough or smooth?

24:34.144 --> 24:36.351
- It's a piece of silk.
- I see.

24:36.522 --> 24:40.021
I'm going to fool you this time.
What's this?

24:41.151 --> 24:43.821
You can't fool me.
It's still a piece of silk.

24:49.076 --> 24:52.575
- All right. You can open your eyes.
- Am I promoted, teacher?

24:53.288 --> 24:56.040
Now I'm going to ask you
two more questions.

24:56.375 --> 24:58.581
How long since you first noticed
the headaches?

24:59.003 --> 25:00.746
Oh, horrible months ago.

25:00.921 --> 25:02.499
About five or six.

25:02.715 --> 25:07.211
- Your eyes been bothering you that long?
- That's only lately. The last few weeks.

25:07.386 --> 25:08.666
Well, that's a big help.

25:08.846 --> 25:11.134
- Now I...
- If you don't leave immediately...

25:11.306 --> 25:12.931
you'll miss that train.

25:17.938 --> 25:19.349
- Cancel the tickets.
- Doctor...

25:19.523 --> 25:21.599
There are other trains on other days.

25:21.775 --> 25:24.527
- Yes, doctor.
- Thank you.

25:24.903 --> 25:27.359
A few days one way or
the other doesn't matter.

25:27.531 --> 25:30.104
- I'm sorry I'm so difficult.
- You were a good sport.

25:30.284 --> 25:34.531
If I weren't that, doctor, I'm afraid
I wouldn't be much of anything.

25:34.747 --> 25:36.538
Tell me.

25:36.707 --> 25:38.830
What's wrong with me?

25:39.001 --> 25:40.281
Is it my eyes?

25:41.253 --> 25:46.592
I'd be a pretty poor excuse for a doctor
if I told you before I was positive myself.

25:46.759 --> 25:49.843
Anyway, I want you to have
some x-rays taken, lots of them.

25:50.346 --> 25:54.509
Otherwise, you'll lead your normal life,
see your friends, give parties.

25:54.683 --> 25:57.470
Do everything you have been doing,
with one exception.

25:57.644 --> 26:00.930
- What's that?
- You've got to see a good deal of me.

26:02.191 --> 26:04.516
I'll bet you'll be a frost at a party.

26:07.363 --> 26:08.857
Thank you.

26:09.615 --> 26:10.990
Anything else, gentlemen?

26:11.158 --> 26:12.438
No, I think that's all.

26:12.618 --> 26:14.990
- Can we go somewhere and talk?
- Yes.

26:15.162 --> 26:17.451
Go right in here in the sitting room.

26:18.832 --> 26:21.869
- You'll find cigarettes on the table.
- Thank you.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.751
Better put your shoes on.

26:31.387 --> 26:33.960
Hey, you guys be quiet!

26:34.139 --> 26:36.049
There are doctors in the house.

26:36.558 --> 26:39.394
- What have you got?
- I don't know. Maybe it's kittens.

26:40.646 --> 26:45.059
- Well, what's the verdict?
- Dr. Steele will talk to you.

26:46.110 --> 26:48.351
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye, Miss Traherne.

26:48.737 --> 26:51.228
- I'll show the doctors out.
- Then come up, will you?

26:51.407 --> 26:53.483
- All right.
- Goodbye.

27:04.378 --> 27:06.002
Would you like a drink?

27:06.171 --> 27:07.749
No, thanks.

27:08.966 --> 27:10.709
Well?

27:10.884 --> 27:12.592
The prisoner will rise.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.220
The sentence?

27:14.388 --> 27:17.009
We've got to operate.

27:17.182 --> 27:18.974
Operate?

27:19.143 --> 27:20.934
On me?

27:21.770 --> 27:23.514
Where?

27:24.898 --> 27:26.179
No.

27:26.358 --> 27:29.478
Well, after all, the brain's like
any other part of the body.

27:29.653 --> 27:31.812
Things get out of kilter,
have to be adjusted.

27:31.989 --> 27:33.448
Oh, no, I won't.

27:34.408 --> 27:35.986
Ann.

27:36.452 --> 27:37.732
- Ann?
- What's the matter?

27:37.911 --> 27:40.948
Come here. Quickly.

27:41.707 --> 27:43.166
Tell her.

27:43.334 --> 27:45.207
- He wants to operate.
- Operate?

27:45.377 --> 27:48.877
- Yes, on my head.
- Oh, no. You've made a mistake.

27:49.048 --> 27:52.251
I knew almost at once.
I just wanted confirmation, that's all.

27:52.426 --> 27:54.632
- What's she got?
- Yes, what have I got?

27:54.803 --> 27:56.760
Technically, it's called glioma.

27:56.930 --> 27:58.555
- Glioma?
- Oh, don't listen to him.

27:58.724 --> 28:01.891
- It sounds like a kind of a plant.
- Yes.

28:02.061 --> 28:05.015
It is rather like a plant,
a parasitic one.

28:05.189 --> 28:08.474
- If it's taken care of...
- All surgeons are alike, Judy.

28:08.650 --> 28:12.019
Don't be upset, darling.
We can call in other doctors. We wait.

28:12.196 --> 28:13.476
Yes, yes, of course.

28:13.655 --> 28:16.147
But you have to face it sooner or later.

28:17.326 --> 28:19.899
Suppose we just don't
talk about it anymore.

28:34.009 --> 28:36.796
- What?
- Another headache, Miss Judith?

28:36.970 --> 28:39.212
No, not another headache.

28:39.932 --> 28:41.675
Yes, a big headache!

28:41.850 --> 28:44.935
And I'll have
a bottle of champagne for it.

28:57.616 --> 28:59.027
I said no, and I mean no.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.987
Excuse me, please.

29:05.374 --> 29:09.122
She's very nervous. I can't do anything
with her. She wants to see you.

29:09.294 --> 29:11.204
Did she take the medication?

29:11.839 --> 29:13.748
All right, let's get her to sleep.

29:16.176 --> 29:19.213
- It's still not too late to go home.
- May I come in?

29:19.388 --> 29:22.424
- This is your doctor speaking.
- Yes.

29:23.559 --> 29:26.975
- Hello.
- Well, how is everything?

29:27.146 --> 29:28.806
- Everything's awful.
- Is it?

29:28.981 --> 29:32.480
- Look what you make me wear.
- They are pretty dowdy, aren't they?

29:32.651 --> 29:35.486
I suppose you brought some nice things
of your own to wear?

29:35.654 --> 29:38.359
Yes, I did. Some lovely nighties.

29:38.532 --> 29:41.319
In fact, I bought two new ones
especially for...

29:41.493 --> 29:44.411
- For this.
- Miss Dodd, I don't see any reason...

29:44.580 --> 29:48.198
why Miss Traherne shouldn't wear
her own things if she wants to.

29:48.375 --> 29:51.127
Martha, bring that over here.

29:52.755 --> 29:54.794
- See?
- Oh, it's lovely.

29:54.965 --> 29:58.417
- You better turn your back.
- No, I think like this.

29:59.928 --> 30:02.929
See, that's much better.

30:03.098 --> 30:04.806
There. Very pretty.

30:04.975 --> 30:06.256
Oh, thanks.

30:06.435 --> 30:08.641
- Here's a present for you.
- What's that?

30:08.812 --> 30:10.604
Something to make you sleep.

30:10.773 --> 30:12.350
Come on.

30:14.860 --> 30:16.271
There.

30:19.531 --> 30:20.907
Thank you.

30:22.951 --> 30:27.032
But I don't want to sleep. Anyway,
how could I in a 2-by-4 like this?

30:27.206 --> 30:30.076
I have a bed big enough for six.
Why, I can't even move.

30:30.250 --> 30:34.295
Now just a moment. Let me show you
something about this bed.

30:34.463 --> 30:36.290
Watch this.

30:36.590 --> 30:39.081
See that? Rest your legs.

30:39.259 --> 30:40.802
Now the back.

30:41.428 --> 30:45.011
There. That's for your back.
Make you feel much more comfortable.

30:45.641 --> 30:48.808
Before you're through here,
you'll wanna take it home with you.

30:49.603 --> 30:51.014
That is much better.

30:52.147 --> 30:54.187
You know, I can't understand about me.

30:54.358 --> 30:57.228
I've never given in a fraction
to anyone before...

30:57.403 --> 31:01.103
and here I am letting you bounce
me up and bounce me down.

31:03.951 --> 31:05.990
Exactly where...?

31:06.161 --> 31:08.119
Where does it happen?

31:08.288 --> 31:11.455
- Here, or...?
- Now, now. That's my worry.

31:14.294 --> 31:16.620
How do you do it? What do you do?

31:16.797 --> 31:18.790
Chatterbox, aren't you?

31:21.010 --> 31:23.216
It is a distasteful subject, isn't it?

31:24.179 --> 31:26.006
Well, I don't care.

31:27.057 --> 31:29.346
I don't care about anything.

31:29.518 --> 31:31.641
This is a nice bed.

31:31.812 --> 31:34.018
It's a nice room too.

31:34.565 --> 31:38.183
Ann, you're miles away over there.
Come here.

31:40.279 --> 31:41.856
I love you, Ann.

31:42.031 --> 31:44.403
I don't know what I'd do without you.

31:44.575 --> 31:46.698
I love you.

31:46.869 --> 31:48.363
Do you two like each other?

31:48.537 --> 31:50.364
- Of course.
- Sure.

31:50.789 --> 31:52.698
Well, I want you to.

31:53.500 --> 31:56.205
Because I love everybody.

31:57.296 --> 32:00.250
- Will they cut off my hair?
- Just a little.

32:00.424 --> 32:05.002
- I don't want my hair cut off.
- It'll grow back.

32:06.764 --> 32:09.634
Of course it will. Silly of me.

32:11.727 --> 32:14.811
- You know something?
- What?

32:14.980 --> 32:17.898
I feel so good.

32:18.067 --> 32:19.893
Nothing to think about.

32:20.402 --> 32:22.359
You're going to sleep now.

32:23.739 --> 32:27.737
That's right.
I must do everything you say.

32:28.744 --> 32:30.867
I put myself in your hands.

32:33.707 --> 32:35.700
They're rather nice hands.

32:35.876 --> 32:38.284
Good, strong hands.

32:39.546 --> 32:42.037
- Doctor?
- Yes?

32:42.549 --> 32:46.049
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes.

32:46.220 --> 32:51.807
When you get inside my head,
see if you can find any sense in it.

33:02.695 --> 33:04.153
Dr. Steele?

33:04.321 --> 33:06.990
Yes, Dr. Steele is all through
in Surgery 7.

33:07.157 --> 33:08.901
- Good morning.
- It's all clear.

33:09.743 --> 33:11.652
How are you, doctor?

33:13.497 --> 33:16.948
- Wednesday afternoon for right now.
- All right, Wednesday afternoon.

33:17.126 --> 33:20.958
Dr. Driscoll, was that
the laboratory's last word?

33:21.130 --> 33:22.790
I'm afraid so.

33:23.090 --> 33:25.628
- There's no hope?
- No.

33:25.801 --> 33:29.135
Those are the pathological findings.
She's bound to get a recurrence.

33:29.596 --> 33:31.304
And that means?

33:32.766 --> 33:34.759
About 10 months.

33:34.935 --> 33:39.264
- Invalidism, I suppose.
- No. I think it's a rare case.

33:39.440 --> 33:43.105
She'd apparently be as well
as any of us. That is, until...

33:43.277 --> 33:46.278
Well, her sight may fail her
near the end.

33:46.447 --> 33:49.448
- Amblyopia.
- Yes.

33:49.616 --> 33:51.823
There'd only be a few hours after that.

33:51.994 --> 33:54.485
And I brought her into the world.

33:54.663 --> 33:57.830
Hang it all, Steele.
Don't stand there saying nothing.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.835
It's a rotten business, doctoring.

34:07.301 --> 34:09.293
What's the matter, Steele?

34:09.469 --> 34:11.012
Glioma.

34:11.638 --> 34:13.346
Malignant?

34:13.891 --> 34:17.473
A girl like that. So alive...

34:17.643 --> 34:19.554
so entitled to live.

34:19.730 --> 34:24.356
Then this thing, this growth,
comes along and puts a period to it.

34:24.777 --> 34:28.110
Makes you almost wish
it happened on the table.

34:32.284 --> 34:34.360
Are you going to tell her?

34:34.536 --> 34:36.529
Do you want her to know?

34:36.914 --> 34:38.574
No.

34:38.748 --> 34:40.742
Then there's your answer.

35:09.154 --> 35:12.155
Watch her temperature.
I'll be back later.

35:15.744 --> 35:18.911
- I brought that little girl into the world.
- Did you?

35:19.081 --> 35:20.741
Doctor?

35:21.583 --> 35:23.243
She'll be all right.

35:23.419 --> 35:26.455
- How long?
- Oh, a few weeks' convalescence.

35:26.630 --> 35:29.168
Will she really be all right,
just as she was before?

35:29.341 --> 35:32.128
I think I can promise
a complete surgical recovery.

35:32.302 --> 35:34.494
You think so? What does that mean?
Will she be well?

35:34.772 --> 35:36.549
Yes.

36:18.430 --> 36:20.868
- Martha, it fits beautifully, doesn't it?
- Yes, ma'am.

36:21.041 --> 36:23.367
Couldn't tell a thing, could you?

36:23.544 --> 36:25.537
Thank you. That's very good.

36:33.104 --> 36:35.925
Behold. A new woman from top to toe.

36:36.098 --> 36:39.265
Don't get up, Alec. New shoes,
new stockings, new dress, new head.

36:39.435 --> 36:42.389
- And a new disposition.
- What was the matter with my old one?

36:42.563 --> 36:44.141
- Like it?
- Oh, it's very nice.

36:44.315 --> 36:46.354
- Good.
- Move your feet.

36:46.525 --> 36:48.185
Alec, behave.

36:48.402 --> 36:50.561
What was wrong with my old disposition?

36:50.738 --> 36:55.400
Never mind, darling. I've always
loved you, despite your faults.

36:56.035 --> 36:59.155
- I gotta get another drink.
- I have to go down too. Come on.

36:59.330 --> 37:02.331
- What's the matter?
- Michael. He's taken to whistling for us.

37:02.500 --> 37:04.492
Whistling for us?

37:04.710 --> 37:06.584
Oh, Ann. It's Challenger.

37:07.088 --> 37:10.124
- Good afternoon, Michael.
- Good afternoon, Miss Judith.

37:10.299 --> 37:12.292
How nice of you to bring him.

37:12.468 --> 37:16.631
- Oh, you have got him in good shape.
- Yes, your little horse is in fine shape.

37:16.806 --> 37:20.638
Turn him around so she can see him.
But he'll still never be a steeplechaser.

37:20.810 --> 37:23.431
We're teaching him to crochet.
He's working on a set of doilies.

37:23.604 --> 37:25.893
You'll take that back
when he wins the National.

37:26.065 --> 37:30.063
- Everyone here is glad you're back.
- Are they? How nice.

37:30.236 --> 37:33.569
Yes, indeed they are.
The boys at the stables, even the horses.

37:33.739 --> 37:36.409
Take your hat off
when I'm talking to a lady.

37:36.617 --> 37:39.452
I'm very glad. Thanks for bringing him.

37:39.620 --> 37:43.452
Anything for you, Miss Judith. Anytime.

37:43.624 --> 37:46.115
All right, take him on.

37:49.672 --> 37:52.423
Doesn't the world smell nice?

37:52.591 --> 37:54.501
I wonder where
our New England friend is.

37:54.677 --> 37:57.631
- Isn't that him coming through the gate?
- Well, come on, then.

37:57.805 --> 38:01.470
Ann, do I look all right?
Think I ought to change my dress again?

38:01.642 --> 38:05.225
Used to be six dresses on the floor,
now it's 12. You used to be mad.

38:05.396 --> 38:08.397
And what that doctor's done for you,
you're madder still.

38:11.485 --> 38:14.059
Don't let's make a fuss over him
and spoil him.

38:14.238 --> 38:17.689
I'm going to be busy with my friends.
I'm not going to seem too anxious.

38:17.867 --> 38:19.610
And don't you be too anxious either.

38:22.621 --> 38:24.780
- Hi.
- Judy!

38:25.458 --> 38:28.162
- Carrie, hello.
- Judy, you've never looked better.

38:28.335 --> 38:29.664
Thank you.

38:29.837 --> 38:32.458
- That hair. How clever.
- Do you like it?

38:32.631 --> 38:35.798
Gwen, when did you get back?
Good to see you.

38:35.968 --> 38:39.633
It's good, honey. Really good.
This house has been a morgue.

38:39.805 --> 38:42.261
- Thank you.
- Frank will sell you those horses.

38:42.433 --> 38:45.766
- Oh, how wonderful.
- I'll talk to you. I'm a businesswoman.

38:45.936 --> 38:47.265
Let's have some champagne.

38:47.438 --> 38:48.980
- Where can he be?
- He'll be here.

38:49.148 --> 38:51.271
I'll have some. He told me I could.
Will you?

38:51.442 --> 38:53.185
- Yes.
- Thank you, Agatha.

38:53.360 --> 38:56.148
- Here's to me. To life.
- May you never be ill again.

38:56.322 --> 38:57.982
Thanks.

38:59.325 --> 39:02.491
- There he is. Have those things come?
- I don't know.

39:02.661 --> 39:04.654
Go see, will you?

39:05.498 --> 39:07.989
- Colonel Mantle, Dr. Steele.
- How do you do?

39:08.167 --> 39:11.168
Speaking generally,
I consider doctors a pack of frauds.

39:11.337 --> 39:14.788
- Tried to tell me port is bad for my gout.
- How do you do, Dr. Steele?

39:14.965 --> 39:17.338
- Hello, Judith. How are you?
- Hello. Come on.

39:17.510 --> 39:19.502
That's my gang. They're here every day.

39:19.678 --> 39:21.338
- Sit down, will you?
- Thanks.

39:21.514 --> 39:24.183
- You're late.
- Yes. I was at the hospital.

39:24.350 --> 39:26.010
Were you?

39:26.185 --> 39:28.178
- Have a drink?
- No, thanks.

39:28.354 --> 39:30.761
I had one. You said I could.

39:31.357 --> 39:35.686
Thank you again for everything.
For my horse, my first day, my drink.

39:35.861 --> 39:38.187
- Been a good girl?
- No.

39:38.364 --> 39:40.487
- I thought not.
- Why?

39:40.658 --> 39:43.327
I knew you wouldn't be.
I knew you couldn't be.

39:43.494 --> 39:47.326
What do you mean, a good girl?
Well, I am. The idea.

39:47.498 --> 39:50.499
Did you drive in for lunch
and come right back home?

39:50.668 --> 39:54.997
- Father, I cannot tell a lie.
- What did you do?

39:55.172 --> 39:58.043
- Bought these shoes.
- Oh, very pretty. Very nice.

39:58.259 --> 39:59.539
What else?

39:59.718 --> 40:01.795
This. Other new frocks
I think you'll like.

40:02.471 --> 40:05.306
Oh, thanks for
the 2 inches off my middle.

40:05.850 --> 40:08.008
And thank you for my life.

40:08.269 --> 40:10.557
What can I do for you?

40:11.689 --> 40:13.516
Oh, just wait.

40:16.694 --> 40:19.019
Why are you so grumpy?

40:19.947 --> 40:22.105
You always say I'm grumpy.

40:22.283 --> 40:26.233
I've been a good girl until today.
I've practically been your slave.

40:26.412 --> 40:28.120
And I am well. Look.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.991
Reflexes, terrific.

40:33.294 --> 40:34.954
Balance, perfect.

40:35.629 --> 40:40.126
And I can walk a straight line.
I can even walk backwards.

40:40.634 --> 40:42.627
Excuse me, will you?

40:43.929 --> 40:45.803
They're here. The man wants to see you.

40:45.973 --> 40:48.464
Good. Now, go and look out
for our doctor.

40:48.642 --> 40:51.643
Kneel on him, club him if necessary,
but make him have a drink.

40:51.812 --> 40:54.137
Get that look off his face somehow.

40:58.611 --> 41:00.319
Penny for your thoughts.

41:00.488 --> 41:03.109
- Oh, hello, Ann. How are you?
- Hello. How are you?

41:03.282 --> 41:06.283
- You look as if you needed a drink.
- No, thanks.

41:06.452 --> 41:09.204
- What do you think of Judith?
- Fine.

41:09.371 --> 41:12.207
You did that.
You should be very proud of yourself.

41:12.374 --> 41:14.118
Yes.

41:16.253 --> 41:20.251
Dr. Steele, when you came down to
Judith's room right after the operation...

41:20.424 --> 41:23.259
you had a certain look on your face.

41:23.427 --> 41:27.425
I put it down at the time to the strain,
the tension of the operation.

41:27.598 --> 41:29.923
I don't understand you.

41:34.021 --> 41:37.022
I saw that look on your face just now.

41:37.441 --> 41:40.276
I'm Irish. I may be psychic and funny.

41:40.444 --> 41:43.778
I'm probably quite wrong,
but is there something?

41:43.948 --> 41:46.617
Something about Judith
that you're holding back?

41:46.784 --> 41:51.327
If there is...
Please, I am her best friend.

41:53.457 --> 41:55.450
Will you come outside, please?

42:06.137 --> 42:08.010
Then there is something.

42:08.264 --> 42:09.674
I can't save her.

42:10.266 --> 42:14.014
- Nothing can. Nothing.
- What?

42:14.520 --> 42:15.800
She's going to die.

42:16.397 --> 42:17.891
No.

42:18.649 --> 42:20.772
No, that isn't true.

42:23.487 --> 42:25.563
You shouldn't have touched her.

42:27.575 --> 42:29.900
I'm not going to argue with you now.

42:30.077 --> 42:32.153
The facts are these...

42:33.080 --> 42:35.654
I'll try to tell you
in simple layman's language.

42:35.833 --> 42:39.665
You mean she's going to have
that pain again?

42:39.837 --> 42:42.079
And that ghastly confusion?

42:43.215 --> 42:44.875
No.

42:45.259 --> 42:47.501
She's not going to suffer anymore.

42:47.803 --> 42:49.630
That's all behind her now.

42:49.805 --> 42:52.806
Yes, but you told her she could ride.

42:53.142 --> 42:55.929
That's the freakish nature
of this thing. She will ride.

42:56.103 --> 42:58.677
She'll seem well and normal,
like everybody else.

43:01.525 --> 43:03.482
How long have you known?

43:03.652 --> 43:05.645
Since the operation.

43:05.821 --> 43:07.730
Why didn't you let her go then?

43:08.741 --> 43:11.742
I haven't jurisdiction
over life and death.

43:16.624 --> 43:18.284
How will it come?

43:18.793 --> 43:21.793
Quietly. Peacefully.

43:24.632 --> 43:27.301
God's last small mercy.

43:33.224 --> 43:35.382
Will she have no warning?

43:35.559 --> 43:37.469
No chance to be ready?

43:38.771 --> 43:41.855
There may be a moment
towards the end when...

43:42.775 --> 43:46.310
When her sight
may not be quite as good as usual.

43:46.779 --> 43:48.937
A dimming of vision.

43:49.323 --> 43:53.985
Then a few hours, perhaps three, four.

43:56.330 --> 43:58.323
How long has she got?

43:58.624 --> 43:59.905
A year?

44:01.836 --> 44:03.828
Six months?

44:04.922 --> 44:07.674
- Four?
- Possibly more.

44:08.843 --> 44:10.800
I don't believe it.

44:11.512 --> 44:13.006
Ann?

44:13.347 --> 44:17.012
- She must never know.
- No. No.

44:21.272 --> 44:23.181
You sneaks, hiding out on me.

44:23.357 --> 44:24.768
What's the idea?

44:25.985 --> 44:29.354
Well, actually, we're talking about
just how much you should do.

44:29.530 --> 44:32.697
I told him you'd had the devil of a day.
He said it didn't matter.

44:33.200 --> 44:35.359
It's been the best day of my life.

44:37.163 --> 44:41.291
- This is for you.
- Oh, Judith, you shouldn't.

44:42.918 --> 44:47.664
- What's in it?
- A little gold and a lot of sentiment.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.500
From a grateful patient.

44:53.137 --> 44:57.051
Look at that man. I thought a surgeon
had to have such steady hands.

44:57.224 --> 44:59.894
- Let me help you.
- Oh, thank you.

45:12.198 --> 45:13.526
Oh, they're very pretty.

45:14.617 --> 45:19.029
I'm so glad you like them. We couldn't
think of anything else, could we, Ann?

45:20.581 --> 45:21.992
Of course, it isn't enough.

45:25.211 --> 45:27.880
I've an idea. This is my birthday.

45:28.506 --> 45:31.709
- What?
- Well, it is really, you know.

45:31.884 --> 45:33.711
My new birthday.

45:34.595 --> 45:38.011
Let's all three of us each year
get together and celebrate, shall we?

45:40.267 --> 45:42.937
- Come on.
- All right.

45:43.187 --> 45:46.104
Let's have some champagne
right now and start.

45:46.273 --> 45:48.646
Come on, everybody,
we're going to have champagne.

45:48.818 --> 45:50.609
- Where have you been, Judy?
- Outside.

45:51.862 --> 45:54.353
Now, I'll wear my green slacks
in the morning...

45:54.532 --> 45:57.105
and my big hat for lunch.
He'll like that.

45:57.284 --> 45:59.111
I've got to look my best.

45:59.286 --> 46:01.860
If ever Judy had to knock them
for a row of pins...

46:02.039 --> 46:05.704
Oh, Agatha. Here are the menus for
the weekend. Martha, come here.

46:05.876 --> 46:07.536
Now, it's up to you. For evening...

46:07.711 --> 46:10.665
Ann, do you think we ought to dress
for dinner tomorrow night?

46:10.840 --> 46:13.461
- Give him a bit of swish?
- Just as you please, darling.

46:13.634 --> 46:17.252
Oh, no, I don't think so.
They'll be tired.

46:17.847 --> 46:22.140
I'm getting to be such a hostess.
This is my first real weekend.

46:22.309 --> 46:25.476
The house just reeks of dignity.
Of course, I'll have the kids in.

46:25.646 --> 46:29.478
I'll always have them.
I don't think he minds them, do you?

46:30.735 --> 46:33.522
- I don't suppose he will.
- What's the matter?

46:33.696 --> 46:37.195
Nothing. I've got to get through
these bills. It's the 10th of the month.

46:38.075 --> 46:41.824
You'll put on your best dignity,
won't you? And help me keep dignified?

46:43.164 --> 46:44.824
Well...

46:45.124 --> 46:48.742
I'm here, and I think
I'm somewhere very nice.

46:49.211 --> 46:50.492
Look at me.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.081
I'm looking at you.

46:57.094 --> 46:59.087
You're in love?

47:00.014 --> 47:01.294
Yes.

47:02.349 --> 47:04.342
I thought so.

47:04.643 --> 47:06.636
What about him?

47:06.812 --> 47:10.976
- Has he given you any encouragement?
- Not a ripple on the water.

47:11.150 --> 47:13.308
He drives me crazy, but...

47:14.361 --> 47:17.031
But when I just think of him, I...

47:17.198 --> 47:20.115
And when I think
if I hadn't fallen off that horse...

47:20.284 --> 47:21.944
It was awful.

47:22.119 --> 47:23.863
But it was wonderful.

47:24.205 --> 47:25.533
Life's a different thing.

47:25.706 --> 47:28.411
For the first time,
I wake up with something to live for.

47:28.584 --> 47:30.577
Something besides horses
and hats and food.

47:30.753 --> 47:32.081
He's very fine, isn't he?

47:32.254 --> 47:34.745
Very worthwhile, isn't he?

47:34.924 --> 47:38.174
Oh, if only the Spaniards or the French
had settled New England...

47:38.344 --> 47:40.253
instead of the Pilgrims.

47:40.429 --> 47:44.723
Yes, but if he hasn't given you
any signs, how do you know?

47:45.851 --> 47:47.345
Well...

47:47.520 --> 47:49.678
that's it, I don't know.

47:50.272 --> 47:51.932
But he didn't go away.

47:52.108 --> 47:54.184
That's one sign, Mr. Watson.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.020
Must mean something.

47:56.904 --> 47:59.146
Don't be against me.

48:01.992 --> 48:03.985
I'm not against you.

48:05.079 --> 48:06.739
Good.

48:09.208 --> 48:10.868
Ann?

48:11.836 --> 48:14.505
- Will you do something for me?
- Of course.

48:14.672 --> 48:19.250
I was thinking, you might take advantage
of any lull in the conversation tomorrow...

48:19.427 --> 48:21.918
just to mention what a good wife
Judith would be.

48:22.096 --> 48:24.088
What an ideal wife.

48:24.598 --> 48:28.014
- Well, don't you think I would be?
- Oh, the best.

48:28.185 --> 48:31.020
Well, keep both fingers crossed for me.

48:31.439 --> 48:34.108
Ann, one day it'll happen to you.

48:34.275 --> 48:36.600
And you'll know how wonderful it is.

48:37.778 --> 48:39.438
Martha?

48:39.613 --> 48:41.156
Martha?

48:49.415 --> 48:52.416
Murray Hill 7-7340.

48:54.378 --> 48:57.296
May I have Miss Judith's
telephone book, please?

48:58.048 --> 49:01.049
Is that Murray Hill 7-7340?

49:01.218 --> 49:03.792
May I speak to Dr. Steele, please?

49:13.898 --> 49:15.558
What is it?

49:15.941 --> 49:18.267
You and I have got something
to talk about.

49:18.611 --> 49:19.891
Yes?

49:20.321 --> 49:24.021
Does Judith mean anything more to you
than just a patient?

49:37.421 --> 49:39.497
Perhaps it's impertinent of me
to ask you.

49:39.965 --> 49:41.958
No, it isn't.

49:42.134 --> 49:45.052
I think I know.
I think you do care for her.

49:45.221 --> 49:47.842
Yes, Ann. I do care.

49:48.015 --> 49:49.296
So much.

49:49.975 --> 49:51.304
What are you going to do?

49:51.477 --> 49:53.766
Are you going to go up there
and tell her...

49:53.938 --> 49:55.930
and hold her in your arms? Are you?

49:56.107 --> 49:57.933
Or go away and leave her to us?

49:58.317 --> 50:01.022
Which is better? I don't know.

50:01.195 --> 50:04.030
- I haven't slept for two nights.
- Neither have I.

50:04.198 --> 50:05.858
This morning I saw it coming.

50:06.075 --> 50:10.653
And just now, a little while ago, I asked
her to her face, "Do you love him?"

50:10.830 --> 50:14.495
And she answered, "Yes, I do."

50:14.917 --> 50:16.910
It's up to you.

50:17.211 --> 50:18.871
She said that?

50:20.339 --> 50:24.668
You know, Ann, before,
women never meant anything to me.

50:24.844 --> 50:27.335
I'd never met anyone like her.

50:27.513 --> 50:30.430
I was all set.
I had plans, made arrangements.

50:30.599 --> 50:32.177
I know, Vermont.

50:32.351 --> 50:35.435
Why don't you go away for
your own sake and that of your work?

50:35.604 --> 50:37.431
Work.

50:37.982 --> 50:40.651
How can I work when I can't cure her?

50:40.818 --> 50:44.436
Nothing else on my mind. I just sit here.
I can't think of anything else.

50:45.448 --> 50:46.942
Oh, Ann.

50:47.116 --> 50:51.742
- I'd give my body if it'd do any good.
- Isn't there anything? Anything?

50:51.912 --> 50:56.242
What's she ever done this should happen
to her? She's never harmed a soul.

50:56.417 --> 50:58.908
She's never done anything to anyone
except kindness.

50:59.086 --> 51:00.545
I know.

51:00.755 --> 51:02.747
Here, look.

51:02.923 --> 51:05.593
Here's a letter I got today from Vienna.

51:05.760 --> 51:08.085
The last finding in the case.

51:08.262 --> 51:10.255
There's the translation.

51:10.431 --> 51:12.756
Not a chance in the world.

51:13.768 --> 51:16.093
I don't know where to look next.

51:18.105 --> 51:21.308
Here's this Heinzig in Vienna,
the greatest in the world.

51:21.484 --> 51:24.105
Twelve of them. "Prognosis negative."

51:24.278 --> 51:26.105
"Negative."

51:27.615 --> 51:29.442
Negative.

51:31.327 --> 51:33.782
Oh, I'm so sorry for you both.

51:34.413 --> 51:36.987
You couldn't marry her.
You know what she'd expect.

51:37.166 --> 51:41.495
A home, children, plans for the future.
You couldn't do that to her.

51:44.757 --> 51:48.090
The great thing, Ann,
is for her never to know.

51:48.803 --> 51:51.507
Could you stand watching her
growing happier every day...

51:51.680 --> 51:53.673
with this thing creeping up behind her?

51:53.849 --> 51:55.641
Could you stand that? I couldn't.

51:55.810 --> 51:58.976
It isn't a question of what you
or I could stand.

51:59.480 --> 52:02.149
The main thing is for her to be happy...

52:02.316 --> 52:04.309
every hour.

52:16.414 --> 52:20.411
Ann, all my life I've been able
to tell people what to do.

52:20.584 --> 52:23.585
- Now I...
- Telephone, doctor.

52:27.007 --> 52:29.000
This is Dr. Steele.

52:34.598 --> 52:36.674
Are you operating, doctor?

52:36.851 --> 52:38.974
Are you in your office, doctor?

52:39.145 --> 52:42.181
Well, there's a very good friend of yours
waiting for you here.

52:42.356 --> 52:44.598
A very grateful patient.

52:44.775 --> 52:49.437
Well, you'd better hurry. I have
a vague feeling of relapse coming on.

52:49.613 --> 52:51.606
All right, hurry up.

52:51.782 --> 52:53.276
Bye.

52:54.452 --> 52:56.112
Ann?

52:56.829 --> 52:58.987
- Ann?
- She's out, Miss Judith.

52:59.165 --> 53:00.742
Where did she go?

53:00.916 --> 53:03.242
Weren't you telephoning
the doctor's office?

53:03.419 --> 53:07.251
- Yes.
- Well, wasn't Miss Ann there?

53:07.757 --> 53:09.085
What do you mean?

53:09.258 --> 53:12.129
She made an appointment.
Said she was going down there.

53:12.303 --> 53:14.591
- Today?
- Yes. Just a little while ago.

53:14.764 --> 53:16.756
Oh, well, that's funny.

53:47.922 --> 53:49.665
- Hello.
- Hello, Judy.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.510
- Where have you been?
- For a drive.

53:53.260 --> 53:55.087
- Where did you go?
- Town.

53:56.263 --> 53:59.264
- What for?
- Shopping.

53:59.433 --> 54:01.260
What did you buy?

54:02.311 --> 54:03.639
Ann, where did you go?

54:04.814 --> 54:06.640
Judy.

54:07.108 --> 54:09.433
- Good afternoon.
- How do you do?

54:09.610 --> 54:10.938
Oh, hello.

54:11.570 --> 54:15.070
- You did hurry.
- Yes.

54:15.241 --> 54:17.233
How are you, Ann?

54:25.960 --> 54:27.502
Did I stumble into something?

54:29.213 --> 54:30.541
Yes.

54:30.714 --> 54:33.502
We were on the verge
of a jealous scene about you.

54:35.136 --> 54:36.630
What?

54:40.808 --> 54:42.468
Darling.

54:42.810 --> 54:44.637
Poor fool...

54:45.020 --> 54:47.346
don't you know I'm in love with you?

54:58.909 --> 55:01.282
Would you like some tea or a drink?

55:01.996 --> 55:03.905
Tea, I think.

55:05.708 --> 55:08.177
- Elizabeth.
- Yes, Miss Judith.

55:08.344 --> 55:11.545
- Bring me some tea, please.
- Yes, miss.

55:14.049 --> 55:15.544
Sorry.

55:16.093 --> 55:19.094
You couldn't have said anything
I wanted to hear more.

55:19.764 --> 55:21.424
Judy, dear.

55:21.599 --> 55:23.924
I love you so much.

55:35.256 --> 55:37.803
These books go to the medical library,
New York City.

55:37.953 --> 55:40.468
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Miss Wainwright.

55:41.513 --> 55:43.801
Hey. Is anybody here?

55:43.973 --> 55:46.810
- How do you do, Miss Traherne?
- Hello, Wainwright, how are you?

55:46.985 --> 55:50.269
- Fine. The doctor isn't here.
- Where is he? We're to have lunch.

55:50.438 --> 55:52.514
He wants you to meet him
at the restaurant.

55:52.690 --> 55:54.766
I haven't had a chance
to congratulate you.

55:54.943 --> 55:56.935
Oh, thank you.

55:57.278 --> 56:01.146
It's a strange world, isn't it? First time
I came here, you were packing...

56:01.324 --> 56:04.574
and it was the end of my life.
Now, you're still packing...

56:04.744 --> 56:06.452
and my life is just beginning.

56:06.621 --> 56:10.120
- Couldn't I help you while I'm waiting?
- No, thanks. We're all finished.

56:10.291 --> 56:12.498
- Almost.
- All set, lady.

56:12.669 --> 56:15.290
- Excuse me, please.
- Certainly.

56:17.549 --> 56:20.122
- Take those boxes out and come back.
- Yes, ma'am.

56:20.301 --> 56:23.753
You know, I darn near broke my neck
to get that doctor of yours.

56:23.930 --> 56:27.050
I'm mad about him.
Of course, it's the screwiest setup.

56:27.225 --> 56:28.553
Vermont and Long Island.

56:28.726 --> 56:31.052
We live in different worlds.

56:31.229 --> 56:35.061
I wonder if Vermont and I will understand
each other. What do you think?

56:35.233 --> 56:37.985
I don't know much about Vermont,
except what he's told me.

56:38.153 --> 56:39.647
He loves it, doesn't he?

56:39.821 --> 56:41.813
Well, then I will too.

56:41.990 --> 56:46.419
You know, Wainwright, I'm going to sell
my house, my apartment and my horses.

56:46.594 --> 56:51.256
All except Challenger. I'll keep him.
He's a champion.

56:51.599 --> 56:54.269
- Am I disturbing you?
- Not at all.

56:54.769 --> 56:57.438
I'm glad he's going to give up
cutting people open.

56:57.605 --> 56:59.397
He's one of the great scientists.

56:59.566 --> 57:01.891
And I'll be Mrs. Pasteur.

57:02.068 --> 57:05.069
We'll be such useful people
in the world.

57:06.030 --> 57:09.316
"To all to whom these present
shall come, greeting be it known...

57:09.534 --> 57:12.701
Frederick Steele as a fellow
of the something-or-other."

57:13.997 --> 57:18.326
I'll tend his house
and mind his books...

57:18.501 --> 57:21.170
and answer his mail and...

57:24.674 --> 57:26.465
"Judith Traherne."

58:42.377 --> 58:44.500
Wainwright?

58:45.964 --> 58:48.455
What does "prognosis" mean?

58:48.633 --> 58:50.791
It means what the future
of a case looks like.

58:53.888 --> 58:56.177
What does "negative" mean?

58:56.349 --> 58:59.184
That's not so good. It means hopeless.

59:15.618 --> 59:19.070
You said the bar. We've been looking
all over this place for you.

59:39.058 --> 59:41.976
- Take away the flowers, will you?
- Yes, ma'am.

59:51.154 --> 59:55.401
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
Had a consultation. Gee, you look lovely.

59:55.575 --> 59:57.069
- Have a drink.
- No, thanks.

59:57.243 --> 01:00:01.111
- You should have one someday.
- I will. Perhaps on our wedding day.

01:00:01.289 --> 01:00:02.997
Our wedding day.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.827
What's the matter?

01:00:06.127 --> 01:00:07.954
Could anything be?

01:00:08.129 --> 01:00:10.620
- How many of those have you had?
- Several.

01:00:10.798 --> 01:00:14.381
- If I'm late, I'm sorry.
- Ann, don't be sorry. About anything.

01:00:14.552 --> 01:00:16.379
Sit down and join us.

01:00:16.554 --> 01:00:21.549
We're playing games. Hide-and-seek.
You can play too. Puss in the Corner.

01:00:22.143 --> 01:00:24.978
- What's she talking about?
- Nothing.

01:00:27.774 --> 01:00:29.054
Would you like me to leave?

01:00:29.442 --> 01:00:31.933
You two dear friends
must have so much to talk over.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:33.904
My dearest friends.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:36.356
Have a cocktail.
I'm going to have another.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:39.024
- Waiter.
- Yes, I'll have a cocktail.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:41.194
You sure you won't have one?

01:00:41.371 --> 01:00:43.031
Two of the same.

01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:47.699
They're fine. They deaden the brain.

01:00:48.878 --> 01:00:50.871
You know about brains.

01:00:53.174 --> 01:00:55.795
They loosen the inhibitions.
Make the tongue waggle.

01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:58.466
Are you sure you're feeling
quite well, darling?

01:00:59.013 --> 01:01:00.922
You should know how well I am.

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.009
Am I well?

01:01:06.688 --> 01:01:09.095
It's a secret.
Or don't you two know about secrets?

01:01:09.274 --> 01:01:11.183
- Judith, will you...?
- Judy, darling.

01:01:11.359 --> 01:01:13.932
Oh, Carrie, dear. What a nice hat.

01:01:14.112 --> 01:01:17.066
- You remember the eminent Dr. Steele.
- Yes, of course.

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.534
Judy says you're frightfully good.
You must look me over sometime. Sit.

01:01:21.703 --> 01:01:25.403
My dear, if you've anything wrong
with you at all, fly to him at once.

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:27.907
Of course.
Will I see you at the Radcliffe Hunt?

01:01:28.084 --> 01:01:31.038
- Of course.
- Judy, you'll be in Vermont.

01:01:31.546 --> 01:01:33.373
Oh, yes, Vermont.

01:01:33.548 --> 01:01:37.546
- I hear it's cold in Vermont.
- In the winter, but it's nice.

01:01:37.719 --> 01:01:43.389
- You must come to Vermont, Carrie.
- I will. Anyway, nice to have seen you.

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:46.049
Goodbye, Ann. Doctor.

01:01:46.227 --> 01:01:49.928
I meant to ask you, doctor.
Will I be a specimen case?

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:52.431
Will I be in the medical journal?

01:01:53.234 --> 01:01:55.559
Shall we order? Waiter.

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.568
Would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:00.697
Why don't you tell me?

01:02:00.867 --> 01:02:03.274
Why didn't you tell me?

01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:05.484
Well, I...

01:02:05.663 --> 01:02:08.913
I think I'll have a large order
of "prognosis negative."

01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:14.416
- What do you mean?
- You know. Prognosis negative.

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:16.628
Do you know what
prognosis negative means?

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:19.418
Explain to her. Or have you?

01:02:20.094 --> 01:02:23.344
Means a few months of pretending
you're well, then blindness, then...

01:02:23.514 --> 01:02:25.507
Wait, Judith. We can't talk in here.

01:02:25.683 --> 01:02:28.933
Oh, yes, we can. It was a question of
humoring the patient.

01:02:29.103 --> 01:02:34.311
Give the poor dear everything she wants.
Time's so short. Marry her if necessary.

01:02:34.484 --> 01:02:39.062
I know why you went to his office that
day. To beg him to marry me out of pity.

01:02:39.239 --> 01:02:42.857
The kind Dr. Steele. You're both so kind.
So long, my friends.

01:02:43.201 --> 01:02:44.944
Judith, you're wrong.

01:02:48.248 --> 01:02:53.289
Let my heart be still
And listen to one song of love

01:02:53.461 --> 01:02:55.917
Let me feel the thrill

01:02:56.089 --> 01:02:59.125
Of quiet we know nothing of

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:04.295
Oh, give me time for tenderness

01:03:04.472 --> 01:03:08.849
To hold your hand
And understand

01:03:09.018 --> 01:03:14.642
Oh, give me time

01:03:18.152 --> 01:03:20.690
It's 4:00, sir. Last drink.

01:03:20.863 --> 01:03:23.983
- Two here, two there. Same thing.
- Yes, sir.

01:03:24.158 --> 01:03:25.950
- It's funny.
- What?

01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:28.737
Time, Alec.

01:03:28.913 --> 01:03:31.583
Did you ever think about time?

01:03:31.749 --> 01:03:33.409
It goes, Alec.

01:03:33.585 --> 01:03:35.661
That's the business of time.

01:03:35.837 --> 01:03:39.336
Tick, tick, tick.

01:03:40.174 --> 01:03:43.259
You can almost hear it go by.

01:03:43.428 --> 01:03:46.263
Before you know it, it's gone.

01:03:46.598 --> 01:03:51.592
- Then where are we, my friend?
- High and dry. That's the last drink.

01:03:53.146 --> 01:03:56.182
- I want to hear that song again.
- What song?

01:03:56.357 --> 01:03:58.646
That song about time.

01:04:00.278 --> 01:04:02.650
Too late again. Orchestra's going home.

01:04:06.826 --> 01:04:08.486
Hi.

01:04:09.662 --> 01:04:12.829
- I wanna hear that song again.
- It's time to go to bed.

01:04:12.999 --> 01:04:18.586
Oh, mustn't go to bed.
Mustn't sleep. It's a waste.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.997
Time doesn't sleep.

01:04:21.341 --> 01:04:23.214
That's a joke.

01:04:24.510 --> 01:04:26.053
Here.

01:04:26.262 --> 01:04:30.390
- Come on, sing, please.
- Thanks. Come on, boys. Fifty.

01:04:30.558 --> 01:04:32.266
"Time for Tenderness," Malcolm.

01:04:35.855 --> 01:04:39.556
I will never ask
For more than you can give

01:04:39.734 --> 01:04:43.399
Yet when you say,
"Be gay today and live"

01:04:43.571 --> 01:04:48.233
My heart answers cautiously
"Today will soon be gone"

01:04:48.409 --> 01:04:51.363
Why rush to meet our destiny?

01:04:51.537 --> 01:04:54.491
Why must we hurry on?

01:04:55.124 --> 01:04:58.410
Oh, give me time for tenderness

01:04:58.586 --> 01:05:02.916
One little hour
From each big day

01:05:03.091 --> 01:05:05.961
Oh, give me time to stop and glance

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:09.967
The golden sunset of a summer day

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:16.593
Let my heart be still
And listen to one song of love

01:05:16.771 --> 01:05:20.603
Let me feel the thrill

01:05:20.775 --> 01:05:24.393
Of quiet we know nothing of

01:05:24.571 --> 01:05:30.241
Oh, give me time for tenderness

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:34.906
To hold your hand
And understand

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:39.909
Oh, give me time

01:05:55.518 --> 01:05:58.389
- Tell Patches I'll meet you at the bar.
- Right.

01:06:06.446 --> 01:06:08.569
- Hello, Judy.
- Nice work, Judy.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.906
Hooray for me.
Give me a light, will you?

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:14.401
Thanks.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.996
Oh, Judy, darling, you were wonderful.

01:06:20.168 --> 01:06:23.667
Drink the bar dry,
but you still retain your seat.

01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:32.336
- Hello, Martha.
- Excuse me, miss.

01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:35.183
- How's the old homestead?
- All right, Miss Judith.

01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:39.846
You know, I don't know how you do it.
It amazes me how you stick on a horse.

01:06:40.021 --> 01:06:41.515
I'm one of your best friends.

01:06:41.689 --> 01:06:44.690
- I don't care what people say about you.
- How nice of you.

01:06:44.859 --> 01:06:48.026
Drink the town dry.
Take all their husbands and sweethearts.

01:06:48.196 --> 01:06:52.525
- I still say it's none of my business, but...
- But I'd agree with you.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:56.200
Well, of course,
if you want to adopt that attitude.

01:06:56.371 --> 01:06:59.656
You can already fill the Yale Bowl
with people who are sore at you.

01:06:59.832 --> 01:07:02.074
One more doesn't matter.

01:07:02.377 --> 01:07:05.959
Martha, I can't possibly
change unless I have a drink.

01:07:12.887 --> 01:07:16.801
- Miss Traherne, could we have you now?
- No, I want another drink.

01:07:16.975 --> 01:07:18.967
- Hello, Judith, darling.
- Oh, Miss Judith.

01:07:19.143 --> 01:07:20.602
- Yes, Michael.
- I'm going now.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:24.221
I've got the horses packed.
It's snowing outside. I want to get back.

01:07:24.399 --> 01:07:25.727
- Good.
- You did very well.

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:27.276
Thank you, Michael.

01:07:27.569 --> 01:07:28.849
- Oh, Miss Judith.
- What?

01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:31.151
I wonder if you'd
care to drive back with me.

01:07:31.322 --> 01:07:34.323
That mare's got bronchitis
and can't possibly last the night.

01:07:34.492 --> 01:07:36.319
- Hello, George. Jessica's Girl?
- Yes.

01:07:36.494 --> 01:07:39.614
Why don't you put her out of her misery.
I'll get there if I can.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.070
- Judith, darling.
- Hello.

01:07:41.249 --> 01:07:43.288
Sit down, please.

01:07:43.459 --> 01:07:45.167
- Hi.
- Hello, Judy.

01:07:45.336 --> 01:07:48.421
- Hello, Judy!
- Here's a tragedy for you.

01:07:48.590 --> 01:07:51.923
Jessica's Girl has bronchitis
and can't possibly last the night.

01:07:52.093 --> 01:07:54.964
Jessica's Girl is a horse.
Poor Jessica's Girl.

01:07:55.138 --> 01:07:56.929
- The usual.
- Here we go again.

01:07:57.098 --> 01:07:58.676
- Judy, darling.
- Yes.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:00.807
Trotty, trotty!

01:08:00.977 --> 01:08:02.305
Fix me up, will you?

01:08:02.562 --> 01:08:03.973
- Where's Ann?
- She blew.

01:08:04.147 --> 01:08:06.638
I guess the way you were riding
gave her the jitters.

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:10.102
- Poor Ann.
- Miss Traherne, please.

01:08:10.278 --> 01:08:12.686
- They want you to come...
- I got you. The cup.

01:08:12.864 --> 01:08:15.533
Yes, the cup.
I'll tell them you're coming.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.452
The cup. The darling cup.

01:08:19.578 --> 01:08:22.746
- Excuse me, kids, I've won a prize.
- Hurry back.

01:08:36.304 --> 01:08:40.254
- If it isn't the extraordinary surgeon.
- I've been trying to see you.

01:08:40.433 --> 01:08:43.767
How's the mortality rate these days?
Having fun with the knives?

01:08:43.937 --> 01:08:45.810
- Drop it.
- Why aren't you in Vermont?

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:50.024
- You know why I'm not. I want to talk.
- When I need a doctor, I'll send for one.

01:08:50.193 --> 01:08:52.979
- I'm not in your care.
- You'll always be in my care.

01:08:53.154 --> 01:08:55.028
Will I? Is that part of your duty?

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:58.401
To hang on till the very end,
to watch with those scientific eyes?

01:08:58.701 --> 01:09:00.196
Drop it!

01:09:00.995 --> 01:09:04.779
I know how you feel. Anything to strike
back at me, but don't do it this way.

01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:07.283
- What do you mean?
- This. There's nothing in it.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:11.161
What do you want me to do? Stay alone
in my room and think how in a few...?

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.339
I want you to find peace.

01:09:13.508 --> 01:09:15.167
We all have to die.

01:09:15.343 --> 01:09:18.296
The tragic difference is
that you know when and we don't.

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:21.044
But the important thing is the same
for all of us.

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:24.178
To live our lives so that we can meet
death whenever it comes.

01:09:24.519 --> 01:09:28.136
- Beautifully and finely.
- "Beautifully and finely."

01:09:28.314 --> 01:09:31.314
- I'll die as I please. Leave me alone.
- You hate me, don't you?

01:09:31.484 --> 01:09:35.529
I hate you so much for so many reasons.
I hate you for not telling me the truth.

01:09:35.697 --> 01:09:39.196
I hate you for letting me hurl myself
at your head. I'm so ashamed.

01:09:40.827 --> 01:09:42.368
I can understand.

01:09:43.371 --> 01:09:45.862
Miss Traherne, please, they're waiting.

01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.207
Let them wait.
They've got plenty of time.

01:09:50.127 --> 01:09:51.787
Oh, all right.

01:09:51.962 --> 01:09:55.830
- Wait, Judy.
- No, no, I have to go in for the cup.

01:09:56.009 --> 01:09:58.048
- Dr. Steele? How do you do?
- Hello, Alec.

01:09:58.219 --> 01:10:01.137
- Could I buy you a drink?
- No, thanks.

01:10:01.306 --> 01:10:04.591
Judy's certainly on this town,
all right.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:07.175
- You're talking about a friend of mine.
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:07.353 --> 01:10:08.847
Yes.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:11.941
- Say...
- Well, what's the matter?

01:10:12.108 --> 01:10:14.564
He made a crack about Judy,
and the gentleman socked him.

01:10:15.653 --> 01:10:19.568
- You think she'll pull through, doc?
- I think so. Respiration's easier.

01:10:19.741 --> 01:10:21.235
Yeah.

01:10:21.409 --> 01:10:23.698
Lucky we got her in time.

01:10:36.174 --> 01:10:38.843
- Is she dead?
- No. It was touch-and-go for a while.

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:41.548
It's more touch than go now.

01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:44.473
I actually said a prayer.
She's game, though.

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.135
Put up a brave fight.

01:10:50.647 --> 01:10:52.556
Oh, you're cold?

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:59.981
I have a fire in the tack room. Would
you like to go in and warm yourself?

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:01.781
Why not?

01:11:04.494 --> 01:11:06.118
Well, thanks, doc.

01:11:06.287 --> 01:11:08.695
- Call me if you need me.
- I will. Good night.

01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:12.040
- Clarence, get yourself some blankets.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:19.968 --> 01:11:22.672
The first cold's always the bitterest.

01:11:28.476 --> 01:11:30.848
The first and the last.

01:11:36.776 --> 01:11:38.235
Talk to me, Michael.

01:11:39.821 --> 01:11:42.941
- What shall I talk about, Miss Judith?
- Anything. Just talk.

01:11:43.116 --> 01:11:47.528
It was a great show. I came to think
you may not be wrong about Challenger.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:50.029
- Did you?
- I was scared, though.

01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:51.487
Was I that bad?

01:11:51.666 --> 01:11:55.082
No, but something about the way
you ride puts my heart in my mouth.

01:11:55.253 --> 01:11:57.542
You mind if I say something
to you, Miss Judith?

01:11:57.714 --> 01:12:00.205
Of course not.
I asked you to talk, didn't I?

01:12:00.383 --> 01:12:03.004
I think you've been going too hard,
night and day.

01:12:03.177 --> 01:12:07.009
You can't do that and keep on with
your jumping horses. It's hard on you.

01:12:07.181 --> 01:12:10.301
I was hoping that maybe,
in the state of mind you were in...

01:12:10.476 --> 01:12:12.019
you wouldn't ride tonight.

01:12:12.186 --> 01:12:15.887
- A silver cup isn't worth it.
- I wanted that cup.

01:12:18.401 --> 01:12:21.770
I had to show the gentry
I've still got what it takes.

01:12:23.239 --> 01:12:25.279
You sure have.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:32.830
I told you to keep on talking, Michael.

01:12:33.917 --> 01:12:36.953
You know, you and I
are kind of alike, Miss Judith.

01:12:37.128 --> 01:12:40.129
Are we? How?

01:12:40.465 --> 01:12:44.083
You've the spirit in you
the same as I have in me.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:48.472
It's the fighting that counts. You've got
to have action in your life same as I do.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.178
We only live once, Miss Judith.

01:12:52.727 --> 01:12:54.720
Just once.

01:12:57.273 --> 01:12:59.562
- Tell me about you, Michael.
- Me?

01:13:00.068 --> 01:13:03.234
Yes, you. As one human to another.

01:13:03.404 --> 01:13:05.527
We've always talked about horses.

01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:08.200
What's there to say?

01:13:09.410 --> 01:13:11.617
Well, do you have a happy life, Michael?

01:13:13.539 --> 01:13:15.947
I guess I was born out of my time,
Miss Judith.

01:13:16.125 --> 01:13:19.162
I should've lived in the days
when it counted to be a man.

01:13:19.337 --> 01:13:22.006
The way I like to ride
and the way I like to fight.

01:13:22.173 --> 01:13:25.589
What good's riding and fighting
these days? What do they get you?

01:13:51.411 --> 01:13:53.653
What are you trying to do, burn us up?

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.739
Are you afraid to burn, Michael?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.457
Are you afraid to die?

01:14:02.630 --> 01:14:05.548
I wouldn't want to die
while you're alive, Miss Judith.

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:09.834
You're making love to me.

01:14:10.013 --> 01:14:11.341
Aren't you?

01:14:13.516 --> 01:14:16.552
You invited me to talk to you
as a man, didn't you?

01:14:18.897 --> 01:14:20.806
- Yes.
- I'm as good as some of them...

01:14:20.982 --> 01:14:22.560
that's been playing with you.

01:14:22.734 --> 01:14:25.403
They're all afraid of you.
I've heard them talking.

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:29.520
They'd go after you, but they're afraid.
I wish to heaven I was in their boots.

01:14:31.326 --> 01:14:33.449
What then, Michael?

01:14:34.662 --> 01:14:36.869
The nights I've laid awake
thinking of you.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.705
The things I've wanted to say to you
ever since I first laid eyes on you.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:52.674
- You're afraid.
- No.

01:14:53.181 --> 01:14:57.677
- Is it because I'm a stable hand, is it?
- No, Michael, it isn't that.

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:03.564
I just can't go on this way.

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:08.144
First, it's this.

01:15:08.321 --> 01:15:10.479
Then it's something else.

01:15:12.325 --> 01:15:15.160
Michael, I just can't die like this.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.490
Die?

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.994
Yes.

01:15:22.961 --> 01:15:25.796
I'm going to die
in a few months, Michael.

01:15:27.090 --> 01:15:30.459
Oh, heaven forgive you
for saying a thing like that.

01:15:30.635 --> 01:15:32.129
Yes.

01:15:32.887 --> 01:15:34.880
Heaven forgive me.

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.842
When it comes...

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:43.938
it must be met beautifully and finely.

01:15:44.107 --> 01:15:46.016
That's what he said.

01:15:49.779 --> 01:15:52.270
Oh, I'm all shot, Michael.

01:16:16.431 --> 01:16:19.965
Murray Hill 7-7340.

01:16:20.935 --> 01:16:25.063
Ann, you should be asleep.
Poor Ann, you've had so little sleep.

01:16:25.231 --> 01:16:28.647
Where did you go after you left the club?
I've been worried about you.

01:16:30.653 --> 01:16:33.323
To the stables, with Michael.

01:16:33.489 --> 01:16:36.905
- Judith.
- Don't worry, darling, I was saved.

01:16:37.076 --> 01:16:39.994
Of course, for what I was saved
isn't quite clear.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:43.413
Was that Steele you were calling up?

01:16:43.583 --> 01:16:46.584
It doesn't matter. Wasn't any answer.

01:16:46.753 --> 01:16:49.789
This business of apologizing to a man.

01:16:49.964 --> 01:16:51.957
It really doesn't matter.

01:16:53.426 --> 01:16:56.297
Ann, I'm tired.

01:16:56.471 --> 01:16:57.751
So tired.

01:16:59.182 --> 01:17:00.842
Come along.

01:17:01.392 --> 01:17:03.100
Let me put you to bed.

01:17:03.269 --> 01:17:05.178
Why?

01:17:05.355 --> 01:17:06.683
I'll read you to sleep.

01:17:06.856 --> 01:17:08.350
Why? So I can dream?

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:12.024
Oh, Judith, my darling,
please don't talk like that. Please don't.

01:17:12.570 --> 01:17:15.192
Ann, I don't know what to do.

01:17:15.365 --> 01:17:18.734
It's the waiting. Day and night.

01:17:19.494 --> 01:17:22.614
Would I be wrong if I made it happen?

01:17:22.789 --> 01:17:24.366
Now, would I?

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:27.960
Judith, please don't talk like that.

01:17:28.127 --> 01:17:31.413
Don't. Please.

01:17:32.173 --> 01:17:34.545
Don't. Please don't.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:41.339
I see the dawn come up about four days
out of seven in this place.

01:17:41.516 --> 01:17:43.592
Something always seems to happen.

01:17:43.768 --> 01:17:46.769
- Say, can I fix you another drink?
- No, thanks.

01:17:47.397 --> 01:17:50.398
Who can be calling
at this hour in the morning?

01:17:55.488 --> 01:17:56.817
Hello?

01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.188
Judy!

01:17:58.366 --> 01:17:59.777
Yes, he's here.

01:17:59.951 --> 01:18:03.284
Come on up. You know,
push the 10th button in the elevator.

01:18:04.956 --> 01:18:07.162
- Judy?
- Yeah, it's Judy.

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:10.536
I've loved her for a long time,
but I can't help her now, because...

01:18:10.712 --> 01:18:13.000
You're the one man,
so be nice to her, will you?

01:18:13.172 --> 01:18:14.501
All right.

01:18:16.426 --> 01:18:18.549
- Hello, Alec.
- Hello, Judy.

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.673
Hello, doctor.

01:18:21.264 --> 01:18:22.723
Hello, Judy.

01:18:24.309 --> 01:18:26.385
Nice time to come calling, isn't it?

01:18:27.395 --> 01:18:28.889
Come in.

01:18:37.447 --> 01:18:39.653
You know, I searched
half the town for you two.

01:18:39.824 --> 01:18:41.484
I even rang your night bell.

01:18:41.659 --> 01:18:45.906
- I thought doctors were on 24-hour duty.
- Alec kindly asked me to come around...

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.623
and we've been talking.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:50.246
- Did I interrupt something?
- Oh, to the contrary.

01:18:50.418 --> 01:18:53.123
The dawn's well up, and I was gonna
cook eggs and bacon.

01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:54.707
Wouldn't you like some?

01:18:54.881 --> 01:18:58.795
I just thought of it as a way to
get me out. I'm kind of bright that way.

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.088
Glad you dropped in, Judy.
Fix her a drink, doc.

01:19:02.263 --> 01:19:03.888
Shall I make one?

01:19:04.724 --> 01:19:06.633
No, thank you.

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:11.267
You could do something for me, though.

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:14.643
What?

01:19:15.068 --> 01:19:16.610
Forgive me.

01:19:16.778 --> 01:19:18.854
There's nothing to forgive.

01:19:19.948 --> 01:19:21.323
Oh, but...

01:19:24.285 --> 01:19:26.776
The things I said to you.

01:19:29.165 --> 01:19:30.446
Darling...

01:19:30.625 --> 01:19:35.086
it's good to say things.
Gets them off your chest.

01:19:35.255 --> 01:19:36.998
I understood.

01:19:37.173 --> 01:19:38.667
Did you?

01:19:41.469 --> 01:19:44.007
- Do you?
- Yes.

01:19:45.974 --> 01:19:49.140
You said you wanted me to have peace.

01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:51.018
Where is peace?

01:19:51.688 --> 01:19:53.182
Within yourself.

01:19:57.068 --> 01:19:58.859
Judy, come here.

01:20:04.617 --> 01:20:08.033
I tried to do all the things
I said I would.

01:20:08.204 --> 01:20:10.031
Tonight, I...

01:20:11.958 --> 01:20:15.042
Darling, there's been no one but you.

01:20:15.211 --> 01:20:16.871
Darling.

01:20:17.046 --> 01:20:19.418
How good it is to call you that again.

01:20:19.591 --> 01:20:22.508
I had to come and tell you no one.

01:20:22.677 --> 01:20:26.591
See, I couldn't go on with the thought
that you might be bitter toward me.

01:20:26.764 --> 01:20:29.220
I didn't want you
to think of me like that.

01:20:29.392 --> 01:20:31.848
But I love you, Judy.

01:20:32.020 --> 01:20:33.811
I know you do.

01:20:35.023 --> 01:20:38.723
May I take back every rotten thing
I ever said to you?

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:41.523
Oh, darling, help me.

01:20:41.696 --> 01:20:43.689
I've been so stupid.

01:20:43.865 --> 01:20:47.993
I've crammed every minute
so full of waste, and...

01:20:48.161 --> 01:20:50.948
Now there's so little time left...

01:20:51.748 --> 01:20:53.621
and I don't know what to do.

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:56.164
I'm afraid.

01:20:56.336 --> 01:20:59.040
You're so right and strong.

01:21:03.176 --> 01:21:05.667
It's all right now, Judy.

01:21:06.137 --> 01:21:07.679
It's all right.

01:21:09.974 --> 01:21:12.548
May I see you sometimes?

01:21:12.727 --> 01:21:15.728
You're going to see me every day.

01:21:15.897 --> 01:21:18.602
You're coming to Vermont with me.

01:21:18.775 --> 01:21:21.063
- Am I?
- Yes.

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:25.113
Maybe we'll find that peace
there together.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:27.238
No.

01:21:27.408 --> 01:21:30.196
No, that wouldn't be fair to you.

01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:33.954
- We'd have so little...
- Forever, Judy?

01:21:35.124 --> 01:21:36.951
Will you marry me?

01:21:39.254 --> 01:21:40.664
Marry?

01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.633
Oh, wouldn't it be marvelous
if we could?

01:21:45.802 --> 01:21:50.049
Have a real wedding
and be given away and...

01:21:50.223 --> 01:21:52.630
With church bells and champagne...

01:21:52.809 --> 01:21:55.514
and a white frock, orange blossoms...

01:21:55.687 --> 01:21:57.478
and a wedding cake.

01:21:58.690 --> 01:22:01.644
That's one thing I won't have missed.

01:22:01.818 --> 01:22:04.107
And you're giving it to me.

01:22:05.905 --> 01:22:08.443
I can never love you enough.

01:22:09.158 --> 01:22:10.653
Judy.

01:22:23.548 --> 01:22:25.587
Good morning, Elmer. Blowy, isn't it?

01:22:25.758 --> 01:22:27.502
Sure is, Mrs. Steele.

01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:30.927
- How's the sciatica?
- Fine, Mrs. Steele.

01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:56.658
- Martha.
- Yes, Miss Judith?

01:22:56.831 --> 01:22:59.405
- Here's a letter from Miss Ann.
- Is she coming up?

01:22:59.584 --> 01:23:01.208
Not yet, but soon, I think.

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:04.414
"I'm still trying to rent the house,
but no one has any money...

01:23:04.589 --> 01:23:06.795
and I'm not going
to let tramps have it."

01:23:07.717 --> 01:23:10.552
Why do people
complicate their lives so, Martha?

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.843
All those horses and that house.

01:23:13.014 --> 01:23:16.465
Here we have nothing,
and yet we have everything.

01:23:16.684 --> 01:23:18.926
- Haven't we?
- I think you have, Miss Judith.

01:23:19.103 --> 01:23:22.887
A wonder she hasn't come to see you.
You haven't seen her for three months.

01:23:23.066 --> 01:23:25.936
Oh, she'll be up soon.
She wants to finish her work first.

01:23:27.403 --> 01:23:29.111
- What's that?
- The doctor's lunch.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.988
- Hasn't he had it yet?
- No.

01:23:31.157 --> 01:23:33.482
- Why not?
- I knocked on his door twice.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:36.744
When he's busy with his bugs,
he's like a bear with a sore head.

01:23:36.913 --> 01:23:39.451
- I wouldn't disturb him for...
- Well, I'll disturb him.

01:23:39.624 --> 01:23:41.451
Am I afraid?

01:23:43.086 --> 01:23:45.078
Thank you, Martha.

01:24:02.230 --> 01:24:04.685
Hey. Your lunch, doctor.

01:24:04.857 --> 01:24:07.431
- Judy, I've told you...
- You were rude to Martha.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:11.062
I was not rude to Martha. Martha
knows, as you should know, that...

01:24:11.864 --> 01:24:13.608
Well, Henry, the damage is done.

01:24:13.783 --> 01:24:15.526
What damage? Me?

01:24:15.702 --> 01:24:17.990
I've told you never to come in
when I'm working.

01:24:18.162 --> 01:24:20.653
This joint is aseptic.
You're crawling with microbes.

01:24:20.832 --> 01:24:22.112
- Bugs.
- Me?

01:24:22.292 --> 01:24:25.411
- Yes, you.
- That's a fine way to talk to your wife.

01:24:25.712 --> 01:24:28.831
Coming in here with all this food.
We got too many bugs here now.

01:24:29.007 --> 01:24:31.924
And just as I was about to discover
the secret of life.

01:24:33.303 --> 01:24:35.972
Well, maybe not
at this particular moment.

01:24:36.139 --> 01:24:37.799
Oh, but you will.

01:24:37.974 --> 01:24:39.801
And you might have.

01:24:39.976 --> 01:24:41.969
Guess it is my fault.

01:24:43.855 --> 01:24:45.397
Judy, darling.

01:24:45.648 --> 01:24:49.231
- I am sorry.
- There's nothing to be sorry for.

01:24:49.402 --> 01:24:51.478
Your bugs met my bugs
and the food's bugs...

01:24:51.654 --> 01:24:54.406
and they had a party,
and they're gonna get so drunk...

01:24:54.574 --> 01:24:56.234
they won't be any use to anybody.

01:24:56.409 --> 01:24:57.737
- You're mad.
- Yeah. Henry.

01:24:57.911 --> 01:24:59.654
- Yes?
- Get that food out of there.

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:01.489
Prepare for another experiment.

01:25:01.664 --> 01:25:04.499
If at first you don't succeed,
then try, try...

01:25:04.667 --> 01:25:06.956
I'm hungry.
Do you realize it's almost 2:00?

01:25:07.128 --> 01:25:09.833
Don't you touch that.
It's probably got bugs in it.

01:25:10.006 --> 01:25:12.164
If the sandwiches' bugs
got into your bugs...

01:25:12.342 --> 01:25:14.168
your bugs got into the sandwiches'.

01:25:14.344 --> 01:25:16.301
- Just a minute.
- No.

01:25:16.804 --> 01:25:19.509
- All right. All right, toughie.
- It's cold.

01:25:19.682 --> 01:25:21.675
- What's new in the world?
- Guess what.

01:25:21.851 --> 01:25:25.137
I got a letter from Ann.
She's coming to visit us. Read it.

01:25:25.313 --> 01:25:27.389
- What did you do this morning?
- Big things.

01:25:27.565 --> 01:25:29.807
- What?
- I walked.

01:25:33.363 --> 01:25:35.651
Here. Can't have that,
it's got bugs in it.

01:25:35.823 --> 01:25:38.030
- Where did you walk?
- To the village.

01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:39.695
May we use your table, Martha?

01:25:39.869 --> 01:25:41.743
- Why, of course, Miss Judith.
- Sit down.

01:25:41.913 --> 01:25:45.033
- What's new in the village?
- There's a well-founded rumor...

01:25:45.208 --> 01:25:47.284
that it'll be twins for Mrs. Dibble.

01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:51.209
This is great. We'll show her
the great village of Brattleboro.

01:25:51.381 --> 01:25:55.509
The shopping district, the city hall, and
we'll take her to the dance on Saturday.

01:25:55.677 --> 01:25:58.049
Now what? Come here.

01:25:58.221 --> 01:25:59.881
What did you do?

01:26:15.989 --> 01:26:18.065
Here you go, Daffy. Thank you, Ellen.

01:26:18.241 --> 01:26:20.032
- Here we are.
- Here she is, Martha.

01:26:20.201 --> 01:26:23.119
- Hello, Martha. How are you?
- It's good to see you, Miss Ann.

01:26:23.288 --> 01:26:25.576
We're gonna fatten her up
with country gravy.

01:26:25.748 --> 01:26:27.907
- It's perfect.
- Don't you like it?

01:26:28.084 --> 01:26:29.993
- Wanna see my lab?
- Yes, I'd love to.

01:26:31.879 --> 01:26:34.205
Bring the things in, Ellen.
We'll unpack for you.

01:26:34.424 --> 01:26:37.590
Don't take her in. She's got bugs too.

01:26:43.182 --> 01:26:44.558
Oh, this is nice.

01:26:44.726 --> 01:26:47.477
Ann, isn't Judy beyond words?

01:26:47.645 --> 01:26:49.472
- No blue moans at all?
- No.

01:26:49.647 --> 01:26:52.399
We never even think about it.
We don't even talk about it.

01:26:52.567 --> 01:26:54.109
- And you mustn't.
- Of course not.

01:26:54.527 --> 01:26:56.105
Not even with your eyes.

01:26:56.279 --> 01:26:58.852
You'll be tempted to,
but watch yourself.

01:26:59.032 --> 01:27:02.566
You see, we just pretend
that nothing's going to happen.

01:27:03.119 --> 01:27:04.400
Understand?

01:27:04.913 --> 01:27:07.238
Come on, I'll show you
the rest of the place.

01:27:08.583 --> 01:27:10.575
Ann, this is Henry Curtiss. Miss King.

01:27:10.752 --> 01:27:12.032
How do you do?

01:27:12.211 --> 01:27:15.462
- Well, how do you like it?
- It's splendid.

01:27:15.632 --> 01:27:19.961
Well, someday, perhaps in my lifetime
or somebody else's lifetime...

01:27:20.136 --> 01:27:23.303
we'll find a serum that will
put an end to these growths.

01:27:25.558 --> 01:27:27.183
Judy, your thingamabobs have come.

01:27:27.352 --> 01:27:29.344
- My what-abobs?
- Your seeds, your flowers.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.640
- Oh, how wonderful.
- A tongue twister: "Incomparabilis."

01:27:32.857 --> 01:27:34.731
Ladies, what kind of language is that?

01:27:34.901 --> 01:27:37.688
- Incomparabilis.
- Incomparabilis.

01:27:37.862 --> 01:27:40.069
- Be sure you plant them in the sun.
- I will.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:42.279
Here's one for you. Jonquilla Narcissus.

01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:44.941
That's a good one.
I'll name a horse after that one.

01:27:45.119 --> 01:27:47.789
- Go along with you.
- I'm going along. Goodbye, Miss Ann.

01:27:47.956 --> 01:27:50.529
Goodbye, Mr. O'Leary.

01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:53.998
And now to be serious.
About the Grand National.

01:27:54.170 --> 01:27:56.329
I knew there was a reason
why you came up.

01:27:56.506 --> 01:28:00.206
I still think $ 1000 entry fee's
a lot of money to waste on that horse.

01:28:00.385 --> 01:28:02.840
It won't be wasted.
Bet you 6-4 Challenger wins.

01:28:03.012 --> 01:28:04.293
- You got a bet.
- Shake.

01:28:04.472 --> 01:28:06.880
- Have a good time in Philadelphia.
- I'm excited.

01:28:07.058 --> 01:28:09.679
I'll wear all my best clothes,
and we'll go on a tear.

01:28:09.852 --> 01:28:11.560
- You're looking fine.
- Am I? Good.

01:28:11.729 --> 01:28:15.145
Yeah, sure. It makes me believe
in those prayers I've been saying.

01:28:16.359 --> 01:28:17.687
So long, doc.

01:28:17.860 --> 01:28:20.731
Don't call him doc.
That isn't respectful.

01:28:20.905 --> 01:28:23.740
See you at the National. Bye.

01:28:29.414 --> 01:28:31.241
Ann.

01:28:31.416 --> 01:28:33.871
- There's a storm coming.
- What?

01:28:34.043 --> 01:28:37.911
It's getting darker by the minute.
We'll have to take our raincoats with us.

01:28:38.923 --> 01:28:42.791
Suppose it'll rain cats and dogs
and ruin all our nice bulbs.

01:28:42.969 --> 01:28:44.344
Look how it's clouding up.

01:28:44.512 --> 01:28:46.671
It's getting darker every second.

01:28:46.848 --> 01:28:49.765
It's funny, I can still feel
the sun on my hands.

01:29:00.528 --> 01:29:02.106
- Judith.
- Ann!

01:29:02.655 --> 01:29:06.783
The sun has gone. There are clouds.
It is getting dark.

01:29:06.951 --> 01:29:10.285
It's all right. It's all right, Ann.

01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:30.217
Judy. Judith.

01:29:31.392 --> 01:29:34.227
If the Ladies' Gardening Group
can adjourn their meeting...

01:29:34.395 --> 01:29:37.065
I've got some news.
We're not going to Philadelphia.

01:29:37.232 --> 01:29:38.512
We're going to New York.

01:29:38.691 --> 01:29:41.361
I've just read a wire over the telephone.
I'll show you.

01:29:41.527 --> 01:29:42.808
Come on, Judy.

01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:45.858
Come on.

01:29:46.407 --> 01:29:47.985
Not a word.

01:29:51.955 --> 01:29:53.449
Darling, this is great news.

01:29:53.623 --> 01:29:57.288
Read it. A wire from Fisher in
Philadelphia. Martha wrote it down.

01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.954
Well?

01:29:59.128 --> 01:30:00.872
- How nice.
- "How nice"?

01:30:01.047 --> 01:30:02.506
Is that all?

01:30:02.674 --> 01:30:05.378
Ann, you read this.
I never could read Martha's writing.

01:30:05.551 --> 01:30:09.003
Well, Ann,
of all the profound understatements...

01:30:09.180 --> 01:30:12.051
"Doctor Frederick Steele,
Brattleboro, Vermont.

01:30:12.225 --> 01:30:14.632
Wild with excitement
over your latest report.

01:30:14.811 --> 01:30:18.262
Biological tests convince me
you may be on right road with isolation."

01:30:18.439 --> 01:30:20.397
Isolation, see? Choke off the oxygen.

01:30:20.567 --> 01:30:23.318
Well, you two wouldn't understand.
Go ahead, read it.

01:30:23.486 --> 01:30:25.313
- "Believe we..."
- Here, I'll do it.

01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:28.489
"Believe we should present material
in New York tomorrow.

01:30:28.658 --> 01:30:31.149
Please wire.
My congratulations, Fisher."

01:30:31.327 --> 01:30:34.198
- Isn't that marvelous?
- It's wonderful. Isn't it, Ann?

01:30:34.372 --> 01:30:37.159
I was... I was just bowled over
for a minute.

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:40.667
Sure, so was I. I wired Fisher
I'd meet him at 10:00 in the morning.

01:30:40.837 --> 01:30:42.117
- Did you?
- Yeah.

01:30:42.297 --> 01:30:44.835
It means driving to Mill's Junction
to catch the 4:40.

01:30:45.008 --> 01:30:48.092
Martha's packed you,
but I can't even find my socks, so hurry.

01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.549
No.

01:30:53.516 --> 01:30:54.845
Come on.

01:30:58.313 --> 01:31:00.056
What are you going to do?

01:31:01.482 --> 01:31:04.436
I don't know. Nothing.

01:31:04.611 --> 01:31:07.066
- You can't go.
- No.

01:31:07.238 --> 01:31:09.527
- You can't let him go.
- Judy?

01:31:09.699 --> 01:31:12.783
We can't be late, because this board
convenes just twice a year.

01:31:12.952 --> 01:31:16.404
Some of the men are coming from
Boston. Some as far as Kansas City.

01:31:16.623 --> 01:31:20.038
And a very distinguished man,
Heinzig of Vienna is coming.

01:31:20.668 --> 01:31:24.120
They're gonna sit around that table
and tell if your boy's right or not.

01:31:24.297 --> 01:31:26.088
So come on, hurry.

01:31:27.717 --> 01:31:29.045
Oh, Ann.

01:31:29.218 --> 01:31:31.010
Can't you see?

01:31:31.721 --> 01:31:33.963
I can't stop that.

01:31:35.516 --> 01:31:37.889
Can you see anything?

01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:39.685
Can you see me?

01:31:41.022 --> 01:31:43.062
Not very well.

01:31:46.236 --> 01:31:48.312
"Dimming of the vision.

01:31:50.531 --> 01:31:52.738
Then blindness.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.571
Then..."

01:31:57.330 --> 01:32:00.117
Oh, if I can only last till he goes.

01:32:02.835 --> 01:32:04.627
Now, Ann...

01:32:04.796 --> 01:32:06.290
come on.

01:32:06.464 --> 01:32:10.296
Go back to your garden and plant
your flowers as if nothing had happened.

01:32:10.468 --> 01:32:12.425
Dear Ann.

01:32:12.595 --> 01:32:14.837
I know what I must do.

01:32:15.014 --> 01:32:16.556
Go on.

01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:18.976
Go on.

01:32:23.147 --> 01:32:24.523
Judy.

01:32:25.441 --> 01:32:27.149
Coming.

01:32:29.028 --> 01:32:30.938
You know what this means, don't you?

01:32:31.114 --> 01:32:33.984
Means that in five or 10 years,
I'll begin to get someplace.

01:32:34.284 --> 01:32:35.742
It's very exciting, isn't it?

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:38.864
I might even be acclaimed.
Might get our picture in the paper.

01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:42.123
- You'll make history.
- Say, which one are you gonna wear?

01:32:42.292 --> 01:32:43.952
Darling, I don't think I'll go.

01:32:45.712 --> 01:32:49.246
- You haven't packed enough shirts.
- What do you mean, you're not going?

01:32:49.465 --> 01:32:51.873
Ann and I were talking.
I think I'll stay with her.

01:32:52.051 --> 01:32:54.721
New York will do you good.
You can buy new clothes.

01:32:54.887 --> 01:32:57.924
- I don't need new clothes.
- Then you can see your friends.

01:32:58.099 --> 01:32:59.558
Darling, please let me stay.

01:33:04.814 --> 01:33:06.143
All right, then.

01:33:06.316 --> 01:33:08.937
You know, New York would
bore me now. Really it would.

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:12.942
- You see, this is my home here.
- Oh, Judy.

01:33:13.781 --> 01:33:15.441
Why, you're trembling.

01:33:15.617 --> 01:33:17.325
Am I?

01:33:18.745 --> 01:33:21.414
Can't a girl be a little sentimental?

01:33:21.581 --> 01:33:24.119
This is the first time
we've been separated.

01:33:30.214 --> 01:33:32.254
Judy, I'm not going.

01:33:32.884 --> 01:33:35.422
I don't know what I could've been
thinking about.

01:33:36.179 --> 01:33:39.714
- I'll call Fisher and tell him.
- Are you worried about me?

01:33:39.891 --> 01:33:43.141
Yes. Every second
you're out of my sight.

01:33:43.311 --> 01:33:46.514
That's ridiculous.
You needn't be. Ann's here.

01:33:54.781 --> 01:33:56.820
Judy...

01:33:56.991 --> 01:33:59.114
if anything should happen...

01:33:59.702 --> 01:34:03.202
Hush. We mustn't talk about that.
We agreed not to.

01:34:03.373 --> 01:34:06.042
You know I'm not afraid anymore.

01:34:06.209 --> 01:34:07.917
Look, a hole.

01:34:08.086 --> 01:34:12.380
You'd make a fine figure at a board
meeting with your big toe sticking out.

01:34:17.262 --> 01:34:19.883
Oh, darling, come on.

01:34:20.056 --> 01:34:22.464
You know, I used to be afraid.

01:34:22.642 --> 01:34:25.180
I've died a thousand times.

01:34:25.353 --> 01:34:28.804
When death really comes,
it will come as an old friend.

01:34:28.982 --> 01:34:30.891
- Gently and quietly.
- Oh, Judy.

01:34:31.067 --> 01:34:32.478
Oh, we've had so much.

01:34:33.444 --> 01:34:36.611
If we lived to be 100,
we could have no more.

01:34:37.782 --> 01:34:39.822
And I've been so happy.

01:34:41.744 --> 01:34:45.160
- When the time comes...
- When it comes, I'm going with you.

01:34:45.331 --> 01:34:46.956
I will.

01:34:47.125 --> 01:34:49.248
You couldn't be that unkind to me.

01:34:49.419 --> 01:34:51.246
I couldn't live without you.

01:34:53.006 --> 01:34:55.876
You must. You will.

01:34:56.050 --> 01:35:00.759
- You must go on with your work.
- But it's futile and meaningless.

01:35:01.347 --> 01:35:02.972
Cruel.

01:35:03.141 --> 01:35:05.180
Not if you take revenge for it.

01:35:05.351 --> 01:35:06.976
Revenge?

01:35:07.145 --> 01:35:08.722
Yes, revenge.

01:35:08.897 --> 01:35:12.147
By going on with this work
and these experiments.

01:35:12.317 --> 01:35:16.445
By wiping out something...

01:35:16.613 --> 01:35:20.480
that will take me from you one day.

01:35:20.658 --> 01:35:22.865
And with each blow you strike...

01:35:23.036 --> 01:35:27.033
you can say, "That was for Judith,
my wife."

01:35:27.624 --> 01:35:29.166
Come on.

01:35:30.585 --> 01:35:32.624
- Lucy.
- Yes, ma'am?

01:35:33.671 --> 01:35:35.213
Now, no more nonsense.

01:35:35.381 --> 01:35:37.919
You run off to New York
and have your big moment.

01:35:38.092 --> 01:35:40.762
And I'll wait home
as a proper wife should.

01:35:43.306 --> 01:35:45.797
- Darling.
- Yes?

01:35:45.975 --> 01:35:48.264
Tell me something.

01:35:48.686 --> 01:35:51.177
Have I been a good wife?

01:35:51.522 --> 01:35:53.848
Oh, Judy.

01:36:00.365 --> 01:36:02.357
That makes me very happy.

01:36:02.533 --> 01:36:04.859
Happier than anything else.

01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:08.408
I've loved it so, every minute.

01:36:10.041 --> 01:36:12.995
How can I make you understand?

01:36:23.888 --> 01:36:25.715
Look out there.

01:36:31.312 --> 01:36:34.266
Somehow, it's been like that.

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.726
Shining and quiet.

01:36:37.902 --> 01:36:41.567
Yes, Judy. It has.

01:36:42.198 --> 01:36:43.906
Hasn't it?

01:36:45.243 --> 01:36:48.160
Nothing can hurt us now.

01:36:48.329 --> 01:36:51.330
What we have can't be destroyed.

01:36:51.499 --> 01:36:53.575
That's our victory.

01:36:53.751 --> 01:36:56.124
Our victory over the dark.

01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:00.965
It is a victory
because we're not afraid.

01:37:04.929 --> 01:37:07.716
Come on. I'm sorry,
it must be the going away.

01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:09.468
Judy, you're marvelous.

01:37:09.642 --> 01:37:14.981
Remember while you're away,
tie your tie properly and brush your hair.

01:37:17.108 --> 01:37:20.192
- And for heaven's sakes, buy a new hat.
- That's a good hat.

01:37:20.361 --> 01:37:23.113
I can't let you go
looking like a country farmer.

01:37:23.448 --> 01:37:25.939
Come say goodbye to the old boy.
Ann, he's off.

01:37:26.117 --> 01:37:29.201
Thanks, Lucy. Here's a list
of places you can reach me.

01:37:29.370 --> 01:37:31.114
We won't need it. Run along.

01:37:31.289 --> 01:37:34.907
- Drive like mad.
- Take care of everything, won't you?

01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:40.422
- Yes.
- Goodbye, darling.

01:37:43.718 --> 01:37:47.668
- Now, mind yourself in the big city.
- I'll be all right, but it's gonna be lonely.

01:37:48.473 --> 01:37:50.549
Don't tempt me. Get going.

01:37:50.725 --> 01:37:52.219
Bye.

01:37:55.355 --> 01:37:57.181
Hurry home!

01:38:09.953 --> 01:38:11.779
Have you planted the hyacinths yet?

01:38:11.955 --> 01:38:14.955
Yes. No, I don't know.

01:38:15.124 --> 01:38:16.667
Come on.

01:38:19.128 --> 01:38:21.501
I must help you plant them.

01:38:22.465 --> 01:38:24.956
See, they're his favorite flower.

01:38:25.969 --> 01:38:28.507
You'll dig the holes, I'll put them in.

01:38:29.764 --> 01:38:31.922
I want to very much.

01:38:36.187 --> 01:38:37.931
Thank you.

01:38:51.619 --> 01:38:54.953
- You didn't go, Miss Judith.
- No, Martha.

01:38:56.833 --> 01:38:58.576
Come along, Ann.

01:39:01.838 --> 01:39:05.752
You will water my flowers,
won't you, Ann? Take care of them.

01:39:05.925 --> 01:39:10.053
And, Ann, you will take care
of my doctor, won't you?

01:39:10.221 --> 01:39:12.463
He'll need someone. He mustn't be alone.

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:15.641
You see, it's so much worse for him
than it is for me.

01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:19.724
Oh, really, that's true.
I'm the lucky one.

01:39:19.898 --> 01:39:24.109
All I'll miss is growing old
and being tired and worn-out.

01:39:24.694 --> 01:39:26.402
Never leave him, will you?

01:39:26.571 --> 01:39:28.362
I promise.

01:39:29.032 --> 01:39:31.949
Don't. Don't, Ann.

01:39:32.118 --> 01:39:34.158
I'm happy, really I am.

01:39:35.038 --> 01:39:36.781
Now, let me see...

01:39:36.956 --> 01:39:40.871
if there's anything else.
Oh, yes, one more thing.

01:39:41.044 --> 01:39:43.795
When Michael runs Challenger
in the National...

01:39:43.963 --> 01:39:46.419
And he'll win, I'm sure he'll win.

01:39:46.591 --> 01:39:48.251
have a party...

01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:50.801
and invite all our friends.

01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:53.888
Now, let me see. Silly old Alec,
if he's back from Europe.

01:39:54.057 --> 01:39:56.678
Colonel Mantle and old Carrie and...

01:39:56.851 --> 01:40:00.220
Oh, yes, and don't forget
dear old Dr. Parsons.

01:40:00.396 --> 01:40:02.887
Give them champagne and be gay.

01:40:03.066 --> 01:40:05.307
Be very, very gay.

01:40:08.863 --> 01:40:10.144
I must go in now.

01:40:20.250 --> 01:40:23.950
Ann, please understand.
No one must be here. No one.

01:40:24.837 --> 01:40:27.838
See, I must show him I can do it alone.

01:40:28.007 --> 01:40:32.254
Perhaps it will help him over
some bad moments to remember it.

01:40:33.429 --> 01:40:35.636
Ann, be my best friend.

01:40:35.807 --> 01:40:37.598
Go now.

01:40:37.767 --> 01:40:39.760
Please!

01:41:05.837 --> 01:41:07.746
- Martha?
- Miss Judith.

01:41:08.131 --> 01:41:10.170
I'm going up to lie down now.

01:41:11.759 --> 01:41:13.467
Oh, Miss Judith...

01:41:15.388 --> 01:41:16.882
Daffy.

01:41:17.515 --> 01:41:19.306
Daffy, Don.

01:41:19.475 --> 01:41:23.259
Don, come here. Oh, darlings. Darlings.

01:41:23.646 --> 01:41:27.062
Now... Now, go down now. Go on.

01:41:27.233 --> 01:41:28.858
Go, darlings.

01:42:36.386 --> 01:42:40.466
- Is that you, Martha?
- Yes, Miss Judith.

01:42:43.393 --> 01:42:45.848
I don't want to be disturbed.
