06:36.938 --> 06:40.647
I'm first!

06:45.104 --> 06:47.939
♪ This is the way we go to church

06:47.980 --> 06:50.480
♪ Go to church, go to church

06:50.522 --> 06:52.730
♪ This is the way
we go to church... ♪

06:54.605 --> 06:57.272
The party's over.
You men can get movin'.

06:59.564 --> 07:02.981
Hell, I don't know
who you are but...

07:03.023 --> 07:05.605
why be a hog, man?

07:05.647 --> 07:08.148
She can handle four of us.

07:08.190 --> 07:10.648
We also got some mighty fine whiskey.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.024
- Waiting for you!
- Besides...

07:19.356 --> 07:22.107
Now what are you gonna do,
you bastard?

07:22.149 --> 07:28.274
You may get me... but you sure as hell
ain't gonna get any part of her,

07:28.316 --> 07:31.607
unless you like to have your fun
with a corpse!

08:33.111 --> 08:35.486
You keep standing around like that,

08:35.528 --> 08:38.321
the sun's gonna
burn the hell out of you.

08:38.363 --> 08:40.820
They told me they were gonna kill me,

08:40.861 --> 08:43.695
kill me so I couldn't report them.

08:43.736 --> 08:46.238
They told me...

08:51.946 --> 08:54.987
Well, they ain't
telling you much now.

08:55.029 --> 08:57.279
So get dressed.

09:53.117 --> 09:55.407
You're a good man.

09:56.491 --> 10:00.742
All my life I will pray to the Virgin
to protect you from harm.

10:00.783 --> 10:02.242
Jesus Christ.

10:02.283 --> 10:07.325
And I will also pray that for all
your life you have what you desire.

10:07.367 --> 10:10.284
What the hell's
a nun doin' out here?

10:10.326 --> 10:13.451
I'm on a mission.
In Mexico a nun can travel safely

10:13.493 --> 10:15.783
among murderers and thieves.

10:15.825 --> 10:19.284
I could have avoided these men
but I came to ask for food.

10:20.201 --> 10:23.119
- They give you any?
- No.

10:23.160 --> 10:27.451
- There's probably some leftovers.
- I couldn't eat just now.

10:27.493 --> 10:31.077
Well, you look like you could use
a shot of whiskey.

10:31.119 --> 10:33.994
Whiskey? Thank you.

10:36.619 --> 10:38.702
- Your mule?
- Yes.

10:38.744 --> 10:43.536
No provisions, no canteen?
Just how'd you figure on existing?

10:44.911 --> 10:47.827
I was confident
the Lord would provide.

10:47.869 --> 10:50.370
Three more like them?

10:50.411 --> 10:52.828
He also provided you.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.536
- Which way you headed?
- North.

10:59.578 --> 11:01.745
North?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.913
Well, I'm headed south.

11:04.954 --> 11:07.871
So I'll take those ponies
and be on my way.

11:07.913 --> 11:10.496
First we must cover them with stones.

11:10.538 --> 11:15.539
We can't leave without giving them
a Christian burial of some kind.

11:15.580 --> 11:19.704
- After the way they treated you?
- Of course.

11:19.746 --> 11:22.622
You got to be touched in the head.

11:22.664 --> 11:24.955
Do you have a shovel?

11:26.997 --> 11:29.705
Sister, raise your eyes to heaven.

11:31.539 --> 11:35.206
Now, are they or are they not
God's creatures?

11:35.248 --> 11:38.956
- Of course they are.
- Why rob them of this nourishment?

11:38.998 --> 11:41.956
Do you have a shovel?

11:41.998 --> 11:44.081
Yeah, it's on my packhorse.

11:44.123 --> 11:47.956
Would you get it, please, for the
sake of my soul if not your own?

11:49.207 --> 11:53.123
Sister, I don't mind shootin' 'em
but I'm not gonna sweat over 'em.

11:53.165 --> 11:56.791
You're as stubborn as my mule,
you know?

11:56.832 --> 11:58.916
Worse.

12:44.168 --> 12:46.251
How are the blisters?

12:47.169 --> 12:50.085
Other things in life have hurt more.

12:52.877 --> 12:55.085
Thank you, Brother.

12:55.127 --> 12:59.169
- It's Hogan.
- I'm Sister Sara.

13:01.086 --> 13:05.919
Well, Sister Sara,
if you ever get tired of being a nun,

13:05.960 --> 13:08.670
you'll be an A-1 gravedigger.

13:08.711 --> 13:10.795
Have some of these beans.

13:10.836 --> 13:15.088
Those fellas weren't much in a fight
but one of 'em wasn't a bad cook.

13:15.129 --> 13:20.296
I couldn't eat anything they cooked
but I'll have some water, please.

13:20.337 --> 13:23.462
- Help yourself.
- Thank you.

13:56.256 --> 13:59.756
- You really are touched!
- Give that back, please.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.590
Sister, you wanna bless 'em,
bless 'em dry.

14:02.631 --> 14:07.216
I've obliged you 'bout all I'm
going to and now I'll say goodbye.

14:07.257 --> 14:09.923
You stay out of that sun now,
you hear?

14:09.965 --> 14:13.216
Or you're gonna really be in trouble.

14:13.257 --> 14:16.174
Goodbye. Thank you again.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.342
God go with you.

14:38.226 --> 14:41.768
Hey, you're in luck.
Looks like a French cavalry.

14:41.809 --> 14:44.935
You can probably travel
along with them.

14:47.310 --> 14:50.018
Please help me.
They're looking for me.

14:50.059 --> 14:51.644
Why?

14:51.685 --> 14:54.394
I was raising money
for the Mexican army.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.644
I had to escape in the night.

15:01.644 --> 15:06.520
Lady, if you weren't a nun
I'd let you save your own bacon.

15:06.561 --> 15:08.895
All right, do as I say and act fast.

15:08.936 --> 15:11.978
Get rid of that cross,
it shines like a mirror.

15:12.020 --> 15:14.853
You bring that last horse
and follow me.

15:24.896 --> 15:26.979
Son of a bitch.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.312
What are you doing?

15:31.354 --> 15:33.771
I'm doing for you what...

15:33.812 --> 15:37.022
no Holy Virgin's
in any position to do.

15:45.272 --> 15:49.272
We'll walk slowly
so as not to stir up this stream bed

15:49.314 --> 15:51.398
any more than we have to.

15:51.440 --> 15:54.147
Why did you put that dead man
on the horse?

15:54.189 --> 15:58.148
A horse with a rider makes
a deeper print than a horse without.

15:58.190 --> 16:02.480
If we're lucky,
the French will follow those ponies.

16:02.522 --> 16:04.815
Here. Eat this.

16:05.981 --> 16:08.523
I told you to eat something
back there.

16:08.565 --> 16:12.981
Your stomach keeps growling, we'll
have the whole French army on us.

16:13.023 --> 16:18.107
These little noises can't be heard.
Why are you so angry with me?

16:19.191 --> 16:22.983
Well... maybe a nun ought not
be so good-lookin'.

16:23.025 --> 16:25.732
The way I look is of no importance.

16:25.774 --> 16:28.900
I'm married to
our Lord Jesus Christ.

16:28.942 --> 16:33.525
That's what I'm steamed up about,
if you'll pardon my being frank.

16:33.567 --> 16:37.733
- I'm not offended, Brother Hogan.
- Don't "Brother" me.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.817
Excuse me.

17:27.111 --> 17:30.528
They split up, damn it,
and they're catchin' up.

17:36.113 --> 17:38.820
I wouldn't just sit there, move.

17:57.280 --> 17:59.654
We can't outrun 'em.
You can get in there.

17:59.696 --> 18:03.239
I may not shoot all of them
but I'll get their attention.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.655
Wait, then head on out the other way.

18:05.697 --> 18:09.156
You've been a wonderful friend,
Mr Hogan. Go with God.

18:09.198 --> 18:12.072
Leave Him out of this?
Get movin'.

18:22.281 --> 18:25.198
- I can't go in there.
- Why not?

18:25.240 --> 18:27.907
There's a rattlesnake in there.

18:41.492 --> 18:43.657
Keep singin', partner.

18:59.826 --> 19:01.909
Get that mule in here.

19:01.951 --> 19:05.617
Here, if we get split up,
this'll make good eatin'.

21:58.046 --> 22:03.130
Well, well. Too bad nuns don't play
poker, you'd be sharp at it.

22:03.172 --> 22:05.254
There's no way I can thank you.

22:05.296 --> 22:08.046
I suppose you'll
be starting south now.

22:08.088 --> 22:12.380
No, it's gettin' too close to dark.
We'll have a hot meal first.

22:13.464 --> 22:16.089
- Can nuns cook?
- I do.

22:17.172 --> 22:21.756
Good. Your late gentlemen friends
donated us some beans and coffee.

22:21.798 --> 22:25.090
But first I'll scratch up
some firewood.

22:30.798 --> 22:35.466
It's hard to believe that rattlesnake
could taste so delicious.

22:35.507 --> 22:37.590
Here. Ladies first.

22:40.423 --> 22:43.049
Thank you.

22:43.091 --> 22:46.507
So you were headed north.
Any particular place?

22:46.549 --> 22:51.049
I want to try to find a Juarista
band, I'll be safe with them.

22:51.091 --> 22:53.966
- Where were you comin' from?
- Chihuahua.

22:54.007 --> 22:58.799
- Chihuahua? You live there?
- For several years.

22:58.841 --> 23:03.592
- French garrison in Chihuahua.
- Right next to the church.

23:05.967 --> 23:10.592
You wouldn't by any chance know
how many soldiers in the garrison?

23:10.633 --> 23:13.801
- More or less.
- About 200 and some cannon.

23:15.301 --> 23:17.509
How do you know all that?

23:18.883 --> 23:22.051
The French officers
wanted to learn Spanish

23:22.093 --> 23:26.969
so my mother superior assigned
the task to me, I also speak French.

23:27.010 --> 23:30.509
I went into the garrison
three times a week.

23:30.551 --> 23:33.427
I hate them. How I hate them.

23:34.552 --> 23:38.802
- Ain't it a sin for nuns to hate?
- Not if it's something evil.

23:38.844 --> 23:41.885
The French army
killing and torturing Mexicans,

23:41.927 --> 23:45.177
trying to force them
to become one of their colonies.

23:45.219 --> 23:50.469
- How big is the garrison?
- Two storeys. It was a monastery.

23:50.510 --> 23:54.595
- A building with an open patio?
- A beautiful patio...

23:54.636 --> 23:57.970
- A balcony and stairs leading down?
- That's right.

23:58.011 --> 24:02.095
You say it's next to a church.
How far apart are they exactly?

24:02.136 --> 24:06.053
In some places
not more than ten or twelve feet.

24:06.095 --> 24:11.304
From the roof of the church,
is the garrison higher or lower?

24:11.346 --> 24:13.971
Lower. Much lower.

24:14.012 --> 24:17.137
- Sentries?
- Day and night at the front gate.

24:17.179 --> 24:20.555
Sister Sara,
you're gonna slow me up some,

24:20.597 --> 24:25.054
but I'll take you to one of those
guerrilla bands you're lookin' for.

24:25.096 --> 24:29.305
- Do you belong to one of them?
- Till I get paid, yeah.

24:30.180 --> 24:32.723
Paid? You mean in gold?

24:32.765 --> 24:35.597
Well, if they pay me off
in tortillas,

24:35.639 --> 24:38.305
I'm gonna shoot 'em right in the eye.

24:38.347 --> 24:41.681
But the Juaristas are too poor
to hire anybody.

24:43.722 --> 24:48.306
I made a deal to work out
a plan to take the garrison.

24:48.348 --> 24:51.348
If it pays off,
I get half the French treasury.

24:51.390 --> 24:55.223
Then you don't have any sympathy
for their cause?

24:56.306 --> 24:58.932
Not theirs or anybody else's.

25:01.474 --> 25:04.682
See, I spent two years
in a war in the States.

25:04.724 --> 25:07.724
Right now,
all I'm interested in is money.

25:07.766 --> 25:12.517
If money is all you care about,
then why did you fight in that war?

25:13.600 --> 25:17.266
Everybody's got a right
to be a sucker once.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.558
Mr Hogan.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.225
The 14th of July is a French holiday.

25:23.267 --> 25:27.683
By noon of that day last year
the entire French garrison was drunk.

25:29.308 --> 25:31.851
- What's the date today?
- July the 6th.

25:31.893 --> 25:33.976
Beautiful.

25:34.018 --> 25:37.267
That information
puts gold right in my pocket.

25:37.308 --> 25:39.393
This calls for a drink.

25:40.601 --> 25:43.351
Well, I'll be leaving you
for a few moments.

25:43.393 --> 25:47.352
Be careful not to go too far,
there may be another rattler.

25:47.394 --> 25:49.684
I'll pray as I walk.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.102
I'll keep my back turned.
Don't worry.

25:54.144 --> 25:56.852
You're a real gentleman, Mr Hogan.

26:26.437 --> 26:29.604
I guess you haven't slept much
on the ground.

26:29.646 --> 26:31.729
Oh, I'm very tired. I'll sleep.

26:31.771 --> 26:35.188
For somebody who's wore out,
you sure got a happy look.

26:35.229 --> 26:38.814
It was a miracle you found me
when you did, Mr Hogan.

26:38.855 --> 26:43.188
That was no miracle, just an accident
and life is full of 'em.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.605
No. It was a miracle.

26:48.230 --> 26:50.398
Yes, ma'am.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.939
Two men are ridin' along
side by side,

26:52.980 --> 26:57.231
a bullet ricochets off a rock,
kills one of them but not the other...

26:57.273 --> 26:59.356
just an accident, no miracle.

26:59.398 --> 27:01.856
Then you believe
there are no miracles?

27:01.897 --> 27:06.065
Well... Now, you take
that fella this morning.

27:06.106 --> 27:09.023
He could've picked up
that stick of dynamite

27:09.065 --> 27:11.816
and thrown it back at me
before I shot him.

27:11.857 --> 27:14.565
Now, that would have been a miracle.

27:16.982 --> 27:19.649
It's nice to hear you laugh, ma'am.

27:21.816 --> 27:23.982
You think nuns don't laugh?

27:25.857 --> 27:29.608
I don't know. I never
spent the night with one before.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.524
Good night, Mr Hogan.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.900
Thank you again for everything.

27:58.693 --> 28:01.484
Hey, wake up, Sister.

28:01.526 --> 28:04.634
Time to get movin'.

28:06.035 --> 28:09.244
I'm so stiff.

28:09.952 --> 28:13.452
I'm not accustomed
to riding like that.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.577
Would you please help me up?

28:19.953 --> 28:21.411
Thank you.

28:21.453 --> 28:23.786
Oh, my every muscle is aching.

28:24.870 --> 28:28.411
How can I possibly ride again today?

28:28.453 --> 28:31.746
I ride from sunup to sundown.

28:31.788 --> 28:34.036
You either keep up or you don't.

28:35.870 --> 28:39.371
You'll feel better
after a few hours on your mule.

28:42.829 --> 28:44.913
You make very good coffee.

28:44.954 --> 28:48.329
A man on his own
has to take care of himself.

28:49.413 --> 28:51.997
- So you're not married?
- Nope.

28:52.039 --> 28:54.122
- Ever been?
- Nope.

28:55.329 --> 28:58.372
- Want to be?
- Nope.

28:58.414 --> 29:02.122
- Don't you want a woman of your own?
- What for?

29:03.373 --> 29:07.122
Share your name, bear your children,
be a companion?

29:07.164 --> 29:10.748
To ask me to quit drinkin',
quit gamblin', save my money

29:10.790 --> 29:14.331
and to bitch about her
aches and pains? No, thanks.

29:14.373 --> 29:17.581
- Must be a lonely life.
- It's a great life.

29:17.623 --> 29:21.373
Women when I want 'em
and none with the name of Hogan.

29:21.415 --> 29:25.666
How about you, ma'am? Haven't you
ever wanted to be a whole woman?

29:25.707 --> 29:29.082
Have a man make love to you?
Have children?

29:29.124 --> 29:31.332
I've chosen a different way of life.

29:31.374 --> 29:36.749
What about those feelings your god
gave every woman, including you?

29:36.791 --> 29:40.749
- I've always wondered.
- Well, we're human, of course.

29:40.791 --> 29:44.583
When we get those feelings,
we pray until they pass.

29:45.917 --> 29:49.500
In your case,
just how much praying does that take?

29:49.542 --> 29:53.958
What about before you became a nun?
Did you ever have a man?

29:54.000 --> 29:55.751
No.

29:55.793 --> 29:59.083
- Ever been kissed by one?
- No.

29:59.125 --> 30:03.209
Haven't you ever laid awake
wondering what it would be like?

30:03.251 --> 30:04.584
No.

30:04.626 --> 30:08.084
All the women I've ever met
were natural-born liars

30:08.126 --> 30:11.209
but I never knew about nuns till now.

30:11.251 --> 30:13.751
You're right. I lied.

30:14.960 --> 30:17.085
I'll say one thing, Sister.

30:17.127 --> 30:19.626
I sure woulda liked to have
met up with you

30:19.668 --> 30:22.627
before you took to them clothes
and them vows.

30:34.378 --> 30:37.046
That limp's getting worse.

30:42.671 --> 30:44.754
Stone bruised.

30:47.504 --> 30:50.421
It'll take a week
for that to heal up.

30:51.712 --> 30:55.339
Maybe the people in this village
will hide you out

30:55.380 --> 30:57.714
until this animal comes around.

30:57.755 --> 31:01.797
- Why couldn't I ride the packhorse?
- He carries my equipment.

31:01.839 --> 31:04.797
I ain't gonna miss
bein' in Chihuahua on the 14th.

31:04.839 --> 31:08.590
- Please, Brother Hogan...
- I told you not to "Brother" me.

31:10.089 --> 31:15.256
All right, Mr Mule. You were right.
You are as stubborn as my mule.

31:15.298 --> 31:19.465
When we get up to that village,
Sister, then I'll say adiós.

31:19.506 --> 31:22.090
This is where we part company.

31:33.999 --> 31:38.207
- Now what are you doin'?
- I must say a prayer at this shrine.

31:38.249 --> 31:40.749
You said your prayers last night.

31:40.791 --> 31:43.875
It's a sin to pass a shrine
without praying.

31:43.917 --> 31:47.166
- Not if you shut your eyes.
- Please, Mr Hogan.

31:47.207 --> 31:51.083
All right, it's a small shrine,
let's make it a small prayer.

32:28.911 --> 32:32.161
You see, Mr Hogan,
what a little prayer can do?

32:32.203 --> 32:34.536
The Lord provided a kind gentleman

32:34.578 --> 32:37.579
who accepted my mule
for this creature of God.

32:37.621 --> 32:40.411
Now I can still be with you.

32:40.453 --> 32:42.536
Your mule for that burro?

32:43.746 --> 32:46.413
If that kind gentleman
traded you even,

32:46.454 --> 32:49.789
you won't be meeting up with him
in heaven.

34:24.327 --> 34:27.036
This man lives in the hills there.

34:27.078 --> 34:31.370
Three hours ago on his way to the
market he passed a French patrol.

34:31.411 --> 34:33.496
Which way were they headed?

34:36.953 --> 34:41.911
All right. Let's get the supplies
we need and move out.

34:53.621 --> 34:58.496
- I want you up in that tree.
- What tree? Why?

35:00.497 --> 35:04.247
Please, Mr Hogan, looking down
from heights frighten me.

35:04.289 --> 35:05.830
Then look up.

35:05.872 --> 35:10.664
I think there's a mountain lion
around here and I want you up here.

35:10.705 --> 35:13.123
Excuse me, Sister.

35:32.916 --> 35:34.791
What are you doing?

35:34.832 --> 35:38.873
If you can't see him,
you can't shoot him.

35:51.666 --> 35:53.833
How are you doin', Sister?

35:53.875 --> 35:57.625
- Looking up.
- Good.

35:57.667 --> 35:59.792
We won't talk now.

35:59.833 --> 36:03.542
I'd like him to make his run
if he's going to.

36:28.252 --> 36:31.702
What the hell?

36:31.910 --> 36:36.120
Come on, get down from there.
Turn around, I'll catch you.

36:50.679 --> 36:52.763
What about Santa Maria?

36:52.804 --> 36:57.222
French soldiers at Satevo were
waiting for a train for Santa Maria.

36:57.264 --> 37:02.805
Santa Maria's where I'm headed.
Those Juaristas are hiding out there.

37:02.847 --> 37:05.722
Find out why the French
are going there.

37:05.764 --> 37:08.431
All right. You can be sure I will.

37:08.473 --> 37:13.180
All right, Satevo's a long way away,
so let's get some sleep.

37:19.764 --> 37:23.431
By the way, Sister,
I guess I owe you an apology.

37:23.473 --> 37:26.223
When I was trying to get you
up the tree, I...

37:26.265 --> 37:29.432
Oh, no apology is necessary,
Mr Hogan.

37:29.474 --> 37:33.223
In emergencies,
the Church grants dispensation.

37:33.265 --> 37:38.266
It's no sin that you pushed me up
the tree with your hands on my ass.

37:41.641 --> 37:44.474
Where'd you learn
that kind of English?

37:44.516 --> 37:47.266
- What kind?
- Ass.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.392
Oh, in the convent.

37:49.433 --> 37:53.266
Sister Harriet taught us
words for parts of the body.

37:53.307 --> 37:56.058
This part she called the ass.

37:57.225 --> 38:00.433
Where is this Sister Harriet from,
anyway?

38:00.475 --> 38:02.642
New Orleans. Why?

38:04.225 --> 38:08.726
I'd sure as hell like to know
what she did before she became a nun.

40:14.650 --> 40:16.393
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

40:16.534 --> 40:19.951
Please. An officer is dying.
Come with me, please.

40:23.868 --> 40:29.369
Even though you are not a priest, you
can give him some spiritual comfort.

40:31.035 --> 40:33.745
Our colonel is very, very ill.

41:14.289 --> 41:17.871
Deliver his soul
into your soul,

41:17.913 --> 41:20.414
Mary Mother of God...

41:35.081 --> 41:38.289
You filthy bitch!

41:38.330 --> 41:40.373
Kiss the cross. Kiss the cross.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.206
Sister, he was delirious.
Forgive him.

41:43.248 --> 41:48.041
I forgive him.
I forgive him with all my heart.

42:18.967 --> 42:21.050
God damn it!

42:27.218 --> 42:30.051
I don't see how
you can drink this stuff.

42:30.093 --> 42:32.968
You'll get cockeyed drunk!
What happened?

42:33.009 --> 42:36.135
I was recognized,
that's what happened.

42:37.594 --> 42:40.843
- By who?
- I've never been so frightened.

42:40.884 --> 42:42.969
I had visions of being shot.

42:43.010 --> 42:46.177
- Who recognized you? What did he do?
- He died.

42:46.219 --> 42:49.219
What the hell are you talking about?

42:49.260 --> 42:52.719
I was asked to give comfort
to a colonel dying of fever.

42:52.760 --> 42:57.345
He was one of the officers I taught
Spanish at the fort in Chihuahua.

42:57.386 --> 43:00.845
Oh, thank God no one
believed what he called me.

43:00.886 --> 43:03.970
What did he call you?

43:04.011 --> 43:06.095
A filthy Juarista.

43:06.136 --> 43:10.138
All right, he died and you're safe.
Now, what did you find out?

43:10.179 --> 43:13.888
They're waiting for a train
due today for Santa Maria

43:13.929 --> 43:17.429
so they can load it
with supplies and ammunition.

43:20.722 --> 43:22.804
You did all right, Sister.

43:22.846 --> 43:26.471
Between here and Santa Maria
there's got to be a gorge.

43:26.513 --> 43:29.222
Where there's a gorge
there's a trestle.

43:29.264 --> 43:32.554
All we got to do is get there
before the train does.

43:32.596 --> 43:34.097
Will you burn it?

43:34.139 --> 43:37.264
I'll blow it to hell
with the train on it!

43:37.305 --> 43:41.140
Come on, you'll have to ride,
else I'll have to leave you.

43:41.181 --> 43:46.055
- I am not intoxicated.
- That's a hell of a lot of whiskey.

43:46.097 --> 43:49.348
My faith in God
will turn it to water.

43:56.140 --> 44:00.641
We'd better hurry. I've never seen
a train blown to hell before.

44:46.727 --> 44:51.811
- Get out of my line of fire, Sister.
- Can you kill them all with that?

44:53.395 --> 44:55.811
Put it away. These are Yaquis.

44:55.853 --> 45:00.936
They're wild and pagan but
the Church has reached some of them.

45:08.103 --> 45:10.311
Can you get on your horse?

45:11.396 --> 45:13.938
I think so. I think so.

45:15.104 --> 45:17.355
Then tell me when you're on it.

45:36.147 --> 45:39.565
- You must stop that. Are you on?
- I'm on.

one day, so they say

46:24.609 --> 46:28.568

Oh, you got the moss.

- What should I do with it?
- I'll take you through step by step.

46:42.235 --> 46:46.027
First, I got to get drunker
than hell.

46:46.069 --> 46:50.444
- How long since I got hit?
- You asked me that ten minutes ago.

46:50.485 --> 46:54.278
- What was your answer?
- About an hour.

46:55.361 --> 46:59.527
All right. I want you to cut a groove
in the shaft of this arrow

46:59.569 --> 47:03.153
just deep enough
for a good pinch of gunpowder.

47:03.195 --> 47:04.903
Gunpowder?

47:06.403 --> 47:08.528
Gunpowder, that's right.

47:08.570 --> 47:11.820
That'll cauterize the insides,
they tell me.

47:11.861 --> 47:14.404
I don't know if this arrow...

47:14.446 --> 47:17.779
is near my heart
but I don't think so.

47:17.821 --> 47:21.696
Some women have said my heart
ain't exactly...

47:21.738 --> 47:23.821
in the right place.

47:24.946 --> 47:27.114
All right, start cutting

47:27.155 --> 47:31.321
and don't worry
if I yell a little bit.

47:31.363 --> 47:34.822
Come on, my beautiful Sister

well enough I can sing drunk.

48:08.407 --> 48:13.074
- I don't care what you sing.
- You got a beautiful character.

51:03.959 --> 51:06.793
You are a beautiful woman,
Sister Sara.

51:07.876 --> 51:11.710
You feel like a beautiful woman,
you smell like beautiful woman.

51:11.752 --> 51:15.918
- Please, Mr Hogan.
- I can't help thinking,

51:15.959 --> 51:20.127
that first time I saw you
and you were almost naked...

51:20.169 --> 51:23.919
- You must forget that.
- I can't, my beautiful Sister.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.585
I don't want to forget.

51:26.627 --> 51:31.670

each other I think of you that way

51:31.711 --> 51:36.711
and I want to reach out and touch you
and hold you and feel you.

51:36.753 --> 51:40.628
I forgive you because I know
that if you weren't drunk...

51:40.670 --> 51:42.837
Maybe. Maybe so.

51:42.879 --> 51:46.253
But you can't stop
a man from wishing.

51:46.295 --> 51:48.836
I sure wish you weren't a nun.

51:48.878 --> 51:50.962
Please, Mr Hogan.

51:52.379 --> 51:54.504
All right.

51:54.546 --> 51:58.171
Get me some gunpowder
out of my saddle bag.

52:01.796 --> 52:04.464
Don't come near me till I tell you.

52:13.672 --> 52:15.756
Pour some in your hand...

52:17.089 --> 52:19.547
and leave the pouch there.

52:30.256 --> 52:34.215
Fill the groove. Fill the groove.

52:41.549 --> 52:44.424
That's fine.

52:44.466 --> 52:47.216
All right, now comes the hard part.

52:49.799 --> 52:52.007
Cos we gotta time this perfect.

52:53.549 --> 52:56.300
As soon as I light the powder,

52:56.342 --> 53:00.924
you drive the arrow through me
and pull it out the other side.

53:04.592 --> 53:06.550
What do I hit it with?

53:07.968 --> 53:11.717
Take the knife,
put the flat part over the end...

53:15.509 --> 53:17.801

53:20.008 --> 53:22.218
And please, Sister Sara,

53:22.259 --> 53:26.426
please hit it a straight blow,
not a glancing one?

53:31.884 --> 53:34.010
What if I don't hit it straight?

53:35.094 --> 53:39.219
The hell with that,
my beautiful Sister.

53:40.553 --> 53:43.052
The arrow will break off inside me.

53:43.094 --> 53:46.802
Now, I know you're
an A-1 gravedigger but...

53:46.844 --> 53:50.095
All right.
What do I do with the moss?

53:50.136 --> 53:54.428
Plug the holes both sides.

53:54.470 --> 53:57.386
Push it in about a half-inch.

53:57.428 --> 53:59.303
All right.

54:00.388 --> 54:03.470
One last swallow
and it's up to you, Doc.

54:12.721 --> 54:16.762
- Prayin' for me?
- Yes.

54:16.804 --> 54:19.721
Well, then I must be drunk enough.

54:21.305 --> 54:23.779
Damn my eyes...

54:28.097 --> 54:30.180
One last thing, Sister.

54:30.222 --> 54:34.139
The powder will flare up
when I light it, so watch yourself.

54:34.180 --> 54:36.556
Now, you can load up the animals.

54:36.598 --> 54:41.180
We'll be on our way as soon
as you get this stick out of me.

54:53.556 --> 54:55.099
Ready?

55:23.267 --> 55:25.600
Mr Hogan!

55:30.018 --> 55:34.643
Mr Hogan... Mr Hogan, remember
the train with the French supplies.

55:34.684 --> 55:36.976
You have to blow it up.

55:39.518 --> 55:42.477
- How long since I been hit?
- Hours.

55:43.394 --> 55:44.934
What?

55:44.976 --> 55:48.477
- You fell unconscious.
- Why didn't you wake me up?

55:48.519 --> 55:53.060
- I thought you were...
- You thought. The hell you thought.

55:53.102 --> 55:56.769
You let me down, Sister.
You let me down.

55:58.102 --> 56:01.020
Then why don't you get on your horse?

56:01.061 --> 56:03.145
Because...

56:12.311 --> 56:16.478
You're too drunk to ride alone.
I'll have to get on with you.

56:17.561 --> 56:19.645
Hold on to the mane.

56:28.771 --> 56:31.479
Lean back against me. Lean back.

56:33.980 --> 56:36.480
Tell your horse to get moving.

56:36.522 --> 56:40.522
I like being in the arms
of a good-looking nun.

56:41.605 --> 56:43.939
How do you like it, Sister?

56:43.980 --> 56:46.731
The Church allows this
for your safety

56:46.773 --> 56:48.939
but you may not take liberties.

57:03.107 --> 57:07.899
Will you look at
that trestle? Couldn't be sweeter.

57:07.941 --> 57:11.432
- It's a miracle.
- A great place for an accident.

57:11.442 --> 57:14.982
Is this small package of dynamite
powerful enough?

57:15.024 --> 57:17.233
Not if you put it at the base

57:17.275 --> 57:20.650
but if you put it up high
on those braces - pow!

57:25.650 --> 57:29.234
How can you climb that trestle
with your shoulder...?

57:33.443 --> 57:37.318
- Oh, no, Mr Hogan. No.
- Now, wait a minute.

57:37.359 --> 57:41.068
- Remember I saved your life.
- I saved yours today, too.

57:41.109 --> 57:43.485
I saved yours twice from the French.

57:43.527 --> 57:45.735
I saved yours twice - the arrow?

57:45.777 --> 57:49.860
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
desert me in my hour of need?

57:49.902 --> 57:53.277
What about that rattlesnake
when you were hiding?

57:53.319 --> 57:55.528
That was easy, no risk at all.

57:55.570 --> 57:58.777
Did I or did I not come to you
in your hour of need?

57:58.819 --> 58:00.902
This is my hour of need.

58:00.944 --> 58:06.028
What kind of need is your need?
All you have on your mind is money.

58:06.070 --> 58:08.570
What's more important than that?

58:08.611 --> 58:11.986
My life.
If I climb that trestle, I'll fall.

58:12.028 --> 58:16.362
A fine psalm-singing hypocrite
you are.

58:16.404 --> 58:19.986
The French are gonna slaughter
a whole outfit of your Juaristas

58:20.028 --> 58:22.738
and you're the only one
who can help 'em

58:22.779 --> 58:26.113
and you won't climb one lousy,
stinkin' trestle.

58:29.321 --> 58:31.571
That's right, Sister, lean on it.

58:31.613 --> 58:34.697
A little good,
old-fashioned Christian faith

58:34.739 --> 58:37.114
will carry you up there like a bird.

58:37.155 --> 58:41.489
I know you're scared, Sara,
but those braces are easy to climb.

58:41.530 --> 58:46.614
You just keep thinking of all those
Christian lives you'll be saving.

58:46.655 --> 58:50.530
Have faith in that shiny cross
and God and all those saints

58:50.572 --> 58:52.655
will be right up there with you.

58:52.697 --> 58:56.531
You haven't yet told me
how you'll set this off when I...

58:56.573 --> 59:00.366
Let me worry about that. I'll do it
with my rifle. Now get going.

59:01.198 --> 59:03.615
Surely that train's on its way.

59:23.991 --> 59:26.074
Keep goin'.

59:32.367 --> 59:36.492
I want the dynamite up on top
so I can get a clear shot at it.

59:43.076 --> 59:45.700
That's it, Sister.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:55.741
You're entitled,
you certainly are entitled,

01:00:55.782 --> 01:00:59.865
but I never did see anybody
get used to hard liquor so fast.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.657
I want to take a few practice shots
without ammunition.

01:01:03.699 --> 01:01:07.700
You turn around and face the bridge.
Come on, turn around.

01:01:11.157 --> 01:01:13.241
Just like that.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:19.658
Now, when I tell you to,

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:22.908
I want you to take a deep breath
and hold it.

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.658
Come on, grab the end of the barrel.
This ain't easy.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:29.118
Take your fingers off the top of it.

01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:34.493
All right, now take a deep breath.
Hold it.

01:01:37.451 --> 01:01:40.327
- You wouldn't have hit it.
- Yes, I would've.

01:01:40.369 --> 01:01:43.743
- The gun moved when you fired.
- I'd have hit it.

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:46.702
Put out your hand.
Let's see how steady it is.

01:01:46.744 --> 01:01:49.494
You're still drunk,
you'll never hit that.

01:01:49.535 --> 01:01:51.827
- I'll hit it.
- Put a bullet in it.

01:01:51.869 --> 01:01:55.910
Let's see if you can hit
something about the same size.

01:01:55.952 --> 01:02:00.120
That little rock over there,
the one on top of the big rock,

01:02:00.161 --> 01:02:03.119
let's see if you can hit that.

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:05.119
Will you cock this for me?

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.161
Pull down that lever as hard as
you can, then slam it shut.

01:02:11.745 --> 01:02:15.870
Perfect. All right. Yeah.

01:02:18.703 --> 01:02:21.496
Now... take a breath.

01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:30.579
Now cock it again.

01:02:31.954 --> 01:02:35.621
We'd better try it
with you sitting and me kneeling.

01:02:35.662 --> 01:02:37.829
Go ahead. Get down.

01:02:38.914 --> 01:02:41.164
This ain't easy, now.

01:02:42.372 --> 01:02:45.039
All right, take a breath.

01:02:56.664 --> 01:02:58.122
Can you shoot?

01:02:58.164 --> 01:03:01.123
No, and I climbed that thing
for nothing!

01:03:01.165 --> 01:03:04.790
Take it easy, just wait.
I'm sobering up fast.

01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:08.206
Meanwhile,
you fix me a cup of hot coffee.

01:03:15.499 --> 01:03:17.581
I'll fix you some hot coffee!

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:26.542
Sober up! You sober up,
you dirty bastard or I'll kill you!

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:28.666
Sit up!

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:37.167
Now, tell me when to hold my breath.

01:03:37.208 --> 01:03:42.208
Dear Mary, Mother of God, help this
no-good atheist to shoot straight.

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.167
Hold your breath.

01:03:51.501 --> 01:03:53.709
Hold your breath.

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.544
What did I tell you?

01:04:19.503 --> 01:04:24.670
Did I or did I not
hear you call me a bastard?

01:04:24.711 --> 01:04:28.295
Well, I suppose whiskey
can make a man hear anything.

01:04:28.336 --> 01:04:30.754
Dear Lord, forgive him
for the impurity of his thoughts.

01:04:34.628 --> 01:04:38.588
There's the cantina I'm looking for.
I may need your help.

01:04:38.629 --> 01:04:41.921
- Can you go into a saloon?
- In times like this...

01:04:41.962 --> 01:04:44.962
The Church grants dispensations,
I know.

01:05:15.297 --> 01:05:19.090
- Yes, I am speaking English.
- Good. Tequila.

01:05:20.256 --> 01:05:24.216
- Oh. Would you like something?
- Do you have lemonade?

01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:28.048
I'll have lemonade.
You're getting drunk again, are you?

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:31.549
Oh, I never get drunk
unless I'm shot by Yaquis.

01:05:31.591 --> 01:05:35.798
- Then why the tequila?
- Just to oil up my arm. That's all.

01:05:40.091 --> 01:05:43.800
I don't think they've seen a nun
in here for some time.

01:05:43.842 --> 01:05:46.757
Not one like you, that's for sure.

01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:53.758
- Gracias.
- Hey!

01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:57.425
- Any of these men speak English?
- No, señor.

01:05:57.467 --> 01:05:59.717
- You're sure?
- Sure. Me only.

01:05:59.758 --> 01:06:05.759
Good. I'd like to order a bottle
of French champagne, year 1789.

01:06:09.093 --> 01:06:11.301
French champagne, 1789.

01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:14.634
- What is it, señor?
- What's what?

01:06:14.676 --> 01:06:16.760
This "champagne"?

01:06:17.802 --> 01:06:21.885
Is there another
El Gato Negro saloon in this town?

01:06:21.927 --> 01:06:24.802
- Are you the owner of this one?
- No.

01:06:24.844 --> 01:06:28.094
- Well, who is?
- Mi padre. My father.

01:06:28.135 --> 01:06:31.302
When does he get here?

01:06:31.344 --> 01:06:33.427
Por favor, señor.

01:06:35.636 --> 01:06:37.803
That's swell, that's my luck.

01:06:37.845 --> 01:06:41.428
They give me a code
and the man who has it isn't here.

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:44.386
He'll probably show up
on the 15th of July.

01:06:45.595 --> 01:06:49.804
Mr Hogan, you should be happy
you're still alive.

01:06:50.806 --> 01:06:54.890
- Where the hell's your father?
- Señor, he is sick. Enfermo.

01:06:54.931 --> 01:06:57.266
It's important I see him.
Where is he?

01:06:57.307 --> 01:07:00.140
Since three days now,
he cannot talk.

01:07:00.181 --> 01:07:02.391
All this side, no move.

01:07:02.432 --> 01:07:05.266
- Does he understand when you speak?
- Sí, señor.

01:07:05.307 --> 01:07:07.307
Does he understand English?

01:07:07.349 --> 01:07:12.474
Not so good like me but...
my mother, she with him.

01:07:29.226 --> 01:07:31.767
He no can speak.

01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:35.101
May we see him?

01:07:35.143 --> 01:07:37.768
Please to come.

01:07:56.102 --> 01:07:58.435
Francisco.

01:08:03.935 --> 01:08:06.435
Can you understand me, señor?

01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:11.853
That means yes.

01:08:12.935 --> 01:08:16.978
I need a bottle of French champagne,
year 1789.

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:24.228
I must see Colonel Beltran at once.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:27.479
Can you take me to where his camp is?

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.063
What about your son?
Can he take me there?

01:08:35.270 --> 01:08:38.563
Does anybody in this town
know where the camp is?

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:00.731
She says the candle-maker knows.

01:09:07.733 --> 01:09:10.108
Now, we go that way.

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:13.732
- How far, Horacio?
- Not far.

01:09:40.944 --> 01:09:42.984
Put away your gun, gringo.

01:09:49.944 --> 01:09:52.984
Name's Hogan. Beltran's expecting me.

01:09:53.027 --> 01:09:55.860
You mean Colonel Beltran.

01:09:55.902 --> 01:10:00.278
Colonel, general, what difference
does it make? Take me to him.

01:12:03.911 --> 01:12:09.078
I have been waiting for you, Hogan.
What happened to you?

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:11.454
I stopped a Yaquis arrow.

01:12:11.496 --> 01:12:14.703
- So you never got to Chihuahua?
- Nope.

01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:17.871
Sister Sara here saved me
a good part of the trip.

01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:20.913
Sister? How?

01:12:20.954 --> 01:12:24.372
- Is the deal still on?
- I keep to my word. And you?

01:12:24.413 --> 01:12:27.746
Good. You get me a bottle of tequila

01:12:27.788 --> 01:12:31.539
and I'll lay you out a plan
as smooth as a baby's behind.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:35.246
You tell me the plan,
I will tell you how smooth it is.

01:12:37.164 --> 01:12:42.039
The roof of the garrison
is lower than the roof of the church

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.581
and on the 14th of July
you have promised us, Sister,

01:12:45.623 --> 01:12:47.872
all the Frenchmen will be drunk.

01:12:47.914 --> 01:12:52.123
Not bad, Hogan. Not bad.
Thank you, Sister.

01:12:52.165 --> 01:12:54.248
Yeah, we make quite a team.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:58.998
If we pull this off, we might go in
the garrison business again, right?

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:03.291
If we follow what you did to
the train by capturing the garrison,

01:13:03.332 --> 01:13:07.498
- all of my people will take heart.
- How many men do you have?

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.999
40, but there'll be more
by the time we reach Chihuahua.

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:13.957
- How many more?
- 50 to 60.

01:13:13.999 --> 01:13:17.874
- I thought you were an army colonel.
- I am.

01:13:17.916 --> 01:13:22.042
Any army I ever heard about,
a colonel commands a full regiment.

01:13:22.083 --> 01:13:25.417
Not after all the fighting
we've been through.

01:13:26.542 --> 01:13:30.208
When you got me into this,
you said you had no artillery.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:34.042
- What about dynamite? You have any?
- None.

01:13:34.083 --> 01:13:38.168
Less than a hundred rifles,
a few machetes and not much more.

01:13:38.209 --> 01:13:41.333
Even drunk,
the French'll blow your heads off.

01:13:41.375 --> 01:13:46.459
You don't know my men. Each one
tough, courageous, a Mexican patriot.

01:13:49.918 --> 01:13:53.668
Isn't that sweet?
But I happen to be a Hogan patriot

01:13:53.709 --> 01:13:56.210
and I'd like to have some dynamite.

01:13:56.252 --> 01:14:00.959
You show me the tree it's growing on,
I'll have my men pick it.

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:04.794
Probably plenty for sale
across the border in Texas.

01:14:04.835 --> 01:14:07.711
Yeah, but that takes money.

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:11.460
Even the food you ate
and that bottle were donated to us.

01:14:11.502 --> 01:14:14.420
We leave for Chihuahua tomorrow.

01:14:14.461 --> 01:14:18.128
You can come with us
and fight under my orders, my way,

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:21.586
or go back to that Texas bar
that I found you in.

01:14:25.503 --> 01:14:29.671
I'm in on this deal and no son
of a bitch is taking me out of it.

01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:44.962
If any other bastard spoke to me
like that, he would be dead.

01:14:45.004 --> 01:14:47.339
But since you have helped Mexico,

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:52.255
I am giving you a chance to get on
your horse and leave this camp alive.

01:14:53.379 --> 01:14:58.464
- Now get out of here fast.
- I ain't leavin' here.

01:15:00.131 --> 01:15:05.172
Colonel, please. This ring,
it's gold. It'll buy dynamite.

01:15:05.214 --> 01:15:08.756
Perhaps your people
have other things that could be sold.

01:15:08.798 --> 01:15:13.174
If someone shows me back to Santa
Maria, I'll go begging for help.

01:15:13.216 --> 01:15:17.381
Dynamite would save the lives
of some of my men.

01:15:18.465 --> 01:15:21.841
I told you
I was staying in this deal, Colonel,

01:15:21.882 --> 01:15:27.424
cos you know nobody in Texas is gonna
sell a load of dynamite to a Mexican.

01:15:29.507 --> 01:15:33.258
I am asking you,
buy dynamite for us.

01:15:34.133 --> 01:15:36.674
I'd love to.

01:15:36.716 --> 01:15:40.717
Oh, Sister.
You better sew this back on.

01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:48.550
You don't want to have those people
see you going around half-dressed.

01:15:51.092 --> 01:15:54.176
This is better than
killing each other, no?

01:15:54.218 --> 01:15:58.842
I only figured there was gonna be
one funeral - Catholic.

01:15:58.883 --> 01:16:03.593
I didn't know
that you were Catholic.

01:16:12.762 --> 01:16:14.761
Hogan.

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:18.846
Easy, Hogan. There are no
Yaquis arrows here, just a nun.

01:16:24.305 --> 01:16:26.971
- How did you do?
- I'm not sure.

01:16:27.013 --> 01:16:30.389
You must know if
you've got something worthwhile.

01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:33.764
I just don't know how much
it'll bring in Texas.

01:16:35.555 --> 01:16:37.430
You don't?

01:16:37.472 --> 01:16:41.473
This will buy enough
dynamite to give my horse a rupture.

01:16:41.515 --> 01:16:44.555
You did real well for me, Sister.

01:16:44.597 --> 01:16:48.015
For the cause.

01:16:49.431 --> 01:16:54.307
Maybe this will buy you a bottle of
medicine to keep your arm well-oiled.

01:16:54.349 --> 01:16:56.473
- Can you give this?
- I want to.

01:16:56.515 --> 01:17:00.766
I like you better as a Juarista
than as a nun, little Sister.

01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:06.391
Well, I'll just see you in Chihuahua.

01:17:06.432 --> 01:17:11.724
Right. If we take the fort,
we'll owe ourselves a celebration.

01:17:11.766 --> 01:17:15.100
I might even put a little whiskey
in your lemonade.

01:17:15.142 --> 01:17:18.391
- I'd like to talk to you...
- Your horses are here.

01:17:18.432 --> 01:17:22.183
My packhorse has some handguns
and some Winchesters.

01:17:22.225 --> 01:17:25.308
- You'll know what to do with them.
- Gracias.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:28.433
A gift from some old friends
of Sister Sara's.

01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:31.892
Could we talk?

01:17:31.933 --> 01:17:36.809
I can't, Sister. I need every second
to get where I'm going.

01:17:37.933 --> 01:17:40.018
Where are we gonna meet up?

01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:44.559
Just outside of Chihuahua riding
south, there is a little church.

01:17:44.601 --> 01:17:48.351
Be there as early as you can
on the morning of the 14th.

01:17:48.393 --> 01:17:50.309
Good riding.

01:17:50.351 --> 01:17:54.435
Don't let those French spend
that money before we can get there.

01:17:54.477 --> 01:17:56.810
- Goodbye, Sister.
- Goodbye.

01:18:37.481 --> 01:18:40.607
- Hello, Mr Hogan.
- How do, Sister?

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:44.691
- Glad to see you're back safe.
- Waiting for the dynamite?

01:18:44.732 --> 01:18:47.274
- And you.
- What, me personal?

01:18:47.316 --> 01:18:49.607
- I missed you.
- Yeah.

01:18:49.649 --> 01:18:54.525
It's felt kinda wrong the past few
days not having you slowing me up.

01:18:55.775 --> 01:18:58.399
- Did it?
- Yeah, damn it.

01:18:58.441 --> 01:19:00.400
What's the matter?

01:19:01.817 --> 01:19:05.401
Well, you see,
there's a problem, Sister...

01:19:05.443 --> 01:19:09.233
I should have never met up with you
in the first place.

01:19:09.275 --> 01:19:11.358
Come, Beltran's waiting.

01:19:30.569 --> 01:19:35.070
Where have you been? There are
only a few more hours of daylight.

01:19:35.111 --> 01:19:38.861
I had to go to three towns but
I've got all the dynamite we need,

01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:40.778
plus plenty of cigars.

01:19:46.895 --> 01:19:49.186
My men will leave for the church.

01:19:49.228 --> 01:19:53.729
- How many men do you have?
- Over 100. Let us go.

01:23:11.151 --> 01:23:13.234
The garrison's on that side.

01:23:13.276 --> 01:23:16.776
They must be drunk already,
I don't hear any singing.

01:23:19.109 --> 01:23:21.193
Hogan.

01:23:55.528 --> 01:23:58.529
Nobody's drunk.
Nobody's even drinking.

01:23:58.571 --> 01:24:00.279
You got your calendars mixed up.

01:24:00.321 --> 01:24:03.404
No. It is their
Independence Day, July the 14th.

01:24:03.446 --> 01:24:07.321
It is the train you blew up.
It put them on the alert.

01:24:07.363 --> 01:24:10.947
To attack now would be suicide.
Surprise is impossible.

01:24:10.989 --> 01:24:14.571
Without surprise,
I never attack superior forces.

01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:16.989
Instead of giving up,
listen a minute.

01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:21.697
I am listening but I have my mind
on my men, yours is only on money.

01:24:21.739 --> 01:24:23.947
I know how we can get a surprise.

01:24:23.989 --> 01:24:27.905
Three streets from here
is the bishop's old house.

01:24:27.947 --> 01:24:30.906
To protect him in the rainy season
there was a tunnel.

01:24:30.948 --> 01:24:34.114
It led to the garrison
when it used to be a monastery.

01:24:34.155 --> 01:24:38.906
After the bishop moved, it was
walled up. You can break through.

01:24:38.948 --> 01:24:42.115
- Who lives there now?
- Very good friends of mine.

01:24:42.156 --> 01:24:45.156
- Trustworthy?
- Yes. Very trustworthy.

01:24:45.198 --> 01:24:47.781
Good, I got something that'll work.

01:24:47.823 --> 01:24:49.949
- What?
- Fire.

01:24:49.991 --> 01:24:53.199
When you were giving
those Spanish lessons,

01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:57.241
you ever get a peek at
where they kept the garrison money?

01:25:10.117 --> 01:25:14.367
They used to pay me from a strongbox
in the general's office.

01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:16.908
Second floor in that building there.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:19.950
- Was it iron or wood?
- Iron.

01:25:19.992 --> 01:25:23.118
Great. That means it won't burn.

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:28.033
Now, I figure we separate
your men into four groups,

01:25:28.075 --> 01:25:30.576
giving them coal oil and dynamite,

01:25:30.618 --> 01:25:33.368
and let the first group
hit that main gate.

01:25:33.409 --> 01:25:37.243
The second group goes through
that tunnel into the courtyard.

01:25:37.284 --> 01:25:39.909
The third group
hits that gate over there.

01:25:39.951 --> 01:25:44.785
The fourth group, made up of your
best riflemen, we'll have up here.

01:25:44.827 --> 01:25:48.994
They can pick off the sentries
and set fire to the garrison.

01:25:49.035 --> 01:25:51.785
This all has to happen
at the same time.

01:25:51.827 --> 01:25:55.495
First we shall wait
for the cover of night.

01:25:55.536 --> 01:25:58.077
And second, some women and children

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:00.744
carrying a piñata
filled with dynamite

01:26:00.785 --> 01:26:03.120
might get close enough to that gate.

01:26:03.161 --> 01:26:06.078
What's a piñata?

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.370
It's an old Mexican way
of livening up a party.

01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:11.286
Come, come.

01:26:34.914 --> 01:26:38.789
- Sarita, baby!
- Rosanna!

01:26:38.830 --> 01:26:43.039
You are safe.
They didn't get you!

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:45.456
They didn't get my favorite girl!

01:26:47.165 --> 01:26:49.747
Sister Sara, this here's a cathouse.

01:26:49.789 --> 01:26:52.998
Oh, no, Hogan. This is no cathouse.

01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:56.956
It's the best whorehouse in town.

01:26:59.166 --> 01:27:01.915
Day and night
out there in that desert,

01:27:01.956 --> 01:27:04.040
you made a sucker out of me?

01:27:04.081 --> 01:27:06.291
I didn't want to. You forced me to.

01:27:06.332 --> 01:27:09.332
What are you talking about,
I forced you to?

01:27:09.374 --> 01:27:12.291
What did you say
when we saw the cavalry?

01:27:12.332 --> 01:27:15.457
If I wasn't a nun,
you'd let me save my own bacon.

01:27:15.499 --> 01:27:19.292
After I told you about the garrison
you said if I wasn't a nun,

01:27:19.333 --> 01:27:20.874
you'd say adiós.

01:27:20.916 --> 01:27:23.582
I wanted to be with you,
I wanted to be safe.

01:27:23.624 --> 01:27:27.167
I tried to tell you at the camp
but you were too busy.

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:31.084
Don't look so surprised,
you no-good atheist, move!

01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:34.917
It could be, you know,
I saved your bacon - again.

01:27:47.493 --> 01:27:49.994
Hogan, the piñata.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:06.161
- Got the coal oil?
- Yes.

01:28:07.244 --> 01:28:11.786
Have them put this thing against
the building outside the gate.

01:28:11.828 --> 01:28:15.286
- How long is the fuse?
- Approximately 30 seconds.

01:28:15.328 --> 01:28:17.703
That'll be enough time to get away.

01:28:17.745 --> 01:28:20.911
There will be
women and children, remember.

01:28:20.953 --> 01:28:23.496
Any longer fuse might be seen.

01:28:23.537 --> 01:28:26.179
Don't make the children too young
or the women too old

01:28:26.221 --> 01:28:28.303
and tell 'em not to trip.

01:28:41.122 --> 01:28:43.622
Hogan, the tunnel is open.

01:29:14.751 --> 01:29:18.833
My men will have them free.

01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:08.795
I can't budge it.

01:30:09.878 --> 01:30:13.129
If we use dynamite,
the element of surprise is gone.

01:30:13.171 --> 01:30:16.713
They'd have to open the door
if they had another prisoner.

01:30:16.754 --> 01:30:18.838
The French want me very badly.

01:30:18.879 --> 01:30:21.838
Why don't you turn me over
and ask for a reward?

01:30:24.046 --> 01:30:28.755
Even if they don't put you in here,
it will get Hogan inside the gate.

01:30:28.797 --> 01:30:31.546
It is a chance to open this door.

01:30:38.089 --> 01:30:41.964
I don't like it.
We'll find another way.

01:30:42.005 --> 01:30:44.880
- What other way?
- Let me think about it.

01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:48.381
- There's no time to think about it.
- I still don't like it.

01:30:48.423 --> 01:30:51.380
We have to get that
trap door open, don't we?

01:30:51.422 --> 01:30:54.590
What you're talking about's
crazy, Sara.

01:30:54.631 --> 01:30:58.756
Listen, Hogan, everybody's got
a right to be a sucker once.

01:31:10.466 --> 01:31:13.757
How can we be sure we hit 'em
all at the same time?

01:31:13.799 --> 01:31:16.882
I will put a man
in the belfry of the church.

01:31:16.924 --> 01:31:20.258
When he sees you and Sara
entering the garrison,

01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:23.382
he will ring the bells three times.

01:31:23.424 --> 01:31:27.508
The women with the piñata
will start up the street slowly.

01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:31.050
From the time you enter the gate
and the bells ring,

01:31:31.092 --> 01:31:35.008
it will be four minutes
till the explosion.

01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:40.426
- Slow 'em up. Make it six.
- Six.

01:31:40.468 --> 01:31:43.468
All right.
Let's go give a Spanish lesson.

01:32:12.678 --> 01:32:14.761
Hold it.

01:32:14.803 --> 01:32:19.220
I don't know how this is gonna
come out but I owe this to myself.

01:32:25.554 --> 01:32:28.678
- We'd better go.
- Bad time for a war.

01:32:29.886 --> 01:32:31.346
Bad time.

01:33:13.348 --> 01:33:15.599
Anybody in there speak English?

01:33:16.182 --> 01:33:20.056
What is it you wish here?

01:33:20.098 --> 01:33:23.891
I... have something out here
I think will interest you.

01:33:38.433 --> 01:33:40.932
Come on, you little cottontail.

01:33:48.183 --> 01:33:51.933
The Général himself
will want to meet you.

01:33:51.975 --> 01:33:54.475
Oh, Captain, wait just a minute.

01:33:54.517 --> 01:33:58.434
I've just about had a bellyful
of this little Juarista.

01:33:58.476 --> 01:34:01.559
She's been yapping at me
for three days now.

01:34:01.601 --> 01:34:04.809
If your general wants to socialize
that's up to him

01:34:04.851 --> 01:34:07.851
but I'd sooner have her locked up
while we talk.

01:34:07.876 --> 01:34:09.076
I am sorry.

01:34:28.603 --> 01:34:32.020
They're gonna place
that piñata right outside.

01:34:32.061 --> 01:34:35.395
When I give you the signal,
you get ready to move.

01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:38.686
This little cottontail
sure wishes she had that cross back.

01:34:39.711 --> 01:34:41.711
The general will see you now.

01:35:10.772 --> 01:35:14.648
Excuse me, monsieur,
I'm certainly not laughing at you

01:35:14.690 --> 01:35:17.314
but at this, this costume.

01:35:19.314 --> 01:35:24.190
Come to think of it, we shall have
to shoot you dressed like that.

01:35:24.231 --> 01:35:30.565
I understand that raisin' money
for the Mexican army is a crime...

01:35:30.606 --> 01:35:35.107
- So is shooting a lieutenant.
- Did that bastard die?

01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:38.398
Yes, the lieutenant died
and you will, too.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.899
Monsieur, I am Général le Claire.

01:35:41.941 --> 01:35:44.232
My name's Hamilton, Général.

01:35:44.274 --> 01:35:47.816
- Tex to my friends.
- How do you do, monsieur?

01:35:47.857 --> 01:35:51.441
How come you caught
this little pigeon for us?

01:35:51.482 --> 01:35:55.525
Well, you see,
I have this spread up north

01:35:55.567 --> 01:35:58.192
and in rides this nun...

01:36:16.145 --> 01:36:19.394
And when I heard that,
I said to myself,

01:36:19.435 --> 01:36:23.936
"Tex, you just got to haul her
on down here and turn her in."

01:36:25.020 --> 01:36:29.270
I hate them damn Juaristas.
Do nothing but cause me trouble.

01:36:29.311 --> 01:36:33.520
They got my Mexes laying around
just praying for independence.

01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:36.313
You didn't know
we had posted a reward?

01:36:36.354 --> 01:36:39.103
- A reward?
- 200 gold francs.

01:36:39.145 --> 01:36:41.353
How about that?

01:36:41.395 --> 01:36:45.563
Certainly better than
a stab in the eye with a sharp stick.

01:36:47.188 --> 01:36:50.604
Why don't you just lock her up
and send me on my way?

01:36:50.646 --> 01:36:52.813
Lock her up? No, monsieur.

01:36:52.854 --> 01:36:57.189
Condemned prisoners are entitled
to a last night of relaxation.

01:36:57.230 --> 01:37:01.229
- Wine or cognac, Sara?
- Cognac, a full glass, please.

01:37:01.271 --> 01:37:05.022
Anything my sweet-tempered
little pigeon desires.

01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:10.023
Colonel, please bring 200 francs.

01:37:11.647 --> 01:37:14.898
Monsieur Hamilton? Tex?

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.606
Make mine smaller than the one you
poured her. I'm just a country boy.

01:37:21.273 --> 01:37:25.399
To your virtues
and especially your vices, Sara.

01:37:25.441 --> 01:37:27.773
What a pity to bury them both.

01:37:43.983 --> 01:37:46.067
Excuse me, Monsieur Hamilton.

01:37:46.108 --> 01:37:49.275
A people who know how to sing -
the Mexicans.

01:37:49.317 --> 01:37:53.192
- Are you familiar with that melody?
- Can't say that I am.

01:37:53.817 --> 01:37:59.026
Las Mañanitas, for birthdays
and weddings and whatnot. Lovely.

01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.359
My, how touching.

01:38:12.401 --> 01:38:16.152
They know it is our independence day
and they come to toast us.

01:38:16.194 --> 01:38:19.944
- Do you know what a piñata is?
- Can't say that I do.

01:38:19.985 --> 01:38:22.569
Come and see. A charming invention.

01:38:26.902 --> 01:38:30.153
They build an animal figure
from papier-mâché

01:38:30.195 --> 01:38:33.235
with a clay jar hidden
in the center of the body.

01:38:33.277 --> 01:38:36.570
They fill it with candies,
nuts, fruits and toys

01:38:36.611 --> 01:38:38.903
and suspend it from a tree.

01:38:50.613 --> 01:38:53.528
Now, that's real cute.

01:39:17.855 --> 01:39:19.398
Come on.

01:39:26.148 --> 01:39:27.898
Over here.

01:39:30.815 --> 01:39:35.856
Get back to the house and pour
yourself another... cognac.

01:44:44.586 --> 01:44:48.752
- Where's Sara?
- Last door. Hall left. My room.

01:45:06.379 --> 01:45:09.379
- Sara, open up.
- I'm taking a bath!

01:45:09.420 --> 01:45:11.296
Well, get out of the bath.

01:45:11.337 --> 01:45:16.339
Will you come back later?
I want to be all dressed up for you.

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:19.047
Who the hell
wants to see you dressed?

01:45:39.923 --> 01:45:42.756
The least you can do
is take off your hat.

01:45:42.798 --> 01:45:45.756
I haven't got time for that.

01:46:14.508 --> 01:46:17.133
Come on!
