00:19.117 --> 00:20.951
It's just that my sinuses

00:20.952 --> 00:22.536

You were great.

giving this a lot of thought.

02:21.537 --> 02:23.538
Is that why I got
an incomplete,

02:24.807 --> 02:26.307
No.

02:27.143 --> 02:28.593
Oh.

02:28.594 --> 02:31.095
Can you think of any reasons
why we shouldn't live together?

02:31.096 --> 02:34.182
Uh, no,
not off the top of my head.

02:34.183 --> 02:36.601
Which you were staring at
for quite a while.

02:41.774 --> 02:43.942
Look, I don't want
to back you into a corner.

02:43.943 --> 02:45.326
Why don't you
think about it.

02:45.327 --> 02:48.062
Yeah, yeah, why don't I sit
with it for a day or two.

02:48.063 --> 02:50.081
And you can think about
why you love me.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.333
Okay.

02:53.202 --> 02:54.252
Mm.

02:54.253 --> 02:57.839
Oh, I guess I should
be getting home soon.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.241
If you lived here,
you'd be home already.

03:00.242 --> 03:01.676
That's true.

03:01.677 --> 03:04.245

03:04.246 --> 03:06.247
"If you lived here,

can't help but think,

03:08.267 --> 03:10.768

a big sign outside my window

03:10.769 --> 03:13.754
ruining my perfectly
good view of the freeway.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.807

next to the freeway,

03:15.808 --> 03:18.193

getting this.

Cash for Gold,

03:40.224 --> 03:41.958

03:41.959 --> 03:44.745
selling her wedding ring
for $500.

03:44.746 --> 03:46.596
No, I don't want to sell gold.

I want to meet that woman.

03:48.365 --> 03:49.883

04:06.951 --> 04:08.869
Lyndsey told me
she loves me tonight.

04:08.870 --> 04:09.936
Really? What'd you say?

04:09.937 --> 04:14.107
What could I say?
"I love you, too."

Oh, I don't know.

04:19.747 --> 04:24.167
Her mood swings,
her idiot teenage son

04:24.168 --> 04:25.702
and the fact that you need
a muscle relaxer,

04:25.703 --> 04:28.572
a bottle of wine and
a jackhammer to get her off.

04:30.741 --> 04:34.410
Hey, I told you about that
in confidence.

04:35.246 --> 04:37.264
Who else is here?

The same two people know.

04:41.302 --> 04:44.855
All right, well,
let's keep it that way.

04:44.856 --> 04:48.058
She also said she wants me
to move in with her.

04:48.059 --> 04:51.645
Is that forever
or just till you get her off?

to move out of here

05:00.788 --> 05:02.272
and in with her.

05:02.273 --> 05:04.875

Well, that's great.
Congratulations.

05:09.080 --> 05:11.181
I don't know.

05:11.182 --> 05:12.999
I told her I'd think about it.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.334
What's to think about?

05:14.335 --> 05:16.253
She's a terrific gal and
she can make you happy.

05:16.254 --> 05:17.804

05:17.805 --> 05:20.140
Oh, please, that was

You, you're cheap, annoying
and no one likes you.

05:32.436 --> 05:34.137
Lyndsey likes me.

05:34.138 --> 05:36.523
Which is why you should
move in with her.

05:36.524 --> 05:39.075
But this is my home,
I'm comfortable here.

05:39.076 --> 05:41.477
No, no, no, no,

it, I was comfortable here.

miss me if I was gone?

05:57.512 --> 06:01.181
I'm saying I'd very much
like the chance to find out.

06:01.182 --> 06:04.134
Please, Alan,
give me that chance.

06:04.135 --> 06:05.852
No, I don't think so.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.677
All right, bottom line,
what would it take

10:57.678 --> 10:59.462
to make you want to
move in with Lyndsey?

10:59.463 --> 11:02.182
For the last time, there is
no conceivable circumstance

11:02.183 --> 11:03.766
where I would entertain
leaving Malibu

11:03.767 --> 11:05.101
and moving in with Lyndsey.

11:06.270 --> 11:08.071
Next time you drop the
soap in the shower,

11:08.072 --> 11:10.907
I'm gonna forget
you're my brother.

11:10.908 --> 11:13.660
Jake, your father's here!

11:13.661 --> 11:14.944
Hello, Alan.

11:14.945 --> 11:16.496
Charlie. How's it going?

11:16.497 --> 11:17.497
Great.

11:17.498 --> 11:19.032
Did you hear
Lyndsey MacElroy

11:19.033 --> 11:20.533
invited Alan to
move in with her?

11:20.534 --> 11:21.584
What?

11:21.585 --> 11:22.652
She lives right down the street.

11:22.653 --> 11:24.287
I know. You and Alan
would be neighbors.

11:24.288 --> 11:25.388
Cool, huh?
Now, hang on.

11:25.389 --> 11:27.040
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

11:27.041 --> 11:28.691
You bet your ass
you're not gonna do it.

11:28.692 --> 11:31.177
I will not have my ex-husband
living down the street from me.

11:31.178 --> 11:33.763
So you're saying it would
make you uncomfortable?

11:33.764 --> 11:34.797
Uncomfortable?

11:34.798 --> 11:36.199
It would drive me crazy.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.602
Jake, damn it,
get a move on!

11:39.603 --> 11:41.304
I'm moving in with Lyndsey.

Awesome.
Great.

11:50.490 --> 11:52.324
It's a new takeout place.

11:52.325 --> 11:53.659
A little more expensive,

11:53.660 --> 11:55.160
but it's worth it.

11:55.161 --> 11:57.663
And for dessert, we have
red velvet cupcakes.

11:57.664 --> 11:59.064
Oh, man, those are my favorite.

11:59.065 --> 12:01.116
Hang on, Eldridge.

12:02.085 --> 12:04.787
Something's wrong here.

12:06.690 --> 12:08.958
Are you sending us
to military school?

12:08.959 --> 12:10.626
No.

12:10.627 --> 12:12.227
Of course not.
Why would you think that?

12:12.228 --> 12:13.345
I don't know.

12:13.346 --> 12:15.130
16 years of bargain
pizza with fake cheese

12:15.131 --> 12:17.516
and Sam's Club vanilla
wafers for dessert?

12:19.585 --> 12:21.520
I don't want to go
to military school.

12:21.521 --> 12:23.522
No one's going
to military school.

12:23.523 --> 12:26.809
But there is, uh, something
we wanted to talk to you about.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.978
Here it comes.

12:28.979 --> 12:30.479
Relax, it's good news.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.697
Alan.

12:31.698 --> 12:33.999
All right, uh, as you both know,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.768
uh, Lyndsey and I have been
dating now for six months.

12:36.769 --> 12:39.321
Oh, man, did he
knock you up?

12:39.322 --> 12:40.873
No.

12:40.874 --> 12:42.607
Just be quiet and listen.

12:42.608 --> 12:44.776
Anyway, uh, we've both grown

12:44.777 --> 12:46.779
very fond of each other
during that time.

12:46.780 --> 12:48.881
You are using
protection, right?

12:48.882 --> 12:51.000
That's none of your business,

12:51.001 --> 12:53.218
but I'm glad you're paying
attention in health class.

12:53.219 --> 12:55.454
Uh, but what
I'm trying to say

12:55.455 --> 12:57.723
is that Lyndsey and I

12:57.724 --> 12:58.874
have decided

12:58.875 --> 13:00.092
to live together.

13:01.978 --> 13:03.712
I don't think Uncle Charlie's
gonna like that.

13:03.713 --> 13:06.398
He's never been real pleased
that you and I moved in.

13:07.267 --> 13:08.867
Uh, no, no, no.

13:08.868 --> 13:11.170
We're going to live at
Lyndsey's and Eldridge's house.

13:11.171 --> 13:12.471
But I stay here, right?

13:12.472 --> 13:14.189
No. When you're not
at your mom's,

13:14.190 --> 13:15.324
you'll be with us.

13:15.325 --> 13:17.826
So, I'm losing
my weekend beach house?

13:17.827 --> 13:20.863
Yeah, but you're gaining
a whole family.

13:20.864 --> 13:22.981
I'd rather have
a weekend beach house.

13:22.982 --> 13:25.617
Do I have to share
my bathroom with him?

13:25.618 --> 13:26.785
Eldridge.

13:26.786 --> 13:28.037
What's wrong with sharing
a bathroom with me?

13:28.038 --> 13:29.204
I like my privacy.

13:29.205 --> 13:30.622
Yeah, we all know
what that's about.

13:30.623 --> 13:31.407
Jake!

13:31.408 --> 13:33.208
You're Mr. Whack-a-Mole, not me.

13:33.209 --> 13:35.094
Yeah, well, at least
I don't watch gay porn.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.463
That was a total accident!

13:37.464 --> 13:39.264
I don't want to
live with him.

13:39.265 --> 13:40.699
Well, you don't have to worry
about it, 'cause I'm not going.

13:40.700 --> 13:42.418
Guys, guys, come on.
No!

13:42.419 --> 13:43.769
Forget it. I mean,
it's bad enough

13:43.770 --> 13:45.070
you're sleeping
with this loser.

13:45.071 --> 13:45.954
Eldridge!

13:45.955 --> 13:47.156
Are you calling my dad a loser?

13:47.157 --> 13:48.941
You call him a loser
all the time.

13:48.942 --> 13:50.442
He's my dad, I'm allowed.

13:50.443 --> 13:52.928
Uh, well, Jake, technically
you're not allowed.

13:52.929 --> 13:55.013
Is it okay for me to call
your mom what you call her?

13:55.014 --> 13:56.148
What do you call me?
Okay,

13:56.149 --> 13:57.399
we've gotten
off track here.

13:58.401 --> 13:59.952
Uh, who's ready for cupcakes?

13:59.953 --> 14:01.737
Screw you and your cupcakes.

14:01.738 --> 14:02.955
Yeah.

you're never paying me back.

the wrong way, Alan.

with those two

17:58.107 --> 18:00.976
hot soap opera actresses,
and then we both got the flu?

18:01.978 --> 18:03.312
Soap opera actresses...

18:05.231 --> 18:06.865
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

18:06.866 --> 18:08.099
Drive carefully.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.284
Oh, come on.

18:09.285 --> 18:11.536
Um, how about when you found me
handcuffed to my bed

18:11.537 --> 18:14.105
wearing a bustier
and fishnet stockings?

18:16.909 --> 18:18.910
Sorry. Blanking on that, too.

18:18.911 --> 18:20.796
Well, yeah, but-but you got
to remember when we did the...

18:20.797 --> 18:22.414
Alan, Alan, Alan,
let me save you some trouble.

18:22.415 --> 18:24.616

things I can't remember

18:24.617 --> 18:26.301
and things I don't want
to remember.

18:26.302 --> 18:28.119
And you're both.

18:29.955 --> 18:30.972
Right.

18:30.973 --> 18:33.141
Then, uh, wish me luck.

18:33.142 --> 18:35.510
You don't need luck.

18:35.511 --> 18:37.312
You guys were meant
for each other.

18:37.313 --> 18:40.482

store on the way

pick up a bottle

18:43.986 --> 18:45.070
of champagne to celebrate
with Lyndsey.

18:45.071 --> 18:47.022
A hundred bucks?

18:47.023 --> 18:49.808
For that kind of cash,
I could get a very decent bottle

18:49.809 --> 18:52.027
of Chardonnay and still have
some walking around money.

18:52.028 --> 18:53.812

18:53.813 --> 18:56.114
Right. It's your money.

We end as we began.

19:41.544 --> 19:42.878
Mm. Here you are.

19:42.879 --> 19:44.763
That's a hundred-dollar bill.

19:44.764 --> 19:47.716
You owe me $91.51.

19:50.803 --> 19:51.837
Alan?

19:51.838 --> 19:53.605
Melissa?

19:53.606 --> 19:55.140
What a coincidence.

19:55.141 --> 19:56.591
Yeah! How have you been?

19:56.592 --> 19:57.709
Okay. You?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.144
Fine.

19:59.145 --> 19:59.928
How's Jake?

19:59.929 --> 20:01.596
Oh, uh, he's good.

20:01.597 --> 20:02.314
Charlie?

20:02.315 --> 20:03.932
Ah, same old.

20:03.933 --> 20:05.767
You look great.

20:05.768 --> 20:07.052
You, too. Gorgeous.

20:07.053 --> 20:08.052
Aw, thanks.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.489
I've missed you.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.157
I've missed you, too.

20:12.158 --> 20:13.575
So, seeing anybody?

20:13.576 --> 20:15.410
Nope. You?

20:16.245 --> 20:18.163
No.

20:24.537 --> 20:26.488
♪ Men. ♪

20:27.478 --> 20:28.898
<i>♪ Men. ♪</i>

20:28.945 --> 20:30.478
<i>Must be real important</i>

20:30.479 --> 20:33.565
for you to call me out in the
middle of the night like this.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.450
You're doing God's work.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.519
Excuse me, pardon me.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.854
Alan?
I'll explain later.

20:39.855 --> 20:40.855
Hey, Charlie.

20:40.856 --> 20:42.374
Hey.

20:42.375 --> 20:45.377
Don't worry, I'm still
moving in with Lyndsey.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.412
This will just be
my pied-à-terre.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.918
Uh, that's French
for "love shack."

20:56.889 --> 21:00.892
Okay, that's it.
Let me speak to your supervisor.
