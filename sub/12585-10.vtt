WEBVTT

00:32.032 --> 00:33.324
-
Yup.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.576
Yup.

00:34.659 --> 00:36.119
-Mm-hmm.

00:36.202 --> 00:37.245
Hey, hillbillies,

00:37.328 --> 00:39.414
my delinquent nephew coming to town.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.582
Don't buy him beer!

00:40.665 --> 00:43.126
I know rednecks like to buy beer for kids.

00:43.209 --> 00:45.086
He'll ask. He like to party.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.546
Don't buy him beer!

00:48.214 --> 00:51.092
Hey, you guys wanna come
to my vernal equinox party tomorrow?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.052
No.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.970
Before you answer, remember,

00:54.054 --> 00:56.681
the vernal equinox is when the stars align

00:56.765 --> 00:59.726
in the configuration
of an arrow pointing to Earth,

00:59.809 --> 01:02.771
as if to say, "Come visit here."

01:02.854 --> 01:07.442
I'll read a thoughtful essay.
We'll shriek ceremoniously and eat tapas!

01:07.525 --> 01:08.777
God, no.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.070
-Hey, guys!

01:10.153 --> 01:11.946
Ow! My knee!

01:12.030 --> 01:15.742
Bill, you got to promise me
you won't do that in front of the aliens.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.452
They hate slapstick.

01:17.535 --> 01:19.079
-

01:20.038 --> 01:20.872
<i>Nancy,</i>

01:20.955 --> 01:22.749
have you begun making the tapas?

01:22.832 --> 01:26.419
This will be the visitors'
first experience with food on this planet.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.047
I want them to have a little taste
of everything.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.884
Is this gonna shrink down?

01:32.967 --> 01:34.135
This is huge!

01:34.219 --> 01:35.887
What, what will I tell the aliens?

01:35.970 --> 01:37.097
"I hope you like this,

01:37.180 --> 01:39.265
because if you don't,
there's nothing else"?

01:39.349 --> 01:41.851
Dale, I'm doing the best I can.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.145
I'm sorry I don't know alien protocol.

01:44.229 --> 01:46.981
Come on, seven!

01:48.274 --> 01:49.400
Seven!

01:49.484 --> 01:52.487
That's the third seven in a row
you've blown out of your nose.

01:52.570 --> 01:54.239
You're amazing!

01:54.322 --> 01:56.991
It's either lucky dice or a lucky nose.

01:57.075 --> 01:59.369
There's only one way to find out.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.997
Boys, please stop that!

02:03.081 --> 02:05.667
I don't have time to take anyone
to the emergency room!

02:09.129 --> 02:10.588

02:24.602 --> 02:28.064
Now, be sure you've got your phone off
when the aliens get here.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.942
It could startle them,
which could result in our death.

02:31.025 --> 02:32.986
Not to mention, it's pretty rude.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.867
Hey, Nancy, did you know that
John Redcorn, the children's musician,

02:38.950 --> 02:40.702
has been trying to reach you here
at the station?

02:40.785 --> 02:44.205
Well, I, I have no idea why.
I barely know that guy.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.082
Well, he seems to know you.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.542
I want you to do a feature on him.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.544
What?! But I do news.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.671
We're moving you off
the news desk to features.

02:51.754 --> 02:54.132
It seems, people aren't interested
in hard news anymore.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.801
They say it's "boring"
and makes them "sad".

02:56.926 --> 03:00.346
That is not my fault. I always said
we shouldn't do the sad stuff.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.891
No, people love you. Look at this mail.

03:02.974 --> 03:04.267
"We love the blonde woman."

03:04.350 --> 03:08.271
And, "Nancy real good."
And, "I wanna lay with blondie."

03:08.354 --> 03:10.481
Really? Oh, that's flattering!

03:10.607 --> 03:14.027
But, um, shouldn't I start
with a better get than John Redcorn?

03:14.110 --> 03:17.030
No, Redcorn's hot.
He's burning up the pre-tween market.

03:17.113 --> 03:20.074
And can you see
if he'll play my stepkid's birthday?

03:20.158 --> 03:21.951
Of course, I get stuck
organizing the party

03:22.035 --> 03:24.537
because my stepkid's real dad's too busy.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.080
Too busy? Too drunk!

03:30.710 --> 03:33.504
And... it's equinox!

03:50.730 --> 03:51.898
Gih!

04:01.241 --> 04:03.785


04:03.868 --> 04:04.869
Alien?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.746
-A-len.
-Alien.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.539
Oh, my God, it worked!

04:08.623 --> 04:10.124


04:10.208 --> 04:12.710
Your language. It's beautiful!

04:12.794 --> 04:15.588


04:15.672 --> 04:17.799
You want me to get in there?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.885


04:21.386 --> 04:23.221
Okay, okay, I'll get in.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.183
Good-bye, Earth!

04:29.185 --> 04:30.853
-

04:32.146 --> 04:33.356
2048.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.400
Hey, your clock's on military time.

04:35.608 --> 04:38.236
Why would you have milita... Oh, my God!

04:38.319 --> 04:39.654
That's not the time.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.197
That's the year!

04:41.281 --> 04:43.324
You're not an alien.
You're a time traveler!

04:43.408 --> 04:46.077
Let me out of this thing! Eject!

04:52.375 --> 04:54.919
<i>♪ What do you do with a drunken bear? ♪</i>

04:55.003 --> 04:57.171

04:58.840 --> 05:00.508
Oh, I'm so glad

05:00.591 --> 05:02.969
that your regular makeup
lady got meningitis

05:03.052 --> 05:04.345
so I can do your makeups.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.680
That's great, shug.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.685
Did you get a cat?

05:10.768 --> 05:12.687
A blonde cat?

05:12.812 --> 05:14.731
Um, no.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.399
I don't have a cat.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.693
Nancy.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.903
John Redcorn.

05:23.364 --> 05:24.324
Go, Nancy.

05:24.407 --> 05:28.286
I'm Nancy Hicks-Gribble,
reporting live from Captain Bear's Pizza.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.454
John Redcorn,

05:29.537 --> 05:32.373
you enchant Arlen's children and tweens.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.292
Tell me about your personal style.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.086
I wore this vest especially for you.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.757
This is the Native American symbol
for forbidden love.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.383
Oh.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.260
Well, that's a fun fact.

05:44.385 --> 05:48.806
Um, speaking of fun,
what's your favorite local hot spot?

05:48.890 --> 05:51.351
<i>Remember when
we found your hot spot?</i>

05:51.434 --> 05:52.602
Bobby, room.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.021
But he's getting out his guitar.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.189
Now!

05:58.483 --> 06:01.903
You better call me
if he sings <i>The Oatmeal Blues.</i>

06:03.780 --> 06:06.532
I hope for Dale's sake
this isn't what it looks like.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.160
The... rekindling and whatnot.

06:09.243 --> 06:13.289
Nancy swore to me she would never whatnot
with that man again.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.792
<i>Guitar playing is about
strumming the instrument</i>

06:15.875 --> 06:17.794

Good night!

06:34.394 --> 06:36.354
And... clear.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.485
Luanne, would you help me
with this earpiece?

06:42.568 --> 06:44.362
Here. Let me help you.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.659
Is that my hair?

06:50.410 --> 06:52.328
You always did make me feel strong.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.467
I've done it! I've traveled to 2048!

07:07.635 --> 07:09.595
Al Gore was right.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.973
I wonder what ocean this used to be.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.103
And man has devolved back to crawling.

07:17.895 --> 07:19.313
No, wait, that's just me.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.902
It's times like this I wish
I had a friend named The Professor.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.575
Note to self. Don't make
too many notes to self.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.827
Probably can't get more cassettes.

07:39.584 --> 07:43.171
So, they changed the name
of Arlen to Fartland.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.048
Oh, cold, hilarious fate.

07:46.132 --> 07:49.385
What happened here that would
make them do such a thing?

07:53.681 --> 07:55.391
What can I do for you today?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.143
Your lips are looking a bit thin.

07:57.226 --> 08:00.188
You want me to plump them up
with some more of your butt fat?

08:00.271 --> 08:03.316
Well, sure, but first,
could you look at my hair?

08:03.399 --> 08:05.109
I think it's been falling out lately.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.029
Hmm. Hair's tough. Let me try something.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.032
Well, that should have hurt.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.783
What's happening to me?

08:12.867 --> 08:14.619
Well, it's difficult
to determine the cause

08:14.702 --> 08:17.788
of female hair loss,
and then it's hard to cure.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.207
So, what should I do?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.292
Well, there are some
shampoos on the market

08:21.375 --> 08:22.752
with outrageous claims.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.086
You could try those,

08:24.170 --> 08:27.256
but if they don't work,
you should be prepared for this.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.051
See, right now, you're here.

08:30.134 --> 08:33.221
In six months, you'll be... here.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.014
Oh, my God!

08:35.139 --> 08:38.267
Oh, I tried it again.
You're definitely losing your hair.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.119
What are you doing here, John Redcorn?

08:57.245 --> 08:58.454
I wrote a song for you.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.749
It's about a beautiful tree named Fancy.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.042
Ignore the end.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.462
The tree becomes a home for a squirrel
with body image issues.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.758
I'm sorry, John Redcorn,
but you've got to go.

09:11.133 --> 09:13.719
We broke up already.
It was hard, but it's done.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.974
Please, Nancy. Don't we owe it
to ourselves to be happy?

09:18.057 --> 09:20.309
What's John Redcorn doing here?

09:20.393 --> 09:21.727
Don't be obvious,

09:21.811 --> 09:25.356
but look over
at my one o'clock, your 6:30.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.735
Dang it, Boomhauer.
I said don't be obvious!

09:29.819 --> 09:32.321
I thought that whole business
was over with.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.324
Of course I still have that arrowhead.

09:35.908 --> 09:36.909
Huh.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.954
I thought in the future,
there'd be more things hovering.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.084
You must be Hank's grandson.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.044
I knew your grandfather.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.006
He was, hmm... okay.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.968
-A little jowlier than you.
-Cut that out.

09:54.051 --> 09:55.469
Hey, guys.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.346
Ow! My knee!

09:57.471 --> 09:58.514
Oh, my God.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.433
Bill's about to say, "I'm okay!"

10:00.516 --> 10:01.684
I'm okay.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.102
Wait.

10:03.185 --> 10:05.605
I wasn't transported to the future.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.107
I've been transported to the past.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.609
Yesterday!

10:12.820 --> 10:14.488
Oh, God, that's under the vest.

10:14.572 --> 10:15.531
Oh, no!

10:15.615 --> 10:17.450
We can't let this happen.

10:17.533 --> 10:20.119
If Nancy sees him
spouting all this nonsense,

10:20.202 --> 10:22.121
it's just gonna drive her back
to John Redcorn.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.166
Yeah, well, man, she ain't got
too god-dang ol' far to go, man.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.542
Oh, my God!

10:26.626 --> 10:29.337
If this is yesterday, then I could...

10:29.420 --> 10:31.631
run into myself.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.090
If that happens,

10:33.174 --> 10:35.676
the space-time continuum
will be compromised,

10:35.760 --> 10:37.762
and the world will explode!

10:37.845 --> 10:43.392
You know, Dale, we should probably keep
this time travel stuff between us,

10:43.476 --> 10:46.854
because if the government
finds out, they'll, uh...

10:46.937 --> 10:49.732
they'll do what, uh,
you know, the government does.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.859
Those bastards! You're right.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.154
I think the other me is close by.
I hear the sound of my voice.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.198
If I ask, I was never here.

11:00.951 --> 11:03.287
Nancy, your test results show
there's no medical reason

11:03.371 --> 11:04.372
for your hair loss.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.333
Your iron level is normal,
your glands all secrete perfectly,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.418
and your heart is in excellent condition.

11:09.543 --> 11:11.212
I don't care about my heart.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.172
My heart isn't admired on television!

11:13.255 --> 11:15.925
My heart wasn't voted
"prettiest heart" in high school!

11:16.008 --> 11:17.718
My heart isn't so high and thick

11:17.802 --> 11:20.429
it once had a low-flying bird
get stuck in it!

11:21.263 --> 11:23.849
Nancy, female hair loss is not uncommon.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.851
It's usually caused by stress or heredity.

11:25.935 --> 11:26.936
Well, it must be stress.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.355
The hair in my family gets
bigger every generation.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.650
Well, in that case, I've got
some great anti-anxiety medications

11:32.733 --> 11:33.609
I can prescribe.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.362
Let's go to Dr. Schiffie's cabinet,
see what we can do.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.781
Oh, you're really going to like these.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.032
Ala-kazam!

11:40.157 --> 11:42.535
Al-parazalam!

11:50.251 --> 11:52.086
This scarf is so pretty.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.130
Do you think it thinks I'm pretty?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.841
Man, these pills are great.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.385
So doctor say hair loss caused

11:59.468 --> 12:01.387
by something stressing you out?

12:01.470 --> 12:04.974
I say it toss up
between idiot husband and idiot son.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.017
Who you love and don't wanna hurt.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.061
I should wait in the car.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.689
I don't want my baby to catch your stress

12:12.106 --> 12:14.984
I am not giving birth to a bald baby.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.493
You think I'd be stressed out,
but I'm not.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.705
I feel freaking fantastic.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.922
You know, I'm addicted to these pills.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.261
Well, if it's not stress,
it must be heredity.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.389
I know what I have to do.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.690
-What the heck are you wearing?
-I'm going spelunking.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.860
I've got an extra headlamp
and backpack thingy with your name on it

12:57.985 --> 12:59.445
in masking tape.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.280
-You interested?
-No.

13:01.405 --> 13:02.281
Neither am I.

13:02.364 --> 13:05.242
That's why I know
I won't run into myself there.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.453
And after this, ice dancing.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.246
And then, flossing!

13:13.584 --> 13:16.045
Sorry to just drop in
on you like this, Mom.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.923
I lost my cell phone.
I've had the worst week.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.633
You've had a hard week.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.676
My footbath died.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.221
Then I had another one
of my recipes stolen.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.264
Mother, please. Just listen to me.

13:27.389 --> 13:28.766
Oh, all right.

13:28.849 --> 13:30.601
But Mommy needs her Xanax first.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.686
-You want one?
-No. No.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.523
Well... no.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.943
Look, I've lost some hair recently,

13:39.026 --> 13:39.860
and I was wondering

13:39.944 --> 13:42.530
if female hair loss runs
in our family at all.

13:43.239 --> 13:46.325
Bless me for being so honest
and such a good mother.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.162
Sugar bear, truth is,
my hair fell out long ago.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.330
This is a wig.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.706
Oh, my God!

13:52.790 --> 13:54.458
Don't tell your father.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.001
So, it is hereditary.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.044
Not exactly.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.296
We're not so dissimilar, you and I.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.632
Did I ever tell you about Frank Torres?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.425
Your life-drawing teacher?

14:03.509 --> 14:07.972
I remember every day of the ten years
we shared our secret love.

14:08.055 --> 14:11.892
Our affair was like floating
on a cloud made of a rainbow.

14:11.976 --> 14:16.188
Our lovemaking, exciting,
but virtually motionless.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.440
I, I can't believe what I'm hearing!

14:18.524 --> 14:23.070
Frank. How he loved to dance
wildly to no music at all,

14:23.153 --> 14:26.699
just the sound of the pounding
of his fist on his leg.

14:28.325 --> 14:29.243
All right,

14:29.326 --> 14:31.328
you've made your dramatic speech
for the night.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.122
Can we get back to my problem now?

14:33.247 --> 14:34.415
Sugar bear,

14:34.498 --> 14:38.043
I mention all this because the stress
of ending my affair with Frank

14:38.127 --> 14:40.462
is what brought on my hair loss.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.463
What?

14:41.547 --> 14:45.551
By the time my shrink discovered
my subconscious yearning was to blame,

14:45.634 --> 14:47.553
it was too late to get him back.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.138
He died.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.931
Just like my old footbath.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.975
So, what you're telling me is...

14:53.058 --> 14:54.643
if I want my hair back,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.271
I have to get back together
with John Redcorn?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.066
Or you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.780
Hey, Hank Hill, my nephew missing.

15:06.864 --> 15:10.701
If you see 17-year-old
in tricked-out hot rod, call the police.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.119
I always do.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.373
Hey, Nancy!

15:16.457 --> 15:19.209
I'm off to lifeguard school,
and I needed my Speedos.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.879
-What?
-No chance of seeing myself there.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.672
What is going on with you?

15:23.756 --> 15:25.382
Hank! Dale!

15:27.968 --> 15:30.346
Nancy, there's something
I think you should know.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.682
Okay, it's a long story. It begins

15:33.766 --> 15:35.809
when I got into a time machine.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.646
-Dale!
-Oh, right, I've got to be quick.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.398
Darn my love of flowery storytelling.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.943
Nancy, tomorrow's not guaranteed!

15:44.026 --> 15:45.653
You should live for now!

15:46.779 --> 15:49.406
Meaning, if you're thinking
about doing something,

15:49.490 --> 15:51.283
but are hesitant for some reason,

15:51.367 --> 15:53.035
you should go ahead and do it!

15:53.118 --> 15:55.245
Like wearing that crazy hat.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.956
You, too, John Redcorn.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.916
If there's something
you're thinking about doing,

15:58.999 --> 16:01.543
you might as well do it! Do it now!

16:05.172 --> 16:06.674
You heard him, Nancy.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.602
Now, let me get this straight.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.312
John Redcorn has to...

16:20.396 --> 16:22.523
love the hair back onto you?

16:22.606 --> 16:24.942
Uh-uh. That story cannot be true.

16:25.025 --> 16:29.363
Ooh, I bet Bunny's writing a fake memoir.
I'll warn Oprah.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.572
No, it's true.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.242
And if I don't get back together with him,
I'll go bald.

16:34.034 --> 16:37.788
Just like his broad,
smooth Native American chest.

16:37.871 --> 16:42.167
I know that giving yourself to Redcorn
would be both exhilarating and wonderful,

16:42.251 --> 16:43.836
but you are a married woman!

16:43.919 --> 16:48.048
But my hair is my job,
and my job is my family's livelihood.

16:48.132 --> 16:52.886
So I'd be sleeping with John Redcorn,
as if our lives depended on it.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.015
I know what Jesus would do.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.685
He would resist the temptation,
even if he had to go bald.

16:59.768 --> 17:00.978
And he had great hair.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.564
What am I gonna do?

17:03.647 --> 17:07.234
I'm just a swirling tempest
of emotions, shugs.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.902
Frustration!

17:08.986 --> 17:10.195
Humiliation.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.363
Fear.

17:11.447 --> 17:12.448
Desire.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.407
Guilt.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.908
Oh, just do it,

17:14.992 --> 17:17.995
but don't do it too much
or you end up with moustache.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.544


17:25.669 --> 17:26.670
Wow.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.173
This is gonna be a great party!

17:44.980 --> 17:47.149
So, I'll meet you there?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.985
Did he tell you where the party is?

17:58.660 --> 18:02.706
<i>♪ Then the squirrel loved herself
exactly as she was ♪</i>

18:05.167 --> 18:07.294
<i>♪ Thanks to the beautiful... ♪</i>

18:07.377 --> 18:08.545
<i>♪ Fancy ♪</i>

18:12.174 --> 18:13.967
Yeah!

18:23.811 --> 18:25.187
Um!

18:25.896 --> 18:27.106
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.108
Oh, I'm a friend of John Redcorn.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.653
Lady, all these women are
"friends of John Redcorn."

18:32.736 --> 18:33.904
Nancy!

18:35.489 --> 18:36.573
Hey!

18:37.407 --> 18:40.369
I assume you didn't come here
to get your caricature done with a monkey.

18:40.494 --> 18:42.996
But, if you want one,
I can get it at half price.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.707
I changed my mind, shug.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.335
Let's start what we finished.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.888
Fatal flaw!

18:59.972 --> 19:02.349
The end is approaching
quicker than anticipated.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.770
Okay, I don't know if you knew this,
but I can't use any toilet but my own,

19:06.854 --> 19:11.191
I can only hold my bodily fluids
for six days and 52 minutes.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.193
Yes, Dale, I'm well aware.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.028
So I have to go potty!

19:15.112 --> 19:18.740
I'm destined to run into myself
in my bathroom.

19:18.824 --> 19:21.827
Listen to me.
You have to stop talking about this.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.454
But I feel bad about not warning Nancy.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.747
You haven't told Peggy?

19:25.873 --> 19:28.333
No, because I don't wanna scare her.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.294
And you shouldn't wanna scare Nancy.

19:30.377 --> 19:31.420
I don't!

19:31.503 --> 19:34.256
Then just be cool. Everything is okay.

19:34.339 --> 19:38.051
Now, I'd like to get back to my family
and my chili taco.

19:41.388 --> 19:44.016
So you're telling me
the end of the world is near,

19:44.099 --> 19:46.852
and you're just gonna hang out
with your loved ones?

19:47.561 --> 19:48.896
And eat tacos?

19:48.979 --> 19:49.897
Yup.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.570
This train stops at the hotel.

19:56.653 --> 19:59.531
We can go back and order room service,
watch a movie.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.492
Or we could just get right to the sex,
whichever.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.746
Nancy!

20:08.790 --> 20:09.708
Dale?

20:09.833 --> 20:10.959
What are you doing here?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.377
Hello, John Redcorn.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.337
Dale.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.798
Nancy, I don't want us
to spend one more minute apart.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.009
I wanna be with you
for the rest of my life.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.012
So what if that's only 35 minutes away.

20:22.095 --> 20:25.390
Now, I'm not saying the world
is going to end in 35 minutes,

20:25.474 --> 20:29.394
but if it did, I know exactly
where I want to be.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.855
In the arms of my trusty wife.

20:31.939 --> 20:34.691
You are as beautiful as you are trusty.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.778
Now, let's go home.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.239
I want you in the bathroom
with me when it happens.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.323
What?

20:41.406 --> 20:42.407
Nancy...

20:43.242 --> 20:46.662
my lover, my teacher, my friend,

20:46.745 --> 20:49.915
I don't want to see me without you.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.834
Come on. Let's go!

20:52.918 --> 20:54.711
Hold that train, sir.

21:02.678 --> 21:04.471
I hope I made the right choice.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.974
Well, this is the only wig shop in Arlen,

21:07.057 --> 21:09.059
so you don't really have much choice.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.770
You're right, shug.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.149
<i>Oh, cold, hilarious fate!</i>
