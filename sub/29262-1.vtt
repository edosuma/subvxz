WEBVTT

04:25.899 --> 04:28.300
Don't panic. They're not
behind us.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.588
We did the right thing.
They're savages.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.918
This is it.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.354
Be careful.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.424
Please help me.
Please help me.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.928
No! No!

05:29.930 --> 05:31.897
This is the only way, my friend.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.365
I'm sorry.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.472
Easy, Mom.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.743
Hey, you gotta get some sleep.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.444
I wanna make sure
you stay awake.

06:19.446 --> 06:21.780
This is doing the trick.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.817
You could talk to me.
I'd like that.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.819
I don't really have anything.

06:27.821 --> 06:31.690
Come on, Jess. This move
came on really quickly,

06:31.692 --> 06:34.926
and I... I guess
I didn't give you a chance

06:34.928 --> 06:36.795
to express anything about it.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.563
That's on me.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.932
Decision's been made.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.468
There's nothing
I can really say now.

06:45.472 --> 06:48.607
The city was really expensive.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.675
And the salary
this guy's paying me

06:50.677 --> 06:53.912
is gonna feel like triple
in the community we're going to.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.514
He could be a creep.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.082
He's not a creep, Jesse.

06:57.084 --> 07:00.452
He's a man
with a debilitating disease.

07:00.454 --> 07:01.586
Still could be a creep.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.755
Stop that.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.092
These private home-nursing jobs
are tough to come by.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.428
And we're lucky I got it.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.463
And with us living
on his property,

07:11.465 --> 07:13.632
I couldn't ask
for a better commute.

07:13.634 --> 07:16.601
We'll have meals together.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.503
Real family time,

07:18.505 --> 07:20.439
instead of me working
such crazy hours,

07:20.441 --> 07:22.674
feeling like I haven't seen
you and your sister for days.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.944
It's a good thing,

07:25.946 --> 07:28.213
even if you can't see that now.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.889
Trying to get shot?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.958
I've made quite the trip
to see you.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.862
You still haven't
learned any manners, I see.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.964
Since you are up...

08:52.966 --> 08:56.801
let me show you what
has brought me all this way.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.180
Don't you recognize it?

09:09.182 --> 09:12.117
Only the tribal high priests
have opened this

09:12.119 --> 09:13.318
during the harvest.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.787
It is said...

09:15.789 --> 09:18.957
to look inside is to stare

09:18.959 --> 09:22.994
into the dark mirror
of your ancient's home.

09:24.331 --> 09:26.665
The Black Egg of Maa-Kalaratri.

09:26.667 --> 09:30.602
I know what it is.
I just don't believe it.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.737
It is my gift...

09:32.739 --> 09:34.139
for you...

09:34.975 --> 09:36.308
for your wife.

09:36.310 --> 09:39.244
You've always thought
that they...

09:39.246 --> 09:41.580
cursed her.

09:44.117 --> 09:49.888
She... was so very kind to me.

09:49.890 --> 09:55.894
And those savages poisoned
her... because of this!

09:55.896 --> 09:59.130
It wasn't poison.
It was malaria.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.801
No. I swore I would avenge her,
and I have kept my promise!

10:02.803 --> 10:06.237
When you seek revenge, you dig
two graves, one for yourself.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.874
I didn't dig graves.

10:09.876 --> 10:13.712
I left them above the Earth
for God to see.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.880
So, you've committed murder.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.882
How do you think she
would have felt about that?

10:17.884 --> 10:19.818
My customs are not yours.

10:21.054 --> 10:25.190
A gift of this magnitude
requires a trade.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.392
Something of meaning.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.194
A true sacrifice.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.796
Don't you talk to me
about sacrifice.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.399
She was my family, too.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.735
Go, leave, now.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.069
Leave.

10:38.071 --> 10:42.073
I've helped you find
many treasures.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.976
None more personal than this.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.949
You should obey the old ways.

10:50.951 --> 10:55.787
To touch the Black Egg without
an offering is very foolish.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.256
I've made my blood offering.

10:58.258 --> 10:59.791
Where's yours?

11:00.794 --> 11:03.395
I don't have your faith
in folklore.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.365
Then wisdom has eluded you.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.835
Enjoy your gift.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.931
Hmm.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.802
Well, we're here.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.970
Where is here?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.409
Door's a little sticky.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.950
Well, this is it.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.853
Our new home sweet home.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.354
It smells funny in here.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.490
Well, once we get it
cleaned up and settled in,

12:05.492 --> 12:08.226
it'll... it'll be great.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.795
Oh.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.106
Whoa.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.274
What are those
on the wall?

12:23.276 --> 12:24.776
I don't know.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.280
Looks like no one's been here
for a while.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.116
This is really dusty.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.917
I know, right?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.954
Look at these cracks
on the ceiling.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.293
- Have to go.
- What?

12:42.295 --> 12:44.496
Can you guys just start to bring
in whatever you can manage?

12:44.498 --> 12:46.064
Oh, come on.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.365
We were supposed
to be here hours ago.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.933
I need to check in at the house.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.769
- But all the stuff...
- You know what?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.470
Do the best you can, babe. Start
with the food and the bedding,

12:52.472 --> 12:55.240
and the rest
is just gonna have to wait.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.075
Come on.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.910
Come on, help me out here.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.411
I've been driving for days.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.213
I can do it!

13:02.215 --> 13:03.782
Thatta girl!

13:11.158 --> 13:13.091
Unbelievable.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.202
Door's open.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.539
Mr. Clark?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.908
Kara?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.077
Hi, there.

13:33.079 --> 13:35.079
- It's Kara.
- Kara!

13:35.081 --> 13:38.383
Oh, come here. Let me
take a look at you here. Hi.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.318
Hi. What is this,
a beauty pageant?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.320
Well, I was up late.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.822
Just playing catch-up here.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.390
OK, well, would you hand me?

13:45.392 --> 13:48.927
I'll show you
the lay of the land here.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.929
OK.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.999
If I was a horse, they
would have shot me years ago.

13:56.937 --> 14:01.406
Let's go to the grocery store
so we can buy some waffles.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.241
That's a good idea.

14:07.414 --> 14:11.049
Do you think
a ghost lives here?

14:11.852 --> 14:13.618
I don't think so.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.922
This is, uh, carbon-dated
to the time of Cleopatra.

14:17.924 --> 14:22.160
And these ceremonial masks
are from all over the world.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.496
Some of them are
as old as 500 BC.

14:25.498 --> 14:28.466
You're not big
on family photos, huh?

14:28.468 --> 14:33.404
You see, most of the human race
is all from the same tribe.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.051
I don't see a microwave,

14:47.053 --> 14:49.954
so you may just have to eat
one of these cold.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.460
Kitty cat!

14:58.265 --> 15:00.498
It's a stray.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.668
Get out of here!

15:03.670 --> 15:06.070
Be nice, Jesse.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.206
It's probably diseased.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.042
I hate it when you're mean.
It's just hungry.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.445
OK. Don't let it
back in the house.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.985
You're so fluffy.

15:20.987 --> 15:24.389
I'm gonna call you Mr. Whiskers.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.958
I like to listen to music,

15:26.960 --> 15:30.161
either jazz or classical.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.430
Helps me think.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.033
Too quiet in this house.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.602
It probably won't stay that way
with the kids.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.405
Ooh, ooh,
that reminds me.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.407
At night, I want this on.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.943
You feel like you're having
trouble, you just call out, OK?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.678
I'll have the other one
at my place.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.413
Ah, you give me a baby monitor?

15:48.415 --> 15:51.049
Think of it as an intercom.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.051
Oh, who's this?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.587
Tired. Need a nap.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.991
Mm, OK, you go ahead.
I have plenty to do.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.762
If there is a god
of this tribe...

17:12.398 --> 17:14.198
I curse it.

18:14.194 --> 18:15.194
Help me.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.361
Let her go!

18:17.363 --> 18:18.563
Come on, move!

18:28.374 --> 18:30.441
Oh, no.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.845
Uh, I'll clean this up.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.279
No, no, don't touch it.

18:35.281 --> 18:38.182
- I'll call the police.
- No!

18:38.184 --> 18:41.285
Just give me a... a minute.
I gotta think.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.354
That guy just broke in.

18:43.356 --> 18:46.257
Look, there are
a lot of things here

18:46.259 --> 18:47.658
that aren't technically legal.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.594
I don't want the police
coming in here,

18:49.596 --> 18:50.828
making an inventory.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.197
Who was that guy, huh?

18:53.199 --> 18:55.266
- Is he coming back?
- No, he won't be back.

18:55.268 --> 18:59.303
I'm terribly sorry.
You and your children are fine.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.606
It's a personal matter.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.241
It's over.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.511
- I'll get a broom.
- No, don't.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.379
I'll take care of it.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.654
Ah! Ah...

21:30.390 --> 21:33.791
Do you think Stevie
will find us here?

21:34.294 --> 21:36.394
What?

21:36.396 --> 21:40.865
We didn't tell him
that we were leaving New York.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.667
He knows.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.436
Good.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.339
Don't bring it up to Mom.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.675
Why not?

21:51.577 --> 21:53.978
Doesn't like talking about it.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.013
Why?

21:56.015 --> 21:58.449
Misses him, I guess.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.818
Do you miss him?

22:03.089 --> 22:04.822
Yeah.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.979
Hey, son.

25:14.981 --> 25:18.983
- What are you doing here?
- I...

25:18.985 --> 25:21.585
You're not supposed
to be in here.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.621
Yes, sir.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.523
Well, who invited you here?

25:25.525 --> 25:28.292
I thought my mom
might need this.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.694
Well, I...
She's at the pharmacy.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.830
I'll make sure she gets it.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.934
You know, curiosity
killed the cat.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.704
It can be deadly to people, too.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.241
Go on, go on.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.257
I did, I did.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.897
Sign this, Jane.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.234
Sheriff Dunne, please.

26:10.236 --> 26:14.204
Sheriff? That's
a little formal between us.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.639
I've known you
since junior high school

26:15.641 --> 26:18.576
Well, at work.
Gotta stay professional.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.879
All right, sheriff,
anything you say.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.581
Oh, you want your meds.
There you go.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.915
All right.
I was gonna keep 'em.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.017
- I'll see ya.
- See ya.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.352
May I help you?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.988
I'm here for
Walter Clark's scripts.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.057
Walter Clark, huh?

26:33.059 --> 26:34.224
You know him?

26:34.226 --> 26:36.927
Yeah, I know him.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.303
Here, kitty, kitty.

26:46.305 --> 26:50.975
I got some nice-tasting tuna
right there for you.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.177
I know you want it.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.082
Here, kitty cat!

27:02.054 --> 27:03.854
Kitty?

28:47.927 --> 28:49.293
No, no.

28:50.262 --> 28:51.495
No.

28:51.497 --> 28:53.263
No, no.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.500
No.

28:57.036 --> 28:58.902
No, no.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.872
No...

29:03.476 --> 29:05.476
No!

29:06.345 --> 29:08.345
No.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.380
No! Baby...

31:07.433 --> 31:09.266
What is it? What's wrong?

31:09.268 --> 31:11.168
Spider!

31:11.170 --> 31:12.336
Just a spider?

31:12.338 --> 31:14.037
It's big and ugly

31:14.039 --> 31:16.506
like one of those thanatulas.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.276
Tarantulas.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.879
And while they're ugly,
I don't think they're poisonous.

31:21.881 --> 31:24.314
It went behind that box.

31:27.887 --> 31:30.320
- This one?
- Mm-hm.

31:37.029 --> 31:38.662
Ha-ha! I got him!

31:41.033 --> 31:44.968
- What's wrong now?
- I didn't want you to kill him!

31:47.172 --> 31:51.909
Can I sleep
in your room tonight?

32:02.588 --> 32:05.389
What's that?

32:05.391 --> 32:07.224
Found it.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.159
You stole it.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.295
Did not.

32:11.297 --> 32:13.597
Found it at Walter's.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.533
So, you gonna give it back?

32:16.535 --> 32:19.569
With all the stuff he has,
he's not gonna miss it.

32:19.571 --> 32:23.206
That's called stealing.
It's not nice.

32:23.208 --> 32:26.009
It's still on his property.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.015
Oh, come on, don't be that way.

33:49.161 --> 33:50.794
- Mommy?
- Oh!

33:50.796 --> 33:54.131
Are you sleeping
in your brother's room, sweetie?

33:54.133 --> 33:57.067
The spider came by the window.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.069
Can I sleep with you?

33:59.071 --> 34:00.804
You're safe. Go to bed.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.809
It was big, like the kitty cat.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.612
You were just having
a bad dream.

34:08.614 --> 34:12.114
Here, let me tuck you in.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.150
You let your brother be.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.753
Will you check under my bed?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.755
You are fine.

34:20.559 --> 34:22.525
It was just a dream.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.804
I love you. Sweet dreams.

35:08.607 --> 35:10.340
Good night.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.778
I'm gonna go next door.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.414
You gonna be all right
on your own?

36:24.416 --> 36:26.850
Yeah, sure, whatever.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.420
All right. If you need anything,
just come get me.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.589
OK, bye.

36:44.670 --> 36:47.571
Wow, rebel without a cause.

36:47.573 --> 36:50.607
Huh? I'm here
to speak with you, sir.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.242
Well, come in, come in.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.914
Your, uh, mother
isn't here right now.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.783
She went into town.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.952
What do you want to talk about?

37:03.989 --> 37:05.622
I'm sorry.

37:05.991 --> 37:07.624
Oh.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.560
Mmm.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.931
Maybe I should call the sheriff.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.768
Do you even know what you took?

37:18.770 --> 37:21.404
- Yeah.
- What is it?

37:21.406 --> 37:24.274
It's a cool carving... thing.

37:24.276 --> 37:29.412
It's a part of a set
of African worshipers.

37:29.414 --> 37:33.683
Take one, and the rest
are worthless.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.987
And I suppose that, uh,
since you brought it back,

37:36.989 --> 37:40.023
I don't have to call
the authorities.

37:41.260 --> 37:42.525
Are you going to fire my mom?

37:42.527 --> 37:44.761
Is that why you took it?

37:44.763 --> 37:47.464
You want me to fire your mom?

37:49.001 --> 37:52.335
You can't go around taking
things that don't belong to you.

37:52.337 --> 37:53.970
Isn't that what you do?

37:53.972 --> 37:56.773
I mean...

37:56.775 --> 37:58.508
doesn't everything come
from somewhere else?

37:58.510 --> 38:03.513
Well, uh, each situation,
it's how you approach it.

38:03.515 --> 38:07.284
Whether you approach it
respectfully, honorably.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.819
If not, there
can be consequences

38:09.821 --> 38:13.657
for not just you
but your whole family.

38:13.659 --> 38:16.059
Your whole life sometimes.

38:16.862 --> 38:17.994
Trust me.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.929
What if I don't get caught?

38:20.766 --> 38:23.033
Well, you will get caught.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.335
You're not good enough.

38:25.337 --> 38:27.537
I suppose you
can't respect something

38:27.539 --> 38:29.639
that you don't understand.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.941
Hmm?

38:31.943 --> 38:34.811
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

38:36.014 --> 38:40.450
Unless, uh... you want me
to call the sheriff.

38:41.520 --> 38:43.053
Hmm?

38:49.995 --> 38:51.795
Here you go.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.424
Oh, honey,

39:21.426 --> 39:23.727
it's only spilled coffee.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.777
You OK?

39:40.779 --> 39:43.480
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...

39:43.482 --> 39:45.548
I lost it for a second.

39:51.823 --> 39:53.490
I don't mean to be rude,

39:53.492 --> 39:55.125
and I appreciate you
coming over here to check on me.

39:55.127 --> 39:58.628
But I was... I was hoping
to get a little alone time.

39:58.630 --> 40:02.065
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to barge in on you, but, um...

40:02.067 --> 40:04.701
something you want to tell me?

40:04.703 --> 40:06.536
Nope.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.571
Look, am I under arrest
or something?

40:08.573 --> 40:10.473
Only if you order
the chicken-fried steak.

40:10.475 --> 40:14.043
The meat is highly suspicious.

40:16.481 --> 40:21.017
No, I, um...
I have this thing where, um...

40:21.019 --> 40:23.853
when something's not right,
I feel it.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.657
So, help me out, OK?

40:29.461 --> 40:31.628
I don't know
what you want me to say.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.996
It's nothing.

40:36.468 --> 40:39.002
You know, I've, um...

40:39.004 --> 40:41.104
lived in this town
my whole life.

40:41.106 --> 40:45.141
And I know how to avoid
stepping on toes, trust me.

40:47.646 --> 40:49.479
What's going on?

40:51.950 --> 40:55.785
Uh, it's just...
It's just stress.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.688
Of a move.

40:58.690 --> 41:01.491
Trying to do what's best
for my kids.

41:03.028 --> 41:06.563
I thought coming here
would be a good idea.

41:06.565 --> 41:08.832
What's the father say?

41:10.735 --> 41:13.036
We, uh...
we tried to make it work.

41:13.038 --> 41:15.038
We really did.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.473
Uh, and we thought
having Cambria

41:16.475 --> 41:19.542
would bring us back
together.

41:19.544 --> 41:20.710
It didn't.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.645
I see.

41:22.647 --> 41:27.150
Nothing ever really worked out
the way I pictured, so...

41:27.152 --> 41:29.085
Well, I think people would say

41:29.087 --> 41:31.488
you're darn lucky
to have those kids.

41:31.490 --> 41:35.091
Yeah, lucky is
my middle name, all right.

41:38.964 --> 41:41.631
You know, when, um,
I hit a rough spot,

41:41.633 --> 41:45.268
and I was hitting up the bar
one too many nights a week.

41:45.270 --> 41:47.003
You know what I mean?

41:47.005 --> 41:48.238
Self-medicating.

41:49.674 --> 41:52.141
Well, when I finished
with all that, I realized

41:52.143 --> 41:53.810
that what I thought
were my troubles

41:53.812 --> 41:55.912
were actually my blessings.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.948
I just was too clouded
to see it.

41:59.818 --> 42:01.184
I'm seeing clearly.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.119
- Are you?
- Yeah.

42:03.121 --> 42:07.991
Your eyes are dilated,
and your hands are shaking.

42:09.528 --> 42:11.528
You're not fooling anyone.

42:16.301 --> 42:19.102
You, um...
you enjoy your alone time.

42:20.572 --> 42:22.005
I'll see you around.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.276
Hey, Joe, how you doing?

42:26.278 --> 42:27.810
Taking care.

42:27.812 --> 42:29.612
You take care.

42:29.614 --> 42:32.749
Looks like
a bunch of junk.

42:32.751 --> 42:34.117
You know, well,
one man's trash

42:34.119 --> 42:35.285
is another man's treasure.

42:35.287 --> 42:36.986
It's all how you look at it.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.188
There's no way
we're gonna fix it.

42:39.190 --> 42:41.758
Well, if you look at it all
at once, it might seem that way,

42:41.760 --> 42:44.627
but what you do is
you find one piece

42:44.629 --> 42:47.564
that fits with another,
gently put it together.

42:47.566 --> 42:50.700
And then find another and
another, and you go from there.

42:50.702 --> 42:53.269
Now, your job is to clean

42:53.271 --> 42:57.941
each piece of any debris
or tiny particles.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.009
Can you do that?

43:03.214 --> 43:05.715
Who's that?

43:05.717 --> 43:08.585
Mm, that's my wife, Maggie.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.286
We used to travel
the world together,

43:10.288 --> 43:14.624
but, uh, we always knew
we'd end up back here.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.160
Did she die?

43:18.096 --> 43:19.963
Yeah, she died.

43:20.765 --> 43:22.231
Sorry.

43:25.036 --> 43:26.336
She used to sit in that chair

43:26.338 --> 43:28.738
that you're sitting in
right now.

43:28.740 --> 43:32.642
But she never really liked
to sit very long. Hmm.

43:35.380 --> 43:38.114
What do these markings mean?

43:39.384 --> 43:41.284
You know what a legend is?

43:41.286 --> 43:44.020
Yeah, it's a story.

43:44.022 --> 43:45.655
Well, stories,
you tell in a bar.

43:45.657 --> 43:49.959
A legend has
a spiritual quality to it.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.328
Uh, it's ingrained in a culture

43:52.330 --> 43:56.232
by being passed down from
generation to generation.

43:56.234 --> 44:01.804
This particular legend
is Maa-Kalaratri.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.806
The Dark Mother.

44:03.808 --> 44:06.142
She's ancient...

44:06.144 --> 44:08.845
<i>before time was time,</i>

44:08.847 --> 44:11.714
<i>before humans existed.</i>

44:11.716 --> 44:16.285
<i>She is the spider goddess.</i>

44:16.287 --> 44:18.721
<i>A creator of worlds,</i>

44:19.758 --> 44:22.291
<i>a weaver of destiny.</i>

44:25.163 --> 44:26.796
<i>She presides over the time</i>

44:26.798 --> 44:30.266
<i>that we humans
are given on this earth.</i>

44:30.268 --> 44:34.971
<i>And she lives in the darkness
between the stars.</i>

44:37.709 --> 44:42.145
There was a time when the people
began to lose respect

44:42.147 --> 44:44.447
for the mother.

44:44.449 --> 44:49.986
<i>And so Maa-Kalaratri emerged
from a crack in the Earth,</i>

44:49.988 --> 44:52.288
<i>decimated the village</i>

44:52.290 --> 44:54.090
<i>destroyed the crops</i>

44:54.092 --> 44:57.760
<i>and stole a child
from the village's chief.</i>

44:57.762 --> 45:02.465
The people began to offer up
blood sacrifices to appease her.

45:02.467 --> 45:04.400
Sacrifices?

45:05.870 --> 45:07.970
I'll spare you the details.

45:49.280 --> 45:52.281
The people
believed that, if they obeyed

45:52.283 --> 45:56.486
<i>the sacrifice,
their crops would flourish,</i>

45:56.488 --> 45:58.321
<i>the village would thrive,</i>

45:58.323 --> 46:04.794
and they would be cradled
in the arms of the mother.

46:06.064 --> 46:11.134
So... out
of destruction and death,

46:11.136 --> 46:13.970
bubbles forth life.

46:15.974 --> 46:18.441
Do you believe all that?

46:18.443 --> 46:20.443
<i> Well...</i>

46:20.445 --> 46:22.445
<i>I've seen a lot of things
in this world</i>

46:22.447 --> 46:26.149
<i>that can't be explained
by science.</i>

46:26.151 --> 46:27.850
<i>People need to believe
in something,</i>

46:27.852 --> 46:30.286
<i>others, to blame.</i>

46:33.224 --> 46:36.125
<i>You believe in something
long enough</i>

46:36.127 --> 46:37.960
<i>and hard enough...</i>

46:39.430 --> 46:41.931
<i>...it becomes reality.</i>

46:42.300 --> 46:44.100
Kitty cat!

46:45.069 --> 46:46.536
But no...

46:46.538 --> 46:51.073
I don't believe
Maa-Kalaratri exists

46:51.075 --> 46:53.176
or has ever existed.

47:12.297 --> 47:14.230
Wow!

47:14.232 --> 47:15.998
Hmm.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.447
Jewels.

47:34.586 --> 47:36.919
They're all squishy.

47:44.062 --> 47:45.328
Kitty cat?

47:47.232 --> 47:49.265
Are you here?

47:51.035 --> 47:53.002
Hmm.

48:18.162 --> 48:20.963
Hello, what's your name?

48:20.965 --> 48:27.103
My name is Mr...

48:30.608 --> 48:33.342
...covered in this stuff.

48:34.379 --> 48:35.945
What is this?

48:35.947 --> 48:38.247
I hope he's not bothering you.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.949
No, he's helping me.

48:39.951 --> 48:42.385
Um, where's your sister?

48:42.387 --> 48:44.153
Watching cartoons.

48:44.155 --> 48:46.055
Well, go check on her please.

48:47.525 --> 48:49.125
Right now!

49:46.451 --> 49:48.284
Cambria?

49:49.320 --> 49:51.287
I'm not playing hide-and-seek.

49:55.526 --> 49:57.393
Mom!

49:58.997 --> 50:00.396
Mom!

50:06.404 --> 50:08.270
That light's bright.

50:08.272 --> 50:10.406
I know, just stay still, OK?

50:12.276 --> 50:14.210
My head hurts.

50:14.212 --> 50:17.279
Well, you bumped your head.
What were you doing?

50:17.281 --> 50:19.148
I was looking for kitty cat

50:19.150 --> 50:21.650
in the sticky snow
with the dolls.

50:21.652 --> 50:26.055
Mm, well, you rest.
I'll be close.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.297
I need you to make sure
she doesn't fall asleep.

50:35.299 --> 50:37.033
She's OK?

50:37.035 --> 50:38.601
Luckily, it looks like
only a mild concussion,

50:38.603 --> 50:40.403
but if she starts vomiting,
you come get me.

50:40.405 --> 50:41.670
I will.

50:41.672 --> 50:43.606
I mean it.

50:43.608 --> 50:45.374
Stay with her.

50:45.376 --> 50:47.276
Try to be
a little more responsible.

50:47.278 --> 50:49.078
This wasn't my fault.

50:50.548 --> 50:52.782
You left her alone.

50:52.784 --> 50:55.684
You have one job,
look out for your sister.

50:55.686 --> 50:58.120
It's easy for you to say.

50:58.122 --> 50:59.488
Excuse me?

50:59.490 --> 51:02.058
It's easy for you
to call it one job.

51:02.060 --> 51:04.727
But I make her breakfast,
lunch and dinner,

51:04.729 --> 51:08.464
dress her, get her to bed and
make sure she brushes her teeth.

51:08.466 --> 51:10.599
So that one job
that you've given me,

51:10.601 --> 51:12.234
it comes with a whole lot
of other things

51:12.236 --> 51:14.370
that you should be doing
but don't want to!

51:14.372 --> 51:17.673
I have done everything I can
for you and your sister.

51:17.675 --> 51:20.209
Always have. We moved here

51:20.211 --> 51:22.211
so that you two
could have better lives.

51:22.213 --> 51:23.579
So, don't you dare question

51:23.581 --> 51:25.081
my dedication
to you and your sister.

51:25.083 --> 51:26.849
We were fine in New York.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.218
We moved here
because you got fired!

51:29.220 --> 51:30.386
Watch your tone.

51:30.388 --> 51:32.221
Or what,
you'll ground me?

51:32.223 --> 51:34.123
Who will watch Cambria then?
Not you!

51:34.125 --> 51:35.858
Enough! Not another word.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.827
Just be responsible
and watch your sister.

51:37.829 --> 51:40.196
I know how to be responsible.

51:40.198 --> 51:42.264
I do it every day.

51:42.266 --> 51:45.601
Please watch your sister.

53:29.507 --> 53:31.707
I have the EpiPen, so let
me know if you start to feel

53:31.709 --> 53:34.410
- any flushing or irritation
- It's OK. It's fine, it's fine.

53:34.412 --> 53:35.811
Just go take care of your kids.

53:35.813 --> 53:37.580
Just check on
that little girl of yours.

53:37.582 --> 53:39.415
I just need to organize
your bathroom.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.717
No, no, no.
Leave that till the morning.

53:41.719 --> 53:44.720
I'll be out of your way
in just a minute.

53:46.657 --> 53:49.225
Looks like you're all set
for the morning.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.695
Oh, shit.

53:53.931 --> 53:54.931
What is that?

53:54.932 --> 53:55.998
Um, I was... I was...

53:56.000 --> 53:57.499
I was bringing these in for you.

53:57.501 --> 54:00.369
I haven't taken
those in a month.

54:00.371 --> 54:02.471
Well, they're for pain, so...

54:03.708 --> 54:05.407
Your pain or mine?

54:06.577 --> 54:07.943
What's that supposed to mean?

54:07.945 --> 54:10.846
Come on,
it's not what you think.

54:12.583 --> 54:15.251
I can see where your kids
get it from.

54:15.253 --> 54:17.353
Don't talk about my kids.

54:17.355 --> 54:19.355
You don't think
I know what I'm doing?

54:19.357 --> 54:22.925
I'm a nurse. I administer
medicine all day.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.527
- Just go.
- I drove across country

54:25.529 --> 54:27.429
to come and take care of you,
and that's what I'm doing.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.332
Look, you drove across country,
running from your problems.

54:30.334 --> 54:32.401
- It's your weak thinking.
- You can't judge me.

54:32.403 --> 54:35.971
Do you know what it's like
being stuck with two kids?

54:35.973 --> 54:39.408
<i>Doing it on your own? Doing
everything you can for them,</i>

54:39.410 --> 54:41.343
<i>and it never...</i>

54:42.346 --> 54:44.947
- It is all on me!
- Oh, poor you.

54:44.949 --> 54:47.783
You think people succeed
by not being responsible?

54:47.785 --> 54:49.885
I think that you sit up here,
boarded up away from life,

54:49.887 --> 54:51.587
one step away
from needing someone

54:51.589 --> 54:52.988
to wipe your ass for you.

54:52.990 --> 54:54.723
- Get out!
- Wait.

54:54.725 --> 54:56.992
- Get the hell out...
- I'm sorry.

54:56.994 --> 54:59.561
Your kids deserve
a better mother.

55:06.737 --> 55:09.705
Kara?

55:37.968 --> 55:41.103
You always saw
the best in people, didn't you?

55:43.441 --> 55:46.742
<i>Walls for the wind,
roof for the rain.</i>

55:46.744 --> 55:49.678
<i>Drinks beside the fire.</i>

55:49.680 --> 55:53.582
Laughter to cheer you,
loved ones to be near you.

55:53.584 --> 55:56.618
And all that your heart
may desire.

58:20.231 --> 58:22.197
Oh, Jesus.

59:28.299 --> 59:31.066
Look! Vanilla pancakes?

59:31.068 --> 59:32.834
That's right, your favorite.

59:32.836 --> 59:34.102
Trying to bribe us?

59:34.104 --> 59:36.305
It's breakfast,
not a scam.

59:36.307 --> 59:37.839
I want ketchup with my eggs.

59:37.841 --> 59:40.175
OK, ketchup and eggs
coming right up.

59:40.177 --> 59:41.710
Why aren't you at Walter's?

59:41.712 --> 59:43.879
Walter and I
aren't really meshing,

59:43.881 --> 59:47.049
so, um, I don't think
it's gonna work out.

59:47.051 --> 59:49.718
Doesn't make sense.
It's only been a few days.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.086
Well, better to cut ties now

59:51.088 --> 59:53.155
than months of trying
to get it right.

59:53.157 --> 59:56.658
I don't believe this.
What did you do?

59:56.660 --> 59:58.260
What did I do?

59:58.262 --> 01:00:00.629
Well, you did something,
just like every other time.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:02.297
You know what? I'm getting
really sick of your mouth.

01:00:02.299 --> 01:00:04.866
Are we going back to New York?

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.935
I think we should see
what opportunities

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:08.904
they have in town
for a qualified nurse.

01:00:08.906 --> 01:00:12.140
You're not doing this. I'm
not letting this happen again.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:17.913
- Is Jesse coming with us?
- Yes, of course he is.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:19.214
And my Misters?

01:00:19.216 --> 01:00:21.717
Yep, all of us.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:24.886
I'll be sure to let Stevie know.

01:00:32.396 --> 01:00:34.062
Walter?

01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:21.843
Ma'am?

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.749
Uh, ma'am...

01:01:27.751 --> 01:01:31.720
uh, I know that this is very
difficult for you right now,

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:36.958
but, um, I'm gonna need you
to come down to the station

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.428
and, uh, identify the body.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:40.796
Are you kidding me?

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:42.197
Uh, no, ma'am, please...

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.432
please calm... calm yourself.

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:45.133
What could have done that
to a person?

01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:46.802
- I don't know, I'm sorry.
- OK, OK.

01:01:46.804 --> 01:01:49.371
Let's just take it easy, OK?

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.174
Donny, why don't you
check upstairs, OK?

01:01:54.244 --> 01:01:56.445
Oh, OK, yeah,
I'll go check it out.

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.480
Good idea.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:02.017
I'm sorry about that. Um...

01:02:02.019 --> 01:02:04.086
What killed him?

01:02:04.088 --> 01:02:07.422
My kids need to be safe. What
could have done that to him?

01:02:07.424 --> 01:02:10.058
I honestly don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.029
And to do that, I need you
to start being honest with me.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:17.999
There was a break-in.

01:02:18.001 --> 01:02:19.468
What?

01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:21.303
The first day I was here,
some guy, he just...

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.438
He snuck in,
and he broke something.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.506
And he just ran out.

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.141
What did he look like?

01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:31.246
Um, he was, uh, six-three,
dark-skinned,

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:36.318
and he had these scars
on his face, like markings.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.487
Is that all of it?

01:02:40.824 --> 01:02:43.825
Sheriff, this is my fault
because I didn't say anything.

01:02:43.827 --> 01:02:47.496
Well, we'll see if that's
the case of not, won't we?

01:02:49.767 --> 01:02:51.333
We're gonna be here
a little longer,

01:02:51.335 --> 01:02:55.403
so, um, why don't you go home
and be with your kids?

01:03:04.181 --> 01:03:05.847
Let's go inside.

01:03:12.022 --> 01:03:13.922
Jesse...

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.472
Have a look around,

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:32.974
see if there's any, um,
evidence of a break-in,

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:36.311
and, um, let's dust for prints

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.513
on all the outside doors
and windows.

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.384
Oh, hey. Hey, you can't be here.

01:03:42.386 --> 01:03:44.419
I know what killed Walter.

01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:47.923
Give me a minute.

01:03:48.892 --> 01:03:50.559
Go ahead.

01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:52.027
It was a spider.

01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:54.462
What makes you say that?

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:58.533
Told me a story about a tribe
that worshiped a spider goddess.

01:03:58.535 --> 01:04:00.168
Said they believed it was real.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:03.071
Helped him put
the black egg back together,

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:05.106
then he died.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:08.109
It's an evil spirit,
and Walter was the sacrifice.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.414
You don't believe me.

01:04:13.617 --> 01:04:16.451
When you have eliminated
the impossible,

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:21.890
whatever remains, however
improbable, must be the truth.

01:04:21.892 --> 01:04:23.358
Do you know who said that?

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:25.894
Sherlock Holmes.

01:04:25.896 --> 01:04:28.163
He's the reason
I became a law officer.

01:04:28.165 --> 01:04:31.099
Solving crimes,
putting away the bad guys.

01:04:33.237 --> 01:04:35.003
How you doing?

01:04:38.342 --> 01:04:40.909
You know, Holmes had
his Dr. Watson.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:43.278
And I don't have a Dr. Watson.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.015
And I need all the help I
can to figure this one out.

01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:48.250
I can do that.

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.018
Great.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:52.354
So if you have any evidence,
any hard evidence,

01:04:52.356 --> 01:04:55.257
any... anything
that backs that story up,

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.092
you bring it straight to me.

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:59.160
I will.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:01.463
I got your back.
I'm keeping an eye on you

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.465
and your sister and your mom.

01:05:03.467 --> 01:05:07.636
OK? I'm gonna find the truth
about what happened.

01:05:07.638 --> 01:05:09.905
Thank you.

01:05:09.907 --> 01:05:12.207
Oh...

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:13.942
It's OK.

01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:16.678
It will be OK.

01:05:20.117 --> 01:05:21.316
All right.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.466
So, I was thinking
it might be nice

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.735
to hold a little ceremony
for Walter this weekend.

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:16.071
Like a party?

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.472
Sort of.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.675
When people go away,

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.310
it's custom
to hold a celebration

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:25.013
of the time you had with them.

01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:27.449
Maybe you want to wear
your pretty white dress?

01:06:27.451 --> 01:06:29.451
And my fairy wings?

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:31.052
Sure, babe.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:33.221
I think Walter would like that.

01:06:33.223 --> 01:06:35.457
And you have that nice shirt
we got you...

01:06:35.459 --> 01:06:37.492
Maa-Kalaratri killed him.

01:06:37.494 --> 01:06:39.694
Who's Maa-Kala-party?

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.629
Your brother doesn't know
what he's talking about.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.732
Just like the one
the tribe believed in.

01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.100
Stop it, Jesse.

01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.468
I'm telling you,
it was a spider.

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:48.036
A spider?!

01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:49.604
You're scaring your sister.
Stop this!

01:06:49.606 --> 01:06:51.606
I saw a spider.

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:54.209
Walter was just telling stories.

01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:55.777
He didn't mean
that any of it was real.

01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:57.579
It comes and sucks blood.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:59.481
Enough!

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.117
It feeds on sacrifices.
It could get us. It's real!

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:03.718
Stop it, Jesse!

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.220
Cambria!

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:07.255
Why would you do that?

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:09.124
'Cause you won't listen to me.

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:11.726
Or does one of us have to die,
just like Stevie.

01:08:31.341 --> 01:08:32.674
Cambria?

01:09:24.895 --> 01:09:27.295
Check on the kids.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.880
Cambria?

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.458
Jesse? Cambria?

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.490
No! Baby...

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.320
Kids?

01:11:27.851 --> 01:11:29.050
Jesse.

01:11:30.854 --> 01:11:33.388
Shhh.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:02.410
Get behind me.

01:14:25.195 --> 01:14:26.894
Mom!

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:28.930
- Mommy!
- Mom!

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:31.232
Mom.

01:14:35.138 --> 01:14:37.738
Oh...

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:47.582
Get out! Go! Go!

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:58.793
Mom! Mom!

01:15:14.511 --> 01:15:18.212
Mom! Mom!

01:15:18.214 --> 01:15:21.282
Mom! Mom!

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:23.117
- Mommy!
- Oh, no.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.921
Mom!

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:33.127
- Mom! Mom!
- Mom! Mom!

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.229
Mommy!

01:15:44.073 --> 01:15:46.307
I'm really scared.

01:15:46.309 --> 01:15:50.545
Jesse... downstairs.

01:15:50.547 --> 01:15:53.281
- Phone.
- I'll be right back.

01:16:03.293 --> 01:16:05.092
Come here.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.734
I want Mr. Giraffe.

01:16:22.145 --> 01:16:25.079
Call the coroner
and get him out here.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.114
- Will do.
- And get in touch with the CDC.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:31.352
They might need
to send someone out here.

01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:37.024
Kara?

01:16:37.026 --> 01:16:38.893
<i> Sheriff, come quick.</i>
<i>My mom's turning into a spi...</i>

01:16:38.895 --> 01:16:40.328
Jesse?

01:16:41.264 --> 01:16:43.197
Jesse!

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.933
Get all available units out
to the Gillette place.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.902
Send an ambulance out that way.

01:16:57.380 --> 01:17:00.081
Get...

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.215
medical bag.

01:17:01.217 --> 01:17:03.951
Here. Take this.

01:17:13.796 --> 01:17:18.799
Don't worry, Mommy.
Mr. Giraffe will protect us.

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.740
Bring her to me.

01:19:06.809 --> 01:19:08.309
Jesse.

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:10.144
Jesse, give me your shirt.

01:19:12.515 --> 01:19:14.782
Sweetie, hey.

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:16.417
Hey, I'm here, OK?

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:18.319
Mommy's here.

01:19:20.389 --> 01:19:22.356
I need you to be brave.

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:26.227
Ow.

01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:28.129
Looks like it
went clean through.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:34.201
It tried to eat me.

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:36.971
I know.
Mommy's gonna make it go away.

01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:38.906
Mommy's gonna make it better.

01:19:38.908 --> 01:19:40.975
It's OK.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:55.990
I need you to get
your sister out of here.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:00.294
She needs you
to do this for her.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.264
I need you...
to do this for her.

01:20:03.266 --> 01:20:08.169
You go with your brother,
and you do what he says.

01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:12.072
It's OK. The doctor's
gonna come here, too.

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:15.075
And he's gonna
take care of Mommy.

01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:17.344
Right?

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:19.980
She'll be fine. We have to go.

01:20:21.851 --> 01:20:23.083
Yeah.

01:20:38.434 --> 01:20:41.001
I love you, Mommy.

01:21:28.351 --> 01:21:30.217
It's stuck.

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.920
The door's stuck.

01:21:43.199 --> 01:21:44.632
Come on.

01:21:59.282 --> 01:22:01.916
Jesse! Jesse!

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:06.921
I think there's something
in the chimney.

01:22:23.606 --> 01:22:25.239
Stay here.

01:23:44.653 --> 01:23:46.687
No!

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:49.750
Ste...

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.860
Stevie.

01:25:08.871 --> 01:25:11.772
I'm sorry.

01:25:13.409 --> 01:25:14.775
Kara.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:18.212
Kara, stay with me,
stay with me.

01:25:18.214 --> 01:25:19.746
It's all right.

01:25:19.748 --> 01:25:22.116
Mommy.

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:24.651
Mommy!

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:28.155
All right, Kara.
Kara, it's OK.

01:25:29.859 --> 01:25:32.426
You're safe now.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.571
You're OK.
Just stay with me here.

01:25:44.573 --> 01:25:46.340
Mommy!

01:25:46.342 --> 01:25:49.243
- That's it.
- Mommy!

01:25:50.846 --> 01:25:54.381
It's OK.

01:26:16.372 --> 01:26:18.639
Jesse.

01:26:25.548 --> 01:26:28.182
I love you.

01:26:30.186 --> 01:26:32.786
I love you.

01:26:35.591 --> 01:26:37.958
I love you.

01:27:51.767 --> 01:27:56.270
You think Stevie
will know we're leaving?

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.743
He'll know.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.581
<i>Because no matter what happens,</i>

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:09.916
<i>no matter where we live,</i>

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:12.286
<i>we'll always be a family.</i>

01:34:09.845 --> 01:34:13.213
Ahhh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh!

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.049
What's up, man?

01:34:17.352 --> 01:34:18.952
You OK?

01:34:18.954 --> 01:34:21.087
Yeah.

01:34:26.395 --> 01:34:30.063
Are you afraid of a few
little spiders?
