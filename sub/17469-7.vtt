You wanna hear something

"Graffiti is a twilight means

00:34.868 --> 00:37.678
...between the anonymous man
and the world."

00:37.837 --> 00:40.283
- Wow.
- Yeah.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.477
Who wrote that?

00:42.776 --> 00:46.223
A guy named Robert Reisner.

Me too, honey.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.610
- You're different.
- What?

02:21.774 --> 02:23.720
No. Heh.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.723
Just, uh, same old Cindy.

02:46.299 --> 02:49.143
Hey, whip up some of those
butter pastrami sandwiches...

02:49.302 --> 02:51.282
...for poker tonight, will you?

02:53.306 --> 02:54.876
Yep.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.384
- Morning, Daddy.
- Morning, sweetheart.

04:04.544 --> 04:08.014
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up
a birthday card for a friend.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.819
Oh. may I?

04:10.583 --> 04:12.256
Later.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.558
So, what did you wanna talk
to me about?

04:18.491 --> 04:20.596
Are you getting eight hours?

04:21.961 --> 04:23.770
We just closed an issue.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.935
Sam and I have had a few late sessions,
but I'll make up for them.

04:28.968 --> 04:32.973
Now that you and Chad are broken up,
what about a job somewhere else?

04:33.940 --> 04:37.114
I've got a lead on a great position
at a white-shoe law firm.

04:38.311 --> 04:39.619
With more suitable men.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.988
<i>News of the Week's changed.</i>

04:42.148 --> 04:44.355
They're putting black murderers
on the cover.

04:44.517 --> 04:47.157
- It's not what we signed up for.
- That was one cover.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.658
Mudge Rose Guthrie will put
your talents to good use.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.563
They have
a rigorous Research Department.

04:51.724 --> 04:52.930
Mudge Rose?

04:54.927 --> 04:56.201
You already set this up.

04:58.364 --> 05:01.402
I bumped into Randolph Guthrie.
We had a conversation.

05:01.567 --> 05:04.707
- Daddy--
- All I ask is that you meet us for dinner.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.179
Just a meal. Nothing formal.

05:06.339 --> 05:09.718
If you don't like what Randolph has to say,
that's the end of it.

05:10.777 --> 05:12.051
<i>Okay-</i>

05:12.211 --> 05:14.953
He'll love you. How could he not?

05:23.823 --> 05:25.700
Well, it's foxy.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.236
- I'm just not sure it's allowed.
- Of course it is.

05:28.394 --> 05:32.171
Charlotte Reid wore pants
on the floor of the Senate in December.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.211
- Hm.
- Don't you think it's professional?

05:36.536 --> 05:39.676
- Absolutely.
- Good, because I am 25 today...

05:39.839 --> 05:42.445
...and I am going to start
taking myself more seriously.

05:42.608 --> 05:43.916
Hm.

05:44.744 --> 05:48.157
That thing at the Chelsea
was kind of a wake-up call.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.250
For all of us.

05:50.416 --> 05:53.192
Think you could pick up beer
before you come over tonight?

05:53.353 --> 05:55.230
I'm not sure if I got enough.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.528
You really wanna have a dinner party
for your 25th birthday?

05:58.691 --> 06:01.604
Yes. It feels grown-up.
Nora's making a duck mousse.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.475
I can think of a few other grown-up ways
to celebrate.

06:06.632 --> 06:08.578
- After.
- Mmm.

06:13.106 --> 06:14.676
Oh, there it is again.

06:15.608 --> 06:18.111
Novo 22. Guy's prolific.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.757
The cop I talked to said
these guys are hard to catch.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.723
They do it after school
when tunnels are jammed, or at night.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.797
Maybe your article will help
to put him behind bars.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.958
I hope not. I'm rooting for him.

06:31.824 --> 06:34.464
I may have defaced
a building or two in my time.

06:34.627 --> 06:35.935
What?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.598
Yeah, a black coffee and a bear claw.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.000
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.202
Thank you.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.372
Hey, I gotta go. Where are
the girls taking you for breakfast?

06:45.538 --> 06:48.485
I don't know. Just some hole in the wall
that Cindy found.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.216
It's your birthday. Enjoy it.

06:58.684 --> 07:01.961
A warm welcome
to the new faces this morning.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.226
Denise, Laura, June.

07:04.390 --> 07:06.392
I know everyone's very grateful
you're here.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.061
Nice pantsuit.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.104
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.571
That makes 13.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.642
Not bad.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.973
How are we doing
on the men's salaries?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.479
- How'd you get past Angie?
- When did you get those?

07:19.138 --> 07:22.017
I snuck into Finn's office
on Saturday night after I saw you.

07:23.042 --> 07:24.453
She's a regular Mata Hari.

07:28.781 --> 07:32.991
These numbers are going
to make you feel things.

07:33.419 --> 07:35.456
But you go right ahead
and feel them, okay?

07:35.621 --> 07:37.498
It's a part of it.

07:39.258 --> 07:42.705
"Benjamin Collingsworth,
hired in 1967...

07:43.496 --> 07:46.136
...$20,000 a year.

07:46.299 --> 07:50.372
Gabriel Greenstone, 1969, 17,000.

07:50.536 --> 07:54.109
Douglas Rhodes, 1968, 21,000.

07:54.273 --> 07:57.379
Samuel Rosenberg, 1968...

07:57.543 --> 07:59.819
...$20,000 a year."

08:00.446 --> 08:04.019
- Imagine what we could do with that.
- I wouldn't have to live with my mother.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.824
I knew that Doug made more,
but $21 ,OOO is three times what I make.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.365
- And we work just as many hours.
- More.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.566
Injustice hurts, doesn't it?

08:14.060 --> 08:18.509
It should. It's your evidence
that something is wrong. Don't ignore it.

08:19.065 --> 08:22.046
We are too close
to be seduced by a raise...

08:22.201 --> 08:25.205
...or a juicy story,
or some fun in the sack.

08:26.706 --> 08:29.812
I mean it, ladies.
You cannot be sleeping with the enemy.

08:29.976 --> 08:31.683
No reporters. No editors.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.051
What does that have to do
with anything?

08:35.648 --> 08:38.424
It can be used to discredit you
in a court of law.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.861
- But what if they're our boyfriends?
- Well, once we file this complaint...

08:42.488 --> 08:46.630
...every job that's given to one of you
is one that's taken from one of them.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.863
They're gonna hate us.

08:50.463 --> 08:52.409
They probably will.

08:53.332 --> 08:56.438
But we are putting the world on notice.

08:57.103 --> 09:02.075
Women will not tolerate being
second-class citizens anymore.

09:02.475 --> 09:03.920
<i>Not at News of the Week...</i>

09:04.410 --> 09:06.151
...or the post office...

09:06.312 --> 09:08.087
...or the bank.

09:08.247 --> 09:11.251
There will be blood spilled, women.

09:11.417 --> 09:14.193
This is war.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.563
- Cindy.
- Yeah.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.105
Do you know
what happened to Mata Hari?

09:24.263 --> 09:25.799
Um...

09:25.965 --> 09:27.672
She was shot.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.335
They found her out.

09:29.502 --> 09:33.450
Look, stealing the salaries
may have been necessary...

09:33.606 --> 09:35.142
-...but it was dangerous.
- Yeah.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.481
And we're too close
to start feeling powerful.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.384
That's what causes us to make mistakes.

09:42.148 --> 09:43.684
Yeah.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.820
_OkflY-
_OkflY-

10:00.666 --> 10:03.169
- Morning.
- Morning.

10:04.303 --> 10:06.283
Where is everyone?

10:06.439 --> 10:09.079
I think the two of us can put out
the magazine this week.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.585
I'll start sharpening my pencils.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.125
Hello.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.828
It's stuck. I can't get it out.

10:27.994 --> 10:30.998
- It's 10 o'clock.
- It's Monday.

10:31.664 --> 10:35.009
- Start time's 9:30.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.773
A few of us met up with Patti
for her birthday.

10:38.604 --> 10:40.845
Well, it was just coffee and doughnuts...

10:41.007 --> 10:44.511
...but I'm having a dinner party tonight.
I'd love it if you could be there.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.453
Thank you,
but I have a prior engagement.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.862
Oh, thank God.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.835
Are you finished with that?

10:58.991 --> 11:02.632
- Yeah. I was just copying this for Ned.
- Lucky you.

11:32.892 --> 11:34.929
Yeah, that's a good idea.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.405
Ha-ha-ha!
- Hey.

11:44.804 --> 11:45.839
He's in the alley.

11:46.238 --> 11:47.478
Oh.

11:47.640 --> 11:49.278
Oh, yeah. I just needed to--

11:50.810 --> 11:51.948
Um...

11:55.314 --> 11:57.225
Thank you.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.735
Hello.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.176
Hey.

12:13.332 --> 12:16.870
- What are you doing out here?
- This is where I do my thinking.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.481
Oh!

12:19.004 --> 12:20.540
And occasionally catch criminals.

12:21.006 --> 12:22.110
Oh.

12:22.274 --> 12:25.118
Well, as a criminal myself...

12:25.544 --> 12:29.492
...I can see how this would be
a good place to hide evidence.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.129
That sounds like an admission.

12:34.553 --> 12:35.623
Maybe it is.

12:38.157 --> 12:40.694
I'm gonna have to ask you
to turn around.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.446
Hands up.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.658
Can I search you?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.279
Excuse me, miss. What are these?

13:55.134 --> 13:56.909
"Too controversial."

13:57.069 --> 14:00.073
Who the hell do they think they are,
dictating the stories I run?

14:00.239 --> 14:02.446
Cheer up. You used to love making
the money guys squirm.

14:02.608 --> 14:05.248
- Back in the day, that was the point.
- That was eons ago.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.119
Now I spend half my day
blowing advertisers.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.489
This is not what I thought
I'd be doing with my life.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.993
When's the last time you had any fun?

14:15.154 --> 14:18.658
Fun? Years. Decades. I don't know.

14:19.959 --> 14:24.169
One of Jann's investors is having
a little shindig out at Long Island tonight.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.140
We should go. Drive out there,
make a day of it, you know?

14:27.299 --> 14:30.178
- It'll be like old times.
- I've got a magazine to run.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.216
Not if you don't start schmoozing
the money guys.

14:34.373 --> 14:37.650
Look, Doug's working on graffiti,
Sam's doing the vet piece.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.952
It's gonna be a solid issue.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.922
There's nothing for you to do
but look over their shoulders.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.661
- Listen to him, Finn.
- Excuse me?

14:45.818 --> 14:47.092
Thank you, Angie.

14:47.553 --> 14:51.057
If there were ever a day to play hooky,
this is it.

14:53.092 --> 14:54.196
I don't schmooze.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.239
You don't have to do anything
but stand next to me and be pretty.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.398
From now on,
I'll handle all these assholes.

14:59.698 --> 15:01.644
And all I have to do is go to a party?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.541
I will hold down the fort.

15:06.505 --> 15:08.576
You were a great goddamn hire,
you know that?

15:12.344 --> 15:14.221
You too.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.429
Nixon's planning
to cut Veteran services.

15:22.788 --> 15:24.961
I can't believe you read the Journal
before I do.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.502
Breakfast with Daddy.
He's my researcher.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.800
Well, maybe it makes sense,
cutting services.

15:33.565 --> 15:36.637
Look, it says here,
none of the hospitals are at capacity.

15:36.802 --> 15:39.180
There just isn't as much need
as people think.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.980
I'm seeing Noah tonight. I'll get his take.

15:43.142 --> 15:45.622
And maybe we'll go to Patti's after,
if he's up to it.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.593
- You going?
- I have a family dinner.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.002
Patti.

16:14.239 --> 16:18.016
I just did it with Ned.

16:18.177 --> 16:19.747
Again.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.553
And I know what Eleanor said, but I--

16:24.416 --> 16:26.396
I don't know how to stop.

16:27.252 --> 16:28.959
And that is, um, ahem--

16:29.121 --> 16:32.102
That is two different men
that I have had sex with today...

16:32.257 --> 16:34.601
...if you were counting.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.736
But I did shower in between, so...

16:38.497 --> 16:40.875
Can I ask you something?

16:43.302 --> 16:45.179
Do you have to...

16:45.337 --> 16:46.577
...with Lenny?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.386
Oh. Well, he's my husband.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.549
Have you thought about leaving him?

16:59.752 --> 17:02.596
I wouldn't know how.

17:07.291 --> 17:10.704
Well, Doug and I got back together.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.974
What, like, "together" together?

17:14.133 --> 17:16.409
It felt like it.

17:17.736 --> 17:20.182
That is wonderful, Patti.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.682
Is it?

17:22.441 --> 17:24.182
Eleanor.

17:27.780 --> 17:31.250
Oh, right. Stop talking as soon I appear.
Very decent of you.

17:31.417 --> 17:34.091
Oh, no, no. We-- We were--

17:34.853 --> 17:37.094
We were just leaving.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.296
- Is everything okay?
- Mm-hm.

17:41.360 --> 17:45.137
Hey, why don't you come by tonight
after your thing?

17:45.297 --> 17:47.868
You should. It'll be fun.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.821
According to Rapid Transit...

18:08.987 --> 18:12.025
...the Sharpie has been
the vandals' preferred tool...

18:12.191 --> 18:14.967
...since it was invented in '64.

18:15.794 --> 18:17.740
Well, spray paint's gotta be catching up.

18:17.896 --> 18:23.244
Between the two of them, they cost
the city $500,000 to clean up last year.

18:23.402 --> 18:24.904
I wanna know why they do it.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.114
Why risk getting caught and--? And--?

18:28.774 --> 18:31.448
And messing everything up for yourself?

18:32.377 --> 18:35.221
Just so the world can see
your name on a wall?

18:35.914 --> 18:37.291
Why did you do it?

18:39.051 --> 18:41.190
I don't know. Heh.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.928
Maybe just to tick off my old man.

18:47.392 --> 18:49.565
I painted "Bad Dog"
on our garage one night.

18:49.728 --> 18:53.266
- Why "bad dog"? Oh.
- That's what I called myself. Bad dog.

18:54.199 --> 18:59.512
Well, maybe your meeting at the Transit
Authority can lead you to Novo 22.

18:59.671 --> 19:01.947
- Shit.
- And then you two can compare notes.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.720
So I'll see you tonight, Bad Dog?

19:06.645 --> 19:08.056
- Ruff!
- Grrr!

19:08.547 --> 19:10.493
Douglas Rhodes.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.887
No kidding? Thank you.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.562
Yeah, I'd be happy to.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.466
Tonight?

19:23.862 --> 19:26.934
A Corvette Stingray?
And Chevrolet went for this?

19:27.099 --> 19:31.070
Well, I take offense at the implication.
It's an honest test drive.

19:31.737 --> 19:34.217
Head down. I'll meet you out front.

19:38.210 --> 19:41.384
You're the first woman
to wear pants in this office.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.658
- It's your birthday. I'll let it slide.
- How did you know it was my birthday?

19:48.820 --> 19:49.924
Angie knows everything.

19:50.322 --> 19:51.562
Oh.

19:51.890 --> 19:54.598
So, what's it feel like being 25?

19:55.994 --> 19:58.600
I feel old for the first time.

19:58.764 --> 20:02.234
Here's some perspective. By your age,
Michelangelo had sculpted the Pieté.

20:02.401 --> 20:05.405
Orson Welles made Citizen Kane.
Keats was dead.

20:05.571 --> 20:08.711
- I made coffee this morning. A whole pot.
- All by yourself?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.217
- All by myself.
- Very good.

20:10.809 --> 20:13.881
Look, I spent my 25th
drawing up that list, so I know.

20:14.046 --> 20:18.358
About the same time that I realized
there was a clock ticking on my life.

20:18.850 --> 20:21.057
I first noticed mine
my senior year at Vassar...

20:21.220 --> 20:24.394
...when every girl I knew
was getting engaged.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.399
Every girl but Patti Robinson.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.094
Right.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.200
I think there might
be something wrong with me.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.706
It's possible.

20:34.533 --> 20:35.978
It would be so much easier.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.073
It would be.

20:41.106 --> 20:43.985
But easy doesn't get you the Pieté.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.389
- We're talking pantsuits tomorrow.
- Okay.

20:51.149 --> 20:53.356
All right, where is she?

20:53.518 --> 20:55.691
- Aha!
- Oh. Ha-ha!

20:55.854 --> 20:59.768
- What'd I tell you?
- Holy crap, she's a cherry.

21:00.325 --> 21:03.204
Think she's sexy enough to make
the public forget about Ralph Nader?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.638
He said they cut corners
on safety in the Corvair.

21:05.797 --> 21:08.607
If that's true,
Chevy got what they deserved.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.948
- Wait. No.
- Yes.

21:13.739 --> 21:15.650
Lydia starts driving three years from now.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.949
I'm never gonna sleep again.

21:18.110 --> 21:21.319
Nothing like a little bad press
to make a company do the right thing.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.824
Okay. Agh!

21:25.651 --> 21:27.062
All right, gentlemen...

21:27.219 --> 21:30.462
...start your engines.

22:24.343 --> 22:27.722
I didn't know
my little mouse could be so ravishing.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.085
Thought it was just dinner
at some girl's apartment.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.389
Yeah, it's Patti's.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.861
It's her 25th birthday...

22:37.022 --> 22:39.400
...so a bunch of people from work
will be there.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.498
So you're wearing a dirty little get-up?

22:45.964 --> 22:48.376
It's just a dress, Lenny.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.809
Take it off.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.384
No.

23:12.691 --> 23:15.695
Now, where's my sports coat?

23:16.828 --> 23:19.968
But you don't need a sports coat...

23:20.599 --> 23:22.203
...for poker.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.791
If I never see Gabe Greenstone again...

23:37.949 --> 23:39.986
...it'll be too soon.

23:40.385 --> 23:43.161
Leaving that magazine was
the best move I ever made.

23:43.321 --> 23:45.824
Yesterday I covered a homicide
on the Upper West Side.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.629
You don't need experience for that?

23:47.793 --> 23:50.501
My last article was about
a pair of seals refusing to mate.

23:50.662 --> 23:53.268
The Post trusts me
on relationships gone sour.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.638
Huh.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.404
<i>Hows News of the Week?</i>

23:56.568 --> 23:59.811
Doug and I just had
our second cover in a month.

23:59.971 --> 24:01.678
Good for Doug.

24:03.508 --> 24:05.749
What's the latest on the EEOC thing?

24:05.911 --> 24:09.085
Well, as of today we're no longer allowed
to sleep with reporters...

24:09.247 --> 24:11.955
...for credibility reasons, and...

24:12.551 --> 24:15.589
...Doug and I just got back together,
kind of.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.829
Have you told him?

24:19.257 --> 24:20.964
Mm-mm.

24:21.259 --> 24:24.206
I just can't believe that losing Doug
is what it's gonna take...

24:24.362 --> 24:26.842
...for me to become a writer.

24:27.699 --> 24:30.407
I didn't break up with Doug
and I'm a writer.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.514
Writing makes you a writer.

24:33.672 --> 24:35.310
This complaint's important...

24:35.474 --> 24:37.852
...but what happens
when they start hiring women?

24:38.009 --> 24:39.044
I get to write.

24:39.578 --> 24:43.492
- Or they hire two or three to fill their quota.
- That's so cynical.

24:44.049 --> 24:45.722
Hopefully.

24:45.884 --> 24:47.386
But if I were you...

24:47.552 --> 24:50.465
...I'd knock out a great sample
so that they know you can write.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.193
Besides, if it's good,
I'll give it to my editor at the Post.

24:53.358 --> 24:55.360
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

24:55.527 --> 24:58.633
We need to make sure nobody steals
your opportunity out from under you.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.816
Whoa!

25:11.109 --> 25:13.089
<i>Whoa-hon!</i>

25:15.080 --> 25:16.650
What'd I tell you, huh?

25:16.815 --> 25:19.853
Oh, man. You weren't kidding.

25:24.256 --> 25:26.668
Whoa! Ha-ha-ha!

25:32.264 --> 25:33.868
How's Talia?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.540
When's the last time we were
all together? Was that Cape Cod?

25:40.038 --> 25:41.676
Can that have been two years ago?

25:42.707 --> 25:44.709
Remember Bonnie
and Talia's clambake?

25:47.312 --> 25:49.417
They damn near torched the town.

25:49.915 --> 25:53.692
Yes, they did, but dinner,
dinner was cooked perfectly.

25:57.155 --> 25:59.431
That was a really fun summer.

26:00.191 --> 26:02.068
Yes, it was.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.366
Yes, it was.

26:09.501 --> 26:10.809
Hey!

26:11.269 --> 26:13.442
- You coming?
- Yeah.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.719
Wherever the road may lead.

26:33.825 --> 26:35.771
Hi, gorgeous.

26:37.128 --> 26:38.766
Hi.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.235
What are you doing down here?

26:42.367 --> 26:43.903
Just waiting on a buddy.

26:44.069 --> 26:46.572
We're going to see a new band
at the Fillmore later.

26:46.905 --> 26:48.111
The Allman Brothers.

26:48.640 --> 26:51.177
- Ever hear of them?
- Mm-mm.

26:51.343 --> 26:54.722
Kind of a southern, bluesy rock.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.517
You'd like them.

26:56.681 --> 26:57.819
How do you know that?

26:59.017 --> 27:01.361
I'm guessing.

27:02.487 --> 27:03.932
You have good taste.

27:15.467 --> 27:18.448
I, uh, knocked on your door last night.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.114
- I've been avoiding you.
- Oh!

27:25.276 --> 27:26.311
Honesty.

27:28.013 --> 27:29.686
I like that.

27:31.116 --> 27:32.424
Damn.

27:32.584 --> 27:34.222
I guess that means that...

27:34.386 --> 27:37.196
...New Year's wasn't as good for you
as it was for me. Huh?

27:37.355 --> 27:40.893
Max, I wanna thank you so much
for being such a gentleman that night.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.732
You are certainly are welcome, Jane.

27:42.894 --> 27:45.807
If you could just write a thank-you note
on fancy stationery...

27:45.964 --> 27:48.171
...I would be much obliged.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.574
Ha-ha. Okay, you.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.046
How are you doing?

27:58.576 --> 28:01.455
I feel like I'm in a strange land.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.919
I was saving myself for marriage.

28:06.084 --> 28:09.429
Ah, but you changed your mind.

28:09.587 --> 28:10.691
I did.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.568
Well...

28:15.126 --> 28:16.161
...I was honored.

28:18.496 --> 28:21.102
And, you know,
things don't have to be funky.

28:21.266 --> 28:24.839
You know, you don't have to avoid me.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.773
<i>Okay-</i>

28:26.938 --> 28:28.474
Good.

28:29.908 --> 28:33.185
And I think the next time that I, um...

28:34.145 --> 28:36.557
-...you know...
- Mm-hm.

28:37.749 --> 28:39.592
...I think I wanna be in love.

28:40.685 --> 28:42.562
Yeah, it's...

28:43.321 --> 28:45.597
It's nice that way too.

28:50.662 --> 28:54.576
Now, you're sure you don't wanna
go check out the Allman Brothers?

28:55.333 --> 28:56.778
Not for me.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.118
- Uh, Jane.
- Mm-hm?

29:06.644 --> 29:08.055
You're a cool woman.

29:12.350 --> 29:14.159

29:23.394 --> 29:24.805
Thank you.

29:24.963 --> 29:28.775
- There once was a woman named Jill--
- Who tried a dynamite stick for a thrill.

29:28.933 --> 29:31.209
- They found her vagina--
- In South Carolina.

29:31.369 --> 29:34.543
And bits of her tits in Brazil.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.153
Excellent to see you.

29:39.377 --> 29:42.551
Oh. Girls like that are
what keeps guys like us young.

29:42.714 --> 29:45.456
I'm sure Bonnie'd be thrilled
to hear you say that.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.359
I'm away for the night. So are you.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.124
Thank you.

29:51.823 --> 29:54.201
Groupies aren't my style.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.034
That's right.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.503
That's right.

29:58.663 --> 30:01.974
You go in for the brainy redheads
in pantsuits.

30:02.133 --> 30:03.635
I don't go in for anyone.

30:04.569 --> 30:05.707
I'm married.

30:06.070 --> 30:09.051
And Patti Robinson, she's a child.

30:25.190 --> 30:28.637
- I can't believe his gall, showing up here.
- It's my apartment.

30:29.127 --> 30:32.267
- I'm gonna give him a piece of my mind.
- Nora, don't. Let it go.

30:32.430 --> 30:35.502
They'll never ban smoking
on airplanes. That's ridiculous.

30:35.667 --> 30:39.740
Maybe, but the FAA's considering it.
Stewardesses are having lung problems.

30:39.904 --> 30:43.374
They're shooting it into their veins,
200 died in the city last year.

30:43.541 --> 30:46.715
- Happy birthday. You look great.
- Ha-ha! Hi.

30:46.878 --> 30:49.324
- I hope you can smoke now.
<i>- I'll</i> do that one.

30:49.714 --> 30:51.022
You're out of your mind.

30:51.182 --> 30:54.391
Five dollars says Newsday's work
on Long Island wins.

30:54.552 --> 30:55.758
It's local.

30:55.920 --> 30:59.094
Guys went to jail. That's how you win
a Pulitzer for public service.

30:59.257 --> 31:02.704
- Nobody's beating Carl Rowan.
- Five dollars.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.169
You're both wrong.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.275
Seymour Hersh is a ringer for My Lai.

31:08.132 --> 31:10.578
Sorry. I know how you like to be right.

31:11.035 --> 31:12.446
What are you even doing here?

31:12.604 --> 31:13.844
I catered this event.

31:14.138 --> 31:15.412
Here, try some duck mousse.

31:21.746 --> 31:23.623
Cindy. Lenny.

31:23.781 --> 31:26.523
Jane! You made it.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.263
Lenny insisted on coming.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.399
- Ned's here.
- Oh!

31:31.756 --> 31:33.667
What happened
to your prior engagement?

31:33.825 --> 31:35.395
Oh, um...

31:35.560 --> 31:37.130
I'm standing him up.

31:37.295 --> 31:38.740
Like on a street corner?

31:38.897 --> 31:41.878
No, no. I called and left a message
at the restaurant.

31:42.033 --> 31:44.445
Jane. Come in.

31:45.536 --> 31:47.311
Do you want a greyhound?

31:47.472 --> 31:49.952
Why don't you put our coats down
and I'll make it?

31:50.108 --> 31:51.143
Yeah, okay.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.220
Not too much grapefruit.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.559
Oh, the coat check is in the bedroom.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.199
Oh...

32:05.790 --> 32:07.770
- Here we go.
- Whoo!

32:09.861 --> 32:10.896
Oh, I got her.

32:11.796 --> 32:13.469
- Is that you?
- Come here.

32:13.631 --> 32:15.633
Charlie, I got her. Come and get her.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.738
Keep QOiFIQ- Go-

32:17.902 --> 32:20.178
He was supposed to be
at poker tonight. I'm sorry.

32:20.338 --> 32:22.249
He's your husband.
He can change his mind.

32:22.407 --> 32:25.547
- I know, but I--
- Today we caught criminals.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.621
Tonight we're friends.

32:29.814 --> 32:31.657
Cat wins.

32:40.491 --> 32:43.062
This isn't for me. Ha-ha-ha!

32:44.963 --> 32:47.910
Well, you know,
my sister doesn't even shave.

32:48.066 --> 32:51.013
All of her friends at Barnard,
they just stopped shaving.

32:51.169 --> 32:52.512
What?

32:52.670 --> 32:54.707
Yeah. Everything.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.051
I thought you weren't coming.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.222
Oh, I changed my mind.

33:03.648 --> 33:06.060
So come toke with us.

33:09.187 --> 33:10.291
I'd love to.

33:17.261 --> 33:18.467
Have you done this before?

33:18.796 --> 33:21.367
Hm? Oh. Heh.

33:21.532 --> 33:22.943
Yeah. Heh.

33:29.140 --> 33:31.882
Holly Hobbie's smoking out.

33:32.643 --> 33:35.180
They should make a doll for that.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.916
Holly Hobbie Smoke-Out.

33:38.349 --> 33:40.192
I'd buy that.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.463
She's really stoned.

33:45.623 --> 33:47.364
Oh, heh-heh.

33:49.127 --> 33:50.606
Oh, no!

33:52.563 --> 33:53.598
I'm okay.

33:55.266 --> 33:56.438
Here, have some more of this.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.985
I feel better now.

34:05.977 --> 34:07.388
I don't know what to say.

34:08.279 --> 34:12.420
As I see it, you're sitting
in a front-row seat to the revolution.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.755
Why not capitalize on it?

34:15.887 --> 34:18.424
That sounds incredible.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.201
Holy shit.

34:22.427 --> 34:24.600
Boola-boola!

34:39.444 --> 34:40.547
- Come on!
- You can do it!

34:40.710 --> 34:43.954
Four, three, two, one!

34:44.681 --> 34:45.717
Mouse wins!

34:49.687 --> 34:52.065
- I'm running the games?
- Of course you are.

34:52.223 --> 34:54.100
Okay, who's next?

34:55.092 --> 34:56.197
Cindy?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.772
Wanna try life as Miss Linnaeus,
species Rodentia?

34:59.430 --> 35:00.636
It is your thing, honey.

35:00.798 --> 35:02.675
I just wrote an article about city mice.

35:02.834 --> 35:06.281
- Ask me anything.
- Was it assigned to someone else?

35:08.072 --> 35:09.278
I'll do it.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.485
- Okay. Well, come in.
- Come on.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.247
Lenny will be the cat.

35:14.412 --> 35:18.485
He seems to really enjoy
putting mice in their place.

35:18.649 --> 35:19.684
I'll sit this one out.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.427
How about you? Noah, is it?

35:28.059 --> 35:29.402
Yeah.

35:30.995 --> 35:32.531
I can do that.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.117
So you know, I ran track in high school.
I can beat any cat.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.524
Pretty fascinating, actually.

35:58.689 --> 36:00.794
Getting in a room
with one of these geniuses.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.268
You sit down,
and you're looking across from them.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.839
Most of the time,
the questions go out of my head...

36:05.997 --> 36:09.137
...but in this particular instance,
we'd been getting along...

36:09.300 --> 36:11.075
...there'd been some alcohol involved.

36:11.235 --> 36:14.910
He stops the interview,
right in the middle, picks up his trumpet...

36:15.072 --> 36:17.348
...and improvises a song
right there on the spot.

36:17.508 --> 36:20.250
Jimmy Page plays the trumpet?

36:21.045 --> 36:23.321
Excuse me. I heard...

36:25.383 --> 36:28.990
Do the words "Miles Davis" sound
anything like "Jimmy Page" to you?

36:31.422 --> 36:32.901
Yeah.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.836
- Kind of.
- Right.

36:35.426 --> 36:39.169
I'm gonna get some air,
and I'm taking this with me.

36:40.598 --> 36:43.909
You're a goddamn saint. That's what
makes you a terrible wingman.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.612
I think I have an idea for my article.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.053
Dinner parties. The history, the trends.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.215
You can have them
even in small spaces.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.860
You're better than that.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.461
No.

37:02.353 --> 37:04.924
- Oh! Hal
- Take all your clothes off.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.100
- Hi.
- Come here.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.501
- Oh, hi.
- You came. Hi.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.970
- What?
- I'm sorry I'm late.

37:15.366 --> 37:18.575
It's fine. It's not like you're my boyfriend.

37:18.936 --> 37:20.711
Where were you?

37:21.005 --> 37:25.818
How would you feel if your not-boyfriend
became an author?

37:26.377 --> 37:27.412
What?

37:27.578 --> 37:29.990
I had drinks at the Yale Club
with a literary agent.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.525
They make women use
the servants' entrance there.

37:32.683 --> 37:33.889
Don't get hung up on that.

37:34.452 --> 37:36.728
He thinks there's a book
in the Panther movement.

37:36.887 --> 37:40.835
He thinks I can write it. Or as he put it,
"I have a front-row seat to a revolution."

37:41.959 --> 37:44.303
Heh. What do you think?

37:46.197 --> 37:48.268
Wow! Heh.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.002
Congratulations.

37:50.401 --> 37:53.473
I'm really grateful for everything
you did on that story, by the way.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.743
It wouldn't even be in print
if it weren't for you.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.748
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.951
And if this book does happen...

38:02.713 --> 38:05.284
...I want you to be my researcher.

38:05.916 --> 38:08.988

38:17.295 --> 38:20.572
I'm telling you, Betty Friedan is planning
the march for August 26th.

38:20.731 --> 38:22.267
We're gonna take over 5th Avenue.

38:22.433 --> 38:24.379
- So disruptive.
- I think that's the point.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.812
- How many women are gonna do it?
- Thousands, maybe millions. Men too.

39:45.516 --> 39:48.793
Oh, sweet girl, you are going

39:48.953 --> 39:53.424
I'll feel exactly the same
as I do right now.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.461
Cindy said you're a Marine?

39:57.862 --> 39:59.864
First Division. Two tours.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.605
Sorry you had to go through it.
What a goddamn boondoggle.

40:04.668 --> 40:07.911
We went there to help.
It got messy, but we wanted to help.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.745
- Of course.
- Nobody's questioning that.

40:09.907 --> 40:13.719
- Actually, Lenny was.
- Cindy.

40:13.878 --> 40:16.722
My position on the war has nothing
to do with the soldiers.

40:16.881 --> 40:19.452
You're heroes fighting
for your country. I respect that.

40:19.617 --> 40:21.563
He just thinks you were sold
a bill of goods.

40:21.719 --> 40:25.690
- He is very antiwar.
- Stop telling people what I think.

40:25.856 --> 40:28.427
- You're not even supposed to be here.
- So I can't speak?

40:28.926 --> 40:30.928
- You saying we're dupes?
- No.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.574
Heh. Good heavens.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.835
Cindy misinterpreted what I said.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.036
My point was...

40:37.201 --> 40:39.909
...no one risks their lives
to defend economic interests.

40:40.237 --> 40:43.013
So we tell them they're saving humanity
from communism.

40:43.174 --> 40:45.984
So you think if we lost Southeast Asia
to Stalinism...

40:46.143 --> 40:49.090
...it wouldn't cause
humanitarian problems?

40:49.246 --> 40:50.623
It'd be a disaster.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.887
But propping up a dictatorship
in South Vietnam is not the answer.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.497
So we win the Cold War
by not fighting?

40:56.654 --> 40:59.601
We have no reason being there
if we don't have a solution.

40:59.757 --> 41:01.202
It's immoral.

41:03.694 --> 41:05.799
Hey, let's take a walk.

41:05.963 --> 41:09.172
I'm sorry, but it's-- It's funny.

41:09.333 --> 41:13.110
I mean, it's funny,
Lenny telling us what's immoral...

41:13.270 --> 41:17.878
...when he is, ugh,
the least moral person that I know.

41:21.946 --> 41:23.755
- Get our coats. I've had enough.
- No.

41:23.914 --> 41:27.327
Whatever this is,
it's between you and Lenny.

41:27.485 --> 41:29.795
You know what this is, Nora.

41:29.954 --> 41:32.366
You know what this is!

41:32.523 --> 41:35.299
You know,
Lenny told me that I had a year.

41:35.759 --> 41:39.673
A year at News of the Week
before I had to start a family.

41:39.830 --> 41:42.572
And then a few months in...

41:42.733 --> 41:44.906
...I find a hole in my diaphragm.

41:46.804 --> 41:50.047
Does that sound very moral
to you guys?

41:50.975 --> 41:54.081
He put a hole in my diaphragm.

41:54.245 --> 41:55.986
You're my wife.

41:58.682 --> 42:00.355
I am.

42:03.420 --> 42:05.593
And I fucked someone else.

42:06.357 --> 42:07.392
<i>OM!</i>

42:07.558 --> 42:09.765
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

42:09.927 --> 42:12.271
- Hey, take it easy.
- Noah.

42:12.429 --> 42:13.999
- Hey, guys.
- Noah! Noah.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.277
- Guys, take it easy.
- What is he doing?

42:18.702 --> 42:20.272
Lenny, are you okay?

42:21.672 --> 42:23.083
Cindy.

42:23.240 --> 42:27.086
You belong here,
with the drunks and the bums.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.790
Hey. Honey, it's okay.

42:30.948 --> 42:32.894
- Look at her.
- Hey.

42:33.050 --> 42:36.293
- Come here. Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

42:36.453 --> 42:39.366
- I'm okay.
- Okay, you're gonna sleep over tonight.

42:39.523 --> 42:41.093
I got her.

42:42.092 --> 42:44.538
Why don't you come stay
with me tonight?

42:46.797 --> 42:49.277
I'm gonna go home with Ned.

42:50.301 --> 42:51.712
It's okay.

42:55.306 --> 42:57.217
Thank you.

42:58.576 --> 42:59.782
Good night, everybody.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.049
Hey, let's-- Let's get out of here.

43:02.212 --> 43:03.748
Let's go grab a beer. Yeah?

43:03.914 --> 43:04.984
Yeah.

43:05.382 --> 43:06.759
Yeah.

43:10.554 --> 43:12.556
I'll see you tomorrow?

43:14.959 --> 43:17.530
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

43:37.715 --> 43:39.388
Those girls, man.

43:39.550 --> 43:42.292
Those girls, they needed us.

43:42.453 --> 43:45.559
When did you become
such an old fuddy-duddy?

43:46.056 --> 43:48.536
I've always been a fuddy-duddy.

43:49.760 --> 43:51.762
That is not true.

43:52.096 --> 43:55.339
In college, you used to be
the craziest bastard I knew.

43:58.769 --> 44:01.249
It was Maine, man.

44:02.139 --> 44:04.415
Turned you into a square.

44:07.144 --> 44:10.148
Almost dying has a way of doing that.

44:12.650 --> 44:15.824
I still don't know what I was thinking,
jumping off that cliff.

44:18.222 --> 44:20.395
If you hadn't have been there...

44:23.394 --> 44:26.000
Strangest sensation realizing
you shouldn't be here.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.473
Man, none of us should be here.

44:28.632 --> 44:31.203
It's all a fucking crapshoot.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.449
Maybe.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.616
You know, maybe 15 years ago,
you would have stripped off...

44:39.777 --> 44:43.884
...that beautiful $50 tie you're wearing
and dived right into that drink.

44:44.048 --> 44:48.019
But now, because you hit your head
on a rock somewhere in Maine...

44:48.485 --> 44:52.558
...now you wanna stand around
and think about doing things instead?

44:53.223 --> 44:58.434
- Are you challenging me to something?
- I would never expect you to risk that tie.

44:58.595 --> 44:59.699
That water is freezing.

44:59.863 --> 45:03.003
That water could kill you.
That is the point, my friend.

45:03.167 --> 45:06.239
But it is better just to stand here
thinking about it, right?

45:06.403 --> 45:08.679
The same way
that you are undoubtedly thinking...

45:08.839 --> 45:12.082
...about making love
to that sweet little redhead.

45:15.579 --> 45:17.889
- You're an asshole, you know that?
- Ha-ha-ha!

45:19.783 --> 45:21.820
Goddamn asshole.

45:21.985 --> 45:23.726
I'm gonna go in to shut you up.

45:24.521 --> 45:26.592
Go in the water.
I'm just going for a swim.

45:26.757 --> 45:29.294
We are doing this.

45:33.297 --> 45:35.709
- You can't go anywhere without me.
- All right.

45:52.149 --> 45:54.595
What a mess. Is Cindy okay?

45:54.985 --> 45:58.262
I don't know. I-- I don't know.

45:58.422 --> 46:00.163
I'm gonna hit the BQE in Brooklyn.

46:00.324 --> 46:02.634
Rumor has it Novo 22 hangs out there.

46:02.793 --> 46:04.773
Should I come back after?

46:10.167 --> 46:12.147
Did I do something, Patti?

46:12.603 --> 46:15.174
I like you so much, Doug.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.447
No, that's not the right word.

46:19.743 --> 46:22.849
I sort of love you.

46:24.882 --> 46:27.886
A few months ago,
you said that without qualifying it.

46:28.051 --> 46:29.758
I know.

46:31.588 --> 46:33.295
Fair enough.

46:34.191 --> 46:37.536
Well, "sort of" love seems
like a good thing, right?

46:38.729 --> 46:40.606
It would be if...

46:41.732 --> 46:43.006
If what, Patti?

46:45.769 --> 46:48.010
If I didn't want what you have.

46:48.705 --> 46:50.514
God, Doug.

46:50.674 --> 46:53.746
When you told me
about the Black Panther book...

46:55.012 --> 46:57.652
I did the research for that.

46:57.815 --> 47:01.729
I wrote some of the copy,
and I sold Finn on the angle.

47:01.885 --> 47:04.991
- And I thanked you for that.
- Yeah, but nobody else knows that.

47:05.856 --> 47:07.631
So you want credit?

47:08.659 --> 47:12.038
Doug, I wanna be a reporter.

47:12.196 --> 47:14.836
I wanna be a reporter.

47:16.667 --> 47:18.476
That's what I want.

47:18.769 --> 47:22.182
Even if it means
I have to go somewhere else to do it.

47:24.007 --> 47:26.681
And I know that now.

47:28.245 --> 47:29.883
And you think I'll get in your way.

47:32.249 --> 47:34.695
If you wanna be a reporter...

47:39.656 --> 47:41.033
Hey.

47:42.726 --> 47:44.501
I wanna help you.

47:47.431 --> 47:50.139
I don't wanna be the enemy. I--

47:50.634 --> 47:55.105
I want you to have everything
you could possibly want.

47:55.739 --> 47:57.275
Really?

47:57.875 --> 47:59.115
Yeah.

47:59.276 --> 48:01.153
Oh, God.

48:05.782 --> 48:07.261
Mmm.

48:14.424 --> 48:15.801
Doug!

48:21.398 --> 48:23.309
- It's green.
- It's green.

48:23.467 --> 48:25.344
Aha!

48:27.104 --> 48:28.447
Thank you, Doug.

48:40.517 --> 48:43.123
Oh. I almost forgot.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.794
Our graffiti story might have
a surprise ending.

48:46.323 --> 48:48.269
Our transit contact...

48:48.558 --> 48:50.265
...swears Novo 22's a girl.

48:51.662 --> 48:54.905
Our anonymous man is a woman?!

49:02.139 --> 49:06.110
It's non-responsive. Finn didn't ask you
to cover reactions to the earthquake.

49:06.276 --> 49:09.485
- He asked you to cover the earthquake.
- You could've done it better?

49:09.646 --> 49:11.387
You know I could've.

49:13.517 --> 49:15.121
Yes, please.

49:17.688 --> 49:20.692
<i>♪ 'Cause I give you all my Iovin" ♪</i>

49:20.857 --> 49:22.837
- Don't be so prickly.
- I'm prickly?

49:22.993 --> 49:25.269
I think you have
a hard time accepting criticism.

49:25.429 --> 49:27.306
- You're unbelievable.
- You're inflexible.

49:27.464 --> 49:30.104
That's a dangerous thing as a journalist.

49:30.267 --> 49:32.873
<i>♪ Girl, what you tryin' to do?' ♪</i>

49:33.036 --> 49:34.674
What is this?

49:34.838 --> 49:38.149
Gabe asked what it would take
for me to make him pancakes.

49:40.277 --> 49:42.484
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Mm-hm.

49:43.347 --> 49:46.123
<i>♪ Why do you make me do bad? N'</i>

49:51.888 --> 49:53.367
<i>Okay-</i>

49:53.523 --> 49:55.969
What about a little story
on the EEOC filing?

49:56.560 --> 50:00.838
A first-person account from someone
with a front-row seat to the revolution.

50:00.998 --> 50:04.172
It could be a window into a wider spread
on Women's Lib.

50:04.334 --> 50:05.369
Don't call it that.

50:09.506 --> 50:10.917
That's not such a little idea.

50:12.909 --> 50:13.979
Really?

50:15.278 --> 50:17.519
I think you just struck gold.

50:38.535 --> 50:40.879
Ha-ha! Good writing.

50:43.006 --> 50:45.316
- Hey!
- Go.

50:45.475 --> 50:46.545
- Hey!
- Come on.

50:46.710 --> 50:47.950
- Grab your bag.
- Now.

52:03.854 --> 52:05.197
I had so much fun tonight.

52:06.089 --> 52:09.832
- I'm so glad you stood up your date.
- Ha-ha-ha!

52:11.428 --> 52:13.101
My dad is gonna be livid.

52:13.730 --> 52:14.765
You stood up your dad?

52:18.001 --> 52:20.379
It was a job interview.

52:21.571 --> 52:22.982
Since I'm not marrying Chad...

52:23.140 --> 52:26.917
...Daddy thinks I need to work somewhere
with more appropriate men.

52:29.346 --> 52:31.417
What do you think?

52:32.983 --> 52:34.462
I love my job.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.958
Jane...

52:41.057 --> 52:43.037
...are you becoming a career girl?

52:44.027 --> 52:45.529
Maybe I always was.

52:48.765 --> 52:50.904
Hey, everybody!

52:51.067 --> 52:54.139
Jane Hollander is a career girl!

52:54.304 --> 52:56.978
- Patti.
- Jane.

53:01.711 --> 53:04.885
- I'm a career girl!
- Whoo!

53:05.048 --> 53:08.029
New of the Week is the best magazine!

53:08.185 --> 53:10.722
- I love my job!
- It's my birthday!

53:10.887 --> 53:13.265
And I'm not having a white wedding!

53:13.423 --> 53:15.460
Whoa! What?

53:19.729 --> 53:22.608
I lost my virginity to my neighbor.

53:24.768 --> 53:28.580
I had sex with my dad's best friend
when I was in college.

53:33.843 --> 53:35.015
I-

53:35.412 --> 53:40.293
I lost my mother's bracelet once
and I blamed it on my grandmother.

53:42.185 --> 53:45.997
Oh, I've wanted to tell you
about something for the longest time.

53:47.624 --> 53:52.095
Some of the other girls and I are filing
an Equal Employment claim.

53:52.495 --> 53:56.739
It's illegal for them not to let us write,
and we want the policy changed.

53:58.001 --> 53:59.674
What?

54:00.670 --> 54:02.115
<i>You're suing News of the Week?</i>

54:02.272 --> 54:06.220
No. No, not suing.
We are complaining, officially.

54:06.643 --> 54:09.146
And I'm gonna write an article about it.

54:09.813 --> 54:12.419
Is this why you've been so secretive
at the office?

54:13.149 --> 54:16.130
- You and Cindy and all the other girls?
- Yeah.

54:17.354 --> 54:20.801
- Oh.
- Come on, be a part of it with us.

54:23.159 --> 54:25.298
You deserve it.

54:27.230 --> 54:30.541
You know, I've had
a really lovely time tonight, but...

54:31.401 --> 54:35.281
...I am way too high to think about
whatever it is you're saying.

54:52.555 --> 54:54.000
Hey!

55:02.732 --> 55:06.874
Next time you write about the Panthers,
remember whose fucking side you're on!
