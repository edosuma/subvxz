00:00.333 --> 00:02.600
-You have one child together.
-Correct, Your Honor.

00:02.667 --> 00:05.233
You found a phone
his father had bought for him.

00:05.300 --> 00:08.667
This is what his mother said
she found on the phone.

00:08.734 --> 00:12.600
That's-that's disturbing.
That is disturbing, Your Honor.

00:12.667 --> 00:15.367
-[Judy] Yeah, it's disturbing.
-[sobs]

00:15.433 --> 00:17.834
It would be disturbing
to me as a parent.

[Kevin] Court, come to order.
All rise.

00:47.667 --> 00:48.767
Be seated, please.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.266
Hello, Judge. Case 1058,
Kirkpatrick versus Kirkpatrick.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.700
-Thank you, Kevin.
-You're welcome.

00:56.834 --> 00:59.900
Mr. Kirkpatrick,
you and your wife, ex-wife,

00:59.967 --> 01:02.467
were married
for a short period of time,

01:02.533 --> 01:04.033
and you have one child together?

01:04.100 --> 01:05.066
Correct, Your Honor.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.667
Your marriage was short-lived,

01:06.734 --> 01:11.000
and based upon what I read,
for a period of time...

01:11.066 --> 01:12.033
Your son is now ten?

01:12.100 --> 01:13.000
Yes, Your Honor.

01:13.066 --> 01:15.266
For a period of time
after your divorce,

01:15.333 --> 01:16.667
and you were divorced
or separated

01:16.734 --> 01:17.967
after about a year of marriage?

01:18.033 --> 01:19.000
Correct.

01:19.066 --> 01:21.133
You shared custody of him.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.200
Correct, Your Honor.

01:22.266 --> 01:24.934
[Judy] But then at some point
a couple of years ago,

01:25.000 --> 01:28.967
that changed, and you have now
full custody of him.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.633
He stays with you all the time,

01:30.700 --> 01:32.500
with the exception
of periods of time

01:32.567 --> 01:33.767
when he visits with his mother.

01:33.834 --> 01:35.266
-Correct, Your Honor.
-[Judy] Is that--?

01:35.333 --> 01:37.367
Okay. You say no.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.800
He's ten years old.
Does he go to public school?

01:39.867 --> 01:40.867
You don't shake your head.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.000
Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

01:42.066 --> 01:43.633
And what grade is he in?

01:43.700 --> 01:44.900
He's in fifth grade.

01:44.967 --> 01:47.333
From whose house does he
go to school every day?

01:47.400 --> 01:49.400
His house in DeLand.

01:49.467 --> 01:50.433
His house?

01:50.500 --> 01:51.533
-Yes.
-[Judy] All right.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600
And what does he do
for the summer?

01:53.667 --> 01:55.800
I, I, well, I...

01:55.867 --> 01:57.467
No, no, what does he do
for the summer?

01:57.533 --> 02:00.734
Well, I had put him in,
uh, summer programs

02:00.800 --> 02:03.333
until COVID happened.
Then we didn't do that.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.000
But that's-that's what
I had-had him going to.

02:06.066 --> 02:08.700
And where does he sleep
during the summer?

02:08.767 --> 02:10.900
In my house in his room.

02:10.967 --> 02:11.967
[Judy] Is that correct?

02:12.033 --> 02:13.033
Yes.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.433
[Judy] Well, then he has
custody of him.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.934
He has physical custody of him.

02:16.000 --> 02:16.934
No.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.266
I mean, well, he does.

02:18.333 --> 02:20.000
-[Beri] I'm sorry.
-Well, but he does.

02:20.066 --> 02:22.934
If he goes to school
from his house every day,

02:23.000 --> 02:26.266
and if he sleeps at his house
during the summer,

02:26.333 --> 02:29.200
then he may not have
full legal custody of him,

02:29.266 --> 02:31.467
that may not have been decided
by a court,

02:31.533 --> 02:33.667
but he has physical custody of him.

02:33.734 --> 02:35.266
-May I?
-[Judy] What?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.133
There is a, uh,
court hearing coming up

02:38.200 --> 02:43.333
September 21st of next month
where I have filed with

02:43.400 --> 02:47.934
the Volusia County court system
in Florida, uh, the contempt

02:48.000 --> 02:51.367
because he has been
withholding Titan from me, and so...

02:51.433 --> 02:52.934
Listen, I don't want to hear--

02:53.000 --> 02:54.633
-[Beri] We have--
-He has been...

02:54.700 --> 02:57.400
he has been living
with his father.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.667
Did he go to school
from his father's house

02:59.734 --> 03:00.867
in the fourth grade?

03:00.934 --> 03:03.600
That's either a "yes" or a "no",
that's either a "yes" or a "no".

03:03.667 --> 03:04.600
-Yes.
-[Judy] Did he go to

03:04.667 --> 03:06.100
his father's house
in the fourth grade?

03:06.166 --> 03:07.734
-[Beri] Yes, but--
-That was--

03:07.800 --> 03:09.066
that was 2020.

03:09.133 --> 03:12.600
I don't know if school is open.
Now, where you live, is it?

03:12.667 --> 03:14.300
-It is now.
-[Judy] When did it open?

03:14.367 --> 03:16.266
This was the first week
of school, actually.

03:16.333 --> 03:19.900
Okay. So he's going to school
from your house this year? 2021?

03:19.967 --> 03:23.133
-Yes, Your Honor.
-[Judy] In 2019 was when you say

03:23.200 --> 03:24.767
he came to live with you
full time.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.533
In what month?

03:26.600 --> 03:28.333
July, Your Honor.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.767
In September of 2019, did he
go to school from your house?

03:31.834 --> 03:33.166
Yes, Your Honor.

03:33.233 --> 03:36.133
-[Judy] October, November?
-Yes, Your Honor.

03:36.200 --> 03:40.433
You may have a hearing
coming up, Ms. Kirkpatrick.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.600
But for the last two years,

03:42.667 --> 03:46.300
his father has had
physical custody of him

03:46.367 --> 03:48.333
for the majority of the time.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.000
So, you can shake your head
all you like, that's it.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.767
And I don't have to get
into the reasons for it.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.333
But his father has had
physical custody of him.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.133
This is what this case is about.

03:59.200 --> 04:04.567
On Mother's Day, this past year,
according to the complaint,

04:04.633 --> 04:07.700
you brought your son over
to visit with his mother?

04:07.767 --> 04:08.734
Yes, Your Honor.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
[Judy] By the way,
are you employed, sir?

04:10.867 --> 04:12.100
I am, Your Honor. Yes.

04:12.166 --> 04:14.333
And aside from your son,
who do you live with?

04:14.400 --> 04:15.867
Just myself.

04:15.934 --> 04:17.700
Does someone take care of him
when you're not--

04:17.767 --> 04:19.200
after school, while you work?

04:19.266 --> 04:21.700
Either he'll come with me
and be at the office

04:21.767 --> 04:24.133
or, um, I have it
so that he's home.

04:24.200 --> 04:28.300
He's almost 11, and that's why
I have him-- have a phone

04:28.367 --> 04:31.166
so that if he needs to call me,
or if there's an emergency,

04:31.233 --> 04:33.000
he can call me which,
there never is one.

04:33.066 --> 04:34.200
What kind of work do you do?

04:34.266 --> 04:35.567
I'm a marketing consultant.

04:35.633 --> 04:37.734
I do advertising
for a local newspaper.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.233
And Ms. Kirkpatrick,
what do you do for a living?

04:40.300 --> 04:45.000
I'm a homemaker, um,
and I also do outdoor tree work

04:45.066 --> 04:48.367
with my boyfriend
as self-employed.

04:49.266 --> 04:52.133
You're a homemaker.
Do you have other children?

04:52.200 --> 04:53.800
No, Titan is my only.

04:53.867 --> 04:55.700
You mean, you stay home.

04:55.767 --> 04:58.400
I was a stay-at-home mom
until he took that away from me.

04:58.467 --> 05:00.633
Okay, we're talking about
two and a half years ago.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.300
I'm asking you what you do now.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.967
Yes, I'm--
yes, a homemaker.

05:05.033 --> 05:08.066
-Okay. You don't have a-a child.
-[Beri] Self-employed.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.800
You're self-employed,
and where do you live?

05:10.867 --> 05:13.400
In De Leon Springs, Florida.

05:13.467 --> 05:14.700
Where? House?

05:14.767 --> 05:16.500
[Beri] Yes, it's a house.

05:16.567 --> 05:17.834
[Judy] Who do you live with?

05:17.900 --> 05:19.100
Uh, my grandmother.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.333
[Judy] It's her house?

05:20.400 --> 05:21.967
Yes, it's her house.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.266
[Judy] How long have you
been living there?

05:23.333 --> 05:28.767
Uh, since, uh, 2017.
End of 2017.

05:28.834 --> 05:32.433
Your-- Your Honor, may I,
may I interject just quickly?

05:32.500 --> 05:33.567
What?

05:33.633 --> 05:34.900
It's not actually
her grandmother's house.

05:34.967 --> 05:37.800
She rents. And she doesn't
live in the house.

05:37.867 --> 05:41.767
Beri lives in a detached
garage of the house.

05:41.834 --> 05:43.333
Her grandmother
rents the house?

05:43.400 --> 05:45.166
Yes, Your Honor.
It's-it's not her house.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.700
Do you live inside the house
or in the garage?

05:47.767 --> 05:50.567
It's an apartment.
It's not an actual garage.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.800
Yes, I live
in the "detached unit."

05:53.867 --> 05:55.000
Describe it to me.

05:55.066 --> 05:57.133
[Beri] It's fully
remodeled, renovated.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.567
Looks like a, a nice
apartment inside.

05:59.633 --> 06:01.200
[Judy] Has a bathroom, shower?

06:01.266 --> 06:03.266
No, I have
no running water yet.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.333
But if I shower, it's inside.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.500
You go into your
grandmother's house?

06:06.567 --> 06:07.533
Right.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.233
So that it has
no running water?

06:09.300 --> 06:10.633
Correct.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.867
I don't know quite
how to say this to you

06:13.934 --> 06:16.133
without sounding harsh.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.633
He works and takes care of
a ten-year-old full time.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.200
You do nothing.

06:21.266 --> 06:23.633
Being a homemaker
without children

06:23.700 --> 06:26.767
and without a husband means
you take care of yourself.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.033
[Beri] Right.

07:06.100 --> 07:07.867
So that it has
no running water.

07:07.934 --> 07:09.066
[Beri] Correct.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.533
And you live there
with your boyfriend?

07:10.600 --> 07:11.934
He lives with-- yeah.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.600
-That's him?
-Yes, that...

07:13.667 --> 07:14.600
[Judy] On Mother's Day weekend,

07:14.667 --> 07:17.066
you dropped your son off
to visit with his mother.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.066
-[William] Yes.
-For the whole weekend,

07:18.133 --> 07:20.400
Saturday and Sunday,
or just Sunday?

07:20.467 --> 07:22.734
He was actually there
for, uh, a week

07:22.800 --> 07:24.333
because she wanted him
to stay longer.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.633
While he was there,
you had given him a phone?

07:27.700 --> 07:28.734
Yes, Your Honor.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.100
[Judy] To have,
and according to you,

07:31.166 --> 07:33.100
the phone was returned
with your son,

07:33.166 --> 07:34.934
but in a disabled condition

07:35.000 --> 07:37.166
-so that you could no longer use it,
-Yes, Your Honor.

07:37.233 --> 07:40.834
because his mother had put
a tracker on the phone.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.033
Yes, Your Honor.
She had put up a,

07:42.100 --> 07:45.834
a parenting application on it,
like a parental lock

07:45.900 --> 07:48.834
that only she could allow
things to happen.

07:48.900 --> 07:51.867
She had set up a, a passcode
with a Gmail account

07:51.934 --> 07:52.867
that only she knew.

07:52.934 --> 07:54.867
In addition to that,
she also did a tracking,

07:54.934 --> 07:57.567
put a tracking app on it
so that she could monitor it

07:57.633 --> 07:59.934
as long as it's on,
in real time.

08:00.066 --> 08:01.033
[Judy] Did you do that?

08:01.100 --> 08:02.100
Yes, I did.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.500
[Judy] Okay.
Did you buy the phone?

08:03.567 --> 08:04.500
[Beri] No.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.200
You want to explain to me
why you modified the phone?

08:07.266 --> 08:10.600
Yes. I had no knowledge
that Titan had a phone.

08:10.667 --> 08:11.600
[Judy] Okay.

08:11.667 --> 08:15.200
So, when my son came to visit
on Mother's Day weekend,

08:15.266 --> 08:18.300
while he was with
my grandmother, I, uh, was,

08:18.367 --> 08:19.834
I heard a jingle go off,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.800
and the jingle was coming
from his bookbag.

08:22.867 --> 08:24.533
So, I pulled out the phone

08:24.600 --> 08:28.066
and it was a bedtime alarm
that had went off.

08:28.133 --> 08:29.700
And so I just turned it off.

08:30.367 --> 08:34.667
And when I turned it off,
I was surprised

08:34.734 --> 08:37.700
that Titan had a phone because
I was told that he didn't,

08:37.767 --> 08:40.066
because I had been wanting
to buy him a phone

08:40.133 --> 08:41.233
with a working number.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.433
[whispers] Whatever.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.533
-[Beri] And--
-Let's move on.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.667
You found a phone.
So, you knew his father had--

08:45.734 --> 08:47.633
-Yes.
-[Judy] Bought a phone for him.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.700
-Yes.
-[Judy] And he had it?

08:49.767 --> 08:50.700
Mm-hmm.

08:50.767 --> 08:52.066
[Judy] And that you hadn't
purchased it.

08:52.133 --> 08:53.166
And so what did you do?

08:53.233 --> 08:55.000
Well, I went
through the phone.

08:55.066 --> 08:56.200
[Judy] Why?

08:56.266 --> 08:59.700
I'm his mother.
And I was, I mean...

08:59.767 --> 09:01.600
First of all,
you had no knowledge

09:01.667 --> 09:03.567
whether it was his phone
or his father's phone.

09:03.633 --> 09:05.767
It had Dragon Ball Z
wallpaper on it,

09:05.834 --> 09:07.967
with Titan's name all over it.

09:08.033 --> 09:10.000
That's okay.
I have a picture

09:10.066 --> 09:13.166
of my deceased dog on my phone
as my wallpaper.

09:13.233 --> 09:15.166
-So, you went through the phone?
-[Beri] Yes.

09:15.233 --> 09:17.633
Did you need a passcode
in order to go through the phone?

09:17.700 --> 09:20.633
No. There was no lock on it.

09:20.700 --> 09:24.166
[Judy] Okay. So, you went
through the phone and...?

09:24.233 --> 09:29.066
I found that I was not listed
as a contact in the phone.

09:29.133 --> 09:33.500
He and his girlfriend only
were contacts in the phone.

09:33.567 --> 09:36.133
And messaging
was only taking place

09:36.600 --> 09:39.600
through him and his girlfriend.

09:39.667 --> 09:45.000
And I also checked the browser
history of the phone as well.

09:45.066 --> 09:48.700
And I-I have,
I have some things that, um,

09:48.767 --> 09:50.333
I would like to share with you.

09:50.400 --> 09:51.567
Absolutely.

09:51.633 --> 09:55.700
Which is why I put the,
uh, it's called Family Link.

09:55.767 --> 09:59.233
It's a parental,
it's a parental lock

09:59.300 --> 10:00.967
for the safety of your child.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.567
How did you,
Ms. Kirkpatrick,

10:03.633 --> 10:05.767
how did you communicate
with your former husband

10:05.834 --> 10:09.800
about him dropping off your son
and picking him up?

10:09.867 --> 10:11.567
Was that by phone or text?

10:11.633 --> 10:13.100
Mostly by text.

10:13.166 --> 10:16.166
[Judy] Okay. And so
you have a phone?

10:16.233 --> 10:17.300
I have one, yes.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.367
[Judy] And he has one?

10:18.433 --> 10:19.400
Yes.

10:19.467 --> 10:20.600
Well, is there any reason

10:20.667 --> 10:24.066
why you didn't contact
your former husband

10:24.133 --> 10:27.900
since he had acquiesced
to bringing your son to you

10:27.967 --> 10:29.934
for the weekend
on Mother's Day?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.100
Is there any reason
why you didn't contact him

10:33.166 --> 10:35.367
and said,
"I found this phone

10:35.433 --> 10:38.633
that I assume you bought
for Titan." Titan?

10:38.700 --> 10:40.133
Titan, Your Honor.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.166
[Judy] "I'm not listed as a contact."

10:42.233 --> 10:46.166
You know, is there any reason
why you didn't do that?

10:46.233 --> 10:49.000
I, uh... well, yeah.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.567
[Judy] What's the reason?

10:50.633 --> 10:52.567
No, I don't know the reason.
He never said--

10:52.633 --> 10:55.133
No, what's the reason
you didn't call him, text him?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.300
[Beri] Oh, I called him.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.500
And say, "I found a phone.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.567
I didn't know
that Titan had a phone.

11:00.633 --> 11:02.800
I want to be listed
as a contact."

11:02.867 --> 11:05.934
She wants to show me something
that she's going to say

11:06.000 --> 11:09.700
explains why she took
control of this phone.

11:09.767 --> 11:11.800
So, I'd like to
take a look at it.

11:12.333 --> 11:14.433
[William] Your Honor, may,
may I add something quickly?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.166
[Judy] No. First,
I want to look at this,

11:16.233 --> 11:17.700
and then I'll ask you questions.

11:18.867 --> 11:19.800
Sorry.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.533
Don't give me a whole bunch
of stuff that's meaningless.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.633
I don't want to read stuff
that's meaningless.

11:37.233 --> 11:38.700
What is this a picture of?

11:38.767 --> 11:42.367
That is a picture from
Titan that he took a picture

11:42.433 --> 11:45.233
of himself sending to his dad,

11:45.300 --> 11:47.967
stating that he still
wasn't feeling well.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.100
-[Judy] Okay.
-That he wants

11:49.166 --> 11:50.100
to go to the doctor.

11:50.166 --> 11:53.700
I see that. I see that. "I still think...
[reading to self indistinctly]

11:53.767 --> 11:55.266
...for space if I don't--

11:55.333 --> 11:56.867
won't be able to play
any more games

11:56.934 --> 11:59.600
because... [indistinct]
I can't play games."

11:59.667 --> 12:01.000
What is--?

12:01.066 --> 12:02.834
I don't know what this is.
It's nothing.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.166
"Titan, bedtime
in ten minutes.

12:04.233 --> 12:06.967
I'll be home soon,
sleep in your bed tonight."

12:07.033 --> 12:08.900
Well, so far, the only thing

12:08.967 --> 12:12.567
that would be
troublesome to me--

12:12.633 --> 12:16.633
for a kid, these things.

12:16.700 --> 12:21.066
Okay, so is it your son who's
doing all this cursing, sir?

12:21.133 --> 12:24.033
Unfortunately,
it's a little, uh, side effect

12:24.100 --> 12:26.000
he picked up from public school.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.266
[Judy] Yeah. He... you know.

12:29.867 --> 12:32.367
He seems to be-- well, first,
I'm going to show this to you.

12:32.433 --> 12:36.367
This is what his mother said
she found on the phone.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.500
-[William] Thank you.
-[Kevin] Mm-hmm.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.133
Yeah, that's-that's something

12:49.200 --> 12:52.800
that I should have been
probably, uh, told about.

12:52.867 --> 12:53.867
[Judy] Hmmm?

12:53.934 --> 12:56.967
I didn't know. I had no idea
that that was on there.

12:57.400 --> 13:01.000
Okay. And you have a girlfriend
whose name is Holly?

13:01.066 --> 13:02.166
Correct.

13:02.233 --> 13:05.700
[Judy] Okay. And I assume
that there's a little bit of

13:05.767 --> 13:08.667
sometimes tension
with Titan and Holly?

13:08.734 --> 13:09.700
No, not at all.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.667
[Judy] Okay. There was
some suggestion there

13:12.734 --> 13:17.033
about sleeping
in the same bed with her.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.033
My son?

13:19.100 --> 13:21.033
[Judy] Yeah, there's a big--
something about the bed--

13:21.100 --> 13:23.033
bed isn't big enough for three.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.100
Oh, [laughs] because,

13:25.166 --> 13:28.133
uh, he still likes to
crawl in sometimes into my bed,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.367
even though he has his own room
and bed and everything.

13:30.433 --> 13:33.033
And I was like, "Titan, you need
to go sleep in your room."

13:33.100 --> 13:34.467
I was trying to
play around with him.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.467
[Judy] Okay.

13:35.533 --> 13:36.800
[William] Yeah.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.467
Okay. So, those things
came off the phone.

13:41.533 --> 13:42.734
[William]
Mm-hmm. That's disturbing.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.567
-[Judy] Hmm?
-That is disturbing, Your Honor.

13:44.633 --> 13:45.834
[Judy] Yeah, it's disturbing.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.767
It would be disturbing
to me as a parent.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.734
The realities
of the situation is,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.000
he is a single parent

13:53.066 --> 13:55.734
raising a ten-year-old
full-time himself.

13:55.800 --> 14:00.600
And he wasn't swift enough
and engaged enough

14:00.667 --> 14:03.767
to see that his son
was starting to fool around

14:03.834 --> 14:06.433
on the Internet
in places where he shouldn't.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.500
[theme music]

14:16.100 --> 14:19.166
[narrator] <i>William Kirkpatrick</i>
<i>is accusing his ex-wife,</i>

14:19.233 --> 14:21.633
<i>Beri Kirkpatrick,</i>
<i>of modifying his phone</i>

14:21.700 --> 14:22.800
<i>without permission.</i>

14:22.867 --> 14:26.400
<i>Beri claims her actions were</i>
<i>to protect their young son</i>

14:26.467 --> 14:28.300
<i>from adult content.</i>

14:28.367 --> 14:31.967
Okay. So, those things
came off the phone.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.133
Mm-hmm. That's disturbing.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.133
-[Judy] Hmm?
-That is disturbing, Your Honor.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.467
[Judy] Yeah, it's disturbing.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.433
It would be disturbing to me
as a parent.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.567
And the reaction should be,
as a parent,

14:40.633 --> 14:42.433
to call the other parent and say,

14:42.500 --> 14:44.166
this is what's going on
with the phone.

14:46.300 --> 14:49.367
You may not know about it, because...

14:52.100 --> 14:54.533
I don't know quite
how to say this to you

14:54.600 --> 14:57.033
without sounding harsh.

14:57.100 --> 15:00.700
He works and takes care
of a ten-year-old full-time.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.200
You do nothing.
Being a homemaker,

15:03.266 --> 15:05.500
without children
and without a husband,

15:05.567 --> 15:07.834
it means you take care
of yourself.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.600
That's what you're telling me.

15:09.667 --> 15:13.200
So, if you're trying to juggle
taking care of a ten-year-old,

15:13.266 --> 15:15.633
trying to have a social life,
and trying to work full-time,

15:15.700 --> 15:17.900
I assume that you're not
paying any child support,

15:17.967 --> 15:22.133
Ms. Kirkpatrick.
I assume that that's true.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.300
It's true, Your Honor.

15:23.367 --> 15:25.533
[Judy] Then, what you do is,
you pick up the phone

15:25.600 --> 15:27.834
and call the person
who's been in charge of your son

15:27.900 --> 15:30.233
for two and a half years
and say, "Listen,

15:30.300 --> 15:33.200
this ten-year-old is..."

15:33.266 --> 15:34.533
[sobs]

15:34.600 --> 15:38.266
"...cursing.
This ten-year-old is cursing."

15:38.333 --> 15:40.567
It's on the phone.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.400
You've addressed it,
but clearly not enough.

15:42.467 --> 15:44.467
"And I found these videos,

15:44.533 --> 15:47.667
these smutty videos
that he's involved with."

15:48.333 --> 15:50.033
Do you need a tissue?

15:50.633 --> 15:53.400
[whispering] I'm okay. I'm okay.

15:53.467 --> 15:54.533
-Okay.
-[Beri] Yeah, I'm okay.

15:54.600 --> 15:55.633
That's what you do.

15:55.700 --> 15:58.400
You don't have,
that's what you do as a parent.

15:58.467 --> 16:01.400
And you do have to have
a certain amount of recognition

16:01.467 --> 16:03.667
of what the realities
of the situation are.

16:03.734 --> 16:05.867
The reality of the situation is,

16:05.934 --> 16:08.567
he is a single parent
raising a ten-year-old,

16:08.633 --> 16:09.934
full-time himself.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.600
And he wasn't swift enough
and engaged enough

16:14.667 --> 16:17.900
to see that his son
was starting to fool around

16:17.967 --> 16:21.200
on the Internet
in places where he shouldn't be.

16:21.266 --> 16:23.934
Your response isn't
to destroy the phone.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.633
Your response should be,
"I'm taking the phone away,

16:26.700 --> 16:28.967
I'm going to give it to you
and show you what I've done,"

16:29.033 --> 16:32.133
not to disable the phone
and put on a tracking system.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.333
Do you understand,
Ms. Kirkpatrick?

16:35.433 --> 16:37.133
Do you understand?

16:37.200 --> 16:38.233
Yes, I do.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.734
[Judy] Okay. That's my view.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.767
And I don't know
what's going to happen

16:42.834 --> 16:46.300
when you have your hearing
next month,

16:46.367 --> 16:49.800
but at this point, and at least
for the past several years,

16:49.867 --> 16:52.433
his father has been
in charge of him.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.633
And it doesn't appear to me,

16:55.700 --> 16:59.066
at least by the fact
that he brought him to you

16:59.133 --> 17:01.834
when you wanted to see him
over Mother's Day weekend,

17:01.900 --> 17:05.166
and you wanted to keep him
for a week and you did,

17:05.233 --> 17:09.934
that that could have had some,
perhaps some selfish intentions too.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.266
You wanted a little time off.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.066
It's very difficult
as a single parent

17:13.133 --> 17:16.367
to have a life
in addition to raising a child,

17:16.433 --> 17:18.033
I do understand that.

17:19.266 --> 17:23.567
But you can't disable something
that you didn't purchase.

17:23.633 --> 17:24.900
How much was the phone?

17:24.967 --> 17:26.700
Uh, the phone was--

17:26.767 --> 17:28.367
I have receipts here, Your Honor.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.867
It came to 117.84.

17:34.934 --> 17:36.433
[Judy] May I see it, please?

17:36.500 --> 17:38.033
I have the other
receipt on there too,

17:38.100 --> 17:41.233
because I gave my son my phone
and I get--

17:41.300 --> 17:43.834
and I had to get another phone

17:44.333 --> 17:45.800
-so that I would have a phone.
-[Judy] No.

17:45.867 --> 17:48.667
I just want to know
how much the phone was.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.433
That's the first receipt,
ma'am. I'm sorry.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.033
Okay. And this was
purchased in January?

17:57.100 --> 17:58.100
Yes, ma'am.

17:58.166 --> 18:01.567
[Judy] Okay. That's it.
You're entitled to that.

18:01.633 --> 18:02.800
I don't know what else
you're suing for here.

18:02.867 --> 18:05.700
It looks-- a thousand dollars,

18:05.767 --> 18:07.433
invasion of privacy, property.

18:08.700 --> 18:09.667
She shouldn't have done it,

18:09.734 --> 18:12.100
but at least she brought
something to your attention

18:12.166 --> 18:13.867
so that if you did, in fact,

18:13.934 --> 18:15.533
buy him or get him
another phone,

18:15.600 --> 18:18.633
something that you should have
in the back of your head,

18:18.700 --> 18:20.934
that he's swift enough
to get on the Internet

18:21.000 --> 18:24.767
even at age ten or 11,
and find places

18:24.834 --> 18:26.433
that can cause
nothing but trouble.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.767
And apparently,
based upon what I read,

18:28.834 --> 18:30.867
you're not home
when you're working.

18:30.934 --> 18:33.000
He spends a lot of time
by himself.

18:33.066 --> 18:34.000
A few hours of the day.

18:34.066 --> 18:35.000
[Judy] A few hours.

18:35.066 --> 18:36.567
Well, in a few hours,
a lot of trouble can happen.

18:36.633 --> 18:38.867
So, be-be much more cautious.

18:38.934 --> 18:39.967
Judgment for the plaintiff

18:40.033 --> 18:42.533
in the amount of the phone, 174.
Thank you.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.734
[Kevin] Court is adjourned.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.767
I'm-I'm very disappointed.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.300
Well, I'm glad
that I got something back.

18:49.367 --> 18:52.567
There's a lot of information
that was not brought up

18:52.633 --> 18:54.500
that played a big factor.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.433
This has been something
that's been going on

18:56.500 --> 18:57.567
for years and years.

18:57.633 --> 18:59.633
And it, you know,
breaks my heart.

18:59.700 --> 19:00.834
She's always doing this,

19:00.900 --> 19:04.200
so at least something,
uh, was-was done.

19:04.266 --> 19:05.934
You know,
when I said homemaker,

19:06.000 --> 19:10.700
like, I'm hoping for the day
when my son can come back home.

19:10.767 --> 19:12.633
She has been difficult
for the last ten years, so...

19:12.700 --> 19:16.166
Will has been
keeping him from me.

19:16.233 --> 19:17.967
He's my-- He's my everything.

19:18.033 --> 19:21.800
I want to have the 50 percent
that I'm entitled to.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.400
I would love for things
to be amicable,

19:23.467 --> 19:24.767
but I don't see it happening.

19:24.834 --> 19:26.567
I'll keep waiting for my day.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.967
So, I'm asking your opinion,

19:30.033 --> 19:34.166
because I know that
the defendant was very upset.

19:34.233 --> 19:38.266
I mean, it was apparent to me
that he was parenting this child

19:38.333 --> 19:39.900
and she probably
feels badly about it.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.333
I don't know
what kind of situation

19:42.400 --> 19:44.300
she hopes to present
to the court next month

19:44.367 --> 19:45.567
when she has a hearing.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.000
But if she's living in a garage

19:48.066 --> 19:50.667
with no running water
and no plumbing,

19:50.734 --> 19:51.667
with her boyfriend,

19:51.734 --> 19:54.300
that is certainly not
a reasonable situation.

19:54.367 --> 19:56.533
She is unemployed,
and he's employed full-time.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.967
He probably would prefer being
in a place with fewer rules.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.400
His father has some rules.

20:02.467 --> 20:04.900
But his father wasn't vigilant
enough with the phone.

20:04.967 --> 20:07.400
I think there's such a good
lesson there to be learned,

20:07.467 --> 20:09.166
even for a kid
that's ten, you know,

20:09.233 --> 20:12.000
they've grown up
on the Internet, like you.

20:12.066 --> 20:14.900
-Mm-hmm.
-You have two younger siblings.

20:14.967 --> 20:18.433
Did you grow up with a phone
when you were two or three?

20:18.500 --> 20:23.600
No. I had a flip phone
at age 14, 15.

20:23.667 --> 20:24.567
-[Judy] Fifteen.
-Maybe.

20:24.633 --> 20:28.567
Maybe. But grow up
on the Internet. I mean...

20:28.633 --> 20:30.567
No, we-we had
the one computer

20:30.633 --> 20:32.567
in the "computer room"
in the house

20:32.633 --> 20:34.700
that the parents also used,

20:34.767 --> 20:38.700
so you never dabbled in
any of the, uh, non-kosher,

20:38.767 --> 20:40.367
-you could say. [laughs]
-[laughs] Well...

20:40.433 --> 20:42.133
On, on the family computer,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.300
and the phone didn't have
Internet back then.

20:44.367 --> 20:47.667
But I know now my younger
siblings can be on their phones

20:47.734 --> 20:49.333
in their rooms for hours.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.467
No one knows,
talking to their friends.

20:51.533 --> 20:53.333
Even-even the little ones.

20:53.400 --> 20:58.400
I mean, they, I see them
negotiating their little iPads

20:58.467 --> 20:59.667
when they're two.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.767
So, these kids,
by the time they're ten,

21:01.834 --> 21:02.767
they're pretty sophisticated.

21:02.834 --> 21:05.700
It's just a really good example of,

21:05.767 --> 21:09.567
you have to be vigilant about
what your kids are doing

21:09.633 --> 21:13.900
behind their closed door
in their room, on a computer.

21:13.967 --> 21:15.100
It could be dangerous.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.667
-Yeah.
-Anyway...
