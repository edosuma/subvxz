WEBVTT

00:06.040 --> 00:08.209
Better Things, all new.
Thursdays at 10:00.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.711
Starts February 28 on FX.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.317
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.055
* Hey, girl, with the boots on,
how 'bout you come this way *

00:21.089 --> 00:23.691
* So we can do something,
I looked all around the spot *

00:23.724 --> 00:25.659
* There's some cool ones *

00:25.693 --> 00:27.928
* But ain't nobody more
beautiful than you, hon *

00:27.961 --> 00:29.997
* Come on, dance with me,
baby girl, move something *

00:30.030 --> 00:32.266
* Baby, we can get it in
like a shoehorn *

00:32.300 --> 00:34.935
* Oh! *

00:34.968 --> 00:37.738
GRETCHEN:
I think I follow
too many porn sites.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.673
-JIMMY:
How many do you follow?
-So many.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.275
But I'm paranoid if I cut one,

00:41.309 --> 00:42.910
I'm gonna miss out
on some really good stuff.

00:42.943 --> 00:44.178
Well, then don't unfollow any.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.713
But every time
I pick up my phone,

00:45.746 --> 00:47.748
it takes me, like, an hour
to scroll through everything.

00:47.781 --> 00:50.618
Longer if I get all horned up
in the middle.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.087
Yeah... No, actually,
it sounds like

00:53.121 --> 00:58.025
you're in a terrible dilemma,
about which I empathize fully.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.027
Aw, thanks, Jimmy.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
You see, I didn't try to fix
your problem, I just empathized,

01:02.096 --> 01:03.897
like you taught me, like a girl.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.766
I appreciate that.
I feel very heard.

01:05.799 --> 01:07.635
-Hmm.
-Now fix my problem.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.103
EDGAR:
So, hey.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.938
You know how you guys have been
visiting wedding planners,

01:10.971 --> 01:13.040
and no one's lived up
to your standards?

01:13.073 --> 01:14.875
-We think we know why.
-Because we've been

01:14.908 --> 01:17.211
lying to them
for our own amusement?

01:17.245 --> 01:21.249
Great work, Eugène François
Vidocq, first private detective

01:21.282 --> 01:23.317
-and father
of modern criminology.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.453
Jimmy, please!
We're talking.

01:25.486 --> 01:29.390
It's because
they don't know you.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.925
Because we've been lying
to them.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.995
Really, Edgar, what part of...?

01:37.831 --> 01:40.100
Who better to plan
the most important day

01:40.134 --> 01:44.272
of your lives than the two most
important people in your lives?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.807
LINDSAY: So, first of all,
we were thinking something like

01:46.840 --> 01:49.343
August 7... think about it:

01:49.377 --> 01:51.945
midpoint of summer,
clear of any holidays.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.614
9/11 is just around the corner.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.583
Isn't August 7 your birthday?

01:55.616 --> 01:59.019
I know it's Charlize Theron's.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.656
Huh! Weird, it's mine, too.

02:02.690 --> 02:06.527
Spitballing here--
what if we combine celebrations?

02:06.560 --> 02:08.562
There's not going to be
a wedding.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.867
! No.
-This is your natural
goddamn end point

02:13.901 --> 02:15.503
-we're working toward here...
-You guys cannot break up again.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.371
It's like we keep doing
the same thing over and over,

02:17.405 --> 02:18.472
and it's too much for my heart.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.107
You're like two ruined ladies
from the past...

02:20.140 --> 02:22.210
You're the pin in my grenade,
and you do not want

02:22.243 --> 02:23.811
-to pull that pin!
-...so close to having
the birthday of my dreams.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.779
Oh, my God, shut up.

02:25.813 --> 02:29.350
Look, we're getting married,
we're just not having a wedding.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.220
In, like...  ten hours.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.457
We're eloping, suckas!

02:36.490 --> 02:39.660
Wasting hella time with those
bunk-ass wedding planners

02:39.693 --> 02:41.795
made us realize we can just walk
right into the courthouse

02:41.829 --> 02:44.465
and do this damn thing like
we're paying a parking ticket.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.034
Oh, but that reminds me, I have,
like, 20 parking tickets to pay.

02:47.067 --> 02:50.838
Well, let's bring them.
Where are they?

02:52.072 --> 02:55.976
I can't believe
this is happening.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.147
Come on, let's go lay down.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.082
So, what you up to today,

03:02.115 --> 03:04.151
besides locking yourself down
a hunk?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.487
Coffee, e-mail...
might try to squeeze in

03:06.520 --> 03:08.055
a little nap before lunch. You?

03:08.088 --> 03:10.358
Oh, I've got my first meeting
for the movie adaptation

03:10.391 --> 03:11.759
of The Width of a Peach.

03:11.792 --> 03:15.263
So, I have to drive to the west
side, which is a whole thing.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.097
Ugh. Eat dicks, west.

03:17.130 --> 03:21.201
Oh, um... this came
in the post for you.

03:21.235 --> 03:26.374
Well, I am off. I shall return
a much maligned Hollywood elite.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.376
I'll see you at 4:30.

03:28.409 --> 03:29.777
Oh, we'll be right by
the two-dollar theater.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.211
They're showing
that Liam Neeson zeppelin movie.

03:31.245 --> 03:33.180
:
He wasn't asking for trouble.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.316
Trouble found him.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.590
*

03:47.395 --> 03:50.598
* I'm gonna leave you anyway *

03:50.631 --> 03:53.634
* I'm gonna
leave you anyway *

03:53.667 --> 03:55.102
* I'm gonna leave you anyway. *

04:13.587 --> 04:14.888
Sir...

04:22.095 --> 04:24.332
It's finally happening.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.443
Called it, I called it!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.678
It's mine. I called it.

04:43.116 --> 04:47.355
Hot, hot, not.

04:47.388 --> 04:50.324
-Maybe without the braces.

04:50.358 --> 04:54.928
Has your office gotten bigger
or have I gotten smaller?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.030
Neither. I have had my eye
on this office for years,

04:57.064 --> 05:00.033
so I took advantage
of the current cultural climate

05:00.067 --> 05:02.370
and enacted
some personal reparations

05:02.403 --> 05:03.971
on behalf of women everywhere.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.606
You "Me Too-ed" a dude
for his office?

05:05.639 --> 05:09.377
You know it!
And here's the best part.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.346
Holy shit.

05:12.380 --> 05:14.882
A bathroom in an office?

05:14.915 --> 05:17.351
It's like Inception for pooping.

05:17.385 --> 05:20.354
Oh, and it has one
of those fancy Japanese toilets

05:20.388 --> 05:23.223
that washes your butt
when you forget how to wipe.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.525
-Ah!
-But, but...

05:24.558 --> 05:26.794
Prima nocta, bitch.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.429
I break him in.

05:38.439 --> 05:41.375
I really think you're going
to regret not having a wedding.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.210
Oh, my God, Lindsay.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.379
Just rent out a Chuck E. Cheese
or something.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.347
This isn't about
our birthday/wedding.

05:47.381 --> 05:51.184
I just wanted to tell you
marriage is hard.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.754
Your wedding day
is the one day it's fun.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.824
Seriously, it's all downhill
after the wedding.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.392
That's just gravity.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.394
You're gonna go against gravity?

06:00.428 --> 06:02.396
I don't think so,
Sandra Bullock,

06:02.430 --> 06:04.498
star of the hit film Gravity.

06:04.532 --> 06:06.567
-I want a party!

06:06.600 --> 06:07.735
Lindsay, stop.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.237
Eloping is fine
because the point

06:10.270 --> 06:12.272
is being hitched,
not getting hitched,

06:12.305 --> 06:15.208
and if you'd ever actually
been in love, you'd know that.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.044
Why

06:17.077 --> 06:18.412
Because when you divorced Paul,

06:18.446 --> 06:20.581
you told me
you'd never been in love.

06:20.614 --> 06:24.452
Okay, whatever.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.186
I have to go to day work.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.422
You forgot your dry cleaning.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.190
It's not my dry cleaning.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.026
It's actually a wedding dress
I stole for you from work.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.463
I brought it in case
you didn't want to look shitty

06:35.496 --> 06:37.731
at your fake-ass non-wedding.

06:41.935 --> 06:45.238
-I called it!

06:45.272 --> 06:50.077
No, we just wanted to thank you
for speaking out about Ryan.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.648
Ryan

06:54.682 --> 06:56.283
He really was a harasser?

06:56.316 --> 06:59.587
U-Um, yeah.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.256
Anyway, thanks. You're a hero.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.295
I am a hero.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.468
We're just so excited, Jimmy.

07:14.502 --> 07:17.571
I still can't believe that my
book is being made into a movie.

07:17.605 --> 07:19.573
-Well, believe it.

07:19.607 --> 07:22.576
Oh, I absolutely believe it.
I was being folksy.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.444
This thing is getting
great reads all over town.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.813
We're starting to hear
takes next week.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.681
Takes? Oh, brilliant.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.017
And obviously, we'll run
the screenwriter by you,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.418
as a courtesy, you know.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.686
SHEILA:
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.955
And if you have any suggestions,

07:34.988 --> 07:36.790
we definitely want you
to feel heard.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.326
Wait, why would you
hire someone else

07:39.359 --> 07:41.595
to write the movie of my book?

07:41.629 --> 07:45.599
Uh...

07:45.633 --> 07:47.668
Great, you want to throw
your hat in the ring?

07:47.701 --> 07:48.669
That's fantastic.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.103
-Uh...
-DAN: Yeah.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.840
Why don't you come back in once
you've nailed down your take?

07:52.873 --> 07:54.274
-MAN: Dan.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.309
-Ooh, sorry, guys, I got to run.
-Ooh.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.111
Great seeing you, Jim.

07:58.145 --> 08:02.950
Uh, that must be that,
uh, big 1:00 meeting.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.418
I really should...

08:20.000 --> 08:21.501
What's a take?

08:26.840 --> 08:29.910
Stubborn bitch
is being such a stubborn bitch.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
She doesn't deserve that toilet.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.580
Lindsay, you're-you're
hurting my...

08:32.613 --> 08:34.514
She said I've never been
in love.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.149
How dare she criticize
my love life

08:36.183 --> 08:37.585
when she's eloping like a poor?

08:37.618 --> 08:38.886
This is bad, Lindsay.
Think about it.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.921
If they're cutting us
out of this, what's next?

08:40.954 --> 08:42.155
-Dog adoptions.

08:42.189 --> 08:43.356
-Shopping montages.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.225
-That dress was our last hope,

08:45.258 --> 08:46.560
and she didn't even look at it.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.729
Oh, this elopement
is a slippery slope.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.664
And we're sliding, Lindsay,
we're sliding fast.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.032
That's it.

08:52.065 --> 08:54.935
I have to convince him
to have a wedding.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.571
Oh, buddy.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.108
Oh, sweet, sweet buddy.

09:01.141 --> 09:04.612
-Oh, sweet, sweet, sweet...
!

09:04.645 --> 09:08.081
Edgar, Jimmy is smart.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.517
And you're, well, Edgar.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
I'm smart.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.956
I've been tricking Jimmy into
letting me live in his house

09:15.989 --> 09:17.457
for the last three years.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.759
Hate to break it to you,

09:18.792 --> 09:21.629
but you're the dumb one
of the group.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.131
What? No. You're the dumb one.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.332
-No, I'm the hot one.
-I'm the hot one.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.469
The reason you think

09:29.502 --> 09:31.138
someone else is the dumb one
of the group

09:31.171 --> 09:33.240
is because that's what
the dumb one's supposed to think

09:33.273 --> 09:34.775
to protect them,

09:34.808 --> 09:37.044
'cause if you were dumb and sad
at the same time,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.411
then you'd kill yourself.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.915
Now stick it back in me
somewhere, dummy.

09:46.654 --> 09:50.257
I'm not the dumb one,
you're the dumb one.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.826
JUSTINA :
Gretchen?

09:52.860 --> 09:55.829
Gretchen. Gretchen?

09:55.863 --> 10:00.067
Gretchen, are you okay?
Gretchen!

10:00.100 --> 10:02.269
-Gretchen, is
our session today?

10:02.302 --> 10:06.439
Oh, wait, literally no one cares
about anyone in Iowa.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.642
Anyway, I am eloping today.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.577
And you feel
conflicted about it?

10:10.610 --> 10:11.578
Uh, hell no.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.113
I feel great about it.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.648
They teach you
to jump to conclusions

10:14.682 --> 10:17.184
in titty
I'm sorry.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.019
-I know we're working on that.
-Thank you.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.789
I meant titty-sucking
bitch university!

10:21.822 --> 10:24.992
Oh! Goddamn it,
I am killing it today.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.694
Gretchen, I have work to do.

10:26.727 --> 10:31.264
So, I was 100
on this eloping thing,

10:31.298 --> 10:32.666
and then this box showed up

10:32.700 --> 10:36.169
with this dumb
wedding dream book

10:36.203 --> 10:38.638
I made as a kid.

10:38.672 --> 10:42.109
And I'm still
into eloping, I just...

10:42.142 --> 10:44.211
I don't know.

10:44.244 --> 10:47.514
I'm just mad pissed.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.516
-I told my simple-ass brother

10:49.549 --> 10:51.852
about this whole thing in
secret, and he went and blabbed

10:51.885 --> 10:53.787
to his depressed
postpartum sad wife.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.856
It's like, maybe focus
on keeping her

10:55.889 --> 10:58.025
from drowning my nephew,
you loose-lipped dickwad.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.061
Jesus Christ, Gretchen,
what is going on with you?

11:01.094 --> 11:03.396
It's this stupid book!

11:03.430 --> 11:04.898
And on top of that,

11:04.932 --> 11:06.533
Lindsay brought me
a wedding dress.

11:06.566 --> 11:10.070
It's like the universe
wants me to have a wedding?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.139
Sounds like you're more
in touch with what you want

11:12.172 --> 11:14.207
then you realize, and if you're
still having doubts...

11:14.241 --> 11:15.976
I should try the dress on?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.511
I was gonna say go for a run,
but sure, Gretchen,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.714
try on the dress
and see how you feel about it.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.815
Cool.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.717
I'm glad I figured that out.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.085
I'll Venmo myself ten bucks.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.187
It's $150.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.923
And you owe me
for three months.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.159
Anyways, I...  I hope
you and Boone figure it out.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.160
Who?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.595
Keep up, I'm marrying Jimmy.

11:35.628 --> 11:40.067
Gretchen, you listen
to me very carefully.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.402
Do not marry...

11:59.552 --> 12:01.454
Yeah, I feel nothing. Nice.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.378
-Oh!

12:29.783 --> 12:34.587
Yeah, I got 15 minutes.
Let's do this, toilet.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.665
How dare they make me audition

12:45.698 --> 12:48.335
to write the movie version
of my book?

12:48.368 --> 12:49.769
It's illogical

12:49.803 --> 12:51.171
and insulting.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.140
And if that's the way
that this industry works,

12:53.173 --> 12:55.775
then I shan't be party
to any of it.

12:55.809 --> 12:58.979
-No, I shan't indeed.
-Hey.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.314
Let's not talk shop today.

13:01.348 --> 13:04.818
Um, a toast. To your wedding.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.820
-Since we won't actually

13:06.854 --> 13:09.122
-be there, I just want to say...
-Edgar, Edgar,

13:09.156 --> 13:12.292
Edgar, please, just save
yourself the mental exertion

13:12.325 --> 13:15.695
you can clearly ill afford.
We're not having a wedding.

13:15.728 --> 13:16.930
-No, but you...
-Moreover,

13:16.964 --> 13:19.099
if you truly knew us,

13:19.132 --> 13:22.302
you would understand the
heterodox iconoclastic nature

13:22.335 --> 13:24.471
of a spontaneous elopement

13:24.504 --> 13:28.175
perfectly captures the renegade
tale of our amorous union.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.778
-So just save it.
-Ugh, fine.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.947
I did bring you here
to convince you to have

13:33.981 --> 13:35.949
a real wedding,

13:35.983 --> 13:38.318
but you painted such a beautiful
word salad just now,

13:38.351 --> 13:41.288
I've changed my mind.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.858
I guess Lindsay was right--
I am the dumb one of the group.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.695
Well, I guess eloping
does make sense

13:48.728 --> 13:50.797
considering all the people
whose weddings you've heckled

13:50.830 --> 13:53.466
over the years who'd just
show up to bring you down.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.004
Please!
I am un-bring-down-able.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.405
Nah, but weddings aren't.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.707
Remember what you did
to Becca and Vernon's?

14:00.740 --> 14:02.509
Ugh, what a low-rent,

14:02.542 --> 14:04.211
tacky affair.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.247
I mean, the horrid music,
the wretched decor,

14:07.280 --> 14:08.982
-my God, the food.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.817
There was nary a burrata bar
to be seen.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.587
Ooh, what kind of food
would you have?

14:14.621 --> 14:18.926
Oh, well, my wedding would be
catered by Roy Choi,

14:18.959 --> 14:21.594
-obviously.
-Oh, man, I love him.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.030
The flowers would have

14:23.063 --> 14:26.934
to be sourced same-day
from the flower mart, of course.

14:26.967 --> 14:30.570
Color palette:
Claude Monet, Rouen Cathedral,

14:30.603 --> 14:34.574
West Facade, Sunlight, 1892.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.710
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.247
Day of the event, fade in.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.550
It's dawn at Adamson House,

14:43.583 --> 14:46.286
and the fog is dense
over the Pacific Ocean,

14:46.319 --> 14:48.956
like a perfect
Christmas pudding.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.012
Omakase?

15:22.189 --> 15:25.192
I'll have what I'm having.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.674
And then a tasteful fireworks
display over the ocean,

15:41.708 --> 15:45.912
scored to Mahler's Ich bin der
Welt abhanden gekommen,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.982
would bring to a close
the greatest wedding

15:49.016 --> 15:51.518
in the history of matrimony.

15:51.551 --> 15:56.356
Resetting the very bar
to which all couples aspire.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.458
As espoused by Will Smith

15:58.491 --> 16:01.828
as Alex "Hitch" Hitchens
in Hitch,

16:01.861 --> 16:05.932
"Life is not the amount
of breaths you take,

16:05.965 --> 16:09.536
it's the moments
that take your breath away."

16:09.569 --> 16:12.039
ALL:
Oh...

16:12.072 --> 16:14.474
That shit was beautiful, bro.

16:14.507 --> 16:15.875
So when's this wedding?

16:15.908 --> 16:18.545
Oh, that was all hypothetical,
lowly barkeep.

16:18.578 --> 16:23.316
In fact, my fiancée and I
are eloping at...

16:23.350 --> 16:26.186
-...45 minutes ago.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.620
Oh, dear God!

16:27.654 --> 16:29.956
-Jimmy, no. Jimmy.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.659
She thinks I've abandoned her.
Again.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.227
Oh, no, Jimmy.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.462
I guess you have no choice

16:35.495 --> 16:38.765
but to throw a real wedding.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.603
Oh, God.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.383
This is my fault.
This was my plan all along.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.452
Well, not this. Just the part
where I bamboozle you

17:32.485 --> 17:34.221
into wanting a real wedding.

17:34.254 --> 17:36.123
I didn't mean for you to leave
Gretchen at the non-altar.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.460
-I'm too powerful, Jimmy.
-Yeah, right.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.562
We've already established
that you're the dumb one.

17:42.595 --> 17:43.963
Nice try, though, dummy.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.032
Quick, give me a tube sock
and some nickels.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.867
I'll work you over,
basic training style,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.437
and Gretchen will think you got
jumped outside City Hall.

17:50.470 --> 17:54.207
Edgar, that is moronic.
What kind of demented idiot

17:54.241 --> 17:55.908
would agree
to something like that?

17:55.942 --> 17:57.310
Do it.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.757
Damn it, Gretchen! Stay still.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.892
-This is really hard for me.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.995
I'm sorry, I thought I'd long
ago lost my survival instinct,

18:16.028 --> 18:19.766
along with my gag reflex.
Oh, goddamn it!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.434
I can't believe
I missed my wedding.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.436
What the fuck is wrong with me?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.138
Gretchen, Gretchen.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.106
I know this seems
like a giant deal now,

18:27.140 --> 18:30.177
but in a few years,
when you and Jimmy are...

18:30.210 --> 18:32.612
Oh! Oh, no! Gretchen,

18:32.645 --> 18:35.081
I thought surprising you would
work, but it worked too good.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.416
I...

18:36.449 --> 18:37.450
-Again.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.652
No.
Honey, once was hard enough.

18:39.686 --> 18:40.920
I-I couldn't possibly...

18:42.655 --> 18:44.123
That's for saying
I've never been in love.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.359
Oh, Jesus, but it's true!

18:48.795 --> 18:51.698
Stop! Lindsay! Safe word!

19:08.748 --> 19:10.049
How do I look?

19:10.082 --> 19:13.186
Like Mickey Rourke
was stung by bees.

19:13.220 --> 19:14.187
Perfect.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.857
Sorry I said the thing
about you never being in love.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.159
It's okay. It's true.

19:20.193 --> 19:23.530
Just hurts to hear it out loud.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.507
Oh, no.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.609
My Snapple was in there.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.429
I don't smell smoke.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.701
And her car's not here.

20:37.670 --> 20:39.572
Oh, I... I guess
we're safe for now.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.208
I wonder if there's a way
that we can convince her

20:42.241 --> 20:44.444
that you manipulated me
into missing the wedding?

20:44.477 --> 20:47.246
Oh, you mean
my plan I actually did?

20:47.280 --> 20:51.083
Yeah, but in my fictitious
version, it worked.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.387
JIMMY:
Okay, listen, Gretchen,

20:54.421 --> 20:56.055
I can...
Oh, my God!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.124
What happened?!

20:58.157 --> 21:00.993
:
Oh, Jimmy, I'm still shaking.

21:01.027 --> 21:04.263
I got in an insane accident.

21:04.297 --> 21:07.334
Like, an inch away
from being decapitated,

21:07.367 --> 21:10.837
Final Destination insane.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.672
Oh, Jesus, are... are you hurt?

21:12.705 --> 21:15.508
Yeah, but I guess I deserve it.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.945
Oh, Gretchen, I'm so, so sorry.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.314
Listen, the-the last thing
I'd want you to think is

21:21.348 --> 21:24.116
that I'd abandoned you... again.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.319
And, uh,
it's been absolutely killing me.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.087
Wait. You didn't show up?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.590
I mean, you didn't show up.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.692
You didn't show up!

21:32.725 --> 21:35.127
Oh, what is wrong with you?

21:35.161 --> 21:38.998
You left me standing there
in this dress?

21:39.031 --> 21:41.701
Do you know how stupid I looked?

21:41.734 --> 21:44.337
Do you know
how humiliated I was?

21:44.371 --> 21:45.972
I'm so, so sorry.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.541
You left me standing there,

21:48.575 --> 21:50.843
waiting for you

21:50.877 --> 21:52.945
on the street!

21:52.979 --> 21:56.949
Crying like
I'm in some bad movie.

21:56.983 --> 22:01.621
All the other couples in line
were laughing at me!

22:01.654 --> 22:05.124
A homeless man hugged me

22:05.157 --> 22:07.193
'cause he felt so bad!

22:09.829 --> 22:12.799
What is wrong with you, Jimmy?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.634
What...?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.369
Oh, Gretchen.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.371
You just couldn't
help yourself, could you?

22:18.405 --> 22:20.573
What are you talking about?

22:20.607 --> 22:23.342
You little ginger fool. You say

22:23.376 --> 22:25.912
you were "waiting on the street"

22:25.945 --> 22:28.981
because you imagined City Hall

22:29.015 --> 22:31.418
was just some sort of kiosk

22:31.451 --> 22:33.386
or storefront, didn't you?

22:33.420 --> 22:34.821
No. I...

22:34.854 --> 22:36.322
Because you've never been there.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.357
Not to pay a parking ticket,

22:38.391 --> 22:40.393
not to get married.

22:40.427 --> 22:43.430
You didn't show up either!

22:43.463 --> 22:46.165
Yes, I did. Why would I be
wearing this dress

22:46.198 --> 22:48.501
-See, when I mistakenly

22:48.535 --> 22:51.404
drank through
our City Hall wedding,

22:51.438 --> 22:55.742
Edgar's first instinct was
to use his penchant for violence

22:55.775 --> 22:58.911
to make it look as though
I was set upon by ruffians.

22:58.945 --> 23:03.349
Now something tells me, as
the twin dummies of the group,

23:03.382 --> 23:05.418
Lindsay had
a similar moronic idea.

23:05.452 --> 23:07.954
It was my moronic idea!

23:07.987 --> 23:10.557
Mm. Uh...

23:10.590 --> 23:12.425
Fine.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.126
I missed it, too.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.364
-Sit down, Gretchen.
-No.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.800
-Oh, come on.
We can figure this out.
-No.

23:20.833 --> 23:24.270
I know. I just can't sit down
right now.

23:24.303 --> 23:25.705
I missed the wedding

23:25.738 --> 23:27.440
'cause I was banging
my new toilet.

23:27.474 --> 23:30.076
It's a long story.

23:30.109 --> 23:31.444
Actually, it's not.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.079
I just said the whole thing.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.083
So, neither of us showed.

23:38.485 --> 23:42.288
Do you think
there's some deeper meaning?

23:48.761 --> 23:52.198
Gretchen Cutler's Wedding Diary.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.802
I think I want a wedding.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.904
A wedding

23:57.937 --> 23:59.639
He wants one, too!

23:59.672 --> 24:02.475
Tell her about the fog, Jimmy.
The Christmas fog.

24:02.509 --> 24:04.611
Oh.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.938
YOUNG GRETCHEN:
Dear Gretchen,

24:31.971 --> 24:34.541
if you're watching this,
it's because I died.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.442
Just kidding!

24:36.475 --> 24:38.511
It's because
we're getting married!

24:38.545 --> 24:41.047
If everything's gone
according to the plan,

24:41.080 --> 24:44.050
you're a hot 22-year-old
marine biologist

24:44.083 --> 24:46.886
who's engaged
to Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.521
22.

24:48.555 --> 24:51.023
-YOUNG GRETCHEN: He's so cute.
-You're no JTT, pal.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.693
Okay. So this is
the must-have section.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.662
A French lace gown
with a ten-foot train,

24:55.695 --> 24:57.163
a chocolate fountain.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.831
New Kids on the Block
will perform.

24:58.865 --> 25:00.232
For the complete list, refer

25:00.266 --> 25:02.001
to the must-haves section
in our book.

25:05.572 --> 25:09.909
I know it sounds fun, but
marriage can be really scary.

25:09.942 --> 25:13.045
So, if you ever get nervous,
just remember

25:13.079 --> 25:15.181
you're making me really happy.

25:15.214 --> 25:18.250
And don't forget
to run everything by Mom,

25:18.284 --> 25:19.819
or you'll have to eat dinner

25:19.852 --> 25:22.054
in the scary room for bad girls
under the stairs.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.860
So should we pick a date?

25:27.894 --> 25:30.597
-August 7 is a nice...
-GRETCHEN and JIMMY: No.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.065
("Baldy" by Mozes
and the Firstborn playing)

25:33.099 --> 25:35.101
(Young Gretchen continues
speaking indistinctly)

25:58.090 --> 25:59.558
Ah.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.994
