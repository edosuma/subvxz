He worked with us,

39:06.638 --> 39:08.515
he explored with us,

39:10.142 --> 39:13.395
he celebrated alongside us in victory,

39:15.105 --> 39:18.650

any of this on his own...

I have it in a stasis field right now,
but if there's any kind of a power surge

51:26.712 --> 51:29.590
or gravitational anomaly,
it could destabilize it.

51:29.590 --> 51:32.926
We've been lucky so far, but if we
want to do something, it's gotta be soon.

51:32.926 --> 51:34.428
- You mean revive him?

51:35.971 --> 51:37.806
This is subatomic technology.

51:37.806 --> 51:40.017
The ship's computer
would have to do that, right?

51:40.017 --> 51:41.435
- That's exactly why it can't.

51:41.435 --> 51:44.479
This is way smaller
than the smallest nanotech we have.

51:44.479 --> 51:47.816
I wouldn't trust the computer
to stay ahead of any surprises.

51:47.816 --> 51:51.236
What we need is the intuitive power
of a biological brain,

51:51.236 --> 51:55.032
along with the visualization capacity
to work in multiple dimensions.

51:55.991 --> 51:57.242
- Charly...

52:13.300 --> 52:14.927
- If it was anyone other than you,

52:14.927 --> 52:17.054
I'd suspect this was
some kind of sick joke.

52:17.054 --> 52:19.389
- Look, I know this isn't easy,

52:19.389 --> 52:24.228
but you have a gift that comes along
maybe once in a generation.

52:24.228 --> 52:27.523
No one else has your capacity
for dimensional visualization.

52:27.523 --> 52:29.358
So I am asking for your help.

52:29.358 --> 52:31.527
- We have a dead Kaylon.

52:31.527 --> 52:33.612
And you want me to help
bring him back to life?

52:33.612 --> 52:34.571
- Yes.

52:34.571 --> 52:37.407
- Okay, how 'bout this:

52:37.407 --> 52:40.911
I'll do it if he can
bring back Amanda. Deal?

52:40.911 --> 52:42.246
- Look, Ensign, try to see--

52:42.246 --> 52:43.705
- No. No way.

52:45.707 --> 52:49.044
I'm sorry, Captain,
but I'm not gonna do it.

52:49.044 --> 52:52.256
He's dead and he deserves to be dead.

52:55.217 --> 52:57.469
- He was a member of this crew.

52:57.469 --> 53:00.055
Some would say
that makes you duty-bound.

53:01.181 --> 53:02.850
- Yeah, some would say.

53:04.434 --> 53:07.771
- So your willingness
to assist a fellow crewman

53:07.771 --> 53:11.108
depends on your personal feelings
at the time?

53:12.734 --> 53:16.154
- It depends on whether
they've murdered people I know, yeah.

53:16.738 --> 53:18.615
Other than that, I'm happy to help.

53:18.615 --> 53:21.368
- Look, Isaac is our only link
to the Kaylon--

53:21.368 --> 53:22.995
- With all due respect, Captain,

53:22.995 --> 53:25.163
I don't know what you think
you're gonna get out of him--

53:25.163 --> 53:28.041

that changes the entire game?

53:28.041 --> 53:29.418
It hasn't happened!

53:29.418 --> 53:31.879
What has happened is that
they've killed thousands of people!

53:45.934 --> 53:47.769

you're not the only one
who lost friends in that battle.

53:52.065 --> 53:54.693

when it comes to the psychological
well-being of this crew?

1:05:24.591 --> 1:05:25.801
- Yes.

1:05:25.801 --> 1:05:29.680
- And do you acknowledge,
when it comes to human behavior,

1:05:29.680 --> 1:05:35.060
that my judgment as a medical professional
is superior to yours?

1:05:35.060 --> 1:05:36.103
- Yes.

1:05:36.103 --> 1:05:41.358
- Then it is only logical for you
to accept my assertion

1:05:41.358 --> 1:05:44.653
that the psychological damage
to this crew

1:05:44.653 --> 1:05:49.950
would be much greater if you
succeeded in taking your own life.

1:05:50.951 --> 1:05:52.703
- Your reasoning is sound.

1:05:52.703 --> 1:05:53.871
- Isaac...

1:05:53.871 --> 1:05:57.958
you arrived at your decision
based on your analysis

1:05:57.958 --> 1:06:00.043
of all currently available data.

1:06:00.043 --> 1:06:04.840
But what you didn't take into account
is the possibility of change.

1:06:04.840 --> 1:06:07.426
You don't know how this crew
is going to feel

1:06:07.426 --> 1:06:09.803
a year or even a month from now.

1:06:09.803 --> 1:06:13.098
- I did not apply that data,
as it is unavailable at this time.

1:06:13.098 --> 1:06:14.433
- That's my point!

1:06:14.433 --> 1:06:17.644
People who try to take their own lives

1:06:17.644 --> 1:06:21.565
are unable to distinguish the future
from the present.

1:06:21.565 --> 1:06:27.196
There is no problem so immense
that it can't be solved in time.

1:06:27.196 --> 1:06:29.489
- It would appear so.

1:06:29.489 --> 1:06:32.534
How soon shall I expect this change
among the crew?

1:06:32.534 --> 1:06:34.786
- You're a Kaylon.

1:06:34.786 --> 1:06:38.248
Your people would like to see us all dead.

1:06:38.248 --> 1:06:43.337
But you're also a person,
and you're here with us.

1:06:43.837 --> 1:06:47.216
And it's a lot harder to hate
from up close.

1:06:48.383 --> 1:06:49.843
Look...

1:06:52.304 --> 1:06:54.848
I just need to know
that you're going to be safe.

1:06:55.432 --> 1:07:00.395
If at any time in the future
you have these thoughts,

1:07:00.395 --> 1:07:02.856
you come to me!

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:07.528
Do you promise?

1:07:09.029 --> 1:07:11.281
- I... promise.

1:07:13.825 --> 1:07:15.619
- Good.

1:07:15.619 --> 1:07:17.746
- Has our session concluded?

1:07:19.957 --> 1:07:21.625
- I guess it has.

1:07:24.586 --> 1:07:25.879
Isaac.

1:07:29.925 --> 1:07:32.094
I'm glad you're still here.

1:07:33.011 --> 1:07:34.680
- Thank you, Doctor.
