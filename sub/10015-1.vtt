00:27.268 --> 00:29.267
That fair her seems...

00:29.717 --> 00:32.797
That fair her seems the
less ye see her may.

00:33.507 --> 00:36.826
Lo see soon after how...

00:44.614 --> 00:46.334
Modesty.

00:46.434 --> 00:48.524
There are things that she'll see.

00:48.624 --> 00:53.303
Lo see soon after how... more
bold and free her bared bosom...

01:02.071 --> 01:03.929
A see the virgin rose...
How sweetly she...

01:04.029 --> 01:05.620
...doth peep forth
with bashful modesty.

01:05.720 --> 01:08.700
There can be no
doubt about his sex.

01:08.950 --> 01:11.609
Despite the feminine
appearance that...

01:11.659 --> 01:14.599
...every young man at
the time aspires to.

01:14.729 --> 01:17.788
And there can be no doubt
about his upbringing.

01:17.888 --> 01:18.878
Good food.

01:18.978 --> 01:20.208
Education.

01:20.307 --> 01:21.217
A nanny.

01:21.317 --> 01:23.927
Loneliness and isolation.

01:25.077 --> 01:27.886
And...because this is England...

01:28.186 --> 01:30.656
Orlando would therefore
seem destined...

01:30.756 --> 01:32.785
...to have his
portrait on the wall.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.964
And his name in the history books.

01:36.434 --> 01:38.434
But when he...

01:38.624 --> 01:39.714
That is...

01:39.814 --> 01:41.183
I

01:41.283 --> 01:43.533
Came into the world.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.232
He was looking for something else.

01:47.272 --> 01:51.661
Though heir to a name that meant
power, land and property...

01:52.201 --> 01:54.831
Surely when Orlando was born...

01:54.981 --> 01:57.430
...it wasn't privilege he sought...

01:57.720 --> 01:59.910
...but company.

More wine my lord?

06:51.693 --> 06:54.472
A see the virgin rose.

06:54.472 --> 06:57.372
How sweetly she doth
first peep forth

06:57.372 --> 06:59.551
With bashful modesty.

07:00.041 --> 07:03.271
That fair her seems the
less ye see her may.

07:03.630 --> 07:06.200
Lo see soon after how..

07:06.200 --> 07:11.199
more bold and free her bared
bosom she doth broad display

07:11.519 --> 07:15.068
Lo see soon after how she fades...

07:15.728 --> 07:17.228
...and falls away.

07:17.328 --> 07:19.327
so passeth in th..

07:19.767 --> 07:22.027
Is this a worthy topic?

07:22.107 --> 07:26.716
From one so clearly in
the bloom of youth.

07:26.806 --> 07:30.015
To one who would desire it still?

07:30.995 --> 07:34.494
Fair virgo gratious majesty,

07:34.494 --> 07:38.134
Your bloom is legendary,

07:38.134 --> 07:42.013
and these were of course not
the sentiments of our son,

07:42.013 --> 07:44.013
but of a poet.

07:44.203 --> 07:47.172
Now what would please you?

07:47.472 --> 07:51.741
All that is mine is
here for your pleasure.

07:51.791 --> 07:56.260
All you call yours is mine already.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.582
Come.

08:34.683 --> 08:36.682
Your leg.

08:50.100 --> 08:54.069
I want you here in England with me.

08:54.239 --> 08:57.748
You will be the son
of my old age...

08:57.748 --> 09:00.968
...and the limb of my infirmity.

09:01.238 --> 09:03.307
My favourite.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.507
My mascot.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.554
Come.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.638
Aah, this is my victory.

10:48.617 --> 10:52.066
Come, your handsome leg.

11:06.253 --> 11:10.252
For you and for your heirs Orlando.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.612
The house.

11:13.112 --> 11:15.111
Your Majesty.

11:15.671 --> 11:17.141
I'm forever i...

11:17.241 --> 11:19.701
But on one condition.

11:20.390 --> 11:22.560
Do not fade.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.819
Do not wither.

11:26.409 --> 11:30.019
Do not grow old.

11:51.084 --> 11:53.404
Very interesting person.

12:39.705 --> 12:43.144
First the queen and now his father.

12:43.244 --> 12:45.364
It is too sad.

12:45.534 --> 12:47.773
Mourning so becomes him.

12:48.103 --> 12:50.493
One can quite see why
he was the favourite.

12:50.593 --> 12:52.702
My dear friends how can you?

12:52.762 --> 12:55.052
In his time of grief.

13:56.380 --> 13:58.380
That way.

14:29.813 --> 14:31.813
Sasha.

14:51.789 --> 14:53.559
Who's that?

14:53.659 --> 14:57.718
I believe she is the daughter
of the muscovite ambassador.

14:57.798 --> 14:59.798
How the delightful.

15:00.877 --> 15:02.877
If that's to your taste.

15:03.267 --> 15:04.987
What ever can you mean?

15:05.087 --> 15:08.796
Oh, smearing themselves with
candle wax to keep warm.

15:09.106 --> 15:11.785
Wearing beards as they get
older, that kind of thing.

15:11.885 --> 15:14.095
Perhaps in this you're
mistaken, Moray.

15:14.195 --> 15:16.544
Told me on good authority
by Lord Francis Vere.

15:16.644 --> 15:17.914
Does he travel to muscovite.

15:18.014 --> 15:20.014
He knows someone who did.

15:20.064 --> 15:22.063
Aah.

15:56.147 --> 15:59.056
This is the Lady Euphrosyne.

15:59.496 --> 16:01.496
The Lord Winchelsea.

16:02.675 --> 16:04.685
The Lord Orlando.

16:05.695 --> 16:06.854
The Earl of Moray.

16:06.954 --> 16:08.954
Moray....

16:09.674 --> 16:12.253
And I am Lord Francis Vere.

16:12.353 --> 16:13.993
Ochin Liesna.

16:14.093 --> 16:16.093
Sorry?
- Enchanté.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.452
Enchanted.
- Aah.

16:21.272 --> 16:24.271
And my name is
Alexandra Menchikova.

16:24.371 --> 16:26.811
But my father calls me Sasha.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.310
Enchanté.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.130
Here doing some quail.

16:32.230 --> 16:33.709
Spasiba.

16:33.809 --> 16:35.839
Do they have quail in Russia?

16:36.319 --> 16:38.168
Do you speak French?

16:38.268 --> 16:40.268
A little.

16:41.168 --> 16:43.970
But the most Englishmen
can't, or do...

16:44.070 --> 16:46.660
...not want to speak
other languages.

16:47.027 --> 16:50.176
How do they communicate
with strangers then?

16:51.146 --> 16:53.145
They speak English louder.

16:53.605 --> 16:55.965
Please tell the
ambassador that this,

16:56.065 --> 17:00.994
great frost is the most severe ever
to have visited these islands.

17:01.664 --> 17:05.226
Erh, tell him that in
Norfolk a young country...

17:05.326 --> 17:08.545
...woman was seen to turn
visibly to powder...

17:08.582 --> 17:13.311
...and was blown away in a
puff of dust in the icy blast.

17:14.421 --> 17:16.421
Most amusing.

18:15.899 --> 18:21.848
Don't worry my dear, this absurd
affection will not last the season.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.648
After all..

18:23.748 --> 18:25.747
She's a foreigner.

19:13.898 --> 19:17.387
My Lord Orlando, you're in
danger of becoming a fool.

19:17.487 --> 19:19.679
You're ruining what
could be the finest...

19:19.779 --> 19:21.437
...career in the land and for what?

19:21.536 --> 19:24.056
I no longer care
for a career, Moray.

19:24.086 --> 19:26.136
I'm only interested in love.

19:26.775 --> 19:29.642
Don't you see in courting
a Cossack, you're...

19:29.742 --> 19:31.974
...humiliating not
only your fiancé...

19:32.074 --> 19:35.714
...but the entire female
population of this country.

19:36.424 --> 19:38.733
Besides which, they have nothing.

19:38.963 --> 19:41.063
Why do you think they're here?

20:22.765 --> 20:24.566
For your sake I would
hunt wolf instead of...

20:24.666 --> 20:26.304
...rabbit drinking vodka
instead of whiskey.

20:26.404 --> 20:27.384
How generous.

20:27.484 --> 20:29.603
As for marriage to the good
Lady Euphrosyne the thing is...

20:29.703 --> 20:31.603
...so probably absurd that I
scarcely give it a thought.

20:31.703 --> 20:32.683
How gallant.

20:32.783 --> 20:35.700
I feel as if I've been hooked
through the nose and rushed...

20:35.800 --> 20:38.372
...through the waters painfully
yet with my own consent.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.471
How brave.

20:45.120 --> 20:48.969
My Lord, have you quite
forgotten that we are betrothed?

20:48.969 --> 20:51.629
My Lady, I'm being
constantly reminded.

20:51.649 --> 20:53.719
You speak so lightly of it.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.518
You've betrayed me.

20:57.218 --> 20:59.217
The treachery of men.

21:05.886 --> 21:08.326
It would never have worked.

21:09.215 --> 21:11.215
A man must follow his heart.

22:00.346 --> 22:02.345
There.

22:02.945 --> 22:04.135
Where you live?

22:04.235 --> 22:06.234
I do.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.524
By yourself?

22:09.754 --> 22:11.753
Well, yes.

22:12.333 --> 22:14.333
At the moment.

22:20.332 --> 22:21.881
No brother?

22:21.981 --> 22:24.251
No sister?

22:26.910 --> 22:29.200
You Sasha?

22:30.510 --> 22:33.169
If I had brother I
wouldn't be here.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.909
My father only has me.

23:17.081 --> 23:19.670
Nothing thicker than
a knifes blade...

23:19.718 --> 23:22.180
...separates melancholy
from happiness.

23:22.280 --> 23:24.739
Why are you sad?

23:26.199 --> 23:28.198
Because.

23:30.658 --> 23:33.887
Because I can't bear
this happiness to end.

23:34.207 --> 23:36.437
But we are together.

23:37.177 --> 23:39.176
Yes, now.

23:39.306 --> 23:41.166
But what about tomorrow?

23:41.266 --> 23:43.265
And the day after?

23:44.665 --> 23:46.365
Orlando.

23:46.465 --> 23:48.804
I think you suffer from
a strange melancholy.

23:48.904 --> 23:51.564
Which is, you suffer in advance.

23:52.874 --> 23:55.363
Look at me. Look.

24:00.682 --> 24:03.042
You are too serious, Orlando.

24:03.931 --> 24:06.661
And yet not serious enough.

25:09.689 --> 25:13.088
Shadows, you saw shadows.
- You were in his arms.

25:13.088 --> 25:15.947
It was illusion in light.
- Then what were you doing?

25:16.047 --> 25:19.347
He was taking me across deck.
- But I saw you.

25:19.347 --> 25:21.586
May gods destroy me, if I family

25:21.668 --> 25:24.258
Menchikov would lie
in arm of sailor.

25:26.295 --> 25:28.295
Sasha.

25:28.455 --> 25:31.614
I cannot think of
a life without you.

25:32.004 --> 25:33.624
Stay with me.

25:33.724 --> 25:36.763
Don't ever go.
- But it's impossible.

25:37.443 --> 25:38.803
But why?

25:38.903 --> 25:40.972
Because when ice breaks we must go.

25:41.072 --> 25:43.412
But we're linked.

25:43.942 --> 25:46.591
Our destinies are linked.

25:48.241 --> 25:49.911
You're mine.

25:50.011 --> 25:52.010
Why?

25:52.200 --> 25:54.840
Because I adore you.

25:55.670 --> 25:58.459
Meet me at midnight
at London bridge.

25:58.769 --> 26:01.898
We'll fly away as free as birds.

26:01.998 --> 26:05.328
Lots of air, very fresh.

26:06.527 --> 26:08.527
There.

26:08.527 --> 26:11.167
It's decided.

26:15.916 --> 26:20.425
your lessons, speak now his
now his a lot with peace within

26:20.425 --> 26:22.424
Speak of me as I am.

26:23.154 --> 26:27.933
Nothing extenuates nor
sits down aught in malice.

26:33.582 --> 26:35.452
Then speak of one.

26:35.552 --> 26:38.251
Who loved lord wisely but to well

26:38.251 --> 26:41.731
But one whom not easily jealous

26:41.731 --> 26:44.740
But being wrought,
perplexed in the extreme

26:45.150 --> 26:48.749
Of one whose hand, like
the base Indian...

26:48.869 --> 26:50.959
...threw a pearl away.

26:51.059 --> 26:54.318
worth more than all his tribe.

26:58.797 --> 27:01.677
I kissed thee ear. I killed thee.

27:01.777 --> 27:03.926
No way but this.

27:04.636 --> 27:06.636
By killing myself...

27:06.756 --> 27:10.035
To die upon a kiss.

27:14.024 --> 27:16.024
Terrific play.

27:56.746 --> 27:59.725
She will. She will be here.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.333
Help. Help.

29:34.697 --> 29:37.016
The treachery of women.

29:51.024 --> 29:53.023
Ehm, ehm.

29:56.323 --> 29:58.322
Ehm.

30:16.299 --> 30:18.298
Good morning.

30:20.658 --> 30:23.667
It's now time to awake.

30:24.597 --> 30:27.906
To such a fine morning.

30:30.886 --> 30:34.495
From such a long refreshing sleep.

30:37.875 --> 30:42.554
Six days you say?
- Tomorrow will be the seventh.

30:48.272 --> 30:56.711
♪ This pleasing
shining wondrous day. ♪

31:12.378 --> 31:14.027
The Lord Orlando...

31:14.127 --> 31:16.127
...is sleeping.

31:25.585 --> 31:29.554
I can find only three words
to describe the female sex.

31:34.124 --> 31:36.693
None of which are worth expressing.

31:43.392 --> 31:47.891
When in disgrace with
fortune and men's eyes.

31:48.761 --> 31:52.820
I all alone be weep
my outcast state.

31:54.300 --> 31:56.339
and trouble heaven...

31:56.439 --> 31:59.129
...with my bootless cries.

32:00.748 --> 32:02.998
and look upon myself...

32:03.738 --> 32:06.047
...and curse my fate.

32:13.406 --> 32:15.405
Aah.

32:15.845 --> 32:17.845
Poetry.

32:39.371 --> 32:41.370
Get off.

32:41.420 --> 32:42.310
Get off.

32:42.410 --> 32:44.410
Off. Off.

33:02.426 --> 33:04.426
Thank you.

33:08.165 --> 33:10.655
I was thinking.

33:11.984 --> 33:15.014
Sitting here, as we are.

33:17.233 --> 33:21.123
It's odd. Considering how
common the name of Greene is,

33:21.213 --> 33:23.802
that the Greene family came
over with the conquerer.

33:23.902 --> 33:25.902
And is in fact,

33:26.782 --> 33:28.551
from the highest
nobility in France.

33:28.651 --> 33:30.651
Oh.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.810
Oh, really?

33:35.280 --> 33:39.269
Unfortunately the Greens came
down in the world and erm..

33:39.469 --> 33:44.158
We've little more than leave our
name to the burrower of Greenwich.

33:44.338 --> 33:48.677
And now Mr Greene to the subject
closer to my heart and yours.

33:48.677 --> 33:50.917
The sacred subject of poetry.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.916
Aah.

33:53.406 --> 33:58.995
You know, I once broke a lady's fan
in my enthusiasm to find a rime.

33:59.515 --> 34:01.655
Enthusiasm can be dangerous.

34:02.255 --> 34:06.734
As a youth I was often mocked for
my love of poetry and solitude.

34:06.764 --> 34:08.763
Tragic.

34:09.223 --> 34:12.250
And of course Mr
Greene, your works...

34:12.350 --> 34:14.982
...hold pride of
place in my library.

34:14.982 --> 34:15.871
Uh-uh.

34:15.972 --> 34:18.440
To me there is a
certain glory about...

34:18.540 --> 34:20.621
...a man who can
express in words...

34:20.721 --> 34:24.840
...those great emotions
that others can only feel.

34:26.510 --> 34:27.489
Oh.

34:27.590 --> 34:31.789
You know I scarcely dared to
ask to make your acquaintance...

34:31.849 --> 34:35.277
...for I feel that I can
offer nothing in return.

34:35.328 --> 34:37.418
I'm sure that any
writer would be more...

34:37.518 --> 34:39.556
...than willing to
except your hospitality.

34:39.657 --> 34:41.657
Oh, do you think so?

34:41.777 --> 34:43.996
If we would speak of poetry...

34:44.716 --> 34:47.656
...then let us first
speak of poets lives.

34:47.716 --> 34:49.344
Do you know how
'Hamlet' was written?

34:49.445 --> 34:53.574
Written while bailiffs were
pounding on Shakespeare's door.

34:53.695 --> 34:56.264
No wonder so many of his
plays were falsey too.

34:56.364 --> 34:58.364
Aw, I'm sure you're right.

34:58.824 --> 35:03.233
How can a...How can a genius work
when he cannot pay the bills?

35:03.283 --> 35:05.022
When I say work...

35:05.122 --> 35:07.962
Erm, work you see... is...

35:09.442 --> 35:12.151
...people who haven't laboured
in this way don't understand...

35:12.251 --> 35:15.320
...that real poetry neither
easy nor easily produced.

35:15.420 --> 35:18.260
Then I feel that I can
understand a little Mr Greene.

35:18.360 --> 35:21.229
Because I have myself
been so righteous...

35:21.271 --> 35:23.791
...to attempt to
write some poems...

35:23.999 --> 35:27.318
Did I hear a mouse's squeak?

35:28.668 --> 35:30.008
I must say I didn't hear any.

35:30.107 --> 35:32.297
That's saying you're
in good health.

35:32.397 --> 35:37.006
My own my lord have been so bad
it's a marvel I'm still alive.

35:37.486 --> 35:41.575
I have an enlarged heart, a
spleen and a diseased liver.

35:43.525 --> 35:47.564
Above all there are sensations in
my spine which defy description.

35:47.664 --> 35:51.483
There is one nob about a third from
the top which burns like fire.

35:51.583 --> 35:55.133
Second from the
bottom...cold as ice.

35:55.183 --> 35:59.782
Sometimes I feel as if a
thousand wax tapers were alight.

35:59.852 --> 36:03.981
And people were throwing
fireworks inside my brain and I...

36:04.041 --> 36:06.040
I'm so sensitive.

36:06.140 --> 36:09.440
I can feel a rose leaf
through my mattress.

36:10.740 --> 36:12.419
In short.

36:12.519 --> 36:15.049
I'm a piece of machinery
so finely made...

36:15.149 --> 36:17.878
...and curiously put together...

36:18.078 --> 36:20.128
...that it confounds me to think

36:20.228 --> 36:23.567
That I've only sold
115 copies of my poem.

36:23.677 --> 36:25.915
But it has to be said this
is largely due to what...

36:26.015 --> 36:28.076
...can only be descried as
a conspiracy against me.

36:28.176 --> 36:30.400
But Mr Greene surely
your work is...

36:30.500 --> 36:32.785
...widely admired by
all the young poets?

36:32.885 --> 36:34.506
Including dare I say it...

36:34.606 --> 36:38.154
All young writers will turn
at any trash that will sell.

36:38.254 --> 36:39.834
It hurts me to say it.

36:39.934 --> 36:43.273
For I love literature,
as I love life.

36:44.093 --> 36:47.162
But the art of poetry
is dead in England.

36:48.822 --> 36:51.162
You think so?

36:51.252 --> 36:53.251
Of course... erhm...

36:53.821 --> 36:55.641
That I have pension...

36:55.741 --> 36:57.530
...of...

36:57.630 --> 36:59.630
...300 pounds a year?

36:59.900 --> 37:01.380
paid...

37:01.480 --> 37:03.179
...quarterly...

37:03.279 --> 37:05.299
I'd live for literature alone..

37:05.399 --> 37:07.918
I'd dedicate myself
to fine writing.

37:09.088 --> 37:11.768
But...sadly...

37:11.768 --> 37:15.147
It's necessary to have
a pension to do it.

37:16.027 --> 37:18.026
About 300 pounds a year.

37:20.146 --> 37:22.146
Paid quarterly.

37:22.835 --> 37:25.113
Mr Greene, I wonder
would you be so kind...

37:25.213 --> 37:27.285
...as to give me your
opinion of my efforts?

37:27.385 --> 37:30.784
By all means... If
I can find the time.

37:31.234 --> 37:33.093
For time is money.

37:33.193 --> 37:35.293
And I must write to eat.

37:35.693 --> 37:37.610
We're not in the pursuit of art.

37:37.710 --> 37:41.592
Of course I will arrange for the
small matter of the 300 pounds.

37:41.692 --> 37:42.982
To be paid...

37:43.082 --> 37:44.031
Quarterly?

37:44.131 --> 37:47.091
As you wish.
- My dear friend.

37:48.990 --> 37:51.820
'Death of a lover'.

38:01.468 --> 38:06.307
Listen to this my friend.
This is the great work

38:06.497 --> 38:09.311
Of my gracious host,
the soon to be,

38:09.411 --> 38:12.306
congratulate me
friend, my pension...

38:12.366 --> 38:14.625
'His heart was broken'

38:14.775 --> 38:16.815
'cleft in two'

38:17.085 --> 38:19.874
'abandoned, lost'

38:20.014 --> 38:22.014
'what could he do?'

38:22.044 --> 38:25.663
'And into this he retched cried'

38:25.783 --> 38:27.783
'She said she loved me'

38:28.003 --> 38:29.652
'But she lied'

38:29.752 --> 38:32.772
'And so betrayed'

38:33.032 --> 38:35.881
'He fell and died'.

38:49.089 --> 38:51.378
Try as he might.

38:51.528 --> 38:55.307
This gracious noble lord.

38:55.737 --> 38:58.027
Who lifts his pen.

38:58.167 --> 39:00.386
And thinks he then can write.

39:00.486 --> 39:04.846
Cannot, for who can pen.

39:05.136 --> 39:07.555
When he is bored.

39:07.635 --> 39:13.594
The mind of leisure
only can be trite.

39:14.204 --> 39:18.463
This pretty knight who
feebly lifts his sword

39:18.533 --> 39:22.252
To make a witless thrust
against his doom.

39:22.382 --> 39:25.602
Is foiled by what his
noble birth affords

39:25.851 --> 39:29.891
Dogs, dogs more dogs
and far too many rooms.

39:30.331 --> 39:34.650
So fortune smiles on
those that own the land

39:34.890 --> 39:39.309
And frowns at the trivia
from the dabblers hand.

39:47.437 --> 39:51.376
I would like you to drop this in
the midst of the filthiest manure.

39:51.476 --> 39:53.616
And Mr Greene's pension, sir?

39:54.446 --> 39:56.645
Pay it, quarterly.

40:08.683 --> 40:09.863
Abroad?

40:09.963 --> 40:12.002
As your ambassador, your majesty.

40:12.102 --> 40:13.782
Ambassador?

40:13.882 --> 40:16.055
I see, once the balance of power...

40:16.155 --> 40:18.391
...has been established
here in Europe.

40:18.491 --> 40:22.500
We must certainly turn
our attention to the east.

40:22.780 --> 40:24.780
Well Orlando.

40:25.900 --> 40:29.399
I fear you will be quite
starved of conversation...

40:29.449 --> 40:33.228
...and amusement in such a
remote corner of the world.

40:33.318 --> 40:38.387
However, I believe they
have an interest in...

40:38.727 --> 40:40.727
...horticulture.

40:40.727 --> 40:46.706
I'd like you to bring
them some tulips.

40:51.565 --> 40:55.844
POLITICS

42:25.916 --> 42:30.895
My dear sir, please
accept my hospitality.

42:30.965 --> 42:35.155
Feel that my home is your home.

42:35.504 --> 42:39.484
And call upon me as you would a
brother, for any of your needs.

42:39.584 --> 42:41.953
You really are to kind.

42:44.123 --> 42:46.007
And I must say I'm
most impressed by...

42:46.107 --> 42:47.892
...your command of
the English language.

42:47.992 --> 42:50.751
I hadn't expect... I mean...

42:50.961 --> 42:52.961
I wasn't led to believe...

42:54.251 --> 42:56.680
Why...are you here?

42:56.950 --> 43:00.250
I'm here as a representative
of his majesty's government.

43:00.350 --> 43:02.349
Yes?

43:03.559 --> 43:05.729
It has been said to me that the

43:05.829 --> 43:08.428
English make a habit
of collecting...

43:09.188 --> 43:11.188
...countries.

43:13.457 --> 43:17.686
Oh. We have no designs upon
your sovereignty at all.

43:17.686 --> 43:18.876
No one at all.

43:18.976 --> 43:21.366
You would assist us...

43:21.436 --> 43:24.615
...in defence against
mutual enemies?

43:41.952 --> 43:46.161
So Orlando, I salute your country.

43:46.231 --> 43:50.550
To England, green
and pleasant land.

44:22.694 --> 44:25.253
And...

44:27.473 --> 44:31.352
And I salute your country...

44:33.571 --> 44:35.571
So...

44:35.641 --> 44:37.641
...spacious...

44:38.111 --> 44:40.110
And...

44:40.340 --> 44:42.840
So... warm.

44:46.079 --> 44:48.079
Ah, yes.

44:48.179 --> 44:53.618
To the glorious sun which shines so
brightly on this bountiful earth.

44:55.957 --> 44:57.957
Quite so.

44:58.916 --> 45:00.916
Erm.

45:07.215 --> 45:09.214
Yes.

45:09.874 --> 45:11.874
Yes.

45:14.014 --> 45:16.013
To beauty of nature.

45:16.283 --> 45:18.663
And of course to
the beauty of women.

45:18.763 --> 45:20.932
And the joys of love.

45:31.250 --> 45:33.250
I see.

45:33.270 --> 45:37.609
You're here as a casualty
of love, my friend.

45:41.428 --> 45:44.508
They're not like us fellows.

45:48.097 --> 45:50.316
Women...

45:51.696 --> 45:53.966
...it is said...

45:54.306 --> 45:56.305
...man should...

45:56.595 --> 46:00.275
...reverence his guarding
lord who created them.

46:00.414 --> 46:05.953
And from a single being
created of like nature his mate.

46:06.973 --> 46:08.973
then from those two...

46:09.083 --> 46:11.252
...scattered like seeds...

46:11.332 --> 46:13.332
...countless men...

46:13.342 --> 46:15.342
...and women.

46:18.991 --> 46:21.210
So Orlando...

46:26.629 --> 46:32.018
Let us now drink to brotherly love.

46:40.937 --> 46:43.916
To the manly virtues.

46:44.866 --> 46:46.865
Loyalty.

46:48.545 --> 46:50.545
Courage.

48:11.719 --> 48:14.518
Take me to your master
my dear fellow.

48:16.758 --> 48:20.437
I said, take me to your master.

48:21.547 --> 48:23.147
Do you speak English?

48:23.247 --> 48:25.466
Do you speak English?

48:26.636 --> 48:30.115
Now look I can assure you
he'll would want to see me.

48:30.215 --> 48:33.385
Just let me pass those, good now.

48:39.503 --> 48:41.763
Lord Orlando?

48:49.621 --> 48:51.621
I.. erh...

48:53.041 --> 48:57.750
May I present myself, I
am the archduke Harry.

48:59.060 --> 49:01.399
Emissary from her majesty.

49:02.449 --> 49:06.508
I have come to inform you that your
ten years here as ambassador...

49:06.608 --> 49:09.758
...have been well
appreciated by her majesty.

49:10.627 --> 49:13.567
would like to celebrate
the new century...

49:13.657 --> 49:15.236
...by raising you...

49:15.336 --> 49:17.226
...to the highest rank...

49:17.326 --> 49:18.316
...in the...

49:18.416 --> 49:19.786
...peerage.

49:19.886 --> 49:21.885
Ahh.

49:22.575 --> 49:24.205
There must be a party.

49:24.305 --> 49:27.124
well of course one must demonstrate
the gravity of an investiture,

49:27.224 --> 49:31.413
A large party, food
and entertainment.

49:31.563 --> 49:34.773
But of course you know
that they call customs

49:34.933 --> 49:42.551
Exactly who you should invite,
to the ball. Who's who.

50:28.882 --> 50:31.632
Strange.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.191
Most strange.

50:34.791 --> 50:39.270
Perhaps they don't hold
punctuality in high regard?

51:10.674 --> 51:14.423
As a representative of
her majesty Queen Anne.

51:14.513 --> 51:16.323
I am pleased...

51:16.423 --> 51:18.422
...and honoured...

51:18.422 --> 51:22.422
...to bestow the most
noble Order of the Bath...

51:22.562 --> 51:25.051
...upon this...

51:25.161 --> 51:27.661
...loyal servant...

51:34.339 --> 51:38.109
...for ambassadorial
services rendered...

51:38.109 --> 51:39.858
...to the Crown...

51:39.958 --> 51:41.338
...and...

51:41.438 --> 51:44.387
...for the glory of god.

52:05.893 --> 52:09.650
I'm sorry to arrive in this
fashion but we must talk.

52:09.750 --> 52:11.750
But this is outrageous.

52:13.212 --> 52:15.645
I was expecting you as a
guest at my party, I...

52:15.745 --> 52:18.231
...didn't realize you were
entertaining hostilities.

52:18.331 --> 52:22.180
I was warned that Englishman
would be dangerous for me.

52:22.390 --> 52:25.179
I would like to give you an
opportunity to prove this wrong.

52:25.279 --> 52:28.969
Then let me introduce you, this is
the archduke Harry from England.

52:29.069 --> 52:31.068
Delighted.

52:31.758 --> 52:33.498
Orlando.

52:33.598 --> 52:35.907
Our enemies are at the city wall.

52:38.037 --> 52:40.036
Will you help?

52:41.776 --> 52:44.636
You wish me to take arms?

52:44.756 --> 52:47.975
Truly Orlando you an
Englishman are not afraid?

52:48.015 --> 52:50.015
Sir.

52:50.964 --> 52:52.964
My Lord.

52:54.264 --> 52:57.393
Despite these appalling manners...

52:57.493 --> 53:01.062
...we must keep our interests
alive in this region.

53:01.722 --> 53:03.872
What do you recommend.

53:08.571 --> 53:10.990
Harry, distribute your arms.
- But these fellows?

53:11.090 --> 53:13.500
Do as I say.
- But sir.

53:35.536 --> 53:37.535
Follow me.

53:42.834 --> 53:44.834
Brother.

54:16.828 --> 54:18.827
Leave him.

54:19.627 --> 54:20.957
Leave him.

54:21.057 --> 54:23.426
This is a dying man.

54:23.816 --> 54:26.346
He's not a man, he's the enemy.

57:23.641 --> 57:26.571
Same person.

57:26.661 --> 57:29.350
No difference at all.

57:33.159 --> 57:36.589
Just a different sex.

58:52.124 --> 58:55.703
Well, here I am again.

01:00:28.845 --> 01:00:32.144
Some more invitations my lady.

01:00:36.803 --> 01:00:40.023
Is not this the lady famed
for her literary gatherings?

01:00:40.123 --> 01:00:45.022
Yes ma'am, but you could not
possibly venture there. Alone.

01:00:45.152 --> 01:00:46.162
Why ever not?

01:00:46.262 --> 01:00:52.340
Society ma'am is full of dangerous
individuals, which and... poets.

01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:05.098
♪ Where you walk, call gale
shall find the glade. ♪

01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:08.547
And how is your leg now Mr Swift?

01:01:08.547 --> 01:01:11.435
I have to tell you that
the gout have left...

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:14.096
...my left leg and is
travelled to my right.

01:01:14.196 --> 01:01:16.676
Aah, the conversation is of legs.

01:01:16.676 --> 01:01:17.975
Gout Mr Pope.

01:01:18.075 --> 01:01:20.125
You are an expert in this field?

01:01:20.225 --> 01:01:23.164
I believe I can say I
have some knowledge.

01:01:23.354 --> 01:01:25.634
A little learning is
a dangerous thing.

01:01:25.734 --> 01:01:30.743
Mr Pope, I must write
that down at once.

01:01:30.933 --> 01:01:33.282
I already have madam.

01:01:33.282 --> 01:01:37.912
If taken as a science the study of
ailments can be quite fascinating.

01:01:38.012 --> 01:01:42.041
Indeed I believe science to
be interesting than poetry.

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:48.140
Do you?

01:01:49.259 --> 01:01:51.869
Appraise sir, Elaborate.

01:01:55.368 --> 01:02:00.327
We.. well the systematic
study, exploration...

01:02:00.377 --> 01:02:04.206
...and taming of the
material world...

01:02:04.266 --> 01:02:08.746
...is surely a proper
occupation for a man.

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.355
Compared to which...

01:02:11.455 --> 01:02:15.634
...the introvert
art of scribbling...

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:31.451
...wishfully...

01:02:31.451 --> 01:02:35.170
...the occupation of...of...

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:37.170
...a fool?

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:42.419
So I admit a general rule
that every poet is a fool.

01:02:42.529 --> 01:02:45.468
But you yourself may
server to show it.

01:02:45.588 --> 01:02:48.518
That every fool is not a poet.

01:02:48.518 --> 01:02:53.597
Mr Pope, you're
pleased to be witty.

01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:20.262
They are all words and
no breeding archduke.

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:23.351
But so amusing.
- Countess, forgive me.

01:03:23.351 --> 01:03:24.751
But the young lady
who has joined us...

01:03:24.851 --> 01:03:27.498
...bears the extraordinary
resemblance to...

01:03:27.598 --> 01:03:28.590
The Lady Orlando.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:30.710
Orlando.

01:03:33.219 --> 01:03:35.839
I were so proud of you Harry.

01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:37.838
The Order of the Bath.

01:03:37.838 --> 01:03:41.737
Marvellous. Cream?

01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:15.978
Well how pleasant it
is I'd live to sip...

01:04:16.078 --> 01:04:18.150
...tea in the presence
of a gracious lady.

01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.740
Do you Pestradus.

01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:23.804
As our good friend Dr
Johnson says Every...

01:04:23.904 --> 01:04:27.139
...man is or desires
to be an... idler.

01:04:28.288 --> 01:04:31.348
Perhaps not every woman Mr Swift.

01:04:32.188 --> 01:04:36.057
Women have no desires,
only affectation.

01:04:36.057 --> 01:04:38.936
Indeed women are but
children of larger growth.

01:04:39.036 --> 01:04:42.386
Aah, but I consider woman to be
a beautiful romantic animal.

01:04:42.486 --> 01:04:44.225
Who should be adorned in...

01:04:44.325 --> 01:04:47.425
Furs and feathers,
pearls and diamonds.

01:04:47.425 --> 01:04:49.024
Apart from my wife of course.

01:04:49.124 --> 01:04:51.734
Will insist upon
attempting to learn Greek.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:54.235
It's so very unbecoming I
can hardly tolerate her...

01:04:54.335 --> 01:04:56.643
...company at the breakfast
table. Why do they do it?

01:04:56.743 --> 01:05:00.802
Oh, every woman is adverse to
contradiction and frankly...

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.821
...most women have no
characters at all.

01:05:03.911 --> 01:05:06.891
Present company accepted of course.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.770
Oh, the lady is aflame.

01:05:13.739 --> 01:05:15.739
And silent.

01:05:18.119 --> 01:05:20.118
Perfect.

01:05:24.157 --> 01:05:25.897
Gentlemen.

01:05:25.997 --> 01:05:28.047
I find it strange.

01:05:28.487 --> 01:05:32.766
You are poets, each one of you and
speak of your muse in the feminine.

01:05:32.866 --> 01:05:35.485
And yet you appear to feel
neither tenderness...

01:05:35.585 --> 01:05:39.724
...nor respect towards your wives
nor towards females in general.

01:05:39.824 --> 01:05:43.267
Madam. I have only
the highest regard...

01:05:43.367 --> 01:05:46.023
...and purest respect for females.

01:05:46.393 --> 01:05:49.642
I find no evidence of that
sentiment in your conversation.

01:05:49.742 --> 01:05:53.942
Conversation is a place where
plays with ideas my dear lady.

01:05:54.032 --> 01:05:56.321
The one forges them quite alone.

01:05:56.371 --> 01:05:58.561
Quite so.
- Quite. Quite.

01:05:58.851 --> 01:06:01.370
The intellect is a solitary place.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:05.314
And therefore quite unsuitable a
terrain for females who must...

01:06:05.414 --> 01:06:07.352
...discover their
natures through...

01:06:07.452 --> 01:06:09.389
...the guidance of
a father or husband.

01:06:09.489 --> 01:06:11.768
And if she has neither?

01:06:12.178 --> 01:06:13.758
Then...

01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:16.707
However charming she
may be dear lady...

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.406
She is lost.

01:06:27.715 --> 01:06:30.754
None of us knew what had happened.

01:06:31.144 --> 01:06:32.714
It is extraordinary.

01:06:32.814 --> 01:06:36.863
And to think we could have
been so charmingly misled.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:59.119
Dear Lady. Orlando.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:05.958
The same.

01:07:06.117 --> 01:07:08.797
We wish to inform you.

01:07:09.887 --> 01:07:11.886
Madam.

01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:15.225
That you are a party to several
major lawsuits that have...

01:07:15.325 --> 01:07:17.935
...been preferred against
you concerning the property.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:20.255
The family seat.

01:07:21.385 --> 01:07:22.884
Pray continue.

01:07:22.984 --> 01:07:24.984
Erh heh.

01:07:26.214 --> 01:07:29.265
One: You are legally
dead and therefore...

01:07:29.365 --> 01:07:32.024
...cannot hold any
property whatsoever.

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:34.052
Ah.

01:07:34.192 --> 01:07:35.202
Fine.

01:07:35.302 --> 01:07:37.721
Two: You are now female.

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:41.271
Which amounts much the same thing.

01:07:41.341 --> 01:07:44.410
Pending the legal
judgment however..

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.499
You have the laws permission
to reside in the property...

01:07:49.339 --> 01:07:54.288
...in a state of incognito.
- Or incognita as the case may be.

01:07:55.898 --> 01:07:56.898
Harry.

01:07:56.998 --> 01:08:00.157
There is only one solution
in your current predicament.

01:08:00.257 --> 01:08:01.627
Indeed.

01:08:01.727 --> 01:08:05.746
I can offer you a house
to rival your own.

01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:08.595
I don't quite understand.

01:08:08.695 --> 01:08:10.255
I confess.

01:08:10.355 --> 01:08:15.284
Orlando, to me you were and always
will be, weather male or female...

01:08:15.354 --> 01:08:19.912
The pink the pearl and the
perfection of yourself?

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:27.171
I'm offering you my hand.

01:08:28.531 --> 01:08:31.651
Oh. Archduke.

01:08:31.711 --> 01:08:34.979
That is very kind of you, yes.

01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:37.029
I can't accept.

01:08:37.670 --> 01:08:39.669
But I...

01:08:39.828 --> 01:08:42.399
I, am England.

01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:45.497
And you are mine.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:47.388
I see.

01:08:47.488 --> 01:08:49.487
On what grounds?

01:08:50.277 --> 01:08:52.346
That I adore you.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:56.086
And this means that
I belong to you?

01:08:56.636 --> 01:08:59.854
Are you refusing me?
- I am, I'm sorry.

01:09:00.274 --> 01:09:02.564
But Orlando.

01:09:02.765 --> 01:09:06.283
With your history quite
frankly who else will have you?

01:09:06.384 --> 01:09:08.774
Do you realize what
you're turning down?

01:09:08.874 --> 01:09:14.482
With your ambiguous sexuality
which I am prepared to tolerate.

01:09:15.272 --> 01:09:18.721
This is your last chance
of respectability.

01:09:18.721 --> 01:09:20.180
Can't breathe.

01:09:20.281 --> 01:09:24.560
You will die a spinster,
dispossessed and alone.

01:09:35.858 --> 01:09:37.938
Spinster.

01:09:41.437 --> 01:09:43.437
Alone.

01:10:43.865 --> 01:10:50.794
Nature, nature, I'm
your bride. Take me.

01:11:29.606 --> 01:11:31.396
You're hurt ma'am?

01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:33.495
I'm dead, sir.

01:11:33.795 --> 01:11:36.665
Dead. That's serious. Can I help?

01:11:37.704 --> 01:11:39.704
Will you marry me?

01:11:41.654 --> 01:11:46.593
Ma'am... I would gladly... um, I...
but I fear my ankle is twisted.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.339
What's that?

01:12:03.439 --> 01:12:05.439
The future.

01:12:30.114 --> 01:12:34.223
Some milk? My god I don't
yet know your name, sir.

01:12:34.303 --> 01:12:38.363
How strange, I feel as though
I know everything about you.

01:12:38.373 --> 01:12:41.762
When like meets like.
My name is Shelmerdine.

01:12:41.812 --> 01:12:43.292
Orlando.

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:47.591
So.. it only remains to fill in
such unimportant details as..

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.740
What we do and so on.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:52.720
Well you can see for
yourself what I was.

01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:54.819
Was?

01:13:22.974 --> 01:13:26.173
You see, I'm about
to lose everything.

01:13:28.733 --> 01:13:31.462
Then you can come with me.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:35.491
Where are you going?

01:13:36.001 --> 01:13:38.021
Back to America?

01:13:38.321 --> 01:13:41.120
When the wind changes
to the south-west.

01:13:45.110 --> 01:13:47.399
America.

01:13:47.869 --> 01:13:49.669
I've been abroad.

01:13:49.769 --> 01:13:51.658
But east.

01:13:51.758 --> 01:13:55.468
Then you know as well as I,
how good it is to travel.

01:13:57.407 --> 01:13:59.077
Like a free spirit.

01:13:59.177 --> 01:14:02.076
Unfettered by position
or possession.

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:08.885
Unfettered.

01:14:10.605 --> 01:14:12.224
Are you...

01:14:12.324 --> 01:14:15.624
An adventurer by profession?

01:14:18.713 --> 01:14:22.522
My profession, if you
can call it that...

01:14:22.652 --> 01:14:24.822
...it's the pursuit of liberty.

01:14:27.051 --> 01:14:31.561
The bright shade, of
some immortal dream.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.850
Which walks when tempus sleeps.

01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.599
The wave of life's dark stream.

01:14:40.759 --> 01:14:43.508
You don't really want a husband.

01:14:44.268 --> 01:14:47.847
I suppose your journey is
to be hazardous at times.

01:14:48.147 --> 01:14:50.917
Think, you want a lover.

01:14:51.557 --> 01:14:53.586
You've fought in battles?

01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:55.996
Like a man?

01:14:56.216 --> 01:14:58.265
I have fought.

01:14:58.685 --> 01:15:00.455
Blood?

01:15:00.555 --> 01:15:02.694
If necessary, yes.

01:15:02.974 --> 01:15:06.704
Freedom must be taken,
if it must be won.

01:15:09.353 --> 01:15:11.663
If I were a man...

01:15:11.953 --> 01:15:13.952
You?

01:15:15.572 --> 01:15:20.631
I might choose not to risk my
life for an uncertain cause.

01:15:21.321 --> 01:15:26.150
I might think that freedom won
by death is not worth having.

01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:29.269
In fact...

01:15:29.369 --> 01:15:33.858
You might choose not to
be a real man at all.

01:15:36.938 --> 01:15:39.017
Say, if I were a woman...

01:15:40.507 --> 01:15:42.507
You?

01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:48.186
I might choose not to sacrifice
my life caring for my children,

01:15:48.406 --> 01:15:51.235
nor my children's children,

01:15:51.435 --> 01:15:55.824
nor to drown anonymously in
the milk of female kindness,

01:15:56.364 --> 01:16:01.063
but instead, say, to go abroad.

01:16:02.593 --> 01:16:04.812
Would I then be...

01:16:07.132 --> 01:16:10.631
A real woman?

01:16:30.137 --> 01:16:37.076
I think I'm going to faint. I've
never felt better in my life.

01:19:18.914 --> 01:19:23.054
Rise, from pains of thee.

01:19:24.213 --> 01:19:28.243
From first sweet sleep of night.

01:19:29.013 --> 01:19:32.632
Winds are breathing low.

01:19:32.982 --> 01:19:36.951
Heavens stars are shining bright.

01:19:47.269 --> 01:19:50.688
But it is day.

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:55.517
Days are nice.

01:19:56.157 --> 01:20:00.166
Mingling are sweet embrace on end.

01:20:08.565 --> 01:20:09.645
Who's there?

01:20:09.745 --> 01:20:12.581
Excuse me my lady, there
are two officers...

01:20:12.681 --> 01:20:15.124
...outside with a
warrant from the queen.

01:20:15.223 --> 01:20:16.773
The queen?

01:20:16.873 --> 01:20:21.642
Victoria, ma'am. The gentlemen say
they must speak to you in person.

01:20:23.912 --> 01:20:25.911
Oh.

01:20:26.231 --> 01:20:29.041
I'd almost forgotten.

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.969
Her ladyship.

01:20:38.739 --> 01:20:41.048
The lawsuit is settled.

01:20:41.208 --> 01:20:44.394
My sex is pronounced
indisputably and...

01:20:44.494 --> 01:20:47.437
...beyond shadow of
a doubt... female...

01:20:47.627 --> 01:20:51.336
Therefore heirs made of my
body will risk it taking...

01:20:51.381 --> 01:20:54.881
...as red. I lose everything
unless I have a son.

01:21:02.064 --> 01:21:04.064
So you're free.

01:21:04.224 --> 01:21:09.053
I think the spirit of this century
is finally taken me and broken me.

01:21:09.183 --> 01:21:11.712
I would be sad if it were true.

01:21:12.192 --> 01:21:13.902
But it is not.

01:21:14.002 --> 01:21:15.882
Come with me.

01:21:15.982 --> 01:21:18.101
I cannot.

01:21:18.411 --> 01:21:20.281
I can't just follow you.

01:21:20.381 --> 01:21:23.249
You can stay and stagnate
in the past or leave...

01:21:23.349 --> 01:21:25.980
...and live for the future,
the choice is yours.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.564
As a man one has
choices, Shelmerdine.

01:21:28.664 --> 01:21:31.149
Orlando, you can do
whatever you want.

01:21:31.249 --> 01:21:33.538
Would you like to
have a child with me?

01:21:33.638 --> 01:21:35.758
So that you can keep your house?

01:21:35.858 --> 01:21:40.207
No, not for the house
Shelmerdine. Perhaps for love?

01:21:40.487 --> 01:21:43.496
These are the times
that try men's souls.

01:21:43.586 --> 01:21:46.646
My love is for mankind,
I must fight for liberty.

01:21:46.746 --> 01:21:50.115
I must fight for a future.
- For a future?

01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:55.514
This future of yours Shelmerdine,
when it's gonna begin... today?

01:21:55.564 --> 01:21:58.023
or is it always tomorrow?

01:21:58.313 --> 01:22:01.463
Touché Orlando.

01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:11.621
The wind.

01:22:12.011 --> 01:22:14.370
The wind.

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:17.550
The south-west wind.

01:22:44.454 --> 01:22:48.784
Good bye, Shelmerdine. Good luck.

01:22:49.033 --> 01:22:51.103
Orlando.

01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:52.689
It's really very good.

01:24:53.559 --> 01:24:57.448
Written from the heart.

01:24:58.608 --> 01:25:01.088
I think it'll sell.

01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:04.787
Provided you rewrite it. You know.

01:25:04.877 --> 01:25:09.026
Increase the love interest.
Give it a happy ending.

01:25:09.556 --> 01:25:13.845
By the way, how long
did this draft take you?

01:26:52.296 --> 01:26:54.136
Come on. Come on.

01:26:54.236 --> 01:26:56.115
She.

01:26:56.215 --> 01:26:59.625
For there can be no
doubt about her sex.

01:26:59.775 --> 01:27:03.088
Is visiting the house
she finally lost for...

01:27:03.188 --> 01:27:06.127
...the first time in
over a hundred years.

01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:10.512
She does still have certain
natural advantages of course.

01:27:10.672 --> 01:27:14.328
She is tall and slim, with
a slightly androgynous...

01:27:14.428 --> 01:27:18.137
...appearance that many
females at the time aspire to.

01:27:18.151 --> 01:27:20.770
Then her upbringing,

01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:26.029
she's lived for four hundred
years and hardly aged a day.

01:27:26.509 --> 01:27:28.519
And because this is England.

01:27:28.569 --> 01:27:32.018
Everyone pretends not to notice.

01:27:32.608 --> 01:27:35.418
But she has changed.

01:27:35.718 --> 01:27:39.377
She is no longer
trapped by destiny.

01:27:39.747 --> 01:27:44.256
And... ever since she
let go of the past...

01:27:44.746 --> 01:27:48.175
She found her life was beginning.
