00:06.000 --> 00:08.800
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.720 --> 00:17.720
MORNING OF DECEMBER 11TH

00:27.040 --> 00:29.080
MAURICE LEBLANC'S BIRTHDAY

00:40.640 --> 00:42.880
Sir, your ticket. Thank you.

00:44.960 --> 00:45.960
Sir, your ticket.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.240
Ladies and gentlemen, tickets.

00:57.920 --> 00:58.760
Raoul!

01:01.000 --> 01:01.840
Raoul!

01:07.960 --> 01:08.800
Stop!

01:19.920 --> 01:20.800
Let go of me!

01:22.160 --> 01:23.000
Stop!

01:35.240 --> 01:36.320
Raoul!

01:36.400 --> 01:37.400
Raoul!

01:39.560 --> 01:40.400
Raoul!

01:41.040 --> 01:41.880
Lupin?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.000
Looking for a child dressed up as Lupin?

01:50.680 --> 01:52.560
Yes! A little boy!

01:52.640 --> 01:54.520
He's 14. He's our son.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.160
He's wearing a top hat.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.120
Mixed-race.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.520
-Mixed-race?
-Yes.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.160
I saw a mixed-race boy
tussling with a guy.

02:02.280 --> 02:03.360
Wait!

02:04.440 --> 02:05.280
Raoul!

02:06.520 --> 02:07.360
Raoul!

02:08.640 --> 02:11.080
They went that way. In a gray BMW.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.880
-What was he like?
-Black. Beige raincoat.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.480
Badly shaved, skinny.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.520
Shit, Assane.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.080
This is your fault!

02:20.120 --> 02:22.920
It's the guy from the train!
Who the fuck is he?

02:24.680 --> 02:25.760
You lied to me!

02:31.880 --> 02:33.360
Stop! What are you doing?

02:34.840 --> 02:35.800
What are you doing?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.400
Let go of that car! I'm calling the cops.

02:40.480 --> 02:42.120
No, not the cops. Stop it.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.200
Calm down. Let me handle it. OK?

02:44.280 --> 02:46.720
-I'll call them.
-Trust me! Not the cops.

02:47.280 --> 02:51.280
-I'll bring him back. Trust me.
-I stopped trusting you a while ago.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.120
Claire, not the police.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.960
What are you doing here?

03:00.760 --> 03:01.960
I want to help.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.520
MUSIC CONSERVATORY

03:48.040 --> 03:49.880
Claire? How was your rehearsal?

03:52.080 --> 03:53.920
Don't want me to walk with you?

03:55.240 --> 03:56.240
What did I do?

03:57.920 --> 03:58.880
What's going on?

03:59.880 --> 04:00.720
Claire?

04:02.000 --> 04:04.080
Not everything revolves around you.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.240
I left the room.
It was like this when I came back.

04:54.320 --> 04:56.040
I bet no one fessed up to it.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.080
-People will do anything.
-Can you fix it?

04:59.160 --> 05:01.920
Fixing it would cost more
than buying a new one.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.840
Hang on.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.360
What about my audition?

05:10.640 --> 05:12.520
Hang on…

05:13.800 --> 05:14.680
Here.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.280
Try this one.

05:59.160 --> 06:00.160
It sounds great.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.560
-How much?
-3,000 francs.

06:05.680 --> 06:06.720
I don't have enough.

06:08.000 --> 06:08.840
I'm sorry.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.160
Can we rent it?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.320
-And you are?
-Assane.

06:17.400 --> 06:18.920
He's a friend.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.280
You can rent it for 350 francs a day.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.320
Yeah. But not you.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.720
-Why?
-Yes, why?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.160
Because. It's my shop. I decide.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.040
Good luck for your exam.

06:30.680 --> 06:31.640
Come on, Assane.

06:33.680 --> 06:34.520
Let's go.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.320
Racist.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.840
-Do you know the area?
-No.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.960
Get your phone, see where we are,

06:56.040 --> 06:57.360
and where they could be.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.560
Wait a minute.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.360
Fuck, no reception!

07:03.440 --> 07:05.000
Must be a map in this car.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.560
They passed through Bourneville!

07:15.120 --> 07:17.800
-Is it far?
-I'd say four, five kilometers.

07:17.880 --> 07:20.200
Maybe they stopped there,
or someone saw them.

07:22.040 --> 07:24.520
We have to stop there.
I need to make a call.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.800
-Are you kidding me?
-No.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.080
My wife's in Étretat.
How am I supposed to tell her?

07:30.160 --> 07:31.280
You know women.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.200
She'll be thinking
I'm the one who was kidnapped.

08:05.120 --> 08:06.840
Come on!

08:08.800 --> 08:09.840
CALL FAILED

08:09.920 --> 08:10.760
Shit!

08:12.480 --> 08:13.680
Look somewhere else.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.520
Or I'll make you.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.840
Come with me!

08:39.320 --> 08:41.320
I said get in there. Get in there!

08:56.560 --> 09:00.920
-What do you suggest?
-A missing person report at the station.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.760
After 24 hours,

09:02.840 --> 09:05.320
we send a broadcast to all services.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.160
A broadcast to all services?

09:08.600 --> 09:11.160
Do you realize that this is a kidnapping?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.320
OK, you're useless.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.960
-Where are you going?
-To find my son.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.440
You scream, I'll kill you.

09:59.360 --> 10:00.480
Good, you learn fast.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.240
Gentlemen.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.320
Do you have a phone?

10:41.520 --> 10:42.480
And some change?

10:43.120 --> 10:45.040
Well, you have to buy something.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.240
-Who is this?
-It's Léonard.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.480
I'm in Bourneville, a village in Normandy.

11:25.560 --> 11:28.880
-Why there?
-I followed our client, as planned,

11:28.960 --> 11:30.600
but I wanted to tell you that…

11:32.480 --> 11:34.040
there was a small setback.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.640
-I'm with his son.
-His son?

11:38.280 --> 11:40.360
-Yes.
-Listen. It's the father I want.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.720
Clean up your mess, and do it neatly.

11:42.800 --> 11:43.640
Shit.

11:53.640 --> 11:54.480
Gentlemen.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.200
Don't be stupid.

12:24.480 --> 12:25.320
Sir?

12:27.040 --> 12:31.080
Have you seen a gray car?
A Black man at the wheel? A teenager?

12:32.200 --> 12:33.720
A gray car? Sir?

12:34.280 --> 12:35.480
Answer me, at least.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.040
Even "no" is an answer.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.680
-Hello?
-Hello, it's me.

12:47.760 --> 12:48.800
-Still sick?
-No.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.120
-I'm in Normandy.
-What?

12:51.200 --> 12:54.040
You need to get back here.
Shit's getting real.

12:54.120 --> 12:56.520
-Why?
-We caught the wrong Sernine.

12:56.600 --> 12:58.680
-Of course. I'm with him now.
-What?

12:59.840 --> 13:02.080
-He's right in front of me.
-Sernine?

13:02.160 --> 13:03.440
Yes, Sernine!

13:04.440 --> 13:07.040
-I'm in Bourneville.
-Why are you with him?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.240
He's coming over.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.600
Is everything OK?

13:09.680 --> 13:11.480
-You can't talk?
-Yes, right.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.400
-Do you need backup?
-Yes.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.520
We need to catch him.

13:22.920 --> 13:23.840
I love you too.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.800
Excuse me.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.520
I'm looking for a Black man in a gray car.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.360
With a 14-year-old teenager.
Mixed-race, curly hair.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
He's my son. He's been kidnapped.

13:44.160 --> 13:45.480
So, if you know anything,

13:47.000 --> 13:47.840
tell me.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.440
Buy something.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.480
-I'm not kidding around.
-It's him!

14:01.000 --> 14:03.680
-I'll continue on my own.
-I have to join you!

14:04.200 --> 14:06.560
I can help you catch this guy.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.000
Get in.

14:17.360 --> 14:19.920
Her exam's on Friday.
A church in the 11th district.

14:20.400 --> 14:22.760
-Why did they break her violin?
-She's too good.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.640
For real. I heard her play.
She's incredible.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.400
So, if you find her a violin,
you'll be her hero.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.320
For now,
I'm more like her problem than her hero.

14:32.920 --> 14:36.760
The asshole from the shop won't rent it
since she's friends with a Black boy.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.680
Seriously?

14:41.880 --> 14:44.920
-What would Lupin have done?
-You know him best.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.960
I think he would go back to the store,

14:50.840 --> 14:52.000
steal a violin,

14:53.000 --> 14:54.400
and give it to Claire.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.720
There!

15:40.840 --> 15:42.040
I'M ON MY WAY!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.440
-It's my wife.
-Yeah?

16:25.800 --> 16:27.400
No!

16:54.440 --> 16:55.440
We've lost him.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.240
I'm opening up. Don't be stupid.

19:29.720 --> 19:30.720
It's your son?

19:34.920 --> 19:37.280
DAD, I TOOK THE GUY'S PHONE.

19:37.360 --> 19:39.080
I GOT AWAY.

19:41.720 --> 19:43.400
WHERE ARE YOU?

19:48.920 --> 19:50.720
IN SOME OLD HOUSE

20:19.520 --> 20:22.760
LET'S DO LIKE LUPIN DOES WITH HIS DAUGHTER
IN CAGLIOSTRO

20:24.040 --> 20:25.840
It's not Lupin's daughter.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.920
-It's his son.
-You a fan of Lupin?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.960
-Yes, I love it.
-So does my son.

20:31.680 --> 20:34.120
If he wrote this, he'll spot the mistake.

20:35.520 --> 20:36.480
If he doesn't…

20:37.440 --> 20:38.440
It's a trap.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.280
Don't be scared. Your dad's on his way.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.480
I'll take care of him.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.440
And then,

22:13.960 --> 22:15.280
I'll take care of you.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.000
This way.

22:24.240 --> 22:25.080
Hey!

22:25.840 --> 22:26.720
Hey!

22:26.800 --> 22:28.320
What are you doing? Hide!

22:35.040 --> 22:36.520
Hey! He can see you!

22:48.440 --> 22:49.760
Well, it's your father.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.000
-Dad!
-Shut up!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.200
Dad! I'm here!

23:01.480 --> 23:03.160
Touch one hair on his head,

23:03.760 --> 23:04.600
I'll kill you.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.720
-I'm here!
-You want your son?

23:07.480 --> 23:08.480
Come and get him.

23:18.240 --> 23:22.920
CLOSED

23:26.880 --> 23:29.560
-There's a way in through the back.
-Possibly.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.000
We get the violin.
We'll give it back to him.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.880
-Once she's passed her exam?
-Yes.

23:37.200 --> 23:38.040
You coming?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.240
Who will keep lookout?

23:42.880 --> 23:43.720
You're right.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.160
What's that noise?

26:40.000 --> 26:42.200
-Call the police. It's their job.
-No.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.720
Police are either incompetent or corrupt.
Or both.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.840
-Don't say that.
-I'm telling you.

26:49.320 --> 26:52.320
My son's kidnapper
has the police in his pocket.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.240
What?

27:04.800 --> 27:05.640
All right.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.320
What would Lupin do?

27:09.400 --> 27:10.520
This isn't a game.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.680
ESTIMATED TIME TO ARRIVAL:
1 HOUR 25 MINUTES

27:43.120 --> 27:45.120
-Bye.
-Bye.

27:54.040 --> 27:56.120
-Why are you here?
-Waiting for you.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.880
Something for you.

27:58.720 --> 27:59.560
Here.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.720
Open it.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.280
Assane, what did you do?

28:15.360 --> 28:17.200
Relax, I just borrowed it.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.040
Go on, try it out.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.000
-No, I can't.
-Go on.

28:33.080 --> 28:33.960
No!

28:34.040 --> 28:35.560
Play for me!

28:35.640 --> 28:36.880
Come to the audition.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.120
-Please.
-No.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.280
How much time do I have?

28:52.600 --> 28:53.440
For what?

28:54.480 --> 28:55.720
Before they get here.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.200
-Who?
-Your colleagues at the station.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.240
The ones you called.

29:02.000 --> 29:02.840
Your wife.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.360
When do they arrive?

29:09.320 --> 29:11.520
-I don't know.
-You're lying, Guédira.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.240
I know your name. You're a cop.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.840
Been searching for you for weeks.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.640
-Only I figured it out.
-I know.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.200
-I'd have arrested you if…
-If you were armed.

29:32.840 --> 29:34.040
You're Ganimard.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
How much time?

29:38.920 --> 29:40.520
One hour, maybe a bit less.

29:42.880 --> 29:43.720
Thank you.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.040
Hey!

29:49.120 --> 29:49.960
Untie me!

29:51.040 --> 29:51.960
I can help you!

29:52.040 --> 29:53.160
I already told you.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.640
I don't work with cops.

30:09.760 --> 30:12.320
