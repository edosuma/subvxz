00:12.720 --> 00:14.120
I'm Fred Sirieix.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.680
I've worked
in the restaurant industry
for 25 years.

00:16.720 --> 00:21.040
Right now,
the UK's restaurant scene
is the envy of the world.

00:21.080 --> 00:25.640
And all it takes
is one great idea to make
a fortune on the high street.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.800
But has the next generation
of restaurants

00:29.840 --> 00:33.880
got what it takes to become
a multi-million pound business?

00:33.920 --> 00:36.840
Over the next six weeks,
here, in Manchester,

00:36.880 --> 00:38.560
the food capital of the north,

00:38.600 --> 00:41.600
twelve of the most exciting
new restaurant ideas

00:41.640 --> 00:44.520
are in with a chance
of a life-changing investment

00:44.560 --> 00:48.160
from some of the UK's
most respected investors.

00:48.200 --> 00:52.920
These are the men and women
who can turn an idea
into a national brand.

00:52.960 --> 00:57.120
We're looking at putting
a lot of money into
the absolute best concept.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.160
This is the kind of model
that you dream of.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.800
If I find the right operator,
I'll be fighting for it.

01:05.160 --> 01:08.000
[Fred] Each week,
the investors will give
the people behind

01:08.040 --> 01:11.040
two great, new food ideas
a unique opportunity...

01:11.080 --> 01:12.360
Ah, this is brilliant.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.120
[Fred] Their own
pop-up restaurant.

01:15.120 --> 01:16.440
Right, rock-and-roll, man.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.160
[Fred] They'll have
just three days to prove...

01:18.200 --> 01:19.920
Nobody seems to know
the table numbers.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.560
[Fred] ...they've got
what it takes...

01:21.600 --> 01:22.760
It's a disaster.

01:22.800 --> 01:24.560
[Fred] ...to make it
on the high street.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.320
When you start to rush,
that's when you start
to make more mistakes.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.240
-There's a big backlog.
of customers at the door.
-[woman] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:29.280 --> 01:30.800
What are you gonna
do about it?

01:30.840 --> 01:35.080
If I was to invest,
it will take
£500,000 to £750,000.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.200
Time to make some dough.

01:37.240 --> 01:41.640
[Fred] After the three days,
will the investors walk
back into the restaurant...

01:41.680 --> 01:43.080
[sighs]

01:43.120 --> 01:44.720
...and make them an offer?

01:44.760 --> 01:46.520
It's a £600,000 lunch.

01:46.560 --> 01:49.280
We are not gonna leave
without an investment.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.400
I'm sorry. Your time is up.

01:51.440 --> 01:52.960
The doors are open
for business.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.640
Welcome to Million Pound Menu.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
What does is take
to create a smash-hit
restaurant business?

02:06.040 --> 02:07.840
Great food?
Certainly.

02:07.880 --> 02:10.000
Great people?
Most definitely.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.200
But first,
you need a great idea.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.680
Get it right,
and you could change
the way people eat,

02:14.720 --> 02:16.880
and make a lot of money
in the process.

02:16.920 --> 02:21.400
[narrator] The UK spends
over £33 billion a year
on eating out.

02:21.440 --> 02:24.960
And while conditions
may be challenging
on the high street right now,

02:25.000 --> 02:28.480
investors are still on the hunt
for new ideas strong enough

02:28.520 --> 02:31.400
to get the customers queuing.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.520
[man] This is our signature
fettuccine Alfredo.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.520
It's gonna blow your mind.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.800
[narrator] The men and women
behind some of the most
successful businesses

02:38.840 --> 02:40.000
on the high street...

02:40.040 --> 02:42.520
This is our signature dish,
braised beef ragu.

02:42.560 --> 02:47.240
...have met to hear ideas
from the next generation
of restaurant entrepreneurs...

02:47.280 --> 02:50.760
[woman] Wholesome Junkies
is vegan junk food
with a wholesome twist.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.040
I can see a Papa Fritz
in Germany, Berlin.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.760
[narrator] ...who think
their concept
is worth big money.

02:56.800 --> 03:00.440
We require an investment
of £225,000 to help us open

03:00.480 --> 03:03.280
the first of, hopefully,
many great co-outlets.

03:03.320 --> 03:07.560
[narrator] Over 400 people
competed for the chance
to run a trial pop-up

03:07.600 --> 03:10.080
to prove their idea
deserved investment.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.480
Conceptually,
it's very simple to do.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.800
It's very Instagrammable.

03:13.840 --> 03:17.160
I have to say that I thought
the branding sucked.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.640
[narrator]
The panel chose the two ideas

03:18.680 --> 03:22.720
with the strongest food,
brand and business plan.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.080
I can't think of anywhere
where this will not be popular.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.120
[narrator] Then, the investors
each had to decide

03:28.160 --> 03:30.520
whether they wanted
to pursue the opportunity.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.680
The food offered
is really strong.
It screams fun.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.960
And I'd love to see it
in Manchester.

03:37.400 --> 03:42.680
My name is Ewen Hutchison,
and I am the owner and founder
of ShrimpWreck.

03:42.720 --> 03:46.000
[narrator] The first idea
to get the investors excited...

03:46.040 --> 03:51.960
A self-trained chef
who believes his shrimp burgers
could be the new fast food.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.520
I'm putting this together
to ask for an investment
of £100,000

03:55.560 --> 03:57.880
to open up
our first restaurant.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.280
Thank you.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.080
There's possibly
a very good reason
why no-one's done

04:01.120 --> 04:02.720
that mid-market very well,

04:02.760 --> 04:06.120
between your cheap local
fish and chip shop

04:06.160 --> 04:08.880
and your slightly higher end
fish offerings.

04:08.920 --> 04:11.080
He, obviously, can work out
of a very small premises,

04:11.120 --> 04:12.240
which we all agree

04:13.000 --> 04:13.880
cuts down on the risk.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.080
My name's David Page.

04:15.120 --> 04:17.640
I was chief executive
of Pizza Express.

04:17.680 --> 04:20.000
And I am an investor
in restaurants.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.000
I'd like to go
and taste the food.
It looks brilliant.

04:22.040 --> 04:24.520
ShrimpWreck
is extremely simple.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.640
If you've got
a much more
extensive menu,

04:26.680 --> 04:29.480
there are many more areas
to go wrong.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.640
So, if you've got shrimp
in a bun, you can get it
for a very low price.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.640
It tastes brilliant.
It's got massive
roll-out potential.

04:35.680 --> 04:38.480
I'm always keen
to check out
any rising talent.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.520
So, yeah, I'd be in.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.800
[narrator] Next, an idea
for a restaurant serving
exclusively British produce.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.440
Welcome to Epoch.
Our main aim
is to bring together

04:48.480 --> 04:50.880
the best British farmers,
wine producers, and craftsmen

04:50.920 --> 04:54.000
in order to bring you
the most unique
British experience possible.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.400
[narrator] Ruth and Emily need
a sizable £600,000 to open
their fine dining restaurant.

04:59.440 --> 05:02.680
I think these two young women
are absolutely great.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.120
I would love to see more women
succeeding in the industry.

05:06.160 --> 05:09.080
And I would love to go see
what they do in Manchester.

05:09.120 --> 05:10.600
I am Lydia Forte.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.760
I work for my family business,
which is Rocco Forte Hotels.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.080
Luxury hotels
are often considered
a bit old-fashioned

05:17.120 --> 05:19.200
and a bit behind the times,

05:19.240 --> 05:22.520
and I think it's great
to be able to offer something
which is exciting and new,

05:22.560 --> 05:25.360
and bring in
a totally new clientele
to the space.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.680
Going forward, we have to get
the next generation ready,

05:27.720 --> 05:30.240
so I would love to go
and check their food out,

05:30.280 --> 05:32.320
and their wines as well.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.080
My name is Atul Kochhar.
I have eight restaurants
of my own.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.400
When I look
at some of the young people
who are coming up

05:37.440 --> 05:39.040
with fantastic concepts,

05:39.080 --> 05:42.800
and they don't have
any know-how of running
the restaurant,

05:42.840 --> 05:45.120
I think that's where
people like me come in.

05:45.160 --> 05:48.160
We partner with them
because we appreciate
their talent,

05:48.200 --> 05:52.480
we see their energy,
we see their burning desire
to succeed.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.120
And I feel that
if I like the concept,

05:55.160 --> 05:57.480
I would want to invest
£1 million.

05:57.520 --> 05:59.480
[narrator] The first ideas
have been chosen,

05:59.520 --> 06:02.480
one high street,
one high end.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.400
Two investors are interested
in each idea.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.480
Epoch and ShrimpWreck
could both end up
with a major investment

06:09.520 --> 06:11.760
or both walk away
with nothing.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.840
[Fred] Manchester has one of
the most dynamic food scenes
in the UK.

06:28.880 --> 06:32.240
The number of restaurants
have doubled
in the last five years,

06:32.280 --> 06:35.400
and now, two new restaurants
are about to open for business.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.120
They've got just three days
to make a big impression.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.800
Get it right,
and it could change
their lives.

06:40.840 --> 06:45.120
[narrator] The two ideas
will take over identical
existing restaurant sites,

06:45.160 --> 06:47.360
just 100 yards apart.

06:47.400 --> 06:51.720
Today, Ewen and Ruth
and Emily are about to see
their new restaurants

06:51.760 --> 06:53.400
for the very first time.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.960
[Ewen] This is unreal.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.440
It's a proper menu,
not just written in chalk
on a board.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.600
Yeah, this looks really cool.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.400
[narrator]
Over the last month,

07:05.440 --> 07:06.600
they've worked
with the designer

07:06.640 --> 07:08.840
to bring their
restaurant brand to life.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.160
It's exactly
what I had in mind, as well.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.640
Love it.

07:14.680 --> 07:18.320
Last night,
it all sort of hit me.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.960
To be able
to just come into
this environment

07:21.000 --> 07:24.760
and to be able to pitch my idea
to these investors is amazing.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.120
This is happening.
This is it.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.320
Here you go, mate.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.440
Always good to know
where the whisks are.

07:28.480 --> 07:30.360
You have to know
where the whisks are.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.160
[narrator]
Twenty-seven-year-old Ewen

07:32.200 --> 07:34.240
borrowed £3,000
from his parents

07:34.280 --> 07:37.440
to start ShrimpWreck
18 months ago.

07:37.480 --> 07:39.680
[Ewen] I hated my job.
I just went, "Sack this,"

07:39.720 --> 07:45.200
and quit,
and then I bought myself
a griddle and a fryer,

07:45.240 --> 07:47.320
'cause that's all I could
really afford at the time.

07:47.360 --> 07:51.520
[narrator] Now, Ewen wants
£100,000 to start
his first restaurant,

07:51.560 --> 07:54.240
and kick off his dreams
of a high street chain.

07:54.280 --> 07:57.480
You know, I was looking
at the market,
and it's not being done.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.640
I need to do it soon,
before someone else
does it.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.120
And that...
That's now.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.480
[narrator]
Ruth Hansom and Emily Lambert
were working together

08:05.520 --> 08:08.280
at the Ritz,
when they dreamt up Epoch.

08:08.320 --> 08:11.640
Unlike ShrimpWreck,
it's never traded.

08:11.680 --> 08:15.560
But now, for the next
three days, it will be
their names on the door.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.360
-Oh, my God.
-Isn't that cool.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.760
[Emily] This is amazing.
[Ruth] It's real.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.160
Oh, my God. It's gorgeous.

08:24.200 --> 08:27.560
All the planning
and now seeing it,
like, all here,

08:27.600 --> 08:31.520
and doing it
with, like, my best friend
is just amazing.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.720
[narrator] Chef Ruth is 22.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.400
And Emily, a sommelier,
just 20.

08:36.440 --> 08:39.880
But they've already worked
at one of the best hotels
in the world.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.320
How I actually
got into the industry

08:41.360 --> 08:43.080
is entering a competition
through school.

08:43.120 --> 08:46.680
I did that when I was 16.
Came to London
for the national final.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.760
I ended up then, deciding,
"Oh, I want to be a chef."

08:49.800 --> 08:52.200
Absolutely pitched
out of North Yorkshire.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.800
It's like,
"Mom, I'm moving
to London."

08:53.840 --> 08:56.800
Got on a train at 16,
and I've been in London
ever since.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.760
Oh!

08:58.800 --> 09:02.280
I'm Emily. I'd just turned 17,
and I got offered a position
on the Ritz Academy.

09:02.320 --> 09:06.520
And I started in the
restaurant, and then I just
kind of found a love for wine,

09:06.560 --> 09:10.600
and just,
the bespoke personal service
the Ritz offered.

09:10.640 --> 09:12.840
[Ruth] I think
the hardest thing
about this industry

09:12.880 --> 09:14.600
might be the hours.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.760
And there's
a lot of things you miss,
like Christmas.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.400
Like, I've not been home
for Christmas
for the past five years,

09:19.440 --> 09:20.760
but it is worth it.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.000
Oh, I'm so excited!

09:23.040 --> 09:24.120
-Yeah.
-Oh!

09:27.560 --> 09:28.440
Morning.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.720
-[Ruth] Hey!
-How are you?

09:29.760 --> 09:31.000
-Good. Thank you.
-Ruth, how are you? I'm Fred.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.000
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

09:32.040 --> 09:33.120
-Hi.
-Hey, Emily. How are you?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.040
-Nice to meet you.
-Lovely to meet you.

09:34.080 --> 09:34.960
Are you okay?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.440
Can I take my coat off?

09:36.480 --> 09:37.880
[Emily] Yes, of course.
Please, let me take it for you.

09:37.920 --> 09:40.040
-Oh, that's very kind of you.
-In the role already.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.360
-Thank you very much.
-Very good.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.680
-How are you feeling?
-Yeah, good.

09:42.720 --> 09:44.960
Just getting relaxed, I think.
Just about.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.520
Because I remember,
at your age, being 20,

09:47.560 --> 09:49.400
working in a
three Michelin star restaurant

09:49.440 --> 09:52.400
and opening my own place
was a dream of mine.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.080
[Ruth] We're so excited.
It's everything now.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.240
We've quit our jobs

09:55.280 --> 09:56.680
-to pursue this.
-You have quit your job?

09:57.040 --> 09:58.520
Yeah.

09:58.560 --> 10:00.480
If you quit an establishment
like the Ritz to pursue this,

10:00.520 --> 10:01.920
you've got to be
pretty confident.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.360
So, tell me, what is
the experience going
to be like

10:04.400 --> 10:06.440
for a guest coming in
through that door?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.120
We want it to kind of
be very homely.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.760
We just want to give you
really good food,
really good wine,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.400
and make sure
that comes together.

10:12.440 --> 10:16.080
What you've told me now
just requires
incredible organization,

10:16.120 --> 10:19.200
incredible timing
and communication

10:19.240 --> 10:21.480
-between the kitchen
and the front.
-Yeah.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.080
But we know each other,
and we can,
even just with a look,

10:24.120 --> 10:27.280
we can kind of, like...
[chuckles] Tell what she's
saying, you know.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.800
Listen, girls, I think I better
let you get on with it,
'cause you are so busy.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.640
-I better start cooking
some food.
-Good luck.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.240
-Thank you. Nice to meet you.
-Take care. See you later.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.760
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.560
[narrator] Halfway
through day one,

10:39.600 --> 10:43.360
ShrimpWreck and Epoch
have each brought
a core team with them,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.720
and they're busy prepping.

10:45.760 --> 10:50.520
Tomorrow, in just 24 hours,
the investors will be arriving
for lunch.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.360
Do you want to have
a wee gander?

10:52.400 --> 10:55.120
[narrator]
So, tonight, they will open
to the Manchester public

10:55.160 --> 10:57.560
for their one and only
practice run.

10:58.280 --> 10:59.960
[Fred] I'm very excited.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.120
The two restaurants
are getting ready
for their soft launch.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.280
Soft launch
is a very well-known
and established practice

11:04.320 --> 11:05.880
in the restaurant industry.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.680
For both of them,
it's their chance to do
one dry run

11:08.720 --> 11:11.920
before the investors
turn up tomorrow.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.360
It's gonna allow them
to iron all the creases out.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.080
It's gotta be smooth.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.320
[Ewen] In ShrimpWreck,
Ewen wants to deliver

11:18.360 --> 11:21.080
a sit-down
restaurant experience,

11:21.120 --> 11:23.720
so he's decided to offer
eleven items.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.840
Almost double his usual menu.

11:25.880 --> 11:30.400
His mains, the shrimp bun,
fish finger sarnie,
and fish tacos

11:30.440 --> 11:33.560
will all sell for £7.50 each.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.680
[Ewen] That's the shrimp bun.

11:36.720 --> 11:38.560
-[Fred] Yeah.
-Here, we've got
the fish finger sarnie.

11:38.600 --> 11:39.920
How many covers have you got?

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
Sixty-one tonight.

11:41.000 --> 11:41.960
Sixty-one?

11:43.680 --> 11:45.440
-You're joking?
-No.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.400
Well, you've got
your work cut out.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.840
-We'll be okay.
-[chuckles]

11:50.320 --> 11:51.880
[Fred] I really like
Ewen's concept.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.120
The question for me is,

11:53.160 --> 11:55.320
can he translate
that street food sensation

11:55.360 --> 11:56.800
into a restaurant?

11:56.840 --> 11:59.480
Does he have what it takes
to run an operation,

11:59.520 --> 12:03.200
to pay attention to details
and keep 61 customers happy

12:03.240 --> 12:04.720
all at the same time?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.480
Do you want me to just
pop some butter in?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.040
-Yep.
-All right.

12:10.080 --> 12:13.240
[narrator]
Ruth and Emily believe
they'd need £600,000

12:13.280 --> 12:16.640
to get Epoch set up
and cover costs for a year

12:16.680 --> 12:18.600
before it makes a profit.

12:18.640 --> 12:23.440
But with fine dining like this,
nothing comes cheap.

12:23.480 --> 12:27.680
Most of the smaller dishes,
for example, the cauliflower,
the eel, and the scallop

12:27.720 --> 12:30.040
are between £15 and £18.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.960
The main courses are
£20 to £27.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
We want to support
British suppliers,

12:37.040 --> 12:40.800
the small-scale people
who are gonna find it hard
to sustain themselves.

12:40.840 --> 12:44.080
So, for example,
the scallops are hand dived,
it's not dredged.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.040
And the grouse,
for example, is £26,

12:47.080 --> 12:49.200
which people might think
is crazy.

12:49.240 --> 12:52.880
But it's a bird
that's only available
for three months of the year,

12:52.920 --> 12:54.240
and that's why we've come
to these prices.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.520
[narrator] These dishes
sound expensive,

12:57.560 --> 13:01.400
but there's a real appetite
for Epoch's style of food
and wine.

13:01.440 --> 13:06.880
The fine dining sector
is one of the fastest-growing
markets in the UK.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.160
[Ewen] Right, I'm gonna
get started on the fish.

13:09.840 --> 13:12.200
[narrator] Experienced
waiting staff from Manchester

13:12.240 --> 13:14.880
are joining
the restaurant teams to help
with tonight's service.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.160
-How are we doing?
-Ewen.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.600
-Jo. Nice to meet ya.
-Sal.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.840
-Sal.
-Nice meeting you.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.200
Sorry. My name's Emily.
Lovely to meet you.

13:20.240 --> 13:22.000
-Emily. I'm Ron.
Nice to meet you.
-I'm Vesh.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.000
It's lovely to meet you.

13:24.040 --> 13:27.320
[narrator] With hours to go,
both restaurants are holding
a staff briefing

13:27.360 --> 13:30.760
to tell everyone about the menu
and how things should run.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.440
[Ewen] Basically, the food.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.240
The shrimp bun,
that's this one here.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.960
They're kind of...
They're presented
like open sandwiches.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.680
Tacos are grilled.

13:39.720 --> 13:43.440
And the fish finger sarnie
is kind of just pretty
self-explanatory.

13:43.480 --> 13:45.520
[Ruth] Okay, so this dish
is a scallop dish.

13:45.560 --> 13:47.720
So you've got
the raw scallop,
obviously.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.400
And then, this is raw,
so the tartar

13:50.440 --> 13:52.440
is mixed with buttermilk
and chives.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.440
-What's tartar?
-Tartar, like beef tartar.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.360
Like, it's raw and diced.

13:59.040 --> 13:59.960
[chuckles]

14:02.280 --> 14:05.240
This is pretty new
to me as well, so...

14:05.280 --> 14:08.400
[chuckles] Ask me questions
if you like, and I'll try
and answer them.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.560
[Ruth] This one
is the smoked eel.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.160
[man] So, is this all cold?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.800
I don't really like fish,
or cold fish.

14:14.840 --> 14:18.000
[man] Well, chacun a son gout,
as they say.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.800
-[Ron] What?
-[man] Oh, it's, "each
to their own taste," in French.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.560
-It's British in here, though.
-Oh, sorry.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.280
[servers laugh]

14:26.320 --> 14:29.240
Wow. They only talked
about the food and the wine.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.720
They were perfect at that.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.120
We just wanted to say
thank you so much,

14:33.160 --> 14:35.480
and we're really excited
for tonight.
It's gonna be amazing.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.120
The thing that they failed
to do is talk about
how the restaurant

14:38.160 --> 14:39.880
is going to run tonight.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.040
What's gonna happen
when the customers
go through that door?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.960
What happen when they sit down?

14:44.000 --> 14:47.760
I mean, these are very simple
but very crucial
pieces of information

14:47.800 --> 14:49.000
for the team.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.560
I have no idea
what's going to happen
in here.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.560
Good evening.
Hi, how are you?

15:04.600 --> 15:05.840
Welcome to Epoch.
How are we all?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.520
Hey, guys.
How are we doing?

15:07.560 --> 15:08.760
-Not too bad.
-Yeah.

15:08.800 --> 15:11.000
From my own experience,
I know how stressful

15:11.040 --> 15:12.480
a first night can be.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.760
Three fish tacos,
veggie nuggets

15:14.800 --> 15:16.760
-and a buffalo prawns.
-[man] Yeah.

15:16.800 --> 15:18.840
[Fred] We all think
it's romantic and fun...

15:20.200 --> 15:21.560
-Hey, guys, are you okay?
-[Fred] ...it's not.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.040
It's like a battle.
It's blood, sweat and tears.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.080
[narrator] Tonight will be
no gentle introduction.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.200
Soft launches
are for half-priced food...

15:32.240 --> 15:34.280
Would you like to have a look
at the wine list at all?

15:34.320 --> 15:38.040
...so both restaurants
are fully booked twice over.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.720
[woman] Two veggie burgers.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.160
If you need
anything else at all, guys,
just give me a shout.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.840
[man] Welcome to Epoch.

15:42.880 --> 15:47.040
[narrator]
After just an hour open,
Epoch is running behind.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.600
Guys, guys, I'm gonna
get stressed in a second.

15:48.640 --> 15:50.800
John, have you swapped pads?

15:50.840 --> 15:53.320
Well, I had to...
I moved down there
and forgot about...

15:53.360 --> 15:54.520
Oh, shit, was that me?

15:54.560 --> 15:55.880
[Ruth] They've only took
one table's orders.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.360
They're in the shit now.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.720
Emily looks stressed.

16:04.640 --> 16:05.840
[waitress] Sorry.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.840
If you need to jump on
and take orders, do it,

16:08.880 --> 16:11.400
because people are waiting.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.000
Yeah. There's only one order
been placed and a lot
of people see it,

16:14.040 --> 16:17.320
so if somebody doesn't start
taking orders, we're gonna get
slammed in here.

16:17.360 --> 16:21.160
So somebody needs to take
some orders.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.880
We should not be stressing
this much.

16:22.920 --> 16:24.480
One more sole.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.640
-How are you doing, Vesh?
-I'm fine, yeah.

16:26.680 --> 16:29.840
Can you do water
on the end table?

16:29.880 --> 16:31.520
-Table one.
-Table one. Okay.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.640
-Table one, tap water, please.
-Yeah.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.960
-How's it going?
-Nobody seems to know
the table numbers.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.840
-Really?
-Someone's just shouting drinks
at me, and then I make them.

16:38.880 --> 16:41.200
Then, which customers get what?

16:41.240 --> 16:45.280
I'm sorry. D, could you
take down two red wine glasses

16:45.320 --> 16:48.160
on table two for me,
and I'll follow you
with the red wine.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.800
-No, no, do your thing.
-[laughs] Sorry.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.840
-Two red wine glasses.
-Yeah.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.360
And that's the water
that you asked for.

16:54.400 --> 16:57.040
And do I need to bring
the red wine
out to table one?

16:57.080 --> 17:00.320
Uh, to table...
No, this one is for table two.

17:00.360 --> 17:01.640
[Fred] There is a rule
in restaurants.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.720
Only ever give one job
at a time to one person.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.800
Emily just gave two
in the space of ten seconds.
Not good.

17:09.080 --> 17:11.320
-Need some more drinks?
-[woman] Let's find out.

17:11.360 --> 17:13.320
[Fred] So did you deliver
this water to the right table?

17:13.360 --> 17:14.720
[waitress] I hope so.
I'm gonna guess that...

17:14.760 --> 17:16.640
-And where are you going
on this one?
-I don't know.

17:16.680 --> 17:17.560
Okay, go like that.

17:18.840 --> 17:20.160
[waitress] Three more scallops,
yeah?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.960
[waiter] The truffle...
I'm going to explain that.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.880
[Ruth] Are you taking this
to table eight?
[Emily] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:23.920 --> 17:27.040
[Emily] No, no, no,
not table eight.
Not table eight.

17:27.080 --> 17:31.440
Their food's been outstanding,
but front of house service,
it's just appalling.

17:31.480 --> 17:34.840
The food itself,
and the combinations,
the flavors were really good.

17:34.880 --> 17:37.000
[customer] I know it's their
first time this evening,

17:37.040 --> 17:39.440
but I'd be upset
paying full price
with this service.

17:39.480 --> 17:41.400
Not the food.
The food, it was lovely.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.480
-Two grouse.
-[John] Where to?

17:43.520 --> 17:45.440
Right. You are going to...

17:45.480 --> 17:47.600
[Ruth] I don't know
what table it is because
it doesn't say anything.

17:50.800 --> 17:54.680
Ewen, we've got another check.
Two veggie buns,
buffalo shrimp.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.160
That's it.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.480
[narrator] Ewen's
about to road test ShrimpWreck

17:58.520 --> 18:00.920
before the investors' lunch
tomorrow.

18:00.960 --> 18:01.840
-Would you like spicy?
-Yeah, yeah.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
Buffalo?

18:04.360 --> 18:06.440
Hey, guys. Here you go.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.480
[Ewen] So we've got
a sharing plate
and the buffalo prawns.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.240
Delicious.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.200
[customer] Even somebody
who doesn't like fish

18:13.240 --> 18:15.560
would like that
fish finger butty.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.480
It was just gorgeous.
It was really, really good.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.000
-[Fred] How are you, Ewen?
-I'm good.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.200
-Are you happy?
-Yeah, really happy.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.320
We seem to have everything
under control.

18:23.360 --> 18:25.120
[Fred] How many covered
so far?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.120
I couldn't even know.
Should I know?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.800
[both laughing]

18:29.840 --> 18:34.360
No, just to think about
how many you have now
and how many more to come.

18:34.400 --> 18:38.240
Yeah, that's a good idea. Just
maybe I'll go
and count them out now.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.400
Despite my worries,
it's going very well in here,

18:43.440 --> 18:46.280
simply because the concept
is so simple.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.920
And they've got it sussed out
in this kitchen.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.160
[call bell dings]

18:51.200 --> 18:53.280
[Emily] I'm so sorry.
Were you not happy
with the service?

18:53.320 --> 18:56.680
-Between the first main
and the last was an hour, so...
-Yeah.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.520
First main and the last main
was an hour?

19:00.200 --> 19:03.400
I was hoping it was gonna go
a lot smoother than it did.

19:03.440 --> 19:06.760
I think I tried to take on
too many roles.

19:06.800 --> 19:10.480
Instead of looking after one
of the stations, which I did,

19:10.520 --> 19:12.840
I should have been more
taking a managerial role,

19:12.880 --> 19:15.520
making sure
everything was smooth
coming from the kitchen

19:15.560 --> 19:16.720
to the restaurant.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.480
You did, kind of,
back yourselves up a bit.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.760
-At the beginning.
-Yeah.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.520
We need to hit
the ground running.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.080
It's been quite tough
as best friends, actually.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.800
because you can see each other,
like, struggling,

19:24.840 --> 19:26.440
and you just want to go
and, like, give them a big hug.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.440
And obviously you can't.
You gotta stay professional.

19:42.680 --> 19:46.280
[Fred] Today, Epoch
and ShrimpWreck
are preparing for a lunch

19:46.320 --> 19:48.240
that could change
their lives.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.560
The investors are coming,
and they want to know
two things.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.880
One, is the food good enough?

19:53.920 --> 19:57.360
And two, can they be trusted
as people?

19:57.400 --> 20:00.080
Will they deliver?
Have they got what it takes?

20:02.320 --> 20:04.720
[Ewen] You know,
they're here because
they like the concept.

20:04.760 --> 20:08.640
So I just need to put
across that I can do the job,

20:08.680 --> 20:12.040
and that's what we're working
towards just now,

20:12.080 --> 20:13.960
making sure
it all runs smoothly.

20:15.480 --> 20:18.120
Next, you wanna do the butter?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.360
I'm feeling
quite good today, actually.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.600
Maybe a little more nervous,
but, uh...

20:22.640 --> 20:24.520
Excited as well.

20:24.560 --> 20:28.520
[narrator] They may be young,
but Ruth and Emily have already
made history,

20:28.560 --> 20:31.920
and that's why they've
chosen their name.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.200
[Ruth] Epoch
actually means the start
of a historical period.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.800
So, within our professions,
we both think
we're kind of helping to,

20:38.840 --> 20:41.520
I don't know,
get the ball rolling

20:41.560 --> 20:43.720
with moving women forward
in the industry.

20:43.760 --> 20:46.760
She was the first female
to ever win Young National
Chef of the Year.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.800
Presentation
is absolutely everything.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.520
I was actually the first
female sommelier ever
at the Ritz,

20:51.560 --> 20:53.040
since 1906,

20:53.080 --> 20:55.560
so I'm very proud
of saying that.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.360
It's nice to kind of hope
you change people's views,

20:58.400 --> 21:01.120
on women in hospitality.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.800
And I think
it's mainly being told
we can't do it is why

21:04.840 --> 21:07.040
-we want to do it even more.
-[chuckles]
Biggest drive, yeah.

21:07.080 --> 21:10.280
No, no, no.
No cutlery on any tables,
just the butter knife.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.800
[narrator]
Over the next few days,

21:12.840 --> 21:15.400
the investors will test
the restaurants'
customer service

21:15.440 --> 21:16.800
and business plans.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.680
But their private lunch today
is all about the food.

21:24.800 --> 21:29.440
Epoch is hosting
Michelin star restaurateur
Atul Kochhar,

21:29.480 --> 21:33.960
who's looking to expand
his UK restaurant portfolio.

21:34.000 --> 21:37.240
I became the first
Indian chef to get
a Michelin star, in 2001,

21:37.280 --> 21:39.360
and have never looked back.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.520
I am actually looking
to invest in new concepts,

21:41.560 --> 21:43.280
but also the new cuisines.

21:43.320 --> 21:47.440
For example, last five years
we have been crazy
about casual dining.

21:47.480 --> 21:51.000
But I do believe that
people would want to go back
to fine dining.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.160
Amazing food,
fantastic service,
great wine list.

21:54.200 --> 21:57.920
But what people don't realize,
that it's very
investment-heavy business.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.760
If I'm looking
for a restaurant in London,

21:59.800 --> 22:03.080
I need to have
a million pounds in my pocket
before I open my mouth.

22:06.080 --> 22:10.480
[narrator] Joining him,
international five-star
hotelier Lydia Forte,

22:10.520 --> 22:15.440
with hotels in London,
Edinburgh, and across Europe.

22:15.480 --> 22:21.480
For them to impress me,
I need to see that the quality
of the food,

22:21.520 --> 22:24.400
and the wine list
they are offering
is excellent.

22:24.440 --> 22:28.160
I also want to see
that they're organized

22:28.200 --> 22:31.280
and that they've thought
this pop-up through properly,

22:31.320 --> 22:34.880
and that they can deliver
a certain level of service.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.160
[Atul] Their CVs read
like a dream, to be honest.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.200
And they both believe
in British food
and British wines.

22:40.240 --> 22:42.880
It has never been done before.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.920
[Lydia] If I find a concept
I think is really great,

22:45.960 --> 22:49.240
I'll be fighting for it.
It's hard to find
really good concepts.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.960
[Atul] I'm not here
for gambling, I'm here for
the next great business idea.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.760
-Hi. Miss Forte?
-Hi. Yes.

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
-Hello.
-Hi. Lydia.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.520
-Lovely to meet you.
-[Atul] Hello.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.960
[Emily]
If you'd like to follow me,
I'll take you to your table.

23:06.720 --> 23:08.400
[narrator] Lunch today
could mean the difference

23:08.440 --> 23:11.200
between Epoch opening
as a full-time restaurant

23:11.240 --> 23:14.880
or Emily and Ruth
looking for new jobs.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.080
-Here's the menu for you.
-Thank you very much.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.920
[Emily] Everything
is locally-sourced.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.680
So, for instance,
peppercorn isn't British,

23:20.720 --> 23:25.840
so we dehydrate horseradish
and use that
as a peppery alternative.

23:25.880 --> 23:31.200
[narrator] On today's menu,
scallops, grouse, sole
and lamb loin,

23:31.240 --> 23:34.080
all paired with exclusive
English wines.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.880
[Lydia] What's one
of the dishes that really
defines your concept?

23:36.920 --> 23:37.880
-Defines Epoch?
-[Lydia] Yeah.

23:37.920 --> 23:40.240
I would probably say
the grouse.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.000
Because it's
kind of game season.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.760
It's quite traditional
and quite important.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.000
-[Lydia] I really like grouse--
-Yeah.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.280
-...and it's actually very--
-[clicks tongue]

23:48.320 --> 23:49.680
-It's very gamey.
-It's quite hard to do well,

23:49.720 --> 23:50.880
-so I'd be interested
to try that.
-[Emily] Yeah.

23:50.920 --> 23:53.080
Absolutely. I second that.
Love it.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.520
-Scallop as well.
-Scallop is lovely.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.720
I'm gonna send the scallops
with the Hindleap,

23:57.760 --> 24:00.760
and then I'll also give you
the Gusbourne pinot noir,

24:00.800 --> 24:03.520
which goes really well
with the grouse
and the truffle.

24:03.560 --> 24:07.760
Would you ever consider
not having a purely British
wine list?

24:07.800 --> 24:11.640
I don't think I would
because then it completely
takes away from our concept.

24:11.680 --> 24:12.960
[Atul] The concept
you stand for.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.760
We're gonna do what we do well,

24:14.800 --> 24:17.480
and we're gonna
change the dishes
to match the wines.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.640
-She's lovely.
-Lovely.

24:21.680 --> 24:23.360
-How she--
-And lots of product knowledge.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.680
-Lots of knowledge,
really passionate.
-Really passionate.

24:32.520 --> 24:36.600
[narrator] In ShrimpWreck,
Ewen is preparing for his
make-or-break investor lunch.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.240
I need to make sure the food

24:41.280 --> 24:43.480
is as good as it always is.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.160
That's the first priority
for me.

24:46.680 --> 24:49.080
[narrator] On his guest list,
one of Britain's

24:49.120 --> 24:52.520
most successful investors,
David Page.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.720
He's grown some of the UK's
biggest brands,

24:55.760 --> 25:00.960
including Pizza Express,
Gourmet Burger Kitchen
and Franco Manca.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.760
[David] What we like doing
is getting involved

25:02.800 --> 25:04.160
in businesses that have
very low pricing

25:04.200 --> 25:07.000
and very high quality,
so they are quite easy to run.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.480
And we have lots of customers
because of that.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.480
There is a straight-line graph
in the UK,

25:12.520 --> 25:16.840
it's called number of units
you can open in the UK,

25:16.880 --> 25:19.160
and it's entirely driven
by price.

25:19.880 --> 25:21.080
So if your Happy Meal

25:21.440 --> 25:24.000
is 99p,

25:24.040 --> 25:27.800
you can open 2,500,
3,000 stores in the UK.

25:27.840 --> 25:32.040
If you are an Ivy,
and you are
£50 or £60 a head,

25:32.080 --> 25:34.600
you can possibly open
a maximum of 30.

25:36.560 --> 25:39.360
[narrator] Joining him
is Scott Collins,

25:39.400 --> 25:42.800
co-founder of burger
and cocktail group MEATliquor.

25:44.360 --> 25:45.600
I think
in this financial climate

25:45.640 --> 25:47.000
when people are going out
more than ever

25:47.040 --> 25:48.400
they look for value for money,

25:48.440 --> 25:51.960
and that will be
the food, the drink,
the service.

25:52.000 --> 25:55.400
I'm interested in ShrimpWreck
because he thinks he can open

25:55.440 --> 25:56.960
a restaurant for £100,000.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.200
If he can,
it's quite a good trick,

25:59.240 --> 26:01.040
so I'm looking forward
to learning that.

26:01.080 --> 26:03.120
-Hello Ewen.
-[Ewen] Hi, I'm Ewen.

26:03.160 --> 26:04.440
-David.
-[Ewen] Nice to meet ya.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.560
-How are you doing?
-Scott. Scott.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.080
-How are you?
-I'm good, I'm good.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.400
Come take a seat over here.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.680
-Best table in the house.
-[David] Good.

26:11.720 --> 26:13.480
[Ewen] [laughs] Yes.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.080
So, we've got our menu here.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.320
The three mains
that we do in the van,

26:18.360 --> 26:22.920
are the shrimp bun,
the fish tacos,
the fish finger sarnie.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.280
And we do squid,
and we also do buffalo prawns.

26:25.320 --> 26:29.320
And everything that you do here
is exactly the same recipe
as what you do from the van?

26:29.360 --> 26:31.240
[Ewen] Yes.

26:31.280 --> 26:35.240
[narrator]
On today's lunch menu,
a sharing platter for two.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.480
[waitress]
Got some fries for you.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.560
So you've got
your fish finger
sandwiches,

26:38.600 --> 26:41.440
your two mini shrimp buns,
squid, tacos

26:41.480 --> 26:42.760
and a buffalo sauce
as well.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.320
I'll just grab you
some side plates as well.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.800
Squid first, I reckon.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.840
[Scott] Perhaps, on that,
but I wouldn't use a dip.

26:51.880 --> 26:53.120
-Which one did you have?
-I didn't. I had a bite.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.800
-Oh, you didn't.
-I had it blind.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.120
[both laughing]

26:59.160 --> 27:00.480
-It's a good thing I like salt.
-Christ.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.880
Good thing I like salt.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.280
-[Scott] It's just your doctor
that doesn't.
-No.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.200
And has this got
not any salt on it?

27:06.240 --> 27:08.800
-Presumably chili,
or something?
-That's Cajun spice.

27:08.840 --> 27:11.200
Cajun spice, is it? Oh.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.760
[Ewen] Put a sharing plate on
so they can try a bit of the...

27:14.800 --> 27:16.520
The whole lot of the menu.

27:16.560 --> 27:20.640
And, uh,
I'm sure they'll enjoy it.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.920
Can I say that's so salty

27:21.960 --> 27:23.240
-I'm not going to have
any more of it?
-Yep.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.280
-Wow!
-Thank you.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.520
So we have the grouse,
uh, pickled blackberries,

27:32.560 --> 27:35.080
some roasted chestnuts,
celery.

27:35.120 --> 27:37.240
And then I've kept the sauce
quite light, but with the wine.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.560
[Lydia] That's beautiful.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.200
Beautifully cooked.
Beautifully presented.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.760
That's the way to cook it.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.880
-[Ruth] Did we pour sauce
on the grouse?
-[Emily] Yeah.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.640
Did I?
I did. Definitely.

27:51.520 --> 27:53.560
I can't remember.
It doesn't look like I did.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.280
[Emily] So leave it.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.800
[Ruth] Just check,
I don't know.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.240
[Emily]
It's very quiet over here.

28:12.280 --> 28:15.320
-I mean--
-Was there supposed to be
gravy with that or...

28:15.360 --> 28:16.760
Uh, yes,
I think the sauce was--

28:16.800 --> 28:17.840
-[Atul] Oh, that was...
-Yeah.

28:17.880 --> 28:18.960
Very gentle. Okay.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.280
Wold you...
Would you like some more?

28:20.320 --> 28:21.560
-Can I just grab a bit more?
-Yes, of course.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.600
[Atul] Just want to
try it a bit.

28:22.640 --> 28:23.600
Could we have
a little more sauce?

28:30.600 --> 28:34.200
They were like,
"Is there any gravy on it?"
I was like, "There is."

28:35.120 --> 28:35.960
Fight through it.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.920
Genuinely surprised
by how good this is.

28:51.960 --> 28:56.600
It's attention to detail,
the flavor, the texture,

28:56.640 --> 28:58.480
the combination of ingredients.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.440
Very, very accomplished
cooking.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.320
[Ruth] How was everything?
[laughs nervously]

29:02.360 --> 29:04.520
Chef, that dish was amazing.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.160
-It was really delicious.
-Amazing.

29:06.200 --> 29:09.320
Only one complaint,
it was too small.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.560
-[Lydia] Oh, no!
-[both chuckling]

29:11.680 --> 29:14.000
First impressions of Epoch,

29:14.040 --> 29:15.480
it actually blew me away.

29:15.520 --> 29:18.840
I was so impressed
by how young they both are,

29:18.880 --> 29:20.280
yet, the quality

29:20.320 --> 29:23.120
of food, and the quality
of the whole offering,

29:23.160 --> 29:25.880
including the wine they have
managed to present.

29:25.920 --> 29:30.680
I wouldn't blink if I saw that
food in a two Michelin star
restaurant tomorrow.

29:30.720 --> 29:33.120
You become a chef
because you want to make
somebody happy,

29:33.160 --> 29:34.920
like, above everything.

29:34.960 --> 29:40.240
Um, so to actually see
that initial reaction
is super important.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.960
She might be 22,
but she cooks like somebody
who's 45.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.480
Her understanding,
her depth, her precision

29:47.520 --> 29:49.760
is just mind-boggling,
to be honest.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.360
I'm blown away.

29:51.400 --> 29:55.480
-Thank you.
-Thank you, girls.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.920
As a customer,
you couldn't have
a better experience.

29:59.200 --> 30:00.480
As an investor,

30:01.840 --> 30:04.560
it is still very possible
that it doesn't stack up.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.480
I've got issues with everything
I've tasted so far.

30:10.520 --> 30:12.080
Some of them aren't positive.

30:13.880 --> 30:16.480
[Scott] That has got
too much salt on.

30:16.520 --> 30:20.320
-The taco is... That is just--
-[David] Yeah, it's terrible.

30:20.360 --> 30:22.400
[Scott] Supermarket bought.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.640
And this, I can't taste
anything but salt.

30:24.680 --> 30:27.960
-And these aren't
sweet potatoes, right?
-[David] Who prepared that?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.200
[Ewen] Uh...

30:29.240 --> 30:30.960
-Have... Have you tried it?
-Come over and...

30:35.600 --> 30:37.640
The, uh...

30:37.680 --> 30:41.880
Do you think the quality
of the fish and the prawns that
you've got are really good?

30:41.920 --> 30:44.160
-[Scott] And the cooking,
of it--
-Mmm-hmm?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.880
[David] What's happened there?

30:45.920 --> 30:48.720
-It's very, very salty.
-Mmm-hmm, yeah.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.080
[David] And it dominates,
actually, the quality
of the ingredient.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.720
Is that how you'd like it?

30:55.760 --> 30:57.040
It's not.

30:57.080 --> 30:58.560
This is all new
to me, you know.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.280
I'm not...
I'm not a trained chef.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.280
[David] I was disappointed
when I took my first mouthful.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.840
It was such a powerful taste
for me,

31:06.880 --> 31:12.360
that it rather destroyed
my palate for everything else
I had during the whole meal.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.440
[Scott] I mean, the guy
is relatively new
to the business.

31:15.480 --> 31:18.040
You know, he could have
fallen at the first hurdle,
but he didn't.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.080
He seemed open
to criticism,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.600
which was just as well.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.200
Thanks very much for your time.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.040
[Ewen]
They were a bit disappointed
by a couple of dishes.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.360
It was
a few negative comments,

31:27.400 --> 31:28.800
but they were such easy tweaks.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.640
And I'm willing to work
with it,

31:30.680 --> 31:33.040
if it means...

31:33.080 --> 31:35.920
...being more successful,
having more successful
business.

31:36.680 --> 31:37.560
It's easy fixes.

31:51.960 --> 31:54.320
[Fred] The investors
have now tried the food.

31:54.360 --> 31:56.400
Very good feedback
for Ruth and Emily.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.280
I'm afraid,
not so good for Ewen.

32:00.080 --> 32:01.400
[narrator]
Tomorrow lunchtime,

32:01.440 --> 32:03.560
the restaurants will open
to the public again,

32:03.600 --> 32:05.960
and the investors will watch
their every move.

32:07.800 --> 32:13.320
But Ruth and Emily
and Ewen still have
more work to do today.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.440
[Fred] They have
a high-powered meeting
with the investors

32:15.480 --> 32:18.320
to review the financials
and the business plan.

32:18.360 --> 32:22.640
The figures have to stack up,
otherwise it might well be
game over tonight.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.440
[narrator] Over half
of all new restaurants

32:24.480 --> 32:26.560
fail within
the first two years,

32:26.600 --> 32:31.480
so Ruth and Emily need to prove
they are worth the £600,000
they are asking for.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.280
[Lydia] It could be
the greatest lunch
I've ever had,

32:34.320 --> 32:38.320
but if the financials
don't add up,

32:38.360 --> 32:40.560
then it's a no for me.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.200
[narrator] As the investors
are in competition
with each other,

32:43.240 --> 32:45.640
they'll each have
an hour alone
with the operators

32:45.680 --> 32:48.840
to interrogate
their financial plans.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.000
I think the biggest concern
about both of them
would be the inexperience.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.640
But, I guess, that's where
people like me come in.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.040
And we can help them,
mentor them,

32:57.080 --> 32:59.880
and run the business
with them, for them,

32:59.920 --> 33:03.520
but, you know,
if they don't make mistakes,
they're not gonna grow.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.480
I went through your deck.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.240
One thing, obviously,
is missing, is the financials.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.920
Okay?

33:15.960 --> 33:20.000
What average spends
would you see for lunch
versus for dinner?

33:20.040 --> 33:22.000
In a realistic world.

33:22.040 --> 33:26.000
About 65, 70 for lunch,
and then around 90 for dinner.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.960
So 70 for lunch
is quite a lot
even for Mayfair.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.560
And how would you
break it down then,
that £70 for lunch?

33:32.600 --> 33:38.040
About £40 for food, roughly,
and about £20 for beverage.

33:38.080 --> 33:43.000
Okay, so that's
a glass and a half,
and a coffee.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.560
-No coffee.
-No coffee. Oh, yeah.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.560
Not... Not British.

33:50.720 --> 33:52.640
Their brand name
is not well-known

33:52.680 --> 33:55.440
and we would probably
have to put a lot
into marketing them.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.600
But, I think
their story is sellable,

33:57.640 --> 33:59.760
and I think we can make
something out of that.

33:59.800 --> 34:02.120
If we were to go forward,
would you be investing?

34:03.800 --> 34:07.200
-As in?
-Would you have any money
to invest in the place?

34:07.240 --> 34:09.120
-Yeah, definitely.
-[Atul] Financially.

34:09.160 --> 34:12.360
Obviously, it'd be
something we can discuss,

34:12.400 --> 34:14.320
I think we've both
got money that...

34:14.360 --> 34:16.840
Like, obviously, depending
on what was offered,

34:16.880 --> 34:21.080
we can find or...
What we have already
could be expanded on.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.440
When my business partner

34:25.480 --> 34:27.720
asked me to invest,
I was penniless,

34:27.760 --> 34:30.000
but I re-mortgaged my house,

34:30.040 --> 34:32.000
and I put 50,000
in the business.

34:32.040 --> 34:35.320
And I know how much
it can motivate a person

34:35.360 --> 34:37.920
to keep that place going
because it means...

34:37.960 --> 34:39.560
That's the livelihood,
that's all you have.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.720
[narrator] At the end
of the meeting,

34:43.760 --> 34:46.200
the investors can choose
to spell out the offer
they'll make

34:46.240 --> 34:50.400
if, and only if, they decide
to invest tomorrow.

34:50.440 --> 34:56.280
The way that I would invest
if the experience tomorrow
really goes well,

34:56.320 --> 34:58.880
and after a lot more thought
on our side,

34:58.920 --> 35:02.920
to bring you in
to one of our luxury
five-star hotels.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.600
You would get
full-time salaries,

35:07.640 --> 35:12.600
and on top of that
we would pay you a small fee
for the brand and the concept.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.160
And then we would offer
a percentage of profits.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.440
And our expected return
would have to be, ideally,
within about three years,

35:20.480 --> 35:23.120
because, obviously,
we could be investing
half a million in it.

35:23.160 --> 35:28.040
That would be, more or less,
the type of offer
that we'd want to make.

35:28.080 --> 35:30.920
Yeah, that's
such an exciting offer.

35:30.960 --> 35:35.200
Definitely something
that we would be interested in.

35:35.240 --> 35:39.600
I'm very positive
about them now,
as of today.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.200
I think a huge amount rests
on how they perform tomorrow.

35:43.920 --> 35:46.120
Going forward...

35:46.160 --> 35:51.560
If I was to invest in this,
I think you're looking
at easily £750,000.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.840
Okay? It will take
about that much.

35:54.880 --> 35:59.240
But that's the level
of investment I would feel
comfortable going with you two.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.240
You feel comfortable with that?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.640
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.600
I'm really looking
forward to tomorrow,

36:04.640 --> 36:08.360
to see how you work
with a roomful of people.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.440
Tomorrow's service would be
the deciding factor for me.

36:10.480 --> 36:14.920
Every business, whether it's
a coffee shop or
three Michelin star restaurant,

36:14.960 --> 36:16.920
if they cannot be consistent,

36:16.960 --> 36:18.800
they will not survive.

36:18.840 --> 36:22.480
[Lydia] If Atul and I
are both interested,

36:22.520 --> 36:25.360
I think our offers
would both be

36:25.400 --> 36:26.840
quite different.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.840
And...

36:28.880 --> 36:33.040
It remains up to
Emily and Ruth to decide,

36:33.080 --> 36:35.440
you know, which offer
interests them most.

36:35.480 --> 36:36.360
Let's see.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.120
A lot to play for tomorrow.

36:40.520 --> 36:43.720
Atul potentially offering,
like, £750,000...

36:43.760 --> 36:45.880
-It's, yeah, amazing.
-Um...

36:45.920 --> 36:48.280
Obviously, then we have to put
money in ourselves as well,

36:48.320 --> 36:50.920
but is that worth it?
Does that make us
want it more?

36:50.960 --> 36:54.400
Lydia's offering, obviously,
everything, salary--

36:54.440 --> 36:55.560
[Emily] I can't
even comprehend it.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.680
Like, pinch me.
It's so surreal.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.960
We have to smash tomorrow now.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.320
Well, the pressure is on.
But I'm so proud of you, okay?

37:02.360 --> 37:04.640
-Okay, you, too.
-Okay, I love you.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.440
[narrator]
Now, it's Ewen's turn.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.480
He's asking for £100,000.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.680
After serious problems
with the food earlier,

37:17.720 --> 37:20.480
his business plan
will need to be convincing.

37:20.520 --> 37:21.720
-Hiya.
-How are you doing?

37:21.760 --> 37:22.600
I'm okay.

37:26.160 --> 37:28.240
Um...

37:28.280 --> 37:32.040
As you can tell, I was really
looking forward to lunch.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.440
In the first bite
it was rather a shock horror,

37:34.480 --> 37:36.800
-because it somehow
destroyed the--
-Uh-huh.

37:36.840 --> 37:40.160
The over-salted squid.

37:40.200 --> 37:41.840
Um...

37:41.880 --> 37:45.280
You know, [stammers]
I'm not focusing on
these negative things,

37:45.320 --> 37:46.520
that, you know,
have been brought up.

37:46.560 --> 37:49.320
And I want to tweak
a couple of things.

37:49.360 --> 37:52.240
See the customers' reaction,
if they're still enjoying
the food

37:52.280 --> 37:53.600
as much as they did
the first night.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.680
These figures, I've spent

37:58.720 --> 38:00.840
a lot of time with them.

38:00.880 --> 38:05.200
My very first restaurant,
that cost 250,000.

38:05.240 --> 38:09.960
My last restaurant
cost 450,000.

38:10.000 --> 38:14.120
I'd be surprised if anyone
could open a restaurant
for £100,000.

38:16.560 --> 38:18.120
I've got genuine interest
in him,

38:18.160 --> 38:21.840
whether it's helping him or
going into business, we'll see

38:21.880 --> 38:23.840
in the next 24 hours, I guess.

38:23.880 --> 38:24.920
-Pleasure's all mine.
-Thanks.

38:24.960 --> 38:26.840
-Cheers, mate.
-See you later on.

38:26.880 --> 38:30.000
I've made a lot of mistakes,
and I'd be very happy
to share them with him.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.480
And they're probably worth
a lot of money because they
lost me a lot of money.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.960
What is your net food cost?

38:35.720 --> 38:37.520
Shrimp bun, for example.

38:37.560 --> 38:40.120
It costs me 1.80. £1.80.

38:40.160 --> 38:41.520
-To construct the whole thing?
-Yeah.

38:41.560 --> 38:43.520
-And then we, uh--
-And you sell it at 7.50.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.880
-[Ewen] Yeah.
-Here.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.400
Actually, you normally sell it
at 6.50, don't you?

38:46.440 --> 38:47.840
-[Ewen] In the trailer, yeah.
-Right.

38:47.880 --> 38:49.600
-Yeah.
-No, that's good.
That's a good margin, yeah.

38:49.640 --> 38:52.600
[narrator]
Scott and David will need
more convincing tomorrow

38:52.640 --> 38:55.520
if they are to even think
about an offer.

38:55.560 --> 38:59.440
[David] I always like
to invest in things
that I actually like to eat.

38:59.480 --> 39:04.160
The issue is, he's actually got
quite a successful operation
doing what he's doing.

39:04.200 --> 39:05.520
And I don't really--

39:05.560 --> 39:06.960
If he's got
a successful operation,

39:07.000 --> 39:10.880
why should I tell him
to unspice his calamari?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.160
In various... All the companies
I've got,

39:13.200 --> 39:16.040
I've got co-shareholders who
will be saying to me,
on my shoulder,

39:16.080 --> 39:18.000
"Hang on, you had... You didn't
enjoy the first meal,

39:18.040 --> 39:20.520
why did you even go back
for a second round?"

39:20.560 --> 39:24.360
And I would say, well,
you know, one meal...
One shot is not enough.

39:24.400 --> 39:26.720
You've got to give
somebody two shots.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.560
Shit, not everyone's
gonna like your food.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.680
-See you tomorrow.
-Thank you very much.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.200
Yeah, yeah. yeah.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.040
I've said, you know,
I'll tweak
a few things for tomorrow,

39:35.080 --> 39:37.040
'cause that's all they are,
little, little things

39:37.080 --> 39:38.640
that just need
a bit of changing.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.600
And he might be
blown away tomorrow.

39:40.640 --> 39:42.600
Fucking hell. It's not over.
[chuckles]

39:55.560 --> 39:59.600
[Fred] It's the third
and final day for the teams
behind Epoch and ShrimpWreck.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.600
Now, they have to prove
they can run a restaurant
for full-paying customers.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.720
The investors
are coming in for lunch,

40:05.760 --> 40:08.000
and they will sit
and watch their every move

40:08.040 --> 40:11.200
before deciding whether
to invest or not.

40:11.240 --> 40:14.880
For Epoch, it might well be
a fight to the death
between Lydia and Atul.

40:14.920 --> 40:17.320
However, they've
got to show their class.

40:17.360 --> 40:18.720
They've got to

40:18.760 --> 40:20.480
show that they can keep
their cool under pressure.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.000
-Hi, girls. How are you?
-[Emily] Hello.

40:25.040 --> 40:26.560
-Really good. How are you?
-[Fred] Yeah, very Good.
Thank you.

40:26.600 --> 40:28.520
So, how was your meeting
yesterday?

40:28.560 --> 40:31.120
-Very exciting.
-They really, really
loved our concepts.

40:31.160 --> 40:33.800
So, do you feel energized
after this meeting?

40:33.840 --> 40:36.760
Yeah, definitely.
I think it picked us
back up from Monday.

40:36.800 --> 40:38.840
Monday was hard,
and you had to lick
your wounds.

40:38.880 --> 40:40.160
-[Emily] Yeah.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.760
-But, today,
you're feeling good.
-[Emily] Yeah.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.000
Until about four o'clock today,
we have to give everything.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.520
There's a plan B
for everything.

40:46.560 --> 40:48.760
-If this happens, then
we need to do this, so...
-Right.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.680
It's gotta be running
like a Swiss watch.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.280
-[mimics watch ticking]
-[Emily chuckles]

40:53.320 --> 40:55.160
Very good, very good.

40:55.200 --> 40:56.680
I mean, anyway,
the proof is in the pudding.
We have to see the service.

40:56.720 --> 40:57.840
-Good luck.
-[Emily] Thank you.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.240
This service could, like,
change our lives, you know.

41:04.280 --> 41:07.240
If we have an amazing service,
and everything goes smoothly
and well,

41:07.280 --> 41:08.960
there's a potential
that they are gonna offer.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.760
And if not, then we're back
to the drawing board.

41:12.840 --> 41:14.320
Hi, everyone.

41:14.360 --> 41:15.880
Hi.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.360
Can I just have
a quick word with you?
Let's just go stand

41:18.960 --> 41:19.880
over here.

41:20.520 --> 41:21.920
Just to let you know,

41:21.960 --> 41:25.080
-a lot does depend on today.
-Yeah.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.400
You guys have to be the ones
that are running the show
on a day-to-day basis,

41:28.440 --> 41:30.200
and so I have to feel
that you're capable of that.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.320
And, obviously, I know
you have great experience,

41:32.360 --> 41:35.560
-but you both are really young,
so that is a concern for me.
-Mmm-hmm. Yep.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.000
[Lydia] I am really
nervous for them.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.440
I haven't slept a bit
all night, actually.

41:38.480 --> 41:41.640
I would love to bring them in,
but I genuinely cannot,

41:41.680 --> 41:44.720
unless they can manage
their operations

41:44.760 --> 41:47.440
to a five star
luxury hotel standard.

41:47.480 --> 41:50.120
Like, literally,
that's put on pressure
too much now.

41:50.160 --> 41:53.800
We've quit our jobs.
We've, literally, left
everything for this.

41:53.840 --> 41:58.240
We have five hours
to completely impress them.

41:58.280 --> 42:02.320
I love you all
and I wish us all the best.

42:02.760 --> 42:03.680
Okay.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.040
-Mmm.
-Okay.

42:07.760 --> 42:09.280
-[Fred] How are you, Ewen?
-I'm very good.

42:09.320 --> 42:10.680
So, how did it go yesterday?

42:10.720 --> 42:13.440
It was an emotional day,
like, up and down.

42:13.480 --> 42:17.680
But, today, we've put
much more time into
the mix of the squid,

42:17.720 --> 42:19.480
and they just said
it was a bit too overpowering.

42:19.520 --> 42:21.200
What do you mean,
in terms of the spices or--

42:21.240 --> 42:22.640
In terms of
the spice and the salt.

42:22.680 --> 42:24.480
In Glasgow, they like it hot.

42:24.520 --> 42:27.240
Apparently.
I'm more than happy
to change it.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.640
And if it helps anything,
then, yeah,
we'll just run with it.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.360
It's a good attitude to have.

42:31.400 --> 42:35.480
Whatever I take away from this,
it's only going to
come out positive,

42:35.520 --> 42:36.960
so I'm looking forward
to the service.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.720
Well, you deserve
to succeed, Ewen.
Good luck for today.

42:38.760 --> 42:39.640
-Cheers.
-Take care.

42:39.680 --> 42:40.640
See you in a bit.

42:47.720 --> 42:49.600
-Everything's ready over here?
-Yeah.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.160
[narrator] Today, they open
for lunch to the public.

42:52.200 --> 42:53.720
-Welcome to Epoch.
-[woman] Thank you.

42:53.760 --> 42:55.800
Do the water first.
Put the water on the table.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.960
[narrator] And the investors
will want to see if they can
handle a restaurant

42:59.000 --> 43:00.840
full of paying customers.

43:00.880 --> 43:03.360
-You need to get the cutlery
down now, straightaway.
-[Ron] Yeah.

43:03.400 --> 43:05.720
[Emily] Because... Look,
they're doing the dishes now.
It's almost created.

43:05.760 --> 43:08.600
So, there's a shrimp bun
with no bacon, that's this one.

43:08.640 --> 43:11.440
[narrator] At ShrimpWreck,
Ewen's hoping the investors
will see

43:11.480 --> 43:13.240
how much the public
love his food.

43:15.120 --> 43:16.960
When you get in bed
with an operator,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.560
you've got to make sure
that the food offer stays
the same or improves.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.160
I'm hoping the food
will be better this time.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.720
[Emily] Hello.
Very good afternoon.
How are you doing?

43:24.760 --> 43:26.480
[narrator] After their
chaotic soft launch,

43:26.520 --> 43:30.720
Epoch are about to charge
£60 a head for lunch.

43:30.760 --> 43:36.200
Atul and Lydia will expect
to see a first-class operation
to match those prices.

43:36.240 --> 43:37.800
[Atul] I want to
see the service.

43:37.840 --> 43:40.400
I want to see how they will
perform under stress.

43:40.440 --> 43:42.480
Needs to be faultless.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.480
[Lydia] I really want to see
an efficient service.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.000
This is a lot of pressure,

43:46.040 --> 43:47.880
but every day in service
is going to be
a lot of pressure.

43:50.200 --> 43:51.480
Hi. Good afternoon.

43:51.520 --> 43:53.480
-[man] Can I grab your coat?
-Yes, please.

43:53.520 --> 43:54.880
-Hello.
-Thank you.

43:54.920 --> 43:57.200
-If you'd like to follow me.
-[Lydia] Thank you.

43:57.240 --> 44:00.120
So you've got
roasted baby beetroot,
a beetroot puree.

44:00.160 --> 44:02.560
The discs here
are pickled beetroot
and then beetroot crisps.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.480
-On table five--
-Yeah.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.960
Still water
and two glasses
of sparkling wine.

44:11.720 --> 44:14.680
[Lydia] Things look,
more or less, under control.
[Atul] Mmm.

44:16.760 --> 44:19.600
Is that everything, guys?
And what about drinks?
Do you want drinks?

44:19.640 --> 44:21.880
[narrator] Shrimpwreck
is fully booked today,

44:21.920 --> 44:24.560
with 50 covers
due through the door.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.760
It's very, very nice.
It tastes fresh.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.720
We've got their
sharing platter.

44:28.760 --> 44:30.520
We just wanted a bit
of everything.

44:30.560 --> 44:31.840
Yeah, it's really tasty.

44:31.880 --> 44:34.560
[Ewen] So they've ordered
buffalo prawns.

44:34.600 --> 44:37.800
Let's see if they like
the sort of tweak
we've done on that

44:37.840 --> 44:39.200
to lower the heat.

44:39.240 --> 44:42.560
And we've got
ShrimpWreck chowder
and a shrimp bun,

44:42.600 --> 44:44.360
and some of the squid to start.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.400
Right, I'm gonna go
to the agitator.

44:50.800 --> 44:53.440
That looks
completely different from
what I just...

44:54.440 --> 44:55.560
Much better.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.360
He's tempered the heat
and put less on.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.960
-It's good. That's nice.
He listened.
-Mmm-hmm.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.520
Once again,
the actual ingredient,

45:04.560 --> 45:05.920
the base ingredient
is fantastic.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.680
-It's so fresh.
-Yeah, it's good.

45:07.720 --> 45:10.640
Comments card on the table.
You vet that,
see what they say?

45:13.040 --> 45:15.080
"Go easy on the salt."

45:15.120 --> 45:17.280
Quality of service,
friendliness of staff,
speed of service,

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
appearance of staff
and value for money
was all very good.

45:20.520 --> 45:22.360
[Emily] Can I get
table nine away?

45:22.400 --> 45:23.800
-Yeah, we're going now.
-Yeah.

45:23.840 --> 45:26.280
One lamb, one turnip, mate,
you've got cutlery down.

45:26.320 --> 45:29.400
[narrator] At Epoch,
lunch is about to be served.

45:29.440 --> 45:30.760
I just need you
floating around,

45:30.800 --> 45:33.120
topping up water,
asking if there's
empty dishes,

45:33.160 --> 45:34.560
-taking them.
-I'll do orders now.

45:34.600 --> 45:36.560
[Ruth] Check we have cutlery.
I need cutlery everywhere.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.280
-[Ruth] Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

45:43.840 --> 45:46.680
So, we've got some
Smith's Smokery eel,

45:46.720 --> 45:49.600
roasted baby beetroots,
beetroot puree.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.760
And you've got some
horseradish mayonnaise as well.

45:51.800 --> 45:53.920
-That's beautiful, thank you.
-Beautiful.

45:53.960 --> 45:55.960
-We need some cutlery.
-You need some?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.160
-Cutlery.
-That would be helpful.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.800
Yeah. No cutlery here.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.720
-Let's see how long it takes
someone to--
-Yeah, let's not say anything.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.640
-Maybe that's mean, but--
-No, well--

46:13.680 --> 46:16.120
-No-one's noticed yet.
-Absolutely.

46:16.160 --> 46:18.520
[Lydia] If I had
two potential investors

46:18.560 --> 46:20.120
who could make
such a difference,

46:20.160 --> 46:22.080
really give them
what they want,

46:22.120 --> 46:26.920
in my restaurant, I would be
watching them like a hawk.

46:29.680 --> 46:31.080
My view has always been that

46:31.120 --> 46:34.840
if we are sitting
and waiting,
it's not a good time.

46:36.640 --> 46:37.520
Thanks.

46:40.640 --> 46:41.560
Thank you.

46:42.200 --> 46:44.480
So far...

46:44.520 --> 46:47.560
Not luxury standards.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.600
[Joe] Emily, can I have
a quick word?

46:50.640 --> 46:53.520
Okay,
the investors' starters, they
were waiting for a while

46:53.560 --> 46:56.200
'cause nobody
gave them any cutlery.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.920
-Okay.
-It's okay, don't worry now,
everything's fine.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.800
-We just gotta keep
checking on them.
-No, no, no we're... Okay.

47:00.840 --> 47:02.240
You've got a lot stored on
them. Just gotta keep
your eye on the ball.

47:02.280 --> 47:03.520
Stop touching me,
stop touching me. Thank you.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.960
Can you just walk around
and help them, please.

47:06.000 --> 47:06.880
Absolutely.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.320
[Emily] Thank you.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.080
Okay, Ron, what's happening
with the investors?

47:10.120 --> 47:12.560
-Are they having wine
in this course, or not?
-Yes.

47:12.600 --> 47:13.800
-They are?
-A taster, yeah.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.760
Can you do it
for me now, please?

47:16.280 --> 47:18.120
Thank you.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.680
Thank you.

47:20.720 --> 47:24.520
So the next dish we have
is the megrim sole.

47:24.560 --> 47:26.520
-Beautiful.
-This is something
we didn't have,

47:26.560 --> 47:28.440
so we're trying something
a bit different.

47:28.480 --> 47:29.880
So I'll bring
the meat plate round as well.

47:32.200 --> 47:34.480
-Does look nice,
I have to say.
-It does look great.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.080
Thank you.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.600
Thank you very much.

47:42.520 --> 47:43.640
Thank you.

47:44.840 --> 47:46.120
Thank you very much.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.480
-Sorry.
-My fault.

47:48.520 --> 47:51.200
No, no, no, no.
My fault entirely.

47:51.240 --> 47:52.600
[Lydia] Well, it is
and isn't your fault.

47:52.640 --> 47:55.280
Should have had a tray.
Should have...

47:55.320 --> 47:57.560
-Anyway, not slick. Not slick.
-All right, go for it.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.880
The food came out
pretty quickly,

47:59.920 --> 48:01.640
and everyone was very happy
with the quality.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.480
Nothing slipped there.

48:03.520 --> 48:06.960
The service in the restaurant
was a little bit shoddy.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.280
The fact that Emily and Ruth
were both so involved
in the service

48:10.320 --> 48:13.520
means that there is no-one
casting a beady eye

48:13.560 --> 48:14.840
over all of the operations.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.760
[waitress] Hey, guys,
who is having chowder?

48:18.800 --> 48:22.600
-We are sharing.
-Sharing, right. I'll grab
extra side plates, then.

48:22.640 --> 48:25.480
-Enjoy. Thank you.
-[David] Thank you.

48:25.520 --> 48:30.080
I just think the whole thing
is over-extended, probably
because he wants to do this.

48:30.120 --> 48:31.560
-Is that more of it?
-That's really good, yeah.

48:36.320 --> 48:40.160
You see,
I'm much more interested
in the actual, basic product.

48:40.200 --> 48:42.280
The basic product
is absolutely amazing.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.120
And it's all the other stuff
on top of it.

48:44.160 --> 48:47.160
Sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

48:47.200 --> 48:51.080
The ingredient
quality is brilliant,
the bun is brilliant.

48:51.120 --> 48:53.600
And, almost, he shouldn't do
anything other than that.

48:53.640 --> 48:55.200
'cause it's absolutely
fantastic.

48:55.240 --> 48:58.880
I think that he's extended his
menu to appeal to a restaurant,

48:58.920 --> 49:00.480
and I don't think
it's worked very well.

49:00.520 --> 49:02.440
I'm still relatively undecided.

49:02.480 --> 49:04.840
At the moment, I can't...
You know, I can't give
a verdict.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.480
[Scott] And with all
the best ideas in the world,

49:06.520 --> 49:08.560
there's still no guarantee
it will work.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.520
But this...
It's more than a germ

49:10.560 --> 49:11.960
of an idea.
It's a good start.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.360
Cheers. Thank you.

49:13.400 --> 49:17.520
As per
financially investing,
I'm still thinking.

49:17.560 --> 49:21.720
[narrator] Lunch is over,
now the pressure
is on the investors.

49:21.760 --> 49:25.720
They have to decide
whether the idea is worth
their money.

49:25.760 --> 49:26.960
I'm a bit conflicted,

49:27.000 --> 49:28.400
and, now,
I have to go away and...

49:30.480 --> 49:32.480
...really think hard.

49:32.520 --> 49:34.240
-Thank you so much
for the lovely meal.
-Thank you so much.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.240
-And the service, thank you.
-Thank you so much.

49:36.280 --> 49:38.720
The lunch at Epoch was great.

49:38.760 --> 49:41.480
It's not without
teething trouble, to be honest.

49:41.520 --> 49:45.120
Uh, the food was amazing,
service...

49:45.160 --> 49:46.960
a bit all over the place,
in my opinion.

49:47.000 --> 49:51.320
And at this stage,
while it's not a deal-breaker,
it's very important.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.840
I want to go away
and think about it.

49:53.880 --> 49:55.600
I am not too sure
at the moment

49:55.640 --> 49:57.040
till the time I have done
my own maths.

50:04.680 --> 50:08.400
-How was service?
-It was good, yeah. Smooth.

50:08.440 --> 50:11.160
-Look, well, that's it.
It's the end of the three days.
-Yeah.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.080
You came in for one thing,
and one thing only,

50:13.120 --> 50:15.160
-securing an investment.
-Yep.

50:15.200 --> 50:17.360
-But now, it's up to them.
The pressure is on them.
-Mmm-hmm.

50:17.400 --> 50:18.880
-I've given them a deadline.
-Yeah.

50:18.920 --> 50:21.640
-So I've given them an hour
on the clock.
-Yeah.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.960
In one hour, hopefully,
they will come back
through that door,

50:25.000 --> 50:26.200
and make you an offer.

50:26.240 --> 50:29.200
You know, I've done
what I could have.

50:29.240 --> 50:30.640
We'll just have to wait
and see now.

50:47.840 --> 50:51.240
[narrator] Ewen came here
looking for £100,000.

50:51.280 --> 50:55.600
If David or Scott don't return
with an offer of investment
by 6:30,

50:55.640 --> 50:57.240
he'll walk away with nothing.

51:11.560 --> 51:12.720
How do you feel?

51:13.760 --> 51:14.960
[stammers] Nervous.

51:16.680 --> 51:19.640
This hour is... [chuckles]
Is really dragging.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.440
Dragging on.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.080
It's a crazy feeling.

51:27.920 --> 51:29.800
It's like it's just been...

51:29.840 --> 51:31.960
It's been like a little bubble,
the last few days.

51:32.000 --> 51:33.760
Yeah.

51:33.800 --> 51:37.160
Just with, potentially,
such a massive outcome.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.640
[sighs heavily]

52:07.040 --> 52:07.880
Ewen...

52:09.440 --> 52:10.320
I'm sorry, but...

52:12.480 --> 52:15.560
-I don't think they're coming.
-Mmm. Doesn't look like it.

52:17.480 --> 52:18.320
No.

52:25.440 --> 52:26.680
Tried my best, eh?

52:32.040 --> 52:33.680
Obviously, a bit disappointed.

52:35.000 --> 52:39.800
but, you know, it is
what it is, and... [chuckles]

52:39.840 --> 52:42.840
I'll still... [stammers]
I'll make it happen.

52:44.280 --> 52:46.560
Keep working towards it.
I'll make it happen.

52:49.560 --> 52:53.120
[David] What he's done,
is taken a very good
street van operation,

52:53.160 --> 52:57.120
and the advancement
to restaurant level
hasn't really worked.

52:57.160 --> 52:59.640
Plus, the fact
my first impression was...

52:59.680 --> 53:01.960
My first bite was poor.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.920
It was a poor impression.

53:03.960 --> 53:06.640
And it never really
recovered from that.

53:06.680 --> 53:10.720
If, maybe, my first bite
had been brilliant,
I'd chose another dish,

53:10.760 --> 53:12.400
it might have affected
my whole outlook.

53:12.440 --> 53:13.880
[narrator] He won't
commit money,

53:13.920 --> 53:17.320
but Scott does have ideas
to help Ewen grow.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.960
I'm not ready to invest
in Ewen right now,

53:20.000 --> 53:23.600
but further down the line
there's definite potential.

53:23.640 --> 53:27.840
Meanwhile, I'm gonna, I think,
get him more experience.

53:27.880 --> 53:30.320
see him inside various
different kitchens,

53:30.360 --> 53:32.120
which I'm happy
to help with.

53:32.160 --> 53:35.040
It's gonna help him
broaden his horizons.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.800
And then, in three
to six months, who knows,

53:37.840 --> 53:40.400
then there may be
an investment forthcoming.

53:47.320 --> 53:53.320
[narrator] It's half-past 7:00,
and now, it's Emily
and Ruth who have to wait.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.440
Atul and Lydia have a deadline
of eight o'clock
to walk through the door,

53:57.480 --> 53:59.200
and make
their investment offer.

54:00.680 --> 54:02.200
If they both come back,

54:02.240 --> 54:03.960
Ruth and Emily
will have to choose

54:04.000 --> 54:05.840
between competing investors.

54:14.840 --> 54:16.560
[Emily] Tummy
is, like, turning.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.640
-What about you?
-Yeah, same.

54:20.680 --> 54:21.840
Yeah?

54:24.600 --> 54:25.640
[sighs]

54:29.640 --> 54:31.120
[Emily] I'm so nervous.
[Fred] Are you?

54:31.160 --> 54:32.120
[Emily] Yeah.

54:33.120 --> 54:34.600
Are you, Ruth?

54:34.640 --> 54:36.840
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just a little bit tense.

54:38.320 --> 54:41.760
I mean, you've done...
You've done incredibly well.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.840
I mean, these three days
has been a roller coaster,
haven't they?

54:44.880 --> 54:48.400
Yeah, definitely.
There's been lots
of ups and downs.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.160
But to come this far,
you know what I mean,

54:51.200 --> 54:52.520
it's a bit like
climbing Everest.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.040
And you're 20.

54:55.080 --> 54:56.400
Not many people would do that.

54:57.480 --> 54:59.640
It's remarkable.

54:59.680 --> 55:01.600
I would have never done that
when I was your age.

55:01.640 --> 55:02.680
I wouldn't have done it.

55:04.880 --> 55:08.280
-Is your heart vibrating?
-Okay, hold my hand.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.920
Just don't squeeze it
too tight.

55:09.960 --> 55:10.800
[Emily] Sorry.

55:40.240 --> 55:41.880
Atul. Hello.

55:43.280 --> 55:44.800
-Were you getting worried?
-[Fred] Yes.

55:44.840 --> 55:47.160
Just a little bit.
We'd like to clarify.

55:47.720 --> 55:49.120
Good to see you.

55:49.160 --> 55:50.840
Hello, ladies, how are you?

55:50.880 --> 55:51.800
[Emily] Good.
[Ruth] A lot better now.

55:51.840 --> 55:53.400
Yeah. [laughs]

55:53.440 --> 55:55.560
-Good to see you.
-Great to see you.

55:59.280 --> 56:02.360
Well, I think that we have to
wait a couple of seconds

56:02.400 --> 56:03.800
-'cause Lydia could
still come in.
-Okay.

56:03.840 --> 56:05.480
And I think it's only fair.

56:05.520 --> 56:07.160
It's absolutely fair.

56:07.200 --> 56:11.200
I better put my jacket
on my chair,
just in case she does.

56:26.600 --> 56:29.040
[Lydia] It was
a really close call for me.

56:29.080 --> 56:32.600
What worried me,
at the end of the day,

56:32.640 --> 56:35.840
was the quality
of the service
in front of house.

56:35.880 --> 56:40.920
I just couldn't risk
doing something
that was less than 100%.

56:42.760 --> 56:45.240
-[Fred] So you came here--
-Yes.

56:45.280 --> 56:46.440
[Fred] You must have an offer.

56:47.520 --> 56:49.080
-I do.
-Let's hear it.

56:50.440 --> 56:53.680
Let me say that it's been
an amazing experience

56:53.720 --> 56:56.760
to get to know
both of you,
over two meals.

56:56.800 --> 56:59.000
It was really impressive.

56:59.040 --> 57:02.200
All that puts a massive smile
on my face.

57:02.240 --> 57:05.400
It will be a joy
to be able to work with you.

57:07.840 --> 57:10.120
So, I'm happy
to make you an offer.

57:14.920 --> 57:16.080
I'm happy to invest

57:17.680 --> 57:22.200
anything between £750,000
to a million pound.

57:22.240 --> 57:24.440
But it will be
a lot of hard work, girls.

57:24.480 --> 57:26.400
-Sorry.
-[Atul] It's okay.

57:34.320 --> 57:36.040
[Atul] Don't make me cry, okay?

57:36.080 --> 57:38.480
-That wouldn't be good.
-[Emily] This one never
has emotions.

57:40.080 --> 57:42.600
But, yeah, this is,
like, so surreal.

57:42.640 --> 57:43.520
Thank you so much.

57:44.200 --> 57:46.200
You're very welcome.

57:46.240 --> 57:48.560
I don't even think
I can explain how I am
feeling right now.

57:48.600 --> 57:51.240
I, literally, am, like,
so lost for words.

57:51.280 --> 57:53.160
Thank you so much
for believing in us.

57:53.200 --> 57:56.280
I'm happy that you're happy
to be my partner.

57:56.320 --> 57:58.400
It's a big moment
for me, too.

57:58.440 --> 58:00.440
I just don't want to cry,
that's all.

58:00.480 --> 58:01.840
Don't make me cry.
I look horrible.

58:01.880 --> 58:04.680
Come here, come here.
Let me give you a hug.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.160
I'm feeling very happy,
to be honest.

58:06.200 --> 58:08.560
I really wanted to work
with these two young ladies.

58:09.520 --> 58:11.440
[Fred] Oh!

58:11.480 --> 58:15.360
My ethos has always been
supporting new people
coming into the industry,

58:15.400 --> 58:18.320
and giving them
all the right things
that they can have,

58:18.360 --> 58:20.000
to be honest.

58:20.040 --> 58:23.520
I've got a strong feeling
that this pair will be
the shining light

58:23.560 --> 58:24.960
for a very long time to come.

58:25.000 --> 58:26.920
[all] Cheers!

58:26.960 --> 58:28.840
[Fred] Well done.
To your future, girls.

58:28.880 --> 58:30.200
-To your future.
-Thank you.

58:31.360 --> 58:34.320
Amazing. Unheard of.
One million pound!

58:34.360 --> 58:36.160
One million pound!

58:36.200 --> 58:38.400
Can you believe it!
Just goes to show,

58:38.440 --> 58:41.120
in this industry,
doesn't matter
how young you are,

58:41.160 --> 58:43.880
if you put your mind to it,
you can do it.

58:47.680 --> 58:49.080
So, who's the boss?

58:49.120 --> 58:51.640
Um, I guess we all take
control of our different areas.

58:51.680 --> 58:55.400
-It might sound a bit of a--
-Cop out?

58:55.440 --> 58:57.080
Do you know what's happening
with all these people?

58:57.120 --> 58:58.560
-Are they all waiting?
-Yeah, they're all waiting.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.920
Oh, shit, the, uh,
fries are off.

59:00.960 --> 59:03.000
We are running
a little bit behind.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.160
-Don't cry.
-No, I'm not.

59:04.200 --> 59:05.080
No.
