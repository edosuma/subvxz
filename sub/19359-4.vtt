00:18.166 --> 00:19.250
HANNAH: Ray has no idea,
and thinks he's just

00:19.250 --> 00:20.500
in a regular, in love couple.

00:20.500 --> 00:22.708
By the way, me telling you this
does not make me

00:22.708 --> 00:25.417
a bad secret-keeper.
I'm a great secret-keeper.

00:25.417 --> 00:26.250
No, you're not.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.583
For me, I was just fixated.

00:28.583 --> 00:31.583
Your best friend,
and then your boyfriend...

00:31.834 --> 00:33.500
How do you even recover
from that?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.959
You'd probably have fun
at surf camp

00:34.959 --> 00:36.208
if you just let yourself.

00:36.542 --> 00:37.625
Maybe I don't want to enjoy
things all the time.

00:37.625 --> 00:38.875
Maybe that's not my style.

00:39.208 --> 00:41.417
-Desi, what are these?
-They're oxy.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.542
And I've been on them
for a fucking year!

00:43.792 --> 00:45.291
-Put 'em back!
-No!

00:45.792 --> 00:46.625
(GLASS SHATTERS)

00:46.875 --> 00:48.291
Why would a smart woman like you

00:48.291 --> 00:50.291
write a very long,
and considered piece of writing,

00:50.291 --> 00:51.834
on what is ultimately hearsay?

00:51.834 --> 00:53.125
I don't consider the accounts

00:53.125 --> 00:54.542
of four different women
"hearsay."

00:54.542 --> 00:56.125
Would you lie down with me
for a moment?

00:56.458 --> 00:57.333
(BOOKS THUDS)

01:04.959 --> 01:07.291
Woman:
Is green tea all right
for you, Hillary?

01:07.291 --> 01:08.792
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.959
Um, so, when I finally
got to New York

01:10.959 --> 01:13.375
and I knew that I wanted
to support myself

01:13.375 --> 01:15.458
on my own
so I could write,

01:15.458 --> 01:18.125
well, I thought that
was gonna mean, you know,

01:18.125 --> 01:22.375
serving cheesecake in Junior's
or temping in the Bronx.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.750
And it turned out

01:23.750 --> 01:26.500
it meant
part-time sex work

01:26.500 --> 01:29.250
in an oddly clinical
townhouse in midtown.

01:29.250 --> 01:31.834
And you know something?

01:33.166 --> 01:35.417
That was the happiest
I've ever been.

01:35.417 --> 01:38.542
But I don't understand
because you came to New York
because you wanted to write,

01:38.542 --> 01:41.291
so I don't really get,
like, how, like, servicing
other people

01:41.291 --> 01:43.000
would give you
what you wanted.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.458
Yes, but that's the mistake
we all make, isn't it?

01:46.458 --> 01:49.583
Believing that
being a writer means
being, you know,

01:49.583 --> 01:52.291
totally and utterly
uninterrupted.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.667
It means silence.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.834
It means, you know,
a room of one's own.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.375
No, no, no.
See, that's bullshit.

01:58.375 --> 02:02.500
Bullshit.
That's what we perceive
a male writer to have.

02:02.500 --> 02:03.959
- You know?
- ( cat yowls )

02:03.959 --> 02:06.959
And that can lead
to, ugh, horrible solipsism

02:06.959 --> 02:09.250
and disconnection
from humanity.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.458
I'm not naming names.

02:10.458 --> 02:12.625
Never naming names.

02:12.625 --> 02:14.125
Martin fucking Amis,

02:14.125 --> 02:16.291
Woody Allen,
Saul Bellow.

02:16.291 --> 02:19.542
If you give the men
the space that they
say they need,

02:19.542 --> 02:21.500
then their work suffers,
they suffer.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.708
I guess that surprises me
because I've always thought

02:23.708 --> 02:25.291
that I was working
towards this moment

02:25.291 --> 02:26.708
when everything else
would fall away

02:26.708 --> 02:28.166
and I would just be,
like, you know, alone

02:28.166 --> 02:30.375
and able to just
indulge my thoughts.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.834
No, but that's bullshit.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.834
I mean, can you even
picture that?

02:33.834 --> 02:35.583
Can you picture that?

02:35.583 --> 02:38.208
I am not a mother,

02:38.208 --> 02:39.708
and there's
a reason for that.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.875
Because childlessness
is the natural state

02:42.875 --> 02:44.708
of the female author,
okay?

02:44.708 --> 02:47.708
Write that down.
Get used to it, you know?

02:47.708 --> 02:49.250
And, you know, I hate it
when everyone says,

02:49.250 --> 02:50.625
"Having a baby makes you
part of the world."

02:50.625 --> 02:52.208
I really resent that.

02:52.208 --> 02:54.875
I don't need one of those
to be able to look around.

02:54.875 --> 02:59.542
You know? I don't-- it's like
having a truck driven through
your vagina, isn't it?

02:59.542 --> 03:01.917
Totally.
So, then I'll just
put it out there--

03:01.917 --> 03:06.083
is being a writer
and being a woman
at the same time,

03:06.083 --> 03:08.834
is it as hard
as it seems or...?

03:08.834 --> 03:10.750
Harder.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.542
( music playing )

03:26.750 --> 03:28.083
I'm not scared.

03:30.291 --> 03:32.959
As long as I can
keep my mother alive,
I'm not scared.

03:34.291 --> 03:37.500
You mean tell me mission
does not scare you?

03:49.458 --> 03:52.250
What scares me is
losing the woman
who raised me.

03:53.708 --> 03:56.458
What scares me
is the cancer

03:56.458 --> 03:59.834
taking over her whole body
and, finally, her head...

04:01.375 --> 04:04.291
robbing her of oxygen
and of the will to live.

04:05.792 --> 04:07.667
What scares me
is this world.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.125
- No, I'm not scared.
- Woman: Cut!

04:13.125 --> 04:15.708
- Jesus fucking...
- Cut, please, now!

04:17.666 --> 04:18.959
Take break, Jadviga.

04:20.666 --> 04:23.959
- What?
- Still, I feel there's
no emotions from you,

04:23.959 --> 04:25.458
this feeling
of big nothing,

04:25.458 --> 04:27.250
which, for me,
is not okay.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.834
I still don't understand
why he's talking so much
right now.

04:29.834 --> 04:31.834
He is fucking scared.

04:31.834 --> 04:34.792
And-- and he's been so private
about his mother's illness
up until now.

04:34.792 --> 04:38.500
So, what is it about now
that makes him all of a sudden
wanna go on and on and on--

04:38.500 --> 04:41.333
- These are lines to explain!
- Yes, I know. I know.

04:41.333 --> 04:44.125
I just think
I could do a better job
if I don't say the lines.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.041
So, which lines
would you say, hmm?

04:46.041 --> 04:47.583
No lines.

04:47.583 --> 04:48.917
No lines?

04:48.917 --> 04:51.667
With no lines, no story!
Just... ( blows raspberry )

04:51.667 --> 04:55.500
I-- I want lines sometimes,
Director Olatta.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.083
Other times, I don't.
It just depends.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.875
Adam,
you're very talented,

04:59.875 --> 05:01.583
but I cannot keep
with the debating you!

05:01.583 --> 05:02.959
It gets me
so frustrate!

05:02.959 --> 05:05.125
I'm also
very frustrate, okay?!

05:05.125 --> 05:07.583
I think we both want
the same thing.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.542
We wanna make the best movie
we possibly can

05:09.542 --> 05:11.125
- in the shortest
amount of time.
- ( speaking foreign language )

05:11.125 --> 05:13.792
I'm saying we're limited,
unfortunately.

05:13.792 --> 05:15.250
Yesterday,
I'm completely here and--

05:15.250 --> 05:17.917
this is so fucking rude
to talk about someone and...

05:17.917 --> 05:20.542
- Fuck this!
- ( argument continues )

05:20.542 --> 05:22.250
Uh, good-bye.
It was nice meeting you.

05:22.250 --> 05:24.625
- What?
- Best of luck with
your son's graduation.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.542
I'm fucking leaving!

05:26.542 --> 05:29.458
- "Wh-what? What?"
- ( door closes )

05:29.458 --> 05:32.333
This thing
is itchy as fuck!

05:32.333 --> 05:34.834
( moans )
Oh, you're so hot.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.708
- I wanna come.
- Fuck me. Yes, please come.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.333
And then I'll come
with your cum in my body.

05:39.333 --> 05:41.125
- Okay, great.
- ( moans )

05:41.125 --> 05:42.542
- I want a countdown.
- Yeah.

05:42.542 --> 05:45.708
Five, four,
three, two--

05:45.708 --> 05:47.417
- ( grunts )
- You came early.

05:47.417 --> 05:49.250
Hold on.
Almost there.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.625
( moaning )

05:55.500 --> 05:56.417
( sighs )

05:58.291 --> 06:02.500
I wanna die
inside the mouth
of a lion with you.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.417
And that way,
we can be together forever,

06:05.417 --> 06:07.917
even in the moment
of our own death.

06:07.917 --> 06:11.917
Your death
and my death, right?

06:11.917 --> 06:13.375
Hello?

06:13.375 --> 06:14.750
Huh?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.291
Yeah.

06:19.208 --> 06:22.041
- What?
- I would literally die
for someone to say that to me.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.792
That's, like,
fucking poetry.

06:23.792 --> 06:25.625
It's, like,
Shakespeare.

06:25.625 --> 06:26.959
Yeah, no, it is poetry.

06:26.959 --> 06:28.625
It's beautiful
and flattering.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.792
- Good.
- Yeah.

06:30.959 --> 06:32.792
But couldn't we just,
like, um...

06:33.917 --> 06:35.959
just get dinner
sometimes?

06:35.959 --> 06:38.000
- Yeah.
- I feel like I haven't
seen you in weeks.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.458
You're always at rehearsal
or booty body camp,
whatever it is.

06:41.458 --> 06:45.458
Ray, it's not my fault
if I wanna get strong
for myself.

06:45.458 --> 06:46.834
Yeah, no, I know.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.333
And that's great.
That's good.

06:48.333 --> 06:51.458
And you are strong.
It's just...
( sighs )

06:51.458 --> 06:53.625
I don't know.
Look, I wanna be in
the lion's mouth with you.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.041
- That sounds nice.
- Good.

06:55.041 --> 06:58.083
It sounds cozy and warm
and exciting and dangerous.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.667
But I also,
I don't know--

06:59.667 --> 07:01.166
don't you just wanna,
like, get dumplings

07:01.166 --> 07:02.750
and throw down a few beers
and just catch up?

07:02.750 --> 07:04.333
See what you've
been up to and stuff?

07:04.333 --> 07:06.417
Yeah, obviously
that would be great.

07:06.417 --> 07:09.625
That's, like,
if you asked me like,
"What's your ideal plan?"

07:09.625 --> 07:11.000
That's my ideal plan.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.333
Well, let's do it.
Let's do it tonight.

07:13.333 --> 07:16.166
Oh, no, I can't tonight.
I have a thing.
And don't ask.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.875
It's far too long
and boring a story
to explain what it is.

07:18.875 --> 07:21.458
But, actually,
that reminds me,

07:21.458 --> 07:23.834
it's gonna be
a total nightmare
getting uptown.

07:23.834 --> 07:28.542
Do you think if I Uber,
it will be made worth it

07:28.542 --> 07:31.583
if I'm able to meditate
and catch up on emails
in the car?

07:31.583 --> 07:34.834
Or should I try
to meditate on the train?

07:34.834 --> 07:36.959
I mean, last time I tried
to meditate on the train,

07:36.959 --> 07:38.458
some dude was
manspreading next to me.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.792
And it's just--
it's harder,

07:40.792 --> 07:43.375
but maybe that's a better
challenge to my ability
to remain mindful.

07:43.375 --> 07:46.375
- It's just such
a much steadier--
- Huh?

07:46.375 --> 07:47.708
Should I Uber?

07:49.375 --> 07:51.208
What?

07:51.208 --> 07:53.000
Uber. Yeah.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.208
You can take an Uber.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.333
Hot rod
in my urethra.

07:58.333 --> 07:59.875
Pipe cleaner.

07:59.875 --> 08:01.834
It feels like
a pipe cleaner's in there.

08:01.834 --> 08:04.041
( groans )

08:04.041 --> 08:06.208
Ow. Ugh!

08:06.208 --> 08:09.500
"Law & Order: UTI."
Gong-gong!

08:09.500 --> 08:12.500
It's not funny.
It feels so bad, okay?

08:12.500 --> 08:14.375
And I didn't even
get this one from sex.

08:14.375 --> 08:16.625
I just walked around
in wet underwear for
a couple of days.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.375
( chuckles )
You're gross.

08:18.375 --> 08:21.083
Hannah, can you text
that one interesting
lesbian you know

08:21.083 --> 08:23.291
and see if she can get me
into the "New York Mag"
party tonight?

08:23.291 --> 08:25.583
I don't know, Elijah.
My bladder's on fire.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.750
I don't know if
I feel like abusing my media
contacts for you right now.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.583
Jaden Pinkett Smith is
starting a greeting card line.

08:31.583 --> 08:34.958
Please!
You're gonna look cool
for even knowing about it.

08:34.958 --> 08:36.750
Can I at least have
some pain killers?

08:36.750 --> 08:41.332
Oh, I wish
you had asked me,
like, two hours ago.

08:41.332 --> 08:42.625
Clean out.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.708
Well, will you
tickle my back?

08:44.708 --> 08:45.583
No.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.750
You know how they're shutting
the N/R down at DeKalb?

08:50.750 --> 08:55.834
Reminds me of this time
back when I was assistant to
the transportation commissioner

08:55.834 --> 08:58.083
when-- and they
don't tell you this--

08:58.083 --> 08:59.583
they shut the B down,

08:59.583 --> 09:02.667
or let's just say
they pretended to
shut the B down,

09:02.667 --> 09:05.250
leaving it running
only for the mayor

09:05.250 --> 09:07.000
and his
homosexual friends.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.834
- Sorry.
- I think you can imagine

09:09.834 --> 09:11.291
who I might be
talking about.

09:11.291 --> 09:13.458
But if you can't,
picture this--

09:13.458 --> 09:15.959
a train
full of homosexuals,

09:15.959 --> 09:17.500
me--
I don't judge--

09:17.500 --> 09:18.792
riding in secret.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.458
Wow, that's
a crazy story.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.041
- Here you go.
- Oh, you can't imagine
what I saw.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.458
But my job was
just to be quiet...

09:25.458 --> 09:27.000
Sure, yeah,
just to be quiet.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.959
Here you go.
It was really nice
seeing you, Bobby.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.708
Thanks for coming in.
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

09:30.708 --> 09:32.291
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

09:34.625 --> 09:37.750
- Uh, hey, is that scone
raisin or Craisin?
- ( door opens )

09:37.750 --> 09:39.625
( sighs )
I don't know, man.

09:39.625 --> 09:40.667
- ( door closes )
- I don't know.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.750
( gasps, grunts )

09:43.750 --> 09:46.333
- Man: Hey. Hey, Bobby?
- Oh, Jesus.

09:48.625 --> 09:50.166
- ( door opens )
- Ray: Bobby!

09:50.166 --> 09:51.834
Woman:
Guys, someone call 911!

09:51.834 --> 09:53.834
- Bobby?
- ( door closes )

09:53.834 --> 09:55.333
Bobby?

09:55.333 --> 09:58.375
...and, Desi,
it is my personal opinion

09:58.375 --> 10:01.250
that we really need
to get back to work.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.417
More specifically,
you need to get back to work.

10:03.417 --> 10:05.208
And I think it would
be good for your health.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.500
Oh, for my health?
Okay.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.333
So, I should just bail
on my recovery?

10:08.333 --> 10:10.291
- Do you think that's
a good idea?
- No.

10:10.291 --> 10:12.834
Hey, nice doing
business with you.
It's been great.

10:12.834 --> 10:14.458
I mean, I don't wanna
play the blame game,

10:14.458 --> 10:16.291
but you're
my worst enabler.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.125
What you just did right there--
and I don't wanna insult you--

10:18.125 --> 10:19.792
but that was fucked up
what you just did
right there.

10:19.792 --> 10:21.333
- Okay.
- All right.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.333
It's not an insult.
Nobody's blaming you.

10:23.333 --> 10:27.417
Desi just feels
as if maybe you have
helped to support,

10:27.417 --> 10:29.458
- even encourage
his relapse.
- Yeah.

10:29.458 --> 10:31.333
Again, I'm not quite sure
how that isn't blaming me,

10:31.333 --> 10:33.750
but we can discuss--
you and I can discuss
that later.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.083
But I think that
the idea, Desi,

10:36.083 --> 10:37.792
that I have,
in some way,

10:37.792 --> 10:40.417
caused you to develop
an addiction to something

10:40.417 --> 10:42.792
is absurd.

10:42.792 --> 10:46.000
- No, that's--
no, it's not--
- Oh, my God!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.750
- It's not absurd.
- Oh, am I--

10:47.750 --> 10:49.125
you're hearing
what I'm hearing, right?

10:49.125 --> 10:50.834
- Because...
- It's okay, it's okay.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.250
We're going to
let Desi finish,
and when he's done,

10:53.250 --> 10:54.959
you can then let us know
how you feel.

10:54.959 --> 10:56.959
I promise you
I'll give you
tons of time.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.375
Okay, you finish now,
and then I'll have
my time to talk.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.750
I've been thinking--
( clears throat )

11:00.750 --> 11:02.375
I've been thinking...
( sighs )

11:03.667 --> 11:05.542
- Can I have some water?
- Yeah, have some water.

11:17.542 --> 11:19.458
- Take your time.
- Mm.

11:20.792 --> 11:24.750
( inhales, exhales )

11:29.125 --> 11:30.583
Jesus.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.417
Good. Good.

11:42.917 --> 11:44.333
As I was saying...

11:44.333 --> 11:45.792
( sniffs )

11:45.792 --> 11:48.333
...I've had a lot of time
to think about this.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.291
And I take
full responsibility
for where I'm at.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.125
That said,

11:54.125 --> 11:56.458
Marne, you were there
with me the whole time,
right next to me.

11:56.458 --> 11:59.208
You were my partner,
but you never saw me.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.667
You just saw
this dick...

12:02.083 --> 12:03.708
or this voice,
you know,

12:03.708 --> 12:06.625
or this guitar,
or this record contract.

12:06.625 --> 12:10.750
You had this idea about me,
but you never actually
saw me as a human.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.458
- Me, Desi.
- Raneed: Mm.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.125
And I fucking
loved you.

12:16.125 --> 12:19.125
It wasn't like your friends,
like little Hannah
and the gang,

12:19.125 --> 12:21.917
saying Marnie doesn't,
you know, care about
the environment,

12:21.917 --> 12:24.083
or Marnie's poetry
is repetitive,

12:24.083 --> 12:25.834
or rolling their eyes
and dismissing you,

12:25.834 --> 12:27.625
saying, "Oh, that's just
so Marnie, you know?"

12:27.625 --> 12:28.959
I fucking loved--

12:28.959 --> 12:30.542
I loved when things
were Marnie.

12:30.542 --> 12:33.834
- Mm.
- You know?
And I was all in.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.000
I just couldn't
handle me.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.667
And you
made that worse.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.750
You did, because
when I was struggling,

12:44.750 --> 12:48.000
you know,
you just shut down.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.625
I mean, you just
fucking walked away.

12:49.625 --> 12:50.750
You gave up.

12:50.750 --> 12:52.500
I shut down?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.458
I gave up?

12:54.458 --> 12:57.500
Do you have any idea
how hard this has
been for me?

12:57.500 --> 12:59.500
I have bruises
all over my body

12:59.500 --> 13:01.500
from the two-hour
massages that I need

13:01.500 --> 13:04.166
to deal with the stress
of your addiction.

13:07.291 --> 13:08.959
Are you--
are you serious?

13:08.959 --> 13:10.792
Yeah.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.667
- Did you hear
what she said, man?
- Yeah.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.750
Because you just made
my whole drug treatment
about you.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.000
You did.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.583
You really did,
Marnie.

13:18.583 --> 13:20.875
And it's clear
that your narcissism

13:20.875 --> 13:23.542
is detrimental
to Desi's recovery.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.417
Desi:
Can I just say
one more thing?

13:25.417 --> 13:27.458
Clean up your side
of the street,
Marnie Marie.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.208
Keep your side
of the street clean,
Marnie Marie.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.375
Woman in video:
Common traits exhibited
by children

13:32.375 --> 13:34.875
who go on to be diagnosed
as sociopaths

13:34.875 --> 13:38.166
- include displaying
a lack of empathy...
- Yep.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.291
- ...harming animals...
- Guilty.

13:40.291 --> 13:42.041
- ...setting fires...
- Yeah.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.667
- ...and petty vandalism.
- Oh, my God.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.917
I did so much
of this stuff.

13:47.208 --> 13:48.750
Adam...

13:48.750 --> 13:50.500
I think I may have been
a child sociopath.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.708
I mean, I've completely
outgrown it,

13:52.708 --> 13:55.083
but I'm a miracle.

13:55.083 --> 13:57.583
I think I may have to write
a term paper on me.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.458
I just quit
the fucking movie.

13:59.458 --> 14:02.083
Fuck!
The fuck did I do?

14:02.083 --> 14:05.250
I'm sure it's fine.
Can't you just go back
and apologize?

14:05.250 --> 14:07.959
These Eastern Europeans
are used to all this
coming and going.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.500
I can't fucking
do this anymore.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.083
Wait around
like some tool

14:11.083 --> 14:14.375
to be someone else's
fucking tool!

14:14.375 --> 14:16.083
This shit's
just so fucked!

14:16.083 --> 14:18.583
I'm just gonna tell my agent
to take me out of the game

14:18.583 --> 14:21.291
because I'm
so fucking pissed!

14:21.291 --> 14:23.166
Yeah,
I know, darling.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.417
I know.

14:24.417 --> 14:27.208
Do you get to keep
those jeans, though?

14:27.208 --> 14:28.917
I-I'm sorry?
You don't know.

14:28.917 --> 14:33.333
You can do your job
without a whole crew
of assholes in your face.

14:33.333 --> 14:36.625
You just have
one fucking psycho
to analyze.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.750
Like you?

14:37.750 --> 14:39.667
- Ha!
- ( chuckles )

14:39.667 --> 14:43.208
Adam, this is why
I'm saying you need
to make your own movie.

14:43.208 --> 14:46.208
- ( growling )
- You are an artist!

14:46.208 --> 14:49.458
I'm someone who knows
how to psychologically
support an artist.

14:49.458 --> 14:50.834
You can't just
make a movie, Jessa.

14:50.834 --> 14:53.041
You need funds
and sandwiches

14:53.041 --> 14:55.875
- and people who care
what you have...
- ( snores )

14:55.875 --> 14:58.333
I mean, honestly,
you're so boring.

14:58.333 --> 15:01.667
We can get that stuff.
We'll sort that out.

15:01.667 --> 15:04.458
Money literally
grows on trees.

15:04.458 --> 15:06.291
I mean, really,
let's look this up.

15:07.375 --> 15:12.625
"Making a movie."

15:14.125 --> 15:15.917
There's a lot.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.708
God damn,
that was stressful.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.500
Right in the middle
of a busy workday like that,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.875
just thwack,
down he goes.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.625
Yeah, wow.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.500
Jose said his head
smacked the ground
really hard.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.250
I feel bad.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.583
He was trying to tell me
this long, elaborate story
about Ed Koch,

15:32.583 --> 15:34.750
some secret gay train,
but I was working, you know?

15:34.750 --> 15:37.291
You can't-- you can't listen
to everyone at the same time

15:37.291 --> 15:39.458
or your fucking head
will explode, you know?

15:39.458 --> 15:42.333
Maybe it's about picking
who to listen to.

15:43.959 --> 15:45.375
What's that
supposed to mean?

15:47.792 --> 15:49.708
How long were you
on the community board?

15:49.708 --> 15:51.250
Three months?

15:51.250 --> 15:54.750
Then you quietly
retreated back to
dating girls with six packs

15:54.750 --> 15:56.875
and pretending death
wasn't real.

15:56.875 --> 15:59.834
I'm worried
about you, Ray.
You're smart.

15:59.834 --> 16:03.166
You've always been smart,
but your priorities are...

16:03.166 --> 16:04.542
cuckoo bananas.

16:04.542 --> 16:06.458
And what, you're some
fucking golden example?

16:06.458 --> 16:08.375
You hate your wife.
You hate your job.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.333
The only thing
that gives you a glimmer
of joy on this planet

16:10.333 --> 16:11.792
is recycling
soda cans.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.750
- It's free money!
- You know what, Herm?

16:13.750 --> 16:15.667
You're starting to
really fucking piss me off.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.875
You know that?
I work hard for you.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.625
I work hard
for this business,

16:19.625 --> 16:21.750
and you're gonna stand there
and call me a waste of space?

16:21.750 --> 16:24.041
Hmm? I don't need you
to judge me

16:24.041 --> 16:27.750
for not letting Bobby
gnash his dentures in
my fucking face.

16:27.750 --> 16:29.792
And who made you God,
by the way?

16:29.792 --> 16:31.959
I don't think
I'm God, Ray.

16:31.959 --> 16:34.792
Good, because
there is no God.

16:34.792 --> 16:37.250
That's a very
arrogant position, Ray.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.708
Congratulations.

16:38.708 --> 16:41.291
I've been with you
through all these phases--

16:41.291 --> 16:44.750
the music,
the failed sitcom script,

16:44.750 --> 16:47.750
the communism,
community board,

16:47.750 --> 16:50.708
and now
you're just coasting.

16:50.708 --> 16:51.792
And I'm probably
responsible.

16:51.792 --> 16:53.083
All right,
you know what, Hermie?

16:53.083 --> 16:54.667
It's been a brutal
fucking day.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.708
I'm not getting into this
with you right now.

16:56.708 --> 16:59.583
So sensitive,
so testy.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.333
Come on, Ray-Ray.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.834
I'm not calling you
a waste of space.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.416
I'm calling you
a waste of potential.

17:06.416 --> 17:10.125
I'm going home,
wherever the fuck that is.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.541
- ( phone ringing )
- ( music playing on TV )

17:18.165 --> 17:20.583
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.458
I got my Tracy on,
and you're right,
it's amazing.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.541
All these tiny muscles
I didn't know I had.

17:25.541 --> 17:26.959
Yeah, it's a really
great program.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.333
I'll get those tapes
back from you

17:28.333 --> 17:30.000
just as soon
as my knee's healed.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.041
Mom, I have blood
in my pee again.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.792
Again?
Let me see.

17:37.542 --> 17:38.959
Mm, sorry.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.625
Ooh.
Okay, okay.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.250
You have to go
to the ER.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.458
I don't wanna go
to the ER, Mom.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.000
I'm on deadline.
I can't.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.166
All right,
Hannah, just go.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.542
Fine.

17:50.542 --> 17:55.125
No one's making movies about
actual human people anymore.

17:55.125 --> 17:56.959
And that's
where we come in.

17:56.959 --> 17:59.625
You know, it has to be
raw and honest, real.

17:59.625 --> 18:02.125
Yeah, and the only shit
that's real is shit that
actually happened.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.667
Yes. Yes!

18:03.667 --> 18:06.250
We have to mine our lives
for the truth.

18:06.250 --> 18:08.333
You know, like,
even if it fucking hurts,

18:08.333 --> 18:11.667
even if it's too painful
for us to even comprehend.

18:12.750 --> 18:13.834
Yes.

18:15.917 --> 18:18.667
Adam, like us.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.041
Like us with Hannah.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.166
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Yes. Yes!

18:23.166 --> 18:25.125
- We can't.
- What do you mean we can't?

18:25.125 --> 18:27.583
It's perfect.
It's perfect.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.333
It's about
relationships,

18:29.333 --> 18:32.000
it-- it's about
loyalty and deceit,

18:32.000 --> 18:35.083
and it's raw,
it's powerfully true, Adam.

18:35.083 --> 18:37.834
And it might even
be cathartic for us.

18:37.834 --> 18:41.667
You know, help us to
move on from this mess
and be free.

18:41.667 --> 18:44.834
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yes!

18:44.834 --> 18:47.041
I'm, like,
so sweaty right now.

18:47.041 --> 18:48.542
- This might be it.
- Yes.

18:48.542 --> 18:50.583
It explains everything
about human nature.

18:50.583 --> 18:52.708
How even with
the best of intentions

18:52.708 --> 18:54.417
we can't help
but hurt each other.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.083
- Yes!
- It's like
a metaphor for war

18:56.083 --> 18:59.083
and-- and corporations
and religious strife.

18:59.083 --> 19:01.708
- All that shit! Yes!
- Yes, yes!

19:01.708 --> 19:03.500
- ( squeals )
- Oh, Jesus!

19:03.500 --> 19:04.875
Adam!

19:04.875 --> 19:08.208
Oh, my God.
We might be a pair
of goddamn geniuses.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.041
( moaning )

19:11.208 --> 19:12.166
- Wait.
- What?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.208
We have to
shoot it on film.

19:14.208 --> 19:18.500
Yep. Okay.
Like, fine.
( chuckles )

19:18.500 --> 19:20.708
- In black and white.
- ( mutters )

19:20.708 --> 19:21.708
- Too much?
- Yeah.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.917
Yeah, too much.
( moans )

19:27.708 --> 19:29.333
I'm slipping.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.417
- ( chatter )
- ( phone rings )

19:37.083 --> 19:39.250
Oh, fuck.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.333
Oh, shit.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.000
I'm not sure
if you remember me.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.083
Uh, I remember you.

19:48.959 --> 19:52.083
- How you doing?
- Good.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.708
Good, yeah.

19:53.708 --> 19:56.166
Yeah, I mean,
I'm in private practice now.

19:56.166 --> 19:59.417
Just pick up a few shifts
a week here to help...

19:59.417 --> 20:01.583
The uninsured.
It's very noble.

20:01.583 --> 20:03.625
But I do want you to know
I tried to sign up
for Obamacare

20:03.625 --> 20:05.250
and the website
fucked me over, so...

20:05.250 --> 20:07.834
Well, I'll get
right on that.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.417
Um, I have a UTI.

20:09.417 --> 20:13.458
I get them all the time,
so I need, like, Cipro,
Pyridium,

20:13.458 --> 20:16.291
codeine if you're feeling,
you know, fun and fancy.
( chuckles )

20:17.875 --> 20:21.000
Yes, your urine
tested positive
for infection.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.041
In the future,

20:23.041 --> 20:26.000
I'd come see us
a few days earlier
when the symptoms start.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.125
Yeah, it's just sometimes
hard to tell if it's, like,

20:28.125 --> 20:31.959
just the baseline level
of weirdness of my urethra
or an actual issue,

20:31.959 --> 20:34.875
so it's like
what's being alive
and what's an infection?

20:34.875 --> 20:37.458
- These are my questions.
- ( both chuckling )

20:37.458 --> 20:40.458
I'm not sure if you--
if you pee after intercourse,

20:40.458 --> 20:42.750
but that can also help
in preventing them.

20:42.750 --> 20:44.792
And, plus,
you're pregnant.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.083
Do you know that?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.208
I do now.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.500
( sighs )

21:06.458 --> 21:09.000
You know what?
The hug kind of feels
like the wrong thing,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.500
so I'm gonna...

21:14.708 --> 21:16.667
Do you know
who the father is?

21:17.834 --> 21:20.375
Yeah, he's
a waterski instructor

21:20.375 --> 21:23.166
who I'm not likely
to see again, so...

21:23.166 --> 21:25.458
He's thrilled.
( chuckles )

21:27.792 --> 21:29.542
Listen, um...

21:31.166 --> 21:33.041
the abortion is
an out-of-pocket expense,

21:33.041 --> 21:35.000
but if you need help,
I can bring you.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.917
I can have
a friend handle it,
somebody I trust.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.875
What makes you think
I want an abortion?

21:43.041 --> 21:45.542
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hmm.

21:45.542 --> 21:48.834
Thanks for your help.
I'll just use my expired
antibiotics.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.000
( sighs )

22:06.834 --> 22:09.792
Ray:
How dare Hermie accuse me
of wasting my potential?

22:09.792 --> 22:11.500
Huh?
The audacity.

22:11.500 --> 22:13.166
What has he done
with his life?

22:13.166 --> 22:16.208
He's got 20 years of
wasted potential on me. 25!

22:16.208 --> 22:18.625
Okay, well, maybe that's why
he's being so hard on you,

22:18.625 --> 22:20.834
because, you know,
he doesn't want you
to end up like him.

22:20.834 --> 22:23.917
Yeah, because I won't
end up like him, ever.

22:23.917 --> 22:25.000
Okay.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.250
- Okay!
- Okay.

22:27.542 --> 22:29.834
Fuck, I'm gonna totally
end up like him.

22:29.834 --> 22:32.583
- Well, I mean...
- And even if I did
end up like him,

22:32.583 --> 22:34.583
is that so wrong,
is that so bad?

22:34.583 --> 22:36.917
He's got a wife,
he's got a business,

22:36.917 --> 22:39.500
he's got the wisdom
of a thousand fortune cookies.

22:39.500 --> 22:41.959
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe that's--

22:41.959 --> 22:45.125
maybe I'd be totally fine
if I ended up like him.

22:45.125 --> 22:47.750
Well, maybe he wants you
to have a life that's
better than fine.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.500
Yeah.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.291
Fuck, you're right.

22:52.291 --> 22:53.667
That's exactly
what he wants.

22:53.667 --> 22:56.250
He wants me
to be a better
version of himself.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.041
- I'm gonna go apologize
to him right now.
- Okay, good.

22:59.041 --> 23:01.750
And you know what?
Yeah, maybe it is time
I make some changes.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.458
Maybe it is time
I do something
fucking real.

23:04.458 --> 23:08.208
- Uh-huh.
- You know, something
people will remember.

23:08.208 --> 23:11.750
- You know?
- W-wait, like kill yourself?

23:11.750 --> 23:13.375
What?

23:13.375 --> 23:14.834
I'm sorry,
it just really sounded like

23:14.834 --> 23:16.625
you were
gearing up to that.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.333
I'm not gonna
kill myself, Shosh.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.000
- Okay, good.
- Good.

23:20.000 --> 23:22.125
- Do you wanna kill yourself?
- No, don't. No.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.458
- We'll talk about
this later.
- Great.

23:25.458 --> 23:27.000
- Shoshanna: Or not.
- ( door closes )

23:27.000 --> 23:29.792
That got real fast.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.458
( door closes )

23:37.458 --> 23:39.125
- Hi.
- Hey.

23:39.125 --> 23:42.291
We're here to discuss
a creative project with you.

23:42.291 --> 23:44.166
Well, uh, it's--
it's a film.

23:44.166 --> 23:46.000
- Yeah.
- It's a film
about the complex dynamic

23:46.000 --> 23:47.834
that the three of us have
been fostering for years now

23:47.834 --> 23:49.291
if you really think
about it.

23:49.291 --> 23:51.166
And I know it's really,
really painful,

23:51.166 --> 23:52.458
so you don't have to
make the decision now

23:52.458 --> 23:53.917
whether you wanna
sign a release or not.

23:53.917 --> 23:55.750
No, no, no.
No, we're so not there yet.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.500
- We're way far down.
- We, um-- no.

23:57.500 --> 24:00.500
We just want you to think
about how rich this is,
cinematically.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.667
You know?
And to think about
the story that we could tell.

24:03.667 --> 24:06.417
And we just
would really hope

24:06.417 --> 24:09.166
that you will grant us
permission to share

24:09.166 --> 24:11.041
what has transpired
with the world

24:11.041 --> 24:13.375
and sort of
elegantly unfold this--

24:13.375 --> 24:14.834
This little package,
really.

24:14.834 --> 24:16.291
It's-- I mean, eh.

24:16.291 --> 24:19.041
You guys should do
whatever you want.

24:38.834 --> 24:41.542
- Hey.
- Hey. What about
the party?

24:41.542 --> 24:43.208
Ugh, it was
total bullshit.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.917
It was just, like,
a bunch of old gays

24:44.917 --> 24:47.500
being like,
"Oh, I'm so busy
during the week.

24:47.500 --> 24:49.708
I can only do uppers
on the weekends."

24:49.708 --> 24:51.917
Oh, well,
good for you, Anthony.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.792
- Did you go to the ER?
- Uh-huh.

24:55.792 --> 24:58.375
Yeah?
You get some drugs,
little Eponine?

24:58.375 --> 24:59.667
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.917
Did they give you
something for the pain?

25:02.917 --> 25:04.875
Mm-mm.

25:04.875 --> 25:06.959
Those unfeeling
bastards.

25:08.041 --> 25:09.875
Come, come.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.750
Put your little head
on my lap.

25:12.917 --> 25:14.875
Come, come.

25:14.875 --> 25:16.583
There you go.

25:16.583 --> 25:18.458
Come here,
little girl.

25:18.458 --> 25:20.125
( sniffs )

25:21.917 --> 25:24.708
I'm sorry I'm using
my pizza hand.

25:24.708 --> 25:27.542
Just adding more grease
to this situation.

25:27.542 --> 25:30.458

Hermie?

26:06.458 --> 26:08.083
You there?

26:10.500 --> 26:12.959
I'm opening up,
you deaf bastard.

26:15.333 --> 26:16.792
Coming in.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.166
Hermie?

26:30.166 --> 26:31.041
Hermie?

26:32.166 --> 26:33.834
Hermie?

26:35.750 --> 26:37.166

26:38.834 --> 26:40.000
Hey.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.208
Hermie?

26:43.208 --> 26:45.166
Hey, wake up.
I gotta talk to you.

26:46.250 --> 26:47.625
Hey.

26:47.625 --> 26:48.959
Hermie.

26:48.959 --> 26:50.291
Hey.

26:51.667 --> 26:52.667
Hermie.

26:53.750 --> 26:55.375
Hey, Hermie.

just maybe not

29:14.333 --> 29:16.041
-in this exact house.
-Right.

29:16.041 --> 29:17.834
I just don't understand
the point of this scene.

29:17.834 --> 29:19.875
-Did you even read the script?
-No I didn't read the script!

29:19.875 --> 29:21.708

I don't need to read scripts.

LENA DUNHAM: This episode
is called "Painful Evacuation."

29:45.125 --> 29:46.667
-JENNI KONNER: Yes.
-It's a big reveal episode.

29:46.667 --> 29:47.500
It sure is.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.500
'Cause it kind of...
It puts into motion

29:49.500 --> 29:52.166
the entire arc
of the, uh, season,

29:52.166 --> 29:53.667
which is Hannah's pregnancy.

29:55.417 --> 29:56.417
Oh, fuck.

29:57.542 --> 29:58.583
Oh, shit.

29:58.917 --> 30:01.667
I mean, I remember just
in the writer's rooms thinking

30:01.875 --> 30:03.208
what would be the worst way

30:03.208 --> 30:04.417
-for her to find out?
-Yeah.

30:04.417 --> 30:05.792
And it's like from someone
you had sex with

30:05.792 --> 30:08.041
and humiliated yourself around,
who you hope never

30:08.041 --> 30:10.333
to run into again.
And he is your doctor,

30:10.333 --> 30:12.375
and is telling you
to pee after intercourse.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.333
I mean, I think our intention
was for it to be

30:14.333 --> 30:16.083
a humiliation and then a shock,

30:16.083 --> 30:18.667
but I'm so glad it worked
as a shock and then a shock.

30:18.667 --> 30:20.875
And it's also a humiliation
then a humiliation.

30:20.875 --> 30:22.834
'Cause he's, like, telling her
she's pregnant,

30:22.834 --> 30:24.583
and I think she feels like
there's an inherent

30:24.583 --> 30:26.458
judgment of him thinking
she's irresponsible,

30:26.458 --> 30:27.542
-thinking she can't--
-And also thinking

30:27.542 --> 30:28.542
she's just gonna have
an abortion

30:28.542 --> 30:29.417
-no matter what.
-Yeah.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.041
Yeah. And I think it's...
She surprises even herself

30:32.041 --> 30:33.917
when she's not
immediately like,

30:34.125 --> 30:36.375
"Yes. When and where
can I have my abortion?"

30:36.625 --> 30:38.708
Thanks for your help. I'll just
use my expired antibiotics.

LENA DUNHAM:
We were shooting that

30:43.250 --> 30:45.125
and then went straight
into shooting

30:45.125 --> 30:47.166
Marnie and Desi in their
couples therapy

30:47.166 --> 30:48.542
in the same hospital, so...

30:48.875 --> 30:50.583
We really had a day of it
in the hospital.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.834
The idea, Desi,
that I have in some way

30:53.834 --> 30:56.750
caused you to develop
an addiction to something is...

30:58.041 --> 30:59.708
-absurd.
-No, that's...

31:00.083 --> 31:02.166
-No, it's--
-Oh, my God!

31:02.166 --> 31:03.417
DUNHAM:
The funny thing is that, like,

31:03.750 --> 31:06.417
she's there, so she's, like,
willing to put in the work,

31:06.417 --> 31:10.000
but she won't take
responsibility for anything.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.583
And like, Desi's
by no means an angel,

31:12.583 --> 31:14.583
but, like, the idea of, like,
"It takes two to tango."

31:14.583 --> 31:16.125
She's basically like, "No,
you did drugs,

31:16.125 --> 31:17.750
and I was perfect."

31:17.750 --> 31:19.959
And trying to win over
the therapist

31:19.959 --> 31:21.458
-DUNHAM: Just...
-...is a very Marnie move.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.708
DUNHAM: When Ebon pours
the glass of water,

31:25.708 --> 31:27.458
-then drinks all of it...
-KONNER: Oh, right.

31:27.458 --> 31:28.959
is just a moment
of Ebon genius.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.208
That's just straight up
Ebon improv.

31:31.750 --> 31:34.125
And also then he had to do it
on, like, ten takes.

31:34.125 --> 31:35.667
The amount of water
that he drank

31:35.667 --> 31:36.917
just to commit to his joke.

31:37.250 --> 31:39.625
-KONNER: A well-hydrated man.
-DUNHAM: Yeah, he was so funny.

31:39.625 --> 31:41.542
And also, just the way
that he kept

31:41.542 --> 31:43.291
looking at his therapist
with like desperation.

31:43.291 --> 31:45.166
Like they were both looking
at the therapist for approval.

31:45.166 --> 31:46.959
It fucking slays me.

31:46.959 --> 31:50.625
I just quit the fucking movie.
Fuck! The fuck did I do?

31:50.625 --> 31:52.708
DUNHAM: Adam is so
frustrated at this point

31:52.708 --> 31:54.708
about his career
and his artistry,

31:54.708 --> 31:56.500
and we wanted to
push this idea that, like,

31:56.500 --> 31:59.250
Jessa thinks that
she can sort of be his...

31:59.250 --> 32:01.250
both his muse and his protector.

32:01.250 --> 32:03.000
I'm like so sweaty right now.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.625
-Yes!
-(SQUEALS) Yes!

32:05.166 --> 32:06.250
-(SQUEALS)
-Oh, Jesus.

32:06.583 --> 32:10.083
They do have, like, a little bit
of crazed mutual delusion.

32:10.083 --> 32:12.708
Like, they go through these
really manic highs

32:12.708 --> 32:14.166
and super low lows together.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.917
And this thing where they decide
they're gonna make a movie

32:15.917 --> 32:17.959
it's like... They're
like possessed.

32:17.959 --> 32:19.083
Let's just say...

32:19.917 --> 32:21.917
we're happy they're
both still alive.

32:22.166 --> 32:22.834
Yeah.

32:23.583 --> 32:25.166
Like, those characters
really could have wound up

32:25.166 --> 32:27.250
in a bed having stabbed
each other for sure.

32:27.250 --> 32:29.083
The fact that they're both
just, like, okay,

32:29.083 --> 32:30.875
seemingly sober,
and, like, haven't set

32:30.875 --> 32:32.959
their apartment on fire
is a fucking miracle.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.166
Right. So they're doing great.
Just being alive.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.166
Yeah.

32:36.166 --> 32:37.000
Come, come.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.542
Put your little head on my lap.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.834
DUNHAM: Something else
that I love in that episode

32:43.834 --> 32:47.458
is just that moment at the end
when Elijah comforts Hannah,

32:47.458 --> 32:50.083
and, like, she doesn't have
to tell him what's going on.

32:50.083 --> 32:53.000
He's just there. And that felt
really cozy and sweet

32:53.000 --> 32:55.291
and, like, you knew
that no matter what,

32:55.291 --> 32:56.583
that it was gonna be
kind of okay.
