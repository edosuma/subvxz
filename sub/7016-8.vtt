00:03.851 --> 00:06.399
Well Miss Kitty, thank you so much for having lunch with me.

00:07.014 --> 00:10.923
Well I'm always up for a salad and a Martini in the middle of the day.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.561
You didn't have a salad.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.018
Well olives and onions are almost a salad.

00:21.198 --> 00:23.270
Well I am just glad I can come to you with all my problems.

00:23.325 --> 00:26.444
Well sure you can Fez. You can talk to me about anything.

00:26.970 --> 00:27.839
Just to double-check,

00:28.097 --> 00:31.151
are you sure it's normal for one of them to hang lower then the other?

00:34.200 --> 00:35.597
Well of course Fez!

00:36.031 --> 00:38.534
Nobody's earlobes are perfectly symmetrical.

00:43.782 --> 00:44.745
Kitty Forman?

00:47.115 --> 00:48.888
Marcia Sullivan?

00:50.680 --> 00:51.807
How are you?

00:52.069 --> 00:53.689
And how is that husband of yours?

00:53.830 --> 00:56.113
Great. He lost 3000 pounds...

00:58.093 --> 00:59.901
when I took his Mercedes in the divorce.

01:01.276 --> 01:05.515
Oh you are divorced, what a shame. And they say fourth time's a charm!

01:05.620 --> 01:07.311
Ahahaha!

01:07.672 --> 01:09.445
Well you know what, you should come over.

01:09.446 --> 01:11.394
It's sounds like we've got a lot of catching up to do.

01:11.482 --> 01:13.795
I'd love that! I'll bring a bottle of wine.

01:13.963 --> 01:15.713
Oh well that is terrific!

01:17.192 --> 01:18.747
I can't wait to see you!

01:20.648 --> 01:21.000
Slut!

01:21.434 --> 01:22.244
Tight-ass...

01:25.105 --> 01:27.031
Ah Mrs. Sullivan, hello.

01:27.765 --> 01:29.878
What can these magic hands do for you today?

01:30.534 --> 01:31.556
Actually...

01:32.201 --> 01:34.369
I was thinking of trying something new...

01:38.661 --> 01:41.637
Well...perhaps we should "rinse and repeat"...

01:48.012 --> 01:55.039
Saison 8 Episode 8

02:21.732 --> 02:24.421
Donna, this is gonna be your first birthday since breaking up with Eric.

02:24.955 --> 02:25.793
You know what that means...

02:26.110 --> 02:28.500
no crappy gifts to return to the Science Fiction-store!

02:30.204 --> 02:30.745
Yeah,

02:30.803 --> 02:33.774
I mean guess it'll be kind of a relief not having to give him his birthday spanking.

02:35.928 --> 02:38.124
He made you spank HIM on YOUR birthday?

02:39.169 --> 02:39.803
Yeah

02:40.155 --> 02:41.999
and then he danced around in his underwear going:

02:42.562 --> 02:44.471
Happy Birthday to meee...

02:47.040 --> 02:48.496
Sorry to keep you from work.

02:48.757 --> 02:51.247
Oh don't worry, I already called in and said I was having sex.

02:53.422 --> 02:53.998
Oh.

02:54.467 --> 02:54.873
Hello.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.751
Oh my God. Fez just banged an old...

03:00.845 --> 03:05.511
...s mobile in the driveway with his bike...

03:07.765 --> 03:09.420
Marcia, I would like you to meet my friends,

03:09.444 --> 03:12.116
friends I would like you to meet the most ferocious lover on two legs.

03:13.537 --> 03:15.592
Which by the way, was new for me

03:19.429 --> 03:21.167
Oh... eeewww...

03:22.018 --> 03:24.296
It's like watching somebody kiss their grandmother.

03:26.153 --> 03:28.302
Ouhh, my nana don't kiss like that!

03:31.179 --> 03:33.210
Mrs. Sullivan, may I ask you something?

03:34.565 --> 03:35.275
Was I good?

03:37.416 --> 03:37.980
Good enough.

03:38.700 --> 03:39.334
YES!

03:41.478 --> 03:42.453
Nice job Fez.

03:42.845 --> 03:44.677
Combine two of your favourite passtimes.

03:45.259 --> 03:45.804
Sex...

03:46.414 --> 03:47.037
and antiquing.

03:49.953 --> 03:50.469
You know,

03:50.868 --> 03:52.900
for years older men have dated younger women.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.528
And now it's finally okay for a younger man to date an older woman.

03:57.150 --> 03:58.536
I guess what I'm trying to say is:

03:58.806 --> 03:59.569
GROSS!

04:01.461 --> 04:05.160
Say what you want, but Mrs. Sullivan is so much more passionate then girls your age.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.238
You kids just lie there.

04:09.639 --> 04:12.844
Mrs. Sullivan, she moves, she shakes, she makes noises.

04:15.543 --> 04:17.069
Are you sure she wasn't having a stroke?

04:23.952 --> 04:27.287
Hey, so I was thinking we could all go in together on a birthdaypresent for Donna?

04:27.643 --> 04:28.466
But I don't know what to get her....

04:30.349 --> 04:33.120
Oh cool, there's an echo inside my head!

04:34.517 --> 04:35.527
Hellooooww......

04:37.558 --> 04:38.385
Balls.....

04:39.841 --> 04:41.896
Hohohoho! Awesome!

04:43.310 --> 04:46.445
You know I could give Donna make-up. But that would be a waste.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.110
Might as well just give a dog a snowblower.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.836
Oh. Kelso did that once.

04:52.763 --> 04:53.292
Oh no wait,

04:54.031 --> 04:55.505
he gave his snowblower a dog.

04:56.578 --> 04:59.184
That was when he was in his "Machines-Should-Have-Pets" phase.

05:00.875 --> 05:02.132
Bongoooooo's!

05:03.819 --> 05:05.009
Equadoooooor!

05:06.174 --> 05:07.512
Is there anybody in here?

05:09.231 --> 05:09.982
Oh my God,

05:10.722 --> 05:11.873
the echo just said yes.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.367
You know, I think I've had enough...

05:16.445 --> 05:19.686
You know once I caught Donna using lipliner on her eyebrows.

05:21.189 --> 05:23.773
Seriously, it's like being best friends with Phyllis Diller.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.619
How about, I get something and we can all give it to Donna together?

05:30.236 --> 05:30.846
Together.

05:31.989 --> 05:33.163
Man, I'm not getting the echo.

05:36.087 --> 05:36.627
Hello?

05:38.827 --> 05:39.708
There it is...

05:44.247 --> 05:46.709
Oh oh oh, my friend Marcia Sullivan is here!

05:47.336 --> 05:48.534
Your friend? I thought you hated her?

05:48.557 --> 05:49.684
I do!

05:51.010 --> 05:56.176
But she has the juciest gossip because she is a filthy, disgusting, piece of...

05:56.270 --> 05:57.268
Marcia!

05:58.328 --> 06:00.218
Hello Kitty. Hello Red.

06:00.923 --> 06:04.132
Here Kitty, I brought us some heavenly camomile tea.

06:05.747 --> 06:06.874
Oh yeah. Tea's nice...

06:09.457 --> 06:11.301
You said you were gonna bring wine.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.847
She also said "till death do us part",

06:15.211 --> 06:16.372
look how that worked out.

06:18.432 --> 06:20.287
Red, don't you have something to do in the garage?

06:21.276 --> 06:22.403
I can go to the garage?

06:27.184 --> 06:28.452
So Marcia...

06:30.395 --> 06:33.372
Tell me what is going on in that adventurous life of yours?

06:33.502 --> 06:36.966
Well actually Kitty, I have a wonderful new boyfriend.

06:37.248 --> 06:39.772
He's delicious. And quite young.

06:41.159 --> 06:41.650
Young?

06:42.413 --> 06:43.012
How young?

06:44.093 --> 06:44.457
40?

06:46.844 --> 06:47.337
Younger.

06:48.305 --> 06:49.292
39?

06:51.095 --> 06:51.799
Younger.

06:52.694 --> 06:55.030
Well for heaven's sake Marcia, what is younger then 39?

06:57.127 --> 06:59.417
Kitty I am not gonna tell you. I don't want to shock you.

06:59.884 --> 07:00.812
19.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.162
Well I just don't believe this.

07:04.773 --> 07:06.364
I have a son who is 19.

07:06.756 --> 07:07.472
Oh that's right.

07:07.789 --> 07:08.834
I forgot about Eric.

07:09.492 --> 07:11.676
Where is that handsome son of yours these days?

07:12.180 --> 07:12.673
Oh.

07:12.796 --> 07:16.882
Don't you even think about it. He is in Africa, with the lions, where he's safe.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.045
Well he's gotta come back sometime.

07:22.467 --> 07:24.405
Touch him and I'll kill you in your sleep!

07:26.539 --> 07:29.956
OH...Ahahahaha!

07:35.480 --> 07:35.855
Well

07:36.712 --> 07:38.732
another day, another romp with Mrs. Sullivan.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.835
Actually is was three romps, but who is counting?

07:45.312 --> 07:46.017
It was four.

07:48.910 --> 07:50.390
Hey guys, I got Donna's birthday present.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.355
It's a little wrinkled and musty but

07:52.636 --> 07:54.280
so is Fez' girlfriend and he seems to like her.

07:57.408 --> 08:00.613
"My parents went to Lake Michigan and all I got was this lousy t-shirt."

08:02.380 --> 08:03.120
I can relate too.

08:03.425 --> 08:04.521
My mom once went to Lake Michigan.

08:04.874 --> 08:05.836
All I got was a half-brother.

08:08.901 --> 08:09.383
T-shirt ?

08:10.281 --> 08:11.185
What a lousy present.

08:11.832 --> 08:13.217
It even says so, right on the present.

08:14.308 --> 08:14.913
Hey,

08:14.954 --> 08:16.926
if you guys don't like the present, you can steal her something better.

08:19.339 --> 08:19.868
Okay well,

08:20.149 --> 08:21.893
what kind of stuff is Donna into anyway?

08:23.327 --> 08:23.996
I don't know.

08:25.282 --> 08:25.751
Beef?

08:27.587 --> 08:29.912
No, seriously, Donna is a cool girl.

08:30.147 --> 08:31.415
I think we should get her something cool.

08:32.344 --> 08:33.976
Why because you wanna have sex with her?

08:36.751 --> 08:39.134
No, I'd do the same thing for you if it were your birthday.

08:39.416 --> 08:40.672
Ah, so you wanna have sex with me?

08:43.621 --> 08:44.513
Yeah Fez,

08:44.584 --> 08:45.817
I wanna have sex with you!

08:48.730 --> 08:49.739
I rather have a sweater...

08:53.267 --> 08:54.136
and it's August 4th.

08:59.515 --> 09:01.910
If you can't find gift ideas for Donna in here,

09:02.286 --> 09:03.425
just give her what I do,

09:03.812 --> 09:06.149
coupons for 15 minutes of Bob-time.

09:08.962 --> 09:09.631
You know I...

09:10.018 --> 09:12.026
I always forget how big Donna's room is.

09:12.707 --> 09:14.691
It looks much smaller from the tree across the street.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.988
Hey look at this!

09:19.078 --> 09:20.537
Donna uses the same hairspray as...

09:23.824 --> 09:24.400
my sister.

09:26.888 --> 09:29.209
Ohhh look at this. Donna's diary.

09:29.803 --> 09:32.029
Oh I haven't looked in here in like a month.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.333
Ah damn, it's locked.

09:36.809 --> 09:38.535
Ah the keys are in one of the desk drawers.

09:40.884 --> 09:41.858
I'm not sure which.

09:42.496 --> 09:44.128
There's always a branch blocking my view.

09:46.730 --> 09:50.405
Eh okay, I'm heading out, but I think what Donna needs for her birthday.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.519
Thicker curtains and a restraining order

09:55.573 --> 09:56.511
Oh my God Fez,

09:56.848 --> 09:58.923
listen to what Donna wrote, it's from a few weeks ago:

09:59.695 --> 10:03.147
"Hyde hired this new guy Randy at the record-store. And he's really cute."

10:04.546 --> 10:05.937
Donna thinks Randy is cute!

10:06.466 --> 10:07.593
Can you believe this?

10:08.051 --> 10:09.448
Jackie you shouldn't be reading that!

10:11.397 --> 10:13.158
It's a complete invasion of privacy.

10:14.802 --> 10:18.508
Oh if I get just the right angle on this mirror...I can see Donna when she sleeps...

10:24.434 --> 10:25.021
Here Donna,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.643
I made you a coupon for your birthday.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.829
"Good for one Knock-Knock-joke. No Who's-there required".

10:37.753 --> 10:40.031
Wow, dreams can come true.

10:42.392 --> 10:42.989
See that Red?

10:43.523 --> 10:44.421
Kids love those.

10:44.820 --> 10:45.785
You should have made them for Eric.

10:46.593 --> 10:48.331
Yeah I suppose I could have given him a

10:48.449 --> 10:50.219
"Get My Foot Out Of Your Ass Free" card.

10:53.332 --> 10:55.258
Ladies and gentleman, I present to you

10:55.422 --> 10:58.593
a simply sweet confection and she is carrying a cake too!

10:58.767 --> 11:01.268
Oh my goodness stop it!

11:01.291 --> 11:03.179
Ahahahaha!

11:04.173 --> 11:06.462
Wow Randy, look at your shirt.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.642
Uhh Donna, how would you describe Randy's shirt?

11:11.254 --> 11:12.240
Uhm...

11:13.129 --> 11:14.010
well-buttoned?

11:16.826 --> 11:17.730
CUTE!

11:17.983 --> 11:19.545
You would say it's cute!

11:20.763 --> 11:23.355
I'm sorry, the answer we were looking for was "adorable".

11:30.339 --> 11:30.879
Marcia!

11:31.562 --> 11:32.936
Ahhh there's my lady!

11:39.947 --> 11:41.809
What in the world?

11:44.083 --> 11:45.345
Oh, you didn't know?

11:46.032 --> 11:47.348
Yeah, Fez is dating an older lady.

11:48.143 --> 11:50.985
Apparently, you taking him to all these PTA-meetings really payed off.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.607
Fez is your younger man? MY Fez?

11:55.808 --> 11:56.959
Isn't he gorgeous?

11:57.525 --> 11:59.674
I think I'll keep him for a couple of months.

12:01.159 --> 12:01.735
Did you hear that?

12:01.970 --> 12:02.932
I'm booked till March.

12:05.704 --> 12:06.867
Fez you can't date her.

12:07.341 --> 12:07.752
Why not?

12:08.092 --> 12:09.595
Well in the first place: she's so...

12:10.240 --> 12:10.959
old.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.194
Isn't she kind of the same age as Mrs. Forman?

12:17.147 --> 12:18.947
Yeah say that louder, that'll really help.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.204
How dare you dig your... your

12:23.427 --> 12:26.175
dirty claws into this innocent boy?

12:26.669 --> 12:29.112
Wow, it's like she was right in the room with us.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.507
Fez, this is an atrocity.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.262
You two have to stop seeing each other right now.

12:38.579 --> 12:40.234
You can't tell me what to do, your not my mother.

12:43.939 --> 12:44.538
You know what...

12:46.029 --> 12:46.516
Fine,

12:47.514 --> 12:50.038
then you just...you do whatever the hell you want

12:54.779 --> 12:55.284
Marcia!

12:56.157 --> 12:57.446
It's me, Bob Pinciotti.

12:58.038 --> 12:58.355
Ahhh.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.294
I asked you out last month.

13:01.470 --> 13:03.038
I thought you were moving to Costa Rica.

13:10.528 --> 13:11.127
Kitty?

13:12.103 --> 13:13.397
Oh no!

13:15.793 --> 13:16.474
What's wrong?

13:16.631 --> 13:17.154
Ice,

13:17.694 --> 13:18.357
Margarita-mix,

13:20.492 --> 13:22.136
the top from the bottle of tequila.

13:24.706 --> 13:26.091
Good Lord, she took the blender!

13:30.548 --> 13:31.628
She's in the dining room.

13:33.007 --> 13:34.792
I'll be in the garage. Save yourselves!

13:41.820 --> 13:46.258
I can't believe Fez was seduced by that cradle-robbing slut.

13:48.206 --> 13:51.764
You girls throw it around like footballplayers, couldn't one of you have slept with him?

13:55.802 --> 13:56.824
Mrs. Forman,

13:57.211 --> 13:58.807
you need to understand something.

13:59.641 --> 14:01.402
Fez is a deviant weirdo.

14:01.877 --> 14:04.608
We're just glad he is doing it with a person and not a couch

14:05.042 --> 14:06.404
a tree or my pillow.

14:07.837 --> 14:11.795
After all I have done for that boy, he has the nerve to say you're not my mother.

14:12.822 --> 14:14.220
If that's even what he said.

14:14.525 --> 14:15.195
Because...

14:15.583 --> 14:19.223
who can understand anything that comes out of that ungrateful marsh-mouth.

14:21.869 --> 14:22.256
Wow.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.775
Fez and an older divorced woman.

14:25.890 --> 14:26.360
You know,

14:26.889 --> 14:30.853
if I were a divorced older woman, I would take everything from my ex-husband.

14:31.557 --> 14:35.361
SUFFER YOU CHEATING BASTARD! Haa! Can't wait to be divorced.

14:37.569 --> 14:37.969
Well,

14:38.502 --> 14:40.756
if he doesn't want me mothering him, fine I'm done!

14:41.323 --> 14:42.192
Next Christmas,

14:42.473 --> 14:45.890
his stocking will not be hung by the chimney with care.

14:46.172 --> 14:48.487
It will be tossed in the garbage with...

14:49.849 --> 14:50.460
hair!

14:53.522 --> 14:55.388
This place uses too much ice!

15:03.097 --> 15:03.743
Here you go Donna.

15:04.635 --> 15:05.175
Happy birthday.

15:08.522 --> 15:10.271
I was gonna put a ribbon around it, but you know,

15:10.953 --> 15:11.540
I barely care.

15:13.062 --> 15:13.894
Wow Hyde,

15:14.851 --> 15:17.880
thanks! I have the same shirt from the other lakes but I needed this one.

15:18.634 --> 15:19.033
Wait.

15:20.360 --> 15:21.663
You collect these shirts?

15:22.274 --> 15:23.473
Steven how did you know that?

15:23.904 --> 15:25.572
Oh because one time I heard Donna say:

15:25.736 --> 15:26.793
I collect these shirts.

15:28.373 --> 15:30.440
I like when Donna wears shirts with writing on them.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.302
The words just pop out at you.

15:35.012 --> 15:35.423
Donna,

15:35.828 --> 15:37.807
for your birthday, I'm taking you on a journey.

15:38.269 --> 15:39.209
Where you ask?

15:39.717 --> 15:41.196
To a Journey-concert!

15:42.198 --> 15:42.999
Why you ask?

15:43.107 --> 15:45.141
Cause I saw you had a poster of them in your room.

15:45.565 --> 15:47.209
What was I doing in your room you ask?

15:47.362 --> 15:47.796
Hey,

15:47.960 --> 15:49.158
stop asking questions,

15:49.252 --> 15:50.544
we're going to see Journey!

15:52.055 --> 15:53.194
Oh thanks !

15:53.381 --> 15:55.272
Donna, I'm sorry I didn't get you a present.

15:55.659 --> 15:57.061
I was gonna go shopping, but

15:57.331 --> 15:59.222
Mrs. Sullivan is not gonna be around forever.

16:01.423 --> 16:02.997
I gotta make every moment count.

16:04.958 --> 16:06.631
Eh yeah Fez, about that.

16:07.242 --> 16:10.007
We just talked to Mrs. Forman and we learned a couple of things.

16:10.377 --> 16:14.110
First of all, you get a few Margarita's in her and she's a fairly decent tapdancer.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.814
And also,

16:17.413 --> 16:19.386
she is really upset about what you said.

16:20.124 --> 16:21.568
Yeah Fez, she thinks of you like a son.

16:22.544 --> 16:23.037
I mean,

16:23.378 --> 16:24.317
you know, think about it.

17:22.540 --> 17:23.222
You know,

17:23.691 --> 17:25.230
Miss Kitty has done a lot for me.

17:26.304 --> 17:27.325
Maybe I should go talk to her.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.648
And on the way I'll pick up a box of chocolates.

17:31.080 --> 17:31.543
Good.

17:31.824 --> 17:33.421
Yeah Fez, I think she'd really like that.

17:33.984 --> 17:35.217
Oh then I'll pick her up one too.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.011
Happy birthday. I got you a new diary.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.156
Well I noticed you needed a new one when I was reading your old one.

17:51.337 --> 17:52.829
YOU READ MY DIARY?

17:52.930 --> 17:53.681
I didn't say that!!

17:53.771 --> 17:54.887
You just said that!

17:55.452 --> 17:57.284
Oh you don't know what I said.

17:59.062 --> 17:59.708
But,

18:00.083 --> 18:02.232
I also noticed you think Randy is cute.

18:03.293 --> 18:03.739
What?

18:04.857 --> 18:07.323
I do not, that was just something I wrote, I barely meant it.

18:07.550 --> 18:08.371
Oh uhuh!

18:08.383 --> 18:10.250
Then why are you going to the concert with him?

18:10.755 --> 18:12.047
You don't even like Journey!

18:13.200 --> 18:14.480
I love Journey.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.673
There the Beatles of our generation.

18:20.034 --> 18:22.370
Oh come on! Who are you kidding?

18:22.852 --> 18:27.079
The only reason you put up that poster is to cover the hole Fez was using to spy on you in the shower.

18:29.218 --> 18:29.664
Okay.

18:30.028 --> 18:30.322
Fine.

18:30.828 --> 18:31.815
I think Randy is cute.

18:32.836 --> 18:34.664
But it's not a big deal. Because...

18:34.665 --> 18:36.678
I have to go. Write in your diary, I'll read it tomorrow

18:40.103 --> 18:41.030
Miss Kitty?

18:42.135 --> 18:43.180
Oh hi Fez.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.624
I'd get up, but my back's still sore from that knife you stuck in it.

18:52.703 --> 18:54.078
Listen Tutankhamen,

18:56.355 --> 18:57.494
you need to fix this.

18:58.756 --> 19:02.513
My wife has been sitting there calm and quiet all day.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.682
I disarmed landmines in Korea.

19:08.542 --> 19:12.252
But I have never been this nervous that something's about to explode.

19:18.851 --> 19:19.533
Miss Kitty?

19:22.610 --> 19:25.252
I would like to apologize for saying that you were not my mother.

19:25.939 --> 19:27.113
Why? It's the truth.

19:27.574 --> 19:29.359
Why don't you just tell me I'm fat too!

19:32.041 --> 19:34.824
See, you treated me like a son, and I didn't mean to hurt you.

19:35.931 --> 19:36.295
So,

19:36.882 --> 19:38.068
if it will fix things,

19:39.519 --> 19:40.752
I would like to take your advice

19:40.987 --> 19:42.261
and stop seeing Mrs. Sullivan.

19:44.410 --> 19:45.420
Okay look Fez.

19:45.643 --> 19:46.183
It's your life.

19:46.759 --> 19:48.339
You can do whatever you wanna do.

19:48.899 --> 19:51.652
See but the problem is, that on the one hand I want your approval

19:51.828 --> 19:52.720
and on the other

19:52.779 --> 19:55.831
I wanna be with women in ways that frankly would turn your stomach.

19:58.086 --> 19:58.473
Okay.

20:00.129 --> 20:00.951
Okay Fez.

20:02.190 --> 20:04.351
If you really see me as your mother,

20:05.462 --> 20:08.780
then you need to do what any good son would do in this situation.

20:10.682 --> 20:11.422
Lie to me.

20:16.545 --> 20:17.205
What do you mean?

20:17.590 --> 20:18.107
Okay. Well.

20:18.480 --> 20:19.614
When Eric was still here,

20:19.854 --> 20:24.545
every friday night he would tell me he was going out with his friends to the movies.

20:24.725 --> 20:27.708
But we weren't at the movies, we were drinking beer and peeing from the top of the....

20:31.789 --> 20:33.281
oooooooooh!

20:35.681 --> 20:36.925
So you see?

20:37.685 --> 20:42.359
Not telling each other what they don't wanna hear is what being a family is all about.

20:43.971 --> 20:44.887
Thank you Miss Kitty.

20:48.823 --> 20:49.751
Now if you'll excuse me,

20:50.209 --> 20:52.158
I'm going to not have sex with Mrs. Sullivan

20:52.381 --> 20:53.391
on her washing machine.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.730
You have fun at the movies!

21:04.964 --> 21:05.833
Hey Dad.

21:06.202 --> 21:08.486
I was thinking of cashing in one of my birthday coupons.

21:09.156 --> 21:11.672
I'll take you up on one free game of "Boboboply".

21:14.194 --> 21:15.004
Listen Donna,

21:15.063 --> 21:18.550
I know those are just for laughs but I wanted to get you something serious too.

21:19.061 --> 21:19.748
So here.

21:20.802 --> 21:21.671
Peanut Brittle huh?

21:23.262 --> 21:25.047
Boy, I sure do love this stuff!

21:28.057 --> 21:29.819
You didn't even see it coming!

21:31.486 --> 21:33.435
Yeah, just like last year!
