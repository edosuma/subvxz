00:00.001 --> 00:02.136
<i>Trouble at the united nations,</i>

00:02.138 --> 00:04.136
<i>where crowds of angry protestors.</i>

00:04.138 --> 00:06.438
<i>Have gathered to protest</i>
<i>a controversial speaker.</i>

00:06.440 --> 00:09.341
<i>And, no, it's not Spider-man. This time.</i>

00:23.590 --> 00:25.591
You seem a little tense, Nick.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.192
I don't like this assignment.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.460
And neither should you.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.295
For once, I agree with Fury.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.531
And, for once, I agree with Hawkeye...

00:32.533 --> 00:34.633
Agreeing with Fury.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.602
I never said I liked the assignment.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.437
But every person has the right.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.638
To speak up for his country.

00:41.241 --> 00:43.075
Even him?

00:43.077 --> 00:43.776
Even him.

00:46.179 --> 00:49.081
So, Captain America,

00:49.083 --> 00:51.450
my body guard.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.785
Playing chess alone?

00:52.787 --> 00:55.220
You can't get anyone to play with you?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.488
None that are my equal.

00:58.605 --> 01:00.283
Let's cut to the chase, Doom.

01:00.284 --> 01:03.829
You might be playing the part of
the Latverian dignitary right now,

01:03.831 --> 01:06.198
but you've never needed
a bodyguard in your life.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.499
Why are we here?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.302
An enemy, a very dangerous enemy,

01:10.304 --> 01:12.638
has placed a price on my head.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.475
Perhaps you've heard of them. The Cabal?

01:16.477 --> 01:19.244
The Skull wants you destroyed?

01:19.246 --> 01:21.146
I would have thought he would
have offered you a membership.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.315
He did. I refused.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.717
He's taken my rejection as an act of war.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.687
And declared me his number one threat.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.489
Number one threat?

01:30.491 --> 01:32.191
Skull's a dummy.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.760
You're easily number three
or four on our list.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.329
Or two. Get it?

01:37.331 --> 01:38.664
Number two.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.566
Insults?

01:40.568 --> 01:43.735
Don't you know the un is a
place for diplomacy, Stark?

01:43.737 --> 01:45.571
Don't like his style of diplomacy?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.308
Try mine.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.410
Hulk, stand down.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.744
Seriously?

01:52.746 --> 01:55.647
Doom is protected
under diplomatic immunity.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.383
Unless he does something
wrong, we can't touch him.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.052
Or we're breaking the law.

02:00.054 --> 02:02.287
Huh! Puny dictator.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.594
Does packing enough atomic firepower.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.195
To level the eastern seaboard.

02:10.197 --> 02:12.498
Count as doing something wrong?

02:12.500 --> 02:13.765
You know the deal, Doom.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.302
Have it your way.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.881
If my country is to thrive,

02:28.883 --> 02:32.451
the world must join me against
this threat of the Cabal.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.652
As Fury has so.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.420
Eloquently illustrated,

02:35.422 --> 02:37.856
un rules state, no weapons.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.791
May be allowed on the floor.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.162
Therefore, I am defenseless here,

02:43.164 --> 02:45.197
which is an invitation.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.932
For my enemies to strike.

02:46.934 --> 02:49.201
That is where you come in,

02:49.203 --> 02:50.869
Captain America.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.238
The question for you is,

02:53.240 --> 02:54.840
are you with me,

02:54.842 --> 02:56.508
or against me?

03:01.433 --> 03:06.133
Synced and corrected by masaca.

03:14.961 --> 03:16.595
Looks like a full house.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.897
Of course. They respect me.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.232
They fear you.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.967
Is that not the same thing?

03:24.604 --> 03:25.804
Hey, give me your good side.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.640
I'll show you my good side.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.676
You're supposed to be heroes!

03:30.678 --> 03:32.277
Why are you protecting him?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.579
It's a fair question, Cap.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.647
Why not just step aside
and let these people.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.616
<i>Show Doom what his fan
base really looks like.</i>

03:37.618 --> 03:39.351
Free speech, Hawkeye.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.753
If we don't protect
his right to talk today,

03:41.755 --> 03:43.822
<i>who knows, tomorrow it could be you.</i>

03:43.824 --> 03:44.957
Who says they do now?

03:44.959 --> 03:46.491
I'll give you a close-up!

03:48.595 --> 03:50.495
Mortal laws confound me.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.231
On Asgard...

03:52.233 --> 03:53.265
You probably just pound each other.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.001
With oversized weapons, right?

03:56.003 --> 03:57.836
You jest, but it works.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.575
Scans are picking up squat.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.344
<i>The most dangerous thing</i>
<i>in a two-mile radius.</i>

04:05.346 --> 04:07.246
<i>Is the metal gargoyle next to Cap.</i>

04:07.248 --> 04:09.248
Charming.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.516
It must really rust your
shorts to need our help.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.552
If the Avengers had been competent enough.

04:13.554 --> 04:15.954
To stop the Cabal in the first place,

04:15.956 --> 04:18.322
I wouldn't have to be here at all.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.958
If the Avengers are incompetent,

04:19.959 --> 04:21.927
why did you ask for us?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.930
I didn't ask for the Avengers, Captain.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.598
I asked for you.

04:31.804 --> 04:34.506
On behalf of the general
assembly, I have the

04:34.508 --> 04:37.542
honor to welcome to the united nations,

04:37.544 --> 04:40.679
the sovereign ruler of Latveria,

04:40.681 --> 04:43.715
Dr. Victor von Doom.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.791
No weapons. That was the deal.

04:55.928 --> 04:58.530
Greetings, honored delegates...

05:04.937 --> 05:07.539
A universal translator.

05:07.541 --> 05:11.543
I allow no interpreters
to mangle my words.

05:11.545 --> 05:14.479
The world faces a great threat,

05:14.481 --> 05:16.982
and as ruler of Latveria,

05:16.984 --> 05:19.084
the time has come for me to...

05:23.856 --> 05:25.057
Down! Get down!

05:25.059 --> 05:26.458
What? Who dare...

05:35.702 --> 05:36.568
Doom!

05:39.339 --> 05:43.442
The Cabal have found you
guilty of treason.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.677
This man is under the
protection of the Avengers.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.847
Then you too shall face
Hyperion's judgment.

05:49.816 --> 05:50.682
Run!

05:53.119 --> 05:54.886
Doom does not run.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.657
This is your last chance, Doom.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.959
Join the Cabal or... ah!

06:04.365 --> 06:06.698
Hyperion, the super alien.

06:06.700 --> 06:10.569
Among your many attributes,
super strength, super speed,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.004
and I believe super hearing.

06:13.006 --> 06:14.072
Run back to Skull.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.375
And tell him Doom's answer is no.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.815
Not a weapon, huh?

06:23.817 --> 06:26.151
For those of superior intellect,

06:26.153 --> 06:28.153
words are weapons.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.156
You...

06:31.158 --> 06:33.425
You'll pay for that!

06:33.427 --> 06:34.960
Hyperion, stand down...

06:34.962 --> 06:36.661
What? I said...

06:36.663 --> 06:38.163
Speak up!

06:38.165 --> 06:40.098
I said, "stand down."

06:40.100 --> 06:41.533
What?

06:43.436 --> 06:46.037
I don't know what you said, Doom,

06:46.039 --> 06:48.707
but I'm going to destroy you for it!

06:48.709 --> 06:49.608
Ugh!

07:05.591 --> 07:06.858
Don't look at me.

07:06.860 --> 07:09.060
We're busy. You wanted this assignment.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.495
Get Doom out of here.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.801
Cap to Fury. The package is safe.

07:16.502 --> 07:17.969
"Package?"

07:17.971 --> 07:19.704
"Package?"

07:19.706 --> 07:21.139
<i>What's your 20? Will send pick-up.</i>

07:21.141 --> 07:22.841
Negative. Comms may be compromised.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.010
I'll bring the package to you.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.478
Follow me.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.180
You do not order me.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.514
I am the sovereign ruler...

07:29.516 --> 07:31.516
No. You're my responsibility.

07:31.518 --> 07:32.784
You wanted me as your bodyguard.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.052
That means you do what I say.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.854
Until I have gotten you
safely out of this.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.023
Your insolence goes too far!

07:38.025 --> 07:40.225
Wrong. It can go a lot further.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.693
You want to see?

07:44.163 --> 07:46.665
Skull! I've found them!

07:47.467 --> 07:49.234
Get behind me.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.869
Doom does not cower behind
lesser men to hide from clowns!

08:00.079 --> 08:02.614
Tell Skull it will take
more than a bloated.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.550
Automaton to destroy Doom!

08:05.552 --> 08:07.118
Tell Skull yourself.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.820
When I throw your body at his feet!

08:14.628 --> 08:15.494
Huh?

08:16.829 --> 08:18.630
You red, white and blue buffoon!

08:18.632 --> 08:21.166
You should be trying
to destroy Doom as well!

08:21.168 --> 08:23.768
I don't destroy, M.O.D.O.K. I save.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.554
What? Unhand me, you troglodyte!

08:44.892 --> 08:46.791
You better go, 'cause
after I smash M.O.D.O.K.,

08:46.793 --> 08:49.895
I might just come after him.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.830
Come on. I can't tell if Hulk's joking.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.633
I cannot. I am injured.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.639
Dead end.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.240
Prepare to burn!

09:07.847 --> 09:11.216
Nowhere to run, Doom. I will see you.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.651
Plead for mercy!

09:16.622 --> 09:17.289
Ugh!

09:23.329 --> 09:25.163
Fury, change of plans.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.232
The package needs medical help. Pronto.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.767
<i>Copy. How can we assist?</i>

09:28.769 --> 09:30.135
Get the team to play defense.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.570
We're running for the end zone.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.605
Avengers tower is about 15 blocks north.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.707
We're going to have to
hoof it there to get help.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.342
You got the energy, Victor? Ugh!

09:37.344 --> 09:39.644
Avengers tower?

09:39.646 --> 09:41.746
Do you take me for a fool?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.849
You think I will willingly
walk into my enemy's lair.

09:44.851 --> 09:49.254
And have my armor
dismantled by Tony Stark?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.656
The Avengers are your only hope.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.358
I would rather be destroyed.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.194
Not what I had in mind, Doom.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.130
An undead slave would suit me better.

09:59.132 --> 10:01.967
Who addresses Doom?

10:01.969 --> 10:05.136
Trust me, Victor. You don't want to know.

10:07.174 --> 10:12.110
I have been denied your blood for
too long now, super soldier.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.721
Be glad, soldier,

10:22.723 --> 10:25.156
knowing your sacrifice gave Dracula,

10:25.158 --> 10:27.626
the King of vampires,

10:27.628 --> 10:29.394
his day in the.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.029
Sun.

10:42.174 --> 10:43.308
You...

10:43.310 --> 10:45.010
You saved my life?

10:45.012 --> 10:48.113
Don't flatter yourself, bodyguard.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.649
I still need someone
to carry me out of here.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.050
Ah, how sweet.

10:52.052 --> 10:54.419
There is no escape, mortals.

10:54.421 --> 10:58.823
For that effrontery, I shall
see you suffer for centuries!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.325
Your souls are...

11:03.263 --> 11:05.330
Was that you? Not this time.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.134
Doom, look out!

11:12.172 --> 11:15.173
Captain, your honor is most impressive,

11:15.175 --> 11:17.208
though at times it confounds me.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.076
Take your charge.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.177
And go.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.114
Ready for round two, ghoul?

11:28.287 --> 11:31.156
The norse fool has a point.

11:31.158 --> 11:32.424
Why don't you just leave me?

11:32.426 --> 11:34.693
I gave you my word.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.961
Besides, you're in no shape
to fight these guys alone.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.965
All you got is this lesser man.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.735
You dare to pity me?

11:43.737 --> 11:47.138
Even in this weakened state,
you are not my equal.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.007
I have conquered worlds,

11:49.009 --> 11:51.843
stolen the secrets of Asgard,

11:51.845 --> 11:54.345
unraveled the riddles of time and space.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.915
You are not.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.349
My equal.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.884
In the present circumstances, Victor,

11:59.886 --> 12:01.286
I'll take that as a compliment.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.056
Swell. What now?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.791
Run, swine!

12:06.793 --> 12:09.094
The Skull was a fool
to fear the likes of you.

12:09.096 --> 12:12.497
There is no escape from Attuma,

12:12.499 --> 12:14.399
war lord of Atlantis!

12:26.879 --> 12:28.046
Victor, get up!

12:28.048 --> 12:29.781
We need to get out of this water. Now!

12:32.885 --> 12:34.786
Cry for mercy, dogs!

12:34.788 --> 12:36.454
It will do you no good.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.349
Cap, where are you headed?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.818
The extraction point
was three blocks back.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.419
I'm taking him back to the tower.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.420
Are you insane?

13:10.990 --> 13:12.290
Bad enough this guy has brought.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.925
The whole Cabal down on our heads.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.860
Now you want to invite him to our home?

13:15.862 --> 13:17.028
Barton, look at him.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.168
Don't go down that way.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.070
Adaptoid and Hulk are
remodeling the subway system.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.839
We'll meet you as soon
as we can this tuna.

13:57.137 --> 13:59.470
What's so funny, Doom?

13:59.472 --> 14:02.841
There is more to you than
I first imagined, Captain.

14:02.843 --> 14:06.845
You convinced those fools to act
against their own self interests.

14:06.847 --> 14:07.612
Impressive.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.586
They trust me, Victor.

14:14.588 --> 14:16.955
Your translator know that word?

14:16.957 --> 14:19.123
It's right next to "respect."

14:19.125 --> 14:20.859
Trust?

14:20.861 --> 14:23.194
Have I not kept my word today?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.063
I told you,

14:25.065 --> 14:26.364
I was a target.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.499
I am the victim.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.903
How have I acted untrustworthy?

14:31.905 --> 14:33.271
I haven't figured that out yet.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.340
But when I do, I'll let you know.

14:35.342 --> 14:36.941
Trust me. Ugh!

14:38.377 --> 14:40.411
Hello, Doctor.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.514
It is good to finally
see you face to face.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.383
Run.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.389
You are a greater fool.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.991
Than I imagined, Doom.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.631
So you're not as injured.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.499
As you would have everyone believe.

15:02.167 --> 15:04.135
Interesting.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.504
You grim, little troll.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.539
I am Doom!

15:08.541 --> 15:10.375
Look around.

15:10.377 --> 15:13.378
In your pitiful attempt to slay me,

15:13.380 --> 15:16.247
You have exposed yourself.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.217
The world will watch as I crush you.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.352
And your useless Cabal.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.592
M.O.D.O.K?

15:31.330 --> 15:33.998
Good. Two birds, one fist!

15:39.238 --> 15:41.472
Yield, surface-dwellers!

15:41.474 --> 15:43.007
Please. Like I'm going to listen.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.342
To a walking pile of seafood.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.115
Avengers, I got eyes on Cap,

15:51.117 --> 15:52.350
and it looks like
he could use some backup.

16:00.693 --> 16:02.527
Stand and fight,

16:02.529 --> 16:04.362
foul creature of the shadows!

16:04.364 --> 16:07.598
Have respect, prince of Asgard,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.567
for you speak to a King!

16:14.073 --> 16:15.573
Get off me!

16:20.679 --> 16:22.547
Ah!

16:22.549 --> 16:24.415
Hyperion, you fool! Stop!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.286
What?

16:33.526 --> 16:37.161
Good bye, Victor,
to you and your bodyguard.

16:47.740 --> 16:49.440
What? Why?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.078
Never presume to lecture Doom.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.514
On how to earn respect.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.321
Ah!

17:05.358 --> 17:07.058
Iron man, is Doom...

17:07.060 --> 17:09.727
No, but his armor's
battery cells are depleted.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.729
His support systems are seizing up.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.431
He's got about two minutes.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.434
Go, Captain! We will hold them!

17:19.137 --> 17:22.073
Cabal! Stop him!

17:24.510 --> 17:26.444
Run fast. I only have so
many arrows, you know.

17:34.553 --> 17:36.454
Not today, robot!

17:40.325 --> 17:42.393
Tomato-face need a hug?

17:44.630 --> 17:46.230
Huh?

17:48.834 --> 17:50.368
Huh?

17:50.370 --> 17:52.103
Jarvis! Coming in hot.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.404
<i>Welcome back, Captain.</i>

17:53.406 --> 17:54.772
<i>How many for the party?</i>

17:54.774 --> 17:57.175
Where were we?

18:01.146 --> 18:02.613
Only two this time.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.594
Skull, we have the tower
defenses to the front of us,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.362
and the Avengers to the rear!

18:20.399 --> 18:22.500
Another day, Doom.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.574
And stay out!

18:32.177 --> 18:34.760
Jarvis, give me a full diagnostic report.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.782
I need to find a way to
recharge Doom's suit before...

18:37.784 --> 18:40.118
<i>Sir, I do not believe that is necessary.</i>

18:42.187 --> 18:43.855
But Tony's scanners...

18:43.857 --> 18:46.290
Fooled by superior technology.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.261
Please.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.462
Security override.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.830
Ah!

18:52.832 --> 18:55.700
All of this, a trick?

18:55.702 --> 18:57.368
Not entirely.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.303
Skull does want me dead.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.772
And, after his Cabal's recent successes.

19:01.774 --> 19:04.308
Against you and the Avengers,

19:04.310 --> 19:05.576
I knew I must do something.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.545
Or risk becoming irrelevant.

19:14.853 --> 19:17.822
I used Skull's brashness to my advantage.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.857
A risky gambit, I admit.

19:19.859 --> 19:23.628
But I had a secret weapon.
Captain America.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.296
A man who accomplishes miracles.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.899
Through sheer will alone.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.703
Now that I have these data bases,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.405
Skull will not be the only one.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.908
With Stark's pre-play algorithms.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.477
Not to mention schematics
for countless weapons,

19:39.479 --> 19:41.946
access codes to shield's computers.

19:41.948 --> 19:44.382
And sizable bank accounts.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.417
Worth the effort, wouldn't you say?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.460
Huh?

19:58.397 --> 19:59.830
Wait. Teleported?

20:03.402 --> 20:04.235
Gone.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.576
Now, Stark, let me see your mind.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.213
<i>Surprise.</i>

20:15.215 --> 20:16.214
<i>Not what you expected?</i>

20:16.216 --> 20:17.548
What?

20:17.550 --> 20:19.217
<i>Turns out Cap wasn't as knocked out.</i>

20:19.219 --> 20:20.651
<i>As he pretended to be.</i>

20:20.653 --> 20:23.854
<i>When you so spryly fought back Skull,</i>

20:23.856 --> 20:25.756
<i>he guessed what you were playing at.</i>

20:25.758 --> 20:27.258
<i>I signaled Tony.</i>

20:27.260 --> 20:27.258
<i>It allowed him time to install.</i>

20:27.260 --> 20:30.528
<i>A trojan horse program</i>
<i>into the data banks.</i>

20:30.530 --> 20:32.396
Risky.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.832
You could simply have not
brought me into your tower.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.934
<i>You were still under diplomatic immunity.</i>

20:36.936 --> 20:36.934
<i>I had no proof.</i>

20:36.936 --> 20:41.906
<i>The best part, when you fled
the country with my property,</i>

20:41.908 --> 20:44.242
<i>you violated international law.</i>

20:44.244 --> 20:46.410
<i>Your immunity? Gone.</i>

20:46.412 --> 20:49.547
<i>You ever set foot</i>
<i>outside of Latveria again,</i>

20:49.549 --> 20:50.948
<i>you'll be under arrest.</i>

20:50.950 --> 20:53.251
<i>And I'll be the one standing there.</i>

20:53.253 --> 20:54.518
<i>Trust me.</i>

20:55.787 --> 20:57.288
What?

21:00.559 --> 21:01.826
No!

21:01.828 --> 21:03.861
No!

21:04.529 --> 21:05.963
<i>No!</i>

21:05.965 --> 21:08.299
That is a nasty piece of malware.

21:08.301 --> 21:10.368
It'll keep his power grid
offline for weeks.

21:10.370 --> 21:12.403
Doom will not be happy.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.272
Excellent.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.307
Couldn't we have just punched him?

21:16.309 --> 21:19.644
No, Hulk. We couldn't make our
move until he revealed himself,

21:19.646 --> 21:22.413
or we would've been the ones
on the wrong side of the law.

21:22.415 --> 21:25.449
Remind me to never
get on your bad side, Cap.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.751
What are you talking about, Hawkeye?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.519
Don't you know? I'm the good guy.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.521
I don't have a bad side.
