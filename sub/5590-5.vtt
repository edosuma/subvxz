36:08.155 --> 36:09.020
I'll see you tomorrow.

36:12.457 --> 36:13.823
Great night.

36:13.825 --> 36:16.659
I'm assuming you and luke
are closing deals tomorrow?

36:16.661 --> 36:18.160
More than likely.

36:18.162 --> 36:19.928
[ sighs ]

36:19.930 --> 36:23.431
I don't know how much clearer
I can make this --

36:23.433 --> 36:24.532
I'm your guy.

36:26.102 --> 36:28.569
I worked for warren buffett
straight out of college.

36:28.571 --> 36:30.671
I put myself through
harvard business school.

36:30.673 --> 36:33.273
I re-branded the l.A. Forum
for top-of-the-line performers.

36:33.275 --> 36:35.141
Clive davis --
you know clive davis?

36:35.143 --> 36:36.775
[ chuckles ]
yeah, well,
he was so impressed

36:36.777 --> 36:38.843
That he brought me on
to do a&r for him.

36:38.845 --> 36:40.578
I was a c.E.O.
At edgehill,

36:40.580 --> 36:43.581
And after the label folded
because of corporate downsizing,

36:43.583 --> 36:45.416
I reinvented myself
as a manager

36:45.418 --> 36:47.351
To a very difficult
but very successful star.

36:47.353 --> 36:49.186
And I have a great relationship
with your boss,

36:49.188 --> 36:50.587
So I don't see a scenario

36:50.589 --> 36:52.522
Where I am<i> not</i> the guy
for the job.

36:52.524 --> 36:55.324
You<i> were</i> at the top
of my list.

36:55.326 --> 36:57.759
But luke took you off.

36:57.761 --> 36:59.794
I<i> could</i> make a case
for you now,

36:59.796 --> 37:01.629
But as often
as you've blurred the lines

37:01.631 --> 37:02.997
Between business
and pleasure...

37:02.999 --> 37:04.031
Oh, come on.

37:04.033 --> 37:05.098
...I'm concerned.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.866
What,
I'm not allowed to date?

37:06.868 --> 37:09.368
You put layla on the red carpet
at juliette's premiere.

37:09.370 --> 37:11.103
You're using luke's events
tomorrow

37:11.105 --> 37:12.871
To get her in front
of important people.

37:12.873 --> 37:14.105
That's not what I'm doing.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.540
Can you draw the line
when you need to?

37:16.542 --> 37:18.642
Absolutely.

37:18.644 --> 37:20.777
The job comes first.

37:20.779 --> 37:22.945
I'd love to see you
prove that.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.623
How was that?

37:35.625 --> 37:37.558
How was what?

37:37.560 --> 37:39.693
We've only had
about a million conversations

37:39.695 --> 37:41.861
About you getting up onstage
and performing.

37:41.863 --> 37:42.862
I've performed
with<i> you</i> before.

37:42.864 --> 37:45.130
That's right --
with permission.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.898
Not with juliette barnes.

37:46.900 --> 37:49.467
Not strutting yourself
up in front of 20,000 people.

37:49.469 --> 37:50.134
That's what<i> you</i> do!

37:50.136 --> 37:51.668
I'm an adult, maddie.

37:51.670 --> 37:53.870
So am I!
No, you're not!

37:53.872 --> 37:56.072
You're 16 years old!

37:56.074 --> 37:58.307
And juliette barnes
is not a role model.

37:58.309 --> 38:01.009
Juliette is awesome.
She gets me.

38:01.011 --> 38:03.478
She just gave me
<i> the</i> best night of my life!

38:03.480 --> 38:06.380
You're just pissed because
you're not as cool as she is!

38:06.382 --> 38:08.348
Okay, well,
if you think that's cool,

38:08.350 --> 38:10.149
Then we have
much bigger problems

38:10.151 --> 38:12.818
Than you getting up
on that stage tonight.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.253
Girl, you've got
so much growing up to do,

38:15.255 --> 38:18.622
And I'm telling you right now,
I'm gonna be making the rules.

38:20.692 --> 38:21.757
[ sighs ]

38:24.528 --> 38:26.094
Luke?
You got a second?

38:26.096 --> 38:28.329
Yeah. Um, why don't you
go on up to bed?

38:28.331 --> 38:30.230
I'm gonna talk a little
business, then I'll head up.

38:30.232 --> 38:31.097
Right.

38:33.067 --> 38:35.167
[ chuckles ] it looks like
we are going to have

38:35.169 --> 38:36.701
Quite the party tomorrow.

38:36.703 --> 38:38.102
Both coke<i> and</i> ford
are on board.

38:38.104 --> 38:39.169
Hey!

38:39.171 --> 38:40.503
[ both laugh ]

38:43.441 --> 38:44.740
[ chuckles ]

38:44.742 --> 38:47.075
Almost like
we planned it, huh?

38:47.077 --> 38:48.042
[ both chuckle ]

38:48.044 --> 38:50.077
You maybe wanna...

38:50.079 --> 38:51.745
Have a drink with me
to celebrate?

38:51.747 --> 38:54.114
There's business,
there's pleasure.

38:54.116 --> 38:56.182
I-I don't mix the two.

38:56.184 --> 38:57.716
Okay. Not even tempted.
Got it.

38:57.718 --> 39:02.087
I didn't say
I wasn't tempted.

39:02.089 --> 39:03.354
Good night.

39:11.464 --> 39:13.263
How you feeling?

39:13.265 --> 39:14.697
Like crap.

39:16.133 --> 39:17.899
Take it
from somebody that knows.

39:17.901 --> 39:18.766
[ sighs ]

39:18.768 --> 39:21.068
You want to drink water.

39:21.070 --> 39:22.803
Lots of it.

39:22.805 --> 39:26.439
Listen, I need
to tell you something.

39:26.441 --> 39:28.840
I know
that what you did...

39:31.477 --> 39:32.943
...It wasn't easy.

39:32.945 --> 39:35.946
And I was wrong
to make out like it was.

39:35.948 --> 39:38.648
I was just hanging on
to the smallest possible hope,

39:38.650 --> 39:41.417
You know, but...

39:41.419 --> 39:44.553
You knew -- you knew
that...Even if she survived

39:44.555 --> 39:48.289
That...She wouldn't --
she wouldn't be living.

39:50.626 --> 39:52.926
God, she'd hate that.

39:52.928 --> 39:55.128
I think you made
the right decision.

39:57.832 --> 39:59.331
I do.

40:06.072 --> 40:09.106
I'm just sorry I wasn't strong
enough to make it with you.

40:09.108 --> 40:10.974
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

40:19.683 --> 40:21.516
[ sighing ] I'm sorry.

40:26.188 --> 40:27.687
Avery. Thank god.

40:29.957 --> 40:31.623
What are you doing here?

40:31.625 --> 40:32.924
Is cadence okay?

40:32.926 --> 40:36.027
I had no idea that she was sick.
Believe me.

40:36.029 --> 40:38.829
I didn't even know
that you called until tonight.

40:38.831 --> 40:41.698
I didn't. I was just on my way
to fly to nashville.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.133
You know, for months,

40:44.135 --> 40:46.935
All I wanted was for you
to reach out to me.

40:46.937 --> 40:48.603
To us.

40:48.605 --> 40:51.973
Just a call or a text.

40:51.975 --> 40:53.774
I did text you.
Mm-hmm.

40:53.776 --> 40:56.510
Today.

40:56.512 --> 40:58.211
And if you'd done it
yesterday,

40:58.213 --> 41:00.313
Then maybe this conversation
would be different,

41:00.315 --> 41:02.581
But after what happened
to cadence...

41:04.151 --> 41:05.717
She could have died.

41:05.719 --> 41:07.452
I didn't know.
I was completely out of it.

41:07.454 --> 41:08.619
Okay,
so best-case scenario,

41:08.621 --> 41:10.053
You were so messed up
on drugs,

41:10.055 --> 41:11.654
You had no idea
what was happening,

41:11.656 --> 41:12.988
Because
you've surrounded yourself

41:12.990 --> 41:14.556
With people
who don't tell you the truth.

41:14.558 --> 41:16.624
I know that,
and I am making a change.

41:16.626 --> 41:17.825
It's too late.

41:17.827 --> 41:19.193
No.

41:19.195 --> 41:21.562
No, it's<i> not</i> too late.
What are you talking about?

41:21.564 --> 41:23.864
It's not --
I want a divorce.

41:25.567 --> 41:28.301
I'm gonna file the paperwork
in a different county,

41:28.303 --> 41:31.137
Using our middle names.

41:31.139 --> 41:33.139
You can break the news
however you want.

41:33.141 --> 41:36.675
You can protect
this perfect public image

41:36.677 --> 41:38.743
You've worked so hard
to create.

41:38.745 --> 41:41.812
In exchange...

41:41.814 --> 41:44.747
I want you to sign a termination
of parental rights.

41:46.751 --> 41:49.184
I will have sole custody,

41:49.186 --> 41:51.385
And cadence
will just be my daughter.

41:53.188 --> 41:55.655
I can't have her grow up

41:55.657 --> 41:57.657
Thinking that she can depend
on her mother

41:57.659 --> 42:00.292
When we both know
that she can't.

42:02.729 --> 42:04.061
This is
my lawyer's number.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.728
You can call him
with your response.

42:07.898 --> 42:10.064
You have 24 hours.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.633
Goodbye, juliette.
