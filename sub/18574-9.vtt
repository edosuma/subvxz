WEBVTT

00:18.905 --> 00:21.834
Don't let us down now, Valkyrie.

00:22.681 --> 00:25.766
Fingers crossed, Alan.
I got everything crossed.

00:26.117 --> 00:31.677
OK, people. Transmission arriving
in...

00:32.530 --> 00:38.131
..ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

00:38.545 --> 00:44.076
Five, four, three, two, one!

00:45.079 --> 00:46.468
Sorry, I could never resist
a countdown!

00:46.515 --> 00:49.354
Who the hell are you?!
Is this Neil Armstrong?

00:49.600 --> 00:50.694
What?

00:50.742 --> 00:53.358
Neil Armstrong?
First man on the Moon.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.217
Not quite the first...

00:55.265 --> 00:57.052
You mean he wasn't the first man
on the Moon?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.125
That is such a human-centric
question.

00:59.173 --> 01:00.967
I'm the human in this set up.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.240
She is, actually.

01:02.308 --> 01:04.239
It's a bit embarrassing, really.

01:04.739 --> 01:06.668
Who are you people?

01:06.719 --> 01:10.599
Friendly aliens. Don't mind us,
just a day out for the kids.

01:12.744 --> 01:13.814
It's from the Chief!

01:13.862 --> 01:15.315
Is it? Oh, yes. That's right.

01:15.468 --> 01:19.815
Authorising us to go anywhere
we please. So - Valkyrie?

01:20.083 --> 01:22.299
Valkyrie... is...

01:23.801 --> 01:27.680
..probing the Martian ice caps with
a new kind of camera on board.

01:27.798 --> 01:30.205
Uses a different spectrum

01:30.253 --> 01:35.120
to see under the poles
and beam back pictures.

01:41.212 --> 01:43.830
What the hell...?

02:16.625 --> 02:20.474
<font color=#FF00FF>*DOCTOR WHO</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 10 Episode 09</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Empress of Mars"</font>

02:40.354 --> 02:43.394
Mars. 1881. Or thereabouts.

02:43.581 --> 02:45.995
According to the TARDIS,
that's when the message was made.

02:46.087 --> 02:47.792
Though we may be a bit early.

02:47.855 --> 02:50.175
So, there were humans on Mars in
Victorian times?

02:50.225 --> 02:51.519
No.

02:52.167 --> 02:53.597
There weren't.

02:54.253 --> 02:58.542
The TARDIS registered multiple life
forms below the surface,

02:58.730 --> 03:00.948
so this seems like
the best place to look.

03:01.284 --> 03:04.808
Maybe someone's been messing around
with time. Like in The Terminator.

03:04.911 --> 03:06.019
The Terminator?

03:06.091 --> 03:08.237
It's a movie. You haven't seen it?

03:08.307 --> 03:09.786
I'm a very busy man.

03:09.881 --> 03:12.448
You'd like it.
It's got killer robots.

03:12.628 --> 03:14.331
Ooh, I'll put it on the list.

03:15.211 --> 03:18.156
Even if there are people here,
why would they bother writing

03:18.270 --> 03:19.843
messages on the surface of
the planet?

03:19.891 --> 03:21.937
State visit? Patriotic fervour?

03:22.776 --> 03:24.703
Rogue graffiti artist?

03:26.857 --> 03:28.437
Doctor...

03:31.020 --> 03:32.660
I see it.

03:45.623 --> 03:48.263
If there's fire,
there's got to be oxygen!

03:48.311 --> 03:49.787
Wait, wait! Let's not be rash.

03:49.835 --> 03:51.755
- OK.
- I'll go first.

03:53.621 --> 03:54.940
What are you doing?!

03:55.058 --> 03:57.578
Fire. Oxygen.
Basic physics, isn't it?

03:58.837 --> 04:00.716
Could've been basic death!

04:03.247 --> 04:05.084
Wait, how can there be oxygen here?

04:07.089 --> 04:10.091
The indigenous Martians were
superb engineers.

04:11.441 --> 04:14.040
Mind you, there's a lot here
that doesn't make sense.

04:14.455 --> 04:17.107
It's like the underground tunnels
in The Thing.

04:17.927 --> 04:19.115
The what?

04:19.190 --> 04:22.990
It's a movie. You'd like that one
too. Everybody dies.

04:31.959 --> 04:34.248
Bill? Bill?

04:34.982 --> 04:37.263
Bill! Bill!

04:37.615 --> 04:40.146
Hang on! We'll find a way down!

04:40.763 --> 04:43.427
Go back to the TARDIS!
Get ropes. Lifting gear.

04:43.475 --> 04:44.505
Anything you can find!

05:13.221 --> 05:15.814
Nardole, what the hell are
you doing?

06:02.654 --> 06:06.811
So this could
go very well or very badly.

06:29.275 --> 06:30.901
Halt!

06:32.691 --> 06:36.518
I say! We weren't expecting company!

06:38.751 --> 06:40.143
Right.

06:44.452 --> 06:46.499
Er... Yeah.

06:50.445 --> 06:51.977
Right.

06:59.772 --> 07:04.396
By the moons, I honour thee.
I am the Doctor.

07:04.826 --> 07:06.240
What is your name?

07:08.646 --> 07:09.880
I know your people of old.

07:09.928 --> 07:14.045
I was once... an Honorary Guardian of
the Tythonian Hive.

07:15.933 --> 07:18.443
Don't move.
I'll sort this beggar out.

07:18.491 --> 07:20.553
No, no, no, no!
You don't understand!

07:20.756 --> 07:23.475
This creature is no threat!
He may look like a monster to you...

07:23.601 --> 07:25.029
GUNSHOT

07:25.121 --> 07:26.568
I wasn't talking to you.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.717
Are you all right, Friday?

07:30.951 --> 07:32.190
Sir.

07:32.603 --> 07:34.599
Who are you and what the devil
are you doing here?

07:34.666 --> 07:37.459
I could ask you the same question.
And I will!

08:01.937 --> 08:03.137
Hello.

08:03.596 --> 08:05.257
Hello, Miss?

08:05.510 --> 08:07.757
I was wondering if I could
ask for your help?

08:08.067 --> 08:09.468
I need to get to Mars.

08:09.542 --> 08:12.301
Well, I need to get back to Mars,
in fact.

08:12.390 --> 08:16.914
Um... and... it's a little bit urgent,
only the TARDIS is acting up.

08:17.093 --> 08:19.570
I was wondering if you could
tell me how to fix...

08:19.638 --> 08:21.062
'Course I can.'

08:21.625 --> 08:25.218
Oh, right. Thank you.

08:25.406 --> 08:27.833
'But it's probably easier if
I just show you.'

08:28.182 --> 08:30.263
Oh. Erm...

08:33.293 --> 08:34.972
Indian or China, m'dear?

08:36.238 --> 08:42.013
Erm. I... I dunno. China?

08:45.333 --> 08:47.411
Where's Nardole?

08:49.489 --> 08:52.825
Erm... He seems to have taken
the TARDIS.

08:52.896 --> 08:56.700
- What?!
- I'm sure it's only a temporary thing

08:56.816 --> 09:02.622
but it means that for the time
being, we're stuck here on Mars.

09:02.755 --> 09:04.083
You were saying, Colonel?

09:04.185 --> 09:08.450
Oh, well, yes, I was stationed
out there. South Africa.

09:08.622 --> 09:11.521
One day, I came across
something in the veldt.

09:11.603 --> 09:14.402
Something that was clearly not of
this earth.

09:14.544 --> 09:16.638
An interplanetary vessel!

09:17.138 --> 09:20.880
I found Friday here on board.
In a sort of coma.

09:21.036 --> 09:22.403
Half dead.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.357
Why do you call him that?

09:24.692 --> 09:28.262
Man Friday? As in Robinson Crusoe?

09:29.903 --> 09:37.138
So, according to this you've been on
board Friday's ship the whole time?

09:37.247 --> 09:42.029
Yes. We were...
That sounds... That sounds...

09:42.184 --> 09:43.661
Convincing?

09:43.833 --> 09:46.919
Yes, that's right. On his ship.

09:49.771 --> 09:52.255
Well, I suppose it was pretty roomy,
what!

09:52.653 --> 09:53.694
Yes!

09:54.858 --> 09:56.919
- It was! Yes. Wasn't it?
- Yes.

09:56.967 --> 09:58.286
Very roomy.

09:58.567 --> 10:03.052
But the whole, you know, getting
on board... I mean, that's all...

10:03.732 --> 10:08.466
It's all a bit hazy.
Maybe you could tell us everything.

10:08.653 --> 10:14.278
Yes, well... after I woke him up,
Friday asked for my help.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.810
To repair his spaceship?

10:15.911 --> 10:19.747
- Yes. And to bring him home.
- In return for what?

10:19.783 --> 10:24.700
Ah. Well, now. That is the question.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.474
BOOM

10:26.642 --> 10:31.201
- Prepare to fire!
- At the double!

10:31.412 --> 10:33.039
Go, go, go!

10:33.087 --> 10:37.258
'Friday helped us build the
Gargantua, a remarkable piece

10:37.306 --> 10:40.461
'of mining equipment fashioned from
one of his ship's artillery.'

10:47.987 --> 10:52.120
'He promised us gemstones,
you see, silver... gold...

10:52.256 --> 10:55.034
'Treasure beyond our wildest
dreams.'

10:55.198 --> 10:57.080
That's why you helped him come home.

10:59.674 --> 11:02.229
To claim Mars in the name of
Queen Victoria.

11:02.448 --> 11:05.362
To loot it of its riches.
Stake a claim.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.666
The red planet turned pink.

11:07.869 --> 11:10.182
That was the general idea, old love.

11:10.885 --> 11:12.377
But there's nothing here.

11:12.947 --> 11:16.963
Whole show's been a ruddy wash out.
The ship crashed on landing.

11:17.213 --> 11:20.846
I go top side now and then to see if
I can repair the beggar.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.112
That's what I was doing
when I ran across you.

11:24.638 --> 11:27.588
- And?
- No joy so far.

11:27.689 --> 11:30.877
It could have been a fresh start.
For all of us.

11:31.308 --> 11:35.291
But now supplies are running as
low as morale.

11:36.142 --> 11:38.462
Things are pretty desperate,
I'm afraid.

11:40.076 --> 11:41.869
RINGING

11:43.251 --> 11:45.891
THUDDING FOOTSTEPS

11:53.899 --> 11:56.218
You've told us why you came here.

11:56.329 --> 11:58.048
What does he get out of it?

11:58.974 --> 12:01.791
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

12:02.030 --> 12:03.470
He was hoping to find his people.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.626
But it appears he was asleep
on that ship

12:05.680 --> 12:07.525
much longer than he anticipated.

12:08.330 --> 12:11.845
Mars is dead. Dead as a coffin nail.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.119
Friday is the last of his kind.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.783
Is he now?

12:18.829 --> 12:20.610
You know what Friday is then?

12:20.900 --> 12:22.579
He's an Ice Warrior.

12:23.001 --> 12:26.259
And they're the proper Martians
right? They belong here?

12:26.471 --> 12:31.009
Yes. The indigenous species.
An ancient reptilian race.

12:31.057 --> 12:34.509
They built themselves a sort of
bio-mechanical armour for protection.

12:34.557 --> 12:38.156
The creature within... is at one
with its carapace.

12:38.900 --> 12:43.298
The Ice Warriors, they could build
a city under the sand

12:43.764 --> 12:48.040
yet drench the snows of Mars
with innocent blood.

12:48.609 --> 12:51.228
They could slaughter
whole civilisations,

12:51.323 --> 12:53.931
yet weep at the crushing of
a flower.

12:55.587 --> 12:57.721
Like The Vikings.

12:59.438 --> 13:02.892
Yes. Yes, very much.

13:02.940 --> 13:07.970
Yeah, Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis!
The theme tune is amazing!

13:08.141 --> 13:11.470
There's this brilliant bit
where his eye gets gouged out...

13:22.951 --> 13:24.871
Why have you really come back?

13:27.333 --> 13:32.192
I am old and tired and spent.

13:48.131 --> 13:50.412
Now then, Vincey.
Look lively, lad.

13:50.522 --> 13:51.569
What's the point, though?

13:51.617 --> 13:52.819
Jackdaw...

13:52.867 --> 13:56.131
Months we've been digging 'ere and
what have we got to show for it?

13:56.254 --> 13:58.108
Sweet Fanny Adams, that's what.

13:58.270 --> 13:59.631
Yeah!

13:59.803 --> 14:02.678
What old Friday promised,
it's a load of gammon!

14:06.453 --> 14:07.960
- Jackdaw...
- What...?

14:36.157 --> 14:39.227
You must come at once, sir.
The Gargantua!

14:39.516 --> 14:42.710
She's... She's uncovered something!

14:46.190 --> 14:47.710
Good Lord!

14:50.049 --> 14:53.025
Looks like old Friday
came good after all, eh?

14:54.305 --> 14:57.750
It's beautiful. What is it?

14:57.830 --> 14:59.150
A tomb?

15:00.310 --> 15:02.185
Not just any tomb.

15:04.910 --> 15:07.081
This is the tomb of an Ice Queen.

15:09.349 --> 15:11.529
I have a bad feeling about this.

15:14.623 --> 15:20.404
These sarcophagi were sometimes part
of a complex hibernation system.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.724
Sergeant Major, get these civilians
out of here.

15:22.778 --> 15:26.068
No! Colonel, colonel,
you have to let me examine this.

15:26.224 --> 15:29.615
I think not, Doctor.
This is a military matter.

15:29.710 --> 15:32.309
This may not just be
a grave you've uncovered.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.702
This could be the entrance to an
Ice Warrior Hive.

15:36.115 --> 15:38.795
A what? Sergeant Major Peach!
I gave you an order...

15:38.859 --> 15:40.498
I am in charge here, Catchlove!

15:40.815 --> 15:43.402
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

15:43.737 --> 15:44.826
Post a guard.

15:44.874 --> 15:46.871
No-one is to go near this thing until
the morning, is that clear?

15:46.918 --> 15:48.246
Yes, sir!

15:50.975 --> 15:53.559
The last thing I'm going to do
is take sides.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.168
But isn't it obvious?
Friday has been using you all along.

15:58.699 --> 16:01.590
His aim was to get back to Mars and
find his Queen.

16:01.673 --> 16:04.676
Nonsense! He was leading us to the
riches he promised us.

16:04.835 --> 16:07.074
The simple fact is,
you don't belong here.

16:07.190 --> 16:09.207
The sooner you get off this
planet, the better!

16:09.310 --> 16:16.811
Don't belong?! We're British!
Mars is part of the empire now.

16:30.218 --> 16:32.097
What happened to not taking sides?

16:32.530 --> 16:34.452
I'm trying to save their lives!

16:34.718 --> 16:37.819
Let's face it, in this scenario,
the humans are the invaders.

16:37.917 --> 16:41.276
On the other hand, the Ice Warriors
have vastly superior armaments

16:41.354 --> 16:43.296
which will wipe the humans out.

16:43.647 --> 16:45.163
So what am I supposed to do?

16:47.771 --> 16:49.371
Here you go, Sarge.

16:51.816 --> 16:54.935
- Much obliged, I'm sure, Jackdaw.
- Don't I get none?

16:55.620 --> 16:58.150
- RHIP, son.
- Eh?

16:59.949 --> 17:01.949
Rank has its privileges.

17:04.390 --> 17:08.453
Christ alive,
look at the gild on that thing!

17:10.240 --> 17:12.811
That would set a fella up for life,
Vincey.

17:13.070 --> 17:15.242
Even just a little bit of it.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.102
Now then, you 'orrible old man,

17:20.440 --> 17:23.125
don't go getting no fancy notions.

17:23.383 --> 17:26.250
I'm sure the colonel will be
distributing this munificence

17:26.332 --> 17:29.250
in a fair and decent fashion,

17:29.408 --> 17:31.969
and we can all look forward to...

17:33.227 --> 17:34.829
to a...

17:35.200 --> 17:37.080
a rosy...

17:37.282 --> 17:38.681
..future...

17:38.870 --> 17:40.230
Sarge?!

17:41.615 --> 17:43.494
Jackdaw! What have you done?

17:43.596 --> 17:45.461
A quietner from the infirmary.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.922
He'll be as right as ninepence
come dawn.

17:48.193 --> 17:50.422
But by then, I'll be gone. Gone?

17:50.571 --> 17:51.852
Gone where?

17:51.938 --> 17:54.875
Case you've forgotten,
we're marooned on ruddy Mars!

17:55.258 --> 17:57.579
You don't know what I know, son.

17:58.141 --> 18:01.981
Captain Catchlove's further on
with his repairs than he's let on.

18:02.256 --> 18:05.724
Oh, yes, my old love,
Jackdaw's going home,

18:05.849 --> 18:08.630
but this time, he'll be minted!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.677
Come on. Give us a hand.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.350
Right!

18:17.165 --> 18:18.368
Keep an eye out, will you?

18:18.432 --> 18:21.299
Nah, you ain't getting me
involved in this lark, Jackdaw!

18:21.676 --> 18:23.705
Go on! Be a sport!

18:24.080 --> 18:27.557
You'll get your share
of the rhino, I promise!

18:57.738 --> 19:01.004
♪ It's the same
the whole world over... ♪

19:06.218 --> 19:09.897
♪ ..It's the poor what gets the
blame... ♪

19:15.710 --> 19:20.190
♪ ..It's the rich
what gets the pleasure

19:23.799 --> 19:27.078
♪ Ain't it all a bleedin' shame! ♪

19:57.510 --> 19:59.269
Someone's coming, Jackdaw!

19:59.629 --> 20:01.349
We'll ruddy swing for this!

20:05.159 --> 20:06.479
Jackdaw!

20:07.659 --> 20:10.111
Come on, mate. Don't muck about...

20:12.486 --> 20:13.966
Jackdaw?

20:14.547 --> 20:19.346
What manner of fleshy worm are you?

20:23.167 --> 20:26.408
SLOW, HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

20:38.236 --> 20:39.657
Speak.

20:43.104 --> 20:44.543
What the hell...?

20:47.242 --> 20:50.563
That was... unwise.

21:02.267 --> 21:04.454
Your Majesty.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.251
By the moons,
I honour thee, Iraxxa.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.259
My Empress! My Queen!

21:15.403 --> 21:16.790
My Sentinel.

21:16.955 --> 21:19.474
You have fulfilled your pledge.

21:19.670 --> 21:22.789
I am resurrected!

21:22.993 --> 21:24.470
Forgive me, Majesty,

21:24.550 --> 21:28.337
but we have slept longer
than anticipated.

21:28.586 --> 21:31.149
By my calculations, Majesty,

21:31.337 --> 21:35.024
we have slept for 5,000 years.

21:35.280 --> 21:38.548
5,000 years?

21:38.813 --> 21:41.587
Jump to it! Move!

21:48.363 --> 21:50.825
What the devil? What the hell's
going on here, Friday?

21:50.887 --> 21:53.009
Colonel, let me speak to them.
I can do this. I can sort this out.

21:53.056 --> 21:54.443
Who the devil is this?

21:54.521 --> 21:56.396
She is Iraxxa,

21:56.444 --> 21:58.323
Empress of Mars.

21:58.430 --> 22:01.653
The deuce she is! And you think
you can just go about

22:01.716 --> 22:04.068
slaughtering my men willy-nilly,
do you, madam?

22:04.185 --> 22:05.384
"Your men"?

22:05.503 --> 22:08.036
What does the pink thing say?

22:08.148 --> 22:09.507
Pink thing?!

22:09.743 --> 22:11.630
Sergeant Major, call to arms!

22:11.678 --> 22:13.717
No! No! Wait, Catchlove! Wait!

22:13.765 --> 22:17.669
Honour must be satisfied. An eye
for an eye! I am in command here!

22:19.883 --> 22:21.283
All right.

22:31.414 --> 22:33.180
By the moons, I honour thee.

22:34.590 --> 22:36.102
I'm the Doctor...

22:36.808 --> 22:38.367
..and I beg leave to intercede.

22:38.642 --> 22:42.180
- You know my race?
- I do.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.659
And I ask... mercy for these
primitives.

22:46.770 --> 22:49.078
- "Primitives"?!
- Shhhh!

22:52.950 --> 22:56.680
Majesty, the world you knew is dead.

22:58.031 --> 23:00.561
The atmosphere has all
but evaporated.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.480
The surface is lifeless.

23:03.724 --> 23:06.633
If there are others who sleep here,

23:06.882 --> 23:09.617
they cannot survive
on Mars without help.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.985
You must cooperate
if you are to survive.

23:13.132 --> 23:15.451
He speaks the truth, Majesty.

23:15.781 --> 23:21.391
The war, all that we fought for,
is less than the dust now.

23:24.317 --> 23:25.876
And you!

23:26.190 --> 23:27.750
Female.

23:29.301 --> 23:31.020
What do you say?

23:31.310 --> 23:32.394
Me?

23:32.484 --> 23:37.558
We are both surrounded
by... noisy males.

23:38.575 --> 23:41.814
I would value your opinion.

23:42.042 --> 23:44.675
Yeah, yeah, yeah, er...

23:50.770 --> 23:52.250
They're not lying to you.

23:53.653 --> 23:56.364
There's no need for anyone else
to die today.

23:57.294 --> 23:58.911
The humans saved his life.

23:59.150 --> 24:00.520
Is this true?

24:00.719 --> 24:03.262
His cryogenic cell was damaged.
They saved him.

24:03.425 --> 24:06.364
And made him their pet!

24:06.590 --> 24:09.762
It was necessary
to dissemble, Majesty.

24:09.858 --> 24:12.325
I thought only of your resurrection.

24:12.449 --> 24:14.731
It was a tactical decision...

24:14.868 --> 24:17.848
An Ice Warrior's duty is to command!

24:17.910 --> 24:19.059
Present!

24:20.653 --> 24:22.669
Iraxxa, listen to me!

24:23.365 --> 24:25.395
The Mars you ruled is gone!

24:25.510 --> 24:27.294
But don't let it end this way!

24:27.856 --> 24:29.942
Fight, yes,

24:30.145 --> 24:31.715
but for the future.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.809
Not a dead past.

24:39.287 --> 24:41.590
- You bloody fool!
- Sorry, sir!

24:41.753 --> 24:44.497
Down! Put your gun down. Halt!

24:44.878 --> 24:47.958
Your Majesty, are you all right?

24:48.995 --> 24:52.074
You ask for mercy
for these creatures?

24:52.458 --> 24:53.778
Indeed.

24:54.967 --> 24:56.606
Then I grant it.

24:56.740 --> 24:58.180
Thank you.

25:03.169 --> 25:05.333
They will die...

25:05.914 --> 25:07.554
quickly.

25:08.444 --> 25:11.208
No-o-o-o! Colonel!
Get your men out of here!

25:11.380 --> 25:13.840
Colonel!

25:15.276 --> 25:16.595
Colonel!

25:16.674 --> 25:18.778
Retreat! RETREAT!

25:21.897 --> 25:24.749
Catchlove, listen to me! Your only
chance is to come to terms.

25:24.797 --> 25:27.499
We have the Gargantua! Is she primed
and aimed, Sergeant?

25:27.547 --> 25:28.273
Yes, sir!

25:28.321 --> 25:30.313
No, no, I forbid you, that is not
a weapon!

25:30.453 --> 25:32.109
"Forbid"? You forbid

25:32.196 --> 25:33.922
This farce has gone on long enough!

25:33.987 --> 25:35.680
Arms at the ready!

25:36.286 --> 25:38.085
MACHINERY CLANKS

25:38.134 --> 25:40.602
No! No! Don't shoot! For God's sake.

25:40.750 --> 25:43.610
Down! Put your guns down!

25:44.430 --> 25:46.313
What the devil?

25:46.361 --> 25:48.680
BLASTER SHOT, RUMBLING

25:52.539 --> 25:53.961
That will hold them!

26:12.634 --> 26:15.875
We're about to go to war,
so it's time you knew the truth.

26:16.190 --> 26:17.719
Listen to me, men!

26:18.320 --> 26:21.719
The colonel is not what he appears!

26:22.260 --> 26:24.493
The hero of Isandlwana

26:25.305 --> 26:27.297
- Show them your famous wound, Colonel.
- No, no. No, please!

26:27.344 --> 26:29.860
- No, please...
- Show them! FABRIC RIPS

26:30.892 --> 26:32.336
The mark of a rope!

26:32.563 --> 26:34.522
While you were fighting
for Queen and country,

26:34.750 --> 26:38.040
the colonel here was dancing
the Newgate polka!

26:38.136 --> 26:45.157
This is the mark of the rope that
failed to hang him for desertion!

26:46.269 --> 26:48.907
They tried to hang him,
but they bungled it.

26:49.007 --> 26:52.124
He's a paper tiger.
Not fit to command!

26:52.269 --> 26:55.068
Look, it doesn't matter who's in
charge of your stupid expedition!

26:55.671 --> 26:57.944
You don't stand a chance against
the Ice Warriors!

26:57.992 --> 27:00.551
- What, all two of 'em?
- There'll be more, you idiot!

27:00.710 --> 27:02.351
The Hive is active.

27:02.569 --> 27:06.422
Don't you see? They'll do anything
to defend their home planet.

27:06.804 --> 27:09.413
Well, I dare say the British Army

27:09.561 --> 27:12.858
is more than a match for
a bunch of upright crocodiles.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.358
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir?

27:14.406 --> 27:15.819
I'm assuming command.

27:16.038 --> 27:18.093
Take the colonel
and put him in the brig.

27:18.761 --> 27:21.069
Sergeant Major Peach,
I gave you an order.

27:21.226 --> 27:23.069
Very good, sir.

27:23.311 --> 27:24.710
Private!

27:39.657 --> 27:42.580
If you'd be so good
as to come this way, sir?

27:42.628 --> 27:46.785
Oh, and for the last time, get these
wretched people out of my sight.

27:46.990 --> 27:51.072
Put them in the brig, too.
There's no room for civilians here.

27:54.165 --> 27:55.884
This isn't over, Catchlove.

27:56.070 --> 27:58.322
No. It ain't.

27:58.962 --> 28:01.689
Not now Neville Catchlove's
in charge!

28:06.150 --> 28:07.533
DOOR SLAMS

28:08.202 --> 28:09.947
You'll regret this!

28:10.972 --> 28:13.572
In a couple of hours,
you'll be begging for help!

28:15.262 --> 28:19.634
It will take time
to revive all my Warriors.

28:19.687 --> 28:22.376
But perhaps enough are awoken

28:22.512 --> 28:26.275
to go on the offensive.

28:29.634 --> 28:34.215
If either of those creatures get out
of there, we'll be ready for them.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.684
Yes, sir.

28:42.935 --> 28:45.294
Carry on, Sergeant Major.
We won't let you down, sir.

28:46.863 --> 28:48.189
There's no setting for wood!

28:48.237 --> 28:51.724
Why is there still no setting
for wood?! But... you've got a plan?

28:51.853 --> 28:55.153
Yes, of course, I've got a plan.
I'm all plans. I'm MADE of plans!

28:55.293 --> 28:57.412
Who the deuce are you two, really?

28:57.680 --> 29:00.745
You speak of us as though
we're a different species.

29:00.937 --> 29:04.190
You seem to know all about
these... these Ice Warriors.

29:04.292 --> 29:06.346
You seem to know
a lot about most things.

29:06.532 --> 29:10.073
Well, we're sort of police.
Speak for yourself!

29:13.104 --> 29:17.142
What, you can deal big green
Martians and... and... rocket ships,

29:17.190 --> 29:18.676
but you can't deal with us
being the police?

29:18.723 --> 29:20.482
No, no, no, no, no...

29:20.833 --> 29:23.872
It's just such a fanciful notion.
A woman in the police force...!

29:23.990 --> 29:25.167
HE CHUCKLES

29:25.242 --> 29:27.521
Listen, yeah,

29:27.948 --> 29:32.096
I'm going to make allowances for
your Victorian attitudes because...

29:32.550 --> 29:35.878
well, you actually are Victorian...

29:36.505 --> 29:37.948
But... anyway!

29:38.074 --> 29:40.526
Is it true? You deserted?

29:42.931 --> 29:44.362
Why?

29:44.903 --> 29:47.870
Oh, cowardice.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.694
Simple cowardice.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.296
I thought I had it in me to command,
Miss Potts,

29:53.423 --> 29:56.307
but when push came to shove,
I... I flunked it.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.000
Deserted my post.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.313
Catchlove was the only one
who knew and he's bled me dry.

30:05.635 --> 30:07.018
Could have been a fresh start,

30:07.185 --> 30:08.585
for all of us.

30:11.830 --> 30:14.630
- How's it looking out there?
- All quiet.

30:15.617 --> 30:19.057
It's traditional, at this point,
to say, "too quiet".

30:34.230 --> 30:37.394
Always liked the colonel, I did.
Seemed a decent chap.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.081
Well, we must take orders
from the captain now, son.

30:41.314 --> 30:42.793
Them's the rules.

30:42.990 --> 30:44.150
Sir.

30:47.131 --> 30:48.610
Blimey, Sarge.

30:48.830 --> 30:50.448
This is a queer 'un, ain't it?

30:50.565 --> 30:53.542
Something to tell your kids.
I mean... Martians...?!

30:53.831 --> 30:56.940
You just face front and mark your
man when you see him, Vincey lad.

30:57.110 --> 30:58.714
Martian or no Martian.

30:58.862 --> 31:00.972
Wait till Alice hears all this.

31:02.136 --> 31:03.855
Set a date, have you, son?

31:03.903 --> 31:05.136
You and your Alice?

31:05.215 --> 31:08.331
Not yet. I want to have enough
put by to make us comfy.

31:10.190 --> 31:11.908
And then we'll get married
in that little church

31:11.955 --> 31:13.275
with the twisted spire back home.

31:13.870 --> 31:15.990
Down by the river.

31:18.350 --> 31:21.510
It's so green there, Sarge.
It's beautiful.

31:22.588 --> 31:25.236
I miss the trees and the grass!

31:25.344 --> 31:28.703
I never want to see red again in all
my puff. I just want to see...

31:42.956 --> 31:45.808
How, in God's name, did they get
behind us?!

31:47.630 --> 31:49.487
Turn it!

31:49.562 --> 31:51.558
Turn it, for God's sake, 90 degrees!

31:51.722 --> 31:54.175
It won't work, sir,
we need more men!

31:54.257 --> 31:56.619
Catchlove,
this is senseless slaughter!

31:56.667 --> 31:58.330
BLASTER FIRE

32:00.264 --> 32:02.307
PANICKED SHOUTS

32:04.145 --> 32:05.729
Present!

32:05.878 --> 32:07.143
Fire!

32:07.210 --> 32:10.065
Come on, lads!
There's only three of them.

32:10.322 --> 32:12.877
Sleep no more, my Warriors!

32:13.030 --> 32:17.390
Sleep no more, it is time!

32:25.598 --> 32:28.746
Doctor, what do we do?
There's no way out.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.348
Close the gap!

32:34.966 --> 32:37.395
Retreat! Retreat! Run for it!

32:37.472 --> 32:39.512
Sir! What do we do?

32:48.887 --> 32:51.582
Oh, sod this for a game of soldiers.

33:01.574 --> 33:03.121
Friday?

33:05.898 --> 33:08.817
Doctor, we must work together.

33:09.020 --> 33:11.801
Rise, my Ice Warriors!

33:11.886 --> 33:13.543
Rise!

33:21.783 --> 33:24.382
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! Where are you going?
- I'm sorry, Doctor.

33:24.430 --> 33:25.908
Blue funk. Can't help it.

33:25.956 --> 33:28.236
I can't do it! I'm sorry!

33:33.229 --> 33:37.040
- I need a distraction. Good luck!
- You got one.

33:44.849 --> 33:47.295
Oi, Queenie!

33:47.790 --> 33:49.189
Let's talk!

33:49.682 --> 33:51.162
Woman-to-woman!

33:53.670 --> 33:56.311
- You valued my opinion before.
- Perhaps.

33:57.497 --> 34:00.756
But this is war.

34:00.880 --> 34:04.061
Why? Why does it have to be war?

34:04.169 --> 34:06.368
Your Majesty, she's right.

34:06.756 --> 34:09.310
You have forged a new alliance,
I see.

34:10.850 --> 34:12.905
We can stand together.

34:12.996 --> 34:14.554
It's too late.

34:14.641 --> 34:16.498
Mars stands alone!

34:16.598 --> 34:18.077
We are strong.

34:18.164 --> 34:20.630
Soon, all my warriors will wake.

34:20.830 --> 34:24.045
We do not require assistance!

34:26.938 --> 34:28.264
Your Majesty!

34:28.561 --> 34:29.826
Oh, Your Majesty!

34:30.032 --> 34:31.991
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

34:32.039 --> 34:33.398
MACHINERY CLANKS

34:33.469 --> 34:34.739
Stand down. Or I'll fire.

34:34.842 --> 34:36.780
Fire at what?

34:36.989 --> 34:39.889
Well, geography
was never my strong suit,

34:40.024 --> 34:43.194
but aren't we underneath
Mars's north pole?

34:43.348 --> 34:47.827
Over our heads,
millions of tonnes of snow and ice.

34:48.063 --> 34:50.786
One good blast
from the Gargantua here

34:50.989 --> 34:53.194
and your army would be on
ice forever.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.623
Trapped in an eternal winter

34:55.819 --> 34:57.030
like...

34:58.524 --> 35:00.003
..like Frozen!

35:00.802 --> 35:02.322
It's a movie.

35:03.451 --> 35:07.256
You would destroy yourself
at the same time!

35:07.430 --> 35:09.678
That's a price worth paying,
isn't it?

35:09.870 --> 35:12.748
It's a simple choice, Iraxxa,
the oldest one in the book.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.545
We must live together.

35:14.983 --> 35:16.583
Or die together.

35:23.006 --> 35:24.865
You dare to touch me?

35:25.003 --> 35:28.562
Yes, my dear. I do.

35:28.917 --> 35:31.073
Don't do this, Captain!
Don't mess this up.

35:31.144 --> 35:32.941
No choice, old boy.

35:33.269 --> 35:36.136
You see, I suddenly remembered
I need a bit of a hand

35:36.187 --> 35:38.597
getting that ruddy ship
off the ground.

35:38.721 --> 35:42.628
And who better to ask than
the Ice Queen herself?

35:42.974 --> 35:47.370
Call off your dogs, Your Majesty.
Call them off!

35:51.800 --> 35:53.956
That's better.

35:57.612 --> 36:02.784
Course, I will have to dynamite the
lifts to stop you following, but...

36:03.418 --> 36:05.537
Well, war is hell, what?

36:05.632 --> 36:07.316
If you want to escape, I can help.

36:07.440 --> 36:11.230
Just leave Iraxxa with her people.
Don't mess this up.

36:11.441 --> 36:13.120
Thank you, Doctor.

36:13.323 --> 36:14.714
But, um...

36:14.922 --> 36:18.050
I think I prefer my plan.

36:20.111 --> 36:21.400
Gentlemen!

36:21.503 --> 36:24.626
It's been a privilege - however
brief - to command you.

36:24.771 --> 36:27.009
But all good things come to an end.

36:27.520 --> 36:29.423
I think you'll find, Captain...

36:30.974 --> 36:32.619
..that I am in command here.

36:32.667 --> 36:33.714
GUNSHOT

36:33.762 --> 36:35.062
HE GASPS

36:42.553 --> 36:47.994
You sacrificed one of your own
without tactical advantage...?

36:48.075 --> 36:51.434
No, I didn't sacrifice him.
I executed him.

36:51.577 --> 36:55.548
Do you now expect your life
to be spared?

36:55.621 --> 36:59.165
No, no, no!
I expect it to be taken.

36:59.376 --> 37:01.486
And I give it willingly.

37:01.704 --> 37:04.876
No. No, wait, stop this!
Doctor, stop him! Shh!

37:07.962 --> 37:11.572
Some time ago,
I was hanged for cowardice.

37:11.804 --> 37:14.080
The execution took longer
than expected

37:14.286 --> 37:17.236
and I fear I have not
used my time well.

37:17.830 --> 37:21.165
I should be happy for you
to complete the work

37:21.225 --> 37:23.283
they failed to do so long ago.

37:23.510 --> 37:26.033
It will be a pleasure.

37:26.163 --> 37:28.134
- No, please, don't do this.
- Bill, quiet!

37:29.291 --> 37:30.679
He saved your life!

37:30.819 --> 37:33.790
Your Majesty, I have a request,
if that may be permitted.

37:33.886 --> 37:35.462
Speak!

37:35.653 --> 37:37.486
That man was not one of us.

37:37.716 --> 37:41.900
Please, do not judge mankind by his
cruelty or indeed by my cowardice.

37:41.967 --> 37:44.173
Spare my friends and my world.

37:44.313 --> 37:48.587
Your request does you credit,
soldier.

37:48.853 --> 37:51.915
It will be considered.

37:54.033 --> 37:55.540
God save the Queen.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.494
God save the Queen!

37:57.736 --> 38:00.447
You will die with honour,
with bravery,

38:00.673 --> 38:05.783
and in the service of those
you have sworn to protect...

38:05.854 --> 38:11.634
Thank you. You don't know
what that means. Thank you...

38:12.330 --> 38:14.750
..but not today.

38:17.355 --> 38:20.290
In battle, soldier.

38:20.645 --> 38:24.970
To die in battle
is the way of the warrior.

38:25.167 --> 38:30.658
Pledge your allegiance to me
and my world,

38:30.830 --> 38:36.229
and I will ensure
you have the opportunity.

38:36.590 --> 38:40.869
My life and my service are yours.

38:41.111 --> 38:42.648
To the end.

38:42.907 --> 38:46.447
To the death, my friend,

38:46.845 --> 38:49.111
to the death.

38:53.024 --> 38:56.189
- You knew that would happen.
- Always been my problem.

38:56.454 --> 38:57.711
What?

38:57.830 --> 38:59.350
Thinking like a warrior.

39:22.623 --> 39:27.521
There we are. I've sent out
a sort of round-robin e-mail.

39:27.880 --> 39:31.402
All being well, the first
intelligent, space-going system

39:31.670 --> 39:33.615
will be in touch fairly soon.

39:33.990 --> 39:35.443
Thank you, Doctor.

39:35.655 --> 39:41.248
Mars is dead,
but the Ice Warriors will live on.

39:44.402 --> 39:47.881
- Will they make it?
- Oh, yes.

39:48.550 --> 39:52.605
In fact, this might be the beginning
of the Martian Golden Age.

39:52.777 --> 39:56.042
'Are you receiving us?
Mars, are you receiving?'

39:56.160 --> 40:01.160
This is Iraxxa,
Queen Empress of Mars.

40:01.330 --> 40:05.824
'Ah, excellent! We have received
details of your situation.

40:05.921 --> 40:09.183
'We would be happy to send
a fleet to your aid at once.

40:09.258 --> 40:11.042
'A physical marker of some sort

40:11.097 --> 40:13.824
'would be appreciated to guide
our ships.'

40:13.872 --> 40:16.003
To whom am I speaking?

40:16.328 --> 40:19.003
'This is Alpha Centauri.

40:19.449 --> 40:22.495
'Welcome to the universe!'

40:34.001 --> 40:35.240
Big enough?

40:35.499 --> 40:37.498
For the ship to see?

40:37.617 --> 40:38.878
I think so.

40:43.390 --> 40:44.691
You going to be OK?

40:44.796 --> 40:46.915
Well, that's twice
I've been executed.

40:47.269 --> 40:50.144
Whatever happens now, it's got
to be better than I expected.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.502
There's nothing for me back
on Earth.

40:53.613 --> 40:57.422
And to help forge a new world,
well, that will be my privilege.

40:57.636 --> 40:58.902
HE SIGHS

40:59.035 --> 41:00.691
It seems a shame, though...

41:00.963 --> 41:02.243
What does?

41:02.940 --> 41:07.339
Well, no-one back on Earth
will ever know that we got here.

41:07.722 --> 41:09.152
All will be forgotten.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.745
Oh, not quite forgotten, Colonel.

41:12.224 --> 41:16.136
You've changed the mind-set
of a very stubborn Martian monarch.

41:17.925 --> 41:22.270
And one day, even though
the ice cap may obscure it...

41:23.456 --> 41:25.722
..someone's going to notice THAT.

41:52.568 --> 41:56.099
So, what did I miss?

41:56.359 --> 41:57.646
Where have you been?!

41:57.800 --> 42:01.810
Yeah, before you go
getting all frowny, er...

42:02.045 --> 42:03.474
Well, er...

42:21.065 --> 42:22.465
Are you all right?

42:25.730 --> 42:27.130
This can't happen.

42:28.292 --> 42:31.491
This is not what we agreed to.

42:31.777 --> 42:34.269
I'm going to have to put you back
in the Vault. You know that.

42:34.496 --> 42:36.910
Sure, that's fine.

42:37.785 --> 42:39.386
What?

42:39.633 --> 42:42.340
But, Doctor. Please tell me, really.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.480
Are you all right?

42:45.948 --> 42:49.729
Synchronized by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

42:51.270 --> 42:53.137
The Ninth Legion
and the Keeper Of The Gate.

42:53.264 --> 42:55.371
- They disappeared.
- Except they didn't.

42:55.695 --> 42:59.551
Where is my friend and
what destroyed the Roman army?

42:59.870 --> 43:02.636
Something here managed
to wipe out 5,000 Romans.

43:05.616 --> 43:07.535
Every hour of sunlight
that feeds it,

43:07.691 --> 43:12.066
makes the world darker
and the beast stronger.
