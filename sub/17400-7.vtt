00:02.920 --> 00:06.679
It's goat bone? I don't want that.

00:06.680 --> 00:09.839
And it's got a cockerel on it.

00:09.840 --> 00:11.880
Yeah, I'll have one of them
and the kettle.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.959
God! What?

00:13.960 --> 00:15.720
My bed's gone out of alignment.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.999
'Our adventure began
in Uganda where,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.639
'armed with three
Â£1,500 estate cars,

00:23.640 --> 00:27.399
'we were given
a spectacular challenge.'

00:27.400 --> 00:30.480
You will find
the source of the River Nile.

00:33.920 --> 00:38.000
'To make life easier, we converted
our cars into mobile homes.'

00:38.001 --> 00:39.399
Whoa!

00:39.400 --> 00:42.200
What's that? Living quarters
combined with a workshop.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.959
Nobody in the history of Africa

00:48.960 --> 00:52.359
has ever been
more comfortable than this.

00:52.360 --> 00:56.080
'Having failed to find the source
of the Nile in western Uganda...'

00:57.200 --> 01:00.639
Southeast? Yeah. It's no good.

01:00.640 --> 01:04.440
'..we decided the actual source
was in northern Tanzania.'

01:04.441 --> 01:10.039
That means going through Rwanda,
Tanzania to there. Such a long way!

01:10.040 --> 01:11.759
It is a long way. Right.

01:11.760 --> 01:17.919
'And so, a 600-mile journey began,
a journey that has already

01:17.920 --> 01:21.360
'taken us through the toughest
terrain imaginable.'

01:21.361 --> 01:23.639
Argh! Aaarrrrghhh!

01:23.640 --> 01:25.039
Whoa!

01:25.040 --> 01:27.000
Come on! Come on!

01:31.440 --> 01:36.119
'And, on top of all this, it turned
out I was traveling with a thief.'

01:36.120 --> 01:39.599
How long's that been there?
Good grief!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.759
Is that my door?!

01:41.760 --> 01:44.998
Well, you're not using that bit.
You didn't even notice.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.360

'As dawn broke, the peace
and serenity of this beautiful.

02:23.320 --> 02:28.240
'Ugandan morning was shattered
by the bellow of a wild animal.'

02:38.000 --> 02:40.918
Last night, while Hammond
and May were round the campfire

02:40.919 --> 02:45.278
discussing Uganda, I made an
interesting modification to my car.

02:45.279 --> 02:48.518
Yesterday, I discovered hill starts
were very difficult.

02:48.519 --> 02:52.078
I can't ride the clutch because of
the throttle problem and I can't use

02:52.079 --> 02:54.078
the handbrake because it's broken,

02:54.079 --> 02:57.238
so what I've done is fitted
this log at the back.

02:57.239 --> 03:00.398
You tow it along normally, but then
when you want to start on a hill,

03:00.399 --> 03:02.200
you let the car roll back onto it,

03:02.201 --> 03:05.479
use it as a wedge
and set off easily.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.520
It's simple, it's elegant,
it's brilliant.

03:14.560 --> 03:19.480
'As we set off on our long drive,
the mood was a little fractious.'

03:21.160 --> 03:25.360
If I know James May at all,
and I'm sorry to have to say I do,

03:25.361 --> 03:29.679
he won't be so cross about the theft
of part of his bonnet as

03:29.680 --> 03:33.800
he will be about the shoddiness
of the execution of the theft.

03:33.801 --> 03:37.039
It's not a neat job.
That will rankle.

03:37.040 --> 03:38.319
Look at it!

03:38.320 --> 03:40.558
I mean, that looks like
it was done

03:40.559 --> 03:42.958
with a knife and fork
by the council.

03:42.959 --> 03:46.240
It's not square, it's not neat,
he's wasted material,

03:46.241 --> 03:49.639
he's left sharp edges,
it's all bent.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.680
I cannot conceive of the mind
of a man who would look at that

03:52.681 --> 03:55.759
and think that was
the right way to do it.

03:55.760 --> 03:59.078
'I don't mind you taking a bit
of my bonnet, that's fair.

03:59.079 --> 04:01.880
'I do mind you doing such
an appalling bloody job of it,

04:01.881 --> 04:03.519
'you ham-fisted oaf!'

04:03.520 --> 04:05.358
Honestly, I could do a better
job than that

04:05.359 --> 04:06.760
with the end of a bulldozer!

04:06.761 --> 04:09.839
Well, I... I couldn't find any tools.

04:09.840 --> 04:12.198
'The back of the car is full
of bloody tools!

04:12.199 --> 04:15.078
'The biggest tool in this
operation was you!'

04:15.079 --> 04:18.600
A pair of tin snips looks
like a pair of robust scissors

04:18.601 --> 04:23.079
and their function is obvious.
They are obviously not a hammer!

04:23.080 --> 04:26.799
This could go on.
'Obviously not a screwdriver!

04:26.800 --> 04:30.558
'They are obviously not a spanner!
They are obviously designed...'

04:30.559 --> 04:32.960
There we go, that's got rid of him.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.679
'Soon we came to an uphill stretch,

04:38.680 --> 04:40.880
'so I decided to test
my new handbrake.'

04:42.720 --> 04:46.600
Simply pop it off the back,
roll it out.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.600
Watch this.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.440
Roll back.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.119
The wooden handbrake is holding me,
I simply set off.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.080
Here we go.

05:10.040 --> 05:14.399
Yes! So there we are,

05:14.400 --> 05:18.640
hill starting solved!
Sometimes my genius is...

05:19.800 --> 05:21.280
It's almost frightening!

05:23.320 --> 05:25.559
Well, fair dos, that works.

05:25.560 --> 05:31.200
You do have to tow a log about,
but it works. I am a happy man today.

05:33.360 --> 05:39.359
Chaps? Yes? Are we likely to see a
gorilla? I hope we do see a gorilla.

05:39.360 --> 05:40.958
I'd show them my bonnet and say,

05:40.959 --> 05:42.918
"Could you do a better job
than that?"

05:42.919 --> 05:46.480
But look on the bright side, James,
it's going to be a scorcher today.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.600
My God!

06:04.080 --> 06:09.679
Did that..? Dear!

06:09.680 --> 06:13.960
The handbrake bounced up and has
broken my hotel viewing platform.

06:13.961 --> 06:16.679
You've got glass in your duvet!

06:16.680 --> 06:19.239
Stupidest idea in history!

06:19.240 --> 06:21.998
Jeremy,
people walk around here barefoot.

06:21.999 --> 06:24.840
You've got to sweep all this stuff.
We have.

06:24.841 --> 06:29.879
But look - God gave us a tool
for just such a moment as this.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.038
Would you not agree this is
the ideal tool, James, for this job?

06:33.039 --> 06:36.520
Yes, hammers do have their uses.
I can think of one right now.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.200
'After cleaning up my mess,

06:39.201 --> 06:44.200
'we carried on through yet more
breathtaking countryside.'

06:51.600 --> 06:54.520
Look at the state of that view.
Wait a minute.

06:59.920 --> 07:04.440
Does the world get any
prettier than this?

07:13.720 --> 07:17.080
'In fact the only blot
on the landscape was our hideous.

07:17.081 --> 07:19.280
'Ford Scorpio back-up car.'

07:21.960 --> 07:26.080
I've just realised I forgot to eat
anything this morning. I'm starving.

07:26.081 --> 07:31.159
Well, Hammond made me a lovely plate
of beans. Beans? What sort of beans?

07:31.160 --> 07:33.000
Do you know, they were baked?!

07:35.720 --> 07:40.799
'Soon, the dirt track gave way to
some perfect Chinese-built roads,

07:40.800 --> 07:44.480
'a blessed relief
for our battered cars.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.879
'And after a simple 50-mile cruise,

07:54.880 --> 07:56.840
'we reached the border.'

08:00.720 --> 08:07.159
Goodbye, Uganda, and thank you. That
was an education. And now, Rwanda.

08:07.160 --> 08:08.840
I don't know anything about Rwanda.

08:10.080 --> 08:13.680
'As it turned out,
James knew even less.'

08:16.080 --> 08:21.999
James? What? Apparently they drive on
the other side of the road in Rwanda.

08:22.000 --> 08:27.960
Do they really James, really,
we're not fooling you! Yeah, yeah.

08:39.159 --> 08:43.958
'Mercifully, there was more Chinese
tarmac, so we were able to surge

08:43.960 --> 08:46.438
'through a country where,
actually, none of us

08:46.439 --> 08:48.560
'had really known what to expect.'

08:51.560 --> 08:54.279
In 1994,
this country witnessed

08:54.280 --> 08:57.720
the worst genocide
in the history of humankind.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.080
A million people
died in around about three months.

09:03.800 --> 09:07.560
A million people in three months!
With machetes and garden tools.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.359
And that was only 18 years ago,
and now look.

09:12.360 --> 09:17.240
It's incredible how quickly things,
on the surface at least...

09:18.400 --> 09:19.440
..mend themselves.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.439
Hello!
Hello! Hello, hello!

09:28.440 --> 09:30.319
It's constant.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.678
All the roads,
even out here in the sticks,

09:32.679 --> 09:35.038
are just absolutely
three-deep in people,

09:35.039 --> 09:38.000
and they all wave when you go by
and you have to wave back.

09:38.001 --> 09:42.879
Hello! Hello! Hello, hello.
Hello. Hello.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.920
Hello! Hello.

09:51.960 --> 09:55.279
'After many more miles of waving,
smooth tarmac

09:55.280 --> 09:56.720
'and stunning scenery...

09:59.320 --> 10:04.160
'..we arrived on the other side of
Rwanda at its border with Tanzania.'

10:07.120 --> 10:10.200
That was a long drive,
but we've done it - all of Rwanda.

10:11.440 --> 10:14.480
Now for an interminably long wait.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.678
'The paperwork did indeed
take an age,

10:18.679 --> 10:22.240
'but, happily, Jeremy
and I found a way to pass the time.'

10:24.560 --> 10:26.520
Funny Ha-ha-ha

10:28.560 --> 10:31.920
'And then, finally,
we crossed over into Tanzania.'

10:33.360 --> 10:35.398
Shall we make camp here, gentlemen?

10:35.399 --> 10:39.320
It's been a long drive with a long
border crossing of 900 hours.

'Despite the calm
stillness of the evening,

in his bonnet about his bonnet.'

10:58.360 --> 11:02.999
This evening
I am going to need... these.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.799
And I'm going to need these

11:05.800 --> 11:07.839
and this.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.479
And I'm going to need
these tin snips,

11:11.480 --> 11:16.359
which are like scissors but much
stronger. I'm going to need those.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.440
I'm going to need all these
things for this evening.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.199
Right, I'm up to 18 million
pieces of glass.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.720
Look in another fold, there you go -
18 million and two, three...

11:27.721 --> 11:32.439
Why do they call this stuff
safety glass? I mean, it isn't!

11:32.440 --> 11:34.560
Why can't it just
break into four pieces?

11:34.561 --> 11:38.119
Why does it have to
break into 19 million pieces?

11:38.120 --> 11:40.079
And it goes everywhere!

11:40.080 --> 11:42.360
You could be in bed
and it's outside your house

11:42.361 --> 11:45.039
and it goes in your pyjamas!

11:45.040 --> 11:47.160
18 million and ten.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.000
No.

11:54.520 --> 11:55.560
No.

12:00.560 --> 12:02.120
No.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.520
Yes.

12:09.440 --> 12:10.920
No.

12:45.560 --> 12:47.399
Good morning, viewers.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.080
I'm afraid things may have got
a little out of hand in camp

12:50.081 --> 12:52.559
last night, but it's good news!

12:52.560 --> 12:57.360
I found another piece of scrap metal
and I managed to mend my bonnet!

13:00.600 --> 13:06.039
I'll admit, I was FURIOUS when James
stole my bonnet scoop, but then

13:06.040 --> 13:10.520
on Jeremy's car, I found something
that does the job just as well.

13:10.521 --> 13:13.120
I'm calling it the poop scoop.

13:14.520 --> 13:20.119
I was a bit cross about losing
my lavatory, but then, staggeringly,

13:20.120 --> 13:24.399
in the middle of a remote field
in Tanzania, I found

13:24.400 --> 13:27.879
a rear window that fitted
into the back of my car!

13:27.880 --> 13:31.599
I mean,
it looks like it's meant to be here!

13:31.600 --> 13:33.520
It's uncanny!

13:35.800 --> 13:39.680
'Unfortunately, the modifications to
Hammond's now half-timbered Subaru

13:39.681 --> 13:43.479
'seem to have
impaired his visibility.'

13:46.160 --> 13:47.880
No!

13:49.800 --> 13:51.679
Bad!

13:51.680 --> 13:54.120
Anyway, we've woken up,
slightly thick heads.

13:54.121 --> 13:55.839
We're all mates again,

13:55.840 --> 13:59.118
which is just as well, because
we've got an extremely long day...

14:08.720 --> 14:14.999
That is a river. Yes, it is. Well,
there must be a bridge somewhere.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.878
Why MUST there be a bridge? Well,
there must be! Well, there isn't!

14:17.879 --> 14:21.440
Look! Well, there isn't one THERE,
but there'll be a bridge.

14:21.441 --> 14:26.599
I know what.
It's time to deploy the ARU. What?

14:26.600 --> 14:29.599
The ARU -
Aerial Reconnaissance Unit.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.838
I knew this sort of thing would
happen. Where did that come from?

14:32.839 --> 14:35.798
I've been working on it for
the last couple of weeks at home

14:35.799 --> 14:39.598
for just such an eventuality.
Have you? Have you really?

14:39.599 --> 14:44.080
Did you build it? Yeah. Really? Well,
you've got a helicopter license.

14:44.081 --> 14:45.679
You fly it. Right.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.480
I operate the camera underneath

14:47.481 --> 14:51.680
that swivels about and you tell us
what it's seeing, James.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.160
Right, are we ready?
Yes, I've got a picture.

14:57.161 --> 14:59.360
Hammond? Yes... Begin!

15:04.480 --> 15:07.600
Yes! There she goes!
There you go. That's good.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.478
Right, that height is good.
Now head that way, down the river.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.158
Point it down. You're not pointing
it at the river. Point it down.

15:16.159 --> 15:17.918
Well, you'll need to point it down.

15:17.919 --> 15:20.240
No, you fly level,
you point the camera down. Yeah.

15:22.640 --> 15:24.638
Got it. River turns left...
That's good.

15:24.639 --> 15:26.640
There's no bridge, though.
Keep going.

15:28.080 --> 15:29.240
Pivot right a bit.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.640
Swivel left, camera.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.119
Hang on a minute. What?

15:38.120 --> 15:41.358
There's like a big weir thing.
It's not a weir, James!

15:41.359 --> 15:44.318
That's the biggest waterfall
I've ever seen!

15:44.319 --> 15:47.200
Right, that's relevant
Right, good. No bridge.

15:48.720 --> 15:52.000
'And it was the same story
when we looked upstream.'

15:54.160 --> 15:55.520
Bring it back, Hammond.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.520
'With the ARU back at base...

16:01.560 --> 16:04.800
'..we had to work out how
we could cross this river

16:04.801 --> 16:09.440
'that was full of killer waterfalls,
bilharzia and many teeth.'

16:14.440 --> 16:20.479
Why don't we build... a car ferry?
What, with like a bar and everything?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.920
No, no!
Like that thing we saw in Albania!

16:22.921 --> 16:25.919
Like a raft? Why don't WE build one?

16:25.920 --> 16:28.840
Look, I used to build them when I
was a kid! I fell in a lot, but...

16:28.841 --> 16:34.199
Wood... What else do you need?
Rope. Oil drums.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.478
You need to lash the rope together.
Maybe some nails and a hammer.

16:37.479 --> 16:40.558
Probably a hammer, yeah.
Oil drums, oil drums underneath.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.758
This sounds like the worst
management course ever!

16:42.759 --> 16:46.398
You know those Outward Bound courses
where you've got a chicken and...

16:46.399 --> 16:49.038
OK, then. Thanks to Hammond,
it's back to the studio.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.158
All we need is a platform

16:50.159 --> 16:52.878
big enough to take a car that
will take its weight and floats.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.518
Then we pull it across on ropes
like the Albanian one.

16:55.519 --> 16:57.438
We drove through a village,
did we not,

16:57.439 --> 16:59.758
about... just behind those
banana trees?

16:59.759 --> 17:01.958
Yes, but do you think
they sell rafts for cars?

17:01.959 --> 17:04.798
They might sell car ferries. No,
but they've always got...

17:04.799 --> 17:08.518
Don't want a banana, don't want
a headscarf, I'd like a car ferry.

17:08.519 --> 17:11.798
"We've got one in the back, sir."
Look, I'm going to divide this up.

17:11.799 --> 17:16.040
I'm going to find some rope. You go
and find some oil drums. You go...

17:16.040 --> 17:18.479
I'll get some wood. And some wood.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.120
Right, off you go. Have you got
the hammer and stake? Yeah.

17:37.160 --> 17:39.240
Your rope's come off!

17:42.360 --> 17:45.160
You're getting nearer, James!
I'm not!

17:49.520 --> 17:52.520
Would you say you were nearer,
James? No.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.719
'With HMS Wobbly in the water,

18:03.720 --> 18:07.320
'Hammond and May decided that
my car should go first.'

18:12.960 --> 18:17.159
Good. A tiny, tiny bit left.
Straight, that's good.

18:17.160 --> 18:19.119
Hold on.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.440
You need to go... BLEEP.
It's close. Tiny bit right.

18:24.760 --> 18:29.759
OK, your back wheels are on.
I am now boarding our ferry.

18:29.760 --> 18:34.320
That's good. 'As I inched forwards,
a hungry audience gathered.'

18:37.120 --> 18:39.440
You'll feel when you're on
cos you'll hit the chock.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.160
Two and a half feet. Feet?! Yeah.

18:46.800 --> 18:50.518
Good, a bit more. You're just
about to... There you go, you're on!

18:50.519 --> 18:51.880
Put it in gear and turn off.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.280
These have got to come with us
for the other side.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.559
'With the ramps on board,
we set off.'

19:01.560 --> 19:04.679
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.119
What did you just do? Cast off.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.439
Are we now underway? Yes.
Pull on the rope. I am.

19:11.440 --> 19:13.079
I'm Geoff Capes!

19:13.080 --> 19:17.679
I am pulling a BMW 528i Touring
across a crocodile-infested river!

19:17.680 --> 19:21.038
And the impressive thing is, you're
not making a fuss about it either.

19:21.039 --> 19:23.278
No, I'm not showing off, but I am...

19:23.279 --> 19:24.918
James, wait! James, James, James!

19:24.919 --> 19:26.718
What? It doesn't make any
difference.

19:26.719 --> 19:29.038
Stay at the back!
James, please stay at the back!

19:29.039 --> 19:31.798
Stop being such an old woman -
it doesn't make any difference!

19:31.799 --> 19:34.798
Really? So that barrel's just
come back above the water again...

19:34.799 --> 19:37.558
But it's not going to go
all the way down, is it?

19:40.560 --> 19:44.038
Right... So if I get on the bank
and James throws me a yellow rope...

19:44.039 --> 19:46.238
Good idea.
Can you get on the bank from there?

19:46.239 --> 19:49.640
These logs get really slippery! Yes.
Right, you're on the bank...

19:51.280 --> 19:52.318
Good catch

19:52.319 --> 19:55.360
The throw wasn't brilliant.
I'll go to the back. Whey!

19:57.480 --> 19:58.640
Well...

20:00.840 --> 20:03.800
People are now turning over to watch
Red Or Black? Or something.

20:03.801 --> 20:06.319
I'm sorry we made it.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.798
Nobody was expecting that.

20:07.799 --> 20:08.838
Got it?

20:08.839 --> 20:12.920
'Mind you, there was still the small
matter of disembarking.'

20:16.120 --> 20:17.679
..not convinced.

20:17.680 --> 20:19.680
Yes!

20:23.640 --> 20:25.400
Well, you're NEARLY ashore.

20:25.401 --> 20:27.119
Aren't I ashore?

20:27.120 --> 20:29.079
Not entirely ashore, no.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.239
Yes, I'm ashore.

20:31.240 --> 20:32.880
Is that wheel ashore? Yes.

20:32.881 --> 20:35.239
'We weren't convinced,

20:35.240 --> 20:37.080
'so we gave him a helping hand.'

20:37.081 --> 20:38.280
Here we go!

20:38.281 --> 20:40.199
Yes!

20:40.200 --> 20:41.399
Feeling good.

20:41.400 --> 20:44.119
Yes, yes!

20:44.120 --> 20:46.279
God, I'm a good driver.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.919
'Back on the other bank,

20:53.920 --> 20:55.958
'it was Hammond's turn,
and for some reason,

20:55.959 --> 20:58.560
'he decided to make life difficult
for himself.'

20:58.561 --> 21:00.759
Why are you BACKING on?

21:00.760 --> 21:04.878
Because it is quite difficult getting
off at the other side, yeah? Yeah.

21:04.879 --> 21:07.438
And your BMW is now there
so it could tow me off.

21:07.439 --> 21:09.078
The only towing eye is at the back.

21:09.079 --> 21:11.520
It does mean I'll have to
reverse on.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.920
Hold on, hold on!
Does that look right from there?

21:15.921 --> 21:17.719
What...?

21:23.960 --> 21:26.438
Stop! Stop!
You're turning the wheel.

21:26.439 --> 21:29.680
I did NOT turn the wheel.
You turned it minutely.

21:29.681 --> 21:31.519
I might have leant on it.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.000
You're miles off the end.
A little more.

21:36.001 --> 21:37.319
And... stop.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.599
I am SO onboard!

21:39.600 --> 21:42.758
James, you can pull this time,
you'll see how easy it is

21:42.759 --> 21:45.638
I shall be ballast, there.
That's the ticket!

21:45.639 --> 21:49.040
Not all at the same time.
You can't come on this side.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.119
I can't go on the other side.

21:51.120 --> 21:53.838
Look at the angle.
Gentlemen... Climb through the car.

21:53.839 --> 21:56.078
..It is impossible to stand there

21:56.079 --> 21:59.238
because there are two ramps piled
on top of one another.

21:59.239 --> 22:00.878
Hammond, get in your sitting room!

22:00.879 --> 22:02.798
I can't.
Get in your sitting room! No!

22:02.799 --> 22:04.200
You need to be on the other side.

22:04.201 --> 22:06.959
Climb over the bloody car.

22:06.960 --> 22:10.120
You've got heavier...

22:11.200 --> 22:15.200
That was tied on! No, I took
the rope off. We needed the rope.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.679
I took it off.

22:16.680 --> 22:19.199
I CAN go on the other side...

22:19.200 --> 22:20.639
as it turns out.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.680
Perfect. Let's go. Forget the chair.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.119
Are we there yet

22:28.120 --> 22:30.079
Somebody's had me chair!

22:30.080 --> 22:31.560
That man's got your chair!

22:31.561 --> 22:34.719
Good for him. Enjoy it!

22:34.720 --> 22:35.999
Ooh!

22:36.000 --> 22:39.880
'On the other side, I was determined
to make a better job of disembarking

22:39.881 --> 22:41.480
'than Jeremy had.'

22:43.480 --> 22:45.039
Power. Hoo!

22:45.040 --> 22:46.999
Some of you's onboard.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.800
Whoa, we got a problem.

22:51.280 --> 22:54.880
That's all completely hopeless
and you've sunk the raft

22:54.881 --> 22:56.920
and your catflap's terrible.

22:59.839 --> 23:01.560
'I then pulled Hammond off...'

23:01.561 --> 23:03.519
Ya-hey!

23:03.520 --> 23:05.919
'..And that gave me an idea.'

23:05.920 --> 23:09.199
Why don't we use this to pull
the ferry across

23:09.200 --> 23:10.680
with the Volvo on it?

23:13.480 --> 23:15.120
Why would we not do that?

23:16.920 --> 23:21.120
'Rather sceptically, Hammond and I
went back to get my Volvo.'

23:21.121 --> 23:24.559
Crack on.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.318
Our father, who art in heaven,

23:26.319 --> 23:29.080
if you're there,
make it go upside down, please.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.039
Steady! Wooh!

23:35.040 --> 23:37.719
Ooh!

23:37.720 --> 23:40.639
Shall I come back? Just a tiny bit.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.879
Wah-duh...! Stop making
squeaking noises.

23:43.880 --> 23:47.999
The thing is, the BMW has
a 50-50 weight distribution.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.840
50% over the front axle,
50% over the back,

23:50.841 --> 23:53.239
which is why the raft was level.

23:53.240 --> 23:54.679
With James' car,

23:54.680 --> 23:58.039
70% of the weight is over
the front axle.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.560
That's why the whole thing
is tipping down.

24:00.561 --> 24:02.439
Are we attached? Yes.

24:02.440 --> 24:05.319
Jeremy, we have begun!

24:05.320 --> 24:08.119
Right,
so I pull you across the river.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.519
Yeah, gently.

24:09.520 --> 24:12.440
Very, very slowly indeed!

24:13.680 --> 24:16.200
If it goes under,
it'll probably go nose-in, won't it?

24:16.201 --> 24:20.519
Yeah, I'll stand at the back.
Are you ready?

24:20.520 --> 24:22.719
He's going already, hang on.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.120
This is Captain Hammond
ringing down to the engine room.

24:25.121 --> 24:28.600
You have the slacks.
That's plenty fast enough!

24:29.880 --> 24:32.639
Yes, gently.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.719
Seriously, Jeremy.
We are going under.

24:35.720 --> 24:37.679
That's too fast, too fast!

24:37.680 --> 24:39.759
Yes!

24:39.760 --> 24:40.880
Yes!

24:42.120 --> 24:43.840
Gently, gently - seriously!

24:43.841 --> 24:45.159
We're going in.

24:46.640 --> 24:51.479
Jeremy, absolutely stop
or you'll have deaths on your hands.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.959
I've been shouted at so much.

24:54.960 --> 24:56.720
Need a zesty drink.

25:02.280 --> 25:08.959
'Eventually, our third and final car
was ready to go ashore.'

25:08.960 --> 25:11.400
Forward. My Gawd!

25:13.160 --> 25:16.039
Well, credit where it's due.

25:16.040 --> 25:18.040
Come on!

25:19.840 --> 25:22.960
You have to admit that is quite
a finish, with a flourish!

25:25.160 --> 25:29.559
'It had been a fraught undertaking,
but the fact was that,

25:29.560 --> 25:31.079
'against the odds,

25:31.080 --> 25:35.399
'all three of our cars were
on the other side of the river.'

25:35.400 --> 25:38.198
That's the first time,
I think, in ten years,

25:38.199 --> 25:39.558
we've ever done anything

25:39.559 --> 25:41.158
ambitious and successful.

25:41.159 --> 25:43.680
I think you're right.
And doesn't it feel good?

25:43.681 --> 25:45.639
It feels weird, frankly.

25:45.640 --> 25:48.400
Normally there's one of us
in the water, in the jaws of a lion,

25:48.401 --> 25:50.119
going, "He's dead!"

25:50.120 --> 25:51.520
It was genuinely peculiar.

25:51.521 --> 25:53.159
My God!

25:57.840 --> 26:00.559
It's gone! It's completely gone!

26:00.560 --> 26:01.920
It's completely sunk!

26:01.921 --> 26:03.799
Well done

26:03.800 --> 26:05.800
You can see how difficult
OUR job is.

26:05.801 --> 26:07.999
That's how deep it was!

26:08.000 --> 26:10.078
That could have happened to us.

26:10.079 --> 26:12.600
- It could have done...
- But it didn't!

26:12.601 --> 26:14.119
Onwards.

26:14.120 --> 26:17.319
'Leaving the producers to
clear up their mess,

26:17.320 --> 26:18.720
'we set off.

26:22.480 --> 26:25.478
'And soon discovered that
Tanzania's roads were not

26:25.479 --> 26:26.800
'built by the Chinese.'

26:28.280 --> 26:32.599
Pothole, pothole, pothole,
pothole. BIG one.

26:32.600 --> 26:35.799
It is like driving through
a minefield.

26:35.800 --> 26:39.679
If you take your eye
off the road for a second,

26:39.680 --> 26:42.560
you are into one
and they are massive.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.398
I don't know how James
will cope with this,

26:47.399 --> 26:50.280
because you can only
concentrate on one thing at a time

26:50.281 --> 26:55.359
and when he's driving that is
normally an obscure poet.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.560
"Yes, Philip Larkin's done some
very good... no,."

26:58.561 --> 27:00.439
"I've hit a pothole."

27:00.440 --> 27:02.519
'Soon James hit a pothole...'

27:04.120 --> 27:06.039
No!

27:06.040 --> 27:10.119
'..So hard,
it took out two of his tyres.'

27:10.120 --> 27:13.239
Erm... d'you remember...

27:13.240 --> 27:15.079
it seems like months ago,

27:15.080 --> 27:18.358
but at the beginning of this voyage,
we looked at these tyres and said,

27:18.359 --> 27:20.918
"There's no way those tyres will
survive Africa?"

27:20.919 --> 27:23.160
The signs are not good, are they?

27:23.161 --> 27:25.639
In that they're not. It's goodbye.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.358
You just wait here for the backup
car. You know the code.

27:28.359 --> 27:29.758
No, the backup car's

27:29.759 --> 27:32.078
at the bottom of a
crocodile-infested river.

27:32.079 --> 27:34.198
I don't need the backup car,
I have spare wheels.

27:34.199 --> 27:36.920
You're not very helpful or useful
to me. I'll see you later.

27:36.921 --> 27:39.000
See you, James. Bye. Bye!

27:40.280 --> 27:42.800
'Once the Annoying Brothers
had left,

27:42.801 --> 27:46.719
'I discovered it was rather more
than just tyre damage.'

27:46.720 --> 27:49.519
Ho-ho-ho!

27:49.520 --> 27:52.720
'Both wheels had shattered!

27:56.400 --> 27:58.998
'Having raided the support
truck for more,

27:58.999 --> 28:01.000
'I set off and caught up
with the others

28:01.001 --> 28:03.320
'in a swarm of lake flies.'

28:11.560 --> 28:15.399
'This told us we were getting
close to Lake Victoria.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.879
'At 150 miles across,

28:18.880 --> 28:21.800
it was too wide for us to even think
about building a homemade ferry.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.960
'So we decided to use one someone
else had made earlier.'

28:28.640 --> 28:31.120
Have you ever seen more
flies than that

28:31.121 --> 28:33.119
in one place ever?

28:36.920 --> 28:39.078
I'll give you a million pounds
if you go

28:39.079 --> 28:41.000
and stand there naked for an hour.

29:20.040 --> 29:22.760
'The voyage across Lake Victoria
took more than

29:22.761 --> 29:26.639
'16 hours, but there was
good news on the other side.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.278
'The ferry would drop us
close to the River Grumeti,

29:29.279 --> 29:31.600
'the river that WE believed
would take us

29:31.601 --> 29:34.440
'to the source of the Nile.'

29:39.280 --> 29:41.520
We're going to find
the mouth of the river,

29:41.521 --> 29:44.399
track that back to its source,

29:44.400 --> 29:46.040
and we've done it.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.880
30 seconds...

29:58.640 --> 30:01.440
'Keen to demonstrate
the advantage of four-wheel drive

30:01.441 --> 30:03.679
'to the bewildered crowd,

30:03.680 --> 30:06.399
'Hammond insisted on going first.'

30:06.400 --> 30:09.000
Right, here we go.

30:26.920 --> 30:28.120
I am ashore!

30:41.160 --> 30:43.838
'You're letting
yourself down, the BBC, '

30:43.839 --> 30:47.000
and the whole country with your
incompetence, Hammond.

30:49.120 --> 30:51.040
Come on!

30:52.360 --> 30:55.199
Sorry about that, Skipper!

30:55.200 --> 30:57.719
Leave him. We can leave him.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.999
'And so...

31:00.000 --> 31:01.360
'we did.'

31:02.640 --> 31:04.480
Bye, Hammond! Bye!

31:07.080 --> 31:08.759
Hello.

31:08.760 --> 31:09.960
Hello.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.998
'As we disembarked a few miles away
on a proper landing jetty,

31:16.999 --> 31:19.680
'Hammond was being
rescued by the locals.'

31:23.400 --> 31:25.320
We're coming out!

31:30.640 --> 31:32.759
Everybody needs money now

31:32.760 --> 31:34.759
and I don't have any money.

31:34.760 --> 31:36.360
Erm...

31:38.440 --> 31:40.360
I've got biscuits.

31:41.760 --> 31:44.439
More biscuits, more sweets.

31:44.440 --> 31:45.720
One second.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.159
OK, this is becoming alarming.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.519
Erm...

31:52.520 --> 31:55.360
I've got crisps.

31:58.000 --> 32:02.000
'With my lunch all gone,
I rejoined my colleagues.'

32:04.680 --> 32:07.440
With hindsight, offering up
biscuits was a mistake.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.519
Yes,
when you have 40 mouths to feed,

32:12.520 --> 32:15.480
unless you're Jesus,
starting with two biscuits

32:15.481 --> 32:16.880
isn't brilliant.

32:18.720 --> 32:21.078
Well, that arrival
was very happy and glorious

32:21.079 --> 32:23.238
and we're excellent
ambassadors for Britain

32:23.239 --> 32:25.360
and her long tradition
of exploration.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.399
In other news,

32:27.400 --> 32:29.640
I've fitted a fan.

32:34.360 --> 32:38.920
'We then broke out the map and went
off to find the mouth of our river.

32:41.120 --> 32:44.440
'The beautiful and majestic
Grumeti.'

32:53.000 --> 32:55.679
In my mind, it was prettier. Yes.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.800
This is quiet, though.
It's not quiet.

32:57.801 --> 33:01.999
I admit, it's not picturesque
and it's not peaceful,

33:02.000 --> 33:04.440
but if we find the source of this...

33:04.441 --> 33:05.879
We've done it.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.958
..You can't argue,
we're in the history books.

33:07.959 --> 33:10.440
It flows through Lake Victoria,
into the Nile,

33:10.441 --> 33:11.959
along the Nile,

33:11.960 --> 33:14.078
through the Med
and into the Atlantic.

33:14.079 --> 33:16.040
And as far as I can work out,

33:16.041 --> 33:17.679
it's there.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.039
That's about 70 miles.

33:20.040 --> 33:23.198
We only have 70 miles to do.
The good news is, look, some of it,

33:23.199 --> 33:25.440
you can follow the river
on that road.

33:25.441 --> 33:28.759
But that bit, the last bit,

33:28.760 --> 33:31.479
it's off-road. Yeah.

33:31.480 --> 33:34.879
Look, there's no tracks or anything.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.960
Well... So, that's it.
It can only get prettier.

33:40.800 --> 33:44.800
'And it did, because soon
we were in the Serengeti.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.400
'A vast plain teaming with animals,
all of which, as usual,

33:56.401 --> 34:00.160
'were way beyond the reach
of our camera teams.'

34:05.200 --> 34:07.320
Wildebeest! Wildebeest!

34:10.440 --> 34:12.639
A zebra.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.359
I've seen more already here
on the Serengeti

34:21.360 --> 34:23.797
than I saw in
Sir Richard Hammondborough's.

34:23.799 --> 34:25.518
Planet Earth Live programme.

34:25.518 --> 34:28.797
'Why didn't you show us
all of these animals, Hammond,

34:28.799 --> 34:30.958
'on your Planet Earth Live
programme?

34:30.958 --> 34:33.400
'There's millions of them
we could have looked at!'

34:33.400 --> 34:35.000
Shut up!

34:38.239 --> 34:41.880
'Soon, we stopped to check on the
course of our "beautiful" river.

34:41.880 --> 34:46.520
'And here we saw the most
amazing wildlife yet.'

34:49.719 --> 34:53.159
They are the funniest creatures
on earth, aren't they?

34:55.920 --> 34:57.520
Why are they so funny?

35:00.440 --> 35:03.038
This one's been to
the Daktari shop in Florida,

35:03.039 --> 35:04.278
hasn't he, for his outfit?

35:04.279 --> 35:06.478
Every single piece of kit,
he's got the lot.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.998
I don't know why,
but American tourists -

35:08.999 --> 35:12.478
and I know we're watched in America,
I'm not saying you're all like this,

35:12.479 --> 35:14.680
but when you travel,
you're hysterical.

35:16.680 --> 35:20.520
'Sadly, the Americans departed,
leaving us with nothing to look at

35:20.521 --> 35:22.639
'except some hippos.

35:22.640 --> 35:26.000
'So we got back on the road
for the last few miles

35:26.001 --> 35:29.080
'of our epic journey.'

35:31.800 --> 35:35.279
I'm going to put my hand
on my heart and say this

35:35.280 --> 35:37.880
is the best Top Gear adventure
we've ever had.

35:37.881 --> 35:40.759
It's a noble quest in a truly

35:40.760 --> 35:45.199
stunningly beautiful country
full of utterly hospitable people.

35:45.200 --> 35:49.040
'And then, of course,
there were our cars.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.880
'A trio of 1,500-quid high-milers.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.558
'All had been presumably sold

35:56.559 --> 36:00.480
'because their owners thought
they were on their last legs,

36:00.481 --> 36:04.199
'but they'd come here and
taken on the worst

36:04.200 --> 36:07.200
'that Africa could throw at them,
and they'd survived.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.678
'But which had been the most
impressive?

36:11.679 --> 36:15.640
'Well, at the next river check,
we had a chat about that.'

36:16.720 --> 36:18.920
Normally we pick one car
that's best.

36:18.921 --> 36:21.039
Mm. I think on this occasion,

36:21.040 --> 36:23.838
I can't be convinced mine
isn't the best,

36:23.839 --> 36:25.758
But I'm sure you're in the same...

36:25.759 --> 36:28.878
I wouldn't allow anybody to
convince me mine isn't the best.

36:28.879 --> 36:29.958
So, in other words,

36:29.959 --> 36:32.478
let's, on this occasion,
just agree to disagree

36:32.479 --> 36:34.358
and say they're all the best. Yes.

36:34.359 --> 36:36.800
Like one of those primary school
sports days.

36:36.801 --> 36:38.919
Yes. Everybody gets a prize.

36:38.920 --> 36:41.958
You've all won.
There are no losers at St Barnabas'.

36:41.959 --> 36:44.438
Let's go with that,
they are all the best.

36:44.439 --> 36:46.638
That's fair.
They've all done well together.

36:46.639 --> 36:50.240
Let us now find the source of
this disgusting, scummy river. OK.

36:52.240 --> 36:53.879
Rubbish!

36:53.880 --> 36:57.398
If this WERE a school sports day,
here's how it's worked out.

36:57.399 --> 37:00.598
Everyone's got all excited
because the BMW, the fat kid,

37:00.599 --> 37:03.518
and the Volvo, the geeky,
specky, nerdy kid,

37:03.519 --> 37:05.640
have finished the cross-country
course.

37:05.641 --> 37:08.959
"Well done,
we're so amazed you did it!"

37:08.960 --> 37:11.558
But let's not forget
the fact that the genuinely

37:11.559 --> 37:14.400
sporty kid, the Subaru,
who's actually good at this stuff,

37:14.401 --> 37:17.439
also finished and finished well.

37:17.440 --> 37:20.040
Because it's the best. Fact.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.038
Ten minutes after this
show's finished,

37:27.039 --> 37:29.478
you won't be able to describe
what Jeremy was driving,

37:29.479 --> 37:31.840
but you'll be able to describe
this...

37:31.841 --> 37:34.639
because it's got personality,
character,

37:34.640 --> 37:37.239
something about it.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.760
I'm going to miss it.

37:41.800 --> 37:44.758
Now we're alone, viewers,
I can tell you that the Volvo

37:44.759 --> 37:47.680
is the best car here.
Because, let's not forget,

37:47.681 --> 37:49.799
this is a family estate.

37:49.800 --> 37:55.439
It's a family estate pretending
to be a BTCC racing car.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.078
So it's compromised, as well.

37:57.079 --> 37:59.720
It shouldn't be here,
it shouldn't have got this far,

37:59.721 --> 38:01.559
but it is and it has,

38:01.560 --> 38:03.679
and that's why I love it!

38:03.680 --> 38:05.840
It has the biggest heart.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.839
How can May possibly say

38:09.840 --> 38:11.838
that his Volvo's better than this?

38:11.839 --> 38:14.640
It's been like a seal
on the entire journey,

38:14.641 --> 38:17.999
endlessly dragging its stomach
along the floor.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.399
And it broke his back.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.000
He'd have been better off
doing this journey

38:23.001 --> 38:24.319
on a space hopper.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.719
Then we have Hammond's "Tubaru,"

38:26.720 --> 38:28.800
which is as needlessly complicated

38:28.801 --> 38:32.079
as those idiotic trousers
he insists on wearing

38:32.080 --> 38:34.878
with all their special pockets
and clips for mossie spray

38:34.879 --> 38:37.600
and a hunting knife
with a special compass.

38:37.601 --> 38:38.959
What's the point?

38:38.960 --> 38:43.799
I've done the entire journey
in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.

38:43.800 --> 38:46.559
And that's what the 5 Series is,

38:46.560 --> 38:48.919
it's the familiarity of home...

38:48.920 --> 38:50.280
here.

38:53.600 --> 38:57.318
You're a car, you're a sitting-room,
you're a bedroom, you're a fridge,

38:57.319 --> 39:00.840
you're a power station that charges
up my phone every night,

39:00.841 --> 39:04.399
but most of all what you are,
what you've become -

39:04.400 --> 39:07.159
is a mate.

39:07.160 --> 39:10.199
And that is what makes
a car special.

39:10.200 --> 39:11.800
That's what makes a car great.

39:11.801 --> 39:14.560
You start to think of it
as a person.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.680
You start to love it.

39:19.160 --> 39:23.358
'What our cars deserved now was
a relaxing cruise to the finish.

39:23.359 --> 39:25.280
'But that wasn't going to happen.'

39:27.200 --> 39:29.520
Aaaagh! Aaaagh! No!

39:31.280 --> 39:32.880
Whoa! Geez!

39:34.680 --> 39:38.319
'The road was a rutted nightmare,

39:38.320 --> 39:41.080
'and it was peppered
with sharp stones.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.240
'It was a car killer.'

39:45.400 --> 39:48.200
This is absolute
puncture alley, this.

39:50.360 --> 39:52.000
Bloody Nora!

39:57.240 --> 39:58.959
What the BLEEP was that?

39:58.960 --> 40:02.918
Now, Jez has stopped at the side of
the road, hang on, something is up.

40:02.919 --> 40:06.360
Jezza's been hit, I think,
probably by a stone into his window.

40:06.361 --> 40:08.759
Stone in through your window?

40:08.760 --> 40:11.440
Something has just blown up
in there.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.760
What the BLEEP was it?

40:16.880 --> 40:19.840
That... Is it an airbag?
The airbag has gone off.

40:19.841 --> 40:24.519
Look, the smoke's still pouring
out of it. Is that the airbag?

40:24.520 --> 40:27.720
Yes, the airbag just went off.
There was a massive flash...

40:27.721 --> 40:30.039
That is really weird! My ear.

40:30.040 --> 40:32.078
I was saying this road
is so rough it's going

40:32.079 --> 40:34.998
to set the airbags off,
I said that just a few miles back.

40:34.999 --> 40:37.840
Well, I have never seen that.
No, me neither.

40:41.040 --> 40:42.720
Phwoar!

40:44.520 --> 40:46.400
Now I'm worried about this one.

40:48.000 --> 40:51.880
'By now we'd had enough
and wanted to stop for the night,

40:51.881 --> 40:55.439
'but this was dusk on the Serengeti.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.399
'Feeding time for the wildlife.

40:58.400 --> 41:01.760
'So we had to reach a safe camp
that was 30 miles away -

41:01.761 --> 41:05.520
'30 miles that
turned into a massacre.'

41:09.880 --> 41:11.640
Dear. Shot to bits.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.520
Have you got any more fronts?
Yes, I've got one more.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.759
That was new three minutes ago.

41:24.760 --> 41:27.320
Three minutes later I've
got a flat on the front.

41:33.040 --> 41:34.959
We've lost another one.

41:34.960 --> 41:38.959
This road is beyond belief
for killing cars.

41:38.960 --> 41:43.159
'It was inevitable, really,
that eventually one of us

41:43.160 --> 41:46.320
'would suffer some damage
that was slightly more serious

41:46.321 --> 41:47.560
'than a puncture.'

41:48.720 --> 41:51.679
My God. You are in big trouble.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.800
That one is straight, and
if you come around the other side,

41:54.801 --> 41:56.519
that's on full-left.

41:56.520 --> 42:00.399
You've broken a track rod
steering... My God.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.638
You can see the wishbone... there.

42:02.639 --> 42:07.078
If you look in there you'll see
the end of it, where it's... gone.

42:07.079 --> 42:09.878
Is it sheared? Yes. It is
completely sheared off.

42:09.879 --> 42:11.560
That might have killed my car.

42:13.320 --> 42:17.560
What's up? He's got a puncture.
He's also got a sheared wishbone.

42:17.561 --> 42:19.360
You're kidding. I'm not.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.800
That's a game over, isn't it?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.318
'The next morning, in our safe camp,

42:37.319 --> 42:39.960
'we counted up the toll
from Death Road.'

42:42.600 --> 42:45.760
I had three punctures,
one of which I have still got.

42:45.761 --> 42:47.759
Two airbags went off,

42:47.760 --> 42:51.519
both of which deafened me
and gave me heart attacks.

42:51.520 --> 42:54.760
What else - all four shock
absorbers are completely ruined.

42:54.761 --> 42:56.799
Yours any better?

42:56.800 --> 43:00.238
Well, I had two punctures,
the fuel line came off,

43:00.239 --> 43:02.038
the front bumper collapsed,

43:02.039 --> 43:04.398
I am not even bothering
to look at my shocks,

43:04.399 --> 43:07.678
because I know they were
absolutely shot, shot absorbers,

43:07.679 --> 43:11.118
but on the plus side, all
the bits that attach the wheels

43:11.119 --> 43:12.520
to the car are intact.

43:13.560 --> 43:15.799
Speaking of which...

43:15.800 --> 43:17.639
actually, where is he?

43:26.040 --> 43:29.760
These are the remnants of the point
at which the track control arm went,

43:29.761 --> 43:33.759
and you can see it was just
rotten from the inside out.

43:33.760 --> 43:37.158
It was going to go at some point,
and when it did collapse,

43:37.159 --> 43:40.320
it took the anti-roll bar
out on the way past.

43:40.321 --> 43:44.639
So, the only option is,
and it is quite a long shot -

43:44.640 --> 43:46.239
this is all useless -

43:46.240 --> 43:49.358
is to use the remainder of the
track control arm that's under

43:49.359 --> 43:50.760
there attached to the hub,

43:50.761 --> 43:55.480
and use this to fabricate and weld
on replacement bits for that.

44:00.200 --> 44:03.120
'At times like this,
the procedure is clear.

44:03.121 --> 44:05.639
'We do leave a man behind.

44:05.640 --> 44:09.359
'But, because we'd come
so far together, and because

44:09.360 --> 44:15.079
'we hadn't had breakfast yet, James
and I decided to bend the rules.'

44:15.080 --> 44:16.920
We'll give him till 11 o'clock.

44:18.320 --> 44:19.559
Fair enough.

44:19.560 --> 44:21.918
That's an hour and ten minutes.
Fair enough.

44:21.919 --> 44:24.278
What time did we get in last night,
about two?

44:24.279 --> 44:26.478
Something like that,
it went on for ever.

44:26.479 --> 44:28.760
Look at what I just slept in,
look at it!

44:30.600 --> 44:32.760
I mean look at the... Thank you

44:43.280 --> 44:45.959
'At exactly three minutes past 11,

44:45.960 --> 44:49.398
'James and I were parked on the main
road by the camp, waiting to see

44:49.399 --> 44:51.680
'whether we would finish
this journey as a twosome,

44:51.681 --> 44:53.880
'or a threesome.'

44:54.960 --> 44:58.440
Hammond is making a bit of a habit
of this on these adventures, now.

44:58.441 --> 45:01.359
Bolivia, his leg fell off. Oliver.

45:01.360 --> 45:04.118
Oliver? Didn't it make it?
Can't remember.

45:04.119 --> 45:06.718
It did, but we had to wait for
it... Yes, for days and days.

45:06.719 --> 45:08.760
..while he put it back together.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.159
Hang on!

45:15.160 --> 45:17.839
Do you hear that? I can, just.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.999
Is that soundtrack of
an approaching moron,

45:21.000 --> 45:23.319
or is it our support truck?

45:23.320 --> 45:26.119
With his silly little face
at the wheel.

45:26.120 --> 45:29.399
What is coming over the hill?

45:29.400 --> 45:33.680
Please let it be a lorry,
please let it be a lorry.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.960
We can't be... No. Pretend to be
pleased, pretend to be pleased!

45:39.961 --> 45:41.239
Pleased face!

45:41.240 --> 45:43.520
Great, we're all back together
as a team,

45:43.521 --> 45:45.639
right, good, here we go.

45:45.640 --> 45:51.039
Well done, mate. Yes, well done!
Ha-ha-ha! Are you impressed? Yes.

45:51.040 --> 45:54.358
We're impressed that
you're impressed. That's nice.

45:54.359 --> 45:57.880
That looks tremendous. Anyway,
Hammond, while you've been gone,

45:57.881 --> 46:01.919
James and I have made
a bit of a decision. What?

46:01.920 --> 46:05.118
The source of our river
is somewhere up there, OK?

46:05.119 --> 46:07.358
Now, only one of us
can technically get there first -

46:07.359 --> 46:09.638
they'll be the one
who's remembered, the other two

46:09.639 --> 46:12.520
will be forgotten, because nobody
remembers who comes second.

46:12.521 --> 46:16.359
So, we propose a race. Yes.

46:16.360 --> 46:17.839
Three, two, one - go!

46:17.840 --> 46:20.238
And whoever finds the source first -

46:20.239 --> 46:23.318
into the history books,
buried in Westminster Abbey.

46:23.319 --> 46:25.398
They dig up Livingstone,
throw him away,

46:25.399 --> 46:26.598
"You got it wrong..."

46:26.599 --> 46:28.400
You don't have to be buried
immediately?

46:28.401 --> 46:30.439
No, no, when you die.

46:30.440 --> 46:33.518
So, are we ready? The producers are
on the other side of that river.

46:33.519 --> 46:36.000
You can shout "Go!"
I'll do it on my tannoy system.

46:36.001 --> 46:38.880
Are we ready, gentlemen? I am ready.

46:42.360 --> 46:45.039
This is for everything.

46:45.040 --> 46:49.440
The greatest race in the history
of mankind is about to begin.

46:50.640 --> 46:53.600
Three, two, one - GO!

46:56.000 --> 46:57.560
Power, etc.

47:01.160 --> 47:04.160
Where is Jeremy? What was he doing?

47:06.200 --> 47:09.960
Have they learned nothing from
last night? Because I did!

47:09.961 --> 47:12.120
Speed causes punctures.

47:13.880 --> 47:16.478
17 miles an hour,
that's what you need.

47:16.479 --> 47:19.158
I don't want a puncture,
I want to win this,

47:19.159 --> 47:21.318
because this is a race for glory.

47:21.319 --> 47:23.480
The winner will go
in the history books,

47:23.481 --> 47:26.159
the losers will be quietly
forgotten,

47:26.160 --> 47:29.360
and they will end up opening
a shoe shop, probably, in Durham.

47:32.120 --> 47:36.919
'Top Gear's ARU had found an area
of hilly terrain 12 miles to

47:36.920 --> 47:41.679
'the east, where we believed we
would find the source of the Nile.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.320
'Getting there first mattered.'

47:46.200 --> 47:49.518
Richard Hammond hot on my tail,
in the quest for the source

47:49.519 --> 47:51.560
of the Nile,
with his repaired suspension.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.399
This is as fast as I dare go.

47:58.400 --> 47:59.839
Ooooh!

48:02.720 --> 48:06.038
The car has just undergone major
surgery, I have just closed

48:06.039 --> 48:08.840
the patient's chest, and
I'm forcing him to play rugby.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.318
If Richard Hammond beats me
in this race,

48:13.319 --> 48:15.320
he will be knighted by the Queen.

48:15.321 --> 48:17.719
She will say, "Arise, Sir Richard."

48:17.720 --> 48:19.680
You already have.

48:22.920 --> 48:24.600
Where the hell is Jeremy?

48:29.240 --> 48:32.358
This James May-Christian motoring
isn't working,

48:32.359 --> 48:34.920
they're not getting punctures.
I'm going to revert to type.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.200
I am a one-man dust machine.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.680
Hammond is going for it,
he's making a move!

48:54.240 --> 48:55.720
Ha-ha-ha!

48:58.720 --> 49:02.199
'For the next few miles,
we jostled for the lead.'

49:02.200 --> 49:04.239
Urgh, it's neck and neck.

49:04.240 --> 49:07.040
No!

49:09.440 --> 49:12.759
I'm going left,
I'm going to do it. Ooooh!

49:12.760 --> 49:14.599
Ha-ha-ha!

49:14.600 --> 49:16.320
Ooh!

49:17.640 --> 49:19.000
This!

49:20.320 --> 49:22.800
There they are, I'm catching.

49:25.200 --> 49:28.920
A warning light has come on
to say my car needs a service.

49:30.720 --> 49:33.359
Oooh! Oooh! This is just...

49:33.360 --> 49:35.360
killing my car.

49:38.440 --> 49:41.440
'We were now in the area
where the source should be,

49:41.441 --> 49:44.599
'so we needed to go
off-road to find it.'

49:44.600 --> 49:47.639
We're going to have to go
right somewhere.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.760
Hold on, hold on, what's this?

49:49.761 --> 49:51.800
There!

49:53.480 --> 49:55.400
Come on!

49:57.400 --> 49:59.480
Bugger Clarkson!

50:01.520 --> 50:05.759
Yeaaah! What do you think
of that? Ha-ha!

50:05.760 --> 50:07.880
Westminster Abbey is mine.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.760
'As the plain opened out,
we realised that in normal racing,

50:13.761 --> 50:17.120
'people tend to know where
the finish line is.'

50:19.840 --> 50:21.519
Which way, which way?

50:21.520 --> 50:26.160
'But we had to rely on
intelligence and cunning.'

50:27.680 --> 50:32.039
Right, trees, trees all
growing along a little valley,

50:32.040 --> 50:34.759
that can only mean river.

50:34.760 --> 50:37.278
That is a valley,
I'm not heading down into there,

50:37.279 --> 50:40.120
the source of the Nile isn't going
to be in a valley.

50:41.800 --> 50:45.200
Ha! Uphill, you see.
Uphill is good.

50:48.200 --> 50:50.920
I've totally lost my bearings here,
totally lost.

50:54.600 --> 50:57.160
Hang on a minute!

50:58.160 --> 51:00.159
This looks...

51:00.160 --> 51:02.680
This looks like a stream.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.119
It's going downhill that way.

51:06.120 --> 51:08.079
So I follow it up...

51:08.080 --> 51:10.640
and the source is in those rocks.

51:13.760 --> 51:16.040
It has to be. Yeah!

51:21.040 --> 51:23.439
Rocks. Many rocks.

51:23.440 --> 51:25.320
That is the sort of magical place

51:25.321 --> 51:28.520
I anticipate finding
the source of the Nile.

51:32.240 --> 51:35.720
There's a bit there moving, so
it's that way. Right, here we go.

51:38.080 --> 51:39.638
It's got to be this way,

51:39.639 --> 51:42.240
and Clarkson clearly has
the same idea.

51:44.040 --> 51:46.519
'And so did Hammond.'

51:49.560 --> 51:52.320
Can you imagine children
of the future learning in history

51:52.321 --> 51:55.239
lessons about Sir Richard Hammond?

51:55.240 --> 51:57.280
Nobody wants to think of that.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.080
'Because only one of us
could achieve

52:01.081 --> 52:05.479
'immortality in the history books,
things soon got a bit ugly.'

52:05.480 --> 52:07.239
Hammond's attacking him!

52:08.560 --> 52:10.599
Get off!

52:10.600 --> 52:12.880
Ha-ha-ha! I'm through.

52:15.720 --> 52:19.280
Hammond is properly in my way now,
he really is annoying me.

52:19.281 --> 52:24.039
I know how I can get Hammond
out of the way...

52:27.960 --> 52:30.600
God! Not that!

52:34.360 --> 52:35.720
I'm Genesis-ing him!

52:37.400 --> 52:38.759
Aaaagh!

52:38.760 --> 52:42.079
'Sadly, though, Genesis didn't work.

52:42.080 --> 52:43.599
'So I rammed him.'

52:45.240 --> 52:47.520
What?!

52:48.640 --> 52:50.680
I'm in the lead again!

52:55.080 --> 52:56.639
Whoa! Whoa!

52:56.640 --> 52:59.800
This Volvo is so far
out of its comfort zone.

53:05.720 --> 53:08.000
I'm going to go down in history!

53:11.960 --> 53:13.440
Everything tells me this is...

53:13.441 --> 53:18.839
it's the highest ground for miles
around - it's got to be in there,

53:18.840 --> 53:21.040
it's got to be in there.

53:24.680 --> 53:26.480
Aaaaagh!

53:28.240 --> 53:32.199
But there can be no more than
a few hundred meters now,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.320
we can afford to take a few knocks.

53:36.480 --> 53:38.159
Whoa!

53:38.160 --> 53:40.480
James, your suspension has collapsed.

53:40.481 --> 53:45.400
Your back wheel is coming off,
I'm not joking. Ha-ha-ha!

53:47.120 --> 53:49.920
My car has collapsed.
I'm going on foot.

53:51.400 --> 53:53.359
'As now were Richard and I.'

53:53.360 --> 53:56.758
End of the road for you, old friend.
I'll tell you what it's like.

53:56.759 --> 53:57.920
I'm off.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.599
It's geology, Jeremy, geology.

54:13.600 --> 54:17.638
What have we got here? We've got
bedrock, the ground is sunk down,

54:17.639 --> 54:20.840
indicating the presence
of a spring, in my mind.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.120
Lizards.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.879
Look at it. A stream has done this.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.120
But where is the source?

55:01.720 --> 55:05.320
This has been wet. Wait...

55:06.360 --> 55:10.359
This is soggy. This is soggy.

55:10.360 --> 55:16.120
This could be a stream. It is
a stream I'm walking up, it is.

55:20.280 --> 55:22.120
BLEEP Hammond is not having this!

55:28.240 --> 55:31.360
It goes downhill, that doesn't
mean it starts at the top.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.799
Wait!

55:35.800 --> 55:37.039
Wait!

55:37.040 --> 55:39.040
Is it?

55:40.720 --> 55:41.880
No.

55:41.881 --> 55:43.920
Here?

55:45.600 --> 55:48.199
That... Yes.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.479
Yes!

55:50.480 --> 55:52.719
Sorry, mate! That was close.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.799
Hammond!

55:54.800 --> 55:57.838
Well done. That is
the source of the River Nile.

55:57.839 --> 56:00.800
I'm going to put my finger
in it, excuse me.

56:02.320 --> 56:03.758
That is the root of civilization,

56:03.759 --> 56:06.320
that nourished the ancient
Egyptians. What, your finger?

56:06.321 --> 56:08.479
No, not my finger, the water.

56:08.480 --> 56:14.519
That's going to nourish the Sudan,
Egypt, Greece, Italy, Spain.

56:14.520 --> 56:19.320
Morocco, Algeria. That water is
the lifeblood of all of it.

56:20.840 --> 56:26.119
So, that is the undisputed source
of the River Nile,

56:26.120 --> 56:29.519
that is the man who found it,

56:29.520 --> 56:31.599
and somewhere way down there

56:31.600 --> 56:34.799
is the ruined Volvo
that brought him here.

56:34.800 --> 56:39.919
We now have to claim this
little pond for Top Gear,

56:39.920 --> 56:42.440
so, just bear with me, while I...

56:44.120 --> 56:47.120
Is the Top Gear flag slightly
bigger than the Union Flag?

56:47.121 --> 56:48.719
Yes, that's right.

56:48.720 --> 56:51.758
Have we got this the right way up
this time, so we don't get...

56:51.759 --> 56:54.558
So, here's what I'm suggesting,
chaps - we plant the flags,

56:54.559 --> 56:58.040
and then we do what all great
Victorian explorers did,

56:58.041 --> 57:01.280
pose for a photograph
by our discovery.

57:03.320 --> 57:05.280
Wait for the birdie!

57:05.287 --> 57:06.927
Three, two, one!
