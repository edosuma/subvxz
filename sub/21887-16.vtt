WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:01.801
<i>Previously on Gotham...</i>

00:01.845 --> 00:04.598
We could've had a good thing, you and I.

00:07.669 --> 00:08.768
You.

00:08.836 --> 00:10.502
Yeah.

00:10.604 --> 00:11.704
Me.

00:11.806 --> 00:14.440
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna confess.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.308
My connection to Sofia,

00:16.410 --> 00:18.310
- all of it.
- No.

00:18.412 --> 00:19.545
You want to pay your debt,

00:19.647 --> 00:20.579
you live with it.

00:20.681 --> 00:22.481
It's what the city needs.

00:22.583 --> 00:24.550
When I brought you
back to life, I asked you

00:24.652 --> 00:26.618
to be my eyes and ears in Gotham.

00:26.721 --> 00:29.421
You became so much more.

00:29.523 --> 00:30.622
Let her go now.

00:30.725 --> 00:32.725
No! I'll never go with you!

00:32.827 --> 00:34.493
No!

00:34.595 --> 00:37.329
You killed her!

00:37.431 --> 00:39.565
So now, you're going to return it?

00:39.667 --> 00:40.599
What am I supposed to say?

00:40.701 --> 00:42.886
"I stole your jewelry. Sorry."

00:42.887 --> 00:46.372
- Sometimes that's enough.
- Can you do it?

00:46.474 --> 00:47.539
- Migraines, still?
- It's like I've been

00:47.641 --> 00:49.842
hit in the head with a brick.

00:55.549 --> 00:56.815
You could escape any time.

00:56.917 --> 00:58.350
You're planning something.

00:58.452 --> 00:59.418
Something...

00:59.520 --> 01:01.387
spectacular!

01:01.489 --> 01:03.422
But when we're done,

01:03.524 --> 01:07.626
the world out there...
that'll be the asylum.

03:10.518 --> 03:12.518
Knock, knock, called the cock.

03:12.620 --> 03:16.522
Time to rise and wield your scythe.

03:20.261 --> 03:21.360
I fear

03:21.462 --> 03:24.229
I will require a moment more, Mr. Tetch.

03:24.332 --> 03:27.299
Our moment is fleeting,
my dear Mr. Crane,

03:27.401 --> 03:29.568
its wings desperately beating.

03:42.650 --> 03:46.285
There now, scarcely a drop spilled.

03:47.555 --> 03:50.489
Shall we, Mr. Tetch?

03:50.591 --> 03:54.293
Let us be at pains, Mr. Crane.

04:12.646 --> 04:16.115
When I say "three hairs past
a freckle," gentlemen,

04:16.216 --> 04:19.517
I do not mean "five hairs past."

04:19.620 --> 04:21.452
Let's do better next time, hmm?

04:21.555 --> 04:23.188
Mind both Ps and Qs,

04:23.290 --> 04:24.390
Valeska.

04:24.492 --> 04:27.459
We are not your militia
to be becked and called.

04:27.561 --> 04:30.429
I dread to think where you'd be

04:30.531 --> 04:32.131
without us.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.332
Boys, boys, let's, um,

04:33.434 --> 04:37.169
not squabble too early
in our partnership.

04:37.271 --> 04:39.138
There will be plenty of time
to stab each other

04:39.240 --> 04:41.140
in the backs later. But for now,

04:41.242 --> 04:42.341
stick to Jerome's plan,

04:42.443 --> 04:45.210
and everyone will get what they want.

04:45.312 --> 04:46.412
- Ah.
- An earthly

04:46.514 --> 04:49.248
kingdom of terror.

04:49.350 --> 04:52.151
A piece of Gotham pie,
both sky and high.

04:52.253 --> 04:54.186
That's the spirit, boys.

04:54.288 --> 04:57.589
Think big, and kinky.

04:57.691 --> 05:00.292
And lose the weirdo.

05:00.394 --> 05:03.095
She's giving me the heebie jeebies.

05:03.197 --> 05:05.364
Your work is done, my dear,

05:05.466 --> 05:07.199
your race all run.

05:07.301 --> 05:09.168
Glad to be of help.

05:16.444 --> 05:18.210
Much better.

05:18.312 --> 05:23.282
Now, to free the rest of our
cronies and blow this pop stand.

05:35.229 --> 05:38.530
There he goes, there he goes.

05:57.685 --> 06:00.185
Onward, march!

06:20.241 --> 06:22.341
Sure you're up for this, Captain Gordon?

06:22.443 --> 06:23.542
I'll manage.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.444
Picked a hell of a night
to come back on the job.

06:25.546 --> 06:27.379
- How many got out?
- Eighty seven.

06:27.481 --> 06:29.281
The entire violent ward.

06:29.383 --> 06:31.283
Yeah, we've rounded up most
of the serious nutjobs,

06:31.385 --> 06:33.485
they're the guys that think
they're walruses and whatnot.

06:33.587 --> 06:35.354
"Ephram Snow, child murderer;

06:35.456 --> 06:37.389
"Daedalus Boch, mutilator;

06:37.491 --> 06:40.526
Erasmus Rayne, cult killer,"
all at large.

06:40.628 --> 06:43.228
Surviving guards think your
old buddy Tetch was behind it.

06:43.330 --> 06:46.565
No. This big? This insane?

06:46.667 --> 06:48.400
Jerome Valeska put this together.

06:48.502 --> 06:50.369
And there'll be more to come.

06:50.471 --> 06:54.239
Got a lot of nervous cops out
here tonight who are thinking

06:54.341 --> 06:56.108
along the same lines.

06:56.210 --> 06:59.177
And I know what you're thinking.

06:59.280 --> 07:01.280
Why not tell them the truth?

07:01.382 --> 07:03.282
About Sofia, and the Pyg.

07:03.384 --> 07:05.284
Get it all out in the open.

07:05.386 --> 07:07.239
I've kept my mouth shut
like you told me to.

07:07.240 --> 07:10.222
Good. I'm telling you again: don't slip.

07:10.324 --> 07:14.293
Go over there and be big
Jim Gordon, hero cop.

07:14.395 --> 07:16.128
It's what they need.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.462
Even if it is a lie.

07:22.236 --> 07:24.236
- Looking good, Cap.
- Glad to see you, sir.

07:24.338 --> 07:26.138
Look who's back on the beat.
Welcome back, Captain.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.340
- Hey, back at it.
- Hey, good to see you, boss.

07:28.442 --> 07:30.409
All right, listen up.

07:32.513 --> 07:35.180
If I'd have known I'd be seeing
your ugly mugs tonight,

07:35.282 --> 07:37.182
I'd have stayed in the hospital.

07:37.284 --> 07:41.286
Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane,
Jerome Valeska.

07:41.388 --> 07:43.555
Each of these madmen has wreaked
a different kind of havoc

07:43.657 --> 07:45.090
on our city.

07:45.192 --> 07:46.391
Now they're on the loose,

07:46.493 --> 07:49.227
and presumably working together,
along with several dozen

07:49.330 --> 07:50.462
other garden-variety psychopaths.

07:50.564 --> 07:52.264
Know their M.O.s,

07:52.366 --> 07:54.232
their associates, their home turf.

07:54.335 --> 07:56.401
Gotham needs you tonight.

07:56.503 --> 07:59.304
Have each other's backs,
and we'll get through this.

07:59.406 --> 08:02.074
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

08:02.176 --> 08:04.109
All right.

08:04.211 --> 08:06.278
- Captain Gordon.
<i>- Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim,</i>

08:06.380 --> 08:08.447
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

08:08.549 --> 08:10.415
Why so grim, Jim?

08:10.517 --> 08:11.450
Tetch.

08:12.419 --> 08:13.485
What do you want?

08:13.587 --> 08:15.053
I'm not playing any of your games.

08:15.155 --> 08:16.254
No games this time.

08:16.357 --> 08:17.489
Just some maims,
and your own share of blames

08:17.591 --> 08:19.391
if you don't do what I tell you.

08:19.493 --> 08:23.195
To wit, James, find your way
to Witt Street and James Way.

08:23.297 --> 08:26.298
Do it, or I'm gonna kill someone!

08:26.400 --> 08:29.267
In case you had any doubts.

08:29.370 --> 08:32.104
- It's a setup.
- It's also our chance to catch him.

08:32.206 --> 08:34.172
If we can get Tetch,
he could lead us to Valeska.

08:34.274 --> 08:35.177
I'll put a squad together,

08:35.201 --> 08:36.342
- they can come up behind...
- No.

08:36.342 --> 08:38.309
The force is spread too thin
looking for the escapees.

08:39.546 --> 08:40.544
Let's go.

08:40.648 --> 08:43.347
You sure?

08:43.450 --> 08:46.284
You said we had to have each
other's backs tonight, right?

08:46.387 --> 08:48.253
I'm following orders, Captain.

09:00.467 --> 09:02.267
I had a thought.

09:02.369 --> 09:03.435
I'll alert the press.

09:03.537 --> 09:05.337
What if we're hypnotized?

09:05.439 --> 09:06.405
What?

09:06.507 --> 09:08.140
Stick with me here.

09:08.242 --> 09:10.175
We both listened to Tetch on the phone.

09:10.277 --> 09:12.411
What if he hypno'd us
into coming down here alone?

09:12.513 --> 09:14.279
That would be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

09:14.381 --> 09:17.282
So what, we're either idiots,
or we're hypnotized?

09:17.384 --> 09:19.418
Good choices.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.188
You did a good job
with the troops back there.

09:23.290 --> 09:24.289
Thanks.

09:24.391 --> 09:25.424
This is Witt Street.

09:25.526 --> 09:27.259
Lights out.

09:29.363 --> 09:31.329
What the hell?

09:42.476 --> 09:45.444
We got to get them out of there.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.451
No, don't shoot, they're
hypnotized, they're hypnotized,

09:52.553 --> 09:54.352
- don't shoot.
- Back off!

09:54.455 --> 09:56.121
All right, buddy, come on.

09:56.223 --> 09:57.355
Hey.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.157
Lo and behold!

09:59.259 --> 10:01.293
The bold Captain Jim Gordon,

10:01.395 --> 10:03.395
and his rusty caboose in tow.

10:03.497 --> 10:05.263
You have us, Tetch.

10:05.365 --> 10:06.565
- Let them go.
- Do you recall

10:06.667 --> 10:10.569
when I first came
to this fair city, Jim?

10:10.671 --> 10:16.208
A bawling mess, wanting nothing
more than to address the safety

10:16.310 --> 10:18.110
of my dear sister Alice?

10:18.212 --> 10:19.478
What's the choice this time, Tetch?

10:19.580 --> 10:21.179
How do I save them?

10:21.281 --> 10:22.380
Just tell me what you want.

10:22.483 --> 10:26.184
What I want is my sister back!

10:26.286 --> 10:27.419
But you

10:27.521 --> 10:30.388
kept me from saving her.

10:32.426 --> 10:34.292
You gave me no choice!

10:35.362 --> 10:37.496
So no more choices for you, either.

10:39.466 --> 10:41.600
No more saving.

10:45.339 --> 10:46.238
No!

10:50.444 --> 10:53.345
Soon the bells will toll, Jim.

10:53.447 --> 10:56.148
How many more will grow cold, Jim?

10:56.250 --> 10:57.315
Like your soul, Jim.

10:57.417 --> 10:59.251
How many

10:59.353 --> 11:02.420
would-be fliers will be die-rs?!

11:02.523 --> 11:06.324
Splattered like my poor, spitted Alice

11:06.426 --> 11:10.262
when the Gotham bells tolled
their full roll!

11:22.365 --> 11:25.954
You said you needed help,
but you didn't say anything

11:25.955 --> 11:28.189
about walking straight into the GCPD.

11:28.224 --> 11:31.159
You want to bail out now?

11:31.194 --> 11:33.161
No. I just want to make sure

11:33.196 --> 11:35.830
there's no jewelry debt.

11:35.865 --> 11:36.964
There's no debt.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.166
I helped to get the jewelry back

11:38.201 --> 11:39.901
- 'cause I want to help.
- Nobody does anything

11:39.936 --> 11:42.070
- just to help.
- Fine.

11:42.105 --> 11:43.171
Once this is over,
there'll be nothing left

11:43.206 --> 11:44.172
to settle between us.

11:44.207 --> 11:47.141
Can you do it?

11:51.147 --> 11:54.782
Okay.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.053
- Okay, got it. Which file?
- Jerome Valeska.

11:59.089 --> 12:00.722
There'll be a red Arkham stamp on it.

12:00.757 --> 12:02.056
Valeska? What do you want with that nut?

12:02.092 --> 12:03.157
He broke out of Arkham tonight.

12:03.193 --> 12:04.992
Yeah. What does that
have to do with you?

12:05.028 --> 12:07.161
Can you just get the file
before someone sees us?

12:13.069 --> 12:15.103
The largest single breach in security

12:15.138 --> 12:17.038
in the troubled history of Arkham Asylum

12:17.073 --> 12:20.108
has led to a citywide curfew
as many of the worst criminals

12:20.143 --> 12:24.712
who have ever plagued Gotham
flood the streets.

12:24.748 --> 12:27.849
27 deaths have been attributed
to the escapees...

12:27.884 --> 12:30.918
This city is going crazy pants.

12:30.954 --> 12:32.153
Can we turn that thing off?

12:32.188 --> 12:33.988
<i>Captain James Gordon...</i>

12:34.023 --> 12:35.790
We could be out there making a killing

12:35.825 --> 12:37.091
while the cops are rounding
up all these nutjobs.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.893
I am gonna go nuts

12:38.928 --> 12:41.829
if you don't turn that damn thing off!

12:41.865 --> 12:42.930
<i>Please be aware</i>

12:42.966 --> 12:44.799
<i>that these escapees
are extremely dangerous.</i>

12:47.137 --> 12:49.871
Another migraine?

12:49.906 --> 12:52.073
Nothing a little self-medication
won't fix.

12:52.108 --> 12:54.041
And your hand?

12:54.077 --> 12:56.144
Got a pill for that?

13:01.985 --> 13:04.752
I'll fix it. I've been reading

13:04.788 --> 13:07.755
ancient history, mysticism, philosophy,

13:07.791 --> 13:09.023
anything that might
reference Ra's al Ghul.

13:09.058 --> 13:11.692
I'm sick of hearing
that charlatan's name.

13:11.728 --> 13:13.861
He brought me back to life.

13:13.897 --> 13:15.163
We'd never even met.

13:15.198 --> 13:16.931
Why choose me?

13:16.966 --> 13:20.001
Aah!

13:20.036 --> 13:22.937
For all you know, he lied to you.

13:22.972 --> 13:24.772
Maybe he just told you you were dead.

13:24.808 --> 13:26.941
I mean, you can't even
remember what happened.

13:26.976 --> 13:29.143
It hurts to remember.

13:31.181 --> 13:34.115
What?

13:34.150 --> 13:38.119
The attacks I'm having...

13:38.154 --> 13:41.022
it's like memories are trying
to push their way into my brain,

13:41.057 --> 13:44.826
but when I go to touch them,
it's just this searing pain.

13:48.064 --> 13:49.897
You have to let them in.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.933
It hurts too much.

13:51.968 --> 13:55.837
- Listen to you whining like a little baby.
- What?

13:55.872 --> 13:57.939
You have been hiding here for weeks,

13:57.974 --> 13:59.740
reading these books and
now you're telling me

13:59.776 --> 14:01.108
you might have all the
answers in your head,

14:01.144 --> 14:03.110
but you don't want to get them
because it hurts too much?

14:03.146 --> 14:06.080
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:06.115 --> 14:08.749
No, I have no idea who I'm talking to.

14:08.785 --> 14:10.985
The Barbara I know wouldn't let
anything that she's afraid of

14:11.020 --> 14:12.820
stand in the way of what she wants.

14:12.856 --> 14:16.824
Not cops, not criminals,
not blood and not pain.

14:32.175 --> 14:35.142
I remember when it all went dark.

14:37.747 --> 14:42.817
There was this blinding, electric light

14:42.852 --> 14:45.152
and then...

14:45.188 --> 14:46.854
nothing.

14:49.859 --> 14:51.792
And then I remember.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.730
I remember.

14:56.933 --> 14:58.866
Aah!

15:01.771 --> 15:05.139
I know. I hear you.

15:05.174 --> 15:08.876
The world and its cruelties.

15:08.912 --> 15:11.679
How unfair it's been to you.

15:11.714 --> 15:13.781
I can hear you cursing it.

15:37.106 --> 15:40.775
Oh, what a vital, poisonous

15:40.810 --> 15:43.811
little mind you have.

15:43.846 --> 15:46.948
And yet, everybody hates you
for it, don't they?

15:49.018 --> 15:51.886
Yes.

15:51.921 --> 15:56.023
Everybody hates me.

15:56.059 --> 15:58.125
I don't know why.

15:58.161 --> 16:02.663
I understand that feeling
very well, Barbara.

16:02.699 --> 16:04.832
You...

16:04.867 --> 16:08.936
are just the one I've been looking for.

16:08.972 --> 16:10.871
And I have a present for you,

16:10.907 --> 16:13.007
but it's a secret.

16:13.042 --> 16:17.712
You shall become the Demon's Head.

16:19.082 --> 16:23.117
The League of Shadows
will be yours to command,

16:23.152 --> 16:28.122
an army of assassins.

16:28.157 --> 16:32.760
The world is weak, Barbara.

16:32.795 --> 16:35.763
And you are strong.

16:35.798 --> 16:39.800
Use the League to make the world

16:39.836 --> 16:43.738
more like you.

16:43.773 --> 16:46.707
Barbara. Barbara?

16:50.146 --> 16:53.681
I'm okay.

16:53.716 --> 16:57.852
Ra's just really...

16:57.887 --> 16:59.754
understood me.

16:59.789 --> 17:01.022
So you remembered something?

17:01.057 --> 17:02.123
Yeah.

17:02.158 --> 17:04.125
It's a beacon

17:04.160 --> 17:06.027
calling them here.

17:06.061 --> 17:07.862
And they're coming.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.130
Who?

17:11.166 --> 17:13.800
The League of Shadows.

17:14.871 --> 17:16.871
All right. Hey!

17:16.906 --> 17:18.138
Same story all around.

17:18.174 --> 17:19.906
Last thing they remember
is they were driving,

17:19.942 --> 17:21.742
then they were here and then it was

17:21.778 --> 17:23.144
cluck-cluck, here a
chick, there a chick.

17:23.179 --> 17:24.912
Any luck?

17:24.946 --> 17:26.113
Well, something bad's gonna happen

17:26.148 --> 17:27.748
and there's a time limit.

17:27.784 --> 17:28.983
That's "the Gotham bell's full roll."

17:29.018 --> 17:29.984
Midnight, right?

17:30.019 --> 17:31.085
That's less than an hour.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.153
What's the bad thing
that's gonna happen?

17:32.188 --> 17:34.155
I don't know. He's gonna
hypnotize more people?

17:34.190 --> 17:35.156
To do what?

17:35.191 --> 17:38.059
"Splatted like my spitted Alice."

17:38.094 --> 17:40.728
His sister Alice jumped, was impaled.

17:40.763 --> 17:44.031
"Fliers will become die-rs."

17:44.067 --> 17:45.700
They'll be "splatted."

17:47.837 --> 17:49.103
Oh, no.

17:49.138 --> 17:50.971
Yeah, yeah, come on.

18:09.025 --> 18:10.725
Come on.

18:13.863 --> 18:15.663
Bruce Wayne?

18:15.698 --> 18:17.732
What are you doing here?

18:17.767 --> 18:18.866
Detective Harper.

18:18.901 --> 18:20.868
Where is Captain Gordon?

18:20.903 --> 18:22.103
I need to see him.

18:22.138 --> 18:23.938
He's out on the Arkham break.

18:23.973 --> 18:25.106
What do you need?

18:26.142 --> 18:28.843
I need protection.

18:28.878 --> 18:30.911
Last year, I captured Jerome Valeska.

18:30.947 --> 18:33.948
He's clearly escaped so that
he can get his revenge on me.

18:33.983 --> 18:36.984
Okay, I think it's
a little bit more than that.

18:37.019 --> 18:39.153
I'm very close friends
with Captain Gordon.

18:39.188 --> 18:41.155
I am sure he wants me
to be well-protected.

18:41.190 --> 18:43.124
But if this is a matter of payment...

18:43.159 --> 18:44.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.826
Put that away.

18:45.862 --> 18:46.894
What do you, what do you want?

18:46.929 --> 18:48.062
A bribery charge?

18:48.097 --> 18:51.065
I-I just...

18:51.100 --> 18:52.833
I'm sorry. I just...

18:52.869 --> 18:56.737
I'm just, I'm just really scared.

18:56.773 --> 18:59.039
I know Valeska wants me dead.

18:59.075 --> 19:00.841
- I just know it.
- Take it easy, Wayne.

19:00.877 --> 19:02.743
All right? You-you can stay here.

19:02.779 --> 19:04.845
You'll be perfectly safe.

19:04.881 --> 19:05.946
Okay.

19:10.119 --> 19:12.720
All right, Wayne.

19:12.755 --> 19:14.655
Let's find you a seat.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.759
Hold on!

19:18.795 --> 19:19.994
We're gonna get you down.

19:20.029 --> 19:22.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tetch has them booby-trapped.

19:22.064 --> 19:23.764
If we get too close, they'll jump.

19:24.901 --> 19:26.834
But if we do nothing,
they jump at midnight.

19:27.870 --> 19:29.870
How did he get to all of them?

19:29.906 --> 19:31.972
And the drivers,
how did he hypnotize all of them?

19:32.008 --> 19:34.108
What's that matter?
We got to help these people.

19:34.143 --> 19:35.876
We got to put a net around the building.

19:37.814 --> 19:39.814
A net won't work, Harvey.

19:48.963 --> 19:51.130
Do you know this diner, Zach's?

19:51.232 --> 19:52.965
No. Why?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.900
Look, Valeska's uncle owns it.

19:55.002 --> 19:56.902
He might know where Jerome
would go after escaping.

19:57.004 --> 19:59.405
This still sounds like
a cop's job to me.

20:01.442 --> 20:05.110
I could've killed Jerome after
he kidnapped me and I didn't.

20:05.212 --> 20:09.181
Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.

20:09.283 --> 20:13.085
In a way, I'm responsible
for his life now.

20:13.187 --> 20:15.321
I can't just wait to see
what the cops'll do.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.023
I-I have to get him back to Arkham.

20:20.227 --> 20:22.194
What?

20:22.296 --> 20:26.065
Your ego, Bruce.

20:26.167 --> 20:28.033
It's huge.

20:28.135 --> 20:29.134
What?

20:29.236 --> 20:31.937
Not everything is your fault

20:32.039 --> 20:34.273
or your responsibility.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.942
Get over yourself.

20:37.044 --> 20:39.111
It'd make you a little easier
to be around.

20:56.197 --> 20:57.429
Thanks for the advice.

21:06.073 --> 21:08.307
You sure you don't need my help anymore?

21:08.409 --> 21:10.042
We're even?

21:10.144 --> 21:12.144
You don't owe me anything, Selina.

21:12.246 --> 21:14.113
You never did.

21:26.394 --> 21:28.027
And you're sure you haven't
heard from your nephew,

21:28.129 --> 21:30.329
- Mr. Trumble?
- That monster killed my sister.

21:30.431 --> 21:32.998
I ever see him, his screams
are what you'll be hearing.

21:33.100 --> 21:36.301
Just maybe give us a call
before things go that far.

21:43.044 --> 21:45.177
Geez, there's a lot of gum under here.

21:49.150 --> 21:51.984
You're lucky those flatfoots
didn't check under the table,

21:52.086 --> 21:53.352
Uncle Zach.

21:56.057 --> 21:58.090
I mean, got to be some kind
of health code violation

21:58.192 --> 21:59.425
or something.

22:02.430 --> 22:05.064
Jim, it's happening all over the city.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.299
Thousands are climbing up
on roofs, more every minute.

22:07.401 --> 22:10.135
Drivers, people at work,
in the streets, at home.

22:10.237 --> 22:12.037
How's he getting to them?

22:15.009 --> 22:16.008
Radio.

22:16.110 --> 22:17.309
He's broadcasting on radio.

22:17.411 --> 22:19.144
He must've taken over a radio station.

22:19.246 --> 22:21.280
Which one? We don't have time
to hit them all.

22:21.382 --> 22:22.347
The drivers who grabbed us.

22:22.450 --> 22:26.085
They were listening to the same station.

22:26.187 --> 22:28.287
- XDJN here.
- WYED.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.994
WEPV.

22:36.097 --> 22:37.996
They're all on different stations.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.098
He must've commanded
them to change the station

22:39.200 --> 22:40.232
so we couldn't find him.

22:42.436 --> 22:44.903
There's only one way to know
which one he's using.

22:45.005 --> 22:46.905
What are you doing?

22:47.007 --> 22:48.874
No, no, no, no, no. Harvey.

22:48.976 --> 22:51.343
Harvey. Hey! Harvey. Hey!

22:51.445 --> 22:54.046
- Hey!
- WYED, clear.

22:54.148 --> 22:56.181
- Harvey, no, let me go.
- KPIL.

22:56.283 --> 22:58.150
- That toilet paper jingle I love so much.
- No.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.284
I've got Tetch
out of my head once before.

22:59.386 --> 23:02.087
- I could do it again.
- XDNJ.

23:02.189 --> 23:04.323
- Ugh, it's that song I hate.
- Come on.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.391
Mmm.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.029
Too cold.

23:11.132 --> 23:13.098
Ah, too hot. Ah.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.001
Oh.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.402
Just right.

23:20.074 --> 23:23.108
Mmm. You always could
cook up a storm, Unc.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.110
I remember back in the circus,

23:25.212 --> 23:27.379
we used to dare each other
to sneak into the chuck wagon,

23:27.481 --> 23:30.115
steal one of your cookies or two.

23:30.217 --> 23:33.385
That reminds me of my
favorite meal you ever cooked.

23:35.189 --> 23:36.321
You remember that time you caught me

23:36.423 --> 23:38.090
trying to snag a snickerdoodle?

23:39.393 --> 23:42.094
Oh! That soup you made that day.

23:42.196 --> 23:45.164
Mmm. Mamma mia.

23:45.266 --> 23:47.900
What was the special ingredient again?

23:48.002 --> 23:49.968
Ah.

23:50.070 --> 23:53.038
Right. It was my hand.

23:54.275 --> 23:57.342
The one you dipped in
a boiling pot of chicken stock!

23:58.979 --> 24:02.080
That smell, it was...

24:03.417 --> 24:06.285
...mouthwatering.

24:09.123 --> 24:12.191
Almost as good as this. Mmm!

24:12.293 --> 24:13.358
That's a good story, nephew.

24:13.460 --> 24:16.962
But aren't you curious about the soup?

24:17.064 --> 24:18.297
Don't tell me it's poisoned.

24:18.399 --> 24:20.065
Not at all.

24:20.267 --> 24:22.234
Mmm.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.237
You had me worried there
for a second, Unc.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.472
I set out three bowls of soup, nephew,

24:27.574 --> 24:30.075
so I'd have enough for all my guests.

24:33.314 --> 24:35.247
Ah!

24:37.584 --> 24:40.319
You remember Lunkhead from his
strongman days at the circus?

24:40.421 --> 24:42.321
The minute I heard you broke out,

24:42.423 --> 24:44.089
I knew you'd be headed here,

24:44.191 --> 24:46.258
so I invited good old Lunk
for some supper.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.294
The "just right" soup is for him.

24:49.396 --> 24:50.996
The "cold" is for me.

24:51.098 --> 24:54.066
I always loved gazpacho.

24:54.168 --> 24:57.269
The "too hot," that's for you, nephew.

25:07.348 --> 25:10.148
I'm just saying, how could there
be a global army of assassins

25:10.250 --> 25:11.283
we've never heard of?

25:11.385 --> 25:14.119
What part of League of Shadows
do you not understand?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.188
- And they're coming here?
- To me.

25:16.290 --> 25:17.422
They're coming to me.

25:17.524 --> 25:19.091
Well, hell, Barb, shouldn't we

25:19.193 --> 25:21.026
be getting ready for them or something?

25:21.128 --> 25:22.227
Oh, I'm ready.

25:22.329 --> 25:24.329
Soon as they want to show themselves.

25:24.431 --> 25:26.164
What?

25:26.266 --> 25:29.134
You can stop hiding.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.137
I know you're there.

25:42.416 --> 25:45.250
We're here for the Demon's Head.

25:45.352 --> 25:47.319
Where is he?

25:49.423 --> 25:50.455
She...

25:51.458 --> 25:53.191
...is right here.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.200
- Harvey!
- Clear.

26:02.302 --> 26:04.169
WZPZ.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.071
<i>- ...of every tower...</i>
- Jim.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.006
- WZPZ...
- <i>throw yourselves</i>

26:08.108 --> 26:10.175
- <i>pell-mell, over the edge...</i>
- Stop listening.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.144
That's an order. You hear me?
Stop listening.

26:12.246 --> 26:13.412
WZPZ.

26:13.514 --> 26:15.480
Change the station. Come on,
Harvey, change the station.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.485
Whoa, whoa. Wait.

26:22.322 --> 26:23.321
Sorry, pal.

26:23.424 --> 26:25.090
There's something I got to do.

26:26.460 --> 26:30.128
Hickory, dickory, dock.
The copper went up the clock.

26:30.230 --> 26:32.064
The clock struck 12:00,
he fell pell-mell,

26:32.166 --> 26:34.099
and that was it for the cop.

26:39.782 --> 26:41.826
<i>- Gotham Central.</i>
- Harper, it's Gordon.

26:41.827 --> 26:44.577
Cap, it is crazy here.
I got seven cops ready to jump.

26:44.578 --> 26:46.711
I got, I got calls coming in
from everywhere.

26:46.713 --> 26:49.714
It's Tetch. He's broadcasting
from the WZPZ station.

26:49.816 --> 26:50.748
Okay, I'll redirect units.

26:50.850 --> 26:52.550
<i>No. I want all cars on the street</i>

26:52.652 --> 26:55.520
ready to amplify on
the emergency G911 band.

26:55.622 --> 26:57.488
Radio teams on as many roofs
as possible.

26:57.591 --> 27:00.525
- And then what?
- Wait for my signal.

27:14.808 --> 27:15.807
Wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

27:15.909 --> 27:17.609
No, no, no. No.

27:17.711 --> 27:19.811
Here, nephew,

27:19.913 --> 27:22.614
have a taste of one of
my three soups, huh?

27:22.716 --> 27:23.781
No, no, no.

27:25.652 --> 27:26.884
My sister had the wrong idea with you,

27:26.987 --> 27:28.653
keeping you around.

27:28.755 --> 27:31.522
She should've put you
in a sack with some rocks

27:31.625 --> 27:34.792
and dropped you in the river.

27:34.894 --> 27:37.562
Put this creep out of our misery.

27:38.632 --> 27:40.565
What the hell are you doing?

27:40.667 --> 27:42.500
Get out of here, kid.

27:42.602 --> 27:43.668
No.

27:43.770 --> 27:47.438
Look, kid, I appreciate
a concerned citizen and all,

27:47.540 --> 27:49.707
but this is Jerome Valeska,

27:49.809 --> 27:51.643
the psycho who broke out
of Arkham tonight.

27:51.745 --> 27:53.745
And what we're doing
is giving him what he deserves.

27:53.847 --> 27:54.912
No one deserves that.

27:55.015 --> 27:57.548
- You tell him.
- Shut up.

27:57.651 --> 27:58.683
Stop.

27:58.785 --> 28:00.818
Call the police,
and they'll come for him.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.721
Ah, geez.

28:03.823 --> 28:06.724
Let him go.

28:06.826 --> 28:07.959
And get rid of the kid.

28:18.004 --> 28:20.905
- Ah!
- Look what we left lying around.

28:21.007 --> 28:22.874
Enough reliving old
memories, Uncle Zach.

28:22.976 --> 28:25.743
Tell me what I want to know.
You know why I'm here.

28:25.845 --> 28:26.978
I don't know anything.

28:28.615 --> 28:29.814
It's too bad we're out of soup.

28:31.718 --> 28:34.886
I wonder what else is on the menu.

28:38.792 --> 28:40.625
She's got the mark of the Demon's Head.

28:41.561 --> 28:42.894
Ra's chose her.

28:42.996 --> 28:45.897
She doesn't even know what it is.

28:45.999 --> 28:48.599
I know it means
I'm your new damn leader.

28:48.702 --> 28:50.768
Is that all you think it is?

28:50.870 --> 28:52.704
Ra's didn't explain everything.

28:52.806 --> 28:54.539
Look at the mess he's left us with.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.474
You have the mark of the Demon's Head,

28:56.576 --> 28:57.675
but no woman has ever been allowed

28:57.777 --> 28:58.776
to lead the League of Shadows.

28:58.878 --> 29:00.778
I'm sorry, you just said what?

29:00.880 --> 29:04.615
Women serve in the League,
but they do not lead.

29:04.718 --> 29:07.819
That's not a law,
just a stupid tradition.

29:07.921 --> 29:08.986
Ra's chose her.

29:10.757 --> 29:12.790
We need to honor his choice.

29:12.892 --> 29:14.759
That's true.

29:14.861 --> 29:16.627
As long as you have the Demon's Head,

29:16.730 --> 29:17.762
the League must follow you.

29:17.864 --> 29:19.530
Now we're back on track.

29:19.632 --> 29:22.867
So I guess I'll have to cut
the Demon's Head from you.

29:30.944 --> 29:32.677
Anyone else want a shot at the title?

29:38.918 --> 29:42.487
Here comes the airplane.

29:42.589 --> 29:43.755
No, no, no, no, no.

29:43.857 --> 29:45.723
I'll tell you, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you. Look, look.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.526
She-she picked St. Ignatius.
The school is St. Ignatius.

29:48.628 --> 29:50.661
Got it. Lost it.

29:50.764 --> 29:51.863
Write it down.

30:01.074 --> 30:02.540
Thanks.

30:02.642 --> 30:04.609
It's been great catching up, Uncle Zach.

30:04.711 --> 30:06.677
You really brought back the
utter helplessness of childhood.

30:08.815 --> 30:10.681
Well, see you around.

30:10.784 --> 30:12.650
I mean, except the opposite.

30:17.090 --> 30:20.758
Boy billionaire, Bruce Wayne, my savior.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.594
Wow, I did not see that one coming.

30:26.099 --> 30:28.866
You know, with Uncle Zach,

30:28.968 --> 30:30.835
the beatings just never stopped.

30:30.937 --> 30:32.937
They went on and on.

30:33.039 --> 30:36.007
Yet, nobody ever helped me.

30:38.011 --> 30:40.511
Ever.

30:40.613 --> 30:41.879
Really makes a man wonder.

30:42.916 --> 30:46.617
What the hell is wrong with you?

30:48.688 --> 30:50.922
The only thing funnier
than you saving my life...

30:52.692 --> 30:54.559
- ...would be if I saved yours.
- No!

30:54.661 --> 30:57.962
Eh... no, wait.

30:58.064 --> 31:01.833
What would be funnier is if
you were choked to death

31:01.935 --> 31:03.835
by the guy that you saved me from.

31:03.937 --> 31:05.970
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll do that instead.

31:07.006 --> 31:08.005
Yeah, yeah, do your thing.

31:17.717 --> 31:19.817
Almost magic hour, Gothamites.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.787
Time to climb to the tippy-top
of every tower.

31:22.889 --> 31:26.724
When the bell strikes 12:00,
throw yourselves pell-mell,

31:26.826 --> 31:29.760
over the edge, onto your heads.

31:30.830 --> 31:32.663
Shut up, Tetch.

31:38.100 --> 31:39.299
This is Captain Gordon

31:39.335 --> 31:42.069
<i>of the GCPD. Am I coming through?</i>

31:42.104 --> 31:43.170
You're coming through.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.439
<i>They can hear you all over the city.</i>

31:45.474 --> 31:47.508
All right, Tetch,

31:47.543 --> 31:49.476
you're gonna tell those people
to step back from the ledge.

31:49.512 --> 31:50.511
No tricks.

31:50.546 --> 31:52.413
You go off script,

31:52.448 --> 31:55.282
and I'll shoot pieces off you
till you do what I say.

31:55.317 --> 32:01.288
I would love to do as you command, Jim.

32:01.323 --> 32:04.158
But sadly, I've tied my own hands.

32:04.193 --> 32:06.360
Your hands.

32:15.404 --> 32:17.538
I-I can't stop them.

32:17.573 --> 32:21.508
If anyone tells them to save themselves,

32:21.544 --> 32:24.144
they'll jump.

32:24.180 --> 32:26.346
But you're more than welcome
to try, Jim.

32:26.382 --> 32:30.084
Obey the next voice you hear!

32:30.119 --> 32:32.252
Tell them anything.

32:32.288 --> 32:34.488
It will not matter
when the bells start to ring.

32:34.523 --> 32:36.356
Your oh-so-callous caused the death

32:36.392 --> 32:38.292
of my darling Alice, Jim.

32:38.327 --> 32:41.462
Try, and they die.

32:41.497 --> 32:45.199
Stand by, and they all try to fly.

32:47.236 --> 32:48.268
Cap?

32:50.206 --> 32:53.474
Cap, what do we do? How do we save them?

32:57.079 --> 32:59.513
I, uh... I could watch
this all night, Bruce.

33:14.196 --> 33:15.496
Hands off, big boy.

33:20.269 --> 33:23.003
Still don't need my help, Bruce?

33:23.038 --> 33:24.037
Selina.

33:25.074 --> 33:27.307
Selina, huh?

33:27.343 --> 33:30.144
Well, isn't that a nice name.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.281
- Selina...
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:34.316 --> 33:37.451
She's not that kind of girl.

33:37.486 --> 33:40.154
Wrong answer, freak.

33:40.189 --> 33:42.022
Uh, that's funny, 'cause...

33:45.361 --> 33:47.227
Whoa, that was a close one!

33:51.066 --> 33:52.132
Oh, all right.

33:52.168 --> 33:55.135
See you crazy kids later. Ciao!

33:58.407 --> 34:01.141
You should have let me shoot him.

34:04.213 --> 34:07.114
It would have been over by now.

34:07.149 --> 34:10.417
Selina, I told you
I'm responsible for him.

34:10.452 --> 34:13.187
I can't just let him
be shot, Selina, I can't.

34:13.222 --> 34:16.223
I'm not taking responsibility
for this mess.

34:16.257 --> 34:19.525
So let's get out of here
before the cops show up. Yeah?

34:22.097 --> 34:23.163
Come on.

34:26.502 --> 34:28.302
It's not over yet.

34:32.440 --> 34:34.408
Hey, suit yourself.

34:37.246 --> 34:40.147
Just don't take...

34:40.181 --> 34:43.317
so much responsibility
that you get yourself killed.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.276
Some legacy your
dead boyfriend left you.

35:09.311 --> 35:10.277
No.

35:10.312 --> 35:12.479
Ra's chose me for a reason,

35:12.514 --> 35:14.081
I know it.

35:22.291 --> 35:24.191
You're weak.

35:25.394 --> 35:29.062
You're all so damn weak.

35:29.098 --> 35:31.265
That's it.

35:31.300 --> 35:34.301
That is why Ra's chose me.

35:34.336 --> 35:39.206
Because he knew I would see
how pitiful you all are.

35:39.241 --> 35:42.242
Afraid of change.

35:42.278 --> 35:47.047
Afraid to take orders from a woman.

35:47.082 --> 35:48.448
Well, listen up.

35:48.484 --> 35:52.219
I am the Demon's Head,
so you sons of bitches

35:52.254 --> 35:55.055
better start bowing down right now,

35:55.090 --> 35:58.292
or it's gonna get ugly up in here.

36:24.386 --> 36:26.386
You're right. They were weak.

36:26.422 --> 36:28.455
And the mission of the League of Shadows

36:28.490 --> 36:30.424
is to cull weakness.

36:30.459 --> 36:32.459
They were unfit and needed to die.

36:32.494 --> 36:37.331
But the sisters of the League
are yours to command.

36:37.366 --> 36:40.400
Well, it's not much
of a league now, is it?

36:40.436 --> 36:44.304
We're the point of the spear, Barbara.

36:44.340 --> 36:46.006
Hundreds will follow you.

36:48.210 --> 36:49.376
What the hell?

36:49.411 --> 36:52.045
You have no idea
what they expect from you.

36:52.081 --> 36:55.315
This is mine, Tabitha,
and I'm taking it.

37:00.356 --> 37:03.156
Tell me what I need to know.

37:13.469 --> 37:16.136
Cap, what do we do?

37:23.011 --> 37:24.978
I can't save you.

37:30.486 --> 37:32.185
Save each other.

37:32.221 --> 37:34.287
<i>Save each other.</i>

37:34.323 --> 37:37.391
<i>Save each other.</i>

37:49.138 --> 37:51.004
It worked.

37:51.039 --> 37:53.473
It worked. They're stepping away.

37:53.509 --> 37:56.376
What?

37:56.412 --> 37:58.145
- What happened?
- I got you, I got you.

38:04.219 --> 38:06.186
Thank you.

38:32.078 --> 38:35.046
Heard we got nothing from Tetch
about Valeska's plans.

38:35.081 --> 38:38.382
Not a word the whole time the
medics were patching him up.

38:38.418 --> 38:41.111
Still, 40 escapees back in the can,

38:41.211 --> 38:44.288
and a lot of people with their
feet safely on the ground.

38:44.624 --> 38:45.923
You need a drink.

38:45.958 --> 38:48.559
I don't keep it around.

38:48.594 --> 38:51.695
Squirrels hide nuts for the winter.

38:51.731 --> 38:55.866
I got this for whenever.

39:17.857 --> 39:19.723
I don't belong here.

39:19.759 --> 39:21.759
I don't deserve to be here.

39:21.794 --> 39:25.763
Not in this office,
not in this building.

39:25.798 --> 39:26.997
By rights, I should be in jail.

39:27.033 --> 39:29.967
No argument from me.

39:30.002 --> 39:31.635
But say you were in jail,

39:31.671 --> 39:33.671
sucking on your own misery.

39:33.706 --> 39:34.972
Where would the thousands of people

39:35.007 --> 39:36.974
you saved tonight be, huh?

39:37.009 --> 39:38.575
Where would I be?

39:38.611 --> 39:42.980
What you did tonight was heroic.

39:43.015 --> 39:44.882
You could have done what I did.

39:44.917 --> 39:46.884
Anyone could have.

39:46.919 --> 39:49.620
You know what I was thinking
when I jumped in that car

39:49.655 --> 39:51.789
and I was flicking
through those channels?

39:51.824 --> 39:55.025
I was thinking,
"I can do this crazy thing.

39:55.061 --> 39:58.762
'Cause if it goes sideways,
Jim Gordon will save me."

40:00.066 --> 40:01.732
And here we are.

40:01.767 --> 40:05.736
Who I am...

40:05.771 --> 40:09.873
what I've always said I believe in,

40:09.909 --> 40:11.842
it's like it's a lie now, Harvey.

40:11.877 --> 40:16.547
Feet of clay are heavy to carry around.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.949
That's what the whiskey's for.

40:24.757 --> 40:26.757
I judged you.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.926
For a long time.

40:28.961 --> 40:31.895
I shouldn't have done that.

40:35.668 --> 40:37.868
What you know about me, Jim,

40:37.903 --> 40:39.870
is just the tip of the iceberg.

40:41.707 --> 40:45.709
There are no heroes here.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.781
No heroes here.

40:54.653 --> 40:56.720
Yeah?

40:56.756 --> 40:58.889
Got the Wayne kid on line three.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.023
Something about Valeska.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.730
Bruce, you okay?

41:06.766 --> 41:07.798
I saw Jerome Valeska tonight.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.800
- He killed his uncle.
- What?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.769
<i>He was looking for the name
of a school... St. Ignatius.</i>

41:11.804 --> 41:12.903
Why?

41:12.938 --> 41:14.505
I'm on my way to find out.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.739
<i>No. Wherever you are, stay put.</i>

41:15.775 --> 41:17.741
Valeska is my problem
as much as anyone's.

41:17.777 --> 41:18.976
- I'm going after him.
- Damn it, Bruce,

41:19.011 --> 41:21.678
stay the hell away from that madman.

41:21.714 --> 41:22.913
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.548
You can yell at me there.

41:24.583 --> 41:25.616
<i>Bruce?</i>

41:26.719 --> 41:27.951
Kid in trouble again?

41:27.987 --> 41:29.553
More than he can handle.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.522
Let's go.

42:02.621 --> 42:04.755
How do you like the new threads? Hmm?

42:04.790 --> 42:07.925
Oh, speechless, I know.

42:09.595 --> 42:11.995
You look a fright, Mr. Tetch.

42:12.031 --> 42:13.897
Somewhat lame, my dear Mr. Crane.

42:13.933 --> 42:16.800
But I do confess pure joy

42:16.836 --> 42:19.703
in besting Jimmy boy with our ploy.

42:19.738 --> 42:22.506
Yeah, yeah, you did a great job
keeping Gordon occupied.

42:22.541 --> 42:23.774
Meanwhile, Crane got his fear gas,

42:23.809 --> 42:25.809
I got my information;
everything is going

42:25.845 --> 42:27.778
according to my plan.

42:27.813 --> 42:30.914
But, no time to palaver, gentlemen.

42:30.950 --> 42:32.850
We have fish to fry.

42:32.885 --> 42:36.787
And by fish, I mean faces, or... feet.

42:38.624 --> 42:40.958
Ah, something fun to fry.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.659
Buckle up.

42:47.633 --> 42:50.534
All aboard!

42:50.569 --> 42:52.736
Oh, I'm coming.
