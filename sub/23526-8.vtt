<b>- PREVIOUSLY ON "ALL STARS"...</b>

00:01.902 --> 00:04.638
<b>- You'll be starring in</b>
<b>the raunchiest comedy</b>

00:04.671 --> 00:06.773
<b>of all time.</b>

00:06.807 --> 00:07.975
<b>- Yeah, that's all</b>
<b>you got, lady:</b>

00:08.008 --> 00:09.643
<b>big feet and</b>
<b>ugly [bleep] pumps.</b>

00:09.676 --> 00:10.944
<b>[laughs]</b>

00:10.978 --> 00:12.946
<b>- This is some "How to Get Away</b>
<b>With MURDER" [bleep].</b>

00:12.980 --> 00:14.081
<b>[laughs]</b>

00:14.114 --> 00:16.283
<b>- Bebe Zahara Benet...</b>

00:16.316 --> 00:19.486
<b>- I would have loved bigger</b>
<b>and more ridiculous.</b>

00:19.520 --> 00:21.255
<b>- Kennedy Davenport.</b>

00:21.288 --> 00:23.857
<b>- I was kind of hoping you'd do</b>
<b>more of the Emma Stone nuances.</b>

00:23.891 --> 00:25.125
<b>- Morgan McMichaels.</b>

00:25.158 --> 00:27.394
<b>- I worked with you the most</b>
<b>and I wanted even more.</b>

00:29.263 --> 00:31.798
<b>- Shangela, you are a winner.</b>
<b>- Yay!</b>

00:31.832 --> 00:34.334
<b>Yay!</b>

00:34.368 --> 00:37.804
<b>- Which queen have you</b>
<b>chosen to get the chop?</b>

00:37.838 --> 00:41.708
<b>- The person I'm sending home</b>
<b>is my sister and friend,</b>

00:44.444 --> 00:45.579
<b>Morgan.</b>

00:46.813 --> 00:49.650
<b>- Morgan, sashay away.</b>

00:57.791 --> 00:59.860
<b>[laughing]</b>

01:01.728 --> 01:03.530
<b>- All right.</b>

01:03.564 --> 01:05.699
<b>- We made it.</b>
<b>- Lord.</b>

01:05.732 --> 01:07.734
<b>- Oh, Go.</b>
<b>- Oh.</b>

01:07.768 --> 01:10.237
<b>Morgan says, "I love you</b>
<b>all totally.</b>

01:10.270 --> 01:11.238
<b>Sister Forever."</b>

01:11.271 --> 01:12.539
<b>- Aw...</b>

01:12.573 --> 01:15.776
<b>Morgan, welcome to the</b>
<b>Return to "Drag Race" club.</b>

01:15.809 --> 01:16.910
<b>We love you.</b>

01:16.944 --> 01:18.845
<b>- It was a hard decision,</b>
<b>but honestly,</b>

01:18.879 --> 01:20.981
<b>these are the four</b>
<b>that deserve to be here.</b>

01:21.014 --> 01:22.316
<b>These are the four</b>
<b>that have fought</b>

01:22.349 --> 01:23.650
<b>for this competition.</b>

01:23.684 --> 01:25.052
<b>Two-time sister.</b>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.520
<b>- Yes, girl, there's a place</b>
<b>for you at our table.</b>

01:26.553 --> 01:28.088
<b>- Yes, indeed.</b>
<b>We love you, Morgan.</b>

01:28.121 --> 01:29.723
<b>- We love you, Morgan!</b>

01:29.756 --> 01:32.292
<b>Morgan.</b>

01:32.326 --> 01:33.994
<b>- So, we are very curious.</b>

01:34.027 --> 01:39.032
<b>If you had won the lip sync,</b>
<b>who would you have chosen?</b>

01:39.066 --> 01:41.635
<b>- Out of respect for Morgan...</b>

01:41.668 --> 01:45.105
<b>[laughing]</b>

01:45.138 --> 01:47.307
<b>- I was actually not</b>
<b>a difficult decision for me.</b>

01:47.341 --> 01:48.675
<b>It was also Morgan.</b>

01:48.709 --> 01:49.943
<b>I could not with</b>
<b>good conscience</b>

01:49.977 --> 01:52.012
<b>after all you guys</b>
<b>have done here--</b>

01:52.045 --> 01:53.113
<b>- Yeah.</b>

01:53.113 --> 01:54.147
<b>- It would've just</b>
<b>been not right.</b>

01:54.181 --> 01:57.117
<b>- And she recognized it, too.</b>

01:57.117 --> 02:00.354
<b>- Bitch, we are making</b>
<b>it to the finals.</b>

02:00.387 --> 02:01.755
<b>- Yay! Top four.</b>

02:01.788 --> 02:04.291
<b>I'm so happy.</b>
<b>I'm so proud of myself.</b>

02:04.324 --> 02:06.793
<b>I feel like Celie</b>
<b>in "The Color Purple".</b>

02:06.827 --> 02:09.963
<b>I'm here.</b>
<b>Dear God, I'm here.</b>

02:09.997 --> 02:11.865
<b>We're almost there</b>
<b>to the top, though,</b>

02:11.899 --> 02:15.135
<b>so my question is, who's</b>
<b>about to show girls the ho</b>

02:15.135 --> 02:16.303
<b>and throw the beads</b>
<b>on the ground?</b>

02:16.336 --> 02:17.804
<b>- Well, bitch,</b>
<b>I'd be the first one.</b>

02:18.805 --> 02:20.207
<b>[laughs]</b>

02:20.240 --> 02:22.643
<b>- I will, because I need</b>
<b>the crown a second time.</b>

02:22.676 --> 02:24.411
<b>- Oh, oh.</b>
<b>- Girl.</b>

02:24.444 --> 02:26.380
<b>- I'm looking around the room,</b>
<b>there's four of us.</b>

02:26.413 --> 02:28.815
<b>- And the last time they</b>
<b>went down to a top three.</b>

02:28.849 --> 02:30.684
<b>So I'm trying to</b>
<b>kind of detect</b>

02:30.717 --> 02:32.386
<b>who would be the next to go.</b>

02:32.419 --> 02:34.988
<b>I don't think it's me,</b>
<b>and at this point,</b>

02:35.022 --> 02:36.423
<b>Shangela's the front runner,</b>

02:36.456 --> 02:38.292
<b>so I think it's going to be</b>
<b>BeBe or Kennedy.</b>

02:38.325 --> 02:39.393
<b>[giggles]</b>

02:39.426 --> 02:43.664
<b>- The competition has</b>
<b>become fierce.</b>

02:43.697 --> 02:46.066
<b>Everybody's here</b>
<b>to win, honey.</b>

02:46.166 --> 02:48.302
<b>Oh, come on, people,</b>
<b>don't you really think</b>

02:48.335 --> 02:51.271
<b>my face would look gorgeous</b>
<b>in the hall of fame?</b>

02:55.342 --> 02:57.644
<b>I know you can't see it with</b>
<b>the makeup but just really</b>

02:57.678 --> 02:58.779
<b>picture the beauty.</b>

03:04.885 --> 03:07.120

03:45.926 --> 03:48.462
<b>I had no idea that</b>
<b>each of you</b>

<b>First, starting</b>
<b>with my song "Kitty Girl",</b>

04:11.451 --> 04:14.821
<b>you need to compose</b>
<b>and perform a solo</b>

04:14.855 --> 04:19.192

04:19.226 --> 04:20.360
<b>- Okay.</b>

04:20.394 --> 04:22.596
<b>- And later</b>
<b>with Todrick Hall,</b>

<b>you need to come up</b>
<b>with choreography</b>

<b>- The eliminated queens</b>

05:15.149 --> 05:16.917

05:16.951 --> 05:19.153
<b>- Ugh, they're not gone yet?</b>

05:19.186 --> 05:21.088
<b>- Why are they at the house?</b>

05:21.121 --> 05:22.723
<b>They done come back</b>
<b>more than me!</b>

05:22.756 --> 05:26.060
<b>Who keeps letting them back in?</b>
<b>Baby, lock the doors.</b>

05:26.093 --> 05:27.862
<b>- Not only are</b>
<b>they returning,</b>

05:27.895 --> 05:30.264
<b>but they will play</b>
<b>a vital role</b>

05:30.297 --> 05:32.733
<b>in your final evaluation.</b>

05:32.766 --> 05:34.201
<b>- Oh, wow.</b>

05:34.235 --> 05:36.203
<b>- And tomorrow,</b>
<b>on the main stage,</b>

05:36.237 --> 05:39.173
<b>more will be revealed.</b>

05:39.206 --> 05:40.875
<b>So, good luck.</b>

05:40.908 --> 05:43.611
<b>- And don't [bleep] it up.</b>

05:46.347 --> 05:47.781
<b>[grumbling]</b>

05:47.815 --> 05:50.084
<b>- I'm sick of this.</b>

05:50.117 --> 05:51.619
<b>They're playing games.</b>

05:51.652 --> 05:53.654
<b>- Someone pulled a muscle</b>
<b>pulling this padge.</b>

05:53.687 --> 05:56.257
<b>My friend named Padge,</b>
<b>she got pulled.</b>

05:56.290 --> 05:57.925
<b>Maybe these people are going</b>
<b>to provide</b>

05:57.958 --> 05:59.393
<b>some sort of</b>
<b>vote or insight</b>

05:59.426 --> 06:01.695
<b>on who was an All Star</b>
<b>back here?</b>

06:01.729 --> 06:04.498
<b>- Do you think we have to</b>
<b>plead our case to them?</b>

06:04.532 --> 06:06.333
<b>And they get to vote</b>
<b>like a jury?</b>

06:06.367 --> 06:08.035
<b>- I don't think so.</b>

06:08.068 --> 06:10.037
<b>I think that they probably</b>
<b>will be dancers.</b>

06:10.037 --> 06:12.506
<b>[laughs]</b>

06:13.908 --> 06:16.076
<b>- Of course she thinks they're</b>

06:16.110 --> 06:18.546
<b>BeBe thinks we're all</b>
<b>backup dancers.</b>

06:20.848 --> 06:23.751
<b>- Hello, ladies.</b>
<b>- Hi, Toddie.</b>

<b>- It's time to learn</b>
<b>our choreography</b>

06:26.086 --> 06:29.323
<b>for "Kitty Girl"</b>
<b>with Todrick Hall, honey.</b>

06:29.356 --> 06:30.558
<b>- Oh, bitch,</b>
<b>I'm excited.</b>

06:30.591 --> 06:32.660
<b>I get to be Beyonce's bitch,</b>

06:32.693 --> 06:34.061
<b>and we're gonna have dancers?</b>

06:34.094 --> 06:36.897
<b>Okay, ladies, now let's</b>
<b>get in formation.</b>

06:36.931 --> 06:38.232
<b>Ha!</b>

06:38.265 --> 06:41.268
<b>- This is a challenge</b>
<b>that separates the women</b>

06:41.302 --> 06:42.503
<b>from the divas.</b>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.238
<b>I brought some beautiful,</b>
<b>sexy men here</b>

06:44.271 --> 06:46.240
<b>today to dance with us.</b>
<b>- Hi, boys.</b>

06:46.273 --> 06:48.175
<b>- I'm going to get through</b>
<b>this as long as</b>

06:48.209 --> 06:50.478
<b>they do not assign me</b>
<b>that guy right there.</b>

06:50.511 --> 06:52.880
<b>- Can I have the boys come up</b>
<b>on stage really quickly?</b>

06:52.913 --> 06:55.716
<b>- Because he's so hot, I'm</b>
<b>having a [bleep] heart attack.</b>

06:55.749 --> 06:57.952
<b>- Enrique, can you dance</b>
<b>with Bebe?</b>

06:57.985 --> 06:59.220
<b>Jake, you're gonna dance</b>
<b>with Shangela.</b>

06:59.253 --> 07:00.521
<b>- Hello.</b>

07:00.554 --> 07:01.856
<b>- Braydon, you're with Trixie.</b>
<b>- Hi, Braydon.</b>

07:01.889 --> 07:03.657
<b>I'm a really nice person</b>
<b>who has a lot to offer.</b>

07:03.691 --> 07:05.926
<b>[laughing]</b>

07:07.928 --> 07:11.198
<b>- You're gonna go</b>
<b>one and two.</b>

07:11.232 --> 07:13.234
<b>You're gonna spin out</b>
<b>to the right.</b>

07:13.267 --> 07:14.535
<b>To the right.</b>

07:14.568 --> 07:15.803
<b>Other right.</b>
<b>- Yes, sir.</b>

07:15.836 --> 07:17.138
<b>- You're gonna jump up</b>
<b>on the count of three.</b>

07:17.171 --> 07:18.572
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- One, two, three.</b>

07:19.573 --> 07:20.708
<b>- Bitch.</b>

07:20.741 --> 07:21.742
<b>- There you go.</b>
<b>- Okay.</b>

07:21.775 --> 07:23.110
<b>- Cool?</b>

07:23.144 --> 07:24.311
<b>What is that look for?</b>

07:24.345 --> 07:25.813
<b>- Because I hate heights,</b>
<b>but I will do it.</b>

07:25.846 --> 07:27.314
<b>[laughs]</b>

07:27.348 --> 07:29.683
<b>- You're not high, you're</b>
<b>jumping less high than you are.</b>

07:29.717 --> 07:30.718
<b>Your head's down there.</b>

07:34.421 --> 07:36.223
<b>- It's so funny.</b>

07:36.257 --> 07:38.526
<b>- Five, six, seven and eight.</b>

07:38.559 --> 07:40.828
<b>And out, and in.</b>

07:40.861 --> 07:42.229
<b>BeBe, where are you at?</b>
<b>- Sorry.</b>

07:42.263 --> 07:43.731
<b>- Six, seven, eight.</b>
<b>- Sorry.</b>

07:43.764 --> 07:45.166
<b>- You okay?</b>

07:45.199 --> 07:46.400
<b>- Yeah, I was just</b>
<b>trying to block it.</b>

07:46.433 --> 07:48.402
<b>- Okay, let's do it again</b>
<b>for BeBe.</b>

07:48.435 --> 07:52.439
<b>- Girl, BeBe is very in touch</b>
<b>with this part of her body,</b>

07:52.473 --> 07:54.275
<b>not so much the rest of it.</b>

07:54.308 --> 07:57.311
<b>- And one, and two.</b>
<b>Three, and four.</b>

07:57.344 --> 07:59.446
<b>- Five, six,</b>
<b>seven and eight.</b>

07:59.480 --> 08:01.182
<b>And one and two.</b>

08:01.215 --> 08:04.018
<b>Four, five, six,</b>
<b>seven, eight.</b>

08:04.051 --> 08:05.319
<b>- Oh, sorry.</b>

08:05.352 --> 08:06.487
<b>Lift me up.</b>

08:06.520 --> 08:07.822
<b>- Wait, wait, wait,</b>
<b>wait, wait, wait.</b>

08:07.855 --> 08:10.191
<b>Down, and jump, and</b>
<b>lift up our legs.</b>

08:11.926 --> 08:14.195
<b>- BeBe.</b>
<b>Bitch.</b>

08:14.228 --> 08:17.531
<b>Wait, wait, wait.</b>
<b>Then, go.</b>

08:17.565 --> 08:19.633
<b>- She is a struggle bus today.</b>

08:20.768 --> 08:22.169
<b>- You're the last one</b>
<b>and right now</b>

08:22.203 --> 08:24.038
<b>your lift is</b>
<b>the weakest looking.</b>

08:24.038 --> 08:25.339
<b>So just throw your</b>
<b>[bleep] legs up there.</b>

08:25.372 --> 08:27.041
<b>Otherwise, it's gonna look</b>

08:27.041 --> 08:29.043
<b>powerful, powerful,</b>
<b>powerful, weak.</b>

08:29.076 --> 08:32.179
<b>And that's not how</b>
<b>we want to go out.</b>

08:32.213 --> 08:34.315
<b>And one, and two,</b>
<b>three, and four.</b>

08:34.348 --> 08:36.450
<b>Five, six, seven, eight.</b>

08:36.484 --> 08:38.152
<b>Wrong arms, Kennedy.</b>

08:38.185 --> 08:40.888
<b>Four and five,</b>
<b>six, seven, eight.</b>

08:44.458 --> 08:46.193
<b>This is the</b>
<b>final performance.</b>

08:46.227 --> 08:47.895
<b>And last year, they</b>
<b>killed this performance.</b>

08:47.928 --> 08:50.464
<b>Right now, it doesn't</b>
<b>look like four stars</b>

08:50.498 --> 08:52.333
<b>running down a runway</b>
<b>looking fierce.</b>

08:52.366 --> 08:54.768
<b>It looks like</b>
<b>three hesitant people</b>

08:54.802 --> 08:56.303
<b>and then one person</b>
<b>that's just lost,</b>

08:56.337 --> 08:57.938
<b>because the moves are</b>
<b>not sharp, okay?</b>

08:57.972 --> 09:00.774
<b>And this is only the beginning</b>
<b>of what you guys are doing.</b>

09:03.511 --> 09:04.712
<b>Follow me.</b>

09:04.745 --> 09:06.247
<b>- I'd rather not.</b>

09:06.280 --> 09:08.883
<b>I'd rather sit her</b>
<b>and touch Braydon.</b>

09:08.916 --> 09:10.184
<b>- Where are we going?</b>

09:10.217 --> 09:12.052
<b>- You'll see.</b>

09:12.086 --> 09:13.154
<b>- Lord.</b>

09:14.255 --> 09:15.523
<b>What is this?</b>

09:17.191 --> 09:22.196
<b>So, for the first time</b>
<b>in "Drag Race" herstory,</b>

09:22.229 --> 09:24.698
<b>the majority of this dance</b>
<b>is going to take place</b>

09:24.732 --> 09:25.766
<b>behind the scenes.</b>

09:28.169 --> 09:30.738
<b>We're going to be shooting</b>
<b>the entire performance live.</b>

09:30.771 --> 09:32.106
<b>It is only one take.</b>

09:32.139 --> 09:34.675
<b>You only get one chance</b>
<b>to do this performance.</b>

09:34.708 --> 09:37.778
<b>No stops, only one camera</b>
<b>is going to be following you.</b>

09:37.812 --> 09:40.748
<b>You're going to have to be</b>
<b>dodging dancers, using props.</b>

09:40.781 --> 09:42.583
<b>There's going to be tons</b>
<b>of choreography.</b>

09:42.616 --> 09:44.485
<b>- Of course I'm a little afraid,</b>
<b>but more than anything,</b>

09:44.518 --> 09:47.188
<b>I'm like, this is going</b>
<b>to be amazing.</b>

09:47.221 --> 09:49.056
<b>"Read U Wrote U"</b>
<b>is so canceled.</b>

09:49.056 --> 09:50.658
<b>[laughs]</b>

09:50.691 --> 09:52.760
<b>- That is so fierce.</b>

09:52.793 --> 09:56.063
<b>- Well, we'll see if you</b>
<b>think it's fierce come tomorrow.</b>

09:56.096 --> 09:58.065
<b>This is going to be</b>
<b>really cool if you nail it,</b>

09:58.065 --> 10:01.101
<b>and a really really</b>
<b>huge epic fail if you don't.</b>

10:01.135 --> 10:03.771
<b>- Please, don't [bleep] it up.</b>

10:06.407 --> 10:07.608
<b>- [RuPaul] Coming up...</b>

10:07.641 --> 10:10.211
<b>- I've asked the</b>
<b>eliminated queens</b>

10:10.244 --> 10:13.047
<b>to help me make</b>
<b>my final decision.</b>

10:16.684 --> 10:18.219
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

10:23.689 --> 10:26.759
<b>- Oh!</b>

10:26.793 --> 10:30.763
<b>Today we are going to be doing</b>
<b>a live musical performance</b>

10:30.797 --> 10:34.567
<b>to Ru's "Kitty Girl"</b>
<b>in one continuous take.</b>

10:34.600 --> 10:37.804
<b>Baby, they have</b>
<b>raised the bar.</b>

10:37.837 --> 10:40.940
<b>- Let's do this.</b>

10:40.973 --> 10:43.309
<b>- Today, we're going to find out</b>
<b>who makes it into</b>

10:43.342 --> 10:44.710
<b>the All Stars Hall of Fame.</b>

10:44.744 --> 10:46.412
<b>- How's everybody feeling?</b>

10:46.446 --> 10:48.247
<b>- Good girl.</b>
<b>- Word, girl.</b>

10:48.281 --> 10:50.516
<b>You all are finalists.</b>

10:50.550 --> 10:51.851
<b>- ♪ Yeah </b>

10:51.884 --> 10:53.486
<b>I'm already singing</b>
<b>"A Moment Like This"</b>

10:53.519 --> 10:55.354
<b>by Kelly Clarkson</b>
<b>in my head.</b>

10:55.388 --> 10:57.223
<b>Miss Thing from Season Two?</b>

10:57.256 --> 10:59.025
<b>Could be crowned</b>
<b>by RuPaul today.</b>

11:03.062 --> 11:04.797
<b>You guys, the eliminated</b>
<b>and the self-eliminator</b>

11:04.831 --> 11:06.165
<b>are going to be here.</b>

11:06.199 --> 11:07.433
<b>I don't know what</b>
<b>they're going to be doing,</b>

11:07.467 --> 11:08.968
<b>but I think what</b>
<b>it's going to do is</b>

11:09.001 --> 11:10.937
<b>that it's going to</b>
<b>re-awaken emotions</b>

11:10.970 --> 11:13.706
<b>because it's almost like</b>
<b>"I should be the one</b>

11:13.739 --> 11:16.509
<b>being in top four."</b>

11:16.542 --> 11:18.211
<b>- I'm at peace with the fact</b>
<b>that they're probably</b>

11:18.244 --> 11:21.647
<b>not going to be 100% happy</b>
<b>for us in this moment.</b>

11:21.681 --> 11:24.350
<b>- It could be possible</b>
<b>for the eliminated queens</b>

11:24.383 --> 11:27.420
<b>to, you know, feel some</b>
<b>type of animosity</b>

11:27.453 --> 11:29.255
<b>whatever the case</b>
<b>may be, but</b>

11:29.288 --> 11:31.023
<b>it's just stupid</b>
<b>to feel that way.</b>

11:31.057 --> 11:32.258
<b>That's BS.</b>

11:32.291 --> 11:34.093
<b>- When you look at</b>
<b>the whole room</b>

11:34.127 --> 11:35.995
<b>when everybody walked in,</b>

11:36.028 --> 11:38.131
<b>did you figure out</b>
<b>you'd make the four?</b>

11:38.164 --> 11:40.867
<b>- There was moments</b>
<b>where I was unsure.</b>

11:40.900 --> 11:42.301
<b>So, in the Snatch Game,</b>
<b>I thought</b>

11:42.335 --> 11:43.636
<b>I might not be here right now.</b>

11:43.669 --> 11:46.139
<b>- Trixie, she started</b>
<b>off rough,</b>

11:46.172 --> 11:48.541
<b>came back, she was just</b>
<b>in the top two with me.</b>

11:48.574 --> 11:50.777
<b>So, she's on a momentum, girl.</b>

11:50.810 --> 11:53.913
<b>And I can see her in the top</b>
<b>and she can see me there, too.</b>

11:54.013 --> 11:55.515
<b>- I didn't win</b>
<b>challenges early on,</b>

11:55.548 --> 11:58.217
<b>but like Kennedy hasn't won</b>
<b>a challenge since episode 3,</b>

11:58.251 --> 11:59.819
<b>so...</b>

11:59.852 --> 12:01.554
<b>- You know, in competitions</b>
<b>like this,</b>

12:01.587 --> 12:04.424
<b>I feel like it was more</b>
<b>than just was I produced</b>

12:04.457 --> 12:07.160
<b>you know, in front</b>
<b>of the cameras.</b>

12:07.193 --> 12:10.129
<b>To me, it is also</b>
<b>what I invested</b>

12:10.163 --> 12:11.898
<b>in my friendships,</b>

12:11.931 --> 12:14.100
<b>because at the</b>
<b>end of the day,</b>

12:14.133 --> 12:15.668
<b>my fate is</b>
<b>in y'all hands.</b>

12:15.701 --> 12:18.137
<b>I wasn't at the top</b>
<b>all the time,</b>

12:18.171 --> 12:19.839
<b>but at the end of</b>
<b>all of this,</b>

12:19.872 --> 12:22.175
<b>I really want to win,</b>

12:22.208 --> 12:25.144
<b>to be, you know,</b>
<b>one of the three standing.</b>

12:25.178 --> 12:26.813
<b>- You know, this whole season</b>
<b>has had</b>

12:26.846 --> 12:28.414
<b>a lot of twists and turns,</b>

12:28.448 --> 12:31.284
<b>and you just never,</b>
<b>ever know.</b>

12:31.317 --> 12:33.619
<b>- They could come back</b>
<b>and pull the padge, girl.</b>

12:33.653 --> 12:37.156
<b>- Of course there's going</b>
<b>to be sides taken,</b>

12:37.190 --> 12:38.324
<b>but I'm not afraid.</b>

12:38.357 --> 12:40.993
<b>Because if you look at</b>
<b>just my report card,</b>

12:41.027 --> 12:42.595
<b>I deserve the title.</b>

12:42.628 --> 12:46.466
<b>I have shown growth,</b>
<b>I've been consistent.</b>

12:46.499 --> 12:49.001
<b>The decision is</b>
<b>out of our hands now.</b>

12:49.001 --> 12:51.003
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- We can just enjoy the moment</b>

12:51.003 --> 12:53.306
<b>Go do the best that we can do,</b>

12:53.339 --> 12:55.808

<b>That's what this show</b>
<b>is all about,</b>

18:12.546 --> 18:14.781
<b>is pride, is freedom,</b>

18:14.814 --> 18:17.150
<b>and it just comes</b>
<b>full circle for me.</b>

18:17.183 --> 18:19.386
<b>- Taste the rainbow.</b>
<b>- Yes!</b>

18:19.419 --> 18:22.289
<b>- The reading rainbow!</b>

18:22.322 --> 18:24.758
<b>- [RuPaul] Up next, Shangela.</b>

18:24.791 --> 18:26.927
<b>- Ooh.</b>

18:26.960 --> 18:29.596
<b>- [RuPaul] She's serving</b>
<b>hot pockets.</b>

18:29.629 --> 18:31.097
<b>- [Shangela] I'm floating.</b>

18:31.131 --> 18:32.699
<b>Baby, you can't even</b>
<b>see my feet.</b>

18:32.732 --> 18:34.834
<b>I feel like Cinderella</b>
<b>at the ball.</b>

18:34.868 --> 18:38.171
<b>And I'm gonna be here</b>
<b>well past midnight.</b>

18:38.205 --> 18:42.008
<b>- [Michelle] Marilyn</b>
<b>Mon-whoa!</b>

18:42.042 --> 18:44.544
<b>- [RuPaul] Up next,</b>
<b>Trixie Mattel.</b>

18:46.780 --> 18:48.281
<b>- Femme fatale.</b>

18:48.315 --> 18:50.450
<b>- This reminds me, I have</b>
<b>to take my dog to the groomer.</b>

18:50.450 --> 18:51.585
<b>[laughing]</b>

18:51.618 --> 18:54.020
<b>- [Trixie] This is like</b>
<b>25th Anniversary</b>

18:54.054 --> 18:55.021
<b>Christmas edition Trixie.</b>

18:55.055 --> 18:56.957
<b>Still in box,</b>
<b>mint condition.</b>

18:56.990 --> 19:00.694
<b>The silhouette and the textures</b>
<b>are undeniably classic.</b>

19:00.727 --> 19:02.929
<b>- [RuPaul]</b>
<b>Oh, Slay West.</b>

19:02.963 --> 19:05.632
<b>Why don't you come up</b>
<b>and groom me sometime?</b>

19:05.665 --> 19:07.467
<b>[laughing]</b>

19:08.835 --> 19:11.171
<b>Welcome, ladies.</b>

19:11.204 --> 19:14.875
<b>As you see, I've asked</b>
<b>the eliminated queens</b>

19:14.908 --> 19:17.744
<b>a jury of your queer peers</b>

19:17.777 --> 19:20.547
<b>to help me make</b>
<b>my final decision.</b>

19:23.016 --> 19:25.151
<b>After tonight's critiques,</b>

19:25.185 --> 19:29.089
<b>they'll meet each of you</b>
<b>in the work room.</b>

19:29.122 --> 19:32.425
<b>And then, they will</b>
<b>vote to decide...</b>

19:34.794 --> 19:38.064
<b>who will be the top two</b>
<b>All Stars of the season.</b>

19:42.269 --> 19:44.938
<b>- This done been had been</b>

19:44.971 --> 19:46.039
<b>RuPaul's best "Drag Race".</b>

19:46.072 --> 19:47.440
<b>There's gonna be</b>
<b>eliminated queens</b>

19:47.440 --> 19:48.875
<b>who choose who won</b>
<b>the most challenges,</b>

19:48.909 --> 19:51.311
<b>there's gonna be eliminated</b>
<b>queens who choose their friend.</b>

19:51.344 --> 19:53.647
<b>And there's gonna be eliminated</b>
<b>queens who do not choose</b>

19:53.680 --> 19:55.916
<b>certain people because</b>
<b>they don't like them.</b>

19:55.949 --> 19:59.486
<b>- The top two will go on</b>
<b>to lip sync for the chance</b>

19:59.519 --> 20:02.556
<b>to win $100,000</b>

20:02.589 --> 20:07.460
<b>and a coveted place in</b>
<b>the "Drag Race" hall of fame.</b>

20:08.995 --> 20:13.333
<b>So, let's get started with</b>
<b>the judges' final critiques.</b>

20:13.366 --> 20:18.171
<b>Starting with Bebe Zahara Benet.</b>
<b>- Meow.</b>

20:18.205 --> 20:20.106
<b>- [Michelle] Choreography may</b>
<b>not be your strong suit,</b>

20:20.140 --> 20:21.975
<b>but you did your thing,</b>
<b>you showed your body.</b>

20:22.008 --> 20:23.843
<b>I'm super proud of you.</b>
<b>- Thank you.</b>

20:23.877 --> 20:24.911
<b>- This look, I love it.</b>

20:24.945 --> 20:26.213
<b>You took high fashion,</b>
<b>and you mix it</b>

20:26.246 --> 20:27.714
<b>with a little pinch of camp</b>

20:27.747 --> 20:29.516
<b>and I think that's what you've</b>
<b>done all season long.</b>

20:29.549 --> 20:31.585
<b>- You had the biggest</b>
<b>risk coming here</b>

20:31.618 --> 20:33.820
<b>because what if you flop?</b>

20:33.853 --> 20:36.656
<b>People think was a mistake</b>
<b>made way back in Season One?</b>

20:36.690 --> 20:38.558
<b>Did Steve Harvey read</b>
<b>the wrong name?</b>

20:40.860 --> 20:42.629
<b>But no mistakes were made.</b>

20:42.662 --> 20:45.065
<b>I have been a fan</b>
<b>since Season One.</b>

20:45.098 --> 20:46.499
<b>I'm an ever bigger fan now.</b>

20:46.533 --> 20:48.668
<b>- Oh my gosh,</b>
<b>I'm getting emotional.</b>

20:48.702 --> 20:51.438
<b>- Thank you, BeBe.</b>

20:51.438 --> 20:54.040
<b>Up next, Kennedy Davenport.</b>

20:54.074 --> 20:57.677
<b>- You came in this time with</b>
<b>a different attitude, it seems.</b>

20:57.711 --> 20:58.979
<b>It's really a gift to</b>
<b>be able to do this.</b>

20:59.012 --> 21:00.113
<b>- Yes.</b>

21:00.146 --> 21:01.314
<b>- Because you can</b>
<b>go back and go</b>

21:01.348 --> 21:03.216
<b>I'm gonna right what</b>
<b>I felt I did wrong.</b>

21:03.250 --> 21:05.919
<b>And you've done that.</b>

21:05.952 --> 21:09.723
<b>Your best look tonight</b>
<b>is a lot.</b>

21:09.756 --> 21:12.359
<b>- Michelle, believe it or not</b>
<b>I'm going to disagree with you.</b>

21:12.459 --> 21:14.461
<b>I love this,</b>
<b>because it's a moment.</b>

21:14.461 --> 21:15.462
<b>Because, Michelle--</b>
<b>- I didn't say I didn't like it.</b>

21:15.495 --> 21:17.030
<b>I just said it was a lot.</b>

21:17.063 --> 21:19.266
<b>- Yeah, it's a little campy,</b>
<b>but it's beautifully done.</b>

21:19.299 --> 21:22.469
<b>And I think the live</b>
<b>performance, you killed it.</b>

21:22.502 --> 21:25.405
<b>You opened the show,</b>
<b>it was phenomenal.</b>

21:25.405 --> 21:28.074
<b>You're an amazing dance,</b>
<b>it's one of your strong suits,</b>

21:28.108 --> 21:29.676
<b>and you really played to that.</b>

21:29.709 --> 21:32.145
<b>- And you showed the whole</b>
<b>world what Miss Thing can do.</b>

21:32.178 --> 21:33.280
<b>- It's time!</b>

21:33.313 --> 21:35.081
<b>- La Guardia, Newark, Kennedy,</b>
<b>whatever.</b>

21:35.115 --> 21:37.250
<b>You are ready for takeoff.</b>

21:37.284 --> 21:39.419
<b>- Thank you very much.</b>

21:39.419 --> 21:41.621
<b>- Up next, Shangela.</b>

21:41.655 --> 21:45.659
<b>- I have so enjoyed watching</b>
<b>you this entire season.</b>

21:45.692 --> 21:47.727
<b>I loved your fashion</b>
<b>every week,</b>

21:47.761 --> 21:49.162
<b>'cause it's very entertaining.</b>

21:49.196 --> 21:50.197
<b>It's really polished.</b>

21:50.230 --> 21:51.431
<b>It's also a little bit campy.</b>

21:51.464 --> 21:52.866
<b>But it's super fun</b>
<b>and well done.</b>

21:52.899 --> 21:54.434
<b>- And this look is a 10.</b>

21:54.434 --> 21:56.036
<b>I'm January Jonesing for more.</b>

21:56.069 --> 21:57.537
<b>[laughing]</b>

21:57.571 --> 21:59.739
<b>- And in the live performance,</b>
<b>any other bitch</b>

21:59.773 --> 22:02.776
<b>at the top of the game in music</b>
<b>should look over their shoulder.</b>

22:02.809 --> 22:04.945
<b>It just was to tight</b>
<b>and so right.</b>

22:04.978 --> 22:07.147
<b>It just looked like</b>
<b>somebody in their element.</b>

22:07.180 --> 22:08.248
<b>- You are a scene stealer.</b>

22:08.281 --> 22:10.183
<b>I mean, every single week,</b>
<b>you brought it.</b>

22:10.217 --> 22:12.052
<b>- She did that!</b>

22:12.085 --> 22:14.321
<b>- I'm so [bleep] proud</b>
<b>of you I can [bleep].</b>

22:14.354 --> 22:15.555
<b>- Cleanup on aisle two.</b>

22:15.589 --> 22:17.757
<b>[laughing]</b>

22:17.791 --> 22:18.792
<b>- Thank you, Shangela.</b>

22:18.825 --> 22:20.160
<b>- Thank you all.</b>

22:20.193 --> 22:22.095
<b>- Up next, Trixie Mattel.</b>

22:22.128 --> 22:23.396
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>

22:23.430 --> 22:26.399
<b>- You struggled for the</b>
<b>first half of the competition.</b>

22:26.399 --> 22:27.801
<b>- Yeah.</b>
<b>- And what we got</b>

22:27.834 --> 22:30.403
<b>after that point was</b>
<b>a different Trixie Mattel.</b>

22:30.403 --> 22:34.708
<b>You gave us outside</b>
<b>of the box Trixie Mattel.</b>

22:34.741 --> 22:36.543
<b>And we've seen look after</b>
<b>look that's been</b>

22:36.576 --> 22:39.512
<b>non-traditional Trixie</b>
<b>like tonight</b>

22:39.546 --> 22:42.215
<b>and we're all gagging.</b>
<b>- Agreed.</b>

22:42.249 --> 22:44.851
<b>But it's still you, you're</b>
<b>not lost in any of this.</b>

22:44.885 --> 22:47.954
<b>- Your live performance for me</b>
<b>was super fun because</b>

22:47.988 --> 22:49.656
<b>it was different to what you do.</b>

22:49.689 --> 22:51.224
<b>You have a country music album.</b>

22:51.258 --> 22:52.726
<b>- Yeah, it was kind</b>
<b>of unexpected.</b>

22:52.759 --> 22:54.227
<b>It was a little bit</b>
<b>more like J-lo.</b>

22:54.261 --> 22:55.896
<b>- Mmm.</b>
<b>- You probably get that a lot.</b>

22:55.929 --> 22:57.430
<b>- Oh my God.</b>

22:57.430 --> 23:00.000
<b>- It was a great surprise</b>
<b>to see you really sell it.</b>

23:00.033 --> 23:02.869
<b>- This queen who had this</b>
<b>limitless potential</b>

23:02.903 --> 23:07.507
<b>has blossomed into a fully</b>
<b>developed performer.</b>

23:07.541 --> 23:08.708
<b>- Thank you.</b>

23:08.742 --> 23:11.912
<b>- Trixie, I'm so proud of you.</b>

23:11.945 --> 23:14.281
<b>I'm proud of Shangela.</b>

23:14.314 --> 23:18.251
<b>And Kennedy and Bebe</b>
<b>and all of the girls.</b>

23:18.285 --> 23:21.988
<b>It really is the</b>
<b>pinnacle of my career</b>

23:22.022 --> 23:24.958
<b>dong this show and being</b>
<b>a launch pad for all of you.</b>

23:24.991 --> 23:29.396
<b>And I couldn't be</b>
<b>more proud right now.</b>

23:29.396 --> 23:34.401
<b>This competition is</b>
<b>coming down to a photo finish.</b>

23:34.401 --> 23:37.170
<b>To be honest,</b>
<b>it's got me stressed out.</b>

23:37.204 --> 23:42.943
<b>So, while you face a jury</b>
<b>of your queer peers,</b>

23:42.976 --> 23:47.847
<b>the judges and I will be</b>
<b>meditating for world peace.</b>

23:49.449 --> 23:51.418
<b>You may leave the stage.</b>

23:58.858 --> 24:01.428
<b>- Hello.</b>
<b>- Mrowr!</b>

24:01.428 --> 24:02.662
<b>- Hello, Mother!</b>

24:02.696 --> 24:04.164
<b>- [Thorgy] Take your</b>
<b>throne, girl.</b>

24:04.197 --> 24:05.899
<b>See, this looks natural</b>
<b>to her doesn't it?</b>

24:07.801 --> 24:09.736
<b>- I'm about to plead my case.</b>

24:09.769 --> 24:13.240
<b>As I'm sitting there,</b>
<b>the air is just dark.</b>

24:13.273 --> 24:15.308
<b>Listen, I am African</b>
<b>and I have a sixth sense.</b>

24:15.342 --> 24:17.811
<b>And I can't just tell that</b>
<b>the first thing</b>

24:17.844 --> 24:20.981
<b>that is in their mind is,</b>
<b>she has won already.</b>

24:21.014 --> 24:23.884
<b>She has already had the title.</b>

24:23.917 --> 24:26.186
<b>- I want to know what you feel</b>
<b>like you could contribute</b>

24:26.219 --> 24:30.056
<b>to the Hall of Fame and</b>
<b>the future of drag that</b>

24:30.090 --> 24:33.126
<b>we don't already get from,</b>
<b>like, Chad Michaels and Alaska?</b>

24:33.159 --> 24:35.629
<b>- I am an immigrant</b>
<b>that has a dream.</b>

24:35.662 --> 24:37.731
<b>Especially with the</b>
<b>political situation right now,</b>

24:37.764 --> 24:40.567
<b>your hopes and dreams are</b>
<b>being snatched away from you</b>

24:40.600 --> 24:42.202
<b>every day.</b>

24:42.235 --> 24:45.171
<b>Me sitting here represents</b>
<b>because if you work hard,</b>

24:45.205 --> 24:47.407
<b>and you're going to</b>
<b>be rewarded.</b>

24:47.440 --> 24:49.709
<b>- Can I ask something saucy</b>
<b>just for [bleep] and giggles?</b>

24:49.743 --> 24:51.811
<b>We want to know</b>
<b>who you would've picked</b>

24:51.845 --> 24:54.981
<b>after we lost the challenge</b>
<b>if you had won the lip sync</b>

24:55.015 --> 24:56.950
<b>to come back, and who you</b>
<b>would have eliminated</b>

24:56.983 --> 24:57.984
<b>out of your sisters?</b>

24:58.018 --> 25:01.922
<b>- That was a very hard</b>
<b>elimination.</b>

25:01.955 --> 25:06.326
<b>I asked the girls, is it</b>
<b>okay if I don't reveal</b>

25:06.426 --> 25:09.596
<b>who was going to come back</b>
<b>and who was going to go,</b>

25:09.629 --> 25:12.232
<b>and everybody agreed</b>
<b>that I should not.</b>

25:12.265 --> 25:16.836
<b>- I'm not going to reveal</b>
<b>who I was going to send home.</b>

25:16.870 --> 25:18.605
<b>- We do this every week, girl.</b>

25:18.638 --> 25:19.839
<b>You don't want to say?</b>

25:19.873 --> 25:22.776
<b>Girl, what the [bleep]?</b>

25:22.809 --> 25:26.813
<b>- And so out of respect,</b>
<b>I would rather not do that.</b>

25:26.846 --> 25:28.215
<b>- So nobody knows</b>
<b>who you picked?</b>

25:28.248 --> 25:30.250
<b>- Nobody knows, nobody has to.</b>
<b>- I want to know.</b>

25:30.283 --> 25:32.652
<b>- If we have any power...</b>
<b>can you just tell us</b>

25:32.686 --> 25:33.653
<b>without</b>
<b>feelings getting hurt?</b>

25:33.687 --> 25:34.754
<b>I'm curious.</b>

25:34.788 --> 25:36.423
<b>- I just feel like</b>
<b>my word is my word.</b>

25:36.456 --> 25:38.625
<b>- I'm just curious.</b>
<b>- My word is my word.</b>

25:38.658 --> 25:40.894
<b>And even if that will</b>
<b>take out points</b>

25:40.927 --> 25:43.463
<b>or take out a reason for you</b>
<b>not to put me in the two,</b>

25:43.496 --> 25:44.698
<b>I'm very fine with that.</b>

25:47.500 --> 25:50.036
<b>What does all of that</b>
<b>have to do</b>

25:50.070 --> 25:54.040
<b>with me getting a chance</b>
<b>to win the title?</b>

25:54.074 --> 25:55.508
<b>All the questions</b>
<b>that are coming</b>

25:55.542 --> 25:57.711
<b>have nothing to do</b>
<b>with my track record</b>

25:57.744 --> 25:59.179
<b>in the whole process</b>
<b>being here.</b>

25:59.212 --> 26:01.414
<b>It's almost like their mind</b>
<b>is already made up.</b>

26:01.414 --> 26:03.216
<b>Well, sisters,</b>
<b>I love you all.</b>

26:03.250 --> 26:04.918
<b>You all are stars.</b>

26:04.951 --> 26:06.987
<b>The power is in</b>
<b>your hands, so...</b>

26:07.020 --> 26:07.988
<b>That's all I'm gonna say.</b>

26:08.021 --> 26:09.522
<b>- We love you.</b>
<b>- Love you guys.</b>

26:09.556 --> 26:10.724
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye, baby.</b>

26:12.425 --> 26:14.995
<b>- I felt like she sat down</b>
<b>and she had this spiel,</b>

26:15.028 --> 26:16.997
<b>and I'm like, "Oh my God,</b>
<b>can you just relax?"</b>

26:17.030 --> 26:19.199
<b>We're all eliminated, just</b>
<b>talk to us like human beings.</b>

26:19.232 --> 26:20.534
<b>- Its very pageanty.</b>

26:20.567 --> 26:23.036
<b>- We're your sisters, so</b>
<b>to give us that kind of</b>

26:23.069 --> 26:25.272
<b>like speech to me was</b>
<b>kind of like, oh, girl.</b>

26:27.874 --> 26:30.143
<b>- Hey!</b>
<b>- Hi, Kennedy.</b>

26:30.176 --> 26:33.847
<b>- I'm good, this is just like</b>
<b>interviewing for a pageant.</b>

26:33.880 --> 26:37.884
<b>This is the opportunity for</b>
<b>you to convince the judges</b>

26:37.918 --> 26:41.087
<b>as to why you would be</b>
<b>the best fit.</b>

26:42.188 --> 26:43.189
<b>- I have a question.</b>

26:43.223 --> 26:45.659
<b>You are a very</b>
<b>good representation</b>

26:45.692 --> 26:47.761
<b>of where drag comes from.</b>

26:47.794 --> 26:50.397
<b>I want to know like how you</b>
<b>can take that to the future</b>

26:50.397 --> 26:52.933
<b>and further educate,</b>

26:52.966 --> 26:54.401
<b>especially the younger</b>
<b>generation.</b>

26:54.401 --> 26:56.803
<b>- Well, I feel like</b>
<b>I'm doing it now.</b>

26:56.836 --> 26:59.306
<b>Having the opportunity to</b>
<b>visit other places</b>

26:59.406 --> 27:01.007
<b>and see all</b>
<b>this beautiful drag,</b>

27:01.041 --> 27:03.510
<b>it just opened my mind</b>
<b>even more to be like,</b>

27:03.543 --> 27:05.545
<b>you know what,</b>
<b>you good baby.</b>

27:05.579 --> 27:07.013
<b>[laughing]</b>

27:07.047 --> 27:08.815
<b>And by me winning,</b>

27:08.848 --> 27:12.419
<b>it would only put me</b>
<b>on that platform to share.</b>

27:12.419 --> 27:15.455
<b>- I just want to say I am so,</b>
<b>so proud of you.</b>

27:15.488 --> 27:18.225
<b>I love you with</b>
<b>all of my heart.</b>

27:18.258 --> 27:19.693
<b>- I love you, too, so much.</b>

27:19.726 --> 27:23.430
<b>I should be in the top two</b>
<b>because I look at it like this:</b>

27:23.463 --> 27:24.764
<b>BeBe already won,</b>

27:24.798 --> 27:27.467
<b>Trixie already has a lot</b>
<b>going on for her,</b>

27:27.500 --> 27:30.237
<b>and Shangela, she has really</b>
<b>made a name for herself.</b>

27:30.270 --> 27:32.906
<b>And her fan base is probably</b>
<b>bigger than mine.</b>

27:32.939 --> 27:36.843
<b>None of the top four need</b>
<b>this as much as I do.</b>

27:36.877 --> 27:38.712
<b>If you do vote for me,</b>

27:38.745 --> 27:42.515
<b>I won't let you down.</b>
<b>You know I won't.</b>

27:42.549 --> 27:43.783
<b>- Well, we love you.</b>

27:43.817 --> 27:44.951
<b>- I love you, too.</b>
<b>- Love you baby.</b>

27:44.985 --> 27:46.419
<b>- What a positive light.</b>
<b>You're incredible.</b>

27:46.453 --> 27:47.420
<b>- Bye.</b>
<b>- Bye.</b>

27:47.454 --> 27:48.989
<b>- Love you.</b>
<b>- Love you all.</b>

27:50.223 --> 27:52.225
<b>- Well, that speaks to me,</b>
<b>someone that represents,</b>

27:52.259 --> 27:53.894
<b>like, the old school</b>
<b>of drag.</b>

27:53.927 --> 27:54.961
<b>I like that.</b>

27:54.995 --> 27:56.863
<b>- I just like how</b>
<b>real she was.</b>

27:56.897 --> 27:59.833
<b>People who are just real</b>
<b>make me so comfortable.</b>

27:59.866 --> 28:01.635
<b>BeBe doesn't make</b>
<b>me comfortable.</b>

28:03.003 --> 28:03.970
<b>- [RuPaul] Coming up...</b>

28:04.004 --> 28:05.305
<b>- Oh, yeah, I'm ready.</b>

28:05.338 --> 28:07.841
<b>On Season Seven,</b>
<b>Kennedy's finale runway</b>

28:07.874 --> 28:09.242
<b>was, like, a rainbow dress.</b>

28:09.276 --> 28:12.012
<b>That was like light years nicer</b>
<b>than the one she wore today.</b>

28:12.045 --> 28:13.747
<b>- All right, well,</b>
<b>I guess it's time</b>

28:13.780 --> 28:15.515
<b>to make the decisions, ladies.</b>

28:17.918 --> 28:19.452
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

28:24.417 --> 28:25.585
<b>- Where's my jury?</b>

28:25.619 --> 28:27.554
<b>Hi, girls!</b>
<b>- Yay!</b>

28:27.587 --> 28:29.222
<b>- Walking into deliberation,</b>
<b>I feel like Ned Stark</b>

28:29.255 --> 28:31.891
<b>of Game of Thrones</b>

28:31.925 --> 28:34.260
<b>when he was walking up</b>
<b>to that guillotine bitch.</b>

28:34.294 --> 28:36.162
<b>Hi, y'all.</b>

28:36.196 --> 28:37.597
<b>- Hi.</b>
<b>- Hi, Boo.</b>

28:37.631 --> 28:38.999
<b>- Let's look at the six.</b>

28:39.032 --> 28:42.268
<b>Three of them, I ended</b>
<b>their "Drag Race" journey.</b>

28:42.302 --> 28:44.104
<b>Two of them are</b>
<b>looking at me like,</b>

28:44.137 --> 28:46.673
<b>"That should be me up there.</b>
<b>I was eliminated too early."</b>

28:46.706 --> 28:49.643
<b>And one of them, she sent</b>
<b>herself to the house</b>

28:49.676 --> 28:50.977
<b>only to have to come back</b>

28:51.011 --> 28:53.146
<b>so I know she's like,</b>
<b>"Bitch, that could be me."</b>

28:53.179 --> 28:55.348
<b>Honey, I got zero out of six.</b>

28:55.382 --> 28:59.686
<b>- How do you feel about</b>
<b>us choosing the top two?</b>

28:59.719 --> 29:01.955
<b>- Well, to be honest with you,</b>
<b>I was like, "oh, Lord."</b>

29:01.988 --> 29:05.425
<b>Because Kennedy, BeBe and I</b>

29:05.458 --> 29:07.661
<b>have all been put in the</b>
<b>difficult situation before</b>

29:07.694 --> 29:09.129
<b>of sending someone home.</b>

29:09.162 --> 29:10.530
<b>Trixie has not,</b>
<b>so we were all like,</b>

29:10.563 --> 29:11.998
<b>well, we already got</b>
<b>one leg down,</b>

29:12.032 --> 29:14.034
<b>if anyone was to</b>
<b>hold a grudge.</b>

29:14.067 --> 29:16.236
<b>Oh yeah, I'm wrecked,</b>
<b>but I'm feeling,</b>

29:16.269 --> 29:18.538
<b>"Okay, don't give up Shange."</b>

29:18.571 --> 29:22.008
<b>Just be genuine and be honest</b>
<b>and just pour your heart out.</b>

29:22.042 --> 29:24.177
<b>- Season Two.</b>
<b>- Yes, ma'am.</b>

29:24.177 --> 29:25.211
<b>- Season Three.</b>

29:25.245 --> 29:26.646
<b>"All Stars 3."</b>

29:26.680 --> 29:29.683
<b>What makes this feel that this</b>
<b>is your time to get this crown?</b>

29:29.716 --> 29:32.052
<b>- Honestly, after Season</b>
<b>Two and Three,</b>

29:32.085 --> 29:34.020
<b>I went to drag school.</b>

29:34.054 --> 29:36.589
<b>True story, I was working,</b>
<b>but the whole time,</b>

29:36.623 --> 29:38.825
<b>I was watching people,</b>
<b>I was asking questions.</b>

29:38.858 --> 29:40.593
<b>And I just never gave up,</b>

29:40.627 --> 29:43.830
<b>and I feel like tonight</b>
<b>is my graduation. Truly.</b>

29:43.863 --> 29:45.632
<b>Even though if you all</b>
<b>don't choose me</b>

29:45.665 --> 29:47.667
<b>to be the valedictorian,</b>
<b>I still get my diploma</b>

29:47.701 --> 29:50.070
<b>in drag, and not because</b>
<b>nobody gave it to me.</b>

29:50.103 --> 29:51.938
<b>It's because I earned it.</b>
<b>- You did.</b>

29:51.972 --> 29:54.207
<b>- I've been work--</b>

29:55.842 --> 29:59.279
<b>I've been working not just to</b>
<b>prove something to other people,</b>

29:59.312 --> 30:01.348
<b>but also to prove it to myself.</b>

30:01.381 --> 30:04.684
<b>A spot in the All Stars</b>
<b>Hall of Fame validates</b>

30:04.718 --> 30:07.220
<b>all the work that</b>
<b>you've done, to me, I feel.</b>

30:07.220 --> 30:09.456
<b>I want people to say,</b>
<b>look at Baby Shange.</b>

30:09.489 --> 30:11.391
<b>Started from the bottom,</b>
<b>now we're here.</b>

30:11.424 --> 30:12.826
<b>Okay?</b>

30:12.859 --> 30:16.096
<b>I'm a worker, I know that</b>
<b>I've earned this spot.</b>

30:16.129 --> 30:18.999
<b>And I hope that you guys</b>
<b>knowing me here</b>

30:19.032 --> 30:22.302
<b>and outside this competition</b>
<b>will take into consideration</b>

30:22.335 --> 30:25.171
<b>just the amount of work</b>
<b>that I've put in</b>

30:25.205 --> 30:27.941
<b>and I guess I ain't got nothing</b>
<b>else to say by Halelu!</b>

30:27.974 --> 30:29.476
<b>And please pick me!</b>

30:29.509 --> 30:32.212
<b>I've been straight up with all</b>
<b>the girls in this competition.</b>

30:32.245 --> 30:33.346
<b>On and off camera.</b>

30:33.380 --> 30:34.547
<b>I love y'all, for real.</b>

30:34.581 --> 30:36.583
<b>But, if the girls</b>
<b>don't want me to win,</b>

30:36.616 --> 30:37.584
<b>they're not gonna</b>
<b>put me in the two,</b>

30:37.617 --> 30:39.586
<b>that's just the</b>
<b>way that it is.</b>

30:39.619 --> 30:40.587
<b>That's it.</b>

30:40.620 --> 30:41.688
<b>- Shange, good job</b>
<b>this season.</b>

30:41.721 --> 30:43.223
<b>- Great job, baby.</b>
<b>- Bye, ladies.</b>

30:43.256 --> 30:44.257
<b>- Bye.</b>

30:46.793 --> 30:49.462
<b>- Hi, guys.</b>
<b>- Boo.</b>

30:49.496 --> 30:52.632
<b>- I'm walking into the</b>
<b>deliberation with the jury</b>

30:52.666 --> 30:54.734
<b>and I'm very confident.</b>

30:54.768 --> 30:56.670
<b>I know you thought that</b>
<b>this would throne me.</b>

30:56.703 --> 30:58.004
<b>[laughing]</b>

30:58.038 --> 30:59.339
<b>- Trix, how do you feel</b>
<b>right now?</b>

30:59.372 --> 31:00.874
<b>- I feel good, I feel great,</b>
<b>I feel wonderful.</b>

31:00.907 --> 31:02.042
<b>I really do.</b>

31:02.075 --> 31:03.910
<b>You guys know the first half</b>
<b>of the season</b>

31:03.943 --> 31:05.278
<b>I was pretty, like,</b>
<b>ugh!</b>

31:05.312 --> 31:06.713
<b>But then like, when</b>
<b>I just got it,</b>

31:06.746 --> 31:07.847
<b>it was like,</b>
<b>"Oh my God."</b>

31:07.881 --> 31:09.916
<b>- How does it change</b>
<b>so quickly for you?</b>

31:09.950 --> 31:11.451
<b>- When I fell in the bottom</b>
<b>for the first time,</b>

31:11.484 --> 31:12.986
<b>I sort of emotionally</b>
<b>experienced</b>

31:13.019 --> 31:14.421
<b>the worst thing</b>
<b>that could have happened.</b>

31:14.454 --> 31:17.324
<b>So then I was like,</b>
<b>well, in the next challenge,</b>

31:17.357 --> 31:19.893
<b>I can do whatever I want,</b>
<b>and then it worked.</b>

31:19.926 --> 31:22.228
<b>Having that break in</b>
<b>the middle of the competition</b>

31:22.262 --> 31:24.164
<b>where it just all got</b>
<b>really bad,</b>

31:24.164 --> 31:28.301
<b>it just made me shrug off</b>
<b>every piece of anxiety.</b>

31:28.335 --> 31:30.437
<b>It's okay to get</b>
<b>butterflies in your stomach.</b>

31:30.470 --> 31:33.640
<b>You just teach them to fly</b>
<b>in perfect formation.</b>

31:33.673 --> 31:35.342
<b>- So, out of the top four,</b>

31:35.375 --> 31:37.811
<b>is there anybody that you</b>
<b>would be really proud</b>

31:37.844 --> 31:40.380
<b>to lip sync against</b>
<b>that we should choose?</b>

31:40.413 --> 31:43.049
<b>- I think Shangela is and was</b>
<b>and will always be an All Star,</b>

31:43.083 --> 31:45.719
<b>even before she got her,</b>
<b>because she</b>

31:45.752 --> 31:47.320
<b>didn't even have a very long</b>
<b>run on "Drag Race"</b>

31:47.354 --> 31:48.555
<b>and she did the most</b>
<b>with it.</b>

31:48.588 --> 31:49.656
<b>That's fierce.</b>

31:49.689 --> 31:52.425
<b>- Now I have a way more</b>
<b>devilish question.</b>

31:52.459 --> 31:54.361
<b>- Oh, God.</b>

31:54.394 --> 31:56.196
<b>- If there was a queen</b>
<b>in the top four</b>

31:56.229 --> 31:58.231
<b>who you would chop off</b>
<b>to make it a top three,</b>

31:58.264 --> 32:00.233
<b>who would it be?</b>

32:00.266 --> 32:01.868
<b>- I'm kind of torn</b>
<b>between Kennedy and BeBe</b>

32:01.901 --> 32:03.069
<b>for different reasons.</b>

32:03.103 --> 32:06.206
<b>I think many of us have</b>
<b>shown so much growth</b>

32:06.206 --> 32:08.842
<b>in being off "Drag Race"</b>
<b>for a year, five years.</b>

32:08.875 --> 32:10.110
<b>Two years.</b>

32:10.210 --> 32:11.745
<b>BeBe's been off "Drag Race"</b>
<b>like ten years,</b>

32:11.778 --> 32:13.947
<b>and I don't think the growth</b>
<b>is like ten years of growth.</b>

32:13.980 --> 32:17.250
<b>And then, like Kennedy's</b>
<b>outfit today, for example,</b>

32:17.284 --> 32:20.287
<b>on Season Seven Kennedy's</b>
<b>finale runway</b>

32:20.320 --> 32:21.821
<b>was like a rainbow dress</b>

32:21.855 --> 32:24.691
<b>that was like light years nicer</b>
<b>than the one she wore today.</b>

32:24.724 --> 32:26.693
<b>Sometimes I just think she</b>
<b>doesn't have full perspective</b>

32:26.726 --> 32:27.994
<b>of even her own gifts.</b>

32:29.062 --> 32:32.265
<b>- Your brand is very,</b>
<b>like, stamped.</b>

32:32.299 --> 32:37.203
<b>How can you broaden that</b>
<b>with this title?</b>

32:37.237 --> 32:39.439
<b>- Every since Season Seven,</b>
<b>I have done what RuPaul calls</b>

32:39.472 --> 32:40.974
<b>"Stepping your pussy up."</b>

32:41.007 --> 32:42.609
<b>I went on tour</b>
<b>as a comedian,</b>

32:42.642 --> 32:45.478
<b>topped the iTunes charts</b>
<b>in folk music in drag.</b>

32:45.512 --> 32:47.180
<b>I mean, I went on to</b>
<b>even star in</b>

32:47.180 --> 32:48.348
<b>and develop my own</b>
<b>television show.</b>

32:48.381 --> 32:50.984
<b>And I felt like an All Star</b>
<b>before I got here.</b>

32:51.017 --> 32:52.819
<b>- Oh, we love you, bitch.</b>

32:52.852 --> 32:54.454
<b>- Baby...</b>

32:56.189 --> 32:58.491
<b>- Thank you, guys.</b>

33:01.861 --> 33:04.764
<b>- For me, this competition</b>
<b>is all about transparency.</b>

33:04.798 --> 33:06.199
<b>- Yes.</b>
<b>- And for me,</b>

33:06.199 --> 33:07.534
<b>there are queens that</b>
<b>I want to support</b>

33:07.567 --> 33:11.805
<b>that I feel need this.</b>
<b>- Yeah. I agree.</b>

33:11.838 --> 33:14.474
<b>- To inspire them</b>
<b>to do more.</b>

33:14.507 --> 33:16.810
<b>- And then there's this other</b>
<b>side where it's like,</b>

33:16.843 --> 33:18.578
<b>there are girls who have</b>
<b>really built a brand,</b>

33:18.611 --> 33:20.513
<b>really done</b>
<b>the successful thing,</b>

33:20.547 --> 33:22.949
<b>and then like, how much</b>
<b>of that is like</b>

33:22.983 --> 33:24.184
<b>you're gonna do that anyway!</b>

33:24.217 --> 33:26.019
<b>You're gonna be so successful</b>
<b>either way.</b>

33:26.052 --> 33:27.554
<b>- Exactly.</b>

33:27.587 --> 33:28.688
<b>- All right, well,</b>
<b>I guess it's time to make</b>

33:28.722 --> 33:30.156
<b>the decisions, ladies.</b>

33:39.499 --> 33:40.767
<b>- Silence.</b>

33:40.800 --> 33:43.970
<b>Oh...</b>
<b>Bring back my girls.</b>

33:49.275 --> 33:52.412
<b>- The time has come for us</b>
<b>eliminated queens</b>

33:52.445 --> 33:54.881
<b>to pick the two lipsticks of</b>
<b>who we think</b>

33:54.914 --> 33:58.485
<b>are the top two queens to</b>
<b>lip sync for their legacy.</b>

33:58.518 --> 34:02.589
<b>- I'm picking the queens that</b>
<b>I think will benefit the most</b>

34:02.622 --> 34:05.859
<b>but also have worked their</b>
<b>asses off this entire time.</b>

34:06.993 --> 34:08.962
<b>- I felt like Kennedy was</b>
<b>the person who</b>

34:08.995 --> 34:10.764
<b>statistics wise was</b>
<b>the one</b>

34:10.797 --> 34:12.666
<b>I would've needed to eliminate</b>
<b>instead of myself,</b>

34:12.699 --> 34:16.236
<b>but after seeing what she's</b>
<b>done and listening to her speak,</b>

34:16.269 --> 34:18.104
<b>I feel good I've been able</b>
<b>to, like, step down</b>

34:18.204 --> 34:20.140
<b>and clear the way for her.</b>

34:20.140 --> 34:22.976
<b>- My first choice</b>
<b>is automatic.</b>

34:23.009 --> 34:25.412
<b>My second choice, I'm</b>
<b>a little bit on the fence</b>

34:25.445 --> 34:27.480
<b>with that one, really.</b>

34:27.514 --> 34:29.883
<b>- Having the conversation</b>
<b>with the top four,</b>

34:29.916 --> 34:33.520
<b>it just reinforced</b>
<b>my idea of who I wanted</b>

34:33.553 --> 34:35.622
<b>to continue.</b>

34:35.655 --> 34:37.724
<b>As I'm looking at</b>
<b>the lipsticks, I'm seeing</b>

34:37.757 --> 34:39.359
<b>longtime friends,</b>

34:39.392 --> 34:41.161
<b>people who have worked their</b>
<b>asses off in this business,</b>

34:41.161 --> 34:43.530
<b>but I'm really confident</b>
<b>in my decision</b>

34:43.563 --> 34:46.766
<b>and I think top four is in</b>
<b>for a big surprise.</b>

34:48.001 --> 34:49.970
<b>- After meeting with all</b>
<b>four of the queens,</b>

34:50.003 --> 34:51.671
<b>I completely changed my mind.</b>

34:51.705 --> 34:53.173
<b>However, now that</b>
<b>I'm at the box,</b>

34:53.206 --> 34:55.642
<b>I'm thinking if I don't</b>
<b>trust my gut,</b>

34:55.675 --> 34:57.644
<b>I'm gonna regret it later.</b>

35:00.513 --> 35:01.848
<b>[RuPaul laughs, bell dings]</b>

35:10.055 --> 35:11.356
<b>Welcome, ladies.</b>

35:13.492 --> 35:16.094
<b>Madame forewoman...</b>

<b>has the jury chosen</b>
<b>the final two All Stars</b>

35:21.066 --> 35:24.803
<b>to lip sync for their legacy?</b>

35:24.836 --> 35:26.071
<b>- Yes, Ru.</b>

35:29.374 --> 35:31.610
<b>- Morgan?</b>

35:31.643 --> 35:34.780
<b>You may tell the queens</b>

35:34.813 --> 35:38.550
<b>who you and the jury</b>
<b>have chosen</b>

35:38.584 --> 35:42.387
<b>to lip sync for</b>
<b>their legacy.</b>

35:44.323 --> 35:46.892
<b>- Well, we tallied</b>
<b>up the votes,</b>

35:46.925 --> 35:49.761
<b>and the top two</b>
<b>All Stars are...</b>

35:52.998 --> 35:55.367
<b>Kennedy Davenport...</b>

36:04.176 --> 36:05.744
<b>And Trixie Mattel.</b>

36:16.188 --> 36:19.758
<b>- Shangela, BeBe.</b>

36:19.791 --> 36:24.363
<b>I'm sorry, my dears,</b>
<b>but this is not your time.</b>

36:24.396 --> 36:27.132
<b>You are and</b>
<b>will always be</b>

36:27.165 --> 36:29.001
<b>All Stars.</b>

36:29.034 --> 36:30.135
<b>- Thank you.</b>

36:30.168 --> 36:32.571
<b>- Please step to the back</b>
<b>of the stage.</b>

36:35.307 --> 36:38.543
<b>- You get right there</b>
<b>to the edge,</b>

36:38.577 --> 36:40.545
<b>and then you don't get it.</b>

36:40.579 --> 36:42.614
<b>And it's a horrible feeling.</b>

36:46.551 --> 36:49.388
<b>But the way Ru's</b>
<b>looking at me,</b>

36:49.421 --> 36:52.024
<b>is like, look at</b>
<b>my daughter.</b>

36:52.057 --> 36:54.059
<b>That's my child up there.</b>

36:54.092 --> 36:58.563
<b>And that makes me really,</b>
<b>like, really, really proud.</b>

36:58.597 --> 37:01.266
<b>So, I'ma keep my head up.</b>

37:01.300 --> 37:03.669
<b>I'ma keep it pushing,</b>
<b>and I'ma keep working.</b>

37:03.702 --> 37:04.870
<b>My story's not over.</b>

37:05.971 --> 37:08.640
<b>It's not over, got to</b>
<b>keep going.</b>

37:08.674 --> 37:10.976
<b>- It's so very disappointing</b>

37:11.009 --> 37:12.978
<b>that I was not given</b>
<b>the opportunity</b>

37:13.011 --> 37:16.181
<b>to be able to fight</b>
<b>for that final title.</b>

37:16.214 --> 37:17.482
<b>But I think I've been</b>
<b>an inspiration.</b>

37:17.482 --> 37:18.650
<b>I really do.</b>

37:18.684 --> 37:22.554
<b>And you know what?</b>
<b>I will always be the first.</b>

37:22.588 --> 37:25.524
<b>The original crowned queen.</b>

37:26.959 --> 37:29.494
<b>Kennedy, Trixie.</b>
