00:00.001 --> 00:02.519
There have been sightings
of Bonnet in the Province.

00:02.597 --> 00:04.097
<i>His name was Otter Tooth.</i>

00:04.182 --> 00:05.512
<i>He talked of war,</i>

00:05.642 --> 00:07.142
<i>warning us of our future.</i>

00:07.227 --> 00:09.437
<i>And they began to believe
he was possessed.</i>

00:09.521 --> 00:11.021
<i>Any man choosing
to settle with me</i>

00:11.147 --> 00:13.697
<i>will receive 100 acres.</i>

00:13.817 --> 00:14.987
Good luck to you, Mr. Fraser.

00:15.068 --> 00:16.117
Do you not want 100 acres

00:16.193 --> 00:17.444
for yourself
and your family?

00:17.529 --> 00:19.039
I thank you, but no.

00:19.114 --> 00:21.244
The time has come for you
to fulfill your oath

00:21.366 --> 00:23.366
both to the crown and to me.

00:23.451 --> 00:26.621
Lieutenant Knox and his men
will remain to assist you.

00:26.705 --> 00:30.165
If Tryon wants his Scot,
I'll give him his Scot.

00:30.250 --> 00:34.380
Stand by my hand,
Roger, captain.

00:34.462 --> 00:35.252
Captain?

00:35.380 --> 00:36.630
I know you stay because of

00:36.715 --> 00:38.295
the vow you made to my mother.

00:39.551 --> 00:40.881
I release you from it.

00:40.969 --> 00:42.729

Get off of me!

01:14.711 --> 01:16.211
Show mercy!

01:16.296 --> 01:17.886
I'm begging you, please!

01:20.550 --> 01:22.050
Where was the mercy

01:22.135 --> 01:24.975
when the good folks
here abouts begged for it?

01:26.431 --> 01:28.891
And you are justice
of the peace.

01:28.975 --> 01:31.105
Where was it, eh?

01:31.227 --> 01:33.107
When you painted them
as criminals?

01:37.609 --> 01:40.529
When they couldn't
pay their taxes?

01:43.782 --> 01:45.652
Go to it, lads.

<i>Help!</i>

04:05.673 --> 04:07.093
Help us, please!

04:07.175 --> 04:09.265
Mistress Farrish,
what has happened?

04:09.344 --> 04:10.924
<i>Hurry, please!</i>

04:11.054 --> 04:12.434
Please, he canna breathe!

04:12.514 --> 04:13.634
He's at death's door.

04:13.765 --> 04:15.475
<i>Quickly.</i>

04:18.269 --> 04:20.319
Mama, something's wrong
with Mr. Farrish.

04:20.438 --> 04:21.988
Here, Marsali.
Clear this off.

04:22.107 --> 04:23.107
Lay him down on the table.

04:25.235 --> 04:26.735
Brianna, get me a pillow.

04:29.322 --> 04:31.072
Oh, Lord.

04:31.157 --> 04:32.457
Oh, my Lord.

04:32.534 --> 04:34.244
I canna believe that
'tis come to this.

04:34.327 --> 04:35.997
I've been letting his blood.

04:36.121 --> 04:38.831
I've given him purgatives.
What more could I have done?

04:38.957 --> 04:41.957
Mrs. Bug, get me a bowl
of cold water, please.

04:42.085 --> 04:43.755
Need to cool him down.

04:48.967 --> 04:52.137
Mr. Farrish,
is it your stomach?

04:53.972 --> 04:55.932
Like a knife to my gut.

04:57.225 --> 04:58.855
Lie still.
Lie still.

05:00.145 --> 05:01.565
You gave him purgatives?

05:01.646 --> 05:03.186
How long ago,
and what, exactly?

05:03.314 --> 05:05.814
Uh, two days ago,
his belly was swollen

05:05.942 --> 05:07.152
and he couldn't eat,

05:07.277 --> 05:08.907
so I gave him some
calomel powder

05:08.987 --> 05:10.737
to rid him of noxious matter.

05:10.822 --> 05:13.152
But he got worse,
so you tried blood-letting.

05:13.283 --> 05:15.073
Aye, and some Blue Mass pills.

05:16.786 --> 05:19.286
Mercury.

05:19.372 --> 05:20.992
Does he need more blood let?

05:26.671 --> 05:28.831
No.

05:28.923 --> 05:30.503
I'm sorry.

05:33.011 --> 05:35.261
There's nothing more
I can do, Mrs. Farrish.

05:39.392 --> 05:40.852
You can't help him?

05:42.520 --> 05:44.730
Come, let us leave them.

05:48.902 --> 05:50.192
I'm so sorry.

06:27.941 --> 06:30.401
The governor shared
your dispatches with me.

06:30.485 --> 06:32.405
You'll not take offense,
I hope.

06:32.528 --> 06:34.658
He merely wanted me
to know the lay of the land.

06:37.742 --> 06:39.412
The ground you've trodden
in your search for Fitzgibbons.

06:43.748 --> 06:46.708
He, uh... he merely wanted ye

06:46.793 --> 06:49.923
to get the measure
of the sort of man I am.

06:50.004 --> 06:51.834
Well...

06:51.923 --> 06:52.923
Hmm.

06:55.635 --> 06:57.925
Did ye arrive at an opinion?

07:01.474 --> 07:03.644
A man I am pleased
to break bread with.

07:05.603 --> 07:07.683
An industrious man,
certainly.

07:07.772 --> 07:10.392
Your efforts to cultivate
the land Tryon granted you

07:10.483 --> 07:13.613
are confirmation of your
loyalty to King and country.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.945
You've brought men
and women together.

07:17.949 --> 07:19.329
And your gathering
was proof of that.

07:22.453 --> 07:23.623
Thank ye.

07:28.459 --> 07:29.629
I, uh...

07:30.878 --> 07:33.298
I'll be sure to mention
the affable Lieutenant

07:33.381 --> 07:34.631
in my next dispatch.

07:39.721 --> 07:41.801
I can only hope
one day to be granted

07:41.931 --> 07:45.551
a parcel of land that's half
as prosperous as yours.

07:45.643 --> 07:49.483
Perhaps when we catch
Fitzgibbons and see him hanged.

07:49.605 --> 07:52.235
Perhaps then the governor
would be so kind.

08:27.727 --> 08:29.857
Charming.

08:29.937 --> 08:33.236
These backcountry folk are not
much for manners, are they?

08:33.357 --> 08:34.528
It's only civility
that keeps us all

08:34.650 --> 08:36.190
from killing one another.

08:38.196 --> 08:41.576
No time for manners when
ye've a family to feed.

08:41.698 --> 08:43.909
Maybe you should be glad
he only spat at us.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.115
I have to disagree.

08:46.079 --> 08:48.709
There's always a need
to respect his Majesty's army.

08:48.831 --> 08:51.541
Life's under no obligation
to give us what we expect.

08:52.543 --> 08:54.213
We should take what is offered
and be thankful

08:54.337 --> 08:55.757
it's no worse than it is.

08:55.880 --> 08:57.790
Men like you and me
offer protection

08:57.882 --> 08:59.842
to ensure that
it isn't any worse.

09:00.927 --> 09:03.307
Appears he doesna share your
beliefs in the matter.

09:03.388 --> 09:04.978
Hmm.

09:05.056 --> 09:06.846
And what are your beliefs
in the matter?

09:08.226 --> 09:09.226
Why?

09:10.186 --> 09:13.316
Are ye taking notes
for yer own dispatches?

09:13.398 --> 09:15.198
Recording my words
for posterity?

09:16.275 --> 09:18.235
No, but if I were?

09:21.030 --> 09:24.110
Then I would have
to agree with ye.

09:24.242 --> 09:25.492
Hmm.

09:25.576 --> 09:27.206
You and I united in our aim

09:27.286 --> 09:31.246
of offering protection to those
we've sworn to defend.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.835
I admire a man who puts duty
and honor above all else.

09:39.132 --> 09:41.882
Then ye admire a man
who'd rather starve

09:41.968 --> 09:44.178
than dishonor
his own conscience?

09:45.930 --> 09:48.090
Do I detect some sympathy there
for the Regulators,

09:48.224 --> 09:49.184
<i>Colonel Fraser?</i>

09:50.518 --> 09:51.728
I have sympathy for any man

09:51.811 --> 09:54.221
who canna afford to eat,
Lieutenant,

09:54.313 --> 09:57.193
and yer generosity of coin
tells me ye have some as well.

09:58.192 --> 10:00.772
I do believe it is right
to give to those in need.

10:01.988 --> 10:03.828
Well, I suppose
it is reasonably true

10:03.948 --> 10:05.658
that there is never
a convenient time

10:05.783 --> 10:07.283
for death or taxes.

10:08.703 --> 10:10.453
Now, do I detect some sympathy

10:10.580 --> 10:12.130
with the Regulators,
Lieutenant?

10:17.628 --> 10:19.798
The Regulators have been
rioting Hillsborough.

10:19.881 --> 10:21.041
Are there any wounded?

10:21.132 --> 10:22.672
<i>Aye, a few,</i>

10:22.800 --> 10:24.670
but thankfully captured
three of the bastards.

10:24.802 --> 10:26.132
<i>We should make haste.</i>

10:26.220 --> 10:28.340
Our presence there
will reassure the townsfolk.

10:39.817 --> 10:41.277
<i>Mama?</i>

10:49.869 --> 10:51.669
Came to see if you
needed any help.

10:53.164 --> 10:54.994
Oh, my God.

10:55.082 --> 10:56.752
I know it's difficult
to see someone like this,

10:56.834 --> 10:59.004
but I had to do it.

10:59.128 --> 11:01.388
I had to confirm what
the cause of death was.

11:04.675 --> 11:07.555
Practically,
intellectually, yes.

11:07.678 --> 11:12.518
That makes perfect sense,
in 1969.

11:12.642 --> 11:14.102
Mama, what if
someone finds out?

11:14.185 --> 11:17.395
They won't.
Now, I'll make sure of it.

11:17.522 --> 11:19.022
You know the worst of it all?

11:19.106 --> 11:20.986
His wife accelerated his death.

11:21.067 --> 11:23.317
His appendix burst,
he was in septic shock,

11:23.402 --> 11:27.532
and bacteria in his abdomen
created a serious infection.

11:27.657 --> 11:29.287
Blood-letting
and mercury pills

11:29.367 --> 11:30.707
weren't going to do
a damn thing except...

11:30.785 --> 11:32.665
Kill him faster.

11:33.746 --> 11:36.086
But no one will understand.

11:36.207 --> 11:37.877
Maybe not,

11:37.959 --> 11:41.179
but if I am to keep
people safe here,

11:41.254 --> 11:43.794
then I need to know what's
causing their illnesses.

11:43.881 --> 11:45.881
<i>I can't watch someone
die like this,</i>

11:45.967 --> 11:48.427
knowing that if he'd just
come to me sooner,

11:48.553 --> 11:50.673
then I could have
saved his life.

11:50.763 --> 11:52.513
An appendectomy is...

11:53.057 --> 11:55.147
It's one of the most
straightforward

11:55.226 --> 11:57.726
procedures you can do.

11:57.853 --> 12:00.603
I know how difficult it was
for you to lose him,

12:00.731 --> 12:04.521
but Mama, there is nothing
you could have done.

12:06.737 --> 12:08.987
It's bad enough I'm fighting
the disease...

12:10.741 --> 12:12.531
But I'm also fighting the cure.

12:15.413 --> 12:16.283
I know.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.580
Mom, I'm... I'm... I'm sorry.
I have to get some air.

13:28.944 --> 13:31.734
This is what a world
without civility looks like.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.088
I ken that man.

13:44.168 --> 13:47.338
He's a friend
of the Governor's.

13:47.463 --> 13:48.463
Mr. Fanning!

13:51.425 --> 13:52.805
- Sinclair.
- What?

13:52.885 --> 13:55.305
- Tend the horses.
- Aye, Colonel.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.640
Mr. Fraser.

14:01.727 --> 14:03.977
It's good to see
a familiar face.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.350
Mr. Fanning,

14:06.482 --> 14:08.522
may I acquaint you with
Lieutenant Hamilton Knox.

14:08.651 --> 14:10.941
Mr. Edmund Fanning.

14:11.028 --> 14:12.368
I'm sorry to make your
acquaintance

14:12.488 --> 14:14.078
under such circumstances.

14:14.198 --> 14:15.698
Let's hope they'll improve

14:15.783 --> 14:17.153
now that we have men
stationed in the town.

14:17.243 --> 14:18.953
Thank goodness
you're here.

14:19.036 --> 14:21.036
It's getting worse and worse.

14:21.163 --> 14:23.043
This country
is going to the dogs.

14:23.165 --> 14:25.455
What did they do
to you, Fanning?

14:25.543 --> 14:28.583
Come with me.
I'll show you.

14:36.137 --> 14:38.847
They seized control
of the courthouse.

14:38.931 --> 14:40.301
The honorable Judge Henderson

14:40.391 --> 14:42.891
was forced to hear
their complaint under duress,

14:42.977 --> 14:44.567
then fled for his life.

14:44.687 --> 14:46.897
They meant to kill him?

14:47.022 --> 14:49.272
He certainly had reason
to believe so.

14:50.401 --> 14:51.611
Mr. Evans.

14:53.112 --> 14:54.652
<i>When they
did not receive</i>

14:54.739 --> 14:57.869
their own particular brand
of justice from the court,

14:57.950 --> 14:59.320
they did this.

15:05.624 --> 15:06.914
My God.

15:07.042 --> 15:10.332
Paraded through town
like a boiled goose

15:10.421 --> 15:13.751
for enforcing a tax
they do not want to pay.

15:16.135 --> 15:20.345
In time, ye will wear
yer scars wi' honor,

15:20.431 --> 15:23.551
<i>knowing ye received them
doing your duty.</i>

15:23.642 --> 15:25.102
I pray you're right.

15:25.227 --> 15:28.107
<i>William Hooper
suffered the same fate.</i>

15:28.230 --> 15:30.940
He lies abed as we speak,
unable to move...

15:31.066 --> 15:33.316
and may yet succumb
to his wounds.

15:33.444 --> 15:35.864
Cowardly dogs.

15:35.946 --> 15:38.656
<i>I was beaten
and forced to watch.</i>

15:38.783 --> 15:40.323
Well, they may as well
have blinded me,

15:40.451 --> 15:42.951
for I can face
seeing no more.

15:43.078 --> 15:45.458
They tore apart my house
by the timbers.

15:46.791 --> 15:49.001
<i>I only wish
your wife was with you.</i>

15:49.126 --> 15:51.626
We could surely employ
a surgeon of her skill.

15:57.009 --> 15:59.099
Still feeling that
sympathy, Colonel?

16:02.097 --> 16:04.187
I didna think them
capable of this.

16:06.477 --> 16:08.227
We're told you captured
three of them.

16:08.312 --> 16:09.102
We did.

16:09.188 --> 16:10.648
And they ought to hang!

16:10.773 --> 16:12.773
<i>They will, John.</i>

16:12.858 --> 16:15.408
Providence has brought us
Lieutenant Knox

16:15.486 --> 16:16.616
and Colonel Fraser.

16:18.531 --> 16:21.901
As it happens, we seek one
of the insurgents ourselves.

16:21.992 --> 16:23.612
A leader.

16:23.702 --> 16:26.872
One Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

16:26.997 --> 16:28.877
Do ye ken if he's among
the men ye arrested?

16:28.999 --> 16:32.509
No, but I can
take you to them.

16:32.586 --> 16:33.546
Yes, sir.

16:48.769 --> 16:50.029
Lieutenant.

16:52.690 --> 16:56.160
Do ye, um... do ye need time
to compose yourself?

16:56.235 --> 16:57.565
I could speak with them alone.

16:57.695 --> 16:58.905
No.

16:59.029 --> 17:00.119
Sickened as I am
by their actions,

17:00.197 --> 17:01.697
I will face them.

17:01.824 --> 17:04.204
Mebbe let me have
the first word.

17:04.326 --> 17:06.205
Highlander to Highlander.

17:06.328 --> 17:08.038
It may loosen their tongues.

17:09.498 --> 17:10.458
Mm.

17:11.876 --> 17:13.256
Bring them out.

17:48.412 --> 17:50.242
Thank you, Mr. Fanning.

17:51.081 --> 17:52.791
I'm Colonel James Fraser.

17:52.917 --> 17:55.257
This is Lieutenant
Hamilton Knox.

17:55.336 --> 17:58.136
We're looking
for Murtagh Fitzgibbons,

17:58.255 --> 18:02.965
this leader of yours that
we've heard so much about.

18:03.093 --> 18:04.673
Was he the one who
put ye up to this?

18:09.016 --> 18:12.436
I ken how persuasive
a Highlander can be.

18:12.561 --> 18:14.681
I'm grown out
of the same ground.

18:16.774 --> 18:19.064
And given where ye're standing,

18:19.151 --> 18:20.941
I'll bet ye have got
a few thousand acres

18:21.070 --> 18:23.160
of new ground now.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.280
I have settlers.

18:25.366 --> 18:27.956
Highland folk and others.

18:28.035 --> 18:29.705
Men and women
who depend upon me.

18:29.787 --> 18:31.707
<i>Spoken as a true Laird.</i>

18:31.789 --> 18:34.879
Look at ye
on yer high horses.

18:34.959 --> 18:36.089
Ye're no better than us.

18:36.168 --> 18:37.968
How dare you.

18:38.045 --> 18:40.255
Look me in the eye and tell me
what you did was justified.

18:40.339 --> 18:43.389
Oh, it was more than justified.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.057
Crooked thieves
and extortionists,

18:45.135 --> 18:46.135
all of 'em.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.390
I'm only sorry we didn't bathe

18:47.471 --> 18:49.091
the whole stinkin'
lot of 'em in tar.

18:49.181 --> 18:50.261
Ye canna mean that.

18:50.349 --> 18:53.059
We'll wage war on ye
if we must.

18:53.143 --> 18:55.223
<i>Bring towns down
around yer ears.</i>

18:55.312 --> 18:57.312
<i>Nothing but
white-livered miscreants,</i>

18:57.398 --> 18:59.398
as evidenced by their
repulsive crimes.

18:59.483 --> 19:02.063
Try sayin' that to me again
when my hands are untied.

19:04.488 --> 19:05.788
Where are the rest
of you hiding?

19:07.741 --> 19:08.781
Hmm?

19:09.243 --> 19:10.993
Where is Murtagh Fitzgibbons?

19:11.120 --> 19:12.920
I'd rather bite my own
tongue off then tell ye.

19:17.292 --> 19:19.002
I will remind you
that I am a Lieutenant

19:19.086 --> 19:20.126
in his Majesty's army.

19:20.212 --> 19:21.122
Knox.

19:21.213 --> 19:22.753
He canna help himself.

19:22.840 --> 19:25.260
Blood-red coat,
the color of the devil himself.

19:25.342 --> 19:29.762
If you are truly so brave,
I will ask you one last time.

19:29.847 --> 19:32.937
Where is Murtagh Fitzgibbons?

19:33.017 --> 19:34.437
I am Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

19:39.189 --> 19:40.859
Is that so?

19:42.109 --> 19:43.569
No!

19:44.945 --> 19:45.985
Lieutenant!

19:48.991 --> 19:50.111
What have you done?

19:50.200 --> 19:52.200
Hey!
Hey, come on!

19:59.334 --> 20:02.084
He's dead.

20:02.212 --> 20:03.962
You executed a man
without trial!

20:06.091 --> 20:08.051
Gentlemen?

20:08.135 --> 20:10.095
<i>What happened here?</i>

20:14.808 --> 20:17.728
Aye, sometimes a man
must put aside his honor

20:17.853 --> 20:18.973
to defend himself.

20:23.942 --> 20:25.982
Take these men
back to their cells.

20:51.428 --> 20:54.848
Captain Roger MacKenzie,
at your service.

20:54.932 --> 20:55.932
They're quick.

20:56.058 --> 20:58.268
The whole thing's ridiculous.

20:58.352 --> 21:00.312
The very fact that somehow
I'm a militia captain

21:00.437 --> 21:02.027
that can't shoot,

21:02.106 --> 21:05.026
the fact that I'm aiming at
a squirrel in the first place,

21:05.109 --> 21:08.119
the whole thing goes
against nature, Bri.

21:08.195 --> 21:11.285
It's like shooting
at Tufty Fluffytail.

21:12.282 --> 21:14.492
Um, at what?

21:14.618 --> 21:17.578
Ye've never heard
of Tufty Fluffytail?

21:17.663 --> 21:19.203
Should have known
that reference would be lost

21:19.289 --> 21:21.839
on my American wife.

21:21.959 --> 21:24.299
Tufty is a squirrel

21:24.378 --> 21:27.298
who teaches children
about road safety.

21:27.422 --> 21:31.132
Sort of like your, uh,
Smokey the Bear.

21:31.218 --> 21:34.138
Sort of,
but there are clubs.

21:34.221 --> 21:37.181
Wow, sounds exciting.

21:37.307 --> 21:38.857
I think I'd rather
be in the militia.

21:38.976 --> 21:41.516
Ah, well, I'll confess
that in my time at Oxford,

21:41.645 --> 21:44.935
I hadn't read about brigades
of squirrels on battlefields.

21:49.319 --> 21:51.529
Ye're keeping me occupied
hunting wee rodents

21:51.655 --> 21:53.535
while the real men are away.

21:53.657 --> 21:55.957
What are you talking about?

21:56.034 --> 21:58.624
Da left you here to protect
the ridge while he's gone.

21:58.704 --> 22:00.164
We're practicing.

22:00.289 --> 22:02.629
Protect it from what?
Rabies?

22:04.626 --> 22:06.876
The Regulators pose
no threat to us here.

22:07.004 --> 22:09.134
You know that.

22:09.214 --> 22:11.004
He doesn't respect me, Bri.

22:11.842 --> 22:14.012
It doesn't help matters
that we had Jemmy baptized

22:14.136 --> 22:16.766
by a Presbyterian.

22:16.847 --> 22:19.187
Well, we already had one
heretic in the family,

22:19.308 --> 22:21.398
and two are better than one.

22:22.978 --> 22:23.938
<i>Come on.</i>

22:25.272 --> 22:27.232
Let's try something
that doesn't move.

22:27.357 --> 22:28.607
Aim at that tree.

22:29.776 --> 22:31.026
Are you serious?

22:31.111 --> 22:33.021
Would you just...

22:33.113 --> 22:34.613
A tree.

22:37.326 --> 22:39.366
- What's the...
- Here.

22:41.205 --> 22:42.455
Elbow.

22:49.296 --> 22:50.466
Steady.

22:54.218 --> 22:55.468
Breathe.

22:57.221 --> 22:59.801
Well now it's you
who's driving me nuts.

23:31.171 --> 23:32.751
You want to go back,
don't you?

23:37.928 --> 23:39.138
You're ready.

23:40.055 --> 23:41.055
Who knows?

23:42.724 --> 23:45.394
Maybe I want Jemmy to be part
of the Tufty club.

23:46.561 --> 23:48.681
There are plenty
of squirrels here.

23:48.772 --> 23:50.392
We could pick one,
name him Tufty.

23:50.482 --> 23:52.022
Done.
Welcome to the club.

23:54.820 --> 23:57.080
Look, maybe we should be glad.

23:57.155 --> 23:59.655
Jem doesn't need
road safety here.

23:59.783 --> 24:01.703
At least we know he'll never
be hurt in a car accident.

24:01.785 --> 24:02.955
Brianna.

24:03.954 --> 24:05.414
Our family is here.

24:06.623 --> 24:08.793
You and Jemmy are my family.

24:09.751 --> 24:12.461
James Fraser is my Colonel.

24:13.630 --> 24:15.000
And what about Mama?

24:20.679 --> 24:22.099
You don't want to leave them.

24:44.244 --> 24:45.164
What have I done?

24:47.331 --> 24:49.291
I've become the very
thing I despise.

24:53.378 --> 24:54.338
I'm a hypocrite.

24:56.131 --> 24:57.381
What's done is done.

25:03.847 --> 25:07.017
Ye must try to make
amends, perhaps.

25:09.436 --> 25:12.026
Ensure a fair trial
for the others.

25:12.105 --> 25:14.275
Ah, they will be found guilty
and hanged.

25:18.612 --> 25:21.782
I gave him a soldier's death.

25:24.326 --> 25:25.916
The other two will not
be so lucky.

25:28.038 --> 25:29.708
Tomorrow they will
go to New Bern

25:29.831 --> 25:31.701
to be hanged as proof
of the work we're doing here

25:31.792 --> 25:32.702
to staunch the uprising.

25:32.793 --> 25:34.373
Is that what they deserve?

25:34.461 --> 25:36.291
I gave that man better
than he deserved.

25:42.052 --> 25:44.762
Is there no cause you would
die for, Lieutenant?

25:47.474 --> 25:49.554
We're here, aren't we?

25:49.643 --> 25:52.973
To die for king and country?

25:53.063 --> 25:55.893
For that is an oath
we both have sworn.

25:59.027 --> 26:00.067
Aye.

26:02.155 --> 26:03.115
We have.

26:46.116 --> 26:49.786
- If you need any more help...
- Thank you.

26:54.749 --> 26:56.879
Fergus, would you mind
looking after

26:56.960 --> 26:58.210
the children
for a little while?

26:58.295 --> 26:59.425
I need to speak with Marsali.

26:59.504 --> 27:00.634
Of course.

27:03.133 --> 27:04.303
Thank you.

27:06.470 --> 27:10.230
There's something
I want to show you.

27:11.558 --> 27:14.478
But Marsali,
do you trust me?

27:14.561 --> 27:15.851
Aye.

27:29.075 --> 27:32.285
Now, you promised
you'd let me explain.

27:36.333 --> 27:37.703
Lord, have mercy!

27:37.834 --> 27:38.754
Stop shouting!

27:40.086 --> 27:41.176
Marsali, please.

27:41.254 --> 27:43.504
Deliver us from evil.

27:44.841 --> 27:46.091
Dinna make me say it, Claire.

27:46.176 --> 27:47.636
Dinna make me say it.

27:49.095 --> 27:51.135
Was she right, my Ma?
Was she?

27:51.223 --> 27:52.763
I'm not a witch.

27:52.849 --> 27:54.689
Marsali, you have
more sense than that.

27:54.768 --> 27:57.028
That is why I brought you here.

27:57.145 --> 27:59.525
Now, knowing me as you do
for as long as you have,

27:59.648 --> 28:02.278
why do you think Mr. Farrish
is on this table?

28:05.570 --> 28:07.190
Who did we bury?

28:07.322 --> 28:08.742
No one.

28:08.865 --> 28:11.115
Roger and I filled
the coffin with rocks.

28:11.201 --> 28:13.741
Should a physician not be more
concerned with the living?

28:13.870 --> 28:15.660
The curse of the living
is that they can't tell you

28:15.747 --> 28:16.877
the secrets of the dead.

28:16.998 --> 28:18.758
And what secrets
might those be?

28:18.875 --> 28:21.715
How to save those who
are still here with us.

28:21.836 --> 28:24.546
How to perform
life-saving surgeries.

28:24.673 --> 28:25.923
You know,
we physicians,

28:26.049 --> 28:28.889
we... we learn by practicing
on the dead,

28:28.969 --> 28:31.979
and I think you'd
be a good apprentice.

28:32.055 --> 28:33.555
Now, I've seen you butchering.

28:33.682 --> 28:35.012
You know how to use a knife.

28:35.100 --> 28:36.360
You understand
the parts of an animal

28:36.434 --> 28:37.394
and what they're for.

28:39.104 --> 28:41.484
People are similar
in many ways.

28:41.565 --> 28:43.395
See for yourself.

28:46.069 --> 28:47.239
God help us.

28:48.780 --> 28:49.940
Well, I believe he does.

28:50.824 --> 28:52.704
It's a miraculous thing,
the human body,

28:52.784 --> 28:55.624
and I want to use this body
to teach you

28:55.745 --> 28:58.625
so that we can protect
God's miracle.

28:58.748 --> 29:03.088
Marsali, you are kind
and caring,

29:03.169 --> 29:05.589
and you have
the right instincts,

29:05.714 --> 29:07.254
and I need help.

29:10.552 --> 29:12.262
But ye've...

29:14.055 --> 29:16.395
I could never defile a body.

29:16.474 --> 29:18.434
I didn't defile him.

29:18.560 --> 29:23.150
I did what's called an autopsy
to... to learn why he died.

29:26.610 --> 29:30.330
So ye can find out what killed
a man by cutting him open?

29:30.447 --> 29:31.907
Yes.

29:31.990 --> 29:34.330
Now, I couldn't save
Mr. Farrish,

29:34.451 --> 29:37.281
but this way, his death
will mean something.

29:37.412 --> 29:39.242
Help save others.

29:41.625 --> 29:43.125
And after I finish
teaching you,

29:43.209 --> 29:44.719
we'll stitch him up
and give him a proper burial.

29:44.794 --> 29:45.964
I promise.

29:46.046 --> 29:47.296
Roger even said he would help.

29:48.340 --> 29:49.300
Stitch him up?

29:51.301 --> 29:52.301
Like a seamstress?

30:46.356 --> 30:49.696
Ye've got balls coming
back here, Mr. Fraser.

30:49.776 --> 30:51.236
Or is it Colonel Fraser?

30:51.361 --> 30:53.611
You come to finish us off,
have ye?

30:53.697 --> 30:55.157
If Murtagh had seen ye
standing there...

30:55.240 --> 30:56.370
No.

30:56.449 --> 30:58.289
No, Knox shouldna ha'
done what he did,

30:58.368 --> 31:00.628
but you shouldn't have
tormented those men.

31:00.704 --> 31:02.284
I'm sorry for what happened
to Ethan,

31:02.372 --> 31:03.122
and for my part in this.

31:03.206 --> 31:04.836
What part is that, exactly?

31:04.916 --> 31:06.586
Money, is it?

31:06.710 --> 31:07.970
Tryon's coin?

31:08.044 --> 31:10.044
The governor
has bound me to him.

31:10.171 --> 31:11.381
I'm trying to save
all our lives.

31:11.506 --> 31:12.716
How verra noble.

31:12.841 --> 31:14.251
Ye're not doin'
so well thus far.

31:14.384 --> 31:15.714
Dinna speak to me
of what is noble.

31:15.802 --> 31:17.882
It is a war being waged.

31:18.012 --> 31:19.512
We believe in our cause.

31:19.597 --> 31:21.187
And I believe in mine,

31:21.266 --> 31:24.016
preserving as many lives
as possible.

31:24.102 --> 31:25.262
We dinna have much time.

31:33.737 --> 31:36.237
Redcoats guard the town.

31:38.742 --> 31:40.992
I told Murtagh
be hard to find.

31:41.077 --> 31:42.917
I didna count on his friends
laying a trail

31:42.996 --> 31:44.916
of tar and feathers
to his doorstep.

31:45.039 --> 31:47.419
Murtagh was here with us.

31:50.003 --> 31:51.923
Then tell him not to return.

31:52.046 --> 31:53.756
Knox has an army
at his command.

31:53.882 --> 31:55.172
Across the water, mebbe,

31:55.258 --> 31:57.848
but we have an army
of men here.

31:57.927 --> 32:00.387
Men with nothing left to lose,

32:00.472 --> 32:01.762
and farmers though we be,

32:01.848 --> 32:03.558
we've beat our plowshares
into swords

32:03.641 --> 32:06.471
and are training for battle.

32:06.603 --> 32:08.683
How many men do you have?

32:29.793 --> 32:30.873
I'll be lightin' a candle

32:30.960 --> 32:33.290
for poor mistress Farrish.

32:33.379 --> 32:34.799
Terrible, is it not?

32:34.881 --> 32:36.251
He was so young.

32:36.341 --> 32:38.801
Aye, we say bad things
come in threes,

32:38.885 --> 32:40.635
and did you hear?

32:40.720 --> 32:43.180
My lad Thomas burnt his hand
badly last week at the kiln,

32:43.306 --> 32:45.226
so I'll be sayin'
my prayers tonight.

32:45.308 --> 32:47.688
Put some honey on it,
he ought.

32:47.811 --> 32:48.971
Well, that should help.

32:49.103 --> 32:50.813
It can prevent infection.

32:50.897 --> 32:52.487
D'ye think?

32:52.607 --> 32:53.817
The physician at Cross Creek

32:53.900 --> 32:56.490
told me honey
was fer old wives.

32:56.611 --> 32:59.981
Bartered for some of that
St. James Fever Powder instead.

33:00.073 --> 33:02.113
They say King George
himself uses it.

33:02.200 --> 33:03.000
Oh.

33:03.117 --> 33:05.667
To ingest for a burn?

33:06.830 --> 33:08.290
But the wound is on his hand.

33:08.373 --> 33:09.453
Why risk it?

33:09.541 --> 33:11.001
Well, exactly.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.415
He may as well take it,
if it will help.

33:13.503 --> 33:15.123
<i>Good enough
for the king,</i>

33:15.213 --> 33:16.383
then it's good enough
for my boy.

33:16.506 --> 33:17.676
Mistress Chisolm,

33:17.757 --> 33:19.557
has Thomas been
vomiting at all?

33:19.676 --> 33:21.716
Aye.

33:21.845 --> 33:24.685
St. James Powder
contains antimony.

33:24.764 --> 33:26.094
It's a poison.

33:26.182 --> 33:27.682
<i>It makes you vomit,</i>

33:27.809 --> 33:29.269
which in certain circumstances

33:29.352 --> 33:31.022
can make you feel
better, but...

33:31.104 --> 33:32.684
I mean, if you take
too much of it...

33:32.772 --> 33:34.022
Ye're a fine healer, Mistress,

33:34.107 --> 33:36.197
and we are blessed to have ye,

33:36.317 --> 33:38.817
but Dr. Wilson
is a learned physician.

33:38.903 --> 33:40.323
<i>Here.</i>

33:40.405 --> 33:42.445
Can ye imagine if it was
discovered that the King

33:42.532 --> 33:44.532
was being poisoned
by his own physician?

33:55.962 --> 33:57.792
What are you doing?

33:57.881 --> 34:00.291
Just making a list.

34:00.383 --> 34:02.633
Tips for preventative
healthcare.

34:02.719 --> 34:05.059
Hmm, telling people what to do?

34:05.138 --> 34:07.398
More importantly,
what not to do.

34:07.473 --> 34:09.353
<i>I'm gonna make as many
copies as I can</i>

34:09.434 --> 34:11.264
<i>and hand them out
to all the settlers.</i>

34:11.393 --> 34:13.724
And how are you gonna explain
how you know these things?

34:15.148 --> 34:16.568
Sort of like Otter Tooth,
isn't it?

34:18.318 --> 34:20.068
People even gonna
listen to you?

34:21.070 --> 34:22.070
Hmm.

34:22.155 --> 34:23.824
No, I very much doubt it,

34:23.907 --> 34:26.036
but they will listen
to Dr. Rawlings.

34:26.784 --> 34:29.074
Dr. Rawlings recommends.

34:29.161 --> 34:30.911
And who is Dr. Rawlings?

34:30.996 --> 34:34.257
The man who used to own my
medical kit and my microscope,

34:34.375 --> 34:38.125
and now the good doctor behind
these radical new ideas.

34:38.963 --> 34:40.213
Clever.

34:41.966 --> 34:44.176
All right,
do you have a spare pen?

34:45.178 --> 34:46.768
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

34:49.766 --> 34:51.516
Broken free from without.

34:53.061 --> 34:55.521
Then there may be yet more
traitors in town.

34:57.857 --> 34:59.447
Mr. Fanning,

34:59.567 --> 35:01.737
perhaps you could make
some enquiries?

35:01.819 --> 35:03.159
Of course.

35:10.328 --> 35:12.958
Mebbe this works in our favor.

35:13.039 --> 35:14.749
No doubt those men
will tell Fitzgibbons

35:14.832 --> 35:17.252
what ye're willing to do to
bring an end to this uprising.

35:18.044 --> 35:19.624
We sought but one man.

35:20.838 --> 35:23.218
I fear now that war
is inevitable.

35:24.467 --> 35:25.677
After all,

35:25.802 --> 35:27.632
one man fighting
for his home is worth 100...

35:27.720 --> 35:30.090
100 fighting for pay.

35:31.641 --> 35:32.801
You need more men.

35:39.732 --> 35:41.942
I saw those you called
at your daughter's wedding.

35:43.903 --> 35:45.023
Not enough.

35:48.658 --> 35:50.578
I'll leave tomorrow.

35:50.660 --> 35:51.870
Gather a militia.

35:51.995 --> 35:53.495
Meet me here as soon
as you're able.

35:55.957 --> 35:57.457
Come prepared for war.

36:05.133 --> 36:09.513
T, L, M, S,
G, B, K, V?

36:10.888 --> 36:12.188
Hmm.

36:14.225 --> 36:16.855
Oh, I forgot to ask.

36:16.936 --> 36:18.856
Did Marsali pass the test?

36:18.938 --> 36:20.028
Ah.

36:20.106 --> 36:22.316
Well, I have a new apprentice.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.120
Thank you for helping me
hide the body.

36:25.194 --> 36:27.484
<i>"The Apprentice Under
the Root Cellar."</i>

36:28.656 --> 36:31.366
Surely that's a Nancy Drew
novel begging to be written.

36:32.326 --> 36:34.206
We have another lesson tonight.

36:35.204 --> 36:38.244
Now, look down,

36:38.374 --> 36:40.164
look into the light,

36:40.251 --> 36:41.751
and follow my finger.

36:47.717 --> 36:48.967
Your father,

36:49.052 --> 36:52.842
he was a spitfire pilot
during the war?

36:52.930 --> 36:54.760
Aye.

36:54.891 --> 36:57.051
Jerry MacKenzie.

36:57.185 --> 36:59.435
So he didn't wear glasses?

37:00.688 --> 37:01.648
No.

37:03.024 --> 37:04.484
No, I suppose, as a pilot,

37:04.567 --> 37:06.697
he must have had
perfect vision.

37:06.778 --> 37:10.198
That makes the chances
of a hereditary vision problem

37:10.281 --> 37:11.651
a little less likely.

37:13.201 --> 37:15.071
So what's the verdict?

37:15.203 --> 37:17.833
You're slightly short-sighted
in your left eye,

37:17.914 --> 37:21.914
but nothing that would cause
any real difficulties.

37:22.043 --> 37:23.163
So I'm just a terrible shot?

37:25.171 --> 37:26.881
Maybe it's psychological.

37:26.964 --> 37:28.424
Hmm.

37:28.549 --> 37:30.429
I mean, my father
may have been in the RAF,

37:30.551 --> 37:33.051
but I was raised by a minister.

37:33.137 --> 37:35.437
I don't want to shoot anyone.

37:35.556 --> 37:37.726
Brianna, on the other hand,
she, um...

37:37.809 --> 37:39.109
Have you seen her with a rifle?

37:40.436 --> 37:41.976
Well, she seems
to be making do.

37:43.022 --> 37:44.442
She's happy here.

37:46.609 --> 37:48.569
I think she wants to stay.

37:50.071 --> 37:51.691
And why wouldn't you?

37:51.781 --> 37:53.781
Want to stay, that is,

37:53.908 --> 37:55.788
if you have all of your
family around you?

37:57.203 --> 37:59.283
The Reverend
was the last of mine.

38:00.873 --> 38:03.583
Didn't you tell me you had some
many-times great grandparents

38:03.668 --> 38:05.798
roaming around here
somewhere in America?

38:05.878 --> 38:08.338
Aye.
Aye, I suppose I do.

38:09.423 --> 38:11.053
Though, if we ever
cross paths again,

38:11.134 --> 38:13.014
trying to explain
to Morag MacKenzie

38:13.136 --> 38:15.976
that we're kin may be tricky.

38:18.141 --> 38:20.301
Well, either way,

38:20.434 --> 38:22.644
we're your family, Roger.

38:24.438 --> 38:26.988
As much as I love
all of you being here...

38:28.818 --> 38:30.158
I hope you don't stay.

38:32.155 --> 38:35.115
I would miss you all.

38:35.199 --> 38:36.209
Terribly.

38:37.869 --> 38:41.339
But it's safer in the future
for all three of you,

38:41.455 --> 38:43.545
and I know you feel
the same way.

38:46.627 --> 38:49.717
I'm doing everything I can
to make this a safer time,

38:49.839 --> 38:51.179
but it's not.

38:53.676 --> 38:55.556
It's my fault
that you're all here.

38:57.305 --> 38:59.435
And Jemmy,
he could scrape his knee

38:59.515 --> 39:01.725
and get an infection,

39:01.851 --> 39:03.561
and I don't know
that I could save him

39:03.686 --> 39:07.486
because I don't have something
as simple as an antibiotic.

39:09.859 --> 39:11.659
Well, it's a moot point,
isn't it?

39:14.030 --> 39:16.120
Brianna and I can't go back
until we know

39:16.199 --> 39:17.999
whether Jemmy
can hear those stones.

39:20.703 --> 39:21.913
That could be tomorrow...

39:24.207 --> 39:26.837
Or a year from now.

39:26.918 --> 39:28.128
Or never.

39:41.224 --> 39:43.224
<i>What're yer names?</i>

39:43.351 --> 39:46.561
Bryan Cranna
and Lee Withers.

39:46.646 --> 39:49.316
<i>And the watchword?</i>

39:49.398 --> 39:52.198
If it hasna changed
since we've been imprisoned,

39:52.276 --> 39:54.026
caisteal dhuni.

39:57.949 --> 39:59.959
No, it hasna changed.

40:01.327 --> 40:03.997
Friend Bryan.
Friend Lee.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.090
'Tis good to see
you returned.

40:05.206 --> 40:08.166
Mr. Husband.
Mr. Hunter.

40:08.251 --> 40:10.621
Have you news for us
from Hillsborough?

40:10.753 --> 40:12.373
How is it that you are free?

40:12.463 --> 40:14.213
<i>Where's Ethan?</i>

40:14.298 --> 40:16.468
A sorry tale,

40:16.592 --> 40:18.092
but I'll tell it.

40:20.137 --> 40:21.267
Come.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.048
Though we mourn
the loss of Ethan

40:51.127 --> 40:56.137
and long to avenge him,
my godson's right.

40:56.257 --> 40:58.057
We need to bide our time.

40:58.134 --> 41:01.554
If he's told us that we cannot
return to Hillsborough...

41:01.637 --> 41:03.477
There's good reason.

41:03.556 --> 41:05.596
I ken ye trust him,
Murtagh,

41:05.683 --> 41:10.103
but I canna say
he takes our side.

41:11.772 --> 41:14.102
He's walking between two fires.

41:14.191 --> 41:15.731
And ye?

41:15.818 --> 41:17.988
Wavering between two fires.

41:18.654 --> 41:20.364
Our cause on the one hand,

41:20.489 --> 41:22.999
<i>and your godson on the other.</i>

41:23.075 --> 41:25.865
Where will your allegiance lie
when the time comes to fight?

41:25.995 --> 41:28.455
We pray it does not
come to that.

41:30.916 --> 41:33.006
If it does,
we'll be ready.

41:36.839 --> 41:41.009
I have no say over my godson,

41:41.093 --> 41:43.093
and he has no say over me.

41:43.179 --> 41:44.729
But he stands with the crown.

41:44.847 --> 41:48.107
No, he stands with his people.

41:51.645 --> 41:53.395
And I stand with mine.

41:56.984 --> 41:59.824
He'll fight beside ye
when the time comes, Bryan.

42:01.030 --> 42:02.290
Ye have my word.

42:07.370 --> 42:08.580
<i>She's gone mad, she has.</i>

42:08.704 --> 42:10.624
Up all night baking.

42:10.706 --> 42:14.296
More bread than the Lord
when he fed the multitudes

42:14.377 --> 42:16.047
with the loaves and fishes.

42:18.547 --> 42:19.967
Whoa.

42:20.049 --> 42:21.719
You're not planning
to eat all of that, are you?

42:21.801 --> 42:24.511
No, I'm going
to let it go moldy.

42:25.721 --> 42:28.681
What a terrible waste.

42:33.396 --> 42:34.896
Please tell me
you're being sarcastic.

42:34.980 --> 42:36.730
What, me?

42:36.816 --> 42:37.946
Never.

42:44.240 --> 42:45.450
I'm making penicillin,

42:45.574 --> 42:47.914
or at least
I'm going to try to.

42:49.286 --> 42:50.326
Okay, Mrs. Bug's right.

42:50.413 --> 42:52.833
You have lost your mind.

42:54.250 --> 42:57.630
- You can't do that.
- Yes, I can, I think.

42:57.753 --> 42:59.713
And not just with the bread;
I've sent Marsali out

42:59.797 --> 43:01.597
to gather food scraps
from the neighbors,

43:01.715 --> 43:03.135
things destined
for the pig trough.

43:03.259 --> 43:04.929
With any luck,
I'll find the right strain.

43:05.010 --> 43:06.300
No, Mama,

43:06.429 --> 43:09.439
penicillin isn't invented
for another hundred years.

43:09.515 --> 43:12.855
157, to be precise.

43:14.353 --> 43:16.683
Look, pretending
to be someone else

43:16.772 --> 43:18.812
<i>and writing lists</i>

43:18.941 --> 43:22.611
that go against the accepted
wisdom of the day is one thing,

43:22.695 --> 43:25.905
but this,
it's dangerous.

43:25.990 --> 43:29.040
What if it messes
with some cosmic balance,

43:29.118 --> 43:32.078
or breaks some rule
of space and time?

43:35.583 --> 43:37.123
Isn't this playing God?

43:39.795 --> 43:42.335
You know, Bri,
you played God

43:42.465 --> 43:45.425
when you came back
to save our lives,

43:45.509 --> 43:48.059
and I'm so glad
that you did.

43:48.137 --> 43:49.727
Now, I change the future

43:49.805 --> 43:52.805
every time I save
a person's life here,

43:52.892 --> 43:55.932
and Jamie, even though
he's not a time-traveler,

43:56.020 --> 43:58.190
his very presence here
has affected the future

43:58.314 --> 44:01.564
of a lot of people who
aren't breathing anymore,

44:01.650 --> 44:04.980
and a few who are,
like you...

44:06.947 --> 44:07.867
And Jemmy.

44:09.742 --> 44:12.742
So time, space,

44:12.828 --> 44:15.288
history be damned.

But it's true.

45:03.712 --> 45:06.332
I canna understand

45:06.423 --> 45:08.383
I love that song.

You know that?

45:17.726 --> 45:19.266
Here, I'll take that.

45:19.395 --> 45:20.395
You can sit with Jemmy.

45:25.442 --> 45:27.272
Mm.

45:27.403 --> 45:28.403
Go.

45:28.487 --> 45:30.117
Hi, where you going?

45:30.239 --> 45:31.949
Hey, Jem.

45:32.074 --> 45:33.614
Mm, mm.

45:33.742 --> 45:35.112
I know.

46:22.916 --> 46:25.126
<i>Roger!
Roger, get out here quick!</i>

46:29.089 --> 46:31.969
<i>Da, you missed it,
but Roger, he's walking!</i>

46:32.051 --> 46:34.841
He's walking!
Can you believe it?

46:36.221 --> 46:38.641
Look at our baby!
He's walking!

46:42.186 --> 46:43.396
Hey.

46:44.688 --> 46:46.068
<i>Hey!</i>

46:46.148 --> 46:48.698
<i>I know!</i>

46:50.444 --> 46:51.484
Come on!
Come on!

46:57.409 --> 46:58.749
Oh!

47:00.663 --> 47:02.493
One of these on
the larger girl.

47:02.581 --> 47:03.741
Thank you very much.

47:09.880 --> 47:11.000
<i>That's it.</i>

47:11.131 --> 47:12.961
Put some strength into it!

47:13.050 --> 47:15.890
Mr. Forbes!
Fancy seeing you here.

47:16.011 --> 47:18.221
I'd like to introduce you
to an associate of mine.

47:18.347 --> 47:20.937
May I present
Mr. Stephen Bonnet.

47:22.976 --> 47:24.606
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

47:29.108 --> 47:31.278
A gambling man,
are you, Mr. Bonnet?

47:31.360 --> 47:33.530
I've been known
to bet on the cocks,

47:33.654 --> 47:34.864
but truth be told,

47:34.947 --> 47:36.577
I find the sight
of two women engaged

47:36.699 --> 47:38.709
in such violent combat vulgar.

47:40.536 --> 47:43.626
One claims the other
cost her 20 shillings.

47:43.706 --> 47:46.206
Stole her fancy man
two nights in a row.

47:48.377 --> 47:50.337
Far from bein'
the gentler sex today.

47:50.421 --> 47:55.211
Then again, I'm not one
to pass up a good wager.

47:55.342 --> 47:58.922
My money is on
the stocky damsel.

48:00.431 --> 48:02.971
I put a stake on
the vicious little harlot.

48:05.060 --> 48:07.890
So how is it you know
Mr. Turnbull?

48:08.021 --> 48:11.271
Oh, Mr. Bonnet has facilitated
the transport

48:11.400 --> 48:14.240
of various proprietary goods
for me and many others

48:14.319 --> 48:16.329
who wish to avoid
the King's levies.

48:17.740 --> 48:19.910
He's very discreet
in his dealings.

48:21.076 --> 48:22.416
One good turn.

48:22.494 --> 48:23.954
Indeed.

48:24.079 --> 48:26.669
I'm glad we have...
how shall I put it...

48:26.749 --> 48:29.629
untethered you from your past,
Mr. Bonnet.

48:32.212 --> 48:35.542
It will be a pleasure doing
business with you, Mr. Forbes,

48:35.632 --> 48:36.592
should the need arise.

48:39.344 --> 48:41.304
I'll surely keep that in mind.

48:52.149 --> 48:53.609
<i>Come on!</i>

48:59.531 --> 49:01.241
What did I tell you?

49:01.325 --> 49:03.115
I know a winner
when I see one.

49:03.243 --> 49:05.373
<i>And I know a cheater
when I see one.</i>

49:07.039 --> 49:08.589
Clearly you know that woman.

49:09.625 --> 49:10.955
What are you implying?

49:11.043 --> 49:12.213
You're in league
with the woman.

49:12.294 --> 49:13.964
You knew when she'd go down.

49:14.046 --> 49:16.046
<i>I know who you are,
Mr. Bonnet.</i>

49:16.131 --> 49:18.751
I assure you,
you're quite mistaken.

49:18.842 --> 49:20.462
Damn your eyes, sir.

49:21.428 --> 49:25.018
I prefer to lose with honor
rather than win by trickery.

49:27.643 --> 49:31.103
I think it's you that's
insulted my honor, sir.

49:34.316 --> 49:36.406
Let us settle this
like gentlemen.

49:45.494 --> 49:46.664
Come on, Bonnet!

49:49.998 --> 49:51.088
Come on!

50:05.514 --> 50:07.554
Yield.
Yield.

50:19.236 --> 50:23.156
'Tis not my eyes that
will be damned, sir.

50:36.837 --> 50:38.297
'Tis unlike you, Bonnet.

50:38.380 --> 50:40.290
Why not kill the man outright?

50:41.008 --> 50:42.928
I considered it,

50:43.051 --> 50:44.921
but I must set
a better example.

50:47.806 --> 50:48.936
I'm a father now.
