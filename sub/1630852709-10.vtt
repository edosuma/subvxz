00:09.551 --> 00:11.594


00:11.678 --> 00:14.097


00:23.815 --> 00:26.276


00:32.323 --> 00:34.284


00:34.367 --> 00:37.454


00:38.204 --> 00:40.957


00:41.708 --> 00:45.628


00:45.712 --> 00:49.591


00:52.093 --> 00:54.304
This is so cool. Check this out.

00:54.387 --> 00:59.309


01:18.161 --> 01:19.662
Hey, excuse-- Oh!

01:19.746 --> 01:21.372
If you could just-- Whoa!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.124
Aah! Aah!

01:34.511 --> 01:35.637
Ah!

01:35.720 --> 01:37.722
Alone time at last.

01:41.142 --> 01:42.644
Ugh!

01:45.021 --> 01:46.022
Oh!

01:46.105 --> 01:48.691
It was so nice up there!

01:56.032 --> 01:57.534
Ooh! French vanilla!

02:02.747 --> 02:04.415
Hey, Bomb. What you up to?

02:04.499 --> 02:06.376
Uh… nothing.

02:06.459 --> 02:09.546
You were up there for so long,
I taught myself to speak in belches!

02:09.629 --> 02:12.590
It looked awesome.

02:12.674 --> 02:14.175
Ha! Nice one.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.846
You know what would make this awesomer?
If we used more trampolines, we could--

02:17.929 --> 02:19.931
Stay in the air even longer!

02:20.014 --> 02:21.724
Uh, guys?

02:22.559 --> 02:24.686
Here… we… go!

02:24.769 --> 02:27.397
-Wow!
-Whoo!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.572
Hey, check it out.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.408
Ping-pong table, yes!

02:38.491 --> 02:41.327
Way better than my
idea to bring my pet anvil, Jerry.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.037
Waah!

02:44.330 --> 02:46.332
This is chicken amazing!

02:46.416 --> 02:49.460
Well, I don't think it's that amazing.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.589
Uh, you're right, Bomb.
We're not thinking big enough!

02:52.672 --> 02:55.174
We need to take bombing to the next level!

02:55.800 --> 02:56.759
Bombing.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.639
Basebird, batter up!

03:01.723 --> 03:04.058
Bottom of the ninth, bases loaded!
Two outs.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.644
Stella McStellerson, ready to swing?

03:06.728 --> 03:08.855
Is that what you think my last name is?

03:08.938 --> 03:12.692
<i>Swing, batter, batter, batter</i>
<i>Sa-wing, batter!</i>

03:16.321 --> 03:17.322
Nice catch.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.964
I don't care how, Harold,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.759
but those sticky notes
better be sticky again

03:37.842 --> 03:39.302
by the time I get back!

03:39.802 --> 03:42.847
How does someone even un-sticky
sticky notes?

03:47.101 --> 03:48.269
Where is everybody?

03:51.064 --> 03:54.567
Hello? Anybody there?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.403
The campers. They're gone!

03:57.487 --> 03:59.530
What's happening?
Why does my face feel funny?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.075
I'm-- I'm smiling!

04:02.158 --> 04:03.701
Harold!

04:05.453 --> 04:08.957
Hey, Rod! Just the bird I was looking for!

04:09.040 --> 04:11.292
FYI, I still have zero respect for you,

04:11.376 --> 04:14.128
but this bombing craze
you Freaks and Beaks came up with

04:14.212 --> 04:15.755
is actually pretty cool.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.382
You hear that, Bomb?

04:17.465 --> 04:21.302
Even Neider-jerk thinks your bombing
is the bomb! Bomb?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.262
Bomb?

04:23.513 --> 04:24.347
Where'd he go?

04:24.430 --> 04:25.932
He was here a second ago.

04:26.015 --> 04:28.017
I'm gonna miss him so much!

04:29.560 --> 04:31.187
I already forgot what he looks like.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.815
He's gotta be here somewhere.
Let's split up and look.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.818
Bomb, quit messing around! Where are you?

04:38.069 --> 04:40.321
Hey, Mighty Eagle. Have you seen Bomb?

04:40.405 --> 04:43.574
Negatory, little dude.
I'm thoroughly focused on my tan here.

04:43.658 --> 04:46.035
Got to be careful this close to the sun.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.665
Bomb! Bomby?

04:50.748 --> 04:53.626
Bomb-ity Bomb-ity, Bomb Bomb Bomb?
Where you at?

04:53.710 --> 04:54.585
There!

04:55.461 --> 04:56.671
-Bomb!
-Bomb!

04:57.338 --> 04:58.464
What are you doing?

04:58.548 --> 05:02.260
Shouldn't you be in the air,
basking in the glory that is bombing?

05:02.343 --> 05:04.971
-Uh, no, thanks.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.807
You see, the thing I enjoyed
about bombing was--

05:07.890 --> 05:10.435
Soaring through the air
with the wind tickling your butt feathers?

05:10.518 --> 05:13.438
The fact that you can go to the bathroom
anywhere?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.233
What?

05:17.317 --> 05:19.444
No, I-- I--

05:19.944 --> 05:21.821
I just wanted to be by myself.

05:21.904 --> 05:25.908
Great idea! Let's all be by ourselves…
together!

05:26.576 --> 05:28.619
I don't think that's what he wants.

05:28.703 --> 05:32.332
No, no, no!
I-I do like hanging out, I do!

05:32.415 --> 05:35.168
I just don't want to do it all the time.

05:35.251 --> 05:37.295
I just wanted some me time.

05:37.378 --> 05:41.257
And bombing was your way
of getting away from it all.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.760
Oh, and we ruined it for you!

05:44.385 --> 05:47.430
This makes me so mad! At myself!

05:47.513 --> 05:49.807
Why didn't you tell us?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.310
I didn't want you to think I was weird.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.980
Oh, Bomb, no matter what,
we'll always think you're weird!

05:57.899 --> 06:00.568
Don't worry, buddy. We're gonna fix this!

06:00.651 --> 06:05.156
We're gonna go up there and tell everyone
bombing is just for Bomb!

06:18.002 --> 06:19.212
Uh, hey!

06:19.295 --> 06:24.383
So, just found out Bomb would rather
do this whole bombing thing on his own,

06:24.467 --> 06:27.887
so if you could kindly just stop,
that'd be great!

06:27.970 --> 06:28.930
Please?

06:32.391 --> 06:34.268
Bombing's done, Terrence, hand it over.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.021
On the other hand,

06:37.105 --> 06:39.482
who am I to get in the way
of true art?

06:39.565 --> 06:41.400
So raw and evocative!

06:41.484 --> 06:43.611
I love it!

06:44.195 --> 06:45.363
Nobody's listening!

06:45.446 --> 06:48.783
Why would they?
Bombing is the best thing ever!

06:48.866 --> 06:51.953
Unless we come up with something better!

06:56.332 --> 07:01.462
Hey, everyone! Forget bombing,
this is so much cooler!

07:01.546 --> 07:03.506
It's called chucking.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.511
Check this out!

07:13.266 --> 07:16.144
-Oh…
-Oh!

07:16.227 --> 07:19.856
So, who wants to go first?

07:22.608 --> 07:26.571
Red, your terrible idea isn't working!

07:26.654 --> 07:29.449
Okay! I've got another one,

07:29.532 --> 07:32.160
but you're not gonna like it.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.164
Oh, you're serious.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.041
Stop. Why would I want everyone to stop?

07:39.125 --> 07:43.671
With the campers out of the way,
I'm turning the camp into a golf course.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.841
Now if you'll excuse me, let her rip!

07:53.097 --> 07:54.265
Our cabin!

07:54.348 --> 07:56.434
No! Jerry was in there.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.769
Jerry! Are you okay?

07:58.853 --> 08:01.355
Oh! Everything's fine, never mind.

08:01.439 --> 08:04.066
Let's go smash down the dining hall.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.945
Say bye-bye to the lumpy mashed potatoes,
chickadees.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.451
Ugh! I like my mashed potatoes lumpy!

08:13.534 --> 08:15.411
If we stop bombing, we stop Lynette.

08:15.495 --> 08:18.372
But bombing's become
an unstoppable force of nature!

08:18.456 --> 08:23.294
Well, if we can't make it less popular,
what if we made it more popular?

08:23.920 --> 08:27.882
First, you don't want anyone to bomb,
now you want everyone to bomb!

08:27.965 --> 08:30.343
I'm so confused!

08:30.426 --> 08:32.053
No, Bomb's right!

08:32.136 --> 08:36.098
What if it got so crowded up there,
everyone felt the same way Bomb does!

08:49.862 --> 08:51.739
Whoa! Whoa!

08:54.408 --> 08:55.952
Are you paying attention, Harold?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.828
This is where you'll be cleaning
the golf carts.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.624
Whoa! Whoa!

09:03.668 --> 09:06.379
Where is everyone? This is an outrage!

09:06.462 --> 09:08.589
Harold, do something!

09:09.715 --> 09:11.217
I am, dear.

09:16.347 --> 09:17.306
It's working!

09:17.390 --> 09:20.017
Oh! But it's still not uncomfortable
enough!

09:20.518 --> 09:23.104
Let me take care of that.
Hey, Lynette, heads up!

09:23.688 --> 09:26.148
What the-- I will not stand for this!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.821
Harold, get back down there, now!

09:32.280 --> 09:34.865
And you lazy oafs,

09:34.949 --> 09:39.036
I am not paying you a barely livable wage
to slack off!

09:39.120 --> 09:40.997
This is-- This is--

09:41.080 --> 09:43.749
This is actually quite fun.

09:48.045 --> 09:50.298
Harold, I'm smiling again!

09:50.381 --> 09:54.844
You know, all of a sudden,
I'm not feeling this bombing thing.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.513
Hey, remember when bombing was cool?

09:57.597 --> 09:59.849
Not really. You want to try chucking?

10:03.227 --> 10:04.854
It worked, we did it!

10:05.521 --> 10:06.480
All right!

10:09.900 --> 10:10.735
Huh?

10:10.818 --> 10:12.111
Where is everybody?

10:14.530 --> 10:16.574


10:17.992 --> 10:20.161
Thanks for getting my alone time back.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.414
Next time, don't be afraid to tell us
you need a little Bomb time.

10:23.497 --> 10:26.500
We're… good… with… that.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.252
Man, you're so good at that.
