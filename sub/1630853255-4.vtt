(shouting)

00:09.760 --> 00:10.761
(barks)

00:13.431 --> 00:14.599
CANCHE:
You fucking come at me?

00:14.599 --> 00:15.700
Dad.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.102
At my fucking kid?

00:17.102 --> 00:19.604
What happened
to the great El Padrino?

00:19.637 --> 00:21.106
MARCUS:
Your flash.

00:22.273 --> 00:23.708
The future of this club

00:23.774 --> 00:24.975
starts today.

00:25.009 --> 00:26.277
EZ:
Where's Gaby?

00:26.311 --> 00:27.645
It's better this way.

00:27.678 --> 00:29.114
-What did you say?
-Let her go.

00:29.147 --> 00:30.315
JOKER:
Happy's been fucked

00:30.348 --> 00:32.283
ever since Montez bailed.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.451
BOSTON TERRY:
Montez is as much of a brother

00:33.484 --> 00:34.785
as anyone in this fucking room.

00:34.819 --> 00:36.121
DOC:
That ain't true.

00:36.121 --> 00:38.489
If it was,
he'd be in this fucking room.

00:38.523 --> 00:39.957
And the Mayans?

00:39.990 --> 00:42.793
There ain't no appetite for war.

00:43.661 --> 00:45.296
JESS:
I found something
and I don't know what to do.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.468
El Banquero needs us.

00:50.468 --> 00:52.137
If we pull this off,

00:52.137 --> 00:55.473
-we'll be fully in bed with him.
-I can do it.

00:55.473 --> 00:56.974
I'll go with the Reyes brothers.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.476
MANNY:
I think this is our package.

00:58.509 --> 00:59.744
Can't bring a kid, man.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.346
This is Noah, and leaving him

01:01.379 --> 01:02.747
-is nonnegotiable.
-CANCHE: It's all right.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.315
We got you.

01:04.349 --> 01:05.683
NOAH:
I don't want to.

01:05.716 --> 01:06.817
-RANDALL: It's our
little secret.
-No.

01:06.817 --> 01:07.885
-Please.
-What the fuck?

01:08.719 --> 01:10.355
-(gunshot)
-(Noah screams)

01:10.388 --> 01:12.190
EZ:
Angel, what the fuck did you d?

01:12.223 --> 01:14.159
What the fuck did you do?!

01:16.527 --> 01:18.529
-(insects trilling)
-(Randall gasping)

01:26.371 --> 01:29.174
(insects trilling)

01:29.174 --> 01:31.176
(Randall panting, groaning)

01:33.178 --> 01:35.045
EZ:
Fuck.

01:35.079 --> 01:36.681
I had no choice. He was...

01:36.714 --> 01:38.949
-You did the right thing.
-I know I did the right thing!

01:39.016 --> 01:41.252
(groaning)

01:43.188 --> 01:45.122
We can't just leave his dad
out here.

01:45.190 --> 01:46.857
NOAH:
He's not my dad.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.025
He's my friend.

01:48.058 --> 01:50.395
He said
we were going on an adventure.

01:55.099 --> 01:56.534
This is gonna be bad, Angel.

01:56.567 --> 01:58.703
I know it's fucking bad.
What the fuck do we do, then?

01:58.703 --> 02:00.871
-(gunshot)
-(screaming)

02:01.906 --> 02:03.808
MANNY:
Let the coyotes take care
of this piece of shit.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.376
Sun's coming up.

02:05.410 --> 02:06.644
We'll drop the kid off.

02:06.711 --> 02:07.912
He can call his parents.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.084
Fuck.

02:15.886 --> 02:17.888
-(insects trilling)
-(chickens clucking in distance)

02:24.562 --> 02:26.731
(footsteps approaching)

02:26.764 --> 02:28.766
*

02:39.244 --> 02:42.247
-(twig snaps)
-(rapidly departing footfalls)

02:45.250 --> 02:47.652
*

03:06.304 --> 03:07.805
COCO:
You good?

03:09.940 --> 03:11.842
You want some breakfast?

03:14.312 --> 03:15.613
(bowl rattles)

03:15.646 --> 03:17.615
I got to get to it.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.284
-Hey.
-Hmm?

03:19.284 --> 03:20.951
Do you think
you could pick me up tonight?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.120
You don't even like
riding the bike.

03:24.522 --> 03:26.324
I, um...

03:26.357 --> 03:28.293
I just don't like
walking home alone.

03:28.326 --> 03:29.694
It's sketchy.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.697
Got a lot to do.

03:33.698 --> 03:35.666
Mm. (kiss)

03:37.134 --> 03:38.469
But I don't see why not.

03:38.469 --> 03:40.838
(chuckles)

03:40.871 --> 03:41.839
Promise?

03:41.872 --> 03:43.341
Yeah.

03:43.374 --> 03:44.975
I promise.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.644
But I got to go.

03:51.349 --> 03:53.318
-Crazy ass.
-(laughs)

03:53.351 --> 03:54.885
(chuckles)

03:59.357 --> 04:00.558
(door closes)

04:06.564 --> 04:08.333
(sighs)

04:17.875 --> 04:19.877
(chickens clucking in distance)

04:27.718 --> 04:29.186
(grunts)

04:41.532 --> 04:43.534
(wind blowing)

05:07.458 --> 05:09.460
(insects trilling)

05:20.605 --> 05:22.072
(trowel scrapes)

05:24.575 --> 05:25.576
(rock clanks)

05:34.485 --> 05:36.487
*

05:43.928 --> 05:45.763
Who pulled the trigger?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.369
Who pulled the fucking trigger?!

05:52.437 --> 05:53.471
I did.

05:54.772 --> 05:57.307
Fucker, I did.

05:57.341 --> 05:59.777
I made sure
the motherfucker was dead.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.281
I was the ranking officer there.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.783
It was my call.

06:07.317 --> 06:08.819
It's on me.

06:08.853 --> 06:13.123
This is who you give power to?

06:13.157 --> 06:15.159
This is who you trust?

06:16.160 --> 06:18.796
What the fuck am I supposed
to tell El Banquero?

06:20.965 --> 06:23.634
You tell him we don't run
protection for kid touchers.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.470
Hurting kids...

06:27.371 --> 06:29.039
You all did the right thing.

06:31.041 --> 06:32.710
(clangs)

06:33.878 --> 06:37.648
What they did, Padrino,
is kill the pipeline.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.551
And maybe every motherfucker
in this room.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.094
Santo Padre.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.562
Hang back.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.432
There's one more thing.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.367
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

06:57.401 --> 06:59.169
There ain't no fucking way!

06:59.169 --> 07:00.538
* Be clear, we here,
and now you can't ignore it *

07:00.571 --> 07:02.172
That's my new prospect.

07:02.206 --> 07:04.208
* We don't ever show it,
we got to go *

07:04.241 --> 07:05.676
* Go, you already know it *

07:05.676 --> 07:08.212
Anybody got a problem with that,

07:08.245 --> 07:09.847
you can take it up with me.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.348
* Change that *

07:11.381 --> 07:12.349
Good.

07:12.382 --> 07:14.384
* Play that, if you know *

07:14.418 --> 07:16.621
* You better stay back,
back up *

07:16.687 --> 07:18.188
All right then,
you French-braided little bitch,

07:18.188 --> 07:20.290
get the fuck behind that bar
and get me a beer then.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.626
Go!

07:21.692 --> 07:22.627
* You take a break *

07:22.693 --> 07:24.194
Faster, prospect!

07:25.395 --> 07:27.698
Sad fucking day
when we start letting

07:27.698 --> 07:30.067
SoundCloud rapper-looking
motherfuckers in here.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.569
* Go... *

07:31.602 --> 07:34.805
* Go, go, go, go, go, go... *

07:34.872 --> 07:36.574
What's up?

07:36.607 --> 07:37.742
It's time for you to pack up.

07:37.775 --> 07:39.644
Time to come home.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.579
This about that bullshit
in the desert?

07:41.612 --> 07:43.648
We sent you down here
to keep an eye on things.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.150
MANNY:
All due respect,

07:46.216 --> 07:48.553
I thought you sent me down here
to help repair things.

07:48.586 --> 07:50.921
You did that a little
too good, brother.

07:52.623 --> 07:56.160
It's time for you
to come back to Yuma,

07:56.226 --> 07:58.763
your true family.

07:58.796 --> 08:00.497
* Limitations, instead *

08:00.565 --> 08:01.666
* Take that feeling
when you're anxious... *

08:01.732 --> 08:04.068
Yeah.

08:04.068 --> 08:06.003
-(indistinct conversation)
-(pool balls clacking)

08:06.070 --> 08:08.573
MAN:
Sup, man?

08:08.573 --> 08:12.109
Looks like I get to go see
my lady and kid a little sooner.

08:12.142 --> 08:14.278
Aw, shit, man. Congrats.

08:14.311 --> 08:16.280
* On your mark... *

08:16.313 --> 08:18.616
Didn't want it like this, but...

08:18.649 --> 08:20.450
fuck it, you know?

08:20.484 --> 08:21.952
Wouldn't change a fucking thing.

08:21.986 --> 08:24.755
Except maybe getting stabbed
and kicked off a roof.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.957
You know, could've done
without that shit, and maybe...

08:26.991 --> 08:29.093
I don't know, maybe being stuck
in the desert

08:29.126 --> 08:31.028
with a fucking pedophile,
but that's just me.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.698
-At least it wasn't boring.
-Yeah.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.299
* Keep up... *

08:35.332 --> 08:36.767
You're a good dude, EZ Reyes.

08:36.801 --> 08:39.303
* You got to go, come on... *

08:39.336 --> 08:41.806
-You, too, Manny.
-(grunts)

08:41.839 --> 08:44.108
* You got to go, come on... *

08:44.108 --> 08:46.644
(door opens)

08:46.677 --> 08:48.813
* You got to go, come on... *

08:48.846 --> 08:50.047
(door closes)

08:50.114 --> 08:51.982
* Get ready *

08:52.016 --> 08:54.384
* You got to go, on your *

08:54.451 --> 08:55.986
* Mark. *

08:56.020 --> 08:57.021
(door closes)

09:03.694 --> 09:06.463
You wanted to see me?

09:06.496 --> 09:08.132
Sit down.

09:13.303 --> 09:14.304
(clears throat)

09:15.706 --> 09:18.909
I want you to know that
I've been watching you.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.245
Keeping your head down.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.748
Putting in the work.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.883
Staying clean.

09:27.351 --> 09:29.486
I'm just trying to get right
w-with the club.

09:29.519 --> 09:31.221
The club.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.659
The club is all of us.

09:34.659 --> 09:36.661
Not one person. Not one charter.

09:37.862 --> 09:39.864
These selfish fucks putting in
their own resentments,

09:39.897 --> 09:42.199
their own bullshit first,

09:42.232 --> 09:45.035
threatening to destroy what
better men than them have built.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.774
Are you here to build,

09:49.840 --> 09:52.509
or are you here to destroy?

09:58.716 --> 10:00.685
I'm sending you to Oakland.

10:01.919 --> 10:05.856
Be a representative for us,
for the Fallen Brothers.

10:05.856 --> 10:07.524
Help build a bridge
between Santo Padre

10:07.557 --> 10:08.893
and the rest of the club.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.595
You good with that?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.634
Fuck yeah, I am.

10:17.702 --> 10:19.269
Good.

10:22.873 --> 10:23.874
And Coco.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.376
You get this right,

10:26.376 --> 10:27.812
your bottom rocker
might be waiting for you

10:27.878 --> 10:28.913
when you get back, huh.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.384
Gracias, padrino.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.886
(Marcus speaks Spanish)

10:51.936 --> 10:53.904
Hey. Can I get another,
sweetheart?

10:53.938 --> 10:56.073
* Deep down it's darker
than me... *

10:56.073 --> 10:57.574
CIELO (whispers):
Jess and I usually
start watering it down

10:57.607 --> 10:58.743
when he gets like this.

10:58.743 --> 10:59.910
* I'm jet black... *

10:59.944 --> 11:01.578
That's weird,

11:01.611 --> 11:04.681
'cause he looks like
a grown-ass man to me.

11:04.749 --> 11:05.783
You got it.

11:05.816 --> 11:07.184
* Away from the light... *

11:07.251 --> 11:09.519
Just say when.

11:09.586 --> 11:13.023
* Jet black, jet black... *

11:13.090 --> 11:14.091
When.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.963
* You think you're running
from me *

11:21.331 --> 11:25.302
-(chuckles)
-* Time's running out,
and I agree. *

11:28.272 --> 11:29.940
Hey.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.880
What happened out there
is on me.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.281
Wasn't Manny's fault.

11:37.314 --> 11:38.648
No shit.

11:38.682 --> 11:39.950
Yeah, well, if I had to guess,

11:39.950 --> 11:41.451
I'd say it was your
idiot fucking brother.

11:43.353 --> 11:44.488
You're the one
who put us out there,

11:44.521 --> 11:45.890
with a kid getting raped
in the desert.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.325
Oh, now you're a fucking
advocate for child safety?

11:50.127 --> 11:52.396
Listen. I'm willing to put

11:52.462 --> 11:54.965
whatever you and I got going on
between us behind us.

11:56.801 --> 12:00.570
This club has a lot
of rebuilding to do.

12:00.637 --> 12:01.806
We're not gonna accomplish that

12:01.839 --> 12:03.207
if you and I are
at each other's throats.

12:05.542 --> 12:08.645
This guy, El Banquero,

12:08.678 --> 12:11.148
-there's got to be a way...
-Oh, you want to help?

12:12.482 --> 12:13.984
Right? You want to,
you want to help me

12:14.018 --> 12:17.754
like you helped your president?

12:17.822 --> 12:20.324
'Cause last I saw, he was in
there drinking himself to death

12:20.357 --> 12:22.492
while you're out here
wearing his flash.

12:22.492 --> 12:25.195
Now, let's get something clear.

12:25.229 --> 12:27.664
You hurt my kid.
I'll never forgive that.

12:27.697 --> 12:30.767
I don't give a fuck
how many accolades

12:30.835 --> 12:33.003
or patches
Alvarez decorates you with,

12:33.003 --> 12:35.739
you'll never be nothing
but a walking dead man to me.

12:41.846 --> 12:44.949
Don't let me catch you slipping.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.451
OTERO:
We got to go, dog.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.119
Now, if you'll excuse me,

12:49.186 --> 12:51.521
I got to go clean up
your fucking mess.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.364
(motorcycles revving)

13:06.770 --> 13:08.705
He's got to let that shit go.

13:08.738 --> 13:10.140
Everything that happened
between us...

13:10.207 --> 13:12.242
-Stop.
-What?

13:14.078 --> 13:15.779
Sit.

13:26.924 --> 13:28.926
Do you know why I made you VP?

13:34.464 --> 13:35.900
I don't.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.569
'Cause you have a good idea

13:39.603 --> 13:41.405
of what this club could be.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.674
But you don't understand this.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.843
Who we are. Who we come from.

13:46.911 --> 13:49.579
The rules and why we have them.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.748
I started this thing

13:51.748 --> 13:54.919
because we wanted something
that belonged to us,

13:54.919 --> 13:57.687
and we fought
tooth and nail for it.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.524
But you have to understand this

14:00.590 --> 14:03.760
to truly understand what it is
to wear that kutte.

14:08.832 --> 14:11.868
As my friend Jax once said,

14:11.936 --> 14:14.604
"Forget the past,

14:14.604 --> 14:16.506
and you're doomed to repeat it."

14:25.149 --> 14:26.650
Santayana.

14:29.453 --> 14:30.520
What?

14:33.323 --> 14:35.125
(sighs)

14:35.159 --> 14:37.461
It wasn't your friend.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.729
It was Jorge Santayana
who said that.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.299
Just read the fucking book.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.138
(door slides open)

14:50.174 --> 14:52.042
(door slides closed)

15:01.718 --> 15:03.587
Hey, watch it.

15:03.653 --> 15:04.989
Sorry, Taza.

15:05.022 --> 15:08.692
You good, Jess?
You, uh, still feeling sick?

15:08.725 --> 15:10.760
No.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.496
I'm better now.

15:12.529 --> 15:14.331
Thanks, Hank.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.269
I don't even recognize
this place anymore.

15:19.336 --> 15:21.538
What the fuck's happening
to this club?

15:21.571 --> 15:23.673
We're being tested.

15:26.876 --> 15:28.678
I'm not sure
we're gonna make it.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.682
Man, this is the last
fucking place

15:32.682 --> 15:34.284
I want to be
for Fallen Brothers.

15:34.351 --> 15:37.054
We should be in Oakland

15:37.087 --> 15:39.523
with everyone else
from the mother chapter.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.026
Being here's a fucking insult.

15:42.759 --> 15:44.461
Oy, man.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.030
Fucking finally.

15:46.063 --> 15:47.531
Damn!

15:48.898 --> 15:51.035
-(sighs)
-Hey.

15:51.068 --> 15:53.303
If you're not feeling 100,
you can go home.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.904
-No, I should stay...
-I got it.

15:54.938 --> 15:57.041
Seriously, go home.

15:57.041 --> 15:58.875
Yeah, okay. Thanks, Cielo.

16:01.745 --> 16:03.747
(dog barking in distance)

16:07.751 --> 16:10.154
(line ringing)

16:10.220 --> 16:11.588
Hey.

16:11.621 --> 16:13.057
I can't fucking do this.

16:13.090 --> 16:15.425
The fuck do you mean?

16:15.459 --> 16:17.827
JESS (over phone):
I'm fucking scared, man.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.564
They're gonna find out,
and if they do...

16:20.564 --> 16:22.399
Get your shit together, Jess.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.069
Stop fucking bitching
and keep your ears open.

16:25.102 --> 16:26.503
If you hear anything...

16:26.570 --> 16:28.772
I may have heard something.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.909
One...

16:32.942 --> 16:34.911
Two...

16:34.911 --> 16:36.246
Three.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.084
(grunts)

16:40.117 --> 16:42.286
-(laughs) Oh, shit.
-Mm.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.088
(grunts)

16:44.121 --> 16:46.123
Mm.

16:46.156 --> 16:48.258
You can't keep up
with me, old man.

16:48.292 --> 16:50.860
(laughs) Shit, I'll keep up
with you all night.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.362
Oh, yeah?

16:52.429 --> 16:55.265
Well, we'll see about that.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.635
Hey, Bish. Can we talk?

16:59.936 --> 17:01.638
Hey, hey.

17:03.973 --> 17:06.776
What could we possibly
need to talk about, EZ?

17:09.012 --> 17:11.781
Hey, you know,
this whole VP thing.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.150
I didn't ask for it.

17:13.183 --> 17:14.618
I would never...

17:14.651 --> 17:15.885
-(laughs)
-I wouldn't do that to you.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.787
It's all good.

17:17.821 --> 17:21.791
-No, really, I...
-You like Nietzsche, right?

17:21.791 --> 17:24.161
-Nietzsche.
-Nietzsche.

17:24.194 --> 17:25.662
That guy.

17:25.695 --> 17:28.398
Of course you would like
that motherfucker.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.467
He was all about power and will.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.336
(sniffs)

17:32.369 --> 17:34.804
Come here.

17:34.838 --> 17:37.641
So, what you need to do now

17:37.641 --> 17:39.676
is...

17:39.709 --> 17:42.146
take that power
that you crave, EZ.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.750
Take that shit with
your bare fucking hands.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.018
Then...

17:49.052 --> 17:52.189
find the will,

17:52.222 --> 17:54.691
shove it right up
your fucking ass. (laughing)

17:56.826 --> 17:59.329
-(laughing)
-See? She gets it.

18:00.864 --> 18:03.200
Okay, where were we?
Where were we?

18:03.233 --> 18:04.234
(sighs)

18:08.205 --> 18:09.873
Anything else?

18:11.541 --> 18:13.677
-Ooh!
-Hey, what're you doing?

18:13.710 --> 18:15.879
You better respect your VP.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.017
Hey.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.022
Educate your ex-president.

18:27.524 --> 18:29.259
Fuck away from me.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.962
-(spits)
-(door opens)

18:33.029 --> 18:34.063
(door slams shut)

18:44.541 --> 18:46.543
*

19:01.558 --> 19:03.560
(panting)

19:06.062 --> 19:07.597
Mm.

19:07.631 --> 19:08.732
(sighs)

20:44.994 --> 20:46.996
-(door bells jingle)
-(water running)

20:46.996 --> 20:48.332
(music playing quietly)

20:48.365 --> 20:50.367
FELIPE:
Just a minute.

20:51.501 --> 20:54.338
-(door closes)
-(door bells jingle)

20:54.371 --> 20:58.174
* That same old fool *

20:58.207 --> 21:00.777
* Looking back at me *

21:00.844 --> 21:02.879
* And I say *

21:02.912 --> 21:05.014
* Hello, fool *

21:05.014 --> 21:06.850
* Are you *

21:06.850 --> 21:09.519
* You still my love *

21:09.519 --> 21:11.254
* Don't you? *

21:14.257 --> 21:16.225
(song ends)

21:16.259 --> 21:18.261
("The First Million Tears"
by Al Hazan starts playing)

21:20.864 --> 21:22.466
(door closes)

21:22.532 --> 21:25.301
* They say the first *

21:25.369 --> 21:27.404
* Million tears *

21:27.437 --> 21:31.240
* Are the hardest to cry *

21:31.274 --> 21:33.242
* And after *

21:33.276 --> 21:35.379
* A million *

21:35.379 --> 21:37.647
* Your tears
will start to dry... *

21:37.714 --> 21:38.648
(door closes)

21:38.715 --> 21:40.884
Hello?

21:40.917 --> 21:42.919
* Yes, I know *

21:42.952 --> 21:46.556
* I got a long way to go *

21:46.590 --> 21:48.725
* Before all my... *

21:48.758 --> 21:51.561
(motorcycle revs outside)

21:51.561 --> 21:53.563
(motorcycle drives away)

21:53.563 --> 21:56.733
* Because the first
million tears *

21:56.766 --> 21:59.403
* Are the hardest *

21:59.436 --> 22:01.237
* To cry *

22:01.270 --> 22:03.407
* And I've just begun... *

22:03.440 --> 22:06.075
(sighs)

22:07.076 --> 22:08.612
I used my hand
to prevent the branch

22:08.645 --> 22:10.246
from going into my head.

22:11.247 --> 22:13.583
Bike went one way,
I went the other, and

22:13.617 --> 22:15.251
brothers went to go get my mom.

22:15.284 --> 22:16.786
Thought I was gonna bleed out,

22:16.820 --> 22:19.122
fucking die in a field
somewhere.

22:19.155 --> 22:21.257
I always wanted
to be a ballerina.

22:21.290 --> 22:24.127
(laughs) Yeah.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.464
I always loved that,
you know, girly shit.

22:29.599 --> 22:32.436
I got two older brothers
instead, but, uh, you know.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.611
What about you?

22:46.349 --> 22:49.453
I got this.

22:49.453 --> 22:53.222
And, uh, one on my shoulder.

22:53.289 --> 22:55.959
One through the bicep.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.127
I got... (chuckles)
I got them scattered

22:58.127 --> 23:00.464
all over my-my stomach.

23:02.331 --> 23:04.300
Jesus.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.669
I've been shot eight times.

23:05.702 --> 23:08.638
No, Jesus.... those abs.

23:08.672 --> 23:11.074
I mean, dude, sit down,
finish your sandwich.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.309
You look like you're starving.
(chuckles)

23:19.516 --> 23:22.351
-I meant do you have any
brothers or sisters?
-Yeah.

23:22.385 --> 23:25.254
I'm the oldest of three.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.491
I got a...

23:27.491 --> 23:29.993
got a little brother
and a wild-ass sister.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.496
(chuckles)

23:32.496 --> 23:33.697
Different dads,

23:33.730 --> 23:36.432
but we were close.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.502
My mom, she was always working.

23:40.837 --> 23:42.539
So I looked out for them.

23:42.572 --> 23:44.040
Yeah.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.176
I was the baby,

23:47.210 --> 23:48.845
so...

23:48.845 --> 23:52.215
um... I don't know,
my brothers were more like...

23:52.248 --> 23:54.083
terrorists than siblings.

23:56.085 --> 23:58.187
That would've been nice,

23:58.221 --> 24:01.024
having somebody
look out for me, you know?

24:03.893 --> 24:05.762
I mean, it's not too late.

24:10.066 --> 24:12.401
(laughing) Dude...

24:12.435 --> 24:14.237
(laughs) I mean,
I'm sorry, what?

24:14.270 --> 24:16.372
Like...

24:16.405 --> 24:18.542
Shit.

24:18.542 --> 24:21.144
-Was that too much? Fu...
-You know,

24:21.210 --> 24:23.547
-"A" for effort.
-(groans)

24:23.547 --> 24:26.415
Execution was, like...

24:26.449 --> 24:29.085
It was a little clumsy. (laughs)

24:29.118 --> 24:31.054
You make me nervous.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.656
Me?

24:32.722 --> 24:34.257
You've been shot,
like, 30 times.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.726
I'm just some damaged chick
eating a sandwich.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.629
That sounds
a million times deadlier.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.736
Okay. "A" for execution on that.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.305
-(laughs)
-(chuckles)

24:52.475 --> 24:54.343

(children shouting in distance)

25:19.636 --> 25:21.638
(dog barking)

25:24.307 --> 25:26.943
Is it possible you've gotten
even uglier?

25:28.177 --> 25:29.779
It's the syphilis
your mom gave me.

25:29.813 --> 25:31.981
She's got me looking like
the Elephant Man.

25:32.015 --> 25:33.116
(laughs)

25:33.149 --> 25:34.651
Ah!

25:34.684 --> 25:36.219
Aw, thanks for making it.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.788
Aw, Rae and Jacob are gonna be
so happy to see you.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.056
Everyone's already out back.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.791
Here.

25:44.861 --> 25:46.796
Tell me you didn't get
my kid a dildo.

25:46.830 --> 25:48.397
(laughs) Shit, no.

25:48.464 --> 25:50.466
The dildo's for you.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.469
(dance music playing)

25:55.038 --> 25:58.141
"And then my wife and I decided
to have my testicles removed.

25:58.141 --> 26:00.476
Now I live life
with my penis inside a cage."

(laughter)

26:01.811 --> 26:04.347
"Oh, it's made life
so much more convenient.

I just call

26:06.182 --> 26:08.151
our bull, Leroy."

LAURIE:
Oh, shit, here comes
the captain.

26:13.556 --> 26:16.325
Jesus, did we have one
that I don't remember having?

26:16.325 --> 26:19.028
(scoffs) She's Kevin
and Maura's.

26:19.062 --> 26:21.597
Yeah, you'd know that
if you made half an effort

26:21.665 --> 26:23.366
with the neighbors
instead of just

26:23.399 --> 26:26.369
doing your tired
Mystery Science Theater thing.

26:26.402 --> 26:29.105
-It's pretty entertaining to me.
-RAE: Don't-don't encourage him.

26:29.172 --> 26:31.374
-Dad! Come play at the pool.
-What's up, birthday boy?

26:31.407 --> 26:32.876
First, you got to say hi
to your Uncle Gilbert.

26:32.909 --> 26:34.177
-Hey.
-GILLY: Hey.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.946
Hey, you were half that size
last I seen you.

26:37.013 --> 26:39.515
So, about Jenks' height then.

26:39.515 --> 26:40.784
All right, shark attack time.

26:40.850 --> 26:42.518
Let's go. Does Mom want to join?

26:42.551 --> 26:44.520
I'm good, thanks.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.723
You boys go get out
all that testosterone.

26:49.225 --> 26:50.526
Let's go, birthday boy.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.028
-(Paul shouts)
-Okay, kids,

26:52.061 --> 26:54.463
what are we drinking? (sighs)

26:54.530 --> 26:57.233
-Just beer for me.
-(laughs)

26:57.266 --> 26:59.035
Pussy.

26:59.035 --> 27:01.137
-(laughter)
-We got tequila inside
if anyone's interested.

27:01.204 --> 27:02.538
Fuck yeah. I'll get it.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.041
Uh, shot glasses
are over the sink.

27:05.074 --> 27:06.710
I'll give you a hand with that,

27:06.710 --> 27:07.977
seeing as you don't have any.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.645
LAURIE:
Better hope they have a stool

27:09.713 --> 27:11.314
-so you can reach the cups.
-(laughs) Shut up.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.382
See what you've been missing?

27:13.416 --> 27:15.118
Nothing changes, huh?

27:16.886 --> 27:18.587
Yes.

27:18.621 --> 27:20.323
Let's not let so much time
go by again.

27:20.389 --> 27:23.059
-Yeah.
-We miss you.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.894
You know...

27:27.396 --> 27:28.597
You good?

27:32.736 --> 27:35.138
You wouldn't lie to
a senior officer, would you?

27:38.808 --> 27:40.609
(sighs)

27:40.643 --> 27:42.578
You know, uh...

27:44.080 --> 27:45.581
Life?

27:47.250 --> 27:49.085
Yeah.

27:49.118 --> 27:51.921
It's a bitch, and then you die.

27:51.921 --> 27:54.090
Amen.

27:55.091 --> 27:57.093
(man speaking Spanish on TV)

28:05.101 --> 28:08.704
We can't apologize enough
for what happened.

28:08.772 --> 28:11.440
But, given the circumstances...

28:18.447 --> 28:20.817
We'll do what it takes
to make it up to you.

28:20.850 --> 28:23.119
Run double load
till you're whole.

28:26.022 --> 28:28.157
Hey, we got a good thing here.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.830
Be-Because of that,
we want this...

28:35.331 --> 28:37.466
-(gunshot)
-(glass shatters)

29:03.026 --> 29:04.327
(door closes)

29:05.694 --> 29:07.696
(bell tolling)

29:12.235 --> 29:13.502
(speaking Spanish)

29:26.850 --> 29:29.385
(tires screech)

29:29.418 --> 29:30.753
(gunshots)

29:35.358 --> 29:37.360
(gunfire)

29:44.233 --> 29:45.701
(grunts)

29:49.405 --> 29:51.908
-(horn honks)
-(gunfire)

29:53.910 --> 29:56.445
(horn honking)

30:17.100 --> 30:18.767
(grunts)

30:30.479 --> 30:32.481
(gunshots)

30:48.597 --> 30:50.133
(gate unlocks)

31:04.948 --> 31:06.315
TOMÁS:
Papá.

32:22.191 --> 32:23.526
¡Vámonos!

32:24.527 --> 32:26.362
(engine starts)

32:32.701 --> 32:34.870
(vehicles drive away)

32:42.045 --> 32:43.946
(door opens)

32:45.114 --> 32:46.382
(door closes)

32:48.884 --> 32:50.953
What're you doing out here?

32:53.056 --> 32:54.290
(grunts)

32:56.225 --> 32:58.161
(coughs)

32:58.227 --> 33:00.496
Shit's sad in there, man.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.065
Can't stand that new chick

33:02.065 --> 33:04.567
trying to get knuckles deep
in Bishop's prostate exam.

33:04.567 --> 33:07.236
(laughs) Oh, bro.

33:07.270 --> 33:09.238
(grunts)

33:09.238 --> 33:10.406
So, you want to kick it?

33:12.575 --> 33:14.410
Got some studying to do.

33:14.410 --> 33:17.413
(laughs) You fucking nerd.

33:17.413 --> 33:19.014
Shouldn't you be home

33:19.082 --> 33:20.583
helping your fiancée
get ready for the kid?

33:20.616 --> 33:23.986
(scoffs) She got that shit
on lock.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.159
Angel.

33:31.460 --> 33:34.097
If I ain't there,
I can't fuck it up.

33:42.505 --> 33:44.207
Well, I think

33:44.273 --> 33:45.974
not being there

33:46.008 --> 33:48.144
is the number-one way
to fuck it up.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.614
Bro, Nails isn't going anywhere.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.452
For some crazy reason,

33:56.485 --> 33:59.122
I think she may
actually like you.

34:01.157 --> 34:02.291
Imagine that.

34:03.492 --> 34:06.695
-I can't.
-(laughs) Shut the fuck up.

34:09.165 --> 34:10.799
(sighs)

34:13.802 --> 34:15.171
Go home.

34:22.378 --> 34:23.979
Yeah.

34:27.015 --> 34:29.218
RAE:
You ain't Irish, Lopez.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.021
Just didn't want
to make it a big thing.

34:33.055 --> 34:34.823
(chuckles)

34:34.823 --> 34:37.826
You sneaking out after us
not seeing you for so long

34:37.826 --> 34:40.263
would've been
a much bigger thing than

34:40.329 --> 34:41.397
you just saying goodbye.

34:43.065 --> 34:44.167
Let me help you with that.

34:44.167 --> 34:45.868
Hey.

34:47.203 --> 34:49.772
-For real, Ranger.
-(chuckles)

34:49.838 --> 34:51.340
RAE:
How you doing?

34:51.374 --> 34:53.376
I haven't been called that
in forever.

34:53.409 --> 34:55.511
(chuckles) Oh.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.380
What, you got some

34:57.413 --> 34:59.882
cool motorcycle name
now, like...

34:59.915 --> 35:02.518
Hatchet or Grizzly?

35:02.518 --> 35:04.520
(laughs)

35:04.520 --> 35:06.555
Grizzly...

35:06.589 --> 35:10.025
Seriously,
what do they call you?

35:10.058 --> 35:11.059
Gilly.

35:11.093 --> 35:13.095
(both laughing)

35:15.531 --> 35:18.201
You... you should've gone
with Hatchet.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.740
This everything
you thought it'd be?

35:24.773 --> 35:27.042
(water splashing)

35:27.042 --> 35:30.045
(muffled laughter
and conversation outside)

35:30.078 --> 35:32.548
Closest thing
I could find stateside.

35:40.289 --> 35:42.391
I was surprised
when you didn't re-up.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.061
Always imagined you a lifer.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.571
What happened in

35:55.571 --> 35:57.740
Mosul...

35:57.773 --> 35:59.942
You didn't do that.

36:02.745 --> 36:04.747
That wasn't you.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.285
That wasn't any of us.

36:15.458 --> 36:18.294
(sniffles, clears throat)

36:18.327 --> 36:20.763
-(distant scream)
-Shit.

36:20.763 --> 36:22.097
-PAUL: Fuck you!
-Calm down.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.367
-PAUL: I live here.
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

36:24.433 --> 36:25.701
Say it again, motherfucker.

36:25.768 --> 36:27.102
GILLY:
Don't look at him.

36:27.135 --> 36:28.604
What the fuck did you say to me?

36:28.637 --> 36:30.539
Fuck you and fuck
your wife, too.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.941
-Who the fuck are you?
-Don't look at him, look at me.

36:32.975 --> 36:36.044
-He's telling me to calm down.
-Yeah.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.146
Am I not fucking calm?

36:38.180 --> 36:40.883
Am I not the calmest
motherfucker here right now?

36:40.949 --> 36:42.451
Calmest motherfucker I know.

36:42.451 --> 36:43.719
-RAE: What happened?
-KEVIN: I asked him to not be

36:43.786 --> 36:44.953
so rough with the kids.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.889
He's making
everyone uncomfortable.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.292
(hushed chatter)

36:56.532 --> 36:58.301
MAN (quietly):
Honey, don't worry about it.

36:59.468 --> 37:01.136
Sorry, little man.

37:02.371 --> 37:03.572
I'm sorry.

37:03.639 --> 37:05.808
GILLY:
We're all good, bro.

37:05.841 --> 37:08.344
We're all good.

37:08.377 --> 37:10.145
No, this smug motherfucker,

37:10.145 --> 37:11.980
made me look like an asshole
in front of my kid.

37:12.014 --> 37:14.016
-Fuck you!
-You did that all
by yourself, Paul.

37:14.049 --> 37:16.151
Ignore that piece of shit. Okay?

37:16.151 --> 37:18.020
He's wearing fucking
Jesus sandals.

37:18.053 --> 37:19.254
You really want
to fuck up a dude

37:19.322 --> 37:20.823
wearing fucking Birkenstocks?

37:22.891 --> 37:24.660
Right? (laughs)

37:26.662 --> 37:29.164
-I missed you.
-I missed you, Paul.

37:29.164 --> 37:30.666
-You good?
-Mm-hmm.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.000
Yeah?

37:32.000 --> 37:33.702
Okay.

37:35.704 --> 37:37.540
I'm good, man.

37:39.575 --> 37:42.578
Hey, guy, listen,
no hard feelings?

37:49.184 --> 37:51.854
Sure thing, guy.

37:51.854 --> 37:53.856
(snoring)

37:53.856 --> 37:55.858
(hip-hop music playing faintly)

38:04.400 --> 38:06.234
You tapping out on me, old man?

38:08.904 --> 38:10.573
Fuck no.

38:10.606 --> 38:12.875
You ready for round two?

38:12.875 --> 38:14.877
(Bishop scoffs)

38:14.877 --> 38:16.311
BISHOP:
Fuck yeah.

38:16.379 --> 38:18.881
-TREENIE: Mm-hmm? Oh, shit.
-(both laugh)

38:18.914 --> 38:21.584
-Line it up.
-Mm.

38:21.617 --> 38:23.619
*

38:38.233 --> 38:41.069
-Tell me when.
-BISHOP: When.

38:41.103 --> 38:43.606
Damn.

38:43.639 --> 38:46.108
-That's big.
-(both laugh)

38:48.411 --> 38:50.413
(Muzak playing)

38:59.922 --> 39:01.924
(insects trilling)

39:07.630 --> 39:09.632
(siren wailing in distance)

39:28.517 --> 39:31.487
(insects trilling)

39:31.520 --> 39:33.656
-(grunts)
-NAILS: Hey.

39:33.689 --> 39:34.957
ANGEL:
Hey.

39:34.957 --> 39:37.325
(whispering):
Your dad's here.

39:39.327 --> 39:40.829
(whispers):
Okay. Is it a secret?

39:40.863 --> 39:42.498
Uh, he brought a cake.

39:43.632 --> 39:45.968
Yeah, exactly.

39:46.001 --> 39:48.336
(sighs)

39:48.370 --> 39:49.638
(chuckles)

39:53.976 --> 39:55.310
You're home.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.981
Hey, Pop.
(clears throat)

40:03.652 --> 40:05.654
Okay.
(chuckles)

40:11.994 --> 40:14.663
I'll leave you guys to it.

40:14.697 --> 40:16.331
You don't want some cake?

40:18.000 --> 40:19.702
Well, I'm pretty tired,
actually,

40:19.735 --> 40:21.504
on accounts on I'm...

40:21.537 --> 40:25.007
growing a person in my body.

40:26.241 --> 40:28.376
Okay. Uh...

40:28.410 --> 40:30.846
All right.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.381
You didn't tell him
to take off his shoes?

40:33.415 --> 40:34.850
Funny.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.586
(Nails laughs)

40:39.588 --> 40:41.023
You got a knife?

40:42.525 --> 40:44.192
Uh, yeah.

41:01.109 --> 41:03.111
(clinking softly)

41:24.066 --> 41:25.634
This is good.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.782
Mmm.

41:40.783 --> 41:42.585
(moaning, grunting)

41:42.618 --> 41:46.254
* But Jesus ain't coming *

41:46.254 --> 41:51.259
* So don't waste your time *

41:51.293 --> 41:55.130
* Not yours and not mine *

41:55.163 --> 41:57.933
* You're only dreaming *

42:01.136 --> 42:06.208
* And while you were scheming *

42:06.274 --> 42:10.779
* Of silver machines *

42:10.779 --> 42:15.450
* Far above the leaves *

42:15.483 --> 42:20.288
* I snuck into your scene... *

42:20.322 --> 42:22.891
Fuck, Bish.

42:22.958 --> 42:25.794
* Lurking, behind... *

42:25.794 --> 42:27.730
(TV beeps)

42:27.796 --> 42:30.132
What channel is it on?

42:30.132 --> 42:32.668
You have to change it
to Apple TV.

42:32.701 --> 42:34.703
-Then why in the fuck
do I need a...
-Hey.

42:36.204 --> 42:38.240
(sighs)

42:38.306 --> 42:41.009
Why can't we just watch
a movie in the VCR?

42:41.043 --> 42:43.011
What's a VCR?

42:43.045 --> 42:45.080
(scoffs)

42:45.147 --> 42:47.315
You're killing me, Tess.

42:47.349 --> 42:49.818
I'm inviting Obispo
for dinner next week.

42:51.820 --> 42:53.555
You didn't think to talk to me
about it first?

42:55.057 --> 42:56.859
I didn't realize
I need permission

42:56.892 --> 43:00.228
to invite people to dinner
in my own house. Hmm?

43:03.498 --> 43:05.500
I know not to touch that.

43:08.536 --> 43:11.707
You both are too stubborn.

43:11.740 --> 43:14.376
He's in a lot of pain.

43:14.409 --> 43:17.345
Come on, Dad.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.014
Yeah, I'm gonna
get it right now.

43:20.382 --> 43:22.350
You remember Maggie,
from church?

43:22.350 --> 43:23.952
ALVAREZ:
Oh, don't do that, Iz.

43:24.019 --> 43:26.789
-What?
-I know how you work.

43:26.855 --> 43:28.190
-Just leave it alone.
-(scoffs)

43:28.223 --> 43:30.258
You're crazy.

43:31.359 --> 43:33.195
(doorbell rings)

43:34.229 --> 43:35.397
Go get that.

43:35.430 --> 43:37.432
And give me that remote.

43:42.738 --> 43:46.441
Okay, so, what
are we watching, huh?

43:48.576 --> 43:51.313
-EZ.
-Padrino.

43:51.379 --> 43:54.883
Sorry to bother you like this.
Can you talk?

43:58.286 --> 43:59.554
Out here.

44:06.962 --> 44:09.064
What is it?

44:09.064 --> 44:11.566
Tired of small men
hijacking this club.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.636
Letting their ego,
their weakness dictate.

44:16.638 --> 44:18.741
Canche and fucking Bishop.

44:18.774 --> 44:20.909
They almost destroyed
everything that you built.

44:20.943 --> 44:23.111
Everything the rest of us
believe in.

44:23.145 --> 44:25.413
And we didn't even have the
power to stop it from happening.

44:26.481 --> 44:28.116
Where you going with this?

44:28.150 --> 44:30.685
I read your original bylaws.

44:30.753 --> 44:33.088
You have something in there
called a kill-switch clause.

44:33.121 --> 44:35.590
Yeah, any president
can be overruled or removed

44:35.623 --> 44:37.259
if a chapter votes
unanimously...

44:37.259 --> 44:39.427
-Votes unanimously against them.
-Right.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.429
You're always talking to me
about brotherhood.

44:41.463 --> 44:44.699
Why not give the power
back to the brothers?

44:44.767 --> 44:47.535
Reinstate the kill-switch?

44:47.602 --> 44:49.437
It could prevent what happened
between Canche and Bishop

44:49.471 --> 44:52.274
from ever happening again.

44:52.307 --> 44:55.277
If we learn from our past
like you said...

44:57.279 --> 44:59.281
...well, we can protect
our future.

45:05.687 --> 45:08.123
* You ain't seen nothing yet *

45:08.156 --> 45:10.959
* Here's something that
you're never gonna forget *

45:12.527 --> 45:15.463
* B-Baby, you just ain't
seen n-nothing yet *

45:33.048 --> 45:35.150
* And now I'm feeling better *

45:37.319 --> 45:40.823
* 'Cause I found out
for sure... *

45:40.823 --> 45:42.224
(music stops)

45:55.838 --> 45:59.174
I've buried a lot of brothers
over the years.

45:59.174 --> 46:02.878
And now we're asking
for a lot more of them to die.

46:05.747 --> 46:08.550
Montez was our brother.

46:08.583 --> 46:11.019
And they buried him
in a fucking barrel.

46:13.856 --> 46:17.692
We're not gonna get
another shot like this.

46:17.692 --> 46:20.228
Those spics are gonna be
distracted with their fucking

46:20.262 --> 46:22.898
Fallen Brothers
"Day of the Dead" bullshit.

46:25.433 --> 46:27.870
What did Chibs say?

46:29.104 --> 46:30.939
He gave the green light.

46:34.209 --> 46:35.743
You got your war.

46:35.777 --> 46:37.779

46:40.415 --> 46:42.417
(car door closes)

46:45.620 --> 46:47.622
-(radio playing)
-(engine starts)

46:50.458 --> 46:51.894
* So I took what I could get *

46:51.894 --> 46:55.230
-* Ooh, ooh *
-(engine recedes)

46:55.230 --> 46:58.433
* She looked at me
with her big brown eyes *

46:58.466 --> 47:01.569
* And said, "You ain't seen
nothing yet" *

47:01.569 --> 47:05.840
* B-Baby, you just ain't
seen nothing yet *

47:05.908 --> 47:09.912
* Here's something that you're
never gonna forget *

47:09.912 --> 47:13.281
* B-Baby, you just ain't
seen n-nothing yet *

47:13.315 --> 47:15.283
* You need an education *

47:15.317 --> 47:18.586
* Got to go to school *

47:18.586 --> 47:20.755
* That's what she told me *

47:22.757 --> 47:24.759
* No, you ain't
seen nothing yet *

47:24.792 --> 47:26.861
* Whoa, whoa *

47:26.929 --> 47:28.763
* You ain't seen nothing yet *

47:28.763 --> 47:31.799
* Sha, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la *

47:33.801 --> 47:37.705
* B-Baby, you just
ain't seen nothing yet *

47:37.772 --> 47:40.608
* B-Baby, you just ain't
seen nothing yet *

47:40.642 --> 47:43.111
* Whoa, whoa. *
