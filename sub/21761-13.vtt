but look at that booty.

a king that knew the who and how,

in these all day by a warm fire.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.241

05:24.324 --> 05:26.493

when I was a little boy...

Yes. Why-- Yes.

06:31.390 --> 06:32.934
Part of my writing process.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.103
If you were a writer, you'd know this.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.689
Actually, I do dabble in the odd bit of--

06:37.772 --> 06:39.691
[shouting] Oh, this is impossible.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.944
How am I supposed to work
with all these distractions?

06:43.028 --> 06:45.155
Now, I need to start over

06:45.239 --> 06:47.366
and get the word-juices flowing again.

First, I need to take a nap.

A few words.

-Maurice!
-What is it, Your Majesty?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.867
Words! Book!

07:30.951 --> 07:34.288
There are words in my book!

07:34.371 --> 07:35.372
And that's...

07:35.538 --> 07:38.666
Good? Bad? I'm not sure
I understand the question-- Because?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.877
[softly] I didn't write them.

07:40.961 --> 07:44.131
See? See? Right there. Words.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.217
And look at the way
they're all next to each other.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.386
Those are called sentences, Your Majesty.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.389
Sentences. Sounds fancy.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.725
What do those "sen-ten-ceezs" say?

to the illustrious career

that gave out such cold booties.

and created the sun

and bounced it up into the sky

Maurice? I'm a booty-heater. Ha, ha!

08:49.570 --> 08:51.698
King Julien, you did not create the sun.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.367
Wha-- We don't know that.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.495
I do walk in my sleep.
Could have happened then.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.247
Look, there are a bunch
more stories about me.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.249
They probably aren't real either.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.250
No, wait.

It's obvious, Mo-Mo.
What if the gods wrote this?

09:07.172 --> 09:12.260
What if the gods were all like,
"Julien-baby, J-man, love your stuff.

09:12.344 --> 09:13.761
You done so many wonderful things."

09:13.845 --> 09:15.847
And, I was like, "Who me?"

Oh, but right, you don't remember

09:20.227 --> 09:22.354
'cause of the whole sleep-walking thing.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.647
So, we wrote it all down
for you in the big book.

Enjoy. Oh, and KJ?

09:27.234 --> 09:30.904

these stories with your peeps."

09:33.156 --> 09:35.325
Yeah! That's exactly what I'm gonna do!"

09:36.159 --> 09:40.414
I got so excited when King Julien asked me
to bring his life story to the people...

09:40.497 --> 09:43.458
[chuckles] that I dug deep
into the old brain pan

09:43.542 --> 09:45.877
and looked into the future to create...

09:46.086 --> 09:48.547
the LaserInk-Jetatron.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.630
[Julien sighs]

09:49.797 --> 09:50.882
[chuckles, snorts]

09:53.718 --> 09:56.137
Finally, words have found
their true purpose.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.558
To give the joy of my greatness
to the peoples.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.395
I shall call it
The Fantastical True Stories

10:03.478 --> 10:08.400
of the Grand High King of Lemuria:
My Life and Amazing Exploits.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.402
-[giggling]
-What are you smiling about?

10:10.485 --> 10:11.778
You know this is gonna end badly.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.238
Oh, I don't know.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.406
Have you read the stories?

10:14.489 --> 10:17.617
Pretty exciting and well-written,
if you ask me.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.827
I'm interested to see
what the people think

10:19.911 --> 10:22.830
about King Julien's adventures,
I mean. Heh.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.293
Extra, extra! Read all about it.

10:26.376 --> 10:30.255
Amazing exploits of King Julien XIII.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.215
Hey, this is something.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.717
[shouting excitedly] We're all gonna read!

10:34.801 --> 10:36.428
Listen to this one.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.054
[reading] "King Julien XIII

10:38.221 --> 10:41.015
-clapped his mighty hands together...
-[wave roars]

10:41.099 --> 10:43.226
-...and scared the ocean away...
-[wave screams]

10:43.310 --> 10:45.686
...with his massive, rippling biceps."

10:45.895 --> 10:48.231
Wait. Wait, this one's too much.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.442
It's got wizards and laser eyes.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.611
[reading] "The mighty wizards
faced each other...

10:52.693 --> 10:55.655
-[both shouting]
-...eyes glowering and glowing with magic

10:55.738 --> 10:59.451
which they unleashed
in a frenetic fury of laser eyes.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.996
-[both shouting]
-But, when KJ13 used his secret weapon,

11:03.079 --> 11:04.623
his magic booty,

11:04.705 --> 11:08.001
he obliterated the evil Ratta-wiz
once and for all time."

11:08.084 --> 11:09.210
[all cheering]

11:09.461 --> 11:10.711
[Julien laughing]

11:10.837 --> 11:11.671
You see?

11:11.879 --> 11:14.549
The peoples are really loving
all the true stories

11:14.633 --> 11:16.301
the gods have written down about me.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.552
I know! [giggles]

11:17.636 --> 11:21.973
It's such a powerful feeling.
For you, Your Majesty.

11:24.225 --> 11:25.185
[Timo grunting]

11:27.479 --> 11:28.313
[Mort giggling]

11:28.480 --> 11:32.526
My peoples, we got another tale
ripped from the pages

11:32.691 --> 11:37.238
of  The Fantastical True Stories
of the Grand High King of Lemuria.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.616
If you love the Magic-Booty King Julien,

11:39.698 --> 11:42.869
you're gonna love Emo-Sparkly King Julien.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.163
[reading] "The Emo-Sparkly KJ13,

11:45.246 --> 11:47.207
brooded as he stared in

11:47.290 --> 11:50.627
a brooding-emo stare, across the beach.

11:50.709 --> 11:53.796
All sparkly and brooding and emo,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.132
and he made a mighty leaping kick.

11:56.591 --> 11:58.552
Flying brooding-emo-kick!

11:58.717 --> 12:02.639
The giant scorpion was a vile
and disgusting creature

12:02.805 --> 12:05.684
that deserved
to be kicked right in the gob."

12:06.100 --> 12:08.687
You see, this big and ugly monstrosity

12:08.769 --> 12:11.814
-lived in a cave and ate babies...
-[Mort whimpering]

12:11.981 --> 12:15.318
...and had a horrible habit
of wearing diapers on his head.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.903
Used ones!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.572
[Fred] A giant scorpion?

12:18.655 --> 12:19.906
Big and ugly?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.408
Diapers on my head?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.576
Ate babies?

12:22.741 --> 12:25.870
I only ever ate that one baby,
just the one.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.831
And now it's all
everybody ever talks about.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.584
These are lies. Lies!

12:30.667 --> 12:33.461
Everything I've believed in is a lie!

12:33.545 --> 12:35.963
King Julien is gonna pay for this!

12:36.130 --> 12:38.508
[roaring]

12:38.675 --> 12:41.261
Hi, and welcome to Xixi's Book Club.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.388
I've introduced you to some steamy

12:43.471 --> 12:45.306
finger-tinglers in the past

12:45.390 --> 12:47.892
but today we have  King Julien's

12:47.975 --> 12:52.105
Fantastical True Stories of the Grand
High King of Lemuria:

12:52.188 --> 12:54.441
My Life and Amazing Exploits.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.402
The frenzy has spawned
a hotly debated division.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.737
Who do you like better?

12:58.903 --> 13:01.072
Magic-Booty King Julien?

13:01.239 --> 13:03.324
[shouting excitedly]
Vote Team Magic-Booty!

13:03.491 --> 13:05.952
Or Emo-Sparkly King Julien?

13:06.035 --> 13:08.580
[shouting excitedly]
Vote Team Emo-Sparkly!

13:08.787 --> 13:10.540
Oh, my, so exciting.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.500
All eyes are on King Julien

13:12.584 --> 13:15.962
to see what the next installment
of his life will be.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.797
[Julien humming]

13:18.881 --> 13:20.717
Nope, still blank.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.802
How long does it take for the gods
to do their writing thing?

13:23.886 --> 13:25.764
Don't know. How'd it work last time?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.390
Well, it was pretty easy, actually.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.142
I just took a nap.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.185
Here I am, napping.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.979
Napping-nappy-nappy-nap.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.565
[snoring] Napping.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.566
Here I am.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.984
Come on. Please, gods?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.654
Please write down some more
of my amazing adventures?

13:40.861 --> 13:42.572
[softly] If you'd actually go take a nap,

13:42.656 --> 13:44.240
then I could get writing.

13:44.407 --> 13:45.241
What was that, Clover?

13:45.408 --> 13:49.370
[stuttering] I said... um, maybe
if everybody left the room,

13:49.454 --> 13:51.748
the gods could write
in  The   Kings' Chronicles.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.375
Yeah, that's what I said.
They're probably just shy.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.002
Excellent idea.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.087
Everyone out. [grunts]

13:58.379 --> 14:01.882
I'll just stay and, uh, protect
the gods while they're writing.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.510
[all] Hm?

14:06.053 --> 14:07.888
Ooh, I like that.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.141
Oh, oh! That's a good one.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.521
-Um, Clover?
-[Clover grunting]

14:14.604 --> 14:15.814
[Clover screaming]

14:15.980 --> 14:19.651
[crying] I hate it when my mommy
is mean to my dads.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.361
[Julien and Maurice grunting]

14:21.444 --> 14:24.364
[gasps] King Julien, I... Maurice!

14:24.447 --> 14:25.699
Sorry! I...

14:25.906 --> 14:27.784
[stuttering]

14:27.867 --> 14:29.202
Clover isn't here right now.

14:29.285 --> 14:33.498
Yes, you are, and Mo-Mo and I
have the bruises to prove it.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
Which really begs the question,

14:35.333 --> 14:38.878
why are you writing
in  The   Kings' Chronicles?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.087
Isn't it obvious?

14:40.839 --> 14:43.383
Clover is one of the gods?

14:43.466 --> 14:44.884
Not fair!

14:45.051 --> 14:48.179
No. Clover isn't a god, she's just Clover.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.765
And she's the one
writing the King's stories.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.726
Oh. Ooh...

14:52.809 --> 14:55.353
Uh. Wha-- [exclaims]

14:55.436 --> 14:57.564
You mean the stories about me,

14:57.647 --> 15:00.900
I can't remember happening,
actually never happened?

15:00.983 --> 15:03.528
I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I...

15:03.611 --> 15:05.029
I couldn't help myself.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.532
Oy vey... This is terrible.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.409
We can't just lie to the people.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.369
They're really believing these stories.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.495
Exactly, Maurice.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.914
These stories are important to my peoples.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.999
They are really loving my exploits.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.752
We have to give them more.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.171
Besides, I really have to hear
what I do next.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.674
"Keep on sparkling."

15:24.965 --> 15:28.762
"King Julien," smiley face.

15:28.845 --> 15:32.014
"This magic booty's for you, Dorothy."

15:33.474 --> 15:36.352
-"King Julien, hearts and sparkles--"
-[Fred] King Julien!

15:36.519 --> 15:38.271
-[all clamoring]
-[roaring]

15:38.354 --> 15:40.481
-[Clover gasps]
-Clover, you know this guy?

15:40.565 --> 15:43.276
Um. [coughs]
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I've heard of him.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.318
His name's Fred.

15:44.402 --> 15:46.362
Giant scorpion, lives in a cave.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.782
Might have kind of used him as inspiration

15:48.865 --> 15:50.700
for one of your stories.

15:50.784 --> 15:54.829
King Julien, I believed in you.
Your stories changed my life.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.415
But, then you told lies about me.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.959
Lies! And what is this place?

16:00.042 --> 16:01.502
This isn't Lemuria.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.504
This place is a total dump.

16:03.588 --> 16:07.550
And you, you're not brooding
or sparkly or muscle-y.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.761
I feel so betrayed right now.

16:09.844 --> 16:14.933
I want everyone to know
that your story about me was a lie!

16:15.141 --> 16:16.851
[laughs nervously] Sounds easy enough.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.187
Let's just tell everybody
the truth about Fred here.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.856
Hey, there now,

16:21.940 --> 16:24.191
you can't talk to KJ13 like that.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.570
He's done amazing and wondrous things.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.114
Hit him with your magic booty, King J.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.825
Uh... well... uh...

16:31.908 --> 16:33.117
Take it easy there, Ted.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.619
No! Ted's right.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.330
We don't have to be afraid of you,
you big bully.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.665
We got King Julien.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.917
He shoots magic out of his eyes

16:41.000 --> 16:42.710
and rides unicorn horns.

16:42.794 --> 16:43.795
Yes, about that...

16:43.878 --> 16:47.256
King Julien XIII is my hero.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.385
[clears throat]

16:51.469 --> 16:53.805
Listen, uh, Fred, is it?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.723
The stories are important to my peoples.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.976
They love the stories as they are

16:58.058 --> 17:00.728
and so, that's how the stories
are gonna stay.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.772
[all murmuring in agreement]

17:02.856 --> 17:05.065
That's what I'm talking about, yeah.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.567
Yeah. Sorry.

17:06.985 --> 17:11.698
Oh yeah? Well, I'm sorry, too,
because now, this is happening.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.825
[roaring] Happening!

17:13.992 --> 17:15.034
Run away!

17:15.159 --> 17:16.243
[Fred] Happening!

17:16.327 --> 17:17.453
[all shouting]

17:17.537 --> 17:18.663
This is happening!

17:21.749 --> 17:23.083
Happening!

17:23.167 --> 17:26.713
We're all gonna die
because we liked reading!

17:32.719 --> 17:35.346
This is my fault
and I'll put an end to this.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.389
On it!

17:37.932 --> 17:39.266
Back off, Fred!

17:39.475 --> 17:40.393
You want some?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.228
Come get some.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.604
[Clover grunting]

17:47.233 --> 17:49.068
Happening! This is happening!

17:55.033 --> 17:56.283
[chuckles] See?

17:56.367 --> 17:57.326
I was on it.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.661
Tail whip!

18:04.124 --> 18:06.836
So not on it.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.087
[groaning]

18:08.796 --> 18:11.298
[shouting]

18:11.966 --> 18:13.634
I don't understand.

18:13.843 --> 18:17.137
The King Julien in my stories
would never let that mean old scorpion

18:17.221 --> 18:19.139
get away with all that.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.307
Sorry, Todd,

18:20.391 --> 18:22.852
that King Julien only exists
in the beautiful,

18:22.936 --> 18:24.812
inspiring stories about me.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.188
I made it up.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.189
Huh?

18:27.314 --> 18:28.357
Uh-huh.

18:29.191 --> 18:31.986
But, my peoples deserve to know the truth.
Hey, Fred!

18:32.152 --> 18:35.698
Yeah. Hey, listen. Uh, you win, big guy.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.157
I'll tell the truth.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.827
Not only is my story about you fake,

18:39.911 --> 18:42.413
but  none  of my stories are real.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.540
Everything I said, written by Clover,

18:44.624 --> 18:46.208
was a big fat lie.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.418
They're all fake.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.087
-Uh?
-What?

18:49.253 --> 18:50.296
-Why?
-I don't--

18:50.588 --> 18:52.715
Say it ain't so, King Julien.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.634
Say it ain't so.

18:54.717 --> 18:56.886
Yes, Ted. It is so.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.597
Aw, sheesh! Life ain't worth living.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.224
I'm in the dark here. Get that?

19:02.308 --> 19:03.684
I'm in the dark!

19:04.102 --> 19:06.353
Wait, all the stories are fake?

19:06.437 --> 19:08.272
All of them? That's even worse.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.441
This book changed my life and without it,

19:10.524 --> 19:12.860
-I feel so sad. So empty.
-Oh, boy.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.780
So angry. [screaming]

19:16.572 --> 19:17.740
This is happening!

19:17.949 --> 19:19.199
Hey, whoa! Frederick.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.200
Cool it, buddy.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.328
What's with you and all the destroying?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.246
Calm it down a notch.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.332
Sorry. I got anger issues.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.500
I gotta breathe.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.918
[panting]

19:29.043 --> 19:31.587
One, two, three, four...

19:31.671 --> 19:32.672
Okay, that's better.

19:32.755 --> 19:34.423
That was bad... That was bad me.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.925
You don't want bad me.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.886
My peoples, and Fred, listen to me.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.179
Everybody take a knee.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.180
Come on in, bring it in.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.516
Uh...

19:43.599 --> 19:47.561
We all love the stories about me
for a lot of reasons.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.981
Mainly, because they were about me.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.859
Look, these stories may not be true,

19:52.942 --> 19:54.360
but that's not important.

19:54.443 --> 19:58.238
What is important
is how they made you feel.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.783
Say, King Julien's right.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.953
Listen, Fred, I know just what you need,

20:04.120 --> 20:05.245
-buddy.
-What?

20:05.329 --> 20:08.875
Our, like, totally beloved
King Julien XIII

20:08.958 --> 20:11.711
awoke to find his most royal magic

20:11.794 --> 20:15.506
emo-sparkly booty drifting through space.

20:15.589 --> 20:18.885
This is me, "My booty's all floaty."

20:19.052 --> 20:21.179
[humming] Oh, oh, oh, oh...

20:21.345 --> 20:25.016
Until he was surrounded
by the evil space gizzards

20:25.099 --> 20:27.143
in their buttleships.

20:27.226 --> 20:31.397
All their really big laser guns
pointed right at him.

20:31.480 --> 20:34.441
"Oh, no! I am so a goner.

20:34.692 --> 20:38.196
If only somebody were brave enough
to save me."

20:38.362 --> 20:40.239
But, too late. So sad.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.242
All the laser guns fired at once,
like this.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.536
[Julien imitating a laser] Pew! Pew!

20:45.619 --> 20:47.538
[Julien screaming] Pew! Pew!

20:47.621 --> 20:49.498
-[grunts in pain]
-[crowd exclaims in fear]

20:49.999 --> 20:53.794
Just then, behind him,
Fred came swooping in.

20:53.878 --> 20:55.254
Whoosh!

20:55.337 --> 20:57.006
[imitating Fred] "I am heroic Fred,

20:57.090 --> 21:00.885
-flying my giant scorpion space thingy.
-[Fred chuckling]

21:00.968 --> 21:02.636
I will help you.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.597
Together we will save the day."

21:04.680 --> 21:06.849
-And the two hero guys fought back.
-[laughing]

21:06.933 --> 21:08.935
-Oh, baby! What a fight.
-[Mort grunts]

21:09.102 --> 21:11.854
[makes fighting and gun sounds]

21:11.979 --> 21:13.355
Help me!

21:13.522 --> 21:15.024
You go, King Julien!

21:15.233 --> 21:21.114
Pew, pew! But, it looked like Fred
and KJ13 were, like, gonna be obliterated.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.698
[all gasping]

21:22.865 --> 21:26.285
Then Fred said,
"Use the booty, King Julien."

21:26.368 --> 21:28.746
[laughing] I said that?

21:28.913 --> 21:33.834
Thusly, KJ13 used his booty
and Fred used his really loud voice

21:33.918 --> 21:38.714
and together they blew up all the baddies
in a big epic finish.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.591
[makes explosion sounds]

21:41.884 --> 21:42.885
[blows raspberry]

21:43.928 --> 21:46.180
[both shout hysterically]

21:47.723 --> 21:51.227
"And those are the adventures,
of the Most Amazing Marvelous

21:51.310 --> 21:52.770
Fantastic Fred, Giant Scorpion,

21:52.853 --> 21:54.354
and friend to everyone everywhere,

21:54.438 --> 21:56.190
who only ever ate that one baby.

21:56.274 --> 21:58.859
-The end."
-[crowd cheering]

21:58.943 --> 22:01.195
Way to go, Fred!

22:01.361 --> 22:02.696
Nice work, Your Majesty.

22:02.780 --> 22:04.782
Although, I could have written it better.

22:04.949 --> 22:08.286
Mr. Marvelous Fantastic Fred,

22:08.452 --> 22:10.579
can I have your autograph?

22:10.746 --> 22:12.248
Sure there, little fella.

22:14.500 --> 22:17.044
-[heart beating]
-[stammering]

22:17.211 --> 22:18.587
-Aah!
-[all gasping]

22:18.754 --> 22:19.588
Huh?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.258
Just kidding.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.426
I wasn't gonna eat this baby.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.553
I so fooled you guys.

22:27.221 --> 22:29.223
[laughing]

22:30.474 --> 22:32.810
[laughing nervously]

22:34.645 --> 22:35.938
[Julien laughing]

22:36.022 --> 22:38.191
Fred, you are such a kidder.

22:38.274 --> 22:40.276
Quick, Clover.
Get Todd out of here.

22:41.359 --> 22:43.654
["Cake o'clock Rock" playing]
