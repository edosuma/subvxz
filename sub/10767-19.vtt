WEBVTT

00:05.333 --> 00:08.370
Now, look, Uncle Phil,
we don't need nothing too fancy...

00:08.533 --> 00:11.172
...as long as it's got
vibrating bucket seats...

00:11.333 --> 00:14.325
...a refrigerated glove compartment
and a license plate that say:

00:16.293 --> 00:19.888
Will, this car is for basic transportation,
not your indulgences.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.327
That's right, big guy.

00:21.493 --> 00:25.486
We want something that emphasizes
good sense over style and excitement.

00:25.653 --> 00:27.644
How about a '94 you?

00:29.013 --> 00:31.811
- There it is.
- Oh, okay.

00:34.413 --> 00:36.210
Ta-da!

00:36.693 --> 00:38.285
The all new Accountant BX.

00:38.453 --> 00:41.525
It has the latest technology
in childproof door locks.

00:42.613 --> 00:46.128
What are the honeys gonna say about
a dude cruising around in one of these?

00:46.293 --> 00:51.321
They'll say, " Why, there goes
a thrifty, level-headed young man."

00:51.493 --> 00:55.406
Yeah, right before they say,
"And I'll never have sex with him."

02:04.893 --> 02:07.202
Afternoon, gentlemen.

02:07.373 --> 02:10.012
- Philip Banks.
- Pete Fletcher. I'll be right with you.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.403
Thanks, I think we found
what we're looking for.

02:12.573 --> 02:14.689
Oh, good. I like a man
who knows what he wants.

02:14.853 --> 02:16.525
Makes my job a whole lot easier.

02:20.893 --> 02:23.009
Uncle Phil, you not
seriously considering...

02:23.173 --> 02:25.812
...making me drive
this Carltonmobile, are you?

02:27.093 --> 02:32.008
Son, when I was in college,
I drove a manure-brown '65 Dodge Dart.

02:32.173 --> 02:34.528
So why you taking that out on me?

02:35.733 --> 02:37.371
What a piece of junk.

02:37.533 --> 02:40.764
Tow trucks used to follow me around
like vultures.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.171
You deserve better, Uncle Phil.

02:43.933 --> 02:48.290
- Perhaps.
- Don't listen to him, Dad. It's a trick.

02:48.453 --> 02:50.603
Check this out, Uncle Phil.

02:51.573 --> 02:53.529
You like that, right?

02:59.653 --> 03:04.807
There you are, Uncle Phil,
25 years younger...

03:04.973 --> 03:07.248
...thousands of pounds thinner...

03:11.933 --> 03:14.322
...cruising the strip at Princeton.

03:15.253 --> 03:18.086
Wind blowing
through your big old fro.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.449
Honeys checking you out.

03:25.933 --> 03:27.605
They're saying:

03:27.773 --> 03:31.732
"There go Philip Banks,
he is a bad mamma jamma."

03:33.933 --> 03:37.482
They waving at you, Uncle Phil.
Go ahead, go ahead, wave back.

03:37.653 --> 03:39.883
It's okay, wave back. Go ahead.

03:40.973 --> 03:43.009
Right on, sisters.

03:45.733 --> 03:48.042
Dad, did I mention
that the all-new Accountant...

03:48.213 --> 03:50.169
...gets 75 miles to the gallon?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.893
To hell with the Accountant,
I want this.

03:55.613 --> 03:57.012
Excellent choice, Mr. Banks.

03:57.173 --> 03:59.403
Come on in the office,
we'll crunch some numbers.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.052
All right.

04:01.213 --> 04:03.329
Dad, Will just bamboozled you.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.166
And that's the story we'll tell
your mother. Thanks, Will.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.130
You bought a great car, Mr. Banks.

04:13.293 --> 04:15.443
- Thanks for your business.
- No, no, thank you.

04:15.613 --> 04:18.252
- Carlton.
- Someday.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.649
- Will.
- Oh, yes, sir?

04:21.813 --> 04:23.929
I believe this is yours.

04:24.093 --> 04:25.367
Yo, a grand?

04:25.533 --> 04:29.128
Yeah, well, that's the standard
commission for an Evader.

04:29.293 --> 04:30.806
Oh, I forgot something.

04:30.973 --> 04:32.611
What? Another zero?

04:33.533 --> 04:34.522
Hey, hey.

04:34.693 --> 04:38.242
Well, I can only pay commission
to someone who works for me.

04:38.413 --> 04:40.244
Interested?

04:41.013 --> 04:43.925
That sounds great, man.
I can't fade that, I'm still in school.

04:44.093 --> 04:46.687
Well, good for you.
Forget I mentioned it.

04:46.853 --> 04:50.050
What does a college kid need
with cash like this anyway?

04:51.813 --> 04:55.328
Hey, hey, hey.
What you talking about?

04:55.493 --> 05:00.362
Will, I believe you have the makings
of a super salesman, and together...

05:00.533 --> 05:01.966
...we can make piles of money.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.328
Of course, my pile would be bigger.

05:06.333 --> 05:08.927
- How about Saturdays?
- Saturdays?

05:09.093 --> 05:12.290
I tell you, throw a CD changer
in my uncle's Evader, you got a deal.

05:12.453 --> 05:15.331
- Done. How about Sundays?
- You gotta give me some wire wheels.

05:15.493 --> 05:18.087
- Holidays?
- Got to give a brother cellular for that.

05:20.773 --> 05:23.446
"As you become more comfortable
as a salesman...

05:23.613 --> 05:26.047
...you'll develop your own style."

05:30.373 --> 05:34.366
Say, baby, with all that butt,
you might be needing a hatchback.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.652
I'm gonna be so rich.

05:38.613 --> 05:40.683
- Hi, Will.
- Oh, hey.

05:40.853 --> 05:44.050
Hil, you mind
if I kick my sales rap on you?

05:44.213 --> 05:45.532
Pretend you're buying a car.

05:45.813 --> 05:49.362
No offense, Will, but I would never
buy a car from you.

05:51.453 --> 05:53.171
Hil, we're pretending here.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.722
You're not my cousin,
you're somebody else.

05:55.893 --> 05:58.043
Oh, I get it. Okay.

06:00.773 --> 06:02.172
Hi, I'm Will Smith.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.893
And I'm the Baroness Natasha.

06:05.533 --> 06:10.448
I am on holiday in your country with
my husband, the baron, and my lover...

06:11.453 --> 06:13.045
...Gustav.

06:17.973 --> 06:20.726
Okay, look, baroness,
I was wondering...

06:20.893 --> 06:23.327
...if I could interest you
in a sporty new Evader?

06:23.493 --> 06:26.212
- It has a V6 dual overhead...
- Yes, of course, I take six.

06:26.373 --> 06:28.603
Gustav, pay the man.

06:30.533 --> 06:33.445
You take jewels, yes?

06:35.253 --> 06:36.891
Hey, thanks a lot, Hil.

06:37.053 --> 06:38.611
My pleasure. Well, I'm off.

06:38.773 --> 06:41.003
You most certainly are.

06:43.773 --> 06:46.241
Look, G, I was wondering if my sales...

06:46.413 --> 06:47.846
Peasant!

06:52.493 --> 06:54.723
Hey, can I kick my sales rap
around with you?

06:54.893 --> 06:58.169
Later. Your Aunt Viv and I are going
for a ride in Daddy's new toy.

07:00.773 --> 07:03.162
- What is that?
- This is cruising music.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.689
Al Green and the Isley Brothers.

07:06.853 --> 07:10.163
- Sookie, sookie, now.
- Baby.

08:32.653 --> 08:34.769
- Come in.
- Hey, hey.

08:35.293 --> 08:40.128
Will, Will, Will. Man, congratulations.

08:40.293 --> 08:44.251
Five cars in one day.
I've never seen anything like it.

08:44.413 --> 08:46.608
Oh, yes, I have. Me.

08:47.853 --> 08:50.970
Look, I'm telling you, boss,
it is the best feeling in the world.

08:51.133 --> 08:54.011
Well, there's a close second.
You know what I'm talking about.

08:54.173 --> 08:55.686
You know what I'm talking about.

08:56.413 --> 08:58.369
Well, there'll be plenty
of time for that.

08:58.533 --> 09:02.287
Now, if you feel good now,
take a look at your commission check.

09:03.813 --> 09:06.247
I'm sorry, are my pants wet?

09:07.573 --> 09:11.248
How many of your friends can say they
made that kind of money in one day?

09:11.413 --> 09:13.210
What you mean, legally?

09:14.253 --> 09:15.766
But it's a shame.

09:15.933 --> 09:18.845
Tomorrow, when you're in
some chemistry class...

09:19.013 --> 09:23.564
...learning about inert gases, someone
will be stealing your commissions.

09:24.253 --> 09:26.721
- Now, that's where you're wrong.
- That's the spirit.

09:26.893 --> 09:29.885
I don't take chemistry,
but I damn sure know math.

09:30.693 --> 09:33.082
So you can figure
what a full-time check would be?

09:33.253 --> 09:35.972
Yes, sir. Five times this,
carry the six, and add a zero.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.249
- And what do you get?
- I get out of school.

09:38.413 --> 09:40.210
Shake hands with
your new full-time man.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.250
Whoomp, there it is.

09:51.733 --> 09:55.043
Isn't this great?
Family fun and no Will.

09:55.213 --> 09:58.125
- Your turn, son.
- Okay, to me.

09:58.813 --> 10:02.647
"You're in a store and you find $50
on the ground. Do you pick it up?"

10:02.813 --> 10:05.805
Of course not. Geoffrey picks it up.

10:06.693 --> 10:09.730
- Your turn, Ash.
- Oh, okay, Daddy.

10:10.653 --> 10:14.202
"It's clear your teenage daughter is
not enjoying the tedious board game...

10:14.373 --> 10:17.604
...being played in a forced
family-bonding moment.

10:17.773 --> 10:18.762
What do you do?"

10:18.933 --> 10:23.529
Fine. I try to encourage family time
together, and this is the thanks I get.

10:23.693 --> 10:25.604
If you don't wanna play,
you don't have to.

10:25.773 --> 10:28.241
- Go on, get out of here!
- Philip.

10:29.893 --> 10:31.929
That's what it says on the card.

10:37.733 --> 10:41.442
Well, I'd ask if there was
something else she'd rather do...

10:43.653 --> 10:45.325
...and discuss an alternative.

10:45.493 --> 10:48.132
- Good answer, baby.
- Oh, I bet you feel like a big dummy.

10:48.293 --> 10:51.603
Hey, hey, hey.
Yo, I tore up that sales chart today.

10:51.773 --> 10:53.172
Well, congratulations, Will.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.052
If you find something that excites you,
hold on to it.

10:56.213 --> 10:58.886
That's what gets me through the day.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.648
So, Uncle Phil,
what you're saying is that...

11:02.813 --> 11:06.522
...if a guy finds a job that he likes,
he should give it his all.

11:06.693 --> 11:08.092
Absolutely.

11:08.253 --> 11:12.246
- Then I'm doing the right thing.
- Of course you are. What are you doing?

11:12.413 --> 11:15.610
I'm thinking I'm gonna quit school
and sell cars full-time.

11:16.173 --> 11:18.687
Boy, have you lost your damn mind?

11:19.253 --> 11:22.370
There is no way you're gonna
quit school as long as I'm here.

11:23.133 --> 11:26.682
Aunt Viv, it's not like I'm working fries
in some burger joint.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.526
Look, I'm in a suit and a tie
and I'm selling fine cars.

11:29.693 --> 11:30.682
That's right.

11:30.853 --> 11:33.242
College isn't for everyone,
and if Will is happy...

11:33.413 --> 11:35.404
...I think we should
all be happy for him.

11:35.813 --> 11:38.646
That's right. Hey, thanks a lot, Ash.

11:38.813 --> 11:43.045
Listen, I get my license in a few months.
You think you could hook me up?

11:43.213 --> 11:45.249
Ashley, go to your room.

11:45.893 --> 11:47.167
- Cherry red.
- I got you.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.925
- You know.
- I got you, go ahead.

11:49.933 --> 11:52.811
Your mother sent you here
so you could have a bright future.

11:52.973 --> 11:55.009
You quit school,
you're throwing it all away.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.085
- I won't allow that.
- See, now, that's not fair.

11:58.253 --> 12:00.562
Hilary dropped out of school
and turned out great.

12:00.733 --> 12:03.611
Hilary's success is contrary
to the laws of nature.

12:03.773 --> 12:05.365
Totally inexplicable.

12:06.653 --> 12:08.644
Oh, stop.

12:11.053 --> 12:13.772
- Look, that was a bad example.
- Will, I think it's stupid...

12:13.933 --> 12:15.651
- Stupid? It's not stupid.
- Hey. Hey!

12:15.813 --> 12:18.168
Could we talk to Will
in private, please?

12:19.253 --> 12:20.481
It's idiotic.

12:21.933 --> 12:25.448
Look, Uncle Phil, you go to college
to figure out what you wanna do.

12:25.613 --> 12:28.810
I mean, I found what I wanna do,
and it ain't taking me no four years.

12:29.773 --> 12:32.082
Going to college
is not about finding a job.

12:32.253 --> 12:33.971
It's also about finding yourself.

12:34.133 --> 12:37.443
And the search should take
more than one weekend.

12:38.333 --> 12:41.723
Why can't you guys respect my
decisions and treat me like an adult?

12:42.213 --> 12:45.444
Okay, fine. I'm telling your mother.

12:45.613 --> 12:47.331
Oh, Aunt Viv.

12:50.693 --> 12:54.049
Look, Uncle Phil,
I got to do this, man.

12:56.733 --> 12:59.008
All right, Will.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.249
Hey, come on, man,
it's not the end of the world.

13:03.413 --> 13:04.687
Yes, it is.

13:05.093 --> 13:08.802
If I'd waited a few days, I could have
bought that car from you wholesale.

13:13.613 --> 13:15.763
- Yo, what up, J?
- Yo.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.329
I need to ask you a favor.

13:19.493 --> 13:21.688
I need a car with a back seat.

13:23.973 --> 13:26.851
Jazz, I can't just give you a car
to take off the lot, man.

13:27.053 --> 13:29.123
Who said anything
about leaving the lot?

13:31.733 --> 13:33.803
This will do just fine.

13:34.493 --> 13:36.643
Get out. Get out!

13:36.813 --> 13:38.246
Come on, Ophelia.

13:39.453 --> 13:43.366
That's all right,
I have a real friend at the bus depot.

13:46.773 --> 13:48.809
Well, this is impressive, man.

13:48.973 --> 13:51.646
Twelve units in your first week.

13:51.813 --> 13:55.601
You realize I have people on my staff
who don't sell 12 cars in a year?

13:55.813 --> 13:58.043
Well, they in the wrong business.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.647
So you think I should fire Harrison,
do you?

14:02.333 --> 14:04.893
- I didn't say that.
- Well, you're wrong.

14:05.853 --> 14:08.242
- Good.
- You should fire him.

14:09.013 --> 14:10.651
- What? Me?
- Yes.

14:10.813 --> 14:13.327
Because I think you're
excellent management material.

14:13.493 --> 14:15.529
Here, sit down.

14:16.293 --> 14:18.249
Put your feet up.

14:18.413 --> 14:21.405
Good. See? Looks good on you.

14:21.573 --> 14:24.883
Yeah. Feels nice on my butt too.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.651
Imported cigar?

14:27.813 --> 14:29.883
- Lf that's all you got.
- Yeah.

14:30.573 --> 14:32.165
Bite the end off.

14:39.013 --> 14:41.083
I'm not too sure
about this firing thing, man.

14:41.253 --> 14:45.132
Will, Harrison's been
sliding downhill for years.

14:45.293 --> 14:47.329
His sales record is embarrassing.

14:47.493 --> 14:49.563
Especially when compared
to a mover like you.

14:49.733 --> 14:53.931
Go ahead, put him out of his misery.
It's the only humane thing to do.

14:56.413 --> 14:59.211
This chair is made out
of leather, isn't it?

15:00.613 --> 15:02.524
All right, all right.

15:16.493 --> 15:19.132
Say, Harrison, you got a second, man?

15:19.293 --> 15:21.443
Sure, I'm just doing some paperwork.

15:21.613 --> 15:25.128
You know, some nights I can barely
tear myself away from this desk.

15:25.973 --> 15:27.929
Maybe you can take it with you.

15:28.653 --> 15:31.565
- Look, Harrison...
- Don't get me wrong.

15:31.773 --> 15:34.333
Did you know I have six kids?

15:35.253 --> 15:37.244
No, I didn't know that. Hey.

15:37.693 --> 15:41.208
You know, I bet you'd love to spend
more time with them, wouldn't you?

15:41.373 --> 15:45.002
Sure, especially since Mary died.

15:47.453 --> 15:49.250
I'll be right back.

15:53.693 --> 15:57.766
Yo, man, did you know Harrison
has six kids and a dead wife?

15:57.933 --> 15:59.252
Of course I know.

15:59.413 --> 16:01.131
He's my brother.

16:02.093 --> 16:05.642
- See, now, that's cold, man.
- No, Will, that's business.

16:05.813 --> 16:10.125
When you're the manager,
you make the tough decisions.

16:10.293 --> 16:12.853
I don't know, man.
Firing people ain't fun.

16:13.053 --> 16:15.089
It's an acquired taste. You'll learn it.

16:15.253 --> 16:16.766
I have faith in you.

16:17.733 --> 16:19.246
I don't know, man.

16:19.413 --> 16:22.849
That's it, you're out of here, come on.
Don't be eyeballing me neither.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.332
Get on, come on.

16:24.533 --> 16:25.761
Get on!

16:25.933 --> 16:28.288
And wash those shirts.
Especially you.

16:30.653 --> 16:32.723
That's three less mechanics
to worry about.

16:32.893 --> 16:35.453
Great. Tomorrow,
we hit the parts department.

16:35.613 --> 16:37.092
- Yes, sir.
- I'll buy you a steak.

16:37.253 --> 16:38.971
All right.

16:39.133 --> 16:42.603
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, man, you missed a spot.

16:42.773 --> 16:44.047
You're fired!

16:49.253 --> 16:50.845
Fired!

16:52.653 --> 16:56.726
Now, look, the bottom line is,
he wasn't producing.

16:56.893 --> 16:59.566
Now, in this business,
you either cut it or you don't.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.132
And he didn't.

17:01.293 --> 17:03.409
So y'all can take
your bellyaching elsewhere...

17:03.573 --> 17:05.803
...because it's falling on deaf ears.

17:08.133 --> 17:10.727
Get on out of here
before I have to take my belt off.

17:12.893 --> 17:14.246
Yo!

17:14.413 --> 17:17.132
Oh, that's funny?
Y'all think that's funny?

17:17.292 --> 17:20.490
What were my nieces
and nephews doing here?

17:20.653 --> 17:23.849
Yeah, they were coming to plead
your brother Harrison's job.

17:24.012 --> 17:27.323
I guess none of them
good salesmen either, huh?

17:27.853 --> 17:31.050
You're beginning to scare me.
Can I adopt you?

17:34.373 --> 17:39.242
Hey, Pete, do you remember
November 6, 1987?

17:39.413 --> 17:40.448
How can I forget?

17:40.613 --> 17:45.084
That's the day I set the sales record
for the entire Southern California area.

17:45.253 --> 17:46.572
I sold 11 cars.

17:47.213 --> 17:49.727
Well, 10. One of them
had an exploding gas tank.

17:50.733 --> 17:54.646
As far as I'm concerned, once
they leave the showroom, it's a sale.

17:54.853 --> 17:57.925
Well, that don't matter,
because today I'm gonna sell 15.

17:58.093 --> 17:59.731
Nobody can sell 15 cars.

17:59.893 --> 18:02.771
- Will Smith can sell 15 cars.
- Oh, yeah?

18:02.933 --> 18:06.642
Why don't you try your hand
at that angry sister that just came in.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.727
Yo, man, that's my mom.

18:10.893 --> 18:13.202
So what? A sale's a sale.

18:13.733 --> 18:16.531
Hey, Ma.

18:16.693 --> 18:20.845
Boy, where do you get off
dropping out of school?

18:21.053 --> 18:24.489
- Mrs. Smith, if I may interject...
- Who the hell are you?

18:25.533 --> 18:29.048
Mom, this is my boss.
This is Mr. Fletcher.

18:29.973 --> 18:33.249
So you're the snake
that lured my boy...

18:33.413 --> 18:36.689
...from that fine institute
of higher learning.

18:36.853 --> 18:39.686
Mrs. Smith, your son has
a bright and productive future...

18:39.853 --> 18:41.366
...here at Mulholland Motors.

18:41.533 --> 18:45.492
Oh, really?
You ever been beat up by a woman?

18:46.773 --> 18:49.207
Not without having paid for it.

18:52.533 --> 18:57.288
Will, I'll be in my office hiding
under the desk if you need me.

18:57.853 --> 18:59.206
Now, Mom, listen.

18:59.373 --> 19:00.852
For the first time in my life...

19:01.013 --> 19:03.766
...I found something
that I'm good at and that I enjoy.

19:03.933 --> 19:06.572
- It feels good, Mom.
- Oh, yeah?

19:06.733 --> 19:08.803
- Does this feel good?
- Mom.

19:08.973 --> 19:11.203
- Which way is that college?
- Mom.

19:11.373 --> 19:12.931
- Mom!
- Let's go.

19:13.093 --> 19:15.607
This doesn't feel good, Mom.

19:16.373 --> 19:18.364
My commission!

19:20.893 --> 19:22.690
This fat-free cake isn't bad.

19:22.853 --> 19:25.890
Sir, that's a sponge.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.452
Well, I guess I'll start
my homework now.

19:33.253 --> 19:34.971
I got a lot of studying to do...

19:35.133 --> 19:38.091
...if I expect to make the best
of this wonderful opportunity...

19:38.253 --> 19:40.209
...to get my college education!

19:40.373 --> 19:42.648
Will, your mother's not here.

19:42.813 --> 19:45.122
She went out to dinner
with your Aunt Viv.

19:45.293 --> 19:47.045
Oh, she better had.

19:48.733 --> 19:52.043
Will, I'm sorry we had to
involve her in this...

19:52.213 --> 19:54.443
...but you really left us no choice.

19:55.413 --> 19:57.847
How in the world did she get
the college to readmit you?

19:58.573 --> 20:01.007
She threatened to enroll herself.

20:01.853 --> 20:04.003
We're all glad you finally came
to your senses.

20:04.173 --> 20:07.404
You have plenty of time to figure out
what you wanna do with your life.

20:07.573 --> 20:11.282
And being a car salesman didn't exactly
bring out your most endearing qualities.

20:12.013 --> 20:14.481
Uncle Phil, I was getting paid, man.

20:14.653 --> 20:16.450
Will, what you do for a living...

20:16.613 --> 20:20.049
...should provide you with a sense
of pride and personal fulfillment.

20:20.213 --> 20:22.443
It should tap into that part of you...

20:22.613 --> 20:25.081
...that has something valuable
to give to the world.

20:25.253 --> 20:27.403
Shouldn't be just about money.

20:28.893 --> 20:32.010
- You really believe that, Uncle Phil?
- Yes, son, I do.

20:33.013 --> 20:35.402
Then how do you explain
being a lawyer?

20:42.293 --> 20:45.012
I'm going to get
another piece of sponge.

20:52.573 --> 20:55.133
How in the world did she get
the college to readmit you?

20:55.413 --> 20:57.802
She threatened to enroll herself.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.203
Well, we're all gla...

21:01.373 --> 21:04.012
Well, we're all glad you came
to your senses.

21:04.173 --> 21:07.563
You have plenty of time to figure out
what you wanna do with your life.

21:07.733 --> 21:12.409
And being a car salesman
didn't exactly promote your... * * * *.

21:14.013 --> 21:16.402
It didn't promote...?

21:17.333 --> 21:20.609
Excuse me. It's people from the Lord.

21:20.773 --> 21:22.764
There's people of the Lord
in the audience.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.401
Well, it ain't like they ain't never
used that word.

21:27.173 --> 21:29.004
We sorry.

21:29.533 --> 21:31.808
See... See, James Avery...

21:31.973 --> 21:33.850
See, he's a heathen.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.763
- He's just a heathen.
- Amen.

21:36.933 --> 21:38.446
He's a blasphemer.

21:38.653 --> 21:39.927
Here we go.
