WEBVTT

00:02.540 --> 00:04.180
THE DOCTOR: Listen to me,
Karvanista.

00:04.180 --> 00:06.180
If you think you have won
this little skirmish,

00:06.180 --> 00:07.420
you are very much mistaken.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.420
Do not imagine for a second

00:09.420 --> 00:11.700
that you have got the better of us.
Right, Yaz?

00:11.700 --> 00:13.100
Oh, yeah.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.780
We are totally in command.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.980
Is that right?

00:17.980 --> 00:20.180
Cos from where I'm hovering,
you seem to be handcuffed

00:20.180 --> 00:22.060
and footlocked to a gravity bar,

00:22.060 --> 00:24.660
which in 79 seconds
will release you

00:24.660 --> 00:27.700
into the boiling acid ocean
directly below, where your bodies

00:27.700 --> 00:29.340
will instantly disintegrate.

00:29.340 --> 00:32.420
Even if you survive that -
which you won't -

00:32.420 --> 00:34.820
in four minutes' time,
the entire planet will be engulfed

00:34.820 --> 00:37.700
by a nearby giant red star.

00:37.700 --> 00:41.940
Oh, and if you try and escape, my
Kill Disks will blast you to
pieces.

00:41.940 --> 00:44.140
WHIRRING

00:44.140 --> 00:47.420
Meanwhile, I am now far away,

00:47.420 --> 00:49.660
travelling towards
what will in future be known

00:49.660 --> 00:51.940
as the final hours
of planet Earth.

00:51.940 --> 00:53.740
BOTH: What?!
Don't worry.

00:53.740 --> 00:55.140
You'll be long dead.

00:55.140 --> 00:56.380
Oh!

00:56.380 --> 00:59.500
BEEPING
I must admit, Yaz,

00:59.500 --> 01:01.980
I can't help feeling that
some of this is my fault.

01:01.980 --> 01:03.420
Some?

01:03.420 --> 01:05.700
All of this is your fault!
What d'you mean?!

01:05.700 --> 01:07.740
Accidentally blowing up
Karvanista's droid guards

01:07.740 --> 01:10.340
when we were trying to sneak into
his operations base unnoticed?

01:10.340 --> 01:12.140
It's very temperamental, Nitro-9.

01:12.140 --> 01:16.060
Suggesting we escape his base
by air-surfing on this gravbar?

01:16.060 --> 01:18.220
How was I to know that force shield
would reboot

01:18.220 --> 01:20.140
at the exact moment
we were heading towards it?

01:20.140 --> 01:21.540
And when we got captured,

01:21.540 --> 01:24.380
you had to mention the two
sets of cuffs in your pocket!

01:24.380 --> 01:25.820
BEEPING

01:25.820 --> 01:27.660
Two words, Yaz,

01:27.660 --> 01:29.460
Trapezium Seven.

01:29.460 --> 01:30.700
OK.

01:30.700 --> 01:34.180
Trapezium Seven!
That high-gravity circus workshop!

01:34.180 --> 01:36.780
Who were the top two in the class?

01:36.780 --> 01:38.220
Ready? No!

01:38.220 --> 01:40.020
Me neither. I love being not ready.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.460
Three, two, one.

01:42.460 --> 01:43.660
Alley-oop!

01:45.020 --> 01:47.420
THEY GASP

01:47.420 --> 01:48.380
Got it!

01:49.380 --> 01:50.820
DISKS FIRE

01:51.820 --> 01:52.980
Time to go!

01:54.340 --> 01:57.420
THEY SCREAM

02:01.380 --> 02:03.180
How do we get these cuffs off?

02:03.180 --> 02:06.220
Very easily because, Yasmin Khan,

02:06.220 --> 02:08.060
they're voice-activated!

02:08.060 --> 02:10.900
That's why I told him
they were in my pocket!

02:10.900 --> 02:12.140
Release.

02:14.180 --> 02:16.420
Release! Release!

02:16.420 --> 02:18.420
THEY YELL

02:18.420 --> 02:20.660
Release!

02:20.660 --> 02:22.620
Oh, maybe I was Scottish
when I set them up.

02:22.620 --> 02:24.020
SCOTTISH ACCENT: Release!

02:24.020 --> 02:25.940
YELLS: Release!

02:28.180 --> 02:29.700
Doctor!

02:29.700 --> 02:31.020
THEY SHOUT

02:37.340 --> 02:39.580
Doctor! The gravbar's breaking!

02:39.580 --> 02:40.900
That's inconvenie...

02:40.900 --> 02:43.020
THEY YELL

02:47.460 --> 02:49.300
Release!

02:49.300 --> 02:50.500
Release. Release!

02:50.500 --> 02:52.700
Maybe it's my tone of voice.

02:52.700 --> 02:53.980
It's there!

02:56.420 --> 02:57.860
Call it!

02:57.860 --> 02:59.620
Now!

03:03.460 --> 03:06.140
THEY YELL

03:10.260 --> 03:12.060
What a relief.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.340
Right! No-one gets away with
doing that to us, Yaz.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.580
What was it he said?

03:20.580 --> 03:22.820
Final few hours of planet Earth?

03:24.220 --> 03:26.860
He doesn't get rid of us
that easily.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.260
Not enough.

04:15.260 --> 04:19.300
It's not enough.
We need more workers.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.340
Returned soldiers, the poor -

04:22.340 --> 04:26.180
they must all be brought here
and put to work.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.860
HE SIGHS
Still far to go.

04:28.860 --> 04:30.180
Of course, sir.

04:31.260 --> 04:34.940
May I also remind you
Mr Stonehouse is due shortly?

04:36.180 --> 04:39.180
Williamson, for the love of God,
what are you doing here?

04:39.180 --> 04:40.820
Why all this digging?

04:40.820 --> 04:44.540
I provide work and wages for those
who would not otherwise find it.

04:44.540 --> 04:46.060
Is that not enough?

04:46.060 --> 04:48.180
Of course, it is laudable.

04:48.180 --> 04:51.380
But do you not think about
what you are creating?

04:51.380 --> 04:53.820
I think very deeply about it.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.540
More deeply than you can
possibly know.

04:58.540 --> 05:02.420
Then why can I see
no rational plan at work here?

05:02.420 --> 05:04.940
The designs are eccentric.
The work is random.

05:04.940 --> 05:10.100
And, as for the tunnels being
excavated, they are without purpose.

05:10.100 --> 05:11.820
Without purpose?!

05:11.820 --> 05:14.340
If I were to speak to you
about their true purpose,

05:14.340 --> 05:16.860
your mind would buckle
under the pressure.

05:16.860 --> 05:19.020
With respect, sir...

05:19.020 --> 05:23.260
..of the two of us,
my mind is clearly

05:23.260 --> 05:25.820
the more robust and rational.

05:27.340 --> 05:31.420
Do you imagine what lies ahead
can be defeated with rationale?

05:33.180 --> 05:34.660
And pray, Mr Williamson...

05:36.100 --> 05:39.540
..what do you imagine
to lie ahead of us?

05:41.180 --> 05:42.780
The cataclysmic.

05:44.180 --> 05:45.580
The impossible.

06:01.500 --> 06:04.700
Doesn't matter
where you go in the world,

06:04.700 --> 06:08.220
it could be the greatest museums
in the biggest cities -

06:08.220 --> 06:11.420
none of them have got
what we've got right here.

06:11.420 --> 06:16.340
Nobody has got a top floor
like the Museum of Liverpool

06:16.340 --> 06:20.060
cos nobody has got our history.

06:21.580 --> 06:25.860
Over there, we've got the writers.
Over there, the musicians.

06:25.860 --> 06:29.100
And over there, the footballers.
These are massive.

06:29.100 --> 06:32.980
They're the pinnacle of
this building and this city.

06:32.980 --> 06:34.780
These define us.

06:34.780 --> 06:37.380
These make Liverpool.

06:37.380 --> 06:39.660
Dan! Dan!

06:40.860 --> 06:42.020
That's enough from me now.

06:42.020 --> 06:43.820
I'll let you have a look around
on your own.

06:45.980 --> 06:47.420
All right, Di?

06:49.180 --> 06:51.860
How many times?
Dan, you've got to stop.

06:51.860 --> 06:53.660
You don't work here.
You're not a guide.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.100
Stop pretending to be official.

06:55.100 --> 06:56.940
I am official! Official Scouse.

06:58.740 --> 07:00.380
Just think of me as a free exhibit,

07:00.380 --> 07:02.500
just a little bit livelier
than the others.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.300
Lad, you've got a trade - do that.

07:04.300 --> 07:06.700
I know, but I'm good at this.

07:06.700 --> 07:09.100
And I'm only chatting.
I make your punters happy.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.300
What's the point of being alive
if it's not to make others happy?

07:12.300 --> 07:15.140
Alan says, if you do it again,
he'll ban you permanently.

07:15.140 --> 07:17.420
What if we say just mornings? No!

07:18.660 --> 07:21.100
So...we still on for
Halloween drinks tonight?

07:21.100 --> 07:24.220
Yeah, yeah. Unless you've changed
your mind. No!

07:24.220 --> 07:26.580
No, I haven't.
No, good, me neither.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.260
Eight o'clock,
the corner of Lark Lane?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.860
It's a date! Yeah!

07:31.860 --> 07:34.060
Not a date date, I'm not presuming,
yeah? No. Yeah.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.700
Yeah, OK.

07:38.780 --> 07:40.300
I've got to go.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.620
And don't keep me waiting, you,
the late Dan Lewis!

07:42.620 --> 07:44.180
Not tonight!

07:44.180 --> 07:46.020
SHE LAUGHS
Go on!

07:52.060 --> 07:54.420
That's the fourth time. I know.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.660
This is the simplest trajectory.
Earth! We should be there already.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.300
What's wrong with you?

08:02.380 --> 08:06.180
Psychic connection reactivating,
Doctor.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.500
Who's that?

08:07.500 --> 08:09.140
How am I seeing this?

08:09.140 --> 08:10.620
Sssh.

08:11.660 --> 08:12.900
Just watch.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.140
RASPY BREATHING

08:24.100 --> 08:25.220
BEEP

08:30.380 --> 08:34.020
Still alive, after all this time.

08:34.020 --> 08:36.260
How long has it been here?

08:36.260 --> 08:40.100
Imprisoned since the dawn of the
universe, that's what I was told.

08:40.100 --> 08:42.540
People embellish, though.
Our job is to ensure

08:42.540 --> 08:44.860
all incarceration systems
are still functional

08:44.860 --> 08:46.220
and get the hell out.

08:47.420 --> 08:49.980
Evaluation report on prisoner Swarm.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.660
Confinement location -

08:51.660 --> 08:55.540
remnants of the Burnished Rage
battleground.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.980
Incarceration systems remain active.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.700
Approaching prisoner
for distanced live check.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.580
Do not engage with the prisoner
in conversation.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.980
Do not do anything that it asks,

09:07.980 --> 09:11.020
no matter what it asks,
or how persuasive it seems.

09:11.020 --> 09:14.300
I mean, obviously. I have
done my psych-resistance training.

09:19.020 --> 09:20.940
Containment chamber active.

09:22.620 --> 09:25.020
Physical securings still in place.

09:25.020 --> 09:28.460
Stratospheric impoundment systems
operative.

09:28.460 --> 09:30.900
Prisoner remains secure.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.580
Your last tour, En Sentac.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.380
How does it know that?

09:39.380 --> 09:45.100
How many times across the millennia
have you stared at me in silence?

09:46.620 --> 09:49.220
Now you're handing over your task...

09:51.020 --> 09:52.820
..to a child.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.620
The kid'll do fine.

09:55.620 --> 09:58.700
You're as confined
as you always have been

09:58.700 --> 10:00.740
and always will be.

10:05.580 --> 10:06.980
Wrong.

10:08.260 --> 10:11.340
RASPY LAUGH

10:12.700 --> 10:14.780
Containment chamber malfunction.

10:18.700 --> 10:21.900
Boss? Feeling paralysed?

10:21.900 --> 10:26.780
Proof that your life's work
has ended...

10:26.780 --> 10:29.180
..in failure.

10:30.180 --> 10:35.500
Your reward for admirable service
to Division.

10:48.660 --> 10:50.900
HE YELLS

11:03.540 --> 11:06.820
Aaaah!

11:09.620 --> 11:13.060
Renewed at last!

11:14.060 --> 11:15.340
What've you done?

11:18.940 --> 11:20.580
I waited.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.180
I planned.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.340
And now I'm going to execute.

11:33.580 --> 11:35.340
That won't work, child.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.300
Your time is over.

11:43.140 --> 11:44.740
As mine...

11:45.980 --> 11:47.980
..has begun once more.

11:49.820 --> 11:51.260
Huh!

11:56.020 --> 11:58.340
Trick or treat, Doctor?

12:02.820 --> 12:04.460
YAZ: Doctor!

12:04.460 --> 12:06.340
Doctor!

12:08.100 --> 12:09.940
Have you seen this?

12:09.940 --> 12:12.980
It's like the TARDIS is...leaking.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.460
SONIC SCREWDRIVER WHIRS

12:18.460 --> 12:20.420
Do you know what it is?

12:24.100 --> 12:25.660
Nothing to worry about. It's fine.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.820
I'm fine, TARDIS is fine.
We're all fine.

12:27.820 --> 12:29.660
We'll be on Earth any moment.

12:29.660 --> 12:32.500
Right, dateline. October 31st.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.540
Halloween! Trick or treat!

12:39.820 --> 12:44.180
Here, that'll see you right
for a bit. Thanks. Oh, and hang on.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.780
Take a couple of them for tonight,

12:45.780 --> 12:47.340
as long as you promise
not to haunt me.

12:47.340 --> 12:48.740
THEY LAUGH

12:48.740 --> 12:50.300
Look after yourselves, ta-ra.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.580
Come on.

12:55.220 --> 12:56.300
Here.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.100
Will I make up a box for you?

12:59.100 --> 13:00.780
No, I'm sound, thanks.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.580
Well, at least take some soup. Mmm?

13:04.580 --> 13:07.420
Wilma, who likes soup, really?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.460
Don't be proud, Daniel, come on.

13:09.460 --> 13:12.300
There's plenty of people
who need soup a lot more than me.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.740
And, anyway, my numbers
are coming up on Wednesday.

13:15.740 --> 13:17.380
You don't even play the lottery.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.340
I know, that's how lucky I am!
WHIRRING

13:19.340 --> 13:20.660
Wait.

13:21.860 --> 13:23.020
Did you see that?

13:24.980 --> 13:26.220
What?

13:26.220 --> 13:27.940
There's something out there.

13:30.820 --> 13:35.060
You've been on the sherry early
tonight. Come on, let's lock up.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.460
WHIRRING

14:02.020 --> 14:03.500
KNOCK AT DOOR

14:05.540 --> 14:07.740
Trick or treat!

14:07.740 --> 14:11.020
Oh-ho! You scared me there.

14:11.020 --> 14:13.660
Here. You can have the last ones.

14:13.660 --> 14:14.940
You look great.

14:14.940 --> 14:17.060
Go on, go safe now!

14:17.060 --> 14:18.420
Na-night.

14:23.620 --> 14:25.020
KNOCK AT DOOR

14:27.100 --> 14:28.620
All right, la?

14:30.740 --> 14:32.900
Trick or treat?

14:33.900 --> 14:35.620
No.

14:35.620 --> 14:36.980
You what?

14:36.980 --> 14:39.180
How old are you?
What's the difference?

14:39.180 --> 14:40.700
You're not even dressed up.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.540
Yeah, well, neither are you.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.420
You're just going round,
knocking on people's doors!

14:45.420 --> 14:47.260
I heard you had sweets.

14:47.260 --> 14:49.660
Go on! Get off with yiz!

14:51.060 --> 14:53.260
Don't be throwing eggs at my house.

15:01.180 --> 15:02.820
HE SIGHS

15:11.700 --> 15:13.380
Take the soup, will you?

15:19.460 --> 15:22.300
Yes - gaze upon my might!

15:22.300 --> 15:24.180
What is it with you lot tonight?

15:24.180 --> 15:27.140
Kneel before the might
of the Lupari!

15:27.140 --> 15:28.620
You're paying for that door,
you know?

15:28.620 --> 15:30.060
Be silent!

15:30.060 --> 15:32.500
Or face execution

15:32.500 --> 15:35.660
at the hands of Karvanista,

15:35.660 --> 15:38.820
Vanquisher of
the Thousand Civilisations.

15:38.820 --> 15:41.020
Submit or die.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.100
Well, you've definitely
put the effort in.

15:43.100 --> 15:46.300
You will not resist.
You will do exactly as I command.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.340
I don't think I will.

15:51.340 --> 15:55.820
I said, you will not resist!
You will do exactly as I command!

15:55.820 --> 15:58.020
And I said,
get back out through that door

15:58.020 --> 15:59.900
or I'm getting the bizzies.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.740
BEEP
Why's that not working?

16:02.740 --> 16:05.180
What's the matter with you?
What's the matter with me?!

16:05.180 --> 16:06.380
I'm not the one going round

16:06.380 --> 16:08.540
smashing into people's houses
dressed as a dog.

16:09.820 --> 16:11.700
What did you just call me?

16:11.700 --> 16:14.700
I mean, it's good, like. It's...

16:14.700 --> 16:16.060
..cute.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.380
It looks dead soft.

16:17.380 --> 16:19.220
Is it real fur?

16:20.380 --> 16:22.820
You defile the sacred legacy
of my forebears!

16:22.820 --> 16:25.660
You don't look anything like
four bears. Go on, shoo!

16:25.660 --> 16:28.540
Get back to your mam, tell her
what a brave lad you've been.

16:33.740 --> 16:36.220
Never talk of my mother.

16:38.020 --> 16:40.100
METALLIC THRUMMING

16:46.620 --> 16:48.420
Liverpool.

16:48.420 --> 16:50.060
Anfield!

16:50.060 --> 16:52.060
Klopp era! Classic.

16:52.060 --> 16:54.300
Ooh, Yaz, maybe we could take in
a game.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.500
I've seen the Barcelona match
nine times.

16:56.500 --> 16:58.020
I was a ball boy for Trent, once.

16:59.380 --> 17:00.580
Hmm.

17:05.460 --> 17:06.700
Number 37.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.940
Non-terrestrial
weapon dispersal traces.

17:12.820 --> 17:13.820
KNOCKS ON DOOR

17:16.260 --> 17:18.180
And a door that's left open.

17:19.380 --> 17:20.620
Anyone home?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.780
I'm guessing single bloke,
definitely a Red.

17:30.780 --> 17:33.940
Someone's made a right mess in here.

17:35.340 --> 17:37.060
SONIC WHIRS

17:41.180 --> 17:42.940
Ugh. Stun cube.

17:42.940 --> 17:45.340
Lupari tech - Karvanista was here.

17:45.340 --> 17:48.380
Looks like he took whoever lived
here. Why would he do that?

17:49.860 --> 17:53.140
Daniel Lewis. This could be him.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.860
So where is he now?

17:54.860 --> 17:58.780
Ah. Quick check of planetary orbit.
Nice laptop, Dan.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.740
Right.

18:06.820 --> 18:10.660
There! 7.2 minutes ago,
Karvanista's ship,

18:10.660 --> 18:13.740
leaving Earth,
shielded against detection.

18:13.740 --> 18:16.420
We're just behind him.
So where's he going?

18:16.420 --> 18:19.020
Why am I getting multiple traces?

18:19.020 --> 18:20.460
Hang on while I zoom out.

18:31.420 --> 18:34.660
Seven billion Lupari ships
coming this way?

18:34.660 --> 18:36.420
That's an invasion fleet, right?

18:36.420 --> 18:38.260
It looks like it.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.740
Karvanista's species,
all heading here.

18:40.740 --> 18:42.580
Why was he ahead of them?

18:42.580 --> 18:45.260
And why did take the bloke
that lives here?

18:45.260 --> 18:48.860
Also one other thing
that's bugging me, tiny detail -

18:48.860 --> 18:51.300
why does Dan have
such a flashy computer?

18:51.300 --> 18:53.140
BOTH: Because it's not his!

18:53.140 --> 18:54.380
Aah! Get out!

19:06.500 --> 19:07.940
CRUMPLING

19:07.940 --> 19:10.020
Whoops.
TOILET FLUSHES

19:11.420 --> 19:12.740
BOTH: Sorry!

19:18.980 --> 19:21.180
Hey, what've you done with
the chillies?

19:23.180 --> 19:25.980
Have you tried the fridge?
Why would they be in the fridge?

19:25.980 --> 19:29.100
Well, sometimes you put them
in the fridge. I do not!

19:30.540 --> 19:32.740
OPENS FRIDGE
They're in the fridge.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.540
Amazing.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.220
SHE LAUGHS

19:36.220 --> 19:39.100
BEEPING

19:49.780 --> 19:51.380
What do we do?

19:51.380 --> 19:52.700
I don't know.

19:53.820 --> 19:55.380
Can we ignore it?

19:55.380 --> 19:57.780
They promised this would never
happen.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.820
Except in the gravest of
emergencies.

20:10.020 --> 20:11.460
We didn't receive the warning.

20:13.540 --> 20:14.940
Come on.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.820
Let's eat.

20:29.700 --> 20:31.740
METAL SCRAPES

20:33.380 --> 20:35.100
A dog shot me!

20:35.100 --> 20:36.940
How can a dog shoot me?

20:36.940 --> 20:38.380
Ow!

20:38.380 --> 20:41.900
The bars on that holding pen
are electrified.

20:41.900 --> 20:43.460
What am I doing in here?

20:44.620 --> 20:46.300
Hang on - holding pen?

20:46.300 --> 20:48.020
I'm not an animal!

20:48.020 --> 20:50.820
No. Animals know when to be silent.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.260
You wait till I get out of here.
Why, what are you gonna do?

20:53.260 --> 20:55.860
I'm gonna report you. To who?

20:57.060 --> 20:59.700
I'm gonna report you for
kidnapping, what d'you think of
that?

20:59.700 --> 21:02.140
Well, that's what's happening,
so...

21:02.140 --> 21:04.900
BLOWS
..fine. What?

21:04.900 --> 21:06.180
You're mine.

21:07.740 --> 21:10.700
And I'm taking you off-world.
What do you mean, off-world?

21:21.100 --> 21:22.460
That's space.

21:22.460 --> 21:25.940
And they say
you're a low IQ species.

21:25.940 --> 21:27.700
Well done.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.500
We're travelling away
from your planet, through space,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.460
on my spaceship.

21:37.020 --> 21:41.300
Aww. Look at your little brain,
trying to work it all out.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.940
Embarrassing.

21:42.940 --> 21:44.300
Why, though?

21:45.780 --> 21:48.060
Why are you doing this?
What's so special about me?

21:48.060 --> 21:50.700
Nothing.
There's nothing special about you.

21:50.700 --> 21:55.340
You're insignificant,
irrelevant and utterly meaningless.

21:55.340 --> 21:56.980
You've gone to a lot of trouble

21:56.980 --> 21:59.420
to kidnap someone
who's completely irrelevant.

21:59.420 --> 22:03.460
Maybe I should just kill you, yeah?
I could, right here.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.940
Yeah, but you haven't, though,
have you?

22:05.940 --> 22:09.860
No. You're not going to kill me. You
could've done that in my kitchen.

22:09.860 --> 22:12.020
If you've gone to all this trouble
to kidnap me,

22:12.020 --> 22:13.980
killing me wouldn't make sense.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.900
I'm done talking to you.

22:16.900 --> 22:19.740
I'm right, though, aren't I?
Go on!

22:19.740 --> 22:21.020
Off you go.

22:21.020 --> 22:22.980
Hang on! Come back!

22:22.980 --> 22:24.980
Where are we actually going?

22:24.980 --> 22:28.460
Compressor blast -
tripped by the sonic.

22:30.060 --> 22:33.140
He's deliberately leaving traps
in case he's followed.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.500
Clever AND dangerous,
our Karvanista.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.220
So why are you obsessed
with following him?

22:39.540 --> 22:41.220
I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:41.220 --> 22:43.820
"I need to see a man about a dog,"
that's all you said.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.180
But it turns out the man IS a dog,
and he's called Karvanista

22:46.180 --> 22:48.380
and you won't tell me
why you are so interested in him!

22:50.420 --> 22:52.860
Oh, my God! Doctor!

22:52.860 --> 22:55.300
Who's that? I have no idea.

22:57.100 --> 23:00.100
I didn't expect to see you here -
not tonight.

23:00.100 --> 23:03.700
Hi. Really sorry, we're in the
middle of something quite important.

23:03.700 --> 23:06.500
Have we met? Not yet, but we will.

23:06.500 --> 23:09.540
In the past - I think - if it's
true.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.140
I'm Claire.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.980
If what's true, Claire?

23:13.980 --> 23:16.180
You don't seem too sure
about your past.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.300
Oh, God, look at your faces.

23:18.300 --> 23:20.260
I know I sound like a loon.

23:20.260 --> 23:23.020
Don't let me distract you.
I didn't even know you'd be here.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.540
I was just...

23:24.540 --> 23:26.380
..taking the long way home...

23:28.180 --> 23:29.660
..cos it's Halloween.

23:31.020 --> 23:32.500
SONIC WHIRS

23:36.020 --> 23:38.740
Lupari fleet is getting closer.

23:38.740 --> 23:40.940
We don't have any more time.
Come on, Yaz.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.900
It's OK.

23:43.900 --> 23:45.700
We'll see each other again.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.100
Look after yourself.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.700
Whoa. That's not right.

23:55.420 --> 23:58.460
The door's moved. Yeah.

23:58.460 --> 24:00.780
That's never happened before.

24:00.780 --> 24:02.220
No.

24:06.060 --> 24:08.020
You've got to go home now, Claire.

24:14.900 --> 24:18.420
Right, let's get a lock
on Karvanista. Co-pilot?

24:18.420 --> 24:20.980
Course. Sending Karvanista's
Craft ID.

24:20.980 --> 24:23.420
Cross-referencing with
spatial-temporal locations.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.700
I'll restrict to this solar system
and time zone for exact trajectory.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.140
Yeah. I'll jam his radar

24:28.140 --> 24:31.780
and find a sweet spot on his ship
for us to land unnoticed.

24:35.220 --> 24:36.700
Ah.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.780
Final adjustment? Final adjustment.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.260
METALLIC THRUMMING

24:43.260 --> 24:44.580
Right.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.060
What are you doing? Checking
all systems for malfunctions.

24:50.060 --> 24:55.340
Also, quick MOT check on my mind,
had a little glitch earlier.

24:55.340 --> 24:57.740
What sort of glitch?
You didn't mention it.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.700
You know what, Yaz?
I don't mention everything.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.580
No kidding. Are you being mardy?

25:03.660 --> 25:06.580
What sort of glitch? A glitchy
glitch! What does it matter?

25:06.580 --> 25:09.820
Because I thought we were friends.
We are friends!

25:09.820 --> 25:11.780
Then why won't you let me in?

25:11.780 --> 25:14.260
What's going on with you?
Nothing is going on with me.

25:14.260 --> 25:15.740
Don't lie.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.340
Have we not had a good time
together?

25:21.340 --> 25:22.580
Since Ryan and Graham left,

25:22.580 --> 25:25.180
have I not taken you to
amazing places? Of course, but...

25:25.180 --> 25:27.820
I thought I was showing you
experiences of a lifetime.

25:27.820 --> 25:31.460
You're hiding something - about him.

25:31.460 --> 25:35.140
About why you tracked him down
in the first place.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.380
Tell me.

25:36.380 --> 25:37.980
CRASH

25:41.220 --> 25:42.860
What was that?

25:46.780 --> 25:49.340
Temporal residue surrounding
Karvanista's ship.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.620
Is it us or him? Him. Very much him.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.660
It's like his ship's covered in it.
That shouldn't be happening.

25:55.660 --> 25:57.700
We're pushing through it to land.

25:59.540 --> 26:01.180
Nothing's as it should be, Yaz.

26:02.180 --> 26:04.260
Too much out of the ordinary
tonight.

26:43.380 --> 26:44.780
Mustn't blink.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.380
If you blink, it'll move.

26:49.380 --> 26:50.740
Don't blink.

27:01.220 --> 27:02.580
SHE GASPS

27:12.020 --> 27:13.660
SHE WHIMPERS

27:29.500 --> 27:30.860
SHE GASPS

27:36.860 --> 27:38.300
Don't blink...

27:49.940 --> 27:52.060
DOOR CREAKS

27:57.940 --> 28:01.980
The universe is looking
particularly beautiful today.

28:01.980 --> 28:06.860
Observation Officer Vinder
reporting, as per assigned duty.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.620
Status Report rotation number...

28:09.620 --> 28:12.060
..21,754.

28:12.060 --> 28:15.420
No activity. No change in status.

28:15.420 --> 28:18.020
Summary...constant.

28:18.020 --> 28:24.740
Everything remains as per
my previous 21,753 reports.

28:24.740 --> 28:27.020
Nothing has changed.

28:27.020 --> 28:30.420
Nothing ever changes,

28:30.420 --> 28:32.500
but then you know that.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.700
Additional comments -
my spirits remain high.

28:35.700 --> 28:39.580
While there is
little or no activity...

28:41.100 --> 28:46.300
..the sheer beauty of
what I can see is...

28:47.500 --> 28:48.740
..unimaginable.

28:49.940 --> 28:54.860
I am lucky to observe that
which few others will ever see.

28:54.860 --> 28:58.460
For that, at least, I thank you.

28:59.620 --> 29:02.140
In all other respects,
I conclude this report

29:02.140 --> 29:04.340
with my usual sign-off request -

29:04.340 --> 29:06.020
that you all go to hell.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.060
ALERT

29:13.300 --> 29:14.740
System?

29:14.740 --> 29:17.780
Yes, commander.
Amplify Thoribus Section.

29:17.780 --> 29:19.620
Of course. Amplifying.

29:20.820 --> 29:23.060
What is that?

29:23.060 --> 29:28.100
System, analyse, and focus
on the Thoribus Trifecta.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.700
Analysing Thoribus Trifecta.

29:30.700 --> 29:32.820
Unknown phenomena detected.

29:32.820 --> 29:34.420
Analysing.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.460
Anomalous property detected.

29:36.460 --> 29:38.900
What in the name of the saints...?

29:51.700 --> 29:55.420
Thoribus Minor destroyed.
Unknown phenomena approaching.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.300
Outpost Rose is compromised.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.860
Emergency status update -
urgent warning transmission!

30:42.380 --> 30:44.500
HE GASPS

30:44.500 --> 30:46.140
Jan?

30:47.340 --> 30:49.020
Don't touch anything!

30:51.020 --> 30:52.580
HE SCREAMS

30:52.580 --> 30:54.260
SHE SCREAMS

31:00.340 --> 31:03.780
Why is this thought in my mind?

31:03.780 --> 31:05.620
What thought?

31:07.660 --> 31:08.900
Thank you.

31:17.940 --> 31:20.220
My sister.

31:21.860 --> 31:23.820
How I have missed you.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.820
METALLIC THRUMMING

31:35.980 --> 31:38.300
So we think this Dan bloke
is somewhere on board?

31:38.300 --> 31:41.100
Yeah. Now, just going to take out
his security systems

31:41.100 --> 31:43.540
before we get spotted
and lay another hack.

31:43.540 --> 31:44.820
Here, hold this.

31:46.460 --> 31:48.340
Where is it?
TOY SQUEAKS

31:48.340 --> 31:49.500
Ah!

31:50.740 --> 31:53.580
Leftover hopper virus particles
should do the trick.

31:55.660 --> 31:59.300
Right. You find Dan and I'll
confront Karvanista. Meet back here.

31:59.300 --> 32:01.900
Confront him? D'you not remember
how that ended up last time?

32:01.900 --> 32:04.540
Yeah! We got away. Doctor!
The prisoner hold's down that way.

32:04.540 --> 32:06.980
If you hear gunfire or explosions,
get back sharpish.

32:06.980 --> 32:07.980
Synchronise watches.

32:07.980 --> 32:10.420
Forget that, I'm not wearing
a watch. Any questions?

32:10.420 --> 32:12.060
No? See you soon.

32:14.660 --> 32:18.140
"Does that make sense to you, Yaz?"
Not really, Doctor, no.

32:18.140 --> 32:20.380
Karvanista to Lupari command -

32:20.380 --> 32:23.060
unknown temporal propulsion
has been corrected.

32:23.060 --> 32:26.780
Now activating strategic formation
realignment to re-join battalion.

32:26.780 --> 32:30.340
Also sharing mission intel
of Earth festival Halloween,

32:30.340 --> 32:33.060
which may affect
some operational deployments.

32:33.060 --> 32:35.020
I've got a bone to pick with you.

32:36.020 --> 32:37.740
Oh, come on!

32:37.740 --> 32:40.100
How many traps do I have to leave
to get rid of you?

32:40.100 --> 32:42.940
More than you have done so far.
I don't have time for you right now.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.540
You're going to make time.

32:47.180 --> 32:48.500
POWERING DOWN

32:48.500 --> 32:50.860
Did you just shut my ship down?

32:50.860 --> 32:53.500
Yes, I did.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.500
And now your weapon as well.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.740
Cos I've tracked you down
across half the universe,

32:57.740 --> 33:00.980
and you are going to stand there
while I tell you two things.

33:00.980 --> 33:03.460
Number one,
the Lupari Invasion of Earth is off.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.340
What are you talking about?
I couldn't be clearer.

33:07.340 --> 33:11.260
You tell the rest of your people
to stay away from Earth.

33:11.260 --> 33:12.780
It is protected.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.220
It's protected...

33:16.260 --> 33:19.060
Protected by me,

33:19.060 --> 33:20.500
to be clear.

33:20.500 --> 33:22.540
Number two -

33:22.540 --> 33:26.260
you're going to tell me everything
you know about the Division.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.060
Dan Lewis, right?

33:29.060 --> 33:30.460
Ow!

33:30.460 --> 33:32.820
Might be. Who are you?

33:32.820 --> 33:35.380
Rescue party.
Keep quiet and stay still.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.900
It looks like this holding pen
has...

33:37.900 --> 33:39.780
..nine different booby traps.

33:39.780 --> 33:41.620
How do you know that?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.460
I've had a lot of experience
of getting out of places like this.

33:44.460 --> 33:46.420
Bear with me.
Where've you come from?

33:46.420 --> 33:48.740
Why, fussy about
who you get rescued by?

33:48.740 --> 33:51.380
How do I know I can trust you?
You might be with the dog fella.

33:51.380 --> 33:53.980
Does this look like
a face you can trust? Maybe.

33:53.980 --> 33:55.180
Maybe?

33:55.180 --> 33:56.700
Are you an alien, too?

33:56.700 --> 33:59.220
I'm Yaz. Yasmin Khan.

33:59.220 --> 34:01.740
Formerly PC Yasmin Khan
of Hallamshire Police.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.180
Very human, very much
not with the dog fella.

34:04.180 --> 34:07.100
Hallamshire. What, like Sheffield?!

34:07.100 --> 34:09.620
Why, what's the matter
with Sheffield? Too near Leeds.

34:09.620 --> 34:13.340
Pro tip, Dan Lewis -
don't diss the designated rescuer.

34:13.340 --> 34:15.340
How are you here
if you're from Sheffield?

34:15.340 --> 34:16.780
Got a mate who's an alien.

34:16.780 --> 34:18.260
Does he look like a dog?

34:18.260 --> 34:22.660
No. But she's got her own ship
and we can get you back to Earth.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.500
You can come out.
And the bars won't zap me?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.780
Not if I've done it properly,
which I'm pretty sure I have.

34:27.780 --> 34:29.980
How sure? Well, y'know,
life's a gamble.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.500
LAUGHS

34:36.260 --> 34:37.460
Nice work, girl.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.100
Yaz is fine.
And I don't want to hear

34:39.100 --> 34:41.140
another word
against Yorkshire again.

34:41.140 --> 34:43.820
Come on. We're meeting the Doctor
back at our ship,

34:43.820 --> 34:46.580
assuming nothing goes wrong.
Why, do things often go wrong?

34:46.580 --> 34:47.860
Come on!

34:47.860 --> 34:49.580
Stop asking about the Division.

34:51.700 --> 34:53.900
That's not a question I can answer.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.180
Yes, you can.

34:56.180 --> 34:57.580
You have to.

34:59.020 --> 35:01.380
I've spent a long time
hunting you down.

35:01.380 --> 35:04.100
You are the only known Division
operative I can find alive.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.700
The only one who can...

35:05.700 --> 35:07.980
Right, sorry, park that.
What is that call sign?

35:07.980 --> 35:09.900
Why is it bothering me so much?

35:09.900 --> 35:12.620
Species recall. Universal pattern.

35:12.620 --> 35:14.460
That's it. Thank you!

35:14.460 --> 35:17.740
No, what? Wait. You're on
Species Recall? Right now?

35:17.740 --> 35:20.220
The Lupari are species-bonded
to humanity.

35:20.220 --> 35:23.540
For every human, there's
a paired guardian Lupar.

35:23.540 --> 35:26.860
The bond is our genetic obligation,
and our honour,

35:26.860 --> 35:29.820
only ever to come into effect
in the ultimate crisis.

35:29.820 --> 35:32.900
But that would mean
you're not abducting Dan, then.

35:32.900 --> 35:37.460
I'm saving him, you idiot!
Every Lupar has a designated human.

35:37.460 --> 35:40.460
He's mine! We have to save them
before it's too late.

35:40.460 --> 35:43.300
But you used a stun cube on him!
Just because we have to save them

35:43.300 --> 35:45.780
doesn't mean I have to like him!
They're infuriating.

35:45.780 --> 35:50.020
Seven billion ships.
Seven billion humans.

35:50.020 --> 35:51.500
Man's best friend.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.660
Not if you don't power up my ship!

35:53.660 --> 35:55.700
But what is it
you're saving them from?

35:55.700 --> 35:56.940
You don't know?

35:57.980 --> 36:00.580
I've been busy. The Flux.

36:00.580 --> 36:02.100
What's the Flux?

36:02.100 --> 36:06.260
A hurricane, ripping through
the structure of this universe,

36:06.260 --> 36:08.500
disrupting every particle.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.140
The falling of the structure
of the universe.

36:11.140 --> 36:14.580
A cataclysm of unknown proportions
or patterns. We...

36:14.580 --> 36:16.220
We don't know for sure.

36:16.220 --> 36:17.820
And when is this Flux due to happen?

36:17.820 --> 36:19.660
It's already begun.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.820
VINDER: Update from
Thoribus Trifecta.

36:25.820 --> 36:28.860
Three planets now compromised.

36:28.860 --> 36:31.780
Wait, no, I don't mean compromised.

36:31.780 --> 36:34.420
I mean destroyed. Disintegrated.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.620
Er...but not by weapons.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.500
Like they were folding in
on themselves

36:39.500 --> 36:42.420
because of proximity to...
I don't know what.

36:42.420 --> 36:43.740
System?

36:43.740 --> 36:46.700
Catastrophic event
compromising base-level integrity

36:46.700 --> 36:48.300
of all structures.

36:48.300 --> 36:52.380
You mean something
is erasing this galaxy?

36:52.380 --> 36:54.020
Warning. Urgent update.

36:54.020 --> 36:56.860
Observation Outpost Rose
will be compromised.

36:56.860 --> 36:59.300
Evacuation procedures
urgently recommended.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.900
You hear that system advice?

37:00.900 --> 37:06.060
This is Serving Commander Inston-Vee
Vinder of Kasto-Winfer-Foxfell,

37:06.060 --> 37:09.340
doing the unthinkable
and leaving his post.

37:09.340 --> 37:11.660
Escape procedures activated.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.900
Survival pod ejection imminent.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.500
Data, I need data.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.100
What causes this Flux
and where does it start?

37:23.100 --> 37:25.300
I don't know,
I don't have a guidebook to it!

37:25.300 --> 37:28.300
The other side of the universe
or somewhere. Now unblock

37:28.300 --> 37:31.180
my ship's systems! I need to
re-align with my battalion.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.180
Fine. Doing it.

37:33.180 --> 37:35.620
But I'm keeping your weapons
powered down.

37:35.620 --> 37:38.100
It doesn't make any sense.

37:38.100 --> 37:39.820
You're moving away from Earth

37:39.820 --> 37:41.940
while the rest are travelling
towards it.

37:41.940 --> 37:44.380
My ship hit a time disturbance
at the head of the battalion.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.620
It meant I got to Earth a few hours
ahead of the others.

37:46.620 --> 37:49.060
And your battalion aim to
transport humanity off Earth

37:49.060 --> 37:50.660
before the Flux hits.

37:50.660 --> 37:54.140
That's what species bond means -
to protect when called upon.

37:54.140 --> 37:56.220
And how will this ship
survive the Flux?

37:56.220 --> 37:58.380
Our Survival Battalion
was engineered and built

37:58.380 --> 38:00.540
to weather whatever the Flux
can throw at us.

38:00.540 --> 38:02.940
Once the humans are on board,
the individual ships unite

38:02.940 --> 38:05.500
to form a long-term
survival structure. Clever.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.540
Except has anyone asked humanity
about this?

38:07.540 --> 38:09.260
Cos I think they're gonna
have an opinion!

38:09.260 --> 38:12.100
We don't need to ask them!
We're protecting them!

38:12.100 --> 38:14.860
Yeah, well, we don't
want your protection!

38:14.860 --> 38:18.060
We were supposed to be
sneaking in quietly. Sorry.

38:18.060 --> 38:20.900
Did you release him? Yeah, I did.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.980
And that's payback
for dangling me over boiling acid!

38:23.980 --> 38:25.260
Oh!

38:25.260 --> 38:27.700
All systems back online,
including weapons.

38:27.700 --> 38:29.900
Right. Plan modifications,
two stages.

38:29.900 --> 38:35.340
One, this is not over, between me
and you. We are not done. Two - run!

38:37.580 --> 38:39.420
Dan, Doctor, Doctor, Dan!

38:39.420 --> 38:41.260
All right, Doc?
Nice to meet you, Dan!

38:41.260 --> 38:42.460
Run for your life!

38:43.780 --> 38:45.940
Give me back my human!
That's my human!

38:45.940 --> 38:47.740
I'm not your human!

38:50.620 --> 38:52.420
You said it was a ship!
That's not a ship!

38:52.420 --> 38:55.700
It is! Get in! Why have you put
the door in the floor?!

38:55.700 --> 38:57.900
Bit of a daft place to have a door,
isn't it?

38:57.900 --> 39:00.740
Seem to have a surplus of doors
right now, I'm not sure why.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.700
Is all this inside that box?

39:05.220 --> 39:06.580
It's bigger on the inside.

39:06.580 --> 39:08.060
I can see that.

39:08.060 --> 39:10.300
It's called a TARDIS.
I had a mate who had one of these.

39:10.300 --> 39:13.140
I think his was a bit bigger,
actually. Shut up.

39:15.180 --> 39:17.500
By the way, here's your house.

39:18.460 --> 39:20.620
What? How did that happen?

39:20.620 --> 39:23.660
Karvanista set a trap up for us,
which miniaturised it.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.180
I can't live in that!

39:25.180 --> 39:26.780
Right now you don't have a house.

39:26.780 --> 39:29.780
Very soon, you may not have a planet
and there may not be a universe.

39:29.780 --> 39:30.900
Is she joking?

39:32.020 --> 39:33.260
Are you joking?

39:33.260 --> 39:35.900
Not joking. I'm trying to locate
an event called the Flux.

39:35.900 --> 39:39.820
Karvanista seems to think it will
overwhelm most of the universe.

39:39.820 --> 39:41.380
And you're looking for it?

39:41.380 --> 39:42.580
We are.

39:44.020 --> 39:45.420
Why don't I know about this?

39:45.420 --> 39:47.260
And who else does?

40:12.020 --> 40:13.860
Finally!

40:13.860 --> 40:19.100
Psychic Surveyor Kragar,
concluding assessment, Commander.

40:19.100 --> 40:22.020
It has been a long time,
old comrade.

40:22.020 --> 40:23.620
You look old.

40:23.620 --> 40:26.700
My mission has...withered me,
it is true.

40:26.700 --> 40:29.620
Really, you look disgusting.

40:29.620 --> 40:33.420
Yes. Well, no point dwelling on it.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.780
Really disgusting.

40:35.780 --> 40:37.140
Continue.

40:37.140 --> 40:39.300
I have analysed the psychic waves

40:39.300 --> 40:41.620
and it is my privilege to report

40:41.620 --> 40:44.460
the cataclysm approaches.

40:44.460 --> 40:47.460
The Flux is imminent.

40:47.460 --> 40:50.620
I forecast incredible suffering.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.660
Vast bloodshed.

40:52.660 --> 40:56.740
A conflict that will dwarf
all that has come before.

40:58.300 --> 41:00.780
The greatest of times are upon us!

41:00.780 --> 41:03.660
We must be ready to take advantage.

41:03.660 --> 41:05.460
My old friend,

41:05.460 --> 41:07.700
I find myself...

41:07.700 --> 41:09.540
..excited.

41:09.540 --> 41:13.060
Yes...
THEY LAUGH

41:19.860 --> 41:21.500
Why have you brought us here?

41:22.780 --> 41:25.140
Multiple readings? It's one event!

41:25.140 --> 41:27.140
I said, "Trace one event"!

41:27.140 --> 41:29.620
In all of time and space,
you bring us here. Why?

41:29.620 --> 41:31.460
Who's she talking to?

41:31.460 --> 41:32.900
The TARDIS.

41:32.900 --> 41:35.940
What...is it alive?

41:35.940 --> 41:38.380
No idea, but they do chat.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.420
It's brought us to the edge
of your solar system.

41:40.420 --> 41:43.300
Doesn't make any sense.
There's nothing here.

41:51.180 --> 41:53.820
Whoa. When you say nothing...

41:54.980 --> 41:56.460
Yeah.

41:56.460 --> 42:00.140
Nothing here,
except an amazing view.

42:01.340 --> 42:03.740
How can we breathe?
Protective air bubble.

42:05.380 --> 42:08.660
I'll take your word for it.
BELL CHIMES

42:10.260 --> 42:12.300
What is it? The Cloister Bell.

42:12.300 --> 42:14.100
CLOISTER BELL CHIMES
It's a warning.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.740
Of what?
The TARDIS is worried.

42:15.740 --> 42:17.260
What's that?

42:20.620 --> 42:22.260
The Flux.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.060
This is what the Lupari have seen.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.500
What they were trying to protect
humanity from.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.740
What's it doing?

42:29.820 --> 42:32.460
Disobeying every law of time
and space.

42:32.460 --> 42:35.020
Disrupting every particle
it comes into contact with.

42:55.980 --> 42:58.220
GASPS
Doctor, what's the matter?

42:58.220 --> 43:00.900
CLOISTER BELL CHIMING
I can feel it all.

43:02.100 --> 43:04.900
I can feel the universe breaking.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.860
But you can stop it, right?

43:06.860 --> 43:07.940
No.

43:19.900 --> 43:21.420
Hello again, Doctor.

43:24.300 --> 43:25.620
Who are you?

43:27.140 --> 43:29.060
They were so efficient.

43:30.300 --> 43:33.940
There is not a tiny corner of you
that remembers.

43:35.180 --> 43:36.620
Remembers what?

43:36.620 --> 43:38.020
You and I.

43:40.460 --> 43:43.220
Dancing across space and time.

43:45.540 --> 43:46.980
Locked in combat.

43:51.620 --> 43:56.100
And now, after so long apart,
we get to do it once more.

43:57.500 --> 43:58.940
I don't know you.

43:58.940 --> 44:00.100
Yet I know you.

44:01.780 --> 44:04.020
I remember every battle...

44:05.340 --> 44:07.260
..which gives me the advantage.

44:09.780 --> 44:12.140
Our final fight has begun.

44:13.340 --> 44:15.620
GASPS
Doctor!

44:15.620 --> 44:17.500
Are you all right?
Stop asking me that!

44:17.500 --> 44:18.860
CLOISTER BELL CHIMING

44:18.860 --> 44:21.500
Is it me, or does it look like
it's changing direction?

44:23.940 --> 44:26.140
It's like it's coming for us!
Get inside!

44:29.820 --> 44:31.100
TARDIS RUMBLES

44:31.100 --> 44:33.860
Do not stall on me now.
Taking evasive action.

44:33.860 --> 44:35.300
Sorry.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.740
Sorry!

44:37.740 --> 44:39.300
Really sorry!

44:39.300 --> 44:40.740
SMASH

44:40.740 --> 44:42.300
This is impossible.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.780
The end of the universe
is chasing us.

44:44.780 --> 44:47.660
So what are you doing?
The only thing I can do.

44:47.660 --> 44:49.340
If the Flux is coming for us...

44:49.340 --> 44:51.140
..then we're gonna head to Earth.

44:51.140 --> 44:53.380
What! What?!

44:57.140 --> 44:58.780
TARDIS calling Karvanista!

44:58.780 --> 45:01.700
Bring me back my human, now!

45:01.700 --> 45:03.180
DAN: I'm not your human!

45:03.180 --> 45:06.580
I am trying to save your worthless
life! Listen to me.

45:06.580 --> 45:09.420
We're approaching you fast
and the Flux is right behind us,

45:09.420 --> 45:12.060
following us, as we head to Earth.

45:12.060 --> 45:13.900
It can't be!
We don't have enough time

45:13.900 --> 45:15.940
to get all the humans
on board the ships!

45:15.940 --> 45:18.180
The battalion's
only on the edge of the planet!

45:18.180 --> 45:20.780
We have to have time, Doctor.
My family are there!

45:20.780 --> 45:22.980
Mine, too! And Di.

45:22.980 --> 45:25.060
I'm late to meet Diane!

45:34.220 --> 45:35.820
MYSTERIOUS VOICE: Diane.

45:37.260 --> 45:40.300
Inside the house.

45:40.300 --> 45:41.940
Come on in.

45:41.940 --> 45:46.180
I said, "Come on in."

45:52.500 --> 45:54.420
Stop walking, Di.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.340
Stop walking now.

46:00.180 --> 46:02.420
No...

46:02.420 --> 46:05.500
No, no...no!

46:10.180 --> 46:12.980
SPLASHING

46:12.980 --> 46:15.100
LAUGHTER

46:24.260 --> 46:26.420
We're going to have fun with you.

46:27.740 --> 46:30.460
I've got a plan here. There's only
one chance to survive this.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.180
Karvanista!
You said the battalion ships

46:33.180 --> 46:36.260
were designed to fit together
to form a protective structure.

46:36.260 --> 46:40.380
What about it? I'm sending you
a formation for the ships.

46:40.380 --> 46:43.380
Get it communicated to them
instantly. You have to move fast!

46:44.500 --> 46:46.300
What good will that do?
Just do it!

46:46.300 --> 46:48.740
That shape, that formation.

46:48.740 --> 46:50.500
Got to outrun this thing.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.500
YELLS

46:52.500 --> 46:55.060
We're being dragged
into the heart of the Flux.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.820
Can the TARDIS withstand it?

46:56.820 --> 46:58.700
I don't know! I don't understand it

46:58.700 --> 47:00.260
and I hate not understanding!

47:01.740 --> 47:03.820
Battalion positioned,
just as you ordered.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.780
Lock them in to the pattern now!

47:05.780 --> 47:08.260
This better work! You're telling me!

47:08.260 --> 47:10.900
Interlocking.
BEEP

47:18.340 --> 47:21.060
Lupari Battalion
now encasing Earth.

47:25.340 --> 47:28.140
It worked! The pattern worked!

47:28.140 --> 47:29.980
The battalion is shielding Earth!

47:29.980 --> 47:32.540
Your ships better be as good as
you say they are, Karvanista!

47:32.540 --> 47:34.740
What about you?

47:34.740 --> 47:37.700
Get your ship
behind that Battalion wall!

47:37.700 --> 47:39.140
Doing it now!

47:39.140 --> 47:41.540
THEY YELL

47:45.620 --> 47:47.020
Trouble, right?

47:47.020 --> 47:49.500
I can't get us out of its pull.

47:49.500 --> 47:51.340
We can't outrun it!

47:52.740 --> 47:55.580
But we're safe in here.
We're sealed in.

48:00.740 --> 48:04.100
Come on, Doctor. There must be
something you can do.

48:05.540 --> 48:07.780
One last throw of the dice.

48:09.580 --> 48:11.220
Get down!

48:16.300 --> 48:19.780
Flux, meet Vortex energy.

48:19.780 --> 48:21.580
See what that does to you!

48:23.940 --> 48:25.340
Ah!

48:25.340 --> 48:27.060
Not much, by the looks of things.

48:48.220 --> 48:53.660
Attack!

48:56.340 --> 48:58.580
The end of the universe.

48:59.980 --> 49:04.020
I always wondered
what it would feel like.

49:37.860 --> 49:40.700
Please tell me you're not about to
engage Sontarans in battle.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.220
Mrs Seacole to you.

49:42.220 --> 49:44.500
I accept your offer

49:44.500 --> 49:46.540
of a massacre!
