00:02.836 --> 00:04.295
<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:04.337 --> 00:05.755
- You let my horse come in
contact

00:05.797 --> 00:07.590
with some incurable disease?

00:07.632 --> 00:09.759
- Amy, look at this.
- Kirk.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.429
<i>- "Just experienced the most</i>
<i>unprofessional treatment ever."</i>

00:12.470 --> 00:14.264
If he keeps this up,
he could ruin us.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.433
- Maybe he'll stop
if we just ignore him.

00:16.474 --> 00:17.809
- It's like I was saying
to Jen last week--

00:17.851 --> 00:19.561
- You were talking to Jen
last week?

00:19.602 --> 00:22.772
- We just had dinner.
- What?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.983
- I know what I want.
I wanna go on trips

00:25.025 --> 00:28.528
to faraway places with you.
What do you want?

00:28.570 --> 00:31.406
- I dunno.
- Well, figure it out

00:31.448 --> 00:32.824
and let me know.
Tim: Just so we're clear,

00:32.866 --> 00:34.534
these horses are here
temporarily, right?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.077
- Yeah.

00:38.913 --> 00:47.464
**

00:47.505 --> 00:49.299
- Yup, yup, get up there.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.508
- Come on!
- Get up!

00:50.550 --> 00:51.926
- Come on!

00:51.968 --> 00:55.180
- Ho! Get up! Get up!

00:55.221 --> 00:57.849
Get up there!

00:57.891 --> 00:59.642
(Hooves thunder)

00:59.684 --> 01:09.652
**

01:09.694 --> 01:19.829
**

01:19.871 --> 01:30.340
**

01:30.382 --> 01:32.175
- You got the gate, Grandpa?
- Yes, sir!

01:32.217 --> 01:38.807
**

01:38.848 --> 01:40.725
- Hey!
- Get in there!

01:40.767 --> 01:42.852
- Yup! Ready. Yup!

01:42.894 --> 01:48.858
**

01:48.900 --> 01:50.235
- (Laughing)

01:54.656 --> 01:55.907
(Horses whinny in the distance)

01:55.949 --> 01:58.868
- So, have you two read Kirk's
latest post?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.079
- Thank you.
- Nope, and I don't plan on it.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.623
- Well, it's not all that bad.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.542
He still blames you and Amy
for everything,

02:05.583 --> 02:07.711
but he did stop short of
calling you murderers.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.045
- Oh, great, maybe we should
put that on a brochure:

02:10.088 --> 02:12.590
"Bring your horse to Heartland,
they're not murderers."

02:12.632 --> 02:16.428
- Don't worry so much about
what that lunatic says.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.805
Business will pick up,
you'll see.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.641
- Well, that's very optimistic
of you, Jack.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.726
(Tailgate bangs shut)
I hope, for your sake,

02:22.767 --> 02:24.352
he's right.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.860
- Oh, something smells good
in here.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.695
- Georgie and I made cookies.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.739
- Did you. Since when do you
bake?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.199
- Never. But Luke really knows
what he's doing, so...

02:38.241 --> 02:41.453
- I used to make these with
my mom all the time.

02:41.494 --> 02:42.620
We should probably get going.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.039
We don't wanna miss visiting
hours.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.000
- Okay, Ty's waiting for us in
the truck. I'll be right there.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.878
- All he's been talking about
all day has been seeing his mom.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.380
- That's all he's been
talking about all week.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.049
Hey, Lyndy's still not up
from her nap.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.675
Do you mind hanging out here
until we get back?

02:55.717 --> 02:56.968
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks. You're a lifesaver.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.637
(Phone rings)
Hello?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.181
Yeah, speaking.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.520
Okay. I'll-I'll let him know.
Thanks.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.730
(Phone beeps off)

03:11.649 --> 03:12.692
(Sighs heavily)

03:12.734 --> 03:15.403
Both: (Chuckling)

03:22.535 --> 03:25.038
- Something's wrong, isn't it?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.998
- Your mom's doctor called.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.000
- She canceled again.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.794
- She really wanted
to see you, Luke--

03:30.835 --> 03:32.796
- No, she doesn't!
- Yes, she does!

03:32.837 --> 03:34.506
She's just not feeling well
today.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.425
- Luke, come on!
Both: (Sigh heavily)

03:38.802 --> 03:48.770
**

03:48.812 --> 03:54.359
**

03:54.401 --> 03:56.653
* And at the break of day *

03:56.695 --> 03:59.572
* You sank into... *

03:59.614 --> 04:01.449
* Your dream *

04:01.491 --> 04:02.742
* You dreamer *

04:02.784 --> 04:05.453
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

04:05.495 --> 04:06.955

04:09.749 --> 04:13.461
* You dreamer *

(Birds chirp)

04:23.763 --> 04:24.931
- (Crying)

04:24.973 --> 04:27.726
<i>Ty: Hey, Luke?</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:29.436
<i>why don't you come out</i>
<i>so we can talk about this.</i>

04:29.477 --> 04:30.770
- Go away!

04:37.193 --> 04:39.988
- Luke, maybe you could write
your mom a letter.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.615
You know, it might...
make you feel better

04:42.657 --> 04:44.492
and I'm sure she would love
hearing from you.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.495
Luke?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.416
- Let's just give him some
space.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.796
I'm gonna be up in the yard
working on my motorcycle, Luke.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.506
If you're interested...

04:59.799 --> 05:01.509
that's where I'll be.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.352
(Hooves thud lightly)

05:11.978 --> 05:14.606
- You... you expecting company?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.525
- Nope.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.528
- Whoa... (Grunts)

05:22.655 --> 05:24.157
- Sorry to just drop in
like this,

05:24.199 --> 05:26.993
but I thought I'd introduce
myself.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.037
I'm Sam Langston.
Just bought Big River Ranch.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.625
- Uh, okay.
I'm Jack Bartlett and...

05:33.667 --> 05:35.126
- Tim Fleming.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.294
W-what happened to Gerald?

05:36.336 --> 05:38.338
I sold him that place last year.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.632
- Well, I think he realized
he was in over his head

05:40.674 --> 05:42.801
with the property. He was
pretty eager to sell, so...

05:45.011 --> 05:47.847
That's a pretty nice-looking
horse you have over there.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.850
- What, my horse?
Yeah, yeah, he's a good one.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
<i>His name's Champ.</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:55.063
- You weren't by any chance
thinkin' of selling him,

05:55.105 --> 05:56.773
were you?
- (Laughs) No...

05:56.815 --> 05:58.108
No, why?

05:58.149 --> 06:00.193
- Well, I just bought
the ranch.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.779
I figure I need a few good
horses, so...

06:02.821 --> 06:04.239
Let me know if you change
your mind?

06:04.280 --> 06:06.658
- I won't. But yeah, okay.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.035
- Hey, since you're the owner
of Big River now,

06:09.077 --> 06:11.079
I suspect you're aware that
we have a lease agreement

06:11.121 --> 06:12.747
<i>for grazing our cattle.</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:15.166
- I am.
- Okay, well,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.836
would you care to join us?
We can discuss that a bit.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.379
- Well, that's not necessary.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.841
I went over the paperwork,
everything seems in order.

06:22.882 --> 06:25.301
But actually, my concern is,
uh, those wild horses.

06:25.343 --> 06:28.930
- Oh, they're only here
temporarily. Right, Jack?

06:28.972 --> 06:32.058
- Well, I... I'm not here
to complain, actually.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.601
I'm here for a business
proposition.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.856
- Daddy!
(Door creaks open)

06:37.897 --> 06:39.858
- Hi, sleepyhead.

06:39.899 --> 06:40.942
Oh, nice bunny!

06:42.318 --> 06:43.903
You ready to get up?

06:43.945 --> 06:45.655
Oh...
(Phone rings)

06:45.697 --> 06:47.240
How was your sleep?

06:47.282 --> 06:48.867
Yeah.
(Phone beeps on)

06:49.951 --> 06:52.662
Lee, hey.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.623
Wha... How much more?

06:57.917 --> 06:58.960
What?

07:03.006 --> 07:04.424
- Hey.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.471
Can you hand me that spray
bottle on the cart over there?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.810
That's the one.

07:15.852 --> 07:16.895
Thank you.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.939
(Bottle spritzes,
rapid brushing)

07:23.276 --> 07:25.945
- How long have you had
this motorcycle?

07:25.987 --> 07:27.947
- Awhile.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.076
But I wanted one ever since
I was a kid.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.494
I dreamed of hitting the road

07:32.535 --> 07:34.954
and getting as far away
from home as possible.

07:34.996 --> 07:37.457
- You wanted to run away?
- Yeah...

07:38.917 --> 07:40.168
My home wasn't exactly
a happy place back then.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.004
- Why not?

07:44.422 --> 07:47.926
- Well, my mom used
to make me promises.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.969
She couldn't keep 'em,

07:50.011 --> 07:51.680
and I got really upset.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.932
- What kind of promises?

07:53.973 --> 07:56.101
- Well, there used to be a fair

07:56.142 --> 07:58.978
that would come into town
every summer

07:59.020 --> 08:01.356
and they had one of those
really big roller coasters.

08:01.398 --> 08:04.734
And always wanted to ride it,
but I wasn't tall enough.

08:04.776 --> 08:07.153
So my mom, she got a pencil
and she went into my bedroom

08:07.195 --> 08:08.947
and she made a little mark
on the wall,

08:08.988 --> 08:12.033
the exact height that I needed
to be to ride it.

08:12.075 --> 08:15.036
And she promised me that
when I was tall enough,

08:15.078 --> 08:17.455
we would ride it together.

08:17.497 --> 08:21.042
So, every day, I would measure
myself against that mark

08:21.084 --> 08:23.003
until I was the right height.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.338
<i>But by that time,</i>

08:25.380 --> 08:27.674
she couldn't really get out
of bed anymore,

08:27.716 --> 08:30.760
not to mention ride
a roller coaster.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.888
So... I got pretty upset.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.975
I didn't understand why she
couldn't keep her promises

08:37.017 --> 08:39.852
and...I thought she didn't love
me enough.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.770
So I, uh, punched a hole
right through the wall

08:41.813 --> 08:42.981
where that pencil mark was.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.944
- You should've just breathed.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.988
Isn't that what you tell me
to do when I lose my temper?

08:52.782 --> 08:55.160
- (Chuckles)
Yeah, you're right. Right.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.286
That's what I should've done,

08:56.327 --> 08:59.039
but I didn't know that
back then.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.415
I also didn't really understand

09:00.457 --> 09:02.959
that the reason she didn't keep
her promise is because...

09:03.001 --> 09:06.379
she wasn't well,
she needed help,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.715
It had nothing to do with her
not loving me enough.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.512
You see that big wrench there?
- Oh, yeah.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.097
- Can you pass that to me?
- 'Kay.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.017
(Tools clatter)

09:21.394 --> 09:23.730
Hey...
- Hey.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.106
You are so good with him.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.486
Yeah, I-I came over earlier
to tell you something

09:29.527 --> 09:31.112
but I... I didn't wanna
interrupt.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.200
- Well, he had a tough day.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.993
I don't know if it made
a difference, but...

09:37.035 --> 09:39.788
- It did. Trust me, it did.

09:41.664 --> 09:46.127
- Thank you. So what'd you come
over to tell me?

09:46.169 --> 09:49.130
- Lee called about the well
for our new house.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.257
- Mm-hmm.
- And so far they have drilled

09:51.299 --> 09:53.093
in two locations.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.803
No water.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.100
- Okay. So what do they wanna
do now?

10:00.141 --> 10:01.893
- Drill in a third location,

10:01.935 --> 10:04.062
but the more they drill...
(Sighs heavily)

10:04.104 --> 10:05.730
- The bigger the bill.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.315
- Exactly.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.572
- What'd I tell you about that
contractor of yours?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.574
- This is not Lee's fault, Tim.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.035
- Well, he's the guy
responsible for hiring

10:19.077 --> 10:22.038
the sub-trades, isn't he?
- Yeah.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.498
- I'm sure this isn't the first
thing that's come in higher

10:23.540 --> 10:25.125
than his original quote.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.418
- We're building a house, Dad,
okay?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.795
Nobody expected it was gonna be
cheap.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.338
It's just really bad timing

10:30.380 --> 10:33.091
with everything going on
with Kirk right now.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.218
- Hey, I think we should tell
them about Sam Langston.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.095
- Uh, no, I don't think
we should.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.889
- They need the business, Jack.
- Okay, who's Sam?

10:39.931 --> 10:42.142
- He's the new owner of
Big River.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.102
- And...
- (Sighs)

10:44.144 --> 10:46.855
- He's interested in buying
one of the wild colts

10:46.896 --> 10:48.606
and hiring you to start it.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.443
- And I told him that those
horses are not for sale.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.945
- And I told him that
we'd discuss it.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.530
Because we all know that
there's not enough land

10:55.572 --> 10:57.490
<i>for that herd to grow</i>
<i>any bigger.</i>

10:57.532 --> 10:59.659
And because we feed them and
protect them from predators,

10:59.701 --> 11:02.162
there's no natural way
to control the population,

11:02.203 --> 11:03.705
keep it in check.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.210
- Come on, honey.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.467
- Hey, Kim,
Phoenix is recovering

11:15.508 --> 11:17.218
from vesicular stomatitis,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.429
so I really don't
wanna push him.

11:19.471 --> 11:22.640
Um, anyway, just, uh,
call me back. Thanks.

11:22.682 --> 11:26.394
(Phone beeps off) Hey! Dad!
- Hey, kiddo. (Chuckles)

11:26.436 --> 11:28.355
Oh, so this is the bachelorette
pad, huh?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.148
- Yeah. What're you doing here?

11:30.190 --> 11:31.483
I thought you weren't coming
till tomorrow.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.443
- I caught an earlier flight
so we can be at the open house

11:33.485 --> 11:35.445
first thing in the morning.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.989
- What open house?
- Mount Royal University.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.450
Turns out they are still
accepting applications.

11:40.492 --> 11:42.202
- (Sighs) Mom put you up
to this,

11:42.243 --> 11:43.912
didn't she?
- No...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.874
Yes, yes, of course she did.
(Laughs)

11:47.916 --> 11:49.501
- I knew it.
- Listen, in her defense,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.419
you've been dragging
your feet a little bit

11:51.461 --> 11:54.172
when it comes to making
decisions about school, right?

11:54.214 --> 11:55.465
Your mother and I just wanna
make sure you're aware

11:55.507 --> 11:57.258
of all your options,
sweetheart.

11:57.300 --> 11:58.968
- I don't have a choice, do I?

11:59.010 --> 12:01.346
- No. No, you don't.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.515
Tomorrow you will be a
prospective university student

12:03.556 --> 12:06.226
and I will be your loving
helicopter parent.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.519
It's gonna be great!

12:07.560 --> 12:09.187
Got any food in here?

12:10.689 --> 12:13.274
(Spring peepers peep)

12:15.610 --> 12:17.946
- (Chuckles)

12:17.987 --> 12:20.156
I can't sleep either.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.118
Too much pico de gallo
at dinner.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.286
<i>What's your excuse?</i>

12:25.328 --> 12:27.288
- The house. The well.

12:27.330 --> 12:28.790
Kirk's online posts.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.584
Losing all my clients.

12:31.626 --> 12:34.045
The quarantine.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.214
Plus, dinner was a little spicy.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.384
- Well, that's a lot of stuff
to carry around

12:39.426 --> 12:41.302
on your shoulders.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.304
It's a good thing you got
strong shoulders, huh.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.434
- Grandpa...

12:47.475 --> 12:50.979
what Dad said earlier about
re-homing some of the horses...

12:51.021 --> 12:52.564
he wasn't wrong.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.192
- I know. Starting a couple
of those colts

12:56.234 --> 12:58.236
probably does make sense, but...

13:00.155 --> 13:03.825
part of me feels like I'm
betraying Will in some way.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.077
- Will always did what was
right for the herd,

13:06.119 --> 13:08.538
even if that meant re-homing
a few of them.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.666
- That's true. Yeah,
he knew the personality

13:11.708 --> 13:14.586
of every single one
of those horses.

13:14.627 --> 13:18.256
- Yeah, but so do I, Grandpa.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.425
- There's nobody Will would
trust with his wildies

13:20.467 --> 13:22.802
more than you.

13:22.844 --> 13:24.971
If you wanna pick a couple
and see what you can do,

13:25.013 --> 13:26.097
then I won't stand in your way.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.265
(Floor creaks)

13:29.392 --> 13:32.312
Yeah, sounds like we're not
the only ones who can't sleep.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.606
Both: (Chuckle)

13:34.647 --> 13:38.151
- Thanks, Grandpa.
- (Sighs)

13:40.236 --> 13:41.363
(Door creaks open)

13:44.699 --> 13:46.242
- What're you looking for?

13:46.284 --> 13:48.244
- There's something on the roof.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.246
- It's probably just a squirrel.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.707
- Sounds a lot bigger to me.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.501
- Luke, why don't you hop back
into bed.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.795
- Do I have to?

13:56.836 --> 13:59.172
No matter what I do
I can't sleep.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.592
- Is this about what happened
with your mom today?

14:02.634 --> 14:05.136
- No, it's not that.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.347
It's this room.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.766
I mean, I'm-I'm really grateful
and everything, but--

14:09.808 --> 14:13.269
- You don't like it.
- No, I do. It's just...

14:13.311 --> 14:15.522
really dark up here at night

14:15.563 --> 14:17.065
and I'm pretty sure
there's something

14:17.107 --> 14:19.317
way bigger than a squirrel
on the roof.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.528
There's no way I'm gonna be
able to sleep tonight.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.071
- (Sighs)

14:24.280 --> 14:29.327
**

14:29.369 --> 14:31.538
(Thunder rumbles
in the distance)

14:33.415 --> 14:35.625
- I've noticed that this colt
seems curious about people.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.419
He's a little less fearful
of the human world

14:37.460 --> 14:39.087
than some of the others.

14:39.129 --> 14:41.297
- Not really what I had
in mind.

14:41.339 --> 14:42.632
- That's okay. I've got
a couple of others

14:42.674 --> 14:44.551
you can choose from.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.428
- Yeah? What about him?

14:48.263 --> 14:50.974
- (Sighs) I actually didn't
pick him on purpose.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.184
Every time I go out in the
field, he keeps his distance.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.311
And I know this sounds crazy,

14:55.353 --> 14:58.273
but some wild horses are
more wild than others.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.316
- But he's perfect.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.735
He looks exactly like a horse
I used to have

15:01.776 --> 15:03.570
when I was a kid.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.238
His name was Caz.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.450
- That horse over there
has a similar look.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.494
- Yeah, he's similar,
but not the same.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.705
Do you think you could try
with Caz?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.582
I'm happy to pay whatever
you're asking.

15:15.623 --> 15:18.168
- I don't know...

15:18.209 --> 15:20.378
- Look, I got a lot of friends
with horses.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.504
<i>I'd be happy to send them</i>
<i>your way</i>

15:21.546 --> 15:23.548
<i>if things work well with Caz.</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:25.383
What do you say?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.261
- I'll do my best.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.473
(Low hum of chatter)

15:32.682 --> 15:34.392
- Right?
- Yeah.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.437
- Okay...

15:37.479 --> 15:39.647
Hey, that could be you.

15:43.902 --> 15:46.279
(Low hum of chatter)

15:50.533 --> 15:52.619
<i>- It's right here.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.371
- Yeah.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.830
- Jen!
- Appreciate it.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.749
Hey, Peter!
- Hey.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.793
- Small world, huh?
- No, kidding!

15:59.834 --> 16:01.920
Uh, you're here
for the tour obviously?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.338
- Of course we are.
- (Laughs)

16:03.380 --> 16:04.714
Uh, Wyatt's around here
somewhere.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.175
<i>Wyatt!</i>

16:07.217 --> 16:08.593
- Wyatt's here.
- Yup.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.722
- You two have not seen each
other in a while, hey?

16:12.764 --> 16:15.433
- Yeah.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.018
- Wyatt!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.022
<i>Come over! Look who's here!</i>

16:23.149 --> 16:24.442
- Sorry.

16:26.361 --> 16:29.489
- Hey! How're you doing?
- Hey. Oh, good, thanks.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.449
- Well, this is... fun.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.035
<i>- Yeah!</i>

16:40.583 --> 16:42.377
- I heard a rumor you were back
in town.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.628
- Yeah. So how're you?

16:44.879 --> 16:46.339
- Pfff... never better.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.677
- Georgie! I didn't know you
were coming to this open house.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.679
- Hey! Yeah, uh, I didn't
either until yesterday.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.264
What're you doing here?
I thought you were going away

16:54.305 --> 16:55.849
for university.
- I am.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.767
Already got into my top three
schools:

16:57.809 --> 17:00.687
Carleton, Queens and Princeton.
I'm just here for moral support

17:00.729 --> 17:02.272
because Wyatt hasn't applied
anywhere.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.232
- Huh. Neither has Georgie.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.943
- (Chuckles, embarrassed)

17:06.984 --> 17:09.487
- This is great! The three
of us can tour campus.

17:09.529 --> 17:10.989
I-I mean, the five of us.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.991
- No, no, you were right
the first time.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.201
Uh, we don't need parental
escorts

17:15.242 --> 17:17.162
to tour the campus, right?

17:19.329 --> 17:21.415
Right, Mom?
- Uh, Peter, what do you think?

17:21.458 --> 17:22.625
Should we give them their
freedom?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.960
- Oh, I think they're all
young adults

17:24.002 --> 17:25.837
going off to College in
the fall.

17:25.878 --> 17:27.630
They should be able to handle
a tour on their own.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.591
- You sure you don't wanna stay?

17:29.632 --> 17:31.634
- Yeah, it's fine, sweetheart,
I don't wanna cramp your style.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.553
Go have fun, okay?
Just keep your phone on.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.013
- Okay.
- Bye, Mom.

17:35.055 --> 17:36.723
- Grab a coffee or...?
- Sure. Yup.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.558
- Have fun, guys.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.018
- I'm gonna sign us up
for a group tour

17:40.060 --> 17:41.811
before they fill up.
This is so great.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.646
The three amigos
back together again.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.898
Just like old times.

17:44.939 --> 17:47.317
- Yeah, yeah...

17:47.359 --> 17:49.319
just like old times.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.403
- Yeah...

17:53.406 --> 17:55.700
- Hey.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.161
So uh--

17:58.203 --> 18:00.872
Uh... Jack?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.791
- Hmm.
- Have you seen this?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.420
- What is that?

18:07.462 --> 18:09.381
<i>- (Laughs)</i>

18:09.422 --> 18:11.675
Did you know about it?

18:11.716 --> 18:13.593
- Well, Garland Foods,

18:13.635 --> 18:16.846
they sent a photographer out
a few months back, but...

18:16.888 --> 18:18.890
well, they took pictures
of Mitch and Tim too.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.601
I don't know why
I'm the only one in the ad.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.562
- 'Cause, well, it's wonderful,
that's why.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.980
Do you know how handsome
you are?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.649
(Screen door creaks)
- Hey.

18:27.691 --> 18:29.359
- Hey.
(Paper rustles)

18:29.401 --> 18:31.486
- Hi, Tim. I'm uh...

18:31.528 --> 18:33.488
I'm making a sandwich.

18:33.530 --> 18:35.907
Would you like a sandwich?

18:35.949 --> 18:39.369
- No. No, I'll pass.
I had breakfast.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.329
Is-is that today's paper?

18:41.371 --> 18:42.872
- Yes.
- Uh, no,

18:42.914 --> 18:46.334
it is not today's paper.
This is yesterday's paper.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.752
There is no today's paper.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.755
- Come on! That's silly.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.632
He's gonna see the ad
eventually.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.175
- What ad? What're you talking
about?

18:57.095 --> 18:59.931
What? Garland sent
a photographer

18:59.973 --> 19:01.850
to take pictures of
the three of us.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.810
- I know.
- That's just you.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.311
- I know!
- Well, why are you

19:05.353 --> 19:06.980
the only face in that ad?

19:07.022 --> 19:09.441
- I have no idea.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.317
- 'Cause it's a really great
picture.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.739
(Caz grunts)

19:15.780 --> 19:17.532
- (Whistles)

19:20.827 --> 19:22.620
(Hooves thud heavily)

19:22.662 --> 19:25.707
(Lasso whooshes)

19:25.749 --> 19:27.208
(Caz grunts nervously)

19:29.586 --> 19:32.464
(Grunts nervously,
hooves thud heavily)

19:38.011 --> 19:39.804
Come on!
(Caz grunts nervously)

19:41.014 --> 19:44.225
(Lasso whooshes)

19:45.477 --> 19:55.820
**

19:55.862 --> 19:56.863
You're okay...

19:59.157 --> 20:01.618
(Caz whinnies nervously)
Hey!

20:01.659 --> 20:02.911
Ugh!

20:04.788 --> 20:06.373
(Caz grunts nervously)

20:06.414 --> 20:08.249
- (Sighs heavily)

20:12.420 --> 20:15.256
(Chatter)

20:17.759 --> 20:20.679
- Look, uh... I know that
the last time we talked

20:20.720 --> 20:23.932
things were kind of... intense.
- Intense?

20:23.973 --> 20:25.475
- Yeah, like I think that
we probably both said

20:25.517 --> 20:27.727
some things that we regret.

20:27.769 --> 20:30.063
- I seem to remember pouring
my heart out to you

20:30.105 --> 20:31.898
and then never hearing
from you again.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.149
- Well, you left.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.193
- You could've called
or texted.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.611
- Well, that seems kind of
impersonal.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.780
- More impersonal than not
talking at all?

20:41.241 --> 20:44.994
Anyway, it's probably
for the best.

20:45.036 --> 20:46.204
When I didn't hear from you,

20:46.246 --> 20:49.499
I decided that it was time
to move on,

20:49.541 --> 20:51.292
so I did... move on.

20:52.961 --> 20:54.754
- Oh, that's good
because so did I.

20:55.964 --> 20:59.050
- Good.

20:59.092 --> 21:02.012
- Bad news. All tour groups are
full until this afternoon.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.597
- Well, I say we just take
the self-guided tour.

21:04.639 --> 21:06.891
- There are no self-guided
tours.

21:06.933 --> 21:09.019
That's not a thing.
You just made that up.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.520
- Dude, there's no way that
I'm standing around waiting

21:10.562 --> 21:12.313
for some college freshman
to come tell me

21:12.355 --> 21:14.566
how dope the cafeteria salad
bar is. We've got a map,

21:14.607 --> 21:15.775
we'll just follow it.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.738
- Georgie, tell him
we're not doing this.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.740
- Honestly, I'm all for getting
this thing over with.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.825
Let's just go.
- Are you coming or not?

21:28.872 --> 21:32.042
- Great. Thank you. Bye.
(Phone beeps off)

21:32.083 --> 21:34.461
Jack, you're never gonna guess
who that was.

21:34.502 --> 21:36.296
- Mm-hmm?

21:36.338 --> 21:38.590
- That was somebody from PR
department at Garland Foods.

21:38.631 --> 21:41.051
Apparently, this ad is getting
a big reaction

21:41.092 --> 21:43.845
and now a Calgary radio station
would like to interview you.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.222
- Well, I'm playing a game
of chess here.

21:46.264 --> 21:47.932
Besides, I don't like all
the fuss.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.100
I think I'll pass
on that interview.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.227
- But... wait.

21:51.269 --> 21:53.646
This could be a really good
opportunity for you

21:53.688 --> 21:56.649
to educate people on ranching
in this province,

21:56.691 --> 21:59.194
not to mention free advertising
for Heartland beef.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.863
So would you consider it
at least?

22:04.074 --> 22:05.492
- What are you, his agent now?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.494
- What're uh... (Sighs)

22:07.535 --> 22:08.703
- (Sighs)

22:11.539 --> 22:14.709
(Door bangs shut)

22:23.259 --> 22:25.929
Fred, it's Tim Fleming.
Call me back, please.

22:25.970 --> 22:27.180
(Clears throat)

22:27.222 --> 22:30.517
There's something we need
to discuss.

22:30.558 --> 22:31.559
(Phone beeps off)

22:36.773 --> 22:38.149
- So from here,
I think we should hit

22:38.191 --> 22:40.068
the faculty of science
and technology

22:40.110 --> 22:41.820
and then the Student Union--
- When you say "moved on,"

22:41.861 --> 22:43.738
does that mean
what I think it means?

22:43.780 --> 22:45.865
- What do you think it means?
- Actually, it makes more sense

22:45.907 --> 22:47.325
to do the faculty
of agriculture

22:47.367 --> 22:49.786
and then the Student Union
buildings.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.204
- God, there's gotta be
something

22:51.246 --> 22:52.956
remotely interesting
to see here.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.374
That comprehensive tour
of the Nursing building

22:54.416 --> 22:55.959
you just took us on
was a huge snooze-fest.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.836
No offence.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.213
- I thought that model of the
lower bowel was fascinating.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.007
Don't you think, Georgie?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.883
- So far, it's been
the highlight of my day.

23:03.925 --> 23:05.927
- Mm-hmm.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.762
(Hard tap) I know what
we're doing. Follow me.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.807
(Caz grunts)

23:10.849 --> 23:12.934
(Amy clucks her tongue)

23:12.976 --> 23:14.477
(Whistles)

23:14.519 --> 23:17.063
(Caz grunts)

23:17.105 --> 23:18.815
<i>- Well, it looks like you're</i>
<i>making progress.</i>

23:18.857 --> 23:20.734
- A little.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.902
Hey, Sam, are you sure
that you won't consider

23:22.944 --> 23:24.863
one of the other colts?

23:24.904 --> 23:26.239
- He giving you trouble?

23:26.281 --> 23:28.825
- No. Every time I make
some progress,

23:28.867 --> 23:32.120
I just feel like I'm breaking
his spirit.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.748
- Well, isn't gentling a horse
the same as breaking 'em?

23:34.789 --> 23:36.958
- No, that's not how I work.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.710
Gentling a horse should be
about gaining his trust,

23:38.752 --> 23:40.837
not breaking him down.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.964
- Okay, so then...
get him to trust you.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.299
- (Sighs) I'm pretty sure
that Caz

23:44.341 --> 23:47.135
just wants to be left alone.

23:47.177 --> 23:49.137
- He's a wild horse. Of course,
that's what he wants.

23:49.179 --> 23:51.181
- Caz isn't like the other
wild horses.

23:51.222 --> 23:52.265
There's something about him.

23:52.307 --> 23:54.976
Something that I can't quite
put my finger on.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.186
- You're saying you have some
sort of

23:56.227 --> 23:58.146
a sentimental attachment
to him, is that it?

23:58.188 --> 23:59.939
- What I'm saying is there's
three other horses

23:59.981 --> 24:01.649
that are more suited
to being gentled.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.693
- Yeah, but they're not Caz.

24:03.735 --> 24:06.279
So we're back to where
we started.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.782
Maybe we should just forget
this whole thing.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.241
- (Sighs)

24:10.283 --> 24:13.119
No... no, I'll...

24:13.161 --> 24:14.913
I'll keep trying.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.414
I'm just gonna need more time.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.751
- All right, take all the time
you need.

24:19.793 --> 24:22.003
And that number we discussed,

24:22.045 --> 24:23.254
double it.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.673
For your trouble.

24:29.678 --> 24:31.721
- Hey!
- Hey.

24:31.763 --> 24:33.473
- Did you tell Luke that
he could stay in our room?

24:33.515 --> 24:36.351
- Of course not.
- Well, he said that you did.

24:36.393 --> 24:38.144
- (Sighs) Hey, Luke, um...

24:39.813 --> 24:41.981
what're you doing
with that stuff?

24:42.023 --> 24:44.234
- I'll sleep better if I have
a few of my things down here.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.694
- Yeah, but you know that
last night

24:45.735 --> 24:48.196
was just temporary, right?

24:48.238 --> 24:51.491
- I know. I promise to move
back as soon as I'm ready.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.288
- Amy, he can't stay
in our room.

24:57.330 --> 24:58.832
- I know.

24:58.873 --> 25:00.458
- The whole point of us moving
into the house

25:00.500 --> 25:01.918
was so that he could have
his own space.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.837
- I know. Maybe you can talk
to him.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.755
- Why me?
- Because he likes you more

25:05.797 --> 25:07.882
than he likes me.
You guys have a connection.

25:07.924 --> 25:09.467
Look how well you handled him
yesterday

25:09.509 --> 25:11.761
when his mom canceled.
And besides, Ty,

25:11.803 --> 25:13.763
I really have to get out
and work with that colt.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.348
We can't afford to lose
another client.

25:15.390 --> 25:17.600
Thanks for lunch.

25:17.642 --> 25:18.727
- Yeah.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.272
- Just to be clear,
when I said I moved on,

25:22.313 --> 25:23.940
I meant I've been seeing
other people.

25:23.982 --> 25:26.317
- That's what I meant too.
- Good.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.736
- Good.
- Glad we cleared that up.

25:29.821 --> 25:32.073
- Can we focus here?

25:32.115 --> 25:33.867
Considering neither of you have
made a decision

25:33.908 --> 25:35.535
about where you're going
to school in the fall,

25:35.577 --> 25:37.328
I figured we might take this
more seriously.

25:37.370 --> 25:38.371
- Yeah, actually,
I agree with Adam.

25:38.413 --> 25:40.874
I think that we should
take it more seriously

25:40.915 --> 25:42.250
because how are we gonna make
an informed decision about this

25:42.292 --> 25:43.793
when we haven't experienced
everything

25:43.835 --> 25:46.254
that it has to offer.
- Exactly.

25:46.296 --> 25:49.758
- Which is why we need to
experience this climbing wall.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.010
- What? No, we don't have time
for that.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.470
- Fine, suit yourself.

25:53.511 --> 25:55.096
Meet me in the quad
when I'm done.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.600
- Come on, Georgie,

25:58.641 --> 26:00.268
there's this really cool
robotic arm we can check out

26:00.310 --> 26:02.103
in the science and technology
building.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.856
- Actually, climbing looks
pretty fun.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.275
- More fun than a robotic arm?

26:09.569 --> 26:11.112
- Get that taken out and
I think--

26:11.154 --> 26:12.697
- Oh, Fred!

26:12.739 --> 26:14.491
- Tim! Hey!
- Hey.

26:14.532 --> 26:15.909
Hey, what brings you
to Calgary?

26:15.950 --> 26:17.827
- Hi. Well, I left you
a message.

26:17.869 --> 26:19.287
You never got back to me, so...

26:19.329 --> 26:20.538
I figured I'd drive into
the city.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.165
You're a busy guy, you know?
- Huh.

26:22.207 --> 26:25.043
- Anyway, I'll get right
to the point.

26:25.085 --> 26:27.212
I wondered why Mitch and I were
excluded from this ad.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.339
- Well, we hired a focus group

26:29.381 --> 26:30.882
to give us feedback on
the images

26:30.924 --> 26:32.342
and this is the one
that received

26:32.384 --> 26:33.551
the most favourable result.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.387
- W-what is it about Jack
they like?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.097
- Well, I think most people
agreed

26:37.138 --> 26:39.349
that he had an honest,
friendly face.

26:39.391 --> 26:42.185
- Oh. And why didn't they pick
Mitch?

26:42.227 --> 26:43.978
- (Chuckles) Well, he scored
high with the female members

26:44.020 --> 26:45.480
of the focus group, but...

26:45.522 --> 26:47.899
he doesn't have the broad
appeal of Jack.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.484
- Yeah? What about me?

26:49.526 --> 26:51.319
- (Sighs and chuckles)

26:54.155 --> 26:57.117
Well, you know, Tim,
it's all very technical

26:57.158 --> 26:59.244
and I don't know the specifics.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.663
- I'd like to see the results
of that focus group.

27:01.705 --> 27:04.916
- Uh, look, I-I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.876
- Well, Fred,
you're always saying

27:06.918 --> 27:09.129
that Garland Foods
is a family business,

27:09.170 --> 27:11.339
right?
- Yeah...

27:11.381 --> 27:12.924
- I kinda feel like Heartland's
a part of the family,

27:12.966 --> 27:15.010
wouldn't you say?
- Absolutely.

27:15.051 --> 27:18.096
- Well, you don't keep secrets
from family.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.682
- Okay, you win.

27:20.724 --> 27:23.184
I will have my assistant
forward you the report.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.485
- So what's the dating scene
like in Switzerland?

27:32.527 --> 27:36.197
Is it mostly eating fondu and
shopping for expensive watches?

27:36.239 --> 27:39.200
- Hey, guys? Did I mention
I'm afraid of heights?

27:39.242 --> 27:41.286
- So how many dates are we
talking, like one or two,

27:41.327 --> 27:43.496
or did you really go for it?
- None of your business.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.248
- Well, it's none of your
business how many dates

27:45.290 --> 27:47.667
I went on.
- Well, I didn't ask.

27:47.709 --> 27:49.419
- Hey, guys?
- Well, the answer's a lot.

27:49.461 --> 27:51.129
Like... a lot of,
a lot of dates.

27:51.171 --> 27:52.505
Like more than I can even count.

27:52.547 --> 27:55.050
- (Huffs) Good for you.

27:55.091 --> 27:58.511
- Ahhh! Ungh! Ungh!
- Whoa, Adam, whoa.

27:58.553 --> 28:00.638
- That's it!
I can't take this anymore.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.223
- Whoa, dude,
what's your problem?

28:02.265 --> 28:04.017
- You! You are my problem!

28:04.059 --> 28:05.435
You too, Georgie.

28:05.477 --> 28:07.854
- Me? What did I do?

28:07.896 --> 28:11.107
- You both talk big game
about moving on,

28:11.149 --> 28:13.276
but none of you are acting
like it!

28:13.318 --> 28:14.944
I know for a fact

28:14.986 --> 28:16.529
Wyatt has been on a sum total
of one date.

28:16.571 --> 28:18.239
It lasted all of 15 minutes

28:18.281 --> 28:20.867
before he forced me to call him
with a fake emergency.

28:20.909 --> 28:22.660
- Really? Is that true?

28:22.702 --> 28:25.246
- Yeah, it's true. She kept
pronouncing the j in jalapeno.

28:25.288 --> 28:26.998
Who does that?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.417
- Aren't the two of you tired
of all the drama?

28:29.459 --> 28:31.544
Can't the three of us just
be friends?

28:31.586 --> 28:33.755
Would that be so crazy?

28:42.055 --> 28:43.098
Down!

28:44.307 --> 28:45.725
(Caz grunts)

28:50.605 --> 28:52.232
(Caz grunts nervously)
- Agh! Ugh! (Gate clangs)

28:55.527 --> 28:56.778
Caz?

28:58.571 --> 29:00.073
Come on, Caz.

29:02.701 --> 29:06.454
Get up!
(Clucks her tongue)

29:06.496 --> 29:07.872
(Caz grunts nervously)

29:07.914 --> 29:09.082
Come on!

29:12.460 --> 29:14.129
Get up! Get up!

29:15.547 --> 29:16.965
(Sucks teeth)

29:18.508 --> 29:21.136
(Clucks tongue, Caz whinnies)
Ha! Ha!

29:22.512 --> 29:23.805
(Whinnies)

29:23.847 --> 29:26.016
Come on...

29:26.057 --> 29:28.309
(Heavy thump, Caz whinnies)

29:28.351 --> 29:36.234
**

29:36.276 --> 29:38.111
(Caz breathes heavily)

29:38.153 --> 29:39.779
- (Calming exhales)

29:40.905 --> 29:48.413
**

29:48.455 --> 29:51.041
(Curious snorts)

29:51.082 --> 29:56.129
**

29:56.171 --> 29:57.922
(Caz grunts)

30:00.383 --> 30:02.302
(Low hum of chatter)

30:02.344 --> 30:03.470
- Ah, large coffee.
- Thanks.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.349
- Hey.

30:11.394 --> 30:12.645
So...

30:12.687 --> 30:15.523
I should've called you.

30:15.565 --> 30:18.401
Instead,
I completely avoided you,

30:18.443 --> 30:20.820
which I now realize made things
a whole lot worse.

30:23.531 --> 30:25.492
And I know that it's...

30:25.533 --> 30:27.077
probably, probably too late
for this,

30:27.118 --> 30:29.537
but for whatever it's worth,

30:29.579 --> 30:31.164
I'm sorry.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.086
Do you think that there's
maybe any way

30:36.127 --> 30:38.004
that we could get past this?

30:41.091 --> 30:42.384
- Friends?

30:45.178 --> 30:46.846
- Friends.
- (Chuckles)

30:50.225 --> 30:52.477
- Wait, what just happened?
- Um...

30:52.519 --> 30:55.730
I think that we just came
to our senses finally.

30:55.772 --> 30:57.649
- Listen, I'm really sorry

30:57.691 --> 30:59.776
if we made you feel like
a third wheel all day.

30:59.818 --> 31:01.277
That was really unfair.
- Mm-hmm.

31:01.319 --> 31:03.113
- That's okay.

31:03.154 --> 31:05.198
I'm just glad the three amigos
are back together.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.325
Hasn't been the same
since you left.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.035
- Looks like we're gonna be
seeing a lot of each other

31:09.077 --> 31:10.620
if we both go here.

31:10.662 --> 31:12.163
- Actually, I'm not applying
here.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.832
- Why?
- Well...

31:13.873 --> 31:15.375
I haven't broken the news
to my mom yet,

31:15.417 --> 31:17.335
but I'm taking the year off.
I'm travelling.

31:17.377 --> 31:19.212
- So that road trip you were
talking about,

31:19.254 --> 31:21.339
that's really happening.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.591
Yeah, I'm leaving the day
after grad.

31:23.633 --> 31:25.343
And Adam's actually coming
with me the first few weeks

31:25.385 --> 31:27.303
before he heads off to school.
- We knew you'd be busy

31:27.345 --> 31:29.472
with horse shows all summer,

31:29.514 --> 31:31.558
otherwise we'd ask you
to come with us.

31:31.599 --> 31:41.317
**

31:41.359 --> 31:49.909
**

31:56.624 --> 31:58.335
- I gotta head
to Larsson's Dairy farm.

31:58.376 --> 32:00.211
One of their cows is having
problems calving.

32:00.253 --> 32:02.172
- Um... have you had a chance
to talk to Luke

32:02.213 --> 32:04.841
about his sleeping
arrangements?

32:04.883 --> 32:07.093
- No, you're gonna have to do
that, Amy.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.012
- (Sighs)

32:09.054 --> 32:11.097
- Look, I know you said you're
not good at dealing with Luke,

32:11.139 --> 32:12.974
but you're wrong.

32:13.016 --> 32:15.226
- When something's bugging him,
he wants you, not me.

32:15.268 --> 32:17.312
Even Lyndy wants you
when she wakes up from a nap.

32:17.354 --> 32:19.689
Seriously, I am chopped liver.
- You know that's just a phase.

32:19.731 --> 32:22.609
- Yeah, but it's not Lyndy
that I'm worried about.

32:22.650 --> 32:25.612
- Talk to Luke.
- I don't know what to say.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.822
- Trust your instincts.

32:27.864 --> 32:30.617
You're better at this
than you think.

32:30.658 --> 32:32.118
I love you.
- I love you too.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.453
- See ya.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.250
(Snorts softly)
- Good boy.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.672
Hey.
- Hey...

32:45.924 --> 32:48.718
So... that was not the way
I wanted you to find out

32:48.760 --> 32:50.595
about me and Jen.

32:50.637 --> 32:53.765
- Dad, it's okay.
You don't have to explain.

32:53.807 --> 32:55.684
Mom moved on with Mitch,

32:55.725 --> 32:58.687
and you deserve to be happy
too.

32:58.728 --> 33:02.190
- Thank you. Thank you for
being so mature about it.

33:02.232 --> 33:05.568
Really. Um, you know,
and the truth is,

33:05.610 --> 33:08.363
Jen and I haven't even really
defined what it is we're--

33:08.405 --> 33:10.365
- Dad? You know, I think this
is one of those situations

33:10.407 --> 33:13.535
where less information
is really more.

33:13.576 --> 33:16.496
- Yes, right, okay. Great.

33:16.538 --> 33:18.581
Yeah, um...

33:18.623 --> 33:20.291
How did the campus tour go?

33:20.333 --> 33:23.211
- Uh, it was good. Yeah, fun.

33:23.253 --> 33:25.880
And no, I still haven't made
a decision

33:25.922 --> 33:28.675
about university yet.

33:28.717 --> 33:31.261
But I have been thinking
about summer.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.554
- Okay.

33:34.931 --> 33:36.725
- I need a break
from showjumping.

33:38.309 --> 33:41.396
I need one and Phoenix
needs one.

33:41.438 --> 33:44.691
I'm not quitting,
I'm just pressing pause.

33:44.733 --> 33:48.862
- Okay. What does your coach
think about this?

33:48.903 --> 33:51.823
- Well, Kim, she says
she respects my decision,

33:51.865 --> 33:54.492
but she can't be
my trainer anymore.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.870
- Really. That's a little
harsh. Wow.

33:56.911 --> 33:58.830
Do you want me to talk to her?
- No, it's okay,

33:58.872 --> 34:00.790
'cause really, there's so much
more to life

34:00.832 --> 34:02.751
than training and competing.

34:04.252 --> 34:06.004
- Okay.

34:06.046 --> 34:08.505
Well, it sounds like you've
thought about this a lot.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.175
- I have. Can you not...

34:11.717 --> 34:14.012
tell Mom just until
she gets back?

34:14.054 --> 34:16.431
I wanna tell her in person.
- Yeah, no, of course.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.600
I won't. I won't say a word.

34:18.641 --> 34:20.476
You should be the one to tell
her about your...

34:20.518 --> 34:21.770
your summer plans and um...

34:23.438 --> 34:24.856
you know, I should be the one
to tell her...

34:24.898 --> 34:26.524
about Jen.

34:26.565 --> 34:28.525
- Right. Deal.
- Deal.

34:28.568 --> 34:30.570
(Laughs)

34:35.742 --> 34:37.911
- Did you brush your teeth?
- Yup.

34:37.952 --> 34:40.288
- Good.

34:40.330 --> 34:42.748
Hey, Luke, listen.

34:42.791 --> 34:45.043
I know what it's like to be
afraid when you're alone.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.253
- What do you mean?
- Well...

34:49.297 --> 34:51.800
after I lost my mom,

34:51.841 --> 34:53.677
it was lonely

34:53.717 --> 34:55.428
and I had trouble sleeping.

34:56.763 --> 34:58.473
- I didn't lose my mom.

34:58.515 --> 35:00.350
She's coming back.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.435
- I know she's coming back.
It's just...

35:02.477 --> 35:05.730
sometimes when you're lonely,
the dark can be scary.

35:05.772 --> 35:07.565
- I'm not afraid of the dark.

35:07.607 --> 35:09.776
I'm not a little kid.

35:09.818 --> 35:11.903
- Well, Luke, last night, you--

35:11.945 --> 35:14.030
- If you don't want me to sleep
in your room, just say it.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.990
- No, I'm just trying
to help you.

35:16.032 --> 35:18.284
- Well, I don't need your help,
so just leave me alone!

35:19.953 --> 35:21.496
- (Sighs)

35:24.582 --> 35:26.334
(Remi pants)

35:28.753 --> 35:29.838
(Spring peepers peep)

35:34.050 --> 35:36.177
(Remi's nails clip)

35:39.889 --> 35:42.434
- I miss my mom.

35:42.475 --> 35:44.019
- I know you do.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.895
- When I lived with her,

35:45.937 --> 35:47.313
we were always in the same room
together.

35:49.399 --> 35:53.028
And then when I moved into
the loft,

35:53.069 --> 35:55.655
it was pretty much one
big room, so...

35:55.697 --> 35:57.866
- So you've never had a bedroom
of your own before?

35:59.784 --> 36:01.619
- Hey, Luke, you...

36:01.661 --> 36:03.163
you don't have to sleep up here
if you don't want to.

36:04.873 --> 36:07.042
But what do you think about
Remi hanging out with you

36:07.083 --> 36:08.668
for a little while?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.882
- What do you mean?
- (Whistles) Come here.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.801
Come on.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.803
You see, when I was your age,

36:18.845 --> 36:21.556
I always had a dog sleep
in my room.

36:21.598 --> 36:23.433
The cool thing about animals is
they can always sense

36:23.475 --> 36:25.018
when there's danger.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.854
So anytime I was frightened,
I just looked at my dog

36:27.896 --> 36:31.358
and if she was calm, I knew
that everything was okay.

36:32.942 --> 36:34.486
So what do you say?

36:34.527 --> 36:35.904
Can she hang out with you
tonight?

36:38.031 --> 36:39.866
- What about Georgie?

36:39.908 --> 36:42.118
Won't she be lonely
without her?

36:42.160 --> 36:44.412
- I think Georgie will be okay.

36:45.955 --> 36:48.583
And you remember that
your sleeping bag

36:48.625 --> 36:50.251
is always in our room
if you need it.

36:51.961 --> 36:53.296
- Good night.

36:53.338 --> 36:56.007
- Amy?

36:56.049 --> 36:58.426
I'm sorry that I got mad
at you.

36:58.468 --> 37:00.845
- It's okay, Luke.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.931
You have a good sleep.

37:02.972 --> 37:04.933
(Door creaks shut,
Remi pants)

37:07.352 --> 37:13.733
**

37:13.775 --> 37:15.443
* Tell my mother *

37:17.654 --> 37:25.370
**

37:25.412 --> 37:28.456
* So hard *

37:28.498 --> 37:31.751
* To be alone *

37:31.793 --> 37:32.961
* Those days *

37:34.421 --> 37:36.756
(Gate rattles)

* So hard *

37:46.641 --> 37:48.435
* Those days *

37:52.897 --> 37:54.607
- (Sighs)

37:56.067 --> 37:57.777
(Horses whinny)

38:04.784 --> 38:06.327
- What do you got there?

38:07.912 --> 38:10.331
- Fred sent me a focus group
report on our photos.

38:12.167 --> 38:13.668
- Why would Fred send you that?

38:13.710 --> 38:15.712
- 'Cause I asked him to.

38:15.754 --> 38:16.921
Do you wanna know
what it says about you?

38:16.963 --> 38:19.007
- No.

38:19.049 --> 38:22.594
- Well, you'll be happy to know
that you have a friendly face

38:22.635 --> 38:24.846
and were described
with words like "wise",

38:24.888 --> 38:26.514
"intelligent" and "iconic".

38:28.016 --> 38:30.143
<i>Mitch, on the other hand,</i>
<i>was described</i>

38:30.185 --> 38:32.771
as "a model dressed
as a cowboy.

38:32.812 --> 38:35.190
Should be on the cover
of a romance novel."

38:35.231 --> 38:37.067
- Well... (Laughs)

38:37.108 --> 38:39.903
- Know what it says about me?
- No.

38:39.944 --> 38:41.821
- "Does not have a trustworthy
face."

38:44.532 --> 38:46.284
That's what it said.

38:46.326 --> 38:48.661
- Well, who cares?
- I care.

38:48.703 --> 38:50.955
You're iconic,
I'm a used car salesman.

38:50.997 --> 38:52.707
- You know, at one time,

38:52.749 --> 38:55.960
I might've agreed that
you're not trustworthy.

38:56.002 --> 38:58.129
But over the years
you've proved otherwise

38:58.171 --> 39:01.091
to the people who actually
matter in your life:

39:01.132 --> 39:03.218
your family.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.470
So forget the report,

39:05.512 --> 39:06.721
move on.

39:08.598 --> 39:10.225
- You know, I'm not buying

39:10.266 --> 39:11.976
that you're not enjoying this
a little.

39:12.018 --> 39:13.520
- Look, you're referring
to the fact

39:13.561 --> 39:15.814
that my picture's
in the paper and...

39:15.855 --> 39:17.899
total strangers describe me
as...

39:19.234 --> 39:20.902
wise, intelligent, iconic,

39:22.612 --> 39:24.406
not to mention drop dead
handsome,

39:24.447 --> 39:26.199
then no...

39:26.241 --> 39:28.076
I'm not enjoying it at all.

39:31.079 --> 39:32.747
- (Amused sigh)

39:34.749 --> 39:36.292
<i>- Well, I'm not gonna lie.</i>
<i>I am disappointed,</i>

39:36.334 --> 39:38.545
but I think I understand.

39:38.586 --> 39:40.755
- You do?

39:40.797 --> 39:43.049
- You saw something in that
horse.

39:43.091 --> 39:46.678
Something most people
can't see, including me.

39:46.720 --> 39:49.806
And whatever Caz's future holds,

39:49.848 --> 39:51.850
it won't be hauling my sorry
butt around.

39:51.891 --> 39:53.435
- Well, if you ever change
your mind

39:53.476 --> 39:55.520
about one of those other colts,
you know where to find me.

39:55.562 --> 39:57.272
- Yeah, I do.

39:57.313 --> 39:59.649
I better get going.
You have yourself a good day.

39:59.691 --> 40:02.610
- Yeah, you too.

40:02.652 --> 40:04.362
- You did the right thing.

40:04.404 --> 40:06.948
- For Caz. I don't know if it
was the right thing for us.

40:06.990 --> 40:08.742
- You listening to your gut
is the right thing for us.

40:08.783 --> 40:10.744
I learned that the hard way
with Kirk's horse.

40:10.785 --> 40:13.121
- Ty, I mean, how are we gonna
afford the well?

40:13.163 --> 40:15.290
We're barely breaking even
with all the house expenses.

40:15.331 --> 40:16.916
- All we need is some
short-term cash

40:16.958 --> 40:18.877
until business picks up again,
okay?

40:18.918 --> 40:20.962
So... we'll just sell something.

40:22.172 --> 40:24.341
- Like what?

40:24.382 --> 40:27.135
- Uh... I could sell my old
blue truck?

40:27.177 --> 40:29.804
- No, no, we can't.
I love that truck.

40:29.846 --> 40:32.015
There's too many good memories
in there.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.141
- Okay, uh...

40:35.226 --> 40:37.145
I have another idea.

40:39.647 --> 40:44.778
**

40:44.819 --> 40:46.780
- Thanks.

40:46.821 --> 40:49.824
- See ya.

40:49.866 --> 40:51.701
- Are you sure about this?
(Engine starts)

40:51.743 --> 40:54.287
- I am, yup.

40:54.329 --> 40:55.747
You know, I was saying
to Luke the other day

40:55.789 --> 40:57.707
that when I was a kid,

40:57.749 --> 40:59.250
I used to dream about having
a motorcycle

40:59.292 --> 41:01.294
so I could get as far away
from my life as possible.

41:01.336 --> 41:03.922
But I'm not running away
anymore.

41:03.963 --> 41:06.174
- (Chuckles)
Still, you must be...

41:06.216 --> 41:08.051
a little sad to see it go.

41:08.093 --> 41:09.302
- (Chuckles)

41:09.344 --> 41:10.929
(Truck rumbles)

41:12.347 --> 41:14.766
- Yeah, maybe a little.
- (Chuckles)

41:16.768 --> 41:19.104
- So what do you think of...

41:19.145 --> 41:20.939
your mom and my dad--

41:20.980 --> 41:23.108
- Oh no, don't finish that
sentence, please.

41:23.149 --> 41:25.193
I had a truly awkward
conversation

41:25.235 --> 41:26.903
with my mom this morning.
- Ooh.

41:26.945 --> 41:28.697
- Yeah, I'm gonna need a lot
of therapy, I think.

41:28.738 --> 41:30.073
- Let's talk about something
else then.

41:30.115 --> 41:31.950
- Yes, yes, please.

41:31.991 --> 41:33.993
- So that road trip you were
talking about going on

41:34.035 --> 41:36.037
with, uh, Adam?
- Mm-hmm.

41:36.079 --> 41:38.039
What about it?

41:38.081 --> 41:41.835
- Do you think you might
have room for me?

41:41.876 --> 41:44.963
- Seriously? What about all
the horse shows and everything?

41:45.005 --> 41:47.382
- I'm taking a break.

41:47.424 --> 41:48.883
So what do you think?

41:50.427 --> 41:52.679
- Yeah, I-I think uh... yeah.

41:54.389 --> 41:56.391
Yeah, this is gonna be a really
fun road trip, I think.

41:56.433 --> 41:59.185
- Okay, good. It'll be good.

41:59.227 --> 42:00.812
- Yeah.

42:00.854 --> 42:04.524
* Anywhere you're laughing *

42:07.402 --> 42:11.156
* And those eyes are dancing *

42:12.866 --> 42:15.410
* Shining right here *

42:15.452 --> 42:18.246
* In my heart *

42:18.288 --> 42:21.541
* Home is where you are *

42:23.835 --> 42:26.588
* Anywhere there's music *

42:31.009 --> 42:34.262
- Hey. Grandpa and Lisa are
gonna watch the kids tonight.

42:34.304 --> 42:35.722
I've got a surprise for you.

42:35.764 --> 42:37.098
* I will never *

42:38.350 --> 42:41.102
* Be too far *

42:41.144 --> 42:45.023
* Home is where you are *

42:45.065 --> 42:47.192
Do you remember when
you built me that swing

42:47.233 --> 42:50.070
and we dreamed about what our
house would be like one day?

42:50.111 --> 42:51.696
- Yeah, I remember.
- (Laughs)

42:51.738 --> 42:55.158
Well, that dream is coming true.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.868
And I know it's just a
foundation right now,

42:56.910 --> 42:58.995
but someday...

42:59.037 --> 43:01.664
this'll be our home.

43:01.706 --> 43:04.042
And yeah, "someday"

43:04.084 --> 43:07.045
seems pretty far away right now,

43:07.087 --> 43:10.048
especially with everything
that's going on, but...

43:10.090 --> 43:11.758
we'll get there,

43:11.800 --> 43:13.301
I know we will,

43:13.343 --> 43:14.803
and it'll be all worth it.

43:16.179 --> 43:19.140
* Where you are *

43:21.059 --> 43:23.144
* Like a Northern star *

43:24.354 --> 43:27.691
* Home is where you are *

43:27.732 --> 43:32.821
**
