03:19.950 --> 03:22.169
Clara!

03:22.244 --> 03:23.416
Hector.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.214
- Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.

03:26.289 --> 03:29.338
Time to rise, time to shine.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.635
Mm.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.425
<i>Once upon</i> a <i>time,</i>

03:37.509 --> 03:40.809
<i>there was a young psychiatrist
called Hector,</i>

03:40.887 --> 03:44.767
<i>who had a very satisfactory life.</i>

03:44.850 --> 03:47.569
<i>His world was tidy,</i>

03:47.644 --> 03:49.191
<i>uncomplicated...</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:53.779
<i>And he liked it that way.</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:02.618
<i>He took great comfort
in its predictable patterns.</i>

04:06.163 --> 04:08.837
<i>Patterns his girlfriend Clara
was happy to maintain.</i>

04:15.505 --> 04:16.505
Thank you.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.387
Bye.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.476
Oh!

04:20.552 --> 04:22.600
<i>Any lapse
was swiftly rectified.</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:01.848
<i>Hector had a great deal
of patience</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:04.646
<i>for his patients,
if you see what I</i> mean.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.144
Every day, I ask myself,

05:07.224 --> 05:10.068
"How could my marriage
just explode the way it did?"

05:10.519 --> 05:13.113
<i>And like
all the best psychiatrists,</i>

05:13.188 --> 05:15.737
<i>he knew how to answer
a question with a question.</i>

05:15.816 --> 05:19.741
Jane, what does exploding
mean to you?

05:19.820 --> 05:22.539
It's no good.
I have lost my psychic mojo.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.708
Oh, I just can't see
a way out.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.753
All my clients will leave me.

05:30.121 --> 05:33.125
Hector, look at me,
I want the truth.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.336
Do you see my light?

05:35.418 --> 05:37.341
Here.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.798
Please, don't lie to me.

05:39.881 --> 05:41.224
I see your point.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.555
<i>His patients never
crossed paths with each other.</i>

05:48.056 --> 05:49.399
<i>They couldn't.</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:54.355
<i>Once in a while,
Hector prescribed pills</i>

05:54.437 --> 05:55.984
<i>with funny sounding names.</i>

05:56.064 --> 05:59.159
Roger, have you taken your meds?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.362
I am fucking Ferrari.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.445
What?

06:02.529 --> 06:04.281
<i>Experimenting
until he landed upon</i>

06:04.364 --> 06:06.992
<i>- the one most suitable.
- Roger...</i>

06:07.075 --> 06:09.749
Two fat ladies!
Eighty-eight.

06:10.954 --> 06:13.252
<i>His clients always returned.</i>

06:13.331 --> 06:15.208
<i>They gave his name
to their friends</i>

06:15.292 --> 06:17.795
<i>who gave his name
to their friends.</i>

06:21.423 --> 06:24.142
<i>After all, Hector's rates
were very fair.</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:25.969
<i>They hadn't changed in years.</i>

06:26.052 --> 06:27.429
<i>Okay-</i>

06:28.763 --> 06:32.518
<i>Come to think of it,
neither had Hector.</i>

06:35.353 --> 06:36.993
And if that wasn't enough...

06:37.063 --> 06:38.690
within six days,

06:38.773 --> 06:41.151
our Clara discovers the name
for a companion drug,

06:41.234 --> 06:44.534
which had eluded the marketing
department for six months.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.204
Now, that's a talent for words.

06:48.283 --> 06:50.832
But what I love most
about her

06:50.911 --> 06:53.915
is that in the 10 years
that she's been with us,

06:53.997 --> 06:58.218
she has yet to discover
the words "maternity" or "leave."

07:02.255 --> 07:04.178
Clara.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.227
Thank you, all, so much.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.272
What's in a name?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.725
A glimmer of hope.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.275
A chance for change.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.398
That's right.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.400
A way to alleviate suffering.

07:17.479 --> 07:21.780
It's been five years
since we launched Tranquiline.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.156
Correction. No, it's been
a lifetime for those

07:24.235 --> 07:26.283
- who benefited from it.
- Yeah.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.286
I'm getting emotional.
To Marketing.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.039
I love you guys!

07:35.330 --> 07:38.960
C'est magnifique!

07:39.042 --> 07:40.510
Hit that key.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.851
No. No..

07:47.926 --> 07:51.396
Not me. Not me. Oh!

07:51.471 --> 07:53.348
Come on!

07:53.431 --> 07:56.526
Give them money.

08:00.438 --> 08:03.237
Oh, it's...

08:05.652 --> 08:07.325
Yay!

08:07.946 --> 08:09.448
"What am I doing?"

08:14.327 --> 08:16.580
You are intriguing me.

08:18.123 --> 08:21.423
You are not working
with these people?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.550
Oh, no, I'm Hector.
I'm a psychiatrist.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.178
Psychiatrist.

08:27.257 --> 08:30.227
Hello.
You can help me.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.644
Oh, I think not.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.394
But I want a penis.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.477
- A penis.
- You mean happiness.

08:38.559 --> 08:43.817
Everybody want 'appiness
but you cannot own 'appiness.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.361
Yes, sorry.
It's, uh, elusive, yeah.

08:47.444 --> 08:53.167
- You can't touch happiness.
- You cannot touch 'appiness.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.127
I do!

09:00.206 --> 09:03.961
Listen to me, I want
a penis in my bottom.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.350
No, no, you want happiness
from the bottom of your heart.

09:10.425 --> 09:15.352
That is what I said,
a penis... in my bottom.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.896
Stop it.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.446
Oh, God!

09:23.521 --> 09:24.521
<i>- Ahh!
- Oh!</i>

09:26.691 --> 09:28.364
I love my Hector.

09:28.443 --> 09:30.320
I love my Clara.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.781
No, really, I love

09:32.864 --> 09:35.993
my weird-ass-eccentric-

09:36.076 --> 09:39.421
nobody-else-is-like-him Hector.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.090
Promise me you'll never change.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.098
Thank you for humoring
all my friends.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.393
You know I'd do
the same for you.

09:57.138 --> 10:01.063
- I don't have any friends.
- Of course you do, Hector.

10:12.487 --> 10:15.240
Back off, Malcolm.
That's not funny.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.409
Give me your hand.

10:56.281 --> 11:00.411
Oh, no, see?
Nothing. Nope.

11:00.577 --> 11:05.083
I can still, you know, talk
the talk like you do, Hector.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.338
Like the way you answer
a question with a question.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.839
What do you mean?

11:08.918 --> 11:12.343
Yeah, that's it.
"Who's this to?"

11:12.422 --> 11:15.221
- You're so transparent, Hector.
- Am I?

11:15.300 --> 11:16.847
You have your
non-committal nonsense,

11:16.926 --> 11:20.681
I have my new age wealth lie
I can serve up to any client.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.231
"Your mother has had
a hard life."

11:22.307 --> 11:24.309
Tell me what mother
hasn't had a hard life.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.736
Or "You're going
on a journey."

11:26.811 --> 11:28.404
I feel like a fraud.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.983
Don't tell me you don't know
what I'm talking about.

11:35.987 --> 11:40.163
Everyday, you're just going
through the motions,

11:40.241 --> 11:43.791
never being authentic.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.292
Authentic.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.508
You know what, Anjali, I think this
represents some sort of growth.

11:51.586 --> 11:56.808
You know, just be careful that
when you have these visions...

11:56.883 --> 11:58.351
Hallucination.

11:58.426 --> 12:03.307
That the ego might just be
shaping them to its own needs.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.777
Let's try the medication
for another week, shall we?

12:12.273 --> 12:13.866
But the tumor was benign.

12:13.942 --> 12:16.036
Yeah.
No, no, yeah. No.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.538
Yes or no?

12:20.657 --> 12:21.658
Yes.

12:22.992 --> 12:27.372
So, this isn't even
a cancer story.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.396
<i>Hector.</i>

12:43.471 --> 12:46.645
You seem a little blue.
Not your usual self.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.021
Is it Roger?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.024
No. No.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.982
Um, actually, Ben,
it's my other patients.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.158
You know, they all like
to think they're hopeless.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.027
That's hopeless.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.122
<i>Are you happy?</i>

13:11.291 --> 13:12.811
You're breaking up with me,
aren't you?

13:12.834 --> 13:13.835
No! No.

13:13.918 --> 13:16.216
You can't just come out
with a question like that.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.264
You have to build up to it.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.779
You know you have
to have a preamble.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.928
Alright, alright.
I'm sorry.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.890
Do you consider yourself
to be happy?

13:27.515 --> 13:28.937
Alright, look.
Okay.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.063
I've got it, I've got it,
I've got it.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.116
Far be it from me,
and I...

13:36.190 --> 13:39.694
Forgive me for asking,
and I don't mean to pry.

13:39.777 --> 13:47.537
But... do you consider yourself
<i>as</i> a happy person?

13:47.618 --> 13:51.543
Is this because I'm not ready
to be a mother?

13:51.622 --> 13:53.545
- Other hand, please.
- Absolutely not.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.547
- But I've only done the left one.
- Sorry.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.676
This has nothing... nothing to do
with you not being a mother.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.473
I know what you're saying, Hector.

14:06.262 --> 14:10.688
No one wants to live with a person
knowing they'll never be happy.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.656
- So, you're, uh...
- Back in business.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.278
- Yes.
- And you can...

14:18.358 --> 14:20.986
Channel what's to come.
See the future. Yes.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.413
- Mm-hmm.
- Give me your hand.

14:23.488 --> 14:26.662
- Oh, not again.
- Please. Come on.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.244
Wait, are we off the clock?

14:29.327 --> 14:30.704
- Call it even.
- Cool.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.585
But you are getting a bargain.
I charge more than you.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.587
I keep telling you,
you should put up your fees.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.215
You're going on a journey.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.016
Am I?

14:47.512 --> 14:49.105
Be serious.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.854
I am. You are.

14:51.933 --> 14:52.934
To distant lands.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.908
Well, is there anything else?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.246
I see you're at peace.
I see you're happy.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.073
Really?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.748
I see you loving like
you've never loved before.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.255
Wow!

15:16.833 --> 15:19.302
Yeah, well.

15:19.377 --> 15:24.224
- Maybe in my next life.
- Hector, this is your next life.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.352
- I see you with a dead dog.
- What?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.788
You're a little boy.
You're crying.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.689
Oh, my God!
You were an only child.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.732
- A lonely child, you poor thing.
- Oh, come on.

15:33.808 --> 15:37.608
It makes sense, your life.
How exhausting.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.486
- I see a girl on a beach.
- What do you mean a girl on a...

15:40.565 --> 15:42.738
- Why have you never called her?
- What do you mean call her?

15:42.817 --> 15:45.616
- Are you sterile?
- No, I am not sterile.

15:45.695 --> 15:46.935
<i>No, no, no, wait.
That's not it.</i>

15:46.988 --> 15:49.616
It's your life.
Why am I getting sterility?

15:49.699 --> 15:52.168
Someone is hurting you,
making you angry.

15:52.243 --> 15:54.416
- Time's up.
- It's you.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.169
- Come on.
- It's you. You're making you angry.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.125
Just stop, okay! Stop.
Stop projecting.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.176
I'm not the patient here,
Anjali, come on.

16:01.252 --> 16:03.300
- So exhausting.
- Yes, so exhausting.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.508
I know, I know. Thank you.
See you next week. Thank you.

16:06.591 --> 16:09.936
Who's Agnes?

16:15.391 --> 16:17.314
I can't sell the house,
the cracks are back.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.021
They'd taken it off the menu.
The evening was ruined.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.277
The only reason to go there
was the white pie.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.108
I'm thinking of taking in
other people's laundry.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.365
To get some extra cash
to help pay for the nanny.

16:26.444 --> 16:28.071
Otherwise, we're going under.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.577
I was doing the exercises,
but I fell asleep.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.909
And now the sergeant says
I'm not standing straight.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.084
Nobody brought me a birthday...

16:34.160 --> 16:35.285
Present I actually wanted.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.412
- About the matter of weight...

16:36.496 --> 16:38.590
But his feet
really are a problem.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.713
Nipples just aren't
an erogenous zone for men.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.466
I'm gonna have to cut the nanny
down to five days a week.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.640
- It's an uphill battle.
- I'm at the end of my rope.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.315
The end of your rope.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.691
- The end of your rope!
- Yeah.

17:01.771 --> 17:02.897
I'll give you a rope.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.858
Okay, a child witnessing
his parents gunned down

17:05.942 --> 17:08.286
in a drive-by shooting,
there's a rope!

17:08.361 --> 17:10.829
A midwife in Africa,
trying to deliver babies

17:10.905 --> 17:12.999
with no running water,
that is a rope!

17:13.074 --> 17:14.666
Tintin.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.493
Literally at the end
of his rope.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.295
Does he cut the rope
to save his own life

17:18.371 --> 17:20.920
or does he hold on to stop his friend
from falling to a certain death?

17:20.998 --> 17:24.047
Cut the rope, Tintin!
Cut the rope!

17:25.752 --> 17:28.175
Jane, Jane!
Jane! Jane!

17:29.382 --> 17:31.885
I'm sorry.
I am very, very sorry.

17:31.968 --> 17:36.223
I don't know...
I don't know what came over me.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.773
Same time next week?

17:37.848 --> 17:42.604
Um, I have to take my daughter
sailing for a couple of days.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.689
Yes. Yes, I do remember
you mentioning that.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.991
So, the following week?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.284
I still won't be back.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.747
You said a couple of days.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.119
Yeah.

17:56.784 --> 18:02.882
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight... nine.

18:02.957 --> 18:05.005
This is not
a couple of days, okay?

18:05.084 --> 18:09.134
This is ten days holiday.
Jane, fucking own it!

18:26.731 --> 18:27.857
Malcolm...

18:30.568 --> 18:32.616
Malcolm, you stupid bastard!

18:35.114 --> 18:36.832
Give me that.
Give me that!

18:42.538 --> 18:44.586
Oh! Ridiculous!

18:53.382 --> 18:55.009
Euforalan.

18:55.092 --> 18:58.437
Solatun.
As in a ton of sun.

18:58.512 --> 19:02.267
Um, Apollonax.
Oh, no, that's the wrong list.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.943
Oh, that's funny,
that's for August.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.895
Uh, erectile dysfunction.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.482
What do you think, by the way?
Apollonax?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.283
Apollo and his axe?

19:11.359 --> 19:13.111
<i>Hoo!</i>

19:13.944 --> 19:16.163
I need to get away.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.623
Take a trip.

19:22.870 --> 19:27.250
I'm not making my patients
any happier and I just...

19:27.333 --> 19:30.086
I need to do some research.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.421
On what?

19:31.504 --> 19:35.134
Happiness, you know,
so I can help.

19:35.216 --> 19:38.720
Look at my life, Clara,
I just...

19:38.803 --> 19:41.022
I feel like such a fraud.

19:41.097 --> 19:43.691
You know, like
an armchair traveler

19:43.766 --> 19:47.270
dishing out worldly advice.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.230
When?

19:49.313 --> 19:51.486
Soon.
Very soon. Now.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.284
There's no way I can get
the time off, I mean not now.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.362
Not at this time of the year.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.328
I know.

20:05.788 --> 20:07.461
I'm sorry.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.384
Okay, I'm sorry.
I really, really am.

20:12.837 --> 20:14.464
Will you be here
when I get back?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.720
How long will you be gone?

20:17.883 --> 20:21.262
I don't know.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.524
Then I can't answer
the question, can I?

20:34.066 --> 20:37.661
I think you're right, I think
I just went totally off the map

20:37.737 --> 20:40.456
with that whole Tintin reference.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.659
Now, don't get me wrong.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.245
There's real value
to your inner Tintin.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.455
- My what?
- Your inner Tintin.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.006
The Boy Scout in you.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.754
Don't ever lose it.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.837
It's just that...
Well, how can I put this.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.762
Just so long as Tintin
isn't driving the bus.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.729
Where were you thinking of going
on this journey of yours?

21:02.803 --> 21:04.601
I was thinking China.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.899
Oh, China!

21:12.772 --> 21:14.774
Brilliant.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.279
Sleeves...

21:16.358 --> 21:17.780
- Removable.
- Obviously.

21:17.860 --> 21:20.704
- Trousers, convertible.
- Obviously.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.702
Hat, reversible.

21:22.782 --> 21:23.829
Obviously.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.127
Oh, and in case
of emergencies...

21:26.202 --> 21:27.704
Oh, God forbid.

21:27.787 --> 21:31.087
Passport, lmodium,
antihistamine, nose strips.

21:31.165 --> 21:33.213
- And remember, avoid dairy.
- Yes.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.760
Got enough socks?

21:34.835 --> 21:37.964
Uh... yes, I think so.

21:38.088 --> 21:41.934
I don't want to over-pack it,
and, you know, it all fits.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.637
Neat and tidy, like us.

21:47.181 --> 21:49.980
- What's like us?
- Tidy.

21:50.059 --> 21:53.529
It's like who we are.
Tidy.

21:53.604 --> 21:57.780
It's like that's our...
agreement, isn't it?

21:59.693 --> 22:01.115
Hector...

22:01.946 --> 22:03.823
I get it.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.206
If you're gonna do this,
do it totally.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.831
Make it worthwhile.

22:08.911 --> 22:11.505
Okay, you have
my permission, alright?

22:12.456 --> 22:16.256
- Really?
- Really. I mean it.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.554
Totally.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.637
Can I help you, sir?

22:34.687 --> 22:36.610
Arms up, please, sir.

22:49.910 --> 22:53.084
- Hey, you sit in my seat.
- Pardon?

22:53.163 --> 22:55.165
I make an Internet booking
weeks ago.

22:55.249 --> 22:56.717
No, no, what are you, 39-D?

22:56.792 --> 22:58.840
Expects you that you
travel on my lap?

22:58.919 --> 23:00.921
Look, there's obviously been
some sort of mix-up.

23:01.005 --> 23:04.134
- I'll do whatever you want.
- Let me go and check.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.974
This way, sir.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.353
- Your seat.
- Okay.

23:11.432 --> 23:13.400
Great.

23:13.475 --> 23:14.977
Sorry, could you move your bag?
Sorry.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.312
Champagne, sir.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.147
- Is the Pope circumcised?
- Uh-hmm.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.741
Don't you mean...

23:24.111 --> 23:26.330
- Mm.
- Ahh!

23:26.405 --> 23:28.874
Can I please get the champagne
from first class at least?

23:28.949 --> 23:31.327
- A decent one.
- Ah, I doubt it.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.582
This isn't decent?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.334
- Down or memory foam?
- What?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.836
The pillow.
Did you order memory foam?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.339
I forget. Did I?

23:39.418 --> 23:41.091
That's my little joke.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.170
I'm sorry, sir, I'm going
to need to stow your bag.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.469
Of course.
Please do.

23:49.136 --> 23:52.106
- Oh.
- Sorry. I'll get it.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.934
Oh! It's like Twister.
Oh, you've won.

23:55.017 --> 23:56.189
Ah.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.610
Thank you.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.823
Ohh.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.328
Isn't that sweet?

24:14.954 --> 24:17.423
Oh, look at that.

24:17.498 --> 24:21.002
It's a gift from my other half.

24:21.085 --> 24:23.838
She must have snuck it
into my bag and I didn't know.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.218
"Fill these pages."

24:29.385 --> 24:31.513
I will.

25:06.797 --> 25:09.266
- Anything from Duty-Free, sir?
- Oh, yes, please.

25:09.341 --> 25:13.096
Actually, I'd like the keep-it
handy travel candy, please.

25:13.178 --> 25:16.102
- Immigration form?
- Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.373
Give it back.

25:33.449 --> 25:36.419
- It costs more than your car.
- Thank you.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.046
- Sorry.
- Don't worry, sir.

25:43.125 --> 25:46.299
- The glass is unbreakable.
- Ah. Very clever.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.051
Unbreakable.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.717
Unbreakable.

25:52.718 --> 25:53.719
Hmm.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.311
Oi.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.189
Uh, sorry, um...

26:01.268 --> 26:03.236
Are you sure there's no room
in first class?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.529
I'm sorry, sir.

26:33.926 --> 26:37.601
- Wife?
- Old flame, university.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.807
We all got one of those.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.142
First time in China?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.728
- Yeah.
- Business or pleasure?

26:43.811 --> 26:47.486
Research, actually.
I'm a psychiatrist.

26:48.565 --> 26:50.988
I want to know
what makes people happy.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.511
Hector.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.722
Edward.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.550
Watch yourself.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.633
<i>Okay-</i>

27:25.310 --> 27:27.779
Thank you.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.111
Oh.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.318
That fucker's got my fucking pen.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.612
Edward!
I still got your pen.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.876
Yes, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Alright.

27:41.785 --> 27:43.037
Wait.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.416
I can't thank you enough.

27:47.499 --> 27:48.967
So, where are you staying?

27:49.042 --> 27:50.419
At the Marriott.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.254
The Marriott for happy?

27:52.337 --> 27:54.465
Well, it's central.

27:54.548 --> 27:57.518
Why, have you got
any other suggestions?

27:57.593 --> 28:00.312
Let me show you happy.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.613
Whoever said
money can't buy happiness.

28:58.695 --> 29:00.618
Fuck you.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.370
This is incredible.
This is incredible.

29:02.449 --> 29:05.498
Just incredible, the whole thing.
The meal, my room.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.955
Edward, I'm just...
I'm curious, okay?

29:08.038 --> 29:10.712
Far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.886
- And I don't mean to pry.
- Time is money. Spit it out.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.161
- Right. Are you happy?
- When you work <i>as</i> much <i>as</i> I do,

29:17.089 --> 29:19.308
you don't have time to ask
yourself that question.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.101
That's why
I'm thinking of quitting.

29:21.176 --> 29:22.894
What, now?

29:22.970 --> 29:25.143
God, no.
In another $20 million.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.355
Mind you, I've been saying that
for the last $100 million.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.028
Oh, you bust a gut, you earn
enough money, you retire,

29:32.104 --> 29:34.857
you do something you like.

29:36.483 --> 29:38.577
Or nothing at all.

29:38.652 --> 29:39.949
And then you're happy?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.208
Yeah, we're addicted.

29:44.283 --> 29:48.254
Divorced or dead.
What the hell?

29:51.456 --> 29:52.457
Oh.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.760
You pick a goal,
you work towards it.

29:54.835 --> 29:56.007
Makes you feel better.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.963
Just keep moving,
that's my motto.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.970
Maybe there's only one way
to retire and be happy.

30:01.049 --> 30:02.722
And what's that?

30:02.801 --> 30:05.805
Don't retire.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.687
It's time for some real China.
Come on.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.609
Real? Okay.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.188
Let me just grab a bit of this.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.202
It's not what you know, Hector.
It's not who you know.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.326
It's how much you pay
who you know.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.426
- Hey, how are you?
- How have you been? Hello.

30:48.263 --> 30:51.016
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Edward.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.699
- Back from Berlin.
- You're back in town.

30:52.726 --> 30:54.820
By the way,
this is Mr. Perry.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.999
What are you doing?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.167
- Uh, I'm...
- Are you a writer?

31:13.330 --> 31:15.879
No, um... No, I'm just
taking some notes.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.724
- Do you believe that?
- Well, I wouldn't know.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.730
I'm not rich
and I'm not important, so...

31:35.060 --> 31:37.939
What a coincidence.
Neither am l.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.273
Oh.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.610
"The search for happiness."

31:45.946 --> 31:47.994
Is it in here?

31:49.241 --> 31:51.118
No.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.250
Perhaps over there.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.127
Uh, no, no.

31:56.206 --> 31:58.208
That is torture for me.
I don't dance.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.885
Why not? I mean, you don't like
to move around...

32:00.961 --> 32:02.554
- No, I really...
- ...and move your body a little?

32:02.629 --> 32:03.846
- No.
- Come on, it's fun.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.095
I... You know what, it's...

32:07.008 --> 32:11.184
Or is it right here...

32:12.347 --> 32:14.349
in your smile?

32:18.937 --> 32:22.066
My name is Ying Li.
I'm a student.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.868
Hector.

32:24.943 --> 32:27.742
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

32:29.781 --> 32:32.159
Oops, sorry.
Too long.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.499
- So, what do you study, Ying Li?
- Tourism.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.175
I'm a tourist.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.719
What a coincidence.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.639
Oh, oh, oh.
Hm-mm.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.850
- Edward!
- Having a good time?

32:56.933 --> 32:59.436
Yeah.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.653
Oh, that was mine?
I wasn't aware I was drinking.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.154
You go next.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.450
Listen to this.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.871
Well, I will drink to that.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.372
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.914
Hey, I have an idea.
I have an idea.

33:18.997 --> 33:23.093
Who is available tomorrow night?
Let's mark the bottle.

33:23.168 --> 33:24.966
- Hey, you're cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.173
- You are cheating.
- No, no, no.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.555
- I'm not cheating.
- You are cheating.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.887
- You're cheating.
- Lighten up, lighten up.

33:32.969 --> 33:34.937
Alright, alright, alright.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.443
Will I see you again?

33:44.523 --> 33:46.366
What hotel are you staying at?

33:46.441 --> 33:48.660
Hyatt on the Bund.

33:48.735 --> 33:51.659
What a coincidence.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.547
Welcome back
to Hyatt on the Bund.

34:19.391 --> 34:20.483
Well, I'm, uh...

34:20.559 --> 34:24.655
I'm not sure what the custom is
for escorting a young lady

34:24.728 --> 34:27.232
to her room.

35:04.978 --> 35:06.776
I'll be right back.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.672
I'm not sure
what the custom is...

35:32.380 --> 35:34.883
for undressing in front of...

35:37.344 --> 35:39.938
Hector?

35:40.013 --> 35:41.640
Hector?

35:43.391 --> 35:44.859
Hector.

37:21.823 --> 37:22.823
This is Hector.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.368
<i>Did you have
a good time last night?</i>

37:24.451 --> 37:26.328
Yeah, you know happy.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.505
Hey, I gotta go-

37:29.080 --> 37:32.425
Um, I'd really like
to take you to lunch.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.343
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:34.419 --> 37:35.841
Um, you pick.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.799
Just text me when and where.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.137
Yeah.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.932
Yeah, it's nice.
I like it.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.566
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.368
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:46.449 --> 38:48.326
Listen, this is China.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.503
You're Chinese.
I'm clueless.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.672
I need to get
to the mountains.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.546
Why don't you come with me?

38:55.625 --> 38:57.252
- Too soon?
- Hmm.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.588
It's preamble, Hector.
Preamble.

38:59.671 --> 39:03.392
No.
It's just... you're different.

39:03.466 --> 39:05.389
You're kind.

39:05.468 --> 39:06.560
I'm not used to it.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.564
They look very happy.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.361
<i>They're with their friends.</i>

39:15.436 --> 39:17.676
<i>Why are they sitting
in the middle of the street?</i>

39:18.398 --> 39:21.322
They have nowhere else to go.
It's their day off.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.995
They have no money
to stay in cafes.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.947
They send their income
to their families,

39:26.030 --> 39:27.998
so they meet here
on the street.

39:28.074 --> 39:30.793
They come from
the countryside like I do.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.839
My sisters and mother
are still there.

39:33.913 --> 39:36.507
Look at them, they're like
a happy little island

39:36.583 --> 39:38.301
in a sea
of grim businessmen.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.969
Makes you wonder.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.421
Hey, listen.

39:41.504 --> 39:44.303
Your mother and your sisters,
we could pay them a visit,

39:44.382 --> 39:47.386
you know on our trip.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.431
Oh, Hector.

39:52.599 --> 39:57.355
The difference between
those three ladies and me...

39:57.437 --> 40:02.568
is that there's no shame
in how they make their money.

40:02.650 --> 40:05.324
They can show
their faces back home.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.909
I can't.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.539
Oh.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.587
Oh, why is that then?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.509
Ying Li!

40:23.171 --> 40:24.718
Hey, wait.

40:24.797 --> 40:26.237
Sorry. Sorry.

40:26.299 --> 40:28.259
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

40:28.301 --> 40:30.349
Your friend paid
for last night.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.352
Who's paying for today?

40:37.477 --> 40:39.946
But you seemed so real.
You tricked me.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.614
You tricked me.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.368
What are you doing?
What are you...

40:56.746 --> 40:57.918
Ying Li!

40:59.499 --> 41:00.499
Ying Li!

43:13.966 --> 43:16.185
It's Monday, we are closed.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.683
Oh, yeah, but I've come
a very long way.

43:18.763 --> 43:22.643
I'm a psychiatrist. I'm trying to
discover what makes people happy.

43:22.725 --> 43:25.569
- It's Monday, we are closed.
- Okay, okay, okay.

43:25.645 --> 43:28.319
Look, far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking,

43:28.397 --> 43:31.150
and I don't mean to pry,
but would you consider yourself

43:31.234 --> 43:32.827
to be a happy person?

43:32.902 --> 43:35.746
What part of Monday
don't you understand?

43:38.866 --> 43:41.289
A trainee.
He has a lot to learn.

43:41.369 --> 43:43.292
- Would you like to come in?
- Uh, yes, please.

43:43.371 --> 43:44.964
'Cause I might not
be around next week.

43:45.039 --> 43:48.589
The moment of death
is indeed uncertain.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.511
Now, come in.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.561
<i>- Come,</i> come, <i>quick!</i>
- Okay.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.363
When you've been a fugitive,

44:09.438 --> 44:11.065
you've been imprisoned
for your beliefs,

44:11.149 --> 44:13.277
you've lost family
and loved ones.

44:13.359 --> 44:15.532
I mean, you've just been
through so much.

44:15.611 --> 44:19.332
- How is it you're so happy?
- Because I've been through so much.

44:20.616 --> 44:22.539
Alright, searching for happiness
is one thing,

44:22.618 --> 44:25.246
but making it a goal, that just
doesn't work, does it?

44:25.329 --> 44:27.798
Higher than that, Hector.

44:29.500 --> 44:32.253
More important than
what we are searching for

44:32.336 --> 44:34.680
is what we are avoiding.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.052
Like unhappiness.

44:36.132 --> 44:39.807
So, don't make unhappiness
not the goal.

44:39.886 --> 44:41.854
Higher than that.

44:43.639 --> 44:46.813
Avoiding unhappiness
is not the road to happiness.

44:48.060 --> 44:50.688
You hold all the cards, Hector.

45:11.667 --> 45:14.716
It's very noble this book
you're writing.

45:14.795 --> 45:18.220
When you reach the end of it,
come back to me.

45:18.299 --> 45:21.348
I would like to see
what you've learned.

45:21.427 --> 45:24.601
Right, you mean when I'm
passing through this area again.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.682
We have Skype.

45:26.766 --> 45:28.689
"Sky-pee."

45:28.768 --> 45:31.362
You have Skype?

45:35.024 --> 45:36.742
<i>- Hi.
- Hector?</i>

45:36.817 --> 45:38.865
- Hi!
- Hi!

45:38.945 --> 45:40.538
Hi.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.707
How is it going?
How's work?

45:42.782 --> 45:43.999
<i>It's great.</i>

45:44.075 --> 45:46.294
<i>Can you believe it,
they're going with Apollonax?</i>

45:46.369 --> 45:49.043
<i>Whoo-hoo! Market research says
it's the biggest erection</i>

45:49.121 --> 45:51.465
<i>they've had to...
I mean, sorry, sorry.</i>

45:51.540 --> 45:55.170
<i>Reaction they've had
to a survey in 10 years.</i>

45:56.170 --> 45:58.264
Clara, look where I am,
I'm in a monastery.

45:58.339 --> 45:59.511
<i>Where you belong.</i>

45:59.590 --> 46:02.309
<i>How is Shanghai?</i>

46:02.385 --> 46:04.683
Yeah, I've made friends
with a rich banker,

46:04.762 --> 46:06.730
and he took me around town
and we...

46:06.806 --> 46:09.810
<i>Now, you know every kind
of happiness money could buy.</i>

46:19.902 --> 46:22.655
<i>It's weird seeing you like this,
you look really small.</i>

46:34.667 --> 46:36.214
Hector, come, come.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.012
You have to see.
The wind. Come!

47:02.403 --> 47:04.781
Hector! Look.

47:06.032 --> 47:08.251
Do you see?

47:08.326 --> 47:10.078
All of them.

47:21.422 --> 47:23.971
Looks like we lost
the scent, eh?

47:26.552 --> 47:29.146
Best keep moving, shall we?

47:46.447 --> 47:48.120
Poor bastard.

47:48.199 --> 47:50.497
I'm sorry.

47:50.576 --> 47:51.668
Where to next?

47:51.744 --> 47:54.167
- Africa.
- For happy?

47:54.246 --> 47:55.998
Or unhappy-

47:56.082 --> 47:57.425
Have to wait and see.

47:58.667 --> 48:00.920
You're a very, very
strange person, Hector.

48:01.003 --> 48:03.847
The kind of person I normally
would avoid like the plague.

48:05.633 --> 48:09.012
Glad I didn't, buddy.

48:10.262 --> 48:12.185
Thank you, Edward.
I mean it.

48:26.654 --> 48:29.578
Sir, you do realize that
this is four flights.

48:29.657 --> 48:31.705
- That is two days.
- Absolutely.

48:31.784 --> 48:34.754
And the last flight is not so...

48:34.829 --> 48:37.002
- Well, it is not exactly...
- Absolutely.

48:37.081 --> 48:40.051
Let me put it this way.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.844
First class.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.011
Business class.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.805
Economy.

48:46.715 --> 48:48.183
You.

48:50.594 --> 48:51.686
Bring it.

48:56.392 --> 48:58.144
Oh! Oh!

48:59.854 --> 49:03.700
Oh, my God!

49:05.192 --> 49:07.820
If you look at this plane,
you'll notice it's quite old.

49:07.903 --> 49:09.997
That means it's never
crashed before.

49:10.072 --> 49:12.825
Should be quite reassuring.

49:12.908 --> 49:15.161
Thank you... I think.

49:16.996 --> 49:18.964
From this point forward,
I swear,

49:19.039 --> 49:21.292
I will be nicer to my patients
who are afraid to fly.

49:21.375 --> 49:25.175
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- I'm a psychiatrist, yeah.

49:25.254 --> 49:27.552
So, I assume you've read this.

49:27.631 --> 49:31.135
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm familiar with
Coreman from my UCLA days.</i>

49:31.218 --> 49:32.470
Just making a name for himself.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.647
Oh, quite a name.
I saw him on CNN.

49:34.722 --> 49:36.224
What do they call him?

49:36.307 --> 49:38.560
The Einstein of happiness.

49:38.642 --> 49:41.316
I've read it twice.
You can keep it.

49:41.395 --> 49:43.443
I like it
but I don't think I need it

49:43.522 --> 49:45.570
as much as the country
it was written for.

49:45.649 --> 49:47.026
Thanks.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.157
Oh, my God!
Is this really safe?

49:52.323 --> 49:54.041
Oh, God!

49:54.116 --> 49:56.039
Do you have children?
Are you married?

49:56.118 --> 49:59.372
- Um, no.
- Why not?

49:59.455 --> 50:01.503
Why do I get the feeling
there's a woman out there

50:01.582 --> 50:03.835
in the world asking herself
the very same question?

50:05.002 --> 50:07.096
You know, there's really
only one question.

50:12.551 --> 50:15.020
Whoa!

50:23.687 --> 50:26.782
Side effects
may include happiness.

50:26.857 --> 50:31.488
So, what about you?
What makes for your happiness?

50:31.570 --> 50:34.744
Home, family.

50:34.823 --> 50:37.417
The idea that my children
can live a normal life

50:37.493 --> 50:40.212
without bodyguards
taking them to school.

50:41.914 --> 50:44.292
Have you ever had
sweet potato stew?

50:44.375 --> 50:46.628
Real sweet potato stew?

50:46.710 --> 50:48.883
Oh, you have to.

50:48.963 --> 50:52.012
Here's the deal.
If we land safely,

50:52.091 --> 50:53.968
one night this week,
my mother's house,

50:54.051 --> 50:57.430
my whole family,
sweet potato stew.

51:00.015 --> 51:02.939
There will be a tomorrow,
my friend.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.611
<i>Whoa!</i>

51:10.276 --> 51:11.448
I'll be right back.

51:15.614 --> 51:18.083
- Why don't you let me do this?
- That's very kind.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.379
Get the button, get the button,
there's a button.

51:25.457 --> 51:26.674
Hector!

51:27.501 --> 51:29.549
Michael, Jesus!

51:29.628 --> 51:30.754
Help.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.512
<i>Can anyone...
I've got</i> a <i>Swiss army knife.</i>

51:33.591 --> 51:36.185
- Oh, dear.
- This is Marcel.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.557
- He's your bodyguard.
- Hi.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.981
Hector. Welcome.

51:41.056 --> 51:44.356
Cars are scarce here,
so better to take precautions.

51:44.435 --> 51:45.982
Okay, let's go.

51:54.612 --> 51:56.330
See, you haven't changed.

51:58.198 --> 51:59.450
Neither have you.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.001
I mean, look at you.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.249
Hector goes to Africa.

52:05.080 --> 52:06.457
You and Aggie,
you seemed so solid,

52:06.540 --> 52:07.587
what happened with that?

52:07.666 --> 52:09.293
Uh...

52:09.376 --> 52:11.595
Hey, Agnes and I always knew
you'd wind up here

52:11.670 --> 52:13.013
when the dust settled.

52:13.088 --> 52:15.967
Yup, all this.

52:16.050 --> 52:17.927
This was my calling,
wasn't it?

52:18.010 --> 52:21.014
Well, the dust, as you put it
never really settled.

52:21.096 --> 52:22.723
There's been progress,
though, right?

52:22.806 --> 52:25.810
I mean, foreign aid. Every time
I blink there's another fundraiser.

52:25.893 --> 52:28.237
There's a big difference
between being here

52:28.312 --> 52:30.906
and being here
to be photographed being here.

52:30.981 --> 52:33.530
The money doesn't always make it
to where it's needed most.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.129
It never leaves the city.
It's useless.

52:35.194 --> 52:38.824
It's useless.
Still a ways to go, Hector.

52:38.906 --> 52:42.080
But, hey, that's why
we're here, right?

53:00.052 --> 53:01.929
<i>Okay-</i>

53:02.012 --> 53:03.412
You have a good night's rest, okay?

53:03.430 --> 53:05.728
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

53:05.808 --> 53:07.526
- Whoa! Hey!
- Don't give them anything.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.023
They'll never leave you alone.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.356
Hector, we'll pick you up
at 6:00.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.065
Go straight to the clinic, okay?

53:13.148 --> 53:15.071
See you tomorrow.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.215
Good evening.

53:38.298 --> 53:40.801
Um... hmm.

53:40.884 --> 53:42.181
What sort of beers you have?

53:46.849 --> 53:48.476
Thank you.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.611
I think you might need
a bigger sign outside.

53:51.687 --> 53:53.940
Some people seem to be missing it.

53:54.022 --> 53:58.903
Hey, guys. He wants to know
how is the peacekeeping going?

53:58.986 --> 54:01.830
You're here to save the planet?

54:01.905 --> 54:03.407
Plant some trees?

54:03.490 --> 54:06.209
Um, no, actually
I'm here to help out

54:06.285 --> 54:08.458
at the Edulu Clinic
for a week or two.

54:08.537 --> 54:10.380
What's in it for you?

54:11.915 --> 54:14.964
- Nothing.
- Hmm.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.506
Your English is very good.
Where are you from?

54:18.589 --> 54:21.342
Want to see my passport?

54:21.425 --> 54:23.098
Here you go.

54:27.181 --> 54:29.149
I prefer your hair
the way it is now.

54:32.436 --> 54:34.939
That's good.
I like that.

54:35.814 --> 54:38.488
So, uh, what brings you here?

54:38.567 --> 54:41.366
- Farming.
- Farming, oh.

54:41.445 --> 54:46.167
What kind, and uh, would that be
what makes you happy?

54:46.241 --> 54:48.664
What are you, the fucking
New York <i>Times?</i>

54:48.744 --> 54:51.918
No, I'm just researching
what makes people happy.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.338
If you're wearing a wire,
you're dead.

54:59.421 --> 55:00.547
- And you know what?
- Yes? Yes, yes?

55:00.631 --> 55:04.135
No one will care.
Okay.

55:04.218 --> 55:06.220
No wire.
Sorry for the shirt.

55:07.805 --> 55:09.398
Oh.

55:10.224 --> 55:12.147
My name is Hector.
I'm a psychiatrist.

55:12.226 --> 55:13.569
Very well, Hector.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.523
I'll bet what I farm
makes more people happy

55:16.605 --> 55:19.358
than the crap you dish out.

55:19.441 --> 55:23.491
I see. A farmer.
I get it.

55:23.570 --> 55:24.696
Drugs.

55:27.741 --> 55:30.085
Forgive me,
but if your happiness

55:30.160 --> 55:32.379
causes other people's unhappiness,

55:32.454 --> 55:34.331
then how can that be happiness?

55:34.414 --> 55:36.667
Doesn't that bother you?

55:36.750 --> 55:38.969
I don't cause unhappiness.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.674
I respond to it.
Same as you, we both fill a need.

55:42.756 --> 55:44.679
But the demand we don't create.

55:44.758 --> 55:48.353
Self-righteous fuckers.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.430
What's your solution?

55:50.514 --> 55:52.061
Another Bible?

55:52.140 --> 55:54.609
So, the country gets more poor.

55:54.685 --> 55:58.861
People starve, babies die,
and the leaders couldn't care less.

56:00.482 --> 56:03.952
If you want to be happy,
take care of your own.

56:07.781 --> 56:09.624
So, you're happy'?

56:12.661 --> 56:15.039
No.

56:15.122 --> 56:17.716
Because my wife isn't happy,

56:17.791 --> 56:20.465
which makes my kids unhappy.

56:20.544 --> 56:23.673
And if my family
is not happy,

56:23.755 --> 56:25.177
how can I be happy?

56:27.676 --> 56:29.519
She sees a shrink.

56:29.595 --> 56:33.896
He gave her something new,
but it just makes her worse.

56:34.808 --> 56:37.402
Would you mind if I ask
what she's taking?

56:37.477 --> 56:39.855
I don't know.

56:39.938 --> 56:43.158
Maybe if you were to show me
the prescription, I could help.

56:44.693 --> 56:47.321
- Why?
- I'd like to.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.031
Bullshit.

56:49.114 --> 56:51.708
You're in it for yourself
like everyone else.

56:51.783 --> 56:56.414
Why would either of us
wish to prolong anyone else's misery?

56:57.915 --> 56:59.667
Fuck you.

57:13.221 --> 57:16.942
Holy grief, what is that?

57:17.017 --> 57:20.271
<i>Higher.</i>

57:20.354 --> 57:25.235
<i>With patience and perseverance,
you can climb the mountain.</i>

57:44.127 --> 57:46.255
Well, I don't know these dosages.

57:46.338 --> 57:48.215
And, uh, these two clash.

57:48.298 --> 57:50.426
Let me, um...

57:51.635 --> 57:54.639
I'm sorry, me and pens...

57:54.721 --> 57:56.894
Thank you.

57:56.974 --> 57:58.692
Um, this woman is great.

57:58.767 --> 58:01.190
She's based in Bogota.
She's an old colleague of mine.

58:01.269 --> 58:03.067
Tell her that I referred your wife.

58:03.146 --> 58:04.398
I think she's been over-medicated.

58:04.481 --> 58:06.825
Could be the source
of her immediate problem.

58:06.900 --> 58:08.322
This is my phone number.

58:08.402 --> 58:11.451
Give me a call.
Let me know how she goes.

58:11.530 --> 58:13.453
Thank you.

58:14.992 --> 58:18.166
Hector, it's past 6:00.
We gotta go.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.753
What were you doing
even talking to him?

58:22.833 --> 58:25.336
That's Diego Baresco.

58:25.419 --> 58:28.468
That's the kind of guy that
drags this country into shit.

58:31.883 --> 58:34.386
So, wait, you know that guy?

58:34.469 --> 58:37.018
Everybody knows Diego Baresco.

58:39.474 --> 58:42.523
Hector. Really?

59:18.430 --> 59:20.103
Mujari.

59:20.182 --> 59:21.183
- This is Hector.
- Hi.

59:22.934 --> 59:24.982
So, let's see.

59:26.313 --> 59:27.530
- How are you feeling?
- Very good.

59:27.606 --> 59:32.533
Can you feel the baby move?
So move on to Buruthi.

59:32.611 --> 59:34.705
Feel okay, hmm?

59:34.780 --> 59:37.659
This is my friend, Hector.
He's gonna help us, too.

59:37.741 --> 59:40.164
We'll just take a look.

59:40.327 --> 59:43.797
I don't hurt anymore.
Can I go home?

59:43.872 --> 59:45.670
You're not leaving here
until I say so.

59:45.749 --> 59:49.470
But my sister, she needs me.

59:49.544 --> 59:52.718
Buruthi lost his mother
last month.

59:52.798 --> 59:57.395
Listen, if you're not well,
you're no help to your sister.

59:57.469 --> 59:59.972
Good. Good boy.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:01.648
Stay with him.
Just talk to him.

01:00:01.723 --> 01:00:04.226
That I can do.

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.694
So, Buruthi...

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.114
how old is your sister?

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.375
- What?
- Your face, it's funny.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.669
It's like this.

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:29.169
Yeah, yeah.
That's my listening face.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.628
How about this?

01:00:33.713 --> 01:00:35.135
You, you're funny.

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:36.717
Oh, am I?
Thank you very much.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.730
You're a big boy.

01:00:48.436 --> 01:00:51.781
This is gonna be nothing.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:00:58.830
He's gonna be fine.

01:00:58.905 --> 01:01:00.748
Gonna be fine.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:07.873
Mama. Mama!

01:01:11.751 --> 01:01:13.424
Shh, shh.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:19.476
Is that a...
There's a lion over here.

01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:23.351
Michael, there's two lions,
just quite close.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:26.684
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.645
Take off your iPod,
there's a lion really close by.

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:32.277
Is this normal,
to have a lion?

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.324
See you, buddy.

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.712
You know you could always
stay awhile.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.415
We sure could use
another medical doctor.

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:51.966
It's tempting.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.716
I mean, watching you all week.
You are a necessity.

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:56.216
Me, I'm just...
I'm a luxury.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:59.766
I sometimes feel like psychiatry
comes with affluence.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.218
You know, the richer the city,

01:02:01.301 --> 01:02:03.724
the more psychiatrists there are
per square mile.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.225
What does that tell you?

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:08.309
It tells me you're being
too hard on yourself.

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.980
Come on, Hector, it's not
some kind of a competition.

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:17.492
The mind can hurt
as much <i>as</i> the body.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.833
And maybe if I seem happy,

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:28.833
it's because I know
I'm loved for who I am.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.012
<i>Okay-</i>

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:16.798
- Hello!
- Hello.

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:18.878
- Hey, I'm in Africa.
- Wow!

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:22.307
Great. I'm with Michael,
and he hasn't changed.

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.542
He looks exactly like he did
in the photo I showed you.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.269
<i>You never showed me
a photo of Michael.</i>

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:29.814
<i>- Didn't I?
- You just think you did.</i>

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:32.312
Mm. I thought I had.

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:37.819
Hey, listen, Clara, about
that last conversation we had...

01:03:37.897 --> 01:03:38.897
<i>Hi, boys.</i>

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.869
Hey, guys!

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.826
<i>Hey-</i>

01:03:45.905 --> 01:03:48.328
It's a private conversation.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:50.456
- Seriously, Clara...
- Hector, you know, I got it.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:51.536
<i>It's fine.</i>

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:53.838
<i>Let's not make this harder
than it already is.</i>

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.415
- Where are you going?
- Out.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:58.843
- What, like that?
- No, <i>in this.</i>

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.340
<i>- Oh.
- It's a work event.</i>

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.845
I've never seen that dress.
That dress is new.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:05.175
I know.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:07.852
<i>- I've got to go. Bye, Hector.
- What do you mean, bye?</i>

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:09.429
We've only...

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.140
Out? Huh.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:15.310
<i>Okay-</i>

01:04:15.393 --> 01:04:16.861
Out.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.405
- Hector.
- Hey.

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:21.358
They told me you'll come.
You're early.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.863
You can get class another time.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:25.036
So, you are ready
for sweet potato soup?

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:26.237
I've never been readier
in my life.

01:04:26.321 --> 01:04:27.789
Well, cowboy.

01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:31.869
Clear the way, you amateurs!
Chef coming through.

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:34.295
Chef with a severe case
of the saw bits.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:38.046
Tit-for-tat, only difference is
I don't need a sexy black dress.

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.086
Alright, alright, alright.

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.672
Yeah, everyday.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:45.223
Mm-mm. More wine.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:46.470
More wine, more wine.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:48.517
More wine, more wine!

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.224
Aha! Whoa!

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:56.526
Have I said how much
I love this music?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:04:58.729
I can almost dance.
Almost.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:01.816
I see you,
extremely pretty cousin.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.775
Beware, okay?
I have permission.

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:10.790
Cheers. Whoo!

01:05:13.368 --> 01:05:14.995
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Bye-bye.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.126
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, too.
You're so beautiful.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:18.457
Thank you.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.629
- Well, thank you, my friend.
- Thank you so very, very much.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:21.797
Thank you.

01:05:21.876 --> 01:05:23.276
Hey, who's available
tomorrow night?

01:05:23.336 --> 01:05:24.428
I'm available!

01:05:24.587 --> 01:05:26.430
Oh, oh, oh,
bless you, my son.

01:05:28.091 --> 01:05:29.889
Bye.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:40.900
Sweet potato stew! Yay!

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:05.883
Oh, okay.

01:06:07.714 --> 01:06:09.136
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.432
- Keys...
- In the cab, man!

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.025
Hurry!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:20.647
I want you to go outside.

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:22.858
- Move, move, move.
- Stay there!

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.818
Keep-it-handy travel candy?

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.284
Why are you different?
Why are you both different?

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.545
What is this place?

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:39.560
<i>No, you've got to understand.
I'm a psychiatrist.</i>

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:40.982
I'm neutral, I'm Switzerland.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:04.418
Look, can we just see this
is one of those

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:08.877
sort of random events that's just
deeply inconvenient for both of us.

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:10.522
Get this piece of shit
out of my sight.

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:19.845
No, wait, come back!

01:08:21.014 --> 01:08:23.938
Please don't go.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:59.301
<i>A losing soldier,
that I will never be.</i>

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:16.194
<i>Soldier go, soldier come.
Barrack remain.</i>

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:25.871
How much do you think
we can get for him?

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.676
Forget it.
He's already seen us, dickhead.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.752
So, so, what do we do, boss?

01:09:33.377 --> 01:09:34.675
Let him rot.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:04.325
Keep-it-handy travel candy.

01:10:04.409 --> 01:10:06.787
Nice.

01:10:06.869 --> 01:10:09.588
Once upon a time,

01:10:09.664 --> 01:10:14.044
there was a psychiatrist
called Hector,

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:17.176
who was scared to death of dying

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.973
before he ever really lived.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:27.690
I'm sorry, I've never
really been...

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:31.144
See, the thing is...

01:10:31.227 --> 01:10:33.070
Would you mind giving me
some privacy?

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:01.220
<i>If you're going to do it, Hector,</i>

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:03.559
<i>do it totally.</i>

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:08.310
<i>She has yet to discover
the words "maternity" or "leave.</i>

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:11.563
<i>You're in it for yourself
like everyone else.</i>

01:11:15.772 --> 01:11:17.069
You tricked me.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:46.602
<i>You hold all the cards,
Hector.</i>

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:01.822
Clara.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.494
Clara!

01:12:08.032 --> 01:12:10.455
Wait, wait,
where are you taking me?

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.535
Please, please...

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.121
Ow!

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.553
This shit's funny, man.

01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:24.473
"Happiness is being loved
for who you are."

01:12:24.549 --> 01:12:26.142
- Hmm?
- I know. That's true, boss.

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:32.524
Clara, Ying Li, Clara, Ying Li,
Clara, Ying Li...

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.272
What's this one,
it's been crossed out?

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.479
It says that the evil
you do in this life

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:41.112
could cost you your happiness
in the next.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.942
No, it doesn't.
I'm sorry, I made that up.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.777
It says happiness
could be the freedom

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.488
to love two women
at the same time.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.710
Look, look, look.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:55.629
I know the police
aren't gonna track me down.

01:12:55.705 --> 01:12:57.799
But the thing is I'm really
trying to help a friend of mine

01:12:57.874 --> 01:12:59.217
whose wife is very ill.

01:12:59.292 --> 01:13:00.760
He's really counting on me.

01:13:00.835 --> 01:13:02.553
If I just suddenly disappear,

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.346
then he's gonna come
looking for me,

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:07.175
and you do not want this man
as an enemy.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.510
Even if you're friends
with the president himself,

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.722
it won't make a difference.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:14.307
Well, it's not the president,
it's Diego Baresco.

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.315
Prove it.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:26.369
I can't.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:30.657
Wait, no, no.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.208
I promise you I know him.
I know him.

01:13:32.283 --> 01:13:35.127
- He's a friend of mine...
- Come. Come.

01:13:35.202 --> 01:13:36.875
I promise you...

01:13:36.954 --> 01:13:38.154
Shut up!

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.292
- Please.
- Why are you here?

01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:42.126
I'm researching
the state of happiness.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:42.960
Bullshit!

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.796
Oh, God!

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:53.434
I'm...
trying to find the means

01:13:53.512 --> 01:13:55.435
by which to make my patients happy.

01:13:56.098 --> 01:13:56.974
Bullshit!

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:59.106
God! Stop it!
Please, stop it.

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.105
No, no!

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.781
Oh, God!

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:08.619
I want to know
if I can be happy.

01:14:32.009 --> 01:14:34.853
This probably
isn't the right moment, but I...

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:40.110
I just wondered what your
personal idea of happiness is.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:42.357
You know, personally.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:47.362
If you want it,
you take it.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:49.694
That's very insightful.
I just want to...

01:14:49.777 --> 01:14:50.994
Would you mind if I just
wrote that down,

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:53.493
just for posterity?

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.290
Give him the notebook.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.435
Oh, God!
I don't have a pen.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:15.510
I just never have a pen.

01:15:38.701 --> 01:15:40.920
One last thing.

01:15:40.995 --> 01:15:44.420
Um, one final,
final request, I promise.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:47.377
Would one of you gentleman
mind just making sure

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.340
this gold pen finds its way
back to my dear friend,

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.220
Diego Baresco?

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:18.161
Go!

01:17:07.206 --> 01:17:08.708
<i>Higher.</i>

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:14.676
<i>With patience and perseverance,
you can climb the mountain.</i>

01:17:20.553 --> 01:17:23.978
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:17:28.769 --> 01:17:30.112
I'm alive!

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:34.909
I'm alive!
I'm alive!

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.447
I'm alive!

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:55.217
Hello, Hector.

01:17:55.296 --> 01:17:57.139
I'm alive, too.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:18:00.184
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait a minute.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:03.103
Oh, look,
you're very beautiful.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:05.227
Very beautiful but, uh...

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:08.105
Let's just, uh, dance.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:09.185
<i>Okay-</i>

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:46.772
Happiness is knowing
how to celebrate.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.404
- Hector.
- Clara, hi.

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:05.449
Clara, I got kidnapped.
Really.

01:19:05.532 --> 01:19:08.786
<i>- Is that a cut? Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine... now.</i>

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:10.166
I nearly died.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:12.749
I thought about you so much.

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:16.961
- And?
- So very much.

01:19:17.044 --> 01:19:18.796
<i>Hector, why are you
telling me this?</i>

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.927
<i>I just... What am I
supposed to think?</i>

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.883
<i>I don't hear from you for...</i>

01:19:24.635 --> 01:19:26.683
<i>Are you coming home?</i>

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:28.105
Not yet.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.932
<i>Look, I've got to go.</i>

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.690
- Oh, no!
- What is it? What?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.050
<i>Dropped the cup on the floor.
You see, that's what you do?</i>

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:38.240
- I <i>didn't</i> do...
<i>- Tell me what you want.</i>

01:19:38.315 --> 01:19:41.034
<i>I'm not part of your project.</i>

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:43.829
<i>You just have to decide, Hector.
Yes or no.</i>

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:47.078
<i>Yes or no.
I've got to go.</i>

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:48.750
<i>Do you know where
you're going next?</i>

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:51.170
No.

01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:58.552
- You know where you're going next?
- Yes, Los Angeles.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.347
Agnes.

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.676
It's a work-related matter.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:07.056
Unfinished business.

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:16.445
So... finish it.

01:20:20.774 --> 01:20:23.072
Champagne, sir?
Would you like the vintage?

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.529
Why not?

01:20:26.113 --> 01:20:27.706
Madame, the vintage?

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.078
Why not.

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:34.955
Why else do we travel
first class?

01:20:50.596 --> 01:20:52.894
<i>Sorry to interrupt
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:55.146
<i>but if there's a doctor
on board this plane,</i>

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:58.729
<i>can you please contact the cabin
crew? Thank you very much.</i>

01:20:58.812 --> 01:21:01.361
<i>Once again, if there
is a doctor on board...</i>

01:21:16.747 --> 01:21:18.670
Please!

01:21:18.749 --> 01:21:21.719
Please don't let them
turn the plane around.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:24.547
I have to see my sister
one last time.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.224
Look, uh, on a scale
of 1 to 10,

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:28.972
ten being the most pain
you can imagine,

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:30.519
where would you place yourself?

01:21:32.638 --> 01:21:34.390
Nine.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.693
I need to see the pilot.

01:21:40.104 --> 01:21:42.653
<i>She had a massive tumor
removed from her brain</i>

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:45.325
about three months ago
and the swelling is acute.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.950
- Should we turn around?
- No, no, no.

01:21:48.028 --> 01:21:51.407
But, uh, if you can lower
the altitude of the plane,

01:21:51.490 --> 01:21:53.242
it would make a big difference
to the pressure on her brain.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:56.078
- Be a tremendous help to her.
- I'll check air traffic control.

01:21:59.790 --> 01:22:04.045
And I've lived in six countries.
Can you believe that?

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:06.802
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't be concerned.</i>

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.053
<i>We will be flying
at a lower altitude</i>

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.635
<i>for the remainder
of our journey, thank you.</i>

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:14.142
Okay, that is going to make
a huge difference, alright?

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.315
Let's try and get that nine
down to a five.

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.687
Mmm.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:19.772
<i>Okay-</i>

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.650
Madame, do you mind?

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.480
If you must.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:34.408
Okay. May I?

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.676
Oh.

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.764
Do you have
any children, Doctor?

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:58.190
No.

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:02.231
My husband and I,
it was our only regret.

01:23:02.311 --> 01:23:04.530
We couldn't.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.357
But, you know what?

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.113
It was bloody good fun trying.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.699
Oh, you okay?

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:18.706
There you go. Let it pass.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:24.709
You know,
after my last surgery,

01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:28.546
I was in and out
of consciousness for days.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.973
They said I wouldn't make it,

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:34.928
and I remember the moment.

01:23:36.303 --> 01:23:38.101
I remember it so clearly.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:43.311
I was in a sandstorm
walking with all these people,

01:23:43.393 --> 01:23:47.614
our heads covered and walking
in the same direction.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:50.238
And I kept thinking
to myself, why?

01:23:50.317 --> 01:23:51.910
Why am I in this group?

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:56.703
I wasn't scared.
I was...

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.830
I don't know, puzzled?

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:03.418
And then, I heard my name
being called,

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.750
"Jamilla, over here."

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:09.462
And I looked to my right.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:12.389
And in the middle
of an open space was this...

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:15.843
Oh, it was this beautiful...

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:21.019
What do you call it,
the happy-go-round?

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:24.443
Merry-go-round.
That's a carousel.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:29.899
And all the people
that I know and love...

01:24:32.025 --> 01:24:34.153
are riding on this carousel.

01:24:37.114 --> 01:24:40.835
They're laughing and waving.

01:24:43.245 --> 01:24:45.498
Waving for me to join them.

01:24:53.964 --> 01:24:57.685
It took everything I had
to run to them...

01:25:00.721 --> 01:25:02.849
but I did it.

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.785
<i>It was my last ride,
wasn't it?</i>

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:23.248
Yes.
It was your last ride.

01:25:39.926 --> 01:25:44.853
All those faces,
all those hearts.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.775
I'm such a lucky woman.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.417
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.923
<i>thank you once again
for your cooperation.</i>

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:16.596
<i>It made a big difference,
believe me.</i>

01:26:24.346 --> 01:26:28.317
Don't take her to the hospital.
Take her straight to this address.

01:26:28.392 --> 01:26:30.736
Are you going to be okay?

01:26:35.315 --> 01:26:37.534
I'm not afraid, Hector.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:41.534
People who are afraid of death
are afraid of life.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:46.289
You have a real talent,
you know.

01:26:46.368 --> 01:26:48.336
Oh!
Not really my field.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:52.007
No, you misunderstand.

01:26:52.082 --> 01:26:54.426
Listening is loving.

01:28:09.618 --> 01:28:12.588
Of all the places
you could have chosen.

01:28:19.169 --> 01:28:21.137
This beach, you know,
this whole area,

01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:24.262
it's just...
it's changed so much.

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:27.636
Well, nostalgia is not what
it used to be, Hector.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:32.311
You've been busy.

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:34.651
Lilly!

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:40.069
Hey, baby!

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:43.068
Jack.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.074
<i>Okay-</i>

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:47.201
Okay, you've been really busy.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:51.786
Kids, this is Mommy's...

01:28:53.703 --> 01:28:55.831
Mommy's Hector.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:06.300
Not too bad.

01:29:08.134 --> 01:29:10.887
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.348
Oh.

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:13.431
Oh, God!

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:20.651
I got you seeing
Professor Coreman tomorrow.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:24.280
You owe me. That guy is on
a fast track to the Nobel.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.952
His happiness book
is going through the roof.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.700
I know, I read it.
Somebody gave it to me.

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:29.952
- I liked it.
- Yeah, me too.

01:29:30.031 --> 01:29:31.078
Hate him.

01:29:31.157 --> 01:29:32.409
- We hate him.
- We hate him.

01:29:32.492 --> 01:29:34.369
Hate him.

01:29:35.662 --> 01:29:38.040
- Hey, I saw Michael.
- Oh, in Africa?

01:29:38.123 --> 01:29:40.091
- Is he happy?
- He's gay-

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:42.885
- Are you?
- Gay?

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:45.714
No, happy.
I mean is there someone?

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:47.140
Uh, yes.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.138
- Clara.
- Great.

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.345
I may have fucked up.

01:29:54.055 --> 01:29:56.478
It's... They can't hear.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:13.158
Ah! The Indiana Jones
of happiness.

01:30:14.034 --> 01:30:16.833
Alan, very nice to meet you.

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.084
You, too!

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:21.758
Hector wants to know the secret
to a happy marriage.

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.710
From a mathematician?

01:30:26.087 --> 01:30:28.761
- Hector?
- Oh, <i>my</i> God!

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:30.137
Jack.

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.443
Hi!

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:46.570
Hey, I'm in L.A.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:49.494
I knew it.
You're with sock drawer.

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:51.788
- Sock drawer?
- That skank in the sock drawer.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:55.493
In the photo, the one you've
kept hidden from me.

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.953
That's what this whole trip's
been all about, am I right?

01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:01.457
Jesus, Clara,
she's not a skank, okay?

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:04.509
She's a psychologist.
Not to mention the pregnant mother

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.679
- of two beautiful children.
- Ouch!

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:11.095
That really hurt, Hector.
You know it did.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:13.848
Look, she is my oldest friend,
alright?

01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:15.929
What were you doing
in my sock drawer anyway?

01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:18.515
Putting away your socks!

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:22.148
Before taking care of every
other aspect of your life.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:24.321
<i>Maybe if you
didn't assume I needed</i>

01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:27.195
so much taking care of I could
get on taking care of myself.

01:31:27.273 --> 01:31:28.775
You know what
smothering is, Clara?

01:31:28.858 --> 01:31:30.952
It's mothering with an S.

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:33.906
Oh, that is the lamest
fucking thing I've ever heard.

01:31:33.989 --> 01:31:35.741
You have paid for this.

01:31:35.824 --> 01:31:37.451
Well, at least I don't make
a living making up

01:31:37.534 --> 01:31:41.084
meaningless, manipulative names
of seriously dodgy drugs.

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:45.501
Is this call as bad
as I think it is?

01:31:46.584 --> 01:31:47.710
Yes.

01:31:47.794 --> 01:31:49.091
Yes, I think it is.

01:31:50.088 --> 01:31:51.385
Fine!

01:31:51.464 --> 01:31:53.512
At last a decision.

01:31:53.591 --> 01:31:56.014
I can get on
with my meaningless life.

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:57.562
Oh, shut...

01:32:13.319 --> 01:32:15.742
Darling, sweetheart.

01:32:15.822 --> 01:32:17.995
Where is my fucking pen?

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:19.951
Oh, Diego.

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:22.037
Um, it's... it's here.

01:32:22.120 --> 01:32:24.373
Actually I've got it.
It's, um, here.

01:32:24.456 --> 01:32:25.673
Saved my life.

01:32:25.749 --> 01:32:26.796
<i>How are you anyway?</i>

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:28.627
<i>- How's things? How is she?
- Very good.</i>

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:33.136
I feel like I got
my wife back, and a lot more.

01:32:35.425 --> 01:32:38.019
What's the name
of your friend's clinic?

01:32:38.094 --> 01:32:39.391
The one who hates me?

01:32:39.471 --> 01:32:41.098
Uh, the Edulu Clinic, why?

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:44.401
I want to make a donation.
Anonymous, of course.

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:47.355
What's in it for you?

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:48.529
Nothing.

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:50.857
Good man.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:52.863
Go fuck yourself.

01:33:13.797 --> 01:33:15.140
Are you okay?

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:16.307
Yes, I'm okay.

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.520
How did the, uh,
call go with Clara?

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:24.099
Oh, so horrendous.
Terminal.

01:33:24.182 --> 01:33:25.900
I'm sorry.

01:33:25.975 --> 01:33:28.319
- You want to talk about it?
- Have we met?

01:33:28.394 --> 01:33:29.816
Oh, right, you're Hector,
of course, you don't.

01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:32.319
What was I thinking?

01:33:32.398 --> 01:33:35.277
- Right, Agnes...
- Uh, yeah.

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:36.577
I knew you were going to
ask me about this

01:33:36.653 --> 01:33:38.826
- and I thought about it last night.
- Uh-huh.

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:44.875
I have never felt so happy, really.

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:48.674
Or exhausted. I mean, the chaos,
sometimes it's out of control.

01:33:48.748 --> 01:33:50.625
But, you know,
I have a job I love

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:54.713
and a husband I love
and two beautiful kids I love.

01:33:54.796 --> 01:33:56.469
A home I love.

01:33:56.548 --> 01:33:59.518
The only real shadow
on my happiness

01:33:59.592 --> 01:34:02.562
is when I tell myself
it's too good to last.

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:06.483
And, Hector, the marriage,
whatever the marriage is,

01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:08.936
the marriage itself
is never in question.

01:34:09.018 --> 01:34:11.817
And that makes me happy.

01:34:21.406 --> 01:34:22.532
What?

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:27.208
I don't know, it's just...

01:34:27.287 --> 01:34:28.630
You know...

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:31.583
Thinking about
what might have been.

01:34:38.173 --> 01:34:39.174
What?

01:34:45.388 --> 01:34:47.561
Agnes.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.517
- What?
- Never mind, forget it.

01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:50.853
It's not even worth discussing.

01:34:50.935 --> 01:34:53.313
Oh, come on, what?

01:34:53.396 --> 01:34:55.398
What might have been?
God!

01:34:55.481 --> 01:34:58.234
How about what is right now?

01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:02.698
It just suits you, doesn't it,
holding on to a fantasy?

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:04.908
You know when you put someone
on a pedestal or on hold

01:35:04.991 --> 01:35:06.914
or to the side or whatever
you want to call it.

01:35:06.993 --> 01:35:08.415
Do you think
that's a compliment?

01:35:08.494 --> 01:35:10.622
Because it's not.
It's the opposite.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:14.175
And you know why?
Because I am not that fantasy.

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.844
I'm better than that fantasy.
I am real.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.467
I got married.

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.969
I had a baby,
and then another one,

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:22.551
and I'm having another one.

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.181
And do you think I wanted
it to be Hector there

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:27.309
cutting the umbilical cord?
No, because Hector

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:31.564
would throw up and then faint
because you're squeamish.

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:34.487
You're emotionally squeamish.

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:37.236
You really are some kind
of weird psychiatrist,

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.613
- you know that, right?
- I... Where's...

01:35:39.692 --> 01:35:44.243
Oh, I'm trying so hard here to
avoid the words "move"and "on",

01:35:44.322 --> 01:35:46.324
but, for crying out loud,
I am just,

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.832
"Oh, flag that woman for,
I don't know, 12 years.

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.913
Yeah, get back to that one
when the time's right."

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:54.090
So, nothing, nothing,
nothing, nothing,

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:56.964
then, "Hi! I'm in Africa.
See you Monday."

01:35:57.043 --> 01:35:59.443
I mean, I'm just some kind of
box you had to check, aren't I?

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:01.097
No...

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:15.729
I did love you, Hector.

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:23.695
But I love Alan now.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:27.783
Guess what?

01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:31.711
Whatever it is you think
you're in love with...

01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:33.709
it's not me.

01:37:02.984 --> 01:37:06.204
I know what you're thinking,
how much do researchers make?

01:37:07.989 --> 01:37:09.991
Everything in this world
is going up...

01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:15.130
yet happiness is going down.

01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:18.299
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear.

01:37:18.374 --> 01:37:22.254
How many of us, I wonder,
can recall

01:37:22.337 --> 01:37:27.264
a childhood moment
when we experienced happiness

01:37:27.342 --> 01:37:29.094
<i>as</i> a state of being?

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:32.932
That single moment
of untarnished joy.

01:37:33.014 --> 01:37:39.647
That moment when everything
in our world inside and out...

01:37:41.314 --> 01:37:43.863
was alright.

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:47.161
Everything was alright.

01:37:51.032 --> 01:37:54.206
But, now, we become
a colony of adults

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:57.585
and everything is all wrong
all the time.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:03.469
It's <i>as</i> if we were on a quest
to get it back,

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:06.718
and yet the more we focus
on our own personal happiness,

01:38:06.798 --> 01:38:08.721
the more it eludes us.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:12.395
In fact, it's only when
we are otherwise engaged,

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:16.691
you know, focused, absorbed,
inspired, communicating,

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:19.940
discovering, learning,
dancing, for heaven's sake,

01:38:20.019 --> 01:38:25.571
that we experience happiness
as a by-product, a side effect.

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:26.867
Oh, no.

01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:28.820
We should concern ourselves

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.907
not so much with the pursuit
of happiness,

01:38:31.989 --> 01:38:35.334
but with the happiness
of pursuit.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:40.625
But how do we
measure happiness?

01:38:40.706 --> 01:38:43.505
Emotions are like colors, you know.

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:48.431
Difficult to explain once
but not now, not anymore.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:52.556
All those who read auras,
step aside,

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:54.729
this is science.

01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:57.978
A new frontier in its infancy,
but not for long.

01:38:58.057 --> 01:39:02.688
Functional electrical impedance
tomography by evoked response.

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:04.943
Or <i>as</i> I call it,
"Peeping Tom."

01:39:06.190 --> 01:39:10.491
My portal into the mysterious
minutiae of human emotions.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:13.289
Emotions that
for the very first time,

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:18.040
we can separate, specify
and quantify in actual units.

01:39:18.119 --> 01:39:21.043
Now, this male subject
is Japanese.

01:39:21.122 --> 01:39:23.545
Look at the abundance
of bright orange

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:27.595
around the happiness area,
verging on ecstasy.

01:39:27.670 --> 01:39:30.549
It's <i>as</i> if the brain
was smiling.

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:33.726
Cause, half a liter
of warm sake.

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:37.647
And here we go again,
same Japanese gentleman,

01:39:37.722 --> 01:39:39.850
eleven hours later,

01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:44.438
the color of grim despondency,
verging on suicide,

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.524
otherwise known
as an excruciating hangover.

01:39:47.607 --> 01:39:51.987
Ask yourselves,
is this worth that?

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:59.623
Oh, thank you!
You first, Agnes.

01:39:59.702 --> 01:40:02.672
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes, we made a deal.

01:40:02.747 --> 01:40:05.000
Off you go into
the isolation booth.

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:06.584
Helmet on.

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:09.341
I want you to imagine yourself
in three situations.

01:40:09.420 --> 01:40:12.094
One that makes you
very happy, one very sad,

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:15.222
and one very scared.
Recent memories can be useful.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:19.560
Do not tell me the order,
I will guess it myself.

01:40:21.599 --> 01:40:23.476
They say I'm a mind reader.

01:40:23.559 --> 01:40:24.776
It's a bloody lie, I'm not.

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:28.698
I'm just a good diagnostician
with an awesome toy.

01:40:32.485 --> 01:40:34.237
<i>Ready when you are.</i>

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:51.550
Out you come.

01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:58.015
As I thought,
you're an open book.

01:40:58.094 --> 01:40:59.721
Sad, scared, happy
in that order.

01:40:59.804 --> 01:41:02.603
- Final answer.
- Wow, yeah!

01:41:02.682 --> 01:41:06.357
- You're good.
- Your turn, Hector.

01:41:06.435 --> 01:41:08.108
Um, you know what,
I think I'm gonna...

01:41:08.187 --> 01:41:10.861
- Your turn, Hector.
- Okay.

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:14.452
Get over yourself.
You weren't in any of mine.

01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:16.450
Oh, right.

01:41:16.529 --> 01:41:18.327
Sit, my dear.

01:41:20.533 --> 01:41:23.127
By way of identifying
the emotions,

01:41:23.202 --> 01:41:26.627
I've assigned a color to each
corresponding part of the brain.

01:41:26.706 --> 01:41:28.083
It's pretty obvious, really.

01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:30.759
Sunny yellow, happy,
ice blue, sad,

01:41:30.835 --> 01:41:34.214
battery-acid green, fear.

01:41:34.297 --> 01:41:37.016
It corrodes you, you know.

01:41:43.389 --> 01:41:44.936
<i>Right.</i>

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:47.519
<i>Sad, scared, happy,
don't tell me the order,</i>

01:41:47.602 --> 01:41:48.945
<i>and be specific.</i>

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:50.647
It's all about specificity.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:42:01.161
- Shut up!
- Stop, please!

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:10.337
That's odd.

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:14.296
It's as if he's filtering,
moderating his feelings.

01:42:14.378 --> 01:42:18.178
Something's holding him back,
some kind of barrier.

01:42:28.768 --> 01:42:32.568
No, no, no, these are not
the emotions of a grown man.

01:42:32.647 --> 01:42:33.990
Tell me about it.

01:42:34.065 --> 01:42:35.738
He's going to have
to dig a lot deeper.

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.740
There is no deeper.

01:42:38.819 --> 01:42:40.939
<i>I must admit,
I'm a little baffled.</i>

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:45.414
Hi, this is Hector.
I think I can go deeper.

01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:47.461
Oh, fuck,
we left the mic on.

01:42:47.536 --> 01:42:48.537
Oh, well.

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:51.917
<i>I think I know where to go.</i>

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:55.469
Courage, Hector,
we're right there with you.

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.955
This is Hector,
who the hell is this?

01:44:10.828 --> 01:44:15.083
<i>I wanted to be</i> a <i>mother.</i>

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:18.420
<i>Just...</i>

01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:21.096
<i>Just not yours.</i>

01:44:22.882 --> 01:44:27.183
Clara, um, listen,
don't go anywhere, okay?

01:44:27.261 --> 01:44:29.764
Just... just stay there, okay?
Hang on.

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:32.691
Professor, can we stop?
I need to take this call.

01:44:32.767 --> 01:44:35.646
Alright.
Please, please.

01:44:35.728 --> 01:44:38.106
Uh, Clara, Clara,
are you still there?

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:43.195
- Yes, I'm here, yeah.
- Thank, God!

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:45.821
<i>Clara, listen.</i>

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:55.248
I'm sorry I didn't give you
any explanation

01:44:55.331 --> 01:45:00.383
for this insane journey,
but the truth is,

01:45:00.461 --> 01:45:03.431
I didn't really have
any reasons of my own.

01:45:03.506 --> 01:45:06.806
I didn't explain it to myself.

01:45:08.260 --> 01:45:10.854
I have
learned a lot, you know.

01:45:10.930 --> 01:45:12.523
I've learned a lot about happiness.

01:45:12.598 --> 01:45:16.478
<i>And I've learned about unhappiness.</i>

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:18.483
And the thing
that makes me most unhappy

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:21.281
is the thought that
I might lose you.

01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:29.912
And the thing that makes me
happiest is the thought

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:31.992
that I could become the man
that you would want to spend

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:33.328
the rest of your life with.

01:45:36.789 --> 01:45:38.382
Oh!

01:45:47.466 --> 01:45:49.389
I miss my Hector.

01:45:52.763 --> 01:45:56.358
I miss my Clara.

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:04.488
Hector, keep going.

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:06.365
<i>You're knocking
it out of the park.</i>

01:46:06.443 --> 01:46:07.911
Who was that?

01:46:07.987 --> 01:46:10.365
Uh, it's sock drawer,
but don't worry,

01:46:10.447 --> 01:46:11.824
I'm locked inside
a metal booth.

01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:13.875
Oh, good!
Skanky bitch.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.344
Listen, I was
way out of line, you know,

01:46:23.419 --> 01:46:25.842
saying that your job
was meaningless, you know.

01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:29.596
Believe me, nobody does
meaningless like I do, you know.

01:46:29.675 --> 01:46:31.268
I mean, that really
was the kettle

01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:33.971
calling the pot black there,
you know.

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:36.648
Oh, wait, which way is it,
the pot or the kettle

01:46:36.724 --> 01:46:39.102
<i>- that calls the other one black?
- And why</i> black?

01:46:39.184 --> 01:46:41.027
What's that all about?

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:43.982
I know, right?

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:46.192
Does it even matter?

01:46:46.275 --> 01:46:50.781
We matter, Clara.
We, you and me, we matter.

01:46:56.869 --> 01:46:58.542
Yeah!

01:47:03.876 --> 01:47:07.346
Is this call <i>as</i> good
as I think it is?

01:47:09.048 --> 01:47:11.301
Yeah, I think it is.

01:47:12.718 --> 01:47:15.221
Um, scary, but...

01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:17.815
Yeah!

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:13.161
That's something else.

01:48:13.237 --> 01:48:14.580
Which is it?
Which one is it?

01:48:17.533 --> 01:48:19.410
<i>It's all of them.</i>

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:25.291
It's all of them.

01:48:30.879 --> 01:48:33.678
It's the Aurora Borealis.
It's the Northern Lights.

01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:36.476
It's all of them.
And isn't that the point?

01:48:43.308 --> 01:48:45.527
Okay. I love you.

01:48:45.602 --> 01:48:47.525
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:49:10.794 --> 01:49:13.422
Oh! Hector.

01:49:13.505 --> 01:49:15.803
<i>You're a warrior.</i>

01:49:18.510 --> 01:49:19.511
Whew!

01:49:24.266 --> 01:49:25.866
Would you take me
to the airport, please?

01:49:27.936 --> 01:49:30.234
Warrior.

01:49:31.857 --> 01:49:33.575
Oh!

01:49:36.028 --> 01:49:38.030
Oh, Jesus!

01:49:38.947 --> 01:49:41.120
- Oh, I love you.
- I love you.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.077
- Bye, bye, bye.
- I'll ship your bags.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:45.333
Go, go. Passport!

01:50:01.929 --> 01:50:03.647
<i>Oh, Hector!</i>

01:50:04.973 --> 01:50:07.772
<i>How was your journey?
What did you learn?</i>

01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:12.482
It was amazing.
Amazing!

01:50:12.564 --> 01:50:14.862
I am so ready to go home,

01:50:14.942 --> 01:50:18.071
to get back to my girl,
my work.

01:50:18.153 --> 01:50:19.450
I can't wait to tell
my patients.

01:50:19.530 --> 01:50:21.203
<i>Tell them what?</i>

01:50:21.281 --> 01:50:26.538
That we all, all of us
have the capacity to be happy.

01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:29.961
<i>Higher than that, Hector.</i>

01:50:33.502 --> 01:50:37.507
That we all have a right
to be happy?

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:45.313
Oh.

01:50:47.349 --> 01:50:49.317
I see.

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:52.733
We all have an obligation
to be happy.

01:51:07.077 --> 01:51:09.296
<i>Once upon</i> a <i>time,</i>

01:51:09.371 --> 01:51:12.875
<i>there was a young psychiatrist
called Hector</i>

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:15.837
<i>who was very satisfied
with his life.</i>

01:51:15.919 --> 01:51:18.297
And far be it from me,
and forgive me for asking,

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.552
and I don't mean to pry,

01:51:19.631 --> 01:51:22.054
but can this plane
go any faster?

01:51:35.272 --> 01:51:37.115
- It's me, it's me, it's me!
- Oh!

01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:42.322
Oh. Oh.

01:51:42.404 --> 01:51:44.156
<i>His world was complex,</i>

01:51:44.239 --> 01:51:46.958
<i>sometimes even chaotic.</i>

01:51:47.993 --> 01:51:49.085
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Ooh!

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:51.664
Ah!

01:51:51.747 --> 01:51:54.421
And he <i>liked it</i> that way.

01:51:55.876 --> 01:52:01.053
<i>He took comfort in the rich,
random patterns of his life.</i>

01:52:02.883 --> 01:52:04.635
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Oh, mate.

01:52:04.718 --> 01:52:07.517
<i>He listened to his
patients with real patience.</i>

01:52:11.475 --> 01:52:13.148
<i>See what I mean?</i>

01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:16.989
<i>Sometimes with surprising results.</i>

01:52:17.064 --> 01:52:19.692
It looks...
it looks acceptable.

01:52:22.236 --> 01:52:25.740
Now then, Anjali,
beware the ego's need

01:52:25.822 --> 01:52:27.665
for shaping hallucinations.

01:52:27.741 --> 01:52:32.793
Huh, looks like somebody's ego shaped
a beautiful naked Chinese girl.

01:52:35.207 --> 01:52:37.460
What?!

01:52:37.542 --> 01:52:38.589
Mm-hmm.

01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:40.763
- I... I won't pretend...
- That's right!

01:52:40.837 --> 01:52:42.464
No more pretending.

01:52:42.547 --> 01:52:44.220
Right!

01:52:54.810 --> 01:52:58.565
Gotcha!

01:52:58.647 --> 01:52:59.773
I'll get you back for that.

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:06.572
My girlfriend is coming.

01:53:06.655 --> 01:53:09.249
Everything
was <i>up</i> for change...

01:53:11.243 --> 01:53:13.871
<i>including Hector.</i>

01:53:32.222 --> 01:53:39.527
<i>And he learned to love
like he'd never loved before.</i>
