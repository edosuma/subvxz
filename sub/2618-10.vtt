WEBVTT

00:22.084 --> 00:24.783
TRIPP:
His name's Jay Fisher.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.384
Known jeweler,
suspected drug lord.

00:28.417 --> 00:31.217
He own the house, Frank?

00:31.284 --> 00:33.950
Yeah. Neighbors called, said
they heard multiple gunshots.

00:34.017 --> 00:37.317
Judging by the bullet holes
in his chest, I suggest

00:37.384 --> 00:38.417
there were three gunshots.

00:38.484 --> 00:39.917
Does he live here alone?

00:39.984 --> 00:41.783
Yeah. Nobody else was here.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.017
Do not move.

01:03.984 --> 01:06.117
Hold it right there.

01:13.917 --> 01:15.451
What's your name, jackass.

01:15.517 --> 01:17.484
Johnny Nixon.

01:17.551 --> 01:19.251
CAINE:
What were you doing
on the roof, Johnny?

01:19.317 --> 01:20.584
Hiding.
From the cops.

01:20.651 --> 01:22.050
From the
bullets, man.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.984
CAINE:
I notice that blood on you.

01:26.050 --> 01:29.184
I just got this, just
now, when I fell on Fish.

01:29.251 --> 01:30.284
Right after you shot him?

01:30.351 --> 01:32.017
I didn't shoot nobody, man.

01:32.084 --> 01:33.317
Take him away, please.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.950
Okay, so I guess
you don't want to hear about

01:35.017 --> 01:36.484
what I got on one of your cops.

01:37.950 --> 01:39.217
The dope.

01:41.251 --> 01:42.517
Hang on a second.

01:42.584 --> 01:44.351
Oh, no, man, you said to go--
I don't want

01:44.417 --> 01:46.817
to obstruct...
What are you
talking about, Johnny?

01:47.850 --> 01:50.850
<i>Cubano guy... Delko.</i>

01:52.850 --> 01:55.351
He buys drugs, man.

01:55.417 --> 01:56.551
I sell it to him.

01:56.618 --> 01:58.384
That's a bunch of crap,
you're lying.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.551
If I'm lying, how come
I got his phone number?

02:01.618 --> 02:03.317
Check it, Frank.

02:06.384 --> 02:07.718
Under "D."

02:10.817 --> 02:12.883
You got this from the website.

02:12.950 --> 02:15.017
It's his personal number, dawg.

02:17.217 --> 02:19.184
Let me see that, Frank.

02:25.484 --> 02:26.584
Call it.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.750
<i>( recording ):
Hey, what's up, this is Eric,
leave a message.</i>

02:39.984 --> 02:41.750
Get him out of here.

02:46.184 --> 02:48.117
What are you gonna do?

02:50.117 --> 02:54.284
I am going to get to the truth.

03:54.084 --> 03:55.917
I was just there
buying dope, man.

03:55.984 --> 03:57.617
I wouldn't shoot Fish.

03:57.684 --> 04:00.117
So the GSR test from you hands
should come back negative then.

04:00.184 --> 04:01.684
Hell yeah, it should.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.251
I was upstairs,

04:03.318 --> 04:05.517
on the head, when the whole
thing went down, man.

04:05.584 --> 04:08.184
There was all this screaming,
and hell'a shooting.

04:08.251 --> 04:10.318
FISHER:
No, you need to get
my permission, bitch.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.851
MAN:
I'm not your bitch.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.184
What you need to do is
stay the hell out my territory.

04:14.251 --> 04:15.784
Come on, man,
put that away.

04:15.851 --> 04:17.483
We're just talking.
Well, we're not no more.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.383
Only part I believe
is the part about the guns.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.617
There was somebody else
there, man.

04:26.684 --> 04:28.550
Well, you're good
at dropping names-- who was it?

04:28.617 --> 04:29.917
I didn't see him.

04:29.984 --> 04:31.318
What a shock.

04:32.984 --> 04:35.517
Hey.

04:52.251 --> 04:57.318
His name is
Johnny Nixon, Eric.

04:57.383 --> 05:00.517
You two know each
other, don't you?

05:00.584 --> 05:02.517
What did he tell you?

05:02.584 --> 05:05.284
He told me
that he sold you marijuana.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.084
That true?

05:11.817 --> 05:13.917
Yeah, it is.

05:18.117 --> 05:21.251
There were extenuating
circumstances, H.

05:21.318 --> 05:25.151
Eric, listen to me, I don't want
you to say anything to anybody,

05:25.218 --> 05:28.717
especially Internal Affairs,
circumstances or not, okay?

05:28.784 --> 05:31.584
So you definitely think
there will be an investigation?

05:33.051 --> 05:35.984
Gentlemen.

05:36.051 --> 05:37.784
As expected, Rick.

05:37.851 --> 05:39.617
Just doing my job, Horatio.

05:39.684 --> 05:41.684
And loving every minute.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.251
Rick, Eric
has requested

05:45.318 --> 05:47.650
to speak to a union rep
before he talks to you.

05:47.717 --> 05:49.017
Great.

05:49.084 --> 05:51.318
First order of business,
need a urine test from you.

05:51.383 --> 05:52.650
That's fine.

05:52.717 --> 05:54.350
Okay, second,

05:54.417 --> 05:56.650
I need to speak with all his
colleagues and get a statement.

05:56.717 --> 05:57.851
And that will include you.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.550
That's not going
to be a problem, Rick.

06:00.617 --> 06:01.750
Okay, where's the witness?

06:01.817 --> 06:04.084
The suspect is
right in that room,

06:04.151 --> 06:07.684
currently being interrogated
for murder, Rick.

06:07.750 --> 06:11.450
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

06:13.251 --> 06:15.350
Look, H.,
I'm telling you the truth.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.383
I don't smoke pot.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.117
So somebody really did
fall through the skylight.

06:36.184 --> 06:37.584
Mm-hmm.

06:37.650 --> 06:42.784
Used my boy here
as a landing pad.

06:42.851 --> 06:44.517
Be careful of
the glass, honey.

06:44.584 --> 06:46.817
Already tore
up my pants.

06:54.417 --> 06:57.318
Hey, Alexx, how many wounds
did you say he had?

06:57.383 --> 06:59.650
Three big, nasty ones.

06:59.717 --> 07:01.784
I've got four casings.

07:01.851 --> 07:03.617
All 9-mil.

07:03.684 --> 07:05.684
Maybe our shooter missed.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.051
Might have been
what weakened the skylight.

07:10.584 --> 07:13.483
Still won't give us
our shooter's location.

07:13.550 --> 07:15.218
Neither will the casings.

07:15.284 --> 07:17.917
They were scattered when he fell
through the skylight.

07:24.717 --> 07:26.318
Yeah, you know, he did

07:26.383 --> 07:27.884
a really good job
of contaminating

07:27.951 --> 07:29.017
the crime scene.

07:29.084 --> 07:30.218
That's not all he did.

07:30.284 --> 07:32.017
Guy's a drug dealer.

07:32.084 --> 07:34.851
Said Eric is one of his clients.

07:36.884 --> 07:41.084
Really?

07:41.501 --> 07:43.900
I don't believe that, do you?

07:43.967 --> 07:49.534
Eric Delko, using drugs?

07:49.601 --> 07:51.601
No way.

07:58.767 --> 08:01.000
Hey.

08:01.067 --> 08:02.334
Hey.

08:02.401 --> 08:04.900
Can I...
Yeah, yeah, sure,
I cleared the area.

08:08.934 --> 08:10.401
What are you doing here?

08:10.467 --> 08:12.568
I just live up the street,
and I heard all the sirens.

08:12.634 --> 08:14.434
What's going on?
You live up the street?

08:14.501 --> 08:15.700
In this area?

08:15.767 --> 08:17.967
It's a long story.

08:18.034 --> 08:22.000
It can't be a bad one if it
ended up in this neighborhood.

08:23.434 --> 08:26.800
Um, I'm kind of locked
in the lab my whole life,

08:26.867 --> 08:29.534
and I'm just wondering,
could I observe?

08:29.601 --> 08:31.267
I mean, I won't touch
anything, I promise.

08:31.334 --> 08:34.634
Yeah, sure, I guess so.

08:34.700 --> 08:38.034
Um, you know what,
put these on, just in case.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.400
Okay.

08:39.467 --> 08:40.700
Where are you
going to start?

08:40.767 --> 08:43.933
Patrol said
somebody hit the intercom.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.733
You think the
killer did it?

08:45.800 --> 08:47.334
Maybe.

08:51.401 --> 08:54.800
So... this your first time
to a crime scene?

08:55.833 --> 08:58.134
Second... first by choice.

09:00.534 --> 09:03.167
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:03.234 --> 09:05.334
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
I'm sorry.

09:05.401 --> 09:07.767
Okay, just don't move,
I'm coming, all right?

09:15.034 --> 09:16.733
You know what?

09:16.800 --> 09:20.668
You may have uncovered
a key piece of evidence.

09:25.467 --> 09:28.034
Next time,
look with your eyes,

09:28.100 --> 09:29.434
not with your feet, okay?

09:29.501 --> 09:32.267
<i>( chuckling ):
Absolutely.</i>

09:32.334 --> 09:33.700
It's tempered.

09:34.867 --> 09:36.634
WOLFE:
Yeah, it's safety glass.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.867
If we're lucky, it came
from the getaway car's window.

09:39.934 --> 09:41.634
Why is that lucky?

09:41.700 --> 09:44.100
Because it will tell us exactly
what make and model it's from.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.267
Hmm.

09:55.267 --> 09:57.534
Those are numbers.

09:58.800 --> 10:02.733
WOLFE:
They're called bugs.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.434
They look like numbers.

10:04.501 --> 10:06.668
They're Department
of Transportation numbers.

10:06.733 --> 10:08.634
Oh, security etching.

10:08.700 --> 10:10.934
They tell you the make
and model of the car.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.767
Yeah, they tell you
the make, the model,

10:12.833 --> 10:14.467
where it was made,
what month and year.

10:14.534 --> 10:16.100
They even tell you
the VIN number.

10:16.167 --> 10:19.568
Here, read them to me,
and I'll run them.

10:19.634 --> 10:24.668
4800-7875-0005H8R.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.167
That's all I got.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.201
I'll give it a shot.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
Solstice Coupe.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.134
You got the R.O.?

10:39.201 --> 10:40.767
Should pop up
with the VIN number.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.833
Deana Walters.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.201
Here we come.

10:45.267 --> 10:47.100
Get off me, you bitch-ass punk!

10:47.167 --> 10:50.134
I know law! This is a case of
excessive force, I ever seen it.

10:50.201 --> 10:51.967
Help Miss Walters up.
Bitch-ass!

10:52.034 --> 10:54.034
Dee-Nasty.

10:54.100 --> 10:56.301
And I don't need no po-po
telling me what to do.

10:56.367 --> 10:57.934
Well, Miss Nasty,
you commit murder,

10:58.000 --> 10:59.900
I'll tell you whatever I want
to tell you.

10:59.967 --> 11:01.634
What?

11:01.700 --> 11:03.900
Man, I wasn't anywhere near
no murder.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.234
Why don't you try again.

11:05.301 --> 11:06.967
We found glass from your car
at the scene.

11:07.034 --> 11:10.301
Yeah, screwed up my ride,
so what?

11:10.367 --> 11:13.201
So you shot Jay Fisher,
and took off in that ride.

11:22.501 --> 11:23.967
Man, you leanin'.

11:24.034 --> 11:25.501
I ain't shot nobody.

11:25.568 --> 11:27.534
You want to tell me
about that cut on your lip?

11:28.568 --> 11:31.000
Got it off my grill.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.134
Your grill?

11:34.634 --> 11:36.234
What about the scratches?

11:37.833 --> 11:40.000
Whatever, man,
I ain't got nothing to hide.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.833
Fish sold me this grill,
then decided he wanted it back.

11:42.900 --> 11:45.467
Man, I already
gave you five G's.

11:45.534 --> 11:47.000
Do I look like
I do layaway?

11:47.067 --> 11:48.601
Huh?

11:48.668 --> 11:50.100
You're gonna give me
my full ten.

11:50.167 --> 11:51.601
Come on, Fish,
quit trippin'.

11:51.668 --> 11:54.900
How about I... rush it to
you in a couple of weeks?

11:56.568 --> 11:58.668
You're gonna rush it to me
in a couple...
Yeah, baby, what.

11:58.733 --> 12:00.167
Is that what you're
gonna do for me, baby?

12:00.234 --> 12:01.833
I don't think so.

12:04.568 --> 12:06.568
No guns involved?

12:06.634 --> 12:07.900
Straight-up truth, man.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.568
I left, he was alive.

12:09.634 --> 12:11.568
Pissed, but alive.

12:11.634 --> 12:13.934
Then you won't mind me
checking your car, will you?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.167
Under the seat?

12:28.601 --> 12:30.267
That's not too sly, sweetheart.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.334
We had 9-mil casings
at the scene.

12:32.401 --> 12:33.601
You want to
explain that?

12:33.668 --> 12:37.334
Look, T.J. Hooker,
it's a coincidence.

12:37.401 --> 12:39.733
No such thing.

12:43.034 --> 12:44.967
Did you hear anything
about Delko?
Not yet.

12:45.034 --> 12:46.833
Is IAB investigating?

12:50.334 --> 12:51.733
I believe they are.

12:55.201 --> 12:57.301
Ms. Duquesne, Mr. Wolfe.

12:57.367 --> 13:00.467
Sure you've heard about the
investigation into Eric Delko.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.167
Protocol dictates
I interview his colleagues.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.934
Dude, are those rolling papers
in there?

13:10.634 --> 13:13.167
They're not mine.

13:14.434 --> 13:15.900
What if we refuse?

13:15.967 --> 13:17.733
You're either a witness
or a suspect.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.067
It's kind of brutal, isn't it?

13:19.134 --> 13:20.367
I mean, we're all cops here.

13:20.434 --> 13:22.100
That is why it should be brutal.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.401
As moral governors
of the community,

13:24.467 --> 13:26.234
we should be held
to a higher standard.

13:28.067 --> 13:29.267
Who wants to go first?

13:29.334 --> 13:30.301
Um...

13:48.230 --> 13:51.031
You know what to do with that.

13:55.631 --> 13:57.064
<i>STETLER:
Have you ever seen Eric Delko</i>

13:57.130 --> 13:59.464
<i>smoke marijuana
or use any other kind of drug?</i>

13:59.531 --> 14:00.631
No.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.930
Have you ever seen him

14:02.997 --> 14:03.930
or any other kind of drug?

14:03.997 --> 14:04.997
No.

14:05.064 --> 14:06.331
Have you ever seen
Eric Delko

14:06.397 --> 14:08.431
with any drug paraphernalia
of any kind?

14:08.497 --> 14:09.397
No.

14:20.897 --> 14:22.598
<i>STETLER:

14:22.664 --> 14:25.064

No.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.364
No.

14:30.431 --> 14:32.097
Have you ever seen him
with any drug paraphernalia?

14:35.863 --> 14:36.797
I've, um...

14:39.431 --> 14:41.631
I've never seen him
with anything illegal.

14:44.097 --> 14:45.531
Not everything's illegal.

14:45.598 --> 14:47.698
A pipe-- that's legal.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.231
Certain syringes--
they're not.

14:50.297 --> 14:52.431
What'd you see him with?

14:54.264 --> 14:57.531
Need I remind you
we are under oath here?

14:57.598 --> 14:58.564
I know.

14:58.631 --> 15:01.297
Then what did
you see him with?

15:05.863 --> 15:08.030
Rolling papers.

15:08.097 --> 15:09.863
Now, what did you think
they were for?

15:10.897 --> 15:12.598
Tobacco.

15:12.664 --> 15:16.030
Have you ever known Eric Delko
to smoke cigarettes?

15:17.730 --> 15:18.897
No.

15:18.964 --> 15:20.797
Then you didn't think
they were for tobacco.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.331
Hey, Jim, did you test the 9-mil
from the girl's car yet?

15:33.397 --> 15:34.997
Nope, not yet.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.997
Why not?

15:37.064 --> 15:39.897
Because I'm organizing
the firearms locker.

15:41.164 --> 15:43.698
Markham, do you know
what this case is about?

15:43.763 --> 15:47.297
It's about test firing
the confiscated weapon,

15:47.364 --> 15:49.364
then comparing
the test rounds

15:49.431 --> 15:52.064
to the 9-mil bullets

15:52.130 --> 15:54.497
collected from your victim.

15:55.531 --> 15:58.064
Actually, it's about a homicide.

15:58.130 --> 16:00.364
Right.

16:00.431 --> 16:03.130
Dope dealer shot dope dealer.

16:03.197 --> 16:05.231
Come on,
it's a victimless crime.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.964
It's about a man,
a citizen of Miami,

16:08.030 --> 16:09.531
who was found dead in his home.

16:09.598 --> 16:11.297
And maybe he made some
mistakes in his life,

16:11.364 --> 16:13.130
but it's not for
you to judge.

16:13.197 --> 16:14.130
And that is what

16:14.197 --> 16:15.331
this crime is about,

16:15.397 --> 16:17.030
and that is why
I'm taking back my lab.

16:18.897 --> 16:20.397
What?

16:20.464 --> 16:23.397
I mean, you can't fire
a county employee, Calleigh.

16:23.464 --> 16:25.564
No, but I can have
you transferred.

16:49.598 --> 16:51.030
Hey.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.030
No match.

16:53.097 --> 16:55.364
So Miss Dee-Nasty's
not our shooter.

16:55.431 --> 16:58.464
And Johnny's hands
tested negative for GSR.

16:58.531 --> 17:00.631
So that means somebody else
had to be there.

17:00.698 --> 17:02.464
I'm going to do
a reconstruction.

17:02.531 --> 17:03.631
Are those the
crime scene photos?

17:03.698 --> 17:05.698
Yeah. Just picked 'em up.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.896
What's wrong
with your photos?

17:13.930 --> 17:15.097
What do you mean?

17:15.164 --> 17:16.631
They're out of focus.

17:19.531 --> 17:21.664
Something must be wrong
with my camera.

17:21.730 --> 17:23.797
Is your eye okay?

17:24.829 --> 17:26.598
Yeah, it's fine.

17:26.664 --> 17:27.997
Don't lie to me.

17:28.064 --> 17:31.497
Calleigh, I'm fine.

17:31.564 --> 17:34.097
I think I got to get
a new camera, though.

17:34.164 --> 17:35.698
You know what I think?

17:36.897 --> 17:39.397
You should see a doctor.

17:48.897 --> 17:52.164
I assume I got this house call
because you don't want

17:52.231 --> 17:56.598
an emergency eye exam
on your county medical record.

17:56.664 --> 17:57.930
Well, you never know

17:57.997 --> 17:59.664
what some county doctor
will come up with.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.631
It's probably
just some pinkeye.

18:01.698 --> 18:03.464
Pinkeye, huh?

18:03.531 --> 18:05.997
In the same eye
you had a big rusty-ass nail

18:06.064 --> 18:07.964
sticking out of
two weeks ago?

18:08.030 --> 18:08.964
You have a diagnosis?

18:09.030 --> 18:10.364
Yeah. You've got
an infection.

18:10.431 --> 18:11.964
An infection.

18:12.030 --> 18:13.197
That's not a big deal, right?

18:14.564 --> 18:17.997
Infection could be a sign
of something more serious.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.331
How are you feeling?

18:20.397 --> 18:22.631
You got any headaches?

18:23.664 --> 18:24.797
No.

18:24.863 --> 18:26.631
What about your vision?

18:26.698 --> 18:30.698
Cloudiness, sensitivity
to light, dark spots?

18:31.730 --> 18:33.264
No, no.

18:34.730 --> 18:38.497
Ryan, you need to see
an ophthalmologist.

18:38.564 --> 18:40.364
I know a good one.

18:41.397 --> 18:43.397
If it was something...

18:46.030 --> 18:48.030
...I'd lose my job, wouldn't I?

18:49.897 --> 18:52.331
Sweetie... right now,
you need to be worried

18:52.397 --> 18:54.264
about losing your eyesight.

18:55.297 --> 18:58.464
More antibiotics.

18:58.531 --> 19:00.497
And I need you to take them
for the full two weeks.

19:00.564 --> 19:04.097
None of this "I feel better
so I'm going to stop" thing.

19:04.164 --> 19:05.698
Thank you, Alexx.

19:07.197 --> 19:08.531
I'm not done.

19:09.897 --> 19:13.397
Promise you'll make
an appointment.

19:14.863 --> 19:16.297
Yes.

19:24.097 --> 19:26.830
Bob here's not getting
any lighter.

19:26.897 --> 19:27.830
That's okay.

19:27.897 --> 19:29.297
You can put him down.

19:29.364 --> 19:30.964
Which way do I face him?

19:31.030 --> 19:32.364
Well, that's what we
need to figure out.

19:32.431 --> 19:33.364
Alexx found

19:33.431 --> 19:35.164
two 9-mil rounds in the body,

19:35.231 --> 19:37.097
but the last one
was a through-and-through.

19:37.164 --> 19:39.297
That's the one that will tell us
where the shooter stood?

19:39.364 --> 19:42.331
Exactly, but first, we need to
find out where the victim stood.

19:42.397 --> 19:45.264
So if you turn on the laser
in his back...

20:13.763 --> 20:16.097
It's a .45 caliber.

20:16.164 --> 20:19.030
Thought you said all the other
bullets and casings were, uh...

20:19.097 --> 20:20.164
9-mil.

20:20.231 --> 20:21.598
I did.

20:21.664 --> 20:22.830
We got two guns.

20:22.897 --> 20:24.397
We got two shooters.

20:30.797 --> 20:31.930
Could be anywhere

20:31.997 --> 20:33.497
along that line
all the way to the window.

20:41.331 --> 20:44.030
DUQUESNE:
Someone was standing out here.

20:50.097 --> 20:53.863
And we may have prints.

20:54.997 --> 20:56.730
DUQUESNE:
This may be our killer.

20:58.531 --> 21:00.564
Nothing in Florida.

21:00.631 --> 21:02.397
I'll go national.

21:07.097 --> 21:10.030
CAINE:
Duane "Bull" Merrick.

21:10.097 --> 21:11.664
California address.

21:11.730 --> 21:12.863
He's far from home.

21:12.930 --> 21:14.664
Yes, so he's got
to stay somewhere.

21:14.763 --> 21:16.030
I'll run his credit cards.

21:16.097 --> 21:17.431
Do that, please.

21:39.197 --> 21:40.497
What the hell?

21:41.730 --> 21:43.698
TRIPP:
Cameras, maps, guns...

21:43.763 --> 21:45.464
Oh, my.

21:45.531 --> 21:46.730
So, what's this all about?

21:46.797 --> 21:48.763
TRIPP:
He's got a .45 here.

21:48.830 --> 21:50.863
What are you,
some sort of a stalker?

21:50.930 --> 21:52.231
He's a bounty
hunter, Frank.

21:52.297 --> 21:53.264
Isn't that
right, friend?

21:53.331 --> 21:54.698
Card-carrying.

21:54.763 --> 21:56.431
What was the price on Fisher?

21:56.497 --> 21:57.598
Fisher who?

21:57.664 --> 21:58.564
The man you killed
this morning.

21:58.631 --> 22:00.064
What was his price?

22:01.598 --> 22:03.331
Easy enough to find out.

22:03.397 --> 22:04.897
I'll run Fisher's warrants.

22:10.464 --> 22:11.863
You got no right
to look at those.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.264
TRIPP:
Actually, we do.

22:13.331 --> 22:15.264
This is a murder investigation.

22:15.331 --> 22:17.698
I notice that you have plenty
of photographs of Mr. Fisher.

22:17.763 --> 22:19.997
If I was trying
to catch him for bounty,

22:20.064 --> 22:21.397
why would I kill him?

22:22.763 --> 22:25.763
Because maybe he didn't want
to get caught.

22:43.564 --> 22:45.897
What are you doing?

22:45.964 --> 22:47.164
Looking at
the surveillance photos

22:47.231 --> 22:48.331
from the bounty hunter.

22:48.397 --> 22:50.097
See if I can find
anything to nail him.

22:50.164 --> 22:52.431
Doesn't his .45 match
the through-and-through bullet?

22:52.497 --> 22:54.930
Yeah, but that wasn't
the bullet that killed Fisher.

22:54.997 --> 22:56.664
The two 9-mil rounds did.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.631
So we only have him
for attempted homicide.

22:58.698 --> 23:00.331
Yeah.

23:03.231 --> 23:05.497
Is that the crime scene?

23:05.564 --> 23:08.364
Yeah, that is.

23:08.431 --> 23:10.564
Unless Fisher wears
the same thing every day,

23:10.631 --> 23:11.797
this was taken this morning.

23:11.863 --> 23:13.664
Wait. Look at that.

23:13.730 --> 23:16.331
There's someone behind
him in the mirror.

23:16.397 --> 23:18.264
I'm gonna zoom in.

23:26.297 --> 23:27.930
Who is that?

23:27.997 --> 23:30.097
That is our second shooter.

23:32.264 --> 23:34.097
I'm a little confused.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.497
You want to tell me why
you were at Fisher's house?

23:36.564 --> 23:38.331
'Cause he's got no warrants.

23:38.397 --> 23:40.664
You want to tell me why
you're hitting me for murder

23:40.730 --> 23:43.030
when your own people say
my bullet didn't kill the guy?

23:43.097 --> 23:47.297
Bull... you were after
this man, weren't you?

23:51.130 --> 23:52.830
I want to know his name.

23:52.897 --> 23:55.698
You got a job to do, so do I.

23:55.763 --> 23:57.231
What's his name?

23:59.130 --> 24:01.197
I tell you,
you just arrest and eradicate,

24:01.264 --> 24:02.797
and then I don't get my money.

24:02.863 --> 24:05.264
Your bail jumper
just became our suspect.

24:05.331 --> 24:07.497
Yeah, my guy's been real bad--

24:07.564 --> 24:11.964
stepping on Fisher's toes,
selling dope, stealing clients.

24:12.030 --> 24:14.631
No, you need to get
my permission, bitch.

24:14.698 --> 24:15.897
I'm not your bitch.

24:16.730 --> 24:17.564
Yeah, you my bitch.

24:17.631 --> 24:19.130
What you need to do is

24:19.197 --> 24:20.464
stay the hell
out my territory.

24:20.531 --> 24:21.897
Come on, man, put that away.

24:21.964 --> 24:22.997
We're just talking.

24:23.064 --> 24:24.897
Yeah, well, we not no more!

24:29.863 --> 24:32.397
I couldn't just
let him shoot my ATM.

24:32.464 --> 24:34.364
Your jumper picked up
the 9-mil?

24:34.431 --> 24:37.863
I told you,
he's the real bad guy.

24:40.164 --> 24:43.598
And now he's our suspect,
Bull, so who is he?

24:43.664 --> 24:47.164
Your suspect, my paycheck.

24:47.231 --> 24:49.698
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to call my attorney,

24:49.763 --> 24:52.397
post bail and go catch
this character.

24:52.464 --> 24:56.331
Turns out that we're after
the same man, doesn't it?

24:58.364 --> 24:59.797
May the best man win.

25:00.341 --> 25:01.841
I intend to

25:29.627 --> 25:31.894
What?

25:31.961 --> 25:35.027
You popped positive for THC.

25:35.094 --> 25:39.961
That's a key ingredient
in marijuana.

25:40.027 --> 25:41.393
I'm not saying anything.

25:41.460 --> 25:42.994
You're not working here, either.

25:44.328 --> 25:45.894
You're relieved of duty.

25:52.194 --> 25:54.194
No, no, no, just stop.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.894
Put that down.

25:55.961 --> 25:57.961
Sir, take care
of this, please.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.328
Let's go.

26:14.294 --> 26:15.961
I don't need to be led out.

26:16.027 --> 26:19.460
Actually,
protocol says you do.

26:23.660 --> 26:24.660
Okay.

26:56.360 --> 26:58.861
Where are you
taking him, Rick?

26:58.927 --> 27:01.161
He popped positive, Horatio.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.493
I'm sure
there's an explanation.

27:04.560 --> 27:08.927
Can you explain why one of
his colleagues ratted him out?

27:12.460 --> 27:14.127
No, I can't.

27:14.194 --> 27:15.794
He's going to IAB
for questioning.

27:15.861 --> 27:18.194
He knows the way.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.027
Protocol says...

27:20.094 --> 27:21.161
I don't care about protocol.

27:21.228 --> 27:22.493
He is not a criminal.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.393
I'm not saying he is.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.161
I'm just saying procedure states

27:26.228 --> 27:28.061
that he not drive
a county vehicle.

27:28.127 --> 27:29.161
Then I will drive him.

27:29.228 --> 27:30.727
Eric, I'll meet you downstairs.

27:40.194 --> 27:43.760
What are you doing?

27:43.827 --> 27:45.328
I don't know what
you're asking.

27:45.393 --> 27:46.794
This is not about Eric, is it?

27:46.861 --> 27:48.094
This is about you and me.

27:48.161 --> 27:49.861
I don't have time
for this, Horatio.

27:49.927 --> 27:52.061
I want an answer.

27:52.127 --> 27:53.294
You want an answer?

27:53.360 --> 27:54.493
Mm-hmm.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.527
Okay, I'll give you an answer.

27:56.594 --> 28:01.794
Your name wasn't the only one on
lieutenant's list for promotion.

28:01.861 --> 28:03.560
I scored better than you.

28:03.627 --> 28:06.194
I interviewed
better than you.

28:06.261 --> 28:07.727
And I don't
know what favor

28:07.794 --> 28:12.194
you pulled for the chief,
but the promotion was mine.

28:12.261 --> 28:15.560
Now the only thing I can
do to make lieutenant

28:15.627 --> 28:18.027
is this IAB crap.

28:18.094 --> 28:20.760
And everybody hates IAB.

28:20.827 --> 28:23.061
Don't punish my lab over it.

28:23.127 --> 28:25.261
I'm just evening the score.

28:25.328 --> 28:28.094
This is a dangerous game.

28:28.161 --> 28:31.228
It's one I intend to win.

28:32.527 --> 28:35.294
We'll see you.

28:37.660 --> 28:39.460
WOLFE:
That guy, there.

28:39.527 --> 28:40.794
He's in profile.

28:40.861 --> 28:43.460
We gonna be able to use
facial recognition?

28:43.527 --> 28:47.127
Uh... let me try something.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.627
Okay, first, I need to enhance.

28:53.694 --> 28:55.261
Now what?

28:55.328 --> 28:56.827
It gets creepy.

28:59.894 --> 29:01.294
Looks like Robocop.

29:01.360 --> 29:02.794
Yeah.

29:02.861 --> 29:07.627
Faces aren't symmetrical...
unless you're Gisele.

29:07.694 --> 29:09.927
So now I tweak the left side,

29:09.994 --> 29:12.427
until hopefully I get a hit
on my recognition software.

29:12.493 --> 29:16.927
This could take a while.

29:16.994 --> 29:20.460
Okay, so,
this is frustrating.

29:20.527 --> 29:21.694
No ID yet?

29:21.760 --> 29:23.360
No.

29:23.427 --> 29:24.360
Okay, let's think.

29:24.427 --> 29:25.794
What do we know about this guy?

29:25.861 --> 29:27.294
Nothing, except
our bounty hunter

29:27.360 --> 29:28.827
followed him from California.

29:28.894 --> 29:30.861
And he was standing
in the crime scene.

29:30.927 --> 29:32.460
And so was Johnny.

29:32.527 --> 29:35.294
Because he fell on it.

29:41.560 --> 29:42.927
Take your clothes off.

29:42.994 --> 29:44.760
What? Why?

29:44.827 --> 29:46.328
Because we said so.

29:46.393 --> 29:48.594
Not in front of her, man.

29:48.660 --> 29:50.061
That's embarrassing.

29:50.127 --> 29:52.460
Delko had to pee in a cup
'cause of you, so strip.

29:52.527 --> 29:55.161
Man.

29:55.228 --> 29:56.927
Wait a minute.

30:00.694 --> 30:02.527
It's gum.

30:05.927 --> 30:07.560
There's glass in it.

30:07.627 --> 30:09.194
That came from the crime scene.

30:14.727 --> 30:16.527
Could belong to our mystery man.

30:16.594 --> 30:18.560
We were talking.

30:18.627 --> 30:21.228
And now we're not.

30:24.894 --> 30:26.894
Okay.

30:31.994 --> 30:34.261
I'll take it to DNA.

30:34.328 --> 30:35.594
Saliva on the gum doesn't match

30:35.660 --> 30:37.660
your victim, Johnny
or the bounty hunter.

30:37.727 --> 30:39.527
Which is actually a good thing.

30:39.594 --> 30:41.228
We need to ID
our mystery thug.

30:41.294 --> 30:42.694
It's in CODIS now.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.727
Start with California,
'cause that's where he's from.

30:45.794 --> 30:48.360
California?

30:48.427 --> 30:49.393
Really?

30:49.460 --> 30:50.493
Yeah. Why?

30:50.560 --> 30:52.094
'Cause I saw a car parked

30:52.161 --> 30:53.861
just down from my house, this
morning, California plates.

30:53.927 --> 30:55.427
Did you get a plate number?

30:55.493 --> 30:56.694
No.

30:56.760 --> 30:59.061
But it was a truck--
black, I think.

30:59.127 --> 31:00.727
That could help us
find him. Thanks.

31:01.594 --> 31:02.627
Got a hit

31:02.694 --> 31:04.527
on the gum.

31:04.594 --> 31:05.827
Byron Diller.

31:05.894 --> 31:09.027
Wanted for vehicular
manslaughter and DUI.

31:09.094 --> 31:12.261
Plowed into a family
with his Beemer.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.194
Probably downed ten Jack
and Cokes at the country club.

31:15.261 --> 31:17.393
He kind of looks like
the guy from the mirror,

31:17.460 --> 31:18.794
but I don't know.

31:18.861 --> 31:20.061
Something's off.

31:20.127 --> 31:21.061
Yeah, it is.

31:21.127 --> 31:23.094
Guy's got four aliases.

31:23.161 --> 31:25.927
I wonder if he's got
as many faces.

31:25.994 --> 31:27.594
Hey, Tripp, you got a minute?

31:27.660 --> 31:29.094
Yeah. Did you get an ID?

31:29.161 --> 31:30.127
Yeah, check it out.

31:30.194 --> 31:31.560
This guy's gonna
be hard to find.

31:31.627 --> 31:35.194
His face was rearranged.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.760
Yeah.

31:36.827 --> 31:38.794
I'm thinking now would be
a good time to do more, too.

31:38.861 --> 31:40.727
Guy's running from his
second murder charge.

31:40.794 --> 31:42.560
Miami's plastic
surgery central.

31:42.627 --> 31:45.261
It's bad plastic
surgery central.

31:45.328 --> 31:46.961
More unlicensed doctors here

31:47.027 --> 31:48.560
than any other part
of the country.

31:48.627 --> 31:50.228
I know one that works for cash.

31:50.294 --> 31:52.427
I thought you looked
a little tight around the eyes.

31:55.527 --> 31:57.328
I busted him a while back.

31:57.393 --> 31:58.427
He was working on felons.

31:58.493 --> 31:59.427
It's worth a shot.

31:59.493 --> 32:00.460
You got an address?

32:00.527 --> 32:01.460
Yep.

32:01.527 --> 32:03.760
I'm gonna grab Horatio.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.927
This could be
a long shot, Horatio.

32:12.161 --> 32:13.560
Maybe not, Frank.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.061
Maybe not. Make a call.

32:15.127 --> 32:16.360
Charlie-5-Boy-20.

32:16.427 --> 32:17.760
Requests two unit back up.

32:17.827 --> 32:19.927
1275 Bayview Lane,
Keystone Island.

32:20.961 --> 32:22.727
Here we go.

32:29.927 --> 32:31.727
Get back here!

32:33.094 --> 32:34.127
Damn it!

32:39.360 --> 32:40.560
Doctor?

32:40.627 --> 32:43.294
Doctor, put it down.

32:44.694 --> 32:45.961
Miami-Dade Police.

32:46.027 --> 32:47.727
Put it down

32:47.794 --> 32:50.294
slowly.

32:53.827 --> 32:55.627
The guy took my boat!

32:58.127 --> 32:59.961
Put your hands
behind your back.

33:00.027 --> 33:01.393
I have two suspects
heading southbound

33:01.460 --> 33:02.727
on Keystone Island,
in the water, main canal...

33:02.794 --> 33:03.894
I said keep your
hands behind your back.

33:03.961 --> 33:05.228
Stay where you are.

33:05.294 --> 33:06.427
I know you.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.228
They're in a MAS-28.

33:09.437 --> 33:11.437
I repeat: they are armed and dangerous!

33:19.834 --> 33:21.133
He took my boat.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.467
Tell me what happened.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.167
The guy came in,
had a gun.

33:24.233 --> 33:25.667
Took my patient
right off the table.

33:25.734 --> 33:26.968
Then he stole my boat.

33:27.034 --> 33:28.500
Frank.

33:28.567 --> 33:30.434
<i>( sighs ):
Found your
damn boat.</i>

33:30.500 --> 33:32.867
Dumped near
Indian Creek Village.

33:32.934 --> 33:34.534
What about the suspect?
No sign.

33:34.601 --> 33:35.801
Just some blood in the boat.

33:35.867 --> 33:36.834
Yeah, I just started
the surgery.

33:36.901 --> 33:38.200
He's probably still bleeding.

33:38.267 --> 33:39.601
Could be on their way
to California by now.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.133
Not if he's smart, Frank.

33:45.233 --> 33:47.200
Welcome home, boy.

33:47.267 --> 33:48.934
I need a medic down here.

33:49.001 --> 33:50.200
Bail Enforcement Agent.

33:50.267 --> 33:51.834
Got an outstanding warrant
from California.

33:51.901 --> 33:53.834
Need to book this guy.

33:53.901 --> 33:56.167
I think I can
help with that.

33:56.233 --> 33:58.200
All right.

33:58.267 --> 34:01.267
All right. He's all yours,

34:01.334 --> 34:03.068
right after I get
his booking receipt.

34:03.133 --> 34:06.233
Mr. Merrick, I'm losing
my patience with you.

34:06.300 --> 34:07.434
You should be thanking me.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.867
You got Fisher's killer.

34:08.934 --> 34:10.233
What are you
talking about?

34:10.300 --> 34:11.833
I didn't kill Fisher.
You did.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.967
Yeah, nice try.

34:15.034 --> 34:16.601
I don't know
what this jackass has told you,

34:16.667 --> 34:17.934
but I saw him shoot Fisher.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.967
I'm listening.

34:21.034 --> 34:23.934
I'm arguing with Fish,
he hits me.

34:24.001 --> 34:27.934
I'm on the ground, then bang--
Fisher gets shot.

34:28.001 --> 34:30.167
Not no more.

34:33.701 --> 34:36.233
<i>DILLER:
I see him in the window
with a gun.</i>

34:36.300 --> 34:38.434
<i>So I take off.</i>

34:38.500 --> 34:41.233
I heard two shots.
He killed him.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.766
That's it.

34:44.233 --> 34:45.667
It's his word against mine.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.667
Now, who are you gonna believe,
a felon,

34:47.734 --> 34:49.667
or someone who catches them?

34:49.734 --> 34:51.068
I will believe the evidence.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.534
Well, good luck with that.

34:52.601 --> 34:55.266
'Cause last I checked,
you didn't have any.

34:55.333 --> 34:58.300
But I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.

35:05.167 --> 35:06.534
You remember where
it was parked?

35:06.601 --> 35:08.867
Yeah, it was right about here
behind this tree

35:08.934 --> 35:10.968
because I remember I could
only see the back part of it

35:11.034 --> 35:13.467
from my kitchen window.

35:13.534 --> 35:15.001
So right
about here.

35:15.068 --> 35:17.068
Yeah. Yup.

35:18.601 --> 35:20.133
So, why do
you think he'd
toss it here?

35:20.200 --> 35:21.701
I mean, it
was really
sort of stupid.

35:21.767 --> 35:23.133
It was broad
daylight.

35:23.200 --> 35:25.233
You know, the dumbest thing
a criminal can do is hang on

35:25.300 --> 35:26.567
to a murder weapon.

35:26.634 --> 35:28.767
He was a bounty hunter,
so he was a pro.

35:28.834 --> 35:31.534
So, if he shot someone,
he'd know to toss the gun.

35:31.601 --> 35:33.701
Yeah, exactly.

35:34.267 --> 35:37.633
This would have been
the first chance he got.

36:02.700 --> 36:04.534
I found it.

36:06.234 --> 36:08.800
Now, let's hope
we can find some prints.

36:15.267 --> 36:16.834
Found the gun
where you tossed it.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.267
Your prints were all over it.

36:18.334 --> 36:21.134
Oops.

36:21.201 --> 36:23.267
It was self-defense.

36:23.334 --> 36:24.568
It was greed.

36:24.633 --> 36:27.067
You shot Fisher to
protect your paycheck.

36:27.134 --> 36:29.600
No one was shooting at you
because no one ever saw you.

36:29.667 --> 36:31.900
Not until you
shot Fisher.

36:41.568 --> 36:43.834
Who the hell are you?

36:44.900 --> 36:47.334
Come on, dawg,
let's work this out.

36:56.767 --> 36:58.334
We got a bunch of
lasers to prove that.

36:58.401 --> 36:59.733
And we got you for murder.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.834
This time, you're not
gonna get bail, either.

37:04.201 --> 37:06.600
Well, live by the sword,
die by it.

37:06.667 --> 37:07.867
CAINE:
Bull.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.800
Somebody tipped you
to the drug feud.

37:09.867 --> 37:11.568
I want to know
who it is.

37:13.067 --> 37:15.101
Didn't just tip me.

37:15.167 --> 37:17.334
He gave me directions.

37:17.401 --> 37:19.134
He led you
to Diller and Fisher?

37:19.201 --> 37:21.267
Who are we talking about?

37:23.667 --> 37:25.867
The kid-- Johnny Nixon.

37:25.934 --> 37:28.867
That makes Johnny an accomplice.

37:28.934 --> 37:30.434
That'll add some time
to his sentence.

37:30.501 --> 37:32.334
It may do more than that.

37:32.401 --> 37:36.000
Hang on to Bull
here, please.

37:36.067 --> 37:38.834
Marisol?

37:40.934 --> 37:43.967
You're Lieutenant Caine.

37:45.501 --> 37:47.167
You're Eric's sister.

37:47.234 --> 37:48.967
How did you know that...?

37:50.267 --> 37:53.434
The blonde that worked
with Eric.

37:53.501 --> 37:55.468
She saw us at the hospital.

37:55.534 --> 37:57.733
And you put it together.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.934
My brother doesn't do drugs,
Lieutenant.

38:01.000 --> 38:02.267
You know what?

38:02.334 --> 38:03.967
Let's, um...

38:04.034 --> 38:05.367
let's have a seat.

38:05.434 --> 38:07.468
Thanks.

38:13.468 --> 38:15.468
I didn't think so.

38:15.534 --> 38:18.067
He's just around when I do.

38:18.134 --> 38:22.301
About eight months ago,
I found a lump,

38:22.367 --> 38:25.201
and, uh, I started chemo
a little bit after that.

38:25.267 --> 38:27.301
I'm sorry to hear that.

38:27.367 --> 38:29.667
So, you...

38:29.733 --> 38:32.101
So, you smoke for the pain?

38:32.167 --> 38:34.201
The nausea mostly.

38:34.267 --> 38:36.733
Can hardly keep anything down.

38:36.800 --> 38:39.134
Eric sits with me
while I medicate,

38:39.201 --> 38:42.600
and, um... then he helps me eat.

38:42.667 --> 38:46.000
And without Eric...

38:46.067 --> 38:48.101
I don't know. I can't, uh...
I can't work anymore.

38:48.167 --> 38:50.767
He pays my rent, my bills.

38:50.834 --> 38:52.767
And I know that he's been late.

38:52.834 --> 38:55.834
The poor guy's been driving me
around everywhere.

38:55.900 --> 38:58.034
Deserved an award
for taking care of me.

38:58.101 --> 39:01.301
I'm not exactly, you know,
low maintenance.

39:01.367 --> 39:03.501
Instead,

39:03.568 --> 39:05.667
he is getting fired.

39:05.733 --> 39:07.534
Um, that's not gonna happen.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.034
Well, not if I tell whoever
I need to what's going on.

39:10.101 --> 39:11.401
No, it's not what I mean.

39:11.468 --> 39:15.101
What I mean is,
I'm not gonna let that happen.

39:15.167 --> 39:16.700
This is my fault.

39:16.767 --> 39:19.201
I cannot let him lose his job.

39:19.267 --> 39:22.700
Marisol, it would be
a whole lot worse

39:22.767 --> 39:25.334
to lose you.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.633
STETLER:
Horatio, this is Monica West

39:31.700 --> 39:33.434
from the State's
Attorney's office.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.900
Sergeant Stetler,

39:34.967 --> 39:37.667
on what grounds did you test
Eric Delko?

39:37.733 --> 39:39.167
Grounds?

39:39.234 --> 39:40.568
Reasonable suspicion.

39:40.633 --> 39:41.867
Based on?

39:41.934 --> 39:44.334
Based on the identification
of said employee

39:44.401 --> 39:47.101
as a suspect
in a criminal investigation

39:47.167 --> 39:48.900
involving illegal drugs.

39:48.967 --> 39:51.000
"Through reliable
and credible sources."

39:51.067 --> 39:52.900
That's how the policy goes,
right?

39:52.967 --> 39:56.201
Who was your source,
Sergeant Stetler?

39:56.267 --> 39:59.367
Uh, Mr., uh, Johnny Nixon.

39:59.434 --> 40:00.667
Let me get
this clear.

40:00.733 --> 40:02.568
Your source

40:02.633 --> 40:05.434
is a known drug trafficker
and accomplice to murder?

40:05.501 --> 40:07.501
Is that right?

40:11.501 --> 40:15.201
What about the urine test?

40:15.267 --> 40:17.267
Delko tested positive.

40:17.334 --> 40:18.800
His exposure was passive.

40:20.700 --> 40:23.334
Do you have any evidence that
the THC came from active use?

40:23.401 --> 40:27.067
Well, there is really no way
to tell if...

40:30.434 --> 40:32.067
No.

40:32.134 --> 40:34.468
Sergeant Stetler, if that's all
you have, then I'm afraid

40:34.534 --> 40:36.401
my office could never
take the word

40:36.468 --> 40:37.867
of a doper over that of a cop.

40:37.934 --> 40:39.967
Miss West, there are other
considerations...

40:40.034 --> 40:41.934
We're done here.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
I would agree.

41:01.201 --> 41:02.600
H.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.934
I want to apologize
for not coming to you sooner.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.201
Eric, you were taking care
of your family.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.867
Yeah, if anyone
can understand that, it's you.

41:11.934 --> 41:13.934
Eric...

41:14.000 --> 41:17.367
Look, H...

41:17.434 --> 41:19.468
I understand the damage

41:19.534 --> 41:21.534
this could have caused
all of us.

41:23.201 --> 41:25.134
You have my word,
it won't happen again.

41:25.201 --> 41:27.134
Good, because it can't.

41:27.201 --> 41:28.834
You understand?

41:28.900 --> 41:29.867
I know.

41:29.934 --> 41:30.900
All right.

41:30.967 --> 41:33.767
She's lucky to have you.

41:33.834 --> 41:36.101
It's the other way around.

41:36.167 --> 41:37.501
Yeah.
