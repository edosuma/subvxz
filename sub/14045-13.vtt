WEBVTT

00:01.012 --> 00:04.112
- Yeah, my man's a badass, huh?
- That's Rick?

00:04.113 --> 00:06.113
Yeah, training to be a combat instructor.

00:06.114 --> 00:08.144
He runs the course tonight to
see if he, uh, makes the cut.

00:08.145 --> 00:09.771
I couldn't run that course with two legs.

00:09.795 --> 00:11.800
[ Laughs ] You couldn't
drive that course with a car.

00:11.801 --> 00:14.207
Just face it, Paul. You
know, you're just a house cat.

00:14.208 --> 00:15.487
What does that mean?

00:15.511 --> 00:16.846
It just means that you
don't go out in the field

00:16.847 --> 00:18.225
and that you get thrown if you don't have

00:18.226 --> 00:19.533
the perfect conditions
to practice medicine.

00:19.557 --> 00:21.698
Okay, I thought Topher told you
to cut it out with the competition.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.288
Oh, come on, he can handle it.

00:23.312 --> 00:25.422
Sorry about everything
that you're going through.

00:25.446 --> 00:27.612
I'm not going through
anything. I got off easy.

00:28.009 --> 00:29.653
Scott, it was an accident.

00:29.677 --> 00:31.081
And because of that accident,

00:31.105 --> 00:33.279
a 16-year-old boy is
looking at life in a chair.

00:33.303 --> 00:35.444
Can't move his right arm
either. He was a musician.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.355
He's not gonna be able to do that anymore.

00:37.843 --> 00:40.499
Well, what did your lawyer
say about the lawsuit?

00:40.523 --> 00:41.993
I don't know. A bunch of stuff.

00:41.995 --> 00:43.813
Depositions and discovery,

00:43.837 --> 00:45.126
and I know I should care about that,

00:45.150 --> 00:46.497
but all I can think about is Malik.

00:46.521 --> 00:48.990
But hey, look, you still
have to take care of yourself.

00:49.137 --> 00:50.543
Are you going to meetings?

00:50.567 --> 00:51.686
Yeah, every day.

00:51.710 --> 00:53.450
And, no, I still haven't had a drink.

00:53.474 --> 00:55.873
Although I'm not gonna
lie, it hasn't been easy.

00:55.897 --> 00:56.762
Okay.

00:56.786 --> 00:58.128
Well, if there's anything that I can do.

00:58.152 --> 00:59.594
Yeah. I'll be upstairs if you need me.

00:59.618 --> 01:01.062
Okay.

01:03.638 --> 01:05.220
All right, everybody, listen up.

01:05.244 --> 01:08.344
You guys all know that T.C. and
Topher are still in Afghanistan,

01:08.368 --> 01:10.458
so that means that we
are short two attendings.

01:10.482 --> 01:14.198
But lucky for us, we have
a new doctor to help us out.

01:14.222 --> 01:17.478
I would like to introduce you to...

01:17.711 --> 01:19.310
Dr. Michael Ragosa.

01:19.334 --> 01:21.007
[Cheers and applause]

01:21.031 --> 01:23.023
I just got the e-mail.
You passed your boards.

01:23.047 --> 01:24.656
- Congratulations, Doctor.
- Wow. Thank you.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.662
- Congrats, man.
- Congratulations.

01:26.686 --> 01:27.863
Kenny: All right, guys,
here we go. Listen up.

01:27.887 --> 01:29.055
Sorry to break up the party.

01:29.079 --> 01:30.013
Dispatch just called.

01:30.037 --> 01:31.467
We have a big pileup on 90 west.

01:31.490 --> 01:34.163
Drivers pinned inside vehicles.
We need docs on site, stat.

01:34.187 --> 01:36.553
All right, Drew, you're up, and take, um...

01:36.577 --> 01:37.956
Me, me. I got this one.

01:37.980 --> 01:39.323
Really?

01:39.800 --> 01:42.261
All right. It's yours. Go for it.

01:42.285 --> 01:44.383
Who's a house cat now?

01:50.863 --> 01:52.480
-

01:52.504 --> 01:54.083
-

01:55.910 --> 01:58.112

02:11.608 --> 02:14.995
[Sighs] Damn it. Just lost my signal again.

02:15.019 --> 02:16.719
I'm amazed it worked this long.

02:16.743 --> 02:17.743
Yeah.

02:18.563 --> 02:20.473
Land that time forgot.

02:20.497 --> 02:21.341
Yeah.

02:21.365 --> 02:22.661
Just as nasty as I remember.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.051
Thanks again for coming with me, Tee.

02:25.075 --> 02:26.431
Hey, no problem. Don't worry.

02:26.455 --> 02:28.998
We'll be fine. I brought lucky.

02:29.142 --> 02:31.344
[Chuckles] I can't believe
you still carry that thing.

02:31.368 --> 02:33.852
Don't hate on lucky, pal. She
got me through three tours.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.550
I know.

02:34.574 --> 02:36.535
- Hey, hey.
- You must be smalls' doctor buddies.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.668
- Topher: Yes, sir.
- Riley.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.994
Topher Zia. T.C. Callahan.

02:39.018 --> 02:39.625
Hey.

02:39.649 --> 02:40.927
Hey. Fellow Irish.

02:41.173 --> 02:42.906
You boys are a long way from Texas.

02:42.974 --> 02:45.651
Yeah, so, we're here for Ali Nuristani.

02:45.675 --> 02:47.145
He was our unit translator.

02:47.147 --> 02:49.213
He has a... a heart failure,

02:49.237 --> 02:51.089
so we brought a pump to keep him alive

02:51.113 --> 02:53.868
- until we can get him a transplant stateside.
- Bad news.

02:53.892 --> 02:56.612
His wife Farrah showed up here earlier.
Said he's too sick to make the trip.

02:56.636 --> 02:58.969
They took him to a clinic
about 50 klicks down the road.

02:59.636 --> 03:00.883
Okay. Yeah.

03:00.907 --> 03:01.557
Let's go get him.

03:01.581 --> 03:03.670
Sorry. Clinic's in a Taliban hot zone.

03:03.695 --> 03:04.367
We're ghosts here.

03:04.391 --> 03:06.660
Listen, this might seem crazy to you,

03:06.684 --> 03:08.885
but Ali, he's one of us.

03:08.909 --> 03:10.017
One morning,

03:10.040 --> 03:12.489
locals brought a boy with
a fever to my cash tent.

03:12.513 --> 03:13.975
I examined him, lifted the blanket,

03:13.999 --> 03:15.006
he was strapped to a bomb.

03:15.030 --> 03:16.857
Ali heard him say a martyr prayer,

03:16.881 --> 03:19.447
grabbed the detonator...

03:20.934 --> 03:22.956
- He saved 100 rangers that day.
- That's right.

03:22.980 --> 03:24.447
And we traveled halfway around the world

03:24.471 --> 03:25.316
to return the favor.

03:25.340 --> 03:27.953
And if we don't implant
the LVAD pump, he'll die.

03:31.432 --> 03:34.283
All right. All right, let's ride.

03:36.462 --> 03:37.612
Saddle up.

03:37.636 --> 03:39.074
Wait, we're... We're doctors now.

03:39.097 --> 03:39.960
We're not soldiers.

03:39.984 --> 03:41.133
[Scoffs] Okay, Doc.

03:41.157 --> 03:42.429
The Taliban doesn't care who you are.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.665
Look, this goes south,

03:43.689 --> 03:45.677
we're all ending up on
CNN with our heads cut off.

03:45.701 --> 03:47.980
Come on.

03:51.088 --> 03:51.951
We are back. Oh, yeah.

03:51.975 --> 03:54.628
[Sirens wailing]

03:57.032 --> 03:59.122
I told you this was a bad idea!

03:59.146 --> 04:00.169
Okay, okay!

04:00.193 --> 04:01.093
Drew: Sara, what do we got?

04:01.117 --> 04:02.577
Rachel and Devin Lawson,
brother and sister,

04:02.600 --> 04:04.014
got sandwiched at 80 miles an hour.

04:04.038 --> 04:05.056
Stable, ready to transport.

04:05.080 --> 04:06.447
Man: Please! Over here!

04:06.471 --> 04:07.671
Who's out there?

04:07.695 --> 04:09.544
Haven't gotten to him yet.
We're a little swamped.

04:09.568 --> 04:10.480
I'll go.

04:10.505 --> 04:12.624
Okay, you, you're with me.

04:12.648 --> 04:14.369
Close back doors. Let's go.

04:14.393 --> 04:15.470
[Whimpering]

04:15.495 --> 04:17.701
Oh. Oh.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.379
[Siren wailing]

04:30.165 --> 04:31.700
Whoa.

04:31.724 --> 04:32.846
Okay.

04:33.283 --> 04:34.433
Drew: Hey.

04:34.457 --> 04:36.011
Faint pulse, but he's alive.

04:36.035 --> 04:38.265
Let's get him packaged up
and to the hospital ASAP.

04:38.289 --> 04:39.704
Man: Thank God! Over here!

04:39.728 --> 04:42.254
I got him. He's critical. Go help him.

04:42.278 --> 04:44.020
- Okay. All right.
- All right.

04:45.654 --> 04:47.286
Okay, okay. Stay calm.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.231
I'm Dr. Cummings.

04:48.255 --> 04:48.942
What's your name?

04:48.966 --> 04:50.928
Sid Baines. My seatbelt's jammed.

04:50.952 --> 04:52.207
I think I smell gas.

04:52.231 --> 04:54.223
All right, Sid, do you
have a child in the car?

04:54.247 --> 04:55.781
Just dropped him off at my ex-wife's.

04:55.805 --> 04:57.377
You got to get me out of here!

04:57.401 --> 05:00.555
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

05:01.699 --> 05:04.405
[Grunting] Okay. All right.

05:08.419 --> 05:09.504
Please.

05:09.528 --> 05:11.606
[Grunts]

05:11.630 --> 05:13.613
Ready? Okay.

05:13.637 --> 05:15.619
[Screams] My leg!

05:15.643 --> 05:17.212
[Groaning]

05:26.538 --> 05:29.416
***

06:09.347 --> 06:12.465
- Where's the clinic docs?
- Taliban put a price on their head.

06:12.489 --> 06:13.416
They had to scatter.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.164
Hey.

06:16.374 --> 06:19.860
Hey. Ali. Ali, it's me.

06:19.884 --> 06:21.194
- Topher?
- Yeah.

06:21.218 --> 06:23.907
You're here. You saw Farrah?

06:23.931 --> 06:24.731
Is she safe?

06:24.755 --> 06:25.922
Yes, she's fine. She's at the base.

06:25.946 --> 06:27.065
She told us where to find you.

06:27.089 --> 06:28.485
I didn't think you would come.

06:28.509 --> 06:29.627
I told you I would.

06:29.651 --> 06:31.167
People say a lot of things.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.566
[Breathes heavily]

06:32.590 --> 06:34.604
But I shouldn't have doubted you.

06:34.628 --> 06:35.633
I'm sorry.

06:35.657 --> 06:37.333
Don't be. This is T.C.

06:37.357 --> 06:38.525
I figured.

06:38.549 --> 06:40.948
Topher told me a lot about you.

06:40.972 --> 06:43.961
Real pain in his ass.

06:43.985 --> 06:45.975
Or maybe that was lost in translation.

06:45.999 --> 06:47.561
We brought you some medicine.

06:47.585 --> 06:51.558
Try to stay quiet. Save your strength.

06:52.700 --> 06:55.488
Topher, looks like they had
trouble getting the I.V. access.

06:55.596 --> 06:57.322
We got to get his pressure
up before we move him.

06:57.346 --> 06:58.588
We'll start a central line.

06:58.612 --> 07:00.096
Hey. We got a welcome wagon.

07:00.127 --> 07:01.946
- Maybe they need help.
- No, we got to go.

07:01.970 --> 07:03.115
If the good guys know we're here,

07:03.139 --> 07:03.962
the bad guys do, too.

07:03.986 --> 07:05.483
He needs fluids running first.

07:05.507 --> 07:06.075
15 minutes.

07:06.099 --> 07:07.191
Y-y-you got 10.

07:09.561 --> 07:10.968
[Siren wails]

07:11.433 --> 07:13.358
Multiple victims coming in from the pileup.

07:13.382 --> 07:14.954
- First is one of ours.
- Hey, guys.

07:14.978 --> 07:16.455
Don't worry, sweetie.
We'll take care of you.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.265
What the hell happened?

07:17.289 --> 07:18.643
He tried his best T.C. impersonation

07:18.667 --> 07:20.268
and got knocked out by an exploding car.

07:20.353 --> 07:22.367
He has head trauma, altered
levels of consciousness,

07:22.391 --> 07:24.276
and he's got a second-degree
burn on that right hand.

07:24.300 --> 07:25.933
Gonna be fine, Paul. We'll get you to C.T.,

07:25.957 --> 07:27.132
clear your neck and head,

07:27.156 --> 07:28.623
and get you some pain meds for that burn.

07:28.647 --> 07:29.605
Have someone drive you home.

07:29.629 --> 07:30.940
- I'm okay, Scott, really.
- Paul...

07:30.962 --> 07:32.609
Look, we're understaffed.
I just want to help.

07:32.633 --> 07:34.463
Better than me sitting at home
looking at my burn all night.

07:34.487 --> 07:35.793
All right, if the C.T.'s
negative, then fine.

07:35.817 --> 07:37.172
Kenny: How's mummy man?

07:37.195 --> 07:38.633
Ejected through his windshield.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.566
Multiple lacerations to his face and scalp.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.665
We lost pulse on scene.
He's been down 30 minutes.

07:42.688 --> 07:43.803
Pupils fixed and dilated.

07:43.827 --> 07:45.521
What's your assessment, Dr. Ragosa?

07:45.545 --> 07:47.655
Uh, down for this long, sounds like D.O.A.

07:47.678 --> 07:50.411
Most likely. Continue CPR.
Give another run of meds.

07:50.435 --> 07:51.826
If that doesn't work, call it.

07:51.850 --> 07:53.205
Me? Pronounce him?

07:53.229 --> 07:53.895
He's your patient.

07:53.919 --> 07:55.387
Drew! What do we got?

07:55.411 --> 07:56.876
Sid Baines, restrained driver

07:56.900 --> 07:58.571
from the head-on collision
that caused the pileup.

07:58.595 --> 07:59.905
Likely mid tibia fracture, closed.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.605
Passed a breathalyzer on the scene.

08:01.629 --> 08:02.939
Okay, Krista, Trauma 2.

08:02.963 --> 08:04.325
Rachel and Devin Lawson.

08:04.349 --> 08:06.246
The sister has head
trauma, scalp laceration.

08:06.270 --> 08:07.255
No L.O.C.

08:07.279 --> 08:09.823
Brother has facial
trauma with seatbelt sign.

08:09.847 --> 08:10.896
Vitals are stable on both.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.038
Okay, I'll take the sister in Trauma 1.

08:12.062 --> 08:13.020
Drew, I want you to manage the floor,

08:13.044 --> 08:14.020
and any new incoming,

08:14.044 --> 08:15.766
you might as well step into
those Chief Resident crocs now.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.879
I like the sound of that.

08:18.614 --> 08:23.490
Hey. I'm Dr. Alexander,
and you must be Rachel.

08:23.514 --> 08:24.515
Mm-hmm.

08:24.538 --> 08:26.675
All right, so tell me,
what happened tonight?

08:26.699 --> 08:28.863
My brother and I are moving
to Orlando from Hondo.

08:28.887 --> 08:31.028
Hondo? Is that a real place?

08:31.052 --> 08:33.226
Two stoplight town down I-90.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.118
Guy in front of us slams on his brakes.

08:35.142 --> 08:36.618
I hit him, someone hits us,

08:36.642 --> 08:38.385
and we just kept spinning and spinning.

08:38.409 --> 08:39.105
It was scary.

08:39.129 --> 08:41.143
Yeah, I know. I can imagine that it was.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.438
All righty. Let's take a look at this.

All right, you're gonna need a couple
of stitches, but you are gonna be fine.

So, tell me, who's in
Orlando? Your parents?

08:50.946 --> 08:52.029
My uncle Tim.

Devin and my dad died last year.

08:56.025 --> 08:57.911
So, I dropped out of school
and became his guardian.

08:57.935 --> 08:59.530
That's tough. You're what, 18?

08:59.553 --> 09:01.042
I was flunking out anyways.

09:01.067 --> 09:02.911
I'll just take the G.E.D. sometime.

check on my brother. Ow!

one of our best doctors,

so let's worry about you, okay?

- No. Thank you. I'm fine.

bad blow to the head,

09:22.683 --> 09:24.832
and this is just gonna give us
a snapshot of your situation.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.832
My situation is I have 80 bucks on me.

Half of that is in quarters,
and I don't have any insurance.

09:29.104 --> 09:30.308
So no tests, okay?

09:30.332 --> 09:31.560
Okay.

09:31.915 --> 09:34.569
Why don't you just let us
suture you up, all right?

09:34.593 --> 09:36.031
And I want to see what I can do.

09:36.887 --> 09:39.389

us set up for irrigation?

the transmission, brakes.

I guess it's totaled now.

- Yeah.

That's how I got my start,
too, but we didn't have YouTube.

10:27.626 --> 10:30.024

pretty worried about you, Devin.

She's dumping me on my
a-hole uncle in Florida.

[Monitors beeping]

17:17.344 --> 17:19.276
Uh... Drew! Krista!

17:19.300 --> 17:21.202
Somebody get in here, please!

17:21.226 --> 17:22.521
Oh, no. He's coding.

17:22.545 --> 17:24.416
- I can't... I can't... I can't bag him.
- Okay, okay.

17:24.441 --> 17:25.203
What's going on?

17:25.227 --> 17:26.784
His throat's closing
up from soot inhalation.

17:26.808 --> 17:28.237
I can't intubate with one hand.

17:28.261 --> 17:30.582
If he burned his trachea,
intubation wouldn't work anyway.

17:30.606 --> 17:32.298
His pulse ox is down to
84. I'll grab a crike kit.

17:32.322 --> 17:34.554
Too risky. He may be
anticoagulated from Crohn's meds.

17:34.578 --> 17:36.914
Heather, get me the fiber
optic. Paul, you're injured.

17:36.938 --> 17:39.080
We got this. Get me a 6.0 E.T. tube.

17:41.545 --> 17:44.121
Come on, come on. Come
on, come on, come on.

17:44.145 --> 17:45.906
All right, come on,
guys. Stats are dropping.

17:46.664 --> 17:48.680
Move.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.694
Okay, give me cricoid now.

17:52.625 --> 17:54.722
Okay, come on. Where?

17:54.746 --> 17:57.241
I see the cords. Advancing the tube.

17:59.793 --> 18:01.039
Okay.

18:01.062 --> 18:03.641
[Beeping continues]

18:04.014 --> 18:05.772
[Beeping rapidly]

18:05.796 --> 18:07.641
Stats are coming up.

18:08.263 --> 18:11.147
92%. Nice save, Drew.

18:11.171 --> 18:12.630
Yeah, should've never come to this.

18:12.654 --> 18:14.198
Where the hell's Krista?

18:17.569 --> 18:18.969
Hey.

18:18.993 --> 18:21.149
What are you doing, Rachel?
You're up next for C.T.

18:21.174 --> 18:22.641
I told you I didn't want it.

18:22.665 --> 18:24.814
No, you said you couldn't
afford it, but now you can.

18:24.837 --> 18:25.859
I can't, okay?

18:25.992 --> 18:26.949
Devin and me,

18:26.973 --> 18:28.403
we're taking the last Greyhound to Orlando.

18:28.426 --> 18:29.736
It leaves in 30 minutes.

18:30.077 --> 18:31.444
I'm fine, really.

18:31.468 --> 18:34.634
Well, we need to be sure.
Okay, it'll take an hour tops.

18:34.658 --> 18:36.644
I just told you the bus
leaves in a half-hour.

18:36.668 --> 18:38.810
So catch another one. Rachel.

18:39.227 --> 18:42.720
Look, I will put you both up in
a hotel if your C.T. is clear.

18:44.204 --> 18:46.089
What is the rush?

18:47.529 --> 18:48.647
Devin?

18:48.671 --> 18:51.487
Where's he going? Where are you going?!

18:51.511 --> 18:52.311
What do you care?

18:52.335 --> 18:53.742
I got us bus tickets to Orlando.

18:53.766 --> 18:55.210
I'm not going, okay?

18:55.234 --> 18:56.379
Devin, wait.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.132
Aah! Ow!

18:58.156 --> 18:59.458
- Oh, stop yelling.
- She's in pain.

18:59.482 --> 19:01.273
- Ow! [Groaning]
- Look at me.

19:01.297 --> 19:02.351
Look at me.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.295
Look at me.

19:03.319 --> 19:04.780
Oh, God. Oh, my...

19:04.804 --> 19:06.928
- Is she gonna be okay?
- [Panting]

19:07.665 --> 19:08.847
Can you tell me your name?

19:08.871 --> 19:11.327
I-I-I-I can't. I can't.

19:11.351 --> 19:13.006
Can you tell me his name? [Panting]

19:13.030 --> 19:15.949
I don't know. I-I don't I don't...
I don't...

19:15.973 --> 19:17.028
- She's having a brain bleed.
- Devin: Rachel.

19:17.052 --> 19:18.505
Call C.T. and tell Scott to prep the O.R.

19:18.529 --> 19:19.682
I need a gurney, please.

19:19.705 --> 19:23.936
[Grunting]

19:27.332 --> 19:29.676
Hey, Paul, um, I just heard about Sid.

19:29.700 --> 19:30.897
I can't believe I missed a burnt airway.

19:30.921 --> 19:33.511
Yeah, uh, Sid is stable, but
I'd avoid Drew if I were you.

19:33.535 --> 19:35.374
Well, that's pretty much
impossible. I just...

19:35.398 --> 19:36.989
Thank you for covering my ass.

19:37.013 --> 19:37.768
It was all Drew.

19:37.791 --> 19:40.008
Couldn't really do much
with my hand wrapped up.

19:40.585 --> 19:43.358
I'm so sorry. I feel responsible.

19:43.382 --> 19:44.346
I forced you to...

19:44.370 --> 19:46.928
How? You don't control me.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.559
Okay, I went out, I got
hurt. That's what happens.

19:49.583 --> 19:52.724
Krista! I need to speak with Krista.

19:52.747 --> 19:54.153
[Sighs]

19:54.355 --> 19:56.042
- Where were you?
- Drew, I'm so sorry.

19:56.066 --> 19:57.293
- I was with Rick, and...
- Rick?

19:57.317 --> 19:59.586
No, he's fine. He came in.
He just broke his blade.

19:59.609 --> 20:01.054
Okay, so what about before Rick?

20:01.151 --> 20:02.741
Your patient was pulled from a fire.

20:02.765 --> 20:04.779
Checking his airway is
first-day intern stuff,

20:04.803 --> 20:06.442
and you're supposed to be a
resident in a couple weeks?

20:06.466 --> 20:07.775
- I screwed up. I know.
- And you were pissed

20:07.799 --> 20:08.906
because you thought he caused the accident

20:08.930 --> 20:10.899
and you were wrong. And
even if you were right,

20:10.923 --> 20:13.163
we treat everybody who comes
through those doors the same,

20:13.187 --> 20:14.519
no matter what, you got that?

20:14.543 --> 20:15.205
I got it.

20:15.229 --> 20:17.398
Now, his labs show a metabolic acidosis.

20:17.422 --> 20:19.916
Be a doctor, run the labs, figure out why.

20:19.940 --> 20:20.940
Yeah.

20:23.829 --> 20:25.043
[Sighs]

20:28.632 --> 20:29.726
[Siren chirps]

20:29.750 --> 20:32.439
The craniotomy we performed
on Rachel was routine.

20:32.463 --> 20:33.277
There were no issues.

20:33.301 --> 20:35.037
Post-op imaging show no new bleeding.

20:35.061 --> 20:36.325
But check this out.

20:36.349 --> 20:38.514
Diffuse atrophy in her cerebral cortex.

20:38.911 --> 20:40.732
She's 20 with the brain of an 80-year-old.

20:40.756 --> 20:41.859
This has to be genetic,

20:41.883 --> 20:43.460
which means she's had it her whole life.

20:43.484 --> 20:45.944
Her cortisol levels are barely detectable.

20:46.978 --> 20:48.787
You know, maybe that's
why she didn't want a C.T.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.600
She didn't want us to
know that she was dying.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.873
Why would she want to hide that?

20:51.897 --> 20:52.818
Yeah, that's a good question.

20:52.842 --> 20:53.833
[Cellphone vibrating]

20:53.857 --> 20:54.962
Hello?

20:55.956 --> 20:56.947
Excuse me.

20:56.971 --> 20:58.377
Thank you for calling, sir.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.809
I wanted to speak with you
directly about your son.

21:01.506 --> 21:03.109
You all right, Paul?

21:03.133 --> 21:04.836
Uh, yeah, yeah.

21:04.860 --> 21:07.354
I mean, can't intubate, I can't practice,

21:07.378 --> 21:08.864
but other than that, all good.

21:08.888 --> 21:10.590
What you did was pretty stupid.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.500
I wanted to save the guy.

21:12.524 --> 21:13.802
That's the firefighter's job.

21:13.826 --> 21:14.898
All right?

21:14.922 --> 21:17.225
You save your patients by what
you do here in the hospital,

21:17.249 --> 21:19.358
and if you ever want to be a surgeon,

21:19.382 --> 21:22.863
your hands are your franchise.
You can't be rash in the field.

21:22.887 --> 21:24.549
I guess I got a little over zealous, huh?

21:24.573 --> 21:27.557
Yeah, well, sometimes we need
to be shaken back into reality.

21:27.580 --> 21:31.002
Look, I'm glad you're okay.

21:36.512 --> 21:37.822
Thanks for the heads up.

21:37.846 --> 21:38.704
I didn't get hurt.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.241
I just busted my blade in the race.

21:40.572 --> 21:42.523
Krista already called
ortho to get a new one.

21:42.547 --> 21:43.919
I didn't want to bother the chief resident.

21:43.943 --> 21:45.763
You busted it, huh? How'd you do?

21:45.787 --> 21:47.140
Well, I finished the course.

21:47.164 --> 21:49.336
Ropes, tire, belly crawl.

21:49.360 --> 21:52.152
Left it all on the field, including my leg.

21:52.176 --> 21:55.603
That's great. I'm really proud of you.

21:56.296 --> 21:57.478
But, Rick, just remember,

21:57.502 --> 21:59.612
the training program
only takes the top 10%.

21:59.745 --> 22:02.431
I just don't want you to set
yourself up for heartbreak.

22:02.455 --> 22:03.540
You know what's funny?

22:03.564 --> 22:05.162
I don't even care.

22:05.186 --> 22:07.456
I felt like a ranger again.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.191
I think that's worth more than anything.

22:09.215 --> 22:12.061
So, all this had nothing to do
with me making chief resident?

22:12.085 --> 22:14.271
'Cause I just I was worried.

22:14.295 --> 22:15.650
I didn't know whether I should tell you...

22:15.674 --> 22:17.913
Drew, you have to stop walking
on egg shells around me.

22:18.401 --> 22:20.802
I'm thrilled and proud of you.

22:20.826 --> 22:23.392
Your wins are my wins. Vice versa.

22:23.835 --> 22:25.210
We're a team.

I know. And I feel the same way.

I'm sorry for hovering.

Dude, you still don't let your
sister drive, and she's 37.

22:35.215 --> 22:37.169
She's a terrible driver.
Somebody's gonna get hurt.

- Keep telling yourself that.

Take it easy? Y-you could
stand to take it less easy.

23:00.906 --> 23:02.849
What did I do? Aren't you scared?

23:03.070 --> 23:04.943
- Yes.
- Then why don't you act like it?

23:04.967 --> 23:06.224
'Cause what good would that do?

23:06.248 --> 23:08.807
So I don't feel like a coward
for regretting to be here.

23:08.831 --> 23:10.577
So, you wish you hadn't come?

23:10.601 --> 23:11.768
- Yes, I do.
- Right.

23:11.792 --> 23:13.177
I mean, Ali, I want to save him,

23:13.201 --> 23:17.244
but I-I'm feeling guilty and
stupid for leaving my family.

23:17.268 --> 23:18.197
Aren't you?

23:18.221 --> 23:21.471
Yes. But I came 'cause
I wanted to help you.

23:21.495 --> 23:23.221
I wish you would stop saying that.

23:23.245 --> 23:25.291
It... it... it puts
all this pressure on me.

23:25.315 --> 23:26.237
What pressure?

23:26.260 --> 23:27.806
You're always reminding me

23:27.829 --> 23:30.227
that I-I saved you, I helped you.

23:30.528 --> 23:33.054
That you would've killed
yourself without me.

23:33.078 --> 23:33.847
'Cause it's true.

23:33.871 --> 23:36.149
Okay, but it makes me responsible for you.

23:36.173 --> 23:38.040
I can't do that anymore, Tee.

23:38.064 --> 23:39.191
I can't do that.

23:39.215 --> 23:41.769
I-I have three kids that
I have to take care of.

23:41.793 --> 23:42.946
You don't have to take care of me.

23:42.969 --> 23:46.527
You're here because of me! That
makes me responsible for you.

23:46.551 --> 23:49.418
If you die, if... if you
get messed up again...

23:49.442 --> 23:50.123
I won't.

23:50.352 --> 23:52.887
You don't know that. You don't know that.

23:52.911 --> 23:54.850
Stop playing like you're a cowboy

23:54.874 --> 23:56.604

low, run fast, don't trip.

Gotcha.

24:05.504 --> 24:06.793
Look, Tee.

24:06.817 --> 24:07.551
No. Just...

Just get him on a gurney.

and I want to go home.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.620

Come on. Go.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.897
Hey there. How you feeling?

25:06.921 --> 25:10.266
Tired. They said I can't
leave for a few days.

25:10.290 --> 25:12.976
Well, you're gonna need some
time to recover from your surgery.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.301
This shot of cortisone
should help you feel better.

25:15.325 --> 25:19.436
So, when were you diagnosed
with adrenoleukodystrophy?

25:20.179 --> 25:22.834
I saw the brain atrophy on your C.T. scan.

25:23.569 --> 25:26.916
My, uh, my pediatrician
detected it when I was 5.

25:26.940 --> 25:30.335
And my parents got pregnant
and decided to have Devin

25:30.359 --> 25:33.633
for the bone marrow transplant
I need to save my life someday.

25:33.656 --> 25:34.967
So he was a savior sibling.

25:34.991 --> 25:36.405
Then, you know, my mom died during labor,

25:36.428 --> 25:41.611
and... and he was just lost.

25:42.093 --> 25:43.535
Right from go.

25:43.559 --> 25:45.381
I'm sorry, Rachel.

25:45.405 --> 25:46.555
[Sighs]

25:46.856 --> 25:48.197
Okay, uh,

25:48.221 --> 25:49.382
have you had any symptoms?

25:49.406 --> 25:51.261
Not until a few months ago.

25:51.356 --> 25:53.659
So, why don't you ask your brother

25:53.683 --> 25:54.851
for the bone marrow transplant?

25:54.875 --> 25:56.791
I didn't think he could handle it.

25:57.571 --> 26:00.276
He's so angry at the world.

26:00.300 --> 26:03.882

Well, that's the thing.

I waited...

35:55.957 --> 35:57.392
[Laughs]

35:57.416 --> 35:58.012
[Cellphone beeps]

35:58.036 --> 36:00.350
I'm so proud of you. Power
couple right here, right?

36:00.373 --> 36:01.870
[Laughs] Let's go look at houses.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.143
I'm just pumped.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.165
What's the matter?

36:07.189 --> 36:09.025
I, uh, made the top 1%.

36:09.049 --> 36:11.274
They want me to train the trainers.

36:11.298 --> 36:12.757
Are you kidding me? A promotion?

36:12.781 --> 36:13.814
That's even better!

36:13.837 --> 36:15.212
No, I-it isn't.

36:16.028 --> 36:18.403
I wouldn't work in Texas anymore.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.127
I'd have to move to south Carolina.

36:23.213 --> 36:25.239
<i>Reporter: The death total
of the San Antonio sniper</i>

36:25.263 --> 36:26.253
- <i>is now at six.</i>
- * in the dark *

36:26.276 --> 36:27.542
<i>Police are now theorizing</i>

36:27.574 --> 36:30.248
- <i>there are two snipers working in tandem</i>
- * and I'm right on the middle Mark *

36:30.272 --> 36:31.900
- <i>attacking first respondes</i>
- * I'm just in the tier of *

36:31.924 --> 36:33.569
<i>And shutting down the panicked city.</i>

36:33.593 --> 36:37.426
* Everything that rides

36:38.196 --> 36:41.651
* and I watch from a distance, 17 *

36:41.675 --> 36:43.597
I got to say, Gwen, when I... when I heard

36:43.621 --> 36:45.657
- your ambulance got shot up, I...
- I know.

36:45.681 --> 36:48.668
* Dreams of being golden and on top *

36:48.692 --> 36:50.301
I was so scared.

36:52.894 --> 36:56.168
* It's not what you
painted in my head *

36:56.192 --> 36:58.231
This kind of thing really
focuses how you feel, you know?

36:58.255 --> 37:00.110
* There's so much there instead
of all the colors that I saw *

37:00.133 --> 37:01.428
I couldn't take it if
anything ever happened to you.

37:01.452 --> 37:04.170
I couldn't take it if
anything ever happened to you.

37:04.194 --> 37:05.760
Hmm.

37:09.725 --> 37:12.091
Hey, Paul. Where have you been?

37:12.115 --> 37:12.921
I was paging you.

37:12.945 --> 37:14.864
Yeah, I need to find Jordan.

37:14.888 --> 37:16.428
Here, let me help you.

37:16.452 --> 37:17.680
Don't, don't, don't.

37:17.704 --> 37:19.373
Paul, I-I'm so sorry.

37:19.397 --> 37:21.350
I know we haven't been
seeing eye to eye, but I-I...

37:21.374 --> 37:24.456
Stop! Okay? S-something's wrong.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.635
Here, let me, okay?

37:28.260 --> 37:31.095
[Gasps] Oh, my God.

37:31.119 --> 37:34.187
I can't... I can't move my fingers.

37:34.211 --> 37:35.588
Okay. Okay.

37:35.612 --> 37:36.347
[Panting]

37:36.372 --> 37:37.504
It's gonna be okay.

37:38.929 --> 37:41.266
* In the eyes of a
teenage crystallized *

37:41.290 --> 37:44.088
- Hey. Got your message. How did it go?
- Hey.

37:44.112 --> 37:44.989
- Great.
- * Oh, the prettiest of lights *

37:45.013 --> 37:47.085
Got the marrow. Devin was
a perfect match for Rachel.

37:47.109 --> 37:48.046
* That hang the hallways of the home *

37:48.070 --> 37:49.089
Just like her parents planned.

37:49.113 --> 37:51.900
Yeah, just not exactly how they planned.

37:51.924 --> 37:53.253
- Yeah.
- * and the cries from the strangers out at night *

37:53.277 --> 37:56.149
You think you can protect your
children. Then life happens.

37:56.173 --> 37:58.136
- I'm starting to see that.
- * they don't keep us up at night *

37:58.160 --> 38:01.087
Hey. Something else.

38:01.111 --> 38:02.661
* We have the curtains
drawn and closed *

38:02.685 --> 38:04.564
[Sighs] I settled with Malik's family.

38:04.588 --> 38:05.675
- It's over.
- Really?

38:05.699 --> 38:07.819
Yeah, gave them everything
that they were asking for.

38:07.843 --> 38:08.757
Which was?

38:08.781 --> 38:09.898
Everything I have.

38:09.922 --> 38:12.179
My insurance only covered so much.

38:12.203 --> 38:14.285
Wow. So...

38:14.309 --> 38:16.498
- So, you're wiped out, huh?
- Yeah.

38:16.522 --> 38:20.204
I am, and it's the best
decision I ever made.

38:20.228 --> 38:22.850
I feel like I can breathe again
for the first time in weeks.

38:22.874 --> 38:25.470
And it's not gonna get Malik
back everything that he lost,

38:25.493 --> 38:28.606
obviously, but it'll
help keep him comfortable.

38:28.631 --> 38:30.010
Okay.

38:31.117 --> 38:33.204
Okay, so there's something
that I've been wanting

38:33.227 --> 38:35.658
to tell you for the
past few weeks, but, um,

38:35.682 --> 38:37.618
I-I didn't think it was the right time.

38:40.388 --> 38:41.662
Ye...

38:42.365 --> 38:43.970
- Jordan, you okay?
- Ye...

38:43.994 --> 38:46.989
Hey! Jordan! Jordan! [Grunts]

38:47.014 --> 38:48.743
Help! Jordan.

38:48.767 --> 38:50.563
Help! I need some help in here!

38:50.587 --> 38:54.774
- Hey! I need help in here!
- * we all are living in a dream *

38:54.798 --> 38:56.300
And we got coverage.

38:56.324 --> 38:59.170
- * But life ain't what it seems *
- [Chuckles]

38:59.194 --> 39:01.688
* Oh, everything's a mess *

39:04.135 --> 39:07.653
* and all these sorrows I have seen *

39:07.677 --> 39:08.598
Hey. Did you hear?

39:08.622 --> 39:09.347
- Hear what?
- * They lead me to believe *

39:09.371 --> 39:10.609
- I just talked to Janet.
- * that everything's a mess *

39:10.633 --> 39:12.729
There's a sniper in San
Antonio. Killed six people.

39:12.753 --> 39:15.221
- Oh, my God.
- We just got to get the hell out of here.

39:15.245 --> 39:16.427
- Hey, Riley,
- * But I wanna dream *

39:16.451 --> 39:17.964
what's the status on that
flight? We need to leave.

39:17.987 --> 39:19.079
- Yeah, that ain't happening.
- * I wanna dream *

39:19.103 --> 39:20.286
- Why not?
- Your flight's grounded.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.608
All the flights are
grounded 'cause of the storm.

39:21.632 --> 39:22.851
You're not going anywhere.

39:22.875 --> 39:24.922
Looks like that damn chip's not
as lucky as you thought, huh?

39:24.946 --> 39:26.687
I'm gonna call Jordan.

39:26.712 --> 39:28.790
I got to get you guys inside.

39:30.752 --> 39:32.857
How long do these storms last?

39:32.881 --> 39:34.158
* We all are living in a dream *

39:34.182 --> 39:36.777
I want a stat EKG, EEG, and MRI.

39:36.801 --> 39:38.408
Send LFTS and Coags and get the...

39:38.431 --> 39:41.598
* But life ain't what it seems *

39:41.622 --> 39:44.055
* everything's a mess *

39:44.079 --> 39:50.775
* and all these sorrows I have seen *

39:50.798 --> 39:53.964
* they lead me to believe *

39:53.988 --> 39:57.635
* that everything's a mess *
