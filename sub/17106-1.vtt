00:02.319 --> 00:04.200
NARRATOR: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.240 --> 00:06.599
-But I want you to both be
prepared for the fact that I

00:06.639 --> 00:07.799
may be switching the roles.

00:07.839 --> 00:10.240
-You should stay with
us over the break.

00:10.279 --> 00:12.080
You and I can hang out.

00:12.119 --> 00:12.800
Just think about it.

00:12.839 --> 00:13.439
-I'm in.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.800
-Christmas day.

00:14.839 --> 00:17.039
Are your family seafood
people or turkey?

00:17.079 --> 00:18.760
-What?

00:18.800 --> 00:21.079
-You know, I'd love to come
down to the farm with you.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.160
-You're gonna have to go
on, because I'm not.

00:23.199 --> 00:25.399
You're better at this than me.

00:25.440 --> 00:27.800
-I think I like you.

00:27.839 --> 00:30.160
I know I like you.

00:30.199 --> 00:31.600
-He's withdrawing his
financial support.

00:31.640 --> 00:35.280
-If I have to get six jobs, I'm
staying at the Academy.

00:35.320 --> 00:38.719
-You didn't make it
into second year.

00:38.759 --> 00:40.719
TARA NARRATING: And finally,
I'm flying.

00:58.679 --> 01:02.640
THEME SONG: Take a breath.

01:02.679 --> 01:06.200
Close your eyes.

01:06.239 --> 01:10.599
Take a leap of faith
and lead the way

01:10.640 --> 01:14.560
tonight, tonight, tonight.

01:14.599 --> 01:16.560
This is my chance.

01:16.599 --> 01:20.120
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:38.719 --> 01:40.640
TARA NARRATING: There's this
dream I've been having where

01:40.680 --> 01:42.040
I'm a competitor.

01:44.519 --> 01:46.840
As soon as I start dancing, I
know it's one of those rare

01:46.879 --> 01:51.439
performances where everything
work perfectly.

01:51.480 --> 01:54.480
There's not an arabesque
I can't control.

01:54.519 --> 01:58.359
For the first time, fouettes
don't scare me.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.640
But then a knot grows in my
stomach, this sense that I

02:02.680 --> 02:06.319
could keep turning forever,
or just easily fall.

02:09.199 --> 02:13.479
And when I wake up, I can't
figure out if it's a dream or

02:13.520 --> 02:14.680
a premonition.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.800
-Couldn't sleep either?

02:24.840 --> 02:25.759
-He got me up.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.719
-You are such a pushover.

02:28.759 --> 02:30.080
Come on.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.599
-Hey, where are you to off to?

02:48.639 --> 02:50.759
I thought the city boy was going
to help with this fence.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.319
-It's our last day, Dad.

03:07.719 --> 03:10.159
-It's like the whole world could
have disappeared, and

03:10.199 --> 03:13.199
we're the only ones left.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.199
-All right, Webster.

03:15.240 --> 03:17.759
You realize at some point this
year, we're gonna want to kill

03:17.800 --> 03:19.800
each other.

03:19.840 --> 03:22.159
Let's make a deal.

03:22.199 --> 03:23.680
Nothing's getting
in between us.

03:27.199 --> 03:28.360
-Deal.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.199
[music playing]

04:21.639 --> 04:23.040
-All right.

04:23.079 --> 04:25.399
The classes don't officially
start until next Monday, but

04:25.439 --> 04:26.839
they called us back early.

04:26.879 --> 04:27.800
And there's this rumor going
around that they're going to

04:27.839 --> 04:29.800
announce the Prix de Fonteyns.

04:29.839 --> 04:30.600
-Hm?

04:30.639 --> 04:33.319
-The Olympics of dance.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.360
They run every four years.

04:34.399 --> 04:35.240
Where have you been?

04:35.279 --> 04:37.680
-Uh, the real world.

04:37.720 --> 04:39.000
-Oh, uh--

04:39.040 --> 04:40.399
-Do you remember in the
interview, when you promised

04:40.439 --> 04:41.279
coordination.

04:41.319 --> 04:43.399
-I'm a dancer, not a dish pit.

04:43.439 --> 04:44.040
-[sigh]

04:44.079 --> 04:47.399
Make me proud.

04:47.439 --> 04:50.360
-My actions are mine,
and mine alone.

04:50.399 --> 04:52.639
I am a nice person.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.480
I am a kind person.

04:55.519 --> 04:57.199
I am worthy.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.759
I am lovable.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.120
I am free!

05:03.519 --> 05:05.399
Come and collect your
graduation plants.

05:08.639 --> 05:10.399
Make sure you nurture
them like you will

05:10.439 --> 05:11.600
you your own happiness.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.360
-For the record, playing
your own music is

05:27.399 --> 05:28.680
egotistical, not ironic.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.600
-Darling, look at you.

05:35.639 --> 05:36.600
-Tash, hi.

05:36.639 --> 05:38.600
Um, got to dash.

05:38.639 --> 05:41.160
-But you just got back.

05:48.560 --> 05:51.399
-But he's Myles Kelly, Kat.

05:51.439 --> 05:53.480
Who gets sick of those
dulcet tones?

05:53.519 --> 05:54.759
-Even you, Samuel.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.160
The 14th time he complains
about no one taking him

05:57.199 --> 05:57.680
seriously--

05:57.720 --> 05:59.040
even you.

05:59.079 --> 06:03.160
-Sammy, I made you some biscuits
to settle your tummy.

06:03.199 --> 06:04.360
-Thanks.

06:04.399 --> 06:06.399
-You've been well
occupied, then.

06:06.439 --> 06:09.160
-Well, Kat, I'm the boarding
house adviser, so it's my duty

06:09.199 --> 06:11.680
to welcome the first-year
students.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.600
-Is that what you call it?

06:13.639 --> 06:15.079
-Hey!

06:15.120 --> 06:16.399
-Hey, man.

06:16.439 --> 06:17.360
-Hey!

06:17.399 --> 06:18.759
-Hey.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.439
-So how long exactly did the
"just friends" rule last?

06:21.480 --> 06:22.079
Uh, yeah.

06:22.120 --> 06:22.720
Who caved first?

06:22.759 --> 06:23.319
-He did.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.399
-She did.

06:24.439 --> 06:26.600
She did.

06:26.639 --> 06:27.199
-[sigh]

06:27.240 --> 06:28.399
Second year.

06:28.439 --> 06:30.199
-Wow.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.160
-Did anyone ever think we'd
make it this far?

06:35.240 --> 06:36.120
Sorry.

06:36.160 --> 06:36.560
I'm sorry.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.160
-No, no.

06:37.199 --> 06:38.360
It's fine.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.120
My new holding cell's just
around the corner.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.199
It'll be like old times.

06:41.240 --> 06:41.680
-Good.

06:41.720 --> 06:42.319
-All right.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.079
We better go.

06:43.120 --> 06:43.759
-All right.

06:43.800 --> 06:44.279
-K?

06:44.319 --> 06:44.920
See you.

06:44.959 --> 06:46.079
-Have fun at school.

06:46.120 --> 06:47.439
-So your dad's still holding
out on paying

06:47.480 --> 06:48.800
your tuition, then?

06:48.839 --> 06:50.240
-Yeah, it's all about clever
use of holiday savings.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.120
You don't know anything about
the stock market, do you?

06:52.160 --> 06:53.319
-Sammy.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.000
-Check it out.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.519
You're gonna be the poster
girl of second year.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.199
-Well, somehow I don't see
Abigail letting that happen.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.560
ABIGAIL (OFFSCREEN): Tara!

07:04.600 --> 07:05.800
-Oh!

07:05.839 --> 07:08.399
-Um, I put us down
for our old room.

07:08.439 --> 07:11.199
I hope that's not
overstepping.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.439
Christian.

07:13.480 --> 07:13.839
Sammy.

07:13.879 --> 07:16.800
Wow.

07:16.839 --> 07:18.759
Today we grow in strength
with every forward

07:18.800 --> 07:21.360
step we take together.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.560
Oh, this is Phil.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.680
I'll see you guys in there.

07:29.399 --> 07:33.639
-Mr. Lieberman, I believe the
vernacular is "get a room."

07:33.680 --> 07:34.879
-See ya.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.199
-You all heard the rumors,
so I'm going to get

07:37.240 --> 07:38.639
through this quickly.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.240
For the first time in 30
years, the world's most

07:41.279 --> 07:43.519
prestigious ballet competition,
the Prix de

07:43.560 --> 07:46.160
Fonteyn, will be
held in Sydney.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.199
Preliminaries are at the end of
the semester, followed by

07:48.240 --> 07:51.199
the nationals, where it will
be decided who goes on to

07:51.240 --> 07:52.720
represent Australia.

07:52.759 --> 07:55.079
The Academy and the company have
been asked to be part of

07:55.120 --> 07:56.240
the launch tomorrow.

07:56.279 --> 07:59.160
Sebastian is choreographing.

07:59.199 --> 08:02.199
-The least I can do for the new
principal of the Academy.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.120
And the international judges
will be in the audience.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.040
I cannot stress enough that we
will be representing the

08:09.079 --> 08:12.399
entire dance community.

08:12.439 --> 08:15.439
This is your chance to make
a lasting impression.

08:20.279 --> 08:24.199
No, all of them?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.279
-You're going to get yourself
in trouble.

08:26.319 --> 08:29.160
-Pheromones, Christian.

08:29.199 --> 08:31.160
Raw, masculine pheromones.

08:31.199 --> 08:35.279
-Tara, I want you
to do the solo.

08:35.320 --> 08:36.519
-I told you.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.200
-Thank you so much.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.679
I won't let you down.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.799
-Ethan will take
you through it.

08:40.840 --> 08:44.159
Christian, over here, please.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.519
-Hi.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.080
How are you?

08:47.120 --> 08:48.399
-Never better.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.840
Um, meet back here at 2:00?

08:49.879 --> 08:52.080
-Sure, that should give me
enough time to have some lunch

08:52.120 --> 08:55.759
and unpack my stuff and--

08:55.799 --> 08:58.320
you're really not interested
in my schedule.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.480
-See you then.

09:07.519 --> 09:08.200
-Mom, hi.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.240
Uh, what's going on?

09:09.279 --> 09:10.559
Some of this stuff is
actually edible.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.720
-I thought we'd have
a family dinner.

09:12.759 --> 09:14.399
-Oh, no can do.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.600
I've organized a
beach catch up.

09:15.639 --> 09:16.639
But don't worry.

09:16.679 --> 09:18.080
These little guys will
not go to waste.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.440
-You can't just waltz in and out
of here whenever you like.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.559
This is not a hotel.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.879
-[laughs]

09:21.919 --> 09:23.320
Where did you get that one?
"Mommies for Dummies"?

09:23.360 --> 09:26.360
-I don't understand what it is
you want from me, Katrina.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.759
I gave you a lot of freedom
this summer.

09:27.799 --> 09:29.519
I didn't say anything when
you threw away your

09:29.559 --> 09:30.799
place at the Academy.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.120
-Don't worry.

09:32.159 --> 09:35.120
The disappointment rang
loud and clear.

09:35.159 --> 09:37.600
Mom, we both know the only part
of me you've ever been

09:37.639 --> 09:39.080
interested in is dancing.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.440
-That is unfair.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.480
-Is it?

09:41.519 --> 09:43.200
Then why are you sending
me back to yet

09:43.240 --> 09:44.440
another boarding school?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.679
You can't wait to get away.

09:50.759 --> 09:52.759
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Same
sides, then?

09:52.799 --> 09:53.600
-Oh.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.000
Unless you'd prefer the other.

09:55.039 --> 09:57.679
It's close to the stairs, so
there is the noise factor.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.679
But it does catch
a morning light.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.120
-Good, you're both here.

10:02.159 --> 10:03.679
This is my goddaughter, Grace.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.120
She's visiting from London.

10:05.159 --> 10:06.759
I'd like one of you to
show her around.

10:06.799 --> 10:09.600
-I told her I was old enough
to make my play dates, but

10:09.639 --> 10:11.360
Lucy keeps me on
a short leash.

10:11.399 --> 10:12.840
-[laugh]

10:12.879 --> 10:13.679
I've been trying to convince
Grace to get back into ballet.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.039
Perhaps you'll have more luck.

10:17.519 --> 10:19.519
-New people.

10:19.559 --> 10:21.759
I've been under house arrest
for the last month.

10:21.799 --> 10:23.120
-What did you do?

10:23.159 --> 10:26.159
-My dad's getting remarried, and
I upset the stepmothers.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.200
And I grew up here, so--

10:28.240 --> 10:29.120
-Well, I'm Abigail.

10:29.159 --> 10:29.679
-Hi.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.399
-This is Tara.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.720
She's the most naturally
talented dancer in our year.

10:33.759 --> 10:36.000
-OK, what are you up to?

10:36.039 --> 10:38.360
-Mom's moved back to Brisbane
to be with Dad.

10:38.399 --> 10:40.480
They're trying to
sort things out.

10:40.519 --> 10:41.320
-That's great.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.159
I'm really happy for you.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.759
-And it made me reexamine how
important relationships are.

10:46.799 --> 10:49.480
I put undue pressure on myself
last year by alienating

10:49.519 --> 10:51.320
those around me.

10:51.360 --> 10:54.159
-So you've decided to be nice?

10:54.200 --> 10:55.799
-Today, I don't have
to be perfect.

10:55.840 --> 10:59.000
I just have to be me.

10:59.039 --> 11:01.279
-If I get a choice of
chaperone, do you

11:01.320 --> 11:04.600
mind if I pick you?

11:04.639 --> 11:06.200
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): So, just let
me finish unpacking, and

11:06.240 --> 11:07.759
I'll come find you later?

11:07.799 --> 11:08.759
OK?

11:08.799 --> 11:11.080
-Miss you, Sammity Sam.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.559
-Back at you, upsy Daisy.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.320
-So that's what you're going
to be doing this year?

11:18.360 --> 11:19.679
-Hey.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.639
Well, I don't want to be tied
down to just one girl.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.720
I mean, I'm in product
my prime.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.679
-And it doesn't have anything
to do with the other stuff?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.279
-Do you know it's more common
than not for adolescents to

11:28.320 --> 11:29.759
question their sexuality?

11:29.799 --> 11:30.759
It was a blip.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.120
Just forget it ever happened.

11:36.399 --> 11:38.000
GRACE (OFFSCREEN):
Hey, listen.

11:38.039 --> 11:41.600
No offense to your tour guide
abilities, but if I don't do

11:41.639 --> 11:44.519
something vaguely fun, my
brain is going to melt.

11:44.559 --> 11:46.679
Can you do me a huge favor
and cover for me?

11:46.720 --> 11:47.679
-How do you mean?

11:47.720 --> 11:50.080
-Like, if Miss Raine
asks where I am,

11:50.120 --> 11:52.039
just make up an excuse.

11:52.080 --> 11:52.840
-Like what?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.759
I am the world's worst liar.

11:54.799 --> 11:55.759
-Hi.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.440
I'm Ethan, assistant
choreographer.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.279
-Hi.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.480
I'm leaving.

12:01.519 --> 12:02.759
You can [inaudible].

12:02.799 --> 12:05.440
Developing such a major
girl crush.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.480
-Are you ready to get started?

12:07.519 --> 12:09.759
-Do you maybe want to talk
about anything first?

12:09.799 --> 12:12.279
You know, since we're going to
be working together and all--

12:12.320 --> 12:13.600
-I don't there's much
to talk about, Tara.

12:13.639 --> 12:15.320
You said that you were going
to stay with me over the

12:15.360 --> 12:17.480
break, and then you got
a better offer.

12:17.519 --> 12:18.559
-But-- but that wasn't
what happened.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.519
-You chose Christian, again.

12:20.559 --> 12:22.679
And I was left looking
like an idiot, again.

12:22.720 --> 12:27.039
So that sucked for about five
minutes, and then I moved on.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.159
So one more time.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.759
Are you ready to get started?

12:30.799 --> 12:31.759
Great.

12:31.799 --> 12:33.159
Pose into arabesque.

12:43.559 --> 12:46.600
-You should see my
new uniform.

12:46.639 --> 12:49.799
I'm seriously thinking about
shaving my head in protest.

12:49.840 --> 12:50.519
-Don't.

12:50.559 --> 12:51.440
It suits you long.

12:54.799 --> 12:56.200
-OK.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.759
Is it me, or does anyone else
think it's kind of weird.

12:57.799 --> 12:59.559
-Strange year?

12:59.600 --> 13:00.759
Yeah.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.120
-Look at this.

13:06.159 --> 13:08.519
[gasp]

13:08.559 --> 13:09.320
-Turn out, Tara.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.519
That's looking sloppy.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.360
Did you do any classes
over the holidays?

13:21.399 --> 13:25.159
-Well, there weren't many
available on the farm.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.600
-You're out of shape.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.799
-What?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.600
-Let's just go into the fouette
turns, shall we?

13:29.639 --> 13:31.600
-You totally just said
that I looked fat.

13:31.639 --> 13:32.360
-No, I didn't.

13:32.399 --> 13:34.279
Don't be so sensitive.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.480
Fouette turns.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.799
You need to be consistent,
Tara.

13:44.840 --> 13:45.679
Get on your leg.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.039
You're wandering.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.120
Do it again.

13:55.159 --> 13:57.559
-But you know that fouette
turns freak me out.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.559
Maybe we can make them attitude
turns or something?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.000
-Yeah?

14:01.039 --> 14:02.600
How about I decide that, since
I'm the one who's coaching

14:02.639 --> 14:03.320
you.

14:03.360 --> 14:03.960
-No, you're not.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
You're punishing me.

14:05.039 --> 14:06.320
And you know what?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.480
I know the choreography now,
so I'm just going to go

14:07.519 --> 14:08.720
rehearse on my own.

14:12.759 --> 14:14.679
I mean, yes, he was
sort of my mentor.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.159
But I'm not new and
clueless anymore.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.240
I danced Clara.

14:19.279 --> 14:20.559
-OK.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.799
It's day one, and we're already
talking about Ethan.

14:22.840 --> 14:27.000
-You think I was wrong to
walk out of rehearsal?

14:27.039 --> 14:31.039
-I think this year, you're
starting out on top.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.440
Which means any knock can feel
like failure, right?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.440
It's going to be tough
to not let the small

14:35.480 --> 14:37.279
stuff get to you.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.440
-Aren't you meant to
be uncommunicative.

14:41.159 --> 14:43.799
[gasp]

14:43.840 --> 14:46.320
Oh.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.720
[laughs]

14:47.759 --> 14:51.399
-There are 300 girls
in my year.

14:51.440 --> 14:54.799
I need to do something to
make an impression.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.399
-You'll stand out, Kat.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.279
What happened with
you and Miles?

15:01.320 --> 15:02.519
-Oh.

15:02.559 --> 15:04.679
You just get to know someone
way too well when

15:04.720 --> 15:06.679
you're stuck in a van.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.559
-And?

15:08.600 --> 15:11.559
-And it was incredible.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.720
We did little mini day trips
to Byron, and we swam with

15:14.759 --> 15:16.440
dolphins in Hastings.

15:16.480 --> 15:18.320
-That'd be so spiritually
transcendent.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.440
-Yeah.

15:24.480 --> 15:26.720
But we weren't like that.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.759
-Who is?

15:35.320 --> 15:37.759
Well, come on.

15:37.799 --> 15:41.519
This is meant to be a reunion.

15:41.559 --> 15:43.480
[music playing]

16:10.639 --> 16:11.759
-HI, I'm Tara Webster.

16:11.799 --> 16:15.320
I don't think we've met.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.440
You have every right to
be angry with me.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.559
I forgot yesterday
to say sorry.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.759
So, sorry

16:22.799 --> 16:24.399
SEBASTIAN (OFFSCREEN): The
soloists, join the company in

16:24.440 --> 16:25.360
the center.

16:25.399 --> 16:27.039
I want to run through
the bows.

16:27.080 --> 16:28.240
Tara?

16:30.519 --> 16:32.039
We don't need you here.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.120
-Oh, I'm sorry.

16:33.159 --> 16:33.799
I thought you asked
for the soloists.

16:33.840 --> 16:34.679
-We found a replacement.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.200
I'm sorry.

16:36.240 --> 16:38.200
I hope you can make this
more of a priority.

16:38.240 --> 16:39.360
Sorry.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.360
-Tell me you mind.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.080
I'm looking for excuses.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.159
-Not a chance.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.399
Miss Raine would be
too disappointed.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.320
Principles first.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.159
Milla, come down stage.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.600
Lean forward.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.240
-You know you gave
me no choice.

16:51.279 --> 16:52.159
You walked out of rehearsal.

16:52.200 --> 16:53.759
You'll have to [inaudible].

16:53.799 --> 16:56.240
-Prix de Fonteyn judges are
going to be in that audience.

16:56.279 --> 16:58.120
This was my chance to
make an impression.

16:58.159 --> 17:01.120
I can't believe that
you would just--

17:01.159 --> 17:02.519
-Just what?

17:02.559 --> 17:03.759
Ditch you for a better option?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.279
SEBASTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Right.

17:15.559 --> 17:16.880
-Um, I was actually--

17:16.920 --> 17:20.000
I was contemplating a head
shave, 'cause these golden

17:20.039 --> 17:23.519
locks never have to be shackled
into a bun again.

17:23.559 --> 17:26.279
But Britney ruined that
for everyone.

17:26.319 --> 17:27.519
Aw.

17:31.599 --> 17:34.079
[mutters]

17:34.119 --> 17:36.039
PIERCER (OFFSCREEN):
Pardon me?

17:36.079 --> 17:36.720
-Cat got your tongue.

17:36.759 --> 17:37.720
PIERCER (OFFSCREEN): Oh.

17:37.759 --> 17:39.680
-Get it? 'Cause I'm
Kat, and meow.

17:39.720 --> 17:44.759
[laughs]

17:44.799 --> 17:46.160
[whimpers]

17:46.200 --> 17:47.440
SEBASTIAN (OFFSCREEN): Seems
I've misplaced some of the

17:47.480 --> 17:48.640
first years.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.359
-Uh, Lulu and Daisy, both
sick with gastro.

17:51.400 --> 17:52.680
-Keep up, girls.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.079
keep up.

17:56.079 --> 17:56.480
Wonderful.

17:56.519 --> 17:57.640
[groaning]

17:57.680 --> 18:00.079
-The corps de ballet is
dropping like flies.

18:00.119 --> 18:00.640
Ethan!

18:00.680 --> 18:02.720
Get a mop.

18:02.759 --> 18:04.440
-Those pheromones are toxic.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.400
-You've been kissing
all of us.

18:09.440 --> 18:11.240
-I thought it was food
poisoning, OK?

18:11.279 --> 18:12.759
But I didn't know I
was contagious.

18:12.799 --> 18:15.400
-The point is that you've been
leading us on, pretending that

18:15.440 --> 18:16.279
we're special.

18:16.319 --> 18:18.000
-No, you are special.

18:18.039 --> 18:18.759
Yeah, you're all so--

18:18.799 --> 18:20.440
[retching]

18:20.480 --> 18:22.160
SAMMY (OFFSCREEN): --special.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.480
Let me get that for you.

18:31.319 --> 18:34.279
Thanks.

18:34.319 --> 18:37.359
I have no idea what I'm doing.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.119
-I do.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.440
You want me to be jealous.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.720
-Really?

18:41.759 --> 18:44.279
-It all got so complicated
between us at the end.

18:44.319 --> 18:46.720
But I've been doing some work
on myself over the holidays.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.599
I--

18:47.640 --> 18:49.119
I know it was my
fault we ended.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.240
-Don't blame yourself.

18:51.279 --> 18:53.279
-I was closed off to love.

18:53.319 --> 18:57.200
But today, I release that
fear and open my heart.

18:57.240 --> 19:02.119
I'd kiss you if you weren't
contagious.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.200
Kiss you anyway.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.759
-Abigail, you didn't
do anything wrong.

19:04.799 --> 19:05.559
-I must have.

19:05.599 --> 19:08.200
I always do.

19:08.240 --> 19:11.400
-The reason that we broke up is
because I had feelings for

19:11.440 --> 19:12.599
someone else.

19:19.079 --> 19:20.079
stationary shopping.

19:20.119 --> 19:22.680
Uh, do you need a pencil case?

19:22.720 --> 19:23.759
What?

19:23.799 --> 19:24.640
You're giving me the
silent treatment?

19:24.680 --> 19:25.880
How long is this
going to last?

19:25.920 --> 19:29.319
-School starts on Monday,
so not long at all.

19:29.359 --> 19:32.240
-Actually, I'm cancelling
my tour commitments.

19:32.279 --> 19:34.519
You're going to go to school
as a day girl.

19:34.559 --> 19:37.359
-So I'll be staying
at home, with you.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
-Someone has to keep
an eye on you.

19:39.440 --> 19:43.759
We'll just have to learn
be a normal family.

19:43.799 --> 19:47.720
What is that in your--
is that a piercing?

19:47.759 --> 19:50.200
-Oh, it hurts, Mom.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.359
-[sigh]

19:51.400 --> 19:53.480
How could you disfigure
yourself like what?

19:53.519 --> 19:54.960
And what sort of place would
let a sixteen-year-old girl

19:55.000 --> 19:57.480
without permission--

19:57.519 --> 19:58.680
I'm calling the family lawyer.

20:02.119 --> 20:05.519
-So just to clarify, you broke
up with me because you got

20:05.559 --> 20:06.880
feelings for Christian.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.079
And now you're hooking up with
every girl in the school

20:09.119 --> 20:11.559
except for me because you care
about me and not them.

20:11.599 --> 20:13.240
-Right.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.240
-So essentially I
turned you gay.

20:15.279 --> 20:16.640
And he turned you straight.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.599
-No.

20:17.640 --> 20:20.200
No, it sounds worse
than it is.

20:20.240 --> 20:24.519
-You people with your feelings
are messed up!

20:24.559 --> 20:25.720
Move!

20:28.559 --> 20:29.480
-Tara!

20:29.519 --> 20:31.440
Um, how may fouettes
is it again?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.599
You did mind.

20:35.640 --> 20:37.720
You should have said.

20:37.759 --> 20:39.559
-No, I loved it when
you stole my solo.

20:39.599 --> 20:42.240
When was the last time
you danced, Grace?

20:42.279 --> 20:44.039
-Uh, a year-ish.

20:44.079 --> 20:45.480
-Right.

20:45.519 --> 20:46.960
Well, you should know that
Ethan's sending you out there

20:47.000 --> 20:50.440
to embarrass yourself so that
he can prove a point to me.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.720
-Ouch.

20:51.759 --> 20:53.079
Got it.

20:57.279 --> 20:58.680
-Don't.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.759
-I didn't say anything.

21:00.799 --> 21:06.720
[drums]

21:23.759 --> 21:25.720
[applause]

21:34.759 --> 21:37.720
[applause]

21:55.559 --> 22:00.319
-SO WHEN she danced in
London, it was--

22:00.359 --> 22:03.079
-The Royal Ballet School.

22:03.119 --> 22:06.079
-I'm glad she's not staying.

22:06.119 --> 22:08.319
Does that make me
a bad person?

22:08.359 --> 22:09.559
-Nice is overrated.

22:18.119 --> 22:21.000
[applause]

22:21.039 --> 22:22.400
-Grace!

22:22.440 --> 22:23.400
You were extraordinary.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.079
Please don't quit permanently.

22:25.119 --> 22:25.559
-I was rusty.

22:25.599 --> 22:26.720
[laugh]

22:26.759 --> 22:30.000
Um, hey, can you say goodbye
to Lucy for me?

22:30.039 --> 22:30.960
-Sure.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.319
Where should I say
you're going.

22:32.359 --> 22:33.640
-The airport.

22:33.680 --> 22:35.400
Yesterday when I got there,
there were no available

22:35.440 --> 22:36.519
flights to London.

22:36.559 --> 22:38.079
They've got me on business
class tonight.

22:38.119 --> 22:39.079
-You want me to tell
Miss Raine that

22:39.119 --> 22:40.440
you're flying to London.

22:40.480 --> 22:42.319
-I guess I'm homesick.

22:45.599 --> 22:47.160
TARA NARRATING: I think I
figured out that dream I've

22:47.200 --> 22:49.240
been having.

22:49.279 --> 22:53.160
Last year, I started out with no
friends, no boyfriend, the

22:53.200 --> 22:54.720
worst in the class.

22:54.759 --> 22:56.559
The only place to go was up.

22:56.599 --> 22:59.079
-Welcome to second year.

22:59.119 --> 23:02.119
You are no longer new, and
the same allowances will

23:02.160 --> 23:03.319
no longer be made.

23:03.359 --> 23:07.240
In second year, there are
no second chances.

23:07.279 --> 23:09.160
[school bell]

23:13.599 --> 23:16.200
-Girls, you're saying here
with me this morning.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.240
-Gentleman, I'm Zach Andrews.

23:17.279 --> 23:19.000
You're next door with me.

23:19.039 --> 23:23.240
TARA NARRATING: This year, I
have everything to lose.

23:23.279 --> 23:25.559
I can try to hang on, but I
don't know what's around the

23:25.599 --> 23:26.960
next corner.

23:33.039 --> 23:34.319
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
Come and stand at the

23:34.359 --> 23:35.519
front of the barre.

23:37.799 --> 23:39.720
-They cancelled my
credit cards.

23:39.759 --> 23:42.079
Dad's always one step ahead.

23:42.119 --> 23:44.240
-So you're staying?

23:44.279 --> 23:45.440
-For now.

23:48.799 --> 23:51.119
TARA NARRATING: I just have to
trust that I'm exactly where

23:51.160 --> 23:52.400
I'm supposed to be--

23:57.359 --> 23:58.519
home.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.079
