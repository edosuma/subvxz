WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:03.001
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.001 --> 00:06.208
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.208 --> 00:07.992
of the Major Case Squad.

00:07.992 --> 00:10.038
These are their stories.

00:14.721 --> 00:18.711
Brownsville, NY

00:21.571 --> 00:24.236
Hey, Paco, I'll get it for you.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.807
Isaiah, can you give me a push?

00:44.807 --> 00:46.841
Okay, I will.

00:49.586 --> 00:51.246
Higher.

00:51.246 --> 00:52.639
Okay.

00:53.122 --> 00:54.907
Higher.

01:25.042 --> 01:26.369
Hey.

01:26.964 --> 01:29.095
Come on.
Let's read it together.

01:39.639 --> 01:43.353
Isaiah, Ty, come give me a push.

01:49.466 --> 01:50.842
You want a push, huh?

01:50.842 --> 01:52.972
No, not a twirl.
I said a push.

01:52.972 --> 01:54.810
A twirl, twirl.

02:25.896 --> 02:29.563
What? You used to ask me
to push you... higher.

02:35.374 --> 02:37.045
Come on, we're out.

02:56.239 --> 02:57.743
Hi, mom.

03:00.073 --> 03:02.097
I gotta go, mom.

03:02.449 --> 03:06.298
Oy, chica, I want to see your phone.

03:06.298 --> 03:08.522
I don't want to lose it.

03:10.455 --> 03:12.301
What did you just call me?

03:12.301 --> 03:14.046
A loser?

03:16.424 --> 03:18.253
Loser.

03:23.590 --> 03:26.443
Come on.
Just put that away, man.

03:26.443 --> 03:28.043
You telling me what to do?

03:28.043 --> 03:29.477
We don't want any trouble...

03:29.477 --> 03:30.644
Loser.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.188
Whore.

03:32.501 --> 03:34.150
Whore?

03:34.938 --> 03:36.320
Whore.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.741
Please... don't do it.

03:39.741 --> 03:40.998
Felix, chill.

03:40.998 --> 03:42.665
Chill!

03:43.109 --> 03:44.868
Kill.

03:45.150 --> 03:47.148
Kill!

03:54.637 --> 03:55.775
Oh, my God.

03:56.007 --> 03:58.079
Oh, my God.
What the hell did you do?

03:58.079 --> 03:59.542
Get them up.

03:59.542 --> 04:00.785
Move.

04:01.304 --> 04:02.309
Get them up.

04:02.309 --> 04:03.957
Don't be touching my sister, man.

04:03.957 --> 04:05.258
Someone call 911.

04:05.258 --> 04:07.033
Get them up.
Over there.

04:07.033 --> 04:08.402
Get over here now.

04:08.402 --> 04:10.606
Someone call 911.

04:10.606 --> 04:12.636
- Get off of me.
- Get them in there.

04:19.890 --> 04:21.168
We're not gonna do anything to you.

04:21.168 --> 04:22.671
Get them up.

04:26.950 --> 04:29.316
Get down on your knees, man.

04:30.975 --> 04:32.548
Naomi.

04:33.969 --> 04:36.030
Don't be gentle with him.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.034
Naomi.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.624
Please! God!
Naomi.

04:47.319 --> 04:48.624
Please.

04:50.559 --> 04:52.606
Please, please.

04:52.818 --> 04:55.305
Stop, man.
Stop.

04:55.305 --> 04:57.333
Stop it!

04:57.333 --> 04:59.044
Stop.

05:01.621 --> 05:04.241
Please, please.

05:56.888 --> 05:59.109
Three teens, shot.
Two over there.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.539
Girl was found here.
Still hanging on.

06:01.539 --> 06:03.083
EMS did a scoop and run.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.928
- She likely?
- They said it was bad.

06:06.274 --> 06:09.485
Ty Johnson and Isaiah Morris.
Both 18.

06:09.485 --> 06:11.162
Their IDs were still on them?

06:11.162 --> 06:12.902
And wallets and cash.

06:12.902 --> 06:15.028
And the other victim's iPhone.

06:16.348 --> 06:18.763
They're shot in the back of the head.
And look at the positioning here.

06:18.763 --> 06:20.845
I think this is an execution.

06:20.845 --> 06:23.915
Three shots, three victims.

06:24.447 --> 06:26.654
Close range.

06:27.559 --> 06:29.205
That's a cold-blooded killer.

06:29.205 --> 06:31.042
What the hell is this?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.255
What is that? Urine?

06:32.255 --> 06:34.322
You think the shooter peed his pants?

06:34.322 --> 06:37.269
It's too far away from the victims.
Let's get a sample of that.

06:37.269 --> 06:39.514
Was the other victim also shot
in the back of the head?

06:39.514 --> 06:41.146
No, the stomach.

06:41.146 --> 06:45.312
Naomi Johnson, 18.
Ty's sister.

06:45.622 --> 06:48.072
All three live in the Projects
East of the Expressway.

06:48.072 --> 06:50.606
What were they doing here
in the middle of the night?

06:50.606 --> 06:53.452
Drugs or gangs?
Or both?

06:53.452 --> 06:55.810
Let's get a picture of this wall.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.827
This is a story
that will tell us something.

06:59.774 --> 07:01.664
I don't suppose you have an eyewitness.

07:01.664 --> 07:03.311
An ear witness.

07:03.311 --> 07:06.812
Dimitri Zavulanov.
Gypsy cab driver.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.579
He's parked over there.

07:08.579 --> 07:11.810
- Dimitri Zaluv... what is it?
- Zavulanov.

07:11.810 --> 07:13.791
Whatever.
I hope he speaks English.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.846
He did three minutes ago.

07:18.042 --> 07:21.570
I work in Brownsville six months.
I get robbed three times.

07:21.570 --> 07:23.356
Now I only pick up people I know.

07:23.356 --> 07:25.061
You were parked here tonight?

07:25.061 --> 07:28.307
I was on cell phone talking with my wife.

07:28.307 --> 07:31.199
I hear a "pop,"
then a minute later "pop,"

07:31.199 --> 07:32.821
then another "pop."

07:32.821 --> 07:35.464
At first I thought kids, M-80s.

07:35.464 --> 07:38.051
Did you hear anything else?
Voices?

07:38.051 --> 07:42.337
More than one.
English and Spanish.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.568
What were they saying?

07:45.089 --> 07:47.634
It was too far away.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.379
Thank you.

08:01.347 --> 08:04.577
One. 9 mm round.
To the back of each of their heads.

08:04.577 --> 08:06.297
They were killed instantly.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.048
- Same gun?
- Yeah.

08:08.048 --> 08:10.247
Any signs of assault?

08:10.247 --> 08:13.094
Well, this one looks like
he was kicked in the back.

08:13.094 --> 08:18.206
Tyrone Johnson has a bruise on
his cheekbone from a blunt object.

08:19.354 --> 08:20.769
He was pistol-whipped.

08:20.769 --> 08:22.548
What about the urine
at the crime scene?

08:22.548 --> 08:25.813
It's not from either of the victims,
and no DNA matches in the system.

08:25.813 --> 08:27.228
And these kids?

08:27.228 --> 08:29.578
- Anything on their tox screen?
- Nothing.

08:29.578 --> 08:31.474
No drugs, no alcohol.

08:31.474 --> 08:34.924
Any markings that would indicate
gang affiliation?

08:34.924 --> 08:37.859
Well, Isaiah has a tattoo,

08:37.859 --> 08:40.851
but it's hardly a gang tat.

08:41.465 --> 08:42.549
Chinese.

08:42.549 --> 08:47.635
Turns out the slight space after the first
two characters means "Peace."

08:48.137 --> 08:51.713
The last two represent universal love.

08:52.531 --> 08:54.891
Peace and love.

08:54.891 --> 08:57.360
And dead on arrival.

08:59.881 --> 09:03.653
Three kids home from college
for Thanksgiving executed in a public park.

09:03.653 --> 09:05.651
We have any idea
what they were up to? / Not yet.

09:05.651 --> 09:09.018
We're waiting for the third victim,
Naomi Johnson, to get out of recovery.

09:09.018 --> 09:10.397
Those the victims rap sheet?

09:10.397 --> 09:13.276
They don't have records.
Not even Juvi.

09:13.276 --> 09:14.653
How about gang affiliations?

09:14.653 --> 09:20.169
No, how about National Merit Society?
Eagle Scouts.

09:20.169 --> 09:22.341
City basketball championships.

09:22.341 --> 09:24.669
All three of them graduated
high school with honors.

09:24.669 --> 09:27.982
They've all won scholarships to college.

09:27.982 --> 09:32.804
Please don't tell me someone shot
three innocent kids just for the hell of it.

09:32.804 --> 09:34.911
That's what it looks like.

09:35.729 --> 09:38.282
Find out why they were in that park.

09:43.942 --> 09:47.838
I brought Isaiah to that park
when he was a boy.

09:48.155 --> 09:51.180
He started Northwestern this year.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.815
Too many young men in this community,
in this neighborhood,

09:55.815 --> 09:57.908
end up in prison.

09:57.908 --> 10:01.436
I was so proud my boy made it out.

10:03.026 --> 10:07.476
It was his first trip back home
since September.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.988
Reverend...

10:12.988 --> 10:17.559
you think there's anyone that might've
presented your son for getting ahead?

10:18.107 --> 10:20.830
Isaiah was even-keeled.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.317
He didn't get into fights.

10:23.317 --> 10:27.083
How about his friends?
Any of them into drugs or gangs?

10:29.562 --> 10:34.912
I know it's hard for you people to believe...

10:35.436 --> 10:37.602
but no.

10:37.602 --> 10:38.352
No.

10:39.623 --> 10:43.917
Isaiah was in training.
He was a star point guard.

10:43.917 --> 10:48.923
We know. His team won the city
championship last year.

10:48.923 --> 10:51.348
He would've gotten a ring for that.

10:51.348 --> 10:54.475
Do you know if he was
wearing it last night?

10:55.017 --> 10:57.159
He never takes it off.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.997
Are you sure?

10:58.997 --> 11:03.112
Because we didn't find it
on him last night.

11:05.749 --> 11:09.376
Material things.
What do they matter?

11:13.368 --> 11:16.357
How well did Isaiah know Ty and Naomi?

11:16.357 --> 11:20.524
Isaiah and Ty were... inseparable.

11:20.524 --> 11:25.040
Naomi was his twin,
so she'd always tag along.

11:25.040 --> 11:29.332
Do you know whether Naomi
had any boyfriends?

11:30.064 --> 11:34.788
I don't know.
You'd have to ask her parents.

11:34.788 --> 11:38.754
I've invited them to the candlelight
service tonight.

11:40.743 --> 11:45.630
Sometimes at these things,
gangs show up.

11:46.234 --> 11:48.707
Are you saying you want
a police presence, Reverend?

11:48.707 --> 11:53.814
In our community, they're saying
it was racial.

11:55.257 --> 11:57.982
I don't want a riot.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.584
Okay. We'll be there.

12:01.584 --> 12:03.486
Thank you.

12:05.828 --> 12:08.215
The doctors told us

12:08.215 --> 12:11.354
she has a one in three
chance of survival.

12:11.354 --> 12:16.585
Naomi and Ty were born
ten weeks premature at this hospital.

12:17.076 --> 12:20.336
Back then, they told us the same thing.

12:20.555 --> 12:22.834
Isn't that funny?

12:28.320 --> 12:31.491
I know you just lost your son,

12:31.814 --> 12:36.386
but if we could try to talk to your daughter...

12:39.363 --> 12:42.382
Yes, of course.
If it'll help.

12:42.613 --> 12:44.536
Thank you.

12:51.699 --> 12:53.592
Naomi.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.902
Squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

13:00.746 --> 13:02.483
Good.

13:02.483 --> 13:08.669
I want you to squeeze once for yes
and twice for no.

13:09.801 --> 13:12.377
Do you know who did this?

13:16.520 --> 13:19.268
Were they strangers to you?

13:21.372 --> 13:23.761
Was there more than one?

13:28.879 --> 13:29.879
Two?

13:35.914 --> 13:36.634
Three?

13:47.983 --> 13:49.727
Three.

13:54.639 --> 13:57.157
Okay, darling.

14:04.314 --> 14:07.981
If Naomi remembers anything else at all,
will you please give us a call?

14:07.981 --> 14:10.531
- Yes.
- Thank you.

14:10.860 --> 14:13.341
Who would do something like this?

14:15.963 --> 14:17.848
I don't know.

14:18.209 --> 14:20.262
But I can promise you this.

14:20.262 --> 14:23.971
Whoever did do this,
we're gonna get'em.

14:26.104 --> 14:29.124
Thank you, Detective.

14:30.497 --> 14:32.496
Why promise something like that?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.084
Why?

14:35.290 --> 14:37.569
Because the scum that did this,

14:37.569 --> 14:42.526
if I can't get him off the streets,
just give me the gold watch.

14:45.492 --> 14:46.332
Lord...

14:48.282 --> 14:50.915
tell me the way I must go.

14:50.915 --> 14:54.896
Only you lift up my soul.

14:57.149 --> 15:02.909
We must not rise up
in anger or vengeance.

15:04.763 --> 15:10.964
We must rise up with love
and hope for the future.

15:33.044 --> 15:34.629
If you hear anything, give us a call.

15:34.629 --> 15:36.447
Tips or whatever.

15:38.737 --> 15:40.861
If you hear or see anything,
give me a call.

15:40.861 --> 15:43.156
If you think of anything,
give us a call.

15:43.156 --> 15:44.439
Thank you.

15:44.439 --> 15:47.264
- If you hear anything, please give me a call.
- Anonymous tips. If you think of...

15:47.843 --> 15:49.985
If you hear anything or see
anything, give us a call.

15:49.985 --> 15:52.339
No, thanks. / Do me a favor.
Take it anyway.

15:52.339 --> 15:54.942
Could you give us a call
if you think of anything.

16:12.567 --> 16:16.473
If I lost one of my boys like that,
I doubt I could preach forgiveness.

16:16.473 --> 16:19.138
I assume there were no tips
off your canvass of the memorial.

16:19.138 --> 16:21.249
If somebody knew something,
we'd have heard by now.

16:21.249 --> 16:23.748
Neighborhood's heartbroken.
They really want us to get these guys.

16:23.748 --> 16:24.967
You may be right.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.809
Brownsville has some of the worst
felony states in the city.

16:27.809 --> 16:31.006
Last two days, not even a car alarm.

16:31.006 --> 16:32.936
So what have you got?

16:35.437 --> 16:38.591
Well... three shots from one gun.

16:38.591 --> 16:42.520
Three suspects, maybe Spanish.
No clear motive.

16:42.520 --> 16:43.708
That it?

16:43.708 --> 16:47.580
And one of the victims is missing
a school championship ring.

16:47.580 --> 16:50.041
At 48 hours, that's all you've got?

16:50.041 --> 16:52.772
Yeah, that's all we've got.
I mean, it's a nightmare.

16:52.772 --> 16:55.471
Well, then maybe you need some help.
We'll get you some fresh eyes.

16:55.471 --> 16:57.069
What do mean "Fresh eyes"?

16:57.069 --> 16:58.582
You getting pressure from upstairs?

16:58.582 --> 17:01.676
Upstairs, Logan, this has nothing to
do with upstairs... / Captain, listen...

17:01.676 --> 17:04.295
with all due respect
we're all feeling this, all right?

17:04.295 --> 17:05.473
And we just got something.

17:05.473 --> 17:09.005
Naomi's off the ventilator.
She's ready to talk.

17:11.992 --> 17:16.023
The one who shot me was older.

17:16.023 --> 17:18.338
The other two were teenagers.

17:18.338 --> 17:22.064
The shooter.
Did you get a look at him?

17:22.064 --> 17:24.836
All I could see was the gun.

17:24.836 --> 17:27.770
He held it like this.

17:27.770 --> 17:30.102
Gangster style.

17:30.420 --> 17:33.472
Did they call each other by name?

17:34.938 --> 17:39.982
The older one...
they called him Felix.

17:40.763 --> 17:44.354
They were arguing about something.

17:44.949 --> 17:49.203
Felix, he wanted my iPhone.

17:50.801 --> 17:54.733
Did they say anything else
to each other?

17:59.426 --> 18:01.839
You can ask my brother.

18:01.839 --> 18:07.717
Ty. He speaks Spanish.
He might know.

18:11.199 --> 18:14.002
Good. We'll do that.

18:14.002 --> 18:19.118
Naomi, do you remember anything at all
about what they looked like?

18:19.118 --> 18:22.498
Do you remember what
they were wearing?

18:23.256 --> 18:30.049
One of them, on his neck,
he... he had a tattoo.

18:30.486 --> 18:32.166
S... U... R...

18:37.361 --> 18:39.576
- That's it, detectives.
- Okay, thank you.

18:39.576 --> 18:43.373
Okay, we're gonna need to send in
a sketch artist in when she's up to it.

18:46.298 --> 18:48.268
Could be MS-13.
<font color=#D9EFB9>

18:48.268 --> 18:50.453
The "B" for Brownsville, the territory.

18:50.453 --> 18:51.910
What about the "G"?

18:51.910 --> 18:53.927
Maybe the mother's maiden name.

18:53.927 --> 18:55.906
The victims were all nice kids.

18:55.906 --> 18:57.970
They stayed away from gangs.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.658
Maybe they saw something
they shouldn't have.

19:00.658 --> 19:04.097
Mara Salvatrucha is known
for eliminating potential witnesses.

19:04.097 --> 19:06.850
Well, there's no incident report
for the neighborhood that day.

19:06.850 --> 19:08.702
No gang members awaiting trial.

19:08.702 --> 19:10.966
Plus the last three months,
these kids were in college.

19:10.966 --> 19:13.455
The only crime they witnessed
was underage drinking.

19:13.455 --> 19:15.566
Could this have been an initiation?

19:15.566 --> 19:19.893
MS-13 members are usually
jumped in, beaten up.

19:19.893 --> 19:23.149
Killing a stranger?
Possible.

19:23.149 --> 19:25.360
But three shootings?

19:28.307 --> 19:30.151
I'll lean harder on our informants.

19:30.151 --> 19:33.568
See if any of them know somebody
who might've ordered a hit.

19:33.568 --> 19:35.075
Appreciate it.

19:35.075 --> 19:36.738
Thanks.

19:44.721 --> 19:47.971
NYPD!
Up against the wall now!

19:48.174 --> 19:49.365
That's him.

19:49.365 --> 19:50.630
Come here.

19:53.048 --> 19:54.422
Come here.

19:56.795 --> 19:58.337
I got it, I got it.

20:02.051 --> 20:04.759
Sit. Sit. Sit.

20:27.054 --> 20:28.382
Hold it.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.326
- How long before he bleeds out?
- You got a few minutes.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.274
This is no joke.
I didn't no nothing.

20:44.274 --> 20:45.907
Just out for a run, I guess.

20:45.907 --> 20:48.009
Here.
You dropped this.

20:48.009 --> 20:49.714
That ain't mine.
That was on the ground.

20:49.714 --> 20:51.447
We really don't care.

20:51.447 --> 20:55.449
Talk to us about Isaiah, Ty, and Naomi.
The kids killed in the playground.

20:55.449 --> 20:58.649
Them?
I don't know nothing.

20:59.535 --> 21:01.733
The killers were MS-13.

21:01.733 --> 21:03.631
N... no... no way.

21:03.631 --> 21:07.043
An initiation for one of your new soldiers?

21:07.652 --> 21:10.930
Not ours.
It's some wannabe.

21:11.754 --> 21:13.684
Whoever did this, some punks.

21:13.684 --> 21:14.918
We don't play like that.

21:14.918 --> 21:17.453
Yeah, and I guess you got
your own reward out on them, huh?

21:17.453 --> 21:19.714
Something like that, yeah.

21:21.438 --> 21:24.612
Have someone look at his head
and then book him.

21:27.385 --> 21:30.939
Hey, we got a pawn shop hit on a ring.

21:30.939 --> 21:34.450
Matches the description
of the one belonging to Isaiah Morris.

21:34.450 --> 21:35.525
Come on.

21:36.666 --> 21:38.462
There are good people who live here.

21:38.462 --> 21:41.172
My customers are honest.
They just can't catch a break.

21:41.172 --> 21:42.800
Well, what about the person
who sold you this?

21:42.800 --> 21:44.667
Is that what they told you?

21:44.667 --> 21:46.678
Jewelry's stolen.
You got it back.

21:46.678 --> 21:48.056
I got no problem with the law.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.759
And now you can't remember
who pawned it?

21:49.759 --> 21:52.624
You people walk around here
like everyone who lives here is a criminal.

21:52.624 --> 21:55.251
You stop and frisk these kids
like you have a quota.

21:55.251 --> 21:58.237
Hey, that's not what this is about.

21:58.237 --> 22:03.242
This ring belonged to one of the victims
from the playground shooting.

22:06.107 --> 22:08.248
Those poor kids.

22:08.477 --> 22:11.256
That was horrible.
Horrible.

22:11.256 --> 22:15.263
I lived in Brownsville my whole life.
I thought I'd seen it all.

22:16.410 --> 22:18.087
I didn't know.

22:20.447 --> 22:22.516
I found it.
So what?

22:22.516 --> 22:24.189
Where?

22:24.695 --> 22:27.284
I don't know.
The garbage.

22:27.549 --> 22:29.721
You know, we don't want
to have to take you in, Vera.

22:29.721 --> 22:34.249
We don't want you to have to find
someone to leave this guy with.

22:34.249 --> 22:36.910
My boyfriend gave it to me.

22:36.910 --> 22:40.071
He thought I'd like a school ring
cause I never graduated. So what?

22:40.071 --> 22:42.261
Did he tell you where he got it?

22:42.261 --> 22:44.633
- It was a gift.
- That's very romantic.

22:44.633 --> 22:46.991
He pulled this off a dead boy's finger.

22:46.991 --> 22:50.025
Did you know that?
Your boyfriend shot three people.

22:50.025 --> 22:51.591
He would never shoot anyone.

22:51.591 --> 22:53.100
Isn't he MS-13?

22:53.100 --> 22:55.903
He's not in a gang.
He just acts like he is.

22:55.903 --> 22:58.331
MS-13 doesn't like to be misrepresented.

22:58.331 --> 23:02.190
So wherever your boyfriend is,
they are all looking for him.

23:02.190 --> 23:05.557
So wake up and tell us where he is.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.074
NYPD!
Open the door.

23:12.409 --> 23:14.599
We have an arrest warrant
for Hector Mendoza. Step aside.

23:14.599 --> 23:15.643
- He's not here.
- Step aside.

23:15.643 --> 23:18.292
- Step aside! Go!
- He's not here.

23:18.292 --> 23:20.604
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

23:20.604 --> 23:22.638
- What are you doing?
- Clear, clear, clear.

23:22.638 --> 23:24.968
Please, Hector is not here.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.081
We also have a search warrant.
We're looking for a gun.

23:27.081 --> 23:29.276
Did your son tell you
where he put the gun?

23:29.969 --> 23:31.638
I don't know of a gun.

23:31.638 --> 23:33.942
Hector is not here.

23:33.942 --> 23:37.859
I haven't seen him for days.
I haven't seen him.

23:37.859 --> 23:40.404
Por favor, no.
Por favor!

23:42.305 --> 23:44.516
Please, no!

23:45.422 --> 23:47.327
Pro favor.
Don't touch that.

23:47.327 --> 23:50.318
Those are my husband's ashes, please.

23:50.318 --> 23:52.010
Sorry.

23:56.971 --> 23:58.889
Oh, my God.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.934
Oh, God.

24:03.585 --> 24:06.122
You didn't know, did you?

24:16.922 --> 24:20.857
Hector would never hide a gun
in his papi's ashes.

24:20.857 --> 24:22.129
He loved him.

24:22.129 --> 24:24.392
He worked at the barber shop
every Saturday.

24:24.392 --> 24:26.593
Well, then who did put
the gun there, Mrs. Mendoza?

24:26.593 --> 24:28.701
I swear I don't know.

24:28.701 --> 24:31.433
Bunk beds.
Felix sleep here too?

24:31.433 --> 24:34.505
Felix? Hector shares this room with Paco.

24:34.505 --> 24:36.634
Paco?
His little brother.

24:36.634 --> 24:38.131
Where is Paco?

24:38.131 --> 24:41.302
I haven't seen them since yesterday.

24:41.302 --> 24:44.281
I work 12 hours a day.
I'm a housekeeper.

24:44.281 --> 24:46.410
Hector dropped out of high school?

24:46.410 --> 24:50.306
He had to so I could keep working
after his papi died.

24:50.306 --> 24:53.928
Hector took his brother to school
every day on the subway

24:53.928 --> 24:57.124
and waited outside
to bring him home every day.

24:57.124 --> 24:59.960
And now Paco is on the Honor Roll
in his high school.

24:59.960 --> 25:03.232
Is this his book?
Paco likes to read?

25:03.232 --> 25:06.977
His cousin Louisa gave it
to him for is 15th birthday.

25:06.977 --> 25:09.330
They're best friends.

25:10.764 --> 25:12.260
I don't know where Paco is.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.709
But whatever you think he did,
he didn't do it.

25:14.709 --> 25:18.834
Well, if you think he's been falsely accused
of a crime, we can help him.

25:18.834 --> 25:21.145
That would imply that I just lied to you.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.744
And only a stupid person
would lie to the NYPD.

25:23.744 --> 25:25.511
We know you're smart.

25:25.511 --> 25:27.636
That I won't dispute.

25:28.034 --> 25:31.224
You like real video games?
In the Arcade?

25:31.224 --> 25:33.748
Or do you just play on that toy?

25:33.748 --> 25:36.151
I'm better at Death Dare.

25:36.431 --> 25:38.069
What about Paco?

25:38.069 --> 25:42.556
You know, my partner here
thinks boys are faster.

25:42.556 --> 25:45.892
Me and Paco Death Dare all the time.

25:45.892 --> 25:48.031
Paco sucks.

26:30.227 --> 26:31.761
Paco.

26:32.561 --> 26:34.597
Game's over.

26:44.279 --> 26:46.060
It's not my gun.

26:46.060 --> 26:48.153
I don't know how it got in there.

26:48.153 --> 26:49.800
We believe you.

26:50.545 --> 26:52.311
We think your brother Hector
put it in there.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.789
No, no, you got the wrong guys.

26:54.789 --> 26:58.078
You were with him in the park when
he used it to shoot those three kids.

26:58.078 --> 26:59.627
That's crazy.

26:59.627 --> 27:01.380
We can prove it.

27:05.933 --> 27:08.320
He peed his pants.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.926
Dios Mio.

27:09.926 --> 27:11.608
You were scared.

27:11.608 --> 27:13.754
You didn't want to be there.

27:13.754 --> 27:16.825
You don't want to give up your brother.
We get that.

27:17.795 --> 27:22.004
So tell us.
Who's Felix?

27:25.838 --> 27:28.444
I don't know no Felix.

27:30.706 --> 27:33.175
You're more scared of Felix
than you are of your own brother.

27:33.175 --> 27:35.022
There is no Felix.

27:35.390 --> 27:37.357
No, no.

27:43.277 --> 27:45.287
It was me.

27:46.949 --> 27:48.643
I shot them all.

27:48.643 --> 27:49.483
No, no.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.220
I shot the girl in the chest.

27:53.220 --> 27:55.368
And the two guys
in the back of the head.

27:55.368 --> 27:57.549
- I confess.
- He's lying.

27:57.549 --> 27:58.829
It can't be.

27:58.829 --> 28:00.462
It can't be.
He's lying.

28:00.462 --> 28:02.576
Hey, think about this.

28:02.576 --> 28:05.800
Think about this.
You're gonna take on the whole freight?

28:05.800 --> 28:08.079
You think that makes you a big shot?

28:08.079 --> 28:08.799
Yes...

28:10.456 --> 28:12.113
- it was me.
- He's lying.

28:12.113 --> 28:13.945
He's lying.

28:16.115 --> 28:18.709
- Okay, okay, okay.
- That can't be true.

28:18.709 --> 28:20.475
That can't be true.

28:20.824 --> 28:22.661
Mrs. Mendoza, okay, okay, okay.

28:22.661 --> 28:24.050
That can't be true.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.724
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mendoza.

28:25.724 --> 28:29.295
This whole city is looking for a confession,
and we just got one.

28:29.295 --> 28:31.261
I'm sorry.

28:36.156 --> 28:38.663
I'm sorry, Mrs. Mendoza.

28:42.470 --> 28:44.364
It's a start.

28:44.653 --> 28:48.342
We mention that guy Felix,
the kid almost pisses his pants again.

28:48.342 --> 28:51.490
He'd rather go to jail than give up
Felix or his brother.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.100
He's willing to do hard time.

28:53.100 --> 28:56.336
Let's see what his mother's
willing to do to protect him.

28:58.968 --> 29:02.176
My son didn't shoot anybody.

29:02.176 --> 29:06.681
Maybe not, Mrs. Mendoza,
but our problem is he confessed.

29:06.681 --> 29:08.628
If your boys are innocent,

29:08.628 --> 29:12.489
then that means the shooter
has got to be this Felix.

29:12.489 --> 29:14.927
I don't know any Felix.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.074
What about your older son, Hector?

29:17.074 --> 29:19.477
I bet he knows where Felix is.

29:19.477 --> 29:21.780
Hector is gone.

29:21.780 --> 29:24.612
I don't know where he is.
I haven't seen him.

29:24.612 --> 29:27.580
All right, well...

29:27.580 --> 29:32.388
We can keep Paco in a holding cell overnight
and arraign him in the morning.

29:32.863 --> 29:36.878
But once he's in the system,
he's gone.

29:39.476 --> 29:41.927
Now you go home...

29:41.927 --> 29:44.832
and you think about that.

30:11.856 --> 30:13.993
Hector Mendoza.

30:15.844 --> 30:17.839
I know you.

30:19.541 --> 30:21.765
You gave me your card.

30:22.044 --> 30:24.665
At the memorial service.

30:28.313 --> 30:31.152
I gotta protect my brother.

30:33.862 --> 30:36.227
Let's do this outside.

30:45.423 --> 30:48.780
Okay, Hector.

30:49.117 --> 30:52.653
Gonna give you one more chance
to get your story straight.

30:54.021 --> 30:55.961
We know you were in the playground.

30:55.961 --> 30:58.478
So... what happened?

30:58.478 --> 31:00.668
No, I wasn't there.

31:00.916 --> 31:03.455
That ring, I found it.

31:04.111 --> 31:08.462
Looks like Paco's not the only one
in the family who makes stuff up.

31:08.740 --> 31:11.696
Like that MS-13 tattoo of yours.

31:11.696 --> 31:15.204
Good luck when you met
the real guys in prison.

31:15.204 --> 31:17.130
I can't help you.

31:25.136 --> 31:29.398
Well, looks like we're
not gonna need your help.

31:29.398 --> 31:30.360
What you mean?

31:30.360 --> 31:33.890
That was our Captain.
He says Felix beat you to it.

31:34.595 --> 31:36.208
Felix?

31:36.620 --> 31:39.489
Felix says you and Paco
shot those kids.

31:39.489 --> 31:42.234
As soon as his lawyer arrives,
we'll take his statement.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.823
- We're wasting our time. Come on.
- Hold on a second.

31:44.823 --> 31:46.457
Felix's lawyer isn't here yet?

31:46.457 --> 31:49.385
- Not yet.
- All right, hold on.

31:49.913 --> 31:52.796
Hey, man, let me explain
something to you.

31:52.796 --> 31:56.335
The first one that talks
gets the best deal.

31:56.335 --> 31:57.813
What kind of a deal?

31:57.813 --> 32:01.701
Well, you may pass yourself off as MS-13,
but your little brother?

32:01.701 --> 32:03.551
Let's just put it this way.

32:03.551 --> 32:08.342
The guys at Rikers are gonna
be very happy to see him.

32:14.804 --> 32:16.414
Felix won't know I said this?

32:16.414 --> 32:18.657
You got my word.

32:20.614 --> 32:22.322
Okay.

32:22.918 --> 32:24.854
It was him.

32:25.960 --> 32:28.020
He's psycho.

32:28.495 --> 32:32.421
- He shot that girl for nothing.
- Felix was the shooter?

32:33.918 --> 32:36.422
He wanted her iPhone.

32:38.063 --> 32:40.331
He made us shoot the others.

32:40.331 --> 32:41.766
Paco only pulled the trigger

32:41.766 --> 32:45.400
because Felix said he'll kill me
if he didn't.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.381
Here's what I want you to do.

32:47.381 --> 32:52.180
You're gonna write out
exactly what went down.

32:52.423 --> 32:55.025
- Then you won't need Felix.
- Nope.

32:55.025 --> 32:58.656
- I'm the first one to make a deal?
- Yep.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.470
Felix Aguilar from Tepito, Mexico City.

33:11.470 --> 33:13.630
Came to New York on a three-month visa.

33:13.630 --> 33:16.189
He was arrested for assault.
Scheduled for deportation.

33:16.189 --> 33:19.163
They released him ROR
he disappeared.

33:19.163 --> 33:22.590
So we're looking for a guy who's been
under the radar for the last three years.

33:22.590 --> 33:25.369
See if Naomi Johnson recognizes him.

33:34.211 --> 33:36.068
Naomi's back in surgery.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.954
Bullet embolism.

33:37.954 --> 33:41.000
We missed a fragment.
It eroded into a blood vessel.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.599
- Traveled to her lungs.
- She gonna make it?

33:43.599 --> 33:45.380
No way to tell.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.948
She's gonna be in surgery for hours.
Then after that, it's touch and go.

33:47.948 --> 33:50.312
Hey, we got a hit
on Felix Aguilar's prints.

33:50.312 --> 33:53.195
He was just picked up
in Union City for shoplifting.

33:53.839 --> 33:57.686
You had Felix Aguilar in custody
and you let him go?

33:57.686 --> 34:00.483
We didn't know it was Felix Aguilar.
He gave us a fake ID

34:00.483 --> 34:02.517
and we didn't let him go.
He jumped.

34:02.517 --> 34:03.862
Oh.

34:03.862 --> 34:05.329
Holding was full.

34:05.329 --> 34:09.235
The guy was arrested for stealing
hair dye and $10 sunglasses.

34:09.235 --> 34:10.368
What's the problem?

34:10.368 --> 34:12.434
You want to tell him or should I?

34:12.434 --> 34:14.431
You know the triple shooting
in Brownsville?

34:14.431 --> 34:17.186
- Yeah?
- He's involved.

34:18.601 --> 34:20.248
What kind of ID did he give you?

34:20.248 --> 34:22.596
He gave us somebody else's green card.

34:22.596 --> 34:25.578
We didn't catch it
till we ran the prints. Here.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.370
Yeah, that's mine.

34:32.370 --> 34:35.451
Any idea how Felix Aguilar got it?

34:36.219 --> 34:38.882
Nope. And I don't want
to press any charges.

34:38.882 --> 34:40.225
He stole your green card,

34:40.225 --> 34:43.040
and you're worried
about what he thinks of you?

34:44.181 --> 34:45.882
Yeah.

34:53.931 --> 34:56.706
Okay, what's up?

34:57.620 --> 34:59.797
We call him El Diablo.

35:00.047 --> 35:04.280
He got mad at a bus boy.
He held his hand over an open burner.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.501
He knew I talked to you,
he'd kill me.

35:06.501 --> 35:08.681
Crimes were committed using that ID

35:08.681 --> 35:11.691
so it's either gonna be you or him.

35:15.072 --> 35:16.281
Police. Get down.

35:16.281 --> 35:18.043
Down on the ground!

35:18.702 --> 35:19.663
On the floor!

35:19.663 --> 35:21.814
Felix Aguilar, who's seen him?

35:21.814 --> 35:23.744
You, you.
You have your green card?

35:23.744 --> 35:25.655
La Migra's coming in ten minutes.

35:25.655 --> 35:27.819
You help us out, we let you all go.

35:27.819 --> 35:29.238
Okay.

35:29.238 --> 35:31.350
- I know him.
- All right, get up, get up.

35:31.350 --> 35:33.019
- Who are you?
- Come over here.

35:33.019 --> 35:36.257
- Get against that wall.
- Please, I'm about to be legal.

35:36.257 --> 35:38.106
I have all my papers.
I can show you.

35:38.106 --> 35:39.702
We don't care about that.

35:39.702 --> 35:42.710
Where is Felix Aguilar?

35:43.146 --> 35:45.228
He was here the last three days.

35:45.228 --> 35:48.856
And then he pack his clothes
in a garbage bag, and he stole the car.

35:48.856 --> 35:51.073
- How long ago?
- Half hour.

35:51.073 --> 35:52.378
What's the car look like?

35:52.378 --> 35:53.938
This is Detective Falacci.

35:53.938 --> 35:57.323
- It's a silver Isuzu Trooper.
- APB out on a silver Isuzu Trooper.

35:57.323 --> 35:59.750
- Maybe about ten years old.
- About ten years old.

36:04.291 --> 36:07.195
He couldn't have gotten
much of a head start.

36:07.195 --> 36:08.670
Let's head out.

36:26.369 --> 36:28.616
- Drop the gun.
- Ho, ho, ho.

36:28.616 --> 36:30.563
Hold it, Felix, cool it.

36:30.563 --> 36:33.463
Come on now, be cool.
Just put the knife down.

36:33.463 --> 36:34.571
You telling me what to do?

36:34.571 --> 36:38.050
No, just don't do anything stupid.

36:42.348 --> 36:44.216
Next one blows your brains out.

36:44.216 --> 36:45.387
Get rid of that knife.

36:45.387 --> 36:46.918
Get down.

36:47.263 --> 36:49.479
Put your hands behind your back.

36:49.479 --> 36:52.075
And lock them over your head.

37:00.439 --> 37:01.658
You gonna be okay?

37:01.658 --> 37:03.433
I'm fine.

37:03.433 --> 37:05.801
Let's get you to the hospital, Falacci.

37:06.245 --> 37:08.022
And, Falacci?

37:08.537 --> 37:10.976
Let's never do that again.

37:14.291 --> 37:17.233
Where's your partner?
She afraid?

37:18.603 --> 37:22.885
No, actually she's looking
forward to your execution.

37:22.885 --> 37:24.898
You know the Feds want this case.

37:24.898 --> 37:26.871
You don't have a case.

37:28.613 --> 37:33.497
So Hector told us you were the shooter.

37:33.812 --> 37:36.239
He won't say that on the stand.

37:36.239 --> 37:37.559
No?

37:37.559 --> 37:41.055
Felix, no one is afraid
of El Diablo anymore.

37:41.055 --> 37:43.014
You were.

37:43.718 --> 37:45.851
I had your girl.

37:45.851 --> 37:48.394
I cut her, and you don't do nothing?

37:48.394 --> 37:49.354
Perrito.

37:53.277 --> 37:55.563
You remember her, right?

37:56.759 --> 37:59.844
You shot her in the stomach in the park.

38:01.587 --> 38:05.635
- I wasn't even in the park.
- That's not what she said.

38:05.857 --> 38:07.714
She's dead.

38:07.714 --> 38:09.484
No, she's not.

38:09.484 --> 38:13.539
And she got a very good look
at the guy who shot her.

38:17.255 --> 38:20.034
- That bitch is dead.
- No, she's not.

38:20.034 --> 38:22.047
She pulled through.

38:22.047 --> 38:26.586
In fact, she's standing right behind
this glass watching this interview.

38:26.994 --> 38:29.688
She's dead.
I know she's dead.

38:29.688 --> 38:33.223
Then how would she know that
you and Hector were arguing?

38:33.223 --> 38:35.490
And that you were afraid
to pull the trigger?

38:35.490 --> 38:36.815
Then she was lying.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.412
She said you were so scared
you pissed your pants.

38:39.412 --> 38:41.607
Not me.
Paco pissed his pants.

38:41.607 --> 38:43.040
Paco?

38:43.040 --> 38:45.756
I thought you said you weren't there.

38:49.276 --> 38:51.943
- So what?
- El Diablo.

38:51.943 --> 38:53.735
Hey, you were afraid to pull the trigger.

38:53.735 --> 38:55.945
But you know what else she said?

38:55.945 --> 38:59.390
She said that Hector made you his bitch.

38:59.390 --> 39:01.221
Hector made me his bitch?

39:01.221 --> 39:05.086
Hector made you his bitch.

39:06.414 --> 39:09.482
But the best part was when she said
the way you held your gun.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.984
She said you held it like this.

39:10.984 --> 39:14.620
Then she said she knew you were
just some dumb, stupid illegal from Tepito

39:14.620 --> 39:16.754
trying to be an American gangster.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.385
It was pretty funny.
We all laughed.

39:26.145 --> 39:27.887
You're laughing?

39:27.887 --> 39:31.723
You weren't laughing when I shot you.
You were begging.

39:33.225 --> 39:36.433
Yeah, I was the man.

39:37.127 --> 39:40.343
Hector and Paco, they just
took orders from me.

39:40.343 --> 39:42.872
Anything else you want to know?

39:43.137 --> 39:45.992
Yeah, there's just one more
think I want to know.

39:45.992 --> 39:46.992
Why?

39:50.442 --> 39:52.549
She asked for it.

39:52.549 --> 39:55.649
That bitch thought she was better than me.

39:57.418 --> 39:59.961
She come to the projects.

40:01.730 --> 40:05.005
Looked down on me
like I was nobody.

40:37.782 --> 40:39.765
Naomi didn't make it.

40:40.651 --> 40:42.990
She never regained consciousness
after the surgery

40:42.990 --> 40:46.112
and went into cardiac arrest
an hour ago.

41:06.712 --> 41:09.643
We're sorry for your loss.

41:33.347 --> 41:35.104
Oh, God.

41:41.012 --> 41:45.794
"Sorry for your loss." You know how
many times I've had to say that?

41:48.226 --> 41:50.801
It's usually automatic.

41:50.801 --> 41:53.474
But every once in a while...
