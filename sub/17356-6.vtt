WEBVTT

00:07.208 --> 00:07.906
- Speed it up, Max.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.708
We're gonna miss Chloe's
pre-school graduation party.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.044
- Relax. We're early.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.445
- We're two hours late.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.015
- Yeah, for me that's early.

00:16.183 --> 00:20.552
- Happy graduation,
Chlo--no!

00:20.554 --> 00:23.589
What...oh! We missed
the whole party.

00:23.591 --> 00:25.290
- [laughs] Remember
our graduation party?

00:25.292 --> 00:27.793
- Yeah. Uh, you filled
my pockets with candy

00:27.795 --> 00:31.196
and told everyone
I was the piñata.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.732
- It was a great party.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.534
- Gotta figure out
where everyone is.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.603
- You're right,
I do want a snack.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.704
- I didn't...say that.

00:38.706 --> 00:42.374
- You're right.
I want a nap, too.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.782
Not a single chip spilled.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.451
- There you are.
- [screams]

00:52.453 --> 00:55.154
- Glad you finally
decided to come home.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.489
The steak turned
out amazing.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.224
- Awesome. You cooked?

00:59.226 --> 00:59.725
- Yeah.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.828
I'll just put this delicious
steak next to your chips.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.231
- [plate clattering]

01:06.233 --> 01:07.733
- Enjoy!

01:07.735 --> 01:08.734
- This is nothing.

01:08.736 --> 01:12.738
I once ate a slice of pizza
off a bathroom floor.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.372
- Ugh!

01:13.374 --> 01:16.809
- Look, I'm sorry, but I was
busy training for the Z Force.

01:16.811 --> 01:18.377
- Yes, but you've
forgotten about

01:18.379 --> 01:22.214
the most important force of
all...the we force!

01:22.216 --> 01:23.649
- That's not a thing.

01:23.651 --> 01:25.117
- It used to be!

01:25.119 --> 01:26.385
[wheezing]

01:26.387 --> 01:28.120
- How long have you been
breathing like that?

01:28.122 --> 01:30.222
- A while.
I'm kind of used to it--

01:30.224 --> 01:33.292
just like being ignored
by my best friend!

01:33.294 --> 01:34.827
[wheezing]

01:34.829 --> 01:36.562
- That sounds awful.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.764
Say, you got any
steak sauce?

01:38.766 --> 01:41.333
- Shouldn't you call
the super vet?

01:41.335 --> 01:42.568
- Oh, right, yeah.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.404
I'll call them
right after I eat.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.538
- Thank you.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.207
[wheezing]

01:48.209 --> 01:50.542
- I'm gonna eat
this upstairs.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.277
- Why isn't anyone
getting back to me?

01:52.279 --> 01:56.849
Hey, Thunder Monitor, is my
family coming home soon?

02:01.188 --> 02:02.654
Get back in your hole.

02:02.656 --> 02:06.158
- It's a lair and I can
go wherever I want.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.293
- Not talking to you, Max.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.697
Oh! Where have
you guys been?

02:11.699 --> 02:16.435
- After the party we took Chloe
for a ride on her new bike.

02:16.437 --> 02:17.803
- [whooshing]

02:17.805 --> 02:19.671
Watch me ride.

02:19.673 --> 02:22.741
[whooshing]

02:22.743 --> 02:25.777
- I'm not sure
she gets it yet.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.279
- [whooshing]

02:27.281 --> 02:29.281
- I can't believe
I missed Chloe's party.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.383
Tell me every single
person that was there.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.684
Oh, Jayden? Braden?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.319
Aidan? Kayden?

02:34.321 --> 02:36.221
Sam?

02:36.223 --> 02:38.290
- Scabby Sam was here?

02:38.292 --> 02:41.160
I'm eating my food outside.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.364
- This is just so not like me.
I never miss anything.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.835
What are those looks for?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.738
- [high-pitched]
It's nothing.

02:52.740 --> 02:55.941
- High-pitched "nothing"
always means something.

02:55.943 --> 02:58.677
- We've just, sort of, gotten
used to you missing out

02:58.679 --> 03:01.346
on family time because of
your Z Force training.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.182
- Please! Name one
thing I've missed.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.850
- The Planetarium.
- The Wax Museum.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.753
- My lecture on
scrapbooking.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.255
- I wish I'd
missed that one.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.725
- Yesterday you missed an epic
family day at Prehistoric Putt.

03:13.727 --> 03:16.628
- What? You guys went to
Prehistoric Putt without me?

03:16.630 --> 03:17.496
- Not exactly.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.898
Some parents forgot to get
tickets ahead of time.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.900
- Hey, it wasn't all bad.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.335
Since we couldn't get in,

03:23.337 --> 03:25.637
we had a tailgate party
in the parking lot.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.207
- I got hit by a car.

03:28.209 --> 03:30.943
- Don't worry.
It was parked.

03:30.945 --> 03:32.511
- I didn't realize
how much family time

03:32.513 --> 03:33.478
I've been missing out on.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.214
I used to be the queen
of family time.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.848
Remember that little
crown I made myself?

03:36.850 --> 03:41.453
- Yes, honey. We were
all at your coronation.

03:41.455 --> 03:44.623
- You know what,
clear your schedules.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.592
In fact--

03:46.594 --> 03:49.861
- You keep that little crown
with you all the time?

03:49.863 --> 03:52.431
- Just be glad she didn't
bring her scepter.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.300
Nope, there it is.

03:55.302 --> 03:56.235
- Hear ye, hear ye!

03:56.237 --> 03:59.671
I declare tomorrow evening
Phoebe Family Fun Night.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.441
I shall make up for all
the time I've missed.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.275
Your queen has spoken.

04:03.277 --> 04:07.646
- MAX: I'm not coming, Queen.
- Just eat your steak!

04:08.415 --> 04:10.015
- ¶

04:10.017 --> 04:11.483
¶ What you see ¶

04:11.485 --> 04:13.018
¶ Is not what you get ¶

04:13.020 --> 04:16.688
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

04:16.690 --> 04:18.357
¶ We fit right in ¶

04:18.359 --> 04:19.591
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

04:19.593 --> 04:21.326
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

04:21.328 --> 04:22.828
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

04:22.830 --> 04:24.696
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

04:24.698 --> 04:26.665
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

04:26.667 --> 04:27.966
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

04:27.968 --> 04:29.701
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

04:29.703 --> 04:31.570
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

04:31.572 --> 04:33.005
¶ It's our reality ¶

04:33.007 --> 04:34.306
¶ Just your average family ¶

04:34.308 --> 04:37.743
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

04:37.745 --> 04:41.780
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

04:46.687 --> 04:47.819
- Thank you for coming
all the way

04:47.821 --> 04:49.888
from Metroburg,
Dr. Goodsniffer.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.591
- Are you sure she's
a real super vet?

04:52.593 --> 04:56.428
- That's what the ad
on the bus said.

04:56.430 --> 04:57.362
- With your permission,

04:57.364 --> 05:01.033
I'm going to examine
your soul...internally.

05:01.035 --> 05:03.435
- [glove snaps]
- Gah!

05:03.437 --> 05:06.505
- And that's my cue
to step out.

05:06.907 --> 05:08.373
- [wheezing]

05:08.375 --> 05:11.910
- Ah, here's the problem.
It's your cape.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.911
- My cape?

05:12.913 --> 05:14.780
I'm not gonna take
fashion advice

05:14.782 --> 05:18.083
from some crystal-
waving weirdo.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.485
- Who hurt you?

05:20.487 --> 05:24.690
Here, let me loosen
your cape.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.892
- Ahhhhh...

05:26.894 --> 05:28.060
You fixed me!

05:28.062 --> 05:29.928
Wait. So, I'm not sick?

05:29.930 --> 05:33.632
- No. Your body is
just bursting with love.

05:33.634 --> 05:35.867
- What?
- You're chubby.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.004
But the good news
is you don't have bunny fever.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.672
- Bunny fever?
What's that?

05:40.674 --> 05:45.077
- Your insides turn to jelly
and you need 24-hour care

05:45.079 --> 05:48.714
for the rest of your
pain-filled life.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.083
But you don't have it.

05:51.085 --> 05:51.817
- But if I did,

05:51.819 --> 05:55.087
Max would have to take
care of me all the time.

05:55.089 --> 05:55.821
- Now I do recommend

05:55.823 --> 05:59.424
these organic mints
for your butt breath.

05:59.426 --> 06:01.560
- Get out!

06:01.562 --> 06:03.762
- Namaste!

06:05.499 --> 06:07.132
- Oh, Max!

06:07.134 --> 06:08.967
- What did
Dr. McWeirdo say?

06:08.969 --> 06:11.570
- It's bad, Maxie.
Real bad.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.874
I have something
called bunny fever.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.975
- Really?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.411
Oh, man.
That sounds serious.

06:19.413 --> 06:23.482
- The doctor said it's
caused by neglect.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.550
I don't want you
to blame yourself.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.886
But it's all your fault.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.988
- Oh, Colosso,
I'm so sorry.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.690
Is there anything
I can do to help?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.125
- The super vet said
I needed someone

06:33.127 --> 06:35.861
to watch me over me
all the time.

06:35.863 --> 06:36.728
- I got you.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.863
You won't have to
lift a finger...

06:37.865 --> 06:41.500
or whatever you call those
things in your paws.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.970
- There's no telling
how much time I have.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.171
Just hold me.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.173
- That's a little weird.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.642
- [wheezing]

06:54.548 --> 06:57.749
- Hey, you guys ready for
Phoebe Family Fun Night?

06:57.751 --> 07:02.521
- Oh, I thought you said
Phoebe Family Fun Fight.

07:02.523 --> 07:06.591
- Why...why would I...
never mind.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.192
- [whooshing]

07:07.194 --> 07:09.561
Who wants a knuckle
sandwich?

07:09.563 --> 07:13.064
- I clearly said
Phoebe Family Fun Night.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.599
- I'll go change.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.767
[whooshing]

07:15.769 --> 07:18.503
- Right, guys, we are going
somewhere awesome.

07:18.505 --> 07:21.006
Feast your eyes
on these bad boys.

07:21.008 --> 07:21.773
- [squealing]

07:21.775 --> 07:22.908
- Six tickets to Mini Golf

07:22.910 --> 07:25.911
and Family Fun Zone
Prehistoric Park.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.913
- Phoebe! How did you
get these tickets?

07:27.915 --> 07:29.815
They've been sold
out for months.

07:29.817 --> 07:32.150
- Let's just
say I know a guy.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.519
Are you Guy?

07:37.191 --> 07:41.860
I'm also going to the fifth
grade dance on Friday.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.529
- Well, I can't wait to go
to Prehistoric Putt.

07:44.531 --> 07:47.632
- You know, kids, your dad
was an award-winning

07:47.634 --> 07:49.067
mini golfer back in his day.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.670
- They called me
hole-in-one-Hank!

07:51.672 --> 07:54.806
On account of all
the hole-in-ones!

07:54.808 --> 07:58.844
- Isn't that clever?
[laughing]

07:58.846 --> 07:59.945
- Can we please leave now?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.013
- Yeah, let's start
Family Fun Night.

08:02.015 --> 08:02.948
- All right, all right.

08:02.950 --> 08:06.751
But let's call it
Phoebe Family Fun Night...

08:06.753 --> 08:09.855
because that's what
the t-shirts say!

08:09.857 --> 08:13.658
You get a shirt...
and you get a shirt.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.660
- That steak was delicious!

08:15.662 --> 08:18.530
You didn't stick it in
your armpit, did you?

08:18.532 --> 08:20.966
- Of course not.

08:20.968 --> 08:21.933
Ah!
- Ah!

08:21.935 --> 08:24.803
- BOTH:
[laughing]

08:24.805 --> 08:26.104
- Now this is what I miss,

08:26.106 --> 08:28.273
the old Max and Colosso
back and forth.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.042
- Hey, you seem like you're
feeling much better.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.711
- I do?

08:32.713 --> 08:33.712
[wheezing]

08:33.714 --> 08:35.247
[raspy voice]
Because I'm pretty sure

08:35.249 --> 08:38.283
my insides are
turning to jelly.

08:38.285 --> 08:39.851
- What can I do to help?

08:39.853 --> 08:40.952
- Well, there is one thing

08:40.954 --> 08:42.254
that'll take my mind
off the pain.

08:42.256 --> 08:46.858
I wrote this song and I'd love
for you to sing it for me.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
- Yeah, maybe later, buddy.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.897
- There might
not be a later.

08:51.899 --> 08:53.565
[wheezing]

08:53.567 --> 08:55.667
- Okay, fine.

09:00.741 --> 09:05.844
¶ Oh, Colosso, your style
makes me weak in the knees ¶

09:05.846 --> 09:10.015
¶ Remember the time
that you gave me fleas ¶

09:10.017 --> 09:12.884
¶ I love all the evil
things you do ¶

09:12.886 --> 09:19.791
¶ And at the end of the day
I pick up your poo ¶

09:19.793 --> 09:22.060
- Yeah.
Sing it out, Maxie.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.763
- ¶ I ain't gonna
kick this habit ¶

09:24.765 --> 09:28.600
¶ Because my best friend
he's a rabbit ¶

09:28.602 --> 09:31.870
¶ My best, best, best, best,
best, best, best ¶

09:31.872 --> 09:35.073
¶ Best, best, best,
best, best, best, best ¶

09:35.075 --> 09:39.044
¶ Colosso and Max
are best friends ¶

09:39.046 --> 09:43.915
¶ And I pick up his... ¶

09:43.917 --> 09:47.919
[high note]
¶ poo-oo ¶¶

09:49.156 --> 09:51.222
- [sighing]

09:51.725 --> 09:55.327
- Hope you enjoyed that because
I'm never singing it again.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.628
I'm gonna get a drink.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.663
- Well, hurry up because
when you get back, uh...

09:58.665 --> 10:02.334
I need you to do that
thing you sang about.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.703
- Oh, man.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.074

FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:
Alert, alert.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.711
Dr. Beatrix Goodsniffer
calling.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.346
- Hey, doc.
- Namaste.

10:14.348 --> 10:17.248
I'm calling with the name
of a personal trainer.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.416
- Oh, don't need one.

10:18.418 --> 10:22.988
Surely a vet like you can
admire these pythons.

10:23.824 --> 10:26.057
- [giggles]
It's not for you.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.226
It's for your chubby bunny.

10:28.228 --> 10:28.960
- I'm confused.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.663
Why would Colosso need
to work out if he's sick?

10:31.665 --> 10:32.364
- He's not sick.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.699
He just has a big belly.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.701
- But why would he tell
me he has bunny fever?

10:36.703 --> 10:41.206
- I'm no doctor, but my guess
is that he's a liar.

10:41.208 --> 10:43.041
- Yeah, he is.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.442
Wait you're not a doctor?

10:44.444 --> 10:48.013
- Uh...Namaste.
- But...

10:49.116 --> 10:56.721
- ¶

10:56.723 --> 10:58.456
- Why do you have
18 putters?

10:58.458 --> 10:59.724
- Because after I sink a putt,

10:59.726 --> 11:01.993
I like to do a little
celebration dance.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.928
- Show 'em, Hank.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.431
- Hole-in-one! Woo!

11:06.433 --> 11:09.134
- [golf club thuds]

11:09.136 --> 11:12.337
- Save it for
the course, baby.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.240
- For being the hottest
ticket in town,

11:15.242 --> 11:16.875
this place sure looks empty.

11:16.877 --> 11:17.542
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.711
You know what, you guys go take
a picture with the dinosaur

11:19.713 --> 11:21.980
and I'll figure what's going
on here, all right?

11:21.982 --> 11:24.149
Don't have any
fun without me.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.850
Just kidding.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.919
Not really.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.422
- Cool! A real dinosaur.

11:30.424 --> 11:33.024
- Billy, you know dinosaurs
are extinct.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.125
- I don't care
if they stink.

11:34.127 --> 11:37.195
I still wanna take
a picture with them.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.800
- Oh, uh...excuse me, sir.

11:41.802 --> 11:44.736
Do you work here?

11:44.738 --> 11:45.336
- I'm the owner.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.906

Phoebe Thunderman of the...

11:54.915 --> 11:56.347
Hiddenville Thundermans.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.450
- Lovely to meet you.
[chuckles]

11:58.452 --> 11:59.851
We're closed.

11:59.853 --> 12:02.053
- What? No, no, no.
You can't be closed.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.089
- Oh, I'm afraid I can't
let anyone in.

12:04.091 --> 12:08.760
You see the dinos need
a little, uh, jiggery-pokery.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.829
- I'm sorry, could you
say that one more time

12:10.831 --> 12:13.465
in American teenager?

12:13.467 --> 12:16.468
- The dinos are broke, yo.
[laughs]

12:16.470 --> 12:18.069
But do be sure
to come again.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.038
- But, no, no, no,
it has to be tonight.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.906
It's Phoebe Family
Fun Night.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.943
- Oh! Well, in that case...
[chuckling]

12:24.945 --> 12:26.811
...we're still closed.

12:26.813 --> 12:29.481

12:29.483 --> 12:31.883
- Cheerio.

12:31.885 --> 12:32.383
- Wait.

12:32.385 --> 12:36.287
Oh, oh, wait! Mr. Healey-
Hutchinson, you forgot your...

12:36.289 --> 12:39.224
- It's closed?
- Are you kidding me?

12:39.226 --> 12:40.959
- Worst night ever!

12:40.961 --> 12:43.228
- Did you guys really think
I wouldn't come through?

12:43.230 --> 12:47.298
I had this park shut down
for our special night.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.267
- BILLY, NORA: CHLOE:
Yay!

12:49.269 --> 12:51.002
- Welcome...

12:54.174 --> 12:56.841
...to Prehistoric Putt!

13:12.425 --> 13:13.391
- ALL:
[cheering]

13:13.393 --> 13:15.493

13:15.495 --> 13:19.030
Woo!
- [golf club thuds]

13:19.199 --> 13:23.001
- All right, time for
a Phoebe Family Snack Break.

13:23.837 --> 13:26.437
Who wants...

13:26.439 --> 13:29.407
- [drumstick thuds]

13:29.409 --> 13:32.243
- ...a dino drumstick?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.078
- Vending machine meat?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.080
Yes, please.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.116
- [dinosaur cane roaring]
"Prehistoric Putt."

13:38.118 --> 13:40.385
- Oh, no...

13:40.387 --> 13:41.820
A photo booth! Hey, guys!

13:41.822 --> 13:43.421
Why don't we go make
some memories...

13:43.423 --> 13:46.391
out of the way,
where no one can see us.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.326
- Just let me finish
this drumstick.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.495
- [powers whooshing]

13:50.497 --> 13:52.130
Guess you're done.

13:52.132 --> 13:52.997
In the booth.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.266
Go, go, go. Come on.
Everyone go in.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.269
Let's go, let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.105
- NORA: What's that smell?
- BILLY: Don't look at me.

14:01.107 --> 14:04.275
- CHLOE:
Sorry. I have issues.

14:04.277 --> 14:09.881
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
I knew someone stole my keys.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.984
We have a trespassasaurus.

14:12.986 --> 14:14.118
- Grrr!

14:14.120 --> 14:17.856
- Yes, you're right...
large security person.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.892
We should sweep
the perimeter.

Tally-ho!

14:23.997 --> 14:26.231
- [flashbulb pops]

14:27.000 --> 14:31.903
- All right. Let's check
out our family photo.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.105
- PHOEBE:
Not our best.

14:34.107 --> 14:38.042
Guys, why don't we finish up
Phoebe Family Fun Night--

14:38.044 --> 14:39.577
wait for it--

14:39.579 --> 14:42.413
at home! Booyah!

14:42.415 --> 14:44.916
- But we're only half way
through the course.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.051
- Yeah. Your father's
on a hot streak.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.052
He's gonna be
the first person

14:48.054 --> 14:50.188
to get a hole-in-one
on the 18th hole.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.590
- According to the website,
if you sink that shot,

14:52.592 --> 14:56.661
the dinosaur will spit out
a lifetime family pass.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.196
- BARB, CHLOE, NORA, BILLY:
Whoa...

14:58.198 --> 15:01.199
- Fine, but, um, why don't
we make it interesting...

15:01.201 --> 15:01.933
speed golf.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.635
We play the rest of
the holes as fast as we can.

15:03.637 --> 15:06.137
- Well, international
mini-golf rules clearly--

15:06.139 --> 15:09.540
- You're already
losing Dad.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.046
- Max!
- [bell ringing]

15:15.048 --> 15:17.348
- Ma-a-a-a-ax!

15:19.219 --> 15:21.219
What took you so long?

15:21.221 --> 15:27.058
- I was upstairs doing some
research on bunny fever.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.493
- Bunny what?

15:28.495 --> 15:30.495
Oh, bunny fever!
The thing I have.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.097
Yeah, it eats away
at your memory.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.966
[wheezing]

15:34.968 --> 15:35.967
- Well, there's good news.

15:35.969 --> 15:38.937
Turns out it's caused
by an allergic reaction

15:38.939 --> 15:40.371
to tiny clothes.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.473
- Tiny clothes?

15:42.475 --> 15:43.141
- Yeah.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.242
Your outfits are
making you sick.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.111
But, all we have to do
is destroy your clothes

15:47.113 --> 15:48.279
and you'll be good as new.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.280
- Destroy my clothes?

15:49.282 --> 15:52.050
But...shouldn't we get
a second opinion?

15:52.052 --> 15:53.651
- We don't have time
for that, buddy.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.687
Let's start with
your favorite outfit.

15:55.689 --> 16:00.992
- Ooh! My leather-lined
wizard ensemble?

16:03.296 --> 16:07.265
- [flames sizzling]
- [gasps]

16:07.267 --> 16:08.499
No!

16:08.501 --> 16:10.268
- Sounds like you're
getting worse.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.103
I'd better step it up.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.171
[powers whooshing]

16:13.173 --> 16:16.374
It's for your own good,
Dumbledork.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.278
- Stop! Stop!
Clothes before bros!

16:20.280 --> 16:25.383
Look, I...I really don't
have bunny fever.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.285
- I know.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.153
I spoke to the doctor.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.288
Why would you do that?

16:30.290 --> 16:32.457
You made me sing
that stupid song.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.057
- Stupid?

16:33.059 --> 16:35.360
It's already been
covered by Ed Sheeran.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.496
- Seriously, Colosso,
I was worried.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.163
- I know.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.399
I just needed a way to
hang out with you again.

16:41.401 --> 16:45.470
It was like the old days
when we were the we force.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.473
- Again, not a thing.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.574
But I'm sorry,
you're right.

16:49.576 --> 16:53.011
I have been really busy training
for the Z Force and...

16:53.013 --> 16:55.013
I'll try to make
more time for you.

16:55.015 --> 16:56.180
- Great.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.181
Can I ask one more favor?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.051
- Fine. But this
is the last time.

17:00.053 --> 17:08.559
- COLOSSO & MAX: [harmonizing]
¶ I pick up his poo-oo ¶

17:10.597 --> 17:13.698
- Billy go! Nora go!
Chloe, go!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.166
- Okay, see you at home.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.067
[whooshing]

17:16.069 --> 17:19.404
- Not what I meant, but,
hey, one down, four to go.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.239
Okay, guys, let's get
to the 18th hole

17:21.241 --> 17:23.674
before we get caught--

17:23.676 --> 17:28.046
--up in all
the prehistoric fun.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.416
- HANK: There she is,
the 18th hole.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.352
All I have to do is hit
the ball into its mouth,

17:34.354 --> 17:36.220
down the tail
and into the hole.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.256
No one has ever
sunk this putt

17:38.258 --> 17:41.092
in the history
of Prehistoric Putt.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.360
- Didn't this
place just open?

17:42.362 --> 17:46.330
- Shh! Let Daddy
have his moment.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.832
- [dinosaur cane roaring]
"Prehistoric Putt."

17:47.834 --> 17:50.768
- Uh, yeah, but can you
have it a little faster?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.570
- Fine.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.275
Oh, halfway there!

18:00.213 --> 18:02.480
- ALL:
Ohhhhh!

18:02.482 --> 18:03.781
- It's not there
yet, guys.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.617
All we have to do is wait
for gravity to pull it in--

18:06.619 --> 18:09.620
even if it takes
all night.

18:10.824 --> 18:13.124
- [powers whooshing]

18:13.126 --> 18:14.459
- ALL:

18:14.461 --> 18:17.261
- Gravity, you've
done it again.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.398
- Hole-in-one-Hank!
Woo--oh!

18:20.400 --> 18:21.799
Actually,
I'm keeping this one.

18:21.801 --> 18:25.803
That way I'll always remember
Phoebe Family Fun Night.

18:25.805 --> 18:30.274
- That's what the t-shirts
were for, but, whatever.

18:30.276 --> 18:35.113
- Ha! Look!
It's the hooligans!

18:35.115 --> 18:37.281
- Grrr!

18:37.283 --> 18:38.249
- You heard him.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.750
What are you doing here?

18:39.752 --> 18:40.685
- We can explain.

18:40.687 --> 18:42.520
- Yeah. I just made
a hole-in-one.

18:42.522 --> 18:47.391
That dinosaur is about to
spit out a lifetime pass.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.260
- [flames roaring]

18:49.262 --> 18:51.729
- That dinosaur
is wonkerjawed!

18:51.731 --> 18:53.698
You've doomed us all!

18:53.700 --> 18:55.833
- BARB: Everybody
get out of here.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.436
- [flames roaring]

19:00.273 --> 19:03.541
- [moaning]
Now my ankle's wonkerjawed!

19:03.543 --> 19:06.711
- [flames roaring]
- [whimpering]

19:06.713 --> 19:09.313
- Where are you going?

19:09.315 --> 19:09.847
Oh...oh...

19:09.849 --> 19:12.717
my dino babies have
turned against me.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.851
- Quick, you guys go.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.853
I'm gonna go save this...
funny talking man

19:15.855 --> 19:18.589
I've never seen
and/or spoken to.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.557
- We're not leaving you.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.392
We'll all do this together.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.527
- [flames roaring]

19:22.529 --> 19:25.196
- I think I can super-speed
past those flames.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.864
- But if he sees
us use our powers,

19:26.866 --> 19:29.300
the whole town's gonna
know our secret again.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.202
- [flames roaring]

19:31.204 --> 19:32.603
- Wait...

19:32.605 --> 19:34.739
maybe we can use this egg
to block the dinosaur's mouth.

19:34.741 --> 19:37.742
Dad, do you think you can
make another hole-in-one?

19:37.744 --> 19:38.342
- I'm on it.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.579
Good thing I still have
my last Thunder putter.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.815
[grunts, winces]

19:44.817 --> 19:47.885
- Dad, hurry up!
- All right.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.256
[laughing]
- You did it!

19:52.258 --> 19:55.660
- No. We did it.
- Thanks, Dad.

19:55.662 --> 19:59.263
- Me and my putter.
- Okay.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.632
- NORA: Are you okay?
- No.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.768
No, you...scoundrels.

20:03.770 --> 20:06.637
You broke into my beloved
Prehistoric Putt

20:06.639 --> 20:10.741
and almost fried me
like fish and chips.

20:10.743 --> 20:11.609
- Broke in?

20:11.611 --> 20:13.978
- Mmm! Fish and chips.

20:13.980 --> 20:18.583
- You! You're the one who
made off with my keys.

20:18.585 --> 20:19.383
[chuckles]

20:19.385 --> 20:20.551
Well, I'm gonna
call the police.

20:20.553 --> 20:24.388
- Police? Phoebe,
what is going on here?

20:24.390 --> 20:27.625
- You guys are gonna laugh!

20:27.627 --> 20:31.262
Uh, when we showed up,
this place was "closed."

20:31.264 --> 20:34.899
Ha...so I borrowed
the little man's keys and,

20:34.901 --> 20:35.733
sort of, snuck us in here.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.804
So, we're technically
"trespassing."

20:39.806 --> 20:41.372
[sheepish laugh]

20:41.374 --> 20:43.641
Why aren't you
guys laughing?

20:43.643 --> 20:45.977
- Oh, we'll have plenty
of time to laugh...

20:45.979 --> 20:48.246
in prison!

20:48.248 --> 20:49.714
- Phoebe, why would
you do that?

20:49.716 --> 20:51.949
- 'Cause I just wanted us
to all have an amazing night

20:51.951 --> 20:53.951
to make up for everything
I've missed out on lately.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.021
I don't know, I just didn't
wanna disappoint you guys again.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.757
- Phoebe, we haven't been
disappointed in you.

20:59.759 --> 21:04.629
I mean, not until you
started breaking the law.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.830
- You haven't?

21:05.832 --> 21:06.831
- Of course not.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.500
- Sweetie, you've been
out saving the world.

21:09.502 --> 21:10.501
- Sorry, how's that?

21:10.503 --> 21:15.973
- With your good grades
and "can do" attitude.

21:15.975 --> 21:19.310
- We couldn't be
more proud of you.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.444
- Thanks, Dad.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.813
You're talking to your putter
again, aren't you?

21:22.815 --> 21:24.015
- No, I'm not.

21:24.017 --> 21:27.385
Yes, I am.
[kisses]

21:27.387 --> 21:33.691
- I think it's time for
a Phoebe Family Fun Hug.

21:33.693 --> 21:34.992
- Moments like this are why

21:34.994 --> 21:37.795
I came to the New World to
create Prehistoric Putt.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.865
- Wait, does that mean you're
not gonna call the police?

21:40.867 --> 21:46.470
- No, and, uh, in return, may
I have one of those t-shirts?

21:46.472 --> 21:48.372
- Aww! You wanna remember us?

21:48.374 --> 21:50.441
- I most certainly do.

21:50.443 --> 21:51.909
- [hammer banging]

21:51.911 --> 21:53.678
- There!
[chuckling]

21:53.680 --> 21:58.482
Phoebe Thunderman
is banned for life.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.824
- Stop leaving
me your keys!

22:10.730 --> 22:26.744
- ¶
