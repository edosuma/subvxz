00:08.843 --> 00:12.053
Oh. I somehow

00:08.843 --> 00:12.053

00:12.095 --> 00:13.472
How you get a VIP ticket?

00:13.514 --> 00:16.141
-Fifty dollars!

00:13.514 --> 00:16.141
-Fifty dollar?

00:16.183 --> 00:18.519
-That's a dinner and a movie.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.519

00:22.230 --> 00:24.441
Maybe you think

00:22.230 --> 00:24.441
there's a red carpet?

00:24.483 --> 00:29.070
I suppose it's not entirely

00:24.483 --> 00:29.070
unlikely the director

00:24.483 --> 00:29.070
might be there.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.824
You think maybe, uh,

00:29.112 --> 00:31.824
star of movie will be there?

00:31.866 --> 00:35.911
This is a VIP screening

in Toronto.

00:31.866 --> 00:35.911
Anything is possible.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.955
Mmm. Maybe paparazzi

00:35.953 --> 00:37.955
take our picture.

00:37.997 --> 00:41.375
Or we get invited

00:37.997 --> 00:41.375
to an after-party

00:37.997 --> 00:41.375
at a swanky hotel.

You tell me

01:33.176 --> 01:34.887

Mrs. Kim.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.265
It was a beast to move.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.809
But it's worth it to see

01:38.306 --> 01:40.809
that look of appreciation

01:38.306 --> 01:40.809
on your face.

01:41.852 --> 01:43.144

Or that you finally

01:51.028 --> 01:52.195
threw this guy out.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.907
What? Everyone has a limit.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.117
So basement is clean now?

01:57.158 --> 01:59.494
Not yet. Clean basement

01:57.158 --> 01:59.494
is a big job,

01:59.536 --> 02:01.162
even for big, strong Appa.

-Ah, maybe I call Jung

-Boom.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.171
-Why you sneak attack?

I don't have to sneak attack

-Ugh.

Good luck getting her

03:17.156 --> 03:18.866

03:18.907 --> 03:21.242
all the time she is

03:18.907 --> 03:21.242
looking at her phone.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.495
Only time she's not looking

03:21.284 --> 03:23.495
at her phone is when I call.

03:23.537 --> 03:26.790
I just want to talk,

03:23.537 --> 03:26.790
but it's all this texting

03:23.537 --> 03:26.790
and Snapchatting.

03:26.832 --> 03:30.251
So, I said, "Marla,

06:48.491 --> 06:50.660
have a girls' night in.

06:50.702 --> 06:54.248
Just you, me, in.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.458
Uh, yeah, sure.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.458
We could do that. Sometime.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.380
Thing is, it's Friday night.

06:57.500 --> 07:01.380
You know, TGIF?

07:01.420 --> 07:03.757
Yeah. No school tomorrow.

07:03.798 --> 07:05.675
We can talk all night.

07:05.717 --> 07:09.679
First topic, how to make

07:05.717 --> 07:09.679
your face less round.

07:09.721 --> 07:13.267
-That could be fun, but...

07:09.721 --> 07:13.267
-Special surprise!

07:13.308 --> 07:15.018
-We paint our nail.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.018
-Really?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.686
'Cause remember that time

07:15.060 --> 07:16.686
I put on clear polish?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.521
You made me take it off.

07:18.563 --> 07:19.898
You said the only people

07:18.563 --> 07:19.898
who paint their nails

07:18.563 --> 07:19.898
are prostitutes.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.400
That don't sound like me.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.279
Eh, look,

07:21.441 --> 07:25.279
it all might be great,

07:21.441 --> 07:25.279
but I have plans.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.447
Oh. Okay.

07:28.531 --> 07:29.950
Oh, Gerald?

07:28.531 --> 07:29.950
Are you ready?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.826
Mrs. Kim!

07:29.991 --> 07:31.826
What a surprise.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.080
I didn't hear you guys

07:31.868 --> 07:35.080
talking, like, at all.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.373
Hi, Gerald.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.875
Because I was in my room

07:36.415 --> 07:38.875
for the conversation.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.502
Look, I'm sorry.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.502
We're meeting people,

07:38.917 --> 07:41.502
so I gotta go.

07:41.544 --> 07:45.048
-We'll do this

07:41.544 --> 07:45.048
another time, okay?

07:41.544 --> 07:45.048
-Yeah. Other time.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.135
If it's easier, you can

07:45.090 --> 07:48.135
obviously just leave that here.

07:48.176 --> 07:49.344
Yeah, I can. But no.

07:51.388 --> 07:52.513
-All right!

07:51.388 --> 07:52.513
-[Mr. Chin] Do you have it?

07:52.555 --> 07:53.932
-All right!

07:52.555 --> 07:53.932
-I don't think I have it.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.516
-I'm losing it.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.516
-Okay, okay!

07:55.558 --> 07:56.726
Put down! Put down!

07:56.768 --> 07:58.812
[panting]

07:58.853 --> 08:01.231
I thought your wife wanted us

07:58.853 --> 08:01.231
to throw this out, not in.

08:01.273 --> 08:05.110
Yeah, but I miss table.

08:01.273 --> 08:05.110
It's, uh, good fun

08:01.273 --> 08:05.110
for whole family.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.488
Huh. Who know,

08:05.152 --> 08:08.488
maybe Jung want to play?

08:08.529 --> 08:11.032
Or Janet. Or Mrs. Kim.

08:11.074 --> 08:13.327
[panting] Or Jung.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.288
-You know,

08:13.368 --> 08:16.288
just a friendly game.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.288
-I get it.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.123
When you get a chance

08:16.330 --> 08:18.123
to show your dominance

08:18.165 --> 08:19.540
over a young rival,

08:18.165 --> 08:19.540
you take it.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.293
[scoffs] What you talking?

08:21.335 --> 08:24.754
Look, there comes

08:21.335 --> 08:24.754
a time when some young,

08:21.335 --> 08:24.754
virile bus boy,

08:24.796 --> 08:26.547
let's call him Huang Li Wu,

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549
comes around,

08:26.589 --> 08:28.549
flexing his muscle,

08:28.591 --> 08:30.885
grabbing the attention

08:28.591 --> 08:30.885
of a beautiful prep cook

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
who might

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
otherwise be interested

08:30.927 --> 08:33.638
in an older restauranteur.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.765
Hypothetically, of course.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.809
It's just a game.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.809
Doesn't matter who win.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.853
Sure, sure,

08:37.851 --> 08:39.853
but take my advice.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.440
Lay waste to your son

08:39.894 --> 08:43.440
in table tennis

08:39.894 --> 08:43.440
while you still can.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.778
Why you not just

08:46.567 --> 08:48.778
fire your bus boy?

08:48.820 --> 08:51.448
Oh, I've thought about it,

08:48.820 --> 08:51.448
but he'd never survive.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.533
He's a looker,

08:51.490 --> 08:53.533
but not much upstairs.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.412
[indistinct chatter]

09:01.624 --> 09:04.585
Thanks again for stopping

09:01.624 --> 09:04.585
those guys from beating me up.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.297
Not everyone in a ponytail

09:04.627 --> 09:07.297
likes to be called "M'lady."

09:07.339 --> 09:08.507
It's supposed to be ironic.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.176
-Oh...

09:09.383 --> 09:11.176
-[laughter]

09:11.218 --> 09:14.595
[Umma] So then I say, "No!"

09:11.218 --> 09:14.595
[Chelsea] I can't believe

09:11.218 --> 09:14.595
you said that!

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
-[Umma] Well, what else

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
I'm going to say?

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
-[both laughing]

09:16.639 --> 09:19.600
-Umma?

09:16.639 --> 09:19.600
-Oh! Janet?

09:16.639 --> 09:19.600
You home already?

09:19.642 --> 09:20.977
It's 1:30.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.562
Uh-oh.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.607
-Time for me

09:22.603 --> 09:26.607
to turn into pumpkin.

09:22.603 --> 09:26.607
-[both laughing]

09:26.649 --> 09:29.777
Oh, thank you, Chelsea.

09:26.649 --> 09:29.777
That was so much fun.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.446
Don't thank me, polish pal.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.156
-Oh!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.156
-Oh... We're polish pals.

09:33.198 --> 09:35.492
[both laughing]

09:35.534 --> 09:37.994
-Okay, see you, uh?

09:35.534 --> 09:37.994
-Night, Umma.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.830
Oh, nail polish.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.830
Don't want to mess up.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.999
-Right.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.999
-Bye, Yong-mi.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.125
Bye-bye.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.629
So, you were just

09:45.626 --> 09:48.629
hanging with my mom?

09:48.671 --> 09:50.924
-Oh, my God. She's lolz.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.924
-Yeah?

09:50.965 --> 09:54.635
And a straight talker.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.635
I am too skinny for pinstripes,

09:50.965 --> 09:54.635
you know?

09:54.677 --> 09:57.889
-I do know.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.889
-My parents are always,

09:54.677 --> 09:57.889
"Chelsea, you're so great.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.599
Everything you do is wonderful.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.059
We raised the limit

09:59.640 --> 10:01.059
on your credit card."

10:01.101 --> 10:02.894
Yeah. So lame, right?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.980
-[Janet] So, what else

10:02.936 --> 10:05.980
did you guys talk about?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.980
-Gerald!

10:06.022 --> 10:08.775
Hey, Chelse!

10:06.022 --> 10:08.775
What a surprise.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.651
I didn't hear you guys talking.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.652
Like, at all.

10:12.737 --> 10:15.656
[yawns] Well,

10:12.737 --> 10:15.656
I'm gonna head to bed,

10:15.698 --> 10:17.658
but feel free to stay up,

10:15.698 --> 10:17.658
do your girl-talk thing.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.620
And miss cuddle time?

10:17.700 --> 10:20.620
[chuckles]

10:20.661 --> 10:22.622
-Night, Janet.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.622
-Okay. Night.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.377
Don't smudge my nails,

10:24.707 --> 10:27.377
bum-bum. [chuckles]

10:29.212 --> 10:30.213
Bum-bum?

10:33.091 --> 10:37.053
I need a strong muscle guy

10:33.091 --> 10:37.053
like you have to finish job.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.513
-It's Jung.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.513
-[Umma] Jung?

10:38.555 --> 10:39.680
Hi, Jung!

10:39.722 --> 10:41.766
So when you get message,

10:39.722 --> 10:41.766
call me back.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.684
Okay. See you.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.645
-What's happen?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.645
-Nothing.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.522
Just, uh, finish

10:45.686 --> 10:47.522
cleaning basement.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.857
Then maybe after

10:47.564 --> 10:49.857
have a hang-out time.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.319
-You and, uh, Jung?

10:49.899 --> 10:52.319
-Yeah.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.946
Uh, what kind of hang-out time?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.698
I don't know.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.698
See what happen.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.535
Okay, but, uh,

10:57.740 --> 11:00.535
don't hang out too much.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.829
We is parent, not friend.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.829
Have to remember.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.664
Just, uh, try to be good Appa.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.834
But, uh, when you see Jung,

11:04.705 --> 11:07.834
don't talk so much

11:04.705 --> 11:07.834
about his muscle.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.670
-Otherwise, he gonna

11:07.875 --> 11:10.670
post all over Internet.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.670
-Okay. [chuckles]

11:16.759 --> 11:18.886
[sighs]

11:19.762 --> 11:21.222
[chuckles]

11:23.391 --> 11:25.684
Hey. How's Planet Janet?

11:25.726 --> 11:26.727
Chelsea!

11:26.769 --> 11:29.105
Oh, are you here

11:26.769 --> 11:29.105

11:26.769 --> 11:29.105
[chuckles]

11:29.147 --> 11:30.731
-Ha-ha.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.360
-Ha-ha-ha.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.360
-Ha-ha-ha-ha! [chuckles]

11:33.401 --> 11:34.569
But yes.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.736
Oh.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.406
You guys are so tight

11:35.778 --> 11:38.406
all of a sudden.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.116
-Cool.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.116
-Is it cool?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.618
Absolutely.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.744
-[bangs shelf]

11:41.660 --> 11:43.744
-Umma, your friend's

11:41.660 --> 11:43.744

11:43.786 --> 11:44.996
-[Umma] Oh?

11:43.786 --> 11:44.996
-Ah!

11:45.038 --> 11:46.705
Chelsea! Hi!

11:47.081 --> 11:48.333
I got your text.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.876
Here's the album

11:48.375 --> 11:49.876
we listened to the other night

11:49.917 --> 11:51.961
plus my own playlist,

11:49.917 --> 11:51.961
"Sunday Hangs."

11:52.003 --> 11:55.798
Oh, thank you. So kind.

11:52.003 --> 11:55.798
Such good music.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.175
Yeah?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.175
What album is it, Umma?

11:57.217 --> 11:58.635
-Clairvoyants.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.635
-Live.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.179
-Clairvoyants have a live album?

11:58.677 --> 12:01.179
-Yeah, it just drop.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.014
-Did I say right?

12:01.221 --> 12:03.014
-You got it.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
So sweet, Chelsea.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
Thank you.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.312
And maybe you can teach me

12:05.433 --> 12:09.312
how to make that scrumptious

12:05.433 --> 12:09.312
Korean thing we had?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.522
-Sundubu-jjigae?

12:09.354 --> 12:10.522
-Mmm-hmm.

12:10.564 --> 12:12.023
[Umma] Come over

12:10.564 --> 12:12.023
Friday night, I show you.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.733
-Umma, Friday night

12:12.065 --> 12:14.733
is maybe not the best--

12:12.065 --> 12:14.733
-I'd love to.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.069
See you then. [giggles]

12:17.028 --> 12:18.946
Janet, can you work Friday?

12:18.988 --> 12:20.781
-[door bell chimes]

12:18.988 --> 12:20.781
-Night?

12:20.823 --> 12:23.577
-[exhales]

12:20.823 --> 12:23.577
-You wanted to see me?

12:23.618 --> 12:24.952
[sighs] Come in

12:23.618 --> 12:24.952
and shut the door

12:23.618 --> 12:24.952
behind you.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.371
Sounds serious.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.788
We've made a huge mistake.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.416
The gift basket wasn't for me.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
Not sure how that's

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
a "we" mistake.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.792
You ate all the snacks.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.171
You're missing the point!

12:31.834 --> 12:35.171
The basket was for Terence

12:31.834 --> 12:35.171
from his grandmother.

12:35.213 --> 12:39.300
Alejandro did, however,

12:35.213 --> 12:39.300
send me a YouTube video

12:35.213 --> 12:39.300
of a dancing bird.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.843
Damn!

12:39.342 --> 12:40.843
That bird's got moves.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.803
[laughing] I know, right?

12:40.885 --> 12:42.803
I could watch it all day.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.973
Except I can't.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.973
I have to figure out

12:42.845 --> 12:45.973
how to fix this Terence thing.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.851
You could start

12:46.015 --> 12:48.851
by not eating the rest

12:46.015 --> 12:48.851
of his gift basket.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.812
-I'm stress eating

12:48.893 --> 12:51.812
from the guilt.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.812
-That's guilt eating.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.772
Look, just buy him

12:51.854 --> 12:53.772
a new gift basket.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.485
$300? Whoa, mama!

12:57.527 --> 12:59.820
You can get a whole cabin

12:57.527 --> 12:59.820
made out of cheese logs

12:57.527 --> 12:59.820
for that.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.864
Uh, don't tempt me.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.864
But there's got to be

12:59.862 --> 13:01.864
a cheaper one.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
-[knocking on door]

13:01.906 --> 13:03.199
-Hey, Shannon.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.659
[Shannon] Terence!

13:03.241 --> 13:04.659
We're in a meeting.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.494
Okay, no problem.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.954
[plastic crinkling]

13:08.955 --> 13:10.831
Do you guys hear that?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.126
Is that what you came

13:10.873 --> 13:13.126
in here for, Terence?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.126
To play mind games?

13:13.167 --> 13:15.836
-No, I just thought--

13:13.167 --> 13:15.836
-Stop thinking, start working!

13:15.878 --> 13:19.006
That's our new motto.

13:15.878 --> 13:19.006
It's actually what

13:15.878 --> 13:19.006
this meeting was about.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
-Doesn't make any sense.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
-You're still thinking!

13:21.092 --> 13:22.927
Come on, Terence.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.011
I'm so sorry.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.221
-[sighs]

13:24.053 --> 13:25.221
-[door closes]

13:27.307 --> 13:29.058
Poor guy.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.058
I feel so bad for him.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.060
Oh. Is there rosemary

13:29.100 --> 13:31.060
in that shortbread?

13:31.102 --> 13:32.604
Oh, my God!

13:31.102 --> 13:32.604
They're so good.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.655
Hey! Is Chelsea here?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.281
I don't know.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.950
I never know.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.950
It's those little

13:43.323 --> 13:45.950
soundless feet.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.868
Even in heels.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.370
Maybe she's with my mom.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.248
[sighs] I know.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.248
That's been great.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.250
I think it's kinda weird.

13:54.292 --> 13:56.795
Maybe, but it's freed up

13:54.292 --> 13:56.795
my schedule.

13:56.835 --> 13:58.463
Like, Friday just opened up,

13:58.505 --> 14:00.298
so I'm going to do

13:58.505 --> 14:00.298
a<i> God Of War</i> marathon

13:58.505 --> 14:00.298
with Smeats and Kippen.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.840
What are you doing Friday?

14:04.093 --> 14:07.514
Um... I was gonna fire up

14:04.093 --> 14:07.514
the console with the guys.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.476
No. My parents are taking us

14:07.555 --> 14:11.476
to La Jupe on King Street.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.476
[laughing]

14:11.518 --> 14:13.227
[Gerald] Is that a...

14:11.518 --> 14:13.227
a restaurant?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.562
I thought you were

14:13.269 --> 14:14.562
going to my mom's.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.897
Oh, yeah.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.233
I'm going to have to cancel.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.233
Getting into La Jupe

14:16.939 --> 14:19.233
is impossible.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.944
So it's a play?

14:19.275 --> 14:21.944
Or is it the circus?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.530
And you can't wear that,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.530
by the way.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.072
Okay, but to what?

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
It's just, I think my mom

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
was looking forward

14:25.114 --> 14:27.074
to seeing you.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.786
Oh, she won't mind.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.786
We're buds! [chuckles]

14:29.828 --> 14:31.538
Okay, but it is French, right?

14:37.960 --> 14:39.546
[sighs] Okay!

14:39.587 --> 14:40.921
Want me to take

14:39.587 --> 14:40.921
some of this outside?

14:40.963 --> 14:42.549
Yeah, maybe.

14:42.590 --> 14:47.512
Or, we can start by, uh,

14:42.590 --> 14:47.512
clean up old bedsheet

14:42.590 --> 14:47.512
over there.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.681
-You mean this?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.681
-Yeah, like that.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.890
Good idea, Jung.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.935
Waah?

14:52.225 --> 14:54.935
Old ping-pong table?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.354
Where you coming from?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.272
[chuckles] I think

14:56.396 --> 14:58.272
we throw you out.

14:58.314 --> 15:01.275
-Was this here before?

14:58.314 --> 15:01.275
-Haven't seen in such

14:58.314 --> 15:01.275
a long time, huh?

15:01.317 --> 15:02.777
Looks like a brand-new

15:01.317 --> 15:02.777
bracket here.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.154
Oh, I don't think so.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.154
So old and dusty, uh?

15:05.196 --> 15:07.490
[blows air and coughs]

15:07.532 --> 15:09.950
Huh. Yeah.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.950
Want to take a break?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
-What? From not working?

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
-Yeah. What you think?

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
One game.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.954
Warm up muscle, huh?

15:13.996 --> 15:15.415
-Yeah. Sure.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.415
-[chuckles]

15:23.548 --> 15:27.301
-Uh, wow. That really

15:23.548 --> 15:27.301
brings back memories.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.301
-Yeah.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.929
Hey, remember when

15:27.343 --> 15:29.929
Janet was little

15:27.343 --> 15:29.929
and she wanted to play,

15:29.970 --> 15:31.972
so you put her on the table

15:29.970 --> 15:31.972
and we'd play trying

15:29.970 --> 15:31.972
not to hit her.

15:32.014 --> 15:33.391
Not to hit?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.643
-Oh, I wanted to hit her,

15:33.433 --> 15:35.643
I just wasn't good enough.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.643
-Ha.

15:36.310 --> 15:37.478
You serve.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.439
Oh... You serve.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.439
Home court advantage.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.316
Oh.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.316
Zero serving zero, huh?

15:45.027 --> 15:47.029
-Ooh.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.029
-Still a little rusty.

15:47.071 --> 15:50.991
It's okay. Just take time and,

15:47.071 --> 15:50.991
uh, try you best, hmm?

15:51.701 --> 15:52.869
One serving zero.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.038
Whoo! One-one.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.417
Okay, everybody warm.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.794
Now we play for real.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.012
Ooh! Ah!

16:12.054 --> 16:13.347
Your point. Good one.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.600
I tell you,

16:13.389 --> 16:15.600
I am unst-Appa-ble.

16:20.062 --> 16:21.856
Good news. Look what

16:20.062 --> 16:21.856
was just delivered,

16:21.898 --> 16:24.734
straight from your gran

16:21.898 --> 16:24.734
to the cutest little manager

16:21.898 --> 16:24.734
at Handy.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.277
-Ta-da!

16:24.776 --> 16:26.277
-Wow.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.612
Look at all this.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.615
Crackers and...

16:27.654 --> 16:30.615
And cheese and...

16:30.657 --> 16:33.033
Wait! Are those

16:30.657 --> 16:33.033
ketchup packages?

16:33.075 --> 16:36.537
Ooh! Portion-controlled

16:33.075 --> 16:36.537
and portable. Your gran

16:33.075 --> 16:36.537
thinks of everything.

16:36.579 --> 16:37.997
Huh.

16:38.038 --> 16:39.123
Swiss chocolate?

16:39.165 --> 16:40.458
Gruyere?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.418
Mmm-mmm.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.418
Yum-dilly-ish, am I right?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.418
[chuckles]

16:42.460 --> 16:44.879
I'm just a little surprised.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.879
Gran hates the Swiss.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.047
-Well, she loves you.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.047
-You don't understand!

16:47.089 --> 16:49.676
She went to Switzerland once

16:47.089 --> 16:49.676
and was treated so horribly.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.051
They were rude to her,

16:49.717 --> 16:51.051
they ignored her,

16:51.093 --> 16:52.428
even though she spoke

16:51.093 --> 16:52.428
perfect German.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.054
That's terrible.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.389
She was in the Italian region,

16:54.096 --> 16:55.389
but she's never forgiven them

16:55.431 --> 16:57.475
and she refuses to support

16:55.431 --> 16:57.475
the Swiss economy.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.269
Well, maybe your grandmother

16:57.517 --> 17:00.269
has forgiven the Swiss economy.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.269
[chuckles nervously]

17:00.311 --> 17:02.605
My mom thinks it's time

17:00.311 --> 17:02.605
to put gran in a home.

17:02.647 --> 17:06.066
I said she was wrong,

17:02.647 --> 17:06.066
but you can't argue

17:02.647 --> 17:06.066
with evidence like this.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
-Gran is a goner.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
-I wouldn't read

17:06.108 --> 17:08.068
too much into it.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.236
I'm sure she's fine.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.071
And are these

17:09.278 --> 17:11.071
cough drops Ricola?

17:11.113 --> 17:12.782
Oh, my God!

17:11.113 --> 17:12.782
I have to call my sister.

17:13.282 --> 17:14.534
[sighs]

17:16.243 --> 17:17.411
I hate you.

17:19.330 --> 17:21.165
[both panting]

17:26.170 --> 17:28.715
-Yes! Whoo!

17:26.170 --> 17:28.715
-Yeah!

17:28.756 --> 17:30.132
Ooh, ooh!

17:30.174 --> 17:31.676
-Ooh, ooh!

17:30.174 --> 17:31.676
-What are you doing?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.261
You don't remember

17:31.718 --> 17:34.261
victory dance?

17:31.718 --> 17:34.261
Yeah. I show you.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.514
-Ooh, ooh!

17:34.303 --> 17:36.514
-But you didn't win.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.265
Ooh-- [laughing]

17:36.556 --> 17:38.265
What you talking?

17:38.307 --> 17:39.767
The ball hit the edge

17:38.307 --> 17:39.767
of the table.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.186
-No!

17:40.351 --> 17:42.186
-I heard a tick.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.856
-I hear not a tick.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.856
-You can't hear not a tick.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.233
Shh. Listen.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.233
Not a tick.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.569
This is ridiculous.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.569
You always have to win,

17:47.274 --> 17:49.569
don't you?

17:49.610 --> 17:51.111
I don't have to.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.111
Just do.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.780
The ball hit the table.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.116
Jung, more important

17:52.822 --> 17:56.116
than winning is being

17:52.822 --> 17:56.116
a good loser.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.952
Exactly, Appa.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.121
I only think that's true,

17:57.994 --> 18:01.121
because I don't have

17:57.994 --> 18:01.121
real experience losing.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
You know what? Forget it.

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
Nothing's changed.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.125
What? Yeah...

18:03.374 --> 18:05.125
Best two out of three game.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.126
For Kim Cup.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.211
It's not worth it.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.088
-Ah, come back. Jung!

18:07.253 --> 18:09.088
-What?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.676
Don't tell your Umma we fight.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.094
Fine. Don't tell Janet.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.055
-I not tell anyone.

18:15.135 --> 18:17.055
-Me neither.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.139
-Might tell Kimchee.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.139
-Ah! Don't tell Kimchee.

18:19.181 --> 18:20.140
Well, then don't tell Mr. Chin.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.976
I already say

18:20.182 --> 18:21.976
I don't tell anyone.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.103
Hey. What's going on?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.272
We just talking.

18:26.313 --> 18:28.107
Yeah. It's hard to hear

18:26.313 --> 18:28.107
each other down here.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.361
Ping-pong? No way.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.113
I could never beat you guys.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.116
But that ends today.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.162
Oh! Seriously? Come on!

18:39.744 --> 18:42.162
For the Kim Cup.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.790
Am I the only one

18:42.204 --> 18:43.790
who remembers that?

18:47.752 --> 18:48.795
[grunts]

18:54.174 --> 18:55.134
[door closes]

18:56.218 --> 18:58.178
-Hey, Umma.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.178
-Janet.
