Good boy!

01:26.287 --> 01:28.622
[Nicole] Come on, Alec!
Whoa! [laughs]

01:28.656 --> 01:31.159
[James] That first
step is a doozy, isn't it?

[clapper snaps]

01:45.806 --> 01:47.975

01:48.008 --> 01:51.845

Birthdays...

01:54.682 --> 01:56.650
vacations...

01:56.684 --> 01:57.951
weekend trips.

01:57.985 --> 01:59.653
***

01:59.687 --> 02:02.690
Watching him grow up as
a toddler to a young man,

02:02.723 --> 02:07.161
to a handsome six-foot
man, it was the best.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.663
[Nicole] He wasn't the oldest,
but he acted like the big

02:09.697 --> 02:11.699
brother to everybody.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.133
Every extent of the word
when you say "big brother,"

02:13.167 --> 02:14.001
that was Alec.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.703
-[woman] Now!
-Five...

02:15.736 --> 02:17.171
-[woman] Go!

-[screams]

02:18.339 --> 02:19.307
[laughter]

02:19.340 --> 02:21.842
I remember him always
being funny, laughing.

02:23.711 --> 02:25.145
[Alec] Aw, come on.

02:25.179 --> 02:27.548
You're supposed to be asleep.

02:27.581 --> 02:30.884
[Nicole VO] I remember
Alec always had a hat on.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.688
Those were his two addictions:
sunglasses and baseball caps.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.858
***

02:37.891 --> 02:40.894
I remember all of the
Fourth of July weekends.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.699
[James VO] Fourth of July
was his favorite holiday ever.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.034
[Nicole VO] He could do
without the Christmas

02:47.067 --> 02:50.170
presents, just give him
fireworks. [laughs]

02:53.707 --> 02:55.543
Um...

02:58.612 --> 03:00.180
but...

03:00.214 --> 03:02.049
[sniffles]

03:02.082 --> 03:05.052
I have a hard
time remembering...

03:05.253 --> 03:08.088
things that happened...

03:08.389 --> 03:11.725
from the time his
body was found until

03:11.759 --> 03:13.727
the day of the funeral.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.107
[Nicole] Were you
able to start the car?

04:00.140 --> 04:01.241
[James] Yup.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.411
I think the car is started.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.646
Car is started.

04:26.867 --> 04:33.173
*sparse tense music

04:35.343 --> 04:37.144
Which building is
it that we're in?

04:37.177 --> 04:38.812
We're in the Cap--
we're in the main building?

04:38.846 --> 04:40.113
Okay.

04:40.147 --> 04:43.684
***

04:43.717 --> 04:46.286
We made a pact that no other
family will go through the

04:46.320 --> 04:48.689
pain that we're going through.

04:49.523 --> 04:53.461
We're trying to make a change,
a difference in the system.

04:53.494 --> 04:56.330
I don't wanna see
anyone else suffer.

04:56.364 --> 04:59.333
I hear too many
names along with Alec.

04:59.367 --> 05:01.702
Enough is enough.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.304
[man] So we have you, um,
on that side of the table.

05:04.338 --> 05:05.939
-Okay.
-[man] Okay.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.741
[Nicole VO] Never, ever
pictured myself to be the type

05:07.775 --> 05:10.978
of person to be at the
Capitol fighting for something

05:11.011 --> 05:12.846
like this.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.983
I think it's a way for
me to funnel my grief into

05:16.016 --> 05:18.719
something positive.

05:18.752 --> 05:22.856
I think it's a way
to try to honor Alec.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.726
It's a way to...

05:26.394 --> 05:28.862
make some really positive
changes that are gonna affect

05:28.896 --> 05:31.064
millions of people.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.068
-Good morning.
-[Nicole] Good morning.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.204
-Hi, Jim Abeler.
-[Nicole] Nicole.

05:37.237 --> 05:38.506
-Nice to meet you.
-[James] James.

05:38.539 --> 05:39.006
-Hey, James.
-Hi.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.041
Nice to meet you.

05:48.382 --> 05:49.349
We're here today to
discuss the issue,

05:49.383 --> 05:53.053
to hear stories from all
of these brave people,

05:53.086 --> 05:55.923
and to work together to
form solutions moving forward.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.391
Thank you.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.193
I'm scared; I'm scared
to turn 26 and get off my

06:00.227 --> 06:01.895
parents' insurance.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.764
And I don't know what's
gonna happen when that

06:03.797 --> 06:06.033
happens, and it's...

06:06.066 --> 06:08.101
all about future.

06:08.135 --> 06:10.237
This insulin pen that we
bought in the United States

06:10.270 --> 06:12.406
cost us 140 dollars.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.409
It would last us,
um, about a week.

06:15.443 --> 06:18.245
This is an insulin pen
that we bought in Taiwan.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.913
It cost us eight dollars.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.416
I mean, you could see;
these are-- they're called

06:22.450 --> 06:24.251
"NovoRapid"
instead of "NovoLog,"

06:24.284 --> 06:26.086
but they are exactly
the same thing.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.121
[woman] Without
insulin, I am dead,

06:28.155 --> 06:31.224
my little brother is dead,
and millions of other people

06:31.258 --> 06:32.192
are dead.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.128
Our next testifiers
are Nicole Smith-Holt

06:35.162 --> 06:37.397
and James Holt, Jr.,
and, uh, I believe, uh,

06:37.431 --> 06:40.400
James Holt, Jr. is
gonna, uh, start it off.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.270
[James] I am Alec's father.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.274
Can you even imagine what
it was like to tell people

06:47.307 --> 06:49.477
that your son died at 26...

06:49.510 --> 06:52.946
because he struggled to afford
the one medicine created to

06:52.980 --> 06:54.982
save his life?

06:55.516 --> 06:58.986
In many cases, it is cheaper
to book a round-trip flight

06:59.019 --> 07:02.122
and a hotel to a foreign
country to purchase insulin

07:02.155 --> 07:04.124
than it is to buy
it here in the US.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.827
My son would still be
alive today if his treatment

07:06.860 --> 07:08.095
was affordable.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.797
Thank you.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.299
[Nicole] [sighs]

07:12.800 --> 07:14.602
My name is Nicole,

07:14.635 --> 07:16.970
[voice wavering]
and I'm Alec's mom.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.142
I just need a second.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.979
But I'm here today to share
a very painful and personal

07:26.013 --> 07:29.316
account of the doth--
death of my son Alec.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.622
In 2015, Alec was just
turning 24 and was diagnosed

07:34.655 --> 07:37.157
with type 1 diabetes.
[sniffles]

07:37.190 --> 07:40.027
This came to a surprise for
our family because we have no

07:40.060 --> 07:45.032
family history of this, and he
was always healthy and active.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.368
Alec handled his diabetes
well; he adjusted his diet,

07:48.401 --> 07:51.338
he handled his daily regimen,
he took responsibility of his

07:51.371 --> 07:53.907
life and for his treatments.

07:53.941 --> 07:55.909
While still under my
insurance, his bills at the

07:55.943 --> 07:58.311
pharmacy would range
between two and 300 dollars

07:58.345 --> 08:00.881
out-of-pocket per month.

08:01.081 --> 08:04.351
In May of 2017,
Alec turned 26.

08:04.384 --> 08:06.186
Alec was no longer
eligible to be covered

08:06.219 --> 08:08.388
under my health insurance.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.392
His salary was
approximately 40,000 dollars

08:12.425 --> 08:16.196
a year, and that's fairly
decent for the Midwest.

08:16.229 --> 08:19.667
But because of his salary, he
was not eligible for state or

08:19.700 --> 08:23.036
federal subsidy
through insurance,

08:23.070 --> 08:25.372
and he was left
with just two options:

08:25.405 --> 08:28.041
one, pay extremely high
premium and deductible...

08:28.075 --> 08:29.910
[sniffles]

08:29.943 --> 08:32.079
or go without insurance and
pay out-of-pocket at the

08:32.112 --> 08:35.916
pharmacy, and pray
nothing major happens.

08:35.949 --> 08:39.587
Alec made the difficult
decision to forgo insurance,

08:39.620 --> 08:42.055
but he did not have the money
that the pharmacist was

08:42.089 --> 08:45.192
charging him for
insulin and supplies:

08:45.225 --> 08:47.561
1300 dollars.

08:48.228 --> 08:51.899
[sighs] That's a lot of money.

08:55.736 --> 08:59.406
On June 20th, 2017...

09:00.273 --> 09:03.410
[voice wavering] the
last day I saw my son...

09:03.911 --> 09:07.114
he stopped by the
house with friends.

09:07.447 --> 09:09.717
He informed me that he would
be picking up his meds in the

09:09.750 --> 09:12.152
next day or two.

09:12.620 --> 09:15.255
We believe he felt he could
stretch out his remaining

09:15.288 --> 09:19.092
insulin until his
payday on June 30th.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.095
*sensitive ambient music

09:22.129 --> 09:24.965
[Nicole VO] He didn't
call and ask for help.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.636
Um...

09:29.102 --> 09:32.272
so he began
rationing what he had.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.108
June 27...

09:35.776 --> 09:37.577
Alec's girlfriend had
been trying to reach him

09:37.611 --> 09:39.980
with no success.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.581
She went to his apartment
to find out why he was not

09:41.615 --> 09:44.484
responding to calls or texts.

09:44.685 --> 09:47.120
His car was in the parking
lot, he was not answering his

09:47.154 --> 09:49.456
door, and she could hear
his phone ringing,

09:49.489 --> 09:51.458
and got worried.

09:51.491 --> 09:53.994
She found an unlocked window
and climbed in to find him

09:54.027 --> 09:56.630
down on his bedroom floor.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.101
Alec was pronounced
dead on the scene.

10:01.134 --> 10:05.005
***

10:05.038 --> 10:08.308
He aged off of my
insurance June 1st.

10:09.009 --> 10:15.148
His body was found
on June 27th of 2017.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.485
You know, it
wasn't even a month.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.455
He could not
afford to stay alive.

10:22.489 --> 10:27.627
***

10:29.663 --> 10:34.201
[typing]

10:34.234 --> 10:36.336
[S. Vincent VO] The cost of
prescription drugs in general

10:36.369 --> 10:38.338
-- and insulin
in particular --

10:38.371 --> 10:41.041
are very, very high.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.377
This problem has been quite
difficult to solve in the US.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.380
People have been
talking about it for years.

10:47.881 --> 10:53.520
Insulin was first discovered
in 1921 by Banting and Best.

10:53.553 --> 10:56.189
Banting and Best sold the
patent for insulin discovery

10:56.223 --> 10:59.526
for one dollar -- one Canadian
dollar -- because they felt

10:59.559 --> 11:02.362
that no one should
profit off this.

11:02.395 --> 11:06.834
[S. Vincent VO] In 1996, the
first analog insulin was sold

11:06.867 --> 11:09.369
for 21 dollars a vial.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.538
You come to 2019...

11:11.571 --> 11:14.374
it goes all the way up
to almost 300 dollars --

11:14.407 --> 11:17.577
over a 1,000 percent
price increase.

11:17.911 --> 11:20.714
Three companies --
Novo Nordisk, Sanofi,

11:20.748 --> 11:23.851
and Eli Lilly -- manufacture
the vast majority of insulin

11:23.884 --> 11:26.453
that's sold in the US.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.389
Every time one company
increases their price,

11:29.422 --> 11:32.225
the other one goes up
by the same amount --

11:32.259 --> 11:34.261
lockstep.

11:34.594 --> 11:37.397
And this has been
going on for, like, 20 years.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.233
Recent studies show that
insulin can be manufactured

11:40.267 --> 11:44.738
for as low as three to five
dollars for a one-month vial.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.973
Let's just play
with some math here.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.776
I mean, if it costs five
dollars to manufacture a vial

11:48.809 --> 11:52.712
of insulin, and it's priced
at 300 dollars per vial,

11:52.746 --> 11:56.283
that's over a
5,000 percent change.

11:58.651 --> 12:01.889
You could get that same vial
of insulin for around 10 to 15

12:01.922 --> 12:04.758
dollars in some countries.

12:05.258 --> 12:09.229
And so, in the United States,
we have to pay unreasonable

12:09.262 --> 12:11.598
amounts, and...

12:12.766 --> 12:13.934
that's killing people!

12:13.967 --> 12:16.436
When you have to hear this
over and over and over again,

12:16.469 --> 12:18.906
it's almost like you are...

12:18.939 --> 12:22.442
trying to beat down
a-- a brick wall

12:22.475 --> 12:25.145
with your bare hands to get
people to really understand this

12:25.178 --> 12:29.316
is real, this is today, and
we gotta change this system.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.618
I thought we were the only
family that was experiencing

12:31.651 --> 12:33.753
these type of things, um...

12:33.787 --> 12:35.588
the only ones that were
having issues with

12:35.622 --> 12:37.290
affordability of insulin.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.592
And when I-- when
all this came to light,

12:39.626 --> 12:42.329
I was like, "Hell no!

12:42.362 --> 12:44.631
This has to stop."

12:44.664 --> 12:50.637
*dramatic ethereal music

13:00.513 --> 13:11.324
*tense ambient music

13:17.397 --> 13:19.366
[Dr. Halprin VO] I take
care of people with diabetes

13:19.399 --> 13:22.836
every day, many of
whom are on insulin.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.706
Diabetes is a disease
of elevated blood sugars.

13:26.739 --> 13:30.243
The difference
between type 1 and type 2?

13:30.277 --> 13:33.981
Type 2 diabetes is much more
common and prevalent in the

13:34.014 --> 13:36.383
United States and
throughout the world.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.887
It's more a disease of the
efficiency with which insulin

13:39.920 --> 13:43.991
works, so insulin is
produced but it does not work

13:44.024 --> 13:46.526
efficiently in
doing its job,

13:46.559 --> 13:50.864
and that's generally due
to that person's lifestyle.

13:51.198 --> 13:55.235
In type 1, it's an
autoimmune disease.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.238
Your body destroys the
beta cells of the pancreas,

13:58.271 --> 14:01.875
and the pancreas
ceases to produce insulin.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.378
If you don't have diabetes,
your pancreas produces a

14:05.412 --> 14:08.415
little bit of
insulin all the time.

14:08.448 --> 14:12.385
Insulin's job is to get
glucose from the blood

14:12.419 --> 14:14.387
into the cell.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.023
When you eat,
your blood glucose,

14:16.056 --> 14:18.391
which is the blood
sugar, will go up,

14:18.425 --> 14:22.729
and your body will match
that with insulin so you don't

14:22.762 --> 14:25.398
overshoot and you
don't have low sugars.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.901
Without that insulin,
you will have serious

14:27.935 --> 14:29.269
medical consequences.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.438
Your body will
start to shut down,

14:31.471 --> 14:35.275
it can lead to a condition
called diabetic ketoacidosis.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.912
[Dr. Halprin VO] Diabetic
ketoacidosis or DKA --

14:38.946 --> 14:42.449
if your blood sugars are very
high and it's not treated,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.285
it starts turning
into ketones,

14:45.318 --> 14:49.289
and ketones will produce
acid in the blood.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.593
The person who has type 1
diabetes will not survive

14:53.626 --> 14:56.629
without taking insulin.

14:56.663 --> 14:58.966
Along with testing
of blood sugars,

14:58.999 --> 15:01.935
the insulin has to be
taken many times a day,

15:01.969 --> 15:04.671
seven days a week,
365 days a year.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.674
There's no break to that.

15:08.141 --> 15:12.645
I would actually die quicker
from not using insulin

15:12.679 --> 15:15.448
than I would from-- from thirst.

15:15.482 --> 15:18.651
There's no way to prevent it
as far as we know at this

15:18.685 --> 15:22.489
moment, and there's
no cure for it.

15:28.128 --> 15:37.937

together with you*

15:42.509 --> 15:44.644
[laughs]
I love Christmas music.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.014
I'm the annoying friend that,
when it's Christmas in July,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.649
[laughing] I listen
to Christmas music.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.120
[Emma] I don't like this song!

15:53.153 --> 15:55.655
[laughs]

15:57.724 --> 16:10.670
*mellow ambient music

16:10.703 --> 16:12.505
[Sandra VO] I was
diagnosed with type 1

16:12.539 --> 16:15.508
diabetes when I
was 19 months old.

16:16.509 --> 16:20.713
They almost lost me
when I was diagnosed.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.916
I went into a
coma for nine days.

16:24.251 --> 16:27.554
And Emma was seven years
old when she was diagnosed --

16:27.587 --> 16:29.389
seven and a half.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.990
[Sandra] And what do
you need insulin for?

16:31.024 --> 16:33.160
My diabetes.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.862
[Sandra] But why
are you doing a shot?

16:35.895 --> 16:38.698
'Cause my
pancreas doesn't work.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.867
[Sandra VO] I feel like almost
like my brain just stopped

16:40.900 --> 16:43.170
working, I was so consumed
with the fact that now

16:43.203 --> 16:46.139
my child has this disease.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.674
Cool.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.876
She wasn't shocked.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.844
She was laying in
the bed like...

16:51.878 --> 16:53.180
"Cool, now I'm closer to Mom!"

16:53.213 --> 16:55.182
[laughs]
And I was just like...

16:55.215 --> 16:57.084
"[sighs]."

16:58.017 --> 17:02.555
She had no idea what was
gonna happen after that.

17:02.589 --> 17:03.723
Yeah!

17:04.157 --> 17:05.392
Yeah!

17:05.892 --> 17:07.594
Yeah!

17:08.295 --> 17:11.598
[man] So how long have
you had type 1 diabetes?

17:11.631 --> 17:12.832
Four years.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.734
[man] And when you found out
that you had type 1 diabetes,

17:14.767 --> 17:17.070
how did you feel?

17:17.904 --> 17:20.039
Pretty scared.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.575
'Cause I kinda
didn't like needles.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.744
[chuckles]

17:24.777 --> 17:27.780
Type 1 brought
Emma and I closer.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.917
I mean, we're both
checking our blood sugar,

17:30.950 --> 17:33.620
we're counting carbs, we're...

17:33.653 --> 17:35.722
grabbing insulin
for one or the other,

17:35.755 --> 17:38.591
or doing her injections.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.763
Right before she
was diagnosed,

17:43.796 --> 17:46.899
I rationed insulin because
the copays were too expensive

17:46.933 --> 17:48.601
for me to pay.

17:48.635 --> 17:51.238
There was no
money to buy it and...

17:51.271 --> 17:53.973
I didn't know what else to do.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.910
And ended up going into
DKA and ended up in ICU for

17:57.944 --> 17:59.779
three days...

17:59.812 --> 18:02.782
which costs a lot of money.
[laughs]

18:03.783 --> 18:10.657
***

18:10.690 --> 18:15.094
And then probably two years
after Emma was diagnosed,

18:15.128 --> 18:18.665
things started
getting a lot tougher.

18:18.698 --> 18:22.169
I was trying to manage
myself as a type-1 diabetic,

18:22.202 --> 18:24.837
my daughter as a
type-1 diabetic.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.140
I lost my job.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.109
And then we lost our home.

18:30.143 --> 18:35.148
[turn signal clicking]

18:35.182 --> 18:37.950
When we didn't have
anywhere to go and couldn't

18:37.984 --> 18:42.155
get into the homeless shelter,

18:42.189 --> 18:45.658
we would come to
the Walmart parking lot

18:45.692 --> 18:47.994
and sleep in the car.

18:48.027 --> 18:50.163
I actually would back
into the parking space.

18:50.197 --> 18:53.666
That way, if
somebody tried to break in,

18:53.700 --> 18:55.635
I could take off in a
hurry and not have to try

18:55.668 --> 18:57.204
to back up.

18:57.237 --> 19:00.039
[man] And how often
would you change spots?

19:00.540 --> 19:03.710
Every other day, usually.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.178
I was afraid if I
stayed in one spot,

19:05.212 --> 19:08.014
they'd tell me I wasn't allowed
to sleep on their property.

19:08.047 --> 19:10.683
And then I didn't
know where to go.

19:10.717 --> 19:20.993
*melancholy ambient music

19:21.027 --> 19:22.895
[yawns]

19:22.929 --> 19:24.997
[Emma VO] I've been
thinking about getting a job

19:25.031 --> 19:28.201
to help pay for insulin.

19:28.535 --> 19:32.339
Or at least help pay, like,
bills and stuff, because...

19:32.372 --> 19:34.006
if you're paying for
insulin and stuff,

19:34.040 --> 19:37.877
you can't-- it's
hard to pay for...

19:37.910 --> 19:41.214
rent and all of that stuff.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.017
[Sandra VO] I want
my kid to be a kid.

19:45.051 --> 19:46.586
I don't want her
to worry about it,

19:46.619 --> 19:49.021
and sometimes, I
look at her and I'm like,

19:49.055 --> 19:50.757
"You're not 17, you're 11.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.059
[laughing] Like, let's...

19:53.092 --> 19:55.228
knock it down a little bit."

20:04.937 --> 20:10.743
It's kinda depressing to see
diabetes supplies for a month.

20:11.244 --> 20:15.748
Just what's on the
table, out-of-pocket,

20:15.782 --> 20:18.084
you're looking at
a couple thousand.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.887
It's a lot of money,
it's a lot of pokes,

20:20.920 --> 20:23.222
it's a lot of trash,

20:23.256 --> 20:26.959
it's a lot of a lot
of different things.

20:29.296 --> 20:31.831
It's very exhausting.

20:32.332 --> 20:36.269
I don't think people realize
how tiring diabetes is,

20:36.303 --> 20:39.238
or even how tiring it
is to treat somebody that

20:39.272 --> 20:41.240
has diabetes.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.944
We just have
to find a way to

20:44.977 --> 20:47.246
continue to pay
for everything.

20:48.448 --> 20:50.650
[crowd] [chanting]
Patients over profits!

20:50.683 --> 20:52.952
Patients over profits!

20:52.985 --> 20:53.953
Patients over profits!

20:53.986 --> 20:57.957
You can't hide!
Your drug prices are homicide!

20:57.990 --> 20:59.826
[woman VO] They say that
the high prices for drugs

20:59.859 --> 21:01.328
are just unethical.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.296
[man VO] And that
sparked a weekend protest.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.998
[man VO] Those rallying are
also calling on lawmakers to

21:06.032 --> 21:07.266
pass legislation.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.801

When patients are dying,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.303
your greed is lying!

[woman] When an inflated
price is set for a life-saving

21:12.839 --> 21:15.942
medication, someone is making
a decision about who is worthy

21:15.975 --> 21:17.344
of healthcare.

21:17.377 --> 21:20.146
Kayla Davis had to wait
for her doctor's office

21:20.179 --> 21:22.148
to submit the
forms necessary

21:22.181 --> 21:24.016
to get it covered
by Medicaid.

21:24.050 --> 21:28.154
She rationed the insulin
she had left as she waited.

21:28.187 --> 21:31.724
Kayla died because she
could not afford her insulin.

21:31.758 --> 21:35.161
[woman] We call on the
three-legged monopoly

21:35.194 --> 21:39.999
to cease and desist killing
our fellow diabetics!

21:45.372 --> 21:47.907
because they
couldn't buy their insulin.

21:47.940 --> 21:51.010
[Nicole] Alec died because he
could not afford his insulin,

21:51.043 --> 21:54.013

is on your hands.

22:34.120 --> 22:39.526
Think about what a shame
it is that we've had to...

22:39.559 --> 22:42.194
to go to this extent

22:42.228 --> 22:44.531
to bring attention to an issue

22:44.564 --> 22:47.066
that shouldn't even exist.

22:47.099 --> 22:51.103
All these people have died
because they can't afford

22:51.137 --> 22:54.240
their medications that the
pharmaceutical companies

22:54.273 --> 22:57.410
are producing to
keep them alive.

22:57.744 --> 23:02.048
If you calculate it, it costs
up to 113,000 dollars a gallon

23:02.081 --> 23:04.283
for insulin.

23:04.617 --> 23:07.386
And it's grown; it's now the
fifth most expensive liquid in

23:07.420 --> 23:08.555
the world.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.922
[woman] Oh my gosh.

what the other liquids are?

23:24.837 --> 23:26.405

24:00.006 --> 24:04.611
What exactly is
Alec's Insulin Act now?

24:04.644 --> 24:07.013
'Cause it's been worked
on and modified from the

24:07.046 --> 24:08.080
last time around.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.982
[Nicole] Yeah, it's
been modified a little bit.

24:10.016 --> 24:14.521
Right now, it would be that
if a type 1 in Minnesota finds

24:14.554 --> 24:17.490
themselves in a situation
where they cannot afford their

24:17.524 --> 24:21.494
insulin, that they would
just go to the pharmacist,

24:21.528 --> 24:24.997
fill out a form that verifies
they cannot afford their

24:25.031 --> 24:27.867
prescription, the
pharmacist would fill it,

24:27.900 --> 24:31.470
and then submit the bill
basically to the insulin

24:31.504 --> 24:34.306
manufacturing
companies to pay.

24:34.340 --> 24:36.042
Okay.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.010
[Nicole] And of course, the
pharmaceutical companies are

24:38.044 --> 24:41.514
gonna fight us on this because
they're not gonna want to cover.

24:41.548 --> 24:42.782
[Brittany] So then
after this hearing then,

24:42.815 --> 24:44.884
do they make a decision based
off of that and then that's it?

24:44.917 --> 24:46.519
[Nicole] So they
will be voting today,

24:46.553 --> 24:50.523
and if it passes, then it would
go on to the Senate hearings,

24:50.557 --> 24:54.894
and then once it's approved by
each committee and House and

24:54.927 --> 24:57.029
Senate, then it would go
on to the Governor for his

24:57.063 --> 24:59.031
final signature.

today is we lower the price,

25:45.477 --> 25:49.248
but efforts are all trying to
be thwarted by these companies,

25:49.281 --> 25:54.220
and I just want to remind them
that they are the ones causing

25:54.253 --> 25:55.254
the problem!

25:55.287 --> 25:59.225
Pharma is in these
hallways seven days a week.

25:59.258 --> 26:00.126
[Matthew] Yeah.

26:00.159 --> 26:02.962
Influencing with
their money and their--

26:02.995 --> 26:04.597
-[Matthew] Yeah.
-[Nicole] You know, lunch dates.

26:04.631 --> 26:08.234
So you should know that we are
no longer meeting with any of

26:08.267 --> 26:09.401
these lobbyists.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.103
-[cheers and applause]
-At all.

26:11.137 --> 26:16.275
[applause]

26:16.308 --> 26:19.278
[man] Senator, who's the
chair of the committee?

26:19.311 --> 26:21.080
[Matthew] Uh, Michelle
Benson is the main chair.

26:21.113 --> 26:22.248
Yeah?

26:22.281 --> 26:23.449
[woman] Do you have other
suggestions as to how we can

26:23.482 --> 26:25.985
influence Senator Benson?

26:26.018 --> 26:28.621
Will she hear from her
non-constituents if we show up

26:28.655 --> 26:29.756
at three o'clock?

26:29.789 --> 26:32.124
[Matthew] If, uh...
if you show up?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.059
Yeah, if I show up.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.293
[Matthew] I'll bet
you she listens to you.

26:34.326 --> 26:35.261
-Okay.
-[Matthew] Yeah.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.296
[laughter]

26:37.329 --> 26:40.299
-You too, but her...
-[laughter]

26:40.332 --> 26:45.004
-She scares me more.
-[laughter]

26:45.037 --> 26:49.776
*sensitive ambient music

26:49.809 --> 26:51.343
[crowd]
[chanting] Hey hey, ho ho!

26:51.377 --> 26:53.112
High drug prices got to go!

26:53.145 --> 26:55.147
Hey hey, ho ho!

26:55.181 --> 26:57.016
High drug prices got to go!

26:57.049 --> 26:58.651
Hey hey, ho ho!

26:58.685 --> 27:00.653
High drug prices got to go!

27:00.687 --> 27:02.521
[cheering]

27:02.554 --> 27:05.324
I'm a family doctor, and
this morning at eight o'clock,

27:05.357 --> 27:08.060
I was seeing a patient
struggling to pay for insulin.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.330
People with diabetes cannot be
asked to ration things so that

27:11.363 --> 27:13.032
they can have their insulin!

27:13.065 --> 27:16.202
There are huge barriers in
our way to being healthy,

27:16.235 --> 27:18.137
and those barriers have
everything to do with the cost

27:18.170 --> 27:19.505
of our drugs!

27:19.538 --> 27:21.808
Actually, I've got the
secret to insulin pricing;

27:21.841 --> 27:24.176
-it's in the black box.
-[laughter]

27:24.210 --> 27:25.812
We're trying to find a
way to look inside the box,

27:25.845 --> 27:28.180
and hey, I wonder
what's in the box!

27:28.214 --> 27:30.482
Oh! "Dear Congressman,
thank you for supporting us.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.684
Love, Pharma!"

27:31.718 --> 27:34.220
-Oh, that's in the black box!
-[laughter]

27:34.253 --> 27:38.324
They spend 10s and 10s of
millions of dollars to make sure

27:38.357 --> 27:40.192
the box stays closed.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.161
It's time to open up the box.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.563
[crowd cheering]

27:44.596 --> 27:47.199
The prices have been
so ridiculously high,

27:47.233 --> 27:49.368
and they've been
increasing 'em year over year,

27:49.401 --> 27:52.071
and they don't seem to care.

27:52.104 --> 27:56.408
In fact, they find ways to blame
everybody else but themselves!

27:56.442 --> 27:59.345
And we absolutely need to
pass the Alec Smith Emergency

27:59.378 --> 28:00.512
Insulin Act.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.715
[crowd cheering]

28:02.749 --> 28:04.851
[Nicole] My name is Nicole.

28:04.884 --> 28:08.220
And I am here
today because in 2017,

28:08.254 --> 28:11.557
my son Alec Smith died
from rationing his insulin.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.560
Alec did not choose
to ration insulin,

28:14.593 --> 28:17.396
he was forced to do so because
he could not afford the price

28:17.429 --> 28:20.066
that was placed upon his life.

28:21.567 --> 28:24.737
To me, his life is priceless.

28:25.204 --> 28:28.107
But to Eli Lilly...

28:28.140 --> 28:30.242
Sanofi...

28:30.276 --> 28:32.578
Novo...

28:32.611 --> 28:36.248
his life was worth
1300 dollars a month.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.588
There are only two scenarios
that I can think of that could

28:42.621 --> 28:44.723
have saved my son's life,

28:44.757 --> 28:47.293
the first being
affordable insulin.

28:47.326 --> 28:51.764
The other option would
be a safety net --

28:51.798 --> 28:55.902
a safety net like the Alec Smith
Emergency Insulin Act.

28:55.935 --> 28:59.638
If this was in place in 2017,
I know that Alec --

28:59.671 --> 29:02.408
my baby, no matter
how old he was --

29:02.441 --> 29:04.610
would still be here.

29:04.643 --> 29:07.146
I believe that this
bill will save lives.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.449
I ask you to please vote yes.

29:10.783 --> 29:13.585
Thank you from
my entire family.

29:13.619 --> 29:14.921
[woman] Thank you.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.656
Moving on to public testimony.

29:18.157 --> 29:22.795
Yeah, so I-- we-- I've been a
part of a couple hearings now

29:22.829 --> 29:24.797
where we've heard
pharmacy-related bills,

29:24.831 --> 29:29.435
and each time, there has
been representation from the

29:29.468 --> 29:30.602
pharmaceutical lobby.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.471
[tape rewinding]

29:32.504 --> 29:34.673
Good afternoon, my name
is Christina Moorehead,

29:34.706 --> 29:36.809
and I'm a Senior Director
of State Policy for the

29:36.843 --> 29:39.278
Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America,

29:39.311 --> 29:40.512
or PHARMA.

29:40.546 --> 29:44.183
Each time, it feels sort of
removed -- or detached, rather.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.185
PHARMA represents the
country's leading innovative

29:46.218 --> 29:48.620
biopharmaceutical research
companies that have invested

29:48.654 --> 29:50.656
more than
600 billion dollars...

29:50.689 --> 29:52.658
The argument
from Big Pharma, uh,

29:52.691 --> 29:54.793
is to lead with
platitudes and say,

29:54.827 --> 29:56.662
"This is just not as simple,"

29:56.695 --> 29:58.330
and to point the finger
at somebody else.

29:58.364 --> 30:01.333
Health insurers -- and not
biopharmaceutical manufacturers

30:01.367 --> 30:02.434
-- determine the
price a patient pays...

30:02.468 --> 30:05.972
There's almost a coordinated
theater of these actors,

30:06.005 --> 30:09.508
where they will all
point to the other and say,

30:09.541 --> 30:11.343
"We're not responsible,
we're not accountable."

30:11.377 --> 30:13.379
Pharmacy benefit
managers, insurers,

30:13.412 --> 30:15.681
and hospitals are getting
billions of dollars every year

30:15.714 --> 30:17.984
from negotiated rebates
to pad their bottom lines to

30:18.017 --> 30:19.518
lower premiums...

30:19.551 --> 30:21.553
And that's what
needs to change.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.690
While this bill
is well intended,

30:24.723 --> 30:27.226
this legislation does not fully
address the issue that diabetic

30:27.259 --> 30:30.229
patients are facing in
affording healthcare.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.664
So I-- I'm trying to get
my head around all of this.

30:32.698 --> 30:36.002
What is the cost of a vial...

30:36.035 --> 30:38.670
to manufacture for insulin?

30:38.704 --> 30:39.671
[woman] Ms. Moorehead.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.707
Uh, Chairwoman and
members of the committee,

30:41.740 --> 30:45.244
um, I represent the trade
association and not a specific

30:45.277 --> 30:47.513
drug company, so those are
questions I don't have the

30:47.546 --> 30:49.248
information for.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.549
[Dave] So I guess
I'm just asking,

30:50.582 --> 30:53.585
um, these questions --
and I-- I apologize,

30:53.619 --> 30:56.555
I thought you could answer some
of them -- but I don't know if

30:56.588 --> 30:59.258
you could direct me to who
can answer that question,

30:59.291 --> 31:00.927
but I guess I'd like to
know, at the end of the day,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.029
when there's only three
manufacturers and the market is

31:03.062 --> 31:06.398
cornered, and people's
lives are being affected,

31:06.432 --> 31:09.735
how do we ever get to the bottom
of it if it's nobody's fault?

31:09.768 --> 31:11.770
It just seems like we're going
nowhere 'cause nobody wants to

31:11.803 --> 31:14.606
take accountability
in anything.

31:14.974 --> 31:15.874
[woman] Thank you,
Representative Lislegard.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.410
Thank you, Ms.
Morehead, for coming back.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.280
Further discussion, Committee?

31:21.313 --> 31:24.050
Seeing none, Representative
Howard, we'll welcome you back

31:24.083 --> 31:26.418
for a last word.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.787
[Michael]
Minnesotans are dying.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.889
We weren't able to
save the life of Alec,

31:30.923 --> 31:33.059
but with your
support of this bill,

31:33.092 --> 31:35.727
Alec can save the
lives of Minnesotans,

31:35.761 --> 31:37.463
and I'd ask for your support.

31:37.496 --> 31:39.065
All those in favor, say "Aye."

31:39.098 --> 31:40.066
[multiple] Aye.

31:40.099 --> 31:41.767
Any opposed?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.435
-[gavel bangs]
-The motion prevails.

31:43.469 --> 31:44.770
You are on your way.

31:44.803 --> 31:51.477
*uplifting music

31:51.510 --> 31:52.811
[Nicole] It was unanimous!

31:53.779 --> 31:55.081
I'm happy! [laughs]

31:55.114 --> 31:56.782
-I'm very happy!
-[Nicole] Yeah!

31:58.517 --> 31:59.986
-[laughs]
-Wow.

32:00.019 --> 32:04.623
[Michael VO] Today was the big
first hurdle to deal with the

32:04.656 --> 32:07.493
affordability and
inaccessibility of insulin.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.829
We had the opportunity to
hear Alec's Bill and a number of

32:10.862 --> 32:13.099
other bills that
deal with this issue,

32:13.132 --> 32:15.968
and pass those bills.

32:16.002 --> 32:18.604
They will now move to another
committee and move through the

32:18.637 --> 32:21.340
legislative process.

32:21.373 --> 32:24.476
We have about two months to
move the bill forward and get it

32:24.510 --> 32:26.512
passed into law.

32:26.545 --> 32:27.613
[man VO] Do you feel that
the bill will pass by the end

32:27.646 --> 32:29.982
of the session?

32:30.016 --> 32:32.784
Uh, I'm guardedly
optimistic that we can

32:32.818 --> 32:35.387
pass this bill this year.

32:35.421 --> 32:39.858
But I know that when you're
fighting big interests like Big

32:39.891 --> 32:42.961
Pharma, there
are no guarantees.

32:42.995 --> 32:50.002
*tense music

32:53.839 --> 32:56.008
[Cara] Get one of these guys...

32:56.042 --> 32:57.743
I'm just gonna
bring all of that.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.646
[Cara VO] I was diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes about two and a

33:00.679 --> 33:01.647
half months ago.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.149
Insulin.

33:03.182 --> 33:05.984
[Cara VO] Literally
at the start of COVID.

33:06.018 --> 33:10.022
*mellow ethereal music

33:10.056 --> 33:12.024
I get to the hospital.

33:12.058 --> 33:14.160
The nurse came
and took my blood.

33:14.193 --> 33:18.030
It was really dark
and thick, like syrup.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.866
The doctor comes in.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.569
And he's like, "Well...

33:23.602 --> 33:25.904
you have type 1 diabetes."

33:28.040 --> 33:30.008
My God, I, like, blacked out.

33:30.042 --> 33:33.045
[Cara] All right,
pull the insulin first.

33:33.079 --> 33:35.581
Inject into the cartridge.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.848
Run the insulin through.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.884
-[beep]
-[whispering] Fuck.

33:40.219 --> 33:42.554
Then the insurance woman
comes in [chuckles]

33:42.588 --> 33:44.690
and basically, she's like,

33:44.723 --> 33:45.857
"You have 1 or 2?"

33:45.891 --> 33:47.059
And I was like, "1?"

33:47.093 --> 33:49.728
She goes, "Ugh, you
got the bad one."

33:49.761 --> 33:52.064
[chuckling] And
I'm like, "Okay."

33:52.098 --> 33:55.067
When I found all this out, I
literally had no insurance.

33:55.101 --> 34:00.072
I had a moment
where I freaked out, like...

34:00.606 --> 34:03.075
I don't know, um...

34:03.109 --> 34:07.579
"What if I can't
afford any of-- any of it?"

34:07.613 --> 34:12.584
*sparse curious music

34:12.618 --> 34:16.054
In the US, you really need
insurance to get healthcare

34:16.088 --> 34:18.490
access at an affordable cost.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.592
People around the world may
not be able to understand this

34:20.626 --> 34:21.793
that easily.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.596
In countries like in Europe,
where they have some kind of

34:24.630 --> 34:27.766
either centralized or universal
healthcare or single-payer,

34:27.799 --> 34:29.601
you could be covered completely.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.104
And so, for example,
when you get your insulin,

34:32.138 --> 34:36.475
you just go and either it's
free or it's a low copay.

34:36.808 --> 34:41.113
[S. Vincent VO] However, in the
US, most people get their health

34:41.147 --> 34:44.082
insurance through
their employers.

34:44.116 --> 34:47.085
But healthcare
costs are so expensive,

34:47.119 --> 34:49.788
even if you're fully insured,

34:49.821 --> 34:52.491
you have to worry about the
premiums that you're going to

34:52.524 --> 34:54.092
pay to get that insurance.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.495
You have to worry
about your copay.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.697
You have to worry
about the deductible,

34:58.730 --> 35:00.799
and spend several thousand
dollars before your insurance

35:00.832 --> 35:02.668
kicks in.

35:02.701 --> 35:06.538
So you could be in a position
where your job doesn't have good

35:06.572 --> 35:10.642
insurance, and you could
lose a lifetime savings due

35:10.676 --> 35:12.844
to one illness.

35:14.846 --> 35:16.648
Yeah, it makes you depressed.

35:16.682 --> 35:18.684
[laughs]

35:19.351 --> 35:20.986
[woman in video] This video will
be helpful for you if you're

35:21.019 --> 35:22.821
already on an insulin pump.

35:22.854 --> 35:25.824
I'm gonna go through each
step in a lot of details.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.194
So first things first is I'm
gonna take out my old site and

35:28.227 --> 35:30.996
disconnect just so that I'm
completely disconnected for

35:31.029 --> 35:32.864
this process.
I don't want to--

35:34.166 --> 35:36.302
Always...

35:36.335 --> 35:39.671
pull the insulin first?

35:40.306 --> 35:42.174
[sighs]

35:43.041 --> 35:45.177
[woman in video] So it tells
me to remove the cartridge and

35:45.211 --> 35:48.013
install a new one, so I'm
gonna remove the old one.

35:48.046 --> 35:50.015
So I just use
this little tag here.

35:50.048 --> 35:52.884
So you wanna hold it, like,
kind of on one side because the

35:52.918 --> 35:54.720
cartridge is coming
out the other side.

35:54.753 --> 35:55.821
[Cara] Oh my God.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.155
[groaning] Oh my God.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.857
What?

35:58.890 --> 36:00.158
-What?!
-[Cara] I fucked up!

36:00.192 --> 36:02.027
Just gimme a
second to process!

36:02.060 --> 36:03.729
-Just hold on!
-I don't know, like--

36:03.762 --> 36:05.697
[Cara] I know you don't
know, I just need a minute.

36:05.731 --> 36:07.866
-Just gimme a minute.
-Okay, okay.

36:14.105 --> 36:16.575
[Cara] I'll pull it like that.

36:16.775 --> 36:20.246
Here, and I'm just
gonna give it a good...

36:20.546 --> 36:22.214
-See?
-That made more bubbles.

36:22.248 --> 36:24.082
I know, but it got the
bubble down from there.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.585
Now I'll push
those bubbles out.

36:27.753 --> 36:31.923
[Joe] Last time you did it,
we wasted a lot of insulin.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.091
And this time,
it was just as--

36:33.124 --> 36:34.926
-[Cara] No, that's als--
-You're not looking at what--

36:34.960 --> 36:35.861
You gotta let me finish.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.763
[Joe] The costs are
gonna be long term.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.897
That's where I--

36:38.930 --> 36:40.366
[Cara] For me, I'm not
gonna be concerned about cost,

36:40.399 --> 36:42.268
I'm concerned about my life.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.936
Learning all this stuff
and figuring all this shit out,

36:44.970 --> 36:46.905
I don't wanna
bring money into it!

36:46.938 --> 36:48.173
I don't wanna think about it!

36:48.206 --> 36:53.111
I'm choosing that as a strategic
way to keep my mental stability,

36:53.144 --> 36:55.046
and money does not
help me with that.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.382
That will come.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.617
Do you know what I mean?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.786
[Joe] Yes, I understand why.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.255
But if you keep your head in
the sand on the financials,

37:03.289 --> 37:04.923
you're gonna end
up in that place.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.393
If this is your
biggest worry, do it.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.261
It's not my biggest worry.

37:09.295 --> 37:11.897
My biggest worry
is staying alive.

37:11.930 --> 37:21.072
*soft tense music

37:21.106 --> 37:24.976
[Nicole] Pens, vials...

37:25.644 --> 37:28.780
[Nicole VO] I probably have
about 150,000 dollars' worth of

37:28.814 --> 37:32.784
insulin, and probably...

37:33.785 --> 37:37.956
easily 100,000
dollars' worth of supplies.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.660
People hear about
me, get in touch,

37:41.693 --> 37:45.697
and they send me insulin
and diabetic supplies.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.299
[man] And most of this
comes from people that

37:47.333 --> 37:49.301
-have passed away?
-[Nicole] Yeah.

37:51.303 --> 37:54.673
And people wanna help others.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.943
So I take it, and then get
it into the hands of those

37:57.976 --> 38:00.178
who need it.

38:00.679 --> 38:04.015
Every day, there's someone
posting on social media that is

38:04.049 --> 38:07.018
asking for some assistance.

38:07.519 --> 38:12.157
Insulin is not an option, and if
you are put in a position where

38:12.190 --> 38:16.328
[chuckling] you're gonna die if
you don't get access to insulin,

38:16.362 --> 38:18.864
you gotta do [chuckling]
whatever you gotta do.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.868
I have extra stock on hand,

38:22.901 --> 38:28.006
so I do insulin deliveries
one to four times a month.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.708
-[Chris] I've got five pens.
-[woman] Great, five pens.

38:29.741 --> 38:31.009
-[Chris] There you go!
-[woman] I can really use 'em!

38:31.042 --> 38:32.310
[Chris VO] We
shouldn't have to do this,

38:32.344 --> 38:35.013
but this happens all the time.

38:36.515 --> 38:38.984
[sighing] All right...

38:39.017 --> 38:53.899
***

38:53.932 --> 38:58.336

39:04.776 --> 39:06.344
[door shuts]

39:06.378 --> 39:08.046
[car engine starts]

39:08.079 --> 39:10.882
[Nicole VO] You know, as
long as people are still having

39:10.916 --> 39:13.351
difficulty
affording their insulin,

39:13.385 --> 39:16.221
I'll continue to fight.

39:20.392 --> 39:23.094
[siren]

39:24.229 --> 39:27.399
In my practice, my counseling
for patients with diabetes now

39:27.433 --> 39:29.200
includes a lot about how
expensive this condition is

39:29.234 --> 39:30.368
gonna be for them.

39:30.402 --> 39:32.904
If I have patients who are
traveling outside of the US,

39:32.938 --> 39:35.441
I do remind them about
opportunities to buy their

39:35.474 --> 39:38.944
insulin much more cheaply
outside of our country.

39:38.977 --> 39:41.112
It's really
disappointing, to be honest,

39:41.146 --> 39:44.950
to live in a country
with so much resources,

39:44.983 --> 39:48.554
and still, people are rationing
medicines and deciding that they

39:48.587 --> 39:51.089
have to leave.

39:51.122 --> 39:55.093
To be a medical refugee from the
United States going elsewhere,

39:55.126 --> 39:57.295
we, as Americans, need to look
at ourselves in the mirror and

39:57.328 --> 39:58.930
realize that that's happening,

39:58.964 --> 40:01.433
and that is what the
American Dream has become.

40:01.467 --> 40:06.972
*mellow ambient music

40:07.005 --> 40:11.076
[Sandra VO] For a while, I've
been planning to go to Canada

40:11.109 --> 40:13.111
to purchase insulin,

40:13.144 --> 40:16.314
but I didn't have money
to afford to get there.

40:18.149 --> 40:23.121
But we've been traveling to
Seattle to do diabetes research.

40:25.323 --> 40:30.128
The research department
does pay to fly us here.

40:30.161 --> 40:35.266
And it puts us a lot
closer to the Canadian border,

40:35.300 --> 40:37.469
which is great.

40:37.803 --> 40:40.338
But it's still not enough.

40:40.371 --> 40:41.840
[automated voice over phone]
Your checking account available

40:41.873 --> 40:43.108

40:43.141 --> 40:46.311
3,505 dollars.

40:46.344 --> 40:49.314
Your balance includes two
recent direct deposits.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.950
[Sandra VO] But I
got my tax return.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.885
We're all set.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.854
[Sandra VO] And now, we're
going out of the country.

40:55.887 --> 40:59.457
[Sandra] Vancouver,
British Columbia, 64 miles.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.326

41:08.033 --> 41:09.300
[Sandra] You need
to do a shot.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.636
[Emma] Mm, can't.

41:10.669 --> 41:11.637
[Sandra] You can.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.872
No, I can't!

41:14.740 --> 41:17.375
I'll stab myself
like five times.

41:17.408 --> 41:20.879
Just go ahead and do it 'cause
there's no bumps for a while.

41:23.381 --> 41:25.483
[Emma] [exhales deeply]

41:29.020 --> 41:31.056
I can't do it.

41:31.590 --> 41:35.493
There, I'm slowed way
down, so do your shot.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.896
[Emma] [exhales deeply]

41:37.929 --> 41:40.198
I'm seriously gonna cry.

41:45.571 --> 41:47.205
[Sandra] Now!

41:53.244 --> 41:55.413
-[Emma] [sighs]
-[Sandra] Thank you.

What do you want for a snack?

42:05.123 --> 42:06.892
[Emma] Food.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.229
There's a lot of people
that are still under the

42:11.262 --> 42:14.132
misconception that...

42:14.165 --> 42:18.369
we can just lose weight or eat
healthy and we'll be fine,

42:18.403 --> 42:21.439
when that's not the case.

42:21.973 --> 42:26.411
Being type 1 diabetic, our body
doesn't produce insulin at all,

42:26.444 --> 42:30.716
no matter what we eat
or what our lifestyle is.

42:30.749 --> 42:40.558
*mellow ambient music

Best...

take in the-- [gasps]

-Ohh!

Come on, cars, you
can move your butt.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.109
[Sandra] [laughs] Okay.

42:58.143 --> 43:00.946
Oh, that's it.

43:14.159 --> 43:16.161
You're doing it.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.467
[beeping]

43:22.500 --> 43:24.302
Not well.

43:35.213 --> 43:39.184
Math is easy for me 'cause I
do a lot of math with my blood

43:39.217 --> 43:41.319
sugar stuff.

43:43.488 --> 43:45.791
So much math today.

43:45.824 --> 43:48.326
[chuckling] Before coffee.

43:50.528 --> 43:52.664
For insulin and
medical supplies,

43:52.698 --> 43:56.467
I'll be spending 514
dollars and 84 cents,

43:56.501 --> 44:01.339
whereas at home in the US, um,

44:01.372 --> 44:06.044
it's 2,750 dollars and 94 cents.

44:06.077 --> 44:09.347
And if you take the total of how
much I would spend for all of

44:09.380 --> 44:13.051
that insulin in one month,
subtract all of our expenses,

44:13.084 --> 44:18.356
I'm still saving 1,555
dollars and 10 cents.

44:19.057 --> 44:22.360
It's crazy to think of
what the difference is.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.362
I mean, I can...

44:24.395 --> 44:27.498
come to Canada
twice and still save like

[chuckling] 300 dollars.

the other side of this.

expensive to give away.

we're in Canada!

English money here?

45:25.590 --> 45:27.592
US dollars here?

45:27.625 --> 45:30.295
[Sandra] I think in
some places, you can.

45:30.328 --> 45:32.563
I'm just glad that we don't have
to drive on the opposite side of

45:32.597 --> 45:34.265

-[Jordan] Hi.

45:47.312 --> 45:49.147
Uh, my name's Sandra.

45:49.180 --> 45:52.283
We made some arrangements
to pick up some insulin?

45:52.317 --> 45:53.318
[Jordan] Yes.

45:53.351 --> 45:54.619
Who's the medication for?

45:54.652 --> 45:55.921
-Both of us.
-[Jordan] Okay.

45:55.954 --> 46:00.291
Um, so, um, if you
could actually put down,

46:00.325 --> 46:02.928
uh, which medications...

46:02.961 --> 46:05.330
-[Sandra] Is for which person?
-[Jordan] Yeah.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.464
How was your drive?

[Sandra]
[whispering] Hers is...

46:07.632 --> 46:09.767
-[Emma] Fun.
-[Jordan] Yeah, fun?

46:09.801 --> 46:10.568
-Perfect.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.937
I'll go get
this started for ya.

46:11.970 --> 46:12.737
[Sandra] Okay, thank you.

46:12.770 --> 46:13.939
It'll just be a
couple of minutes.

46:13.972 --> 46:16.141
[Sandra] Awesome, thank you.

46:18.309 --> 46:19.444
[typing]

46:19.477 --> 46:20.946
[Jordan] Do you know what
the insulin's costing you in

46:20.979 --> 46:22.047
the States?

46:22.080 --> 46:24.515
[Sandra] It's quite a
bit more; it's a little over

46:24.549 --> 46:25.450
-2,000 dollars--
-Wow.

46:25.483 --> 46:27.485
[Sandra] For what
we're picking up today.

46:27.518 --> 46:29.821
-That's a lot.
-[Sandra] It's quite a bit.

46:29.855 --> 46:31.622
[Jordan] I don't understand
how people can afford it,

46:31.656 --> 46:33.658
-quite frankly.
-Right!

46:33.691 --> 46:35.326
Yeah, we've had
people fly down,

46:35.360 --> 46:39.197
take a trip, pick it up -- we're
right close to the airport--

46:39.230 --> 46:39.965
-[Sandra] Right.
-And then just fly right back.

46:39.998 --> 46:40.832
[Sandra] Oh, yeah.

46:40.866 --> 46:42.333
And then they
still save a fortune.

46:42.367 --> 46:43.969
[Sandra] Yup, it's crazy.

46:44.002 --> 46:46.972
"Insulin rationing's"
become a household term--

46:47.005 --> 46:48.106
[Sandra] Yup.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.807
-Which is very scary.
-[Sandra] Been there, done that.

46:49.841 --> 46:50.976
-That's scary.
-[Sandra] Yup.

46:51.009 --> 46:52.143
That's very scary.

46:52.177 --> 46:55.813
[woman] So we're giving you,
uh, a box of the Tresiba.

46:55.847 --> 46:56.681
[Sandra] All right.

46:56.714 --> 46:58.716
[woman] And you're
aware of storage?

46:58.749 --> 47:00.385
-[Sandra] Yup.
-[woman] In the fridge.

47:00.418 --> 47:02.520
And then we
also have the vial.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.655
Do you have the
actual reusable pen?

47:04.689 --> 47:05.857
Yes, yeah.

47:05.891 --> 47:07.893
[woman] Okay, do
you need an extra in case?

47:07.926 --> 47:09.360
-Uh...
-[woman] 'Cause it's no charge.

47:09.394 --> 47:10.395
How-- there's no charge?

47:10.428 --> 47:12.230
Then yeah, we'll
take one of those.

47:12.263 --> 47:14.232
[woman] So we'll do that.
Any preference to color?

47:14.265 --> 47:16.401
There's blue and
silver, I think.

47:16.434 --> 47:17.835
Do you want blue or silver?

47:17.869 --> 47:18.870
Blue.

47:18.904 --> 47:21.206
-[woman] Blue?
-Blue, please.

47:22.407 --> 47:23.241
[beeping]

47:23.274 --> 47:24.542
Awesome, thank you.

47:24.575 --> 47:25.710
Thank you.
Nice to meet you.

47:25.743 --> 47:26.511
Thank you for the
recommendations.

47:26.544 --> 47:28.379
-Yeah.
-[Sandra] Nice meeting you.

47:28.413 --> 47:29.414
-Nice to meet you.
-[Sandra] Ready?

47:29.447 --> 47:31.216
[Emma] Nice to meet you, too.

47:32.250 --> 47:33.885
[Sandra] Way easier than
I thought it was gonna be.

47:33.919 --> 47:36.421
[both laugh]

47:36.454 --> 47:39.724
[Jordan VO] It's very rewarding
to help Americans in the

47:39.757 --> 47:41.692
predicament that they
find themselves in with

47:41.726 --> 47:43.028
the drug prices.

47:43.061 --> 47:44.695
In the States,
prescription medicine

47:44.729 --> 47:46.597
is handled like a business.

47:46.631 --> 47:49.034
In Canada, it's healthcare.

47:49.067 --> 47:53.404
*sparse curious music

47:53.438 --> 47:56.607
After I wrote this
article about insulin costs,

47:56.641 --> 48:00.445
I was deluged with
emails from people in Europe,

48:00.478 --> 48:01.712
South America
like, "Oh, you know,

48:01.746 --> 48:02.880
my insulin is free!

48:02.914 --> 48:05.583
My insulin costs
three pesos as a copay!"

48:05.616 --> 48:08.053
And they were shocked
that American patients

48:08.086 --> 48:09.420
have to suffer.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.922
Like, "What do
you mean, you know,

48:10.956 --> 48:12.057
you can't-- you
run out of insulin?"

48:12.090 --> 48:14.059
It was unheard of!

48:14.092 --> 48:15.927
Based on my own
experience with my patient,

48:15.961 --> 48:19.430
I began to learn
about the very dark,

48:19.464 --> 48:22.600
sort of twisted system of
how our medications work.

48:22.633 --> 48:26.437
So, um, it's-- it's helpful
to understand how the supply

48:26.471 --> 48:28.473
chain works.

48:28.506 --> 48:29.807
***

48:29.840 --> 48:31.642
Let's say we take insulin.

48:31.676 --> 48:35.313
For ease of calculation, I'll
say it's 100 dollars a vial.

48:35.346 --> 48:38.583
The pharmaceutical company may
sell it to the wholesaler for

48:38.616 --> 48:41.319
110 dollars.

48:41.352 --> 48:46.457
The wholesaler then sells it to
the pharmacy for 120 dollars.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.793
Now, they kept 10
dollars of the hundred.

48:48.826 --> 48:52.797
The pharmacy now sells to people
who don't have insurance for 130

48:52.830 --> 48:56.467
dollars, so now they
get to keep 10 dollars.

48:56.501 --> 49:00.505
So that's what faces people
who don't have insurance.

49:01.372 --> 49:04.009
On the other hand...

49:04.509 --> 49:09.014
insurance companies work through
pharmacy benefit managers.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.983
Now, pharmacy benefit
managers negotiate with the

49:12.017 --> 49:16.454
pharmaceutical company that "I
will pay you only 60 dollars for

49:16.487 --> 49:18.023
your insulin."

49:18.056 --> 49:21.826
And so, together, the patient
and the pharmacy benefit manager

49:21.859 --> 49:24.996
will pay pharmacies 130...

49:25.030 --> 49:28.799
but PBMs get 50 dollars back
from the pharmaceutical company

49:28.833 --> 49:30.901
as a rebate.

49:31.369 --> 49:36.407
Over time, PBMs have realized
that the higher the price of the

49:36.441 --> 49:40.545
drug, they can profit more,
because pharmaceutical companies

49:40.578 --> 49:45.383
are willing to give rebates
on higher-priced medications.

49:45.416 --> 49:48.019
And now that the
price of insulin goes up,

49:48.053 --> 49:51.556
everyone in the supply chain is
benefiting from a high price,

49:51.589 --> 49:55.693
and the only person who's not
benefitting is the patient.

49:55.726 --> 49:58.863
Pharmacy benefit managers have
all kinds of deals that--

49:58.896 --> 50:02.567
you know, to increase revenue
with the drug companies.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.169
And of course, no one really
knows what these deals are

50:04.202 --> 50:06.871
because they're
not transparent.

50:07.705 --> 50:11.042
You know, these middlepeople,
they're not really doing any

50:11.076 --> 50:13.411
healthcare for the patient,
they're just sort of--

50:13.444 --> 50:17.048
it's just another layer
of-- of bureaucracy,

50:17.082 --> 50:21.052
from which, you know, a
lot of money changes hands.

50:21.086 --> 50:24.189
Diabetes is growing, and so the
market is ever bigger and bigger

50:24.222 --> 50:25.156
and bigger.

50:25.190 --> 50:27.725
There's a huge
amount of money at stake.

50:31.229 --> 50:34.699
[seagull cawing]

50:34.732 --> 50:38.936
[indistinct chatter]

50:38.969 --> 50:42.640
[Tina] So today, we are
announcing the Federal Program.

50:42.673 --> 50:47.445
Next week, on the anniversary
of Alec Smith's tragic death,

50:47.478 --> 50:51.616
I will be introducing the
Emergency Access to Insulin Act.

50:51.649 --> 50:54.919
This type of safety net should
be available in each and every

50:54.952 --> 50:57.755
state, and I thank
Senator Smith for listening,

50:57.788 --> 51:00.891
for caring, and for
actually taking action.

51:00.925 --> 51:01.892
Thank you.

51:01.926 --> 51:03.060
Thank you, Nicole.
Good job.

51:03.094 --> 51:04.329
-Thank you.
-Good job.

51:04.362 --> 51:06.231
[man] All right, we have time
for some questions from members

51:06.264 --> 51:07.098
of the press.

51:11.969 --> 51:16.141
Have you heard any updates on
that and whether we might be

51:16.174 --> 51:18.075
moving toward that
in the recent days?

51:18.109 --> 51:21.812
From the last I heard, um...

51:22.012 --> 51:26.117
the Governor would approve a
special session as long as both

51:26.151 --> 51:29.954
sides -- uh, Senate and House
-- could come together and work,

51:29.987 --> 51:32.623
you know, together
on a resolution.

51:38.028 --> 51:40.798
Those are always
ongoing, yeah.

51:41.799 --> 51:45.136
Thank you for being brave
and getting on board with this.

51:45.170 --> 51:46.837
[Nicole] I'm sorry, but insulin
can't be given out on a

51:46.871 --> 51:50.107
seven-day supply, so how...

51:50.141 --> 51:51.809
how-- that's-- that
will have to be changed.

51:51.842 --> 51:53.144
-Changed, okay.
-Yeah.

51:53.178 --> 51:55.780
Whatever kind of
reason there was for that,

51:55.813 --> 51:56.481
I'm not sure.

51:56.514 --> 51:57.782
-Okay.
-But let's check in.

51:57.815 --> 51:58.783
Okay.

51:58.816 --> 52:00.117
Because we're just
announcing the bill today.

52:00.151 --> 52:01.952
-Yeah, yeah.
-It's not dropping.

52:01.986 --> 52:02.987
-Yeah.
-And even after it does,

52:03.020 --> 52:03.954
-we can still...
-Yeah, yeah.

52:03.988 --> 52:05.656
-You know, modify.
-Yeah.

52:05.690 --> 52:06.924
-But thank you--
-[laughing] Yeah.

52:06.957 --> 52:09.794
Because if that is, in fact, the
case, we do not wanna do that.

52:09.827 --> 52:11.061
Yeah.

52:11.095 --> 52:15.032
The work that you all have been
doing has changed the discussion

52:15.065 --> 52:18.303
around the importance
of access to insulin,

52:18.336 --> 52:20.838
and I'm just so grateful
for what you've done.

52:20.871 --> 52:22.006
[Nicole] Thank you!

52:22.039 --> 52:23.308
Glad to be a partner with
you in all of this. [laughs]

52:23.341 --> 52:25.042
[Nicole] [laughs] Yes!

52:25.075 --> 52:26.677
We need all of the partners
that we can get. [laughs]

52:26.711 --> 52:29.146
[Tina] Yes, we do,
I know!

52:31.048 --> 52:42.327
*mellow heartwarming music

52:42.360 --> 52:43.694
[James] Do you
need more mulch?

52:43.728 --> 52:46.063
-[Nicole] No.
-[James] Okay.

52:46.397 --> 52:49.334
I'm gonna run to Menards
and get some of that filler.

52:49.367 --> 52:50.468
'Cause I'm filling that hole.

52:50.501 --> 52:52.703
[chuckling] Filling the
hole is not gonna do anything!

52:52.737 --> 52:53.971
It is to!

52:54.004 --> 52:55.673
They're just gonna stand there
and peck at it until they get

52:55.706 --> 52:57.242
back in!

52:57.742 --> 53:00.177
[James] Will you
tell 'em to get out, then?

53:00.211 --> 53:02.213
You're funny.

53:04.749 --> 53:07.084
Oh my goodness...

53:07.552 --> 53:09.186
Nicole's, um...

53:09.220 --> 53:11.356
to me, she's my Superwoman.

53:11.389 --> 53:14.024
That woman will...

53:14.058 --> 53:15.760
write up scripts.

53:15.793 --> 53:17.895
Anything I say in public, she'll
write it up for me ahead of

53:17.928 --> 53:20.898
time, because I don't
have the time to do that.

53:21.566 --> 53:24.201
My specialty
is doing rallies

53:24.235 --> 53:28.072
and letting my voice
be loud and proud.

53:28.573 --> 53:31.075
[James] All right.
[clears throat]

53:37.648 --> 53:40.084
[James VO] We should
not have had to bury him.

53:42.653 --> 53:44.922
If there was a way we
could go back in time,

53:44.955 --> 53:47.892
I know it's impossible, but I
would love to switch places with

53:47.925 --> 53:50.928
him and have him here.

53:52.963 --> 53:56.767
If there was a way
we could do that, yup...

54:00.938 --> 54:03.240
I love my son.

54:04.809 --> 54:06.977
[wind chimes]

54:07.011 --> 54:09.947
[James] Every time
I hear them chimes, wow.

54:12.016 --> 54:15.786
It's the partial song
of "Amazing Grace."

54:15.820 --> 54:22.293
*"Amazing Grace" chiming

54:27.832 --> 54:32.303
[Nicole] [sighs] They're
about to vote on Alec's bill.

54:33.471 --> 54:35.973
[man in video]
468, after line 26, insert.

54:36.006 --> 54:37.675
This is the A1 amendment.

54:37.708 --> 54:39.677
[man in video] To the
amendment, Senator Wiklund.

54:39.710 --> 54:44.114
The A1 amendment is
the Alec Smith Emergency,

54:44.148 --> 54:46.183
um, Insulin Act.

54:46.216 --> 54:49.153
We've had a lot of discussion
about it over the past couple

54:49.186 --> 54:51.989
weeks, and I urge
you to vote yes.

54:52.022 --> 54:53.290
[man in video] The
Secretary will take the roll on

54:53.324 --> 54:55.960
the A1 amendment.

54:55.993 --> 55:10.741
[dinging]

55:10.775 --> 55:14.178
There being 33 ayes and 34 nays,
the motion does not prevail and

55:14.211 --> 55:15.813
the amendment is not adopted.

55:15.846 --> 55:18.015
[gavel bangs]

55:19.484 --> 55:21.886
[sighs]

55:22.186 --> 55:24.722
It's so frustrating.

55:24.755 --> 55:28.726
I don't have any patience
for them at this point.

55:30.094 --> 55:33.197
I think it's
gonna take a...

55:33.230 --> 55:36.701
a miracle before
something gets done.

55:47.545 --> 55:49.046
I think this is great.

55:49.079 --> 55:51.516
Are you a fast talker?

55:51.549 --> 55:54.051
-Sometimes.
-[Nicole] Okay.

55:54.084 --> 55:55.520
If I get nervous, I
could be very fast.

55:55.553 --> 55:58.923
[both laugh]

55:59.256 --> 56:00.891
Is yours on your phone?

56:00.925 --> 56:02.159
-[Cindy] Yeah.
-Yeah.

56:02.192 --> 56:05.530
I mean, I ha-- 'cause it's like
the third thing I've done so...

56:05.563 --> 56:08.933
[Erin] That's how I-- I
had one twice as long.

56:08.966 --> 56:11.769
I think if you feel comfortable
that you can do this in less

56:11.802 --> 56:15.372
than three minutes,
then I say go for it.

56:15.406 --> 56:17.074
I know I have to do it.

56:17.107 --> 56:18.909
-[Nicole] Yeah.
-But...

56:18.943 --> 56:20.945
what it takes out of you is...

56:20.978 --> 56:25.249
[Nicole] The emotional toll
that we experience sharing

56:25.282 --> 56:29.420
every single time is exhausting.

56:29.454 --> 56:32.056
[Erin] It is,
and you relive it.

56:32.089 --> 56:33.924
So...

56:38.429 --> 56:45.402
*tense ethereal music

57:26.176 --> 57:27.444
Can I sit with you?

57:27.478 --> 57:29.313
[Antroinette] Yes, Nicole!

57:29.346 --> 57:31.015
[Nicole] How are you doing?

57:31.048 --> 57:34.318
You know, worried about baby
girl and what's gonna happen in

57:34.351 --> 57:35.452
two years with her, you know?

57:35.486 --> 57:37.321
[Nicole] Right.
How is she doing now?

57:37.354 --> 57:39.323
She's in college; she's at
the University of Toledo.

57:39.356 --> 57:41.158
-[Nicole] Yeah.
-So...

57:41.191 --> 57:42.993
-[Nicole] And that's going well?
-It's driving me crazy.

57:43.027 --> 57:44.461
-[Nicole] [laughs]
-She's away from home but...

57:44.495 --> 57:45.996
That's so hard!

57:46.030 --> 57:47.498
[Antroinette] It is!

57:47.532 --> 57:51.001
I'm scared I'm gonna lose
her just like I lost Antavia.

57:51.035 --> 57:54.338
All because she
couldn't afford her insulin.

57:54.371 --> 57:57.174
I was 15 years
old when I had her.

57:57.207 --> 58:00.144
Never once thought that my baby
was gonna be gone at the age of

58:00.177 --> 58:02.479
22 years old..

58:02.513 --> 58:04.515
with a whole life
in front of her.

58:04.549 --> 58:06.651
A whole life.

58:06.684 --> 58:09.319
Have to stay strong.

58:09.353 --> 58:11.321
It's hard sometimes.

01:09:21.358 --> 01:09:24.060
[laughs]

01:09:24.093 --> 01:09:25.895
[Nicole VO] You know,
it can be a lot of fun,

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:27.697
but it could also be really sad.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:30.734
-[James] I love you.
-I love you too, man.

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:31.668
[James] You know what?

01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:34.170
Tonight, we celebrate
the bill passing.

01:09:34.204 --> 01:09:36.039
No one else has to die

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:39.008
because they can't
afford insulin.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:42.045
My son's not with me...

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:46.049
in the body, but
he's in my spirit.

01:09:47.050 --> 01:09:48.585
Long live Al.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:51.255
-[group] Long live Al!
-[James] Long live Al.

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.057
Yup.

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:56.025
-That's a fact!
-Love you, bro!

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:56.860
[James] Love you!

01:09:56.893 --> 01:09:58.562
We're always connected.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.369
[James] Mm.

01:10:05.402 --> 01:10:07.103
Mm!

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:11.741
You ready?!

01:10:15.078 --> 01:10:20.884
[fireworks popping
and blaring]

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.252
Tell 'em!

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.789
Tell 'em!

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:34.598
*uplifting music

01:11:01.291 --> 01:11:08.298
*heartwarming mellow music

01:11:46.169 --> 01:11:57.681
*ethereal music
