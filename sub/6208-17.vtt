00:01.130 --> 00:02.170
Are you sure?

00:02.170 --> 00:05.670
Yes, my incredible sence of smell tell's me that's a caramel.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.530
Uck! cherry Cordial

00:08.530 --> 00:10.830
Really? Maybe you should get a dog.

00:11.570 --> 00:12.900
I need help.

00:12.900 --> 00:15.200
I don't know what to put on Harvey's valentine.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.290
What do you have so far?

00:16.290 --> 00:18.290
Dear Harvey. I don't like it.

00:18.290 --> 00:19.840
I can help you with this one.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.210
Put 'You rock my world' Guys love that.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.980
Maple butter-cream. Yuck!

00:25.980 --> 00:27.540
Who got chocolates?

00:27.540 --> 00:29.860
You did, from Dirk, the mailman.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.070
How sweet.

00:31.070 --> 00:32.890
Yeah, but there are hardly any caramels.

00:32.890 --> 00:34.030
Does this look like one?

00:34.030 --> 00:35.460
Only one way to find out.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.860
Marzipan!

00:38.860 --> 00:40.860
Okay. Now this one.

00:40.860 --> 00:42.900
Quit touching them.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.640
Use a spell.

00:47.270 --> 00:48.050
There.

00:48.050 --> 00:48.930
That was easy.

00:48.930 --> 00:51.310
Yeah. But it takes all the mystery out of life.

00:57.970 --> 01:01.070
1x17. First Kiss

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:16.370 --> 01:18.530
One. Two. Three.

01:20.350 --> 01:23.120
Wow! Yours is so big.

01:23.350 --> 01:24.890
And yours is so... cute.

01:24.890 --> 01:26.670
'Happy Val day Sab'

01:26.670 --> 01:29.270
I thought 'Sab' would be a cool nick-name for you.

01:29.270 --> 01:30.070
Really?

01:30.600 --> 01:31.900
Who am I kidding?

01:31.900 --> 01:34.120
My valentines started out just as big as yours

01:34.120 --> 01:37.200
but I kept trying to make it even and it got smaller and smaller.

01:37.690 --> 01:39.840
But I love it, it's very symmetrical.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.680
Y'see that's what I was going for. I love symmetry.

01:42.680 --> 01:44.870
Things just look nicer that way.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.330
Like your face.

01:47.330 --> 01:49.330
It's really symmetrical.

01:50.820 --> 01:54.350
The Bell! We're late! Um. To be continued?

01:54.350 --> 01:55.320
Yeah.

01:55.320 --> 01:57.320
Happy Val day, Sab!

01:58.820 --> 02:00.930
Well, thanks for walking me home.

02:00.930 --> 02:02.530
Maybe I should walk you in.

02:02.530 --> 02:04.530
Make sure you get to the living room okay.

02:04.530 --> 02:05.920
I'd like that.

02:11.110 --> 02:12.300
Well, here we are.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.510
We made it!

02:13.690 --> 02:16.870
Um. Since we came this far, do you wanna stay and hang out?

02:16.870 --> 02:18.300
It sounds like fun.

02:18.510 --> 02:21.430
Okay. Wait here, I'll just go a see if my aunts are around.

02:23.270 --> 02:24.940
Salem, what are you doing?

02:24.940 --> 02:25.900
Nothing!

02:25.900 --> 02:28.500
You're in a chat-room again pretending to be a woman aren't you?

02:28.830 --> 02:30.500
I like the attention.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.560
Well say goodbye.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.560
Harvey's here and you'd better start acting cattier.

02:33.560 --> 02:34.790
Mean!

02:34.790 --> 02:35.940
Where are my aunts?

02:35.940 --> 02:37.900
They went to the Goya exhibit at the museum.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.200
Did you know Zelda was one of his models?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.650
Didn't know, don't care.

02:41.650 --> 02:42.600
Hey.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.800
Got anything to eat?

02:44.800 --> 02:45.950
I was just checking.

02:45.950 --> 02:47.400
Wow! Great kitchen.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.240
Yeah.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.840
Do you like canapÃ©s?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.140
As much as the next guy.

02:55.140 --> 02:57.140
Well lets go back in the living room.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.180
Oh! I'll grab the cat.

02:58.180 --> 03:00.030
We can make him chase the light reflected off my watch.

03:00.030 --> 03:00.770
No! Er...

03:01.340 --> 03:03.120
He's not allowed in the living room.

03:03.220 --> 03:04.540
Very bad shedding problem.

03:04.540 --> 03:05.540
Really?

03:05.540 --> 03:08.440
Better if he just stays here and minds his own business.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.280
Like I don't have anything better to do than spy on her.

03:13.510 --> 03:15.280
Wait! I don't!

03:17.680 --> 03:20.150
Isn't Annie Leiberwitz cool?

03:20.150 --> 03:21.090
She does everybody.

03:21.270 --> 03:24.580
Oh look at this one! Whoopy Goldberg in a bath-tub o' milk.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.840
I wonder if they warmed it before she got in.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.840
I'm sure. She's a star.

03:29.940 --> 03:30.890
What was that?

03:31.100 --> 03:32.890
Sparks are flying.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.180
You know I don't wanna look at this book anymore.

03:36.180 --> 03:37.840
What d'ya wanna do?

03:39.020 --> 03:40.290
...Kiss you?

03:40.840 --> 03:42.040
Okay.

03:44.830 --> 03:45.890
NEOOO!

03:46.550 --> 03:47.870
What's with your cat?

03:47.870 --> 03:49.900
I don't know. I'll go talk to him...

03:49.900 --> 03:51.590
I mean feed him Haha.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.140
Be right back.

03:54.210 --> 03:55.900
You little sneak! How dare you!

03:55.900 --> 03:57.480
I can't believe you were spying on me.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.280
And it's a good thing I was.

03:59.280 --> 04:00.380
You can't kiss Harvey.

04:00.380 --> 04:03.280
Just watch me, and that's a figure of speech.

04:03.280 --> 04:05.070
But something horrible could happen.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.180
Didn't your aunts tell you.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.180
The sparks were a warning.

04:08.180 --> 04:10.180
A warning? Of what?

04:10.180 --> 04:12.930
You shouldn't hear it from your cat, just trust me.

04:12.930 --> 04:14.870
Do-not-kiss-Harvey!

04:15.150 --> 04:16.870
are you being sincere?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.480
Yes, and it pains me to do it.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.860
Okay, I wont kiss Harvey

04:23.120 --> 04:24.740
but if you're making this up,

04:24.740 --> 04:26.740
I swear you will be neutered.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.740
Slowly.

04:31.640 --> 04:32.350
Yeah?

04:32.350 --> 04:34.650
Ah, you have to go. There's an emergency.

04:34.650 --> 04:35.630
What's wrong?

04:35.630 --> 04:37.630
My cats sick. He needs an operation.

04:37.630 --> 04:39.060
Can I do anything?

04:39.060 --> 04:41.060
No. We're going to use a certified vet.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.960
I'll see you tomorrow. Maybe we can go to a movie?

04:43.960 --> 04:45.470
Sounds great!

04:45.470 --> 04:47.470
Just great!

04:48.130 --> 04:50.350
This ones going on the fridge.

04:50.350 --> 04:51.500
How was the museum?

04:51.500 --> 04:54.310
It's so funny. They're selling postcards of Zelda...

04:54.310 --> 04:55.060
nude!

04:55.090 --> 04:56.620
Well Hel-lo!

04:56.620 --> 04:58.840
Excuse me! It's art...

04:58.970 --> 05:00.820
and according to that guy in the raincoat

05:00.820 --> 05:02.460
who was staring at me, a masterpiece.

05:02.820 --> 05:04.790
Idon't understand, why can't I kiss Harvey?

05:04.790 --> 05:06.080
This is what I heard.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.190
'Rhino hunting man, whick-a-nickis Harvey' Slow down.

05:09.420 --> 05:12.990
I said 'Why Can't I Kiss Harvey?'

05:12.990 --> 05:14.420
Got it that time.

05:14.420 --> 05:17.020
Sabrina, have a seat. We need to talk.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.320
Nothing good ever comes of talking.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.520
You see when a witch kisses a mortal for the first time,

05:22.520 --> 05:24.240
the mortal turns into a frog.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.420
A frog?

05:25.570 --> 05:27.140
Look, if you guys don't like Harvey just...

05:27.140 --> 05:29.820
No! No! No! We like him. Otherwise we wouldn't be warning you.

05:29.820 --> 05:32.120
So if I kiss Harvey he turns into a frog.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.730
It sounds like something out of a fairy tail?

05:33.730 --> 05:35.730
Well they had to get it from somewhere.

05:35.730 --> 05:37.220
Do you think they make that stuff up?

05:37.220 --> 05:38.550
So I can never kiss Harvey?

05:38.550 --> 05:40.550
Not without transmogrifying him.

05:41.020 --> 05:42.550
That's not a good thing.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.640
My life is ruined, I hate being a witch!

05:46.780 --> 05:49.080
Oh-no! It's not so bad.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.080
I went through high school without kissing.

05:56.630 --> 05:58.110
Can we come in?

05:58.110 --> 05:58.840
Sure.

05:58.840 --> 06:00.070
Can we turn on the light?

06:00.070 --> 06:01.560
If you must.

06:02.460 --> 06:05.880
We've been doing some research that we think you should know about.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.050
We checked the handbook

06:07.050 --> 06:10.120
and since you're half mortal there's only a fifty-fifty chance...

06:10.120 --> 06:11.780
that Harvey will turn into a frog.

06:11.780 --> 06:12.930
So it's good news?

06:12.930 --> 06:15.550
well there's a fifty percent chance that it's good news

06:15.550 --> 06:17.850
and a fifty percent chance that it's bad.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.850
It's sort of a coin toss.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.860
Here.

06:20.860 --> 06:22.340
Flip it, you'll see what we mean.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.230
Okay.

06:23.430 --> 06:24.840
Heads: He stays Harvey,

06:24.920 --> 06:26.300
tails: He's a frog.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.920
Tails.

06:30.360 --> 06:31.920
Maybe two out of three.

06:33.650 --> 06:34.410
Heads!

06:36.720 --> 06:37.740
Tails. Ugh!

06:38.390 --> 06:39.740
Why the Ugh!?

06:39.950 --> 06:42.840
Out of a hundred try's it came out fifty heads and fifty tails.

06:43.030 --> 06:44.670
What are the odds of that happening.

06:44.670 --> 06:46.670
Don't ask me, I was an English major.

06:47.460 --> 06:48.670
Who could that be?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.910
I'm not expecting company. Are you?

06:52.220 --> 06:54.370
It's Harvey and I look like laundry!

06:55.280 --> 06:56.370
There.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.370
Chic.

06:58.370 --> 07:00.370
Hi! What are you doing here?

07:00.370 --> 07:02.930
Don't you remember? Yesterday I said I'd see you tomorrow.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.960
And today's tomorrow.

07:04.960 --> 07:07.560
Right. So do you still wanna go to a movie?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.290
Sure. Wait!

07:09.290 --> 07:11.530
They keep those theatres kinda dark don't they?

07:11.530 --> 07:13.780
I'd better go ask my aunts. Stay here.

07:14.680 --> 07:17.650
Harvey's here and he want's to go to the movies. What should I do?

07:17.650 --> 07:20.550
See 'Shine' Everybody's raving about it.

07:20.550 --> 07:21.720
You know what I mean.

07:21.720 --> 07:25.520
I see no reason why two friends can't go to the movies.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.990
Right. Two friends.

07:26.990 --> 07:28.750
Just be careful.

07:29.060 --> 07:31.440
Would it help if I gave him a bad breath spell?

07:31.440 --> 07:33.290
No, I still have to sit next to him.

07:33.290 --> 07:34.910
Can we crunch those numbers one more time?

07:34.910 --> 07:36.360
I checked with MIT.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.130
They're still fifty-fifty.

07:38.130 --> 07:40.730
Well, let me know if they change.

07:41.890 --> 07:43.140
All right. Let's go.

07:43.140 --> 07:46.040
Great. I'm really looking forward to this.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.040
Me too old buddy, old pal.

07:50.110 --> 07:52.720
So. What kind of movie are you up for?

07:52.720 --> 07:55.020
Something with a lot of random property damage.

07:55.410 --> 07:57.470
'Vindicator III' just opened.

07:57.470 --> 07:58.300
Perfect.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.600
Let me help you with that. They're kinda tricky.

08:00.910 --> 08:02.600
There.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.040
You look really pretty tonight.

08:07.630 --> 08:09.740
Thanks, so do you. let's go.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.250
Now is he the real vindicator or the replicator?

08:13.250 --> 08:14.320
Heads.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.320
I'm sorry. What did you say?

08:16.320 --> 08:19.450
It's not important. Whoever he is, now he's dead.

08:20.960 --> 08:21.870
Hey,

08:23.030 --> 08:24.620
you look really pretty tonight.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.600
Oh! Better get more popcorn.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.409
Here ya go.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.020
Heads! Alright!

08:36.049 --> 08:38.340
Why do you keep flipping that coin?

08:38.650 --> 08:42.559
Well if it comes up heads a hundred times in a row I win a prize.

08:43.340 --> 08:45.430
Tails. Stupid eagle!

08:45.740 --> 08:46.680
Hey,

08:46.970 --> 08:49.490
do ya know what the best part of that movie was?

08:49.490 --> 08:51.490
The end credits with the Lou Reed song?

08:52.340 --> 08:52.910
No.

08:53.930 --> 08:55.270
Seeing it with you.

08:55.780 --> 08:57.270
Thanks.

08:57.670 --> 08:59.810
You look really pretty tonight.

09:02.490 --> 09:03.440
Muffin?

09:05.360 --> 09:07.220
Well that was fun.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.430
Best time two friends could have.

09:09.430 --> 09:11.730
Well nothing left to say so good night and gods-speed.

09:12.790 --> 09:14.330
Sabrina! Can we talk?

09:15.030 --> 09:16.330
What about?

09:16.330 --> 09:18.330
Has something changed between us?

09:18.330 --> 09:19.530
What d'ya mean?

09:19.670 --> 09:22.370
Well maybe I'm reading too much into this but...

09:22.370 --> 09:24.490
yesterday I got the feeling that...

09:25.260 --> 09:28.670
you wanted to kiss me, and today I feel like you don't.

09:29.170 --> 09:30.840
No Harvey. It's just...

09:31.360 --> 09:32.870
You see I...

09:33.910 --> 09:35.110
I can't explain.

09:35.660 --> 09:37.360
That's all right. You don't have to.

09:37.930 --> 09:40.770
I mean if that's what you want we can just be...

09:42.040 --> 09:43.270
Friends.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.290
I think that would be the best for both of us.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.370
All right. I'll walk you to the door.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.350
Oh man! I really wanted to kiss you.

09:55.740 --> 09:56.530
Yeah?

10:00.410 --> 10:01.900
You're still here!

10:02.030 --> 10:05.100
I'll always be here for you Sabrrrribit.

10:08.990 --> 10:11.170
I was afraid you'd say that.

10:17.870 --> 10:18.990
Help! Help!

10:19.070 --> 10:20.370
What's the matter?

10:20.370 --> 10:22.190
I turned Harvey into a frog!

10:22.190 --> 10:22.870
Oh-no!

10:22.870 --> 10:24.870
You're not helping with that music aunt Hilda.

10:25.170 --> 10:26.080
Sorry.

10:26.210 --> 10:28.080
I thought you were going to just be friends?

10:28.080 --> 10:31.280
I tried but I failed and now we're not even the same species.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.580
Well first thing first. Let's keep him moist.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.500
And secondly. There's still hope.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.000
Right. The true love clause.

10:41.000 --> 10:41.630
What's that?

10:41.630 --> 10:43.940
There's a test you can take to determine if it's true love,

10:43.940 --> 10:46.420
and if it is Harvey will change back into a person.

10:46.420 --> 10:47.330
And if it isn't.

10:47.330 --> 10:48.770
You'll be changed into a frog.

10:48.770 --> 10:50.620
Aren't those stakes kinda high? I mean...

10:50.620 --> 10:53.140
Harvey's super-cute and I really really like him, but...

10:53.140 --> 10:54.940
how am I supposed to know if it's true love?

10:54.940 --> 10:56.940
Well do you think about him when he's not around?

10:57.050 --> 10:57.550
Yeah.

10:57.550 --> 11:00.330
And does your heart beat faster when you see him walking down the hall?

11:00.330 --> 11:00.860
Yeah.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.450
And does it bother you when he chews gum?

11:02.450 --> 11:03.150
No.

11:03.150 --> 11:05.150
Then it might be true love.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.130
I'm taking the test!

11:07.450 --> 11:08.770
Is it multiple choice?

11:11.960 --> 11:13.250
Where are we?

11:13.250 --> 11:15.250
The National Institute of Love.

11:15.250 --> 11:19.050
Normally it's very clinical but they go all out for valentines day.

11:23.750 --> 11:26.460
Wow! They really take their colour scheme seriously.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.460
I'll sign you in.

11:28.460 --> 11:29.930
Drell should be here any minute.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.030
Drell gives the test!?

11:31.030 --> 11:34.330
Yeah. It's kinda strange us seeing each other today.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.350
It's the ninety-forth anniversary of our thirty-second break-up.

11:37.350 --> 11:38.680
Congratulations.

11:38.680 --> 11:39.600
Thanks.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.600
Here he comes.

11:42.150 --> 11:44.730
Hello ladies, and Hilda.

11:45.930 --> 11:49.340
So Sabrina, you're here to take the test of true love huh?

11:49.340 --> 11:50.360
Yes I am.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.720
The test is in three parts. Each one more horrifying than the last.

11:53.720 --> 11:54.530
You scared?

11:54.530 --> 11:55.340
A little.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.870
Smart. Now you have a standard release form here.

11:58.870 --> 12:02.950
The council is, of course, not responsible for the loss of hair,

12:02.950 --> 12:06.270
dignity or personal items. Just er sign right here.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.270
If you want collision just initial the box.

12:08.270 --> 12:10.270
Oh don't fall for that. It's a rip-off.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.270
What was that?!

12:12.270 --> 12:14.570
You just signed your life away. So. You all set?

12:14.570 --> 12:15.870
Yeah. Where do I start?

12:15.870 --> 12:18.470
Start at door number one.

12:18.710 --> 12:19.960
Good luck.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.960
Follow your heart.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.060
Don't let Harvey dry out.

12:23.060 --> 12:24.360
Come on!

12:25.760 --> 12:28.320
Please welcome Sabrina Spellman.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.390
Oh! What is this?

12:31.600 --> 12:33.870
Part one of your test is the true love game.

12:35.970 --> 12:37.820
Here, sit down.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.820
Would you like to meet your three Harveys?

12:39.820 --> 12:42.420
Harveys? I like this game.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.420
Gentlemen, lets give your best hello's to Sabrina.

12:44.420 --> 12:45.570
Hey Sabrina.

12:45.570 --> 12:46.760
Hey! Sabrina.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.750
Hey Sabrina.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.080
Hi Harvey's.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.760
How well do you know the person you think you're in love with?

12:51.760 --> 12:53.760
Lets find out and here are the questions.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.120
All right. Um.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.820
This question is for Harvey number two.

12:56.820 --> 12:59.000
'If I were a princess trapped in a tower.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.120
How would you rescue me?'

13:00.730 --> 13:03.700
Well the thought of you makes me walk on air,

13:03.700 --> 13:05.940
so I'd float right up and whisk you away.

13:05.940 --> 13:08.240
That's sweet. And Harvey number one.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.140
What would you do?

13:09.140 --> 13:11.140
Blow up the tower.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.420
Okay.

13:13.330 --> 13:15.690
Um. This questions for Harvey number three.

13:15.690 --> 13:19.140
'Describe Harvey numbers one's best and worst feature'

13:19.140 --> 13:21.440
Well he has really nice side-burns.

13:21.440 --> 13:22.460
Thanks man, you too.

13:22.460 --> 13:23.420
Hey, what about me?

13:23.420 --> 13:24.250
They're okay.

13:24.250 --> 13:26.250
Come on guys. Lets just go on please.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.990
Okay. This question is for all of you.

13:27.990 --> 13:29.850
'What's your favourite kind of triangle?'

13:30.010 --> 13:31.340
These questions don't tell me anything.

13:31.340 --> 13:33.340
Nobody said the test would be easy.

13:33.470 --> 13:35.340
Harvey number one, your triangle?

13:35.690 --> 13:36.710
Obtuse.

13:36.710 --> 13:37.670
And why?

13:37.670 --> 13:38.790
I don't know.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.360
Harvey number two?

13:40.360 --> 13:43.140
Scalene. Definitely scalene.

13:43.370 --> 13:46.350
And Harvey number three, what's your favourite kind of triangle.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.270
Equilateral. I like that it's symmetrical.

13:49.270 --> 13:51.910
That's him! That's my Harvey! Harvey number three!

13:51.910 --> 13:54.160
That's right Sabrina and you've past part one.

13:58.260 --> 13:59.590
I passed!

13:59.590 --> 14:00.860
Ha-ha! Congratulations.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.400
Way to go!

14:02.400 --> 14:04.330
Well you passed the test of friendship.

14:04.330 --> 14:07.110
True love can't exist without friendship.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.880
They make me say that.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.130
I'm pumped. What's next?

14:10.130 --> 14:11.250
Um, Door number two.

14:11.250 --> 14:11.770
Okay.

14:11.770 --> 14:13.770
Wish me luck Harvey.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.770
Oh even as a frog he's cute.

14:20.370 --> 14:23.530
Come on Harvey, let's go and check the trellis for bugs.

14:25.850 --> 14:29.990
So. What's new in the life of the most powerful man in the universe?

14:30.220 --> 14:32.390
I finally moved out of my parents basement.

14:32.390 --> 14:33.660
Really?

14:33.660 --> 14:36.860
Yeah, you were right. I-I should have done it centuries ago.

14:36.860 --> 14:39.240
I told you. So you've got your own place?

14:39.240 --> 14:40.050
Yeah.

14:40.780 --> 14:42.440
I'd love to come see it sometime.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.340
Oh that'd-that'd be great.

14:44.340 --> 14:46.340
Especially if you brought some furniture.

14:48.770 --> 14:49.840
Hello!

14:50.180 --> 14:51.460
Anybody!

14:51.930 --> 14:54.350
Is this a test for patience?

14:54.980 --> 14:55.700
Hey!

14:55.700 --> 14:56.430
Hi!

14:56.430 --> 14:57.660
Ah is anyone sitting here?

14:57.660 --> 14:58.540
No. Go ahead.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.480
Great.

15:00.370 --> 15:01.490
I'm Zak.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.790
So are you here to take the test?

15:03.790 --> 15:05.230
Yeah, I wish they'd hurry.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.680
Oh. Could be awhile so you should just relax.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.770
The sun feels good, huh?

15:12.040 --> 15:14.540
Yeah. It's kinda cool to lay by the pool in the middle of February.

15:14.770 --> 15:17.660
Yeah. You know those sun glasses are great on you.

15:17.820 --> 15:20.290
You look like a blonde Audrey Hepburn.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.350
I love Audrey Hepburn!

15:22.350 --> 15:24.350
Which one of her movies is your favourite?

15:24.350 --> 15:26.950
Well I'd have to say 'Sabrina' I just love the name.

15:26.950 --> 15:28.680
You're kidding! That's my name.

15:28.680 --> 15:29.670
Wow!

15:29.850 --> 15:33.170
So Sabrina, are you hungry?

15:33.550 --> 15:35.770
I hadn't thought about it but I guess maybe a little.

15:35.770 --> 15:37.770
How about a piece of delicious chocolate cake?

15:38.060 --> 15:40.040
Wow, that looks amazing.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.940
Oh it is. Here, have a little bite.

15:42.940 --> 15:45.050
I don't know. I had a pretty big muffin earlier.

15:45.050 --> 15:47.350
Ah come on. One little taste couldn't hurt.

15:47.350 --> 15:48.490
That's true.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.490
You look really pretty tonight.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.720
Wait! You're trying to make me forget about Harvey aren't you?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.720
Harvey? Who's Harvey?

15:55.720 --> 15:58.780
Oh Ho-ho! You're a sly one. But I can't eat cake when Harvey's in trouble.

15:58.780 --> 15:59.850
Ah yes you can!

15:59.850 --> 16:00.530
No I can't!

16:00.530 --> 16:01.130
Eat it!

16:01.130 --> 16:01.870
No!!

16:03.200 --> 16:05.440
Well that was the test. You passed.

16:05.440 --> 16:06.640
I did? Whoo-Hoo!!

16:06.640 --> 16:08.640
How about one bite to celebrate?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.640
What do you take me for?

16:13.210 --> 16:16.290
I passed and I got some colour in my cheeks.

16:16.290 --> 16:18.590
Nicely done. You passed the test of fidelity.

16:18.590 --> 16:22.140
You resisted temptation. Something that tests every relationship.

16:22.140 --> 16:24.140
Zelda, do you mind. This is my gig.

16:24.140 --> 16:24.930
Sorry.

16:24.930 --> 16:26.400
One more door and we're out of here.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.380
Not so fast! The next test is really dangerous.

16:28.380 --> 16:31.280
Our insurance carrier requires that you read this pamphlet.

16:31.280 --> 16:33.280
'So you're going to be a frog'?

16:33.280 --> 16:35.280
I'll go over it with you honey.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.370
What ya thinkin'?

16:42.570 --> 16:44.110
You're asking me?

16:44.110 --> 16:45.100
Yeah.

16:46.320 --> 16:49.220
Can't a guy ask a girl what she's thinkin'?

16:49.450 --> 16:50.830
I was just wondering.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.100
Do you think our old flame is still burning?

16:53.100 --> 16:54.850
Well there's one way to find out.

16:54.850 --> 16:55.660
You still have it?

16:55.660 --> 16:56.510
Yeah. No-one bough

16:56.510 --> 16:58.130
t it at the garage-sale.

16:58.130 --> 16:59.380
It's over here.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.950
You open it, I'm afraid to look.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.690
Yes! The old flame is still burning.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.480
After all these years.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.180
You can warm soup over it.

17:11.180 --> 17:13.440
Maybe what we had was special.

17:13.440 --> 17:15.240
I'm going to take the test of true love.

17:15.240 --> 17:16.020
For me?

17:16.020 --> 17:16.839
For us.

17:16.839 --> 17:17.770
I'll be waiting.

17:17.900 --> 17:20.740
Maybe this could be the beginning of something wonderful.

17:23.480 --> 17:25.270
You rock my world.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.020
I'm as giddy as a school-girl.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.320
Say hello to Hilda Spellman.

17:34.100 --> 17:36.560
Right guys. Give your best hello's to Hilda.

17:37.030 --> 17:38.200
Hi Hilda.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.470
Hilda Baby.

17:39.470 --> 17:40.250
Yo Hilda.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.060
Hi Drell's. I think I already know.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.540
Cool your jets. That's not how we play.

17:43.540 --> 17:44.130
Sorry.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.540
Drell number two.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.770
'If you were a condiment. what would you be?'

17:49.770 --> 17:50.570
It's a stupid question.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.900
Ketchup! Ketchup! Say Ketchup!

17:51.900 --> 17:54.900
Mustard. So I could spice up your life.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.740
That's him! That's my Drell!

17:56.740 --> 17:58.130
Incorrect. Games over.

17:58.130 --> 17:59.040
Number three?

17:59.040 --> 17:59.590
No.

17:59.590 --> 18:00.910
Number one?

18:00.910 --> 18:02.270
I said it's over.

18:02.270 --> 18:03.370
No it's not!

18:03.370 --> 18:04.750
Security!

18:09.880 --> 18:11.800
What, no canned applause?

18:12.060 --> 18:13.080
Sorry.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.230
I've finished the pamphlet.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.230
So you've decided what kind of frog you wanna be?

18:19.230 --> 18:21.530
Yeah, I've selected the flying tree-frog.

18:21.530 --> 18:25.030
Excellent choice. Then it's time for the last test. But this one isn't...

18:25.030 --> 18:27.030
Easy like the others.

18:27.030 --> 18:29.030
Good luck and don't be nervous.

18:29.030 --> 18:31.420
I'm not nervous. I mean I know it's true love.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.720
So therefore I have no reason to be nervous.

18:33.720 --> 18:35.720
Er push. Don't pull, push.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.020
Hello!

18:41.350 --> 18:42.790
Is anybody here?

18:43.620 --> 18:44.790
Harvey! Where are you?

18:45.130 --> 18:47.390
I'm not sure. It's dark in here.

18:47.390 --> 18:49.390
See if you can find a light switch.

18:49.390 --> 18:50.990
Wait, here's one.

18:53.650 --> 18:55.890
I don't like this. What's going on?

18:55.890 --> 18:57.870
It's a test of faith.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.870
You have to get to me.

19:00.650 --> 19:03.080
Does the safe road come out anywhere near you?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.680
No. I think it dead-ends in the suburbs.

19:06.050 --> 19:07.680
Then there's only one way.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.810
Scared.

19:12.120 --> 19:12.960
Hot!

19:14.160 --> 19:15.480
Really scared!

19:15.710 --> 19:16.840
Really hot!!

19:18.080 --> 19:20.320
Get back! It's not worth it.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.320
Yes it is! I can do this!

19:35.600 --> 19:38.090
I made it! Oh Harvey!

19:40.280 --> 19:42.440
All that for a hologram?!

19:44.240 --> 19:46.320
I did it! I passed!

19:46.320 --> 19:47.590
It is true love.

19:47.590 --> 19:49.330
Oh Sabrina, that's wonderful!

19:49.330 --> 19:51.080
I have to admit I had my doubts.

19:51.080 --> 19:52.590
But now I can shout it to the world.

19:52.590 --> 19:53.430
I HAVE A TRUE LOVE!

19:53.430 --> 19:55.730
Don't rub it in. Take your frog and go.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.730
But I passed, why's Harvey still a frog?

19:57.730 --> 19:59.410
There's one final detail.

19:59.410 --> 20:02.090
To change him back you have to return to the scene of the kiss

20:02.090 --> 20:02.910
and kiss him again.

20:03.180 --> 20:04.640
I have to kiss a frog?

20:04.640 --> 20:06.110
That is so gross.

20:06.410 --> 20:06.900
Teenagers!

20:06.900 --> 20:09.440
They'll jump through flames but ask them to kiss a frog.

20:09.440 --> 20:10.170
Would you go?

20:10.170 --> 20:10.790
Come on.

20:10.790 --> 20:11.940
Wait! Where's aunt Hilda?

20:11.940 --> 20:13.370
Shhh! Don't ask.

20:13.810 --> 20:16.990
Hmm! Zak, this pecan pie is fabulous.

20:16.990 --> 20:19.190
Even better than the cheesecake

20:19.760 --> 20:21.190
Is that meringue?

20:24.030 --> 20:26.030
Your lips are all slimy.

20:38.990 --> 20:40.230
It worked!

20:40.440 --> 20:41.720
That was great!

20:41.720 --> 20:45.220
I know! That's why I've been trying to kiss you all night.

20:45.220 --> 20:48.420
Can we try it again? I think I might enjoy it more this time.

20:49.450 --> 20:52.530
Me too. I have to admit I was pretty nervous.

20:55.270 --> 20:56.880
Aren't they cute?

20:56.880 --> 20:58.810
Yeah. I'm glad she passed

20:58.810 --> 21:01.410
but I still can't believe you let her take that risk.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.710
There was no risk. I knew she'd pass.

21:03.710 --> 21:04.730
You did?

21:04.730 --> 21:07.350
At sixteen, it's always true love.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.350
Why didn't you tell her?

21:09.350 --> 21:11.010
Because now...

21:11.210 --> 21:13.310
she thinks it's extra-special.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.290
I just found out I don't have basketball practice,

21:25.290 --> 21:27.150
so if you want I can give you a ride home.

21:27.150 --> 21:29.180
And miss getting stuff thrown at me on the bus?

21:29.400 --> 21:30.470
Hmm... Okay!

21:30.600 --> 21:32.520
Great! Then I'll meet you here at three-thirty?

21:32.520 --> 21:33.140
Great.

21:33.140 --> 21:33.820
See ya.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.710
See ya.

21:38.520 --> 21:39.550
Yeah?

21:39.550 --> 21:42.450
It's kinda too bad you don't have basketball practice today.
