Okay, everyone, hurry up and hand in
your Oscar picks before it starts.

MAN ON TV: Ladies and gentlemen,
Scarlett Johansson,

00:56.473 --> 00:58.559
and for some reason, Steve Buscemi.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.853
Man, look at that Steve Buscemi.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.146
Every one of his teeth is
in business for itself.

01:03.397 --> 01:07.776
You know, Steve, the art director's job
is never an easy one.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.654
That's right, Scarlett, but this year...

01:10.737 --> 01:12.948
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm going to the Elton John party.

01:13.031 --> 01:15.951
What the hell? I told you
we were staying for the Governors Ball.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.871
And I told you, Tim, we would
see how the evening plays out.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.457
Peter, may I use your restroom?

01:22.541 --> 01:27.004
I took a laxative and a stool hardener,
and they're fighting it out in there.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.839
Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.050
Oh, boy, I hope there's a scale in there.

01:32.134 --> 01:34.887
I'd like to have a "before"
and "after" on this one.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.556
-I'll be out in a minute.
-I really need to go.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.099
She said she'll be out in a minute!

01:40.392 --> 01:43.478
I hope there's another bathroom in here.
Oh, God.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.691
Oh, thank God, a Porta-Potty.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.027
(SCREAMING)

01:54.364 --> 01:56.867
Dad, Mr. Goldman never drank his Ensure.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.785
Can I have it,
even though it's dinnertime?

01:58.869 --> 02:01.955
Sure, Chris. "Drink Ensure as a meal,
or in-between meals.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.916
"Or when you're on the go!"

02:04.208 --> 02:07.252
-Is Mort still in the bathroom?
-I'll go see if he's all right.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.380
Mort? Hello? Mort?

02:10.464 --> 02:13.175
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing in my room?

02:13.258 --> 02:16.803
Don't touch my stuff with
your dirty walking-on-the-street paws.

02:16.887 --> 02:17.930
I'm looking for Mort.

02:18.013 --> 02:20.474
He came up here an hour ago
and never came back down.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.558
Uh-oh.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.936
-What?
-My time machine has been activated.

02:24.019 --> 02:26.563
Time machine?
I didn't know you had a time machine.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.983
Yeah, I built it after I got bored
with that European See 'n Say.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.237
ELECTRONIC VOICE: The pig goes, "Wenk."

02:34.905 --> 02:38.033
The cow goes, "Sha-zooo."

02:38.116 --> 02:40.410
It most certainly does not.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.789
The rooster goes, "Gickery-gee."

02:43.872 --> 02:46.166
Where? Where does the rooster say that?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.335
The monkey goes, "Ma-cock."

02:48.418 --> 02:51.171
No, no, no, no, it does not.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.590
The elephant goes, "Fwaamp."

02:53.674 --> 02:54.758
Yeah, kind of.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.427
Stewie, do you think Mort might have
accidentally stumbled

02:57.511 --> 02:58.554
into the time machine?

02:58.637 --> 03:01.306
Well, I suppose it's possible.
Let's ask Rick Moranis

03:01.390 --> 03:03.725
and the backup singers
from Little Shop of Horrors.

03:03.809 --> 03:04.852
(SINGING) Da-doo

03:04.935 --> 03:07.521
I saw a red-headed guy come up here
about an hour ago.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.064
Mort the Jew

03:09.398 --> 03:12.317
He seemed to be in a rush
and had a pained look on his face.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.486
Had to poo

03:14.570 --> 03:15.988
Sha-doop-a-doop-a-doo

03:16.071 --> 03:20.492
And he stepped into that box there and
suddenly there was a big flash of light.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.537
That's when he went back in time

03:24.496 --> 03:26.456
Oh, my God, Stewie,
we have to get him back.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.417
-When did the machine send him?
-I don't know.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.210
How can you not know?
It's a time machine.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.088
Doesn't it have, like, a display
that tells you the year or something?

03:33.172 --> 03:36.300
Oh, I'm sorry, Brian, is my time machine
not as good as your time machine?

03:36.383 --> 03:39.595
Oh, yeah. Oh, no, you've probably got
a way better time machine. Yeah.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.762
Stupid dog.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.974
Well, then, can't you just press
a couple buttons and bring him back?

03:44.057 --> 03:46.602
No, he can't just come back.
He needs the return pad.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.896
Well, we can't just leave Mort
back in time.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.565
That'd be more irresponsible
than silent movie porn.

03:52.441 --> 03:53.817
(INAUDIBLE)

04:07.789 --> 04:09.208
All right, we'll go get him.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.669
But remember, Brian, don't touch
anything when we're in the past.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.672
Even stepping on a mosquito
could create a chain reaction

04:15.756 --> 04:17.883
-that drastically alters the present.
-Really?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.844
No, you can do whatever you want.
Come on.

04:30.521 --> 04:32.147
Okay, if everything worked properly,

04:32.231 --> 04:35.234
this should be the exact time
and place that Mort was sent to.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.860
Now, we've just gotta figure out
where we are.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.278
Or when we are.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.198
That's such a douche time-traveler thing
to say.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.116
Sha-zooo.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.745
Okay, we're somewhere in Europe.
Aha! Look, Brian.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.456
This trail of used tissues should lead us
right to Mort.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.541
Or to Quagmire.

And so we had him crucified.
But that doesn't leave this room.

Anyway, the point is,

05:25.200 --> 05:29.663
may Chaim and Sarah have
many wonderful years together. Amen.

We're looking for a Mr. Goldman.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.795
Mr. Mort Goldman?

05:37.421 --> 05:39.631
He's a small business owner.
Tends to whine a lot.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.009
Kind of a hypochondriac.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.720
Oh, no, you can't put your hand back up
after you've put it down.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.555
You know what, never mind.

05:46.638 --> 05:50.517
Stewie, look at this. September 1, 1939.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.728
There's something about that date.

05:52.895 --> 05:57.441
I now pronounce you man and wife.
Mazel tov. Now, step on the glass.

05:57.649 --> 06:02.070
Oh. But be careful, though.
At my wedding, I cut myself on the glass.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.156
And when I got to Palm Beach
for the honeymoon,

06:04.239 --> 06:07.784
I had to put a Wonder Bread bag
on my foot to keep the sand out.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.287
ALL: Mazel tov!

06:12.414 --> 06:13.707

Brian and Stewie? You're in Heaven, too?

06:16.335 --> 06:19.505
Mort, this isn't Heaven.
You've time-traveled into the past.

06:19.588 --> 06:22.132
What? How is that possible?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.259
Just... Just trust me.
We're here to bring you back home.

a lot on anything.

Come on, Mort, we gotta get out of here.

when am I gonna have another chance

06:39.149 --> 06:42.277
to see my Grandpa Chaim's wedding
with my own eyes?

06:42.402 --> 06:43.779
Yes, you know, he's right, Brian.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.114
Besides, I've never been
to a Hebrew wedding.

06:46.198 --> 06:48.825

stay a little longer.

that Rene Russo was born.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.198
It's the only way to get home.

15:06.490 --> 15:10.202
Men, as officers of the Royal Air Force,
you're the very best in the world.

15:10.285 --> 15:13.121
However, this mission
to Germany will not be an easy one.

15:13.205 --> 15:15.832
Four-and-a-half
of every five of you will not return.

15:15.916 --> 15:18.836
Half of Jensen there can tell you,
it gets pretty sticky.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.755
But I never lost me good spirits,
I haven't!

15:21.839 --> 15:23.590
So, let's get up there, be safe

15:23.674 --> 15:27.553
and get back to the big, fat pigs of wives
we have waiting at home.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.556
-Pardon me, sir. I'd like to join.
-What are your qualifications?

15:30.639 --> 15:32.724
I have a British accent,
I'm possibly homosexual,

15:32.808 --> 15:35.435
I never brush my teeth
and my wife is ghastly.

15:35.519 --> 15:36.937
Bombs away!

15:44.278 --> 15:46.238
-Talk to me, Goose.
-Please don't call me that.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.616
You're my eyes, Goose.
Keep an eye out for those Krauts.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.618
Uh-oh! Germans dead ahead!

15:54.997 --> 15:56.290
(FIRING)

16:02.171 --> 16:04.214
(GAGGING)

16:18.520 --> 16:19.897
(BEEPING)

16:47.925 --> 16:50.511
Oh, no, it's another wave of fighters!
We're outnumbered!

16:50.594 --> 16:52.471
Oh, no, we're not!

16:52.971 --> 16:57.309
Stand by, my Hawkmen! Dive!

17:13.075 --> 17:14.409
(LAUGHING)

17:26.839 --> 17:29.967
Oh, my God and baby Jesus,
we're going down!

17:31.134 --> 17:33.303
Quick, get the parachutes!

17:33.428 --> 17:35.389
There are no parachutes!
All I could find was this!

17:35.472 --> 17:41.270
A raft? We're not sinking. We're crashing!

17:54.950 --> 17:56.326
(SCREAMING)

18:14.428 --> 18:16.680
BRIAN: There it is, Berlin.

18:17.973 --> 18:21.268
So, this is Berlin, huh?
Doesn't seem so bad.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.353
Dear God, this place is nightmarish.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.191
Look at the offensive way
they draw Jewish people.

18:29.693 --> 18:31.320
(DEVICE CLICKING)

18:33.530 --> 18:36.366
It's here. The uranium lab is in here.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.747
STEWIE: Hey, fellows.
You want to get a free caricature?

18:41.830 --> 18:44.291
-Ja!
-I want to be a skateboarder!

18:44.374 --> 18:45.959
(PUNCHES LANDING)

18:46.043 --> 18:47.044
(GUN FIRES)

18:50.380 --> 18:51.715
Hey, there's something on here.

18:52.591 --> 18:54.218
STEWIE: That's weird.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.929
All right, come on.
Let's get inside that lab.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.106
Hey, guys!

19:08.190 --> 19:09.816
-Hitler!
-Hitler!

19:09.942 --> 19:11.485
How's it going, Mr. Hitler?

19:11.568 --> 19:14.238
It's a dog-eat-dog Reich,
and I'm wearing bacon pants.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.781
(LAUGHING)

19:15.906 --> 19:17.658
So, how's the atomic bomb coming?

19:17.741 --> 19:20.160
It's coming, it's coming.
There are some problems.

19:20.244 --> 19:21.453
We're having much better luck

19:21.537 --> 19:25.666
developing this impressive collection
of 100 Luftballons.

19:25.749 --> 19:26.750
Oh, damn.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.211
Well, I guess we'll just
let you get back to work.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.879
Oh, I almost forgot.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.257
I don't suppose you boys
have some uranium I could borrow?

19:33.340 --> 19:37.052
Oh, of course. Give him some uranium,
Mean Joe Greene.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.471
Hey, kid, catch.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.266
Thanks, Mean Joe!
He's not really mean at all.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.475
No, he's a nice guy.

19:47.396 --> 19:49.314
Okay, the time machine is refueled.

19:49.398 --> 19:52.734
Let's find a safe spot
and make the trip back home.

20:25.601 --> 20:26.602
(SPUTTERS)

20:26.727 --> 20:28.979
Arrest him! Arrest all three!

20:29.062 --> 20:31.648
These filths are making a mockery
of our Reich.

20:31.732 --> 20:32.858
Execute them.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.904
-Unless...
-Unless what?

20:36.987 --> 20:40.449
Unless they can sing
a charming musical number.

20:42.743 --> 20:44.077
(SINGING) Wherever...

20:44.161 --> 20:47.456
Damn it, will you two
just get in the (BLEEP) time machine?

20:52.377 --> 20:54.671
We did it! We're home! Everything's fine!

20:54.922 --> 20:57.633
-Well, not quite.
-What do you mean?

20:57.716 --> 21:00.260
Aren't you a little nervous
that Mort knows all about this stuff?

21:00.344 --> 21:02.429
Oh, I'm one step ahead of you, Brian.

21:02.513 --> 21:06.099
You see, we've arrived 30 seconds
before Mort came up to use the bathroom.

21:06.183 --> 21:09.978
Only this time, things are gonna
play out a bit differently.

21:13.106 --> 21:14.149
Can I poop in here?

21:14.233 --> 21:15.234
-No!
-No!

21:15.359 --> 21:16.360
Too late.
