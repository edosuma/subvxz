01:08.935 --> 01:10.770
<i>This is </i>Cook at all Costs.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.540
What's good, home cooks?

01:13.606 --> 01:15.108
-Hi!
Hey!

01:15.175 --> 01:17.444
-Welcome to <i>Cook at all Costs.</i>
-Whoo!

01:17.510 --> 01:19.279
-Let's do this.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.982
Sue, Stephaughn, and Beth,
in this first round,

01:23.049 --> 01:25.752
you'll need to create a dish
in any style you want

01:25.819 --> 01:28.588
using ingredients that are being prepared
in the back pantry

01:28.655 --> 01:30.490
by our guest chef and judge.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.026
He's a <i>Top Chef: All-Stars</i> champion.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.829
His restaurants celebrate
classic American fare

01:35.895 --> 01:38.531
from Ember and Rye to Four Flamingos,

01:38.598 --> 01:42.001
the one, the only, Chef Richard Blais.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.137
-Oh, my God.

01:44.671 --> 01:49.943
Oh, my gosh. Chef Richard Blais,
I cannot believe I am cooking for him.

01:50.009 --> 01:55.081
I am such a huge fan of his.
I am shook. Shook, gooped, gagged.

01:55.148 --> 01:58.785
Right now, Chef Blais is preparing
three different ingredient boxes for you.

01:58.852 --> 02:01.087
Chef, send out those boxes, please.

02:08.261 --> 02:09.095
Oh, my God.

02:09.662 --> 02:13.600
You'll start by blind bidding
on these three ingredient boxes

02:13.666 --> 02:16.336
using your bank of $25,000.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.939
The highest bid gets the Spend Box,

02:20.006 --> 02:23.243
which has luxurious ingredients
to help you make a luxurious meal.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.679
The cook with the lowest bid
gets the Save Box,

02:26.746 --> 02:28.648
which is made up of bargain items

02:28.715 --> 02:31.451
that'll need to be transformed
into top quality dishes.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.922
And the bidder sandwiched in between
gets the Surprise Box,

02:35.989 --> 02:37.757
which has unusual ingredients

02:37.824 --> 02:40.193
that'll make you think
and cook on your feet.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.094
Huh.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.496
Ay-ay-ay, they're not gonna make it easy.

02:43.563 --> 02:47.000
In the end, the cook that turns
their dollars into the best dishes

02:47.066 --> 02:49.335
will win whatever money
is left in their bank.

02:50.069 --> 02:53.506
The minimum bid is $2,500.
Please lock in your bids now.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.079
I do not like surprises.
I'd rather just get what I want.

03:00.146 --> 03:02.182
So I am gonna spend money out there.

03:03.416 --> 03:07.820
I love the finer things in life
and luxury items.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.757
So the Spend Box, it makes sense.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.260
Beth, let's take a look at your bid.

03:15.562 --> 03:17.230
$3,000.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.431
Sue.

03:18.998 --> 03:22.035
$3,500. Someone's trying to spend.

03:22.101 --> 03:23.336
-Yes.
-Stephaughn.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.372
-Oh! $3,500!

03:26.439 --> 03:27.507
Oh, no!

03:28.308 --> 03:29.742
Beth, you had the lowest bid.

03:29.809 --> 03:30.710
Yep.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.845
Which means you get the Save Box.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.080
Sue and Stephaughn.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.983
-You both bid the same amount, $3,500.
-Mm-hmm.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.286
But, Stephaughn,
you entered your bid in first,

03:40.353 --> 03:42.322
which means you get your choice

03:42.388 --> 03:45.458
of either the Spend Box
or the Surprise Box.

03:46.492 --> 03:48.628
-Give me the Spend!

03:52.365 --> 03:54.901
Which means, Sue,
you have the Surprise Box.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.470
-Surprise!

03:57.537 --> 03:59.138
I said I didn't like surprises.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.506
I'm sorry.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.076
Home cooks, you have 45 minutes

04:03.142 --> 04:05.378
to make your best dish
using ingredients from the box.

04:06.579 --> 04:10.250
And be ready, 'cause more upgrades will be
coming down the line for you to bid on.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.584
Okay.

04:11.651 --> 04:15.655
Sue, Stephaughn, Beth,
are you ready to cook at all costs?

04:15.722 --> 04:17.056
-Yeah!
-Oh, we're ready!

04:17.123 --> 04:19.659
Great, because your time starts now.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.127
-Go!

04:21.194 --> 04:22.695
Oh, my God.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.298
What is in this?

04:28.201 --> 04:29.135
Okay.

04:29.202 --> 04:30.903
Ooh!

04:30.970 --> 04:32.005
Margarine.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.240
Ooh, mussels.

04:34.307 --> 04:35.842
Oh, my God, some white wine?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.543
Turnips, curry powder.

04:37.610 --> 04:41.347
Wow, this is actually
a really good Save Box.

04:41.414 --> 04:45.451
I'm kind of pumped I got the Save Box
with the bargain grocery ingredients,

04:45.518 --> 04:47.820
because I too work on a budget sometimes,

04:47.887 --> 04:50.790
and it's nice to have things
that I'm comfortable with.

04:51.357 --> 04:52.258
Whoo!

04:52.325 --> 04:54.794
Oh! Oh, I love rosé.

04:54.861 --> 04:57.463
I've got escargot, pickled ramps,

04:57.530 --> 04:59.565
everything bagel mix, ghee,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.701
but the escargot, I guess,
is gonna be the star.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.870
I don't know. I don't really eat escargot.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.972
I'm, like, befuddled right now.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.874
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

05:07.940 --> 05:10.376
Oh, okay!

05:10.443 --> 05:12.712
Prosecco, peppercorn,

05:12.779 --> 05:13.846
hot honey,

05:13.913 --> 05:15.348
duck fat, mmm!

05:15.415 --> 05:17.317
Let's see what this is.

05:17.383 --> 05:21.020
Scallops? I have a shellfish allergy,
and I'm cooking scallops?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.389
Oh God, here we go.

05:23.456 --> 05:27.393
I just don't know what I'm going to do,
but I'm up to the challenge.

05:27.460 --> 05:32.398
I can't taste it, but I can go as far
as to making sure that it's seasoned well.

05:32.465 --> 05:34.667
I'm seeing some proteins
with a wine pairing.

05:34.734 --> 05:38.805
Beth has mussels
and some white wine with the Save Box.

05:38.871 --> 05:43.443
Sue has escargot and rosé
in the Surprise Box,

05:43.509 --> 05:46.979
and Stephaughn's Spend Box
has prosecco and scallops.

05:47.046 --> 05:49.949
-Nice and expensive ones.
-Sounds right to me.

05:50.750 --> 05:56.222
I'm unfamiliar with this one.
What is this? Ginger, I believe?

05:56.289 --> 05:59.292
It's called a sunchoke,
AKA a Jerusalem artichoke.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.027
-Okay.
-Treat it also as a starch.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.730
It's delicious
and has a very creamy texture as well.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.898
-But it's lighter bodied.
-Okay. Okay.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.669
I'm from Chicago,
and my grandmother taught me to cook.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.305
Growing up, I was always in the kitchen.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.441
If I win, I'm going to use the money
to open me up a food truck.

06:15.508 --> 06:18.077
I'm thinking about making,
like, a hot honey scallop.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.146
I am making a hot honey glaze.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.949
I let it sit and simmer
so it can thicken up.

06:23.015 --> 06:26.953
And then, I never heard
of Jerusalem artichokes before,

06:27.019 --> 06:29.922
but I've cooked mashed potatoes
hundreds of times,

06:29.989 --> 06:32.892
and so I'm going to make
mashed Jerusalem artichoke.

06:35.461 --> 06:38.364
Okay, I got to get a focus here.
I'm doing seafood.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.799
-Sue!
-Yes?

06:39.866 --> 06:41.167
How's your Surprise Box?

06:41.234 --> 06:42.168
Oh…

06:42.235 --> 06:44.003
-I'm not loving you right now.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.372
I don't love escargot.
I don't love snails.

06:46.439 --> 06:49.342
I'm feeling a little upset
with Stephaughn right now…

06:49.409 --> 06:50.676
…to be honest.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.547
They're pretty. I love shells.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.549
I had a business for 20 years in flowers,

06:56.616 --> 06:59.485
and I always said if I wasn't in flowers,
I would be in food.

06:59.552 --> 07:00.920
All of a sudden, here I am.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.823
I'm here because I want
to prove something to myself.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.091
I know I'm a good cook.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.960
I'm gonna prove that I'm a good cook,
and people will see that.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.095
Here we go.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.930
I'm making escargot two ways.

07:10.997 --> 07:14.567
First, I'm going to sauté it in the pan
with the ghee and the rosé.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.335
Eh, let's just bread these.

07:16.402 --> 07:19.806
Then, I'm going to fry the little ones
that are already out of the shell.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.474
Okay, at least we got that.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.109
But I'm hoping that maybe something else

07:23.176 --> 07:25.411
comes down the line
that will go with my dish.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.214
It's going to come together.
It always does.

07:33.586 --> 07:36.222
Wow, Chef Blais,
those are some ingredient boxes.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.692
They are, they are. Isn't it nice?
It's kind of-- They're amazing.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.694
Yeah, they really are.
What are you working on now?

07:41.761 --> 07:43.362
Well, I mean, I'm cutting some lardons,

07:43.429 --> 07:45.598
or bacon bits,
if you'd like to call them that.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.732
Bacon adds flavor,

07:46.799 --> 07:49.569
and especially, some of the things
in some of the boxes are lean,

07:49.635 --> 07:52.371
so this is gonna add
a little bit of that fat, that mouthfeel.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.407
It's also gonna add
the best things to every dish.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.843
-That's right.
-I want that umami, salty flavor bomb.

07:56.909 --> 07:58.311
Next, next level.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.378
In terms of the home cooks

07:59.445 --> 08:01.681
and looking for the round-one winner,
what'll impress you?

08:01.747 --> 08:05.051
I am a stickler for technique,
but not if it gets in the way of flavor.

08:05.117 --> 08:07.353
At the end of the day,
it really is about flavor.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.489
Listen. I'mma go check on them.
You can load that up.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.790
-Thanks. Talk to you soon.
-Okay.

08:15.661 --> 08:16.929
-Opa!

08:16.996 --> 08:17.930
Whoo!

08:17.997 --> 08:20.199
I'm about to make me a mimosa.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.370
I'm using the prosecco
to just give a little buzz

08:24.437 --> 08:27.540
to the lemon dressing
to put on the watercress.

08:28.875 --> 08:30.443
And that's pretty good.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.245
I have some turnips.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.080
I'm gonna turn up some turnips.

08:34.146 --> 08:36.349
My whole life
revolves around food so much.

08:36.415 --> 08:38.417
I have a food podcast,

08:38.484 --> 08:41.220
I am a professional food
and product photographer,

08:41.287 --> 08:45.358
and my husband is a professional chef,
but I'm the one who does all the cooking,

08:45.424 --> 08:48.694
and I have, like, obscene amount
of kitchen confidence.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.062
I'm pumped.

08:50.129 --> 08:52.298
I'm, like, wicked pumped
about the Save Box.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.101
Wine and mussels
are a match made in heaven.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.970
I have total clarity
of where this dish is going.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.439
It is a white wine mussel dish

09:00.506 --> 09:02.041
with some curry flavor,

09:02.108 --> 09:03.743
sautéed beet greens,

09:03.809 --> 09:05.978
and I'm grating my turnips and thinking,

09:06.045 --> 09:10.216
"Let's deep-fry this son of a gun
and make some crispy 'turnip hay.'"

09:10.283 --> 09:14.220
Shut the front door.
Is that a new thing? I think it might be.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.490
But I really need some kind of bread,

09:17.557 --> 09:21.727
something that's gonna sop up
this beautiful, mussely white wine broth,

09:21.794 --> 09:25.498
and I know I didn't spend
as much money as my competitors did,

09:25.565 --> 09:28.034
and so now I have
an opportunity to spend a little

09:28.100 --> 09:29.535
to make the dish complete.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.415
Home cooks, auctions coming!

09:42.481 --> 09:44.050
-All right!
-Oh, boy.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.718
What do we got? What do we got?

09:46.919 --> 09:52.158
The first item
up for auction is jasmine rice.

09:52.224 --> 09:55.728
Fry it, crisp it up,
give me some little socarrat on the base,

09:55.795 --> 09:56.896
steam it. Mmm!

09:57.530 --> 09:59.899
I need this jasmine rice
because I can put it

09:59.966 --> 10:01.567
underneath my escargot.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.269
Jasmine rice, who wants some?

10:03.336 --> 10:04.303
Do I have $500?

10:04.370 --> 10:05.571
-$600?

10:06.138 --> 10:09.041
You sure? Wow, all right. $500 going once.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.243
-Take it, Sue.
-$500 going twice.

10:11.310 --> 10:14.780
-Jasmine rice sold to Sue! $500.
-All right, Sue.

10:14.847 --> 10:17.049
-Get it, girl!
-Thank you. Thank you.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.718
-Ooh, rice. Mmm!
-Thank you.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.289
All right. Next item up for auction is…

10:24.457 --> 10:26.359
bacon lardon.

10:26.425 --> 10:30.229
So salty, fatty, delicious,
and adds so much flavor.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.532
Bacon and mussels are
a great flavor combination together.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.600
I'm going for it.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.302
All right, bidding will start at $800.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.538
-Do I have $900?

10:39.605 --> 10:40.806
-$1,200?

10:40.873 --> 10:42.174
-Fifteen?

10:42.241 --> 10:44.477
-We got a bidding war! A bidding war!
-Come on!

10:45.044 --> 10:47.313
I want that bacon.
I want a little bite for myself.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.650
But $1,500? Beth, you can have the bacon.

10:50.716 --> 10:52.718
-Sold to Beth.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.420
Good job, Beth. Good job.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.023
Bacon.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.358
For our final auction item, we have…

11:00.059 --> 11:01.727
ooh, a lovely baguette.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.596
Jackpot. It's mine.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.298
Who doesn't love crusty sourdough?

11:06.365 --> 11:08.401
I've got my seafood.
I'm getting the baguette.

11:08.467 --> 11:10.603
-Bidding starts at $700.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.538
-Do I have $800?

11:12.605 --> 11:14.940
What do you want with the bread, Sue?

11:15.007 --> 11:17.610
Sue doesn't need the baguette.
Sue got the rice.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.246
Sue has a starch. I need a starch.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.181
-Do I have $1,000?

11:22.248 --> 11:23.582
-$1,200?

11:23.649 --> 11:26.285
-Do I have $1,500?
-I got me some bacon.

11:26.352 --> 11:30.056
Oh, my God. I don't want to pay
$1,500 for a baguette.

11:30.122 --> 11:34.560
$1,200 going once, $1,200 going twice…

11:34.627 --> 11:39.899
Sold to Sue! Two pieces of bread.
$600 per piece.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.467
That's pretty expensive bread.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.936
Enjoy your $600 toast, Sue.

11:44.003 --> 11:45.571
That bread cost you some dough.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.039
-I know, I know!

11:47.106 --> 11:50.643
Don't worry. Don't worry. Don't worry.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.445
I'm feeling really good
about getting the rice

11:52.511 --> 11:54.480
and the beautiful, crusty sourdough bread.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.517
I mean, rice goes
with seafood and my flavors, so…

11:58.584 --> 12:00.419
I know exactly
what I'm gonna do with them.

12:00.486 --> 12:04.190
My thought is put the rice on the base
underneath my escargot.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.325
Got to make good food.

12:06.392 --> 12:10.196
And then do a little sourdough bread
on the side. No-brainer.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.531
Everybody good over there?

12:12.598 --> 12:14.433
-You talking to me?
-Yeah.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.102
Miss I Take Your Bread.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.806
I really do wish that I won the baguette.

12:20.873 --> 12:24.343
I'm gonna attempt something.
We are gonna candy some bacon.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.912
I spent $1,500 on these lardons,

12:26.979 --> 12:29.315
so I really wanna make
the most out of this ingredient.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.617
So I'm going to candy them

12:31.684 --> 12:35.121
with a little bit of the grapefruit zest
and some sugar

12:35.187 --> 12:37.356
for a little bit of crispy texture
in the dish.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.558
Let's make some bacon candy.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.096
I'm gonna check
and see how these are going.

12:44.163 --> 12:48.734
I didn't spend any money in the auction
because I'm trying to save my bread.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.603
Mo' money, mo' problems.

12:50.669 --> 12:56.408
I'm seasoning the Jerusalem artichoke mash
using salt and dukkah spice.

12:56.475 --> 12:58.611
I love a little sweetness and spice.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.579
Time to use this duck fat.

13:00.646 --> 13:02.381
Duck fat. He got duck fat?

13:03.382 --> 13:07.553
I'm using the duck fat
to cook the scallops in for some flavor.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.223
Five minutes left, home cooks.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.661
I'm a little apprehensive
about the scallops

13:15.728 --> 13:17.696
because I can't taste these.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.398
Oh, my God.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.901
But I know
that they have to be golden brown,

13:21.967 --> 13:25.638
so I know I needed, like,
a tight sear on both sides.

13:25.704 --> 13:27.139
I am feeling the pressure.

13:27.706 --> 13:31.443
Two minutes left.
You have two minutes left.

13:31.510 --> 13:32.611
What?

13:32.678 --> 13:34.914
Plates need to go on the line,

13:34.980 --> 13:37.850
and hit the red button
before time runs out.

13:37.917 --> 13:39.351
Okay, I'm-- Look, I'm gonna make it.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.954
I'm most nervous about my escargot.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.923
Who wants to eat that many? Nobody.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.225
But the plate looks beautiful.

13:46.292 --> 13:49.795
I did the escargot in the shell,
and then I used 'em out of the shells.

13:49.862 --> 13:52.832
So I'm thinking Chef Blais,
he's going to like the look of it.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.633
I don't know if he's gonna like the taste.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.803
Home cooks,
you have one minute left.

13:57.870 --> 14:00.072
So I'm
a professional food photographer,

14:00.139 --> 14:02.508
and as I'm plating this,
I'm looking down, thinking,

14:03.108 --> 14:05.177
"You know, this isn't half bad."

14:05.244 --> 14:06.412
This is really good.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.747
The mussels, the white wine,

14:08.814 --> 14:11.984
sautéed beet greens
with the candied bacon,

14:12.051 --> 14:15.120
and the turnip hay
to garnish it beautifully.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.224
I'm not nervous at all.
I-- I'm-- I got this.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.995
Ten, nine, eight, seven…

14:23.062 --> 14:25.664
-…six, five…

14:25.731 --> 14:27.333
-…four, three,

14:27.399 --> 14:29.401
-two, one.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.838
-Good job! Yeah, take a sip.

14:32.905 --> 14:34.406
-All right, Sue.

14:38.177 --> 14:41.447
I'm sending your plates down the line
to Chef Blais for a tasting.

14:41.513 --> 14:42.982
Oh, my God.

14:43.048 --> 14:46.151
Chef Blais is a big deal.
I don't know how he's gonna like my food.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.587
I hope he does. I hope I can impress him.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.225
Whoo!

14:53.292 --> 14:56.562
-That's a fun set of home cooks.
-Okay, all right. Well, that's good.

14:56.629 --> 14:58.130
-You ready to dive in?
-I mean, yeah.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.633
But first of all, I want one,
the belt, for my house.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.568
Just roll 'em down this way.
I like it. Okay.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.471
Uh, all right, first dish,
you have pan-seared scallops

15:05.537 --> 15:07.573
with a Jerusalem artichoke mash

15:07.640 --> 15:09.208
and a watercress salad.

15:10.342 --> 15:12.077
This home cook is allergic to shellfish,

15:12.144 --> 15:14.613
so they weren't able
to taste the scallops.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.015
How's the cook on the scallop?

15:16.081 --> 15:17.950
Temperature-wise,
it's really good.

15:18.017 --> 15:20.052
They're delicious,
they were cooked really well.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.220
That's gotta be really hard,

15:21.287 --> 15:22.988
if you're allergic to something,
to cook it.

15:23.555 --> 15:26.625
It's more impressive,
but scallops themselves are pretty sweet.

15:26.692 --> 15:30.796
So when you put honey on top of them,
it makes it a little maybe too sweet.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.598
And the sunchokes,
the Jerusalem artichokes,

15:32.665 --> 15:34.967
a little bit of salt,
there's not really any on the mash,

15:35.034 --> 15:36.201
or not enough for me.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.271
And in the presentation,
it could use a little bit more cohesion.

15:39.338 --> 15:43.008
You're looking for that perfect bite,
and here, it's just not all together.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.477
Just minor execution.
There's promise here.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.414
All right, Chef. Next one?

15:48.480 --> 15:49.882
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.052
This dish is curried white-wine mussels

15:53.118 --> 15:54.753
with sautéed beet greens,

15:54.820 --> 15:57.489
turnip hay, and candied lardon.

15:57.556 --> 15:59.725
-This person got the lardons.
-Yep.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.528
So I'm assuming they paid a hefty price.

16:02.594 --> 16:04.129
$1,500.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.732
-$1,500?
-For bacon.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.933
Oh, my gosh.

16:09.935 --> 16:12.304
-I can definitely taste the curry.
-Yeah.

16:12.371 --> 16:14.506
I love the amount of curry
that's in here, actually.

16:14.573 --> 16:16.575
-Oh, wow. Okay.
-This is a tasty dish.

16:16.642 --> 16:20.479
I love that it's got
this umami, uh, saline-forward taste,

16:20.546 --> 16:23.148
and the lardons
definitely take it to the next level.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.416
So, money well spent.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.619
But traditionally,
you want bread to sort of sop up

16:27.686 --> 16:30.089
all of this delicious juice in this broth.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.591
You sent baguette down the line.
They could've had bread,

16:32.658 --> 16:33.993
if this is what they're going for.

16:34.059 --> 16:34.994
Would've been fantastic.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.763
Do you feel
that this dish was elevated enough?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.699
You got turnip hay on this dish, Jordan!

16:40.766 --> 16:43.869
You got the lardons in there.
It's not just white-wine mussels.

16:43.936 --> 16:46.572
I think it was elevated. Overall,
this is a really, really good dish.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.009
All right, Chef. This dish here,

16:50.075 --> 16:52.177
we've got escargot two ways.

16:52.244 --> 16:54.113
One that's crispy-fried with rice,

16:54.179 --> 16:56.548
and the other
that's steamed in a rosé sauce

16:56.615 --> 16:59.251
with some toasted sourdough on the side.

16:59.318 --> 17:01.920
This home cook purchased
two of the upgrades,

17:01.987 --> 17:03.655
the jasmine rice and the baguette.

17:03.722 --> 17:07.059
They doubled down on the starch.
We're going carbs. We got rice.

17:11.163 --> 17:15.434
Here's the interesting thing.
Snails, chewy, springy…

17:15.501 --> 17:16.602
Yeah.

17:16.668 --> 17:19.371
-Not anything like the way these taste.
-Really?

17:19.438 --> 17:22.608
-These are soft and tender.
-Wow.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.811
I'm kind of shocked. I'm… shell-shocked.

17:27.312 --> 17:28.180
Let's see.

17:30.482 --> 17:32.551
The second one is even better!

17:32.618 --> 17:33.685
This is delicious.

17:33.752 --> 17:35.921
You get the buttery flavor from the ghee.

17:35.988 --> 17:37.756
Everyone loves rice and butter.

17:37.823 --> 17:40.726
I'm-- I'm not really a big snail guy.
I am now.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.429
But I don't think
you needed the baguette and the rice.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.899
I did too much here,
but certainly a delicious dish.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.936
-So, Chef, do you think you have a winner?
-I do.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.871
-All right, I'll go let them know.
-Okay.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.678
Home cooks, it's result time.

18:01.146 --> 18:04.016
The home cook
with the best out-of-the-box dish is…

18:08.487 --> 18:09.888
-Sue!

18:13.692 --> 18:15.060
Congratulations.

18:17.296 --> 18:18.730
I feel amazing.

18:18.797 --> 18:22.267
Like, this is what I came for,
but I didn't think it was gonna happen.

18:22.334 --> 18:24.336
But it did. This is awesome.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.338
Thank you so much.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.309
Home cooks, our final round is inspired

18:30.375 --> 18:34.947
by Chef Blais's love for decadent
and drool-worthy cuisine,

18:35.013 --> 18:36.515
the great American diner.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.152
It's classic comfort food.
It's classic American.

18:40.986 --> 18:42.821
Working with ingredient boxes

18:42.888 --> 18:45.390
that are being prepared right now
by Chef Blais,

18:45.457 --> 18:47.626
you'll need to create
your best diner dish.

18:48.227 --> 18:52.331
Diners to me are like a hug
in your tummy. Let's do this.

18:52.397 --> 18:56.335
Chef Blais, order up!
Send out those boxes.

19:00.139 --> 19:03.742
Home cooks, in this round,
the boxes have set prices.

19:04.710 --> 19:07.513
The Spend Box will cost you $8,000,

19:07.579 --> 19:10.716
the Save Box will cost you $4,000,

19:10.782 --> 19:13.485
and the Surprise Box will run you $6,000.

19:13.552 --> 19:15.821
Sue, because you won the first round,

19:15.888 --> 19:19.992
you have the power to assign
any box to whichever cook you'd like.

19:20.058 --> 19:20.993
Oof.

19:21.059 --> 19:22.027
Price tag included.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.195
Love you!

19:23.262 --> 19:25.464
-I love you, Mama!

19:25.531 --> 19:26.865
Let me feel the love.

19:26.932 --> 19:29.535
Sue, which of the three boxes
would you like?

19:29.601 --> 19:30.769
I would like the Save.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.172
I'm picking the Save Box,

19:33.238 --> 19:36.308
because I wanna go home from this game
with some cash in my pocket.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.980
Now, who would you like
to assign the Spend Box to

19:42.047 --> 19:44.049
along with its $8,000 price tag?

19:46.385 --> 19:47.686
I-- I'm gonna give it to Beth.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.688
I still love you.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.724
-Let's make it rain. It's all good.
-You got it, Beth.

19:52.791 --> 19:56.061
That means, Stephaughn,
you get the Surprise Box.

19:56.128 --> 20:00.399
I'm giving Stephaughn the Surprise Box
because he gave it to me in round one.

20:00.465 --> 20:04.236
I'm not really a vengeful person,
but now we're even.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.105
Okay. Touché. She's getting me back.

20:09.107 --> 20:12.711
Home cooks, keep an eye on the line
for more tasty ingredient upgrades,

20:12.778 --> 20:15.881
and remember, whoever makes
the best diner dish

20:15.948 --> 20:18.617
goes home with all the cash
remaining in their bank.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.154
You have 45 minutes on the clock,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.423
and the time has come again

20:24.990 --> 20:27.459
to cook at all costs. Go!

20:32.431 --> 20:35.334
What do I have? Beef consommé,

20:35.400 --> 20:37.102
prime strip,

20:37.169 --> 20:38.503
yummy bread,

20:38.570 --> 20:41.173
cute little gem lettuces.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.507
I open the Spend Box,

20:42.574 --> 20:44.743
and I could not have a better box.

20:44.810 --> 20:46.178
Oh!

20:46.245 --> 20:47.779
But it's throwing me off,

20:47.846 --> 20:50.148
because I'm supposed to make a diner dish,

20:50.215 --> 20:53.285
but these ingredients, they're so luxe.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.887
This is a fancy diner meal for sure.

20:55.954 --> 20:58.523
Okay. Romaine lettuce,

20:58.590 --> 21:00.792
ooh, cheese curds,

21:00.859 --> 21:02.794
chicken noodle soup, okay.

21:02.861 --> 21:04.363
Beef liver?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.866
Oh, my God!

21:07.933 --> 21:10.269
What am I going to do
with this beef liver?

21:10.335 --> 21:11.169
Thank you, Sue.

21:13.138 --> 21:14.339
Okay, I got the Save Box.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.375
Now, I have nice bread, perfect.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.909
Pickles. Love pickles.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.578
Turkey breast.

21:19.645 --> 21:20.779
Cheese spread.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.481
I'll worry about that later.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.784
I see the ingredients, and, I mean,
I don't wanna sound too confident,

21:25.851 --> 21:27.452
but I got this.

21:27.519 --> 21:28.954
I got a plan.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.390
Let's go.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.059
I have lettuce, got pickles.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.061
I'm making the classic turkey club.

21:36.128 --> 21:38.463
What is that? Broccoli soup mix.

21:38.530 --> 21:42.534
Got the soup, the sandwich,
and it's classic diner comfort food.

21:42.601 --> 21:45.637
Going to try to do a soup and a sandwich,
but I need cream or something

21:45.704 --> 21:47.906
for that broccoli soup,
which I don't think I have.

21:49.975 --> 21:53.011
All right, we now have the proteins out.

21:53.078 --> 21:57.316
Sue with the Save Box has got
some turkey breast, typical diner.

21:57.382 --> 22:00.519
Beth spending on some prime sirloin.

22:00.585 --> 22:01.453
Ooh, you fancy!

22:01.520 --> 22:04.122
And Stephaughn, surprise, surprise.

22:04.189 --> 22:06.525
-Beef liver in the Surprise Box.
-Yes.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.795
I've never prepared beef liver before,

22:09.861 --> 22:13.398
so I'm thinking that pan-frying it
is the safest method.

22:14.199 --> 22:18.770
To me, American Diner means
burgers, soups, sandwiches.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.906
And I have this marble rye bread.

22:21.406 --> 22:25.143
So I'm thinking
an open-faced beef liver sandwich.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.880
And I have chicken noodle soup in my box,
so I'm going to use it

22:28.947 --> 22:32.351
to make a gravy to add some more flavor
on top of my sandwich.

22:32.417 --> 22:36.288
But I really need to figure out
a side to complete my dish.

22:39.224 --> 22:42.594
-Whoo! Whoa. What are you working on?
-Yes. Came at the right time, Jordan.

22:42.661 --> 22:44.863
There it is,
a little bit of truffle aioli.

22:44.930 --> 22:48.667
We got American diner classics here.
What do you think aioli can add to this?

22:48.734 --> 22:51.970
Oh, my gosh!
Aioli brings so many things together.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.039
First of all, mayonnaise,
my favorite condiment.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.307
It's going to give some fat.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.009
It's going to give
contrast of, uh, texture.

22:58.076 --> 23:00.112
It's like a glue.
It connects, literally, the bread,

23:00.178 --> 23:02.347
and whatever, the meat,
veg, whatever. I'm in.

23:02.914 --> 23:06.284
Now, do you expect these home cooks
to give you elevated diner food

23:06.351 --> 23:08.553
or just maybe something
using those ingredients?

23:08.620 --> 23:09.654
What are you looking for?

23:09.721 --> 23:11.690
Again, I think
because the theme is so clear,

23:11.757 --> 23:14.292
it's gotta be something
that you know you <i>could </i>get in a diner,

23:14.359 --> 23:15.427
but then elevated.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.797
And I got lots of exciting things
coming down the belt.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.966
-All right, cool. Can't wait to see them.
-All right.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.371
That is a beautiful piece of beef.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.275
When I think American classic diner,
I think breakfast.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.711
I always want to have breakfast food
when I'm at a diner.

23:32.778 --> 23:38.083
So I have this beautiful sirloin
that I'm going to grill,

23:38.150 --> 23:39.985
but I really need some eggs.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.988
Breakfast without eggs,
it's not happening.

23:43.054 --> 23:46.358
So I just need to hope
that something's coming down the line.

23:50.462 --> 23:53.432
-Auction time, home cooks!
-I've been waiting on that.

23:54.099 --> 23:57.302
Time to spend some money.

23:58.136 --> 24:00.405
First item screams diner,

24:00.939 --> 24:02.307
macaroni and milk.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.410
I need something
to go with my beef liver sandwich.

24:05.477 --> 24:10.115
So I've never been so happy
to see macaroni and milk.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.851
I need some kind of milk or cream
for my soup,

24:12.918 --> 24:14.486
and I'm ready to start bidding.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.588
-Do I have $1,000?

24:16.655 --> 24:17.489
$1,000 to Sue.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.590
-$1,200.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.827
-All right, do I have $1,400?
-I need it.

24:21.893 --> 24:23.595
Sue, do not try me.

24:23.662 --> 24:26.064
-This is my macaroni and milk.

24:26.131 --> 24:29.234
All right, that's $1,600
to you, Stephaughn.

24:29.301 --> 24:33.472
$1,600 going once, $1,600 going twice…

24:33.538 --> 24:35.474
Sold to Stephaughn!

24:35.540 --> 24:38.643
-Whoo!
-$1,600 for milk and macaroni.

24:41.046 --> 24:44.649
Next item up for auction
is handmade by Chef Richard Blais.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.152
-Talk to me.
-Truffle aioli.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.654
-Ooh!
-A binder, it brings everything together.

24:49.721 --> 24:52.691
Truffle, steak, chef's kiss.

24:52.757 --> 24:54.292
-Do I have $1,200?

24:54.359 --> 24:55.627
-Do I have $1,500?

24:55.694 --> 24:56.795
$1,500 going to Beth.

24:57.362 --> 24:58.663
$1,500 going once,

24:58.730 --> 25:01.466
uh, $1,500 going twice…

25:01.533 --> 25:05.370
Sold! Beth, $1,500 for some truffle aioli.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.572
Look at you, Miss Spend Box. Big spender!

25:07.639 --> 25:09.074
Thank you, Chef Blais.

25:10.942 --> 25:13.979
The final item up for auction
is very special.

25:14.045 --> 25:16.214
-So I'm going to keep it closed for now.
-Oh.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.517
What I can tell you is that the winner

25:18.583 --> 25:21.686
gets to choose a game-changing ingredient
for their final dish.

25:21.753 --> 25:24.523
My intuition is telling me
there is eggs in there,

25:24.589 --> 25:25.757
and I'm going for it.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.226
I don't care how much money I spend today.

25:28.293 --> 25:29.427
Let's do this!

25:29.494 --> 25:31.730
I'm ready for some more ingredients.

25:31.796 --> 25:35.133
I have $13,900 left.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.203
I'm like, "Come on,
let's see what we got. Let's go."

25:38.270 --> 25:40.372
Bidding starts $800.

25:40.438 --> 25:41.439
-$800.

25:41.506 --> 25:42.774
-$1,000.

25:42.841 --> 25:43.942
-$1,200.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.677
Going to Stephaughn. Do I hear $1,500?

25:45.744 --> 25:47.445
-$1,500 going to Beth.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.848
-$1,800 going to Stephaughn.

25:49.915 --> 25:51.516
-$2,000 going to Beth.

25:51.583 --> 25:55.086
$2,000 going once, $2,000 going twice…

25:55.153 --> 25:57.756
-Sold to Beth!
-Okay, what is it?

25:58.590 --> 26:01.459
It's a jukebox with a menu
of four ingredients.

26:01.526 --> 26:04.262
Let me know which one you want,
and Chef Blais will send it right out.

26:04.329 --> 26:07.465
"Country ham, onion, bacon, eggs."

26:07.532 --> 26:08.500
I'll take eggs.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.103
Oh, my gosh, I got my eggs.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.238
Game-changer.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.074
So I'm gonna do a high-end riff
on steak and eggs.

26:16.141 --> 26:18.877
The hardest thing is
how to transform these ingredients

26:18.944 --> 26:24.783
so it's still in the American diner vibe,
but it's not just steak on a plate.

26:25.283 --> 26:27.552
We gotta think,
we gotta think, we gotta think…

26:27.619 --> 26:31.222
I'm looking down at the gem lettuce going,
"You need to be part of this party."

26:31.289 --> 26:34.092
So I decide
I'm going to grill this gem lettuce,

26:34.159 --> 26:35.961
and it's going to be delicious.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.629
Let's get whisking.

26:37.696 --> 26:41.499
I'm taking the aioli, the beef consommé,

26:41.566 --> 26:46.638
mixing that up to get
a nice, vinaigretty, saucy vibe going.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.407
I would be stoked
to get this in a restaurant.

26:50.375 --> 26:54.012
I got some cheese curds
to make my mac and cheese sauce.

26:54.079 --> 26:58.149
I have something for my dish!
Mac and milk to the rescue.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.884
To top off my mac and cheese,

26:59.951 --> 27:03.388
I'm giving it a little texture
with some bread crumbs.

27:03.455 --> 27:07.592
I want this mac and cheese
to be crumbly, crispy, cheesy, and gooey.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.327
I need this to be really cheesy.

27:09.394 --> 27:12.163
Now I am a lot more confident in my dish.

27:15.200 --> 27:17.569
Ay, ay, ay,
that does not look great.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.973
I didn't get the milk from that auction,
which I needed for my soup.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.642
Ooh-hoo!

27:23.708 --> 27:26.511
Ding, ding, ding!
I know what I'm doing with this soup now.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.913
Just came to me!

27:28.980 --> 27:30.548
I'm taking that processed cheddar,

27:30.615 --> 27:33.385
and I'm going to put it
into my broccoli soup,

27:33.451 --> 27:35.654
and that's going to give it
that creaminess.

27:35.720 --> 27:39.190
Cheddar-broccoli soup, it's classic.
I think it may save my dish.

27:39.257 --> 27:41.226
I'm winning. I'm winning.

27:46.197 --> 27:48.400
-Last-minute auction?
-Oh, no.

27:48.466 --> 27:51.770
Home cooks, this is the final round.
Everything on the line here.

27:51.836 --> 27:55.440
We have beefsteak tomatoes.

27:56.107 --> 27:59.678
When I see those beautiful red tomatoes,
I know I need those for my sandwich,

27:59.744 --> 28:01.579
so I'm not afraid to spend a little money.

28:01.646 --> 28:03.014
Starting bid $500.

28:03.081 --> 28:04.215
-Do I have $500--

28:04.282 --> 28:06.051
-Going to Sue. Do I have $1,000?

28:06.117 --> 28:07.652
$1,000 going to Stephaughn.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.955
I think these tomatoes can add
a little something to my sandwich.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.590
-$1,500 going to Sue.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.994
But am I just bidding on these tomatoes
to raise the price?

28:16.061 --> 28:17.595
Me?

28:17.662 --> 28:18.563
Maybe.

28:19.064 --> 28:19.931
Do I hear 25?

28:20.498 --> 28:22.133
-$2,500 going to Sue.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.802
-Stephaughn, $3,000.

28:23.868 --> 28:27.772
Stephaughn, you need to stop
because I'm getting those tomatoes.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.374
-$3,500, Sue.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.043
You're making her spend, Stephaughn.
I love it.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.447
All right, 35 going once,
$3,500 going twice…

28:36.414 --> 28:39.751
Sold to Sue for $3,500.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.123
Home cooks,
you have less than five minutes left.

28:46.091 --> 28:49.060
Turkey. Ooh, okay, this is not very hot.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.263
I'm grilling my turkey for my turkey club,

28:52.330 --> 28:55.166
and it's just not cooking
the way I would like it to cook.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.135
It's cooking unevenly.

28:57.202 --> 29:00.538
Cook, baby. Cook.
Some of them cook, and some of them don't.

29:00.605 --> 29:02.607
I'm worried my turkey will be too dry.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.544
Not feeling
super confident with my beef liver,

29:06.611 --> 29:09.681
but I-- I never cook beef liver,
so it could be amazing.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.750
But I know my mac and cheese is bomb.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.986
My dish cost me…

29:15.053 --> 29:19.190
…an outrageous $11,500,

29:19.257 --> 29:20.992
but steak's cooked really good,

29:21.059 --> 29:24.262
and I think the aioli dressing
tastes great with it.

29:24.329 --> 29:25.463
So I feel really confident.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.300
I'm most nervous about the turkey.
That's my only thing.

29:29.367 --> 29:32.737
But looking at my sandwich
and seeing those tomatoes,

29:32.804 --> 29:34.572
I definitely made the right choice.

29:36.407 --> 29:40.345
Seven, six, five, four…

29:40.411 --> 29:43.381
-…three, two, one.

29:44.582 --> 29:45.517
Oh, man.

29:45.583 --> 29:47.685
-We did it, you guys. Whoo!
-We did it!

29:49.320 --> 29:50.588
All right, home cooks,

29:50.655 --> 29:53.391
we're sending these plates
back to Chef Blais for tasting.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.493
Oh, man.

29:57.028 --> 29:58.830
Whoo-ee! That was intense.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.632
-Okay. Intense for you?
-I'm really exc--

30:00.698 --> 30:03.134
-Yeah! Right? Just to watch.
-Right? Okay.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.537
-Wanna dive right in? Okay.
-Yeah, let's do it. Okay.

30:06.137 --> 30:08.239
Here, you have
a play on steak and eggs

30:08.306 --> 30:10.375
with a grilled sirloin steak,

30:10.441 --> 30:11.810
grilled baby gem lettuce,

30:11.876 --> 30:13.978
and a truffle aioli dressing.

30:15.180 --> 30:18.383
-This is the Spend Box, right?
-Mm-hmm. That's right. Yep.

30:18.449 --> 30:20.084
The prime cut strip steak,

30:20.151 --> 30:23.321
the egg, which was also something
that you had to spend on.

30:23.388 --> 30:25.590
-That was an upgrade, yep.
-With truffles on here.

30:25.657 --> 30:26.591
Another upgrade.

30:26.658 --> 30:29.794
-So this is like spend, spend, spend.
-Yes.

30:29.861 --> 30:32.197
-This is like a fine-dining chef salad.
-Mm-hmm.

30:34.966 --> 30:36.935
You know, the key with a salad
is you need to get

30:37.001 --> 30:38.803
that vinaigrette really dialed in.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.039
I'm not getting
enough acidity from the vinaigrette.

30:41.105 --> 30:41.940
Yeah.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.008
It's not missing seasoning,
which is great.

30:44.075 --> 30:46.878
And, I mean, listen,
when you order a steak at a diner,

30:46.945 --> 30:48.780
you want mid-rare,

30:48.847 --> 30:51.382
and they delivered.
The steak is cooked perfectly.

30:51.449 --> 30:52.584
Overall, it's a tasty dish.

30:54.152 --> 30:55.486
Chef, ready for the next one?

30:55.553 --> 30:56.521
-Yes.
-Okay.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.655
Here, you have

30:57.722 --> 31:01.860
an open-faced liver sandwich
with a breadcrumb mac and cheese.

31:01.926 --> 31:05.196
Okay. Uh, you need a deft hand
to cook beef liver.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.731
-Right?
-You do.

31:06.798 --> 31:09.434
It's definitely
sort of an old-school, vintage dish.

31:11.603 --> 31:13.805
The liver's quite tasty,
a little bit overcooked.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.341
I would have probably sliced it thin.

31:16.407 --> 31:18.576
-And it's a little bit one-note, right?
-Yeah.

31:18.643 --> 31:21.246
I'm looking for some acidity,
some sweetness to cut through

31:21.312 --> 31:25.350
the gaminess of the beef liver.
But let's get into this mac and cheese.

31:27.118 --> 31:29.854
-This was the Surprise Box.
-Yes.

31:29.921 --> 31:33.224
I mean, the surprise is
how delicious this mac and cheese is.

31:33.291 --> 31:35.126
-I guess this is the cheese curds.
-Yep.

31:35.193 --> 31:37.128
So you got
that nice sort of crumble in there,

31:37.195 --> 31:40.231
which adds this really, really nice
texture to this. It's super delicious.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.201
So, here you have

31:43.268 --> 31:45.136
a turkey club sandwich

31:45.203 --> 31:47.438
with cheese and broccoli soup,

31:47.505 --> 31:48.773
with a side of chips.

31:49.440 --> 31:53.344
One of my favorite things,
a classic turkey club.

31:53.411 --> 31:54.412
All right, look at this.

31:54.479 --> 31:57.081
I sent the tomatoes,
and they bought the tomatoes.

31:57.148 --> 31:58.316
-Yeah.
-Good call.

31:58.383 --> 32:00.785
It's gonna bring acidity to it,
sweetness, color.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.354
Guess how much
they bought the tomato for. $3,500.

32:03.421 --> 32:04.389
-Shut up!
-Yeah.

32:04.455 --> 32:05.790
-Shut up.
-Yeah, I swear.

32:05.857 --> 32:07.592
You gotta spend money
to make money sometimes.

32:07.659 --> 32:08.493
Tell me about it.

32:08.559 --> 32:10.395
-How much did that suit cost?
-Oh, I don't know.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.497
-We gotta ask Netflix. Hey, guys, uh…

32:12.563 --> 32:14.165
-Oh, my gosh.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.734
-All right, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna dip it.
-Dip it. Dip it.

32:16.801 --> 32:18.970
There it is. That's the play.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.777
The soup is seasoned really, really well.
And the sandwich,

32:25.843 --> 32:27.745
the tomato's amazing, pickles are sweet.

32:27.812 --> 32:31.749
Everything's coming together here,
but the turkey itself is pretty dry.

32:31.816 --> 32:34.552
But you know what I like about this?
It is a complete meal.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.088
If you went to a diner,
if you had a lunch,

32:37.155 --> 32:39.390
you got a three-course meal right there.
I like this.

32:41.059 --> 32:44.162
Okay, Chef, you've tasted
everyone's diner dishes.

32:44.228 --> 32:47.332
-Is there a winner amongst the group?
-Yeah, I think we got a winner.

32:50.935 --> 32:53.137
This is it. Time to give away some money!

32:53.805 --> 32:56.441
Home cooks, it's time to find out
who won the competition

32:56.507 --> 32:58.609
along with all the cash in their bank.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.079
But first, let me introduce you

33:01.145 --> 33:04.215
to our guest chef and judge,
Chef Richard Blais.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.689
How are we doing? What's up?

33:11.756 --> 33:13.725
First off, the food was tasty.

33:13.791 --> 33:17.729
I just want to commend you and applaud you
for the effort that you put forth.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.565
Okay, let's get to the results.

33:23.134 --> 33:26.404
Which home cook made the steak and eggs?

33:26.471 --> 33:27.372
That would be me.

33:27.438 --> 33:30.141
The steak was cooked
to a perfect medium-rare,

33:30.208 --> 33:33.811
but the salad, it did need
a little bit more acidity

33:33.878 --> 33:36.447
to turn that aioli into a proper dressing.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.383
Okay, so who made

33:38.449 --> 33:41.486
the open-faced liver sandwich
with mac and cheese?

33:41.552 --> 33:42.553
I did.

33:42.620 --> 33:45.423
When it comes to mac and cheese,
your mac and cheese delivered.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.426
The beef liver was cut
a little bit too thick

33:48.493 --> 33:49.694
and a little overcooked.

33:50.595 --> 33:52.030
Okay, so, Sue, you must have made

33:52.096 --> 33:53.798
the turkey club
with cheddar-broccoli soup.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.901
-Yes, I did.
-Classic turkey club was a great idea.

33:56.968 --> 34:00.638
And I love the flavor and the sides
in the composition of the dish.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.740
However, the turkey was overcooked.

34:04.275 --> 34:08.146
Sue, you have $12,300
remaining in your bank.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.416
And Beth, you have $9,000.

34:11.482 --> 34:12.383
Okay.

34:12.450 --> 34:18.022
And Stephaughn, you have
the largest amount remaining with $13,900.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.760
You all made great American diner dishes,

34:22.827 --> 34:25.363
but only one
was the true highlight of the menu.

34:26.864 --> 34:30.001
The home cook with the best diner dish is…

34:34.072 --> 34:35.940
-Beth.
-Oh, my God!

34:37.175 --> 34:38.876
-Are you serious?

34:39.477 --> 34:41.412
I feel amazing! I won!

34:41.479 --> 34:42.680
Wow!

34:42.747 --> 34:46.184
Congratulations, Beth, you won
all of that $9,000 left in your bank.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.185
Whoo!

34:47.251 --> 34:49.821
And proved you can cook at all costs.
Good job.

34:49.887 --> 34:51.923
-Yay! Thank you.

34:51.989 --> 34:56.461
I spent all my money in the auctions,
but I'm taking home $9,000!

34:57.261 --> 35:00.998
At this stage of my life, this is,
like, exactly what I needed to do,

35:01.065 --> 35:01.966
and I did it,

35:02.033 --> 35:04.635
and I feel really proud of myself
and really happy.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.738
This was
such an amazing experience.

35:07.805 --> 35:10.575
I'm definitely leaving here
as a better cook.

35:11.142 --> 35:15.179
Props to Beth and props to Sue.
We are forever friends now.

35:15.246 --> 35:17.782
If you at home are watching this
and are inspired,

35:17.849 --> 35:20.251
get in your kitchen,
cook some yummy food together,

35:20.318 --> 35:22.320
because it's a blast.
