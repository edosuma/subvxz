01:01.500 --> 01:04.300
<i>(# "Swan Lake" by Tchaikovsky
over PA)</i>

02:53.900 --> 02:56.100
- Who found them?
- He did.

02:57.300 --> 03:01.300
He was on patrol,
he left the path for a pee and...

03:01.400 --> 03:03.200
<i>(vehicle approaches)</i>

03:03.300 --> 03:05.900
- Uh-oh.
- Three lost souls.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.000
Like an execution, Pasha.
How long have they been here?

03:10.100 --> 03:11.800
Arkady.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.800
Greetings, comrades.
I bring you hot-water bottles.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.300
<i>(Arkady) Good. We were wondering
why you came, Comrade Major Pribluda. </i>

03:26.400 --> 03:31.100
This is a matter for militia. There's no
reason to think state security's involved.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.400
What interest is this to KGB?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.700
KGB decides what interests KGB.

03:38.800 --> 03:42.200
So, who are they?
What's it look like? Drunks, or what?

03:42.300 --> 03:47.300
If you want the case, Major, welcome.
We militia can go back to our beds.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.000
I wonder you ever left them.

04:00.400 --> 04:04.400
<i>(Arkady) Comrade Major,
you're disturbing the evidence. </i>

04:11.300 --> 04:13.500
Holy Mother.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.200
Look at this.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.300
Look.

04:25.400 --> 04:28.900
No face. Sliced right off.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.100
Good God.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.500
This one too. Butchered.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.800
Jesus.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.200
Faceless.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.400
All three of them.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.300
Who are they?

05:06.400 --> 05:10.100
- You've disturbed enough evidence.
- Oh, stop complaining.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.100
I've done some of the dirty work for you.

05:13.800 --> 05:17.400
Yes, I know. You always do, comrade.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.600
One day, Renko, this could be you.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.700
Let's leave these policemen to it.
The cold has made them inhospitable.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.900
Comrade Major?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.600
Are you sure you want
militia to investigate this?

05:39.600 --> 05:43.600
- What do you mean?
- It does seem like a KGB case after all.

05:43.600 --> 05:48.300
Bodies carved up in the middle of
Moscow. Who knows where it could lead?

05:57.200 --> 06:00.100
A body this size stays like stone for days.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.700
I'd say they'd been there
three weeks to a month.

06:02.800 --> 06:06.200
I'm about to make an incision
into the chest wall.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.400
- This is disturbing you?
- Well, I'm glad I had no breakfast.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.800
Sorry. I'm used to dealing with the dead.

06:14.900 --> 06:20.700
The only emotion I feel about one is
a faint hope it may be a party official.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.200
Be careful, my friend.
You don't want this case.

06:25.300 --> 06:28.200
Please. You don't want this case.

06:28.800 --> 06:32.600
How were they killed,
Comrade Chief Pathologist?

06:36.600 --> 06:39.800
The two men were shot in the head
at contact range.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.900
All three were shot in the chest.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.800
They were all in their twenties.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.600
Go on.

06:47.700 --> 06:52.700
Arkady, whoever cut off their faces knew
what he was doing. He was an expert.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.900
- And who are the experts, Levin?
- I'm not listening.

06:57.000 --> 07:01.400
They were there as soon as we were,
Pribluda and his gang. Who told them?

07:01.500 --> 07:05.000
You've got an informer
in your office, haven't you?

07:05.100 --> 07:07.500
Anything else for me?

07:07.600 --> 07:11.400
The smaller male dyed his hair.
Its natural color is red.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.400
Possible indication of antisocial activity.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.200
Or maybe he was a black marketeer.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.800
Or...

07:19.900 --> 07:23.400
- Or a foreigner.
- Arkady, please.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.000
I don't like to get
mixed up with KGB work.

07:26.100 --> 07:30.400
Don't worry. If one of these really is a
foreigner, it's out of our hands anyway.

07:30.500 --> 07:35.100
I've just got to find enough
to make KGB take over the case.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.500
And the quicker I can do that,
the safer we'll all feel.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.900
Chest incision!

08:06.200 --> 08:09.700
<i>(man) I can't understand it, lamskoy.
Dead bodies in Gorky Park. </i>

08:09.800 --> 08:14.000
<i>- What the hell are they doing there?
- (lamskoy) Yes, it passes belief, General. </i>

08:14.100 --> 08:16.800
Chief Investigator Renko
reporting, General.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.800
- Have you shaved this morning?
- Comrade General, I...

08:19.900 --> 08:24.800
- The general wants to know your initial...
- A fellow should keep hair off his face.

08:24.900 --> 08:29.000
Your initial reaction to this. What are
the prospects for an early resolution?

08:29.100 --> 08:32.900
With the world's finest militia
and the support of the Soviet peoples,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.900
I am confident we will apprehend the
criminals involved, Comrade General.

08:37.000 --> 08:41.299
Yes, yes, yes. I hope so, young man.
Your father, General Renko,

08:41.400 --> 08:45.900
he was always clean and tidy,
even when he was killing Germans.

08:46.500 --> 08:50.500
It's nearly four hours since the three
bodies were uncovered. Who are they?

08:50.600 --> 08:54.000
The bodies have no marks
of identification, Comrade Prosecutor.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.000
What? No papers? Here in Moscow?

08:57.100 --> 09:01.900
The bodies were badly mutilated.
No papers. No fingertips.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.800
No faces.

09:03.900 --> 09:07.200
They were clean-shaven,
General. Quite literally.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.400
Well...

09:11.400 --> 09:15.700
Your father was just as insolent,
but then he could afford to be.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.700
He was very good at his job, Renko.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.200
<i>(laughter)</i>

09:35.300 --> 09:39.100
<i>(man) Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. </i>

09:39.200 --> 09:42.000
For God's sake, Yuri,
can't you concentrate?

09:42.000 --> 09:44.900
Your button, man. Your tunic button.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
It's hanging off. Wardrobe!

09:48.800 --> 09:51.700
Irina! Irina, please.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.400
OK, let's set up again from the top.

09:55.400 --> 10:00.800
Remember, you're tired, you're
frightened, Napoleon has you on the run.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.600
Be careful, Misha.

10:03.600 --> 10:08.300
<i>- (man #2) Show me that barn door again.
- (man #1) Opening positions, everybody. </i>

10:08.400 --> 10:11.600
Quiet, please. Let's get ready to do this.

10:13.100 --> 10:15.400
Ready to roll.

10:18.900 --> 10:23.000
What does a chief investigator
want with me?

10:23.100 --> 10:26.500
We found your skates.
Your name was scratched on them.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.900
Oh, those. I lost them months ago.

10:30.000 --> 10:35.000
You reported them missing on February 4
but said you lost them on January 31.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.700
You didn't know
they were missing for four days?

10:37.800 --> 10:42.300
That's how it is. You don't
miss something till you need it.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.400
- They were found on a dead girl.
- There is justice after all.

10:48.900 --> 10:54.400
Please, don't be shocked. You've no idea
how long it took to save for those skates.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.000
Look at my boots. See?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.900
Split.

11:00.000 --> 11:04.000
She was murdered.
The girl wearing your skates.

11:04.100 --> 11:08.800
The director of that film promised me
new boots if I went to bed with him.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.600
Think I should?

11:11.700 --> 11:14.200
Winter is almost over.

11:14.700 --> 11:18.500
Exactly. And me a Siberian.
I am used to the cold.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.600
Is your heart cold too?

11:25.700 --> 11:26.800
What?

11:26.900 --> 11:30.800
The girl wearing your skates,
about your age.

11:30.900 --> 11:36.200
Two others were found with her,
also murdered. Their faces were cut off.

11:36.200 --> 11:39.800
What has this to do with me?
What do you want?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.600
Think back. Any idea
who took your skates?

11:44.200 --> 11:47.000
I suspect everyone.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.200
So do I.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.900
Well?

12:00.100 --> 12:03.100
Are you going to arrest me
for losing my skates?

12:04.500 --> 12:07.000
- Perhaps not.
- Good.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.900
Then please leave me alone.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.300
It's cold. We've been skating,

12:24.400 --> 12:28.400
but we've left the skating paths
for the clearing. Why?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.900
- To talk.
- To eat. It's why anyone goes skating.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.600
To stop, have a meat pie,
pass around the vodka.

12:33.700 --> 12:39.500
So I've brought food. There's vodka in
our bellies. We're feeling good, relaxed.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.500
Then...

12:42.600 --> 12:45.600
- You shoot from your pocket.
- Shoot your own foot that way.

12:45.600 --> 12:50.100
Forensic found traces of leather
in the bullet wounds.

12:50.200 --> 12:55.200
A bag. You brought the food
in a leather bag with the gun.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.400
We're friends.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.000
Enjoying ourselves.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.300
We leave the paths for a secluded place.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.000
We are all alone.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.100
I am handing out the food from the bag.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.500
<i>(gunshot)</i>

13:17.600 --> 13:21.700
And I don't suspect a thing
as you lift the bag close to my chest.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.800
What about the noise? Wouldn't the
other two call out? Wouldn't they run?

13:25.900 --> 13:29.900
- Well, they don't know what's happening.
- But the noise!

13:30.000 --> 13:31.800
Hey!

13:32.000 --> 13:33.800
Hey!

13:41.900 --> 13:44.100
The noise would make them run. It...

13:44.200 --> 13:47.000
<i>(# "1812 Overture" by Tchaikovsky
over PA)</i>

13:52.700 --> 13:55.700
What? What did you say?

13:55.800 --> 13:58.700
<i>(cannons fire in music)</i>

14:04.600 --> 14:08.400
<i>- (Pasha) You know what you just did?
- (Renko) We're missing something. </i>

14:08.500 --> 14:12.300
- Yes, you went through a red light.
- Concentrate. No fingertips, no face.

14:12.400 --> 14:17.300
Why? To make identification difficult. But
the killer shoots the two men in the head.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.100
- Why?
- And he risks making even more noise.

14:20.200 --> 14:25.900
Yes, but if he sliced off their faces, what's
the point of shooting them in the mouth?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.600
- What do you have in your mouth?
- My tongue.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.400
Your teeth.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.600
Your teeth!

14:41.300 --> 14:43.800
Gutta-percha.

14:43.900 --> 14:47.200
- He had root-canal work, the redhead.
- Meaning?

14:47.300 --> 14:52.100
Dentists in Europe don't use gutta-percha,
only the Americans.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.700
Finally, and overwhelmingly,

14:58.800 --> 15:03.500
the dental technique suggests
that the victim is an American.

15:04.700 --> 15:07.000
Arkady.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.200
Would you...?

15:12.300 --> 15:14.600
Excited, are we?

15:14.700 --> 15:17.600
I think we've got enough
to dump this case.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.400
I've just seen the report from Ballistics.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.700
- What weapon?
- It's a 7.65mm pistol.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.500
And that's a KGB gun.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.700
Is it that shithead Pribluda?

15:30.800 --> 15:34.800
That's like asking if a girl's a virgin when
I see her in bed with a man on top of her.

15:34.800 --> 15:37.000
Well, what man?

15:37.900 --> 15:40.100
<i>Oh! (laughs)</i>

15:43.900 --> 15:49.200
- Am I missing a joke?
- It's about your friend, Major Pribluda.

15:49.300 --> 15:52.600
What do you mean, "my friend"?

15:52.600 --> 15:55.400
What is it?

15:55.500 --> 15:58.000
I've been asked to lamskoy's dacha.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.200
He's throwing a weekend party
and he wants to talk to me.

16:01.200 --> 16:05.800
- That's a great honor, Comrade Renko.
- Well, well, well.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.600
You'll have to tidy yourself up.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.700
What?

16:13.300 --> 16:15.300
Oh, yes.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.300
Well, well. A weekend at the lamskoys'.

16:50.400 --> 16:54.900
Now, is it because your father
was a hero of the Soviet army? No.

16:55.000 --> 16:58.500
God knows, it can hardly be
because of your charm or elegance.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.800
Not all weekend, Anton. Just today,
long enough to get our host into a corner.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.000
So... what are you up to?

17:05.099 --> 17:07.599
- I'm saving a life.
- Whose?

17:07.700 --> 17:11.599
Mine. I'm on a case that reeks of KGB
involvement and I've got to be extra...

17:11.700 --> 17:14.400
Wouldn't you two
rather have good Soviet vodka?

17:14.500 --> 17:17.300
No, Natasha, wicked French wine will do.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.500
Who is that?

17:25.099 --> 17:28.500
<i>(Anton) That is Jack Osborne.
An American. </i>

17:28.600 --> 17:31.100
<i>(Natasha) He comes here
to buy our sable pelts. </i>

17:31.200 --> 17:34.100
Well, it is the only place
you can get them.

17:36.500 --> 17:40.800
They say the Kremlin uses him to take
messages to and from Washington.

17:40.900 --> 17:43.000
He's a very big wheel.

17:43.100 --> 17:46.300
<i>(Natasha) He even had dinner
with Brezhnev before he died. </i>

17:46.400 --> 17:51.800
<i>(Anton) Well, perhaps the conversation
would have been better after he'd died. </i>

17:51.800 --> 17:54.500
<i>(Natasha) Anton. </i>

18:06.400 --> 18:11.000
<i>(American man) The Ancient Greeks
understood the mechanics of power. </i>

18:11.100 --> 18:16.300
"Justice" they said. "Justice is
in the interests of the strong. "

18:16.400 --> 18:21.200
I've heard the same sentiment expressed
in not-too-dissimilar terms in America.

18:21.200 --> 18:25.200
"Those were the gold-maker rules"
someone said.

18:25.700 --> 18:30.100
<i>(lamskoy) You mean in America only
those with money can be innocent?</i>

18:30.200 --> 18:35.400
No. I mean in America, attorneys
do very well for themselves.

18:36.100 --> 18:40.800
Well, do you know what you're doing here
when you engage a defense lawyer?

18:40.900 --> 18:43.200
Wasting money.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.300
<i>(laughter)</i>

18:58.400 --> 19:01.200
I read your report, Arkady.

19:01.300 --> 19:06.200
And I can see that you are anxious
for the KGB to take over the case.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.300
But this is not like you, huh?
Why? What's wrong?

19:10.400 --> 19:14.000
- May I speak freely?
- To me? Always.

19:14.100 --> 19:19.100
It is more than possible
that KGB killed those three people.

19:25.500 --> 19:27.600
I agree.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.200
Then it is likely they are
laying a trap for me.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.400
Why?

19:32.500 --> 19:36.000
Once I tried to arrest Major Pribluda.
I proved he was an assassin.

19:36.100 --> 19:40.500
- Remember the two bodies by the river?
- God, it's cold out here.

19:40.600 --> 19:45.800
- You want to freeze my blood even more?
- I proved KGB did it.

19:45.900 --> 19:51.200
I moved for the indictment,
and I was arrested and beaten senseless.

19:51.200 --> 19:53.000
And who got you out?

19:53.100 --> 19:57.300
I was grateful to you. I am grateful to you.
But it's a poisonous farce.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.000
Arkady, things are changing.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.000
Believe me, I have more power
than used to be the case.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.800
They are more vulnerable.

20:05.800 --> 20:09.300
You're easily
the best policeman in Moscow.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.100
And I need your help. I need it badly.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.400
And you can protect me and my men?

20:18.600 --> 20:22.600
Listen, our Soviet constitution
is a noble piece of work.

20:23.600 --> 20:27.400
But only if honorable men
and women respect it.

20:27.500 --> 20:30.400
Now, I'm determined to stand on legality.

20:30.500 --> 20:36.500
KGB must not, cannot work outside the
law, or they're little better than the CIA.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.900
- But how?
- Support me. Don't try to unload the case.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.700
We mustn't give them a centimeter.
And I promise you, Arkady...

20:44.800 --> 20:48.400
I promise you, I'll be behind you
every step of the way.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

20:51.400 --> 20:53.100
<i>(lamskoy) Yes, my dear?</i>

20:53.200 --> 20:56.500
You are the only one here
who is going back to Moscow tonight.

20:56.600 --> 20:59.400
- It seems so.
- Will you take me with you?

20:59.400 --> 21:03.000
- At this hour? Is there something wrong?
- Please?

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
You'd better first persuade Mr. Osborne
to give you a fur coat, my dear.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.100
The investigator's car has no heater.

21:24.200 --> 21:29.400
Not the sort of place a girl without a
decent pair of boots normally goes, is it?

21:29.400 --> 21:32.800
Won't your rich American friend
be disappointed?

21:33.700 --> 21:36.100
I asked you for a lift, not a conversation.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.400
What, still upset
about a pair of lost skates?

21:39.500 --> 21:43.200
- If they were lost.
- I reported them missing.

21:43.300 --> 21:44.900
- Yes, but why?
- What?

21:45.000 --> 21:50.700
You're not the sort who goes to the police
for a thing like that without a reason.

21:52.500 --> 21:56.700
Were you afraid they might
turn up on the wrong person?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
- Let me out.
- What?

21:59.800 --> 22:05.400
- Stop and let me out. I'd rather walk.
- Don't be silly. You'd freeze to death.

22:06.000 --> 22:11.400
What are you doing? You're insane!
What are you trying to do? Kill yourself?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.800
Questions, questions.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.500
<i>(starter motor chugs)</i>

22:15.600 --> 22:19.600
Oh, no. Fine, fine.
Now we can both freeze.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.800
<i>(starter motor chugs)</i>

22:21.900 --> 22:23.700
Come on.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.900
<i>(engine starts)</i>

22:39.300 --> 22:41.900
KGB have better cars, you know.

22:42.000 --> 22:45.900
But they don't always take you
where you want to go, do they?

23:38.100 --> 23:40.800
<i>(# "1812 Overture" by Tchaikovsky

23:49.800 --> 23:51.600
<i>(gunshot)</i>

23:59.300 --> 24:03.000
I don't know whether to get deep
in this case or not. Really take it on.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.400
- Don't piss into the wind.
- Maybe. Maybe not. Forensic?

24:06.500 --> 24:11.000
Forensic picked up traces of gesso,
sawdust and gold on the clothing.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.500
- Gold?
- All used in the restoring of icons.

24:13.600 --> 24:18.600
Black marketeers. That's why the KGB
disposed of them. Sodding Pribluda.

24:18.700 --> 24:21.600
Anything else?
Did Forensic turn up anything else?

24:21.700 --> 24:24.700
Yeah, some spots
of chicken and fish blood.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.400
That's odd, isn't it?

24:27.500 --> 24:30.000
That doesn't fit.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.900
God, I wish we knew
what they looked like.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.500
Hm.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.800
<i>- No dessert?
- (snorts)</i>

24:49.500 --> 24:52.900
- And the redhead. I want his head too.
- Why not the other one?

24:53.000 --> 24:57.100
We know nothing about him. Besides,
how many do you think I can carry?

24:57.200 --> 25:00.900
So long as you know what to say
if they stop you in the street.

25:02.900 --> 25:06.000
<i>(man) The greatest of killers. </i>

25:06.100 --> 25:07.900
I'm sorry?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.100
Tamerlane the Great.

25:10.200 --> 25:14.100
Nasty man. His skull
showed right-side paralysis,

25:14.200 --> 25:16.600
and I had some hair to deal with.

25:16.700 --> 25:19.400
Yes, I see.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.500
Do you? Do you?

25:22.600 --> 25:23.900
Well...

25:24.000 --> 25:26.300
What about the mildew?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.300
On the upper lip?

25:32.400 --> 25:36.400
- Yes. I'm sorry, what do you mean?
- Where the moustache grew. Mildew.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.400
Of course.

25:39.400 --> 25:43.300
- I am Professor Andreev.
- Chief Investigator Renko. I tried to ring...

25:43.400 --> 25:48.900
I do not do forensic work,
either for militia or KGB.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.500
Renko?

25:53.600 --> 25:55.800
- How interesting.
- Why?

25:55.800 --> 26:00.000
Your father was General Renko.
You don't look a bit like him.

26:00.100 --> 26:05.500
My God. Your zygomaticus has a
completely different elasticity altogether.

26:06.500 --> 26:11.300
Promise me I can have your face
when the breath has left your body.

26:12.800 --> 26:17.200
Professor Andreev,
these heads have no faces.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.600
- Don't try to interest me.
- A murderer erased their identities.

26:29.700 --> 26:32.600
You can give it back to them.

26:49.100 --> 26:54.800
Professor, too many people
in our society disappear without trace.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.600
<i>(Andreev) Oh?</i>

26:56.700 --> 26:58.600
Why is that?

26:58.600 --> 27:00.800
They fall into a chasm.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.100
What sort of chasm?

27:04.200 --> 27:07.100
The one between what is said
and what is done.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.100
You may not be long for this world,
my fine, imprudent fellow.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.500
Hm.

27:30.600 --> 27:34.400
Right. First thing:
clean off the rest of the flesh. Hm?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.400

Who did it? What happened?

31:41.500 --> 31:43.600
Was it Pribluda? Arkady?

31:43.700 --> 31:45.900
No, no.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.200
I think it was an American.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.300
Christ.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.900
CIA, you think?

31:53.400 --> 31:56.200
Somebody with fists made of stone.

31:58.600 --> 32:01.000
- More painkiller?
- Mmmm.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.500
What are we doing in the kitchen?
You should lie down.

32:09.600 --> 32:12.900
This is where you keep
your French brandy.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.200
The way to do this is to imagine

32:23.300 --> 32:26.100
they are your loved one...

32:27.400 --> 32:30.000
these little creatures.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.100
Oh, yes, we need them.

- Be still.

So that's why...

Come, come. No man

Don't worry, I'm going home to bed.
This is my breakfast.

42:52.900 --> 42:58.100

his axe, and even you must learn to relax.

43:01.000 --> 43:03.900
Well, bed. I can relax in bed.

I have just the thing to open up
your pores and unclog your weary mind.

43:08.400 --> 43:13.600
This is my daily regime. A brisk walk,
a leisurely dip. It's wonderful.

43:46.600 --> 43:52.100
Even we humble servants of the state
need to be refreshed from time to time.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.600
Ah!

43:54.700 --> 43:57.200
Well, well. This is a surprise.

43:57.300 --> 44:00.600
You recall Chief Investigator Renko
from last weekend?

44:00.700 --> 44:06.600
Yes. I'm not sure whether he arrested or
abducted the lady who accompanied me.

44:06.600 --> 44:08.000
Rescued.

44:08.100 --> 44:10.700
Say, from the machinations of a capitalist.

44:10.800 --> 44:14.200
Do sit down, Jack. Have a drink.
Have something to eat.

44:14.200 --> 44:20.200
Talk to the only one of our homicide team
with a 100% record of success.

44:21.400 --> 44:26.400
I'm afraid I have an appointment
with a general so old that he dribbles.

44:39.900 --> 44:44.400
I always wanted to meet an American.

44:44.900 --> 44:47.500
You are so... so different.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.900
Forgive me for staring.

44:50.000 --> 44:55.100
Only once before did I ever meet
an American in the flesh, so to speak.

44:55.200 --> 44:58.200
A young student.
Kirwill, I think he was called.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.300
James Kirwill.

45:00.400 --> 45:02.600
Oh?

45:02.700 --> 45:04.700
But he was dead.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.100
That doesn't count, then, does it?

45:09.000 --> 45:13.400
You must have noticed many differences
between a man like yourself, Mr. Osborne,

45:13.500 --> 45:15.900
and a man like me.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.300
Man overboard.

45:20.200 --> 45:21.700
What?

45:21.800 --> 45:24.600
There's a sliver of food on your upper lip.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.600
I'm just a plodding investigator. No style.

45:32.600 --> 45:34.600
Completely out of my depth.

45:34.700 --> 45:41.200
Three bodies, three people,
shot down and mutilated in Gorky Park.

45:41.200 --> 45:44.500
And me, I have food on my lip.

45:45.400 --> 45:48.000
Not even caviar at that.

45:49.200 --> 45:53.200
I somehow feel that the executioner,
whoever he may be,

45:54.900 --> 45:57.600
would have preferred somebody...

45:58.500 --> 46:02.400
a more, um... nimble opponent.

46:39.500 --> 46:43.300
- Ah. Finished eating, are we?
- Yes, thank you.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.400
I understand you import our
wonderful Soviet sable into America.

46:48.500 --> 46:51.200
You Soviets have
the world monopoly on sable.

46:51.300 --> 46:53.800
I always wanted a sable hat.

46:56.000 --> 47:01.300
A man of your status should possess one.
Must we see what we can do?

47:01.400 --> 47:04.600
We Russians know how
to wait for things. I'm very patient.

47:04.700 --> 47:08.900
I watch and I think and I wait.
It is my only virtue.

47:09.300 --> 47:14.900
But why wait? I'm always happy to
accommodate particular Soviet friends.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.700
Patience has its own rewards.

47:18.400 --> 47:21.700
<i>- Do you want the hat or not?
- (laughs)</i>

47:22.800 --> 47:27.400
Perhaps the chief investigator
has some other reward in mind?

47:28.100 --> 47:30.400
Yes.

47:33.700 --> 47:35.700
Perhaps.

47:37.100 --> 47:39.700
- You don't know?
- Not yet.

47:39.800 --> 47:44.300
First I have the hunch,
then I begin to assemble reasons.

47:44.400 --> 47:46.600
Then I...

47:46.700 --> 47:48.900
- And then you...?
- I pounce.

47:49.000 --> 47:53.500
That's no way to catch a sable.
They're far too cunning and far too fast.

47:53.900 --> 47:58.300
While you wait and you think,
and you watch...

47:59.400 --> 48:01.600
your prey is gone.

48:01.700 --> 48:04.300
Oh, I don't think so.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.600
Good. Good.

48:07.700 --> 48:11.100
Meanwhile I have the hat and you don't.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.100
IRINA

48:39.200 --> 48:41.600
OSBORNE

48:56.100 --> 48:58.100
<i>(creak)</i>

49:13.400 --> 49:15.900
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

49:21.500 --> 49:24.500
<i>Bang! (laughs)</i>

49:26.600 --> 49:31.000
- Detective Pavlovich, you're drunk!
- Not as drunk as Fet.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.800
Detective Fet!

49:33.900 --> 49:39.200
- I told you to follow him, not...
- Ah, ah, ah. Look what I've got.

49:39.300 --> 49:42.300
One of the KGB files.

49:42.400 --> 49:46.200
- How in God's name...?
- I stole it. From Fet.

49:46.300 --> 49:48.700
Fet! Little bastard.

49:49.600 --> 49:51.600
Pasha!

49:53.600 --> 49:56.600
Well, open it. No vomit on it, is there?

49:56.700 --> 49:59.700
You mean you got Fet so drunk that...?

50:01.500 --> 50:04.900
- They'll shoot me, won't they?
- Probably.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.700
I'll get shot.

50:13.200 --> 50:14.800
Fuck it.

50:14.900 --> 50:19.100
Pasha, this is Irina Asanova's file!

50:19.200 --> 50:21.500
Put the light out.

50:22.700 --> 50:26.500
"Expelled from Moscow University
for antisocial behavior

50:26.600 --> 50:29.200
and unwise associations,

50:29.300 --> 50:32.300
particularly with Siberian renegade...

50:33.700 --> 50:36.100
Valerya Davidova. "

50:41.200 --> 50:45.200
"KGB informant: Feodor Golodkin. "

50:46.200 --> 50:48.400
"Used-car salesman. "

51:18.800 --> 51:21.200
<i>(Renko) Where is Valerya?</i>

51:22.300 --> 51:26.500
<i>- What are you talking about?
- Where do you think she is?</i>

51:26.600 --> 51:28.500
Who?

51:29.800 --> 51:31.800
I've seen your file.

51:31.900 --> 51:36.600
You were friends with Valerya Davidova
and an American student, James Kirwill.

51:36.700 --> 51:41.900
The same file will tell you I was expelled
from university for writing on a wall.

51:43.100 --> 51:46.700
- Your friends are dead. Murdered.
- You're sick.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.900
I'll show you their bodies,
their clothes. Come and see.

51:50.000 --> 51:53.000
You're one of a leper organization.
I won't be infected.

51:53.000 --> 51:56.700
- They were found in Gorky Park.
- Why do you lie? Do...

51:56.800 --> 52:00.200
- Where are they, these friends of yours?
- Out!

52:04.300 --> 52:06.200
Out?

52:06.300 --> 52:09.000
Who do you think got them out?

52:09.100 --> 52:12.700
You're trying to trap me.
I'm not going to betray my friends.

52:12.800 --> 52:17.800
Whoever was to get them out led them to
their deaths. You must be in danger too.

52:17.800 --> 52:20.400
They're free.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.400
Free.

53:14.200 --> 53:17.800
Like a thigh, eh?
Just like strokin' her leg.

53:17.900 --> 53:20.100
Nice. Very nice.

53:23.400 --> 53:28.300
You're in love already.
Go on, take your time. Walk around it.

53:32.400 --> 53:35.900
If I wanted to walk,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

53:45.800 --> 53:50.000
- Anna said I was to talk to Golodkin.
- Who?

53:50.100 --> 53:54.600
Look, I've got these marks,
West German money. I was trying to...

53:54.700 --> 53:57.100
- That's all right. I can deal in that.
- No, no.

53:57.200 --> 54:01.200
Gotta be Golodkin.
"Make sure it's Golodkin" she said.

54:06.700 --> 54:12.300
It's all right, friend. Meet Feodor,
Feodor Golodkin. I'm your man.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.300
You never said a truer word.

54:17.800 --> 54:20.200
<i>(Golodkin) Where the fuck
are you going?!</i>

54:20.300 --> 54:24.100
- This is militia headquarters, dickhead!
- Just shut it.

54:24.200 --> 54:27.100
<i>(Golodkin) I work for the KGB.
I'm not talking to you. </i>

54:27.200 --> 54:29.100
All right?

54:30.800 --> 54:32.700
Now, listen...

54:36.000 --> 54:38.900
Pasha... open the window.

54:40.300 --> 54:42.500
My pleasure.

54:42.600 --> 54:45.200
This is all some kind
of a misunderstanding.

54:45.300 --> 54:50.800
How did a greasy, parasitic pimp like you
come to meet a girl like Irina Asanova?

54:51.600 --> 54:53.000
Who?

54:53.100 --> 54:56.200
Pasha, handcuff this piece of shit.

54:56.300 --> 54:58.700
- Hey, now look. Hey, come on.
- My pleasure.

54:58.800 --> 55:03.200
Hey, now listen. Get off me.
Come on! I'm protected by KGB.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.300
- Ow! That hurts!
- Pasha, lift him up.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.600
- Get off me!
- Why are you trying to escape?

55:08.600 --> 55:10.800
I'm not! I'm not!

55:12.400 --> 55:13.800
What did he do, Pasha?

55:13.800 --> 55:18.000
Ran wildly to the open window,
Comrade Chief Investigator.

55:18.000 --> 55:22.600
- That's right.
- No, I didn't! I didn't! I didn't! I didn't!

55:24.100 --> 55:26.900
No! No-o-o-o!

55:27.000 --> 55:30.900
We were counting.
When we reached three, away he went.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.100
- You're crazy. You wouldn't.
- One.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.000
<i>- (both) Two.
- No!</i>

55:36.900 --> 55:39.300
- Three!
- No! Listen!

55:42.300 --> 55:48.500
That's him. He and Valerya and Irina and
this big fellow, Kostia, they were cronies.

55:48.600 --> 55:50.900
Kostia, did you say?

55:51.000 --> 55:55.700
- Who was he? What was he?
- He was a big ape from Siberia. Mukta.

55:55.800 --> 55:57.800
He was screwing Valerya.

55:57.900 --> 56:00.800
And they all knew Jack Osborne?

56:00.900 --> 56:03.500
Mr. Jack Osborne? Yeah.

56:04.500 --> 56:07.500
- He wanted to bed down the girl. Valerya.
- And did he?

56:07.600 --> 56:11.100
I should think so. Girls like
screwing foreigners, don't they?

56:11.200 --> 56:15.000
It's almost as good as travel.
Clean sheets, little presents.

56:17.600 --> 56:21.200
And Kostia didn't seem to mind.
He was after something else.

56:21.300 --> 56:25.100
You see, Kostia knew that
Mr. Jack Osborne wanted something.

56:25.200 --> 56:28.400
- That's...
- What did Osborne want?

56:28.500 --> 56:31.300
A chest. A big church chest.

56:31.400 --> 56:34.200
That's not a nun with tits.

56:37.100 --> 56:40.100
You know, with religious panels. Big...

56:40.200 --> 56:43.100
- What for?
- I don't know.

56:43.200 --> 56:47.000
But he promised me 2,000 American
dollars if I could get him one.

56:47.100 --> 56:49.500
- And did you?
- Yes, I did.

56:49.600 --> 56:52.200
But Mr. Jack Osborne
looked straight through me.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.800
He got one from those three.
Cheaper, I'll bet.

56:54.900 --> 56:58.700
- Kirwill, Valerya and Kostia?
- Yeah. And I can't sell the one I got.

56:58.800 --> 57:04.300
It's too big for anybody to smuggle out.
You can't chop up a chest and hide it in...

57:04.400 --> 57:07.000
Where is this chest?

57:07.000 --> 57:09.600
Where is it?

57:09.700 --> 57:11.700
My place.

57:11.800 --> 57:14.400
- Pasha, go with him. I want that chest.
- What, now?

57:14.500 --> 57:16.500
Yes, now.

57:32.800 --> 57:35.000
Goodbye, pretty lady.

57:48.400 --> 57:51.200
Well, I work hard. I work very hard.

57:52.600 --> 57:55.200
Holy Peter!

57:55.200 --> 57:58.200
Something you want?
Anything you'd like?

57:59.800 --> 58:01.700
Where's this chest?

58:02.500 --> 58:07.600
How about, um,
100 good French condoms?

58:07.700 --> 58:10.000
- All colors.
- 100?

58:10.100 --> 58:13.400
Mm. It's just about enough
for a weekend, eh?

58:13.500 --> 58:16.700
- The chest.
- It's in the bathroom.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.900
There's no room for it in there.

58:25.900 --> 58:29.900
I don't want the damn thing
clutterin' up my nice room, anyway.

59:16.500 --> 59:22.100
Comrade Prosecutor, Golodkin
was of some assistance to KGB.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.900
- You know how it is.
- An informer, you mean.

59:24.900 --> 59:29.700
<i>- Well, it is our case.
- What do you mean "your case"?</i>

59:30.600 --> 59:34.300
- You festering baboon.
- And we have already determined

59:34.400 --> 59:38.300
that Golodkin shot your man and
then turned his own gun upon himself.

59:38.400 --> 59:42.000
- Very swift deduction. Congratulations.
- Your man was unarmed.

59:42.100 --> 59:46.300
It was that file, wasn't it?
It was a trap. A trap!

59:46.400 --> 59:49.800
- I have no idea what you're talking about.
- Listen!

59:49.900 --> 59:54.100
<i>- You killed him! It was you!
- (lamskoy) Arkady! Arkady!</i>

59:54.200 --> 59:56.200
Pull yourself together.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.500
<i>(Renko) There is an American
who is a link to everything. </i>

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.200
<i>(lamskoy) Oh? Who?</i>

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.400
<i>(Renko) An American who knew
all three of them. </i>

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.500
An American who had
dealings with Golodkin.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.400
An American who has
very powerful friends.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:27.100
- KGB friends.
- Who?

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.900
An acquaintance of yours, I'm...

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:32.500
Osborne.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.100
Osborne? Jack Osborne?

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:40.900
Why would an American businessman kill
three nobodies in the middle of Moscow?

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
I don't know.

01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:45.800
- Unless...
- Unless what?

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:49.000
Unless they were all involved
in something so big

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:53.300
that Osborne had to make sure
his partners would never, ever talk.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.500
- Jack Osborne.
- Yes.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Are you sure? Quite sure?

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.600
In my bones.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.300
Well, then...

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.400
go after him.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.100
He's at the Metropole Hotel.

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.700
Rattle him.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:19.400
Trip him up.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.300
Where is Valerya? You have to tell me.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:13.800
Safe.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.500
Please. I must know.

01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:18.700
At this precise moment?

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.800
Certainly finishing her lunchtime
apéritif in Manhattan.

01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.700
Come to my room.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.100
Please.

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.700
<i>(Irina) Let me go!</i>

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:37.700
Go away. I'm KGB.

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.600
Why'd you come in
through the window, Boris?

01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:19.300
What?

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:22.100
The door was open.

01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:31.900
<i>- (Kirwill) Who is she?
- (Renko) Irina Asanova. </i>

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.900
She knew your brother and the other two.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000
We've got to get her temperature down
quicker. Get some ice from my fridge.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:42.900
- Was she in on the killings?
- She thinks they got out.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.500
She can't believe they're dead.
But she's the key.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.500
Jesus Christ! What the hell kind
of a diet are you on, anyway, pal?

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.600
Bring the ice.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:04.700
What the hell is that?

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.700
I had it reconstructed from
one of the Gorky Park heads.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:10.400
Why?

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.000
The killer had sliced off their faces.

01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:17.100
Shit.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.400
She'll be in a bad way when she comes
round, and if she sees that head...

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.900
I'll take it.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.300
She's going to be all right.
He didn't get enough into her veins.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:35.200
Renko, give me somethin'.

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:38.100
Give me somethin' to work on.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Come on.

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.300
I believe the three were making a chest.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.000
A religious chest for
the black market in icons.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:54.100
- Yeah. And?
- Their clothing.

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.300
Beside the traces of gold and gesso...

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:04.300
there were spots of chicken
and fish blood. I don't know why.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.700
I've been in Soviet markets. I've never
seen anything fresh enough to bleed.

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:13.500
- I'll be seeing you.
- I'm very grateful to you.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:20.000
Well, when you took that shot
at me you aimed away.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Not by much.

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.899
By enough. Maybe you're for real.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.899
Maybe you just don't shoot very well.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.700
You'll never know, will you?

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:24.300
Why did you save my life?

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:27.200
You're important to my investigation.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.700
- Now what?
- Well, when your clothes are dry, you go.

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.200
Where?

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.899
It's up to you.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.100
Home.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.000
They'll be waiting for me.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.500
Friends, then. You must have
someone you can stay with.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.300
And get them into trouble as well?

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:56.100
- Citizen Asanova...
- Irina.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.700
You've undressed me.

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.900
Irina.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.300
- This is the worst place for you to be.
- It's very simple.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:11.500
Either you are with them, and it doesn't
matter where I run, or you are not and...

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.400
<i>- You'll be trapped here. They saw me.
- We'd be trapped here. </i>

01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:17.900
I can't take care of you.

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:20.800
You've got two plates, two cups.

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:23.900
Why did you go to the hotel?

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.700
- What is Osborne to you?
- A friend.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.100
A friend? What sort of friend?

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.000
Is he the one you think
got them out? Is that it?

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.900
No questions.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.600
Irina.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.600
My friend is dead. Your friends are dead.

01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:48.300
- Why delude yourself? Why?
- Then why did KGB try to take me?

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:51.600
Perhaps to protect the killer.
To protect Osborne.

01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.100
All I know is your friends were killed.

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.400
- No!
- Irina, please.

01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.100
If I had a gun and I could
get out, I'd shoot you now.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.500
Here, take it.

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.600
Take it.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:12.000
What are you waiting for?

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:23.100
That's not going to get me out, is it?

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:43.700
How are they killed?

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:46.300
- Uh, who?
- Sables.

01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:50.400
- You don't think I kill them myself?
- Yes, I do.

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.200
Oh, no, no, no. I do not soil my hands.

01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:57.500
I mean, do you kill the animal when you
eat his flesh or use his skin for boots?

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.000
No. Like most of us I turn
my eyes from such things.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.300
- Exactly.
- I said like most of us.

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:07.600
Yes, I suppose there are those
who enjoy the act of butchery.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:12.900
Especially if they feel
themselves superior beings.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.100
- Yes?
- What are we talking about?

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.000
- Dead bodies in Gorky Park.
- Ah.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:23.100
- Doesn't it interest you?
- Me?

01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.100
I have established that
you knew all three of them.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.100
Have you, now?

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:29.500
Well.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.500
I met Stalin when I was young.
Did you know that?

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.300
No.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.900
Well, you do know that Stalin is dead.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:45.300
Now, does the mere fact that I met him
prove that I killed him?

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.700
- The sadist cut off their faces.
- Do you mind?

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:53.500
In the same way he might skin an animal.

01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:57.000
A sable, perhaps.

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:59.700
I don't think we'll be seeing
each other again.

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:01.100
Oh?

01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:06.300
You once said that patience
was your only virtue.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:10.300
That you watch and you wait.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.200
I have only four days more in Moscow.
After that I'm leaving for good.

01:14:15.300 --> 01:14:18.400
However, I feel that you
deserve some reward.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:23.000
Expect a knock at your door.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.500
I'm having that sable hat delivered to you.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.300
- It was good. Thank you.
- Anybody can cook stew.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.400
You could burn it. I do.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.800
Irina?

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:55.900
Help me, please.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.800
How do I know the attack on me
wasn't staged to make me trust you?

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.500
Irina.

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:19.100
How do I know that you didn't plan it
to make me betray my friends?

01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.300
Like Osborne, you mean.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
Your friend Osborne.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:30.500
Let's talk about Osborne.
Tell me about Osborne.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.400
Is that all you can do? Talk?

01:15:34.100 --> 01:15:35.800
Talk?

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.300
Irina, listen.

01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:43.700
You don't have to talk so much.

01:15:44.600 --> 01:15:47.400
Irina, I am your friend.

01:15:53.100 --> 01:15:55.400
No. My enemy.

01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:06.200
Everything I've told you... is either
an extraordinarily elaborate lie...

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.900
or the very simple truth.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.900
It's a lie.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.900
No! No!

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:47.300
They're not dead. They're not dead.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:50.200
Don't hold back. Let it out. Let it come.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.700
I'm...

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.300
Arkady, I'm going out of my mind.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.900
I don't know what's going on or who to...

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.700
Irina, listen to me. I won't tell you lies.

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:12.200
- No, you're tormenting me.
- No. No, Irina.

01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.700
It doesn't matter how ridiculous a lie is
if it's your only chance of escape.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.700
No. Irina, no.

01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:36.000
It doesn't matter how obvious the truth is
if the truth is that you'll never escape.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.700
Irina.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.300
<i>(Kirwill) So this Irina was
a friend of my brother. </i>

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:26.200
At the university before he was deported.

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.500
Why did he come back?

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:34.100
Jimmy wanted to be a fuckin' hero.
You gotta turn right, right here.

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:38.300
He was determined to smuggle somebody
out of the Soviet Union.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.100
Anybody, even if they didn't wanna go.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.400
How come you know so much about us?

01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:47.600
My grandmother. She was one
of you. She was a Russian.

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.700
I spoke Russian before I spoke English.

01:19:50.800 --> 01:19:54.100
Jimmy was... He was always
obsessed with this country.

01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:56.600
It's all he ever talked about.

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:00.000
All right. You gotta turn left
in here and then park.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:04.300
<i>- (Kirwill) Heard of born-again Christians?
- No. </i>

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:09.200
Born-again Christians. They don't smoke,
they don't swear, they don't fuck.

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.900
All they do is talk about Jesus
and try to walk on the goddamn water.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:18.200
That was Jimmy, God love him.

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:26.000
- That's it over there.
- How'd you find this place?

01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:30.800
I got a nose for fresh fish
and chicken blood.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:34.400
What a stench.

01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:37.900
This is where they made the chest.
That's how they got 'em out.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.600
- Live sables.
- Bingo. They fed 'em the fresh meat.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.600
Six live sables.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.300
I'm no expert on sable shit
but, yeah, I think so.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:50.000
They'd be worth how much
to an American?

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:54.400
Freedom. Smash the monopoly. How
high can you count? Worth killing for.

01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:57.000
Motive.

01:20:57.100 --> 01:20:59.400
Evidence.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.500
Circumstantial.

01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:05.900
Witness.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.700
In your apartment, Arkady.

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:12.800
She's got to tell me, now.
Osborne is leaving in three days.

01:21:16.300 --> 01:21:18.500
Don't kill him.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.400
Not yet.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.400
What is it, Arkasha?

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:36.900
I have no sugar for your tea.

01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:39.500
I don't need it.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.600
Do you still think I'm lying to you?

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.200
- That I am just a militia investigator?
- Arkasha...

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:54.400
Do you imagine I'm trying to trap you,
that this is all just a terrible game?

01:21:54.500 --> 01:21:56.300
No.

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:01.100
But...

01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:03.200
But what?

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.900
- If Valerya is safe somewhere...
- Irina, I love you.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.200
I... Arkasha...

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.800
Help me.

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.500
I've learned to trust nothing.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.600
Nobody.

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:23.000
Never.

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.700
Irina.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.500
If Valerya is safe somewhere, I...

01:22:30.100 --> 01:22:33.900
And if she is dead, she is dead.
How can I help her?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.800
- Let's go.
- Arkady.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.400
You talk too easily about dying.

01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:06.200
Where are we going, Arkasha?

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:08.400
You'll see.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:45.100
You know who was here, don't you?

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.100
Come on!

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:48.600
No.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.800
Then what else can I do?

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.500
Little Jimmy.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:13.900
Kostia, the big man.

01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:19.700
Valerya, you. Let us reconstruct.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.900
- Please. Arkady, don't.
- There's three of you.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:27.500
You believe a whole new life
is about to begin. Yes. Glide.

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.300
<i>Glide. Valerya and Kostia and Jimmy. </i>

01:24:31.700 --> 01:24:34.300
<i>Let your skates bite and hiss. </i>

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.000
<i>Your very movement reminds you of the
freedom that will soon be yours. Glide. </i>

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:43.300
Glide, my little ones.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.400
Ah, Valerya.

01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:50.300
The little bird. She's wearing her
friend's skates. Her good friend.

01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:53.500
But there's someone else watching.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:59.000
Isn't there? Someone who
beckons them from the ice.

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:03.100
Oh, happy Valerya. Trusting
Valerya. Innocent Valerya.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.200
I'm their savior from the West.
It's laughter and toasts.

01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.400
Hear the music?

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:13.300
Ah, we need another bottle.
Why not? I sort through the bag.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.500
I feel the grip of the gun.

01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:22.300
I turn to Kostia and I smile.

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:24.800
And...

01:25:29.500 --> 01:25:32.400
<i>Jimmy doesn't know what's
happening. How can this be? </i>

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.700
Osborne had used him to gull the others.
He had been brought back into Russia

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.900
as proof that Osborne could get
people in and out. Isn't that so?

01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:45.500
Poor Jimmy. Idealistic Jimmy
who only wanted to help.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.100
The Christian who now
must turn the other cheek.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:00.700
- What about Valerya?
- No, Arkady.

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:03.700
- No.
- My love, why don't you stop me?

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:07.000
Do I have to be the killer?
I have to have a witness.

01:26:07.100 --> 01:26:10.500
Someone must tell me.

01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:16.100
You must tell me.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:18.200
I can't.

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.600
She doesn't scream. Doesn't run.

01:26:24.700 --> 01:26:26.700
What's the point?

01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:30.000
Her life, her hopes... done.

01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:35.700
This man has made love to her. He can
bring the gun as close as he wants.

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.700
He can almost caress her with it
and she'll welcome the bullet.

01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:47.900
No.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.500
Yes.

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.100
<i>(gunshot)</i>

01:27:03.100 --> 01:27:05.100
<i>But what of Valerya's friend? </i>

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:10.300
What about you? She won't tell because
she wants Valerya to be in America, free.

01:27:10.300 --> 01:27:16.500
She won't tell because Osborne has
told her she is to be the next to get out,

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:21.700
and this fantasy is the most
important thing in her life.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.300
It's all that keeps her going.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.200
Yes.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.400
So, the question is, where is Valerya?

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:39.500
New York.

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:43.000
She's in New York.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.900
But in Moscow...

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.600
the great Professor Andreev...

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:04.900
can reconstruct a head.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.200
A face.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.100
From the bones and tissue alone.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.900
No. Hope is all I know.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
Here is Valerya.

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.400
V- Valerya. Valerya. Valerya!

01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.300
- Valerya who?
- Valerya Davidova.

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:29.700
- The others?
- Kostia Borodin. James Kirwill.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.700
- What were they doing here?
- Making a chest for Osborne.

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.900
American furrier, Jack Osborne?

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000
Yes, Jack Osborne.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:41.400
You saw what they brought
Osborne here from Siberia.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:43.900
Tell me. Say it.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:45.400
Sables.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:48.300
Live, dead, pelts, what?

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.300
- Live sables.
- How many?

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.100
Six sables.

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:56.500
Six live sables.

01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600
Good girl.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.400
I hate you.

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.100
Irina, lies are not freedom.

01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:12.400
I hate you!

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600
Where'd she go?

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:54.500
Think she's taken off with Osborne, huh?

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.700
OK. Well, tell me where
we're going, will you?

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:04.200
I need the other head.
Then I'll have enough.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:06.900
The other head?

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.900
<i>- (Kirwill) KGB?
- (Renko) Yes. </i>

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.800
But why would they steal the evidence?
It must be something else.

01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:35.900
- What else?
- Well...

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.600
We'll see, won't we?

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:39.700
What the hell are you doin'?

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.500
You know where we are.

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.200
Now I do.

01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:58.300
I'm a fool.

01:31:59.100 --> 01:32:02.400
- What does that mean?
- That I've missed everything.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:06.000
That's lamskoy, the chief
prosecutor of Moscow.

01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:10.300
And Jack Osborne. They've
been dealing the whole time.

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:16.300
So now they'll deal with me.
I've no chance now, nowhere to go.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.200
They've beaten me.

01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.600
Oh, God.

01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:24.800
Don't look.

01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:15.900
<i>- (lamskoy) You'll be even richer.
- (Osborne) You won't be exactly poor. </i>

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.800
<i>(lamskoy) What can I spend it on here?
I wish I could come to Stockholm. </i>

01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:23.300
Diamonds look their best
on a young girl's throat.

01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:26.400
<i>(Osborne) You must never
again be seen with me. </i>

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.300
But I'll send you a postcard
from Stockholm.

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:31.400
Good luck, then.

01:33:55.900 --> 01:33:57.900
<i>- Bastard.
- (Renko) Don't. </i>

01:33:58.900 --> 01:34:02.900
You're making a mistake. We're
on the same side. I promise you.

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:08.000
We wanna talk to him.

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:09.500
<i>(chokes)</i>

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.700
You're a fool!

01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:21.700
We don't need to talk to him.
Osborne's going to Stockholm.

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.900
Stockholm!

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.600
Come on! Get me out of this place.

01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:31.700
Come on! I wanna stay one step
ahead of that bastard.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.100
You on the outside and me on the inside,
looking at you from the morgue!

01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:15.900
I want you to promise me,
Anton, on your life...

01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:23.100
that you will take all this-papers, tape -
personally to the prosecutor general.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:26.100
On my life, I promise.

01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.100
- And give me your gun.
- Oh, Christ.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.300
It's a lawyer's special issue.

01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.100
It probably won't shoot straight.

01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:03.800
And if Irina ever turns up...
take care of her for me.

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:07.400
Well, sure. I'll give her your beautiful car.

01:36:20.200 --> 01:36:23.400
- What are you going to do?
- A brisk walk.

01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.000
And a little dip.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:54.200
Arkady.

01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:59.600
The firing squad will not be quite
as much fun as Stockholm, will it?

01:37:07.900 --> 01:37:10.300
Arkady.

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.900
You're out of... you're out of control.

01:37:18.100 --> 01:37:20.700
You kept me on the case
to put pressure on Osborne.

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:23.900
He couldn't have been offering... enough.

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:26.200
But you settled.

01:37:26.300 --> 01:37:28.800
The price must have been high.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:33.600
You should be looked after.
Certainly you should be looked after.

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:36.800
How much?

01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:41.100
$100,000, American?

01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:45.200
Come on. You know
the value of live sables.

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:48.500
This'll be worth tens
of millions to Osborne.

01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:51.500
Osborne was greedy.

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:54.500
That's why I had to
threaten him with, uh...

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.800
I was going to say my best man.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.400
150,000, hm? How about that?

01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.200
<i>- (gunshot)
- (lamskoy cries out)</i>

01:39:38.300 --> 01:39:40.600
<i>- (man) I've ordered stingers.
- (Pribluda) Stingers. </i>

01:39:40.700 --> 01:39:43.200
- What's that?
- Cognac and crème de menthe.

01:39:43.300 --> 01:39:46.600
Which of the two is meant
to spoil the other?

01:39:46.700 --> 01:39:49.900
<i>(man) In Sweden all
excesses are permitted. </i>

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:57.800
Comrade Pribluda, when do I get
the gun, and where do I kill him?

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:02.300
You will ask no questions.
You will make no comments.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:05.200
You will simply do as you're told.

01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.100
Consider yourself lucky to be still alive.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:14.200
Osborne will trade. He'll return the
six sables, but he'll only talk to you.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:17.200
And I don't like that, Renko.

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.500
I'm warning you. Be very, very careful.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.600
Why will he trade?

01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:27.000
What will he trade?

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:32.800
Which is the brandy?
Which is the crème de menthe?

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.900
Let's see if you can tell, Renko.

01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:44.600
<i>(Osborne) Bruised, are we?</i>

01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:49.200
I imagine they wanted to make quite sure
you were telling the truth about lamskoy.

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:52.700
Well, he didn't know
how good you were, did he?

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.700
The fool.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:58.600
And now you're here to kill me.

01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.800
Right?

01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.700
Yes.

01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.700
What do you think?

01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:47.700
You know the KGB will always
track you down, wherever you are.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:49.400
Precisely.

01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.300
So, what exactly are you proposing?

01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.900
- Do not be unduly alarmed.
- What are you doing?

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.000
You haven't seen
the rest of the house yet.

01:42:11.300 --> 01:42:14.900
Old houses are so like people,
don't you think?

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.400
Full of surprises.

01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:21.900
- Open that door.
- What?

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
Open the door.

01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:42.200
I made them bring you.

01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:45.200
You see, corruption is part of us.

01:42:45.300 --> 01:42:47.500
All of us.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.300
The very heart of us.

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.800
Irina?

01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:11.500
Why should a woman sleep with a killer
unless she likes being hurt?

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:13.100
- No!
- No?

01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:17.000
Then it's money that excites you,
perhaps? It's money?

01:43:17.100 --> 01:43:22.200
You've earned it, Irina. You paid with
the lives of your friends. What is this?

01:43:22.300 --> 01:43:25.100
Is this another one of his gifts?

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:28.500
You're a whore, Irina.

01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:31.600
You're a whore.

01:43:33.800 --> 01:43:39.800
When you showed me the head -
Valerya's head - I decided to kill myself.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.900
- Melodrama.
- Yes.

01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:46.700
I went to Osborne instead.
I slept with him.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.900
I didn't feel dirty. I felt as though
a layer of my skin had been burnt away.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:02.000
- I knew what to do.
- Yes. Sell yourself.

01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:06.000
What else did I have to sell?

01:44:15.500 --> 01:44:18.400
I told him I knew everything.

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:22.300
But I knew he wanted me. I told
you I'd do anything to get out.

01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.900
Anything.

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.300
The second day in Stockholm I went
to the KGB. The Russian embassy.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.400
I told them I could get the sables back
if they would trade you for them,

01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:35.700
if they would let you out because...

01:44:35.800 --> 01:44:37.800
because I...

01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:43.800
Irina?

01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.800
I had to get you out.

01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:52.300
It was the only reason.

01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:57.200
Why would Osborne trade
the sables for me?

01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:05.600
He's got more than six, Arkasha.

01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:09.000
Valerya and the others helped him
use the route once before.

01:45:09.100 --> 01:45:11.500
He's got another six sables.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.200
And nobody knows it, except him and me.

01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:19.800
And now you.

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:55.000
Frankly, I am astounded that your people
would understand a sexual obsession.

01:45:56.200 --> 01:46:01.100
But, well, it seems they understand that
I want her enough to trade the sables.

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.700
Only she won't come without you.

01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.700
But they sent me here to kill you.

01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:09.900
But they'd rather have
their little furry friends back.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:13.100
- But my job is to kill you.
- What?

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:16.000
Kill a man who keeps his promises?

01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:22.700
You see the hat that was not
delivered to you in Moscow.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.200
Barguzinsky sable. The finest.

01:46:25.300 --> 01:46:28.600
There's no more comparison
between this and ordinary fur

01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:32.100
than Irina's skin and that of other women.

01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:35.200
Feel it.

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:41.000
You're sick, Osborne. Sick. I don't want
the hat or anything else from you.

01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:45.100
Oh, be forgiving. You want
to survive, don't you?

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.200
Tomorrow, if you convince them,
the Soviets and I will trade.

01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:53.100
You and Irina for the six sables.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.200
Oh, and, uh, $200,000.

01:46:57.500 --> 01:46:59.500
Do you agree?

01:47:00.500 --> 01:47:02.000
Yes.

01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.200
A stinger, please. A stinger.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:23.200
- That's a whore's drink.
- I am a whore.

01:47:23.300 --> 01:47:25.400
- How many?
- Three upstairs. KGB.

01:47:25.500 --> 01:47:28.900
- Maybe more down here.
- OK. What's the score?

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.700
- I'll give you one, two, three.
- OK. Shoot.

01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:33.400
One.

01:47:33.500 --> 01:47:38.400
Osborne is deceiving KGB into a swap.
Six sables for Irina and me, plus dollars.

01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:43.900
- But he's got more out than they know.
- When's the swap?

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:47.200
- Tomorrow. They've bought it.
- OK. Two.

01:47:47.900 --> 01:47:52.500
Two. I am under orders from Moscow
to kill Osborne and the sables.

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:56.400
- Three.
- Three. The KGB kills Osborne,

01:47:56.500 --> 01:47:59.900
you, the girl and the sables.
Am I right?

01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:03.500
- Correct.
- Does she know this?

01:48:04.300 --> 01:48:05.900
No.

01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:14.000
- You're in a hell of a jam. Did I tell you?
- Yes, thank you. Eat some of my peanuts.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:16.700
I'll be there. Good luck.

01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:19.900
- What are you doing?
- This is a whore's drink.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.500
- Give me that. Let's get out of here.
- We've got an early start.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.800
Son of a bitch.

01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:34.300
<i>(Renko) Oh, no. </i>

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:40.700
- Don't touch him.
- Oh...

01:49:41.700 --> 01:49:43.500
God, no.

01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:46.600
What are you up to, Renko?
What's he doing here?

01:49:46.700 --> 01:49:49.800
- What the hell is going on?
- Who is it? Who?

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:53.800
A friend.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
<i>(Osborne) He killed my dogs. </i>

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:03.700
I gutted him because he killed my dogs.

01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:07.200
<i>(Pribluda) Now, Mr. Osborne. </i>

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:10.700
Let's not concern ourselves
with the intruder.

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:13.500
Are these the six sables?

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:17.600
The sables are dead.
Throw down your guns.

01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:20.900
Not while you have yours.

01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:25.100
Mr. Osborne, everything is correct now.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.600
You may take Renko here. We take
the sables. No one needs guns.

01:50:30.300 --> 01:50:34.600
<i>(Osborne) The sables are dead.
I do not intend to join them. </i>

01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.400
<i>(Pribluda) We're not thugs, Mr. Osborne. </i>

01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:41.000
If that's what you want,
you may have our weapons.

01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:44.100
- Rurik, Osborne will kill you.
- Stay out of this, you.

01:50:44.100 --> 01:50:48.100
Wake up. He'll kill all
of you, except Pribluda.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.600
- What?
- Pribluda is Osborne's man.

01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:54.800
- That's why he'll give up his gun.
- Renko, you're a liar.

01:50:58.300 --> 01:51:00.300
<i>(dog growls)</i>

01:51:02.100 --> 01:51:03.900
<i>(dog yelps)</i>

01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:15.400
<i>(Pribluda) It's all right. Renko is unarmed. </i>

01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:19.700
<i>- I made sure of that.
- (Osborne) Put the gun down. </i>

01:51:19.800 --> 01:51:23.100
- What?
- Put down the gun.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.300
Jack...

01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.400
listen.

01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:36.400
I've got the money.

01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.700
<i>(Renko) Mr. Osborne. </i>

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:49.400
On your right there are two more KGB.

01:51:57.900 --> 01:52:00.700
Keep your head down.

01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.300
<i>(gunshot)</i>

01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:12.600
<i>(growling)</i>

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.500
Holy Peter.

01:53:41.700 --> 01:53:43.700
<i>(sables growling)</i>

01:54:07.100 --> 01:54:09.900
<i>(Irina) Arkasha!</i>

01:54:09.900 --> 01:54:11.900
Irina, stay out!

01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:34.500
Step out, Renko.

01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.700
Or the girl is dead.

01:54:39.900 --> 01:54:41.900
No, Arkasha.

01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.800
Renko.

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:47.000
That's a KGB gun.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:11.400
Now we can be free.

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:21.200
Arkasha?

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:27.300
Irina.

01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:31.600
I have to go back.

01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.300
No.

01:56:34.700 --> 01:56:38.600
I have to go back, otherwise
they will hunt you down.

01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:40.700
That was...

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:47.200
That was the deal I made in Moscow.
Kill the sables. Kill Osborne. Go back.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:50.900
And you could go free.

01:56:52.300 --> 01:56:54.100
No.

01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.700
No.

01:57:01.100 --> 01:57:03.200
Irina, look at me.

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.900
No, look at me.

01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:10.500
What do you see?

01:57:12.300 --> 01:57:14.300
A Russian.

01:57:15.300 --> 01:57:18.100
I never could be anything else.

01:57:21.100 --> 01:57:23.600
- Then I'll come back.
- No.

01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:26.500
You were dead there. Dying there.

01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.000
I will always...

01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:35.500
love you.

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.400
Arkasha.

01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:04.100
One day, Irina.

01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:09.800
One day.

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:03.200
Chief Investigator Renko reporting
for duty, Comrade General.

01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:48.700
<i>(Irina) One day, Arkasha. </i>

01:59:48.700 --> 01:59:50.700
<i>One day. </i>

02:03:01.700 --> 02:03:05.500
