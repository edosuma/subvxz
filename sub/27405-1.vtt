28:48.623 --> 28:51.857

28:51.859 --> 28:54.360

as the Star of Babel,

28:54.362 --> 28:57.831

29:12.480 --> 29:15.315
believed that he could close
the gates of Heaven and Hell

29:15.317 --> 29:17.917
and rule Earth himself
without interference

29:17.919 --> 29:20.355
from their ruler Lucifer.

29:21.856 --> 29:24.993

anything to do with anything?

29:27.763 --> 29:30.265
Maybe very little,
maybe quite a lot.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.636
You'll find reference in
there to a man named Terric.

29:34.804 --> 29:36.235
He believed he could
do the same thing

29:36.237 --> 29:37.773

Horseman of the Apocalypse.
