Previously on Nancy Drew...

00:02.545 --> 00:04.355
Your DNA wasn't a match for the female hair.

00:04.399 --> 00:07.355
It's a mother-daughter
match for Lucy Sable.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.660
She's me.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.490
The baby is me.

00:15.363 --> 00:19.976
You had every opportunity
to tell me the truth.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.760
But you didn't,
because you hoped

00:21.804 --> 00:25.199
that I would never find out
that Lucy was my mother.

00:25.242 --> 00:30.204
Every day for 19 years, you woke
up and you chose to lie to me.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.119
And what did Kate think?

00:32.162 --> 00:33.990
Your mom... N-N-No.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.428
What did Kate think?
Did she have second thoughts?

00:37.472 --> 00:39.735
Is that why you sent me away
from her

00:39.778 --> 00:41.258
when she was on her deathbed?

00:41.302 --> 00:43.217
So that you didn't have some
attack of conscience and then

00:43.260 --> 00:46.916
tell me that Ryan Hudson
is my biological father?

00:46.959 --> 00:48.309
Oh, my God... All we knew

00:48.352 --> 00:49.745
was what Lucy told us.

00:49.788 --> 00:51.181
She begged us to protect you.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.096
She said you wouldn't be safe

00:53.140 --> 00:54.576
if the Hudsons found out

00:54.619 --> 00:56.317
who you really were.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.885
Nancy, Lucy gave you to us

00:59.929 --> 01:02.801
and begged us to raise you.
It was her dying wish.

01:02.845 --> 01:06.762
What would have happened if I
hadn't ever tested Lucy's DNA?

01:06.805 --> 01:10.331
How long would you have kept
up this-this master deception?

01:10.374 --> 01:11.636
Your mother and I... Stop calling her

01:11.680 --> 01:13.029
my mother!

01:13.073 --> 01:14.770
We both agreed it was best

01:14.813 --> 01:16.032
not to tell you. Why, why...?

01:16.076 --> 01:18.208
That it would be best... No, listen.

01:18.252 --> 01:21.385
Why-why did you bury her dress
in the backyard?

01:21.429 --> 01:24.127
[speaking indistinctly]

01:24.171 --> 01:26.738
Why were you arguing
when you were digging it up?

01:26.782 --> 01:28.305
Kate was the one
who buried the dress.

01:28.349 --> 01:31.613
For her, I think it was
some kind of link to Lucy.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.398
And when she told me, I
asked her to get rid of it,

01:34.442 --> 01:36.226
and she didn't.
She hid it in the attic.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.054
I guess she-she probably thought

01:38.098 --> 01:39.229
that nobody would
ever find it there

01:39.273 --> 01:40.752
because no one
ever went up there.

Yeah, apparently it's like a bloodhound.

with somebody else's.

so that, you know,

because if it can't find you,

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
it can't find any of us.

11:07.971 --> 11:10.104
Uh, but...

11:10.147 --> 11:13.498
the ritual has to be
done with a relative.

11:15.979 --> 11:17.981
Well, that's a problem.

It's not for me, okay, I'm
trying to get answers on Lucy.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.009
The court clerk gave me
a copy of her journal.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.706
Why?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.882
Why? Because my dad threatened her.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.233
I wanted to make sure he wasn't
being physically violent.

12:36.277 --> 12:38.714
I didn't see anything in
her journal about that,

12:38.758 --> 12:41.456
but I did... find this.

12:41.499 --> 12:43.806
Look, check it out.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.374
Early spring 2000, she's writing

12:46.417 --> 12:48.724
about being sick, queasy, her
clothes don't fit anymore.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.074

13:00.214 --> 13:01.998

13:02.042 --> 13:03.739
She would've kept it
a secret from her mom,

13:03.783 --> 13:06.263
'cause that woman was crazy,
but she could've snuck out

13:06.307 --> 13:09.223
to see a doctor, and the closest
free clinic is in Trenton.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.573
So I'm gonna go over there
and pay 'em a visit.

has changed by now.

13:13.662 --> 13:15.969
Nope, wrong, there's only one ob-gyn,

if Lucy had a baby?

13:26.414 --> 13:28.633
Because if she had a baby,

13:28.677 --> 13:31.506
then that baby's mine.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.943

21:38.993 --> 21:40.690
to exonerate my...

21:40.734 --> 21:42.388
to exonerate Carson.

21:42.431 --> 21:46.130
Um, my friends and
I did this ritual

21:46.174 --> 21:49.786
to call to this sea spirit.

21:49.830 --> 21:51.832
Sea spirit. Like-like dolphins?

21:51.875 --> 21:54.225
Stay with me.
It's, uh, it's a local legend.

21:54.269 --> 21:56.837
Uh, and it worked.
The Aglaeca answered my call.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.404
But the problem is...

21:58.447 --> 22:01.581
is I couldn't hold up
my end of the bargain.

22:01.624 --> 22:06.281
The-the Aglaeca wanted
Owen Marvin's blood.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.501
All of it. So we couldn't
go through with it,

22:08.544 --> 22:10.894
and now we triggered
this, uh, curse,

22:10.938 --> 22:12.809
and I have to fix it.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.029
And in order to do that,
I need to do another ritual

22:15.072 --> 22:17.292
to make sure that the spirit
doesn't lock onto its target,

22:17.336 --> 22:18.902
and-and that's where
you come in.

22:18.946 --> 22:22.036
Why me? I mean, unless this
Aglaeca takes cash, then I'm...

22:22.079 --> 22:23.603
It's not about your
money this time, Ryan.

22:23.646 --> 22:26.083
It's about you,
specifically, because...

22:27.258 --> 22:28.782
It's a long story, uh,

22:28.825 --> 22:31.175
and one of which you don't
need to know all the details.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.655
But I-if you just come
with me...

22:32.699 --> 22:35.136
Yeah, no, of course. I mean,
it sounds urgent, so...

22:35.179 --> 22:37.051
It is. Okay, yeah.

22:37.094 --> 22:40.010
Uh, just out of curiosity,
though, if I...

22:40.054 --> 22:42.535
if I don't go and help, um,

22:42.578 --> 22:45.059
does this sea demon
come after Owen Marvin?

22:45.102 --> 22:48.105
'Cause there are some pros
and cons to him being dead.

22:49.672 --> 22:51.631
Excuse me? Well, I mean,

22:51.674 --> 22:53.894

competitor, you know?

22:53.937 --> 22:56.853
And I'll never forget that smug
little look he had on his face

22:56.897 --> 22:58.855
when he turned me down
when I asked him for help.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.422
He's gonna regret that.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.511
I need you to be serious right now.

23:02.555 --> 23:04.252

Wh-Why am I like what, Nancy?

23:16.003 --> 23:18.266

You've met my dad.

No! No.

23:23.184 --> 23:26.448
You, you chose to hide
your relationship with Lucy.

your corrupt parents' money

23:29.408 --> 23:31.801
over anything else in your life.

23:31.845 --> 23:33.760
You chose to step out
on Tiffany.

23:33.803 --> 23:36.371
That marriage was a
business proposal. You are

23:36.415 --> 23:40.723
an entitled, morally bankrupt legacy criminal

supposed to change all that?

Hey. Sorry to bother you.

And we know Nancy already
asked, but is there any way

25:16.819 --> 25:19.213
you would reconsider helping us
with this de-cursing blood ritual?

Before Lucy died,

she told us that the
Hudsons weren't safe.

36:07.556 --> 36:09.254
That meant you.

She died thinking
I abandoned her.

Nancy would've
been safe with me.

I'll sleep in my office loft,

I'll give you

No, stay in your house.
