WEBVTT

00:01.543 --> 00:04.045
Oh, you could fry an

00:01.543 --> 00:04.045
egg on my forehead.

00:04.087 --> 00:05.046
If you're getting up,

00:05.088 --> 00:06.966
would you get me

00:05.088 --> 00:06.966
another lemonade?

00:13.472 --> 00:14.974
Ready?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.310
(all sighing)

00:18.352 --> 00:21.229
Stevie's house has

00:18.352 --> 00:21.229
air conditioning.

00:21.271 --> 00:23.106

01:01.228 --> 01:04.899
We're not renting the

01:01.228 --> 01:04.899
fanciest place on the Big

01:01.228 --> 01:04.899
Island, but, you know,

01:04.940 --> 01:07.401
at least I'll have a place

01:04.940 --> 01:07.401
to work on my cliff diving.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.569
Wow.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.487
We're actually

01:08.610 --> 01:10.487
sharing a houseboat

01:10.529 --> 01:13.114
with Stevie's family on a man-

01:10.529 --> 01:13.114
made lake by the power plant.

01:13.156 --> 01:15.534
I don't want to meet the

01:13.156 --> 01:15.534
girl that would impress.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.579
Do not touch!

01:18.620 --> 01:20.789
I'm not.

01:21.832 --> 01:23.542
Hal. Let me see

01:21.832 --> 01:23.542
your bathing suit.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.168
No. All these ones

01:23.584 --> 01:25.168
you picked out

01:25.210 --> 01:26.545
are too big and baggy.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.713
Baggy is good.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.798
It's less surface

01:27.755 --> 01:29.798
area I have to shave.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.132
I like the little one.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.134
No, Hal, you always pop

01:31.174 --> 01:33.134
out of the little ones.

01:33.176 --> 01:34.219
I do not pop out.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.596
That was one time.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.347
Hal, the Kenarbans are

01:35.637 --> 01:37.347
conservative people.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.975
We're going to be in very

01:37.389 --> 01:39.975
close quarters with them.

01:40.017 --> 01:41.142
Now, you get the baggy ones.

01:41.184 --> 01:42.603
Let me just show you something.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.188
It better not be

01:42.644 --> 01:45.188
that suit in the egg.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.816
Don't say anything

01:45.230 --> 01:47.816
until you see it.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.944
MAN:

01:47.858 --> 01:49.944
Oh, whoa!

01:49.985 --> 01:51.820
Dewey.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.158
Can I see that spear gun?

01:58.452 --> 01:59.912
Sure.

02:06.585 --> 02:10.171
Now, don't tell me this

02:06.585 --> 02:10.171
doesn't do something for you.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.632
(gasps)

02:11.673 --> 02:13.174
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.552
I thought you were my wife.

02:15.594 --> 02:18.847
My wife has

02:15.594 --> 02:18.847
the exact same shape...

02:18.889 --> 02:20.057
(gasps)

02:21.016 --> 02:22.476
(gasps)

02:24.144 --> 02:25.395
(gasps)

02:25.437 --> 02:28.983
So, maybe when I get back,

02:25.437 --> 02:28.983
you know, if you wanted...

02:29.024 --> 02:30.776
Maybe I can

02:29.024 --> 02:30.776
give you a call.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.444
Maybe.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.198
(laughs):

02:34.613 --> 02:37.198
Whoa. Look at that guy.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.660
Psst. Psst.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.120
Do you know him?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.997
Who? That nutcase?

02:43.038 --> 02:44.205
Of course not.

02:44.247 --> 02:46.834
You want to help me

02:44.247 --> 02:46.834
choose a surfboard?

02:46.875 --> 02:47.793
Okay.

02:47.835 --> 02:48.919
Malcolm!

02:48.961 --> 02:51.421
Oh, for the love of...

02:52.255 --> 02:53.757
Excuse me.

02:55.550 --> 02:58.219
Oh! God, it's not me--

02:55.550 --> 02:58.219
it's the suit.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.721
I am a normal person!

02:59.763 --> 03:01.098
I'm here with my family.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.933
My son is right over... Malcolm!

03:02.975 --> 03:04.225
Come with me.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.225
No, no, no.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.103
I know how this looks,

03:04.267 --> 03:06.103
but I'm telling you...

03:06.145 --> 03:07.228
Malcolm!

03:07.270 --> 03:08.605
Wait, no, no, no.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.274
This is a complete

03:08.647 --> 03:11.274
misunderstanding.

03:15.154 --> 03:16.321
Dude, where were you?

03:16.363 --> 03:18.490
If Spangler finds out

03:16.363 --> 03:18.490
you blew off drill practice,

03:18.532 --> 03:19.658
he's going to kill you.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.410
I'm not afraid

03:19.700 --> 03:22.410
of Spangler anymore.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.038
Why aren't you in uniform?

03:24.079 --> 03:26.999
I'm leaving. I'm out of here.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.336
You can't just leave.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.336
Yes.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.921
I can. I just turned 18.

03:32.963 --> 03:35.716
I'm legally an adult and

03:32.963 --> 03:35.716
no one can tell me what to do.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.634
I'm getting

03:35.757 --> 03:37.634
the hell out of here.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.970
You're not going to graduate?

03:37.676 --> 03:39.970
Nope.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.263
I'm going to Alaska.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.891
Francis, it's

03:42.305 --> 03:43.891
crazy up there.

03:43.932 --> 03:48.645
You can make $45 an hour working

03:43.932 --> 03:48.645
on oil rigs or logging camps,

03:48.687 --> 03:51.314
and you don't even

03:48.687 --> 03:51.314
need a diploma.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.984
Wait, $45 an hour?

03:54.026 --> 03:55.986
That's  with

03:54.026 --> 03:55.986
room and board.

03:56.028 --> 04:00.991
You work a couple of years,

03:56.028 --> 04:00.991
and you're set for life.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.914
Something to

04:04.327 --> 04:06.914
remember me by.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.794
Do you realize

04:10.792 --> 04:12.794
how close your father came

04:12.836 --> 04:16.297
to being a registered

04:12.836 --> 04:16.297
sex offender?!

04:16.339 --> 04:18.299
A registered sex offender!

04:18.341 --> 04:21.678
And for what?

04:18.341 --> 04:21.678
For some trampy girl? For...

04:21.720 --> 04:23.513
Mom, please! I feel terrible.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.724
I completely

04:23.555 --> 04:25.724
understand what I did.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.018
I sold out

04:25.766 --> 04:28.018
my own father for a girl.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.394
It's, like, the worst

04:28.060 --> 04:29.394
thing I've ever done.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.355
We both agree,

04:29.436 --> 04:32.355
I'm a terrible person.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
For some girl

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
you don't even know!

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
Who wouldn't give you

04:34.357 --> 04:36.317
the time of day!

04:36.359 --> 04:38.904
That's the gratitude

04:36.359 --> 04:38.904
you showed your father.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.240
Hey, maybe I'm

04:38.946 --> 04:41.240
the good one after all.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.490
Here, Mom,

04:41.281 --> 04:42.490
for your throat.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.325
I put a little

04:42.532 --> 04:44.325
honey in it.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.326
That man gets

04:45.368 --> 04:46.620
one vacation a year,

04:46.661 --> 04:49.330
and this is how you start it.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.330
(phone ringing)

04:49.372 --> 04:51.541
You go and make it right!

04:53.293 --> 04:54.335
Hello.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.796
Dad's probably

04:54.377 --> 04:55.796
not  that  mad at me.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.422
I mean, it's not

04:55.837 --> 04:57.422
like I personally

04:57.464 --> 04:59.800
shoved him

04:57.464 --> 04:59.800
in the squad car, right?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.846
Dad, can I

05:03.470 --> 05:04.846
talk to you?

05:04.888 --> 05:06.556
Uh, no, not right now.

05:04.888 --> 05:06.556
I'm kind of busy.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.809
Reese, can you come in here

05:06.598 --> 05:08.809
and help me with something?

05:08.850 --> 05:10.060
Oh, sure, Dad.

05:10.102 --> 05:11.436
I love to be helpful

05:11.478 --> 05:13.188
Close the door.

05:17.400 --> 05:18.359
Absolutely not, Francis!

05:18.401 --> 05:20.070
Mom, you're not listening.

05:20.112 --> 05:22.530
I can make $45 an hour.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.158
That's more than

05:22.572 --> 05:24.158
you or Dad makes.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.577
You are going

05:24.199 --> 05:27.577
to graduate from high school.

05:27.619 --> 05:28.662
Why spend the tuition?

05:28.703 --> 05:30.371
It's a total waste of money.

05:30.413 --> 05:31.832
We both know I'm failing.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.251
Okay,  now  we both know.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.462
Francis, you are going to stay

05:34.293 --> 05:37.462
in school until you graduate,

05:37.504 --> 05:40.299
and that's all there is to it,

05:37.504 --> 05:40.299
and if you flunk out,

05:40.339 --> 05:43.302
then that's just another year

05:40.339 --> 05:43.302
you're stuck there!

05:43.342 --> 05:44.385
You just can't stand the fact

05:44.427 --> 05:46.680
that I'll be making

05:44.427 --> 05:46.680
more money than you!

05:47.848 --> 05:49.474
(screams)

05:56.439 --> 05:59.026
Whoa, that was close.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.703
KITTY: Oh, look at all this

06:06.325 --> 06:09.703
lovely scenery and nature.

06:09.744 --> 06:12.413
This is going

06:09.744 --> 06:12.413
to be wonderful.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.125
Dear, did you pack my hat?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.251
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.919
You should have

06:16.293 --> 06:17.919
asked me to.

06:17.961 --> 06:18.920
No problem.

06:18.962 --> 06:22.423
I'll just create one

06:18.962 --> 06:22.423
out of newspaper.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.633
Everything okay?

06:23.675 --> 06:26.678
Everything's wonderful.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.678
We're on vacation.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.807
The whole drive up here,

06:28.138 --> 06:30.807
Dad wouldn't even look at me.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.810
I just wish I could take

06:30.849 --> 06:33.810
those two minutes back.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.730
That's the  King of the Seas?

06:37.522 --> 06:38.732
(shrieks)

06:38.773 --> 06:41.943
There's no TV! There's

06:38.773 --> 06:41.943
no TV! There's no TV!

06:41.985 --> 06:43.444
There's no TV!

06:43.486 --> 06:47.282
(chuckles)

06:43.486 --> 06:47.282
There's your TV.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.450
I don't see any TV.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.036
Excuse me.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.287
Okay.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.123
Dad, I'll help you

06:53.496 --> 06:55.123
with that.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.709
No, no. I've got it.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.044
Dad.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.379
Please, wait.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.546
Come on.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.464
Talk to me, please.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.385
Okay, fine.

07:06.425 --> 07:07.468
(laughs)

07:07.510 --> 07:09.554
I wanted to wait

07:07.510 --> 07:09.554
until this afternoon,

07:09.596 --> 07:11.306
but what the heck.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.600
Check this out.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.353
It's a Cavanaugh.

07:16.395 --> 07:17.562
You remember last year

07:17.604 --> 07:19.480
you saw a picture in a magazine

07:19.522 --> 07:21.191
of a father and a son

07:19.522 --> 07:21.191
fishing together

07:21.233 --> 07:24.485
and you said, "Oh, I'd like

07:21.233 --> 07:24.485
to try that sometime"?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.737
Yeah?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.655
Yeah, well, I just kept

07:25.779 --> 07:27.655
looking at that picture

07:27.697 --> 07:29.950
and I was thinking

07:27.697 --> 07:29.950
about you and me

07:29.991 --> 07:32.535
and I... started putting

07:29.991 --> 07:32.535
a little money away,

07:32.577 --> 07:35.496
and, you know, I just...

07:35.538 --> 07:37.416
I got this for you.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.502
Oh, man, you wouldn't believe

07:38.792 --> 07:41.502
how hard this week has been.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.921
Every time that

07:41.544 --> 07:42.921
I looked at you,

07:42.963 --> 07:44.756
I wanted to spill

07:42.963 --> 07:44.756
the beans, but...

07:44.798 --> 07:47.342
This  is why you

07:44.798 --> 07:47.342
wouldn't talk to me?

07:47.384 --> 07:48.593
We'll take the dinghy out

07:48.635 --> 07:51.512
and we'll do some fishing,

07:48.635 --> 07:51.512
just the two of us.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.223
Great.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
See you on board, Skipper.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.355
Hey, guess who's

07:57.436 --> 08:00.355
still the good one.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.452
Do... (gasps)

08:13.493 --> 08:14.411
you... (gasps)

08:14.453 --> 08:15.662
I see it, too.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.750
Hey, boys, what

08:18.790 --> 08:20.750
are you doing?

08:20.792 --> 08:24.254
I don't know--

08:20.792 --> 08:24.254
what are  you  doing?

08:24.296 --> 08:25.839
(giggling)

08:25.880 --> 08:28.258
Where'd you

08:25.880 --> 08:28.258
get the boat?

08:28.300 --> 08:30.551
We stole it from

08:28.300 --> 08:30.551
our spirit camp.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.929
We're going to

08:30.593 --> 08:32.929
get cigarettes.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.222
Spirit camp?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.557
So you girls are...?

08:36.599 --> 08:37.558
Cheerleaders.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.936
Bad... (gasps)

08:39.978 --> 08:41.271
cheerleaders.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.565
Yeah. We haven't seen any boys

08:41.313 --> 08:44.565
in, like, six weeks.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.568
Even you guys

08:44.607 --> 08:47.568
are starting to look good.

08:47.610 --> 08:48.820
(giggling)

08:48.862 --> 08:51.239
Tammy!

08:55.118 --> 08:57.245
Wait.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.245
Where are you guys going?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.331
Follow us and find out.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.963
Get... (gasps)

09:07.005 --> 09:08.423
the boat!

09:10.800 --> 09:12.427
Ready to go fishing, son?

09:12.469 --> 09:14.012
Now?

09:12.469 --> 09:14.012
Sure.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.598
We're catching

09:14.054 --> 09:17.598
everyone's dinner.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.393
Now, don't you take this

09:17.640 --> 09:19.393
personally, all right?

09:19.434 --> 09:20.601
This is a special thing

09:20.643 --> 09:22.603
with Malcolm and me,

09:20.643 --> 09:22.603
just this one time.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.690
Too bad you can't

09:24.022 --> 09:25.690
come with us.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.026
Too bad we're taking the boat.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.039
Oh. Oh...

09:41.081 --> 09:42.790
Nope.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.125
At least Reese and Stevie

09:44.167 --> 09:46.836
are as bored

09:44.167 --> 09:46.836
and miserable as I am.

09:48.671 --> 09:50.465
Remember...

09:50.507 --> 09:51.925
to call me...

09:51.966 --> 09:53.843
Snoop.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.643
(yelling)

10:02.685 --> 10:05.146
(all cheering)

10:12.487 --> 10:16.283
(yelling like Tarzan)

10:31.714 --> 10:32.673
(sighs)

10:31.714 --> 10:32.673
This is great--

10:32.715 --> 10:34.884
to just relax

10:32.715 --> 10:34.884
with adults.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.597
"Suffocate."

10:38.638 --> 10:41.308
Good for you, Abe.

10:46.563 --> 10:47.730
"Crybaby."

10:47.772 --> 10:49.608
I believe that's

10:47.772 --> 10:49.608
two words, dear.

10:49.649 --> 10:53.111
Okay, then... just "baby."

10:55.738 --> 10:57.282
I heard what

10:55.738 --> 10:57.282
happened, cadet.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.700
My, my, my, all that splintered

10:57.324 --> 10:59.700
wood and broken glass.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.536
(clicks tongue)

11:01.578 --> 11:03.704
I brought you something.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.123
What's that?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.707
A hammer, cadet.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.918
I expect you to repair

11:06.749 --> 11:08.918
the trophy case.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.129
You'll find lumber

11:08.960 --> 11:11.129
in the common room.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.922
I have a nine-inch gash

11:11.171 --> 11:12.922
in my leg.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.717
Hmm, that's quite a handicap.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.718
Cadet,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.720
you damaged school property

11:19.762 --> 11:22.723
and you are the one

11:19.762 --> 11:22.723
responsible for repairing it.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.726
Consider it a character

11:22.765 --> 11:25.726
building lesson.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.312
I didn't damage anything.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.729
That was negligence.

11:28.771 --> 11:31.316
The phone was improperly

11:28.771 --> 11:31.316
connected to the wall.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.567
That is totally unfair!

11:32.609 --> 11:35.236
I decide

11:32.609 --> 11:35.236
what's fair around here.

11:35.278 --> 11:38.031
But, wait,

11:35.278 --> 11:38.031
maybe I've been hasty.

11:38.072 --> 11:41.201
No, now that I've reconsidered,

11:38.072 --> 11:41.201
the decision stands.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.744
You will fix the damage

11:41.242 --> 11:43.744
by the end of the week.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.497
That is all, cadet.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.667
(grunts)

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
Dewey, you have to

11:49.792 --> 11:51.752
let go of the rope.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.129
You're all sunburned.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.047
No.

11:54.088 --> 11:54.922
Just let go.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.634
It's going to be dark soon.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.426
I can't.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.469
Yes, you can.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.179
Just open your fingers.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.389
But I'll fall.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.557
That's the point.

12:03.598 --> 12:04.765
Dewey, just don't think.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.560
Just do it, just let go.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.645
No!

12:06.601 --> 12:08.645
Oh, for crying out loud.

12:08.687 --> 12:12.607
You let go of that rope,

12:08.687 --> 12:12.607
and you come in for dinner!

12:13.233 --> 12:14.651
Come on, honey.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.860
No... ow!

12:15.902 --> 12:18.154
Come on, honey,

12:15.902 --> 12:18.154
I'm making French fries.

12:18.196 --> 12:19.698
Ow!

12:19.738 --> 12:20.781
Your favorite--

12:19.738 --> 12:20.781
ice cream.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.783
You know you love ice cream.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.079
HAL: And it was wriggling

12:22.825 --> 12:26.079
and fighting me.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.788
But finally I got it

12:26.120 --> 12:27.788
on the hook.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.165
That was one hell

12:27.830 --> 12:29.165
of a worm.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.792
Thought for sure

12:29.207 --> 12:31.792
I'd catch something with it.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.212
Oh, Dewey, would you

12:31.834 --> 12:34.212
pass the salt, please?

12:37.131 --> 12:38.508
Where'd you get

12:37.131 --> 12:38.508
that shiner?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.051
Mom.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.095
It was horrible.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.805
We were stuck

12:42.136 --> 12:44.805
out there for hours.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.433
It was so boring.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.312
What are you smiling about?

12:51.354 --> 12:52.855
I like these potatoes.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.441
(both laugh)

12:54.482 --> 12:56.067
You guys went to the camp?

12:56.109 --> 12:58.069
Oh, man, what was it like?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.988
Imagine a hundred fat guys

12:58.111 --> 13:00.988
falling down stairs,

13:01.030 --> 13:02.490
knocking over old ladies.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.744
Multiply that by ten,

13:02.532 --> 13:05.744
and you're not even close.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.827
STEVIE:

13:05.784 --> 13:06.827
Until today...

13:06.869 --> 13:10.457
I'd have traded...

13:10.498 --> 13:14.669
my life... for anybody's.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.550
No way. It's Mom's.

13:20.592 --> 13:22.552
If it were Mom's...

13:22.594 --> 13:24.554
would I do this?

13:24.596 --> 13:26.306
(sniffing)

13:26.347 --> 13:27.848
(sighs)

13:28.807 --> 13:31.852
That was delicious.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.023
I am so sorry about Abe.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.066
What do you mean?

13:37.108 --> 13:38.859
Oh, you're sweet to pretend,

13:38.901 --> 13:41.362
but I know he is ruining

13:38.901 --> 13:41.362
everyone's vacation

13:41.404 --> 13:44.240
with his pouting

13:41.404 --> 13:44.240
and his sarcastic little digs.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.867
Well, if it's bothering you,

13:44.282 --> 13:46.867
you should talk to him.

13:46.909 --> 13:47.868
(sighs)

13:47.910 --> 13:50.871
Sure is a beautiful night.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.290
You're right.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.917
Anything is better than this.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
Malcolm, better

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
hit the hay.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.880
We're getting up

13:56.919 --> 13:59.880
pretty early tomorrow.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.591
Nighty... night.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.883
(both laugh)

14:02.925 --> 14:04.803
ABE: Oh, I'll tell you

14:02.925 --> 14:04.803
what the problem is.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.304
I hate this boat!

14:06.346 --> 14:07.472
I hate this place!

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
I hate everything about

14:07.514 --> 14:09.182
this damn vacation!

14:09.223 --> 14:10.891
KITTY: Then why didn't

14:09.223 --> 14:10.891
you say anything?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.310
ABE: What difference

14:10.933 --> 14:12.310
would it make?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.355
This whole trip was your idea,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.355
and God knows,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.898
whatever Kitty wants,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.898
Kitty gets!

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
KITTY: Stop behaving like

14:17.940 --> 14:19.900
a total ass.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.361
You're ruining

14:19.942 --> 14:21.361
everyone's vacation.

14:21.402 --> 14:23.988
ABE: I could be sitting

14:21.402 --> 14:23.988
in a suite in Hawaii right now!

14:24.030 --> 14:26.199
KITTY: You know these people

14:24.030 --> 14:26.199
can't afford that.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.909
ABE: Well, pardon me

14:26.240 --> 14:28.909
for going to college

14:28.951 --> 14:30.203
and earning

14:28.951 --> 14:30.203
a decent living.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.414
Should I drive a crappy car

14:30.244 --> 14:33.414
because they do, too?

14:33.456 --> 14:35.916
No, they cannot hear me.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.003
And even if they could,

14:35.958 --> 14:39.003
they'd certainly understand

14:39.045 --> 14:41.922
that it's just

14:39.045 --> 14:41.922
my puckish sense of humor.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.842
Oh, it will, too, work.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.092
They're not that smart.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.928
Turn on the radio.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.928
Yeah.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.224
(snoring)

14:51.265 --> 14:53.184
(loud snoring)

14:59.982 --> 15:02.360
(loud snoring continues)

15:24.591 --> 15:27.802
♪ ♪

15:34.016 --> 15:35.769
116...

15:35.810 --> 15:38.646
What?

15:35.810 --> 15:38.646
Nothing.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.444
117...

15:44.485 --> 15:46.362
You know, I didn't want it

15:44.485 --> 15:46.362
to come to this,

15:46.404 --> 15:48.489
but there's only so far

15:46.404 --> 15:48.489
a person can be pushed.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.990
You don't have

15:48.531 --> 15:49.990
to persuade me.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.076
This is exactly

15:50.032 --> 15:52.076
the kind of injustice

15:52.118 --> 15:54.913
the Alabama legal system

15:52.118 --> 15:54.913
was designed to address.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.415
Now, just sign here.

15:58.875 --> 16:02.420
And we'll need your parent's

15:58.875 --> 16:02.420
signatures at the bottom.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
Great.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.013
I'm a notary

16:11.095 --> 16:13.013
as well as a lawyer,

16:13.055 --> 16:14.515
so I can have this expedited.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.643
Great.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.729
(phone ringing)

16:19.771 --> 16:21.439
(high-pitched voice):

16:19.771 --> 16:21.439
Hello.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.024
Well, he's in with a client

16:21.481 --> 16:24.024
right now.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.110
Can he call you back?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.613
What's your name, sugar?

16:28.655 --> 16:31.031
Mom, no, please!

16:28.655 --> 16:31.031
We can't watch Dewey.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.116
We already have plans.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.868
And now they include

16:32.158 --> 16:33.868
your brother.

16:33.910 --> 16:34.869
Mom...

16:34.911 --> 16:36.078
This isn't

16:34.911 --> 16:36.078
a negotiation.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.038
You're going to take

16:36.120 --> 16:38.038
your brother with you

16:38.080 --> 16:39.749
and you're going

16:38.080 --> 16:39.749
to have fun with him!

16:39.791 --> 16:42.168
(whimpering)

16:44.086 --> 16:47.841
Now, remember,

16:44.086 --> 16:47.841
this is a magic buoy.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.049
Mermaids are drawn to it,

16:49.091 --> 16:50.134
and they'll grant

16:49.091 --> 16:50.134
your every wish.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.094
But they won't show up

16:52.136 --> 16:53.930
if there's more than

16:52.136 --> 16:53.930
one person here.

16:53.972 --> 16:54.973
Just leave.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.350
Don't insult me.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.496
Hi, Malcolm.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.374
Me and my naked friends

17:18.538 --> 17:21.374
got tired of waiting for you.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.586
You don't want that jerk Reese

17:21.415 --> 17:25.586
to have all the fun, do you?

17:25.628 --> 17:27.797
(gasps)

17:25.628 --> 17:27.797
What happened?

17:27.839 --> 17:29.382
You catch something?

17:29.423 --> 17:30.383
No.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.510
We're never going

17:30.424 --> 17:32.510
to catch anything.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.803
I know.

17:33.845 --> 17:37.097
This is really

17:33.845 --> 17:37.097
awful, isn't it?

17:37.139 --> 17:39.099
I don't think

17:37.139 --> 17:39.099
there's a darned fish

17:39.141 --> 17:41.101
in this whole lake.

17:41.143 --> 17:43.521
You know what,

17:41.143 --> 17:43.521
it doesn't matter.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.858
It's just nice being

17:43.563 --> 17:46.858
out here with you.

17:49.443 --> 17:50.778
Dad?

17:50.820 --> 17:51.905
Hmm?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.364
You know the other day

17:51.946 --> 17:53.364
at the store

17:53.406 --> 17:55.366
when I pretended

17:53.406 --> 17:55.366
not to know you?

17:55.408 --> 17:56.283
Yeah.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.118
That was a new low.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.497
Well, there was

17:58.160 --> 18:01.497
this girl...

18:01.539 --> 18:02.790
Really?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.711
I'm sorry.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.005
I know.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.215
Ooh, looks like

18:11.257 --> 18:12.508
you got a nibble.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.053
Attaboy. Set the hook.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.053
Set the hook.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.013
Yeah, let him run.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.013
Let him run.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.139
Okay, now reel him in.

18:17.055 --> 18:19.139
Reel him in.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
Attaboy. Attaboy.

18:19.181 --> 18:21.141
Look at that!

18:21.183 --> 18:23.603
(laughs)

18:21.183 --> 18:23.603
Come to Papa, baby.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.731
You betcha. Oh, yeah!

18:26.773 --> 18:28.608
Oh! That's a striper!

18:28.649 --> 18:30.150
(both laughing)

18:30.192 --> 18:32.152
Look at that beauty!

18:30.192 --> 18:32.152
Way to go, Malcolm!

18:32.194 --> 18:33.654
Thanks, Dad.

18:33.696 --> 18:34.614
(girls laughing)

18:34.655 --> 18:36.824
He's four pounds

18:34.655 --> 18:36.824
if he's an ounce.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.785
Yeah.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.578
(girls laughing)

18:49.503 --> 18:50.880
Huh.

18:50.922 --> 18:52.172
Isn't this your brother's shirt?

18:53.215 --> 18:55.301
(motor revving, Hal screams)

19:07.021 --> 19:08.481
(panting)

19:09.231 --> 19:10.858
Why?

19:15.029 --> 19:18.198
You are in so much trouble!

19:18.240 --> 19:21.119
I know!

19:21.160 --> 19:23.079
I can't believe it either.

19:23.121 --> 19:25.331
Hi, Dewey!

19:37.426 --> 19:39.679
If you'll excuse

19:37.426 --> 19:39.679
me, dear,

19:39.720 --> 19:44.142
I believe I'll go take a nap

19:39.720 --> 19:44.142
on my luxurious foam pad.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.937
How long are you going

19:45.309 --> 19:47.937
to let this go on?

19:47.979 --> 19:50.314
I tried to talk to him.

19:47.979 --> 19:50.314
It just didn't help.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.232
Maybe you came

19:50.356 --> 19:52.232
on too strong.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.526
You can start by

19:52.274 --> 19:53.526
apologizing.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.695
You don't have

19:53.567 --> 19:55.695
to mean it.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.488
Look, you have one day

19:55.736 --> 19:57.488
of vacation left.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.157
You want to spend it like this?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.117
All right.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.161
I can swallow my pride.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.167
Kitty (yelling):

20:06.288 --> 20:09.167
And you think you're

20:06.288 --> 20:09.167
some kind of a picnic?!

20:09.208 --> 20:11.251
With your

20:09.208 --> 20:11.251
long-suffering sighs

20:11.293 --> 20:14.172
and your pouting

20:11.293 --> 20:14.172
and your 2:00 a.m. crying jags?!

20:14.213 --> 20:18.051
You are a big,

20:14.213 --> 20:18.051
overindulged mama's boy!

20:18.092 --> 20:19.343
ABE:

20:18.092 --> 20:19.343
And you are an uptight,

20:19.385 --> 20:22.513
impossible-to-please

20:19.385 --> 20:22.513
control freak!

20:22.555 --> 20:24.140
I can't take it anymore!

20:24.182 --> 20:26.266
KITTY: Well, what you going

20:24.182 --> 20:26.266
to do about it, mama's boy?

20:26.308 --> 20:29.687
Huh? What's the big mama's boy

20:26.308 --> 20:29.687
going to do about it?!

20:29.729 --> 20:31.731
(thud)

20:31.772 --> 20:33.273
(loud crash)

20:33.315 --> 20:35.735
Oh, my God.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.197
♪ ♪

20:39.238 --> 20:40.280
Sorry.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.490
I thought you were fighting.

20:41.532 --> 20:44.284
I didn't see anything.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.582
Oh, dear God.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
Three weeks

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
of slave labor,

20:53.794 --> 20:57.006
my relationship with Dad

20:53.794 --> 20:57.006
will never be the same,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.674
and I can't

20:57.048 --> 20:58.674
stop smiling.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.552
Dewey, remember when

20:58.716 --> 21:01.552
we were both stuck on the buoy

21:01.594 --> 21:04.097
and you said you wanted

21:01.594 --> 21:04.097
to be a ventriloquist?

21:04.138 --> 21:07.558
Well, I thought it was

21:04.138 --> 21:07.558
something we could do together.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.310
Thanks, Dad.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.230
You're welcome, son.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.898
LOIS:

21:12.271 --> 21:13.898
Oh, my God!

21:13.940 --> 21:14.941
What is it?

21:14.982 --> 21:17.401
It's Francis!

21:17.443 --> 21:19.361
He quit school.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.322
He's on his way to Alaska.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.616
Well, that's ridiculous.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.243
He can't just take

21:23.657 --> 21:25.243
himself out of school.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.326
He has to have our permission.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.494
No, he doesn't.

21:27.536 --> 21:30.330
He got himself

21:27.536 --> 21:30.330
legally emancipated.
