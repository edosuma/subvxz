WEBVTT

00:28.071 --> 00:31.683
THE HUMAN MIND IS
A VAST UNIVERSE,

00:31.770 --> 00:36.253
AN INNER COSMOS THAT WE ARE
ONLY NOW BEGINNING TO EXPLORE.

00:36.340 --> 00:38.647
OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

00:38.734 --> 00:42.129
ONE OF THE NATION'S
LEADING COSMONAUTS,

00:42.216 --> 00:45.915
A RISING STAR
IN THE FIELD OF NEUROSCIENCE,

00:46.002 --> 00:49.745
AND A PRIZED MEMBER
OF THE LEYLAND FACULTY.

00:49.832 --> 00:53.444
I GIVE YOU ALEX NELSON.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.925
[cheers and whistles]

01:00.364 --> 01:03.541
[mouths words]

01:03.628 --> 01:06.153
NO, NO, NO. THANK YOU.
NO. STOP.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.898
[cheering continues]

01:19.949 --> 01:21.081
[audience gasps]

01:28.566 --> 01:29.698
[crowd murmuring]

01:30.873 --> 01:32.266
[telephone rings]

01:32.353 --> 01:33.789
CBI. RIGSBY.

01:33.876 --> 01:35.530
MM-HMM. YEAH.

01:35.617 --> 01:39.621
JANE, PHONE FOR YOU.
SOMEONE CALLED SOPHIE MILLER.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.449
UH...

01:41.536 --> 01:43.929
T--UH, T-T-TELL HER
I'M NOT HERE.

01:44.016 --> 01:46.497
OKAY.

01:46.584 --> 01:50.414
I'M SORRY, MA'AM.
HE'S NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.NO, NO, NO, NO. WAIT. WAIT.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.112
I'LL, UH, PUT YOU THROUGH.

01:54.592 --> 01:56.333
DR. MILLER?

01:56.420 --> 01:58.422
YEAH, THIS IS PATRICK.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.519
HEY.HEY. IF SOMEONE'S MURDERED
ON THE CAMPUS

02:08.606 --> 02:14.134
OF A UNIVERSITY, IT'S OURS,
RIGHT?IT CAN BE. WHY'D YOU ASK?

02:14.221 --> 02:15.309
I NEED A FAVOR.

02:20.052 --> 02:22.359
SOPHIE,
ALEX NELSON'S WATER BOTTLE

02:22.446 --> 02:25.406
CONTAINED A 10% SOLUTION
OF HYDROGEN CYANIDE.

02:25.493 --> 02:29.410
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?I KNOW THAT HYDROGEN CYANIDE
IS A LETHAL POISON.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.194
BEYOND THAT, NOTHING AT ALL.

02:31.281 --> 02:33.849
PLEASE, CALL ME "MISS MILLER"
OR "DR. MILLER" OR "MA'AM."

02:33.936 --> 02:35.372
NOT SOPHIE, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.896
YOU'RE NOT SETTING
THE BOUNDARIES HERE.

02:37.983 --> 02:39.768
YOU WERE SEEN
BY SEVERAL WITNESSES

02:39.855 --> 02:42.553
ARGUING WITH THE VICTIM
SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.642
YOU FLED THE SCENE
IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS DEATH.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.862
A CUNNING PLAN, EH?

02:49.647 --> 02:52.389
SINCE YOUR DIVORCE
FROM THE VICTIM TWO YEARS AGO,

02:52.476 --> 02:55.349
YOU'VE BEEN ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULTING HIM TWICE

02:55.436 --> 02:58.134
AND MADE SEVERAL DEATH THREATS
AGAINST HIM.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.918
HE OBTAINED A RESTRAINING ORDER
AGAINST YOU.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.225
AND I OBTAINED
ONE AGAINST HIM ALSO.

03:02.312 --> 03:07.448
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT THEN.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.493
IT DIDN'T BOTHER YOU
THAT ALEX HAD REMARRIED,

03:09.580 --> 03:11.539
THAT HE FOUND HAPPINESS
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN?

03:11.626 --> 03:14.194
ALEX AND I GOT PAST
OUR PERSONAL HISTORY.

03:14.281 --> 03:16.718
WE HAD TO, FOR THE SAKE
OF OUR WORK TOGETHER.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.372
AH, YES. YOU WORKED TOGETHER

03:18.459 --> 03:22.289
AT THE, UH,
STUTZER INSTITUTE, RIGHT?

03:22.376 --> 03:26.336
WHICH GAVE YOU READY ACCESS
TO THE HYDROGEN CYANIDE.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.860
I THOUGHT, BEING INNOCENT,
THAT I DON'T NEED A LAWYER,

03:28.947 --> 03:31.733
BUT I CAN SEE THAT YOU HAVE
SOME ANIMUS AGAINST ME,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.953
SO I'LL SAY NOTHING MORE
UNTIL I HAVE A LAWYER PRESENT.

03:38.392 --> 03:42.831
WHAT IF WE TAKE THIS CASE,
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE'S GUILTY?SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

03:42.918 --> 03:47.488
HOW DO YOU KNOW?BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME SHE DIDN'T.
SHE WOULDN'T LIE TO ME.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.794
WHY NOT?BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T.

03:49.881 --> 03:52.319
SUPPOSE SHE DID.

03:52.406 --> 03:57.628
WELL, IF SHE IS GUILTY,
THEN WE NEED TO CATCH HER
AND PUNISH HER, BUT SHE'S NOT.

03:57.715 --> 04:01.719
JANE, I KNOW I SAID
I WOULDN'T ASK, BUT I'M ASKING.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.809
WHO IS THIS WOMAN?
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?

04:04.896 --> 04:08.509
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

04:08.596 --> 04:12.817
♪♪

04:17.996 --> 04:20.825
SHE'LL TALK,
BUT SHE JUST NEEDS TIME.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.437
TO DO WHAT?

04:23.524 --> 04:25.439
I'M NOT SAYING
SHE ISN'T GOOD FOR IT.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.005
BUT WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH EVIDENCE

04:27.092 --> 04:29.704
TO SUPPORT THAT RIGHT NOW.I DISAGREE.

04:29.791 --> 04:32.489
AND THAT'S YOUR RIGHT, BUT
THE CBI's LEAD AGENCY ON THIS.

04:32.576 --> 04:36.188
YES. STRANGE, THOUGH, THAT
A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNIT

04:36.276 --> 04:39.104
LIKE CBI IS LEAD AGENCY,
'CAUSE SOPHIE MILLER CALLED

04:39.191 --> 04:41.106
THE D.O.J. SWITCHBOARD
THIS MORNING.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.283
YOU MIGHT ALMOST THINK
THAT SHE...

04:43.370 --> 04:45.981
CHOSE HER OWN INVESTIGATORS.LEYLAND IS A STATE UNIVERSITY.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.983
WE AUTOMATICALLY OFFER
OUR SERVICES

04:48.070 --> 04:50.246
WHEN LOCAL AGENCIES
AREN'T EQUIPPED.

04:50.333 --> 04:55.077
IF SOPHIE MILLER CALLED
THE D.O.J., IT'S A COINCIDENCE.

04:55.164 --> 05:00.430
WHAT IS IT, DROBEY?THIS WAS POSTED UP ALL OVER
LEYLAND CAMPUS DURING THE NIGHT.

05:04.869 --> 05:07.524
"THE ANIMAL EQUALITY LEAGUE
HAS SEEN JUSTICE SERVED.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.787
"THE BLOOD OF INNOCENT ANIMALS
WAS ON NELSON'S HANDS,

05:09.874 --> 05:13.095
AND HE HAS PAID THE PRICE
FOR HIS CRIMES."

05:13.182 --> 05:15.967
LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S MORE SUSPECTS NOW.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.144
THEY WANT THE ANIMAL TESTING

05:19.231 --> 05:21.799
AT LEYLAND UNIVERSITY
SCIENCE DEPARTMENT TO STOP,

05:21.886 --> 05:23.801
OR "THE MONSTER STUTZER
WILL BE NEXT

05:23.888 --> 05:25.977
TO PAY
FOR HIS GENOCIDAL CRIMES."

05:26.064 --> 05:27.631
WHO IS STUTZER?

05:27.718 --> 05:29.024
LEWIS STUTZER IS

05:29.111 --> 05:31.853
ONE OF THE WORLD'S
FOREMOST NEUROSCIENTISTS

05:31.940 --> 05:34.812
AND FOUNDER OF THE STUTZER
INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.120
AND, UM, WHAT IS HIS CONNECTION
TO THE VICTIM, ALEX NELSON?

05:38.207 --> 05:41.341
ALEX NELSON AND SOPHIE MILLER
ARE HIS COLLEAGUES,

05:41.428 --> 05:43.604
HIS SECONDS IN COMMAND.

05:43.691 --> 05:47.042
PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S
A GREAT DEAL AT STAKE HERE

05:47.129 --> 05:48.435
FOR THE UNIVERSITY.

05:48.522 --> 05:51.307
THE STUTZER INSTITUTE IS
OUR LYNCHPIN.

05:51.394 --> 05:53.222
I CAME TO SEE YOU IN PERSON

05:53.309 --> 05:57.182
TO GET YOUR FIRM ASSURANCE THAT
THIS WILL BE HANDLED PROPERLY,

05:57.269 --> 05:58.967
WITH SPEED AND DISCRETION

05:59.054 --> 06:02.753
AND IRONCLAD SECURITY
FOR DR. STUTZER.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.800
OF COURSE, CHANCELLOR STERN.
YOU HAVE MY ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.193
I WILL HAVE
A SQUAD OF STATE MARSHALS

06:08.280 --> 06:10.674
AROUND DR. STUTZER
WITHIN THE HOUR.

06:10.761 --> 06:13.198
AGENT LISBON AND HER TEAM WILL
HANDLE THE MURDER INVESTIGATION.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.897
THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST CLEARANCE
RATE IN THE STATE.

06:15.984 --> 06:16.985
GOOD.YEAH.

06:17.072 --> 06:19.857
THANK YOU.SIR.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.821
WHAT ARE YOU, NUTS?
AN ANIMAL RIGHTS CASE?

06:26.908 --> 06:29.824
YOU KNOW WHAT A NIGHTMARE
THEY ARE?I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.913
I DIDN'T REALIZE
IT'S AN ANIMAL RIGHTS CASE

06:32.000 --> 06:36.526
UNTIL TOO LATE.AND AT PUTT, STERN IS
GONNA BE A PAIN IN THE ASS.

06:36.613 --> 06:39.877
YOU BETTER CLOSE THIS CRAP
QUICK, LISBON.

06:48.146 --> 06:51.106
HEY, THANKS FOR NOT TELLING HIM
I MADE YOU TAKE THE CASE.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.631
LISBON? HELLO?

06:57.068 --> 06:58.766
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

06:58.853 --> 07:02.770
THE TRUTH?
DARTH VADER? LUKE'S FATHER.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.860
[slams drawer shut]SERIOUSLY, I'VE STUCK
MY STUPID NECK OUT FOR YOU

07:05.947 --> 07:07.339
FOR THE UMPTEENTH TIME.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.473
I THINK I DESERVE THE TRUTH.

07:14.172 --> 07:17.654
WHY IS SOPHIE MILLER
SO IMPORTANT TO YOU?

07:20.004 --> 07:23.312
SHE WAS MY DOCTOR.

07:23.399 --> 07:24.835
SHE'S A PSYCHIATRIST.

07:24.922 --> 07:28.099
YES,
SHE WAS MY PSYCHIATRIST.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.710
BUT YOU HATE PSYCHIATRISTS,

07:29.797 --> 07:33.453
SO YOU ALWAYS SAY.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.717
SHE WAS A GOOD PSYCHIATRIST.

07:36.804 --> 07:40.808
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN IF SHE
MANAGED TO KEEP YOU IN THE ROOM.

07:40.895 --> 07:43.811
IT WAS A LOCKED ROOM.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.075
OH.

07:52.863 --> 07:55.344
I WENT THROUGH A ROUGH PATCH,
WAS IN A HOSPITAL,

07:55.431 --> 08:01.132
AND SOPHIE HELPED ME
THROUGH THAT TIME.IT'S NOT ON YOUR RECORD.

08:01.219 --> 08:05.006
NO. BELIEVE ME.
I... IT S NOT EASY TO DO.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.534
I...

08:11.621 --> 08:13.841
I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING SHAMEFUL
ABOUT HAVING A BREAKDOWN,

08:13.928 --> 08:17.192
BUT I GOTTA CONFESS,
I AM ASHAMED OF IT.

08:20.848 --> 08:23.807
THANK YOU FOR BEING
SO HONEST WITH ME.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.809
SORRY I KEPT IT FROM YOU.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.814
[knock on door]

08:30.901 --> 08:33.121
UH...

08:33.208 --> 08:35.645
SHALL I COME BACK LATER?NO.

08:44.654 --> 08:47.178
RIGSBY STARTED IN
ON THE CAMPUS SECURITY TAPES.

08:47.265 --> 08:50.530
NOTHING YET. I'VE BEEN TRACKING
THIS ANIMAL EQUALITY LEAGUE.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.879
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.620
THEY BELIEVE IN ANIMAL EQUALITY,

08:53.707 --> 08:55.622
SO YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE NOT VERY HAPPY.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.146
THEY'VE TAKEN CREDIT
FOR SEVERAL FIREBOMBING ATTACKS

08:58.233 --> 09:01.758
ON SLAUGHTERHOUSES
AND ANIMAL TESTING FACILITIES.SERIOUS PEOPLE.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.673
I INTERVIEWED THE STAFF
AT THE AUDITORIUM.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.677
THERE'S NO SECURITY TO SPEAK
OF. ANYONE COULD HAVE POISONED
HIS WATER

09:07.764 --> 09:10.724
IT HAS NELSON'S PRINTS.
NOBODY KNOWS WHERE
HE GOT IT FROM.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.595
THE BRAND'S THE SAME
ALL OVER CAMPUS.

09:16.860 --> 09:17.992
I'M KERRY SHEEHAN,

09:18.079 --> 09:20.124
DR. STUTZER'S
TEACHING ASSISTANT.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.953
HE'S READY TO SEE YOU NOW.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.782
DID YOU KNOW
ALEX NELSON WELL?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.784
[beep]HE WAS A VERY GOOD MAN.

09:27.871 --> 09:30.352
HE WAS, UH...

09:30.439 --> 09:32.484
HE WAS A, UM...

09:32.572 --> 09:35.966
YES? HE WAS?

09:36.053 --> 09:37.707
HE WAS A GOOD, GOOD MAN.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.722
DR. STUTZER?HUH?

09:52.809 --> 09:54.376
WE'RE WITH THE CBI.

09:54.463 --> 09:57.422
OH. YEAH. YES, OF COURSE.
COME IN.

09:57.509 --> 10:00.164
AND SHUT THAT DOOR, PLEASE.
SIT DOWN.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.819
[sighs]

10:02.906 --> 10:05.822
TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE BUSINESS.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.956
ALEX WAS A FIRST-RATE
RESEARCHER. TRULY FIRST-RATE.

10:09.043 --> 10:13.830
I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MUCH
I AM GOING TO MISS HIM.I'M SORRY, DR. STUTZER.

10:13.917 --> 10:18.269
WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT--COULDN'T HAVE COME
AT A WORSE TIME.

10:18.356 --> 10:21.185
IT'S GOING TO SET US BACK
MONTHS, I'M AFRAID. MONTHS.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.492
WHAT IS IT YOU DO HERE EXACTLY,
DR. STUTZER?

10:23.579 --> 10:26.147
OUR WORK HERE
IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE.

10:26.234 --> 10:29.716
WHAT YOU TELL US REGARDING YOUR
WORK IS COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL.

10:29.803 --> 10:33.415
ALL CBI AGENTS SIGN A BINDING
NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT.

10:33.502 --> 10:36.113
VERY WELL.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.116
I WILL TELL YOU
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

10:39.203 --> 10:41.553
WE'RE CURING EVIL.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.860
HMM.
WE'RE BANISHING THE DEVIL.

10:43.947 --> 10:47.559
WE HAVE IDENTIFIED
A SECTION OF THE BRAIN

10:47.647 --> 10:50.780
THAT GOVERNS
MORAL DECISION MAKING.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.088
IT'S A SMALL FOLD OF TISSUE
CALLED THE CINGULATE GYRUS

10:54.175 --> 10:56.743
HERE IN THE MEDIAL PART
OF THE BRAIN.

10:56.830 --> 11:00.137
THIS IS THE SOURCE
OF GOOD AND EVIL.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.662
WE'VE LEARNED HOW IT WORKS
AND HOW TO READJUST IT

11:02.749 --> 11:04.925
WHEN IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY.

11:05.012 --> 11:10.191
WE'VE CREATED WHAT WE CALL
A MORALITY ENGINE.

11:10.278 --> 11:12.889
A MORALITY ENGINE?

11:12.976 --> 11:16.588
YOU ARE SKEPTICAL.
NEVERTHELESS, IT'S TRUE.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.287
WE ARE PLUMBING THE DEPTHS
OF THE HUMAN SOUL.

11:19.374 --> 11:23.421
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S THERE?
WHAT YOUR SOUL IS MADE OF?

11:23.508 --> 11:26.337
FROGS AND SNAILS
AND PUPPY DOGS' TAILS?

11:26.424 --> 11:30.124
AH. HUMOR. GOOD.

11:31.865 --> 11:33.823
THANK YOU, NO.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.782
YOUR SOUL IS ELECTRICITY.

11:35.869 --> 11:38.175
THE ESSENCE OF YOUR BEING IS

11:38.262 --> 11:42.136
A SERIES
OF RAPID ELECTRICAL IMPULSES.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.139
MORALITY IS A BINARY SWITCH
SYSTEM IN THE BRAIN,

11:45.226 --> 11:48.272
AND WE ARE LEARNING HOW
TO CONTROL THAT SWITCH SYSTEM.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.666
WHERE DO ANIMALS COME INTO THIS?

11:50.753 --> 11:54.496
WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO POKE
AROUND INSIDE HUMAN HEADS

11:54.583 --> 11:58.935
UNTIL WE HAVE DONE THE SAME
THINGS ON ANIMALS FIRST.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.245
[whispers]
CARL, WOULD YOU PLEASE....

12:09.859 --> 12:13.602
THIS IS SUSIE.

12:13.689 --> 12:16.126
[chuckles] WHEN SHE FIRST
ARRIVED, SHE WAS QUITE VIOLENT,

12:16.213 --> 12:17.649
ESPECIALLY OVER FOOD.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.088
WE RECALIBRATED
HER ANTERIOR CINGULATE GYRUS,

12:21.175 --> 12:27.355
AND NOW LOOK WHAT A HAPPY
AND GENEROUS GIRL SHE IS.

12:27.442 --> 12:30.532
OH.
THANK YOU.

12:30.619 --> 12:31.620
[coos]

12:31.707 --> 12:33.143
[chuckles]

12:38.670 --> 12:40.324
OOH. HUH. WHERE'D IT GO?

12:51.031 --> 12:55.644
[squealing]

12:55.731 --> 12:57.994
IS SUSIE HERE THE EXTENT
OF YOUR ANIMAL TESTING?

12:58.081 --> 13:00.867
OH, NO. THERE'S BEEN
OTHER CHIMPANZEES BEFORE HER,

13:00.954 --> 13:06.742
RATS, MICE, PIGEONS.HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THREATENED

13:06.829 --> 13:10.093
BY ANIMAL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS
BEFORE NOW?YES, OF COURSE.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.095
WHEN ONE IS
A PROMINENT SCIENTIST,

13:12.182 --> 13:14.576
ONE IS SOMETIMES MENACED
BY ANIMAL PEOPLE.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.621
IT'S ALWAYS NONSENSE.

13:16.708 --> 13:19.537
IN THIS CASE, WE MUST ASSUME
THE THREATS ARE VERY REAL.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.539
THE MARSHALS WILL PROVIDE
FULL PROTECTION,

13:21.626 --> 13:26.762
BUT YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.I AM NOT INTIMIDATED.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.460
THE WORK WE ARE DOING HERE
IS FAR TOO IMPORTANT.

13:29.547 --> 13:33.116
THAT IS WHY I HAVE THIS.[sets gun down, shuts drawer]

13:33.203 --> 13:36.728
IN THE LONG TERM,
THIS TECHNOLOGY

13:36.816 --> 13:39.949
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ERADICATE
VIOLENCE FROM HUMAN RELATIONS.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.039
THAT IS WHAT THESE ANIMAL RIGHTS
MANIACS DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:43.126 --> 13:47.478
WE ARE TRYING TO CREATE A WORLD
OF PEACE WHERE EVERYONE IS SAFE.

13:47.565 --> 13:49.829

OR "B," A HOMELESS MAN.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.864

15:03.903 --> 15:06.340
THANKS FOR GETTING ME OUT.OH, IT WASN'T ME.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.604
IT WAS THE ANIMAL EQUALITY
LEAGUE THAT SPRUNG YOU.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.345
IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

15:13.042 --> 15:16.698
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?GOOD. VERY GOOD.

THEIR DOCTORS HAVE
NO PROBLEMS THEMSELVES.

15:28.405 --> 15:32.540
WELL, WHO'D CONSULT
A SICK DOCTOR? [chuckles]

15:32.627 --> 15:34.803
IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS
I LEFT CLINICAL PRACTICE

15:34.890 --> 15:37.110
AND WENT INTO PURE RESEARCH.

15:37.197 --> 15:39.808
WHAT ARE THEY EXACTLY,

15:39.895 --> 15:41.897
WHAT'S THE STORY

ABOUT WORK.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.745
IS THIS AN INTERROGATION?

16:03.832 --> 16:05.747
NO, NO. I'M S--I'M SORRY.

16:05.834 --> 16:10.099

16:10.186 --> 16:12.188
OH, YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I OWE YOU.

16:12.275 --> 16:15.191
I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO REPAY

16:16.671 --> 16:18.194
BUT YOU'RE INNOCENT,

16:18.281 --> 16:21.328
SO WHY DO YOU NEED MY HELP?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.373
WHY AM I HERE?

16:23.460 --> 16:29.118

ABOUT 2,000 VEHICLES.

17:11.421 --> 17:14.468
TAKE A LOOK AT THE BACK WINDOW.

17:14.555 --> 17:17.253
IT LOOKS LIKE A CAT OR A DOG.IT'S A BEAR.

19:11.454 --> 19:13.239

MY WORK.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.458
WE WON'T KEEP YOU
LONGER THAN WE NEED.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.808
NOW THIS ANIMAL EQUALITY
LEAGUE--TELL ME ABOUT IT.

19:17.895 --> 19:22.770
IT'S A LEAGUE OF PEOPLE
WHO BELIEVE THAT ANIMALS
SHOULD BE EQUAL TO HUMANS.

19:22.857 --> 19:26.165

DO YOU REALIZE THAT

THAT'S ALWAYS
A GOOD PLACE TO START.YES, I THINK SO.

20:14.691 --> 20:18.739
FLOWERS FOR A FUNERAL. I DON'T
KNOW HOW MANY ARE NEEDED.

20:18.826 --> 20:21.698
IS THREE ARRANGEMENTS
TOO FEW?

20:21.785 --> 20:24.701
WELL,
HOW MUCH DO LILIES COST?

20:24.788 --> 20:27.443
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST SPEAK
TO CHANCELLOR STERN.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.446
HE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER IDEA.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.449
I'M SORRY.

20:33.536 --> 20:35.321
DEATH IS SO COMPLICATED.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.932
I'M EXPECTED TO ANSWER ALL THESE
QUESTIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING.

20:38.019 --> 20:40.761
MRS. NELSON, I JUST--PLEASE CALL ME EMILY.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.503
I NEVER REALLY GOT THE HANG
OF BEING CALLED "NELSON."

20:43.590 --> 20:44.721
CAN WE SIT?

20:50.336 --> 20:52.512
[Emily] I WAS GETTING
THE HANG OF BEING NEWLYWED,

20:52.599 --> 20:54.383
AND NOW I'M A WIDOW.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.038
DID YOU EVER FEEL
THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG

20:57.125 --> 20:59.040
IN ANY ASPECT OF ALEX'S LIFE?

20:59.127 --> 21:00.955
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

21:01.042 --> 21:04.045
I MEAN, WORK HAD BEEN REALLY
HARD LATELY. I KNOW THAT.

21:04.132 --> 21:05.568
IS THAT YOU?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.530
YES, THAT'S WHEN ALEX
AND I FIRST MET.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.706
HUH. CUTE PICTURE.

21:12.793 --> 21:15.274
WHY WAS WORK SO HARD?

21:15.361 --> 21:16.536
I DON'T KNOW.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.538
WHEN ALEX WOULD TALK
ABOUT HIS WORK,

21:18.625 --> 21:22.933
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD,
AND HE JUST STOPPED TRYING
AFTER A WHILE.

21:23.020 --> 21:26.415
BUT HE HAD AN ARGUMENT
ON THE PHONE A FEW WEEKS AGO.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.461
ALEX WENT INTO HIS OFFICE,

21:28.548 --> 21:31.681
AND I COULD HEAR HIM SHOUTING.
HE WAS SO ANGRY.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.684
HE NEVER SHOUTS.ANY IDEA
WHO HE WAS SHOUTING AT?

21:34.771 --> 21:37.034
I KNOW IT WAS A WOMAN.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.472

I THINK HE CALLED HER.

21:39.559 --> 21:42.779
ROSIE. DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY
NAMED ROSIE?

21:42.866 --> 21:46.740

21:49.569 --> 21:53.094
YEAH.YOU DIDN'T SUSPECT THAT THERE
WAS ANOTHER WOMAN INVOLVED?

21:53.181 --> 21:55.575

I HAVE TO ASK SUCH THINGS.

21:57.664 --> 21:59.230
SORRY.

22:01.363 --> 22:04.888

DID YOU DO THE DECORATING?NO, IT'S ALL ALEX.

22:04.975 --> 22:07.238
HE WAS TEACHING ME.
HE HAD AN AESTHETIC.

I WANT YOU TO GO

22:26.823 --> 22:28.434
JUST GET ON A PLANE.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.479
DON'T TELL ANYONE
WHERE YOU'RE GOING. JUST GO.

22:30.566 --> 22:34.265
FLY AWAY AND START BUILDING
A NEW LIFE FOR YOURSELF.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.702
[whispers] OKAY.

22:35.789 --> 22:38.400
OKAY. BUT YOU PROMISE ME
YOU WILL FIGHT HARD

22:38.487 --> 22:40.794

I'M SORRY.

22:45.842 --> 22:49.193
NO.[sniffles]

22:49.280 --> 22:52.806
SHE COULDN'T KILL ANYONE UNLESS
THEY TOLD HER IN A FIRM VOICE.

22:52.893 --> 22:54.677
THAT'S FUNNY. "DON'T LISTEN
TO CONTROL FREAKS."

22:54.764 --> 22:56.723
[high-pitched voice]
"WHATEVER YOU SAY, SIR."

22:56.810 --> 22:59.421
LET'S GO SEE
STUTZER'S ASSISTANT.

22:59.508 --> 23:02.163
KERRY SHEEHAN? WHAT, YOU THINK
SHE'S THE MYSTERIOUS ROSIE?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.731
THE WIDOW'S NOT A TRUE BLONDE.
SHE'S NATURALLY DARK.

23:04.818 --> 23:07.647
IS THAT YOU?YES. THAT'S WHEN ALEX AND I
FIRST MET.

23:07.734 --> 23:11.738
AND WHAT?AND HER HAIR IS COLORED
AND STYLED TO LOOK LIKE SOPHIE--

23:11.825 --> 23:14.305
ONLY YOUNGER--WHO WAS A BRUNET
WHEN I KNEW HER.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.657
SO NELSON WAS A CONTROL FREAK.A CONTROL FREAK
WITH A SERIOUS THING

23:17.744 --> 23:21.922
FOR GETTING HIS WOMEN
TO DYE THEIR HAIR BLOND.KERRY SHEEHAN HAS ROOTS.

23:22.009 --> 23:25.012
YES, SHE DOES.SHE AND ALEX NELSON
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR.

23:25.099 --> 23:26.361
BRAVO.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.407
DON'T PATRONIZE ME.

23:30.234 --> 23:33.194
[knock on door]

23:33.281 --> 23:35.283
[knock]

23:35.370 --> 23:36.806
[Lisbon] MISS SHEEHAN?

23:36.893 --> 23:40.201
KERRY?

23:40.288 --> 23:42.725
IT'S TERESA LISBON.

23:42.812 --> 23:46.250
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT ALEX NELSON.

23:50.864 --> 23:53.780
I NEED E.M.T.s
AT 9-6-5 ELM.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.047
HE WAS GOOD, GOOD MAN.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.488
TELL THEM
NOT TO RUN THE LIGHTS.

24:11.362 --> 24:13.364
LOOKS LIKE A SUICIDE.

24:24.375 --> 24:25.594
IS IT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE?

24:25.681 --> 24:28.205
YEAH. HOW PINK SHE WAS?
THAT'S CYANIDE.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.164
IT CAUSES
HIGH BLOOD-OXYGEN SATURATION.

24:30.251 --> 24:32.819
THANKS.

24:32.906 --> 24:34.516
LOOK AT THIS, BOSS.

24:34.603 --> 24:36.344
I FOUND THESE
IN THE GARBAGE UPSTAIRS.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.482
[Van Pelt]
THAT'S ALEX WITH THE VICTIM.

24:45.788 --> 24:48.617
IT'S NOT A TIDY END
TO THIS SAD SAGA,

24:48.704 --> 24:52.012
BUT IT IS AN END, AT LEAST.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.318
THANK YOU
FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK.

24:54.405 --> 24:57.496
WE'RE NOT DONE HERE.
IF KERRY SHEEHAN WAS A SUICIDE,

24:57.583 --> 25:02.413
THAT DOESN'T MAKE HER GUILTY
OF ALEX'S MURDER. IFSHE'S A SUICIDE?

25:07.375 --> 25:10.117
THE NOTE'S TOO BRIEF.
WOMEN LIKE TO EXPLAIN
THEMSELVES.

25:10.204 --> 25:14.382
I THINK IT'S A STAGED SUICIDE.PERHAPS SHE WAS ASHAMED
OF WHAT SHE'D DONE.

25:14.469 --> 25:18.299
SHE HAD ENOUGH PILLS
TO KILL HERSELF.AND HOARDING PILLS
IS CHARACTERISTIC

25:18.386 --> 25:23.391
OF THE SUICIDAL TYPE.WHY WOULD SHE KILL HERSELF
WITH THE HYDROGEN CYANIDE?

25:23.478 --> 25:26.960
SHE'D HAD PILLS WHICH WOULD.WELL,
MAYBE SHE WANTED THE PAIN.

25:27.047 --> 25:32.487
SHE NEEDED IT PUNISH HERSELF.YOU REALLY WANT THIS CASE
TO BE OVER, DON'T YOU?

25:32.574 --> 25:35.272
DON'T YOU?ACTUALLY, NO.
I WANT TO FIND OUT THE TRUTH.

25:35.359 --> 25:38.449
AND IF KERRY DIDN'T
KILL HERSELF, THEN--THE WIDOW HAD A MOTIVE.

25:38.537 --> 25:41.844
YEAH, BUT NOT THE TEMPERAMENT.
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'S A KILLER.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.977
THAT LEAVES
ONE OBVIOUS SUSPECT.

25:44.064 --> 25:46.240
OH. [chuckles]

25:46.327 --> 25:48.242
SOPHIE.LOOK AT HER RECORD.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.462
SHE AND ALEX WERE VIOLENTLY
OBSESSED WITH EACH OTHER.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.464
MAYBE THEY WERE
STILL SECRETLY INVOLVED.

25:53.552 --> 25:56.772
MAYBE SHE WAS JEALOUS OF KERRY.WHY KILL KERRY
AND LEAVE EMILY UNHARMED?

25:56.859 --> 25:58.339
[Rigsby]
AND HOW DID SHE KNOW

25:58.426 --> 26:01.995
KERRY WAS SLEEPING WITH ALEX?LET'S GO ASK HER.

26:09.306 --> 26:12.658
LET'S KEEP IT CASUAL.
LET HER RELAX.
IF SHE GETS HER GUARD UP,

26:12.745 --> 26:15.399
WE'LL GET NOTHING FROM HER.YOU'RE COMBATIVE
ALL THE SUDDEN.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.401
[chuckles]
NO, IF SHE IS GUILTY,

26:17.488 --> 26:19.882
SHE LIED TO ME,
AND I BELIEVED IT.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.231
SHE FOOLED ME.

26:21.318 --> 26:22.842
THE ULTIMATE SIN.

26:22.929 --> 26:24.757
YES, IT IS.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.065
[woman]
YOU'RE ADRIFT IN A LIFEBOAT.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.850
YOU CAN SAVE TEN SMALL CHILDREN

26:30.937 --> 26:33.679
BY PUSHING ONE 60-YEAR-OLD MAN OUT OF THE BOAT.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.028
YES OR NO?

26:35.115 --> 26:37.683
NO.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.554
YOU'RE ADRIFT IN A LIFEBOAT.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.600
YOU CAN SAVE TEN SMALL CHILDREN

26:41.687 --> 26:43.993
BY FAILING TO HELP ONE
60-YEAR-OLD MAN

26:44.080 --> 26:46.953
INTO THE BOAT. YES OR NO?

26:47.040 --> 26:48.911
YES.

26:48.998 --> 26:51.348
THAT'S IT. IF YOU COULD
JUST WAIT FOR GREG

26:51.435 --> 26:53.350
TO RELEASE YOU FROM THE CHAIR.

26:53.437 --> 26:55.831
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HELP.

26:55.918 --> 26:58.399
REALLY, BOTH DILEMMAS ARE
EXACTLY THE SAME--

26:58.486 --> 27:00.749
ONE LIFE FOR TEN--

27:00.836 --> 27:03.099
BUT ALMOST EVERYONE ANSWERS
THE SET OF QUESTIONS

27:03.186 --> 27:05.928
THE SAME WAY. IT'S THE MOST
BASIC HUMAN MORALITY--

27:06.015 --> 27:10.716
THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE
AND WHEN WE'RE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE IT. BUT WATCH NOW.

27:10.803 --> 27:14.807
IF I RUN A CURRENT THROUGH
THIS PART OF THE BRAIN,
I CAN PROVOKE A RESPONSE

27:14.894 --> 27:17.548
THAT TOTALLY BYPASSES
ANY CONSCIOUS THOUGHT.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.813
I CAN MANIPULATE THE SUBJECT'S
MORAL REASONING TOWARDS GOOD,

27:20.900 --> 27:23.598
AND IF I WANT, THE REVERSE,
TOWARD EVIL.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.208
NOW YOU KNOW,

27:25.295 --> 27:28.603
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE
COMPLEX ETHICAL ISSUES INVOLVED.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.736
SO WE'VE RECALIBRATED
THE TEST SUBJECTS

27:30.823 --> 27:32.607
JUST ENOUGH
TO PROVE OUR FINDINGS,

27:32.694 --> 27:35.697
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO GET TOO
FAR AHEAD OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT.

27:35.784 --> 27:39.353
THEORETICALLY,
THIS WAY, VILLAINS...[typing]

27:39.440 --> 27:43.531
AND THIS WAY, SAINTS.

27:43.618 --> 27:46.273
YES, IN SIMPLE TERMS.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.580
I MUST HAVE A TRY.
YOU GOTTA LET ME HAVE A TRY.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.930
REALLY?

27:51.017 --> 27:53.628
AS TEST SUBJECT
OR CONTROLLER?

27:53.715 --> 27:56.413
CONTROLLERS? YOU--YOU CALL THEM
CONTROLLERS? THAT'S BRILLIANT.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.198
I'LL DO EITHER.
I'LL DO BOTH.

27:58.285 --> 28:02.202
REALLY? I'M SO GLAD
THAT WE'VE AMUSED YOU.DR. MILLER?

28:02.289 --> 28:06.032
YES?I ASSUME YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT
KERRY SHEEHAN'S DEATH.

28:06.119 --> 28:09.383
YES, IT'S TRAGIC. DO YOU THINK
THAT SHE KILLED ALEX?

28:09.470 --> 28:11.515
IS THERE SOMEWHERE
WE CAN TALK IN PRIVATE?

28:11.602 --> 28:14.083
SOUNDS SO OMINOUS.

28:14.170 --> 28:16.129
WE COULD DO IT DOWNTOWN
WITH LAWYERS PRESENT,

28:16.216 --> 28:18.958
BUT I THOUGHT IT'D BE
MORE CONGENIAL TO TALK HERE.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.003
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M HAPPY TO TALK TO YOU,

28:21.090 --> 28:23.397
'CAUSE I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE
TRYING TO DO YOUR JOB.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.661
WE WERE WONDERING,
DID YOU KNOW KERRY AND ALEX

28:26.748 --> 28:29.446
WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR?I KNEW SHE WAS HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

28:29.533 --> 28:33.624
BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ALEX.

28:33.712 --> 28:38.020
SHE TOLD YOU THAT.
YOU WERE CLOSE, THEN?NO, NOT REALLY.

28:38.107 --> 28:40.327
SHE HAD TO HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE ALEX'S EX.

28:40.414 --> 28:44.418
WHY WOULD SHE TALK TO YOU,
OF ALL PEOPLE?

28:44.505 --> 28:46.376
I DON'T KNOW.

28:46.463 --> 28:48.335
YOU'RE A PSYCHIATRIST.
GIVE IT A SHOT.

28:48.422 --> 28:51.686
MY GUESS IS THAT
SHE WAS A SILLY LITTLE GIRL

28:51.773 --> 28:55.516
WHO LIKED THE SECRET DRAMA
AND THE SAFETY OF THE RULES
THAT WOULD PREVENT ME

28:55.603 --> 28:59.912
FROM SLAPPING HER IF I KNEW.WHY WOULD YOU SLAP HER
FOR THAT?

28:59.999 --> 29:03.611
YOU DIDN'T CARE ANYMORE.I CARED NOTHING AT ALL
FOR HIM,

29:03.698 --> 29:06.962
BUT I DON'T LIKE
BEING PLAYED WITH.WERE YOU STILL INVOLVED

29:07.049 --> 29:10.096
IN A PHYSICAL RELATIONSHIP
WITH HIM?NO.

29:10.183 --> 29:13.621
WHO'S ROSIE?[chimpanzee squeals]

29:13.708 --> 29:17.364
I CAN'T SAY THAT I KNOW
ANYBODY WITH THAT NAME.ARE YOU SURE?

29:17.451 --> 29:20.671
YES. WHY?
WAS THAT ALEX'S OTHER WOMAN?

29:20.759 --> 29:22.804
EMILY HEARD ALEX ARGUING
WITH A WOMAN

29:22.891 --> 29:25.764
SHE THOUGHT
WAS CALLED ROSIE.

29:28.288 --> 29:32.161
LISBON, WOULD YOU LEAVE US ALONE
FOR A MOMENT?

29:32.248 --> 29:33.206
NO PROBLEM.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.253
THANK YOU.

29:39.516 --> 29:40.474
WHAT?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.609
I KNOW YOU'RE
FEELING POWERLESS RIGHT NOW,

29:45.696 --> 29:47.698
BUT YOU'RE IN CONTROL. YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.700
YOU CAN CHOOSE
TO LET EVIL DEFEAT YOU,

29:49.788 --> 29:51.964
OR YOU CAN FIGHT BACK.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.836
YOU CAN FIGHT,
OR YOU CAN GIVE UP AND DIE.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.099
IT'S YOUR CHOICE.

29:59.014 --> 30:01.974
I ASKED LISBON TO LEAVE US
BECAUSE YOU...

30:02.061 --> 30:04.019
GAVE ME MY LIFE BACK,

30:04.106 --> 30:06.935
AND I OWE YOU THE CHANCE
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.459
WHICH IS?TELL ME THE TRUTH.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.027
I TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY WITH THAT NAME.

30:12.114 --> 30:16.684
WHAT ABOUT A MONKEY? DID YOU
KNOW A MONKEY WITH THAT NAME?

30:19.382 --> 30:20.906
YES.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.082
'CAUSE THAT'S...
[raises voice] ROSIE...

30:23.169 --> 30:25.171
[chimpanzee squeals][normal voice]
IN THERE, ISN'T IT?

30:25.258 --> 30:27.826
YES.YOU SWITCHED HER WITH SUSIE

30:27.913 --> 30:31.699
BECAUSE SUSIE NEVER DID
GET GENTLE, DID SHE?NO.

30:31.786 --> 30:34.876
THE MORALITY ENGINE DOESN'T
WORK, DOES IT? IT'S ALL PHOOEY.

30:34.963 --> 30:37.096
AND--AND THIS GUY--
PROFESSOR LEWIS STUTZER--

30:37.183 --> 30:41.317
HE'S THE WIZARD OF OZ.  NO.WE ARE THIS CLOSE.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.580
WE ARE THIS CLOSE
TO CRACKING THIS.

30:43.667 --> 30:47.193
WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF--
OF A REVOLUTIONARY BREAK--"ON THE EDGE"? SOPHIE.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.934
THIS BUILDING,
THIS INSTITUTE,

30:49.021 --> 30:52.372
THIS WHOLE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
PROJECT IS BASED ON A SHAM.

30:52.459 --> 30:55.331
YES OR NO?

30:55.418 --> 30:56.419
YES.

30:56.506 --> 30:59.118
IT'S A SHAM.

30:59.205 --> 31:02.034
WE'VE BEEN FALSIFYING DATA
FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW

31:02.121 --> 31:05.689
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE IT WORKS,
BUT IT DOESN'T.

31:05.776 --> 31:06.908
[sighs]

31:06.995 --> 31:08.170
WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

31:08.257 --> 31:11.870
IT'S--IT WAS...
BOUND TO BE DISCOVERED.

31:14.437 --> 31:17.527
PRIDE,
DELUSION, GREED.

31:17.614 --> 31:22.576
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.
LEWIS STUTZER IS A GENIUS.

31:22.663 --> 31:26.188
THIS PROJECT IS THE CULMINATION
OF HIS LIFE'S WORK.

31:26.275 --> 31:29.017
I SO DESPERATELY
WANTED IT TO WORK.

31:29.104 --> 31:32.803
WE ALL DID.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.936
WE BEGAN BELIEVING THE LIES
WE WERE TELLING.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.330
AND ALEX THREATENED
TO EXPOSE THE WHOLE THING.

31:37.417 --> 31:39.636
HE WAS GOING TO
AT THE SYMPOSIUM THAT MORNING.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.944
HE WAS GONNA CONFESS. I BEGGED
HIM. I BEGGED HIM NOT TO.

31:43.031 --> 31:46.339
IT'D BE THE END OF OUR CAREERS.
IT'D BE THE END OF EVERYTHING.

31:46.426 --> 31:51.213
SO YOU KILLED HIM AND KERRY
TO COVER THIS WHOLE THING UP.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.999
PATRICK. LOOK AT ME.

31:54.086 --> 31:57.828
[emphatically] I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE DEATHS.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.265
I PROMISE.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.311
WHO WAS IT?

32:02.398 --> 32:03.922
STUTZER?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.880
I-I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW.

32:05.967 --> 32:08.143
YOU KNEW THEY WERE KILLED
TO COVER THIS UP,

32:08.230 --> 32:14.062
AND YET YOU DIDN'T SAY
A WORD TO ME.

32:14.149 --> 32:16.238
THAT'S WHY YOU ASKED ME
TO HELP YOU?

32:16.325 --> 32:17.848
SO YOU COULD PUSH MY BUTTONS.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.547
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD MANIPULATE
ME INTO EXONERATING YOU.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.464
SOPHIE, LOOK AT ME.

32:24.551 --> 32:26.857
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE FRAUD,

32:26.945 --> 32:29.512
BUT IF YOU HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THOSE MURDERS--

32:29.599 --> 32:34.387
IF YOU HAD ANYTHING AT ALL
TO DO WITH THOSE MURDERS--

32:34.474 --> 32:36.171
NOW IS THE TIME TO WALK AWAY.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.434
WALK AWAY
AND GET ON A PLANE TO BRAZIL.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.784
PATRICK.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.411
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.

33:00.456 --> 33:02.197
GOOD-BYE.

33:02.284 --> 33:05.287
GOOD-BYE, PATRICK.
BE WELL.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.515
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MURDERS.

33:24.785 --> 33:26.830
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:26.917 --> 33:29.572
I-I DON'T LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT AT ALL.

33:29.659 --> 33:32.619
THAT'S A CRAZY IDEA.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.099
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.

33:34.186 --> 33:36.666
ALL RIGHT.
WILL DO, BOSS. THANKS.

33:36.753 --> 33:38.625
[snaps phone shut]

33:38.712 --> 33:42.542
HE SAID, UH, GO AHEAD.
FINE.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.065
LOVES THE IDEA.

33:46.676 --> 33:47.851
PROFESSOR STUTZER.

33:47.938 --> 33:50.115
WE'VE DONE IT.

33:50.202 --> 33:52.421
WHAT?THE MORALITY ENGINE WORKS.

33:52.508 --> 33:55.729
IT WORKS?I WAS SHOWING THE POLICEMEN
HOW THE BRAIN SCANNER WORKS,

33:55.816 --> 33:57.905
BUT THE SYNCHRONOUS OSCILLATOR
KEPT TRIPPING OFF...

33:57.992 --> 34:01.082
IT'S BEEN DOING THAT.SO I DECIDED TO BYPASS
THE DIFFERENTIAL FILTERS.

34:01.169 --> 34:04.346
I THINK IT'S PRODUCING
AN ION FLOW INTO THE DENDRITE.BUT HOW?

34:04.433 --> 34:06.696
I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS, BUT
IT WORKS.

34:06.783 --> 34:11.092
THIS IS HIS BASELINE
BEFORE RECALIBRATION...[types]

34:11.179 --> 34:13.007
AND AFTER.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.574
YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

34:14.661 --> 34:16.967
I'VE CHECKED AND RECHECKED
THE RESULTS. WATCH.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.058
I'M GONNA OPTIMIZE
HIS MORAL CLARITY.[types]

34:20.145 --> 34:22.103
[woman] QUESTION 65B--

34:22.190 --> 34:24.584
A GUNMAN IS GOING
TO SHOOT AN INNOCENT CHILD

34:24.671 --> 34:27.630
YOU CAN SAVE THE CHILD BY
JUMPING IN FRONT OF THE GUN.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.458
BUT IT WILL
COST YOU YOUR LIFE.

34:29.545 --> 34:34.202
DO YOU "A," GIVE UP YOUR LIFE? OR "B," LET THE CHILD DIE?

34:34.289 --> 34:38.076
"A."NOW I'M GONNA MAKE HIM EVIL.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.903
QUESTION 98--

34:39.990 --> 34:42.341
YOU ARE ON AN ISLAND
WITH A STRANGER

34:42.428 --> 34:46.606
YOU HAVE A FOUND A FOOD SUPPLY ONLY ENOUGH FOR ONE PERSON

34:46.693 --> 34:50.000
IF YOU DON'T SHARE THE FOOD
YOUR SURVIVAL IS GUARANTEED.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.220
AND THE STRANGER WILL STARVE.

34:52.307 --> 34:54.788
DO YOU "A," SHARE THE FOOD,

34:54.875 --> 34:58.531
OR "B,"
KEEP THE FOOD FOR YOURSELF?"B."

34:58.618 --> 35:00.881
SEE? IT WORKS.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.883
IT DOES WORK.

35:02.970 --> 35:04.798
IT REALLY WORKS.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.148
WE MUST TELL THE CHANCELLOR
THAT IT WORKS.

35:09.629 --> 35:12.414
EATING PEOPLE IS WRONG--
TRUE OR FALSE?

35:12.501 --> 35:13.633
FALSE.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.417
QUESTION 95--

35:15.504 --> 35:18.028
SEEING ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
IN PAIN IS PLEASANT--

35:18.116 --> 35:20.988
TRUE OR FALSE?TRUE.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.774
WELL DONE. WELL DONE.
THANK THE LORD!

35:24.861 --> 35:27.429
I-I TOLD YOU
I WOULD SUCCEED IN THE END.

35:27.516 --> 35:32.391
YES, YOU DID.
YOU CERTAINLY DID, DIDN'T YOU?

35:32.478 --> 35:35.785
MR. JANE, I HAVEN'T RESTORED
YOUR NORMAL CALIBRATION.AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.526
BUT HE'S BEEN CALIBRATED
FOR EVIL.

35:37.613 --> 35:39.572
[Lewis] SIR.

35:39.659 --> 35:41.922
SIR, PLEASE,
FOLLOW DR. MILLER'S ADVICE.

35:42.009 --> 35:44.707
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU.OH, YES, I UNDERSTAND.

35:44.794 --> 35:47.275
YOUR MORALITY ENGINE WORKS.
IT MADE ME A GOOD MAN.

35:47.362 --> 35:50.583
NO, YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND.
IT IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.586
NO, DOC,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.762
[keypad beeps]WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:57.938 --> 36:00.854
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

36:00.941 --> 36:04.379
THANK YOU. YOU KNOW WHY
I'M ALIVE ON THIS PLANET?

36:04.466 --> 36:06.816
MY SOLE PURPOSE?

36:06.903 --> 36:09.428
I CATCH BAD PEOPLE
AND PUNISH THEM.

36:09.515 --> 36:11.734
THAT'S ALL I DO,
BECAUSE WHEN I DO THAT,

36:11.821 --> 36:14.389
I KNOW I'M DOING
SOMETHING GOOD, YOU SEE?YES. YES.

36:14.476 --> 36:18.393
GOOD PEOPLE DO GOOD THINGS.
BAD PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS.

36:18.480 --> 36:19.916
TH-THAT--THAT'S TRUE.

36:20.003 --> 36:22.484
NOW LET'S TEST
YOUR MORAL BASELINE.

36:22.571 --> 36:27.185
QUESTION 99--WHO KILLED
ALEX NELSON AND KERRY SHEEHAN?

36:27.272 --> 36:29.535
I-I DON'T KNOW.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.537
THAT'S NOT
AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER.

36:31.624 --> 36:34.931
TELL ME THE TRUTH,
OR I WILL KILL THAT WOMAN.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.107
I AM TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.502
OH, MY GOD! OH, MY GOD!

36:40.589 --> 36:42.939
[Chancellor Stern] OH, MY GOD.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.294
OKAY,
NOW THAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED

36:49.381 --> 36:51.252
SOME REAL TEST PARAMETERS,

36:51.339 --> 36:54.647
TELL ME WHO KILLED ALEX NELSON
AND KERRY SHEEHAN,

36:54.734 --> 36:56.953
OR I WILL SHOOT
YOUR GOOD FRIEND HERE.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.782
AND THEN IF YOU STILL DON'T
GIVE ME AN HONEST ANSWER,

36:59.869 --> 37:03.308
I WILL KILL YOU.I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT I DON'T KNOW.

37:03.395 --> 37:04.744
I NEED AN ANSWER.

37:04.831 --> 37:07.790
IT WAS ME. IT WAS...

37:07.877 --> 37:09.966
IT WAS ME. IT WAS ME.YOU? WHY?

37:10.053 --> 37:12.752
I-I KILLED THEM.
I'M SORRY, LEWIS.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.363
I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

37:15.450 --> 37:17.844
I NEED EVIDENCE.

37:17.931 --> 37:19.367
IN--IN MY BASEMENT

37:19.454 --> 37:21.717

BOTTLE.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.372
WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE?CYANIDE.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.983
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

37:27.070 --> 37:29.986
TO PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY.

37:30.073 --> 37:33.163
ALEX WAS GOING TO EXPOSE
THE STUTZER INSTITUTE

37:33.251 --> 37:34.991
AS A FRAUD.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.168
THE--THE UNIVERSITY'S FINANCES
ARE--ARE BASED

37:38.256 --> 37:40.432
ON STUTZER'S REPUTATION.

37:40.519 --> 37:44.000
IF STUTZER GOES DOWN,
LEYLAND UNIVERSITY GOES DOWN.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.785
KERRY CAME TO YOU
AFTER ALEX DIED,

37:45.872 --> 37:47.961
SAID THAT ALEX
HAD TOLD HER EVERYTHING.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.093
SHE WAS GONNA EXPOSE STUTZER,
AS A FRAUD,

37:50.180 --> 37:53.096
AND AS A MURDERER.YES.

37:53.183 --> 37:58.145
WHERE IN THE BASEMENT IS IT?TOP SHELF ON THE LEFT
AS YOU--AS YOU...

37:58.232 --> 37:59.668
AS YOU COME DOWN THE STAIRS.

37:59.755 --> 38:02.454
I BET YOU KEEP
A NICE, NEAT BASEMENT.

38:02.541 --> 38:06.762
WHAT WAS IN THAT BOTTLE AGAIN?CYANIDE.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.854
SOPHIE, YOU CAN GET UP NOW.

38:11.941 --> 38:13.856
SEE? THE BLOOD--
TOTALLY WORTH IT.

38:13.943 --> 38:16.859
IT'S ALWAYS THOSE LITTLE DETAILS
THAT HELP SELL THE WHOLE THING.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.818
THAT WAS--THAT WAS GREAT.

38:21.124 --> 38:25.041
IT'S ALL INADMISSIBLE.
I-I SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY
TO--TO SAVE MYSELF

38:25.128 --> 38:26.956
FROM THIS LUNATIC WITH A GUN.

38:27.043 --> 38:28.697
IT'S INADMISSIBLE.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.178
SHE KNOWS, BUT KNOWING THE TRUTH
IS IMPORTANT, TOO.

38:31.265 --> 38:36.357
UH, TOP SHELF LEFT OR RIGHT,
DID YOU SAY?LEFT.

38:36.444 --> 38:39.186
WE HAVE AGENTS AT YOUR HOUSE
WITH A SEARCH WARRANT.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.796
INADMISSIBLE.

38:40.883 --> 38:44.234
YES. I'D HATE
TO BE A STATE'S ATTORNEY.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.280
JANE'S ALWAYS PULLING CRAP
LIKE THIS ON THEM.

38:46.367 --> 38:48.413
BUT THEY ALWAYS WIN.
IN THE MEANTIME,

38:48.500 --> 38:52.330
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
CHO? WOULD YOU?PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.897
THANK YOU.[Cho] YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.

38:54.984 --> 38:58.205
ANYTHING YOU SAY
WILL BE HELD AGAINST YOU
IN A COURT OF LAW.

38:58.292 --> 39:00.773
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY
DURING QUESTIONING.

39:00.860 --> 39:05.778
IF YOU GIVE UP THAT RIGHT...THE ENGINE DOESN'T WORK?

39:05.865 --> 39:08.607
HUH.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.479
YOU WERE PRETENDING.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.438
[whispers] IT DOESN'T WORK.

39:13.525 --> 39:16.223
PRETENDING.

39:16.310 --> 39:19.226
TO CATCH THE CHANCELLOR...
OR ME, I SUPPOSE.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.010
YOU COULDN'T KNOW WHICH.

39:21.097 --> 39:22.838
NO, I THOUGHT IT WAS YOU.

39:24.318 --> 39:27.669
VERY CLEVER.

39:27.756 --> 39:31.978
I SO BADLY WANTED TO BELIEVE
THAT IT WORKED.

39:32.065 --> 39:35.373
MIND PLAYS TRICKS, HUH?

39:35.460 --> 39:39.159
[inhales sharply] WELL...

39:39.246 --> 39:41.944
NEVER MIND.

39:47.123 --> 39:50.605
IN THE FUTURE,
I HOPE THAT YOUR LOVE LIFE
IS A LITTLE MORE PEACEFUL,

39:50.692 --> 39:54.522
BUT IF IT'S NOT AND AN EX-LOVER
TURNS UP DEAD AGAIN,

39:54.609 --> 39:56.742
DO ME A FAVOR?
DON'T CALL ME.

39:56.829 --> 40:00.093
I THINK
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH EVEN.

40:00.180 --> 40:04.010
PAID IN FULL.GREAT.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.229
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

40:06.316 --> 40:09.581
I'M RUINED AS A SCIENTIST,

40:09.668 --> 40:12.627
SO I'LL PROBABLY GO BACK
TO HELPING PEOPLE ONE BY ONE.

40:12.714 --> 40:15.978
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
YOU'RE VERY GOOD AT THAT.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.980
THANKS.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.907
BYE, SOPHIE. BE WELL.

40:43.223 --> 40:47.096
AW.
JANE KISSED A GIRL.

40:47.183 --> 40:48.924
WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S...

40:49.011 --> 40:50.883
YEAH, ON THE CHEEK.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.712
STILL COUNTS.

40:53.799 --> 40:54.756
COUNTS AS WHAT?

40:54.843 --> 40:56.845
NOTHING. JUST SAYING.

41:13.819 --> 41:17.213
YOU WANT TO DRIVE?

41:17.300 --> 41:18.911
THAT'S A VERY SWEET OFFER.

41:18.998 --> 41:21.261
DO I REALLY SEEM SO SAD?

41:21.348 --> 41:24.743
WHAT? I WAS JUST ASKING
IF YOU WANTED TO DRIVE.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.701
YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
YOU DESPISE IT.

41:26.788 --> 41:29.965
YOU DRIVE WAY TOO FAST.I DRIVE JUST FAST ENOUGH.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.011
YOU HATE NOT BEING
THE ONE IN CONTROL,

41:32.098 --> 41:34.230
AND YOU'RE WILLING TO
OVERCOME YOUR IRRATIONAL FEARS

41:34.317 --> 41:37.451

A BEAUTIFUL THING, LISBON.
