WOULD FIT RIGHT IN.

15:07.816 --> 15:08.684
>> YEAH.

15:08.684 --> 15:12.555
>> RIGHT.

15:12.555 --> 15:14.857
>> HI!

15:14.857 --> 15:17.393
>> HOW IS EVERYBODY DOING?

15:17.393 --> 15:18.260
>> CAN I COME THIS WAY?

15:18.260 --> 15:19.061
>> GIVE YOU A HUG.

15:19.061 --> 15:19.795
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

15:19.795 --> 15:22.364
>> GOOD, GOOD.

15:22.364 --> 15:24.166
>> THIS IS THE LAST PIECE IN

15:24.166 --> 15:25.334
THIS RELATIONSHIP, WHERE I NEED

15:25.334 --> 15:28.003
MY FAMILY'S APPROVAL.

15:28.003 --> 15:29.838
THEY HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT

15:29.838 --> 15:31.574
RED FLAGS IN THE PAST WITH

15:31.574 --> 15:33.375
PEOPLE THAT I'VE DATED, LIKE,

15:33.375 --> 15:34.376
ESPECIALLY MY MOM.

15:34.376 --> 15:36.078
THEY SOMETIMES SEE THINGS THAT I

15:36.078 --> 15:37.880
DON'T PICK UP ON, AND SO I

15:37.880 --> 15:38.514
REALLY HOPE EVERYTHING GOES WELL

15:38.514 --> 15:42.351
TODAY.

15:42.351 --> 15:42.985
>> SO!

15:42.985 --> 15:44.053
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:44.053 --> 15:44.820
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

15:44.820 --> 15:45.387
>> I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

15:45.387 --> 15:47.289
I'M FEELING REALLY GOOD.

15:47.289 --> 15:49.491
THIS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING,

15:49.491 --> 15:51.860
AMAZING JOURNEY, YOU KNOW, AND,

15:51.860 --> 15:55.998
YOU KNOW, JUST ALL OF THIS,

15:55.998 --> 15:58.167
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF NEW FEELINGS

15:58.167 --> 16:01.570
THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FELT BEFORE.

16:01.570 --> 16:02.638
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY I'M HERE,

16:02.638 --> 16:03.239
I GUESS IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO

16:03.239 --> 16:03.405
SAY.

16:03.405 --> 16:05.307
[LAUGHTER]

16:05.307 --> 16:08.744
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY I'M HERE.

16:08.744 --> 16:10.879
>> BUT, YEAH, AFTER HOMETOWN

16:10.879 --> 16:12.815
DAY, NAYTE SHARED THAT HE WAS

16:12.815 --> 16:14.450
FALLING IN LOVE.

16:14.450 --> 16:15.918
>> YEAH.

16:15.918 --> 16:18.220
>> YOU DID?

16:18.220 --> 16:19.888
>> AND THEN, DO YOU WANT TO

16:19.888 --> 16:20.389
CARRY ON THE NEXT PART?

16:20.389 --> 16:21.557
>> YEAH.

16:21.557 --> 16:23.892
THAT WAS HUGE FOR ME.

16:23.892 --> 16:25.027
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT WASN'T

16:25.027 --> 16:25.561
SOMETHING I'VE EXPERIENCED

16:25.561 --> 16:26.528
BEFORE.

16:26.528 --> 16:27.930
THAT WAS, LIKE, THE FIRST

16:27.930 --> 16:28.797
RECOGNITION OF "OKAY, NAYTE,

16:28.797 --> 16:29.732
THIS IS SOMETHING REALLY

16:29.732 --> 16:31.667
SERIOUS," SO.

16:31.667 --> 16:34.803
>> WE'VE JUST KIND OF HAD A

16:34.803 --> 16:36.138
RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS NOT SLOWED

16:36.138 --> 16:40.276
DOWN WHATSOEVER.

16:40.276 --> 16:41.510
YEAH.

16:41.510 --> 16:42.578
>> LOOK AT US NOW.

16:42.578 --> 16:44.580
[LAUGHS]

16:44.580 --> 16:45.881
>> NAYTE, SHOULD WE GO TALK?

16:45.881 --> 16:49.251
>> YEAH, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

16:49.251 --> 16:51.520
>> WITH NAYTE, THERE WAS A

16:51.520 --> 16:52.688
DIFFERENT VIBE THAN WHAT WE SAW

16:52.688 --> 16:55.057
WITH BRANDON.

16:55.057 --> 16:56.892
BRANDON WAS DEFINITELY A WARMER

16:56.892 --> 16:59.328
PERSON, INITIALLY.

16:59.328 --> 17:00.396
>> SO, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

17:00.396 --> 17:05.434
MICHELLE?

17:05.434 --> 17:06.902
I CAN SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, SEE

17:06.902 --> 17:08.737
SHE HAS THESE FEELINGS FOR YOU,

17:08.737 --> 17:10.105
AND I JUST HOPE THAT THEY ARE

17:10.105 --> 17:10.706
THE SAME.

17:10.706 --> 17:11.573
YOU KNOW, IN REVERSE.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.808
>> DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.

17:12.808 --> 17:13.642
FEELINGS ARE BEING RECIPROCATED,

17:13.642 --> 17:14.176
FOR SURE, DEFINITELY.

17:14.176 --> 17:15.244
MUTUAL FEELINGS.

17:15.244 --> 17:16.712
I DEFINITELY WANT TO GET DOWN ON

17:16.712 --> 17:17.946
ONE KNEE.

17:17.946 --> 17:21.717
NOW, THE LOGISTICS OF, YOU KNOW,

17:21.717 --> 17:23.552
WHERE ARE WE MOVING, ARE YOU

17:23.552 --> 17:24.820
COMING HERE, AM I COMING THERE,

17:24.820 --> 17:26.055
ARE WE GOING ELSEWHERE, YOU

17:26.055 --> 17:28.657
KNOW, THE ACTUAL LOGISTICS OF

17:28.657 --> 17:29.958
EVERYTHING, I DON'T KNOW.

17:29.958 --> 17:30.793
>> OKAY.

17:30.793 --> 17:34.096
INTERESTING.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.565
NOW, MICHELLE HAS LOTS OF

17:36.565 --> 17:38.233
AMBITIONS, AND SHE WANTS TO STAY

17:38.233 --> 17:41.704
IN MINNESOTA.

17:41.704 --> 17:42.738
>> YEAH.

17:42.738 --> 17:44.173
>> THIS IS, YOU KNOW, WHERE SHE

17:44.173 --> 17:44.840
WANTS TO LIVE HER LIFE.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.075
>> YEAH.

17:46.075 --> 17:48.077
>> NAYTE WAS VAGUE ABOUT MOVING

17:48.077 --> 17:49.678
TO MINNESOTA, SO IT KIND OF

17:49.678 --> 17:52.448
RAISED A CONCERN.

17:52.448 --> 17:54.717
WHEN YOU MAKE A PROPOSAL TO

17:54.717 --> 17:58.087
SOMEONE TO MARRY THEM, YOU WANT

17:58.087 --> 17:59.621
TO LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE THE

17:59.621 --> 18:00.589
REST OF YOUR LIFE WITH THAT

18:00.589 --> 18:01.790
PERSON.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.927
>> ARE YOU GOING TO MOVE TO

18:04.927 --> 18:05.461
MINNESOTA IF SHE ASKS YOU?

18:05.461 --> 18:06.095
I'M ASSUMING YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT

18:06.095 --> 18:06.628
THIS.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.097
>> HER AND I DEFINITELY HAD THAT

18:08.097 --> 18:10.199
CONVERSATION ABOUT MOVING.

18:10.199 --> 18:11.567
THE THING ABOUT ME IS THAT I AM

18:11.567 --> 18:12.868
ALL ABOUT THE ADVENTURE, AND,

18:12.868 --> 18:13.769
I MEAN, I HAVE MOVED SO MANY

18:13.769 --> 18:15.104
TIMES IN MY LIFE.

18:15.104 --> 18:15.971
>> OKAY, SO MAYBE MOVING IS

18:15.971 --> 18:16.972
EASY.

18:16.972 --> 18:19.441
>> MOVING IS VERY EASY ‐‐

18:19.441 --> 18:20.976
>> WHAT ABOUT STAYING STILL AND

18:20.976 --> 18:23.579
BEING CONTENT?

18:23.579 --> 18:25.214
>> UM, I GUESS I HAVEN'T GIVEN

18:25.214 --> 18:28.250
THAT TOO MUCH THOUGHT.

18:28.250 --> 18:31.153
YOU KNOW, MICHELLE AND I HAVE A

18:31.153 --> 18:32.821
LIST OF ALL THE ADVENTURES WE

18:32.821 --> 18:34.089
WANT TO GO ON, SO THERE'S A HUGE

18:34.089 --> 18:34.790
ADVENTURE THEME GOING ON IN OUR

18:34.790 --> 18:35.958
RELATIONSHIP ‐‐

18:35.958 --> 18:37.726
>> THAT'S GREAT, AND THAT'S

18:37.726 --> 18:39.128
REALLY GRANDIOSE, TO TRAVEL AND

18:39.128 --> 18:41.196
TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS, BUT THEY

18:41.196 --> 18:41.830
CAN BE A DISTRACTION TO WHAT

18:41.830 --> 18:42.798
YOUR RELATIONSHIP IS REALLY

18:42.798 --> 18:47.669
ABOUT.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.138
>> HAS HE INDICATED "I WANT TO

18:49.138 --> 18:50.572
GET MARRIED RIGHT AWAY"?

18:50.572 --> 18:53.575
>> I DON'T KNOW.

18:53.575 --> 18:55.544
BUT WE HAD THE CONVERSATION OF

18:55.544 --> 18:56.278
"WOULD HE BE READY FOR AN

18:56.278 --> 18:57.312
ENGAGEMENT?"

18:57.312 --> 18:58.680
HIS RESPONSE WAS YES.

18:58.680 --> 19:01.250
100% YES.

19:01.250 --> 19:03.452
>> I'M HOPING THAT NAYTE HAS THE

19:03.452 --> 19:05.454
QUALITIES THAT MICHELLE HAS SEEN

19:05.454 --> 19:07.823
THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN.

19:07.823 --> 19:10.592
SHE'S THE ETERNAL OPTIMIST.

19:10.592 --> 19:11.393
SHE'S ALWAYS THINKING OF WHAT

19:11.393 --> 19:13.929
CAN GO RIGHT.

19:13.929 --> 19:17.699
AND NOT WHAT CAN GO WRONG.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.333
>> SO, YOU'VE NOT BEEN IN LOVE

19:18.333 --> 19:18.567
BEFORE.

19:18.567 --> 19:22.671
>> YEAH.

19:22.671 --> 19:23.605
WHEN YOU ‐‐ LIKE BY DEFINITION

19:23.605 --> 19:24.273
OF HOLLYWOOD FILMS OR KIND OF

19:24.273 --> 19:25.574
WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT BEING IN

19:25.574 --> 19:26.275
LOVE, I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER

19:26.275 --> 19:28.677
EXPERIENCED THAT BEFORE.

19:28.677 --> 19:30.712
BUT I TRUST MYSELF, WHEN I LOOK

19:30.712 --> 19:32.147
INTO MICHELLE'S EYES WHEN I TELL

19:32.147 --> 19:33.682
HER THAT I LOVE HER, YOU KNOW,

19:33.682 --> 19:34.883
THAT I'M FALLING IN LOVE WITH

19:34.883 --> 19:36.251
YOU, LIKE, I TRUST THAT.

19:36.251 --> 19:37.219
>> SO DO YOU FEEL LIKE SHE'S THE

19:37.219 --> 19:38.287
ONE?

19:38.287 --> 19:39.421
DO YOU FEEL LIKE SHE'S THE ONE

19:39.421 --> 19:40.889
FOR YOU?

19:40.889 --> 19:45.093
>> I MOST DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE,

19:45.093 --> 19:46.528
YOU KNOW, IF IT'S, YOU KNOW,

19:46.528 --> 19:49.998
SAYING "THE ONE FOR ME," LIKE,

19:49.998 --> 19:51.767
THOSE KIND OF CLICHE SAYINGS,

19:51.767 --> 19:53.001
WHAT I FEEL IS THAT MY MIND AND

19:53.001 --> 19:54.136
MY HEART ARE POINTING DIRECTLY

19:54.136 --> 19:56.805
AT MICHELLE, AND I DEFINITELY

19:56.805 --> 19:57.573
DON'T TAKE LOVE SERIOUS ‐‐ I

19:57.573 --> 19:58.440
DEFINITELY DON'T TAKE LOVE FOR

19:58.440 --> 19:59.475
GRANTED ‐‐

19:59.475 --> 20:00.742
>> DON'T TAKE IT SERIOUSLY, HUH?

20:00.742 --> 20:01.610
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

20:01.610 --> 20:02.678
[LAUGHTER]

20:02.678 --> 20:05.547
GOING DOWNHILL RIGHT NOW.

20:05.547 --> 20:06.181
>> I DEFINITELY DON'T TAKE LOVE

20:06.181 --> 20:06.515
FOR GRANTED.

20:06.515 --> 20:08.617
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A GAME TO ME

20:08.617 --> 20:09.117
TO SAY WORDS LIKE THAT.

20:09.117 --> 20:10.819
>> I ‐‐ I BELIEVE YOU.

20:10.819 --> 20:12.488
I MEAN, I'M STILL NOT SURE THAT

20:12.488 --> 20:13.922
AT THE END OF THIS, YOU REALLY

20:13.922 --> 20:14.556
FEEL LIKE YOU'D BE READY FOR AN

20:14.556 --> 20:16.892
ENGAGEMENT.

20:16.892 --> 20:17.493
>> OH, HOPEFULLY I HAVEN'T

20:17.493 --> 20:18.894
PORTRAYED THAT.

20:18.894 --> 20:19.495
>> NO, HONESTLY, THAT'S HOW I

20:19.495 --> 20:20.762
FEEL.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.531
I FEEL LIKE YOU FEEL REAL

20:22.531 --> 20:24.566
RESERVED AND, LIKE, I'M NOT

20:24.566 --> 20:25.767
SURE THAT ‐‐ I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE

20:25.767 --> 20:26.468
100% IN.

20:26.468 --> 20:27.236
>> NO, I AM DEFINITELY IN.

20:27.236 --> 20:29.271
>> OKAY.

20:29.271 --> 20:32.007
>> AT THE END OF THIS, IF, YOU

20:32.007 --> 20:35.644
KNOW, MICHELLE DOES CHOOSE ME, I

20:35.644 --> 20:36.578
AM VERY READY TO GET DOWN ON ONE

20:36.578 --> 20:36.912
KNEE.

20:36.912 --> 20:38.280
>> ARE YOU?

20:38.280 --> 20:38.981
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SHE

20:38.981 --> 20:42.518
DOESN'T CHOOSE YOU?

20:42.518 --> 20:46.455
>> UM, I'VE BEEN TRYING JUST NOT

20:46.455 --> 20:49.191
TO THINK ABOUT A NEGATIVE, UH,

20:49.191 --> 20:50.926
FINISH TO ALL OF THIS.

20:50.926 --> 20:54.363
>> BUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

20:54.363 --> 20:55.130
DON'T YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH

20:55.130 --> 20:55.697
SIDES, KIND OF?

20:55.697 --> 20:56.798
>> YEAH, NO, IT'S DEFINITELY A

20:56.798 --> 20:58.767
POSSIBILITY, AND...

20:58.767 --> 20:59.935
THAT WOULDN'T BE FUN.

20:59.935 --> 21:00.936
THAT WOULDN'T BE FUN.

21:00.936 --> 21:02.604
>> RIGHT.

21:02.604 --> 21:04.039
YOU'RE NOT REAL OPEN WITH YOUR

21:04.039 --> 21:06.074
EMOTIONS, I DON'T FEEL.

21:06.074 --> 21:07.042
YOU'RE SAYING THEM, BUT I'M NOT

21:07.042 --> 21:07.476
QUITE FEELING THEM.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.777
>> FEELING THEM.

21:08.777 --> 21:10.012
>> YOU KNOW, NAYTE WAS VERY

21:10.012 --> 21:11.480
KIND, HE SAID ALL THE RIGHT

21:11.480 --> 21:13.415
THINGS, BUT I REALLY WASN'T

21:13.415 --> 21:15.317
GETTING THAT FEELING THAT, THAT

21:15.317 --> 21:16.451
HE WAS READY, FOR SURE, TO

21:16.451 --> 21:18.687
PROPOSE TO HER.

21:18.687 --> 21:19.955
>> I THINK SHE'S REALLY FEELING

21:19.955 --> 21:21.823
A LOT FOR YOU.

21:21.823 --> 21:23.559
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

21:23.559 --> 21:24.226
THAT YOU'RE FEELING IT FOR HER,

21:24.226 --> 21:24.626
TOO.

21:24.626 --> 21:26.395
>> THAT IT'S GENUINE, YEAH.

21:26.395 --> 21:28.130
>> I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS SHE

21:28.130 --> 21:29.331
LIKES ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE'S A

21:29.331 --> 21:30.032
LITTLE MORE SURPRISING, MAYBE A

21:30.032 --> 21:32.200
LITTLE LESS PREDICTABLE.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.368
TO BE HONEST, I AM WORRIED ABOUT

21:33.368 --> 21:34.803
THAT.

21:34.803 --> 21:35.604
>> I JUST HOPE YOU'RE NOT GOING

21:35.604 --> 21:37.139
TO HURT HER.

21:37.139 --> 21:38.840
I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO SHOW THAT

21:38.840 --> 21:41.176
SAME FEELING BACK TO HER.

21:41.176 --> 21:44.179
>> IT REALLY WOULD BE JUST

21:44.179 --> 21:46.014
HEARTBREAKING IF THIS ENDED

21:46.014 --> 21:47.416
WITHOUT AN ENGAGEMENT, IF THE

21:47.416 --> 21:48.984
PERSON SHE CHOSE, THINKING

21:48.984 --> 21:49.818
THEY'RE READY, AND THEN THEY'RE

21:49.818 --> 21:50.986
NOT.

21:50.986 --> 21:57.326
THAT WOULD NOT BE A GOOD ENDING.

1:19:55.441 --> 1:19:56.875
I'M CERTAIN ABOUT THIS.

1:19:56.875 --> 1:19:57.710
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS CERTAIN

1:19:57.710 --> 1:19:58.978
BEFORE.

1:19:58.978 --> 1:20:00.980
MY HEART AND MY MIND ARE

1:20:00.980 --> 1:20:01.880
COMPLETELY IN SYNC FOR THE FIRST

1:20:01.880 --> 1:20:04.750
TIME IN MY LIFE.

1:20:04.750 --> 1:20:06.318
AND I AM SO CLOSE TO ACTUALLY

1:20:06.318 --> 1:20:06.952
HAVING THE BEST‐CASE SCENARIO BE

1:20:06.952 --> 1:20:08.921
REALIZED.

1:20:08.921 --> 1:20:10.522
THIS COULD BE THE FIRST DAY OF

1:20:10.522 --> 1:20:16.028
THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER.

1:20:16.028 --> 1:20:16.495

1:20:31.910 --> 1:20:37.516
MICHELLE.

1:20:37.516 --> 1:20:41.687
THE VERY FIRST NIGHT I MET YOU,

1:20:41.687 --> 1:20:43.622
I KNEW RIGHT THEN AND THERE THAT

1:20:43.622 --> 1:20:45.758
WE HAD A CONNECTION THAT I

1:20:45.758 --> 1:20:50.929
WANTED TO HOLD ONTO.

1:20:50.929 --> 1:20:52.364
THE SECOND NIGHT THAT WE WERE

1:20:52.364 --> 1:20:53.132
TOGETHER, WE TALKED ABOUT

1:20:53.132 --> 1:20:54.433
RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER.

1:20:54.433 --> 1:20:55.701
AND I'M STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU

1:20:55.701 --> 1:20:56.769
RIGHT NOW, AND THE FEELINGS ARE

1:20:56.769 --> 1:20:57.870
THE SAME.

1:20:57.870 --> 1:21:01.407
I WANT TO RUN AWAY WITH YOU.

1:21:01.407 --> 1:21:04.076
I WANT TO RUN AWAY TO FOREVER

1:21:04.076 --> 1:21:05.310
WITH THE WOMAN THAT I'VE COME TO

1:21:05.310 --> 1:21:10.182
LOVE.

1:21:10.182 --> 1:21:11.016

1:21:11.016 --> 1:21:18.557

1:21:18.557 --> 1:21:20.025
AND THROUGH THIS JOURNEY, YOU'VE

1:21:20.025 --> 1:21:23.295
SHARED A LOT OF VULNERABLE SIDES

1:21:23.295 --> 1:21:25.297
OF YOUR PAST, AND I KNOW THAT

1:21:25.297 --> 1:21:28.000
YOU'VE FELT UNSEEN AT TIMES, AND

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:32.037
I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM

1:21:32.037 --> 1:21:35.641
COMPLETELY PREPARED, WILLING,

1:21:35.641 --> 1:21:39.211
AND READY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU

1:21:39.211 --> 1:21:43.248
ARE ALWAYS CHOSEN FIRST, SEEN,

1:21:43.248 --> 1:21:46.919
NOW, TODAY, TOMORROW, AND FOR

1:21:46.919 --> 1:21:51.290
THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

1:21:51.290 --> 1:22:00.666
I LOVE YOU, MICHELLE.

1:22:00.666 --> 1:22:03.836
>> NAYTE.

1:22:03.836 --> 1:22:06.805
FROM THE MOMENT YOU STEPPED OUT

1:22:06.805 --> 1:22:07.940
OF THE LIMO, I FELT THAT THERE

1:22:07.940 --> 1:22:11.677
WAS A CONNECTION.

1:22:11.677 --> 1:22:13.979
IT WAS THIS KINETIC MOMENT WHERE

1:22:13.979 --> 1:22:16.482
I WAS FEELING THINGS THAT I

1:22:16.482 --> 1:22:18.884
DIDN'T EVEN REALLY KNOW IT WAS

1:22:18.884 --> 1:22:21.787
POSSIBLE TO FEEL, BUT WALKING

1:22:21.787 --> 1:22:25.124
INTO THIS, MY FEAR WAS THAT I

1:22:25.124 --> 1:22:29.928
WOULD NOT BE LOVED AS MUCH AS I

1:22:29.928 --> 1:22:33.765
LOVE THE OTHER PERSON.

1:22:33.765 --> 1:22:36.135
AND THROUGH OUR CONVERSATIONS,

1:22:36.135 --> 1:22:38.403
THERE WERE MOMENTS WHERE THAT

1:22:38.403 --> 1:22:39.571
FEAR DEFINITELY STARTED TO CREEP

1:22:39.571 --> 1:22:44.443
IN.

1:22:44.443 --> 1:22:45.544
AND THIS HAS NOT NECESSARILY

1:22:45.544 --> 1:23:05.297
BEEN A SMOOTH RIDE.

1:23:05.297 --> 1:23:10.536
BUT...

1:23:10.536 --> 1:23:14.339
I'M ALSO NOT WILLING TO FACE

1:23:14.339 --> 1:23:15.941
THAT FEAR OF WALKING AWAY FROM

1:23:15.941 --> 1:23:20.879
THIS WITHOUT YOU.

1:23:20.879 --> 1:23:23.448
BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER FELT A LOVE

1:23:23.448 --> 1:23:26.919
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

1:23:26.919 --> 1:23:28.020
AND I LOVE YOU WITH MY ENTIRE

1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:32.090
HEART.

1:23:32.090 --> 1:23:34.193

1:23:34.193 --> 1:23:37.863
ABOUT WAKING UP NEXT TO ANYONE

1:23:37.863 --> 1:23:39.231

1:23:39.231 --> 1:23:43.635
ANYONE BESIDES YOU.

1:23:43.635 --> 1:23:45.971

STANDING IN FRONT OF MY

1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:49.875
