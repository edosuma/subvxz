Who remembers?

36:00.762 --> 36:02.345
But don't sweat Michaela.

36:02.345 --> 36:04.512
We got a barracuda to fry.

36:05.512 --> 36:07.261
Yeah.

36:07.261 --> 36:09.261
You want to take a guess

36:09.261 --> 36:12.136
how many murders there were
in Roxbury this year?

36:12.136 --> 36:14.470
-Gun murders?
-Not a clue.

36:14.470 --> 36:16.220
No humans involved, right?

36:16.220 --> 36:19.220
-That's low, even for me.
-You know, I, uh--

36:19.220 --> 36:22.220
I looked up the facts
after we arrested the gasman.

36:23.512 --> 36:26.095
Forty-five dead on the year.

36:26.095 --> 36:30.929
Most young, male, black.

36:30.929 --> 36:33.261
All I could think was,

36:33.261 --> 36:35.845
any of those 45 dead
black kids

36:35.845 --> 36:37.470
could have been me.

36:37.470 --> 36:40.095
I'd just be another
statistic.

36:40.095 --> 36:42.220
Shit, I am a statistic.

36:42.220 --> 36:46.970
I'm the one lone black
male prosecutor

36:46.970 --> 36:50.178
in a Suffolk County
DA's office.

36:50.178 --> 36:52.345
And I'm sitting here
working triple overtime

36:52.345 --> 36:54.637
to find the killers
of three white guards.

37:01.053 --> 37:03.011
You know, I was reading
this thing about Lincoln.

37:03.011 --> 37:06.845
You know, everybody thinks of
him like as this idealistic god.

37:06.845 --> 37:09.762
but the truth is is that Abe
was a master politician,

37:09.762 --> 37:12.303
He was like Roosevelt,
but without the money.

37:12.303 --> 37:14.095
He knew how to work
the levers,

37:14.095 --> 37:16.762
how to reward those
that did what he wanted,

37:16.762 --> 37:18.470
and punish those
that didn't.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.887
The rest of it,

37:20.887 --> 37:23.720
eh, it's just a story
we tell ourselves.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.512
Yeah?

37:25.512 --> 37:28.512
You know, last night I said
the same thing to Siobhan.

37:29.970 --> 37:32.595
No one's wholly innocent.

37:32.595 --> 37:33.845
Hmm.

37:33.845 --> 37:35.387
Or wholly guilty.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.929
At least I hope not.

37:36.929 --> 37:40.220
Otherwise, I won't be
well remembered.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.762
You had to mention Lincoln,
though?

37:41.762 --> 37:43.053
Literally I just
read that.

37:46.762 --> 37:48.845
This is going
to be an adventure.

37:48.845 --> 37:49.970
You ready?

37:51.428 --> 37:52.720
-[sighs]
-[water sloshes]

37:52.720 --> 37:53.970
-Dad!
-Yeah?

37:53.970 --> 37:55.595
The water's still cold.

37:55.595 --> 37:57.720
Oh, yeah?
You can't handle the cold?

37:57.720 --> 37:58.929
You sit in the tub.

38:00.136 --> 38:01.470
[sighs]

38:02.679 --> 38:05.637
I did when I was your age.

38:05.637 --> 38:07.970
Your uncle and I
wanted to be frogmen

38:07.970 --> 38:10.345
more than anything else
in the entire world.

38:10.345 --> 38:13.970
We'd take cold baths and see who
could stay in there the longest.

38:13.970 --> 38:15.637
I could be a frogman.

38:15.637 --> 38:17.804
Yeah. Absolutely,
you could.

38:22.970 --> 38:25.345
It's not going to be
like this forever.

38:25.345 --> 38:29.345
[man and woman
arguing indistinctly]

38:33.011 --> 38:34.845
[door squeaks open]

38:34.845 --> 38:37.470
You know last time
I was in Roxbury?

38:37.470 --> 38:39.553
Not now. I'm sick.

38:39.553 --> 38:42.220
What, these other shitbags
don't take care of you?

38:42.220 --> 38:43.595
There's no honor
anymore.

38:43.595 --> 38:44.845
[gasps]

38:44.845 --> 38:46.720
I'm going to go
into fucking shock.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.762
I figured this might
be the case.

38:48.762 --> 38:49.970
[groans]

38:49.970 --> 38:51.762
[pills rattle]

38:51.762 --> 38:53.387
Leonard Jensen.

38:53.387 --> 38:54.845
Where does he store
the guns?

38:54.845 --> 38:56.887
No, Jackie, seriously,
I'm going to die.

38:56.887 --> 38:58.887
Then, please,
let me help you.

38:58.887 --> 39:02.345
I tell you about the guns, I'm--
I'm done. I'm no good to you.

39:02.345 --> 39:05.178
I. Don't. Care.

39:05.178 --> 39:06.679
W-Well, that--
that's it?

39:06.679 --> 39:08.929
That's-- that's all
my loyalty gets me?

39:08.929 --> 39:09.887
Okay.

39:09.887 --> 39:12.261
[sniffles]
After.

39:12.261 --> 39:13.887
Help me and I'll talk,

39:13.887 --> 39:15.387
and after I'll--
I'll-- I'll be done.

39:16.887 --> 39:18.387
For your troubles.

39:20.387 --> 39:22.887
Actually, last time
I was in Roxbury

39:22.887 --> 39:24.428
was a couple of years ago.

39:24.428 --> 39:26.387
I took my daughter
to the zoo.

39:26.387 --> 39:28.720
Yeah, and this black bastard
comes up to me,

39:28.720 --> 39:30.887
sticks a zip gun
right in my side,

39:30.887 --> 39:32.387
asks for my shoes.

39:32.387 --> 39:34.595
Gucci loafers.
Brand-new.

39:34.595 --> 39:36.095
And my daughter,
I don't want her to see this.

39:36.095 --> 39:38.428
She's over there
watching the monkeys, right?

39:38.428 --> 39:40.929
So I take off the shoes
and I give them to the guy.

39:40.929 --> 39:43.428
Later, she notices
and she says to me,

39:43.428 --> 39:46.220
"Dad, what happened
to your shoes?"

39:46.220 --> 39:47.929
I told her the monkeys
took 'em.

39:47.929 --> 39:50.011
[laughs]

39:50.011 --> 39:51.595
Made her day.

39:52.929 --> 39:54.428
[sighs]

39:56.470 --> 39:58.387
So where does Jensen
store the guns?

39:58.387 --> 39:59.845
[sighs]

40:01.553 --> 40:02.929
Know what, Jack?

40:04.887 --> 40:06.929
Fuck you.

40:06.929 --> 40:08.387
-Hmm.
-[laughs]

40:10.762 --> 40:12.095
[sighs]

40:20.553 --> 40:23.762
[sneezing, gagging]

40:28.929 --> 40:30.804
[sniffles]

40:30.804 --> 40:32.679
Do you think I'm fucking
stupid?

40:32.679 --> 40:34.261
Oh! What was that?

40:34.261 --> 40:35.762
Nothing that'll kill you.

40:35.762 --> 40:37.720
Just weaker
than you need.

40:41.178 --> 40:43.261
I won't ask you again,
you fuck.

40:43.261 --> 40:45.095
[sighs and sniffles]

40:45.095 --> 40:46.470
Jackie, these--

40:46.470 --> 40:48.679
These niggers won't just
blow my brains out.

40:48.679 --> 40:52.470
So you want a chance to run?
I'm offering you one.

40:52.470 --> 40:54.303
But you play games,
and I'm going to leave you here.

40:54.303 --> 40:55.762
And if you survive the night,

40:55.762 --> 40:57.679
I'm gonna throw your ass
in Walpole.

40:57.679 --> 41:00.011
You think you'll do
okay in there? Huh?

41:00.011 --> 41:01.929
All on your own?

41:01.929 --> 41:05.345
So af-af-after everything,
you cut me loose?

41:05.345 --> 41:07.428
What are we, friends?

41:07.428 --> 41:08.512
Uh...

41:08.512 --> 41:09.762
[sniffles]

41:09.762 --> 41:10.970
Apar--
[clears throat]

41:10.970 --> 41:14.011
Apartment 317, Building 4.

41:15.679 --> 41:16.762
Okay.

41:18.470 --> 41:19.845
I need more.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.512
So do I.

41:21.512 --> 41:23.345
Keep talking.

41:25.553 --> 41:27.679
[Bill Clinton, on TV]
I debate Jerry's tax,

41:27.679 --> 41:29.762
because I agree with the
New York Daily News columnist

41:29.762 --> 41:31.428
who said it was the biggest
rip-off of working people

41:31.428 --> 41:33.512
in the history
of American politics.

41:33.512 --> 41:35.553
-It was a terrible idea, but...
-[audience applauds]

41:35.553 --> 41:37.929
Oh, are you a Jerry Brown man,
Decourcy?

41:39.595 --> 41:41.970
The only one talking about
taking money from the rich,

41:41.970 --> 41:43.428
so, yeah.

41:43.428 --> 41:44.845
Not because
he wants to put

41:44.845 --> 41:46.595
Reverend Jesse Jackson
on the ticket?

41:46.595 --> 41:48.929
I'm not the biggest fan
of reverends at the moment.

41:48.929 --> 41:50.136
And why is that?

41:50.136 --> 41:53.053
-He means Fields.
-What?

41:53.053 --> 41:55.136
Why?

41:55.136 --> 41:56.553
-What happened?
-[sighs]

41:56.553 --> 41:58.637
Women are
accusing him.

41:58.637 --> 42:00.053
And you
believe them?

42:00.053 --> 42:02.387
Yeah, Mom, I do.
He came onto me.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.095
[man]
Wait, what happened?

42:04.095 --> 42:05.553
[Siobhan]
I handled him fine.

42:05.553 --> 42:08.095
[man]
No. Siobhan, what did he do?

42:08.095 --> 42:10.720
What I went through is nothing
compared to the other women.

42:11.887 --> 42:13.929
Well, this accusation
hurts all of us.

42:13.929 --> 42:15.428
You don't think he should
take responsibility

42:15.428 --> 42:17.136
for what he's done?

42:17.136 --> 42:19.303
There are things you have to do
sometimes for the cause.

42:19.303 --> 42:22.679
[Siobhan] So I should preserve
his reputation for the greater
good?

42:22.679 --> 42:24.470
Close my eyes, lie,
for the greater good?

42:24.470 --> 42:26.345
Fields isn't perfect.
Are you?

42:28.345 --> 42:30.053
-Are you?
-That's not the problem.

42:30.053 --> 42:32.095
What's the problem,
Decourcy?

42:32.095 --> 42:33.762
The problem is that
we marginalize ourselves

42:33.762 --> 42:35.720
every time we bring the subject
back to race.

42:35.720 --> 42:38.762
The coalition's not about race.
It's about justice.

42:38.762 --> 42:40.637
Y-You make race the problem

42:40.637 --> 42:43.261
and not something
that's more inclusive,

42:43.261 --> 42:46.220
then we'll always
be defined as black.

42:46.220 --> 42:48.220
All right?
So for the cause,

42:48.220 --> 42:50.303
hey, all due respect,

42:50.303 --> 42:51.929
it's not the same battle.

42:51.929 --> 42:53.929
You have no idea
what I've been through.

42:53.929 --> 42:55.553
You think things
are bad now?

42:55.553 --> 42:57.095
When the Civil Rights Movement
was fully--

42:57.095 --> 42:58.887
There we go.

42:58.887 --> 43:00.762
Yeah, that's right.
Here I go.

43:04.053 --> 43:05.178
Mom...

43:05.178 --> 43:07.345
[sighs]
Well, there are debates,

43:07.345 --> 43:09.762
-and there are debates.
-Mom, wait a minute.

43:11.053 --> 43:12.428
[door opens]

43:14.595 --> 43:15.679
Bye.

43:19.178 --> 43:20.387
[door closes]

43:20.387 --> 43:21.345
I thought you'd learn by now

43:21.345 --> 43:22.762
how to speak
to my mother.

43:24.804 --> 43:26.929
Well, since we're
asking questions,

43:26.929 --> 43:29.804
were you ever going to tell me
about what Fields did to you?

43:30.970 --> 43:33.470
He didn't do anything.

43:33.470 --> 43:35.303
Just paid too much attention,

43:35.303 --> 43:37.053
made an inappropriate comment.

43:37.053 --> 43:41.136
The other day,
you said I earned your trust.

43:41.136 --> 43:43.804
-Yes.
-What else don't you tell me?

43:43.804 --> 43:45.762
Excuse me?

43:47.762 --> 43:49.470
No, you know...

43:49.470 --> 43:52.136
you got another part
of your life, that's fine.

43:52.136 --> 43:54.303
That's fine.
I understand.

44:16.970 --> 44:18.887
Why are you up this late?

44:18.887 --> 44:20.845
Why are you?

44:20.845 --> 44:23.679
Found the rat at the apartment
where the guns are being stored.

44:23.679 --> 44:26.512
Bromley Heath, Building 4,
Apartment 317.

44:26.512 --> 44:29.178
Well, I'll get the warrant.

44:29.178 --> 44:30.595
Yeah, and get your boss to agree

44:30.595 --> 44:32.136
and we'll go to town
on these bastards.

44:32.136 --> 44:34.178

44:34.178 --> 44:36.136
Hey, can I ask you something?

44:36.136 --> 44:37.470
Yeah, sure.

44:37.470 --> 44:40.553
Do you ever get tired
of the shit?

44:40.553 --> 44:42.303
You ever read Macbeth?

44:42.303 --> 44:44.178
I'm so far in,

44:44.178 --> 44:46.845
it would take just as long
to turn back.

Hank Signa's organizing
a raid at dawn.

45:06.387 --> 45:10.220
I was you, I'd bring in
the Youth Violence Strike Force,

45:10.220 --> 45:12.303
BPD, they, uh--

45:12.303 --> 45:15.220
they organize this group
to, uh-- to deal with the gangs.

45:15.220 --> 45:16.929
And they could
use a break.

45:16.929 --> 45:19.011
Well, these guys can be
a part of the bust

45:19.011 --> 45:21.387
as long as they understand the
state troopers call the shots.

45:21.387 --> 45:24.845
Yeah, you're going to like
these Strike Force guys. Okay?

45:24.845 --> 45:26.095
-Yeah?
-Yeah, yeah.

45:26.095 --> 45:27.595
They're just like you.

They want to change the world.
