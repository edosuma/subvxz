WEBVTT

00:09.467 --> 00:11.386
Jimmy, it's Lois. Again.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.179
I'm so sorry
for standing you up,

00:13.179 --> 00:15.807
which was completely
Clark's fault.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.600
I'm on my way to the campsite.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.601
I'll see you there.

00:21.521 --> 00:23.148
Uh...

00:23.148 --> 00:25.400
Oh, I... I didn't realize...

00:25.400 --> 00:27.569
Lois... Lois, I...

00:27.569 --> 00:29.612
Uh, Jimmy
isn't answering my calls.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.865
He's not answering
yours either...

00:31.865 --> 00:33.908
Maybe...

00:33.908 --> 00:35.577
Maybe because
you stood him up.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.370
It's more than that.
I flew to the campground.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.372
No, Jimmy.
I flew over the forest,

00:39.372 --> 00:40.915
the Daily Planet. Nothing.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.543
Lois, he's just gone.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.420
- He...
- Disappeared.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.214
Just like everyone who came
into contact with that tech.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.260
I know you're mad at me
but this isn't about us.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.929
Something has happened
to Jimmy.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.015
You're the best investigator
I know.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.641
And I can't find him
without you.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.518
Please.

01:01.978 --> 01:03.480
Hmm.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.606
Thank you.

01:06.107 --> 01:07.317
Let's get one thing straight.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.569
I'm doing this
for Jimmy not you.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.155
And we could be overreacting.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.491
<i>Maybe he just turned
off his phone.</i>

01:14.491 --> 01:17.285
What?

01:18.661 --> 01:19.746
Hello?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.872
Why am I strapped
to a...

01:55.990 --> 01:58.326
Lois, hold on for a second.

01:58.326 --> 01:59.369
These are Jimmy's size.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.914
Uh, he was walking,
not running.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.457
This way.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.754
So...

02:09.754 --> 02:12.257
Uh, how do you know
how to track people
through the woods?

02:12.257 --> 02:13.383
Wilderness weekends.

02:15.301 --> 02:18.721
Dad took me on wilderness
survival weekends as a kid.

02:18.721 --> 02:20.306
He taught me how to use
a compass,

02:20.306 --> 02:23.226
find a path, purify water,
set bones...

02:23.226 --> 02:24.561
You know, et cetera, et cetera.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.397
That sounds intense.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.565
I didn't know that about you.

02:29.232 --> 02:30.483
Yeah, well,

02:30.483 --> 02:32.610
there's a lot about me
you're never gonna know.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.573
Great going, Kent.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.700
Lois, wait. I'm sorry.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.369
Huh?

02:48.710 --> 02:52.088
I scouted the forest
from the air at least
a dozen times.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.132
How did I miss this?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.178
Jimmy!

03:03.016 --> 03:03.892
Lois.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.697
Clark!

03:25.204 --> 03:26.039
Hmm.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.542
I found Jimmy's phone.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.669
<i>This is the moment, birdwatchers.</i>

03:31.669 --> 03:33.379
<i>Tonight we find...</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:34.964
<i>What's that?</i>

03:36.925 --> 03:38.343
<i>Did you hear that?</i>

03:38.343 --> 03:40.803
Is it a...

03:40.803 --> 03:42.347
Oh, my gosh.

03:42.347 --> 03:43.473
Bigfoot kidnapped Jimmy.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.269
I've been kidnapped
by Bigfoot!

03:49.395 --> 03:50.772
And some other guy.

03:50.772 --> 03:55.276
We are Monsieur Mallah
and the Brain, trespasser.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.487
And those are the last words

03:57.487 --> 04:00.865
your spying ears
will ever hear!

04:00.865 --> 04:02.825
Mallah, the lasers.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.118
On it, <i>mon amour.</i>

04:06.871 --> 04:10.875
Any last words, spy,
before we end your life?

04:11.542 --> 04:12.460
Yes.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.047
Thank you.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.007
Uh...

04:18.007 --> 04:20.009
This isn't how I thought
it would end but at least

04:20.009 --> 04:22.971
I got to meet
a super-intelligent
French gorilla before I died.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.349
Which means I was right
about everything!

04:26.349 --> 04:30.353
Too bad my so-called "friends"
will never know.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.022
So go ahead and open my brain.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.441
At least someone cares
what I think.

04:40.446 --> 04:43.282
You seem troubled
by something.

04:43.282 --> 04:45.493
Would you like
to talk about it?

04:46.452 --> 04:47.662
What?

04:49.789 --> 04:50.665
Ugh!

04:57.255 --> 04:58.089
Lois...

04:59.716 --> 05:01.342
What the...

05:01.342 --> 05:03.302
It looks like
an army invaded...

05:04.554 --> 05:06.556
and then melted.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.765
What is this place?

05:08.349 --> 05:09.684
Cadmus.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.477
I've heard that name before.

05:11.477 --> 05:13.021
<i>Disavowed by the government,</i>

05:13.021 --> 05:15.231
<i>who knows what horrors Cadmus,</i>

05:15.231 --> 05:18.818
<i>aka Area 52, still contains.</i>

05:18.818 --> 05:21.112
<i>UFOs, alien technology?</i>

05:21.112 --> 05:23.072
"Alien technology."

05:23.072 --> 05:24.741
Pull up the next video.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.326
<i>Birdwatchers, get ready to meet
tomorrow's special guest.</i>

05:27.326 --> 05:30.246
<i>Now, these two were late
to get on the Bird-Train</i>

05:30.246 --> 05:32.248
<i>but they are without a doubt,</i>

05:32.248 --> 05:35.001
<i>the most important people
in my life.</i>

05:35.001 --> 05:37.587
<i>So join me and my best friends</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:39.172
<i>as we unearth</i>

05:39.172 --> 05:42.425
<i>the secrets of Sasquatch...
quatch... quatch...</i>

05:44.844 --> 05:46.262
Clark,

05:46.262 --> 05:49.640
when Jimmy told you
all his theories about aliens,

05:49.640 --> 05:50.600
did you...

05:51.559 --> 05:52.935
I mean, does he know?

05:52.935 --> 05:54.228
- About, you?
- No.

05:55.229 --> 05:56.731
How come you never told him?

05:56.731 --> 05:58.649
Let's just keep going, okay?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.613
No. I'm tired of you
not answering my questions.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.032
I don't wanna talk
about this right now.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.118
Then when? When is a good time
for the truth with you?

06:09.118 --> 06:11.162
Lois, I've told you more
about myself

06:11.162 --> 06:12.914
than I've ever told anyone.

06:12.914 --> 06:15.625
You already know I'm Superman.
What else do you need to know?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.835
Did you lie
about your feelings for me?

06:20.171 --> 06:21.589
Everything you said to me...

06:22.840 --> 06:24.634
was it all just a cover
for you?

06:25.718 --> 06:27.553
Lois...

06:27.553 --> 06:29.055
How could you think that?

06:35.561 --> 06:36.729
Lois...

06:40.858 --> 06:42.068
Run!

06:48.199 --> 06:49.033
<i>Voila!</i>

06:49.033 --> 06:50.993
And welcome to Cadmus.

06:50.993 --> 06:51.953
Whoa!

06:58.251 --> 07:00.837
For the record,
I am against this.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.214
Is that
the Loch Ness Monster?

07:03.214 --> 07:07.301
It's one of the mutants
we lost in Scotland. Yes.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.513
No, way! Are those...

07:13.891 --> 07:16.352
The CIA's classified
Sonic Guns under development

07:16.352 --> 07:18.521
until the creator
mysteriously vanished.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.273
<i>Mai oui.</i>

07:20.273 --> 07:22.733
Also, the Creator
didn't vanish.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.026
We recruited her.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.696
I can't believe
I'm touching one.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.197
Have you guys seen my phone?

07:28.197 --> 07:29.365
Phone?

07:29.365 --> 07:32.368
You wish to expose
our existence?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.204
I'm just trying
to show the world
how amazing this all is.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.875
And prove how right I am
to two people specifically.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.751
People
you brought with you?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.170
Brain, for the love of...

07:42.170 --> 07:44.255
Would you stop
threatening our guest?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.423
Prisoner!

07:45.423 --> 07:47.717
And why are we
giving him a tour?

07:47.717 --> 07:50.511
He'll lead others here
to destroy us, my love.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.388
Aw, <i>mon amour.</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:55.057
Must you always assume
the worst?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.226
For decades,
we have been alone.

07:57.226 --> 08:01.397
No one to talk to, let alone
admire our work.

08:01.397 --> 08:05.359
Perhaps the world
is more accepting now, huh?

08:05.359 --> 08:10.239
Perhaps things,
won't be like last time.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.866
What do you mean,
"Like last time?"

08:11.866 --> 08:14.702
No.
No, don't tell him any...

08:14.702 --> 08:18.331
Twenty two years ago,
we belong to Cadmus.

08:18.331 --> 08:22.251
<i>The U.S. government's
top-secret science agency.</i>

08:22.251 --> 08:25.504
<i>We, along with military
division Task Force X,</i>

08:25.504 --> 08:29.091
<i>were given strange technology
by the government.</i>

08:29.091 --> 08:31.385
<i>Our orders were
to make weapons.</i>

08:31.385 --> 08:35.306
<i>But while our sister program
relished the charge,</i>

08:35.306 --> 08:38.726
<i>we were not interested
in destruction.</i>

08:38.726 --> 08:42.605
<i>We used the technology
to create.</i>

08:42.605 --> 08:46.442
<i>After an experiment gave me
super intelligence,</i>

08:46.442 --> 08:51.113
<i>I began to work
with another young scientist,</i>

08:51.113 --> 08:54.533
<i>which bloomed
into a wonderful partnership.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:59.747
<i>We were men of science
stepping into the unknown.</i>

09:00.706 --> 09:02.625
<i>But when it was discovered</i>

09:02.625 --> 09:07.463
<i>that we were making things
to change the world,
not harm it,</i>

09:07.463 --> 09:10.800
<i>Task Force X was sent
to eliminate us.</i>

09:11.634 --> 09:13.010
<i>But in their attack,</i>

09:13.010 --> 09:16.347
<i>they disturbed
our most fragile experiment,</i>

09:16.347 --> 09:19.183
<i>an unstable black hole!</i>

09:19.183 --> 09:22.979
<i>Task Force X assumed
there were no survivors
and moved on.</i>

09:24.021 --> 09:25.481
<i>Brain lost his body.</i>

09:27.692 --> 09:30.236
But his mind
and his art remained.

09:30.236 --> 09:35.157
And so I can spend my life
with the man I love most
in all the universe.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.452
Wow.

09:38.452 --> 09:41.455
You know, your story
and mine are kinda similar.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.958
Were you also hunted?

09:43.958 --> 09:47.044
Close. My friends stood me up
for a camping trip.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.506
Okay, your story has
more kill squads

09:50.506 --> 09:53.217
but I know how it feels
to be abandoned

09:53.217 --> 09:55.803
by people who are supposed
to support you.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.973
My friends
don't take my work seriously.

09:58.973 --> 10:00.641
They don't take me seriously.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.271
I know little in this world.

10:05.271 --> 10:08.316
But if someone cares for you,

10:08.316 --> 10:10.943
they want to know how you feel.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.946
You just need
to speak your mind.

10:13.946 --> 10:17.783
And if they still reject you,
you can stay with us.

10:17.783 --> 10:20.703
What? <i>Nein!</i>
We must eliminate him.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.539
Oh, that is your answer
to everything.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.458
Eliminates this, kill that,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.293
leave the dishes
until they get mold,

10:27.293 --> 10:29.962
then claim it's some sort
of experiment.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.672
- It is an experiment!
- I, um...

10:31.672 --> 10:33.632
- need to use the bathroom.
- You just don't want to clean.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.552
You don't see mold
as a part of life.

10:36.552 --> 10:38.304
It is a phylum!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.348
<i>When we run
out of penicillin,</i>

10:40.348 --> 10:43.559
<i>don't come crying to me saying,
"Brain, we are out
of penicillin."</i>

10:57.239 --> 10:58.991
Keep running.

11:03.120 --> 11:03.954
What?

11:15.424 --> 11:16.258
Clark!

11:19.178 --> 11:20.179
Hang on.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.810
Hold tight.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.606
Clark!

11:30.606 --> 11:31.941
I'm sorry. Something's wrong
with my powers.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.652
They're...
They're weaker somehow.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.239
Clark, run!

11:53.712 --> 11:55.339
They're not following.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.424
We're in the clear.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.972
Lois!

12:14.483 --> 12:15.317
Clark!

12:17.903 --> 12:18.904
Are you all right?

12:19.905 --> 12:21.574
I'm fine. But, Clark...

12:22.450 --> 12:23.325
I'm okay.

12:24.243 --> 12:26.120
Everything's okay.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.581
How did you know
you'd be bulletproof?

12:28.581 --> 12:32.668
I didn't. I just knew
that you weren't.

12:32.668 --> 12:36.005
Yeah, let's find Jimmy
and get out of here before
something else happens.

12:40.426 --> 12:44.346
Is this the unstable
black hole that destroyed
everything?

12:44.346 --> 12:45.681
Of course, not.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.683
This is a new one.

12:47.683 --> 12:49.226
Why would you make a new one?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.645
Well, you see,

12:51.645 --> 12:54.440
<i>we may have
deliberately blown it up</i>

12:54.440 --> 12:55.900
<i>to fake our deaths and escape.</i>

12:58.319 --> 13:03.991
But since then, we have lived
a simple life of peace.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.660
When we figure out
how to stabilize it,

13:06.660 --> 13:08.537
it will become a wormhole.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.457
A gateway to other dimensions.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.168
Dimensions where
we might be welcome.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.086
Not feared.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.047
Ohh,
unless it blows up first.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.216
That's not something
to be excited about!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.926
Ah, fear not, Jimmy.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.888
As long as nothing disrupts
the flow of power to this room,

13:25.888 --> 13:27.556
it's perfectly safe.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.016
Huh?

13:40.611 --> 13:41.987
We need to be careful.

13:41.987 --> 13:42.988
Who knows what could be...

13:44.240 --> 13:46.575
I told you
he'd lead enemies to us!

13:50.538 --> 13:52.957
Everyone stop!

13:52.957 --> 13:55.251
You know
these intruders, Jimmy?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.963
Yeah. These are the "friends"
I was telling you about.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.382
Oh.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.425
- The bad ones.
- Mmm.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.262
What? What?
No. No. We're, um...

14:06.262 --> 14:08.514
I mean, yes,
we did forget about camping.

14:08.514 --> 14:11.433
Mmm <i>. Oui. D'accord.</i>

14:11.433 --> 14:13.018
We will give you space.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.063
Mallah, I want
to watch them fight.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.233
Jimmy,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.110
we are...

14:21.110 --> 14:22.653
so sorry that we let you down.

14:22.653 --> 14:23.571
I...

14:24.154 --> 14:25.823
am sorry.

14:25.823 --> 14:29.159
This whole situation today
has made me realize
that I... I...

14:29.159 --> 14:32.496
I held things back from you
and I shouldn't have.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.749
Jimmy, you deserve to know.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.877
I am...

14:38.877 --> 14:41.880
Clark. I know you're Superman.
This is not a big reveal.

14:44.008 --> 14:44.883
Wait. What?

14:44.883 --> 14:46.927
You know, since when?

14:46.927 --> 14:48.762
We've been roommates
since freshman year.

14:48.762 --> 14:51.140
The day I met you,
you ripped the handle
off the door,

14:51.140 --> 14:53.851
then tried to play it
like the screws
had just come loose.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.146
I mean, it could have
been the screws.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.481
The handle
was ripped in half!

14:59.481 --> 15:03.319
I didn't say anything
because it seemed like
a sensitive subject.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.280
So I thought that if I waited,

15:06.280 --> 15:07.823
you would tell me
when you were ready.

15:07.823 --> 15:11.201
You've known
this whole time?

15:11.201 --> 15:12.828
Why didn't you tell me?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.663
Hold up!

15:14.663 --> 15:17.166
You told Lois
before you told me?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.667
Your best friend?

15:18.667 --> 15:20.794
Okay, it's been
a weird 24 hours.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.631
My powers aren't working
and we've been chased
all over this place by robots.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.508
So let's just take
a deep breath and stop yelling.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.053
<i>Uh, robots?</i>

15:30.346 --> 15:32.097
<i>What robots?</i>

15:32.097 --> 15:34.516
What happened
to giving us space?

15:34.516 --> 15:37.519
<i>Forgive me, Jimmy,
I love drama.</i>

15:37.519 --> 15:41.357
<i>But Cadmus never created
any robots.</i>

15:41.357 --> 15:43.901
<i>If you are being chased
by something,</i>

15:43.901 --> 15:46.111
<i>it is not one of ours.</i>

15:56.580 --> 15:59.541
The OMACS.
They are from Task Force X.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.502
The original kill squad!

16:06.423 --> 16:08.592
Something must have
awakened them.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.635
Allow us!

16:21.689 --> 16:23.774
And who are they?

16:25.317 --> 16:27.403
So we got bored hiding,

16:27.403 --> 16:30.906
<i>like, one year in and made
a bunch of mutants, okay?</i>

16:30.906 --> 16:33.784
But other than
creating a black hole

16:33.784 --> 16:35.786
and an army of mutants,

16:35.786 --> 16:37.454
we live a simple life of peace.

16:37.454 --> 16:39.415
Uh, mostly.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.003
The containment field.
Fall back!

16:48.674 --> 16:50.467
Why is there a black hole?

16:52.344 --> 16:54.138
Ask the mad scientists.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.306
Genius is never
appreciated its own time.

17:05.232 --> 17:09.194
We need to access
the control panel
and turn on the backup systems.

17:10.195 --> 17:11.613
Tell me what to do.

17:11.613 --> 17:15.784
Set the frequency ratio
to .1778.

17:17.494 --> 17:19.621
It's 1887.

17:19.621 --> 17:21.707
You always transpose
your numbers.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.251
- Then what?
- Keep entering
those numbers

17:24.251 --> 17:26.712
until it works or we die!

17:27.796 --> 17:28.756
<i>Mein Liebchen!</i>

17:37.598 --> 17:39.475
Before we die, I gotta know,

17:39.475 --> 17:42.644
why did you cut me
out of a huge part
of your life?

17:42.644 --> 17:45.647
- And me?
- Because I was scared!

17:45.647 --> 17:47.483
All I've ever wanted
is to be normal.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.151
I don't want you to treat me
like an alien.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.736
I just wanna be your friend.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.238
Clark...

17:54.990 --> 17:56.784
We don't care "what" you are.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.994
We're friends
because of "who" you are.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.164
And we just want you
to be open with us.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.999
Open... That's it!

18:07.669 --> 18:09.671
What are you doing?

18:09.671 --> 18:11.924
We need to open
the containment field

18:11.924 --> 18:16.804
and let the black hole
hit critical mass
for it to stabilize.

18:29.733 --> 18:30.776
Hold on.

19:04.184 --> 19:05.727
We must leave.

19:05.727 --> 19:09.106
The red-sun-omega-field
that was keeping Cadmus hidden

19:09.106 --> 19:12.109
is no longer
operational. But...

19:12.109 --> 19:13.819
I will miss you, Jimmy.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.948
So, The General found you yet?

19:17.948 --> 19:19.449
How... How did you...

19:19.449 --> 19:23.287
The OMACS woke up after you
entered our parameter.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.956
The omega field affected you.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.750
The tech reacts to you.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.587
I don't know what they gave
us 22 years ago but...

19:31.587 --> 19:34.882
you are somehow caught
in the middle of it.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.968
And if you are,

19:37.968 --> 19:40.846
then you're in the crosshairs
of Task Force X.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.890
- Of him.
- Who is he?

19:42.890 --> 19:46.018
A man who would blot out
the sun

19:46.018 --> 19:49.229
if he thought his country
demanded it.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.773
<i>The one we've been
hiding from.</i>

19:51.773 --> 19:54.109
<i>Because once he sees you
as a threat,</i>

19:56.111 --> 19:58.363
he will never, ever stop.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.907
Come with us.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.658
You are different.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.785
Strange, like us.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.455
And this world,

20:07.873 --> 20:09.708
it's not so forgiving of that.

20:09.708 --> 20:10.959
I have to stay.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.586
I have to believe
this world can be a place

20:12.586 --> 20:14.338
where everyone's
accepted and...

20:15.339 --> 20:16.840
I need to help it get there.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.426
With the people I love.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.263
Then until we meet again.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.891
<i>Auf Wiederschen,</i> Clark Kent.

20:25.891 --> 20:28.936
And now we must take our leave.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.980
If you come back,
we're doing an interview
for Flamebird.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.273
And the Daily Planet.

20:33.273 --> 20:36.318
I think we'd need
some pictures, though.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.321
Perry might take some
convincing to become
a true believer.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.156
Like us.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.464
Ready to step
into the unknown,
<i>mein Liebchen?</i>

20:57.464 --> 20:59.091
Always, <i>mon amour.</i>

21:10.602 --> 21:12.646
<i>Sir, we finished
scouting the area.</i>

21:12.646 --> 21:14.398
<i>No sign of the old tech
that pinged us.</i>

21:14.398 --> 21:16.650
<i>But we found clear signs
of recent habitation.</i>

21:17.985 --> 21:18.860
<i>Over.</i>

21:19.987 --> 21:20.821
Hmm.

21:22.406 --> 21:24.992
This is nostalgic for me.

21:24.992 --> 21:27.577
My first operation.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.038
The first hard call
I had to make

21:31.540 --> 21:34.793
I want your opinion
on the tech here.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.671
Put that brilliant mind
of yours to work.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.842
But why would a humble,
kidnapped billionaire
like me do that?

21:41.842 --> 21:43.552
Because
we want the same thing.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.138
To take down Superman.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.724
To rip him from the sky

21:48.724 --> 21:52.728
and to bury him so deep
the world won't even
remember his name.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.273
Yeah, no.
In that case, I can work
with all of this.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.152
When do we start?
