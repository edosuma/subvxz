00:00.773 --> 00:02.225
Previously on "Quantico"...

00:02.250 --> 00:04.097
Shelby, I was
trying to protect you. I...

00:04.098 --> 00:06.673
Why would you write these lies?
Mr. Haas, it's about my parents.

00:06.708 --> 00:08.775
And I need you to help me bring them

00:08.810 --> 00:10.909
and their crimes to justice.

00:10.943 --> 00:12.244
I figured you
might be missing home,

00:12.279 --> 00:13.879
so I got some orange flower water.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.715
D.C.

00:16.751 --> 00:20.218
I start in two
weeks... Or should I say, "We do"?

00:21.455 --> 00:22.588
There's a flash drive.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.757
It'll decrypt Ryan's computer passwords.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.072
What the hell did you do?

00:26.182 --> 00:27.558
What was on that flash drive?

00:27.594 --> 00:30.127
A manifesto
implicating Ryan as the terrorist.

00:30.162 --> 00:31.328
That's Ryan's truck.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.764
You have more instructions,

00:32.799 --> 00:33.831
and if you don't follow them,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.707
I'll kill Simon and
set the nuke off right now.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.212 --> 00:49.479
Stay on First Ave. Until
you hit 51st Street.

00:49.515 --> 00:51.481
How do you know where I'm headed?

00:51.517 --> 00:53.683
The truck's GPS is wired to my tablet.

00:53.719 --> 00:56.486
If you deviate from the
course, the bomb is set to detonate,

00:56.522 --> 00:58.321
and I'm watching you.

01:01.826 --> 01:05.828
Drew, just listen to me, okay?

01:05.863 --> 01:07.830
Let's just talk.

01:07.865 --> 01:09.865
You and me.

01:09.901 --> 01:11.233
Unh-unh-unh.

01:11.268 --> 01:12.835
I may not have graduated Quantico,

01:12.870 --> 01:14.870
but I know what you're trying to do.

01:14.906 --> 01:16.806
First rule of a crisis situation...

01:16.841 --> 01:18.807
establish a connection.

01:18.842 --> 01:21.676
Yeah, you always could read me.

01:21.711 --> 01:24.312
You know, after you left,

01:24.347 --> 01:26.915
I thought maybe we
could meet again and...

01:26.950 --> 01:28.683
Reconnect?

01:28.718 --> 01:29.851
Get dinner?

01:29.886 --> 01:31.486
See if you could ruin my life again?

01:31.521 --> 01:32.921
I know you're angry.

01:32.956 --> 01:35.823
This is not gonna solve anything.

01:37.225 --> 01:39.392
I'm sorry, but you made your choice.

01:39.428 --> 01:41.394
Left on 51st.

01:41.430 --> 01:43.931
Whatever your plan is, wherever
you're taking me,

01:43.966 --> 01:45.332
you're not gonna be
able to get away with it.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.868
Ryan, Miranda,
Nimah... Everyone saw everything.

01:47.903 --> 01:50.938
The FBI's probably
tracking me as we speak.

01:50.973 --> 01:52.071
I'm counting on it.

01:52.106 --> 01:55.508
I caught Alex uploading these
files to my computer.

01:55.543 --> 01:56.442
I tried to subdue her, but I...

01:56.478 --> 01:58.177
These are schematics for a nuclear bomb.

01:58.212 --> 02:00.947
Miranda. You need to see this.

02:00.982 --> 02:03.015
What?

02:03.050 --> 02:04.750
Alex said there was a
nuclear bomb out there.

02:04.786 --> 02:06.853
Miranda, look.

02:08.788 --> 02:10.589
Ma'am.

02:10.624 --> 02:12.457
CCTV footage of the parking garage

02:12.493 --> 02:14.726
just before Parrish escaped.

02:14.761 --> 02:15.627
Okay, people.

02:15.662 --> 02:18.630
I'm initiating WMD
containment protocols.

02:18.665 --> 02:20.765
Get me Director Haskins and
Deputy Director O'Connor.

02:20.801 --> 02:22.367
Now, please!

02:22.402 --> 02:23.902
Frain, get on the horn with NYPD

02:23.937 --> 02:25.936
and alert them to
possible citywide evac.

02:25.972 --> 02:27.237
I need NSA, DOE, and FEMA.

02:27.272 --> 02:30.875
Today is not the day a nuclear
bomb goes off in New York City.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.886
Amin, escort Agent
Booth to holding, please.

02:32.911 --> 02:33.545
What?

02:33.579 --> 02:34.745
You're throwing me in there with Caleb?

02:34.780 --> 02:37.581
I just got done telling
you Alex is trying to frame me.

02:37.617 --> 02:38.777
And the bomb is in your truck,

02:38.784 --> 02:39.984
and the plans are on your computer.

02:40.019 --> 02:41.986
Until I know what the hell is going on,

02:42.021 --> 02:44.320
you are a person of
interest in this investigation.

02:44.355 --> 02:47.089
Amin, do it.

02:52.964 --> 02:55.932
In one week, your
training will be complete.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.501
It may have taken almost 140 days,

02:58.537 --> 03:01.637
but we have broken you
down and built you back up.

03:01.672 --> 03:03.872
You've come a long way since
you first got here.

03:03.908 --> 03:06.041
I never gave this back to you.

03:06.076 --> 03:09.044
Top of your class.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.546
Your father would be proud.

03:10.581 --> 03:12.514
Now, I'm not sure if that's a comfort.

03:12.550 --> 03:14.750
Or a curse?

03:14.785 --> 03:16.018
I don't know, myself.

03:16.053 --> 03:18.085
I know you and I had a rocky start.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.888
I wasn't sure you had the
right intentions of coming here,

03:20.924 --> 03:22.256
but you proved me wrong,

03:22.291 --> 03:24.725
and I would be honored

03:24.761 --> 03:27.327
to work with you in the field someday.

03:27.363 --> 03:29.530
You all came here strangers,

03:29.566 --> 03:33.000
but you've forged a deeper
trust and an inner strength.

03:33.902 --> 03:35.702
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

03:35.737 --> 03:37.904
O'Connor offered to
take me with him to D.C.

03:37.940 --> 03:40.707
Can't
break you two up, can you?

03:40.742 --> 03:44.110
Well, it's a big promotion,
and there are other benefits.

03:44.145 --> 03:46.012
D.C.'s only three
hours by train from New York,

03:46.048 --> 03:47.080
where you're going.

03:47.115 --> 03:48.548
Great.

03:50.952 --> 03:52.084
I hope you take it, then.

03:53.788 --> 03:58.256
And you're going to need
it, especially in the beginning.

04:00.127 --> 04:03.228
Field office
assignments... finally.

04:04.832 --> 04:07.966
Held up pending my security clearance.

04:08.001 --> 04:08.933
Of course.

04:08.969 --> 04:12.136
Why did they even
bother graduating me, anyway?

04:12.171 --> 04:14.072
Shelby?

04:14.107 --> 04:15.940
What'd you get... Tampa?

04:18.845 --> 04:20.978
Hey. I got sunny San Diego.

04:21.014 --> 04:23.147
- What'd you get?
- You're sick.

04:23.182 --> 04:24.482
"I'm sorry we haven't been in touch,

04:24.517 --> 04:26.750
but circumstances beyond our control..."

04:26.785 --> 04:28.785
I told you to stop, and I meant it.

04:28.821 --> 04:30.921
One more of these, I will report you.

04:33.025 --> 04:36.026
I didn't write this.

04:38.097 --> 04:41.231
Those first few
months, you may feel lost...

04:41.266 --> 04:44.133
unsure who you can trust...

04:44.168 --> 04:47.970
Two days ago, a woman using
one of your mother's aliases

04:48.006 --> 04:49.238
landed in Montreal.

04:49.273 --> 04:50.339
Is it her?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.174
I assume so, but we can't be sure.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.643
Look, Shelby,

04:53.678 --> 04:56.078
I know you want to
bring your parents to justice,

04:56.114 --> 05:00.081
but once you go down this
path, there's no turning back.

05:02.019 --> 05:05.754
Or the dangers you're about to face.

05:05.789 --> 05:08.657
Good news... Intel says we have a window

05:08.692 --> 05:10.346
for infiltration into Kouri's cell,

05:10.472 --> 05:12.527
- but we need to move now.
- Now?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.195
You have 24 hours to
get your lives in order.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.796
What about graduation?

05:15.831 --> 05:17.497
Consider yourself graduated...

05:17.533 --> 05:20.200
- unless you don't feel ready.
- We'll be ready.

05:20.235 --> 05:25.139
But, remember, there
will always be light.

05:25.841 --> 05:28.776
Wow. I feel for your pedicurist.

05:28.811 --> 05:30.510
I don't. That was the old me.

05:30.546 --> 05:33.012
The new me feels no
pain and doesn't care.

05:33.048 --> 05:36.015
What's going on with you? When
did you go all Kylo Ren?

05:36.051 --> 05:38.885
I'm sorry, but did you corner the
market on dark and brooding?

05:38.920 --> 05:40.619
Joke!

05:40.655 --> 05:42.288
And that's my girl.

05:42.323 --> 05:44.190
Okay, what happened? Is it Caleb?

05:44.225 --> 05:46.159
Look, honestly, I don't
want to talk about it,

05:46.194 --> 05:47.863
but as my friend, I want you to know,

05:47.864 --> 05:49.128
so if I tell you, you promise

05:49.164 --> 05:51.196
- you won't ask a ton of questions?
- Okay.

05:51.231 --> 05:53.699
I was wrong about my parents.

05:53.734 --> 05:55.534
They weren't
interested in getting to know me.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.335
- They just wanted my money again.
- What do you mean?

05:57.370 --> 05:59.337
I thought when you met
them, everything was fine.

05:59.372 --> 06:00.806
And... And those letters?

06:00.841 --> 06:04.009
Caleb was writing those,
like some demented Cyrano.

06:04.044 --> 06:05.324
- Why would he...
- You promised.

06:06.713 --> 06:10.081
You know this whole "we
don't talk" thing?

06:10.116 --> 06:11.248
Let's not do it again.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.517
I'm here for you, okay?

06:13.552 --> 06:15.285
- Whatever you need.
- Okay.

06:20.626 --> 06:23.027
Every trainee dreams of leaving Quantico

06:23.062 --> 06:24.928
and being a hero one day.

06:24.963 --> 06:26.830
But that's not always the case.

06:26.865 --> 06:28.898
20 weeks ago, your first assignment

06:28.934 --> 06:31.067
revolved around stopping
a terrorist attack

06:31.103 --> 06:32.135
before it happens,

06:32.170 --> 06:34.270
but what happens after
a terrorist attack

06:34.305 --> 06:34.971
is just as important.

06:35.006 --> 06:36.840
Each team will be assigned

06:36.875 --> 06:38.608
a terrorist attack to study.

06:38.643 --> 06:42.244
Pan Am Flight 103,
Omaha, Olympic Centennial Park.

06:42.279 --> 06:45.848
9/11, the Boston
Marathon, San Bernardino.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.249
And you have the benefit

06:47.284 --> 06:50.119
of these agents'
firsthand experiences to learn from.

06:50.154 --> 06:53.222
And we have a mission to
apprehend the suspects

06:53.257 --> 06:54.156
and bring them to justice

06:54.191 --> 06:56.191
because you don't
get to bomb a marathon.

06:56.227 --> 06:59.426
The morning it happened, I
was at a diner in Lincoln,

06:59.462 --> 07:01.729
which is an hour from Omaha.

07:01.765 --> 07:03.865
It's still tough to think about.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.868
200 hundred lives were
lost that day in an instant.

07:06.903 --> 07:10.872
And  felt like I did
on my first day of training...

07:10.907 --> 07:12.940
scared and confused.

07:12.976 --> 07:16.777
But only for a moment, because
something kicks in

07:16.812 --> 07:20.147
when you realize you just
saw a plane fly into a building.

07:20.182 --> 07:22.749
Over the next few days,

07:22.785 --> 07:25.185
you will be working these
cases from the inside out.

07:29.792 --> 07:31.891
I was wondering if I could work Omaha.

07:31.926 --> 07:34.326
I mean, it's a case that
changed my father forever,

07:34.361 --> 07:36.561
and it could help with the closure.

07:36.597 --> 07:38.798
No agent can work a case they
have a personal connection to.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.301
I mean, you don't
see Shelby working 9/11.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.735
I, um...

07:43.771 --> 07:45.237
I thought about what you said,

07:45.273 --> 07:47.339
and I'm ready to do whatever it takes

07:47.374 --> 07:49.007
to bring my parents to justice.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.241
Okay, well, I think the first step

07:50.277 --> 07:53.178
would be to lure them out of hiding,
if you can even do that.

07:53.213 --> 07:55.146
Right.

07:55.182 --> 07:56.915
Look out your window.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.349
None of those people are innocent.

07:58.384 --> 07:59.918
They're apathetic.

07:59.953 --> 08:02.287
This country only takes
action when there's a crisis,

08:02.322 --> 08:03.621
so I'm giving them one.

08:03.656 --> 08:05.089
I need to talk to Claire now.

08:05.125 --> 08:06.165
Photo op with the mistress

08:06.192 --> 08:07.657
of the VP candidate's late husband

08:07.693 --> 08:10.027
- is not on the schedule.
- I know that she is in there.

08:10.062 --> 08:11.428
Look, the senator doesn't
have time for you.

08:11.463 --> 08:13.139
The election's less than 24 hours away.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.631
If you don't let me
speak to her right now,

08:14.666 --> 08:16.566
there's not gonna be an election.

08:18.838 --> 08:20.470
Why did Natalie have to die?

08:20.505 --> 08:22.605
To keep you in line, and it worked.

08:22.641 --> 08:23.873
Threaten me all you want.

08:23.908 --> 08:25.341
I'm not gonna help
you kill these people.

08:25.376 --> 08:26.294
It's already done.

08:26.409 --> 08:29.145
You try anything, and that bomb blows.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.814
And don't try rolling down a
window or opening your door.

08:31.850 --> 08:33.249
Everything's rigged.

08:35.253 --> 08:39.366
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

08:40.038 --> 08:41.765
I knew you were perfect for this.

08:41.874 --> 08:43.582
I knew you'd do what you were told.

08:43.741 --> 08:46.587
How hard can it be to find
a blue Tacoma in this town?

08:46.623 --> 08:48.322
Where are we with street closures?

08:48.357 --> 08:49.757
I'm coordinating with NYPD.

08:49.793 --> 08:50.825
What about DITU?

08:50.860 --> 08:53.661
I want eyes on every ATM
cam, every red-light cam...

08:53.696 --> 08:54.862
Miranda.

08:54.898 --> 08:57.532
Alex Parrish isn't any
more a terrorist than you or me.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.267
She's under the
influence of one... Drew Perales.

09:00.303 --> 09:01.535
You're getting closer.

09:01.570 --> 09:03.503
Soon, all this will come to an end.

09:03.539 --> 09:05.339
Please, Drew. You
don't have to do this.

09:05.373 --> 09:07.507
Release my son, Miranda.

09:07.543 --> 09:10.076
He and Ms. Wyatt are the
key to finding and stopping this

09:10.111 --> 09:11.010
before it's too late.

09:11.046 --> 09:13.346
If we're going to release Caleb,

09:13.381 --> 09:15.515
we have to release Ryan and my sister.

09:15.551 --> 09:18.216
We're gonna need all
the help we can get.

09:19.420 --> 09:21.253
Do it. Let me see that.

09:22.757 --> 09:26.258
The Forensic Science Research
and Training Center

09:26.293 --> 09:28.894
is the premier crime lab in the U.S.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.263
It is its own division within the FBI,

09:31.298 --> 09:34.366
with over 500 scientific
experts and agents

09:34.401 --> 09:36.367
working alongside one another.

09:36.402 --> 09:39.070
Today, you will have unrestricted access

09:39.105 --> 09:40.738
to actual physical evidence

09:40.774 --> 09:43.107
from the terrorist
events you've been assigned.

09:43.142 --> 09:45.477
You've all been given key
cards to evidence libraries

09:45.512 --> 09:47.745
for your cases, and yours alone.

09:47.781 --> 09:50.448
Gather the evidence you
need and get to work.

10:04.329 --> 10:05.395
Hello?

10:05.430 --> 10:06.997
Please, Shelby, don't hang up.

10:07.032 --> 10:08.164
Mom?

10:08.200 --> 10:09.131
Did you get my letter?

10:09.166 --> 10:11.300
I'm sorry I didn't
call like I said I would.

10:11.335 --> 10:13.569
I thought after what your
friend said to us...

10:13.605 --> 10:14.370
Where are you?

10:14.405 --> 10:16.772
I'm far enough away to be safe,

10:16.808 --> 10:18.440
but close enough, I wish I was closer.

10:18.476 --> 10:21.243
Listen, we just really need to talk.

10:21.278 --> 10:22.945
I've made a horrible mistake.

10:22.981 --> 10:25.447
Is there any way that
you could come here?

10:25.483 --> 10:26.781
Well, as much as I want to see you,

10:26.817 --> 10:28.349
it's just too much of a risk.

10:28.385 --> 10:30.351
What if I can get you an immunity deal?

10:30.387 --> 10:32.320
Would that change your mind?

10:32.355 --> 10:33.688
I heard a rumor about a couple

10:33.724 --> 10:36.457
who got offered a deal
by the 9/11 Commission,

10:36.493 --> 10:38.159
but it took years to get it.

10:38.194 --> 10:40.128
But if... if I could.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.530
Well, yes. Of course.

10:41.565 --> 10:42.563
Yes, sweetheart.

10:42.598 --> 10:46.667
Okay, stay by this
number. I'll call you back.

10:53.175 --> 10:56.143
So, you and Dad are working
together again, huh?

10:56.178 --> 10:58.512
Yeah, we'd like you to come
by the house for dinner tonight

10:58.548 --> 10:59.712
so we can discuss what it means.

10:59.748 --> 11:00.747
Uh, I think I'm gonna pass.

11:00.782 --> 11:03.049
Watching you and Dad play
the Underwoods all day

11:03.084 --> 11:04.050
is enough for me.

11:04.085 --> 11:05.351
I wasn't asking.

11:05.386 --> 11:06.485
And wear something nice.

11:06.521 --> 11:08.487
We're gonna have our picture taken.

11:15.263 --> 11:16.429
Alex.

11:18.832 --> 11:20.065
What's up?

11:20.100 --> 11:22.534
I found something
new I find interesting.

11:22.570 --> 11:23.602
Jeff Michaels.

11:23.637 --> 11:25.904
That was one of your
dad's undercover aliases, right?

11:25.940 --> 11:29.041
Yeah. And this is his handwriting.

11:29.076 --> 11:31.043
- How many books are there?
- Dozens.

11:31.078 --> 11:33.311
Every week that he was
undercover in Omaha,

11:33.346 --> 11:35.646
he turned one of those in to
his handler, Fred Baxter.

11:35.682 --> 11:37.347
All undercover agents have to.

11:37.383 --> 11:39.584
Thanks.

11:39.619 --> 11:42.186
Interested in
switching assignments for a bit?

11:42.221 --> 11:43.520
Mm-hmm.

11:47.084 --> 11:49.575
An undercover
assignment your first day out.

11:49.610 --> 11:51.275
You must be excited, Raina.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.343
Or not.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.546
What are we walking
into, and... and for how long?

11:55.582 --> 11:56.748
I've read Kouri's file.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.449
Will we even survive it?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.518
I don't know how to
say goodbye to my life,

12:00.553 --> 12:02.453
and I'm terrified.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.289
Well, it's normal to
be nervous, all right?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.557
Just know that the Bureau isn't
gonna put you anywhere

12:07.593 --> 12:09.026
if they didn't feel you could handle it.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.694
Have you talked to Nimah
about how you're feeling?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.729
No, Nimah is fearless.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.464
Or at least she needs
to tell herself she is.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.133
I can't talk to her about any of this.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.234
She won't understand.

12:17.269 --> 12:18.368
Well, look...

12:18.403 --> 12:21.204
let me tell you something that
my first handler told me.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.440
Find an emotional
anchor... the person in everyone's life

12:24.475 --> 12:26.709
that keeps them
grounded, that keeps them sane.

12:26.745 --> 12:29.211
If that's not Nimah, you
need to find that person.

12:37.588 --> 12:39.288
What is up with you two?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.823
You were a lot more fun
before your "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" act

12:41.859 --> 12:43.258
morphed into "By the Sea."

12:43.293 --> 12:45.460
She is not my problem anymore.

12:45.495 --> 12:46.895
Is that why you're secretly hacking

12:46.930 --> 12:48.496
into her parents' bank statements?

12:48.532 --> 12:50.431
What do you want?

12:50.467 --> 12:53.301
Shelby just stole the
Department of Justice file

12:53.336 --> 12:54.336
my team was working with.

12:54.371 --> 12:55.470
What was in them?

12:55.505 --> 12:59.073
Statutes, transcripts, redacted
immunity agreements.

12:59.108 --> 13:01.108
She's gonna get caught.

13:02.679 --> 13:04.779
Look, I know I'm not
supposed to work a case

13:04.814 --> 13:05.934
a family member's worked on,

13:05.948 --> 13:09.283
but my friend, she wanted
me to see my father's logbooks,

13:09.318 --> 13:11.752
and I can see here that you
were his handler during Omaha.

13:11.788 --> 13:13.187
Yeah, I was.

13:13.222 --> 13:16.489
And slogging through
logbooks... That's gonna take you weeks.

13:16.524 --> 13:18.524
You know, all the
information's already culled.

13:18.560 --> 13:21.995
Right, but it says that
there should be 84 logs,

13:22.030 --> 13:23.163
one for every week,

13:23.198 --> 13:25.131
but there are only 83 in the system.

13:25.167 --> 13:27.266
Maybe he couldn't report in one week.

13:27.302 --> 13:28.168
You know, I can't remember.

13:28.203 --> 13:30.636
That's what I thought, but if you look,

13:30.672 --> 13:33.538
there's a book 78, and
there's a book 76,

13:33.574 --> 13:34.973
but there's no 77.

13:35.009 --> 13:36.975
Perhaps it's mislabeled.

13:37.011 --> 13:39.477
I wouldn't worry about it.

14:22.721 --> 14:23.518
All right.

14:23.554 --> 14:26.756
Skycam has eyes on 11 blue Tacomas

14:26.791 --> 14:28.724
moving through
Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens,

14:28.760 --> 14:30.726
but none of the
plates match Agent Booth's.

14:30.762 --> 14:31.627
The terrorist replaced them.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.694
We're running a check on the others now,

14:32.730 --> 14:35.364
but here's the thing...
When we approach the truck,

14:35.399 --> 14:36.298
we have to make sure it's the right one,

14:36.333 --> 14:38.768
because if it's not,
Perales could find out

14:38.803 --> 14:39.768
and it could push him over the edge.

14:39.803 --> 14:41.669
I agree. We have to
keep this operation quiet.

14:41.704 --> 14:42.804
If anyone finds out about this,

14:42.839 --> 14:44.739
there will be so much
chaos, we'll never stand a chance.

14:44.775 --> 14:48.777
People will panic, and
people will get hurt.

14:48.812 --> 14:49.969
I'm glad you're here.

14:49.970 --> 14:51.410
through Manhattan, and we've

14:51.414 --> 14:52.847
- just received word...
- Miranda. Look.

14:52.883 --> 14:55.349
That video has leaked of
Alex Parrish, seen here,

14:55.385 --> 14:59.086
in the garage of the
FBI's New York field office

14:59.121 --> 15:02.122
with what appears to
be a bomb of some kind.

15:02.158 --> 15:04.724
We'll keep you updated on
the nature of the bomb, as well...

15:04.760 --> 15:05.893
Alex, you look scared. Don't be.

15:05.928 --> 15:08.595
Drew, listen to me. Is this how
you want to be remembered?

15:08.630 --> 15:10.594
A terrorist? A traitor?

15:10.745 --> 15:12.612
Nothing you say can change my mind.

15:12.764 --> 15:15.301
Welcome to the end.

15:19.548 --> 15:21.588
Do you think the President should
use his emergency powers

15:21.623 --> 15:22.622
to suspend the election?

15:22.658 --> 15:23.857
I can't speak for the President.

15:23.892 --> 15:28.561
I can only speak for myself, which
is why, as of this moment,

15:28.596 --> 15:29.895
I am suspending my campaign

15:29.931 --> 15:31.830
so that I may fully assist the FBI.

15:31.866 --> 15:35.067
Miranda. I think I
know a way to find Drew.

15:35.102 --> 15:36.201
Okay. What is it?

15:36.236 --> 15:38.604
All this time, Alex has
been trying to ping a cellphone,

15:38.639 --> 15:41.406
but what if the voice
was using a land line?

15:41.442 --> 15:42.474
There are too many carriers in the city.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.308
It'll take too much time.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.677
Unless we can narrow down the field.

15:45.712 --> 15:48.913
This guy, he's skilled when
it comes to subterfuge.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.315
We need to listen to
what's between his words.

15:51.350 --> 15:53.651
Well, we could use
DITU to search for activity

15:53.687 --> 15:54.752
that matches the sounds we hear

15:54.788 --> 15:56.921
and then use that to narrow
down on Drew's location,

15:56.957 --> 15:58.990
but there's just one little problem...

15:59.025 --> 16:00.958
We're not exactly in the FBI.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.092
You are today.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.627
Track down every lead.

16:03.662 --> 16:05.395
Don't screw this up.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.031
Seriously?

16:08.067 --> 16:10.667
Caleb is two days into
withdrawals and jonesing.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.168
And we're gonna ignore the charges

16:12.204 --> 16:13.169
against her for the moment.

16:13.205 --> 16:14.805
Raina hasn't been in
the Bureau for months.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.640
Why don't you let me
conduct my operation?

16:20.878 --> 16:22.678
Wait, Miranda. You're leaving?

16:22.714 --> 16:26.015
I have a secure briefing upstairs.

16:26.050 --> 16:28.317
You can hold down the
fort for 10 minutes, right?

16:28.352 --> 16:29.571
Yeah.

16:37.661 --> 16:39.193
What's wrong?

16:39.229 --> 16:41.529
That's odd.

16:41.564 --> 16:45.634
Miranda said she was
headed upstairs for a briefing.

16:45.669 --> 16:47.836
Agent Baxter.

16:47.871 --> 16:49.671
You lied.

16:49.706 --> 16:52.139
Alex, please.

16:52.174 --> 16:55.142
Look, you have the missing
logbook, don't you?

16:55.177 --> 16:57.645
I joined the FBI to find
out the truth about my father,

16:57.680 --> 16:59.813
and I realized, over the
course of the last year,

16:59.849 --> 17:01.515
that I'll probably never know.

17:01.550 --> 17:03.416
So you don't have to
tell me why you lied.

17:03.452 --> 17:04.818
That's your right.

17:04.854 --> 17:06.720
But I still think I deserve to know.

17:08.290 --> 17:10.356
Please.

17:10.391 --> 17:11.624
Not here.

17:12.794 --> 17:15.560
Your father and Agent O'Connor

17:15.596 --> 17:17.696
went undercover with that militia,

17:17.732 --> 17:20.032
- hoping to catch them in the act.
- Right.

17:20.068 --> 17:22.535
Sometimes things don't
work out that way.

17:22.569 --> 17:25.671
Sometimes the bad guys need a nudge...

17:25.705 --> 17:29.574
a push to do the thing that
you want to catch them doing.

17:29.609 --> 17:32.690
You might even supply them with
blueprints to the building

17:32.691 --> 17:34.780
so they know where to
park the trucks with the bombs.

17:34.815 --> 17:38.950
Sometimes agents keep their mouth
shut when they're told to.

17:38.986 --> 17:40.752
Someday, you'll do the same thing,

17:40.788 --> 17:42.620
and if you ever cross that line,

17:42.656 --> 17:44.088
you better hope that you bust them

17:44.123 --> 17:46.223
before they actually push that button.

17:46.258 --> 17:48.125
I-I'm sorry.

17:48.161 --> 17:49.694
A-Are you saying that...

17:49.729 --> 17:50.594
No, I'm not.

17:50.629 --> 17:52.229
And no one ever will.

17:52.264 --> 17:54.398
That's why I burned that logbook.

17:54.433 --> 17:56.600
A tragedy happened.

17:56.635 --> 17:58.069
Americans died...

17:58.104 --> 18:00.704
servicemen and women...

18:00.739 --> 18:02.739
their children in that daycare.

18:02.774 --> 18:04.640
We moved on.

18:04.676 --> 18:06.710
I hope you do, too.

18:12.751 --> 18:14.050
Hey.

18:14.086 --> 18:16.285
Hey, did you give
Shelby your 9/11 access card?

18:16.321 --> 18:17.638
- Yeah. Why?
- She used it to steal

18:17.663 --> 18:18.955
a witness immunity agreement

18:18.989 --> 18:20.155
from the files.

18:20.191 --> 18:21.631
And we're sure that it has something

18:21.658 --> 18:22.624
to do with her parents.

18:22.659 --> 18:23.658
Our friend Spy-ris here

18:23.694 --> 18:25.493
overheard her talking on
the phone with her mom.

18:25.529 --> 18:28.330
Yeah, but an old witness immunity
agreement's useless.

18:28.365 --> 18:30.065
Unless she's using it to set them up,

18:30.101 --> 18:32.134
get them here before
calling the feds on them.

18:32.169 --> 18:33.602
That's entrapment.

18:33.637 --> 18:36.237
If EAD finds out, it's over for Shelby.

18:36.272 --> 18:38.339
What if she's willing to
tank her entire career

18:38.374 --> 18:39.841
just to try and get them arrested?

18:39.876 --> 18:41.476
Listen, I know that
you guys are friends,

18:41.510 --> 18:42.543
but, I mean, even you have to admit,

18:42.578 --> 18:45.079
she's not the same
person she was before all this.

18:45.115 --> 18:46.147
She's changed.

18:48.818 --> 18:49.650
Hey.

18:49.685 --> 18:52.485
Thank you for helping me with this.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.519
I'm helping Shelby.

18:53.555 --> 18:55.655
I may have momentarily felt
bad for you last week,

18:55.690 --> 19:00.160
but I still think you're a
dark prince unable to do any good.

19:00.195 --> 19:02.662
Dark prince?

19:04.633 --> 19:06.833
I'm sorry I called you.

19:06.869 --> 19:10.269
I'm glad you did.

19:10.304 --> 19:12.838
Everything is going so fast.

19:12.874 --> 19:17.209
I-I can't even remember why I
said yes to coming to Quantico.

19:17.245 --> 19:18.878
A-And now...

19:18.913 --> 19:21.713
I'll be losing my entire life.

19:21.749 --> 19:25.850
You said "yes" because
it's what Nimah wanted

19:25.886 --> 19:27.518
and you love your sister.

19:27.553 --> 19:30.321
It can't be reason enough.

19:30.356 --> 19:32.456
You... You don't realize
it while you're there,

19:32.492 --> 19:35.026
but the Bureau is a business.

19:35.061 --> 19:37.295
And there are other
ways to do good in the world.

19:37.330 --> 19:38.897
Like what?

19:38.932 --> 19:42.365
The company I work
for... They gave $10 million

19:42.401 --> 19:45.836
to charitable causes last
year in Africa, the Middle East.

19:45.871 --> 19:47.237
You should come work for us.

19:47.273 --> 19:49.472
No, I'm serious.

19:49.508 --> 19:50.908
It's...

19:50.943 --> 19:52.742
You'd make a great living,

19:52.778 --> 19:55.712
and you would be
contributing in a meaningful way.

19:55.747 --> 19:58.715
I can't just walk
away that close to the end.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.918
Quantico might be ending,

20:01.953 --> 20:05.922
but you are about to
start something else.

20:05.957 --> 20:07.056
Are you ready for that?

20:11.629 --> 20:12.895
No, I...

20:12.931 --> 20:14.096
- No.
- I got this.

20:14.132 --> 20:15.431
I should be treating you.

20:15.466 --> 20:16.564
What, are you kidding me?

20:16.599 --> 20:17.519
- What?
- You got a tea.

20:17.534 --> 20:18.900
All right? You're the
cheapest date ever.

20:18.936 --> 20:20.702
Cheap? What does that mean?

20:20.737 --> 20:22.304
That came out wrong.

20:35.551 --> 20:37.918
Did you really just use my access card

20:37.954 --> 20:40.454
to steal and forge
witness immunity agreements?

20:40.489 --> 20:41.222
Yes. I did.

20:41.257 --> 20:42.957
Shelby, what is wrong with you?

20:42.992 --> 20:45.592
If somebody found out, your
career could be over.

20:45.627 --> 20:46.626
Don't worry. I'm protected.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.262
What... What does that
mean, you're "protected"?

20:48.297 --> 20:50.063
This doesn't concern you, Alex.

20:50.098 --> 20:53.266
You used my access card,
Shelby, so now it concerns me.

20:53.301 --> 20:56.202
I get that you want your
parents to pay for what they did,

20:56.238 --> 20:58.204
but breaking the law is
not the way to do it.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.706
I am bringing to justice two people

21:00.742 --> 21:03.576
who have defrauded the
American government for 15 years.

21:03.611 --> 21:05.411
That is what I was trained for.

21:05.446 --> 21:07.880
You're literally forging the
document right in front of me.

21:07.915 --> 21:10.482
You realize that it's my
duty to report this, right?

21:10.517 --> 21:13.385
- Sometimes the world is gray, Alex.
- Yeah.

21:13.420 --> 21:16.054
I learn that more and more
every day, including today,

21:16.090 --> 21:18.790
but there's a big difference
between vengeance and justice.

21:18.825 --> 21:20.993
Yes, and sometimes there is both.

21:21.028 --> 21:23.561
Now get out of my room

21:23.597 --> 21:25.629
and stay out of my way.

21:33.639 --> 21:35.806
Okay, after sifting through
all the BG noise,

21:35.841 --> 21:38.475
I zeroed in on an area on
49th in between 9th and 10th.

21:38.511 --> 21:40.411
Then I ran a search for
all Drew's known associates

21:40.446 --> 21:41.511
living in that area,

21:41.546 --> 21:44.447
and I found a rental under
the name Alicia Landon.

21:44.482 --> 21:46.649
Drew's fiancée who was killed.

21:46.684 --> 21:47.930
With me.

21:48.653 --> 21:51.021
Caleb, forward me the address.

21:51.056 --> 21:53.023
Hey.

21:53.058 --> 21:55.959
You may have saved millions of lives.

21:55.994 --> 21:57.660
If they get to Drew in time.

21:58.963 --> 22:00.296
Thank you for the veil.

22:06.971 --> 22:08.971
I've
finally found it, Alex.

22:09.006 --> 22:10.872
Do you know what that feels like?

22:10.908 --> 22:12.808
I wish you could.

22:12.843 --> 22:14.776
I wish things could
have turned out differently

22:14.812 --> 22:17.545
for you and me... for us.

22:17.580 --> 22:18.846
Is that my voice?

22:18.881 --> 22:20.315
Drew?

22:20.350 --> 22:22.616
What happened? Were we drugged?

22:22.652 --> 22:24.185
Where are we?

22:24.220 --> 22:25.053
I don't know.

22:25.088 --> 22:27.021
I only did what the voice told me to do.

22:27.057 --> 22:28.056
Yeah, me too.

22:28.091 --> 22:29.342
What have I done?

22:29.461 --> 22:31.359
Well, we're gonna need to
rain-check our feelings,

22:31.394 --> 22:32.674
'cause we got to get out of here.

22:32.694 --> 22:33.961
That's a trip wire.

22:33.996 --> 22:35.895
If that door opens, everything blows.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.120
We're not supposed to be seen...

22:43.121 --> 22:44.293
In public together?

22:44.328 --> 22:46.395
What does it matter if
you're walking away?

22:46.430 --> 22:48.430
How did you find me?

22:48.465 --> 22:49.798
I asked Coombs to show me

22:49.833 --> 22:52.268
how to use the Cellphone
Trace Protocol program

22:52.303 --> 22:55.569
in case you were ever late for a swap.

22:55.605 --> 22:57.405
You didn't tell her where I am, did you?

22:57.440 --> 22:58.940
I didn't.

22:58.975 --> 23:00.141
Do you care?

23:00.176 --> 23:02.410
You're backing out, aren't you?

23:02.445 --> 23:04.379
You read Kouri's file.

23:04.414 --> 23:06.147
He's a monster.

23:06.182 --> 23:08.816
He incites murder and destruction,

23:08.851 --> 23:11.085
and we're supposed to live
with him for who knows how long?

23:11.121 --> 23:13.486
Echo his beliefs?

23:13.522 --> 23:14.922
Recruit for him?

23:14.957 --> 23:16.323
Pray with him?

23:16.358 --> 23:18.758
You can leave with Simon. Go ahead.

23:18.794 --> 23:20.827
I won't stop you.

23:20.862 --> 23:21.795
I can't.

23:21.830 --> 23:24.497
I can't go anywhere because
I'm tied to you.

23:24.533 --> 23:26.333
Tomorrow, you would be.

23:26.368 --> 23:27.968
But today, not yet.

23:28.003 --> 23:30.736
I've been pushing
you all year to do this,

23:30.771 --> 23:31.804
thinking you'd come around,

23:31.839 --> 23:34.307
and during this time, I've
learned things, Raina.

23:34.342 --> 23:35.975
This life is hard.

23:36.010 --> 23:39.178
There are compromises, hard choices,

23:39.213 --> 23:42.014
people who want from us more
than we want to give them.

23:42.050 --> 23:44.383
Trust me, I've made those choices.

23:44.419 --> 23:47.319
You can't do this for me.

23:47.354 --> 23:48.987
Only for you.

23:49.022 --> 23:51.856
I can find another way,

23:51.891 --> 23:54.725
and I'll support whatever
decision you make.

23:54.761 --> 23:57.362
Okay?

23:57.397 --> 23:59.630
I need advice.

23:59.666 --> 24:01.333
What's up?

24:01.368 --> 24:03.000
You okay?

24:03.035 --> 24:06.036
So many stories here end
the same exact way.

24:06.072 --> 24:08.705
Someone buries the
truth, a line is crossed,

24:08.740 --> 24:11.208
everyone gets hurt,
and no one knows why.

24:11.243 --> 24:12.242
My father in Omaha,

24:12.278 --> 24:14.378
Liam and the guns that
killed Drew's fiancée.

24:14.413 --> 24:16.380
Me in Chicago.

24:17.716 --> 24:19.316
Look, I think Shelby's about

24:19.352 --> 24:20.626
to make the same
kind of mistake, and I...

24:20.651 --> 24:21.051
Alex.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.052
We need to talk.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.821
O'Connor, what's going on?

24:25.857 --> 24:27.991
Why did I get an e-mail from
one of your classmates

24:28.026 --> 24:31.394
accusing you of taking
evidence from the Omaha case file?

24:31.429 --> 24:33.496
Wait. Was this classmate Shelby?

24:33.531 --> 24:36.332
'Cause that's exactly what I
came to speak to Ryan about.

24:36.368 --> 24:38.100
She stole an immunity
agreement from my 9/11 case.

24:38.135 --> 24:40.702
Before you recriminate
against Wyatt, you need...

24:40.737 --> 24:41.903
Liam, listen to me!

24:41.938 --> 24:43.872
Shelby's about to cross a line.

24:43.907 --> 24:45.073
She's gonna make a mistake

24:45.109 --> 24:48.276
that she'll regret for the
rest of her life, and I know...

24:48.312 --> 24:50.045
I know you know how that feels.

24:51.548 --> 24:54.315
Please.

24:55.584 --> 24:57.351
Caleb, what are you doing here?

24:57.387 --> 24:59.186
I've got about 5
million different reasons

24:59.222 --> 25:00.687
to ask you the same thing.

25:00.723 --> 25:02.556
Well, did Shelby send you? Where is she?

25:02.591 --> 25:03.590
We had a deal.

25:03.626 --> 25:05.893
You were supposed to
take the money and stay away,

25:05.928 --> 25:08.595
but for some reason... God
knows why... you can't.

25:08.631 --> 25:09.596
You need to leave.

25:09.632 --> 25:10.664
Shelby's on her way here,

25:10.699 --> 25:12.732
and I promised myself I
would tell her everything

25:12.767 --> 25:14.567
and we'd finally get
this all sorted out.

25:14.602 --> 25:16.162
You're not gonna get a chance to do that

25:16.171 --> 25:18.938
because that whole immunity deal,

25:18.973 --> 25:21.707
That's just a trap to
get you onto American soil

25:21.743 --> 25:23.410
so you can be prosecuted
for... I don't know...

25:23.445 --> 25:25.278
a dozen different federal
laws that you've broken.

25:25.313 --> 25:26.446
You're lying.

25:26.481 --> 25:29.415
Where are the other
agents, the sirens, the handcuffs?

25:29.450 --> 25:31.050
They're coming. Trust me.

25:31.085 --> 25:33.085
And why would you warn me?
I know what you think of me.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.986
You deserve to go to jail.

25:35.022 --> 25:37.456
You deserve to pay for every
single thing that you've done,

25:37.491 --> 25:38.823
but Shelby doesn't.

25:38.859 --> 25:41.093
I read the letter that you wrote her,

25:41.128 --> 25:43.662
that you would do
anything to be in her life again.

25:43.697 --> 25:45.596
I just don't believe you.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.398
I meant what I wrote.

25:47.434 --> 25:49.434
We came for the money.

25:49.469 --> 25:50.601
We thought it would be easy.

25:50.636 --> 25:54.072
Shelby had been out of
sight, out of mind for so long,

25:54.107 --> 25:56.474
but seeing her...

25:56.509 --> 26:00.911
It brought back all the
emotions that I had buried.

26:00.947 --> 26:03.813
I regretted
everything the second we left.

26:03.848 --> 26:06.450
Well, if that's true,

26:06.485 --> 26:08.085
take responsibility
for what you've done.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.919
Turn yourself in.

26:09.955 --> 26:11.088
That's the only way you could have

26:11.123 --> 26:13.623
an honest relationship with Shelby.

26:15.994 --> 26:18.962
You got about seven minutes until
HRT breaks down that door.

26:18.997 --> 26:20.429
Goodbye.

26:20.465 --> 26:23.832
I-I just... I just want to
be in my daughter's life.

26:23.867 --> 26:27.103
Well, that's the thing about family...

26:27.138 --> 26:29.638
You don't get to choose
when you want to be a part of it.

26:34.145 --> 26:35.744
Don't do this, Shelby.

26:37.347 --> 26:39.114
Go out for dinner?

26:39.149 --> 26:41.382
Listen, it starts small.

26:41.418 --> 26:43.618
You cover your tracks, get lucky,

26:43.653 --> 26:45.353
and then the lies start getting easier.

26:45.388 --> 26:46.621
What are you talking about?

26:46.656 --> 26:47.955
Please, just... just let him finish.

26:47.991 --> 26:49.557
Don't tell me what to do.

26:49.593 --> 26:52.059
Listen, if you want to
accuse me of something,

26:52.095 --> 26:53.127
then by all means.

26:53.162 --> 26:57.164
When we recruit sources, we
pull them in with a sin,

26:57.199 --> 27:00.667
something they'll do anything
to keep buried,

27:00.702 --> 27:03.737
but when you cross the
line, you recruit yourself.

27:03.772 --> 27:06.306
Then you start doing
worse and worse things

27:06.342 --> 27:07.441
to keep it all buried.

27:07.476 --> 27:11.544
And then, over time, the
bodies under the floorboard...

27:11.579 --> 27:14.713
They eat away at
whatever's left of your conscience.

27:14.749 --> 27:16.516
Sometimes it's better

27:16.551 --> 27:18.684
to let the bad guys get away with it

27:18.719 --> 27:20.686
than it is to be the
one who gets away with it.

27:20.721 --> 27:23.122
Can I go now?

27:24.859 --> 27:27.292
Don't do this, Shelby.

27:33.543 --> 27:35.700
All you
have to do is sit there

27:35.735 --> 27:36.855
and let what happens happen.

27:36.870 --> 27:39.737
I know you want to
move. I know you want to run.

27:39.773 --> 27:41.706
But you don't want to
kill all these people, do you?

27:41.741 --> 27:43.175
Just stay put.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.342
Don't open a door. Don't open a window.

27:45.378 --> 27:46.743
This will all be over soon.

27:46.779 --> 27:48.712
This last part is going to be...

27:48.747 --> 27:50.614
Aah! All right, I'll think of something.

27:50.650 --> 27:52.049
Just

27:52.084 --> 27:54.552
Wait, wait! Aah! Just wait!

28:05.597 --> 28:07.763
- Hurry!
- Break my thumb.

28:07.799 --> 28:09.194
- What?
- You need to get to Alex

28:09.219 --> 28:10.633
before the FBI takes her out.

28:10.669 --> 28:12.569
Break it now so we can get out of here.

28:12.604 --> 28:14.070
I'm sorry about this.

28:24.915 --> 28:27.549
Take the fire escape! Go... now!

28:28.819 --> 28:30.586
Alex! Alex, can you hear me?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.321
It's Drew... the real Drew.

28:32.356 --> 28:33.622
You were talking to the voice.

28:33.657 --> 28:35.090
Simon's on his way over
to you right now!

28:35.125 --> 28:36.190
Alex!

28:46.509 --> 28:48.808
Agent Booth.

28:48.844 --> 28:50.677
Agent Booth, are you okay?

28:50.712 --> 28:52.479
Nod if you can hear me.

28:52.515 --> 28:53.813
Are you okay?

28:55.250 --> 28:56.450
Are you okay?

28:56.484 --> 28:57.724
How you doing? You okay?

28:57.752 --> 29:00.186
Yeah, I'm all right.

29:00.221 --> 29:01.620
What happened?

29:01.656 --> 29:03.622
It was a homemade explosive.

29:03.658 --> 29:06.292
Whoever was inside is
probably already dead.

29:12.232 --> 29:13.232
Come on! This way!

29:13.233 --> 29:14.266
Come on.

29:14.935 --> 29:16.868
You all right?

29:16.903 --> 29:19.637
I need to borrow this.

29:24.678 --> 29:25.544
Drew?

29:25.579 --> 29:26.878
It's Ryan!

29:26.913 --> 29:29.046
Ryan! No, don't touch that.

29:29.082 --> 29:30.081
No, just please wait!

29:30.116 --> 29:31.348
Ryan, I'm so scared.

29:31.384 --> 29:32.149
I don't know what's happening.

29:32.185 --> 29:33.585
The line just went dead. It just...

29:33.586 --> 29:34.985
There was an explosion.

29:35.020 --> 29:37.020
I don't know if Drew's dead or alive,

29:37.056 --> 29:38.655
but I'm coming to
you right now, all right?

29:38.691 --> 29:40.491
- This street is closed, sir.
- Step back, sir.

29:40.526 --> 29:42.093
I need to speak to Alex Parrish.

29:42.128 --> 29:43.561
Simon!

29:43.596 --> 29:45.528
Simon!

29:51.803 --> 29:54.604
She's not coming with me, is she?

29:54.639 --> 29:57.240
She's chosen our mission, Simon.

29:57.275 --> 30:00.543
She's chosen to fight a
world that looks at every Muslim

30:00.579 --> 30:03.345
with fear, suspicion, or hate.

30:03.380 --> 30:07.249
She cares about you more
than I wish she would.

30:07.284 --> 30:09.084
You're not ready for her.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.619
You never think I will be.

30:10.654 --> 30:11.453
Are you willing to choose

30:11.489 --> 30:13.888
between your heart and your faith?

30:13.924 --> 30:15.790
Because that's what
you're asking of her.

30:15.826 --> 30:19.227
And whatever choice is
made, both people will lose.

30:19.262 --> 30:22.196
You will say
anything to get what you want.

30:22.232 --> 30:23.598
Do you see me holding her back?

30:23.633 --> 30:26.534
She's right there.

30:32.342 --> 30:35.909
You don't need her to redeem you, Simon.

30:35.945 --> 30:37.810
Forgive yourself.

30:46.622 --> 30:47.750
- Hey.
- We should go over

30:47.775 --> 30:48.921
the trainees' final exam

30:48.957 --> 30:51.758
one more time
before... What happened in Omaha?

30:51.793 --> 30:54.126
Why are you asking me that?

30:54.162 --> 30:56.629
Omaha was your first case assignment
out of the Academy,

30:56.664 --> 30:58.664
and you were in Chicago, too.

30:58.699 --> 31:02.668
So I'm just wondering, "What's
under your floorboards?"

31:02.703 --> 31:05.571
You want to know the truth?

31:05.606 --> 31:06.805
Or what they told me to say?

31:06.840 --> 31:08.641
And who are "they"?

31:08.676 --> 31:09.708
You know who they are.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.742
They're the ones who
talked to you after Chicago,

31:11.778 --> 31:13.278
told you how to handle it.

31:13.313 --> 31:14.812
You talked to me after Chicago.

31:14.847 --> 31:18.683
They are the ones who
decide what secrets

31:18.718 --> 31:21.252
the American people can and can't know.

31:21.288 --> 31:25.590
And you either fall in
line, or they zero you out.

31:31.730 --> 31:35.031
It was my first deep-cover op.

31:35.067 --> 31:35.999
Alex's father and I

31:36.034 --> 31:38.202
had infiltrated a
right-wing militia group...

31:38.237 --> 31:40.904
the Nebraska Liberty Defense.

31:40.939 --> 31:43.373
Six months in, and it was mostly
just talk on their part,

31:43.409 --> 31:47.476
so Michael and I were
told to expedite things

31:47.512 --> 31:51.681
by giving them the blueprints to
the federal building in Omaha

31:51.716 --> 31:54.850
that they had talked so much about.

31:56.887 --> 32:01.489
Ah, well, we were in over our heads.

32:03.893 --> 32:07.862
Before we knew what
happened, it was too late.

32:07.897 --> 32:12.434
The guilt sent Michael down a spiral.

32:12.469 --> 32:13.602
And you?

32:13.637 --> 32:17.071
Well, I held on to the top
of the bottle with one hand

32:17.107 --> 32:19.440
while he drowned at the bottom.

32:19.475 --> 32:22.909
You know, he wanted to come clean.

32:22.945 --> 32:25.412
He wanted to tell the
truth about what had happened.

32:25.448 --> 32:28.915
But they wouldn't let him?

32:33.222 --> 32:35.921
I thought that Chicago was a mistake,

32:35.957 --> 32:37.056
but it was a pattern.

32:37.091 --> 32:40.893
You find the shortcuts, and
other people pay the price.

32:40.928 --> 32:42.928
This isn't an exact science.

32:42.964 --> 32:45.231
I'm sorry. I can't follow you to D.C.

32:45.267 --> 32:46.966
I need to start my own career

32:47.001 --> 32:48.067
as far away from here as possible.

32:48.102 --> 32:49.269
No, no, no, no, no. Look.

32:49.304 --> 32:50.436
You're making a mistake.

32:50.472 --> 32:51.771
Maybe,

32:51.806 --> 32:54.205
but at least it'll be mine for a change.

33:01.848 --> 33:03.448
Shelby.

33:03.484 --> 33:04.783
- Shelby, stop.
- For what?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.285
- We need to talk about this.
- No.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.052
When I got to the hotel, she was gone,

33:08.088 --> 33:09.720
and I may never find her again.

33:09.756 --> 33:12.657
- I know. You...
- You had no right, Alex.

33:12.692 --> 33:15.159
You and... and Caleb and Iris and Liam.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.094
These are people that care about you.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.289
We were trying to protect you.

33:18.298 --> 33:19.963
You... You broke the law.

33:19.999 --> 33:22.466
You shot your own father and
lied to the police about it,

33:22.502 --> 33:24.502
and you're gonna tell me about
what is right and wrong?

33:24.537 --> 33:27.937
Alex, what you had to live
with, it almost killed you.

33:27.972 --> 33:30.507
You came here to get
answers, and you got them.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.943
But what you just
did... You took away my answers.

33:33.978 --> 33:36.012
You took away my agency.

33:36.047 --> 33:37.647
We just stopped you
from making a mistake

33:37.649 --> 33:39.369
that you'd regret for
the rest of your life.

33:39.384 --> 33:41.150
Do not tell me how I will be.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.952
You don't get to take
away my emotions, too.

33:45.189 --> 33:49.358
You know, when we first
met, we got so close.

33:49.393 --> 33:51.960
I thought, "Here... Here is my family.

33:51.995 --> 33:53.929
Here is who I was meant to know."

33:53.964 --> 33:57.766
I let you in on my life. I
trusted you with everything.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.301
You want to talk about a mistake

33:59.337 --> 34:01.969
I will spend the rest
of my life regretting?

34:02.004 --> 34:04.138
How about meeting you?

34:09.746 --> 34:12.045
Clear the area!

34:12.081 --> 34:13.481
Come on, let's move out!

34:13.516 --> 34:14.716
What happened to you? I didn't...

34:14.751 --> 34:15.882
I-I thought you might have been...

34:15.918 --> 34:17.016
Listen, Alex...

34:17.053 --> 34:18.693
I need you to get
out of the truck, okay?

34:18.847 --> 34:19.686
I can't.

34:19.722 --> 34:21.955
Drew said that the entire
truck was rigged to the bomb.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.824
- If I even move, it...
- No, no. That wasn't Drew.

34:23.859 --> 34:25.992
It was just a voice. It's
just more theatrics.

34:26.027 --> 34:27.293
Just like all of this.

34:27.329 --> 34:29.963
The WMD team has
swept the entire vehicle.

34:29.998 --> 34:31.732
There's nothing hardwired to the bomb.

34:31.766 --> 34:32.799
The bomb's not even activated.

34:32.835 --> 34:35.132
No, that's because it's a
remote-detonating device.

34:35.168 --> 34:37.069
Look at the bomb. Look at it.

34:37.103 --> 34:38.337
There's no receiver.

34:38.373 --> 34:39.572
They never put it on.

34:39.607 --> 34:41.907
This bomb was never meant to go off.

34:41.942 --> 34:42.808
What if you're wrong?

34:42.844 --> 34:44.364
What if the voice is playing you again?

34:44.379 --> 34:45.612
What if... What if I open the door and

34:45.638 --> 34:46.847
- the bomb goes off?
- Alex, they're not.

34:46.880 --> 34:47.847
- Alex, stop. Alex, stop!
- No!

34:47.882 --> 34:49.915
Or it goes off somewhere
else, like the ECC?

34:49.949 --> 34:51.190
- I can't!
- Alex, listen to me!

34:51.918 --> 34:53.885
I have been where you are,

34:53.920 --> 34:58.322
in that hotel room with
my hand on a trigger.

34:58.358 --> 35:01.622
And I would never let you make
the same mistake I did.

35:01.738 --> 35:03.327
- That was my mistake.
- No, Alex, it wasn't.

35:03.363 --> 35:05.096
I told you to let it go,

35:05.131 --> 35:06.831
and I'm not making that mistake again.

35:06.867 --> 35:08.532
I will not hurt all of these people.

35:08.567 --> 35:10.534
Alex, you are not gonna hurt anybody.

35:10.569 --> 35:12.870
You're not, okay?

35:12.905 --> 35:15.005
You can't. I promise you.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.908
You will not hurt anyone, but
you have to unlock the door.

35:17.943 --> 35:19.576
- No!
- Alex, listen to me!

35:19.612 --> 35:21.344
Just look at me.

35:21.380 --> 35:23.747
Why did you come and get me?

35:23.783 --> 35:26.115
Because you trust me, right?

35:26.150 --> 35:27.917
So just trust me now.

35:30.154 --> 35:32.154
Unlock the door, Alex.

35:46.075 --> 35:48.106
Hello?

35:48.141 --> 35:49.841
- Yeah?
- You got a second?

35:49.876 --> 35:51.676
Yeah, sure.

35:51.711 --> 35:53.812
How'd it go with Shelby?

35:56.883 --> 35:59.650
I'm sorry.

35:59.686 --> 36:01.819
You know, when I got here,

36:01.854 --> 36:04.754
I hadn't had many friends in my life.

36:04.790 --> 36:08.425
It looks like I'm leaving
here the exact same way.

36:08.460 --> 36:12.662
You know, there's something
they don't talk about at Quantico.

36:12.698 --> 36:15.632
For all the partnership and teamwork

36:15.667 --> 36:17.868
that they teach you here,

36:17.903 --> 36:20.837
they don't tell you that
being an agent is...

36:20.872 --> 36:22.805
is actually pretty lonely.

36:22.841 --> 36:25.674
Wow.

36:25.710 --> 36:26.976
Uplifting.

36:27.011 --> 36:30.313
Mm, we're all alone out there.

36:30.348 --> 36:32.215
What if I don't want to be?

36:32.250 --> 36:36.318
I mean, it doesn't
have to be the way it was.

36:36.353 --> 36:40.021
We don't have to be the
kind of agents that cut corners

36:40.057 --> 36:42.858
to close cases or miss signs

36:42.893 --> 36:47.229
or put covering our
asses over saving lives.

36:47.264 --> 36:51.532
You know, we... we both have two weeks

36:51.568 --> 36:53.533
before we start our new jobs.

36:53.569 --> 36:57.838
Why don't we take that
time and run away together...

36:57.874 --> 37:01.909
you know, off the
grid, completely off the map...

37:01.944 --> 37:04.544
and get to really know each other

37:04.580 --> 37:07.348
before we have to start working together

37:07.383 --> 37:08.983
and never get a chance to?

37:11.552 --> 37:12.852
I'm sorry.

37:12.888 --> 37:13.920
You came here to say something,

37:13.955 --> 37:16.756
and I completely steamrolled you.

37:20.628 --> 37:23.028
That can wait.

37:23.463 --> 37:25.064
Thank you for your reports.

37:25.100 --> 37:28.867
We save this lesson about
the Bureau's darkest days

37:28.903 --> 37:30.068
for the final week

37:30.104 --> 37:33.671
in hopes that it will stay with
you long after you leave...

37:33.707 --> 37:36.508
'cause too often, these
lessons are forgotten,

37:36.543 --> 37:38.944
especially in times of crisis.

37:38.979 --> 37:41.613
They get traded in for
personal crusades...

37:41.648 --> 37:43.581
I was so close.

37:43.617 --> 37:45.516
I know.

37:45.551 --> 37:47.952
I know, but cases like
this don't get solved in a day.

37:47.987 --> 37:51.389
They take months, years.

37:52.491 --> 37:54.258
Yeah, well, I can't do it by myself.

37:54.294 --> 37:57.929
Okay, well, when you work in
my office, we'll do it together.

37:57.964 --> 37:59.763
It'll be our project.

37:59.799 --> 38:01.264
Don't worry, Shelby.

38:01.300 --> 38:03.433
We'll get them. I promise.

38:03.468 --> 38:06.102
Sacrificed in favor of
what comes easiest...

38:06.138 --> 38:09.039
Hey, Dad, you coming?

38:10.976 --> 38:12.909
- Hello.
- Hey.

38:12.945 --> 38:14.978
Oh, you changed your mind about dinner.

38:15.013 --> 38:16.947
I did.

38:16.982 --> 38:17.847
And the portrait?

38:19.016 --> 38:20.449
How come?

38:20.484 --> 38:22.551
Because we're family.

38:24.521 --> 38:28.657
Abandoned in the face of fear or greed

38:28.692 --> 38:29.591
or both.

38:29.626 --> 38:33.062
But if there's one
lesson I can teach you,

38:33.097 --> 38:39.233
it's that each of you knows
in your heart what is right...

38:45.008 --> 38:46.941
Kouri's recruitment plans have changed.

38:46.977 --> 38:48.843
It won't be tomorrow.

38:48.878 --> 38:50.178
Intel says next week.

38:50.213 --> 38:52.279
We'll be ready.

39:01.190 --> 39:04.657
what is fair, and what is just.

39:07.329 --> 39:08.705
Chang.

39:08.826 --> 39:10.029
You got your security clearance.

39:10.064 --> 39:12.598
Senator Haas signed it herself.

39:20.541 --> 39:24.110
No matter how surrounded
you are by lies,

39:24.145 --> 39:27.045
don't let them in.

39:27.080 --> 39:30.281
Resist, because someday,

39:30.317 --> 39:31.849
you are going to be asked

39:31.885 --> 39:34.952
to follow an order you don't agree with,

39:34.988 --> 39:38.490
cut a corner for the greater good...

39:39.559 --> 39:40.625
and in that moment,

39:40.660 --> 39:46.497
you're going to have to
decide who you want to be.

39:57.076 --> 39:59.009
It was all theater.

39:59.045 --> 40:00.743
We were just players.

40:00.778 --> 40:01.911
Even Drew.

40:01.946 --> 40:03.146
Between the threats to his family

40:03.181 --> 40:04.080
and trying to protect Alex,

40:04.115 --> 40:06.682
he had to do whatever
the voice told him.

40:06.717 --> 40:09.852
If it was all theater,
was the bomb even real?

40:09.887 --> 40:11.421
As real as it gets.

40:11.456 --> 40:13.356
But why?

40:13.391 --> 40:15.991
To spread fear and
make a joke out of the FBI?

40:16.027 --> 40:17.725
The nightmare is over.

40:17.761 --> 40:20.362
Thanks to the brave and
tireless work of the FBI,

40:20.397 --> 40:22.897
the nuclear device is
securely in custody.

40:22.933 --> 40:26.368
I would also like to
commend Special Agent Alex Parrish

40:26.403 --> 40:29.404
for her strength and heroism.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.073
She really was born for this.

40:35.211 --> 40:37.078
It's the WMD team.

40:37.113 --> 40:37.878
The bomb is gone.

40:37.913 --> 40:41.082
Response team confirms... It's gone.

40:41.117 --> 40:42.015
The terrorist took it.

40:42.051 --> 40:44.017
But only high-ranking
members of the Bureau

40:44.053 --> 40:45.086
would know where it was taken.

40:45.121 --> 40:47.754
In this office, that's Miranda.

40:47.790 --> 40:49.090
Where is Miranda?

40:49.125 --> 40:52.358
I need to know where Miranda
Shaw is right now!

41:38.037 --> 41:41.105
I got suspicious when I
saw the footage of Alex

41:41.141 --> 41:44.341
leaked from inside the FBI building.

41:44.376 --> 41:48.044
Only a few people could
have accessed it.

41:48.079 --> 41:49.725
I should have known.

41:51.150 --> 41:52.206
Aah!

42:04.228 --> 42:05.794
Why?

42:05.829 --> 42:07.429
Why are you doing this?

42:10.067 --> 42:12.034
To make things right.

42:15.080 --> 42:19.569
