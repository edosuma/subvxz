BICKERING, ALL OF THE LITTLE
BITTY PIECES START TO TURN INTO
THIS PILE THAT NOBODY WANTS

BOOTS?

24:58.130 --> 25:01.800
GUTS ON THE RAIL.
>> Narrator: HE DISCOVERED A
UNIQUE FORM OF MOTIVATION.

25:01.934 --> 25:09.274

WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT, WHAT I

27:19.605 --> 27:26.411
CAN DO TO MAKE IT BETTER, MAKE
MYSELF BETTER, THE CREW BETTER,
THE BOAT, ALL THAT.

27:26.545 --> 27:29.614
BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO MUCH
HIGHER.
IT IS PEER PRESSURE.

27:29.748 --> 27:34.185
HE DID IT.
HE DID THE TWO FOOT OF
INTESTINES AND IT WAS

27:34.320 --> 27:41.126
DISGUSTING.
IT WAS SO NASTY.

KNUCKLEHEADS IN THE BAIT STATION
THAT CAN'T EVEN GET ALONG.

28:31.210 --> 28:35.947
QUITE FRANKLY, MORALE IS GETTING
A LITTLE THIN AROUND HERE,
MYSELF INCLUDED.

28:36.081 --> 28:39.217

>> WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> ALL I KNOW, MIKE HAD BOOTS

30:48.881 --> 30:55.787
FULL OF WATER AND POURED IT ON
THE GALLEY FLOOR.
I DON'T KNOW WHY, HE WAS PRETTY

30:55.921 --> 30:59.257
UPSET.

I GOT OTHER [BLEEP] TO WORRY
ABOUT.

31:12.638 --> 31:23.347
I'M NOT PUTTING UP WITH IT.
GETTING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS
CRAP, IT IS THE LAST THING I

31:23.482 --> 31:33.324
NEED.
THEY NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND
NOT BUTT HEADS ALL DAY LONG.

31:33.459 --> 31:37.795
I AM NOT CONCERNED WITH IT TOO
MUCH AT THIS POINT, I HAVE TO
CONCENTRATE ON CRAB.

31:37.930 --> 31:45.570
>> Narrator: STILL 100,000

BIT.

I DID NOT EXPECT 96, WAS
THINKING 50 OR 60.

32:38.123 --> 32:42.360

SURE SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF
CRAB THROWN IN THE POTS AT AN

33:34.046 --> 33:43.521

>> IT IS.
TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I AM
SKIDDISH.

35:42.007 --> 35:47.511
THE FIRE AND A WHOLE NEW PANEL.
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT THERE,
REFINED CRAB, RESTART YOUR

35:47.646 --> 35:58.589
SEASON, REGAIN MOMENTUM, AND TRY
TO KEEP IT GOING.
AND THAT'S TOUGH.

IT'S BEEN DAMN NEAR TWO WEEKS
SINCE WE PULLED THE POTS.
HOPEFULLY THERE'S CRAB IN THESE

38:01.079 --> 38:07.351
POTS, HOPEFULLY THEY DIDN'T
CRAWL OUT, HOPEFULLY THERE'S NO
HOLES, HOPEFULLY NO SAND FLEAS

EATING THE CRAB.

SITTING IDLE ON THE FLOOR OVER A

38:13.291 --> 38:19.830
WEEK, THE CONDITION OF THE POTS
IS ANYONE'S GUESS.

38:19.964 --> 38:26.436

A LOT OF HAND COILING.

LINE ON EACH POT, WITH THE

39:49.253 --> 39:55.692
COILER, SURE DOES MAKE LIFE
EASIER.

THE 8 BALL AFTER THE FIRE.
ALL I CAN SAY IS I'M THANKFUL WE
SAW A COUPLE OF DECENT NUMBERS

41:56.681 --> 42:03.553
HERE, THAT'S THE SHOT IN THE ARM
THAT I NEEDED MYSELF.
AND AS FAR AS THE CREW

42:03.688 --> 42:08.291
MOTIVATOR, THAT REALLY HELPS.
WE WERE PROSPECTING WHEN WE SET
THE GEAR.

42:08.426 --> 42:14.264
NOW WHATEVER IS IN THE GEAR IS
OLD NEWS.
I THINK NOW WE'VE GOT TO GET

42:14.398 --> 42:20.203
DOWN AND STAY POSITIVE.
FIND SOME STEADY FISHING AND,
YOU KNOW, MAKE EVERY DAY COUNT.
