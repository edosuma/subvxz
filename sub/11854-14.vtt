WEBVTT

00:06.291 --> 00:08.291
Don't make me
tie you up, Red Feather.

00:08.375 --> 00:10.417
Just come quiet and civilized.

00:10.500 --> 00:12.750
We'll scalp you first,
white man.

00:14.875 --> 00:16.250
(together)
Pow, pow, pow!

00:32.875 --> 00:34.208
(Gretchen)
'Look!'

00:35.750 --> 00:39.083
(boy #1)
'Sister Vivian,
Sister Grace, he's back.'

00:47.500 --> 00:49.083
(boy #2)
'Come on!'

00:49.166 --> 00:51.458
Sheriff's back, men.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.375
I'm sorry to hear that.

02:00.458 --> 02:03.250
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

02:03.333 --> 02:06.875
[sighs]
I know you're working on it.

02:06.959 --> 02:09.208
Yeah, I miss you too.

02:11.792 --> 02:14.041
- Boss has something.
- Yeah, good.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.834
Uh, I gotta jet, Elisa.
I'm gonna try to come this
week.

02:16.917 --> 02:20.417
Can't promise anything,
but best effort. Bye.

02:20.500 --> 02:24.417
Someone left this on the steps
of St. Emilian's church.

02:26.667 --> 02:29.208
(Lilly)
'"Unknown boy
found in box.'

02:29.291 --> 02:31.792
April 6, 1958."

02:31.875 --> 02:33.667
Will, take
a look at
this.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.166
(Will)
'Oh, that old job.'

02:36.041 --> 02:37.041
"Boy in the box."

02:37.125 --> 02:38.208
Even I heard of that one.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.333
City's most famous cold job.

02:40.417 --> 02:42.375
I've seen this up
in the commissioner's office.

02:42.458 --> 02:43.625
(Will)
'Still nags the bosses.'

02:43.709 --> 02:45.625
They never so much
as ID'd the boy.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.250
'Everyone in Philly
knew about this kid.'

02:47.333 --> 02:48.667
'"The unknown boy."'

02:48.750 --> 02:50.667
But week after week,
no one reported him missing

02:50.750 --> 02:52.083
and no one could name him.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.166
- Where'd the body end up?
- Charity field.

02:54.250 --> 02:55.625
With the paupers
and the
prisoners.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.166
- Any tags on those?
- Nah.

03:00.208 --> 03:03.750
Think the unknown boy
could be this little cowboy?

03:03.834 --> 03:05.709
Lil, there's something
on the back.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.333
"His name was Arnold."

03:44.709 --> 03:49.041
"Unknown white male, 1958.
Dumped in Fox Chase."

03:49.125 --> 03:51.041
Better known
as the "Boy in the box."

03:51.125 --> 03:55.709
400,000 circulars posted in
Philadelphia and Bucks County.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.625
Hundreds of leads,
none of them right.

03:57.709 --> 04:00.208
Kid was found in a
Liho Punch box, out in a
field.

04:00.291 --> 04:02.583
They tried to trace the box
in the schools and
restaurants.

04:02.667 --> 04:03.709
They got nothing.

04:03.792 --> 04:04.917
(Scotty)
'We know how he died?'

04:05.000 --> 04:07.542
Undetermined.
Look at the head wounds.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.875
Look at the hair.
What's the deal?

04:09.959 --> 04:12.834
One detective thought he was
killed while getting a
haircut.

04:12.917 --> 04:16.250
Homicidal barber?
Well, that's a cracked
theory.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.917
Hmm, check this out.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.750
Cops put the body in clothes,
propped him up

04:23.834 --> 04:26.125
thinking it would make him
more recognizable.

04:26.208 --> 04:29.125
- Creepy.
- They didn't think so in
'58.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.333
Not that I was
on the force then.

04:31.417 --> 04:33.166
We weren't
thinkin'
that, pops.

04:34.625 --> 04:36.333
The college kid
who found the box

04:36.417 --> 04:37.709
turned into
a frequent flyer.

04:37.792 --> 04:41.041
He came to homicide
16 times about the case.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.500
- Got obsessed?
- Or was guilty about
something.

04:43.583 --> 04:46.125
Probably want to set up
visit number 17.

04:46.208 --> 04:47.875
So who do we think
left the suitcase?

04:47.959 --> 04:50.500
Someone who's been keeping
a secret a long time.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.542
Let's see if we can
get prints off it.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.959
We've got the name Arnold,
and we've got this.

05:00.291 --> 05:02.834
Yeah, maybe someone
with younger eyes

05:02.917 --> 05:04.458
can read the
lettering
on that bus.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.709
"Fernwood Home for orphans."

05:14.333 --> 05:16.625
Sister Vivian Dole
and Grace Ashley

05:16.709 --> 05:18.792
ran the Fernwood Home in 1958.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.375
They still got
orphanages
in Philly?

05:20.458 --> 05:23.834
No, we got the outstanding
foster care system instead.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.875
- Nuns.
- 'What about them?'

05:27.959 --> 05:29.208
Ah, tough ladies.

05:29.291 --> 05:30.542
At least the ones
who taught me.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.667
Hmm.

05:34.834 --> 05:38.125
I'm afraid Sister Grace
died recently.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.500
(Lilly)
'I'm sorry.'

05:41.583 --> 05:43.709
She gave 50 years
to the church.

05:43.792 --> 05:45.583
That's a life well-lived.

05:45.667 --> 05:49.083
You and her ran the
Fernwood Orphanage in 1958?

05:49.166 --> 05:50.375
From '52 to '70.

05:50.458 --> 05:53.417
We had up to 60 boys and girls
at any given time.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.834
You must know these boys, then.

05:58.291 --> 06:00.583
Uh, they look like
Fernwood children.

06:00.667 --> 06:02.333
But I couldn't tell you
the names.

06:02.417 --> 06:04.917
How about a boy
named Arnold? Remember him?

06:05.000 --> 06:06.375
Wore a cowboy hat?

06:06.458 --> 06:07.917
(Vivian)
'Oh, it's possible.'

06:08.000 --> 06:09.834
I saw so many children
come and go

06:09.917 --> 06:12.625
I just...I don't
remember them all.

06:16.041 --> 06:20.125
Did you hear about the "Boy in
the box" case, back in '58?

06:20.208 --> 06:21.917
I don't think so.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.375
Kid was dumped in Fox Chase?

06:24.458 --> 06:26.041
It was all over the city.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.875
We lead private lives here.

06:28.959 --> 06:32.834
We read morning prayers,
not morning papers.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.458
We know the orphanage
is gone now

06:37.542 --> 06:40.750
but there must be records
from Fernwood somewhere.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.458
Oh, I believe they're all
in the basement.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.458
But I'm sure you don't want
to sift through all that.

06:46.542 --> 06:48.792
Actually, we
love
that kind of
thing.

06:48.875 --> 06:50.375
Oh, you're welcome to look.

06:53.917 --> 06:56.333
There was one Arnold
at Fernwood that year

06:56.417 --> 06:58.500
Arnold Culliver.
Six years old.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.375
So the boy in the box
has a name.

07:00.458 --> 07:02.500
(Lilly)
We have intake and adoption
records for him.

07:02.583 --> 07:03.500
(Scotty)
Who adopted him?

07:03.583 --> 07:06.041
Ruben and Lila Hanson, April 4.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.917
Two days before
he was found in that
field.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.458
He was better off
at the orphanage.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.375
(John)
'Those parents got a lot
to explain.'

07:11.458 --> 07:13.750
We'll track them down.
I want to meet these people.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.625
Arnold came to Fernwood in '53
with a sister, Gretchen.

07:17.709 --> 07:19.166
Can we find her?

07:19.250 --> 07:23.458
There's a Gretchen Culliver
listed in, uh...Roxborough.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.000
Working in the city library.

07:25.083 --> 07:27.417
You get the names
of those other kids at
Fernwood?

07:27.500 --> 07:29.959
We can figure out
who the rest of these boys
are.

07:30.041 --> 07:31.625
Maybe if the sister
gives her DNA

07:31.709 --> 07:33.917
we exhume the boy's body,
make a positive ID.

07:34.000 --> 07:38.417
We're gonna...need an ADA's
help on this one, huh?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.000
You know anyone?

07:41.083 --> 07:43.291
- Want to go talk to Gretchen?
- Sure thing.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.542
Arnold Culliver
was my brother

07:49.625 --> 07:51.917
but...this isn't him.

07:53.917 --> 07:55.375
I know it's hard to look at.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.250
Well, that's not my brother.

07:57.333 --> 08:01.083
Arnold had curls, blond curls.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.125
Is he one of these
boys,
Gretchen?

08:04.208 --> 08:06.667
(Gretchen)
'Yes, that's him
with his science club
friends.'

08:08.333 --> 08:11.208
Where'd you get that?

08:11.291 --> 08:14.750
Someone left it
along
with this circular.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.250
Well, that dead boy
can't be Arnold.

08:17.333 --> 08:19.458
He was adopted in 1958.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.625
Sister Vivian said
there's a family coming

08:23.709 --> 08:27.250
that wants a little boy.
They can't have me.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.208
I wish they wanted a girl too.

08:30.792 --> 08:32.041
I won't go, Gretch.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.750
You have to.
Even if we get separated.

08:34.834 --> 08:36.166
You know our plan, right?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.625
Meet at the horses.

08:37.709 --> 08:39.959
- 'When?'
- My 18th birthday.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.417
Go to the Breyer Horse Fair,
meet you at the horses.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.625
Don't forget.

08:44.709 --> 08:47.000
I ain't leaving you, Gretch.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.750
But he was gone one morning..

08:53.834 --> 08:55.959
...adopted late
the night before.

08:56.041 --> 08:57.875
I never said goodbye to him.

08:59.417 --> 09:04.041
Did, uh, you go looking
for him at the Horse Fair?

09:04.125 --> 09:06.208
I did, actually.

09:06.291 --> 09:08.750
He didn't show.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.125
It was lucky
Arnold found a home.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.792
'He acted up a lot.'

09:12.875 --> 09:14.166
There were two families
before this one

09:14.250 --> 09:15.834
who had taken
him and brought him back.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.709
Because of
his
behavior?

09:17.792 --> 09:20.417
And if you got too old,
you didn't get adopted at
all.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.125
You were stuck at Fernwood.

09:22.208 --> 09:24.333
That what happened to you?

09:24.417 --> 09:26.291
Yeah, I grew up there.

09:26.375 --> 09:28.291
Any idea where
Arnold
went to live?

09:28.375 --> 09:31.125
Oh, they never
told us things like that.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.208
I always imagined him
with a nice family

09:33.291 --> 09:35.834
on a horse farm somewhere.

09:35.917 --> 09:38.792
So nice, he forgot Fernwood.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.291
He was very young when he left.

09:40.375 --> 09:41.709
Gretchen, would you be willing

09:41.792 --> 09:42.959
to give us a DNA sample

09:43.041 --> 09:44.834
so we can compare
it
to this boy's?

09:44.917 --> 09:48.208
Well, I'd be glad to, but I
know
that's not my brother.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.083
I'd offer a refreshment

09:54.166 --> 09:56.959
but we don't got
much in the house.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.375
No problem.

09:59.917 --> 10:01.917
So, what's it all about?

10:02.000 --> 10:05.917
We got your name from
Gretchen Culliver, Roger.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.917
'From the Fernwood Home.'

10:08.000 --> 10:09.667
Gretchen.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.208
Was she one
of the older girls?

10:11.291 --> 10:15.834
Yeah. Her brother Arnold,
he was your age.

10:15.917 --> 10:17.125
Oh, sure.

10:17.208 --> 10:20.500
[chuckles]
That's the science club gang.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.000
That Arnold was a cut-up.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.750
- Yeah?
- Leader of the pack, you know?

10:26.834 --> 10:29.166
Drove the sisters
barking mad.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.083
(Arnold)
'We'll make a posse.'

10:36.166 --> 10:38.542
Find that old girl
and bring her on in.

10:38.625 --> 10:39.542
I got the rope.

10:39.625 --> 10:41.250
Freddy, got your spurs on?

10:41.333 --> 10:42.750
Got 'em, sheriff.

10:47.166 --> 10:48.500
What do you think you're doing?

10:48.583 --> 10:50.041
We're going to the woods.

10:50.125 --> 10:51.709
Bedtime was an hour ago.

10:51.792 --> 10:54.166
We're gonna lasso a cow,
Sister Vivian.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.875
There are no cows in the woods.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.542
That's what you think.

11:03.041 --> 11:07.041
Yeah, he was kind of
the-the holy terror of
Fernwood.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.625
So, of course, uh,
we all loved him.

11:10.709 --> 11:11.750
Hmm.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.667
Why are you asking about him?

11:13.750 --> 11:17.083
We're working a homicide
from 1958.

11:17.166 --> 11:20.500
We think the victim
was probably Arnold.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.125
Oh, no.

11:22.208 --> 11:24.583
Could you look at
a picture for us?

11:29.083 --> 11:32.959
Do you think
that might be Arnold?

11:34.875 --> 11:38.542
Arnold had blond hair, curls.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.375
And if his hair was cut off?

11:41.458 --> 11:45.542
Mm, I couldn't say yes
but...I couldn't say no.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.834
You got kids yourself, Roger?

11:48.917 --> 11:51.583
I got two boys.
Adopted.

11:55.166 --> 11:57.125
Hey.
Anything off that suitcase?

11:57.208 --> 11:59.417
Just that it was bought
at Wanamaker's in '54.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.709
Oh, only the biggest department
store in the city.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.667
That was before credit cards,
so no records.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.041
Hmm. No prints on it either.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.291
(John)
'Oh, we got the okay'

12:06.375 --> 12:07.875
from the orphan's court
to exhume the boy.

12:07.959 --> 12:09.041
Is his sister
gonna
give us a swab?

12:09.125 --> 12:10.125
She's pretty committed

12:10.208 --> 12:11.500
to this boy
not being Arnold, boss.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.959
She better get uncommitted.

12:13.041 --> 12:15.125
Blond curls or not,
that's the same kid.

12:15.208 --> 12:17.041
Find any of the other boys
in the photo?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.917
Two others are dead
besides Arnold.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.667
- One we just talked to.
- Yeah.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.917
(Will)
'Says Arnold was
a problem child.'

12:24.000 --> 12:25.542
If two different
families took him in

12:25.625 --> 12:27.333
then changed their mind,
he must have been.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.125
So Lila and Ruben bring him home

12:29.208 --> 12:31.000
he throws a fit right off.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.333
Ruben gives
him a paddling

12:32.417 --> 12:34.125
or shakes him too hard,
he ends up dead.

12:34.208 --> 12:36.166
Yeah, what else do
you
do with a dead kid

12:36.250 --> 12:37.875
besides dump him
in a field?

12:37.959 --> 12:39.667
Maybe there's a reason
they're hard to trace.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.000
You can't find them?

12:41.083 --> 12:42.709
No record of them
anywhere in Pennsylvania.

12:42.792 --> 12:44.834
(Will)
'We're trying the
national database now.'

12:47.417 --> 12:49.125
(Nick)
'Nut job. 12 o'clock.'

12:49.959 --> 12:52.166
Must be our rabbit guy.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.458
Good luck.

12:55.083 --> 12:58.208
- Detective Rush and Valens.
- Uh, Walter Rafferty.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.917
I was the one to-to find
that boy in the box.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.375
Thanks for coming in.

13:03.458 --> 13:06.583
You have something new
on the case?

13:06.667 --> 13:08.250
Possibly.

13:10.125 --> 13:11.834
He was about six years old.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.250
Wrapped in a blue blanket.

13:14.333 --> 13:16.375
It was 12:00 noon on Sunday.

13:16.458 --> 13:18.417
I followed
a jackrabbit into the brush

13:18.500 --> 13:19.917
and I came upon a box.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.709
A-a-a Liho Punch box.

13:23.792 --> 13:25.083
And there was the boy.

13:25.166 --> 13:26.041
Inside.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.291
You didn't recognize him?

13:27.375 --> 13:28.875
No. Absolutely not.

13:28.959 --> 13:31.000
You weren't involved
with him dying?

13:31.083 --> 13:32.000
Absolutely not!

13:32.083 --> 13:34.208
I took a polygraph test in 1958.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.250
- We know you did.
- I'll take one right now.

13:36.333 --> 13:38.250
I gave the
cops
a straight
story.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.166
You do any
investigating yourself?

13:40.250 --> 13:42.500
As a matter of fact,
I go back to the site every
year

13:42.583 --> 13:44.792
on April 6, and I'm not
the only one.

13:44.875 --> 13:46.041
There's a woman who
goes out there too.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.875
'I-I seen her there
for years.'

13:48.959 --> 13:51.542
Yeah. We've got that down here.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.375
She comes with white roses

13:53.458 --> 13:55.875
wearing a green plaid coat.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.417
You ever talk
to this woman?

14:10.500 --> 14:13.709
I tried a few times.
She didn't want to engage.

14:13.792 --> 14:15.834
Why is this whole
"Boy in the box" thing

14:15.917 --> 14:17.792
so big in your life, Walter?

14:19.208 --> 14:22.083
I guess you've seen
lots of dead bodies.

14:22.166 --> 14:24.083
'Doesn't bother you?'

14:24.166 --> 14:27.625
Well, I'm not built that way.

14:27.709 --> 14:31.000
This...this derailed me.

14:33.291 --> 14:35.458
I wish I never saw that rabbit.

14:40.542 --> 14:43.458
[sighs]
I think this Walter guy's
on the level, boss.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.750
Just gotten messed up
by finding the body.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.542
What do you think of
his story about the lady

14:47.625 --> 14:48.625
in the plaid coat?

14:48.709 --> 14:49.750
Fifty-fifty.

14:49.834 --> 14:51.542
Even if it's
true,
what's it
mean?

14:51.625 --> 14:53.750
She could just be
an obsessive like
him.

14:53.834 --> 14:55.125
How long you
think this'll take?

14:55.208 --> 14:56.625
One of your girls
waiting for you?

14:56.709 --> 14:58.208
What I wouldn't give
to take a look

14:58.291 --> 14:59.792
at Scotty's black book.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.291
You know what? Forget it.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.625
I can go tomorrow.

15:03.917 --> 15:05.625
(Lilly)
'Didn't want
to miss the show, huh?'

15:05.709 --> 15:08.083
We finally found records
on Ruben and Lila Hanson.

15:08.166 --> 15:09.500
(Scotty)
'And?'

15:09.583 --> 15:11.667
Well, there's a reason
they were so hard to
find.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.500
They died in 1887.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.875
Arnold's parents
don't exist.

15:25.917 --> 15:26.917
(Nick)
'Ruben and Lila Hanson died'

15:27.000 --> 15:28.792
'before the turn
of the century.'

15:28.875 --> 15:30.750
Buried at the cemetery
at St. Emilian's.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.792
The same church where
the suitcase turned up.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.041
So the adoption
papers are phony.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.500
So what happened
to Arnold the night

15:36.583 --> 15:37.667
he was supposedly adopted?

15:37.750 --> 15:39.417
Maybe he died
in the orphanage.

15:39.500 --> 15:42.166
Someone on the inside covered
it up with adoption records.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.834
Here's another layer.

15:43.917 --> 15:47.000
Autopsy of our boy positively
ID'd him as Arnold Culliver

15:47.083 --> 15:49.542
from dental records, but, uh..

15:49.625 --> 15:52.792
...Arnold's DNA
doesn't match Gretchen's.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.500
So they're not
brother and sister?

15:54.583 --> 15:57.250
Then Arnold's intake papers
were doctored too.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.083
So this kid came
from nowhere and went nowhere.

16:00.166 --> 16:02.375
- Who signed these records?
- Sister Vivian.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.500
And guess who's not talking now?

16:04.583 --> 16:06.583
(Will)
'Sister Vivian?'

16:06.667 --> 16:08.750
In seclusion.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.041
Nun on the run.

16:11.458 --> 16:15.000
- Ever staked out a convent?
- I'll go anywhere.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.250
Gretchen's gonna take this hard.

16:16.333 --> 16:17.542
Yeah.

16:17.625 --> 16:18.709
And how do we tell her

16:18.792 --> 16:20.667
not only did her brother
die 46 years ago

16:20.750 --> 16:22.208
but on top of that

16:22.291 --> 16:24.375
he wasn't
actually her brother?

16:25.166 --> 16:27.083
This must be a mistake.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.166
No. No, I'm sorry.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.125
Arnold and I came
to Fernwood together.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.917
Our parents were killed
in a train wreck.

16:34.000 --> 16:39.834
You didn't have
the same parents,
Gretchen.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.291
Sisters Vivian
and Grace knew about this?

16:42.375 --> 16:44.041
I think they must have.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.750
And they kept it a secret
from me all this time?

16:45.834 --> 16:48.333
Uh, you were young. Maybe
they were protecting you.

16:48.417 --> 16:51.500
Gretchen, we know now
that Arnold was never
adopted.

16:51.583 --> 16:54.375
There was no family
that came and took him away.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.917
And right
around
that time..

16:56.000 --> 17:00.208
...someone hurt him,
bad enough it killed
him.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.667
The best explanation right
now
is that he died at Fernwood.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.667
We need your help
thinking about

17:07.750 --> 17:09.750
who could
have hurt
him.

17:09.834 --> 17:11.583
I don't know.

17:11.667 --> 17:15.917
Was anyone ever
violent with Arnold?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.750
Freddy Baker.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.834
He's in that picture you have.

17:19.917 --> 17:22.667
He beat Arnold up
pretty bad once.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.125
Who else?

17:26.291 --> 17:28.792
Arnold got disciplined a lot.

17:28.875 --> 17:30.959
By who?

17:31.041 --> 17:32.792
Sister Vivian.

17:33.583 --> 17:34.875
Why are you back?

17:34.959 --> 17:37.583
I didn't like that family
and they didn't like me.

17:37.667 --> 17:39.625
- They kick you out?
- I ran.

17:39.709 --> 17:41.625
There was
no one to play
with.

17:41.709 --> 17:45.083
Well, Arnold, what do you
have to say for yourself?

17:45.166 --> 17:46.500
Good to be home.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.375
(Vivian)
'You're pleased with
yourself, are you?'

17:50.458 --> 17:52.500
Didn't hurt.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.834
Arnold's coming to my office.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.750
Don't, Sister Vivian!

18:03.417 --> 18:06.291
I never knew what
she did to him in her office

18:06.375 --> 18:09.500
but he came out
with a lot of bruises.

18:09.583 --> 18:11.083
Would Sister Grace
punish him too?

18:11.166 --> 18:14.208
It was always Sister Vivian.

18:14.291 --> 18:15.458
You ask Freddy Baker.

18:15.542 --> 18:18.041
He ended up in
her office a lot too.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
Fernwood. Argh!

18:26.583 --> 18:29.166
- Bad memories?
- The worst.

18:29.250 --> 18:34.083
Sorry to bring it up,
but it's
a homicide
investigation.

18:34.166 --> 18:35.166
Who died?

18:35.250 --> 18:37.792
Boy named
Arnold
Culliver.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.875
Arnold? Crap.

18:39.959 --> 18:42.000
That's one of
the few kids I liked.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.125
The way I hear it, Fred

18:43.208 --> 18:45.667
you were kind of a bully
at Fernwood.

18:45.750 --> 18:49.333
Yeah, I'd run around dropping
guys for looking at me funny.

18:49.417 --> 18:50.709
Real nice
kid,
you know?

18:50.792 --> 18:52.625
You ever drop Arnold?

18:52.709 --> 18:54.417
One time.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.542
But mostly I just left him alone
'cause he had spirit, you know?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.041
Gave the nuns hell.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.542
He was popular, huh?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.875
With the kids, yeah.

19:02.959 --> 19:05.500
Funny thing about him,
he loved it at
Fernwood.

19:05.583 --> 19:10.041
Everyone else wanted to get
out,
he kept coming back.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.875
What are your memories
of Sister Vivian?

19:12.959 --> 19:14.917
Mean old battle-axe.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.000
She's the reason I kept
my
kids out of Catholic
school.

19:18.083 --> 19:21.542
She ever whale on you
enough to do damage?

19:21.625 --> 19:23.125
Sure.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.041
She was sadistic.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.375
So you think she could
have hurt Arnold

19:27.458 --> 19:28.917
bad enough to kill him?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.041
Are you saying
Arnold
died at Fernwood?

19:31.125 --> 19:32.125
We don't know yet.

19:32.208 --> 19:33.834
I thought he
got adopted.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.834
No.

19:35.917 --> 19:40.125
Well, Sister
Vivian
was pretty
cruel.

19:40.208 --> 19:41.417
But murder?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.750
It might have
been accidental.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.917
I'll tell you,
it got pretty bad.

19:51.000 --> 19:52.208
I still got scars on my back

19:52.291 --> 19:54.750
from where she took
the belt to me.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.667
She used a belt, huh?

19:56.750 --> 19:58.083
With me.

19:58.166 --> 20:00.083
But she mixed it up.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.250
Spoons, paddles.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.333
Had a lot of
tricks in her
bag.

20:05.417 --> 20:07.709
I'm sorry as
hell
that kid died.

20:15.625 --> 20:17.875
Sister Vivian.

20:17.959 --> 20:20.875
You're a hard lady to get to.

20:20.959 --> 20:23.709
- I'm in seclusion.
- It'll only take a few
minutes.

20:23.792 --> 20:25.458
Well, I'm not
comfortable
with this.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.667
You know, I'm not comfortable
with a few things myself.

20:27.750 --> 20:29.583
Like Arnold's phony
intake papers

20:29.667 --> 20:31.000
and his phony
adoption records.

20:31.083 --> 20:32.333
I don't know
anything about
that.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.250
And the fact that
his supposed parents

20:34.333 --> 20:36.792
died in the 1800s.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.792
I'm also uncomfortable
with what I'm hearing

20:38.875 --> 20:40.625
about the
corporal punishment

20:40.709 --> 20:42.959
you gave out
at Fernwood.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.417
Raising children
calls for
discipline.

20:45.500 --> 20:50.125
Oh, you were extra rough
with Arnold Culliver.

20:50.208 --> 20:52.250
He had a serious
behavior problem.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.834
Oh, now you
remember him?

20:53.917 --> 20:56.083
Because before, you
couldn't place him at all.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.834
Yes. I remember Arnold.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.333
He was a troubled boy.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.542
And you just didn't
feel
like telling me

21:02.625 --> 21:03.792
and my partner that before?

21:03.875 --> 21:05.166
We lead private lives here

21:05.250 --> 21:06.333
and I believe in discretion.

21:06.417 --> 21:07.709
I don't like prying eyes.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.333
Because they might
discover what you
did.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.834
I didn't do anything out of
the
ordinary to those children.

21:11.917 --> 21:15.041
You left kids
with lifelong
scars.

21:15.125 --> 21:17.834
Maybe it sounds scandalous today

21:17.917 --> 21:19.875
but it was routine in 1958.

21:19.959 --> 21:21.417
Hmm.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.667
So maybe in a routine pummeling

21:23.750 --> 21:26.041
of Arnold one night,
he fell unconscious

21:26.125 --> 21:27.709
from one of your blows.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.458
Died, in fact.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.667
You'd want to be
discreet
about at event

21:31.750 --> 21:33.875
so maybe you
cut off those blond
curls

21:33.959 --> 21:36.792
so no one recognized
him,
put him in a box

21:36.875 --> 21:39.500
and privately
took him to a
field

21:39.583 --> 21:41.583
and dumped him.

21:42.875 --> 21:47.041
That's a remarkable thing
to say to a woman of God.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.458
Is it true?

21:49.834 --> 21:51.291
No.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.875
Why did you fake Arnold's
intake
and adoption records?

21:53.959 --> 21:55.041
I didn't.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.458
Your signature's on
both sets of papers.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.750
Sister Grace did the paperwork
and I as the senior sister

22:00.834 --> 22:03.166
at Fernwood,
signed the documents.

22:03.250 --> 22:06.417
Was Sister Grace as fond of
corporal punishment as you are?

22:06.500 --> 22:09.000
- I won't speak ill of the dead.
- Why did she fake the records?

22:09.083 --> 22:12.458
Why did she do any of the
stupid things that she did?

22:12.542 --> 22:14.083
Sister Grace was a screw up.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.166
She was weak-willed,
she was unreliable

22:16.250 --> 22:18.667
and she couldn't
discipline the children

22:18.750 --> 22:20.166
and that's why I had to.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.000
What's your name?

22:26.083 --> 22:28.750
He's Arnold.

22:28.834 --> 22:31.667
Do you like
swimming, Arnold?

22:31.750 --> 22:33.208
I like horses.

22:33.291 --> 22:34.959
(male #1)
'I'm afraid we don't
have any of those'

22:35.041 --> 22:38.500
but we do have a membership
at the Haverford swimming pool.

22:40.166 --> 22:41.583
Does that sound
like fun?

22:48.208 --> 22:49.875
Pow, pow, pow, pow!

22:56.875 --> 22:59.291
Don't socialize
with the parents so much.

22:59.375 --> 23:00.959
I'm sorry.

23:01.041 --> 23:03.125
Arnold just shoved a woman.

23:03.208 --> 23:06.041
I told him, best behavior.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.917
We have to control him, Grace.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.500
He'll never get a home
if we don't.

23:19.208 --> 23:20.750
Could Grace have hurt Arnold?

23:20.834 --> 23:22.041
Grace..

23:25.917 --> 23:28.625
Some stories
shouldn't be
told.

23:31.417 --> 23:34.458
Vivian claimed Grace was the
one
to doctor the records.

23:34.542 --> 23:35.959
Is she
offering
a reason why?

23:36.041 --> 23:37.667
She was mysterious
about her.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.417
And conveniently, Grace is dead.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.291
How'd it go
with Fred, the bully?

23:42.375 --> 23:43.625
He's a decent guy.

23:43.709 --> 23:45.625
Adopted twins from Romania.

23:45.709 --> 23:47.208
- Did he do in Arnold?
- 'Nah.'

23:47.291 --> 23:49.709
But he confirmed Sister Vivian
was good and vicious.

23:49.792 --> 23:51.458
Found the last kid
in the photo.

23:51.542 --> 23:52.750
It's Paul Evans.

23:52.834 --> 23:53.959
He add anything to the picture?

23:54.041 --> 23:56.375
More of the same. Loved Arnold.

23:56.458 --> 23:57.834
'Terrified of Sister Vivian.'

23:57.917 --> 23:59.542
(Will)
'One thing struck us though.'

23:59.625 --> 24:01.125
He said he couldn't have kids.

24:01.208 --> 24:05.542
Yeah, first guy we found,
Roger, he adopted his kids.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.000
Uh, Fred adopted too.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.166
(Will)
'That's what we mean.'

24:08.250 --> 24:09.500
Three out of
the six boys

24:09.583 --> 24:12.500
on that photo
don't or can't have kids.

24:12.583 --> 24:15.917
Maybe orphans are more likely
to adopt when they grow up.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.208
Three out of six, Lil?

24:17.291 --> 24:20.250
That's a cluster,
not a coincidence.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.542
Gretchen said this is a
picture
of the science club boys.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.208
- Right?
- Right.

24:24.291 --> 24:27.667
Maybe we need to find out
what they did at this club.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.250
Uh, the boys went
to science club on Fridays

24:35.333 --> 24:37.583
uh, while the rest of us
had music class.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.500
Science club
wasn't
at Fernwood?

24:39.583 --> 24:42.834
No, they went someplace else.
Uh, took that bus.

24:42.917 --> 24:45.750
- By themselves?
- Sister Grace went with them.

24:45.834 --> 24:46.875
You know what they did there?

24:46.959 --> 24:48.875
No. It was only for boys.

24:48.959 --> 24:51.000
And you don't know
where it was.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.417
No, but I think
that picture you have

24:52.500 --> 24:55.458
was taken
wherever the club was
held.

24:55.542 --> 24:56.750
Was it?

24:56.834 --> 24:59.500
That building's not Fernwood.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.667
(Scotty)
'Maybe we blow this up?'

25:05.000 --> 25:08.750
Science club was,
um,
just a weekly field
trip.

25:08.834 --> 25:10.250
To where?

25:10.333 --> 25:13.625
A hospital
type
building.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.792
What kind of things
did you do there?

25:16.875 --> 25:18.667
It was different every time.

25:18.750 --> 25:22.834
Could you give us
a for instance?

25:22.917 --> 25:25.709
One time we had breakfast
in the afternoon.

25:36.583 --> 25:38.208
- Hello, doctor.
- Sister Grace.

25:45.458 --> 25:46.625
Hello, boys.

25:46.709 --> 25:48.917
Do we have to give
blood today, Dr. Thayer?

25:49.000 --> 25:51.834
No. Today all you have
to do is eat cornflakes.

25:51.917 --> 25:54.542
- We just had lunch!
- I hope you're hungry.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.208
It was fun.

26:02.291 --> 26:03.458
Nothing scary about it.

26:03.542 --> 26:05.834
Do you know
Dr. Thayer's first name?

26:05.917 --> 26:08.291
Hmm. Nah, sorry.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.792
Roger, we have to ask
you
a personal question.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.750
Okay.

26:12.834 --> 26:16.959
Did you adopt kids because
you couldn't have your own?

26:17.041 --> 26:18.208
Yeah.

26:18.291 --> 26:22.458
That was your side,
not your wife's.

26:22.542 --> 26:24.125
How'd you know that?

26:24.208 --> 26:26.834
All three men still
alive from science
club

26:26.917 --> 26:28.500
confirmed as sterile.

26:28.583 --> 26:30.000
How you gonna blame that
on cornflakes?

26:30.083 --> 26:31.542
I don't know, and I don't
know
what it's got to do

26:31.625 --> 26:33.166
with Arnold's head
wounds,
either.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.458
We got to find out what else
was going on in this place,
Lil.

26:35.542 --> 26:37.291
Got a partial
name
on the building.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.667
Uh, h-o-something,
i-n-something.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.291
Something...institute?

26:43.375 --> 26:45.125
Hoover Institute, in Fairmount.

26:45.208 --> 26:47.208
So let's look for anyone
who worked there in '58

26:47.291 --> 26:48.917
starting with Dr. Thayer.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.834
Uh..

26:50.917 --> 26:53.000
...I got something, Lil.

26:53.083 --> 26:54.583
Okay.

26:54.667 --> 26:56.166
You know what,
I can go tomorrow.

26:56.250 --> 26:58.834
You've been saying that all
week, Scotty, but you never
go.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.500
Yeah.

27:00.583 --> 27:02.500
I'll meet you in
the morning,
Scotty.

27:02.583 --> 27:04.834
- First thing?
- First thing.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.458
Alright, you want me
to auto-track Thayer?

27:10.542 --> 27:12.709
Uh, maybe let me, boss.

27:12.792 --> 27:17.041
No, I got to learn how to run
this computer sometime, Lil.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.250
Is it on?

27:33.166 --> 27:35.375
(Scotty)
'Sorry I'm late.'

27:35.458 --> 27:38.166
The bus was parked
right over there.

27:38.250 --> 27:40.208
We know what was
going on here in the '50s?

27:40.291 --> 27:41.750
Government research.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.083
Dr. Milton Thayer
was using
volunteers

27:44.166 --> 27:48.458
including the boys
from Fernwood...as test
groups.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.375
What was Fernwood
getting in return?

27:50.458 --> 27:53.583
They were paid a fee
for every boy they brought
over.

27:53.667 --> 27:54.834
I got the contracts.

27:54.917 --> 27:58.125
- Sister Vivian set this up?
- Nope.

27:58.208 --> 27:59.834
Sister Grace.

28:01.375 --> 28:02.667
What kind of tests
are we talking?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.792
That's what we
got to ask Dr.
Thayer.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.917
He's an emeritus
researcher here.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.750
(Milton)
'Yeah, I remember
the Fernwood boys.'

28:09.834 --> 28:13.375
'They were subjects in a
series
of radiation tests for us.'

28:13.458 --> 28:15.875
- Radiation?
- Right.

28:15.959 --> 28:18.917
We heard something
about cornflakes.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.041
That was one of the methods.

28:21.125 --> 28:22.583
How'd that work?

28:22.667 --> 28:25.000
The milk was irradiated.

28:25.083 --> 28:27.375
You gave radioactive
milk
to six-year-old boys?

28:27.458 --> 28:28.667
(Milton)
'Very low levels.'

28:28.750 --> 28:30.250
And we also put it
in the toothpaste

28:30.333 --> 28:33.000
and had them brush
their teeth with
it.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.542
This was
government-sponsored?

28:35.625 --> 28:38.417
- You're what, 30 years old?
- Yeah.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.667
So you don't remember
the cold war?

28:40.750 --> 28:41.834
What about it?

28:41.917 --> 28:43.417
We lived in fear of the bomb.

28:43.500 --> 28:45.959
Radiation research was
considered necessary.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.458
It was even patriotic.

28:47.542 --> 28:51.667
Did you know your tests
left three men sterile?

28:51.750 --> 28:53.250
We didn't intend to harm anyone

28:53.333 --> 28:56.125
but at the time,
we were working for a cause.

28:56.208 --> 28:58.417
So you don't regret
the tests?

28:58.500 --> 29:00.792
We worked within the boundaries
of what we knew.

29:00.875 --> 29:03.542
'Back in the '50s, we thought
those tests would do us good.'

29:03.625 --> 29:06.667
We also performed lobotomies,
which we now think are barbaric

29:06.750 --> 29:08.291
but at the time,
it was considered

29:08.375 --> 29:09.959
'cutting-edge medicine.'

29:10.041 --> 29:11.625
Uh-huh.

29:14.375 --> 29:17.667
Can't help the
times
you live in.

29:17.750 --> 29:21.959
So Sister Grace
arranged
the visits to the
institute.

29:22.041 --> 29:23.792
Think she knew what
she was doing to these kids?

29:23.875 --> 29:26.000
She was a nun,
not a doctor.

29:26.083 --> 29:29.500
And back in '58, the culture
was doctors could do no wrong.

29:29.583 --> 29:30.750
You didn't question them.

29:30.834 --> 29:32.667
You didn't question
the government either.

29:32.750 --> 29:34.208
They funded the tests.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.959
Been looking into
what else was going on

29:36.041 --> 29:37.709
at the Hoover Institute in '58.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.709
- A lot of behavioral
research.
- What's that mean?

29:40.792 --> 29:42.375
Trying to straighten out
psychotics

29:42.458 --> 29:46.417
by way of insulin treatments,
isolation tanks, electroshock.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.959
Oh, God.

29:48.041 --> 29:50.500
Tell me they didn't test
that on the orphans.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.458
That would explain
Arnold's head wounds.

29:52.542 --> 29:55.250
I auto-tracked an ancient
nurse,
used to work in behavior.

29:55.333 --> 29:56.583
- Still in Philly?
- Yeah.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.166
Sally Thurber,
old lady now

29:59.250 --> 30:02.083
kicking it
in a retirement community.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.500
I remember that
boy in the box
case.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.208
I never put it
together
with Fernwood.

30:07.291 --> 30:08.625
Well, no one did.

30:08.709 --> 30:11.208
Those boys were darlings.

30:11.291 --> 30:14.375
Did you know any of them? Maybe
they were research subjects?

30:14.458 --> 30:16.875
[chuckles]
Oh, not for us. No.

30:16.959 --> 30:20.542
'I just saw them around
the institute in their..'

30:20.625 --> 30:23.000
...little grey uniforms.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.709
'I'd talk to the nun'

30:24.792 --> 30:27.250
who brought them sometimes.

30:27.333 --> 30:28.458
Sister Grace?

30:28.542 --> 30:30.792
She'd come down
to behavior

30:30.875 --> 30:31.792
once in a while.

30:31.875 --> 30:34.208
Yeah? Why would she do that?

30:34.291 --> 30:38.333
Well...I suppose
everyone's dead now

30:38.417 --> 30:41.792
'so I can speak
out of school.'

30:41.875 --> 30:44.041
Please.

30:44.125 --> 30:47.083
She'd come visit Clayton..

30:47.166 --> 30:50.250
...an assistant in our lab.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.417
A medical student..

30:52.500 --> 30:54.709
'...and they were friendly.'

30:56.000 --> 30:57.208
Friendly how?

30:57.291 --> 30:59.583
Well, more friendly
than a nun should be

30:59.667 --> 31:03.250
with a young man,
in my opinion.

31:03.333 --> 31:06.291
(Grace)
'He's a good boy at heart,
but he acts up.'

31:07.917 --> 31:09.750
- You look beautiful, Grace.
- Shh.

31:09.834 --> 31:10.959
I can't tell you that?

31:11.041 --> 31:13.333
(Grace)
'Clay, he needs
a family.'

31:13.417 --> 31:16.583
'I'm worried he won't get
one if he doesn't change.'

31:16.667 --> 31:18.208
He'll outgrow it.

31:18.291 --> 31:21.000
No. It's getting worse.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.417
Please help him.

31:23.834 --> 31:26.125
I don't know what
you want me to do.

31:26.208 --> 31:28.000
The treatment you give
the patients here.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.917
- That's not for children.
- 'Does it work?'

31:32.000 --> 31:33.959
It's very effective.

31:34.041 --> 31:35.875
Calms them down, right?

31:35.959 --> 31:37.041
Right.

31:37.125 --> 31:40.000
- I know it could help him.
- Grace.

31:40.083 --> 31:42.500
There's an
adoption
party tomorrow.

31:42.583 --> 31:45.667
Please. For me, Clay.

31:49.417 --> 31:51.792
Did you ever see the boy
they were talking about?

31:51.875 --> 31:54.083
That same night
I was leaving

31:54.166 --> 31:55.875
I saw Grace again

31:55.959 --> 31:58.458
with that little boy in tow.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.500
Where were they going?

31:59.583 --> 32:01.500
I assumed to see Clayton

32:01.583 --> 32:04.583
to get that
treatment
she asked for.

32:04.667 --> 32:06.458
What was that treatment?

32:06.542 --> 32:07.500
ECT.

32:07.583 --> 32:09.667
Shock treatment.

32:09.750 --> 32:13.542
(Sally)
'I remember that night
because that's the only time'

32:13.625 --> 32:16.625
'I ever saw Grace
out of her habit.'

32:16.709 --> 32:19.333
I never even knew
she had blonde
hair.

32:19.417 --> 32:22.917
What was she wearing
that night?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.458
A plaid coat.

32:26.542 --> 32:29.041
'A green plaid coat.'

32:35.166 --> 32:36.834
Sounds like Sister Grace
and Clayton

32:36.917 --> 32:38.166
were some kind of item.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.959
He knew how
to administer ECT

32:40.041 --> 32:42.041
which was supposed
to control wild behavior.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.917
And she wanted a boy controlled
for an adoption party.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.542
There was a party
at Fernwood on April
5.

32:47.625 --> 32:49.542
The day before
Arnold was found.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.417
So maybe on April
4,
Grace and Arnold

32:51.500 --> 32:52.959
secretly come to the institute.

32:53.041 --> 32:55.542
She's wearing lay clothes,
so no one recognizes her--

32:55.625 --> 32:57.291
Except for Sally, the busybody.

32:57.375 --> 32:58.709
She's in a
green
plaid coat

32:58.792 --> 33:00.667
just like the woman
our rabbit guy saw

33:00.750 --> 33:02.208
in that field
over the
years.

33:02.291 --> 33:03.375
Probably Grace.

33:03.458 --> 33:04.917
And before you give
shock treatment..

33:05.000 --> 33:06.542
...you cut off
the patient's hair.

33:06.625 --> 33:08.542
Grace has the same coat,
all those years?

33:08.625 --> 33:10.458
How many coats does a nun have?

33:10.542 --> 33:12.709
Why does she go to
such lengths for this kid

33:12.792 --> 33:14.250
when she's got 60 kids
who need help?

33:14.333 --> 33:15.583
Yeah. Why Arnold?

33:15.667 --> 33:17.041
(Lilly)
'Ms. Sally makes it sound'

33:17.125 --> 33:19.041
like Grace and
Clayton
had a relationship.

33:19.125 --> 33:20.417
Yeah?

33:20.500 --> 33:23.959
We still don't know
who Arnold's parents
were.

33:24.041 --> 33:27.166
And why Grace doctored
those intake records.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.041
That's sacrilegious.

33:29.125 --> 33:30.583
Lil, she was a nun.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.542
She was also human.

33:39.125 --> 33:40.333
We can talk here.

33:40.417 --> 33:42.041
You probably
don't want the sisters

33:42.125 --> 33:44.375
overhearing this conversation.

33:44.458 --> 33:45.709
What is it now?

33:45.792 --> 33:49.250
We think we know
who Arnold's mother was.

34:05.417 --> 34:08.583
I didn't want to tell
the story of Grace.

34:08.667 --> 34:10.959
I know you didn't.

34:11.041 --> 34:12.959
But a little
boy
died, Vivian.

34:13.041 --> 34:14.542
Her little boy.

34:18.333 --> 34:22.041
Grace was...not a good nun.

34:22.125 --> 34:23.291
No kidding.

34:23.375 --> 34:26.208
She was dreamy. Weak.

34:26.291 --> 34:28.500
She had good intentions..

34:28.583 --> 34:32.583
...she just didn't have
self-control.

34:32.667 --> 34:35.959
Do you know Clayton Waters?

34:36.041 --> 34:37.458
He was Grace's ruin.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.291
She was in love with him?

34:39.375 --> 34:41.625
Till the day she died.

34:41.709 --> 34:44.458
When she was 18,
she came to me and..

34:44.542 --> 34:46.959
...told me she was pregnant.

34:47.041 --> 34:49.083
I probably should have
just told mother superior

34:49.166 --> 34:53.083
but instead, I helped her
go away for a few months.

34:55.041 --> 34:57.291
(Lilly)
'You and Grace were close?'

34:57.375 --> 34:59.834
Like blood sisters.

34:59.917 --> 35:02.667
She promised to leave the baby
at a Pittsburgh orphanage.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.041
But...she just couldn't

35:04.125 --> 35:05.959
and so she brought him
back to Fernwood.

35:06.041 --> 35:10.458
And, uh, slipped him in
as Gretchen's brother.

35:10.542 --> 35:13.166
He became our cross to bear.

35:13.250 --> 35:15.166
Misbehaving all the time.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.542
Couldn't hold
onto a family, and..

35:16.625 --> 35:19.000
...he was getting older,
less adoptable.

35:20.959 --> 35:23.208
Did he know Grace
was his mother?

35:25.750 --> 35:28.125
We never told him.

35:34.625 --> 35:36.542
But I think a part of him..

35:36.625 --> 35:39.375
...knew that he was
home with Grace.

35:39.458 --> 35:43.375
That's why he kept
coming back.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.750
So what happened
to Arnold on April
4?

35:46.834 --> 35:49.542
Oh, April 4, well..

35:49.625 --> 35:54.166
On April 4, Grace was
desperate to find him a home.

35:54.250 --> 35:55.917
Right.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.625
Before I tell you the rest,
I want you to know

35:57.709 --> 36:01.083
that everything Grace did,
she did because she loved him.

36:04.875 --> 36:07.083
Vivian. Vivian!

36:09.291 --> 36:10.750
What are you wearing?

36:10.834 --> 36:12.166
Arnold's sick.

36:17.166 --> 36:19.417
What in the
world
has happened?

36:19.500 --> 36:22.917
Clayton treated him.
To help him behave.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.959
You're not supposed
to see Clayton.

36:27.041 --> 36:29.625
We had to cut his hair off.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.417
'His beautiful hair.'

36:32.500 --> 36:34.834
Did Clayton say
he'd be sick like this?

36:34.917 --> 36:36.500
He said he might
feel tired

36:36.583 --> 36:39.333
but Vivian, he's got
such a fever.

36:43.542 --> 36:45.250
We have to pray for him.

36:46.834 --> 36:49.291
I thought it would help.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.125
He'd behave,
and then some couple

36:51.208 --> 36:53.917
would want him,
and keep him.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.750
Say a prayer, Grace.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.667
It was supposed to calm him..

37:02.750 --> 37:05.917
...to control him.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.542
Grace never dreamt
it would be harmful.

37:09.625 --> 37:13.125
Did Arnold make it
to the adoption
party?

37:13.208 --> 37:14.458
No.

37:15.291 --> 37:18.125
No, his fever got worse.

37:24.250 --> 37:27.125
We're out of
punch,
Sister Vivian.

37:27.208 --> 37:30.750
Mm. Th-there's a new box
in the kitchen.

37:30.834 --> 37:33.083
Where's Arnold?

37:33.166 --> 37:34.917
He'll be down soon.

37:36.917 --> 37:38.208
Go talk to people.

37:56.083 --> 37:58.625
He's going, Vivian.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.792
(Arnold)
'I'll meet you.'

38:03.333 --> 38:04.917
Oh, Arnold.

38:06.041 --> 38:08.750
I hope you know I loved you.

38:08.834 --> 38:12.208
I'll meet you..

38:12.291 --> 38:14.834
...at the horses.

38:27.125 --> 38:28.291
(Vivian)
'Shh.'

38:54.041 --> 38:56.709
What are you doing?

38:56.792 --> 38:59.834
- Clean the room up.
- I want to come.

38:59.917 --> 39:01.667
Grace!

39:01.750 --> 39:05.125
This is not one
of your little screw-ups.

39:05.208 --> 39:07.875
This is very serious.

39:35.834 --> 39:37.417
I'm coming too.
