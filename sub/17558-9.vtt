WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.071
Isn't this fun?

00:03.104 --> 00:04.305
Planting narcissus
bulbs for the holidays.

00:04.338 --> 00:05.506
Who doesn't love
a potting party?

00:05.539 --> 00:08.008
This isn't like any pot party
I ever been to.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.311
These bulbs won't even be
sprouting by Thanksgiving.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.645
Oh, who cares about
Thanksgiving?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.314
David and I don't
participate in it.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.649
The only tradition we have
is avoiding our families.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.151
Yep, every year we sneak up

00:17.185 --> 00:19.187
to Big Sur and
hide in a hot tub.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.722
Our only nod to the day is
eating turkey meat loaf

00:21.755 --> 00:23.023
and drinking
cranberry vodka.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.392
I don't do turkey day either.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.494
The last Thanksgiving I did
with my family

00:26.527 --> 00:29.563
was a hot negative mess.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.500
Big news, guys,
I got a new job!

00:32.533 --> 00:33.767
Cheesecake Factory?

00:33.801 --> 00:35.169
You got your work cut
out for you.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.004
I love that
strawberry lemonade,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.939
but that menu is huge.

00:38.972 --> 00:41.175
Thank God for those pictures.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.843
I'm not working at no dang
Cheesecake Factory.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.846
I am the new assistant
to Mr. Bryan Collins.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.782
Daddy, my dreams
are coming true.

00:48.816 --> 00:51.018
Dreams don't pay
no bills, Rocky.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.186
Neither do you, dummy.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.188
You ain't gonna make it out
there in that big city.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.189
You said the same thing
about me.

00:55.223 --> 00:56.857
You moved to LA, and then

00:56.890 --> 00:58.459
what do you have to show for it?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.527
I became a paramedic.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.296
And I still ain't got
but one foot.

01:02.330 --> 01:06.367
Raquel-Marie, we're just saying
you're not Hollywood material.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.570
You're more like, uh,
Flint, Michigan material.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.639
I am so tired of the two
of you putting me down.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.541
I'm gonna be somebody someday,

01:13.574 --> 01:14.642
you just wait
and see.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.577
Just 'cause your dreams
didn't come true,

01:16.610 --> 01:17.978
doesn't mean mine won't.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.281
My dream happen to be eating
that pecan pie right there.

01:20.314 --> 01:21.915
Now pass it on down, girl.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.819
Well, Thanksgiving was no picnic
in Ohio either.

01:25.853 --> 01:28.222
The last one was a nightmare.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.391
Oh, Jane,
what a wonderful dinner:

01:30.424 --> 01:32.560
turkey, ham and roast beef?

01:32.593 --> 01:34.562
So glad I wore my pajama jeans.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.230
Right, like you have any others.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.831
Do you have any
green beans?

01:37.865 --> 01:40.234
No, honey, vegetables
are for the poor.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.769
I wouldn't be caught dead
serving one.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.837
Nana, that's not true,
we have potatoes.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.340
Potatoes are cushions for gravy.

01:46.374 --> 01:48.409
And what is gravy?
Liquid meat.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.611
Meat is a symbol of success.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.012
Charity,
this Jell-O dish

01:52.045 --> 01:54.615
with marshmallows and grapes
is perfect.

01:54.648 --> 01:55.849
Can I get the recipe?

01:55.883 --> 01:58.586
Oh, Goldie, you don't have
to pretend you cook.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.920
We're family.
I'll just bring one over

01:59.953 --> 02:03.857
next time I come to do
Clay's laundry properly.

02:05.659 --> 02:10.531
Bryan, what do you say we skip
the hot tub meat loaf this year

02:10.564 --> 02:12.099
and start
a new Thanksgiving tradition?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.100
Just the five of us.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.302
We'll stay here and hide away

02:14.335 --> 02:16.103
from our crazy families
together.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.139
I love it, it's a girls
and gays Thanksgiving.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.941
We can have turkey
and watch movies

02:20.974 --> 02:22.876
where guys pretend to be
attracted to Rachel McAdams.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.044
You girls in?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.946
Yes, we'd love to.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.317
Okay, I'll do Thanksgiving,
but it's going on my time card.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.290
SHANIA: Why did we drive
90 miles to Ojai

02:36.324 --> 02:37.858
to get a Thanksgiving turkey?

02:37.891 --> 02:39.293
BRYAN: Well,
since your mom is pregnant,

02:39.327 --> 02:41.295
I thought we should try to find
one that was organically raised,

02:41.329 --> 02:43.631
you know, no hormones,
no antibiotics.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.865
Plus, Ojai is so beautiful.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.401
I think I'd like to buy Ojai.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.303
Hey there, folks,
what can I do you for?

02:49.337 --> 02:52.573
Well, we need a turkey
for our Thanksgiving dinner.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.975
You go ahead and pick out
the one you like.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.245
Oh... I think
you misunderstood.

02:57.278 --> 03:00.180
We don't want one that's alive
and full of feathers and life.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.482
We want one
that's dead

03:01.515 --> 03:03.484
and wrapped in a simple
brown paper package

03:03.517 --> 03:04.518
with a raffia string.

03:04.552 --> 03:05.886
Oh, the way it works is,

03:05.919 --> 03:08.856
you pick out your favorite
and then you can...

03:09.690 --> 03:10.691
...lop its head off.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.825
Well, we don't want
to do that.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.826
Oh, you're squeamish, huh?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.762
That's all right,
for an extra five dollars,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.697
I'll have
my seven-year-old do it.

03:16.730 --> 03:17.865
Wait, are you telling
me that all these

03:17.898 --> 03:19.667
display turkeys
are gonna be killed?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.435
Well, son, what is it
you think we do here?

03:21.469 --> 03:24.204
Well, I don't know, I thought
you had a freezer in the back
with the ready-to-go kind,

03:24.238 --> 03:26.840
and all this bloody,
gory stuff happened at night

03:26.874 --> 03:29.042
in some secret,
off-site poultry Guantanamo

03:29.076 --> 03:31.279
while the townspeople slept
in peaceful ignorance.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.780
Don't worry,
I'll get a big one for you.

03:32.813 --> 03:33.781
You're gonna like it.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.182
Hey, hey, bird.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.216
I'll get him out.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.217
Hold on there.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.218
You're gonna love
this one here.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.620
I got him, I got him.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.522
Bryan, I can't do this.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.056
Before I saw these
noble creatures,

03:43.090 --> 03:44.392
I thought of them as meat,

03:44.425 --> 03:47.227
but now, looking in their
eyes, I see their spirit.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.197
Oh, this, this, this one here--
you got him?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.632
All right, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

03:51.665 --> 03:54.201
These turkeys are getting a
last-minute pardon from the
governor.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.103
That's me and her--
we are the governor.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.371
We're buying them all.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.273
Oh, perfect, take
me and my daughter

03:59.307 --> 04:00.908
not five minutes to
kill the whole batch.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.209
No, no, we don't want
to kill them.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.210
We want to liberate them.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.279
These evil bastards aren't pets.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.648
These are the devil's peacocks.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.550
Sir, I was raised
in the Midwest, okay?

04:09.583 --> 04:11.218
I know a thing or two
about turkeys.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
And my Range Rover has
heated leather seats,

04:13.120 --> 04:15.656
so would you say these creatures
are fairly neat?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.392
Let's call that skinny one
Feather Locklear.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.061
And that one by the water bowl
who's drinking itself to death,

04:21.094 --> 04:22.062
Mel Giblets.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.764
(laughter)

04:23.797 --> 04:25.933
Oh, and that one-- Stan.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.536
(laughs)

04:30.103 --> 04:31.104
BRYAN:
Oh, David.

04:31.138 --> 04:32.105
Bryan,

04:32.139 --> 04:33.641
why are there giant
birds defecating

04:33.674 --> 04:34.975
on our lawn furniture?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.076
We couldn't let them die,

04:36.109 --> 04:37.511
so we gave them all
a pardon.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.679
We're keeping them as pets.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.680
And Rocky's going
to take care of them.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.281
Oh, no, Rocky won't.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.650
Well, what are we going
to do with them?

04:42.683 --> 04:44.251
I don't think
we're even zoned for this.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.786
Fresh turkey eggs
every morning.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.820
Turkeys lay eggs, right?

04:46.854 --> 04:48.255
(snorts)
I don't think so.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.390
Aren't they just
boy chickens?

04:50.123 --> 04:52.025
It felt good
to save their lives.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.961
I'll admit it,
you guys did do a good thing.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.763
It shows a lot
of compassion and decency,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.765
which is what this holiday
is all about,

04:57.798 --> 04:59.467
which makes me
feel even guiltier

04:59.500 --> 05:00.534
about the conversation

05:00.568 --> 05:01.735
I had with my mother.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.938
Off to Big Sur for your annual
selfish gay Thanksgiving?

05:04.972 --> 05:05.939
I may turn lesbian

05:05.973 --> 05:07.074
just for an invite.

05:07.107 --> 05:10.544
Actually, Bryan and I are going
to stay home this year,

05:10.578 --> 05:13.313
just the two of us...
and a few friends.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.383
Ah, I see.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.451
I'm sorry, Mom,
we're just gonna keep it small.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.619
I-It's fine.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.488
I'll just cook
a gourmet dinner alone

05:20.521 --> 05:21.889
and not have to share it

05:21.922 --> 05:23.391
with any pesky loved ones,

05:23.424 --> 05:26.660
and my tears will make
a natural brine for the turkey.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.129
Sounds like your mom
was sad.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.298
Maybe you should
invite her, David.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.501
Ah... Shania,
grown-ups talking.

05:33.534 --> 05:34.668
It'll be fun.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.804
Everybody could invite
all their family and friends

05:36.837 --> 05:38.406
they've been avoiding
and pardon them,

05:38.439 --> 05:40.140
just like Bryan and I did
with the turkeys.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.643
Oh, my mom is on a Baltic
cruise that I paid for,

05:42.676 --> 05:43.811
so she can't make it.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.646
You know, Bryan, we've
got a kid coming.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.481
The holidays aren't
just about us anymore.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.483
I think I've got to invite
my mom to Thanksgiving.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.250
They say

05:50.283 --> 05:51.251
"In giving we receive

05:51.284 --> 05:52.653
and in forgiving
we are forgiven."

05:52.686 --> 05:54.855
You're so smart, sweetie,
but don't you ever want

05:54.888 --> 05:57.591
to just pick your nose
and watch cartoons, hey?

05:57.625 --> 05:58.759
Juice box?
Yes, please.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.261
You know, I really need
to stop freezing out my Clint

06:01.294 --> 06:02.930
just because he voted
for Romney.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.932
I mean, so did
the lead singer of Creed,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.700
and we still get
our hair done together.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.001
Yeah, and

06:08.035 --> 06:09.503
if I'm really starting a new
life here,

06:09.537 --> 06:11.872
I can't hold onto the bitterness
of my old one.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.373
I'm going to
invite your dad.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.274
Oh, God.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.509
Well, I suppose I have
to forgive your nana

06:15.543 --> 06:17.678
for releasing
that embarrassing video of me

06:17.711 --> 06:19.046
and for calling me
a queen.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.048
And fairy.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.350
Fudgie the Whale,
Perry Homo,

06:23.383 --> 06:24.284
Super-Mary-
gayalicious-

06:24.317 --> 06:25.686
sex-fiend-
Elton-boy-kiss,

06:25.719 --> 06:27.354
which I have admittedly
taken as my own.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.023
So it's, uh,
Nana, Clay,

06:30.057 --> 06:33.026
uh, Rocky's brother,
and David's mother.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.062
And one more-- my dad.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.197
He's the one I really
have to forgive.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.532
You know, I've had
such a hard time

06:38.566 --> 06:39.967
letting go of him
cheating on my mom.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.035
If I invite her, I
have to invite him.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.537
David, your parents have not
been in the same room

06:43.571 --> 06:44.538
since Hurricane Katrina,

06:44.572 --> 06:46.874
which was arguably
less of a disaster.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.109
One day our kid will be
mad at me for something,

06:49.142 --> 06:50.210
and it would
break my heart

06:50.243 --> 06:52.412
if he or she shut me
out because of it.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.383
Then it's settled-- we'll
start a whole new tradition.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.919
Thanksgiving
without killing animals

06:58.952 --> 07:01.388
and inviting everyone
that means a lot to us,

07:01.421 --> 07:04.592
no matter how much
we may want to kill them.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.261
Oh, hello there,
you adorable little cutie.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.163
It's your future grandmommy.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.233
I'm making cranberry gelée
with dark sweet cherries,

07:13.266 --> 07:15.068
marsala wine, and rosemary.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.403
It's orgasmic.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.672
That means "delicious"
in French.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.908
Hey, kiddo,
I'm your granddad-to-be Marty,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.309
but you can just call me Marty.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.777
Everybody else does.

07:23.811 --> 07:28.115
So I brought a tasty pear
and toasted walnut salad

07:28.148 --> 07:32.019
and seven years of bottled-up
rage for my ex-wife Frances.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.020
(chuckles)

07:33.053 --> 07:34.922
Got your nose.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.424
Hey, I'm Clay, Shania's dad.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.027
I've been really busy
getting my headshots taken

07:40.060 --> 07:41.294
for my acting career.

07:44.732 --> 07:50.003
I didn't cook anything,
but I, I got some candied yams

07:50.037 --> 07:51.639
and then I ate most of 'em
on the way here

07:51.672 --> 07:54.875
'cause they were so good.

07:54.908 --> 07:55.876
(whistle blows on television)

07:55.909 --> 07:57.044
Oh, no!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.112
Hey, baby,
it's your Godmama Rocky

07:59.146 --> 08:00.648
and this is
my brother Clint.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.715
He's your god-uncle--

08:01.749 --> 08:02.716
technically
your half-god-uncle.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.717
Hey.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.218
We brought a whole bunch
of food to keep

08:05.252 --> 08:07.955
the southern black family
Thanksgiving tradition alive.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.122
Tell 'em
what we got, Clint.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.625
We've got mac and
cheese, red beans,

08:11.659 --> 08:13.293
cornbread, mashed potatoes.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.296
And a whole bunch of gravy
to smother it all.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.632
Gravy comes from meat.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.133
Now, see, that's
your other godmama.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.669
You decide
who's more fun.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.337
Hello, um,
I'm Mrs. Jane Forrest,

08:24.371 --> 08:27.074
the life of every party
and the last real American,

08:27.107 --> 08:28.508
along with Newt Gingrich.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.143
I am so sorry

08:30.177 --> 08:32.479
you are being born
into this world of hell,

08:32.512 --> 08:34.014
but we have to
believe it is

08:34.047 --> 08:35.348
what God intended.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.750
Happy Thanksgiving.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.986
Pumpkin spice pie.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.354
Thank you,
that was lovely, Jane.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.825
Are you sure we're
ready for this?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.027
Yeah, I'm sure it'll be just
like the first Thanksgiving.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.863
It'll end in a massacre and half
the guests will get smallpox.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.200
To the top.

08:53.233 --> 08:54.702
Might not be able to
get any more later.

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
Yo, you want
some beer, man?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.039
It's gonna be great.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.774
Who's hungry?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.049
Come see the turkeys.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.419
They did a good job
with the house.

09:12.452 --> 09:13.420
They're gay.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.923
So the whole thing
is made out of tofu?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.124
Yeah, it's a tofurkey.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.892
Actually looks
like the real thing.
Yeah, well,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.594
tofu is like an
aging diva's face.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.429
You can shape it
into almost anything,

09:22.462 --> 09:24.765
but nobody's really
that excited to see it.

09:24.798 --> 09:27.067
Your parents look like
they're getting along.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.068
Yeah, I know, right?

09:28.101 --> 09:30.137
Hey, hey.
It's amazing.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.740
(chuckles)

09:32.773 --> 09:33.941
(sighs)

09:33.974 --> 09:35.242
Sit up.

09:35.275 --> 09:37.911
Looks like your chin and your
gut are in a race to the floor.

09:37.945 --> 09:41.081
Ugh, that voice-- it's
like a dolphin being impaled.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.752
(grunts)

09:44.785 --> 09:45.786
(laughs)

09:45.819 --> 09:47.587
(squawking)

09:47.621 --> 09:50.457
So, like, what part is
the, is the drumstick?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.125
It's not the neck, right?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.794
No, the drumstick
is part of their leg.

09:53.827 --> 09:56.429
The neck is the neck.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.999
And do turkeys have nuggets,
or is that just chickens?

09:59.032 --> 10:02.169
Wait, honey, let your dad
figure this one out himself.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.503
Okay?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.476
Hey, happy
Thanksgiving.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.311
Yeah, you, too.
Ooh.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.446
Sorry.
It's a little weird, huh?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.015
The part where you're pregnant
with these guys' baby

10:15.048 --> 10:16.684
or the part where your
ex-husband's here?

10:16.717 --> 10:18.686
Uh, the part where
we've been on two dates

10:18.719 --> 10:20.353
and can't talk about it.

10:22.322 --> 10:25.659
Clint, I like you, um,
but I know how important

10:25.693 --> 10:26.860
this meal is
to Bryan and David,

10:26.894 --> 10:28.862
and I just don't want
to ruffle any feathers.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.831
(both laugh)

10:30.864 --> 10:32.700
That's a turkey joke.
It's funny.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.669
Um, I don't think
Clay is ready

10:35.703 --> 10:37.370
to hear
that I'm dating someone.

10:37.404 --> 10:39.673
You told me how many
times he cheated on you.
Yeah, but

10:39.707 --> 10:42.209
he's still
Shania's dad, and

10:42.242 --> 10:43.476
I never want
to put him

10:43.510 --> 10:44.978
in a position where
he's embarrassed

10:45.012 --> 10:46.213
or hurt in front
of his daughter.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.681
You're sure that's
the only reason?

10:47.715 --> 10:49.349
Yes.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.520
Are you out of your mind?

10:53.553 --> 10:56.156
Making moves on the woman
that is growing my boss' baby?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.157
I can't help it.

10:57.190 --> 10:59.026
I like her.
Like her?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.361
What could there possibly be
in that for you?

11:01.394 --> 11:03.363
Unless you're one
of those weirdoes

11:03.396 --> 11:04.564
with a lactating-moms fetish.

11:04.597 --> 11:05.565
It doesn't matter to me

11:05.598 --> 11:06.700
whether she's
pregnant or not.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.868
Goldie's great.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.169
ROCKY:
God! So let's see.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.204
I have the height,
the singing voice,

11:11.238 --> 11:13.173
and the brains in this family.

11:13.206 --> 11:14.407
(scoffs)

11:14.441 --> 11:16.877
Let's watch
some football.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.478
Did I just hear you right?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.413
Are your brother and
Goldie sneaking around?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.049
Don't shoot the messenger,
Crazy Pants.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.051
I'm sure he's used to
dating pregnant women.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.519
But not this one.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.688
So keeping on track with
this whole pardon theme,

11:28.722 --> 11:30.057
I should probably
forgive you

11:30.090 --> 11:32.159
for being the
most handsome,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.894
perfect fiancé a
man could have.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.530
And I should forgive you
for waiting until

11:37.564 --> 11:40.533
after your third glass
of wine to realize that.

11:40.567 --> 11:41.902
(laughing)

11:41.935 --> 11:44.371
Uh, you know,
when you two are finished

11:44.404 --> 11:45.939
punching your ticket to hell,

11:45.973 --> 11:48.241
can someone give me
an ETA on the turkey?

11:48.275 --> 11:49.509
The sooner we eat,

11:49.542 --> 11:51.544
the sooner I get to go back
to my hotel room,

11:51.578 --> 11:54.447
peel off my pantyhose and watch
a Sandra Bullock movie.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.715
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Forrest,

11:55.749 --> 11:57.918
but we will not be serving
any meat this year.

11:57.951 --> 11:59.920
What? What the hell
are you guys talking about?

11:59.953 --> 12:01.521
Well, it was
important for Shania

12:01.554 --> 12:02.790
to have a vegetarian
Thanksgiving.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.292
No meat? Thanksgiving is meat.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.561
Thanksgiving is family,
flesh and blood, gathered around

12:08.595 --> 12:11.131
a table, eating
flesh and blood.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.565
Can I buy you
another drink here?

12:12.599 --> 12:14.734
Okay, let-let me
get this straight.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.804
I am standing here
with two gays

12:16.837 --> 12:20.473
who are telling me that I can't
eat meat while a black boy

12:20.507 --> 12:22.642
has decided that
this Thanksgiving,

12:22.675 --> 12:25.578
he's going to get himself a nice
juicy piece of white meat.

12:25.612 --> 12:28.115
Oh, God, Nana, please stop.
You're acting crazy.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.617
I am the only
sane one here!

12:30.650 --> 12:33.987
But this?! No turkey
on Thanksgiving?!

12:34.021 --> 12:35.823
This is where I draw the line.

12:35.856 --> 12:40.727
You see, you cannot pick and
choose the traditions you like.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.463
That is not the way
this country works.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.432
Why don't you just
go wipe your sore bottoms

12:45.465 --> 12:47.467
with the American flag
while you're at it?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.137
This is what your family
looks like now!

12:50.170 --> 12:51.638
Nobody wants you
here less than me,

12:51.671 --> 12:53.773
but I was the one who
suggested we invite you.

12:53.807 --> 12:55.508
I was the one who
extended the olive branch,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.310
because it was for
the good of my family,

12:57.344 --> 12:58.478
because that

12:58.511 --> 13:00.313
is what the true spirit of
Thanksgiving is about.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.349
So why don't you sit
down, have a drink

13:02.382 --> 13:04.517
and shut your pumpkin pie hole?!

13:15.028 --> 13:16.997
(sighs)

13:17.030 --> 13:19.332
It's not so bad.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.969
You're gonna love
my grandma's okra.

13:23.536 --> 13:26.173
Screw your grandma.
I'm having turkey.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.575
Now, where do think
the gays keep the axe?

13:31.744 --> 13:34.014
Here you go, Dad.
Oh, hey. Thanks.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.683
You know, I didn't know that
you boys knew Bette Midler.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.985
Oh, yeah. She, uh...

13:38.018 --> 13:40.687
She did a couple episodes
of Bryan's show.
Mm?

13:40.720 --> 13:42.689
She's also the voice
of our outgoing message.

13:42.722 --> 13:45.058
Ah. I always thought
that was Bryan.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.360
You know, I'm...

13:47.394 --> 13:48.728
I'm really proud
of you, son.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.830
The life that you've built
here with your partner,

13:50.864 --> 13:54.201
the baby on the way-- it's
amazing stuff. Amazing.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.568
There you are, David.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.204
I can't find
your serving spoons.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.571
Oh, yeah.
I'll-I'll get them for you.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.739
Franny, look at this.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.374
It's the boys
and Bette Midler.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.010
Huh?
How about that!

14:03.043 --> 14:05.879
(laughs)
Where did we see her
that time? Atlantic City?

14:05.913 --> 14:08.048
Yeah, yeah, that was
a fun night, wasn't it?

14:08.081 --> 14:09.549
Oh.
Oh, God.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.252
FRANCES:
I saw you when I walked
into your office that day.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.720
Your hand was on her ass!

14:13.753 --> 14:16.556
Hey, Mom, did you need them for
salad? Because we have tongs.

14:16.589 --> 14:17.724
FRANCES:
Oh, so now her ass

14:17.757 --> 14:19.059
needed a pair of glasses.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.028
Doesn't make any difference
what I have to say,

14:21.061 --> 14:22.729
'cause you've always got
your own little story

14:22.762 --> 14:23.897
going on.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.399
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell is this?!

14:26.433 --> 14:27.767
Oh, your mother's
at it again,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.103
accusing me of cheating on
her when we were married.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.205
Who goes to a ophthalmology
conference in Philadelphia

14:32.239 --> 14:33.706
and stays an extra two days?

14:33.740 --> 14:35.075
There were meetings!

14:35.108 --> 14:36.676
I leave the room
for three seconds.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.711
How did you go from Bette Midler
to Philadelphia?

14:38.745 --> 14:39.913
Bette Midler was in Beaches.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.548
With Barbara Hershey.
Hershey.

14:42.249 --> 14:43.383
Hershey, Pennsylvania!

14:43.416 --> 14:44.918
Oh, my God.
You guys are insane.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.619
I invite you
into our home

14:46.653 --> 14:48.255
for Thanksgiving.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.622
It's the first time we've been
together since the divorce.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.091
And you have to
go at each other?

14:51.124 --> 14:53.593
You couldn't just fake it?
For one day?

14:53.626 --> 14:54.962
For the sake of the baby?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.263
We spent the whole day
trying to fake it.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.897
We just couldn't do it.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.033
Let's face it. We spent years
faking it for the baby.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.434
Only, back then,
the baby was you.

15:03.170 --> 15:06.439
I need to go find
those spoons.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.309
I'll get a drink.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.446
Here, turkey turkey.

15:13.480 --> 15:17.484
Come on, turkeys. Come on!

15:17.517 --> 15:18.718
(kissing sounds)
MARTY:
Mmm. Mmm.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.987
FRANCES:
Mmm.
Mmm.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.621
FRANCES:
Ah, should we go
somewhere else?

15:21.654 --> 15:23.390
Well, let's just
get it over with.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.824
Good idea.
Then we can eat.

15:24.857 --> 15:26.126
Ah!

15:26.159 --> 15:27.460
(cheering on TV)

15:27.494 --> 15:28.928
(laughing)
Right.

15:28.962 --> 15:30.430
That's mine.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.831
Oh, my gosh, that's good.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.166
CLINT:
Is it?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.634
Well, you know...

15:34.667 --> 15:36.269
Whoa!
Hands off my wife, man!

15:36.303 --> 15:37.437
Take it easy, man!
What are you doing?

15:37.470 --> 15:38.805
I see the way you two are,

15:38.838 --> 15:39.973
just pawing at each other.

15:40.007 --> 15:41.308
Right? I'm not blind.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.842
Though sometimes at
night, when I drive,

15:42.875 --> 15:45.145
my right eye gets a little
blurry on the edges.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.313
You should really
get that checked out.

15:46.346 --> 15:47.514
I've been telling
him to do that.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.648
You stop saying stuff
when I'm mad at you,

15:48.681 --> 15:49.649
and keep your
hands off my wife!

15:49.682 --> 15:50.517
Stop it. Oh, my God!

15:50.550 --> 15:51.818
David, you cannot

15:51.851 --> 15:53.987
leave me alone in there
with our nightmarish guests.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.155
Sweet mother!

15:55.188 --> 15:56.823
I am trying very hard right now

15:56.856 --> 15:59.126
to remember Gwyneth Paltrow's
GOOP crisis meditation tips,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.660
but it's hard,
considering

16:00.693 --> 16:01.861
there's live fowl in my den.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.496
What the hell, Shania?!

16:03.530 --> 16:04.864
I had to bring them here.

16:04.897 --> 16:06.299
Nana was going to kill them.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.501
She had an axe,
and she'll use it, Bryan.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.538
I saw her take down
an emu once.
An emu?

16:11.571 --> 16:13.506
When the real estate bubble
burst in '08,

16:13.540 --> 16:16.476
she and her friend Ruth Ann
raised emus for extra cash.

16:16.509 --> 16:19.312
Their meat is surprisingly
low in fat, and their oil is

16:19.346 --> 16:21.681
prized for its
anti-inflammatory properties.

16:21.714 --> 16:22.982
Is the oil anti-aging?

16:23.016 --> 16:24.551
I should get one.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.186
Wait. Weren't
there four birds?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
I had to split 'em up.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.855
They were either
fighting or mating.

16:28.888 --> 16:31.158
I put the other two
in the guest house bathroom.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.825
Oh, we should probably
tell David before he...

16:32.859 --> 16:34.027
DAVID:
What the hell?!

16:34.061 --> 16:36.329
Oh, my... Oh!

16:36.363 --> 16:38.498
You're having sex
in my guest house?!

16:38.531 --> 16:40.033
Well, we were going
to use the bedroom,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.368
but it didn't seem right.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.503
Oh, no, this was definitely
the way to go. Thank you.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.871
You've officially
brought Thanksgiving down

16:44.904 --> 16:46.073
to its lowest point.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.341
(turkeys squawking)

16:48.375 --> 16:49.409
Correction.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.715
Are you all right?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.350
Why is your mother's skirt
tucked into her underpants?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.551
I thought you guys
hated each other.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.387
Look, this is what
we've always done. We fight,

17:00.420 --> 17:01.554
then we fornicate.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.056
FRANCES:
It was our dynamic
for 27 years.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.059
Every day was 23 hours
of torture,

17:06.093 --> 17:07.860
and then 23 minutes of pleasure.

17:07.894 --> 17:08.895
Oh, my God.
23 minutes?

17:08.928 --> 17:09.696
What, are you Sting?

17:09.729 --> 17:10.763
I appreciate that.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.998
I invited you guys here

17:12.031 --> 17:13.700
because I wanted to put
the past behind us,

17:13.733 --> 17:14.701
because I wanted
to be able to have

17:14.734 --> 17:16.002
a normal family Thanksgiving

17:16.035 --> 17:17.204
for when the baby came.

17:17.237 --> 17:18.105
But no matter
how many times

17:18.138 --> 17:19.506
I try to forgive and forget,

17:19.539 --> 17:22.575
you always disappoint me
again and again.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.377
Just like
Renée Zellweger.

17:24.411 --> 17:25.878
I think you guys should go.

17:25.912 --> 17:29.416
All right, I could say,
"I'm sorry I disappointed you."

17:29.449 --> 17:31.284
But you know what?
That's life.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.420
We're your parents,
and we're flawed.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.887
MARTY:
Yeah, like it
or not, kiddo,

17:34.921 --> 17:37.357
it's our flaws which have
made you who you are,

17:37.390 --> 17:39.392
and from I can see,

17:39.426 --> 17:42.095
you've done pretty damn good.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.297
You must be getting your clock
cleaned on property taxes.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.932
Huh?
FRANCES:
Hurry up, Marty.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.700
Did your little
blue pill wear off?

17:47.734 --> 17:50.270
Hey, I'm not holding onto this
pillow 'cause I like chenille.

17:50.303 --> 17:51.638
It's actually brushed suede,

17:51.671 --> 17:53.406
but why don't you keep it
as a parting gift?

17:53.440 --> 17:54.607
Well, that's kind of you.
FRANCES:
Happy Turkey Day, boys.

17:54.641 --> 17:57.076
I'll be back tomorrow
for my casserole dish.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.612
BRYAN:
Okay.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.648
Got your nose.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.619
Well, good riddance!

18:06.653 --> 18:09.956
I saw the whole, craggy,
saggy mess through the window.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.291
(turkeys squawking)

18:11.324 --> 18:14.627
Shh! A scared bird
is not a moist bird.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.929
No! No! No, Jane,
you are not going to kill

18:16.963 --> 18:20.433
the majestic, stupid animals
Shania and I foolishly rescued.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.834
(sighs)
You should go.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.336
You're throwing me out
of your house on Thanksgiving?

18:23.370 --> 18:24.504
Who does that?

18:24.537 --> 18:25.605
It's a new tradition.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.973
Fine.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.975
I'll just go back to my hotel

18:29.008 --> 18:31.344
and celebrate Thanksgiving...
drinking

18:32.345 --> 18:33.646
Yeah?
GOLDIE:
Whoa! Hey!

18:33.680 --> 18:34.681
GOLDIE:
Stop it.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

18:34.714 --> 18:36.483
Stop it. Baby on board.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.152
He started it!
Yeah, 'cause you're
making moves on my wife!

18:39.186 --> 18:40.620
How dare you act like this!

18:40.653 --> 18:42.522
Especially with your daughter
in the next room!

18:42.555 --> 18:44.991
I'm sorry, Goldie.
I want you to leave.

18:45.024 --> 18:48.328
Before pie?
You've already ruined
too many of my Thanksgivings.

18:48.361 --> 18:52.532
(sighs)
Just... go.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.866
I think I'm gonna go, too.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.534
What?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.304
It's not fair if I stay

18:57.337 --> 18:59.172
when we both got into it...
even though he started it.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.007
That's not true.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.675
Okay, Clint, go home.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.313
Okay, I'll see you.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.547
Yeah.
Okay. Oops. Sorry.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.349
Yeah, okay.

19:09.382 --> 19:11.351
I think I broke
my bad-word finger.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.186
Dude, that's your
index finger.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.823
Oh, man, I've punched a lot
of people for pointing up.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.491
I know you guys feel bad

19:18.525 --> 19:20.860
about your Thanksgiving
getting ruined and everything,

19:20.893 --> 19:22.562
but I like it just being us.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.364
Mm. Yeah.
Mm. Me, too.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.333
The only other person I would
want here, besides Patti LuPone

19:26.366 --> 19:28.034
is our baby.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.569
GOLDIE:
Who is right here

19:29.602 --> 19:31.538
and excited to try tofurkey.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.072
ALL:
Mmm.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.874
Maybe we should rethink
this holiday.

19:34.907 --> 19:36.243
I think we
should save

19:36.276 --> 19:39.546
Thanksgiving for us,
and save Christmas

19:39.579 --> 19:42.415
for all of our damaged,
inappropriate relatives.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.351
Who pull out axes or their fists

19:44.384 --> 19:46.719
or their private parts
with equal abandon.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.521
Yeah. Family is
who you choose.

19:48.555 --> 19:51.190
It's the relatives
who are chosen for us.

19:51.224 --> 19:55.895
So, Thanksgiving is for family,
and Christmas is for relatives.

19:55.928 --> 19:57.864
I like it.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.866
Let's dig in.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.234
Let me see.

20:01.268 --> 20:01.901
Mmm.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.570
Oh.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.537
Yum, yum.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.405
Oh.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.573
(all grunting)

20:06.606 --> 20:07.874
Oh, God.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.041
Tastes like pollution.

20:09.075 --> 20:09.909
How about a pizza?

20:09.942 --> 20:10.610
How about five?

20:10.643 --> 20:11.411
What do you guys want on it?

20:11.444 --> 20:12.245
Meat.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.680
You know what?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.081
Maybe let's keep with the
vegetarian theme for Shania.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.083
Yes. And...

20:17.116 --> 20:20.953
to save the lives of all
those innocent pepperonis.

20:20.987 --> 20:23.756
(sighs)

20:23.790 --> 20:26.293
Hi. Yes. I'd like
to order some pizza.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.728
Five larges, please.

20:28.761 --> 20:31.097
Nothing, nothing.
Yeah, I'll take
some breadsticks.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.265
Salad? Do you
want salad?

20:32.299 --> 20:33.833
Okay.
Who wants salad?

20:38.638 --> 20:40.440
So, is there anything else
I need to know before

20:40.473 --> 20:42.809
you go to school?
Well, it's
pretty straightforward.

20:42.842 --> 20:43.943
Feather Locklear
has a wheat allergy.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.378
Mel Giblets really likes it

20:45.412 --> 20:46.813
when you tickle his wattle.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.748
It puts him right to sleep.

20:48.781 --> 20:52.151
Oh, don't forget to turn on
Judge Joe Brown at 1:30.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.287
It's Stan's
favorite.
Hmm.

20:54.321 --> 20:56.255
And I left the satellite radio
on Smooth Jazz

20:56.289 --> 20:58.958
because it helps Eddie Gizzard
with his anxiety.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.893
Oh.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.629
Oh, and do yourself a favor.

21:02.662 --> 21:04.297
Do no make tea.

21:04.331 --> 21:08.668
When the kettle starts
to whistle, they will attack.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.903
Got it.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.905
Have fun now
'cause you're gonna make

21:12.939 --> 21:15.542
a delicious Christmas dinner.

21:20.813 --> 21:23.450
