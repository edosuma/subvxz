00:00.830 --> 00:01.940
I'm hank.

00:01.990 --> 00:05.820
I was your typicalemergency room doctor until I got fired.

00:05.860 --> 00:09.170
You let a billionairehospital trustee die to save some kidoff the street.

00:09.190 --> 00:11.170
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:11.260 --> 00:14.020
- This is my brother.
- I'm evan R. Lawson,cpa.

00:14.050 --> 00:17.580
He took me awayfrom my troubles and to the hamptons.

00:17.930 --> 00:21.380
And suddenly I had a chance to becomea whole new kind of doctor.

00:21.430 --> 00:25.660
Turns out the wealthyand not-so-wealthy out here could use a guywho makes house calls.

00:25.980 --> 00:29.740
So I got a second chanceto do what I do best.

00:47.410 --> 00:50.080
Uh,I'm sorry,you're offering me a job?

00:50.140 --> 00:53.190
Almost.The official offer will come from our E.R.Department.

00:53.270 --> 00:56.510
But there's an opening,and you're our first choice.

00:56.610 --> 00:58.980
I-I did not expect thattonight.

00:59.130 --> 01:01.540
Um,yeah,I guessI need to think about it.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.230
Oh,no,totally.I mean,it could be...

01:03.290 --> 01:04.739
a great opportunity.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.240
- For hamptons heritage.
- Or not.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.110
My reputation might precede me.

01:08.180 --> 01:12.390
You know,the last hospitaladministrator who hired me lived to regret it.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.340
I'm not scared.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.320
- Wait.
- What?

01:16.660 --> 01:18.700
Your phone.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.040
It hasn't rung yet.

01:20.120 --> 01:21.940
Oh,yeah,yeah,yeah,we have a new system.

01:22.010 --> 01:28.250
All hankmed callsare forwarded to evan or divya when I'm busyenjoying myself like I am tonight.

01:28.590 --> 01:30.700
- Here's to technology.
- Okay.

01:34.750 --> 01:37.310
You know,this place used to bean old family diner.

01:38.380 --> 01:41.340
I came here for milkshakesafter band practice.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.270
Now it's uranium shakesafter work.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.730
So what did you--what did you play?

01:46.810 --> 01:48.760
In--in band,what did you--

01:50.710 --> 01:51.910
um... glockenspiel.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.980
I am sorry.Did you just say glockenspiel?

01:54.040 --> 01:55.500
- Sexy,right?
- Yeah.Hot.

01:55.570 --> 01:57.050
My mother insisted.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.530
She playedwhen she was in school.

01:58.560 --> 01:59.850
A glockenspiel dynasty.

01:59.940 --> 02:02.610
I was the black sheep.Believe me.

02:02.730 --> 02:05.260
So you settledfor medicine.

02:05.570 --> 02:07.760
And that's pretty muchmy story.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.240
It's a good story.

02:09.310 --> 02:11.300
Thank you.

02:11.700 --> 02:15.430
So now what?

02:23.620 --> 02:24.870
Really?

02:24.990 --> 02:26.160
Glockenspiel?

02:36.040 --> 02:39.400
call me ishmael.Call me the rainmaker.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.210
Call me-- the proudest brotheron earth.

02:42.340 --> 02:43.240
- Oh,my god.
- Get out,evan.

02:43.320 --> 02:44.410
No,you got to hearmy news first.

02:44.470 --> 02:46.300
I just landed us a whale,hank.Like a whale.

02:46.350 --> 02:47.490
I can't believeyou're still here.

02:47.590 --> 02:49.080
- Okay,fine,I'll be in my room.
- Okay.

02:49.140 --> 02:50.880
Okay,I'll be in my room!

02:51.330 --> 02:53.370
- Singing in all the rainI've made.
- Don'T.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.860
And that's pretty muchmy story.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.460
I-I do have an early daytomorrow.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.400
Right.We'll get it right next time.

03:06.460 --> 03:07.810
Yeah,yeah.

03:07.890 --> 03:09.760
Whenever that is.

03:09.850 --> 03:12.210
- No rush.How's tomorrow night?
- Perfect.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.420
- I'm thinking your place.
- Okay.

03:20.860 --> 03:24.060
So this guy rob millersays he's svp of r&d at grant limited.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.700
So I say,"like,what,you're in nano technology?

03:25.730 --> 03:26.900
"  I can't believeyou didn't even knock.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.410
He goes,"nano technology?That's,like,so 20 years ago.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.780
"And I'm like,what?Like,how sexually arousingis that?

03:31.880 --> 03:35.070
And then you just keptstanding there,like a bellhop waitingfor a tip.

03:35.130 --> 03:37.700
Oh,oh,and the patientis rob's wife claire grant,

03:37.780 --> 03:40.340
who's the evpof digital marketing at grant.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.530
She's the evp,and she's pregnant,right?

03:42.600 --> 03:44.890
Just a total violationof my privacy.

03:44.950 --> 03:46.850
The grants,that's like one of america's richest families.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.040
Like,it's old money,it's new money.It's money of all ages.

03:49.070 --> 03:52.250
- Jill and I were finallygonna,you know... at least I think we were.
- This is really gonna puthankmed on the map.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.670
Oh,and you know whereon the map exactly,by the way?

03:54.740 --> 03:55.910
What?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.840
- What are you talking about?
- Grant's island.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.810
Yeah,as in the familyhas their own.

03:59.850 --> 04:01.040
It's hundreds of acres.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.850
It's 360 degreesof exclusivity.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.430
Just a 15-minute copter rideaway.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.940
They probably staff itwith robots.

04:07.020 --> 04:09.810
It's probably staffedwith really smoking hot,sexy robots.

04:09.900 --> 04:12.310
Are you readyfor the weekend I've basically just been waiting formy entire life?

04:12.370 --> 04:13.940
I have planswith jill tonight.

04:13.990 --> 04:16.630
Take a rain check.Here,as rainmaker,I'll issue you one.

04:16.670 --> 04:20.390
My god,this is goingto be a gigantic gig for us,and we needed a getawayanyways.Perfect.

04:20.480 --> 04:23.590
We're in the hamptons.This is the getaway,remember?

04:23.920 --> 04:25.000
Have a good trip.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.380
Mr.Miller's wife is threeweeks from her due date.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.310
No complications.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.300
Claire organizes this weekend every yearwith her sister.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.380
They spent summerson the island growing up.

04:35.430 --> 04:37.320
It's one of the few thingsthey share in common.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.790
I've been trying to talk claireout of it this year,but you can't arguewith a grant.

04:40.850 --> 04:42.590
That would be un-american,right?

04:43.170 --> 04:45.990
So you areour last-minute compromise.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.020
I've been called worse.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.760
At hankmed,we aimto compromise,so that's great.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.490
That's the worst businessmantra I've ever heard.

04:52.650 --> 04:54.440
Why are you laughing?

04:54.560 --> 04:57.030
Did I give you the impressionI was hiring a team?

04:57.120 --> 04:59.780
Because claire likesto keep this only family.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.510
Look,she's going withor without you,and I'm at your mercy.

05:04.590 --> 05:08.160
So,please,dr.Lawson,just give me a number.

05:08.230 --> 05:13.140
Name your price.We both know that,for a price,anything's possible.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.240
Oh,I'm sorry,buddy.

05:19.380 --> 05:20.530
I know you had high hopes.

05:20.610 --> 05:22.430
No,you know,it's completely fine,you know.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.040
The dream can wait.The lifelong dream.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.310
- The nightly fantasy... 
- ev,the guy said,"name your price.

05:26.370 --> 05:28.410
" You should be drooling.

05:28.510 --> 05:30.820
Money isn't everything,hank.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.810
Have fun.

05:35.360 --> 05:37.200
It is a good clientfor hankmed.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.480
And they clearly need you.

05:39.560 --> 05:40.880
You can coveron the mainland?

05:40.960 --> 05:43.830
Light schedule today.Nothing I'm not fully trainedto handle.

05:43.870 --> 05:48.450
And if anything comes up that's above my pay grade,you're a consult away.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.660
I'll be in touch.

05:50.710 --> 05:53.490
It was a bait and switch,claire.You're the onethat said no nanny.

05:53.550 --> 05:58.770
I just thought one weekendof us fending for ourselves and not trippingover our staff would be nice.

05:58.820 --> 06:00.360
Then why are you bringinga doctor?

06:00.430 --> 06:01.840
Just in caseof emergencies.

06:01.890 --> 06:04.930
When you're a mother,claire,you'll understand that everything is an emergency.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.730
- Ladies,hi,I'm sorry.
- Stop,stop.

06:06.820 --> 06:07.960
I couldn't help overhearing.

06:08.050 --> 06:09.720
Evan R. Lawson,cfo of hankmed.

06:09.820 --> 06:12.430
And--oh,brotherof dr.Lawson here.

06:12.510 --> 06:14.030
Hank.Pleased to meet you.

06:14.070 --> 06:16.720
Oh,hi,so are you coming?

06:16.980 --> 06:18.180
- I am.
- Yeah!

06:18.250 --> 06:22.170
Great.And I was justabout to explain that,while I'm nota professional nanny,

06:22.230 --> 06:24.620
- per se,I am a college graduate...- evan.

06:24.700 --> 06:29.170
With four summersat camp echo,as well as a stintwith big brothers,which was really enlighteningfor me.

06:29.260 --> 06:31.490
Not to mention getting held backin the second grade,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.820
so I have a lot of experienceworking with younger kids.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.310
- No.
- Sold.

06:35.390 --> 06:36.810
Get your bags.

06:36.870 --> 06:38.140
Really?

06:38.210 --> 06:40.240
Uh,okay.

06:41.680 --> 06:42.380
- Safe flight.
- Give me your phone.

06:42.490 --> 06:43.970

- Ciao.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.300
- Bye.
- A nanny.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.710
Don't ever use that word.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.300
- I'm not a nanny.
- I'm a manny.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.030
And look at these kids.They're housebroken,man.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.500
They're practically gonnatake care of themselves,

07:00.640 --> 07:04.040
leaving me time to sign the grantsas hankmed retainees

07:04.100 --> 07:07.440
and enjoy some fun in the sun on a lush refugewith its own zip code.

07:07.490 --> 07:09.450
Everyone aboard.We're off.

07:10.690 --> 07:13.880

07:38.800 --> 07:40.560
Mary who?

07:40.640 --> 07:44.660
Mary... mary poppins has an umbrella.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.220
We're gonna create magictogether.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.040

- Yeah?

07:51.180 --> 07:53.150
I know how muchyour family values its privacy.

07:53.260 --> 07:56.220
I'll try my best not to intrudeon your special weekend.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.800
No,you know,I'm actuallykind of warming to the idea.

07:58.920 --> 08:03.990
In fact having you alongis inspiring me as we speak.

08:04.040 --> 08:04.900
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.630
In what way?

09:09.940 --> 09:12.890

09:15.900 --> 09:18.210
Oh,is that better?Okay?Good?

09:18.260 --> 09:20.540
So I don't want to pressure you.

Oh,no,especially this year.

09:40.970 --> 09:42.600
Oh,this is dr.Lawson.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.650

09:47.740 --> 09:50.240
And this is kevin,lois's nanny.

09:50.330 --> 09:52.030

09:52.110 --> 09:53.790
Pleasure to meet you.I am so excited.

09:53.870 --> 09:56.050
Can't wait to meet the rest of the staff of the island.

You just did.

09:57.790 --> 09:59.020

10:01.000 --> 10:03.660
Hey,you guys want a lift?

10:03.970 --> 10:05.400
Nothing against your truck,will.

10:05.450 --> 10:09.630
I'm sure the suspension was cutting edge in 1951,but it might be a rough ride for claire.

10:09.720 --> 10:10.620
I can walk.It's okay.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.230
Slowly.Very slowly.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.220
Okay,everybody else in the truck.

10:14.310 --> 10:16.030
Hey,arlo,how you doing?

10:16.130 --> 10:18.020
Hey,kids,who wants to ride in the back with me?

10:18.140 --> 10:19.310
- I do!- No.

10:19.370 --> 10:22.320
Okay,all right,well,then,I'll ride in the back.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.250
- Great.- Hold on.

10:29.370 --> 10:31.500
So rob and I completelybonded on the chopper.

10:31.690 --> 10:34.260
Gave him a few really good ideasabout some new software apps.

10:34.360 --> 10:36.020
And I had a nice chatwith claire.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.300
Really?What'd you find out?

10:37.300 --> 10:41.330

10:56.260 --> 10:58.210
Honey,come on,I can't go cold turkey.

10:58.260 --> 10:59.880
There's no signal up hereanyway.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.690
Well,it's not gonna stop you from writing,you know,

11:01.760 --> 11:04.510
emails or memos or emails about memos.

11:04.550 --> 11:05.660
Uh,I'm a little confused.

11:05.770 --> 11:08.040
I thought the grants wereall about technology.

11:08.080 --> 11:11.100
If you really needto speak to someone,will has a sat phone,okay.

11:11.160 --> 11:14.380
I mean,we've becomemore attached to our devices than to each other.

11:14.430 --> 11:18.550
This is the exact opposite of what mom and dad wo--would have wanted.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.860
Some things change,claire.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.210
Well,some things shouldn'T.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.130
Here,you know,let me get that.Take a breath.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.670
You need to relax.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.270
Okay,sis,no tech.

11:27.340 --> 11:31.050
So long as blenders are exempt 'cause I'm not mixingmy margaritas by hand.

11:31.100 --> 11:33.030
So I like that move.

11:33.090 --> 11:35.470
The whole forget the dsin the pocket trick.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.070
I saw that.Nice smuggling operation.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.010
Suffer with the rest of us,kiddo.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.320
Sorry.I'm sorry.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.680
Thanks a lot,kevin.

11:43.780 --> 11:44.790
- You suck.
- Okay,it's evan.

11:44.850 --> 11:47.370
Arlo,trust me,this island is a special place.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.740
Try to enjoy it.

11:48.850 --> 11:50.840
Yeah,it's true.We'll just rough it.

11:50.940 --> 11:54.560
Yeah,maybe we'll find,like,an antique atari in the house and we'll bring it backto life.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.690
There's no tvin the house.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.730
What do you mean,there's no tv?

11:57.860 --> 12:00.970
What do you plugyour blu-ray player into?

12:01.050 --> 12:02.410
I can give you an idea.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.840
You--

12:05.190 --> 12:06.910
there's no tv,hank.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.230
There's no tv.

12:08.250 --> 12:09.980
Like,what are we supposedto do at night?Just sit around and think?

12:10.050 --> 12:11.160
You wanted a getaway.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.210
Well,yeah,not withthe sisters from the shining.

12:13.270 --> 12:14.790
Why do you get to keep yours?

12:14.850 --> 12:16.830
- For medical necessities.
- Like what?

12:16.860 --> 12:20.100
Like breaking dateswith hospital administrators.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.520
I'm not gettinga single bar.

12:24.730 --> 12:27.400
What kind of island is this?

12:30.710 --> 12:32.440
Hey,beautiful.

12:32.610 --> 12:35.420
Do you hear?The board wants a short listby monday.

12:35.490 --> 12:36.780
For the E.R. Position?

12:36.810 --> 12:38.280
Gordon doesn't retirefor a month.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.560
They're nervousabout emergency being short a physician.

12:40.630 --> 12:42.740
What did hank lawson say?

12:42.810 --> 12:44.100
He's thinking about it.

12:44.160 --> 12:46.230
I know about those lawsuits pending against him.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.240
He really shouldn't worryabout that.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.040
We'd be lucky to havea doctor like lawson.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.680
I'll follow up.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.120
Do it soon.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.410
This is our room?

13:03.520 --> 13:05.220
Dibs on top bunk.

13:05.340 --> 13:06.790
Okay.

13:09.430 --> 13:11.760
Oh,these beds remind meof passaic.

13:11.840 --> 13:12.950
Remember that?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.080
Our secret spacehibernation pods.

13:15.150 --> 13:20.880
Oh,you mean the bedswe got 'cause dad lost our houseand we had to move into a crampedtwo-bedroom apartment?

13:21.270 --> 13:24.580
It wasn't an apartment,hank.

13:24.650 --> 13:28.380
It was the intergalacticstarship ranger-3.

13:28.590 --> 13:32.130
And it was awesome.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.960
Yeah,you're right.

13:36.050 --> 13:37.760
My bad.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.730
Your fundal height showsthat you're about ready to go.

13:45.810 --> 13:47.440
Everything looks good.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.330
Oh,I think I just feltyour baby kick.

13:49.380 --> 13:51.200
Great.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.610
Your O.B. Notedno placenta previa.

13:53.680 --> 13:56.850
I do see you havea high frequency of certain antigensin your blood.

13:56.890 --> 13:58.470
Yes,that is a family thing.

13:58.510 --> 13:59.890
We're in a rare blood group.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.640
We grants like to be exclusiveabout everything.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.350
It hasn't causedany problems?

14:04.440 --> 14:06.090
No,none.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.940
So when do we induce?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.810
Claire,we're not inducing.

14:10.870 --> 14:11.800
Why?Why not?

14:11.840 --> 14:14.440
Come on,we both know the 40-week thingis just guesswork.

14:14.460 --> 14:15.430
I mean,look at me.Look at me.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.320
I am full-termand ready to pop.

14:17.350 --> 14:19.110
Yeah,I wouldn't induceeven if I could.

14:19.170 --> 14:21.780
Then why did you bringthe pitocin?

14:21.830 --> 14:25.800
As a precaution,and I hope the kleptomania isn't hereditary as well.

14:25.850 --> 14:28.240
There are other waysto encourage labor,

14:28.260 --> 14:33.730
like hot bathswith evening primrose and various formsof stimulation.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.550
All great for inducingand for your husband when you're back home.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.390
Claire,really.

14:40.500 --> 14:41.540
What is the rush?

14:41.620 --> 14:46.040
On our nightstand,rob and I have a wireless router where our wedding photoused to be.

14:46.110 --> 14:49.490
This year my sister and i exchanged happy birthdaysvia text message.

14:49.610 --> 14:54.200
And I love lois's kids,right,but every oneof their experiences is basically virtual.

14:54.300 --> 14:58.270
They've been denieda connection to the real world and to their family.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.950
My child is gonna havethat connection from the start.

15:01.040 --> 15:07.480
And you will do a great jobof providing it after your baby is born in his or her own time.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.370
Okay?

15:14.250 --> 15:15.290
Yo.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.710
Hey,arlo.Hey,so your uncle rob andthe twins are gathering wood.You want to join?

15:18.830 --> 15:20.090
It's too hot.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.180
Okay.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.800
Uh,you want to hit the beachwith me and cool off?

15:22.850 --> 15:24.110
I hate the beach.

15:24.210 --> 15:27.730
What do you mean,you hate the beach?Come on,the sunny breezes,the cool water,the soft sand?

15:27.800 --> 15:30.260
I don't like sand.It gets in my socks and shoes.

15:30.330 --> 15:32.740
Uh,that's 'cause you'rewearing socks and shoes.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.530
Come on,will can drive us.It'll be fun.

15:34.610 --> 15:35.990
Maybe he'll let you shift.

15:36.090 --> 15:37.550
I don't thinkwill likes me.

15:37.630 --> 15:39.770
What do you mean?How could anyone not like you?

15:39.830 --> 15:41.770
Get in the truck.

15:41.850 --> 15:44.420
Just trust me.It'll be fun.

15:44.550 --> 15:45.530
Yo.

15:45.630 --> 15:49.640
The last few years,I haven't been able to talk himinto doing anything.

15:49.980 --> 15:51.630
You're a good nanny,steven.

15:51.940 --> 15:55.580
I'm a manny,and it's kevin.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.660
Evan.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.910
- Oh,yeah,how about that?
- Yeah,it sounds sweet.

16:01.970 --> 16:04.270
- Yeah.
- See,this isthe original joystick,arlo.

16:04.310 --> 16:06.840
Well,not the original joystick,but,you know.

16:06.900 --> 16:10.060
As far as you're concerned... um,okay,so what's gonna--whoa,whoa.

16:10.180 --> 16:12.010
Calm yourself,little guy.

16:12.090 --> 16:14.070
God,it's a big truck.You got to respect it.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.240
You got to respect it.

16:15.320 --> 16:19.030
When he pushes downon that little clutch lever down there with his foot,

16:19.210 --> 16:21.400
then you're gonna--how doesthis kind of truck work?

16:21.470 --> 16:23.300
Well,it comes towards me and then back.

16:23.390 --> 16:25.250
Up and back,that's first gear.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.870
Okay,you ready?

16:26.940 --> 16:28.520
- Yeah.Okay.
- Let's do it.

16:30.060 --> 16:32.150
All right,can we use a littlemuscle there,big fella?Pull it right back.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.530
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa.That's fine.

16:33.610 --> 16:34.910
A little bit of grinding's fineat first.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.620
- It's completely okay.
- Let's just try it again.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.610
You know what,let's try it again.I'm gonna help youthis time.

16:38.660 --> 16:41.630
This is just like when my dadtaught me how to drive,except he wasn't even there,

16:41.680 --> 16:44.010
and I was 10,and I took out this entirefamily of lawn flamingos.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.990
But let's justdon't tell anyone that.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.210
- Um,you ready?
- Okay.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.130
Let's do this.Up,and then back.

16:49.190 --> 16:51.490
All right. You go.You push.Yes!

16:51.550 --> 16:52.710
- Oh,my god!- Hey,here we go!

16:52.770 --> 16:53.930
You're a natural.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.510
Yeah,hey,not bad,huh?

16:57.430 --> 16:59.640
How could youeven propose that?

16:59.660 --> 17:02.840
Our portfolio's down30% this year,claire.

17:03.910 --> 17:05.339
We barely ever use this place.

17:05.390 --> 17:06.760
And what about will?

17:06.859 --> 17:08.849
Well,what about him?

17:09.040 --> 17:12.010
If you're searchingfor a signal,doc,you're gonna have to swimfor it.

17:12.079 --> 17:13.760
There's no servicein the middle of the ocean.

17:13.839 --> 17:18.960
Oh,I really needto cancel a date and probably order flowers.

17:19.030 --> 17:21.150
Ooh,wife or girlfriend?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.869
Girlfriend,maybe,before I stood her up.

17:23.950 --> 17:25.079
Yeah.

17:25.150 --> 17:27.950
Well,you can ignore me,claire,but we still haveto respond to the offer.

17:28.050 --> 17:29.490
Well,the island'snot for sale.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.240
You know what,you can justuse the satellite phone.It's in will's truck.

17:32.290 --> 17:35.100
Oh,okay,great,thanks.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.470
All right now,second's a little tricky.

17:37.550 --> 17:39.600
Yeah,don't messwith second.All right,you ready?

17:39.660 --> 17:40.790
No,I want to do it alone.

17:40.870 --> 17:43.480
Well,we should--okay,all right.Only when he says,though.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.760
Okay,well,be careful.Okay.

17:48.190 --> 17:50.600
Ditch!Look out for the ditch!

17:52.010 --> 17:54.090
Oh,my god,what is that?

17:54.310 --> 17:55.860
- You okay?
- Just jump down.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.850
Are you okay,arlo?Anything hurt?

17:59.900 --> 18:01.540
I told youI didn't want to go.

18:01.610 --> 18:02.910
How about you?

18:04.080 --> 18:05.220

How you doing?You okay?

18:06.130 --> 18:07.970
Oh,yeah,no,I'm fine.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.060
Yeah.

18:09.170 --> 18:11.570
Wish I could saythe same for the truck.

18:11.650 --> 18:12.750
And the phone.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.720
Well,that sucks.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.360
- And your leg.
- Oh,my god!

18:16.480 --> 18:17.600
Don't put any pressureon it,okay?

18:17.660 --> 18:19.080
- Why would I?
- Come here.Turn around.

18:19.150 --> 18:21.850

- Let's go,guys.Get his back.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.450

18:23.510 --> 18:24.860
Okay,let him down gently.

18:28.780 --> 18:32.510
Easy. Easy.

18:32.630 --> 18:34.130
Okay. It's okay.

18:34.240 --> 18:35.980
It's just your bone.

18:36.060 --> 18:38.010
Just my bone?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.770
Clear the table.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.190
I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

18:49.660 --> 18:51.530
It's a compound fracture.

18:54.670 --> 18:56.170
Irrigating the wound.

18:58.340 --> 18:59.270
Okay,okay.

Okay,it's lined up.

19:08.220 --> 19:09.450
Antacid and sugar.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.420
To prevent infection.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.040
What is that?What is that?

19:13.290 --> 19:15.410
All right,so unfold the towels.

19:15.460 --> 19:17.350
Unscrew the malletlike this.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.870

19:19.920 --> 19:21.960
Hold those close together.I want youto hold the toe right there.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.810

Okay,okay.

19:48.710 --> 19:51.050

19:51.190 --> 19:52.760
You're supposedto be the patient.

19:52.820 --> 19:55.290
Well,now you'remy patient too.

19:55.390 --> 19:57.190
Are you on any medications?

19:57.270 --> 19:59.200
Uh,yeah.There's a list in my pocket.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.010
Oh,I got it,I got it.

20:00.090 --> 20:01.900
- The pills are all in my room.- I'll get 'em.

20:02.390 --> 20:04.660
Great,but slow down.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.300
You gonna send meto a hospital?

20:06.360 --> 20:07.830
As soonas the chopper returns.

20:07.920 --> 20:10.830
About your truck,I know my brotherwas the one--  it wasn't kevin's fault.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.120
It's evan--never mind.

20:12.190 --> 20:14.860
But,arlo,aw,that poor kid.

20:14.940 --> 20:17.300
One screw-up after another.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.510
Now he won't talk to you,won't look at you.

20:19.590 --> 20:23.120
Makes you worryhow he'll grow up,get by in the world.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.090
Every family has one.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.950
Now take it easy,okay?

20:39.040 --> 20:40.220
Okay.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.470
The doctor will follow upnext week.

20:50.420 --> 20:53.580
****

20:56.320 --> 20:58.720
Do you knowif someone paged hankmed?

20:58.850 --> 21:00.510
Divya?

21:00.630 --> 21:02.150
Hank's P.A.,Right?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.940
Jill,hank's friend.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.150
Right?Right.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.270
What are you doing here?

21:06.320 --> 21:08.420
Oh,I'm coveringfor hank.

21:08.920 --> 21:12.720
Wait,hank asked youto cover this?

21:14.640 --> 21:16.780
I think there's beena miscommunication.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.850
I'm sure hank will give youa call when he gets back--

21:20.940 --> 21:23.530
if you had an appointmentor something.

21:23.590 --> 21:25.170
Yeah,we had a something.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.590
When he gets backfrom where?

21:26.640 --> 21:27.490
Well,he left town.

21:27.550 --> 21:28.780
He left?Why?

21:28.830 --> 21:31.080
Well,I'm reallynot at liberty to say.

21:31.440 --> 21:35.280
Hey,gorgeous,look at youin civvies.

21:35.340 --> 21:37.450
Quite a treat.

21:37.710 --> 21:38.710
Dan irving.

21:38.770 --> 21:40.470
Attending physicianin jill's E.R.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.130
Divya katdare,hankmed.

21:42.270 --> 21:45.280
- We are a profess-- oh,I know all about hankmed.

21:45.330 --> 21:46.480
Yeah,great.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.820
Hey,don't let meinterrupt this.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.610
No,this isn't--

21:49.680 --> 21:53.990
tell dr.Lawsonhe can call me directly if he has any questionsabout the position.

21:54.080 --> 21:57.450
Oh,and you can call meabout anything.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.890
Hank was offered a positionat hamptons heritage?

22:03.890 --> 22:07.310
I'm really not at libertyto say.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.120
Can you really get itto work?

22:16.110 --> 22:18.540
No blow dryers.It's a common but fatal mistake.

22:18.540 --> 22:21.330
You want suction,not heat.You got a dust buster?

22:21.330 --> 22:23.320
Claire probably prefersthe broom.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.490
Okay,anything that sucks.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.090
You seempretty tech-savvy there.

22:27.090 --> 22:32.780
Well,you know,I've dropped phones in pools and toilets... the occasional mojito.

22:32.780 --> 22:35.280
Hot tubs,koi ponds,and a volcano.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.980
So that battery is toast,huh?

22:36.980 --> 22:40.860
Well,yes,but if we drythe handset out,we can use the charger.

22:40.860 --> 22:43.720
Because the charger works without the battery.Shouldn't you know all this?

22:43.720 --> 22:46.180
Nah,the stuff I deal withis all next-gen.

22:46.180 --> 22:48.560
It doesn't even need batteries.

22:48.560 --> 22:52.890
That sounds very lucrative.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.430
It's hank.Please leave a message.

23:17.300 --> 23:21.070
Um,sorry I missed you tonight.

23:21.070 --> 23:26.250
Uh,maybeyour phone died... although you do seem to bein touch with your assistant.

23:26.250 --> 23:30.460
Anyway,uh,nowthat you've slept on it,I need to know how you feel.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.010
About the job.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.500
Not us.

23:33.500 --> 23:36.080
Not that there even is an us.Yet.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.660
And not thatI'm not open to it.

23:37.660 --> 23:40.480
And I'm totally coolwith taking things one step at a time.

23:40.480 --> 23:45.070
And either way,that has nothing to do with the job offer.

23:45.070 --> 23:46.690
Unless,of course,that's what's freaking you out.

23:46.690 --> 23:51.010
And if it is,I would totally understand because...I sound crazy.

23:51.490 --> 23:53.630
All right.

23:53.630 --> 23:58.330
Let's delete,regroup,and start over.

23:58.330 --> 24:00.960
Your message has been sentand marked urgent.

24:00.960 --> 24:04.750
No.N-n-no.Oh,my god.

24:04.750 --> 24:09.440
* She'll be coming aroundthe mountain when she comes *  

24:09.440 --> 24:11.800
yo,how's your patient?

24:11.800 --> 24:16.540
For an old guywith a compound fracture,high risk of osteomyelitis and/or a fatal embolism,

24:16.540 --> 24:18.790
he's surprisingly stable.

24:18.790 --> 24:20.010
How's yours?

24:20.010 --> 24:23.810
I pounded on it,I screamed,like,"don't quit on me!Don't you quit on me!

24:23.810 --> 24:25.480
" But then it just quit on meanyway.

24:25.480 --> 24:29.760
Look,if we can callfor evac and not just wait for their chopper,I'll breathe a lot easier.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.080
Then I shall breathe lifeinto that phone.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.710
- Are you cooking pasta?
- Saline.

24:35.710 --> 24:39.180
See,this is what happens when all you watchis the health network and the food channel.You get confused.

24:39.180 --> 24:43.320
Hasn't been on the med schoolcurriculum since 1850,so I'm ballparkingthe proportions.

24:43.320 --> 24:44.840
All right,well,good luck with that.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.570
What were you thinking,evan?

24:46.570 --> 24:49.120
Letting a 12-year-old drive?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.230
Mannies need to empowerthe lads in their charge.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.840
It stifles anarchy.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.160
He was just shifting.So what?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.950
So we're stuckon a remote island with an injured senior,

24:56.950 --> 24:59.810
a woman intenton inducing herself,and no phone service.

24:59.810 --> 25:04.520
Or we're stuckon an amazing island where,yes,an accident happened,

25:04.520 --> 25:08.370
but a skilled physician and his charismatic brotherwill save the day,

25:08.370 --> 25:10.830
give a mother-to-besome much-needed family time,

25:10.830 --> 25:12.690
and cement a futurewith long-term clients.

25:12.690 --> 25:15.440
You want a s'more?

25:16.400 --> 25:19.700
Okay,are you madjust 'cause you're here?

25:19.700 --> 25:21.610
Or are you still mad becauseI walked in on you and jill--  

25:21.610 --> 25:27.150
she offered me a job.In her E.R.

25:27.480 --> 25:32.310
As in,like,a bail-on-hankmed- and-leave-your-cfo-high-and-drykind of job?

25:32.310 --> 25:35.970
Well,that'snot how she put it,but,yeah,it could have that effect.

25:35.970 --> 25:37.100
And what did you say?

25:37.100 --> 25:39.640
That I'm gonna thinkabout it.

25:41.500 --> 25:42.450
What's to think about?

25:42.450 --> 25:44.410
Look what we've doneso far.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.900
Look at the grants.

25:45.900 --> 25:47.370
They're like the von trappsout there.

25:47.370 --> 25:51.930
It's like the ultimate proofthat there's nothing like a family business.

25:51.930 --> 25:55.720
The closer we stayto each other,the better.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.960
You said that after dad left.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.640
A long time ago.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.590
You ever wishyou could call him?

26:11.590 --> 26:13.700
Just say hi?

26:13.700 --> 26:18.740
Sometimes I wishI had a father I wanted to call.

26:21.670 --> 26:23.070
Is claire out at the campfire?

26:23.070 --> 26:24.730
- Uh,no.
- Keep an eye on will.

26:24.730 --> 26:26.730
Any change,let me know.

26:26.730 --> 26:28.210
Claire?

26:28.210 --> 26:32.000
Relax.Breathe.I'm here.

26:32.770 --> 26:34.340
So am I,man.

26:34.340 --> 26:35.830
What the hell?

26:35.830 --> 26:38.590
You're not--so sorry.

26:38.590 --> 26:41.770
I thought you were...in...labor.

26:41.770 --> 26:44.900
No,um... hank.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.610
So will needs your hel...  

26:47.820 --> 26:50.160
get out.

26:50.630 --> 26:52.380
He was on the floorwhen I found him.

26:52.380 --> 26:54.050
- What happened?
- Oh,is the baby coming?

26:54.050 --> 26:55.230
Oh,I tried to get up.

26:55.230 --> 26:59.690
No,no,we don't wantto refracture his leg.Get some help.A lot of help.

26:59.690 --> 27:00.970
Okay.Oh,I'm sorry.I'm so sorry.

27:00.970 --> 27:05.420
- Oh,it hurts.
- It's okay.Just stay right here.Don't move.

27:09.930 --> 27:10.930
Thank god will's okay.

27:10.930 --> 27:16.200
He is for now,but a compound fracture can be very dangerous,especially all the way out here.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.990
And so canan italian induction.

27:18.990 --> 27:21.070
Oh,is thatwhat they call that?

27:21.070 --> 27:23.740
I'm sorry.He was havinga blackberry withdrawal.

27:23.740 --> 27:27.630
Yeah,I had no idea that sexcauses childbirth.

27:27.630 --> 27:29.230
That kind of came out wrong.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.000
No,I had no idea that it induces laboreither.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.120
Uh,spicy foodscan also cause contractions and add nausea,

27:36.120 --> 27:39.820
vomiting,and dehydration to the miracleof childbirth.

27:39.820 --> 27:42.190
Honey,listen to the doctor.

27:42.190 --> 27:43.390
Thank you.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.300
That sucks!

27:45.300 --> 27:47.060
It's the only thing thatI actually wanted to do here.

27:47.060 --> 27:48.880
Okay,well,don't blame me.I'm just the manny.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.690
Yeah,we covered that.

27:50.690 --> 27:52.580
- You suck too.
- I'm--oh.

27:52.580 --> 27:55.490
Arlo!

27:55.790 --> 27:56.810
What happened?

27:56.810 --> 28:01.540
He just--he heard thatpaintball was cancelled,and he found the news,uh,unsettling.

28:01.540 --> 28:05.830
So maybe you could liftthe ban on video games?

28:05.830 --> 28:12.240
'Cause it would reallycheer him up,and,you know,it would make my jobso much easier.

28:13.110 --> 28:16.570
I'm gonna add a "please"in there.

28:16.570 --> 28:19.880
Could you pleasejust give me the ds?

28:21.700 --> 28:27.830
About last night,I get defensivewhen I fear someone's interferingwith my career goals.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.560
But that's no excuse.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.680
And I apologize.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.470
So do I.

28:35.470 --> 28:39.070
I should have made it clear,I don't want to derail hankmed.

28:39.070 --> 28:42.160
I'm sure it's tough enough startinga successful concierge practice.

28:42.160 --> 28:45.870
Well,almost as toughas starting an unsuccessful one.

28:45.870 --> 28:48.230
Twice.

28:48.410 --> 28:52.240
I have to make it workthis time.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.870
Even if hank takesthis job,he can run hankmedon the side.

28:55.870 --> 28:57.470
And both jobs would suffer.

28:57.470 --> 28:59.270
It would be a mistake.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.340
But one hankcould very well make.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.650
Seems like you and hankare similar that way.

29:04.650 --> 29:05.890
Trying to have it all.

29:05.890 --> 29:08.130
Mixing your patientswith his.

29:08.130 --> 29:11.120
Mixing your professional liveswith your personal lives.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.950
Maybe it iswishful thinking.

29:12.950 --> 29:17.370
Not thatmy hyper-compartmentalized lifestyle is the answer.

29:17.370 --> 29:19.950
I mean,my parentshave no idea what I do.

29:19.950 --> 29:21.220
How do you pull that off?

29:21.220 --> 29:23.690
Carefully.

29:23.690 --> 29:30.130
And sometimes I thinkit would be less confusing if I could just let everythingget all mixed up.

29:30.130 --> 29:33.650
No,mixing reallyhasn't worked for me.

29:33.650 --> 29:36.570
My ex is a doctor,an E.R.Doctor,

29:36.570 --> 29:40.990
and that didn't turn outto be such a great call.

29:40.990 --> 29:46.000
Well,speaking of calls,evan screwed upthe forwarding of our phones.

29:46.000 --> 29:51.630
And because hank's cellmust be out of range,I'm gettingall of hank's messages.

29:51.630 --> 29:55.320
Uh,I'm sorry.All--all of them?

29:55.320 --> 29:58.000
I might have deleted onelast night.

29:58.000 --> 30:01.820
By mistake.Of course.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.760
Good strong pulse.

30:08.520 --> 30:12.000
Good capillary refill.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.710
Huh,your temperature'sa bit elevated.

30:14.710 --> 30:16.680
May I have some water?

30:18.850 --> 30:19.940
Coumadin.

30:19.940 --> 30:21.450
This wasn'ton your list of meds.

30:21.450 --> 30:23.110
Oh,yeah,it's a new one.

30:23.110 --> 30:24.530
I keep forgettingto take it.

30:24.530 --> 30:28.390
This is a blood thinner.Don't tell me you took one.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.420
Oh,I took two.

30:30.420 --> 30:32.540
I thought it may helpmy headache.

30:32.540 --> 30:35.040
When did your headstart hurting?

30:35.040 --> 30:36.740
Uh,this morningor last night.

30:36.740 --> 30:39.710
- You were supposed to tell meif anything--  
- well,it's not that bad.

30:39.710 --> 30:43.270
It's just,you know,a little sore.

30:43.270 --> 30:45.870
There's a bump back here.Did this happen yesterday?

30:45.870 --> 30:49.800
I guess.Oh,I didn't notice.

30:52.890 --> 30:54.780
What do you mean,I suck?

30:54.780 --> 30:57.740
I don't suck.Even if I did suck,you can't be telling me I suck.

30:57.740 --> 31:01.030
You're,like,12.

31:03.660 --> 31:05.410
What's wrong with you?

31:05.410 --> 31:08.720
The truck accidentwas your fault.

31:08.720 --> 31:13.810
Well,if it's any consolation,my brother agrees with youon that.

31:13.810 --> 31:15.320
I hate this place.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.480
I always screw something up.

31:17.480 --> 31:20.150
When I was eight,I forgot to tie off the rowboat.

31:20.150 --> 31:23.260
The next year,I burnt down the tree house.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.970
And now this.

31:24.970 --> 31:29.570
If you'd have just let mekeep my nintendo,none of thiswould have happened.

31:31.380 --> 31:33.540
I got this reinstated.

31:33.540 --> 31:36.940
That's what I came down hereto tell you.

31:44.570 --> 31:47.150
But he's--he's bleedingin his brain?

31:47.150 --> 31:52.270
It may be a slow bleed,but he took a blood thinner,which increases the riskof a complication.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.960
And if there is a complicationbefore the chopper get back?

31:54.960 --> 32:00.790
Well,patients are alwaysbetter off in a hospital than the middle of the ocean because you never know.

32:00.790 --> 32:02.820
No,no,no,will isyour only concern right now.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.120
My legs are crosseduntil he is okay.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.040
What can I do to help?

32:07.040 --> 32:09.920
Uh,stay with him.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.630
Uh,monitor his mental status.

32:11.630 --> 32:15.640
If he starts to fadeor repeat himself,get me right away.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.120
What can I do?

32:17.120 --> 32:20.180
Okay,I need a drill.And all the bits.

32:20.180 --> 32:23.280
I need lois on hand,and I really needthat sat phone working.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.510
All right.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.490
What level are you on?

32:29.490 --> 32:34.560
Stage.Final.Third time through.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.720
Whoa,nice.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.580
Nice plasma burst,iron man.

32:39.580 --> 32:43.730
Thanks...kevin.

32:44.940 --> 32:48.660
It's cool being a hero,huh?

32:48.660 --> 32:51.080
You know that can happenin real life too.

32:51.080 --> 32:54.160
This may be really hardfor you to believe,like,I know it's crazy,

32:54.160 --> 32:58.370
but I used to screw up,like,all the time.

32:58.370 --> 33:01.300
Seems like everything I did,my brother would come along and just do it better.

33:01.300 --> 33:03.800
- Shocker.
- He was the hero.Always.

33:03.800 --> 33:05.790
He got allof our parents' attention.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.860
Well,I'm sure you get that,having two adorabletwin sisters.

33:08.860 --> 33:11.040
I always needed hank's help.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.570
Especially after our dadbailed on us.You know.

33:14.570 --> 33:18.280
Here's the funny thingabout life,though.

33:18.280 --> 33:21.240
It's actually a lotlike that game you're playing.

33:21.240 --> 33:25.250
It's all about justputting in the time and finding your strengths.

33:25.250 --> 33:26.610
And if youscrew up,you start over.

33:26.610 --> 33:28.570
If you screw up,you start over.

33:28.570 --> 33:31.980
And,eventually,one dayyour moment comes.

33:31.980 --> 33:34.480
Did your moment come?

33:34.480 --> 33:37.240
Very recently,actually.

33:37.240 --> 33:39.660
My brother needed mefor once.

33:39.660 --> 33:45.090
And,needless to say,I came through--like superman.

33:45.090 --> 33:47.010
Not like superman.He's too much of a boy scout.

33:47.010 --> 33:51.840
More like batman 'causehe's dark and mysterious and good with the ladies.

33:51.840 --> 33:56.150
But just hang in there.Your moment'll come.I promise.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.870
You just died.

33:59.870 --> 34:02.190
Sorry.

34:03.350 --> 34:04.890
What are you doingwith the blood?

34:04.890 --> 34:07.720
Trying to finda clotting factor for you.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.040
You know,just in case.

34:09.040 --> 34:11.159
Claire,could you come herefor a sec?

34:11.159 --> 34:14.770
All right.Put steady pressure on this.It'll bleed longerthan you think.

34:14.770 --> 34:17.940
What are you doingwith the blood?

34:22.040 --> 34:22.620
Thank you.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.219
Will doesn't knowhis blood type?

34:24.219 --> 34:25.429
Oh,I'm o positive.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.389
I'm type a,but I haveiron deficiency anemia.

34:28.389 --> 34:29.880
Ugh,then you reallyshouldn't donate.

34:29.880 --> 34:31.380
So you can do all thiswith a tray?

34:31.380 --> 34:34.710
Yeah,the mirror bouncesthe light,so I can seehow the bloods mix.

34:34.710 --> 34:37.090
If they're incompatible,they clump.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.469
Ah,just in time.I need your finger.

34:39.469 --> 34:41.690
Okay,I need to knowwhere you intend to put it.

34:41.690 --> 34:42.699
What the hell?

34:42.699 --> 34:47.650
Look,will may needa transfusion.I'm lookingfor a compatibility,and the grants haveatypical antigens,

34:47.650 --> 34:49.440
so I don't expectany matches there.

34:49.440 --> 34:50.330
Mm,of course.

34:50.330 --> 34:52.030
Can you really tellthat way?

34:52.030 --> 34:55.739
It's primitive,but you see how this one's agglutinating,or clumping up?

34:55.739 --> 34:57.400
That's mine.It's no good.

34:57.400 --> 35:01.890
In fact,damn. Damn. Damn.

35:01.890 --> 35:03.880
I'm taking that's bad,medically.

35:03.880 --> 35:06.080
No one's compatibleexcept lois.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.190
Well,I'll do it.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.890
No,I can't riskadding another patient to our roster out here.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.430
Will's stopped talking.

35:11.430 --> 35:13.800
He's stopped talking.

35:14.500 --> 35:16.690
Will?

35:16.690 --> 35:18.830
Open your eyes.

35:18.830 --> 35:21.160
Stay with me,will.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.640
Will.Will.

35:32.660 --> 35:33.240
What's happening?

35:33.240 --> 35:35.320
The herniation's puttingpressure on his brain.

35:35.320 --> 35:36.710
Let's tilt his head,okay?

35:36.710 --> 35:37.710
Can't you relievethe pressure?

35:37.710 --> 35:39.950
Without a clotting factor,he'll bleed out.We don't have a match.

35:39.950 --> 35:41.330
Well,what about me?Are you sure I can't do this?

35:41.330 --> 35:43.330
No way.You're pregnant.Remember?

35:43.330 --> 35:45.940
Use me.I'm a match.See.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.570
What?Dude,what did you do?

35:47.570 --> 35:49.510
I did it just how he did it.

35:49.510 --> 35:51.130
No agglutination,right?

35:51.130 --> 35:52.480
Right.

35:52.480 --> 35:56.190
It'sa very selfless offer,arlo,but I can't use youfor the transfusion.

35:56.190 --> 35:57.220
Why not?

35:57.220 --> 35:59.770
Look,you're too young to provide consent.

35:59.770 --> 36:01.990
Yeah,it's very thoughtful.

36:01.990 --> 36:02.840
What does that mean?

36:02.840 --> 36:03.870
His blood pressure's rising.

36:03.870 --> 36:06.800
I'm not stupid.I know what consent is.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.970
Tell the doctorit's okay.

36:07.970 --> 36:09.490
Okay,dude,you don't have to do this.

36:09.490 --> 36:10.630
I want to do this.

36:10.630 --> 36:11.810
Where is this coming from,arlo?

36:11.810 --> 36:13.390
This is notwhat I meant before,okay?

36:13.390 --> 36:16.340
Look,I don't knowwhat's gotten into him,but I want to embrace it.

36:16.340 --> 36:20.030
If it'll save will,you have my consent.

36:21.340 --> 36:23.860
Let's transfuse.

36:24.330 --> 36:25.730
You're doing great,arlo.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.040
Is it working?

36:27.040 --> 36:27.830
I want to see.

36:27.830 --> 36:30.140
Dude,just lay still.That's your only job,and it's an important one.

36:30.140 --> 36:31.660
We don't want you fainting.

36:31.660 --> 36:32.650
That's my job.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.470
Well,speaking of your job,where are the twins?

36:34.470 --> 36:38.170
Uh,I'll go checkon them.With pleasure.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.650
Oh,will's bloodis starting to clot.

36:41.650 --> 36:42.660
You did it,arlo.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.180
His heart rate is falling.

36:44.180 --> 36:46.530
Not for long.

36:49.330 --> 36:50.700
Rob,we're ready.

36:50.700 --> 36:53.120
The head bleeds a lot.Soak it up as fast as you can.

36:53.120 --> 36:55.020
Here we go.

36:55.020 --> 36:56.320
Hot stuff coming through.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.600
You got it?

36:57.600 --> 36:58.770
This one,right?

36:58.770 --> 37:01.090
Half-inch?

37:05.840 --> 37:07.080
Here we go.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.320
Hold steady.

37:24.530 --> 37:26.050
Wait,wait,he's bleedingmore,he's bleeding more.

37:26.050 --> 37:28.980
No.The hematoma's draining,which meansthat any second now...  

37:28.980 --> 37:32.580
his blood pressure'scoming down.

37:34.160 --> 37:36.160
Oh,claire.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.990
Oh,will,we're all here.

37:39.990 --> 37:42.240
How you feeling,arlo?

37:42.630 --> 37:44.760
So the twins are reading,and they're still twins,

37:44.760 --> 37:48.550
and the medevac chopperis about ten minutes away with the second one rightbehind it for the rest of us.

37:48.550 --> 37:49.920
How'd you callfor a chopper?

37:49.920 --> 37:52.250
He resuscitatedthe sat phone.

37:52.250 --> 37:55.330
Call me supermanny.

37:56.050 --> 37:59.690
Oh,I seeyou used the drill and...

38:01.370 --> 38:04.370
Okay,okay,easy.

38:04.370 --> 38:07.580
Easy with the leg.Turn him to the left.All right,will.Good.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.660
You're clear!

38:23.460 --> 38:25.060
Hey,did you call 911?

38:25.060 --> 38:29.500
Yeah,the ambulanceis waiting at the helipad,and our chopper's,like,five minutes away.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.730
Drink your juice,dude.

38:30.730 --> 38:32.610
It'll put hairon your chest.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.580
You need some too.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.780
No,you didn'T.

38:36.780 --> 38:38.650
You're a smart little hobbit,aren't you?

38:38.650 --> 38:39.400
Nice one.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.600
Arlo really stepped up today.

38:41.600 --> 38:43.450
Like a real grant.

38:43.450 --> 38:44.710
You're right.

38:44.710 --> 38:47.550
I'm so proud of him.

38:48.880 --> 38:52.180
You know,maybe you're rightabout this place.

38:52.180 --> 38:55.130
There is something specialabout it.

38:55.130 --> 38:57.220
See?

39:08.700 --> 39:11.520
Hey,I hopeyou got my message.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.350
Yes,and the ravesfrom my neurosurgeon.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.270
Guess you hada busy weekend.

39:17.270 --> 39:20.740
Yeah,you know,I really was stranded without cell service.

39:20.740 --> 39:23.080
Can you hear me now?

39:23.080 --> 39:25.990
Because I need an answeron the E.R. Job.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.250
Did you think about it?

39:28.250 --> 39:31.260
Actually,I kind of forgotto think about it.

39:31.260 --> 39:33.480
And I thinkthat says something.

39:33.880 --> 39:35.960
Can we,um... yeah.

39:35.960 --> 39:40.840
Look,I loved the E.R.,But the weekend made me realize how much I'm enjoying this.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.250
And not just the independence.

39:42.250 --> 39:45.670
I'm getting to knowmy patients as people.

39:45.670 --> 39:50.780
So I'm not saying never,but for now I'm gonna seewhere this takes me.

39:50.780 --> 39:53.520
I hopeI'm not letting you down.

39:54.180 --> 39:56.150
Maybe just a part of me.

39:56.150 --> 39:58.580
Which part?

39:58.900 --> 40:00.800
I realized something elsethis weekend.

40:00.800 --> 40:02.980
What's that?

40:03.470 --> 40:05.610
I missed you.

40:05.610 --> 40:08.580
You don't knowwhat you missed.

40:10.070 --> 40:11.920
I got to deal with this.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.570
Oh,can I call you later?

40:13.570 --> 40:17.660
I don't know.Can you?

40:19.560 --> 40:21.010
What?

40:21.010 --> 40:22.350
That makes no sense.

40:22.350 --> 40:23.600
No,just trust me.

40:23.600 --> 40:27.740
Look,we can watch thisand dvr that all at the same time.

40:27.740 --> 40:29.700
Why would I watcha tv show set in a hospital?

40:29.700 --> 40:30.960
I'm in a hospital.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.170
Because the peoplein this hospital aren't all really charismatic supermodels.

40:34.170 --> 40:35.290
Are these guys bothering you?

40:35.290 --> 40:36.470
You got to get meout of here,doc.

40:36.470 --> 40:37.400
I'm working on that.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.350
Doesn't he look great?

40:38.350 --> 40:40.330
Thanks to him.And especially to him.

40:40.330 --> 40:45.230
And thanks to youfor giving me my first lessonin motherhood: I am in control of nothing.

40:45.230 --> 40:47.670
You are gonna bea great mom.

40:47.670 --> 40:49.000
Eventually.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.010
Mm,and I would liketo invite you to the island again next yearas my guest.

40:52.010 --> 40:54.550
I'm in.You want to book the manny too?

40:54.550 --> 40:55.790
How are you with infants?

40:55.790 --> 40:58.400
- I'm honestly--I'm-- 
- you can come.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.850
I have a soft spotfor siblings.

40:59.850 --> 41:02.100
Awesome.Thank you very much.

41:02.100 --> 41:04.600
Hey,short round,you want to get some ice cream?I'm buying.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.350
Isn't there free ice creamin this hospital?

41:06.350 --> 41:09.260
Oh,yeah,that's the point.

41:09.260 --> 41:11.540
Enjoy.

41:14.020 --> 41:17.100
So the grants are partof a rare blood group.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.010
Your blood matchedlois and arlo.

41:20.010 --> 41:24.090
In fact your only matches were grants.

41:24.090 --> 41:28.990
Tell me,will,what are the odds of that?

41:28.990 --> 41:31.970
Well,you have to askmy grandmother and claire's great-uncle.

41:31.970 --> 41:35.920
Please don't say anything.This generation of grantsdoesn't know.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.920
Why wouldn't you wantto share a secret like that?

41:37.920 --> 41:40.580
Oh,wear a suitat corporate headquarters?

41:40.580 --> 41:42.520
No,I like my independence.

41:42.520 --> 41:44.410
And I belongon that island.

41:44.410 --> 41:46.290
It's where I feel connected.

41:46.290 --> 41:49.600
Well,sounds like at leastone grant feels the same way.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.810
Maybe you should facebook her.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.820
- Which book?

41:55.820 --> 41:58.590
God,I'm tired.Being rainmaker's exhausting.

41:58.590 --> 41:59.950
And rewarding.

41:59.950 --> 42:03.980
Just one more reason I'd neverleave my cfo high and dry.

42:03.980 --> 42:04.730
Good.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.550
You did a good jobwith arlo.

42:06.550 --> 42:09.070
It is easierbeing big brother,I find.

42:09.070 --> 42:10.940
Let's agreeto disagree on that.

42:10.940 --> 42:14.680
But it is excitingto see you bring a whole new skill setto our little family business.

42:14.680 --> 42:15.780
Does that meanI get a raise?

42:15.780 --> 42:18.000
Depends.Can you make yourselfscarce tonight?

42:18.000 --> 42:21.310
For a price,dr.Lawson,anything is possible.
