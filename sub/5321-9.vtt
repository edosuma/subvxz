actually seeing UFOs and this...

14:15.040 --> 14:18.328

has been talking to them.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.808

14:22.000 --> 14:24.367
than to believe
that UFOs are coming to save us.

14:24.520 --> 14:27.603
(LAUGHS) Right.

14:30.280 --> 14:32.647

what's really going on?

14:34.000 --> 14:37.766
- Not really.
- Don't listen to him.

14:37.920 --> 14:42.130
Of course we want to know
what's really going on.

14:45.800 --> 14:49.247
The aliens are not coming
to save us.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.042
Because they're already here.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.322
I told you we didn't
want to know what's going on.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.925
They've been here
for thousands of years.

who caused the zombie virus.

this is all very informative.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.482

on planet earth, so...

15:08.640 --> 15:11.610
Oh, I know.
You think I'm crazy.

15:11.800 --> 15:15.282

15:16.800 --> 15:18.370

15:19.720 --> 15:21.563

15:21.720 --> 15:24.451

come back and infect us all.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.921
Do it now before it's too late.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.367

15:30.520 --> 15:31.965
And whatever you do...

15:33.200 --> 15:35.771
...do not listen
to that Bernadette chick.

15:35.920 --> 15:38.526
She will get you all killed.

over the asylum. Time to go.

we saw?

15:51.640 --> 15:53.483
That could fly us out of here.

15:53.680 --> 15:55.489
There's an air force base here,
actually.

15:55.680 --> 15:58.684
They abandoned it in the '60s,
but that's just a cover story.

16:00.280 --> 16:03.170
Well, I want to believe in UFOs.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.163

to fly my ass off

I'm cool with it.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.962

16:10.960 --> 16:12.803
Are we actually talking about

16:12.960 --> 16:16.521
going to an abandoned
air force base in Roswell

16:16.680 --> 16:21.322
to see if we can find a UFO
to fly us to California?

16:21.480 --> 16:23.323

like that...

16:23.480 --> 16:26.165

16:26.320 --> 16:27.845

28:34.520 --> 28:36.329
That's how they knew
we were coming.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.481
VASQUEZ: Something sure wanted
out of here.

28:52.920 --> 28:55.048
Seems empty now.

28:57.200 --> 28:59.089
Wait. Where's Bernadette?

28:59.240 --> 29:01.208
BERNADETTE: I'm here.

29:15.800 --> 29:19.122
This is what happens
when we don't trust them.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.689
WARREN: Aliens did this?

29:22.840 --> 29:24.888
We left them no choice.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.524
That work?

29:35.680 --> 29:37.967
(RAPID CLICKING)

29:38.120 --> 29:41.681
Can't tell if it's out of...
ammo or batteries.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.127
What do you think was in there?
That thing we killed?

29:59.960 --> 30:03.885
I hope so, 'cause if it's
something worse than that,

30:04.040 --> 30:06.088
I don't wanna find out.

30:14.720 --> 30:16.245
ADDY: What?

30:19.640 --> 30:21.324
OK.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.485
Ooh.

30:32.480 --> 30:34.448
Something for you
to look forward to.

30:35.760 --> 30:38.047
Look, yeah, I can't tell
what's real and what isn't.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.089
Don't you think it's unusual

30:40.240 --> 30:42.561
that these aliens
mostly communicate in English?

30:42.720 --> 30:44.370
Mostly.

30:44.520 --> 30:47.171
I dunno. Maybe this is their tap
into our old internet.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.408
They've got global files here.

30:53.320 --> 30:54.845
Oh.

30:55.880 --> 31:00.488
OK. So these aliens
are stalkers from space.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.608
Is that...

31:04.960 --> 31:07.281
Wow. I look like hell.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.922
Well, look what the cat
dragged in.

31:21.360 --> 31:23.647
What is all this?

31:24.760 --> 31:27.923
(CHUCKLES)
You are one popular dude.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.930
And what's this?

31:32.080 --> 31:34.606
"Zona"? What's Zona?

31:34.760 --> 31:37.809
(GASPS) Maybe
it's their home planet.

31:37.960 --> 31:41.681
Or what they call the pie
they're gonna bake us into.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.044
WARREN: This way.

32:02.080 --> 32:03.525
-(SNARLING)
- WARREN: There it is.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.284
Be ready for anything.

32:05.480 --> 32:09.963
No, don't worry. They won't hurt us.
They come in peace. See?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.929
(STRANGE CLICKING)

32:12.080 --> 32:13.764
VASQUEZ:
What do you think it wants?

32:13.920 --> 32:15.570
10K: If it's a zombie,
it wants brains.

32:15.720 --> 32:17.404
If it's an alien,
it wants to probe us.

32:17.560 --> 32:19.801
- Either way, I'm killing it.
- No! Don't kill it.

32:19.960 --> 32:22.361
Can't you see
it doesn't want to hurt us?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.249
-(SOFT GROWLING)
- Bernadette, no!

32:25.400 --> 32:27.448
It's alright.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.725
BERNADETTE: It's OK.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.963
(GROWLS)

32:42.200 --> 32:43.725
(CREATURE GROWLS)

32:51.120 --> 32:53.805
BERNADETTE:
Please stop shooting him!

33:24.400 --> 33:26.323
(BEEPING)

33:26.520 --> 33:28.602
- Bernadette!
- Get down!

33:35.920 --> 33:38.764
- Bernadette!
- VASQUEZ: After 'em.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.329
WARREN: Bernadette!

33:46.720 --> 33:48.529
Oh, sweet!

33:51.040 --> 33:52.883
- Does it work?
- I don't know.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.361
(WEAPON BUZZES)

33:58.680 --> 34:00.682
Guess that'd be a yes.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.444
4,243.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.449
(WOMAN SCREAMS)

34:04.640 --> 34:07.211
- WOMAN: No. No! No!
- Bernadette?

34:07.360 --> 34:09.567
Come on. Bring that thing.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.083
Ready?

34:36.679 --> 34:38.648
VASQUEZ: We're right back
where we started.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.969
What was
Mr Toad's Wild Ride for?

34:42.120 --> 34:43.929
10K: Visitors entrance.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.889
Anybody got eyes
on Bernadette or the alien?

34:48.400 --> 34:49.481
10K: There.

34:51.719 --> 34:53.848
WARREN: Well, I'll be damned.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.329
Careful, gentlemen.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.129
Don't get sucked up.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.487
VASQUEZ: Looks like
the entire base is alive.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.484
WARREN: Not just the base.
The whole city.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.290
(RUNNING FOOTSTEPS)

35:12.440 --> 35:15.205
ADDY: You guys will not believe
what we found out on that...

35:15.360 --> 35:17.681
What is that?

35:24.760 --> 35:26.569
MURPHY: I don't believe it.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.450
WARREN: Murphy, you alright?

35:33.720 --> 35:35.961
Murphy?

35:36.120 --> 35:38.327
Murphy, don't!

35:45.560 --> 35:47.528
10K, don't let 'em get him!

35:48.560 --> 35:50.608
(WEAPON BUZZES)

35:59.000 --> 36:01.002
Murphy, don't do it! Don't go!

36:01.160 --> 36:05.484
They're gonna probe you for sure!
And not in a good way!

36:26.680 --> 36:30.082
- Let's go. This way. This way.
- Come on.

36:57.400 --> 36:59.209
VASQUEZ: Oh, careful that thing
doesn't blow.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.687
- Is it alive?
- I can't tell.

37:01.840 --> 37:06.801
Help him. Please help him.
Oh! Oh, God.

37:12.680 --> 37:15.047
What if it can't
breathe our air?

37:15.200 --> 37:17.885
Uh, then I guess he came
to the wrong planet.

37:30.600 --> 37:34.082
- Dan Scully?
- That nutjob from Pluto?

37:34.240 --> 37:36.527
BERNADETTE:
I don't understand, Mr Scully.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.445
Why are you acting like
one of the aliens?

37:39.600 --> 37:43.207
I'm sorry, Bernadette.
There are no aliens.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.927
It...it was always just me.

37:48.960 --> 37:51.486
I'm sorry I lied to you. (PANTS)

37:51.640 --> 37:55.326
I was gonna tell you the truth
once you got on board.

37:55.480 --> 37:57.960
You mean there are no aliens?

37:58.120 --> 38:00.043
Only you?

38:00.200 --> 38:02.362
Just me.

38:03.800 --> 38:08.727
The rest were just test pilot zombies
from year one.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.484
(COUGHS)

38:10.680 --> 38:12.091
Why are you still alive?

38:12.240 --> 38:14.447
I've only been here
a few months.

38:16.080 --> 38:19.926
Everyone was dead or turned
when I got here.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.083
My job was to salvage

38:24.280 --> 38:25.964
any technology
they were testing here.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.930
I was supposed to fly...

38:30.240 --> 38:32.049
...this craft back to Zona.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.242
(PANTS)

38:34.400 --> 38:37.688
- I wanted to take you with me.
- Where's Zona?

38:37.840 --> 38:40.081
You wanted to take me?

38:40.240 --> 38:43.084
It's beautiful there.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.889
How did they know about me?

38:48.040 --> 38:51.806
Oh. Face recognition software.

38:51.960 --> 38:55.646
A drone picked you up
in Colorado.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.530
A drone in Colorado?

38:58.680 --> 39:01.206
This is alien technology,
isn't it?

39:01.400 --> 39:05.200
Oh, who knows?
That's all above my pay grade.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.209
Oh, wow.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.687
I'm not gonna make it, am I?

39:09.840 --> 39:12.684
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- Because...

39:12.840 --> 39:15.491
'Cause...l was...

39:15.640 --> 39:19.645
...l was afraid you wouldn't go
without the others.

- MURPHY: Told ya so.
-10K: This proves nothing.

40:35.080 --> 40:37.367
You know, I'm sorry
it didn't work out.

40:38.600 --> 40:42.446
I would've liked to have gone
with the aliens.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.251
Anything to get out of
this damn apocalypse.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.724
You gonna be OK?

40:48.920 --> 40:50.570
It's not me I'm worried about.

40:50.720 --> 40:53.007
It's all the others
back at Roswell

40:53.160 --> 40:56.642
who have all their hopes
tied up in this, in me.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.404
What are you gonna do?

40:59.440 --> 41:00.930
I don't know.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.927
WARREN: I believe in you.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.244
She's here! She's OK!

41:35.480 --> 41:38.245
We saw the lights and the explosion.
We were worried sick.

41:39.400 --> 41:42.370
Did you see the visitors?
What did they say?

41:48.560 --> 41:51.006
They said
we need to wait longer.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.048
The human race isn't ready yet.
