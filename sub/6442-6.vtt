00:04.900 --> 00:06.697
Louise McCallum...

00:06.869 --> 00:08.860
...no one ever really
said much about her.

00:09.038 --> 00:11.734
Just that I had a
great-aunt who died young.

00:11.907 --> 00:15.343
I'm guessing they never
mentioned she had a husband.

00:15.511 --> 00:19.470
No, but I don't think
you can blame them.

00:19.648 --> 00:23.175
-You were convicted of her murder.
-Yeah.

00:23.452 --> 00:26.580
If you were so anxious to see me,
why'd you wait all these years to write?

00:26.756 --> 00:29.782
Your Aunt Nell, she asked me not to.

00:31.660 --> 00:35.289
I don't mean to be rude,
Mr. McCallum...

00:35.464 --> 00:40.060
...but even if I did believe your story,
I don't know what you want me to do.

00:40.236 --> 00:46.334
I just need somebody in Louise's
family to know I truly loved my wife...

00:46.509 --> 00:48.704
...and I'm not the man who killed her.

00:55.284 --> 00:56.649
Louise!

01:00.489 --> 01:01.956
Louise!

01:03.392 --> 01:09.228
It was 42 years ago,
and I can still hear those shots.

01:13.569 --> 01:14.729
Louise.

01:16.205 --> 01:18.901
Louise! No!

01:22.077 --> 01:23.908
Sheriff Tate arrived...

01:24.079 --> 01:26.707
Dex, Louise, you out here?

01:26.882 --> 01:30.318
...and found me with the gun
and Louise dead in my arms.

01:30.486 --> 01:32.044
Dex.

01:34.190 --> 01:35.885
What have you done?

01:37.993 --> 01:42.327
I swear to you
that's what happened that night.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.360
And when I saw
your picture in the paper...

01:47.236 --> 01:50.637
...I couldn't get over how
much you looked like Louise.

01:50.806 --> 01:54.333
I thought, if you are anything like her...

01:54.510 --> 01:57.377
...you'd be the one person
who could understand.

02:00.216 --> 02:04.653
If you're saying that you didn't
kill her, then who did?

02:05.120 --> 02:08.487
The man I saw leaving the barn.

02:08.657 --> 02:09.817
A drifter.

02:09.991 --> 02:12.552
He killed my Louise.

02:14.000 --> 02:20.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:14.156 --> 03:17.421
What happened to this guy?
This drifter?

03:17.593 --> 03:20.391
They never caught him.
Dexter said that people assumed...

03:20.563 --> 03:22.827
...that he made the story up
to cover his tracks.

03:22.998 --> 03:25.990
-But you believe him.
-Well, why would he lie to me?

03:26.168 --> 03:29.331
It's not like he's gonna get
the last 40 years of his life back.

03:29.505 --> 03:34.442
Convicted murderers spend half their day
trying to convince people they're innocent.

03:34.843 --> 03:37.710
Clark, that drawing
looks exactly like you.

03:38.781 --> 03:42.740
So unless Dexter could've
predicted the future...

03:42.918 --> 03:46.012
...there's a pretty good chance
that drifter was real.

03:48.023 --> 03:50.389
It could've been your grandfather.

03:50.993 --> 03:54.121
-Even your father.
-That's impossible.

03:55.030 --> 03:58.466
Why? You must've come
from somewhere.

03:58.634 --> 04:01.535
It's not like you just
fell out of the sky.

04:14.683 --> 04:16.742
I think Lana's right.
It is Jor-El.

04:16.918 --> 04:18.910
From 1 961?

04:19.088 --> 04:22.216
These cave walls said that people
from Krypton had been here before.

04:22.391 --> 04:24.655
-Why not my father?
-Clark.

04:24.827 --> 04:27.853
Don't you think you're trying too hard
to make a connection here?

04:28.030 --> 04:31.431
You saw the medallion he was wearing.
The symbol's Kryptonian.

04:32.001 --> 04:35.596
Okay, let's just say that it was Jor-El.

04:35.771 --> 04:39.730
From what I know, it's not a stretch
to believe he could kill somebody--

04:39.908 --> 04:42.706
That's the thing. We don't know
that much about him.

04:42.878 --> 04:45.779
All Jor-El has been to me
is some distant powerful threat.

04:45.948 --> 04:48.610
But if he was here,
walking the same streets as me...

04:48.784 --> 04:50.752
...maybe we're not so different.

04:50.919 --> 04:52.716
Maybe he's more human
than we thought.

04:52.888 --> 04:54.185
Clark....

04:56.025 --> 04:57.515
Clark.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.960
Isn't that what you're looking for?

05:08.103 --> 05:10.230
I knew I'd seen it down here.

05:30.926 --> 05:33.417
Clark. Clark!

05:39.902 --> 05:41.767
What is that?

05:49.445 --> 05:52.209
The images I saw
must've been from the past.

05:53.048 --> 05:56.245
Clark, you really need to lay off
the late-night television.

05:56.418 --> 05:57.680
I'm not kidding, Pete.

05:57.853 --> 06:02.256
I had all these flashes, but they went by
so fast, I couldn't make sense of them.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.076
-Give it over.
-Get away from me!

06:32.254 --> 06:34.222
Give me the money.
I know you've got it.

06:49.805 --> 06:51.238
My hero.

06:52.374 --> 06:56.003
You don't strike me as someone
who usually needs saving.

06:56.178 --> 06:57.770
Thank you.

07:05.154 --> 07:08.612
-Did you see that? He could've killed me!
-Tell it to the judge.

07:08.791 --> 07:10.725
Thanks.

07:11.927 --> 07:13.258
I'm Louise.

07:15.497 --> 07:17.089
You can call me Joe.

07:18.901 --> 07:20.926
Well, Joe...

07:21.103 --> 07:23.799
...you're the most excitement
we've had all year.

07:23.972 --> 07:25.701
Watch your head.

07:28.043 --> 07:30.603
Well, I guess we owe you our gratitude.

07:31.113 --> 07:35.140
Hi, I'm Sheriff Billy Tate.
Those are some reflexes you got there.

07:35.517 --> 07:37.314
They kind of surprised me too.

07:37.486 --> 07:39.784
I haven't seen you
around Smallville before.

07:41.557 --> 07:45.584
-I'm just passing through on my way home.
-Lucky you.

07:46.094 --> 07:48.585
Forgive Louise.
She's got stars in her eyes.

07:48.764 --> 07:50.254
Always has.

07:50.732 --> 07:52.563
There's nothing wrong with that.

08:01.276 --> 08:02.971
Louise?

08:03.812 --> 08:05.871
Everything all right?

08:07.149 --> 08:11.176
You go on home, Louise. I know how
Dex hates to miss his bridge game.

08:11.353 --> 08:13.321
I'll drive by and get your statement.

08:17.526 --> 08:19.153
See you around.

08:41.450 --> 08:42.883
I appreciate your help.

08:43.452 --> 08:45.477
Clark, what's going on?

08:45.654 --> 08:48.179
It's like I was back in the '50s.

08:48.357 --> 08:50.552
I was standing right here where Joe was.

08:51.326 --> 08:52.588
Joe?

08:53.328 --> 08:55.057
It's the name of the drifter.

08:56.798 --> 09:00.290
Pete, you remember when I was
in the cave and I got all those flashes?

09:00.802 --> 09:03.737
I think this medallion
downloaded me with all his memories.

09:04.172 --> 09:06.436
When I touch something of his,
it triggers one.

09:06.842 --> 09:08.332
Right.

09:09.645 --> 09:11.340
Louise was here too.

09:12.447 --> 09:13.846
The drifter, he saved her.

09:14.016 --> 09:15.984
Well, of course he did.

09:16.151 --> 09:21.111
Clark, back here in the 21 st century,
we call that a daydream.

09:22.324 --> 09:25.350
There's got to be a way to find out
if what I saw really happened.

09:30.599 --> 09:33.159
Since when can you take
police records out of city hall?

09:33.335 --> 09:37.829
Since I caught the clerk and his girlfriend
playing cops and robbers on the job.

09:38.006 --> 09:40.099
Well, the robbery
should be around June, 1 961.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.402
That's when the movie
was playing at the Talon.

09:42.577 --> 09:45.512
I don't mean to give you the third
degree, but how do you know--?

09:45.681 --> 09:48.343
I told you, it's just a hunch
that the drifter was there.

09:48.517 --> 09:52.920
I get that. It's the robbery outside the Talon
with the Natalie Wood movie playing...

09:53.088 --> 09:56.080
...that's a little more detailed
than your average hunch.

09:56.258 --> 09:59.785
Well, as curator of the Wall of Weird,
just go with me on this one.

10:00.162 --> 10:01.424
Okay.

10:01.596 --> 10:04.190
There's pages missing
from the day of Louise's murder.

10:04.366 --> 10:06.493
Well, someone gets a D in subtlety.

10:07.369 --> 10:10.702
-All right, here's the robbery.
-You see our heroic drifter anywhere?

10:10.872 --> 10:13.170
No, but look at the name of the robber.

10:13.408 --> 10:16.900
Lachlan Luthor.
That's Lex's grandpa.

10:17.145 --> 10:19.875
Oh, come on, I had
a three-megabyte file on Lex.

10:20.048 --> 10:21.481
I know his favorite cereal.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.442
Maybe he knows something.

10:23.618 --> 10:26.781
Well, you're gonna have to find out.
I gotta meet Lana.

10:26.955 --> 10:28.616
Nell found some of Louise's things.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.655
This is where I'm going to have to bail.

10:30.826 --> 10:33.317
Last time I researched
the Luthors, Lex almost got killed.

10:33.495 --> 10:36.953
Please, you're gonna have to
deal with him sooner or later.

10:45.874 --> 10:51.176
I always assumed my father's knack
for taking people's money was inherited...

10:51.346 --> 10:54.873
...but I hardly think petty crime
runs in the family.

10:55.050 --> 10:58.178
Well, Smallville isn't exactly
teeming with Lachlan Luthors.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.049
Your grandfather has to be
the one who was arrested.

11:02.257 --> 11:03.519
Chloe...

11:04.926 --> 11:07.053
...no one in my family
set foot in this town...

11:07.229 --> 11:09.561
...until my father bought
the creamed corn factory.

11:09.731 --> 11:12.700
Isn't an age-old robbery
a little off your usual teen beat?

11:12.868 --> 11:15.996
This one's pro bono. Lana's really
worried about her great-uncle.

11:17.472 --> 11:20.635
Something tells me you're not here
because of Lana.

11:21.443 --> 11:25.243
Anyway, we think Lachlan met
the drifter, and we were hoping--

11:25.414 --> 11:26.904
What?

11:27.082 --> 11:29.710
That my family
sat around at Thanksgiving...

11:29.885 --> 11:32.319
...sharing old crime stories?

11:33.522 --> 11:37.117
Your family isn't exactly
a Norman Rockwell painting.

11:39.061 --> 11:42.553
Look, Lex, we're just
trying to find what we can.

11:43.031 --> 11:45.431
I wish I could help you, Chloe...

11:45.600 --> 11:48.160
...but I'm afraid you've met a dead end.

12:02.651 --> 12:06.178
-Hey.
-Hi, Lana.

12:08.390 --> 12:11.621
Look, I'm really sorry about
being so defensive this morning.

12:11.793 --> 12:13.522
You don't have to apologize.

12:13.695 --> 12:16.220
I kind of dumped a lot on you all at once.

12:17.065 --> 12:20.626
I guess it's just when you're adopted,
you dream about where you came from...

12:20.802 --> 12:23.168
...and what your birth parents were like.

12:24.306 --> 12:27.104
The biggest nightmare
is that they were criminals.

12:27.275 --> 12:32.303
With all the strange surprises I've had
in my family, I know it's not easy.

12:36.952 --> 12:39.250
There are only
a few of Louise's things.

12:39.421 --> 12:42.515
But I think we'll be able
to find something.

12:57.572 --> 12:59.233
It's a love letter.

13:00.642 --> 13:02.439
Dexter must have written this.

13:05.147 --> 13:08.310
Wow. Who knew he could be so....

13:09.217 --> 13:10.514
Passionate?

13:14.890 --> 13:16.323
Only an initial?

13:30.505 --> 13:32.268
Could you?

13:56.364 --> 13:58.559
I couldn't stop
thinking about you all day.

14:12.147 --> 14:15.207
I've never felt this way about anyone.

14:16.718 --> 14:18.913
All I know is I want to be with you.

15:43.638 --> 15:45.003
Clark?

15:46.975 --> 15:49.944
Lana, I don't think that love letter
is from her husband.

15:51.646 --> 15:53.614
I think it's from the drifter.

15:55.183 --> 15:56.912
They were in love.

16:05.427 --> 16:08.260
Congratulations, Lex.
That was an excellent presentation.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.694
The board was impressed.

16:10.865 --> 16:14.733
It was smoke and mirrors,
but skillfully done.

16:14.903 --> 16:19.135
What can I say? I guess the
art of deception runs in the family.

16:20.241 --> 16:23.472
And the day was off
to such a sweet start.

16:26.514 --> 16:28.379
Deception, huh?

16:28.750 --> 16:31.241
You think I've been
deceiving you about something?

16:31.419 --> 16:32.818
You tell me.

16:32.987 --> 16:35.114
You've always described
grandfather Lachlan...

16:35.290 --> 16:37.850
...as a hardworking entrepreneur
from Scottish nobility.

16:38.026 --> 16:39.516
What are you driving at, son?

16:39.694 --> 16:41.855
Maybe you could explain
why a Lachlan Luthor...

16:42.030 --> 16:45.431
...was arrested in 1 961
for petty robbery in Smallville.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.731
Not all entrepreneurs can have the luxury
of being both successful and honest.

16:50.905 --> 16:54.170
Why would you go to such lengths
to hide our past?

16:55.777 --> 16:57.972
When I was young...

16:58.146 --> 17:03.641
...and trying hard to get a foothold
in the world of overachieving lvy Leaguers...

17:03.818 --> 17:07.253
...I quickly found that confessing
to the fact that I was born and bred...

17:07.422 --> 17:12.826
...in a place like Suicide Slum wasn't gonna
win anybody over at a cocktail party.

17:12.993 --> 17:15.359
So you took the liberty
of rewriting our history?

17:15.530 --> 17:19.125
That's right. Why should l
have to pay for the sins of my father?

17:19.300 --> 17:21.097
Sounds familiar.

17:21.770 --> 17:25.365
Is the memorial
in our family plot even real...

17:25.540 --> 17:28.509
...or do I have grandparents
wandering around Suicide Slum?

17:31.079 --> 17:32.637
No, no, they....

17:35.383 --> 17:36.873
They both died...

17:37.852 --> 17:40.116
...in a tenement fire.

17:45.794 --> 17:50.925
The only reason I'm alive
is I was moonlighting at the....

17:52.867 --> 17:56.234
At a print shop when it happened.

18:00.442 --> 18:05.607
Ever since then,
I've buried myself in work.

18:07.849 --> 18:09.783
Consciously.

18:18.126 --> 18:20.458
This is the barn
where Louise was shot.

18:25.967 --> 18:29.596
Clark, it's been over 40 years.
What do you expect to find here?

19:05.106 --> 19:07.404
I have to leave tonight.

19:08.610 --> 19:10.669
I'm leaving with you.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.841
I told you, that's not possible.

19:14.015 --> 19:17.951
I can't stay with Dex anymore.
I don't love him.

19:18.119 --> 19:21.384
You're the one I want to be with.

19:21.556 --> 19:23.114
We wouldn't be accepted.

19:23.291 --> 19:26.488
I don't care what people think.
I never have.

19:27.395 --> 19:29.420
Dex says that's my curse.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.127
No, Louise...

19:34.536 --> 19:35.935
...that's a gift.

19:37.639 --> 19:39.573
We're not that different, Joe.

19:39.741 --> 19:41.038
I'm willing to try.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.204
This wasn't supposed to happen.

19:48.650 --> 19:50.413
I have to return home alone.

19:50.585 --> 19:51.984
Why?

19:53.588 --> 19:55.818
Because it's my destiny,
and I can't change it.

20:00.862 --> 20:03.854
Louise, as much I want this,
I can't have it.

20:08.369 --> 20:12.135
My father told me
that someday I'd understand...

20:12.307 --> 20:14.571
...that my actions have consequences.

20:16.110 --> 20:18.044
I guess this is what he meant.

20:22.717 --> 20:24.014
It's not fair.

20:28.156 --> 20:30.283
We should be together.

20:38.366 --> 20:39.856
Louise.

21:00.054 --> 21:02.147
Joe....

21:05.293 --> 21:06.885
No.

21:07.395 --> 21:08.828
Louise?

21:13.067 --> 21:14.557
Don't leave me.

21:15.203 --> 21:16.966
I'll never leave.

21:19.907 --> 21:21.465
I love you.

21:27.315 --> 21:29.010
Louise.

21:29.183 --> 21:30.616
No.

21:31.085 --> 21:32.814
No, Louise.

21:36.190 --> 21:37.680
Louise.

21:44.298 --> 21:45.890
Clark.

21:48.336 --> 21:50.133
I know who killed her.

21:52.206 --> 21:55.039
The Edgecliff Condos.

21:55.977 --> 21:58.411
They're owned by LuthorCorp...

21:58.579 --> 22:01.173
...but I'm missing the connection
to my grandparents.

22:01.349 --> 22:03.681
Well, before the condos
and the coffeehouses...

22:03.851 --> 22:07.116
...this was the worst
part of Suicide Slums.

22:07.288 --> 22:08.983
That high-rise...

22:09.157 --> 22:12.285
...stands on the site of the tenement
your grandparents died in.

22:17.932 --> 22:20.332
So my father's story is true.

22:21.402 --> 22:23.768
They died in a fire.

22:24.439 --> 22:25.838
If you call an explosion...

22:26.007 --> 22:30.000
...that blows the windows
out of two city blocks a fire, yeah.

22:30.678 --> 22:35.206
-lt sounds like you have your doubts.
-I was a detective in that precinct.

22:35.383 --> 22:38.375
Back in those days when they told
you to drop a case, you did it.

22:38.553 --> 22:40.953
The slumlords controlled city hall.

22:41.122 --> 22:43.818
Well, I'm retired now.
It doesn't really matter.

22:45.059 --> 22:48.051
I think you'll find
my original report enlightening.

22:58.773 --> 23:00.536
I don't mean to rain on your parade...

23:00.708 --> 23:03.370
...but Lachlan was in the jail
at the time of the murder.

23:03.544 --> 23:04.943
-I know it was him.
-How?

23:05.113 --> 23:07.513
You can't expect us
to follow these weird hunches...

23:07.682 --> 23:09.616
...without telling us what's going on.

23:09.784 --> 23:11.046
It's crazy.

23:11.219 --> 23:13.483
You passed "crazy"
about four random clues ago.

23:14.822 --> 23:19.191
Ever since I read that newspaper article,
I've been having memories from 1 961.

23:23.798 --> 23:25.356
What?

23:25.533 --> 23:27.296
It's like some weird deja vu thing.

23:27.468 --> 23:30.198
Could it be like reincarnation?
You know, like past lives?

23:30.371 --> 23:33.169
-Chloe.
-Or genetic memory.

23:33.341 --> 23:38.005
Science has theorized that we store
our ancestors' memories in our DNA.

23:40.214 --> 23:41.841
Anyway.

23:44.552 --> 23:48.044
Well, wherever your hunches are
coming from, they're eerily accurate.

23:48.756 --> 23:51.725
I asked the Ledger to e-mail me
the newspaper's police blotter...

23:51.893 --> 23:53.861
...from the day missing in the logbook.

23:54.028 --> 23:56.861
Lachlan was released from jail
the morning Louise was murdered.

23:57.031 --> 23:59.556
He only spent a few nights
in jail for armed robbery?

23:59.734 --> 24:02.897
Yeah, and look at the name
of the deputy who released him.

24:03.070 --> 24:04.970
Billy Tate.

24:05.273 --> 24:10.404
Or affectionately known now
as our Honorable Mayor William Tate.

24:15.850 --> 24:18.250
Dex and Louise were my best friends.

24:19.821 --> 24:23.154
Arresting him was
the hardest thing I ever had to do.

24:25.026 --> 24:27.494
You bear a striking resemblance
to your great-aunt.

24:28.095 --> 24:30.222
Has anyone ever told you that?

24:33.067 --> 24:35.729
Do you remember booking
someone named Lachlan Luthor?

24:35.903 --> 24:38.599
He was released
the same day Louise was killed.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.674
It's hard to keep track
of all the arrests I've made.

24:41.943 --> 24:44.935
We think your friend
Dexter is innocent.

24:47.014 --> 24:50.780
Trust me, of all people, I wanted
to believe that more than anyone.

24:50.952 --> 24:53.546
But, finally, I had to admit
there was no drifter.

24:54.322 --> 24:57.086
He made up the story
to cover his own guilt.

25:11.105 --> 25:13.198
Careful with that, young man.

25:13.975 --> 25:15.636
Hey, you two lovebirds.

25:17.545 --> 25:21.845
-Billy, it's not what it looks like.
-Sure. Okay, big shot, out of the car.

25:25.653 --> 25:27.814
I don't know
what business this is of yours--

25:27.989 --> 25:31.720
You've overstayed your welcome.
Move along before you cause trouble.

25:31.893 --> 25:33.724
Billy...

25:33.895 --> 25:35.385
...he was just taking me home.

25:37.131 --> 25:39.531
You better make sure
this is what you want, Louise...

25:39.700 --> 25:41.895
...because I think
you're making a huge mistake.

25:55.116 --> 25:57.812
I never wanted to marry Dexter.

25:57.985 --> 26:01.853
Don't get me wrong.
He's a nice man. He's just...

26:02.023 --> 26:03.354
...safe.

26:03.724 --> 26:06.625
I made the mistake
of telling my father my dreams.

26:07.061 --> 26:09.825
I wanna go to Hollywood...

26:09.997 --> 26:11.521
...become a star.

26:15.102 --> 26:18.071
The next thing I know,
he's putting me together with Dex...

26:18.639 --> 26:20.766
...saying what a great wife I'd make.

26:23.477 --> 26:25.411
I finally gave in.

26:27.982 --> 26:29.472
And here I am.

26:33.688 --> 26:35.656
I think our fathers would get along.

26:39.193 --> 26:42.356
See, I'm not
what you'd call a model son.

26:42.530 --> 26:45.260
My father sent me here
as sort of a lesson.

26:47.368 --> 26:48.926
I didn't want to come here.

26:51.038 --> 26:53.006
Now I'd give anything to stay.

26:56.644 --> 26:58.168
But I can't.

27:02.216 --> 27:04.446
Then take me with you.

27:05.786 --> 27:11.452
We'll be like James Dean and Natalie
Wood in Rebel Without a Cause.

27:11.826 --> 27:14.954
-lt'll be romantic.
-I don't think you understand.

27:17.431 --> 27:20.889
When I said I wasn't from here,
I wasn't talking about Smallville.

27:26.107 --> 27:28.974
Where I'm from, we have colors
that you've never seen.

27:30.344 --> 27:33.507
Our moons are so close
they fill up half the sky.

27:35.449 --> 27:37.974
We have sunsets that last for hours.

27:45.726 --> 27:48.559
You almost had me there.

27:49.597 --> 27:52.623
For a second,
I was actually believing you.

28:26.367 --> 28:27.994
Oh, my God.

28:46.921 --> 28:49.048
So you want me
to dredge up an investigation...

28:49.223 --> 28:51.623
...that was put to bed 40 years ago?

28:51.792 --> 28:53.589
The mayor knows more than he's telling.

28:53.761 --> 28:56.355
Oh, yes, that mysterious drifter of yours.

28:56.530 --> 29:00.159
We think that Mayor Tate made a deal
to drop the charges on Lachlan Luthor...

29:00.334 --> 29:03.599
...if Lachlan killed the drifter.
They were gonna pin it on Dexter.

29:03.771 --> 29:07.434
Well, you make a great storyteller,
Mr. Kent, but not much of a detective.

29:07.608 --> 29:11.908
See, I will need two small things
called motive and evidence...

29:12.079 --> 29:15.571
...before I'm gonna haul the leader
of our community off to jail.

29:16.283 --> 29:18.808
The writing on the police log
matches this love letter.

29:18.986 --> 29:21.318
-It's the same signature.
-He was in love with her.

29:21.489 --> 29:24.151
With the drifter dead
and Dexter in jail for his murder...

29:24.325 --> 29:26.623
...Mayor Tate could have Louise
all to himself.

29:26.794 --> 29:28.694
I don't know if you
can hear yourselves...

29:28.863 --> 29:32.424
...but you might want to be careful
about who you're pointing fingers at.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.593
If you'll excuse me, I've got
a few cases in this century to attend to.

29:42.443 --> 29:46.436
Martha, we can't even tell
if these visions are for real.

29:46.614 --> 29:49.481
For all we know, they could
be just another test from Jor-El.

29:49.650 --> 29:52.813
Jonathan, when have you seen
Clark this determined for no reason?

29:52.987 --> 29:55.080
I know this is hard,
but we can't blame him...

29:55.256 --> 29:57.850
...for wanting to know
about his birth parents.

29:58.025 --> 29:59.686
Every time I hear the name Jor-El...

29:59.860 --> 30:03.352
...all I can think of is that we
aren't his real birth parents.

30:03.531 --> 30:06.500
We're just the people who were
lucky enough to find him.

30:06.667 --> 30:09.363
But right now he's here with us.

30:09.537 --> 30:10.902
Yeah.

30:12.072 --> 30:15.041
Clark. Have you had
any more of the visions?

30:19.380 --> 30:20.972
No.

30:22.383 --> 30:26.649
Listen, son, I'm sorry I doubted you.

30:26.820 --> 30:30.517
If you like, we can go over to McCallum's
barn, see if you missed anything.

30:33.327 --> 30:35.295
What is it?

30:37.565 --> 30:39.362
That's grandpa's gun.

30:40.034 --> 30:42.264
I saw it in the cave
when I had my first vision.

30:55.716 --> 30:57.741
I don't want any trouble.

30:57.918 --> 30:59.351
Easy there, son.

30:59.553 --> 31:01.521
You already got one murder
on your hands...

31:01.689 --> 31:03.953
...if you're the one
the whole town's looking for.

31:05.759 --> 31:07.556
I didn't do it.

31:09.496 --> 31:11.191
I'm not a killer.

31:11.899 --> 31:15.357
I loved her.
I'd never hurt her. You got--

31:15.536 --> 31:17.026
You gotta trust me.

31:27.514 --> 31:29.175
I'm Hiram.

31:30.517 --> 31:31.882
Hiram Kent.

31:39.793 --> 31:41.556
-What is it?
-The drifter was here.

31:41.729 --> 31:44.323
He was here on the farm
with Grandpa Kent.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.335
I haven't opened this...

31:56.910 --> 31:59.401
...since the day
my father passed away.

32:00.080 --> 32:03.208
Maybe something in here
will trigger another memory.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.150
Clark...

32:14.395 --> 32:18.331
...your grandfather wore this old thing
every single day of his life.

32:21.869 --> 32:23.894
It was his favorite belt.

32:29.777 --> 32:32.143
I wish you could have met him.

32:34.114 --> 32:37.277
Do you recognize
anything from your visions?

32:39.353 --> 32:41.821
At least you won't stand out
as much if they stop you.

32:41.989 --> 32:44.150
I know all the back roads.
We'll take them.

32:44.325 --> 32:47.692
I appreciate your help,
but I'll find my way on my own.

32:47.861 --> 32:49.556
I am not sending you alone.

32:50.531 --> 32:53.364
Are you sure these friends
of yours are gonna show up?

32:54.368 --> 32:56.029
They'll be there.

32:58.605 --> 33:02.507
You're welcome to stay
and try to clear this thing up.

33:05.446 --> 33:07.175
I've got no reason to stay anymore.

33:09.383 --> 33:10.850
Be careful.

33:14.121 --> 33:17.716
-Bye, Gene.
-His name is Jonathan.

33:18.359 --> 33:20.327
We're still deciding.

33:24.331 --> 33:26.094
Come on, let's go.

33:29.169 --> 33:30.659
Thank you.

33:33.707 --> 33:35.572
Grandpa helped him escape.

33:37.845 --> 33:40.040
Now, look, I'd like
to believe you, Clark, but--

33:40.214 --> 33:42.478
He wanted to name you Gene.

33:47.755 --> 33:49.586
After Gene Autry.

33:51.258 --> 33:54.853
We had all of his old records,
but Mom finally won out.

33:55.028 --> 33:57.462
Hiram was a pretty good
judge of character, Jonathan.

33:57.631 --> 33:59.531
I don't think he'd help a guilty man.

33:59.700 --> 34:03.158
Well, I don't think an old bomber
jacket is gonna prove anything.

34:03.337 --> 34:04.964
I'm not too sure about that.

34:37.871 --> 34:39.896
Sheriff Tate.

34:44.578 --> 34:48.139
Mr. Kent. I'm not sure how you got in,
but I don't find this very amusing.

34:48.315 --> 34:50.579
I think you've got me confused
with someone else.

34:50.751 --> 34:52.775
The police are on their way.

34:58.725 --> 35:00.454
Where did you get that?

35:00.627 --> 35:02.356
I knew you'd remember me.

35:02.696 --> 35:04.095
This can't be real.

35:04.264 --> 35:07.199
You've done a pretty good job
of hiding what's real.

35:07.734 --> 35:10.931
I know you made a deal
with Lachlan to kill me.

35:11.972 --> 35:16.375
But how did you feel when you
found out that he killed Louise instead?

35:16.777 --> 35:18.972
It was supposed to be you.

35:28.088 --> 35:30.989
You can't kill me.
I'm already dead.

35:31.158 --> 35:32.921
Mother of God.

35:33.126 --> 35:36.357
If you ever want
another day of peace...

35:36.530 --> 35:38.555
...you'll confess what you've done
to the sheriff.

35:38.732 --> 35:40.063
No.

35:40.634 --> 35:42.625
I'm not going to jail.

35:46.940 --> 35:49.238
You're not taking the easy way out.

35:50.644 --> 35:52.976
Mayor Tate. You okay?

35:53.146 --> 35:55.114
-We got the silent alarm.
-He's trying to kill me.

35:55.282 --> 35:56.681
Who?

35:59.887 --> 36:02.651
Lachlan was supposed to kill the drifter.

36:03.557 --> 36:05.889
I never meant to hurt Louise.

36:07.661 --> 36:09.128
I loved her.

36:17.471 --> 36:20.838
I never expected to see this day.

36:22.776 --> 36:26.143
It's still so hard to believe about Billy.

36:26.313 --> 36:28.941
Did you know he came
to visit me every Sunday...

36:29.116 --> 36:31.949
...for the first two years
I was in here?

36:32.119 --> 36:34.178
I'm sorry. I know he was your friend.

36:34.354 --> 36:37.482
I guess I always knew
how he felt about Louise...

36:37.658 --> 36:40.821
...but I never imagined
he could do a thing like that.

36:41.295 --> 36:44.822
And him confessing
after all these years....

36:46.934 --> 36:48.799
It doesn't make any sense.

36:49.503 --> 36:51.130
Maybe it had been haunting him.

36:53.040 --> 36:57.909
It'd be a terrible thing when love
consumes you and takes over.

36:58.612 --> 37:01.172
I was so in love with Louise.

37:01.348 --> 37:06.251
I just couldn't see she didn't feel
the same way about me.

37:08.555 --> 37:11.388
I wish I'd known when to let go.

37:20.500 --> 37:23.867
The explosion originated
in your family's apartment.

37:25.005 --> 37:27.872
There were traces
of ammonium nitrate, Dad.

37:28.041 --> 37:30.601
Your parents' death was no accident.

37:31.979 --> 37:35.107
Well, I've always suspected this. I--

37:37.718 --> 37:40.551
I knew my father had enemies, but....

37:41.922 --> 37:44.288
That's not what you told the police.

37:46.360 --> 37:49.227
I was young but never naive.

37:49.396 --> 37:53.230
I knew, automatically, that whoever
did it would be watching me.

37:57.471 --> 37:59.701
So you knew they were murdered.

38:01.608 --> 38:05.169
It's not like you
to pass up a chance at revenge.

38:05.345 --> 38:07.575
I had no resources.
I couldn't pursue it.

38:07.748 --> 38:10.376
Then. What about the last 30 years?

38:11.685 --> 38:13.744
I couldn't bring them back.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.286
There was nothing I could do...

38:16.456 --> 38:20.483
...so I chose to move on, forget about it.

38:22.829 --> 38:25.229
But you can't, can you?

38:27.901 --> 38:29.334
No.

38:33.607 --> 38:36.132
I owe you a thank-you, son.

38:36.710 --> 38:40.510
Your grandparents were murdered.

38:40.681 --> 38:44.242
They deserve justice.
Oh, I was such a fool.

38:44.418 --> 38:49.446
I always thought that their murder
could stay buried in the past.

38:53.593 --> 38:59.725
We both know that's not gonna happen
until we find out who did this.

39:12.312 --> 39:13.802
Clark?

39:16.316 --> 39:18.944
Lana. How's Dexter?

39:19.653 --> 39:23.180
I think he's just relieved that
his name has finally been cleared.

39:23.623 --> 39:25.614
Personally, I think I'd be more relieved...

39:25.792 --> 39:27.885
...knowing I wasn't getting
locked up again.

39:28.862 --> 39:34.562
I am not quite sure why, but I think Dexter
has you to thank for his freedom.

39:34.735 --> 39:37.135
You're the one who believed in him.

39:39.339 --> 39:41.000
Yeah.

39:42.642 --> 39:45.338
He was wrong about the drifter.

39:45.512 --> 39:47.139
I'm not so sure he was.

39:48.315 --> 39:51.842
Nothing would've happened to Louise
if she didn't fall in love with him.

39:53.820 --> 39:56.721
I know what Louise did was wrong...

39:57.724 --> 40:00.352
...but I can't help thinking
she was lucky.

40:01.695 --> 40:04.129
Even if it was only for a few days...

40:05.365 --> 40:08.823
...she knew what it felt like
to really be in love.

40:11.605 --> 40:15.666
-It's too bad it couldn't last.
-What if that's not the point?

40:21.081 --> 40:25.245
Maybe you have to be grateful
for the time that you spend together...

40:26.086 --> 40:28.213
...and stop holding on
to what could've been.

40:42.335 --> 40:45.304
What is it, Clark?
What are we doing here?

40:45.906 --> 40:47.271
I'm not sure.

40:51.611 --> 40:53.909
What are you doing with that thing?

40:57.818 --> 41:00.912
I was supposed to return
it to my father...

41:01.087 --> 41:03.487
...but there's too many
bad memories attached.

41:05.892 --> 41:08.019
Thank you, Hiram.

41:09.362 --> 41:11.523
I can usually tell
an honest man when I see one.

41:12.098 --> 41:16.592
Sorry you ran into trouble here.
There's plenty of good folks in Smallville.

41:17.037 --> 41:18.629
I'll remember that.

41:20.407 --> 41:24.434
Congratulations on the baby.
He's lucky to have you as parents.

41:25.445 --> 41:28.676
If there's anything you ever need,
you know where to find me.

42:15.795 --> 42:17.319
Clark.

42:19.266 --> 42:20.858
What did you see?

42:22.269 --> 42:25.295
He buried this here because he
didn't want his father to have it.

42:25.472 --> 42:27.565
It acts as some sort of journal.

42:29.509 --> 42:33.206
I think Jor-El was sent here
as some kind of rite of passage.

42:35.415 --> 42:37.940
Grandpa Kent was down here too.

42:38.752 --> 42:42.586
He told Joe that if there
was anything he needed....

42:49.195 --> 42:50.924
What is it, Clark?

42:53.333 --> 42:56.131
I don't think you and Mom
found me by accident.

42:59.072 --> 43:00.937
I think you were chosen.

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
