00:39.247 --> 00:41.708
Pick up, pick up.
- Yo.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.627
- I've been googling.
I think I have a dermoid cyst.

00:44.669 --> 00:45.754
- A what?

00:45.795 --> 00:47.255
- A dermoid cyst.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.133
Some of them
have hair and teeth.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.469
There's a chance
it's my embryonic twin

00:52.510 --> 00:55.722
who I devoured when we were
sharing our mother's womb.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.557
Take a look.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.894
- I think it's just a skin tag.
Hack it off.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.437
- Hack it off?

01:02.479 --> 01:04.856
Put the axe down,
Lizzie Borden.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.399
Ask Trey.
He's the genius.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.068
- Trey is sleeping.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.570
- Trey was sleeping.

01:10.612 --> 01:11.780
- Hi, hun.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.406
Jim just stumbled upon
some kind of growth

01:13.448 --> 01:14.908
under his arm.
- Hey, Trey.

01:14.949 --> 01:16.409
Weigh in on this.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.037
So far, we got skin tag
or embryonic twin.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.414
- Guys, not now.
I gotta sleep.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.083
- He's just psyching himself up
to cut the thing off.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.293
- OK.
Well, go get 'em, tiger.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.128
I'm rooting for you.
Night, night.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.589
- Do it if you can.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.882
And if you chicken out,
I'll come by tomorrow

01:30.924 --> 01:32.425
and cut off your junk.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.260
- I beg of you,
cut off my twin,

01:34.302 --> 01:38.348
but leave my junk.
- Please, make it stop.

01:38.390 --> 01:39.849
- See? See?
Trey agrees.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.686
We need a protest march
with signs and songs.

01:42.727 --> 01:46.815
Hands off men's junk.
Ooh, actually, bad idea.

01:49.818 --> 01:52.195
- It's Julia.
Please, leave a message.

[phone beeps]

01:53.697 --> 01:56.366
- OK, guys, I have resolved
to murder

01:56.408 --> 01:58.326
my long lost
twin little brother.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.287
So, if I die too,

02:01.329 --> 02:05.083
please donate
both of our bodies to science.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.210
OK, I'm opening the scissors.

02:19.848 --> 02:23.810
* The marriage that we once
had now is through *

02:23.852 --> 02:27.981
* And now we're doing
all that we can do *

02:28.023 --> 02:31.985
* To keep us all together
as a crew *

02:32.027 --> 02:35.989
* Trust, do as we say,
not as we do *

02:36.031 --> 02:40.285
* We really thought
that we were done *

* But we've just begun *

- Hey, babe.

02:46.624 --> 02:48.835
Look at my sleep tracker
which grades my sleep

02:48.877 --> 02:50.712
with stunning accuracy.

02:50.754 --> 02:53.006
- Ooh, 58.
That's good, right?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.674
- No, that's 58 out of 100.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.135
That's an F.
I'm flunking sleep.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.180
Why? Because lately,
Jim calls every single night.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.140
- To update me on the kids.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.683
- Well,
it starts with kid talk,

03:03.725 --> 03:07.020
but it always shifts
to other talk, Jim talk,

03:07.062 --> 03:09.481
about Jim things.

03:09.522 --> 03:11.399
Things Jim read,
things Jim's

03:11.441 --> 03:13.401
thinking of reading,
things Jim ate,

03:13.443 --> 03:15.737
things Jim thinks
Jim would enjoy eating.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.782
Jim things, Jim things.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jim things.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.827
Look, our windows
have blackout curtains,

03:22.869 --> 03:25.872
but what we need now
is Jim-out curtains.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.207
- I hear you.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.876
- I admire your commitment
to a thriving divorce,

03:29.918 --> 03:31.586
but I need my sleep.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.171
Please, I am begging you.

03:33.213 --> 03:37.676
Please, just tell him, "Jim,
don't call after 10:00, Jim."

03:37.717 --> 03:39.344
- Do I have to say
his name twice?

03:39.386 --> 03:41.846
- I think it conveys the proper
gravitas of this situation.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.057
- Two Jims it is.
I'll say it just like that.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.600
- Thank you.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.479
- I did not say it
just like that.

03:49.521 --> 03:52.399
In fact, I did not say it
anything like that.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.984
In fact,
I did not say it at all.

03:55.026 --> 03:56.236
I had planned to say it,

03:56.277 --> 03:58.321
but before I could,
fate stepped in.

03:58.363 --> 04:01.658
Fate sent me
a message on Facebook.

04:06.871 --> 04:07.247
.

04:07.288 --> 04:08.581
- Can you believe this?
19 years later, here we are.

04:09.582 --> 04:10.959
- I know.
I love Facebook.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.877
For every 600 friends,
there's actually one

04:12.919 --> 04:14.004
you want to see in person.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.423
[laughter]

04:16.464 --> 04:19.134
- So Australia.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.261
- Oh, great country.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.971
I just followed
the wrong man there.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.473
- You followed your heart.
Love took you there.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.683
- And hate brought me home.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.976
[laughter]

04:28.018 --> 04:30.979
- I'm just joking.
I don't hate my ex-husband.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.731
Actually, I hate my ex-husband.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.191
But you get it.
You've been through it all.

04:35.233 --> 04:36.818
- Still going through it.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.194
But it's good.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.113
We kept the apartment,
so the kids can stay there,

04:40.155 --> 04:41.489
and we're the ones
who come and go.

04:41.531 --> 04:42.699
- Well, that's smart.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.867
It's less disruptive
for the kids.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.744
- Still ironing out
the details.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.164
For example, Jim has been
calling a lot late at night,

04:49.205 --> 04:50.874
and my fiancé is not thrilled.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.543
But I always pick up
because he makes me laugh.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.919
- Well, if you're tired of him,
tell him to call me.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.671
I'm up all night playing
Words With Friends

04:56.713 --> 04:58.798
with people who aren't friends.
- [laughs]

04:58.840 --> 05:00.467
Well, if you're serious,
I'll set it up.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.137
- I wasn't serious.
Should I be serious?

05:04.179 --> 05:05.889
- Maybe.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.974
- You want to set me up
with Jim, your Jim?

05:08.016 --> 05:10.143
- He's not my Jim anymore.
No, no, no.

05:10.185 --> 05:11.519
I have relinquished all claim.

05:11.561 --> 05:15.065
He is now public domain Jim.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.524
- So it wouldn't be weird
for you?

05:16.566 --> 05:17.901
- Are you kidding me?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.903
I want him to be with someone
as great as you are.

05:19.944 --> 05:24.032
I mean, he's smart, kind,
charming, funny as hell.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.909
None of that changes
just because by the end,

05:25.950 --> 05:28.828
I wanted to stab him
in the neck with a lawn dart.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.456
But he's a great dad,
and he's a good guy.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.543
- Do you have a picture?
- Yes.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.505
Let me find a good one.
- OK.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.764
[upbeat music]

05:47.806 --> 05:50.600
- She said I'm cute?
What picture did you show her?

05:50.642 --> 05:52.894
Oh, yeah.
I do look cute.

05:52.936 --> 05:56.523
Hot, actually.
I am smoking hot right there.

05:56.564 --> 05:58.441
- Do you need to be alone?
- I'm good.

05:58.483 --> 06:00.860
But when you get a minute,
airdrop me that.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.446
Got a photo of her?

06:03.488 --> 06:05.990
Oh, hell, yeah,
I'll go out with her.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.951
- A photo is all it takes?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.285
- She's hot,
and she thinks I'm cute.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.788
That's what I call go time.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.791
- Mom, or Dad,
or whoever I should ask,

06:14.833 --> 06:16.793
can I sleep over
at Sophie's tomorrow night?

06:16.835 --> 06:19.295
- Sophie J. or Sophie K.?
- Sophie K.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.506
- Sophie J. will not be there?
- Uh-uh.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.342
- Look at me,
look at me, look at me.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.469
You promise me
there is no chance

06:26.511 --> 06:28.346
that Sophie J. will be there?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.433
- No Sophie J., only Sophie K.
I promise.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.019
- OK with you Jim?
- Yep.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.771
- Then have a lovely time.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.859
- It's Sophie Z.
you gotta worry about.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.320
- It makes me happy
you're going on a date.

06:44.362 --> 06:45.530
- Hmm, I'm glad.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.407
- And you seem happy now.

06:47.449 --> 06:48.575
- Did it seem like
I was not happy?

06:48.616 --> 06:50.118
- No, I just--

06:50.160 --> 06:51.995
you're a wonderful guy,
and I care about you,

06:52.037 --> 06:53.872
and I want you
to find your Trey.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.999
You shouldn't hide
your light under a bushel.

06:56.041 --> 07:00.378
- Never said my bushel
wasn't out there busheling.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.131
My bushel has actually
been very busy,

07:03.173 --> 07:07.469
and also, my peck.
- Oh.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.678
I wasn't aware of that.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.347
- Well, you know,
I like to be discreet.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.557
But yes, many dates,
uh, triggered

07:12.599 --> 07:15.560
by my magnetic libido.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.729
So, hey, do you think
your friend Lydia

07:17.771 --> 07:19.647
might be free tomorrow night?
- I can ask.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.941
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Jimmy.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.319
You know, it's been a long time
since you went on a sleepover.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.570
Why don't you call Trevor
and see

07:25.612 --> 07:26.780
if you can do one
tomorrow night?

07:26.821 --> 07:29.407
- Trevor G. Or Trevor H.?
- I do not care.

07:32.410 --> 07:35.205
- It's Trevor Z.
you got to worry about.

07:35.246 --> 07:38.625
* *

07:38.667 --> 07:41.044
- To first dates.
- Oh. Ow.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.545
- Are you all right?

07:42.587 --> 07:44.464
- Yeah, let me
just use the other arm.

07:44.506 --> 07:47.300
To first dates.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.677
Mm.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.470
Lydia, full disclosure,

07:50.512 --> 07:52.180
it's been a while
since I've done this,

07:52.222 --> 07:53.640
so I might be a little rusty.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.017
- Well, I wish this wine
had WD-40 in it.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.186
I'm just kidding.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.854
We're restarting the engine
after the car's

07:59.896 --> 08:01.272
been in the garage
for a long time.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.191
- It was a long winter.
- How was your winter?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.735
Because mine was cold and dark.
- Mine was dark and deep.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.112
- Mine was deep,
bleak, and dull.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.154
- Hm.

08:08.196 --> 08:09.406
[laughter]

08:09.447 --> 08:10.699
- Well, what doesn't kill us--

08:10.740 --> 08:13.785
- Wounds us so bad,
we wish we were dead.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.037
- I was gonna say,
"makes us stronger."

08:16.079 --> 08:19.374
- Hmm.
Tell that to my armpit.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.251
- I'm sorry, your armpit?

08:21.292 --> 08:24.004
- You want to know why
I winced a moment ago?

08:24.045 --> 08:25.213
- Sure.

08:25.255 --> 08:27.340
- Are you familiar
with dermoid cysts?

08:27.382 --> 08:29.801
- I am not.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.762
- It's a growth of skin cells
that sometimes gets infected.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.514
Sometimes they have hair
and teeth.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.641
And--
- Are you ready to order?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.935
- I think we need a moment.
- Certainly.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.061
- You know what?

08:40.103 --> 08:41.438
I can finish this story
after we eat.

08:47.861 --> 08:48.069
.

08:48.111 --> 08:49.154
- OK, so the other night,
I used scissors

08:50.488 --> 08:52.532
to hack off a dermoid cyst
that was under my armpit.

08:52.574 --> 08:53.825
- Lord, are you OK?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.452
- Yeah, I am now,
but it was brutal.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.371
I bled like a mother.
Bled and oozed.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.873
And overnight, the pus set in.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.459
I think it was lymph
leaking out.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.586
We have lymph nodes
under our arms, right?

09:04.627 --> 09:07.297
- I'm a tax attorney.

09:07.339 --> 09:09.632
- Well, anyway,
I was surprised.

09:09.674 --> 09:12.886
- I am too.
You scissored off a cyst.

09:12.927 --> 09:15.889
- Cyst is a polite word.
This was a commanding presence.

09:15.930 --> 09:20.268
It could start a cult.
It hurt so bad.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.395
- I can imagine.
- No, you cannot.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.607
I dropped to my knees,
not to pray,

09:25.648 --> 09:27.734
although I did pray
once I was down there

09:27.776 --> 09:30.487
for forgiveness
for murdering my twin.

09:30.528 --> 09:33.448
See, they think
that these dermoid cysts

09:33.490 --> 09:35.075
are fetuses
that the other fetus,

09:35.116 --> 09:37.494
in this case me,
devoured in the womb.

09:37.535 --> 09:40.121
So it was my cyst-er.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.878
- Jim, this was delightful.
- Was?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.880
- But I have to leave now.
- Why?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.423
- Because I have learned
to follow my gut,

09:50.465 --> 09:51.800
and right now,
I'm about to puke.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.178
It was very nice to meet you.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.139
Um, here's a 50 for the wine.
Keep the change.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.641
Put it towards your co-pay.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.813
I wish you well.
Condolences about your twin.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.272
I hope you don't get sepsis.

10:06.314 --> 10:07.607
Please tell Julia I said,

10:07.649 --> 10:08.775
"Thank you
for the introduction.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.151
"I am deleting my Facebook.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.404
"I will speak to her again
by accident

10:12.445 --> 10:14.197
in another 19 years."

10:14.239 --> 10:16.074
[upbeat music]

10:16.116 --> 10:19.035
- Jim just texted
that Lydia left the date.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.496
- Lydia?
- My friend I set up with Jim.

10:21.538 --> 10:24.457
- Oh, so a friend
you don't really like.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.292
- This jackass.
How hard is it?

10:26.334 --> 10:28.628
[line trilling]

10:28.670 --> 10:31.172
- Oh, if it isn't
the merry matchmaker.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.674
- What did you do, Jim?

10:32.716 --> 10:35.218
What did you do.
- Nothing. I was being myself.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.012
- And there's your problem.

10:37.929 --> 10:40.598
- You were being yourself?
Why would you do that?

10:40.640 --> 10:43.643
- It's too soon, Jim, too soon.
- Exactly.

10:43.685 --> 10:44.978
That's the first rule
of dating.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.939
You got to be someone else
first for a long time.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.816
- Yeah, everybody does, Jim.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.819
But especially you, Jim.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.654
- You got to trick 'em
into liking you

10:54.696 --> 10:56.281
before you let 'em see
who you really are.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.657
This is basic stuff.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.492
Just tell me
exactly what happened.

10:59.534 --> 11:01.119
- It was all going well,

11:01.161 --> 11:04.372
and then I told a story,
and she got up and left.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.291
- Which story?

11:06.332 --> 11:08.668
- About the dermoid cyst.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.795
- Oh, my God!

11:10.837 --> 11:12.714
- What?
It was hilarious.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.091
- There's something
really wrong with this dude.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.926
- Guys, guys.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.888
You live how you live,
and I will do the same, OK?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.349
Because guess what?
I met someone else.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.975
- What?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.144
- A lovely woman named
Thea Lynn, single and looking,

11:26.186 --> 11:27.854
who happened to be
at the next table

11:27.896 --> 11:29.356
and heard everything.
She's witty.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.899
She's attractive.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.401
She's festooned
in turquoise jewelry.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.028
She vacations in Santa Fe.

11:35.070 --> 11:38.948
And she loved
the dermoid cyst story, Julia.

11:38.990 --> 11:43.036
Wants to know what I would have
named my twin had he lived.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.704
She came over,
introduced herself.

11:44.746 --> 11:45.997
I asked her to join me,

11:46.039 --> 11:48.917
and we are having a blast.
Goodbye.

11:50.585 --> 11:51.878
Well, hello again.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.089
- I missed you.
Did you miss me?

11:54.130 --> 11:56.049
- I did.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.885
- I am having so much fun.
- Oh, me too.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.596
Oh, I figured out
a name for my twin, Lyle.

12:01.638 --> 12:02.972
- Love it.

12:03.014 --> 12:05.183
[laughter]

12:05.225 --> 12:06.518
- This is great!

12:06.559 --> 12:08.061
Jim met someone he likes.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.771
With any luck,
this will turn into something,

12:09.813 --> 12:11.314
and for a little while,
at least,

12:11.356 --> 12:12.732
I'm gonna get some sleep.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.234
Mission
accidentally accomplished.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.904
Come on.
- We are in desperate trouble.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.114
- How is this not good news?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.408
Why isn't anything
ever good news?

12:21.449 --> 12:23.243
- You don't understand.

12:23.284 --> 12:27.122
Jim has a defect in his brain
that makes him love people.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.289
It's horrible.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.041
The guy collects friends
wherever he goes.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.711
He's like a human lint roller.
- That's not horrible at all.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.213
That's good.
- No, it's bad for romance.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.049
Very, very bad.
Jim falls in love instantly.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.801
He fell in love with me
from down the block

12:39.843 --> 12:41.511
before I saw him
or said a word.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.930
- A, nobody can blame him.

12:43.972 --> 12:46.433
And B, for a long time,
it worked out.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.934
- Yes.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.687
Because as it happens,
I am wonderful.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.813
- Hmm.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.606
- But-- but that was just luck.

12:53.648 --> 12:54.983
You know,
I could have been a beast.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.484
I could have killed the guy.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.778
And now I may have.

12:58.820 --> 13:00.238
Someone's got to go down there
and get eyes

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
on this Thea Lynn,
do some recon.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.867
- Good luck.

13:10.290 --> 13:10.707
.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.666
- I don't see him.
Do you see him?

13:12.751 --> 13:14.169
- No. Well, I guess
that's a good try.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.129
We did everything we could--
- Excuse me.

13:16.171 --> 13:17.714
Do you happen
to remember a couple?

13:17.756 --> 13:19.632
He's handsome,
shaved head, beard.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.885
She was wearing
a lot of turquoise.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.096
- The guy who cut off
his oozing cyst?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.181
- That's the one.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.599
- Yeah,
they were in my section.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.225
- Did they leave together?
- Oh, yeah.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.644
They ordered our famous soufflé
and left before it was ready.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.564
- Excuse me.
You said he paid for this?

13:34.606 --> 13:35.774
- Yeah.

13:36.858 --> 13:40.528
[upbeat music]

13:40.570 --> 13:42.030
- Hey, babe, babe.
- What?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.323
- It's not too late
to turn back.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.283
- I've got to save Jim
from himself.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.368
- I disagree.

13:46.409 --> 13:48.036
But allow me a prediction.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.829
The moment you walk
through that door,

13:49.871 --> 13:51.164
you're gonna see
that it's an innocent date,

13:51.206 --> 13:53.041
and you're gonna want
to leave.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.001
At that moment,
I want you to look at me

13:55.043 --> 13:58.129
and say the word "soufflé."

13:59.464 --> 14:03.468
That'll be a signal
that you are, A, ready to flee,

14:03.510 --> 14:05.428
and B, I was right.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.222
- Oh.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.642
[giggles]
Your beard, it's so ticklish.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.310
Oh, a little more here.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.021
Ooh!
Oh, oh.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.817
Hey, um, do you mind
if I take off my dress?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.820
- Mind?
I'm honored, grateful.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.114
I'm already composing
a thank you note.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.953
- I thought you said
we were gonna be alone?

14:29.994 --> 14:32.038
- We were.
Julia, what the hell?

14:33.081 --> 14:35.291
- Soufflé, soufflé,
soufflé, soufflé.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.002
- Wait, who are you?

14:38.461 --> 14:40.797
- I'm Julia, Jim's ex-wife,

14:40.839 --> 14:42.757
former wife, wife at one time.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.634
This is Trey, my fiancé.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.137
- Hello.
- I'm Thea Lynn.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.680
- Enchanté.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.307
- "Enchanté," she said
as if she says it all the time.

14:51.349 --> 14:54.477
- Sorry for the flyby.
I had to get some stuff.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.354
I live here too.
Not all the time.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.689
Jim and I take turns.

14:57.731 --> 14:59.065
I leave stuff behind
now and then.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.483
And now and then,
I got to get it.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.235
Hi, I'm Julia.

15:02.277 --> 15:03.737
- Yes, you said
your name already.

15:03.778 --> 15:05.321
- That's right.
And she said hers.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.657
Thea Lynn,
which is so unique and pretty,

15:07.699 --> 15:09.409
like the woman herself.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.870
- I'm sorry,
you said you live here too?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.580
- On account of the children,
both of them, two.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.415
They live here all the time,
so they never need

15:15.457 --> 15:17.876
to get stuff, but I do.
Getting stuff.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.503
Can I offer you
a Diet Dr. Pepper?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.756
- Uh, no, thank you.

15:22.797 --> 15:24.716
- You know,
we call this place the nest.

15:24.758 --> 15:29.846
My son named it, you know,
because birds live in a nest.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.473
- But when they're all here,
it's crowded.

15:31.514 --> 15:34.434
So some of them have
the decency to fly away fast

15:34.476 --> 15:36.186
and far and away, away, away.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.064
- Look at all that
lovely turquoise.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.648
Why the turquoise, Thea Lynn?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.150
- Because I like it.

15:42.192 --> 15:45.236
- Why Santa Fe?
- You know about Santa Fe?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.571
- Oh.
[chuckles nervously].

15:46.613 --> 15:47.947
Jim texted that he had met you,

15:47.989 --> 15:49.657
and I texted him
with various inquiries,

15:49.699 --> 15:51.451
and then he texted us.
- Oh, no us.

15:51.493 --> 15:53.411
I didn't text anyone.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.163
- You were in the restroom,
I believe.

15:55.205 --> 15:57.207
- I was very happy
that I'd just met you.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.834
- What are your intentions
regarding my ex-husband?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.836
- Well, before you got here,

16:01.878 --> 16:03.505
I intended
to take my dress off.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.881
- Oh.
- I look back

16:04.923 --> 16:07.008
on that time fondly.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.094
- Well, look, I don't want
to get in the middle

16:09.135 --> 16:10.637
of what you guys got
going on here, so--

16:10.679 --> 16:12.138
- Yes, that's right.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.890
We're just here to get
the baseball glove.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.767
- And I have it,
and we will go.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.435
- Play ball!

16:17.477 --> 16:21.272
- But before we go,
uh, I'm sure, Thea Lynn,

16:21.314 --> 16:23.900
that you are a lovely person,
and that this will

16:23.942 --> 16:25.568
be a lovely relationship,
and that

16:25.610 --> 16:27.779
you will treat Jim lovely-ly.

16:27.821 --> 16:30.240
But if you don't,
be warned that

16:30.281 --> 16:32.117
whatever your motives,
whatever your schemes,

16:32.158 --> 16:34.411
whatever your pathology,
I shall thwart it,

16:34.452 --> 16:36.413
for I am his shield
and his sword,

16:36.454 --> 16:38.331
his bulletproof vest
and his rifle.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.624
- Julia.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.084
- I have his back
and his front,

16:41.126 --> 16:43.795
his side and his flank.
- Flank means side.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.132
- Regardless, I got the keys
to get in here anytime I want.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.844
- Uh, Jim?
- Yes.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.848
- Thank you
for a lovely two hours.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.183
- You're welcome.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.436
- Shorter than
many relationships,

16:59.477 --> 17:02.272
and yet, never to be forgotten.
- I understand.

17:02.313 --> 17:04.899
- This is obviously
a very complicated situation.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.569
- I know.
- More people than I'm used to.

17:07.610 --> 17:08.903
- Me too.

17:08.945 --> 17:11.322
- Well, uh, it was a delight
to meet you all.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.866
And Julia, bravo.

17:12.907 --> 17:15.285
You've saved Jim
from my sense of humor,

17:15.326 --> 17:18.246
my big heart, and my
voracious sexual appetite.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.373
- Wait,
Jim is a really great guy.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.625
- Agreed.
It's you I'm worried about.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.419
- Oh, don't be.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.839
- Any chance
I can still call you?

17:27.881 --> 17:30.633
- [laughs]
No.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.802
[laughs]
No, no, no.

17:32.844 --> 17:35.388
No.
No.

17:41.978 --> 17:44.356
- Huh.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.815
- Hmm.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.026
- Ay, ay, ay.

17:50.904 --> 17:53.323
- I--
- You?

17:53.365 --> 17:54.491
- I--

17:54.532 --> 17:56.618
- You?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.495
- Jim, I--

17:58.536 --> 17:59.746
I'm so sorry.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.414
- No one is more sorry
than I am.

18:01.456 --> 18:03.500
- What are you--

18:03.541 --> 18:04.709
what are you thinking?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.252
- I am not thinking.

18:06.294 --> 18:10.674
What you see on my face
is bafflement, wonder,

18:10.715 --> 18:15.470
awe, all mixed with
astonishment at the absurdity

18:15.512 --> 18:17.222
of what you've just done.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.016
- I just-- I don't--

18:20.058 --> 18:21.267
I don't know
what I was thinking.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.602
- Oh, I do.
- You do?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.521
- You were thinking
that I do my best thinking

18:24.562 --> 18:26.898
when you're there to remind me
what my best thinking is.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.026
- Look, you have
every right to be angry.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.195
- I'm not angry
because I know you,

18:32.237 --> 18:33.613
and I know you did
what you just did

18:33.655 --> 18:36.199
out of your own
peculiar and still evolving

18:36.241 --> 18:38.034
definition of post-divorce.

18:38.076 --> 18:40.453
- I think
I was just afraid that--

18:40.495 --> 18:43.540
- That harm would come to me,
harm that would be your fault

18:43.581 --> 18:45.041
because you were the one
who sent me

18:45.083 --> 18:47.002
on the dermoid cyst date
in the first place.

18:47.043 --> 18:50.171
But no harm came to me.

18:50.213 --> 18:52.382
And actually,
it was the opposite.

18:52.424 --> 18:54.384
Events conspired,
and moments ago,

18:54.426 --> 18:56.636
for the first time
in a very long time,

18:56.678 --> 19:00.390
I was caressed with desire
by another human being...

19:03.685 --> 19:05.812
Who, before you barged in here

19:05.854 --> 19:09.691
with your sawed-off shotgun
and your Kevlar vest,

19:09.733 --> 19:14.154
had decided without being
asked or begged to disrobe.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.075
Today was a thrilling,
if bizarre,

19:19.117 --> 19:21.578
reminder of life's
post-divorce possibilities,

19:21.619 --> 19:24.205
and none of it
would have happened

19:24.247 --> 19:26.041
if you were a normal person.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.546
So thank you.

19:33.048 --> 19:35.091
- You're welcome?
- Too soon.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.636
Now, if you've nothing else,
please leave

19:38.678 --> 19:41.598
so I can return
to Santa Fe in my mind.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.600
- No calls after 10:00.

19:43.641 --> 19:47.312
- What?
- No calls after 10:00.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.105
- Oh, uh, Jim,
there is one other thing.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.732
- No calls after 10:00?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.235
- The reason Julia tried to
fix you up in the first place

19:54.277 --> 19:56.154
is because I need my sleep.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.781
And we figured
if you had a girlfriend,

19:57.822 --> 20:00.241
you'd be less likely to call
in the middle of the night

20:00.283 --> 20:02.786
because you were busy
being caressed with desire.

20:02.827 --> 20:05.538
- I was gonna just call you
and say no calls after 10:00,

20:05.580 --> 20:07.749
but then things happened.
- Things?

20:07.791 --> 20:08.958
- Thoughts.
- Your thoughts?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.460
- Thoughts that led
to choices--

20:10.502 --> 20:11.711
bad ones.

20:11.753 --> 20:14.673
- But that's the rule,
no calls after 10:00?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.174
- If you don't mind.
- No problem.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.343
- Unless it's an emergency.
- OK.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.303
- If you got to, you got to.
- Thanks.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.263
- Call whenever you want.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.517
- Cool.

20:28.311 --> 20:32.023
- Love you.
- Love you.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.403
- Very fond of you.
- And you.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.157
Julia?
- Yeah.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.326
- Leave the cistern please.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.538
- Right.
- Thank you.

20:48.498 --> 20:50.166
- Oh.
Hi, everyone.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.003
Um, I didn't realize
you were here.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.213
Sophie J.
crashed the sleepover.

20:55.255 --> 20:57.173
She smelled like pot,
so I left immediately.

20:57.215 --> 20:59.009
Um...
[chuckles]

20:59.050 --> 21:02.220
I'm gonna go shower.
Uh, don't hug me.

21:03.805 --> 21:05.682
- See that?

21:05.724 --> 21:07.017
Silver lining.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.560
You know,
I don't show up tonight,

21:08.601 --> 21:10.854
your daughter walks in
on you going Southwest

21:10.895 --> 21:12.856
on the turquoise express.

21:12.897 --> 21:13.982
It's called fate.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.567
- Mm, no, it's not.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.153
- I tried.
