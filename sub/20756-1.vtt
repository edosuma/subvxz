00:10.344 --> 00:13.434
<i>Then people go,
"Goddamn, at least he's not a hypocrite."</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:18.020
<i>"You've got to give it to him,
that's the worst part of it."</i>

00:21.355 --> 00:22.355
<i>All right.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:26.570
<i>I ate a pork chop. I don't want to brag
or anything like that.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.815
<i>But it's in my belly right now
as we speak.</i>

00:32.866 --> 00:35.986
<i>And I realized that you...
you eat at a restaurant</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:38.248
<i>different than you eat at home, you know?</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:42.170
Like, at home you would never cook up
a pork chop on your skillet, you know,

00:42.251 --> 00:43.791
and make it nice and hot on one side,

00:43.877 --> 00:45.797
then turn it over,
make it hot on the other side,

00:45.879 --> 00:48.169
and then cut into it
and see how it's going in the middle.

00:48.257 --> 00:53.637
And then you go, "Man, I'm going to love
eating this delicious pork chop."

00:53.720 --> 00:56.600
As soon as it's hot enough to eat,
I'll eat it.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.062
But while I'm waiting,

00:58.141 --> 01:00.771
"I'm going to eat a big loaf of bread."

01:03.730 --> 01:04.860
Who would do that?

01:06.775 --> 01:10.485
"With, like, 35 pats of butter,
and I'll eat that loaf of bread."

01:11.989 --> 01:15.029
"And that will get my appetite
sharpened up..."

01:17.119 --> 01:18.499
"For the pork."

01:23.083 --> 01:27.593
I also noticed
that desserts are different nowadays.

01:27.671 --> 01:30.261
When I was young,
the waiter would come and go,

01:30.340 --> 01:33.640
"What do you want for dessert -
cherry pie or apple pie?"

01:34.219 --> 01:37.509
And you would go,
"I will have a cherry pie."

01:37.597 --> 01:41.097
And the guy would bring me... Very simple.
You know, things were simple back then.

01:41.184 --> 01:44.444
Now desserts - oh, my Lord!

01:44.521 --> 01:48.861
The guy shows up
and he's got a big tray at a canted angle,

01:48.942 --> 01:52.152
and every confection
known to man is on it.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.407
He's...

01:53.488 --> 01:55.068
And I don't like the way he talks,

01:55.157 --> 01:58.157
because he doesn't talk,
like, the pork-chop talk any more.

01:58.660 --> 02:03.460
All of a sudden, for the dessert,
he's, like, all the sexual undertones.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.540
You know, the...

02:05.742 --> 02:08.082
I mean, he's all like, "Ah."

02:08.836 --> 02:11.627
"Why are you saying 'ah' like that?"
He's like, "Ah."

02:15.469 --> 02:17.849
"May I tempt you with something?"

02:18.680 --> 02:19.680
"Tempt me?"

02:24.603 --> 02:26.233
"Do you like decadent things?"

02:26.313 --> 02:27.313
"Well, I don't..."

02:30.067 --> 02:33.357
"I hope you left some room in your belly."
"OK, listen."

02:34.696 --> 02:38.946
"Are we still talking about desserts here?
What the... is going on?"

02:40.327 --> 02:43.497
"I don't want to end up blowing you
in the bathroom or something."

02:45.666 --> 02:48.306
"I don't want to end up blowing the guy
in the bathroom. Listen..."

02:50.003 --> 02:52.843
I can be tricked
as much as the next fellow, and...

02:54.674 --> 02:56.304
I don't want to be in the bathroom.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.795
"Hey! Wait a second! Whoa!"

02:59.805 --> 03:01.765
"Hold on here, maestro! I..."

03:02.557 --> 03:06.057
"I thought we were talking about
a butterscotch pudding or something."

03:08.438 --> 03:11.898
"I don't care much for you, Captain,
I'll tell you that right now."

03:14.277 --> 03:17.197
"I'll continue, I'm a man of my word,
but I'll say this."

03:18.865 --> 03:20.275
"I'll say this, Chief."

03:21.952 --> 03:25.122
"Were my word not my bond,
then none of this..."

03:26.665 --> 03:29.455
"I'm doing it reluctantly.
I don't know if you noticed that, but..."

03:36.174 --> 03:37.264
Sex to me is...

03:37.342 --> 03:41.182
First of all, I'm an old man, you know?

03:41.263 --> 03:44.643
I... I'm like uh... threescore and...

03:45.642 --> 03:47.232
twelve, or something like that.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.398
I'm trying to get "score" going again.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.569
I feel that Lincoln,

03:57.654 --> 04:00.414
when he thought that up,
he thought that was going to go.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.620
You know what I mean?

04:02.868 --> 04:05.328
Like, his wife was like,
"Why don't you just say '87'?"

04:05.412 --> 04:07.412
He's like,
"Why don't you shut the fuck up?"

04:09.833 --> 04:12.543
"Last I checked,
I was the orator in the family

04:12.627 --> 04:15.547
and you were the fucking insane lady."

04:17.257 --> 04:19.627
"When I say fourscore and seven,
believe me...

04:21.094 --> 04:23.394
'score' is going to catch on big time."

04:23.472 --> 04:24.472
But...

04:25.265 --> 04:26.305
it never did.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.111
Here's another little presidential thing.

04:33.190 --> 04:36.610
You know there's a story
about George Washington,

04:36.693 --> 04:40.363
and they say,
"Oh, He chopped down a cherry tree,"

04:40.447 --> 04:41.527
when he was a little child.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.575
When his parents came home they said,
"Who chopped down the cherry tree?"

04:45.660 --> 04:48.410
and Little George said, "It was I
who chopped down the cherry tree."

04:48.497 --> 04:50.497
I cannot tell a lie."

04:50.582 --> 04:52.462
And you go, "Wow! What a great story."

04:52.542 --> 04:55.592
But then you think about it
a little bit, right?

04:55.670 --> 04:58.340
Imagine if you drove home
to your house, right?

05:00.175 --> 05:03.505
And you get there and go, "Hey, what
the fuck happened to the cherry tree?"

05:04.679 --> 05:06.389
"Did somebody chop it down or something?"

05:07.557 --> 05:09.017
And then you go inside,

05:09.100 --> 05:12.690
and there's your child... with an axe.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.280
So you go,
"What happened to the cherry tree?"

05:17.359 --> 05:18.649
and then he goes,

05:18.735 --> 05:20.945
"I chopped down the cherry tree."

05:21.613 --> 05:24.243
"I cannot tell a lie."

05:24.866 --> 05:26.196
And then you go, "OK."

05:27.494 --> 05:31.004
"The first part of what you said,
it bothers me a lot."

05:32.999 --> 05:36.499
"The second part
scares the fuck out of me. You..."

05:37.671 --> 05:39.301
"You can't tell a lie?"

05:40.966 --> 05:42.586
"You're incapable of lying?"

05:47.222 --> 05:48.222
That would...

05:48.765 --> 05:50.015
That would scare me.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.611
Now I live in LA. We go to parties in LA.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.359
And I go, too, but I'm no good at them.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.441
Here's my problem - I have no opinions.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.320
You know how people have opinions?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.448
I don't got none. I...

06:07.617 --> 06:08.827
Like political and...

06:08.910 --> 06:12.500
So sometimes before I go to a party,
I'll just turn on the TV,

06:12.581 --> 06:14.621
and whatever that guy said, I'll say that.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.455
But I'm not good...

06:21.548 --> 06:24.758
Like, when I go to parties,
I don't want serious discussions.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.893
I try to find somebody
that is at my same level.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.431
And I'm good at it. I can...

06:29.514 --> 06:33.894
Like, you know how they say guys have
gaydar - they can see other gay people?

06:34.436 --> 06:38.186
I'm like that
with guys at my same level of smartness.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.322
Like, I can see a guy
in the corner and go,

06:41.401 --> 06:43.901
"I can keep up
with that motherfucker right there."

06:46.156 --> 06:48.616
And then I make a beeline
for that character.

06:49.743 --> 06:53.083
And then we talk about <i>Jughead</i> comics
for a couple of hours...

06:55.206 --> 06:56.496
And everything's fine.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.881
Sometimes people go,
"Why do you even go to these parties

07:01.963 --> 07:03.673
if you don't like, you know, talking?"

07:03.757 --> 07:05.297
Here's why I go to parties.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.643
There's only one reason
why I go to parties.

07:07.719 --> 07:12.469
The reason why I love parties,
because I love those little sandwiches

07:12.557 --> 07:14.017
where they're triangles...

07:15.226 --> 07:16.896
And they cut the crusts off,

07:16.978 --> 07:20.478
and then they're
little equilateral triangles,

07:20.565 --> 07:23.065
and they put a little toothpick.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.203
And it has, like, golden cellophane...

07:29.366 --> 07:30.486
And red cellophane.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.785
I can eat 30, 40 of those fuckers.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.671
And you can only get them at parties.

07:36.748 --> 07:39.328
Like...
I have gone to restaurants and I go,

07:39.417 --> 07:42.917
"You got any of them sandwiches
that are shaped like triangles?"

07:43.880 --> 07:47.380
And they go, "No, all our sandwiches
are shaped like sandwiches."

07:47.467 --> 07:48.547
I go, "Oh, fuck."

07:49.052 --> 07:50.052
And then...

07:50.762 --> 07:52.602
I go to, like, a grocery store.

07:52.681 --> 07:57.141
I go, "Yes, where is... What aisle
is the sandwiches with the toothpicks?"

07:57.227 --> 07:58.647
They go, "We don't got none."

07:59.604 --> 08:00.814
"Have you tried a party?"

08:00.897 --> 08:02.397
I go, "I'm trying not to..."

08:03.984 --> 08:05.244
"Go to those things."

08:08.613 --> 08:11.743
But I don't drink,
so I'm no good at parties for that reason.

08:11.825 --> 08:14.575
And drugs, I don't do them. Used to.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.911
When I was a boy, young,
I would do anything, you know?

08:19.082 --> 08:22.752
LSD, that was about the strongest drug
I ever did - acid.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.706
I don't know
if you've ever done acid, but...

08:24.796 --> 08:26.546
When I was young, they would tell me,

08:26.631 --> 08:30.141
"You have got to be careful with
that acid, on account of you can do it,"

08:30.218 --> 08:32.217
and then you have a flashback.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.102
Like, ten years could pass,
20 years could pass,

08:35.181 --> 08:37.981
"and then you get a flashback."

08:38.058 --> 08:40.769
So I thought, "Well, that sounds like
a good deal," you know?

08:44.065 --> 08:45.565
I went to my drug dealer Frank.

08:45.650 --> 08:46.690
I said, "Frank..."

08:47.736 --> 08:50.736
is there a drug on the market
where I pay you $5...

08:52.240 --> 08:54.700
I take the drug, I get high,

08:54.784 --> 08:57.124
"and then, 20 years later,
I get high again?"

08:59.080 --> 09:00.210
He said yes.

09:00.290 --> 09:05.420
And I think of myself as somebody
who's good at stretching his drug dollar.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.298
But the point of the whole thing

09:10.383 --> 09:12.843
is for me to tell you young folk...

09:13.845 --> 09:16.805
that it's not...
it's not true at all, you know?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.730
Because I have not done LSD
since I was a teenager.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.149
Ten years have passed,
20 years have passed.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.978
Sadly, 30 years have passed.

09:26.149 --> 09:27.149
And still...

09:28.485 --> 09:29.485
no flash...

09:29.569 --> 09:31.109
What a gyp that turned out to be.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.196
I...

09:35.200 --> 09:38.830
Just more horseshit
by the big acid companies if you ask me.

09:38.912 --> 09:39.912
I don't want to...

09:40.622 --> 09:42.582
I don't want to get too political, but...

09:45.210 --> 09:47.380
If you think big acid...

09:48.463 --> 09:50.633
cares about you, the little guy...

09:53.009 --> 09:55.799
They care about
their third-quarter profits.

09:55.887 --> 09:57.257
That's what they care about.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.060
You know, my friend is a vegetarian.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.357
And have you ever been wrong,

10:08.441 --> 10:11.991
and you suddenly realize,
you know, like...

10:12.070 --> 10:16.450
Because she... all her arguments
are right about vegetarianism.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.083
She'll go, like,
"How can you kill an animal"

10:19.160 --> 10:22.210
when you can get the same
from the grass of the field?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.578
"It makes no sense."

10:23.665 --> 10:26.455
And then I go, "I like pork."

10:28.086 --> 10:29.086
So...

10:31.047 --> 10:32.417
Of course, she's right...

10:33.716 --> 10:34.926
and I'm wrong.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.971
And it's weird
when you realize you have been wrong

10:39.055 --> 10:42.765
about everything that you ever believed -
about vegetarianism, not everything.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.815
Imagine if you woke up and you realized
you were wrong about everything.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.359
You just woke up and you go,

10:51.442 --> 10:56.912
"Goddamn. I have been wrong about
every single thing I have ever believed."

11:03.163 --> 11:06.583
Then it's time to go down to
the rope store in my opinion, because...

11:08.751 --> 11:10.631
It's not going to get better, you know?

11:14.424 --> 11:17.344
Go to the rope store -
that's my suggestion to you...

11:18.761 --> 11:21.971
and get a hunk of rope about this big...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.556
and then go to the rickety-stool store.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.324
And, listen, it's no coincidence

11:33.401 --> 11:35.451
that the rope store
and the rickety-stool store

11:35.528 --> 11:37.568
are always right beside each other, right?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.195
I don't want to get political
or anything like that, but...

11:48.041 --> 11:51.381
When people commit suicide, no one
ever understands. You know what I mean?

11:51.461 --> 11:54.591
People commit suicide and people go,
"I don't understand why,"

11:54.672 --> 11:55.842
and I go, "You don't?"

12:01.763 --> 12:05.023
"What, do you live in a cotton-candy house
or something? What the fuck?"

12:06.351 --> 12:07.851
"You don't know about life?"

12:09.062 --> 12:11.112
"How it only disappoints and...

12:12.106 --> 12:15.896
gets worse and worse,
until it ends in a catastrophe?"

12:18.237 --> 12:19.357
"What the fuck?"

12:22.283 --> 12:25.833
There's two reasons
guys will hang themselves from the neck.

12:25.912 --> 12:28.162
One is, like we said,

12:28.247 --> 12:33.247
to escape this worthless masquerade
of a life we pretend we have.

12:35.463 --> 12:39.883
And the second reason we hang ourselves
from the neck is to whack off.

12:39.968 --> 12:40.968
These guys...

12:43.346 --> 12:44.756
I don't understand.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.017
It's called autoerotic asphyxiation.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.614
It's a big, fancy word,
but it's a filthy thing.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.281
And this is my problem with it.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.071
The risk-reward...

13:01.990 --> 13:03.320
Is not good.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.998
And I know of the reward
because I read about it.

13:08.079 --> 13:11.329
Apparently, by cutting off the oxygen,
or something like that,

13:11.416 --> 13:13.666
you increase your orgasm

13:13.751 --> 13:17.261
until it's
one-and-a-half times as powerful

13:17.338 --> 13:20.218
as the one you had
the Thursday before last.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.348
Is that really that important?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.482
I mean,
we have a lot of things in this country.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.400
You know, it's raining in the forest.

13:32.478 --> 13:36.688
There's all kinds of shit we have
to think about... let alone whacking off.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.114
That's our big problem?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.656
But the risk - good Lord!

13:50.496 --> 13:53.326
People always wonder,
"What happens after you die?"

13:53.416 --> 13:55.126
No one knows, you know?

13:55.209 --> 13:56.709
People pretend to know,

13:56.794 --> 13:59.674
but no one knows
what happens after you die.

13:59.756 --> 14:03.506
But I know what happens to you
right after you die.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.513
I know what happens
directly after you die.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.683
You are found.

14:15.313 --> 14:17.653
And this is where it gets tricky.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.531
And it's always by a loved one.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.571
You know?

14:24.655 --> 14:27.695
And you don't want your son walking in,
going, "Ah! What the fuck?"

14:28.618 --> 14:31.118
"What the fuck is Dad...
What kind... Huh?"

14:35.500 --> 14:37.960
And that's how you'll be remembered
forever, you know?

14:38.044 --> 14:40.554
It doesn't matter
what else you accomplish in life.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.676
See, people are under the misapprehension

14:44.759 --> 14:49.179
that their life is like a motion picture
that will be remembered as such,

14:49.263 --> 14:50.313
but it's not.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.180
It's just a photograph, you know?

14:52.266 --> 14:54.476
A still photograph,

14:54.560 --> 14:57.020
and that's unfortunately how it is.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.975
But, you know, like,

14:59.065 --> 15:01.775
if you think your son
will remember you as,

15:01.859 --> 15:07.159
"I remember my dad took me
to Disneyland in the blistering heat,"

15:07.240 --> 15:12.370
and, by God, he stood in line
to get Mickey Mouse's autograph.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.083
It took him two hours.

15:14.163 --> 15:18.213
"It was for me. He knew it wasn't
the real Mickey Mouse. He had to have."

15:20.461 --> 15:23.211
"It was an unemployed college kid."

15:24.674 --> 15:26.974
"And yet he stayed - stayed for me."

15:28.469 --> 15:29.469
"Dad."

15:30.680 --> 15:31.930
"He had two jobs."

15:32.014 --> 15:34.854
You know, to put food on my plate,

15:34.934 --> 15:36.694
"and my brother's and my mom's."

15:37.728 --> 15:38.728
"Two jobs."

15:38.813 --> 15:40.943
And I remember one time -
I'll never forget it -

15:41.023 --> 15:42.903
he came home late at night
and I was in bed.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.074
I was pretending to be asleep,
but I wasn't.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.163
And he came in,

15:47.238 --> 15:49.698
and he was very quiet,
and he came up to me,

15:49.782 --> 15:53.452
and he kissed me
on that area between my uh...

15:53.536 --> 15:56.656
my um... forehead
and the bridge of my nose.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.037
He kissed me right there,

15:58.124 --> 16:00.754
and he said -
quietly, so as not to wake me -

16:00.835 --> 16:02.415
'I love you, son, '

16:02.503 --> 16:03.963
and then he left.

16:04.046 --> 16:08.426
And the next day, I wanted to say
something to him at the breakfast table,

16:08.509 --> 16:10.339
but he was already out,
he was driving hack.

16:10.428 --> 16:11.928
"That was his second job."

16:12.889 --> 16:15.519
"But, my God, my dad..."

16:15.600 --> 16:18.310
Anyways, they don't remember that at all.
All they remember is...

16:18.394 --> 16:19.404
"Ah!"

16:19.479 --> 16:20.519
You know? Because...

16:28.571 --> 16:31.451
Unfortunately,
that's the way human beings are.

16:33.000 --> 16:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:44.879 --> 16:47.339
I think if I were to do it -
and I don't think I ever would...

16:49.008 --> 16:50.048
But you never know.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.391
You can't predict the future.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.852
I could wake up one day and go,

16:54.931 --> 16:58.271
"I want to have one of them orgasms"

16:58.351 --> 16:59.851
that's uh...

17:00.394 --> 17:04.404
"three-over-two times as strong as the..."

17:08.944 --> 17:12.444
"I knew that advanced-math degree
was going to come in handy sometimes,

17:12.531 --> 17:14.122
I just did not know when."

17:16.327 --> 17:18.577
This is what I would do
if it ever happened to me.

17:18.663 --> 17:23.583
I would disguise it
so it looked like an actual suicide,

17:23.667 --> 17:26.667
because then, when I was found,

17:26.753 --> 17:28.764
my son wouldn't go, "Ah!"

17:28.839 --> 17:31.379
he would go, "Oh! Oh, mysterious."

17:34.387 --> 17:36.347
"Dad's a mysterious guy."

17:37.682 --> 17:40.232
"This is going to be
a pretty cool story for me right now."

17:44.063 --> 17:48.033
So I would pretend, you know,
that it was a... it was a real suicide.

17:48.109 --> 17:51.399
Like, I would write a note -
a suicide note.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.487
Do you think this would be funny,
just as a practical joke,

17:57.577 --> 18:01.867
if you just wrote a suicide note
and just blamed some random guy?

18:02.707 --> 18:03.867
Do you think that would be...

18:04.792 --> 18:05.882
Do you know what I mean?

18:07.420 --> 18:10.130
You know, like, your barber
or something like that, you know?

18:12.425 --> 18:15.175
You go,
"It was all Ralph Abernathy's fault!"

18:18.973 --> 18:20.313
Because you know the police

18:20.391 --> 18:23.311
would be compelled
to go to Abernathy's barber shop...

18:24.562 --> 18:27.652
and go, "Have you ever heard of a fellow,
name of Norm Macdonald?"

18:27.732 --> 18:30.862
The guy goes, "Yeah, he would come in
every couple of months for a trim."

18:30.943 --> 18:34.863
"Oh, OK. Well, anyways,
he took his life because of you."

18:37.992 --> 18:40.622
"He wrote it here in this letter.
Would you like to keep the...?"

18:45.583 --> 18:49.053
Then Ralph Abernethy would have to spend
the rest of his life walking down...

18:55.593 --> 18:58.143
Life's hard enough
without having to walk...

19:07.813 --> 19:09.483
That's not a good practical joke.

19:09.565 --> 19:13.395
I should never have...
framed that as a good practical joke,

19:13.486 --> 19:16.066
because it's probably
the worst practical joke...

19:17.239 --> 19:18.239
You know?

19:19.241 --> 19:23.041
It's the kind of practical joke that gets
you raped by the devil for all of time.

19:32.046 --> 19:36.506
I uh came here from Las Vegas, Nevada,

19:36.592 --> 19:38.342
and when I was at the air...

19:38.427 --> 19:39.677
Uh...

19:39.762 --> 19:42.312
Where do airplanes go from? Airports.

19:44.225 --> 19:48.055
I was in the airport,
and guys were asking me for my ID,

19:48.145 --> 19:51.895
and it occurred to me
that ID is a strange abbreviation,

19:51.982 --> 19:54.692
because "I" is short for "I,"

19:54.777 --> 19:56.027
and then "D"...

19:57.071 --> 19:59.741
is short for "dentification," so...

20:01.992 --> 20:05.122
It seems to me
"D" is doing most of the...

20:06.789 --> 20:08.419
legwork on that one.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.093
But Vegas was cool.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.961
They have a motto in Vegas.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.917
They got their own slogan for the city.

20:17.007 --> 20:21.347
It says:
"What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."

20:21.929 --> 20:22.929
Which is not true.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.273
You know, you can't kill a guy
and then just leave, you know?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.846
They'll follow you, they'll find you,

20:29.937 --> 20:33.687
they'll bring you back, and they'll
try you in front of a jury of your peers.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.895
So I thought, well,
what does it mean, anyways, you know?

20:38.988 --> 20:40.408
And I ruminated about it,

20:40.489 --> 20:43.119
days and days and nights.

20:44.702 --> 20:48.872
Sleepless weeks
became sleepless more weeks.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.503
And, finally, it occurred to me.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.875
It was so simple.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.131
It was right in front of my face
the entire time.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.053
"Whatever happens in Vegas
stays in Vegas,"

20:58.132 --> 21:00.682
all it really means
is you can go to Vegas,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.180
you can have sex with a prostitute...

21:05.556 --> 21:07.726
And she will not tell your wife.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.476
They're very discreet,

21:13.564 --> 21:16.364
the Las Vegas prostitutes.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.491
You know?

21:18.569 --> 21:20.279
Not like these gossipy,

21:20.362 --> 21:24.332
small-town whores
back where you live, you know?

21:24.408 --> 21:26.238
These fucking blabbermouths.

21:28.037 --> 21:31.417
Down at the beauty parlor
with that pale blue thing over their head,

21:31.499 --> 21:32.789
whatever the fuck that is.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.876
"Oh, you're Marge Majerson?"

21:35.961 --> 21:37.461
You're Neil's wife?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.216
"Well, by God!"

21:40.424 --> 21:42.554
"I took a shit on him last night..."

21:44.470 --> 21:46.060
"In exchange for cash."

21:48.474 --> 21:49.684
"Nice fella."

21:54.396 --> 21:57.936
My favorite thing
is the magic phones that we all have.

21:58.025 --> 21:59.435
You know,

21:59.527 --> 22:02.397
not so long ago, phones were not magic.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.488
They were just used to telephone people.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.953
And uh... they couldn't take pictures.

22:08.035 --> 22:09.075
You know?

22:09.161 --> 22:12.121
If you wanted to take a picture -
this was only, like, 20 years ago -

22:12.206 --> 22:14.706
you would have to use a...
you couldn't use a phone.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.627
I remember I tried.

22:16.710 --> 22:18.590
"OK, just hold on there. Just..."

22:19.922 --> 22:22.222
People go, "What are you doing?"
"Don't worry, it's..."

22:24.760 --> 22:26.890
I was kind of ahead of my time,
but they thought...

22:33.644 --> 22:35.854
No, you had to use a camera,

22:35.938 --> 22:38.228
and then you would put film in the camera,

22:38.315 --> 22:41.185
and then you would go to a Fotomat.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.277
It was wonderful.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.071
And you would give it to this old man,

22:44.154 --> 22:46.574
and he would go behind some beads
and stuff, you know?

22:49.034 --> 22:52.234
And then you go, "When am I going to see
them pictures?" He goes, "I don't know."

22:52.288 --> 22:53.288
And then you go...

22:53.998 --> 22:56.708
"I'll phone you every couple of weeks.
How would that be?"

22:59.169 --> 23:03.089
And then, one day,
you got the news your pictures were ready.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.644
And so you brought your whole family,
and you all showed up,

23:07.720 --> 23:09.260
and you got that envelope.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.596
It was wonderful.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.271
And you opened that seal, you know,

23:13.350 --> 23:16.400
and then there were the pictures -
a whole handful.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.078
Like, you would go, "Hey, look at this."

23:18.147 --> 23:21.187
It's a picture of Aunt Ida,

23:21.275 --> 23:23.775
"but her eyes are red like the devil."

23:27.364 --> 23:29.124
"Maybe Aunt Ida's the devil."

23:31.660 --> 23:32.660
"Hey, look at this!"

23:32.745 --> 23:34.325
It's a picture of my dog,

23:34.413 --> 23:38.043
"but I put a hat and glasses on it
so it would look like a person."

23:39.084 --> 23:41.214
"It still looks
kind of like a dog a little bit."

23:43.297 --> 23:45.467
"Hey, look, it's a picture of you!"

23:45.549 --> 23:47.219
But look at your jacket and your hair!

23:47.301 --> 23:48.511
"Ha!"

23:50.220 --> 23:52.430
"Look at the way you used to... Ha!"

23:52.931 --> 23:54.271
"Remember that hair?"

23:57.353 --> 24:02.273
So you needed that time for the picture
to make any sense or have any resonance.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.404
Nowadays, you go,

24:05.486 --> 24:07.356
"Hey, would you like to see a picture

24:07.446 --> 24:10.406
of you standing right where you are
one second ago?"

24:12.451 --> 24:13.581
"I got one here."

24:15.746 --> 24:17.326
"Your hair is identical."

24:18.916 --> 24:20.286
"I guess it would be, huh?"

24:26.090 --> 24:27.760
In the real old days,

24:27.841 --> 24:29.721
they would take pictures like...

24:29.802 --> 24:32.552
At my house I have a picture
of my great-grandfather,

24:32.638 --> 24:34.008
and I only have one, you know?

24:34.098 --> 24:37.428
Back then,
they only had one picture of everybody,

24:37.518 --> 24:40.978
because they would pull that thing,
and it would explode and all that shit.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.863
And it was just my...

24:43.941 --> 24:45.031
Nobody was happy...

24:46.068 --> 24:48.568
because it took so long
to get your picture taken.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.744
So it's just my great-grandfather like...

24:52.449 --> 24:54.279
"How long is this going to take, sir?"

24:57.246 --> 24:58.906
"Who's going to feed them hogs?"

25:02.000 --> 25:04.670
"It damn sure ain't going to be Marjorie,
I'll tell you that."

25:10.509 --> 25:13.889
Do you know what else I like
about the magic phone? Wikipedia.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.845
Oh, have you ever used that?
That's the best, man.

25:17.516 --> 25:21.396
It makes a democracy out of smartness.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.112
Everybody's equal now, you know?

25:24.189 --> 25:27.229
Used to be
a guy would go to school five, six years

25:27.317 --> 25:30.237
and then he would talk to me,
and I would be like, "Uh..."

25:30.320 --> 25:31.320
But now...

25:33.073 --> 25:34.533
Now it's all different...

25:35.659 --> 25:38.159
because I have got my magic phone
in my pocket.

25:38.704 --> 25:41.004
So a guy will say to me -
he'll go, "Hey, Norm",

25:41.081 --> 25:45.961
you ever hear of a fella
that went by the name of Claude Monet?"

25:48.213 --> 25:51.513
And I go, "Why, of course I have."

25:51.592 --> 25:52.972
I got to go to the bathroom."

25:55.304 --> 25:57.064
And then I go to the bathroom,

25:57.139 --> 25:59.679
and I'm in there 20-25 minutes,
and I come back.

26:00.851 --> 26:03.811
I go, "Hey, listen, I was just uh..."

26:03.896 --> 26:06.726
We were talking about Claude Monet,
and I just wanted to say

26:06.815 --> 26:11.355
"that, you know, what I liked about him
was his paintings."

26:14.573 --> 26:16.953
"I like the way he painted."

26:17.034 --> 26:18.744
He was a painter,

26:18.827 --> 26:23.207
"and I loved how he used the paint
to make paintings."

26:27.377 --> 26:29.297
And then the guy goes, "Goddamn, Norm!"

26:29.922 --> 26:32.382
"I've never been able
to stump you in two years."

26:42.267 --> 26:45.267
But I looked on my...
Because I like learning on my Wikipedia.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.574
And I looked, because I was wondering
about fame, the nature of fame,

26:48.649 --> 26:50.979
because it's changed so much, you know?

26:51.068 --> 26:53.028
And when I was young it was one thing,

26:53.111 --> 26:54.911
and now it's a whole different thing.

26:55.447 --> 26:59.737
And uh I was wondering
how many people have been to the moon -

26:59.827 --> 27:02.157
like, have actually walked on the moon.

27:02.246 --> 27:05.536
So I looked on my magic telephone
and I found out.

27:06.166 --> 27:11.206
Only 14 - 13 or 14 -
in the entire history of the world.

27:11.296 --> 27:15.256
You would think
that would make you very, very famous.

27:15.759 --> 27:16.759
But no.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.599
The last guy who walked...

27:20.681 --> 27:24.141
Now, you think he would be famous
for being the last guy to be on the moon.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.056
His name was Harrison Schmitt.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.228
Now, whoever heard of him?

27:30.941 --> 27:32.991
Meanwhile,
he goes all the way to the moon,

27:33.068 --> 27:35.278
hangs around there for a while
and comes back.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.448
He's not famous,

27:37.531 --> 27:40.331
but a girl with a giant ass is famous.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.497
Now, when I was young,

27:45.581 --> 27:48.131
a man who went to the moon was famous,

27:48.208 --> 27:50.128
and a lady with a giant ass, you would go,

27:50.210 --> 27:52.460
"Can you stand over there?
Because this is..."

28:00.470 --> 28:02.140
Harrison Schmitt.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.311
So how many people that went to the moon
do we even know?

28:07.394 --> 28:09.154
There was... We know the first ones.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.269
There was Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.106
They went in Apollo 11 -
Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin.

28:14.192 --> 28:17.912
And even the third is hard to remember.
His name is Michael Collins.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.908
And Michael Collins,

28:19.990 --> 28:21.160
in one of the...

28:22.284 --> 28:25.334
just most unfair jokes -

28:25.412 --> 28:27.122
I don't know what it was -

28:27.205 --> 28:31.165
he got to go all the way to the moon
but not go on the moon.

28:36.506 --> 28:38.256
All the way to the moon,

28:38.342 --> 28:40.682
and then, that little rope ladder,

28:40.761 --> 28:42.261
he wasn't allowed to go down.

28:44.848 --> 28:47.518
He had to stay in the lunar capsule...

28:49.228 --> 28:52.728
while Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong
went on the moon.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.234
Michael Collins
just looking out the window, going...

28:57.027 --> 28:59.147
"Are those motherfuckers golfing?!"

29:03.909 --> 29:05.659
"Good God! They're golfing!"

29:07.329 --> 29:09.999
"Wait a minute, they...
they have got a dune buggy now!"

29:12.793 --> 29:16.883
"I was only allowed to bring so much
and they brought dune buggies.

29:16.964 --> 29:17.974
This is..."

29:18.507 --> 29:21.127
"I have to keep up
a good face, I guess."

29:26.181 --> 29:28.641
And then Buzz and Neil,
I'm sure they were nice guys,

29:28.725 --> 29:31.135
they didn't want to hurt Michael Collins,
you know?

29:31.228 --> 29:35.228
So they probably went back, you know,
to the lunar capsule, you know,

29:35.315 --> 29:38.935
and Michael Collins was like, "What do you
think, guys? What was the moon like?"

29:39.027 --> 29:40.527
And they were like, "Ah."

29:43.323 --> 29:46.543
"It was all right
if you like that kind of thing, I guess."

29:50.414 --> 29:53.674
"I prefer the lunar capsule myself. I..."

29:54.835 --> 29:56.795
"I can't speak for Buzz, but..."

29:58.380 --> 30:00.340
"I really do like the lunar capsule."

30:06.972 --> 30:10.352
Because that's what you do.
You know, most of your life is mundane.

30:10.434 --> 30:13.904
I decided to write a book, right?
So, it was a book about my life.

30:13.979 --> 30:16.149
They said, "Just write about your life,"
so I said...

30:17.349 --> 30:19.859
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.403
It turned out to be
the greatest comic novel ever written,

30:22.487 --> 30:27.987
but when it started
it was supposed to be a memoir, you know?

30:28.076 --> 30:30.696
A... An autobiography.

30:30.787 --> 30:33.787
So it makes you think,
"Well, what is my life?"

30:33.874 --> 30:35.424
So I started thinking about it, right?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.750
So I said, "OK, I wake up in the morning",

30:37.836 --> 30:40.166
and I eat some Count Chocula."

30:42.632 --> 30:47.102
And then I watch <i>Sports Center</i>
while I'm digesting my Count Chocula,

30:47.179 --> 30:50.179
and I phone my friend Fat Freddie.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.386
And I go, "Hey."

30:52.476 --> 30:55.936
You want to eat a cheese sandwich
or something around three o'clock?

30:56.021 --> 30:59.901
I... I got to wait
for my Count Chocula to digest,

30:59.983 --> 31:02.243
"but how does that settle with you?"

31:02.319 --> 31:05.609
He goes, "Yeah, great,"
so I get together with him.

31:05.697 --> 31:09.527
And on my way, I get some groceries
to bring home for later,

31:09.618 --> 31:12.908
and uh... and then, of course,
there's dinner, you know?

31:13.538 --> 31:16.498
So most of my life

31:16.583 --> 31:20.593
is finding and consuming food.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.008
So it doesn't make for a riveting read.

31:30.847 --> 31:33.137
It's incredibly repetitious.

31:39.856 --> 31:41.686
When you're writing, you learn a lot.

31:41.775 --> 31:43.855
I went to a guy who's a big writer guy.

31:43.944 --> 31:46.074
He told me about things
I didn't know about.

31:46.154 --> 31:48.164
Metaphors - have you ever heard of them?

31:49.741 --> 31:52.451
He said, "You have got to use metaphors."
I'm like, "What's that?"

31:52.953 --> 31:54.333
He was like, "That's a thing."

31:54.413 --> 31:55.753
So, a metaphor is like,

31:55.831 --> 31:57.961
'You can lead a horse to water,

31:58.041 --> 32:00.131
"but you can't make it drink.'"

32:00.210 --> 32:01.920
I'm like, "What the fuck does that mean?"

32:02.003 --> 32:03.213
So he was like,

32:03.296 --> 32:06.336
"That means you can take a person,
you know,"

32:06.425 --> 32:09.295
and you can give them
all the information and everything,

32:09.386 --> 32:13.636
"but he still has to be the one
to absorb it himself."

32:13.723 --> 32:16.693
So I was like, "Well, why the fuck
didn't you just say that? Like, what..."

32:19.062 --> 32:21.362
"Why did you have to put a horse into it?
Like, what..."

32:23.275 --> 32:27.195
"You thought I was so stupid you needed
to make it into some fable? Like, what..."

32:28.113 --> 32:29.363
"A horse?"

32:33.285 --> 32:36.955
"Or sometimes
the metaphor part of it is true,"

32:37.038 --> 32:39.368
but then the literal part is not true.

32:39.458 --> 32:45.008
They will go, like, 'That which does not
kill you makes you stronger, ' right?

32:45.088 --> 32:47.088
Now, metaphorically, that's true,

32:47.174 --> 32:49.934
like maybe a woman
breaks your heart, you know,

32:50.010 --> 32:52.180
or life deals you a bad hand.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.352
And then the next time
you're prepared for it

32:55.432 --> 32:57.932
"and uh...
and it doesn't hurt you as much."

32:58.643 --> 33:00.813
"But, literally, it's not true at all."

33:00.896 --> 33:05.186
Literally it's, 'That which does not
kill you makes you weaker...

33:07.486 --> 33:10.816
"And will probably kill you
the next time it shows up.'"

33:16.786 --> 33:19.536
That's why I like - personally -

33:19.623 --> 33:24.883
I like the ones where the metaphor is true
and the literal part is true.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.841
Like... They say, like,
"Beauty is only skin deep."

33:27.923 --> 33:30.013
I think that's beautiful, because it is.

33:30.091 --> 33:31.891
Like, you know, really,

33:31.968 --> 33:34.548
what makes a person attractive
is what's inside -

33:34.638 --> 33:38.018
their friendship,
their conviviality, their goodwill,

33:38.099 --> 33:42.309
not this uh... optic trick, you know?

33:43.396 --> 33:46.396
And so it has that,
but also, literally it's true,

33:46.483 --> 33:50.533
because you could be
the handsomest guy in the world, you know?

33:50.612 --> 33:53.742
You could have, like, this chiseled jaw

33:53.823 --> 33:57.243
and beautiful,
thick mane of hair, you know?

33:57.786 --> 34:00.866
Large shoulders and narrow waist.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.116
Are you guys horny?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.670
Is it just me, or...?

34:08.964 --> 34:11.424
Giant quads, a perfect body.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.138
Six percent body fat, you know?

34:17.429 --> 34:20.139
But you take that same guy

34:20.225 --> 34:21.344
and you skin him.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.572
All of a sudden...

34:34.155 --> 34:36.945
he is not so easy on the eye.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.248
I'm getting old, you know?

34:50.297 --> 34:53.427
I asked my doctor...
This is interesting, because I wondered...

34:53.507 --> 34:56.598
You know,
I know the first two causes of death -

34:56.678 --> 34:59.098
heart disease and cancer,

34:59.180 --> 35:01.060
neck and neck, you know, to kill you.

35:01.141 --> 35:05.441
So I said to the doctor, "What's
the third most common cause of death?"

35:05.520 --> 35:06.650
What is the third?"

35:06.730 --> 35:09.860
And he said, "Complications."

35:11.443 --> 35:13.953
That's...
That's like the doctor fucking up.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.199
Like, how is that the third?

35:15.864 --> 35:17.074
That's the third?

35:20.827 --> 35:25.957
You go, "Hey, Doc, I can't help
but noticing my father is dead uh..."

35:27.417 --> 35:31.167
"And I remember yesterday
you said it was a simple operation."

35:32.130 --> 35:34.670
And he was like,
"Yeah, we thought it was."

35:35.675 --> 35:37.715
"Looked simple in the book,
I'll tell you that."

35:38.553 --> 35:42.773
"But uh...
you cut open a man, by God, it's..."

35:44.309 --> 35:46.809
"All this red stringy stuff
and everything."

35:48.438 --> 35:49.648
"Are you a doctor?" "No."

35:49.731 --> 35:51.441
"Ah, you wouldn't have heard.

35:51.524 --> 35:53.324
Way too complicated for you."

35:56.196 --> 35:58.196
But you worry when you get old, you know?

35:58.281 --> 36:00.951
You get concerned, scared.

36:02.535 --> 36:04.365
I remember my grandmother, you know,

36:04.454 --> 36:07.874
she was like... I think she was like 85
at the time or something,

36:07.957 --> 36:11.667
and I looked at her - she was sitting in
her chair - and I said, "Hey, Grandma."

36:11.753 --> 36:13.003
She had a bruise, right?

36:13.088 --> 36:15.168
And it went from her... from her wrist,

36:15.256 --> 36:18.426
all the way up her arm,
right to her shoulder.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.100
A big bruise -

36:20.178 --> 36:23.258
purple, green and yellow.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.056
A third of each.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.482
And I said...

36:27.560 --> 36:31.190
I said,
"Grandma, where did you get that bruise?"

36:31.272 --> 36:34.072
and then my grandmother said, "The wind."

36:37.821 --> 36:39.071
I said, "The wind?"

36:40.949 --> 36:44.199
And she said, "Yes. Do you remember
that gentle breeze yesterday?"

36:46.204 --> 36:47.754
I was like, "Yeah, I remember."

36:53.169 --> 36:55.129
My parents were teachers,

36:55.213 --> 36:57.883
which is a noble profession,
everyone says.

37:00.201 --> 37:02.221
They're fine people.
But do you know what's weird?

37:02.303 --> 37:04.853
They all say,
"Teachers are the real heroes."

37:04.931 --> 37:07.481
My folks - not heroic at all.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.147
And, as a matter of fact,

37:11.229 --> 37:15.319
I have never met a teacher
that showed any heroism.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.323
And I have known a lot of teachers,

37:18.403 --> 37:21.363
because I was a student
for years and years.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.704
And never once did I go,
"Hey, Barney, man,"

37:25.785 --> 37:28.405
I was just looking at old man Abernathy,

37:28.496 --> 37:33.246
you know, at the way he was erasing
that chalk on the chalkboard,

37:33.334 --> 37:34.964
where he put the chalk earlier...

37:36.129 --> 37:38.879
"and I was thinking,
he cuts a heroic figure, doesn't he?"

37:40.383 --> 37:43.603
"No? Me neither. I didn't think that,
either. I just heard that somewhere."

37:48.349 --> 37:52.059
And it's not that hard a job when you
think about it. You know what I mean?

37:54.981 --> 37:56.111
Like, it's a pretty good...

37:56.191 --> 37:58.321
If you have a job where you go to work -

37:58.401 --> 38:00.361
like Grade 3 - you go to work,

38:00.445 --> 38:04.025
and you're 50 times bigger
than everybody else that you work with...

38:05.233 --> 38:06.483
That's a pretty good job.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.792
Plus, they do all the work.

38:11.331 --> 38:12.791
You do nothing.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.044
That's...

38:16.169 --> 38:17.339
How about the students?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.420
How about giving some of them
the "heroism"?

38:19.506 --> 38:20.506
You know, the...

38:22.050 --> 38:24.510
five-year-olds that are working for free.

38:28.932 --> 38:31.232
What do you need, really,
to be a teacher, anyway?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.979
What's the, you know, qualifications?

38:34.062 --> 38:36.402
Let's say you're teaching the Third grade.

38:36.481 --> 38:37.691
What... What do you need?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.114
A Fourth-grade education.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.992
Really, anything above that...

38:43.446 --> 38:45.616
You're overqualified, really, you know?

38:49.786 --> 38:50.996
I didn't like school.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.419
I liked before school.

38:54.499 --> 38:55.999
Man, do you remember that?

38:56.084 --> 38:57.634
Before you had to go to school.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.380
Man, that was the greatest time ever.
I'll never forget it.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.882
Those were my finest days, man.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.466
I loved them so much.

39:04.551 --> 39:07.141
I remember, like,
I would go over to Shawn Kay's house,

39:07.220 --> 39:08.560
and I would have a stick,

39:08.638 --> 39:10.178
and that would be the whole day.

39:12.183 --> 39:15.273
I would go, "Shawn, I've got a stick!"
He would go, "Goddamn! We'll go play."

39:16.938 --> 39:18.358
It was so much fun.

39:19.065 --> 39:21.355
And then, one day, suddenly I'm in school.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.952
They were dragging me in,
and I remember there were tears and...

39:25.572 --> 39:26.872
I'm like, "What the fuck?"

39:28.449 --> 39:30.869
There were these windows
that made it even...

39:30.952 --> 39:32.502
You would look out the window

39:32.579 --> 39:35.159
and sometimes
you would see the stick, you know?

39:36.457 --> 39:37.577
And you would go, "Goddamn!"

39:37.667 --> 39:40.957
Do these people's cruelty
know no offense?"

39:45.925 --> 39:49.795
Nowadays, you know,
they have the ADD and stuff like that.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.768
For kids in class who are like,
"Hey, I would like to go out!"

39:52.849 --> 39:54.519
they go, "We're going to drug you."

39:57.645 --> 39:59.355
"Then you won't want to get out...

40:00.648 --> 40:03.478
and run around in the grass
and have fun with the stick."

40:05.153 --> 40:06.913
"You'll be fine. You'll be good."

40:10.074 --> 40:12.914
But, anyways, I'm old now, you know?

40:12.994 --> 40:14.044
I was young.

40:15.872 --> 40:16.922
Now I am old.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.344
Yeah.

40:22.295 --> 40:23.875
I learned some things in school.

40:23.963 --> 40:26.343
Now that I'm old,
things scare me, you know?

40:26.424 --> 40:28.134
I think it's the media that does it.

40:28.217 --> 40:32.057
Like, they go, "North Korea," you know?
And, I don't know, it kind of scares...

40:32.138 --> 40:35.768
It doesn't scare me that much,
but... it's supposed to scare you.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.480
But, like, are you really scared?

40:37.560 --> 40:40.230
Have you ever woken up, gone, "Ah!"
and your wife says, "What?!"

40:40.313 --> 40:41.313
"North Korea!"

40:43.024 --> 40:45.744
That little, tiny country,
way the fuck over somewhere.

40:48.529 --> 40:50.279
"I'm scared, honey. I'm scared."

40:53.952 --> 40:54.952
I'll tell you,

40:55.036 --> 40:58.116
Iraq doesn't scare me, North Korea -
none of those countries scare me.

40:58.206 --> 41:02.836
There's only one country, really,
that scares me in the whole country.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.049
Or in the whole...

41:04.128 --> 41:07.338
What do you call that's bigger than
a country but less than a galaxy?

41:09.217 --> 41:10.217
Earth.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.675
The entire earth, there's only one country
that frightens me -

41:13.763 --> 41:15.263
that's the country of Germany.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.767
I don't know if you guys
are students of history or not, but...

41:23.398 --> 41:24.818
For those of you who aren't,

41:24.899 --> 41:26.569
Germany,

41:26.651 --> 41:29.951
in the previous century -
in the early part...

41:30.655 --> 41:32.775
they decided to go to war.

41:32.865 --> 41:34.905
And who did they choose to go to war with?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.333
The world.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.213
So you think
that would last about five seconds

41:44.293 --> 41:46.803
and the world would fucking win,
and that would be that.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.514
But it was actually close.

41:49.590 --> 41:50.590
And then...

41:51.300 --> 41:53.050
I don't know how that worked, but...

41:54.762 --> 41:57.562
Then 30 years pass,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.020
and Germany decides to go to war again.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.561
And, once again,
they choose as their foe...

42:04.397 --> 42:05.397
the world!

42:05.440 --> 42:06.440
And now...

42:07.316 --> 42:09.566
this time, they really almost win.

42:10.987 --> 42:13.067
So at this point
you would think the world would go,

42:13.156 --> 42:16.196
"Germany, you're fucking not a country
any more, all right?"

42:17.368 --> 42:18.368
"What the fuck?"

42:21.039 --> 42:24.669
"You're not a country because you keep
going to war with the world,"

42:24.751 --> 42:26.881
and... no one does...

42:26.961 --> 42:28.671
"What do you think you are, Mars?"

42:31.090 --> 42:33.050
"Do you think you're Mars or something?"

42:40.433 --> 42:42.233
But it's fun to get old, you know?

42:44.353 --> 42:46.313
You start watching old things.

42:47.648 --> 42:51.068
You know those commercials
that are toward old people?

42:51.152 --> 42:54.322
I was watching, for instance, on MeTV,
I was watching uh...

42:54.405 --> 42:56.905
<i>The Six Million Dollar Man,</i> right?

42:56.991 --> 43:00.871
And he was in Paris, jumping over the
Arc de Triomphe and everything like that.

43:00.953 --> 43:04.963
And then, just by luck or coincidence,

43:05.041 --> 43:06.671
they went to a commercial,

43:06.751 --> 43:10.921
and it was a commercial
starring Lee Majors,

43:11.005 --> 43:12.715
the Six Million Dollar Man,

43:12.799 --> 43:15.509
but as he is today, like an old man.

43:16.385 --> 43:19.675
So he's jumping over...
And it was for the bionic ear.

43:22.266 --> 43:24.726
And it wasn't the real bionic ear
from the show,

43:24.811 --> 43:26.401
it was a fucking hearing aid.

43:29.023 --> 43:32.573
So you see him jumping over
the Arc de Triomphe,

43:32.652 --> 43:34.822
and then it cuts,
and he's in a studio, like,

43:34.904 --> 43:36.534
"I can't hear too good out of..."

43:38.866 --> 43:40.196
"This one's no good at all.

43:40.284 --> 43:41.544
This one's all right."

43:43.955 --> 43:46.575
"This one may as well not even be an ear."

43:48.000 --> 43:49.250
And you go, "Goddamn."

43:49.335 --> 43:52.255
You can't help but feel sorry
for a man like that.

43:52.755 --> 43:57.425
Because you know, at one time, he got
a phone call from his agent, you know?

43:57.510 --> 43:59.930
And he probably had
all kinds of hope, you know?

44:00.012 --> 44:04.232
He answers, "Hey, Jerome! My God!
I haven't heard from you in 30 years."

44:05.476 --> 44:07.726
"You've got something for me?
Well, let me guess."

44:07.812 --> 44:09.652
I bet I know what it is.

44:09.730 --> 44:11.190
It's that movie I wrote:

44:11.274 --> 44:14.194
<i>The Return
Of The Six Million Dollar Man...</i>

44:15.027 --> 44:17.197
starring Ben Stiller.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.490
"And then I show up
as a judge for two minutes."

44:21.951 --> 44:22.951
"Is that the one?"

44:23.619 --> 44:25.659
"No? What is it, then?"

44:26.414 --> 44:27.464
"It's a...

44:27.540 --> 44:29.130
No, not out of this one. No."

44:32.128 --> 44:33.128
"Well, what..."

44:34.380 --> 44:35.380
"What is that?"

44:36.007 --> 44:37.427
"That's a hearing aid?"

44:39.594 --> 44:40.764
"Well...

44:42.180 --> 44:44.890
how much does something like that
pay a fellow?"

44:47.560 --> 44:49.520
"It's funny you say that, Jerome,"

44:49.604 --> 44:50.944
because when you say it,

44:51.022 --> 44:55.862
I realize that that's only one tenth

44:55.943 --> 44:59.663
of what I used to get
from a single episode of...

44:59.739 --> 45:01.819
"No, I'll keep... I won't... Sorry."

45:03.826 --> 45:05.076
"Um...

45:05.161 --> 45:06.751
When do they have to know by?"

45:07.288 --> 45:09.168
"Oh, within the hour, huh?"

45:10.207 --> 45:11.787
"Well uh..."

45:12.376 --> 45:14.916
I guess, then, I would say um...

45:15.004 --> 45:16.304
"Yes, I'll take that."

45:19.884 --> 45:21.394
"Jerome, I have to ask you this."

45:21.469 --> 45:23.469
Is there any way in the contract

45:23.554 --> 45:26.184
that you can put in that um...

45:27.892 --> 45:29.062
"I'm sad?"

45:52.291 --> 45:54.251
What about those commercials...

45:54.335 --> 45:56.495
Where the guy
just tells you stuff you already know?

45:56.587 --> 45:58.417
There's this one with William Devane,

45:58.506 --> 46:00.296
and he goes, "Do you like gold?"

46:00.383 --> 46:01.883
You're like, "Yes, of course."

46:05.012 --> 46:07.682
"You should buy a big bar of gold
and put it in your safe."

46:07.765 --> 46:10.095
You go, "Well, I wish I could.
That would be very nice."

46:12.019 --> 46:14.149
"Do you know gold's always been valuable?"

46:14.230 --> 46:16.480
"Yes, I know everything
you're telling me."

46:18.067 --> 46:20.737
"Daffy Duck told me that
when I was a little kid.

46:20.820 --> 46:23.320
I know all about how gold is valuable."

46:28.536 --> 46:31.496
There's one that I don't understand,
but it's kind of...

46:31.580 --> 46:33.670
It's called "reverse mortgage."

46:35.126 --> 46:36.876
I had never heard of one of these things.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.298
It has a guy on it, and he goes,

46:39.380 --> 46:40.800
"I'm a guy..."

46:43.009 --> 46:45.889
And I want to tell you about
reverse mortgages.

46:45.970 --> 46:49.930
"You've probably never heard of them,
but you all know what a mortgage is."

46:50.558 --> 46:53.768
"That's when you and your loved one,"

46:53.853 --> 46:55.773
you get together a grubstake -

46:55.855 --> 46:57.895
you know, a little bit of money -

46:57.982 --> 47:03.032
and, by God, you put it down
on a piece of land or a house, you know?

47:03.112 --> 47:07.782
And then, every month, you pay
what's called a mortgage, you know?

47:07.867 --> 47:09.947
Which is some money to the bank.

47:10.036 --> 47:12.156
And then 20 years pass, or 30,

47:12.246 --> 47:15.286
and you have a big party
with your friends.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.674
All your kith and kin come,

47:17.752 --> 47:19.592
and you burn the mortgage,

47:19.670 --> 47:20.960
and, by God,

47:21.047 --> 47:25.427
"you own a piece of the American dream."

47:26.427 --> 47:28.507
"Anyway, this is the complete opposite."

47:31.766 --> 47:32.766
"So uh..."

47:34.060 --> 47:36.520
we would be glad
to send you some brochures.

47:36.604 --> 47:37.614
"It's uh..."

47:40.483 --> 47:42.943
"It's a picture of you with no shelter."

47:59.126 --> 48:00.916
You know,
I'm trying to be a better person.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.633
I don't know if you're religious or not.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.303
I'm sort of half religious, half not.

48:04.381 --> 48:05.671
I try to uh...

48:06.717 --> 48:08.047
obey the commandments.

48:08.552 --> 48:11.892
And it's funny that some of the
commandments are very easy to obey,

48:11.972 --> 48:13.392
and some are very difficult.

48:13.474 --> 48:16.694
You know what I'm saying?
Like, "Thou shalt not kill."

48:17.269 --> 48:20.309
Well, it's pretty easy
to obey that, you know?

48:20.397 --> 48:23.147
But then there's other ones
that are really hard to obey,

48:23.234 --> 48:24.574
like there's one that says,

48:24.652 --> 48:29.412
"Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's ox."

48:32.910 --> 48:33.910
Now...

48:35.079 --> 48:37.999
I have this old scraggly fucking ox.

48:43.212 --> 48:45.632
I bought him used -
that was my first mistake.

48:47.091 --> 48:49.141
And uh... the guy who sold it to me

48:49.218 --> 48:52.428
didn't tell me about
all the fucking diseases this thing has.

48:53.305 --> 48:55.015
So he fucking wanders around.

48:55.099 --> 48:57.139
He can't pull anything.

48:59.019 --> 49:02.399
And he has a big thing around his neck,

49:02.481 --> 49:04.691
like a bell, and that causes him...

49:05.901 --> 49:07.991
neck problems, so I have to take that off.

49:08.070 --> 49:09.070
And then...

49:09.655 --> 49:12.315
Then I walk past my neighbor's house,

49:12.408 --> 49:14.288
and I look in his garage,

49:14.368 --> 49:18.748
and here stands the most beautiful...

49:22.501 --> 49:24.961
like, blue-grey...

49:26.213 --> 49:28.593
Belgian ox...

49:30.009 --> 49:32.469
that I've ever laid eyes upon.

49:32.553 --> 49:35.473
And he's brushing his lustrous...

49:38.350 --> 49:40.140
And I'm not supposed to covet it? I...

49:46.650 --> 49:48.860
"Thou shalt not bear false witness."

49:48.944 --> 49:50.034
That's a tough one.

49:50.112 --> 49:51.782
But it's good, you know, not to lie,

49:51.864 --> 49:54.494
but it's very, very hard, you know,

49:54.575 --> 49:57.785
not lying,
because you want people to like you and...

49:57.870 --> 49:58.910
Do know what I mean?

49:59.872 --> 50:00.872
You want to...

50:02.249 --> 50:04.379
All kinds of reasons to lie.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.211
I thought of a way of not lying,

50:07.296 --> 50:09.546
and I'll...
I'll share it with you, if you like?

50:10.341 --> 50:13.931
You can tell the truth, word for word,

50:14.011 --> 50:16.511
absolutely true, but when you do it...

50:17.698 --> 50:20.598
You use a sarcastic accent.

50:23.312 --> 50:24.612
So I'll give you an example.

50:24.688 --> 50:28.648
Your wife goes, "Hey, I noticed at dinner
you were looking at my sister."

50:28.734 --> 50:31.904
You're... You're not attracted
to my sister, are you?"

50:31.987 --> 50:33.197
And then you go,

50:33.280 --> 50:35.990
"Oh, yes, I forgot to tell you,

50:36.075 --> 50:38.325
I'm attracted to your sister."

50:41.830 --> 50:44.250
She's like,
"All right, Henry. Never mind."

50:46.335 --> 50:49.915
You go, "No. Why? It's true.
I want to fuck her. I..."

50:51.840 --> 50:55.680
"Hey, the only reason I married you
is to fuck your sister, right?"

50:57.012 --> 50:59.392
She's like,
"No, I shouldn't have brought it up."

50:59.473 --> 51:02.273
"No! Why wouldn't you bring it up?

51:02.351 --> 51:04.601
I mean,
you're the victim in this whole thing."

51:06.230 --> 51:10.650
"I remember at the vows, I kept thinking,"

51:10.734 --> 51:13.954
I am going to seduce

51:14.029 --> 51:18.029
"every member of my wife's family."

51:19.201 --> 51:20.911
"Regardless of gender,

51:20.995 --> 51:22.995
I'm going to fuck all of them."

51:23.956 --> 51:25.326
"Then, afterwards,"

51:25.416 --> 51:27.536
I'm going to invite them over to the house

51:27.626 --> 51:30.416
"and set it on fire, killing them all."

51:33.716 --> 51:37.216
"And then I'm going to move on
to the next town, where I do it again."

51:38.512 --> 51:41.772
It's like, "All right, Henry.
We don't need to hear it."

51:43.017 --> 51:44.887
"You don't have to be like this."

51:46.103 --> 51:47.563
"Why? Why?"

51:53.902 --> 51:56.862
"You're the good person in this scenario."

51:58.991 --> 52:03.161
"I'm the guy
that goes from town to town..."

52:04.371 --> 52:07.421
fucking and murdering entire families...

52:08.751 --> 52:13.671
"And leaving conflagrations of ashes
that used to be human beings."

52:16.717 --> 52:20.677
"I'm the most savage"

52:20.763 --> 52:24.393
and prolific serial killer
that ever was...

52:25.392 --> 52:27.442
and I've just never been found out yet,

52:27.519 --> 52:28.599
"that's all."

52:31.106 --> 52:33.106
"Just go to sleep."

52:34.860 --> 52:36.240
"Yeah, I'll go to sleep,

52:36.320 --> 52:39.030
or maybe I'll buy kerosene all night."

52:44.953 --> 52:46.463
So, that's just an example.

52:46.538 --> 52:48.078
You don't have to do that one.

52:50.209 --> 52:51.209
I'm just...

52:51.794 --> 52:53.214
I'm just saying, that's all.

52:54.838 --> 52:57.338
But, listen, there's important things
going on in the world,

52:57.424 --> 52:58.974
it's raining in the forest.

53:01.762 --> 53:03.812
I don't want to get
too political with you,

53:03.889 --> 53:06.019
but it's a true fact.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.397
Now, I know...

53:12.481 --> 53:15.651
You know, I know uh... science,

53:15.734 --> 53:21.164
and I would not be surprised at all if,
like, ten years from now, scientists went,

53:21.240 --> 53:24.870
"Goddamn! It's good we burned down
that motherfucking rainforest."

53:26.912 --> 53:30.372
"It turned out that's where all
the spiders and snakes lived and shit."

53:33.419 --> 53:36.799
"It's what started that snake flu
that nearly took everybody out."

53:39.967 --> 53:41.637
Nobody knows nothing.

53:47.391 --> 53:49.941
But, you know,
you're supposed to crunch up cans,

53:50.018 --> 53:52.018
and I think it's a good thing, you know?

53:52.771 --> 53:55.481
You've got the orange
and then the green, there's blue.

53:55.566 --> 53:58.856
You crunch the cans, and then you
put that... And you should do that.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.574
I'm not doing it, but you guys...

54:02.698 --> 54:05.578
Should do it,
because it's important, you know?

54:06.076 --> 54:08.906
It's always supposed to be
for the people from the future.

54:08.996 --> 54:11.036
That's how they try to trick you,
you know?

54:11.123 --> 54:14.043
They always go,
"The children are the future,"

54:14.126 --> 54:18.006
which is true,
but they said that when I was a child.

54:19.423 --> 54:22.794
Then I grew up. I was like, "Here I am!"
They were like, "Now it's the other kids."

54:22.818 --> 54:24.138
I go, "You fucker."

54:25.337 --> 54:27.627
"I had a feeling
there was something here."

54:29.725 --> 54:32.305
"I know a Ponzi scheme when I see one."

54:37.065 --> 54:39.025
"And now it's the other children."

54:39.109 --> 54:41.109
[cheering and applause.

54:47.576 --> 54:50.246
Listen, this has all been wonderful.

54:51.413 --> 54:52.833
But I will tell you this.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.170
Nothing I have said, really,
is of substance.

54:56.251 --> 54:57.461
I-I find...

55:00.506 --> 55:02.086
And it's not just me.

55:02.174 --> 55:03.184
I find...

55:03.884 --> 55:07.054
Like, most of my act is just,

55:07.137 --> 55:08.137
you know...

55:08.222 --> 55:09.222
uh...

55:09.306 --> 55:11.846
gossip and... and trickery.

55:13.644 --> 55:16.614
Do you know what I mean?
Like some cheap magician, you know?

55:19.566 --> 55:22.026
So, I'll tell you the only thing
I know for a fact,

55:22.110 --> 55:23.860
and it's something that we all know.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.316
Everybody knows it,

55:25.405 --> 55:27.945
but it's harder to act on it, it is.

55:28.033 --> 55:31.703
But the only really true thing

55:31.787 --> 55:33.407
is that...

55:33.956 --> 55:38.126
we all must love each other.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.715
And it's very difficult, you know?

55:43.799 --> 55:45.429
It's very, very hard.

55:46.593 --> 55:47.803
Hey, what about this?

55:47.886 --> 55:49.846
A dog loves people.

55:49.930 --> 55:53.560
Like, you think it's hard to love people -
a dog loves everybody.

55:53.642 --> 55:54.982
Like, a dog...

55:55.852 --> 55:58.062
Like, my dog, right,

55:58.146 --> 55:59.476
I've never seen such a...

55:59.565 --> 56:00.565
No judgement.

56:00.649 --> 56:02.779
Like, my dog, all he does is love me.

56:02.859 --> 56:03.859
When I wake up...

56:03.944 --> 56:05.454
I think he watches me sleeping,

56:05.529 --> 56:07.529
because when I wake up, he's right there,

56:07.614 --> 56:08.994
and he's like, "I love you!"

56:09.074 --> 56:11.244
He jumps up. He's licking my face.

56:11.326 --> 56:13.996
"I love you more than anything!
You're the greatest!"

56:14.079 --> 56:16.619
I go, "Thanks.
You're cool, too. I love you."

56:16.707 --> 56:19.167
"I love you more than anything!"
"I love you, too."

56:19.251 --> 56:21.171
"Remember yesterday
when you threw that bone

56:21.253 --> 56:22.813
and it turned out to be a rubber bone?"

56:22.838 --> 56:25.668
"Yeah, it was a joke.
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings."

56:25.757 --> 56:28.677
"I wasn't! I wasn't!
I was laughing. It was funny."

56:29.261 --> 56:31.891
"Oh, you love me so much, and I love you."

56:31.972 --> 56:33.352
This is the greatest thing.

56:33.432 --> 56:35.772
"I'm just going to kiss you
and kiss you forever."

56:35.851 --> 56:38.561
I go, "Yes, you can do that."
"I'm just going to keep kissing you."

56:38.645 --> 56:40.855
Then I go, "OK,
get the fuck away from me, all right?!"

56:42.316 --> 56:43.936
"Just leave me alone, would you?"

56:46.278 --> 56:49.408
"I've got to write shit
into a magic phone and stuff."

56:49.489 --> 56:51.199
I've got no time for this...

56:51.825 --> 56:53.615
"fucking dog stuff."

56:57.247 --> 56:58.957
Then my dog goes, "You're right."

57:02.919 --> 57:04.499
"I find... You know, I love you,

57:04.588 --> 57:07.758
but I... I just push too hard."

57:10.177 --> 57:12.007
"I push and I push and I push,

57:12.095 --> 57:13.595
and I push you away."

57:16.642 --> 57:17.982
"I'm no good."

57:18.727 --> 57:20.517
"I'm no damn good."

57:26.234 --> 57:27.324
"But what say..."

57:28.195 --> 57:31.155
what say I just stood here

57:31.239 --> 57:32.659
and stared at you...

57:35.577 --> 57:37.157
Completely quietly...

57:38.038 --> 57:40.458
until, finally, you looked at me again...

57:41.166 --> 57:42.246
with some look of love,

57:42.334 --> 57:44.254
"and then I jump up and love you again?"

57:46.505 --> 57:49.005
And you go, "Yes, that would be fine."

57:50.217 --> 57:51.297
"Do that."

57:56.348 --> 57:57.848
They don't judge, dogs.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.943
We judge, you know?
All our love comes with caveats, you know?

58:02.020 --> 58:05.980
There's no such thing
as unconditional love with human beings.

58:06.066 --> 58:08.106
But dogs, they don't care.

58:08.193 --> 58:09.193
They love...

58:09.277 --> 58:11.237
Hitler had a dog. Now, you think of that.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.367
I'm no fan of Hitler.

58:17.035 --> 58:18.075
I never liked him.

58:19.663 --> 58:23.633
I didn't like him
before it was cool not to like him.

58:26.878 --> 58:31.678
But there was a dog in history
who loved Hitler more than anyone.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.588
He would wake up in the morning and go,

58:33.677 --> 58:34.757
"Where's Hitler?!"

58:34.845 --> 58:35.845
You know?

58:37.222 --> 58:39.272
And Göring, or somebody, would go,

58:39.349 --> 58:41.639
"He's not here.
He's doing some evil stuff."

58:43.145 --> 58:46.015
"I've explained to you, he spends
most of his time doing evil stuff.

58:46.106 --> 58:47.686
You can't see him that often."

58:47.774 --> 58:49.154
He goes, "OK. Yeah, I know."

58:49.234 --> 58:52.704
I'm not trying to...
Listen, Göring, I love you, you know?

58:52.779 --> 58:56.279
I love Mengele, I love everybody.
All you guys are the greatest.

58:56.366 --> 59:00.616
"But it's just Hitler
is the greatest man who's ever lived."

59:10.464 --> 59:14.384
This is why we ask
that you don't use recording devices.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.520
Just...

59:26.605 --> 59:30.315
I don't want to be with fucking
Harvey Levin tomorrow or something.

59:32.986 --> 59:36.656
"Did you say Hitler was the greatest?"
And what would be my fucking answer?

59:36.740 --> 59:38.580
I would go, "No, it was a dog."

59:41.161 --> 59:43.161
That wouldn't work. I would be fucked.

59:48.001 --> 59:49.001
But...

59:49.503 --> 59:54.173
I'll be goddamned if I'm going
to end a special talking about Hitler.

59:58.929 --> 01:00:00.969
Yeah, that's what I'm going to do -

01:00:01.056 --> 01:00:02.386
end a special...

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:07.147
I'm going to call my special <i>Hitler's Dog.</i>

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:14.316
