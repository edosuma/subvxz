00:01.737 --> 00:03.908
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ On the menu tonight, lamb.

00:03.908 --> 00:05.077
( gasping )

00:05.077 --> 00:07.448
<i>...the top 17</i>
<i>had front row seats</i>

00:07.448 --> 00:09.820
<i>to a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>master class.</i>

00:09.820 --> 00:11.456
Gordon:
You've got to speed up.

00:11.456 --> 00:12.859
‐ <i>Yachecia...</i>
‐ Textbook.

00:12.859 --> 00:15.030
‐ <i>and Cate...</i>
‐ It's incredibly impressive.

00:15.030 --> 00:18.103
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ <i>were a cut above the rest,</i>

00:18.103 --> 00:20.508
<i>but Sam didn't have</i>
<i>the chops...</i>

00:20.508 --> 00:21.777
I wouldn't even
( bleep ) swallow that.

00:21.777 --> 00:22.712
I can't do that
to my palate.

00:22.712 --> 00:25.552
<i>to stay in the competition.</i>

00:29.726 --> 00:31.830
<i>‐ Tonight...</i>
‐ Service!

00:31.830 --> 00:34.736
<i>The home cooks run a five‐star</i>
<i>restaurant service.</i>

00:34.736 --> 00:38.310
‐ Two Benny, one pancake.
‐ <i>But will this high‐end</i>
<i>breakfast challenge...</i>

00:38.310 --> 00:39.580
You're burning your eggs.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.584
<i>...leave one team scrambled?</i>

00:41.584 --> 00:42.686
Where's my two and two?

00:42.686 --> 00:44.523
If it's not up, it's done.

00:44.523 --> 00:45.925
My pancakes are up there
and they're dying.

00:45.925 --> 00:47.929
We need
to get this together.

00:47.929 --> 00:50.668
A five‐star hotel
and we serve them that?

00:50.668 --> 00:52.438
Oh, my God.

01:01.356 --> 01:02.892
Whoo!

01:02.892 --> 01:04.529
‐ All right, all right.
‐ Wow.

01:04.529 --> 01:07.502
The Peninsula Hotel
is like a dream.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.374
This is very posh.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.746
Eboni:
<i>It looks like it's been</i>
<i>cut out of a movie.</i>

01:12.746 --> 01:15.217
<i>You talking about smelling</i>
<i>and feeling money?</i>

01:15.217 --> 01:18.557
Everywhere you look,
it's there.

01:21.362 --> 01:23.567
‐ Good morning. all of you.
‐ Good morning.

01:23.567 --> 01:26.239
‐ Line up. Wow.
‐ So fancy.

01:28.944 --> 01:30.414
Welcome to Beverly Hills,

01:30.414 --> 01:32.418
specifically,
The Belvedere Restaurant

01:32.418 --> 01:34.422
at the iconic
Peninsula Hotel.

01:34.422 --> 01:38.296
This legendary five‐star hotel
happens to be home

01:38.296 --> 01:40.935
to one of the finest
restaurants in the country,

01:40.935 --> 01:44.241
a restaurant that today
is being taken over

01:44.241 --> 01:45.912
by all of you home cooks.

01:45.912 --> 01:49.920
‐ ( cheers and applause )
‐ All right.

01:49.920 --> 01:52.091
Today you will be in charge of
a dining room breakfast service

01:52.091 --> 01:56.633
for this hotel's extremely
discerning guests.

01:56.633 --> 01:59.071
Now, we need two teams.

01:59.071 --> 02:02.411
Cate and Yachecia,
you two performed the best

02:02.411 --> 02:04.215
during the previous
lamb challenge,

02:04.215 --> 02:06.687
and today, you will each
captain a team.

02:06.687 --> 02:08.891
Come up and pick up
your aprons.

02:08.891 --> 02:11.897
Cate: <i>I'm not</i>
<i>a very aggressive person,</i>

02:11.897 --> 02:14.401
<i>I don't like telling people</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

02:14.401 --> 02:15.738
<i>It's not part of my nature.</i>

02:15.738 --> 02:17.742
I don't know how
this is gonna go.

02:17.742 --> 02:20.280
‐ So, Cate, quick question.
‐ Yes?

02:20.280 --> 02:24.054
Name one person that you
wouldn't want on your team.

02:24.054 --> 02:27.996
‐ Oh, I'm gonna go with Jeff.
‐ Interesting.

02:27.996 --> 02:32.271
Jeff has a very loud voice,
but he doesn't take direction.

02:32.271 --> 02:34.943
He kinda just likes to be
a little arrogant,

02:34.943 --> 02:37.447
and that's a quality
I don't need on my team.

02:37.447 --> 02:38.784
‐ Yachecia?
‐ Yes, sir?

02:38.784 --> 02:40.521
One person that you wouldn't
want on your team.

02:40.521 --> 02:44.763
‐ Today it would be Jennifer.
‐ Wow.

02:44.763 --> 02:45.965
Yachecia: <i>I don't want</i>
<i>Jennifer on my team</i>

02:45.965 --> 02:47.836
<i>because Jennifer cracks</i>
<i>under pressure,</i>

02:47.836 --> 02:50.140
and she's not refined enough
for this type of challenge.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.679
Today, the team captains

02:52.679 --> 02:55.483
are not in control
of which teams you get.

02:55.483 --> 02:57.889
That's gonna be in the hands
of all of you

02:57.889 --> 03:00.060
remaining home cooks.

03:00.060 --> 03:03.066
You want to work with Cate,
stand single file
right next to Cate.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.571
If you want to be
on Yachecia's team,
stay where you are.

03:05.571 --> 03:08.577
‐ Is everyone ready?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

03:08.577 --> 03:10.514
Go.

03:10.514 --> 03:11.917
Jennifer:
<i>Yachecia said she doesn't</i>
<i>want me on her team,</i>

03:11.917 --> 03:13.152
<i>but I want</i>
<i>to prove her wrong.</i>

03:13.152 --> 03:15.925
<i>She has this pre‐notion</i>
<i>that I'm dumb</i>

03:15.925 --> 03:18.363
<i>or that I don't have</i>
<i>enough talent as others.</i>

03:18.363 --> 03:20.868
But I'm in this game
and I'm growing every day

03:20.868 --> 03:22.204
and I'm learning every day.

03:22.204 --> 03:24.709
Captains, you'll need these.

03:24.709 --> 03:26.546
Please hand them out
to your teams.

03:26.546 --> 03:27.715
Yachecia:
<i>Looking at my team,</i>

03:27.715 --> 03:29.519
<i>I think I have</i>
<i>the underdog team.</i>

03:29.519 --> 03:33.026
<i>I am 100% used to being</i>
<i>the underdog.</i>

03:33.026 --> 03:35.030
So I know that we
can work together

03:35.030 --> 03:36.566
and I can lead this team
to victory.

03:36.566 --> 03:40.240
Today you will be cooking
five stunning breakfast dishes,

03:40.240 --> 03:43.681
and all made to order.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.584
There's just one more piece
of information

03:45.584 --> 03:49.058
that all of you need,
and that is the menu.

03:49.058 --> 03:50.861
Go change
into your chef whites

03:50.861 --> 03:52.565
and we will meet you all
in the kitchen.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.003
‐ Yes, Chef!
‐ ( applause )

03:55.003 --> 03:58.242
‐ Whoo‐hoo.
‐ Let's go! Red Team!

04:00.480 --> 04:03.453
Home cooks,
allow me to introduce you

04:03.453 --> 04:05.023
to executive chef
David Codney.

04:05.023 --> 04:08.731
‐ Good morning, Chef.
‐ Welcome, welcome, welcome.

04:08.731 --> 04:11.570
Now, we're gonna very quickly,
concisely, go over the menu.

04:11.570 --> 04:12.872
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ All right.

04:12.872 --> 04:16.813
First dish...
lemon ricotta pancakes.

04:16.813 --> 04:19.586
We have a little bit
of ricotta cheese on top
that we've whipped.

04:19.586 --> 04:21.155
We have a preserved
lemon butter.

04:21.155 --> 04:23.026
All right, next dish.

04:23.026 --> 04:27.067
David:
Classic eggs Benedict garnished
with some house chives.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.403
‐ They look incredible.
‐ Thank you.

04:28.403 --> 04:31.843
‐ The next breakfast dish...
‐ Wow.

04:31.843 --> 04:32.912
David:
My personal favorite.

04:32.912 --> 04:35.216
This is the potato waffle
and lobster.

04:35.216 --> 04:36.586
You want to under‐poach
the lobster just a hint,

04:36.586 --> 04:38.957
so when you heat it up,
it doesn't become rubbery.

04:38.957 --> 04:40.293
And the next dish.

04:40.293 --> 04:42.598
David:
Classic American breakfast.

04:42.598 --> 04:45.638
Two fried eggs, bacon,
house hash browns.

04:45.638 --> 04:48.577
‐ Wow.
‐ The final one, David, is...

04:48.577 --> 04:50.246
David:
Three egg omelette

04:50.246 --> 04:52.417
folded in with a little bit
of garnish and a hash brown.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.720
‐ Cooked to order?
‐ Cooked to order.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.457
Love it.

04:55.457 --> 04:57.929
This is serious
business, guys.

04:57.929 --> 05:00.467
‐ Is everyone ready?
‐ Yes, Chef.

05:00.467 --> 05:06.345
Your 60 minutes
of prep time starts...

05:06.345 --> 05:08.584
‐ now.
‐ Let's go, guys.

05:08.584 --> 05:10.721
‐ Line up, team. Let's go!
‐ Come on, Red Team!

05:10.721 --> 05:13.192
‐ Let's go, let's go.
‐ All right, so, Jeff,

05:13.192 --> 05:15.230
I need you
right on that hollandaise.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.267
Beautiful,
perfect every time.

05:17.267 --> 05:20.541
‐ And, Reba, eggs.
Jennifer, sunny‐side.
‐ Okay.

05:20.541 --> 05:22.410
‐ Caitlin, pancakes.
‐ You got it.

05:22.410 --> 05:24.381
‐ Jason, lobster.
Make it beautiful.
‐ Lobster.

05:24.381 --> 05:26.152
Dino,
I need that bacon perfect.

05:26.152 --> 05:28.422
‐ Jenny, poached eggs.
‐ I can do the poached eggs.

05:28.422 --> 05:30.594
Bring that in.
One, two, three, Blue Team.

05:30.594 --> 05:33.600
‐ Blue Team!
‐ Whoo!

05:33.600 --> 05:37.775
Okay, eggs Benedict.
I want Necco and Gabe
on the hollandaise.

05:37.775 --> 05:40.681
Eboni,
you're going to be doing
the poaching of the eggs.

05:40.681 --> 05:43.352
I want Newton
on the Canadian bacon
and the bacon.

05:43.352 --> 05:45.290
Boston boys,
Adam and Daniel,

05:45.290 --> 05:47.327
on the potato waffle
with the lobster.

05:47.327 --> 05:48.964
We have
lemon ricotta pancakes.

05:48.964 --> 05:52.103
We'll get those done
at the end.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.439
Eboni: <i>I don't agree</i>
<i>with the direction</i>

05:53.439 --> 05:54.642
the captain
is taking our team.

05:54.642 --> 05:56.212
She's got me poaching eggs.

05:56.212 --> 05:58.182
<i>I could probably do two</i>
<i>of these dishes by myself,</i>

05:58.182 --> 06:01.790
<i>and she's not utilizing anybody</i>
<i>to the best of their ability.</i>

06:01.790 --> 06:03.492
‐ All right.
‐ Let's go, let's go!
Go, Red Team!

06:03.492 --> 06:05.230
Find your station.
Get your knives.

06:05.230 --> 06:08.469
Now, come on, guys,
this is a tall order.

06:08.469 --> 06:11.342
I mean,
it takes weeks of training,
shadowing other cooks

06:11.342 --> 06:14.682
before I even put any one
of my cooks on the line.

06:14.682 --> 06:16.519
Now, Red Team
captained by Cate.

06:16.519 --> 06:18.991
Aarón:
Cate has very strong
personalities on her team.

06:18.991 --> 06:21.095
She has Daniel
and she has Eboni.

06:21.095 --> 06:23.266
Both have a lot of gravitas,

06:23.266 --> 06:24.702
but my concern
with the Red Team

06:24.702 --> 06:25.704
is gonna be
not enough soldiers,

06:25.704 --> 06:27.040
‐ Yeah?
‐ too many leaders.

06:27.040 --> 06:29.612
‐ Here's‐‐ I got my‐‐
‐ Lemons out of the way.

06:29.612 --> 06:30.848
If we don't need
the freaking lemons,
get them out of the way.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.652
Who's using this water?
You using this?

06:32.652 --> 06:33.787
‐ Yes, I'm using that.
‐ Okay.

06:33.787 --> 06:35.290
I think the Blue Team
has got a big advantage.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.860
They have age on their side
and experience.

06:36.860 --> 06:39.565
Get it prepped,
that way we have it ready.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.836
Gordon:
They may not look
the most dynamic,

06:41.836 --> 06:44.408
but I think you've got
the stronger cooks
in the blue this morning.

06:44.408 --> 06:46.746
‐ Don't let me down.
Y'all got this.
‐ Less talk, Jeff.

06:51.255 --> 06:53.894
When you think about a place
like The Belvedere
at the Peninsula,

06:53.894 --> 06:57.233
you expect top‐notch service,
an amazing dining experience,

06:57.233 --> 06:59.739
and I have the same
expectations today.

06:59.739 --> 07:03.513
The Peninsula Hotel is really
one of my most favorite hotels.

07:03.513 --> 07:06.653
<i>Although I live in Los Angeles,</i>
<i>we love to come here.</i>

07:06.653 --> 07:08.022
<i>The food is so outstanding.</i>

07:08.022 --> 07:09.892
And I'm really
looking forward

07:09.892 --> 07:11.863
to seeing what these chefs
are gonna do today.

07:14.969 --> 07:17.374
Chef, the first two
blue tickets are in.

07:17.374 --> 07:19.812
Thank you.
Okay, Blue Team, order on.

07:19.812 --> 07:21.649
First table, one omelette,
one pancake,

07:21.649 --> 07:23.854
followed by two Benedict,
one American breakfast,
one pancake.

07:23.854 --> 07:25.758
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ How long, please, Yachecia?

07:25.758 --> 07:29.164
‐ Four minutes, Chef.
‐ Thank you. Good girl.

07:29.164 --> 07:31.569
All right, guys,
we got this.

07:31.569 --> 07:33.507
Red Team, we are live.
Let's go.

07:33.507 --> 07:34.609
Four covers, table 52.

07:34.609 --> 07:36.846
One lobster, one American,
two omelettes.

07:36.846 --> 07:39.719
Give me a time, please.

07:39.719 --> 07:42.123
‐ Six minutes, Chef.
‐ Drive your team. Let's go!

07:42.123 --> 07:43.960
Cate:
<i>I'm kind of freaking out</i>
<i>right now.</i>

07:43.960 --> 07:46.633
<i>There's so many things</i>
<i>going through my head,</i>

07:46.633 --> 07:50.039
and it's very frustrating to
try to organize chaos.

07:50.039 --> 07:53.814
I need, um, we need, uh,

07:53.814 --> 07:57.621
for here,
we need the tomato‐‐
no, I'm sorry.

07:57.621 --> 08:01.094
‐ One‐‐ one Benedict.
I have one Benedict.
‐ All together?

08:01.094 --> 08:03.834
Cate:
<i>The pressure is just</i>
<i>so unreal.</i>

08:03.834 --> 08:05.671
<i>I'm just like,</i>
<i>"Can I do this?"</i>

08:05.671 --> 08:07.173
I don't know.

08:07.173 --> 08:10.346
Let's go, guys.
Waffles in, pancakes on.

08:10.346 --> 08:12.283
Cate! Turn the gas on!

08:12.283 --> 08:14.287
You're standing there cooking
and there's not even gas on!

08:14.287 --> 08:16.358
Take a deep breath.
You got this.

08:16.358 --> 08:17.895
Oh, dear.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.303
One omelette, one pancake.

08:22.303 --> 08:24.140
Good. Lovely pancakes.
Nice and crisp.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.378
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Service, please. Pick up.

08:26.378 --> 08:29.719
‐ Blue Team, all day.
Two Benny, heard?
‐ Heard.

08:29.719 --> 08:31.723
Three American breakfasts.
Heard?

08:31.723 --> 08:33.292
‐ Yes!
‐ Let's go.

08:33.292 --> 08:35.964
This Blue Team is stellar.

08:35.964 --> 08:38.402
‐ We good over here?
‐ We're good over here.

08:38.402 --> 08:40.574
Yachecia:
I need two beautiful
pieces of bacon.

08:40.574 --> 08:42.678
<i>We are on point,</i>
<i>we are focused,</i>

08:42.678 --> 08:45.784
we are sending tables out
one after one after one.

08:45.784 --> 08:47.688
Two Benny, one pancake.

08:47.688 --> 08:49.291
Two beautiful eggs Benedict.

08:49.291 --> 08:51.529
<i>If the Blue Team keeps</i>
<i>putting out plates like this,</i>

08:51.529 --> 08:53.667
we are gonna demolish
the Red Team.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.436
Lobster, eggs Benny, up!

08:57.875 --> 09:00.379
‐ Red Team?
‐ Yes, Chef?

09:00.379 --> 09:03.485
In 25 minutes,
we've served one table of two,

09:03.485 --> 09:06.993
and I'm waiting on one lobster,
one breakfast, two omelettes.

09:06.993 --> 09:10.066
‐ I have one omelette here.
‐ Oh, my God.

09:10.066 --> 09:11.836
Eboni:
<i>Everybody's timing is off.</i>

09:11.836 --> 09:14.274
There's no communication.
There's no leadership.

09:14.274 --> 09:15.611
Where's the teamwork?

09:15.611 --> 09:18.415
I got a lobster waffle.
Let's go!

09:18.415 --> 09:20.787
<i>Cate's just barking out</i>
<i>these orders,</i>

09:20.787 --> 09:22.290
but nobody knows
where they're going.

09:22.290 --> 09:24.027
‐ Adam?
‐ Yes, Chef?

09:24.027 --> 09:26.933
The lobster, it's raw.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.839
Adam's sending out raw lobster.
Some food is getting cold.

09:29.839 --> 09:31.843
My pancakes are up there
and they're dying.

09:31.843 --> 09:33.546
Eboni:
Come on, Necco, let's go!

09:33.546 --> 09:35.684
This is a disaster.

09:35.684 --> 09:37.788
‐ All right, young lady?
‐ Yes, Chef?

09:37.788 --> 09:40.727
‐ Look at the omelette.
‐ Eboni: Oh, my God.

09:40.727 --> 09:43.867
I've seen a diaper look more
appetizing than that ( bleep ).

09:43.867 --> 09:46.706
I'm sorry.
It's ridiculous.

09:46.706 --> 09:50.179
Guys, we need
to get this together!

09:58.763 --> 10:01.401
Gordon:
Cate, I've got one omelette.
Where's the other one?

10:01.401 --> 10:04.207
I'm getting it.
I'm getting it.

10:04.207 --> 10:06.612
Red Team, stop.
All of you.

10:06.612 --> 10:09.050
Come here!

10:09.050 --> 10:13.058
Fifth time. One lobster,
one American breakfast,
two omelette.

10:13.058 --> 10:16.231
Here's what I get‐‐
one omelette, cooked by Cate.

10:16.231 --> 10:19.572
On the same freaking ticket,
we got two omelettes.

10:19.572 --> 10:22.578
And now she goes back
to start this omelette.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.617
If you can't cook
two omelettes side by side,

10:25.617 --> 10:27.621
untie your apron
and give it to me now

10:27.621 --> 10:30.426
because this is a joke.

10:30.426 --> 10:32.731
Now, I'm not asking,
I'm telling you.

10:32.731 --> 10:33.767
Change your captain,

10:33.767 --> 10:36.138
get a meeting,
get a strategy,

10:36.138 --> 10:40.747
and come back to me
with a pair of bollocks,
one of you.

10:40.747 --> 10:43.620
Eboni:
<i>We're going down if we stay</i>
<i>under Cate's direction.</i>

10:43.620 --> 10:46.124
She can't handle the pressure.
She can't lead.

10:46.124 --> 10:47.928
<i>It's time for me</i>
<i>to get in mommy mode</i>

10:47.928 --> 10:50.266
<i>and train this team</i>
<i>like I would my kids.</i>

10:50.266 --> 10:51.602
Watch this.

10:51.602 --> 10:53.606
Necco, stay over there
on waffles.

10:53.606 --> 10:54.775
Adam, we could use you
on the grill.

10:54.775 --> 10:56.178
You could produce
a better pancake.

10:56.178 --> 10:58.650
Y'all go back on eggs Benedict
and we gonna clean up

10:58.650 --> 10:59.985
and substitute everywhere.

10:59.985 --> 11:01.254
I'm staying on omelettes.

11:01.254 --> 11:04.060
‐ Who is in charge, please?
‐ Chefs: Eboni, Chef!

11:04.060 --> 11:05.597
‐ Thank you.
‐ Eboni: We focused!

11:05.597 --> 11:08.603
Come on, come on, come on.
We got this.

11:11.241 --> 11:14.247
Pancake, Benedict,
beautifully done,
going stone cold.

11:14.247 --> 11:16.251
Jennifer,
where are my eggs?

11:16.251 --> 11:18.590
‐ Reba:
You're burning your eggs.
‐ I'm sorry, Chef.

11:18.590 --> 11:19.859
I'm getting it together.

11:19.859 --> 11:22.363
I got three tables
waiting on you, Jennifer.

11:22.363 --> 11:25.269
I need you on point, girl.

11:25.269 --> 11:28.877
I knew this was gonna happen.
I knew Jennifer was going
to crack under pressure.

11:28.877 --> 11:32.316
Jennifer, are you putting
any butter in this pan?

11:32.316 --> 11:34.521
‐ Yes, I put oil at the bottom.
‐ This egg ain't moving.

11:34.521 --> 11:36.391
‐ I got these then.
‐ All right.

11:36.391 --> 11:38.028
‐ They're not perfect.
‐ Wow.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.999
These eggs are not done.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.736
I need the American breakfast.

11:41.736 --> 11:44.508
‐ Two minutes.
‐ Two minutes? Take that back.

11:44.508 --> 11:46.011
‐ You killed the whole table.
‐ Take that back.

11:46.011 --> 11:48.315
I'm sorry, guys.

11:48.315 --> 11:50.185
Yachecia:
<i>This is a total disaster.</i>

11:50.185 --> 11:51.722
Jennifer keeps saying
she can do this,

11:51.722 --> 11:54.060
<i>and she keeps sending out</i>
<i>bad eggs.</i>

11:54.060 --> 11:56.766
I don't have time
to babysit in the kitchen.

11:56.766 --> 12:00.105
Okay, stop.
Blue Team, switch.

12:00.105 --> 12:02.143
‐ Jennifer, back up Jenny.
‐ Okay, whatever.

12:02.143 --> 12:05.517
Jeff, I need you
here with Chef.
I'm on eggs.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.186
If I don't jump on this line,
we're going down.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.656
I got it, I got it.

12:11.562 --> 12:13.533
How long
on the lobster waffles?

12:13.533 --> 12:16.071
‐ 20 seconds.
‐ How long on pancakes?

12:16.071 --> 12:19.878
‐ 45 seconds on pancakes.
‐ Good job. Service!

12:19.878 --> 12:23.251
‐ Two of you, table 54,
one lobster waffle.
‐ Come on!

12:23.251 --> 12:27.059
The little girl from Chicago
with lungs big as Texas.

12:27.059 --> 12:29.898
‐ I need six pancakes
‐ Got pancakes coming up,
Eboni.

12:29.898 --> 12:32.537
‐ Good job!
Y'all doing a good job.
‐ Yes, Chef.

12:32.537 --> 12:34.073
That's a team leader
right there.

12:34.073 --> 12:35.877
When you two minutes out,
let him know

12:35.877 --> 12:37.781
‐ so his pancakes
can stay hot.
‐ Yes, Chef.

12:37.781 --> 12:39.050
‐ Let's get it.
‐ Got it, Chef.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.021
You guys,
your food's looking great.

12:41.021 --> 12:42.924
‐ Keep it up.
‐ All: Thanks, Chef!

12:42.924 --> 12:44.227
Newton:
<i>We got timing,</i>

12:44.227 --> 12:46.264
<i>we got communication,</i>
<i>we got teamwork,</i>

12:46.264 --> 12:48.268
and we're kicking ass
and taking names.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.076
You just got four tickets out
in the last two minutes.
Nice job.

12:52.076 --> 12:53.646
Good, let's go.
I need them eggs.

12:53.646 --> 12:56.652
Let's keep it flowing.
Let's keep the flow going.

12:59.424 --> 13:02.196
‐ Here we go.
‐ Hey, stop.

13:02.196 --> 13:06.906
‐ Blue Team.
‐ Oh, my God.

13:06.906 --> 13:08.943
‐ Come on.
‐ Okay.

13:08.943 --> 13:11.247
No, stop.
It's not okay.

13:11.247 --> 13:14.253
‐ You don't care.
‐ ( bleep ).

13:17.026 --> 13:18.629
So you think that's
good enough to send?

13:18.629 --> 13:20.600
Just so I know
where you are standard‐wise.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.804
I don't, actually,
and we're gonna get two more
orders to complete this order.

13:22.804 --> 13:25.810
Don't dare send me
your ( bleep ) again,

13:25.810 --> 13:27.113
'cause I look
a bigger dick than you.

13:27.113 --> 13:29.718
‐ I'm not a dick, for one.
‐ Three breakfasts?

13:29.718 --> 13:32.824
When you send me that
and then tell me
that that's your best‐‐

13:32.824 --> 13:34.728
That's not my best.
I never said it was my best.

13:34.728 --> 13:37.233
Did you hear what I said?
I look a bigger dick than you.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.470
And I'm not gonna send that.
Heard?

13:39.470 --> 13:43.980
‐ Heard.
‐ We can debate
about the dick bit later.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.451
Dino: <i>Are you kidding me?</i>
<i>You need to shut your mouth.</i>

13:46.451 --> 13:48.823
<i>You can't be yelling</i>
<i>at Chef Ramsay like that.</i>

13:48.823 --> 13:50.994
You need to show him
some respect.

13:50.994 --> 13:52.263
Gordon:
How long for the breakfasts?

13:52.263 --> 13:54.267
Or I'm starting
this table again.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.371
‐ Two minutes.
‐ <i>This is madness.</i>

13:56.371 --> 13:58.943
<i>We better wake</i>
<i>up, get in the game,</i>

13:58.943 --> 14:00.279
or it's curtains for us.

14:00.279 --> 14:03.118
Get it right, Yachecia.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.438
Yachecia,
where's the breakfast?

14:13.438 --> 14:15.777
‐ I need it now.
‐ Walking with American.

14:15.777 --> 14:17.614
‐ Finally.
‐ Here we go.

14:17.614 --> 14:20.920
Why are you doing this
to me?

14:20.920 --> 14:25.863
A five‐star hotel
and we're serving that?

14:25.863 --> 14:28.368
For the fourth time,
one breakfast, one omelette,

14:28.368 --> 14:29.938
followed by two breakfasts,
two omelettes.

14:29.938 --> 14:32.276
All: Yes, Chef.

14:32.276 --> 14:33.779
Jennifer:
<i>I'm pissed right now.</i>

14:33.779 --> 14:36.150
<i>Yachecia took me off eggs,</i>
<i>but now she goes to eggs,</i>

14:36.150 --> 14:37.687
she's not even able
to make an egg.

14:37.687 --> 14:41.127
Two American breakfasts,
two omelettes.
I'm dragging hard!

14:41.127 --> 14:43.031
<i>Customers are waiting.</i>

14:43.031 --> 14:45.202
If we don't get it together,
were not going to feed
these people.

14:45.202 --> 14:48.208
‐ We're gonna lose.
‐ We need to get 21 out now.

14:50.980 --> 14:53.151
Three eggs Benedict,
one pancake.

14:53.151 --> 14:55.022
Service!
Two servers.

14:55.022 --> 14:57.192
Eboni:
<i>As we're approaching</i>
<i>the end of service,</i>

14:57.192 --> 14:59.163
I'm kind of like
in mommy chef mode.

14:59.163 --> 15:01.267
<i>It's like these are all</i>
<i>my kids,</i>

15:01.267 --> 15:04.307
<i>watch 'em like a hawk,</i>
<i>make sure they do it right.</i>

15:04.307 --> 15:05.677
At the same time,
motivate and create.

15:05.677 --> 15:08.983
‐ I need one more omelette.
‐ Got it coming.

15:14.961 --> 15:16.832
So you guys have
the Blue Team's breakfast.

15:16.832 --> 15:18.368
‐ Yes.
‐ Okay, tell me
what do you think

15:18.368 --> 15:19.571
about your
eggs Benedict there?

15:19.571 --> 15:21.307
The hollandaise sauce
is fantastic.

15:21.307 --> 15:25.415
It's zesty.
The egg is poached
exactly correctly.

15:25.415 --> 15:27.152
‐ It's wonderful.
‐ That's awesome.

15:27.152 --> 15:28.756
How am I doing
on that eggs Benny?

15:28.756 --> 15:31.094
We're good.
We're almost there.

15:31.094 --> 15:33.933
I had the Red Team's
waffles with lobster.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.839
Very nice and buttery
and delicious.
Melts in my mouth.

15:36.839 --> 15:39.544
‐ Lobster up.
‐ Thank you, Adam.

15:39.544 --> 15:41.882
I had the Blue Team
all American breakfast.

15:41.882 --> 15:46.257
I am disappointed.
My eggs are really runny.
They look a little mucousy.

15:46.257 --> 15:49.363
I've been coming to
The Belvedere for years
and I was hoping for better.

15:49.363 --> 15:51.401
Come on, guys.
I got about five minutes left,

15:51.401 --> 15:54.240
but I still am dragging
on those eggs, please.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.612
The Red Team's omelette
was cooked awesome.

15:56.612 --> 15:57.814
I mean, like,
it's beautiful and fluffy,

15:57.814 --> 15:59.450
but the seasoning
was inconsistent.

15:59.450 --> 16:01.655
Whoo!

16:01.655 --> 16:04.226
My ricotta pancakes
are delicious.

16:04.226 --> 16:07.099
They're so light.
They're wonderful.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.571
Guys,
this is the very last ticket.

16:09.571 --> 16:10.740
Wrap it up as a team.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.075
We coming right now.

16:12.075 --> 16:13.879
Table 13, please.

16:13.879 --> 16:15.950
‐ That's it, no tickets.
‐ Red Team!

16:15.950 --> 16:17.453
Red Team, where we at?
Stand up.

16:17.453 --> 16:19.023
Nice job.
Be proud of your work today.

16:19.023 --> 16:21.962
We did it.
What you know? What you know?

16:21.962 --> 16:23.264
‐ Yeah!
‐ What you know?

16:23.264 --> 16:24.568
Eboni:
<i>I'm proud of our team.</i>

16:24.568 --> 16:26.738
We did have
a strong comeback,

16:26.738 --> 16:29.276
<i>but the fact that</i>
<i>it took us 25 minutes</i>

16:29.276 --> 16:32.216
<i>to get out</i>
<i>one correct plate almost,</i>

16:32.216 --> 16:33.953
it could be anybody's
game right now.

16:33.953 --> 16:37.292
Blue Team, yet again,

16:37.292 --> 16:40.967
I've got a plate
full of snot.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.906
Now for the fifth
and final time,

16:43.906 --> 16:47.112
I need two breakfasts
with two omelettes

16:47.112 --> 16:50.118
cooked with some respect.
Heard?

16:50.118 --> 16:51.320
Yes, Chef!

16:51.320 --> 16:53.626
Two minutes left of service.

16:53.626 --> 16:55.462
If it's not up,
it's done.

16:55.462 --> 16:57.132
Get it right.

16:57.132 --> 17:00.105
Jenny:
<i>We have had</i>
<i>the same two orders</i>

17:00.105 --> 17:02.577
for the last 45 minutes
it feels like.

17:02.577 --> 17:05.282
‐ 60 seconds remaining.
‐ Come on, guys.

17:05.282 --> 17:07.754
Yachecia, I'm dragging on
those two American breakfasts.

17:07.754 --> 17:09.791
<i>It's hitting the fan</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

17:09.791 --> 17:11.227
<i>Everybody's running around</i>

17:11.227 --> 17:12.396
like a chicken
with their head cut off.

17:12.396 --> 17:15.235
45 seconds to go.
Come on, guys, please.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.740
Where's my two and two?
Where's my two and two?

17:17.740 --> 17:21.347
‐ 20 seconds.
‐ <i>And now Yachecia</i>
<i>needs to be perfect,</i>

17:21.347 --> 17:24.119
or else we are going down
with these eggs.

17:24.119 --> 17:25.957
‐ Come on!
‐ Where's my eggs?

17:25.957 --> 17:26.959
Come on, guys,
we got this.

17:26.959 --> 17:28.596
Come on,
that's all we need.

17:28.596 --> 17:30.131
‐ Come on, Yachecia.
‐ Ten, nine,

17:30.131 --> 17:32.302
‐ Yachecia, give me them.
‐ eight, seven,

17:32.302 --> 17:34.674
‐ six, five, four,
‐ We got it, guys. Come on.

17:34.674 --> 17:37.780
‐ three, two, one.
‐ Oh, God.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.784
And stop!

17:39.784 --> 17:43.191
Service is over,
and I'm not serving
that ( bleep ).

17:45.730 --> 17:48.702
Blue Team, clear down.

17:50.673 --> 17:53.879
I feel horrible.

17:53.879 --> 17:57.085
<i>As a team captain,</i>
<i>I let my team down</i>

17:57.085 --> 18:00.993
<i>because I couldn't cook eggs.</i>

18:00.993 --> 18:04.133
How embarrassing.

18:04.133 --> 18:05.770
Red Team, Blue Team,

18:05.770 --> 18:07.372
you ran a world‐class

18:07.372 --> 18:09.544
restaurant's
breakfast service.

18:09.544 --> 18:12.517
There's not many home cooks
that can say they've done that.

18:12.517 --> 18:15.488
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

18:15.488 --> 18:18.796
Aarón was out there
fronting your service.

18:18.796 --> 18:22.169
Christina, myself,
and Aarón have dissected
the comment cards.

18:22.169 --> 18:27.012
We tasted your dishes,
we saw how you worked
together in the kitchen.

18:27.012 --> 18:30.385
So, without further ado,
today's best performing team...

18:32.557 --> 18:35.596
the team that will not face
the dreaded pressure test...

18:38.569 --> 18:41.575
is...

18:44.881 --> 18:49.758
‐ the Red Team.
‐ ( cheering )

18:49.758 --> 18:53.397
‐ Good job, guys.
‐ Eboni: <i>I'm so happy</i>
<i>my team won.</i>

18:53.397 --> 18:56.070
And I think this is intimidating
a few of my competitors.

18:56.070 --> 18:58.241
<i>Now they know</i>
<i>how strong I am,</i>

18:58.241 --> 19:00.278
<i>and I'm probably gonna be</i>
<i>a target now,</i>

19:00.278 --> 19:02.215
<i>which I was trying to be</i>
<i>sneaky with it.</i>

19:02.215 --> 19:04.219
But I did not want
to lose today,

19:04.219 --> 19:06.223
so I had to step up
and show my abilities.

19:06.223 --> 19:11.033
Eboni, we were impressed.
Vocal, assertive, disciplined.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.904
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Congratulations.

19:12.904 --> 19:16.277
All of you,
head out to the patio
and get yourselves a drink.

19:16.277 --> 19:17.680
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

19:17.680 --> 19:20.185
Blue Team,
I want you guys

19:20.185 --> 19:22.389
to start clearing down
both kitchens,

19:22.389 --> 19:24.761
and I'll see you back inside
the MasterChef kitchen.

19:24.761 --> 19:25.930
Let's go.

19:25.930 --> 19:28.034
‐ Nice job, guys. Nice job.
‐ Well done.

19:31.073 --> 19:35.248
Jeff:
<i>All of our asses</i>
<i>are on the line over eggs.</i>

19:35.248 --> 19:37.052
Jennifer:
<i>I'm filled with anger.</i>

19:37.052 --> 19:39.156
This is my life.
I want this.

19:39.156 --> 19:40.759
<i>Now I gotta go</i>
<i>on a pressure test?</i>

19:40.759 --> 19:43.765
I don't think that
this is fair to any of us.

19:43.765 --> 19:45.769
Jennifer: Yachecia,
I am upset with you.

19:45.769 --> 19:47.773
You should have kept me
on those eggs!

19:47.773 --> 19:49.476
You know how many eggs
we got sent back?

19:49.476 --> 19:51.080
Your eggs were sent back
the whole time!

19:51.080 --> 19:52.683
‐ Your eggs had
more sent back.
‐ The whole time!

19:52.683 --> 19:56.524
What you gonna do
is calm down.
That's what you gonna do.

19:56.524 --> 19:58.160
I think certain people
just don't know how to cook,

19:58.160 --> 20:00.431
and I think we're
gonna find out tomorrow

20:00.431 --> 20:01.868
who can cook and who can't.

20:20.973 --> 20:22.977
Come on down, please, guys.
Thank you.

20:22.977 --> 20:24.981
Yachecia:
<i>All eight of us are facing</i>
<i>elimination today,</i>

20:24.981 --> 20:27.152
and I feel like
it's all my fault.

20:27.152 --> 20:30.258
Line up, please.
Thank you very much.

20:30.258 --> 20:31.493
<i>We failed as a team,</i>
<i>however,</i>

20:31.493 --> 20:33.197
<i>I was the team captain.</i>

20:33.197 --> 20:35.703
<i>So I just have to be ready</i>
<i>to take my punishment</i>

20:35.703 --> 20:37.272
and face this pressure test.

20:37.272 --> 20:41.948
Unfortunately, Blue Team,
yesterday you struggled.

20:41.948 --> 20:46.290
So now it's back to every
home cook for themselves.

20:46.290 --> 20:48.862
Okay, what happened, Jeff?
Talk me through what you saw.

20:48.862 --> 20:51.901
‐ What went wrong?
‐ It all starts
from the top down.

20:51.901 --> 20:53.605
It was a terrible show
of leadership.

20:53.605 --> 20:55.876
A great leader
really needs to make sure

20:55.876 --> 20:57.479
that you can manage tasks
and motivate others.

20:57.479 --> 21:00.451
‐ ( chuckles )
‐ Yachecia, what's funny?

21:00.451 --> 21:02.322
I'm just amazed that someone

21:02.322 --> 21:05.829
who does not have
the ability to be led

21:05.829 --> 21:09.202
and is disrespectful
to any leader, even yourself‐‐

21:09.202 --> 21:11.608
Hey, where's your integrity?
You're the leader of this ship.

21:11.608 --> 21:13.077
We all go down with you,

21:13.077 --> 21:14.747
but instead
of being able to pull us,

21:14.747 --> 21:15.749
you need to push us.

21:15.749 --> 21:17.352
That's what leaders do.

21:17.352 --> 21:19.189
No, you need to speak to me
with respect.

21:19.189 --> 21:20.759
You don't deserve my respect
at this moment.

21:20.759 --> 21:23.632
Enough!
Come on, guys. Come on!

21:23.632 --> 21:26.771
‐ Quiet.
‐ And this is our team.

21:26.771 --> 21:31.380
Okay, Jennifer,
what happened?

21:31.380 --> 21:33.084
When I was on eggs,
we were ahead.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.654
She decided
to take me off eggs.

21:34.654 --> 21:36.591
She put me in the corner
with the waffles like a kid.

21:36.591 --> 21:38.227
And because she didn't
believe in me‐‐

21:38.227 --> 21:40.064
It wasn't about
not believing in you.

21:40.064 --> 21:43.070
If you believed in me,
you would have let me
take over the eggs.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.174
No, I wanted you to go
to waffles to calm down.

21:46.978 --> 21:49.817
Both teams had bumps.

21:49.817 --> 21:52.523
It's just that the Red Team
was smart enough, quick enough

21:52.523 --> 21:56.965
to reposition and play
each and every member
to their strengths.

21:56.965 --> 22:01.039
Christina:
Now, a team of eight
stands in front of us,

22:01.039 --> 22:04.246
but not all of you will compete
in this pressure test.

22:04.246 --> 22:09.222
What happens next
is entirely in
your captain's hands.

22:11.160 --> 22:14.399
Yachecia, you can choose
to save yourself,

22:14.399 --> 22:17.940
or six members of your team.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.478
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

22:20.478 --> 22:22.983
I would save myself
'cause I ain't none
of they friend.

22:22.983 --> 22:25.822
<i>This is "MasterChef."</i>
<i>There can only be one.</i>

22:25.822 --> 22:27.960
So she needs to take her ass
up to the balcony.

22:27.960 --> 22:33.037
Now, yourself,
or six individuals standing
alongside you?

22:35.174 --> 22:37.445
Be selfish.

22:37.445 --> 22:39.784
‐ Six.
‐ ( gasps )

22:39.784 --> 22:42.322
We failed.
The captain goes down
with the ship.

22:42.322 --> 22:43.725
I agree with that.
I agree with that.

22:43.725 --> 22:46.965
So the first name is who?

22:50.004 --> 22:52.977
Jason, Chef.
Good job.

22:52.977 --> 22:54.312
‐ Good job.
‐ Good job, Jason.

22:54.312 --> 22:56.416
Gordon:
Upstairs quickly, Jason.

22:56.416 --> 22:57.686
Man:
Get on up here.

22:57.686 --> 23:00.491
Yachecia, the second person
you're saving?

23:00.491 --> 23:03.097
‐ Caitlin, Chef.
‐ Jenny: Good job.

23:03.097 --> 23:05.301
Jeff: Yeah.
That was the right answer.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.307
Apron off please, Caitlin.
Third name?

23:08.307 --> 23:11.313
‐ Jenny, Chef.
‐ Gordon: Jenny.

23:13.384 --> 23:16.290
The fourth person
you're saving.

23:16.290 --> 23:20.632
‐ Reba, Chef.
‐ Thank you, Yachecia.

23:20.632 --> 23:22.135
The fifth person
you're saving is?

23:22.135 --> 23:24.205
‐ Dino, Chef.
‐ Good job.

23:28.648 --> 23:31.854
One person left
to put up on the balcony,

23:31.854 --> 23:36.396
and the remaining person
you'll go head to head with.

23:36.396 --> 23:38.200
Jeff:
<i>I know Yachecia's</i>
<i>coming for me.</i>

23:38.200 --> 23:40.204
We've already gone at it
with our challenge.

23:40.204 --> 23:43.010
<i>We've already gone at it</i>
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

23:43.010 --> 23:44.680
<i>You want to tangle,</i>
<i>let's tangle.</i>

23:44.680 --> 23:46.183
I dare you.

23:46.183 --> 23:48.755
The sixth and final name

23:48.755 --> 23:53.932
that you're sending
to the safety of the balcony

23:53.932 --> 23:58.140
‐ is who?
‐ Jeff, Chef.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.244
‐ Ooh.
‐ Wow.

24:00.244 --> 24:02.315
Thank you.

24:02.315 --> 24:04.085
Jeff definitely
deserves to be fighting
for his life today.

24:04.085 --> 24:08.026
<i>However, Jennifer will fall</i>
<i>apart under pressure,</i>

24:08.026 --> 24:09.563
just as she did
in the kitchen.

24:09.563 --> 24:12.503
Jennifer, are you surprised
you're down here?

24:12.503 --> 24:14.673
That's all right.
I want to know
what were cooking

24:14.673 --> 24:16.009
and I want to do it now.
I'm ready to go.

24:16.009 --> 24:17.613
‐ Whoo.
‐ I helped your team

24:17.613 --> 24:18.948
when we needed it.
We were ahead.

24:18.948 --> 24:20.585
I was one of the people
that made us ahead.

24:20.585 --> 24:21.754
And I helped all your team,

24:21.754 --> 24:22.890
which you should have
been doing.

24:22.890 --> 24:24.426
And now you still
have me down here.

24:24.426 --> 24:26.564
‐ Nothing personal.
‐ Nothing personal, either.

24:26.564 --> 24:29.302
‐ Let's go.
‐ It's hot in here.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.541
Are you both ready to find out
what you're gonna have to make

24:31.541 --> 24:33.043
‐ for this pressure test?
‐ Yes, Chef.

24:33.043 --> 24:34.312
Please turn around.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.287
Eboni:
Shucks.

24:40.257 --> 24:42.228
I'm shaking for 'em.

24:42.228 --> 24:45.769
Okay, tonight for
your tough pressure test,

24:45.769 --> 24:49.008
you'll be cooking a dish
that I grew up eating
at least once a week.

24:49.008 --> 24:51.747
To keep your place
in this competition,

24:51.747 --> 24:57.024
you'll be cooking
an incredible British classic‐‐
fish and chips.

24:57.024 --> 25:00.765
‐ Ooh!
‐ Ow!

25:00.765 --> 25:03.103
Look at it.
Crispy beer‐battered
white fish

25:03.103 --> 25:06.443
with delicious thick cut chips
with smashed fresh peas

25:06.443 --> 25:09.750
and finished off with
that incredible homemade
tartar sauce.

25:09.750 --> 25:13.558
And because I do not want
to hear any excuses tonight,

25:13.558 --> 25:14.927
I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

25:14.927 --> 25:17.666
‐ Please, watch carefully.
‐ Pay attention.

25:17.666 --> 25:19.770
Now, behind a perfect
fish and chips lies the batter.

25:19.770 --> 25:23.645
This is an incredible
beer batter.

25:23.645 --> 25:25.080
Mix in
the dry ingredients first.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.753
AP flour
followed by corn starch.

25:27.753 --> 25:31.092
Salt, baking soda.

25:31.092 --> 25:32.596
From there,
mix that in gently.

25:32.596 --> 25:33.998
Form a little well
in the middle

25:33.998 --> 25:38.140
and very carefully
add your beer.

25:38.140 --> 25:40.512
Don't add all the beer
at the same time,

25:40.512 --> 25:41.814
otherwise it's gonna
cause lumps.

25:41.814 --> 25:43.283
We want the batter
to be thick enough

25:43.283 --> 25:44.520
to coat the fish beautifully.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.826
And not too thin
so as it runs off the fish.

25:47.826 --> 25:49.495
Make it really nice and silky.

25:49.495 --> 25:52.335
‐ You can smell that batter
from there, right?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

25:52.335 --> 25:54.807
It's got a nice,
delicious richness to it.

25:54.807 --> 25:57.512
Now, the secret
is to let it rest.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.315
‐ Got me?
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:59.315 --> 26:01.954
Now, the fish.
So how do we get the moisture
out of there?

26:01.954 --> 26:06.029
We season the fish lightly.
It takes out any excess water.

26:06.029 --> 26:08.868
To make sure the fish
sticks to the batter,

26:08.868 --> 26:10.772
you run it through
seasoned flour

26:10.772 --> 26:13.645
and then shake off
any excess.

26:13.645 --> 26:16.984
And you lay that
inside your batter.

26:16.984 --> 26:21.059
Let it sink
and just coat the fish,

26:21.059 --> 26:25.334
and then very quickly
get rid of the excess batter.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.906
Let it coat and lay away.

26:27.906 --> 26:30.244
Those filets of fish
take 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.

26:30.244 --> 26:32.582
The secret now is to get
that batter nice and crispy

26:32.582 --> 26:34.820
‐ and beautifully seasoned.
‐ Mmm.

26:34.820 --> 26:37.324
Now, the chips.
Potatoes peeled.

26:37.324 --> 26:40.164
If they are cut evenly,
they'll cook evenly,
and all at the same time.

26:40.164 --> 26:42.836
Get your fries
straight into the fryer.

26:42.836 --> 26:46.109
Crank the heat up.
You want those
nice and crispy.

26:46.109 --> 26:47.512
Now the way to identify
when your fish is cooked,

26:47.512 --> 26:49.248
once that batter is coated,

26:49.248 --> 26:51.754
the fish starts to rise
inside the fryer.

26:51.754 --> 26:53.457
And if it starts to float,

26:53.457 --> 26:56.029
it's a strong indication
the fish is cooked beautifully.

26:56.029 --> 26:57.264
Let it rest.

26:59.903 --> 27:03.343
Fries out of the basket
into the bowl.

27:03.343 --> 27:05.247
Smoked paprika salt.

27:05.247 --> 27:08.420
Fresh chopped parsley
into a bowl,

27:08.420 --> 27:10.558
and coat your fries.

27:10.558 --> 27:12.194
And then take your cone.

27:12.194 --> 27:14.398
Big tall ones at the bottom

27:14.398 --> 27:17.037
and fill up that cone
with fries,

27:17.037 --> 27:20.277
making sure the fries
are nice and crisp.

27:20.277 --> 27:24.085
And then lightly season
your fish.

27:24.085 --> 27:28.460
And then up and over.

27:28.460 --> 27:30.364
That is how you make
a perfect

27:30.364 --> 27:33.103
MasterChef‐quality
fish and chips.

27:33.103 --> 27:35.274
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

27:35.274 --> 27:37.044
All right, guys.

27:37.044 --> 27:38.581
We do fish fries
all the time in church,

27:38.581 --> 27:40.050
<i>but we don't batter fry.</i>

27:40.050 --> 27:41.587
<i>We don't make fish and chips.</i>

27:41.587 --> 27:43.758
<i>This challenge is all</i>
<i>about timing.</i>

27:43.758 --> 27:45.762
The same reason
I got here is timing,

27:45.762 --> 27:47.599
<i>and so I gotta bring</i>
<i>my A‐game</i>

27:47.599 --> 27:51.507
in order for me to get
outta here and be safe.

27:51.507 --> 27:54.478
You two home cooks
will have just 45 minutes

27:54.478 --> 27:57.151
to get as close as you can
to Gordon's fish and chips.

27:57.151 --> 28:02.428
Your 45 minutes starts...
now.

28:02.428 --> 28:05.067
‐ Come on, Yachecia.
‐ You got this, girl.
You got this.

28:05.067 --> 28:07.706
Run, run, run, run, fast!

28:07.706 --> 28:10.043
Jennifer:
<i>I'm so mad right now.</i>

28:10.043 --> 28:12.147
I don't deserve to be
in a pressure test.

28:12.147 --> 28:13.718
<i>I'm trying my best</i>
<i>to hold it together,</i>

28:13.718 --> 28:17.559
‐ <i>but my insides</i>
<i>are screaming.</i>
‐ Corn starch.

28:17.559 --> 28:19.596
<i>Yachecia has this preconceived</i>
<i>notion that I'm a weak chef,</i>

28:19.596 --> 28:21.432
<i>and that just lights</i>
<i>a fire in me.</i>

28:21.432 --> 28:22.636
<i>I'm ready to go.</i>

28:22.636 --> 28:24.071
Let's rumble.
Let's do it.

28:24.071 --> 28:26.577
Showdown.
It's a showdown.

28:28.280 --> 28:30.417
All right, y'all.
All right, girls.

28:30.417 --> 28:32.956
‐ Please tell me
you've got everything.
‐ Come on, you two.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.031
Guys, head to head battle.
pressure test.

28:37.031 --> 28:40.270
Yachecia versus Jennifer.
This is going to be intense.

28:40.270 --> 28:42.174
Gordon:
Let's go!

28:42.174 --> 28:44.045
Stay focused, you guys.
Game time.

28:44.045 --> 28:45.815
Newton:
<i>Jennifer's got that look</i>
<i>of determination.</i>

28:45.815 --> 28:47.719
<i>I haven't seen this</i>
<i>in Jennifer yet.</i>

28:47.719 --> 28:49.990
That old "hell hath no fury
than a woman scorned."

28:49.990 --> 28:53.396
<i>Holy shnikes,</i>
<i>the catfight's about to begin.</i>

28:53.396 --> 28:56.202
And we're getting ready to see
one heck of a shootout.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.173
‐ All right, guys.
‐ Come on, guys.

28:58.173 --> 28:59.876
Guys, cook like it's
your last time.

29:06.623 --> 29:08.293
Gordon:
Ladies, remember,

29:08.293 --> 29:12.334
mushy peas,
tartar sauce,
fries, and fish.

29:12.334 --> 29:15.942
45 minutes to recreate
and perfect

29:15.942 --> 29:18.380
my fish and chips,
come on.

29:18.380 --> 29:20.117
Stay focused, you guys.
Game time.

29:20.117 --> 29:21.954
Dino:
<i>Culinary battle</i>
<i>of the ages.</i>

29:21.954 --> 29:23.891
<i>Jennifer, for the first time,</i>
<i>has that fire,</i>

29:23.891 --> 29:25.360
the fire that she should've
brought from the beginning.

29:25.360 --> 29:28.033
Redemption, Yachecia.
Redemption, both of you.
Keep it up.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.636
Caitlin:
<i>I think Yachecia's</i>
<i>gonna win.</i>

29:29.636 --> 29:31.640
<i>It shows confidence</i>
<i>in herself as a cook</i>

29:31.640 --> 29:33.644
that she decided to go
head to head with Jennifer.

29:33.644 --> 29:37.217
All right, so, fish and chips.
Something you grew up eating.

29:37.217 --> 29:38.587
‐ Yes.
‐ What are
the pitfalls, Gordon?

29:38.587 --> 29:40.424
'Cause this is not something
that I grew up eating.

29:40.424 --> 29:43.029
The key of a perfect fish
and chips is in the batter.

29:43.029 --> 29:44.432
‐ Yeah?
‐ Lightly salting that fish

29:44.432 --> 29:46.670
to make sure
you got rid of all
that excess moisture

29:46.670 --> 29:48.006
and keeping that batter
nice and crisp.

29:48.006 --> 29:49.241
The secret, though,
is to make sure

29:49.241 --> 29:51.680
that we get all those lumps
out of that batter,

29:51.680 --> 29:53.249
blend it beautifully,
and then let it rest.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.454
That is really,
really important.

29:55.454 --> 29:58.727
10 minutes gone,
35 minutes remaining.

29:58.727 --> 30:01.967
Okay,
how are you feeling?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.938
I'm feeling okay, Chef.
I'm a little nervous.

30:03.938 --> 30:06.944
You had the option to walk up
those frickin' stairs.

30:06.944 --> 30:08.914
True,
but at the end of the day,
I teach integrity.

30:08.914 --> 30:10.818
I teach love.
When you make a mistake,
you own it.

30:10.818 --> 30:12.722
‐ So, you're up against
tough competition.
‐ I am.

30:12.722 --> 30:15.828
I've never seen Jennifer
so feisty, determined,
and focused.

30:15.828 --> 30:18.166
‐ That's true.
‐ Tell me, the fish and chips.
What are you worried about?

30:18.166 --> 30:19.836
What's the one thing
that you're nervous about?

30:19.836 --> 30:21.339
Just making sure
that the fish is cooked
thoroughly,

30:21.339 --> 30:22.942
properly
all the way through,

30:22.942 --> 30:24.579
and that my fries
are nice and crispy.

30:24.579 --> 30:26.750
Mm‐hmm.
Highly commendable,
what you did.

30:26.750 --> 30:28.353
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Don't underestimate that.

30:28.353 --> 30:30.625
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Eye of the tiger, Yachecia.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.127
Man:
Keep it going.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.137
‐ Jennifer.
‐ How's it going?

30:37.137 --> 30:41.145
Why do you think Yachecia
chose to stay down here
and battle you head to head?

30:41.145 --> 30:43.651
I mean, hey,
she thinks I'm weak.
I get it.

30:43.651 --> 30:46.623
The thing is, though,
it's time for me
to prove myself,

30:46.623 --> 30:48.459
and this is maybe
my starting point.

30:48.459 --> 30:50.363
So you're gonna prove it
through fish and chips.

30:50.363 --> 30:53.136
You're from Louisiana,
25‐year‐old debt collector.

30:53.136 --> 30:54.806
You get a lot of fish
and chips down there?

30:54.806 --> 30:57.712
I've made fish and chips before.
I don't use the exact batter.

30:57.712 --> 31:01.252
It's very much about ratios.
It's about timing.
That's the main thing.

31:01.252 --> 31:03.924
I finished my batter.
It's sitting over there.
I'm working on my potatoes.

31:03.924 --> 31:05.427
Working all the sides
in a second,

31:05.427 --> 31:06.930
and I'll be good in the hood.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.032
Keep cool, keep focused.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.203
‐ You can do this.
‐ Yes.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.940
You got this, Jennifer.

31:11.940 --> 31:14.011
Gordon: Ladies,
we're down to ten minutes.

31:14.011 --> 31:15.781
Chips should be blanched.

31:15.781 --> 31:18.988
Fish should be salting.
Peas must be blanching.

31:18.988 --> 31:21.192
And tartar sauce
must be en route.

31:21.192 --> 31:23.363
Stay focused, guys.
You got this.

31:23.363 --> 31:25.868
Aarón: Speed up.
Come on, speed up.

31:25.868 --> 31:29.141
All right, now, Jennifer,
she was much more calm

31:29.141 --> 31:30.911
than the last pressure test
we saw her in.

31:30.911 --> 31:34.318
‐ No tears, more focused.
‐ Okay.

31:34.318 --> 31:36.088
But her batter looks
a little thick to me.

31:36.088 --> 31:37.090
Gordon:
But the secret is
to make sure

31:37.090 --> 31:38.727
you whisk it
two or three times

31:38.727 --> 31:40.531
‐ before you start putting
your fish in there.
‐ Yep.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.501
It starts to incorporate
and it will run thinner.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.006
You got it, Jen.

31:45.006 --> 31:46.510
Yachecia seems to have
a good handle on everything.

31:46.510 --> 31:49.248
She's not gonna get fazed
by all the drama.

31:49.248 --> 31:51.218
She just wants to
come here, redeem herself.

31:51.218 --> 31:53.289
I think both of them
are doing the same thing.

31:53.289 --> 31:55.293
They kind of seem to be
in parallel worlds

31:55.293 --> 31:57.699
as far as where they are
in the process.

31:57.699 --> 31:59.536
Jenny:
Nice job, ladies.

31:59.536 --> 32:00.905
So Yachecia's
dredging her fish.

32:00.905 --> 32:02.975
Jennifer's now
dredging the fish.

32:02.975 --> 32:06.248
‐ They're big pieces of fish.
‐ Oh, God, they're monsters.

32:06.248 --> 32:08.587
With fish that big
and that cold,

32:08.587 --> 32:10.223
what's gonna happen
to the temperature of the oil
when they go in?

32:10.223 --> 32:12.528
‐ It's gonna drop.
‐ It's gonna drop.

32:12.528 --> 32:14.733
That oil's not gonna heat up.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.235
Look, Yachecia's in.
Yachecia's in.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.507
Look at the size of her fish.
That's the perfect size of fish.

32:18.507 --> 32:22.882
‐ Wow.
‐ Beautiful. Yeah.

32:22.882 --> 32:26.088
42 minutes gone.
3 minutes remaining.

32:26.088 --> 32:28.459
Everything needs
to be finished

32:28.459 --> 32:31.533
and on that board
within three minutes.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.602
Let's go, Jennifer.
Put it in second gear.

32:32.602 --> 32:34.773
I don't have lemon.
( bleep )

32:34.773 --> 32:36.943
‐ Jennifer,
what have you forgotten?
‐ I forgot lemon, Chef.

32:36.943 --> 32:39.047
What's the one thing
you serve with fish?

32:39.047 --> 32:41.620
‐ Lemon, I know.
‐ Hey, Jennifer,
ask her for lemon.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.089
Maybe she'll give you one.

32:43.089 --> 32:45.059
Hey, Yachecia,
can I have part of your lemon?

32:47.999 --> 32:50.905
‐ Oh, thank you.
Yes. That's awesome.
‐ Wow.

32:50.905 --> 32:53.844
That's good sportsmanship.
That's good sportsmanship.

32:53.844 --> 32:55.313
‐ Very admirable of you.
‐ Yep, thank you.

32:55.313 --> 32:58.520
‐ Gordon: 90 seconds to go.
‐ Come on.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.023
Let's go, let's go!
You know what
you're doing, baby.

33:00.023 --> 33:02.027
Chips are out.
They look great.
Look at them.

33:02.027 --> 33:04.298
‐ Whoo.
‐ There you go, baby.

33:04.298 --> 33:07.070
Look at Yachecia's fish.
Just straight out of the oil.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.774
I'm hoping they're
going to season it now.

33:08.774 --> 33:11.713
‐ Christina:
Looks beautiful, Yachecia.
‐ Looking good, ladies.

33:11.713 --> 33:13.483
‐ 30 seconds remaining.
‐ Come on! Yes!

33:13.483 --> 33:17.257
Gordon:
Come on, Jennifer.
It's gotta be done.

33:17.257 --> 33:19.061
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on.

33:19.061 --> 33:21.733
Christina:
Check your fish.
Check your chips.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.770
Season everything.
Ten.

33:23.770 --> 33:26.910
All:
Nine, eight, seven,

33:26.910 --> 33:29.616
six, five, four,

33:29.616 --> 33:32.420
three, two, one.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.260
‐ Stop. Well done.
‐ ( cheers and applause )

33:35.260 --> 33:36.930
‐ Whoo!
‐ Baby doll!

33:36.930 --> 33:38.634
Beautiful, you two.

33:38.634 --> 33:40.303
Good job, ladies,
good job.

33:40.303 --> 33:42.942
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

33:42.942 --> 33:47.050
Very carefully bring
your fish and chip platters
down to the front, please.

33:47.050 --> 33:48.987
Jennifer:
<i>I look at Yachecia's plate</i>
<i>and my first thought</i>

33:48.987 --> 33:50.624
<i>is that her batter's</i>
<i>definitely darker</i>

33:50.624 --> 33:53.630
<i>than how I would make it.</i>
<i>Her chips don't look as good.</i>

33:53.630 --> 33:55.466
She didn't cut them correctly,
and they look a little limp.

33:55.466 --> 33:59.742
<i>So it's time</i>
<i>for Yachecia to go home.</i>

33:59.742 --> 34:01.478
Yachecia:
<i>Jennifer's dish looks</i>
<i>like it came</i>

34:01.478 --> 34:02.782
<i>from a fast food restaurant.</i>

34:02.782 --> 34:05.453
Mine looks like it came
from Chef Ramsay's restaurant.

34:05.453 --> 34:08.025
Amazing, both of you.

34:08.025 --> 34:11.432
<i>I think I did his dish</i>
<i>justice today.</i>

34:11.432 --> 34:14.706
Right, Yachecia,
let's start with you.

34:14.706 --> 34:17.043
Okay, visually,
that looks beautiful.

34:17.043 --> 34:20.350
Great color on the fries.
Great color on the fish.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.456
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ But we know the flavor
is something else.

34:23.456 --> 34:24.659
Correct.

34:26.328 --> 34:27.531
Can you hear that
from over there?

34:27.531 --> 34:29.067
‐ Crispy.
‐ Crispy!

34:29.067 --> 34:30.571
When I cut through there,

34:30.571 --> 34:34.545
I want to see glistening
flakes of cod encrusted

34:34.545 --> 34:35.981
with this incredible batter.

34:44.532 --> 34:46.435
Yachecia,
that is beautiful.

34:46.435 --> 34:47.437
Thank you, Chef.

34:50.176 --> 34:51.378
How long did you
salt the fish for?

34:51.378 --> 34:53.282
I salted the fish
for about 20 minutes

34:53.282 --> 34:55.286
and let it sit.

34:55.286 --> 34:58.459
‐ Fries.
‐ Fries, I blanched them.

34:58.459 --> 35:00.931
No color,
finished frying them off,

35:00.931 --> 35:04.839
and seasoned them
with smoked paprika sea salt.

35:04.839 --> 35:06.676
You know,
the fish is beautiful.
Let's get that right.

35:06.676 --> 35:10.551
Salted beautifully,
nice and firm.
Tartar sauce, delicious.

35:10.551 --> 35:12.020
However, your fries
are so thick.

35:12.020 --> 35:15.561
When they're that thick,
they get sort of
soft and soggy.

35:15.561 --> 35:17.898
But you're 85%
of the way there.

35:17.898 --> 35:21.071
What has been confirmed
over the last 45 minutes,

35:21.071 --> 35:23.910
‐ you can handle pressure.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

35:23.910 --> 35:25.079
‐ Good job.
‐ Thank you.

35:26.850 --> 35:29.589
‐ Miss Yachecia.
‐ Yes, Chef?

35:29.589 --> 35:30.924
How long did you fry
that fish?

35:30.924 --> 35:34.097
‐ Six minutes.
‐ It's like riding the line.

35:34.097 --> 35:35.701
Yes, Chef.
It's a big piece of fish.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.605
I didn't want it
to be underdone in any way.

35:37.605 --> 35:39.074
Did you get a bite
of this fish?

35:39.074 --> 35:40.409
Not the finished product,
no, ma'am.

35:42.815 --> 35:44.752
What about these mushy peas?

35:44.752 --> 35:46.421
They're not too
mushed up there.

35:46.421 --> 35:47.591
Did you just
run out of time?

35:47.591 --> 35:50.329
Yeah, and then I realized
that I had to make certain

35:50.329 --> 35:51.966
that the star was the star

35:51.966 --> 35:55.239
and that the accompaniments
accompanied the star.

35:55.239 --> 35:57.611
And then I think the color
on these chips are great,

35:57.611 --> 35:59.816
but when I look
at the size of them,

35:59.816 --> 36:02.020
I would love to see
better uniformity,

36:02.020 --> 36:03.590
because when you go
to fry them,

36:03.590 --> 36:04.792
they're all gonna
fry differently

36:04.792 --> 36:06.295
if they're different
sizes, right?

36:06.295 --> 36:07.965
Yes, ma'am.

36:07.965 --> 36:09.902
I think that your fish
is absolutely the star.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.908
I think your chips leave
a little bit to be desired.

36:12.908 --> 36:15.146
And peas fall just
a little bit short for me.

36:15.146 --> 36:16.749
Thank you, Chef.

36:18.920 --> 36:22.728
Jennifer. Right.

36:22.728 --> 36:24.565
So, I'm gonna be honest

36:24.565 --> 36:27.070
and I'm gonna
call it straight here
from the naked eye.

36:27.070 --> 36:30.343
Look at the size
of your fish.
What happened?

36:30.343 --> 36:33.482
I know they're huge,
but I think that
my batter's good.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.453
And I'm hoping that it's done
and it's crispy.

36:35.453 --> 36:38.459
Visually it looks
inproportionate.

36:38.459 --> 36:40.931
However, we know
it's all about what?

36:40.931 --> 36:42.601
‐ The fish.
‐ The flavor.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.972
‐ Yes.
‐ It's exactly that.

36:44.972 --> 36:47.645
Now, let's cut through
into the center.

36:50.784 --> 36:52.821
Did you use all the beer?

36:52.821 --> 36:54.825
‐ Yes.
‐ You did.

37:02.908 --> 37:06.181
Wow.

37:06.181 --> 37:07.685
Wow.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.307
Now, let's cut through
into the center.

37:24.652 --> 37:27.156
‐ Ooh.
‐ The batter is
way too thick.

37:27.156 --> 37:29.160
Yes, Chef, I see that.

37:35.306 --> 37:38.980
Okay, um, the fish actually
tastes better than it looks.

37:38.980 --> 37:43.322
Got the chips nailed.
I think your peas,
they're tasty.

37:43.322 --> 37:46.328
‐ But the hero
tonight is what?
‐ The fish, Chef.

37:46.328 --> 37:47.564
That is not
your best performance.

37:47.564 --> 37:49.568
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ Damn.

37:58.720 --> 38:02.060
The chips are dynamite.
They're beyond reproach.
They're amazing.

38:02.060 --> 38:04.364
The tartar sauce,
it's filled with lots

38:04.364 --> 38:06.001
of yummy bits
of the cornichon.

38:06.001 --> 38:08.038
That should be in a bottle
with "Jennifer" on it.

38:08.038 --> 38:10.242
That's how good it is.

38:10.242 --> 38:14.050
But the fish, I mean,
it just doesn't look right.

38:14.050 --> 38:15.921
I understand that.
Yes, Chef.

38:19.027 --> 38:20.329
Ladies, come around
to the front.

38:22.835 --> 38:25.674
Hold y'all heads high.

38:25.674 --> 38:26.909
Please just give us
one moment.

38:28.746 --> 38:31.752
Gordon: So, Yachecia,
fish cooked beautifully.

38:31.752 --> 38:33.690
The one issue I have
is the fries.

38:33.690 --> 38:36.696
‐ Clumsy with the chips.
‐ The chips, I think, yeah,
they need a lot of work.

38:36.696 --> 38:39.735
Gordon: Jennifer,
the actual batter is so thick.

38:39.735 --> 38:42.373
But you've got perfect fries.
Tartar sauce, done beautifully.

38:42.373 --> 38:44.377
‐ Aarón: Unbelievable.
‐ Peas, delicious.

38:44.377 --> 38:46.649
Christina:
Technique is where
she fell short.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.594
Ladies, based purely
on these dishes you cooked
this evening,

38:52.594 --> 38:56.101
one of you is leaving
the MasterChef kitchen,

38:56.101 --> 38:57.738
and one is still in
with a chance

38:57.738 --> 39:01.444
of becoming America's
next MasterChef.

39:01.444 --> 39:06.221
The person staying is...

39:10.530 --> 39:11.732
Yachecia.

39:11.732 --> 39:12.901
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ Job well done.

39:12.901 --> 39:15.039
Great job, Yachecia.

39:15.039 --> 39:16.408
( muttering )

39:18.378 --> 39:19.982
‐ Well done, young lady.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.384
Good job.

39:23.723 --> 39:25.894
Gordon:
Oh, Jennifer, honestly,

39:25.894 --> 39:27.731
you're going home
way too early

39:27.731 --> 39:29.267
in our eyes.
How do you feel?

39:29.267 --> 39:31.739
I know that
I've been a crybaby,

39:31.739 --> 39:34.110
but thank y'all so much
for this opportunity,

39:34.110 --> 39:36.782
for everything
that you have shown me,

39:36.782 --> 39:39.287
to push me to be
the best person I can be

39:39.287 --> 39:42.026
and the best cook
that I can be.

39:42.026 --> 39:45.332
I have grown so much
in this past couple of weeks

39:45.332 --> 39:47.704
than I could ever grow
in two years.

39:47.704 --> 39:51.211
Thank you so much
for everything.

39:51.211 --> 39:53.048
Aarón:
Well, let me tell you,
Jennifer,

39:53.048 --> 39:55.954
I know it didn't kinda
work out for you tonight,

39:55.954 --> 39:57.557
but you have
such a great foundation

39:57.557 --> 39:59.193
just by virtue
of where you live.

39:59.193 --> 40:01.064
The food culture
in Louisiana is so bright.

40:01.064 --> 40:02.300
That's why I chose
to move there,

40:02.300 --> 40:04.404
to have my restaurants there.

40:04.404 --> 40:07.243
So if you ever need some time
to get better at your skills,

40:07.243 --> 40:09.982
my doors are always open,
all right?

40:14.925 --> 40:17.063
‐ Thank you.
‐ Gordon: You've been great.

40:17.063 --> 40:19.568
Please, Jennifer,
take your apron off,

40:19.568 --> 40:21.772
place it on your bench,
and head home.

40:21.772 --> 40:23.576
‐ Thank y'all so much. Okay.
‐ Thank you.

40:23.576 --> 40:25.947
‐ Thank y'all.
‐ That was awesome!

40:25.947 --> 40:30.523
This Louisiana girl
who made it to the top 16
of "MasterChef"‐‐

40:30.523 --> 40:32.961
<i>if I can do it,</i>
<i>anybody can do it.</i>

40:32.961 --> 40:35.700
<i>So if you ever have</i>
<i>any question in your mind</i>

40:35.700 --> 40:38.105
that you're not good enough
or you're not doing something

40:38.105 --> 40:40.442
and you're unhappy,
change your life.

40:40.442 --> 40:42.614
‐ We love you, Jen.
‐ We love you, Jennifer!

40:42.614 --> 40:44.083
We love you.

40:44.083 --> 40:45.754
<i>No more debt collecting.</i>

40:45.754 --> 40:47.791
<i>I'm not gonna be</i>
<i>knocking on doors.</i>

40:47.791 --> 40:49.127
I'm gonna go back
to New Orleans

40:49.127 --> 40:50.563
and I'm gonna go
to Aarón's restaurant.

40:50.563 --> 40:52.500
<i>I'm gonna take him up</i>
<i>on that offer.</i>

40:52.500 --> 40:54.972
And hopefully one day
I'll have a restaurant

40:54.972 --> 40:56.742
and I'll be right down
the street from him.

40:56.742 --> 40:59.848
‐ Bye, Jennifer.
‐ Bye, guys. Love y'all.

40:59.848 --> 41:01.151
‐ Love you.
‐ Bye, Jennifer.

41:05.459 --> 41:07.062
‐ Announcer: <i>Next week...</i>
‐ Christina: Please welcome...

41:07.062 --> 41:09.902
‐ ( lowing )
‐ Daisy the cow!

41:09.902 --> 41:11.806
Daisy looks like
she needs milking really bad.

41:11.806 --> 41:13.876
<i>It's a mystery box</i>
<i>challenge...</i>

41:13.876 --> 41:16.916
‐ ( chuckles )
‐ <i>...that requires</i>
<i>"udder" perfection.</i>

41:16.916 --> 41:18.820
‐ Very nice job.
‐ Gordon: It's delicious.

41:18.820 --> 41:20.155
It's one of the best things
you've cooked.

41:20.155 --> 41:22.326
‐ <i>And then...</i>
‐ I'm good.

41:22.326 --> 41:24.565
Announcer:
<i>the "steaks" are higher</i>
<i>than ever before,</i>

41:24.565 --> 41:25.767
<i>as an elimination test...</i>

41:25.767 --> 41:28.071
Gordon:
Speed up, guys. Let's go.

41:28.071 --> 41:30.142
<i>leads to a performance</i>
<i>so shocking...</i>

41:30.142 --> 41:32.781
I'm confused.
I don't understand
what's going on.

41:32.781 --> 41:35.653
<i>it leaves</i>
<i>the judges speechless.</i>
