[dramatic music]

00:09.243 --> 00:11.345
- My name is Brian Ronghall.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.082
For me, bladesmithing
is a spiritual event.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.516
It is an act of creation.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.519
It is metallurgical magic.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.122
- My name is Josh Fenlon.
I started bladesmithing

00:21.155 --> 00:23.091
'cause when my dad started
doing it as a hobby,

00:23.124 --> 00:25.293
it just gave me
some inspiration.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.196
My father was on the show.
He didn't win.

00:28.229 --> 00:31.732
And I'm here to avenge my
father and I wanna win.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.434
- I'm Richard Moore.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.403
I named my forge
Misfortune Forge because

00:35.436 --> 00:37.605
very bad things happen to me.

00:37.638 --> 00:40.108
Rocks fly out of nowhere,
a wild animal tried to eat me,

00:40.141 --> 00:41.275
struck by lightning...

00:41.309 --> 00:42.343

00:45.579 --> 00:47.515
I'm from Juneau, Alaska.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.718
I moved out of Florida
into Alaska because I really

00:50.751 --> 00:53.154
don't like dealing with people.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.788
You know, when I'm in my shop,

00:54.822 --> 00:56.757
I may have a bear
walking by the front door,

00:56.790 --> 00:59.760
I've got the eagles
screeching outside--

00:59.793 --> 01:01.395
and it's just
a beautiful sound.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.431
*

01:03.464 --> 01:05.199
[tense music]

01:05.233 --> 01:06.700
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to The Forge.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.802
*

01:08.836 --> 01:10.838
You're here for three rounds
of timed edged-weapon making

01:10.871 --> 01:13.474
competition in front
of our panel of expert judges.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.309
Let's meet them now.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.811
Two-time "Forged in Fire"
champion Ben Abbott.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.314
Historic weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.716
Kali martial artist
Doug Marcaida.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.385
All right, gentlemen,

01:24.418 --> 01:26.387
let's go ahead
and jump right into this.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.622
On your anvils, you'll see
a rusty piece of chain mail.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.558
Go ahead and lift that up.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.126
*

01:32.160 --> 01:34.128
You will be using
1084 steel

01:34.162 --> 01:36.230
along with that
chain mail drape

01:36.264 --> 01:39.533
to forge a Knights Templar
Crusader dagger.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.735
Carried by medieval knights,

01:41.769 --> 01:43.837
these double-edged daggers
featuring a cruciform guard

01:43.871 --> 01:45.906
were used as a second line
of defense in combat

01:45.939 --> 01:47.608
to penetrate enemy armor.

01:47.641 --> 01:50.144
The blade parameters
are as follows.

01:50.178 --> 01:53.847
Your templar dagger must be
between 13 and 15 inches

01:53.881 --> 01:55.883
in length,
not including the tang.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.551
The overall length
of your weapon

01:57.585 --> 01:59.720
must not exceed 22 inches.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.889
- This dagger has
a double edge,

02:01.922 --> 02:04.392
so that's pretty much
almost twice the work.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.327
- Keep in mind that
after the second round,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.462
we'll be testing your blades
for strength and durability

02:08.496 --> 02:10.431
in a chain mail armor stab...

02:10.464 --> 02:13.301
and for sharpness
in a fish fillet.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.902
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:14.935 --> 02:17.538
Your three-hour forge time
starts now.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.474
[rock music]

02:20.508 --> 02:22.410
*

02:22.443 --> 02:25.379
- So, Dave, what makes
a Crusader's dagger different

02:25.413 --> 02:27.515
than any other dagger?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.583
- Ideally, they're gonna have
a long extended triangle

02:29.617 --> 02:31.919
with a supporting ridge
down the center of the blade.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.787
The idea was to make
a weapon that you could

02:33.821 --> 02:35.656
actually thrust
through chain mail.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.392
*

02:38.426 --> 02:40.394
- They're given already
a clue right here.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.363
They're given chain mail
to mix with their blade.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.931
Look at the chain mail.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.400
Look at the radius of that
and design something

02:46.434 --> 02:48.202
that's gonna pierce
through those holes.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.305
*

02:51.339 --> 02:53.907
- When my dad was on the show,
he did the best he could

02:53.941 --> 02:56.544
but he got a little
overwhelmed, then he

02:56.577 --> 02:58.579
just made some mistakes.
- [groans]

02:58.612 --> 03:00.281
The wrong thing's bendin'.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.250
- So, I'm gonna
stay calm and focus

03:02.283 --> 03:03.851
so that I can
pound out a better blade

03:03.884 --> 03:05.753
faster than him.

03:05.786 --> 03:07.621
But a little nervous
using the power hammer

03:07.655 --> 03:09.490
'cause I do not
have one at home,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.825
so I'm just gonna
take it easy at first

03:11.859 --> 03:13.961
and just learn it
and get it done right.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.596
- This is what
I was worried about.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.398
When people start out
with a round rod,

03:17.431 --> 03:19.433
you see him
drawing that rod out

03:19.467 --> 03:20.801
longer and longer,
and leaner and leaner,

03:20.834 --> 03:23.871
but he's not doing any fuller.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.274
- Dave, I have a feeling
we're gonna see a lot of

03:26.307 --> 03:28.409
long, skinny blades.
- [laughs] Yeah.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.010
*

03:30.043 --> 03:31.812
- I always like
to push my limits,

03:31.845 --> 03:34.582
so I'm going for
a much more complex build.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.017
I wanna make kinda like a box
out of the high carbon steel

03:37.050 --> 03:39.019
so it'd be like
almost a canister Damascus

03:39.052 --> 03:42.022
but with a core inside
with the chain mail.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.292
- So he made it into a boat.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.826
- Yup, and then he's gonna
leave a little channel

03:45.859 --> 03:47.695
in the middle for
some of that chain,

03:47.728 --> 03:49.397
and then put the lid on.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.632
- If I get to see
another method at work,

03:51.665 --> 03:53.367
that's so far out of the box--
- Yeah.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.335
- I just love that.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.938
*

03:57.971 --> 03:59.707
- What am I gonna do
with this [bleep] thing?

03:59.740 --> 04:02.543
- I think that this
wad of rusty chain mail

04:02.576 --> 04:05.279
has thrown most
of these guys for a loop.

04:05.313 --> 04:07.281
For a whole series
of interlocking loops.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.649
[laughter]

04:08.682 --> 04:09.983
*

04:10.017 --> 04:11.752
- Chain mail is just

04:11.785 --> 04:13.687
a bunch
of little round rings.

04:13.721 --> 04:15.889
There's so much space,
so much room

04:15.923 --> 04:18.859
for crud and crap
to get caught in.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.028
I don't want them to be
picking at it and saying,

04:21.061 --> 04:22.830
[sputtering]
This is a bad blade!

04:22.863 --> 04:25.399
Cold shut.
Looks like hell.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.568
I want it as clean
a blade as I can have

04:27.601 --> 04:30.471
and by incorporating
it in the tang,

04:30.504 --> 04:33.974
even though it'll
be covered up, it's there.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.344
[electricity crackling,
hammering]

04:36.377 --> 04:39.480
- This chain mail
is basically

04:39.513 --> 04:42.049
stuff that you would use
for Halloween.

04:42.082 --> 04:44.552
Proper mail
that is period correct

04:44.585 --> 04:46.820
would be hardened,
would be high tensile strength.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.022
- Brian putting on a little
piece of chain mail there.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.525
- Since it's basically
mild steel,

04:51.559 --> 04:54.728
I'm going to put it
where it's visible

04:54.762 --> 04:57.398
but not going to affect
critical function.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.999
- That's the game
that we're playing, though,

04:59.032 --> 05:01.902
to test their ability
to think about things.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.572
We never gave parameters
of how much mild steel

05:04.605 --> 05:07.375
or chain length they have
to do, but we gave them a lot.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.643
[bass music]

05:09.677 --> 05:11.912
- My strategy
with this chain mail is

05:11.945 --> 05:13.947
try to get it
as solid as I can

05:13.981 --> 05:16.517
and I think I'm gonna
have to forge weld.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.386
So I want it on the handle,
and, you know,

05:18.419 --> 05:19.787
obviously 'cause
this is mild steel

05:19.820 --> 05:21.955
and I don't want
it on the blade.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.392
*

05:24.425 --> 05:26.727
- The chain mail is rusty,
and I hope it doesn't affect

05:26.760 --> 05:29.096
the forge weld,
'cause when you forge weld,

05:29.129 --> 05:32.099
you definitely do not wanna
deal with dirty metal.

05:32.132 --> 05:34.435
But I don't know how
I would clean chain mail.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.637
[machine whirring]

05:36.670 --> 05:38.071
All right, looks good, looks
like I got a nice, solid weld.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.642
- Bladesmiths!
One hour has elapsed.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.010
- You got the chain mail
welded in?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.645
- Oh, no.
I'm just taking my time.

05:44.678 --> 05:45.879
- Oh, you didn't
get it on there yet?

05:45.913 --> 05:47.681
- No, I'm doing that next.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.751
Whenever I look at a--
how to do something,

05:50.784 --> 05:53.721
I dissect the objective
from another angle that

05:53.754 --> 05:55.556
other people don't look at.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.858
I have an idea
that might just work.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.428
- Richard's got powdered steel?
- Yeah, flux.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.862
- It's like
playing with flour,

06:01.895 --> 06:03.464
except I'm not making
bread or a cake.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.666
- Gonna pour water in it.
- Ay-yi-yi.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.736
- Oh, yeah, man.
What's happening right now?

06:08.769 --> 06:11.472
- When you melt flux, it gets
very, very sticky, right?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.040
He's making metal glue.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.142
- I've never seen
this before in my life.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.111
- I'm making mud out of the
chain mail, some steel filings,

06:18.145 --> 06:20.748
mix them up with a little bit
of water and borax in

06:20.781 --> 06:23.951
to help kind of make it settle
in when you forge weld it.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.454
Hopefully it'll close up
the gaps all good.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.589
- Is this gonna work?
- It could.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.023
It is also a good possibility

06:30.057 --> 06:31.992
he's gonna have
to void a flux.

06:32.025 --> 06:35.095
- Also, H2O that he's mixed
in there--all of those gases

06:35.128 --> 06:37.197
have to come out of there.
- Oh, yeah.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.132
- For that to happen,
it's gotta find a vent.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.735
- Yeah, hopefully he doesn't
weld it very tightly.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.604
- Richard's doing
a lot of weird stuff.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.106
And I don't wanna say
it's because

06:46.139 --> 06:48.709
he was struck by lightning.
[laughter]

06:50.544 --> 06:52.613
[rock music]

06:52.646 --> 06:54.081
- I had a little incident
with, uh, lightning.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.916
Taking a cruise up the hill,
and all of sudden

06:55.949 --> 06:57.751
everything went white.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.820
And I wake up
about four hours later.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.022
The ground's still warm.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.858
I notice that my left shoe is
partially melted on the heel.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.561
Hair is burnt off
the left side of my body.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.162
I don't think it was
a direct strike,

07:09.196 --> 07:11.899
but may have messed up
a few things.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.034
*

07:14.067 --> 07:16.670
- I'm just dying to see
if this all works out.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.138
*

07:18.171 --> 07:20.608
- Creating a dagger
is difficult

07:20.641 --> 07:23.243
because you have
to maintain symmetry.

07:23.276 --> 07:27.080
The edge needs to be straight
and sharp on both sides

07:27.114 --> 07:30.083
and each side
should be the same.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.219
*

07:32.252 --> 07:33.921
- I think that they forgot
to tell Brian

07:33.954 --> 07:35.856
that we have
belt grinders here.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.560
- The angle grinder
is the go-to tool in my shop.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.062
And I'm much more prone

07:42.095 --> 07:44.498
to dance with the one
who brought me.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.266
*

07:46.299 --> 07:48.035
- Dave would probably
be the most critical

07:48.068 --> 07:50.771
on this style dagger,
so I wanna make sure

07:50.804 --> 07:52.606
that he can recognize that
that's a Crusader dagger.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.575
[muttering]

07:54.608 --> 07:56.910
I try to forge as close
to shape as possible.

07:56.944 --> 07:58.946
This is "Forged in Fire."

07:58.979 --> 08:00.914
I don't grind the tip in.
I forge it in.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.850
Jeez!

08:02.883 --> 08:05.252
- Check out David.
It looks pretty damn good.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.987
- It's not as wide
as I'd like to see it,

08:07.020 --> 08:09.890
to make a truly-shaped
Templar dagger.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.759
[tense music]

08:11.792 --> 08:14.595
- There's not enough mass
in Brian's blade either.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.164
- Everybody's blade
is looking very lean.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.700
It's the magic
of the big blue hypnosis--

08:19.733 --> 08:21.068
longer, and longer, and longer.

08:21.101 --> 08:24.204
- Okay. Hello.
Hammer time.

08:24.237 --> 08:28.942
[rock music]

08:28.976 --> 08:30.611
- Now, would you look at that.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.280
We've got a very wide billet
with Richard.

08:33.313 --> 08:36.984
- If that's one piece, I think
he's in a much better situation

08:37.017 --> 08:39.052
to have the dagger
that I expect to see.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.254
- Everybody else just has like
a long skinny blade,

08:41.288 --> 08:44.291
but here's Richard
doing something new.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.326
- Oh, that one was aggressive.
- Oh!

08:46.359 --> 08:49.162
- Ah, there you go, wow.
- What is he doing?

08:49.196 --> 08:54.167
- Oh!
- Ah, [bleep].

08:54.201 --> 08:57.070
- We've got a very wide billet
with Richard.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.306
- I think he's in a much better
situation to have

08:59.339 --> 09:01.575
the dagger
that I expect to see.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.777
- I realize once I
start drawing out the billet

09:03.811 --> 09:06.113
that I accidentally got it
too thin in several places,

09:06.146 --> 09:08.749
and I opened up
a couple of cold shuts.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.953
So I decided to fold the billet
over to try to close it up.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.221
- Ahh.
- Wow.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.989
Ooh.
- What is he doing?

09:16.023 --> 09:18.325
- Oh!
- [laughs] [bleep]

09:18.358 --> 09:20.961
- Look at that.
- Aww.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.130
- Why?

09:23.163 --> 09:24.798
- Honestly,
this is not a bad idea.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.868
No, I mean, look,

09:27.901 --> 09:30.871
if you've got voids in welds
that aren't holding,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.006
what he is doing is not
the worst thing he could do.

09:33.040 --> 09:36.209
The problem is, is that there's
gonna be a lot of forge scale

09:36.243 --> 09:38.679
on that taco that he built up.
He did no cleaning,

09:38.712 --> 09:42.315
so the question isn't whether
that's going to weld up or not.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.222
- [bleep].

09:49.256 --> 09:51.358
That is [bleep] close.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.360
Cut off 1/2 inch too much.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.029
The blade is coming up just
a little bit too short.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.799
Must of checked it
half a dozen times.

09:58.832 --> 10:02.903
I would fall on my blade
if I made it too short.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.338
Just have to make it happen.
You have to be able to adapt.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.407
You have to be able
to use your brain

10:07.440 --> 10:09.910
to figure out another way
to get around something.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.679
Plenty of material
at the ricasso,

10:11.712 --> 10:13.046
so that's what
I'm heating out now

10:13.080 --> 10:14.815
to gain my extra length.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.750
I don't
wanna forge the tip out more

10:16.784 --> 10:18.819
since we're gonna be stabbing
through chain mail.

10:18.852 --> 10:20.087
So I wanna keep
the meat on the tip.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.289
*

10:22.322 --> 10:25.058
- And Josh--he's got a really
aggressive, neat-looking dagger

10:25.092 --> 10:27.294
just not as wide
as I'd like it to be.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.229
- I got a good shape.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
Got the chain mail in there
which was required.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.200
I gotta make sure
it's in parameter.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.669
Perfect.
Gonna go for the quench.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.305
Usually, I'm used to just
quenching the edge,

10:38.338 --> 10:40.407
and this blade has two edges.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.910
So how am I gonna quench
both of these edges

10:42.943 --> 10:47.280
at the same time without
getting the spine too hard?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.683
If the spine gets too hard
during the testing,

10:49.717 --> 10:51.418
the blade
could actually snap in two,

10:51.451 --> 10:53.453
and that'd be catastrophic.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.890
So I wanna use this clay
to keep that spine soft

10:56.924 --> 10:58.959
so the blade
has some flexibility,

10:58.992 --> 11:01.061
and I want both edges hard.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.062
There we go.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.263
- Josh has quenched.

11:03.296 --> 11:06.166
*

11:06.199 --> 11:08.001
[tense music]
- I think Brian

11:08.035 --> 11:09.903
has finished
with his thermal cycling.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.038
- Oh, we got a quench coming?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.306
- I believe--
- Quench!

11:13.340 --> 11:14.341
- Booyah.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.176
[rock music]

11:16.209 --> 11:18.712
- I file test
after the first quench.

11:18.746 --> 11:21.782
It seems to be digging
in more than it should.

11:21.815 --> 11:25.318
So I go back into the fire.

11:25.352 --> 11:28.221
Try to distribute the heat
a little bit more.

11:28.255 --> 11:32.425
When I am absolutely sure that
it is as good as it can be,

11:32.459 --> 11:36.096
as far as the heat goes,
we go back to the oil.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.065
[dramatic music]

11:38.098 --> 11:41.101
- There we go,
Brian's back in the quench.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.838
- God's gotta cooperate
if God wants to, of course.

11:44.872 --> 11:47.941
All I can think of is,
holy mother of God.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.276
- We'll see what happens.

11:49.309 --> 11:51.478
*

11:51.511 --> 11:53.080
- This time I'm satisfied.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.884
[dramatic chords]

11:56.917 --> 11:59.152
- David just quenched.
Richard in the quench.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.922
- Got a quenched blade.
- 90 seconds!

12:01.955 --> 12:03.290
- Get to the grinder.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.325
- Go, go, go.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.762
- Richard, on his knees,
praying to the grinder gods

12:08.796 --> 12:11.298
to get this done
in the last 50 seconds.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.266
- Trying to remove
as much scale as I can

12:13.300 --> 12:15.135
so I could see
where the cold shuts are,

12:15.168 --> 12:17.104
if they are there.
Did they close?

12:17.137 --> 12:18.839
At least I can try and see
if they're closed or open.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.774
That's the only chance
I really would got.

12:20.808 --> 12:23.811
[dramatic music]

12:23.844 --> 12:25.245
- David. Done.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.380
Brian. Done.
Blade on the anvil.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.316
Josh. Still working.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.517
He's been at that grinder
for a while.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.019
The blade looks clean.

12:32.052 --> 12:33.787
Meanwhile, we've got Richard

12:33.821 --> 12:36.489
grinding for all
he's worth in the last

12:36.523 --> 12:38.391
ten, nine,

12:38.425 --> 12:40.828
eight, seven,

12:40.861 --> 12:42.830
six, five,

12:42.863 --> 12:44.998
four, three,

12:45.032 --> 12:47.300
two, one.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.136
Bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

12:49.169 --> 12:51.404
This round is over!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.206
- Oh!

12:53.240 --> 12:56.109
- That was entertaining.
- [laughing]

12:56.143 --> 12:58.078
- I shouldn't have took
so many risks.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.312
I should've just kept
it simple, but...

12:59.346 --> 13:00.447
that's just not my character.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.515
- That was exhausting.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.084
Going into this critique
was, you know,

13:04.117 --> 13:06.019
it's got me a little worried

13:06.053 --> 13:07.888
'cause they were pretty harsh
on my dad.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.389
Hopefully, I'm gonna do
a lot better than him.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.124
[tense music]
- All right, Bladesmiths,

13:11.158 --> 13:13.093
over the course
of the last three hours,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.962
each of you
has attempted to forge

13:14.995 --> 13:17.164
a Knights Templar
Crusader dagger.

13:17.197 --> 13:18.832
Now it's time for the judges

13:18.866 --> 13:19.967
to take a closer look
at your work.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.368
Brian, you're up first.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.837
Please present your work
to the judges.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.139
*
- Well, Brian,

13:26.173 --> 13:28.341
I like to see
the chain on a blade.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.943
Kind of a nice touch
to be able to actually see it.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.879
But it is a rough blade.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.547
The profile's got
a lot of wiggle to it.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.017
And there's a bit of a warp
to the tang.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.886
If this were to go forward
into the next round,

13:38.919 --> 13:40.587
there is some grinding
that will need refinement.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.922
- Thank you.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.123
- Josh, you're up.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.227
- All right, Josh, this is
what I like about your design.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.262
We're thrusting
into chain mail.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.064
The more acute your tip,

13:51.098 --> 13:53.033
the more it's gonna find
that hole and dig in.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.035
I love that about
your design over here.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.269
That aggressive point.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.871
- Thanks.

13:57.905 --> 14:00.040
- It would've been nice to see

14:00.073 --> 14:03.610
something with that kind of a
tip with a base that was wide.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.546
I just worry that
it's already very lean.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.016
If you move forward, you're
gonna have to really be careful

14:09.049 --> 14:12.319
not to lose more of that mass.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.154
- David, you're up.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.655
[rock music]
- Well, David,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.457
it's a solid piece.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.059
I like the shape of it.
I like where

14:19.092 --> 14:20.961
you're going
with these grinds.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.662
The profile is good.
A little bit thick up here.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.632
I'd like to see
a more acute tip.

14:25.665 --> 14:28.301
- What I like is that
down the center,

14:28.335 --> 14:30.303
we've got enough material
to work that edge

14:30.337 --> 14:32.105
and put that ridge in.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.673
That's so important
on a dagger like this.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.308
- Thank you.
- All right, Richard.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.510
*

14:37.544 --> 14:40.080
- You did a canister technique
and a taco technique.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.615
- Not the greatest, uh,
combination of ideas together.

14:42.649 --> 14:47.620
- I'm not so sure how
structurally sound this is.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.490
What we've got right now
is something that's very thin,

14:50.523 --> 14:53.994
and so putting any kind
of spine on this blade

14:54.027 --> 14:55.362
would be very, very difficult

14:55.395 --> 14:56.696
without losing
a lot of material.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.598
But if you move forward,
we'll see.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.467
- All right, bladesmiths.
At this time,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.502
the judges need
to make a final decision

15:02.535 --> 15:04.237
about who's moving forward
in this competition.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.039
I'm gonna have you leave
your blades on this table

15:06.073 --> 15:08.341
and step into the lounge.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.576
[dramatic music]

15:09.609 --> 15:11.578
- [sigh]
- There they go.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.481
- Later, guys.
- Nah, you're all right, man.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.416
- Ehh...

15:16.449 --> 15:17.985
- All right, gentlemen,

15:18.018 --> 15:19.586
we're gonna start
with Brian's blade.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.354
- There is a lot of work
to do here

15:21.388 --> 15:23.523
to turn this into
a legit dagger.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.459
He's gonna have to really
re-profile this whole thing.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.596
You see how the virtual spine
here is way over on one side?

15:29.629 --> 15:32.665
All that has to be moved over.

15:32.699 --> 15:35.568
- We had a length parameter
of 13 to 15 inches.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.337
- Out comes the tape.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.207
- he's coming in at
about 14 1/2.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.142
- Great.
- So he's got room to

15:42.175 --> 15:43.476
you know, clean up the
shoulders and everything else.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.546
- And let's move on
to Josh's blade.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.582
- He put the chain mail
in one lump on the tang.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.218
Smart place to put it
if you're not trying to

15:51.251 --> 15:53.053
make it pretty.
This makes sure

15:53.086 --> 15:55.288
that none of that mild steel
is on the edge.

15:55.322 --> 15:58.058
Josh's grind is a little
concave here

15:58.091 --> 15:59.559
while at the same time
it's pretty convex

15:59.592 --> 16:01.294
on the other side.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.063
You know, I'd like
to see these lines come in

16:03.096 --> 16:05.398
more towards the center
and become a ridge.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.267
[tense music]

16:07.300 --> 16:09.402
- Plunge grind right there
is 13 1/2.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.771
- Great.
Let's move on to David.

16:11.804 --> 16:16.143
- By far, the closest
to what we were asking for.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.111
This is a classic
dagger shape.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.448
It's wide enough at the bass
to support the chopping.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.017
Honestly, if he fullered
the center of this,

16:24.051 --> 16:25.185
it'd be wicked lookin'.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.753
*

16:26.786 --> 16:29.356
Right at 14 inches.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.425
- So, let's go ahead and take
a look at Richard's dagger.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.794
- It is extremely rough.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.064
I mean, he didn't have much
time to do any grinding,

16:37.097 --> 16:38.431
so this is just knock
some scale off

16:38.465 --> 16:40.367
so you see steel in there.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.336
- Every tool came out of
the box and went into this,

16:43.370 --> 16:45.305
so I gotta give him
props for that.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.706
*

16:46.739 --> 16:49.076
It's very rough,
very unfinished.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.411
*

16:51.444 --> 16:53.480
And very long.
That's...

16:53.513 --> 16:55.482
over 16 inches.

16:55.515 --> 16:58.051
- Over an inch outside
of the parameters.

16:58.085 --> 16:59.586
All right,
let's go tell our smiths.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.454
[tense music]

17:01.488 --> 17:03.523
Bladesmiths,
our deliberation is complete.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.792
It's time for one of you
to leave The Forge.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.796
Richard...

17:09.829 --> 17:13.166
your blade is over
our maximum length parameter,

17:13.200 --> 17:14.801
and therefore
I have to ask you

17:14.834 --> 17:16.703
to surrender your blade
and leave The Forge.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.072
[rock music]

17:19.106 --> 17:20.740
- I think I might have
overdrawn it

17:20.773 --> 17:22.675
within the last
10, 12 minutes maybe.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.611
- Thank you, Richard.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.614
- And what is worse--
being struck by lightning,

17:27.647 --> 17:29.616
or coming in last
on "Forged in Fire"?

17:29.649 --> 17:31.384
Uh,
being struck by lightning.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.752
Obviously.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.455
- Bladesmiths,
congratulations.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.290
You made it
to the second round.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.127
That doesn't mean things
are gonna get easier.

17:40.160 --> 17:43.363
You still have to turn those
blades into fully functional

17:43.396 --> 17:45.765
Knights Templar Crusader
daggers

17:45.798 --> 17:50.237
by adding a cruciform guard
and pommel.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.705
You will have full use
of the pantry in this round,

17:52.739 --> 17:55.742
and you will also have three
hours to work on your blades.

17:55.775 --> 17:57.710
Keep in mind that
at the end of this round,

17:57.744 --> 17:59.712
your blades will be tested
for strength and durability

17:59.746 --> 18:01.714
in a chain mail stab,

18:01.748 --> 18:04.284
and for sharpness
in a fish fillet.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.486
After your weapons have been
tested, one of you

18:06.519 --> 18:09.422
will have to surrender your
blade and leave The Forge.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.525
Grab your steel,
because your time starts now.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.593
[rock music]

18:13.626 --> 18:14.594
- Off to the races.

18:14.627 --> 18:17.330
*

18:17.364 --> 18:19.466
- I've got an hour that I've
got to put into the blade.

18:19.499 --> 18:23.403
I wanna make sure I attack the
points that Dave pointed out

18:23.436 --> 18:25.805
since he is the expert
on this blade.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.475
I have to make
the sides parallel.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.178
I need to refine the thickness
of the blade near the tip.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.614
- It was a little bit
of an obtuse angle at the tip.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.849
By bringing that down
to a more acute angle,

18:36.883 --> 18:38.685
he's gonna get
better penetration,

18:38.718 --> 18:40.620
open up those links
a little bit more,

18:40.653 --> 18:43.423
and if you open up the links,
you get to open up flesh.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.658
- Making it
to the second round

18:45.692 --> 18:47.560
is just an awesome feeling.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.496
My dad didn't make it
this far,

18:49.529 --> 18:51.164
so he's definitely
gonna be rooting for me to win.

18:51.198 --> 18:52.832
The things I need to fix

18:52.865 --> 18:54.867
are the bevel
is a little wavy,

18:54.901 --> 18:56.536
and then the tang was
a little too thick.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.938
My biggest concern
is just the time.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.342
Three hours to get all this
done--it's gonna be difficult.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.712
- Josh's familiarity
with tools worries me.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.614
He's doing
angle grinder work

19:07.647 --> 19:10.550
that he could be doing
on a grinder very quickly.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.253
- Brian's moving right along.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.188
I think he's trying to
establish some straight edges

19:15.222 --> 19:17.590
on that wiggly, squiggly blade.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.627
- I need to straighten out some
of the waviness in the edge

19:20.660 --> 19:23.230
and the fatness in the tip.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.598
- I wanna see him
take a torch to that tang

19:25.632 --> 19:27.534
and straighten it.
He's not gonna

19:27.567 --> 19:28.835
grind that tang so straight.
He's gotta bend it.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.637
- One hour has elapsed!

19:30.670 --> 19:32.339
- I draw my holes
for the guard.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.906
Now I can fit it for the blade.

19:33.940 --> 19:34.674
[bleep]

19:36.376 --> 19:38.278
[groans]
I don't get as tight

19:38.311 --> 19:40.547
of a fit as I want.
I need to make sure

19:40.580 --> 19:42.549
everything holds together.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.384
- David's welding.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.486
The concern with doing
that is you create

19:46.519 --> 19:48.688
extreme heat
in a very small place.

19:48.721 --> 19:51.924
- Does it compromise the
overall structural integrity

19:51.958 --> 19:54.861
of the blade itself though?
- It can.

19:54.894 --> 19:56.829
- For the handle,
I picked a laminate.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.465
It's really strong stuff.

19:58.498 --> 19:59.866
For the crossguard
and the pommel,

19:59.899 --> 20:01.868
I ended up choosing steel.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.970
[bleep, bleep]

20:04.003 --> 20:05.838
This is a defective bit.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.574
- Josh picked
a steel crossguard

20:07.607 --> 20:09.842
which just takes
a lot of time to get fitted

20:09.876 --> 20:12.645
because it just doesn't machine
as easily as the brass.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.880
- Tips are messed up.
They're not going through,

20:13.913 --> 20:16.316
so I'm freaking out a little.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.651
How in the hell am I gonna get
this crossguard finished?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.687
[machine whirring]
- For the handle,

20:20.720 --> 20:23.590
I chose a laminated
synthetic material

20:23.623 --> 20:25.625
that can withstand the abuse

20:25.658 --> 20:27.794
and is a little bit
more reliable.

20:27.827 --> 20:31.664
My biggest concern is coming up
with something artsy-fartsy

20:31.698 --> 20:34.434
to do with my pommel
and crossguard.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.337
- So it looks like Brian's got
brass crossguard, brass pommel.

20:37.370 --> 20:40.540
It's a good choice 'cause it's
the easiest to file and shape.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.775
- I'm ready
to assemble everything.

20:42.809 --> 20:46.379
Just to make sure that things
aren't going to move around,

20:46.413 --> 20:48.481
I put my blade in the vice.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.617
[clink]
both: Oh!

20:50.650 --> 20:51.784
- Oh, my lord.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.420
[dramatic music]

20:53.453 --> 20:54.987
- He just cracked
his blade off.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.890
- The whole blade?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.759
- I hear the ping,

20:59.792 --> 21:03.330
I hear the tinkling
of my blade on the floor

21:03.363 --> 21:05.498
and appreciated the magnitude
of the disaster

21:05.532 --> 21:06.966
which has just befallen me.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.835
- Oh, man.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.003
- I can't come back
from disaster.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.474
[dramatic musical sting]

21:14.507 --> 21:16.843
s blade just snapped.

21:16.876 --> 21:20.012
- This happened because
when I clamped the vice,

21:20.046 --> 21:22.882
it pushes my blade
into the table.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.385
Welding!

21:25.418 --> 21:28.455
There's not any inclination
in my mind to chuck it in.

21:28.488 --> 21:31.023
I clamp my pieces
on the welding table...

21:31.057 --> 21:32.559
- He's gonna
weld it back together.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.394
- It's not optimal,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.629
but I am going to submit
a finished blade,

21:36.663 --> 21:38.931
and nothing's
going to stop me.

21:38.965 --> 21:39.966
- Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.601
- Two hours has elapsed!

21:42.402 --> 21:44.070
- [bleep]

21:44.103 --> 21:46.573
My original plan
was to make a frame handle

21:46.606 --> 21:48.575
using the carbon fiber.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.544
But I already spent
so much time on the guard.

21:51.578 --> 21:54.113
So I only have time
for a through-tang.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.817
So I locate a piece
of brown Micarta.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.819
- David still doesn't
have a pommel on

21:59.852 --> 22:02.021
and he still hasn't
shaped his handle at all.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.123
- Time's going quick.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.359
I have to get the pommel on.

22:06.393 --> 22:08.628
And I really need
to refine the edge.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.764
It has to be sharp enough to
chop the head off that salmon.

22:11.798 --> 22:13.700
I mean, you know,
I live in Alaska,

22:13.733 --> 22:15.568
and if I can't slice fish,

22:15.602 --> 22:17.937
I mean, I've got no right
to being here.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.907
- Since I couldn't find the
right-sized drill bits,

22:20.940 --> 22:22.642
the guard is gonna be loose.

22:22.675 --> 22:24.844
I do not wanna hand the judges

22:24.877 --> 22:26.646
a weapon with
a loose crossguard.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.681
*

22:28.715 --> 22:31.484
- Spot welding that guard
on like that is unnecessary.

22:31.518 --> 22:33.653
Once you get the whole handle
construction done,

22:33.686 --> 22:35.722
it should take care
of that for you.

22:35.755 --> 22:39.091
- My steel is repaired
as best as I can.

22:39.125 --> 22:41.728
I have my handle material
ready to go.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.897
But the clock
is definitely my enemy.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.967
- Brian over here
working away like a madman

22:48.000 --> 22:49.902
to just get the pommel on.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.871
- If I had a prehensile tail
at this point,

22:51.904 --> 22:53.673
I would've been using that too.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.742
- It is amazing
what people can do

22:55.775 --> 22:58.811
with time constraints
and a challenge.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.179
- Ten, nine,

23:00.212 --> 23:03.082
eight, seven,

23:03.115 --> 23:05.952
six, five, four,

23:05.985 --> 23:09.456
three, two, one.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.559
Bladesmiths, drop your tools.
This round is over.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.160
- I have turned in
a finished blade.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.729
It wasn't optimal,
it wasn't pretty,

23:16.763 --> 23:18.498
but it's up to the judges now.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.099
[tense music]

23:20.132 --> 23:21.968
- Bladesmiths,
this is the strength test.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.936
In history, chain mail
was used to defend knights

23:23.970 --> 23:25.805
against blades and swords,

23:25.838 --> 23:28.140
and even today it protects
divers from sharks.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.076
To test the strength and
durability of your daggers,

23:30.109 --> 23:32.879
I am gonna be slashing and
stabbing into this chain mail,

23:32.912 --> 23:35.014
once each, with either side
of your blades.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.716
Remember, it's not what
happens to the chain mail--

23:36.749 --> 23:38.818
it's what happens
to your dagger that counts.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.687
David, you're up. You ready?

23:40.720 --> 23:42.922
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.857
*

23:44.891 --> 23:46.593
- I didn't really have
a lot of time

23:46.626 --> 23:48.561
to get the edge
where I want it to be.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.896
That could be a problem.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.499
*

23:52.532 --> 23:55.468
[rock music]

23:55.502 --> 24:01.440
*

24:05.578 --> 24:09.148
[tense music]

24:09.181 --> 24:12.519
- Well, David, the guard
is sharp at the top.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.087
It did bite into
my left hand as I'm stabbing.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.590
Another two seconds on the
grinder would've fixed that.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.727
There's a little bit of edge
deformation from the chopping,

24:20.760 --> 24:22.595
but the tip held up perfectly.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.163
I don't see
any problems there.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.766
Overall, good work.
- Thank you.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.601
- Josh, how you feeling?

24:28.635 --> 24:30.202
- Pretty good.
- All right. Let's do this.

24:30.236 --> 24:36.175
*

24:38.044 --> 24:40.980
[rock music]

24:41.013 --> 24:46.986
*

24:49.756 --> 24:51.190
[tense music]

24:51.223 --> 24:54.093
Well, Josh,
not a huge fan of the

24:54.126 --> 24:55.828
welding the crossguard on here.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.097
I mean,
it really puts a weak spot

24:58.130 --> 25:00.132
right where you need
the most strength.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.234
There's a little bit
of edge deformation

25:02.268 --> 25:04.904
but overall, it stayed tight.

25:04.937 --> 25:07.306
Nice job.
- Thanks a lot.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.242
- Brian, you ready?
- Absolutely.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.844
*

25:11.878 --> 25:13.680
Given the catastrophic failure

25:13.713 --> 25:15.882
that I experienced,

25:15.915 --> 25:20.052
when Ben picks up my dagger,
I am terrified.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.555
There could be steel flying
across The Forge,

25:22.589 --> 25:24.757
which would never be
a good thing.

25:24.791 --> 25:30.797
[dramatic musical buildup]

25:30.830 --> 25:33.833
- Given the catastrophic
failure that I experienced,

25:33.866 --> 25:38.571
when Ben picks up my dagger,
I am terrified.

25:38.605 --> 25:40.673
*

25:40.707 --> 25:43.643
[rock music]

25:43.676 --> 25:49.616
*

25:52.952 --> 25:56.155
[tense music]

25:56.188 --> 25:59.759
- Well, Brian,
the handle is big.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.628
There's a lot of brass here,
so the whole thing

26:01.661 --> 26:04.030
is really heavy.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.198
There's a little bit of
edge deformation from the cut

26:06.232 --> 26:09.802
right up near the weld,
but otherwise it stayed solid.

26:09.836 --> 26:12.004
Nice job.
- Thank you.

26:12.038 --> 26:14.106
I am relieved.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.709
It did what it was supposed
to with the chain mail.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.310
And if there were
a critical failure,

26:18.344 --> 26:21.714
I'd be wearing a piece
of blade in my chest.

26:21.748 --> 26:24.116
- All right, gentlemen, to test
the sharpness of your edge,

26:24.150 --> 26:25.852
I'll be slicing
into these fish

26:25.885 --> 26:27.987
once with each edge
of your knife.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.756
Brian, you're up first.
You ready?

26:29.789 --> 26:30.790
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

26:30.823 --> 26:35.695
*

26:35.728 --> 26:38.665
[dramatic music]

26:38.698 --> 26:41.233
*

26:41.267 --> 26:43.836
[tense music]

26:43.870 --> 26:47.974
So, Brian, the edge profile
of your blade is pretty stout.

26:48.007 --> 26:49.809
It's sharp up here,

26:49.842 --> 26:52.679
but the section that went
through the chain mail--

26:52.712 --> 26:55.081
most of that edge has
just slightly rolled over.

26:55.114 --> 26:59.919
So it cuts, but it doesn't cut
the way I would like it to cut.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.921
Josh, you're up next.
- I'm ready. Let's do it.

27:01.954 --> 27:05.224
*

27:05.257 --> 27:08.194

27:08.227 --> 27:13.165
*

27:15.201 --> 27:17.403
- Okay, Josh.
Up here,

27:17.436 --> 27:21.073
I can run my fingers right
along the side of this blade.

27:21.107 --> 27:24.877
Your blade has
a very wide convex edge.

27:24.911 --> 27:28.047
You can see with the fish--
it dented it.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.316
As a purely thrusting dagger,
it's very effective.

27:30.349 --> 27:33.385
Uh, as a cutter, not so much.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.221
All right, Dave,
it's your turn. You ready?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.123
- That's why I'm here.
- Okay.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.059
[tense music]

27:40.092 --> 27:43.062
*

27:43.095 --> 27:46.032
[rock music]

27:46.065 --> 27:49.435
*

27:49.468 --> 27:51.270
All right, Dave.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.706
The first cut--beautiful.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.241
On the backside of the blade,

27:55.274 --> 27:57.877
I can feel
a bit of a rolled spot.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.446
But it's a good cutter.
Nicely done.

28:00.479 --> 28:01.914
- Thank you.

28:01.948 --> 28:03.482
- Bladesmiths,

28:03.515 --> 28:05.818
the judges
have made a final decision.

28:05.852 --> 28:08.020
It's time for one of you
to leave The Forge.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.722
*

28:09.756 --> 28:11.123
The bladesmith
leaving The Forge...

28:11.157 --> 28:13.192
*

28:13.225 --> 28:16.462
Is Josh. Your blade
did not make the cut.

28:16.495 --> 28:19.465
- Josh, this was
an extremely close decision,

28:19.498 --> 28:21.233
but in the end it came down

28:21.267 --> 28:23.135
to the fact that
in the sharpness test,

28:23.169 --> 28:24.837
your blade just wasn't
sharp enough to cut.

28:24.871 --> 28:25.938
That's why we're
letting you go.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.506
- Um, yes, I understand.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.778
- Josh, please surrender
your dagger.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.813
- I was definitely
disappointed that my blade

28:33.846 --> 28:35.447
didn't slice all the way
through the fish,

28:35.481 --> 28:37.116
but no regrets.
I had a fun time.

28:37.149 --> 28:38.751
Me and my father, you know,

28:38.785 --> 28:40.286
we went through
the same experience.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.755
Even though
I'm not going through,

28:42.789 --> 28:45.057
I'm sure my dad's gonna be
extremely proud of me.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.492
[dramatic music]

28:46.525 --> 28:48.494
- Brian, David--
congratulations,

28:48.527 --> 28:50.362
you've made it to the final
round of this competition.

28:50.396 --> 28:52.799
Now we're sending you
back to your home forges

28:52.832 --> 28:55.401
where you will recreate
an iconic weapon from history.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.036
That weapon is...

28:59.371 --> 29:03.843
A Knights Templar
Crusader sword.

29:03.876 --> 29:06.312
Regarded as one of history's
most symbolic weapons,

29:06.345 --> 29:08.080
the Crusader's sword
was carried

29:08.114 --> 29:10.149
by the Knights Templar,
an elite order

29:10.182 --> 29:12.218
of Catholic knights who
fought during the Crusades

29:12.251 --> 29:14.020
to defend the Holy Land.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.955
This formidable
double-edged long sword

29:15.988 --> 29:18.424
featured a deep fuller
that reduced its weight

29:18.457 --> 29:20.392
and a heavy pommel
for balance,

29:20.426 --> 29:22.962
making it a highly effective
one-handed weapon.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.264
The blade's long, tapered
point penetrated deeply

29:25.297 --> 29:28.334
into thick enemy armor
while its cross-like guard

29:28.367 --> 29:30.002
a nod to the
Christian crucifix,

29:30.036 --> 29:32.104
blocked blows to the hand.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.440
Today, the sword's religious
history and symbolism

29:34.473 --> 29:37.543
is recounted in popular war
films like "Ironclad"

29:37.576 --> 29:39.378
and the weapon can be seen

29:39.411 --> 29:41.247
in the History series,
"Knightfall."

29:41.280 --> 29:43.315
- I feel that this
is an attainable goal.

29:43.349 --> 29:46.318
I should be able
to incorporate

29:46.352 --> 29:48.821
some of the
historical accuracy.

29:48.855 --> 29:51.223
And some little
Brian-esque touches

29:51.257 --> 29:53.225
that will make it my own.

29:53.259 --> 29:56.395
- It must be strong,
sharp, and light.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.498
The maximum weight
for this blade is 3 pounds.

29:59.531 --> 30:01.533
After five days,
you will return

30:01.567 --> 30:03.369
and present your swords
to our panel of expert judges,

30:03.402 --> 30:05.237
and only after they put them
through a series

30:05.271 --> 30:08.207
of brutal tests
will they declare one of you

30:08.240 --> 30:10.009
the "Forged in Fire" champion.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.978
and hand you that check
for 10 grand.

30:12.011 --> 30:14.613
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448
- Good luck, man.
- Good luck.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.518
[rock music]

30:19.551 --> 30:22.221
- We're in lovely
Juneau, Alaska.

30:22.254 --> 30:25.124
No better place to live in
Alaska. It's just beautiful.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.093
Crusader's sword.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.227
I've never worked
on a sword this large,

30:28.260 --> 30:29.962
but I know that Brian has.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.497
So he has an advantage there.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.531
It's gonna be
a real challenge.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.967
Things are getting hot.

30:35.001 --> 30:38.404
Swor that large have to be
held and wielded with ease.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.339
So you can have a large piece

30:40.372 --> 30:42.341
and it has to be very light
in your hand.

30:42.374 --> 30:44.076
You can't have
a piece so heavy

30:44.110 --> 30:46.245
that it carries you
off of your balance.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.514
Yeah, I like the shape.
It's really nice.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.984
But, uh, I wanna get the bevels
ground in a little bit.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.453
That is about the time
where I take a break

30:54.486 --> 30:56.255
and I go out
and ride my motorcycle

30:56.288 --> 30:57.389
off into the mountains.

30:57.423 --> 30:59.091
[laughs]

30:59.125 --> 31:01.627
*

31:01.660 --> 31:04.630
- What I am really stoked
about in building

31:04.663 --> 31:07.366
the Knights Templar Crusader
sword, is the fact that

31:07.399 --> 31:09.969
it's a Knights Templar
Crusader sword.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.938
It connects with Christianity.

31:11.971 --> 31:14.473
And the religious upbringing
that I had--

31:14.506 --> 31:16.442
it's really going to be
rewarding on a lot of levels.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.911
This is the steel I'm going
to use to make my sword.

31:18.945 --> 31:21.447
The dimensions
that I'm shooting for are

31:21.480 --> 31:24.416
36 inches in length
and at under 3 pounds.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.252
I could cut it
and forge weld it.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.688
I could split it.
I could draw it all out.

31:29.721 --> 31:34.126
But the plan is to
pull the sword out,

31:34.160 --> 31:36.095
sort of like that.

31:36.128 --> 31:38.630
I have never unfolded metal
this way before,

31:38.664 --> 31:41.567
and this is
a big piece of steel.

31:41.600 --> 31:44.003
I think I can work with that.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.238
*

31:46.272 --> 31:48.607
- The main thing with this
sword is to remove weight.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.542
So, uh, we're gonna work
on weight reduction

31:50.576 --> 31:53.479
and get the fuller in there.

31:53.512 --> 31:56.983
Just a quick, dirty fuller
ground in there, man.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.985
I have to start thinking
about my heat treat too.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.020
Gonna have to hook
a burner up to this forge.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.355
People up in Alaska--
more so than many--

32:03.389 --> 32:05.491
we make it out of our
own tools and equipment.

32:05.524 --> 32:08.260
But really,
don't do this at home.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.462
It's good to take your time,
make sure that you have

32:10.496 --> 32:12.264
all the clearance
that you need

32:12.298 --> 32:13.465
and that you can get
the piece into the tank.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.367
I don't wanna rush anything.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.136
Main thing is getting
a good heat treatment.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.105
The abuse that they're
gonna put this through...

32:19.138 --> 32:21.473
you could have a disaster
going into the quench.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.509
I mean, it could
come out all twisted.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.244
We'll just hope that
that doesn't happen.

32:25.277 --> 32:28.514
[dramatic music]

32:28.547 --> 32:32.051
*

32:32.084 --> 32:34.453
So far, it looks good.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.188
And it's hard.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.690
So we got a successful
heat treat.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.492
I'm happy.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.994
It's now a live blade.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.595
It just has to be finished up.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.764
Almost see the light
at the end of the tunnel.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.699
[upbeat rock music]

32:47.733 --> 32:49.435
- [straining] Ah, we got
some straightening to do.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.137
It's the beginning
of day three.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.039
I've got the profile
established.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.106
There's a little bit
of beef here and there

32:54.140 --> 32:55.641
that needs to come off.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.609
[tools whirring]
Looking good.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.546
I'm feeling really good
about my blade at this point.

33:00.579 --> 33:02.781
It's to contour,
the fullers are cut.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.084
There's only one thing that
I haven't done with my sword,

33:05.117 --> 33:07.786
and that's weigh it.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.356
Ooh, we are over 3 pounds

33:10.389 --> 33:11.790
just with the blade.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.792
Anything more than
3 pounds

33:13.825 --> 33:15.794
places me at risk
for elimination.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.796
By the time I add a pommel...

33:17.829 --> 33:20.299
[dramatic music]

33:20.332 --> 33:22.568
5.5.
[sighs]

33:22.601 --> 33:27.073
[bleep]

33:27.106 --> 33:29.075
- This wood that
I'm using right here

33:29.108 --> 33:31.410
is Alaskan yellow cedar.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.512
Really nice wood for handles.
I like it. It's really light.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.614
Now I've gotta make the pommel.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.449
You've got
a long blade out there.

33:37.483 --> 33:39.185
You need something
to counterbalance that.

33:39.218 --> 33:41.320
That's what I was looking for.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.223
Nice piece of wrought iron
over a hundred years old.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.458
Just the right diameter
for the pommel.

33:46.492 --> 33:49.261
That's gonna add weight to the
back and give it some balance.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.829
*

33:50.862 --> 33:52.698
I can't wait
to see how it feels.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.333
Right now...phew!

33:54.366 --> 33:55.501
Oh, yeah.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.703
It went very well.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.172
Look at the smile.
[laughs]

34:00.206 --> 34:02.441
Having my
celebratory ice cream.

34:02.474 --> 34:05.144
My ice cream cozy.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.746
Tomorrow I just expect to put
the final round on the blade,

34:07.779 --> 34:09.648
and we'll be ready
to do some testing.

34:09.681 --> 34:12.451
*

34:12.484 --> 34:14.286
- My blade is almost done.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.255
I drilled my pommel.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.157
I've drilled around
the edge of the pommel.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.392
Ground a little bit
on my crossguard.

34:20.426 --> 34:23.495
I've got my mass down
to around 3 pounds.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.132
But I don't have a quench
on my blade yet.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.100
That has to happen today.

34:28.134 --> 34:29.501
This is holy water from

34:29.535 --> 34:32.271
Chalice Well
in Glastonbury, UK.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.340
This is where
Joseph of Arimathea

34:34.373 --> 34:36.208
allegedly hid
the Holy Grail.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.310
*

34:38.344 --> 34:40.412
Not much.
Enough to, uh...

34:40.446 --> 34:43.449
enough to bless
the piece though.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.318
I'm ready to go and I'm scared
out of my mind, man.

34:46.352 --> 34:49.188
This is a long blade, and
if it goes down the toilet,

34:49.221 --> 34:50.189
I will be gutted.

34:50.222 --> 34:56.595
*

34:56.628 --> 34:58.397
I think we have a blade.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.566
Booyah.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.568
The blade is essentially
done at this point,

35:02.601 --> 35:04.670
so it's time to move on
to the pretty parts--

35:04.703 --> 35:06.438
the gewgaws,
as I call them.

35:06.472 --> 35:09.708
In-lays from holy trees
to the handle,

35:09.741 --> 35:12.144
red garnets into
the base of the pommel.

35:12.178 --> 35:14.646
This will symbolize
Christ's blood.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.515
There are, for real,
religious artifacts

35:16.548 --> 35:18.284
included with this piece.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.452
Not to mention
my own love for it.

35:20.486 --> 35:23.289
Feel like I wanna
slash at something.

35:23.322 --> 35:26.392
[dramatic music]

35:26.425 --> 35:29.195
- Brian. David.
Welcome back to The Forge.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.662
You've had five days
at your home forges

35:30.696 --> 35:32.664
to work on your Templar swords.

35:32.698 --> 35:34.600
Brian, how'd it go for you?

35:34.633 --> 35:36.868
- The five days went
unbelievably quickly.

35:36.902 --> 35:39.271
The blade itself
is partially quenched

35:39.305 --> 35:41.373
in water from Chalice Well,

35:41.407 --> 35:43.742
where Joseph of Arimathea
hid the Holy Grail,

35:43.775 --> 35:46.845
and it is inlaid
with 2,000-year-old oak

35:46.878 --> 35:50.182
from Glastonbury Tor,
very holy trees.

35:50.216 --> 35:51.450
- Wow. Well done.
- Thank you.

35:51.483 --> 35:53.552
- David, can you compete?

35:53.585 --> 35:55.321
- I don't know after all that.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.722
I used wrought iron
for my fittings.

35:56.755 --> 35:58.524
Uh, these came from
a Treadwell mine

35:58.557 --> 35:59.825
in Juneau
over a hundred years old.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.893
Leather handle.
That's it.

36:01.927 --> 36:03.795
- Now it's time to see how
they hold up in our tests.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.265
Doug?

36:06.298 --> 36:08.500
- This is the kill test.

36:08.534 --> 36:11.470
A Knights Templar sword--
an iconic weapon

36:11.503 --> 36:13.505
battle-tested
throughout history.

36:13.539 --> 36:16.208
To see what kind of lethal
damage your weapon will do,

36:16.242 --> 36:17.609
we'll take your sword
and deliver killing blows

36:17.643 --> 36:19.578
on this ballistics dummy.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.380
Brian, you're up first.

36:21.413 --> 36:24.516
- Going into testing,
I'm wondering

36:24.550 --> 36:26.718
if I spent enough time
on the grind.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.820
I know that
the quench was good.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.690
So there will be blood.
I'm quite certain of that.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.859
- I would love to test
your blade, but as you can see

36:33.892 --> 36:35.261
I'm still recovering
from an injury.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.828
So, to be my arm today,

36:36.862 --> 36:38.897
please welcome RJ Marcaida,
my brother.

36:38.930 --> 36:42.601
He will have the pleasure
of wielding your weapons.

36:44.903 --> 36:46.638
[dramatic music]

36:46.672 --> 36:47.606
- [grunts]

36:47.639 --> 36:53.579
*

36:55.647 --> 36:56.915
- [whispers]
That's awesome.

36:56.948 --> 37:00.986
[tense music]

37:01.019 --> 37:03.655
- Your sword is a little bit
on the heavier side.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.392
But because of the pommel
you have over here,

37:06.425 --> 37:08.494
it actually balances it out.

37:08.527 --> 37:10.529
There are areas that are sharp,

37:10.562 --> 37:13.465
and there are areas
that are not as sharp.

37:13.499 --> 37:16.802
On the final blow, that edge
has proven to be very sharp

37:16.835 --> 37:19.838
and actually would disembowel
this ballistics dummy.

37:19.871 --> 37:23.609
Your sword, sir, will kill.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.010
All right, David, it's your
turn. You ready?

37:25.043 --> 37:26.945
- Let's do it.
- Let's do this.

37:26.978 --> 37:30.782
- Brian's blade--
it cut, it slashed, it stabbed.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.551
We got some
competition here today.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.787
Just can't wait
to see how mine goes.

37:35.821 --> 37:38.757
[dramatic music]

37:38.790 --> 37:44.730
*

37:47.733 --> 37:49.468
- [chuckling]

37:49.501 --> 37:50.869
[tense music]

37:50.902 --> 37:52.037
- Good job.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.905
*

37:53.939 --> 37:56.074
- [chuckling]

37:56.107 --> 37:58.377
- That is one of the sharpest
swords I've ever come across.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.412
It's wicked scary.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.814
The cut lacerated
almost in half.

38:02.848 --> 38:05.351
Without a doubt,
your weapon will kill.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.654
- Awesome.
- Ben?

38:08.687 --> 38:09.955
- Gentlemen,
to test the strength

38:09.988 --> 38:11.757
and durability
of your edges,

38:11.790 --> 38:13.459
I'm gonna attack these
fully-armored knights.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.860
Remember, this test
is all about

38:14.893 --> 38:16.462
what the armor does
to your sword,

38:16.495 --> 38:17.863
not what your sword does
to the armor.

38:17.896 --> 38:18.797
Brian, you're up first.
You ready?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.031
- Absolutely.

38:20.065 --> 38:23.001
[dramatic music]

38:23.034 --> 38:28.974
*

38:34.513 --> 38:36.548
- [whispers]
Looks good.

38:36.582 --> 38:39.351
- Well, Brian, your edge
held up really well.

38:39.385 --> 38:41.420
It's a very obtuse grind.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.655
It lends itself
to this kind of test.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.591
The handle was comfortable.
It's a nice shape.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.526
I was able to index very well.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.727
It stayed straight
in the test

38:48.760 --> 38:51.597
and didn't pick up any damage.

38:51.630 --> 38:52.964
Well done.
- Thank you.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.700
- David, you're up next.

38:57.836 --> 39:00.772
[dramatic music]

39:00.806 --> 39:06.745
*

39:09.648 --> 39:13.819
Well, Dave, you have a much
finer edge on this sword,

39:13.852 --> 39:15.754
and it's picked up
a little bit of rolling.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.391
You can hear it.
edge defl[tapping]ght here.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.859
But all in all,
very good sword.

39:20.892 --> 39:22.628
- Thank you.

39:22.661 --> 39:24.029
- So, next up
is the sharpness test.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.164
And for that,
I'll give you to Dave.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.900
- All right, gentlemen, next
up--the swinging sandbag slice.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.637
I will cut this rope
with one edge of your blade,

39:31.670 --> 39:33.939
releasing that sandbag,
and then cutting that

39:33.972 --> 39:35.641
with the other edge
of your blade.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.042
Let's see if they
still have an edge.

39:37.075 --> 39:39.545
Brian, you're up. You ready?

39:39.578 --> 39:42.781
- I am more than
a little bit nervous

39:42.814 --> 39:45.050
because Dave's weapon
is clearly a slicer,

39:45.083 --> 39:49.755
and parts of my blade
were not as sharp as others.

39:49.788 --> 39:57.829
*

39:57.863 --> 40:00.031
if they can get it
into that sweet spot

40:00.065 --> 40:01.600
that I built into the blade.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.502
Otherwise, I'm done.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.070
[dramatic music]

40:05.103 --> 40:08.073
[rock music]

40:08.106 --> 40:14.012
*

40:19.918 --> 40:22.788
[tense music]

40:22.821 --> 40:27.092
- First off, there are sections
of this blade that just

40:27.125 --> 40:29.127
don't have much of an ed.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.863
That first cut
just skated up the rope.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.999
Second cut bit in.
Went right through.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.668
You can see how there's
a lot of tearing

40:36.702 --> 40:38.737
at the edge of that bag,

40:38.770 --> 40:41.640
as opposed to
a clean slice through it.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.975
I would have loved to have seen
a little bit more edge

40:44.009 --> 40:45.644
especially on that front half.

40:45.677 --> 40:46.812
*

40:46.845 --> 40:48.046
David, you ready?

40:48.079 --> 40:49.180
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

40:52.250 --> 40:55.186
[dramatic music]

40:55.220 --> 41:00.191
*

41:00.225 --> 41:01.927
- Phew.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.662
- Your sword's sharp.
Very sharp.

41:03.695 --> 41:05.731
Passed through
the rope no problem.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.165
Passed through
the bag no problem.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.668
As far as the design
of your sword--

41:09.701 --> 41:11.803
would've loved to have seen
a counterbalance on this.

41:11.837 --> 41:14.039
Uh...
this would be nice on a dagger.

41:14.072 --> 41:16.241
It's very small for this sword.

41:16.274 --> 41:18.009
Without that counterbalance,

41:18.043 --> 41:20.679
all that weight
is so far forward.

41:20.712 --> 41:22.614
But it's a cutter.
It's definitely sharp.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.249
Nicely done.
- Thank you.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.953
- Bladesmiths, the judges have
completed their deliberation

41:27.986 --> 41:29.855
and they've made
a final decision.

41:29.888 --> 41:32.223
You've both put in
a lot of work here,

41:32.257 --> 41:35.026
but there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion

41:35.060 --> 41:36.828
and that champion is...

41:36.862 --> 41:38.597
[dramatic music]

41:38.630 --> 41:40.666
Dave, congratulations,

41:40.699 --> 41:42.801
you are the
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.203
Brian, unfortunately,

41:45.236 --> 41:48.607
your Crusader sword
did not make the cut.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.842
- Brian, I really applaud
the fact that you brought

41:50.876 --> 41:52.210
a lot of yourself
to that sword.

41:52.243 --> 41:54.245
In the end, it came down to

41:54.279 --> 41:56.915
your sword just wasn't as sharp
as your competitor's.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.149
That's why
we've gotta let you go.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.918
- Understood.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.787
- Brian, please
surrender your sword.

42:01.820 --> 42:03.722
[dramatic music]

42:03.755 --> 42:05.624
- David's sword
cut better than mine.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.126
He outsmithed me.
That's the way it goes, man.

42:08.159 --> 42:10.028
In the end,
there can be only one.

42:10.061 --> 42:13.098
I may make another Knights
Templar Crusader sword.

42:13.131 --> 42:16.267
I've still got 2,000-year-old
oak bits at home.

42:16.301 --> 42:18.837
I still have
holy water at home.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.338
Anything can happen.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.873
*

42:21.907 --> 42:23.642
- David, congratulations,

42:23.675 --> 42:25.644
you are the
"Forged in Fire" champion,

42:25.677 --> 42:27.646
and that's a title that comes
with a check for how much?

42:27.679 --> 42:28.747
- 10 grand.
- That's right.

42:28.780 --> 42:30.148
$10,000. Good job.

42:30.181 --> 42:31.650
[applause]

42:31.683 --> 42:33.151
- Victory feels good.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.986
This competition
showed me that I

42:35.020 --> 42:37.188
can push myself
a little harder

42:37.222 --> 42:38.990
to get more done.

42:39.024 --> 42:40.726
Looking forward
to getting back home.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.227
First thing I'm gonna do
is fix my bike

42:42.260 --> 42:43.228
and go for a ride.

42:43.261 --> 42:46.197
[dramatic music]

42:46.231 --> 42:49.768
*
