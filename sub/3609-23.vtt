[narrator] Previously on Lost:

00:03.796 --> 00:06.913
No matter what happens here
I want you to keep moving.

00:09.260 --> 00:12.468
We caught three of them, the ones
who stayed to blow up the tents.

00:12.555 --> 00:15.843
Once the rock star turns off
whatever's jamming us up,

00:15.933 --> 00:17.184
you need to call my boat.

00:17.268 --> 00:20.260
[Desmond] A room full of equipment.
There's a blinking yellow light.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.687
You flip the switch.
The light goes off. And you drown.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.436
If you don't, there won't be any rescue.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.688
. - [gunfire]
- [inhales deeply]

00:30.907 --> 00:33.694
Des! Hide, Des, there's people in there!

00:33.784 --> 00:37.447
Mikhail, I need you to help me
clean up this mess that I've made.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.120
I need you to kill Charlie.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.206
[J‘ Nirvana: Scent/ess Apprentice]

01:01.062 --> 01:04.179
- What's up?
- What's going on?

01:10.821 --> 01:14.109
[dial tones]

01:15.326 --> 01:17.237
[ringing]

01:17.328 --> 01:21.492
[woman] You have reached
310-555-0. . .

01:44.522 --> 01:45.728
[tires screech]

01:45.815 --> 01:48.522
[honking horn]

02:04.333 --> 02:05.368
[door opens]

02:08.879 --> 02:11.621
- Can I help you?
- Sorry, I...

02:14.593 --> 02:17.084
Actually, I came...

02:19.473 --> 02:21.134
Is the funeral over?

02:21.225 --> 02:25.639
There was no funeral, sir.
Only a viewing. Nobody showed up.

02:27.648 --> 02:31.266
- Nobody? You sure?
- Just you.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.194
My deepest condolences.
Friend or family?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.566
Neither.

02:40.661 --> 02:45.951
- Would you like me to open it up?
- No. No.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.499
Take your time.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.617
[whispering] Damn it.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.296
Danielle.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.793
- How much further?
- About an hour.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.548
The radio tower.
When was the last time you were there?

03:45.643 --> 03:48.134
The day I recorded the message.

03:49.438 --> 03:53.226
I'll take you to the tower,
but I'm not leaving the island.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.059
- What?
- There's no place for me back there.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.439
This is my home now.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.091
Hello, Jack.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.795
We need to talk.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.298
- What did Ben say?
- Can we kill him?

04:58.382 --> 05:00.543
Is it possible
to turn this equipment off?

05:01.719 --> 05:02.754
What?

05:02.845 --> 05:05.131
The jamming equipment,
can you turn it off?

05:05.222 --> 05:08.965
- Sure. Ben gave us the code.
- You are the only ones who have it?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.799
Yeah. Why?

05:10.895 --> 05:14.479
What would happen
if the station were to be flooded?

05:14.565 --> 05:16.931
The casing for the equipment
is waterproof.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.482
lt'll keep going forever.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.436
- Then why do you need to be here?
- Because Ben told us to.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.987
- We were following orders.
- You never asked why?

05:24.074 --> 05:28.158
No. Because I trust him.
And I trust Jacob.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.327
The minute I start questioning orders,

05:30.414 --> 05:34.828
this whole thing, everything that
we're doing here falls apart.

05:37.046 --> 05:38.877
She makes an excellent point.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.511
[girl groans]

06:00.027 --> 06:03.144
No. Please.

06:03.239 --> 06:06.231
I'm sorry, Bonnie.
I, too, am following orders.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.612
Hey!

06:17.795 --> 06:22.289
No, Des. Des! Don't! We need her.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.231
l'm Benjamin.
We haven't had the pleasure.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.157
Don't talk to him.

06:53.539 --> 06:56.155
- What do you want?
- Just a moment of your time.

06:57.459 --> 07:01.748
- To talk. You and me. Alone.
- For what?

07:01.839 --> 07:04.251
Jack, you've just killed
seven of my people.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.832
The least you can give me
is five minutes.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.428
He alone?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.007
There's only two sets of tracks.
His and hers.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.517
Five minutes.

07:44.048 --> 07:47.381
I'm sorry, there are no more
refills left on this prescription.

07:51.555 --> 07:55.548
Well, that's a mistake.
I only refilled it twice.

07:55.643 --> 07:59.101
- Could you check again?
- I did check it again, Dr. Shephard.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.271
And that was the third refill,
so there's nothing I can do.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.142
I've got another prescription
right here.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.400
Hey. I know you. You're the hero.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.278
- I'm not a hero.
- Yeah. We saw it on TV.

08:13.369 --> 08:16.327
Hey, lady, just give this guy
whatever he needs.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.326
- Do you know what he did?
- Here it is. Here. Oxycodone.

08:20.417 --> 08:22.829
You can't write a prescription
for yourself.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.002
That's Dr. Christian Shephard.

08:25.089 --> 08:27.171
I'm Dr. Jack Shephard.
He's my father.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.873
- I'll call his office.
- He's out of town right now.

08:29.968 --> 08:32.254
Well, I'm sure somebody in the office...

08:33.263 --> 08:35.424
Don't bother.

08:50.364 --> 08:51.900
Have a seat.

08:59.832 --> 09:03.199
Not so long ago, Jack,
I made a decision

09:03.293 --> 09:07.286
that took the lives
of over 40 people in a single day.

09:10.342 --> 09:15.052
I'm telling you this because
history is about to repeat itself.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.676
- Right here. Right now.
- Let me guess.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.225
You've got us surrounded
and if I don't do what you say,

09:21.311 --> 09:25.850
- you're gonna kill all my people.
- No, Jack, you are.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.191
- How am I gonna do that, Ben?
- The woman you're traveling with.

09:33.282 --> 09:36.365
The one who parachuted onto the island
from a helicopter.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.579
She's not who she says she is.

09:41.165 --> 09:43.497
- She's not?
- No. She's not.

09:44.835 --> 09:45.915
Then who is she?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.085
She's a representative of some people

09:48.172 --> 09:51.209
who have been trying
to find this island, Jack.

09:52.301 --> 09:55.043
She's one of the bad guys.

09:55.137 --> 09:57.594
Oh, I almost forgot.

09:57.681 --> 10:00.718
You're the... you're the good guys.

10:00.809 --> 10:04.097
Jack, listen to me.
If you phone her boat,

10:04.188 --> 10:08.682
every single living person
on this island will be killed.

10:13.030 --> 10:16.443
So here's what has to happen.
Get that device.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.197
The phone she carries with her
and give it to me.

10:21.288 --> 10:24.746
I will turn around
and will go back to my people.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.449
You will turn around
and go back to your people.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.001
I'm not going anywhere.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.096
- May l have my walkie back?
- What?

10:42.184 --> 10:45.176
There's something you need to hear.
Please.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.361
Thank you.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.905
[walkie-talkie beeps]

10:59.660 --> 11:01.241
Tom? Are you there?

11:03.080 --> 11:05.321
[Tom] Yeah. I’m here.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.955
Your plan killed seven of my people,

11:08.043 --> 11:11.501
but the ones that you failed to kill
are now holding your friends,

11:11.588 --> 11:14.170
Jin, Sayid, Bernard, at gunpoint.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.624
[Sayid] Jack, don't give him any...

11:16.718 --> 11:19.334
- [Bernard] Leave him alone!
- [Pryce] / said shut up!

11:20.931 --> 11:24.173
And what's to stop me
from snapping your neck?

11:24.268 --> 11:27.977
Tom, unless you hear my voice
in one minute, shoot all three of them.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.178
[ Tom] Got it.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.806
[Pryce] / said don't move.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.438
[shouting on walkie-talkie]

11:35.529 --> 11:39.317
- Bring me the phone, Jack.
- [Sayid] Don't negotiate with him.

11:39.950 --> 11:43.238
- [Pryce] Gag them.
- [Sayid] No.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.159
- Forty seconds.
- No.

11:45.247 --> 11:47.829
I'm getting them all off the island.
All of them.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.658
Let me ask you,
why do you want to leave the island?

11:50.752 --> 11:54.119
What is it that you so desperately
want to get back to?

11:54.631 --> 11:56.747
You have no one.
Your father's dead.

11:56.842 --> 11:59.458
Your wife left you,
moved on with another man.

12:00.053 --> 12:04.717
Can you just not wait to get back to
the hospital? Get back to fixing things?

12:04.808 --> 12:09.393
It's 20 seconds now.
Just get me the phone, Jack.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.391
- No.
- Ten seconds. Bring me the phone.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.689
- I'm not bluffing.
- I won't do it!

12:14.776 --> 12:17.062
- Five. Four. Three.
- No.

12:17.154 --> 12:20.442
- [three gunshots]
- [shouting]

12:28.290 --> 12:30.326
I'm so sorry, Jack.

13:01.490 --> 13:04.948
[breathing heavy] Tom, you there?

13:05.035 --> 13:07.447
Yeah, Jack. I hear you.

13:07.537 --> 13:11.075
I'm going to lead my people
up to the radio tower

13:11.917 --> 13:15.785
and I'm going to make a call.
And I'm going to get them all rescued.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.380
Every one of them.

13:18.548 --> 13:23.212
And then I'm gonna come find you.
And I'm gonna kill you.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.304
[woman coughing, gasping]

13:35.190 --> 13:36.930
- What's the code?
- Go away.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.311
Let's get this over with.
What's the code?

13:39.403 --> 13:41.769
- She's not gonna tell you.
- Yeah, she will.

13:41.863 --> 13:42.989
Why do you say that?

13:43.073 --> 13:45.155
It's my destiny to turn off that jammer.

13:45.242 --> 13:48.200
OK, Bonnie. We're both
gonna die down here, all right?

13:48.286 --> 13:49.992
Let's be perfectly honest,

13:50.080 --> 13:53.322
one-eyed maniac killed your friend
and shot you in the back.

13:53.417 --> 13:57.251
It would appear that your
glorious leader, Ben, put him up to it.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.245
Are you a sodding idiot?

14:01.091 --> 14:05.334
You have the opportunity
to make Ben very, very angry.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.886
Why would you not take that?

14:13.520 --> 14:15.761
- Five, four, five.
- What?

14:15.856 --> 14:18.438
- Eight, seven, seven...
- Is that a code?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.688
- five, five, four, three, seven, six...
- Wait. Start again.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.611
Start from the beginning.
Bonnie, from the beginning.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.861
Bonnie, start again. Bonnie.
Bonnie. Wake up. Wake up.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.738
- Start again. Start again.
- Good Vibrations.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.032
What?

14:33.123 --> 14:36.536
Beach Boys. Good Vibrations.

14:39.296 --> 14:44.381
On the keypad. Numbers, they're notes.

14:48.638 --> 14:51.015
It was programmed by a musician.

15:16.541 --> 15:19.783
Tie him up. He's coming with us.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.680
What?

15:45.529 --> 15:47.110
Alex...

15:49.783 --> 15:51.148
...this is your mother.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.979
Will you help me tie him up?

16:42.544 --> 16:44.205
What happened? What'd he say?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.788
It's not important.
Just get everyone together.

16:47.883 --> 16:50.169
Jack, your knuckles.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.767
What happened?

17:07.235 --> 17:08.771
He killed them.

17:11.615 --> 17:15.278
Bernard, Jin, Sayid.
All three of them.

17:17.954 --> 17:21.947
He radioed the beach.
And I let it happen.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.171
I had to let it happen.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.876
We can't tell Rose or Sun. Not yet.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.551
We've got to keep moving.

17:35.639 --> 17:39.131
I promised Sayid that
we would keep moving.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.433
So why did you bring him back?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.851
Why didn't you just kill him?

17:46.942 --> 17:49.399
Because I want him to see it,

17:51.279 --> 17:54.191
to experience the moment
that we get off this island.

17:54.282 --> 17:58.776
And I want him to know that he failed.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.245
And then I'll kill him.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.710
It was an order, Tom.
We had to follow it.

18:12.801 --> 18:16.293
Ben doesn't know what the hell
he's talking about. He's lost it!

18:16.388 --> 18:18.424
I mean, look at what they did to us!

18:18.515 --> 18:22.975
Instead of putting three bullets in the
sand, we should've killed them for real!

18:34.239 --> 18:36.696
All they got left
is three guys and four guns.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.525
And all we've got, James,
are two people and no guns.

18:41.329 --> 18:42.444
We'll wait till night.

18:42.539 --> 18:44.871
Night won't change
the fact we're unarmed.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.916
If you want to kill yourself, fine,
but before you go...

18:48.003 --> 18:49.209
Shh.

18:51.464 --> 18:52.624
You hear that?

18:52.716 --> 18:54.672
[rustling]

19:07.397 --> 19:08.853
[groan]

19:11.151 --> 19:12.357
Ryan!

19:20.493 --> 19:21.903
Stay in the bus, Hugo.

19:48.271 --> 19:49.260
[groans]

19:50.398 --> 19:51.604
[cocks gun]

19:52.442 --> 19:54.273
Stay right there, Tom.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.614
OK. I give up.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.838
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.587
Dude, it was over. He surrendered.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.971
I didn't believe him.

21:01.970 --> 21:05.087
[woman speaking over PA]

21:10.687 --> 21:12.928
What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.762
l was just, uh...

21:14.858 --> 21:17.144
l was just checking the...

21:17.777 --> 21:19.438
The Arlen charts.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.941
I wanted to see how the operation went.

21:22.031 --> 21:25.694
I left three messages
on your voicemail. You didn't get them?

21:26.369 --> 21:28.075
My phone's broken.

21:31.374 --> 21:32.989
Let's go to my office, Jack.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.207
For what?

21:35.295 --> 21:37.832
We need to have a talk. Come on.

21:39.757 --> 21:43.375
I know that you're new around here,
so you don't know much about me.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.382
I know enough.
So let's just walk down to my office...

21:46.473 --> 21:50.307
If you've got something to say to me,
you can say it to me right here.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.189
Will you excuse us, please?

22:00.236 --> 22:04.149
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,
woke up in recovery about two hours ago.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.855
She was in some pain,

22:05.950 --> 22:09.738
but highly responsive
to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.996
Well, that's... That's great.

22:14.083 --> 22:18.417
But then she described the series
of events that caused her accident.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.216
She says she was driving over the bridge

22:22.300 --> 22:26.794
when she saw a man standing on top
of the railing, about to jump off.

22:29.098 --> 22:32.386
She was distracted
and lost control of her car.

22:32.477 --> 22:37.016
She ran into the median, rolled over
and was hit by the van behind her.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.733
So the obvious question here, Jack,

22:43.279 --> 22:45.816
is how did you
get to that flaming car so fast?

22:45.907 --> 22:49.274
What were you doing on that bridge?

22:57.168 --> 23:00.126
Do you know how many years
I've worked at this hospital?

23:00.964 --> 23:04.627
Do you know anything about me?

23:06.135 --> 23:10.549
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

23:11.015 --> 23:13.802
How much have you had
to drink today, Jack?

23:14.686 --> 23:17.052
OK, I'll tell you what. You do this.

23:20.984 --> 23:23.976
And if I'm drunker than he is,
you can fire me.

23:26.406 --> 23:30.740
Don't you look at me like that.
Don't you pity me.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.318
- I'm trying to help you.
- You can't help me!

24:05.194 --> 24:08.027
[Hurley] Attention, Others!
Come in, Others!

24:08.823 --> 24:12.611
If you’re listening to this, / want
you to know that we got you bastards.

24:12.702 --> 24:15.569
And unless the rest of you
want to be blown up,

24:15.663 --> 24:18.450
you best stay away from our beach.

24:18.541 --> 24:21.374
- Hurley?
- Jack?

24:22.211 --> 24:25.544
- Where are you? What’s going on?
- Dude. I'm back at the beach.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.122
What?

24:27.216 --> 24:29.468
Yeah, lwent back
to help Juliet and Sawyer.

24:29.552 --> 24:31.053
I saved them.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.591
- They're OK? Juliet...
- Everyone's fine.

24:34.682 --> 24:39.802
Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.636
- We're all...
- Wait.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.941
Bernard and Jin and Sayid,
they're with you?

24:47.028 --> 24:49.440
Yeah, dude. I told you.
I saved them all.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.613
[cheering]

25:02.877 --> 25:05.539
Stay where you are,
we're almost up to the tower.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.495
- You’ll be safer there.
- I got you.

25:07.590 --> 25:10.423
We'll stay put until you, like,
you know, phone home.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.008
What about Charlie?
Did he make it back yet?

25:16.099 --> 25:19.683
Not yet, but they're probably
paddling home as we speak.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.600
Don't worry, I'm sure he's fine.

25:33.366 --> 25:36.403
Des, there's diving gear
on those racks, yeah?

25:37.286 --> 25:39.413
- Aye. There's plenty.
- Take care of that.

25:39.497 --> 25:42.955
- l'll tap out Good Vibrations.
- All right, mate.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.703
- Hey, Desmond?
- Aye.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.534
You get any flashes?

25:48.464 --> 25:49.920
No. Nothing.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.709
- Meet you back here then.
- Aye.

26:20.997 --> 26:24.330

26:42.852 --> 26:45.844

26:47.398 --> 26:49.059
So much for fate.

27:06.334 --> 27:08.666
Hello? Can you hear me?

27:09.378 --> 27:13.212

- Who is this? Who am I speaking to?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.381
Charlie. Charlie Pace.

27:15.468 --> 27:19.962
I'm a survivor of flight 815.
Oceanic flight 815.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.796
Where are you?

27:21.891 --> 27:23.756
We're on an island. We're alive.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.967
An island? Where?
What’s your location?

27:26.062 --> 27:31.273
- I don't know. Who's this?
- This is Penelope. Penelope Widmore.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.725

Desmond!

27:38.699 --> 27:42.487
- Did you just say "Desmond"?
- Yeah! He's here. He's with me.

27:42.578 --> 27:44.830
- Is he OK?
- He's brilliant.

27:44.914 --> 27:47.405
- Hey, are you on the boat?
- What boat?

27:47.500 --> 27:52.335
Your boat. Eighty miles offshore.
Naomi parachuted.

27:52.421 --> 27:55.458
I’m not on a boat. Who’s Naomi?

28:11.357 --> 28:15.020
- Hello? Is Desmond there?
- [pounding]

28:15.111 --> 28:18.524
Desmond, can you hear me? Desmond!

28:27.874 --> 28:30.707

28:30.793 --> 28:31.999

29:53.209 --> 29:56.326
[no audio]

30:37.420 --> 30:41.004
- Shh. Really, it's OK, sweetie.
- What's the matter?

30:41.924 --> 30:44.586
I don't know.
I think he's just a bit scared.

30:44.677 --> 30:47.089
- Hard to blame him.
- [electrical bleeping]

30:49.640 --> 30:52.177
- What is it?
- What's your boyfriend's name?

30:52.268 --> 30:54.930
- The rock star?
- Charlie. Why?

30:55.021 --> 30:57.103
[beeping]

30:58.274 --> 30:59.889
Charlie just got us rescued.

31:05.156 --> 31:09.741
Jack! Jack, he did it!
Your friend bloody well did it!

31:09.827 --> 31:11.863
- What?
- The green light. It's on!

31:11.954 --> 31:14.115
- The jamming's stopped!
- Use it then.

31:14.790 --> 31:16.576
All right.

[Rousseau speaking French]

31:24.133 --> 31:26.374
What's this?

31:26.469 --> 31:29.302
lt's Rousseau's message,
still blocking the signal.

It doesn't matter. We're here.

32:30.699 --> 32:33.361
Three days before you were born.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.702
I guess we don't need it anymore.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.006
All right. Do it.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.674
I can't get a signal in here.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.905
I'm getting something.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.699
It's gonna work. It's happening.
We're gonna get off of this island.

Jack. I know you think
you're saving your people.

33:32.219 --> 33:35.757
But you need to stop this.
It's a mistake.

33:35.848 --> 33:39.636
- The mistake was listening to you.
- This will be your last chance, Jack.

33:39.727 --> 33:43.766
I'm telling you, making that call
is the beginning of the end.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.347
- [beep]
- I've got it! I've got a signal!

33:47.401 --> 33:49.266
