&gt;&gt; LULU, WHAT'S IN THAT THING?

00:14.381 --> 00:15.115
&gt;&gt; NOT MUCH.

&gt;&gt; I'VE SEEN HIM

00:26.326 --> 00:26.960
EAT A NEWSPAPER,

00:27.026 --> 00:27.694

A REALISTIC PICTURE

00:28.461 --> 00:29.929
OF A BURGER IN IT.

01:15.508 --> 01:16.409
IT WAS HARD, YOU KNOW,

NOT KNOWING ANYONE.

01:18.077 --> 01:18.778

01:35.762 --> 01:36.596
MAKING ME EAT VEGETABLES

01:36.663 --> 01:38.731

01:46.139 --> 01:47.006
&gt;&gt; MORE LIKE AN INTERNATIONAL

03:05.852 --> 03:06.619
THE FIRST WORD I'D USE

03:06.686 --> 03:07.620
TO DESCRIBE THE COMPANY.

A DOUBLE WINDSOR IN MY NECKTIE,

03:21.334 --> 03:22.101
AS OPPOSED

03:22.168 --> 03:23.369

03:23.436 --> 03:25.338
&gt;&gt; AND THIS DRESS, WHICH IS

A CUSTOM-MADE CARDELLINI,

03:26.906 --> 03:27.840
HAS A WHISPER OF COTTON

03:27.907 --> 03:28.741
WOVEN INTO THE FABRIC.

03:40.920 --> 03:41.688
&gt;&gt; I WONDER IF OUR TRUE

03:41.754 --> 03:42.455
HAS A POINT.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.056
ARE YOU THINKING

03:43.122 --> 03:44.357
WHAT I'M THINKING?

03:44.424 --> 03:44.891
&gt;&gt; WE ROLL UP TRUE

03:44.958 --> 03:45.658
IN SOME CARPET

03:45.725 --> 03:46.326
AND SHIP HER TO PARAGUAY?

03:47.961 --> 03:48.528
MAYBE WE CAN BE

03:48.595 --> 03:50.063
A BIT STUFFY HERE.

03:50.129 --> 03:51.030
PERHAPS OUR CASUAL LINE

03:51.097 --> 03:51.998
WOULD BE BETTER SERVED

03:52.065 --> 03:53.566
IF WE TRIED TO DRESS DOWN

03:53.633 --> 03:54.767
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

03:54.834 --> 03:55.835
&gt;&gt; WE COULD HAVE CASUAL DAY.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.603

04:00.807 --> 04:01.574
WILL BE FIRED.

04:01.641 --> 04:02.442
&gt;&gt; FIRED?

04:02.508 --> 04:03.109
WELL, DOESN'T THAT SEEM

04:03.176 --> 04:04.577
EXCESSIVE?

04:04.644 --> 04:05.545
&gt;&gt; YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT

04:05.612 --> 04:07.814
ROLLING ME UP IN SOME CARPET.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.182

&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE HIS HOBBIES?

08:48.628 --> 08:49.028
&gt;&gt; DIDN'T SAY.

08:49.095 --> 08:49.695
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S HIS LAST NAME?

08:49.762 --> 08:51.297

&gt;&gt; THAT WOULDN'T BE THE WORST.

09:02.808 --> 09:03.309
THE WORST WOULD BE

09:03.376 --> 09:04.110

09:04.176 --> 09:04.977
DUMPED A CAN OF SPIDERS ON YOU

09:05.044 --> 09:05.778

09:17.857 --> 09:18.891
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.092
&gt;&gt; I'LL MAKE YOU A BET.

09:20.159 --> 09:20.826
IF YOU ASK HIM OUT

09:20.893 --> 09:21.594
AND HE SAYS NO,

09:21.661 --> 09:22.695
I'LL KISS A PIGEON.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.063
&gt;&gt; LULU, YOU HATE PIGEONS.

09:24.130 --> 09:24.931
&gt;&gt; I KNOW.

09:24.997 --> 09:25.665
THEY'RE LIKE RATS

09:25.731 --> 09:26.365

09:26.432 --> 09:27.033
DIPPED IN DISEASE,

09:27.099 --> 09:31.370
WITH FEATHERS ATTACHED TO THEM.

09:31.437 --> 09:36.609
&gt;&gt; OKAY, I'LL ASK HIM OUT.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.843
&gt;&gt; I'M FURIOUS.

09:37.910 --> 09:38.577
&gt;&gt; DID THE CART GUY

09:38.644 --> 09:39.679
RUN OUT OF SAUERKRAUT?

09:39.745 --> 09:40.579
&gt;&gt; YES, BUT THAT'S NOT

09:40.646 --> 09:41.447

10:07.173 --> 10:09.342
WITH YOUR NAME AT THE TOP.

10:09.408 --> 10:10.009
&gt;&gt; WHY DON'T WE JUST

10:10.076 --> 10:11.043
WRITE THE WORDS "VICE"

10:11.110 --> 10:12.845
