and order in.

I had a connection

I'd never even met.

should set the table for dinner?

really not gonna like this.

I guess I'll just have
to tell Ryan the truth.

16:38.497 --> 16:42.084
You could, but there's a chance
he'll leave

16:42.126 --> 16:44.461
to go find his birth mother

16:44.503 --> 16:48.507
and that would leave
just you and I.

are so anxious to hire someone

17:51.528 --> 17:54.573
to take care of your kids,
but this time is precious.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.409
And sooner or later,
they're gonna push you away.

17:57.451 --> 18:01.288
And then you're gonna
miss the times when they did.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.270

in the dad game long enough

18:25.312 --> 18:26.730

18:26.772 --> 18:28.107
just when you've
convinced yourself

18:28.148 --> 18:29.733
that you're not needed,
that might be

needs you the most.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.671

and I suck.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.137

18:58.178 --> 19:01.348
Sometimes you remind me
so much of your mother.

19:05.602 --> 19:07.187
It's the jacket.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.482
No, it's not the jacket.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.902
I used to have to
give your mom a pep talk

19:13.944 --> 19:16.655
every time before
she got up onstage.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.491
She always thought
she was gonna suck.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.786
And sometimes she did.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.877
But most of the time...
she was pretty damn good.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.587
It was the first time
I had ever heard George

19:31.628 --> 19:33.463
talk like that about my mom

19:33.505 --> 19:35.132
and the old George
would have felt too threatened

19:35.174 --> 19:36.758
to draw a comparison
between us

19:36.800 --> 19:38.635
but the new George
must have known

19:38.677 --> 19:41.597
it was gonna
make me feel better

19:41.638 --> 19:42.723
because it did.

19:42.764 --> 19:46.101
Wow! Oh, wow.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.563
I honestly still can't believe
that show got canceled.

21:09.393 --> 21:12.145
and as the Shays
watched their potting shed

21:12.187 --> 21:14.523
and all its secrets
burn to the ground

21:14.564 --> 21:16.191

21:16.233 --> 21:19.486

we hold on to

21:19.528 --> 21:22.781
aren't nearly as important
as the things we let go of.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.783
