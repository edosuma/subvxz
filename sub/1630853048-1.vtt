WEBVTT

00:06.466 --> 00:09.177
[People shouting indistinctly]

00:30.323 --> 00:32.241
This one? This one?

00:32.450 --> 00:33.450
Come on.

00:52.094 --> 00:53.679
No, no, no!

00:57.642 --> 00:59.560
Two more! Yes?

01:00.436 --> 01:01.436
Yes.

01:01.854 --> 01:06.150
(Man) Pay heed to potiphar,
chief steward of the pharaoh.

01:06.526 --> 01:11.656
(Man 2) Shh! Shh! Quiet!
The slave market of avaris,

01:11.864 --> 01:13.533
crown city of Egypt,

01:14.075 --> 01:16.661
home to the pharaoh,
god to his people,

01:16.869 --> 01:18.913
welcomes the chief steward

01:19.121 --> 01:21.290
and the head
of pharaoh's guards,

01:21.874 --> 01:24.835
the most honored... pofiphafl

01:25.044 --> 01:27.129
(crowd) Potiphar! Potiphar!

01:27.421 --> 01:31.050
Potiphar! Potiphar!

01:36.222 --> 01:39.475
I have fine slaves.
Both of them are excellent.

01:39.684 --> 01:41.519
Which one do you want?
Which one?

01:45.940 --> 01:47.692
Do you want one of these?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.442
No.

01:49.569 --> 01:52.029
No? This one? Look.

01:53.698 --> 01:55.575
There? In the corner?

02:03.583 --> 02:04.875
This one?

02:06.168 --> 02:07.795
[Laughs]

02:10.965 --> 02:13.634
This one, sir?
He's the best, sir.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.636
He's a fine slave, sir.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.597
Look at that fine head.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.515
Look. Look at those shoulders.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.059
Back. Those arms.

02:22.268 --> 02:23.394
He is perfect.

02:27.023 --> 02:28.774
Ah! Teeth.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.401
Young.

02:32.987 --> 02:33.987
He's healthy enough,

02:34.071 --> 02:36.741
but probably never done
a hard day's labor in his life.

02:36.991 --> 02:39.619
Ah, but he can
be trained, master.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.704
He... he's submissive.

02:41.912 --> 02:44.915
He's obedient. He'll do
anything without a whimper.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.209
And he knows his place.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.503
Never opens his mouth
except to pray.

02:53.549 --> 02:54.800
Is that true, boy?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.055
Answer the master.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.909
And to whom
are these prayers addressed?

03:04.268 --> 03:05.311
Which gods?

03:06.479 --> 03:08.230
Only one, my lord.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.566
Only one god.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.362
Must be very poor indeed.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.447
[Crowd laughs]

03:25.706 --> 03:26.706
Well, boy.

03:28.959 --> 03:32.171
My one god provides
all my needs, my lord.

03:32.588 --> 03:34.799
Well, he hasn't done very well
for you now, has he?

03:35.007 --> 03:38.010
[Crowd laughs]

03:40.471 --> 03:45.101
These semites are
a superstitious lot, my lord.

03:45.309 --> 03:45.810
These what?

03:46.060 --> 03:46.852
(Slave dealer) Semites.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.061
Semites?

03:48.771 --> 03:49.771
Semites.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.317
But when they are not praying,
they work very hard.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.235
Hard workers, are they?

03:55.277 --> 03:56.277
(Slave dealer) Yes!

03:57.822 --> 04:00.408
I don't know, I don't know.
What do you think, overseer?

04:00.783 --> 04:02.785
I could knock the piety
out of him, master.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.119
I know that.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.205
When I finish with him,

04:06.622 --> 04:08.499
he'll need a city full of gods.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.167
He's young.

04:10.376 --> 04:13.629
There would be ten more good
years in a slave like this.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.969
[Crowd muttering]

04:20.177 --> 04:21.303
Aah!

04:24.265 --> 04:25.307
Stupid!

04:25.516 --> 04:28.936
We could have made a fortune.
You destroyed the deal.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.689
Stupid!

04:32.064 --> 04:35.651
Oh, my lord! Come and
have a closer look, my lord.

04:41.115 --> 04:45.369
[Crowd goes silent]
[Distant dog barking]

05:04.930 --> 05:06.515
The boy's amusing.
For a good price,

05:06.724 --> 05:07.884
I'll take him off your hands.

05:08.017 --> 05:12.188
He wants you! Did you hear
that? He wants you!

06:50.953 --> 06:52.913
(Ednan) Come on. Move on!

07:10.222 --> 07:11.223
Move the other way!

07:16.729 --> 07:18.606
My name is ednan!

07:19.565 --> 07:20.565
You

07:21.609 --> 07:22.609
sleep here.

07:24.528 --> 07:27.156
You bathe each day.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.826
The mistress likes
her slaves clean

07:31.327 --> 07:32.411
and silent.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.579
She sleeps

07:35.331 --> 07:36.874
sixteen hours a day.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.792
Remember that.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.131
Before work each day...

07:45.633 --> 07:47.343
We give praise to amun,

07:49.011 --> 07:50.387
father of all gods.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.849
And praise is how you
begin your life here.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.645
Praise to the all-powerful amun!

07:57.853 --> 08:00.189
(Slaves)
Praise to the all-powerful amun!

08:00.397 --> 08:02.399
(Ednan)
Praise to the all-powerful amun!

08:02.608 --> 08:04.985
(Slaves)
Praise to the all-powerful amun!

08:08.447 --> 08:10.157
I thought you were pious, boy.

08:13.452 --> 08:15.287
Are you too good
to praise our god?

08:15.829 --> 08:17.998
No, master. Not too good.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.041
Then what?

08:22.336 --> 08:26.256
I've... I've only ever prayed
to the god of my fathers.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.842
[Chuckles]

08:29.051 --> 08:30.844
Well, you won't
find him in Egypt.

08:31.679 --> 08:34.181
Don't you think you could use
amun's good graces?

08:37.809 --> 08:38.977
I need workers, boy,

08:40.104 --> 08:41.230
not holy men.

08:42.106 --> 08:46.819
I'll just have to teach you to
learn respect for my gods. Eh?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.238
[Laughs]

08:53.701 --> 08:56.495
Now sleep! All of you!

08:59.915 --> 09:01.834
(Man) Move! Move!

09:12.386 --> 09:14.596
Don't muddy the water.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.641
Come with me.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.354
Man: All of you, stack
them in the shade.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.153
Fill the urn with water.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.614
Run, holy boy, run!

09:39.872 --> 09:40.914
I said run!

09:51.467 --> 09:53.177
Come on, boy.

10:03.020 --> 10:04.646
Where's your god now?

10:05.564 --> 10:07.816
He doesn't seem
very powerful to me.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.861
Are you ready
to praise amun yet?

10:11.070 --> 10:12.070
Hmm?

10:12.696 --> 10:13.697
Not ready?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.040
You spilled the water!

10:23.665 --> 10:24.958
Refill the urn.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.417
Now.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.927
It's a fight you want, is it?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.511
Huh?

10:51.777 --> 10:54.279
(Ednan) Come on.
Put your backs into it.

11:02.329 --> 11:03.329
Get back.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.938
(Man) It's very
definite instructions.

11:28.147 --> 11:28.897
But I thought...

11:29.106 --> 11:30.816
All of this area
should've been cleared.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.819
Look at this.
What are you doing, fool?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.613
I said put the bricks
against that wall,

11:36.822 --> 11:37.364
not this one.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.367
Quiet, man. It is the slave
who is right. They do go here.

11:40.784 --> 11:41.577
The soil over there

11:41.785 --> 11:44.371
is too porous. The shrine
would sink in a month.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.206
We'd both lose our heads.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.584
Keep to the plans, ednan.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.087
Follow the dimensions
exactly as I've written them.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.296
It's simple enough.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.244
Ah?

12:26.371 --> 12:28.665
It's no good to me.
I can't read, idiot.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.752
I can.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.591
A slave who can read?

13:00.364 --> 13:02.115
According to this,
we begin here.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.913
That slave, who is he?

13:09.498 --> 13:11.458
Joseph the semite, mistress.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.169
(Mistress)
And he understands drawings?

13:14.711 --> 13:15.711
(Ednan) Yes, mistress.

13:16.255 --> 13:18.090
Explain his bruises.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.551
Well, I, uh...

13:22.928 --> 13:24.721
A slave's life, mistress.

13:25.389 --> 13:27.641
His lot is no different
than any other.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.268
Well, it should be.

13:30.352 --> 13:33.897
A good foreman would see
that this is a special man.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.635
My wife wishes
to compliment you, architect.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.847
The garden is
an absolute marvel.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.932
It's quite lovely.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.019
Thank you, mistress.
I wish only to serve.

14:54.686 --> 14:55.687
You've served well.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.648
I owe you a special gift.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.024
Name a prize.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.779
If it's not too forward,

15:04.404 --> 15:06.782
I should like to buy
one of your slaves.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.577
The one who can
understand drawings,

15:10.827 --> 15:11.995
the semite.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.832
Potiphar, I thought
you said you favored him.

15:16.792 --> 15:17.501
I did?

15:17.709 --> 15:18.709
Yes.

15:18.752 --> 15:20.670
And the good
architect is correct.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.756
We under-use
a slave of his skills.

15:23.799 --> 15:25.467
His manner is gentle,

15:25.675 --> 15:27.427
a quality lost
on ordinary labor.

15:27.636 --> 15:28.804
Bring the semite slave.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.972
(Edna) Semite! Here!

15:34.184 --> 15:36.228
They tell me I did well
the day I purchased you.

15:37.687 --> 15:41.400
I am grateful, master, that god
chose to be gracious to us both.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.608
What?

15:42.692 --> 15:44.778
(Ednan)
Surely you remember, master.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.947
He speaks incessantly
of his god.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.241
I'd be careful if I were you.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.577
You worship as you like
in canaan, but in Egypt,

15:52.828 --> 15:56.123
only pharaoh, son of ra, is god.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.125
Is this insolence, boy?

15:59.918 --> 16:01.378
- No, master.
- Good.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.631
I serve you with humility
and honest labor,

16:04.840 --> 16:07.467
but I cannot deny my god.

16:07.676 --> 16:10.178
A slave who insists
on his own ways.

16:10.387 --> 16:12.013
What do you make of that, wife?

16:13.056 --> 16:15.142
We have enough fools
who pander to us.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.144
If this state is to grow,

16:17.352 --> 16:19.232
an honest slave who can
read drawings and cipher

16:19.354 --> 16:20.856
would be a valuable addition,

16:21.690 --> 16:23.775
especially if we taught him
our own writing.

16:24.526 --> 16:25.526
You see

16:26.027 --> 16:28.196
the respect
the pharaoh's chief steward

16:28.405 --> 16:29.656
commands in his own home?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.868
Slaves instruct him on religion.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.036
His wife tells him
how to run his household...

16:35.245 --> 16:36.722
(Mistress) A good wife
keeps her wits about

16:36.746 --> 16:38.874
and draws attention
to what she sees as good.

16:39.082 --> 16:40.750
And you see the slave as good?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.171
They say whatever
he touches flourishes.

16:44.546 --> 16:45.589
Is this true?

16:46.882 --> 16:47.883
It is, my lord.

16:49.801 --> 16:50.802
Do you have a name?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.430
I am Joseph, master.

16:53.638 --> 16:54.931
Joseph, son of Jacob.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.517
[Laughing]
Well, Joseph, son of Jacob,

16:58.518 --> 17:01.813
do you think you could bring
some order to my household

17:02.022 --> 17:03.690
if I brought you
out of the fields?

17:05.275 --> 17:08.361
To be out of the fields,
master, I can do anything.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.571
Then out of the fields
you shall be.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.825
We'll see just how matters
flourish under your hands

17:14.451 --> 17:16.286
or the hand of your god.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.997
[Chuckles]

17:19.205 --> 17:21.625
Uh, you'll have to name
another prize.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.171
[Giggling]

18:28.608 --> 18:30.448
We've already got as much
in store as the whole

18:30.485 --> 18:31.570
of last year's harvest,

18:32.237 --> 18:34.072
and there's still
plenty left in the fields.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.158
Joseph, how do you do it?

18:39.077 --> 18:41.830
Ednan, I don't create
the crops for harvest.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.958
Must be. I know
potiphar thinks you do.

18:45.500 --> 18:46.900
Why else would he
dress you in robes

18:47.002 --> 18:48.003
as fine as these?

18:49.004 --> 18:51.590
Clothes mean nothing.
I'm still a slave.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.126
Mistress, please.
You should not be here.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.210
Really?

19:31.254 --> 19:33.673
Has my husband elevated you
to a position

19:33.882 --> 19:36.134
where you can
tell me where I belong?

19:37.927 --> 19:39.512
No, mistress. Of course not.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.015
Then be still.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.730
You have some dust

19:49.981 --> 19:50.981
on your shoulder.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.236
Here, let me
splash it off for you.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.031
Come on.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.375
[Sighs]

20:08.583 --> 20:09.709
You work hard...

20:11.378 --> 20:13.338
And you have
the muscles to prove it.

20:15.965 --> 20:21.471
I'm told the barley harvest is
even bigger than last season's?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.264
Yes, mistress.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.102
Joseph the golden.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.402
My husband is convinced
that your god is behind

20:35.610 --> 20:36.653
all of his success,

20:38.863 --> 20:42.283
that you are the key

20:42.492 --> 20:44.119
to everything he's
ever hoped for.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.746
My god provides for me.

20:51.751 --> 20:55.046
Would he Grant my wishes
if I were your friend?

20:57.966 --> 20:59.926
Please, mistress.

21:00.135 --> 21:02.137
I'm only flesh and blood,
and you press the limits

21:02.345 --> 21:02.971
of my strength.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.472
{giggles}

21:04.681 --> 21:06.850
you dare restrain me?

21:07.058 --> 21:09.894
If my master knew why,
he would understand.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.021
Really?

21:12.230 --> 21:15.859
Is it my fault you lured me here
to take advantage of me?

21:16.067 --> 21:18.445
He knows me better than that.

21:19.571 --> 21:23.867
It's my word against
that of a slave.

21:28.163 --> 21:30.081
Huh?

21:44.554 --> 21:46.473
Joseph.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.933
Come...

21:49.142 --> 21:51.311
Lie with me.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.354
Impossible.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.858
Potiphar has entrusted me
with all that is his.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.235
The only thing
I cannot touch is you.

22:01.529 --> 22:03.406
How could I betray
your husband's trust

22:03.615 --> 22:04.699
and sin against god?

22:10.121 --> 22:12.040
Time will come.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.443
Joseph.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.239
Mistress.

22:44.447 --> 22:46.324
Joseph.

22:46.533 --> 22:48.743
I thought we
understood each other.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.078
Oh,

22:50.286 --> 22:52.205
I understood you,

22:52.413 --> 22:55.166
but I think you misjudged me.

22:55.375 --> 22:57.126
[Laughing] So, I've decided to

22:57.335 --> 22:59.128
give you a second chance.

23:03.800 --> 23:04.800
Stop!

23:07.220 --> 23:09.514
[Shouting indistinctly]

23:50.680 --> 23:51.890
Where is he?

24:00.481 --> 24:03.943
What my wife's maidservant
ran to tell me, is it true?

24:06.905 --> 24:09.866
Would you have me call
your own wife a liar, master?

24:12.493 --> 24:14.454
[Sobbing]

24:22.879 --> 24:25.548
Oh! Potiphar!

24:25.757 --> 24:27.759
What took you so long?

24:27.967 --> 24:29.761
Didn't my maid tell you
of the pain I'm in?

24:29.969 --> 24:31.763
Yes, yes, yes,
of course she did.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.016
Of course, my love,
but the pharaoh has first call

24:35.224 --> 24:37.435
on his chief steward's time,
as well you know.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.146
Anyway... anyway, I'm here now.
I'm here now,

24:40.355 --> 24:43.024
and will right any wrong
that has been done.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.364
I... I was alone,

24:50.615 --> 24:51.615
and...

24:53.242 --> 24:54.242
He came here...

24:54.410 --> 24:56.245
He came to my chamber.

24:56.454 --> 24:57.246
On what excuse?

24:57.455 --> 24:59.916
That's exactly what I said,

25:00.124 --> 25:02.460
he just laughed at me.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.380
He said he needed no excuse,

25:05.588 --> 25:08.007
that he was your chief steward,

25:08.216 --> 25:11.135
and that I had to do
what he said or it would be

25:11.386 --> 25:12.428
the worse for me.

25:14.639 --> 25:15.723
He grabbed my arms.

25:15.932 --> 25:19.268
He forced himself upon me.

25:19.477 --> 25:23.147
I... I screamed
and I pushed him away.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.275
And then I
scratched wildly at him.

25:26.484 --> 25:27.610
You scratched him?

25:27.819 --> 25:28.945
Yes.

25:29.153 --> 25:32.740
With the power of the goddess
bastet with me,

25:32.949 --> 25:34.450
I drove him out!

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
I see.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.961
I want

25:45.169 --> 25:48.464
the full measure
of the law, husband.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.801
The full measure!

25:52.010 --> 25:55.013
I want his death.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.432
Go! Leave me with the slave.

25:59.684 --> 26:00.810
Come.

26:08.192 --> 26:10.236
I thought I could trust you.

26:10.445 --> 26:11.696
But you can, master.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.621
If anyone approaches,
keep your hands behind you.

26:20.830 --> 26:21.956
Thank you, master.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.374
Now explain yourself.

26:23.583 --> 26:24.667
How, master?

26:24.876 --> 26:27.879
She accuses you of
the vilest crime, Joseph,

26:28.087 --> 26:30.167
and demands the full measure
of the law in vengeance,

26:30.214 --> 26:31.007
which means your head.

26:31.215 --> 26:34.260
And a man guilty of that crime
would deserve nothing less.

26:34.469 --> 26:35.094
So you deny it?

26:35.344 --> 26:36.888
Yes, of course.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.348
But who would believe a slave
pleading for his life?

26:40.433 --> 26:43.311
I deserve better
than that from you!

26:43.519 --> 26:45.980
I've treated you more like
a son than a slave;

26:46.189 --> 26:47.940
trusted my entire estate to you,

26:48.149 --> 26:51.110
made you the law of my house in
my absence. You, a slave!

26:51.319 --> 26:53.237
Your lands prospered
under my hand.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.073
Which is why I'd
rather not see you dead.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.784
It would take me years
to find another like you.

26:57.992 --> 27:00.161
Is there nothing you can say
in your defense?

27:02.330 --> 27:04.749
Only if you allow me
to speak openly,

27:04.999 --> 27:07.043
as though I were a free man.

27:11.214 --> 27:12.423
So be it.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.886
But on this occasion only,
and no one must ever know

27:17.095 --> 27:18.638
I allowed you such a Liberty.

27:18.846 --> 27:20.681
You know you can trust me.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.101
I'd would never betray you,
not after all the goodness

27:23.309 --> 27:23.976
you've shown me.

27:24.185 --> 27:26.562
Wouldn't you call forcing
yourself on my wife a betrayal?

27:26.771 --> 27:30.191
Of course I would, and I repeat,
I would never betray you.

27:36.656 --> 27:38.658
You're saying my wife's a liar.

27:38.866 --> 27:40.201
That's not my place, master.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.870
But whatever happened
to her was not by my hand.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.623
I could not do such a thing.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.419
No, no, you couldn't.

27:50.628 --> 27:53.297
It goes against everything
I've ever seen in you.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.882
By all the gods!

27:55.091 --> 27:56.634
Why this now,

27:56.843 --> 27:59.387
when things were going so well
for my house?

27:59.595 --> 28:01.472
Give me a reason to believe you.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.855
When the blood runs hot,
a man forgets his acts have

28:09.063 --> 28:09.730
consequences.

28:09.939 --> 28:13.025
I have seen the evil
that comes from rape!

28:13.234 --> 28:17.321
It is hateful to me, and an
abomination in the eyes of god!

28:23.411 --> 28:24.620
Tell me more.

28:25.746 --> 28:27.290
Tell me more.

28:29.333 --> 28:34.297
Give me a way of proving this
isn't the way of a man like you.

28:38.009 --> 28:39.969
These are old memories, master.

28:42.847 --> 28:46.142
Thoughts of a better time
before my slavery.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.605
And thoughts of a great pain.

28:54.317 --> 28:58.529
If you value your life, Joseph,
you'll share them with me.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.081
I was only a child.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.961
And a happy one in so many ways.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.254
[Boy laughing]

29:21.510 --> 29:23.137
Father! Father!

29:24.305 --> 29:27.225
(Joseph)
During a long and hard journey,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.977
the lord, our god,
watched over us

29:30.186 --> 29:32.563
and brought us
to a fertile plain near

29:32.772 --> 29:34.690
the hivite town of shechem.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.402
Joseph.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.155
Gather the others.

29:41.364 --> 29:45.076
(Joseph)here, my father, Jacob,
said we should raise our tents.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.666
Quick. Father says
you must come.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.834
(Joseph)
There were my ten brothers:

29:54.043 --> 29:55.711
Reuben,

29:55.920 --> 29:57.630
simeon,

29:57.838 --> 29:59.548
Levi,

29:59.757 --> 30:01.175
and Judah.

30:04.387 --> 30:05.846
Dan,

30:06.055 --> 30:07.598
naphtali,

30:07.807 --> 30:09.475
gad and Asher.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.146
Issacan

30:14.397 --> 30:15.439
zebulun.

30:16.274 --> 30:19.443
It's time! It's time! It's time!

30:19.652 --> 30:21.404
(Joseph)
And there were his wives:

30:21.612 --> 30:24.073
Leah, who bore my father's
first sons.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.411
Rachel, my mother,

30:28.619 --> 30:30.496
the one my father loved most.

30:31.914 --> 30:34.292
And the handmaids,
zilpah and bilhah.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.878
And my sister, dinah.

30:49.640 --> 30:51.976
It was a happy time, master,

30:52.184 --> 30:54.520
a feeling we had
finally come home.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.901
The lord is truly our Shepherd.

31:01.110 --> 31:05.364
He has fulfilled the promise
made to me at Beth-El,

31:05.573 --> 31:09.452
and has led us safely back
to the land of my fathers.

31:10.786 --> 31:13.497
The lord is my god,

31:13.706 --> 31:16.792
the god of Israel.

31:17.001 --> 31:19.670
[Speaking in Hebrew]

31:19.879 --> 31:22.840
[Crowd repeating in Hebrew]

31:40.608 --> 31:42.109
(Man) Who are they?

32:07.051 --> 32:09.637
I am hamor, king of shechem,

32:09.845 --> 32:12.264
which lies behind those walls.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.849
This is bera, my counsel,

32:14.058 --> 32:17.311
and this is my son,
also named shechem,

32:17.520 --> 32:19.897
so there'd be no doubt
as to what the future holds

32:20.106 --> 32:21.106
for our city.

32:21.482 --> 32:24.276
I am Jacob, also called Israel,

32:24.485 --> 32:26.570
and these are my people.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.323
We come in peace,
in search of a land our god

32:29.532 --> 32:31.367
promised would be home for us.

32:31.575 --> 32:34.036
I see. And which god is that?

32:35.454 --> 32:36.664
We have only one.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.624
Just one?

32:38.833 --> 32:41.544
You must be a people
very short on feasts.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.839
Our lord provides.

32:45.047 --> 32:46.047
Indeed he does.

32:47.675 --> 32:49.885
Indeed he does.

32:50.094 --> 32:53.264
It was to him you
dedicated the sacrifice?

32:55.224 --> 32:56.892
But where's the idol?

32:57.101 --> 32:59.311
I'd like to see a single god
who could provide for you

32:59.520 --> 33:01.272
as well as this one
appears to have done.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.316
We keep no graven images.

33:04.525 --> 33:07.027
Even so, we know
he is always with us.

33:10.030 --> 33:13.075
You'll find we're
friendly people.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.244
And if you also come in peace,

33:15.453 --> 33:17.413
we welcome you
to camp near our city

33:17.621 --> 33:20.916
to find the home
your single god promised.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.627
We come only in peace.

33:23.836 --> 33:26.046
And of course we intend to pay
full measure for the land

33:26.255 --> 33:27.381
and the use of the spring.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.133
Just name the price.

33:30.926 --> 33:34.013
One-tenth of your grain
and of your flocks

33:34.221 --> 33:37.683
and a third of the animals'
increase for five years.

33:44.148 --> 33:45.232
Done.

33:45.441 --> 33:46.692
[People talking indistinctly]

33:49.528 --> 33:51.864
And I thank you
for your kindness.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.657
We shall be worthy neighbors.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.202
Neighbors, yes. Strangers, no.

33:56.827 --> 33:59.288
In a week we honor
the goddess astarte

33:59.497 --> 34:01.749
with a marriage
followed by a grand feast.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.251
You mustjoin us.
But we're so many.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.754
Then, at least
some representatives.

34:10.090 --> 34:11.382
Yoursons.

34:11.592 --> 34:14.762
Perhaps, uh,
the young girl here.

34:14.969 --> 34:16.429
(Jacob) Your invitation is kind.

34:16.639 --> 34:18.933
Count upon some of us
being among your number.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.735
I don't like it.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.655
They're fat townspeople.

34:32.862 --> 34:35.866
I say we keep our distance,
and if they give us trouble...

34:36.074 --> 34:38.077
Always the sword, simeon?

34:38.284 --> 34:40.621
Is the hard way
the only way you know?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.540
It's the surest way. No.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.083
The only sure way is
the way of the lord.

34:45.292 --> 34:49.420
As he has brought us thus far,
he will continue to guide us.

35:01.767 --> 35:02.893
[Gasps]

35:09.066 --> 35:10.066
Leah! Bilhah!

35:10.192 --> 35:11.192
Zilpah! Quick!

35:13.362 --> 35:15.781
It's nothing. It's nothing.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.033
This new child of yours
just keeps telling me

35:18.242 --> 35:19.326
that he's almost ready.

35:19.535 --> 35:22.204
Are you all right?
Yes, it's nothing. Go.

35:22.413 --> 35:24.790
- Go, it's nothing!
- Go, it's all right. Go.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.086
You must take better care
of yourself.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.589
There's no need for you
to be doing this heavy work.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.717
No, it's better that I work
here with the others.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.819
There's enough anger boiling
under the surface as it is.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.137
Under the surface
is where it will stay.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.347
Why else settle here,
even pay more for the land

35:40.556 --> 35:41.223
than it's worth,

35:41.432 --> 35:43.851
if not to give you a chance to
rest before you give birth?

35:44.059 --> 35:47.104
Because it's also proof that
the promises are coming true.

35:47.313 --> 35:50.232
We will inherit the land
that god promised to Abraham.

35:50.441 --> 35:53.694
I know that you accepted his
terms so that I could be settled

35:53.902 --> 35:55.487
when I have our second child,

35:55.696 --> 35:59.366
but, Jacob,
the others know it, too.

35:59.575 --> 36:02.620
Rachel, I've made no secret
of my love for you.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.288
I never have.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.624
You're first in my eye
and my heart.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.918
Second, Jacob.Second.

36:10.127 --> 36:12.338
Joseph comes first with you.

36:16.717 --> 36:19.094
[Singing indistinctly]

37:27.496 --> 37:28.706
[Music stops]

37:33.669 --> 37:36.213
[Music resumes]

38:04.533 --> 38:06.660
Wait, my dear.

38:06.869 --> 38:08.263
You're Jacob's daughter,
aren't you?

38:08.287 --> 38:09.287
Yes, I am.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.292
Let's sit here.

38:20.132 --> 38:21.258
No, thank you.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.010
Now enjoy yourself.

38:23.218 --> 38:25.095
This is a feast.

39:00.631 --> 39:02.841
Oh, poor girl.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.802
Are you all right, my dear?

39:08.013 --> 39:10.808
Don't worry. I'll see to her.

39:17.314 --> 39:21.193
You need a quiet moment
to gather yourself together.

39:21.401 --> 39:22.820
You'll be fine.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.988
I'll take you
to a cool room for a rest.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.995
You need to rest.

39:32.204 --> 39:34.081
Lie down here for a while.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.545
You'll be fine.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.271
[Gasps]

40:03.402 --> 40:05.571
Don't be frightened.
It's only me.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.990
Yes.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.117
I mean, I'm not frightened.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.287
You're perfectly safe.

40:14.413 --> 40:18.625
Nobody as beautiful as you
could ever really be in danger.

40:24.381 --> 40:27.426
You're a woman who can
have anything she wants.

40:27.634 --> 40:28.677
Yes.

40:28.886 --> 40:32.055
Well, not really a woman.
Just a girl, really.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.182
No, a woman...

40:36.184 --> 40:38.020
Whose face haunts me at night,

40:38.228 --> 40:42.357
whose smell makes my head spin.

40:42.566 --> 40:45.485
Please. I have to go.
I shouldn't be here.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.113
This is exactly
where you belong,

40:48.322 --> 40:50.073
with me. Hmm?

40:50.282 --> 40:52.409
Stay away. My brothers. Simeon!

40:54.953 --> 40:56.455
[Screaming]

40:56.663 --> 40:58.582
[Ululating]

40:58.790 --> 41:00.918
[Music & song continue]

41:13.221 --> 41:15.140
[Dinah screaming]

41:25.233 --> 41:28.278
There's no excuse for what
my son did to your daughter...

41:28.487 --> 41:29.613
To all of you.

41:31.365 --> 41:33.533
Other than
that he was drunk with love.

41:33.742 --> 41:36.078
[Grumbling]

41:36.286 --> 41:38.330
The crime shames us,

41:38.538 --> 41:39.998
violates all laws
and traditions.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.668
(Man)
No love can come from violence!

41:42.876 --> 41:46.254
I gave you my trust,
my friendship.

41:47.422 --> 41:51.635
Please, Jacob, listen.
I'm asking for your daughter.

41:52.886 --> 41:56.598
I ask for her
in marriage to my son.

42:04.982 --> 42:06.900
I'll do anything.
Whatever you ask.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.068
But I beg you,

42:10.529 --> 42:11.863
let me marry dinah.

42:12.739 --> 42:15.450
Your people and mine
can be one, Jacob.

42:15.659 --> 42:20.080
We will take your daughters as
wives, and you will take ours.

42:20.998 --> 42:22.833
Then you'll be
strangers here no more.

42:27.170 --> 42:28.523
That you seek a peace
that can wash away

42:28.547 --> 42:30.882
the stain of violence is good

42:32.467 --> 42:33.635
and appreciated.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.639
But our traditions and beliefs
demand that we can only

42:37.848 --> 42:40.934
marry those who worship our god,

42:42.144 --> 42:43.353
and our god alone.

42:44.938 --> 42:46.231
He's a good god, your god.

42:47.357 --> 42:49.484
We see his presence among you,
see how you prosper.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.362
We watched
your sacrifice to him.

42:53.613 --> 42:54.865
We respect your beliefs,

42:56.033 --> 42:57.951
and we can learn
to worship as you do.

42:58.326 --> 43:01.371
And you can embrace
all our rituals?

43:09.713 --> 43:11.339
We both have much
to think about.

43:13.341 --> 43:15.302
Until tomorrow, perhaps.

43:16.511 --> 43:17.846
Until tomorrow, then.

43:21.016 --> 43:23.268
[Grumbling]

43:27.314 --> 43:28.607
[Sobbing]

43:34.613 --> 43:36.698
Be strong, little one.

43:48.210 --> 43:50.128
Is it that simple?

43:50.337 --> 43:52.589
They take our sister
for a whore,

43:52.798 --> 43:55.050
and the reward is
we embrace them?

43:55.258 --> 43:56.343
Make them family?

43:56.551 --> 43:58.637
Masters of our women's dowries?

44:01.348 --> 44:03.725
- Not if I have a say in it.
- But you don't.

44:04.601 --> 44:06.269
None of us do.

44:06.478 --> 44:09.773
This decision is
for our father alone.

44:09.981 --> 44:13.527
I've heard enough. You're like
the women, clucking away.

44:14.778 --> 44:16.696
Good night, brothers.

44:20.700 --> 44:22.536
He's right.
It is father's decision.

44:22.744 --> 44:25.622
Yes, but what happens after that

44:25.831 --> 44:27.791
is something else altogether.

44:29.209 --> 44:30.209
Go on.

44:30.919 --> 44:35.966
Accepting our rituals means all
their males must be circumcised.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.551
And if they are...

44:38.301 --> 44:40.178
They'll be sick.

44:40.387 --> 44:41.387
Weak.

44:42.556 --> 44:44.141
At our mercy.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.269
Get to the pastures.

44:47.477 --> 44:50.105
Spread the word.
We'll need every man.

44:50.313 --> 44:52.732
Three days is what it takes
for the fever and the weakness.

44:52.941 --> 44:55.318
By the fourth morning,
it'll have passed,

44:55.527 --> 44:56.820
along with our one chance.

44:57.028 --> 44:59.156
Yes. [Muttering]

45:10.333 --> 45:13.420
Well, Israel, have
you thought upon it?

45:15.797 --> 45:16.840
I have.

45:18.884 --> 45:21.136
And I see great wisdom
in your offer.

45:21.344 --> 45:25.265
But have you considered what you
must do to marry amongst us?

45:27.017 --> 45:30.562
Circumcision is a harsh demand
to make of grown men, Jacob.

45:30.770 --> 45:33.106
But absolutely necessary.

45:33.315 --> 45:36.109
It is a sign we bear
on our flesh of our covenant

45:36.318 --> 45:37.318
with our lord,

45:37.360 --> 45:40.447
(Jacob) A proof that we embrace
his commandments.

45:40.655 --> 45:45.994
Only then can we be allowed
to be united through marriage.

45:54.044 --> 45:55.044
So be it.

45:55.170 --> 45:57.005
Our men shall be circumcised,

45:57.214 --> 46:00.217
and we shall be united in peace,

46:00.425 --> 46:02.928
a new and strong people.

46:55.105 --> 46:56.106
[Grunts]

47:00.026 --> 47:01.069
[Grunts]

47:08.702 --> 47:09.702
[Screams]

47:09.786 --> 47:11.997
[Yelling]

47:25.093 --> 47:26.303
[Shouting]

48:02.839 --> 48:05.258
(Dinah) Levi! No!

48:05.467 --> 48:06.760
[Screams]

48:08.094 --> 48:10.430
Come! Come!

48:15.602 --> 48:17.562
[Wailing]

48:25.362 --> 48:27.864
[Woman screaming]

48:36.706 --> 48:39.334
[Cheering]

48:44.089 --> 48:46.591
Yea! Hooray!

49:02.565 --> 49:03.942
Madness!

49:04.150 --> 49:05.150
Insanity!

49:07.028 --> 49:09.739
How in your hearts could you
have done such a thing?

49:11.408 --> 49:12.659
Ruthless!

49:12.867 --> 49:13.868
Merciless!

49:14.077 --> 49:16.663
Is this the good way?
The right way?

49:19.249 --> 49:21.418
You have brought ruin upon us.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.086
Someone had to defend dinah.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.574
She can't be treated as a whore!

49:24.712 --> 49:26.631
She was to be treated
like a bride!

49:28.425 --> 49:29.843
You've broken the peace

49:30.051 --> 49:33.388
and used our traditions
for vengeance.

49:35.432 --> 49:40.353
Now shechem's neighbors
will join forces against us.

49:40.562 --> 49:42.480
We're so few in number.

49:49.112 --> 49:50.697
Gather our things.

49:50.905 --> 49:52.991
We must leave this place.

49:53.199 --> 49:55.201
We must leave this place!

49:55.410 --> 49:56.619
Gather our things!

50:20.935 --> 50:23.021
(Joseph) And so, we were
forced to leave the land

50:23.229 --> 50:25.648
that held so much promise.

50:27.984 --> 50:30.778
We went up to Beth-El where
my father had once erected

50:30.987 --> 50:32.447
a monument to god,

50:32.655 --> 50:35.742
and again, god spoke to him.

50:35.950 --> 50:41.414
As my father told me, the lord
said, "be fertile and increase.

50:41.623 --> 50:43.416
"A nation,
an assembly of nations,

50:43.625 --> 50:45.043
shall descend from you.

50:45.251 --> 50:47.712
"Kings shall issue
from your loins.

50:47.921 --> 50:51.257
"The land I gave Abraham
and Isaac I now give to you.

50:51.466 --> 50:54.636
And to your offspring to come,
I will give this land.â€œ

51:10.693 --> 51:12.237
[Rachel screaming]

51:15.823 --> 51:18.535
[Screaming, gasping]

51:20.036 --> 51:23.414
Push! Push, Rachel. Push. Push.

51:23.623 --> 51:24.999
[Crying, screaming]

51:34.467 --> 51:37.178
[Baby crying]

51:39.764 --> 51:42.016
You have another son.

51:59.659 --> 52:01.286
(Woman) Rachel?

52:02.245 --> 52:04.581
Rachel? Stay awake, Rachel!

52:04.789 --> 52:06.040
- Jacob!
- (Woman) Rachel!

52:06.249 --> 52:08.001
- (Leah) My sister!
- (Woman) Rachel!

52:08.209 --> 52:09.377
(Leah) She's dying!

52:21.764 --> 52:23.391
Call him...

52:24.976 --> 52:27.395
Ben-oni:

52:27.604 --> 52:29.897
Child of... of pain.

52:31.274 --> 52:32.817
No.

52:33.026 --> 52:34.944
Not Ben-oni.

52:35.153 --> 52:38.281
Ben-jamin:

52:38.489 --> 52:40.241
Child of happiness.

52:49.792 --> 52:51.085
[Women wailing]

53:03.139 --> 53:04.557
Josephljoseph!

53:05.642 --> 53:07.518
Josephljoseph!

53:07.727 --> 53:10.271
Benjamin! Benjamin!

53:10.480 --> 53:11.189
Benjamin!

53:11.397 --> 53:12.397
Joseph!

53:12.482 --> 53:13.482
Benjamin!

53:13.524 --> 53:15.234
[Laughing]

53:22.408 --> 53:23.701
Whoa!

53:36.214 --> 53:37.215
Bilhah.

53:38.841 --> 53:40.510
Bilhah, spend a moment with me.

53:41.969 --> 53:42.970
I have work, Reuben.

53:43.179 --> 53:46.557
But I have things to tell you.
Important things.

53:46.766 --> 53:48.601
Perhaps tomorrow.

53:49.852 --> 53:52.689
You know this is my last night.

53:52.897 --> 53:54.023
When Jacob returns,

53:54.232 --> 53:56.442
I must go out with the herds.
I know.

53:56.651 --> 53:57.819
So,

53:58.027 --> 54:00.321
this is my last
chance to speak to you

54:00.530 --> 54:01.864
privately.

54:02.073 --> 54:05.410
That's impossible, Reuben.
I belong to your father.

54:05.618 --> 54:07.203
For now, bilhah.

54:07.412 --> 54:08.413
But I am the eldest.

54:10.790 --> 54:13.251
And all the concubines
that belong to him

54:13.459 --> 54:15.878
now will belong to me sooner

54:16.087 --> 54:17.380
or later.

54:39.402 --> 54:40.486
[Whispers] Bilhah.

54:41.738 --> 54:42.739
Bilhah!

54:43.990 --> 54:45.450
Bilhah.

54:47.034 --> 54:48.244
[Whispers] Are you mad?

54:48.453 --> 54:50.163
I've got Benjamin
sleeping in here with me.

54:50.371 --> 54:51.371
Come, come.

55:02.633 --> 55:04.594
I thought you should know.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.846
I should send them both away.

55:07.054 --> 55:08.054
Go!

55:10.099 --> 55:13.227
How could he do this to me?
How dare he do this to me!

55:13.436 --> 55:14.854
Reuben seduces bilhah,

55:15.062 --> 55:17.607
Rachel's maidservant
who bore me children.

55:18.775 --> 55:20.276
Bilhah is like a mother
to Benjamin.

55:20.485 --> 55:23.029
Your sons give me
nothing but grief.

55:23.237 --> 55:27.283
Forcing us to leave shechem
like... like thieves!

55:27.492 --> 55:30.828
Forcing us to take Rachel on
a trek that... that killed her!

55:31.037 --> 55:32.413
And now this?

55:32.622 --> 55:35.208
He was wrong. I know that.

55:35.416 --> 55:36.834
But once you speak to him...

55:37.043 --> 55:38.169
No more words!

55:38.377 --> 55:39.712
Things must change!

55:39.921 --> 55:43.633
Reuben is my firstborn,
your first son.

55:44.258 --> 55:46.010
No more words!

55:47.929 --> 55:50.348
[Bleating]

55:58.773 --> 56:01.734
(Jacob) One phase of the moon,

56:01.943 --> 56:04.779
then you return
to help with the harvest.

56:04.987 --> 56:07.782
Be careful. Be alert.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.659
While you are gone,

56:09.867 --> 56:12.078
Joseph will be in authority.

56:12.286 --> 56:15.248
You will hear his words
as if they were mine.

56:17.667 --> 56:18.667
Joseph?

56:20.670 --> 56:23.589
Is this a game, father?

56:23.798 --> 56:25.007
I am the eldest!

56:25.216 --> 56:27.593
And the one who
shows me no respect!

56:27.802 --> 56:30.888
You and bilhah shame me
before the entire camp.

56:31.097 --> 56:34.517
Simeon and Levi betrayed
my word at shechem.

56:35.852 --> 56:37.854
If my sons will not honor me,

56:38.062 --> 56:39.689
I cannot honor them.

57:13.347 --> 57:15.641
[Bleating]

57:15.850 --> 57:16.850
[Shouting, laughing]

57:21.731 --> 57:23.941
Here! Here! Here!
Come here. Come here!

57:24.150 --> 57:26.944
What? See what Joseph does.

57:27.153 --> 57:29.572
Make him eat it. Yeah!

57:29.780 --> 57:31.657
Here he comes now.

57:33.743 --> 57:35.620
Meat for supper, little brother.

57:35.828 --> 57:37.038
Meat? From where?

57:37.246 --> 57:40.082
The sheep. You can pick the one
for slaughter if you like.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.084
Me? Never. Come on.

57:42.293 --> 57:43.437
Father specifically forbade us...

57:43.461 --> 57:45.379
Well, he's not here, is he?

57:45.588 --> 57:47.668
He's not stuck out here,
alone, baking under the sun,

57:47.757 --> 57:49.175
living on dried fruit.

57:49.383 --> 57:51.260
Here's a nice fat one
who'll stick to our ribs.

57:53.137 --> 57:54.597
But what will you tell father?

57:54.805 --> 57:56.015
He won't find out.

57:56.223 --> 57:57.016
At least, he'd better not.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.518
No wagging tongues.

57:59.727 --> 58:00.811
You'd lie to him?

58:01.020 --> 58:02.563
No. Us? No!

58:02.772 --> 58:03.856
We wouldn't lie.

58:04.065 --> 58:05.483
It's not our fault

58:05.691 --> 58:08.569
if the poor lamb strays off and
gets mauled by a mountain lion.

58:08.778 --> 58:10.237
Roar!

58:10.446 --> 58:12.740
Understand, little brother?

58:13.866 --> 58:15.026
What difference does it make?

58:15.159 --> 58:17.078
He's got more sheep than
anyone else in hebron.

58:17.411 --> 58:19.011
But father put me
in charge of the sheep!

58:19.205 --> 58:20.915
Sit down and be quiet.

58:30.049 --> 58:32.259
[Laughing]

58:35.346 --> 58:38.015
Come on, Joseph.
Have something to eat.

58:41.644 --> 58:44.772
It's only a lamb. [Man bleats]

58:44.981 --> 58:46.107
Poor little thing,

58:46.315 --> 58:47.675
mauled to death
by a mountain lion.

58:47.775 --> 58:49.068
Aww!

58:50.611 --> 58:52.488
Eat.

58:53.614 --> 58:54.740
I'm not hungry.

58:56.575 --> 58:58.244
Look at the hide.

58:58.452 --> 59:01.330
Any fool can see it was
killed by a wild animal.

59:01.539 --> 59:03.290
Let's give him
a close look! Hey!

59:07.962 --> 59:09.213
Any fool!

59:09.964 --> 59:10.964
Right,

59:11.007 --> 59:12.258
brother?

59:12.466 --> 59:15.011
Do you take me for a fool?

59:15.219 --> 59:17.596
I've been a Shepherd
my entire life.

59:17.805 --> 59:19.765
I know the problems
Shepherds face!

59:20.516 --> 59:21.934
And I also know their tricks!

59:22.143 --> 59:23.686
Father, we... silence!

59:23.894 --> 59:24.894
Now take it away!

59:25.062 --> 59:27.440
Get it out of my sight!

59:32.695 --> 59:34.989
At least now we know
what to expect from Joseph.

59:41.537 --> 59:42.663
Betrayal.

59:44.081 --> 59:45.081
He's a spy.

59:54.925 --> 59:56.594
He certainly looks
like a prince.

59:56.802 --> 59:58.304
So tall and strong.

59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.307
Oh, Jacob, it's
beautifully made.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.976
If only his mother
could see him now.

01:00:04.185 --> 01:00:05.185
It's wonderful.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:07.605
Surely, I don't deserve it.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.357
None of his brothers
have anything this fine.

01:00:10.566 --> 01:00:12.401
None of them deserve it.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.153
He does.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:17.531
He has proven his loyalty
and responsibility.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.033
He has earned the coat,

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:22.286
just as he's earned
the succession.

01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:24.997
Now leave me alone with him.
Go, all of you.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.541
Go.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:40.721
I'm honoring you, Joseph,

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:42.598
naming you my heir,

01:00:42.807 --> 01:00:44.809
next in line
as head of the tribe.

01:00:47.645 --> 01:00:50.147
You can count on all
your sons, father.

01:00:50.356 --> 01:00:52.191
Some more than others.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:54.819
Simeon, Levi, Reuben...

01:00:55.027 --> 01:00:56.862
I can never forget
what they did.

01:00:58.781 --> 01:01:02.785
The coat is a Mark
that you will carry on the line.

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:04.829
When you wear it,

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:08.332
remember it is a robe of honor.

01:01:13.379 --> 01:01:15.297
Now, get some sleep.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:16.966
We have a lot of work to do.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.093
The harvest starts tomorrow.

01:01:29.311 --> 01:01:30.813
[Sheep bleating]

01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:40.322
(Benjamin) Joseph,

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:44.451
tell me again
what our mother was like.

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.164
[Whispering] She was gentle,

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:51.750
kind,

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:53.919
loving,

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:56.672
and very beautiful.

01:01:56.881 --> 01:02:00.843
More beautiful
than Leah, zilpah and bilhah?

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:02.887
Yes, much more.

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:08.184
Is it true that I killed her?

01:02:08.392 --> 01:02:10.227
Of course not.

01:02:10.436 --> 01:02:12.313
Where did you ever
get such an idea?

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:15.482
I heard some of the women
say that she died

01:02:15.691 --> 01:02:17.318
because I was born.

01:02:19.445 --> 01:02:21.280
That's a foolishness, Benjamin.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:22.990
That's not why she died.

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:25.618
Why, then?

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:31.916
I don't know why, Benjamin.

01:02:36.879 --> 01:02:38.297
People are born,

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:39.840
live...

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:43.677
And die.

01:02:43.886 --> 01:02:46.388
Even the stars fall and die,

01:02:46.597 --> 01:02:49.975
and the sun sets every day just
to be reborn the next morning.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:53.979
I wish I'd had known mother.

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:56.440
I'd never have let her go.

01:02:57.816 --> 01:02:59.818
It's not that simple,
little brother.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:02.154
Hush, now.

01:03:02.363 --> 01:03:03.572
Go to sleep.

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:10.120
Are you going to sleep
in your new coat?

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:11.705
Yes.

01:03:12.957 --> 01:03:15.000
I love it so much.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.341
I must sleep now.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.551
Tomorrow's harvest,

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.220
hard work.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.817
(Joseph) So then,

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:06.070
we all began to bind our sheaves

01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:09.198
and brought them together
and set them upright.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.406
And...

01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:13.327
As soon as they were on end...

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:17.915
Well, don't stop now.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:20.417
What happened?

01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:23.837
Then,

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:26.715
your sheaves all
prostrated themselves.

01:05:26.924 --> 01:05:28.044
They bowed down before mine.

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:30.094
That's it! I've taken all I can.

01:05:30.302 --> 01:05:31.862
The boy's gone crazy
because of father's

01:05:31.887 --> 01:05:32.471
promises to him.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.223
He already thinks
he's our master.

01:05:34.431 --> 01:05:35.682
I also had a dream.

01:05:35.891 --> 01:05:37.935
In mine, there were
12 piles of manure.

01:05:38.143 --> 01:05:39.937
The smallest one
walked and talked

01:05:40.145 --> 01:05:41.145
and told tales!

01:05:41.188 --> 01:05:43.357
No, be serious.

01:05:43.565 --> 01:05:45.317
I've had enough of him.

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:47.403
It's time we had this out.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:50.280
Tonight, after the day's work.

01:05:51.323 --> 01:05:52.866
[Laughing]

01:05:56.078 --> 01:05:58.539
We'll see what father
thinks about this.

01:06:06.130 --> 01:06:09.091
So, we all began
to bind our sheaves

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:12.970
and brought them together
and set them upright.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:15.139
And as soon as they were on end,

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:18.559
their sheaves
bowed down before mine.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:21.145
Do you hear that, father?

01:06:21.353 --> 01:06:23.230
He dreams of being our master!

01:06:23.439 --> 01:06:24.940
This has to be stopped!

01:06:25.149 --> 01:06:26.942
Now that, simeon,
is as foolish a thing

01:06:27.151 --> 01:06:28.151
as I've ever heard.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.070
Should I order the boy
to stop dreaming?

01:06:30.279 --> 01:06:32.114
Dreams have meanings.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:34.825
And when god intends
for us to understand them,

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.368
he'll make it all clear.

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:39.496
Until such time,
all we can do is listen.

01:06:40.831 --> 01:06:42.749
Joseph, you spoke
of another dream.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:44.376
Yes, father.

01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:46.462
(Jacob) Tell us.

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:51.800
(Joseph)
I'd better not, I think.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:54.428
If god gave you a dream,
you must share it with us.

01:06:59.308 --> 01:07:03.604
I dreamt the sun and the moon
and the stars paid homage to me.

01:07:03.812 --> 01:07:05.355
[All chuckling]

01:07:07.608 --> 01:07:10.068
I-I don't know what that means.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:12.404
Am I the sun, perhaps?

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:13.654
Surely not!

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:15.824
Your mother, the moon;
Your 11 brothers, the stars?

01:07:16.033 --> 01:07:18.285
I mean, should we
all bow down to you?

01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:21.955
Now you've listened
to this madness.

01:07:22.164 --> 01:07:24.500
Perhaps we can go back
to the way things were...

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:26.793
The way things ought to be.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:28.545
Yes, I'm sure you'd like that,

01:07:28.754 --> 01:07:32.049
but Joseph's dreams do not
change what happened at shechem.

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.884
Or with the lambs of the fields.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.261
Dreams do not
change my decisions.

01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:59.826
I'm sending you to see
how the flocks are doing,

01:08:00.035 --> 01:08:01.328
not to a feast.

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:05.165
Son,

01:08:05.374 --> 01:08:07.626
you're getting older, bigger,

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:10.963
and where once your
brothers might resent you,

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.756
as you gain strength
and position,

01:08:12.965 --> 01:08:15.217
they begin to feel
very threatened by you.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:19.470
I want you to try
and make peace with them.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.721
Yes, father,

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.599
that's also what I want.

01:08:22.808 --> 01:08:24.560
But sometimes the anger is...

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.310
Time will ease that

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:29.564
if you're more careful
of their feelings.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:32.234
Joseph, they're
different than you are.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:36.279
They're all brought up together
like a pack of lion cubs.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:39.616
You and Benjamin are
the children of my old age.

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:42.286
You were given more
attention, perhaps,

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.330
but your brothers
see that as more love.

01:08:47.207 --> 01:08:50.002
We both must help try
to make them see the truth.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:52.337
Understand?

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:55.215
- Yes, father.
- Good.

01:08:55.424 --> 01:08:57.216
Then go safely and
with a steady pace.

01:08:57.426 --> 01:09:00.345
You should find them
within a two-days' journey.

01:09:00.554 --> 01:09:02.930
[Bleating]

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.399
Each night grows colder
than the one before.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.752
We have another cycle of
the moon before we can return.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.321
I'm in no hurry.

01:09:17.529 --> 01:09:19.049
The only thing waiting
for us at hebron

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:21.700
is our new master
in his wonderful coat.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:23.452
Come, little sheaves.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.871
Bow down before
the great man, Joseph.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:28.040
[Laughing] Come on, bow!

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.291
Mercy!

01:09:29.499 --> 01:09:31.501
Mercy, master, please
have mercy upon us.

01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.921
A wild animal tore
a little lamb to pieces!

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:36.423
Please, please!

01:09:36.631 --> 01:09:38.884
Oh, we are innocent,
oh, great Joseph!

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.928
Please have mercy upon us!

01:09:42.136 --> 01:09:46.058
No, my brothers, I'm in
no hurry to see him again.

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:48.435
It's peaceful here.

01:09:48.644 --> 01:09:50.937
Unless he comes looking for us.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.314
I think we should move west.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.150
What makes you think
the pastures will be

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:56.526
any better somewhere else?

01:09:56.735 --> 01:10:00.238
We'll move west tomorrow
to the region near dothan.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:02.449
The grass will be Fuller there.

01:10:02.658 --> 01:10:05.952
Listen to him give orders
and predict what we'll find!

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.748
Must have been a dream.
Runs in the family.

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:10.956
[All laughing]

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:16.338
The only thing
I dream about is women.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:19.007
But I do know that
if we move on,

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.759
no one will know where we are.

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:24.763
And no one will

I had three women.

the other gold, the third...

with his last dream.

Stop it, it's only a dream.

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:58.523

and scraping to him,

01:11:58.732 --> 01:12:00.192

with him, once and for all.

then throw him in a pit,

your brother's blood!

We tried this with the lamb.

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:57.528
Father saw right
through the lie.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:58.947
Imagine what he'd make of this.

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.406
The fact that he caught us
in the last lie would make this

01:13:01.545 --> 01:13:02.671
one all the more believable.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.548

to lie a second time!

which will fall upon us

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.098
Mistress.

01:23:39.599 --> 01:23:41.225
Joseph.

01:23:41.434 --> 01:23:43.728
I thought we
understood each other.

01:23:43.936 --> 01:23:45.313
Oh,

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.315
I understood you.

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.234
But I think you misjudged me.

01:23:50.443 --> 01:23:51.777
[Laughing] So,

01:23:51.986 --> 01:23:54.489
I've decided to give you
a second chance.

01:23:58.993 --> 01:24:01.454
Stop!

01:24:02.413 --> 01:24:04.624
Oh, Joseph.

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:08.419
Perhaps...

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:11.547
Perhaps if we talked more...

01:24:13.549 --> 01:24:16.385
Became close...

01:24:18.262 --> 01:24:21.224
Perhaps you might
see me differently.

01:24:22.683 --> 01:24:25.061
You might see how

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:27.438
melancholy I am.

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:29.732
My husband is so

01:24:29.941 --> 01:24:32.318
busy all the time.

01:24:32.527 --> 01:24:35.404
Lonehnessis
a terrible thing, Joseph.

01:24:35.613 --> 01:24:37.406
I know you hurt, but...

01:24:39.659 --> 01:24:43.120
Oh, you are not a common man.

01:24:45.248 --> 01:24:47.917
Where does the mystery
come from, with you?

01:24:49.794 --> 01:24:52.171
Where are you from?

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.341
This house is my home now.

01:24:56.801 --> 01:25:00.137
Tell me about your father.

01:25:00.346 --> 01:25:03.891
You once said he was a prince.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:07.728
Does he have many
herds of animals?

01:25:07.937 --> 01:25:09.855
Servants, fields?

01:25:10.064 --> 01:25:11.064
Yes.

01:25:13.484 --> 01:25:17.154
So he's a powerful man.

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.824
Do you think he's happy
with his wealth?

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.160
I don't think my father's
wealth brings him much joy.

01:25:25.079 --> 01:25:26.872
Then what would?

01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:28.124
Hmm?

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:31.961
I expect if he could
see me again.

01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:37.550
You know, your freedom
is within my gift.

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:40.052
Yes.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:45.224
But, I can't.

01:25:45.433 --> 01:25:47.101
It would offend god.

01:25:49.103 --> 01:25:52.064
You know you want me.

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.275
Look how you're shaking.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:58.654
You want me as
much as I want you.

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:00.781
Come, Joseph.

01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:03.701
Come lie with me.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:05.036
[Gasps]

01:26:05.244 --> 01:26:06.245
Leave me!

01:26:07.872 --> 01:26:08.873
Stop!

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:12.710
Who do you think you are,
you fool?

01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:15.921
You dare lay a hand
on your mistress?

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:21.886
Ah, my husband would
kill you for this.

01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:25.139
[Ripping]

01:26:31.479 --> 01:26:34.148
[Screams]

01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:37.401
Is that all?

01:26:39.612 --> 01:26:43.115
As I swear before
the lord, my god.

01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:23.155
Summon the household.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.333
Good.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:38.671
Let them all hear him sentenced

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:40.297
to death.

01:27:58.482 --> 01:28:00.443
I have heard the reports

01:28:00.651 --> 01:28:03.195
and weighed them.

01:28:03.404 --> 01:28:04.613
The slave is guilty.

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:08.242
Here, then, is my decision.

01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:11.704
As I say it, so it be written,
so it be done.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:14.874
The slave is to be taken
to the pharaoh's prison

01:28:15.082 --> 01:28:17.626
and held there at my pleasure.

01:28:17.835 --> 01:28:20.796
The jailer is to report to me
weekly on his treatment

01:28:21.046 --> 01:28:22.089
and his progress.

01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:27.052
Thus is this matter now closed.

01:28:45.321 --> 01:28:46.322
Bring him.

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:17.311
You humiliated me.

01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:21.482
You sent him to prison
at your pleasure?

01:29:22.525 --> 01:29:25.236
What about my honor?

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:27.570
What honor?

01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:29.573
How dare you?

01:29:29.782 --> 01:29:32.034
I know you, wife.

01:29:35.329 --> 01:29:36.372
I know you.

01:29:38.207 --> 01:29:41.335
You don't understand.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:44.421
[Sighs]

01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:48.300
Whatever you believe of me...

01:29:50.928 --> 01:29:53.597
How can you let him live?

01:29:55.683 --> 01:29:58.644
How can you humiliate me
like that?

01:30:02.857 --> 01:30:06.360
Because one humiliation
deserves another.

01:30:11.532 --> 01:30:12.533
Wife...

01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.955
Anyone who knows Joseph also
knows that if he swears by

01:30:18.205 --> 01:30:20.291
his god, he's telling the truth.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:23.460
What is more important to you?

01:30:24.879 --> 01:30:26.422
His god...

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.217
Or my good name?

01:30:30.426 --> 01:30:31.635
The truth.

01:30:34.013 --> 01:30:35.014
Truth.

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:38.225
Yes, that's what matters.

01:30:39.268 --> 01:30:41.395
Well then,

01:30:41.604 --> 01:30:44.648
you might as well
set him free...

01:30:45.983 --> 01:30:48.736
And complete my shame.

01:30:57.202 --> 01:31:00.080
Wherever he is,

01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:03.500
whatever happens to him,

01:31:03.709 --> 01:31:05.419
he is free.

01:31:07.296 --> 01:31:09.214
Because his god is with him.

01:31:12.426 --> 01:31:14.762
[Thunderclap]

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.722
[Men wailing]

01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:18.807
[Whips cracking]

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.978
[Men screaming]

01:31:37.952 --> 01:31:41.664
(Man) Get in there!
Come on! Move!

01:31:52.466 --> 01:31:53.968
God!

01:31:55.386 --> 01:31:57.179
My god!

01:31:58.806 --> 01:32:01.433
Why have you forsaken me?

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:06.188
God!

01:32:10.275 --> 01:32:11.819
[People chattering]

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.465
[Shouting indistinctly]

01:34:17.194 --> 01:34:18.194
Come on.

01:34:27.746 --> 01:34:29.081
Pay heed to potiphar,

01:34:29.289 --> 01:34:31.208
chief steward of the pharaoh.

01:34:36.797 --> 01:34:38.048
Peace be with you, master.

01:34:38.257 --> 01:34:39.675
Do you know about this?

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:42.261
The warder said only to expect
two new prisoners.

01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:46.390
The excellence of your work here
is becoming common knowledge.

01:34:46.598 --> 01:34:49.810
They say the prisoners
have never eaten better.

01:34:50.018 --> 01:34:51.687
The warder's never been richer.

01:34:51.895 --> 01:34:53.730
The pharaoh has never
had to spend less

01:34:53.939 --> 01:34:55.274
to keep his jails running.

01:34:55.482 --> 01:34:57.401
Ten times a day
I'm asked how you do it.

01:34:58.318 --> 01:35:00.654
God blesses my work, master.

01:35:00.863 --> 01:35:02.239
As I've seen for myself.

01:35:02.447 --> 01:35:04.366
And I know that one day
he'll seen me gone

01:35:04.575 --> 01:35:05.325
from this place.

01:35:05.534 --> 01:35:07.137
Well, he'll have to deal
with the pharaoh first.

01:35:07.161 --> 01:35:09.246
I'm not so sure they're
on speaking terms.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:15.794
As you see,
two very fine specimens.

01:35:17.254 --> 01:35:20.007
Fine garments.
Royal eye tattoos.

01:35:20.215 --> 01:35:22.134
Men of station and breeding.

01:35:22.342 --> 01:35:24.553
The fat one is...

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:27.347
Well, was pharaoh's baker.

01:35:27.556 --> 01:35:29.933
The scrawny one, his cupbearer.

01:35:30.142 --> 01:35:32.060
Important men.

01:35:32.269 --> 01:35:34.104
How did they end up here?

01:35:34.313 --> 01:35:36.607
Accused of theft.

01:35:36.815 --> 01:35:39.151
The pharaoh's
bracelet of the sun.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:41.195
The Mark of the true sun god.

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:45.365
It's gone, you see.

01:35:45.574 --> 01:35:47.951
And the pharaoh's seers and
prognosticators say that one

01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.411
of these two is the culprit.

01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:51.914
(Joseph)
Then their lives are over.

01:35:52.122 --> 01:35:54.958
(Potiphar) Mmm, probably.

01:35:55.167 --> 01:35:57.336
But you never know
what can happen.

01:35:57.544 --> 01:35:59.379
And in case they ever
get out of this place

01:35:59.588 --> 01:36:01.548
and find themselves
restored at court,

01:36:01.757 --> 01:36:04.426
it would serve you well
to serve them well.

01:36:05.677 --> 01:36:06.887
You understand?

01:36:07.095 --> 01:36:08.513
Completely, master.

01:36:08.722 --> 01:36:10.390
You do this well, Joseph,

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:12.059
and you can give me
a valuable ally

01:36:12.267 --> 01:36:15.229
when the time comes to plead
your case with pharaoh himself.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:20.651
May your god be with you.

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.295
I am Joseph, my lords.

01:36:40.504 --> 01:36:43.382
I have been instructed to attend
you during your stay here.

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:47.052
Are you the warder?

01:36:47.261 --> 01:36:49.304
No, my lord, his servant.

01:36:49.513 --> 01:36:52.766
Ah, you must be the semite

01:36:52.975 --> 01:36:54.726
who does the warder's work
for him.

01:36:54.935 --> 01:36:58.230
I am honored that you
know of me, my lord.

01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:00.899
Huh. Yes.

01:37:01.108 --> 01:37:05.237
The court knows how well
you serve your masters.

01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:06.822
And their wives.

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:09.157
[Chuckles]

01:37:10.117 --> 01:37:13.078
There are many stories
that have no truth, my lord.

01:37:14.037 --> 01:37:17.374
Are you calling
potiphar a liar, slave?

01:37:17.624 --> 01:37:19.251
No, my lord.

01:37:19.459 --> 01:37:22.045
Are you calling his
beautiful wife a liar?

01:37:22.254 --> 01:37:24.172
I accuse no one, my lord.

01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:26.133
Really?

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:27.341
Well,

01:37:27.467 --> 01:37:29.636
I accuse you, slave!

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:33.765
I accuse you of staining
potiphar's wife's good name,

01:37:33.974 --> 01:37:36.184
of calling potiphar a liar!

01:37:36.393 --> 01:37:37.519
Guard!

01:37:37.728 --> 01:37:38.728
Guard, come here!

01:37:43.567 --> 01:37:45.027
Beat this man with your whip!

01:37:45.235 --> 01:37:47.237
Careful, my friend.

01:37:47.446 --> 01:37:50.157
We are in his prison.

01:37:50.365 --> 01:37:51.783
His prison?

01:37:51.992 --> 01:37:53.618
He's a slave!

01:37:53.827 --> 01:37:56.955
Potiphar will thank me
for punishing such insolence!

01:37:59.249 --> 01:38:01.626
Don't look to this slave
for permission.

01:38:01.835 --> 01:38:05.088
I serve in the court
of the pharaoh, god on earth!

01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:07.299
Do as I tell you!

01:38:13.722 --> 01:38:16.516
You will not slander
the name of potiphar!

01:38:18.268 --> 01:38:21.563
You will not slander
the name of his wife!

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:25.400
He will praise me

01:38:25.609 --> 01:38:28.278
for upholding his honor!

01:38:28.487 --> 01:38:31.073
Slave! Slave!

01:38:32.324 --> 01:38:33.909
Slave!

01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:22.332
They say this season's market
will be bigger than last.

01:39:22.916 --> 01:39:26.253
I hope so. It gets harder and
harder to scratch out a living.

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:28.463
Judah, you don't have
the animals to prosper.

01:39:28.672 --> 01:39:29.673
You know that.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:33.552
You need good rutting males,
healthy she-goats, ewes that...

01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:35.846
I won't return
to my father's camp.

01:39:36.054 --> 01:39:38.306
I can't live
with Jacob's sorrow.

01:39:38.515 --> 01:39:40.308
He still mourns
the loss of Joseph,

01:39:40.517 --> 01:39:42.853
and the entire settlement
is a pool of grief.

01:39:43.061 --> 01:39:45.230
As a widower,
I've enough of my own.

01:39:59.786 --> 01:40:01.830
I will give
your camel water, master.

01:40:07.836 --> 01:40:09.504
Now there's a sight.

01:40:11.423 --> 01:40:15.010
A whore. A canaanite
who hides her face.

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:17.137
They're always bewitching.

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:21.391
It's a strange custom,
but it adds to the mystery.

01:40:22.392 --> 01:40:24.102
(Woman) Traveler.

01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:26.688
Lie with me and ease your mind.

01:40:26.897 --> 01:40:28.982
[Chuckles]
By lining your pockets.

01:40:29.191 --> 01:40:31.193
Who can put a price
on a moment's escape from

01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:33.403
the troubles of the world?

01:40:34.279 --> 01:40:36.031
I have no money with me.

01:40:36.239 --> 01:40:38.200
My friend is a recent widower,

01:40:38.408 --> 01:40:40.994
and while he may not
have money with him,

01:40:41.203 --> 01:40:42.954
he does own fine flocks.

01:40:43.163 --> 01:40:45.207
Perfect animals.

01:40:45.415 --> 01:40:47.667
The softest fleece
you've ever felt.

01:40:48.877 --> 01:40:52.672
Though I can't say what someone
like you might have felt.

01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:56.384
I see no herds.

01:40:58.303 --> 01:41:00.138
They're at the market.

01:41:02.349 --> 01:41:05.268
I could bring you a sheep
on the way back.

01:41:07.938 --> 01:41:09.940
Tomorrow.

01:41:11.983 --> 01:41:13.360
And until then?

01:41:13.568 --> 01:41:15.612
Only my word.

01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:19.699
Then you can leave me your staff
and sea! As a pledge.

01:41:19.908 --> 01:41:22.285
Tomorrow, when you
bring the fleece,

01:41:22.494 --> 01:41:23.662
I'll return them.

01:41:30.919 --> 01:41:32.337
[Laughing]

01:42:51.541 --> 01:42:53.418
[Sighs]

01:42:53.627 --> 01:42:55.545
Life is hard on you?

01:42:57.047 --> 01:43:00.258
A barren daughter-in-law
that buried my first son.

01:43:01.676 --> 01:43:04.346
People die.

01:43:04.554 --> 01:43:05.554
They do.

01:43:07.015 --> 01:43:08.892
But as is the custom
with my people,

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:11.019
I forced my second son
to marry her

01:43:11.227 --> 01:43:14.481
so that his brother's
wealth would not be lost.

01:43:14.689 --> 01:43:16.191
And he, too, died.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:19.778
Misfortune indeed.

01:43:19.986 --> 01:43:22.447
You have other family?

01:43:22.656 --> 01:43:24.574
Eleven brothers.

01:43:26.159 --> 01:43:28.119
Once there were twelve,

01:43:29.829 --> 01:43:34.042
but the second youngest
was taken by a wild animal.

01:43:35.919 --> 01:43:37.379
And ever since, not a day passes

01:43:37.587 --> 01:43:40.340
but my father sheds a tear
at the youngster's memory.

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:44.678
His sorrow was so thick,
I had to leave and start

01:43:44.928 --> 01:43:45.970
my own encampment.

01:43:47.472 --> 01:43:50.308
You grieve as if
the boy's death was your fault.

01:43:50.517 --> 01:43:52.727
Never! In no way!

01:43:54.312 --> 01:43:56.690
Why would you even think
such a thing?

01:43:56.898 --> 01:43:58.733
No injury intended.

01:44:04.197 --> 01:44:05.949
You're a very fine woman.

01:44:07.951 --> 01:44:09.911
Thank you.

01:44:11.037 --> 01:44:13.707
Until tomorrow, then,

01:44:13.915 --> 01:44:16.251
when I bring you your fleece

01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:18.420
and redeem my staff and seal.

01:44:23.425 --> 01:44:25.343
Until tomorrow.

01:44:32.684 --> 01:44:35.770
Pay homage to potiphar,
chief steward to...

01:44:37.188 --> 01:44:39.065
(Joseph) Peace be
upon you, master.

01:44:39.274 --> 01:44:41.151
Guard the door, ednan. The door.

01:44:42.318 --> 01:44:43.319
Come.

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:47.540
The warder tells me
your distinguished guests

01:44:47.615 --> 01:44:48.655
aren't sleeping very well.

01:44:48.825 --> 01:44:50.702
It seems their sleep's
troubled by dreams?

01:44:51.327 --> 01:44:52.746
They're not alone.

01:44:53.455 --> 01:44:54.914
Strange dreams.

01:44:55.957 --> 01:44:57.667
Full of signs.

01:44:58.918 --> 01:45:01.629
As soon as I learned of this,
I came myself

01:45:01.838 --> 01:45:02.964
because I know of your gift

01:45:03.173 --> 01:45:05.008
for reading the
messages of the night.

01:45:06.176 --> 01:45:07.802
Here's a chance
to redeem yourself

01:45:08.052 --> 01:45:09.345
by interpreting for them.

01:45:09.554 --> 01:45:11.973
You can't remain silent
now that they know you have

01:45:12.182 --> 01:45:13.183
this special gift.

01:45:14.559 --> 01:45:15.935
How do they know?

01:45:16.436 --> 01:45:18.521
I'm due back at court.

01:45:18.938 --> 01:45:20.732
Pharaoh's men work night and day

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.692
to retrieve the bracelet.

01:45:22.901 --> 01:45:25.153
They'll have it before long.

01:45:44.672 --> 01:45:47.634
I hear you have
the gift of second sight.

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:51.095
At times, master, when god
sees fit to Grant it.

01:45:51.304 --> 01:45:52.931
How low have we fallen?

01:45:53.139 --> 01:45:55.308
Listening to the ramblings
of a semite slave.

01:45:55.517 --> 01:45:58.686
The ability to interpret dreams
is a gift from god.

01:45:58.895 --> 01:46:01.147
Then why don't you see
how well he can do

01:46:01.356 --> 01:46:02.356
for you, vintner?

01:46:02.524 --> 01:46:04.526
I intend to.

01:46:04.734 --> 01:46:06.694
Be seated, Joseph.

01:46:13.201 --> 01:46:15.620
Here is my dream.

01:46:15.829 --> 01:46:18.623
I was in a vineyard
in the countryside.

01:46:18.832 --> 01:46:20.583
There was a vine in front of me,

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:23.461
and on the vine
were three branches,

01:46:23.670 --> 01:46:25.964
one of which began to bud.

01:46:26.172 --> 01:46:29.676
Now, no sooner had it budded
than it blossomed,

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:32.679
and its clusters
became rich grapes.

01:46:34.472 --> 01:46:37.851
I had pharaoh's cup in my hand.

01:46:38.059 --> 01:46:40.645
I picked the grapes
and I squeezed them

01:46:40.854 --> 01:46:42.272
into pharaoh's cup.

01:46:43.648 --> 01:46:46.401
Then I handed
the cup to pharaoh.

01:46:48.236 --> 01:46:50.989
Now, can you interpret?

01:46:55.410 --> 01:46:57.287
This is what it means:

01:46:59.038 --> 01:47:01.749
The three branches
are three days.

01:47:01.958 --> 01:47:05.712
In another three days, the
pharaoh will lift up your head

01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:08.339
and restore you
to your position.

01:47:08.548 --> 01:47:11.676
Then you will hand the pharaoh
his cup as you have always done.

01:47:13.386 --> 01:47:15.638
Rest easy.
Your days here are numbered.

01:47:15.847 --> 01:47:17.390
Can it be true?

01:47:17.599 --> 01:47:18.599
[Baker laughs]

01:47:19.851 --> 01:47:21.477
Now listen to me, slave.

01:47:21.686 --> 01:47:24.188
I, too, had a dream.

01:47:25.106 --> 01:47:28.902
There were three
wicker trays on my head.

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:30.612
In the top tray

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:33.364
were all kinds
of pastries for pharaoh,

01:47:33.573 --> 01:47:35.950
such as a baker might make.

01:47:36.159 --> 01:47:40.496
But birds were eating them
off the tray on my head.

01:47:42.165 --> 01:47:44.125
Give me its meaning.

01:47:45.209 --> 01:47:46.586
I am sorry.

01:47:46.794 --> 01:47:49.213
I cannot interpret that dream.

01:47:49.422 --> 01:47:50.422
(Baker) You can.

01:47:51.758 --> 01:47:53.384
I know you can.

01:47:54.344 --> 01:47:56.471
You're hiding something from me.

01:47:57.263 --> 01:47:58.514
Tell me what it means.

01:47:59.891 --> 01:48:01.935
Very well.

01:48:02.143 --> 01:48:04.979
This is what I believe
your dream to mean.

01:48:06.147 --> 01:48:08.858
The three trays
are also three days.

01:48:09.067 --> 01:48:11.110
In another three days,
the pharaoh will lift up

01:48:11.319 --> 01:48:12.319
your head as well

01:48:14.656 --> 01:48:16.115
by hanging you from a gallows.

01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:19.452
Then the birds will eat
the flesh from your bones.

01:48:27.377 --> 01:48:29.337
The pharaoh's bracelet
has been found.

01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:33.758
Warrants have been issued.

01:48:33.967 --> 01:48:36.302
What does it say?

01:48:39.639 --> 01:48:42.016
She promised she'd be here!

01:48:42.225 --> 01:48:44.185
More to your good fortune
she's not.

01:48:44.394 --> 01:48:45.937
You kept your end
of the bargain.

01:48:47.271 --> 01:48:47.814
If she's not here,

01:48:48.022 --> 01:48:49.732
then you get
the sweet memory of her bed

01:48:49.941 --> 01:48:51.943
and get to keep your animals.

01:48:52.151 --> 01:48:55.238
I gave her my staff and sea!
As a pledge, remember?

01:48:57.198 --> 01:48:59.909
Come. I think
I can find her home.

01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:26.728
My punishment will never end.

01:49:26.936 --> 01:49:28.730
Neven

01:49:36.612 --> 01:49:38.197
[Men laughing]

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:47.915
[Laughing continues]

01:49:52.670 --> 01:49:55.840
I am most grateful for your
judgment in this matter.

01:49:56.049 --> 01:49:57.050
I always knew,

01:49:57.258 --> 01:49:59.111
even in the darkest days,
that I could always...

01:49:59.135 --> 01:50:00.136
Yes?

01:50:01.596 --> 01:50:05.349
I trust my master's stay here
was made as easy as possible.

01:50:06.142 --> 01:50:08.478
Yes, yes.

01:50:08.686 --> 01:50:11.439
Considering the circumstances.

01:50:30.166 --> 01:50:31.326
(Jacob) Now repeat everything

01:50:31.375 --> 01:50:32.710
you've learned, Benjamin.

01:50:34.378 --> 01:50:35.397
(Benjamin) The table of the

01:50:35.421 --> 01:50:36.756
descendants of terah,

01:50:36.964 --> 01:50:41.135
who was 70 when he begat
Abram, nahor and haran...

01:50:41.344 --> 01:50:43.184
Father, you know I have
the lines of our family

01:50:43.304 --> 01:50:44.097
completely memorized.

01:50:44.305 --> 01:50:46.557
Shouldn't I be helping my
brothers pen the flocks?

01:50:46.766 --> 01:50:47.433
(Jacob)
Their backs are strong enough

01:50:47.642 --> 01:50:48.851
for the job.

01:50:49.227 --> 01:50:52.939
For you, this is more important.
You have to carry on the line.

01:50:53.147 --> 01:50:56.067
But I'm the youngest, father.
Reuben, even Judah...

01:50:56.275 --> 01:50:59.695
Have spent a lifetime showing me
they're not up to the task.

01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.282
It would have been Joseph
who would've carried on

01:51:03.491 --> 01:51:04.909
the line, but...

01:51:05.118 --> 01:51:07.203
[Sighs] My other sons...

01:51:09.038 --> 01:51:10.957
It was a wild animal
who took Joseph.

01:51:12.667 --> 01:51:15.086
You can't go on blaming
the others forever.

01:51:15.294 --> 01:51:17.713
We must take our signs from god.

01:51:17.922 --> 01:51:19.924
In my heart,
I know Rachel was called

01:51:20.133 --> 01:51:22.426
to give us the next in line.

01:51:22.635 --> 01:51:24.679
And with Joseph gone,

01:51:24.887 --> 01:51:28.850
that means you must keep
our traditions alive.

01:51:29.058 --> 01:51:31.144
Maintain Abraham's
covenant with our lord,

01:51:31.352 --> 01:51:33.104
blessed be his name.

01:51:34.397 --> 01:51:36.566
Now, young man,
back to the tables.

01:51:39.861 --> 01:51:43.239
And the sons of Abraham
were Isaac and ishmael.

01:51:43.447 --> 01:51:46.492
And Isaac begat esau and Jacob.

01:51:46.701 --> 01:51:48.428
And esau, who was called edom,
took wives among...

01:51:48.452 --> 01:51:49.452
(Dan) Father!

01:51:49.537 --> 01:51:50.537
Father!

01:51:50.663 --> 01:51:51.831
Father.

01:51:52.039 --> 01:51:53.875
Quickly. It's Judah.

01:51:56.127 --> 01:51:58.379
Judah?

01:52:05.219 --> 01:52:07.221
(Man) Look, it's Judah!

01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:09.307
(Woman) Judah has returned!

01:52:14.478 --> 01:52:16.606
(Woman 2) Judah has returned!

01:52:23.237 --> 01:52:24.405
(Man) Judah!

01:52:29.202 --> 01:52:30.203
(Man) Judah!

01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:34.457
Reuben.

01:52:34.665 --> 01:52:35.665
Judah.

01:52:37.919 --> 01:52:38.919
Simeon.

01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:43.674
Levi.

01:52:45.426 --> 01:52:46.426
Dan!

01:52:49.138 --> 01:52:51.182
Naphtali, naphtali.

01:52:52.350 --> 01:52:53.351
Gad.

01:52:56.229 --> 01:52:57.521
Asher.

01:52:59.899 --> 01:53:00.899
Issacan

01:53:00.983 --> 01:53:01.983
hey, Judah.

01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:04.069
Zebulon.

01:53:06.239 --> 01:53:08.241
And little Benjamin.
Not so little anymore.

01:53:13.871 --> 01:53:15.331
And my father.

01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:18.542
My father, Jacob.

01:53:26.634 --> 01:53:28.386
Welcome to my...

01:53:28.594 --> 01:53:29.679
Our camp.

01:53:30.930 --> 01:53:32.932
To you and yours.

01:53:34.600 --> 01:53:36.894
Though I am surprised
to see you.

01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:39.480
I couldn't stay away
from you, father.

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:42.441
Especially now,

01:53:42.650 --> 01:53:45.027
when my clan faces a problem
that needs a wiser head

01:53:45.236 --> 01:53:46.236
than mine.

01:53:47.488 --> 01:53:49.323
What sort of problem?

01:53:50.157 --> 01:53:52.201
Tamar,

01:53:52.410 --> 01:53:54.370
widow of two of my sons,

01:53:54.578 --> 01:53:58.082
and betrothed to Selah,
my third, is with child.

01:53:59.375 --> 01:54:00.876
And Selah is the father?

01:54:01.544 --> 01:54:02.586
No.

01:54:02.962 --> 01:54:05.589
And she refuses to say
who she laid with.

01:54:07.758 --> 01:54:09.719
(Judah) And no matter how hard

01:54:09.927 --> 01:54:12.054
we press her,

01:54:12.263 --> 01:54:14.223
she stays silent.

01:54:14.432 --> 01:54:15.432
(Jacob) Then, by custom,

01:54:15.599 --> 01:54:16.684
she must be banished.

01:54:17.685 --> 01:54:19.353
But by canaanite way,

01:54:19.562 --> 01:54:22.356
when a woman lies with a man
other than her betrothed,

01:54:24.108 --> 01:54:25.276
she must die.

01:54:28.529 --> 01:54:30.072
What should I have done, father?

01:54:30.281 --> 01:54:34.368
I gave her my firstborn in
marriage and he died childless.

01:54:34.577 --> 01:54:36.454
So I insisted
my second son marry her,

01:54:36.662 --> 01:54:38.456
as his duty to the family.

01:54:38.664 --> 01:54:40.624
Still she remained barren.

01:54:40.833 --> 01:54:42.710
Then when he died...

01:54:44.086 --> 01:54:47.798
You promised your son, Selah,
as is our custom.

01:54:48.007 --> 01:54:50.509
But I kept delaying
the marriage.

01:54:50.718 --> 01:54:52.386
The woman's cursed, father.

01:54:52.595 --> 01:54:54.972
She buries husbands before there
are sons to replace them.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:54:59.393
I lost two boys I loved.

01:54:59.602 --> 01:55:02.063
Should I have risked a third?

01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:05.149
I know the pain of losing
a child you love dearly.

01:55:07.318 --> 01:55:08.611
I know it well.

01:55:12.907 --> 01:55:14.033
[Sighs]

01:55:15.242 --> 01:55:15.951
Yes?

01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.536
She will speak
of anything you ask

01:55:17.745 --> 01:55:19.955
except the father of the child
in her stomach.

01:55:20.206 --> 01:55:21.374
And she's unafraid.

01:55:21.999 --> 01:55:23.876
This is not our problem, Jacob.

01:55:25.127 --> 01:55:27.922
That much is true, Judah.

01:55:28.130 --> 01:55:30.341
You left this camp

01:55:30.549 --> 01:55:33.177
and established your own line.

01:55:33.386 --> 01:55:35.513
You must be responsible
for yourself

01:55:35.721 --> 01:55:38.140
and the decisions you made.

01:55:44.814 --> 01:55:46.273
We'll take her back to our camp.

01:55:48.025 --> 01:55:51.529
There, by canaanite custom,

01:55:51.737 --> 01:55:53.072
she must die.

01:56:00.204 --> 01:56:01.705
We leave at first light.

01:56:03.791 --> 01:56:05.251
(Man) Fine-looking flock.

01:56:05.459 --> 01:56:07.819
Well, there is rumor there's
some outbreak of fever among...

01:56:33.362 --> 01:56:34.864
So what do you have? A knife?

01:56:35.072 --> 01:56:37.908
You think that by killing me,
you can save your own life?

01:56:39.118 --> 01:56:41.620
You do me a favor, whore!

01:56:41.829 --> 01:56:43.622
By trying to spill my blood,

01:56:43.831 --> 01:56:46.542
you justify my own decision
to see you executed.

01:57:04.143 --> 01:57:05.227
You?

01:57:05.436 --> 01:57:08.481
I only did it
because I wanted a child,

01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:10.566
this child
that is rightfully mine.

01:57:10.774 --> 01:57:13.736
A son to continue
the name of my husband er,

01:57:13.944 --> 01:57:16.739
your own son and firstborn.

01:57:16.947 --> 01:57:20.159
But you didn't give Selah
to me when he came of age

01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:21.911
as you should have done.

01:57:23.412 --> 01:57:26.790
You're a very
courageous girl, tamar.

01:57:27.917 --> 01:57:31.420
But not brave enough
to... to face death.

01:57:31.629 --> 01:57:33.756
That won't happen.

01:57:33.964 --> 01:57:36.050
I have enough to answer for.

01:57:36.258 --> 01:57:39.136
The crime of taking your life
for something I have done

01:57:39.345 --> 01:57:40.971
is more than I can bear.

01:57:43.057 --> 01:57:45.809
You were right and I was wrong.

01:57:46.018 --> 01:57:48.437
I should have
given you to Selah.

01:57:48.646 --> 01:57:51.232
The only sin there is
belongs to me.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.069
You will live to have your child

01:57:55.277 --> 01:57:57.238
and raise him
as a mother should,

01:57:58.948 --> 01:58:01.617
living in your own tent,

01:58:01.825 --> 01:58:03.869
with respect

01:58:04.036 --> 01:58:05.120
and love.

01:58:10.042 --> 01:58:12.086
[Sobbing]

01:58:26.976 --> 01:58:29.728
[Knocking]

01:58:45.369 --> 01:58:48.163
Pay heed as the god ra
walks among you.

01:58:48.372 --> 01:58:52.418
Pay heed to the pharaoh,
sun of the heavens,

01:58:52.626 --> 01:58:54.545
ra incarnate.

01:59:26.619 --> 01:59:28.078
(Potiphar) The pharaoh is ra.

01:59:28.287 --> 01:59:30.247
(Courtiers) Ra is the pharaoh!

01:59:30.456 --> 01:59:34.084
As the god ra fills
the heavens with the sun,

01:59:34.293 --> 01:59:38.881
so the pharaoh ra on earth
does the same here below.

01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:43.093
Potiphar, the gods
must be blinding you.

01:59:43.302 --> 01:59:45.471
A fool can see I shed no light.

01:59:45.679 --> 01:59:47.389
The pharaoh is not well.

01:59:47.598 --> 01:59:49.099
Physician, attend
the god on earth!

01:59:49.308 --> 01:59:51.852
It's not my body that ails!

01:59:53.103 --> 01:59:54.980
If you knew your signs, vizier,

01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:58.108
you'd see it's my heart
that weighs me down.

01:59:58.317 --> 02:00:00.569
I'm beginning to wonder
if you know your art.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:04.490
If the pharaoh is in pain,
then let him speak of it,

02:00:04.698 --> 02:00:06.825
and the answer will be his.

02:00:09.036 --> 02:00:09.787
(Pharaoh) Dreams.

02:00:10.037 --> 02:00:11.580
I am haunted by dreams.

02:00:13.207 --> 02:00:15.209
I dreamt...

02:00:16.835 --> 02:00:19.213
I dreamt I was
in the great river,

02:00:19.421 --> 02:00:22.341
communing with my spirit
in the heavens.

02:00:23.759 --> 02:00:26.553
Near me were seven

02:00:26.762 --> 02:00:30.974
wonderfully fat
and gentle water cows,

02:00:31.183 --> 02:00:34.561
who seemed to
float along with me.

02:00:34.770 --> 02:00:36.438
It was serene.

02:00:36.647 --> 02:00:37.731
So very serene.

02:00:40.025 --> 02:00:41.860
But we were not alone.

02:00:42.069 --> 02:00:46.615
Horrible, starving cows
suddenly appeared,

02:00:46.824 --> 02:00:50.869
and the thin, wretched cows
ate the sleek, fat cows.

02:00:52.287 --> 02:00:54.498
I woke in a cold sweat

02:00:54.707 --> 02:00:57.793
and, to my horror,

02:00:58.001 --> 02:01:00.212
when I finally
got back to sleep,

02:01:00.421 --> 02:01:03.841
I had a second dream
just as frightening.

02:01:04.049 --> 02:01:06.051
In this dream,

02:01:06.260 --> 02:01:08.762
there were seven
plump ears of corn

02:01:08.971 --> 02:01:12.766
growing on a stalk.

02:01:12.975 --> 02:01:17.229
Then, seven blighted ears,

02:01:17.438 --> 02:01:21.108
meager and scorched
by the east wind,

02:01:21.316 --> 02:01:25.279
sprouted teeth
and devoured the good ears.

02:01:25.487 --> 02:01:27.156
What can these dreams
possibly mean?

02:01:27.364 --> 02:01:29.450
They can't be a good sign.

02:01:30.242 --> 02:01:32.035
Let us begin.

02:01:54.224 --> 02:01:55.893
A cup of wine.

02:02:27.132 --> 02:02:32.346
Majesty, as might be expected
from the messages to god,

02:02:32.554 --> 02:02:35.057
there is a balance
in these holy dreams.

02:02:35.265 --> 02:02:38.060
First, the sacred
life-giving nile,

02:02:38.268 --> 02:02:41.563
and then the divine presence of
the omnipotent pharaoh himself.

02:02:41.772 --> 02:02:44.399
The healthy cows
and the lean cows.

02:02:44.608 --> 02:02:47.361
The ripe ears
and then the unripe ears.

02:02:47.569 --> 02:02:51.156
I know what was in the dreams!
I had them!

02:02:51.365 --> 02:02:53.617
Your job is to tell me
what they mean.

02:02:53.826 --> 02:02:57.371
We-we do not know, majesty.

02:03:04.586 --> 02:03:06.129
[Whispers]
How can you remain silent

02:03:06.338 --> 02:03:09.299
when you know there is a man who
can ease your pharaoh's mind?

02:03:09.508 --> 02:03:11.218
I dare not, master.

02:03:11.426 --> 02:03:12.845
The pharaoh's mood is black.

02:03:13.053 --> 02:03:15.681
I dare not remind him that
I was ever in his disfavor.

02:03:15.889 --> 02:03:18.642
Come on, man. Don't be a fool.

02:03:18.851 --> 02:03:21.979
But I am a humble
wine-bearer, master.

02:03:22.187 --> 02:03:24.857
It is for you, potiphar,
the chief steward.

02:03:25.065 --> 02:03:27.025
It is for you to speak up.

02:03:28.068 --> 02:03:30.070
(Pharaoh) More wine!

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:40.122
May I speak with you, pharaoh?

02:03:40.330 --> 02:03:42.374
Only so others may not hear.

02:03:49.631 --> 02:03:52.259
[Inaudible]

02:03:53.719 --> 02:03:56.346
You'd have the dreams
of your pharaoh

02:03:56.555 --> 02:03:59.558
interpreted by an alien slave?

02:03:59.766 --> 02:04:01.977
(Potiphar)
Sire? The semite slave

02:04:02.185 --> 02:04:06.481
interpreted both this man's
dreams and that of the baker.

02:04:06.690 --> 02:04:09.776
He saw the pharaoh's hand
in our dreams

02:04:09.985 --> 02:04:12.362
and predicted
his judgments accurately.

02:04:18.452 --> 02:04:22.372
Well, this slave of yours,
how is he called?

02:04:22.581 --> 02:04:24.499
Joseph, sire.

02:04:25.792 --> 02:04:29.713
Bring me Joseph, the semite,
from the dungeon,

02:04:29.922 --> 02:04:32.215
and tell him nothing
about my dreams.

02:04:41.558 --> 02:04:43.268
[Door opens]

02:04:43.477 --> 02:04:44.603
What is this?

02:04:45.938 --> 02:04:48.732
I order you to speak!

02:04:48.941 --> 02:04:51.193
What are you doing?

02:04:51.401 --> 02:04:52.444
Please.

02:04:54.029 --> 02:04:55.989
What have I done?

02:05:06.667 --> 02:05:08.585
[Laughs]

02:05:20.639 --> 02:05:22.474
Lie prostrate. Quick.

02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:26.269
I cannot. You know that.

02:05:26.478 --> 02:05:28.814
You what?

02:05:29.022 --> 02:05:32.442
Truly, the pharaoh
is greatness itself,

02:05:32.651 --> 02:05:34.152
but, sire, my faith decrees

02:05:34.361 --> 02:05:37.280
I can kneel only
before god himself.

02:05:37.489 --> 02:05:40.158
Even on pain of death.

02:05:40.367 --> 02:05:42.077
[Laughing]

02:05:44.538 --> 02:05:45.872
Come forward.

02:05:49.167 --> 02:05:50.752
(Pharaoh) Take heed, magicians.

02:05:50.961 --> 02:05:51.961
Whatever else,

02:05:52.004 --> 02:05:55.132
I know this man won't lie to me
to save his life.

02:06:01.138 --> 02:06:03.098
Look upon my face.

02:06:06.518 --> 02:06:09.688
But surely, great pharaoh,
this is forbidden.

02:06:09.896 --> 02:06:12.983
Only to people who know I'm god.

02:06:13.191 --> 02:06:16.945
Since you hold some primitive
being in higher regard,

02:06:17.154 --> 02:06:20.532
I expect that you can look upon
me without burning up.

02:06:20.741 --> 02:06:21.950
Try it.

02:06:32.627 --> 02:06:35.422
I'm told you've learned
the secret of reading messages

02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:36.298
of the night.

02:06:36.506 --> 02:06:39.801
Interpreting dreams is not
a thing to be learned, pharaoh.

02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:41.053
It is a gift from god.

02:06:41.261 --> 02:06:45.140
Careful! One mention
too many of this god,

02:06:45.348 --> 02:06:48.685
and you'll be at his side
with your head under your arm!

02:06:48.894 --> 02:06:51.855
So, you've been given this gift?

02:06:53.273 --> 02:06:55.901
I imagine we
shall soon see, pharaoh.

02:06:57.027 --> 02:06:58.111
Your life...

02:06:59.488 --> 02:07:02.032
Depends upon what we shall see.

02:07:03.658 --> 02:07:06.411
Now listen carefully.

02:07:06.620 --> 02:07:08.580
In my dream...

02:07:09.873 --> 02:07:13.585
There were seven cows,
fat and sleek,

02:07:13.794 --> 02:07:15.670
and they grazed peacefully...

02:07:15.879 --> 02:07:17.714
He's a very beautiful boy.

02:07:17.923 --> 02:07:20.425
Yes, he is.

02:07:20.634 --> 02:07:22.886
Do you know what his crime was?

02:07:23.095 --> 02:07:26.556
I've heard the rumors,
but I don't believe it.

02:07:26.765 --> 02:07:29.392
He doesn't strike me as a fool,

02:07:29.601 --> 02:07:32.896
and everyone knows that
potiphar's wife deceives him.

02:07:34.272 --> 02:07:37.859
I've never seen such poor cows
in all of Egypt.

02:07:38.068 --> 02:07:41.113
But it was impossible to tell
they had eaten the fat cows

02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:43.406
for they looked
as wretched as ever.

02:07:45.242 --> 02:07:48.078
Was there a second dream?

02:07:48.286 --> 02:07:49.579
[Courtiers murmur]

02:07:49.788 --> 02:07:52.457
We have told him nothing, sire.

02:07:53.625 --> 02:07:54.625
Yes.

02:07:56.044 --> 02:07:57.754
In the second dream,

02:07:57.963 --> 02:08:01.424
there were seven ears of grain,
beautifully ripe.

02:08:01.633 --> 02:08:04.094
Then, sprouting up behind them,

02:08:04.302 --> 02:08:07.013
were seven withered ears
of grain which devoured

02:08:07.222 --> 02:08:08.557
the ripe ones.

02:08:19.359 --> 02:08:22.654
God has revealed to pharaoh
what he intends to do.

02:08:22.863 --> 02:08:24.197
Yes?

02:08:24.406 --> 02:08:26.575
Pharaoh's dreams
are one in the same.

02:08:26.783 --> 02:08:29.911
The seven fine cows and
seven ripe ears of grain

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:32.747
represent seven years of plenty.

02:08:32.956 --> 02:08:36.418
The seven wretched cows and
seven shriveled ears of grain

02:08:36.626 --> 02:08:38.670
are years of great want.

02:08:40.463 --> 02:08:44.217
There will be seven years
of famine, my lord.

02:08:45.468 --> 02:08:46.595
Madness.

02:08:49.306 --> 02:08:51.516
Madness!

02:08:51.725 --> 02:08:55.395
As if my brother, the sun,
and sister, the moon,

02:08:55.604 --> 02:08:59.191
would send me messages
only a slave could read!

02:08:59.399 --> 02:09:01.902
Pofiphan take him from my sight!

02:09:02.110 --> 02:09:04.321
Get him back to his dungeon
and keep him there

02:09:04.529 --> 02:09:06.781
until I decide
how best to deal with him.

02:09:27.469 --> 02:09:29.471
No!

02:09:29.679 --> 02:09:30.679
(Pharaoh) No!

02:09:36.186 --> 02:09:38.230
No!

02:09:44.402 --> 02:09:48.073
Husband, another dream
to ruin all our sleep?

02:09:50.659 --> 02:09:52.244
No, the same one.

02:09:53.954 --> 02:09:55.872
This is too important to ignore.

02:09:57.457 --> 02:09:59.376
I'm lost, wife.

02:10:00.919 --> 02:10:01.919
Help me.

02:10:02.921 --> 02:10:05.674
Me? And risk your anger?

02:10:05.882 --> 02:10:08.343
No, I'll keep
my own counsel, my lord.

02:10:11.763 --> 02:10:14.557
Asenath here,
on the other hand...

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:16.600
Yes.

02:10:20.438 --> 02:10:22.357
Let me guess.

02:10:23.984 --> 02:10:26.695
She's so taken
with this foreign slave.

02:10:26.903 --> 02:10:31.116
Oh, yes. Nothing escapes
pharaoh's eye, young woman.

02:10:41.918 --> 02:10:44.129
She thinks he has the answer.

02:10:48.675 --> 02:10:50.468
By your own word, lord,

02:10:50.677 --> 02:10:53.471
we know he does nothing
against his conscience,

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.557
even on pain of death.

02:10:56.433 --> 02:11:00.312
And you, yourself, seem
reluctant to see him hanged.

02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:05.233
There must be a reason
you held your mighty hand,

02:11:05.442 --> 02:11:08.153
spared him to live
to see another day.

02:11:15.952 --> 02:11:17.120
[Clapping]

02:11:22.584 --> 02:11:25.795
I've thought long and hard
of your reading of my messages.

02:11:26.004 --> 02:11:27.881
Have you?

02:11:28.089 --> 02:11:29.089
Yes, master.

02:11:29.257 --> 02:11:31.009
(Pharaoh) And?

02:11:31.217 --> 02:11:33.720
I am certain that pharaoh
has been blessed by a warning

02:11:33.928 --> 02:11:35.096
from the lord himself.

02:11:37.932 --> 02:11:38.932
So...

02:11:39.392 --> 02:11:42.270
Assume then that
your reading is accurate.

02:11:42.479 --> 02:11:46.483
Is there nothing we can do
to prevent this disaster?

02:11:47.525 --> 02:11:49.569
Yes, master, there is.

02:11:50.779 --> 02:11:52.113
How?

02:11:52.322 --> 02:11:53.922
Pharaoh must select
a wise and honest man

02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:56.868
and set him above
the land of Egypt.

02:11:57.160 --> 02:11:58.953
He must see that
pharaoh's overseers

02:11:59.162 --> 02:12:01.581
collect a fifth of all
that is produced during

02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:02.790
the years of plenty

02:12:02.999 --> 02:12:05.210
and store it for use
during the years of famine.

02:12:05.919 --> 02:12:08.505
In that way, Egypt will not be
destroyed by the drought.

02:12:09.089 --> 02:12:12.175
Impossible, storing
seven years of grain.

02:12:13.051 --> 02:12:14.051
It's impossible.

02:12:15.136 --> 02:12:17.764
Is there no other way
to avert disaster?

02:12:18.765 --> 02:12:20.308
No, master.

02:12:20.892 --> 02:12:23.353
Nothing like this
has ever been attempted.

02:12:24.521 --> 02:12:27.524
So, a fifth of all the harvest

02:12:27.732 --> 02:12:30.151
would be entrusted to pharaoh.

02:12:30.610 --> 02:12:31.610
Yes, master.

02:12:31.903 --> 02:12:34.656
All Egypt would be required
to pay you this tribute.

02:12:37.617 --> 02:12:41.454
It would call for a man
of exceptional talent.

02:12:47.252 --> 02:12:49.587
That excludes each of you!

02:12:56.970 --> 02:12:59.097
Potiphar, perhaps.

02:12:59.305 --> 02:13:02.058
[Courtiers murmur]

02:13:07.105 --> 02:13:09.274
The answer is obvious.

02:13:09.482 --> 02:13:12.485
There could be
no better man for this job...

02:13:13.987 --> 02:13:16.072
Than this man himself.

02:13:16.281 --> 02:13:17.866
[Courtiers muttering]

02:13:23.872 --> 02:13:28.835
Can we find anyone endowed with
the spirit of god as he is?

02:13:32.255 --> 02:13:34.382
I think not.

02:13:35.758 --> 02:13:37.510
Well said, wife.

02:13:38.553 --> 02:13:40.263
Now, hear the word of pharaoh,

02:13:40.472 --> 02:13:43.266
ra on earth, god as man.

02:13:44.976 --> 02:13:47.228
You shall be my chancellor.

02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.776
And all my people
shall respect your orders.

02:13:55.570 --> 02:13:59.032
Only this throne
shall set me above you.

02:14:02.785 --> 02:14:05.497
I make you the governor

02:14:05.705 --> 02:14:07.415
of all of Egypt.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.294
I set you over my house,

02:14:11.503 --> 02:14:13.421
my people...

02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:16.382
My entire kingdom.

02:14:16.591 --> 02:14:20.553
Without your consent, no man
shall lift up hand or foot

02:14:20.762 --> 02:14:23.014
in all of Egypt.

02:14:23.223 --> 02:14:24.766
Your name shall be...

02:14:28.436 --> 02:14:30.438
Zaphenath-paneah.

02:14:38.279 --> 02:14:42.158
And this fine woman
shall be your wife.

02:14:55.588 --> 02:14:57.799
The pharaoh is ra.

02:14:58.007 --> 02:15:00.009
He sees into the depths
of every being.

02:15:00.218 --> 02:15:02.720
God has seen and spoken.

02:15:02.929 --> 02:15:05.390
(Courtiers) Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:05.598 --> 02:15:07.100
Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:07.308 --> 02:15:09.894
Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:10.103 --> 02:15:13.481
This time your god's blessing
makes you master,

02:15:13.690 --> 02:15:14.440
even of me.

02:15:14.649 --> 02:15:16.192
(Couriers) Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:16.401 --> 02:15:18.736
Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.490
I trust you'll treat me kindly.

02:15:22.699 --> 02:15:24.701
(Courtiers) Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:24.951 --> 02:15:25.951
Pharaoh is ra!

02:15:26.035 --> 02:15:31.624
Pharaoh is ra! Pharaoh is ra!

Pharaoh is ra! Pharaoh is ra!

What is your name?

02:15:45.221 --> 02:15:46.598
Asenath.

02:15:46.806 --> 02:15:49.559
I'm the daughter of
the high priest of on.

02:15:49.767 --> 02:15:52.103
Excuse me, but what
is my name... my new name?

02:15:52.312 --> 02:15:53.312
I have forgotten it.

02:15:53.438 --> 02:15:55.523
Zaphenath-paneah.

02:15:55.732 --> 02:15:57.442

02:15:57.650 --> 02:15:58.818
What does it mean?

02:15:59.027 --> 02:16:00.695
The savior.

02:16:00.903 --> 02:16:02.780
The savior?
Am I pleasing to you?

02:16:02.989 --> 02:16:04.198
Yes, yes.

02:16:06.034 --> 02:16:07.035
Greatly.

02:16:47.742 --> 02:16:48.785
I'm sorry.

Zaphenath-paneah.

02:16:51.037 --> 02:16:54.499
In this great task, you'll need
someone at your side

02:16:54.707 --> 02:16:56.584
as you were once at mine.

02:17:01.589 --> 02:17:03.549
To serve thee, master,

02:17:03.758 --> 02:17:05.550
would be a high honor...

02:17:06.593 --> 02:17:09.180
But my sins
against you are many.

02:17:09.388 --> 02:17:11.599
On your feet, ednan.

02:17:15.436 --> 02:17:18.189
Forgiveness is
greater than vengeance.

02:17:19.523 --> 02:17:21.776
Compassion
more powerful than anger.

02:17:23.861 --> 02:17:26.197
As I myself have learned.

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:32.704
May your god watch over you.

02:17:33.955 --> 02:17:35.373
Like all Egypt,

02:17:35.581 --> 02:17:37.458
my life depends on it.

02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:41.087
Go now.

02:17:44.799 --> 02:17:46.259
Go.

02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:35.910
My son.

02:19:40.206 --> 02:19:43.334
How fortunate a child to
have so beautiful a mother.

[Cooing]

02:19:49.215 --> 02:19:51.801
Have you decided
on a name for your son?

02:19:52.009 --> 02:19:54.095
He shall be called manasseh,

02:19:55.805 --> 02:19:58.683
which in my tongue means
"causing to forget."

02:20:00.518 --> 02:20:03.688
And god has made me
forget my hardship.

02:20:03.896 --> 02:20:07.149
I doubt that you've forgotten
the house of your father,

02:20:07.358 --> 02:20:08.358
Joseph.

02:20:11.237 --> 02:20:13.364
Jacob would be pleased
to learn his son

02:20:13.573 --> 02:20:16.659
has become the second most
powerful man in the world.

02:20:18.286 --> 02:20:19.996
And your beloved
brother Benjamin

02:20:20.204 --> 02:20:21.622
would be pleased as well.

02:20:24.125 --> 02:20:27.044
I wonder what sort of man
Benjamin has become.

02:20:28.838 --> 02:20:31.132
Perhaps he, too, has a son.

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:34.468
But it's not for me to know.

02:20:34.677 --> 02:20:35.677
Not yet.

02:20:35.803 --> 02:20:38.556
God in his own good time
will decide.

but the rains
didn't last long enough.

02:21:23.935 --> 02:21:26.062
If it goes on like this,

02:21:26.270 --> 02:21:29.023
there'll be no crop
to speak of this year.

The Wells are clogging,
but they'll hold.

02:23:22.887 --> 02:23:25.139
And for a while, at any rate,
there'll be water to drink,

02:23:25.473 --> 02:23:26.974
but the grain runs low.

02:23:27.475 --> 02:23:29.395
Two, maybe three phases
of the moon, and we'll be

02:23:29.518 --> 02:23:30.518
forced to eat the animals

02:23:30.603 --> 02:23:32.313
instead of feeding them.

02:23:32.521 --> 02:23:34.190
Once they are gone, father...

02:23:34.398 --> 02:23:36.567

and the animals...

Well, hirah,
my old friend and ally,

02:23:45.367 --> 02:23:47.578
says that the reports
of vast stocks of grain and

fodder in Egypt are true.

02:23:49.205 --> 02:23:51.624
Which is all well
and good for the Egyptians,

02:23:51.832 --> 02:23:54.085
but why should they care
what happens to us?

02:23:54.293 --> 02:23:55.293
(Judah) They don't.

02:23:55.377 --> 02:23:58.047
But according to hirah, they do
care what happens to our money.

He's already sent his caravan
laden with silver and

02:24:00.633 --> 02:24:01.633
loom work to trade.

02:24:01.675 --> 02:24:04.762
As if an Egyptian trader
can be trusted!

[Indistinct clamoring]

02:24:09.391 --> 02:24:12.561
It's not in the hands
of private traders!

02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:16.065
Their pharaoh has set one man
above all others to supervise

02:24:16.273 --> 02:24:18.150
his affairs. You deal with him.

02:24:19.944 --> 02:24:23.489
We are not people who measure
our wealth in silver.

02:24:23.697 --> 02:24:25.157
We can't carry fields to Egypt!

02:24:25.407 --> 02:24:27.284
The animals would die
before we got there!

02:24:27.493 --> 02:24:28.577
We'd better move eastward.

02:24:28.786 --> 02:24:31.122
Asher, don't interrupt!

02:24:32.206 --> 02:24:34.208
Over the years,

02:24:34.416 --> 02:24:37.086
the tribe has earned
some silver and gold.

02:24:37.294 --> 02:24:40.381
I've kept it because I believed
that one day god would show us

02:24:40.589 --> 02:24:41.257
a use for it.

02:24:41.465 --> 02:24:43.717
Could there be
a better use than this?

02:24:43.926 --> 02:24:45.845
No, I think not.

02:24:47.054 --> 02:24:48.430
But it's a long trek,

02:24:48.639 --> 02:24:50.119
and the roads are
filled with thieves.

02:24:50.182 --> 02:24:52.184
Which is why you must all go.

02:24:52.768 --> 02:24:55.396
Properly armed, you'll find
there's safety in numbers.

02:24:56.605 --> 02:24:57.731
All of us?

02:24:57.940 --> 02:24:59.942
And who will
tend to things here?

02:25:00.151 --> 02:25:02.987
There'll be nothing to tend
if you don't go.

02:25:03.696 --> 02:25:04.864
(Jacob) All of you...

02:25:06.866 --> 02:25:08.701
Except for Benjamin.
But, father...

02:25:08.909 --> 02:25:09.618
Enough.

02:25:09.827 --> 02:25:11.227
You're the last link
to Rachel left.

02:25:11.412 --> 02:25:14.623
I will not see you lost
as I did Joseph.

02:25:15.749 --> 02:25:16.749
Prepare the animals.

02:25:16.834 --> 02:25:18.502
You leave at nightfall.

02:25:20.254 --> 02:25:21.547
I'll give you the silver then.

02:25:31.432 --> 02:25:33.559
First he raised Joseph above us,

02:25:33.767 --> 02:25:35.561
now Benjamin.

02:25:35.769 --> 02:25:37.730
Then so be it!

02:25:37.938 --> 02:25:40.733
We'll not tease god
a second time.

02:25:45.696 --> 02:25:48.449
[Clamoring]

02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:19.563
[Men speaking aramaic]

02:26:28.072 --> 02:26:29.323
[Man shouting aramaic]

[Shouting continues]

02:26:53.430 --> 02:26:54.598
Ednan!

02:26:54.807 --> 02:26:56.807
Yes, master. It's just...
Well, this man's dialect.

02:26:56.976 --> 02:26:58.328
I know the tongue...
(Joseph) Never mind.

02:26:58.352 --> 02:26:59.937
Give him what he needs.

02:27:00.145 --> 02:27:01.939
[Ednan sighs]

02:27:04.358 --> 02:27:05.693
Go. Go!

02:27:13.993 --> 02:27:15.703
Are you well, zaphenath-paneah?

02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:17.329
They're here.

02:27:17.538 --> 02:27:19.540
I'm sure they're here.

02:27:19.748 --> 02:27:21.583
Who?

02:27:21.792 --> 02:27:23.669
My brothers.

02:27:26.797 --> 02:27:27.423
Your brothers?

02:27:27.631 --> 02:27:30.050
The ones in canaanite dress.

02:27:30.259 --> 02:27:32.177
What should I do, master?

02:27:35.889 --> 02:27:37.599
Bring them to me.

02:27:41.478 --> 02:27:42.563
You, you, you!

02:27:42.771 --> 02:27:44.023
Come, all of you, come!

02:27:46.775 --> 02:27:48.902
This way. Bring them all!

02:27:49.445 --> 02:27:50.445
All of these men!

02:27:51.155 --> 02:27:52.906
(Ednan) You, you, come! And you!

02:28:07.713 --> 02:28:09.089
Lift your heads!

02:28:09.882 --> 02:28:11.759
Look upon your master.

02:28:30.944 --> 02:28:32.654
[Whispering]
They don't even recognize me.

02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:35.032
Oh, mighty one, have mercy.

02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:38.270
(Reuben)
We come from canaan where

02:28:38.452 --> 02:28:40.204
the drought destroys everything.

02:28:40.996 --> 02:28:43.749
We bring silver to trade...

02:28:43.999 --> 02:28:47.419
So that we and our families
might survive.

02:28:47.628 --> 02:28:49.880
[Whispering]

02:28:51.673 --> 02:28:54.760
Your master,
zaphenath-paneah, asks why

02:28:54.968 --> 02:28:57.304
your canaanite gods
do not provide for your needs.

02:28:57.513 --> 02:29:01.016
We're not like the other
canaanites, great master.

02:29:01.225 --> 02:29:03.936
[Whispering]
We worship our own god.

02:29:04.144 --> 02:29:07.731
But we sojourn
in the land of canaan.

[Murmuring]

02:29:12.986 --> 02:29:14.113
Spies?

02:29:14.321 --> 02:29:17.908
No, master.
Our father sent us to buy food.

02:29:18.117 --> 02:29:19.159
[Whispers]

02:29:20.577 --> 02:29:23.539
The master says no,
you are spies,

02:29:23.747 --> 02:29:25.374
sent to see
the weakness of Egypt.

02:29:25.624 --> 02:29:27.751
No, master. We are
nothing more than Shepherds,

02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:29.753
sons of Jacob, the son of Isaac.

02:29:29.962 --> 02:29:30.962
[Whispers]

02:29:32.673 --> 02:29:34.633
What man would send all his sons

02:29:34.842 --> 02:29:37.761
on such a mission
and leave himself alone?

02:29:42.474 --> 02:29:45.561
What you see are
not all his sons.

02:29:45.769 --> 02:29:47.312
One other...

02:29:48.355 --> 02:29:50.315
The youngest...

02:29:50.524 --> 02:29:53.527
- He is called Benjamin.
- -Remains with our father.

02:29:55.863 --> 02:29:59.366
A man is fortunate, indeed,
to have such a wealth of sons.

02:29:59.575 --> 02:30:03.245
Are you sure you speak
the truth of your number?

02:30:04.413 --> 02:30:07.833
There was one other, master.

02:30:08.041 --> 02:30:10.085
A brother called Joseph,

02:30:10.294 --> 02:30:11.587
but he was taken from us.

02:30:11.795 --> 02:30:13.422
[Whispers] ."Joseph?

02:30:25.142 --> 02:30:26.351
(Simeon) What enemy would send

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:28.812
ten brothers as spies?

02:30:29.021 --> 02:30:31.315
One or two perhaps, but ten?!

02:30:32.691 --> 02:30:35.152
Take them! Now! Take them!

02:31:14.733 --> 02:31:16.652
Why us? There were hundreds
there today,

02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:19.446
and the Egyptians picked us out
to be spies!

02:31:19.655 --> 02:31:21.532
There must be some way
to prove he's wrong!

02:31:21.740 --> 02:31:23.951
What would you suggest,
little brother?

02:31:24.159 --> 02:31:26.519
We probably wouldn't be here
if you'd paid him more respect!

02:31:26.703 --> 02:31:28.038
Oh, leave it alone!

02:31:28.247 --> 02:31:31.458
"One or two brothers perhaps,
but ten?"

02:31:31.667 --> 02:31:33.794
What kind of fool would use
an excuse like that?!

Stop it! Stop it!

[Yelling ceases]

02:31:36.713 --> 02:31:38.257
Arguing won't get us
out of here.

02:31:38.465 --> 02:31:40.509
Then what will?
Not what, but who!

02:31:40.717 --> 02:31:42.219
God!

02:31:42.427 --> 02:31:45.055
Is this his final punishment
for what we did?

02:31:45.264 --> 02:31:46.264
(Men) No!

02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:47.742

must've felt

02:31:47.766 --> 02:31:49.142
when we threw him down the well!

02:31:49.351 --> 02:31:50.561
Not quite!

02:31:50.769 --> 02:31:53.438

You left him alone!

"Youâ€œ? We! "You"? We!

We put him in the well.

There's no point
in dwelling on that!

For 20 years you've
harped on the same thing!

But what's done is done!

And one thing has nothing
to do with another!

Are you sure, brother?

02:32:09.913 --> 02:32:10.974

that's wonderful.

they'd come to you.

from the troubles.

You would have been
disappointed.

I've waited all these years,

02:33:19.691 --> 02:33:22.611
and then they
didn't even recognize me.

02:33:22.819 --> 02:33:24.696
How can that be possible?

02:33:24.905 --> 02:33:28.158
It's been over 20 years
since they last saw me.

02:33:28.367 --> 02:33:29.368
I was still a boy.

02:33:30.410 --> 02:33:31.578
Not surprising.

02:33:34.206 --> 02:33:35.666
Where are they now?

02:33:36.458 --> 02:33:37.668
In the prison.

[Laughing]

02:33:56.061 --> 02:33:57.854
In the prison?

02:33:58.438 --> 02:33:59.606
Why?

02:34:00.607 --> 02:34:04.236
Because my anger was stronger
than my compassion.

02:34:08.031 --> 02:34:10.742
And what will you do with them?

02:34:10.951 --> 02:34:12.744
My father's people
are in need of food.

02:34:12.953 --> 02:34:14.871
I must send them back.

02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:17.708
Why not just reveal
yourself to them?

02:34:17.916 --> 02:34:19.751
Because they seem unchanged.

02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:23.547
No different
from when they betrayed me.

02:34:25.632 --> 02:34:28.343
Perhaps, god will reveal
a way to test them.

02:34:28.552 --> 02:34:30.345
How?

02:34:30.554 --> 02:34:32.848
I'm not sure.

02:34:36.518 --> 02:34:37.686
Well,

02:34:37.894 --> 02:34:41.815
I want to see these men
to whom I owe my happiness.

02:34:42.023 --> 02:34:43.400
After all,

02:34:43.608 --> 02:34:46.027
it was their cruelty
that brought you here,

02:34:46.236 --> 02:34:47.654
gave you to me,

02:34:47.863 --> 02:34:50.282
saved Egypt.

02:34:50.490 --> 02:34:55.162
And it's to them our children
owe their existence.

02:34:56.955 --> 02:34:59.833
Another of your
curious insights.

02:35:01.626 --> 02:35:04.921
But I'm not so sure god is ready
to see this thing forgotten.

02:35:05.130 --> 02:35:07.549
God? Or you?

02:35:09.885 --> 02:35:11.470
You must bring them.

02:35:11.678 --> 02:35:15.015
I have to at least
meet little Benjamin.

02:35:15.223 --> 02:35:17.851
Benjamin was left
with my father.

02:35:18.059 --> 02:35:19.102
I'm sorry.

02:35:21.938 --> 02:35:23.940
I know he's the one
who counted most.

02:35:26.610 --> 02:35:28.653
But they are all your brothers.

02:35:28.862 --> 02:35:30.197
Blood of your blood.

02:35:38.663 --> 02:35:41.082
(Ednan)
Your master zaphenath-paneah

02:35:41.291 --> 02:35:45.212
will allow you to buy the grain
you need to feed your people.

02:35:45.420 --> 02:35:48.298
These sacks have provisions
for your journey.

02:35:48.507 --> 02:35:51.426
But the accusations
against you still stand.

02:35:51.635 --> 02:35:53.762
Evidence that your story is true

02:35:53.970 --> 02:35:55.639
and you're not spies

02:35:55.847 --> 02:35:58.058
will depend upon proof
of the existence

02:35:58.266 --> 02:35:59.935
of the one missing brother.

02:36:00.143 --> 02:36:02.020
But your master,
zaphenath-paneah,

02:36:02.229 --> 02:36:04.648
is a merciful man.

02:36:04.856 --> 02:36:07.901
Thus, he will keep
only one of you here.

02:36:08.109 --> 02:36:10.487
He will be released
when the rest of you return

02:36:10.695 --> 02:36:12.364
from canaan with that brother.

02:36:12.572 --> 02:36:14.616
You wish us to return
to our father,

02:36:14.825 --> 02:36:17.118
then journey
once again to Egypt?

02:36:17.327 --> 02:36:20.205
Yes, with the missing brother.

02:36:22.791 --> 02:36:24.251
That one shall remain with us.

02:36:24.459 --> 02:36:26.461
No! No! No!

02:36:26.670 --> 02:36:28.088
(Ednan) Now, go!

02:36:28.296 --> 02:36:30.173
Leave!

02:36:48.859 --> 02:36:50.193
(Ednan) And return swiftly

02:36:50.402 --> 02:36:51.862
with the missing brother.

02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:55.031
You've probably seen
the last of them, master.

02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:58.410
It will be difficult
for them to keep away.

02:36:58.618 --> 02:37:01.496
The drought has just begun.

02:37:01.705 --> 02:37:05.083
The silver they gave in payment.
Did you do what I asked?

02:37:05.500 --> 02:37:06.626
As ever, master.

02:37:16.052 --> 02:37:18.305
[Donkey braying]

02:37:36.615 --> 02:37:39.451
[Donkey braying]

02:37:42.495 --> 02:37:44.998
There's some water
here at least!

02:37:45.665 --> 02:37:48.126
We camp here tonight!

02:37:51.713 --> 02:37:54.883
Issachar! Issachar!

02:37:55.091 --> 02:37:58.887
Open your bag of grain
and feed the animals!

02:38:04.100 --> 02:38:06.061
[Donkey braying]

02:38:06.269 --> 02:38:07.269
What's this?

02:38:09.689 --> 02:38:13.234
The silver I used
to buy the grain.

02:38:13.443 --> 02:38:17.322
What kind of game
is god playing with us now?

02:38:20.116 --> 02:38:23.787
We can't stay here!
Feed the animals quickly!

02:38:23.995 --> 02:38:26.414
We'll travel through the night!

02:38:32.837 --> 02:38:35.215
(Child) Father!

02:38:35.423 --> 02:38:36.925
(Child 2) Father's home!

02:38:37.133 --> 02:38:39.594
(Child 3) Father's returned!

02:38:39.803 --> 02:38:42.013
Father! Father!

02:38:49.771 --> 02:38:51.106
Levi.

02:38:51.856 --> 02:38:52.856
Naphtali.

02:38:54.192 --> 02:38:55.235
No! But the only proof

02:38:55.443 --> 02:38:56.027
of our story

02:38:56.236 --> 02:38:57.612
he'll accept is Benjamin.

02:38:57.821 --> 02:39:00.323
And the only way
to redeem simeon.

02:39:00.532 --> 02:39:01.532
But after that,

02:39:01.658 --> 02:39:03.994
he promises we can
trade freely in Egypt.

02:39:04.202 --> 02:39:06.413
The grain is abundant,
the best quality.

02:39:06.621 --> 02:39:09.249
Is is all the Egyptian asks?

02:39:09.457 --> 02:39:11.918
Just for my youngest?

02:39:12.127 --> 02:39:14.045
Is there more
to this sorry tale?

02:39:17.549 --> 02:39:19.968
What is that?

02:39:20.176 --> 02:39:23.513
The money with which
we purchased the grain.

02:39:23.722 --> 02:39:26.141
What's it doing here?

02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:27.726
We don't know, father.

02:39:27.934 --> 02:39:29.060
Perhaps, god...

02:39:29.269 --> 02:39:32.188
Be careful what you lay
at the door of the lord.

02:39:32.397 --> 02:39:33.648
Blessed be his name.

02:39:33.857 --> 02:39:35.483
(Jacob's sons)
Blessed be his name.

02:39:35.692 --> 02:39:40.196
Now why? Why did you tell
this man I had another son?

02:39:40.405 --> 02:39:43.116
First I lose Joseph,
then simeon.

02:39:44.701 --> 02:39:46.286
And you,

02:39:46.494 --> 02:39:49.706
poorsoul
want me to give him Benjamin.

02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:52.959
Well, hear my words!
It will not happen.

02:39:53.168 --> 02:39:54.753
I will never,

02:39:54.961 --> 02:39:57.255
never risk Benjamin
to your care.

02:39:57.464 --> 02:39:58.464
Neveh

02:39:58.506 --> 02:40:01.009
but, father, simeon rots
in an Egyptian jail

02:40:01.217 --> 02:40:02.260
like a common criminal!

02:40:02.469 --> 02:40:04.804
How do I know Benjamin
won't meet that same fate?

02:40:05.013 --> 02:40:07.766
Or this Egyptian might
put you all to the sword?

02:40:07.974 --> 02:40:09.160
But, father, perhaps if I went...

02:40:09.184 --> 02:40:10.435
Quiet, you have no say in this.

02:40:10.643 --> 02:40:12.187
(Reuben) Father!

02:40:13.521 --> 02:40:15.940
I cannot leave simeon there.

02:40:16.983 --> 02:40:18.526
Please,

02:40:18.735 --> 02:40:22.030
let me do as
this Egyptian suggests.

02:40:22.238 --> 02:40:23.907
If we don't return,

02:40:24.115 --> 02:40:26.951
I offer you the lives
of my own two sons.

02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:30.163
A typical idea of yours, Reuben.

02:40:30.371 --> 02:40:32.499
If I lose Benjamin,
I can begin exterminating

02:40:32.707 --> 02:40:33.958
my entire family.

02:40:34.459 --> 02:40:36.628
Is that your grand solution?

02:40:36.878 --> 02:40:39.130
Now hear me!

02:40:39.339 --> 02:40:41.674
This is my last son by Rachel.

02:40:41.883 --> 02:40:44.928
I will not risk losing him.

02:40:45.136 --> 02:40:46.846
Now go about your business

02:40:47.055 --> 02:40:49.182
and pray.

02:40:49.390 --> 02:40:52.227
Pray that the grain
you brought back will

02:40:52.435 --> 02:40:53.436
outlast the drought.

02:40:57.899 --> 02:40:59.317
[Chattering]

02:41:04.697 --> 02:41:06.407
Nowhere to go, father.

02:41:06.616 --> 02:41:09.953
We don't have many choices left.

02:41:15.041 --> 02:41:16.709
You know my mind in this matter!

02:41:16.918 --> 02:41:19.129
We will not talk of it again!

02:41:22.715 --> 02:41:24.968
Another month and
we'll not talk of anything.

02:41:28.179 --> 02:41:31.141
(Leah) Soon we will all die.

02:41:31.349 --> 02:41:33.434
The line started by Abraham

02:41:33.643 --> 02:41:34.894
will have vanished.

02:41:37.063 --> 02:41:39.941
And what would you have me do?

02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:41.901
Listen for once.

02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:44.654
Think about
what god promised you.

02:41:44.863 --> 02:41:46.573
Then listen to your sons

02:41:46.781 --> 02:41:49.951
and see if what they have
to say doesn't make sense.

02:41:50.160 --> 02:41:51.828
Unless you want
to see us all die,

02:41:52.036 --> 02:41:54.497
because you're too
frightened to trust god.

02:41:54.706 --> 02:41:57.167
What has this to do
with trusting god?

02:41:58.293 --> 02:41:59.544
Isn't it obvious?

02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:02.839
He's left you only one way out.

02:42:03.214 --> 02:42:05.550
One road to our survival.

02:42:05.758 --> 02:42:08.303
And it leads through Egypt.

02:42:08.511 --> 02:42:12.182
Egypt is our only
salvation, Jacob.

02:42:19.230 --> 02:42:20.732
[Sighs]

02:42:22.192 --> 02:42:24.777
Oh! Jacob. Come.

02:42:28.448 --> 02:42:30.408
[Wind howling]

02:42:43.922 --> 02:42:47.008
These are the finest gifts
we can offer.

02:42:47.217 --> 02:42:49.636
Present them to the Egyptian

02:42:49.844 --> 02:42:52.513
along with this.

02:42:52.722 --> 02:42:55.642
Silver enough for double payment

02:42:55.850 --> 02:42:57.268
for the grain you will buy

02:42:57.477 --> 02:43:00.480
and the grain you brought back.

02:43:19.374 --> 02:43:21.417
Have an easy mind, father.

02:43:21.668 --> 02:43:23.544
All will be well.

02:43:23.753 --> 02:43:26.422
I know it.

02:43:26.631 --> 02:43:28.841
May god go with you
at your right hand

02:43:29.050 --> 02:43:31.886
and bring you back safely to me.

02:43:43.564 --> 02:43:45.525
[Donkey braying]

02:43:52.365 --> 02:43:54.200
[Clamoring]

02:44:01.791 --> 02:44:03.584
[Speaking Egyptian]

02:44:17.056 --> 02:44:20.226
Why have we been brought here
to the great one's house?

02:44:20.435 --> 02:44:22.937
Because of the silver we found
in our sacks. I'm sure of it.

02:44:23.146 --> 02:44:24.522
But we don't know
how it got there.

02:44:24.731 --> 02:44:26.190
All we need do is be truthful.

02:44:26.399 --> 02:44:27.442
Silver?

02:44:28.860 --> 02:44:30.069
What silver?

02:44:30.278 --> 02:44:32.488
I know I received payment
for your grain.

02:44:32.697 --> 02:44:35.616
But we had money
in our grain nonetheless.

02:44:35.825 --> 02:44:38.411
Here, we offer double repayment.

02:44:38.619 --> 02:44:40.496
You owe us nothing.

02:44:40.705 --> 02:44:44.000
Whatever you found must be
a gift from that god of yours.

02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.545
Master, our other brother,

02:44:47.754 --> 02:44:48.796
simeon.

02:44:49.005 --> 02:44:50.131
He's in health?

02:44:51.215 --> 02:44:52.467
Alive, you mean?

02:45:04.562 --> 02:45:05.562
(All) Simeon!

02:45:06.439 --> 02:45:08.900
(Simeon) Welcome to Egypt!

02:45:09.108 --> 02:45:10.276
[Brothers laughing]

02:45:12.737 --> 02:45:14.030
Are you all right? Yeah.

02:45:14.238 --> 02:45:16.074
Where did you get that tunic?
Is that linen?

02:45:16.282 --> 02:45:19.202
The answer to
every question is yes.

02:45:19.410 --> 02:45:20.570
I don't really understand it.

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:23.790
But from the time
you went away, I sat back,

02:45:23.998 --> 02:45:26.292
eating and drinking
like the pharaoh himself.

02:45:26.501 --> 02:45:27.543
[Laughing]

02:45:27.752 --> 02:45:28.836
Come.

02:45:29.045 --> 02:45:32.256
You must be washed
before you dine with the master.

02:45:52.151 --> 02:45:53.403
[Men murmuring]

02:46:12.088 --> 02:46:14.257
(Ednan) You will sit here,

02:46:14.465 --> 02:46:17.301
aside from the master.

02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:19.387
This is a great honor.

02:46:19.595 --> 02:46:22.390
Egyptians never eat
with strangers.

02:46:22.598 --> 02:46:25.726
To them it is considered
an abomination.

02:46:25.935 --> 02:46:30.231
Now, you will sit
in the order I tell you.

02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:32.191
Please.

02:46:36.487 --> 02:46:39.740
Benjamin, you will sit here.

02:46:39.949 --> 02:46:41.534
(Asenath) So, that's Benjamin.

02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:46.205
A handsome young man
if ever I saw one.

02:46:46.414 --> 02:46:48.875
And I hope a pure spirit.
Ednan: Gad.

02:46:52.253 --> 02:46:54.172
Enough delay.

02:46:56.174 --> 02:46:57.174
(Ednan) Issachan

02:46:59.385 --> 02:47:00.385
zebulon.

02:47:05.349 --> 02:47:07.018
Zaphenath-paneah,

02:47:07.226 --> 02:47:10.646
he who guides us
on the road of life.

02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:20.114
Lift up your heads.

02:47:29.832 --> 02:47:32.668
Your master asks,
is your father in good health?

02:47:41.886 --> 02:47:43.137
Yes, master,

02:47:43.387 --> 02:47:46.182
and he sends you
these gifts as homage.

02:47:53.731 --> 02:47:56.025
So this is the brother
of whom you spoke?

02:48:03.991 --> 02:48:05.201
What is your name?

02:48:06.327 --> 02:48:08.788
I am Benjamin, master.

02:48:08.996 --> 02:48:11.832
How is it, master, that
you come to speak our tongue?

02:48:12.959 --> 02:48:15.336
Have you been to our land?

02:48:20.007 --> 02:48:21.926
God be gracious to you, my son.

02:48:31.561 --> 02:48:32.913
Was I wrong to ask
the master how he came

02:48:32.937 --> 02:48:33.980
to speak our tongue?

02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:38.776
The master has traveled widely.

02:48:40.069 --> 02:48:41.404
He understands a great deal.

02:48:44.865 --> 02:48:48.244
Look, we're sitting according
to the order of our birth.

02:48:48.452 --> 02:48:52.373
Reuben and simeon,

02:48:52.582 --> 02:48:53.916

02:48:54.125 --> 02:48:55.209
Judah,

02:48:55.418 --> 02:48:57.253
Dan, naphtali,

02:48:57.461 --> 02:48:58.461
gad and Asher,

02:48:58.546 --> 02:49:00.339
issachar, zebulon,

02:49:00.548 --> 02:49:01.924
finally me.

02:49:03.217 --> 02:49:05.636
I divined the order
of your birth by looking

02:49:05.845 --> 02:49:06.971
into my magic cup.

02:49:08.055 --> 02:49:10.474
[Music playing]

02:49:10.683 --> 02:49:13.102
Oh, ho, ho.

02:49:13.311 --> 02:49:14.770
[Chattering]

02:49:19.692 --> 02:49:21.569
Ah! Ah!

02:49:26.198 --> 02:49:27.408
It is a great honor.

02:49:28.492 --> 02:49:30.745
The master has given you
the food from his own plate.

02:49:32.872 --> 02:49:34.957
Thank you, master.

02:49:35.207 --> 02:49:37.126
We eat the same dish at home.

02:49:37.335 --> 02:49:40.463
In fact, this is
the favorite food of my father.

02:49:40.671 --> 02:49:42.048
[Laughing]

02:49:58.522 --> 02:50:00.358
I could have done
with a little more sleep.

02:50:00.566 --> 02:50:02.068
I don't understand.

02:50:02.276 --> 02:50:04.070
He was so friendly last night.

02:50:04.278 --> 02:50:06.364
Yet this morning he has us
roused from our beds

02:50:06.572 --> 02:50:09.408
before the cock crows
and sends us on our way.

02:50:09.617 --> 02:50:12.995
Look, our asses are already
loaded down with grain.

02:50:17.958 --> 02:50:19.168
[Donkey brays]

02:50:35.017 --> 02:50:37.687
Why did you return
good with evil?

02:50:37.895 --> 02:50:39.772
What can you possibly mean?

02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:41.941
You deny stealing
from my master?

02:50:42.149 --> 02:50:44.402
What kind of fools
would you take us for?

02:50:51.158 --> 02:50:52.576
This.

02:51:17.351 --> 02:51:21.480
If you find anything,
you can kill the culprit

02:51:21.689 --> 02:51:25.359
and make slaves
of the rest of us.

02:51:34.201 --> 02:51:35.745
[Men murmur]

02:51:39.039 --> 02:51:41.667
What have you done,
you little fool?

02:51:41.876 --> 02:51:43.586
Have you taken leave
of your senses?

02:51:47.882 --> 02:51:49.717
Why did you do
such a wicked thing?

02:51:50.092 --> 02:51:51.969
Master, we have done nothing.

02:51:52.178 --> 02:51:53.888
Then how do you explain it?

02:51:57.767 --> 02:52:01.145
God is punishing us for a crime
we committed many years ago.

02:52:01.353 --> 02:52:05.941
It seems he wants us all to
taste the bitterness of slavery

02:52:06.150 --> 02:52:09.361
for surely we are all
your slaves now.

02:52:17.953 --> 02:52:21.123
I am not a vindictive man.

02:52:21.332 --> 02:52:24.043
You can return to your father.
I shall keep only Benjamin.

02:52:25.211 --> 02:52:26.211
No!

02:52:26.253 --> 02:52:27.533
You dare raise your voice to me?

02:52:27.671 --> 02:52:29.590
Men can die for less!

02:52:32.718 --> 02:52:34.678
A thousand pardons, master.

02:52:34.887 --> 02:52:36.806
But the very idea
is unthinkable.

02:52:37.014 --> 02:52:41.101
Master, I cannot pretend
to grasp the meaning

02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:43.479
of these strange happenings.

02:52:43.687 --> 02:52:45.481
Benjamin has never
stolen in his life.

02:52:45.731 --> 02:52:47.024
-Neven -(Man)Never, master.

02:52:47.233 --> 02:52:49.819
And he's too clever to take
a cherished and unique object

02:52:50.027 --> 02:52:51.612
from a man as powerful as you.

02:52:52.738 --> 02:52:54.341
Nor do I know how
the money got into our sacks

02:52:54.365 --> 02:52:55.366
on our previous trip.

02:52:56.242 --> 02:52:57.618
Perhaps it was
all the work of god.

02:52:59.912 --> 02:53:02.081
Master, please.
Spare the life of Benjamin,

02:53:02.289 --> 02:53:04.834
beloved son
of our father's old age.

02:53:05.042 --> 02:53:08.003
Losing Benjamin
would kill our old father,

02:53:08.212 --> 02:53:10.673
whom we have already
wounded deeply.

02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:15.219
Take me as a slave
in place of Benjamin.

02:53:15.427 --> 02:53:17.680
Allow the boy to go home
to his father.

02:53:17.888 --> 02:53:20.349
No. Benjamin will stay with me.

02:53:31.193 --> 02:53:32.193
No!

02:53:32.236 --> 02:53:33.612
[Shouting indistinctly]

02:53:36.991 --> 02:53:38.534
I'm sorry, master!

02:53:38.742 --> 02:53:40.703
But we must take the boy
back to our father!

02:53:40.911 --> 02:53:42.496
Or die in the attempt?

02:53:42.705 --> 02:53:43.765
We would rather die
a thousand times

02:53:43.789 --> 02:53:45.958
than see such pain
in our father's eyes again!

02:53:46.166 --> 02:53:49.753
Or live another 20 years
of wretched cowardice!

02:54:01.098 --> 02:54:02.141
No, master!

02:54:09.023 --> 02:54:10.743
So you are now ready
to sacrifice your lives

02:54:10.900 --> 02:54:12.318
for one of your brothers?

02:54:15.779 --> 02:54:18.115
Why then did you not do
the same for the other one?

02:54:18.324 --> 02:54:19.783
The one you said died,
when in truth,

02:54:19.992 --> 02:54:22.286
you yourselves
sold him into slavery.

02:54:23.954 --> 02:54:25.247
You know about Joseph?

02:54:26.081 --> 02:54:27.081
How?

02:54:29.335 --> 02:54:30.794
Because he is alive.

02:54:31.003 --> 02:54:32.003
(Man) What?

02:54:33.464 --> 02:54:36.425
He's here in this palace.
(Man) Joseph? Alive?

02:54:40.596 --> 02:54:43.390
In fact, he's in this room.

02:54:47.811 --> 02:54:48.854
Leave us.

02:54:50.314 --> 02:54:52.358
I said, leave us! Get out!

02:54:55.486 --> 02:54:56.486
Guards!

02:54:56.570 --> 02:54:57.613
Come!

02:55:34.608 --> 02:55:36.276
I am Joseph.

02:55:41.073 --> 02:55:46.161
[Whispering] Joseph?

02:55:46.370 --> 02:55:48.288
[Spears clattering]

02:55:50.332 --> 02:55:51.709
Joseph?

02:55:53.502 --> 02:55:54.628
It is...

02:55:56.130 --> 02:55:57.798
My brother Joseph!

02:56:04.763 --> 02:56:06.306
Yes.

02:56:06.515 --> 02:56:08.225
It is I.

02:56:08.726 --> 02:56:11.186
But be at peace.

02:56:21.113 --> 02:56:22.113
Come closer.

02:56:23.532 --> 02:56:25.409
Don't be afraid.
I will not harm you.

02:56:25.617 --> 02:56:28.037
Am I to take the place of god?

02:56:28.245 --> 02:56:29.538
Joseph.

02:56:30.789 --> 02:56:32.583
It is not for me to punish you.

02:56:37.004 --> 02:56:39.048
You meant evil against me, yes.

02:56:44.428 --> 02:56:46.972
But god meant it for good.

02:56:47.181 --> 02:56:49.391
To bring it about that
many people should be kept alive

02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:51.310
as they are today.

02:56:57.066 --> 02:56:58.275
So fear not.

02:57:00.402 --> 02:57:03.655
I shall provide for you
and for your families

02:57:03.864 --> 02:57:06.200
and especially for our father.

02:57:15.209 --> 02:57:18.962
I am most to blame.

02:57:27.513 --> 02:57:32.184
I deserve to be
enslaved or killed.

02:57:34.353 --> 02:57:35.479
No.

02:57:36.522 --> 02:57:37.773
My brother...

02:57:38.482 --> 02:57:40.317
I shall not kill you.

02:57:43.320 --> 02:57:44.988
That is not the lesson the lord,

02:57:45.197 --> 02:57:47.783
blessed be his name,
has put before us.

02:57:47.991 --> 02:57:49.409
(Jacob's sons)
Blessed be his name.

02:57:51.537 --> 02:57:54.748
Perhaps we have learned
the meaning of brotherhood,

02:57:54.957 --> 02:57:56.959
of family.

02:57:57.167 --> 02:57:59.795
And that wherever we may go,
no matter how god's plan

02:58:00.003 --> 02:58:00.712
separates us,

02:58:00.921 --> 02:58:04.716
we must always be true
to one another,

02:58:04.925 --> 02:58:06.135
to be family.

02:58:17.688 --> 02:58:19.773
You must return for our father.

02:58:19.982 --> 02:58:22.317
Tell him of what I have
achieved and move him here

02:58:22.526 --> 02:58:23.819
with all your belongings.

02:58:24.361 --> 02:58:25.112
I want you near me

02:58:25.320 --> 02:58:27.120
in the land of goshen
so I may provide for you

02:58:27.239 --> 02:58:28.839
during the remaining years
of the famine.

02:58:29.408 --> 02:58:31.285
I have spoken to the pharaoh.
All is prepared.

02:58:35.330 --> 02:58:36.330
Come to me.

02:58:37.541 --> 02:58:38.709
Come to me.

02:58:40.669 --> 02:58:41.837
I'm your brother.

02:58:43.422 --> 02:58:44.590
I am Joseph.

02:58:51.263 --> 02:58:53.265
Blessed be his name.

02:58:53.473 --> 02:58:55.893
(All) Blessed be his name.

02:59:16.163 --> 02:59:17.456
[Whinnying]

03:00:41.873 --> 03:00:44.084
Hyathyah!

03:00:55.679 --> 03:00:56.888
Hyathyah!

03:00:57.097 --> 03:00:58.390
Hyah!

03:01:25.459 --> 03:01:26.460
Father.

03:01:26.918 --> 03:01:28.670
Father.

03:01:28.879 --> 03:01:31.298
[Whispers]
Truly, this is my Joseph.

03:01:31.965 --> 03:01:34.843
My son, my son.

03:01:38.096 --> 03:01:39.931
[Weeping]

03:01:47.397 --> 03:01:51.109
I did not think
to ever see your face again.

03:02:08.835 --> 03:02:09.836
And these...

03:02:10.462 --> 03:02:13.590
I see to be my grandchildren.

03:02:13.799 --> 03:02:16.676
Rachel's light
shines in their eyes.

03:02:16.885 --> 03:02:19.596
Come, come, my children.

03:02:19.805 --> 03:02:21.431
Come that I might bless you.

03:02:23.642 --> 03:02:24.684
Come.

03:02:27.229 --> 03:02:28.522
Oh.

03:02:42.911 --> 03:02:46.581
I am indeed blessed that I have
again held you in my arms

03:02:46.790 --> 03:02:48.834
and laid eyes upon your sons.

03:02:49.876 --> 03:02:52.546
Now truly, I can die in peace.

03:02:54.131 --> 03:02:57.259
There will be no talk
of death, my father.

03:02:57.467 --> 03:02:58.718
Then god will it.

03:03:02.305 --> 03:03:03.305
(Jacob) And then you will

03:03:03.432 --> 03:03:05.183
take me back to canaan,

03:03:05.392 --> 03:03:08.770
the land god promised Abraham.

03:03:08.979 --> 03:03:12.107
And it will be
as the lord promised.

03:03:12.315 --> 03:03:16.111
Our descendants
shall be known as Israel

03:03:16.319 --> 03:03:19.072
and will be
a multitude of nations,

03:03:19.281 --> 03:03:22.075
each brother unto himself,

03:03:22.284 --> 03:03:24.995
a tribe of Israel.
