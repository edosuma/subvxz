WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:04.170
Our friend was kidnapped.

00:05.338 --> 00:06.464
Is there a ransom demand?

00:06.464 --> 00:08.174
<i>This woman named Billie
demanded this relic.</i>

00:08.174 --> 00:09.968
It's supposed to lead to a treasure.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.678
<i>That's what Peter Sadusky told me.</i>

00:11.678 --> 00:13.513
He actually died not long after.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.599
And it was maybe
under mysterious circumstances.

00:16.599 --> 00:19.310
You ordered a toxicology report
concerning Peter Sadusky's death.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.688
You want me to cancel
the toxicology report?

00:21.688 --> 00:22.939
Let's give the man some dignity.

00:22.939 --> 00:25.066
<i>This is a real deal</i>

00:25.066 --> 00:26.776
Holyfield treasure hunt.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.236
You can't take risks like this.

00:28.236 --> 00:29.362
You could get deported.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.489
<i>Your father's medallion was worn</i>

00:31.489 --> 00:34.743
<i>by a secret network
of treasure protectors.</i>

00:35.535 --> 00:36.995
These look like sections of a map.

00:36.995 --> 00:38.747
I think I have something
you're gonna wanna see.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.457
<i>My dad died hunting this treasure.</i>

00:40.457 --> 00:41.499
This is what started it all.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.168
The author of this paper is...

00:43.918 --> 00:44.919
my mom.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.433
Oh, god.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.520
Our friendship really needs
a snooze button.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.481
Where's your old mini DV camcorder?

01:04.481 --> 01:06.483
I don't know, in a box somewhere.

01:09.527 --> 01:10.862
Uh, who are you?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.489
Uh, Liam.

01:13.531 --> 01:15.116
Tasha's rebound.

01:15.116 --> 01:16.367
He's with me.

01:17.035 --> 01:17.869
Oh.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.662
Poor Ethan.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.748
- Who's Ethan?
- A friend.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.334
Uh, what do you need my camera for?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.669
I think my mom's on this.

01:26.669 --> 01:28.463
I think she knew about the treasure.

01:29.923 --> 01:30.840
THESIS DEFENSE DOCTORATE 1999

01:42.477 --> 01:44.604
Whoa, check out your mom.

01:45.188 --> 01:46.106
She's so young.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.108
Good morning.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.776
Uh, are there subtitles?

01:49.776 --> 01:50.777
I got it.

01:52.153 --> 01:56.282
Thousands of years ago,
before the Europeans arrived,

01:56.282 --> 01:59.911
a bunch of independent tribes
spanned the Americas.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.916
Some of them pass their history
and culture down through textiles and art.

02:06.417 --> 02:07.836
<i>Whenever war broke out,</i>

02:07.836 --> 02:10.088
<i>some of the women fled
with their sacred objects</i>

02:10.088 --> 02:12.382
<i>so their history would be preserved.</i>

02:12.382 --> 02:16.094
Over time, a treasure grew
until the greatest threat arrived.

02:17.178 --> 02:18.513
<i>The conquistadors.</i>

02:18.513 --> 02:20.765
I know who I'm rooting for.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.352
Not the conquistadors, okay?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.354
I'm pro-Goddess. Do not cancel me.

02:26.354 --> 02:29.107
But there was one brave woman
who risked her life to save the treasure

02:29.107 --> 02:30.400
from the conquistadors.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.278
Malinche.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.906
<i>An enslaved Nahua teenager
who was forced to work</i>

02:36.906 --> 02:39.242
<i>for Hernán Cortés as a translator.</i>

02:39.826 --> 02:41.411
Over the last 200 years,

02:41.411 --> 02:43.538
her name has been dragged through the mud

02:43.538 --> 02:46.624
for helping the Spanish
slaughter indigenous peoples

02:46.624 --> 02:48.209
in their quest for gold.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.336
<i>But the truth is,</i>

02:50.336 --> 02:53.089
<i>Malinche used her position
in Cortes's camp</i>

02:53.089 --> 02:57.302
<i>to keep one eye on the conquistadors
while her underground alliance of women</i>

02:57.302 --> 02:59.012
<i>could smuggle the treasure away.</i>

02:59.012 --> 03:00.805
So Malinche was a master spy.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.767
Like Brian O'Conner from <i>Fast and Furious.</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:07.353
<i>Jess, they're all
wearing your necklace.</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:16.029
That necklace represents an ancient oath

03:16.029 --> 03:18.573
to unbury the lost history

03:18.573 --> 03:21.117
of entire civilizations.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.996
If your father had that necklace,
then he was protecting the treasure.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.373
<i>And so must you.</i>

03:28.374 --> 03:31.878
These women called themselves
the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.671
<i>Once the treasure was hidden,</i>

03:33.671 --> 03:36.799
<i>the women created a treasure map
and broke it into three pieces,</i>

03:36.799 --> 03:38.676
<i>giving one each to the Aztec,</i>

03:38.676 --> 03:40.178
<i>Inca, and Maya,</i>

03:40.178 --> 03:43.514
with the idea that once the conquistadors
were vanquished,

03:43.514 --> 03:47.310
they would come together again
to rejoin the pieces of the map

03:47.310 --> 03:48.811
and find the treasure.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.940
Please tell me she said where it was.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.485
The three pieces of the map
were lost over time.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.527
Yeah.

03:59.197 --> 04:02.033
And what's Professor Mansplainer saying?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.035
They're saying her dissertation
is fantasy.

04:04.035 --> 04:08.289
That every scholar agrees
the Inca and Mesoamerican civilizations

04:08.289 --> 04:09.332
never communicated,

04:09.332 --> 04:11.417
let alone work together
to hide a great treasure.

04:11.417 --> 04:15.338
And that Malinche wasn't a hero,
that she was a traitor,

04:15.338 --> 04:17.757
at best, a powerless victim.

04:18.591 --> 04:21.344
<i>Professor with all due respect, but...</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:22.720
I like this guy's energy.

04:22.720 --> 04:24.722
- Who's he?
- That's...

04:27.725 --> 04:29.143
That's my dad.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.020
I thought your parents
didn't like each other.

04:31.354 --> 04:32.313
Me too.

04:32.855 --> 04:34.649
Sounds like he's got a lot of skin
in the game.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.442
He's defending her.

04:38.611 --> 04:42.615
My dad is saying he and my mom
are gonna prove the legend is real

04:42.615 --> 04:44.867
by... by finding the treasure.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.006
<i>Ah. My lady.</i>

05:02.302 --> 05:03.594
Oh.

05:06.973 --> 05:07.932
I love you.

06:30.681 --> 06:34.268
I've never even heard
his voice before.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.108
And to see them dancing.

06:43.820 --> 06:47.657
I guess it was pretty dumb to think
there wasn't a time when they were...

06:52.286 --> 06:53.496
In love?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.040
Those dudes wouldn't even listen
to your mom.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.917
She was dropping treasure knowledge.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.503
Well, my dad listened to her.

07:01.003 --> 07:03.131
I always thought he was chasing a dream.

07:05.341 --> 07:08.678
But... you have the necklace.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.305
That means our families
weren't crazy.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.932
The treasure is real.

07:13.599 --> 07:14.642
Treasure?

07:18.020 --> 07:20.064
I thought you were done with all that.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.361
This is Agent Ross.

07:25.361 --> 07:27.363
Hi, this is Dr. Zeke Hudson
from the city morgue.

07:27.363 --> 07:30.283
<i>Did you order this panel
on Peter Sadusky?</i>

07:30.283 --> 07:32.326
I did, yes. Uh, do you have the results?

07:32.326 --> 07:36.581
Yeah. Uh, I just need an e-signature
on the release before I can send it out.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.834
No, you know, I'd rather come down
in person and sign, and then

07:39.834 --> 07:41.377
<i>we can go through those results together.</i>

07:41.377 --> 07:42.628
Uh, sure. Yeah.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.046
<i>Is 10:00 a.m. okay?</i>

07:44.046 --> 07:46.090
- Yeah. I'll be there.
- Ross.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.842
Hey, thanks for going through
all those statements.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.343
I know that's tedious work.

07:49.343 --> 07:50.928
- It's no problem, sir.
- Yeah.

07:53.181 --> 07:56.642
Listen. Uh, I know how you're feeling.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.438
When I was first stationed in D.C.
back in the Mesozoic era,

08:00.438 --> 08:05.026
I failed to act on a tip
that the Declaration of Independence

08:05.026 --> 08:06.277
was about to be stolen.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.237
That was you?

08:08.237 --> 08:09.530
Yeah. That was me.

08:10.114 --> 08:13.284
And like you,
I was eager to make up for it.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.452
It affected my judgment.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.787
Luckily, I had a good boss
who believed in me.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.626
I believe in you, Ross.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.211
Mm.

08:29.383 --> 08:30.510
<i>I love you.</i>

08:31.719 --> 08:33.012
I don't understand.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.598
There's more. Look at this.

08:44.106 --> 08:47.902
<i>♪ Sleep, precious child ♪</i>

08:47.902 --> 08:49.195
Wait.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.947
That's your mom's lullaby?

08:52.323 --> 08:54.242
There is a second verse she never sang.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.204
"You can sleep, precious child.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.830
Our treasure is safe.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.791
Till we rise again tomorrow."

09:04.335 --> 09:06.754
The lullaby passed down
the legend of the treasure.

09:08.756 --> 09:09.674
Whoa.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.346
Did I tell you Billie was a black market
antiquities dealer?

09:17.098 --> 09:20.351
Which means if she finds a treasure,
it'll wind up in the hands

09:20.351 --> 09:22.144
of some sketchy, rich collector.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.439
And no one will know my mom was right.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.402
Where do we start?

09:33.322 --> 09:35.074
Whoa.

09:35.074 --> 09:39.412
This is cooler than any room
on any episode of <i>Cribs</i> I've ever seen.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.955
Including Mariah's house.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.748
You really undersold clue room.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.127
Yo, look.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.214
Look, it's the panel
from the Resolute Desk.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.259
Ben Franklin glasses.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.636
Oh, my god.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.141
Your grandpa is the redacted FBI agent
in Riley Poole's podcast.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.976
Yeah, I'm not really a podcast guy.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.398
It says "do not touch."

10:09.984 --> 10:11.360
Cool, cool, cool.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.278
Love this clue room.

10:12.278 --> 10:16.949
Don't get me wrong, uh, but I'm not seeing
a map with an "X Marks the Spot" anywhere.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.035
The treasure map's on the three boxes.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.621
We find them, we find the treasure.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.873
Obsidian.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.082
Jade.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.543
Blue Lapis.

10:27.543 --> 10:32.548
Well, Billie took the obsidian box,
but Tasha Fierce got pics.

10:33.633 --> 10:37.053
My, uh... My grandpa found this one.
That's Cibola.

10:37.678 --> 10:38.721
Great. Where is it?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.598
He gave it to my dad.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.893
Two days later,
he died in a diving accident.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.519
It's never been seen again.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.854
That's sad.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.816
So... we're at a dead end.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.069
Pretty much.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.239
I mean, we got this one clue
in the third box,

10:57.239 --> 10:59.367
my grandpa and dad
were never able to crack.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.454
"A message was passed to the Sun King
born to Peace."

11:03.454 --> 11:04.580
Where'd they get this?

11:04.580 --> 11:07.583
Dad was a Mason, grandpa was a Mason.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.085
I'm guessing they got it from the Masons.

11:10.961 --> 11:11.921
Okay.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.215
The Sun King.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.758
You know who's called the Sun King?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.093
- Louis XIV.
- Louis XIV.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.097
His parents were married
as a political allegiance.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.724
Strengthening ties between France
and the Iberian Union.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.017
Louisiana was named after him.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.977
You think the message he was passed
might be in Louisiana?

11:26.977 --> 11:29.355
Or in what was the Louisiana territory.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.568
But why would any indigenous person
give a clue to a French king?

11:35.152 --> 11:39.365
Uh, Jess, who is Salazar?

11:40.074 --> 11:42.410
And should we beware of him?

11:42.410 --> 11:44.120
No idea.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.996
It was just a loose paper in there.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.917
Come on. There's gotta be
another Sun King.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.752
Maybe it's not a real king.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.212
What? Like the Lion King?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.423
LeBron! King James.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.882
I was thinking the King of Rock and Roll.

11:57.883 --> 11:58.801
Elvis?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.803
Yes. His label was Sun Records.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.638
Whoa, whoa!

12:02.638 --> 12:04.098
That makes sense.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.559
Elvis was totally a mason. Here.

12:08.769 --> 12:13.649
When he met President Nixon,
he was doing a secret Mason handshake.

12:14.233 --> 12:18.779
And as you know, Elvis is mixed up
in all sorts of conspiracies.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.157
- You mean was.
- Do I?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.492
You want a more fun fact than that one?

12:23.492 --> 12:25.161
Uh, Elvis was Cherokee.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.580
His three times great grandmother
was Cherokee.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.541
Her name was Morning Dove White.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.751
Dove.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.128
The symbol of peace.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.256
That's why peace is capitalized.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.799
It's a person.

12:47.892 --> 12:50.686
"North American tribes
like the Puebloans in the Southwest

12:50.686 --> 12:53.439
and the Cherokee in the Southeast
were rumored to have helped

12:53.439 --> 12:55.191
the Daughters of the Plumed Serpent."

12:55.191 --> 12:57.276
So Morning Dove had a clue
and passed it down.

12:57.276 --> 13:01.530
Not knowing that her great, great,
great grandson would become Elvis.

13:02.573 --> 13:05.993
His favorite guitar
was called The Ebony Dove.

13:07.077 --> 13:11.582
So what you're saying is Elvis put a clue
to an ancient treasure on a guitar?

13:12.458 --> 13:15.377
If you're gonna hide a clue
to an ancient treasure on something,

13:15.377 --> 13:16.837
it makes sense to pick something...

13:16.837 --> 13:18.923
That would become a museum piece...

13:19.840 --> 13:20.716
- at Graceland.
- At Graceland.

13:24.553 --> 13:29.099
Yeah. The only problem is
I don't see any mention of that guitar

13:29.099 --> 13:30.726
on Graceland inventory.

13:32.186 --> 13:34.396
Well, it's gotta be in Elvis's
secret room.

13:36.732 --> 13:39.360
The secret room at Graceland.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.362
Y'all don't know about this.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.657
Am I the only one who cares about history?

13:44.657 --> 13:49.495
All the most valuable and secret
Elvis stuff is stored in a hidden room.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.788
No one's allowed in.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.123
No one's even allowed to know where it is.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.210
They let Oprah in once
and she had to be blindfolded.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.795
Oprah.

13:57.795 --> 14:01.465
So all we have to do
is find a guitar that may not exist.

14:01.465 --> 14:04.301
By breaking into a room
that may not exist.

14:05.511 --> 14:06.470
Yeah.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.185
And I think I know how to do it.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.647
Apparently,
Jess Valenzuela has quite the bio.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.483
It's a real rags-to-rags story here.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.694
She was born in Mexico,
grew up in Baton Rouge,

14:21.694 --> 14:24.238
a scholarship student at Oak Prep,

14:24.238 --> 14:26.824
and she was the first DACA recipient
to graduate valedictorian.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.743
And she had her pick
of any college, Harvard, Yale.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.036
And then her mom gets sick,

14:31.036 --> 14:36.208
so she gives up university
to take care of her until she dies.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.004
And all of that she's left with
is a stack of medical bills

14:40.004 --> 14:41.463
to remember her by.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.508
Yet, she refused my offer.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.096
And I would have paid her bills.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.723
Why?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.225
Kids these days,
they don't care about money.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.436
They just want more and more followers.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.731
Find a treasure, baby, you famous.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.649
This thing is ingenious.

15:02.234 --> 15:05.279
Magnetized lodestone acted like a compass.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.323
That's what unlocked the dials.

15:07.323 --> 15:10.075
Safe cracking 101.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.896
That girl opened this.

15:38.896 --> 15:41.941
I'm still not sure why Sadusky told her,

15:41.941 --> 15:46.946
but he inadvertently gave us
a very big clue.

15:51.408 --> 15:54.495
We were looking for clues
to the treasure map on the outside,

15:54.495 --> 15:57.081
and we should have been looking
in the inside.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.585
Thank you.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.888
Let's take a look on the inside
of this one, shall we?

16:14.348 --> 16:16.767
- You're new at the field office.
- Yup.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.560
And you're running point on this?

16:19.436 --> 16:20.938
- Yes, I am.
- Huh.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.732
Your boss must have a lot of faith in you.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.985
You're investigating the death
of a decorated agent.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.950
Okay, here's the situation. Um...

16:33.867 --> 16:37.204
I was actually supposed to cancel
that tox report,

16:37.204 --> 16:40.624
but I got a tip that Peter Sadusky died
under mysterious circumstances,

16:40.624 --> 16:44.169
so I disregarded the order.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.090
You can report me now if you want.

16:50.384 --> 16:53.554
Or you could tell me what you found.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.393
All right. Don't get too ahead
of yourself.

17:00.310 --> 17:03.063
Unfortunately,
the panel is inconclusive,

17:03.063 --> 17:04.523
but it's very suspicious.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.942
That's a lot of unknown substances.

17:06.942 --> 17:07.901
Yeah.

17:07.901 --> 17:10.487
But given his age,
he's probably taken quite a few meds.

17:10.487 --> 17:11.530
Mm.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.950
And there was an orange stain on his hand.

17:16.201 --> 17:20.706
So he was clutching something
in his hand when he died?

17:20.706 --> 17:23.042
Could be. Looks like a common dye.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.461
Something used in over-the-counter meds,
even candy.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.881
If I got you a list of his meds,
could you whittle down this list?

17:29.465 --> 17:32.217
Not that either of us
are working on this case.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.427
Yeah, I mean,

17:33.427 --> 17:36.221
the last thing I'd want is to be part
of a juicy murder investigation.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.139
Mm.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.101
Thank you.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.230
Two boxes, 12 pieces.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.399
And we have two-thirds of the map.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.942
And look at this.

17:48.942 --> 17:51.695
Iztaccihuatl.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.655
The White Woman Mountains.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.742
- You can see here.
- That's a jaguar head.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.119
The Aztecs used
to call that "earth monster."

17:59.119 --> 18:01.955
Signifies the entrance to a sacred place.

18:01.955 --> 18:03.916
That totally tracks
the White Woman Mountains

18:03.916 --> 18:05.584
and they're right outside of Mexico City.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.211
Is that where the third box is?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.547
Mm, we don't know until we get there.

18:11.298 --> 18:15.052
<i>♪ Oh, you make me wanna break the rules ♪</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.637
Well, call me Deadliest Catch

18:16.637 --> 18:19.348
because Mark took the bait
in my fishing expedition.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.141
- Mark?
- The head of security.

18:21.141 --> 18:23.519
You phished
the head of Graceland's security.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.688
It's not my fault he can't resist
a promo code for Labradoodle breath bones.

18:26.688 --> 18:29.983
What? His doodles have
their own Instagram page.

18:29.983 --> 18:30.984
Let's go over the plan.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.070
Uh, no. Are you kidding?

18:33.070 --> 18:35.072
Have you ever seen a movie
where they do a heist?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.574
You cannot go over the plan.
Something just guaranteed to go wrong.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.118
That's not how reality works.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.079
At 1:00 p.m.,
they open the display cases for cleaning.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.580
- Then it's you, Oren.
- No.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.708
I will not be a part of this clear effort
to jinx our mission.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.210
Dude, all you gotta do
is release the moths.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.004
And the second they see the moths
on the priceless jumpsuits,

18:51.004 --> 18:52.506
they'll call the exterminators.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.633
So we're all just on board with moths

18:54.633 --> 18:56.218
turning Elvis's jumpsuits
into Swiss cheese?

18:56.218 --> 18:58.262
They're not that kind of moth.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.638
There's more than one type of moth?

18:59.638 --> 19:01.306
I worked at Almighty Storage.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.808
Pretty much a moth expert.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.518
We got the non-clothes-eating type.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.813
So we got 13 minutes
to get in and out of the secret room

19:07.813 --> 19:09.439
before the real exterminators show up.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.151
Thirteen minutes, that's very specific.
What's your source on that?

19:12.734 --> 19:13.902
- Yelp.
- Hey, dudes...

19:13.902 --> 19:15.612
I still think I should be the one
to go in.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.447
We've been over this.
Let's stick to the plan.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.907
Liam is a guitar expert.

19:18.907 --> 19:21.326
Anything out of place on that axe,
I'll know it.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.619
Hey, uh, people...

19:22.619 --> 19:24.580
Oren, we're not going to jinx it.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.581
Oh, really?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.207
'Cause now there's someone following us.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.625
Brown Chrysler on the left.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.296
- It's Billie?
- Or her minions.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.258
- Dude, outrun them!
- Do I look like I got NOS in here?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.718
My baby don't race.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.890
Pull over and see what they do.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.317
Anyone recognize him?

19:54.067 --> 19:55.110
Not me.

19:55.110 --> 19:56.820
Maybe it was the Salazar guy.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.823
He was probably just some bearded rando
on his way to a vinyl sale.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.285
Yeah.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.621
Let's get back on the road.

20:07.581 --> 20:08.457

20:51.041 --> 20:51.875
What?

20:51.875 --> 20:54.294
I was up till 2:00 in the morning
doing research about moths

20:54.294 --> 20:55.337
to prepare for my role.

20:56.004 --> 20:58.298
What's to prepare?
We show up and pretend to kill bugs.

21:00.467 --> 21:01.593

Yeah. Oh, yeah. Um...

21:12.020 --> 21:13.146
And all that gold.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.654
We are in the building.

21:27.494 --> 21:29.705
<i>Uh, Oren, it's almost</i>

21:29.705 --> 21:31.456

22:04.406 --> 22:06.533
Out of the way. Thank you.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.836
Mm.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.340
- Good?
- Yes. Of course.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.177
- Okay, let's go next.
- Okay.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.763
Excuse me.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.222
Hi. Question.

22:29.222 --> 22:31.016
Uh, did Elvis...

22:31.725 --> 22:33.560
Is that a moth?

22:35.354 --> 22:36.772
And that's the call
to the exterminator.

22:36.897 --> 22:37.939
Sync timers.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.025
You ready?

22:40.776 --> 22:44.279
Three, two, one, go.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.656
Clock's ticking, 13 minutes.

22:58.835 --> 23:00.212
Who are you guys?

23:00.212 --> 23:01.296
Where's Tim?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.383
- We, uh--
- You must be Mark, right?

23:05.550 --> 23:06.593
Uh, yeah.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.387
We're subcontracting for Tim.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.180
He's on a big job right now

23:10.180 --> 23:12.015
but he knew this was an emergency.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.726
He mentioned you've got a Labradoodle?

23:15.894 --> 23:16.728
Two.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.564
Hound Dog and Blue Suede.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.528
Got one myself. Name's Jolene.

23:29.199 --> 23:30.283
Follow us.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.212
Oh. Okay.

23:46.007 --> 23:47.884
Meet <i>Tineola bisselliella.</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:49.678
Your common webbing clothes moth.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.597
This little guy likes to feed
on animal fibers, leather, wool.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.600
Oh, my god. We can't close to fumigate.
It's Jailhouse Week.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.185
Oh, no need for that.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.062
Just let us take a look around.

23:59.062 --> 24:01.940
And we should start
in dark storage spaces.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.775
- Moths love that.
- Mm-hm.

24:03.775 --> 24:08.822
Okay. Mark, you take Arin to "the room".

24:08.822 --> 24:10.031
And, Dean, you come with me.

24:10.031 --> 24:12.033
Oh, we actually prefer to work in tandem.

24:12.033 --> 24:13.994
Oh, it's too much ground to cover
all at once.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.079
I'd rather do this quickly. Okay?
Come, come.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.838
Um, splitting up wasn't
a part of the plan.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.592
This way.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.558
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.094
He must have gone underground.

25:16.223 --> 25:19.226
Normally, we blindfold anyone
before we bring them down here.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.561
I'll have you sign an NDA
before you leave today.

25:21.561 --> 25:22.562
You know what that is?

25:22.562 --> 25:24.564
Non-disclosure thing means

25:24.564 --> 25:27.484
anything you saw here today,
you didn't see.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.446
Well, if there are moths in here,

25:31.446 --> 25:34.366
they'll leave a yellow dust-like pollen
on the jumpsuits.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.992
I'm gonna need to inspect them.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.288
Mission accomplished.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.873
It was hella stressful, but I did it.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.083
I am donezo.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.251
Jess...

25:45.919 --> 25:47.671
The real exterminators are here.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.047
He's early.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.924
Oh, man, I knew it.

26:11.319 --> 26:12.237
I called it.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.823
- Y'all jinxed it.
- Oren, go stall him.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.408
- Me?
- Now!

26:24.958 --> 26:26.084
There you go.

26:27.627 --> 26:29.879
They're all clear. Moth free.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.270
We're all good here.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.314
Is... Is there a restroom I could use?

26:50.775 --> 26:54.279
- Hey, Mr. Exterminator.
- Who are you?

26:55.238 --> 26:56.489
I'm the hotel manager.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.867
We got a Defcon-10 moth situation
over here

26:58.867 --> 26:59.993
if you just follow me.

26:59.993 --> 27:02.203
- Yeah, but Mark said we're in the mansion.
- And, Mark...

27:02.203 --> 27:04.247
I'm the one who told Mark to call you.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.022
Let's check the velvet paintings
and the guest room next.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.025
Absolutely.

27:32.025 --> 27:34.903
Uh, I just need to grab another battery
from the truck.

27:34.903 --> 27:35.904
I'll be right back.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.492
I'll be back. One second.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.923
Hey.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.299
Did he get the pics?

27:57.425 --> 28:00.345
- Oh, nice guitar.
- Yeah, but nothing looks like a clue.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.889
Maybe it's the wrong Sun King.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.854
Elvis's gold record of "La Paloma".

28:11.064 --> 28:12.565
That single never went gold.

28:12.565 --> 28:14.275
"La Paloma" means "dove".

28:14.275 --> 28:15.652
That's gotta be it.

28:18.029 --> 28:20.907
I got the exterminator
all the way to the hotel and ran for it.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.078
- Did I miss something?
- We all did.

28:25.078 --> 28:26.705
We gotta go back in.

28:26.705 --> 28:27.706
Get that record.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.624
Uh, did you not just hear what I said?

28:29.624 --> 28:31.126
The exterminator is back.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.961
Uh, everyone
is gonna be looking for us.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.212
We will all be arrested.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.595
Jess, what are you doing?

28:42.595 --> 28:45.056
- I have to know the truth about my dad.
- Uh...

28:45.056 --> 28:46.641
- Hey, I'll go with you.
- Not like this.

28:46.641 --> 28:48.852
- We'll find another way.
- There is no other way.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.020
They're gonna shut this place down.
It's now or never.

28:51.604 --> 28:52.522
Jess.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.773
All right, I got her.

29:19.048 --> 29:20.049
Where's Jess?

29:25.638 --> 29:26.931
I got the pics. What's he doing?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.433
They were just here.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.060
Okay. Somebody talk to me.

29:31.060 --> 29:33.104
Where'd those exterminators go?

29:33.104 --> 29:35.231
<i>I'll check right now, sir. Copy.</i>

29:40.779 --> 29:42.530
No. She can't do that.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.951
You be lookout. I'm going in.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.077
Okay.

30:02.759 --> 30:04.552
There's a code panel to get into the room.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.971
- You need to get out of there.
- <i>Did you see it? The code?</i>

30:06.971 --> 30:08.181
No. He blocked the panel.

30:08.181 --> 30:09.516
- <i>Come on.</i>
- How many beeps?

30:09.516 --> 30:10.642
<i>Uh...</i>

30:11.184 --> 30:14.145
<i>Eight. But you don't have time
to figure it out. Come on.</i>

30:14.145 --> 30:15.939
Eight digits, that could be anything.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.067
- You didn't hire these guys?
- No, I don't subcontract.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.610
We let them into the secret room.

30:20.610 --> 30:23.071
I'm calling the police
to make sure nothing was taken.

30:23.071 --> 30:26.366
I was with him the entire time.
He didn't take anything.

30:26.366 --> 30:28.243
Well, he was in there for something.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.828
Eight digits?

30:29.828 --> 30:31.287
That's a date.

30:31.287 --> 30:32.872
Day, month, four-digit year.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.332
<i>What's Elvis's birthday?</i>

30:35.708 --> 30:37.752
Zero, one, zero, eight, 19, 35.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.713
No.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.175
The day of his comeback show?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.761
One, two, zero, three, 19, 68.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.431
No.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.142
Excuse me.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.436
- Sorry.
- I'm taking our picture one more time...

30:55.436 --> 30:56.563
What?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.399
Hey. Hey, man, can I borrow that?

30:59.399 --> 31:02.318
Not his anniversary.
Not the day he met Nixon.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.820
What is it?

31:32.640 --> 31:34.309
The day he bought Graceland.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.853
March 25th, 1957.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.062

35:12.527 --> 35:15.655
Everybody, please start heading out
that door behind me.

35:21.828 --> 35:23.913
I am so sorry, sir.

35:23.913 --> 35:26.457
The only English he speaks is Elvis songs.

35:26.457 --> 35:28.793
He gets out of control when he sings them.

35:38.010 --> 35:38.928
Get him out of here.

35:38.928 --> 35:40.721
Put him on the "No Fly" list.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.225
They're gonna check the feeds.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.144
Nope, I got this.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.771
- Was anything stolen?
- Not that I can see.

35:48.771 --> 35:50.398
Check the security footage.

35:53.109 --> 35:54.652
They're about to get ghosted.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.530
Oh, no.

35:57.530 --> 35:59.615

36:27.643 --> 36:30.313

36:30.313 --> 36:32.523
You sang an Elvis song at Graceland.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.026
Yeah. Now I'm gonna be banned for life.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.569
The plan was not to draw attention.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.321
- You speak Spanish?
- Yeah.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.740
Summer bartending at Señor Frog's.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.200
Did you at least get the clue?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.826
Yeah, I think so.

36:44.285 --> 36:45.286
Check it out.

36:55.254 --> 36:57.548
No wonder that record didn't go gold.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.885
Why go through all the trouble
of making a fake gold record?

37:00.885 --> 37:02.386
It has to mean something.

37:02.386 --> 37:04.222
We can mess with it
on some music software.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.724
Try to see if there's a hidden message
or something.

37:07.308 --> 37:08.809
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:08.809 --> 37:10.061
We'll figure it out.

37:33.292 --> 37:36.003
Look at these symbols.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.463
That's Incan.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.634
Oh.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.136
Now these are Aztec.

37:56.857 --> 37:57.942
Mayan.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.486
Mm.

38:09.203 --> 38:12.248
The Daughters of the Plumed Serpent
were here.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.543
I'll get the drone.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.026
Mictlan.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.194
That's a good thing, right?

38:42.194 --> 38:45.614
Well, it's the underworld
of Aztec mythology.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.493
- Oh, damn it.
- Black Hawk down, Nate.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.661
I'll go get it.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.377
Xibalba.

38:58.377 --> 39:00.379
Mayan underworld.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.552
Nate, hang on a moment.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.055
It's okay. I can see the drone.
It's right up there.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.473
Don't take another step.

39:11.557 --> 39:12.725
Nate!

39:12.725 --> 39:15.269
- No, no, no, no, no!
- Nate!

39:15.269 --> 39:16.604
Nate!

39:17.229 --> 39:18.689
- No, no, let me go!
- Let's go.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.358
Let me go! He could still be alive!

39:20.358 --> 39:21.275
No!

39:21.275 --> 39:23.110
Listen to me. Listen to me.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.445
He's gone.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.655
This is all a trap. We need to go.

39:26.655 --> 39:28.157
We need to go right now.

39:28.949 --> 39:30.534
Come on, let's go!

39:39.585 --> 39:40.503
Hey.

39:40.503 --> 39:42.296
Oh, hey, Ethan.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.174
Jess isn't here. She's...

39:45.174 --> 39:46.717
She's working on that sound file.

39:46.717 --> 39:49.929
Yeah, I know.
I came to talk to you, actually.

39:51.722 --> 39:52.807
Okay.

39:53.599 --> 39:58.145
It's unexpected, but I'm listening.

39:59.814 --> 40:02.608
I... I just want to make sure
you understand

40:02.608 --> 40:04.485
how careful we have to be with Jess.

40:05.277 --> 40:07.363
You know, she can't break the law. And...

40:08.072 --> 40:11.325
I watched you lead her into Graceland
to steal a record.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.203
Oh, she led herself.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.247
And I'm not gonna tell a woman
what she can and can't do.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.165
That's not what I'm saying.

40:18.165 --> 40:20.376
I'm just saying we have to look out
for her.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.755
How about I do me, and you do you?

40:25.297 --> 40:27.174
Look, you don't know her.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.510
She's not going to stop.
This is about her family.

40:29.510 --> 40:30.803
It is personal to her.

40:30.803 --> 40:33.139
Yeah, well, this is about my family, too.

40:33.639 --> 40:34.932
All right?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.309
We've both got skin in the game
and we're both gonna have to take risks.

40:37.309 --> 40:40.062
And if you're not cool with that,
then maybe you should bail.

40:40.062 --> 40:42.273
It's not the same for you
as it is for her.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.816
You're not listening to me.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.153
- It's exactly the same--
- She is undocumented.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.992
I shouldn't have said that.

40:54.493 --> 40:55.995
Look, she has DACA.

40:56.954 --> 41:00.124
So if she gets into any trouble,
she can lose her status and be deported.

41:01.041 --> 41:03.127
So it's not as easy as "you do you."

41:10.509 --> 41:11.719
<i>For digital data,</i>

41:11.719 --> 41:14.722
<i>one of the simplest techniques

41:14.722 --> 41:16.056

<i>Decoding...</i>

41:25.816 --> 41:26.859
Hey.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.697
What's wrong?

41:31.697 --> 41:35.409
So I went to tell Liam
he can't be so reckless around you

41:35.409 --> 41:36.619
and it just came out.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.329
What just came out?

41:39.455 --> 41:41.832
I told Liam you have DACA.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.341
Whatever. You told me.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.635
You made a mistake. It's okay.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.804
I know it's not okay.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.682
If I say it's okay, it's okay.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.229
Yeah. Okay.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.565
I'll let you get back
to what you're doing.

42:25.793 --> 42:27.211
Hey, great. Just in time.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.380
I know Ethan told you
about me having DACA.

42:32.258 --> 42:33.842
And I really wish he hadn't.

42:36.804 --> 42:38.389
Now go easy on him.

42:38.973 --> 42:40.766
He was just trying
to have your back.

42:42.059 --> 42:45.145
You guys are obviously really close.

42:45.145 --> 42:46.730
He's my oldest friend.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.151
Which is why he should have known better.

42:58.993 --> 42:59.994
Look...

43:02.162 --> 43:05.666
I... I would have tried to talk you out
of going in there

43:05.666 --> 43:07.293
had I known what you're risking.

43:11.547 --> 43:14.967
See, this is exactly why
I don't tell people right away.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.429
Because it changes how they treat me.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.809
Some tell me to go back to my country
and they call me illegal.

43:25.144 --> 43:31.108
Others have really good intentions
and wanna help and protect me

43:31.108 --> 43:32.693
like I'm a puppy.

43:33.110 --> 43:35.029
- Jess, that's not what I meant.
- I know.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.489
Nobody ever does.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.745
I'm just saying it's really easy for it
to be the only thing

43:42.745 --> 43:44.371
people see about me, but...

43:46.123 --> 43:47.708
It's not who I am.

43:47.708 --> 43:49.126
Then who are you?

43:53.005 --> 43:56.467
If you asked me that a week ago,
I could have answered that.

43:57.134 --> 43:58.344
But now...

43:59.053 --> 44:01.138
everything I thought I knew about my mom,

44:01.722 --> 44:02.765
my dad,

44:03.974 --> 44:05.476
my whole family, for that matter,

44:05.476 --> 44:09.188
is a crazy riddle that can only be solved

44:09.188 --> 44:10.856
by finding this treasure.

44:16.403 --> 44:18.197
You know anything about steganography?

44:19.531 --> 44:21.742
Only that the YouTube videos
are super confusing.

44:27.498 --> 44:32.294
Hey, so I put the audio file you recorded
through a high-pass filter

44:32.294 --> 44:33.879
and shifted the pitch down.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.049
Just listen. Here.

44:39.885 --> 44:41.387
Sorry. Speakers broken.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.436
It sounds like
somebody's talking backwards.

44:50.229 --> 44:51.397
Did you flip it?

44:51.397 --> 44:52.898
I was waiting for you.

44:54.441 --> 44:56.318
All right. Here it goes.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.574
<i>I've got a message
from Miss Morning Dove White.</i>

45:02.574 --> 45:04.827
<i>"The twin-tongued serpent's tail...</i>

45:04.827 --> 45:06.745
<i>...is revealed</i>

45:06.745 --> 45:08.288
-<i>in fair weather...</i>
- That's Elvis.

45:08.288 --> 45:11.166
<i>...by the bend in the new found land."</i>

45:14.128 --> 45:16.004
- Well, play it again.
- Yeah.

45:16.505 --> 45:20.467
<i>I've got a message
from Miss Morning Dove White.</i>

45:20.467 --> 45:24.513
<i>"The twin-tongued serpent's tail
is revealed</i>

45:24.513 --> 45:29.059
<i>in fair weather by the bend
in the new found land."</i>

45:42.406 --> 45:44.408
Maybe there is no treasure.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.912
Maybe the daughters of the Plumed Serpent

45:49.371 --> 45:52.666
just put all these clues out there
to keep the conquistadors busy

45:52.666 --> 45:54.501
and lure them into traps.

46:00.549 --> 46:02.926
Nelson Mandela once said,

46:04.386 --> 46:07.222
"Don't judge me by my success,

46:07.222 --> 46:10.434
judge me by how many times I fall down

46:11.226 --> 46:12.686
and get back up again."

46:16.064 --> 46:18.233
<i>Cras Est Nostrum.</i>

46:21.361 --> 46:23.238
<i>Cras Est Nostrum.</i>

46:26.492 --> 46:27.701
To Nate.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.205
To Nate.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.386
<i>I've got a message
from Miss Morning Dove White.</i>

46:46.386 --> 46:50.682
<i>"The twin-tongued serpent's tail
is revealed</i>

46:50.682 --> 46:55.229
<i>in fair weather by the bend
in the new found land."</i>

46:55.229 --> 46:56.647
Is that...

46:56.647 --> 46:58.148
Elvis?

46:58.941 --> 47:01.985
That is a clue.
