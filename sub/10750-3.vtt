 You wouldn't steal a handbag,

00:40.346 --> 00:43.306
 you wouldn't steal a car,

00:43.705 --> 00:45.205
 you wouldn't steal a baby...

00:45.401 --> 00:48.491
 ...you wouldn't shoot a policeman...

00:48.907 --> 00:51.267
 and then steal his helmet.

00:51.585 --> 00:54.605
 You wouldn't
 go to the toilet in his helmet...

00:55.016 --> 00:59.356
 ...and then send it to the
 policeman's grieving widow

00:59.944 --> 01:01.514
 and then steal it again!

01:01.724 --> 01:07.414
 Downloading films is stealing.

01:08.191 --> 01:11.201
 If you do it you WILL
 face the consequences.

01:11.613 --> 01:18.983
 Man, these anti-piracy ads

 Ahhh.

01:34.203 --> 01:35.593
 I still think we're too close.

01:35.783 --> 01:37.313
 Well, then sit in the sink.

01:37.513 --> 01:39.503
 I'm not sitting in the sink again.

01:39.772 --> 01:41.372
 OK, princess.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.143
 Your flat is way too
 small for this telly

01:44.494 --> 01:45.334
 That's fantastic.

01:45.441 --> 01:48.411
 Ahhh.

01:48.817 --> 01:49.957
 What's wrong now?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.260
 I need to go to the toilet.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.210

02:09.128 --> 02:10.758
 I'm not calling you Dominator, Jeff.

 I'm not calling you Dominator,Jeff.
 But I am Dominator

02:12.535 --> 02:13.785
 Whatever. I won't call you it.

02:13.947 --> 02:15.707
 Forget it. Um now... listen,

02:15.944 --> 02:18.624
 I was just wondering, have
 you seen the new Tarantino film?

02:18.983 --> 02:20.493
 I'm just about to watch it now, Jeff.

02:20.697 --> 02:22.207
 I have already seen it.

02:22.408 --> 02:26.178
 At the end there's
 a very unusual twist.

 Aw!

 Ah no.
 Oh, now I know there's a twist.

02:32.666 --> 02:34.996
 I'm gonna spend the whole
 film guessing what it is.

02:35.309 --> 02:36.509
 Damn you, Dominator.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.210
 Try and forget there's a twist.

 Oh, how can you
 forget there's a twist?

 Oh, what's wrong with it now?

02:43.022 --> 02:45.802
 Oh, come on.
 If I don't see this film today then

02:46.180 --> 02:49.350
 Jeff'll find out some way of telling
 me what the twist is, I know he will.

02:49.785 --> 02:51.575
 Come on! Work!

02:51.815 --> 02:56.185

 talking about? Here, let me help...

03:10.724 --> 03:11.594
 See what, Moss?

03:10.724 --> 03:14.544
 See what, Moss?
 We go to a film, sometimes the pub,
 maybe get some dinner

03:15.068 --> 03:18.348
 but it just goes on and on,
 year in, year out. We're stagnating.

03:18.793 --> 03:20.583
 You make it sound like we're
 an old married couple.

03:18.793 --> 03:21.783
 You make it sound like we're
 an old married couple.
 But we are. Can't you see?

 You're my wife, Roy,
 you're my wife. You're my wife.

03:25.392 --> 03:28.732
 We should be married to ladies
 but we're married to each other.
 You're my wife.

03:29.181 --> 03:30.211
 Could you stop calling me your wife?

03:29.181 --> 03:32.981
 Could you stop calling me your wife?
 You're my wife Roy,

04:46.194 --> 04:48.974
 Yes.
 It's cold, everyone looks oppressed.

04:49.352 --> 04:51.282
 You know,
 I remember when smoking was fun.

04:51.546 --> 04:53.146

05:51.801 --> 05:54.741
 It seems to me the problem is that
 you spend too much time together.

 Yeah.

 Well, to be honest with you,
 he's been making advances.

 asking me if I wanna go

 Is German cuisine not good?

 No. Sounds fine.

 Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.

11:48.544 --> 11:51.604
 Yeah, no, I'm here for the cookery.
 No, no, no, this is the cookery.

11:52.019 --> 11:54.919
 Look, I've got your advert here...

11:55.315 --> 11:55.975
 Yes.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.185
 Yes.
 I printed it out.

11:57.435 --> 11:59.155
 Yes.

11:59.391 --> 12:00.841
 I want to cook with you.

12:01.032 --> 12:03.782
 Ah no, no, my English
 is not so good, um...

12:04.151 --> 12:05.821
 Ohhhh!

12:06.046 --> 12:08.716
 You want to cook with me,
 using me, you mean.

12:09.078 --> 12:10.288
 Ah yes! Yes. You see.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.193
 Oh, yes, yes.

12:12.429 --> 12:14.959
 I see where the confusion was.
 I thought this was a cookery course.

12:12.429 --> 12:17.079
 I see where the confusion was.
 I thought this was a cookery course.
 Hahaha. No, no.

12:17.716 --> 12:20.806
 But you wanted someone who would
 agree to let you kill and eat them.

12:21.222 --> 12:23.082
 Ja,ja. You see?

12:21.222 --> 12:25.422
 Ja,ja. You see?
 That is funny

12:25.993 --> 12:27.253
 Ehh.

12:27.423 --> 12:30.453
 So you're not interested?

12:30.865 --> 12:32.185
 Oh, no, thanks, it's not for me.

12:32.361 --> 12:41.321
 How disappointing.

12:42.549 --> 12:45.349
 I'm sorry, Johan,
 this must be such a let down.

12:45.724 --> 12:49.804
 Had my tonsils out last month,
 I could have kept them.

12:50.363 --> 12:51.643
 Ahh.

12:51.808 --> 12:56.828
 I feel like such a turnip.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.520
 Do you want to watch a film?

12:59.796 --> 13:00.846
 OK.

13:00.985 --> 13:02.185
 I have Oceans Eleven.

13:02.346 --> 13:05.026
 Original or remake?

13:05.388 --> 13:09.368
 Well, yeah, you could come over here,
 we could put on some music,

13:09.911 --> 13:12.591
 I could give you a back rub,
 see what happens.

13:12.953 --> 13:16.013
 Oh, no, wait, I've got this guy
 coming over to watch a DVD.

13:16.425 --> 13:17.905
 Another time, maybe. OK.

13:18.104 --> 13:20.184
 Oh, and some chicken wings, please.
 Thank you.

13:20.464 --> 13:22.604
 DOORBELL

13:22.891 --> 13:24.211
 Ah!

13:24.387 --> 13:28.207
 # There's somebody at the door,
 there's somebody at the door

13:28.726 --> 13:30.486
 # There's somebody at the door. #

13:30.721 --> 13:35.501
 Hey, it's my G.

13:36.153 --> 13:39.663
 Um, I'm really sorry I was late.
 It was...

13:40.146 --> 13:44.066
 It's cool. Hey, you know, we should
 do this sort of thing more often.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.000
 I hate the whole boss/employee
 thing, don't you?

13:47.327 --> 13:48.467
 Yeah.

13:48.624 --> 13:51.574
 You wanna seal the deal
 with a high five?

13:48.624 --> 13:52.804
 You wanna seal the deal
 with a high five?
 Yes.

13:53.376 --> 13:54.946
 (LAUGHS)

13:55.156 --> 13:57.836
 So, what are we watching?

13:55.156 --> 14:02.406
 So, what are we watching?
 It's a Tarantino production
 south Korea zombie movie

14:03.402 --> 14:04.402
 Wow!

14:04.532 --> 14:07.002
 I didn't know there was
 a south Korea. OK, put it on.

14:07.339 --> 14:10.649
 I've ordered pizza and chicken wings

14:11.097 --> 14:13.217
 and there's a cooler beside you,
 so help yourself to beer.

14:11.097 --> 14:15.387
 and there's a cooler beside you,
 so help yourself to beer.
 Don't mind if I do.

14:15.971 --> 14:19.131
 FILM STARTS

14:19.559 --> 14:28.009
 Oh, I've heard of this flick.
 There's a twist in it, isn't there?

14:29.172 --> 14:30.732
 Yeah.

14:30.945 --> 14:33.195
 Just... just try and

14:33.494 --> 14:37.704
 Forget that and hopefully
 we'll still be able to enjoy it.

14:38.276 --> 14:41.616
 I bet he's a woman, that bloke.
 No, you think it's the future,

14:42.065 --> 14:43.885
 but it's actually set in the past.

14:44.126 --> 14:45.646
 It's not Earth.

14:45.855 --> 14:47.105
 It's all a dream.

14:47.267 --> 14:50.197
 Oh, could you not...
 could you... could you not try and

14:50.592 --> 14:54.582
 guess what the twist is? It's just
 that might get a little annoying.

14:55.126 --> 14:58.146
 But isn't that half the fun,
 trying to guess the twist?

14:58.553 --> 15:01.073
 Er, personally, I think it...

15:01.414 --> 15:04.324
 it kind of, it ruins the fun.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.250
 Well, I think it makes it more fun.

15:06.451 --> 15:08.371
 It's just I don't.

15:08.626 --> 15:12.396
 Well, I do and I'm the boss.

15:12.914 --> 15:16.074
 I'm your boss.

15:16.505 --> 15:18.425
 (IMITATES GUNSHOT)

15:18.683 --> 15:25.583
 They're all clones.
 He's his own brother.

15:26.531 --> 15:28.491
 Everyone's a ghost.

15:28.757 --> 15:29.947
 Have you still not
 seen the film yet?

15:28.757 --> 15:31.097
 Have you still not
 seen the film yet?
 No.

15:31.415 --> 15:33.905
 What's that?

15:34.248 --> 15:35.778
 What?

15:35.987 --> 15:39.077
 It's cold and I'm going out
 for a cigarette.

15:39.494 --> 15:41.634
 Morning.
 Oh, you must be Jen's mother.

15:41.921 --> 15:44.831
 What a night I had last night.

15:45.231 --> 15:46.841
 Oh, yes, the cookery, how was it?

15:47.057 --> 15:51.247
 I am so embarrassed,
 I cannot tell you.

15:51.814 --> 15:52.984
 What happened?

15:53.141 --> 15:55.391
 It wasn't a cookery class at all.

15:55.699 --> 15:57.079
 What was it?

15:57.265 --> 15:59.125
 He wrote it down wrong,
 cos his English isn't very good.

15:57.265 --> 16:00.755
 He wrote it down wrong,
 cos his English isn't very good.
 Always the way.

16:01.236 --> 16:04.076
 And it turns out he didn't
 want to teach me how to cook...

16:01.236 --> 16:05.596
 And it turns out he didn't
 want to teach me how to cook...
(THEY GIGGLE)

16:06.191 --> 16:07.851
 He wanted to cook me.

16:08.074 --> 16:10.164
 THEY LAUGH

16:10.445 --> 16:13.655
 THEY STOP LAUGHING

16:14.093 --> 16:15.873
 What?

16:16.108 --> 16:18.118
 He wanted to eat me.

16:18.390 --> 16:22.490
 I know - egg and my face
 were in alignment.

16:23.046 --> 16:26.326
 He wanted to eat you?

16:26.771 --> 16:27.771
 Yes.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.129
 Oh!

16:29.295 --> 16:30.955
 He's one of those German cannibals

16:31.174 --> 16:34.584
 He is and he was such a nice man.

16:35.048 --> 16:36.048
 Oh, was he?

16:36.177 --> 16:38.767
 Yeah. He was a fine young cannibal.

16:39.120 --> 16:43.740
 Hang on, hang on, he...
 he... he wanted to eat you.

16:44.375 --> 16:46.235
 Yeah, keep up Jen.

16:46.491 --> 16:48.961
 So we had a laugh about it
 and in the end I didn't

16:49.295 --> 16:52.535
 really feel like being eaten,
 so we just watched Ocean's Eleven.

16:52.974 --> 16:53.934
 Ah. Original or remake?

16:52.974 --> 16:56.404
 Ah. Original or remake?
 Is that really the
 most important question?

16:56.872 --> 16:59.852
 I... I...hang on, you watched a...
 you watched a film with him? Yes.

17:00.262 --> 17:01.392
 With the man that wanted to eat you?

17:00.262 --> 17:02.732
 With the man that wanted to eat you?
 Who else?

17:03.071 --> 17:04.330
 Why didn't you call the police?

17:03.071 --> 17:05.721
 Why didn't you call the police?
 Why would I call the police?

17:06.084 --> 17:07.644
 He wanted to eat you!

17:07.858 --> 17:11.038
 Only with my consent and, believe me,
 my consent was not forthcoming.

17:11.465 --> 17:12.626
 Good for you, Moss.

17:12.780 --> 17:15.760
 But, eh...
 eating people is illegal.

17:16.170 --> 17:17.730
 Only without their consent.

17:17.934 --> 17:19.184
 No, Moss, no, no, no.

17:19.345 --> 17:20.755
 It's a grey area, give me that.

17:20.942 --> 17:23.051
 I knew something was askew.

17:23.336 --> 17:24.906
 Whoever heard of German food?!

17:25.112 --> 17:27.732
 But you should see his place,
 it's incredible.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.078
 He's got a great system, 50 inch TV.

17:30.348 --> 17:31.638
 Really?

17:31.813 --> 17:36.323
 Maybe we could watch
 the film at his place!

17:31.813 --> 17:37.403
 Maybe we could watch
 the film at his place!
 Oh, I don't know Roy,

17:38.162 --> 17:40.722
 he's only really interested
 in people he can eventually eat.

17:38.162 --> 17:42.782
 he's only really interested
 in people he can eventually eat.
 Ahh. Tell him he can eat me!

17:43.416 --> 17:46.206
 Are... are you insane?
 You've got to call the police.

17:46.589 --> 17:50.029
 Oh, Jen,
 don't be such an old fuddy-duddy.

17:50.499 --> 17:52.279
 The world has changed.

17:52.523 --> 17:56.193
 If two grown men can't make
 a pervert happy for a few minutes

17:56.697 --> 17:59.597
 in order to watch a film
 about zombies then maybe

17:59.988 --> 18:02.838
 we should all just move to Iran.

18:03.230 --> 18:06.570
 I don't know, Roy, it does seem
 a little immoral to mislead him.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.069
 But then, as Jen pointed out earlier,

18:09.347 --> 18:12.377
 being a cannibal's
 a little immoral too.

18:12.785 --> 18:15.645
 I'm in an ethical pickle.

18:16.029 --> 18:18.859
 Turns out meeting new people
 is a lot more complicated than

18:19.245 --> 18:20.905
 I'd originally thought.

18:21.132 --> 18:27.142
 Psst, Jen.

18:27.963 --> 18:29.313
 Yorg.

18:29.495 --> 18:32.595
 You cannot smoke here. They are
 moving us to a new smoking area.

18:33.015 --> 18:34.545
 Oh, so the rumours were true.

18:34.746 --> 18:36.076
 Quickly, before they see you.

19:24.865 --> 19:31.225
 Jen, what are you doing?

19:32.092 --> 19:33.812
 It's over, Yorg.

19:34.041 --> 19:36.131
 We must fight them Jen

19:36.415 --> 19:39.765
 We must all fight them. We must
 keep smoking until the bitter end.

19:40.220 --> 19:43.310
 Yorg. Yorg, such fire.

19:43.727 --> 19:47.827
 I am too tired for revolution.

19:48.380 --> 19:51.500
 And we've walked (BLEEP) miles.

19:51.924 --> 19:55.094
 Goodbye, Yorg.

19:55.530 --> 20:01.990
 Taxi!

20:02.877 --> 20:04.807
 Let's not fight again.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.741
 No. And look, we're out,
 we're meeting people.

20:09.244 --> 20:10.874
 Yes.

20:11.088 --> 20:12.368
 Ah?

20:12.535 --> 20:16.475
 You were a bit wonky.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.797
 Thanks, dear.

20:19.034 --> 20:21.154
 Hello! Hello!

20:21.445 --> 20:23.275
 Hello! How wonderful!

20:23.521 --> 20:25.341
 Johan, this is Roy.
 Roy, this is Johan.

20:25.584 --> 20:27.724
 Hello Johan. I... I brought dessert.

20:28.009 --> 20:31.359
 Ahh! Come in. Come in. Ja.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.755
 Oh, this is lovely...

20:34.012 --> 20:36.232
 Yes. Yes. Lovely.

20:36.537 --> 20:39.887
 Oh, isn't this nice.

20:40.345 --> 20:43.955
 OK, so we'll watch the film, then
 I'll tell him I changed my mind.

20:44.450 --> 20:45.520
 Ahh!

20:45.662 --> 20:49.742
 Lovely and...
 Oh, wow, now that's a guitar.

20:50.299 --> 20:53.019
 So, Roy, ha...

20:53.391 --> 20:56.641
 has Moss explained to you my,
 um... desires.

20:57.082 --> 20:58.192
 He has indeed.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.604
 And are you interested?

20:59.775 --> 21:01.175
 I'm very interested.

21:01.362 --> 21:02.762
 Ah, splendid!

21:02.951 --> 21:06.391
 Yes. Moss, if you will excuse us.
 Do you eat in here?

21:06.855 --> 21:07.865
 Yes, this way please.

21:06.855 --> 21:09.375
 Yes, this way please.
 Ahh

21:09.714 --> 21:12.414
 But, Roy, didn't you want to
 watch this film that I have here?

21:12.775 --> 21:16.565
 Ooh, I'd completely forgotten.

21:17.079 --> 21:20.429
 There was that film that I wanted
 to watch before Johan ate me.

21:20.887 --> 21:22.487
 That's right.

21:22.698 --> 21:24.218
 There it is there now.

21:24.425 --> 21:25.275
 Yes.

21:24.425 --> 21:26.595
 Yes.
 So you want to watch a film?

21:26.887 --> 21:27.907
 Yes, thanks.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.190
 Is that OK?

21:29.345 --> 21:31.275
 Er... Yes, yes, of course.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.800
 I'll put it on.

21:32.970 --> 21:38.350
 Is it very long?

21:39.089 --> 21:40.219
 Two hours, 20.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.187
 Ohhh.

21:41.298 --> 21:46.778
 Mmm, no, I'll wait.

21:47.532 --> 21:50.572
 TV: 'You wouldn't steal a handbag...'

21:50.988 --> 21:52.348
 Oh, these piracy warnings...

21:50.988 --> 21:54.088
 Oh, these piracy warnings...
 Tell me about it.

21:50.988 --> 21:55.028
 Oh,these piracy warnings...
 Tell me about it.
 DOORBELL

21:55.577 --> 21:57.287
 Ah, what now?

21:57.521 --> 22:03.561
 'You wouldn't shoot a policeman,
 then steal his helmet...'

22:04.387 --> 22:05.297
 Hello, there.

22:05.418 --> 22:06.688
 Yes, can I help you?

22:06.862 --> 22:07.822
 Police! Don't move!

22:07.944 --> 22:08.844
 Ah, ah. Don't move!

22:08.959 --> 22:15.879
 If my mouther thinks I'm a cannibal,
 I'll be for the high jump

22:08.959 --> 22:18.229
 If my mouther thinks I'm a cannibal,
 I'll be for the high jump
 For once, can we please
 not bring your mother into it.

22:19.497 --> 22:20.377
 Oh, here we go again.

22:19.497 --> 22:21.207
 Oh, here we go again.
 DOOR SLAMS

22:21.442 --> 22:28.972
 Well, boys,

22:30.001 --> 22:32.871
 we're in a bit of a
 sticky situation, aren't we?

22:33.266 --> 22:38.946
 Where d'you get this film?

22:39.727 --> 22:44.497
 This is an illegal copy of a film.

22:45.144 --> 22:49.124
 Ohh, um...

22:49.666 --> 22:51.916
 Are you not worried that
 we might be cannibals?

22:52.225 --> 22:53.795
 Cannibals?

22:54.005 --> 22:58.115
 The man who was with us
 is a cannibal.

22:58.674 --> 23:00.154
 He was going to eat me.

23:00.353 --> 23:03.883
 Well, it's not really my area.
 I do copyright violation, that sort

23:04.358 --> 23:07.048
 of thing, but I'll let someone know.
 Thanks. Anyway...

23:07.418 --> 23:08.958
 Where d'you get this?

23:09.164 --> 23:14.994
 Interesting film.

23:15.796 --> 23:18.696
 Who'd have thought at the end
 that bloke turned out to be the...
