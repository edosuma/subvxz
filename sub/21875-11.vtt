I can't believe I let you talk

The spirits must know you still
have the heart of a warrior.

00:14.340 --> 00:17.680
Well, I sure wouldn't wanna
disappoint the spirits.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.650
I wouldn't make fun

Don't you think the spirits
are happy now, Uncle Ray?

02:11.660 --> 02:14.490
I told you not to make fun
of the spirits, Washoe.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.930
Just for that, you go
to the sweat lodge
and cleanse your soul.

02:16.930 --> 02:17.930

03:18.190 --> 03:19.560

03:19.560 --> 03:20.690
I gotta tell you,
Walker,

03:20.700 --> 03:22.430
I'm really looking
forward to this, man.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.660
Are you sure
about that?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.500
Yeah, I'm sure.
W-why wouldn't I be sure?

Well, you know, a sweat lodge
isn't for everyone.

No, no, no. It's not like

04:38.640 --> 04:39.970
No. I'm just gettin'

had anything to do with that--

13:43.490 --> 13:45.780
I don't know, partner.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.120
Those two mixed up in a murder,

13:47.120 --> 13:48.720
that doesn't seem possible
to me.

13:49.890 --> 13:50.890
( van engine starts )

13:50.890 --> 13:52.360
There she is.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.160
( tires squeal )

13:58.170 --> 13:59.170
What the hell?

13:59.170 --> 14:00.470

14:00.470 --> 14:01.630
Come here.

14:02.540 --> 14:03.700
( engine starts )

14:19.120 --> 14:21.820
A lot of excitement for
such a quiet little street.

15:58.850 --> 16:00.420
Got her!
Come on!

16:00.420 --> 16:02.220
Get out!
Come on!

16:04.330 --> 16:05.960
Let's go.
Down here.

16:11.170 --> 16:12.830
Go that way.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.500
( gunshot )

16:17.540 --> 16:18.540
( grunts )

16:22.410 --> 16:23.410
( grunts )

16:27.110 --> 16:30.120
Good. Good, good,
good, good job.

16:30.750 --> 16:31.750
You okay?

16:31.750 --> 16:33.220
I'm
all right.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.430
BOY:
Mom, come here.

16:43.430 --> 16:45.460
Sally, if you won't tell us
where David is,

16:45.470 --> 16:47.700
we can't help him.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.240
( sighs )

16:52.840 --> 16:54.570
I don't know what I should do.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.080
I swore I wouldn't tell.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.710
Well, at least
tell us what happened.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.080
Why is he hiding?

16:59.080 --> 17:02.920
David saw them murder my uncle.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.750
And the men who did it saw him.

17:05.750 --> 17:08.550
And they knew his name.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.920
And they shot at him,

17:10.930 --> 17:14.260
and he got scared, and he ran.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.930
Why did they try to kidnap you?

17:17.329 --> 17:19.030
I don't know.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.800
Listen, Sally,

17:23.800 --> 17:25.440
whoever these guys are,

17:25.440 --> 17:28.640
they must think you and David
have something they want,

17:28.640 --> 17:31.310
and they're not gonna stop
until they get it.

17:31.310 --> 17:33.480
( knock at door )

17:34.750 --> 17:36.550
They're not talkin'.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.080
Both of 'em have priors,

17:41.960 --> 17:43.860
ALEX:
Sally,

17:43.860 --> 17:46.860
you have to tell us
where David is.

17:50.830 --> 17:53.070
Okay.

17:53.070 --> 17:56.640
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

( knocking )

19:07.880 --> 19:08.870
SALLY:
David?

19:08.880 --> 19:10.680
David, it's me.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.720
You weren't supposed
to tell anybody where I was.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.860
Some men tried
to kidnap me today.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.330
WALKER:
If you're in trouble, David,

19:28.330 --> 19:30.060
why didn't you call me?

19:30.060 --> 19:31.300
I'm sorry. I--

19:31.300 --> 19:33.870
I was just scared.
I-I must have panicked.

19:33.870 --> 19:36.670
Okay. Just tell me
what happened.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.970
The other night,
when I left the res,

19:38.970 --> 19:40.610
there was a car
stopped in the road, and--

19:40.610 --> 19:42.580
And I slowed down.

19:42.580 --> 19:45.040
And then Charlie came out
of the trees, and he was shot.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.610
And I-- I tried
to help him. I--

19:46.610 --> 19:49.080
He was dying.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.980
And he gave me a key.

19:50.990 --> 19:52.020
He wanted me to take it.

19:52.020 --> 19:53.290
And then somebody

19:53.290 --> 19:54.550
started shootin' at me.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.790
I couldn't see their faces,
but they knew who I was.

19:56.790 --> 19:58.790
They called me by name.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.190
They must think I saw them.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.290
He gave you a key?
Where is it?

20:06.630 --> 20:09.070
DAVID:
He didn't say much. He just
told me to take it and go.

20:09.070 --> 20:11.240
Safe deposit box key.

20:11.240 --> 20:13.210
Yeah. Must be
what they're after.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.540
Must be pretty dang important
to kill for.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.580
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

20:30.590 --> 20:35.660
( both speaking
in Cherokee )

20:42.270 --> 20:46.100
( speaking in Cherokee )

20:47.780 --> 20:51.840
RAY ( translating ):
There was once a young boy
named Running Bear.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.810
He was much like you.

20:53.820 --> 20:56.820
<i> He wanted to fly</i>
<i> like an eagle,</i>

20:56.820 --> 21:00.650
<i> so every day,</i>
<i> he would watch the eagle,</i>

21:00.650 --> 21:03.120
<i> study his every movement.</i>

21:03.120 --> 21:05.960
<i> And the eagle</i>
<i> would call to him:</i>

21:05.960 --> 21:07.360
<i> "Come join me.</i>

21:07.360 --> 21:09.460
<i> Leave this place.</i>
<i> Leave your people."</i>

21:09.460 --> 21:12.830
<i> And everyone thought</i>
<i> Running Bear was foolish,</i>

21:12.830 --> 21:16.670
<i> to think he could fly.</i>

21:16.670 --> 21:21.340
<i> But soon, the eagle's voice</i>
<i> was the only voice he heard.</i>

21:21.340 --> 21:24.940
<i> And it was then</i>
<i> that he flew away forever.</i>

21:24.950 --> 21:26.450
(<i> echoing</i> )

21:30.080 --> 21:32.450
How can I make him
understand?

21:32.450 --> 21:34.850
I have to live my life
the way I see it.

21:35.790 --> 21:38.120
Just give him time.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.500
MAN:
All right!

21:51.270 --> 21:52.340
MAN:
Hey.

21:52.340 --> 21:53.840
MAN 2:
I got it. I got it. I got it.

21:56.810 --> 21:57.880
Ray,

21:57.880 --> 21:59.110
You and Two Horses
go on in.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.350
David and I are
goin' for a walk.

22:00.350 --> 22:01.680
Okay.

22:06.290 --> 22:09.150
Let's go see if we can
find that voice.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.690
Hey, Eddie.

22:15.860 --> 22:18.860
(<i> tense theme playing</i> )

22:44.460 --> 22:45.720
I'm sorry.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.330
This is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

22:48.330 --> 22:50.130
So you're sure none
of the men we've talked to

22:50.130 --> 22:51.360
sounded like the guy?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.400
Positive, but there--
There was something familiar

22:53.400 --> 22:54.630
about his voice.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.100
I just can't place it.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.540
Hey, there, Davey boy.

22:58.510 --> 22:59.840
Thought you was too good for us.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.010
Knock it off, Eddie.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.070
Now that Charlie's gone,

23:02.080 --> 23:03.610
somebody's gotta
keep you in line.

23:03.610 --> 23:05.040
Hey, back off.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.350
What is this,
a joke?

23:06.350 --> 23:08.310
Davey "Puny Eagle" comes back
to the reservation

23:08.320 --> 23:10.350
and brings a Texas Ranger
to fight for him?

23:10.350 --> 23:12.350
He has as much right here
as any of ya.

23:12.350 --> 23:13.650
No way, man.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.790
Yeah, he's off res now.

23:15.790 --> 23:16.920
He disowned us.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.360
We disown him.

23:18.360 --> 23:20.890
We got our own rules
around here, Ranger.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.030
"Puny Eagle" here

23:22.030 --> 23:23.830
thinks he's too good
to play by 'em.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.430
Why don't you ask him about
Charlie "Three Feathers."

23:26.430 --> 23:28.100
Yeah.
They hated each other, man.

23:28.100 --> 23:29.470
Maybe he offed him.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.810
Wasn't any of them.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.110
Are you sure?

23:36.680 --> 23:38.080
What wasn't any of us?

23:41.480 --> 23:42.480
Hey!

23:42.480 --> 23:45.120
What wasn't any of us?

23:51.730 --> 23:54.090
Yeah, I think we finally got
a match on our key.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.100
Great. Where?
<i> Uh...</i>

23:56.100 --> 23:57.360
Multinational Bank.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.100
Alex is workin' on the warrant
right now.

23:59.100 --> 24:00.930
I'll be right there.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.570
Thank you.

24:02.570 --> 24:03.570
Any time, Ranger.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.800
What did you find out,
nephew?

24:04.810 --> 24:07.240
Trivette has a lead
on the safety deposit box.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.080
David, I want you to stay here
and keep your ears open, okay?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.380
Uncle Ray,
keep an eye on him.

24:11.380 --> 24:12.740
I'll keep
an eye on him.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.080
Okay, and I'll see
you guys later.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.580
Good.

25:13.210 --> 25:15.410

"Three Feathers" Wilson.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.540
You have the right
to remain silent.

Anything you say can and will
be used against you

25:36.300 --> 25:37.760
It's not true.
I didn't kill Charlie.

Tell it to the judge,
son.

Trivette.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.000
Yeah.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.400
Pick up Sally
and take her to C.D.'s,

26:13.400 --> 26:14.670
and have Alex
meet us there.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.200
All right.
Why? What's going on?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.570
The FBI's arrested David

26:17.570 --> 26:19.500
for the murder
of Charlie "Three Feathers."

26:19.510 --> 26:21.070
Okay.

Hey, Alex.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.750
Alex.

26:33.390 --> 26:36.020
How's the warrant coming
on that safety deposit box?

26:36.020 --> 26:38.420
I was just going down to Mabel's
office to check on it.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.090
Well, she's gonna need
to speed things up.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.090
Something happen?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.590
Yeah. Walker just called.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.460
FBI arrested David
for Sally's uncle's murder.

26:44.470 --> 26:45.930
Why?

26:45.930 --> 26:48.270
I don't know,
but I'm willing to lay odds

26:48.270 --> 26:50.440
that the answer's in that
safety deposit box.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.400
I'll get right on it.

26:52.410 --> 26:53.570
I'm gonna go pick up
Sally now.

to meet him at C.D.'s.

Come on, David.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.190
You got the wrong guy.
I didn't do anything.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.460
Shut up,
Little Eagle.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.200
It's you, isn't it?

You're the guys
that killed Charlie.

Score one for the Indians.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.340
But I didn't see--
I didn't see anything. I--

27:26.340 --> 27:28.010
I didn't even know
who you were.

27:28.010 --> 27:29.640
Well,
I guess you do now.

You heard the man.
Go for it. Come on. Run.

27:38.390 --> 27:39.520
You're gonna let me go?

27:46.530 --> 27:47.890
You're gonna shoot me,
aren't you?

27:49.400 --> 27:51.400
I'm afraid so, but...

27:51.400 --> 27:54.330
we're gonna give you the chance
to run for it.

27:54.330 --> 27:55.430
Yeah. Go on.
Get out of here.

27:55.440 --> 27:56.870
Go on, run.

27:58.270 --> 27:59.340
I won't do it.

27:59.340 --> 28:01.710
I'm gonna count to three.

28:01.710 --> 28:02.980
Then I pull the trigger.

What's the problem
here?

28:24.430 --> 28:27.930
Problem?
You're the damn problem.

28:27.930 --> 28:30.200
Sanders, FBI.
My prisoner's escaping,

28:30.200 --> 28:32.040
and you're in my way--
Why'd you stop your car?

28:32.040 --> 28:33.910
Jumped out.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.370
He's gone.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.010
Let's go find him.

29:27.830 --> 29:29.330
No luck, huh?

29:29.330 --> 29:31.860
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.770
And I'm warning you,
you stay out of my way.

29:33.770 --> 29:36.070
I didn't know
I was in your way.

29:37.610 --> 29:38.600
You mind?

29:43.210 --> 29:45.840
I wanna know what evidence
you have on the boy.

29:45.850 --> 29:48.210
This is my jurisdiction.
I don't have to tell you.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.480
No, you don't
have to tell me,

29:50.480 --> 29:53.020
but I strongly
suggest you do.

29:53.020 --> 29:54.850
Okay, okay.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.890
We, uh, found something
in the kid's apartment.

29:56.890 --> 29:57.890
What?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.690
It's none of your business,
Ranger.

30:04.330 --> 30:06.160
( car starts )

30:21.580 --> 30:23.310
Now, that is
the damnedest thing

30:23.320 --> 30:24.520
I ever heard in my life.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.550
Two FBI agents
arrest a kid.

30:26.550 --> 30:28.390
He jumps out of the car
and disappears.

30:28.390 --> 30:30.060
No.

30:30.060 --> 30:32.120
There's just something weird
about that.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.130
You're right, C.D.

30:34.130 --> 30:36.700
That's why I let David
get away from 'em.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.960
There's something about these
two guys I just don't trust.

30:38.970 --> 30:40.900
You think they're dirty?

30:40.900 --> 30:42.730
It's possible.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.440
You go back
and look for David?

30:44.440 --> 30:47.410
Yeah, I went back looking
for him after they left,

30:47.410 --> 30:48.570
but it got too dark.

30:49.810 --> 30:51.280
Don't worry.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.840
I'm not gonna get
any closer

30:52.850 --> 30:54.310
to your ugly hide
than I have to.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.980
I'm here to see Walker.

30:55.980 --> 30:57.050
Mabel, I-- Uh-- Uh--

30:57.050 --> 30:59.320
Don't you speak to me.

30:59.320 --> 31:00.550
You--

31:00.550 --> 31:03.090
You made yourself
perfectly clear.

31:03.090 --> 31:04.320
You do not want me.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.160
Well, you just don't
have to bother yourself.

31:06.160 --> 31:07.160
Honey, look, I--

31:07.160 --> 31:09.430
Don't "honey" me,
either!

31:09.430 --> 31:12.000
I checked that
FBI warrant for you.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.770
Seems the agents claim
they found the dead guy's wallet

31:14.770 --> 31:16.000
in the kid's apartment.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.540

31:17.540 --> 31:20.370
Don't you whistle
at me, neither.

31:20.370 --> 31:22.710
See you later,
sweetheart.

31:22.710 --> 31:23.710
Mwah.

31:23.710 --> 31:24.710
( scoffs )

31:24.710 --> 31:25.710
WALKER:
Thanks, Mabel.

31:27.350 --> 31:28.510
MABEL:
Howdy.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.180
Hey, Mabel.

31:30.920 --> 31:32.350
Where is David?

31:33.550 --> 31:35.190
I'm not sure,
Sally.

31:39.160 --> 31:41.890
I checked on those guys
who picked up David.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.290
Sanders has been
on the reservation

31:43.300 --> 31:46.770
for about ten years,
and Brody about five.

31:46.770 --> 31:48.500
What's going on,
Walker?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.130
I don't know.

31:51.470 --> 31:52.740
Hey.

31:52.740 --> 31:54.510
The warrant's
been approved.

31:54.510 --> 31:56.280
We can open up
the safety deposit box.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.680
C.D., will you keep
an eye on Sally?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.450
Yeah. Both of 'em.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.980
Okay, why don't you two
open the safety deposit box.

32:03.980 --> 32:05.280
I'm gonna go
look for David.

32:05.290 --> 32:08.290
It's a pretty big country
out there, partner.

32:08.290 --> 32:10.920
Unless he comes in on his own,
it's gonna be awful tough.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.030
I'll find him.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.970
WOMAN:
There's a private room

32:24.970 --> 32:26.640
just outside the vault.

32:27.310 --> 32:28.510
Thank you.

32:42.390 --> 32:43.490
All right, counselor.

32:43.490 --> 32:44.720
Okay.

32:45.990 --> 32:47.490
What have we got?

32:53.200 --> 32:54.300
I know this guy.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.700
SALLY:
Arthur Claybrook.

32:55.700 --> 32:57.740
He's a big tycoon,
right?

32:57.740 --> 32:59.140
He owns mines.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.810
It'll take a while to get
through all of this stuff.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.880
Looks like we better
get started.

stinks to high heaven.

34:27.460 --> 34:29.830
I've said it once.
I'm gonna say it again:

34:29.830 --> 34:31.800
these guys are dirty.

34:31.800 --> 34:34.429
They're as dirty
as a Houston ship channel.

34:34.429 --> 34:36.630
How they slipped through
the cracks of the FBI,

34:36.639 --> 34:38.500
I will never know.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.510
According to this diary,

34:40.510 --> 34:43.510
Charlie suspected things were
going on about a year ago.

34:43.510 --> 34:44.610
C.D.:
But what?

34:44.610 --> 34:46.739
Why did they kill the guy?

34:46.750 --> 34:50.719
Because he found out
exactly what they were up to.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.880
It's all a bunch
of legal mumbo jumbo,

34:52.889 --> 34:54.889
that's what that is.

34:56.860 --> 34:58.790
You believe that?

35:01.930 --> 35:03.830
What's it say?

35:10.440 --> 35:11.900
Damn it, Jimmy,
what does it say?

35:21.010 --> 35:23.750
I hope the vision I saw
was real, Uncle Ray.

Washoe.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.050
Well, there's nothing else
I can do.

35:29.060 --> 35:31.160
The knowledge will be
in your footsteps.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.920
The wind and the eagle
will guide you.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.260
The spirits will
take care of you.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.490
You've never been wrong yet,
Uncle Ray.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.310
Some beautiful people we're
dealing with here, Walker.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.050
Our friends,
Sanders and Brody,

35:54.050 --> 35:57.080
they're working for this guy,
Arthur Claybrook.

35:57.080 --> 36:00.090
He owns, or has interest in,
mines all over the world.

36:00.090 --> 36:05.720
Gold, silver, titanium,
cobalt, uranium,

36:05.730 --> 36:07.660
a new vein of which
was recently discovered.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.660
Guess where.

36:08.660 --> 36:09.730
On the reservation.

36:09.730 --> 36:11.230
You got it.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.770
All right, here's the scheme
they're tryin' to pull.

36:13.770 --> 36:15.600
Claybrook owns
most of the land

36:15.600 --> 36:17.700
bordering the east side
of this reservation

36:17.700 --> 36:19.170
where the vein was found,
all right.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.740
And Sanders has
a brother-in-law

36:20.740 --> 36:23.340
who works in the county
assessor's office.

36:23.340 --> 36:26.680
Claybrook paid this guy
to redraw the property lines

36:26.680 --> 36:28.810
so he could open a mine,

36:28.820 --> 36:30.210
and then he paid
Sanders and Brody

36:30.220 --> 36:31.850
to make sure
nobody found out.

36:31.850 --> 36:32.920
Whew.

36:32.920 --> 36:35.090
Charlie did,
and he had the proof,

36:35.090 --> 36:36.350
and that's why they killed him.

36:36.360 --> 36:39.590
And they'll kill David
if they can find him.

36:39.590 --> 36:42.190
Is, uh, Alex
working on the warrants?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.700
Yeah.
She's with the judge right now.

36:43.700 --> 36:45.960
Okay, why don't you
go down there and wait with her.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.330
I'll see if I can find David.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.500
You know where he's at?

36:48.500 --> 36:49.570
Washoe had a vision.

36:49.570 --> 36:51.270
What?

36:51.270 --> 36:52.900
It's worth a try.
