02:41.028 --> 02:43.362

Well, that's funny.

That looks like
a little baby version of Todd,

02:46.634 --> 02:48.767
even has the little
mustache there.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.869
We should talk.

a way for us to have a baby.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.175

02:56.177 --> 02:57.776
Well, I took
a little initiative,

02:57.778 --> 02:59.478
and I talked to Todd,

02:59.480 --> 03:03.549
and he graciously agreed
to be a sperm donor for us.

03:03.551 --> 03:05.117
Oh, my God, that's great.

03:05.119 --> 03:07.986
(laughing):
Okay, I'm so relieved.

03:07.988 --> 03:10.689
I just, I thought for sure
you would be angry

03:10.691 --> 03:12.858
about another man
performing the nasty

03:12.860 --> 03:13.892

03:13.894 --> 03:15.727
W-wait, uh, t-the nasty?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.564
I-I thought we were talking
turkey baster here, Carol.

03:18.566 --> 03:20.165
Statistically speaking,

03:20.167 --> 03:23.001
the best way for Todd's product
to gain purchase in my egg

03:23.003 --> 03:24.803
would be the old-fashioned way.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.005
Don't you think you should have
asked me about this first?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.974
I mean, this is
you having sex with Todd.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.509
Well, there is Mike.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.544
No, absolutely not.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.713
My own brother, Carol?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.081
Well, re-enter Todd.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.583
Pun intended.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.351
(sighs):
I don't know, Carol.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.986
And first and foremost,
I don't know

03:40.988 --> 03:43.822
if I can stomach letting
another man at your privates.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.358
But, man, we really
do want a child,

03:46.360 --> 03:48.393
and it's a dead-end street
with my guys.

03:48.395 --> 03:49.861
Although what if you somehow

03:49.863 --> 03:51.897
fell for him.

03:51.899 --> 03:55.434
Ah, you're not gonna
fall for Todd.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.869
But he is on kind of a roll.

03:57.871 --> 03:58.870
No.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.505
I can't think that way.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.642
This is a chance
to keep civilization going.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.779
Let's do this, Carol.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.114
Really?

04:09.116 --> 04:11.350
Let's have Todd
put my baby in you.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.734
Yeah. What do you want to do?

04:28.736 --> 04:30.135
Well, I-I mean,
I'd do "Falling Slowly."

What? What are you talk...

04:38.212 --> 04:39.578

were doing great.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.946
Oh, we are, never better,

04:40.948 --> 04:42.914
but, you know,
she's getting married to Todd.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.583
What?

04:44.585 --> 04:45.917
Hold on, I-I feel like
I'm missing something here.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.787
Oh, yeah, uh,
we're having a baby.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.455
Wildly lost at this point.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.958
Okay, it-it'll be my baby,
but it's Todd's.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.593
Uh-huh.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.928
In space, you get disoriented,
but I feel like

04:56.930 --> 04:57.929
this is like...

04:57.931 --> 04:59.431
You know I'm sterile, right?

04:59.433 --> 05:01.466
I did not know that.
I should have led with that.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.602
Yeah, no, that's a pretty
natural opener, yeah.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.770
Anyway, big-time blanks
down there,

05:04.772 --> 05:06.271
like, extremely sterile.

05:06.273 --> 05:09.107
So, Carol is marrying Todd?
Yeah, 'cause they...

05:09.109 --> 05:11.243
they're gonna have sex, so that
means they have to get married.

05:11.245 --> 05:12.678
She's very old-fashioned
in that way.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.980
You know what,
I kind of love her for that.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.582
Yeah, me too. Yeah, I mean,
I've never told her, but...

05:17.584 --> 05:19.184
You've never told her
you loved her?

05:19.186 --> 05:20.585
No.

05:20.587 --> 05:21.787
You got to do that.
You got to get on that.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.455
Yeah, oh, no, no, I will.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.657
I'm just, uh, waiting
for the-the perfect time.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.592
Anyway, so quick divorce,

05:27.594 --> 05:29.194
marriage to Todd,
impregnation,

05:29.196 --> 05:30.662
divorce from Todd,
re-marriage to me, birth.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.130
Yeah, well,

05:32.132 --> 05:33.932
that's-that's really nice
of Todd to do that.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.801
He's a good dude. Yeah.
Yeah.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.103
No, that's a... that's a...
that's a... yeah.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.271
Yeah.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.107
Um, uh, you know,

05:42.109 --> 05:45.310
I-I would've asked you,
but, you know, Carol...

05:45.312 --> 05:46.678
is a little...
Oh, yeah, yeah...

05:46.680 --> 05:48.113
uncomfortable with it.
Understood, yeah.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.548
I-I wanted it to be you.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.016
I did, I did.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.451
You know,
fought pretty hard for it--

05:52.453 --> 05:54.319
really hard,
you know, valiantly--

05:54.321 --> 05:55.987
but, uh, Carol calls
the shizzies.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.122
Yeah.
The shots.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.824
Hey, say no more.
Yeah.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.058
Uh...

06:00.060 --> 06:01.626
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.
(clears throat)

06:01.628 --> 06:03.395
Yeah, we got a song
to sing here, okay.

06:03.397 --> 06:04.730
So, when's the big...
the big wedding?

06:04.732 --> 06:07.632
Oh, no, I talked to Carol,
and she promised me

06:07.634 --> 06:09.301
it's not gonna be
some big to-do.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.770
("The Wedding March" playing)

06:40.833 --> 06:42.501
(Mike whoops)

06:42.503 --> 06:44.035

She's a handful.

(laughs)

06:47.106 --> 06:49.274

06:49.276 --> 06:51.276
Pretty ugly spot
for a wedding, huh?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.878
(laughs)

06:52.880 --> 06:55.380
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

06:55.382 --> 06:57.382
to join this man and this woman,

06:57.384 --> 07:00.585
however briefly,
in holy matrimony.

07:00.587 --> 07:03.355
Marriage should never
be entered into lightly,

07:03.357 --> 07:06.024
for its sacred bonds
last forever.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.194
Its union... eternal.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.363
Now we come to the part
in the ceremony

07:11.365 --> 07:12.931
where Carol and I will divorce.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.434
Who will be notarizing
the papers?

07:15.436 --> 07:17.636
I will.

07:17.638 --> 07:21.273
I'm a licensed notary.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.909
Okay, so, here...

07:23.911 --> 07:25.310
and here.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.411
TANDY:
All right.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.046
Carol and I are duly divorced.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.648
Uh, would anybody like
to go out on a date?

07:29.650 --> 07:30.649
(laughs)

07:30.651 --> 07:32.284
CAROL:
Too soon.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.318
(laughs)

07:33.320 --> 07:35.253
It's time for the vows.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.254
Carol?

07:36.256 --> 07:38.657
Todd, this is not

07:38.659 --> 07:40.959
my first sexual rodeo,

07:40.961 --> 07:43.261
but still you accepted me
as a pure

07:43.263 --> 07:47.232
and unsullied vessel for
your seed, and because of you,

07:47.234 --> 07:49.835
our child will not be a bastard.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.570
No judgment, Erica.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.472
None taken?

07:53.474 --> 07:55.774
Carol, that was beautiful.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.275
Todd?

07:57.277 --> 07:59.978
I can't believe
we're-we're doing this.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.746
(laughs)

08:01.748 --> 08:03.281
Join the club.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.984
I am so...

08:05.986 --> 08:09.120
honored and blessed
by the opportunity

08:09.122 --> 08:11.756
to make a life
for you and Tandy,

08:11.758 --> 08:14.025
and to do so
in the presence

08:14.027 --> 08:15.994
of my two lovers,

08:15.996 --> 08:19.965
with their full support,
makes it all the more special.

08:19.967 --> 08:23.134
Tandy, you're like
a brother to me, man,

08:23.136 --> 08:25.036
and like a brother,
I'd do anything for you.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.772
It just... it all comes back

08:27.774 --> 08:29.941
to family.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.111
Yeah, uh, thank you, Todd.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.780
Yeah, that was very, uh...

08:35.782 --> 08:36.982
enlightening.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.284
Now I'm obligated to ask

08:39.286 --> 08:42.153
if anyone has an objection
to these two being married,

08:42.155 --> 08:45.023
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.224
Anyone?

08:47.226 --> 08:48.627
Nobody?

08:48.629 --> 08:52.230
Well, if that's the case,
I guess I'll say it.

08:52.232 --> 08:55.500
No friggin' way.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.402
I'm sorry?

09:02.842 --> 09:04.976
What?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.913
I'm so sorry to ruin
this beautiful wedding,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.381
and I love you, Todd.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.683
You are like
a brother to me.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.784
But, Mike...

09:14.186 --> 09:16.421
...you're even more
like a brother,

09:16.423 --> 09:18.523
because you are a brother--

09:18.525 --> 09:21.359
my brother, brother.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.361
What are you saying?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.865
I'm saying, Mike Shelby Miller,

09:26.867 --> 09:29.334
will you be our sperm?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.236
Well, I thought you said
Carol didn't want that.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.237
It wasn't Carol.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.672
It was me.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.106
Plus, I didn't think
you'd want to do this.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.509
Yeah, of course, I'd want to.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.178
Uh, that is,
if Carol is okay with it.

09:40.180 --> 09:43.181
Well, I should probably
check with my fiancé.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.182
Todd?

09:44.184 --> 09:45.917
Dear Lord.

09:45.919 --> 09:46.918
He's fine.
Yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.886
Yeah?
Right?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.354
No, of-- come on, uh, yeah.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.056
Of course. I mean,
y-you know, he's your brother.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.357
I mean, it kind
of makes sense.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.758
So, I-I, you know,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.126
yeah, of course, yeah, please.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.595
I'm not upset.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.063
(laughs)
What do you say, Spaceman?

09:58.065 --> 10:00.632
I-I'd be honored.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.633
(all chuckling)

10:01.635 --> 10:02.934
Todd, could you take a seat?

10:02.936 --> 10:03.935
I'm going, okay?

10:03.937 --> 10:05.203
Okay.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.538
I'm going.
Okay.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.208
Sorry, yeah. Hey, thanks.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.310
Here we go. This is...

10:12.312 --> 10:14.813
Frickin' ridiculous.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.281
Well, switching gears, uh...

10:16.283 --> 10:17.549
Yeah.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.917
Pretty ugly spot
for a wedding, huh?

10:18.919 --> 10:19.884
(laughter)

10:19.886 --> 10:21.653
Okay, I'll be at the bar.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.055
TANDY: Marriage should never
be entered into lightly,

10:24.057 --> 10:26.591
for its sacred bonds
last forever.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.093
GAIL:<i> There you go.</i>
MIKE:<i> All right, here we go.</i>

10:28.095 --> 10:30.061
I can't wait.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.630
Mm-hmm.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.298
It's a raisin ball cake.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.332
Mmm.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.634
Can you taste the mustard?

10:35.636 --> 10:37.736
Sure can, yeah, mmm.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.504
CAROL: It's kind of
a new thing I'm starting...

10:39.506 --> 10:41.072
♪ Say we like to body
rock the parties... ♪

10:41.074 --> 10:42.340

acidity of the raisins.

10:57.824 --> 11:00.258
Why wouldn't I be?
I don't know.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.294
Uh, detecting kind of
an anger in your moves.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.430
Well, you must be reading
my moves wrong.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.432
Okay.

11:07.434 --> 11:08.967
Are we good here?

11:08.969 --> 11:11.169
Absolutely.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.671
'Cause you seem upset.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.706
Why would I be upset?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.342
I don't know. 'Cause you said
you're okay with it.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.778
Well, then I guess
I must be okay with it.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.813

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
If I'm being honest,
Mm-hmm.

11:40.967 --> 11:43.301
I never really knocked moccasins

11:43.303 --> 11:45.370
with someone I don't know
that well.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.372
Yeah, well, why don't we get
to know each other, then?

11:47.374 --> 11:49.174
Okay.
Yeah? Um...

11:49.176 --> 11:50.308
how'd you and Phil meet?

11:50.310 --> 11:52.510
I saw his billboards,
Mm-hmm.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.547
and then I caught him
sniffing my bra,

11:55.549 --> 11:59.250
and I almost shot him,
and then he wet himself.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.319
And we've been together
ever since.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.488
So, just a classic
pee-at-first-sight, huh?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.257
(laughing):
Yeah.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.193
Exactly, yeah.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.195
All right, Carol,

12:10.197 --> 12:12.831
I would have peed like crazy
the first time I saw you, too.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.432
(laughing):
Oh, would you?

12:14.434 --> 12:15.567
Heck, I may have even
squeezed out

12:15.569 --> 12:17.235
a little, teeny, tiny turd.

12:17.237 --> 12:18.570
(both laugh)

12:20.506 --> 12:22.340
CAROL (laughing):
Yeah.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.409
I don't know.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.346
Oh, Tandy, what the hell
have you done?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.181
(laughter continues)

12:30.183 --> 12:31.716
<i>(Carol and Mike laughing)</i>

12:31.718 --> 12:33.585
(laughing):
He's really...

12:33.587 --> 12:34.719
How's that happy couple, huh?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.187
Oh, we're great.
Mm-hmm.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.522
We're just getting
to know each other

12:37.524 --> 12:38.523
even more.
Mm-hmm.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.092
So, today's the big day, huh?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.427
I got you a little gift.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.195
You are such a doll.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.296
You-- oh, wow.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.232
What?
Thanks, Phil.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.100
Wow.
It's for the connubial venture.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.102
You know, uh, some outfits
for the occasion.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.205
Hey, that's a...
that's a nice blue.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.807
Look at that.
Huh.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.075
Uh-oh.
What?

12:57.077 --> 12:59.110
You know, I think they're
fairly self-explanatory,

12:59.112 --> 13:00.712
but in case they're not, uh,

13:00.714 --> 13:02.547
this hole is
for your penis, Mike.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.748
And this is
for your corresponding

13:03.750 --> 13:05.216
sexual area, Carol.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.051
Anyway, when we get
into that sex room,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.720
let's just keep it simple, huh?

13:08.722 --> 13:10.255
This is not the Winter Olympics.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.489
There's no style points.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.724
No hot dogging.

13:12.726 --> 13:14.225
Let's just represent
our country,

13:14.227 --> 13:16.127
get through the race,
get back to the village.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.662
It's just an honor to be there.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.097
Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah?

13:19.099 --> 13:20.732
Yep.
I-I think we know
what we're doing.

13:20.734 --> 13:21.800
Oh, no, no, no, I know.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.502
Uh, we'll figure it out
as we go, yeah.

13:24.504 --> 13:26.271
I'm sorry, "we"?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.405
W-What are you talking about?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.175
Oh, I'm gonna be there.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.281
Here we go.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
Huh?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.117
What do you think?

13:39.119 --> 13:42.253
Here, right here
is the, uh, insemination bed.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.521
Uh, this is my seat.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.590
It's right here
on the 50 yard line.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.959
Although, I might move it down
closer to field goal range

13:47.961 --> 13:50.595
once we get going, you know,
depending on what's...

13:50.597 --> 13:52.497
you know, where the action's at
and such.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.032
Uh, we'll deal...
that'll be a game-time decision.

13:54.034 --> 13:55.500
Anyway, uh,

13:55.502 --> 13:59.304
why don't we take our positions
and, uh, you know, make a baby.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.973
Phil, I got to say, I-I'm
not totally comfortable

14:01.975 --> 14:03.541
with this arrangement.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.810
Well, you know, this is
the arrangement we got, so, uh,

14:05.812 --> 14:08.613
if you don't like it,
there's the friggin' beads.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.782
Okay.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.218
All right, well,
uh, sorry, Carol,

14:13.220 --> 14:14.452
I just...
It's okay, Mike.

14:14.454 --> 14:15.787
Yeah.
(Mike chuckles)

14:17.156 --> 14:19.624
Uh, Mike, Mike.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.993
Wait, w-wait a minute.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.127
Hear me out.

14:23.129 --> 14:25.330
Look, there actually
is a very serious reason

14:25.332 --> 14:26.464
I need to be here.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.999
I'm listening.

14:28.001 --> 14:31.202
I want to get a real close-up
of that genitalia of yours.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.171
JK, this is a bad time
for a joke.

14:33.173 --> 14:34.572
But seriously,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.408
have you ever seen the movie
<i>Indecent Proposal?</i>

14:37.410 --> 14:39.210
Yes, of course.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.512
I just think that
if Woody Harrelson

14:41.514 --> 14:43.314
had been in that room,

14:43.316 --> 14:45.516
Demi Moore would have never
stayed with Robert Redford,

14:45.518 --> 14:48.052
and I will go to my grave
with that opinion.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.021
But Demi Moore ends up
going back

14:50.023 --> 14:51.656
to Woody Harrelson
at the end of the movie.

14:51.658 --> 14:52.657
Yeah, but...

14:52.659 --> 14:54.025
(sighs)

14:54.027 --> 14:57.262
Look, just do
what you need to do.

15:03.602 --> 15:06.838
Please don't look
at my genitals.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.074
You know I can't make
that promise, Mike.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.877
I cannot believe
I'm gonna do this, okay.

15:12.879 --> 15:13.912
You're gonna do it!

15:13.914 --> 15:15.680
(laughs) He's gonna do it.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.181
He's back in.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.716
(whispers): Okay.
All right.

15:18.718 --> 15:19.784
Thanks, Mike.

15:19.786 --> 15:20.852
Hey, yeah, no.

15:20.854 --> 15:22.353
Let's get into
positions, huh?

15:22.355 --> 15:25.223
Those, uh, robes off.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.492
Oh, yeah.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.803
First here.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.907
(clears throat)

15:42.909 --> 15:45.143
Hi.
Hi.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.311
Please...

15:46.313 --> 15:47.412
(Carol chuckles)

15:47.414 --> 15:49.647
...begin.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.283
CAROL:
<i>Okay, Mike.</i>

15:52.285 --> 15:54.552
Yeah.
Let's get this
picnic started, huh?

15:54.554 --> 15:56.487
Why don't you lay out
the gingham blanket.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.222
I'm sorry, what?

15:58.224 --> 15:59.590
You're on a friggin'
picnic, Mike!

15:59.592 --> 16:01.759
God, it's like he's never
had sex before.

16:01.761 --> 16:05.797
Okay, I-I guess I'm opening up
the picnic basket?

16:05.799 --> 16:07.165
Yes, Mike.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.499
Mm-hmm.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.634
Very good.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.935
What did you bring?

16:10.937 --> 16:14.605
Uh, uh... potato salad.

16:14.607 --> 16:18.109
No, 'cause you know I have
a bad po-tah-to allergy.
Okay.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.244
Got a frickin' po-tah-to
allergy, dude.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.279
Okay, all right,
fine, okay...

16:21.281 --> 16:22.413
uh, coleslaw?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.481
Yes!
Okay.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.817
Mike, you brought coleslaw!

16:25.819 --> 16:29.454
But it's high 70s out,
so we got to eat it fast.

16:29.456 --> 16:30.655
Enough with the friggin'
side dishes, Carol.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.756
Get to the main course.

16:33.592 --> 16:36.594
Well, I'm pretty hungry
for some fried chicken.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.364
Okay, all right, well, let me,
uh, let me grab you some

16:39.366 --> 16:40.698
fried chicken...

16:40.700 --> 16:41.766
N-n-n-no,
watch that hand.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.167
Ow, ow, ow!

16:43.169 --> 16:44.302
Okay, all right, what...

16:44.304 --> 16:46.137
I'm not allowed to touch her?

16:46.139 --> 16:47.472
Only with your penis.

16:47.474 --> 16:48.806
Okay, fine.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.141
All right, um, I'm sorry,
where were we?

16:50.143 --> 16:51.609
Oh, fried chicken.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.311
Fried chicken, fried chicken.
Okay, fried chicken.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.880
Uh-oh, oh, no, Carol.
Oh!

16:55.882 --> 16:58.149
I just knocked over
the baked beans.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.784
No, you did not!

16:59.786 --> 17:01.452
(muttering):
Oh, my God.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.287
You know I love my baked beans.

17:03.289 --> 17:06.724
CAROL: Now we got to clean
them all up with our mouths.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.327
They're really invested
in this picnic theme.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.329
Would you like
some iced tea, Mike?

17:11.331 --> 17:13.164
MIKE:
Ooh, that sounds good.

17:13.166 --> 17:16.167
I don't know that I like
living here anymore.

17:16.169 --> 17:18.302
Oh, yes, this picnic is so good!

17:18.304 --> 17:19.837
I'm starting to see some ants.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.172
Oh, I-I-I see them, too.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.573
They're heading
right towards us.

17:22.575 --> 17:23.808
They are on the blanket!

17:23.810 --> 17:24.976
Carol...
Oh, God.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.477
They're on the watermelon,

17:26.479 --> 17:27.678
and they're climbing up
onto the coleslaw.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.081
Oh, there's so many ants!
Carol!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.315
Oh, the ants are
all over this picnic.
Carol...

17:31.317 --> 17:32.383
Oh, no...

17:32.385 --> 17:33.418
Carol, Carol!
...so many ants.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.852
Carol, Carol, look at me!
Oh, oh, no!

17:34.854 --> 17:36.187
They are gonna ruin
the coleslaw!

17:36.189 --> 17:37.722
Carol, I love you!

17:39.491 --> 17:41.759
I love you, Carol.

17:41.761 --> 17:45.563
I love you, too, Tandy.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.665
You're gonna do this now?!

17:47.667 --> 17:49.000
Oh, come-- no, please.

17:49.002 --> 17:50.501
Please, please,
please stop.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.502
Guys...

17:51.504 --> 17:53.071
Okay, guys, picnic's canceled.

17:56.608 --> 17:57.775
TANDY:
I love you, too.

17:57.777 --> 17:58.943
I-I don't really care...
right now.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.084
So, how was
the picnic last night?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.953
Well, it was a very...
was a very crowded park,

18:08.955 --> 18:12.356
and we had a pretty serious
looky-loo situation as well.

18:12.358 --> 18:14.725
Yeah, and Mike's impotent,
so that's kind of a bummer.

18:14.727 --> 18:15.726
(chuckles)

18:15.728 --> 18:17.628
Yeah, Phil,
I'm not impotent.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.064
Mike, I was there.
I saw it, okay?

18:20.066 --> 18:21.899
Or rather, didn't see it.
Wink, wink.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.234
(laughs)

18:23.236 --> 18:24.535
No, it's fine, no judgments.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.570
Wink, wink.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.572
(laughs)
Phil, having another

18:27.574 --> 18:28.873
person yell, "I love you,"

18:28.875 --> 18:29.941
to the person
you're having sex with

18:29.943 --> 18:31.542
is kind of a buzz kill.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.877
Agree to disagree.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.812
Uh, but, yeah, as he said, uh,

18:34.814 --> 18:36.948
I finally did declare
my love for Carol,

18:36.950 --> 18:38.983
and it was, uh,
quite well-received.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.251
What, you hadn't
done that before?

18:40.253 --> 18:41.586
Melissa, you know me,

18:41.588 --> 18:43.421
I'm kind of
a perfect moment guy.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.789
(Todd clears throat)

18:44.791 --> 18:47.558
Morning, everybody.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.995
Todd, made a little, uh,
change there, I see.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.598
Uh, yeah, I did.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.234
Why? Was I supposed
to ask permission?

18:56.236 --> 18:57.802
Of course not, no.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.604
Yeah, 'cause I'm free to do
what I want, when I want.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.771
I don't have
to answer to anybody,

19:00.773 --> 19:02.140
except for Gail and Melissa.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.008
Damn right.
Yeah.

19:04.010 --> 19:06.244
Bud, I'm sensing a
little hostility here.

19:06.246 --> 19:08.513
Uh, what do you say we
go out and take a little

19:08.515 --> 19:10.815
tandem Jet Ski ride
and talk it out?

19:10.817 --> 19:12.850
Yeah, I'm afraid
I'm a little booked up today.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.685
Why don't you ask Mike?

19:17.356 --> 19:20.825
Well, I have a date
with a friend from Bordeaux.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.661
MELISSA: Gail,
it's a little early for wine.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.103
Hi, Gail.

19:32.105 --> 19:33.804
Bye, Gail.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.174
Good morning.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.809
Hey, I'm ovulating, so we should
probably get to it, Mike.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.478
Tandy, you want to get
your grabber stick?

19:40.480 --> 19:42.446
Yeah.
Uh, Carol, give me that.

19:42.448 --> 19:43.681
Okay.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.349
You took
this test just now?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.051
Yeah, it's still got pee on it,

19:47.053 --> 19:49.120
so you might not want to hold it
over your cereal.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.823
Carol, this isn't
an ovulation test.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.526
This is a pregnancy test.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.662
Oh, gosh, they look the same.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.130
Let me get
an ovulation test.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.366
No.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.534
Carol.

20:04.903 --> 20:07.438
You're pregnant.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.576
I'm pregnant?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.578
(shouts)

20:13.580 --> 20:15.213
I'm pregnant!
(squeals)

20:15.215 --> 20:17.315
(laughter)

20:17.317 --> 20:19.083
Yay!

20:19.085 --> 20:20.084
Yay!

20:20.086 --> 20:21.085
(shouts)

20:21.087 --> 20:22.553
ERICA:
Congratulations!

20:22.555 --> 20:25.656
Mike, you're not impotent, bud.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.158
Yeah, I know that.

20:27.160 --> 20:28.426
I think you're
missing the point.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.760
That can't be
my baby, anyway.

20:29.762 --> 20:30.895
It has to be your baby.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.063
No, nothing happened
last night.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.232
It's too soon, anyway.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.068
What, so... what are you saying?

20:37.070 --> 20:40.338
Buddy, that baby's yours.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.672
What?
Yeah.

20:43.942 --> 20:46.010
I did it.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.178
Sure did.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.613
I did it!

20:48.615 --> 20:50.748
(laughs)

20:52.417 --> 20:53.818
Congratulations!
