WEBVTT

00:17.849 --> 00:21.386
Class, if you remember
nothing else from this course,

00:21.419 --> 00:23.488
I want you to remember
this one thing.

00:25.056 --> 00:29.228
Dishonesty, lies, cheating...

00:30.928 --> 00:33.599
You will never get
away with them.

00:33.632 --> 00:35.534
They will always come
back to haunt you,

00:35.566 --> 00:37.636
and you will pay the price.

00:39.705 --> 00:40.707
Yes, Mr. Cranston?

00:42.041 --> 00:43.976
This price that
has to be paid,

00:44.008 --> 00:46.779
I was thinking, Professor
Wrightway, like everything else,

00:48.080 --> 00:51.384
shouldn't we ask
if it's worth paying?

00:51.416 --> 00:54.053
I'm not talking about
small-time thievery.

00:54.086 --> 00:55.921
We're business students here.

00:55.953 --> 00:58.757
I'm talking about
something really big,

00:58.791 --> 01:02.294
where you steal or cheat people
out of a lot of money.

02:22.875 --> 02:23.910
Zachery.

02:25.109 --> 02:27.846
I just wanted to say
that last night...

02:28.881 --> 02:29.882
Wonderful.

02:33.751 --> 02:35.453
Veronica.

02:35.487 --> 02:37.089
We're in the office
right now, honey.

02:37.121 --> 02:39.125
I like to keep
things professional.

02:42.627 --> 02:44.564
Aren't you gonna
open it, Zachery?

02:45.231 --> 02:46.666
I'm kind of busy right now.

02:47.899 --> 02:50.635
And, please,
don't call me that.

02:50.668 --> 02:54.005
In here, it's either
"Mr. Cranston" or "Sir".

02:56.742 --> 02:57.844
Okay.

03:07.052 --> 03:08.654
<i>There's no
denying it.</i>

03:09.554 --> 03:10.856
<i>I'm a bastard.</i>

03:12.156 --> 03:14.793
<i>But let's go back
before I had success,</i>

03:14.827 --> 03:16.829
<i>and fame, and money.</i>

03:19.931 --> 03:23.135
<i>It all began with
just my mother and me,</i>

03:23.167 --> 03:25.804
<i>and her candy store,
of course.</i>

03:30.075 --> 03:33.745
<i>Then, she met the man who would
change our lives forever...</i>

03:35.047 --> 03:36.948
<i>Mr. Edwin Murk,</i>

03:36.982 --> 03:39.785
<i>the big investment manager.</i>

03:39.817 --> 03:42.087
The most important
thing in life

03:42.119 --> 03:45.991
is to understand the difference
between good and bad.

03:48.827 --> 03:49.895
Good.

03:52.064 --> 03:53.099
Bad.

03:58.603 --> 03:59.704
Good.

03:59.738 --> 04:02.508
Yes, son.
Well done, well played.

04:03.007 --> 04:04.677
Now, Zachery,

04:04.709 --> 04:09.147
this is a symbol of all
the beautiful things

04:09.180 --> 04:10.982
that are gonna happen
in your life.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.723
<i>I'd always known
Mr. Murk had another life.</i>

04:18.656 --> 04:19.991
<i>And I was curious.</i>

04:30.736 --> 04:34.139
<i>I knew then that one day
I would be like Mr. Murk.</i>

04:35.774 --> 04:38.043
<i>Lies, cheating,</i>

04:38.075 --> 04:40.712
you will never
get away with it.

04:40.745 --> 04:43.082
They will always come
back to haunt you...

04:43.115 --> 04:45.684
<i>So, after graduation,</i>

04:45.716 --> 04:48.721
<i>I spent seven years
at Mr. Murk's investment firm,</i>

04:48.753 --> 04:52.957
<i>working my way up
to senior portfolio manager.</i>

04:52.990 --> 04:55.894
<i>Things were good. Very good.</i>

04:55.928 --> 04:57.163
<i>Or so I thought.</i>

05:03.735 --> 05:05.871
Even though your husband
is gone, Mrs. Finnegan,

05:05.904 --> 05:07.005
you can count on me.

05:08.940 --> 05:11.243
I can continue to manage
your money for you.

05:13.878 --> 05:15.580
I need to keep this short.

05:15.613 --> 05:16.548
Suffice it to say,

05:16.582 --> 05:18.851
it is time to strike out
in a new direction.

05:18.884 --> 05:20.686
Leave the firm, son.
The sooner, the better.

05:20.719 --> 05:23.187
You too, Mabel,
take your business elsewhere.

05:23.221 --> 05:24.623
What's going on, sir?

05:24.656 --> 05:26.858
Some nonsense about fraud.

05:26.892 --> 05:28.861
Embezzlement,
money laundering.

05:28.894 --> 05:30.228
Bribery, tax evasion.

05:30.262 --> 05:32.665
Mr. Murk, wait...
I don't understand.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.267
There must be some mistake.

05:51.283 --> 05:55.220
<i>With Murk Wealth
Management on my resume,</i>

05:55.252 --> 05:58.858
<i>other employers shunned me
like a bad disease.</i>

06:01.993 --> 06:05.297
<i>So, I decided to start
my own business.</i>

06:20.144 --> 06:21.714
<i>A wise choice?</i>

06:24.015 --> 06:25.817
<i>I'll tell you what happened...</i>

06:27.284 --> 06:28.921
<i>And you decide.</i>

06:33.024 --> 06:36.262
Hedge fund?
That sounds exciting.

06:37.896 --> 06:40.132
What do you think, Gerald?

06:40.164 --> 06:44.068
I still consult my husband
on matters of importance.

06:44.101 --> 06:45.837
You'd be my first client.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.377
Well, Gerald says no.

06:51.409 --> 06:53.344
No hedge fund.

06:53.377 --> 06:55.880
Sorry, dear, he doesn't
want to take any risks.

06:57.082 --> 07:00.118
He can be a bit
of an old woman.

07:00.151 --> 07:01.820
I've already committed
my client's money

07:01.853 --> 07:03.355
to another fund
management company.

07:03.387 --> 07:06.691
How many Masters tournaments
did I take you to? What, five?

07:06.724 --> 07:10.128
That many?
Well, thanks again, by the way.

07:10.161 --> 07:12.864
Experience of a lifetime.
Never forget it.

07:12.897 --> 07:15.200
Won't be the same
going without you.

07:15.233 --> 07:16.300
You're going this year?

07:16.334 --> 07:20.105
As luck would have it,
another company invited me.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.007
That wouldn't, by chance,
be the same company

07:22.039 --> 07:24.308
you committed your client's
money to now, would it?

07:24.341 --> 07:28.113
You know, I... I believe it is.

07:29.281 --> 07:31.150
You ready for this? All right.

07:34.185 --> 07:35.787
Ah, yes!

07:35.820 --> 07:37.321
Game time. Whoo!

07:41.425 --> 07:44.096
So you're starting
up a new hedge fund.

07:44.128 --> 07:46.898
Yes. Always wanted
my own business.

07:46.932 --> 07:49.802
You know, no boss,
no partners to answer to.

07:49.834 --> 07:53.272
And that means I can cut you
a damn good break on fees.

07:53.305 --> 07:54.906
Forget about it, Cranston.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.409
I've already transferred
my account over to Amanda.

07:57.442 --> 08:00.079
She's got me hooked up
on one of those hot, new issues.

08:02.781 --> 08:04.450
Congrats on
the new gig, Amanda.

08:04.483 --> 08:05.451
That didn't take long.

08:05.483 --> 08:08.252
Dryesdale Ferrit's been after me
for a long time.

08:08.286 --> 08:09.855
I bet.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.856
And hey, what about your news?

08:11.889 --> 08:14.425
I hear you're starting
your own firm.

08:14.459 --> 08:18.297
Yeah. To tell you the truth,
it's been difficult.

08:20.264 --> 08:23.736
Hard to find clients when
you don't have a track record,

08:23.769 --> 08:26.172
and it's difficult to get
a track record without clients.

08:28.373 --> 08:30.041
I don't suppose
you have any leads

08:30.075 --> 08:32.111
or a bone or two
to throw at me.

08:39.350 --> 08:41.119
"Magnus Hardcastle?"

08:42.253 --> 08:44.222
He's super wealthy.

08:44.256 --> 08:46.459
But my firm refused
to take him on.

08:47.559 --> 08:49.328
Why? What's wrong with him?

08:57.201 --> 09:01.105
I didn't make the fortune
that I have today

09:01.138 --> 09:03.743
worrying about ethics.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.945
If there's one thing
that I've learned, Cranston,

09:07.978 --> 09:10.916
it's the value of shit.

09:10.949 --> 09:12.151
"Shit," sir?

09:13.417 --> 09:16.121
Stuff nobody wants
or wants to do.

09:17.088 --> 09:19.190
It's made me a wealthy man.

09:19.224 --> 09:21.259
Foreclosures,
wasn't it, Mr. Hardcastle?

09:21.292 --> 09:23.262
That's right.

09:23.295 --> 09:28.065
Bankers today,
bunch of gutless wimps.

09:28.099 --> 09:30.469
They need people like me

09:30.502 --> 09:33.137
to take care of all
the messy stuff for 'em.

09:33.171 --> 09:35.440
But you moved on.
Sold your business.

09:35.473 --> 09:36.641
That's right.

09:36.674 --> 09:42.247
And the last thing I want
is to leave my money in a bank.

09:42.280 --> 09:46.185
I didn't make the kind
of fortune that I have today

09:46.218 --> 09:48.521
trusting those fat-ass bankers.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.893
Well, sir, that's why I'm here.

09:55.926 --> 09:57.461
I'd like to manage
your fortune.

09:57.494 --> 10:01.299
I want a real son of a bitch
handling my loot,

10:01.333 --> 10:04.203
note some wine-sippin'
number cruncher.

10:04.235 --> 10:06.304
You don't have to worry
about that, sir.

10:06.338 --> 10:10.041
I'm prepared to get
my hands very, very dirty.

10:10.075 --> 10:12.477
In fact, I'm starting
a new hedge fund

10:12.509 --> 10:13.578
that will focus
on the kind of business

10:13.612 --> 10:15.214
I think that you'll like.

10:15.247 --> 10:18.883
Weapons, gambling,
pornography, pollution.

10:18.916 --> 10:21.485
Now you're talking my language.

10:22.988 --> 10:24.223
Excuse me, sir.

10:24.256 --> 10:27.025
I think you'll find this
more to your liking.

10:27.057 --> 10:28.526
Why, what's wrong
with this bottle?

10:28.560 --> 10:29.627
It's poisoned, sir.

10:29.661 --> 10:31.229
You bastard!

10:31.262 --> 10:33.297
I'm going to make you pay.

10:34.232 --> 10:36.334
She claims you
foreclosed on her mother.

10:37.302 --> 10:40.205
I foreclosed on lots
of people's mother.

10:42.107 --> 10:44.309
Take it from me, son.

10:44.342 --> 10:48.413
There's no surer sign
of a great business

10:48.445 --> 10:50.983
than having people
try to kill you.

10:52.249 --> 10:54.018
I'll tell you what.

10:54.051 --> 10:56.321
I like the sound
of this new fund of yours.

10:58.189 --> 11:00.925
I'll set you up
with a million bucks.

11:00.959 --> 11:02.127
Mmm?

11:04.662 --> 11:07.265
<i>With my first
client finally on board,</i>

11:07.299 --> 11:10.369
<i>all I needed to do
was make some good investments.</i>

11:10.401 --> 11:13.238
The other investors
were put off by the mosquitoes.

11:13.271 --> 11:14.506
Well, that or the snakes.

11:14.539 --> 11:16.141
Made a major
financial commitment

11:16.174 --> 11:17.542
to this venture, you know.

11:18.575 --> 11:21.647
Ah, excuse me.
I, um... I have to take this.

11:37.329 --> 11:39.531
It seems there's
been a development.

11:39.564 --> 11:41.233
Oh, yeah?

11:41.266 --> 11:44.402
The gold in
our mine samples, um,

11:44.435 --> 11:46.604
apparently it didn't all come
from the mine.

11:48.672 --> 11:49.573
So...

11:49.608 --> 11:52.678
No, it, uh,
it came from wrist watches.

11:54.546 --> 11:56.248
All of it, actually.

11:56.281 --> 11:58.183
Ground-up wrist watches.

12:00.185 --> 12:01.987
So, what are you saying?

12:03.021 --> 12:04.189
All things considered,

12:04.222 --> 12:05.991
it's probably best
if I get out here.

12:09.460 --> 12:11.129
Hey!

12:14.431 --> 12:16.467
We need to talk about
this Internet firearms company

12:16.501 --> 12:18.036
you recommended.

12:18.069 --> 12:19.103
You assured me

12:19.137 --> 12:20.604
that the project would be up
and running by now.

12:20.637 --> 12:22.240
Pull.

12:25.609 --> 12:28.079
I need a winner, fast.

12:28.113 --> 12:30.349
Just tell your investor
to be patient.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.651
- Right, Jared?
- Yeah. I mean...

12:32.684 --> 12:34.386
Jared here is the smartest
guy in the industry.

12:34.419 --> 12:36.188
That's why I brought him
here today to meet you.

12:36.220 --> 12:39.156
He's our company's secret sauce.

12:39.190 --> 12:41.693
Quite frankly,
he's what you've invested in.

12:41.725 --> 12:42.626
I mean, I wouldn't...

12:42.661 --> 12:44.161
And when Jared's got
this product ready,

12:44.195 --> 12:46.031
that's when the company
goes public.

12:46.064 --> 12:48.767
I figure a market cap
between one and two billion.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.769
Maybe three, on the upside.

12:52.771 --> 12:54.272
When would that be?

12:54.305 --> 12:55.306
Jared?

13:01.813 --> 13:03.615
<i>The next year continued</i>

13:03.647 --> 13:06.050
<i>with one disaster after another.</i>

13:06.084 --> 13:07.386
Cranston.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.588
I didn't make the kind
of fortune that I have today

13:09.621 --> 13:11.723
by tolerating disappointment.

13:11.756 --> 13:14.760
And your fund is
disappointing me.

13:14.792 --> 13:17.128
No need to worry. I'm sure
it'll get better real soon.

13:17.161 --> 13:22.434
My dentist made 20%
by investing in bull semen.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.536
Have you ever considered
that, by the way?

13:24.569 --> 13:25.637
Bull semen?

13:25.670 --> 13:27.372
Uh, no, I can't say that...

13:27.405 --> 13:28.573
And my golf pro?

13:28.605 --> 13:31.108
He made a killing
in vintage guitars.

13:33.411 --> 13:35.347
Don't worry.
Glass is bulletproof.

13:39.217 --> 13:42.521
Unless things pick up
in the next quarter,

13:42.554 --> 13:45.524
I'm afraid I may have
to consider my options.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.428
You sure you'll be happier
in bull semen, sir?

13:54.265 --> 13:56.401
<i>My circumstances were bleak.</i>

13:56.434 --> 13:58.804
<i>And my misfortunes?</i>

13:58.836 --> 14:01.205
<i>They were not limited
to my business.</i>

14:02.373 --> 14:04.642
You gotta find
someone else with money.

14:04.675 --> 14:07.079
I've never asked
anyone for help.

14:07.112 --> 14:09.548
Do you know how long my store
has been a client of your bank?

14:09.580 --> 14:11.248
Thirty-four years.

14:11.281 --> 14:12.684
What about
that son of yours?

14:12.717 --> 14:14.186
The one with
the hedge fund?

14:27.498 --> 14:28.433
<i>I'm not sure
how much longer</i>

14:28.467 --> 14:30.602
<i>I'm gonna be
able to stay in business.</i>

14:30.634 --> 14:32.670
Back when I worked
for you, Mr. Murk,

14:32.704 --> 14:34.339
we had a research department,

14:34.372 --> 14:38.376
and my investment performance
was strong.

14:38.408 --> 14:41.312
But now, not so much.

14:42.881 --> 14:44.882
In my experience,
you need something

14:44.916 --> 14:47.453
the other ambitious
young types don't have.

14:48.619 --> 14:49.654
An edge.

14:50.421 --> 14:51.589
What could that be?

14:55.727 --> 14:57.362
<i>You'll figure it out.</i>

15:13.545 --> 15:15.579
<i>We're business students here.</i>

15:15.613 --> 15:18.349
Talking about
something really big,

15:18.382 --> 15:21.586
where you steal or cheat
people out of a lot of money.

15:23.787 --> 15:25.422
Two words, sir.

15:25.455 --> 15:27.425
Charles Ponzi.

15:27.458 --> 15:28.860
Thank you,
Mr. Tempest.

15:28.892 --> 15:31.897
As usual, your preparation
for this course is exemplary.

15:33.797 --> 15:35.200
Thank you.

15:35.233 --> 15:36.601
Charles Ponzi

15:36.633 --> 15:39.570
instigated one of the most
famous financial frauds

15:39.603 --> 15:40.571
in history.

15:40.604 --> 15:43.374
And, sure, he lived
a high life for a time,

15:43.407 --> 15:45.442
profiting at his
clients' expense.

15:45.475 --> 15:48.279
It must have seemed great
having the big house,

15:48.313 --> 15:50.615
the swimming pool,
the air conditioning.

15:50.647 --> 15:53.817
But ultimately,
what happened to him?

15:53.850 --> 15:55.153
He was arrested.

15:55.686 --> 15:56.921
He went to jail.

15:56.954 --> 15:58.589
Led away
in handcuffs,

15:58.623 --> 16:00.959
he was disgraced and ruined.

16:00.992 --> 16:03.295
Professor Wrightway,
I was wondering.

16:03.328 --> 16:05.230
This was back
in the 1920s, right?

16:05.262 --> 16:06.430
Yes.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.400
Did he really
have air conditioning?

16:17.407 --> 16:20.344
<i>A Ponzi scheme
is a classic fraud.</i>

16:20.377 --> 16:23.214
<i>Its essence is deception.</i>

16:23.248 --> 16:24.715
<i>And the perpetrator
deliberately</i>

16:24.748 --> 16:27.752
<i>overstates the value of assets
held in client accounts,</i>

16:27.785 --> 16:30.255
<i>thereby creating
a false impression</i>

16:30.287 --> 16:31.690
<i>of investment success.</i>

16:43.968 --> 16:46.704
<i>Like all
the best ideas, it was simple.</i>

16:47.805 --> 16:49.641
<i>That's why I knew
it could work.</i>

16:51.541 --> 16:55.513
<i>My first step,
acquire a successful image.</i>

16:57.648 --> 17:00.784
<i>And, of course,
I need a team,</i>

17:00.818 --> 17:03.255
<i>one I could trust.</i>

17:03.287 --> 17:05.324
Do you have any idea
what you're talking about?

17:06.891 --> 17:08.727
They say peanut butter is good.

17:10.327 --> 17:11.997
But when it comes
to catching vermin,

17:13.597 --> 17:15.665
I'm a traditionalist.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.401
This could mean jail.

17:17.434 --> 17:21.472
I mean, like a very, very
long time in jail. I mean...

17:21.506 --> 17:23.842
I mean, maybe the rest
of our lives.

17:23.874 --> 17:26.411
Wilfred, we've known
each other a long time.

17:26.443 --> 17:28.378
We've been friends
since we were kids,

17:28.412 --> 17:30.649
and you were a star back
in Professor Wrightway's class.

17:30.681 --> 17:33.584
But now, you've been
out of work.

17:33.617 --> 17:34.685
For over a year.

17:34.719 --> 17:36.854
You said it yourself,
you're running out of money.

17:36.888 --> 17:40.992
I know times have been a little
tough recently, but this...

17:41.025 --> 17:43.828
I spent six years in compliance
at a major brokerage firm,

17:43.861 --> 17:46.965
then three years in enforcement
at the commission.

17:46.998 --> 17:50.302
I've dedicated my entire career
to upholding the law.

17:50.334 --> 17:51.603
And what you're proposing...

17:51.635 --> 17:53.872
What I'm proposing
is the perfect application

17:53.904 --> 17:55.773
of your skills.

17:55.806 --> 17:58.043
Sit down.
Come on, have a seat.

17:58.075 --> 17:59.777
Now think about it.

17:59.811 --> 18:01.046
Your entire life so far

18:01.078 --> 18:02.846
has been nothing less
than the ideal training

18:02.880 --> 18:03.882
for this venture.

18:04.449 --> 18:06.084
Besides,

18:06.116 --> 18:07.518
how else are you gonna pay

18:07.552 --> 18:09.488
for those medications
your wife needs?

18:12.723 --> 18:14.725
You know about that?

18:14.758 --> 18:18.462
I also know what bandits
those drug companies can be.

18:18.496 --> 18:20.332
It's just so hard.

18:20.364 --> 18:22.433
Trying to do
a proper job search,

18:24.067 --> 18:26.970
let alone an interview
when I just

18:27.004 --> 18:30.809
keep bursting
into tears.

18:32.376 --> 18:33.677
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.547
Look at me. I'm a mess.

18:36.581 --> 18:39.051
Nobody's gonna hire me.

18:39.650 --> 18:40.884
All right.

18:40.918 --> 18:41.920
Listen.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.788
Here's the way I figure it.

18:44.822 --> 18:47.559
With your expertise
and my salesmanship,

18:47.592 --> 18:50.527
we could create the greatest
and most glorious scheme

18:50.561 --> 18:51.863
in the history of scheming.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.130
It'd take them years.

18:53.163 --> 18:54.699
Years and years
to catch up to us.

18:54.731 --> 18:57.635
In the meantime, think what
you could do for Sarah.

18:58.402 --> 19:01.873
Wilfred, you could
save her life.

19:05.843 --> 19:07.978
Why would anyone fire
an excellent accountant

19:08.011 --> 19:09.447
like Martin Abacus?

19:10.547 --> 19:13.084
In business school,
you were a legend.

19:13.116 --> 19:14.853
They said I drank too much.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.756
Sorry.

19:17.788 --> 19:20.691
Don't be. I see it
as an opportunity.

19:20.725 --> 19:24.429
And opportunity to go out
on my own, to work for myself.

19:24.461 --> 19:28.065
Independence, freedom,
all that bollocks.

19:29.667 --> 19:32.971
But there's one small problem.

19:35.038 --> 19:37.142
It's taking a little longer
than I'd like

19:37.174 --> 19:38.943
to find my first client.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.847
Actually, as fate would have it,

19:42.880 --> 19:46.484
I'm looking for a new
auditor for my hedge fund.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.585
- Is that so?
- Yes.

19:48.619 --> 19:52.891
You see, I find that most
accountants are so literal,

19:53.490 --> 19:56.460
so lacking in imagination.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.430
Well, my family said

19:58.462 --> 20:00.699
that I should always
have been an artist.

20:02.132 --> 20:04.469
I would like
my fund's financials

20:04.501 --> 20:07.873
to be more than a mere mundane
reporting of actual fact.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.876
My first degree
was in literature.

20:11.909 --> 20:15.914
My favorite genre was fantasy.

20:15.947 --> 20:17.482
Fantasy.

20:22.586 --> 20:23.921
Veronica.

20:23.955 --> 20:26.591
So good to see you.

20:26.623 --> 20:28.427
How much do you know
about hedge funds?

20:29.626 --> 20:31.195
Not very much, sir.

20:31.228 --> 20:33.198
That's excellent.
You can start right away.

20:34.565 --> 20:35.967
Oh.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.469
Yes.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.005
I think you're gonna
work out very well.

20:46.710 --> 20:47.912
Nice touch.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.189
<i>No one can know
or suspect what we're doing.</i>

20:58.221 --> 21:00.525
<i>Not even your assistant,
Veronica.</i>

21:00.557 --> 21:03.094
All right, listen up.

21:03.126 --> 21:08.665
This is what your
clients want, correct?

21:08.699 --> 21:12.103
And this is what you've been
getting for them, correct?

21:13.904 --> 21:16.773
Okay, so, here's the key.

21:16.806 --> 21:18.943
This part, right here.

21:20.978 --> 21:23.948
We need a structure
that raises no alarms.

21:23.980 --> 21:26.584
It starts with the folks
holding the fund's assets.

21:26.616 --> 21:28.752
Right now, you've got what,
a single prime broker

21:28.786 --> 21:30.622
with custody
of everything, correct?

21:30.654 --> 21:31.922
We need to fix that.

21:31.956 --> 21:34.926
No one can ever see
the whole picture.

21:34.959 --> 21:38.662
We need multiple prime brokers,
each holding only a small piece.

21:38.696 --> 21:40.899
Then, we need
an investment strategy,

21:40.931 --> 21:43.668
something that
nobody understands.

21:43.700 --> 21:47.005
I recommend derivatives,
options, futures, swaps.

21:47.037 --> 21:48.539
Know anything about them?

21:51.308 --> 21:52.776
They're complicated.

21:52.809 --> 21:55.113
Exactly. That's why
they're perfect.

21:55.145 --> 21:59.883
And... Trades.

21:59.917 --> 22:02.654
Lots and lots of trades.

22:02.687 --> 22:05.823
I want to see pages
and pages of them.

22:05.855 --> 22:08.325
We should have so many
damn transactions

22:08.359 --> 22:10.228
that anyone nosy enough
to investigate

22:10.260 --> 22:12.763
will be buried under
an avalanche of detail.

22:12.796 --> 22:16.834
Brilliant!

22:16.866 --> 22:18.769
<i>Wilfred was
doing great work.</i>

22:20.071 --> 22:23.007
<i>Now it was time to win back
my old client.</i>

22:25.910 --> 22:28.046
Cranston, what are you
doing here?

22:28.078 --> 22:30.315
Oh, forgive me
for interrupting, Jasper.

22:30.347 --> 22:32.783
I was hoping we might
get in a few holes together.

22:32.816 --> 22:35.319
Well, as you could see,
I'm already committed.

22:35.353 --> 22:37.322
Oh, this isn't purely social.

22:37.354 --> 22:40.223
Dick here is the president
of Forthright Funds.

22:40.257 --> 22:42.294
His firm's handling
my client's money now.

22:43.193 --> 22:45.829
Heard a lot about
your firm, Mr. "Urine."

22:45.863 --> 22:47.164
Uren, actually.

22:47.198 --> 22:49.132
I'm surprised
to see you out here.

22:49.165 --> 22:51.168
If my results
were anything like yours,

22:51.201 --> 22:53.103
I'm not so sure I'd be out here
working on my golf swing.

22:53.136 --> 22:54.137
You little prick.

22:54.171 --> 22:56.239
I hate to say it,
Dick, but he's right.

22:56.273 --> 22:57.875
Your results are crap.

22:57.908 --> 22:59.911
Come on, Jasper, I know things
haven't worked out

22:59.943 --> 23:01.878
since you came on board,
but over time,

23:01.911 --> 23:05.248
my firm's record after adding
back fees and adjusting for risk

23:05.282 --> 23:07.218
and relative
to our peer universe,

23:07.250 --> 23:08.418
it's solid. Pretty solid.

23:08.451 --> 23:11.088
How's that compared to the 20%
per year I've been making?

23:11.122 --> 23:14.392
Hoo-hoo, 20% is
a hell of a nice number, Dick.

23:14.424 --> 23:15.659
Okay, numbers aren't everything.

23:15.692 --> 23:16.794
True.

23:16.827 --> 23:19.296
That's why I prepared a little
package for you, Jasper.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.365
How's it sound?

23:20.398 --> 23:23.368
Private jet to Augusta,
tickets to the Masters,

23:23.401 --> 23:24.669
two hostesses,

23:24.702 --> 23:28.172
and an invitation to the E-Z-GO
Golf Park cocktail reception.

23:29.172 --> 23:30.909
You can get into that?

23:31.609 --> 23:33.845
We've got work
to do, Martin.

23:33.878 --> 23:36.114
Anything to do with investments,

23:36.913 --> 23:38.749
no one can see it.

23:39.749 --> 23:42.753
Except Internet firearms,

23:42.786 --> 23:44.822
bankrupt gold mine.

23:44.854 --> 23:46.857
This stuff is perfect.

23:46.891 --> 23:48.892
Perfect to keep
Veronica occupied.

23:52.363 --> 23:55.799
You son of a bitch, Cranston!

23:55.833 --> 23:58.902
Back fees,
adjusting for risk. It's solid!

23:58.936 --> 24:00.005
It's solid!

24:08.411 --> 24:10.681
Dear investor, good news.

24:10.715 --> 24:13.151
I am happy to report
an exceptional increase

24:13.183 --> 24:15.987
in the value of your holdings
in the Cranston Fund.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.855
The key to these strong results?

24:18.889 --> 24:21.159
Complex derivatives strategies

24:21.191 --> 24:23.995
such as the double
diagonal spread,

24:24.027 --> 24:25.697
the roller coaster swap,

24:25.729 --> 24:27.397
the reverse iron albatross,

24:27.430 --> 24:31.036
and, of course,
the swaption collar.

24:34.104 --> 24:35.806
So beautiful,

24:37.240 --> 24:39.777
and so utterly untrue.

24:41.946 --> 24:45.983
I represent one of the most
discreet private banks

24:46.016 --> 24:48.085
in Switzerland, Mr. Cranston,

24:48.119 --> 24:51.089
and your fund
has come to our attention.

24:51.122 --> 24:53.458
I'm delighted to hear that,
Fraulein Stumpf.

24:53.490 --> 24:56.460
Its performance
is remarkable.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.362
Well, thank you.

24:58.394 --> 25:00.198
One does one's best, huh?

25:03.299 --> 25:06.738
And my client here,
Mr. Karamazov,

25:06.770 --> 25:09.139
is interested
in making an investment.

25:11.241 --> 25:13.810
Never heard of
Mr. Karamazov before.

25:13.844 --> 25:14.978
Should I?

25:15.011 --> 25:19.783
He owns the largest chain
of funeral parlors in Siberia.

25:20.918 --> 25:25.790
But he's looking to diversify.

25:25.823 --> 25:28.226
We really
miss you here at the Commission.

25:28.258 --> 25:31.496
Resources are stretched
so thin, it's crazy.

25:31.528 --> 25:34.766
I don't know how they expect us
to catch the next fraud artist.

25:38.469 --> 25:39.938
My new job.

25:41.205 --> 25:44.275
Sometimes I wish
I had a new job.

25:44.307 --> 25:47.077
"Cranston Fund Management.

25:48.379 --> 25:51.182
"Chief compliance officer."

25:51.215 --> 25:52.350
Well, now that you're there,

25:52.382 --> 25:55.353
that's one fund manager
we won't have to worry about.

25:56.053 --> 25:57.889
- Huh?
- Please.

26:13.571 --> 26:19.276
Mr. Karamazov is tired
of clipping the coupons

26:19.309 --> 26:20.978
and government bonds.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.120
<i>He wonders
if you would be willing</i>

26:29.152 --> 26:33.791
to accept an initial investment
of $5 million.

26:36.861 --> 26:38.296
<i>A Ponzi scheme</i>

26:38.328 --> 26:41.164
<i>can only survive as long
as it pays off any investors</i>

26:41.198 --> 26:43.066
<i>who request their money back.</i>

26:43.100 --> 26:44.368
<i>And for this reason,</i>

26:44.401 --> 26:47.971
<i>a well-run scheme will always
aim to ensure sufficient inflows</i>

26:48.005 --> 26:51.008
<i>of new money
to cover any outflows.</i>

26:58.915 --> 27:00.450
The keys to the city,

27:00.484 --> 27:03.921
as mayor, is the highest
honor that I can grant.

27:03.953 --> 27:06.089
We need more citizens like you.

27:06.123 --> 27:08.226
Citizens who support
vital projects.

27:08.258 --> 27:09.594
Project that are essential

27:09.626 --> 27:12.062
to the well-being
of our community.

27:12.095 --> 27:14.164
Projects like your
re-election campaign?

27:17.101 --> 27:19.003
Now let's get a photo.

27:19.036 --> 27:21.072
I don't hand this
shit out every day.

27:22.672 --> 27:25.409
- An honorary doctorate of law.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:25.441 --> 27:27.277
Well, it's the least we can do

27:27.311 --> 27:30.548
for one of our most
distinguished graduates.

27:30.581 --> 27:32.984
Welcome, Dr. Cranston.

27:34.450 --> 27:36.653
<i>My fabricated
investment returns</i>

27:36.687 --> 27:38.923
<i>proved an irresistible hook.</i>

27:38.956 --> 27:40.458
<i>And within six years,</i>

27:40.490 --> 27:43.427
<i>the whole world was paying
attention to my firm.</i>

28:15.726 --> 28:17.194
I'm with Zachery Cranston,

28:17.227 --> 28:18.461
one of the world's
top-performing

28:18.495 --> 28:19.930
hedge fund managers.

28:19.963 --> 28:22.532
His fund was up 20% last year.

28:22.565 --> 28:25.502
Mr. Cranston, what are your
views on the stock market?

28:26.236 --> 28:27.571
Thanks, Melanie.

28:27.603 --> 28:29.440
Short-term, we're range-bound.

28:29.472 --> 28:31.075
But let me be clear.

28:31.107 --> 28:32.609
This is a cyclical bull market

28:32.642 --> 28:35.278
within a longer term
secular bear market.

28:35.312 --> 28:37.982
If, however,
the Dow and the S&P

28:38.015 --> 28:41.118
breach their 180-day
moving averages,

28:41.151 --> 28:43.086
we could see
a possible breakout,

28:43.120 --> 28:47.959
either to the upside
or maybe the downside.

28:47.991 --> 28:50.994
But aren't you concerned with
the head and shoulders pattern

28:51.027 --> 28:52.462
that's been forming
in the markets lately?

28:52.496 --> 28:55.599
Very concerned, Melanie.
Very concerned.

28:55.632 --> 28:59.070
Always pay attention to those
head and shoulders patterns.

29:05.776 --> 29:09.046
You are
amazing, my boy.

29:09.078 --> 29:12.649
You have made me
a pisspot-full.

29:12.682 --> 29:14.451
And you can take it from me.

29:14.485 --> 29:17.588
A man can never have
too many pisspots.

29:17.621 --> 29:19.757
It's been another
strong quarter, sir.

29:19.789 --> 29:22.026
I have to admit.

29:22.058 --> 29:24.761
Some of the investments
in your portfolio,

29:24.795 --> 29:26.630
I'm not sure I agree with.

29:26.662 --> 29:30.034
There's a pajama
company in there,

29:30.066 --> 29:33.503
and some kind of
teddy bear operation.

29:33.536 --> 29:37.274
Now, I didn't make the kind
of fortune I have today

29:37.306 --> 29:41.112
by investing in pajama
companies and teddy bears.

29:41.144 --> 29:43.413
Well, that's the new world
of investing, sir.

29:43.447 --> 29:46.316
I don't know.
It's still a long way from

29:46.350 --> 29:48.686
the guns and drugs and...

29:48.719 --> 29:51.055
...ammo stocks that we...

29:51.087 --> 29:53.790
That we talked about at first.

29:53.824 --> 29:57.061
And what's wrong with
good old-fashioned businesses

29:57.094 --> 30:02.165
with names like Rentokil
and Black Ops Holdings?

30:02.199 --> 30:05.335
That's how real men
make their money,

30:05.369 --> 30:09.540
not with some company called
Cuddlegram or Fleecy Bedtime.

30:10.807 --> 30:13.443
You have to ask yourself, sir.

30:13.477 --> 30:16.313
Are those real men
making 20% per year?

30:16.345 --> 30:18.681
Hell no.

30:18.715 --> 30:21.084
I'll send you some more
money in the morning.

30:23.187 --> 30:24.755
Veronica.

30:24.787 --> 30:26.356
You mind joining me
for a moment?

30:31.828 --> 30:34.598
I want to share something
very special with you.

30:41.438 --> 30:43.574
Now, close your eyes.

30:49.546 --> 30:51.248
No peeking.

30:59.856 --> 31:01.558
Okay, you can open your eyes.

31:05.595 --> 31:07.230
I don't know what to say.

31:08.798 --> 31:10.767
Well, go ahead. Open it.

31:26.682 --> 31:29.219
Wonderful, isn't it?

31:29.819 --> 31:31.421
Grab a hammer.

31:31.455 --> 31:33.191
We'll hang it up
in the reception.

31:33.923 --> 31:35.558
Come on.

31:35.592 --> 31:37.128
Get your champagne.

31:44.267 --> 31:46.136
Bravo.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.538
Bravo, Investment Superman.

31:48.572 --> 31:50.674
I'm so happy for you.

31:50.707 --> 31:52.343
Thank you, sir.

31:54.644 --> 31:57.314
Nice to see that you
haven't lost your touch

31:57.346 --> 31:59.116
with the old marts.

32:00.717 --> 32:03.320
May I ask about
your legal case?

32:03.353 --> 32:06.457
Of course. You need to know.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.757
Truth is, Zachery,

32:07.792 --> 32:11.696
I've suffered a little setback
on the old jurisprudence front.

32:12.796 --> 32:14.565
What kind of setback?

32:14.597 --> 32:16.366
Tomorrow, I'll be convicted.

32:17.567 --> 32:20.336
But, hey, you know me.

32:20.370 --> 32:22.440
No need to worry
about all of that.

32:23.306 --> 32:25.175
Goddamn lawyers

32:25.209 --> 32:27.710
with their
sanctimonious bullshit!

32:27.744 --> 32:29.881
You'll never beat me!

32:32.915 --> 32:34.551
But you're gonna appeal, right?

32:34.584 --> 32:36.687
Zachery...

32:36.719 --> 32:39.289
Do you remember when I tried
to teach you the difference

32:39.323 --> 32:40.892
between good and bad?

32:45.661 --> 32:50.367
Well, I want you to have this.

32:55.439 --> 32:56.673
A Bible?

32:56.707 --> 33:00.210
I know, there's a lot
of crazy stuff in there,

33:00.244 --> 33:04.749
but the point is, in life,
that's what counts as good.

33:06.850 --> 33:08.486
And this baby,

33:09.686 --> 33:12.456
well, this little thing,
it turns out...

33:12.488 --> 33:13.723
It's good, too.

33:13.757 --> 33:15.292
No, Zachery.

33:15.325 --> 33:16.893
But I'll tell you what.

33:19.462 --> 33:20.797
It's beautiful.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.370
Now, you'll have
to excuse us.

33:27.871 --> 33:29.806
So little time.

33:34.311 --> 33:35.513
Bye, sweetie.

33:36.747 --> 33:37.848
Bye, Ma.

33:40.816 --> 33:42.652
Do you want me
to be there for you, sir,

33:42.686 --> 33:43.721
in court?

33:44.854 --> 33:46.890
I want to be there
by your side.

33:46.922 --> 33:49.292
Thank you, but there's no need.

33:50.294 --> 33:51.796
It's all taken care of.

35:06.602 --> 35:08.538
<i>The doctor said
she had known for months</i>

35:08.571 --> 35:09.939
<i>her time was limited.</i>

35:14.578 --> 35:17.715
<i>Of course, they had a medical
name for her condition,</i>

35:17.747 --> 35:21.384
<i>but personally, I think
she died of a broken heart.</i>

35:33.997 --> 35:36.033
It's very kind of you
to invite me out here

35:36.065 --> 35:37.701
to your country estate.

35:37.734 --> 35:39.670
I really do appreciate it.

35:39.703 --> 35:40.838
Nonsense.

35:40.870 --> 35:42.372
It's the least I can do.

35:42.406 --> 35:44.642
You're a very important part
of my team, Martin.

35:50.013 --> 35:51.815
And that's why I'm sorry to hear

35:51.848 --> 35:53.884
that you had some reservations
about the work we're doing.

35:55.785 --> 35:59.556
The addiction program I've been
attending has got me thinking.

36:00.524 --> 36:01.692
Zachery...

36:05.995 --> 36:09.465
I realize now the terrible
mistakes I've made.

36:09.498 --> 36:12.136
That seems harsh.

36:12.169 --> 36:16.140
You know, those rehab people,
they can be very judgmental.

36:16.172 --> 36:18.609
And also very insightful.

36:18.642 --> 36:20.977
You see, they've
helped me understand

36:21.011 --> 36:25.783
for the first time
the importance of honesty.

36:26.882 --> 36:29.453
Being honest to yourself...

36:31.922 --> 36:33.857
...is the foundation
of everything.

36:33.890 --> 36:36.960
Well, that I agree with.

36:36.993 --> 36:40.931
And being honest with other
people, that's important, too.

36:42.531 --> 36:43.734
Interesting.

36:46.069 --> 36:49.440
You see, I've come to believe
that people are truly more happy

36:49.473 --> 36:50.940
with a pleasant fantasy.

36:52.042 --> 36:54.478
Maybe for a time,
but in the long...

36:54.511 --> 36:56.113
In the long run, Martin.

37:04.754 --> 37:06.489
Enough of this idle chit-chat.

37:07.156 --> 37:09.091
Let's go stretch our legs.

37:09.125 --> 37:10.795
I'd love to show you
around the property.

38:25.067 --> 38:27.270
About the fund, Zachery.

38:33.143 --> 38:35.279
I've been looking
at the numbers.

38:40.584 --> 38:43.120
Maybe you should talk
to the authorities.

38:45.721 --> 38:47.957
Martin...

38:47.991 --> 38:50.794
I really wish you hadn't
gone to that detox program.

39:35.404 --> 39:39.008
<i>What shall it profit
you to gain the whole world</i>

39:39.042 --> 39:40.978
<i>if you lose your soul?</i>

39:47.049 --> 39:49.385
<i>Pay the price.</i>

39:49.419 --> 39:51.221
<i>Pay the price.</i>

39:52.055 --> 39:54.625
Pay the price.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.326
<i>Pay the price.</i>

40:13.843 --> 40:16.379
I was just thinking of my old
business ethics teacher,

40:16.413 --> 40:17.748
Professor Wrightway.

40:18.281 --> 40:20.317
Earnest Ernie.

40:20.350 --> 40:23.386
"Dishonesty, lies, cheating,

40:23.419 --> 40:25.822
"you'll never get
away with them."

40:28.323 --> 40:30.092
So he's... Is he still teaching?

40:30.125 --> 40:33.363
We put him out
to grass long ago.

40:33.395 --> 40:35.832
He's terribly old-fashioned.

40:35.864 --> 40:38.301
So who's teaching
business ethics now?

40:38.334 --> 40:42.038
That distinction falls to me.

40:42.071 --> 40:44.940
And I take it you don't
agree with Professor Wrightway?

40:44.973 --> 40:46.742
About always paying the price.

40:46.776 --> 40:49.745
Today's world is so dynamic,

40:49.779 --> 40:51.381
so sophisticated.

40:51.413 --> 40:53.383
Who knows what's right,
what's wrong anymore?

40:54.116 --> 40:56.085
Lines are blurred.

40:56.118 --> 40:59.823
Judgment is a matter
of perspective.

40:59.855 --> 41:02.124
So you're saying
that people can cheat,

41:02.158 --> 41:03.661
and they can get away with it?

41:09.031 --> 41:10.033
"Cheat"!

41:11.801 --> 41:13.870
It could be any number
of reasons he's missing.

41:13.902 --> 41:16.906
Martin's an alcoholic,
for God's sake.

41:16.939 --> 41:19.208
I just can't help
feeling somehow responsible.

41:19.241 --> 41:20.910
I...

41:20.944 --> 41:22.279
I know it's crazy, but...

41:22.312 --> 41:24.815
You should
not think like that.

41:24.848 --> 41:28.919
You know, it's not gonna
make him suddenly turn up.

41:30.386 --> 41:31.755
I suppose you're right.

41:31.788 --> 41:33.824
Of course, she's right.

41:33.857 --> 41:36.927
I'm sure they'll
find him eventually.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.296
And in the meantime,

41:40.330 --> 41:43.467
we need to move on
with our lives.

41:43.500 --> 41:47.438
So just try to focus
on something else.

41:48.504 --> 41:50.306
Something positive.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.410
Yes, I suppose
Martin would want that.

41:56.145 --> 41:58.114
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

41:58.147 --> 41:59.816
Thank you for that advice.

42:01.350 --> 42:03.953
You know what would really
boost my spirits?

42:03.986 --> 42:05.521
What?

42:05.555 --> 42:08.158
A philanthropic work.

42:08.190 --> 42:10.459
I really think it will
provide a spiritual refuge

42:10.493 --> 42:12.161
during these dark times.

42:13.196 --> 42:14.498
So maybe you could
set something up

42:14.531 --> 42:15.998
with that doctor
at the hospital.

42:19.067 --> 42:21.370
Yeah!

42:28.343 --> 42:30.813
Dr. Helen.

42:30.846 --> 42:33.082
Thank you for this tour.
Means a lot to me.

42:33.116 --> 42:35.418
- Of course.
- No, I really mean it.

42:35.451 --> 42:38.421
You see, in my work,
I have to do things,

42:38.453 --> 42:41.323
sometimes unpleasant things.

42:41.357 --> 42:43.826
But when I'm here with you,

42:43.859 --> 42:48.131
it makes me think what I do,
maybe it's worthwhile after all.

42:49.464 --> 42:52.935
You know, all important work
has its unsavory side.

42:52.968 --> 42:54.570
Even ours.

42:54.603 --> 42:56.540
Some things that happen
at this hospital

42:56.573 --> 42:58.808
can be very unpleasant.

43:01.844 --> 43:05.915
In recognition
of your outstanding generosity

43:05.948 --> 43:08.984
to the development
of the Cranston Heart Center,

43:09.018 --> 43:10.187
we thank you.

43:16.426 --> 43:20.462
The only reward I require
is the knowledge

43:20.495 --> 43:24.600
that with my donation,
I've added to human happiness.

43:24.634 --> 43:28.905
So I accept
this beautiful tribute

43:28.937 --> 43:31.207
on behalf of the people
in the trenches.

43:32.308 --> 43:35.846
The doctors and all those nurses

43:35.879 --> 43:39.982
who make it possible for me
to save so many lives.

43:54.364 --> 43:56.266
Here. Take this.

43:56.299 --> 44:01.304
Doctor, I just want you
to know that your hospital

44:01.337 --> 44:04.007
can rely on my
continued support.

44:04.040 --> 44:07.477
If there's anything
at all you need...

44:07.509 --> 44:10.379
As a matter of fact,
we're in desperate need

44:10.413 --> 44:13.049
of these life-saving devices.

44:13.082 --> 44:16.620
The company that makes them
is running low on funds,

44:16.652 --> 44:19.589
and they're looking
for an angel investor.

44:20.489 --> 44:22.225
An angel, huh?

44:22.257 --> 44:24.493
Well, you've come
to the right person.

44:29.431 --> 44:32.401
My brother-in-law
spoke very highly of you,

44:32.435 --> 44:34.203
Mr. Tucci.

44:34.236 --> 44:37.606
He said that you can be
relied upon to be discreet.

44:37.640 --> 44:41.511
You see, our auditor
is not available anymore.

44:41.544 --> 44:43.246
And we need someone
to take over

44:43.279 --> 44:45.547
to certify our
financial statements.

44:45.580 --> 44:47.683
Is that something
you'd be willing to consider?

44:47.716 --> 44:49.485
What's to consider?

44:49.518 --> 44:52.221
You know, I never saw
such gorgeous numbers.

44:52.689 --> 44:53.690
Listen to me.

44:53.723 --> 44:57.227
Your fucking statements
should be in a museum.

45:08.971 --> 45:10.406
Where are the statements?

45:10.839 --> 45:12.276
It's right here.

45:13.408 --> 45:14.477
Oh.

45:16.511 --> 45:17.613
Yeah.

45:19.181 --> 45:20.517
Let me get my pen here.

45:28.424 --> 45:32.161
Did I ever tell you how much
I love these statements?

45:45.274 --> 45:46.410
I can't accept this.

45:55.350 --> 45:56.419
Sir.

46:00.556 --> 46:02.092
Thank you.

46:02.125 --> 46:03.493
It's a very generous donation.

46:08.531 --> 46:10.533
I've gotta hand it
to you, Zachery.

46:10.565 --> 46:13.337
This venture of yours
has turned out okay so far.

46:14.803 --> 46:17.073
Thanks to you, my wife...

46:17.774 --> 46:19.676
She's actually walking again.

46:41.696 --> 46:43.132
Mr. Cranston?

46:47.669 --> 46:49.738
Beautiful property
you got here.

46:49.772 --> 46:53.410
I always feel there's something
spiritual about these woods.

46:53.442 --> 46:56.446
Mr. Cranston, we got a guy
who places you and Mr. Abacus

46:56.478 --> 46:58.480
up here together
the day he went poof.

46:58.513 --> 47:00.816
I told you.
I invited Martin for lunch.

47:00.850 --> 47:03.252
Well, this witness,
the guy who saw you,

47:03.285 --> 47:05.187
says he saw you walk
through a field together

47:05.221 --> 47:07.489
and disappear
into these here woods.

47:07.522 --> 47:09.758
My neighbor, birdwatcher.

47:09.792 --> 47:11.161
That's your source?

47:12.495 --> 47:15.232
We also got a report
of gunshots just after.

47:17.866 --> 47:19.602
The only thing worse
than birdwatchers

47:19.634 --> 47:21.138
are the damn hunters.

47:22.772 --> 47:26.476
Property is posted with signs
all over the place,

47:26.509 --> 47:28.612
but it's impossible
to get rid of them.

47:30.712 --> 47:31.714
This witness,

47:31.747 --> 47:34.483
he also says that sometime
after the gunshots,

47:34.517 --> 47:36.185
he saw you walk home alone.

47:38.421 --> 47:41.123
Lieutenant Drake, what exactly
are you looking for?

47:43.225 --> 47:44.626
Somebody's been digging here.

47:44.660 --> 47:46.362
That's right.

47:46.395 --> 47:48.832
Got one of those
metal detectors.

47:48.864 --> 47:50.165
I found quite a few pieces

47:50.198 --> 47:51.734
of old farm equipment
around the place.

47:53.402 --> 47:55.572
Now, why don't I walk
you to your car?

47:55.605 --> 47:57.373
No, no, no. That's all right.

47:57.406 --> 47:58.674
I remember where I left it.

47:59.241 --> 48:00.544
Thanks for your time.

48:06.149 --> 48:07.382
Mr. Cranston,

48:07.415 --> 48:10.219
we have some concerns
about your operation.

48:10.252 --> 48:12.855
Oh, really?

48:12.888 --> 48:16.692
To be blunt, we are finding it
difficult to accept

48:16.725 --> 48:18.861
the accuracy of these returns

48:18.895 --> 48:22.766
based on the investment
strategies you have outlined.

48:23.866 --> 48:25.902
I'm sure we can sort
these things out.

48:25.935 --> 48:30.407
We want to see what I believe
is called the nitty gritty.

48:31.573 --> 48:34.510
We want to see
what is lurking here,

48:34.544 --> 48:36.212
under the surface.

48:45.187 --> 48:46.655
Mr. Cranston.

48:46.689 --> 48:47.824
Veronica, can't you see
that I'm tied up?

48:47.857 --> 48:49.259
There's a gentleman
here to see you.

48:49.292 --> 48:50.759
Exercise a little
judgment, please.

48:50.792 --> 48:51.861
He's gonna have to come back.

48:51.893 --> 48:53.662
Sir, the man outside,

48:53.696 --> 48:56.533
he's a senior enforcement
officer from the regulator.

49:05.841 --> 49:07.343
Mr. Cranston.

49:07.375 --> 49:08.810
My name is Higgins.

49:08.843 --> 49:11.613
I'm responsible
for ensuring compliance

49:11.647 --> 49:15.285
with our agency's
regulatory requirements.

49:15.317 --> 49:17.886
This isn't actually
the best time, Mr. Higgins.

49:17.919 --> 49:19.855
I won't beat
about the bush.

49:19.888 --> 49:22.357
We have an issue
with your fund.

49:22.390 --> 49:23.526
Really?

49:24.593 --> 49:27.262
What might that be?

49:27.296 --> 49:31.301
Your fund is in breach
of our regulations.

49:31.600 --> 49:32.935
Ah.

49:32.968 --> 49:35.537
Surely, there's a mistake.

49:35.571 --> 49:38.507
No, there's no mistake.

49:39.908 --> 49:41.577
It's your statements.

49:42.578 --> 49:46.315
You auditor, a Mr. Tucci,

49:46.348 --> 49:49.318
he filed them,
and there's a problem.

49:51.654 --> 49:53.456
I don't quite understand.

49:53.489 --> 49:55.559
Mr. Tucci assured me
everything was in order.

49:56.259 --> 49:57.761
I'm afraid not.

49:59.794 --> 50:02.798
I see. Well,
I'll discuss this with him.

50:02.832 --> 50:06.868
Yes. I would do that.

50:06.902 --> 50:09.439
You see, Mr. Cranston,

50:09.471 --> 50:14.343
we penalize companies
$200 a day for filing late.

50:15.578 --> 50:19.748
And your statements were
filed three days late.

50:21.651 --> 50:22.685
That's it?

50:24.020 --> 50:26.723
That's the problem?

50:26.756 --> 50:29.926
I wanted to inform you
of this personally.

50:29.959 --> 50:33.328
You see, Mr. Cranston, well...

50:33.361 --> 50:37.700
My mother was at the cardiac
center at the hospital,

50:37.732 --> 50:39.468
and I wanted to let you know

50:39.502 --> 50:42.372
how grateful I am
for what you do,

50:42.404 --> 50:45.874
for all the money that you give
to help people like my mother

50:45.908 --> 50:48.277
receive the treatment
that they need.

50:50.446 --> 50:53.616
I just wish I could waive
that darn fine.

50:54.549 --> 50:55.986
Don't worry about it.

50:56.919 --> 51:00.789
It can't be helped.
Our filing was late.

51:00.823 --> 51:02.792
I just hope that
your mother is okay.

51:04.893 --> 51:08.732
Our parents are so
important, you know.

51:25.448 --> 51:27.951
Nice of you to rejoin us,
Mr. Cranston.

51:33.022 --> 51:37.060
These records,
they're very extensive.

51:37.093 --> 51:39.094
Well, we run a tight ship here.

51:39.127 --> 51:42.832
Let me be clear.
All this paperwork,

51:42.864 --> 51:45.968
it might be convincing
to some people,

51:46.000 --> 51:48.671
but I'm not
easily deceived.

51:48.703 --> 51:51.507
And so I remain concerned.

51:53.808 --> 51:54.877
And I must ask you.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.716
This auditor of yours,
who is he?

52:02.151 --> 52:03.518
Mr. Tucci.

52:03.551 --> 52:06.555
Yeah, I can see
that is his name.

52:06.589 --> 52:08.458
But I have never heard of him.

52:09.692 --> 52:13.663
I think I would like
to meet this Mr. Tucci.

52:23.406 --> 52:24.474
Hey, Cranston,

52:24.506 --> 52:26.608
you got some more of those
beautiful numbers for me?

52:26.642 --> 52:29.411
No, but I have
an interfering Swiss banker

52:29.444 --> 52:31.013
who's about to arrive
any minute.

52:32.047 --> 52:34.016
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, man, come on.

52:34.049 --> 52:36.486
I need you to act
more accountant-like.

52:36.518 --> 52:38.421
Ah, gee, this is exactly why

52:38.453 --> 52:39.721
I didn't join one
of those big firms.

52:39.754 --> 52:41.723
I hate all this jacket

52:41.756 --> 52:43.725
- and tie bullshit.
- Here. Come on, come on.

52:43.759 --> 52:44.827
Okay.

52:44.859 --> 52:46.395
Yeah?

52:46.428 --> 52:47.729
Ah, Mr. Cranston,

52:47.763 --> 52:49.498
I see you made it here
ahead of us.

52:49.531 --> 52:52.033
Yes. I thought I might be
able to answer any questions

52:52.067 --> 52:53.136
you might have.

52:53.169 --> 52:55.805
And this, I take it,
is Mr. Tucci?

52:55.837 --> 52:57.172
Yes.

52:58.808 --> 53:01.677
I won't waste
time, Mr. Tucci.

53:01.710 --> 53:05.548
I have certain reservations
about Mr. Cranston's accounts.

53:05.580 --> 53:09.751
And I'm here to understand how
thoroughly, you, as his auditor,

53:09.785 --> 53:11.053
have reviewed them.

53:11.085 --> 53:14.790
Sure, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
Have a seat, Ms., uh...

53:14.823 --> 53:16.825
Stumpf. Fraulein Stumpf.

53:16.859 --> 53:18.161
Ouch.

53:18.194 --> 53:21.531
It's an unfortunate moniker.

53:21.564 --> 53:25.768
Can't help noticing
that you're working here alone.

53:25.801 --> 53:27.737
I got a gal who comes in
a couple of times a week.

53:29.605 --> 53:31.974
And your premises
are a little,

53:32.006 --> 53:35.677
shall I say, rudimentary.

53:35.710 --> 53:38.147
Well, yeah, I like to keep
the overhead low.

53:38.180 --> 53:41.616
Forgive me for saying this,

53:41.649 --> 53:44.686
but I find myself wondering
why Mr. Cranston

53:44.719 --> 53:46.989
would hire you
to audit his fund.

53:47.589 --> 53:48.658
Oh.

53:49.225 --> 53:51.093
Quite.

53:51.125 --> 53:53.930
You're not one
of the major accounting firms.

53:53.962 --> 53:55.698
You know, personally,

53:55.730 --> 53:59.134
I never understood why anyone
would hire those big firms.

53:59.167 --> 54:00.669
You pay through the nose,

54:00.703 --> 54:02.205
and a bunch of kids
do all the work

54:02.238 --> 54:05.540
while the fat cat partners are
out... They're out playing golf.

54:05.573 --> 54:07.676
With me, what you see
is what you get.

54:07.710 --> 54:09.879
Hmm. Precisely.

54:09.911 --> 54:12.047
And what I see

54:12.080 --> 54:14.216
is not exactly someone

54:14.250 --> 54:16.853
who wrote the textbook
on modern accounting.

54:25.727 --> 54:27.963
Needs a little updating now.

54:27.997 --> 54:30.098
Second biggest seller
in its day, though.

54:45.013 --> 54:49.050
I have to confess.
I am surprised.

54:49.084 --> 54:51.087
This book is something
I would expect

54:51.120 --> 54:52.555
from a Harvard professor.

54:52.922 --> 54:54.223
Fair enough.

54:54.256 --> 54:57.960
This does go back a ways
to my teaching days.

54:59.627 --> 55:01.530
You were an academic?

55:03.265 --> 55:06.736
You don't strike me
as the college type.

55:06.768 --> 55:07.904
I know what you mean.

55:07.937 --> 55:10.672
You know, those places,
they're way too buttoned-down.

55:10.705 --> 55:12.674
- Too many rules.
- Rules, yeah.

55:12.707 --> 55:14.910
That's why I left. Yeah.

55:14.944 --> 55:16.879
You know you can't even bang
the students anymore?

55:16.911 --> 55:18.714
The students?

55:18.747 --> 55:19.848
No, I like it here.

55:19.881 --> 55:21.550
Yeah, no, I make good money.

55:21.584 --> 55:24.252
Yeah, I got a lot
of big accounts, too.

55:24.285 --> 55:27.722
Waste management, pizza chains,
dry cleaners.

55:27.756 --> 55:29.190
There's lots of variety.

55:29.223 --> 55:30.759
That sounds very impressive.

55:30.792 --> 55:34.596
And the best part,
I got freedom, independence.

55:34.629 --> 55:36.631
I can handpick
the people I audit.

55:36.665 --> 55:38.768
People of integrity.

55:38.801 --> 55:41.036
People like Mr. Cranston here.

55:42.004 --> 55:45.575
His financials, impeccable.

55:45.607 --> 55:47.843
Always impeccable.

56:00.689 --> 56:02.825
In Russia, we have saying...

56:10.165 --> 56:11.167
Ooh.

56:12.267 --> 56:14.270
We also have saying...

56:27.683 --> 56:29.852
I don't understand.
What's going on?

56:29.884 --> 56:31.252
You can't seriously
think it's okay...

56:31.285 --> 56:34.122
We got to follow up
every lead, Mr. Cranston.

56:34.156 --> 56:35.358
I found something, Lieutenant.

56:36.959 --> 56:38.127
Let's see it, Ahmed.

56:40.796 --> 56:41.897
Like I said,

56:41.931 --> 56:45.835
there's old bits of farm
machinery all over this place.

56:45.868 --> 56:47.270
Yeah, but this is
what you need to see.

56:49.872 --> 56:51.207
There's no doubt about it.

56:52.207 --> 56:53.710
There's nothing down here.

57:15.830 --> 57:19.234
I just wish we all knew where
poor Martin is, that's all.

57:49.431 --> 57:50.432
<i>I've been assured</i>

57:50.466 --> 57:52.734
<i>that in the absence
of any hard evidence,</i>

57:52.768 --> 57:55.838
the investigation
is going nowhere.

57:55.870 --> 57:59.174
Speaking on behalf of the city,
I couldn't be more embarrassed.

57:59.207 --> 58:01.209
The police were way out of line.

58:01.243 --> 58:03.112
But now that that's behind us,

58:03.145 --> 58:04.747
- I got some happy news.
- Oh.

58:04.779 --> 58:05.781
My two friends here would each

58:05.814 --> 58:08.450
like to put two million bucks
into your fund.

58:09.185 --> 58:11.054
How does that sound?

58:12.821 --> 58:14.924
Waiter, another round.

58:42.451 --> 58:44.987
<i>Pay the price.</i>

58:45.020 --> 58:47.290
<i>Pay the price.</i>

58:53.428 --> 58:56.332
Ms. Patel has
finally gotten through to me.

58:58.033 --> 59:01.270
God knows it took me
long enough.

59:01.303 --> 59:04.406
We are transforming
Mr. Hardcastle's beautiful home

59:04.439 --> 59:06.040
into a new campus

59:06.073 --> 59:08.843
for the Spiritual
Rebirth Institute.

59:08.877 --> 59:11.480
And what exactly
will you be doing here?

59:11.513 --> 59:13.281
The goal is freedom

59:13.314 --> 59:16.351
from material
and physical desires.

59:16.384 --> 59:17.486
If I've learned one thing,

59:17.520 --> 59:22.391
it's that money, things
never brought me happiness.

59:22.424 --> 59:25.060
We plan to build this
special treatment facility

59:25.093 --> 59:27.495
for recovering
financial executives.

59:27.529 --> 59:28.630
Poor souls.

59:28.663 --> 59:32.468
That constant exposure to greed
takes a heavy toll.

59:33.535 --> 59:38.040
Perhaps you yourself have
had some direct experience

59:38.073 --> 59:40.942
with the debilitating effects
of excessive materialism?

59:42.511 --> 59:45.547
This area will be a suite
of meditation rooms.

59:45.580 --> 59:48.283
And next to it,
our pride and joy,

59:48.317 --> 59:52.121
a technologically advanced
aversion therapy facility

59:52.154 --> 59:55.991
complete with the latest
electroshock hardware.

59:56.024 --> 59:59.929
There will even be full-time
counselors to assist our clients

59:59.962 --> 01:00:02.864
in structuring
a charitable giving program

01:00:02.897 --> 01:00:05.401
should they decide
to relieve themselves

01:00:05.433 --> 01:00:08.504
of the burdens of their wealth.

01:00:08.536 --> 01:00:11.573
It's all about giving back
to the community, isn't it, sir?

01:00:11.607 --> 01:00:15.444
I didn't make
the kind of fortune I have today

01:00:15.477 --> 01:00:19.214
without knowing a wise man
when I see one.

01:00:19.247 --> 01:00:23.852
And you are
a wise man, Cranston.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:26.288
Thank you.
That's very kind, sir.

01:00:26.321 --> 01:00:28.156
It was
your heart center.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.458
That's what started me thinking.

01:00:30.491 --> 01:00:33.228
And I finally decided

01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:36.064
I'm not only giving
away my home,

01:00:37.064 --> 01:00:40.435
I'm also giving away my money.

01:00:42.203 --> 01:00:44.406
Our humble institute

01:00:44.439 --> 01:00:49.277
will be honored to receive
his munificent donation.

01:00:49.310 --> 01:00:51.913
So I'll be needing
everything back

01:00:51.946 --> 01:00:53.982
that I've invested with you.

01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:55.852
Everything?

01:00:57.152 --> 01:01:00.189
That's about $20 million.

01:01:00.221 --> 01:01:01.957
That sounds
about right.

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:03.125
Is that a problem?

01:01:13.402 --> 01:01:14.570
<i>A Ponzi scheme</i>

01:01:14.602 --> 01:01:18.072
<i>can only survive as long
as it pays off any investors</i>

01:01:18.105 --> 01:01:20.109
<i>who request their money back.</i>

01:01:20.142 --> 01:01:22.277
How did I ever let you
talk me into this?

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.544
I knew it was mad
from the beginning.

01:01:23.578 --> 01:01:25.547
- Come on, Wilfred, focus.
- How did I ever...

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.283
How much money can
we raise by month-end?

01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:29.618
Not $20 million,
that's for sure.

01:01:29.651 --> 01:01:31.620
Maybe if you hadn't given
so much of it away

01:01:31.652 --> 01:01:33.622
or bought all that stuff.

01:01:33.654 --> 01:01:35.256
I mean, a harpsichord?
Who does that?

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.393
This is hardly the time
to point fingers.

01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:39.362
What I need to know
is what can we do?

01:01:41.096 --> 01:01:43.132
I don't know about you,

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:45.134
but I know what Sarah
and I are doing.

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:47.136
You can't seriously want
to live as a fugitive.

01:01:48.136 --> 01:01:50.038
Would you rather
go to jail, man?

01:01:51.105 --> 01:01:52.607
I'm not gonna do that, either.

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:55.243
Look, we may not have
the money now,

01:01:55.277 --> 01:01:57.313
but we still have
30 days to get it.

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.248
Now, listen.

01:01:59.281 --> 01:02:01.984
We're gonna use those 30 days,
every last one of them.

01:02:02.017 --> 01:02:04.185
And I'm gonna tell you what
I'm gonna be doing. Lying.

01:02:04.218 --> 01:02:06.387
Lying like no one's
ever lied before.

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:08.489
With high returns
and low volatility,

01:02:08.522 --> 01:02:11.492
I've achieved both absolute
and risk-adjusted returns

01:02:11.526 --> 01:02:14.430
that are the envy
of the fund management industry.

01:02:14.462 --> 01:02:17.700
How do I do it?
Well, I follow a simple precept.

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:20.068
Take care of the downside first

01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:22.103
and let the upside
look after itself.

01:02:22.136 --> 01:02:24.038
But there's a catch.

01:02:24.071 --> 01:02:27.276
When the funds get too big,
too successful,

01:02:27.308 --> 01:02:29.178
when they receive
too much money,

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:31.046
well, the returns can suffer.

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:34.750
Veronica.

01:02:34.783 --> 01:02:36.317
Over the next month,

01:02:36.350 --> 01:02:38.553
things could get a little
sticky around here.

01:02:38.587 --> 01:02:39.622
Oh.

01:02:39.654 --> 01:02:42.725
There are
some technical issues, details.

01:02:42.757 --> 01:02:45.194
Things about the way
we've been running the business.

01:02:45.227 --> 01:02:46.428
Paperwork stuff.

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:49.698
Anyway, Wilfred here is gonna
be going through our records

01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:51.632
and making sure everything
is shipshape.

01:02:51.665 --> 01:02:53.602
Just make sure
the shredder is working.

01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:55.770
And that's why it's imperative
that you consider

01:02:55.803 --> 01:02:58.573
increasing your allocation
to the Cranston Fund now

01:02:58.607 --> 01:03:00.275
before the end of this month.

01:03:00.308 --> 01:03:01.409
Because after that,

01:03:01.442 --> 01:03:05.348
I'm afraid I won't be accepting
any new investment.

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.416
I want to say I'm sorry

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:12.254
for how I've been
a little distracted lately.

01:03:12.286 --> 01:03:14.223
But after this little bit
of a thing that we're here in

01:03:14.256 --> 01:03:16.524
gets cleaned up,

01:03:16.558 --> 01:03:20.262
I'm gonna show you just
how much I appreciate you.

01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:24.499
Because, Veronica,
I really do appreciate you.

01:03:25.667 --> 01:03:27.335
We'll have dinner.

01:03:27.835 --> 01:03:29.205
That's a promise.

01:03:34.308 --> 01:03:37.278
Your offer to continue
managing the Hardcastle donation

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:38.748
is most kind.

01:03:39.346 --> 01:03:42.283
But, alas,

01:03:42.317 --> 01:03:44.620
the entire amount
is already committed

01:03:44.652 --> 01:03:47.388
to our institute's expansion.

01:03:47.422 --> 01:03:50.592
So, at the end of the month,

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.094
we will be needing it.

01:03:52.761 --> 01:03:54.230
All of it.

01:03:55.596 --> 01:03:56.698
More tea?

01:03:58.632 --> 01:04:00.468
Come on, what do you say?

01:04:00.502 --> 01:04:03.505
Tax man, Cranston.
I'm afraid he outranks you.

01:04:03.538 --> 01:04:04.806
Oh.

01:04:04.839 --> 01:04:06.107
Yeah!

01:04:06.707 --> 01:04:08.543
Oh, come on.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.483
No can do, Cranston.
No more money.

01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:17.452
I'm leaving the industry.

01:04:17.486 --> 01:04:20.656
Breach of fiduciary duty,
they called it.

01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:26.594
I'll always remember
those Masters tournaments.

01:04:29.364 --> 01:04:31.333
Regrettably, Mr. Cranston,

01:04:31.366 --> 01:04:34.303
my client's occupation
was very high-risk,

01:04:34.335 --> 01:04:37.538
and he's no longer in a position
to make further investments.

01:04:37.571 --> 01:04:38.774
Oh, Fraulein...

01:04:38.806 --> 01:04:41.377
Mr. Karamazov is dead.

01:04:46.714 --> 01:04:47.816
Oh, my...

01:04:53.888 --> 01:04:57.358
Well, yes, of course,
we'd be very interested

01:04:57.392 --> 01:05:00.194
in having you manage some
of our endowment.

01:05:00.227 --> 01:05:01.696
Uh, perhaps you can present

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:04.366
at our next investment
committee meeting.

01:05:04.399 --> 01:05:05.868
When is that?

01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:08.402
Um, three months time.

01:05:08.435 --> 01:05:10.439
Three months?

01:05:10.471 --> 01:05:13.142
Is there any chance you can
make it a little sooner?

01:05:13.174 --> 01:05:15.877
Uh, well, I can speak
to our committee chair.

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:17.845
- Of course.
- Who's that?

01:05:17.879 --> 01:05:19.348
Dick Uren.

01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:20.915
You must know him.

01:05:20.948 --> 01:05:23.784
He's head
of Forthright Funds.

01:05:23.817 --> 01:05:26.522
You may get away
with dishonesty for a while,

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:27.890
but in the end...

01:05:27.922 --> 01:05:31.392
In the end, you will
always pay the price.

01:05:31.426 --> 01:05:32.527
Fucker!

01:05:35.397 --> 01:05:38.366
<i>My performance was solid!</i>

01:05:38.399 --> 01:05:39.667
Dr. Cranston?

01:06:30.352 --> 01:06:31.987
Mrs. Finnegan.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.524
Well, you know, I was Mr. Murk's
secretary for many years.

01:06:35.556 --> 01:06:36.725
Yes, of course.

01:06:36.757 --> 01:06:38.326
And he and I...

01:06:43.364 --> 01:06:45.399
Of course, Gerald never knew,

01:06:45.433 --> 01:06:48.603
but Mr. Murk and I had a bond

01:06:48.636 --> 01:06:51.305
that was nothing like
what he had with your mother.

01:06:51.339 --> 01:06:53.007
He truly loved her.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:55.477
With me, it was just sex.

01:06:57.779 --> 01:06:59.481
Um...

01:06:59.513 --> 01:07:01.349
Tell me about Mammon Trust.

01:07:01.382 --> 01:07:05.654
Mmm. That's a name
I heaven't heard in years.

01:07:05.687 --> 01:07:10.558
Uh, it was a small bank
on one of the channel islands.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:12.426
Saint something or other...

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.562
St. Euripides.

01:07:13.594 --> 01:07:15.464
Yes, that's it.

01:07:15.497 --> 01:07:16.864
There were bank accounts,

01:07:16.897 --> 01:07:19.734
and a safety deposit
box, I believe.

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:21.637
Yes, I'm sure of it.

01:07:21.669 --> 01:07:24.438
Mr. Murk didn't want
any assets traceable to him,

01:07:24.471 --> 01:07:26.908
so everything was in my name.

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:30.011
Everything at Mammon Trust
was for your mother.

01:07:31.812 --> 01:07:32.814
Yeah.

01:07:33.415 --> 01:07:34.983
He really did love her.

01:07:35.015 --> 01:07:36.284
Mmm.

01:07:37.785 --> 01:07:39.587
Yes, now that I think of it,

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.722
you should probably
have it, dear.

01:07:41.756 --> 01:07:44.359
Oh, he was terribly
fond of you, you know.

01:07:45.893 --> 01:07:48.596
I don't suppose you have
any idea what's there.

01:07:48.629 --> 01:07:51.832
None. Though he kept a key
to the deposit box himself.

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:53.602
And as for the cash accounts,

01:07:53.634 --> 01:07:56.937
<i>the statements went
to some lawyer in St. Euripides.</i>

01:07:56.971 --> 01:07:59.341
<i>Uh, what was his name?</i>

01:07:59.373 --> 01:08:02.009
Menlo Sartori at your service.

01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:04.645
Welcome to St. Euripides.

01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:08.416
My car awaits.

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.819
Good of you to pick us up.
I assumed you'd send a driver.

01:08:10.852 --> 01:08:12.421
Oh, good heavens, no.

01:08:12.453 --> 01:08:14.823
I wouldn't dream of entrusting
such important visitors

01:08:14.855 --> 01:08:17.024
to the rustic charms
of our island's taxis.

01:08:17.058 --> 01:08:19.027
I would love to see it.

01:08:19.059 --> 01:08:22.363
Any lawyer can draft
legal documents, Mrs. Finnegan.

01:08:22.397 --> 01:08:24.366
But when it comes
to the loftiest heights

01:08:24.398 --> 01:08:25.966
of client service,

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.903
well, I stand alone.

01:08:27.935 --> 01:08:30.339
- Very nice.
- Even now,

01:08:30.371 --> 01:08:34.375
a bottle of vintage Dom Perignon
awaits at the Sartori residence.

01:08:36.611 --> 01:08:38.580
I think we should get
to the hotel first.

01:08:38.612 --> 01:08:40.448
Of course, of course.

01:08:40.482 --> 01:08:43.986
But I must insist you join me
for Sunday brunch.

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.589
Together,
we shall explore the magic

01:08:47.621 --> 01:08:50.124
of that storied elixir.

01:08:55.662 --> 01:08:57.765
Watch your toes, darling.

01:08:57.799 --> 01:09:00.102
I do hope you have enjoyed
your Sunday brunch

01:09:00.135 --> 01:09:01.403
with us, Mrs. Finnegan.

01:09:01.435 --> 01:09:03.438
Oh, yes, Mr. Sartori.

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:05.805
Menlo. Please call me Menlo.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:07.743
We like to keep things
casual here, don't we?

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:08.644
Yes, yes.

01:09:08.676 --> 01:09:11.545
Though I've never been
fond of "Hector".

01:09:11.578 --> 01:09:15.651
So, on the whole,
I prefer "Police Commissioner".

01:09:16.785 --> 01:09:18.452
If you don't mind.

01:09:18.486 --> 01:09:21.555
The police commissioner
and I go way back.

01:09:21.589 --> 01:09:23.959
Partners in crime,
you might say.

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:26.928
I hope I can repay
your generosity at some point.

01:09:26.961 --> 01:09:30.832
That's my husband.
The soul of generosity.

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.773
- Hilary.
- Mmm?

01:09:37.805 --> 01:09:39.974
Why don't you leave
our guest alone?

01:09:40.006 --> 01:09:42.176
He's trying to enjoy
his afternoon.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:44.578
Perhaps, you should go
have a little nap.

01:09:44.612 --> 01:09:46.148
You're always trying
to get rid of me

01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.948
to shut me up.

01:09:47.982 --> 01:09:50.852
Well, to be fair, dear,
who wants to listen

01:09:50.885 --> 01:09:52.621
to the ravings
of a drunken lunatic?

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:57.526
I hope you rot in hell.

01:10:00.127 --> 01:10:03.031
Well, you must forgive
my lovely wife.

01:10:03.063 --> 01:10:04.765
Well, Mr. Sartori,

01:10:04.799 --> 01:10:07.469
perhaps you should try
being as charming to your wife

01:10:07.501 --> 01:10:08.937
as you are to your clients.

01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:10.972
Food for thought, Mrs. Finnegan.
Food for thought.

01:10:11.005 --> 01:10:16.111
Let's talk about something
more pleasant, hmm?

01:10:16.144 --> 01:10:19.181
For example, what delights
do you think

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:22.617
that safety deposit box
of yours will unveil?

01:10:22.649 --> 01:10:24.553
Well, if those
bank account statements

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:26.455
you showed
are any indication,

01:10:27.188 --> 01:10:28.556
not much.

01:10:30.157 --> 01:10:31.559
Thank you.

01:10:34.261 --> 01:10:36.898
You know, I find it odd

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:39.233
that such pains were taken
setting up those accounts,

01:10:39.267 --> 01:10:42.703
and yet there's hardly
anything in them.

01:10:42.737 --> 01:10:48.109
Well, if I were you, I would
keep my observations to myself.

01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:51.212
This is a delicate time
for us on the island.

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:53.648
The place is swarming
with international police

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:56.585
on one of their
tax haven witch hunts.

01:10:57.184 --> 01:10:58.953
And I know for a fact

01:10:58.987 --> 01:11:02.190
that your arrival
has attracted interest.

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:04.059
Of course,
it goes without saying

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:08.095
that you can rely
on our complete discretion.

01:11:22.076 --> 01:11:26.113
- You have your key?
- Oh, yes. In my bag.

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:34.689
<i>Bonne chance.</i>

01:11:34.721 --> 01:11:37.125
I hope you're enjoying your
visit to St. Euripides.

01:11:37.157 --> 01:11:38.258
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:38.292 --> 01:11:41.295
It's been a very long time,
hasn't it, Mrs. Finnegan?

01:11:41.328 --> 01:11:43.197
- Yes.
- Ah, here we are.

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.906
Now, if you want
to do the honors.

01:11:54.242 --> 01:11:55.610
Bingo!

01:11:55.643 --> 01:11:57.712
I'm sorry.

01:11:57.745 --> 01:11:59.014
I love my job.

01:12:00.314 --> 01:12:03.984
Now, as we like to say
in the banking business,

01:12:04.018 --> 01:12:06.221
have fun. Enjoy.

01:12:23.904 --> 01:12:25.306
Thank you very much,
Mr. Cranston.

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.575
I'll be needing to look

01:12:26.608 --> 01:12:28.544
in the handbag
and the briefcase.

01:12:30.912 --> 01:12:33.181
It's none of your business
what Mrs. Finnegan removed

01:12:33.214 --> 01:12:35.082
from her safety deposit box,

01:12:35.116 --> 01:12:36.216
if anything.

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:39.688
Mr. Cranston, it's not
Mrs. Finnegan I'm interested in.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:41.055
It's you.

01:12:41.089 --> 01:12:44.125
I can connect this island,
that shitty little bank,

01:12:44.157 --> 01:12:46.995
and you to a major
international fraud.

01:12:49.863 --> 01:12:52.132
Fuck! Ugh.

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:53.635
Mrs. Finnegan, easy.

01:12:56.703 --> 01:12:58.706
You're gonna regret that.

01:12:58.739 --> 01:13:01.643
That handbag is now evidence
in an assault.

01:13:01.675 --> 01:13:02.710
Commissioner Angle,

01:13:02.743 --> 01:13:04.011
I insist you take
possession of it.

01:13:11.919 --> 01:13:13.087
It's okay.

01:13:15.389 --> 01:13:16.825
Thank you.

01:13:32.806 --> 01:13:36.344
I'm sorry, Gerald.
The man is a barbarian.

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:39.113
All right, Mr. Cranston.
Your turn.

01:13:39.147 --> 01:13:40.381
The briefcase.

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:43.318
Otherwise, I'll have to place
charges against Mrs. Finnegan.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:46.220
Hell, against you, too,
as an accomplice.

01:13:46.254 --> 01:13:48.023
And neither of you
will be leaving this island

01:13:48.055 --> 01:13:49.223
anytime soon.

01:13:49.256 --> 01:13:51.859
Those allegations
about me you're throwing around,

01:13:51.893 --> 01:13:54.129
there's absolutely
no basis for them.

01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:57.799
I've never been implicated
in any fraud whatsoever.

01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:59.334
Don't play games with me.

01:14:03.804 --> 01:14:05.873
Can you deny knowing this man?

01:14:05.907 --> 01:14:08.710
That's Scraps Bredenkamp,
the mining promoter.

01:14:08.742 --> 01:14:09.710
We have reason to believe

01:14:09.743 --> 01:14:12.112
that somewhere in those
safety deposit boxes

01:14:12.145 --> 01:14:14.948
are stolen assets
he hid from his investors.

01:14:14.982 --> 01:14:17.385
And you, Mr. Cranston,

01:14:17.417 --> 01:14:18.452
you were the last person

01:14:18.486 --> 01:14:20.354
to see him before
he disappeared.

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:23.390
Look, that bastard owes me
a lot of money.

01:14:23.424 --> 01:14:25.460
And I wish you well
in nailing him.

01:14:25.492 --> 01:14:28.362
But I'm not gonna let you
look in my briefcase.

01:14:28.395 --> 01:14:30.165
And my guess is,
you can't make me.

01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:33.068
We'll see about that.

01:14:35.937 --> 01:14:37.939
You're in trouble
now, old boy.

01:14:37.971 --> 01:14:41.142
This new fella they put
in charge is a powerful bugger.

01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:42.410
If you've got nothing to hide,

01:14:42.443 --> 01:14:44.346
I'd open up that briefcase
right now.

01:14:44.879 --> 01:14:47.082
Because, Mr. Cranston,

01:14:47.114 --> 01:14:49.184
once my superior
sets his mind to it,

01:14:49.216 --> 01:14:51.719
he can make your life
a legal nightmare.

01:14:51.752 --> 01:14:52.953
If you're not in jail,

01:14:52.987 --> 01:14:54.989
he'll have you buried
so deep in a swamp

01:14:55.022 --> 01:14:57.358
of international, federal
and state regulations,

01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:00.060
you'll have to get his
permission just to take a crap.

01:15:00.094 --> 01:15:02.898
My advice, don't fuck with him.

01:15:12.939 --> 01:15:16.210
Please accept
my sincere, sincere apologies.

01:15:16.243 --> 01:15:19.147
My subordinate's behavior
was inexcusable.

01:15:19.179 --> 01:15:22.082
Of course, you are beyond
any suspicion.

01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:24.285
Mr. Higgins, so good to see you.

01:15:24.318 --> 01:15:27.522
And I hope you'll give your
mother my very best wishes, hmm?

01:15:27.554 --> 01:15:29.156
Thank you, thank you.

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:30.291
Madam.

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:38.933
Toes, toes.

01:15:38.965 --> 01:15:41.769
Are you sure you won't join me
for a quick lunch

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:45.206
before you head home?
Airline food is so ghastly.

01:15:45.238 --> 01:15:47.541
It was good of you to wait
for us back there, Menlo.

01:15:47.575 --> 01:15:50.077
But if you don't mind,
we'll just head to the airport.

01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:53.348
Oh, dear. How disappointing.

01:15:56.884 --> 01:15:59.354
See, I'd hoped

01:15:59.386 --> 01:16:02.023
that we could settle this
so much more gracefully,

01:16:02.055 --> 01:16:03.924
but instead...

01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:07.795
Mr. Sartori.

01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:09.531
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

01:16:09.563 --> 01:16:13.100
Greed does terrible
things, Mrs. Finnegan,

01:16:13.134 --> 01:16:15.837
even to people like me
who should know better.

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.473
I'm beginning to think you
are not such a very nice man.

01:16:18.505 --> 01:16:20.541
And I hope you shall
find it in your heart one day

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:21.975
to forgive me.

01:16:22.009 --> 01:16:24.145
But until then, for now,

01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:26.046
let's take a peek inside,
shall we?

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:41.429
Goodness.

01:16:42.897 --> 01:16:45.167
You don't see things
like this every day.

01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:55.176
I should have known
from the beginning

01:16:55.209 --> 01:16:56.411
never to trust that man.

01:16:56.443 --> 01:16:58.946
Painful though it is,

01:17:00.447 --> 01:17:02.584
I say we let him have
his fun, Mrs. Finnegan.

01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:06.987
It's a modest price
under the circumstances.

01:17:08.221 --> 01:17:10.224
And I'm pretty sure he won't be
telling anyone about it.

01:17:13.094 --> 01:17:15.430
Well, it's your money, dear.

01:17:16.330 --> 01:17:18.099
But if I ever see him again,

01:17:18.131 --> 01:17:20.000
I'm going to give him
a piece of my mind.

01:17:21.568 --> 01:17:22.937
Shall we?

01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.548
It's a beautiful
day, Veronica.

01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:36.884
It's a beautiful world.

01:17:36.917 --> 01:17:39.286
Hey, I haven't forgotten
that promise.

01:17:39.319 --> 01:17:41.421
Dinner. We're definitely
having dinner.

01:17:41.455 --> 01:17:44.091
Wilfred, do you believe
in divine intervention?

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:46.528
I believe we're screwed,
if that's what you're asking.

01:17:50.130 --> 01:17:51.632
There are more than enough
bearer bonds in there

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:53.268
to satisfy Mr. Hardcastle

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.870
or any other client
that wants out.

01:17:58.038 --> 01:18:00.942
I really think that somebody
must be looking out for us.

01:18:00.974 --> 01:18:03.210
Remarkable. This...

01:18:05.412 --> 01:18:07.047
This is remarkable.

01:18:07.081 --> 01:18:08.950
Uh-huh.
I mean, think about it.

01:18:08.983 --> 01:18:10.418
All of the people we've helped.

01:18:10.451 --> 01:18:13.354
Your wife, the hospital,
the university,

01:18:13.386 --> 01:18:14.989
all of our happy clients.

01:18:16.122 --> 01:18:18.125
It's been a hell
of a journey, Wilfred.

01:18:18.158 --> 01:18:20.461
A hell of a journey.

01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:24.332
I might be a bastard.

01:18:24.364 --> 01:18:27.468
But the man upstairs,

01:18:27.501 --> 01:18:29.370
I don't think
he wants me to stop.

01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:31.239
- Hmm.
- Not yet anyway.

01:18:35.576 --> 01:18:37.478
You just don't see these.

01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:38.979
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

01:18:39.013 --> 01:18:40.614
Gorgeous.

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:46.421
You know what's really funny?

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:48.523
Not many people
would know this,

01:18:48.555 --> 01:18:52.326
these bonds are in denominations
of a million dollars.

01:18:55.295 --> 01:18:58.398
The United States government
never issued

01:18:58.431 --> 01:19:01.969
bearer bonds in denominations
of a million dollars.

01:19:15.582 --> 01:19:18.051
<i>The bonds had been
intended for my mother,</i>

01:19:18.085 --> 01:19:19.554
<i>so I had to believe</i>

01:19:19.586 --> 01:19:21.621
<i>Mr. Murk had thought
they were genuine.</i>

01:19:21.654 --> 01:19:24.425
<i>Fraud, it seemed,</i>

01:19:24.457 --> 01:19:27.362
<i>could ambush even
an old rogue like him.</i>

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:32.634
<i>As for me, I had
just one last play.</i>

01:19:34.068 --> 01:19:36.705
<i>A crazy, desperate gamble.</i>

01:19:40.174 --> 01:19:41.475
Sir.

01:19:42.542 --> 01:19:44.411
Do you remember
you once told me

01:19:44.444 --> 01:19:46.080
you didn't make
the kind of fortune you had

01:19:46.112 --> 01:19:47.648
by worrying about ethics?

01:19:51.551 --> 01:19:52.987
Nice apartment.

01:19:54.121 --> 01:19:56.690
Ethics is a funny thing, son.

01:19:56.724 --> 01:20:02.397
I may have done stuff
that people called unethical,

01:20:02.429 --> 01:20:06.367
stuff that made people
want to kill me.

01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:11.139
But I've always had
one simple rule,

01:20:11.171 --> 01:20:15.676
never, ever break the law.

01:20:18.379 --> 01:20:21.215
Interesting, sir. Helpful.

01:20:21.247 --> 01:20:24.051
The truth is, I haven't
always followed that rule.

01:20:25.019 --> 01:20:27.622
There's no easy way
of saying this, but...

01:20:29.389 --> 01:20:32.559
The results my fund
has been reporting,

01:20:32.593 --> 01:20:34.162
they're completely false.

01:20:35.328 --> 01:20:36.831
That's right.

01:20:36.863 --> 01:20:38.799
I made them up.

01:20:38.832 --> 01:20:41.402
The fund has never
made any profits.

01:20:41.434 --> 01:20:43.237
And what money there was,

01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:46.174
it's almost all gone.

01:20:49.276 --> 01:20:51.179
No. No, thank you.

01:20:55.282 --> 01:20:56.785
Did you hear what I said?

01:20:57.352 --> 01:20:59.220
Your money...

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:04.492
Sir, the money that
you want me to pay you back,

01:21:05.759 --> 01:21:07.062
it's gone.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:11.364
I've always
liked you, Cranston.

01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:14.269
You remind me of me

01:21:15.169 --> 01:21:17.171
back when I was younger.

01:21:17.203 --> 01:21:21.142
And apart from all this
breaking-the-law business.

01:21:22.742 --> 01:21:25.345
So, you're not upset?

01:21:28.648 --> 01:21:29.750
Thank you.

01:21:34.321 --> 01:21:36.424
I miss
my old butler.

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:38.859
Something about a murder charge
back in England.

01:21:38.893 --> 01:21:41.629
I swear I'll pay off every cent

01:21:41.662 --> 01:21:43.831
if you could see your way
to giving me more time.

01:21:43.863 --> 01:21:46.500
I'm sure I can raise new money.

01:21:46.533 --> 01:21:48.702
And the very first dollars
that come in,

01:21:48.736 --> 01:21:50.837
I promise, they'll go right
to you right away.

01:21:50.871 --> 01:21:53.306
You got a set of balls
on you, kid.

01:21:53.340 --> 01:21:54.575
I'll give you that.

01:21:54.608 --> 01:21:56.711
So...

01:21:56.743 --> 01:21:59.479
Does that mean you'll help me?

01:21:59.513 --> 01:22:01.482
That's fantastic.

01:22:01.514 --> 01:22:03.283
I don't know how I can
thank you enough. This is so...

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:05.353
Listen to me, son.
Listen to me.

01:22:05.385 --> 01:22:07.921
If it were up to me.

01:22:07.955 --> 01:22:10.390
But all the proceeds
from my investments,

01:22:10.424 --> 01:22:11.792
the whole 20 odd million,

01:22:11.825 --> 01:22:15.328
it goes to Patel
and the institute.

01:22:15.362 --> 01:22:17.732
So you're really
dealing with her now.

01:22:17.764 --> 01:22:20.334
And that's one tough customer.

01:22:21.468 --> 01:22:23.705
Take it from me, Cranston.

01:22:24.604 --> 01:22:26.140
You're fucked.

01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.409
<i>Everyone has to face
their moment of reckoning</i>

01:23:01.442 --> 01:23:02.777
<i>in their own way.</i>

01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:06.547
<i>Wilfred had chosen his,</i>

01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:10.919
<i>and I... I would choose mine.</i>

01:23:55.729 --> 01:23:58.332
<i>And so, here I am.</i>

01:23:58.364 --> 01:24:00.234
<i>My story almost complete.</i>

01:24:06.005 --> 01:24:08.308
<i>I've written out these musings,</i>

01:24:08.341 --> 01:24:10.711
<i>accounts of my experience
for you to consider.</i>

01:24:11.711 --> 01:24:13.413
<i>Although brief,</i>

01:24:13.447 --> 01:24:16.551
<i>I think of them
as my masterwork.</i>

01:24:21.054 --> 01:24:25.859
<i>Naturally, I'm experiencing
a moment of reflection.</i>

01:24:25.893 --> 01:24:28.696
<i>Well, what do you
think now, Mr. Cranston?</i>

01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:30.798
That idea you had back
in my classroom

01:24:30.831 --> 01:24:32.333
doesn't seem so good, hmm?

01:24:35.035 --> 01:24:37.337
My beautiful
little scheme,

01:24:37.371 --> 01:24:39.674
it's so sad it has to end.

01:24:39.706 --> 01:24:43.076
But you knew from the beginning
it would turn out this way.

01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:46.080
Tell me. Now that you're
facing the consequences,

01:24:46.112 --> 01:24:47.914
I expect you'd go back
if you could

01:24:47.947 --> 01:24:49.849
and undo everything.

01:24:49.882 --> 01:24:52.620
I thought about that, of course.

01:24:52.653 --> 01:24:54.922
People say you can't
buy happiness.

01:24:54.955 --> 01:24:57.725
But, Professor,
the way I figure,

01:24:57.757 --> 01:24:59.794
those people never had
the kind of money I had.

01:25:01.461 --> 01:25:02.696
No.

01:25:02.729 --> 01:25:05.866
Given a second chance,
I'd do it all over again.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.804
But surely you must
have some regrets.

01:25:09.836 --> 01:25:12.572
There was so much more you
could've done with your life.

01:25:13.573 --> 01:25:16.810
True. I do have some regrets.

01:25:16.844 --> 01:25:20.047
Never did take delivery
of my IMAX home theater.

01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:21.849
It's beautiful, isn't it?

01:25:21.881 --> 01:25:24.951
Then there was the gorgeous
doctor at the hospital.

01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:28.022
Oh, man. We could have
been great together.

01:25:29.723 --> 01:25:31.459
Other than that, though...

01:25:32.893 --> 01:25:34.662
That's it?

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:36.831
Those are your only regrets?

01:25:38.698 --> 01:25:39.800
Yeah.

01:25:42.068 --> 01:25:43.705
What about me?

01:25:51.178 --> 01:25:53.381
No. Not really.

01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:14.935
<i>It was Socrates who once said,</i>

01:26:14.968 --> 01:26:18.773
<i>"Death is the greatest
of all human blessings."</i>

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:23.544
<i>I prefer a dry martini.</i>

01:26:25.112 --> 01:26:27.848
<i>And a good cigar, of course.</i>

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:31.485
<i>One of those handmade ones
that last forever.</i>

01:26:34.487 --> 01:26:38.558
<i>But fate has its own plans
for all of us.</i>

01:27:01.982 --> 01:27:03.984
Your client just called to say

01:27:04.017 --> 01:27:05.685
he got the money
and to thank you.

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:08.555
He got the money?

01:27:12.091 --> 01:27:16.029
You're saying he got the money.

01:27:16.063 --> 01:27:17.230
And the bank wants to know

01:27:17.264 --> 01:27:19.834
how you'd like to invest
the surplus cash.

01:27:22.236 --> 01:27:25.605
Surplus cash... I...
I don't understand.

01:27:25.639 --> 01:27:27.875
The medical
device company.

01:27:27.907 --> 01:27:29.977
Remember? You were
the angel investor.

01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:31.745
I thought we sold that
a long time ago.

01:27:31.778 --> 01:27:33.848
It was buried in that
special little account

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.248
you never look at.

01:27:35.282 --> 01:27:38.552
The shit pile.

01:27:38.585 --> 01:27:40.788
Anyway, I guess it wasn't
worthless after all.

01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:41.756
There was a big buy-out,

01:27:41.788 --> 01:27:43.491
and the fund's share
of the purchase price

01:27:43.523 --> 01:27:44.825
hit the account moments ago.

01:27:48.161 --> 01:27:51.165
May I ask what
you're doing with that?

01:27:51.197 --> 01:27:54.133
Oh, what, the gun?
Oh, nothing, really.

01:27:54.166 --> 01:27:55.902
Uh, so, let me
get this straight.

01:27:55.935 --> 01:27:58.772
You're saying that
the fund has surplus cash,

01:27:58.804 --> 01:28:01.908
and our client is happy?

01:28:01.942 --> 01:28:04.212
Mmm-hmm.

01:28:05.011 --> 01:28:07.915
Ah, this calls
for a celebration.

01:28:08.614 --> 01:28:09.817
Special dinner.

01:28:10.983 --> 01:28:14.020
Veronica, I'm feelin' lucky.

01:28:14.054 --> 01:28:16.991
Go out, get some flowers,
the ones you really like.

01:28:18.759 --> 01:28:20.861
And make a reservation for two.

01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:22.797
At that romantic little place?

01:28:23.296 --> 01:28:25.131
Good idea.

01:28:25.165 --> 01:28:26.901
That sounds wonderful.

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:29.603
But I... I don't have
anything to wear.

01:28:29.635 --> 01:28:30.870
You don't have
to worry about that.

01:28:30.903 --> 01:28:32.506
No need for you to go.

01:28:33.907 --> 01:28:35.009
Zachery.

01:28:36.276 --> 01:28:39.212
Veronica, we're in
the office, remember?

01:28:39.246 --> 01:28:40.614
Call me "sir".

01:28:41.047 --> 01:28:42.882
No.

01:28:42.916 --> 01:28:46.120
Tonight, I want to talk
with that doctor, alone.

01:28:46.153 --> 01:28:48.556
I want to discuss
my heart center with her.

01:28:48.956 --> 01:28:50.024
Yes.

01:28:50.056 --> 01:28:53.294
On a day like today,
I think a little philanthropy

01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:57.331
will go a very long way.

01:28:57.363 --> 01:28:59.899
In fact, don't bother
with the flowers.

01:28:59.933 --> 01:29:01.268
I'll pick them up myself.

01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:05.238
But you could check
into my IMAX home theater.

01:29:05.272 --> 01:29:07.741
I'm thinking about
upgrading the upholstery

01:29:07.773 --> 01:29:08.843
to zebra skin.

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:11.913
You know, Veronica,

01:29:11.946 --> 01:29:13.647
I'm beginning to think
that my old teacher,

01:29:13.679 --> 01:29:16.849
Professor Wrightway,
might've been mistaken.

01:29:16.882 --> 01:29:20.254
He used to say there's
always a price to pay for

01:29:20.287 --> 01:29:23.023
unsportsmanlike behavior.

01:29:23.055 --> 01:29:26.660
And until now,
I believed him.

01:29:28.194 --> 01:29:30.665
Maybe sometimes,
there is no price.

01:29:31.665 --> 01:29:35.301
Maybe sometimes,
you can get away

01:29:35.335 --> 01:29:37.004
with being a bastard.

01:29:39.973 --> 01:29:40.908
What do you think?

01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:43.611
I'm going with the professor
on this one...

01:29:45.077 --> 01:29:46.112
...sir.
