03:14.611 --> 03:17.113
The feeling begins.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.616
Very tender, very loving.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.996
Then the pain starts.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.166
Claws slip underneath the skin
and tear their way up.

03:29.251 --> 03:33.588
Just before they reach my eyes,
they dig in.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.801
Then I remember.

03:43.432 --> 03:47.059
First, I fasted
for three months.

03:47.144 --> 03:51.105
I even whipped myself
before I went to sleep.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.150
At first it worked.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.862
Then the pain came back.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.739
And the voices.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.075
They call me by name -

04:04.119 --> 04:06.078
Jesus.

04:17.673 --> 04:20.593
Who is it? Who are you?
Why are you following me?

04:47.079 --> 04:49.121
Are you ready?

04:51.625 --> 04:54.752
No, no. No more crosses.
We're ready.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.549
Do you hear? Where's your mind?
Do you hear what I'm saying?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.802
The Messiah won't come that way.

05:05.097 --> 05:09.517
What do you mean by that?
Who told you?

05:23.281 --> 05:25.491
You're a disgrace!

05:26.576 --> 05:29.662
The Romans can't find anybody
to make crosses except for you!

05:29.746 --> 05:32.832
You do it!
You're worse than them!

05:32.916 --> 05:36.919
You're a Jew killing Jews!
You're a coward!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.349
How will you ever pay
for your sins?

05:51.435 --> 05:56.355
With my life, Judas.
I don't have anything else.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.491
Don't turn away.
Look at me. Look at me.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.202
With your life?
What do you mean?

06:10.287 --> 06:14.582
Please, Judas.
I don't know. I don't know.

06:28.722 --> 06:31.599
- Are you still taking the cross?
- Yes, I am.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.393
No, you're not.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.023
I won't let you!
No! I won't let you!

06:39.107 --> 06:41.233
Please, I beg you, Judas.
Don't get in the way.

06:41.318 --> 06:44.570
What way? What's happened to you?
Who's doing this to you?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.822
I'm struggling.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.575
- With who?
- I don't know. I'm struggling.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.787
No.

06:56.166 --> 06:59.418
I struggle.
You collaborate.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.710
Leave him alone. Are you ready?

08:28.425 --> 08:30.718
Stop him! Stop him!

08:34.097 --> 08:36.140
Traitor!

08:44.941 --> 08:47.735
You are the people of Israel.
Your children are watching.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.696
You are the people of God.
He is judging us.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.157
He's watching you. Please.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.910
- There he is.
- Kill him!

08:55.994 --> 08:58.329
Don't touch him!
Get away from him!

08:58.413 --> 09:00.748
- Don't defend him.
- He's my son!

09:34.950 --> 09:38.911
God is with us. He's judging us.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.205
Fight! Fight!

09:41.289 --> 09:44.458
God help us! God give us strength!

09:44.542 --> 09:46.293
Give us strength now!

10:05.563 --> 10:07.606
You are His children.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.151
You are His children.

10:27.085 --> 10:29.336
Come. Come with me.

10:29.421 --> 10:33.674
This man naked before you
now is condemned for sedition...

10:35.135 --> 10:38.470
for lifting his hand against Rome.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.682
He rallied the people to revolution.

10:43.518 --> 10:47.104
He promised that a Messiah would come
from among the people...

10:47.188 --> 10:50.107
to rise up and destroy Rome.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.609
- Rome is nothing.
- Murder.

10:52.694 --> 10:56.947
- It's small.
- Betrayal, looting, and so on.

10:57.032 --> 11:00.951
And so, therefore,
he is condemned to die.

11:01.036 --> 11:03.370
Rome condemns him.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.665
And all the gods
of Rome condemn him.

11:12.464 --> 11:16.550
The shield is -
He is - He is our heart.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.179
He is our heart.
He is our heart.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.057
He is our -
He is our shield.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.434
- Lazarus.
- He is our shield.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.561
He is our shield.
He will not abandon you.

11:27.645 --> 11:31.648
He will not abandon you.
He will not abandon you.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.233
He will not abandon you.
He will not -

11:41.868 --> 11:45.454
Mercy on him. Mercy on him.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.889
Aaah! No!

12:03.973 --> 12:06.558
- No.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.853
God loves me. I know He loves me.

12:09.938 --> 12:14.316
I want him to stop.
I can't take the pain.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.819
The voices and the pain.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.321
- I want Him to hate me.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.532
I fight Him and make crosses
so He'll hate me.

12:21.616 --> 12:23.409
I want Him to find somebody else.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.744
I want to crucify
every one of his Messiahs.

12:32.585 --> 12:36.338
You're sure it's God?
You're sure it's not the devil?

12:36.423 --> 12:39.091
I'm not sure.
I'm not sure of anything.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.677
If it's the devil,
the devil can be cast out.

12:41.761 --> 12:45.848
But what if it's God?
You can't cast out God, can you?

13:40.820 --> 13:43.113
Who's that?
Who's following me? Is that you?

13:56.586 --> 13:59.505
Magdalene. Magdalene.

15:02.402 --> 15:07.155
Thank you, Lord, for bringing me
where I did not want to go.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.124
He must be one of God's angels...

15:18.543 --> 15:21.044
who came down
to show me the way.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.549
Who's out there?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.980
Who is it?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.325
What are you doing here?

18:38.409 --> 18:40.952
I want you to forgive me.

18:44.415 --> 18:47.459
I've done too many bad things.

18:48.294 --> 18:52.464
I'm going to the desert,
and I need you to forgive me...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.009
before I go.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.594
Please.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.138
Oh, I see.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.643
You sit out there all day
with the others.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.522
And then you come in here
with your head down, saying...

19:08.606 --> 19:10.482
"Forgive me"?

19:11.692 --> 19:13.193
"Forgive me."

19:15.988 --> 19:18.156
It's not that easy.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.410
Just because you need forgiveness,
don't ask me to do it.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.789
- I'm sorry, Mary.
- Now get out! Go away!

19:27.750 --> 19:31.378
Look, Mary. Look at this.

19:31.462 --> 19:35.090
God can change this.
God can save your soul.

19:35.174 --> 19:38.176
He already broke my heart.
He took you away from me.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.804
And I hate both of you!

19:40.888 --> 19:43.473
Hate me. Blame me.
It's all my fault.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.434
But not God's.
Don't say that about God.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.687
Who made me feel
this way about God?

19:48.771 --> 19:51.439
I know.
That's why I'm here.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.901
That's why I want you to forgive me.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.112
I'll pay my debt.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.993
I know...

20:03.077 --> 20:06.913
the worst things I've done
have been to you.

20:10.376 --> 20:14.379
Pay or go away.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.772
Mary...

20:34.567 --> 20:36.151
don't you remember?

20:36.235 --> 20:39.321
No, I don't remember.
Why should I?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.407
Nothing's changed.

20:44.619 --> 20:46.620
Save the truth.

20:52.460 --> 20:54.669
You want to save my soul?

20:56.297 --> 20:58.506
This is where you'll find it.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.761
You know that.

21:05.556 --> 21:09.476
You're the same as all the others,
only you can't admit it.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.439
You're pitiful.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.235
I hate you.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.408
Here's my body.

21:26.827 --> 21:35.335
Save it.

21:36.504 --> 21:40.131
Oh! Is that the way
you show you're a man?

21:42.134 --> 21:43.760
Turn away.
Don't look at me.

21:43.844 --> 21:47.681
You never had the courage
to be a man. Don't look at me.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.476
If you weren't hanging on to your mother,
you were hanging on to me.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.478
Now you're hanging on to God.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.064
Going to the desert to hide
because you're scared.

21:56.148 --> 22:00.485
Well, go. Whenever I see you,
my heart breaks.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.424
I do remember
when we were children.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.554
Never have I felt so much
tenderness toward anyone...

22:27.638 --> 22:29.848
as I felt toward you then.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.353
All I ever wanted was you.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.064
Nothing else.

22:38.816 --> 22:40.942
What do you think I wanted?

22:42.069 --> 22:45.488
Please... stay.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.620
Is it so bad
sharing a prostitute's room?

22:52.705 --> 22:55.832
I won't touch you. I promise.
You'll still be a virgin for the desert.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.460
Mary, I'm sorry. I can't stay.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.028
Welcome. This way.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.200
Do you always pray
this late at night?

23:30.284 --> 23:34.496
It's a funeral.
The master of the monastery died.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.208
Shall I pray with you?

23:38.292 --> 23:41.669
No. Sleep.
You must be tired.

23:44.924 --> 23:48.593
I know who you are.

24:34.473 --> 24:38.143
That was the man
who brought me here last night.

24:40.187 --> 24:44.649
Last night?
He was dead last night.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.544
The master's soul is gone to heaven.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.506
His body's work is completed.

25:09.592 --> 25:12.969
It walked under the sun
and the moon...

25:13.053 --> 25:15.930
over sand and stone...

25:16.015 --> 25:19.309
sinned, felt pain...

25:19.393 --> 25:21.269
yearned for heaven.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.732
We commend his remains to our god.

25:26.817 --> 25:30.945
Flesh, the master
no longer needs you.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.073
Melt away.

25:42.291 --> 25:45.585
First came the wings,
then the angel.

25:46.170 --> 25:48.338
His spirit actually appeared to you.

25:48.422 --> 25:50.757
He treated you like a royal visitor.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.884
He recognized you for something.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.470
No, he couldn't have
recognized me for anything.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.265
I only came here to serve God.
That's all.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.476
That's all God wants from me.
I'm sure of it.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.228
But think of how you're blessed.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.314
God actually makes himself
known to you.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.025
I don't know what God wants from me.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.611
All my life I've wanted
to hear God's voice.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.821
I've dedicated my life to Him.

26:15.407 --> 26:18.201
Sometimes...
I think I feel Him...

26:18.285 --> 26:20.745
but I'm never really sure.

26:21.455 --> 26:23.206
But you always know.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.458
God took you by the hand
and brought you here.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.464
You think it's a blessing
to know what God wants?

26:32.091 --> 26:36.177
I'll tell you what He wants.
He wants to push me over!

26:37.513 --> 26:40.682
Can't He see
what's inside of me?

26:40.766 --> 26:42.767
All my sins?

26:42.851 --> 26:45.270
- We all sin.
- Not my sins.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.524
I'm a liar, a hypocrite.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.944
I'm afraid of everything.
I don't ever tell the truth.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.029
I don't have the courage.

26:56.782 --> 26:59.701
When I see a woman,
I blush and look away.

26:59.785 --> 27:02.203
I want her, but I don't
take her... for God.

27:02.288 --> 27:06.708
And that makes me proud.
And then my pride ruins Magdalene.

27:07.376 --> 27:10.128
I don't steal, I don't fight
and I don't kill.

27:10.212 --> 27:13.131
Not because I don't want to,
but because I'm afraid.

27:13.215 --> 27:16.926
I want to rebel against you,
against everything, again -

27:17.011 --> 27:21.472
against God, but... I'm afraid.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.770
You want to know
who my mother and father are?

27:29.148 --> 27:31.482
You want to know who my god is?

27:32.860 --> 27:34.360
Fear.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.072
You look inside me,
and that's all you'll find.

27:40.743 --> 27:42.744
But the more devils
that we have inside of us...

27:42.828 --> 27:45.830
the more of a chance
we have to repent.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.833
Lucifer is inside me.

27:50.502 --> 27:55.465
He says to me,
"You're not the son of King David.

27:55.549 --> 27:58.426
You're not a man.
You're the son of man.

27:58.510 --> 28:03.097
And more. The Son of God.
And more than that. God."

28:10.147 --> 28:13.232
Do you want to ask me anything else?

28:52.147 --> 28:55.024
Everything is from God.

28:55.109 --> 28:58.194
Everything has two meanings.

28:58.278 --> 29:01.697
Jesus, oh, my sweet Jesus.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.741
I forgive you.

29:05.244 --> 29:09.080
Leave me! Leave me.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.384
They're gone.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.262
You have to leave too.

29:24.847 --> 29:26.389
No.

29:27.015 --> 29:30.435
- I have to stay.
- No, you've been purified.

29:30.936 --> 29:35.940
God has just blessed you.
The snakes came from inside you.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.860
Now you have to leave too.
You have to go back...

29:38.944 --> 29:41.737
and speak to people
and share your heart.

29:41.822 --> 29:43.698
Speak to who?

29:43.782 --> 29:47.118
- To anyone who will listen.
- And say what?

29:47.703 --> 29:51.539
Just open your mouth.
Do you love mankind?

29:51.623 --> 29:55.334
I see men, and I feel sorry for them.
That's all.

29:55.419 --> 29:58.963
That's enough.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.989
- I've got orders to kill you.
- Go ahead. Tonight I was purified.

30:25.073 --> 30:29.243
I can't fight with God anymore.
Here. Here's my neck. Cut it.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.828
I'm ready.

30:42.883 --> 30:46.219
What are you?
What kind of a man are you?

30:49.014 --> 30:51.474
What you want, I want.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.768
That's why He brought us together.
It's God's plan.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.104
I come to kill you and you help me,
that's God's plan?

30:57.189 --> 31:01.192
These voices you hear, it's God's voice?
Only you understand it?

31:02.402 --> 31:04.403
Well, you better make me
understand it too.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.156
I'll tell you as much as I know.

31:11.370 --> 31:14.539
The fainting spells,
the voices, the visions.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.416
Power, magic.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.296
Is there some secret?

31:26.885 --> 31:30.888
- Tell me your secret.
- Pity.

31:30.973 --> 31:35.142
- Pity for who? Yourself?
- Pity for men.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.771
- Our enemies are men.
- I feel pity for everything.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.526
Donkeys, grass, sparrows.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.653
What about ants?
Feel pity for them too?

31:45.737 --> 31:49.657
Yes. Everything's a part of God.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.786
When I see an ant,
when I look at his shiny black eye...

31:54.746 --> 31:56.831
you know what I see?

31:57.624 --> 32:00.042
I see the face of God.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.009
You're not afraid of dying?

32:08.093 --> 32:09.844
Why should I be?

32:11.096 --> 32:14.724
Death isn't a door that closes.
It opens.

32:14.808 --> 32:17.268
It opens, and you go through it.

32:20.814 --> 32:23.190
If I don't kill you,
what happens?

32:23.275 --> 32:25.359
I'll speak to people.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.196
What are you going to say?

32:29.906 --> 32:33.409
I'll just open my mouth,
and God will do the talking.

32:53.639 --> 32:55.139
Mmm.

33:00.145 --> 33:03.230
Maybe God didn't send you here
to kill me.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.778
Maybe He sent you here
to follow me.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.347
Just so there's no mistake...

33:36.431 --> 33:39.100
I'll go with you until I understand.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.478
But if you stray this much...

33:42.562 --> 33:45.523
from the path, I'll kill you.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.204
Stop!

34:06.753 --> 34:09.964
It's Magdalene.
She deserves it.

34:15.554 --> 34:18.723
- Stone her!

34:20.766 --> 34:23.436
Get out of there!
Get out of there! Get out of the way!

34:23.520 --> 34:25.771
This is not your business!
Do you want to get hurt?

34:25.856 --> 34:27.940
Didn't you hear
what he said, idiot? Move!

34:28.024 --> 34:30.609
No. I don't want this.

34:30.694 --> 34:34.572
Listen to him.
He doesn't want this. Well, we want it.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.118
- Why?
- We don't have to tell you why!

34:39.202 --> 34:40.953
Bad enough we live
in a whorehouse.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.496
But she's a Jew.
She works on the Sabbath.

34:43.581 --> 34:48.085
She goes with Romans on the Sabbath.
She broke Moses' law. She dies.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.689
Who has never sinned? Who?

35:13.236 --> 35:16.113
Which one of you people
has never sinned?

35:21.995 --> 35:26.165
Whoever that is...
come up here!

35:28.126 --> 35:30.336
And throw these!

35:33.965 --> 35:36.050
I have nothing to hide.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.594
Good. Take this. It's bigger.

35:42.307 --> 35:44.975
Be careful, Zebedee.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.854
There is a god.

35:49.773 --> 35:52.024
He's seen you cheat your workers.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.902
He's seen you with that widow.
What's her name?

35:54.986 --> 35:58.155
- Judith.
- Judith.

35:59.199 --> 36:03.494
Aren't you afraid God will paralyse you
if you lift that stone?

36:03.578 --> 36:06.372
That your arm will wither?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.708
That you'll lose all strength?

36:52.377 --> 36:55.004
God has so many miracles.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.799
What if I say the wrong thing?

36:58.884 --> 37:01.385
What if I say the right thing?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.354
Come closer.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.068
Come closer.
We're all a family.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.573
Come closer so you can hear.

37:23.116 --> 37:25.576
I have something to tell you.

37:26.161 --> 37:28.078
Who is he?

37:28.163 --> 37:30.497
It's Jesus from Nazareth.

37:30.582 --> 37:34.001
Nothing good can come out of Nazareth.
Even the scriptures say so.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.128
Uh...

37:38.757 --> 37:41.550
I'm - I'm sorry, but...

37:43.595 --> 37:46.764
the easiest way
to make myself clear...

37:47.849 --> 37:49.892
is to tell you a story.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.941
A farmer was planting in his field.

37:57.025 --> 38:01.946
Some seed fell on the ground,
and the birds ate it.

38:02.030 --> 38:06.283
Some seed fell on rocks
and dried up.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.578
But some seed -

38:09.663 --> 38:13.666
Some seed fell on rich soil...

38:13.750 --> 38:17.461
and grew into enough wheat
to feed a whole nation.

38:24.010 --> 38:26.929
- Can you hear me?
- Oh, we can hear you fine.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.265
I'm the farmer!
The farmer is me.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.268
And two and two makes four.
Another lunatic!

38:33.353 --> 38:37.731
Rabbi, tell me.
If you're the farmer...

38:37.816 --> 38:39.900
and we're the stones...

38:39.985 --> 38:42.027
what's the seed?

38:44.656 --> 38:46.824
What's the seed?

38:50.161 --> 38:52.121
Love.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.416
Love one another.

38:57.002 --> 39:00.754
That's easy to say. Maybe that's
good advice, but for some other world.

39:00.839 --> 39:04.341
These people are starving.
First you feed them, then you talk.

39:04.426 --> 39:07.970
Listen. I used to think God was angry too,
but not anymore!

39:08.054 --> 39:10.597
He used to jump on me
like a wild bird...

39:10.682 --> 39:13.434
and dig His claws into my head.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.562
But then one morning,
He came to me.

39:17.147 --> 39:19.982
He blew over me
like a cool breeze...

39:20.066 --> 39:23.027
and said, "Stand up."

39:26.865 --> 39:29.074
And here I am.

39:29.159 --> 39:32.453
- And you will go to hell.
- These are children's stories.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.747
- How can they help us?
- What are you hungry for?

39:34.831 --> 39:36.623
What are you thirsty for?
For justice.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.625
- Justice!
- And bread.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.754
Bread? Bread too.
You're thirsty for justice...

39:41.838 --> 39:43.756
for people to treat you fairly...

39:43.840 --> 39:45.674
for people to treat you with respect.

39:45.759 --> 39:49.428
What I'm telling you is,
whoever's hungry for justice...

39:49.512 --> 39:51.638
they're the ones
who'll be blessed.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.808
They'll be filled with bread.
They'll never be hungry again.

39:54.893 --> 40:00.355
They'll have the real value, the value
of love - to love, share and comfort.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.524
They'll have the courage
to do the good.

40:02.609 --> 40:05.069
And you - you're mourning.

40:05.653 --> 40:07.780
Mourners will be blessed.

40:07.864 --> 40:11.533
You'll have God to comfort you.
You won't need men to do it.

40:11.618 --> 40:14.161
And the meek - they're the ones
who will be blessed.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.163
And the suffering -
they'll be blessed too.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.874
And the peacemakers
and the merciful...

40:18.958 --> 40:21.335
and the sick and the poor
and the outcast.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.047
You'll all be blessed,
because heaven is yours!

40:27.675 --> 40:29.760
And believe me -

40:33.932 --> 40:38.227
Believe me,
those who are laughing now...

40:38.311 --> 40:40.437
will be crying later.

40:40.522 --> 40:43.732
Those whose stomachs are filled now
will be hungry later.

40:43.817 --> 40:46.276
And the rich will be poor forever!

40:46.361 --> 40:48.904
- Kill the rich!
- Kill them! Kill them!

40:48.988 --> 40:51.073
- Kill the rich!

40:52.700 --> 40:56.829
No! I-I-I didn't -
I didn't say death!

40:59.499 --> 41:06.004
I said love!

41:13.638 --> 41:16.723
- Enough. Come.
- No, Father, I'm staying.

41:16.808 --> 41:19.143
We have to work.
I need you.

41:19.227 --> 41:20.727
John!

41:22.897 --> 41:25.274
- Come.
- I'm sorry, Father. I'm staying too.

41:25.358 --> 41:27.860
Oh, no, no, no.
Not the two of you! Come on!

41:30.280 --> 41:32.406
Let me come with you.
I can help.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.784
No. Stay here.

41:38.079 --> 41:40.664
You'll know when.

41:41.708 --> 41:43.959
Tell people about me.

42:28.838 --> 42:30.422
James.

42:37.263 --> 42:39.223
Andrew.

43:16.928 --> 43:18.845
Move over, John.

43:20.014 --> 43:22.808
- Move over, James.
- What? I was just comfortable.

43:22.892 --> 43:25.602
- Peter wants to lie down.
- Peter, there's no more room.

43:25.687 --> 43:27.646
I'm cold. I want to be by the fire.

43:27.730 --> 43:30.524
Well, go over by Phillip. We're all cold.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.442
Shut up.

43:42.412 --> 43:44.871
Rabbi, can I talk to you?

43:50.044 --> 43:52.713
I'm not like these other men.

43:52.797 --> 43:55.632
I mean, they're good enough.
They're good men.

43:55.717 --> 43:57.634
But they're weak.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.220
One's worse than the other.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.556
Where'd you find them?

44:02.640 --> 44:04.558
Look at me.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.894
If I love somebody,
I would die for them.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.814
If I hate somebody, I kill them.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.651
I could even kill somebody I loved
if they did the wrong thing.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.741
Did you hear me?
Do you understand what I said?

44:20.825 --> 44:22.993
Yes, I understand.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.496
The other day you said if a man hits you,
you turn the other cheek.

44:26.998 --> 44:29.041
I didn't like that.

44:29.751 --> 44:32.252
Only an angel could do that.
Or a dog.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.004
I'm sorry, but I'm neither.

44:34.088 --> 44:36.631
I'm a free man.
I don't turn my cheek to anyone.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.552
We both want the same thing.

44:41.971 --> 44:43.263
We do?

44:43.348 --> 44:45.599
You want freedom for Israel?

44:45.683 --> 44:49.353
No. I want freedom for the soul.

44:49.437 --> 44:51.855
No. That's what I can't accept.

44:51.939 --> 44:55.067
That's not the same thing.
It's not the same thing!

44:55.151 --> 44:59.363
First you free the body, then you free
the spirit. The Romans come first.

44:59.447 --> 45:02.866
You don't build a house from the roof down.
You build it from the foundation up.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.910
The foundation is the soul.

45:04.994 --> 45:07.996
The foundation is the body!
That's where you must begin.

45:08.081 --> 45:11.041
No. If you don't change the spirit first,
change what's inside...

45:11.125 --> 45:13.627
then you're only gonna replace
the Romans with somebody else...

45:13.711 --> 45:15.796
and nothing ever changes.

45:15.880 --> 45:19.174
Even if you're victorious,
you'll still be filled with the poison.

45:19.258 --> 45:22.219
You've got to break
the chain of evil.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.600
How do you change, then?

45:29.977 --> 45:32.396
- With love.

45:32.480 --> 45:35.232
- Who's there?
- It's me, Andrew.

45:35.316 --> 45:36.983
Is everything -

45:37.068 --> 45:40.529
It's all right. Go back to sleep.
Judas and I are talking.

45:43.783 --> 45:45.867
There's an example.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.134
You know, the Zealots
ordered me to kill you.

46:02.718 --> 46:04.886
Why did you change your mind?

46:07.348 --> 46:09.683
I decided to wait.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.685
For what?

46:11.769 --> 46:15.856
I thought maybe you were the one...
to unite us.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.858
I didn't want to destroy that.

46:17.942 --> 46:21.987
How do we know?
How could I be the Messiah?

46:22.822 --> 46:27.033
When those people were torturing
Magdalene, I wanted to kill them.

46:27.535 --> 46:31.538
And then I opened my mouth...
and out comes the word "love."

46:31.622 --> 46:34.374
Why? I don't understand.

46:36.085 --> 46:39.463
You can't look to the others for answers.
All they can do is follow you.

46:45.553 --> 46:48.847
We'll go to Judaea
and see John the Baptist.

46:50.600 --> 46:54.352
Every day he tells hundreds of people
the Messiah is coming. He'll know.

46:55.771 --> 46:57.022
He'll know.

46:57.106 --> 47:00.400
Judas... I'm afraid.

47:03.404 --> 47:05.447
Stay with me.

48:31.075 --> 48:35.245
Behold! I will raise up
evil against you out of your own house.

48:35.329 --> 48:39.833
And I will take your wives before your eyes
and give them to your neighbour.

48:39.917 --> 48:44.254
And he shall lie with your wives
in the sight of this sun.

48:44.338 --> 48:48.592
You may listen and listen again,
but you will never understand.

48:48.676 --> 48:51.803
You may look and look,
but you will never know.

48:51.887 --> 48:54.848
These people's wits are dulled!

48:54.932 --> 48:58.768
Their ears are deafened
and their eyes blinded...

48:58.853 --> 49:02.272
so they cannot see with their eyes
nor hear with their ears...

49:02.356 --> 49:05.817
so that they may turn
and be healed!

49:05.901 --> 49:09.029
The Lord of Hosts says,
"On this day" -

49:09.113 --> 49:12.282
- He sounds like the Messiah.
- No.

49:12.366 --> 49:15.160
"I will crush the horns
of the new moon...

49:15.244 --> 49:18.371
and I will spill darkness
over the world.

49:18.456 --> 49:22.250
I will reverse your laughter,
turn it into tears" -

49:22.335 --> 49:25.295
Go in front.
Let him see you.

49:25.838 --> 49:30.258
Hands, feet, noses, ears
will fall to the ground.

49:30.343 --> 49:34.638
Listen. It is the thunder
of many people.

49:34.722 --> 49:38.808
Even from behind,
I knew I had seen him before.

49:39.352 --> 49:42.729
Where? Was it a dream?

49:44.315 --> 49:47.400
Yes, it was.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.904
But in the dream,
he was dressed in white.

49:50.988 --> 49:54.407
You will have the smell
of decay and branding...

49:54.492 --> 49:56.451
instead of beauty.

49:56.535 --> 49:59.496
Your men shall fall by the sword...

49:59.580 --> 50:03.333
and your women shall sit
on the ground, stripped bare!

50:03.417 --> 50:05.335
Who are you?

50:07.088 --> 50:09.339
Do you recognize me?

50:11.258 --> 50:13.176
Who are you?

50:15.763 --> 50:20.684
Do you know the prophets?
What does Isaiah say?

50:21.227 --> 50:25.021
He says,
"Prepare the way of the Lord."

50:27.483 --> 50:29.442
Are you telling me that's you?

50:29.527 --> 50:31.528
I don't know. Tell me.

50:41.914 --> 50:43.665
Why are you here?

50:43.749 --> 50:45.959
To be baptized.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.253
No, no. I don't dare.

50:48.337 --> 50:52.841
If you're the master,
then you have to baptize me.

50:55.344 --> 50:57.554
Baptize me.

51:41.807 --> 51:43.933
Love. What does it mean?

51:44.018 --> 51:47.187
Love is sweet as honey,
but it's also blood.

51:47.271 --> 51:50.607
Love is action. You want a new crop,
you burn the earth.

51:50.691 --> 51:52.358
But isn't love enough?

51:52.443 --> 51:54.235
No, no!
Look at the world. Look around you.

51:54.320 --> 51:57.197
Plague, war, corruption,
false prophets...

51:57.281 --> 52:00.325
false idols, worship of gold.

52:00.409 --> 52:04.204
Nothing is of value.
The tree is rotten.

52:04.288 --> 52:07.290
You have to take the axe
and cut it down.

52:07.374 --> 52:10.835
If I was a woodcutter, I'd cut.
If I was a fire, I'd burn.

52:10.920 --> 52:13.671
But I'm a heart and I love.
That's all I can do.

52:13.756 --> 52:17.217
I'm a heart also,
but I can't love what's unjust.

52:17.301 --> 52:20.053
What I can't love, I attack.
God demands it.

52:20.137 --> 52:22.305
- Anger?
- Yes, God demands anger.

52:22.389 --> 52:25.558
Anger?
But we're all brothers.

52:25.643 --> 52:28.186
You think love is God's only way?

52:28.270 --> 52:30.730
Go to the Dead Sea.
Look in the bottom.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.067
You'll see two whores,
Sodom and Gomorrah.

52:34.151 --> 52:36.319
That's God's way.

52:37.029 --> 52:41.199
On the day of the Lord,
blood will flow from wood.

52:41.283 --> 52:46.704
The stones of the houses will come alive
and kill their owners.

52:46.789 --> 52:49.749
That day is here.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.710
He gave me the axe.
Now I give it to you.

52:53.712 --> 52:55.672
That's not the answer.

52:56.507 --> 52:58.550
Then what is the answer?

52:59.802 --> 53:01.511
I don't know.

53:02.471 --> 53:05.431
Well, if you won't listen to me,
who will you listen to?

53:05.516 --> 53:07.267
God.

53:07.351 --> 53:10.270
The God of Israel
is a god of the desert.

53:10.354 --> 53:15.358
If you want to speak to Him,
then you'll have to go to the desert.

53:17.069 --> 53:19.279
I'll go to Idumaea.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.908
Thank you, Baptist.

53:32.543 --> 53:36.546
Be careful.
God isn't alone out there.

54:15.252 --> 54:17.879
I'm not going to leave this circle.

54:18.923 --> 54:22.675
I'm not going to leave here
until You speak to me.

54:23.552 --> 54:26.846
No signs. No pain.

54:27.723 --> 54:31.100
Just speak to me in human words.

54:32.895 --> 54:36.981
Whatever path You want, I'll take.

54:37.608 --> 54:40.193
Love... or the axe...

54:40.277 --> 54:42.278
or anything else.

54:42.363 --> 54:46.324
Or if You want me to stay here and die,
I'll do that too.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.827
But You have to tell me.

55:48.303 --> 55:53.599
I feel sorry for you. You were lonely.

55:53.684 --> 55:57.311
You cried. So I came.

55:58.022 --> 56:01.983
I didn't call for you.
Who are you?

56:02.067 --> 56:04.235
Your spirit.

56:04.319 --> 56:06.279
My spirit?

56:06.363 --> 56:09.073
You're afraid of being alone.

56:09.158 --> 56:11.617
You're just like Adam.

56:12.202 --> 56:16.122
He called me,
and I took one of his ribs...

56:16.206 --> 56:18.499
and made it into a woman.

56:18.584 --> 56:20.626
You're here to trick me.

56:20.711 --> 56:22.712
Trick you?

56:22.796 --> 56:24.464
To love and care for a woman...

56:24.548 --> 56:27.258
to have a family -
this is a trick?

56:28.719 --> 56:31.554
Why are you trying
to save the world?

56:32.181 --> 56:34.599
Aren't your own sins
enough for you?

56:35.392 --> 56:38.394
What arrogance to think
you can save the world.

56:38.937 --> 56:41.689
The world doesn't have to be saved.

56:42.733 --> 56:44.776
Save yourself.

56:45.736 --> 56:47.445
Find love.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.906
I have love.

56:49.990 --> 56:53.618
Look... in my eyes.

56:54.453 --> 56:56.412
Look at my breasts.

56:57.581 --> 56:59.916
Do you recognize them?

57:00.834 --> 57:02.835
Just nod your head...

57:03.420 --> 57:05.838
and we'll be in my bed together.

57:08.175 --> 57:11.094
Oh... Jesus!

57:35.786 --> 57:38.287
After ten days...

57:38.372 --> 57:40.915
the hunger went away.

57:55.806 --> 57:58.891
Welcome, Jesus. Congratulations.

57:59.560 --> 58:02.979
You're past the small temptations
of a woman, a family.

58:03.063 --> 58:05.898
- We're both bigger than that.
- Who are you?

58:05.983 --> 58:07.650
You don't recognize me?

58:10.529 --> 58:13.030
I'm you. I'm your heart.

58:13.657 --> 58:16.534
Your heart is so greedy.

58:16.618 --> 58:18.995
It pretends to be humble...

58:19.079 --> 58:21.164
but it really wants
to conquer the world.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.749
I never wanted
a kingdom on earth.

58:25.335 --> 58:28.337
- The kingdom of heaven is enough.
- You're a liar!

58:29.381 --> 58:31.591
When you were making crosses
for the Romans in Nazareth...

58:31.675 --> 58:34.468
your head was exploding
with dreams of power!

58:34.553 --> 58:36.637
Power over everyone.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.932
You said it was God,
but you really wanted power.

58:40.893 --> 58:43.102
Now you can have what you want.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.646
Any country you want.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.650
All of them.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.154
- You could even have Rome.
- Liar.

58:53.238 --> 58:55.865
Step into my circle
so I can pull your tongue out.

59:20.265 --> 59:22.892
Archangel, move back.

59:22.976 --> 59:25.019
Move back. You're blinding me.

59:25.103 --> 59:27.021
Jesus.

59:28.106 --> 59:30.858
I'm the one
you've been waiting for.

59:32.069 --> 59:35.655
Remember...
when you were a little boy?

59:36.949 --> 59:41.035
You cried, "Make me a god!

59:41.119 --> 59:44.914
God, God, make me a god!"

59:44.998 --> 59:47.833
But I was just a child then.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.919
You are God.

59:50.003 --> 59:53.839
The Baptist knew it.
Now it's time you admit it.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.925
You are His Son.

59:56.009 --> 59:59.178
The only Son of God.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:02.014
Join me. Join me.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.351
Together, we'll rule
the living and the dead.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.853
You'll give life,
and you'll take life.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:11.565
You'll sit in judgment,
and I'll sit next to you.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:14.819
Imagine how strong
we could be together.

01:00:15.404 --> 01:00:16.612
Satan?

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:48.602
We'll see each other again.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:11.083
Don't be afraid.
You are the one.

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:13.377
My work is done.

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:16.422
Now I can die.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:21.552
The Lord wants me
to tell you to stand up.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:25.431
His day is here.
Take this axe.

01:01:25.515 --> 01:01:28.851
Take this message to everyone.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.273
Please.

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:19.110
What do you want?

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:22.530
I'm a foreigner... from Galilee.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:25.574
I'm tired.

01:02:26.576 --> 01:02:28.828
You don't know
how good this tastes.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.872
Some more wine, please?

01:02:35.127 --> 01:02:37.086
Mary.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:40.047
Martha.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:44.093
I want to say
that you're both blessed.

01:02:45.637 --> 01:02:48.556
I came here,
you didn't know me.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:53.686
You took me in,
fed me, restored me...

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.814
and God came down
and went into my heart.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:01.318
- Go on.
- No.

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:04.822
I've talked too much already.
Silence is better.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.783
No, it's not.

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:11.287
Do you have a wife?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.919
- No.
- How can you live like that in the desert?

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.214
Tell me the truth.
Don't you miss all this -

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.216
having a home, a real life?

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:26.093
I admit it.

01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:29.346
- I'd like it, but I'll never have it.
- Listen.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:32.558
If you really want God,
don't spend your time in the desert.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.643
He's not there.
He's right here.

01:03:35.604 --> 01:03:38.397
Read your scriptures.
God doesn't want you to fast and pray.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.483
He wants you to make children.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.737
Mary, you're making him uncomfortable.
He's a guest.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.947
- He knows what I'm talking about.

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:51.619
Come and help me.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:56.749
- It's not right to tease these men.
- I wasn't teasing.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.377
Remember the Baptist?
It's nothing to tease about.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.463
- The Baptist? What?
- He's dead.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:05.925
He was killed by Herod.
You didn't know?

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.676
They say the king was drunk.

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:10.888
They say he cut off his head -
the Baptist's head - to satisfy a girl.

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:15.059
- It happened in his palace in Jerusalem.
- No, at his palace in Tiberius.

01:04:26.154 --> 01:04:29.323
Now they say they're gonna kill
everyone who was baptized.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:32.576
- No one forced you to be baptized.
- You were baptized too.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:34.537
You begged for it, so be quiet.

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:38.541
I can just imagine in Galilee right now.

01:04:39.793 --> 01:04:41.377
The sea.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.965
They say the fishing's so good, you just
touch the nets and the fish jump in.

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:50.553
Don't talk about fish. Reminds me of my sheep.
I don't know what's happened to them.

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:54.890
Maybe we should wait
for him in Galilee.

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:57.184
No, we promised the master we'd wait here.

01:04:57.269 --> 01:05:00.479
That was over a month ago. There are
thousands of people waiting to see him.

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:04.233
They're waiting to hear him, and he's gone.
The whole movement. We look like fools.

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:08.445
- Nathaniel's right. He makes sense.

01:05:08.530 --> 01:05:11.532
- Go back to Galilee like Peter says -
- Brothers!

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:15.452
I don't understand you.

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:19.039
Think of the last words
the Baptist said.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:22.418
He said, "Jesus of Nazareth,
leave the desert.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:26.005
I am finished.
And return to mankind."

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:29.049
- How do we know the Baptist really said that?
- Everybody says he did.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:32.761
- But how do we know?
- Well, even if he didn't, the words are still important.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:34.221
Why?

01:05:35.682 --> 01:05:38.100
Because people believe them.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.771
And what if our master's -

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.443
Well, what if he's the one?

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:55.284
- What one?
- The one.

01:05:55.368 --> 01:05:58.787
What do you mean?
The Messiah?

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.459
We don't know the Baptist said that.

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:08.380
- Nobody knows what they talked about.

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.799
He's saying that the world
of God is here now.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:13.552
What if he just meant...
continue my work?

01:06:13.637 --> 01:06:16.180
Continue to do the same work
that I've been doing.

01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.641
It was right here at the Jordan River
Elijah ascended to heaven.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.684
Doesn't that mean something to you?

01:06:20.769 --> 01:06:23.312
- We're waiting here!

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.650
We're waiting here.

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:39.745
I don't think we should go back to Galilee.
I think we should wait here.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:42.915
That's what I love about you, Peter.

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:45.584
You're as steady
and as solid as a rock.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:49.672
Nobody can change your mind.
What good are you?

01:06:53.343 --> 01:06:54.843
Master.

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:08.148
Rabbi...

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:13.278
John heard your footsteps
in his heart... in a way.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.656
And we were preparing
to welcome you.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:19.326
Were you baptized?

01:07:19.411 --> 01:07:21.161
Yes.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:25.874
John baptized with water
and they killed him.

01:07:25.959 --> 01:07:27.876
Now I baptize with fire.

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:31.505
Is that what the Baptist told you?

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:34.883
I have an invitation for you.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.722
- Is there a celebration?
- No.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:45.185
I'm not inviting you
to a celebration.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:47.688
I'm inviting you to a war.

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:17.091
This is my heart. Take it.

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.929
God is inside of us.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:25.934
The devil is outside us
in the world all around us.

01:08:27.145 --> 01:08:31.982
We'll pick up an axe
and cut the devil's throat.

01:08:32.066 --> 01:08:34.443
We'll fight him wherever he is.

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:39.865
In the sick, in the rich...

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.785
even in the temple.

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:44.953
I'll lead you.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:50.000
If you have sheep,
give them away.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:53.754
If you have a family, leave them.

01:08:57.509 --> 01:08:59.760
I believed in love.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:01.970
Now I believe in this.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.932
Who's with me?

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.772
Adonai.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:21.240
Today and tomorrow
I cast out devils and work cures.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.367
On the third day...

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:26.787
I shall be... perfected.

01:09:54.858 --> 01:09:57.192
Out!

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.906
Satan! Leave!

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:10.038
- Satan, out!

01:10:10.123 --> 01:10:11.707
Leave him!

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.698
Moses, Elijah, Isaiah...

01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:48.368
touch my mouth...

01:10:48.453 --> 01:10:51.246
touch my lips.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:14.895
Go the temple.
Let the high priests see you.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.315
Look!

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:25.864
He was blind, and Jesus healed him.
Look. Look.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:31.119
Look at his eyes. He was blind,
and Jesus healed him. Look. Look. Look.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:36.935
You! You don't belong at a wedding.
We're here to celebrate purity.

01:12:37.020 --> 01:12:40.105
- I'm sorry, but these people are my guests.
- Please.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:42.941
Let me explain something to you.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:45.986
What do you think heaven's like?

01:12:47.155 --> 01:12:49.197
It's like a wedding.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:55.871
God's the bridegroom,
and man's spirit's the bride.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:59.124
The wedding takes place in heaven...

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.169
and everyone's invited.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:05.088
God's world is big enough
for everybody.

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:07.049
Nazarene, that's against the law.

01:13:08.051 --> 01:13:10.218
Then the law is against my heart.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:15.515
Don't touch me.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:19.895
You are now sacred to me
through this ring.

01:13:19.979 --> 01:13:22.689
You are now sacred to me through this ring.

01:13:22.774 --> 01:13:26.401
According to the law
of Moses and Israel.

01:13:26.486 --> 01:13:30.238
According to the laws
of Moses and Israel.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.834
My cousins are very upset.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:46.963
They only bought enough wine for three days.
Now another day's gone past, and it's gone.

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:48.673
What's in those?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.010
- Water.
- No. It's wine.

01:13:52.095 --> 01:13:55.055
- No, no, it's water. I put it there myself.
- It's wine.

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.766
- It's water.
- Go over there and make sure.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:02.062
Do it.

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:22.749
You're right. It is wine.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:23.393
Brothers!

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:27.189
My old friends!
Listen to me!

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:30.442
It's me the prophets
preached about.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:33.111
God talked to me in the desert.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:36.698
He gave me a secret
and told me to bring it to you.

01:15:36.782 --> 01:15:39.367
Didn't you hear me coming?

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:45.457
I ran here to Nazareth,
where I grew up, to bring you the news.

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:48.627
- The world of God is here now.
- You work miracles.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:50.295
Make a miracle for us.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.839
Make us believe in you.
Otherwise, go away.

01:15:52.924 --> 01:15:56.051
The Messiah doesn't need miracles.
He is the miracle.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:59.054
Now he's here.
Are you ready for me?

01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:01.765
I'm here to tear down
everything around you.

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:06.686
And you know what I'm going
to replace it with? Something new.

01:16:06.771 --> 01:16:10.273
God. The world of God.

01:16:10.358 --> 01:16:13.109
So take your bread
and give it to the poor.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:15.904
What difference does it matter
what you own?

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:18.448
You have gold and silver?
It's going to rot.

01:16:18.532 --> 01:16:21.493
And that rot is going to
eat away your heart.

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:25.830
All of you. There will be a flood,
and there will be a fire.

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:30.961
Everything will be destroyed. But there
will be a new ark riding on that fire!

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:35.090
And I hold the keys
and I open the door...

01:16:35.174 --> 01:16:39.386
and I decide who goes in
and who doesn't!

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:44.724
You're my brothers from Nazareth,
and you're the first I invite on the ark.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:49.062
Don't wait.
Don't waste your life.

01:16:49.146 --> 01:16:51.773
- Come with me.
- You're the son of Mary, right?

01:16:51.857 --> 01:16:53.900
Who are you to tell us about God?

01:16:53.985 --> 01:16:57.988
- You made better crosses than speeches.

01:16:58.072 --> 01:17:00.949
Go get somebody from his family
to take him away. He's insane.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:02.951
- What are you laughing at?

01:17:03.035 --> 01:17:08.331
Everything you have is going to burn... soon.
Get out now. Come with me to Jerusalem.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:11.710
See? This is what happens
when a man doesn't get married.

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:13.753
The semen backs up into his brain.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:15.839
- Go home!

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:18.550
You're a demon! You're possessed!
You're a lunatic!

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.593
- This is my home!
- You should be ashamed.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:22.595
Kill him! He's a magician!
He's going to burn us!

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.098
Don't touch him!
The love of God is for the poor!

01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:28.351
If I could touch every stone...

01:17:28.436 --> 01:17:31.980
if I could breathe on every branch,
they'd get up and follow me.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.108
- So what's wrong with you?

01:17:35.192 --> 01:17:37.652
Come with me to Jerusalem!

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:39.946
Jerusalem is falling!

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:42.866
I feel it. I know it.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.380
You see these people?

01:17:57.965 --> 01:18:01.593
They're poor, they're blind,
they're crippled.

01:18:01.677 --> 01:18:04.429
They're going to be our army.

01:18:06.182 --> 01:18:08.308
We're going to need
better men than this.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:13.063
God will give them to me.
We're going to build a new Jerusalem.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.781
Son.
Come back with me, please.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.532
Who are you?

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:29.954
- Your mother.
- I don't have a mother.

01:18:30.039 --> 01:18:32.332
I don't have any family.

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:35.877
I have a father... in heaven.

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:39.255
Don't say that to me.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.093
Who are you?

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:45.845
I mean, really.

01:18:46.722 --> 01:18:48.723
Who are you?

01:19:01.153 --> 01:19:04.656
Mary, why are you crying?

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:06.908
Didn't you see them?

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.662
What?

01:19:10.746 --> 01:19:14.124
When he spoke to you, there were
thousands of blue wings behind him.

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:16.209
I swear to you, Mary,
there were armies of angels.

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:20.255
- There were?
- Thousands.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.135
I'd be happier if there weren't.

01:19:40.609 --> 01:19:42.777
When was he buried?

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.613
Three days ago.

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.579
Roll away the stone.

01:20:47.009 --> 01:20:49.177
Lazarus.

01:20:49.887 --> 01:20:51.971
Lazarus.

01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:00.396
In the name of the prophet...

01:21:01.524 --> 01:21:05.568
in the name of Jeremiah
and my father...

01:21:05.653 --> 01:21:10.114
in the name
of the Most Holy God...

01:21:10.199 --> 01:21:12.534
I call you here.

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:15.870
I call you here!

01:21:22.127 --> 01:21:37.308
Lazarus.

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.130
Adonai.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:34.175
God, help me.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:51.252
We came here to pray.
Look at this.

01:24:51.336 --> 01:24:54.756
The moneychangers?
It's for the temple tax, for the feast.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.051
I know.

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:07.101
- How's the exchange today?
- Fair. At this stall, it's always fair.

01:25:10.105 --> 01:25:12.940
- Making a good profit?
- Fair.

01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:07.411
This is my father's house!

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:11.541
It's a place of worship!
Not a market!

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:16.003
Nazarene, what are you doing?

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:19.340
- What are you doing?

01:26:22.678 --> 01:26:24.595
God doesn't need a palace!

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.973
He doesn't need cypress trees
or dead animals!

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.724
He doesn't need shekels!

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:32.186
You expect people to pay the tax
with Roman coins?

01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.939
They have images
of false gods on them.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.608
You want pagan gods in the temple?

01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:41.779
All foreign coins have to be
exchanged for shekels.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:45.366
- That is the law.
- I'm throwing away the law.

01:26:45.450 --> 01:26:48.619
- I have a new law and a new hope.
- What?

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:52.331
Has God changed his mind
about the old law?

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:57.545
No. No, He just thinks our hearts
are ready to hold more, that's all.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:02.341
This chaos is your new law.
How can you presume -

01:27:02.426 --> 01:27:05.011
How can I presume?
Because I'm the end of the old law...

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.762
and the beginning of the new one!

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:09.473
- Watch what you're saying.
- Maybe we should go.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:14.228
When I say "l", Rabbi,
I'm saying God.

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:18.608
That's blasphemy.

01:27:19.902 --> 01:27:22.528
Didn't they tell you?

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:25.406
I'm the saint of blasphemy.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.742
Don't make any mistakes.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:30.995
I didn't come here to bring peace.
I came to bring a sword.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:34.624
- Talking like that will get you killed.
- Me killed?

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:38.753
Listen to me. This temple will be
destroyed in three days.

01:27:38.837 --> 01:27:40.630
Torn down to the ground!

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:43.674
There won't be one stone
left to build with!

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:48.179
You think God belongs
only to you? He doesn't.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:51.891
God's an immortal spirit
who belongs to everybody!

01:27:51.975 --> 01:27:54.143
To the whole world!

01:27:54.227 --> 01:27:58.940
You think you're special?
God is not an Israelite!

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:26.384
- Magician, heal me.
- Cure us. Make us rich.

01:28:26.468 --> 01:28:29.887
Heal me. Do a miracle. You want me to
enter the world of God crippled like this?

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:34.225
Don't touch me! You're filled with hate!
Get away! God won't help you.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:38.187
- You cure us, or you won't leave this city alive.

01:28:38.271 --> 01:28:41.107
You don't make demands on God!

01:28:46.571 --> 01:28:49.115
Judas, what are you doing
with this magician?

01:28:49.199 --> 01:28:51.409
You had orders to kill him,
and you haven't done it.

01:28:51.493 --> 01:28:53.744
Now he acts like a prophet,
and you follow him.

01:28:53.829 --> 01:28:56.163
Did you hear what he said back there, Saul?

01:28:56.248 --> 01:29:00.084
Yes, I heard him.
We took an oath against Rome.

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:04.422
I don't see anything against Rome around here?
All I see are Jews against Jews.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.507
Then you're not listening.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:17.268
Lazarus.

01:29:18.854 --> 01:29:20.771
Lazarus!

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:39.248
How do you feel?

01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:44.545
I like the light.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:50.301
Well, what was it like?

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:56.057
Which is better, death or life?

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:00.269
I was a little surprised.

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:05.191
There wasn't that much difference.

01:30:12.574 --> 01:30:14.533
Give me your hand.

01:30:41.103 --> 01:30:43.979
I'm not surprised.
How could they let Lazarus live?

01:30:44.523 --> 01:30:47.358
He was proof of your greatest miracle.
Now he's gone. There's no more proof.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.735
That's what the Zealots want.

01:30:50.445 --> 01:30:52.905
Their revolution, not yours.

01:30:56.451 --> 01:30:59.453
- Do you want to go back to them?
- No.

01:30:59.538 --> 01:31:02.414
You're the one I follow.

01:31:04.251 --> 01:31:07.086
You are the strongest, aren't you?

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:13.300
Of all my friends,
you're the strongest.

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:18.931
Judas, my brother...

01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:23.394
I have something to tell you.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.775
I have a terrible secret from God.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:35.281
- You know why I came to Jerusalem?
- Yes.

01:31:35.949 --> 01:31:38.159
This is where the revolution's
going to begin.

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:42.830
Last night, Isaiah came to me.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:53.007
He had a prophecy.
I saw it written.

01:31:58.180 --> 01:32:00.139
It said...

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:04.351
"He has borne our faults;

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:08.147
he was wounded
for our transgressions...

01:32:08.231 --> 01:32:12.318
yet he opened not his mouth.

01:32:13.904 --> 01:32:16.280
Despised and rejected by all...

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:21.202
he went forward without resisting,
like a lamb led to the slaughter."

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.499
Mmm.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.130
I don't understand.

01:32:33.215 --> 01:32:35.674
Judas, I am the lamb.

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:39.053
- I'm the one who's going to die.
- Die?

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:44.099
- You mean you're not the Messiah?
- I am.

01:32:44.184 --> 01:32:46.977
That can't be. If you're the Messiah,
why do you have to die?

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:50.356
Listen. At first,
I didn't understand myself.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.733
No, you listen! Every day,
you have a different plan.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:56.779
First it's love, then it's the axe,
and now you have to die.

01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.697
- What good could that do?
- I can't help it.

01:32:58.782 --> 01:33:00.699
God only talks to me a little at a time.

01:33:00.784 --> 01:33:02.826
He only tells me as much
as I need to know.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:07.081
- We need you alive!
- Now I finally understand.

01:33:07.165 --> 01:33:11.335
All my life - All my life
I've been followed...

01:33:12.254 --> 01:33:13.837
by voices...

01:33:15.215 --> 01:33:18.467
by footsteps, by shadows.

01:33:18.551 --> 01:33:20.719
And do you know
what the shadow is?

01:33:22.806 --> 01:33:24.765
The cross.

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:29.603
I have to die on the cross,
and I have to die willingly.

01:33:35.568 --> 01:33:37.611
We have to go back to the temple.

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:42.283
And after you die on the cross,
what happens then?

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:47.246
I come back to judge
the living and the dead.

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.960
I don't believe you.

01:33:54.045 --> 01:33:56.005
You have to.

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:07.141
I'm worried he's gonna
change his mind again.

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:11.186
No, he won't. This time we're not
going to the temple to pray.

01:34:11.271 --> 01:34:14.732
He said he'll destroy the temple
in three days, and he'll do it.

01:34:14.816 --> 01:34:16.734
And what if he doesn't?

01:34:16.818 --> 01:34:19.069
- Then?
- What if he doesn't?

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:22.156
You won't have anything to worry about,
'cause we'll all be dead.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.616
We're setting up a new government.
We're building a new Jerusalem.

01:34:24.701 --> 01:34:28.245
We can ask for anything we want.
First, I'd like more sheep.

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:31.373
You know, my other sheep,
I don't even know where they are now.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:35.169
This time, I want a large herd, and I'll get
other shepherds to take care of 'em.

01:34:35.837 --> 01:34:38.964
I would just like to be able
to worship in the temple.

01:34:39.632 --> 01:34:44.470
I mean really worship...
without Roman banners and soldiers.

01:34:44.554 --> 01:34:48.182
- That's what I'd like.
- Of course. But what else?

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:51.935
I'll do anything the master asks.
Anything but get crucified.

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:55.939
- You're a coward, Thomas.
- Yes, I am. You know why?

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:58.650
You ever seen anybody hanging
on a cross after two days?

01:34:58.735 --> 01:35:01.820
You know what they look like?
They don't even have eyes.

01:35:01.905 --> 01:35:04.198
The crows come
and suck out your eyes.

01:35:04.282 --> 01:35:06.950
And after that, you know what?
Dogs come and rip your feet off.

01:35:07.035 --> 01:35:08.285
Don't talk that way.

01:35:08.370 --> 01:35:10.954
I've made my decision.
You make yours.

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.540
And if you can't, then get out now,
before we get to Jerusalem.

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.334
I'm ready.
I have my knife.

01:35:18.713 --> 01:35:23.967
Master, I've been talking with
the others and, uh, listening and -

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:27.388
Some of them wanted me
to ask you...

01:35:27.472 --> 01:35:29.515
will there be angels there
to meet us?

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:33.852
Or anyone besides who's here?

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:37.481
Master?

01:36:08.012 --> 01:36:10.431
King of the Jews!

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.934
King of the Jews!
King of the Jews!

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:13.160
King of the Jews!

01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:16.163
Jesus!
King of the Jews!

01:37:16.247 --> 01:37:18.332
- Jesus!

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:43.440
Lord, I hope this is what You want.

01:37:43.525 --> 01:37:48.946
Let me die here. Please let it
happen fast while I have the strength.

01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:53.408
Go! I'm here to set fire
to the world!

01:37:54.077 --> 01:37:59.331
In the desert, the Baptist
warned us God is coming!

01:37:59.415 --> 01:38:02.292
Well, I'm telling you it's too late.

01:38:02.377 --> 01:38:04.795
He's already here!

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.297
I'm here!

01:38:07.382 --> 01:38:12.052
And I'm going to baptize
everybody... with fire!

01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:40.747
He's leading us.
Follow him!

01:38:47.297 --> 01:38:49.881
They're all with you.
They're waiting for your signal. Give it.

01:38:49.966 --> 01:38:52.259
Now. Do it now.

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:04.563
Please. I'm waiting too.

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:07.899
Give me an axe, not the cross.
Let me die like this.

01:39:07.984 --> 01:39:10.527
If you don't give the sign now,
we're finished. They'll kill us for this.

01:39:10.612 --> 01:39:15.449
- We came to fight, not to die!
- Master, we knew it would be like this.

01:39:15.533 --> 01:39:18.118
This is the way. Do it.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:44.686
Judas, help me.

01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:49.274
Stay with me.

01:39:49.359 --> 01:39:51.610
Don't leave me.

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:09.855
I wish there was another way.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.984
I'm sorry, but there isn't.

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:17.738
I have to die on the cross.

01:41:18.322 --> 01:41:21.950
- I won't let you die.
- You have no choice. Neither do I.

01:41:22.869 --> 01:41:25.662
Remember, we're bringing
God and man together.

01:41:25.747 --> 01:41:29.666
They'll never be together unless I die.
I'm the sacrifice.

01:41:29.751 --> 01:41:33.336
Without you, there can be no redemption.
Forget everything else.

01:41:33.421 --> 01:41:36.506
- Understand that.
- No, I can't.

01:41:36.591 --> 01:41:38.675
Get somebody stronger.

01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.886
You promised me.

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.888
Remember, you once told me...

01:41:42.972 --> 01:41:46.183
that if I moved one step
from revolution, you'd kill me.

01:41:46.267 --> 01:41:47.768
Remember?

01:41:49.604 --> 01:41:53.231
- Yes.
- I've strayed, haven't I?

01:41:54.776 --> 01:41:55.859
Yes.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:58.695
Then you must keep your promise.
You have to kill me.

01:41:58.780 --> 01:42:01.823
If that's what God wants,
then let God do it. I won't.

01:42:01.908 --> 01:42:04.868
He will do it... through you.

01:42:07.163 --> 01:42:11.458
The temple guards will be looking for me
where there aren't any crowds.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:17.047
We'll go to Gethsemane.
You'll make sure that they find me there.

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:19.633
No.

01:42:20.635 --> 01:42:23.303
- I am going to die.

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:26.848
But after three days...

01:42:26.933 --> 01:42:30.435
I'll come back... in victory.

01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:34.773
You can't leave me.

01:42:34.857 --> 01:42:37.234
You have to give me strength.

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:40.654
If you were me,
could you betray your master?

01:42:41.739 --> 01:42:43.240
No.

01:42:45.535 --> 01:42:49.412
That's why God gave me
the easier job...

01:42:49.497 --> 01:42:51.998
to be crucified.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:40.130
What about the others?

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:43.675
I'll tell them tonight.

01:45:22.984 --> 01:45:24.943
Listen to me.

01:45:30.116 --> 01:45:32.325
Take this bread.

01:45:33.452 --> 01:45:35.996
Share it together.

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:40.291
This bread is my body.

01:46:22.251 --> 01:46:24.836
Now drink this wine.

01:46:26.172 --> 01:46:28.214
Pass the cup.

01:46:35.431 --> 01:46:37.891
This wine is my blood.

01:46:48.819 --> 01:46:51.613
Do this to remember me.

01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:14.946
- We're not finished.
- Let him go.

01:48:15.990 --> 01:48:17.949
All of you...

01:48:19.368 --> 01:48:22.495
I want to tell you something.

01:48:35.134 --> 01:48:37.510
Wait for me here.

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:03.411
Father in heaven.

01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:06.497
Father on Earth.

01:49:08.918 --> 01:49:11.169
The world...

01:49:11.253 --> 01:49:15.381
that You've created
that we can see is beautiful.

01:49:17.676 --> 01:49:22.680
But the world that You've created
that we can't see is beautiful too.

01:49:27.102 --> 01:49:31.731
I don't know. I'm sorry, Father.
I don't know which is more beautiful.

01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:48.748
This is my body too.

01:49:50.793 --> 01:49:53.628
Together...

01:49:53.712 --> 01:49:55.630
we're going to die.

01:49:57.258 --> 01:50:00.260
Oh, please, Father.

01:50:01.845 --> 01:50:04.764
I've been with You for so long.

01:50:05.849 --> 01:50:08.351
I never asked You to choose me.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.979
I always did as You said.

01:50:12.064 --> 01:50:15.400
You made many miracles for others.

01:50:16.277 --> 01:50:20.697
You opened the Red Sea for Moses.
You saved Noah.

01:50:20.781 --> 01:50:23.533
You took Elijah to heaven
in a fiery chariot...

01:50:23.617 --> 01:50:27.495
and now You're asking me
to be crucified.

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:33.584
Can I ask You...

01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:35.920
one last time?

01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:40.300
Do I have to die?

01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:45.263
Is there any other way?

01:50:47.016 --> 01:50:51.269
You're offering me a cup,
but I don't want to drink what's in it.

01:50:52.396 --> 01:50:55.648
Please, take it away.

01:50:55.733 --> 01:50:57.817
Please, stop.

01:50:57.901 --> 01:51:02.322
Please, Father, Father.

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:03.656
Please.

01:51:54.708 --> 01:51:57.335
Is this your answer?

01:52:17.481 --> 01:52:19.232
All right.

01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:22.860
Just please give me the strength.

01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:37.667
Couldn't you stay awake with me
for just an hour?

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:40.670
- I'm sorry.

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:46.509
It doesn't matter.

01:52:48.095 --> 01:52:50.638
- It's too late.

01:53:03.944 --> 01:53:05.820
Welcome, Rabbi.

01:53:15.664 --> 01:53:18.124
No. You live by this,
you die by it.

01:53:43.317 --> 01:53:45.318
Take me with you.

01:53:46.111 --> 01:53:48.154
I'm ready.

01:54:03.128 --> 01:54:06.130
So, you are the King of the Jews.

01:54:06.715 --> 01:54:08.841
"King" is your word.

01:54:10.177 --> 01:54:13.804
- Well, you are Jesus of Nazareth, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

01:54:13.889 --> 01:54:16.849
Well, that's what they're saying you are -
the King, the Messiah.

01:54:22.814 --> 01:54:25.775
It's also said that you do miracles.

01:54:25.859 --> 01:54:28.277
Is this good magic or bad magic?

01:54:30.197 --> 01:54:33.783
Could we have some kind
of a... demonstration?

01:54:35.285 --> 01:54:37.870
I mean, can you do a trick
for me now, say?

01:54:38.705 --> 01:54:39.872
No.

01:54:39.957 --> 01:54:43.376
I'm not a trained animal.
I'm not a magician.

01:54:43.460 --> 01:54:45.586
Well...

01:54:45.671 --> 01:54:47.588
that's disappointing.

01:54:50.717 --> 01:54:53.719
This means that you're
just another Jewish politician.

01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:04.480
Do you want to know something?

01:55:04.565 --> 01:55:07.692
You're more dangerous than the Zealots.
Do you know that?

01:55:14.658 --> 01:55:16.576
Say something.

01:55:20.414 --> 01:55:22.790
You had better say something.

01:55:27.588 --> 01:55:29.088
Alright.

01:55:30.465 --> 01:55:33.342
Tell me what you tell people
on the streets.

01:55:34.636 --> 01:55:36.470
Yes?

01:55:36.555 --> 01:55:38.306
Yes.

01:55:40.976 --> 01:55:44.270
The prophet Daniel had a vision.

01:55:44.354 --> 01:55:48.941
A tall statue had a gold head
and silver shoulders.

01:55:49.026 --> 01:55:53.904
The stomach was bronze,
the legs were iron, the feet were clay.

01:55:53.989 --> 01:55:55.906
A stone was thrown.

01:55:55.991 --> 01:55:59.994
The clay feet broke,
and the statue collapsed.

01:56:02.331 --> 01:56:03.998
Yes?

01:56:04.082 --> 01:56:08.336
You see, God threw the stone.
The stone's me, and Rome -

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:10.546
Rome is the statue, yes.

01:56:11.715 --> 01:56:14.675
So your kingdom, or your world...

01:56:14.760 --> 01:56:17.386
will replace Rome.

01:56:17.971 --> 01:56:20.848
- Where is it?
- My kingdom?

01:56:22.309 --> 01:56:24.310
It's not here.

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:26.312
Not on Earth.

01:56:27.731 --> 01:56:29.732
It wouldn't be, would it?

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:37.615
You know, it's one thing to want
to change the way that people live...

01:56:37.699 --> 01:56:41.118
but you want to change
how they think and how they feel.

01:56:41.203 --> 01:56:46.749
All I'm saying is that change
will happen with love, not with killing.

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.834
Either way, it's dangerous.

01:56:48.919 --> 01:56:52.463
It's against Rome.
It's against the way the world is.

01:56:52.547 --> 01:56:55.174
And killing or loving,
it's all the same.

01:56:55.258 --> 01:57:00.137
It simply doesn't matter how you want to
change things. We don't want them changed.

01:57:06.770 --> 01:57:09.355
You do understand
what has to happen.

01:57:10.774 --> 01:57:13.693
We have a space for you
up on Golgotha.

01:57:13.777 --> 01:57:17.613
Three thousand skulls there by now -
probably more.

01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.617
Guard.

01:57:26.248 --> 01:57:29.458
I do wish you people would go out
and count them sometime.

01:57:29.543 --> 01:57:31.460
Maybe you'd learn a lesson.

01:57:32.838 --> 01:57:36.132
No. Probably not.

01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:56.712
I know you!

01:58:56.797 --> 01:58:58.714
I saw you with him!

01:58:58.799 --> 01:59:02.051
You must be mistaken. It wasn't me.
It must've been someone else.

01:59:02.135 --> 01:59:05.054
No, I'm right.
He is one of his followers.

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:08.057
- He is one of his followers!
- He doesn't know what he's talking about!

01:59:08.141 --> 01:59:10.434
- He is one of his followers!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

01:59:10.519 --> 01:59:14.355
- It's him! Get him!

02:01:54.057 --> 02:01:55.975
Hold it there.

02:02:15.787 --> 02:02:19.748
Mother, Magdalene...

02:02:19.833 --> 02:02:21.792
where are you?

02:02:36.307 --> 02:02:39.727
Mother, I'm sorry
for being a bad son.

02:03:03.418 --> 02:03:05.753
Father, stay with me.
Don't leave me.

02:04:57.699 --> 02:05:01.118
Father, forgive them.

02:06:11.689 --> 02:06:13.815
Father!

02:06:14.525 --> 02:06:16.818
Why have You forsaken me?

02:07:18.381 --> 02:07:20.299
Who are you?

02:07:22.135 --> 02:07:24.303
I'm the angel who guards you.

02:07:29.642 --> 02:07:33.812
Your father is the God of mercy,
not punishment.

02:07:33.896 --> 02:07:35.814
He saw you and said...

02:07:35.898 --> 02:07:37.983
"Aren't you his guardian angel?

02:07:38.067 --> 02:07:41.278
Well, go down and save him.
He's suffered enough."

02:07:43.448 --> 02:07:46.700
Remember when He told Abraham
to sacrifice his son?

02:07:46.784 --> 02:07:51.204
Abraham was just about to kill the boy
with his knife when God stopped him.

02:07:51.706 --> 02:07:54.416
So if He saved Abraham's son...

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:56.877
don't you think He'd want
to save his own?

02:07:57.503 --> 02:08:00.589
He's tested you,
and He's happy with you.

02:08:00.673 --> 02:08:03.133
He doesn't want your blood.

02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:06.261
He said,
"Let him die in a dream...

02:08:06.346 --> 02:08:08.972
but let him live his life."

02:08:10.183 --> 02:08:12.601
All the pain.

02:08:12.685 --> 02:08:15.395
- That was real.
- Yes.

02:08:15.980 --> 02:08:17.898
But there won't be any more.

02:08:17.982 --> 02:08:19.900
You've done enough.

02:09:11.327 --> 02:09:13.745
I don't have to be sacrificed?

02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:16.415
No. No, you don't.

02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:20.877
I'm not the Messiah?

02:09:20.962 --> 02:09:23.380
No. No, you're not.

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:30.512
What about the others?

02:09:30.596 --> 02:09:32.514
Don't look back there.

02:09:32.598 --> 02:09:35.767
God gave you life.
Look ahead.

02:09:35.852 --> 02:09:37.769
Where are the disciples?

02:09:37.854 --> 02:09:40.272
They became frightened
and ran away.

02:09:46.571 --> 02:09:50.490
Is this the world of God,
the one I spoke about?

02:09:50.575 --> 02:09:52.909
No, this is Earth.

02:09:52.994 --> 02:09:57.497
- Why has it changed so much?
- It hasn't changed. You have.

02:09:57.582 --> 02:10:00.000
Now you can see its real beauty.

02:10:00.084 --> 02:10:04.629
Harmony between Earth and the heart -
that's the world of God.

02:10:04.714 --> 02:10:06.965
Maybe you'll find this
hard to believe...

02:10:07.049 --> 02:10:11.136
but sometimes we angels
look down on men and envy you.

02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:13.138
Really envy you.

02:10:39.832 --> 02:10:41.583
What's that?

02:10:41.667 --> 02:10:43.919
A wedding ceremony.

02:10:44.003 --> 02:10:46.171
Who's getting married?

02:10:46.756 --> 02:10:48.256
You are.

02:11:07.318 --> 02:11:09.236
What's wrong?

02:11:10.446 --> 02:11:12.364
Why are you crying?

02:11:14.283 --> 02:11:16.201
I'm thanking God...

02:11:17.995 --> 02:11:20.163
for bringing you here.

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.847
- We could have a child.
- Yes.

02:13:44.266 --> 02:13:46.685
Oh, we could have a child.

02:13:46.769 --> 02:13:48.144
Yes.

02:15:35.586 --> 02:15:37.504
Magdalene.

02:16:02.696 --> 02:16:04.656
Where are you going?

02:16:07.618 --> 02:16:12.163
Who are you going to kill, Jesus?
God? Are you going to kill God?

02:16:12.248 --> 02:16:16.000
Didn't you hear me, Jesus?
There is nothing you can do.

02:16:16.085 --> 02:16:18.169
God killed her!

02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.757
God's killed her.

02:16:40.942 --> 02:16:42.861
Oh, God!

02:16:54.582 --> 02:16:57.000
God took her away
when she was happy.

02:16:57.751 --> 02:16:59.502
Now she's immortal.

02:17:00.296 --> 02:17:03.548
She won't see her love die
or body decay.

02:17:04.758 --> 02:17:06.885
I was there the whole time
He was killing her...

02:17:06.968 --> 02:17:08.928
and I saw what happened.

02:17:10.138 --> 02:17:12.056
But it wasn't right.

02:17:13.726 --> 02:17:16.561
It wasn't right
for God to take her.

02:17:17.062 --> 02:17:20.147
You didn't complain
when God let you live.

02:17:20.232 --> 02:17:23.692
You can't complain now
because He let her die.

02:17:24.736 --> 02:17:26.529
Trust God's way.

02:17:28.031 --> 02:17:29.616
Listen.

02:17:29.700 --> 02:17:32.285
There's only one woman in the world.

02:17:33.077 --> 02:17:35.538
One woman with many faces.

02:17:36.373 --> 02:17:39.584
This one falls, the next one rises.

02:17:40.835 --> 02:17:42.962
Mary Magdalene died.

02:17:43.547 --> 02:17:46.758
But Mary, Lazarus's sister -

02:17:47.593 --> 02:17:49.093
she lives.

02:17:50.094 --> 02:17:53.056
She's Magdalene with a different face.

02:17:53.599 --> 02:17:56.768
She's carrying your greatest joy inside her.

02:17:57.311 --> 02:17:58.811
Your son.

02:17:59.355 --> 02:18:01.272
Come with me.

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:14.619
This is the way the Saviour comes.

02:18:15.663 --> 02:18:17.580
Gradually...

02:18:17.665 --> 02:18:19.832
from embrace to embrace...

02:18:19.916 --> 02:18:22.334
from son to son.

02:18:22.419 --> 02:18:24.837
This is the road.

02:18:30.302 --> 02:18:31.803
Mary.

02:18:32.429 --> 02:18:33.846
Look.

02:18:50.698 --> 02:18:53.574
Rabbi, I just want to see
if it's really you.

02:18:54.701 --> 02:18:56.619
He's real, like us.

02:18:56.704 --> 02:18:58.663
Don't you see?

02:19:00.457 --> 02:19:02.375
Come in.

02:19:02.459 --> 02:19:04.377
Come here.

02:19:09.633 --> 02:19:12.175
Master, I want to tell you one thing.

02:19:12.261 --> 02:19:14.679
I'm sorry about Magdalene.

02:19:14.763 --> 02:19:17.598
I won't ever leave you alone again.

02:19:17.683 --> 02:19:20.183
I'll always protect you.

02:19:21.311 --> 02:19:24.188
I don't want you to take
the wrong road and get lost again.

02:19:25.898 --> 02:19:29.402
Come inside.
I'll cook for you and your friend.

02:20:31.340 --> 02:20:33.758
Are you satisfied with me?

02:20:33.842 --> 02:20:36.427
Do you have any complaints?

02:20:36.512 --> 02:20:38.554
None.

02:20:46.188 --> 02:20:48.689
I'm ashamed when I think of it.

02:20:49.358 --> 02:20:50.858
Of what?

02:20:52.194 --> 02:20:54.987
Of all the mistakes I've made.

02:20:55.614 --> 02:20:59.117
Of all the wrong ways
I'd looked for God.

02:21:20.764 --> 02:21:22.306
Where's Mary?

02:21:22.391 --> 02:21:24.976
She won't be back till this evening.

02:21:26.645 --> 02:21:29.814
Come inside.
It's too hot out here.

02:21:39.199 --> 02:21:40.825
Come inside.

02:21:50.836 --> 02:21:53.254
There's only one woman in the world.

02:21:54.089 --> 02:21:55.756
Go inside.

02:22:06.894 --> 02:22:09.312
Well, we bought them -

02:22:09.396 --> 02:22:12.815
- Hey! What -
- You don't have to get involved.

02:22:12.900 --> 02:22:15.318
- Come on. Stay out of it.

02:22:15.402 --> 02:22:18.362
And I thought of stealing wheat.

02:22:19.156 --> 02:22:21.032
We are dying.

02:22:23.035 --> 02:22:24.952
So I intensified my efforts -

02:22:25.037 --> 02:22:27.955
- Here, watch your brother.

02:22:28.040 --> 02:22:31.042
Remember to thank God for the food,
and leave some for me.

02:22:31.126 --> 02:22:33.961
- I'll be back soon.
- Aren't you going to eat?

02:22:34.046 --> 02:22:36.881
- I want to hear what he's saying.
- You don't have to go there.

02:22:36.965 --> 02:22:39.884
I was one of the worst sinners.

02:22:39.968 --> 02:22:42.637
I lied, I stole, I cheated...

02:22:42.721 --> 02:22:45.306
I gambled, I whored, I drank...

02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:48.476
and persecuted, tortured and murdered.

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:50.561
Yes, murdered!

02:22:50.646 --> 02:22:54.398
I killed anyone
who broke the law of Moses...

02:22:54.483 --> 02:22:56.025
and I loved it.

02:22:56.109 --> 02:22:58.027
I enjoyed it. I relished it.

02:22:58.111 --> 02:22:59.987
I revelled in it.

02:23:00.072 --> 02:23:03.741
Because I thought
I was doing God's will!

02:23:03.825 --> 02:23:07.286
I thought I was doing God's will.

02:23:07.871 --> 02:23:10.790
And the high priest of Jerusalem
sent me to the city of Damascus...

02:23:10.874 --> 02:23:12.959
to scourge that city.

02:23:13.043 --> 02:23:17.296
And on the road to Damascus,
just outside the city, in the middle of the day...

02:23:17.381 --> 02:23:20.841
I was struck by a white light...

02:23:20.926 --> 02:23:23.719
that blinded me!

02:23:23.804 --> 02:23:24.804
Yes.

02:23:24.888 --> 02:23:27.890
And I heard a voice say...

02:23:27.975 --> 02:23:32.561
"Saul, why are you persecuting me?

02:23:32.646 --> 02:23:35.690
Why are you against me?"

02:23:35.774 --> 02:23:38.276
"Who are you?" I said.

02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:41.779
And the voice said, "Jesus."

02:23:42.864 --> 02:23:46.951
And he made me see.

02:23:47.452 --> 02:23:51.872
I was led helpless, like a child,
into a city that I was sent to scourge...

02:23:51.957 --> 02:23:54.375
and God sent me Ananias instead.

02:23:54.459 --> 02:23:57.878
And he put his hands on me,
and I opened my eyes...

02:23:57.963 --> 02:24:02.133
and I was baptized and became Paul.

02:24:02.801 --> 02:24:05.803
And now I bring the good news to you.

02:24:05.887 --> 02:24:08.055
And it's about Jesus of Nazareth.

02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:12.310
He was not the son of Mary.
He was the Son of God!

02:24:12.394 --> 02:24:14.186
His mother was a virgin.

02:24:14.271 --> 02:24:18.899
And the Angel Gabriel came down
and put God's seed in her womb.

02:24:18.984 --> 02:24:21.235
That's how he was born.

02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:24.238
And he was punished for our sins.

02:24:24.323 --> 02:24:26.240
Our sins!

02:24:26.325 --> 02:24:29.744
Then he was tortured and crucified!

02:24:30.537 --> 02:24:32.830
But three days later...

02:24:32.914 --> 02:24:37.918
he rose up from the dead
and went up to heaven.

02:24:38.003 --> 02:24:40.421
Death was conquered.

02:24:40.505 --> 02:24:42.465
Amen.

02:24:43.050 --> 02:24:45.468
Do you understand what that means?

02:24:45.552 --> 02:24:47.762
He conquered death!

02:24:48.638 --> 02:24:51.682
All of our sins were forgiven...

02:24:52.225 --> 02:24:55.936
and now the world of God
is open to every one of us...

02:24:56.021 --> 02:24:57.938
to everybody!

02:24:58.023 --> 02:25:03.319
Did you ever see this Jesus of Nazareth
after he came back from the dead?

02:25:03.403 --> 02:25:05.321
I mean, with your own eyes?

02:25:05.405 --> 02:25:09.784
No, but I saw a light that blinded me,
and I heard his voice.

02:25:09.868 --> 02:25:12.036
- You're a liar.
- His disciples saw him.

02:25:12.788 --> 02:25:15.081
They were hiding in an attic
with the doors locked...

02:25:15.165 --> 02:25:16.791
and he appeared to them.

02:25:16.875 --> 02:25:19.210
Liar. He's a liar.

02:25:27.135 --> 02:25:28.969
Wait a minute.

02:25:29.054 --> 02:25:31.055
Wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

02:25:31.139 --> 02:25:33.307
I was never crucified.
I never came back from the dead.

02:25:33.392 --> 02:25:36.018
- I'm a man, like everybody else.
- Quiet!

02:25:36.103 --> 02:25:38.938
- Why are you telling these lies?
- What are you talking about?

02:25:39.022 --> 02:25:41.440
I'm the son of Mary and Joseph.

02:25:41.525 --> 02:25:43.442
I'm the one who preached in Galilee.

02:25:43.527 --> 02:25:45.986
I had followers.
We marched on Jerusalem.

02:25:46.071 --> 02:25:50.699
- Pilate condemned me, and God saved me.
- No, He didn't.

02:25:50.784 --> 02:25:52.535
Who are you talking about?

02:25:52.619 --> 02:25:56.080
Don't try and tell me
what happened to me, because I know.

02:25:56.164 --> 02:25:59.875
I live like a man now.
I work, eat, have children.

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:02.753
I enjoy my life.
For the first time, I'm enjoying it.

02:26:02.838 --> 02:26:04.755
Do you understand what I'm saying?

02:26:04.840 --> 02:26:08.884
So don't go around telling lies about me,
or I'll tell everybody the truth!

02:26:10.053 --> 02:26:12.972
Just a minute.
What's the matter with you?

02:26:13.056 --> 02:26:15.975
Look around you.
Look at all these people.

02:26:16.059 --> 02:26:17.977
Look at their faces.

02:26:18.061 --> 02:26:21.981
Do you see how unhappy they are?
Do you see how much they're suffering?

02:26:22.524 --> 02:26:26.152
Their only hope is the resurrected Jesus.

02:26:26.236 --> 02:26:28.696
I don't care whether you're Jesus or not.

02:26:28.780 --> 02:26:31.782
The resurrected Jesus will save the world,
and that's what matters.

02:26:31.867 --> 02:26:34.869
Those are lies.
You can't save the world by lying.

02:26:34.953 --> 02:26:39.373
I created the truth out of what people
needed and what they believed.

02:26:39.458 --> 02:26:42.418
If I have to crucify you to save
the world, then I'll crucify you.

02:26:42.502 --> 02:26:46.046
And if I have to resurrect you,
then I'll do that too, whether you like it or not.

02:26:46.131 --> 02:26:49.550
- I won't let you. I'll tell everyone the truth.

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:53.512
Go ahead. Go on.
Tell them now.

02:26:53.597 --> 02:26:55.806
Who's going to believe you?

02:26:55.891 --> 02:26:58.142
You started all this.
Now you can't stop it.

02:26:58.226 --> 02:27:00.603
All those people who believe me
will grab you and kill you.

02:27:00.687 --> 02:27:03.814
- No, that wouldn't happen.
- How do you know?

02:27:05.233 --> 02:27:08.569
You see, you don't know
how much people need God.

02:27:09.154 --> 02:27:11.780
You don't know how happy
He can make them.

02:27:11.865 --> 02:27:13.574
He can make them happy
to do anything.

02:27:13.658 --> 02:27:17.119
He can make them happy to die,
and they'll die.

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:20.164
All for the sake of Christ.

02:27:20.749 --> 02:27:23.000
Jesus Christ.

02:27:23.084 --> 02:27:26.086
Jesus of Nazareth.
The Son of God.

02:27:26.171 --> 02:27:27.671
The Messiah.

02:27:28.757 --> 02:27:32.426
Not you.
Not for your sake.

02:27:34.095 --> 02:27:36.388
You know, I'm glad I met you...

02:27:36.473 --> 02:27:39.308
because now I can forget
all about you.

02:27:39.392 --> 02:27:43.479
My Jesus is much more important
and much more powerful.

02:27:44.856 --> 02:27:48.359
Thank you.
It's a good thing I met you.

02:28:23.395 --> 02:28:25.229
Don't ever leave me.

02:28:28.900 --> 02:28:30.651
I'm happy here.

02:28:49.921 --> 02:28:54.258
I remember when Mary and I
planted these vines.

02:29:00.473 --> 02:29:02.600
You know, this will all pass.

02:29:05.478 --> 02:29:07.229
Why?

02:29:07.981 --> 02:29:09.940
Are you leaving me?

02:29:12.444 --> 02:29:14.403
We have to move on.

02:29:17.824 --> 02:29:19.783
You've grown old.

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:24.038
You've done well.

02:29:27.125 --> 02:29:29.376
We've both done well.

02:29:35.675 --> 02:29:38.427
Get inside! Get inside!
They're killing everyone!

02:29:38.511 --> 02:29:40.429
Jerusalem is on fire!
It's burning!

02:29:40.513 --> 02:29:43.432
The Romans are killing everyone!
They're killing everyone!

02:30:41.199 --> 02:30:43.158
Get out of the way.
We were sent here.

02:30:57.340 --> 02:31:00.050
God told us you would
show yourself to us.

02:31:03.680 --> 02:31:05.931
Said you were dying.

02:31:07.809 --> 02:31:10.144
Peter, is that you?

02:31:12.313 --> 02:31:14.898
I can't tell.

02:31:16.943 --> 02:31:18.902
What happened to you?

02:31:20.822 --> 02:31:22.531
I got old.

02:31:23.283 --> 02:31:24.825
You got old.

02:31:27.328 --> 02:31:29.747
Oh, this one I know.

02:31:30.999 --> 02:31:34.918
No matter how old you get,
I know you, Nathaniel.

02:31:37.881 --> 02:31:41.508
You were the best shepherd,
because you had no sheep.

02:31:41.593 --> 02:31:43.385
Oh, Rabbi.

02:31:45.221 --> 02:31:47.014
I missed you.

02:31:48.475 --> 02:31:50.434
And you?

02:31:52.771 --> 02:31:54.772
They cut you.

02:31:55.857 --> 02:31:58.108
Your face.

02:31:58.193 --> 02:32:00.235
- Who are you?
- Rabbi.

02:32:01.613 --> 02:32:03.280
John.

02:32:04.407 --> 02:32:06.325
The Romans tortured me.

02:32:06.409 --> 02:32:08.452
They cut my face.

02:32:09.037 --> 02:32:11.663
I tried to tell them all about you.

02:32:13.124 --> 02:32:15.501
Then I saw Jerusalem burn.

02:32:17.462 --> 02:32:21.548
I even saw the Ark of the Covenant
stolen from the temple.

02:32:21.633 --> 02:32:25.469
They destroyed the temple,
just like you said.

02:32:26.346 --> 02:32:27.846
The Ark?

02:32:29.057 --> 02:32:31.725
There's someone else outside.

02:32:31.810 --> 02:32:34.269
Be careful. He's still angry.

02:32:40.151 --> 02:32:41.819
Judas.

02:32:43.905 --> 02:32:47.157
Judas, come in.

02:32:48.993 --> 02:32:50.786
Didn't you hear me?

02:32:53.498 --> 02:32:57.459
Oh, I missed you so much.

02:32:58.086 --> 02:33:00.295
He hears you.
He just won't say anything.

02:33:00.839 --> 02:33:03.423
He's been fighting in Jerusalem.

02:33:03.508 --> 02:33:05.259
Look at his hands.

02:33:05.343 --> 02:33:07.302
There's still blood on them.

02:33:09.222 --> 02:33:12.057
Judas, the master is speaking to you.
Answer him.

02:33:13.601 --> 02:33:15.102
Traitor!

02:33:25.905 --> 02:33:28.282
Your place was on the cross.

02:33:29.117 --> 02:33:31.535
That's where God put you.

02:33:31.619 --> 02:33:35.330
When death got too close,
you got scared and you ran away...

02:33:35.415 --> 02:33:38.333
and hid yourself
in the life of some man.

02:33:38.418 --> 02:33:41.128
We did what we were
supposed to do. You didn't.

02:33:41.838 --> 02:33:43.630
You're a coward!

02:33:43.715 --> 02:33:46.842
- Don't you have any respect?
- For him?

02:33:47.719 --> 02:33:49.761
You don't understand.

02:33:49.846 --> 02:33:51.680
Understand?

02:33:53.725 --> 02:33:55.642
Rabbi.

02:33:57.896 --> 02:33:59.980
You broke my heart.

02:34:01.482 --> 02:34:04.067
Sometimes I curse the day
I ever met you.

02:34:07.864 --> 02:34:10.532
We held the world in our hands.

02:34:11.576 --> 02:34:13.535
Remember what you told me?

02:34:14.579 --> 02:34:16.747
You took me in your arms -

02:34:18.416 --> 02:34:20.500
Do you remember?

02:34:20.585 --> 02:34:23.754
And you begged me,
"Betray me. Betray me.

02:34:23.838 --> 02:34:25.923
I have to be crucified.

02:34:26.007 --> 02:34:30.177
I have to be resurrected
so I can save the world.

02:34:30.261 --> 02:34:33.180
I am the lamb," you said.

02:34:33.264 --> 02:34:35.974
"Death is the door.

02:34:36.059 --> 02:34:40.771
Judas, my brother, don't be afraid.
Help me go through the door."

02:34:42.190 --> 02:34:45.400
And I loved you so much...

02:34:45.485 --> 02:34:47.402
I went and betrayed you.

02:34:49.489 --> 02:34:51.448
And you -

02:34:54.786 --> 02:34:56.078
You -

02:34:59.165 --> 02:35:01.500
What are you doing here?

02:35:01.584 --> 02:35:06.213
What business do you have here
with women, with children?

02:35:06.297 --> 02:35:09.007
What's good for a man
isn't good for God.

02:35:09.092 --> 02:35:11.093
Why weren't you crucified?

02:35:16.265 --> 02:35:19.142
Look at his wounds, Judas.
They're bleeding.

02:35:19.811 --> 02:35:21.895
You're hurting him.
That's enough.

02:35:21.980 --> 02:35:24.606
He was going to be the New Covenant.

02:35:24.691 --> 02:35:27.150
- Now there's no more Israel.
- No.

02:35:28.194 --> 02:35:31.154
No. You don't understand.

02:35:33.324 --> 02:35:36.326
The guardian angel.

02:35:38.162 --> 02:35:41.415
God sent the guardian angel to save me.

02:35:41.499 --> 02:35:44.918
Angel? What angel?

02:35:45.003 --> 02:35:46.670
Look at her.

02:35:52.468 --> 02:35:54.386
Satan.

02:35:57.932 --> 02:36:01.059
I told you we would meet again.

02:36:05.314 --> 02:36:07.816
If you die this way, you die like a man.

02:36:07.900 --> 02:36:10.527
You turn against God, your father.

02:36:10.611 --> 02:36:15.365
- There's no sacrifice. There's no salvation.

02:36:33.968 --> 02:36:36.219
There's nothing you can do.

02:36:37.889 --> 02:36:40.057
You lived this life.

02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:42.559
You accepted it.

02:36:44.020 --> 02:36:45.562
It's over.

02:36:46.689 --> 02:36:49.941
Just finish it. Die.

02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:53.278
Die like a man.

02:37:25.061 --> 02:37:26.603
Father.

02:37:28.940 --> 02:37:31.108
Will You listen to me?

02:37:33.694 --> 02:37:35.612
Are You still there?

02:37:37.448 --> 02:37:42.119
Will You listen to a selfish
and unfaithful son?

02:37:44.872 --> 02:37:48.333
I fought You when You called.
I resisted.

02:37:48.417 --> 02:37:51.711
I thought I knew more.
I didn't want to be Your son.

02:37:51.796 --> 02:37:54.047
Can You forgive me?

02:37:54.132 --> 02:37:57.008
I didn't fight hard enough.

02:37:57.802 --> 02:38:00.220
Father...

02:38:00.304 --> 02:38:02.305
give me Your hand.

02:38:02.974 --> 02:38:05.058
I want to bring salvation!

02:38:05.143 --> 02:38:07.811
Father, take me back!

02:38:07.895 --> 02:38:10.313
Make a feast!
Welcome me home!

02:38:10.398 --> 02:38:14.401
I want to be Your son!
I want to pay the price!

02:38:14.485 --> 02:38:17.487
I want to be crucified
and rise again!

02:38:17.572 --> 02:38:20.490
I want to be the Messiah!

02:39:07.371 --> 02:39:09.873
It is accomplished!

02:39:19.258 --> 02:39:21.551
It is accomplished.
