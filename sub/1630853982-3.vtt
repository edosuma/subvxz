WEBVTT

00:16.867 --> 00:18.604
Come on, bud.

00:18.671 --> 00:20.708
You don't slither into Delaware
from the Plorble Realm

00:20.775 --> 00:22.679
to hang out in the Hamboni's
parking lot, okay?

00:24.248 --> 00:26.085
Why are you here?
What's your plan?

00:27.488 --> 00:29.191
More? Okay.

00:31.062 --> 00:32.632
Spit it out,
you goblin fuck.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.570
Ladies' night!

00:34.636 --> 00:36.674
I'm finally getting you
out of the house

00:36.740 --> 00:38.276
and into The Coconut Hole--

00:38.343 --> 00:41.316
frozen fireballs served by
bulging hunks in tight shorts.

00:41.382 --> 00:42.786
Yeah, change of plans, Darlene.

00:42.852 --> 00:44.288
I got my hands full right now.

00:44.355 --> 00:45.758
Bastards like this
keep showing up.

00:45.825 --> 00:47.494
I think they're drawn
to Chrissy or something.

00:47.562 --> 00:49.498
Uh-uh, no more living like
you're in witness protection.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.202
You promised
tonight's the night.

00:51.269 --> 00:52.639
Chrissy's at her dad's
for the weekend.

00:52.706 --> 00:54.475
Which means I actually have
a night to myself,

00:54.543 --> 00:56.312
and I'd rather not
spend it surrounded by

00:56.379 --> 00:57.916
spray-tanned lemmings
drinking daiquiris

00:57.983 --> 00:59.352
until their Cialis kicks in.

00:59.418 --> 01:00.420
Listen, I get it.

01:00.487 --> 01:01.924
After my first marriage ended,

01:01.991 --> 01:03.426
I was terrified to get back
out there, leave the house.

01:03.493 --> 01:05.531
I'm not scared.
I have a routine and I like it.

01:05.598 --> 01:07.669
I'd make up excuses:
"Gotta fix a leaky pipe."

01:07.736 --> 01:09.372
"I have syphilis."
- This is not an excuse.

01:09.438 --> 01:10.909
I don't have time
to dick around with dicks.

01:10.975 --> 01:12.278
But then Tia Saltzman

01:12.344 --> 01:13.814
forced me
out onto the dance floor,

01:13.881 --> 01:16.654
and a phoenix Darlene
rose from the goddamn ashes.

01:16.720 --> 01:19.593
Aah! I'll go out if you just
stop talking, okay, Darlene?

01:19.660 --> 01:21.262
Yes!
- You, don't get cozy.

01:21.329 --> 01:22.666
I'm coming back for your ass.

01:22.732 --> 01:24.736
Okay, one drink, though.
- Watch out, Middletown.

01:24.803 --> 01:27.408
It's Laura and Darlene's
big night out!

01:27.474 --> 01:28.577
Title sequence.

01:35.558 --> 01:37.595
And then at 10:00 p. m.,
they sound a bullhorn,

01:37.662 --> 01:39.332
and the first one
up the tiki pole

01:39.398 --> 01:41.837
gets a bowl of Everclear
poured in their mouth.

01:41.904 --> 01:43.073
Aren't you glad you came out?

01:43.139 --> 01:44.208
There are two separate men

01:44.275 --> 01:46.412
masturbating
in two separate corners.

01:46.479 --> 01:49.051
Ooh, cutie at five o'clock.
Hot tip: take his compliment.

01:49.118 --> 01:52.959
Then tease with a spicy
little secret about yourself.

01:53.026 --> 01:55.263
Hi. Your soul is gorgeous.

01:55.330 --> 01:56.767
Thank you.

01:56.834 --> 01:58.771
You should see the scar
from the vaginal tear I had

01:58.838 --> 01:59.873
when birthing my daughter.

02:01.309 --> 02:02.979
Jeez, that was
some sweet meat you just burnt.

02:03.046 --> 02:04.716
Maybe put some sugar
in it next time.

02:04.783 --> 02:06.419
There won't be a next time.
I'm out.

02:06.486 --> 02:08.557
What? we just got here.

02:08.624 --> 02:10.360
I did what you asked
and what I told you I'd do.

02:10.427 --> 02:12.364
If I stay any longer,
I will kill someone.

02:12.431 --> 02:13.567
But you haven't even seen

02:13.634 --> 02:14.736
the Kahlúa Crab Canoe yet.

02:14.803 --> 02:16.239
Yeah, close me out
before I repaint

02:16.306 --> 02:17.742
the bathroom walls
with my brain.

02:17.809 --> 02:19.946
Hurry it up, asshole.
Need the fuck outta here.

02:20.013 --> 02:21.550
Surely someone
with your disposition

02:21.617 --> 02:23.320
would know a place
with a motto

02:23.386 --> 02:25.858
"Have a Hula-va good time"
would be a living disease.

02:25.925 --> 02:27.529
And surely you're perceptive
enough to know

02:27.595 --> 02:29.398
hitting on me is a dead end.

02:29.465 --> 02:31.469
I'm here merely
as a social observer,

02:31.537 --> 02:33.574
soaking in the waning
sexual rhythms

02:33.641 --> 02:36.079
of these septuagenarians
for my latest novella.

02:36.145 --> 02:37.716
Uh-huh.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.619
So how long have you been
a serial killer?

02:39.686 --> 02:41.456
I'm--what?

02:41.523 --> 02:42.659
The fishing line marks
on your hands,

02:42.726 --> 02:44.328
binocular indents
around your eyes,

02:44.395 --> 02:46.366
minor abrasions
on your forearm and cheekbone.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.169
Last one put up a fight?

02:48.236 --> 02:49.873
And either you're Forrest Gump, or...

02:49.940 --> 02:54.382
Ooh, yup, that's a billy club.

02:54.448 --> 02:56.319
Two Marys, extra bloody.

02:56.386 --> 02:57.756
Who are you?

02:57.822 --> 03:01.062
I'm just a single girl
looking for a fun night out.

03:01.129 --> 03:03.534
Let me get that.
- No, no, it's on me.

03:06.239 --> 03:07.675
Okay.

03:07.742 --> 03:08.744
Ketamine, really?

03:08.811 --> 03:11.215
You trying to murder me
or disappoint me?

03:11.282 --> 03:12.752
Mama's got the antidote, though.

03:14.388 --> 03:16.459
Dog piss aftertaste...
tromaxadam?

03:16.527 --> 03:18.931
Who are you, my psychiatrist?

03:18.998 --> 03:21.469
What's more obvious
is the needle up your sleeve.

03:21.537 --> 03:23.874
You'll never stick me
before I fry your balls.

03:25.477 --> 03:27.816
- Everett.
- Laura. Tell you what.

03:27.882 --> 03:30.420
I'll let you stab me once
to stroke your ego.

03:30.487 --> 03:32.892
A single thrust
is all I'll need.

03:52.699 --> 03:54.736
In fact,
we can start right now.

03:54.803 --> 03:56.105
What a production!

03:56.172 --> 03:58.443
Maximus Dawnus, here we come!

03:58.511 --> 04:00.113
I love you, Dad.

04:00.180 --> 04:01.683
Boo!

04:01.750 --> 04:02.886
Excuse me.
Pardon me, pardon me.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.221
Hey, cabbie!

04:04.288 --> 04:05.357
- Get out of the way!

04:05.424 --> 04:06.960
- I thought you were into it.
- Really?

04:07.027 --> 04:09.365
You thought I'd be into
a puppet propaganda show

04:09.432 --> 04:10.968
all about signing your pact?

04:11.035 --> 04:13.072
You got me there.
Playwright lacked subtlety.

04:13.139 --> 04:14.375
I'm going home.

04:14.442 --> 04:15.745
Home?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't go.

04:15.812 --> 04:17.582
I wanted to spend
quality time with you,

04:17.649 --> 04:19.820
but obviously
that's impossible, so...

04:19.886 --> 04:22.057
- Aw, come on.
- Yeah, I have friends to see,

04:22.124 --> 04:23.193
homework to do,

04:23.259 --> 04:24.328
Great British Bake Off
to binge.

04:24.395 --> 04:25.698
Give me one more shot.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.535
You think this was all
I had planned today?

04:27.602 --> 04:30.575
Oh, no, I got a whole afternoon
mapped out.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.879
You're gonna crap your pants,
you're gonna love it so much.

04:32.946 --> 04:34.950
Come on, baby.

04:38.557 --> 04:40.026
Smaller than I imagined.

04:40.093 --> 04:42.097
I wanna make you wet
with your own blood.

04:42.164 --> 04:46.005
I'm gonna open you up and see
how hard your bones are.

04:46.072 --> 04:48.476
Laura? You decided to stay!

04:48.544 --> 04:50.347
You and your cutie
wanna head to 'Rokey in a bit?

04:50.413 --> 04:52.417
Let's take this
someplace private.

04:52.484 --> 04:53.654
Oh, getting right to it. Okay.

04:53.721 --> 04:55.625
Kind of a 180,
but do your thing, girl.

04:55.691 --> 04:57.161
Get that big old bass.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.435
Nice and tight.

05:01.503 --> 05:03.373
I've been pulled tighter.

05:07.247 --> 05:08.951
I know we just met, but...

05:10.053 --> 05:11.957
What do you say
we go all the way?

05:12.024 --> 05:14.963
Wow, and that's just
the tip, huh?

05:18.737 --> 05:20.641
Oh, my God, I killed a man.

05:20.708 --> 05:22.110
Darlene, why did you do that?

05:22.177 --> 05:24.649
Well, I was saving you
Single White Female style.

05:24.716 --> 05:26.787
I wasn't in trouble.
I was totally fine.

05:26.854 --> 05:28.724
I was doing a thing.
- Thing? What kind of thing?

05:28.791 --> 05:30.460
He was about to chop you up.

05:30.528 --> 05:31.964
Yeah, that's what
serial killers do,

05:32.030 --> 05:33.734
but I was gonna kill him eventually.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.370
I brought you out
to get you away

05:35.437 --> 05:37.909
from torturing monsters
in dark garages.

05:37.976 --> 05:40.548
And here you are in a dark
alley with another monster?

05:40.615 --> 05:42.317
Oh, you're one to judge.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.754
You lure innocent
Instacart shoppers

05:43.821 --> 05:45.591
into your house
with candy and cheese plates.

05:45.658 --> 05:47.427
How I please
those Instacart shoppers

05:47.494 --> 05:48.831
is a gift
for everyone involved,

05:48.898 --> 05:51.335
and I want you to experience
that fun in your life.

05:51.402 --> 05:54.543
No offense, Darlene, but you
don't know what I need, okay?

05:56.479 --> 05:58.851
Okay, I'm actually great at
picking up on what people need.

05:58.918 --> 06:00.053
I'm an Aries.

06:00.120 --> 06:02.024
Well, I need you
to guard the entrance

06:02.090 --> 06:04.061
so I can clean up this mess
and head home.

06:04.128 --> 06:05.497
Stay here, and don't move.

06:08.236 --> 06:09.606
Laur, I'm gonna be blunt.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.042
I've read enough Brené Brown

06:11.108 --> 06:13.346
to spot a self-saboteur
when I see one.

06:13.413 --> 06:14.649
Darlene, what the hell?

06:14.716 --> 06:16.185
I told you to watch the door.

06:16.252 --> 06:17.522
Liquesco is a fragile

06:17.589 --> 06:19.659
and extremely powerful
compound, okay?

06:19.726 --> 06:21.630
It can open fissures
to hidden corners of the Earth,

06:21.697 --> 06:23.233
but if any type
of liquid touches it--

06:23.299 --> 06:25.771
This looks like
as good a place as any

06:25.838 --> 06:27.040
to urinate.

06:29.178 --> 06:30.748
No! Motherfu--

06:33.052 --> 06:34.556
Ew. Ugh.

06:34.623 --> 06:35.725
How much longer
is this gonna be?

06:35.791 --> 06:36.893
You couldn't have just, like,

06:36.960 --> 06:38.564
blammo'd to us
to wherever we're going?

06:38.631 --> 06:40.433
You'd think they'd have
a better system by now,

06:40.501 --> 06:42.137
but the only way to travel
to other realms

06:42.204 --> 06:44.876
on this plane of existence
is public transportation.

06:44.943 --> 06:46.412
We're going to another realm?

06:46.479 --> 06:48.884
The Metaphysical Realm
is just one of a shit ton

06:48.951 --> 06:51.088
across the Demicorporeal Plane.

06:51.155 --> 06:53.426
Imagine this whole place
as a shopping mall

06:53.493 --> 06:55.998
and the realms
are like the stores in it.

06:56.065 --> 06:58.169
<i>The one we're going to
is like Hot Topic</i>

06:58.236 --> 07:00.273
<i>but with fornication
and genocide.</i>

07:00.340 --> 07:02.244
<i>
Next stop: Wibby Turkle Realm.</i>

07:02.311 --> 07:03.814
<i>Wibby Turkle, next stop.</i>

07:07.822 --> 07:10.695
I used to come here when
it was a genuine piece of shit.

07:10.761 --> 07:11.997
Now it's a tourist trap.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.769
Get your Choochie tchotchkes.
Don't worry.

07:14.836 --> 07:16.372
I got us the VIP treatment.

07:16.439 --> 07:17.374
Welcome.

07:21.449 --> 07:22.351
Mmm.

07:22.417 --> 07:23.386
Ugh!

07:23.453 --> 07:25.390
Ooh!

07:25.457 --> 07:27.094
Whoa, do I get to keep this?

07:27.160 --> 07:28.530
I weirdly like it.

07:28.597 --> 07:29.899
You wanna give me a hint
of what we're doing here?

07:29.966 --> 07:32.237
Let's just say
it's not a puppet show.

07:33.907 --> 07:35.878
<i>Welcome once again</i>

07:35.945 --> 07:38.951
<i>to the number one game show
in all the realms,</i>

07:39.018 --> 07:42.825
<i>the only show that killing
is legally required:</i>

07:42.892 --> 07:45.497
the Realm of Realms,

07:45.564 --> 07:48.169
presented by Roach Automobiles.

07:48.236 --> 07:49.806
What did you get us into?

07:49.873 --> 07:51.342
You wanted you and me time.

07:51.409 --> 07:53.981
No, like lunch or something,
not kill or be killed.

07:54.048 --> 07:56.419
Chillax, we're not gonna bond
over a sandwich.

07:56.485 --> 07:57.722
Trust me on this one.

07:57.789 --> 08:00.260
<i>And now your outstanding host</i>

08:00.327 --> 08:04.034
<i>and executive producer
of everything Wibby Turkle,</i>

08:04.101 --> 08:07.040
<i>the ruler who will fuck,
marry, and kill you,</i>

08:07.107 --> 08:11.349
<i>the one and only
Queen Inichoochiama!</i>

08:11.415 --> 08:13.019
Choochie, Choochie,

08:13.086 --> 08:14.756
Choochie, Choochie!

08:16.860 --> 08:19.131
Hello, hello, hello,

08:19.198 --> 08:21.536
all of my stupid-ass
Choochie babies.

08:21.603 --> 08:23.206
Can I ask you something?

08:23.272 --> 08:24.809
Yes, you can!

08:24.876 --> 08:27.314
What do you want more than
anything in all the realms?

08:27.381 --> 08:28.751
We wanna fuck a corpse.

08:28.817 --> 08:30.387
I can't hear you.

08:30.453 --> 08:32.024
We wanna fuck a corpse!

08:33.226 --> 08:35.831
I've got a heck of a show
for you tonight, babies.

08:35.898 --> 08:38.036
We have two
very special vermin.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.973
Once an exterminator
on our show,

08:40.040 --> 08:42.678
the baddest boy in town,
and one of my faves,

08:42.745 --> 08:44.516
welcome Satan.

08:47.254 --> 08:48.757
How you doin', Chooch?

08:48.824 --> 08:49.859
Well, now that you're here,

08:49.926 --> 08:50.895
I'd be lying
if I didn't say wet.

08:50.961 --> 08:53.199
- Eww!
- And he's joined

08:53.266 --> 08:55.705
by his adorable
half-human daughter,

08:55.771 --> 08:57.374
Cringey Christ.

08:57.441 --> 09:00.013
It's Chrissy! And Feinberg.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.950
They'll be facing off
against our exterminators,

09:02.017 --> 09:04.388
the most powerful
and sociopathic creatures

09:04.455 --> 09:06.258
from all corners of the realms.

09:06.325 --> 09:10.534
Will our vermin survive,
or will they go bye-bye?

09:11.803 --> 09:14.843
Let the games begin!

09:21.355 --> 09:23.994
Ugh! What is this,
an open mic night?

09:24.061 --> 09:26.633
The queen produces the most
craven torture chambers.

09:26.700 --> 09:27.969
Ah, she's amazing.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.606
Anyone got earplugs?
I hate this song.

09:30.875 --> 09:32.745
Up next is the improv troupe

09:32.812 --> 09:35.383
The Whoopee Cushions,
doing a six-hour set.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.722
Holy shit, this is awful.

09:37.789 --> 09:39.993
Can we get a song lyric
from the audience?

09:46.338 --> 09:48.844
And... scene.

09:48.911 --> 09:50.848
<i>Here comes Typhon.</i>

09:50.915 --> 09:53.921
<i>Remember, if it bleeds,
he can kill it.</i>

09:53.987 --> 09:56.392
If you think a death match
is how I wanna bond,

09:56.459 --> 09:57.829
you really don't
know me at all.

09:57.895 --> 09:59.599
Your human conditioning
has kept you

09:59.666 --> 10:01.235
from tapping into the real you.

10:01.302 --> 10:02.237
This will help you let go.

10:02.304 --> 10:04.642
No, this is
child endangerment.

10:04.709 --> 10:05.811
You messed up, Dad.

10:05.878 --> 10:07.782
You're with an all-powerful
being, honey.

10:07.849 --> 10:10.153
Don't worry.
Trust your instincts.

10:10.220 --> 10:12.658
<i>Check, please.</i>

10:12.725 --> 10:14.829
<i>Don't forget
to rip your bartender.</i>

10:14.896 --> 10:17.902
What? This is your best move
as an all-powerful being?

10:17.969 --> 10:19.739
Suck my ass, old man!

10:21.275 --> 10:22.945
<i>
Someone get a breath mint.</i>

10:24.448 --> 10:25.684
Whoa!

10:25.751 --> 10:28.156
See, endangerment
has its benefits.

10:38.142 --> 10:40.213
Daddy-daughter killing time.

10:40.280 --> 10:43.219
- That wasn't so bad.
- Only 23 to go.

10:43.286 --> 10:45.758
23? Okay, fine.

10:45.825 --> 10:47.227
Let's do it.

10:47.294 --> 10:48.931
You son of a...

10:48.997 --> 10:50.366
biiiitch!

10:52.337 --> 10:55.210
So is this, like, your,
uh, home away from home?

10:55.276 --> 10:56.980
These are hidden pockets
on Earth

10:57.047 --> 10:58.717
that most people
have no clue exist,

10:58.784 --> 11:00.521
and this is
my little pocket, okay?

11:00.588 --> 11:02.157
For junk.

11:02.224 --> 11:04.494
Shit, I used up
the extra Liquesco.

11:04.562 --> 11:05.931
Okay, plan B.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.768
Gotta admit, more skeletons

11:07.835 --> 11:09.404
than I was expecting
to see tonight.

11:09.471 --> 11:10.774
They were all pieces of shit.

11:10.841 --> 11:12.043
All right, can you shut up
for a second?

11:12.110 --> 11:13.246
You got us stuck in this place.

11:13.312 --> 11:15.049
I need to focus
on getting us out.

11:15.116 --> 11:17.989
I think the real issue is you
have this place to begin with.

11:18.055 --> 11:19.826
We can't all rosé
the day away.

11:19.893 --> 11:21.696
It's called self-preservation.

11:21.763 --> 11:22.999
You know, Laur,
one of these days,

11:23.065 --> 11:24.869
your stinger's gonna
sting you right back.

11:24.936 --> 11:26.171
This is a guy
I used to torture.

11:26.238 --> 11:27.642
Don't say anything to him,
all right?

11:27.708 --> 11:28.710
Mum's the word.

11:31.382 --> 11:33.019
Oh-ho-ho, Laura!

11:33.085 --> 11:34.722
My favorite person
in all the realms.

11:34.789 --> 11:36.358
Jesus Christ,
I wish you were dead.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.464
Oh, you said the same thing
last week.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.001
- Last week?
- Darlene, Jimmy.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.738
Jimmy, Darlene.
- A pleasure.

11:42.805 --> 11:44.642
Did Chrissy like
that summer scarf I made her?

11:44.709 --> 11:46.345
It's hard to find
breathable materials.

11:46.412 --> 11:47.615
I threw it away, asshole.

11:47.682 --> 11:48.684
You and your shit
are worthless.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.053
Now, give me the cape chisel,

11:50.119 --> 11:51.990
or I'll hang you
with your own nose again.

11:52.057 --> 11:54.428
Of course.
I use it as a tea stirrer.

11:54.494 --> 11:56.031
Oh, go fuck yourself.

11:56.098 --> 11:58.169
Now I just need
five milligrams of goofer dust.

11:58.236 --> 12:00.340
You tortured him?
He seems so nice.

12:00.406 --> 12:02.745
I wanna pinch his cheeks,
maybe pet his snorkel.

12:02.812 --> 12:04.181
That's not a sex thing, is it?

12:04.248 --> 12:05.718
- Don't, Darlene.
- Ugh, who am I kidding?

12:05.784 --> 12:07.087
I'm down either way.

12:07.153 --> 12:08.924
Don't even talk to him.
In fact--

12:08.991 --> 12:10.894
Oh, shit!
Shit, it's a goofer dust gust.

12:10.961 --> 12:12.364
I-I just--I gotta get in there,
all right?

12:12.430 --> 12:13.667
Don't move. Stay there.

12:16.438 --> 12:18.409
Ah! Where are my manners?

12:18.476 --> 12:19.779
Come on in.

12:19.846 --> 12:21.382
Let me get you
some Erberribble.

12:21.448 --> 12:24.421
Sorry, that's what we call
urine-rehydrated bone powder.

12:24.488 --> 12:27.294
Mm... fine, but I'm--
I'm not allowed to talk.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.830
Oh! Whoa!

12:28.897 --> 12:30.099
<i>
The DMV windows...</i>

12:30.166 --> 12:31.903
- Dad, heads up!

12:31.970 --> 12:33.941
Oh, oh.

12:34.007 --> 12:35.678
Don't worry, I got you, Pops.

12:35.744 --> 12:37.715
Chrissy, get in here!

12:37.782 --> 12:38.951
Hey, Dad, stab me.

12:39.017 --> 12:40.721
Oh, thanks!

12:42.858 --> 12:44.762
I hope he was an organ donor.

12:44.829 --> 12:47.200
He just got
a license to die.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.071
<i>Shit just got real... ID.</i>

12:49.137 --> 12:51.475
That's the one to beat.

12:51.543 --> 12:55.618
Man, I really do feel this
whole new connection to myself.

12:55.684 --> 12:56.720
It's like--

12:56.786 --> 12:58.489
Beyond human comprehension?

12:58.557 --> 12:59.993
Yes, totally.

13:00.059 --> 13:01.796
Ooh, my Choochies.

13:01.863 --> 13:04.234
Our contestants
have savagely murdered

13:04.301 --> 13:06.171
every exterminator
who's crossed their path.

13:06.238 --> 13:07.808
Now, for their final challenge,

13:07.875 --> 13:09.946
an audience member will choose
the exterminator

13:10.013 --> 13:11.616
our competitors must face.

13:11.683 --> 13:13.252
So, Brad, who do you pick?

13:13.319 --> 13:15.023
Queen, I choose
the Manananggal.

13:15.089 --> 13:16.058
I wanna see Satan

13:16.125 --> 13:17.561
have a serious challenge,

13:17.628 --> 13:19.999
and I also love her cookbook,
<i>Cooking with Carcasses.</i>

13:20.066 --> 13:21.435
Gorgeous.

13:21.503 --> 13:23.707
She's a fucking bat!

13:23.774 --> 13:25.476
Shit! Dad!

13:32.792 --> 13:33.927
And I'm just winging it.
Ow!

13:33.994 --> 13:35.096
You okay, Daddio?

13:35.163 --> 13:36.766
Oh, yeah,
it's like wrestling.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.603
Gotta play to the audience.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.373
Pop's still on top.

13:40.440 --> 13:42.678
But scoot over here
and blaze this son of a bitch!

13:48.557 --> 13:50.093
<i>
That's hot. [laughs]</i>

13:50.159 --> 13:51.696
<i>Oh, it's sizzling.</i>

13:51.763 --> 13:55.003
Wow, I haven't seen anyone do
something like that since...

13:55.069 --> 13:57.307
me.
- What was that?

13:57.374 --> 13:59.879
You're tapping into the core
of your powers.

13:59.946 --> 14:01.950
They're not just a tool
you can use.

14:02.017 --> 14:03.452
They are you.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.025
This is a taste of what
it's like to be all-powerful.

14:06.091 --> 14:08.830
Whoo!
Tastes pretty damn good.

14:08.897 --> 14:09.899
Imagine how good
it would feel

14:09.966 --> 14:12.437
to do this together
all the time.

14:13.607 --> 14:14.942
We won, baby.

14:15.009 --> 14:16.445
I should have known.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.519
Chooch, honey,
what's happening?

14:19.585 --> 14:21.623
I knew something was wrong
from the moment the show began.

14:21.689 --> 14:23.860
The Satan I knew could slay
a thousand enemies

14:23.927 --> 14:25.296
while taking a shit.

14:25.363 --> 14:28.102
I know why you're here,
and I won't let it happen.

14:28.169 --> 14:30.073
What?
Wh-what's she talking about?

14:30.139 --> 14:31.710
- Don't listen to her, honey.

14:32.978 --> 14:34.414
Wait, you can be hurt?

14:34.481 --> 14:36.218
He's been losing power
for a long time now,

14:36.285 --> 14:39.191
and the only way for him
to reclaim it is through you.

14:39.257 --> 14:41.996
That's insane, Chrissy,
and completely untrue.

14:42.063 --> 14:42.998
Think about it.

14:43.065 --> 14:44.836
You carried him
this whole show.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.773
<i>He</i> desperately needs <i>you.</i>

14:46.840 --> 14:48.008
She's lyin'.

14:48.075 --> 14:49.879
She's been out to get me
ever since I stopped

14:49.946 --> 14:52.283
coming on her show
and schtupped her mother.

14:52.350 --> 14:54.956
Ha! Classic Satan:
minimizing a powerful woman

14:55.022 --> 14:57.127
by calling her jealous
and out for revenge.

14:57.193 --> 14:58.496
No one wins my game,

14:58.563 --> 15:00.768
especially
if you fucked my mom.

15:02.137 --> 15:03.105
If you wanna prove
to your daughter

15:03.172 --> 15:04.408
you have the power...

15:04.474 --> 15:05.744
You must beat me.

15:05.811 --> 15:07.681
Get me out of here!

15:08.750 --> 15:09.919
Come on,

15:09.986 --> 15:12.023
why are you really doing this,
Chooch?

15:12.090 --> 15:13.927
You know how it goes:
the bigger the death,

15:13.994 --> 15:16.031
the higher the ratings,
the sweeter the--

15:16.098 --> 15:17.167
The sweeter the pussy, yeah.

15:17.233 --> 15:20.507
Release
the Choochie Coochies!

15:24.147 --> 15:25.082
So how do you know Laura?

15:25.149 --> 15:26.084
Oh, well, we're neighbors,

15:26.151 --> 15:27.688
and I was hoping
we'd be besties soon,

15:27.755 --> 15:29.525
but it's a work in progress.

15:29.592 --> 15:30.359
That's great to hear.

15:30.426 --> 15:31.361
Sometimes I worry about her,

15:31.428 --> 15:32.932
everything she's been through
and all,

15:32.998 --> 15:34.067
the whole Satan thing...
- Mm.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.838
Her childhood being
no picnic, you know?

15:35.904 --> 15:38.810
At her quinceañera,
the Titi Suzie cake debacle.

15:38.877 --> 15:40.246
She tells you a lot, huh?

15:40.313 --> 15:42.317
Deep down,
Laura's a good person

15:42.383 --> 15:44.387
and just wants to connect.

15:44.454 --> 15:46.659
I wish I were as good as her.

15:46.726 --> 15:48.129
Oh, Jimmy, you are.

15:48.195 --> 15:50.968
You're such a kind,
good snorkel monster.

15:51.034 --> 15:51.970
You...

15:52.036 --> 15:53.807
You think so?

15:53.874 --> 15:54.942
Oh, my God, you kidding me?

15:55.009 --> 15:56.311
You got a great personality,
a house,

15:56.378 --> 15:57.648
what seems to be a job,

15:57.715 --> 15:59.986
and if the schnoz
matches the schmeckle,

16:00.052 --> 16:02.390
I'll call you
the whole package.

16:02.457 --> 16:04.094
Uh-oh!

16:05.129 --> 16:07.601
Aah! Oh, damn it, Darlene!

16:09.605 --> 16:11.141
I said leave it to me.
Oh!

16:11.208 --> 16:13.012
Ego monsters are triggered
by compliments.

16:13.078 --> 16:14.849
Ego monster?
- When I catch you,

16:14.916 --> 16:16.920
I'll turn you both
into trophies,

16:16.986 --> 16:19.191
because I'm a winner!

16:19.257 --> 16:20.393
It would have helped

16:20.459 --> 16:22.163
if you actually
communicated that to me.

16:22.230 --> 16:24.334
Fuck yourself,
you ugly elephant asshole!

16:24.401 --> 16:26.171
What good would that have done?

16:26.238 --> 16:28.275
I communicated I didn't
wanna go out tonight.

16:28.342 --> 16:29.779
I communicated
to watch the door,

16:29.846 --> 16:30.914
and you didn't listen.

16:30.981 --> 16:32.250
You speak in fragments.

16:32.317 --> 16:33.587
It's never enough info.

16:33.653 --> 16:35.757
Oh, God.

16:35.824 --> 16:38.028
And I brought you out tonight
because sometimes

16:38.095 --> 16:39.632
friends gotta force friends
to do things

16:39.699 --> 16:42.470
they don't wanna do
for their mental health.

16:43.874 --> 16:45.209
I missed deliberately!

16:45.276 --> 16:47.113
I hated that part
of the ground!

16:47.180 --> 16:48.683
I am so cool!

16:48.750 --> 16:50.821
This is exactly
why I don't have friends.

16:50.888 --> 16:52.691
I know what works for me.

16:54.394 --> 16:56.733
This has been
working for you?

16:56.799 --> 16:58.135
You'd rather deal with monsters

16:58.202 --> 16:59.437
instead of having drinks
with me?

16:59.505 --> 17:00.807
At least I'd get a word in

17:00.874 --> 17:03.145
instead of being steamrolled
by some delusional optimist.

17:03.212 --> 17:04.582
Oh, I think
he's getting tired.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.053
We're gonna be okay. Oh!
- What?

17:07.120 --> 17:08.322
- Oh, never mind.

17:08.389 --> 17:10.326
"Oh, never mind."
Shut up, Darlene.

17:11.094 --> 17:12.765
Chrissy, she's trying
to divide us.

17:12.831 --> 17:14.401
We stick together, we're fine.

17:14.467 --> 17:17.040
So break outta that bubble
and come help Daddy.

17:18.108 --> 17:19.545
Chrissy!

17:19.612 --> 17:21.014
I don't know why I let myself
believe you again.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.518
I'm such an idiot.

17:22.585 --> 17:24.487
You care more about this pact
than your own daughter.

17:24.555 --> 17:26.358
- Not true.
- Do you even like me?

17:26.425 --> 17:28.930
- Of course I do.
- What's my middle name?

17:29.364 --> 17:30.767
- Girl Satan?
- What?

17:30.834 --> 17:32.103
I don't fucking know.

17:32.170 --> 17:33.540
Okay, fine. All right.

17:33.607 --> 17:35.744
I brought you here
under false pretenses,

17:35.811 --> 17:37.113
but I do care.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.717
No, if you did,
you wouldn't have put me

17:38.783 --> 17:39.819
through all this shit.

17:39.885 --> 17:41.255
You are so goddamn selfish.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.992
Why can't you just
be honest with me?

17:43.058 --> 17:45.429
Okay, okay.
The queen is right.

17:45.496 --> 17:47.400
I have lost a little power.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.006
When you were born, part
of myself transferred to you.

17:50.072 --> 17:52.978
I just want to make it
so no one can hurt us, honey.

17:53.045 --> 17:56.953
Looks like the baddest boy
has become the saddest boy.

17:57.020 --> 17:58.355
How you like that, TV land?

17:58.422 --> 18:00.928
Uh, is this part of the show?

18:00.994 --> 18:02.297
Oh, I know you're impressed,

18:02.363 --> 18:05.002
because this is
objectively impressive.

18:05.069 --> 18:06.405
This is why
your husband left you.

18:06.471 --> 18:07.975
Ugh, typical Laura.

18:08.042 --> 18:09.645
I'm sure
your husband misses you.

18:09.712 --> 18:10.714
Oh, Jesus, Darlene,

18:10.781 --> 18:13.385
you need to kill
his confidence, or we die.

18:13.452 --> 18:15.557
Guess being toxic
isn't as easy for me

18:15.624 --> 18:17.661
as it is for you.

18:19.532 --> 18:22.370
Looking at your face
just jump-started my menopause.

18:22.437 --> 18:23.940
Yeah, I'm toxic, okay?

18:24.007 --> 18:25.944
Maybe I'm drawn to dark shit
because deep down,

18:26.011 --> 18:28.315
I think I'm too screwed up
for anything better.

18:30.621 --> 18:33.058
Uh... snorkel monster?
More like--

18:33.125 --> 18:35.631
more like dorkel monster.

18:35.697 --> 18:37.133
Okay, I'm shocked
that one worked.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.805
Listen, I know I come off
as the perky neighbor type,

18:39.872 --> 18:41.241
but I can handle fucked up.

18:41.308 --> 18:42.945
I don't think you can handle
this fucked up.

18:43.012 --> 18:44.381
Whoa!

18:44.447 --> 18:45.884
Your children never call
because they hate you!

18:45.951 --> 18:49.257
I only laughed at your
jokes to make you feel better.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.971
I'm blasting us out of here
with this goofer dust bomb.

18:56.038 --> 18:57.675
Start slinging insults.

18:59.311 --> 19:01.749
Laura trapping you here
is a gift to the world.

19:01.816 --> 19:04.220
My therapist told me everyone
has something to live for.

19:04.287 --> 19:05.924
Clearly she's never met you.

19:05.991 --> 19:08.963
I'd tell you to kill yourself,
but I'd feel bad for the knife!

19:09.030 --> 19:12.203
Holy shit, Darlene, maybe
you can handle this fucked up.

19:12.270 --> 19:13.840
Yeah, I can, babe.

19:15.276 --> 19:17.413
Come on, goofer dust,
do your stuff!

19:17.480 --> 19:20.554
- Hit the gas!
- Hold on, baby!

19:20.620 --> 19:23.392
Hey, Jimmy, stick this
up your small snorkel dick.

19:23.459 --> 19:26.331
Whoo!

19:27.467 --> 19:29.739
Thanks for all
the constructive criticism.

19:29.805 --> 19:31.308
Have a good one, pals.

19:32.544 --> 19:34.949
And this is the alleged
Princess of Darkness

19:35.016 --> 19:37.821
who is supposed
to bring upon Maximus Dawnus?

19:37.888 --> 19:39.224
Look at this,

19:39.290 --> 19:42.163
poor little bubble girl
can't even pop a bubble.

19:42.230 --> 19:45.904
Death to Satan.

19:45.971 --> 19:49.545
It's going to be fun
to watch you watch him...

19:49.612 --> 19:51.148
die.

20:13.660 --> 20:15.864
Ah, yes!

20:27.086 --> 20:28.623
Hot diggity dog!

20:28.690 --> 20:30.426
That went better
than I thought it would.

20:30.493 --> 20:32.831
Folks are gonna
lose their shit.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.134
You're a natural.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.570
Huh?
Well, this was

20:35.637 --> 20:37.775
kind of like
your debutante ball, you know,

20:37.841 --> 20:40.479
to introduce your savagery
to all the realms.

20:40.547 --> 20:42.316
But you almost died.

20:42.383 --> 20:44.655
Meh, nah, I wasn't gonna
actually die.

20:44.722 --> 20:47.326
I-I just wanted you to reach
your full potential,

20:47.393 --> 20:48.530
and you did.

20:48.596 --> 20:50.967
If that's true,
that is so fucked up.

20:51.034 --> 20:52.538
You're one to talk.

20:52.604 --> 20:55.844
I'm not the one who obliterated
an entire arena.

20:55.911 --> 20:57.413
You should feel proud.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.685
Maybe we get some waffles
to celebrate or--

21:00.887 --> 21:02.490
You good?

21:02.558 --> 21:04.260
No, I'm not good.

21:04.327 --> 21:05.362
I need a break.

21:05.429 --> 21:06.732
And if you wanna be my father,

21:06.799 --> 21:08.770
you need to be honest
from the start.

21:08.837 --> 21:10.540
If not, I'm done.

21:13.412 --> 21:15.015
Ow.

21:21.128 --> 21:22.898
Hey, thanks for getting me
out of the house tonight.

21:22.965 --> 21:25.402
That's what girlfriends do
for each other.

21:25.469 --> 21:27.106
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

21:27.173 --> 21:29.712
Been a long time
since I pulled an all-nighter.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.851
I'm still kind of wired.
You wanna go--

21:32.918 --> 21:34.788
To an underground casino
that uses Jell-O shots

21:34.855 --> 21:36.458
as chips
and get in a fistfight?

21:36.526 --> 21:38.495
I was thinking
more like a diner.

21:38.563 --> 21:40.132
Oh, the place on Elm
serves drinks late,

21:40.199 --> 21:42.538
and the waiters all look like
Patrick Swayze in <i>Road House.</i>

21:42.604 --> 21:44.842
Darlene,
you dirty old rascal.

21:44.909 --> 21:47.346
- Oh, wait, hold up.

21:51.622 --> 21:52.925
Sorry, I just had
to kill that goblin.

21:52.991 --> 21:55.095
- Oh, yeah, that thing.
- Yeah.

22:29.865 --> 22:32.538
- You failed us!

22:32.604 --> 22:34.307
You have no job,
no dick.

22:34.374 --> 22:35.677
Get out.

22:35.744 --> 22:36.512
No!

22:36.579 --> 22:37.648
<i> No!</i>

22:40.587 --> 22:42.456
I know what I have to do.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.496
- Hold up, what?
- Yup.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.068
I'm gonna kill the girl
who shot my dick off.

22:48.135 --> 22:49.805
Wow, so you no longer want

22:49.872 --> 22:52.009
to kill the Antichrist
to save the world?

22:52.076 --> 22:53.312
Nope.

22:53.378 --> 22:55.617
I just wanna get her back
for getting my dick shot off.

22:55.684 --> 22:58.590
You know, we've been friends
since we were in college,

22:58.656 --> 23:00.392
and you've always been
the guy who...

23:00.459 --> 23:02.531
Purged the world
of demonic forces.

23:02.598 --> 23:04.200
Yeah, that's changed.

23:04.267 --> 23:06.171
I don't know if you ever got
your dick shot off,

23:06.238 --> 23:07.608
but it narrows your scope.

23:07.674 --> 23:10.412
I like this for you.
It's refreshingly simple.

23:10.479 --> 23:11.682
Thanks, Tony.

23:11.749 --> 23:13.753
Well, I should
probably head out.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.991
I've got a little girl to kill.
