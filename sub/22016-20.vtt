00:00.860 --> 00:02.140
Daddies will miss you both

00:02.150 --> 00:04.330
- so much! Have the best time!
- Bye, honey. - Ohh.

00:05.010 --> 00:08.520
♪ We're alone! We're alone!
We're alone! We're alone! ♪

00:08.760 --> 00:10.900
There's a box out here
marked fruit of the month.

00:10.980 --> 00:13.870
I'm assuming that means
one of you won a contest.

00:14.050 --> 00:15.470
So, Pam's moving back home

00:15.550 --> 00:18.280
after living in our upstairs
unit for like three years.

00:18.350 --> 00:20.620
Uh, okay, it's been
a year and nine days,

00:20.700 --> 00:22.150
and she chopped us all that wood.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.220
Plus, she's taking Lily back
to see my parents.

00:24.290 --> 00:27.180
It's birthing season so
she gets to name her first pig.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.420
Oh, and then we slaughter it
on her 13th birthday.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.570
There's prayers and dancing.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.259
It's not unlike
your standard bar mitzvah.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.730
Except a lot more pork
and a lot less Jews.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.770
Anyway, we're excited to have
the house to ourselves again.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.700
♪ Naked breakfast,
naked breakfast ♪

00:42.090 --> 00:43.180
Just ignore it.

00:43.260 --> 00:46.640
♪ Making sausages and grits,
barely coverin' our bits ♪

00:46.720 --> 00:51.160
♪ Cookin' a frittata
while wearin' nada ♪

00:52.020 --> 00:55.460
I knew you two would
keep the side door unlocked.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.800
What would you do
if I were a deranged psychopath?

00:58.880 --> 01:01.480
I'd probably start with, "Hi,
Mom, what are you doing here?"

01:01.560 --> 01:03.540
Jerry and I had a terrible row!

01:03.620 --> 01:04.480
Ohh.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.210
Well, put on some pants
so we can hug.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.290
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Back to back.

01:07.370 --> 01:08.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09.330 --> 01:10.620
Why didn't we just back out?

01:10.690 --> 01:12.730
I don't know, but we're already
committed to this.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.990
<i>Okay, last run.</i>

01:27.060 --> 01:29.960
And then we clean up
or your mom will be mad.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.660
And go!

01:34.800 --> 01:36.490
Nice job.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.090
Keep her steady.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.880
- Okay.
- Got this.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.170
- Oh!
- No!

01:42.250 --> 01:45.840
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no!

01:45.910 --> 01:47.320
I recently sat for

01:47.400 --> 01:49.560
my Pritchett's Closets
presidential portrait.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.570
It's a dumb tradition
my dad started,

01:51.650 --> 01:53.710
but I kind of love
the way mine turned out.

01:53.820 --> 01:56.170
At least it's more
understated than his.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.490
The colors are muted

01:57.570 --> 02:01.170
and I am not wearing a sash
and service revolver.

02:01.290 --> 02:02.380
We're dead.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.890
We never should have
played with...

02:03.960 --> 02:06.210
Where is the drone?
Did you turn it off?

02:06.290 --> 02:07.890
I was asleep.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.900
Wow, this place looks dynamite.

02:11.970 --> 02:15.390
I wanted to give Manny
a nice premiere for his movie.

02:15.470 --> 02:17.920
He's been in such a dry spell
creatively.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.330
That modern dance recital was
like...

02:20.430 --> 02:22.320
Ugh, I couldn't even
look at that leotard.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.110
Okay, yeah, he's a terrible dancer,
but you don't have to use that word.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.480
For my film class,
I wrote and directed a short.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.010
I felt the horror genre was
the best way to grapple with

02:30.090 --> 02:31.060
the struggles of our time.

02:31.140 --> 02:33.020
When Manny first came to me
with the project...

02:33.100 --> 02:35.660
You read a script I left out
and you elbowed your way in.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.820
Semantics.
I was gonna be the silent money.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.760
But it turns out I've got some
natural storytelling talent,

02:40.840 --> 02:42.840
so I took on a more creative role.

02:42.910 --> 02:45.320
In spite of that, I got my first "A."

02:46.010 --> 02:47.580
Our first "A."

02:47.880 --> 02:50.410
<i>I can't deal with my mother's
marriage drama right now.</i>

02:50.490 --> 02:52.920
Nobody gets the love-lorn
back on their feet

02:53.000 --> 02:54.760
and out the door
faster than we do.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.760
We'll just trot out our...
our trusty "heartbreak kit."

02:57.830 --> 02:59.630
Is that in the closet
next to the earthquake kit?

02:59.710 --> 03:00.810
And the Eartha Kitt.

03:00.890 --> 03:03.610
Did you put those all in the
same place just to delight me?

03:03.680 --> 03:05.050
- I did.
- Aww.

03:06.090 --> 03:08.920
So, you have wine,
a self-help book,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.660
a-a pillow shaped like
the platonic ideal

03:11.730 --> 03:15.030
of a male torso for cuddling
and/or punching...

03:15.110 --> 03:19.830
And a DVD we made for you called
the "Donna Summer Olympics."

03:19.910 --> 03:22.260
It's a compilation of
all the sexiest male athletes

03:22.330 --> 03:24.420
accompanied by
the high queen of disco.

03:24.490 --> 03:25.720
Oh, you boys.

03:25.790 --> 03:28.840
So sensitive to a woman's needs.

03:29.370 --> 03:31.030
Unlike Jerry.

03:31.140 --> 03:34.550
Did I tell you that his mother
is living with us?

03:34.630 --> 03:36.300
Yeah, no discussion.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.670
She just shows up with her birds.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.290
Well, you know, Mom,
relationships take sacrifice.

03:41.370 --> 03:43.280
I mean, when
Cam's sister Pam moved in,

03:43.360 --> 03:44.560
it w... it was hard on me.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.330
I-I was constantly worried about

03:46.400 --> 03:49.170
the lost money
on the upstairs rental and...

03:49.250 --> 03:52.030
You know, Mitchell, maybe
we shouldn't discuss money.

03:52.110 --> 03:53.410
It can be a bit unseemly.

03:53.490 --> 03:55.690
I wasn't planning on
being unseemly,

03:55.770 --> 03:58.050
a word I've never heard
you use before.

03:58.130 --> 04:00.280
I-I'm simply saying how stressful

04:00.360 --> 04:02.940
having a long-term house guest
can be and...

04:03.020 --> 04:06.230
- Oh.
- Oh, sweetie, yeah, take a breath.

04:06.310 --> 04:09.690
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my God. No. No.

04:09.770 --> 04:11.180
You used to do this
when I was young.

04:11.260 --> 04:13.710
Did you get this move
from my mother?

04:13.830 --> 04:18.250
Mitchell, there is no reason for
this uns... um, high-temper...

04:18.329 --> 04:19.950
Unseemly!
You were gonna say "unseemly"!

04:20.029 --> 04:21.800
Unseemly!
You stole that word from her.

04:21.870 --> 04:23.530
Okay, okay, okay.
W-What's going on here?

04:23.610 --> 04:25.560
Are you two, um... friends?

04:25.630 --> 04:26.640
Yes.

04:26.710 --> 04:29.600
We talk on the phone,
e-mail, exchange recipes.

04:29.680 --> 04:32.140
Oh. Oh, is she the reason we've
been eating so much quinoa?

04:32.210 --> 04:33.770
- It's a super-food.
- It's a super-food.

04:33.850 --> 04:36.480
Okay, okay.
Can I talk to you for a second?

04:36.550 --> 04:37.820
Come on.

04:38.350 --> 04:41.280
Okay, no reason to lie about it,
'cause I already know.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.080
How long have you been
involved with this woman?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.210
Can I ask a question?
Is there a chance you're just

04:45.290 --> 04:47.390
kind of making this all
about Mitchell?

04:47.470 --> 04:48.700
That's her.

04:48.770 --> 04:50.550
Your mouth is moving,
but that is her talking.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.050
Okay, don't you see
what's happening?

04:52.130 --> 04:54.070
She's manipulating you
to manipulate me.

04:54.150 --> 04:57.830
Don't you think I'm smart enough
to know if I'm being used?

04:57.910 --> 04:59.310
I also have a mom.

04:59.390 --> 05:00.920
You're out of your league here,
bumpkin!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.600
Okay, this is a city mother!

05:02.790 --> 05:06.300
Wow. What happened to
the seemly man I married?

05:06.630 --> 05:08.390
You can't use it like that.

05:08.540 --> 05:10.600
Okay, how's it looking?

05:10.790 --> 05:11.890
Not bad.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.520
Who would've thought
Mom and Teddy Roosevelt

05:13.590 --> 05:15.080
were identical front-teeth twins?

05:15.150 --> 05:17.890
Okay, just give me a quick
minute to dry the glue.

05:17.980 --> 05:20.050
Oh, can you throw that shirt
on a hanger for me, actually?

05:20.120 --> 05:22.080
I need to look sharp for
Manny's premiere tonight.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.920
I play the Sheriff, which is ironic

05:24.000 --> 05:25.680
because I steal every scene
I'm in.

05:25.760 --> 05:26.900
Dad, no! It's melting!

05:26.980 --> 05:28.460
ZZ Top!

05:28.670 --> 05:30.280
I've ruined your mother.

05:31.330 --> 05:32.460
Wait a second.

05:32.530 --> 05:34.310
Today's your mom's monthly spa day.

05:34.390 --> 05:35.300
I'm not following.

05:35.380 --> 05:36.990
Afterwards, th-there's a brief window

05:37.060 --> 05:38.350
when she's at her most relaxed
and understanding.

05:38.430 --> 05:40.240
It's the best time
to give her bad news.

05:40.350 --> 05:41.970
I was gonna tell her about the $500

05:42.050 --> 05:43.910
I wired to that stranded
British guy on the phone,

05:43.990 --> 05:46.030
but... this seems
more important.

05:47.670 --> 05:48.800
Hi. Is Mom home?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.830
Honey, you look nice. Why?

05:51.910 --> 05:53.190
Did I hear Mom?

05:53.270 --> 05:54.590
Wait, you're dressed like a girl.

05:54.660 --> 05:56.090
No! You are not using the window.

05:56.170 --> 05:57.200
You got the last one!

05:57.280 --> 05:59.080
Did everyone know
about this window?

05:59.220 --> 06:01.260
You guys need it too?
For what?

06:02.930 --> 06:06.300
Oh, wow. It is not easy
doing something that dumb.

06:06.430 --> 06:08.310
Yeah, this is why men are over.

06:08.380 --> 06:10.580
I hope you enjoyed
the last 10,000 years.

06:10.660 --> 06:13.050
Listen, I have to bail on our
trip with Mom for Mother's Day.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.900
No! I have to bail,
you have to go!

06:14.980 --> 06:16.220
She cried when we asked her.

06:16.300 --> 06:18.640
But my boss invited me
to the Met Ball.

06:18.710 --> 06:22.000
Her therapy dog got the flu,
so I get to fly first class.

06:22.270 --> 06:25.140
- Well, on her lap.
- But Bill wants to take me away.

06:25.220 --> 06:26.540
This is the first time
I've had a boyfriend

06:26.620 --> 06:28.900
who's not spending Mother's Day
watching "Driving Miss Daisy"

06:28.980 --> 06:30.490
and pulling gray hairs
out of a hairbrush.

06:30.570 --> 06:33.340
Three asks in one window,
it's unprecedented.

06:33.590 --> 06:35.380
If we're gonna pull this off,
we're gonna have to make this

06:35.450 --> 06:38.320
the most relaxing environment
she's ever walked into.

06:38.890 --> 06:39.890
Surprise!

06:39.960 --> 06:41.550
- Nana!
- Dede!

06:41.620 --> 06:43.100
I'm sorry to barge in.

06:43.180 --> 06:45.280
I was visiting Cam and Mitch,

06:45.350 --> 06:47.770
and there's some tension
over there.

06:47.850 --> 06:49.620
Well, where's my daughter?

06:49.690 --> 06:52.950
I don't hear any
cooking or cleaning sounds

06:53.030 --> 06:55.180
so I assume she's home.

06:56.770 --> 06:57.790
Dad, what do we do?

06:57.860 --> 07:00.120
Mitchell must've brought her.
Maybe he's still out...

07:00.930 --> 07:02.270
Coward!

07:02.480 --> 07:05.090
Oh, just in time.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.480
"Chapter Five... Toss that clown,
he's been keeping you down."

07:08.550 --> 07:10.130
Cam, I spent my whole life

07:10.210 --> 07:12.610
trying to get out from
underneath my mother's thumb,

07:12.690 --> 07:14.770
and I-I finally thought that
that was over.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.320
So to find out that she's been

07:16.390 --> 07:18.180
secretly managing me through you...

07:18.260 --> 07:20.210
Okay, before you throw a clot,

07:20.290 --> 07:22.530
please, come look at my laptop.

07:22.610 --> 07:25.120
Read the e-mails
your mother and I have sent.

07:25.290 --> 07:26.950
743 e-mails!

07:27.030 --> 07:28.310
It's mostly from one thread.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.990
- Okay, look what she says in this one.
- Mm-hmm.

07:31.070 --> 07:34.140
- "Some kitchen items you might like."
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.580
- The stove, the tiles...
- What?

07:37.660 --> 07:41.000
The... the... the folksy sign
on the wall, Cam!

07:41.090 --> 07:42.950
You said that
these were your ideas.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.560
D-Don't you see
she incepted you

07:44.640 --> 07:46.520
and... and designed
our whole kitchen?!

07:46.640 --> 07:49.710
It was all so diabolical,
and it went deep.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.130
She tricked us into making
every decision in our lives.

07:52.200 --> 07:53.920
For example, 12 years ago,

07:53.990 --> 07:56.450
she sent me pictures of
adorable Asian babies.

07:56.530 --> 07:59.050
While hitting me with
a little reverse psychology.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.660
"Mitchell, America has taken
so much from the Vietnamese,

08:02.740 --> 08:05.150
do you really want to
snatch one of their children?"

08:05.660 --> 08:07.200
I do if you don't want me to!

08:07.270 --> 08:09.160
Oh, my God, 2004?!

08:09.230 --> 08:11.370
Th-That's a year
into our relationship.

08:11.470 --> 08:14.020
"Oh, Cam, I hate to think of you
living all alone

08:14.100 --> 08:16.300
in that tiny apartment
with a broken ankle."

08:16.380 --> 08:18.800
And on the same day,
she's e-mailing you,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.020
"It's too soon to move in
with someone.

08:21.150 --> 08:22.630
I strongly discourage it."

08:22.700 --> 08:24.330
Which is exactly
why I did it.

08:24.410 --> 08:27.350
- And because you love me so much.
- And because we were in love.

08:27.420 --> 08:29.010
- Oh, my God.
- Mitchell.

08:29.330 --> 08:31.260
- She's everywhere.
- She is.

08:32.260 --> 08:33.390
Cam.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.590
I'm scared.

08:36.669 --> 08:38.470
Jay, you're abusing
my editor.

08:38.539 --> 08:39.909
Wait, stop. Back it up.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.350
No, no.
The movie's done.

08:41.429 --> 08:43.059
We can't keep arguing
about this!

08:43.140 --> 08:44.320
Don't we both want
to cut the sheriff?!

08:44.400 --> 08:45.740
Yes! He stinks on ice!

08:45.810 --> 08:48.300
But it hurts the story if we
don't stay on him long enough

08:48.380 --> 08:50.570
in the closet to see
the terror on his face!

08:50.650 --> 08:52.550
You just want to see the
Pritchett's Closets emblem

08:52.630 --> 08:53.610
next to his head!

08:53.680 --> 08:56.150
No, no, no, not again!

08:56.290 --> 08:58.940
The red carpet that
they sent me is orange,

08:59.020 --> 09:00.800
and they keep putting me
on hold.

09:00.870 --> 09:03.950
I never thought that I could hate
hearing "She Bangs" over and over.

09:04.030 --> 09:05.070
- You didn't?
- Really?

09:05.150 --> 09:06.100
Manny, give me the movie.

09:06.180 --> 09:08.030
I need to make sure that
the projector is working

09:08.110 --> 09:09.400
and that the picture is good.

09:09.470 --> 09:10.930
Here, take it.
It's done, anyway.

09:11.010 --> 09:12.500
I don't know
what to do with this.

09:12.740 --> 09:14.610
I'm gonna need
to borrow your nerd.

09:14.790 --> 09:16.510
And why don't you go
get me a tomato juice?

09:16.590 --> 09:18.910
Look, I know we've had
our creative differences,

09:18.990 --> 09:21.140
but I really think
we have a hit on our hands.

09:21.220 --> 09:22.770
I'm pretty proud of it, too.

09:22.940 --> 09:25.190
And a little nervous
to put it out there.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.610
'Cause you made the monster
just like Mom?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.850
- No, we didn't.
- What are you talking about?

09:29.920 --> 09:32.650
That noise.
It's what she says all the time.

09:35.180 --> 09:36.670
<i>She's coming!</i>

09:42.090 --> 09:45.830
<i>Stella, no! Out, out!
I'll kill you!</i>

09:47.120 --> 09:48.410
How could this happen?!

09:48.490 --> 09:52.420
We spent weeks perfecting
the monster's trademark scream

09:52.490 --> 09:55.780
by combining a bunch
of unsettling noises.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.150
Horror movies are
all about the sound.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.540
Particularly when your
special effects budget

10:00.610 --> 10:02.620
has been repurposed
for an on-set massage chair.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.870
Hey, you used it
just as much as I did.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.270
So, our monster sounds like
your mother screaming?

10:07.350 --> 10:08.690
But we didn't know that
before we put it in, right?

10:08.760 --> 10:11.070
- No, of course not, we love her.
- To the moon.

10:11.150 --> 10:12.270
Maybe she won't notice.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.330
We better hope not.

10:13.410 --> 10:14.930
- It's your movie.
- It's your movie.

10:17.310 --> 10:19.330
She's asleep? How lucky.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.460
Kind of lucky.

10:20.540 --> 10:23.620
She said she was tired
and Haley gave her some... tea.

10:23.870 --> 10:25.190
What was in the tea?

10:25.260 --> 10:27.350
You want her asleep,
or you want to ask questions?

10:27.430 --> 10:28.230
Mom just pulled up!

10:28.310 --> 10:29.830
Quick, longest straw
goes first with her,

10:29.910 --> 10:31.620
then medium, then shortest.

10:31.700 --> 10:33.270
- Yes!
- Yes!

10:33.350 --> 10:35.890
- That's the short straw. You're last.
- Oh, damn it!

10:35.970 --> 10:38.110
I'm so used to a world
where the smallest size wins.

10:38.190 --> 10:40.610
This sucks, you guys are gonna
use up all of Mom's happy buzz.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.330
- Oh, there she is! She's here!
- Hurry!

10:45.940 --> 10:48.440
Cover her up so Mom can't see!

10:49.190 --> 10:52.030
- There she is!
- There's my beautiful family!

10:52.110 --> 10:54.820
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.200
Wait, why are those shirts
over there?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.280
Oh, sorry. We didn't finish
the laundry.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.650
Oh, well, don't sweat it,
handsome.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.680
Read a paper,
we ain't got problems.

11:02.760 --> 11:06.060
So, Mom, we made you lunch,
but it's so pretty outside.

11:06.140 --> 11:07.190
Let's have a little picnic.

11:07.270 --> 11:08.840
- Yeah, I love that idea.
- Fun in the sun.

11:08.910 --> 11:11.630
- Have some fun outdoors.
- Life is a picnic.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.560
I'm happy right here.

11:13.640 --> 11:14.290
Okay.

11:14.370 --> 11:17.080
Wow, this looks good.

11:17.390 --> 11:18.540
What?

11:18.620 --> 11:20.770
Oh, we're just so nervous
that we overdressed the salad.

11:20.850 --> 11:22.250
I can't even watch you
taste it.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.420
Oh, please.

11:25.130 --> 11:26.230
Mmm.

11:27.150 --> 11:28.500
Honey, this is so good.
What...

11:28.580 --> 11:31.030
Mom, I-I hate
to have to ask you this,

11:31.100 --> 11:33.920
but would you mind if I missed
out on our Mother's Day trip?

11:33.990 --> 11:35.290
Oh, no, why?

11:35.360 --> 11:37.390
Well, Bill only gets
one weekend off a month,

11:37.460 --> 11:39.690
and he wants to take me
to the Grand Canyon.

11:39.770 --> 11:41.450
- On a motorcycle.
- What?!

11:41.530 --> 11:44.140
Phil, chill.

11:44.650 --> 11:48.650
Sweetie, as your mom,
I know I should say no,

11:48.720 --> 11:49.600
but let's face it,

11:49.670 --> 11:51.710
those books aren't
keeping you warm at night.

11:51.780 --> 11:54.010
Let's get some bugs
in those teeth, huh?

11:54.090 --> 11:57.450
Mom, you are the best.
Thank you so much.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.580
That is so sweet.

12:00.890 --> 12:02.300
Weren't you just wearing jeans?

12:02.370 --> 12:06.230
No, I was not, and, Miss Dunphy,
my eyes are up here.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.270
Oh.

12:08.490 --> 12:09.440
What is that sound?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.920
- The house is settling.
- My stomach.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.070
Anyways, things are really good
at work, Mom.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.210
Haley's trying to cut.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.090
I finally realized
how much sacrifice it takes

12:16.170 --> 12:16.880
to have a career.

12:16.960 --> 12:19.040
You know, my boss, like,
she wants me to go with her

12:19.120 --> 12:20.280
- on this business trip.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.010
But it couldn't come
at a worse weekend.

12:22.090 --> 12:23.960
Welcome to the struggle,
sister.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.610
- The window's gonna close.
- Window? What... What window?

12:26.680 --> 12:28.340
Great news.
We moved the box in the garage.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.660
- The craziest thing happened...
- Talk about crazy things.

12:30.730 --> 12:32.200
You know
how the Met Ball is in New York

12:32.280 --> 12:34.290
and how I weigh the same
as a medium-sized dog?

12:34.370 --> 12:35.420
Haley, the grownups
are talking!

12:35.500 --> 12:37.280
Guys, guys, guys,
the knots are coming back.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.460
Mom, I'm bailing on our trip!

12:38.540 --> 12:40.470
I made Dad play and we flew
our drone into your face!

12:40.550 --> 12:43.040
A man named Nigel Pickles may
have our bank account numbers!

12:43.110 --> 12:44.890
- I'm gonna go.
- Stop!

12:45.390 --> 12:46.780
Sit down!

12:48.140 --> 12:51.020
Clearly, you all have
bad news to tell me.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.800
But do you have to dump it on me
when I'm in a good mood?

12:53.920 --> 12:56.800
Oh, my God, you did!
That's what the window is!

12:56.870 --> 12:59.960
The one hour a month when
I am a human to you people.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.210
Sometimes it's longer.

13:01.290 --> 13:02.860
Let me tell you something.

13:02.930 --> 13:04.430
You debutantes have it easy.

13:04.510 --> 13:06.840
You wouldn't have
survived one day

13:06.920 --> 13:08.250
in the house
where I grew up,

13:08.330 --> 13:11.570
where an actual crazy person
was running the show.

13:11.650 --> 13:14.160
- Um, Claire...
- The guilting, the shaming,

13:14.230 --> 13:16.160
the number of times I heard

13:16.230 --> 13:19.230
- "Where did I go wrong with you?"
- Where did I go wrong with you?

13:19.300 --> 13:21.160
- Mom.
- Mom, Nana's here.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.450
Yeah. I'm sorry.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.070
- Save it.
- I know where I'm not wanted.

13:25.150 --> 13:27.380
And no,
I'm not trying to guilt you.

13:27.460 --> 13:29.280
I can't waste
the energy on that,

13:29.360 --> 13:31.540
as I am basically homeless

13:31.620 --> 13:34.750
now that my marriage
has unraveled.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.690
- Claire...
- No!

13:38.040 --> 13:40.990
No! We are going to sit here
in silence

13:41.070 --> 13:44.960
until it is my turn
to storm out.

13:46.350 --> 13:47.740
No drinking!

13:48.350 --> 13:49.450
For you.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.520
If Mom starts to think
the monster sounds familiar,

13:52.590 --> 13:54.420
I say we tell her
it's Stella barking.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.140
And hurt Stella's feelings?
Think!

14:00.500 --> 14:02.060
Dede? What are you doing here?

14:02.140 --> 14:03.950
Our children are horrible.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.510
I'm sorry to barge in.

14:06.590 --> 14:09.340
Oh. Gloria's holding a soiree.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.960
I should go.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.210
You will do no such thing.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.330
You come with me, young lady.

14:15.410 --> 14:16.910
<i>She was
the perfect secret weapon.</i>

14:16.990 --> 14:18.550
We send her upstairs
to freshen up,

14:18.620 --> 14:21.040
just before the movie starts,
we drop the Dede bomb.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.900
Gloria's flustered,
off her game,

14:22.980 --> 14:25.010
she doesn't even
pay attention to the film.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.310
You still got it.

14:26.420 --> 14:27.920
And to think
I was worried last night

14:27.990 --> 14:29.820
when you kept trying to turn on
your phone flashlight

14:29.890 --> 14:32.900
and. ended up taking 30 pictu..res
of your angry face.

14:33.350 --> 14:37.380
There they are,
my handsome movie makers.

14:38.050 --> 14:39.660
What are you wearing?

14:39.730 --> 14:41.500
What are you wearing?

14:41.650 --> 14:43.230
What are you wearing?

14:43.310 --> 14:44.650
Whatever I want.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.230
Okay, I just found out that
my mother

14:46.310 --> 14:48.860
has been secretly controlling
every decision we've ever made,

14:48.930 --> 14:51.020
so we are taking our lives back.

14:51.090 --> 14:53.260
She thinks this color washes me
out. Well, guess what?

14:53.330 --> 14:55.600
- She was right?
- You match the carpet.

14:55.680 --> 14:57.160
Use more teeth when you talk,

14:57.240 --> 14:58.630
because I'm losing
your whole face.

14:58.710 --> 15:00.200
Okay, pay them no never mind.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.020
Uh, she also implied
15 years ago

15:02.100 --> 15:05.050
that Cam's accent was trashy,
so that's also happening.

15:05.130 --> 15:06.570
Yep, and it came right
back to me

15:06.650 --> 15:08.830
like a cheatin' husband
on his rent day.

15:08.980 --> 15:10.710
Grab yourselves a drink.

15:11.170 --> 15:13.070
Sorry I'm late.

15:13.210 --> 15:16.020
What the hell?
Does no one know what

15:16.100 --> 15:18.840
"upscale cocktail Hollywood
glamour fabulous" means?

15:18.920 --> 15:19.970
- Hello.
- Gloria.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.090
No, I don't. I'm sorry.
I had to run off some rage.

15:22.160 --> 15:25.390
Mitchell, you're a lawyer.
Can I divorce my whole family?

15:25.460 --> 15:28.070
Are you even facing me
right now?

15:28.150 --> 15:31.420
- Tarnation, here comes your kin!
- Git! Git!

15:31.650 --> 15:33.590
Sorry, I'm still working on
the balance.

15:33.710 --> 15:36.950
Oh, there's Mom.
Luke, turn your cute on.

15:37.910 --> 15:40.600
There's my Sheriff.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.670
Go. I want to take a picture
with the poster.

15:42.740 --> 15:44.770
I'm sorry, I'm not really in a place...

15:44.850 --> 15:46.110
Pose.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.640
Ow!

15:51.150 --> 15:54.220
Mitchell? Sorry, I didn't see you
against the carpet.

15:55.590 --> 15:58.650
Mommy?
Nope. Not cute anymore. You're 40.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.260
You know, forgiveness creates
a biochemical reaction that...

16:01.340 --> 16:03.080
Don't care. You're up.

16:06.010 --> 16:07.960
You're gone, aren't you?

16:08.300 --> 16:12.660
Okay, everybody, sit down.
It's time to watch the movie!

16:12.740 --> 16:13.910
Is Mom still at your house?

16:13.990 --> 16:16.680
Oh, no, she ran off
all mad at me.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.680
I guess I'm not getting

16:17.760 --> 16:19.590
a recycled hemp Christmas card
this year.

16:19.660 --> 16:22.210
Well, Cam and I have a tiny bone
to pick with her, too,

16:22.290 --> 16:23.890
for controlling our entire lives.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.210
Not that it'll matter. We all
know what she's gonna say.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.850
- "Well, forgive me for caring."
- Well, forgive me for caring.

16:28.930 --> 16:31.600
- Are you kidding?!
- Look who dropped in.

16:31.670 --> 16:33.200
What a surprise.

16:33.330 --> 16:34.690
Let me get you a chair.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.400
Oh, don't bother.
Sitting's the new smoking.

16:37.570 --> 16:38.840
Mom, we need to talk.

16:38.910 --> 16:39.930
Oh, no, no.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.430
Just get in line, sweetie.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.800
Oh, shoot. Well, family first.
Let's reschedule the premiere.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.220
No. You will talk later.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.100
Nerd, the lights!

16:55.470 --> 16:57.240
Here comes the first test.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.720
I can't believe that
Dede is standing up.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.849
Worked like a charm.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.640
I don't know what was
more genius, bringing Dede in,

17:10.710 --> 17:13.319
or hooking the audience early
with some teenage sex.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.290
You were right to fight for that.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.520
This is my big scene.

17:21.589 --> 17:22.780
Big whoop.

17:22.940 --> 17:25.310
<i>Everybody, stop!</i>

17:26.180 --> 17:27.890
<i>We're better than this.</i>

17:29.460 --> 17:34.670
<i>So let's just think about that!</i>

17:35.540 --> 17:37.470
<i>I don't know if
I was being oversensitive</i>

17:37.550 --> 17:40.800
because of my situation with
Claire, but that editing stung.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.780
My huge speech, a fight with
the townspeople, all gone.

17:45.610 --> 17:48.100
<i>I'll never forget you.</i>

17:51.170 --> 17:52.690
Bravo bravo!

17:52.790 --> 17:54.130
All right, then.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.710
- Yeah.
- Very nice.

17:57.030 --> 17:58.780
Fine filmmaking, Manuel.

17:58.850 --> 18:00.450
You really got to
something visceral.

18:00.520 --> 18:02.670
I feel like I've met that monster.

18:02.750 --> 18:04.950
No, no, no. It's all fiction.
Now let's go eat.

18:05.020 --> 18:06.350
No, you know what,
that scream

18:06.430 --> 18:08.390
actually sounded somehow familiar.

18:08.470 --> 18:09.630
- Yeah, it did, didn't it?
- Yeah.

18:09.710 --> 18:12.630
Stella, no! No!
Out, out, out! I'll kill you!

18:14.610 --> 18:15.930
Oh.

18:16.140 --> 18:17.370
What?

18:18.890 --> 18:22.000
You made me
nto your monster!

18:22.220 --> 18:23.150
Not on purpose.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.890
It's just a bunch of awful sounds
laid on top of each other.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.480
How is that better?

18:27.560 --> 18:30.250
- Well, at least you were in the film.
- Phil!

18:30.330 --> 18:32.530
Well, now that we've reached
the Q&A portion of the evening,

18:32.610 --> 18:35.520
I do have a question for Mom,
if that's okay with her.

18:35.600 --> 18:37.360
Or do you want to tell Cam
to tell me what to do

18:37.430 --> 18:39.330
and then use reverse
psychology on me?

18:39.410 --> 18:41.750
Mitchell, if you want to
confront me about something,

18:41.830 --> 18:42.960
- do it now.
- No, I'm...

18:43.040 --> 18:44.690
I'm gonna do it
when I want to do it.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.960
Well, anyway, you look lovely
in the salmon suit.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.410
Oh, you know what? You know what?

18:50.490 --> 18:52.640
Okay, well,
how about this? Huh?

18:53.410 --> 18:55.100
- You realize what she just...
- I do realize now.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.440
Okay, you two are
being ridiculous.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.380
And if I may come to Mom's
defense for just a moment...

18:58.450 --> 19:00.410
- Oh, yeah. - What?!
- Yes! Yeah, uh-huh,

19:00.490 --> 19:03.620
and not just because I owe her
an apology, which I do.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.400
But, I mean,
do you like your lives?

19:05.480 --> 19:07.320
Are you happy with
the way things turned out?

19:07.400 --> 19:08.520
Instead of blaming Mom

19:08.590 --> 19:10.420
for helping you
make the right choices,

19:10.500 --> 19:12.380
how about thanking her?

19:12.450 --> 19:17.160
You know, it's not so easy to be
the one who always knows best.

19:17.230 --> 19:20.930
In fact, it can... make you
a little tense sometimes.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.410
This amazing woman runs
a company,

19:24.490 --> 19:26.000
she runs a family,

19:26.070 --> 19:29.350
and you don't show her
any appreciation.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.240
Just like you two.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.040
I put you two together
to do this movie

19:34.120 --> 19:36.470
and you turn me into
your devil creature.

19:36.540 --> 19:37.920
What do you mean
you put us together?

19:37.990 --> 19:40.370
I left Manny's script out
so that you would see it

19:40.450 --> 19:41.470
and you would get involved.

19:41.540 --> 19:44.380
I knew that this movie
was not going to be good

19:44.460 --> 19:47.560
unless I would take
his artsy weirdness

19:47.640 --> 19:49.850
and balance it
with your low-brow,

19:49.930 --> 19:52.210
couch-tomato sensibility.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.470
And that's why
it was so great.

19:54.540 --> 19:56.360
Gloria, I know
what you put up with.

19:56.440 --> 19:58.240
I-I was married to Jay.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.660
You are a saint
to stick around.

20:00.740 --> 20:02.180
Especially with that bosom,

20:02.260 --> 20:04.600
- you could get any guy in town.
- Mm-hmm.

20:04.680 --> 20:08.800
So, unfortunately,
this is what families do...

20:09.070 --> 20:11.370
they turn mothers into monsters.

20:11.440 --> 20:14.120
- Mom, that's not fair.
- That's not what we're doing.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.680
Everybody stop!

20:19.220 --> 20:20.640
We're better than this.

20:21.740 --> 20:24.090
What are monsters,
but pure, beautiful creatures

20:24.160 --> 20:26.290
we project our fears onto?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.050
And are they even scary,

20:28.120 --> 20:29.840
or are we just too terrified
to look inside

20:29.910 --> 20:32.870
and see the ugliness
and inadequacies in ourselves?

20:34.190 --> 20:35.470
So...

20:36.850 --> 20:38.640
let's just think about that.

20:39.310 --> 20:40.250
Thank you, Phil.

20:40.320 --> 20:41.750
- That's a nice start.
- He's right.

20:41.820 --> 20:44.000
- You're not a monster.
- Mom, we're sorry.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.700
We love you, sweetheart.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.290
If Phil had been half that good
when we were rollin',

20:48.370 --> 20:49.460
we never would've cut
that speech.

20:49.540 --> 20:51.640
He finally just trusted the words.

20:51.880 --> 20:55.160
<i>Everybody stop.
Oh. I'm stuck.</i>

20:55.620 --> 20:58.870
<i>- Is... Is this props or wardrobe?
- Cut!</i>

20:59.180 --> 21:01.850
<i>Stop! Everybody, I can't stop!</i>

21:02.190 --> 21:04.250
<i>Everybody... Line?</i>

21:04.330 --> 21:08.040
Everybody stop!
We're better <i>than</i> this!

21:08.120 --> 21:10.790
<i>- That's a cut!
- I'm sorry, guys, I'm not hearing it.</i>

21:10.870 --> 21:14.380
<i>Oh actually I'm at work, do you think
I could send you a picture of the rash?</i>

21:14.460 --> 21:16.690
<i>- Damn it Phil, you're in the shot!
- Oh, oh!</i>

21:19.190 --> 21:20.480
<i>Scoot!</i>
