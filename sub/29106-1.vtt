02:49.333 --> 02:50.699
How can you not see?

02:53.704 --> 02:58.574
They will bomb our cities,
burn them to the ground.

03:01.579 --> 03:03.045
How can you not see?

04:25.896 --> 04:28.508
<i>A nuclear attack is commencing.</i>

04:28.532 --> 04:31.712
<i>At this time,
all residents within a 400-mile radius</i>

04:31.736 --> 04:33.680
<i>should seek a fallout shelter.</i>

04:33.704 --> 04:35.437
<i>This is not a test.</i>

06:51.742 --> 06:53.775
<i>You aren't a very good alien.</i>

07:00.751 --> 07:02.095
Are you excited?

07:02.119 --> 07:04.898
Of course I'm excited.

07:04.922 --> 07:07.623
I've been waiting my
whole life to be this excited.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.737
I just hope you don't die.

07:10.761 --> 07:12.839
<i>I mean, I hear the vacuum of
space</i>

07:12.863 --> 07:15.175
<i>is a really bad place to die.</i>

07:15.199 --> 07:18.578
People's veins explode
and their heads explode,

07:18.602 --> 07:20.869
and all kinds of other stuff
explodes.

07:23.073 --> 07:24.940
Well, I'll try not to explode.

07:27.745 --> 07:28.745
That'd be good.

08:20.097 --> 08:21.140
<i>After traveling lightyears</i>

08:21.164 --> 08:22.208
<i>to escape an interstellar war.</i>

08:22.232 --> 08:26.212
<i>Upon the brutal assassination
of the president of Earth,</i>

08:26.236 --> 08:28.915
<i>the vice president took
over as commander in chief</i>

08:28.939 --> 08:30.717
<i>and gave the orders to bomb the
capital,</i>

08:30.741 --> 08:32.374
<i>which was overrun by aliens.</i>

08:33.376 --> 08:35.755
<i>This brave act was
made to save human lives</i>

08:35.779 --> 08:37.913
<i>and put an end to Nuclear
Holocaust II.</i>

08:39.049 --> 08:40.794
<i>Humans who sympathized with the
aliens</i>

08:40.818 --> 08:42.796
<i>wore symbolic blue face paint,</i>

08:42.820 --> 08:44.331
<i>and to this day continue to
commit</i>

08:44.355 --> 08:46.733
<i>horrific terrorist acts
against the government of...</i>

08:46.757 --> 08:48.368
<i>Time for dinner.</i>

08:48.392 --> 08:50.737
<i>These individuals' sick minds</i>

08:50.761 --> 08:51.738
<i>have been warped by...</i>

08:51.762 --> 08:53.006
What are you doing?

08:53.030 --> 08:55.008
<i>A dissection.</i>

08:55.032 --> 08:57.677
This is what you
spend your allowance on?

08:57.701 --> 08:59.346
It's science, Dad.

08:59.370 --> 09:03.772
I wanted to dissect a cat,
but it was too expensive.

09:04.808 --> 09:05.986
Almost done.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.921
Come on, you can finish it
later.

09:07.945 --> 09:09.044
It's time for dinner.

09:11.248 --> 09:12.958
I'm not gonna say it again.

09:12.982 --> 09:14.694
<i>Okay,
clearly you don't understand the importance</i>

09:14.718 --> 09:16.162
<i>of what I'm trying to do here.</i>

09:16.186 --> 09:17.653
Oh, I understand it all right.

09:18.722 --> 09:19.722
Wrap it up.

09:38.676 --> 09:41.655
I want to stop and see
your mother tomorrow

09:41.679 --> 09:42.911
before you leave.

09:45.115 --> 09:47.360
She's your mother, and you need
to say

09:47.384 --> 09:49.785
goodbye to her before you go to
space.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.789
Okay.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.992
Try to be in a good mood for
her.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.129
She loves you.

10:07.971 --> 10:12.018
I was gonna make pork chops,
but Mr. Johnson

10:12.042 --> 10:13.975
sold me some bad meat.

10:14.812 --> 10:16.289
I finished my sticks.

10:16.313 --> 10:18.324
Can I be excused?

10:18.348 --> 10:19.759
Sure, Jimberly.

10:19.783 --> 10:21.049
Get your plate washed up.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.172
Why'd you quit?

10:32.196 --> 10:33.039
What?

10:33.063 --> 10:34.063
Space.

10:38.368 --> 10:39.713
I didn't quit.

10:39.737 --> 10:41.414
Then why don't you go anymore?

10:41.438 --> 10:43.772
I wanted to be with you and
your mother.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.242
As close as I could be.

10:56.386 --> 10:57.986
Do you miss it?

11:05.863 --> 11:06.962
I'm gonna miss you.

11:09.032 --> 11:10.799
You're not gonna cry again,
are you?

11:11.902 --> 11:12.812
No.

11:12.836 --> 11:16.538
It's only for like three days anyway,
it's not a big deal.

11:25.783 --> 11:27.048
I'm so proud of you.

11:29.119 --> 11:30.318
I'm proud of you too.

11:52.009 --> 11:53.009
Hey Mom.

12:00.184 --> 12:01.184
Who are you?

12:04.087 --> 12:05.453
I'm your daughter, Sarah.

12:07.157 --> 12:08.157
No you're not.

12:09.092 --> 12:10.325
I know Sarah.

12:11.995 --> 12:16.264
You should meet her,
she is very much like you.

12:17.534 --> 12:18.534
I am her.

12:20.470 --> 12:21.470
No.

12:22.506 --> 12:23.506
You're not.

12:27.344 --> 12:28.344
Who are you?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.425
What do you want?

12:56.373 --> 12:59.474
<i>Welcome
to the Hoffman Space Center.</i>

13:00.344 --> 13:02.978
<i>Do not deviate from
your assigned destination.</i>

13:04.248 --> 13:07.215
<i>Irradiated guests will be
escorted to containment.</i>

13:08.185 --> 13:11.152
<i>If you see something,
it's your duty to say something.</i>

13:12.055 --> 13:14.623
<i>Lost items will be incinerated.</i>

13:56.033 --> 14:01.102
<i>Never,
in the history of the space program,</i>

14:01.271 --> 14:04.005
<i>has a child been sent into
space.</i>

14:05.108 --> 14:07.676
It is foolish.

14:09.179 --> 14:14.082
For children, you golden angels,

14:15.686 --> 14:19.265
brim with a hope that I have
rarely seen.

14:19.289 --> 14:22.435
<i>These children will
travel to the presidential</i>

14:22.459 --> 14:25.638
<i>space station,
newly constructed and orbiting</i>

14:25.662 --> 14:29.008
<i>a largely unexplored alien
planet,</i>

14:29.032 --> 14:32.100
<i>that one day may become our
home.</i>

14:35.205 --> 14:36.271
They are the future.

14:38.208 --> 14:42.143
Without them, there will not be
one.

14:43.113 --> 14:48.149
<i>Children,
they are the ambassadors of peace.</i>

15:10.307 --> 15:11.417
Hey everyone.

15:11.441 --> 15:12.441
Hello.

15:14.277 --> 15:15.655
My name's Sarah.

15:15.679 --> 15:17.156
I'm Tom.

15:17.180 --> 15:18.213
My name's Brooke.

15:19.249 --> 15:20.249
What about you?

15:21.451 --> 15:23.096
I'm Charlie.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.120
Well it's nice to meet you,
Charlie.

15:27.457 --> 15:29.769
So I'm really excited about this
mission.

15:29.793 --> 15:31.304
Me too.

15:31.328 --> 15:33.322
It's kinda cool.

15:33.346 --> 15:35.341
Not really that big of
a deal if you ask me.

15:35.365 --> 15:37.377
Well, we're about to make
history.

15:37.401 --> 15:40.580
Sure, technically I guess,
but my parents just say

15:40.604 --> 15:42.648
this is a big PR stunt.

15:42.672 --> 15:44.784
Us kids, we're just here to be
on TV

15:44.808 --> 15:46.719
and make the party look good.

15:46.743 --> 15:48.871
How do you know that?

15:48.895 --> 15:51.024
My dad's friends with
the secretary of security.

15:51.048 --> 15:52.759
My folks are pretty important
people.

15:52.783 --> 15:55.028
They said it would look good on
my resume.

15:55.052 --> 15:57.030
Well that seems fair.

15:57.054 --> 16:00.333
I applied and I tried
my hardest to get in.

16:00.357 --> 16:02.635
I spend my entire life
trying to get to this point

16:02.659 --> 16:04.726
and trying to be the best that I
can be.

16:05.762 --> 16:08.274
Am I the only one here who
actually cares that I got in,

16:08.298 --> 16:10.265
or is this just some kind of big
joke?

16:14.104 --> 16:15.470
It means a lot to me.

16:21.078 --> 16:22.143
More than anything.

16:23.346 --> 16:24.390
Come on.

16:24.414 --> 16:26.292
<i>Kids, not astronauts.</i>

16:26.316 --> 16:28.327
What are we really gonna do in
space?

16:28.351 --> 16:30.563
Tons of amazing things.

16:30.587 --> 16:31.531
<i>I really wanna get a look at</i>

16:31.555 --> 16:33.766
<i>the presidential space station.</i>

16:33.790 --> 16:35.201
<i>It's not every day you get
access</i>

16:35.225 --> 16:37.325
<i>to a high security
interplanetary vessel.</i>

16:39.830 --> 16:41.296
This table's a downer.

18:40.483 --> 18:41.594
<i>I've been given the
responsibility</i>

18:41.618 --> 18:44.352
<i>of shepherding you children into
space.</i>

18:46.756 --> 18:49.802
<i>I told my superiors that
this was a horrible idea,</i>

18:49.826 --> 18:51.237
<i>and I'd have no part in sending</i>

18:51.261 --> 18:53.661
<i>inexperienced children into
space!</i>

18:55.899 --> 18:59.567
But I was told I did not
have a choice in the matter.

19:01.905 --> 19:05.240
You will die.

19:07.244 --> 19:08.244
You will die.

19:10.380 --> 19:15.450
<i>Space is a last resort for
the most desperate of souls.</i>

19:20.457 --> 19:24.259
Why is it you children think
you should go into space?

19:29.432 --> 19:31.711
You got something to say, honey?

19:31.735 --> 19:32.735
Speak up!

19:34.271 --> 19:36.549
<i>Well, I've always dreamed
since I was a little girl</i>

19:36.573 --> 19:39.774
<i>of going to space and
having space adventures.</i>

19:40.577 --> 19:42.922
I really wanna help change
the universe for the better.

19:42.946 --> 19:44.946
And I wanna help those in need.

19:47.484 --> 19:50.485
<i>Space is a cruel hell.</i>

19:51.788 --> 19:53.821
<i>Great men die in space.</i>

19:55.592 --> 19:56.924
I'm not a man.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.578
<i>When you step into that
transporter,</i>

20:05.602 --> 20:07.769
<i>you're signing your own death
warrant.</i>

20:11.808 --> 20:14.809
If you're cool with that,
we can get on with it.

21:31.888 --> 21:32.888
Good job.

21:34.557 --> 21:35.623
You didn't throw up.

22:00.150 --> 22:01.150
Yes.

22:05.455 --> 22:06.455
Commander.

22:09.192 --> 22:10.192
Captain.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.439
Long time no see.

22:13.463 --> 22:15.863
<i>Still in the transport division.</i>

22:17.133 --> 22:19.645
That's an astute observation,
Jack.

22:19.669 --> 22:21.736
Address me as Captain,
Commander.

22:28.711 --> 22:29.777
I see how it is.

22:31.681 --> 22:33.626
You think you're special now.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.783
I am special.

22:36.619 --> 22:38.497
I'm a captain now.

22:38.521 --> 22:41.055
I remember when you
were just a filthy private.

22:42.592 --> 22:44.892
Do you remember that, Jack?

22:47.030 --> 22:47.973
During the war?

22:47.997 --> 22:49.357
Look how far that private's
gone.

22:50.967 --> 22:52.900
Permission to speak freely, sir.

22:53.970 --> 22:54.970
Granted.

22:56.206 --> 22:58.473
Why'd you put me on this
mission, Jack?

23:00.176 --> 23:02.510
You're so good with kids.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.713
At least, you used to be.

23:07.150 --> 23:09.984
We all have to live with the
choices we made that day.

23:12.755 --> 23:15.656
Well we all can't live with
those choices like you do.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Coward.

23:20.029 --> 23:21.929
Please go now, Brian.

23:25.134 --> 23:26.167
Aye aye, Captain.

23:35.845 --> 23:37.256
Are you children ready
to see the president?

23:37.280 --> 23:38.557
Yes!

23:38.581 --> 23:39.725
<i>Please keep your joy to a
minimum</i>

23:39.749 --> 23:41.616
<i>in the president's presence,
please.</i>

23:44.921 --> 23:45.921
Very well.

24:44.981 --> 24:46.892
Hey kids.

24:46.916 --> 24:51.196
<i>If it isn't young Sarah,
Charlie, Tom, and Brooke,</i>

24:51.220 --> 24:53.832
<i>our latest and greatest
diplomats of peace.</i>

24:53.856 --> 24:55.267
Welcome.

24:55.291 --> 24:56.135
I love you.

24:56.159 --> 24:57.603
I love you!

24:57.627 --> 24:59.805
Huh.

25:01.164 --> 25:02.942
Well how was the trip, guys?

25:02.966 --> 25:04.944
There weren't any roasted
peanuts.

25:04.968 --> 25:05.945
Oh.

25:05.969 --> 25:07.301
Well that is a problem.

25:08.204 --> 25:09.582
I'll just have to make sure that
they

25:09.606 --> 25:11.672
bring some for you next time,
young Tom.

25:13.109 --> 25:16.589
So, how about if I give
you a tour of the station?

25:16.613 --> 25:18.724
Can we see the control room?

25:18.748 --> 25:21.927
Of course we can,
young Brooke, of course we can.

25:21.951 --> 25:23.028
Awesome!

25:23.052 --> 25:24.930
It is awesome.

25:24.954 --> 25:26.087
Very awesome.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.778
Normal people don't tick.

26:36.793 --> 26:38.137
<i>This is the presidential space
station</i>

26:38.161 --> 26:40.039
<i>calling Earth, over.</i>

26:40.063 --> 26:42.140
<i>Mayday.</i>

26:42.164 --> 26:44.243
<i>We have a bomb on the
presidential space station!</i>

26:46.335 --> 26:48.012
Come on, we gotta get you
outta here,

26:48.036 --> 26:49.715
I'm gonna jettison you to a nearby planet,
okay?

26:49.739 --> 26:51.249
What about the children?

26:51.273 --> 26:52.785
Almost there, come on,
we gotta get you outta here.

26:52.809 --> 26:54.019
You must save the children!

26:54.043 --> 26:55.154
I can't save...

26:55.178 --> 26:56.438
Do it!

26:56.462 --> 26:57.723
All right, I'll save 'em, come
on.

26:57.747 --> 26:59.124
Out of the way, out of the way.

27:01.451 --> 27:02.451
It's all right.

29:16.018 --> 29:17.563
Brooke, is that you?

29:25.261 --> 29:27.005
Why did they have to put us all
into one?

29:27.029 --> 29:29.241
There are way more pods
they could've put us in.

29:29.265 --> 29:31.009
You're lucky to be alive.

29:31.033 --> 29:33.111
You really care what
pod you're in?

29:33.135 --> 29:34.695
Yeah.

29:34.719 --> 29:36.281
I'd rather be dead than
stuck in a stupid pod

29:36.305 --> 29:38.917
with you stupid losers right
now.

29:38.941 --> 29:39.941
I resent that.

29:42.411 --> 29:45.157
There's gotta be a
control hatch somewhere.

29:45.181 --> 29:46.641
It's busted.

29:46.665 --> 29:48.126
<i>Looks like I'm gonna have
to do a manual override,</i>

29:48.150 --> 29:49.595
<i>there's a malfunction
with the control hatch.</i>

29:49.619 --> 29:52.486
<i>Less talk, more opening the pod!</i>

29:58.961 --> 30:00.038
Close the pod!

30:00.062 --> 30:01.262
Close the pod!

30:11.474 --> 30:13.352
What are we gonna do?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.053
What are we gonna do?

30:15.077 --> 30:16.455
Where is everybody else?

30:16.479 --> 30:17.656
Guys.

30:17.680 --> 30:18.523
What are we gonna do?

30:18.547 --> 30:20.408
We have to find them.

30:20.432 --> 30:22.294
<i>We're on an alien planet
in the middle of nowhere,</i>

30:22.318 --> 30:23.962
<i>with no adult supervision.</i>

30:23.986 --> 30:26.265
Normally I'd say we have a good
time.

30:26.289 --> 30:27.566
What if nobody finds us, huh?

30:27.590 --> 30:29.201
Are we gonna have a good time
then?

30:29.225 --> 30:30.752
They'll find us.

30:30.776 --> 30:32.304
Actually, <i>statistically
speaking...</i>

30:32.328 --> 30:34.039
Okay, I don't wanna hear it,
poindexter!

30:34.063 --> 30:36.964
Yeah, shut up about your
stupid facts.

30:40.469 --> 30:43.604
<i>Let's just all calm
down and take a minute</i>

30:44.507 --> 30:46.173
<i>and figure this out.</i>

31:15.071 --> 31:17.683
<i>My calculations are correct,</i>

31:17.707 --> 31:19.718
<i>one day on this planet lasts
about as long</i>

31:19.742 --> 31:22.176
<i>as four days on Earth.</i>

31:23.012 --> 31:25.045
Better be some sunscreen in
that kit.

31:29.618 --> 31:30.618
Oh.

31:32.154 --> 31:33.154
You fix it?

31:37.326 --> 31:39.071
Really good with computers,
aren't you?

31:39.095 --> 31:40.095
It's a gift.

31:59.348 --> 32:00.348
That way.

32:01.784 --> 32:03.077
What is it?

32:03.101 --> 32:04.396
It's a distress signal.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.365
Looks like a couple miles away,

32:06.389 --> 32:08.188
it's probably other survivors.

32:10.259 --> 32:12.404
Then we better go find them.

32:25.074 --> 32:26.651
Why would someone
do something like that?

32:26.675 --> 32:28.135
Like what?

32:28.159 --> 32:29.621
Like try to murder the
president.

32:29.645 --> 32:31.390
She's so nice.

32:31.414 --> 32:33.580
Not all of the universe thinks
that way.

32:35.051 --> 32:36.528
Well they should.

32:36.552 --> 32:38.663
She's a pretty cool lady if you
ask me.

32:38.687 --> 32:40.665
Politicians are not cool.

32:40.689 --> 32:43.301
They just sit around all
day and have lunches.

32:43.325 --> 32:46.627
Cool people drive big cars and
blow stuff.

32:47.630 --> 32:49.508
You don't become the leader of
the most

32:49.532 --> 32:51.510
powerful civilization in the
universe

32:51.534 --> 32:53.779
without stepping on a few toes.

32:53.803 --> 32:56.648
He was just a sad,
crazy man with a death wish.

32:56.672 --> 32:58.305
I wouldn't worry about it.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.370
<i>A transmission device.</i>

33:42.485 --> 33:43.485
Children.

33:52.828 --> 33:57.531
It is so good to see your
sweet little shining faces.

33:58.467 --> 33:59.733
Such monuments of joy.

34:00.669 --> 34:02.336
We're so happy to see you.

34:05.274 --> 34:06.314
You need to come find me.

34:10.545 --> 34:11.745
Where are you?

34:14.683 --> 34:17.696
I know you can do this.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.719
I know you can do this.

34:22.391 --> 34:24.858
I'm typing in the coordinates.

34:26.795 --> 34:27.795
Thank you.

34:40.309 --> 34:41.309
Thank you.

35:20.516 --> 35:22.282
Why do you kids have no faces?

35:31.994 --> 35:34.661
Why do you kids have no faces?

35:37.933 --> 35:39.211
What are you?

35:39.235 --> 35:40.434
What are you?!

35:41.770 --> 35:42.770
Hmm?

35:51.981 --> 35:52.981
Hmm?

36:01.690 --> 36:02.690
Where's my cat?

36:04.994 --> 36:06.360
I miss my cat.

36:17.473 --> 36:20.440
Sir, please,
can I get you some pain relievers?

36:21.777 --> 36:23.021
Nope.

36:23.045 --> 36:24.045
No thanks.

36:28.617 --> 36:31.451
<i>I been sober for 12 years.</i>

36:33.355 --> 36:36.290
<i>Mister,
you need medical attention immediately.</i>

36:38.394 --> 36:39.394
Why?

36:42.498 --> 36:43.498
Your head.

37:03.786 --> 37:04.696
Stop that.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.866
How else are we supposed
to know if he's dead or not?

37:07.890 --> 37:09.768
Okay, he's clearly dead.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.603
Have a little respect.

37:11.627 --> 37:15.028
The dead shouldn't die if
they want me to respect 'em.

37:15.931 --> 37:17.409
Poor guy.

37:43.525 --> 37:45.125
Are you all right?

38:03.011 --> 38:06.146
I just wanna make my parents
proud.

38:09.752 --> 38:11.485
You will.

38:42.551 --> 38:45.530
Where do we go?

38:45.554 --> 38:46.731
To the president.

39:20.889 --> 39:22.467
I'm gonna die.

39:22.491 --> 39:23.768
No you're not.

39:23.792 --> 39:25.637
I'm so gonna die.

39:25.661 --> 39:26.971
No, you're not.

39:26.995 --> 39:28.173
I'm gonna die!

39:28.197 --> 39:29.729
Tom, you're not.

39:30.532 --> 39:31.643
I am.

39:31.667 --> 39:32.877
What do you know?

39:32.901 --> 39:35.480
It's inevitable,
really.

39:35.504 --> 39:38.171
Okay, both of you just
shut up or go and die already.

39:40.909 --> 39:42.053
That thing's worthless.

39:42.077 --> 39:43.588
<i>If I had time I could take it
apart</i>

39:43.612 --> 39:45.223
<i>and augment the coils
to improve the signal,</i>

39:45.247 --> 39:46.613
<i>it might work better.</i>

39:47.583 --> 39:48.726
Man, you're a nerd.

39:48.750 --> 39:49.894
No I'm not.

39:49.918 --> 39:51.963
You are by definition a nerd.

39:51.987 --> 39:54.566
I bet your mom was a nerd
and your dad was a nerd

39:54.590 --> 39:55.834
and your whole family bloodline

39:55.858 --> 39:57.168
was just a big bundle of nerds.

39:57.192 --> 39:58.192
No they're not!

40:00.262 --> 40:02.456
Okay?

40:02.480 --> 40:04.761
My parents weren't nerds,
they were both Olympic athletes.

40:06.134 --> 40:08.668
Then they must be
really disappointed in you.

40:13.609 --> 40:14.519
Whoops.

40:14.543 --> 40:17.544
Shut your faces and listen to
me!

40:19.248 --> 40:20.558
We're all in a terrible
situation

40:20.582 --> 40:22.582
and you guys are just making it
worse.

40:25.020 --> 40:28.733
Okay, what we're gonna do
is we're gonna keep on walking

40:28.757 --> 40:31.124
until we find food or other
survivors.

40:32.561 --> 40:34.672
And if we don't find
food or other survivors,

40:34.696 --> 40:36.074
we're gonna keep on walking.

40:36.098 --> 40:39.944
And we're gonna keep on
walking till we can't walk anymore,

40:39.968 --> 40:42.869
and then that will be the end of it,
you got that?

40:44.907 --> 40:46.016
Good.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.172
Now shake hands and make up.

40:49.945 --> 40:52.123
Sorry that I broke your stupid
thing.

40:52.147 --> 40:53.147
Okay.

40:56.618 --> 40:58.084
Come on.

41:17.973 --> 41:19.239
All right, let's go.

41:45.167 --> 41:47.801
Congratulations, you're not
dead yet.

41:49.004 --> 41:50.170
And I'll drink to that.

41:58.981 --> 42:00.814
They should not have brought you
here.

42:01.650 --> 42:03.127
I mean, there's beauty in the
madness,

42:03.151 --> 42:05.964
but no children should
have to bear witness

42:05.988 --> 42:07.120
to a world like this.

42:11.126 --> 42:12.325
Do you have any food?

42:13.195 --> 42:14.294
I got some.

42:15.631 --> 42:16.930
We're very hungry.

42:18.967 --> 42:21.267
That's your body
telling you it needs a fix.

42:22.738 --> 42:24.771
Takes too much to keep the blood
pumping.

42:37.853 --> 42:39.185
Quit looking at me, dammit.

42:47.829 --> 42:48.962
That's the last of it.

42:50.298 --> 42:52.365
No more guarantees after this.

42:53.802 --> 42:56.180
You're lucky you're kids, you
know,

42:56.204 --> 42:57.671
or you'd owe me big time.

42:58.907 --> 43:00.707
I don't give handouts to
anybody.

43:03.145 --> 43:03.988
Thanks for the food.

43:04.012 --> 43:05.412
Don't ever thank me.

43:06.848 --> 43:08.226
Left Earth years ago because
everyone was too busy

43:08.250 --> 43:10.128
thanking each other all the
time.

43:10.152 --> 43:12.263
It's just manners, Mister.

43:12.287 --> 43:13.820
Manners are for the rich.

43:16.158 --> 43:17.802
Otherwise everyone would treat
them

43:17.826 --> 43:19.693
the way they deserve to be
treated.

43:25.233 --> 43:26.110
Can I have a cigarette?

43:26.134 --> 43:26.978
Hell no.

43:27.002 --> 43:27.945
I got five left.

43:27.969 --> 43:32.005
I got five left and I'm gonna
smoke every last one of 'em.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.719
You got your whole life to
smoke,

43:34.743 --> 43:36.309
get cancer, and die, all right?

43:37.312 --> 43:38.222
Wait your turn.

43:38.246 --> 43:41.314
I wanna smoke and get lung
cancer now.

43:42.217 --> 43:44.751
Have you gotten in
contact with the president?

43:45.454 --> 43:46.831
No.

43:46.855 --> 43:48.299
Well we have her coordinates.

43:48.323 --> 43:49.300
She's alive.

43:49.324 --> 43:50.768
Well hallelujah!

43:50.792 --> 43:51.792
President's alive.

43:53.161 --> 43:54.272
What's your point?

43:54.296 --> 43:58.076
So shouldn't we go out
there and try and help her?

43:58.100 --> 44:01.412
And save her,
or at least try and find other survivors.

44:01.436 --> 44:02.436
Maybe.

44:04.973 --> 44:05.973
In a bit.

44:08.844 --> 44:10.009
She's going to die.

44:10.812 --> 44:11.845
Maybe she will.

44:13.882 --> 44:16.516
But I just survived a
brutal space explosion.

44:18.019 --> 44:20.865
And I made a promise to
myself that if that ever happened,

44:20.889 --> 44:22.400
I would take the rest of the day
off.

44:22.424 --> 44:23.835
Commander, she's going to die

44:23.859 --> 44:24.991
if we don't help her!

44:30.432 --> 44:35.101
Then why don't you go
be a big girl and go save her?

44:37.172 --> 44:38.338
I'm not gonna stop you.

44:40.242 --> 44:41.242
Go!

44:53.455 --> 44:54.455
Pretty cool, huh?

44:56.525 --> 44:58.802
Yeah.

44:58.826 --> 45:01.105
Got that off a dead guy,
in China during the 40-year fire.

45:01.129 --> 45:02.796
Have you ever killed anyone?

45:06.902 --> 45:09.903
Think a man like me goes
through life not killing anybody?

45:11.940 --> 45:12.940
I killed.

45:15.877 --> 45:17.343
Kill from time to time.

45:20.882 --> 45:22.182
You kill when you have to.

45:24.386 --> 45:25.429
Who was your first kill?

45:25.453 --> 45:26.480
Was it a grick?

45:26.504 --> 45:27.532
You weren't born in the right
decade

45:27.556 --> 45:29.189
to use that type of language.

45:48.944 --> 45:49.944
Killed my father.

45:52.214 --> 45:53.214
What for?

46:00.856 --> 46:03.389
He wanted me to become a man.

46:06.194 --> 46:07.227
Be not afeard.

46:08.930 --> 46:11.464
<i>This isle is full of noises,
sounds, and sweet airs,</i>

46:13.268 --> 46:15.902
<i>that give delight and hurt not.</i>

46:18.006 --> 46:21.207
<i>Sometimes 1000 twangling
instruments will hum about my ears,</i>

46:22.110 --> 46:27.180
<i>and sometimes voices too,
if I had waked after long sleep,</i>

46:29.017 --> 46:32.463
<i>will make me sleep again,
and then, in dreaming,</i>

46:32.487 --> 46:35.588
<i>methinks the clouds
would open up</i>

46:37.158 --> 46:38.591
<i>and shower riches upon me.</i>

46:41.663 --> 46:44.931
And then I woke,
and I cried to dream again.

46:49.437 --> 46:50.503
All right, girly.

46:51.339 --> 46:53.384
You wanna go save the president?

46:53.408 --> 46:55.486
We'll go save the president.

46:55.510 --> 46:56.621
<i>I just need to finish my
cigarette first,</i>

46:56.645 --> 46:59.991
<i>and you, stop asking me
questions.</i>

47:17.933 --> 47:19.332
Shooting is life.

47:21.202 --> 47:22.202
Live.

47:25.106 --> 47:26.417
Come on down, honey.

47:26.441 --> 47:28.219
Show me what you got.

47:28.243 --> 47:30.922
Not you, back Lou Berry,
come on down, raspberry,

47:30.946 --> 47:32.545
get your ass over here right now!

47:57.605 --> 48:00.139
Now it's your turn, come on.

48:13.755 --> 48:15.221
Well well well.

48:17.392 --> 48:19.092
Looks like you got some
competition.

48:28.536 --> 48:29.702
<i>Inedible.</i>

48:30.672 --> 48:32.705
Once we stock up, we move on.

48:34.142 --> 48:36.387
What kind of fruit was that?

48:36.411 --> 48:38.489
What I tell you about asking
questions?

48:38.513 --> 48:39.513
Sorry.

48:41.716 --> 48:43.260
<i>Inedible.</i>

48:43.284 --> 48:44.284
<i>Place is creepy.</i>

48:53.228 --> 48:55.161
<i>Inedible.</i>

49:06.441 --> 49:07.640
Are you okay?

49:08.576 --> 49:09.576
Do I look okay?

49:11.312 --> 49:13.224
Do I look okay?!

49:13.248 --> 49:14.380
Not really.

49:20.622 --> 49:22.188
I'm outta cigarettes.

49:28.496 --> 49:30.374
At least I don't have to quit.

49:30.398 --> 49:32.443
It's way better for your
health anyway.

49:32.467 --> 49:34.345
<i>I do not need a public
service announcement</i>

49:34.369 --> 49:35.668
<i>from you, okay?</i>

49:37.372 --> 49:38.671
Thank you very much.

49:56.357 --> 49:57.824
Well look at that.

49:59.694 --> 50:01.227
Who wants to go fishing?

50:41.736 --> 50:43.136
Fudge!

50:43.771 --> 50:45.838
Don't do that.

51:09.764 --> 51:11.564
<i>Edible.</i>

51:30.218 --> 51:31.617
Come on, y'all.

51:32.887 --> 51:35.821
Like you mean it, dammit, come
on.

53:20.395 --> 53:21.994
<i>Edible.</i>

54:12.447 --> 54:13.646
Sarah.

54:23.991 --> 54:25.057
Who are you?

54:28.429 --> 54:30.062
I'm your daughter, Sarah.

54:33.434 --> 54:34.567
No you're not.

54:39.640 --> 54:40.640
I know Sarah.

54:42.910 --> 54:45.578
You should meet her,
she's very much like you.

55:05.533 --> 55:06.599
Who are you?

55:35.863 --> 55:36.863
Hello!

56:23.511 --> 56:25.044
Is something wrong?

56:41.996 --> 56:44.797
<i>It's taking everything I have
right now</i>

56:45.867 --> 56:49.246
<i>to not tear you to pieces.</i>

56:53.508 --> 56:55.541
<i>An alien parasite has
entered my body.</i>

56:58.546 --> 56:59.678
Through my eye.

57:01.549 --> 57:04.850
<i>My brain and my nervous
system have been compromised.</i>

57:09.590 --> 57:10.756
<i>I want nothing more</i>

57:14.028 --> 57:15.227
<i>than to hand you my gun</i>

57:17.298 --> 57:21.166
<i>and have you send me to
my place amongst the stars.</i>

57:26.073 --> 57:27.573
I wanted to protect you,

57:29.911 --> 57:31.043
but I can't.

57:37.552 --> 57:39.963
You have to run.

57:39.987 --> 57:41.554
You have to run, please.

57:43.591 --> 57:45.724
You wanna know something?

57:46.928 --> 57:48.805
You wanna know something?!

57:48.829 --> 57:49.829
What?

57:52.934 --> 57:56.313
It feels good.

57:56.337 --> 57:57.736
It feels good.

57:59.006 --> 58:00.205
It feels good.

58:22.964 --> 58:23.807
We have to go.

58:23.831 --> 58:25.242
It's the commander.

58:25.266 --> 58:26.209
What about him?

58:26.233 --> 58:27.878
He's sick now.

58:27.902 --> 58:28.745
He's dangerous.

58:28.769 --> 58:29.947
Why?

58:29.971 --> 58:31.148
We have to go!

58:45.886 --> 58:47.631
It's a supply pod!

58:47.655 --> 58:49.700
What are we gonna do?

58:49.724 --> 58:50.934
We're gonna have to kill him.

58:50.958 --> 58:52.091
But he's our friend.

58:53.127 --> 58:54.304
Not anymore.

58:54.328 --> 58:55.606
Brooke, what are we gonna do?

58:55.630 --> 58:56.695
How should I know?

58:56.719 --> 58:57.784
I don't know, you're the smart
one,

58:57.808 --> 58:58.928
use your brain or something.

59:15.783 --> 59:17.194
A torch.

59:17.218 --> 59:18.218
I can fix this.

59:20.354 --> 59:21.798
Give me that hose.

59:21.822 --> 59:23.088
Give me that pilot light.

59:24.392 --> 59:26.970
Do you have any tape?

59:26.994 --> 59:28.171
He's getting closer!

59:28.195 --> 59:29.728
I can see that, you dick!

59:31.265 --> 59:32.331
I need a light!

59:47.782 --> 59:48.925
Burn in hell.

59:48.949 --> 59:50.160
Oh shit.

01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:36.440
I think we lost him.

01:00:36.464 --> 01:00:38.008
Let's split.

01:00:38.032 --> 01:00:39.843
Brooke is dead!

01:00:39.867 --> 01:00:42.801
She died doing the only
thing she was good at.

01:00:43.437 --> 01:00:46.116
Why did I have to be so mean to
her?

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:47.140
Listen.

01:00:48.743 --> 01:00:51.388
Brooke was a hero.

01:00:51.412 --> 01:00:52.456
A hero.

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:57.950
She died trying to save us,
and that's why we're here now.

01:01:00.121 --> 01:01:02.287
Let's all take a moment for
Brooke.

01:01:05.326 --> 01:01:06.925
<i>A true hero</i>

01:01:08.395 --> 01:01:10.262
<i>of science and bravery.</i>

01:01:25.179 --> 01:01:26.389
<i>The president's close, but I
keep getting</i>

01:01:26.413 --> 01:01:27.858
<i>some kind of interference.</i>

01:01:27.882 --> 01:01:29.459
I can't get her exact
coordinates.

01:01:29.483 --> 01:01:30.861
How close?

01:01:30.885 --> 01:01:33.096
<i>Half mile radius at most.</i>

01:01:33.120 --> 01:01:34.064
Hmm.

01:01:34.088 --> 01:01:36.533
Look, we can search the area.

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:38.535
Shouldn't be too hard to find
the pod.

01:01:38.559 --> 01:01:39.803
Okay.

01:01:39.827 --> 01:01:41.204
Let's meet back here in an hour?

01:01:41.228 --> 01:01:42.294
All right.

01:03:05.312 --> 01:03:06.445
No!

01:03:28.903 --> 01:03:29.903
Come on.

01:05:12.573 --> 01:05:14.317
I thought you were dead.

01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:16.074
I know.

01:05:34.795 --> 01:05:36.395
Well well well.

01:05:42.403 --> 01:05:45.103
Who would've thought you
two kids would've made it?

01:05:47.808 --> 01:05:49.619
Where are the other two?

01:05:49.643 --> 01:05:54.424
What do you think?

01:05:54.448 --> 01:05:56.715
This hasn't been a
good trip for any of us.

01:06:00.721 --> 01:06:02.799
Broke my leg a while back.

01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:06.825
They're just gonna have to cut
it off.

01:06:07.628 --> 01:06:09.261
It's starting to rot.

01:06:11.665 --> 01:06:12.831
You got any pink caps?

01:06:29.383 --> 01:06:30.849
You're full of surprises, kid.

01:06:47.401 --> 01:06:48.834
Need any help?

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:51.570
I don't need your help.

01:07:18.632 --> 01:07:19.764
Why did you do that?

01:07:21.502 --> 01:07:23.235
To put her out of her misery.

01:07:25.139 --> 01:07:26.238
You killed her.

01:07:28.609 --> 01:07:29.609
I had to.

01:07:31.645 --> 01:07:32.645
No you didn't.

01:07:35.649 --> 01:07:37.816
There's things that
you can't understand.

01:07:41.722 --> 01:07:43.355
<i>I was sent here on a mission.</i>

01:07:44.424 --> 01:07:45.424
No.

01:07:47.594 --> 01:07:50.340
<i>When I was a kid, I went to
the country</i>

01:07:50.364 --> 01:07:52.164
<i>to visit my grandparents.</i>

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.934
<i>My parents were working
the fuel plants in the city.</i>

01:07:57.571 --> 01:08:01.606
<i>This one day,
I woke up early and I went outside to play.</i>

01:08:03.177 --> 01:08:05.588
<i>Had a small net and I was trying</i>

01:08:05.612 --> 01:08:07.479
<i>to catch butterflies in the
meadow.</i>

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:12.662
<i>The sun was warm and
there was this cool breeze</i>

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.352
<i>that made it feel like heaven.</i>

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:19.823
They launched the bombs that day.

01:08:22.395 --> 01:08:24.529
I saw fire rise up miles to the sky.

01:08:26.366 --> 01:08:30.479
I heard one deafening sound and
felt heat

01:08:30.504 --> 01:08:32.270
from flames from miles away.

01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:36.942
It was the beginning
of <i>Nuclear Holocaust II.</i>

01:08:40.413 --> 01:08:41.845
I never saw my parents again.

01:08:44.785 --> 01:08:47.953
<i>The president of Earth gave
the order to drop those bombs.</i>

01:08:52.259 --> 01:08:55.260
She destroyed the only
form of life I ever knew.

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:59.209
It's not that simple.

01:08:59.233 --> 01:08:59.876
She didn't do...

01:08:59.899 --> 01:09:00.899
She did.

01:09:02.903 --> 01:09:05.215
You don't have to do this,
Charlie!

01:09:05.238 --> 01:09:06.805
What else am I supposed to do?

01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:12.410
You're my friend.

01:09:17.818 --> 01:09:19.350
It's too late.

01:09:20.988 --> 01:09:22.654
It's never too late.

01:09:39.906 --> 01:09:40.906
Okay, okay.

01:09:49.582 --> 01:09:50.582
Okay, okay.

01:10:25.519 --> 01:10:26.519
Come on.

01:12:21.568 --> 01:12:23.034
I have a med kit,
I can help.

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:25.171
Stop.

01:12:26.039 --> 01:12:27.083
It's too late for me.

01:12:27.107 --> 01:12:28.107
No it's not.

01:12:30.811 --> 01:12:31.811
Sarah.

01:12:33.146 --> 01:12:34.146
I'm so proud.

01:12:36.216 --> 01:12:39.818
<i>You are
a true astronaut and hero.</i>

01:12:50.464 --> 01:12:53.843
I need you to do
something for me.

01:12:56.203 --> 01:12:58.636
You have to trust me completely.

01:12:59.473 --> 01:13:00.583
<i>Of course I trust you.</i>

01:13:00.607 --> 01:13:02.874
<i>You're the president of Earth.</i>

01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:05.243
<i>Yes, president.</i>

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.713
But so much more than that.

01:13:09.516 --> 01:13:10.648
I don't understand.

01:13:11.852 --> 01:13:14.018
Within me is a time pod.

01:13:16.756 --> 01:13:17.756
A time pod.

01:13:18.992 --> 01:13:20.992
<i>What is that?</i>

01:13:22.095 --> 01:13:24.028
<i>Within the time pod,</i>

01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:30.702
<i>is the true leader,
passed down from generations</i>

01:13:34.207 --> 01:13:36.674
<i>through the world for eons.</i>

01:13:38.812 --> 01:13:40.756
<i>It leads our species on.</i>

01:13:49.923 --> 01:13:50.989
Cut me open.

01:13:52.926 --> 01:13:54.103
Take it, the pod.

01:13:54.127 --> 01:13:55.127
No.

01:13:55.896 --> 01:13:57.507
You must.

01:13:57.531 --> 01:13:59.709
I can't.

01:14:01.768 --> 01:14:03.646
You have to do it!

01:14:03.670 --> 01:14:07.950
<i>Whatever it takes,
you must get the pod back to Earth,</i>

01:14:07.974 --> 01:14:10.920
<i>or all that we've ever known
will be lost.</i>

01:14:21.187 --> 01:14:23.054
No, but you'll die.

01:14:27.327 --> 01:14:28.927
It's all right.

01:14:38.939 --> 01:14:39.939
Do it!

01:14:55.188 --> 01:14:56.588
<i>Keep doing it.</i>
