00:01.440 --> 00:04.930
- I am the matriarch
of a great American family

00:05.007 --> 00:06.925
taking on the ultimate challenge:

00:07.002 --> 00:08.535
The perfect family meal.

00:08.612 --> 00:10.000

You're Watching 123Movies.to

when I go to the bathroom
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:22.000 --> 00:22.037
- But that is what happens
when I go to the bathroom

00:22.113 --> 00:24.683
and leave you in charge
of the french fries.

00:24.760 --> 00:26.715
Well, give me another chance.

00:26.792 --> 00:29.132
- Ahhh!
- Give your Uncle Bob another chance.

00:29.209 --> 00:31.318
Bob, you're no uncle
and I'm no mama.

00:31.395 --> 00:34.195
Cute names are company policy,
that's all!

00:34.272 --> 00:36.304
Just feel-good stuff
so they can pay you less.

00:36.380 --> 00:38.299
- But we're family!
- Look around!

00:38.337 --> 00:39.833
- UH!
- Ohhhh!

00:39.910 --> 00:40.983
- Dad!

00:41.060 --> 00:42.940
- Ahhhhh!
- You okay?

00:43.017 --> 00:44.205
- Dad!

00:44.282 --> 00:47.734
- We're family!
- This is my real father, Bob!

00:47.810 --> 00:49.077
There's a difference!

01:03.574 --> 01:07.525
Time was drifted
This rock had got to roll

01:07.602 --> 01:10.900
So I hit the road
and made my getaway

01:12.242 --> 01:13.777
Restless feeling

01:13.853 --> 01:17.113
- Really got a hold
- Sorry!

01:17.190 --> 01:20.028
I started searching
for a better way

01:22.943 --> 01:26.204
But I kept on looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

01:26.280 --> 01:27.660
But I couldn't see the light

01:27.737 --> 01:30.767
No, no, no, stop, stop, stop!

01:30.844 --> 01:32.148
Ahhhhh!

01:32.225 --> 01:35.677
To take me through the night

01:35.754 --> 01:37.710
- I couldn't get it right
- Help!

01:37.787 --> 01:40.087
Help!
I couldn't get it right

01:40.164 --> 01:43.502
- Grab on to this rope here!

01:43.578 --> 01:44.882
Pull it.

01:44.920 --> 01:47.068
Ahhhh!
L.A. Fever

01:47.145 --> 01:50.252
Made me feel alright
Ah!

01:50.329 --> 01:53.934
But I must admit
it got the best of me

01:53.972 --> 01:55.199
Hi, people.

01:55.276 --> 01:58.344
Getting down so deep
I could have drowned

01:58.421 --> 01:59.764
Oh, save the fishes!
Save the fishes!

01:59.840 --> 02:02.640
Now I can't get back
the way I used to be

02:05.939 --> 02:08.739
But I kept on looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

02:08.815 --> 02:13.494
But I couldn't see the light
no I couldn't see the light

02:14.645 --> 02:18.826
To take me
through the night-ight-ight

02:18.864 --> 02:22.124
Couldn't get it right
I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina!

02:22.201 --> 02:24.195
I'm an astronaut, I'm a ballerina!

02:38.118 --> 02:40.074
Shave, shave, shave...
- Ahhhh!

02:40.151 --> 02:41.379
- Sorry.

02:41.455 --> 02:43.372
New York City

02:43.449 --> 02:46.786
Took me with the tide

02:46.862 --> 02:50.046
And I nearly died
from hospitality

02:51.005 --> 02:52.884
Left me stranded

02:52.961 --> 02:55.531
Took away my pride

02:55.607 --> 02:59.444
Just another no-account fatality

02:59.520 --> 03:01.936
Ahhhh!
- Oh.

03:02.012 --> 03:04.582
Looking for a sign
in the middle of the night

03:04.659 --> 03:07.076
But I couldn't see the light

03:07.152 --> 03:09.607
No I couldn't see the light

03:09.684 --> 03:11.909
- Huh, I'm gonna need
a bigger board.

03:14.248 --> 03:16.012
It's not a big deal, Rascal.

03:16.089 --> 03:17.892
We're only on the Bs, remember.

03:17.969 --> 03:20.538
Got all this to go.

03:20.614 --> 03:23.453
Okay, so we did burger assistant.
Next up, we have...

03:23.529 --> 03:25.179
business consulting.

03:25.217 --> 03:27.557
Butcher?

03:27.634 --> 03:30.357
Oh, whoa.
Hey, listen to this.

03:30.434 --> 03:31.814
Listen.

03:31.891 --> 03:35.266
"Cosmopolitan Butler School

03:35.343 --> 03:37.759
Become part of a family
in 5 days"

03:37.836 --> 03:39.294
Rascal,

03:39.370 --> 03:42.285
We're going butling.

04:05.758 --> 04:07.676
- Do you think
you canna be a Lassie?

04:10.552 --> 04:12.931
Nine-thirty?

04:14.733 --> 04:16.497
- Good morning, students.

04:16.536 --> 04:18.721
Good morning, sir.

04:18.798 --> 04:19.911
- Two lines, please.

04:19.987 --> 04:22.557
Chop, chop!

04:22.634 --> 04:23.899
My name is Butler.

04:23.976 --> 04:27.274
I'm a born butler
in all senses of the phrase.

04:27.351 --> 04:29.538
I come from a long line of butlers.

04:29.614 --> 04:31.034
In only five days,

04:31.072 --> 04:33.949
you will each receive
a certificate of competence

04:34.026 --> 04:37.976
to wait on any family
on this side of the pond.

04:38.052 --> 04:39.817
For those that are interested,

04:39.894 --> 04:43.116
the full English course
lasts a further 17 years.

04:43.192 --> 04:44.649
Standards are slightly higher.

04:44.726 --> 04:47.564
So, what does a butler...

04:47.641 --> 04:49.789
do? Hmm?

04:49.866 --> 04:52.206
Answer: Everything.

04:52.244 --> 04:55.044
He must cook, clean,
tend the garden,

04:55.121 --> 04:57.920
groom the horses,
write letters, iron shirts.

04:57.997 --> 05:00.719
Arrange appointments,
greet guests, run baths,

05:00.796 --> 05:04.326
buy groceries, pack cases,
unpack cases,

05:04.402 --> 05:06.780
make reservations,
cancel reservations

05:06.856 --> 05:10.309
and still find time
to be a confidant.

05:10.386 --> 05:12.801
Understood?
Yes, sir.

05:12.878 --> 05:13.876
- Yes, sir!

05:15.946 --> 05:17.826
- Grooming is crucial to the role.

05:20.588 --> 05:24.499
Substantial facial hair
is quite unacceptable.

05:24.576 --> 05:26.264
Rabbi,
how would you serve soup?

05:26.341 --> 05:27.261
- But really...

05:27.338 --> 05:29.793
- It goes, or you go.

05:29.869 --> 05:30.905
- Oh.

05:33.053 --> 05:35.623
- Butlers must be immaculately dressed.

05:35.661 --> 05:39.918
So what's your excuse,
you miserable heap of mess?

05:39.995 --> 05:42.871
- This is me tidy.
- Not in my book.

05:42.948 --> 05:46.055
Do you possess
any offensively tasteless tattoos

05:46.093 --> 05:48.318
perpetrated in a drunken haze?

05:49.929 --> 05:51.309
- No.

05:51.386 --> 05:53.726
- Any piercings of body parts?

05:53.803 --> 05:55.989
- I do have a series
of small holes in my tongue

05:56.066 --> 05:56.986
from when I was six.

05:57.063 --> 05:59.057
My cousin, he gave me
a black-sea-urchin thing

05:59.134 --> 06:00.706
and told me
it was a chocolate muffin.

06:02.586 --> 06:04.311
I think they've...

06:04.388 --> 06:05.501
grown over.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.495
- Show me your nipples.

06:09.144 --> 06:10.986
- My nipples?

06:11.062 --> 06:12.481
- Yes, your nipples.

06:17.698 --> 06:19.423
Hmm...

06:19.461 --> 06:22.261
You can't blame a man for asking.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.755
Frankly, you look the weird sort.

06:24.831 --> 06:26.481
- I'm weird?

06:45.236 --> 06:46.655
- Come on, come on!

06:48.995 --> 06:50.721
Tess! Tess!

06:55.783 --> 06:57.586
This elevator has already left.

06:58.813 --> 07:00.539
Ssstop that!
You're causing a delay.

07:00.616 --> 07:02.380
- I have an important meeting.
- If was so important,

07:02.457 --> 07:04.298
you would've left earlier,
like I did.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.909
- Mother, you're embarrassing us.

07:05.986 --> 07:07.405
- Stop.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.936
- Ow.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.544
Witch!
- That's a rude person.

07:12.621 --> 07:13.618
- Suck-up.

07:15.958 --> 07:18.106
- Any news, Judith?
- Not yet.

07:18.183 --> 07:19.410
- Okay.

07:20.598 --> 07:21.749
Kate.

07:24.281 --> 07:26.467
All right, go.
- Mr. Dickens called.

07:26.543 --> 07:27.810
Urgent.
- Skip. Next.

07:27.886 --> 07:30.494
Next, the investment
conference call. Urgent.

07:30.571 --> 07:31.415
- Save. Next.

07:31.491 --> 07:33.103
- Jacques called about dinner
on Monday.

07:33.141 --> 07:35.058
- Confirm. Eight o'clock.

07:36.133 --> 07:37.781
- It's them.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.390
- Okay. Put 'em through.

07:40.466 --> 07:41.425
- Good luck.

07:43.573 --> 07:46.603
- A word or two about money.

07:46.641 --> 07:49.096
Money makes the world go round,
doesn't it?

07:49.173 --> 07:51.052
Yes, Mr. Butler.
- Balderdash.

07:51.090 --> 07:52.356
Trust, not money.

07:52.433 --> 07:55.463
That's what makes
the world go round.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.995
If I haven't been able to produce

07:58.033 --> 08:01.216
at least one trustworthy butler
out of this course,

08:01.293 --> 08:03.748
then I've wasted my time.
- Ah-ah!

08:03.825 --> 08:05.895
Sorry. Sorry!

08:05.933 --> 08:07.008
- As I've made clear,

08:07.085 --> 08:09.577
you will be in complete control
of the household.

08:09.616 --> 08:12.953
However, you will be treated
by all other members of the household

08:13.030 --> 08:14.947
as if you were slightly less significant

08:15.023 --> 08:16.980
than a piece of used toilet paper.

08:17.056 --> 08:21.428
To simulate this, I've devised
a rather amusing little exercise.

08:27.603 --> 08:29.253
- You're enjoying this, aren't you?

08:29.292 --> 08:31.708
- I'm getting no pleasure from it
whatsoever!

08:31.785 --> 08:33.702
- Yeah, right.

08:33.779 --> 08:34.775
- Bull'seye!

08:34.852 --> 08:36.808
- Now, look,

08:36.885 --> 08:39.647
open wide for one teeny,

08:39.722 --> 08:42.370
weeny little baked bean,

08:42.408 --> 08:44.135
or I'll tell your mom.

08:44.173 --> 08:46.590
- But I'll tell her you hit me.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.548
- What?!

08:47.625 --> 08:50.425
- I'll tell her you hit me
and pulled my hair.

08:52.995 --> 08:54.720
Ahhhhh!
- Okay, leave the friggin' food.

08:54.758 --> 08:56.178
- You swore!

08:57.213 --> 08:59.515
You swore
in front of my little brother.

08:59.592 --> 09:02.430
Can I watch MTV tonight?

09:02.507 --> 09:05.537
- I will not be blackmailed
by you children.

09:19.229 --> 09:21.415
- Mrs. Withington,
what happened?!

09:23.870 --> 09:26.938
- Sorry, Miss Jamieson,
but they are the devil's seed!

09:27.015 --> 09:29.432
- Oh, no,
they're just playing with you.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.577
They're delightful children, really.
Undemeath all the horrible stuff.

09:32.653 --> 09:36.527
Please, I promised Jacques
I would not let him down again.

09:36.603 --> 09:37.831
- Ho-ho!
- Ah!

09:51.447 --> 09:52.597
Babysitters...

10:01.380 --> 10:02.608
- Hello?

10:02.647 --> 10:04.142
- Bob the Babysitter?

10:04.219 --> 10:06.098
- No, ma'am.
This is Bob the Butler.

10:06.175 --> 10:07.479
- Now, look.

10:07.555 --> 10:11.353
I definitely have this number down
for Bob the Babysitter.

10:11.392 --> 10:13.884
- Well, that was
at least seven jobs back.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.147
- But you were a babysitter once?

10:16.224 --> 10:17.490
- Well, yes.

10:17.528 --> 10:19.829
Ahem. Just once.
- Oh, please,

10:19.905 --> 10:22.092
this is an emergency.
- One minute, please.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.812
Rascal, damsel in distress.

10:25.889 --> 10:28.497
May I have your leave?

10:28.574 --> 10:30.453
Thank you, Master Rascal.

10:33.368 --> 10:35.055
I'd be happy to.

10:52.660 --> 10:55.154
- Oh... my.
Are you Bob?

10:55.230 --> 10:56.918
- At your service.

10:56.995 --> 10:59.180
- You-you have a piece of tomato
in your hair.

10:59.219 --> 11:00.293
- Oh.

11:02.747 --> 11:04.129
- Ew.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.739
- Gone.

11:05.816 --> 11:08.846
- Okay, well, um,
I want you to meet my children.

11:08.922 --> 11:11.070
This is my daughter, Tess.

11:11.147 --> 11:13.717
- Miss Tess. Hello.
Lovely name.

11:13.794 --> 11:15.328
- My son, Bates.

11:15.405 --> 11:16.977
- Mm. Master...

11:17.054 --> 11:18.665
Bates.

11:18.742 --> 11:20.314
Also lovely.

11:20.391 --> 11:22.155
- Gross.
- What's gross?

11:22.232 --> 11:23.267
- Okay.

11:23.344 --> 11:27.794
Have to go,
so do me a favour and...

11:27.870 --> 11:29.826
do not hurt him.

11:29.902 --> 11:33.124
Bob, please don't sit on any
of the nice chairs unless you have to.

11:33.162 --> 11:34.582
- Okay.

11:34.659 --> 11:36.999
- What's gross?
- Never mind.

11:37.037 --> 11:38.839
Good night, children.

11:40.105 --> 11:41.447
- Good night, Mother.

11:41.524 --> 11:43.174
Enjoy your romantic evening out.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.554
Have fun!

11:52.455 --> 11:54.219
- Don't forget the back ones, Master.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.671
- Why do you call me Master?
- I'm studying to be a butler.

11:57.748 --> 12:00.087
- I don't like it.

12:00.164 --> 12:03.731
Master Bates.
It just feels wrong.

12:03.809 --> 12:05.496
- Indeed.

12:05.572 --> 12:07.107
How about I call you Bates?

12:09.216 --> 12:11.901
- I like that.
- Yeah, just Bates.

12:11.939 --> 12:13.704
- Mm-hmm.

12:15.199 --> 12:17.424
- Miss Tess?
- Uh!

12:19.955 --> 12:22.142
- Oh, no. Not again.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.331
Water. Water!

12:25.747 --> 12:28.662
Quick, quick, quick, quick...!

12:33.034 --> 12:34.262
Oh, no.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.307
Hmm. Mm...

12:50.601 --> 12:51.828
Nice chair.

13:00.534 --> 13:02.452
- Bates. You awake?

13:02.529 --> 13:03.948
- When will Mom be back?

13:04.024 --> 13:06.709
- I think Bob's a real find.
He's so stupid,

13:06.786 --> 13:09.164
he didn't even tell me off
for smoking.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.657
- Smoking kills. I read it.

13:11.734 --> 13:12.999
- Sisters kill too,

13:13.076 --> 13:15.262
so keep your mouth shut.

13:15.339 --> 13:18.369
- He let me sleep
in my fireman costume.

13:18.446 --> 13:19.788
- He's crazy.

13:19.827 --> 13:21.361
- I like him
more than Mrs. Withington.

13:22.934 --> 13:24.774
- Would you like
to have him back?

13:24.851 --> 13:26.194
- Can we?

13:26.270 --> 13:27.804
- Leave it to me.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.842
- Thanks for a lovely evening.
- Ah, the pleasure was all mine.

13:41.919 --> 13:45.831
- I'd invite you up—
- I know, the children will up

13:45.869 --> 13:47.404
as usual.

13:47.481 --> 13:48.938
- Omigod!
- What? What's wrong?

13:49.014 --> 13:51.277
- The children's lights are all out!

14:00.291 --> 14:01.249
What's wrong?
- Nothin'.

14:01.326 --> 14:04.356
They've been good as gold.
- Oh, cut the BS.

14:04.394 --> 14:06.811
What, are they bound and gagged
somewhere?

14:06.888 --> 14:09.534
- You really should be congratulated,
ma'am,

14:09.611 --> 14:11.836
on raising
such wondrous progeny.

14:11.912 --> 14:13.944
Can I go now?

14:14.021 --> 14:16.054
- Uh, normally, they're, uh...

14:16.936 --> 14:19.008
a pain in the derriere.

14:19.084 --> 14:21.654
I think here you say "brats. "

14:21.731 --> 14:24.186
- Well, I never say "brats. "
- Well, I don't know

14:24.262 --> 14:27.024
what you did,
but I'm impressed.

14:27.101 --> 14:30.437
Jacques, will you pay Bob for me?

14:30.514 --> 14:31.434
- Of course!

14:33.352 --> 14:34.809
I'm, uh...

14:34.886 --> 14:38.683
tipping you
very generously here.

14:38.760 --> 14:41.406
I want you to know why.

14:41.483 --> 14:43.976
Tonight, with the kids in bed,

14:44.053 --> 14:45.587
all night,

14:45.664 --> 14:49.269
I get to do
what Frenchmen love to do most...

14:49.346 --> 14:51.571
- You gonna look in the mirror
for eight hours?

14:53.335 --> 14:54.754
Thanks, Jack.

14:56.710 --> 14:59.088
- This moming,
those of us that remain

14:59.164 --> 15:02.194
will address the basic skills required
for a typical day,

15:02.271 --> 15:04.266
starting with undressing the master.

15:04.343 --> 15:07.104
Now, I shall need a volunteer.
Mr. Tree, if you please.

15:11.093 --> 15:12.166
Jacket.

15:16.194 --> 15:17.421
Tie.

15:19.723 --> 15:22.024
Waistcoat. The vest, to you.

15:28.621 --> 15:29.695
Shirt.

15:30.538 --> 15:32.725
- Ah, come on,
haven't you got some kind of dummy?

15:32.763 --> 15:35.179
- Dear boy, if you intend
to be a butler, you better get used

15:35.256 --> 15:36.752
to naked old flesh.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.823
- You sure this isn't a British thing?

15:38.900 --> 15:41.546
I mean, most Americans
know how to dress themselves.

15:41.623 --> 15:42.735
- On the contrary.

15:42.812 --> 15:46.648
We are here to educate them
to do it better.

15:46.724 --> 15:50.636
And to dress for the right occasion.
- Whoa!

15:50.713 --> 15:51.786
Yo, I'm outta here.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.814
- Well, Bob,

15:55.891 --> 15:57.233
you seem to be

15:57.271 --> 15:59.726
the last one left.

15:59.765 --> 16:01.376
- Mr. Butler,

16:01.453 --> 16:02.910
I don't really know
if this is necessary.

16:02.986 --> 16:07.091
I mean... I'll give 100 bucks
if you leave the rest on.

16:07.129 --> 16:09.200
One-hundred and fifty.
A thousand!

16:09.238 --> 16:10.811
Please stop there.

16:14.263 --> 16:15.566
- Right.

16:15.605 --> 16:17.024
Mr. Tree, let's get cracking, then.

16:17.101 --> 16:20.016
Dress me.

16:21.358 --> 16:23.660
- Bob, no! Nuh-uh.
- It's okay.

16:23.698 --> 16:26.306
It's okay, Nico.
I don't wanna work here.

16:26.383 --> 16:28.646
I can't stand the sight of blood.

16:28.723 --> 16:29.988
All that screaming.

16:30.065 --> 16:32.903
- You took the guy's earlobe off.
- Not on purpose.

16:32.980 --> 16:35.166
Ah!
- You used to work here?

16:35.243 --> 16:37.083
- Of course I used to work here.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.270
"Barber" comes before "butler"
in the Yellow Pages.

16:39.308 --> 16:40.919
- So how do you like it?

16:40.996 --> 16:42.645
- Neat and tidy.

16:42.721 --> 16:45.253
- As the man says.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.938
- No beard.
- No beard?

16:48.015 --> 16:49.703
- Butlers don't have beards.

16:49.741 --> 16:51.466
- Butlers wear beards.

16:51.505 --> 16:53.154
- No beard.
- Abit of beard.

16:53.231 --> 16:54.765
- No beard at all.
- Itty-bit of beard?

16:54.842 --> 16:56.108
- No beard whatever.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.677
- Itsy-bit of beard?
- No.

16:58.753 --> 17:01.515
Not even a little bitty-bitty-bitty-
weeny-bitty beard.

17:01.553 --> 17:02.858
- Itty-bit of butler beard?
- Beardless.

17:02.935 --> 17:04.200
- Itty-bit of butler beard?
- No beard!

17:04.238 --> 17:06.770
- Itty-bit of butler beard,
itty-bit of butler beard,

17:06.847 --> 17:08.113
itty-bit of butler bear.

17:08.189 --> 17:11.181
Settled.
- So?

17:11.258 --> 17:13.635
- Well, pretty much as it is.

17:16.051 --> 17:19.925
- What do you expect to do, Bob,
if this doesn't work out?

17:20.002 --> 17:22.877
- I'll probably move on
to the Cs. You know?

17:22.954 --> 17:25.678
Camping guide,
carpet cleaner,

17:25.755 --> 17:27.060
carwasher,

17:27.136 --> 17:29.130
computer hacker.
- Extraordinary.

17:29.208 --> 17:34.653
You seem to have such faith
in yourself...

17:34.730 --> 17:37.492
where none is justified.

17:38.950 --> 17:41.212
- Thanks, Mr. Butler.

17:42.785 --> 17:44.473
- Well, well, well.

17:50.148 --> 17:51.491
Agentleman's gentleman,

17:51.568 --> 17:52.987
by George!

17:55.327 --> 17:57.091
- Loving breaths...

17:57.168 --> 17:58.970
of deep...

18:00.696 --> 18:02.268
...acceptance.

18:07.485 --> 18:09.518
- All right, can we speed it up,
please?

18:09.595 --> 18:10.000
Look - ahem -

18:10.000 --> 18:10.937
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Look - ahem -

18:10.937 --> 18:10.975
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:10.975 --> 18:13.277
here's my needs analysis.
I think it'll save time.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.277 --> 18:13.315
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.315 --> 18:14.810
- What are you saving time for?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.810 --> 18:14.888
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.888 --> 18:16.230
Yourfamily?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.230 --> 18:16.307
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.307 --> 18:20.027
But you don't even have time
to enjoy your kids. Or Jacques.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.027 --> 18:20.103
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.103 --> 18:21.753
- Jack's not family.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:21.753 --> 18:21.830
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:21.830 --> 18:22.000
- There's too much work.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:23.824
- There's too much work.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.933
I need more time.

18:26.010 --> 18:27.890
- Remember your mantra.

18:27.967 --> 18:30.805
- "I cannot organize the world...

18:30.843 --> 18:32.530
blah-blah-blah. "

18:33.643 --> 18:36.405
- Maybe you could work just as hard
and find someone

18:36.443 --> 18:38.935
who brings the best
out of me and Bates.

18:39.012 --> 18:41.313
- Tess, that is
a very sensible suggestion.

18:41.390 --> 18:43.347
Do you have anyone in mind?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.533
- Not really.

18:45.610 --> 18:46.645
- Well...

18:46.722 --> 18:50.710
I quite like the babysitter
we had last night.

18:50.787 --> 18:53.395
- But Tess said he was freaky.

18:53.434 --> 18:55.045
- He's too strict.

18:55.122 --> 18:56.655
- He's way too strict.

18:56.732 --> 18:59.187
- Definitely not him.
- Uh-uh.

19:01.105 --> 19:03.290
- Well, it's not your call, children.

19:12.880 --> 19:13.953
- What are we doing?

19:14.030 --> 19:15.718
- Come on, come on, come on.

19:17.328 --> 19:18.825
Up you get.

19:21.816 --> 19:23.350
Standing still, Mr. Tree,

19:23.427 --> 19:25.805
is highly prized in butler circles.

19:25.882 --> 19:27.185
- Freak.

19:27.262 --> 19:28.682
- Just get up.

19:30.292 --> 19:33.514
- Tiny people down below...

19:41.492 --> 19:42.680
- Good.

19:42.757 --> 19:44.599
I want you to clear your mind

19:44.675 --> 19:46.708
and relax.
- Relax?

19:47.897 --> 19:49.777
You kidding me?
I'm standing inches

19:49.853 --> 19:51.694
from certain death here.

19:53.190 --> 19:54.570
- I'll tell you what,

19:54.609 --> 19:58.560
think of the most beautiful thing
you've seen in the last 48 hours.

19:58.637 --> 20:00.017
- Other than your ass?

20:00.094 --> 20:02.664
- Now come on. You can do it.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.118
I'm beginning
to have faith in you, Bob.

20:05.809 --> 20:06.959
- Okay,

20:07.036 --> 20:09.529
I've got it.
- What is it?

20:09.605 --> 20:12.750
- It's a woman.
- Can you picture her?

20:15.512 --> 20:17.622
- Yes.
- Excellent.

20:17.699 --> 20:20.268
Hold that thought.

20:39.829 --> 20:41.824
- Hey, kiddo, how was your day?

20:41.900 --> 20:42.974
- Okay.
- Just okay?

20:43.051 --> 20:46.925
Mine was pretty good.
Do you wanna hear about it?

20:47.002 --> 20:49.571
- Does it have anything to do
with capital management?

20:49.647 --> 20:51.067
- Yes.

20:51.105 --> 20:52.524
- No.

21:01.422 --> 21:03.379
It's polite to knock.

21:03.455 --> 21:04.951
- It's bedtime, sweetheart.

21:04.989 --> 21:06.485
- I haven't finished.

21:06.524 --> 21:07.866
- Now. Please?

21:08.864 --> 21:10.129
- No.

21:16.457 --> 21:18.145
- Ah, that's just what I need.

21:20.062 --> 21:21.290
Thank you.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.707
Do you wanna hear about my day?

21:23.745 --> 21:25.471
- Now?

21:25.547 --> 21:30.534
Your mind is full of work and kids,
work and kids, work and kids.

21:30.610 --> 21:32.950
That leaves little for me.

21:32.989 --> 21:36.019
- I am trying to sell my business,
Jacques.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.591
- For months, ma chérie.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.355
But when?

21:39.432 --> 21:41.119
- I'm thinking of hiring Bob.

21:41.196 --> 21:42.999
- The babysitter?
- The butler.

21:45.645 --> 21:48.637
- The children will live with him?
I'm joking.

21:48.714 --> 21:51.130
- No, he'll live in the attic.

21:51.207 --> 21:53.047
We'll have a babysitter
wheneverwe want.

21:53.124 --> 21:55.809
- Perfect.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.184
Can you hurry up in there?

21:59.261 --> 22:01.256
You've been in there for hours.

22:01.332 --> 22:03.250
- Almost finished.

22:09.809 --> 22:11.841
- You'll tidy all this up?
- Yeah.

22:11.918 --> 22:14.066
- Bates, stop that!
- Ah!

22:14.142 --> 22:17.172
- It's a toilet bidet.
- What's a toilet bidet?

22:17.249 --> 22:21.046
- It's like a fountain for your ass...
- Ask me later.

22:21.123 --> 22:22.657
- Jack says he's here.

22:22.734 --> 22:23.999
- The butler!

22:24.076 --> 22:25.879
Now then, Robert—

22:25.956 --> 22:27.221
- Actually, my name's Bob.

22:27.299 --> 22:29.714
- Oh, well, Bob is short for Robert.

22:29.791 --> 22:31.709
- Isn't Rob short for Robert?

22:31.786 --> 22:33.474
- Yes.
- So then Bob

22:33.550 --> 22:34.892
would be short for Bobert.

22:34.969 --> 22:36.810
- Your name is Bobert?
- No.

22:36.887 --> 22:37.922
Just Bob.
- Okay, then.

22:37.999 --> 22:40.186
As long as we're satisfied
with first names,

22:40.262 --> 22:41.604
can we continue?
- Of course.

22:41.643 --> 22:43.331
Though I don't know your name.

22:43.369 --> 22:45.747
Is it all right if I call you
Mistress Jamieson?

22:47.357 --> 22:48.393
- No.

22:48.469 --> 22:50.157
That sounds rather sordid,
doesn't it?

22:50.234 --> 22:53.341
Perhaps you could
just call me Anne.

22:53.418 --> 22:54.952
- Anne.

22:55.029 --> 22:56.793
- Just Anne.

22:56.869 --> 22:58.059
- Anne.

22:58.136 --> 22:59.554
- Yes.

22:59.593 --> 23:01.012
Anne.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.584
- Et bien?
- Anne.

23:02.661 --> 23:06.419
- Mr. Tree, how many children
do you have?

23:06.496 --> 23:09.641
- Well, I don't have any children.

23:09.718 --> 23:10.792
- But you said in the flyer

23:10.869 --> 23:12.902
that you would take care
of the children like your own.

23:12.979 --> 23:14.973
- Yeah, if I had some.

23:15.011 --> 23:18.233
Ahem.
- But you did just recently attend

23:18.309 --> 23:20.151
the Cosmopolitan Butler School?

23:20.227 --> 23:21.646
- Is all tidy.

23:33.843 --> 23:35.799
- Uh, how much do I owe you?

23:46.922 --> 23:48.494
What did he say?

23:48.571 --> 23:50.681
- Uh, he said
he'll drop the bill off next week.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.936
- Um - ahem - Jacques

23:56.012 --> 23:57.431
got me a wonderful present:

23:57.508 --> 23:59.311
A state-of-the-art toilet.

23:59.387 --> 24:01.381
- A toilet?

24:01.458 --> 24:03.453
What a nice gift.

24:08.286 --> 24:10.356
- My goodness, Bob,

24:10.395 --> 24:13.118
I had no idea
that you were fluent in Japanese.

24:13.195 --> 24:14.729
- I worked in the Asian market.

24:14.806 --> 24:17.376
- Well, that's impressive.
- You sold stock?

24:17.453 --> 24:18.603
- Stalks,

24:18.679 --> 24:19.676
vegetables,

24:19.753 --> 24:21.786
some strangely shaped fruits.

24:24.164 --> 24:25.545
Horseshoe-shaped...

24:25.621 --> 24:26.926
fruits.

24:27.003 --> 24:30.876
- Uh, Bob, I would like
to go over a few specifics.

24:30.953 --> 24:32.756
I colour-categorize my sponges.

24:32.794 --> 24:34.673
- Hmm?
- Blue for bathroom, yellow for kitchen,

24:34.711 --> 24:37.741
purple for general,
green for the outdoors, car included.

24:37.818 --> 24:39.774
Please don't confuse them.
- Fine.

24:39.851 --> 24:41.923
- No strange women in the house.
- Fine.

24:41.999 --> 24:43.456
- No drugs. No pets.
- Fine.

24:43.533 --> 24:45.451
- You allergic?

24:45.489 --> 24:46.793
- They're unhygienic.

24:46.870 --> 24:48.136
- Fine.

24:55.845 --> 24:57.494
- So what do you think?
- He is very strange.

24:57.801 --> 25:01.330
I don't understand
this Rob-Bob-Bobert business.

25:01.406 --> 25:02.749
- Well, I suppose

25:02.826 --> 25:04.398
we could always interview
other candidates.

25:04.475 --> 25:07.466
- There are other candidates?
- No.

25:13.105 --> 25:15.023
I hired an assistant once.
She seemed perfect,

25:15.061 --> 25:17.477
she worked hard,
she did everything I told her to.

25:17.553 --> 25:20.507
One lunchtime,
I saw her in the gym.

25:20.583 --> 25:22.003
She had a shower

25:22.080 --> 25:25.416
and then changed right back
into herworkout bra.

25:26.490 --> 25:27.756
- I'm lost.

25:27.794 --> 25:30.594
- I fired her on the spot,
of course.

25:30.671 --> 25:31.668
- You fired her

25:31.745 --> 25:33.663
because of her sweaty bra?

25:33.739 --> 25:36.463
Do you think Bobert wears a bra?

25:36.539 --> 25:38.533
- Oh, who knows.

25:38.610 --> 25:40.451
But if it doesn't work out,
I'll change him.

25:40.490 --> 25:41.448
- Okay.

25:56.368 --> 25:58.516
- Ah... Bates!

26:00.012 --> 26:01.776
- Sorry, Mom.

26:03.273 --> 26:06.072
- I think you'll find
everything you need.

26:07.683 --> 26:10.368
I'm sure it's not up
to your professional standards.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.036
- It's...

26:19.075 --> 26:20.762
white.

26:20.838 --> 26:21.913
- Yeah.

26:23.370 --> 26:25.250
Oh, I'm sorry it is such a mess.

26:29.161 --> 26:32.306
I can indeed organize the world

26:46.536 --> 26:48.300
- Hey, Rascal.

26:52.481 --> 26:53.555
Home.

26:57.275 --> 26:58.541
We are robots!

26:58.618 --> 27:00.267
We are monster robots!

27:00.343 --> 27:02.031
I am Robot Man!

27:02.108 --> 27:05.100
Get out of my way.
I am Computer Man...

27:05.176 --> 27:08.168
- Aren't you a little old
to play with toys?

27:08.245 --> 27:10.891
- Well, I don't usually
play with them, but...

27:10.968 --> 27:13.615
I got these
when about your age and...

27:13.691 --> 27:17.373
I figured I'd give them
to my own son one day.

27:17.450 --> 27:19.790
- Didn't he want them?

27:30.873 --> 27:31.948
- Ahem.

27:32.792 --> 27:34.134
The children are in bed, ma'am.

27:34.210 --> 27:36.052
- Oh, thank you, Bob.
Music to my ears.

27:36.090 --> 27:38.200
- Is there anything else
I can do for you?

27:38.276 --> 27:40.578
- No. Thank you.
I'll see you in the morning.

27:42.073 --> 27:45.410
- I hope you don't mind,
but, um, I couldn't find any towels

27:45.487 --> 27:46.868
for your bathroom.
- Mm, no.

27:46.906 --> 27:48.402
I don't use them.

27:48.478 --> 27:49.975
- Okay, then.

27:50.051 --> 27:52.698
- They breed germs.
I have a body-dryer.

27:52.775 --> 27:54.538
- A body-dryer?
- Yes.

27:54.577 --> 27:56.226
- Like a hairdryer?

27:56.303 --> 27:57.645
- Bigger.

27:57.683 --> 27:59.793
Much more hygienic.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.095
Did I mention the sponge system?

28:02.171 --> 28:05.432
Blue for the bathroom...
- Purple, yellow, green.

28:05.508 --> 28:07.540
- Oh. Well, good night, then.

28:11.146 --> 28:12.373
- Good night.

28:34.044 --> 28:35.502
- What's that smell?
- Cooking.

28:35.578 --> 28:38.953
- Real food?
- Well, I guess Bob made us breakfast.

28:39.030 --> 28:41.254
Where did you get that blouse?

28:41.330 --> 28:44.015
- It's an old one.
- Yeah, like really old.

28:44.092 --> 28:48.312
Like five years tool old.
It's way too small for you.

28:48.388 --> 28:49.500
- Is not.
- Is.

28:49.577 --> 28:51.840
- Is not.
- Let's have Bob decide.

28:51.878 --> 28:52.990
Bob?

28:53.067 --> 28:54.180
- Is not.
- Is.

28:54.257 --> 28:56.558
- Yes, ma'am?
- Tess's blouse - indecently small,

28:56.635 --> 28:58.245
or acceptable fashion?

28:59.050 --> 29:00.432
- Sorry, Miss Tess.

29:08.486 --> 29:09.905
- That's a lot of pancakes.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.475
- It's more cost-effective
to prepare in bulk.

29:12.552 --> 29:13.510
- They teach you

29:13.587 --> 29:15.313
that bulk stuff at butler school?

29:15.390 --> 29:16.924
- Actually, at the finest...

29:19.532 --> 29:22.179
the finest cooking school
in the world.

29:22.255 --> 29:23.405
- The Cordon Bleu.

29:23.482 --> 29:25.247
- The U.S. Army.

29:25.285 --> 29:26.896
- The army? Cool.

29:26.973 --> 29:29.350
- Would you like some pancakes,
Miss Tess?

29:29.427 --> 29:31.844
- Sure, make me out on 50 pounds.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.378
That'll make me popular.
- Getting grounded

29:33.455 --> 29:36.523
for being rude
will definitely make you popular.

29:40.819 --> 29:44.347
- Miss Tess, I wanna prepare
a special dinner tonight.

29:44.424 --> 29:45.997
Sort of an introduction.

29:46.074 --> 29:48.106
What does your mother like?

29:48.182 --> 29:52.364
- She likes anything she can eat quickly
so she can get back to work.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.933
- You know what'd be good?
Aluau.

29:54.972 --> 29:57.157
She loves the whole Hawaiian thing.

29:57.234 --> 29:59.190
- A luau, huh?

29:59.267 --> 30:02.105
- Pork?
- Okay, I'll look into that.

30:04.675 --> 30:06.517
I knew a guy once,

30:06.593 --> 30:09.662
he was kind of a nervous fellow.

30:09.738 --> 30:10.812
Used to bite his nails.

30:10.889 --> 30:12.922
One day,

30:12.999 --> 30:14.992
he was so upset,
he ate his whole hand.

30:15.069 --> 30:16.565
- He did not.
- By the time

30:16.642 --> 30:19.557
we pulled him off, he'd chewed
all the way up to the elbows.

30:19.634 --> 30:23.009
- That is stupid.
- That fellow has to wear a muzzle now.

30:23.085 --> 30:24.351
A muzzle.

30:24.427 --> 30:27.419
All because he couldn't talk
about his problems.

30:28.839 --> 30:31.140
I don't know about that outfit,
Miss Tess.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.807
Are you getting out?

30:39.884 --> 30:42.722
- I've got basketball today.

30:42.799 --> 30:45.637
- That's great.
I love basketball.

30:45.714 --> 30:48.016
- You're not underfourfoot.

30:49.474 --> 30:50.509
Ah...

30:50.586 --> 30:52.465
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:55.534 --> 30:58.141
Guess what.
- You joined the Britney Spears

30:58.219 --> 31:00.519
fan club?
- My mom hired a butler.

31:00.557 --> 31:02.092
- He looks

31:02.169 --> 31:03.549
like he's from Transylvania.

31:03.626 --> 31:05.084
- He's not the only one.

31:06.426 --> 31:08.766
- They remind me
of the Addams Family.

31:10.261 --> 31:12.907
- Sad, sad, sad.

31:57.476 --> 31:59.202
- Helloooo.

32:01.234 --> 32:04.226
Hellooooo.

32:04.303 --> 32:05.531
Ahem.

32:08.292 --> 32:09.634
Nice melons.

32:09.672 --> 32:11.859
- Thank you.

32:11.936 --> 32:14.083
Nice cucumber.

32:14.159 --> 32:15.272
- Thanks.

32:17.651 --> 32:18.647
- You.

32:19.414 --> 32:21.562
You.

32:21.601 --> 32:23.749
- You.
- You.

32:23.826 --> 32:24.861
- You.

32:28.121 --> 32:29.348
- You.

32:31.956 --> 32:33.184
- You.

32:58.958 --> 32:59.994
- Ah!

33:01.221 --> 33:02.486
Ladies you're damn right

33:02.525 --> 33:04.213
Can't read a man's mind

33:04.289 --> 33:07.664
We're living in two tribes
and heading for war

33:07.741 --> 33:11.078
Whoo!
Nobody's perfect

33:11.154 --> 33:13.494
We all gotta work it
but fellas we're worth it

33:13.533 --> 33:16.448
So don't break the law
ah ah ah ah

33:16.524 --> 33:20.820
I'm just a love machine
feeding my fantasy

33:20.896 --> 33:22.239
Give me a kiss or three

33:22.316 --> 33:26.995
We just need a squeeze
instead of this negligee

33:27.033 --> 33:31.138
What will the neighbours think

33:31.214 --> 33:34.168
This time
come take my hand

33:34.244 --> 33:36.200
Understand that you can

33:36.276 --> 33:40.534
You're my man
and I need you tonight

33:40.611 --> 33:44.523
Come make my dreams
honey hard as it seems

33:44.600 --> 33:48.205
Loving me is as easy as pie

33:48.243 --> 33:49.931
I'm just a love machine

33:50.008 --> 33:54.994
Feeding my fantasy
give me a kiss or three

33:59.980 --> 34:01.208
Ooh, yeah.

34:03.661 --> 34:05.503
- Hi.
- How ya doin'?

34:05.580 --> 34:06.807
- Good.

34:08.610 --> 34:10.873
- Where's your sister?
- I don't know.

34:10.949 --> 34:13.213
Her cool friends
are very sensitive.

34:13.289 --> 34:15.590
- She have a lot of friends?

34:15.628 --> 34:18.658
- Compared to me,
or to normal people?

34:21.420 --> 34:23.146
- Tess said she'd rather die
than be collected

34:23.223 --> 34:25.063
by a man
who looks like a penguin.

34:26.368 --> 34:29.283
- I only take random insults
from immediate friends and family.

34:29.359 --> 34:30.663
- I'm Tess's best friend.

34:30.739 --> 34:31.737
- Good enough.

34:31.813 --> 34:33.348
Where is she?

34:33.425 --> 34:36.148
- Waiting for you to leave
over cover of nightfall.

34:36.225 --> 34:37.145
- Thank you.

34:38.565 --> 34:40.904
Miss Tess!

34:40.981 --> 34:42.016
Tess Jamieson!

34:42.092 --> 34:45.429
Your butler is here and waiting!

34:46.619 --> 34:47.846
Hurry up,

34:47.922 --> 34:50.378
or I'll throw out
yourfavourite Bamey video!

34:50.454 --> 34:51.873
And your stash of letters

34:51.949 --> 34:54.213
to one J. Timberlake!

34:59.621 --> 35:02.881
So how'd basketball go?
- I stunk.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.569
What's you expect?

35:04.608 --> 35:06.716
- I dunno.
What did you expect?

35:06.793 --> 35:08.673
- Well, I thought I'd be lousy.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.550
- Well, then it all worked out
the way you thought.

35:11.588 --> 35:13.275
Miss Tess, how was your day?

35:13.352 --> 35:15.960
- Do you gamble?
- What do you got in mind?

35:15.998 --> 35:18.300
- I bet you'll be fired
within a week.

35:18.376 --> 35:19.834
- What odds are you offering?

35:20.908 --> 35:25.127
Doesn't anyone want
to sit up front with the luau dinner?

35:39.816 --> 35:42.655
Dinner is served!

35:47.488 --> 35:50.326
- This is so perfect.
- You think she'll like it?

35:50.364 --> 35:52.243
- She'll be breathless.

35:52.282 --> 35:54.200
It's a napkin, moron.

35:55.542 --> 35:57.843
- Why the hurry?
- He made us all dinner.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.142
The least we can do
is show him a little gratitude.

36:04.133 --> 36:06.320
Oh, my good God.

36:06.396 --> 36:08.468
Aluau.

36:15.793 --> 36:17.212
Who's idea was this?

36:17.288 --> 36:18.861
- The butler.

36:33.896 --> 36:36.543
- One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi, five Mississippi,

36:36.620 --> 36:39.305
six Mississippi, seven Mississippi,
nine Mississippi, 10 Mississippi!

36:47.243 --> 36:49.047
- Mm, rich, full-bodied...

36:50.849 --> 36:53.112
Hmm, I smell a hint of mushroom.

36:53.188 --> 36:54.838
- Shitake?

36:54.915 --> 36:56.410
- Portobello. Burgundy region.

36:56.487 --> 37:00.054
I will take you there one day.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.087
- Can I come to Verdungy?

37:02.163 --> 37:04.848
- Oh, Bates, sweet,
but it's not for les enfants.

37:06.037 --> 37:09.144
I think it will be a trip
just for your mother and me.

37:09.220 --> 37:10.000
- Jacques is joking.
Heh-heh.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.599
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
- Jacques is joking.
Heh-heh.

37:11.599 --> 37:11.675
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:11.675 --> 37:14.360
Of course we can all go together.
The children would love it.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.360 --> 37:14.437
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.437 --> 37:17.045
- Ah, the children. Of course.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.045 --> 37:17.122
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.122 --> 37:18.848
- Can we go, Mom?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:18.848 --> 37:18.886
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:18.886 --> 37:21.072
Just the three of us?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.072 --> 37:21.149
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:21.149 --> 37:22.000
Jackass doesn't have to come.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.000 --> 37:22.913
Jackass doesn't have to come.

37:22.990 --> 37:24.179
- Jackass?

37:24.255 --> 37:26.979
Who is Jackass.

37:27.055 --> 37:29.779
- I think that Bates
has an imaginary friend.

37:31.352 --> 37:32.655
- Madam...

37:34.612 --> 37:36.184
kalua pu'a.

37:37.335 --> 37:40.097
The custom is to prepare the food

37:40.173 --> 37:41.937
in a an imu,

37:42.014 --> 37:44.468
or underground oven.

37:45.926 --> 37:47.192
- Sounds... wonderful.

37:47.268 --> 37:49.263
Doesn't it, children?

37:51.257 --> 37:53.290
Gross.

37:56.895 --> 37:58.047
- It is normally served

37:58.123 --> 37:59.695
with a mashed taro root,

37:59.772 --> 38:01.805
or poi.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.490
- God!

38:07.482 --> 38:10.090
- Plug it! Plug it up!

38:12.084 --> 38:14.347
Ah! Ahh!

38:14.423 --> 38:15.804
- Hot piggy! Hot piggy!

38:15.880 --> 38:17.223
Oh, Lord.

38:17.300 --> 38:18.872
Stay with me! Stay with me!

38:27.617 --> 38:30.379
- I cannot organize the world,
I cannot organize the world...

38:33.025 --> 38:34.675
Oh...

38:34.752 --> 38:37.858
- I think you'll find
that I just won the bet.

38:47.140 --> 38:49.364
- Moi. I'm the Jackass.
Jacques-ass.

38:49.441 --> 38:51.167
I'm not stupid, Anne.

38:51.244 --> 38:54.312
Is he not Bob-ass, this butler?

38:54.389 --> 38:56.729
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Here, let me help you.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.219
- Imbecile!

39:00.295 --> 39:03.019
But no, you do not want
to check his references!

39:06.049 --> 39:08.503
- I just wanted
to make a nice dinner.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.152
Sort of a thank-you?

39:10.229 --> 39:12.990
- Well, maybe if I talk to Mom.
Would that help?

39:13.067 --> 39:14.448
- Nah. I'm the screw-up.

39:14.487 --> 39:16.327
I've done this before.

39:16.404 --> 39:18.820
- You blew up another pig?

39:18.897 --> 39:20.163
- Bedtime, Bates.

39:21.965 --> 39:24.229
- Good luck.
- Can you give me one good reason

39:24.305 --> 39:26.031
why I shouldn't fire you right now?

39:26.107 --> 39:27.949
- Yes.
- Okay.

39:28.026 --> 39:29.330
I'm listening.

39:31.247 --> 39:32.629
- Can I have till tomorrow morning?

39:32.705 --> 39:35.735
- This is a complete disaster area!

39:35.812 --> 39:37.806
My pristine dining room

39:37.882 --> 39:40.452
is covered in pig shrapnel!

39:40.491 --> 39:42.677
- I'll clean it up.
- You better.

39:42.754 --> 39:44.403
- Every...

39:44.480 --> 39:46.129
shred.

39:47.433 --> 39:48.699
- Oh, and, Bob,

39:48.775 --> 39:52.304
I think it's best if you never, ever...

39:52.381 --> 39:54.567
ever cook anything again.

39:54.605 --> 39:56.984
- Yes, ma'am.

40:04.999 --> 40:06.419
Thought you should know—

40:06.495 --> 40:08.259
- Closed door, big hint.

40:08.297 --> 40:09.410
...I'm staying.

40:09.487 --> 40:12.134
- I thought servants were meant
to be seen and not heard.

40:17.694 --> 40:19.612
- Hey, these are great.
- Hey! Gimme that!

40:19.689 --> 40:22.681
It's private!
- Don't get your knickers in a knot.

40:30.850 --> 40:34.034
- Look, look, look, look, look,
look, look. Look.

40:37.025 --> 40:38.214
- Okay.

40:42.088 --> 40:44.312
Take your time today

40:44.351 --> 40:46.806
There's no hurry
you can wait a while

40:48.992 --> 40:50.641
If only for a smile

40:52.137 --> 40:54.246
Take your time today

40:54.324 --> 40:55.282
There's no hurry

40:55.359 --> 40:57.046
- All right!
- There you go!

40:57.084 --> 40:59.616
You can wait a while
Oh!

40:59.693 --> 41:01.687
If only for a smile
Oh! Jeez! Ahhh!

41:01.764 --> 41:03.029
- Sorry!

41:12.772 --> 41:15.687
So have you decided
Hmm? Uh-huh.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.911
To change your worn-out mind

41:17.949 --> 41:20.481
Then take your time today

41:20.558 --> 41:22.054
There's no hurry

41:22.131 --> 41:24.201
You can wait a while

41:25.697 --> 41:27.576
Hello?

41:27.653 --> 41:28.919
Hi, Mom.

41:28.957 --> 41:30.261
I'm in a tree.

41:32.179 --> 41:34.672
- Miss Tess.
- There you go.

41:36.551 --> 41:39.044
- Bates, there you are.
- Thanks!

41:39.121 --> 41:40.502
- Nice hat.

41:43.609 --> 41:45.373
Take your time today

41:47.636 --> 41:49.669
- Five in a row. Right back.

42:02.134 --> 42:04.436
- Shoot some balls with me?
- Sure.

42:08.731 --> 42:10.265
- What's that?
- What?

42:11.569 --> 42:13.449
- Have you got
a remote-control ball?

42:14.638 --> 42:15.788
- Rascal?

42:15.864 --> 42:18.051
- Who's Rascal?
- Rascal!

42:19.509 --> 42:20.583
Rascal!

42:25.261 --> 42:26.489
Rascal!

42:27.371 --> 42:28.982
Rascal!

42:31.936 --> 42:33.354
Rascal!

42:38.379 --> 42:40.526
Rascal!
- Bob!

42:41.946 --> 42:42.943
Bob!

42:43.979 --> 42:44.861
Bob!

42:45.973 --> 42:47.891
Bob, stop!

42:47.968 --> 42:49.616
- Rascal!

42:58.055 --> 43:00.548
- Poor thing.

43:00.624 --> 43:02.121
Someone's been
a very naughty butler.

43:09.906 --> 43:11.211
- Oh...

43:11.287 --> 43:13.626
Oh... Oh, Rascal.

43:13.703 --> 43:15.046
Rascal.

43:15.084 --> 43:18.306
"He licked the jar right out
of Newton's hand, sliming his palm

43:18.383 --> 43:20.799
"with a streak of black gob,

43:20.876 --> 43:24.136
"perhaps the most disgusting thing
Newton had experienced

43:24.213 --> 43:25.785
"since the time
he mistakenly ate a maggot.

43:25.861 --> 43:26.974
- Hi, guys.

43:27.051 --> 43:28.853
How was your day?

43:28.930 --> 43:30.273
Anything interesting happen?

43:31.308 --> 43:33.418
- The usual.

43:33.494 --> 43:35.796
- Oh.

43:39.439 --> 43:41.626
- Why aren't you a dad?

43:41.664 --> 43:43.390
- Just didn't happen yet.

43:43.466 --> 43:45.653
- I don't have a dad.

43:45.729 --> 43:47.416
- Everybody has a dad.

43:47.493 --> 43:49.756
- Mom got me and Bates
from a bank.

43:49.795 --> 43:51.483
- Tess.

43:51.521 --> 43:53.668
- Special bank
where men make deposits.

43:53.745 --> 43:56.506
- Tess...
- And women make withdrawals.

43:56.583 --> 43:59.268
- If they can't find Mr. Right.

44:15.991 --> 44:17.371
- Bob.

44:17.448 --> 44:18.523
Bob!

44:22.128 --> 44:24.468
- Too loud?
- Uh, no.

44:24.506 --> 44:27.459
No. Just, uh... just really...

44:27.536 --> 44:28.725
really horrible.

44:28.763 --> 44:29.837
Heh-heh.

44:29.913 --> 44:31.218
- I love the trumpet.

44:31.256 --> 44:33.020
- Then you should practice.

44:33.097 --> 44:34.670
- Yeah.

44:34.708 --> 44:36.280
- Um...

44:37.776 --> 44:41.343
Bob, you must... think
I'm a really horrible mother.

44:41.420 --> 44:44.220
- No.
- Well, it wasn't an easy decision.

44:44.296 --> 44:46.176
- Sure.

44:46.253 --> 44:49.360
- I just...
I didn't wanna miss out, you know?

44:49.398 --> 44:52.351
It's not like time
was exactly on my side,

44:52.428 --> 44:54.038
so I thought I'd...
- Anne...

44:56.148 --> 44:58.526
You're... you're blessed.

45:00.175 --> 45:01.786
Sorry. I, uh...

45:01.863 --> 45:04.088
spoke out of turn.

45:04.165 --> 45:06.811
Zip!
- That's all right.

45:06.888 --> 45:08.536
Thank you.

45:08.613 --> 45:10.570
- Can I ask you a question?

45:10.646 --> 45:12.180
- Yeah...

45:12.257 --> 45:14.366
- What's capital management?

45:18.738 --> 45:20.848
- Bye! Thanks for the lift!

45:20.925 --> 45:22.268
- See you later!

45:22.345 --> 45:23.725
Bye-bye!

45:30.015 --> 45:31.396
Hello, Judith.

45:31.435 --> 45:33.620
I'll be about an hour or so.

45:33.697 --> 45:35.385
It can wait.

45:35.461 --> 45:38.261
Yeah. I'll be on my cellphone
if you need me.

45:38.338 --> 45:39.565
Okay. Bye.

45:40.908 --> 45:42.902
Oh!

45:45.203 --> 45:47.045
Ah! Oh...

45:47.121 --> 45:50.918
Well, I can't come to a meeting
with stains on my blouse,

45:50.957 --> 45:52.337
now can I?

45:52.415 --> 45:54.408
I'm back, Bob!
I'm just gonna take a quick bath!

45:54.485 --> 45:56.096
I'll be there as soon as I can.

46:05.531 --> 46:08.983
I'll be over at 10
They tell me time and again

46:09.060 --> 46:10.440
I can't wait...

46:23.597 --> 46:27.240
Why do you build me up
Build me up

46:27.317 --> 46:28.582
Buttercup baby
- Ahhhhhh!

46:29.810 --> 46:30.960
...let me down...

46:34.335 --> 46:36.062
- Can I get you some towels,
ma'am?

46:36.138 --> 46:37.557
- Mm-hmm!

46:37.634 --> 46:39.552
But I love you still
I need you

46:39.628 --> 46:41.393
I need you
more than anyone darling

46:41.470 --> 46:43.157
You know that I have

46:43.195 --> 46:44.576
From the start

46:44.653 --> 46:46.570
So build me up

46:47.952 --> 46:49.179
Buttercup

46:50.330 --> 46:52.170
Don't break my heart

46:52.247 --> 46:54.280
- You don't get that flipping burgers.

46:58.154 --> 47:02.180
- Then I dribbled right, cut left
and slam-dunked it.

47:02.257 --> 47:06.017
- Who traded in my geek brother
for a jock geek brother?

47:06.093 --> 47:07.550
- Hey, where are you all going

47:07.627 --> 47:10.120
on a Sunday?
- Basketball tryouts.

47:10.197 --> 47:11.923
- Well, I'll drive you.
Let me get my purse.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.185
- I wanna go with Bob.

47:15.413 --> 47:17.292
- Okay. Uh...

47:17.369 --> 47:20.399
what about you, Tess?
- I arranged to meet Sophie.

47:20.437 --> 47:21.742
Don't you have work to do?

47:21.780 --> 47:23.813
- Nope. Amazingly.

47:25.615 --> 47:27.648
All right, well...
see you later.

47:33.593 --> 47:34.974
- Ah, oui, allô?

47:35.050 --> 47:37.160
Anne! What's wrong?

47:37.237 --> 47:40.765
- I got the whole day free
and I'm lonely!

47:46.595 --> 47:49.664
It's so nice to do something
for myself for a change.

47:49.740 --> 47:52.234
- We go out
and find a nice, quiet place.

47:52.310 --> 47:53.729
- Oh, this is lovely!

47:55.187 --> 47:57.105
This is nice!

47:57.182 --> 47:58.945
Now this is relaxing.

48:00.096 --> 48:01.324
This...

48:03.280 --> 48:05.274
Take me home.
- What?!

48:05.350 --> 48:07.614
- I... I... I can't be here
without them.

48:07.690 --> 48:09.953
I just can't enjoy... myself
without the kids.

48:10.030 --> 48:12.062
I mean, you know, I just can't!

48:12.139 --> 48:14.440
- Let's go!
- Look, Jacques, I have children.

48:14.479 --> 48:16.665
I love them.
They're not just going to disappear.

48:16.742 --> 48:18.161
- You would prefer
that I disappear?

48:18.237 --> 48:22.840
Examine the situation.
One: You are a single woman.

48:22.917 --> 48:23.876
Very beautiful,

48:23.952 --> 48:26.369
true, but, uh, very, very...

48:26.445 --> 48:27.827
anal.

48:29.054 --> 48:31.164
- Anal. I'm anal.

48:31.240 --> 48:33.196
- Two: Your children.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.837
They are not beautiful.
Just annoying.

48:39.294 --> 48:40.714
Three: If I go...

48:40.790 --> 48:43.092
- I'll take three. You go. Now.

48:43.169 --> 48:44.971
Take a cab.
- Anne!

48:45.047 --> 48:49.305
You are a single woman
of a certain age.

48:49.382 --> 48:51.107
You will not find another man.

48:51.146 --> 48:52.834
Statistically,

48:52.910 --> 48:56.017
you have a better chance
of being hit by a truck.

48:56.094 --> 48:58.817
One driven by Bob.

49:06.296 --> 49:07.754
- So?

49:07.830 --> 49:08.981
- So what?

49:09.057 --> 49:11.359
- How'd it go? The tryouts.

49:11.397 --> 49:13.084
- There was no tryouts.

49:13.124 --> 49:17.380
The coach had already decided
who was on the team.

49:17.457 --> 49:18.454
- What?

49:18.531 --> 49:19.989
That's not fair.

49:21.446 --> 49:22.750
Wait here.

49:22.827 --> 49:25.243
- You're not going to embarrass me?

49:25.320 --> 49:27.697
- You bet I am.

49:29.117 --> 49:31.188
Hey! You the coach?

49:31.264 --> 49:32.876
- Who's asking?

49:32.952 --> 49:34.870
- My name's Tree.

49:37.632 --> 49:38.974
- Bob?

49:39.051 --> 49:41.275
Bob the mascot?

49:41.314 --> 49:43.001
- Jerry?

49:43.077 --> 49:44.497
- Yeah!

49:44.574 --> 49:45.916
Rrrrrrr!

49:47.911 --> 49:49.061
- Yeah.

49:49.138 --> 49:51.094
What happened
to the Bismark Barbarians?

49:51.171 --> 49:54.546
- Ah, I left not long
after the owner fired you.

49:54.622 --> 49:56.540
He was a real a-hole.

49:56.579 --> 49:58.458
- I know. I know. I know.

49:58.534 --> 50:00.146
- Still got your helmet, though.

50:00.184 --> 50:02.102
You wanna see it?

50:02.179 --> 50:03.559
- You bet.

50:03.636 --> 50:05.400
It's about Bates.

50:05.439 --> 50:06.627
Bates Jamieson?

50:06.704 --> 50:07.816
- Pull up a chair.

50:12.917 --> 50:14.452
- Uh-ooh.
- Put it on.

50:18.977 --> 50:20.972
- Yeah. Still fits like a glove.

50:21.049 --> 50:22.966
Areally...

50:23.004 --> 50:24.616
weird glove.

50:24.692 --> 50:27.186
- It took them two hours
to remove that from his buttocks.

50:27.262 --> 50:28.988
- I probably shouldn't have
left it on his chair.

50:29.064 --> 50:31.596
Ahem.
- So what about the Jamieson kid?

50:31.673 --> 50:34.894
- He wants to try out for the team.

50:34.933 --> 50:37.771
- He's kind of small.

50:39.919 --> 50:42.604
Why is it impossible
to say no to you?

50:42.681 --> 50:44.291
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

50:44.369 --> 50:46.133
- Yeah! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

50:48.741 --> 50:50.159
All right.

50:50.198 --> 50:51.847
Go ahead.

50:57.792 --> 50:59.211
Come on, Bates!

50:59.288 --> 51:02.126
He's a little nervous.

51:02.164 --> 51:05.271
Put one in the net there, Bates!
Put one in the net there!

51:16.969 --> 51:18.159
How ya doin'?

51:18.236 --> 51:19.578
- Coach hates me.

51:19.654 --> 51:21.457
- Forget about him, okay?

51:21.534 --> 51:23.298
It's just you and me.

51:23.336 --> 51:24.756
Just like at home.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.213
Come on.

51:26.251 --> 51:28.284
Come on, let's go!
- Ah...

51:28.361 --> 51:29.549
- Come on!

51:29.626 --> 51:30.854
Like we practiced!

51:30.892 --> 51:32.196
Come on!

51:32.234 --> 51:34.881
- Hey.
- Oh, you got it, you got it.

51:34.919 --> 51:37.566
Take it around me,
take it around me,

51:37.604 --> 51:38.985
take it around me, put it in,

51:39.061 --> 51:40.404
put it in the net. Come on.

51:40.481 --> 51:43.243
No fancy stuff.
Just put it in the net.

51:44.661 --> 51:47.461
All right! Huh?! Huh?!
- Yeah! I got one!

51:47.499 --> 51:48.727
- Two points!

51:49.379 --> 51:50.798
Two points!

51:53.406 --> 51:54.634
Hey, Tess.

51:56.589 --> 51:58.124
Been shopping?

51:58.201 --> 52:00.387
Oh, what is that, a wristband?

52:01.384 --> 52:02.688
Pair of socks?

52:02.765 --> 52:04.644
Mom!
- Is it a bib?

52:04.721 --> 52:07.099
- Hey, how were the tryouts?
- Great!

52:07.176 --> 52:09.592
- Good. I made salmon skewers.
- Salmon?

52:09.669 --> 52:11.241
- I'll tell Tess.

52:11.318 --> 52:12.776
- What?

52:14.846 --> 52:16.649
- Hey, Tess.
- Don't come in.

52:16.726 --> 52:19.143
- Your mother made a barbecue.

52:19.219 --> 52:20.715
- I'll be down in five.

52:30.994 --> 52:33.026
- Would you like
to join us, Bob?

52:34.523 --> 52:36.286
Please.

52:36.363 --> 52:38.434
We'd like you to.

52:38.511 --> 52:41.081
- Thank you.

52:41.158 --> 52:43.153
It's real nice of you
to have made

52:43.229 --> 52:45.031
these salmon skewers.
Isn't it, kids?

52:46.451 --> 52:48.790
And a green salad.
Eh...

52:50.746 --> 52:53.584
- That was delicious.
- I should've made hot dogs.

52:53.623 --> 52:55.733
- No, no. It was really good.

52:55.809 --> 52:57.573
- Oh, you missed a spot.

52:57.650 --> 52:59.338
- Where?
- Right there.

52:59.414 --> 53:00.948
- Hmm.

53:01.025 --> 53:04.823
You know, Tess has drawn
some amazing dress designs.

53:04.861 --> 53:07.584
You should see her schoolbooks.
- Schoolbooks?

53:07.661 --> 53:10.384
- Yeah, she draws
in her schoolbooks.

53:10.423 --> 53:12.761
- You're such a liar!

53:12.838 --> 53:14.334
You're such a stupid liar!

53:14.411 --> 53:16.981
- Tess!
- It's not true!

53:17.058 --> 53:19.013
I hate you, Bob!
- Tess!

53:19.090 --> 53:21.200
Tess!

53:21.276 --> 53:24.460
- I guess that's what it's like
having family, Rascal.

53:24.498 --> 53:27.183
Ups and downs.

53:28.679 --> 53:30.098
Just a second.

53:35.544 --> 53:36.656
Come in.

53:38.114 --> 53:39.226
- Hi.

53:39.303 --> 53:42.026
I've spoken to Tess
and she's shown me her drawings.

53:42.103 --> 53:44.673
You're right.
They're amazing.

53:44.750 --> 53:47.013
So thank you for that.

53:50.349 --> 53:52.305
- Something wrong?

53:53.725 --> 53:56.103
- Don't take this
the wrong way, Bob.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.248
You're the butler.

53:59.324 --> 54:01.433
You're not herfather.

54:04.272 --> 54:06.880
- I understand completely.

54:09.066 --> 54:10.830
- Thanks.

54:12.595 --> 54:13.975
Good night, then.

54:14.052 --> 54:15.280
- Good night.

54:23.641 --> 54:25.213
- Why are we eating in here?

54:25.290 --> 54:27.515
- More coffee, ma'am?
- Oh, I'll get it.

54:27.591 --> 54:29.509
- Please, ma'am.
Leave it to me.

54:35.108 --> 54:37.180
- It's cool.

54:40.325 --> 54:42.013
- New skirt?
- Yeah. Like it?

54:42.051 --> 54:44.160
- No. It's like theirs.

54:44.237 --> 54:46.116
- That's the point, stupid.

54:47.075 --> 54:49.415
- So you coming to watch me
get my nose pierced?

54:49.492 --> 54:51.333
- Not on this planet.

54:51.410 --> 54:53.442
Tomorrow after school, okay?

54:55.973 --> 54:57.125
- Bye.

54:59.387 --> 55:02.187
- You're hanging
with the Clone Barbies now?

55:02.263 --> 55:03.185
- Maybe when I'm in tighter,

55:03.261 --> 55:05.830
I'll put in a good word for you
and you can hang with.

55:05.908 --> 55:08.630
- I liked you because I thought
you were an individual.

55:08.707 --> 55:10.050
Like me.

55:11.890 --> 55:14.690
Now you're just more like pathetic.

55:25.967 --> 55:27.040
- Stop!

55:27.885 --> 55:29.303
Excuse me.

55:30.876 --> 55:32.142
Kate, is the fruit washed?

55:32.218 --> 55:33.715
Judith, did you wash the fruit?

55:33.791 --> 55:35.402
- It's pre-washed.

55:35.478 --> 55:37.588
- Pre-washed? Pre-washed?!

55:37.665 --> 55:39.314
- Pre-washed.
- Ah!

55:42.843 --> 55:44.760
I do not wanna to lose this deal

55:44.837 --> 55:46.793
because one of my investors
has the runs!

55:46.870 --> 55:48.327
- The runs?

55:52.048 --> 55:53.428
- Done.

55:53.467 --> 55:54.540
Done.

55:55.730 --> 55:56.804
Done!

56:01.483 --> 56:03.630
Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

56:10.612 --> 56:12.644
Arodent!

56:12.720 --> 56:14.293
Oh! Rodent!

56:14.370 --> 56:15.981
Huge rodent!

56:16.020 --> 56:17.553
- Where is he?
- Oh! Oh!

56:17.630 --> 56:19.472
Huge!

56:19.548 --> 56:20.430
- Rascal?
- Rat! Ratty!

56:20.507 --> 56:22.348
- Rascal, don't do this to me.

56:22.387 --> 56:23.920
- Furry thing on the table!

56:23.997 --> 56:25.071
He was there on the table!

56:25.148 --> 56:27.334
- Hold it!
- Ah! What are you doing, Bob?

56:27.410 --> 56:28.715
- Don't move.

56:28.753 --> 56:30.210
- Ah... What are you doing, Bob?

56:33.164 --> 56:34.622
Ah... ah... ah...

56:34.698 --> 56:35.657
Ahhhh!

56:38.840 --> 56:40.105
- Rascal...

56:43.788 --> 56:45.207
- Oh, Jesus.

56:46.857 --> 56:48.237
I guess this is urgent?

56:48.275 --> 56:49.887
- Of course it's urgent!

56:49.963 --> 56:52.110
- Stay calm, Anne.
Do not explode.

56:52.187 --> 56:54.029
- Too late!
I've already exploded!

56:54.067 --> 56:55.908
I've dumped Jacques
and kicked out the hamster.

56:55.947 --> 56:57.289
- What hamster?
- Oh, keep up!

56:57.365 --> 57:00.204
Bob's taken over.
He spends more time with my kids—-

57:00.242 --> 57:03.617
- Than you do?
- Than butling. It's exasperating!

57:03.694 --> 57:04.960
- Have you fired him?

57:05.037 --> 57:06.992
- I told him the hamster
has to leave immediately

57:07.069 --> 57:08.603
and I want
this whole house disinfected

57:08.680 --> 57:09.945
from top to bottom!

57:10.000 --> 57:10.022
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:10.022 --> 57:12.362
- Oh, sounds like
someone has a crush.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.362 --> 57:12.400
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.400 --> 57:16.274
- Huh! I'm paying you for this?
I'm not paying you for this!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.274 --> 57:16.351
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.351 --> 57:18.920
Don't you dare bill me
for this call!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:18.920 --> 57:18.997
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:18.997 --> 57:20.915
Ridiculous!
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.915 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:26.285 --> 57:28.125
Oh, Rascal.

57:28.164 --> 57:30.657
Who let you out?

57:39.555 --> 57:41.857
You know what, Tess?
That was out of order.

57:41.895 --> 57:45.270
And if I was your father,
you would be in so much trouble.

57:45.347 --> 57:47.034
Ya dig?
- It wasn't me.

57:47.072 --> 57:48.492
- Yeah, whatever.

57:49.796 --> 57:51.062
- Whatever.

58:02.146 --> 58:03.987
- Bates...

58:04.064 --> 58:05.483
was it you?

58:07.669 --> 58:09.625
C'mon, Bates, why? C'mon.

58:09.702 --> 58:11.697
Talk to me, buddy.

58:14.765 --> 58:16.337
- I didn't make the team.

58:18.447 --> 58:19.866
- You didn't. Okay.

58:19.904 --> 58:21.324
That's a shame.

58:21.400 --> 58:24.622
- I didn't make the team!
You said I would!

58:24.699 --> 58:27.805
- Well, I never said that.
I said I would help.

58:27.882 --> 58:29.454
I said I would try.

58:30.912 --> 58:32.637
- I wasn't good enough.

58:32.714 --> 58:34.939
- Not being good enough is...

58:35.016 --> 58:36.857
life.

58:36.934 --> 58:39.427
But you'll find
you're good at something.

58:39.504 --> 58:41.382
Everybody's good at something.

58:41.459 --> 58:43.607
- What are you good at?

58:46.714 --> 58:48.364
- I can catch grapes
in my mouth.

58:58.067 --> 58:59.141
- Mom?

59:02.056 --> 59:03.935
I put Rascal in your room.

59:05.431 --> 59:07.387
I didn't make the team.

59:08.768 --> 59:10.149
- Okay.

59:10.226 --> 59:14.022
- It doesn't matter, though.
I'll find something to be good at.

59:39.259 --> 59:41.139
- Hello, Mr. Butler?

59:41.216 --> 59:42.443
Bob here.

59:57.516 --> 59:59.396
You'll look after him?

59:59.434 --> 01:00:00.623
- Of course.

01:00:00.699 --> 01:00:02.387
- Can I make you a cup of tea?

01:00:04.075 --> 01:00:06.568
- Oh, we have a regular little butler.

01:00:06.644 --> 01:00:08.831
What's your name,

01:00:08.869 --> 01:00:09.789
Master?

01:00:09.866 --> 01:00:11.746
- It's Bates.

01:00:11.784 --> 01:00:13.626
Just Bates.

01:00:14.929 --> 01:00:16.656
- Hmm...

01:00:23.252 --> 01:00:25.707
- You're gonna be just fine.

01:00:25.784 --> 01:00:28.276
- It's like an initiation thing.

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:34.682
- I'll start your room.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:43.196
How's everything going?

01:00:43.273 --> 01:00:45.536
- Fine, thanks!

01:01:02.719 --> 01:01:06.209
Let's go.
- You got the stuff?

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:07.436
- No problem.

01:01:09.431 --> 01:01:10.466
- Security!

01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:12.231
- Ah!

01:01:12.308 --> 01:01:13.841
No! Let me go!

01:01:13.919 --> 01:01:15.069
You guys, wait!

01:01:19.671 --> 01:01:21.321
- Purple. Purple for general.

01:01:21.398 --> 01:01:23.507
- What?
- Purple for general,

01:01:23.584 --> 01:01:25.194
yellow for kitchen,

01:01:25.271 --> 01:01:26.883
blue for bathroom.

01:01:26.959 --> 01:01:28.531
Purple for general.

01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:29.951
Right.

01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:35.512
- Hello?

01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:36.931
Hey, Bob!

01:01:37.008 --> 01:01:39.079
It's for you.

01:01:39.156 --> 01:01:41.265
- Hello.

01:01:41.342 --> 01:01:43.566
Jamieson family butler speaking.

01:01:45.676 --> 01:01:47.056
I'll be right there.

01:01:48.974 --> 01:01:50.778
I have to go.

01:01:50.854 --> 01:01:52.618
Will you be okay with Mr. Butler

01:01:52.695 --> 01:01:53.654
for a while?
- Sure.

01:01:56.223 --> 01:01:58.601
- Come on, Bates.
When we're finished here,

01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:02.436
I'll teach you how to polish silver
by spitting on it.

01:02:02.513 --> 01:02:03.588
- Cool!

01:02:03.664 --> 01:02:05.659
- Yeah!

01:02:09.034 --> 01:02:11.758
- Hey! I'm looking
for Tess Jamieson.

01:02:11.834 --> 01:02:14.480
- Tough love.
We give kids a dose of reality,

01:02:14.556 --> 01:02:16.590
scare 'em straight
before it's too late.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:18.163
- This one's not like that.

01:02:18.239 --> 01:02:19.083
- You're one of those

01:02:19.159 --> 01:02:20.963
always-looking-for-the-best
- in-people guys?

01:02:21.039 --> 01:02:23.340
Hmm! We'll keep her
for an hour or two,

01:02:23.416 --> 01:02:25.986
then you can take her.
- Listen, if I may be so bold,

01:02:26.063 --> 01:02:28.786
you'll let her out this second.
Or I'll call my friend Judge Sharma

01:02:28.863 --> 01:02:31.011
and I'll have your ass kicked
from here to Texas.

01:02:46.084 --> 01:02:48.923
Don't worry about it.
This'll be our little secret.

01:02:50.725 --> 01:02:52.106
- Bob, I'm sorry.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:54.484
About everything.

01:02:54.561 --> 01:02:56.900
I lied.

01:02:56.938 --> 01:02:58.243
About the luau.

01:02:58.281 --> 01:03:00.544
My mom's practically a vegetarian.

01:03:00.583 --> 01:03:02.231
- I guess she is now.

01:03:02.308 --> 01:03:03.651
Come on, let's go.

01:03:19.913 --> 01:03:21.332
- Omigod.

01:03:22.023 --> 01:03:23.020
Bates!

01:03:23.096 --> 01:03:24.668
- I'm standing still, Mom!

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:26.740
I can be a butler!

01:03:29.540 --> 01:03:31.611
- Good evening, Miss Jamieson.

01:03:41.353 --> 01:03:43.310
- Tess, where have you been?!

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.763
- I got hung up at Sophie's.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.027
Bob came and got me.

01:03:48.103 --> 01:03:48.985
- In that?!

01:03:49.023 --> 01:03:50.942
Both of you, inside now!

01:03:54.815 --> 01:03:57.308
Bob, I have known
for quite some time

01:03:57.385 --> 01:03:59.610
that you're not the world's
greatest butler,

01:03:59.648 --> 01:04:02.870
but you at least seemed
to care for my kids.

01:04:02.908 --> 01:04:04.405
What kind of a man

01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:07.281
leaves an eight-year-old
with a total stranger?

01:04:07.358 --> 01:04:09.658
A stranger...
What am I saying?

01:04:09.697 --> 01:04:10.848
A psycho!

01:04:10.925 --> 01:04:13.148
Who thinks that standing
on the roof of a house

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:15.028
is good training?

01:04:15.067 --> 01:04:16.831
- I'm sorry, Anne.

01:04:16.908 --> 01:04:18.212
- Miss Jamieson!

01:04:20.321 --> 01:04:22.546
- I'm truly sorry, Miss Jamieson.

01:04:25.307 --> 01:04:26.957
- I have to let you go, Bob.

01:04:28.337 --> 01:04:30.638
I'll pay you
to the end of the month, but...

01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:33.745
I want you to leave in the morning.

01:05:43.052 --> 01:05:44.547
- Let's not get ourselves down,

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:45.852
Rascal.

01:05:45.928 --> 01:05:47.615
You keep going...

01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:50.032
and I'll keep going.

01:05:53.062 --> 01:05:56.860
- To the end
of ATBJ Capital Management!

01:05:56.937 --> 01:05:58.355
Finally!

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.150
Okay...

01:06:05.757 --> 01:06:07.790
- I don't feel like celebrating.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:21.752
- Come in.

01:06:21.828 --> 01:06:23.669
Why aren't you in school?
- Lunch.

01:06:23.746 --> 01:06:24.973
What are you doing?

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:26.660
- Lunch.

01:06:26.737 --> 01:06:29.460
Welcome to my home.

01:06:29.537 --> 01:06:30.880
- Nice.

01:06:30.957 --> 01:06:33.565
- Well, my natural state is messy.

01:06:33.642 --> 01:06:36.287
- I'm sorry you got fired.
I just wanted

01:06:36.365 --> 01:06:37.784
the cool kids to like me.

01:06:39.932 --> 01:06:43.230
- You know, when I was a kid,
I used to like building model cars.

01:06:44.572 --> 01:06:46.260
But...

01:06:46.299 --> 01:06:47.679
there was always once piece

01:06:47.756 --> 01:06:49.942
I could neverfigure out
where it was supposed to go.

01:06:50.019 --> 01:06:52.359
I always felt like that piece.

01:06:53.816 --> 01:06:56.692
I've spent my whole life
trying to figure out where I fit.

01:06:56.730 --> 01:06:59.377
So when you figure it out...

01:06:59.415 --> 01:07:00.604
well...

01:07:00.682 --> 01:07:02.100
that's good.

01:07:03.557 --> 01:07:05.782
- So you're saying
it's good to shoplift

01:07:05.859 --> 01:07:07.777
if it helps you fit in?

01:07:10.155 --> 01:07:12.456
- I worked
for a New York designer once.

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:15.026
- You?
- I was just sewing,

01:07:15.064 --> 01:07:17.557
but it was better
than a lot of jobs I've done.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.360
Here.

01:07:19.437 --> 01:07:21.431
Severance pay
from the sweatshop.

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.535
- Bob...

01:07:25.612 --> 01:07:28.028
can you teach me how to sew?

01:07:39.994 --> 01:07:42.526
- Sorry for skipping out on you.
- Yeah, we were, like,

01:07:42.602 --> 01:07:43.945
so cowardly.

01:07:43.984 --> 01:07:45.326
- This is ace.

01:07:45.402 --> 01:07:47.129
D'you steal it?

01:07:47.205 --> 01:07:49.430
- I made it.
- Shut up!

01:07:49.507 --> 01:07:51.769
I want one.
- Me too!

01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:54.186
- Than wouldn't we be wearing
the same top?

01:07:54.224 --> 01:07:56.794
- Yeah. Like a club.

01:08:02.547 --> 01:08:03.966
- Hey, Soph.

01:08:12.749 --> 01:08:14.169
- I had the best day.

01:08:14.245 --> 01:08:15.242
- Great.

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:17.966
- He followed me.

01:08:18.004 --> 01:08:20.420
- I want to be good at something.
- Well, of course you do.

01:08:24.562 --> 01:08:26.442
You ever seen
one of these before?

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:27.861
Check, check, check, check.

01:08:27.937 --> 01:08:28.897
- Check, check.

01:08:28.935 --> 01:08:30.890
Check, check.
- Does it look all right?

01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:32.118
- Wicked.

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:35.187
- I hope you're ready.
- Oh, God.

01:08:35.264 --> 01:08:36.759
- It's show time.

01:08:36.836 --> 01:08:38.639
Thank you for coming,
ladies and...

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:39.674
just lady.

01:08:39.751 --> 01:08:42.243
I am pleased to present

01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:45.312
original creations by Tess!

01:08:47.805 --> 01:08:51.526
Be a cool girl
Like you were meant to be

01:08:51.564 --> 01:08:54.402
In a stunning outfit
of skirt and top retro-"chick. "

01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:56.934
That's our Sophie!

01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:58.850
- Chic, not chick.

01:08:58.928 --> 01:09:00.194
- Whatever.

01:09:00.232 --> 01:09:01.651
And next up,

01:09:01.728 --> 01:09:03.645
the twin evil girls.

01:09:03.721 --> 01:09:05.064
Oh!

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.288
Whoo! Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:09:08.171 --> 01:09:09.551
- And finally,

01:09:09.629 --> 01:09:12.006
the heroine of the hour,

01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:14.001
the one and only...

01:09:14.078 --> 01:09:15.344
Miss Tess!

01:09:46.104 --> 01:09:47.714
- Miss Jamieson.

01:09:47.791 --> 01:09:50.054
- Yeah,
I was just in the neighbourhood.

01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:54.657
I wasn't, obviously.

01:09:54.734 --> 01:09:56.153
I came to see you.

01:09:57.611 --> 01:09:59.566
- Come on in.
- Ahem...

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:07.429
- Here we are.

01:10:11.456 --> 01:10:12.876
She's very talented.

01:10:12.952 --> 01:10:15.369
- You've been so good with them.

01:10:16.251 --> 01:10:17.669
But I know the truth.

01:10:18.821 --> 01:10:21.351
- I just helped her
make a few dresses.

01:10:21.429 --> 01:10:25.648
- You got my little girl out of jail.

01:10:25.686 --> 01:10:28.217
I got a phone call this morning
from a Detective Alvarez.

01:10:29.866 --> 01:10:32.820
He said that he wished
that half the fathers that he met

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.661
were as loyal
and determined as you.

01:10:34.738 --> 01:10:37.192
- Don't be too hard on her.

01:10:37.269 --> 01:10:39.455
- I think you know me
better than that.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.373
- I do.

01:10:41.449 --> 01:10:44.709
- So what's next for you?
- Well, I got a job.

01:10:44.786 --> 01:10:47.241
One of those butler cruises.

01:10:47.318 --> 01:10:50.348
Around the world in 365 days.

01:10:52.573 --> 01:10:53.991
- That's good for you.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:55.488
When do you leave?

01:10:55.564 --> 01:10:57.405
- First thing Saturday.

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:01.049
- Oh, um... these...

01:11:01.126 --> 01:11:03.350
are... for tomorrow.

01:11:05.459 --> 01:11:06.763
- Oh, wow.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:07.953
I love the trumpet.

01:11:08.029 --> 01:11:10.293
- Yeah. Jacques and I
were supposed to go,

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:12.938
but, uh, I thought
maybe you had someone special.

01:11:14.473 --> 01:11:15.968
- No.

01:11:20.993 --> 01:11:23.716
- Well, I guess we, uh...
we each could take one.

01:11:23.754 --> 01:11:25.096
- Sure.

01:11:28.434 --> 01:11:30.658
- Okay, then.

01:11:30.735 --> 01:11:31.809
- Okay.

01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:34.379
- Okay, well,
I'll see you there, then.

01:11:35.376 --> 01:11:37.255
Eight o'clock tomorrow.
- Okay.

01:11:44.351 --> 01:11:46.191
It's not a date.

01:11:46.268 --> 01:11:48.071
- It's a date.
- Is not.

01:11:48.148 --> 01:11:50.334
- Is.
- Oh... it's not a date.

01:11:50.411 --> 01:11:53.633
A date, huh!
Just two people.

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.896
Two individual people who...

01:11:55.973 --> 01:11:58.773
happen to be going to the same place
at the same time.

01:11:58.849 --> 01:12:01.956
All I did was give Bob
my extra ticket.

01:12:02.033 --> 01:12:03.413
- It's so a date.

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:06.903
- Who's going on a date?
- Mom. With Bob.

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.246
- Awesome!

01:12:15.303 --> 01:12:16.377
- Hello.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.793
What are you doing
at this moment?

01:12:26.081 --> 01:12:27.385
Oh...

01:12:27.461 --> 01:12:29.494
- I'm taking care of my family.

01:12:29.571 --> 01:12:32.754
I'm a single woman
of a certain age, remember?

01:12:32.831 --> 01:12:35.055
- Ah, tonight, we have those, uh...

01:12:35.132 --> 01:12:36.628
tickets to the concert.

01:12:36.666 --> 01:12:39.390
- Bye, Jacques.
- You will not use them.

01:12:39.466 --> 01:12:41.883
You would not go alone.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.953
Are you going alone?

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:46.677
- Are you jealous,
my little Jacques... ass?

01:12:46.715 --> 01:12:47.828
- Who is he?

01:12:47.905 --> 01:12:49.208
Who is he?!

01:12:49.246 --> 01:12:51.510
Robert.

01:12:51.548 --> 01:12:53.005
- Robert...

01:12:55.076 --> 01:12:56.342
Bobert...

01:12:57.953 --> 01:12:59.448
Bob?

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:04.627
- It's just a night out
with a beautiful woman...

01:13:04.665 --> 01:13:06.353
who's stolen my heart.

01:13:14.215 --> 01:13:15.826
I've got a doorbell, you know.

01:13:18.933 --> 01:13:21.656
- We're here to help.
Let's see what you've got.

01:13:21.733 --> 01:13:24.188
- Could you have knocked
a little more, maybe?

01:13:24.265 --> 01:13:26.028
- Ugly...

01:13:26.105 --> 01:13:27.985
ew... no...

01:13:28.023 --> 01:13:29.403
tragic...

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.670
ew...

01:13:30.746 --> 01:13:32.625
gross... no.

01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:35.847
What's wrong with this?

01:13:35.924 --> 01:13:38.225
- Kind of bored of suits, you know?

01:13:38.263 --> 01:13:39.645
- It's perfect.

01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:41.255
What time is the concert?

01:13:41.293 --> 01:13:43.480
- Doesn't take me long
to get ready.

01:13:43.557 --> 01:13:44.975
- Maybe it should.

01:13:52.608 --> 01:13:55.638
- Oh, hello, sir.
Can I help you?

01:13:55.715 --> 01:13:58.285
- This is the Cosmopolitan
Butler School?

01:13:58.362 --> 01:14:00.087
- It is no more.

01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:02.810
- It is closing?

01:14:02.887 --> 01:14:04.652
- I'm afraid so.

01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:07.337
Not enough filthy lucre
to keep it alive.

01:14:07.413 --> 01:14:09.024
- So...

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.747
you trained the great Bob.

01:14:12.936 --> 01:14:14.508
- What about Bob?

01:14:14.585 --> 01:14:17.193
- Five-day course.

01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:18.152
Mon Dieu!

01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:20.453
You are not a professional!

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:22.793
Just a sad British man

01:14:22.870 --> 01:14:26.475
with his sad little tradition.

01:14:26.552 --> 01:14:28.355
So...

01:14:28.432 --> 01:14:30.925
now we have Bob the liar, too.

01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:32.803
- If I may say so...

01:14:32.842 --> 01:14:34.300
sir...

01:14:34.377 --> 01:14:37.176
Bob Tree
is a finer man than most.

01:14:37.253 --> 01:14:40.437
And it has been an honour
to know him.

01:14:40.513 --> 01:14:42.584
- Bob!

01:14:47.148 --> 01:14:48.260
- Wow.

01:14:48.337 --> 01:14:49.642
- Mom, is that you?

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:52.902
- I'll take that as a compliment,
I think.

01:14:52.978 --> 01:14:55.395
Now don't stay up too late.

01:14:55.472 --> 01:14:57.849
You sure it's not too much?
- You're a hottie.

01:14:57.925 --> 01:15:00.342
- That's a good thing, right?
It's not too risqué?

01:15:00.419 --> 01:15:03.334
- If you've got it, flaunt it.
That's what I always say.

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:04.715
- You better not say that.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:08.358
Good night.

01:15:33.519 --> 01:15:34.938
- You're early.

01:15:38.045 --> 01:15:39.425
- Yes, I am.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:12.640
- Hi.

01:16:14.097 --> 01:16:16.629
- You look... radiant.

01:16:17.627 --> 01:16:18.854
- Huh...

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:21.922
you said it yourself.
I have a very talented daughter.

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:42.595
- Yeah, I couldn't believe it.
- Whoa. Ticket, please, sir.

01:16:42.672 --> 01:16:44.974
- Oh, I have my... my...
my ticket, it's in there.

01:16:45.012 --> 01:16:46.124
Bob has it.
- Bob who?

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.885
- Uh-uh-uh, Bob has my ticket.
Bob. Bob.

01:16:50.688 --> 01:16:52.376
Oh...

01:16:52.452 --> 01:16:53.679
Ah...

01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.282
- Forget it.
- Oh, come on.

01:17:29.387 --> 01:17:30.960
- It's like a dream, isn't it?

01:17:44.461 --> 01:17:46.110
- You wanna go backstage?

01:17:46.187 --> 01:17:48.296
- I don't think we're allowed.

01:17:48.373 --> 01:17:50.099
- All right, follow me.

01:17:52.516 --> 01:17:54.702
- Bob! Yeah!

01:17:54.779 --> 01:17:56.006
- Euh...

01:17:56.082 --> 01:17:58.230
- How ya doin'?
- Bob? Bob!

01:17:58.307 --> 01:18:00.800
- Mama Clara!
She fired me.

01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.331
- You sure we can do this?

01:18:03.408 --> 01:18:04.444
Ooh.

01:18:04.521 --> 01:18:06.399
- Bob, is that you?
- Vince.

01:18:07.244 --> 01:18:08.624
Come on, Anne.

01:18:08.701 --> 01:18:10.427
- How ya doin'?
- Good. How are you?

01:18:10.466 --> 01:18:11.692
- Ahem.
- Good to see you.

01:18:11.769 --> 01:18:14.032
- I want you to meet
a friend of mine,

01:18:14.109 --> 01:18:15.374
Anne Jamieson.
- Charmed.

01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:16.756
- The pleasure's mine.

01:18:16.794 --> 01:18:19.671
- You know, a few of us
are going out for something to eat.

01:18:19.747 --> 01:18:22.202
Would you and your date
like to, uh, go with us?

01:18:22.279 --> 01:18:25.040
- Well, she's not a date.
- Uh, we'd love to.

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:26.306
- Fantastic.
- We'd love to...

01:18:26.382 --> 01:18:29.029
- I... I saw them go back there.

01:18:29.106 --> 01:18:30.563
- Who?
- Oh, Bob. Bob.

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.903
Are you... are you deaf?
- Huh!

01:18:32.979 --> 01:18:34.476
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

01:18:34.552 --> 01:18:37.237
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:18:44.562 --> 01:18:46.442
Oh!

01:18:46.519 --> 01:18:48.053
Oh!
- Whoa.

01:18:48.129 --> 01:18:51.428
- You seem like you know
everyone in the whole city.

01:18:51.504 --> 01:18:53.844
- Yeah. Well, I've been fired a lot.

01:18:56.721 --> 01:18:59.406
- It was a wonderful evening.
- Oh, Anne, your dress.

01:18:59.444 --> 01:19:00.364
- Oh!
- Your dress.

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.896
Oh, your dress.
- Ah! Oh!

01:19:02.973 --> 01:19:04.468
Aha...
- Oh, jeez.

01:19:04.546 --> 01:19:07.959
- Did you and Tess plan this?
- Yeah, I...

01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:10.606
I did teach her to sew.

01:19:10.644 --> 01:19:12.868
- Laugh! But not for long.

01:19:12.944 --> 01:19:14.786
If I weren't a gentleman,

01:19:14.863 --> 01:19:16.051
I would kill you right now.

01:19:16.128 --> 01:19:18.429
- Oh, Jacques!
This isn't any of your business!

01:19:18.506 --> 01:19:20.731
- It is my business.

01:19:20.807 --> 01:19:24.681
Put some clothes on!
- Don't you tell me what to do.

01:19:24.758 --> 01:19:27.979
I'll... run around stark naked
if I want to.

01:19:28.056 --> 01:19:31.508
- Anne, you have been fooled.
He is not a proper butler.

01:19:31.585 --> 01:19:35.114
- Maybe I should just go.
- Oh, you think you can just sneak away?

01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:36.456
Afterwhat you did?

01:19:36.494 --> 01:19:39.524
You cannot take advantage
of a middle-aged woman!

01:19:39.601 --> 01:19:42.516
- Oh! I am not middle-aged!

01:19:42.593 --> 01:19:44.166
Am I?

01:19:44.204 --> 01:19:45.508
- You're beautiful.

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:48.768
- And I'm going to hire Bob.

01:19:48.844 --> 01:19:53.217
- To do what?!
He trained for five days! Five!

01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:55.096
Cinq!
- You were gonna hire me?

01:19:55.173 --> 01:19:57.283
- I... I... I...
Well, you really care

01:19:57.359 --> 01:19:59.814
for my children
and they adore you.

01:19:59.891 --> 01:20:02.000
- Ah, Anne!
This situation is intolerable!

01:20:02.076 --> 01:20:04.455
- No, this situation is fine.

01:20:04.493 --> 01:20:05.951
You are intolerable.

01:20:08.367 --> 01:20:09.786
- C'est fini?

01:20:09.863 --> 01:20:10.000

01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:25.166
- I can't.

01:20:25.243 --> 01:20:27.506
- I don't understand.

01:20:27.583 --> 01:20:28.925
- It wouldn't be appropriate.

01:20:42.234 --> 01:20:43.768
- Aren't you going after him?

01:20:45.111 --> 01:20:47.296
- He's leaving
first thing in the morning.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:05.016
Get up, Mom.

01:21:05.093 --> 01:21:08.008
- Tess, what are you doing?
- Why did you work this hard, Mom?

01:21:09.504 --> 01:21:11.191
You're all alone.

01:21:11.268 --> 01:21:12.726
- Mom,

01:21:12.803 --> 01:21:15.411
he's part of our family.

01:21:23.656 --> 01:21:24.884
- Stay here.

01:21:24.961 --> 01:21:25.996
- Go, Mom!

01:21:26.073 --> 01:21:27.531
Go, Mom!

01:21:27.608 --> 01:21:29.180

01:21:46.018 --> 01:21:48.510
Go, Mom! Go, Mom!

01:21:51.771 --> 01:21:53.151
- What happened?

01:21:57.025 --> 01:21:58.636
- That happened.

01:22:00.822 --> 01:22:03.085
That's the butler cruise.

01:22:04.543 --> 01:22:06.268
- You mean Bob left?

01:22:14.323 --> 01:22:15.627
- What a mess!

01:22:15.665 --> 01:22:17.008
A real mess!

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:21.763
It's a real mess.

01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:25.293
- Maybe he'll come back.

01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:27.363
- Get tidy, Anne.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.745
Get tidy.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.858
I'm sorry, kids. We lost Bob
and it's all my fault.

01:22:43.665 --> 01:22:45.122
But I wanna thank you -

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.502
both.

01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:48.650
I love you so much.

01:22:48.727 --> 01:22:50.108
Both of you.

01:22:52.025 --> 01:22:53.866
Please don't look at me like that.

01:23:00.617 --> 01:23:02.726
They say kids bounce back,
but...

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:14.348
Bob!

01:23:17.186 --> 01:23:19.755
Bob!
- Hi.

01:23:19.832 --> 01:23:21.520
- What about the butler cruise?

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:23.246
- I couldn't leave.

01:23:23.323 --> 01:23:25.048
Thought I'd stay.

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:27.618
- Car-washing?
- Well, it's early on

01:23:27.695 --> 01:23:28.999
in the Cs.

01:23:51.935 --> 01:23:53.009
Hey!

01:23:54.007 --> 01:23:55.847
This is a song

01:23:55.924 --> 01:23:59.030
About my desire to find work

01:23:59.452 --> 01:24:02.405
My desire to find a family

01:24:02.482 --> 01:24:04.630
- For the food
we are about to receive

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:07.123
and for my new dad, Bob,

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.312
we thank you, God.
- Amen.

01:24:08.389 --> 01:24:09.540
Amen.

01:24:09.617 --> 01:24:12.647
- Oh, honey, why don't I carve?

01:24:12.723 --> 01:24:13.797
- Ahem-hem.

01:24:13.874 --> 01:24:16.444
That's a gentleman's job. Ma'am.

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.005
Check it

01:24:25.073 --> 01:24:26.876
- Not again!

01:24:26.953 --> 01:24:28.640
Oh. Nooooo!

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.167
- Dinner is served.

01:24:35.084 --> 01:24:37.615
My name is Bob
I'm looking for a job

01:24:37.654 --> 01:24:39.993
When I'm not getting fired
I'm living like a slob

01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:42.410
Go through the phonebook
looking for work

01:24:42.487 --> 01:24:45.287
I want to be an astronaut
like Captain Kirk

01:24:45.363 --> 01:24:47.204
Flip burgers
to make me a buck

01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:49.429
Burn down the restaurant
is just bad luck

01:24:49.505 --> 01:24:52.152
I got another occupation
under my belt

01:24:52.228 --> 01:24:54.415
Keeping a job for two weeks
I'm doing well

01:24:54.453 --> 01:24:56.179
Like the time
at the barbershop

01:24:56.255 --> 01:24:58.864
Gave it all I got
chopped up an earlobe

01:24:58.940 --> 01:25:01.127
He bled a lot
He never said a lot

01:25:01.203 --> 01:25:04.464
He just screamed and got blood
on my brand new blue jeans

01:25:04.540 --> 01:25:06.880
Oh golly gee did it again

01:25:06.957 --> 01:25:09.450
I talked to my hamster
my only friend

01:25:09.488 --> 01:25:11.520
Go through the phonebook again
like a fool

01:25:11.597 --> 01:25:14.397

01:25:36.144 --> 01:25:38.484
When to the school
it was like no other

01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.900
They made me balance
plates on my head yeah

01:25:40.939 --> 01:25:43.278
They made me make a naked dude
get dressed

01:25:43.355 --> 01:25:45.694
He dressed me up in a suit
and a vest

01:25:45.732 --> 01:25:48.072
Took me to the rooftop
for a test

01:25:48.149 --> 01:25:50.489
Made me climb to the edge
real slow

01:25:50.565 --> 01:25:52.867
Looked at the ground
and I got vertigo

01:25:52.944 --> 01:25:55.130
I thought about a woman
that I met the other day

01:25:55.207 --> 01:25:57.507
And the vertigo stopped
spinning it went away

01:25:57.584 --> 01:25:59.924

Living in the attic

01:26:27.117 --> 01:26:29.304
Take the dust to dust
I attack this

01:26:29.342 --> 01:26:31.835
