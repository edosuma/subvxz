00:49.260 --> 00:50.327
Gerald Tate's here.

00:50.395 --> 00:51.729
He wants to know
what's happening to his deal.

00:51.797 --> 00:53.264
Go get Harvey.

00:54.793 --> 00:58.793
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

01:03.080 --> 01:05.715
I check.

01:05.783 --> 01:06.949
Raise.

01:07.017 --> 01:09.151
5,000.

01:09.219 --> 01:11.219
I'm all-in.

01:18.227 --> 01:20.761
You can pay me later.
I got to go.

01:21.721 --> 01:23.155
Gentlemen.

01:24.657 --> 01:26.826
I'm paying you millions,

01:26.893 --> 01:28.494
and you're telling me
I'm gonna get screwed?

01:28.561 --> 01:31.230
Jessica, have I come
at a bad time?

01:31.298 --> 01:35.501
Gerald, this is
Harvey Specter.

01:35.569 --> 01:36.895
He's our best closer.

01:36.896 --> 01:37.804
Well, if you're
the best closer,

01:37.805 --> 01:39.406
where the hell you been
for the last three hours?

01:39.474 --> 01:42.775
Well, Gerald, I specialize
in troubled situations,

01:42.776 --> 01:43.909
and when I left here
at 7:00 p.m.,

01:43.977 --> 01:45.812
this deal wasn't
in jeopardy,

01:45.880 --> 01:47.380
so I'm just trying to figure out
what happened in the interim.

01:47.448 --> 01:48.749
We keep offering more money.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.250
They keep rejecting it.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.985
It's last-minute
bad faith bullshit.

01:52.053 --> 01:54.021
Says here that Cooper
won't be staying on

01:54.089 --> 01:56.190
as honorary vice president.

01:56.258 --> 01:58.091
That's right.
I don't want him around.

01:58.159 --> 01:59.159
He wouldn't be around.

01:59.227 --> 02:00.461
It's an honorary position.

02:00.529 --> 02:01.662
I don't give a shit.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.530
Well, I think you do,

02:03.598 --> 02:05.365
because that's what's changed
since I left,

02:05.433 --> 02:07.800
which means it's you
who's been dealing in bad faith.

02:07.868 --> 02:10.002
Well, now that you've got
a grasp on what's happened

02:10.070 --> 02:11.570
in the goddamn interim,

02:11.638 --> 02:13.305
what are you
gonna do about it?

02:13.373 --> 02:14.973
Because he's not getting
that title.

02:15.041 --> 02:18.344
Well, let me make sure
I understand this, okay?

02:18.411 --> 02:20.946
We negotiated a deal that
gave you everything you wanted,

02:21.014 --> 02:23.750
Mr. Cooper signed it,
and now you won't close

02:23.817 --> 02:25.618
until we take away
the last shred of his dignity?

02:25.686 --> 02:27.788
- Bingo.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.

02:27.855 --> 02:30.090
- And why the hell not?
- Because I like Mr. Cooper,

02:30.158 --> 02:32.426
and my firm doesn't operate
in bad faith.

02:32.494 --> 02:35.329
Oh.
I see how it is.

02:35.397 --> 02:36.564
Instead of working Cooper,

02:36.632 --> 02:38.833
you're working me.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.235
Well, why don't you take
your pansy attitude

02:41.303 --> 02:43.838
back in there
and make him sign my deal?

02:43.906 --> 02:45.573
Or I'll pay someone else
your money

02:45.641 --> 02:48.109
to do it for me.
First of all, Gerald,

02:48.177 --> 02:49.944
if you think
anyone's gonna touch this deal

02:50.011 --> 02:52.880
after your bad faith,
you're mistaken.

02:52.947 --> 02:56.316
Second, the way
our agreement works is,

02:56.384 --> 02:57.951
the minute Cooper
signed the deal

02:58.019 --> 02:59.519
which gave you everything
you wanted,

02:59.587 --> 03:02.556
our fee was due and payable,
which is why at 7:30

03:02.623 --> 03:05.626
I received confirmation
of a wire transfer

03:05.694 --> 03:08.729
from escrow indicating payment
in full.

03:15.104 --> 03:16.605
So I'd say
the ball's in your court,

03:16.673 --> 03:19.207
but the truth is
your balls are in my fist.

03:19.275 --> 03:22.677
Now I apologize if that image
is too pansy for you,

03:22.745 --> 03:24.112
but I'm comfortable enough
with my manhood

03:24.179 --> 03:25.446
to put it out there.

03:25.514 --> 03:27.081
Now get your ass in there

03:27.149 --> 03:30.184
and close the goddamn deal.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.952
You gonna let him talk to me
like this?

03:32.019 --> 03:34.354
Harvey speaks for the firm.

03:48.002 --> 03:50.971
We got paid
before Gerald signed the deal?

03:51.038 --> 03:52.405
What are you talking about?
This is a memo

03:52.473 --> 03:54.074
about some fire drill
on Tuesday.

03:54.142 --> 03:55.742
- Huh.
- You're the blue team captain.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.645
You get to wear a fire hat.

04:11.625 --> 04:13.725
Time's up.

04:13.793 --> 04:16.161
Pencils down.

04:16.228 --> 04:18.997
Excuse me.
Do I know you from somewhere?

04:19.065 --> 04:20.933
I don't think so.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.904
I have a pretty good memory
for faces.

04:23.971 --> 04:27.073
So do I.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.643
- Sorry.
- I got it.

04:42.623 --> 04:44.823
Hey.
Hey!

04:44.891 --> 04:46.325
Stop! You in the cap!

05:19.325 --> 05:21.326
What did you get me?

05:21.394 --> 05:22.928
What I said
I was gonna get you.

05:22.996 --> 05:25.997
A 158.
I told you I wanted a 175.

05:26.065 --> 05:27.299
And I told you
only 1 out of 100 people

05:27.366 --> 05:29.234
can score that.

05:29.301 --> 05:32.237
You're a B-minus student.
You got 1,000 on your SATs.

05:32.305 --> 05:33.873
If I get you a 175,
they'll know you cheated.

05:33.940 --> 05:36.775
So only a genius loser
can get a 175?

05:36.843 --> 05:39.311
Actually, no.
I would get a 180.

05:39.379 --> 05:41.747
Now can I have my money,
please?

05:47.754 --> 05:50.155
Whoa.
This is only half.

05:50.223 --> 05:51.657
Then why don't you
go call the police?

05:55.662 --> 05:59.165
I got to get my shit
together.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.167
That's the best cheeseburger
I've had in my life.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.705
It's from Monday, Trevor.

06:04.773 --> 06:06.006
Look, man, I'm serious.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.608
I almost got caught today.

06:07.676 --> 06:09.076
I've got
to stop getting stoned.

06:09.144 --> 06:10.377
I've got to get
my act together.

06:10.445 --> 06:11.912
Dude, look at me.

06:11.980 --> 06:14.415
You can burn bud
and still be a success.

06:14.483 --> 06:16.084
You sell pot for a living.

06:16.151 --> 06:18.052
Still saps the motivation.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.754
All I'm saying is,
you want in,

06:20.822 --> 06:22.222
you are in.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.224
You know,
that is word for word

06:24.292 --> 06:26.126
your offer before I got caught

06:26.194 --> 06:28.261
cheating on your math test
in the third grade.

06:28.329 --> 06:29.329
Goddamn memory.

06:29.397 --> 06:31.097
Stop.

06:31.165 --> 06:33.299
Look, no one's gonna suspect
you're a dealer.

06:33.367 --> 06:34.300
I mean, look at me.

06:34.368 --> 06:36.168
This is a $2,000 suit, Mike.

06:36.236 --> 06:37.636
I got, like, 12 of 'em.

06:37.704 --> 06:39.405
I take on
real software projects.

06:39.473 --> 06:44.110
I have clients who bring me
briefcases filled with cash,

06:44.178 --> 06:45.678
and I hand them
identical briefcases

06:45.746 --> 06:47.147
with vacuum-sealed bud.

06:47.215 --> 06:48.949
So what do you need me for?

06:49.017 --> 06:51.219
Well, I have a client
coming in from out of town,

06:51.287 --> 06:52.854
and I can't meet him,

06:52.922 --> 06:55.824
and I need someone I can trust
to make the drop.

06:55.892 --> 06:57.426
It's totally safe.

06:57.493 --> 06:59.161
Trevor, a person
is more likely to die

06:59.228 --> 07:00.595
while dealing drugs
than they would be

07:00.663 --> 07:02.863
on death row in Texas.

07:02.931 --> 07:04.331
Wait.
What are you talking about?

07:04.399 --> 07:05.666
It's from <i>Freakonomics.</i>

07:05.734 --> 07:06.833
Do you read anything
that I give you?

07:06.901 --> 07:08.702
It doesn't matter,

07:08.770 --> 07:10.337
because you have to find
somebody else.

07:10.404 --> 07:11.571
I'm not interested.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.740
Not interested in what?

07:13.807 --> 07:14.974
What are you doing here?
You said you were gonna stay

07:15.042 --> 07:15.975
at your place tonight.

07:16.043 --> 07:17.743
Hi, sweetie.

07:17.811 --> 07:19.212
What a pleasant surprise.

07:19.280 --> 07:21.114
I'm so glad you stopped by.
Yeah.

07:21.182 --> 07:22.349
We're in the middle
of something.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.384
What are you
in the middle of?

07:24.452 --> 07:26.253
Trevor's trying
to set me up.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.621
That's terrific.

07:27.689 --> 07:29.457
Who's the lucky girl?

07:29.524 --> 07:31.326
I'm trying to get him
to work for me.

07:31.393 --> 07:33.195
That's a great idea.

07:33.262 --> 07:34.729
It will take some stress
off Trevor,

07:34.797 --> 07:35.798
and you'll pick up
writing code

07:35.865 --> 07:37.767
like you do everything else.

07:37.834 --> 07:39.268
All right.
I got to go.

07:39.336 --> 07:41.003
I got go get up early
to see my grandmother

07:41.070 --> 07:42.104
and pay them another month.

07:42.172 --> 07:43.672
Oh.

07:45.574 --> 07:46.574
- Good night.
- Bye.

07:49.378 --> 07:52.146
How did you know Gerald
wouldn't look at that memo?

07:52.213 --> 07:54.214
Because a charging bull
always looks at the red cape,

07:54.282 --> 07:55.749
not at the man
with the sword.

07:55.816 --> 07:57.884
By the way,
I've set up a meeting

07:57.951 --> 08:00.086
for you and John Dockery
next week.

08:00.154 --> 08:01.588
Dockery?
He's Skadden's biggest client.

08:01.655 --> 08:02.656
Not anymore.

08:02.723 --> 08:04.491
He's looking around.

08:04.559 --> 08:05.826
He plays tennis.
I want you to close him.

08:05.894 --> 08:07.261
Consider it done.

08:07.329 --> 08:10.298
Then you are
officially dismissed

08:10.366 --> 08:12.167
for the evening.

08:12.234 --> 08:13.835
Cheers.

08:13.903 --> 08:14.903
Well, you two seem
to be celebrating something.

08:14.971 --> 08:17.239
Mm-hmm.
We are.

08:17.307 --> 08:18.808
In fact, you are looking

08:18.876 --> 08:20.109
at the best closer
this city has ever seen.

08:20.177 --> 08:21.411
Closer, huh?

08:21.478 --> 08:22.811
Baseball?
Attorney.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.313
I close situations.

08:24.381 --> 08:26.216
Hmm.
So you only care about money?

08:26.283 --> 08:28.051
The truth is,
I do it for the children.

08:29.988 --> 08:31.555
I'm Lisa.

08:31.623 --> 08:32.857
Harvey.

08:32.924 --> 08:35.927
Lisa, I don't normally do this,

08:35.995 --> 08:37.595
but since we are celebrating,

08:37.663 --> 08:39.496
what time do you get off
tonight?

08:39.565 --> 08:41.499
I'm glad you asked.

08:41.567 --> 08:45.804
I get off at ten past
"I'm never going out with you."

08:48.375 --> 08:52.477
I guess you're not the best
closer this city's ever seen.

08:55.815 --> 09:03.588
♪ ♪

09:06.426 --> 09:07.926
Good morning.

09:07.994 --> 09:09.561
Lisa, this was lovely,

09:09.629 --> 09:11.330
but I'm afraid
you have to go.

09:11.398 --> 09:13.065
- Aw.
- I hate to miss a workout,

09:13.133 --> 09:15.367
and I really need
to be in the office by 7:30.

09:15.435 --> 09:17.636
I can make you breakfast?

09:17.704 --> 09:19.138
You could eat it
off my stomach.

09:19.205 --> 09:20.405
I guess if I skip the gym,

09:20.473 --> 09:22.374
I can still get in by 9:00.

09:33.953 --> 09:36.855
I hear someone's
not taking their pills.

09:36.923 --> 09:39.524
Because they're trying
to poison me.

09:39.592 --> 09:41.726
Grammy, that's crazy.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.194
Dr. Shrager gave me her word

09:43.261 --> 09:45.695
she wouldn't poison you
until January.

09:45.763 --> 09:47.297
If she does it before then,
she can't count it

09:47.365 --> 09:49.499
towards next year's quota.

09:52.002 --> 09:54.670
Oh, what did I teach you?

09:57.874 --> 10:01.376
Michael, I'm not gonna be
around forever.

10:01.444 --> 10:06.815
And I want you to stop
with that stuff.

10:06.883 --> 10:08.116
What stuff?

10:08.184 --> 10:10.685
I may be old,

10:10.753 --> 10:12.621
but I'm not an idiot.

10:12.689 --> 10:14.824
I know life has been hard
for you,

10:14.891 --> 10:16.325
but you're not a kid anymore,

10:16.393 --> 10:18.094
and I want you to promise

10:18.162 --> 10:20.497
you're gonna start living up
to your potential.

10:26.037 --> 10:27.771
I promise.

10:31.076 --> 10:33.044
I'm not saying that I haven't
been charmed by Harvey,

10:33.112 --> 10:34.879
but it's just so patronizing

10:34.947 --> 10:36.615
when you say
that he can handle those things

10:36.682 --> 10:38.149
and, "Louis,
you can only handle this."

10:38.217 --> 10:40.051
Jessica, I could have handled
Gerald Tate.

10:40.118 --> 10:41.385
And I told you
I disagree.

10:41.453 --> 10:43.287
- Why?
- Because when you put

10:43.355 --> 10:44.622
two bullies
in the same room together,

10:44.689 --> 10:46.623
things generally
don't go so well.

10:46.691 --> 10:48.091
It's 9:30.
Nice of you to show up

10:48.159 --> 10:49.959
two hours after we open
for business.

10:50.027 --> 10:51.994
And I see that you're also
trying to look like a pimp.

10:52.062 --> 10:54.863
My bad, Louis.
I was out late last night.

10:54.931 --> 10:55.797
And when I woke up,
this is the suit

10:55.865 --> 10:57.132
your wife picked out for me.

10:57.200 --> 10:58.767
And that would be funny

10:58.835 --> 11:00.569
if I'd actually been married.
Moving along.

11:00.637 --> 11:02.738
- You're not married?
- Recruiting. Harvey.

11:02.806 --> 11:04.440
Your interviews are set up
for tomorrow.

11:04.508 --> 11:05.942
What?
Why don't we just hire

11:06.010 --> 11:07.811
the Harvard summer associate
douche?

11:07.879 --> 11:09.980
I think if you listen
to the phrasing

11:10.048 --> 11:11.983
of that question,
you'll come up with an answer.

11:12.051 --> 11:13.785
We need people who think
on their feet,

11:13.853 --> 11:15.353
not another clone
with a rod up his ass.

11:15.421 --> 11:17.322
Harvey, the fact
that we only hire from Harvard

11:17.390 --> 11:19.257
gives us a cache
that's a little more valuable

11:19.325 --> 11:20.858
than hiring a kid
from Rutgers.

11:22.361 --> 11:24.629
You went to Harvard Law.

11:24.697 --> 11:26.531
I'm an exception.

11:26.599 --> 11:28.132
Find me another one.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.967
Can we please skip
the recruiting?

11:30.035 --> 11:31.669
I work better alone anyway.

11:31.736 --> 11:33.270
Well, I would, Harvey,

11:33.338 --> 11:35.306
except all senior partners
get an associate.

11:35.373 --> 11:37.174
It's just a rule.

11:37.242 --> 11:39.843
I'm sorry.
What?

11:39.911 --> 11:41.111
Jessica, I deserve
that promotion.

11:41.179 --> 11:42.879
My billables destroy his.

11:42.947 --> 11:45.348
And I'm here night and day
doing whatever's needed

11:45.416 --> 11:46.950
instead of swanning
in and out of here

11:47.018 --> 11:48.686
whenever I please.

11:48.753 --> 11:51.155
I must admit, he does make me
sound very swan-like.

11:51.222 --> 11:52.256
Harvey,

11:52.324 --> 11:54.124
shut up.

11:54.192 --> 11:57.061
Louis, this is how it is.

11:57.129 --> 12:00.398
All right,
now you two make nice.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.900
Louis, I apologize.
I was out of line.

12:02.968 --> 12:06.670
Now if you'll just let me text
your pretend wife

12:06.738 --> 12:09.941
that I just made senior partner,
I--what?

12:10.008 --> 12:11.942
Your grandmother's
getting worse.

12:12.010 --> 12:13.877
I need to move her
to full care

12:13.945 --> 12:15.912
or I'll have to transfer her
to the state facility.

12:15.980 --> 12:17.881
I won't put her
in a state facility.

12:17.949 --> 12:20.383
Then I'm afraid you'll have
to come up with $25,000.

12:22.820 --> 12:24.787
Trevor, I'm in.

12:24.855 --> 12:27.190
One-time deal.
I want 25.

12:27.257 --> 12:28.258
Take it or leave it.

12:28.325 --> 12:29.492
I'll take it.

12:29.560 --> 12:30.626
There's a briefcase in my room.

12:30.694 --> 12:31.794
Pick it up tomorrow,

12:31.862 --> 12:33.496
take it to room 2412

12:33.564 --> 12:34.963
at the Chilton Hotel.

12:35.031 --> 12:36.598
Now you can't go
to a luxury hotel

12:36.666 --> 12:38.467
looking like a delivery guy,
so shave,

12:38.534 --> 12:40.368
comb your hair,
buy a suit.

12:40.436 --> 12:42.103
That's a hell
of a lot to ask, man.

12:42.171 --> 12:44.538
Well, I'm not asking you.
I'm paying you $25,000.

12:44.606 --> 12:45.573
Okay?

12:45.641 --> 12:48.442
Yeah, he's in.

12:48.509 --> 12:49.810
Good.

12:49.877 --> 12:51.978
I'm gonna go take a piss.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.119
Key.

12:59.187 --> 13:00.321
24 hours, we'll know

13:00.388 --> 13:02.422
if this new buyer's a cop.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.724
Why didn't you tell Trevor
he might be sending

13:03.792 --> 13:05.292
his guy into a setup?

13:05.360 --> 13:06.293
Same reason
why I don't tell Gina

13:06.361 --> 13:07.528
I'm banging her sister.

13:07.596 --> 13:10.197
It'll only cause trouble.

13:10.265 --> 13:11.566
What's up?

13:11.634 --> 13:13.235
I'm just gonna take off.

13:13.302 --> 13:16.238
I don't think you should.

13:16.306 --> 13:18.274
Why don't you stay with us
till tomorrow?

13:18.341 --> 13:20.209
Now give me your cell phone.

13:20.276 --> 13:21.677
Give me your phone.

13:21.744 --> 13:26.013
Don't even think
about warning your boy.

13:26.081 --> 13:28.549
'Cause if these guys are cops,
whoever's holding that weed

13:28.617 --> 13:30.417
is going to jail
for a long time.

13:36.090 --> 13:37.591
Hey.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.559
Hey. God, you scared the hell
out of me.

13:39.627 --> 13:40.594
Sorry.

13:40.662 --> 13:44.765
Look at you.

13:44.833 --> 13:46.367
You look great.
Thanks.

13:46.435 --> 13:47.936
Tell me you decided
to work with Trevor.

13:48.003 --> 13:50.772
Yeah.
Trial basis. Yeah.

13:52.977 --> 13:54.644
What are you doing here?

13:54.712 --> 13:57.347
My mom is coming
by my place later.

13:57.415 --> 13:58.482
And I don't want
to mess it up,

13:58.549 --> 14:00.417
so I'm hanging here.

14:00.485 --> 14:02.452
Got to go.

14:02.520 --> 14:05.155
Hey.
Come here.

14:07.325 --> 14:09.526
Mm.

14:09.594 --> 14:11.528
You want to look perfect
on your first day.

14:11.596 --> 14:13.397
Yeah.

14:18.469 --> 14:20.037
I've got to go.

14:21.639 --> 14:22.906
Mm-hmm.

14:38.390 --> 14:40.491
Great. Thanks.

14:40.559 --> 14:43.528
Donna, we're gonna need
to streamline this.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.363
Give each guy a hard time.

14:45.431 --> 14:46.932
Before you send them back,

14:47.000 --> 14:48.533
give me a wink
if they say something clever.

14:48.601 --> 14:50.269
Cool?
Okay.

14:50.336 --> 14:51.336
What are you looking for?

14:51.404 --> 14:53.605
Another me.

15:17.096 --> 15:19.564
So, Chip,

15:19.632 --> 15:21.466
what makes you think

15:21.533 --> 15:23.067
that I'm gonna let
the whitest man

15:23.135 --> 15:25.269
that I have ever seen
interview for our firm?

15:25.337 --> 15:28.172
Because I have
an appointment.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.808
Hmm.

15:55.502 --> 15:56.970
You can do this.

16:12.218 --> 16:13.852
Kid, what is wrong with you?

16:13.919 --> 16:15.186
You look
like you're 11 years old.

16:15.254 --> 16:17.255
I was late to puberty.

16:20.592 --> 16:22.160
Harvey Specter.

16:47.389 --> 16:49.124
Uh, excuse me.

16:49.191 --> 16:51.259
I was thinking
about going for a swim.

16:51.327 --> 16:52.561
Are the pool facilities here
nice?

16:52.629 --> 16:53.796
Of course, sir.

16:53.863 --> 16:56.899
This is the Chilton Hotel.

16:59.569 --> 17:01.003
And do you have the time?

17:01.071 --> 17:04.071
Yes, uh...

17:04.140 --> 17:07.241
10:00.
Thanks.

17:11.246 --> 17:12.746
- He saw your gun.
- You think that's him?

17:18.986 --> 17:20.454
Matches the description.

17:20.521 --> 17:22.189
But he didn't go
in the room.

17:22.257 --> 17:23.156
It's 10:00 exactly.
He's just walking by?

17:27.430 --> 17:29.264
Go after him.
Stay on the radio.

17:50.389 --> 17:53.557
Rick Sorkin.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.960
Rick Sorkin.

17:58.897 --> 18:00.097
Rick Sorkin?

18:00.165 --> 18:02.366
Excuse me, Mr. Sorkin,

18:02.434 --> 18:03.901
you are five minutes late.

18:03.969 --> 18:05.636
Is there a reason
why I should let you in?

18:08.206 --> 18:10.241
Look, I'm just trying
to ditch the cops, okay?

18:10.308 --> 18:12.977
I don't really care
if you let me in or not.

18:21.319 --> 18:22.519
Mr. Specter will be
right with you.

18:22.587 --> 18:24.987
What?

18:25.055 --> 18:28.890
Can I get you anything?
A coffee or a bottle of water?

18:31.160 --> 18:32.961
Hi, Rick Sorkin.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.929
Harvey Specter.
Nice to meet you.

18:34.997 --> 18:37.432
Why don't you have
a seat here?

18:37.499 --> 18:39.601
Whoa.
What's this?

18:46.843 --> 18:47.776
Can I help you?

18:47.844 --> 18:50.246
No.

18:52.616 --> 18:55.351
How the hell did you know
they were the police?

18:55.419 --> 18:57.787
I read this novel
in elementary school,

18:57.855 --> 18:59.189
and it was
the exact same thing.

18:59.256 --> 19:01.891
You read a novel
in elementary school.

19:01.959 --> 19:04.160
What?
I like to read.

19:04.228 --> 19:06.595
And why'd you ask them
what time it was?

19:06.663 --> 19:07.963
Throw 'em off.

19:08.031 --> 19:09.331
What kind of drug dealer

19:09.399 --> 19:10.999
asks a cop
what time it is

19:11.067 --> 19:12.801
when he's got a briefcase
full of pot, right?

19:12.868 --> 19:15.136
We should hire you.

19:15.204 --> 19:16.938
Jesus, I'd give you
the 25 grand

19:17.005 --> 19:18.206
as a signing bonus.

19:18.273 --> 19:19.641
I'll take it.

19:19.708 --> 19:21.410
Unfortunately,

19:21.477 --> 19:23.045
we only hire
from Harvard.

19:23.112 --> 19:26.382
And you not only did not go
to Harvard Law School,

19:26.449 --> 19:28.584
you haven't even gone
to any law school.

19:28.652 --> 19:31.054
What if I told you
that I consume knowledge

19:31.121 --> 19:32.322
like no one you've ever met,

19:32.389 --> 19:34.257
and I've actually passed
the bar?

19:34.325 --> 19:37.661
I'd say
you're full of crap.

19:37.729 --> 19:40.364
That's a Barbri legal handbook
right there, right?

19:40.432 --> 19:41.999
Open it up.
Read me something.

19:42.067 --> 19:45.069
Anything.

19:48.439 --> 19:51.408
"Civil liability associated
with agency is based

19:51.475 --> 19:53.843
on several factors--"
"including the deviation

19:53.910 --> 19:55.411
"of the agent
from his path,

19:55.479 --> 19:57.379
"the reasonable inference
of agency on behalf

19:57.447 --> 19:58.513
"of the plaintiff,
and the nature

19:58.581 --> 20:01.316
of the damages themselves."

20:01.384 --> 20:03.385
How did you know that?

20:03.453 --> 20:07.257
I learned it when I studied
for the bar.

20:07.324 --> 20:11.161
Okay, hotshot,

20:11.229 --> 20:13.097
fire up this laptop.

20:13.165 --> 20:15.833
I'm gonna show you

20:15.901 --> 20:18.336
what a Harvard attorney
can do.

20:18.404 --> 20:21.539
Pick a topic.

20:21.607 --> 20:23.208
Stock option backdating.

20:23.275 --> 20:25.176
Although backdating options
is legal,

20:25.244 --> 20:27.912
violations arise
related to disclosures

20:27.980 --> 20:31.048
under IRC Section 409a.

20:31.116 --> 20:33.217
You forgot
about Sarbanes-Oxley.

20:33.285 --> 20:34.752
The statute of limitations

20:34.819 --> 20:37.354
renders Sarbanes-Oxley moot
post 2007.

20:37.422 --> 20:39.223
Not if you can find actions

20:39.290 --> 20:40.991
to cover up the violation

20:41.059 --> 20:44.662
as established in
the Sixth Circuit, May 2008.

20:44.730 --> 20:47.732
That's impressive, but you're
sitting at a computer.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.834
Playing hearts.

20:50.902 --> 20:53.604
Sorry.
If you want to beat me,

20:53.671 --> 20:55.339
you're gonna have to do it
at something else.

20:55.407 --> 20:57.207
How can you know
all that?

20:57.275 --> 20:58.742
I told you.
I like to read.

20:58.810 --> 21:01.612
And once I read something,
I understand it.

21:01.679 --> 21:04.815
And once I understand it,
I never forget it.

21:04.882 --> 21:06.450
Why take the bar?

21:08.353 --> 21:10.254
This dickhead bet me
I couldn't pass it

21:10.322 --> 21:11.455
without going to law school.

21:14.226 --> 21:16.127
Okay, look,

21:16.194 --> 21:18.329
this is
all pretty fascinating stuff,

21:18.396 --> 21:20.498
but I'm afraid
I got to get back to work.

21:20.565 --> 21:23.100
I'll make sure
that Serpico isn't around

21:23.168 --> 21:25.102
waiting for you.

21:38.616 --> 21:40.484
You want this job so much,

21:40.551 --> 21:42.385
why didn't you just go
to law school?

21:42.453 --> 21:44.787
When I was in college,

21:44.855 --> 21:46.355
it was my dream
to be a lawyer.

21:46.423 --> 21:48.824
I needed some money,

21:48.892 --> 21:50.025
and Trevor convinced me

21:50.093 --> 21:52.094
to memorize this math test

21:52.161 --> 21:56.163
and to sell it.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.332
Turns out we sold it
to the Dean's daughter.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.835
I lost my scholarship,
I got kicked out of school,

22:00.902 --> 22:05.573
I...

22:05.641 --> 22:09.044
I got knocked
into a different life.

22:09.111 --> 22:12.413
And I have been wishing
for a way back ever since.

22:16.186 --> 22:17.987
Let me tell you something.

22:18.054 --> 22:20.690
This isn't elementary school.
This is hard work.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.692
Long hours.
High pressure.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.862
I need a grown goddamn man.

22:24.929 --> 22:26.931
You give me this,

22:26.998 --> 22:28.933
and I will work
as hard as it takes

22:29.001 --> 22:30.635
to school those Harvard douches

22:30.703 --> 22:32.470
and become the best lawyer
you have ever seen.

22:32.538 --> 22:34.907
I'm inclined
to give you a shot,

22:34.974 --> 22:36.442
but what if I decide
to go another way?

22:36.510 --> 22:38.778
I'd say that's fair.

22:38.845 --> 22:40.212
Sometimes I like to hang out
with people

22:40.280 --> 22:41.981
who aren't that bright,
you know,

22:42.048 --> 22:43.148
just to see
how the other half lives.

22:43.216 --> 22:45.450
Move over.

22:45.518 --> 22:48.319
I'm emailing the firm
I just found our next associate.

22:53.558 --> 22:55.493
All right.
You're gonna start a week

22:55.494 --> 22:56.167
from Monday.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.383
Here's what you're gonna do.

22:57.384 --> 22:59.218
First, no more pot.
We drug test.

22:59.974 --> 23:01.295
Stop smoking now,
you'll be fine,

23:01.296 --> 23:02.763
I assume that's all the drugs
you do.

23:02.847 --> 23:04.548
- How do you know that?
- You read books, I read people.

23:04.970 --> 23:07.205
And potheads smoke pot.
That's what they do.

23:07.273 --> 23:09.074
It's not all I do.
I have interests.

23:09.141 --> 23:10.542
You're Albert
friggin' Einstein,

23:10.610 --> 23:12.211
and you couldn't manage
to get into law school?

23:12.279 --> 23:13.546
You think that's not
from smoking weed?

23:13.613 --> 23:14.914
- Trevor got--
- That's another thing.

23:14.981 --> 23:16.324
You're never gonna talk
to Trevor again.

23:16.325 --> 23:17.566
You're gonna ditch
that briefcase,

23:17.567 --> 23:19.129
and you're gonna get on a plane
to Harvard,

23:19.130 --> 23:20.506
and you're gonna learn
everything there is

23:20.507 --> 23:21.541
about going
to law school there.

23:21.892 --> 23:23.343
- Did you buy that suit?
- Yeah.

23:23.344 --> 23:25.045
Let's buy some new ones.

23:32.197 --> 23:35.666
Hi.

23:35.734 --> 23:38.235
How do I sign up
for today's law school tour?

23:38.302 --> 23:40.437
You go back in time
six weeks

23:40.505 --> 23:41.872
because
that's when it booked up.

23:41.940 --> 23:43.574
Um...

23:43.642 --> 23:45.943
This is Harvard Law.

23:46.011 --> 23:48.046
We get over 7,000 applications
a year.

23:48.114 --> 23:51.550
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

23:51.618 --> 23:53.886
Thank you.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.856
Eduardo Fernandez,
who, first of all,

23:56.924 --> 23:59.626
looks like he works
at the public pool or something,

23:59.694 --> 24:01.362
and he comes up to me
the other day,

24:01.429 --> 24:02.663
and I completely know
he's a freshman.

24:02.730 --> 24:04.064
And he looks at me
and he goes,

24:04.132 --> 24:05.299
"Where's
the public health school?"

24:05.366 --> 24:06.934
Which is right
around the corner,

24:07.001 --> 24:08.235
and you know what I tell him?
Clifford Watkins?

24:08.303 --> 24:09.904
Excuse me.

24:09.971 --> 24:10.971
Can I help you?

24:11.039 --> 24:12.706
Jonathan Atwater.

24:12.774 --> 24:14.341
I work for Dean Wormer
in the Admissions Office.

24:14.409 --> 24:16.610
Yes, of course.
What can I do for you?

24:16.678 --> 24:18.379
Well, the Dean
personally sent me down here

24:18.447 --> 24:20.681
to invite you
to a small cocktail hour

24:20.749 --> 24:24.719
for some of
our more realistic candidates.

24:24.786 --> 24:27.021
And we'd like to keep
this sort of thing discreet,

24:27.088 --> 24:29.290
so if you'd subtly hand me
your name tag,

24:29.358 --> 24:32.593
you can proceed
directly to the Dean's office.

24:32.661 --> 24:34.562
Congratulations.

24:38.466 --> 24:40.701
Harvard Law
is the oldest law school

24:40.768 --> 24:42.369
in the country
and boasts

24:42.437 --> 24:44.904
the most successful graduates
in the world.

24:44.972 --> 24:48.141
Currently, we are six
of nine Supreme Court Justices

24:48.209 --> 24:50.744
and, of course, the President
of the United States.

25:40.931 --> 25:42.598
Uh, hi, good morning.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.632
I'm here to see--
Have a seat.

25:50.139 --> 25:52.640
Thank you.

26:09.959 --> 26:11.392
Mike Ross?

26:11.460 --> 26:13.594
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.

26:13.662 --> 26:15.663
I'll be giving you
your orientation.

26:15.730 --> 26:18.799
- Wow. You're pretty.
- Good. You've hit on me.

26:18.867 --> 26:21.201
We can get it out of the way
that I am not interested.

26:21.269 --> 26:22.336
No, I'm sorry.
I wasn't hitting on you.

26:22.403 --> 26:23.403
Trust me.

26:23.471 --> 26:25.005
I've given dozens of these,

26:25.073 --> 26:26.940
and without fail,
whatever new hotshot it is

26:27.008 --> 26:28.308
thinks that,
because I'm just a paralegal,

26:28.376 --> 26:30.076
that I will
somehow be blown away

26:30.144 --> 26:31.511
by his dazzling degree.

26:31.579 --> 26:33.814
Let me assure you,
I won't.

26:33.882 --> 26:37.352
I was.
I was hitting on you.

26:37.419 --> 26:39.187
You were.
Take notes.

26:39.255 --> 26:40.455
I'm not gonna repeat myself.

26:40.522 --> 26:43.826
I love you.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.863
The firm operates
on a chain of command model.

26:46.930 --> 26:48.465
Harvey's
your commanding officer.

26:48.532 --> 26:50.333
However, Louis Litt,
he oversees all associates,

26:50.400 --> 26:51.967
so you'll also answer
to him.

26:52.035 --> 26:53.769
What do you think
about Harvey?

26:53.837 --> 26:55.538
People are in awe of him.

26:55.606 --> 26:57.273
They say he's the best closer
there is,

26:57.341 --> 26:58.608
but I have very little contact
with him,

26:58.675 --> 26:59.809
so I don't know.

26:59.877 --> 27:02.178
And what about Louis Litt?

27:02.246 --> 27:07.316
Let's continue
with your tour.

27:07.384 --> 27:09.551
Hey, Becky.
You are glowing.

27:09.619 --> 27:11.153
I wonder why that is.
Oh, yeah.

27:11.221 --> 27:13.489
It's the day
they announce my promotion.

27:13.556 --> 27:15.058
Jimmy, have you lost weight?

27:15.126 --> 27:17.193
Steve-O.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.930
Looking like a guy
who came to work.

27:19.998 --> 27:22.233
Excuse me,
why are you scratching off

27:22.300 --> 27:23.567
the senior off my door?

27:23.635 --> 27:25.569
I got a work order
to take it off.

27:25.637 --> 27:27.571
- Who issued the work order?
- My supervisor.

27:27.639 --> 27:29.574
Why did he issue
the work order?

27:29.642 --> 27:31.576
If I knew that,
I'd be his supervisor.

27:31.643 --> 27:33.444
You seem
to be enjoying yourself.

27:33.512 --> 27:35.847
I haven't enjoyed myself
since 2004.

27:35.915 --> 27:37.682
Donna!

27:37.750 --> 27:40.251
Someone's trying to have
a little fun with me here.

27:40.318 --> 27:42.954
Jessica wants to see you
in her office.

27:43.021 --> 27:44.722
Now.

27:44.790 --> 27:50.594
And finally,
this is where you'll live.

27:50.662 --> 27:52.430
Wow.

27:52.497 --> 27:54.598
I gave you that for a reason.
You haven't taken one note.

27:54.666 --> 27:55.833
- That's because--
- Because you were

27:55.901 --> 27:57.468
too busy ogling me to listen

27:57.536 --> 27:58.769
to a word I've said?

28:01.473 --> 28:03.274
Partners' offices
anchor the wings.

28:03.342 --> 28:05.910
Fifth floor's research,
sixth is security.

28:05.977 --> 28:08.613
All work gets billed,
even if it's finding an address.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.981
I answer to Harvey

28:10.049 --> 28:11.650
and Louis Litt,
and, judging by the way

28:11.718 --> 28:13.419
you responded to my questions,

28:13.486 --> 28:16.088
I should admire Harvey
and I should fear Louis.

28:16.156 --> 28:17.790
You have been here
for five years,

28:17.857 --> 28:19.224
and just because I outrank you

28:19.292 --> 28:20.392
does not mean
I have the authority

28:20.460 --> 28:21.627
to command your services.

28:21.695 --> 28:23.062
Oh, it's also pretty clear

28:23.129 --> 28:24.497
that you think
you're too smart

28:24.564 --> 28:25.631
to be a paralegal.

28:25.699 --> 28:28.001
You know what nobody likes?

28:28.069 --> 28:29.736
Nobody likes a showoff.

28:29.804 --> 28:33.106
You used the word "ogling."

28:33.174 --> 28:35.275
When do I get
to see Harvey?

28:35.343 --> 28:37.577
Gerald Tate
fired the firm.

28:37.645 --> 28:39.780
So you're taking
my promotion away.

28:39.848 --> 28:42.649
You know, most firms would put
you in front of the bar

28:42.717 --> 28:44.284
and have your license stripped.

28:44.352 --> 28:46.086
You lied to a client,
and he figured it out.

28:46.154 --> 28:48.489
I lied to him to get him
to do the right thing

28:48.556 --> 28:50.057
and honor his goddamn contract.

28:50.125 --> 28:51.325
And you didn't seem
to mind so much

28:51.392 --> 28:52.626
when you thought
I got away with it.

28:52.694 --> 28:54.828
But you didn't get away
with it.

28:54.896 --> 28:57.265
And I can't justify handing you
a promotion

28:57.332 --> 28:58.633
on the same day that you lose
a huge client.

28:58.700 --> 29:01.269
One client
doesn't make a firm.

29:01.336 --> 29:02.771
I don't know
if you've noticed,

29:02.838 --> 29:05.140
but we're in the middle
of an economic meltdown.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.575
Companies
aren't exactly lining up

29:06.642 --> 29:08.443
to spend money
on attorneys right now.

29:08.511 --> 29:11.546
And, you know, Gerald might
have forgiven the lying

29:11.614 --> 29:13.881
had you not humiliated him.

29:13.949 --> 29:16.350
But you did,
and you need to accept that.

29:19.521 --> 29:22.423
Jessica, if you hadn't done
as much for me as you have,

29:22.490 --> 29:24.458
I'd be heading
for the door.

29:24.526 --> 29:27.194
If I hadn't done as much
for you as I have,

29:27.262 --> 29:29.062
I'd be throwing you
out the window.

29:29.130 --> 29:33.167
But, Harvey,
no more shenanigans.

29:33.234 --> 29:36.070
You do one more thing
that isn't straight as an arrow,

29:36.138 --> 29:38.139
and instead
of covering your ass,

29:38.207 --> 29:39.674
I will put you
in front of the bar myself.

29:43.480 --> 29:45.381
- Mike.
- Hey.

29:45.448 --> 29:47.950
Who's ready
for a great first day?

29:48.018 --> 29:49.852
I'm gonna have
to let you go.

29:49.920 --> 29:50.886
- What?
- I just got reamed

29:50.954 --> 29:52.488
for lying to a client,

29:52.556 --> 29:54.156
and if they find out
that I lied about you

29:54.224 --> 29:55.491
going to Harvard,
they'll take away my license.

29:55.558 --> 29:56.759
You what?

29:56.826 --> 29:59.327
Not now, Donna.

29:59.395 --> 30:00.895
Look, I have to put
my own interests

30:00.963 --> 30:02.397
above yours.
It's nothing personal.

30:02.464 --> 30:04.999
You're fired.

30:05.066 --> 30:08.468
Wait, so you're worried
that if I stay,

30:08.536 --> 30:11.805
then they might find out
that you lied about me

30:11.873 --> 30:14.208
and you'll lose your license.

30:14.276 --> 30:16.477
But if you fire me,
then I could tell them

30:16.545 --> 30:18.113
that you lied about me,

30:18.180 --> 30:19.681
and you'd definitely lose
your license.

30:19.749 --> 30:22.318
Are you telling me that

30:22.385 --> 30:23.853
if I throw you under the bus,

30:23.920 --> 30:25.287
you're gonna drag me
with you?

30:25.355 --> 30:27.323
You put your interests
above mine,

30:27.391 --> 30:30.893
and I'm just putting mine
back up next to yours.

30:33.029 --> 30:34.096
You're rehired.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.901
So should I--
all right.

30:38.968 --> 30:41.437
Here's what's gonna happen.
You're gonna give me back

30:41.504 --> 30:42.804
my promotion,
and that's the last

30:42.872 --> 30:43.972
we're gonna talk about this.

30:44.039 --> 30:45.673
And why is that?

30:45.741 --> 30:47.508
Because if you don't,
I'm gonna go across town

30:47.576 --> 30:49.343
and join Rick Peterson.

30:49.411 --> 30:51.312
I'm gonna approach every client
I've ever closed,

30:51.380 --> 30:53.181
and I'm gonna
take them with me.

30:53.248 --> 30:54.983
You do that,
and you'll force me

30:55.050 --> 30:56.551
to put you in front
of the ethics board.

30:56.619 --> 30:58.286
- I don't think you will.
- And why not?

30:58.354 --> 30:59.922
Because you were obligated
to notify them

30:59.989 --> 31:02.057
the second I lied to Gerald,
but you didn't.

31:02.125 --> 31:03.826
You put me in front
of the board right now,

31:03.894 --> 31:05.161
I'll put you right up there
with me.

31:05.229 --> 31:07.731
Hmm.

31:12.104 --> 31:16.140
I'll...I'll give you
your promotion.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.909
But you have to do something
for me.

31:17.976 --> 31:19.143
Anything.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.479
Ah.
Pro bono.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.580
Anything but that.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.149
Harvey, pro bono cases

31:24.217 --> 31:25.985
are how we, as a firm,
show that we care

31:26.052 --> 31:27.519
about more
than just ourselves.

31:27.587 --> 31:29.788
I'm not saying
we shouldn't do them.

31:29.856 --> 31:31.290
I'm saying
I shouldn't do them.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.858
And it's how you can show me

31:32.926 --> 31:35.360
that you care about more
than just yourself.

31:35.428 --> 31:37.663
You'll handle this yourself.

31:37.731 --> 31:39.031
You will not pass it off.

31:39.099 --> 31:41.633
Absolutely.

31:44.638 --> 31:46.039
Your first case.

31:46.106 --> 31:47.073
Awesome.
What is it?

31:47.141 --> 31:48.075
Pro bono.

31:48.142 --> 31:49.677
Sexual harassment.

31:49.744 --> 31:51.779
Don't tell anyone
I laid it off on you,

31:51.846 --> 31:53.614
and don't screw it up.
Got it.

31:53.682 --> 31:56.651
You can't handle it.
I'll knock it out of the park.

31:56.718 --> 31:58.753
Easy, Clarence Thomas.
Just go meet the client.

31:58.821 --> 32:01.857
Hey. Didn't I tell you
to get some better suits?

32:01.925 --> 32:03.959
I spent $500.

32:04.027 --> 32:05.895
For how many suits?

32:05.963 --> 32:08.197
Five.

32:08.265 --> 32:09.598
What?

32:09.666 --> 32:11.200
Nancy?

32:11.268 --> 32:12.868
- Mike?
- Yeah, hi.

32:15.105 --> 32:17.173
You're a kid.

32:17.240 --> 32:19.241
No, I'm a--
I'm a grown man.

32:19.309 --> 32:22.044
You're so skinny.
Have a grape.

32:22.112 --> 32:24.747
Thank you.

32:24.814 --> 32:26.782
Why don't you tell me
your story?

32:26.849 --> 32:28.483
It started two years ago.

32:28.551 --> 32:29.951
I was a stay-at-home mom

32:30.019 --> 32:31.920
to my son, Freddie.

32:31.987 --> 32:33.821
And one day
we were at little league,

32:33.889 --> 32:35.456
Freddie was five.

32:35.523 --> 32:36.890
He really hated
that he couldn't play

32:36.958 --> 32:38.292
with the older kids.

32:38.359 --> 32:40.860
It was the third inning,
and I got a phone call.

32:40.928 --> 32:42.195
My husband had been
in a car accident,

32:42.263 --> 32:45.264
and he was gone,
just like that.

32:45.332 --> 32:47.633
I'm so sorry.

32:47.701 --> 32:50.737
I did the best I could.

32:50.805 --> 32:52.606
I got myself a job
as a secretary

32:52.673 --> 32:53.974
at Devlin McGreggor.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.242
And I even got promoted

32:55.309 --> 32:56.510
to secretary of the president,

32:56.577 --> 32:58.612
Charles Hunt.

32:58.680 --> 33:01.749
And that's
when it all changed.

33:01.816 --> 33:04.151
It's okay.
Tell me what happened.

33:04.219 --> 33:06.387
He started asking me
to stay late,

33:06.455 --> 33:09.557
order in dinners together,
stuff like that.

33:09.625 --> 33:11.927
One night, he says
that if I sleep with him,

33:11.995 --> 33:13.362
he's gonna take care of me
in the firm,

33:13.429 --> 33:15.964
and, if I don't,
he's gonna fire me.

33:16.032 --> 33:17.199
So what did you do?

33:17.267 --> 33:18.534
I went to Human Resources.

33:18.602 --> 33:20.503
They said they investigated,

33:20.571 --> 33:22.972
couldn't find anything
to support my claim.

33:23.040 --> 33:24.507
Two months later,
I was fired

33:24.575 --> 33:26.276
for poor job performance.

33:26.344 --> 33:27.945
They wouldn't let me
say good-bye to anybody.

33:28.012 --> 33:30.314
They wouldn't write me
a letter of recommendation.

33:30.382 --> 33:31.983
I wasn't looking
for a payoff.

33:32.050 --> 33:34.451
All I wanted
was for it to stop.

33:34.519 --> 33:36.386
Can you help me?

33:36.454 --> 33:39.389
Uh, yes.

33:39.457 --> 33:41.791
Yes, I can.

33:41.859 --> 33:43.326
What do you need
my help for?

33:43.394 --> 33:45.428
- Wait, can I just--
- No, give me the update.

33:45.495 --> 33:47.730
You know,
she's a nice woman.

33:47.798 --> 33:49.165
She--
On the case.

33:49.233 --> 33:50.633
I don't get
emotionally attached

33:50.701 --> 33:52.034
to the client.

33:52.102 --> 33:53.837
This woman had
her life ripped apart.

33:53.905 --> 33:55.439
You don't even care?

33:55.507 --> 33:57.141
I'm not about caring.
I'm about winning.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.010
Why can't you be
about both?

33:59.077 --> 34:00.578
I'd explain it to you,

34:00.646 --> 34:03.881
but then I'd have
to care about you.

34:03.949 --> 34:05.516
What are you doing?

34:05.584 --> 34:06.751
Don't touch that.

34:06.818 --> 34:08.518
I'm just checking my lock.

34:08.587 --> 34:11.688
You ride your bike to...

34:11.757 --> 34:12.724
It's locked, okay?

34:12.791 --> 34:14.324
Come on.

34:19.398 --> 34:21.299
Defense sent over
the investigation files

34:21.367 --> 34:22.900
as a courtesy.
No, they didn't.

34:22.967 --> 34:24.369
Nobody does anything
as a courtesy.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.004
They sent those files

34:26.072 --> 34:27.205
because that's
where they want you to look.

34:27.273 --> 34:28.507
Listen, being a lawyer's

34:28.574 --> 34:30.475
like being a doctor.

34:30.543 --> 34:31.876
You mean how you don't get
emotional about the client?

34:31.944 --> 34:34.079
No, I mean you keep pressing
until it hurts.

34:34.146 --> 34:35.580
Then you know
where to look.

34:35.648 --> 34:37.315
Forget about impeaching
the investigation.

34:37.382 --> 34:39.117
It won't lead anywhere.
No employee's gonna testify

34:39.185 --> 34:40.618
against their own CEO.
Okay.

34:40.686 --> 34:42.487
So what do you suggest I do?

34:42.554 --> 34:44.556
Think.
This guy's done this once...

34:44.623 --> 34:46.357
He's done it before.

34:46.425 --> 34:47.792
And if the people
who work for him now

34:47.860 --> 34:49.293
won't testify against him...

34:49.360 --> 34:51.896
Someone who used
to work for him might.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.397
You know what,

34:53.465 --> 34:55.099
I'd subpoena
the personnel records

34:55.167 --> 34:56.634
of every woman
who's left the firm

34:56.702 --> 34:58.203
during this guy's tenure.
That's funny.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.804
That's exactly what I thought.

34:59.872 --> 35:01.339
Then what do you need
my help for?

35:01.407 --> 35:03.808
I don't know
how to fill out a subpoena.

35:03.876 --> 35:08.680
Figure it out yourself.

35:08.747 --> 35:10.882
Donna, can you show me
how to fill out a subpoena?

35:10.950 --> 35:12.450
Absolutely.
And after that,

35:12.518 --> 35:13.985
you want me to show you
how to wipe your ass?

35:14.053 --> 35:15.052
It's funny,
because you should already know

35:15.120 --> 35:16.420
how to do both those things.

35:16.488 --> 35:18.322
Ha, yeah,
that's hilarious.

35:18.390 --> 35:20.425
What's that?
That's my suit guy.

35:20.492 --> 35:22.627
Go in, tell him I sent you,
and spend some money.

35:22.694 --> 35:25.063
What does it matter
how much money I spend on suits?

35:25.131 --> 35:26.665
People respond
to how we're dressed,

35:26.733 --> 35:28.233
so like it or not,
this is what you have to do.

35:28.301 --> 35:30.235
That's weird,
you giving me advice.

35:30.303 --> 35:32.671
It sounds like you actually care
about me.

35:32.738 --> 35:34.539
I don't.
You're a reflection of me,

35:34.607 --> 35:36.342
and I absolutely
care about me.

35:36.409 --> 35:38.677
So get your skinny tie
out of my face and get to work.

35:41.381 --> 35:42.981
That was a little harsh.

35:43.049 --> 35:44.549
Really?

35:44.617 --> 35:47.318
Yeah.

35:53.392 --> 35:55.492
Mike.

35:55.560 --> 35:57.561
Where are you going?

35:57.629 --> 36:00.263
It's 6:30.
I'm going home.

36:01.566 --> 36:03.099
Okay.
What's so funny?

36:03.167 --> 36:04.734
You're a rookie associate.

36:04.801 --> 36:07.269
If you go home before 9:00
on your first week,

36:07.337 --> 36:09.405
you're not gonna make it
through your first month.

36:09.472 --> 36:10.872
And Louis Litt
wants to see you.

36:10.940 --> 36:12.875
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

36:12.943 --> 36:15.411
This tie,
is it too skinny?

36:15.478 --> 36:16.645
Yeah.

36:16.713 --> 36:19.715
Right.

36:19.782 --> 36:21.683
Yeah.

36:29.393 --> 36:31.494
I know you had orientation
from Rachel,

36:31.561 --> 36:35.365
but I wanted to give you
a special welcome from me.

36:35.432 --> 36:39.703
Amongst other things,
I'm sort of the disciplinarian

36:39.770 --> 36:40.704
of the associates.

36:44.442 --> 36:46.009
- You wanted to see me?
- Yes.

36:46.077 --> 36:48.478
Gary, please come in.
Mike, this is Gary Lipsky.

36:48.546 --> 36:50.413
Gary's one of our most promising
associates from last year.

36:50.480 --> 36:52.181
Hi.

36:52.249 --> 36:54.951
Gary, Ms. Pearson
wanted me to ask,

36:55.019 --> 36:56.486
have you completed
the Petramco filing?

36:56.553 --> 36:58.187
Well, my brother was in
over the weekend,

36:58.255 --> 36:59.389
so I didn't really get
to it.

36:59.456 --> 37:01.157
Look, I mean,
Gary, come on.

37:01.225 --> 37:02.325
This is, like, the third time
I've had to ask.

37:02.393 --> 37:03.793
I'll get right on it.

37:03.861 --> 37:05.562
Don't bother.
You're fired.

37:05.629 --> 37:07.497
What?
You can't fire me.

37:07.565 --> 37:09.132
Oh, yes, I can.
And I just did.

37:09.199 --> 37:11.834
Go pack up your things.

37:11.902 --> 37:14.070
Don't you ever show your face
in this place again.

37:20.644 --> 37:23.313
See, I arranged
for you to see that

37:23.381 --> 37:25.849
because we pay our associates
very well

37:25.917 --> 37:28.685
and we provide the opportunity
for unlimited advancement.

37:28.753 --> 37:32.189
But in return
we expect results.

37:34.693 --> 37:36.895
Have I made myself clear?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.130
Yeah.

37:41.167 --> 37:43.035
Great.

37:43.103 --> 37:45.137
Welcome to Pearson Hardman.

37:50.277 --> 37:53.512
Feel free
to go back to work.

37:56.115 --> 37:58.149
Harvey.

37:58.217 --> 38:01.286
Okay, I have two words
for you.

38:01.353 --> 38:03.988
Absolutely beautiful.

38:04.056 --> 38:06.491
You think you're the only one
who can charm a client?

38:06.559 --> 38:09.327
Categorically stunning.

38:09.394 --> 38:11.362
How's the new kid
working out?

38:11.430 --> 38:13.531
Regally hot.

38:13.599 --> 38:16.234
- You're an idiot.
- Jessica Pearson.

38:16.301 --> 38:18.302
Good night, Harvey.

38:26.145 --> 38:27.312
What are you doing here?

38:27.379 --> 38:29.815
Watching <i>Sportscenter.</i>

38:29.882 --> 38:32.484
Boo-yah.

38:32.552 --> 38:33.886
You won't return
my phone calls.

38:33.953 --> 38:36.054
Ah, yeah,
because you set me up.

38:36.122 --> 38:38.290
Do you remember that?
You think I knew about that?

38:38.358 --> 38:41.059
Here we go.
Round 50 of I get the shaft

38:41.127 --> 38:43.262
because you didn't know
the whole story.

38:43.329 --> 38:45.063
You knew there were risks
when you quoted that crap

38:45.131 --> 38:46.332
from that book.

38:46.399 --> 38:47.966
Okay, you needed money,

38:48.034 --> 38:49.368
and I came through
with an opportunity

38:49.435 --> 38:51.236
like always.

38:51.304 --> 38:52.304
Besides, you weren't
the only one who got screwed.

38:52.372 --> 38:53.706
They pulled a gun on me.

38:53.774 --> 38:54.807
Oh, really?

38:54.875 --> 38:56.175
And why did they do that?

38:56.242 --> 38:57.442
To keep me from warning you.

38:57.510 --> 38:59.111
So you did know.

38:59.179 --> 39:00.613
Well, not until
after it was too late.

39:00.681 --> 39:02.214
Well, it's too late now.

39:02.282 --> 39:04.050
Look, let me
make it up to you.

39:04.117 --> 39:05.718
Oh, you want
to make it up to me?

39:05.786 --> 39:08.620
Give me my key back.

39:15.462 --> 39:18.197
Michael.

39:18.264 --> 39:20.299
Come on.

39:20.366 --> 39:21.534
You know I don't want
to live in a world

39:21.601 --> 39:23.735
where we're not tight.

39:24.904 --> 39:27.539
Then kill yourself.

39:27.607 --> 39:29.140
Get out.

39:30.776 --> 39:33.778
Get the hell out.

39:57.962 --> 39:59.363
Donna, I need the--

39:59.430 --> 40:01.180
oh, also I didn't have
a chance to--

40:01.664 --> 40:03.232
marry me?
I took care of that too.

40:03.299 --> 40:04.900
We've been married
for the last seven years.

40:04.968 --> 40:07.002
Excellent.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.604
Umm, Devlin McGreggor's
fighting the subpoena.

40:09.672 --> 40:11.272
They filed a motion
to dismiss the case

40:11.340 --> 40:12.741
based on our
lack of evidence.

40:12.808 --> 40:14.209
- Good.
- Good.

40:14.277 --> 40:15.776
Wait, what do you mean,
"good"?

40:15.844 --> 40:17.211
They don't want
to hand over the files.

40:17.279 --> 40:18.680
You pressed where it hurt.

40:18.747 --> 40:20.215
You're looking
in the right place.

40:20.282 --> 40:21.449
Did you think
they wouldn't fight back?

40:21.517 --> 40:23.184
Well, I--
now that you mention it.

40:23.252 --> 40:24.652
Oh, my bad.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.020
I keep forgetting

40:26.088 --> 40:27.421
you don't
actually know anything.

40:27.489 --> 40:29.123
The idea is,

40:29.191 --> 40:30.925
you make a move,
they make a move.

40:30.993 --> 40:32.593
You go back and forth
until one of you wins.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.195
Okay, what if they win
the motion

40:34.262 --> 40:36.063
and the case
gets dismissed?

40:36.131 --> 40:38.432
You're not as good
as you think you are.

40:40.235 --> 40:41.569
Harvey.
What a coincidence.

40:41.637 --> 40:43.238
I was wondering
how the pro bono was coming.

40:43.305 --> 40:44.305
I'm all over it.

40:44.373 --> 40:45.606
That makes me very happy,

40:45.674 --> 40:47.241
because if I were
to find out

40:47.309 --> 40:48.476
that you weren't putting in
your full effort,

40:48.543 --> 40:49.744
I'd be very upset.

40:49.811 --> 40:52.146
No worries.
We're all good.

41:00.756 --> 41:02.890
Rachel! Rachel, Rachel,
Rachel. I need your help.

41:02.958 --> 41:04.258
There's a hearing
on my subpoena.

41:04.326 --> 41:05.827
I've got three cases
in front of you,

41:05.894 --> 41:06.828
so you're gonna have
to wait in line.

41:06.895 --> 41:07.895
No. No, no, no.

41:07.963 --> 41:09.497
My hearing is tomorrow.

41:09.564 --> 41:10.832
So why are you
coming to me?

41:10.899 --> 41:13.634
Because Donna says

41:13.702 --> 41:15.036
you're the best researcher
in the firm.

41:15.104 --> 41:18.005
Let me see the motion.

41:18.073 --> 41:20.375
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:20.442 --> 41:22.176
You have an office?

41:22.244 --> 41:24.912
How do you have an office
and I have a cubicle?

41:24.980 --> 41:27.114
Like you said,
I'm the best researcher

41:27.182 --> 41:28.949
in the firm.
Really?

41:29.017 --> 41:30.517
I just made that up.

41:30.585 --> 41:32.986
I didn't even have time
to talk to Donna.

41:33.054 --> 41:36.055
Is this all a joke
to you?

41:36.123 --> 41:37.257
'Cause I take my job seriously.

41:37.324 --> 41:38.725
No, I'm sorry.

41:38.792 --> 41:41.161
Look, I was--

41:41.228 --> 41:43.631
look, you weren't there,
okay.

41:43.699 --> 41:46.000
I care about this woman.

41:46.068 --> 41:48.136
She's got
nowhere else to turn--

41:48.204 --> 41:49.638
And you can't help her
by yourself.

41:49.706 --> 41:51.940
I can.

41:52.008 --> 41:54.843
I just prefer not to.

41:54.911 --> 41:58.347
Okay.

41:58.415 --> 41:59.748
You're asking to look
at private files

41:59.816 --> 42:01.183
without any evidence
of your assertion.

42:01.251 --> 42:02.351
Yeah, but the only way
that we can find

42:02.418 --> 42:04.152
the evidence is to look
at those files.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.153
It's a rickety argument.

42:05.221 --> 42:07.322
But is there a precedent?

42:07.390 --> 42:11.126
Let's go see
if we can find one.

42:11.194 --> 42:13.695
Research is as much art
as science,

42:13.763 --> 42:16.398
so we're gonna look
at privacy and harassment law

42:16.465 --> 42:18.767
so you can find a combination
of cases

42:18.834 --> 42:20.568
to make an argument.
I'll take privacy.

42:20.636 --> 42:22.203
I'll take harassment law.

42:22.271 --> 42:23.772
This'll take a while.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.441
We're gonna need dinner.

42:25.509 --> 42:27.577
- Chinese.
- No.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.012
I can afford Chinese
on my own.

42:29.079 --> 42:30.813
This is on the firm.
I want Sushi.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.516
Ooh.

42:32.583 --> 42:34.718
So they told me to put
my top investigator on it.

42:34.786 --> 42:37.021
- What did you do?
- What could I do?

42:37.089 --> 42:38.789
You were out of the country,
I gave them Luderman.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.026
By the way,
that dress...

42:42.094 --> 42:43.361
What, this old thing?
Come on.

42:43.428 --> 42:45.463
Beautiful.

42:45.531 --> 42:47.265
Vanessa, why don't we do this
more often?

42:47.333 --> 42:50.267
'Cause it always ends
the same way.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.470
Then why are we
doing it now?

42:52.537 --> 42:54.939
Harvey,
I don't sleep around.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.374
And I could never be
in a relationship with you.

42:57.442 --> 42:59.610
All you ever think about
is yourself.

42:59.678 --> 43:02.245
I'm thinking about you and me
right now.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.919
Please.
I insist.

43:07.987 --> 43:09.120
But I'm a gentleman.

43:09.188 --> 43:11.289
Besides, you came through

43:11.357 --> 43:13.192
on Dockery for me,
and I'm not one

43:13.259 --> 43:15.094
to forget a favor.

43:15.162 --> 43:17.096
Neither am I.

43:23.237 --> 43:25.905
Mr. Dockery,
you naughty, naughty boy.

43:30.944 --> 43:34.147
You remember when I said
you thought you were too smart

43:34.215 --> 43:35.448
to be a paralegal?
Mm-hmm.

43:35.516 --> 43:37.550
- Why...
- Aren't I a lawyer?

43:37.618 --> 43:39.619
Mm.

43:39.686 --> 43:42.221
I don't test well.
What?

43:42.289 --> 43:44.324
I am smart.

43:44.391 --> 43:45.959
And I know
I'd be a good lawyer.

43:46.026 --> 43:47.394
I just--I don't know
what it is.

43:47.461 --> 43:48.361
I can't take tests,

43:48.429 --> 43:51.397
and I bombed the LSATs.

43:51.465 --> 43:52.832
And even if I could get

43:52.900 --> 43:54.033
into law school,
there's no way

43:54.101 --> 43:55.969
I'd pass the bar.

43:56.036 --> 44:00.573
So if only there was someone
who could take the test for me.

44:00.641 --> 44:02.942
- Yeah, if only there were.
- Yeah.

44:03.010 --> 44:05.813
Hi. Where are you at
with the research

44:05.880 --> 44:08.215
for tomorrow's hearing?
Nothing yet.

44:08.282 --> 44:09.216
You say you care
about the client,

44:09.284 --> 44:10.651
but if you keep playing footsie

44:10.719 --> 44:12.253
instead of finding me
an argument,

44:12.320 --> 44:13.954
the client's gonna lose.

44:14.022 --> 44:15.523
I don't want to lose.

44:15.591 --> 44:17.758
Ugh.

44:17.826 --> 44:21.228
Look, it's no use.

44:21.296 --> 44:23.631
Okay, their investigation's
by the book.

44:23.699 --> 44:24.965
We look like the bad guys
coming in,

44:25.033 --> 44:26.366
putting them under duress.

44:26.434 --> 44:28.169
What did you just say?

44:28.236 --> 44:29.536
I said we look
like the bad guys.

44:29.604 --> 44:31.438
No, you said

44:31.506 --> 44:33.006
they did it by the book

44:33.074 --> 44:34.708
and we're putting them
under duress.

44:34.776 --> 44:39.447
Yeah.

44:39.515 --> 44:42.116
- Look.
- Hmm.

44:42.184 --> 44:44.019
This is good.
We're gonna have some fun.

44:44.087 --> 44:46.956
We?
I get to go?

44:47.023 --> 44:48.424
You didn't think
I'd let you come along?

44:48.492 --> 44:50.493
- No.
- Good instinct. I wasn't.

44:50.561 --> 44:52.029
But then I thought
it'd be cruel

44:52.096 --> 44:53.764
not to let you witness
my greatness.

44:53.831 --> 44:56.066
- Okay, can I go get my bag?
- No.

44:56.134 --> 44:57.935
- You're a true giver.
- Other side.

44:58.003 --> 45:01.038
Okay.

45:01.106 --> 45:03.107
Your honor, this case
should be thrown out.

45:03.174 --> 45:04.942
Other than her story,
the plaintiff doesn't have

45:05.010 --> 45:06.878
one piece of evidence.

45:06.946 --> 45:09.014
Because the evidence lies
within their personnel files,

45:09.081 --> 45:11.650
which they're conveniently
refusing to hand over.

45:11.717 --> 45:13.518
Those files contain
sensitive information.

45:13.585 --> 45:15.152
He's fishing at the expense

45:15.220 --> 45:16.755
of our employees' right
to privacy.

45:16.822 --> 45:19.123
Please.
They don't give a rat's ass

45:19.191 --> 45:21.059
about his employees' right
to privacy.

45:21.126 --> 45:24.095
Sorry, that's actually unfair
to rats' asses.

45:24.163 --> 45:26.097
Your honor, Mr. Specter's
claim that we don't care

45:26.165 --> 45:28.199
about our employees,
though belittling,

45:28.267 --> 45:30.702
doesn't carry any weight
as a rule of law.

45:30.770 --> 45:33.105
True, but what does carry
weight is that an investigation

45:33.173 --> 45:34.840
of sexual harassment
must be conducted

45:34.907 --> 45:36.141
without any duress.

45:36.209 --> 45:37.443
Your point?

45:37.510 --> 45:39.444
The investigator
and every person

45:39.512 --> 45:41.513
being interviewed
answers to the CEO

45:41.580 --> 45:42.914
they're investigating.

45:42.982 --> 45:47.719
That is the definition
of duress.

45:47.787 --> 45:49.021
It'd be as if your bailiff

45:49.088 --> 45:51.423
accused you of sexual harassment

45:51.491 --> 45:52.958
and you assigned
your stenographer

45:53.026 --> 45:55.227
to investigate.

45:55.295 --> 45:56.696
Now how likely would it be

45:56.763 --> 45:58.798
that this investigation
yielded any fruit?

45:58.866 --> 46:01.902
You honestly think
I would harass Herman?

46:01.969 --> 46:03.336
Well, I don't know,
your honor.

46:03.404 --> 46:05.104
Some people have a thing
for the uniform.

46:05.172 --> 46:08.174
Ugh. I'd like to think
Herman would come to me

46:08.241 --> 46:10.443
before it even got
to an investigation.

46:12.212 --> 46:15.014
I saw that.
That should be stricken.

46:15.082 --> 46:17.383
But what if Herman did come
to you, your honor?

46:17.451 --> 46:19.285
And you betrayed his trust

46:19.353 --> 46:21.487
by firing him
under false pretenses?

46:21.555 --> 46:23.323
You really think
that little of me?

46:23.390 --> 46:26.725
I wouldn't trust you
as far as I could throw you.

46:26.793 --> 46:28.895
Your honor.

46:28.962 --> 46:31.431
Hand over the files...

46:31.498 --> 46:32.899
- Oh--
- Today.

46:32.967 --> 46:34.801
That's it.

46:34.869 --> 46:39.273
Herman, I'd like to speak
to you in chambers.

46:41.009 --> 46:42.043
That was awesome.

46:42.111 --> 46:43.111
It was your argument.

46:43.178 --> 46:44.612
I just framed it in a way

46:44.680 --> 46:46.081
that humanized the situation

46:46.148 --> 46:47.616
and brightened
all of our afternoons.

46:47.684 --> 46:49.251
I feel like Michael Corleone
in that scene

46:49.318 --> 46:51.320
where that fat guy teaches him
how to shoot that gun.

46:51.387 --> 46:52.421
Are you saying
that I'm the fat guy?

46:52.489 --> 46:53.856
'Cause I'm not the fat guy.

46:53.924 --> 46:56.459
Mm.

46:56.527 --> 46:58.128
You know what his name was?

46:58.196 --> 46:59.697
- Yeah.
- Cordoza.

46:59.765 --> 47:01.132
- Clemenza.
- I knew that.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.500
I was just testing
to see if you knew it.

47:02.567 --> 47:05.102
I knew that you knew
that I knew.

47:12.277 --> 47:18.548
♪ ♪

47:18.616 --> 47:21.818
Train wreck.

47:21.886 --> 47:23.152
Hey, I'm looking

47:23.220 --> 47:24.487
for Rene.

47:24.555 --> 47:26.322
I'm Rene.
I'm sorry.

47:26.390 --> 47:30.026
We don't sell skinny jeans
at this location.

47:30.093 --> 47:33.362
Did Harvey tell you
I was coming, or...?

47:33.430 --> 47:35.264
Harvey Specter
sent you?

47:35.331 --> 47:37.332
That's another story.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.867
Do you know
your inseam?

47:38.935 --> 47:41.503
I don't.
It's probably a medium.

47:41.571 --> 47:44.507
Oh. Why don't you browse
for a while?

47:44.575 --> 47:45.642
These are the most exclusive,

47:45.709 --> 47:46.743
and we move down in price

47:46.811 --> 47:50.547
as you head to the door.

47:50.615 --> 47:53.617
Oh.
Okay.

47:57.155 --> 47:59.290
Large?

47:59.357 --> 48:02.993
That's not how it works.

48:03.061 --> 48:05.395
Huh.

48:15.806 --> 48:18.608
So Trevor's getting you to do
his dirty work for him, huh?

48:18.676 --> 48:21.310
All I know is you
aren't talking to each other.

48:21.378 --> 48:22.311
I miss you.

48:22.379 --> 48:23.646
I want things

48:23.714 --> 48:25.081
to go back
to the way they were.

48:25.149 --> 48:27.483
I miss you too.
But...

48:27.551 --> 48:29.152
I'm not sure
things are ever going back

48:29.220 --> 48:30.353
to the way they were.

48:30.421 --> 48:32.989
I gotta go.

48:33.057 --> 48:34.557
What did he say?

48:34.625 --> 48:36.059
He said things
aren't ever going back

48:36.126 --> 48:38.728
to the way they were.

48:38.796 --> 48:40.530
What did you do?

48:40.598 --> 48:42.298
I don't know.

48:47.903 --> 48:49.404
Hey.

48:49.471 --> 48:51.305
So the files
are on their way.

48:51.373 --> 48:52.674
We won?

48:52.741 --> 48:53.674
That's fantastic.

48:53.742 --> 48:55.042
So now we have a week

48:55.110 --> 48:57.311
to corroborate Nancy's story.

48:57.379 --> 49:01.648
Listen, I couldn't have done it
without you.

49:01.716 --> 49:04.351
You wouldn't even know
where to look without me.

49:04.419 --> 49:05.485
You know what nobody likes?

49:05.552 --> 49:07.721
Nobody likes a showoff.

49:08.990 --> 49:11.425
Hello.

49:11.492 --> 49:12.593
Yeah, he's here.

49:12.661 --> 49:15.429
Okay. Thank you.

49:15.497 --> 49:17.364
Files are in
Conference Room C.

49:17.432 --> 49:20.167
Why wouldn't they bring them
to my cubicle?

49:20.235 --> 49:23.237
They're trying to bury you
in paperwork.

49:23.305 --> 49:26.107
Well, they picked
the wrong guy.

49:26.174 --> 49:27.841
If they didn't, I did.

49:27.909 --> 49:29.276
Get it done
by the end of the week.

49:29.343 --> 49:30.477
I got to run
and charm our new client.

49:35.850 --> 49:37.985
Nice to finally meet you.

49:38.053 --> 49:42.056
Jessica says you're
gonna sweep me off my feet.

49:42.123 --> 49:44.191
I'll do my best,
Mr. Dockery.

49:44.259 --> 49:45.392
You got a nice serve there.

49:45.460 --> 49:47.928
Working on it.

49:50.331 --> 49:52.031
What the hell is this?

49:52.099 --> 49:52.932
It's you having sex
with a woman

49:53.000 --> 49:54.867
who isn't Mrs. Dockery.

49:54.935 --> 49:56.435
Are you trying
to blackmail me?

49:56.503 --> 49:58.070
You asked my firm
where you're vulnerable

49:58.138 --> 49:59.238
to corporate takeover.

49:59.305 --> 50:00.906
That's it right there.

50:00.974 --> 50:01.974
What are you pulling here?

50:02.042 --> 50:03.476
Your wife owns 10%

50:03.543 --> 50:05.411
of the company's
voting shares.

50:05.479 --> 50:07.046
You've been seeing this woman
and several others

50:07.114 --> 50:08.548
for quite some time.

50:08.616 --> 50:10.183
How do you think
your wife's gonna vote

50:10.251 --> 50:12.653
after she finds out?
Who says she has to find out?

50:12.720 --> 50:15.256
My investigator got these
within a week.

50:15.323 --> 50:17.858
What do you think
a motivated competitor's

50:17.926 --> 50:19.693
gonna dig up in a year?

50:22.030 --> 50:24.364
I have a solution.

50:24.432 --> 50:26.266
Trade her your preferred shares,

50:26.334 --> 50:27.634
which have no voting rights,

50:27.701 --> 50:29.669
for her common shares,
which do.

50:29.737 --> 50:32.071
The preferred shares
are worth $2 million more.

50:32.139 --> 50:33.405
A fraction
of what you'll lose

50:33.473 --> 50:35.106
if you get voted
out of your company.

50:35.174 --> 50:36.541
John, I don't care
if you sleep

50:36.608 --> 50:38.042
with every woman
in the Hamptons.

50:38.110 --> 50:40.244
Just give her
the preferred shares.

50:42.814 --> 50:45.581
Jessica said you were gonna
charm me to get my business.

50:45.649 --> 50:47.350
I'm not interested
in getting your business.

50:47.418 --> 50:49.920
I'm interested
in keeping it.

50:49.987 --> 50:52.055
I know where
they don't want us to look.

50:52.123 --> 50:54.591
Did you get through
all those files in one night?

50:54.658 --> 50:55.992
I would have done it faster,

50:56.060 --> 50:57.760
but I ordered a pizza.

50:57.828 --> 50:59.829
Speaking of which,
have you ever had

50:59.896 --> 51:01.430
the cheese in the crust?

51:01.498 --> 51:04.366
Because it blew my mind.
What'd you find?

51:04.434 --> 51:07.369
There was a dismissal
on March 12th, 2005.

51:07.437 --> 51:09.671
But the file with the employee
name on it is missing.

51:09.739 --> 51:11.272
It's our woman.
I know it is.

51:11.340 --> 51:13.274
I'm moving to slap sanctions

51:13.342 --> 51:15.042
on their attorney,
possible jail time.

51:15.110 --> 51:16.810
Guy's not gonna know
what hit him.

51:16.878 --> 51:20.581
Dennis, it's Harvey Specter.

51:20.648 --> 51:24.451
Did you have anything to do
with the March 12, 2005 files

51:24.519 --> 51:26.620
left out of discovery?

51:26.688 --> 51:28.957
If they're here by noon,
I'll believe you.

51:29.024 --> 51:32.160
If not,
we're filing for sanctions.

51:32.228 --> 51:34.563
Threat of sanctions is better
than filing for sanctions.

51:34.631 --> 51:37.400
That's what I meant.
Threaten, not file.

51:37.467 --> 51:38.468
Who would mean that?

51:38.535 --> 51:40.770
Shave.

51:40.838 --> 51:42.839
Have you ever heard
of this woman?

51:42.906 --> 51:44.173
Joanna Webster?

51:44.241 --> 51:45.874
No. Why?

51:45.942 --> 51:47.342
The company's trying
to hide her from us.

51:47.410 --> 51:49.077
You think Hunt did
the same thing to her

51:49.145 --> 51:50.678
that he did to me?
Yes.

51:50.746 --> 51:53.448
Then you have to make her
come forward and say so.

51:53.515 --> 51:54.882
Yeah.
That's the plan.

51:54.950 --> 51:57.452
Thank you.

52:06.828 --> 52:08.095
Joanna Webster?

52:08.163 --> 52:09.430
Can I help you?

52:09.498 --> 52:11.799
Hi.
My name's Mike Ross.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.033
I'm a--
I'm a lawyer.

52:13.101 --> 52:14.668
I have some questions for you

52:14.736 --> 52:17.805
about your time
at Devlin McGreggor.

52:17.873 --> 52:19.807
Please. Look, just let me
tell you a story

52:19.875 --> 52:20.908
about my client, okay?

52:20.976 --> 52:24.345
Fine. Just a second.

52:24.413 --> 52:25.846
Mr. Ross,

52:25.914 --> 52:28.349
what happened to me
happened six years ago.

52:28.417 --> 52:29.984
It was horrible,

52:30.052 --> 52:31.386
and there was a reason
I didn't do anything

52:31.453 --> 52:32.520
about it.

52:32.588 --> 52:34.055
They'll put me on that stand

52:34.123 --> 52:36.257
and attack me,
and I don't want that.

52:36.325 --> 52:40.261
Ms. Webster, Joanna,

52:40.329 --> 52:42.830
this man is a predator,

52:42.898 --> 52:45.967
and if you don't help stop him,
he will do it again.

52:49.104 --> 52:50.638
All you have to do
is give a deposition.

52:50.706 --> 52:52.373
I'm sorry.

52:52.441 --> 52:56.110
I can't do it.

53:03.953 --> 53:06.921
What happened
with the witness?

53:06.989 --> 53:11.226
Uh, I failed...

53:11.293 --> 53:14.429
To not be awesome.

53:14.497 --> 53:16.864
I got her to testify!

53:16.932 --> 53:20.001
You should have seen me.
I tried everything.

53:20.069 --> 53:21.770
He'd do it again,

53:21.837 --> 53:23.038
I'd be with her every step
of the way...

53:23.105 --> 53:24.105
Nothing worked.

53:24.173 --> 53:26.842
And then it hit me.

53:26.910 --> 53:30.112
I asked her
what if it was her daughter

53:30.180 --> 53:31.748
that he did this to.

53:31.815 --> 53:34.784
She melted.

53:34.852 --> 53:36.853
And you know how I came up
with that little gem?

53:36.921 --> 53:41.025
I cared about her.
Oh.

53:41.092 --> 53:43.794
Yeah.

53:43.862 --> 53:45.729
Thank you.

53:45.797 --> 53:47.231
I'm glad to see
that staying up all night

53:47.299 --> 53:48.332
doesn't make you act
like a complete idiot.

53:48.400 --> 53:50.034
Go home and get some sleep.

53:50.102 --> 53:51.369
I don't want you waving
that thing around

53:51.436 --> 53:52.637
during
tomorrow's deposition.

53:58.344 --> 54:00.011
Harvey.

54:00.078 --> 54:02.413
How's the pro bono going?

54:02.481 --> 54:06.150
Great. I just talked a witness
into testifying.

54:06.217 --> 54:09.253
Really?
What's the witness's name?

54:11.223 --> 54:12.290
I'm not an idiot.

54:12.357 --> 54:13.824
Don't treat me like one.

54:13.892 --> 54:15.626
You pawned off the case.

54:15.694 --> 54:18.295
Jessica,
I've got higher profile cases--

54:18.363 --> 54:20.498
Need I remind you
that when we first met,

54:20.566 --> 54:22.267
you were a screw-up?

54:22.334 --> 54:24.102
I gave you a shot
at the mail room,

54:24.170 --> 54:26.538
led you up the ranks, and then
paid for you to go to Harvard,

54:26.606 --> 54:29.575
where, by the way,
you jerked off the entire time

54:29.643 --> 54:32.646
you were there,
and I still hired you.

54:32.713 --> 54:34.715
And you've benefited
from that ever since.

54:34.782 --> 54:36.650
Look, I closed the Dockery case,
okay.

54:36.718 --> 54:38.585
You made a promise to me.

54:38.653 --> 54:42.189
You broke it, and then you lied
to my face.

54:42.257 --> 54:45.259
So let me be clear.
This isn't professional.

54:45.327 --> 54:46.894
This is personal.

54:46.961 --> 54:48.628
And I'll tell you
something else.

54:48.696 --> 54:52.665
You made your bed,
you better goddamn win.

55:06.647 --> 55:09.683
God damn it.

55:19.696 --> 55:22.564
What the hell is wrong with you?
I need the briefcase back.

55:22.632 --> 55:24.099
Oh, so that's what this
has been about, huh?

55:24.167 --> 55:26.168
You don't care
about our friendship at all.

55:26.235 --> 55:27.802
You're my oldest friend,
and you know it.

55:27.870 --> 55:30.038
But you don't seem
to care about that anymore,

55:30.106 --> 55:31.639
and, yeah, I need
the briefcase back.

55:31.707 --> 55:33.374
And I'm gonna find it, Mike.

55:33.442 --> 55:34.877
Well, I ditched it
when I was running away

55:34.944 --> 55:37.846
from the cops
that you sent me into.

56:00.870 --> 56:03.171
Mike.

56:03.239 --> 56:04.840
Where you going?

56:04.908 --> 56:06.145
To my cubicle.

56:06.146 --> 56:09.115
No, you're not.
It's pee in a cup time.

56:10.426 --> 56:12.003
I'm sorry. What?

56:12.004 --> 56:14.372
Drug test.
Follow me.

56:16.108 --> 56:17.476
I'm just gonna put my stuff
back--

56:17.543 --> 56:19.411
Now.

56:26.654 --> 56:30.557
Oh, by the way, my cousin
was your year at Harvard.

56:30.625 --> 56:32.793
And I asked him
if he knew you.

56:32.860 --> 56:35.229
It's so funny.
He didn't.

56:35.297 --> 56:36.563
Well, what's his name?

56:36.631 --> 56:37.864
Mitch Samberg.

56:37.932 --> 56:39.599
Yeah.
Don't know him.

56:41.135 --> 56:42.235
It's a big school.

56:42.303 --> 56:44.304
Not really.

56:44.372 --> 56:47.073
We get 7,000 applications
a year.

56:47.141 --> 56:49.376
You think you can just walk in
and take a tour?

56:49.444 --> 56:51.378
Oh, Mitchell.

56:51.445 --> 56:52.879
With the slicked back hair,

56:52.947 --> 56:54.381
graduated seventh in the class.

56:54.449 --> 56:56.483
Sure. Yeah.
I remember him.

56:57.560 --> 56:59.794
Time to face the music.

57:04.464 --> 57:05.664
<i>Yeah, what's up?</i>

57:05.690 --> 57:07.052
I got to get
to the Kendrick filing.

57:07.053 --> 57:08.153
Where the hell is Mike?

57:08.361 --> 57:12.064
I don't know.

57:12.132 --> 57:14.067
Leave the cup
on the counter.

57:18.072 --> 57:19.940
You'll have to leave that
out here.

57:20.008 --> 57:22.376
- Why?
- If you take it in there

57:22.444 --> 57:23.677
with you, I have to check
to make sure you don't have

57:23.745 --> 57:24.879
another urine sample in it.

58:08.257 --> 58:11.358
- Where you been?
- Hi. Um...

58:11.426 --> 58:12.893
Getting drug tested, actually.

58:12.961 --> 58:15.562
The deposition's
this afternoon.

58:15.630 --> 58:17.431
Before they get here, I want you
to grill this woman

58:17.499 --> 58:18.899
about her background
for anything they might use

58:18.967 --> 58:20.100
against her.

58:20.168 --> 58:21.868
You got it?
Got it.

58:21.936 --> 58:23.402
- Make her tell you everything.
- Everything.

58:23.470 --> 58:24.504
- Everything.
- Everything.

58:24.571 --> 58:27.373
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:35.182 --> 58:38.184
I had been working six months

58:38.252 --> 58:41.021
when Mr. Hunt started asking me
to work more,

58:41.088 --> 58:42.889
order dinner.

58:42.957 --> 58:47.595
One night, late, he tried
to have sex with me.

58:47.662 --> 58:51.566
The next day, I requested
a change in assignment.

58:51.634 --> 58:55.269
Two months later I was fired
for having a bad attitude.

58:55.337 --> 58:57.872
This is ridiculous.

58:57.939 --> 58:59.539
Wipe that smirk
off your face.

58:59.607 --> 59:01.041
You're not even supposed
to be here.

59:01.108 --> 59:03.710
Mr. Hunt has every right
to be here.

59:03.778 --> 59:07.981
Now, Ms. Webster, after working
for Devlin McGreggor,

59:08.049 --> 59:10.650
you then went on to waitress
at Hooters, right?

59:10.717 --> 59:13.653
- Yes, I did.
- A place that advertises

59:13.721 --> 59:16.088
the sexuality
of its waitstaff, correct?

59:16.156 --> 59:18.357
You will have
to ask them that.

59:18.425 --> 59:20.293
I'm asking you.

59:20.361 --> 59:24.464
And she's not answering.
Move on.

59:24.532 --> 59:29.803
Ms. Webster, would you say
that you're a truthful person?

59:29.870 --> 59:32.405
Yes.

59:32.473 --> 59:35.075
So when you said earlier
that you had never been arrested

59:35.143 --> 59:38.245
for a crime, you were speaking
the truth?

59:38.313 --> 59:41.615
- Yes.
- Yes, so in 1993 then

59:41.683 --> 59:45.453
you were not arrested for
stealing $1,000 worth of jewelry

59:45.520 --> 59:48.756
from the Willow Grove Mall
in Pennsylvania?

59:48.824 --> 59:53.160
I was 17.
That was one mistake.

59:53.228 --> 59:55.262
Those records were supposed
to be sealed.

59:55.330 --> 59:57.231
So when you say
those records were sealed,

59:57.299 --> 59:58.699
what you mean to say
is you thought

59:58.767 --> 59:59.734
you could get away
with a lie?

59:59.802 --> 01:00:01.435
No, that's not it.

01:00:01.503 --> 01:00:03.436
You're making it seem
different that it is.

01:00:03.504 --> 01:00:06.206
I'm sorry.
You were arrested in your past

01:00:06.274 --> 01:00:07.942
and you lied about it here
under oath.

01:00:08.009 --> 01:00:10.044
Is that
making it seem different

01:00:10.111 --> 01:00:11.946
than what it is?

01:00:14.316 --> 01:00:17.885
No answer.
Hmm, all right.

01:00:17.953 --> 01:00:20.521
Let me ask you this,
since you've lied here once,

01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:23.257
what's to make us believe
you're not lying about Mr. Hunt?

01:00:36.605 --> 01:00:38.172
How the hell did you miss
that arrest?

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.308
I did every background check
we have.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:41.476
Did you grill her
like I told you to?

01:00:41.543 --> 01:00:43.111
It was a sealed record,
Harvey!

01:00:43.178 --> 01:00:44.111
Goddamn it, I knew it.

01:00:44.179 --> 01:00:45.914
Fix it.

01:00:45.981 --> 01:00:48.849
Joanna!
Wait. Please!

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:50.585
This is why I didn't want
to testify.

01:00:50.652 --> 01:00:52.119
They twist something
from 100 years ago

01:00:52.187 --> 01:00:54.388
and make me look like a liar.

01:00:54.456 --> 01:00:55.556
They make it sound
like what he did

01:00:55.623 --> 01:00:57.157
to me didn't happen.

01:00:57.225 --> 01:00:58.692
It doesn't matter.
All right?

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.093
I just--I need you
to testify on Friday

01:01:00.161 --> 01:01:01.928
and keep this case alive.

01:01:01.996 --> 01:01:03.630
We don't have time to find
anyone else before--

01:01:03.698 --> 01:01:04.898
would you please wait?

01:01:04.966 --> 01:01:06.700
No. I'm not waiting.

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:08.168
You promised this
wouldn't happen, and it did.

01:01:08.236 --> 01:01:10.670
You never told me
you were arrested.

01:01:10.738 --> 01:01:13.406
Don't contact me again,
please.

01:01:51.242 --> 01:01:53.944
What happened
with the witness?

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:57.881
Nothing. Nothing happened.
I couldn't fix it.

01:01:57.949 --> 01:02:00.851
So you're going to quit?

01:02:00.919 --> 01:02:03.254
It's either that
or have Louis Litt fire me.

01:02:03.322 --> 01:02:04.789
What are you talking about?

01:02:04.857 --> 01:02:07.025
My first day,
Louis fired Gary Lipsky

01:02:07.092 --> 01:02:08.693
for screwing up a case.

01:02:08.761 --> 01:02:10.328
He said
if I did the same thing

01:02:10.396 --> 01:02:12.431
I'd be gone just as fast.

01:02:12.499 --> 01:02:13.799
Well, you go back
to the witness' house

01:02:13.867 --> 01:02:15.567
and you get her
to testify again.

01:02:15.635 --> 01:02:17.503
- I tried. There's no way.
- There's always a way.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:19.004
Then why don't you go
and convince her?

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.740
Because you screwed it up.

01:02:20.808 --> 01:02:22.842
Oh, and you don't give
a damn about the client. Right.

01:02:22.910 --> 01:02:24.645
- That's not my job.
- Does your job

01:02:24.712 --> 01:02:26.046
include giving a damn
about me?

01:02:26.114 --> 01:02:27.648
Because the least
you could do is offer

01:02:27.716 --> 01:02:29.316
to stand up to Louis for me.
Stand up for you?

01:02:29.384 --> 01:02:30.685
I put my ass
on the line for you,

01:02:30.753 --> 01:02:32.187
but it turns out
you may have had the balls

01:02:32.254 --> 01:02:34.155
to get this job,
but you don't have the courage

01:02:34.223 --> 01:02:35.857
to stick it out
when it gets tough.

01:02:35.925 --> 01:02:37.292
- That's not true.
- Isn't it?

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.994
You've had one foot
out the door

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:40.829
since you got here.
What are you talking about?

01:02:40.897 --> 01:02:42.164
I'm talking
about that briefcase

01:02:42.231 --> 01:02:43.866
being locked in your desk.
Yeah, I saw it.

01:02:43.933 --> 01:02:45.834
And I know what it is.

01:02:45.901 --> 01:02:48.170
It's your backup plan
in case this doesn't work out.

01:02:48.237 --> 01:02:50.004
You can make some quick cash
and go right back

01:02:50.072 --> 01:02:52.307
to the life you told me
you didn't want to lead.

01:02:52.374 --> 01:02:55.043
So if you want to quit,
go ahead.

01:02:55.111 --> 01:02:58.012
But this isn't because of Louis,
and it isn't because of me.

01:02:58.080 --> 01:02:59.614
It's because you're afraid
you might have to admit

01:02:59.682 --> 01:03:01.850
that you're not
as smart as you think you are.

01:03:04.921 --> 01:03:06.388
If you're here in the morning,

01:03:06.456 --> 01:03:08.190
I'll know
I still have an associate.

01:04:00.543 --> 01:04:03.279
Hey, I get
that you were upset

01:04:03.346 --> 01:04:04.914
that I was promoted
before you,

01:04:04.982 --> 01:04:07.283
but if you ever threaten to fire
one of my guys again,

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:09.718
I am going to kick your ass.

01:04:09.786 --> 01:04:13.155
Hmm.
What are you talking about?

01:04:13.222 --> 01:04:15.023
Don't play dumb with me,
all right?

01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:19.128
You fired Gary Lipsky
in front of Mike Ross.

01:04:19.195 --> 01:04:21.831
What's so funny?

01:04:21.898 --> 01:04:24.200
Gary Lipsky works
in the mail room.

01:04:24.268 --> 01:04:28.371
- What?
- I didn't fire anyone.

01:04:28.438 --> 01:04:29.572
That's how I let
the new associates know

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:31.473
what's expected of them.

01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:35.378
You plant a fake employee
to manipulate the assoc--

01:04:35.445 --> 01:04:36.612
that's it.

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:38.814
What?

01:05:03.443 --> 01:05:06.111
Michael.

01:05:06.179 --> 01:05:09.681
I want to quit.

01:05:09.749 --> 01:05:12.951
Come here.

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:24.229
When your parents died,

01:05:24.297 --> 01:05:28.834
I lost
my son and my daughter-in-law.

01:05:28.902 --> 01:05:34.774
I was scared, alone,
and I was too old to raise you.

01:05:34.841 --> 01:05:36.676
But I had no choice.

01:05:36.744 --> 01:05:42.483
Because who else was going
to care of my grandson?

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:46.254
You made me a promise before.

01:05:46.322 --> 01:05:49.691
You're in the door.

01:05:49.759 --> 01:05:52.461
Promise me now the only way
you'll leave

01:05:52.529 --> 01:05:55.831
is if they rip you out.

01:06:07.911 --> 01:06:09.445
You can save your breath.

01:06:09.513 --> 01:06:10.613
There's no way I'm testifying

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.347
at the hearing tomorrow.

01:06:12.415 --> 01:06:14.917
That's not why I'm here.

01:06:14.984 --> 01:06:17.252
- I know what you did.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.421
You never worked
for Devlin McGreggor,

01:06:19.488 --> 01:06:21.556
and you were never harassed
by Mr. Hunt.

01:06:21.623 --> 01:06:23.524
- That's a l--
- Now I could tell you

01:06:23.592 --> 01:06:25.826
that I've got the canceled
checks or the wire transfer

01:06:25.894 --> 01:06:28.695
or whatever smoking gun
that exists--I don't.

01:06:28.763 --> 01:06:30.196
But I will.
And when I do,

01:06:30.264 --> 01:06:31.764
you'll be going to jail
unless you tell me

01:06:31.832 --> 01:06:34.200
what happened right now.

01:06:35.903 --> 01:06:38.037
I'm the guy you tell.

01:06:41.108 --> 01:06:44.044
All I had to do was waste
your time until tomorrow

01:06:44.111 --> 01:06:45.912
after the hearing.

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.950
Please,
I just needed the money.

01:06:50.018 --> 01:06:52.253
I don't want to go to jail.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:56.023
Here's what you're gonna do...

01:06:56.091 --> 01:06:58.959
Did you call
this place before?

01:06:59.027 --> 01:07:00.728
Mike!

01:07:00.795 --> 01:07:01.829
- Hey.
- I'm not giving this to you

01:07:01.896 --> 01:07:03.597
because you need it.

01:07:03.665 --> 01:07:06.666
I'm giving it to you
because I don't.

01:07:06.734 --> 01:07:09.169
And I don't know if I'm ready
to forgive you yet or not,

01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:11.838
but I do know we're even.

01:07:11.906 --> 01:07:15.642
Wait a second.

01:07:18.879 --> 01:07:20.847
I...

01:07:20.915 --> 01:07:22.715
Well...

01:07:29.056 --> 01:07:31.057
Don't.

01:07:31.125 --> 01:07:32.092
Now we're even.

01:07:36.098 --> 01:07:37.098
Huh.

01:07:49.646 --> 01:07:53.983
I see you came to work today.
Nice suit.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:56.618
It was a barter transaction.

01:07:56.686 --> 01:07:59.654
I got six of them
for one little briefcase.

01:08:02.691 --> 01:08:06.360
Listen...

01:08:06.427 --> 01:08:08.362
I'm sorry and--

01:08:08.429 --> 01:08:11.031
Forget it.

01:08:11.099 --> 01:08:14.868
When I first started,
Jessica rode me so hard...

01:08:14.936 --> 01:08:16.870
I quit once a month.

01:08:16.938 --> 01:08:19.872
I just told you
what you needed to hear.

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:22.876
That's just it.
I've only ever had one person

01:08:22.943 --> 01:08:26.645
who told me
what I needed to hear.

01:08:26.712 --> 01:08:29.782
Maybe it's time I started
trusting somebody else.

01:08:39.558 --> 01:08:41.325
Merry Christmas.

01:08:46.197 --> 01:08:47.263
Is this for real?

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.966
You know what to do.

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:53.770
Press until it hurts.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:58.441
Wire transfer from your
account to Joanna Webster's,

01:08:58.508 --> 01:09:00.876
phone records
with Joanna Webster

01:09:00.944 --> 01:09:03.245
prior to her testimony,

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.849
and an affidavit stating
you paid Ms. Webster

01:09:05.916 --> 01:09:07.751
to falsely testify.

01:09:09.787 --> 01:09:12.456
Mr. Hunt, harassment
is a civil violation.

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:13.858
The penalty is money.

01:09:13.926 --> 01:09:15.926
But witness tampering,
that's a crime,

01:09:15.993 --> 01:09:17.428
and you will go to prison,

01:09:17.496 --> 01:09:18.763
where I guarantee
you'll learn

01:09:18.831 --> 01:09:20.598
more about unwanted
sexual advances

01:09:20.666 --> 01:09:22.466
than you can possibly imagine.

01:09:22.535 --> 01:09:25.937
Do you think
this is going to intimidate me?

01:09:26.005 --> 01:09:28.072
Even if this evidence
was credible,

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:29.506
who are you going to get
to prosecute

01:09:29.575 --> 01:09:31.442
a small-time
witness tampering charge, huh?

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:34.979
Harvey, didn't you graduate
law school

01:09:35.046 --> 01:09:37.149
with the current
U.S. Attorney in New York?

01:09:37.216 --> 01:09:38.883
In fact, I did.

01:09:38.951 --> 01:09:40.451
And I think
he might even be interested

01:09:40.519 --> 01:09:41.819
in pursuing a case like this.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:43.287
Wait, are you two still close?

01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:44.921
Well, I was the best man
at his wedding.

01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:46.457
- Wow.
- No, you weren't.

01:09:46.524 --> 01:09:47.792
You're bluffing.

01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:49.227
No.

01:09:49.294 --> 01:09:50.694
I think I've got
some pictures...

01:09:50.761 --> 01:09:53.531
of us at the ceremony.

01:09:53.598 --> 01:09:55.499
Let's see.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:57.934
Yeah.
Here we are.

01:09:58.002 --> 01:10:00.971
You must admit,
I look very dashing.

01:10:01.038 --> 01:10:02.238
This is me and his mother.

01:10:02.306 --> 01:10:03.706
The woman adores me.

01:10:03.774 --> 01:10:05.308
Here we are
at his bachelor party.

01:10:05.375 --> 01:10:07.776
There's no strippers.
It was lame.

01:10:07.844 --> 01:10:10.279
But he can't put guys like you
away for sexual harassment

01:10:10.346 --> 01:10:12.181
and then go to strip clubs,
now, can he?

01:10:12.248 --> 01:10:13.783
All right.
What do you want?

01:10:13.851 --> 01:10:16.318
An admission of guilt
and a guarantee

01:10:16.386 --> 01:10:18.955
that you'll obtain treatment
before working again.

01:10:21.025 --> 01:10:23.460
And Nancy gets reinstated
with back pay.

01:10:23.528 --> 01:10:26.297
- Fine.
- And a raise.

01:10:26.364 --> 01:10:28.365
Okay.
All right.

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:30.101
Are we done?

01:10:30.168 --> 01:10:31.803
The kid should be able
to grow up without the burden

01:10:31.871 --> 01:10:33.604
of tuition hanging over
his head, don't you think?

01:10:33.672 --> 01:10:34.772
Which is why
you're also gonna pay Nancy

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:36.107
an extra $250,000.

01:10:36.175 --> 01:10:37.575
Charles.

01:10:41.679 --> 01:10:43.980
Gentlemen.

01:11:02.367 --> 01:11:05.937
Thank you for everything.

01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:07.539
You're welcome.

01:11:07.607 --> 01:11:09.040
So just one question.

01:11:09.108 --> 01:11:10.208
Why'd you go
to Joanna's house?

01:11:10.276 --> 01:11:12.044
Because I figured it out.

01:11:12.112 --> 01:11:13.512
I object.

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.247
I think you did it
because you care.

01:11:15.314 --> 01:11:17.516
I did it because it's my job.

01:11:17.584 --> 01:11:19.585
Would you admit it?
You care about me.

01:11:19.653 --> 01:11:21.954
I saw you smile when I showed up
for work this morning.

01:11:22.022 --> 01:11:25.891
I didn't smile.
I was thinking of a funny joke.

01:11:25.959 --> 01:11:27.726
Look,
we start on this tomorrow.

01:11:27.794 --> 01:11:30.095
Does this mean
we're officially a team now?

01:11:30.163 --> 01:11:32.197
I wouldn't move your things
into Wayne Manor just yet.

01:11:32.265 --> 01:11:36.101
- So now you're Batman?
- Closer to him than Clemenza.

01:11:36.169 --> 01:11:39.238
- Oh, yeah, Kilmer.
- Clooney.

01:11:39.306 --> 01:11:40.973
Keaton.

01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.010
Did you really quit
when you first started?

01:11:44.078 --> 01:11:45.578
Of course not.
I'm not a wuss.
