00:10.280 --> 00:14.350
<i>We all go a little crazy
when we fall in love.</i>

00:14.352 --> 00:16.952
<i>It's nothing new.
Take this hunter.</i>

00:16.954 --> 00:18.387
<i>He finds a shiny
rock and figures</i>

00:18.389 --> 00:20.022
<i>he'll give it to
his girlfriend.</i>

00:20.024 --> 00:21.857
<i>The next day he's
leaving for a lion hunt,</i>

00:21.859 --> 00:24.827
<i>and in his excitement, he
drops the rock on his way out.</i>

00:24.829 --> 00:26.729
<i>The girlfriend finds it
and she's all like,</i>

00:26.731 --> 00:29.365
<i>"who is this for?
Zog doesn't like shiny rocks.</i>

00:29.367 --> 00:31.400
<i>"Wait. That girl uba
likes shiny rocks,</i>

00:31.402 --> 00:33.869
<i>"and zog was totally asking
about her the other day</i>

00:33.871 --> 00:35.704
<i>"when we were
skinning that goat.</i>

00:35.706 --> 00:37.773
<i>"Uba. I can't
believe it!</i>

00:37.775 --> 00:39.708
<i>That stupid whore,"
blah, blah, blah.</i>

00:39.710 --> 00:41.143
<i>You see where
it goes from there.</i>

00:41.145 --> 00:42.878
<i>It's no different today.</i>

00:42.880 --> 00:44.880
<i>It doesn't matter who
you are, nobody's safe.</i>

00:44.882 --> 00:47.182
<i>You get a text message from
a significant other with</i>

00:47.184 --> 00:49.051
<i>one exclamation point
when you expected</i>

00:49.053 --> 00:51.720
<i>three exclamation points,
and the next thing you know</i>

00:51.722 --> 00:53.055
<i>you're right off the cliff,</i>

00:53.057 --> 00:55.357
<i>descending fast
into crazy valley.</i>

00:55.359 --> 00:57.159
<i>But then after
the misunderstanding</i>

00:57.161 --> 00:59.261
<i>is cleared up, you bounce back.</i>

00:59.263 --> 01:01.330
<i>You realize you were
just acting silly,</i>

01:01.332 --> 01:03.799
<i>and you get back
to being in love.</i>

01:03.801 --> 01:06.869
<i>But there are some people
who are different.</i>

01:06.871 --> 01:09.238
<i>The truly lovesick
get it much worse.</i>

01:09.240 --> 01:11.006
No!

01:11.008 --> 01:15.077
<i>For evidence I submit
my best friend, Charlie darby.</i>

01:15.079 --> 01:17.046
<i>Here he is a few months ago,</i>

01:17.048 --> 01:19.415
<i>before he was
diagnosed a psychotic.</i>

01:19.417 --> 01:21.950
<i>Back then he just thought
he was unlucky with women,</i>

01:21.952 --> 01:24.687
<i>and stupid me, I believed him.</i>

01:24.689 --> 01:27.956
<i>Looking back on it, I guess it
does seem a little farfetched</i>

01:27.958 --> 01:30.426
<i>that Hannah Cartwright,
his eighth-grade girlfriend</i>

01:30.428 --> 01:33.729
<i>gave him this, and then
left him the next day</i>

01:33.731 --> 01:35.764
<i>for the kid from
"happy days."</i>

01:35.766 --> 01:38.000
<i>There was Michelle
from grad school:</i>

01:38.002 --> 01:41.070
<i>"The only thing I love
more than coffee is you."</i>

01:41.072 --> 01:43.172
<i>According to Charlie,
she forgot to mention</i>

01:43.174 --> 01:46.442
<i>half the English faculty
at San Francisco state.</i>

01:46.444 --> 01:49.244
<i>Which brings us to jacinda.</i>

01:49.246 --> 01:51.180
<i>Turned out not only
was she married,</i>

01:51.182 --> 01:53.749
<i>but her husband was
in prison in Sydney.</i>

01:53.751 --> 01:56.485
<i>Bas Anderson.
String of armed robberies.</i>

01:56.487 --> 01:59.421
<i>Okay, I'm sure
I seem like a moron</i>

01:59.423 --> 02:02.291
<i>for not picking up on any of
his lunacy a little sooner.</i>

02:02.293 --> 02:05.060
<i>At the time, I really
did just believe him.</i>

02:05.062 --> 02:07.296
<i>Why wouldn't I?
He's my best friend.</i>

02:07.298 --> 02:08.997
<i>He's the principal
of my school.</i>

02:08.999 --> 02:11.467
<i>He's the godfather
to my beautiful daughter.</i>

02:11.469 --> 02:13.936
<i>But if there's
one thing I've learned,</i>

02:13.938 --> 02:16.438
<i>it's that all those things
can be true about a guy</i>

02:16.440 --> 02:19.842
<i>and he can still be
completely and utterly</i>

02:19.844 --> 02:21.310
<i>out of his mind.</i>

02:21.312 --> 02:23.245
You got any idea what
this stuff is worth?

02:23.247 --> 02:27.416
You can't put a value on it.
My heart is in this box.

02:27.418 --> 02:29.818
So, what...
Like around $40?

02:34.124 --> 02:36.058
Thank you for your donation.

02:45.401 --> 02:47.136
What do you say?

02:47.138 --> 02:49.037
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.
I love it.

02:49.039 --> 02:51.273
Isn't that ironic?

02:51.275 --> 02:53.408
I used to love the person
who gave that to me.

02:54.444 --> 02:55.978
What's a mate?

02:55.980 --> 02:58.213
A mate is someone
who says they love you,

02:58.215 --> 03:00.849
but they really have
a boyfriend in prison.

03:00.851 --> 03:03.152
Honey, why don't you go put that
with your other stuffed animals?

03:03.154 --> 03:04.553
I'm trying to help her.

03:04.555 --> 03:07.356
Charlie, that's a little
heavy for a five-year-old.

03:07.358 --> 03:09.525
It's never too early
to start learning about

03:09.527 --> 03:11.193
the dangers of love.

03:11.195 --> 03:13.395
So, if jacinda's
boyfriend makes parole,

03:13.397 --> 03:16.198
I may need to live with
you guys for a while.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.834
From now on, why don't you let
us pick out the women you date?

03:18.836 --> 03:20.369
It'd be impossible
to do any worse.

03:20.371 --> 03:22.471
Thanks for the offer,
but I am retiring from

03:22.473 --> 03:25.374
that aspect of my life
effective immediately.

03:25.376 --> 03:28.043
I got rid of every
remembrance of every woman

03:28.045 --> 03:30.946
who ever broke my heart,
and I am now officially done.

03:30.948 --> 03:34.283
Hey, I thought you had a date
meeting us at the wedding.

03:34.285 --> 03:36.218
Well, I didn't say
I'm not gonna date.

03:36.220 --> 03:38.020
I'm just not gonna
let myself fall in love

03:38.022 --> 03:39.254
in the near future,

03:39.256 --> 03:41.089
or the distant future.
The future.

03:41.091 --> 03:42.958
How do you date
and not fall in love?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.593
You just date
the kind of people

03:44.595 --> 03:46.228
you can never
fall in love with.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.131
Hey. Hey, bin laden.

03:49.133 --> 03:50.999
Bring me some more grape.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.035
I don't appreciate that.
Yeah?

03:53.037 --> 03:54.870
And I don't appreciate
you people hiding bombs

03:54.872 --> 03:56.371
in your underwear.

04:01.212 --> 04:03.512
I think that trout had
a load in its belly.

04:05.448 --> 04:07.249
I'm gonna induce vomiting.

04:11.187 --> 04:13.055
I don't know why you
won't call my friend sue.

04:13.057 --> 04:14.957
Is it because she has class?

04:14.959 --> 04:17.226
I told you,
I am not interested.

04:17.228 --> 04:18.994
This is exactly
why I brought a date,

04:18.995 --> 04:20.928
so I wouldn't have people
fixing me up all night.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.431
You didn't even
accomplish that.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.600
All you did was put
the busboys in danger.

04:24.602 --> 04:26.902
And the bridesmaids.
I think one lost a tooth

04:26.904 --> 04:28.270
during the bouquet thing.

04:28.272 --> 04:30.639
She really wanted it.
She's looking for love.

04:30.641 --> 04:32.040
Maybe she should try the zoo.

04:32.042 --> 04:33.642
Okay, look.
Enough.

04:33.644 --> 04:35.644
Obviously I didn't
know enough about her.

04:35.646 --> 04:38.347
I met her online.
Paranoid-racist.Com?

04:38.349 --> 04:40.983
Will you lay off,
Roberta? Huh?

04:40.985 --> 04:43.452
Come on. She marches
to her own beat.

04:47.257 --> 04:48.624
Pardon me.

04:48.626 --> 04:50.592
Yeah, fuck this clambake.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.562
I don't need you.
I already got a cock.

04:56.666 --> 04:58.634
Today's announcements have been

04:58.636 --> 05:00.535
coming to you from Rotterdam.

05:00.537 --> 05:04.039
<i>See you next Tuesday when
the good ship Lincoln elementary</i>

05:04.041 --> 05:07.175
lands in the biggest port
in South America!

05:07.177 --> 05:10.412
In the meantime,
greetings from Rotterdam.

05:24.161 --> 05:25.961
Come on, you can do this.

05:43.313 --> 05:45.113
So, what are you doing tonight?

05:45.115 --> 05:47.182
Do you want to, uh,
want to grab a beer?

05:47.184 --> 05:49.217
Can't do it. Got me
a little date night.

05:49.219 --> 05:51.486
So, just the two of you?

05:51.488 --> 05:52.688
Yeah.

05:52.690 --> 05:54.990
Excuse me.

05:54.992 --> 05:56.191
Ahoy.

05:58.228 --> 06:01.063
Molly Kingston? I met you
at the hotel yesterday?

06:01.065 --> 06:02.664
Right.
"Love shack."

06:02.666 --> 06:05.334
<i>So this probably
requires some explanation.</i>

06:05.336 --> 06:06.969
Hey, um, you don't

06:06.971 --> 06:09.137
happen to know the words
to "love shack," do you?

06:09.139 --> 06:11.073
Actually, I do.

06:11.075 --> 06:14.042
<i>Sorry. Still confusing. Let's
go back a little further.</i>

06:14.044 --> 06:16.011
<i>Okay...</i>

06:16.013 --> 06:17.479
<i>Great.</i>

06:17.481 --> 06:19.414
<i>So, after Charlie
dropped off Roberta,</i>

06:19.416 --> 06:21.316
<i>he headed back
into the elks lodge</i>

06:21.318 --> 06:24.252
<i>past the wedding reception,
past a retirement party,</i>

06:24.254 --> 06:27.155
<i>past a bar mitzvah,
and straight to the bar</i>

06:27.157 --> 06:29.257
<i>where he promptly met
Molly Kingston.</i>

06:29.259 --> 06:31.026
Can I get a big
glass of whiskey?

06:31.028 --> 06:32.661
<i>Lead singer of totally awesome,</i>

06:32.663 --> 06:35.597
<i>Southern California's
tenth best '80s cover band.</i>

06:35.599 --> 06:37.599
<i>Turns out it was not
her finest hour either,</i>

06:37.601 --> 06:39.167
<i>and she let him know it.</i>

06:39.169 --> 06:41.503
That bar mitzvah boy
told me I sucked.

06:41.505 --> 06:43.505
But you know what?
He sucks, okay?

06:43.507 --> 06:47.275
I don't care if he became
a man today, he sucks.

06:47.277 --> 06:49.177
If you hate your job so much,

06:49.179 --> 06:51.747
maybe you should
do something else.

06:51.749 --> 06:54.416
I just have to make
it through today.

06:54.418 --> 06:56.685
And then I'm going to do
something with more dignity,

06:56.687 --> 06:58.587
like strip.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.091
We're back in two minutes.

07:07.064 --> 07:09.031
I gotta run.
Molly Kingston.

07:09.033 --> 07:10.799
Charlie darby.

07:10.801 --> 07:13.535
Are you the Charlie darby
who's the principal at Lincoln?

07:13.537 --> 07:15.604
I am, yeah.
Do we have one of yours?

07:15.606 --> 07:17.339
My nephew, Timmy Clark.

07:17.341 --> 07:20.275
Ah. I love Timmy.
He's a great kid.

07:20.277 --> 07:22.277
He worships you.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.181
Hey, um, you don't

07:26.183 --> 07:28.283
happen to know the words
to "love shack," do you?

07:28.285 --> 07:30.118
Actually, I do.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.820
Uh...

07:33.424 --> 07:35.424
<i>So with that little connection,</i>

07:35.426 --> 07:37.059
<i>that brings us back to...</i>

07:37.061 --> 07:39.394
Right. "Love shack."

07:39.396 --> 07:42.230
So, I took your advice
and I'm looking for a job.

07:42.232 --> 07:45.467
Ah. I hope this isn't
too forward, but,

07:45.469 --> 07:47.569
I-I was wondering if
I can give you my resume?

07:47.571 --> 07:49.704
Sure. No problem.

07:52.075 --> 07:54.509
Did you just get
your credential?

07:54.511 --> 07:57.479
Actually, you know,
I don't have my credential yet,

07:57.481 --> 07:59.781
but I have my-my
substitute certification.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.317
Oh, well, the subs are hired
at the district level.

08:02.319 --> 08:05.220
We have nothing to do with that
at the individual schools.

08:05.222 --> 08:08.356
But, we are happy
to pass it on for you.

08:08.358 --> 08:10.826
Thank you.

08:12.195 --> 08:14.196
So, uh, I guess I'd better run.

08:16.165 --> 08:18.567
It was nice to see you,
captain.

08:20.837 --> 08:23.638
What's wrong with you?
She's giving you her resume

08:23.640 --> 08:25.407
because she wants
you to call her.

08:25.409 --> 08:28.477
I told you, I have no
interest in a woman that I...

08:28.479 --> 08:31.580
Might actually
be interested in.

08:31.582 --> 08:33.582
Would you think about it?

08:36.251 --> 08:39.254
Well educated.
Diverse interests.

08:39.256 --> 08:41.456
Nancy Reagan award
for community service.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.291
She sounds awful.

08:46.562 --> 08:48.396
Hey, good luck.

08:53.569 --> 08:55.237
See you tomorrow.

08:55.239 --> 08:56.905
All right.

08:56.907 --> 08:59.741
Indistinct)

09:03.379 --> 09:05.680
The key is just
for emergencies.

09:05.682 --> 09:08.283
What you're doing is
breaking and entering.

09:08.285 --> 09:09.684
What am I supposed to do?

09:09.686 --> 09:12.187
Every time I knock,
you don't answer.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.262
Have you seen
"when Harry ate Sally"?

09:20.264 --> 09:22.164
Somehow I missed that one.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.199
Well, let's watch it then.

09:24.201 --> 09:25.901
It answers
the age-old question,

09:25.903 --> 09:27.602
can two friends
go down on each other

09:27.604 --> 09:29.437
and still be friends
in the morning?

09:29.439 --> 09:30.939
Why don't you
go home and watch it,

09:30.941 --> 09:33.208
and tell me what
conclusion they come to?

09:33.210 --> 09:35.844
I enjoy watching porn
more with somebody else.

09:39.483 --> 09:42.184
And I'm gonna have to
ask for the key back.

09:42.186 --> 09:44.886
That key is the conduit to
my greatest human connection.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.255
I'm your greatest
human connection?

09:47.257 --> 09:49.457
Do you even know my last name?

09:49.459 --> 09:52.227
I don't see how
that's relevant.

09:54.497 --> 09:57.399
You know, I don't get it.
We're both home,

09:57.401 --> 09:59.367
the tube's on,
we're eating cereal.

09:59.369 --> 10:01.570
What's the harm in us
doing it together?

10:37.440 --> 10:38.940
Hello.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.642
Hi.

10:46.515 --> 10:47.949
You okay?

10:47.951 --> 10:49.884
You look a little pale.

10:49.886 --> 10:52.721
Oh, that's okay.
I'm better now.

10:53.924 --> 10:55.757
So, where are we
going to dinner?

10:55.759 --> 10:57.792
I don't know.
You made the plans.

10:57.794 --> 10:59.027
Oh, right.

11:00.464 --> 11:01.596
Uh...

11:07.536 --> 11:10.572
Let's start walking.
Maybe it'll come to me.

11:32.028 --> 11:34.329
Okay, so, if you sub

11:34.331 --> 11:36.598
at my school,
you can't wear that dress.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.867
There's no way
the kids could concentrate,

11:38.869 --> 11:41.503
and our test scores
are low enough as it is.

11:41.505 --> 11:43.405
That's what all this
is about, you know.

11:43.407 --> 11:45.407
I'm just schmoozing you
to get subbing gigs.

11:45.409 --> 11:46.875
Well, it's working.

11:46.877 --> 11:49.077
Tomorrow morning I'm firing
the first teacher I see.

11:49.079 --> 11:51.913
Actually, all these side jobs

11:51.915 --> 11:54.549
are just ways so I can
make some extra money.

11:54.551 --> 11:56.651
I want to open
my own dance school.

11:56.653 --> 11:59.087
Wow. That's fantastic.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.856
And you do have
the perfect background.

12:01.858 --> 12:04.926
Danced all over the world,
trained in ballet,

12:04.928 --> 12:07.762
jazz, tap, hip-hop.

12:09.065 --> 12:11.833
I studied your resume.

12:13.003 --> 12:15.036
To be honest,
it confused me a little.

12:15.038 --> 12:17.639
You were dancing
in vienna last year,

12:17.641 --> 12:20.442
and now you're in San Pedro?

12:20.444 --> 12:22.844
Well, um, I came back home

12:22.846 --> 12:25.413
to be near my family,
and I realized

12:25.415 --> 12:27.549
that I really enjoy teaching.

12:28.551 --> 12:30.418
Nothing wrong with teaching.

12:33.789 --> 12:35.824
I will miss traveling though.

12:35.826 --> 12:39.394
No doubt. Geez. Is there
any place you haven't been?

12:39.396 --> 12:42.464
Thailand. That is the one place
I have always wanted to go.

12:42.466 --> 12:43.932
Me too.

12:43.934 --> 12:46.368
Really? You've always
wanted to go to Thailand?

12:46.370 --> 12:48.036
Well, not always.
It started about

12:48.038 --> 12:50.472
three seconds ago when
you said you wanted to go,

12:50.474 --> 12:52.807
and I imagined
going there with you.

12:54.811 --> 12:57.412
She's amazing.
She loves kids.

12:57.414 --> 13:00.014
She's smart, sexy, funny,

13:00.016 --> 13:04.119
kind, creative, punctual,
an early riser,

13:04.121 --> 13:05.920
likes tea, a Christmas baby.

13:05.922 --> 13:08.490
Okay, I get it, man!

13:08.492 --> 13:10.759
I knew your luck
would turn around.

13:10.761 --> 13:12.627
The law of averages
and whatnot.

13:12.629 --> 13:14.062
Incoming.

13:22.405 --> 13:27.409
So, what happened? We
were playing kickball.

13:27.411 --> 13:28.669
He was the pitcher and
I was the kicker... I

13:28.695 --> 13:29.844
kicked the ball, it
bounced off a rock...

13:29.846 --> 13:32.147
and on accident it hit his face... ...And
while he did it, when no one was looking...

13:32.149 --> 13:33.915
he threw the ball at my face. ...As he was
walking towards me I saw a bug on him...

13:33.917 --> 13:35.617
all right, all right,
all right.

13:35.619 --> 13:37.118
I've heard enough.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.754
Now listen.

13:39.756 --> 13:42.957
Once and for all,
you guys need to understand

13:42.959 --> 13:46.494
how much better it would be
if the two of you were friends.

13:48.598 --> 13:49.864
Uh...

13:49.866 --> 13:53.601
You both play baseball.
And not only that,

13:53.603 --> 13:56.171
you could share all
of each other's stuff.

13:56.173 --> 14:00.175
Matt, how many series 6 and 7
lego mini figures do you have?

14:00.177 --> 14:02.777
Seventeen.
And Shane?

14:02.779 --> 14:03.912
Nine.

14:03.914 --> 14:05.647
So if you pooled together

14:05.649 --> 14:08.183
all those mini figures,
how many would you have?

14:08.185 --> 14:09.551
Six?

14:10.786 --> 14:12.720
Okay, here's another benefit of

14:12.722 --> 14:15.623
Shane can
help you with your math.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.525
You forgot to carry the one.

14:17.527 --> 14:20.662
So, do we have a deal?
No more nipple whipples?

14:20.664 --> 14:22.564
Okay.
No more nipp-whips.

14:22.566 --> 14:24.499
All right.

14:29.939 --> 14:32.974
Wow. You are fabulous
with these kids.

14:32.976 --> 14:35.743
Oh, thank you.
It's a labor of love.

14:35.745 --> 14:38.246
So, this is a nice surprise.

14:38.248 --> 14:40.949
Yeah. Timmy, um,
forgot his volcano

14:40.951 --> 14:42.650
and my sister's
stuck at the office,

14:42.652 --> 14:44.018
so she asked me to bring it in.

14:44.020 --> 14:45.954
He's a great kid.

14:45.956 --> 14:48.122
It's too bad you're
destroying his education.

14:48.124 --> 14:50.658
I am? Because his
principal cannot

14:50.660 --> 14:52.060
run his school.

14:52.062 --> 14:54.095
He keeps wishing one of
his teachers would get sick

14:54.097 --> 14:55.897
so he can call you in to sub.

14:55.899 --> 14:58.032
There are other ways that
we could see each other.

14:58.034 --> 15:00.235
Plant drugs on
the music teacher?

15:00.237 --> 15:04.172
Or... you know, we could make
a date for tomorrow night.

15:04.174 --> 15:05.740
That works too.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.909
Can I take you to
my favorite little spot?

15:07.911 --> 15:10.778
You may.

15:10.780 --> 15:13.615
Attention, students
of Lincoln elementary.

15:13.617 --> 15:16.117
Meet me in the cafeteria
in five minutes.

15:16.119 --> 15:18.786
Free ice cream for everyone!

15:21.991 --> 15:25.560
Except the diabetics.
You guys get a half day.

15:34.236 --> 15:35.904
And down.

15:41.944 --> 15:43.645
And...

15:49.552 --> 15:52.921
Thought you said you were taking
me to your favorite restaurant.

15:52.923 --> 15:55.823
I said my favorite spot,

15:55.825 --> 15:57.625
which this is.

16:00.696 --> 16:03.131
Is this...

16:03.133 --> 16:05.233
Oh, God. Is this
supposed to be Thailand?

16:05.235 --> 16:06.968
What do you think?

16:08.905 --> 16:10.638
I-I think...

16:10.640 --> 16:13.041
I've never seen anything
like it. How long did it...

16:13.043 --> 16:14.842
I had to take
a half day off of work,

16:14.844 --> 16:16.311
but don't worry about it.

16:16.313 --> 16:20.214
I haven't taken a day off in,
like, nine years, so...

16:22.685 --> 16:23.851
Muay ping?

17:14.104 --> 17:16.237
It says she has
an early flight to Vegas

17:16.239 --> 17:18.239
to visit her sick
grandmother. So what?

17:18.241 --> 17:21.976
People's grandparents tend to
live in Florida, not Vegas.

17:21.978 --> 17:24.811
Unless her grandmother
is Celine Dion.

17:24.814 --> 17:26.914
You're only suspicious
because of all the things

17:26.915 --> 17:28.783
that have happened in the past.

17:28.785 --> 17:30.351
You got nothing to worry about.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.687
Look, she even signed the
letter with a little heart.

17:32.689 --> 17:34.255
That's not a heart,
that's a mushroom.

17:34.257 --> 17:37.258
- It's not a mushroom.
- A boxing glove?

17:37.260 --> 17:40.395
It's not a boxing glove.
A chef's hat?

17:40.397 --> 17:42.797
That's probably her
own little salutation.

17:42.799 --> 17:45.366
I bet she signs all of her
letters "chef's hat, Molly."

17:45.368 --> 17:47.068
No, not all of her letters.

17:47.070 --> 17:49.404
Just the ones where
she's blowing someone off.

17:49.406 --> 17:53.708
A blow-off letter wouldn't have
a smiley face inside of the "o."

17:53.710 --> 17:56.944
The lips turn down at the end.
That is a frowny face.

17:56.946 --> 17:59.947
Charlie, come on. Look, I don't
know what to think anymore.

17:59.949 --> 18:02.450
I need some peace of mind.
Maybe I should just call her.

18:02.452 --> 18:06.020
If you call her it's like
you're checking up on her.

18:06.022 --> 18:09.290
What I should do is send
the grandmother a fruit basket.

18:09.292 --> 18:10.758
Or maybe you shouldn't.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.694
If I send grandma
a get-well-soon gift

18:12.696 --> 18:15.063
and if by some miracle
Molly really is there,

18:15.065 --> 18:16.798
then she'll call to thank me.

18:16.800 --> 18:18.800
I guess it couldn't
hurt to send

18:18.802 --> 18:21.269
to send the suck-up fruit basket.
Exactly!

18:21.271 --> 18:23.738
What's better? Should I order
a lot of one kind of fruit,

18:23.740 --> 18:25.740
or some kind of an assortment?

18:25.742 --> 18:27.008
A thousand cantaloupes?

18:27.010 --> 18:28.209
Cantaloupes?

18:28.211 --> 18:30.712
Or its sister melon,
the crenshaw?

18:30.714 --> 18:33.014
Look. I'm joking, okay?

18:33.016 --> 18:37.118
Send the fruit basket,
spend $50 tops. Okay.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.087
Don't overdo it. I
won't, I won't.

18:39.089 --> 18:40.221
Thanks, Jay.

18:59.409 --> 19:03.444
Hello. Today I'm going to tell
you why my three American heroes

19:03.446 --> 19:08.116
are Abraham Lincoln,
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

19:08.118 --> 19:10.218
And principal
Charles Winston darby.

19:15.758 --> 19:17.792
Am I gonna have to
take this away from you?

19:17.794 --> 19:20.394
According to the good folks
at the sin city fruit barn,

19:20.396 --> 19:22.230
the cantaloupes arrived
23 minutes ago.

19:22.232 --> 19:23.397
Shh!

19:23.399 --> 19:25.099
Stick it, Amy.

19:25.101 --> 19:27.235
Hey. Stop obsessing
over this!

19:27.237 --> 19:29.103
I'm not obsessing.

19:29.105 --> 19:31.506
While he was
president, Abraham...

20:03.338 --> 20:05.807
Mrs. finkelstein, I'm taking
Timmy down to the office.

20:05.809 --> 20:07.909
He put his scissors
in the paste.

20:07.911 --> 20:09.544
No, I didn't.
You did!

20:09.546 --> 20:11.245
Timmy, at this school

20:11.247 --> 20:13.815
we do not blame others
for our mistakes.

20:13.817 --> 20:15.149
Let's go.

20:18.153 --> 20:20.188
You used to be my hero.

20:21.857 --> 20:25.126
So, what would
cause him to act out like that?

20:25.128 --> 20:26.594
Sick grandparent perhaps?

20:26.596 --> 20:29.497
No. All of his grandparents
are doing just fine.

20:29.499 --> 20:31.365
Granny's not on her last legs?

20:31.367 --> 20:33.434
No. Is she still on solid foods?

20:33.436 --> 20:35.903
Sorry, I'm-I'm not sure
what you're talking about.

20:35.905 --> 20:38.172
No, I'm sorry. I'm just
grasping for something.

20:38.174 --> 20:39.907
This is so atypical of Timmy.

20:39.909 --> 20:42.109
I've never known him
to destroy school property.

20:42.111 --> 20:43.978
Well, I didn't do anything!

20:43.980 --> 20:46.180
Principal darby stuck
the scissors in the paste!

20:46.182 --> 20:49.450
And now you're lying to us.
You're out of the cub scouts.

20:49.452 --> 20:51.485
Oh, I'm not sure
that's necessary.

20:51.487 --> 20:53.621
But I love the cub scouts!

20:53.623 --> 20:57.892
He seems pretty emotional.
Are you sure nobody's dying?

20:57.894 --> 20:59.961
Nobody in our family is dying!

20:59.963 --> 21:02.263
Oh.

21:15.879 --> 21:19.647
Okay. Who can tell me the names
of the first three presidents?

21:19.649 --> 21:21.949
Washington, Adams,
Jefferson. Easy!

21:21.951 --> 21:24.285
Mr. savoli, can I speak
to you for a second?

21:24.287 --> 21:26.621
All right, uh, start
reading chapter two, kids.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.556
I'll be right back.

21:28.558 --> 21:30.992
So it turns out Molly
really did go to Vegas,

21:30.994 --> 21:32.460
but not to visit
her grandmother.

21:32.462 --> 21:34.095
The old lady's in fine health.

21:34.097 --> 21:35.429
Really?
Yes.

21:35.431 --> 21:37.965
The family confirmed
that for me.

21:39.501 --> 21:42.169
So I did a little digging
and I found out the truth.

21:42.171 --> 21:44.472
She went to Vegas
to visit her boyfriend.

21:44.474 --> 21:46.974
He's a musician. His band
is playing at the hard rock.

21:46.976 --> 21:49.977
<i>Okay, so, in retrospect, a
few follow-up questions</i>

21:49.979 --> 21:51.646
<i>might have been
a good idea, like,</i>

21:51.648 --> 21:53.648
<i>"what do you mean, the family
confirmed that for me?"</i>

21:53.650 --> 21:55.616
<i>Or, "what's the
boyfriend's band?"</i>

21:55.618 --> 21:58.152
<i>Or, "how did you find
this out exactly?"</i>

21:58.154 --> 22:00.688
<i>Instead, I said this.</i>

22:00.690 --> 22:04.125
Shit.
I'm so sorry, buddy.

22:04.127 --> 22:06.327
She wouldn't return my
calls, so I texted her.

22:06.329 --> 22:08.329
Told her I wasn't gonna
be some guy who just

22:08.331 --> 22:10.965
kept her company while her
boyfriend was on the road.

22:10.967 --> 22:13.501
How do I pick these women?
I'm an idiot.

22:13.503 --> 22:16.237
Hey, hey, I would've been fooled
by some of these people too.

22:16.239 --> 22:19.240
Like Michelle, I see her
at the gym, like, every day

22:19.242 --> 22:21.409
and I think, man,
she doesn't look like

22:21.411 --> 22:23.577
the kind of girl that would
run off with a rodeo clown.

22:23.579 --> 22:25.513
<i>Well, now I just
seem like an idiot,</i>

22:25.515 --> 22:27.148
<i>but think about it.</i>

22:27.150 --> 22:29.116
<i>If your best friend told
you something like this,</i>

22:29.118 --> 22:30.685
<i>your instinct
wouldn't be to question.</i>

22:30.687 --> 22:32.386
<i>Your instinct would be to help.</i>

22:32.388 --> 22:34.622
So, don't be
so hard on yourself

22:34.624 --> 22:36.590
for getting it
wrong about Molly.

22:36.592 --> 22:39.593
I-I got good vibes
from her too.

22:39.595 --> 22:41.562
Yeah, well, thanks, Jay.

22:41.564 --> 22:44.265
Look, I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm gonna go home early.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.634
I got some trinkets
to get rid of.

22:50.572 --> 22:52.573
Easy there, Philip.

22:52.575 --> 22:55.576
Don't get in too deep until you
know what she's really about.

22:55.578 --> 22:59.046
Rumor has it she's been
playing Xbox with Billy suzuki.

23:14.429 --> 23:18.032
Michelle? Jason?
What are you doing?

23:18.034 --> 23:19.734
I asked Michelle
to come here with me

23:19.736 --> 23:22.503
because this is something
you need to understand.

23:22.505 --> 23:24.772
We just had a good talk at the gym.
If this is about

23:24.774 --> 23:27.541
getting back together,
I am definitely not interested.

23:27.543 --> 23:31.245
Trust me, this is not about
us getting back together.

23:31.247 --> 23:33.314
We thought
you should read this.

23:35.117 --> 23:37.618
The neurochemical connection

23:37.620 --> 23:40.187
between romantic love
and psychosis."

23:40.189 --> 23:43.024
Nice topic. What does
that have to do with me?

23:43.026 --> 23:46.160
Let's just say you inspired it.
You're calling me crazy?

23:46.162 --> 23:49.163
Who's the one with
the clown fetish?

23:49.165 --> 23:54.101
Charlie, did you ever
actually see buckey or thunder?

23:54.103 --> 23:56.203
No. You know why?

23:56.205 --> 23:58.039
Because women don't
usually introduce you

23:58.041 --> 24:00.307
to the guy they're cheating
on you with, or his horse.

24:00.309 --> 24:02.276
Just read this, okay?

24:02.278 --> 24:04.645
You need to understand
that when you fall in love,

24:04.647 --> 24:06.280
it messes up your
brain chemistry

24:06.282 --> 24:07.782
and makes you delusional.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.084
Now I'm delusional?

24:10.086 --> 24:12.053
Michelle.

24:12.055 --> 24:13.521
When people fall in love,

24:13.523 --> 24:15.289
the brain undergoes
a transformation.

24:15.291 --> 24:16.791
Dopamine levels are elevated

24:16.793 --> 24:19.360
and serotonin levels are
diminished. That's normal.

24:19.362 --> 24:21.362
But in a few cases,
particularly in subjects

24:21.364 --> 24:23.764
with a rich imagination,
romantic disposition...

24:23.766 --> 24:25.399
People like you, basically...

24:25.401 --> 24:28.069
It's much, much worse.

24:28.071 --> 24:31.272
And love renders them,
well, technically...

24:34.209 --> 24:36.510
Psychotic.
I am not psychotic.

24:36.512 --> 24:39.280
I loved you and you loved
a clown. End of story.

24:39.282 --> 24:41.549
I'm sorry. The doctor
in me wants to help you,

24:41.551 --> 24:43.417
but I just, I don't
have time for this.

24:43.419 --> 24:46.287
Excuse me for being bitter,
but because of you I can't

24:46.289 --> 24:49.123
show my face in Montreal.
There was no reality show!

24:49.125 --> 24:51.292
Every time we went to Hollywood,
there were cameras everywhere.

24:51.294 --> 24:55.129
They're called tourists. They were
Canadian cameramen incognito.

24:55.131 --> 24:57.665
Think about it.
Canadians blend right in.

24:57.667 --> 25:00.434
I tried explaining this to him
when I was writing my paper,

25:00.436 --> 25:02.770
and he was in denial then too.
Ah.

25:02.772 --> 25:05.673
Maybe you can
get through to him.

25:05.675 --> 25:09.376
Thanks. We really
appreciate you coming by.

25:12.148 --> 25:14.115
Clown humper.

25:14.117 --> 25:17.685
No, Charlie, I'd actually say
she's the opposite of that,

25:17.687 --> 25:19.653
whatever that might be.

25:19.655 --> 25:21.889
All she did was seize
the opportunity

25:21.891 --> 25:24.658
to come over here and cover
for her indiscretions.

25:24.660 --> 25:27.461
Well, I seriously doubt that,
and I'm worried that

25:27.463 --> 25:29.363
you might have gotten it
wrong about Molly too.

25:29.365 --> 25:31.866
Molly? Molly's sleeping
with the bass player

25:31.868 --> 25:33.601
in the band
dirty little secret.

25:33.603 --> 25:35.769
That's crazy!

25:35.771 --> 25:37.505
I know.
The bass player.

25:37.507 --> 25:39.406
Women never go
for the bass player.

25:39.408 --> 25:41.909
No! No!
It's all crazy!

25:41.911 --> 25:43.811
Tell me everything you know.

25:43.813 --> 25:46.847
Well, she met the band when she
danced in one of their videos.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.649
And you know that for a fact?

25:48.651 --> 25:50.784
Molly was a dancer
and the band made a video.

25:50.786 --> 25:52.586
And?

25:52.588 --> 25:54.388
Put two and two together.
Connect the dots!

25:54.390 --> 25:57.424
What dots? I think
you're taking a giant leap!

25:57.426 --> 25:59.927
It says on her Facebook page
that she's a fan of theirs.

25:59.929 --> 26:02.763
I'm a fan of huey Lewis!
I'm not sleeping with him!

26:02.765 --> 26:06.700
Jason, read between the lines.

26:06.702 --> 26:08.802
That's code to her girlfriends

26:08.804 --> 26:11.238
to let them know
she's hooking up with him.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.908
Hell, they even wrote a song
about Molly... "hey, Lucinda."

26:13.910 --> 26:16.210
I'm no songwriter,
but wouldn't they have called

26:16.212 --> 26:17.945
a song about Molly
"hey, Molly"?

26:17.947 --> 26:20.681
N-no, no, no. They never
use the real names.

26:20.683 --> 26:23.684
"Long tall Sally" was
about a woman named Joan

26:23.686 --> 26:26.487
who was actually short and fat.

26:26.489 --> 26:29.456
But "short fat Joan"
didn't have a ring to it.

26:29.458 --> 26:31.725
Trust me,
the song is about her.

26:31.727 --> 26:34.461
"Lucinda walks like a lady
but cries like a baby"?

26:34.463 --> 26:36.263
That describes Molly to a "t"!

26:37.299 --> 26:38.432
G...

26:40.869 --> 26:42.937
I-I didn't mean
to startle you

26:42.939 --> 26:46.407
by popping in like this, but
I think I left my phone here.

26:46.409 --> 26:48.375
Holy shit.

26:48.377 --> 26:50.945
It's no big deal.
It was strange at first,

26:50.947 --> 26:53.714
but then I kind of liked being
away from calls and emails

26:53.716 --> 26:55.683
for a few days.

26:55.685 --> 26:57.518
Can I help you look for it?

26:57.520 --> 27:01.855
Oh, uh, I have a friend over.

27:01.857 --> 27:05.593
We're in the middle of talking.
His wife threw him out.

27:05.595 --> 27:07.528
He's an asshole.
Yikes.

27:07.530 --> 27:09.496
Well, I'll wait here then?

27:09.498 --> 27:11.765
Good idea.
He's a little testy.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.601
Uh, I'll be right back.

27:16.671 --> 27:18.572
You forgot to ask her
how her orgy was.

27:18.574 --> 27:20.574
Not now. I gotta
find that phone.

27:30.720 --> 27:33.420
The roof. I'll bet
it's on the roof!

27:39.995 --> 27:41.629
I got it.

27:41.631 --> 27:43.597
I just gotta delete
my messages.

27:43.599 --> 27:45.733
How many?

27:47.435 --> 27:48.636
Nice.

27:48.638 --> 27:50.704
No, not all of
these are from me.

27:53.408 --> 27:54.908
Two are from her mother.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.646
Hey. Sorry to
take so long,

27:58.648 --> 28:01.515
but Jason had another meltdown.

28:01.517 --> 28:04.551
He's a mess of a human.
I hope he's okay.

28:04.553 --> 28:06.687
Oh, he'll bounce back.
He always does.

28:06.689 --> 28:08.756
That's good.
Mmm.

28:08.758 --> 28:10.658
So, um, quick thing.
Hmm?

28:10.660 --> 28:14.061
And this is-this is nuts,
but I won a trip to LA jolla

28:14.063 --> 28:17.364
and I was gonna
use it this weekend.

28:17.366 --> 28:19.867
I was wondering if
you'd like to come with me.

28:20.935 --> 28:24.338
Wow. O-okay.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.540
S-sure. Absolutely.
Sounds good.

28:26.542 --> 28:28.842
Right on.

28:28.844 --> 28:31.745
I'll take that as a yes? Yeah.

28:36.584 --> 28:38.886
I'll see you Friday. Yeah.

28:53.369 --> 28:54.535
This...

28:56.871 --> 28:58.906
Is mind blowing.

28:58.908 --> 29:01.108
Whoa! Easy there.

29:01.110 --> 29:03.344
This is great news!

29:06.047 --> 29:08.716
You were wrong about
your other girlfriends.

29:08.718 --> 29:10.851
It wasn't you
versus some other dude,

29:10.853 --> 29:13.987
it was you
versus your own mind.

29:13.989 --> 29:17.057
So I'm not a loser with
women, but I'm nuts?

29:17.059 --> 29:20.027
Either way I should
just pack it in.

29:20.029 --> 29:22.363
No. Charlie.

29:22.365 --> 29:24.465
You can do this.

29:24.467 --> 29:27.468
You can fall in love
and not go crazy.

29:27.470 --> 29:29.069
<i>So when you think about it,</i>

29:29.071 --> 29:30.838
<i>this is really
a lot to take in.</i>

29:30.840 --> 29:33.407
<i>It's like you're reading
your own autobiography</i>

29:33.409 --> 29:35.642
<i>and suddenly you realize
that nine chapters</i>

29:35.644 --> 29:37.411
<i>were written by a lunatic,</i>

29:37.413 --> 29:39.480
<i>and that lunatic</i>

29:39.482 --> 29:41.882
<i>turned out to be you.</i>

29:41.884 --> 29:44.485
So, I told my Nana about you.

29:44.487 --> 29:47.121
You did? I was planning
on telling her anyway,

29:47.123 --> 29:48.956
but you didn't
give me a choice.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.759
The cantaloupes filled up
her entire basement.

29:53.662 --> 29:55.429
What was up with that?

29:55.431 --> 29:57.898
Been meaning to tell you, um,

29:57.900 --> 30:00.701
there was a mishap at
the sin city fruit barn.

30:00.703 --> 30:02.836
They mixed my order up
with somebody else's.

30:02.838 --> 30:05.839
Next thing you know,
I have a $3,000 charge

30:05.841 --> 30:08.142
for cantaloupes!
This has gotten ugly.

30:08.144 --> 30:10.778
Citibank's involved
and everything. Oh!

30:10.780 --> 30:13.447
I mean, I figured it was some
kind of mistake. Mm-hmm.

30:13.449 --> 30:16.483
You know? Only a lunatic would
send a thousand cantaloupes.

30:17.485 --> 30:18.719
Exactly.

30:36.905 --> 30:38.906
"Quilting." Q is 20

30:38.908 --> 30:41.208
with a double letter,
plus eight is 28

30:41.210 --> 30:44.044
with a triple word is 84,

30:44.046 --> 30:46.046
plus the 50-point
bonus is...

30:46.048 --> 30:48.182
One thirty-four.

30:48.184 --> 30:50.651
One thirty-four.

30:50.653 --> 30:52.653
I'm kicking your ass.

30:52.655 --> 30:56.056
Yeah, well, all that
is about to change.

30:56.058 --> 30:59.460
"Zaxpult."
30, 31, 51.

30:59.462 --> 31:02.596
Hold on.
What's a zaxpult?

31:02.598 --> 31:05.766
It's a small, flat shoe worn
by Mexican peasant boys.

31:05.768 --> 31:08.869
You mean to tell me you've
never heard of a zaxpult?

31:08.871 --> 31:11.605
Cheater! Well, I wouldn't
have to cheat if

31:11.607 --> 31:14.007
you weren't some kind
of scrabble savant.

32:11.065 --> 32:13.567
I need some
information, please,

32:13.569 --> 32:15.836
handsome concierge.

32:15.838 --> 32:19.172
And I would like to bury
my head in your bosom,

32:19.174 --> 32:20.741
hotel guest.

32:20.743 --> 32:23.844
And bury it you shall,
you silly boy.

32:23.846 --> 32:26.980
I like the way you fill out
your uniform, Horatio.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.008
Oh!
Hey.

32:56.946 --> 33:01.048
"I like the way you fill out
your uniform, Horatio."

33:03.985 --> 33:08.055
Uh, that's a note
I wrote to the concierge.

33:08.057 --> 33:10.591
Why?
Uh, you know,

33:10.593 --> 33:13.193
they never seem to get
enough compliments.

33:13.195 --> 33:15.896
Okay. Well, his name's
not Horatio, it's Bob.

33:15.898 --> 33:18.832
You met him? You can meet him too.
He's right downstairs.

33:18.834 --> 33:20.701
Oh, I wouldn't
know what to say,

33:20.703 --> 33:22.302
what, with him being
so handsome and all.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.237
Sounds like you have
a crush on him.

33:24.239 --> 33:25.973
No. No.

33:25.975 --> 33:29.042
I've never even met
big Bob the concierge.

33:29.044 --> 33:31.345
Just admired him
from afar, unlike you,

33:31.347 --> 33:34.081
who was blessed with
meeting him personally.

33:34.083 --> 33:36.950
I wouldn't call it a blessing.
I mean, he rented bikes for us.

33:36.952 --> 33:38.752
You two are going
for a bike ride?

33:38.754 --> 33:41.054
Yeah, I'm going bike riding
with the concierge.

33:41.056 --> 33:43.690
Fine. Then you won't mind if I
ask the maid to go for a swim.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.895
I'm sorry.

33:48.897 --> 33:51.865
Why are you acting so weird?

33:54.135 --> 33:57.671
I'm sorry. I-I think
it's my blood sugar.

33:57.673 --> 33:59.239
If I don't eat in a while,

33:59.241 --> 34:01.642
I start to feel
a little, uh, strange.

34:01.644 --> 34:05.178
Hmm. Wow. Go get
yourself a cookie.

34:05.180 --> 34:07.280
I'm gonna change.
Okay.

34:18.693 --> 34:22.329
Yeah, I'm just checking on my
bicycle reservations for today.

34:22.331 --> 34:24.831
Charlie darby.

34:24.833 --> 34:27.000
You don't have
a reservation for me.

34:27.002 --> 34:28.835
Well, eat me!

34:30.672 --> 34:33.674
Oh, I'm listed under
Molly Kingston?

34:33.676 --> 34:36.309
Wonderful. Thank you.
Don't eat me.

34:48.222 --> 34:49.889
This is amazing.

34:49.891 --> 34:51.757
You know who I think
would really enjoy this?

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
If you bring up the
concierge one more time,

34:53.762 --> 34:55.195
you're walking back.

34:55.197 --> 34:56.996
Point made.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.965
Can we pull over for a sec?

35:00.268 --> 35:02.402
Can you grab us some waters?

35:02.404 --> 35:05.072
Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay.
I'll, uh, be right back.

35:05.074 --> 35:06.707
Great.

35:13.281 --> 35:15.716
Hey.

35:24.393 --> 35:25.826
You look great.

35:27.495 --> 35:29.496
What have you been up to?

35:29.498 --> 35:32.265
The same old
stuff. Ouch!

35:32.267 --> 35:34.401
Oh, my God.
Charlie!

35:37.205 --> 35:39.873
Hey! Oh, my God. Are you okay?
Hey.

35:39.875 --> 35:43.243
Yeah. I'm s-sorry.
Didn't mean to show off.

35:43.245 --> 35:45.312
It looks like you
fell off the bike.

35:45.314 --> 35:46.980
Yeah, to the naked eye, yeah,

35:46.982 --> 35:49.182
but in actuality
I was performing a stunt.

35:49.184 --> 35:51.351
Well, it was, uh, awesome.

35:51.353 --> 35:53.353
Okay.
This is Josh.

35:53.355 --> 35:55.355
We went to high
school together.

35:55.357 --> 35:57.858
Oh. Were you
guys fuckies?

35:57.860 --> 36:00.360
Buddies? Were
you guys buddies?

36:00.362 --> 36:03.096
This is bleeding really bad.

36:03.098 --> 36:05.298
You sure you're okay? Yeah.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.835
Pretty nasty spill. We should
probably get you to first aid.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.203
Yeah.
All right. Oh.

36:10.205 --> 36:11.505
Come on.

36:11.507 --> 36:13.874
Watch your step. Easy. Okay.

36:13.876 --> 36:16.042
Go on in there.
Here.

36:17.212 --> 36:18.378
Ooh!

36:18.380 --> 36:20.380
Gimmie the foot.
That's it.

36:22.484 --> 36:24.785
All right, I'm right
behind you, okay?

36:24.787 --> 36:26.353
You-you're
not coming?

36:26.355 --> 36:28.955
Oh, don't I have to
deal with the bike?

36:28.957 --> 36:30.423
Oh. Oh.

36:30.425 --> 36:32.893
Josh could deal with the bike.

36:32.895 --> 36:34.995
Sure, I'll take
care of the bike.

36:34.997 --> 36:37.230
I can give you a lift
to first aid as well.

36:37.232 --> 36:39.499
Okay. Uh, you know what?
I'm all right.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.434
I'm all right.
I'll just, uh,

36:41.436 --> 36:43.370
I'll use my shirt
as a tourniquet.

36:43.372 --> 36:45.138
I don't think
that's a good idea.

36:45.140 --> 36:47.140
Uh, if I bleed out,
I bleed out.

36:47.142 --> 36:49.142
One thing you'll come to
learn about me is that I have

36:49.144 --> 36:51.144
an incredibly high
tolerance for pain.

36:51.146 --> 36:54.147
That's enough! You're the most
jealous person I've ever seen.

36:54.149 --> 36:56.516
I mean, you'd rather die
than leave me alone with Josh.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.185
I am not going to die.

36:58.187 --> 37:01.521
Worst case scenario,
I end up in a coma.

37:05.893 --> 37:08.361
I hate jealousy, Charlie.

37:08.363 --> 37:10.063
So just relax.

37:10.065 --> 37:12.332
I mean, obviously
I really like you,

37:12.334 --> 37:15.268
or I wouldn't have
taken you away.

37:15.270 --> 37:18.905
And for your information,
Josh and I were never fuckies.

37:18.907 --> 37:21.241
Well, I wouldn't
blame you if you were.

37:21.243 --> 37:24.344
Hell, I wouldn't mind
being his fuckie.

37:24.346 --> 37:26.613
Molly, all men are jealous.
Not like this.

37:26.615 --> 37:29.583
He was jealous of me
talking to the concierge.

37:29.585 --> 37:32.385
I mean, really he acted
kind of weird all weekend.

37:32.387 --> 37:35.055
See, I think because
Charlie's such a great guy,

37:35.057 --> 37:38.358
you're expecting him to
be perfect, but he is not.

37:38.360 --> 37:41.561
No one is, so stop
expecting him to be.

37:41.563 --> 37:44.164
A big part of love
is acceptance.

37:44.166 --> 37:47.167
Spoken like a woman who's
been married for ten years.

37:47.169 --> 37:49.135
Exactly.

37:49.137 --> 37:52.005
You know, will does some shit

37:52.007 --> 37:54.107
that drives me out of my mind.

37:54.109 --> 37:57.544
But I know that he's
a really great person.

37:57.546 --> 37:59.246
So is Charlie.

37:59.248 --> 38:01.281
Yeah. No, I guess
you're right.

38:01.283 --> 38:03.216
Molly, he's amazing.

38:03.218 --> 38:06.052
He's smart,
he's funny, he's cute.

38:06.054 --> 38:08.188
Honestly I think he's like
the most stable person

38:08.190 --> 38:10.023
you have ever gone out with.

38:10.025 --> 38:12.092
And I thought that
having self-awareness

38:12.094 --> 38:14.628
would change things.
Man, was I wrong.

38:14.630 --> 38:17.430
That's what we call
insight fallacy.

38:17.432 --> 38:20.100
Just because a patient has
self-awareness about something

38:20.102 --> 38:22.135
doesn't mean they can
automatically change it.

38:22.137 --> 38:24.371
I mean, to a certain extent
it's out of your control.

38:24.373 --> 38:26.473
It's like someone trying
to quit a drug addiction.

38:26.475 --> 38:28.575
Yeah. Like with Horatio.

38:28.577 --> 38:31.511
I wanted to walk away,
but I couldn't.

38:31.513 --> 38:34.347
Of course not.
Let me ask you something.

38:34.349 --> 38:37.284
And please don't
answer in any detail.

38:37.286 --> 38:40.420
What were your first
experiences with girls like?

38:40.422 --> 38:43.156
In a word, rejection.

38:43.158 --> 38:45.625
I guess it all started when
I was like three and a half.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.594
Okay, that's it.
Look.

38:47.596 --> 38:50.363
Clearly you're dealing with
some self-esteem issues,

38:50.365 --> 38:53.967
and that's as much diagnosis
as I feel comfortable with.

38:53.969 --> 38:56.102
Plus, you're my boss.

38:56.104 --> 38:58.004
And I specialize
in 12 and under.

38:58.006 --> 38:59.639
I respect that.

38:59.641 --> 39:02.309
So... this is it.

39:02.311 --> 39:04.377
This one.
Yeah.

39:05.413 --> 39:06.646
Yeah.

39:06.648 --> 39:08.581
What do you think?

39:08.583 --> 39:10.951
I like it.
You do?

39:10.953 --> 39:12.118
Yeah.

39:13.521 --> 39:16.389
Oh, I can see it.

39:16.391 --> 39:19.726
I see San Pedro's
most successful dance school.

39:23.131 --> 39:24.431
Sorry.

39:30.304 --> 39:32.305
Oh. Sorry,
I have to grab this.

39:32.307 --> 39:34.107
Oh, sure.
Excuse me.

39:34.109 --> 39:35.275
Hello?

39:36.444 --> 39:37.577
Hey.

39:39.413 --> 39:40.547
Yeah.

39:56.263 --> 39:58.331
Son of a bitch. Oh.

39:58.333 --> 40:00.533
What?
It just hit me.

40:00.535 --> 40:04.037
I totally forgot to bring back
any souvenirs from LA jolla.

40:04.039 --> 40:06.373
Oh. How about you?

40:06.375 --> 40:09.676
You bring back any doodads for
a special friend you may have?

40:10.711 --> 40:13.546
No. Why?

40:13.548 --> 40:15.081
Uh...

40:16.450 --> 40:18.485
She smuggled back
a gift from LA jolla,

40:18.487 --> 40:21.021
a sweatshirt for
a guy, a big guy.

40:21.023 --> 40:23.556
What big guy?
I don't know.

40:23.558 --> 40:26.159
At first I thought it was for
someone named Randy hopper,

40:26.161 --> 40:28.695
but I ran Molly's family tree
and it turns out

40:28.697 --> 40:30.497
she and hopper
are first cousins.

40:30.499 --> 40:32.232
Unless they're kissing cousins.

40:32.234 --> 40:35.702
I also thought about
big Bob, the concierge.

40:35.704 --> 40:38.238
But it puzzles me why
she'd get something for him

40:38.240 --> 40:41.307
when he gets a 30%
employee discount on clothing.

40:45.446 --> 40:48.715
Charlie, I think it might be a
good idea for you to tell Molly

40:48.717 --> 40:51.484
about your condition.
Oh, sure, great idea.

40:51.486 --> 40:53.787
That wouldn't freak
her out or anything.

40:53.789 --> 40:57.190
I don't know. I think, um,
I think it would be better

40:57.192 --> 40:59.626
if she understood what you
were going through. Look.

40:59.628 --> 41:02.395
I'm not even being crazy here.
I saw the shirt.

41:02.397 --> 41:04.264
I felt its soft,
cottony fabric.

41:04.266 --> 41:06.733
Why would she deny having it
unless it was for someone

41:06.735 --> 41:08.468
she didn't want me
to know about?

41:08.470 --> 41:10.236
It has to be for someone.

41:10.238 --> 41:12.539
I can guarantee
I know who it's for.

41:15.810 --> 41:18.211
It's a very sweet thing
you want to meet my dad.

41:18.213 --> 41:19.612
Oh.
Daddy.

41:19.614 --> 41:21.347
Hey, hey, hey.

41:21.349 --> 41:23.116
Hey, I... hi.

41:23.118 --> 41:24.417
Oh.

41:24.419 --> 41:26.419
Okay, okay. Okay.

41:26.421 --> 41:29.089
That was quite some hug, son.

41:29.091 --> 41:31.291
Well, there's more
where that came from.

41:31.293 --> 41:33.426
Huh. Hey, mol.
Hi.

41:34.596 --> 41:36.196
All right, now what?

41:37.298 --> 41:38.531
Oh, sorry.

41:38.533 --> 41:40.667
I was going for the sandwich.

41:44.538 --> 41:47.807
Ooh. Ooh.
I just got a chill.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.442
It's a little cold in here.

41:49.444 --> 41:51.244
Oh. Let's see.

41:53.247 --> 41:55.882
It's 83 degrees.

41:55.884 --> 41:58.251
Well, I guess
it's just me then.

41:58.253 --> 42:00.320
We darbys are a
thin-blooded tribe.

42:00.322 --> 42:01.821
Well, I'm roasting,

42:01.823 --> 42:04.290
I mean, especially with
the fireplace going.

42:04.292 --> 42:05.758
Yes, dear, but,

42:05.760 --> 42:07.460
Charlie's our guest

42:07.462 --> 42:09.829
and if he's cold, uh,
I can crank it up to 87.

42:09.831 --> 42:11.731
Oh, that's awfully kind of you,

42:11.733 --> 42:13.800
but perhaps you could provide
some immediate relief.

42:13.802 --> 42:16.136
Might you have a sweatshirt
I could borrow?

42:16.138 --> 42:18.605
I'll get you a sweater.
I'd prefer a sweatshirt.

42:18.607 --> 42:20.673
If you have anything 50 poly,

42:20.675 --> 42:23.676
50 cotton, battleship gray
with a cute slogan,

42:23.678 --> 42:25.612
that'd be nice.
Charlie.

42:25.614 --> 42:28.515
Oh, sorry.
It's an allergy thing.

42:28.517 --> 42:31.818
I can give you my snuggie. I don't
want a snuggie, I want a sweatshirt.

42:35.323 --> 42:36.456
Wow.

42:37.658 --> 42:39.559
I'm... so sorry.

42:39.561 --> 42:41.528
I didn't mean to fly off
the handle like that.

42:41.530 --> 42:43.730
I-I think I'm just
a little anxious

42:43.732 --> 42:46.366
meeting someone's parents
for the first time.

42:46.368 --> 42:48.301
It could be a bit of
a tense situation.

42:48.303 --> 42:49.903
Of course, I-I'll
get you a sweater.

42:49.905 --> 42:51.304
Sweatshirt.

42:55.910 --> 42:57.644
Are you okay?

42:57.646 --> 42:59.546
You look like you're
sweating up a storm.

42:59.548 --> 43:02.582
I'm a little warmer now.
Thank you.

43:02.584 --> 43:03.716
Oh.

43:13.360 --> 43:16.896
Uh, if you'll excuse me,
I'll just use the restroom.

43:25.339 --> 43:28.474
I'm sorry. I don't know
why he's acting like this.

43:28.476 --> 43:32.612
I'll tell you why.
Because he really likes you.

43:32.614 --> 43:35.448
That's why he's so nervous.

43:35.450 --> 43:37.383
You know, I sweated up a storm

43:37.385 --> 43:39.519
when I met your mother's parents.
Hmm, yeah.

43:39.521 --> 43:42.922
Well, not nearly to the degree
that Charlie's sweating.

43:42.924 --> 43:45.959
I have never seen anyone
sweat that much.

43:47.395 --> 43:50.563
So, you guys actually like him.
Well,

43:50.565 --> 43:53.399
from a parent's perspective,
he's wonderful.

43:53.401 --> 43:56.569
He's a gentleman,
he's got a good job,

43:56.571 --> 43:59.639
and he's a real pillar
of our community.

44:02.643 --> 44:04.344
It was my first
time meeting him.

44:04.346 --> 44:05.878
Second time
we touch very little.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.880
In a perfect world, not at all.

44:07.882 --> 44:10.416
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

44:12.386 --> 44:14.654
I think you're amazing.

44:14.656 --> 44:17.957
I think this thing
between us is amazing.

44:17.959 --> 44:20.960
But sometimes I want
it to work so badly

44:20.962 --> 44:23.930
that I succumb to
the pressure and I

44:23.932 --> 44:25.898
act like an idiot.

44:27.601 --> 44:29.535
Well...

44:29.537 --> 44:31.537
I mean, you're a cute idiot.

44:33.540 --> 44:35.708
Believe it or not,
my parents actually

44:35.710 --> 44:37.610
like you, especially my dad.

44:37.612 --> 44:41.047
Obviously. Or he wouldn't have
let me get to second base.

44:45.486 --> 44:47.820
<i>Woman moaning)</i>

44:49.323 --> 44:51.024
Oh. I-I know I'm

44:51.026 --> 44:52.725
abusing my key privileges,

44:52.727 --> 44:55.361
and you'll find a, uh,
charge on your cable bill

44:55.363 --> 44:57.063
next month for
"forrest hump."

44:57.065 --> 44:58.931
It's valid.

44:58.933 --> 45:01.701
W-wait, wait.

45:01.703 --> 45:04.404
There's something
you can help me with.

45:04.406 --> 45:07.774
Excellent. I am your
spiritual advisor.

45:07.776 --> 45:10.476
Self-appointed, yes.
I'll put the coffee on.

45:10.478 --> 45:13.446
<i>Life is like a box of condoms.</i>

45:16.917 --> 45:20.486
So, have you ever been
diagnosed as being insane?

45:20.488 --> 45:24.057
Diagnosed? No. But it's safe to
assume you've had some sanity issues.

45:24.059 --> 45:25.658
Very safe, yes.

45:25.660 --> 45:27.660
Here's what I can't figure out.

45:27.662 --> 45:29.829
How can you differentiate
between when

45:29.831 --> 45:32.565
you're being crazy versus when

45:32.567 --> 45:34.867
something crazy is
actually happening to you?

45:34.869 --> 45:36.969
Brother,

45:36.971 --> 45:39.872
I-I wrestle with that one
every day of my life.

45:39.874 --> 45:42.742
But I will say this.
Just because you're crazy

45:42.744 --> 45:45.478
doesn't make you immune from
crazy things happening to you.

45:45.480 --> 45:46.979
That's exactly
the way I see it!

45:48.115 --> 45:50.583
What's going on?
Let me in.

45:51.753 --> 45:52.952
It's just that...

45:54.421 --> 45:56.589
I think I'm competing
with another guy.

45:56.591 --> 45:58.691
Well, I'm sure you're not
pulling that out of thin air.

45:58.693 --> 46:00.493
W-what's your gut
telling you?

46:00.495 --> 46:02.628
My gut's telling me
that someone from her past

46:02.630 --> 46:04.697
resurfaced when he heard
she was seeing someone new,

46:04.699 --> 46:06.599
and got scared
he was gonna lose her.

46:06.601 --> 46:09.502
Of course. It's a story as old as time.
Do you know who he is?

46:09.504 --> 46:11.938
I wish I did!

46:11.940 --> 46:14.974
Do you know anybody who
knows her past boyfriends?

46:14.976 --> 46:16.609
Timmy?

46:17.644 --> 46:18.945
Put down your trombone.

46:18.947 --> 46:20.813
I need to talk to
you for a second.

46:20.815 --> 46:22.582
I've been thinking about
the scissors incident,

46:22.584 --> 46:26.419
and I realize now that it
was my fault, and I'm sorry.

46:26.421 --> 46:28.955
Abraham Lincoln
wouldn't have done that.

46:28.957 --> 46:31.657
No, probably not.
Definitely not!

46:31.659 --> 46:33.960
Or else they wouldn't have
called him "honest Abe."

46:33.962 --> 46:36.095
So let me make it up to you.

46:36.097 --> 46:38.765
How would you like to play
on the school soccer team?

46:38.767 --> 46:40.833
I tried out, but I got cut.

46:40.835 --> 46:43.403
Well, maybe I can whisper
in coach nolan's ear

46:43.405 --> 46:45.438
a little bit,
tell him you made a mistake.

46:45.440 --> 46:48.408
You can do that? I'm the principal.
I have tremendous power.

46:48.410 --> 46:50.476
But if you want me
to do a favor for you,

46:50.478 --> 46:52.545
you may have to do
a little favor for me.

46:52.547 --> 46:55.148
Mmm... you want something
from my lunchbox?

46:55.150 --> 46:57.450
No. No, that's okay.

46:57.452 --> 47:01.554
It's just that I'm sure you
go over to your aunt's house

47:01.556 --> 47:03.923
from time to time, right?
Mm-hmm.

47:03.925 --> 47:06.592
Have you ever noticed
a really large man over there?

47:06.594 --> 47:09.162
Mm-hmm.
Do you remember his name?

47:09.164 --> 47:11.864
Uh-uh. It was
a weird name.

47:11.866 --> 47:14.066
I think he was a doctor.

47:14.068 --> 47:16.035
Really? W-what
kind of doctor?

47:16.037 --> 47:17.770
I think a famous kind.

47:17.772 --> 47:19.439
What do you mean,
a famous kind?

47:19.441 --> 47:21.874
I just remember my mom
saying that he was famous.

47:21.876 --> 47:23.843
And I know he was a doctor
'cause they asked him

47:23.845 --> 47:25.611
to take a look at my rash.

47:32.186 --> 47:33.886
Maybe it's
Dr. Seuss.

47:33.888 --> 47:36.456
He's dead. What about
Dr. Jane goodall?

47:36.458 --> 47:39.158
Sorry, but that's kind of hot.
Only to you.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.127
I was just thinking
outside the box.

47:41.129 --> 47:43.863
Yeah, well,
stay within the box.

47:43.865 --> 47:46.966
Think of logical people,
like Dr. dre.

47:46.968 --> 47:49.502
Interesting. Molly's
trained in hip-hop.

47:49.504 --> 47:51.070
I know he's
an extra-large.

47:51.072 --> 47:53.005
The-the only thing that
doesn't make sense is,

47:53.007 --> 47:55.007
Timmy's mother asked the guy
to look at his rash.

47:55.009 --> 47:57.510
Would you ask Dr. dre
to look at your kid's rash?

47:57.512 --> 47:59.512
Well, I would,
but that's just me.

47:59.514 --> 48:01.647
Let's put a pin in dre.

48:01.649 --> 48:04.083
How about Dr. j?
Same rash argument.

48:04.085 --> 48:06.519
Dr. William h. Cosby, Jr.?

48:06.521 --> 48:08.688
You're not helping.

48:11.125 --> 48:13.125
Oh, no.
Oh, my God, no.

48:13.127 --> 48:14.494
No! No!

48:14.496 --> 48:15.895
What?

48:15.897 --> 48:17.497
Dr. oz!

48:18.632 --> 48:20.199
America's doctor?

48:20.201 --> 48:22.235
The kid said he had
an unusual name.

48:22.237 --> 48:24.971
What's more unusual than mehmet?
I have to be honest.

48:24.973 --> 48:28.074
If I had a choice of lovers,
I'd take Dr. oz over you.

48:28.076 --> 48:29.242
Yeah, so would I.

48:29.244 --> 48:30.877
I bet he's an animal.

48:30.879 --> 48:32.745
I've noticed he wears
his scrubs baggy,

48:32.747 --> 48:35.815
so it stands to reason he likes
his sweatshirts roomy as well.

48:35.817 --> 48:37.149
That's what I read about.

48:37.151 --> 48:39.118
He's been married 28 years.

48:39.120 --> 48:41.153
That makes sense.
He got married young.

48:41.155 --> 48:42.722
Now he's rich and famous.

48:42.724 --> 48:44.190
He's picking up women
left and right.

48:44.192 --> 48:45.858
That's the vibe
I'm getting from him.

48:45.860 --> 48:47.927
Yeah, I bet they met at
one of his book signings

48:47.929 --> 48:50.796
for one of his groundbreaking
high-fiber diet books.

48:50.798 --> 48:52.265
You know, if I were you,

48:52.267 --> 48:55.067
a-and let's be
perfectly clear, I'm not,

48:55.069 --> 48:57.270
but I would just come
straight out and ask her,

48:57.272 --> 48:59.105
"are you having an
affair with mehmet oz?"

48:59.107 --> 49:01.841
I asked her if she brought
back a souvenir for anyone,

49:01.843 --> 49:03.543
and she chose to deny it.

49:03.545 --> 49:05.578
If she wanted to acknowledge
the presence of oz,

49:05.580 --> 49:07.079
that was her opportunity.

49:07.081 --> 49:09.282
Well, just bring up his name
the next time you see her,

49:09.284 --> 49:11.784
and if she has a reaction,
you'll be able to tell

49:11.786 --> 49:13.986
if she's hiding something.

49:13.988 --> 49:15.988
Just bring up his name?

49:15.990 --> 49:18.024
Just bring up his name.

49:23.564 --> 49:24.730
Mehmet.

49:30.337 --> 49:31.704
Mehmet.

49:32.940 --> 49:34.574
What are you doing?

49:34.576 --> 49:37.076
Oh, uh, nothing.
Sorry.

49:42.082 --> 49:43.215
Mehmet.

49:44.885 --> 49:47.587
I'm sorry.
What are you saying?

49:47.589 --> 49:49.989
Mehmet?
Mehmet.

49:49.991 --> 49:51.791
Yes, as in...

49:51.793 --> 49:53.292
Uh, mehmet oz?

49:53.294 --> 49:55.928
Oh, my God.
Okay.

49:55.930 --> 49:57.229
My next question would be,

49:57.231 --> 49:58.898
why are you
bringing up mehmet oz?

50:01.034 --> 50:03.769
Because he's awesome

50:03.771 --> 50:05.605
and I'm really into him.

50:05.607 --> 50:07.907
Good.
Has he ever been in you?

50:07.909 --> 50:09.709
Excuse me?

50:09.711 --> 50:11.911
H-have you ever
been in him?

50:11.913 --> 50:14.714
Into him, a fan, so to speak?

50:14.716 --> 50:18.150
I-I read one of his books,
"this gland is your gland."

50:18.152 --> 50:20.052
Can I borrow it? You're
having hormonal issues?

50:20.054 --> 50:23.756
No. No, I just always
wanted to read it.

50:23.758 --> 50:26.258
Seriously, Charlie.

50:26.260 --> 50:28.127
What is up with you?

50:28.129 --> 50:30.029
Up with me?

50:30.031 --> 50:31.764
Yeah, I mean,

50:31.766 --> 50:33.966
we always end up on
these weird tangents

50:33.968 --> 50:36.736
like sweatshirts
or Dr. oz.

50:36.738 --> 50:39.038
I really, I don't want
to talk about Dr. oz.

50:47.981 --> 50:50.216
Oh, thirteen hour flight.

50:50.218 --> 50:52.284
Flight? Yeah, it's my brother

50:52.286 --> 50:54.320
texting me with details
about this weekend.

50:56.423 --> 50:59.258
I had a last-minute trip
to Tuscany pop up.

51:03.296 --> 51:07.366
How does a last-minute
trip to Tuscany pop up?

51:07.368 --> 51:09.335
You'd have to have your own

51:09.337 --> 51:12.338
syndicated talk show to
afford something like that.

51:12.340 --> 51:16.676
Well, my brother Harris
is pretty successful.

51:16.678 --> 51:18.244
He was gonna go, but he can't,

51:18.246 --> 51:20.880
so I'm gonna take
my grandmother instead.

51:22.015 --> 51:24.016
Oh, just you and granny

51:24.018 --> 51:26.018
under the tuscan sun?

51:26.020 --> 51:29.221
Yeah, we're staying in
this little b&b, anima Mia.

51:29.223 --> 51:30.723
It's gonna be beautiful.

51:30.725 --> 51:32.458
Lucky you.

51:32.460 --> 51:35.261
The most romantic
country in the world.

51:35.263 --> 51:37.229
Mmm. Not with
your grandmother.

51:37.231 --> 51:38.998
Exactly.

51:41.202 --> 51:43.102
Good morning.

51:43.104 --> 51:46.072
I interrupt this quiz with
a very important announcement.

51:46.074 --> 51:48.908
Each weekend
one special student

51:48.910 --> 51:52.011
will get to take home
the official school flag.

51:52.013 --> 51:54.213
And this weekend
the flag goes to...

51:55.850 --> 51:57.450
Timothy Russell Clark!

51:57.452 --> 51:59.952
Sweet!

51:59.954 --> 52:02.388
Now come with me,
young patriot.

52:04.224 --> 52:07.960
Thank you, Mr. darby.
This is a real honor!

52:07.962 --> 52:09.161
Now, I need you to
do something else.

52:09.163 --> 52:11.430
I need you to call
your grandmother.

52:13.800 --> 52:16.035
But I'm only allowed
to use it in emergencies.

52:16.037 --> 52:18.037
This is an emergency.

52:18.039 --> 52:20.139
I want you to ask her if
your Uncle Harris is rich

52:20.141 --> 52:23.008
and if she's going
away this weekend.

52:23.010 --> 52:25.411
Hi, grandma.
It's Timmy.

52:25.413 --> 52:29.982
Is Uncle Harris rich, and are
you going away this weekend?

52:29.984 --> 52:32.485
Uh-huh. Okay.
I love you, too.

52:32.487 --> 52:34.286
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
It sounded like

52:34.288 --> 52:36.388
she's not going, but your
big ear was in the way.

52:36.390 --> 52:38.157
No, that's what she said.

52:38.159 --> 52:39.492
I need more info.

52:39.494 --> 52:41.427
How would you feel
about wearing a wire?

52:41.429 --> 52:43.763
Okay.
Congratulations.

52:43.765 --> 52:46.132
You're on
the soccer team. Here.

52:49.836 --> 52:52.938
Yes, I would like tickets
to a Dr. oz taping this week.

52:55.175 --> 52:57.343
You're on hiatus?

52:57.345 --> 53:00.513
Does that mean Dr. oz
is vacationing in Europe?

53:00.515 --> 53:03.182
You're not at liberty to say,
or you're covering for

53:03.184 --> 53:05.117
an affair
he's having? Oh!

53:06.486 --> 53:08.521
Molly's sleeping
with mehmet oz.

53:08.523 --> 53:10.523
Mehmet oz?

53:10.525 --> 53:13.292
Oprah in on it too? M-maybe
they're having a three-way.

53:13.294 --> 53:15.094
Okay, calm down.
I'm fairly sure

53:15.096 --> 53:16.962
Molly's never had
sex with Oprah.

53:16.964 --> 53:18.264
Charlie, listen to me.

53:18.266 --> 53:20.933
Molly is not
sleeping with Dr. oz.

53:20.935 --> 53:23.102
You hear me?
She's not sleeping with oz.

53:23.104 --> 53:25.471
I guess that's possible.

53:25.473 --> 53:27.540
None of this is without proof.

53:27.542 --> 53:29.308
What proof do you have?

53:29.310 --> 53:32.311
If you tell me the sweatshirt,
I am going to have to kill you.

53:32.313 --> 53:36.248
Fine. But it wasn't
in the father's closet.

53:36.250 --> 53:38.884
<i>Okay, so this is
where I should have taken him</i>

53:38.886 --> 53:41.253
<i>straight to the hospital.
He clearly needs help.</i>

53:41.255 --> 53:42.588
<i>I should have been like...</i>

53:42.590 --> 53:44.089
You went in
the father's closet?

53:44.091 --> 53:45.357
<i>Or even...</i>

53:45.359 --> 53:47.459
You went in
the father's closet?!

53:47.461 --> 53:51.397
<i>Instead, I just tried to listen
and talk some sense into him.</i>

53:51.399 --> 53:53.299
You went
in the father's closet?

53:53.301 --> 53:55.067
Of course I went in
the father's closet!

53:55.069 --> 53:57.269
I'm just trying to find
out the truth, Jason.

53:57.271 --> 53:59.138
This is a great woman
we're talking about.

53:59.140 --> 54:01.340
I have a right to know
who I'm up against.

54:01.342 --> 54:05.077
Charlie, you always conjure up
some imaginary enemy,

54:05.079 --> 54:08.013
some guy you think
you can't compete with.

54:08.015 --> 54:09.615
Buckey the clown,
bas the convict,

54:09.617 --> 54:11.217
the Black Eyed Peas!

54:11.219 --> 54:12.985
The other times that
may have been true, yes,

54:12.987 --> 54:14.220
but this time is different.

54:14.222 --> 54:17.156
No! No, it's not!

54:17.158 --> 54:19.258
Like always, this is you

54:19.260 --> 54:21.293
telling yourself that you're
not good enough for her!

54:21.295 --> 54:23.229
<i>Sorry to keep interrupting,</i>

54:23.231 --> 54:25.497
<i>but for the record, I'm making
some very good points here.</i>

54:25.499 --> 54:28.100
<i>The problem is that when you're alone
and talking to a crazy person,</i>

54:28.102 --> 54:31.637
<i>it doesn't matter how good your
points are if the other guy's insane.</i>

54:31.639 --> 54:34.006
<i>And I-I'm not trying
to make excuses here.</i>

54:34.008 --> 54:36.208
<i>Believe me, I-I know
I failed my best friend</i>

54:36.210 --> 54:39.578
<i>when he needed me, and I
accept full responsibility</i>

54:39.580 --> 54:41.981
<i>for the fiasco that
is about to unfold.</i>

54:41.983 --> 54:44.016
This is you telling yourself

54:44.018 --> 54:45.885
that you're not
good enough for her!

54:45.887 --> 54:48.454
Not true. I think I'm
plenty good enough for her.

54:48.456 --> 54:51.924
S-sure, I'm not a heart surgeon
with my own brilliant TV show.

54:51.926 --> 54:53.259
You're seeing a doctor, right?

54:53.261 --> 54:54.593
Yeah,
I-I like him a lot.

54:54.595 --> 54:56.629
But going back, there's no way

54:56.631 --> 54:59.164
you can tell me that
Molly is not going away

54:59.166 --> 55:01.634
with another man, especially

55:01.636 --> 55:04.003
when her grandmother
specifically said

55:04.005 --> 55:05.604
she was not going out of town.

55:05.606 --> 55:07.406
How do you know that?
Timmy.

55:07.408 --> 55:10.676
Timmy? Your informant
is nine, Charlie!

55:10.678 --> 55:14.346
He called her and I listened in.
Why would she lie to the kid?

55:16.316 --> 55:18.417
Well, I-I guess
it's possible

55:18.419 --> 55:20.519
that Molly could be
going with another guy.

55:20.521 --> 55:22.154
But even if that is the case,

55:22.156 --> 55:24.089
there really isn't much
you can do about it.

55:24.091 --> 55:25.524
Yeah, there is.

55:25.526 --> 55:28.260
I can text her
and confront her about oz.

55:28.262 --> 55:29.461
N-no! No!

55:29.463 --> 55:30.996
No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:30.998 --> 55:32.998
I can't be without
my phone right now.

55:33.000 --> 55:35.167
Oh, and you're staying
with me this weekend.

55:35.169 --> 55:37.303
You're not gonna go
and do something stupid

55:37.305 --> 55:39.271
like the last time.

55:39.273 --> 55:41.073
I'll be back in a few.

55:42.375 --> 55:43.709
Keep your shit together.

55:43.711 --> 55:46.211
It's together!
Stop worrying.

55:46.213 --> 55:48.080
I am totally in control.

55:55.088 --> 55:57.523
Hello? Baby bird,
it's red rooster.

55:57.525 --> 55:59.391
Huh?
It's principal darby.

55:59.393 --> 56:01.460
I'm using a code name
in case anyone's near you.

56:01.462 --> 56:03.329
What do you have for me?

56:06.132 --> 56:08.334
I heard there was
gonna be a proposal.

56:11.571 --> 56:13.272
A proposal?

56:14.708 --> 56:16.575
What are your sources,
baby bird?

56:16.577 --> 56:18.978
I wrote down what mommy
and aunt Molly said.

56:18.980 --> 56:21.046
A-are you sure you
wrote "proposal"?

56:21.048 --> 56:23.449
No offense, but you're not
the world's best speller.

56:23.451 --> 56:25.284
No, that's what I wrote.

56:25.286 --> 56:26.752
Are you-are you
positive?

56:26.754 --> 56:28.554
I'm positive.

56:31.558 --> 56:32.725
Hello?

57:23.777 --> 57:25.277
Wha... oh.

57:25.279 --> 57:27.146
Uh, ciao.
Ciao.

57:27.148 --> 57:29.181
Have you seen this man?

57:30.817 --> 57:32.551
Dottore oz.

57:32.553 --> 57:34.353
Il dottore d'America.

57:34.355 --> 57:36.055
Oh, my God, you have seen him.

57:36.057 --> 57:38.190
Uh, did you notice if
he was holding a ring?

57:38.192 --> 57:40.659
A-a-a... what
room is he in?

57:40.661 --> 57:42.461
No.
Look, uh,

57:42.463 --> 57:45.597
he was with another
guest, Molly Kingston.

57:45.599 --> 57:48.267
Ah, si, signorina
Molly Kingston.

57:48.269 --> 57:50.069
Yeah, d-do you
know where she is?

57:50.071 --> 57:52.771
Solo andate a vigneto.

57:52.773 --> 57:54.206
Wha... wha...

57:54.208 --> 57:56.708
Wha...
Vigneto.

57:56.710 --> 57:58.811
Oh, th-the vineyard?
They went to the vineyard?

57:58.813 --> 58:01.413
Si. Romantico.

58:02.449 --> 58:04.683
Oh... ciao!

58:04.685 --> 58:06.518
Ah.

58:24.337 --> 58:25.671
No!

58:54.434 --> 58:55.767
Charlie?

58:55.769 --> 58:57.202
Molly?

58:57.204 --> 59:00.339
Oh, wow, wow, what, what a...

59:00.341 --> 59:02.741
What a small world.
W-what are you doing here?

59:02.743 --> 59:04.676
What are you doing here?

59:04.678 --> 59:07.179
Oh, my God, Charlie.

59:07.181 --> 59:09.181
Are you crazy?
Yes, Molly.

59:09.183 --> 59:11.550
Yes, I am. Surprising
me like this?

59:11.552 --> 59:13.552
You know, I am speechless.

59:13.554 --> 59:16.355
I can't believe you came
all this way to surprise me.

59:19.392 --> 59:20.659
Surprise!

59:24.531 --> 59:26.331
Oh, my God, I am touched.

59:26.333 --> 59:28.367
Genuinely touched.

59:28.369 --> 59:29.868
Well...

59:29.870 --> 59:31.837
Surprise, grandma!

59:31.839 --> 59:33.705
Surprise!

59:33.707 --> 59:38.377
Nana, this is the guy that
I was telling you about.

59:40.214 --> 59:42.548
Hi. Uh,
nice to meet you.

59:42.550 --> 59:46.285
Nice to meet you,
and thanks for all that melon.

59:46.287 --> 59:47.886
Oh.

59:47.888 --> 59:50.656
I'm Charlie.
I'm Molly's boyfriend.

59:50.658 --> 59:52.558
Antonio, bebe's nurse.

59:52.560 --> 59:55.460
I left Charlie a message saying

59:55.462 --> 59:57.462
it was so beautiful in Italy

59:57.464 --> 59:59.598
and that I wished he was here.

59:59.600 --> 01:00:02.434
And here he is.
Can you believe it?

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:04.703
It's wonderful.

01:00:04.705 --> 01:00:08.707
I guess I sensed something
in your voice in the message.

01:00:09.876 --> 01:00:11.743
I was hinting a little.

01:00:11.745 --> 01:00:13.579
Yes, you were.

01:00:13.581 --> 01:00:15.647
And I can pick up a hint
with the best of 'em.

01:00:17.283 --> 01:00:18.817
You know, it's been
such a long day.

01:00:18.819 --> 01:00:20.552
Why don't you take
the rest of it off.

01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:22.221
Yeah, take tomorrow off, too.

01:00:25.326 --> 01:00:27.392
Ciao.
Thank you.

01:00:28.962 --> 01:00:30.329
Yikes.

01:00:30.331 --> 01:00:33.899
So, Nana wants

01:00:33.901 --> 01:00:37.536
to recreate the moment where
my gramps proposed to her.

01:00:37.538 --> 01:00:40.906
It was 70 years ago today,
right here in this vineyard.

01:00:43.277 --> 01:00:46.745
I would like Charlie
to play my Harold.

01:00:47.847 --> 01:00:49.781
Oh.

01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:51.883
I would be honored
to play Harold.

01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:53.518
Thank you.

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.753
Wow.

01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:56.822
This is really coming together.

01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:00.525
I just, I wish
that we could get

01:01:00.527 --> 01:01:02.995
to the exact spot where
my gramps proposed to her,

01:01:02.997 --> 01:01:05.797
but we can't get Nana's
wheelchair up there, so...

01:01:05.799 --> 01:01:07.633
Oh. Where
is the spot?

01:01:07.635 --> 01:01:09.334
It's on top of that hill.

01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:20.279
Molly, get the chair.

01:01:21.281 --> 01:01:22.447
Charlie.

01:02:02.488 --> 01:02:05.991
Well, here we are,
back at our hotel,

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:08.827
my blushing bride bebe.
Thanks, Charlie.

01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:10.996
I think we can stop
with the recreation now.

01:02:10.998 --> 01:02:12.464
Sure thing.

01:02:12.466 --> 01:02:15.500
Ah, buonasera.
Uh...

01:02:15.502 --> 01:02:17.903
Ah, signora, buonasera.

01:02:17.905 --> 01:02:19.938
Come stai, signora? Bene.

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:22.074
Grazie e bene.

01:02:22.076 --> 01:02:23.942
Thanks for coming.
Oh...

01:02:23.944 --> 01:02:25.811
You know, I have to admit,

01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:27.946
you've been acting
pretty strange lately

01:02:27.948 --> 01:02:29.848
and I wasn't sure about us.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.817
The fact that you
came all this way?

01:02:32.885 --> 01:02:34.586
I don't know what to say.

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:36.955
Oh, please.
It was nothing.

01:02:36.957 --> 01:02:40.025
I loved meeting Nana.
I love everyone in your family.

01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:43.095
Mmm... oh, uh,
speaking of family.

01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:45.497
My sister asked me
to ask you not

01:02:45.499 --> 01:02:47.733
to mention Nana's illness
in front of Timmy.

01:02:47.735 --> 01:02:50.135
She's trying
to shield him from that.

01:02:50.137 --> 01:02:53.572
Of course she is.
I mean... Yeah.

01:02:53.574 --> 01:02:56.041
He's in this
weird phase lately.

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.810
First he acted up
in art class, hmm.

01:02:58.812 --> 01:03:00.579
And then yesterday
he called my mom,

01:03:00.581 --> 01:03:02.647
he asked her if she
was going out of town

01:03:02.649 --> 01:03:04.783
and-and if
my brother's rich.

01:03:04.785 --> 01:03:06.685
Your mom is his grandmother.

01:03:06.687 --> 01:03:08.954
Your grandmother's
his great-grandmother.

01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:10.822
Very good.
Thank you.

01:03:10.824 --> 01:03:14.726
I'd better run.
This is so frustrating.

01:03:14.728 --> 01:03:16.661
We're in this
totally romantic place

01:03:16.663 --> 01:03:18.663
and I can't do anything about it.
Oh.

01:03:18.665 --> 01:03:21.466
I have this Lacey
lingerie with me, but,

01:03:21.468 --> 01:03:23.535
you know, I just, I have
to stay with my gram.

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:25.470
Hey, look,
I knew you were gonna

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:28.039
be with her
when I decided to come.

01:03:28.041 --> 01:03:30.008
It's okay.
Oh.

01:03:31.944 --> 01:03:33.779
Nana!

01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:34.946
I'm back.

01:03:46.826 --> 01:03:49.628
<i>I have this
Lacey lingerie with me.</i>

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.463
<i>A last-minute
trip to Tuscany.</i>

01:03:51.465 --> 01:03:52.964
<i>I guess it's possible</i>

01:03:52.966 --> 01:03:54.633
<i>that Molly could be
going with another guy.</i>

01:03:54.635 --> 01:03:56.168
<i>I think he was a doctor.</i>

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.003
<i>Antonio, bebe's nurse.</i>

01:03:58.005 --> 01:04:00.505
<i>I bet he's an animal.</i>

01:04:07.481 --> 01:04:08.880
Hello?

01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:12.050
Bebe? It's Charlie.
Can I talk to Molly?

01:04:12.052 --> 01:04:13.919
She went out for some air.

01:04:13.921 --> 01:04:15.787
Bullshit.
What?

01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:17.823
Uh, nothing.
Can you let me in?

01:04:19.059 --> 01:04:20.926
Charlie?

01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:25.697
Charlie.

01:04:25.699 --> 01:04:27.966
Come on, Nana.
Chop-chop!

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:34.172
Thanks. I didn't want to
leave you all alone, beebs.

01:04:34.174 --> 01:04:36.608
It's okay.

01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:39.711
Molly said she'd be
back in a few minutes.

01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:42.147
Oh, that's great.

01:04:42.149 --> 01:04:45.617
Did she mention anything
about nurse Antonio?

01:04:45.619 --> 01:04:47.018
Hmm. Oh, yes,

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:50.222
this morning she said
he was a good nurse.

01:04:50.224 --> 01:04:52.491
Oh. Did she say anything
to the effect of

01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:54.726
Italian men make
the best lovers?

01:04:54.728 --> 01:04:57.963
Hmm... not
that I recall.

01:04:57.965 --> 01:04:59.998
But I agree with that.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.835
Why don't you, uh,
take a look at the view?

01:05:03.837 --> 01:05:05.871
I don't see anything.

01:05:05.873 --> 01:05:07.072
It's too dark.

01:05:17.049 --> 01:05:19.885
Ooh, I think I see a cat.

01:05:25.124 --> 01:05:26.758
I'm thirsty.

01:05:28.261 --> 01:05:30.262
Suck it up, Nana.

01:05:30.264 --> 01:05:32.264
"Suck it up, Nana"?

01:05:32.266 --> 01:05:34.232
Charlie, what are you doing?

01:05:34.234 --> 01:05:37.569
I'm, uh, playing
"suck it up, Nana."

01:05:37.571 --> 01:05:39.204
Haven't you ever
heard of that game?

01:05:39.206 --> 01:05:40.772
Very big in my family.

01:05:40.774 --> 01:05:42.707
You okay?
What happened?

01:05:42.709 --> 01:05:44.543
Charlie put me in the corner.

01:05:44.545 --> 01:05:47.279
She was disruptive,
I gave her a time-out.

01:05:47.281 --> 01:05:48.947
I don't, um, understand.

01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:50.882
Why are you going
through my stuff?

01:05:50.884 --> 01:05:53.285
Because...

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:56.588
Nana was cold. I'm just
trying to find her a wrap.

01:05:56.590 --> 01:05:58.790
I never said I was cold.

01:05:58.792 --> 01:06:01.693
You never said,
"I'm oh so cold.

01:06:01.695 --> 01:06:04.996
Can you hook me up with a
wrap, sweet Charlie boy"? No!

01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:07.799
Oh-oh, lord, I think
senility has set in.

01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:10.302
I think she can remember
what happened five minutes ago!

01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:12.604
She remembered every word
of my grandfather's proposal,

01:06:12.606 --> 01:06:14.039
which was 70 years ago.

01:06:14.041 --> 01:06:15.974
Yeah, but she could've
made that stuff up.

01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:18.777
You don't know. You weren't there.
Charlie, enough!

01:06:18.779 --> 01:06:21.012
We need to talk.
Outside.

01:06:25.051 --> 01:06:26.885
I'm starting to lose patience,

01:06:26.887 --> 01:06:28.653
so tell me the truth.

01:06:28.655 --> 01:06:30.855
What is going on here?

01:06:30.857 --> 01:06:33.158
Okay, fine.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.894
I don't understand why
I'm the one on trial here.

01:06:35.896 --> 01:06:39.164
Do you expect me to believe you
actually went out for some air?

01:06:39.166 --> 01:06:41.611
Of course I didn't. I
lied to my grandmother.

01:06:41.637 --> 01:06:42.834
That's what I thought.

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.036
So why are you treating me
like I'm the guilty one?

01:06:45.038 --> 01:06:46.938
Especially when you
brought lingerie with you

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.640
when you had no idea
I was even coming.

01:06:48.642 --> 01:06:50.075
I bought it this morning.

01:06:50.077 --> 01:06:51.910
I was bringing it home
to wear for you.

01:06:51.912 --> 01:06:54.212
Really? Well, then why
isn't it in your suitcase?

01:06:54.214 --> 01:06:57.215
Because I just wore it
up to your room.

01:07:01.787 --> 01:07:03.088
Oh.

01:07:07.293 --> 01:07:08.627
My bad.

01:07:11.731 --> 01:07:13.331
Please leave.

01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:15.634
Honey, you sure you don't want
to just forget about all this

01:07:15.636 --> 01:07:17.168
and get ready for
Florence tomorrow?

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.037
I'll push the chair.

01:07:20.106 --> 01:07:22.040
Wait. Wait.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:27.646
Okay, look. There's something
you need to know about me.

01:07:27.648 --> 01:07:31.016
I've been afraid
to tell you this...

01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:34.352
But I'm...

01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:36.821
Insane.

01:07:36.823 --> 01:07:38.056
You think?

01:07:38.058 --> 01:07:39.791
Not all the time.

01:07:39.793 --> 01:07:42.327
Just when I fall in love.

01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:45.163
It's a real psychological condition.
I'm psychotic.

01:07:45.165 --> 01:07:47.132
Y-you're really
helping your case here?

01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:49.100
But I can beat it.

01:07:49.102 --> 01:07:50.835
Yeah, I can tell.

01:07:53.239 --> 01:07:55.874
You know, when I saw you
standing in the vineyard,

01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:59.744
at first I thought,
"did he follow me here?"

01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:02.681
But I thought,
"who would be crazy enough

01:08:02.683 --> 01:08:05.216
to come all the way to Italy
just to check up on me?"

01:08:06.886 --> 01:08:09.387
No, it wasn't just
to check up on you.

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:11.690
Charlie,
th-this is over.

01:08:14.827 --> 01:08:17.328
Please just respect that.

01:08:17.330 --> 01:08:20.064
Oh, I think you're
being impulsive here.

01:08:20.067 --> 01:08:22.801
Okay, bebe, tell her she's
being impulsive and to...

01:08:24.371 --> 01:08:26.203
Give me another chance.

01:08:42.455 --> 01:08:45.156
Greetings from Thailand.

01:08:45.158 --> 01:08:47.325
Off the port bow

01:08:47.327 --> 01:08:50.862
you'll see the gorgeous
island of ko samui.

01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:54.999
Its scenic beaches have made it
a popular honeymoon destination.

01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:01.473
Your principal
back in San Pedro

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:03.975
very much wanted
to visit it someday.

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:06.845
But that's okay.

01:09:08.147 --> 01:09:10.482
<i>The good ship
Lincoln elementary</i>

01:09:10.484 --> 01:09:12.015
sails on...

01:09:13.051 --> 01:09:15.886
Into the vast,

01:09:15.889 --> 01:09:17.020
dark...

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:21.792
Cold emptiness.

01:09:21.795 --> 01:09:23.828
And that's how I soothe
my constipation.

01:09:23.830 --> 01:09:26.296
Polenta.
Fascinating.

01:09:26.299 --> 01:09:29.466
Oh, you know what?
I'll be right back.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:32.837
First I couldn't shit,
now I can't stop shitting.

01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.372
Life, huh?

01:09:38.077 --> 01:09:39.944
Charlie, you
can't live like this.

01:09:39.946 --> 01:09:42.913
She's nasty, vile,
bowl-obsessed.

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:45.517
What are my choices? Huh?

01:09:45.519 --> 01:09:48.086
I can't fall in love.
That doesn't work.

01:09:48.087 --> 01:09:50.921
So it's either be alone
or be with people

01:09:50.924 --> 01:09:52.890
that I feel absolutely
nothing for.

01:09:52.893 --> 01:09:55.493
I'd rather be alone
than be with her.

01:09:55.495 --> 01:09:57.495
I'd rather be on fire.

01:09:57.497 --> 01:09:58.830
I...

01:10:00.132 --> 01:10:02.000
I-I talked to Michelle. Oh, no.

01:10:02.002 --> 01:10:03.935
No, don't worry.
It's fine.

01:10:03.937 --> 01:10:05.570
I asked her if there
was anything she thought

01:10:05.572 --> 01:10:07.806
you could do, and she said
that none of your ex's

01:10:07.808 --> 01:10:09.874
that she interviewed
were sympathetic until

01:10:09.876 --> 01:10:12.443
they fully understood the
magnitude of your problem.

01:10:12.445 --> 01:10:14.946
So maybe if Molly,

01:10:14.948 --> 01:10:17.415
you know, had
a sense of what...

01:10:17.417 --> 01:10:19.317
Please don't bring up Molly.

01:10:19.319 --> 01:10:22.854
I can't relive
what I've been through.

01:10:22.856 --> 01:10:24.889
My life may not be
perfect right now,

01:10:24.891 --> 01:10:27.926
or actually really,
really far from perfect,

01:10:27.928 --> 01:10:31.196
but I'd rather be numb
than be hurting.

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:35.066
False alarm.

01:10:35.068 --> 01:10:37.235
Nothing but air.

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:53.318
<i>Woman moaning)</i>

01:10:59.158 --> 01:11:01.593
I took 40 bucks
from your dresser.

01:11:04.164 --> 01:11:07.131
Oh. Oh, yeah.

01:11:09.602 --> 01:11:12.103
Anyone want more cereal?

01:11:12.105 --> 01:11:13.638
Yo.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.940
Whew!

01:11:15.942 --> 01:11:19.410
Oh, that lieutenant Dan
is some kind of lover.

01:11:19.412 --> 01:11:20.912
Cap'n crunch?

01:11:20.914 --> 01:11:22.614
Hit on me again,
and I'll snap off

01:11:22.616 --> 01:11:24.916
your cock and use it
to stir my drink.

01:11:26.418 --> 01:11:30.154
If you're trying to turn me on,
mission accomplished.

01:11:30.156 --> 01:11:32.891
I have half a mind
to clean your pipes.

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:41.432
Oh.

01:12:03.289 --> 01:12:06.991
Michelle, it's Charlie.

01:12:06.993 --> 01:12:08.159
Listen.

01:12:09.328 --> 01:12:10.929
I need your help.

01:12:14.433 --> 01:12:17.001
My God.
Is that Charlie?

01:12:17.003 --> 01:12:19.704
Yes. His friend
asked me to bring you here,

01:12:19.706 --> 01:12:22.240
said there was
something you needed to hear.

01:12:22.242 --> 01:12:26.244
Hi.
I know this is weird,

01:12:26.246 --> 01:12:28.613
but this will all be
very clear in a few minutes.

01:12:28.615 --> 01:12:31.049
We couldn't fully
explain what happened

01:12:31.051 --> 01:12:33.418
without, uh, a little
help from some friends.

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:37.588
Thank you.

01:12:43.462 --> 01:12:44.595
Molly.

01:12:45.698 --> 01:12:49.000
Th-these are my...

01:12:49.002 --> 01:12:50.969
Ex-girlfriends.

01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.611
This is the most uncomfortable
moment of my life.

01:13:00.613 --> 01:13:02.680
And another time,
I took my little sister

01:13:02.682 --> 01:13:05.516
camping for the weekend,
and Charlie insisted

01:13:05.518 --> 01:13:07.652
that I was off having
a conjugal visit.

01:13:07.654 --> 01:13:10.588
I saw on "60 minutes"
that there's a website

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:13.291
where women met convicts.

01:13:13.293 --> 01:13:16.127
Thinking you were one of those
women was where I went wrong.

01:13:16.129 --> 01:13:18.196
It's okay.
I forgive you

01:13:18.198 --> 01:13:21.499
for thinking
I was a prison whore.

01:13:21.501 --> 01:13:25.703
Tanya. You're the only one
we haven't heard from.

01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:28.239
So much shit.
Where do I begin?

01:13:28.241 --> 01:13:31.075
Well, one day I had some
blue splotches on my jeans

01:13:31.077 --> 01:13:33.478
that I got from my niece's
birthday at color me mine,

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.646
and Charlie thought
I was having an affair

01:13:35.648 --> 01:13:37.582
with the blue man group.

01:13:39.386 --> 01:13:42.120
There were six blue
dots on her pants,

01:13:42.122 --> 01:13:44.589
the exact number of
combined testicles

01:13:44.591 --> 01:13:46.224
of the entire group.

01:13:49.128 --> 01:13:51.529
Okay, you know, it's,
uh, it's getting late.

01:13:51.531 --> 01:13:54.132
Uh, maybe it's time

01:13:54.134 --> 01:13:56.701
for us to go home.

01:13:56.703 --> 01:13:59.737
Th-this was incredibly
kind of all of you.

01:13:59.739 --> 01:14:02.440
Again, a million apologies.

01:14:06.612 --> 01:14:07.779
Good luck.

01:14:07.781 --> 01:14:10.214
Thanks.
Thank you.

01:14:12.384 --> 01:14:14.085
Good night.

01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:19.824
Wow. That was, uh,

01:14:19.826 --> 01:14:22.560
that was eye-opening,
to say the least.

01:14:24.164 --> 01:14:26.164
I totally get it now.

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:28.499
And it all made
sense at the time,

01:14:28.501 --> 01:14:30.101
just like Dr. oz.

01:14:30.103 --> 01:14:32.637
Where did you even
come up with that?

01:14:32.639 --> 01:14:35.673
Your nephew said you
dated a famous doctor.

01:14:35.675 --> 01:14:38.276
I dated a Finnish
doctor, nels jarvey.

01:14:38.278 --> 01:14:39.844
He's a podiatrist.

01:14:39.846 --> 01:14:42.413
So, I was close.

01:14:45.451 --> 01:14:48.386
It was-it was really
nice seeing you.

01:14:48.388 --> 01:14:50.655
Y-you know I wish you
only the best.

01:14:52.758 --> 01:14:54.559
Oh, but w-wait.

01:14:54.561 --> 01:14:57.361
I-I thought you
understood all this.

01:14:57.363 --> 01:14:59.831
I do, an-and, you know,

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.634
I can't imagine how hard
all of this has been for you.

01:15:05.437 --> 01:15:07.438
But your condition's
like a real thing.

01:15:09.608 --> 01:15:13.544
Sorry, I must...
Sound like an awful person.

01:15:13.546 --> 01:15:15.413
Molly, please don't...

01:15:15.415 --> 01:15:16.781
Apologize.

01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:19.717
It was my fault.

01:15:19.719 --> 01:15:23.121
Of course it wasn't.
You couldn't help it.

01:15:25.157 --> 01:15:26.324
Goodbye.

01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:34.165
Hang in there, mate.

01:15:48.147 --> 01:15:49.780
So, how's Charlie?

01:15:49.782 --> 01:15:52.517
Nana, you know Charlie
and I aren't together anymore.

01:15:52.519 --> 01:15:55.553
Well, I thought you
saw him at dinner.

01:15:55.555 --> 01:15:57.555
I did, but...

01:15:57.557 --> 01:16:00.491
That was just...
it was a one-time thing.

01:16:00.493 --> 01:16:02.260
I like him.

01:16:02.262 --> 01:16:03.794
You do?

01:16:03.796 --> 01:16:07.598
We were married briefly,
you know.

01:16:10.702 --> 01:16:15.573
Nana, you should know,
Charlie followed us to Italy.

01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:18.309
Yeah, I knew it
the first moment I saw him.

01:16:18.311 --> 01:16:20.845
And it didn't bother you?

01:16:20.847 --> 01:16:22.847
Not really.

01:16:22.849 --> 01:16:26.551
You should've seen some of
the stuff I did when pop-pop

01:16:26.553 --> 01:16:28.352
and I were courting.

01:16:28.354 --> 01:16:31.255
I accused him of
having an affair

01:16:31.257 --> 01:16:33.357
with one of the other riveters.

01:16:33.359 --> 01:16:34.926
And what did
pop-pop do?

01:16:34.928 --> 01:16:37.228
What do you think he did?

01:16:37.230 --> 01:16:39.397
You're sitting here
now, aren't you?

01:17:00.385 --> 01:17:03.487
Good morning.
Welcome to the spring concert.

01:17:03.489 --> 01:17:05.323
First, before we get started,

01:17:05.325 --> 01:17:07.925
let me introduce our
band teacher, Mr. thorpe.

01:17:12.564 --> 01:17:14.699
Hello, Lincoln elementary.

01:17:14.701 --> 01:17:16.701
Welcome to the spring concert.

01:17:16.703 --> 01:17:18.903
I am your band director.

01:17:24.943 --> 01:17:26.911
Are you okay?

01:17:26.913 --> 01:17:28.246
Yeah.

01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:32.416
Do you still want me
to wear that wire?

01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:34.719
No. Thank you, Timmy.

01:17:34.721 --> 01:17:37.255
That's all right.
Have a good show.

01:17:46.999 --> 01:17:49.000
Molly.

01:17:49.002 --> 01:17:50.368
Hey.

01:17:52.571 --> 01:17:54.538
It's...
Good to see you.

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.376
Uh, Timmy will be
really happy you came.

01:17:58.378 --> 01:18:00.311
I didn't come to see Timmy.

01:18:02.014 --> 01:18:03.814
Who did you come to see?

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:08.419
Please say me.

01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:12.356
Look, you know,
I-I was thinking.

01:18:12.358 --> 01:18:16.360
If criminals can plead insanity,
then why shouldn't you?

01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:19.864
A-all you did was...

01:18:19.866 --> 01:18:22.967
Fall in love with you.

01:18:22.969 --> 01:18:25.069
Right.

01:18:25.071 --> 01:18:28.873
I want to kiss you so badly right now.
So, what's the problem?

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:32.443
School has so many rules about
public displays of affection.

01:18:32.445 --> 01:18:35.713
I... ah, screw it.
I'll give myself detention.

01:19:23.061 --> 01:19:24.829
<i>Remember her?</i>

01:19:24.831 --> 01:19:27.131
<i>She saw one stray, shiny rock</i>

01:19:27.133 --> 01:19:30.468
<i>and thought her boyfriend zog
was getting it on with uba.</i>

01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:33.938
<i>Well, it got a lot worse
before it got better.</i>

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:37.675
<i>Until, luckily,
she found the help she needed.</i>

01:19:37.677 --> 01:19:39.110
<i>But more important,</i>

01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:41.712
<i>her relationship with
zog turned a corner.</i>

01:19:41.714 --> 01:19:43.814
<i>And as she developed
a deeper bond with him,</i>

01:19:43.816 --> 01:19:46.417
<i>she started going back
to her old self.</i>

01:19:46.419 --> 01:19:48.853
<i>And everything worked out
for her and zog</i>

01:19:48.855 --> 01:19:51.489
<i>and their thousands
of descendants.</i>

01:19:51.491 --> 01:19:54.692
<i>Same thing with Charlie.
He got some help too.</i>

01:19:54.694 --> 01:19:56.694
<i>She explained that
for someone like him,</i>

01:19:56.696 --> 01:19:59.830
<i>the first stages of love
can feel like this,</i>

01:19:59.832 --> 01:20:02.133
<i>which is really no way to live.</i>

01:20:02.135 --> 01:20:06.604
<i>But she also said that as Molly and
Charlie's relationship evolves over time,</i>

01:20:06.606 --> 01:20:08.572
<i>Charlie's symptoms
should diminish</i>

01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:12.109
<i>so that love will start
to feel more like this.</i>

01:20:12.111 --> 01:20:16.514
<i>Quiet, warm, steady
and beautiful.</i>

01:20:16.516 --> 01:20:18.649
<i>And the best part is,
they'll never get bored</i>

01:20:18.651 --> 01:20:21.952
<i>because Charlie's condition
will never completely go away.</i>

01:20:21.954 --> 01:20:24.522
<i>He'll always be
just crazy enough</i>

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:26.991
<i>to keep things interesting.</i>
