01:30.391 --> 01:31.870
Damn Americans!

02:27.582 --> 02:30.188
- Hi! Come on in.
- Hi!

02:30.284 --> 02:33.561
- God, it's been ages!
- Definitely.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.656
Hi!

02:35.756 --> 02:37.667
- How have you been?
- Great.

02:37.758 --> 02:38.964
Really?

02:39.060 --> 02:40.937
Yeah, fantastic.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.080
BREAKUPS

06:46.640 --> 06:50.281
- Well, sweet dreams.
- You too.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.978
Number 76?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.623
77?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.387
Hi, Bengt.
How are you feeling today?

08:40.754 --> 08:42.927
Thanks for recommending it.
I loved it.

08:43.691 --> 08:48.731
It's nice when two people who are
meant to be together end up together.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.274
Well...

08:50.364 --> 08:54.369
Any other movies
you'd like to recommend?

08:54.468 --> 08:56.106
Well...

08:56.203 --> 08:58.945
Maybe with a love theme...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.144
Nah.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.554
No, I actually didn't.

09:10.651 --> 09:13.564
Didn't what?

09:13.654 --> 09:15.759
Say what he said I said.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.665
Oh, I see.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.704
Well, I guess I'll be off, then.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.228
I'm just saying
that if you're invited to a party,

12:02.322 --> 12:05.531
dressing up a bit wouldn't hurt.

12:05.626 --> 12:07.572
We're just going to Bengt's.

12:07.661 --> 12:11.473
Okay, then for my sake.
I think it'd be nice.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.808
I don't feel like myself
when I dress up, you know that.

12:14.902 --> 12:20.818
Would it be so bad for us
to try something different for once?

12:38.025 --> 12:41.097
Hey! You're going the wrong way.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.765
You can go this way, too.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.469
Sure, but this is
the best way to Bengt's.

12:45.566 --> 12:47.011
We always go this way.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.138
- That path is overgrown.
- Can't we try something new?

12:50.237 --> 12:53.377
Can't we take a risk
and live a little, Birger?

12:53.473 --> 12:55.783
- Come on!
- This way takes 7 minutes.

12:55.876 --> 12:59.050
That way takes 11.
What's wrong with the usual path?

12:59.146 --> 13:02.355
There's nothing wrong with it!
It's just boring.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.896
Maybe we'll see new things
and smell something new.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.523
Maybe we'll get
to experience something.

13:08.622 --> 13:10.932
We might even have some fun!

13:12.926 --> 13:14.872
Fun?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.704
That way is 4 minutes longer.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.334
I've timed it.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.974
Hi, Bengt.

13:59.439 --> 14:02.010
I brought you a little something.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.864
I just love that movie.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.448
You sure know your movie lines.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.216
- What's up?
- Come here. We need to talk.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.255
What do you want to talk about?

16:22.349 --> 16:26.229
I've talked to Bruce.
He made me realize something.

16:30.524 --> 16:32.060
No, leave us alone, Bruce!

16:35.295 --> 16:38.572
Right!
From yet another movie.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.406
Who are you, Bengt?

16:40.500 --> 16:43.174
I'm curious to find out
what makes you tick.

16:44.971 --> 16:48.441
Don't you get it? He's right!
You just...

16:48.542 --> 16:50.715
What the...

16:57.384 --> 16:59.660
Honey?

16:59.753 --> 17:02.324
Bengt, could you stop
quoting movies?

17:03.757 --> 17:06.431
Birger? Which one is that?
I haven't seen that movie.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.530
What's going on?
Call 911!

17:09.629 --> 17:10.903
That's what I'm doing!

17:10.997 --> 17:12.135
Dad, are you alright?

17:13.633 --> 17:15.840
What's happening?

17:17.137 --> 17:19.617
Here, Dad.
Lift your head up.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.585
Everything's going to be okay.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.094
Dad, everything will be okay.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.365
Mom doesn't know what she's doing.

18:14.461 --> 18:18.534
I know exactly what I'm doing.
I've made up my mind.

18:18.632 --> 18:22.079
You know what Birger's like,
always lots of drama.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.772
I'll be right back.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.416
I've only got one life to live.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.488
Why can't I have some fun?
