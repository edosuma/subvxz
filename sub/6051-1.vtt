32:15.430 --> 32:17.390
- It's poison.
- What?

32:17.510 --> 32:21.350
It's poison. That's why it hurts so bad
cos he barely touched it.

Oh, that'll wake you up in the morning.

33:01.990 --> 33:03.910
Good news, guys.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.630
MITCH:
Hey. Hey. Jonah, what are you doing?

33:35.110 --> 33:36.310
Babe!

33:36.430 --> 33:38.110

You need to get on that table.

(HE MOANS)

34:40.830 --> 34:42.830
We all told you not to do it,

34:42.949 --> 34:44.750
but now you're over there and you're
gonna make the most of it, okay?

34:44.870 --> 34:46.350
So get on that table.

You've done a good job so far,
but your job is not done.

You first, okay?

37:58.950 --> 38:01.670
God, this is what it does!

38:01.790 --> 38:05.230
It just sits and it waits for food
to wander onto it.

38:05.350 --> 38:07.830
Why would it leave
anything for us to stand on?

38:09.710 --> 38:11.390
Look.

38:13.550 --> 38:16.910
That's the edge of it. All we have
to do is get there and we're free.

38:24.310 --> 38:26.750
What? What is it?

38:26.870 --> 38:28.750
The tyres.

It's growing up the tyres.

Oh!

We've got to do something.
We can't just sit here and wait it out.

We're next.

What are we gonna do?

38:44.470 --> 38:48.750
You see? You see that?
We might as well be miles away.

38:48.870 --> 38:51.710
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
There's got to be some...

38:51.830 --> 38:54.110
- Some what?
- The phones!

38:54.230 --> 38:56.910
- The phones. Where'd you put the phones?
- They're in the trunk.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.110
- Chanda.
- What?

39:09.230 --> 39:11.670
There isn't a release.
You have to use the keys.

39:11.790 --> 39:13.710
What are you doing?

39:13.830 --> 39:17.510
In my mom's car, you can pull
the back seats down and get to the trunk.

39:20.870 --> 39:23.030
Does the back seat come down?

39:23.150 --> 39:25.510
I never did that with Jonah.

39:31.310 --> 39:34.230
- I think I can stand on the bumper.
- Ronnie, no! You'll fall.

39:34.350 --> 39:36.670
No, I won't. I got this. Give me the key.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.670
Ah! It's hot.

39:55.870 --> 39:59.430

Chanda.

In my notebook, I wrote a letter.

40:10.590 --> 40:14.030
It's for my mom.
It's just some stuff that I needed to say.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.470
- If I don't make it, then I need...
- Stop it!

40:16.590 --> 40:18.670

Don't move.

I got it.

42:08.830 --> 42:10.910
It's hitting my shin.

- Uh!

42:19.390 --> 42:20.390
Okay.

42:21.470 --> 42:23.270
- She can't do it.
- What?

42:23.390 --> 42:24.870
She's not gonna be able to do it.

42:24.990 --> 42:26.990
No, I don't understand. It was open.

42:27.110 --> 42:29.390
It's because the trunk, it swings
really wide when you open it.

42:29.510 --> 42:30.950
She's not gonna have
anywhere to put her feet.

42:31.070 --> 42:32.790
- Can't you lean back?
- Lean back?

42:32.910 --> 42:35.510
There is nothing to hold on to.
I'm gonna fucking fall.

Okay. No, no, no! Here. Here.

47:53.710 --> 47:56.390
You look like a fucking art exhibit.

47:56.510 --> 47:57.790
What?

47:57.910 --> 48:02.830
This is embarrassing. I'm telling you, I've
been on the Beach Patrol 23 years of my life.

48:02.950 --> 48:07.590
This is fucking way worse than
the lady with a horseshoe crab up her ass.

48:08.750 --> 48:11.190
You okay? Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

48:11.310 --> 48:13.950
- (RONNIE MOANS)
- You're okay. You're okay.

48:15.610 --> 48:18.550
- What's her problem?
- Well, her fingers got stuck.

48:18.670 --> 48:21.510
Well, why aren't you helping?
What... what is wrong with you?

48:21.630 --> 48:23.670
- Please help us.
- Oow!

48:23.790 --> 48:25.590
- Oh, my... I...
- Oow!

48:25.710 --> 48:28.230
All right, all right, okay.
They're jammed in there good.

48:28.350 --> 48:31.350
This is the weirdest day
on the beach in 20 years.

48:31.470 --> 48:34.070
This guy's got a terrible case
of syphilis on his stomach.

48:34.190 --> 48:36.750
You've got can man over there
and then I got two...

48:36.870 --> 48:39.830
- Are you guys lesbians?
- Are you kidding me?

48:39.950 --> 48:42.390
- Help us!
- I'll help you to some law.

48:42.510 --> 48:45.630
That's fine. Do that, you fucking idiot!

48:45.750 --> 48:48.350
Okay, call your supervisor, just whatever!

48:48.470 --> 48:50.230
My supervisor?

48:52.510 --> 48:54.350
I'm the supervisor.

48:55.750 --> 48:57.510
I'm the one in charge.

48:57.630 --> 49:00.070
MITCH: Oh, my God. It's his shoes.

49:00.190 --> 49:02.110
Look at his feet.

49:02.230 --> 49:04.310
- You got something to say?
- No, sir.

49:04.430 --> 49:07.510
I wasn't talking to you, blondie.
I was talking to your little boyfriend.

49:07.630 --> 49:09.110
He's not my boyfriend.

49:09.230 --> 49:11.670
(MIMICS KAYLEE) "He's not my boyfriend."
What are you 12?

49:11.790 --> 49:15.470
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm talking to the guy that
you're shacking up with in a lifeguard stand.

49:15.590 --> 49:19.750
What do you call it now, Tinder connections?
What, did he poke you on Facebook?

49:19.870 --> 49:21.030
Sir...

49:21.150 --> 49:25.070
I'm sorry to insult your sensitive female
nature. What do you have to say for yourself?

49:25.190 --> 49:26.950
Dude, listen. We just...

49:27.070 --> 49:30.790
We think it's because of your shoes
that the sand's not eating you, I think.

49:30.910 --> 49:33.670
- Really?
- KAYLEE: Two of our friends died already.

49:33.790 --> 49:36.190
Two of your friends died?
Where are their bodies?

49:36.310 --> 49:39.110
- The sand ate them.
- The sand ate them?

49:39.230 --> 49:43.510
And you know what I did earlier today?
I rode in here on my unicorn.

49:43.630 --> 49:46.950
- You need to listen to us, okay?
- I don't want to hear from you, lady.

49:47.070 --> 49:51.310
Enough. I can't even look at you with your
shorts. It's like I'm committing a crime.

49:51.430 --> 49:54.430
- Please.
- I need you to come down here right now.

49:54.550 --> 49:56.230
Fuck no.

49:56.350 --> 49:58.790
Come down here, now.

49:58.910 --> 50:01.790
- Dude, we're not coming down there.
- You're not coming down?

50:01.910 --> 50:04.510
- You want to get sprayed?
- Please. We're hurt.

50:04.630 --> 50:07.430
Some of us are sick, dying maybe,

50:07.550 --> 50:10.350
and we really need your help, but we
cannot come anywhere near that sand.

50:11.390 --> 50:12.790
The hell you can't.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.510
I'm gonna come up.

50:14.630 --> 50:16.310
Please, just call somebody!

50:16.430 --> 50:18.150
Do not make me use force, ma'am.

50:18.270 --> 50:20.910
Do not make me use force.
You're coming down now.

50:21.030 --> 50:21.910
No!

50:22.030 --> 50:24.990
I'll get the spray. Goddamn it!

50:25.110 --> 50:26.790
- No, don't touch the sand!
- Ow!

50:35.990 --> 50:37.990
What the hell?

50:38.110 --> 50:39.750
Use the spray!

50:39.870 --> 50:41.630
Use the pepper spray!

50:43.630 --> 50:45.070
Aah! Aagh!

52:01.630 --> 52:04.150
This was our only chance.

52:04.270 --> 52:07.470
We're fucked! We are fucked, man!

52:09.990 --> 52:11.990
So what are we gonna do?

52:19.590 --> 52:20.550
These.

- What are you gonna do?

52:25.350 --> 52:27.990
Wrap my feet up.
I'm gonna run my ass off this thing.

52:28.110 --> 52:30.230
Okay, towels, seriously?

52:30.350 --> 52:32.590
This thing's eating through tyres.

52:32.710 --> 52:36.550
And it's also eating through wood. All right,
sooner or later, this thing's coming down.

52:36.670 --> 52:38.750
We got to be gone.

52:38.870 --> 52:40.830
Guys, I'm fast.

I'm fast as shit.

I just need the towels to work
for a second and I've got this.

52:45.710 --> 52:50.070
I'm gonna wrap my feet up, spray my feet down
with the pepper spray and make my move.

52:50.190 --> 52:52.990
Go to the cars, come back.
We're getting the fuck out of here.
