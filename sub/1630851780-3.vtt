WEBVTT

01:03.329 --> 01:04.364
Mine's next.

01:32.826 --> 01:33.793
Today, I'll win.

01:35.695 --> 01:38.932
It will die!

02:16.269 --> 02:17.237
No way.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.949
Do you know
how much my rooster was?

02:30.016 --> 02:31.551
You lose!
You have to pay, Tonhão.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.054
You know the rules very well.

02:36.022 --> 02:37.223
I don't give money to cheaters.

03:23.169 --> 03:24.337
EPISODE: AILTON

03:29.876 --> 03:30.843
What's up?

03:31.411 --> 03:32.745
Man, you haven't changed!

03:32.812 --> 03:35.181
Yes, I have!

03:37.217 --> 03:38.284
So lazy!

03:39.819 --> 03:42.188
-Remember Sergeant Malta?
-He was a despicable man.

03:42.255 --> 03:44.924
He could help you
get rid of that tummy, right?

03:44.991 --> 03:47.460
If I see him, I'll kill him!

03:47.527 --> 03:48.661
He liked you.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.396
He wouldn't leave me alone.

03:52.565 --> 03:53.666
Sergeant Malta...

03:54.367 --> 03:55.335
Waldir?

03:58.271 --> 04:00.573
I want you to be my best man.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.342
-You are getting married?
-I am.

04:02.408 --> 04:03.443
Who's the crazy bride?

04:04.711 --> 04:05.812
Vanda.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.080
Congratulations, Zé!

04:07.146 --> 04:08.414
She's the love of my life.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.017
Good, you are in love!

04:11.084 --> 04:13.086
-Yes.
-Best man?

04:13.152 --> 04:16.155
I'll throw you
the best bachelor party ever.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.490
It's going to be wild!

04:20.727 --> 04:21.694
What's wrong?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.396
Don't let me down.

04:24.697 --> 04:26.266
It won't be possible.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.569
We have some family issues
going on.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.404
What's going on?

04:34.173 --> 04:36.643
My future brother-in-law.
Ailton.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.113
He's been missing since Friday.

04:40.179 --> 04:42.015
Vanda's worried, desperate.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.183
She said if he doesn't show up,
the wedding's off.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.419
And I thought you missed me.

04:46.486 --> 04:47.453
Listen.

04:48.187 --> 04:49.322
I need you to help me.

04:49.922 --> 04:50.990
We'll work it out.

04:52.592 --> 04:53.559
I'll talk to Raul.

04:54.761 --> 04:55.828
Relax.

04:55.895 --> 04:58.531
You know I'm a little short
right now.

04:58.598 --> 05:01.234
What? Wedding present.

05:02.502 --> 05:04.037
That's what best men are for.

05:04.871 --> 05:05.838
Thanks.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.443
EVERY TWO MINUTES,
A PERSON GOES MISSING IN BRAZIL

05:15.081 --> 05:16.316
CANDY PALACE

05:21.821 --> 05:22.789
Hello, Tai!

05:23.156 --> 05:24.691
Have you thought of a name
for the dog?

05:25.191 --> 05:26.159
Guess.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.194
Waldir!

05:29.662 --> 05:30.630
So funny.

05:34.901 --> 05:35.835
ACCESS DENIED

05:40.273 --> 05:41.741
Not for free, Waldir.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.310
We served together, Raul.

05:45.111 --> 05:46.245
It's Zé.

05:46.312 --> 05:48.081
Oliveira was there.
He's getting married.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.482
He asked me to be his best man.

05:49.849 --> 05:52.151
And now this.
The bride's brother is missing.

05:52.218 --> 05:56.122
Not for free, don't you get it?

05:57.390 --> 05:59.425
This pen drive
is going to cause me trouble.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.760
Where did you get it?

06:00.827 --> 06:02.562
Somebody gave me
a statue of a saint.

06:03.930 --> 06:08.000
The person who gave it to me
wasn't particularly religious.

06:08.067 --> 06:11.437
I threw the statue to the floor,
and the pen drive was inside.

06:13.239 --> 06:16.409
Write down your date of birth
and who gave it to you.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.677
Fine.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.814
I'll have to leave a program
running all day.

06:23.249 --> 06:24.350
Fifty percent.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.486
That doesn't even pay
for the bus fee.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.655
It's difficult for you
to understand.

06:30.623 --> 06:32.859
Zé is my friend.

06:34.026 --> 06:36.062
Find a way to solve this
with another agency.

06:36.129 --> 06:37.397
That's impossible, Raul.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.099
I can't do this anywhere else.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.536
I'll give you
the sixty percent myself.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.673
Gas and lunch are on you.

06:48.541 --> 06:49.509
On me?

06:50.009 --> 06:52.645
If the case is complicated,
I'll eat you alive.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.183
My brother's run away
a few times before.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.553
But this time is serious,
I feel it in my guts.

07:01.654 --> 07:02.722
I went to his house.

07:02.789 --> 07:05.158
I asked his neighbors,
his cousins.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.192
Nobody's seen him.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.262
When did you last see him?

07:09.328 --> 07:10.296
We were at my place.

07:11.197 --> 07:14.167
He was helping us
organize the wedding.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.235
He was in charge of the flowers.

07:16.302 --> 07:18.104
He did everything fine.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.207
He does deliveries
with his motorbike, right?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.142
Do you know where his stop is?

07:23.976 --> 07:26.012
It's in Novo Mundo Park.

07:26.078 --> 07:27.113
Novo Mundo Park?

07:27.547 --> 07:31.784
I keep telling Vanda
that kid is always in trouble.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.521
Zé, you are always against him.
You have to stop.

07:35.588 --> 07:36.789
What kind of trouble?

07:47.133 --> 07:48.100
What kind of trouble?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.270
He was in the juvenile
correction center.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.906
But it was a long time ago.
And Zé won't forget about it.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.442
He paid for what he did.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.378
Does he have a girlfriend?

07:59.445 --> 08:01.914
Not just one, but many.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.318
I need a picture of him.
As recent as possible.

08:10.022 --> 08:11.190
Don't be sad.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.426
We're going to find
your brother.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.228
And you and Zé
are going to get married.

08:15.294 --> 08:17.864
Thanks, he's my little brother.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.599
We also need his address.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.434
Send us his picture.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.602
-Sure.
-Tell me.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.304
Dr. Caxoeirinho Street...

08:25.371 --> 08:27.173
I've been doing this
for four years.

08:28.875 --> 08:33.045
If some friends need help,
can they come here?

08:33.112 --> 08:34.180
Sure.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.849
Tell them to find me.
They we'll be well received.

08:37.917 --> 08:39.852
-Thanks.
-It will be my pleasure.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.211
Waldir?

09:13.853 --> 09:14.787
A gunshot.

10:00.566 --> 10:03.002
It's a .357-caliber bullet.

10:06.205 --> 10:07.773
Ailton Ramos,

10:08.107 --> 10:11.777
twenty eight years old,
tall, tattoo on his neck.

10:12.278 --> 10:14.580
He was last seen at Zé's house.

10:15.181 --> 10:18.250
Nobody gave me information
about that bullet.

10:18.818 --> 10:19.785
Look, Raul.

10:21.020 --> 10:22.688
The boy's on a social network.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.357
He likes to show off.

10:24.423 --> 10:27.226
He posts photos every day.
None since Friday.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.129
He's not in the morgue
or hospitals.

10:30.529 --> 10:34.233
Get me his number
to see if the GPS is active.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.368
Didn't I give it to you?

10:35.434 --> 10:36.602
But I asked Zé for it.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.306
-Did you receive it?
-Yes.

10:46.178 --> 10:47.146
Hey.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.315
I need Chico to examine this.

10:49.982 --> 10:50.983
And tell us what it is.

10:52.284 --> 10:53.719
Waldir's paying for it.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.221
What?

10:57.690 --> 10:59.225
Let's go. Novo Mundo Park.

11:01.794 --> 11:05.264
No, man.
I won't talk to the police.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.133
I'm not a cop.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.803
Ailton is responsible.
He's never absent.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.338
You know?

11:12.738 --> 11:14.807
Melão! Go do your job.

11:22.314 --> 11:24.784
I'm not a snitch!

11:35.728 --> 11:37.063
He always came here.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.700
He came with his nails done,

11:41.467 --> 11:42.735
his eyebrows mapped.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.905
Maybe because he's dating a girl
that works at a beauty salon.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.206
-Her name is Michelle.
-Yeah?

11:47.273 --> 11:48.474
Michelle.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.309
I remember something else.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.213
Sometimes he comes
and asks for money.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.483
Then he pays you back.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.619
-Double.
-Double?

12:00.686 --> 12:02.254
I don't know how he does it.

12:03.456 --> 12:05.858
Give me the address
of the salon, please.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.973
I don't understand how...

12:21.373 --> 12:23.809
a girl that seems
from an upper class...

12:23.876 --> 12:25.344
-Spoiled girl?
-Yes.

12:26.112 --> 12:28.280
...knows how to identify
something like this.

12:30.049 --> 12:31.317
My father taught me.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.588
He always liked guns.

12:36.388 --> 12:38.190
I've got medals
for sport shooting.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.393
As you can see...

12:43.229 --> 12:45.231
I'm really good at this job.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.702
Knowing how to shoot
doesn't find missing people.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.748
Upper class people!

13:03.983 --> 13:05.885
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello.

13:07.653 --> 13:08.988
Did you cut it yourself?

13:09.054 --> 13:10.289
Not myself.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.459
Let me do it.
You'll look awesome tonight.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.127
You will shine. Take a seat.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.162
No.

13:16.595 --> 13:20.065
Are you Michelle,
Ailton's girlfriend?

13:21.033 --> 13:22.535
If he said so.

13:23.636 --> 13:24.603
Who are you?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.107
Have you seen him
or talked to him this week?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.310
He's in trouble, right?
Of course.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.912
-Are you police officers?
-No!

13:32.978 --> 13:34.580
-You are.
-We are not.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.816
We just want to know
if you've talked to him.

13:37.616 --> 13:39.485
Honey, don't you see I'm busy?

13:39.552 --> 13:42.321
I'm in a hurry.
I have many clients waiting.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.256
I just need to know

13:44.323 --> 13:46.091
if you've talked to him
this week.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.360
No. I haven't.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.729
And I don't want to see him.

13:51.697 --> 13:55.434
If he comes around,
let us know, please.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.537
If he comes,
I'll make him disappear.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.173
I'll kick him out to the street,
you hear me?

14:02.141 --> 14:04.510
-Yes, thanks.
-Thanks.

14:04.577 --> 14:05.611
You are welcome.

14:13.819 --> 14:15.621
Raul, have you had lunch?

14:16.522 --> 14:19.091
Or dinner? Have you checked
your glucose level?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.395
I won't take care of you
anymore.

14:24.096 --> 14:25.097
Yeah, sure, Edith.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.399
And you should take care
of him, Waldir.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.639
-I love you, Edith.
-You deserve each other!

14:38.911 --> 14:41.247
I think he looks like an addict.

14:42.147 --> 14:45.651
How can he multiply the money
he asks for to his mates?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.420
Selling drugs, medicines?

14:51.257 --> 14:52.224
Will you see the kid?

14:52.725 --> 14:56.428
I'll try to take him home
to make him eat something.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.031
Good luck.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.967
I'm almost done. Go.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.535
Fine.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.344
Maria Júlia? Come.

15:14.713 --> 15:15.681
Did you make it?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.751
Look.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.595
Don't tell Raul about this.

15:30.396 --> 15:31.463
I can't do that.

15:32.097 --> 15:35.234
Raul's helped me a lot.
He trusts me.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.604
-I don't want to lie to him.
-I know.

15:40.706 --> 15:44.343
Give me a couple of days.
I'll tell him later.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.179
Okay?

15:47.513 --> 15:48.981
I'll ask you two things.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.951
Don't get me in trouble.
I've got people relying on me.

15:52.818 --> 15:54.987
And don't let Raul
make me questions about this.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.091
Fine.

16:00.059 --> 16:01.093
Let's see.

16:06.699 --> 16:07.967
-Anything?
-Gun trade

16:08.033 --> 16:10.135
from Argentina to Brazil.
It's something huge.

16:10.202 --> 16:11.270
Check this out.

16:11.337 --> 16:12.805
Do you see these amounts?

16:12.871 --> 16:15.808
Three monthly transfers
for low amounts

16:15.874 --> 16:17.109
and always the same date.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.144
Comparing
with these high amounts,

16:19.211 --> 16:21.413
the three lower ones
are weird, right?

16:21.480 --> 16:22.448
Yes.

16:23.849 --> 16:26.285
I'll check
who the account holder is.

16:26.919 --> 16:27.853
Fine.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.482
-How are you, darling?
-Fine.

16:59.118 --> 17:02.554
Look at this picture.
Do you recognize him?

17:03.655 --> 17:06.792
My dad transferred money
to his account

17:06.859 --> 17:07.960
for three months.

17:12.431 --> 17:13.399
Matias.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.068
A man of God.

17:16.602 --> 17:21.206
He helps immigrants
to find a house.

17:22.408 --> 17:23.675
A refuge.

17:23.742 --> 17:26.278
He helped me
in São Paulo in the 80's.

17:27.946 --> 17:28.914
Darling,

17:30.249 --> 17:32.751
that's war you cannot inherit.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.722
So, you are from Argentina.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.926
I was born in Brazil,
but raised in Argentina.

17:40.993 --> 17:42.261
My mom is Brazilian.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.595
Fine.

17:44.696 --> 17:48.400
I can see why Raul
tries to solve this puzzle.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.071
How did you end up
at "Ausentes"?

17:52.137 --> 17:54.540
I met Raul when he was captain.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.742
I worked for a games platform.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.445
I was so young.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.981
And my girlfriend...

18:04.149 --> 18:06.118
-What's that face?
-It's nothing.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.387
I imagined it,
but I wasn't sure.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.655
That I am a lesbian?

18:10.689 --> 18:11.757
Now you can be sure.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.026
I didn't ask for that.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.062
Okay.

18:17.863 --> 18:21.333
It's gross that man sends you
a drink to your table.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.434
Really.

18:22.501 --> 18:23.502
Tell me.

18:24.169 --> 18:26.672
We had a great problem
with her brother.

18:26.738 --> 18:29.608
She suffered a lot.
And then Raul appeared.

18:29.675 --> 18:32.444
Excuse me. Are you a model?

18:33.879 --> 18:34.847
No.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.450
I'm trying to tell a story
to my friend.

18:39.485 --> 18:40.552
Can I listen to it?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.823
Fine, you got me.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.994
I appeared on some TV ads.

18:49.461 --> 18:52.598
But I don't do fashion shows.
Give me your cellphone.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.134
I'll show you some pictures
from when I was a model.

18:56.602 --> 18:57.569
Give me a second.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.545
This is me.

19:06.612 --> 19:08.147
And this is you.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.282
Got it.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.118
Fine.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.453
What did you do?

19:15.621 --> 19:17.022
What did you do?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.525
This. Look.

19:19.591 --> 19:20.559
I'll go there.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.162
Watch.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.232
Tai, it's really good!

19:28.367 --> 19:29.801
Did you scan his cellphone?

19:29.868 --> 19:32.571
It's an excellent trick
to see who you are dating.

19:32.938 --> 19:33.906
Look.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.841
Married to Renata...

19:36.341 --> 19:37.743
He has a nice car,
don't you think?

19:37.809 --> 19:39.478
-Yes.
-Father to be.

19:39.912 --> 19:40.879
What a jerk.

19:41.346 --> 19:43.749
You have to teach me that.
I'm serious, Tai.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.617
-Teach me.
-Fine.

19:51.823 --> 19:52.791
Hello, Zé.

19:53.325 --> 19:54.293
Any news?

19:56.361 --> 19:59.131
It's fine, don't worry.
We'll check it later.

19:59.731 --> 20:00.766
Bye.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.403
Did you spend all night
working on the case?

20:06.438 --> 20:07.673
You don't look fine.

20:07.739 --> 20:08.707
Raul!

20:10.676 --> 20:11.910
Chico's analysis is here.

20:13.011 --> 20:14.546
The fluid found
is a cardiotonic drug.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.081
Cardiotonic?

20:16.481 --> 20:17.449
Speak.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.153
A cardiac stimulant for those
with serious chronic diseases.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.723
People usually take pills.
Injections...

20:25.524 --> 20:26.692
are rare.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.995
Don't leave the computer.
I need more information.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.136
Why did this guy use
that medicine?

20:38.203 --> 20:41.206
He must be getting high
in some dumpster.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.042
Sure.

20:46.979 --> 20:47.946
What's this?

20:52.284 --> 20:54.052
-What's this?
-Is it rice?

20:56.121 --> 20:57.089
Weird!

21:14.640 --> 21:15.607
Wow!

21:19.544 --> 21:20.512
So?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.552
Van Damme, 100.

21:28.987 --> 21:30.889
Maguila, 200.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.893
Remember he borrowed money

21:34.960 --> 21:36.762
and payed back double?

21:37.963 --> 21:38.964
Gambling?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.300
Here's an address.

21:45.570 --> 21:47.205
VETERINARY CENTER

21:47.806 --> 21:50.475
EUSEBIO EUGENIO STREET
DOS SANTOS, 509

22:09.027 --> 22:10.095
-Hello.
-Hello.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.129
How are you?

22:11.863 --> 22:13.498
Where can I buy some medicine?

22:17.703 --> 22:18.670
You mean this?

22:21.039 --> 22:23.809
It's time to put the money
on the table.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.577
Yeah, on the table.

22:26.144 --> 22:28.013
What are you doing? I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.948
-Talk now!
-I'll call the police.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.316
We are the police.

22:31.383 --> 22:33.452
-I've got nothing to do with it.
-Tell us!

22:33.518 --> 22:35.320
What? I've got nothing to say!

22:35.387 --> 22:36.355
Don't shout.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.990
Take your time. I'm in no rush.

23:31.877 --> 23:32.844
Raul!

23:43.088 --> 23:44.289
Cockfights?

23:45.090 --> 23:46.124
Isn't that illegal?

23:46.491 --> 23:48.493
There are many things
that are not legal.

23:48.794 --> 23:50.429
Raul, check this out.

23:50.495 --> 23:51.596
Do you see this cardiotonic?

23:52.230 --> 23:54.966
It's given to roosters
five minutes before the fight.

23:55.033 --> 23:57.469
They inject the animals with it.
It serves as an stimulant.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.237
It enhances their performances.

23:59.304 --> 24:00.439
Good information.

24:00.505 --> 24:03.708
A high-level rooster
can cost up to 50 grand.

24:03.775 --> 24:04.810
Or more.

24:05.544 --> 24:06.812
What can these be?

24:11.349 --> 24:12.684
They are spurs.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.653
They're used to hurt
the other rooster even more.

24:16.087 --> 24:19.825
Guess what I found out
while you were on your way here.

24:19.891 --> 24:20.859
Ailton...

24:22.060 --> 24:23.395
is on Finstagram.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.131
He has a fake Instagram account.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.233
They usually use them
to post things

24:28.300 --> 24:31.369
their family or friends
shouldn't know about.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.405
Like this!

24:34.973 --> 24:37.075
Van Damme.
A danger for the east zone.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.010
Seventeen wins and zero loses.

24:41.713 --> 24:42.681
There's more.

24:44.082 --> 24:45.050
Go follow him!

24:45.317 --> 24:47.552
Is he going to
bet on Van Damme? Raul!

24:54.025 --> 24:57.062
It seems your shadow
doesn't give you enough room.

24:58.363 --> 24:59.598
She's a good girl,
let's face it.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.199
You need to relax, Raul.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.870
She thinks I don't realize
she's using Tai.

25:15.747 --> 25:18.450
-Hello, Raul!
-How are you, Mr. Agenor?

25:18.517 --> 25:20.819
Driving around
with the air con on?

25:21.987 --> 25:23.321
I wanted to ask you something.

25:27.225 --> 25:28.193
Hello, Mr. Agenor.

25:29.194 --> 25:31.463
Raul, long time no see!

25:31.530 --> 25:33.532
Where are you investing
your money?

25:34.332 --> 25:36.101
I actually want to bet
on the rooster.

25:36.167 --> 25:37.903
On the rooster?

25:38.503 --> 25:41.039
The rooster came up
in the lottery last week.

25:41.706 --> 25:42.674
How much?

25:44.476 --> 25:46.378
I want to bet on a rooster,
for real.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.048
Do you know where I can do that
in the east zone?

25:52.183 --> 25:53.318
On Van Damme, Mr. Agenor.

26:10.201 --> 26:11.169
Matias?

26:13.505 --> 26:14.472
Hi.

26:15.507 --> 26:17.042
I'm looking for someone.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.312
Do you know him?

26:31.156 --> 26:32.724
You can trust me.
He's my father.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.828
Guiomar told me how you work.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.768
Guiomar is a special person.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.704
If she sent you here...

26:46.071 --> 26:47.405
I think you helped him.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.041
Look.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.243
Do you remember him?

26:55.146 --> 26:56.581
I saw your father some time ago.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.317
You saw him?

26:59.618 --> 27:02.387
I got him a place to stay.
That's all.

27:04.155 --> 27:05.290
I don't get involved.

27:06.257 --> 27:08.560
I just show them the way.
That's how it works.

27:08.627 --> 27:09.594
Wait!

27:11.396 --> 27:12.964
You need to take me there.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.534
Here.

27:20.905 --> 27:21.906
Give me your number.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.175
I'll call you.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.050
Hi!

27:32.717 --> 27:33.685
How are you?

27:34.686 --> 27:35.654
The tourist is here.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.857
If you want to work
for "Ausentes",

27:38.923 --> 27:40.959
stop coming and going
as you please.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.294
If I get a proper contract,
I'll stick to my schedule.

27:43.361 --> 27:44.429
Show me your work

27:44.496 --> 27:45.997
and maybe you get
to be my receptionist.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.967
There's a tense atmosphere
here today.

27:52.137 --> 27:53.104
You know what I think?

27:54.305 --> 27:58.376
This case is one
of the most common in the world.

27:59.644 --> 28:01.846
Ailton got Michelle pregnant

28:02.847 --> 28:04.649
and ran away
to avoid supporting her.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.285
How do you know that?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.554
-That Michelle is pregnant?
-Yes.

28:10.889 --> 28:13.024
I saw some boxes of folic acid

28:13.458 --> 28:15.794
on Michelle's reception table
at her beauty salon.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.429
What does that have to do
with anything?

28:17.495 --> 28:19.998
Nine of every ten women
take folic acid

28:20.065 --> 28:21.399
at the beginning
of their pregnancy.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.334
It happened to my cousin.

28:23.635 --> 28:25.270
And you tell us now?

28:26.237 --> 28:27.539
How does that change your case?

28:27.605 --> 28:31.443
Don't you see
every detail matters?

28:31.509 --> 28:34.045
Haven't you learnt anything
when you were a reporter?

28:34.112 --> 28:36.648
I think you need
a pair of female eyes

28:36.715 --> 28:37.982
in the street with you.

28:39.084 --> 28:40.618
-Don't you agree?
-Yes.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.765
Don't be upset, Michelle.

28:54.632 --> 28:56.000
It's not good for the baby.

28:57.268 --> 28:59.637
Baby? There's no longer a baby.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.143
Did Ailton make you
get rid of the baby?

29:05.844 --> 29:06.811
No!

29:09.314 --> 29:10.815
He wanted that baby.

29:12.517 --> 29:13.485
He wanted it so much.

29:14.686 --> 29:17.756
He wanted to call him Romeu,
you know?

29:19.324 --> 29:21.826
But I had a miscarriage.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.829
Ailton is always in trouble.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.898
He is a mess, but...

29:27.932 --> 29:29.134
He was going to be a good dad.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.336
I know that.

29:31.402 --> 29:34.773
He was trying to find a way
to make more money

29:34.839 --> 29:37.041
so that we could have
a better life.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.444
When did you last talk to him?

29:40.044 --> 29:41.112
Thursday night.

29:41.713 --> 29:44.048
When I told him I was pregnant.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.917
Nobody else knew about it.

29:47.619 --> 29:51.089
In fact, I haven't told him
I lost the baby yet.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.792
I must have called him 30 times.

29:54.492 --> 29:57.228
Why didn't you tell us all this
when we came yesterday?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.298
Because I thought Tonhão
had sent you.

30:02.100 --> 30:03.101
Who is Tonhão?

30:06.137 --> 30:07.672
He's a dangerous man.

30:08.573 --> 30:11.209
He bets on cockfights.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.979
And after what he did
to Ailton...

30:17.248 --> 30:19.851
He bet a lot of money, you know?

30:20.451 --> 30:22.654
And Van Damme killed Maguila.

30:23.988 --> 30:28.293
Maguila is
Tonhão's main rooster.

30:29.928 --> 30:31.863
I couldn't believe it
when I knew about it.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.331
The damage was already done.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.133
I get it.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.901
Calm down, okay?

30:38.036 --> 30:39.003
Relax.

30:48.012 --> 30:48.980
Yes?

30:51.583 --> 30:54.686
I have a question.
How do I bet on a fight?

30:56.154 --> 30:57.889
Do you have a rooster
or you just want to bet?

30:58.456 --> 30:59.424
Just bet.

31:01.626 --> 31:03.294
Is that sweetheart betting
as well?

31:04.829 --> 31:08.766
Listen, I already cooperate
so that I'm left alone.

31:09.801 --> 31:14.405
Talk to Cabeça,
see how you split the money.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.675
I'm not a cop. None of us are.

31:18.209 --> 31:21.212
I have no idea who Cabeça is.

31:21.279 --> 31:22.247
Tonhão...

31:24.449 --> 31:26.150
I'm a friend of Vanda's.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.685
She's Ailton sister.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.754
We know what happened
between you two.

31:29.821 --> 31:31.456
We're just looking for Ailton.

31:31.522 --> 31:35.693
If you know where he is,
could you tell us, please?

31:35.760 --> 31:38.162
Listen, sweetheart,
stay out of this.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.364
That jerk made a mistake.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.532
He knew the rules.
He played dirty.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.902
I ended up losing.

31:44.836 --> 31:48.172
You'd better get the hell
out of here.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.607
Now!

31:49.674 --> 31:52.243
We can work this out
the easy way

31:52.310 --> 31:54.646
or the hard way.

31:58.116 --> 31:59.083
You know.

31:59.717 --> 32:02.720
Do you want your workplace
to become a bloodbath?

32:04.122 --> 32:05.156
Tell me.

32:07.325 --> 32:10.194
I can see you get mad quickly.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.865
Your visit is worth it
just because of the girl.

32:14.399 --> 32:18.569
I need somebody
that gets my finances in order.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.405
What do you say?

32:21.839 --> 32:24.375
The pay is good,
and I'm very loving.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.946
Listen, we just need to know
where Ailton is.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.714
Then we'll leave.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.082
That bastard...

32:31.849 --> 32:33.785
Do you know
how much my Maguila was,

32:33.851 --> 32:35.286
how much money it made me win?

32:35.353 --> 32:36.554
What have you done to him?

32:36.854 --> 32:38.222
He played dirty!

32:38.790 --> 32:40.158
If his rooster
hadn't been drugged,

32:40.224 --> 32:41.359
it wouldn't have won.

32:41.659 --> 32:43.294
Have you killed Ailton?

32:43.361 --> 32:44.329
Not yet.

32:44.762 --> 32:46.798
But tell he, if he comes around,

32:46.864 --> 32:48.166
I'll feed him to the roosters.

32:50.335 --> 32:54.238
I heard he's getting the money
to fix this situation.

32:55.039 --> 32:56.975
We make a good couple.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.644
At the end of the day,
I'm looking for him too.

33:01.079 --> 33:02.747
It's not a bad idea, you know?

33:05.616 --> 33:06.985
Can I show you something?

33:07.685 --> 33:09.220
Can I borrow your phone?

33:12.223 --> 33:13.224
It's nothing!

33:14.959 --> 33:16.260
Just a photo...

33:17.895 --> 33:19.731
from when I was a model.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.601
Look.

33:26.070 --> 33:27.739
That's me, and that's you.

33:28.473 --> 33:31.142
You are beautiful and funny too.

33:32.810 --> 33:34.512
You'd better leave now.

33:34.579 --> 33:36.748
My hand is starting to itch.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.417
You should like my photos.

33:43.921 --> 33:44.889
What have you done?

33:45.456 --> 33:47.058
I've scanned Tonhão's cellphone.

33:47.792 --> 33:49.160
If he's really looking
for Ailton,

33:49.227 --> 33:50.661
he'll help us find him.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.031
Your friendship with Tai
is being fruitful.

33:53.931 --> 33:54.899
Let's go.

33:56.801 --> 33:58.870
Cockfights? I didn't know!

33:58.936 --> 34:02.607
He got a rap artist pregnant
and now he is into cockfighting?

34:02.673 --> 34:05.309
Pregnant? Who is pregnant?
Tell me now!

34:05.376 --> 34:07.812
He asked me not to tell you.
Let's talk about it later.

34:07.879 --> 34:10.748
-That's why I didn't tell you.
-He told you, and not me!

34:10.815 --> 34:11.783
And you didn't tell me!

34:12.984 --> 34:14.285
-He's your brother, not mine!
-You should have told me!

34:14.352 --> 34:16.087
I'll let you both talk, okay?

34:16.687 --> 34:18.556
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Calm down.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.591
-I didn't...
-Who is she? Tell me!

34:20.658 --> 34:23.094
-I don't know. Ask him!
-But he told you!

34:23.161 --> 34:24.395
What a mess, Waldir.

34:27.265 --> 34:28.232
What do you mean?

34:29.100 --> 34:30.635
You fell in your friend's trap.

34:31.602 --> 34:34.939
I see why Zé lied to Vanda
about the pregnancy,

34:35.006 --> 34:37.341
but why did he lie to us?

34:37.942 --> 34:39.410
Zé knew
about Ailton's girlfriend.

34:39.477 --> 34:40.745
Why didn't he say anything?

34:41.579 --> 34:42.547
Listen, Waldir,

34:43.114 --> 34:45.616
go to Zé's house to investigate.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.251
That man is lying. Why?

34:48.019 --> 34:50.421
Are you asking me
to break into his house?

34:51.022 --> 34:52.457
If you won't do it, I will.

34:52.790 --> 34:54.125
I'll be in the car.

34:54.192 --> 34:56.761
If I go, I'm sure
I'm going to find something.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.330
Go, Raul! Yes, go!

35:00.164 --> 35:01.933
I have a friend and I trust him.

35:02.633 --> 35:03.901
Everything was okay, Waldir.

35:04.168 --> 35:06.938
That bastard disappears,

35:07.438 --> 35:08.940
and all this happens.

35:09.006 --> 35:10.208
My argument with Vanda.

35:10.641 --> 35:13.144
The wedding!
Too much pressure. It's hard.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.746
Yes. My son causes me trouble.

35:16.080 --> 35:17.048
He does.

35:17.748 --> 35:19.050
He's not even my son.

35:20.184 --> 35:21.486
Fill my glass, Waldir

35:21.552 --> 35:22.653
We'll fix this, Zé.

35:36.501 --> 35:38.736
Lorena asked me to sign
the divorce papers.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.538
After all these years.

35:41.272 --> 35:43.241
Ghosts from the past, my friend.

35:44.775 --> 35:46.878
I think it's going to help you
move on.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.647
But it's all coming back, again.

35:50.882 --> 35:51.849
Memories.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.420
If you wanted
to talk about your ex,

35:56.487 --> 35:58.022
we should have gone
for a drink, right?

35:58.089 --> 35:59.957
You're heartless!

36:00.892 --> 36:02.793
Is that position
changing you already?

36:15.840 --> 36:18.109
I found this
at some guy's house.

36:18.476 --> 36:19.844
I need to see his file.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.448
Tell me his name.

36:41.165 --> 36:42.366
Hi, love.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.035
Yes, I'm home.

36:44.769 --> 36:45.736
Will you forgive me?

36:46.437 --> 36:48.072
I didn't mean to.

36:48.639 --> 36:49.974
Okay, we'll talk about it late.

36:50.775 --> 36:52.810
I'm talking to Waldir.
He will help me.

36:54.645 --> 36:57.949
Vanda, I know. Vanda?
Relax, I know!

36:58.015 --> 37:00.151
Listen to me.
Why are you shouting?

37:01.118 --> 37:03.387
I know. Clam down, please!

37:03.754 --> 37:05.957
Arguing doesn't get you
anywhere.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.259
We are going to find him

37:10.928 --> 37:13.497
He has to be somewhere,
trust me.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.166
Vanda, listen to me.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.168
We are arguing like idiots,

37:17.235 --> 37:19.770
and he must be having fun
out there.

37:20.204 --> 37:21.939
You don't need to worry, love.

37:22.673 --> 37:23.641
I'm going to find him.

37:26.177 --> 37:27.445
Bye. I love you.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.146
Zé?

37:29.213 --> 37:30.348
A hitman?

37:30.681 --> 37:32.516
Some time ago,
he was under investigation

37:32.583 --> 37:35.152
because of some deaths
related to an alleged hitman

37:35.219 --> 37:36.187
in the east zone.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.256
He always used the same gun.

37:39.223 --> 37:40.191
A .357 gun.

37:41.459 --> 37:42.426
Damn it!

37:43.794 --> 37:45.863
MISSING CHILDREN IN SÃO PAULO

37:45.930 --> 37:47.098
ADOPTION

37:47.164 --> 37:48.466
Those papers are mine!

37:49.200 --> 37:50.801
Those papers are mine!

37:50.868 --> 37:53.170
Leave me alone! Damn it!

37:53.604 --> 37:56.207
-Come.
-They are my papers!

38:01.812 --> 38:03.247
What are you investigating?

38:03.881 --> 38:04.949
You're not up to the task.

38:05.683 --> 38:06.651
Just go.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.258
Thanks.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.127
Is this some kind of joke?

38:16.193 --> 38:17.728
I trusted you!

38:17.995 --> 38:19.764
Why is this cellphone here?
Where's the boy?

38:19.830 --> 38:21.299
This cellphone means nothing.

38:21.932 --> 38:23.234
Where is he?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.236
I don't know.
I'm looking for him too.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.874
I love you, Zé, but I hate lies.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.042
Easy.

38:31.409 --> 38:33.010
Tell me! Where is he?

38:33.077 --> 38:35.479
I don't know.
I'm looking for him too.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.415
I scared him off.
He disappeared.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.950
You decided to kill him
in this house and with this gun.

38:40.017 --> 38:41.552
No! No, I didn't!

38:41.619 --> 38:43.621
He found out about my past
and wanted to tell Vanda.

38:43.688 --> 38:44.922
A hitman?

38:46.557 --> 38:49.193
But he used to give food
to homeless people.

38:50.461 --> 38:52.730
See? People aren't always
who they say they are.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.498
See?

38:54.832 --> 38:55.900
Yes, Tai.

38:55.966 --> 38:58.169
I intercepted a message
from Tonhão's cellphone.

38:58.469 --> 39:00.471
They found out where Ailton is.

39:00.538 --> 39:03.074
He's on his way there.
He intends to kill him.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.411
He found out about my past
and wanted to tell Vanda.

39:07.478 --> 39:09.046
He wanted me to kill a man
called Tonhão.

39:09.113 --> 39:10.815
I said no, and he...

39:12.750 --> 39:15.252
Vanda is everything for me.
She's my entire life!

39:15.319 --> 39:16.654
-Tell me.
-Your good friend

39:16.721 --> 39:19.357
used to be the most-wanted
hitman in the east zone.

39:19.423 --> 39:20.991
-They're talking about you.
-Listen, Waldir.

39:21.058 --> 39:22.460
-I'm with him.
-We found him.

39:22.793 --> 39:24.795
-I'll send you the address.
-I'm on my way.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.049
Look at him!

40:19.583 --> 40:21.986
He looks like a scared hen.

40:23.621 --> 40:26.957
Do you have any idea
how much money you made me lose?

40:27.024 --> 40:28.626
I told you I'd fix this.

40:28.692 --> 40:29.994
I will.

40:31.128 --> 40:32.096
Relax.

40:32.863 --> 40:34.799
Nothing is going to happen
to you.

40:36.867 --> 40:37.802
Good boy!

40:46.744 --> 40:48.979
Good. Now you're mine.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.418
Don't move! Stay still!

40:55.219 --> 40:56.187
Still!

40:56.520 --> 40:58.155
Game over, Tonhão.

40:59.356 --> 41:00.391
Don't move.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.763
-You're always in trouble!
-Calm down, Zé.

41:05.830 --> 41:08.332
-What did I tell you?
-Put your gun down.

41:08.399 --> 41:10.067
I won't tell my sister.
Calm down.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.903
I was doing that anymore,
and you tried to bribe me!

41:12.970 --> 41:15.239
You asked me to kill Tonhão,
and I don't even know him!

41:15.306 --> 41:17.174
-I'm sorry.
-Relive my past like that?

41:17.241 --> 41:18.542
Why, man?

41:22.246 --> 41:23.214
Zé?

41:24.381 --> 41:26.917
Please, you can't kill him
over this.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.453
Zé, listed to me.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.288
That Zé does no longer
exist, Waldir.

41:31.355 --> 41:33.591
I'm sure he'll tell Vanda
about my past.

41:33.657 --> 41:35.125
She'll leave me.

41:35.192 --> 41:37.361
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

41:37.428 --> 41:39.363
-I'm not going to forgive you!
-I was desperate!

41:39.430 --> 41:41.832
Why do you want me
to relive my past?

41:41.899 --> 41:43.667
-No, Zé!
-You'll learn your lesson, then!

41:43.734 --> 41:45.836
I'm not going to tell my sister.
She loves you.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.105
She does, and you know it.

41:48.172 --> 41:50.708
What else could I do?
Tonhão wanted to kill me!

41:51.141 --> 41:53.611
Damn it, I'm sorry! Please!

41:55.012 --> 41:56.280
I'm going to have a baby, Zé.

41:57.014 --> 41:58.482
I'm going to have a baby,
you know?

41:58.549 --> 41:59.517
You're my family!

42:00.951 --> 42:02.720
You are all I have!

42:05.890 --> 42:07.458
You and your sister
are all I have!

42:07.525 --> 42:08.526
I'm sorry.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.969
Tai wants to see you.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.840
What is going to happen
to Tonhão?

42:24.275 --> 42:26.410
Do you see why you're not made
for working with me?

42:27.111 --> 42:28.279
You're too emotional.

42:28.345 --> 42:29.413
That's not true.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.515
We solved the case thanks to me,
and you know it.

42:31.916 --> 42:35.119
Hey, guys,
I've been waiting for you.

42:35.185 --> 42:36.287
-I told them.
-Let's go celebrate.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.055
-Let's go.
-Okay, Waldir.

42:38.122 --> 42:41.525
What happens to Tonhão
is none of your business.

42:41.592 --> 42:43.260
We solved the case,
and that's what matters.

42:43.627 --> 42:44.595
That's how this works.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.798
If I were you,
I wouldn't miss this.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.039
Edith, have a drink.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.007
Someone has to open
the store tomorrow.

42:57.074 --> 42:58.509
Just one glass, come on.

42:58.976 --> 43:00.444
Just one, Edith!

43:01.612 --> 43:03.247
You want to buy me off, right?

43:03.314 --> 43:04.381
If it helps.

43:05.482 --> 43:07.318
Why are we celebrating?

43:07.384 --> 43:09.453
Because of our new acquisition.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.322
Really?

43:11.855 --> 43:13.624
We have to discuss some things.

43:13.691 --> 43:15.960
-Like what?
-Salary, schedule...

43:16.026 --> 43:19.597
If you keep asking,
it'll be your shortest job ever.

43:20.197 --> 43:21.165
True.

43:21.865 --> 43:22.833
I'll shut up.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.873
You're getting into trouble,
and you know it.

43:45.022 --> 43:46.690
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE HITMAN?

43:46.757 --> 43:48.492
NO. I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF I FIND SOMETHING OUT.

44:06.777 --> 44:08.112
CANDY PALACE

44:32.302 --> 44:34.371
It's been ages
since I last came here.

44:34.438 --> 44:35.305
I don't know how it looks like.

44:35.372 --> 44:35.606
I don't know how it looks like.
