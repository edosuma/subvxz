[instrumental music]

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
[music intensifies]

01:10.360 --> 01:12.560
Transport for London
have given me his address.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.480
-Witnesses?
-None so far.

01:18.480 --> 01:19.920
Rob not with you?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.320
Got the message saying
he'll be in later.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.760
What have we got here?

01:23.920 --> 01:28.720
Luis Amoretti attended
Rodgers College. 16.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.200
No sign of his phone yet.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.040
Sustained an injury
at the back of the head,

01:34.200 --> 01:35.920
inconsistent with a fall.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.680
First impressions suggest
that he was hit,

01:38.840 --> 01:40.160
then dragged into the water.

01:42.120 --> 01:43.440
Any idea of time frame?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.520
About an hour ago, tops.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.280
So, between half-eight
and half-nine this morning.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.160
He also has some bruising
around his right eye

01:50.320 --> 01:52.960
which is two or three days old.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.880
I'll speak to the school.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.520
Any details for next of kin?

01:56.680 --> 01:59.480
Dad's a solicitor.
Mum's a social worker.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.120
A phone would be useful,
as would a murder weapon.

02:10.440 --> 02:11.720
[suspenseful music]

02:16.040 --> 02:18.840
[upbeat music]

02:31.760 --> 02:33.120
[knocking]

02:37.000 --> 02:38.520
Detective Sergeant Cole

02:38.680 --> 02:41.400
and this is trainee
Detective Constable Fitzgerald.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.360
Are you Mgrs.. Amoretti?

02:43.520 --> 02:46.960
Yes. What?
Is it Louis?

02:47.120 --> 02:49.360
Can we come in?

02:49.520 --> 02:51.720
The school called.
He wasn't at registration.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.920
Where is he?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.440
Shall we go inside?

02:57.280 --> 02:58.920
[mellow music]

03:10.360 --> 03:13.160
It's bad, isn't it? I can tell.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.200
A boy in possession of
your son's travel card

03:16.360 --> 03:17.760
and school pass has been found.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.240
No.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.160
Dead?

03:26.320 --> 03:29.280
He appears to match
your son's photo,

03:29.440 --> 03:32.960
and from the photos in here.
I'm sorry.

03:33.120 --> 03:36.480
[cries]
No he's not.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.320
He can't be.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.960
Where was he found?

03:41.120 --> 03:43.760
In the park on the other side
of the high road.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.640
That's not on his way to school.

03:48.800 --> 03:52.440
Look I, I know
this a lot to take in,

03:52.600 --> 03:54.200
but can you think of anyone

03:54.360 --> 03:56.840
who might have had
a problem with Louis,

03:57.000 --> 03:59.160
or anything that can help us
with our enquiry?

03:59.320 --> 04:01.000
[crying]

04:01.160 --> 04:04.480
Oh, he's such a good lad.
He's never in trouble.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.080
[sighs]

04:06.240 --> 04:07.600
Um, with your permission,

04:07.760 --> 04:10.640
can my colleague
go and look in Louis' room?

04:17.080 --> 04:18.360
[cries]

04:21.320 --> 04:23.840
[mellow music]

04:53.320 --> 04:54.200
[clears throat]

04:54.360 --> 04:56.000
There was some bruising

04:56.160 --> 04:59.840
around your son's right eye
that looks a few days old.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.440
Do you know how he got it?

05:02.600 --> 05:05.600
Five-a-side football
on a Monday night.

05:05.760 --> 05:09.360
He ran into some kid's elbow.

05:09.520 --> 05:11.600
Louis told you that?

05:11.760 --> 05:13.880
I didn't just make it up.

05:14.040 --> 05:15.360
Of course.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.440
How did Louis normally travel
to school?

05:20.600 --> 05:22.760
Bus.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.080
Alone?

05:24.240 --> 05:25.880
With friends?

05:26.040 --> 05:27.920
Alone, I think.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.200
I mean he, he may see
mates on the way.

05:31.360 --> 05:34.240
We didn't really talk about it.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.680
How would you describe
your relationship with Louis?

05:39.040 --> 05:40.160
Mine?

05:40.320 --> 05:42.160
Both of you.

05:42.320 --> 05:43.600
What are you getting at?

05:43.760 --> 05:46.400
I, I'm just trying to
build a picture.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.000
You think that I gave him
the black eye,

05:49.160 --> 05:50.200
is that what you're saying?

05:50.360 --> 05:51.720
Of course not.

05:53.240 --> 05:54.440
[cries]
I'm sorry.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.240
[gasps]
I need some air.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.400
[music continues]

06:11.080 --> 06:12.920
[upbeat music]

06:18.720 --> 06:20.400
-Billie!
-He's gone.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.440
I know. You stay here.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.120
Control, can officers look out
for a red Volvo 4x4,

06:29.280 --> 06:32.880
registration number
O-U-10 G-O-P.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.320
[male #1]Received.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.160
Can I try calling him
from your mobile please?

06:37.320 --> 06:38.760
[intense music]

06:41.480 --> 06:43.760
[panting]

06:43.920 --> 06:45.680
[phone vibrates]

06:49.800 --> 06:51.720
[engaged tone]

06:58.040 --> 07:00.400
[male #1]DS Cole, we got your
vehicle sighting request

07:00.560 --> 07:02.440
has been retrenched
at 3 Wadsworth Street.

07:02.600 --> 07:03.880
A report of a disturbance
in progress.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.120
Both units attending.

07:06.280 --> 07:07.920
All received, thank you.

07:11.040 --> 07:13.080
It was you.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.960
You killed my son!

07:16.120 --> 07:17.600
Wait! That is enough!

07:17.760 --> 07:19.200
You killed my son.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.680
I am arresting both of you
for affray.

07:21.840 --> 07:24.520
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

07:24.680 --> 07:26.520
if you do not mention
when questioned

07:26.680 --> 07:28.840
something which you later
rely on in court.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.720
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

07:31.880 --> 07:32.920
Do you understand?

07:34.440 --> 07:35.800
[panting]

08:10.960 --> 08:12.400
Why are the cops here?

08:12.560 --> 08:14.200
[boy #1]No idea.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.920
Form class first please.
Kids that knew him best.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.040
Then we'll move onto
the rest of the year group.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.640
Yes, of course.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.520
[mellow music]

08:43.680 --> 08:45.600
Do you have any idea
where your husband is going?

08:50.000 --> 08:53.720
Now there is just the two of us,
if there is...

08:53.880 --> 08:58.360
anything at all you want to
tell me about home life or...

08:58.520 --> 09:02.200
Enzo would never lay a finger
on anyone, especially Louis.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.160
Is it okay if I just bag up
a few bits and pieces

09:07.320 --> 09:08.360
to take back to the station?

09:08.520 --> 09:09.920
Whatever you need to do.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.360
[cries]

09:20.680 --> 09:22.400
Did Louis have a girlfriend?

09:22.560 --> 09:24.080
Not that I knew about.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.800
Did you hear of anyone called
Tara.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.560
No...don't think so.

09:38.720 --> 09:41.800
To be honest since he's been
at secondary, I don't...

09:44.680 --> 09:46.960
I didn't know nearly
as much as I used to.

09:52.560 --> 09:54.480
[instrumental music]

10:06.840 --> 10:08.200
Hello.

10:10.080 --> 10:11.400
Your name is?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.160
Owen Telford.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.720
I'm afraid I have some
difficult news for you.

10:20.480 --> 10:25.520
One of your classmates
Louis Moretti, he's died.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.040
He was found this morning.

10:30.120 --> 10:33.120
I'm sorry.
I know it must be a shock.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.760
Hm...

10:35.920 --> 10:37.560
He was my best mate.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.600
Are you okay?

10:46.280 --> 10:47.760
[sniffles]

10:50.200 --> 10:51.640
Did he kill himself?

10:55.160 --> 10:56.800
No. He didn't.

10:59.840 --> 11:03.840
There must be a reason you think
Louis might have killed himself.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.920
Owen, if he was having any
problems with friends or at home

11:07.080 --> 11:09.280
it's very important that you
tell me, do you understand?

11:10.720 --> 11:15.600
Look, the only reason
I said that

11:15.760 --> 11:17.120
is because they're always
banging on

11:17.280 --> 11:19.200
about that sort of stuff here,
you know?

11:19.360 --> 11:21.640
Mental health, look out for
each other or something.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.040
I don't know.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.520
He seemed alright.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.520
Maybe quieter than normal.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.520
Same old Louis.

11:32.680 --> 11:35.080
And when did you last see him?

11:35.240 --> 11:36.720
Yesterday, end of school.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.080
Why were you late for school
this morning?

11:46.320 --> 11:47.640
Missed my bus.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.120
[music continues]

12:03.600 --> 12:05.480
I've been a Defence Lawyer
for over 20 years.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.600
This is a total waste of time.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.400
I shouldn't have hit
Rodney McCoy, I admit that,

12:10.560 --> 12:13.560
but he made some serious threats
against me and my family.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.040
What threats?

12:18.400 --> 12:22.040
I defended his brother,
Desmond McCoy.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.320
Rodney McCoy tried to persuade
me to obtain a false statement

12:26.480 --> 12:28.600
from an associate of his.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.280
I refused.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.240
So, Desmond gets 11 years

12:33.400 --> 12:36.200
and Rodney turns up
at my offices a few days ago

12:36.360 --> 12:37.680
telling me that
I'm gonna be sorry,

12:37.840 --> 12:39.640
and, and all that.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.720
So, you, you think that
he killed Louis to get revenge?

12:42.880 --> 12:44.760
I don't think. I know.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.960
Bail him. Let him get back
to his grieving wife.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.720
Will do.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.120
I thought you were going to
talk to Rob,

12:55.280 --> 12:56.680
'cause it's getting ridiculous.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.000
He's not in a good place.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.680
But he's not doing his job.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.400
Yesterday he was talking
about jacking it all in.

13:03.560 --> 13:05.400
[upbeat music]

13:19.320 --> 13:22.040
Louis doesn't seem to be
an obvious murder victim.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.320
Didn't stand out,
kept himself to himself.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.320
But bright,
on the football team.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.720
So, it could just be a case of
wrong kid in the wrong place.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.360
But he wasn't on his
normal route to school.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.840
His mobile still hasn't been
found.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.920
Cell site and call data
have been requested.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.360
We need to see what
Rodney McCoy has to say.

13:43.240 --> 13:44.880
Chief Superintendent.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.360
David.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.160
Actually, I'm here to see you

13:48.320 --> 13:50.760
trainee Detective
Constable Fitzgerald.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.600
Or should I say
Detective Constable Fitzgerald.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.520
You'll be getting an email
from us soon.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.680
I just wanted to congratulate
you in person.

13:59.840 --> 14:03.200
[giggles]
Thank you, sir.

14:03.360 --> 14:05.280
-Do you have a moment?
-Sir.

14:08.920 --> 14:11.080
[Vivienne]Congratulations.

14:11.240 --> 14:14.680
Where is Detective Constable
Brady?

14:14.840 --> 14:19.080
He's uh...he's taken
a half day's leave.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.920
Did I not send you to the pub
to clear the air with him?

14:22.080 --> 14:23.760
I did.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.240
If you can't sort out your team,
David,

14:25.400 --> 14:26.920
I'll have to do it for you.

14:34.400 --> 14:35.880
Officers at the scene

14:36.040 --> 14:39.720
witnessed you punching
Mr. Moretti in the face.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.320
Yeah, well, he turned up
on my doorstep

14:41.480 --> 14:43.840
and started having a go at me.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.720
What's a man to do?

14:45.880 --> 14:48.400
Why would Mr. Moretti
want to attack you?

14:48.560 --> 14:50.600
No idea.

14:50.760 --> 14:53.080
Have you ever been to
Mr. Moretti's office?

14:53.240 --> 14:59.080
Yeah, once, with my brother
when he got in a bit of trouble.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.080
Just that time?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.800
Yeah. Why?

15:05.200 --> 15:08.320
Can you tell me where you were
this morning?

15:08.480 --> 15:11.240
[sniffs]
I was at home.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.280
Is there anyone who can
corroborate that?

15:15.280 --> 15:19.640
My missus is in Milton Keynes,
visiting her sister.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.600
So, Billie's checking on
Rodney McCoy's visits

15:32.760 --> 15:34.360
to Enzo Moretti's office.

15:37.520 --> 15:38.760
Why haven't you been picking up?

15:38.920 --> 15:40.440
I switched my phone off.

15:40.600 --> 15:41.880
Using a "pay-as-you-go".

15:42.040 --> 15:43.360
What's going on?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.680
Yesterday on the way to the lab
I was robbed.

16:00.840 --> 16:01.800
What was taken?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.160
They smashed up mobile

16:03.320 --> 16:06.080
from the Harry Steadman
murder investigation.

16:06.240 --> 16:08.200
There was a guy in a hoodie.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.880
He shoved his phone in my face
and he had a video on there

16:12.040 --> 16:15.960
that was shot in the twins,
in the twins bedroom.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.360
The threat couldn't have been
clearer.

16:20.520 --> 16:21.480
Where are Cherry
and the kids now?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.040
Safe.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.680
Why didn't you call us?
This needs reporting.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.680
No offense, boss, but

16:28.840 --> 16:31.280
I don't trust anyone
in this building right now.

16:31.440 --> 16:32.840
How did this guy know

16:33.000 --> 16:34.800
that I was taking that mobile
back to the lab?

16:37.680 --> 16:38.960
What?

16:41.920 --> 16:45.480
We suspect that Tyler Bates,
Grace Harper and Harry Steadman

16:45.640 --> 16:48.880
were all killed
by the same person.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.600
We further suspect that person
is a serving police officer.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.000
Well seriously?

16:55.160 --> 16:58.640
Whatever was on that phone
must incriminate him.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.960
The guy that took the phone
from you, what did he look like?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.480
Ugh!

17:03.640 --> 17:07.200
Male IC1, five, ten or eleven.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.320
Medium build, beard,

17:09.480 --> 17:13.400
dark glasses,
a hoodie, London accent.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.480
That doesn't sound anything
like your target.

17:15.640 --> 17:21.560
No, but he tipped off this one
who came after Rob believe me.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.200
Y-your target?

17:23.360 --> 17:26.240
[sighs]
You don't need to know.

17:26.400 --> 17:28.240
So, what happens now?

17:28.400 --> 17:30.200
I want you to give me
a statement,

17:30.360 --> 17:33.560
so I can generate a covet
investigation into the robbery,

17:33.720 --> 17:38.040
and I want you to act
like everything is normal.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.480
Now that I'm sure
that my family's safe

17:41.640 --> 17:42.960
I just want to go back
to my job.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.360
No, I'm glad to hear it.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.320
We've got the unexplained death
of a school boy.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.560
If you could chase at
where we're at

17:48.720 --> 17:51.600
with forensics and local
enquiries...

17:51.760 --> 17:53.160
Okay.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.720
And, Rob...

17:55.880 --> 17:59.760
We'll catch this guy,
I promise you.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.000
[mellow music]

18:04.080 --> 18:06.120
[exhales deeply]

18:07.840 --> 18:10.280
Well, we both know
who tipped the killer off

18:10.440 --> 18:11.720
about Rob having that phone.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.240
You think you know?

18:13.400 --> 18:15.400
You haven't got
a shred of proof.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.920
[music intensifies]

18:25.600 --> 18:27.200
Enzo Moretti's colleagues
confirmed

18:27.360 --> 18:29.760
Rodney McCoy did make threats
at the office two days ago.

18:29.920 --> 18:32.440
So, McCoy lied then.

18:32.600 --> 18:34.320
Go and arrest him
for the murder.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
Leave him to stew on it
in the cells.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.600
Then break his
"stayed at home" alibi.

18:38.760 --> 18:39.800
Yeah.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.000
I also spoke
to the football coach.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.920
Louis didn't sustain any
injuries at training.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.520
So, either Louis lied
to his father

18:49.680 --> 18:51.720
or his father lied to us.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.760
SOCOs have found
the murder weapon.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.000
Looks like Louis was
hit over the head with a brick

18:56.160 --> 18:58.240
and then pushed into the water.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.560
Anything else?

18:59.720 --> 19:00.920
His service provider
has got back to us

19:01.080 --> 19:02.280
over the victim's phone

19:02.440 --> 19:03.480
and there was a call made
to Louis' phone

19:03.640 --> 19:05.560
at 8:23 this morning

19:05.720 --> 19:08.280
from a "pay-as-you-go"
that's currently switched off.

19:08.440 --> 19:12.160
I've applied for cell site
and call data.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.920
Probably the last person
to speak to Louis.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.520
[upbeat music]

19:32.760 --> 19:34.120
[knock on door]

19:35.720 --> 19:38.200
It's been confirmed
that your son drowned,

19:38.360 --> 19:41.320
but his death was not
an accident or a suicide.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.040
It's now officially
a murder investigation.

19:44.200 --> 19:47.320
My team will be in contact.

19:47.480 --> 19:48.800
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:50.640 --> 19:55.240
Those calls, they, uh...
they never get any easier.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.080
The face-to-face where
I tell them

19:57.240 --> 19:59.200
their son would have survived
the head injury

19:59.360 --> 20:03.080
if he hadn't gone into the water
is going to be even harder.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.160
Hm.

20:05.320 --> 20:09.240
I see Detective Constable Brady
is in.

20:09.400 --> 20:11.120
That's right.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.600
How is he?

20:13.760 --> 20:17.040
Actually, there was
an incident last night.

20:17.200 --> 20:20.600
He was robbed of evidence
outside the forensics lab.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.200
What was taken?

20:24.360 --> 20:25.840
The phone Rob found

20:26.000 --> 20:29.560
at the house where
Harry Steadman was murdered.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.280
The guy threatened Rob's kids.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.880
Right. He and his family
need police protection.

20:36.040 --> 20:37.200
I'll get somebody onto it.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.480
[David]He's got it under
control.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.840
When it comes to Rob's family

20:42.000 --> 20:44.520
he likes to
take care of things himself.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.600
Fair enough.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.280
Let me know if there's anything
I can do.

20:50.440 --> 20:52.080
Thank you, sir.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.320
[instrumental music]

21:09.800 --> 21:11.640
Cell site analysis
on Rodney McCoy's phone

21:11.800 --> 21:14.320
pin-points him miles away
from his home at 8:40.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.760
It triangulates to a row of
lock-ups

21:16.920 --> 21:20.720
and I got his keys from custody.
Shall we?

21:20.880 --> 21:22.160
[upbeat music]

21:38.440 --> 21:40.280
How's your family doing?

21:40.440 --> 21:42.000
They're upset.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.480
The kids don't understand
why they've had to move.

21:44.640 --> 21:46.760
Why they can't see me.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.600
It's difficult.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.320
Oh, Rob.

22:04.080 --> 22:05.960
[Rob]It looks like
Rodney's been a naughty boy.

22:10.280 --> 22:11.920
[Vivienne]Yes.

22:19.240 --> 22:21.360
We've just found the proceeds
of a hijacked lorry

22:21.520 --> 22:23.080
in your lock-up, Mr. McCoy.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.200
[exhales deeply]

22:31.240 --> 22:33.400
It's not my lock-up.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.000
Why then do you have
a key to it?

22:37.680 --> 22:39.480
You said you were home earlier

22:39.640 --> 22:41.680
but your mobile suggests that
you were at these garages

22:41.840 --> 22:43.480
on Hallum Street

22:43.640 --> 22:46.320
at the time of the murder
that we're investigating.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.920
Did you give your phone
to someone else?

22:49.080 --> 22:52.960
[sniffs]
Okay.

22:53.120 --> 22:56.240
If I cough to all that gear on
Hallum Street

22:56.400 --> 22:57.920
you better believe me

22:58.080 --> 22:59.840
when I say I never touched
that Moretti kid.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.480
[scoffs]
Why should we?

23:02.640 --> 23:04.960
I was hardly going to say
where I was this morning, was I?

23:05.120 --> 23:06.560
I'm not stupid.

23:10.200 --> 23:11.840
I'm not.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.320
We also have witness statements

23:13.480 --> 23:14.840
saying that you made
serious threats

23:15.000 --> 23:16.960
to Mr. Moretti at his offices.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.160
That's two of your comments
we've disproved so far.

23:20.840 --> 23:23.480
[sniffs]
Alright.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.120
I did meet his lad once.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.600
I went round to the gaff
on Monday.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.880
I was going to have it out
with him but I'd had a few jars.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.360
Anyway, when I turned up,
I mean, he weren't there.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.080
But his son was outside and he
was getting a right pummelling

23:40.240 --> 23:41.560
from some other lad.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.280
Louis was being beaten up?

23:45.000 --> 23:46.440
If that's his name, then yeah.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.480
Could you describe this
other boy?

23:50.640 --> 23:55.120
Oh, he was black, same age,
same school uniform.

23:55.280 --> 23:57.320
Do you know what
they were fighting about?

23:57.480 --> 23:59.800
It seemed to be over some girl
who killed herself or something.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.560
It certainly makes more sense

24:05.720 --> 24:08.920
if Owen's Telford's comment
about a suicide earlier.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.680
Owen Telford's gone AWOL.
Not at school, not at home.

24:12.840 --> 24:14.600
School says he's got
60% attendance,

24:14.760 --> 24:18.280
frequent truant and in and out
of trouble with the staff there.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.520
I found a book of songs

24:19.680 --> 24:21.240
Louis Moretti
was writing in his room.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.320
One of them mentioned
a girl called Tara.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.760
I did some digging.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.560
Four days ago, a Tara Horwood
died by suicide.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.760
Post Mortem toxicology
pointed towards an overdose.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.080
Where was she found?

24:33.240 --> 24:35.080
In the bedroom
at her foster home.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.720
I've got details for her
foster parents

24:36.880 --> 24:40.280
and for her birth mother,
Nessa Horwood.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.320
Rob, take a closer look at
Tara's care history, will you?

24:43.480 --> 24:45.120
And Billie and I will track down
the mother.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.040
Rob?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.680
Yeah, I'm on it.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.520
[mellow music]

25:02.680 --> 25:05.120
[Vivienne]Thank you for
coming, Miss Horwood.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.640
-Nessa.
-Nessa.

25:07.800 --> 25:12.800
We're investigating
the murder of Louis Moretti.

25:12.960 --> 25:15.200
Never heard of him.

25:15.360 --> 25:17.960
Where were you this morning?

25:18.120 --> 25:21.720
I had a supervised visit
with my daughter Leah.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.320
And where was that?

25:23.480 --> 25:27.840
With a foster family
near Shadwell.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.280
They're never gonna
let her back with me.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.480
And my other girl's dead.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.680
[cries]

25:36.840 --> 25:40.160
I don't even have enough money
to bury her properly.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.840
You mean Tara.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.520
Are you sure Tara never
mentioned

25:46.680 --> 25:48.280
a boy called Louis Moretti?

25:51.800 --> 25:56.680
She was taken off me and
I hardly ever got to see her.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.880
They said she would be
better off without me.

26:00.560 --> 26:02.160
And then I lost her altogether.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.320
Tara Horwood was
in and out of foster care.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.360
The senior case worker
on the most recent proceedings

26:10.520 --> 26:12.360
where she and her baby sister
were removed

26:12.520 --> 26:14.960
from her mothers care
was Josie Moretti.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.480
Louis' mother.

26:16.640 --> 26:18.600
Apparently, Josie denied
knowing anyone called Tara

26:18.760 --> 26:20.240
when Billie questioned her.

26:20.400 --> 26:21.800
And why would she lie?

26:23.480 --> 26:24.440
Speak to the Morettis.

26:24.600 --> 26:26.920
Okay.

26:27.080 --> 26:28.960
[instrumental music]

26:42.400 --> 26:45.600
When they took the kids away
from Nessa

26:45.760 --> 26:50.080
it was easy finding somewhere
for Leah the baby to stay,

26:50.240 --> 26:53.560
but I couldn't find anywhere
for Tara that late at night.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.320
She looked so scared,
so vulnerable.

27:00.080 --> 27:04.080
I know I shouldn't have brought
her back to ours, but...

27:04.240 --> 27:05.840
well, I did,

27:07.880 --> 27:09.560
just for one night.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.360
So, you didn't know
she was staying over?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.960
I was away with work.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.400
I wish I hadn't been,

27:14.560 --> 27:17.160
I could have talked
some sense into her.

27:17.320 --> 27:20.680
Tara stayed the night,
then what?

27:20.840 --> 27:24.400
The next day I found her
somewhere to live.

27:24.560 --> 27:29.320
What I didn't realize was Tara
and Louis had really hit it off

27:29.480 --> 27:32.200
and, um, a month or so later

27:32.360 --> 27:34.920
I found
they were seeing each other.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.080
You know, in a relationship.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.480
[laughs]

27:37.640 --> 27:38.480
To think I've been
blaming myself--

27:38.640 --> 27:40.080
Please!

27:42.400 --> 27:45.040
Anyway...

27:45.200 --> 27:50.240
A few days back, Louis told me
she'd dumped him.

27:50.400 --> 27:53.640
I, I wasn't very
sympathetic to his...

27:53.800 --> 27:56.200
[cries]

27:56.360 --> 27:58.280
He was heartbroken.

28:03.560 --> 28:04.720
It would have been helpful

28:04.880 --> 28:05.920
if you hadn't of lied
to us earlier.

28:06.080 --> 28:07.160
I didn't want to admit.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.640
To being stupid?

28:08.800 --> 28:11.360
Mr. Moretti.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.560
No, he's right.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.320
I am stupid.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.200
[crying]
I didn't want to lose my job.

28:21.840 --> 28:24.360
[Josie continues crying]

28:30.400 --> 28:32.200
[music intensifies]

28:42.720 --> 28:44.480
Three images of Tara Horwood
naked were picked up

28:44.640 --> 28:47.280
by Louis' service provider.

28:47.440 --> 28:49.720
Those same images also
appeared on deleted posts

28:49.880 --> 28:52.920
on two of Louis'
social media accounts

28:53.080 --> 28:56.680
with some pretty ferocious
body shaming comments.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.760
[Vivienne]
Body shaming?

28:58.920 --> 29:01.920
Well, that's not the Louis
we thought we were dealing with.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.920
Well, it would explain why
she finished with him

29:04.080 --> 29:06.720
and then killed herself.

29:06.880 --> 29:10.040
But who would be angry enough
with Louis to want to kill him?

29:12.480 --> 29:15.240
Maybe Louis' friend
Owen Telford.

29:15.400 --> 29:16.600
I mean, maybe he had
a thing for her

29:16.760 --> 29:18.400
and was defending her honour.

29:18.560 --> 29:20.080
There's still no sign of him?

29:20.240 --> 29:22.160
Off the grid and his mobile
isn't on.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.880
Alright.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.760
Yeah, they've come through.

29:33.920 --> 29:35.720
See what your parents have
to see.

29:35.880 --> 29:37.320
Alright, cheers.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.280
These messages were posted
by Louis five days ago

29:44.440 --> 29:46.360
but with images attached.

29:46.520 --> 29:48.840
They were then deleted
the following day.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.320
No, no, he wouldn't do that.

29:52.480 --> 29:55.440
Stop it. He wouldn't, would he?

29:55.600 --> 29:58.080
[scoffs] I don't know
what I know anymore.

29:58.240 --> 30:00.520
How can you say that?

30:00.680 --> 30:03.320
They are talking about Louis,
our son.

30:03.480 --> 30:06.720
There's no way he would do that.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.120
He liked her,

30:09.280 --> 30:10.960
wrote songs about her.

30:14.360 --> 30:16.320
She's right.

30:16.480 --> 30:17.680
There's absolutely no way

30:17.840 --> 30:19.480
that Louis would do
anything like that.

30:19.640 --> 30:20.840
Is there any chance anyone else
could have had access

30:21.000 --> 30:26.080
to Louis phone on, uh...on
Sunday?

30:26.240 --> 30:29.840
Remember you and Louis
visited your sister's.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.000
Louis forgot his phone.
Kept moaning about it.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.720
And Owen came round here
for Louis

30:35.880 --> 30:37.360
and I said he could wait
in his room

30:37.520 --> 30:38.400
for him to come back.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.240
So, Owen had time?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.440
Plenty of time.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.400
I was annoyed with Louis.

30:43.560 --> 30:45.640
I couldn't believe how grumpy
he was being

30:45.800 --> 30:49.520
about not having his phone.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.640
It was Owen.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.840
It must have been.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.160
[music intensifies]

31:12.400 --> 31:15.280
Louis parents are 100% convinced
that he wasn't with his phone

31:15.440 --> 31:17.760
at the time
the body shaming post was sent.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.000
Owen Telford was.

31:20.160 --> 31:21.360
The phone that called Louis
at 8:23 this morning

31:21.520 --> 31:23.120
has just come live.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.600
Right, circulate Owen Telford
to local units and council CCTV

31:26.760 --> 31:28.840
and then head to
where the phone is being used.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.040
Fine.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.960
[intense music]

31:37.720 --> 31:40.120
Nessa Horwood.
Stop! Police!

31:49.480 --> 31:51.520
Police! Stop!

31:51.680 --> 31:55.680
Nessa! Stop! Police!

31:55.840 --> 31:59.320
Nessa! Out.

31:59.480 --> 32:01.320
Stop! Police!

32:01.480 --> 32:03.280
Stay there!

32:03.440 --> 32:04.840
Don't move.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.680
Nessa Horwood, I'm arresting you

32:08.840 --> 32:10.840
on suspicion of the murder
of Louis Moretti.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.960
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

32:13.120 --> 32:14.440
if you do not mention
when questioned

32:14.600 --> 32:16.840
something which you later
rely on in court.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.600
Anything you do say,
it may be given in evidence.

32:19.760 --> 32:22.440
My daughter's just died.
What is wrong with you?

32:25.840 --> 32:27.440
[mellow music]

32:38.320 --> 32:42.200
Nessa Horwood and her dealer
are being processed.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.640
Cheers.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.080
Is it normal what
the Chief Superintendent did?

32:48.240 --> 32:51.120
Telling me I've been promoted
like that?

32:51.280 --> 32:53.160
It's good.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.600
Don't look so worried.
You deserve it.

32:55.760 --> 32:57.080
[chuckles]

33:00.040 --> 33:01.720
What do you think of
the Chief Super?

33:04.000 --> 33:06.840
I hardly know the man.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.960
[intense music]

33:22.000 --> 33:23.000
[sighs]

33:23.160 --> 33:24.160
[knocks]

33:24.320 --> 33:26.120
[Chief Super]Come in.

33:28.760 --> 33:32.480
Detective Sergeant.
What can I do for you?

33:32.640 --> 33:35.160
I hear the Detective Inspector's
filled you in

33:35.320 --> 33:38.600
about Detective Constable Brady
being robbed last night.

33:38.760 --> 33:40.840
He did yes. Any progress?

33:41.000 --> 33:44.880
It's early days but
the concerning thing is

33:45.040 --> 33:48.480
that the suspect clearly
had been in Rob's home.

33:48.640 --> 33:51.560
He had a video
in his girl's bedrooms.

33:51.720 --> 33:54.520
So, he knew where Rob lived?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.240
Ah, this is awkward. I...

33:57.840 --> 33:59.560
I was checking the HR system

33:59.720 --> 34:02.760
and I noticed that you accessed
Rob's records yesterday?

34:05.520 --> 34:08.040
But yes, I mean as you know
I had concerns

34:08.200 --> 34:14.600
about DC Brady's behaviour
and so I accessed his records.

34:14.760 --> 34:16.280
[laughs]

34:16.440 --> 34:19.240
Am I being accused of
something here?

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
No, of course not.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.240
I'm just covering all the bases.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.960
Thank you for your time, sir.

34:32.160 --> 34:33.800
[door creaks]

34:38.440 --> 34:40.400
[music intensifies]

34:46.160 --> 34:48.160
We'll take it from here, thanks.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.360
Owen Telford's mum
has just dropped him downstairs.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.680
Apparently,
he has a confession to make.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.560
I told my mum what I did.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.360
She went nuts.

35:05.520 --> 35:09.000
Said if I didn't own up,
I'd end up in more trouble.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.440
Own up to what?

35:16.400 --> 35:19.320
Owen,
what did you tell your mum?

35:31.640 --> 35:33.280
I'm only telling you this

35:33.440 --> 35:36.600
so that you don't try and pin
anything else on me, yeah?

35:36.760 --> 35:39.360
Yeah.

35:39.520 --> 35:41.680
Tara.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.320
Louis was seeing her.

35:44.920 --> 35:48.160
He was obsessed.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.120
I don't see why,
she was a right skank.

35:50.280 --> 35:54.520
Yeah, rough as anything.

35:54.680 --> 35:56.920
I was just trying to look out
for him.

35:57.080 --> 35:58.080
That's what mates do.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.800
Yeah, get to the point.

36:01.680 --> 36:07.840
I found some gross photos
of her on his phone,

36:08.000 --> 36:09.240
posted onto his page

36:09.400 --> 36:10.760
and I said what everyone
was thinking.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.080
I did him a favour.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.760
It was just a laugh really.

36:16.920 --> 36:21.640
You posted naked pictures from
Louis' phone just for a laugh?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.560
Photos and body shaming comments

36:23.720 --> 36:25.760
that ultimately led to
a young girl killing herself.

36:25.920 --> 36:28.360
She might have been planning
on doing that anyway.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.680
Did Louis find out?

36:34.040 --> 36:35.640
Yeah.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.240
[David]How did he react?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.320
[scoffs]
He went for me.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.800
Look, it was a joke, yeah.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.440
Don't know what a joke is?

36:53.640 --> 36:56.280
Stop looking at me like that.

36:56.440 --> 36:58.360
It's not like I actually killed
anyone.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.640
[mellow music]

37:12.160 --> 37:14.600
We now know that you turned up
for your supervised visit

37:14.760 --> 37:17.720
with your other daughter
at 8:15 this morning,

37:17.880 --> 37:22.080
but you were turned away
for being intoxicated.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.720
No comment.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.440
I refer to exhibit BF12.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.960
This is the phone that I took
from your possession on arrest.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.960
Does it belong to you?

37:34.120 --> 37:35.920
No.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.040
A number of text messages
sent to this phone

37:38.200 --> 37:41.000
have the name Nessa
in their greeting.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.600
How do you explain that?

37:43.760 --> 37:45.840
It, it must belong to another
Nessa.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.480
[chuckles]

37:47.640 --> 37:50.680
So, a phone in your possession,
Nessa Horwood,

37:50.840 --> 37:52.520
belongs to someone else called
Nessa?

37:54.240 --> 37:56.400
Okay, yes, it's my phone.

37:56.560 --> 37:59.640
Why did you just lie?

37:59.800 --> 38:01.320
A call came from this phone

38:01.480 --> 38:06.160
to Louis Moretti
at 8:23 am this morning.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.000
Can you explain that?

38:09.160 --> 38:10.440
No comment.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.400
If you have
an innocent explanation

38:16.560 --> 38:18.600
I would like to hear it.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.160
[sighs]

38:22.240 --> 38:26.240
Tara used my phone
a few weeks back to call Louis.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.880
Hers was out of juice or
something.

38:30.040 --> 38:32.320
She was so happy.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.000
Happy as I've ever seen her.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.520
Said she really loved him.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.200
Anyway his, his number
was still on my phone

38:40.360 --> 38:41.680
from when she made that call.

38:43.680 --> 38:46.360
I just wanted to talk to him,
face-to-face.

38:46.520 --> 38:50.560
Ask him why he did what he did.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.440
Which was?

38:52.600 --> 38:56.000
Louis Moretti was the reason
Tara killed herself.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.880
Those horrible dirty pictures

38:58.040 --> 39:01.280
and all the nasty stuff
he said about her.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.200
So, you wanted to speak to
Louis in person.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.320
Did you?

39:07.480 --> 39:09.000
I met him in the park.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.680
I wanted him to see
what he'd done to me.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.920
To apologize.

39:16.080 --> 39:17.720
But he, he started saying
it wasn't him,

39:17.880 --> 39:19.200
it was his friend.

39:21.640 --> 39:22.920
But that's all that happened.

39:23.080 --> 39:24.320
[cries]

39:30.000 --> 39:33.680
Nessa, your flat has been
searched.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.600
Clothing and footwear
with blood stains were found.

39:38.520 --> 39:42.600
That blood is a match
for Louis Moretti.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.360
[sniffles]

39:52.720 --> 39:54.200
I was so angry.

39:57.360 --> 40:00.640
He started walking away from me
and...

40:00.800 --> 40:04.560
I picked up a brick or, or
a rock or something...

40:04.720 --> 40:07.360
and I hit him.

40:07.520 --> 40:09.600
And then what did you do?

40:11.160 --> 40:13.120
I panicked...

40:13.280 --> 40:15.120
[cries]

40:15.280 --> 40:19.040
and I dragged him
to the side of the water.

40:19.200 --> 40:20.760
Then I pushed him in.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.040
[sighs]

40:25.200 --> 40:26.760
[cries]

40:30.480 --> 40:31.880
We've got evidence to prove

40:32.040 --> 40:33.920
that Louis Moretti didn't post
the images of Tara

40:34.080 --> 40:35.280
on social media.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.240
One of his friends did.

40:40.920 --> 40:43.480
Apparently, Louis really liked
your daughter.

40:48.120 --> 40:50.520
I have to tell you, Nessa...

40:50.680 --> 40:52.440
you went after the wrong boy.

40:52.600 --> 40:54.080
[cries]

41:09.600 --> 41:10.760
[scoffs]

41:10.920 --> 41:12.960
So, Owen...

41:13.120 --> 41:18.880
your joke or helping out a mate
or whatever you wanna call it

41:19.040 --> 41:21.520
resulted in two deaths.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.000
Sorry, what?

41:23.160 --> 41:24.320
Well, it turns out that
it's thanks to you

41:24.480 --> 41:27.360
that Louis Moretti was killed.

41:27.520 --> 41:29.320
Do you still think that's funny?

41:32.080 --> 41:36.040
At last, something has made you
shut up and think.

41:39.000 --> 41:42.520
It's a pity Louis Moretti
had to die for that to happen.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.680
Owen Telford, I'm arresting you

41:44.840 --> 41:47.240
for distributing
indecent images.

41:47.400 --> 41:49.880
You do not have to say anything
but it may harm your defence

41:50.040 --> 41:51.640
if you do not mention
when questioned

41:51.800 --> 41:54.360
something which you later
rely on in court.

41:54.520 --> 41:57.480
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

41:57.640 --> 41:59.000
Do you understand?

42:04.800 --> 42:06.240
Do you really think the guy
who threatened my kids

42:06.400 --> 42:09.040
is a serving police officer?

42:09.200 --> 42:11.440
I'm sure of it.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.480
Night. Night, sir.

42:13.640 --> 42:17.080
Congratulations by the way,
Detective Constable.

42:17.240 --> 42:18.960
Thank you.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.400
You heading home?

42:20.560 --> 42:21.640
I've got a few things
to sort out

42:21.800 --> 42:23.440
but, um,
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:23.600 --> 42:26.520
Okay, bye.

42:26.680 --> 42:29.120
Detective Constable.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.200
I heard what happened
last night.

42:32.360 --> 42:35.640
I understand you want to protect
your family yourself.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.160
I respect that,

42:37.320 --> 42:39.360
but I want you to know that
if you change your mind,

42:39.520 --> 42:41.520
we're here for you.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.080
Thanks, sir.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.720
He's alright
once you get to know him.

42:53.880 --> 42:55.360
Do you think so?

42:58.840 --> 43:00.440
[mellow music]

43:07.000 --> 43:09.160
[music intensifies]

43:17.440 --> 43:19.520
Chief Superintendent Mulgrew
was the one

43:19.680 --> 43:22.960
that tipped off the killer
about you having that phone.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.240
What?

43:24.400 --> 43:28.560
And passed on your address.

43:28.720 --> 43:30.160
You've changed your tune.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.120
Well, I checked to see
if anyone had accessed

43:34.280 --> 43:37.720
Rob's HR details
and Mulgrew had.

43:37.880 --> 43:42.160
I spoke to him, I asked him why
and...

43:42.320 --> 43:43.600
and I looked him in the eye

43:43.760 --> 43:45.280
when he said
it was for Rob's welfare.

43:47.240 --> 43:48.600
He was lying.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.880
So, you now accept
he's involved in these murders?

43:52.040 --> 43:53.640
I do.

43:53.800 --> 43:57.360
And you're going to help us
bring these people to justice?

43:57.520 --> 43:59.080
I am.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.280
Well, how can you be so sure
the Chief Super was lying?

44:02.440 --> 44:06.480
Vivienne knows Mr. Mulgrew
very well.

44:08.120 --> 44:12.600
Uh, years ago,
and I mean years ago,

44:12.760 --> 44:14.920
me and
Chief Superintendent Mulgrew...

44:17.600 --> 44:19.000
What?

44:19.160 --> 44:21.720
We...we were together.

44:21.880 --> 44:24.560
Together?

44:24.720 --> 44:26.080
We were married.

44:26.240 --> 44:28.240
[intense music]

44:35.840 --> 44:37.640
[upbeat music]
