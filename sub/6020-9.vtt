WEBVTT

00:05.686 --> 00:08.870
Say me, you and Kramer
are flying over the Andes.

00:08.939 --> 00:10.616
Why are we flying over the Andes?

00:10.690 --> 00:13.993
We got a soccer game in Chile.
Anyway, the plane crashes.

00:14.068 --> 00:17.287
- Who are you gonna eat to survive?
- Kramer.

00:17.946 --> 00:21.166
- So fast? What about me?
- No.

00:22.033 --> 00:25.584
Kramer's so stringy. l'm plump, juicy.

00:25.661 --> 00:30.138
Kramer's got more muscle, higher
protein content. lt's better for you.

00:30.206 --> 00:34.386
- Well, l would eat you.
- That's very nice, l guess.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.801
Why wouldn't you eat me?
I'm your best friend.

00:36.879 --> 00:39.220
If other people are having some,
l'll try you.

00:39.297 --> 00:40.975
Thank you.

00:41.507 --> 00:43.896
- Can l have a piece of that?
- No.

00:50.431 --> 00:53.283
George, l can't have sex.

00:57.229 --> 00:59.866
With me, or in general?

01:00.565 --> 01:03.416
I went to the doctor today.
I have mono.

01:03.484 --> 01:05.410
Nucleosis?

01:05.485 --> 01:09.119
- I hope that's not a problem for you.
- No, no.

01:10.406 --> 01:14.337
So how long is this not gonna be
a problem for me?

01:16.536 --> 01:19.589
- Six weeks?
- Yeah, six weeks.

01:19.664 --> 01:21.803
So what?
You've gone six weeks before.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.262
I can do six weeks
standing on my head.

01:25.001 --> 01:28.351
I'm like a sexual camel.
That's not the point.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.643
At least there was the possibility.

01:30.714 --> 01:32.890
- You gonna break up with her?
- I don't know.

01:32.966 --> 01:35.354
- I don't wanna be one of those guys.
- What guys?

01:35.426 --> 01:37.519
Like us.

01:37.595 --> 01:40.612
- So it's just mono.
- Mono?

01:40.681 --> 01:42.856
Well, if anybody needs
any medical advice...

01:42.933 --> 01:47.112
Laney met a doctor,
and he's unattached.

01:47.186 --> 01:50.037
I thought the whole dream
of dating a doctor was debunked?

01:50.105 --> 01:53.704
No, it's not debunk. lt's totally bunk.

01:53.775 --> 01:56.365
Isn't bunk bad?
Like, "that's a lot of bunk"?

01:56.444 --> 01:58.583
No, something is bunk,
then you debunk it.

01:58.654 --> 02:01.126
- What?
- I think.

02:04.534 --> 02:09.591
Lookit. l'm dating a doctor, and l like it.
Let's just move on.

02:11.790 --> 02:13.384
- Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
- Jerry.

02:13.458 --> 02:16.262
Something came up for Tuesday
at the Dayton Civic Centre.

02:16.335 --> 02:19.803
- That's Ohio, Jerry.
- I've heard of Ohio, Katie...

02:19.880 --> 02:23.099
but Tuesday's no good.
I'm doing Career Day at my junior high.

02:23.216 --> 02:24.644
Okay, Jerry, that's fine.

02:24.717 --> 02:26.477
- All right.
- Katie works for Jerry.

02:26.552 --> 02:29.854
- Yes, all right, Katie. Thank you. Yes.
- Sorry for the late notice.

02:29.929 --> 02:31.821
- Bye. Bye.
- Okay, you're the...

02:34.808 --> 02:37.909
- They asked you to do Career Day?
- Yeah, it's no big thing.

02:37.978 --> 02:39.821
With all due respect, l went there too...

02:39.896 --> 02:42.154
and l work for a team that
just won the World Series.

02:42.231 --> 02:44.205
And you were integral.

02:51.072 --> 02:54.955
Jerry, so nice of you
to come down here.

02:55.033 --> 02:56.331
I'm on next, right?

02:56.409 --> 03:00.720
Well, unfortunately, Mr. Amiry,
from the Bronx Zoo....

03:00.788 --> 03:04.091
- The guy with the lizard?
- Yes.

03:04.166 --> 03:09.223
Well, he started feeding it crickets,
and the children just love him...

03:09.295 --> 03:11.019
and we're out of time.

03:13.215 --> 03:15.852
So can you come back tomorrow?

03:16.342 --> 03:21.150
I'm getting bumped?
You're bumping me from Career Day?

03:22.931 --> 03:26.815
So do most doctors like ER,
or do you guys just think it's fake?

03:26.893 --> 03:30.029
I couldn't tell you.
You know, l'm not really a doctor.

03:30.104 --> 03:31.995
Then l'm not really attracted you.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.659
I'm serious, Elaine.
I went to med school...

03:37.735 --> 03:40.788
but l still have to pass
my licensing exam.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.915
When do you take this exam?

03:42.989 --> 03:47.466
I've taken it three times.
I almost passed the last one.

03:47.535 --> 03:51.548
But you're basically a doctor.
I mean, people do call you doctor?

03:51.621 --> 03:54.473
- Well....
- Can l introduce you as doctor?

03:54.540 --> 03:57.427
- Yeah.
- All right. That's all l wanted to know.

03:59.503 --> 04:01.061
Mono.

04:03.420 --> 04:05.138
It was fantastic, Jerry.

04:05.216 --> 04:08.601
- We wound up talking all night.
- You're enjoying the not enjoying.

04:08.677 --> 04:13.189
You know, just by conversing, you can
really learn a lot about a person.

04:13.264 --> 04:14.941
I'm finding that out.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.861
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

04:16.934 --> 04:18.279
How was Career Day?

04:18.351 --> 04:21.950
I didn't get on.
The lizard guy went long.

04:22.563 --> 04:27.455
- You got bumped from Career Day?
- It was a mix-up, l'm sure.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.168
Sounds like they're trying to
screw with your head.

04:31.237 --> 04:35.204
Now, why would a junior high school
wanna screw with my head?

04:35.282 --> 04:37.754
Why does Radio Shack
ask for your phone number...

04:37.826 --> 04:40.167
when you buy batteries?

04:41.621 --> 04:43.547
I don't know.

04:45.999 --> 04:48.305
Hey, hey.
Kramer, what are you doing?

04:48.376 --> 04:51.097
- You can't smoke in here.
- Oh, go on.

04:51.170 --> 04:56.227
- Hey, take it outside.
- Come on, Larry. You know me.

04:56.299 --> 04:59.068
It bothers people,
and it's against the law.

04:59.135 --> 05:02.650
You can make all the laws you want.
He's still gonna bother people.

05:04.000 --> 05:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:11.520 --> 05:15.997
- What, did they kick you out too?
- Yeah, they kicked us all out.

05:17.361 --> 05:21.618
Thankssoch much  for coming back, Jerry.
Care for a Graham cracker?

05:21.695 --> 05:23.538
No, let's just do it.

05:24.030 --> 05:26.586
What? What is going on?
What is that about?

05:26.658 --> 05:30.624
Fire drill. Sorry.
Single file, everyone.

05:30.703 --> 05:34.420
- But l was promised a slot.
- Single file, Jerry.

05:41.753 --> 05:43.431
Fire drill. You believe that?

05:43.505 --> 05:46.475
- Who is Pericles?
- Pericles is correct.

05:46.549 --> 05:48.771
Like fire in a school
is such a big deal.

05:50.135 --> 05:52.311
- You got any matches?
- Middle drawer.

05:52.387 --> 05:54.396
Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?

05:54.472 --> 05:56.564
We were looking for
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.069
Thanks.

05:59.309 --> 06:01.200
- Hello. Oh, hi, Katie.
- Jerry.

06:01.269 --> 06:04.074
I heard what happened at the school.
They can't bump you.

06:04.147 --> 06:07.994
- That is so unprofessional.
- Oh, relax, Katie. lt's not a problem.

06:08.066 --> 06:10.242
- What is Borax?
- Yes, you are right.

06:10.318 --> 06:11.912
They bump you in junior high...

06:11.986 --> 06:15.455
next, you're being bumped in
high schools, colleges, trade schools.

06:15.531 --> 06:18.335
Before you know it,
Letterman won't return your calls.

06:18.825 --> 06:21.214
- You got an ashtray?
- I don't have any ashtrays.

06:21.286 --> 06:23.425
Cereal bowls.

06:23.496 --> 06:25.802
Jerry, don't freak out.
I'll take care of you.

06:25.873 --> 06:28.298
- Katie, don't...
- All right. Thanks.

06:29.209 --> 06:31.882
What is tungsten or wolfram?

06:39.801 --> 06:41.940
Is this a repeat?

06:42.011 --> 06:44.862
No, no, no. Just lately
l've been thinking a lot clearer.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.022
Like this afternoon...
What is chicken Kiev?

06:47.098 --> 06:51.445
I really enjoyed watching
a documentary with Louise.

06:51.519 --> 06:53.944
Louise. That's what's doing it.

06:54.855 --> 06:58.619
You're no longer preoccupied with sex,
so your mind is able to focus.

07:01.235 --> 07:04.419
- You think?
- Yeah. Let's say this is your brain.

07:04.488 --> 07:07.161
Okay?
Now, from what l know about you...

07:07.240 --> 07:09.830
your brain consists of two parts.

07:09.909 --> 07:12.678
The intellect, represented here...

07:14.412 --> 07:17.050
and the part obsessed with sex.

07:18.624 --> 07:19.755
Now, granted...

07:19.834 --> 07:24.429
you have extracted an astonishing
amount from this little scrap.

07:24.504 --> 07:28.850
But with no-sex Louise,
this previously useless lump...

07:28.924 --> 07:32.973
is now functioning
for the first time in its existence.

07:35.722 --> 07:37.481
Oh, my God.

07:37.556 --> 07:40.941
I just remembered where l left
my retainer in second grade.

07:41.018 --> 07:42.777
I'll see you later.

07:45.313 --> 07:49.279
- Hey, l need some more matches.
- What is going on in there?

07:49.358 --> 07:51.533
I met some people smoking
on the street...

07:51.610 --> 07:54.081
so l invited them
up to my apartment to smoke.

07:54.153 --> 07:57.088
- Why?
- Somebody had to.

07:57.156 --> 08:00.707
Just because a person's a smoker
doesn't mean he's not a human being.

08:00.784 --> 08:02.342
It doesn't?

08:02.410 --> 08:05.048
These people aren't gonna
let themselves be flicked...

08:05.121 --> 08:06.763
into the ashbin of society.

08:06.830 --> 08:09.255
- Why not?
- Well, you can confine them.

08:09.332 --> 08:12.137
You can punish them.
You can cram them into the corner...

08:12.210 --> 08:14.101
but they're not going away, Jerry.

08:15.254 --> 08:19.398
- All right.
- Yeah.

08:20.842 --> 08:22.649
When they hand out
those cadavers...

08:22.718 --> 08:24.775
do you choose if it's a man
or woman?

08:24.845 --> 08:27.945
I don't know.
Dead bodies really gross me out.

08:29.974 --> 08:32.030
- Oh, my God.
- What's wrong?

08:32.101 --> 08:36.447
Oh, it's Sue Ellen Mischke,
this old braless friend l hate.

08:36.897 --> 08:40.578
- Elaine? Hi.
- Oh, hi, Sue Ellen, hi.

08:40.691 --> 08:45.453
Oh, Rick, this is an old,
old friend of mine. Elaine Benes.

08:45.529 --> 08:49.044
Rick is a periodontist.
He does Giuliani's gums.

08:50.116 --> 08:52.789
Well, this is my boyfriend,
Dr. Ben Galvant.

08:52.868 --> 08:56.586
- Oh, well, l'm an intern.
- Hey, stop kidding, Ben.

08:58.498 --> 09:02.096
He's a doctor.
He's a very good doctor.

09:02.167 --> 09:05.351
Carlito's just passed out.
Can anyone help?

09:05.420 --> 09:09.469
- Oh, there's a doctor right here.
- No, there's not.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.771
Can't you at least tell them
what to do?

09:11.842 --> 09:14.479
- Like what?
- Shouldn't he elevate his legs?

09:14.761 --> 09:17.434
Right. Elevate your legs.

09:23.810 --> 09:26.697
I hope Carlito feels better.

09:26.771 --> 09:30.571
- Ben really wishes he could've helped.
- I thought he was a doctor.

09:30.649 --> 09:32.409
Oh, he is.

09:32.609 --> 09:34.618
You know, kind of.

09:35.111 --> 09:38.496
I mean, l call him doctor.

09:43.034 --> 09:44.711
George.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.421
Of course, absolute zero.

09:54.001 --> 09:57.801
- What? What is with all these books?
- I stopped having sex.

10:01.049 --> 10:03.770
All right. l'll see you, Phil.
I've got room for two...

10:03.843 --> 10:07.192
but the only thing l have
is in the non-filter section.

10:07.304 --> 10:08.649
Hey, hey, how you doing?

10:08.722 --> 10:10.898
What, you got
a smokers' lounge in there?

10:10.974 --> 10:13.695
Oh, yeah, people really seem
to be enjoying themselves.

10:13.768 --> 10:16.903
You know, they come in once,
it's like they're addicted.

10:17.938 --> 10:22.248
Jerry. Oh, there you are.
You didn't answer your phone.

10:22.316 --> 10:24.574
I was out.

10:24.652 --> 10:26.910
Jerry, great news.

10:26.987 --> 10:31.914
- I got you an assembly.
- An assembly?

10:32.408 --> 10:36.208
Two hours in front of the entire
junior high, grades six through eight.

10:36.286 --> 10:38.924
- That's sixth grade, seventh grade...
- I understand.

10:38.997 --> 10:41.670
But what am l gonna talk about
for two hours?

10:41.749 --> 10:45.893
And it is already in the school paper.
They cancelled Rick James.

10:46.211 --> 10:49.845
- "Super Freak"?
- Yes.

10:49.922 --> 10:52.857
What is your answer to number 74?

10:52.925 --> 10:56.725
- Metabolic acidosis.
- No.

10:56.803 --> 10:59.654
Hypokalemia.

10:59.889 --> 11:02.111
Not metabolic acidosis.

11:04.476 --> 11:07.149
Oh, man,
l'm never gonna pass this thing.

11:07.228 --> 11:11.277
Oh, yes, you are.
We'll just stop having sex.

11:12.858 --> 11:17.535
You guys. Hitting is not about muscle.
It's simple physics.

11:17.612 --> 11:20.878
Calculate the velocity, V,
in relation to the trajectory, T...

11:20.948 --> 11:24.214
in which, G, gravity, of course,
remains a constant.

11:28.954 --> 11:31.545
- It's not complicated.
- Now, who are you again?

11:31.623 --> 11:35.720
George Costanza,
assistant to the travelling secretary.

11:36.794 --> 11:40.179
Are you the guy who put us
in that Ramada in Milwaukee?

11:40.255 --> 11:43.309
You wanna talk about hotels,
or you wanna win some ball games?

11:43.383 --> 11:44.977
Hey, we won the World Series.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.816
In six games.

11:54.267 --> 11:57.616
So if you like to tell jokes,
and you love to make people laugh...

11:57.686 --> 12:01.320
stand-up comedy may be
the career for you.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.916
Thank you.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.706
Nine minutes.

12:13.866 --> 12:15.543
How am l gonna fill two hours?

12:15.617 --> 12:18.634
Hello? l could take an hour
off your hands.

12:18.703 --> 12:20.760
Let the kids see a real, live Yankee.

12:20.830 --> 12:23.966
And give you the chance to see
some real disappointed kids.

12:26.543 --> 12:28.137
Yes, l take your order, please?

12:28.211 --> 12:31.679
Excuse me, darling, do l...?
Do l detect a Portuguese accent?

12:40.304 --> 12:42.064
No, don't mention it.

12:43.223 --> 12:46.988
- Portuguese?
- Yeah, my cleaning lady is Portuguese.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.152
I must have picked it up.

12:49.228 --> 12:51.404
How come he's getting so smart?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.822
I stopped having sex with Ben
three days ago...

12:53.899 --> 12:56.406
and l don't know no Portuguese.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.337
- Are you all right?
- I don't know. l just...

13:02.406 --> 13:06.550
The last couple of days my mind
has been kind of, you know...

13:11.997 --> 13:14.136
not good.

13:14.207 --> 13:16.216
Wait a second.
I know what's happening.

13:16.292 --> 13:19.262
The no-sex thing is having
the reverse affect on you.

13:19.336 --> 13:21.642
What? What are you talking about?

13:21.713 --> 13:23.805
To a woman,
sex is like the garbage man.

13:23.882 --> 13:27.148
You take for granted that when
you put some trash on the street...

13:27.218 --> 13:30.271
a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna
come along and pick it up.

13:31.430 --> 13:35.112
But now, no sex,
it's like a garbage strike.

13:35.183 --> 13:39.280
The bags are piling up in your head.
The sidewalk is blocked.

13:39.353 --> 13:42.287
Nothing's getting through.
You're stupid.

13:42.355 --> 13:45.290
- I don't understand.
- Exactly.

13:51.696 --> 13:53.255
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

13:53.322 --> 13:56.458
Hey, you should come over.
Tonight's pipe night.

13:57.951 --> 14:00.720
- What happened to your face?
- What?

14:00.787 --> 14:03.757
It looks like an old catcher's mitt.

14:04.498 --> 14:06.057
What?

14:10.170 --> 14:15.855
Look at that.
My face is all craggily. lt's crinkly.

14:15.924 --> 14:17.898
It's from all that smoke.

14:17.968 --> 14:20.985
You've experienced a lifetime
of smoking in 72 hours.

14:21.054 --> 14:22.482
What did you expect?

14:22.888 --> 14:26.736
Emphysema, birth defects, cancer,
but not this.

14:28.018 --> 14:30.822
Jerry, you know,
my face is my livelihood.

14:33.647 --> 14:36.202
Everything l have l owe to this face.

14:36.274 --> 14:40.074
It's my allure, my twinkle, you know.

14:40.611 --> 14:43.415
You know, and your teeth,
your teeth are all brown.

14:45.657 --> 14:48.426
Look away, l'm... l'm hideous.

14:56.583 --> 15:00.845
Hey, Ben, l need a four-letter word.

15:00.919 --> 15:04.304
"Winnie-the-" blank.

15:04.381 --> 15:08.145
- Pooh.
- Poo.

15:11.470 --> 15:14.060
No, it's Winnie-the-Pooh.

15:19.351 --> 15:20.945
So the hospital called.

15:21.019 --> 15:24.203
Turns out some stupid intern
screwed up my test.

15:24.272 --> 15:26.697
I never had mono.

15:26.774 --> 15:30.705
So now we can, you know.

15:37.533 --> 15:38.961
So, what did you do?

15:39.034 --> 15:41.589
I told her
l would have to think about it.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.595
But ultimately you're gonna choose
in favour of sex, right?

15:46.123 --> 15:50.683
I don't know. Perhaps l can
better serve the world this way.

15:51.377 --> 15:54.976
You mean, not subjecting women
to your sexual advances?

15:56.632 --> 15:59.104
A simple joke from a simple man.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.686
So you're never gonna
have sex again?

16:02.762 --> 16:03.893
Well, Jerry...

16:03.971 --> 16:08.020
there was a pretty good chance l was
never gonna have sex again anyway.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.319
You ready for the assembly
and what you'll say about the Yankees?

16:11.894 --> 16:15.113
Sports are so pedestrian.
I prepared some science experiments...

16:15.189 --> 16:18.206
that will illuminate the mind
and dazzle the eye.

16:18.275 --> 16:22.074
I wrote a 20-minute bit about
how homework stinks.

16:23.988 --> 16:27.586
Oh, my vacation was restful,
resplendent, magnificent.

16:27.657 --> 16:30.212
In fact, next time l'm planning on
going to Corfu.

16:31.160 --> 16:32.505
Oh, no.

16:32.578 --> 16:34.255
- We gotta talk.
- No way, Kramer.

16:34.329 --> 16:37.513
You brought me only misfortune
and humiliation. Now, get out.

16:37.582 --> 16:39.425
- But, Jackie.
- I said, out.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.554
Jackie, l think l got a case
against the tobacco companies.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.220
- The who?
- The tobacco companies.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.898
I've been wanting a piece of them
for years.

17:09.400 --> 17:12.915
Did that cigarette label mention
any damage to your appearance?

17:12.986 --> 17:16.002
- No, no, it didn't say anything.
- So you were a victim...

17:16.071 --> 17:19.505
and now your face is
sallow, unattractive, disgusting.

17:20.492 --> 17:26.297
- So, Jackie, you think we got a case?
- Your face is my case.

17:34.045 --> 17:36.137
- Hey.
- Hey, how are you doing?

17:36.213 --> 17:38.886
Not good. l'm a moron.

17:39.800 --> 17:40.931
Don't worry about it.

17:41.009 --> 17:44.062
Once he passes the test,
you'll have sex and you'll be fine.

17:44.303 --> 17:47.523
Well, that kind of brings us
to why l'm here.

17:48.557 --> 17:50.815
You got 11 minutes?

17:52.268 --> 17:53.992
What for?

17:57.939 --> 17:59.450
Oh, come on.

17:59.524 --> 18:02.790
I just wanna clear my head.
It has nothing to do with you.

18:04.069 --> 18:06.956
I think it has something to do
with me.

18:07.030 --> 18:11.079
You could read the paper
through the whole thing, if you want.

18:12.827 --> 18:16.971
No, no, no. l'm sorry.
This is too weird.

18:17.706 --> 18:20.047
All right.

18:20.124 --> 18:22.300
Is Kramer home?

18:25.337 --> 18:27.892
You know, Louise,
l think you'll find this amusing.

18:27.964 --> 18:32.772
- In early Euclidean geometry they...
- George, l have to have sex.

18:32.843 --> 18:34.900
I used to share
that very same outlook...

18:34.970 --> 18:37.477
but now l have so many things
to occupy my mind.

18:37.555 --> 18:41.154
- For instance, the atom.
- Goodbye, George.

18:41.225 --> 18:43.483
I hate you.

18:45.312 --> 18:47.867
Fascinating turn of events.

18:54.069 --> 18:58.166
Ms. Wilkie, your tobacco company
has turned this beautiful specimen...

18:58.239 --> 19:01.256
into a horrible, twisted freak.

19:02.868 --> 19:04.296
Who could love me?

19:06.537 --> 19:12.971
I disagree. ln fact, l feel Mr. Kramer
projects a rugged masculinity.

19:16.504 --> 19:19.557
Rugged? The man's a goblin.

19:19.631 --> 19:21.889
He's only been exposed to smoke
for four days.

19:21.967 --> 19:25.980
By the time this case gets to trial, he'll
be nothing more than a shrunken head.

19:27.596 --> 19:31.230
All right, Mr. Chiles,
you'll have our offer by tomorrow.

19:31.308 --> 19:34.278
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Yeah, bye-bye.

19:34.644 --> 19:38.112
Jackie. Jackie, you did it.
We're rich.

19:38.188 --> 19:42.202
You better believe it. Jackie's cashing
in on your wretched disfigurement.

19:45.486 --> 19:48.705
Congratulations! You passed.

19:48.780 --> 19:52.498
Elaine, Elaine, l don't think
we should see each other anymore.

19:52.742 --> 19:54.917
What?
You're breaking me up with me?

19:54.994 --> 19:59.304
But l sacrificed and supported you
while you struggled.

19:59.831 --> 20:02.303
What about my dream
of dating a doctor?

20:02.375 --> 20:05.677
I'm sorry, Elaine. l always knew
that after l became a doctor...

20:05.752 --> 20:08.687
l would dump whoever l was with
and find someone better.

20:08.755 --> 20:12.354
That's the dream
of becoming a doctor.

20:13.175 --> 20:16.441
Lookit.
Are we gonna have sex or not?

20:18.847 --> 20:22.315
Jerry, when the glee club's finished
singing, George goes on, then you.

20:22.391 --> 20:25.859
- Hey.
- Where have you been? You're on next.

20:25.936 --> 20:27.530
I got lost on the way over.

20:27.604 --> 20:31.914
Got lost? We went to school here
for three years.

20:32.358 --> 20:36.834
What are these?
Take me to your leader.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.215
Oh, my God, you had sex.

20:43.450 --> 20:48.756
- You had sex with Louise.
- No, the Portuguese waitress.

20:48.829 --> 20:50.720
The Portuguese waitress?

20:50.789 --> 20:53.676
I calculated my odds
of ever getting together...

20:53.750 --> 20:57.894
with a Portuguese waitress.
Mathematically, l had to do it, Jerry.

20:57.962 --> 20:59.342
George, George, you're on.

20:59.421 --> 21:02.522
- Oh, l'm not going on.
- What did you come down here for?

21:02.591 --> 21:05.312
To tell you
about the Portuguese waitress.

21:06.052 --> 21:07.895
It's good to have you back.

21:07.970 --> 21:12.316
- One of you has to go on.
- All right. l'll do it.

21:14.976 --> 21:18.112
Hey, kids,
what's the deal with homework?

21:18.187 --> 21:20.659
You're not working on your home.

21:24.734 --> 21:27.122
That was a great lunch, Jackie.
Thanks.

21:27.194 --> 21:29.582
It's puzzling we haven't
gotten that offer yet.

21:29.821 --> 21:32.756
Well, Mrs. Wilkie
from the tobacco company called me.

21:32.824 --> 21:34.252
And we had a little powwow.

21:34.325 --> 21:36.417
A powwow?
Who told you to have a powwow?

21:36.493 --> 21:38.835
I didn't tell you to have a powwow.

21:38.912 --> 21:41.384
- She made an offer. l took it.
- How much?

21:41.456 --> 21:44.889
- No, no, no. There was no money.
- No money? Then, what did we get?

21:46.752 --> 21:48.643
Check it out.

21:52.757 --> 21:56.272
This is the most public yet
of my many humiliations.

22:03.724 --> 22:07.074
Cancelled? But l was supposed to
be on tomorrow night.

22:07.144 --> 22:09.816
Yeah, but then,
some people were telling me about...

22:09.896 --> 22:13.660
that little flap out there
at the junior high school assembly.

22:15.233 --> 22:18.749
And before that,
you were bumped by a lizard?

22:19.737 --> 22:22.126
It was a...
Actually, it was a monitor lizard.

22:22.198 --> 22:24.373
Those things, deadly, dangerous.

22:24.449 --> 22:28.333
A long time ago, my uncle and a date
are driving, like, through Mexico.

22:28.411 --> 22:29.886
They see one on the road.

22:29.954 --> 22:32.426
Drags him out of the car
and chews his face off.

22:32.790 --> 22:35.724
Listen. We'll call you if anything
opens up. Okay, Jimmy?

22:35.792 --> 22:38.383
- Jerry.
- Right. Jerry.
