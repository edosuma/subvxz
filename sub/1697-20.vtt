00:13.710 --> 00:14.860
Loser.

00:15.870 --> 00:17.590
How do you do that?

00:17.670 --> 00:19.350
Lungs of a singer, baby.

00:19.430 --> 00:23.390
Which means
Mamaw sleeps in your room.

00:23.790 --> 00:27.630
But this isn't fair. Why should l
have to give up my room?

00:27.710 --> 00:31.990
Because you've got the lungs
of a loser.

00:33.030 --> 00:36.500
But she wouldn't even be coming here
if it wasn't for your stupid award.

00:36.590 --> 00:40.670
An lnternational Music Award is like
winning an Oscar.

00:40.750 --> 00:43.870
lf it was a stupid award,
you'd win brains down.

00:46.270 --> 00:49.190
Man, this is really gonna mess up
your back.

00:52.190 --> 00:55.190
Well, careful with that box, Robby Ray.

00:58.310 --> 01:02.390
That's got my fancy wig.
l only air it out for parties and funerals.

01:02.470 --> 01:03.510
Sorry, Mom.

01:03.590 --> 01:05.790
And l can't believe you had
the music on so loud in the car.

01:05.870 --> 01:07.670
You didn't hear a word
that l was saying.

01:07.750 --> 01:10.790
Really?
What in the world was l thinking?

01:10.870 --> 01:12.190
Well, you missed my whole story

01:12.270 --> 01:14.580
about that big old hairy mole
that l had found on my...

01:14.670 --> 01:15.790
Kids!

01:17.110 --> 01:19.070
Say hello to your grandma. Quick.

01:19.150 --> 01:20.950
-Mamaw!
-Mamaw!

01:21.030 --> 01:22.070
There they are.

01:22.150 --> 01:25.780
My handsome grandson
and my beautiful granddaughter,

01:25.870 --> 01:27.590
the youngest person ever to win

01:27.670 --> 01:31.710
the lnternational Music Awards
Female Artist of the Year.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.190
By word, that is a mouthful.

01:35.270 --> 01:38.230
No wonder
those award shows are always so long.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.430
Hey, hey, you know what else is long?

01:41.510 --> 01:44.820
The walk from my bedroom
to the bathroom.

01:44.910 --> 01:48.140
Miley's is right next door,
and it has a view of the ocean.

01:48.230 --> 01:50.380
See dolphins in the morning.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.220
Would you give it a rest?
She's in your room.

01:55.310 --> 01:58.700
Mamaw, Sunday is gonna be perfect.

01:58.790 --> 02:01.430
l am getting an award
l've always dreamed of,

02:01.510 --> 02:04.630
Daddy's presenting it to me
and now everyone l love is here.

02:04.710 --> 02:06.830
You, Aunt Dolly...

02:09.310 --> 02:11.510
Back this tractor-trailer up.

02:12.150 --> 02:14.060
You mean to tell me that bottle-blonde,

02:14.150 --> 02:17.460
shrink-wrapped, five pounds of baloney
in a three-pound bag...

02:17.550 --> 02:19.830
Now, Momma,
l know you don't like her, but...

02:19.910 --> 02:23.620
Son, it is not just her butt l don't like.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.910
lt's her head, her toes
and everything in between.

02:28.270 --> 02:31.630
Mamaw, this is the biggest award
of my life.

02:31.710 --> 02:35.020
Can't you guys just get along
for a weekend? Please, Mamaw?

02:35.110 --> 02:37.580
Sweetie, l guess for your sake,
l can look the other way,

02:37.670 --> 02:41.750
and l do mean the other way.
l don't even want to see that woman.

02:41.830 --> 02:43.190
That might be kind of hard.

02:43.270 --> 02:45.390
Why? We don't have to pick her up
at her hotel, do we?

02:45.470 --> 02:49.310
Can't she just hitch a ride
on one of her flying monkeys?

02:49.390 --> 02:53.310
We don't have to pick her up, Mamaw,
'cause she's staying here.

02:54.190 --> 02:56.710
Award-winning granddaughter
say what?

02:57.670 --> 02:58.740
Hey.

03:01.790 --> 03:04.350
l can see dolphins from my guest room.

03:04.430 --> 03:05.950
Well, shoot, that's nothing.

03:06.030 --> 03:10.070
There's a snot-green blowfish
right here in the living room.

03:10.150 --> 03:13.700
Now, Ruthie, if you're gonna be mean,
talk to the booty

03:13.790 --> 03:15.860
'cause the hand's off duty.

03:16.710 --> 03:17.940
Well, l would love to,

03:18.030 --> 03:20.750
but that booty has been nipped
and tucked so many times,

03:20.830 --> 03:23.110
l just can't hardly find it.

03:23.990 --> 03:27.430
Well, l ain't having no problem
finding yours.

03:28.550 --> 03:32.180
Family! So glad to have you here.

03:32.710 --> 03:34.910
Good times, good times. Yeah.

03:40.630 --> 03:42.190

03:42.270 --> 03:44.660

04:21.190 --> 04:24.500
<i>And you know tha</i> t
<i>it's the best of both world</i> s

04:28.670 --> 04:30.980
So, this whole feud started over a boy?

04:31.070 --> 04:33.270
Yep. lt was high school.

04:33.350 --> 04:35.550
Mamaw was having
a summer romance,

04:35.630 --> 04:38.270
and then Aunt Dolly bounced in and...

04:38.350 --> 04:41.150
Well, that was pretty much
all she had to do.

04:41.590 --> 04:46.990
Mamaw never forgave Dolly for stealing
the love of her life, Mr Elvis Presley.

04:48.190 --> 04:49.260
-No!
-Yes!

04:49.350 --> 04:50.390
-No!
-Yes!

04:50.470 --> 04:52.430
-No!
-Yes!

04:53.150 --> 04:54.790
Yes! Yes! Elvis.

04:54.870 --> 04:59.630
Elvis with the pelvis and the hair
and the ''hunk, a hunk of burning love.''

04:59.710 --> 05:03.870
Guys, l haven't slept all night,
and my back is killing me, so, please,

05:03.950 --> 05:08.340
for the love of all that is good
and pure in this forsaken universe,

05:08.430 --> 05:09.630
zip it!

05:11.470 --> 05:13.270
Good morning, everybody.

05:13.350 --> 05:18.430
Well, Jackson, you lazy bones,
get your rump out of bed.

05:20.870 --> 05:22.190
Well, what do you know?

05:22.270 --> 05:24.950
Floor's more comfortable
than the couch.

05:27.150 --> 05:30.150
-Morning, Mamaw Stewart.
-Hey, Lilly, you cutie-patootie.

05:30.230 --> 05:34.350
lt's too bad Dolly isn't here
to see what a real blonde looks like.

05:35.390 --> 05:38.620
-Mamaw...
-l'm sorry. l'll chillax.

05:40.150 --> 05:41.910
What?
l'm Hannah Montana's grandma.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.300
l gotta keep up on the teen scene
so l can be fricky-fricky fresh.

05:47.030 --> 05:49.230
Okay, now that is
just wicky-wicky weird.

05:50.390 --> 05:52.990
Hey, Mamaw, come here.
Will you look at my nails?

05:53.070 --> 05:57.670
What should l do for the awards show?
Sparkly or non-sparkly?

05:57.750 --> 06:01.950
l think non-sparkly.
Sparkly just kind of feels trampy.

06:02.030 --> 06:04.750
Hey, look at my sparkly nails.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.470
Just had them done
for the awards show.

06:08.550 --> 06:09.870
Exhibit A.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.470
Come on, Mamaw.

06:16.230 --> 06:19.990
Now, you promised you'd be nice.
Aunt Dolly's being nice.

06:20.070 --> 06:22.750
Well, of course. l'm always nice.

06:22.830 --> 06:25.830
At least that's what
the King used to tell me.

06:27.670 --> 06:29.740
You know l gave Elvis that nickname.

06:29.830 --> 06:33.190
We used to always play checkers,
and he would be like, ''King me, baby.''

06:33.270 --> 06:35.990
So l started calling him the King.
True story.

06:36.070 --> 06:40.190
Now, Ruthie, there's no need
to get your granny panties in a twist.

06:41.310 --> 06:44.910
Why don't you come on over here?
l'll give yours a twist.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.980
Your family's better than cable.

06:49.110 --> 06:50.790
Pull your claws in, Miss Kitty.

06:50.870 --> 06:53.750
l'm just here to celebrate
my goddaughter's big night.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.750
And l am here to celebrate
my granddaughter's big night.

06:56.830 --> 07:01.830
That is my granddaughter,
my kinfolk, a blood relation.

07:03.390 --> 07:04.670
Now, l'm just gonna run
and get my purse.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.580
Then l'm gonna take you
to find something beautiful

07:06.670 --> 07:07.950
to wear for your awards show.

07:08.030 --> 07:09.350
How sweet.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.220
Don't worry, darling,
l'll take you shopping later,

07:12.310 --> 07:16.150
and l'll buy you something
you'll actually want to be seen in.

07:21.070 --> 07:24.860
Rico's public access commercial,
take one.

07:24.950 --> 07:26.470
And action.

07:29.550 --> 07:34.910
Hey-o. My name is Rico.
And this is Rico's.

07:35.710 --> 07:40.310
Do you like hot dogs?
We've got hot dogs. Do you like...

07:40.390 --> 07:41.670
Cut! Cut!

07:43.030 --> 07:46.630
Okay, maybe l was a little nervous.

07:46.710 --> 07:50.630
lt was my first take. l'll loosen up.
Just give me a minute.

07:50.710 --> 07:53.100
Hey-o, l'm Rico! Hey-o, l'm Rico!

07:54.990 --> 07:56.590
Okay, l'm good.

07:56.670 --> 07:59.950
Rico's public access commercial,
take two.

08:00.030 --> 08:01.590
And action.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.550
Hey-o. My name is Rico, and...

08:08.630 --> 08:09.910
Cut! Cut!

08:11.070 --> 08:12.390
Stupid. Stupid.

08:12.470 --> 08:15.590
No, you're not stupid.
You just can't act.

08:18.550 --> 08:21.990
Face it, Rico. We need a better Rico.

08:24.790 --> 08:25.910
Fine.

08:27.070 --> 08:28.140
Who's first?

08:28.230 --> 08:30.750
-Hey-o! Hey-o! Hey-o!
-Hey-o! Hey-o! Hey-o!

08:34.470 --> 08:36.270
Okay, open your eyes.

08:36.990 --> 08:39.710
Wow, your mamaw has better taste
than l thought.

08:39.789 --> 08:44.340
Aunt Dolly bought me this.
Mamaw bought me this.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.310
Wait for it.

08:58.110 --> 08:59.510
With lights!

09:02.190 --> 09:04.990
l thought having both of them here
would make this night perfect,

09:05.070 --> 09:06.590
but now,
l just can't wait for it to be over.

09:06.670 --> 09:08.430
What am l gonna do?

09:08.510 --> 09:11.110
Well, too bad you can't just put them
in front of a mirror

09:11.190 --> 09:13.870
and show them
how ridiculous they look.

09:13.950 --> 09:15.430
Wait a minute.

09:19.830 --> 09:21.310
l got an idea.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.190
Okay, that was weird.

09:31.590 --> 09:34.030
-E-7.
-Miss. Again.

09:35.150 --> 09:38.190
-A-2.
-Hit. Again.

09:39.030 --> 09:42.870
Dang it, woman, l'm your son.
Doesn't that account for anything?

09:42.950 --> 09:43.990
No.

09:45.070 --> 09:47.300
Excuse me, l'm a little hungry,

09:47.390 --> 09:51.550
but l was just wondering if l should
eat this apple before lunch?

09:53.870 --> 09:55.990
-B-4?
-Hit.

09:57.710 --> 10:00.350
-A-3.
-Miss.

10:01.950 --> 10:05.100
Excuse me, could you tell me
where l might find a napkin?

10:05.190 --> 10:07.100
'Cause l don't see one.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.100
All right, l will tell you what l see.

10:10.190 --> 10:13.110
The woman who put the old
in the <i>Grand Ole Opry</i>.

10:13.190 --> 10:16.110
-You sank my submarine.
-He did that.

10:16.190 --> 10:18.710
Crying out loud,
he couldn't beat me at tiddlywinks.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.620
Let that live forever.

10:21.390 --> 10:22.870
Don't you walk away from me,

10:22.950 --> 10:25.830
you shrink-wrapped,
rhinestone hillbilly.

10:29.590 --> 10:32.630
Let it go, you sour old prune.

10:33.830 --> 10:37.540
You are just mad
'cause Elvis chose me.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.300
He didn't choose you. You stole him,

10:41.390 --> 10:44.590
you big-haired,
two-timing yackity-yodeller!

10:44.670 --> 10:48.430
Well, l'd rather have big hair
than a double-wide backside.

10:48.510 --> 10:52.630
Well, at least l don't have
a triple-wide ego and a mouth to match.

10:54.350 --> 10:57.660
Ladies, please, you're all shook up.

10:59.390 --> 11:00.590
Don't be cruel.

11:00.670 --> 11:05.220
You gotta take all that anger
and return to sender, baby.

11:08.030 --> 11:11.990
Elvis, didn't you love me the most?

11:12.070 --> 11:13.710
Well, pretty mamas,
when it comes down to it,

11:13.790 --> 11:17.750
l would've traded you both for a fried
peanut butter and banana sandwich.

11:17.830 --> 11:22.700
So you mean to tell me we've been
fighting all these years for nothing?

11:24.430 --> 11:27.630
And forgetting
that we both married wonderful men?

11:31.190 --> 11:35.350
And we should just stop arguing
and celebrate Miley's big night?

11:35.430 --> 11:36.790
Yeah, yeah.

11:37.950 --> 11:40.710
l believe it's your turn now, ladies.

11:40.790 --> 11:43.070
Well, don't that beat all.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.220
Well, don't l feel foolish.

11:45.310 --> 11:47.380
How come l never thought
of ''yackity-yodeller''?

11:47.470 --> 11:49.230
That one's a keeper.

11:50.670 --> 11:51.950
l'm gonna do you a favour.

11:52.030 --> 11:54.260
l'm gonna pretend
like l didn't hear that.

11:54.350 --> 11:56.870
Kind of like you've been pretending
for the past 30 years

11:56.950 --> 11:59.020
that that's your real hair?

11:59.950 --> 12:03.580
You wanna dance, mamaw?
Well, bring on the music.

12:03.670 --> 12:06.670
-Bring it on, blondie.
-You just...

12:06.750 --> 12:08.710
Okay, stop it.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.670
l love you both,

12:10.750 --> 12:14.060
but l guess you don't love me enough
to stop this.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.310
And if this is how you're gonna act,

12:18.390 --> 12:21.540
l don't want either of you guys
there tonight.

12:21.630 --> 12:26.580
ln fact,
why don't you both just go home?

12:37.190 --> 12:40.790
Sweetie, could we talk to you
for just a minute?

12:40.870 --> 12:41.940
Why?

12:42.030 --> 12:45.820
Well, because you really
are important to us, angel.

12:45.910 --> 12:47.870
And if you'll let us
come to the awards show,

12:47.950 --> 12:49.180
we promise to behave.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.710
We really will.

12:50.790 --> 12:53.790
Why should l believe anything
y'all say?

12:53.870 --> 12:55.830
Well, we'll prove it to you.

12:55.910 --> 12:58.870
Ruthie, does this outfit
make me look trampy?

13:03.190 --> 13:04.910
No, not at all.

13:04.990 --> 13:06.110
Wait a minute, l can do better than that.

13:06.190 --> 13:07.790
Mamaw, it's okay.

13:09.790 --> 13:13.100
You're trying.
That is all l've ever wanted.

13:13.190 --> 13:16.340
-So, we can come?
-lt would mean the world to us.

13:17.470 --> 13:20.470
Fine, but l'm picking out my own outfit.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.030
-But...
-But...

13:22.830 --> 13:24.230
-Okay.
-Okay.

13:29.150 --> 13:34.830
Hey-o! My name is Rico.
And this is Rico's.

13:34.910 --> 13:36.350
Do you like hot dogs?

13:36.430 --> 13:38.190
Well, we've got the best hot dogs
in town.

13:38.270 --> 13:40.150
Perfect! He's great!

13:40.830 --> 13:42.550
l'm not feeling it.

13:45.790 --> 13:47.670
He doesn't have the right look.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.510
Are you kidding?
He could be your brother.

13:49.590 --> 13:51.150
l am his brother.

13:53.390 --> 13:55.540
Now that's a Rico.

13:56.550 --> 13:58.030
ln what world?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.430
Let's just see what he's got.

14:00.510 --> 14:04.470
Whenever you're ready, beautiful.
lt's like looking in a mirror.

14:11.270 --> 14:13.710
Hey-o, my name's Rico.

14:16.270 --> 14:19.270
Okay, l know how to fix this.

14:21.550 --> 14:25.750
<i>l'm Rico. And l'll be waiting for you</i>.
<i>Hey-o</i>!

14:31.590 --> 14:34.030
l am ashamed to be a part of this.

14:35.190 --> 14:39.350
Nothing sells hot dogs
like some sweet relish.

14:46.190 --> 14:47.630
Okay, Daddy, now remember,

14:47.710 --> 14:50.990
when you introduce me,
it is not about you.

14:51.470 --> 14:53.910
You get on and get right back off.

14:55.230 --> 14:56.590
Just for that, l'm gonna tell them

14:56.670 --> 14:58.710
how you used to put that diaper
on your head

14:58.790 --> 14:59.860
and run around the house.

14:59.950 --> 15:04.150
''Captain Diaperhead.''
They're gonna love that.

15:04.230 --> 15:08.310
That is exactly why l brought pictures
of you in your chubby years.

15:08.390 --> 15:12.070
Fine.
Captain Diaperhead triumphs again.

15:12.150 --> 15:15.270
<i>Now presenting the awar</i> d
<i>for Female Artist of the Year</i>,

15:15.350 --> 15:18.980
<i>award-winning singer and songwriter</i>,
<i>Robby Ray</i>.

15:19.070 --> 15:20.900
Hey, you guys might want
to go take your seats now.

15:20.990 --> 15:22.190
No, l'm fine right here.

15:22.270 --> 15:25.150
l wanna be the first one to hug you
when you come off that stage.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.460
Well, l wanted to be
the only one wearing pink, too,

15:27.550 --> 15:30.510
so it looks like we're both gonna
be disappointed.

15:31.510 --> 15:33.390
Well, we'll hug her together.

15:33.470 --> 15:35.110
What a nice idea.

15:37.230 --> 15:38.870
l'm watching you.

15:41.550 --> 15:46.100
<i>Fifteen years ago, l was lucky enoug</i> h
<i>to win Artist of the Year</i>,

15:46.190 --> 15:50.310

<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>,

15:56.670 --> 15:58.150
Thanks, Daddy.

16:00.470 --> 16:03.860
<i>l couldn't have aske</i> d
<i>for a better introduction</i>.

16:03.950 --> 16:06.590
<i>l have to say that. He's my ride home</i>.

16:07.950 --> 16:10.750
You know that girl has such
a wonderful sense of humour.

16:10.830 --> 16:13.300
She got that from my side of the family.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.540
Really?

16:14.630 --> 16:17.190
l always thought she learned how
to get a chuckle out of an audience

16:17.270 --> 16:19.310
from watching me on stage.

16:20.830 --> 16:25.950
''Watching me on stage.
Me, me, me, me, me.''

16:26.870 --> 16:29.510
<i>This is such an incredible honour</i>,

16:29.590 --> 16:33.190
<i>and getting it from my da</i> d
<i>makes it all the more special</i>.

16:35.270 --> 16:38.500
You know, actually, l never really
thought you were all that funny.

16:38.590 --> 16:41.870
Well, Elvis thought
l had a wonderful comic mind.

16:41.950 --> 16:43.940
l know what Elvis was thinking about

16:44.030 --> 16:46.670
and, honey, trust me,
it had nothing to do with your mind.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.140
-You take that back.
-You make me.

16:51.230 --> 16:55.430
<i>And what makes this night perfec</i> t
<i>is l can share it with the two wome</i> n

16:55.510 --> 17:00.510

<i>character, strength, and, of course..</i>.

17:00.590 --> 17:03.060
-Man-stealer!
-Sore loser!

<i>...their class</i>.

17:10.790 --> 17:14.470

17:21.670 --> 17:25.589
<i>l remember when l got my first review</i>.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.350
<i>They both cut it out and sent it to me</i>.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.390
<i>They sent me so many clippings</i>,

17:37.470 --> 17:39.380
<i>l finally just had to say..</i>.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.030
Enough already!

17:44.230 --> 17:45.950
<i>l'll be right back</i>.

17:48.190 --> 17:51.190
Jackson, l leave the room for two
minutes and you turn on wrestling.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.470
Flip back to the awards show.

17:54.190 --> 17:56.150
This is the awards show.

18:00.550 --> 18:02.670
That's gonna leave a mark.

18:03.390 --> 18:05.070
You guys promised.

18:09.670 --> 18:12.270
Now, break it up.

18:16.510 --> 18:19.870
Wow.
Your family really is better than cable.

18:23.670 --> 18:28.750
<i>Once again, l would just like t</i> o
<i>thank you so much for this award</i>.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.910
<i>l mean, this award</i>.

18:33.950 --> 18:37.260
<i>Sweet niblets</i>.
<i>l hope you two are happy</i>.

18:39.830 --> 18:41.660
<i>Good night, everybody</i>!

18:48.910 --> 18:52.300
Miley, slow down. l think l broke a heel.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.750
Yeah, well, l think l broke a hip.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.900
Will you two stop it?

18:56.990 --> 19:00.110
You turned
one of the best nights of my life

19:00.190 --> 19:03.870
into some kind of granny smackdown.

19:03.950 --> 19:08.390
Miley, sweetie, how many times
do we have to say we're sorry?

19:09.430 --> 19:12.110
You can say
you're sorry a million times,

19:12.190 --> 19:14.630
but l will never forgive you.

19:14.710 --> 19:16.860
l learned that from the best.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.350
Mile?

19:25.430 --> 19:27.070
Great night, huh?

19:30.350 --> 19:32.230
Hey, listen, darling...

19:32.310 --> 19:36.860
Dad, don't ask me to go out there
and forgive them 'cause l won't.

19:37.230 --> 19:38.430
l don't blame you.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.870
l think those women
actually dislocated my shoulder.

19:42.590 --> 19:45.060
l wouldn't blame you
if you never spoke to them again.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.430
Good, 'cause l'm not.

19:47.510 --> 19:48.550
Good for you.

19:48.630 --> 19:52.590
Why should you treat them any
different than they treat each other?

19:52.670 --> 19:54.430
Where are you going with this?

19:54.510 --> 19:59.790
Well, wherever your heart tells you
l'm going. Think about it.

20:03.310 --> 20:06.270
l hate when he goes
all fortune cookie on me.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.740
l'll put your luggage in the car.

20:13.510 --> 20:16.390
Gee, l wonder
what's wrong with my shoulder.

20:16.750 --> 20:20.110
That's right. l was body-slammed
into the stage door.

20:21.150 --> 20:23.620
-Sorry about that.
-My bad, sweetie.

20:26.830 --> 20:30.430
-Well, l guess she's not coming down.
-l don't blame her.

20:33.070 --> 20:35.710
Hey, don't go yet.

20:41.230 --> 20:44.070
l'm still incredibly mad at you.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.950
-l don't blame you, sweetie.
-Me, neither.

20:47.030 --> 20:51.270
But that doesn't mean
l'll never forgive you.

20:52.590 --> 20:55.310
Because if l don't, l lose you,

20:56.710 --> 20:59.180
and l've seen what that looks like.

20:59.550 --> 21:05.470
So you all can go on hating each other,
but l'll never hate you.

21:07.870 --> 21:09.700
l don't think the two most
important women in my life

21:09.790 --> 21:11.750
would want me to act that way.

21:15.430 --> 21:17.550
She's a pretty remarkable girl,
isn't she?

21:17.630 --> 21:19.860
Yes, she is and smart, too.

21:21.150 --> 21:23.830
You know, l am kind of tired
of acting this way.

21:23.910 --> 21:27.030
So am l.
Hating burns up a lot of energy.

21:27.110 --> 21:28.710
Thirty years' worth.

21:28.790 --> 21:31.670
What do you say we start trying
to be nice to each other again?

21:31.750 --> 21:33.510
Well, l'd like that.

21:36.670 --> 21:39.470
Hello. Squishing the pop star.

21:39.830 --> 21:40.980
Sorry.

21:41.350 --> 21:43.580
l didn't say l didn't like it.

21:48.470 --> 21:52.630
<i>You're a true frien</i> d

21:55.270 --> 21:58.980
