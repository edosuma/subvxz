but this video,
which I'm sure you heard

00:47.314 --> 00:48.647
we took down
almost immediately

I've been working

the video's authenticity.

So far, no luck tracing it back
to an I.P. address,

about this recording.

Does the FBI think

this victim was actually
in the U.S. military?

If we track the flight plan
of this helicopter

it with the ISIS video,

We understand the challenge,
but this act of terrorism

by the Islamic State.

with identifying the victim.

it is temporarily

for the murder?

No. They only praised the attack
on their Twitter feed.

your mother has reasons

11:07.701 --> 11:09.334
she didn't share
with you.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.869
Such as?

11:10.871 --> 11:14.939
Maybe this child is helping
to keep her sober.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.009
Okay, well, good luck
to that baby, then,

11:18.011 --> 11:20.412
because that's more
than<i> I</i> could ever do.

11:20.414 --> 11:23.148
Every single time I feel like
I have a handle on her,

11:23.150 --> 11:25.183
she surprises me.

11:27.087 --> 11:31.022
I mean, maybe I'll never
really know who she is.

11:31.024 --> 11:34.359
Your victim's name is
probably Nicholas Greenbourne.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.829
Sykes: Served in the Army
2004 to 2010,

11:37.831 --> 11:39.364
three tours in Iraq.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.767
Uh, DMV lists his home address
in Yucca Valley.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.502
Did we I.D. him
off his prints?

11:44.504 --> 11:47.706
No -- off the clothes
he was reported wearing

11:47.708 --> 11:49.474
in the Missing Persons
report,

11:49.476 --> 11:53.344
filed with the LAPD
last Thursday.

11:53.346 --> 11:57.716
And we are sure that this head
belongs to this body?

11:57.718 --> 12:00.952
Cutting patterns
match up. See?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.754
Horrible. But convincing.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.889
Anything else?
Two things.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.925
Your victim -- when I removed
the hood from his head,

12:06.927 --> 12:09.728
I found duct tape
covering his mouth.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.995
What is it
that the killer

12:10.997 --> 12:13.164
didn't want him to say?
[ Door opens ]

12:13.166 --> 12:14.532
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

12:14.534 --> 12:16.968
We're fulfilling your ask,
Agent Soto --

12:16.970 --> 12:19.337
locating someone
who<i> might</i> be your victim --

12:19.339 --> 12:20.905
and now we're trying
to I.D. him from --

12:20.907 --> 12:22.974
The FBI requested your help
with this investigation,

12:22.976 --> 12:24.542
not that you take --
Special Agent Soto,

12:24.544 --> 12:25.810
we are all
on the same side here.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.212
The LAPD
lacks the assets

12:27.214 --> 12:29.347
to confront an international
terrorist attack

12:29.349 --> 12:31.483
on the Armed Forces
of the United States

12:31.485 --> 12:33.752
and should stand down --
<i> now.</i>

12:33.754 --> 12:35.420
We've found inconsistencies
with other,

12:35.422 --> 12:36.821
similar decapitations
that just --

12:36.823 --> 12:39.290
You're looking for consistency
from ISIS?

12:39.292 --> 12:42.994
We're asking to know
why his mouth was taped shut

12:42.996 --> 12:45.764
when the world was meant
to hear him screaming.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.799
We will answer
all of those questions

12:47.801 --> 12:49.534
when we find
our terrorist.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.102
Morris: But until we do,
we're under orders

12:51.104 --> 12:52.804
to transport the victim
to D.C.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.205
So, if you'd all just step back
from the gurney,

12:54.207 --> 12:56.040
we have a team --
Uh...

12:56.042 --> 12:59.210
Without a court order, you're
not taking this body anywhere.

12:59.212 --> 13:02.147
We can't get a court order
without publicly acknowledging

13:02.149 --> 13:03.581
that we've discovered
the victim,

13:03.583 --> 13:04.883
and we're not prepared
to do that yet

13:04.885 --> 13:05.917
for reasons pertaining --

13:05.919 --> 13:07.852
I don't care
what your reasons are.

13:07.854 --> 13:10.822
Until I see legal documentation
to the contrary,

13:10.824 --> 13:13.558
you have zero jurisdiction
in my examination room.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.794
<i> I'm</i> the authority here,

13:15.796 --> 13:19.464
so step back --
please.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.000
You know, Agent Soto,
if you're wrong about this --

13:22.002 --> 13:24.536
and you could be --
you'll just end up

13:24.538 --> 13:27.806
returning this murder to us
six months from now.

13:28.909 --> 13:31.176
Fine, Doctor.
You can finish.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.478
Thanks, but I don't need
your permission.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.814
Maybe it would be better if
the two of you waited outside --

13:35.816 --> 13:37.048
Hmm? -- with your team.

13:50.964 --> 13:54.465
Okay.
Captain, you're right.

13:54.467 --> 13:57.836
Agent Morris wants us
to drag our feet on this.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.871
But until
he can tell us why,

13:59.873 --> 14:04.309
let me at least give Agent Soto
the name of our victim.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.477
Might as well
look cooperative.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.313
Thank you, Chief.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.616
Doctor, you said
there were two things.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.084
Yes. As I was
about to say --

14:13.086 --> 14:15.987
before we were
so rudely interrupted --

14:15.989 --> 14:17.655
in addition
to the duct tape,

14:17.657 --> 14:19.858
your victim
drank himself

14:19.860 --> 14:24.395
to an alcohol level
of at least .24.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.065
Because Islamic extremists
tend to overserve.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.500
All right, Amy,
inform Lieutenant Provenza

14:29.502 --> 14:31.002
as to our progress.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.404
And we need to speak
to the people who filed

14:33.406 --> 14:36.507
this Missing Persons report
on Nicholas Greenbourne

14:36.509 --> 14:38.409
and ask them
for their help.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.680
Sykes: Miguel, Vince, Hailey,
do any of you recognize the --

14:42.682 --> 14:44.883
Oh, man. Yeah.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.417
That's what Nick was wearing
when we all went out

14:46.419 --> 14:47.919
last Wednesday night.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.155
Whoa. On the shoes...

14:51.157 --> 14:53.558
is that blood?

14:53.560 --> 14:55.894
What happened?

Um, you both
served with Nick?

Infantry, 2004 to 2010.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.568
Three tours in Iraq.

15:03.570 --> 15:08.039
Okay, now the FBI
is about to chop off<i> my</i> head.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.908
<i> Tao: You guys</i>
<i>were deployed together?</i>

15:09.910 --> 15:12.944
<i> Yes. Out of Diyala</i>

Are these
the persons reporting?

15:15.515 --> 15:17.916
Have they given us
a timeline yet?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.550
We're almost there, Chief.
Hold on.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.119
<i> Miguel: Nick struggles.</i>

15:21.121 --> 15:24.188
There's a lot of us
never fully came back from Iraq.

15:24.190 --> 15:27.058
Without structure,
without a mission,

15:27.060 --> 15:29.661
he struggles --
in life<i> and</i> in work.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.930
Carpentry jobs here and there
if his cousin calls him,

15:31.932 --> 15:33.298
but other than that...

15:33.300 --> 15:36.334
Anything...on the side?

15:37.537 --> 15:40.705
Uh, like criminal?
There's no way.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.206
Okay, so, when you last
saw him --

15:42.208 --> 15:44.542
We all went out
to dinner together,

15:44.544 --> 15:47.045
which is what we usually do
when Nick visits.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.113
And after,
he asked me to --

15:49.115 --> 15:51.716
to let Vince go out
for a drink...

15:51.718 --> 15:55.053
to celebrate our marriage
next week.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.955
Nick<i> always</i> has a reason
to celebrate.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.090
We tried to talk him into
calling it a night

15:59.092 --> 16:01.092
'cause he overdoes it,
and then Vince and I end up --

16:01.094 --> 16:02.593
We end up
bailing on him, yeah.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.229
This happens
when Nick visits us.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.065
He usually Ubers back
to our house.

16:07.067 --> 16:11.002
But Thursday morning, Nick
wasn't there when you woke up.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.204
You were worried?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.706
Well, yes.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.240
I mean,
at first, we thought

16:16.242 --> 16:19.610
he'd hooked up with someone,
but the day went on.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.012
Nick never called.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.414
His car stayed
parked outside our house.

16:23.416 --> 16:26.451
He was in town to help us
get ready for our wedding,

16:26.453 --> 16:29.387
but -- I mean, he knew
how important it was to us.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.090
He might not be the smartest man
you'll ever meet,

16:32.092 --> 16:33.157
but he's not a flake.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.026
Vince: I tried his cellphone
a few times,

16:35.028 --> 16:36.461
but when he didn't answer
or call back,

16:36.463 --> 16:39.330
I drove out to his place
in Yucca

16:39.332 --> 16:43.034
to see if somehow he'd ended up
back home, but he hadn't.

16:43.036 --> 16:46.404
I mean, this is just crazy.
Where is he?

16:46.406 --> 16:49.407
How could he
just disappear? Huh?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.776
Why is there blood
on his shoes?!

16:51.778 --> 16:54.045
This is what the police
are supposed to find out.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.016
So, what bar
did you leave Nick at?

17:04.357 --> 17:08.826

where<i> he</i> wanted to go, honey.

Ms. Leggett, um, why don't you
step outside for a moment?

a little obvious, you know,

17:57.210 --> 17:59.310
the way he hit on
the, um, waitresses,

they're used to that, right?

have boyfriends or husbands?

Uh, boyfriends?
Oh, uh, I doubt it.

walking around like that.

The place is full of
Army guys -- some Marines, too.

They pop up here from
Twentynine Palms on the weekend.

Okay, off the record...

18:37.717 --> 18:41.152
You doubt this beheading was
directed by ISIS, as well.

18:41.154 --> 18:44.288
The phrasing the killer used
on the video is inconclusive.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.258
And he said "the Prophet"
without immediately saying

18:47.260 --> 18:49.660
"Blessings be upon him"
or something like it,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.162
which is odd.

18:51.164 --> 18:55.233
So, our killer is
self-radicalized domestically?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.801
He didn't recite the Qur'an
to validate his actions,

18:56.803 --> 18:59.203
so I don't know how deep
his attachment to Islam is.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.404
He may be
what our profilers call

19:00.406 --> 19:01.772
a classic
injustice collector.

19:01.774 --> 19:03.274
Except the murder weapon

19:03.276 --> 19:05.610
was definitely a knife
from the Middle East.

19:05.612 --> 19:09.180
Which could denote
a recruit trained overseas, yes.

19:09.182 --> 19:10.414
Soto's running with that,

19:10.416 --> 19:12.483
and she's dragging Washington
with her.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.185
My guess is,
sometime tomorrow,

19:14.187 --> 19:15.686
she'll have
the necessary paperwork

19:15.688 --> 19:17.421
to come in here,
take your evidence,

19:17.423 --> 19:19.290
and this will become
a federal case

19:19.292 --> 19:21.159
focused solely on ISIS.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.628
But we can look
<i> wherever</i> we want.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.531
And, unofficially,
maybe you should.

19:34.207 --> 19:35.840
And how would she work

19:35.842 --> 19:37.909
and take care of a child
at the same time

19:37.911 --> 19:41.279
with no one to help her
and nowhere permanent to live

19:41.281 --> 19:43.848
with her house-sitting
and stuff?

19:43.850 --> 19:47.218
I don't know, but...
this makes minute 47

19:47.220 --> 19:49.620
you've spent on the difficulties
this new baby will face

19:49.622 --> 19:52.223
without saying one word
about your mother having a child

19:52.225 --> 19:54.659

who beat and abandoned you.

All right! It sucks!

20:02.235 --> 20:03.668
And it's --
and it's wrong,

20:03.670 --> 20:05.603

should have happened.

want Gary's child in your life,

20:36.569 --> 20:40.972
What the hell is
a classic injustice collector?

20:40.974 --> 20:43.641
Uh, this is the definition
I pass out at my seminars.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.711
The FBI has their own way of
explaining injustice collectors,

20:46.713 --> 20:49.247
but I guess
they're not high on this theory?

20:49.249 --> 20:51.782

29:53.559 --> 29:54.558
No.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.226
According to records,

29:56.228 --> 29:58.529
the Army personnel
in charge of financial support

29:58.531 --> 30:00.264
were caught in an ambush

30:00.266 --> 30:03.300
and were ordered
to torch the cash.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.270
And then it shows up here,
where our victim uses it

30:06.272 --> 30:08.405
to tip a girl
in a strip joint.

30:08.407 --> 30:10.207
A bikini bar, sir.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.409
Technically, finding that money
should trigger an inquiry

30:12.411 --> 30:14.278
by the Army's
Criminal Investigation Division.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.547
And the M.P.s
would be able to tell us

30:16.549 --> 30:18.916
who was ordered
to destroy that cash --

30:18.918 --> 30:21.285
as if we didn't
have a good idea already.

30:21.287 --> 30:23.487
Amy, if you could start
that inquiry, please.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.856
While she's doing that,
I can ask Morris

30:25.858 --> 30:27.157
if he'd use
the Patriot Act

30:27.159 --> 30:29.259
to get us some
useful financial information.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.194
Okay.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.428
In the meantime,
let's see

of these Henry Paulson $100s

30:34.300 --> 30:37.100
have shown up anywhere else
recently.

30:37.102 --> 30:40.437
I hear that getting married
has become very expensive --

venues, photographers.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.176
Samuel: Paying an L.A. caterer
in U.S. currency is not a crime.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.312
Yes, but the cash
Vince gave her this morning

30:48.314 --> 30:50.881
to cover
the rest of his deposit --

30:50.883 --> 30:54.885
well, it has some
peculiar features to it.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.187
Such as?
I mean, it's real, isn't it?

30:57.189 --> 30:59.256
It's<i> too</i> real --

destroyed in Iraq.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.660
Provenza: Yes,
and according to the Army,

31:03.662 --> 31:06.029
the three men
ordered to destroy this cash

31:06.031 --> 31:08.098
were your client,
his friend Miguel,

31:08.100 --> 31:10.300
and Nick, our victim.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.937
You better not be
interviewing a suspect
in my terrorist attack.

31:13.939 --> 31:16.440
Well, that all depends
on how you look at it.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.109
Right now, we're doing
a preliminary investigation

31:19.111 --> 31:20.210

31:20.212 --> 31:22.546

connect to your case.

Which is why
we asked you to join us.

So, Vince, where'd
all the money come from?

After a three-way split

32:08.427 --> 32:11.495
of the money that you were
ordered to destroy,

32:11.497 --> 32:16.066
you would be left
with about $200,000.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.301
Sounds like a lot,
doesn't it?

32:17.303 --> 32:18.602
Money...to burn.

No, sir,

took his buddy to a bar,
where he got him good and drunk,

32:41.293 --> 32:44.027
<i> and he told Nick that</i>

<i> to a pre-dug grave,</i>

32:45.364 --> 32:47.998
and then dressed up
like<i> he</i> was in ISIS

32:48.000 --> 32:51.001
and cut his friend's head off
with a knife on video

32:51.003 --> 32:53.337
to make it look like
an act of terrorism!

32:53.339 --> 32:57.541
And<i> then</i> he drove out to Yucca

Option 1 -- we let the Army
court-martial you

for theft
and dereliction of duty.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.722
During wartime, Miguel.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.358

No.
[ Stammers ]

34:23.228 --> 34:24.461

I'm only thinking about
your long-term future here,

to do well enough

Paloma's new family

You see, that's just another way
we're different.

The baby should be put up

"I sent something for you

Why do people text
to say that they've e-mailed?

Why not just say
what you want to say
in the text?

No opinions at all.

you are very patient.
