29:28.934 --> 29:31.269
Yes, please.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.773
I'll put some... maybe
I could give you some

29:33.774 --> 29:36.274
chicken already.

29:36.275 --> 29:40.194
Make room for that, I think. Here we go.

29:40.195 --> 29:43.364
Wow, it's really pretty.

29:43.365 --> 29:45.408
Am I getting a distorted picture of Turkey

29:45.409 --> 29:47.243
by spending all of my time in Istanbul?

29:47.244 --> 29:50.538
It's very different than the
rest of the country, yeah?

29:50.539 --> 29:52.665
How different?

29:52.666 --> 29:54.166
But I think in Istanbul,

29:54.167 --> 29:58.837
you have all the different
parts of Turkey also.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.507
What does it mean to be Turkish?

30:01.508 --> 30:02.925
What do you think?

30:02.926 --> 30:06.763
Serra, are you Turkish?

30:06.764 --> 30:08.766
Yes, but it's not my fault.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.942
Man, this is so... let me say,
this food is extraordinary.

30:19.943 --> 30:22.153
I mean really, really amazing.

30:22.154 --> 30:27.784
When I was here last, it
was a very different mood.

30:27.785 --> 30:33.581
Now at least the tenner of the
things said by the government

30:33.582 --> 30:36.208
are increasingly ugly.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.752
And intolerant.

30:37.753 --> 30:42.298
You've got this social
activism that's very unusual.

30:42.299 --> 30:45.009
Certainly the government is appealing

30:45.010 --> 30:50.055
to traditional Islamic values
whether it's for show or not,

30:50.056 --> 30:53.559
there seems to be some reevaluation of

30:53.560 --> 30:57.438
how much of a party town do we want to be?

30:57.439 --> 31:02.901
These days, the powers
that be don't like it.

31:02.902 --> 31:04.696
Do they genuinely not like it,

31:04.697 --> 31:06.739
or are they appealing to a political base?

31:06.740 --> 31:09.283
Oh, no, it's populism.
It's a political base.

31:09.284 --> 31:11.869
And lots of people, of course, play along

31:11.870 --> 31:13.954
saying that they don't
want to drink, et cetera,

31:13.955 --> 31:15.707
because that's the way
you get your contracts,

31:15.708 --> 31:17.208
that's the way you get things done.

31:17.209 --> 31:20.961
Nationalism seems to be working internally.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.087
Yes.

31:22.088 --> 31:23.840
Nationalism and xenophobia,

31:23.841 --> 31:25.675
it's a vote getter almost anywhere.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.553
It's a vote getter but
it's a vote loser as well

31:31.849 --> 31:36.435
