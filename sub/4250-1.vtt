WRITING A LETTER

10:05.646 --> 10:09.817
FROM A GIRL'S PERSPECTIVE?

10:09.900 --> 10:10.901
- WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO SAY?

10:13.279 --> 10:14.280
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:14.363 --> 10:15.656
NEVER MIND.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.794
- OKAY, SO, END OF LAST TERM,

10:28.878 --> 10:30.087

WHAT GIVES?

10:37.261 --> 10:38.429
- WE SPLIT UP.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.263

10:41.891 --> 10:43.309
AND WE'RE BOTH
TOTALLY COOL WITH IT.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.226

11:04.038 --> 11:05.081
IT'S NOT LIKE NINA.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.582
IT'S AS IF SHE'S DISAPPEARED.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.000
- DID YOU EVER FIND

14:12.560 --> 14:14.520
WITHOUT ANY MAIL?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.732
- YES, HE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

14:18.816 --> 14:19.358
FOR NOT BRINGING ANYTHING.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.899
- WHERE IS EDDIE?

19:10.983 --> 19:14.027
- OKAY, IF YOU WERE A GIRL--

19:15.112 --> 19:17.322
I MEAN,
YOU ARE A GIRL.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.783
AND YOU HAD TO WRITE A LETTER
DUMPING A BOY.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.535
- I WOULDN'T.
KINDA HAVE TO

19:21.618 --> 19:22.744
DO THAT THING
FACE TO FACE.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.912
- YEAH, I KNOW.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.081
SAY YOU COULDN'T--
- THEN I'D CALL.

19:26.164 --> 19:28.917
- OKAY, SAY YOU DIDN'T
HAVE A PHONE.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.795
RIGHT, WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A PHONE.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.089
AH, ANYWAY,
THE POINT IS:

19:34.173 --> 19:39.678
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
TO A BOY TO BREAK UP WITH HIM?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.054
- UM, WE'RE NOT COMPATIBLE.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.265
- THANK YOU.
YEAH, YEAH.

19:43.348 --> 19:45.225
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR A RELATIONSHIP RIGHT NOW.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.603
I THINK WE SHOULD
BE JUST FRIENDS.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.771
OH.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.607
I LOVE YOU, BUT I'M NOT
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:51.690 --> 19:55.736
AND THE CLASSIC:

19:55.819 --> 19:57.863
IT'S NOT YOU,
IT'S ME.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.449
- YES.
YES, YES.

20:00.532 --> 20:06.788
THANK YOU.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.332
- STILL DETERMINED
TO WRITE A LETTER

20:08.415 --> 20:09.958
FROM A GIRL'S PERSPECTIVE.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.711
I WONDER
WHY THAT COULD BE.

20:12.794 --> 20:14.463
AND WHO COULD SHE BE
WRITING TO?

20:14.546 --> 20:17.549
A LOVESICK BRITISH BOY PERHAPS.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.844
- OUT OF MY WAY, JERRY.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.724
- GAME ON.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.771
- HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN EDDIE?

20:30.854 --> 20:32.773
- UM, YEAH.

20:32.856 --> 20:34.691
HE WAS JUST HERE.

20:34.775 --> 20:37.653
- THAT'S WIERD.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.948
- WIERD AS IN
NOT NORMAL?

20:41.031 --> 20:44.409
BOY IS THAT A RELIEF.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.119
HE'S BEEN
PRETTY STRANGE WITH ME.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.205
- WELL, THAT COMPLETELY NORMAL.

20:48.288 --> 20:49.373
THE BOYS ARE HERE
ARE PRETTY STRANGE,

20:49.456 --> 20:52.793
BUT DON'T WORRY,
YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.343
- OH, CAREFUL.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.221
THAT'S, UH, VALUABLE.

21:04.304 --> 21:06.098
- WHAT'S IN HERE?
A DEAD BODY?

21:06.181 --> 21:06.306
- JUST GET IT UPSTAIRS.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.644
I SAID BE CAREFUL!

21:22.072 --> 21:24.032
- "I'M REALLY SORRY.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.575
YADA YADA YADA.

21:25.659 --> 21:28.620
"LOTS OF LOVE."

21:28.704 --> 21:29.579
COME ON, EDDIE.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.957
DUDE, JUST TELL THE GUY.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.250
- TELL WHICH GUY WHAT?

21:36.169 --> 21:37.546
- AH...

21:37.629 --> 21:40.841
FABIAN, OBVIOUSLY, THAT--

21:40.924 --> 21:42.134
DUDE, HE NEEDS TO
PICK UP HIS SOCKS.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.594
HE'S SMELLING UP THE PLACE.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.221
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

21:46.304 --> 21:46.388
I'M--

21:55.981 --> 21:56.982
- [sighs]

22:03.405 --> 22:04.906
- WELL, GRAMPS.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.033
I'M HERE.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.204
- THERE REALLY WAS A KEY.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.834
- IT WILL SOON BE TIME.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.923
[air hissing]
