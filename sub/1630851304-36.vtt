WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:03.620
THERE IS LESS
THAN A WEEK TO GO BEFORE

00:03.655 --> 00:06.827
THE LIVE FINALE, AND
TONIGHT THE FINAL PUSH TO

00:06.862 --> 00:09.103
TAKE HOME THE
THREE-QUARTERS OF A

00:09.137 --> 00:10.965
MILLION DOLLARS BEGINS.

00:11.000 --> 00:14.137
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER"!

00:14.172 --> 00:16.758
PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"...EARLY

00:16.793 --> 00:22.137
IN THE GAME, BIG "D" AND
XAVIER MADE A FINAL TWO.

00:22.172 --> 00:24.655
ME AND YOU HAVE FINAL
TWO.

00:24.689 --> 00:26.310
AND WANTING TO BUILD TRUST

00:26.344 --> 00:32.517
WITH HIS BEST TEE, AZAH,
BIG "D" CAME CLEAN.

00:32.551 --> 00:33.586
I FOLLOWED THAT SINCE
DAY ONE.

00:33.620 --> 00:36.965
I'VE KNOWN PRETTY MUCH
ABOUT ALL OF BIG "D"'S

00:37.000 --> 00:39.379
PLANS UP UNTIL THIS
MOMENT.

00:39.413 --> 00:42.620
WITH "X"
HOLDING ALL OF THE

00:42.655 --> 00:44.172
POWER --
CONGRATULATIONS,

00:44.206 --> 00:46.413
XAVIER, YOU ARE THE NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

00:46.448 --> 00:49.586
BETTER BUCKLE UP,
AMERICA.

00:49.620 --> 00:53.103
NOWR>>HE PLANS
TO ELIMINATE HIS BIGGEST

00:53.137 --> 00:54.206
THREAT.

00:54.241 --> 00:56.551
"D," YOU HAVE A CHANCE
TO TAKE A BIG THREAT OUT,

00:56.586 --> 00:59.310
THEN YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT
SHOT.

00:59.344 --> 01:01.965
AND XAVIER
WANTED BIG "D" TO BE THE

01:02.000 --> 01:07.931
SSOLE VOTE TO TAKE HIM OUT.

01:07.965 --> 01:10.896
WILL BIG "D" FOLLOW
THROUGH WITH THE PLAN?

01:10.931 --> 01:11.965
THAT'S THE BIG QUESTION.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.482
AFTER THE
LIVE VETO MEETING...

01:14.517 --> 01:19.103
I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO
USE THE POWER OF VETO.

01:19.137 --> 01:21.724
BIG "D"
MADE A BIG BLINDSIDE.

01:21.758 --> 01:25.413
I CAST MY VOTE TO EVICT
KYLAND.

01:25.448 --> 01:35.034
AND THE
HOUSEGUESTS SENT KY-ONARA.

01:35.068 --> 01:44.241
NOW WITH ONLY AZAH,
XAVIER, AND D DEREK "X"

01:44.275 --> 01:48.000
LEFT, PART ONE OF THE
FINAL HOUSEHOLD

01:48.034 --> 01:51.517
COMPETITION WILL BE PLAYED
OT TONIGHT.

01:51.551 --> 01:57.241
WHO WILL ADVANCE AND BE
ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE

01:57.275 --> 01:58.310
THREE-QUARTERS OF A
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:58.344 --> 02:00.413
THIS IS THE LAST STEP
BEFORE FINALE NIGHT.

02:00.448 --> 02:07.931
IT ALL HAPPENS RIGHT NOW
ON "BIG BROTHER"!

02:07.965 --> 02:20.448
Dâ™ª
GOOD EVENING.

02:20.482 --> 02:22.896
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

02:22.931 --> 02:25.103
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

02:25.137 --> 02:28.344
XAVIER, AZAH AND BIG "D,"
THEY WERE ALL IN THE

02:28.379 --> 02:31.275
COOKOUT, UNITED BY A
COMMON GOAL, BUT THEY TOOK

02:31.310 --> 02:34.103
THREE VERY DIFFERENT PATHS
TO MAKE IT TO FINALE

02:34.137 --> 02:34.965
NIGHT.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.724
SO HOW DID THEY BECOME THE
FINAL THREE?

02:36.758 --> 02:40.896
THEY'LL TELL US IN THEIR
OWN WORDS TONIGHT.

02:40.931 --> 02:45.000
THEN PART ONE OF THE FINAL
THREE-PART HEAD OF

02:45.034 --> 02:47.034
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION
PLAYS OUT.

02:47.068 --> 02:49.586
WHOMEVER WINS WILL
AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCE TO

02:49.620 --> 02:53.206
PART THREE ON FINALE NIGHT
THIS WEDNESDAY.

02:53.241 --> 02:56.379
BUT, FIRST, XAVIER ENTERED
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE

02:56.413 --> 02:59.000
WITH A SECRET IDENTITY,
TELLING EVERYONE THAT HE

02:59.034 --> 03:02.241
IS A BARTENDER WHEN HE IS
REALLY A LAWYER.

03:02.275 --> 03:07.862
BUT WHAT WAS THE SECRET
THAT GOT HIM TO THE FINAL

03:07.896 --> 03:08.310
THREE?

03:08.344 --> 03:11.862
OH, MY GOSH.

03:11.896 --> 03:12.344
WOW!

03:12.379 --> 03:14.034
YO!

03:14.068 --> 03:15.551
THIS IS SO COOL.

03:15.586 --> 03:18.517
COMING INTO THIS GAME,
I KNEW PEOPLE MIGHT WANT

03:18.551 --> 03:22.517
TO TARGET ME BECAUSE I
HAVE AN ATHLETIC BUILD,

03:22.551 --> 03:26.206
AND USUALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE
VIEWED AS PHYSICAL THREATS

03:26.241 --> 03:27.931
GO HOME FIRST.

03:27.965 --> 03:31.068
BEGINNING ON DAY ONE I
CONCEALED MY IDENTITY NOT

03:31.103 --> 03:35.379
ONLY AS A FORMER ATHLETE
BUT AS AN ATTORNEY TO THE

03:35.413 --> 03:37.310
REST OF THE HOUSEGUESTS.

03:37.344 --> 03:42.482
I'M XAVIER AND I'M A
BARTENDER LIVING IN

03:42.517 --> 03:43.551
MILWAUKEE.

03:43.586 --> 03:47.034
I FEEL IF I DIDN'T CONCEAL
MY IDENTITY, I WOULDN'T

03:47.068 --> 03:48.896
HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR.

03:48.931 --> 03:51.586
YOU SAY YOU'RE A
BARTENDER?

03:51.620 --> 03:53.000
HE COULD BE AN F.B.I.

03:53.034 --> 03:54.896
HE IS FOR SURE A
LAWYER.

03:54.931 --> 03:59.896
I NEED TO DO EVERYTHING
IN MY POWER TO MINIMIZE MY

03:59.931 --> 04:02.517
THREAT.

04:03.586 --> 04:06.758
AND I WANTED TO STAY
FOCUSED ON THE GOAL AT

04:06.793 --> 04:11.965
HAND, WHICH MEANT NO
DISTRACTION, WHICH

04:12.000 --> 04:13.068
INCLUDES SHOWMANCES.

04:13.103 --> 04:16.482
THERE ARE A LOT OF LOVELY
LADIES, BUT THEY COULDN'T

04:16.517 --> 04:18.172
COME BEFORE WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

04:18.206 --> 04:20.793
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I TRUST COMPLETELY.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.655
SO I'M GOING TO DO
WHATEVER YOU TELL ME TO

04:22.689 --> 04:23.620
DO.

04:23.655 --> 04:25.448
THE BEST WAY TO GET
PROTECTION IN THE "BIG

04:25.482 --> 04:27.931
BROTHER" HOUSE IS THROUGH
ALLIANCES.

04:27.965 --> 04:33.724
I MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH
BIG "D," AND WEEK ONE

04:33.758 --> 04:36.482
FRENCHIE INVITED ME INTO
THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

04:36.517 --> 04:39.103
WE CAN CALL IT THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

04:39.137 --> 04:41.758
AND THE ROYAL FLUSH,
WHICH WAS THE COMBINATION

04:41.793 --> 04:45.896
OF THE FORMER QUEEN'S
TEAM, AND THE FORMER

04:45.931 --> 04:50.103
KING'S TEAM, AND DEREK
"X."

04:50.137 --> 04:53.103
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT
ALLIANCE I JOINED WAS NONE

04:53.137 --> 04:54.862
OTHER THAN THE COOKOUT.

04:54.896 --> 04:57.000
COOKOUT, I LIKE THAT.

04:57.034 --> 04:58.482
THAT'S THE CULTURE.

04:58.517 --> 05:01.793
AS A BLACK MAN IN
AMERICA, THE MISSION OF

05:01.827 --> 05:04.379
THE COOKOUT WAS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE

05:04.413 --> 05:05.413
REPRESENTATION MATTERS.

05:05.448 --> 05:07.724
OUR MISSION WAS TO MAKE
SURE THAT "BIG BROTHER"

05:07.758 --> 05:10.344
WOULD CROWN ITS FIRST
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER.

05:10.379 --> 05:14.034
WE'VE GOT ALL THREE.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.000
WE'LL GO ON THREE.

05:15.034 --> 05:19.689
I WOULD SAY I WAS
DEFINITELY THE GLUE THAT

05:19.724 --> 05:21.517
KEPT THE COOKOUT TOGETHER.

05:21.551 --> 05:24.310
YOU WANT TO GO OUTSIDE?

05:24.344 --> 05:27.896
I WAS ABLE TO HELP THE
GROUP STAY STRONG, STAY

05:27.931 --> 05:30.137
TOGETHER, AND STAY FOCUSED
ON THE MISSION AT HAND.

05:30.172 --> 05:33.517
I DON'T KNOW IF I TOLD
YOU THAT SHE CHECKED ME.

05:33.551 --> 05:41.172
THERE SHOULD BE NO
HOSTILITY BETWEEN THE TWO

05:41.206 --> 05:42.103
OF US.

05:42.137 --> 05:44.551
I WAS REALLY
COMPETITIVE, AND THROWING

05:44.586 --> 05:47.896
COMPETITIONS EARLY ON IN
THE GAME WAS ESSENTIAL TO

05:47.931 --> 05:50.000
MAINTAINING A LOW
THRESHOLD LEVEL.

05:50.034 --> 05:54.896
I'M NOT PUTTING YOU
OUT, BRO, I PROMISE.

05:54.931 --> 05:56.586
THAT'S OKAY.

05:56.620 --> 05:59.724
XAVIER WAS FIRST TO
BRING IN THE WILDCARD AND

05:59.758 --> 06:02.310
THAT IS INCORRECT.

06:02.344 --> 06:04.862
CONGRATULATIONS, HANNA.

06:04.896 --> 06:06.586
SIX OUT OF SEVEN CORRECT.

06:06.620 --> 06:07.793
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

06:07.827 --> 06:10.655
HOWEVER, I DID ALSO
WANT TO WIN AN H.O.H.

06:10.689 --> 06:15.137
EARLY ON TO ESTABLISH WHAT
THEWITH THE REST OF THE

06:15.172 --> 06:16.896
HOUSEGUESTS THAT, HEY,
THIS IS SOMEONE YOU CAN

06:16.931 --> 06:18.517
TRUST WHENEVER THEY'RE IN
POWER.

06:18.551 --> 06:23.620
SO IN WEEK THREE, I WON MY
FIRST H.O.H. COMPETITION.

06:23.655 --> 06:24.413
CONGRATULATIONS, XAVIER,

06:24.448 --> 06:26.827
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

06:26.862 --> 06:34.655
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I
HAVE NOMINATED IS...BY

06:34.689 --> 06:37.241
TARGETING BRENT, IT
ALLOWED ME TO GAIN FAVOR

06:37.275 --> 06:39.931
WITH THE REST OF THE
HOUSE, AND IT ALLOWED ME

06:39.965 --> 06:43.448
TO ENSURE NO MEMBER OF THE
COOKOUT WAS GOING TO GO

06:43.482 --> 06:44.586
HOME THAT WEEK.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.793
BRENT, YOU ARE
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG

06:46.827 --> 06:47.827
BROTHER" HOUSE.

06:47.862 --> 06:50.551
BUT THINGS HAVE NOT
ALWAYS GONE MY WAY IN THE

06:50.586 --> 06:51.344
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE THIS
SUMMER.

06:51.379 --> 06:54.137
THE BALL HAS LANDED ON
XAVIER.

06:54.172 --> 06:56.827
YOU ARE NOW NOMINATED FOR
EVICTION.

06:56.862 --> 06:59.896
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT IN THE
NOMINATION CHAIR.

06:59.931 --> 07:04.965
STUPID-ASS CHOPPING
BLOCK.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.896
APPARENTLY ME AND THE
CHOPPING BLOCK LOOK GOOD

07:06.931 --> 07:10.551
BECAUSE I SAW IT FOUR MORE
TIMES THROUGHOUT THE

07:10.586 --> 07:11.482
SEASON.

07:11.517 --> 07:12.310
WE'RE GOING TO BE
NOMINATING YOU TODAY.

07:12.344 --> 07:15.344
THE KEY TO "BIG
BROTHER" IS WINNING

07:15.379 --> 07:17.034
COMPETITIONS WERE YOU NEED
TO.

07:17.068 --> 07:19.620
THERE WERE TWO SITUATIONS
WHERE I WAS NOMINATED AND

07:19.655 --> 07:23.034
I WON THE GOLDEN POWER OF
VETO TO TAKE MYSELF OFF

07:23.068 --> 07:24.000
THE BLOCK.

07:24.034 --> 07:26.620
XAVIER HAS WON THE
GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

07:26.655 --> 07:31.931
I HAVE DECIDED TO USE
THE POWER OF VETO ON

07:31.965 --> 07:32.620
MYSELF.

07:34.482 --> 07:35.689
CONGRATULATIONS, XAVIER.

07:35.724 --> 07:38.000
YOU HAVE WON THE POWER OF
VETO.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.103
THANK YOU.

07:39.137 --> 07:42.689
ALYSSA, YOU'VE BEEN MY
BEST FRIEND AND ONE OF MY

07:42.724 --> 07:44.896
CLOSEST ALLIES IN THIS
GAME, BUT I HAVE TO USE

07:44.931 --> 07:46.655
THE POWER OF VETO ON
MYSELF.

07:46.689 --> 07:49.827
EASILY ONE OF THE
HARDEST THINGS FOR ME THIS

07:49.862 --> 07:51.827
SEASON WAS HAVING TO LOSE
ALYSSA.

07:51.862 --> 07:56.379
BY A VOTE OF
3-1, ALYSSA, YOU ARE

07:56.413 --> 07:58.034
EVICTED FROM THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

07:58.068 --> 08:01.655
EVEN THOUGH ALYSSA HAD
TO GO IN ORDER FOR THE

08:01.689 --> 08:03.965
COOKOUT TO MAKE THE FINAL
SIX, IT WAS STILL HARD TO

08:04.000 --> 08:07.620
SEE NOT ONLY A CLOSE ALLY,
BUT A VERY GOOD FRIEND OF

08:07.655 --> 08:12.000
MINE WALK OUT THOSE DOORS.

08:12.034 --> 08:15.758
WELCOME TO THE COOKOUT!

08:18.448 --> 08:22.586
> ONCE WE GOT DOWN TO THE
FINAL SIX, IT BECAME AN

08:22.620 --> 08:23.655
INDIVIDUAL GAME.

08:23.689 --> 08:26.655
I ALREADY HAD MY FINAL TWO
WITH BIG "D," AND KYLAND

08:26.689 --> 08:29.310
OFFERED ME A FINAL TWO,
WHICH I ACCEPTED.

08:29.344 --> 08:33.275
I WANT TO, AND I THINK
YOU WANT TO.

08:33.310 --> 08:35.896
WITH ALL OF THESE DEALS
IN PLACE, IT WAS TIME TO

08:35.931 --> 08:38.000
GET OUT MY BIGGEST THREAT,
TIFFANY.

08:38.034 --> 08:42.241
AND I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE
KYLAND TO TARGET TIFFANY

08:42.275 --> 08:51.068
DURING HIS H.O.H. WEEK --
WORST-CASE SCENARIO, WE

08:51.103 --> 08:53.896
LOSE OUR NUMBERS IF BIG
"D" GOES UP.

08:53.931 --> 08:54.965
THAT IS THE RISK WITH
THAT.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.965
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

08:59.000 --> 09:02.034
YOU AND I GETTING TO THE
END.

09:02.068 --> 09:10.862
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I
HAVE NOMINATED IS...

09:10.896 --> 09:14.034
TIFFANY, YOU
ARE EVICTED FROM THE "BIG

09:14.068 --> 09:15.000
BROTHER" HOUSE.

09:15.034 --> 09:19.965
AND SINCE HANNAH
ARGUABLY TIFFANY'S RIGHT

09:20.000 --> 09:23.965
HAND WOMAN, UNFORTUNATELY
HANNAH HAD TO GO NEXT.

09:24.000 --> 09:29.724
BY AN
ANONYMOUS VOTE OF 2-0,

09:29.758 --> 09:31.793
HANNAH, YOU ARE EVICTED
FROM THE "BIG BROTHER"

09:31.827 --> 09:32.827
HOUSE.

09:32.862 --> 09:35.724
AND KYLAND AND BIG "D"
REMAINED IN THE FINAL

09:35.758 --> 09:36.827
FOUR.

09:36.862 --> 09:41.827
NOT ONLY WAS S I ABLE TO WIN
THE FINAL H.O.H. OF THE

09:41.862 --> 09:42.862
SUMMER --
CONGRATULATIONS,

09:42.896 --> 09:45.241
XAVIER, YOU ARE THE NEW
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

09:45.275 --> 09:48.862
-- BUT I WAS ALSO ABLE
TO WIN THE MOST IMPORTANT

09:48.896 --> 09:53.172
VETO COMPETITION OF THE
SUMMER.

09:53.206 --> 09:55.379
EVEN THOUGH KYLAND
PROMISED TO TAKE ME TO THE

09:55.413 --> 09:58.586
FINAL TWO, WHEN IT COMES
DOWN TO IT, THIS IS THE

09:58.620 --> 09:59.275
GAME OF "BIG BROTHER."

09:59.310 --> 10:00.413
KYLAND IS A BIG THREAT.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.137
I HAD TO GO WITH THE ODDS.

10:02.172 --> 10:03.827
WHICH MEANT KYLAND HAD TO
GO.

10:03.862 --> 10:08.310
IF WE KEEP KYLAND, THE
CHANCES OF BEATING HIM ARE

10:08.344 --> 10:09.172
MORE DIFFICULT.

10:09.206 --> 10:11.862
I THINK BOTH OF US CAN
BEAT AZAH IN ANY

10:11.896 --> 10:12.965
COMPETITION.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.034
I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE
BIG "D" THAT WAS BEST FOR

10:15.068 --> 10:16.724
HIS GAME TO VOTE KYLAND
OUT.

10:16.758 --> 10:20.000
I CAST MY VOTE TO EVICT
KYLAND.

10:20.034 --> 10:22.551
OKAY.

10:22.586 --> 10:24.206
KYLAND IS A BIG THREAT.

10:24.241 --> 10:27.034
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR
ME TO TAKE THAT SHOT, I

10:27.068 --> 10:27.413
TOOK IT.

10:27.448 --> 10:31.344
WALK.

10:31.793 --> 10:34.931
EVERYTHING I'VE DONE IN
MY LIFE HAS BEEN MOTIVATED

10:34.965 --> 10:36.551
BY FAMILY, INCLUDING THIS
SHOW.

10:36.586 --> 10:42.034
MY DESIRE TO WIN THIS
SEASON IS TO PAY HOMAGE TO

10:42.068 --> 10:43.137
MY BIG BROTHER.

10:43.172 --> 10:45.206
HE PASSED SHORTLY BEFORE I
ENTERED THE "BIG BROTHER"

10:45.241 --> 10:45.758
HOUSE.

10:45.793 --> 10:46.827
HE LEFT BEHIND A SON.

10:46.862 --> 10:50.241
I MADE A PROMISE TO MY BIG
BROTHER AS LONG AS I WAS

10:50.275 --> 10:53.034
AROUND, HIS SON WOULD WANT
FOR NOTHING IF I HAD

10:53.068 --> 10:54.689
ANYTHING TO DO ABOUT IT.

10:54.724 --> 10:59.379
AT THIS STAGE OF THE GAME,
LOSING IS NOT AN OPTION.

10:59.413 --> 11:06.758
I'VE COME TOO FAR, I'M
COMGONE TOO FAR.

11:06.793 --> 11:10.655
I MADE A PROMISE TO MY
BROTHER, AND I'M NOT GOING

11:10.689 --> 11:13.689
TO LET ANYTHING GET IN THE
WAY OF THAT.

11:13.724 --> 11:15.517
GOOD LUCK.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.517
UP NEXT...FLYING UNDER THE

11:18.551 --> 11:23.034
RADAR AND UNDERESTIMATED
BY HER HOUSEMATES, AZAH

11:23.068 --> 11:25.482
MAKES HER CASE WHY SHE
SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

11:25.517 --> 11:28.103
ON FINEE NIG FINAL NIGHT.

11:28.137 --> 11:32.413
THEN PART ONE OF THE FINAL
COMPETITION BEGINS AND WHO

11:32.448 --> 11:37.068
WILL ADVANCE TO PART THREE
ON FINALE NIGHT.

11:37.103 --> 11:38.620
FIND OUT BEFORE THE HOUR
IS UP.

11:38.655 --> 11:40.137
STAY WITH US.

11:49.310 --> 11:51.344
WELCOME BACK
TO "BIG BROTHER."

11:51.379 --> 11:56.655
WHETHER IT WAS HER TEAM,
THE JOKERS, OR HER

11:56.689 --> 12:00.206
ALLIANCE, THE COOKOUT,
AZAH REMAINED LOYAL TO

12:00.241 --> 12:02.517
WHOMEVER SHE WAS WORKING
WITH IN THE GAME.

12:02.551 --> 12:06.034
HER STRATEGY PAID OFF AS
SHE IS THE LAST WOMAN

12:06.068 --> 12:09.793
STANDING, BUT HER PATH TO
THE END WASN'T ALWAYS AN

12:09.827 --> 12:10.793
EASY ONE.

12:10.827 --> 12:17.275
I'M -- AS SOMEONE WHO
HAS SEEN EVERY SINGLE

12:17.310 --> 12:19.517
SEASON OF "BIG BROTHER,"
WHEN I CAME INTO THE

12:19.551 --> 12:23.655
HOUSE, I WAS READY TO BE
THAT ALPHA FEMALE.

12:23.689 --> 12:25.862
COME ON, AZAH.

12:25.896 --> 12:28.896
EVERYONE ACCEPT FOR AZAH GETS A

12:28.931 --> 12:29.931
POINT.

12:29.965 --> 12:35.620
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE AS

12:35.655 --> 12:36.655
EASY AS I THOUGHT.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.551
I KNEW I WASN'T THE BEST
AT COMPS, AND I DIDN'T

12:39.586 --> 12:41.931
HAVE THE BIGGEST
PERSONALITY IN THE HOUSE,

12:41.965 --> 12:48.137
SO I HAD TO PLAY AN
UNDER-THE-RADAR STRATEGY.

12:48.172 --> 12:51.586
FIRST, I SOLIDIFIED MY
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY

12:51.620 --> 12:52.655
FELLOW JOKERS.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.344
AND CONGRATULATIONS TO THE

12:54.379 --> 12:54.862
JOKERS.

12:54.896 --> 12:55.931
THE JOKERS HAVE WON.

12:55.965 --> 13:00.000
AND THEN I JOINED THE
COOKOUT WHICH CONSISTED OF

13:00.034 --> 13:03.586
MYSELF, BIG "D," HANNAH,
"X," TIFFANY, AND KYLAND.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.379
BEING IN THE COOKOUT WAS
REALLY GOOD FOR MY GAME

13:06.413 --> 13:09.827
BECAUSE MANY OF THE PEOPLE
IN THE COOKOUT MADE

13:09.862 --> 13:12.310
THEMSELVES BIGGER TARGETS
THAN ME.

13:12.344 --> 13:13.344
CONGRATULATIONS, KYLAND.

13:13.379 --> 13:16.137
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

13:16.172 --> 13:16.931
CONGRATULATIONS, XAVIER.

13:16.965 --> 13:18.586
YOU ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.827
CONGRATULATIONS,
TIFFANY, YOU ARE NOW THE

13:20.862 --> 13:21.827
NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

13:21.862 --> 13:24.586
IT TURNED OUT IT WAS A
GOOD THING I WASN'T

13:24.620 --> 13:25.931
WINNING H.O.H.

13:25.965 --> 13:27.965
COMPETITIONS BECAUSE
KYLAND, TIFFANY, AND

13:28.000 --> 13:32.413
XAVIER ENDED UP HAVING A
BLOOD BATH, AND I CAME OUT

13:32.448 --> 13:35.206
SQUESQUEAKY CLEAN.

13:35.241 --> 13:41.206
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I
HAVE NOMINATED IS...

13:41.241 --> 13:46.689
I AM CHOOSING TO
REPLACE MY NOMINATION WITH

13:46.724 --> 13:48.034
YOU, CLAIRE.

13:48.068 --> 13:51.758
MEANWHILE, I WAS
KEEPING A LOW PROFILE AND

13:51.793 --> 13:53.586
BUILDING GENUINE PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIPS.

13:53.620 --> 13:57.724
WELCOME TO "BIG
BROTHER"!

13:57.758 --> 14:02.482
â™ª WHERE EVERYBODY HAS
RULES â™ª

14:02.517 --> 14:03.965
IT'S HARD.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.241
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE, BUT
IT IS HARD.

14:05.275 --> 14:08.655
I KNOW IT IS GOING TO
BE OFF BECAUSE EVERYONE IS

14:08.689 --> 14:12.206
GOING TO WANT TO VOTE FOR
THEIR BEST FRIEND, AZAH.

14:12.241 --> 14:13.896
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T
CRY.

14:13.931 --> 14:16.896
IT IS OKAY, DON'T CRY.

14:16.931 --> 14:19.896
THIS MIGHT SOUND CRAZY
IN THIS HOUSE, BUT PART OF

14:19.931 --> 14:26.620
MY GAME WAS JUST BEING
HONEST WITH PEOPLE.

14:26.655 --> 14:29.793
I HAVE A LITTLE

14:29.827 --> 14:30.896
AGGRESSION.

14:30.931 --> 14:33.896
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO
GO TO THE POND THIS WEEK?

14:33.931 --> 14:36.137
NO.

14:36.172 --> 14:37.206
OKAY.

14:37.241 --> 14:41.379
I'M NOT GOING TO LIE,
THIS GAME HAS GOTTEN ME A

14:41.413 --> 14:42.137
LITTLE HARDER.

14:42.172 --> 14:44.586
I AIN'T NO LITTLE BITCH NO
MORE.

14:44.620 --> 14:47.793
EVEN IF IT MEANT
CALLING OUT MY OWN

14:47.827 --> 14:48.689
ALLIANCE.

14:48.724 --> 14:51.103
WHY DID YOU GO TO
BRITTANY AND NOT --

14:51.137 --> 14:52.827
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

14:52.862 --> 14:53.896
OKAY.

14:53.931 --> 14:55.793
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO
TELL YOU.

14:55.827 --> 14:58.862
I WOULD HAVE DONE
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

14:58.896 --> 15:01.689
WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT
OPINIONS ON HOW TO PLAY.

15:01.724 --> 15:03.551
WHY DID YOU KEEP ON
PICKING ME?

15:03.586 --> 15:09.000
I DON'T KNOW OF ANY
OTHER ALLIES THAT BRITINI

15:09.034 --> 15:09.758
HAS.

15:09.793 --> 15:11.034
BUT YOU PICKED ME.

15:11.068 --> 15:14.827
EVEN IT CAUSED
FRICTION, EVERYONE KNEW

15:14.862 --> 15:17.586
WHERE I STOOD AND NO ONE
COULD EVER CALL ME A

15:17.620 --> 15:18.206
SNAKE.

15:18.241 --> 15:20.620
WELCOME TO THE COOKOUT.

15:20.655 --> 15:24.137
ONCE WE GOT TO THE
FINAL SIX, I FELT ABSOLUTE

15:24.172 --> 15:25.241
JOY.

15:25.275 --> 15:30.551
NOT JUST AT US, BUT AT THE
THOUGHT THAT EVERY LITTLE

15:30.586 --> 15:33.896
AFRICAN-AMERICAN KID
LOOKING AT THE TELEVISION

15:33.931 --> 15:36.586
COULD BE BEAM, SMILE, AND
FEEL THEY COULD BE A PART

15:36.620 --> 15:39.379
OF THIS, TOO, AND ONE DAY
MAKE IT.

15:39.413 --> 15:41.896
BUT WE FINALLY HAD TO TURN
ON EACH OTHER.

15:41.931 --> 15:45.000
HOWEVER, BECAUSE I WAS
KEEPING A LOW PROFILE, I

15:45.034 --> 15:46.620
WASN'T AT THE TOP OF THE
HIT LIST.

15:46.655 --> 15:53.344
I NOMINATED, TIFFANY,
AND YOU, HANNAH.

15:53.379 --> 15:56.379
BUT WHEN I THOUGHT I
MIGHT BE IN TROUBLE IN THE

15:56.413 --> 16:03.379
SECOND DOUBLE EVICTION, I
STOPPED LAYING LOW AND I

16:03.413 --> 16:08.137
FED XAVIER TO WIN MY FIRST
H.O.H.

16:08.172 --> 16:09.413
CONGRATULATIONS, AZAH, YOU

16:09.448 --> 16:10.413
ARE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

16:10.448 --> 16:13.862
I WAS PLAYING AN HONEST
GAME UNTIL I LIED TO

16:13.896 --> 16:14.482
HANNAH.

16:14.517 --> 16:21.344
I'M NOT PUTTING YOU UP.

16:21.379 --> 16:22.448
OKAY.

16:22.482 --> 16:27.000
BUT TARGETING HER WAS
WHAT I NEEDED TO DO TO GET

16:27.034 --> 16:28.931
TO THE END OF THIS GAME.

16:28.965 --> 16:30.620
HANNAH, YOU

16:30.655 --> 16:32.586
ARE EVICTED FROM THE "BIG
BROTHER" HOUSE.

16:32.620 --> 16:36.931
AND THANKS TO MY
UNDER-THE-RADAR GAME PLAY,

16:36.965 --> 16:39.103
I DIDN'T SEE THE BLOCK
UNTIL FINAL FOUR.

16:39.137 --> 16:42.275
I NOMINATED YOU, AZAH,
AND YOU, KYLAND.

16:42.310 --> 16:46.448
I MAY NOT HAVE WON THE
FINAL FOUR VETO, BUT I DID

16:46.482 --> 16:49.413
ENSURE MY SPOTS IN THE
FINAL THREE BECAUSE OF THE

16:49.448 --> 16:52.241
RELATIONSHIP I BUILT THE
ENTIRE SEASON WITH BIG

16:52.275 --> 16:54.586
"D," EVEN THOUGH HE DID
WAIVER BACK AND FORTH A

16:54.620 --> 16:55.586
LITTLE BIT.

16:55.620 --> 16:58.034
I HAVE HAD THESE DEALS
SINCE THE BEGINNING.

16:58.068 --> 17:01.931
THIS IS ESSENTIAL THE
FINAL THREE WITH THE GUYS,

17:01.965 --> 17:06.206
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

17:06.241 --> 17:08.413
HE IS GOING TO BE THERE

17:08.448 --> 17:09.931
FOR ME.

17:09.965 --> 17:11.586
I NEED A RESPONSE.

17:11.620 --> 17:17.793
AT THIS POINT, I CAST
MY VOTE TO EVICT KYLAND.

17:17.827 --> 17:19.896
IT'S OFFICIAL,
KYLAND.

17:19.931 --> 17:23.034
I PLAYED THE MOST
AUTHENTIC, LOYAL, AND

17:23.068 --> 17:25.931
HONEST GAME IN THE HOUSE,
AND THAT KEPT ME SAFE ALL

17:25.965 --> 17:26.931
SEASON.

17:26.965 --> 17:29.172
"BIG BROTHER" HAVING ITS
FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN

17:29.206 --> 17:31.068
WINNER IS INCREDIBLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

17:31.103 --> 17:33.896
AND I WANT THAT WINNER TO
BE ME.

17:33.931 --> 17:36.103
HI, AZAH, HOW ARE YOU?

17:36.137 --> 17:39.689
A FEW YEARS AGO, MY DAD
ENCOUNTERED A BATTLE WITH

17:39.724 --> 17:42.655
CANCER, AND WE FACED A LOT
OF DIFFICULT HARDSHIPS.

17:42.689 --> 17:47.379
BUT NOW I'M GOING TO USE
THAT $750,000 TO BUY THEM

17:47.413 --> 17:50.965
A NEW HOUSE, AND THAT'S
WHAT KEEPS ME MOTIVATED

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
EVERY SINGLE DAY IN HERE.

17:53.034 --> 17:53.931
GOD BLESS YOU.

17:53.965 --> 17:57.896
I LOVE YOU, DADDY AND
MOMMY.

17:57.931 --> 18:01.034
I CAN VISUALIZE AND SEE
MYSELF WINNING.

18:01.068 --> 18:02.827
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO
WIN.

18:02.862 --> 18:04.862
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT I
FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO

18:04.896 --> 18:05.275
WIN.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.517
TOP THREE.

18:06.551 --> 18:08.413
WE MADE IT!

18:08.448 --> 18:11.379
â™ª WE MADE IT
ALL OF THE SINGING AND

18:11.413 --> 18:12.655
DANCING GOT US THERE.

18:12.689 --> 18:17.931
DAVID BEAT GOLIATH, AND
I'M GOING TO BEAT BOTH OF

18:17.965 --> 18:18.896
THESE BOYS.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.758
I'M GOING TO WIN THAT
FINAL H.O.H., AND I'M

18:20.793 --> 18:23.034
GOING TO WIN THIS GAME.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.931
WHEN WE
RETURN, WHAT DOES BIG "D"

18:25.965 --> 18:28.620
THINK HE HAS DONE TO
SEPARATE HIMSELF FROM HIS

18:28.655 --> 18:32.034
ALLIES IN THE FINAL THREE?

18:32.068 --> 18:35.551
THEN, XAVIER, AZAH, AND
BIG "D" FACE OFF IN PART

18:35.586 --> 18:38.103
ONE OF THE LAST HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION OF

18:38.137 --> 18:38.931
THE SUMMER.

18:38.965 --> 18:40.965
STAY WITH US.

18:48.275 --> 18:50.448
WELCOME BACK
TO "BIG BROTHER."

18:50.482 --> 18:53.724
BIG "D" IS THE SON OF
BOXING LEGEND SMOKIN' JOE

18:53.758 --> 18:57.137
FRAZER, BUT HE WANTED TO
CARVE OUT HIS OWN LEGACY

18:57.172 --> 18:59.000
IN THE "BIG BROTHER"
HOUSE.

18:59.034 --> 19:02.413
HE HASN'T WON A SINGLE
COMPETITION YET, BUT THAT

19:02.448 --> 19:04.620
DOESN'T MEAN HE HASN'T
DOMINATED THE GAME.

19:04.655 --> 19:12.931
MY NAME IS DERRICK, I'M
FROM PHILADELPHIA, P.A.

19:12.965 --> 19:16.620
I KNEW I WAS GOING TO TEAR
THIS HOUSE UP.

19:16.655 --> 19:22.068
SINCSINCE THERE IS ANOTHER
DEREK, I WILL GO BY BIG

19:22.103 --> 19:23.103
"D."

19:23.137 --> 19:25.655
I WANTED TO REPRESENT
BEING BLACK, I WANTED TO

19:25.689 --> 19:28.482
REPRESENT BEING GAY, AND I
WANTED TO REPRESENT BEING

19:28.517 --> 19:29.586
THE BIG GUY.

19:29.620 --> 19:33.172
I KNEW I WAS NOT GOING TO
BE A COP BEAT, SO I RELIED

19:33.206 --> 19:34.137
ON MY SOCIAL GAME.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.896
YOU KNOW YOU AIN'T
GOING INTO PUBLIC WITH

19:36.931 --> 19:37.517
THAT ON.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.931
I WEAR THIS TO THE GYM.

19:38.965 --> 19:40.827
I DEFINITELY THINK MY
SOCIAL GAME --

19:40.862 --> 19:42.482
LOOK AT ME, GUYS.

19:42.517 --> 19:50.172
-- IS ONE OF THE BEST
IN B.B. HISTORY.

19:50.206 --> 19:52.206
I DON'T WANT AMERICA TO

19:52.241 --> 19:56.931
KNOW WHEN I'M TAKING A
POOP.

19:56.965 --> 20:00.103
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO TAKE
IT FROM THE PERSON WHO IS

20:00.137 --> 20:01.034
HAVING A GOOD TIME.

20:01.068 --> 20:03.586
WHY WOULD YOU NOT TAKE ME
TO VEGAS.

20:03.620 --> 20:08.965
WE COULD BE IN A ROOM FULL
OF WHITE WALLS, AND YOU

20:09.000 --> 20:11.862
COULD ENTERTAIN MY BLACK
ASS.

20:11.896 --> 20:15.827
I KNEW I HAD TO SURROUND
MYSELF WITH ALLIES TO KEEP

20:15.862 --> 20:16.758
ME SAFE.

20:16.793 --> 20:19.896
SO I USED MY CHARM AND
PERSONALITY TO START

20:19.931 --> 20:22.689
BUILDING THOSE CONNECTIONS
ON DAY ONE.

20:22.724 --> 20:27.344
FRENCHIE, WHO
DO YOU CHOOSE?

20:27.379 --> 20:29.965
DEREK, YOU REMIND ME OF
MY BEST FRIEND.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.620
AND CONGRATULATIONS TO THE

20:31.655 --> 20:33.758
JOKERS.

20:33.793 --> 20:34.827
THE JOKERS HAVE WON.

20:34.862 --> 20:39.344
AFTER HE WON THE FIRST
H.O.H., WE MADE A FINAL

20:39.379 --> 20:40.310
TWO DEAL.

20:40.344 --> 20:42.137
ME AND YOU, ARE WE
GOING TO DO THIS, LIKE

20:42.172 --> 20:42.551
FINAL TWO?

20:42.586 --> 20:43.517
YES.

20:43.551 --> 20:45.931
I ALSO MADE A FINAL TWO
DEAL WITH XAVIER.

20:45.965 --> 20:48.551
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
I TRUST COMPLETELY

20:48.586 --> 20:50.724
ASSOCIATION I'M GOING TO
DO WHATEVER YOU TELL ME TO

20:50.758 --> 20:51.896
DO.

20:51.931 --> 20:53.758
ME AND YOU HAVE THE FINAL
TWO.

20:53.793 --> 20:56.172
AND I HAD A FINAL TWO
WITH KYLAND.

20:56.206 --> 20:58.413
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
WANT A FINAL TWO.

20:58.448 --> 20:59.551
I'M DOWN WITH IT.

20:59.586 --> 21:03.034
IT IS NOT THAT I
THOUGHT THESE GUYS WERE

21:03.068 --> 21:06.172
SEXY, AND I DO, BUT I KNEW
THEY WERE GOING TO BE BIG

21:06.206 --> 21:09.758
COMPETITORS IN THIS GAME,
SO I WANTED THEM ON MY

21:09.793 --> 21:10.689
SIDE.

21:10.724 --> 21:12.931
BUT THE STRONGEST
RELATIONSHIP I MADE THIS

21:12.965 --> 21:15.586
SUMMER IS WITH MY BEST
FRIEND AZAH.

21:15.620 --> 21:19.482
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
AND I NEED TO REMEMBER

21:19.517 --> 21:20.620
THAT.

21:20.655 --> 21:25.482
I CAN'T PICK SOME RANDOM
DUDE OVER SOMEONE I

21:25.517 --> 21:27.931
LITERALLY DEVELOPED A
CLOSE FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL

21:27.965 --> 21:29.413
LAST ME THE REST OF MY
LIFE.

21:29.448 --> 21:31.482
I LOVE YOU.

21:31.517 --> 21:37.034
OH, MY GOR GOSH, I HATE
HAVING A FAT ASS.

21:37.068 --> 21:40.689
SO I DIDN'T WIN THE MOST
COMPETITION.

21:40.724 --> 21:43.172
THE CORRECT
WOW.

21:43.206 --> 21:45.241
YOU GOT IT, BIG "D."

21:45.275 --> 21:46.724
YOU GOT IT.

21:46.758 --> 21:49.448
YOU'RE GOOD.

21:49.482 --> 21:55.413
BUT I DIDN'T NEED TO

21:55.448 --> 21:58.413
WIN ANY COMPS BECAUSE I
WAS ALWAYS GOOD WITH THE

21:58.448 --> 21:59.482
PERSON WHO WON H.O.H.

21:59.517 --> 22:03.655
MY FIRST NOMINATION IS
DEREK "F."

22:03.689 --> 22:06.517
YOU BETTER START
PLAYING.

22:06.551 --> 22:09.896
IF YOU DON'T TAKE THE SHOT
THAT IS NEEDED, IT WILL

22:09.931 --> 22:11.586
COME BACK AND BITE YOU IN
THE ASS.

22:11.620 --> 22:15.551
I CAME IN HERE WITH THE
GOAL TO BE THE FIRST BLACK

22:15.586 --> 22:16.931
WINNER FOR "BIG BROTHER."

22:16.965 --> 22:19.551
I THINK THE GOOD PART
IS THAT WE'RE ALL ON

22:19.586 --> 22:21.000
DIFFERENT THINGS.

22:21.034 --> 22:23.551
SO I FORMED THE COOKOUT
TO MAKE THAT GOAL HAPPEN.

22:23.586 --> 22:25.896
I TALKED TO TIFFANY
ALREADY.

22:25.931 --> 22:29.413
I SAID IT HAS TO BE ALL
P.L.C.s.

22:29.448 --> 22:33.000
DO WE AGREE THIS IS
GOING TO BE CALLED THE

22:33.034 --> 22:33.551
COOKOUT?

22:33.586 --> 22:34.655
IS THAT WHAT WE DOING?

22:34.689 --> 22:37.862
MY ROLE IN THE COOKOUT
IS I WOULD PUT THE COOKOUT

22:37.896 --> 22:40.310
TOGETHER, AND ALSO KEEPING
UP WITH THE LIES THAT I'M

22:40.344 --> 22:43.448
TELLING THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE
THE COOKOUT, BUT THEY

22:43.482 --> 22:45.724
NEVER FIGURE OUT WE'RE ALL
WORKING TOGETHER.

22:45.758 --> 22:48.137
I'M HIS TARGET.

22:48.172 --> 22:50.206
I'M TOO MUCH OF A SOCIAL
PERSON FOR HIM.

22:50.241 --> 22:52.689
IF I WAS NOT GOING TO
BE THE FIRST

22:52.724 --> 22:54.724
AFRICAN-AMERICAN WINNER OF
"BIG BROTHER," AT LEAST

22:54.758 --> 22:57.103
THE OTHER FIVE MEMBERS OF
THE COOKOUT HAD THAT

22:57.137 --> 22:57.965
CHANCE.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.517
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US
TO BE HERE.

22:59.551 --> 23:01.344
AND STICK TOGETHER.

23:01.379 --> 23:02.413
CORRECT.

23:02.448 --> 23:06.034
WE BASICALLY RAN THE
HOUSE THIS SEASON WITHOUT

23:06.068 --> 23:08.310
ANYONE EVER CATCHING ON.

23:08.344 --> 23:11.448
FRENCHIE,
BRENT, BRITINI, CLAIRE,

23:11.482 --> 23:14.275
YOU ARE EVICTED FROM THE
"BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

23:14.310 --> 23:18.965
I JUST THOUGHT OF IT,
THE FINAL SEVEN ARE ALL OF

23:19.000 --> 23:19.655
BLACK RACE.

23:19.689 --> 23:21.965
THAT HAS NEVER
HAPPENED.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.793
BUT IT WASN'T ALWAYS
SMOOTH SAILING.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.482
I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO
BRITINI.

23:26.517 --> 23:28.482
WELL, I THINK SHE WANTS
US HERE --

23:28.517 --> 23:29.620
I'LL WAIT.

23:29.655 --> 23:33.379
EVEN THOUGH ME AND
TIFFANY WERE IN THE

23:33.413 --> 23:34.655
COOKOUT --
WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE,

23:34.689 --> 23:37.103
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK
FREELY.

23:37.137 --> 23:39.758
-- WE HAD A HARD TIME
WORKING TOGETHER.

23:39.793 --> 23:44.034
WE ARE NOT ON THE SAME
PAGE, WE AIN'T FROM THE

23:44.068 --> 23:45.896
SAME NOTHING, SO WE'RE
DIFFERENT.

23:45.931 --> 23:49.482
IT GOT TO THE POINT
WHERE I ALMOST ABANDONED

23:49.517 --> 23:50.517
THE COOKOUT ALL TOGETHER.

23:50.551 --> 23:53.586
I DON'T WANT TO WORK
WITH THIS BITCH ANYMORE.

23:53.620 --> 23:54.896
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

23:54.931 --> 23:59.517
DO I LOOK LIKE I HAVE A
CLOWN FACE RIGHT NOW?

23:59.551 --> 24:04.551
I KNOW WE HAD TO STICK
TOGETHER SO WE WOULD GET

24:04.586 --> 24:06.758
TO OUR MISSION.

24:06.793 --> 24:10.103
AND IT WORKED BECAUSE
IT GOT ALL SIX OF US TO

24:10.137 --> 24:11.448
THE END.

24:11.482 --> 24:18.172
ALLOW ME TO BE THE
FIRST TO CONGRATULATE YOU

24:18.206 --> 24:20.793
ON ACHIEVING YOUR MISSION.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.896
AND WHEN WE MADE IT TO

24:22.931 --> 24:27.137
THE FINAL FOUR, MAKING THE
CHOICE TO EVICT KYLAND WAS

24:27.172 --> 24:29.586
MY BIGGEST AND HARDEST
MOVE THIS SEASON.

24:29.620 --> 24:34.448
I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR
SINCE THE BEGINNING, I OWE

24:34.482 --> 24:35.310
NOBODY ANYTHING.

24:35.344 --> 24:38.034
I PLAYED THIS GAME SOLELY
FOR MYSELF.

24:38.068 --> 24:43.551
SO AT THIS POINT I CAST MY
VOTE TO EVICT KYLAND.

24:43.586 --> 24:45.724
IT IS
OFFICIAL, KYLAND.

24:45.758 --> 24:50.034
BECAUSE OF MY PERSONAL
RELATIONSHIP, I AM PER

24:50.068 --> 24:55.448
APERFECTLY SET UP TO BE IN
THE FINAL TWO CHAIRS ON

24:55.482 --> 24:56.448
FINALE NIGHT.

24:56.482 --> 25:00.586
I'M HAPPY TO MAKE IT TO
THE FINAL THREE, THE

25:00.620 --> 25:02.379
LITTLE HOOD BOY FROM
PHILADELPHIA.

25:02.413 --> 25:06.551
I PLAYED THE PERFECT
SOCIAL GAME, AND I DESERVE

25:06.586 --> 25:10.517
- TO WIN THAT $750
- K MORE
THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE

25:10.551 --> 25:11.620
HOUSE.

25:11.655 --> 25:14.379
HI, DEREK, IT IS ME,
YOUR MOM.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.551
I LOVE YOU AND MISS YOU.

25:15.586 --> 25:16.655
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

25:16.689 --> 25:19.068
I'M NOT JUST PLAYING
FOR MYSELF.

25:19.103 --> 25:21.000
I'M PLAYING FOR MY MOTHER.

25:21.034 --> 25:24.137
I'M SHE GOT AND SHE'S ALL
I GOT.

25:24.172 --> 25:26.793
LOVE YOU, BIG "D"!

25:26.827 --> 25:29.586
SHE HAS ALWAYS HELPED
ME, AND IT IS IMPORTANT

25:29.620 --> 25:34.103
FOR ME TO DO THAT FOR HER.

25:34.137 --> 25:37.275
SO, UM...IT'S TOUGH.

25:37.310 --> 25:40.827
IT'S TOUGH BECAUSE I'M NOT
GOING TO LET ANY OF THESE

25:40.862 --> 25:43.551
BITCHES GET IN THE WAY OF
MY $750K.

25:43.586 --> 25:45.724
MAY THE BEST HOUSEGUEST
WIN.

25:45.758 --> 25:47.551
GOOD LUCK, YOU GUYS.

25:47.586 --> 25:48.689
GOOD LUCK.

25:48.724 --> 25:53.344
UP NEXT...THE
ROAD TO THE $750,000 GRAND

25:53.379 --> 25:57.034
PRIZE BEGINS AT PART ONE

HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
COMPETITION KICKS OFF.

STAY WITH US.

26:10.931 --> 26:13.137

26:13.172 --> 26:17.000
IT IS NOW TIME FOR PART

AND GET THINGS STARTED.

26:20.758 --> 26:21.793
HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

26:21.827 --> 26:22.758
HI, JULIE!

26:22.793 --> 26:25.517

26:28.413 --> 26:29.827

26:34.344 --> 26:37.137

HOUSEGUESTS OF THE SUMMER,

HOLD

26:48.586 --> 26:51.172

SWUNG LEFT AND RIGHT, UP

26:54.793 --> 26:55.758

26:55.793 --> 26:58.482

26:58.517 --> 27:01.724
BOAT BASH AND BE THE LAST

DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND?

27:06.172 --> 27:09.413

27:09.448 --> 27:10.793
YES.

27:10.827 --> 27:11.862
EXCELLENT.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.724
THEN HOLD ON TIGHT BECAUSE
THIS COMPETITION STARTS

27:13.758 --> 27:14.172
NOW.

27:14.206 --> 27:18.103
OH, MY GOSH.

27:18.137 --> 27:25.896
I REALLY WANTED TO WIN

27:25.931 --> 27:27.379
THIS PART ONE H.O.H.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.413
COMPETITION.

27:28.448 --> 27:30.758
IF YOU WIN, YOU CAN SKIP
STRAIGHT TO PART THREE.

27:30.793 --> 27:34.103
IF I DON'T WIN THIS, I'M
HONESTLY AT THE MERCY OF

27:34.137 --> 27:38.034
BIG "D" OR "X," WHO HAVE A
FINAL TWO TOGETHER.

27:38.068 --> 27:41.448
I NEED TO WIN THIS SO I
CAN PUT DESTINY IN MY OWN

27:41.482 --> 27:42.103
HANDS.

27:42.137 --> 27:44.379
OH!

27:44.413 --> 27:47.344
THE RULES ARE PRETTY
YOU JUST HAVE TO

27:47.379 --> 27:51.000
HOLD ON TO THE BOAT FOR
DEAR LIFE, AND THE LAST

27:51.034 --> 27:53.413
PERSON STANDING WILL WIN
THIS H.O.H. COMPETITION

27:53.448 --> 27:56.827
AND GETS ONE STEP CLOSER
TO BEING IN THOSE FINAL

27:56.862 --> 27:57.827
TWO CHAIRS.

27:57.862 --> 28:00.620
I KNOW I'M IN A GOOD
POSITION WHERE IF I DO NOT

28:00.655 --> 28:04.172
WIN THIS COMP, I DO HAVE
XAVIER WHO WILL TAKE ME TO

28:04.206 --> 28:08.448
THE FINAL TWO, AND I ALSO
HAVE AZAH WHO WILL TAKE ME

28:08.482 --> 28:09.793
TO THE FINAL TWO.

28:09.827 --> 28:12.379
BUT IN THIS GAME, YOU HAVE
TO EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

28:12.413 --> 28:15.413
AND I REFUSE TO LEAVE
ANYONE ELSE IN CHARGE OF

28:15.448 --> 28:18.137
MY GAME.

28:18.172 --> 28:19.896
NO!

28:19.931 --> 28:24.137
OH, THAT IS SO COLD!

28:24.172 --> 28:25.241
OH, MY GOSH!

28:25.275 --> 28:29.620
I HAVE TO WIN PART ONE
OF THIS H.O.H. COMPETITION

28:29.655 --> 28:32.034
BECAUSE THEN IT GUARANTEES
I PARTICIPATE IN PART

28:32.068 --> 28:33.965
THREE OF THE H.O.H.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.965
COMPETITION.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.034
WHICH PARTICIPATING IN
PART THREE COULD BE THE

28:36.068 --> 28:39.379
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ME
POTENTIALLY WINNING

28:39.413 --> 28:42.103
$750,000 AND ME LEAVING
WITH NOTHING.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.862
YOU KNOW, I'D BE LYING IF
I SAID THIS COMPETITION

28:45.896 --> 28:48.103
DIDN'T SEEM GEARED TO BIG
"D" AND AZAH.

28:48.137 --> 28:53.551
I MEAN, THEY HAVE KIND OF
BEEN FLOATING THROUGH THIS

28:53.586 --> 28:54.379
GAME.

28:54.413 --> 28:55.758
SO I'VE GOT MY WORK CUT
OUT FOR ME.

28:55.793 --> 29:00.137
I LOVE THIS SHOW!

29:04.275 --> 29:06.137
MY STRATEGY FOR THIS
COMPETITION IS TO KIND OF

29:06.172 --> 29:08.586
FEEL OUT THE MOTION OF THE
BOAT.

29:08.620 --> 29:11.551
I WANT TO KIND OF MAKE
SURE THAT I'M POSITIONING

29:11.586 --> 29:14.586
MY BODY TO THE OPPOSITE OF
WHATEVER WAY THE BOAT IS

29:14.620 --> 29:15.620
LEANING.

29:15.655 --> 29:19.413
THAT WAY I CAN ALWAYS STAY
CENTERED ON THE BOAT.

29:19.448 --> 29:22.206
I THINK MY LONG LIMBS
REALLY HELP IN THIS

29:22.241 --> 29:23.413
COMPETITION.

29:23.448 --> 29:26.448
I'M ABLE TO GRASP AS MUCH
OF THE BOUNCY BOATER AS I BOAT A

29:26.482 --> 29:30.379
CAN WITH BOTH MY TH THIGHS
THESE AND MY ARMS.

29:30.413 --> 29:33.172
THERE IS NO WAY I'M
LETTING GO OF THIS BOUNCY

29:33.206 --> 29:35.931
BOAT.

29:35.965 --> 29:38.586
MY STRATEGY TO STAY ON
THIS BOAT IS TO MOVE MY

29:38.620 --> 29:40.965
WEIGHT AROUND, GET A FEEL
OF THE BOAT, MAKE SOME

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
LOVE TO THE BOAT, REALLY
GET WITH IT.

29:44.034 --> 29:47.793
LET'S REALLY RIDE THIS
BOAT.

29:47.827 --> 29:48.448
YEAH!

29:48.482 --> 29:50.517
DID I SAY IT RIGHT?

29:50.551 --> 29:52.379
IS IT HE-HAW?

29:52.413 --> 29:55.793
IT IS NOT HE-HAW?

29:55.827 --> 29:56.482
IS IT HEY?

29:56.517 --> 30:04.034
WHAT DO THE COWBOYS SAY?

30:04.068 --> 30:05.310
GIDDY UP?

30:05.344 --> 30:09.448
GIDDY UP, PARTNER --
RIGHT?

30:09.482 --> 30:12.620
THE RAIN IS COMING, AND
IT IS FREEZING.

30:12.655 --> 30:19.724
IT'S FREEZING!

30:19.758 --> 30:26.103
AND THEN OUT OF
NOWHERE, HERE COMES A BIG

30:26.137 --> 30:27.034
ASS SHARK.

30:27.068 --> 30:29.724
I AM SCARED.

30:29.758 --> 30:31.000
AAHHH!

30:31.034 --> 30:35.241
SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY
BITING MY BUTT.

30:35.275 --> 30:41.172
MY FEAR IS I'M FAT AND
THERE ARE SHARKS IN THIS

30:41.206 --> 30:42.206
WATER.

30:42.241 --> 30:46.517
I'M BASICALLY BREAKFAST,
LUNCH, DINNER, AND THEIR

30:46.551 --> 30:46.965
DAMN DESSERT.

30:47.000 --> 30:52.517
OH, COME ON!

30:52.724 --> 30:54.965
THE HARDEST PART OF
THIS COMPETITION IS TRYING

30:55.000 --> 31:00.551
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BEST
POSITION YOURSELF SO YOU

31:00.586 --> 31:02.275
CAN'T POTENTIALLY SLIP AND
FALL OFF.

31:02.310 --> 31:06.862
BETWEEN THE WATER AND JUST
THE BOAT ITSELF, THIS BOAT

31:06.896 --> 31:08.310
IS EXTREMELY SLIPPERY.

31:08.344 --> 31:10.931
ONE FALSE MOVE AND YOU GO
CRASHING TO THE WAVES

31:10.965 --> 31:11.620
BELOW.

31:11.655 --> 31:15.172
IS THAT DOUBLE THE
WATER?

31:15.206 --> 31:19.000
YEP.

31:22.206 --> 31:25.689
WHOA!

31:25.724 --> 31:28.310
I AM HOLDING ON FOR
DEAR LIFE.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.034
THIS WATER IS COMING AT ME
AT EVERY ANGLE.

31:31.068 --> 31:34.172
AND THIS BOAT JUST KEEPS
ROCKING.

31:34.206 --> 31:35.448
THAT BOAT IS MOVING.

31:35.482 --> 31:39.000
IF I DON'T GET A GRIP
ON THIS BOAT, THESE SHARKS

31:39.034 --> 31:42.586
ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM A
FULL THANKSGIVING MEAL.

31:42.620 --> 31:47.620
WE'RE GOING TO NEED A
BIGGER BOUNCY BOAT.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.965
OH, MY GOSH!

31:51.000 --> 31:53.068
WHOA!

31:53.448 --> 31:57.551
BIG "D" IS STRADDLING
WHILE HE IS LAYING DOWN,

31:57.586 --> 32:00.241
AND THEN HE IS ALMOST,
LIKE, CRAWLING UP AND DOWN

32:00.275 --> 32:02.896
IT AS IT MOVES.

32:02.931 --> 32:03.827
WHOA!

32:03.862 --> 32:06.413
BUT NEVER QUITE IN THE
RIGHT DIRECTION.

32:06.448 --> 32:11.034
AND THEN HE IS MAKING
THESE NOISES.

32:11.068 --> 32:13.551
AAHHH!

32:13.586 --> 32:15.000
OH, NO!

32:15.034 --> 32:17.275
I GOT IT.

32:17.310 --> 32:23.000
HE SEEMS LIKE HE IS HAVING
A GOOD TIME ON THIS BOAT.

32:23.034 --> 32:26.586
AAHHH!

32:26.620 --> 32:28.724
OH!

32:29.689 --> 32:41.724
OH, I SAW THAT.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.310
NO!

32:46.344 --> 32:49.310
GOOD JOB, BIG "D."

32:49.344 --> 32:52.896
IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING
THAT I DID NOT WIN THIS.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.965
I HELD ON SO LONG.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.206
I REALLY DID TRY.

32:56.241 --> 32:58.862
I'M A LITTLE UPSET BECAUSE
I FELT LIKE I COULD HAVE

32:58.896 --> 33:02.172
HELD ON A LITTLE LONGER,
BUT I CANNOT BEAT MYSELF

33:02.206 --> 33:03.137
UP.

33:03.172 --> 33:04.758
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE
END OF DEREK'S GAME.

33:04.793 --> 33:07.034
I HAVE SO MUCH MORE GAME
LEFT TO PLAY.

33:07.068 --> 33:11.034
SO LET'S GET READY FOR THE
NEXT COMPETITION.

33:11.068 --> 33:14.275
MAN OVERBOARD!

33:14.310 --> 33:16.724
ONE MAN DOWN; ONE MAN TO
GO.

33:16.758 --> 33:21.379
I'VE GOT TO HOLD ON TO
THIS BOUNCY BOAT FOR DEAR

33:21.413 --> 33:23.448
LIFE, AS LONG AS I CAN,
COME HELL OR HIGH WATER.

33:23.482 --> 33:25.517
STAY WITH IT, GUYS.

33:25.551 --> 33:29.103
BIG "D" WIPES OUT, AND
HE IS NOW SWIMMING WITH

33:29.137 --> 33:29.827
THE SHARKS.

33:29.862 --> 33:31.655
SO IT IS DOWN TO ME AND
AZAH.

33:31.689 --> 33:34.689
I'M NOT LETTING GO OF THIS
BOAT UNTIL I'M THE LAST

33:34.724 --> 33:37.896
PERSON STRADDLING IT.

33:47.655 --> 33:50.724
IT'S DOWN TO ME AND
XAVIER FOR THIS FIRST PART

33:50.758 --> 33:53.068
OF THE FINAL H.O.H.

33:53.103 --> 33:57.379
BRING ON THE WATER, BRICK
ON THE WAVES, BRING ON THE

33:57.413 --> 33:58.344
SHARKS.

33:58.379 --> 34:01.000
WHEN THIS BUMPY BOAT RIDE
IS OVER, I'M GOING

34:01.034 --> 34:04.034
DIRECTLY TO H.O.H. PART
THREE.

34:04.068 --> 34:06.241
IT IS DOWN TO ME AND
AZAH.

34:06.275 --> 34:09.241
I DON'T HAVE ANY DEALS
THAT AZAH HAS FOR THE

34:09.275 --> 34:11.517
FINAL THREE, SO I DON'T
THINK SHE HAS ANY

34:11.551 --> 34:13.758
INTENTION OF BRINGING ME
TO FINAL TWO.

34:13.793 --> 34:17.275
SO I HAVE TO FIND SOME WAY
TO HOLD ON TO THIS BOUNCY

34:17.310 --> 34:19.758
BOAT AND OUTLAST AZAH.

34:19.793 --> 34:26.275
STAY WITH IT, GUYS.

34:26.310 --> 34:29.137
I'VE BEEN ON THIS
BOUNCY BOAT FOR A WHILE,

34:29.172 --> 34:31.482
AND I'M STARTING TO GET
SORE.

34:31.517 --> 34:36.034
MY THIGHS ARE HURTING, MY
ARMS ARE HURTING, AND IT

34:36.068 --> 34:38.448
IS GETTING HARDER AND
HARDER AND HARDER TO HOLD

34:38.482 --> 34:40.103
ON, BUT I CAN'T STOP.

34:40.137 --> 34:42.724
I'VE GOT TO KEEP GOING.

34:43.517 --> 34:50.620
STAY WITH IT!

34:50.655 --> 34:56.620
I LOOK OVER AT AZAH,
AND SHE LOOKS ROCK SOLID,

34:56.655 --> 34:58.310
NOT UNCOMFORTABLE AT ALL.

34:58.344 --> 35:02.689
I'M SLIPPING OVER HERE,
AND AZAH LITERALLY LOOKS

35:02.724 --> 35:05.517
LIKE SHE DOES MOST OF THE
TIME IN THE "BIG BROTHER"

35:05.551 --> 35:08.310
HOUSE, CHILLING AND TAKING
A NAP.

35:08.344 --> 35:10.827
MEANTIME, I'M TRYING TO
MANEUVER EVERY WHICH WAY

35:10.862 --> 35:17.482
JUST TO STAY ON THIS DAMN
BOAT.

35:17.517 --> 35:19.620
OH!

35:19.655 --> 35:21.965
FEELING GOOD.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.379
MY MUSCLES ARE SORE, BUT
I'M HOLDING ON FOR DEAR

35:25.413 --> 35:26.448
LIFE.

35:26.482 --> 35:29.620
HOWEVER, THE BOUNCY BOAT
IS SLOWLY STARTING TO VEER

35:29.655 --> 35:30.931
TO THE RIGHT.

35:30.965 --> 35:33.620
AND I FEEL MYSELF
SLIPPING.

35:33.655 --> 35:43.724
I TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND
ADJUST MYSELF.

35:44.793 --> 35:48.000
CONGRATULATIONS, XAVIER,
YOU HAVE WON PART ONE OF

35:48.034 --> 35:49.896
THE FINAL HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION OF

35:49.931 --> 35:51.689
THE SUMMER.

35:51.724 --> 35:54.068
AUTOMATICALLY ADVANCING TO
PART THREE.

35:54.103 --> 35:59.137
THAT MEANS AZAH AND BIG
"D" WILL FACE OFF IN PART

35:59.172 --> 35:59.724
TWO.

35:59.758 --> 36:01.448
I'VE WON PART ONE.

36:01.482 --> 36:04.482
I'VE GOT ONE MORE
COMPETITION WIN AND THEN

36:04.517 --> 36:06.448
I'M SITTING IN THOSE FINAL
TWO CHAIRS.

36:06.482 --> 36:08.758
I'VE GOT THREE WINS IN A
ROW NOW.

36:08.793 --> 36:12.896
IF I MAKE IT FOUR, I FEEL
VERY GOOD ABOUT MY ODDS TO

36:12.931 --> 36:14.793
POTENTIALLY WIN THIS GAME.

36:14.827 --> 36:16.482
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:16.517 --> 36:16.896
GOOD JOB.

36:16.931 --> 36:18.275
THANK YOU.

36:18.310 --> 36:22.827
IT HONESTLY IS CRUSHING
LOSING PART ONE OF THE

36:22.862 --> 36:23.862
H.O.H. COMPETITION.

36:23.896 --> 36:26.758
BUT I KNOW I CAN GO HEAD
TO HEAD WITH BIG "D" IN

36:26.793 --> 36:29.931
PART TWO BECAUSE I'VE BEAT
HIM BEFORE AND I CAN DO IT

36:29.965 --> 36:30.965
AGAIN.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.793
NOW THAT XAVIER HAS
WON, I KIND OF FEEL GOOD.

36:37.827 --> 36:40.793
I HAVE 100% CONFIDENCE
THAT I CAN BEAT AZAH IN

36:40.827 --> 36:43.034
THE NEXT H.O.H.

36:43.068 --> 36:43.827

I WAS SITTING THERE

38:12.103 --> 38:13.379
LIKE THIS.

38:13.413 --> 38:14.724
I GOT THIS.

38:14.758 --> 38:15.827
I'M RIDING THIS THING.

38:15.862 --> 38:18.689
SO FAR EVERYTHING IS
GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.

38:18.724 --> 38:21.413
I WON PART ONE OF THE
FINAL H.O.H. COMPETITION.

38:21.448 --> 38:24.827

CLOSER TO WINNING

38:29.379 --> 38:30.793
$750,000.

38:30.827 --> 38:34.137
I THOUGHT, AZAH IS
GOING TO HATE THIS.

38:34.172 --> 38:36.965
THIS IS NOT AZAH'S THING.

38:37.000 --> 38:40.931
I DON'T LIKE THE COLD,
EITHER, TO BE HONEST.

38:40.965 --> 38:46.344
IT WON'T BE LONG AND
I'M BACK.

38:46.379 --> 38:50.068
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF
THE NEXT COMP.

38:50.103 --> 38:53.344
YOU GOT PART TWO, AND
THEN IF WE GO TO PART

38:53.379 --> 38:54.965
THREE, WE MADE THE FINAL
TWO.

38:55.000 --> 38:55.724
YEP.

38:55.758 --> 38:56.827
I'M GOING TO TAKE IT ON.

38:56.862 --> 39:01.413
I LOST THE COMP, BUT,
HEY, WAS I WINNING THAT

39:01.448 --> 39:02.965
COMP ANYWAY?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.000
HELL NO.

BETWEEN ME AND AZAH FOR

39:09.103 --> 39:10.034
PART TWO.

39:10.068 --> 39:13.379

39:32.689 --> 39:46.517
TWO JOKERS, UM, UM, UM.

39:46.551 --> 39:50.310
ARE YOU KIDDING ME,
AZAH?

39:50.344 --> 39:54.103
ARE YOU SERIOUS, GIRL?

39:54.137 --> 40:00.103
YOU BETTER PRAY THAT
TOMORROW'S COMP IS NOT

40:00.137 --> 40:03.379
SHORT-TERM MEMORY.

40:03.413 --> 40:06.103
I'M REALLY NERVOUS
ABOUT TOMORROW'S COMP.

40:06.137 --> 40:06.931
WHY?

40:06.965 --> 40:10.482
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

40:10.517 --> 40:14.827
IT'S, LIKE, NOW OR NEVER
FOR ME.

40:14.862 --> 40:16.862
YOU HAVE SHOTS, I DON'T.

40:16.896 --> 40:18.965
I'VE GOT ONE SHOT IN THIS
COMP.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.344
WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE
GONE HOME AT THE FOUR?

40:21.379 --> 40:23.068
NO.

40:23.103 --> 40:25.310
I'M JUST SPEAKING MY MIND
HERE.

40:25.344 --> 40:28.896
LISTEN, YOU HAVE COME
THIS FAR.

40:28.931 --> 40:30.551
YOU'RE GOING AGAINST ME.

40:30.586 --> 40:33.413
I DO NOT HAVE A GOOD TRACK
RECORD.

40:33.448 --> 40:34.379

YOU HAVE WON AN H.O.H. AND
YOU L LEAVE ME --

I'M NOT PSYCHING MYSELF
OUT.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.758
IT IS JUST NERVOUSNESS.

40:44.793 --> 40:48.310
I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS
NERVOUS IN THIS GAME EVER.

40:48.344 --> 40:49.965
I'VE GOT TO WIN THIS
COMPETITION.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.931
I HAVE NO DEALS WITH THESE
GUYS.

40:51.965 --> 40:53.275
