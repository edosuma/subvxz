happened, is it?

Ah, and here I was thinking
you came to keep me company.

11:12.000 --> 11:15.166
Look, I know you're
giving it to outside funds,

11:15.250 --> 11:16.250
not on the surface.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.333
It'll get routed around
the world first,

11:18.417 --> 11:20.125
but then it will land
in certain funds,

11:20.208 --> 11:23.917
and suddenly they'll get hot
as Farrah Fawcett in '76.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.250
Don't do it.
One errant e-mail,

11:26.333 --> 11:28.583
one recorded call,
one trade that tracks back

11:28.667 --> 11:30.583
to you--and it's
Hassan chop!

11:30.667 --> 11:32.458
We're done. All of us.

11:32.542 --> 11:34.417
There's no need
for it, bwana.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.000
Satisfy your urges
some other way.

11:37.083 --> 11:38.709
Buy yourself something.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.583
I bought it all
already.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.959
Probably thrown it out.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.875
What about that vintage Cheetah
you've been eyeballing?

11:43.959 --> 11:46.959
Look, this is not a message
I'm born to carry.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.417
It goes against everything
I've built my life on.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.375
But for you, holding back
is essential right now.

11:53.458 --> 11:55.125
You're right about
hiding the money.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.667
That's too dangerous.
What if I didn't?

11:56.750 --> 11:59.792
-I could have Taylor move it,

11:59.875 --> 12:03.625
on-the-books, perfectly legal
disbursements to outside shops.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.375
Bobby--that's right, I'm not
calling you "Mr. President,"

12:06.458 --> 12:07.792
I'm calling you "Bobby"
because I've never used

12:07.875 --> 12:10.458
your first name
and I want to underline

12:10.542 --> 12:11.959
how serious this moment is.

12:12.041 --> 12:12.834
You've called me
Bobby before.

12:12.917 --> 12:15.542
Strategic mistake,
but not nearly as big

12:15.625 --> 12:18.166
as the one you're making
if you ask Taylor to do this.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.667
They have nothing
to gain by going along.

12:20.750 --> 12:21.917
They get to keep their
princely fucking job.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.166
If you fire them,
it will look like what it is.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.917
And you can't have it appear
you're illegally meddling.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.125
Especially when you're
illegally meddling.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.333
-My point--
-I get your point.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.542
So you won't take
the two billion?

12:35.625 --> 12:36.542
I get your point.

12:36.625 --> 12:39.750
Let's leave it at that.

12:41.709 --> 12:42.917
Ah!

12:43.000 --> 12:45.709
If it isn't George and Edward.

12:45.792 --> 12:48.417
Which one of you will give up
the throne for love?

12:48.500 --> 12:50.125
That seems like
a stupid reason.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.500
You must be George.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.667
Are you coming to our
game later, Uncle Wags?

12:53.750 --> 12:55.166
Is it official
Little League?

12:55.250 --> 12:57.875
-Yeah.
-Can't. Banned for life.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.667
Well, here we are on
the Axelrod case together,

13:03.750 --> 13:07.834
so, you know, we got our
fairy tale ending after all.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.834
You been working out? You look
like you've been working out.

13:09.917 --> 13:12.834
There's no good way
to answer that question.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.917
Is it ping pong?
You back at the tables?

13:15.000 --> 13:16.792
Uh, can I get a lawyer?

13:22.750 --> 13:26.000
Excuse me,
Ms. Gonzalez--

13:26.083 --> 13:28.041
Special Agent
Terri McCue, FBI.

13:28.125 --> 13:31.166
Uh,
me llamo Bryan Connerty,

13:31.250 --> 13:33.709
uh, Federal prosecutor.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.041
He's also
second alternate

13:35.125 --> 13:37.041
at the World Table Tennis
Championships.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.333
I'm really not...
that good.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.000
Ms. Gonzalez, we don't care
about your immigration status.

13:42.083 --> 13:43.375
That's not what we do.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.208
We may even be able to help you
if you cooperate with us.

13:46.291 --> 13:48.041
We want to speak to you about
your boss, Victor Mateo.

13:48.125 --> 13:51.208
Mr. Victor,
he's very good.

13:51.291 --> 13:52.917
He and his wife,
they sponsor me for

13:53.000 --> 13:54.792
the green card,
so I don't need help.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.583
You're not eligible
for a green card

13:56.667 --> 13:58.375
if you've committed a crime.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.750
A crime?
No. No, no, no.

14:00.834 --> 14:03.375
Let's put it up
on the colortini.

14:07.083 --> 14:11.166
That couple near you snapping
selfies were undercover agents.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.250
Mr. Victor
made me do it.

14:13.333 --> 14:17.583
Did Mr. Victor give you
the vial

14:17.667 --> 14:22.041
It was someone else. A woman.
But I know that it was for him.

14:22.125 --> 14:25.542
Him and his wife,
son monstruos.

14:25.625 --> 14:28.041
One time I drop a glass
licorera--Baccarat.

14:28.125 --> 14:33.208
Then Missus, she break the tail
light to my car to punish.

14:33.291 --> 14:36.208
I had to drive home afraid
that I get pulled over

14:36.291 --> 14:37.625
and sent back to Guatemala.

14:37.709 --> 14:39.041
Now I take the bus.

14:39.125 --> 14:42.458
I want to know how it worked.
When and where--

14:42.542 --> 14:44.709
The way that Mr. Victor and his
wife are--I can't be late.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.125
Or do I have
to tell them...

14:47.208 --> 14:48.792
No, no, no. Don't...
don't say anything.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.583
After work, you'll come
to my office

14:51.667 --> 14:55.500
and give a statement.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.875
Lo prometo.

15:02.709 --> 15:05.291
Yeah, what is it?

15:05.375 --> 15:07.250
My maid was late today.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.917
She's never late.

15:12.041 --> 15:16.291
We have a real problem.
We need to meet.

why I'm buying it.

15:29.917 --> 15:32.000
Which is why I'm gonna
let you outbid me.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.375
Thanks.

15:33.458 --> 15:34.917
Sounds like you
want something.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.458
I do.

15:36.542 --> 15:38.166
I want in on

You're raising money for
new ventures, count me in.

15:41.417 --> 15:45.000
Thanks, but I'm not looking
to give up any more equity.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.000
You're saying no
to money?

15:49.083 --> 15:50.709
Look, Axe, let me answer
the question you didn't ask,

15:50.792 --> 15:54.333

15:54.417 --> 15:56.625
I don't want your  money.

-Brazilian sugar and shipping.
-So we buy sugar futures.

But don't bring

19:04.458 --> 19:08.792
Our own foundation was set up
for just these situations

19:08.875 --> 19:11.917
as a kind of emotional

19:44.417 --> 19:45.750
We're on the clock, people.

19:45.834 --> 19:48.709
Now's the time
to earn your paychecks.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.583
There's something
I always wondered:

19:55.667 --> 19:57.083
Why aren't you Charlie?

19:57.166 --> 19:58.166
-Feels like you would have

19:58.250 --> 20:01.417
-been a great Charlie.
-No, I agree.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.291
Oh, Charlie Rhoades, yeah,
that guy's yer best friend.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.375
-Yeah.

20:05.458 --> 20:08.917
Sure. Call ol' Charlie,
see if he can fill in, uh,

20:09.000 --> 20:10.291
as a fourth for tennis
or on a double date

20:10.375 --> 20:14.208
or just ride around
smashing mailboxes.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.625
Yeah. Charlie.
The best.

20:16.709 --> 20:21.417
But in our household,
my father was Charles.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.125
and every now
and then someone,

20:24.208 --> 20:26.166
business associate, the guy who
managed one of his buildings,

20:26.250 --> 20:29.458
who would get just
a little casual,

20:29.542 --> 20:32.000
accidentally let
a Charlie fly.

20:32.083 --> 20:35.291
The world would stop dead.

20:35.375 --> 20:39.208
"Do I look like a fucking
'Charlie' to you?"

20:42.291 --> 20:43.750
And that was that.

20:43.834 --> 20:46.542
The guy would piss himself,
and the day would continue.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.625
So, he was Charles,
and you were Chuck.

20:49.709 --> 20:52.041
And Good Time Charlie
was somewhere else

20:52.125 --> 20:54.792
out on the town
having all the laughs.

20:54.875 --> 20:58.208

20:58.291 --> 21:01.625
Don't I know it.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.542
And how 'bout now?

21:03.625 --> 21:06.542
You just show up in my
chambers for the laughs.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.625
No. No.

21:11.166 --> 21:14.667
I am here in your chambers
to put myself in your debt.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.917
In my  debt.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.834
That's right.

21:17.917 --> 21:21.041
I was thinking back
to our last meal together,

21:21.125 --> 21:23.166
wherein you told me
I ought never mention

21:23.250 --> 21:25.291
the favor I had done you again.
And I promised then,

21:25.375 --> 21:28.375
and I intend to
keep that promise.

21:28.458 --> 21:32.000
And so I am here
to ask of you a favor,

21:32.083 --> 21:35.375
not as repayment to me
but the opposite.

21:35.458 --> 21:38.792
Oh, this must be big.

21:39.959 --> 21:42.375
Judge Funt is stepping
off the Axelrod case.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.959
No one knows.

21:44.041 --> 21:47.542
And when he does, Morgenstern
will make a special appointment

21:47.625 --> 21:52.208
of the judge who convinces
him he most wants the case.

21:52.291 --> 21:56.458
As often as not, that's
the first judge to ask.

21:56.542 --> 21:59.083
And you need
that to be me.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.709
We'll time it out
so it will be.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.792
Now, there are those
that would frame this

22:03.875 --> 22:07.000
as a favor for you,
because it's a marquee case.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.375
But I won't.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.166
You would be
doing me a service.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.208
And all you're asking
is that I be the judge,

22:13.291 --> 22:14.333
not that I rule
in Dake's favor,

22:14.417 --> 22:16.375
not that I'd be slanted
in any way.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.166
That's right.
It's that straightforward.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.875
Win. Lose. Draw.

22:20.959 --> 22:23.917
I want you on that bench because
I know you can't be bought.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.166
You can't be bent.
You can't be worked.

22:26.250 --> 22:27.417
Dake has a strong case.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.500
I want it heard fairly
and without prejudice.

22:33.083 --> 22:35.667
And if I grant
this request...

22:38.333 --> 22:40.083
There is nothing
you can ask me

22:40.166 --> 22:44.875
that I'll refuse you
for the rest of our days.

22:44.959 --> 22:48.458
If I agree, I would
take those words as gospel,

22:48.542 --> 22:52.458
Chuck. And I would
not be bashful to collect,

22:52.542 --> 22:54.583
should the need arise.

22:54.667 --> 22:58.125
I'd be honor bound
to deliver.

22:58.208 --> 23:00.709
That's too small a play.
It won't save us.

23:00.792 --> 23:02.125
Keep looking.

23:06.667 --> 23:09.792
Axe would be out on that
floor screaming at them

23:09.875 --> 23:11.792
like Gordon Ramsay
until they delivered.

23:11.875 --> 23:13.625
Hm. You're more
Alton Brown.

23:13.709 --> 23:15.875
The ideas they're bringing...
Some deployable,

23:15.959 --> 23:18.208
some useful as a benchmark
of what other firms

23:18.291 --> 23:20.375
will be thinking and how
we need to do better,

23:20.458 --> 23:23.750
but none platonically good.

23:23.834 --> 23:25.959
Your first round
of investments coinciding

23:26.041 --> 23:28.750
with your first crisis.

23:28.834 --> 23:30.625
That would be
a lot for anybody.

23:30.709 --> 23:34.458
Axe was already considering
sidecarring two billion.

23:34.542 --> 23:38.458
And you think today will
make the decision for him.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.625
I am acutely aware of
the way people look at me.

23:41.709 --> 23:44.667
I have cultivated, through
achievement and discipline,

23:44.750 --> 23:47.917
a mystique that compensates
for my lack of track record.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.625
A loss shatters that,

23:49.709 --> 23:52.417
and with it the confidence
of everyone who works here.

23:52.500 --> 23:56.000
In their eyes--in Axe's eyes--
I become simply inexperienced.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.000
I can't let that happen.

23:57.083 --> 24:00.000
That's why I need to get
through today unscathed.

24:00.083 --> 24:02.166
The way you
think Axe would.

24:04.333 --> 24:08.875
It's important in your job that
you face unpleasant realities.

24:08.959 --> 24:10.667
Axe Capital may lose money
today,

24:10.750 --> 24:12.083
probably will.

Then how can you ask me not
to be with my troops right now?

25:30.792 --> 25:34.083
Well, Washington was
allowed to talk to his men.

So, you got sick
from Ice Juice.

28:01.834 --> 28:04.125
The person behind its
poisoning was Bobby Axelrod,

28:04.208 --> 28:07.083
the same man you tried
to cooperate against.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.500
You think he
targeted me deliberately?

28:09.583 --> 28:12.875
Wow, that's a long
road to travel for revenge.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.250
But if he did it,
I hope you nail him.

28:15.333 --> 28:18.250
That juice made me puke
so hard I bust a lung.

28:18.333 --> 28:21.500
Hence the swimming.

flat white.

communicating about trades?

31:32.208 --> 31:33.291
What?

31:33.375 --> 31:34.583
That would be illegal.

about the place you work?

run without me.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.208

32:04.792 --> 32:06.834

falls within my dominion,

32:06.917 --> 32:10.667
and the stick can be
really tricky for noobs--

32:12.625 --> 32:15.792
Hmm.

hit off Mozambique.

32:29.083 --> 32:30.709

brought this on.

32:30.792 --> 32:33.500
You knew right then
but you couldn't act.

32:33.583 --> 32:34.667
Maybe you would have
used your experience

32:34.750 --> 32:37.000
to think more globally.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.667

cautious. De-risked.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.083

It's not.

32:42.875 --> 32:45.250
You have
more experience.

32:45.333 --> 32:48.375
You connect points
I don't even know to look for.

32:48.458 --> 32:51.792
I understand how hard it is
to have things inside you

32:51.875 --> 32:53.500
that you can't
communicate.

32:53.583 --> 32:56.542

be to know how to say them

32:56.625 --> 32:57.959
and still not
be allowed to.

32:58.041 --> 33:01.375
And yet,
you are not allowed to.

33:01.458 --> 33:02.500

direct any trades?

33:02.583 --> 33:05.041
The people out there don't
know who they're looking to.

33:05.125 --> 33:08.291
Since it can't be you,
it needs to be me.

33:15.583 --> 33:18.291
If you can't live with that,
I can be the one who leaves.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.792
You'll probably make up
the losses but get yourself

33:20.875 --> 33:22.875
banned for life or worse.

33:25.333 --> 33:27.500

about what to do with it.

33:37.125 --> 33:40.375
And at 1:53 p.m.,

33:40.458 --> 33:43.583
Robert Axelrod...

33:43.667 --> 33:44.291
has left the building.

33:46.500 --> 33:47.500
I'm glad I caught you.

33:47.583 --> 33:49.417
You wouldn't have
if my fucking car guy

33:49.500 --> 33:50.959
could time his job right.

33:51.041 --> 33:54.291
Yeah, George Washington had the
same problem leaving Trenton.

33:54.375 --> 33:55.583
Wags told you?

33:55.667 --> 33:58.250
Texted me while you were
rampaging through the office.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.458
I wasn't rampaging.
I was inspiring.

34:00.542 --> 34:02.125
You know Washington
didn't actually

34:02.208 --> 34:04.625
-Of course.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.583
Structurally unsound, and he'd
have made himself a target.

34:07.667 --> 34:09.959
Yet you worry
about neither.

34:11.917 --> 34:15.917
It's hard to
shut it off, Wend.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.792
I know.

34:17.875 --> 34:21.834
But if you can't, you will
lose the battle and the war.

34:25.792 --> 34:27.375
Do you want me
to come with you?

34:27.458 --> 34:29.083
Stay here with Taylor.

34:29.166 --> 34:32.667
They need some senior
officer for back up.

34:37.417 --> 34:40.208
You're fired.

34:40.875 --> 34:43.458
Find out when Judge Funt's
court is in recess.

34:43.542 --> 34:43.959
Yep.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.250
A Mr. Allerd
is here for you.

34:49.875 --> 34:54.000
I'm Karl Allerd,
your new AUSA.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.875
I think I'd remember if I hired
a new line prosecutor.

34:56.959 --> 35:00.625
Remember when Dake said
there'd be a favor to be named?

35:01.834 --> 35:03.667
Ah.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.375
You're the favor.

35:06.875 --> 35:08.709
You don't trust me.

35:08.792 --> 35:10.500
Hell, I wouldn't
from your chair.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.792
A Spy In the House Of Lords
and so forth. Yes.

35:12.875 --> 35:15.375
So I'll earn your trust.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.333
Will you?

35:16.417 --> 35:17.000
I look forward to
seeing that trick.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.250
That'll be
a neat trick.

35:18.333 --> 35:20.959
Ms. Sacker, our Head of Crim,
will get you situated.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.166
-Mm.

35:22.250 --> 35:22.417
Mm, I will.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.333
Hey, I've been
revising my idea.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.959
There's a division
of a struggling company

35:31.041 --> 35:32.417
in Thailand, that I think--

35:32.500 --> 35:33.291
Wait, is this
the sugar company?

35:33.375 --> 35:35.917
Is it, is this
the same damn deal?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.875
No...It's just
one facet of the company

35:37.959 --> 35:39.875
that I think could be
promising to look into.

35:39.959 --> 35:41.375
It started out as a family
business, and...

35:41.458 --> 35:42.542
-So this is--
this is the same deal.

35:42.625 --> 35:43.458
-Not really--
-Kimmy,

35:43.542 --> 35:48.208
this piece of shit
ain't Axe Cap.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.041
What are you
working on?

36:06.125 --> 36:07.250
Nothing.

36:12.583 --> 36:16.500
I want to see all Ben Kim's
search results for the day.

36:16.583 --> 36:17.959

browser results, or...

36:18.041 --> 36:21.542
Everything
he did today.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.333
Hey, you
on your way home?

36:24.417 --> 36:25.375
Nope.

36:25.458 --> 36:26.375
Chief.
You got to get on your way

36:26.458 --> 36:28.125
if you want to make it
in time to take

36:28.208 --> 36:31.166
the princelings
to Little League.

36:31.917 --> 36:33.750
Have Bruce take 'em.

36:33.834 --> 36:36.583
You got it.

36:47.000 --> 36:48.625
He's been home
three weekends this year.

36:48.709 --> 36:52.458
I'm almost positive one of them
was his assistant's mistake.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.667
And he assumes I never
say anything about him

36:54.750 --> 36:58.417
fucking his way through
the entire New York pool.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.291
But if you can leave Axe...

37:01.375 --> 37:03.875
You give me courage, Lara.

37:06.917 --> 37:09.625
You're smart, Lilly.

37:09.709 --> 37:11.166
You had a career
for a second.

37:11.250 --> 37:14.750
You know your shopper
isn't your friend,

37:14.834 --> 37:17.458
personal trainer doesn't think
you're actually making progress,

37:17.542 --> 37:21.417
and all the charities you give
money to don't actually

37:21.500 --> 37:23.375
honor you when
they honor you.

37:23.458 --> 37:26.291
But on some level,
you believe every bit of it.

37:26.375 --> 37:31.041
You think the attention
you receive is deserved.

37:31.125 --> 37:34.125
But when that fades,
when every relationship

37:34.208 --> 37:37.250
in your life reveals itself
to be a trade on your husband's

37:37.333 --> 37:40.792
net worth, you may say
"Fuck false friends,"

37:40.875 --> 37:42.458
but you'll be hiring
a PR rep the first time

37:42.542 --> 37:47.041
your Halloween costume
isn't mentioned in Page Six.

37:48.583 --> 37:51.250
So keep your
own courage, Lilly.

37:51.333 --> 37:54.333
And while you're at it,
consider keeping that husband.

37:54.417 --> 37:57.166
Because while he may not give
you what you think you want,

37:57.250 --> 38:00.166
he lets you keep on
being Mrs. Keith Currier Smith,

38:00.250 --> 38:02.750
and I'm pretty sure
that's what you need.

38:02.834 --> 38:05.375
Now you're trying
to decide whether

38:05.458 --> 38:06.834
to be pissed
or grateful.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.792
Definitely grateful.

In another, it's just the way

42:37.709 --> 42:39.625
The right Maria Gonzalez came
into this country illegally,

42:39.709 --> 42:44.500
she stayed illegally,
and she committed a fraud

42:44.583 --> 42:47.250
on the stockholders of that
snake-bit juice company.

42:47.333 --> 42:49.709
She is three times illegal.

42:49.792 --> 42:54.667

Can't pull the trigger.

Overseas play?

43:34.583 --> 43:37.250
Ben Kim found
a big opportunity in Thailand.

43:37.333 --> 43:40.125
A troubled public company
with a promising sugar division.

43:40.208 --> 43:42.333
He spotted a good target
but just couldn't quite

43:42.417 --> 43:44.458
figure out how to hit it--
or didn't have the courage

43:44.542 --> 43:45.709
to shoot at it.

43:45.792 --> 43:49.041
We need to keep working
with him on that.

43:49.125 --> 43:50.208
But you see the play?

43:50.291 --> 43:53.166
Yes. A PIPE. Private investment
in public equity.

43:53.250 --> 43:55.291
Basically, we take
ownership of a spin-off,

43:55.375 --> 43:56.375
and a commission
from brokering its sale.

43:56.458 --> 43:59.000
So, why the hesitation?

43:59.083 --> 44:02.000
It will be the single largest
investment I've made as CIO,

44:02.083 --> 44:04.250
and a type Axe Cap
has never made before.

44:04.333 --> 44:07.041
If you make this move, where
do you end up for the day?

44:07.125 --> 44:08.709
Unscathed?

44:11.458 --> 44:14.583
This would
lock in a loss.

44:14.667 --> 44:19.542
Yes. The high-reward plays
are all high-risk.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.250
It's good you can't
run it by Axe.

44:22.875 --> 44:27.458
Forces you to hear
your own voice and trust it.

44:28.667 --> 44:33.291
You'll probably
do the right thing.

44:33.375 --> 44:36.458
And when the day comes you get
one wrong, that'll be good, too.

44:36.542 --> 44:39.000
Because I'll realize I'm mortal
and it's not so bad?

44:39.083 --> 44:40.750
Because it'll be
fucking horrible

44:40.834 --> 44:44.208
and you'll do anything you can
to avoid that feeling again.

44:54.500 --> 44:55.875
Hey.

44:57.834 --> 45:00.166

it's 50-50,

45:10.583 --> 45:13.208

to tell the boys, too.

45:13.291 --> 45:15.625

45:15.709 --> 45:18.750

45:18.834 --> 45:22.625
have to go to work,
and you ditched them.

45:22.709 --> 45:24.875

into Little League.

45:24.959 --> 45:26.458

46:13.458 --> 46:16.000
Judge Funt still has
the case on his docket.

46:16.083 --> 46:19.667
My bag is packed, but I can't
seem to walk out the door.

46:19.750 --> 46:24.291
If I fail at this,
everything is dashed.

46:24.375 --> 46:27.709
For then
I will have ruined myself

46:27.792 --> 46:29.375
in his eyes

46:29.458 --> 46:33.250
and  exposed my position.

46:33.333 --> 46:37.583
Only a fool doesn't
look at the downside.

46:37.667 --> 46:38.750
But only a coward allows
it to dissuade him

46:38.834 --> 46:43.208
from that which he knows
he must do.

46:43.291 --> 46:45.083
I know
you're not a coward.

46:45.166 --> 46:48.834
I don't like the sound of that
word coming out of your mouth.

46:48.917 --> 46:51.208
Neither do I.

46:51.291 --> 46:54.917
I'll see you
at home. After.

47:02.333 --> 47:05.208
Chuck?

47:06.959 --> 47:10.667
No one takes
this shortcut anymore.

47:10.750 --> 47:12.417
This isn't
your courthouse.

47:12.500 --> 47:14.875
Are you lost?

47:14.959 --> 47:19.333
Oh, right where
I need to be, Judge Funt,

47:19.417 --> 47:22.417
which is, unfortunately,
in your way.

47:24.166 --> 47:24.583
Ah.

47:24.667 --> 47:28.083
The Axelrod case.

47:28.166 --> 47:32.375
You had to know a day
like this would come.

47:32.458 --> 47:34.000
I never asked you...

47:34.083 --> 47:35.041
You didn't have to.

47:38.166 --> 47:41.041
Your son's doing
well, I hope,

47:41.125 --> 47:43.250
made the most
of his medical career.

47:45.542 --> 47:47.583
Yeah, he's
a good doctor.

47:47.667 --> 47:49.500
That's what
I wanted for him.

47:51.250 --> 47:54.500
If he hadn't have supplied
those future sons of Hippocrates

47:54.583 --> 47:57.583
with Adderall, some
other med student would have.

47:57.667 --> 48:00.125
I won't let you
dictate my rulings.

48:00.208 --> 48:05.959
The bench cannot be tainted
by personal debts.

48:06.041 --> 48:08.959
Name another favor.

48:09.041 --> 48:11.959
I know that this is the biggest
case that you've ever drawn.

48:12.041 --> 48:14.750
Well, that's something that you
would think about in my shoes,

48:14.834 --> 48:16.625
but I don't.

48:16.709 --> 48:20.583
No, you wouldn't.

48:20.667 --> 48:23.500
And you wouldn't hide
in a hallway waiting

48:23.583 --> 48:25.792
to pounce when I walked by.

48:26.917 --> 48:29.166
But I am not
the man you are.

48:34.208 --> 48:36.792
Oh.

48:36.875 --> 48:39.792
You're not here to ask me
to shade my rulings.

48:39.875 --> 48:43.000
You're here to ask me
to step off it.

48:43.083 --> 48:46.792
It's a hard laydown. And
I'm asking you to lay it down.

48:49.417 --> 48:51.375
Ask yourself

48:51.458 --> 48:54.750
who you
really are, Chuck.

48:54.834 --> 48:57.041
Are you the man that's
reduced to collecting debts

48:57.125 --> 49:01.333
of the soul like--
like old Mr. Scratch?

49:01.417 --> 49:03.709
Well, as with all stories
about that being,

49:03.792 --> 49:07.458
the debt is due, even if,
especially if,

49:07.542 --> 49:11.542
it is not fair or even
right to collect it.

49:13.750 --> 49:18.542
Believe me, my...my insides
hurt making this request.

49:18.625 --> 49:21.333
Oh, I don't believe
that even a little.

49:21.417 --> 49:23.041
You like your insides
just as they are.

49:23.125 --> 49:26.917
You want to be right here,
making these moves.

49:27.000 --> 49:31.333
You need that feeling in your
stomach to know you're alive.

49:33.959 --> 49:37.333
I really think
I am sorry.

49:37.417 --> 49:39.166
Fuck you, Chuck!

49:44.750 --> 49:48.208
I'll recuse myself.

49:50.125 --> 49:52.250
My tab is clear.

50:14.375 --> 50:17.125
and ask for a personal loan?

50:17.208 --> 50:21.125
I just heard DeGiulio is the new
judge on the Axelrod case.

50:21.208 --> 50:23.208
Not our dream judge,
but fair-minded,

50:23.291 --> 50:26.792
likely to hew closely to
the law, rule narrowly.

50:26.875 --> 50:29.250
That'll favor us
a lot more than Funt.

50:29.333 --> 50:31.000
Well, then,

50:31.083 --> 50:33.417
I guess it's a gift.

50:33.500 --> 50:36.291
Chuck.

50:36.375 --> 50:39.166
I know his fingerprints.

50:41.500 --> 50:43.709
Are you gonna do
something about this?

50:43.792 --> 50:46.709
I'm not in the habit
of rejecting gifts.

50:50.041 --> 50:53.333
Do you know about
White Day in Japan?

50:53.417 --> 50:56.792
Over there on Valentine's Day,
women buy presents

50:56.875 --> 51:00.166
for their salarymen bosses,
and those presents are displayed

51:00.250 --> 51:02.250
for all to see, so the most
important thing is the size.

51:02.333 --> 51:06.041
That's how others know
that the recipient is valued.

51:06.125 --> 51:08.959
A month later, on White Day,
the men give a return gift

51:09.041 --> 51:11.250
of two to three
times the value.

51:11.333 --> 51:16.500
So if there's a salaryman
you don't respect,

51:16.583 --> 51:19.041
you get him something
small but expensive.

51:25.125 --> 51:28.166
Chuck just gave you
diamond cufflinks,

51:28.250 --> 51:31.458
and when White Day comes,
you're gonna have to give him

51:31.542 --> 51:34.000
something that costs
a lot more.

Just executed
a huge PIPE.

52:16.917 --> 52:18.375
We're going to arb
a Southeast Asian sugar company.

52:18.458 --> 52:20.667
Fun.

52:20.750 --> 52:22.458
If all my projections hold,

52:22.542 --> 52:25.375
we're still down
five percent overall.

52:25.458 --> 52:26.291
Anyone else would
have lost 12

52:26.375 --> 52:29.417
or done something

52:29.500 --> 52:32.083
Booking the loss
was the only way.

52:34.041 --> 52:36.917
I'm not pulling
the two billion.

52:37.000 --> 52:41.709
It's yours to invest.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.458
I really thought
you didn't trust me.

52:43.542 --> 52:45.000
That's why you
were in the office

52:45.083 --> 52:46.709
looking over
everyone's shoulder.

52:46.792 --> 52:49.250
I was in the office,
because as of now,

52:49.333 --> 52:53.583
I don't know what else
to do with myself.

52:56.166 --> 52:57.250
And...

52:57.333 --> 53:02.000
as much as I can trust anyone
with my name

53:02.083 --> 53:03.709
and my money...

53:03.792 --> 53:06.041
I trust you.

53:06.125 --> 53:07.250
I am irrelevant.

53:07.333 --> 53:10.208
You want the money because you
want the stake, the control.

53:10.291 --> 53:12.959
You need the game
to remember who you are.

53:14.709 --> 53:17.583
I've decided how I'm going
to invest that two billion.

53:17.667 --> 53:21.709
I'm going to diversify,
invest in outside funds.

53:21.792 --> 53:25.125
I'll hear pitches, among them
your hand-picked favorites.

53:25.208 --> 53:26.917
And after I give
them the money,

53:27.000 --> 53:30.250
I'm going to be
a passive investor.

53:30.333 --> 53:32.208
Thank you.

53:39.041 --> 53:41.500
You're not doing this
'cause I need it.

53:41.583 --> 53:43.583
You  need it.

53:44.792 --> 53:49.291
You're giving me a place to play
so I stay off your field.

53:49.375 --> 53:52.417
And you want the benefit
of my moves on our bottom line

53:52.500 --> 53:55.125
in case there's
another disaster.
