[GRINDING]

17:43.556 --> 17:46.256
- LOOK. THIS ISN'T
ROCKET SCIENCE.

17:46.258 --> 17:48.691
OK. SO IT IS ROCKET SCIENCE,
BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

17:48.693 --> 17:52.861
- LOOK. IT'D BE A LOT EASIER
IF YOU'D STOP YELLING AT ME
IN TECHNO LINGO.

17:56.566 --> 17:58.632
- JUST EASE UP
ON THE CYLINDER BYPASS

17:58.634 --> 18:01.567
AND GIVE A LITTLE GAS
TO THE TURBO.

18:03.437 --> 18:04.602
- YAAH!

18:04.604 --> 18:08.038

ENGAGE THE THRUSTER MECHANISM.

WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE?

18:34.096 --> 18:35.795
WHY COULDN'T YOU FLY?

18:35.797 --> 18:39.131
- TAMARANIAN POWERS ARE INCLINED
BY OUR EMOTIONS.

18:39.133 --> 18:42.501
- SO THE WAY YOU FEEL
AFFECTS YOUR ABILITY TO FLY.

18:42.503 --> 18:45.804
- AND RIGHT NOW,
I FEEL UNFAMILIAR CONFUSION.

18:45.806 --> 18:48.973
- BUT WE FACED DANGER BEFORE
WITHOUT YOUR POWERS FAILING.

18:48.975 --> 18:51.709
- IT IS NOT DANGER
THAT CONFUSES ME, ROBIN.

18:51.711 --> 18:56.580
IT IS YOU.
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND US.

18:57.749 --> 19:00.750
EVER SINCE CYBORG
SAID THE "GIRLFRIEND,"

19:00.752 --> 19:02.952
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT BETWEEN US.

19:02.954 --> 19:06.455
- IT'S JUST A MISUNDERSTANDING.
EVERYTHING IS OK.

19:06.457 --> 19:09.291
- EVERYTHING IS NOT OK.

19:09.293 --> 19:10.725
WE ARE NOT OK.

19:10.727 --> 19:13.227
I FEAR WE WILL NEVER
BE OK AGAIN,

19:13.229 --> 19:16.063
AND YOU WILL NOT TELL ME
HOW YOU FEEL.

19:16.065 --> 19:19.800
- UH, I'M NOT VERY GOOD AT THAT.

19:19.802 --> 19:23.536
- DO EARTH BOYS COME
WITH SOME KIND OF MANUAL, THEN?

19:23.538 --> 19:26.272
- THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS EASIER.

19:26.274 --> 19:28.907
- HOW AM I TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ME?

19:28.909 --> 19:35.145
- STARFIRE, I THINK,
UH, IT'S AWESOME

19:35.147 --> 19:37.313
THE WAY YOU SHOOT STARBOLTS.

19:37.315 --> 19:39.281
- YES? AND?

19:39.283 --> 19:42.484
- IT'S ALSO COOL
THAT YOU'RE BRAVE

19:42.486 --> 19:44.586
AND THE STRONGEST GIRL EVER.

19:44.588 --> 19:48.122
- AND YOU DO NOT MIND HAVING
A FRIEND WHO IS A GIRL?

19:48.124 --> 19:50.257

21:14.297 --> 21:15.996
- BUT--

21:15.998 --> 21:18.965

WE'LL BE OK.

21:45.156 --> 21:49.858
- AH! FRIENDS!
IT IS GLORIOUS TO SEE YOU.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.060
- ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE
TO FLY HOME IN THAT?

21:52.062 --> 21:55.396
- JUST MISSING A FEW PIECES,
LIKE ME.

21:55.398 --> 21:58.865
- SOMEBODY IS WAVING AT US...

21:58.867 --> 22:01.267
AND IT'S YOU.

22:02.703 --> 22:04.769
- WELL, ALL RIGHT!

22:04.771 --> 22:06.604
