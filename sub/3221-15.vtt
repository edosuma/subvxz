WEBVTT

00:04.392 --> 00:07.262
Angels gotta have something to do
now that we're post-Apocalypse.

00:07.828 --> 00:10.348
Raphael and his followers,
they want him to rule heaven.

00:10.865 --> 00:13.295
I and many others,
the last thing we want...

00:13.801 --> 00:16.081
- is to let him take over.
- You're talking civil war.

00:16.570 --> 00:18.620
- Balthazar.
- It's so good to see you.

00:19.073 --> 00:22.583
- You stole the staff of Moses?
- I stole a lot of things.

00:23.277 --> 00:25.497
- I need the weapons.
- Don't ask that.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.590
We can beat Raphael.
We can end this.

00:27.982 --> 00:30.502
Tell, uh, Raphael to bite me.

00:32.286 --> 00:33.806
Hey!

00:34.789 --> 00:36.099
No.

00:39.193 --> 00:40.773
- Till next time.
- I gotta make a call.

00:41.162 --> 00:43.302
- I got a cell you can use.
- Not that kind of call.

00:47.301 --> 00:48.531
Yes, Father.

00:48.903 --> 00:50.453
Ruby?

00:51.672 --> 00:52.982
- Ruby!
- Good to see you again.

00:53.340 --> 00:56.180
She's a demon, Sam. Period.
They want us dead, we want them dead.

00:56.744 --> 00:59.024
Look what she did to you.
She's poison, Sam.

01:15.362 --> 01:16.292
Where's Bobby?

01:18.232 --> 01:20.632
- In town. Supply run.
- In this?

01:21.135 --> 01:23.595
Man is a hero.
We are officially out of hunter's helper.

01:27.074 --> 01:28.624
Hello, boys.

01:31.579 --> 01:33.449
<i>- Seen The Godfather, right?
- Balthazar?</i>

01:33.881 --> 01:37.631
When Michael Corleone sends his men
to kill his enemies in one bloody swoop.

01:39.587 --> 01:40.817
Hey.

01:41.255 --> 01:42.925
Dead Sea brine. Good, good, good.

01:43.591 --> 01:47.131
Then Moe Greene gets hit in the eye.
Don Cuneo gets it in the revolving door.

01:47.795 --> 01:49.255
I said, hey.

01:50.431 --> 01:53.361
You did. Twice. Good for you.

01:55.803 --> 01:57.383
Blood of lamb. Blood of lamb.

01:58.439 --> 02:00.899
Yeah. Who keeps their blood of lamb?

02:01.408 --> 02:03.488
Yes. Blood of lamb.

02:03.944 --> 02:06.434
<i>- Why you talking about The Godfather?
- We're in it now.</i>

02:07.148 --> 02:08.198
Tonight.

02:08.515 --> 02:12.706
And in the role of Michael Corleone:
the archangel Raphael.

02:15.322 --> 02:16.782
Mind telling us what you mean?

02:19.193 --> 02:20.863
No, no, no.

02:21.262 --> 02:23.342
No, no, no.

02:26.700 --> 02:27.660
Yes.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.750
Bone of a lesser saint.

02:31.472 --> 02:33.202
This vertebra will do very nicely.

02:33.607 --> 02:37.477
Your Mr. Singer does keep
a beautiful pantry.

02:38.179 --> 02:40.699
- Wait. Raphael is after you?
- Raphael is after us all.

02:41.515 --> 02:45.705
You see, he consolidated his strength
and now he's on the move.

02:46.453 --> 02:47.913
- And where's Cass?
- Oh, Cassie?

02:48.656 --> 02:51.466
He is deep, deep underground.

02:52.326 --> 02:55.226
So good old Raphie put out a hit list...

02:55.796 --> 02:57.756
on every Samaritan
who helped our dear Cass.

02:58.332 --> 03:00.202
Including both of you.

03:00.634 --> 03:02.474
And so much more importantly, me.

03:04.138 --> 03:06.418
See, he wants to draw Cass
out in the open.

03:06.941 --> 03:09.341
- You expect us to just believe you?
- Oh, don't.

03:09.843 --> 03:13.653
- You'll go where I throw you, either way.
- What's that supposed to mean?

03:14.515 --> 03:18.145
And that's all the time we have,
gentlemen.

03:20.688 --> 03:21.858
Where is it?

03:22.189 --> 03:23.389
Oh, what happened there?

03:24.658 --> 03:26.558
Oh, garish, I know.

03:26.994 --> 03:29.514
You see, Uncle Raphie sent
one of his nastiest to handle me.

03:30.030 --> 03:31.260
I'm flattered, actually.

03:31.599 --> 03:34.209
And down a lung, at the moment,
but that's all right.

03:34.735 --> 03:36.165
Here's for you.

03:37.071 --> 03:39.181
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Run with it.

03:46.347 --> 03:47.687
Virgil.

03:48.482 --> 03:50.032
I said run!

03:54.221 --> 03:55.271
Cut!

03:58.525 --> 04:00.775
- Real good solid fall. Way to go.
- Jared, Jensen.

04:01.428 --> 04:03.158
Outstanding. That was just great.

04:04.231 --> 04:08.181
<i>Supernatural, scene one, "Echo."
Take one, tail slate. Marker.</i>

04:23.117 --> 04:24.697
So no angels?

04:26.287 --> 04:27.987
No angels, I think.

04:31.325 --> 04:34.075
- But that was great.
- It's not a problem with the stunt.

04:35.329 --> 04:37.379
It's a problem with the signal.

04:37.831 --> 04:40.991
- Should we be killing anybody?
- I don't think so.

04:41.602 --> 04:42.772
How much did we get?

04:43.103 --> 04:44.563
- Running?
- Where?

04:44.938 --> 04:48.658
Gets us right up to where they...
Just before they hit the window.

04:50.077 --> 04:52.597
The part where they hit the window
was the good part.

04:53.113 --> 04:56.483
We can clean up, reset the window.
Takes about 95 minutes, basically...

04:57.117 --> 05:00.397
so we'd have to blow off the scene
where they sit on the Impala...

05:01.055 --> 05:03.305
- and talk about their feelings.
- Ha! Right.

05:03.924 --> 05:07.294
- You answer the hate mail.
- Or we have them fly at the window...

05:07.928 --> 05:09.448
then freeze frame.

05:09.997 --> 05:12.897
- Then cut to black. Act out.
- Freeze frame.

05:16.003 --> 05:17.553
Um... Yeah.

05:18.105 --> 05:19.885
Freeze frame.

05:22.609 --> 05:24.129
Serviceable.

05:28.082 --> 05:30.482
Fine. Whatever.

05:31.652 --> 05:34.022
Season six.

05:34.988 --> 05:36.008
- Moving on.
- Moving on!

05:36.323 --> 05:37.663
<i>All right, we're done.</i>

05:38.025 --> 05:39.515
That's a wrap on Jared and Jensen.

05:40.027 --> 05:40.987
Who the hell are...?

05:41.295 --> 05:43.985
Jared. Three minutes, okay? Great.

05:46.467 --> 05:47.397
Where are we going?

05:47.701 --> 05:50.601
Jensen, there you are.
Let's just get you in the chair.

05:51.171 --> 05:52.101
The chair?

05:52.406 --> 05:56.946
Okay, hon, we're just gonna
get this makeup off your face.

05:57.745 --> 06:00.905
Whoa, I'm not wearing any ma...

06:03.250 --> 06:05.270
Oh, crap.

06:05.719 --> 06:07.009
I'm a painted whore.

06:07.354 --> 06:11.364
<i>Trish Evian here with Jared Padalecki
from TV's Supernatural.</i>

06:12.993 --> 06:14.453
So, Jared...

06:15.162 --> 06:16.092
season six.

06:19.666 --> 06:21.856
- What?
- You beat the devil, lost your soul...

06:22.336 --> 06:25.296
and got it back again. So tell us,
what's next for Sam Winchester?

06:29.009 --> 06:32.079
- Look, I really don't...
- Include the question in your answer.

06:33.781 --> 06:35.451
- Thanks.
- Heh.

06:36.216 --> 06:37.966
- Cool.
- Thanks.

06:41.221 --> 06:44.411
- Hey.
- Dude, they put freaking makeup on us.

06:45.025 --> 06:46.695
- Those bastards.
- I know what this is.

06:47.094 --> 06:48.294
- What?
- It's a TV show.

06:48.662 --> 06:51.382
- You think?
- Wait, I mean, here, wherever here is...

06:51.932 --> 06:54.422
<i>this Twilight Zone
Balthazar zapped us into.</i>

06:54.935 --> 06:57.075
For whatever reason,
our life is a TV show.

06:58.172 --> 06:59.812
- Why?
- I don't know.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.047
Why would anybody wanna watch
our lives?

07:02.476 --> 07:05.666
Well, I mean, according to the
interviewer, not very many people do.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.860
I'm not saying it makes sense.
We landed in some dimension...

07:09.383 --> 07:11.133
where you're Jensen Ackles...

07:11.552 --> 07:13.452
and I'm something
called a Jared Padalecki.

07:13.887 --> 07:16.787
So, what, now you're Polish?
Is any of this making any sense to you?

07:23.997 --> 07:28.187
Oh. Hey, at least my baby made it.
Ha-ha-ha.

07:30.437 --> 07:32.957
Hey. Hey, what...?

07:40.080 --> 07:41.630
I feel sick.

07:42.416 --> 07:43.996
I'm gonna be sick.

07:45.586 --> 07:48.956
I wanna go home. I feel like
this whole place is bad-touching me.

07:49.590 --> 07:52.840
Yeah, I know. Me too.
So, what do you think? Cass?

07:53.460 --> 07:55.770
It's our best shot, if he's still alive.

07:59.233 --> 08:03.743
Dear Castiel, who art maybe running
his ass away from heaven...

08:04.538 --> 08:06.998
we pray that you have your ears on.

08:08.642 --> 08:10.722
So breaker, breaker.

08:14.982 --> 08:16.322
Cass? Cass. Hey.

08:16.683 --> 08:18.993
Cass. Oh, thank God.

08:19.486 --> 08:21.506
What is all this?
What did Balthazar do to us?

08:26.159 --> 08:29.409
To keep you out of Virgil's reach,
he's cast you into an alternate reality...

08:30.030 --> 08:32.309
a universe similar to ours
in most respects...

08:32.799 --> 08:35.169
yet dramatically different in others.

08:35.836 --> 08:37.645
Like Bizarro Earth, right?

08:38.272 --> 08:40.142
Except instead of having
Bizarro Superman...

08:40.573 --> 08:42.624
we get this clown factory.

08:43.809 --> 08:46.440
Um... Yeah, well...

08:46.980 --> 08:49.120
Anyway, no time to explain.
Do you have the key?

08:49.816 --> 08:53.216
Yeah. So, what does
this thing do anyway?

08:53.854 --> 08:55.604
- It opens a room.
- What's in the room?

08:56.023 --> 08:58.393
Every weapon Balthazar stole
from heaven.

08:59.693 --> 09:02.823
- He gave it to us?
- To keep it safe, till I could reach you.

09:03.430 --> 09:05.740
With those weapons,
I have a chance to rally my forces.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.103
Oh, okay, good.

09:08.535 --> 09:11.285
Yeah. So now, what's the deal
with all this TV crap?

09:12.306 --> 09:13.946
- Pardon?
- Amen, Padaleski.

09:14.341 --> 09:15.301
- Lecki.
- What?

09:15.609 --> 09:16.599
Lecki. I'm pretty sure.

09:17.377 --> 09:19.277
Man, they put out new pages?

09:19.713 --> 09:21.323
- New what?
- Is this a cosmic joke?

09:21.715 --> 09:24.465
- If it is, it's stupid and we don't get it.
- Yeah.

09:25.185 --> 09:26.885
Are you guys okay?

09:27.554 --> 09:29.864
Give me that. What is...?

09:30.724 --> 09:33.334
These are words in a script.
This isn't Cass.

09:33.860 --> 09:36.290
- But look at him.
- You guys wanna run lines or...?

09:36.830 --> 09:38.640
His name is Misha. Misha?

09:39.066 --> 09:41.936
Oh, wow, just great.

09:43.103 --> 09:45.793
Misha? Jensen?
What's up with the names around here?

09:46.340 --> 09:50.060
Oh. You guys, you really punked me.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.370
I'm totally gonna tweet this one.

09:58.885 --> 10:02.045
<i>Hola, Mishamigos.</i>

10:02.656 --> 10:05.786
J-Squared got me good.

10:06.393 --> 10:09.793
I wanna dig my finger into my brain
and scratch it till we're back in Kansas.

10:10.430 --> 10:15.910
Really starting to feel
like one of the guys.

10:17.604 --> 10:18.534
Hey.

10:19.306 --> 10:20.266
J. Ackles.

10:22.275 --> 10:24.205
- That's fake me.
- Yeah.

10:24.911 --> 10:26.201
This must be fake mine.

10:32.285 --> 10:34.865
Dude, I have a helicopter.

10:35.389 --> 10:39.519
Whoa. All right, who puts
a 300-gallon aquarium in their trailer?

10:40.260 --> 10:41.930
Apparently, Jensen Ackles.

10:42.329 --> 10:43.379
Huh.

10:43.697 --> 10:46.417
All right. Here we go.
Let's see who this guy is.

10:46.967 --> 10:49.457
Well, he's not a hunter,
but he plays one on TV.

10:53.507 --> 10:55.967
Oh, come on.

10:57.310 --> 10:59.390
Look at these male-modeling
sons of bitches.

11:00.013 --> 11:01.303
Nice Blue Steel, Sam.

11:01.982 --> 11:03.292
Hey, apparently it's our job.

11:05.052 --> 11:07.922
All right. Here it goes.
Says you're from Texas.

11:08.789 --> 11:10.399
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:10.791 --> 11:11.721
And, uh...

11:13.660 --> 11:15.830
Oh. Says you were on a soap opera.

11:17.864 --> 11:18.764
What?

11:19.066 --> 11:20.176
<i>Well, if I didn't have cancer...</i>

11:20.500 --> 11:23.430
<i>and I wasn't married,
and I had plenty of money...</i>

11:24.938 --> 11:26.608
<i>would you wanna run away
with me?</i>

11:27.207 --> 11:28.377
<i>Money?</i>

11:28.975 --> 11:31.465
<i>You think I care about money?
I care that you're healthy.</i>

11:31.978 --> 11:34.588
<i>Well, I'm no quitter, Eric. I...</i>

11:35.348 --> 11:36.718
Don't like this universe, Sammy.

11:37.084 --> 11:39.274
- We need to get out of this.
- Yeah. No argument here.

11:40.153 --> 11:42.203
But I don't think our prayers
are reaching Cass.

11:42.656 --> 11:44.646
- Or the real Cass.
- Well, I agree.

11:45.092 --> 11:48.112
I think we are definitely out
of soul-phone range but...

11:50.063 --> 11:51.083
What?

11:51.398 --> 11:53.098
If we can reverse Balthazar's spell.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.437
I watched every move.

11:56.603 --> 11:59.183
If we just get the ingredients, right?

11:59.706 --> 12:02.256
Get back to that same window and...

12:06.046 --> 12:07.216
There's no place like home.

12:08.982 --> 12:11.702
Backbone of a lesser saint. Got it.

12:12.252 --> 12:13.922
Uh...

12:15.055 --> 12:16.425
It's rubber.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.490
Check this out.

12:24.431 --> 12:25.451
Hey, look. It's fake.

12:26.366 --> 12:28.236
It's all fake.

12:30.003 --> 12:32.253
Well, at least they're talking
to each other.

12:33.273 --> 12:35.443
What are we supposed to do
with this crap?

12:36.076 --> 12:38.766
Of course, everything is fake.
We're on a film set.

12:39.312 --> 12:42.302
- We gotta get back to the real world.
- Yeah, now you're talking.

12:49.656 --> 12:53.436
All right, we go round up the genuine
articles, bring them here for the spell.

12:54.761 --> 12:56.221
What the hell is going on?

12:57.164 --> 12:59.564
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Mr. Ackles, please.

13:00.066 --> 13:01.586
- Dean.
- Mr. Ackles, please stop.

13:01.968 --> 13:03.258
It's not the Impala.

13:04.771 --> 13:05.761
- You think?
- Please.

13:06.072 --> 13:07.412
It's a freaking prop.

13:07.774 --> 13:09.114
Just like everything else.

13:11.745 --> 13:13.965
Thank you. Thank you so much.

13:15.749 --> 13:17.089
How are we supposed to get out?

13:20.086 --> 13:22.136
You know whereabouts
you want me to drop you off?

13:22.589 --> 13:23.519
Jensen?

13:25.992 --> 13:28.132
Me? Yes. Uh...

13:29.462 --> 13:31.832
I... I'll just tag along with, uh...

13:32.332 --> 13:34.262
- Jared.
- Jared here.

13:34.701 --> 13:37.481
- Since when are you guys talking?
- Yeah, you know what, Clint?

13:38.505 --> 13:39.905
Clif.

13:40.340 --> 13:41.650
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

13:42.475 --> 13:44.495
Clif, obviously.

13:44.945 --> 13:46.905
So I think we're gonna go back
to my place...

13:47.347 --> 13:49.537
and do some work.

13:50.016 --> 13:51.446
- Work on our acting.
- Yeah.

13:51.818 --> 13:54.008
- For our characters. For the show.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

13:54.487 --> 13:55.797
All right. Ha-ha-ha.

13:56.156 --> 13:57.326
Where are we, anyway?

14:04.831 --> 14:06.121
We're not even in America.

14:17.143 --> 14:19.753
Nice modest digs, Jay-z.

14:21.982 --> 14:25.232
Wow. I must be the star of this thing.

14:25.852 --> 14:27.342
Yeah, right.

14:29.055 --> 14:30.365
Check it out.

14:32.225 --> 14:34.885
What am I, Dracula?

14:40.567 --> 14:42.877
George Hamilton Dracula.

14:43.503 --> 14:44.763
Oh.

14:45.572 --> 14:47.152
Now we're talking.

14:58.785 --> 15:00.515
Dude, you have a camel
in your back yard.

15:00.921 --> 15:03.671
It's an alpaca, dumb-ass.

15:06.459 --> 15:07.859
Ruby?

15:17.170 --> 15:20.270
Ruby. Right.
Because that one never gets old.

15:21.174 --> 15:23.044
How was work today, hon?

15:35.855 --> 15:37.605
Wait, you and Ruby?

15:39.926 --> 15:41.886
Do you honestly think that's funny,
Jensen?

15:43.863 --> 15:45.063
Right.

15:45.398 --> 15:47.678
Right. Because you're not Ruby.

15:48.168 --> 15:49.158
You...

15:49.703 --> 15:51.453
I mean, how could you be?

15:51.871 --> 15:53.161
You...

15:53.907 --> 15:57.747
Of course, you are the lovely actress
who plays Ruby.

15:58.445 --> 16:03.515
And you are in Jared's house...

16:04.884 --> 16:08.284
because you two are...

16:10.690 --> 16:11.620
Married.

16:12.525 --> 16:15.185
You married fake Ruby?

16:17.831 --> 16:19.201
What are you doing?

16:19.566 --> 16:21.816
Work. Work. Heh.

16:22.335 --> 16:24.645
- Yeah. Just I thought I'd pop in.
- Say hey.

16:26.439 --> 16:29.539
Hey. And maybe run some lines.

16:30.143 --> 16:32.103
You've never even been to our house.

16:35.048 --> 16:37.978
Well, now that I know there's an alpaca,
I'm definitely coming back.

16:38.551 --> 16:40.891
Well, alpacas are the greenest animal.

16:42.489 --> 16:45.449
Right. Right. That is so important.

16:48.395 --> 16:51.005
Well, there's that thing
I have to get to.

16:51.865 --> 16:54.235
Oh, yeah, of course.
Yeah, the thing...

16:54.734 --> 16:57.754
The International Otter Adoption
charity dinner?

16:58.338 --> 16:59.508
Oh.

17:01.307 --> 17:02.917
Okay, well...

17:05.111 --> 17:08.511
Well, I'm glad you two are talking,
anyway.

17:14.387 --> 17:15.676
Well...

17:16.021 --> 17:18.362
- looks like you did all right.
- Yeah.

17:18.892 --> 17:20.031
Yeah.

17:20.894 --> 17:22.263
I should figure out her name.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.440
"Wrist bone of saint
and holy reliquary.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.563
Museum-quality
from diocese in Oaxaca."

17:30.670 --> 17:31.870
- Looks legit.
- All right.

17:32.205 --> 17:34.695
Auction house is in Mexico City.
Could be there day after tomorrow.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.698
We case it, yank it,
be back here by the end of the week.

17:39.012 --> 17:40.742
- Or we could just buy it.
- What?

17:41.147 --> 17:43.137
Dude, that thing's
over a hundred thou...

17:44.617 --> 17:46.757
Hello, Jared Padalecki.

17:50.457 --> 17:51.447
No.

17:52.959 --> 17:54.599
Triple rush?

17:54.994 --> 17:56.574
No problemo because money is no...

17:59.999 --> 18:01.459
- This baby is maxed.
- Wow.

18:03.069 --> 18:06.059
They said it should be at the airport
first thing in the morning.

18:06.706 --> 18:08.256
Money, man.

18:08.641 --> 18:11.131
There is nothing like it.

18:14.013 --> 18:15.503
All right. Couch.

18:16.649 --> 18:19.719
TV star. Beauty rest.

18:32.565 --> 18:33.525
Hey.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.353
Hey. Hi.

18:35.735 --> 18:38.635
Hi, uh, Gen... Genevieve.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.135
- Gen.
- Gen.

18:40.607 --> 18:43.217
Gen, of course. Yeah.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.990
So how was the otter thing?

18:47.847 --> 18:49.367
- It was good.
- Yeah?

18:49.749 --> 18:51.149
Everybody missed you there.

18:51.584 --> 18:52.814
Oh. Wow. Wow.

18:53.553 --> 18:56.183
I bet.
So listen, I gotta ask you a question.

18:56.856 --> 19:00.696
Do you remember the year before last,
all those disasters?

19:02.228 --> 19:03.278
- Disasters?
- Yeah.

19:03.730 --> 19:05.540
Yeah. The whole earthquake spike.

19:06.900 --> 19:09.360
You know, the 9.2 in Rome.

19:09.869 --> 19:11.949
I mean, the 8.5 outside Boston.

19:12.405 --> 19:15.125
The whole east-west tsunami-chain.

19:16.376 --> 19:22.526
Yes, I remember all of those
from last season on your show.

19:24.317 --> 19:26.597
No, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.276
That's what I mean.
That's what I was talking about.

19:31.591 --> 19:34.521
You have been Sam Winchester
way too long.

19:50.610 --> 19:53.570
So I don't mean to pry, but why
are we picking up packages at 8 a. m...

19:54.147 --> 19:56.047
that haven't cleared customs yet?

19:56.482 --> 19:57.682
Just saving time.

20:01.087 --> 20:03.927
- All right. Here we go.
- Not doing anything illegal, are we?

20:04.824 --> 20:07.544
- Make you feel better if we said no?
- No.

20:17.670 --> 20:20.450
- Whoa, what...? No, no.
- We finish in 12 hours if it kills us all.

20:21.007 --> 20:23.027
Get A and B cam for scene 12.

20:23.476 --> 20:24.526
What is this?

20:25.144 --> 20:27.664
Here for the first run-through
before anyone else?

20:28.815 --> 20:30.835
Dedication.

20:31.451 --> 20:33.761
Can I talk to you for a second? Um...

20:34.988 --> 20:38.768
We're gonna need the set cleared
for, safe side, an hour or so.

20:40.193 --> 20:41.803
- You need it cleared?
- Yeah.

20:42.195 --> 20:46.945
Yeah, me and Jared,
we're gonna do some actor stuff.

20:50.003 --> 20:53.603
Jensen, we're thrilled to see you
collaborating so creatively.

20:54.374 --> 20:56.214
And your enthusiasm is refreshing.

20:56.643 --> 20:58.393
<i>You know,
Dean Cain was like that on Lois.</i>

20:59.112 --> 21:00.422
And that man's a real actor.

21:02.315 --> 21:05.095
And we will clear this set exactly
when we shoot...

21:05.652 --> 21:08.782
the two and three-eighths pages
we are scheduled to shoot on this set.

21:09.889 --> 21:15.129
So you do your actor stuff
and we'll do our camera stuff and...

21:20.566 --> 21:21.876
Ooh. Priority. What's in it?

21:23.870 --> 21:25.980
I bought part of a dead person.

21:27.140 --> 21:28.450
Cool.

21:29.676 --> 21:31.866
Uh... So bad news.

21:33.946 --> 21:36.056
Looks like we're gonna have to do
a little acting.

21:36.516 --> 21:37.446
What?

21:38.518 --> 21:42.858
<i>Supernatural, scene 36, take one.
Marker.</i>

21:45.425 --> 21:46.385
Action.

21:47.060 --> 21:49.280
Balthazar is no hero.

21:49.862 --> 21:52.852
But he knows
Raphael will never take him back.

22:03.876 --> 22:05.216
Cut!

22:07.680 --> 22:10.260
<i>Supernatural, scene 36, take eight.</i>

22:11.050 --> 22:12.540
Marker.

22:14.721 --> 22:15.681
Action.

22:15.988 --> 22:17.688
Balthazar is no hero.

22:18.091 --> 22:21.081
He knows
Raphael will never take him back.

22:34.207 --> 22:35.547
Dean, grimly.

22:35.908 --> 22:38.688
And yet somehow
you got no problem with it.

22:39.245 --> 22:40.145
Cut!

22:42.081 --> 22:43.011
<i>What the hell?</i>

22:45.818 --> 22:47.368
Action.

22:51.724 --> 22:52.654
That's because...

22:55.094 --> 22:57.404
That's because
we have no other choice.

22:59.298 --> 23:00.638
- Don't look at the camera.
- What?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.220
Look anywhere but the camera.

23:09.142 --> 23:11.332
That's because
we have no other choice.

23:11.811 --> 23:14.121
Cut! For the love of...

23:15.314 --> 23:16.774
Action.

23:20.787 --> 23:21.717
Cut!

23:24.023 --> 23:25.753
If there's a key...

23:26.159 --> 23:28.409
then there must also be a lock.

23:28.895 --> 23:30.095
Cut.

23:30.963 --> 23:32.363
Action.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.290
If there's a key...

23:37.003 --> 23:38.433
then there has to be a lock.

23:38.905 --> 23:41.745
And when we find the lock,
we can get the weapons.

23:42.308 --> 23:43.798
Then we can have the weapons.

23:44.177 --> 23:45.927
And the lock.
We'll have a lock, I imagine...

23:46.345 --> 23:48.365
because we opened it
and the key that open...

23:48.815 --> 23:50.185
We need to get all of that crap.

23:50.550 --> 23:52.630
- What? Oh.
- That's how he does it.

23:53.085 --> 23:54.045
Oh, yeah.

23:54.487 --> 23:56.537
Do we really need all these lines?
I mean, I...

23:56.989 --> 23:58.249
I think we've covered it.

23:58.891 --> 23:59.941
- Hey?
- Cut!

24:00.293 --> 24:01.433
What is happening?

24:02.228 --> 24:03.218
What's happening?

24:03.863 --> 24:04.883
What's happening?

24:05.198 --> 24:07.368
An atrocity is happening.

24:07.834 --> 24:09.974
- Seems like they should stop.
- They can't stop.

24:10.436 --> 24:11.636
Nobody stops.

24:13.072 --> 24:14.682
Did we get anything we can use?

24:15.741 --> 24:19.871
Well, technically, we have them
saying everything in bits and pieces.

24:20.813 --> 24:22.563
It could be sort of experimental.

24:23.850 --> 24:25.460
Whatever.

24:26.419 --> 24:27.879
Season six.

24:28.454 --> 24:31.474
Who wrote this?
Nobody says "penultimate."

24:32.058 --> 24:34.518
Gun, mouth, now.

24:36.863 --> 24:39.143
- Moving on.
- Thank God.

24:41.968 --> 24:44.398
I-M-H-O...

24:44.904 --> 24:48.034
J and J had a late one last night.

24:49.609 --> 24:52.629
All right, damn it. We earned this.

24:53.746 --> 24:56.676
R-O-T-F-L-M-A-O.

24:57.250 --> 25:00.180
<i>Spell it out for me, please. What
is our terror alert level here?</i>

25:00.753 --> 25:02.683
I don't know, Sera. Orange maybe?

25:03.122 --> 25:05.752
<i>- They started talking to each other.
- But that's a good thing.</i>

25:06.292 --> 25:07.462
Right. I thought so.

25:07.793 --> 25:09.403
Now Jensen's living at Jared's house.

25:09.795 --> 25:11.965
- Plus, Clif says they're smuggling.
- That's it?

25:12.431 --> 25:13.361
That's it, Toto.

25:13.666 --> 25:16.036
Misha's tweet says
it's a black-market-organ thing.

25:16.669 --> 25:17.899
I'm betting drugs.

25:18.237 --> 25:19.547
Anyway, as far as I can see...

25:19.906 --> 25:22.926
I think they've lost any shred of talent
they ever had.

25:25.912 --> 25:28.192
- Oh, that one hurt.
- Drugs.

25:30.950 --> 25:32.820
Maybe we did it wrong.

25:33.252 --> 25:34.482
No.

25:34.820 --> 25:38.160
No, that spell was perfect.
It should have worked.

25:39.158 --> 25:40.678
What if it can't?

25:41.460 --> 25:43.950
Look, I was up all night,
looking online.

25:44.463 --> 25:48.153
There is no sign that anything
like the Apocalypse happened here. Ever.

25:48.834 --> 25:52.434
And as far as I can tell,
monsters, ghosts, demons...

25:53.105 --> 25:54.125
they're all pretend.

25:55.341 --> 25:57.241
- So nobody is hunting them?
- No hunters.

25:58.311 --> 26:00.391
Maybe that's why our spell didn't work,
Dean.

26:00.846 --> 26:04.186
Maybe here, there's no supernatural,
no magic.

26:05.818 --> 26:09.388
No demons, no hell, no heaven.
No God?

26:10.056 --> 26:11.016
Something like.

26:11.991 --> 26:13.041
Even better...

26:13.859 --> 26:15.589
no angels.

26:39.852 --> 26:41.142
Okay.

26:42.888 --> 26:45.228
Maybe we can't get out
of Earth Number 2 right now...

26:45.725 --> 26:48.215
but the least we can do
is get out of the Canadian part.

26:48.728 --> 26:51.798
If I hear one more conversation
about hockey, I'm gonna puke.

26:52.398 --> 26:54.008
Wait a minute. This way, this way.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.420
No, no, no. It's this way.

26:56.869 --> 26:59.649
- It's this way.
- No, I really think that we should... Dean!

27:00.606 --> 27:02.036
You think you can run?

27:02.908 --> 27:04.018
No!

27:09.548 --> 27:11.888
Sorry, dude. Mojo-free zone.

27:15.321 --> 27:18.041
- No magic in the house.
- Which makes you nothing but a dick.

27:22.595 --> 27:26.105
You know, I oversee all the stunts,
coordinate all the fights.

27:26.932 --> 27:27.892
That's exciting.

27:29.902 --> 27:31.602
Is that one of yours, then?

27:34.607 --> 27:36.067
Guys.

27:39.111 --> 27:40.371
Not good. Not good.

27:42.248 --> 27:44.528
No, no, no.
Stop. You don't understand.

27:45.251 --> 27:46.481
No, no! You are dead, Virgil!

27:46.852 --> 27:49.102
Get off of me! Get back.

27:52.124 --> 27:54.024
- We'll break your freaking neck!
- Die!

27:54.460 --> 27:56.300
<i>I'm trying to understand, Bob.</i>

27:56.729 --> 27:59.599
Well, Sera,
we don't really understand it ourselves...

28:00.166 --> 28:05.966
but it appears that Jared and Jensen
were seen beating an extra to death.

28:06.939 --> 28:08.019
- Huh.
- This is Jim.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.180
It wasn't all the way to death.
Only partway, so that's a plus.

28:11.744 --> 28:14.434
- He could definitely still run.
- And we'll follow up on that...

28:14.980 --> 28:17.120
but I think the real issue here,
Sera...

28:17.583 --> 28:19.193
is that the boys appear to be...

28:19.585 --> 28:22.715
on some kind of extended
psychedelic acid trip.

28:23.589 --> 28:26.929
<i>Okay. Maybe it would help if I...
I'll fly up and talk to them.</i>

28:28.160 --> 28:31.670
You know, I'm not sure
Jared and Jensen know who she is...

28:32.331 --> 28:35.401
strictly speaking.
She's, you know, new. No offense.

28:36.902 --> 28:39.212
<i>- Right.
- Yeah, I think what we might need...</i>

28:39.705 --> 28:43.135
at this stage
is for Kripke to come up himself.

28:44.276 --> 28:46.706
He created this show.
They'll listen to him.

28:47.213 --> 28:50.643
<i>How's that make me look?
I'm supposed to be running this thing.</i>

28:51.283 --> 28:55.123
<i>Besides, Eric's off in some cabin
somewhere, writing his next pilot.</i>

28:55.821 --> 28:57.781
<i>- He sold OctoCobra?
- Yes.</i>

28:58.257 --> 29:01.187
Mother of God. They'll buy anything.

29:01.961 --> 29:04.331
Virgil broke through,
maybe he's got a way to get back.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.170
Or he has no juice here,
and now he's stuck, like us.

29:07.666 --> 29:10.446
Yeah. Either way,
I wanna finish kicking his ass.

29:12.338 --> 29:15.468
- Good night, Misha.
- Night, little fella.

29:32.424 --> 29:36.464
Ever get that feeling...

29:37.730 --> 29:40.950
someone's in the back seat?

29:41.700 --> 29:42.840
Frowny face.

29:45.371 --> 29:46.481
Drive.

29:51.076 --> 29:53.156
There you are, guys.
You got a minute?

29:53.612 --> 29:55.832
- We're looking for...
- That extra you tried to kill?

29:58.450 --> 30:00.000
So is it money?

30:00.386 --> 30:03.696
Is this the kind of act that goes away
if we can scare up coverage on a raise?

30:05.524 --> 30:08.424
More money? You already pay
these two jokers enough as it is.

30:09.028 --> 30:11.458
- Yeah.
- I'd like to think that over these years...

30:11.964 --> 30:13.254
we've grown closer.

30:13.966 --> 30:16.136
That you don't think of me
as Director Bob...

30:16.602 --> 30:18.302
or Executive Producer Bob Singer.

30:19.572 --> 30:21.182
But as Uncle Bob.

30:21.574 --> 30:24.704
Wait, you're kidding. So the character
in the show, Bobby Singer...

30:25.311 --> 30:27.301
What kind of douchebag names
a character after himself?

30:27.746 --> 30:29.206
Oh, that's not right.

30:29.582 --> 30:31.042
Okay, guys, let's begin again.

30:31.617 --> 30:32.637
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:32.952 --> 30:34.502
I don't think Virgil would have
shagged out...

30:34.887 --> 30:38.227
- without getting his mitts on that key.
- Yeah. Yeah, I agree.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.905
Guys. You can't come to work
on poppers.

30:43.863 --> 30:45.793
And smuggle kidneys in from Mexico.

30:46.932 --> 30:48.922
And make up your own lines
as you go.

30:49.368 --> 30:51.558
You cannot make up your own lines.

30:52.071 --> 30:54.471
- Good God, what about your careers?
- You know what?

30:54.974 --> 30:57.604
- Screw our careers, Bob.
- What?

30:58.143 --> 31:00.483
You heard my brother.
That's right, I said brother.

31:01.847 --> 31:04.157
Because you know what, Bob?
We're not actors.

31:04.950 --> 31:05.880
We're hunters.

31:06.518 --> 31:09.478
We're the Winchesters.
Always have been and always will be.

31:10.089 --> 31:12.809
And where we're from,
people don't know who we are.

31:13.659 --> 31:16.289
But you know what?
We matter to that world.

31:17.129 --> 31:19.319
We even saved the son of a bitch
once or twice.

31:19.965 --> 31:22.485
And yeah, okay, here,
maybe there's some fans...

31:23.002 --> 31:25.932
- who give a crap about this nonsense.
- Wouldn't call it "nonsense."

31:26.505 --> 31:28.965
But, Bob Singer...

31:29.475 --> 31:31.085
if that even is your name...

31:31.477 --> 31:33.087
tell me this.

31:33.545 --> 31:34.565
What does it all mean?

31:36.115 --> 31:38.075
Okay. This is good.

31:38.517 --> 31:41.067
I mean, we've all had
our psychotic breaks, right?

31:41.854 --> 31:42.784
I can work with this.

31:43.322 --> 31:45.602
Dean. Virgil. I think he has the key.

31:48.827 --> 31:50.057
We quit.

31:50.396 --> 31:51.656
Yeah.

31:57.169 --> 31:58.809
Okay, okay, okay. Easy, easy.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.730
- How do you do it?
- Please.

32:03.142 --> 32:05.102
Live in this grubby, shabby desert.

32:05.544 --> 32:07.734
Nothing greater than yourselves.

32:08.213 --> 32:10.823
- Nothing but dirt when you die.
- What? Ah!

32:13.919 --> 32:16.259
No power. No magic.

32:16.755 --> 32:19.945
- Please, I'm not following you at all.
- There's no magic in your universe.

32:20.559 --> 32:23.659
- I'm sorry! Please!
- You're nothing...

32:24.263 --> 32:26.343
- but a bag of strings and pulleys.
- What?

32:26.799 --> 32:28.699
You should thank me
for what I'm about to do.

32:29.168 --> 32:31.568
- Why?
- I need to make an important call.

32:32.304 --> 32:34.264
I pray to God
that it even goes through.

32:41.547 --> 32:43.187
This is what I've been reduced to.

32:48.721 --> 32:49.651
Raphael.

32:58.497 --> 33:02.277
- If we get in the police dispatch system...
- Put out an APB on Virgil.

33:02.968 --> 33:05.338
- Might work, if he stays obvious.
- Not like we have time.

33:05.838 --> 33:07.678
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33:08.640 --> 33:11.540
- What?
- Misha. He's been stabbed to death.

33:12.978 --> 33:14.318
- Where?
- Where?

33:14.680 --> 33:15.580
Where?

33:34.366 --> 33:36.536
Yeah, yeah. Raphael.
Like the ninja turtle.

33:37.002 --> 33:39.342
He was calling someone
name of Raphael up in heaven.

33:41.507 --> 33:42.437
Yeah, that's right.

33:42.741 --> 33:45.491
The scary man killed
the attractive crying man.

33:46.045 --> 33:47.915
And then he started to pray.

33:49.481 --> 33:51.441
And the strange part...

33:51.884 --> 33:55.424
after a while,
I swear I heard this voice answering.

33:56.088 --> 33:57.608
What'd it say?

33:58.323 --> 34:01.313
- You know, it didn't make any sense.
- Try us.

34:04.363 --> 34:07.583
The voice said for Virgil
to return tomorrow...

34:08.199 --> 34:11.770
at the place where he crossed over
at the time of the crossing.

34:12.471 --> 34:15.460
Raphael would reach through the
window and take him and the key home.

34:20.179 --> 34:22.399
Okay. Hey, thank you.

34:27.386 --> 34:28.556
Dean.

34:28.887 --> 34:33.107
If Virgil gets back with that key,
Cass is dead and our world is toast.

34:34.493 --> 34:35.922
Well, then we stop him.

34:36.295 --> 34:38.405
I mean, how bad can an angel
with no wings be?

34:46.237 --> 34:48.788
I'd like to see that pump-action tactical,
12-gauge.

34:49.541 --> 34:50.880
You bet.

34:53.512 --> 34:54.562
Nice choice.

34:57.950 --> 34:59.880
You really know your ordnance, mister.

35:00.319 --> 35:01.929
I am the weapons keeper of heaven.

35:02.888 --> 35:03.908
Excuse me?

35:05.457 --> 35:06.417
It's my job.

35:16.301 --> 35:19.611
You know that if we drop Virgil,
get the key...

35:20.405 --> 35:22.925
I mean, this might be it.
We might be stuck here.

35:24.576 --> 35:26.686
No, we'll figure out a way back.

35:28.280 --> 35:31.030
Yeah, you wouldn't be that broken up
if we didn't, though.

35:31.950 --> 35:33.730
What? Don't be stupid.

35:36.555 --> 35:40.245
Well, I'm just saying,
no hell below us, above us only sky.

35:41.827 --> 35:43.527
Dean, our friends are back there.

35:46.865 --> 35:49.115
Yeah, but here,
you got a pretty good life.

35:49.801 --> 35:53.201
I mean, back home, the hits have been
coming since you were six months old.

35:54.773 --> 35:57.463
You gotta admit, being a bazillionaire,
married to Ruby?

35:58.010 --> 36:00.530
The whole package. It's no contest.

36:03.715 --> 36:05.295
No, you know, you were right.

36:06.285 --> 36:07.895
We just don't mean
the same thing here.

36:08.620 --> 36:10.520
I mean,
we're not even brothers here, man.

36:15.794 --> 36:18.314
All right, then.
Let's get our crazy show back home.

36:24.436 --> 36:25.986
Oh, this might be him here.

36:29.575 --> 36:31.715
Bob, dude. What the hell, right?

36:32.177 --> 36:33.697
- Eric. Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

36:34.112 --> 36:35.982
It means a lot
that we can still call on you.

36:36.415 --> 36:38.995
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Misha, right?
- I know. It's just awful.

36:39.518 --> 36:40.948
- Oh, totally awful. Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.040
<i>Got us the front page of Variety, though.
Did you see that?</i>

36:44.623 --> 36:45.963
- Front page? Really?
- Yeah.

36:46.758 --> 36:48.368
- But tragic.
- Yeah, tragic.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.950
<i>- That's what I was gonna say.
- Yeah. How's OctoCobra?</i>

36:51.597 --> 36:55.027
Oh. I think I really had a breakthrough.
Tell you all about it over lunch.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.447
- I can't wait.
- Yeah.

36:58.737 --> 37:02.107
Okay. So I am just gonna
bust in their trailer, guns blazing...

37:02.741 --> 37:04.641
and then take care
of this whole mess and...

37:05.077 --> 37:06.277
What's the matter?

37:06.645 --> 37:08.865
- What?
- That guy. I think that's the extra.

37:09.381 --> 37:11.871
Oh. Fantastic. We can nip this bud
right out of the gate.

37:12.384 --> 37:14.844
Hey! Extra! Over here!

37:15.354 --> 37:17.194
He's got a gun.

37:17.656 --> 37:18.886
No!

37:52.057 --> 37:54.307
I don't think we have gunfire
on the call sheet today.

38:03.235 --> 38:04.465
Hey!

38:21.520 --> 38:22.810
Dean, got it.

38:27.426 --> 38:28.386
Raphael. Run.

38:40.305 --> 38:42.115
You two...

38:42.541 --> 38:44.091
have the strangest luck.

38:46.478 --> 38:47.938
Raphael?

38:49.781 --> 38:51.151
Nice meat suit.

38:52.050 --> 38:53.220
Dude looks like a lady.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.900
The key.

39:00.759 --> 39:03.419
And that will open you a locker
at the Albany bus station.

39:04.363 --> 39:05.323
Really?

39:05.630 --> 39:07.770
I needed a modest decoy
to make it more convincing.

39:08.266 --> 39:11.226
- Give me the weapons.
- Sorry, darling. They're gone.

39:11.803 --> 39:14.463
- What?
- I said, too bloody late.

39:15.407 --> 39:18.917
You see, they were so well hidden
that I needed time to find them.

39:19.578 --> 39:23.328
So I volunteered these two marmosets
for a game of fetch with Virgil.

39:25.417 --> 39:28.257
You two were such an adequate stick.
Thank you. Thank you, boys.

39:28.820 --> 39:30.430
You've made your last mistake.

39:30.922 --> 39:33.382
I've got a few more up my sleeve,
honey.

39:37.863 --> 39:39.353
Step away from him, Raphael.

39:41.032 --> 39:44.132
I have the weapons now.
Their power is with me.

39:48.573 --> 39:49.973
Castiel.

39:52.177 --> 39:54.517
If you don't want to die tonight...

39:55.213 --> 39:56.203
back off.

40:00.419 --> 40:01.379
Well, Cass...

40:05.690 --> 40:08.470
now that you have your sword,
try not to die by it.

40:13.632 --> 40:14.942
Cass, what the hell?

40:17.702 --> 40:21.832
Wait. Wait, you were in on this?
Using us as a diversion?

40:22.574 --> 40:24.504
It was Balthazar's plan.

40:26.278 --> 40:27.708
I would have done the same thing.

40:28.079 --> 40:30.329
That's not comforting, Cass.

40:32.984 --> 40:35.094
When will I be able
to make you understand?

40:35.554 --> 40:39.124
If I lose against Raphael,
we all lose everything.

40:39.791 --> 40:42.661
Yeah, Cass, we know the stakes.
That's about all you've told us.

40:46.231 --> 40:47.461
I'm sorry about all this.

40:51.069 --> 40:52.149
I'll explain when I can.

40:55.006 --> 40:56.846
Frigging angels.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.920
Solid. It's real.

41:19.197 --> 41:20.927
- Nice.
- Yeah.

41:21.333 --> 41:25.433
Yeah. Real, moldy, termite-eaten
home, sweet home.

41:26.605 --> 41:29.265
Chock full of crap that wanna skin you.
Oh, and...

41:31.042 --> 41:32.182
we're broke again.

41:32.978 --> 41:33.908
Yeah.

41:34.646 --> 41:36.016
But, hey...

41:37.148 --> 41:38.488
at least we're talking.
