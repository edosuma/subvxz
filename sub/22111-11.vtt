WEBVTT

00:06.807 --> 00:08.742
NELL: How's the arm?
ERIC: Still a little tender.

00:08.776 --> 00:10.211
You took a pretty hard hit.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.046
Well, we knew the
risks going in, right?

00:12.080 --> 00:15.083
You don't think
it escalated a little quickly?

00:15.116 --> 00:18.586
Well... a place like that can
get very ugly, very quick.

00:18.619 --> 00:21.622
It was a Kmart, Beale,
not a terror cell.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.656
I called dibs.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.458
Everyone knows what that means.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.394
Well, the lady in the fur coat
didn't seem to.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.196
She didn't want the garland,
she wanted the glory.

00:28.229 --> 00:29.197
Eh, debatable.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.799
This is not good.
(sighs)

00:31.832 --> 00:33.334
It's a war zone
out there, Hidoko.

00:33.367 --> 00:35.269
We take what we can get.
What is that doing here?

00:35.303 --> 00:36.804
Spreading some Christmas cheer.
Warming the hearts of many.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.273
No, you need to make it
disappear immediately.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.509
(chuckles)
Okay.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.576
This is your first Christmas
with us.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.544
We should've warned you.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.813
We tend to lean in
to the holidays around here.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.082
Well, I suggest you lean out
before Mosley sees this.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.850
She doesn't allow any type
of holiday display.

00:49.883 --> 00:50.951
ERIC:
Yeah.

00:50.984 --> 00:54.222
Hidoko, if I've met one Mosley,
I've met a hundred.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.790
One glimpse
of this dry desert palm tree,

00:56.824 --> 00:59.593
all lit up with the spirit
of the holidays,

00:59.627 --> 01:03.131
and that reserved, yet often
terrifying shell will crumble

01:03.164 --> 01:04.298
like a Christmas cookie.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.700
I suggest you take a generous
step back, as my friend here

01:06.734 --> 01:09.570
ascribes to the neo-Griswold

01:09.603 --> 01:11.439
school of decorating.
Your flint,

01:11.472 --> 01:12.706
my liege.
Thank you, milady.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.507
I-I really wouldn't do...

01:13.541 --> 01:15.876
Here we go.
(electricity buzzes)

01:15.909 --> 01:18.846
MOSLEY:
Are you kidding me? Hidoko!

01:18.879 --> 01:20.714
Oh.
Tannenbaum.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.316
Come on, come on, come on.
We're just gonna

01:22.350 --> 01:23.584
get this out of here
real quick.

01:23.617 --> 01:25.453
Go, go, go, go!

01:25.486 --> 01:27.455
Abort mission! (yells)
You never saw us.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.129
Do you care to explain?

01:38.766 --> 01:40.768
*

01:56.950 --> 01:59.153
Just as we were starting
to hit it off with Mosley.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.489
Yeah. Yesterday,
she asked me how my sister was.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.357
Last week, she encouraged
me to keep my chin up.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.393
Wait. Isn't that because
you walked into her

02:05.426 --> 02:06.694
while staring down
at your phone?

02:06.727 --> 02:09.363
Can you just let me have this?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.898
Fine.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.900
You know what? This is crazy.

02:12.933 --> 02:14.568
Why don't we just tell her
we caused the power outage,

02:14.602 --> 02:16.604
and that we'll assume
all responsibility?
No.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.806
I'll tell her the
truth. I'm to blame.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.209
If she's gonna punish someone,
she can punish me.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.211
Okay.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.612
Wait, what?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.447
I mean, I don't want to point
fingers or anything...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.915
You're the one who said
it could use more bulbs.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.417
This is a tree. Exactly.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.918
Not the Eiffel Tower, Beale.

02:30.951 --> 02:32.320
Wait.
What?

02:32.353 --> 02:33.621
This is exactly what she wants.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.389
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.524
Screw it. You know what?

02:36.557 --> 02:37.725
We're in this together.
Yeah.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.627
It was a good run.
We'll always have Ops.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.930
There you are.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.266
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.934
HIDOKO:
Okay.

02:46.967 --> 02:48.536
So, the power outage...

02:48.569 --> 02:50.738
Will not be used
to force a wedge between us.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.673
You can take
our Bluetooths.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.275
You can take our jobs.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.343
But you cannot--

02:55.376 --> 02:56.344
ever--

02:56.377 --> 02:57.411
take our bond.

02:57.445 --> 02:58.746
You spent some time

02:58.779 --> 03:00.348
in drama camp, didn't you?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.549
May have dabbled in the arts.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.950
Hmm. Okay, well,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.818
your tree didn't cause
the power to go out.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.220
The grid is down all
over the West Side.

03:06.254 --> 03:07.288
NELL:
Well, that's a relief.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.956
But also not the best news,

03:08.989 --> 03:10.624
because an outage
of that size

03:10.658 --> 03:12.293
will take hours to repair.
Which is why

03:12.326 --> 03:14.262
Mosley wants you guys in Ops
to see what you can do.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.329
All right. Let's go.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.732
Wait. If the power stays out,

03:18.766 --> 03:20.000
Christmas as we know it
will be ruined!

03:20.033 --> 03:21.302
NELL:
Let's go!

03:21.335 --> 03:22.370
"Drama camp."

03:22.403 --> 03:23.904
I get it now.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.343
(knocking on door)

03:30.878 --> 03:32.580
'Sup, brah?
Don't call me brah.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.614
Who are you?

03:33.647 --> 03:34.715
I'm Brady. Finn's cousin.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.350
Finn doesn't have a cousin.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.485
BRADY:
Okay.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.720
You're right. Uh...

03:39.753 --> 03:41.389
Yeah. Finn's not here.
He's not here.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.923
He's in Palm Springs.
He's running an errand,

03:42.956 --> 03:45.025
and with that L.A. traffic,
you know how that can be.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.960
You want to leave
a message or something...

03:46.994 --> 03:48.596
You know, Brady,
I'm getting

03:48.629 --> 03:50.464
a very strong whiff
of something here,

03:50.498 --> 03:52.900
and I'm not talking
about your patchouli.

03:52.933 --> 03:55.369
This was not
in the welcome packet.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.604
Mm-hmm. Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

03:56.637 --> 03:57.705
Honestly, I don't know
what's going on.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.273
Okay, I just got the place
on Airbnb,

03:59.307 --> 04:00.240
I'm renting it for a week.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.343
Finn said that this landlord
was a real drag,

04:02.376 --> 04:04.812
but you seem cool to me.

04:04.845 --> 04:05.913
That's not a compliment.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.281
And you're a horrible liar.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.882
Wait. Well,

04:08.916 --> 04:11.018
if it makes you feel any
better, he lied to me, too.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.020
Apparently "warm and
inviting" is just code

04:13.053 --> 04:14.722
for futon and a bag of Funyuns.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.524
You know what
I'm saying?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.938
You hear that, Hidoko?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.009
This feels like a test.

04:36.043 --> 04:38.979
(inhales deeply)
No, it's no test.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.548
There's nothing to hear.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.416
Sometimes greatness

04:42.450 --> 04:44.418
can be accomplished
in silence like this.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.954
And now this feels
like a TED Talk.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.791
While everybody else in the city
was malfunctioning

04:50.824 --> 04:54.995
without electricity,
I spent a quiet morning

04:55.028 --> 04:57.931
carving "Leucothea"
into a mantel on my boat.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.033
Mortal woman turned protector
of the seas.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.969
Doesn't hurt to know someone
has your back out there.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.538
Speaking of which,
where's Callen?

05:04.572 --> 05:06.039
Marooned somewhere north
of the 10.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.509
Kensi and Deeks?

05:08.542 --> 05:09.810
Stuck on Lincoln. It's gridlock

05:09.843 --> 05:11.111
with all
the traffic lights down.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.013
I'm actually surprised
you got here so quickly.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.382
That's because I swam.

05:14.415 --> 05:17.050
(bells jingling)

05:18.452 --> 05:20.388
What's with the bells?

05:20.421 --> 05:22.456
I always have them in my go bag.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.591
You don't normally

05:23.624 --> 05:25.759
see those
on a survival checklist.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.595
Oh, they're great
for announcing locations,

05:27.628 --> 05:29.563
sending messages
in Morse code,

05:29.597 --> 05:31.465
leading packs of snow dogs.
Needless to say,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.834
you got to see this. Come on.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.769
I think he was trying
to ring out an SOS.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.706
Felt more like he was signaling
Michael Bublé to take the stage.

05:38.739 --> 05:41.341
(laughs)

05:43.143 --> 05:44.445
So what do we got?

05:44.478 --> 05:45.379
NELL:
At approximately

05:45.413 --> 05:47.615
8:42 this morning,
the entire power grid

05:47.648 --> 05:51.419
from the Palisades
to Playa Vista went dark.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.487
Ah. Hot yoga enthusiasts
must be up in arms.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.456
I'm assuming this isn't
a random outage.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.725
Westside Electric reported
an unknown source

05:57.758 --> 06:00.428
gained operational access
to their computer systems.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.731
Seems they are the latest
victims in a ransomware attack.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.865
HIDOKO:
Hackers identify

06:04.898 --> 06:06.066
vulnerability in
the software,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.836
use it to gain access and
then take the system hostage.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.871
Only releasing it
for a fee.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.640
Well, how much
are they asking for?

06:12.673 --> 06:13.507
20 million in Bitcoin.

06:13.541 --> 06:14.742
Hmm.

06:14.775 --> 06:15.776
And if Westside Electric
doesn't comply?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.645
They're threatening
to shut off power up and down

06:17.678 --> 06:19.012
the West Coast
until they do.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.113
Any indication
who's behind this?

06:20.147 --> 06:21.415
NELL:
It seems to have

06:21.449 --> 06:22.616
originated in the Ukraine,

06:22.650 --> 06:25.719
though the exact location
is still yet to be confirmed.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.421
SAM:
Massive outages

06:27.455 --> 06:29.423
like this, they wreak
havoc on infrastructure,

06:29.457 --> 06:31.191
banking systems, hospitals.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.093
MOSLEY: Not to mention
military facilities.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.829
We have backup power. Not
everybody is as lucky as we are.

06:35.863 --> 06:36.897
Which is why DOD

06:36.930 --> 06:39.733
is asking us to treat this
as a terrorist threat.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.935
Right. And with our offices in
the center of the blackout zone,

06:41.969 --> 06:43.203
we need to be sure
that we weren't

06:43.236 --> 06:44.438
the intended target here.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.206
Well, Nell, you catch the
others up to speed.
Mm-hmm.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.576
I'm-a hit Westside Electric.
Jingle Beales.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.176
You're coming with me.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.878
Oh.
(bells jingle)

06:50.911 --> 06:51.945
Leave the bells.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.782
Sam.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.949
Can I bring my gun?

06:55.983 --> 06:57.518
What, you plan on
shaking someone down

06:57.551 --> 06:59.119
over an old utility bill?

06:59.152 --> 07:00.621
People do really crazy things
in the dark.

07:00.654 --> 07:01.889
I should probably
be packing.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.791
The only thing you're packing
is a computer.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.693
Let's go.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.932
MOSLEY: We need to find out
exactly who we're dealing with,

07:11.965 --> 07:14.201
before it's lights out for
the entire western seaboard.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.719
Grid manager will be right out.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.791
So, boats, huh?

07:39.126 --> 07:40.961
(chuckles)
Kids...

07:40.994 --> 07:42.229
Kids are okay?

07:42.262 --> 07:43.831
Eric, what are you doing?
I'm connecting.

07:43.864 --> 07:44.998
The good thing
about a power outage

07:45.032 --> 07:46.466
is you get to disconnect.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.469
Okay.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.107
Aiden and Kam are coming home

07:54.141 --> 07:55.743
tomorrow
for winter break. Okay?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.010
You know what you should do?

07:57.044 --> 07:58.245
You should get a hotel
in the marina.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.581
Make a staycation out of it.

08:00.614 --> 08:01.982
No hotels.
I'm staying on my boat.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.717
All three of you?
All three of us.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.586
The couches double as racks.
Huh.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.588
And they must have fantastic
back support, but...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.122
seems like a bit
of a squeeze, no?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.158
Listen.
That's enough connecting.

08:11.191 --> 08:14.895
All right? And never let me hear
you say "staycation" again.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.029
It's bizarre.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.565
GEORGE:
(clears throat) Gentlemen.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.599
George Forester.

08:18.632 --> 08:19.867
I'm Sam Hanna.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.101
NCIS.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.737
This is...
Eric Beale, uh...

08:23.771 --> 08:25.005
I, uh... You know what?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.540
Lost my badge in the chase.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.576
In the big chase.
Huge, actually.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.309
Sam, you were there.

08:29.342 --> 08:30.878
Surprised you
still have your...

08:30.911 --> 08:32.012
badge.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.113
We should probably
cut to the chase.

08:33.146 --> 08:37.017
A hack of this magnitude
requires a lot of planning.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.086
Did you notice any suspicious
activity leading up to it?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.088
Nothing. We weren't prepared
for anything like this.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.591
Of course, we'd have more time
to work on fixing it

08:43.624 --> 08:45.826
if we stopped getting calls
from every Tom, Dick and Harry

08:45.859 --> 08:47.194
with a stalled train set.

08:47.227 --> 08:49.296
(chuckles)
Okay.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.164
You were the grid manager
on duty this morning?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.332
And for the last 30 years.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.267
Also ten-time
employee of the month,

08:54.301 --> 08:56.069
five-time captain
of the softball team,

08:56.103 --> 08:58.171
two-time winner
of the summer concert raffle,

08:58.205 --> 08:59.807
but now,
I think I'll be remembered

08:59.840 --> 09:02.610
as the one-time destroyer
of the Polar Express.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.744
Well, our best chance
at getting those choo choos

09:03.777 --> 09:04.845
up and running is if we have

09:04.878 --> 09:05.879
full access to
your systems.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.914
Whatever you need.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.015
Would hate
to live in a world

09:08.048 --> 09:10.083
where you can't
illuminate a shrub.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.319
Mm-hmm.

09:12.352 --> 09:16.023
I bet he's fun
at a Yankee swap.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.229
You wanted to see me?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.631
Yes.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.666
Come in.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.767
Do you have a moment?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.637
You bet.

09:29.670 --> 09:30.938
MOSLEY:
Care to explain?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.740
Oh, those are just some, um,

09:32.773 --> 09:34.942
old ornaments that
Hetty had banished

09:34.975 --> 09:36.944
to the island
of misfit decorations.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.212
I found them in the middle
of the courtyard.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.148
I was, uh, just taking them
back to storage.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.684
I must've gotten distracted
with the whole power outage.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.118
Hetty didn't care
for the holidays?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.154
Just those ornaments,
specifically.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.322
She said they reminded her
of a time in her life

09:49.356 --> 09:51.358
when she had lost "Hope."

09:51.391 --> 09:53.260
You know, in our line of
business, I'm sure we can all

09:53.293 --> 09:55.095
recall a time
where we felt like that.

09:55.128 --> 09:55.963
No.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.665
Actually, "Bob Hope."

09:57.698 --> 09:59.166
Something about
a bathtub

09:59.199 --> 10:02.670
full of gin, a promiscuous
Christmas goose

10:02.703 --> 10:04.705
and a USO tour
gone awry.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.306
(both laugh)

10:06.339 --> 10:07.941
That's Hetty.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.010
Do you have an update for me
on the origin of the hack?

10:10.043 --> 10:13.113
Yes. The ransom message
used a Cyrillic character

10:13.146 --> 10:14.882
unique to the Russian alphabet.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.117
A native would not have
made that mistake.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.720
I think that someone's trying to
push us in the wrong direction.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.022
So we still need
to figure out who.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.390
Yes. I could take

10:23.423 --> 10:24.524
Oh, no, no. That's okay.

10:24.557 --> 10:26.994
I'll make sure it gets
exactly where it needs to go.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.729
Okay.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.997
SAM:
Any way to speed this up?

10:30.030 --> 10:31.832
Do I come to your work

10:31.865 --> 10:33.901
and tell you how to arm-bar?

10:34.902 --> 10:37.404
Right. Whoever
did this is advanced.

10:37.437 --> 10:39.206
They bypassed every
security system put into place

10:39.239 --> 10:40.774
to prevent
these kind of attacks.

10:40.808 --> 10:41.809
GEORGE: Red alert--
used car salesmen

10:41.842 --> 10:45.412
are rioting over a string
of deflated Santas.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.513
Whoever did this

10:46.546 --> 10:49.416
had access to every password
at every entry point.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.218
SAM: They knew
the system intimately.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.786
We have an inside threat.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.288
Any of your employees
been acting strange recently?

10:55.322 --> 10:57.825
Look at me.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.126
Multiply this by 20

10:59.159 --> 11:00.794
and ask my entire
department.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.996
Man, we bleed strange.
Anyone familiar

11:03.030 --> 11:04.397
with Eastern European languages?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.199
Yeah, there's this
one guy, Carl,

11:06.233 --> 11:07.167
married a Croatian woman.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.036
And then there's Edgar--
international gamer.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.838
Wouldn't be surprised
if he picked up

11:10.871 --> 11:12.873
some Russian curse words
in a chat room.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.342
We'll start with Edgar.
Where is he?

11:15.375 --> 11:18.045
Not here. He went home
sick this morning.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.780
Not long after
he clocked in.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.483
KENSI: An hour in the car
wasn't enough

11:23.516 --> 11:25.919
to cover this subject?
Let's just say that
I got you a PlayStation.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.888
A PlayStation, a PlayStation.
I don't want a PlayStation!

11:27.921 --> 11:29.056
But if I got you
a PlayStation,

11:29.089 --> 11:31.224
wouldn't you want me
to get you at least a game

11:31.258 --> 11:33.727
to go with said PlayStation?
With the said PlayStation
I don't want?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.162
DEEKS: I'm just talking
hypothetically.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.730
Well, it's coming across
more pathetically.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.131
(sighs) Hidoko,
back me up on this one.

11:38.165 --> 11:39.733
Okay, I've been here
long enough to know

11:39.767 --> 11:40.667
that's not a good idea.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.435
My wonderful fiancée,
who I love dearly,

11:42.469 --> 11:44.071
has made the decree
that this season

11:44.104 --> 11:45.939
we can only give
each other a gift.

11:45.973 --> 11:48.375
Guys, I'd really rather not.
As I explained to Deeks,

11:48.408 --> 11:50.811
we have to save money, because
we have a wedding to plan.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.379
Do you have any idea
how much weddings cost?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.048
I don't spend much time
on Pinterest, so...
A lot!

11:55.082 --> 11:56.784
And plus, Deeks, sweetie,
the holiday season

11:56.817 --> 11:57.918
is supposed
to be spent

11:57.951 --> 11:59.086
with people
that you love.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.854
As well as
the newest electronics

12:00.888 --> 12:02.189
that you also love.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.992
Which I love along with you.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.895
Does couples therapy count
as one gift or two?

12:07.928 --> 12:10.063
Ooh...
(whistles)
Oh, look who's

12:10.097 --> 12:12.199
a comedian.
Then you're gonna love

12:12.232 --> 12:13.466
my next bit.

12:14.835 --> 12:15.869
What's this?
Little gift.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.805
I don't want that.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.840
Possible suspect's name
is Edgar Parsons.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.341
Works for Westside Electric.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.076
Edgar Parsons lives
in Studio City.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.212
Studio City's across town.
That's right.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.815
You want me to spend another
hour in the car, with him?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.850
Should give you plenty
of time to figure this out.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.219
Whatever... this is.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.921
Baby, I just want you to know

12:33.954 --> 12:35.956
that I've read
"The Gift of the Magi,"

12:35.989 --> 12:39.326
and if this ends
with you shaving your head...

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
I may be into that.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.529
NELL:
Callen.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.531
Hey. How's it going
out in the wild?

12:44.564 --> 12:45.498
Not good.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.766
This city is paralyzed.
MAN: What's going on?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.970
We don't fix this quickly, we're
gonna start seeing casualties.

12:50.003 --> 12:51.104
MAN: Move!
How's everything back there?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.239
Oh, great. Now, in addition

12:52.272 --> 12:53.506
to trying to save Christmas,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.408
I now have that fun fact
to process.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.377
If you need a break,
I know a nice little Airbnb

12:57.410 --> 12:58.311
that's just up the coast.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.247
Never took you
as the crowdsourcing type.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.882
Yeah, I'm not.
Turns out Finn

13:01.915 --> 13:04.017
has been renting out
the apartment that he leased

13:04.051 --> 13:06.119
under Dexter Hughes's name
and pocketing the cash.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.320
That's disappointing.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.421
Maybe there's some explanation?

13:08.455 --> 13:11.224
I'd like to hear it,
if I could find him.
Don't worry,

13:11.258 --> 13:12.559
I will track him down faster

13:12.592 --> 13:14.427
than you can say
"en-suite bathroom."

13:14.461 --> 13:16.396
Thank you, Nell.
Oh, and, Callen?

13:16.429 --> 13:19.232
Finn's just a kid--
everyone messes up at that age.

13:19.266 --> 13:20.834
Did you?

13:20.868 --> 13:21.835
Well, almost everyone.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.403
That's what I thought.

13:24.972 --> 13:27.807
(horns honking)

13:29.142 --> 13:30.543
(tires screeching)

13:32.112 --> 13:35.415
* I believe that there's a toy
for every little... *

13:35.448 --> 13:38.018
(knocking on door)

13:38.051 --> 13:39.086
Hi.
Hey.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.253
Oh...

13:40.287 --> 13:41.388
(chuckles):
Well.

13:41.421 --> 13:44.491
They sure know how to target
their audience, don't they?

13:44.524 --> 13:46.259
(laughs)
Oh, my.

13:46.293 --> 13:48.328
You know,
between you,

13:48.361 --> 13:50.430
me and the wall,
all I read is Redbook,

13:50.463 --> 13:51.932
but, uh...

13:51.965 --> 13:54.434
taking a look at that
face, what the hell,

13:54.467 --> 13:56.036
sign me up
for Reader's Digest.

13:56.069 --> 13:57.304
Yeah, we're not
selling magazines.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.539
We're with NCIS.
Oh,

13:59.572 --> 14:01.909
Marilyn, you...
you old so-and-so.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.377
(chuckles)
You know, I just take one look

14:04.411 --> 14:06.579
at those young blue eyes,
and I lose all my wits.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.581
We're looking for Edgar Parsons.
Hold on a second.

14:08.615 --> 14:11.084
Marilyn hasn't had a chance
to take in these cheekbones.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.020
Some call them
"chiseled."

14:13.053 --> 14:13.921
Their words, not mine.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.989
Deeks.
Uh, y-you're looking

14:16.023 --> 14:17.057
for my Edgar?

14:17.090 --> 14:19.192
Yes, your Edgar.
Um... oh,

14:19.226 --> 14:20.360
you know, you
just missed him.

14:20.393 --> 14:22.963
Yeah, h-he's so
busy-- he's always

14:22.996 --> 14:26.066
running around,
doing so many things for me.

14:26.099 --> 14:26.866
You know,
legal things,

14:26.900 --> 14:29.202
of course.
Deeks, we got a runner.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.039
Excuse me. (stammers)
Oh, no, what do you want? Edgar!

14:32.072 --> 14:34.274
MARILYN:
Oh, Edgar!

14:35.042 --> 14:36.276
Oh!

14:36.309 --> 14:37.644
Run, Edgar!

14:41.514 --> 14:44.117
(panting)

14:45.652 --> 14:47.287
(tires screech)

14:50.190 --> 14:50.958
(horn honks)
Hey!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.993
(grunting)

14:54.527 --> 14:56.196
(grunts)

14:56.229 --> 15:00.200
Wow. Talk about
an immaculate reception.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.969
Good catch.

15:02.002 --> 15:05.438
I Odell Beckham'd the heck out
of that thing. I gotcha, buddy.

15:15.715 --> 15:18.418
*

15:18.451 --> 15:20.020
Well, first things first.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.554
The shepherds are
out of surgery,

15:21.588 --> 15:22.689
should be making
a full recovery.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.458
But I think I was goosed
by a Wise Man.

15:25.492 --> 15:28.161
Don't worry,
I tipped him.

15:28.195 --> 15:30.163
Let's just get this over with.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.532
Am I franken-sensing
some hostility?
DEEKS: I'm so confused

15:32.565 --> 15:35.268
by what I'm about to say--
but that was a good one.
Thank you.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.637
Yeah, I did it, okay?
I'm guilty. Take me away.
Whoa. All right.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.372
Lock me up
and throw away the key.

15:39.406 --> 15:41.408
Easy. I didn't even get
to flip the table over.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.076
You know how long
I've been working on that move?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.444
Yeah, a lot of
wasted wrist work.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.146
How long will I get?
Ten years?

15:46.179 --> 15:49.016
Tell me what I have to do
to make it 20.
Okay,

15:49.049 --> 15:51.018
the first thing you need to do

15:51.051 --> 15:52.085
is take a seat.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.054
And start
from the beginning.

15:54.087 --> 15:56.156
Why did you hijack
the power grid?

15:56.189 --> 15:57.524
To feel alive.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.659
Hell, just
to sta alive.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.228
Do you have any idea
what it costs

16:01.261 --> 16:02.996
just to get by these days?
Yeah, you do have

16:03.030 --> 16:04.531
to cut corners if you're
gonna save anything.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.733
All right,
Suze Orman, pipe down.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.436
I'm 30 years old.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.138
I live in my mother's basement

16:11.171 --> 16:14.274
and exercise
to her old Jane Fonda tapes.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.508
We've all been there.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.510
EDGAR:
I haven't been on a date

16:17.544 --> 16:19.679
since Iron Man was in theaters.
Just to clarify,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.681
'cause there's been a lot
of Iron Man movies, which...?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.583
The first one.
Oh.
Oh.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.053
All I ever do is work,
and when I'm not at work,

16:26.086 --> 16:27.487
I'm taking care of my mother.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.756
Trips to the pharmacy,
to the doctors,

16:29.789 --> 16:30.623
to physical therapy.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.692
I had to take out
a second mortgage

16:32.725 --> 16:34.394
just to pay her medical bills.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.163
That's what
the ransom was for?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.330
To pay debts?

16:37.364 --> 16:39.199
'Cause $20 million
seems a little greedy.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.002
There was never gonna be
$20 million.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.772
Didn't care about the money.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.208
They didn't even give me
a bank account number.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.243
Whoa.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.711
So this wasn't your idea--

16:51.744 --> 16:53.146
somebody paid you to do this?

16:53.180 --> 16:56.216
All they cared about
was shutting down the power.
So the ransomware

16:56.249 --> 16:57.384
was just a diversion.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.219
Who hired you?
I don't know.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.621
Some woman I met
at my mom's rehab facility.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.091
"Some woman"?
She offered me 20 grand,

17:04.124 --> 17:05.125
a-and I took it.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.326
I needed that money.

17:08.228 --> 17:09.462
EDGAR:
Check the security footage.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.164
You'll see her.

17:11.198 --> 17:14.167
All right. Your help
will not go unnoticed.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.569
We'll make sure that the
courts show you some...

17:16.603 --> 17:17.837
myrrh-cy.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.339
Huh?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.841
We're gonna go...
workshop that with the elves.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.711
I apologize for my partner.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.214
She did her research.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.681
She knew exactly who to target.
So it was

17:28.715 --> 17:30.383
a distraction-- we need
to figure out for what.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.818
Well, whatever it is,
it has to be

17:31.851 --> 17:33.286
in the radius
of the downed power grid.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.787
God, that's a lot
of ground to cover.

17:34.821 --> 17:35.722
I'll have Nell start with

17:35.755 --> 17:37.090
the high-value properties

17:37.124 --> 17:38.091
in the area.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.859
Greetings, fine people.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.195
Is it me, or is Nell
just Hetty

17:42.229 --> 17:44.097
going all Benjamin
Buttons on us?

17:44.131 --> 17:46.666
(whispers):
Deeks, I am.

17:46.699 --> 17:48.368
Nell, can you contact
the local authorities,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.637
see if there's been reports
of any suspicious activity

17:50.670 --> 17:51.638
around the
power outage?

17:51.671 --> 17:52.739
Oh, I'm already on it.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.107
So far the only reports

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
have been about a stolen lamb

17:56.176 --> 17:57.777
from a residential
nativity scene.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.746
Hmm.
KENSI: All right,

17:59.779 --> 18:01.681
it was cute, it was dirty-- I
was gonna wash it and return it.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.450
Get over it.
Good to know.

18:03.483 --> 18:07.187
There is this
one other thing, and, um,

18:07.220 --> 18:08.855
before I continue,
let me remind you

18:08.888 --> 18:11.524
that it is the holiday season
after all.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.660
That means it's a time

18:13.693 --> 18:16.829
for giving and... forgiving.

18:17.830 --> 18:18.765
You found Finn.

18:18.798 --> 18:20.767
Finn is missing?
"Hiding"

18:20.800 --> 18:21.734
feels more appropriate.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.870
Well, I ran some
of Finn's financial records

18:23.903 --> 18:26.506
that aren't linked to Dexter
Hughes, and it turns out

18:26.539 --> 18:29.609
he is the owner
of a shiny, old van.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.911
Ooh, that's not good.
Vans are notoriously creepy.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.281
It's been ticketed twice
this week in Culver City.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.349
I'm sending you the address now.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.218
Until we meet again.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.387
DEEKS:
Oh, no.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.422
You got "mad dad" face.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.857
I am not his dad,
and I'm not mad.

18:44.891 --> 18:46.226
Mm-hmm.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.461
Would you say that
you've had it up to...

18:48.495 --> 18:50.563
here with him?
(snickers)

18:50.597 --> 18:52.732
Or at least here?

18:54.701 --> 18:56.269
(Callen sighs)

18:58.538 --> 19:00.807
If you killed Eric,
I suggest you cover it up.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.243
I'm not in the mood
for that paperwork.
No, I left him

19:03.276 --> 19:05.612
at Westside Electric-- he needed
to upload some new software.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.846
And I needed to
stop listening

19:06.879 --> 19:08.848
to his Mannheim
Steamroller playlist.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.617
How long until
the power's restored?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.353
Do you want the Eric answer,
or do you have somewhere to be

19:13.386 --> 19:15.388
by New Year's?
(clears throat)

19:15.422 --> 19:16.856
Should be two hours.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.259
Great. I hope it
doesn't take that long

19:19.292 --> 19:21.328
to discover the mystery woman
on the security footage.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.829
I'll check in with
Nell and Hidoko,

19:22.862 --> 19:25.332
see if we can get an I.D.
Well, good luck with that.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.866
Those two have been
acting weird all day.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.401
There's definitely
something up.

19:28.435 --> 19:30.337
Well, the unknown can be
unsettling to people.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.772
You can be a bit
mysterious yourself.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.574
Well, we all put up walls, Sam.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.777
That doesn't mean there
aren't surprises behind them.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.514
Oh!

19:47.820 --> 19:48.855
Oh, geez.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.868
Uh, oh. Okay.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.636
(sighs)

20:03.670 --> 20:05.505
What'd you get
on your SATs?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.274
1580.
Oh, not bad.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.908
Why?
I know what

20:08.941 --> 20:10.410
all my friends got
on their SATs,

20:10.443 --> 20:12.479
so, uh, now it's
official-- we're buds.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.012
Come with me.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.381
Come on.
Nell...

20:14.414 --> 20:15.915
rules are in place
for a reason.

20:15.948 --> 20:16.983
I can't help you.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.286
Oop. Hold that thought.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.995
Hmm.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.230
*

20:39.572 --> 20:41.574
*

21:08.100 --> 21:10.970
Best thing for you right now
would be to not be in here.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.572
Of course, I'm not really
concerned about

21:12.605 --> 21:14.273
what's best for you.

21:15.475 --> 21:17.510
Time to come out.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.515
(lock pops)

21:32.725 --> 21:35.528
HIDOKO: You need to tell me
what we're doing.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.831
Hidoko, where did you spend
the holidays last year?

21:38.865 --> 21:40.099
Stuttgart, Germany,

21:40.132 --> 21:41.868
on assignment
with EUCOM.

21:41.901 --> 21:44.371
We lived off brats
and mulled wine.

21:55.382 --> 21:56.549
NELL:
And the year before that?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.651
Bagram Air Base,
with 1st CAG.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.887
Turned an MRE into
a green bean casserole.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.355
I'll never forget that one.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.523
Well, we don't
always get to

22:03.556 --> 22:05.825
spend the holidays
with our real families.

22:05.858 --> 22:09.396
Sometimes we spend them
with this family.

22:09.429 --> 22:12.399
And this family has
been through a lot lately.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.635
Now, I know the holidays
aren't gonna be the same

22:15.668 --> 22:17.637
without Hetty
and Granger here,

22:17.670 --> 22:20.540
and that is exactly why
we need to remind them

22:20.573 --> 22:22.842
how special it was
when they were.

22:22.875 --> 22:27.146
And we need that tree, Hidoko.

22:27.179 --> 22:29.782
I need that tree.

22:29.816 --> 22:33.686
Okay, well, how do you plan
on convincing Mosley?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.655
I haven't quite figured
that one out, yet.

22:35.688 --> 22:38.458
So, I could use your help.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.092
What do you say?

22:40.126 --> 22:41.127
Okay.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.530
Okay.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.398
(sighs)
With the knees.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.099
Thank you.
(straining)

22:47.133 --> 22:48.568
Okay, you got it?
Yeah.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.428
(tires screeching)

23:15.462 --> 23:18.965
(cackles)
Whoo!

23:21.167 --> 23:22.902
I cannot believe I let you
convince me to do this.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.537
What are you talking about?
We got through traffic

23:24.571 --> 23:25.972
in, like, half the time.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.774
I'm not talking about
the bike, sweetie.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.909
It's Christmas.
You look adorable.

23:29.942 --> 23:32.612
You're like a, like a rare,
but sexy reindeer.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.847
You look like an elf that
feel off one too many shelves.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.917
Oh. You're not wrong
about that.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.787
I'm just gonna leave this here.
It's probably fine, right?

23:40.820 --> 23:42.489
Yeah, all right.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.691
DEEKS: You're lucky
you still have power.

23:44.724 --> 23:45.725
KENSI:
We just need a clear image

23:45.758 --> 23:48.127
of the woman that came in
with Edgar Parsons.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.497
Yeah, we'll be out of your hair
in a hot minute.

23:50.530 --> 23:53.165
Eh, more time I'm in here,
less time I'm out there

23:53.199 --> 23:54.901
with my soon-to-be ex-wife.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.638
She's a nurse.

23:58.671 --> 23:59.939
Oh, well,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.641
not everybody can make
office romance work.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.710
Oh, she can.

24:03.743 --> 24:07.514
But with Dr. Tom, not me.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.854
DEEKS:
Yeah, that's, uh... tough.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.758
She's quite a looker.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.761
That's good for Dr. Tom,
I guess.

24:21.794 --> 24:22.895
SECURITY GUARD:
No.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.631
The woman you're looking for...

24:24.664 --> 24:25.932
That's her.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.071
MOSLEY:
We need to know why this woman

24:32.104 --> 24:33.640
took the power out.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.141
You know her?

24:35.174 --> 24:37.009
That's Alicia Fuentes.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.778
You seem concerned.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.880
She's the sister
of Jose Fuentes,

24:40.913 --> 24:43.049
heir to the second largest
drug cartel in Mexico.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.551
The Morelos cartel.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.085
They've been quiet
for quite some time now.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.621
Jose got locked up
five years ago.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.723
When he went away,
the bloodshed slowed down.

24:50.757 --> 24:52.291
With the kingpin being
locked up,

24:52.324 --> 24:54.627
maybe they used the five years
to prepare the queen.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.796
If Alicia revives
the Morelos cartel,

24:56.829 --> 24:58.064
things are gonna
get loud again.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.932
A lot of people will get hurt.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.034
Well, all I want for Christmas
is for you to find her

25:02.068 --> 25:03.703
before the bodies start to drop.

25:16.315 --> 25:17.383
I leave you alone
for a minute,

25:17.416 --> 25:20.219
and it is lights out for
the entire western seaboard.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.554
You hear that, Hidoko?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.923
The silence is
officially broken.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.024
Okay, if I carried around

25:25.057 --> 25:26.793
a Swiss flag,
would I stop being

25:26.826 --> 25:27.927
caught in the middle
of these things?

25:27.960 --> 25:29.696
Don't let me interrupt
anything here.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.163
Thank you.

25:31.197 --> 25:32.298
Jose Fuentes,

25:32.331 --> 25:33.600
son of Hector Fuentes

25:33.633 --> 25:35.267
and heir to the Morelos cartel,

25:35.301 --> 25:37.303
one of Mexico's most notorious
drug families.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.170
SAM:
DEA picked him up

25:38.204 --> 25:40.607
five years ago
in the City of Industry.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.174
That's right, he was tied
to a linens warehouse

25:42.208 --> 25:44.877
that was doubling as
a cocaine distribution center.

25:44.911 --> 25:46.779
With the heir apparent
behind bars,

25:46.813 --> 25:48.781
it might fall on the sister
to run the family business.

25:48.815 --> 25:49.782
Doesn't seem like it.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.884
Alicia Fuentes has been
clean up until now.

25:51.918 --> 25:53.252
At least in the eyes
of the U.S.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.321
Valid passport,
no arrests.

25:55.354 --> 25:56.623
Not even a parking ticket.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.724
Well five years is
a long time to go

25:57.757 --> 25:58.658
without your brother
footing the bills for things.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.127
Her little nest egg
could have run out.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.062
Well, Kensi and Deeks are
on their way to her house now.

26:03.095 --> 26:04.864
Looks like we'll be
paying Jose a visit.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.666
Where is he now?
He was sentenced

26:06.699 --> 26:08.200
to a federal prison
outside Fresno,

26:08.234 --> 26:10.302
but was transferred to
a private facility last week.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.838
SAM: Which one?
Barnsworth Penitentiary.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.106
That's three miles from here.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.208
They're most likely
on the same power grid.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.977
I'll let them know
you're on your way.

26:19.345 --> 26:20.312
(tires screeching)

26:20.346 --> 26:21.347
(Deeks groans)

26:21.380 --> 26:24.316
Ugh... oh.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.218
I was doing some thinking
on the way over,

26:26.252 --> 26:27.854
mostly about my life, which,
subsequently,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.088
flew by in its entirety.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.357
I agree to your
one-present rule,

26:31.390 --> 26:34.226
as long as you promise to never
drive my bike ever again.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.829
First of all, that woman
cut me off.

26:36.863 --> 26:38.164
Second of all,
please don't be scared.

26:38.197 --> 26:39.231
It does not look good on you.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.233
I'm not scared, but
I'm pretty sure that Pomeranian

26:41.267 --> 26:42.234
died of a heart attack.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.970
(chuckles) Okay, we don't
have a lot of time

26:44.003 --> 26:45.304
to track Alicia Fuentes,
so I'm sorry,

26:45.337 --> 26:46.505
we need to cut corners.

26:46.538 --> 26:48.908
Well, and I have to cut coupons
for the Ubers I'll be taking

26:48.941 --> 26:50.643
from here on out.
Stop being ridiculous.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.745
Stop being Evel Knievel's
understudy.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.814
You know, if I wasn't
so well-adjusted,

26:54.847 --> 26:56.816
I'd almost begin to think
everyone's avoiding me.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.718
Finn's a little kid.
Don't take it personal.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.052
Yeah?
What's your excuse?

27:00.086 --> 27:01.754
What do I have
to do with this?

27:01.788 --> 27:02.989
Christmas dinner?

27:03.022 --> 27:05.091
You haven't responded
to my e-vite.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.358
I don't know what's
more unsettling,

27:06.392 --> 27:07.860
the fact that
you send an e-vite,

27:07.894 --> 27:08.961
or that you're
monitoring it.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.130
I got to know how much
brisket to buy.

27:11.163 --> 27:13.800
Fine. Don't come for dinner.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.001
But do me this favor.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.036
Stay with me while Aiden
and Kam are in town.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.270
I got plenty of room
for everybody.

27:18.304 --> 27:20.006
You got plenty of rooms.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.441
My boat is more comfortable
than anything in those rooms.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.442
(scoffs)

27:23.475 --> 27:24.677
MAN: Open it up.
(lock buzzes)

27:24.711 --> 27:25.945
Warden Decker.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.715
Thanks for taking the time
to meet us.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.282
Happy to help.
Don't mind the lighting.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.383
We're conserving energy.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.920
Well, it seems your systems
have stayed operational.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.287
The generators kicked in
three minutes

27:35.321 --> 27:36.222
after the lights went out.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.224
There were a few
chaotic moments in between,

27:38.257 --> 27:40.259
but nothing we couldn't handle.
I assume all inmates

27:40.292 --> 27:41.961
are accounted for?
Three times over.

27:41.994 --> 27:45.264
We have protocols we follow
in situations like this.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.033
It's a good thing you were
able to maintain order.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.001
Uh, I wouldn't
exactly say that.

27:49.035 --> 27:52.271
(man yells in distance)
The cable's still out.

27:52.304 --> 27:55.207
Hell hath no fury like an inmate
who misses his soap operas.

27:55.241 --> 27:57.910
Jose's in the last cell
on the left.

27:57.944 --> 27:59.712
Take all the time you need.

27:59.746 --> 28:03.282
(indistinct shouting
in distance)

28:03.315 --> 28:06.052
(guard speaking over P.A.)

28:08.855 --> 28:10.790
Jose Fuentes.

28:10.823 --> 28:12.358
Need to ask you
some questions.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.226
I'm not feeling well.
Come back later.

28:14.260 --> 28:17.029
I'd listen to him.
He hates being avoided.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.297
Come on, man, not today.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.932
SAM:
Look, last chance.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.000
Or else I'm gonna get more bold,

28:21.033 --> 28:22.334
and you're gonna get
less beautiful.

28:32.411 --> 28:34.446
Who the hell are you?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.749
Jose Fuentes.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.025
The warden said
there was three minutes

28:46.058 --> 28:47.426
between the outage
and the generator.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.095
That's enough time
to pull out the real Jose

28:49.128 --> 28:52.164
and stick in
this lookalike.
Right.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.001
So, Alicia wasn't planning on
taking over the family business.

28:55.034 --> 28:59.238
No, she was breaking out Jose
so he could get back into it.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.073
Shortcut.
(whoops)

29:01.107 --> 29:03.209
Like a ninja.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.012
Huh.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.847
Hey. Bearded dragons.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.449
That's cute. They got matching
beards, just like us.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.518
(snickers)

29:12.551 --> 29:15.387
And nothing else inside.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.989
Not even a poinsettia.

29:17.023 --> 29:19.258
Does nobody care
about Christmas anymore?

29:19.291 --> 29:21.828
I'd say that being a Grinch
falls under probable cause...

29:21.861 --> 29:23.195
(shouts)
Don't touch that.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.496
I'd really love
to grow old with you,

29:24.530 --> 29:26.198
and if we enter there
without a warrant,

29:26.232 --> 29:27.533
Mosley will not let that happen.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.535
Since when do you care
about a warrant?

29:29.568 --> 29:31.137
All right. Well,

29:31.170 --> 29:32.538
let's check out the garage.

29:33.305 --> 29:34.874
(tires screeching)

29:34.907 --> 29:36.242
* Run, run, Rudolph
Go!

29:36.275 --> 29:37.543
* Santa's got to
make it to town *

29:37.576 --> 29:40.112
(tires screeching)

29:40.146 --> 29:41.280
Okay.
Stop it. I'm driving.

29:41.313 --> 29:43.382
All right. Fine, I'm Ubering.
Deeks, I drive, you shoot.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.417
Okay, deal.
You drive, I shoot.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.353
Don't kill us. Please don't
kill us. Go, go, go, go.

29:47.386 --> 29:50.156
KENSI:
Yeah!

29:50.189 --> 29:51.858
* Like a merry-go-round

29:51.891 --> 29:54.793
(gunshots)

29:55.962 --> 29:58.497
(gunfire continues)

29:59.531 --> 30:01.300
* A little baby doll...

30:01.333 --> 30:02.568
(gunfire continues)

30:02.601 --> 30:05.171
(tires squealing)

30:05.204 --> 30:07.439
* Run, run, Rudolph

30:07.473 --> 30:10.342
* Reeling like
a merry-go-round. *

30:10.376 --> 30:13.079
(gasps)

30:13.112 --> 30:16.282
(panting)

30:16.315 --> 30:18.350
KENSI: Alicia Fuentes.
Oh.

30:19.351 --> 30:21.353
Nice shooting.

30:21.387 --> 30:23.089
Nice driving.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.073
Do I really need
to be here for this?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.608
No, you need to be here to
tell us where your brother is.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.176
Why would I help you?

30:44.210 --> 30:45.611
You people put him in jail.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.213
Our family was torn apart.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.148
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

30:49.181 --> 30:51.350
Unfortunately I do.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.252
Your brother made a choice.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.620
Now he has to pay the price.

30:54.653 --> 30:57.156
We've been paying the price
our whole lives.

30:57.189 --> 30:58.857
We were born into this world.

31:03.462 --> 31:06.298
Do you know my very first memory
was watching my father

31:06.332 --> 31:08.000
taken away on Christmas Day

31:08.034 --> 31:10.069
after a raid
on our family house?

31:10.102 --> 31:12.671
I was three, Jose was five.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.207
That is a lot
for a kid to process.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.976
Children shouldn't have to
grow up without their fathers.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.110
SAM:
You were on your way

31:18.144 --> 31:19.411
to break the cycle.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.646
What changed?

31:25.551 --> 31:27.386
Jose's my big brother.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.989
He's made mistakes, but he's
not who you think he is.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.194
He wasn't gonna
run the business.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.695
He just wouldn't turn on it,

31:36.728 --> 31:38.564
so he took the fall
for our family

31:38.597 --> 31:40.632
and now it's my turn
to make that sacrifice.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.135
Oh.

31:43.169 --> 31:46.272
We're gonna find Jose
with or without you.

31:46.305 --> 31:49.641
But if you help us,
maybe you'll get a chance

31:49.675 --> 31:51.177
to get on the right path
one day.

31:51.210 --> 31:53.045
CALLEN:
This is your opportunity

31:53.079 --> 31:54.346
to break that cycle...

31:54.380 --> 31:56.215
for good.

32:01.520 --> 32:04.256
Alicia just gave us the address
to a house in Hancock Park.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.958
They're having
a welcome home party.

32:05.992 --> 32:06.993
That's where Jose's headed.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.128
She's gonna make a call for us,
buy us some time.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.729
What did we learn
about the man in Jose's cell?

32:10.762 --> 32:13.365
Well, he works maintenance at
the prison, and looks like Jose

32:13.399 --> 32:15.401
has dirt on him that he didn't
want getting back to the warden.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.736
Well, he must've paid off
some of the guards as well.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.072
They delay the generator,
he's able to escape undetected.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.040
NELL:
Hey, guys.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.475
So, it looks like the house
in Hancock Park

32:23.509 --> 32:26.645
is owned by LPR Industries,
which is...

32:26.678 --> 32:29.515
A shell company, 'cause
it's always a shell company.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.983
HIDOKO:
That's correct.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.585
But its current tenant
is Luisa Ruiz,

32:33.619 --> 32:36.355
the longtime girlfriend
of Jose and mother of Roberto.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.556
NELL:
Roberto was born

32:37.589 --> 32:39.425
five months
after Jose was arrested.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.360
That would make
him about five now.

32:41.393 --> 32:44.096
That's the same age Jose was
when his father went to prison.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.264
He's not gonna
stick around long.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.498
We need to head out. Nell...

32:46.532 --> 32:47.499
Oh, I'm one step ahead of you.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.636
I suggest you read up
on your reds and whites.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.271
And I'm not talking candy canes.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.740
(laughs)

32:54.773 --> 32:56.242
Speaking of candy canes...

32:58.110 --> 33:00.546
* Oh, the weather outside
is frightful *

33:00.579 --> 33:05.017
* But the fire
is so delightful *

33:05.051 --> 33:08.054
* And since we've no place
to go *

33:08.087 --> 33:11.290
* Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow... *

33:11.323 --> 33:13.759
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

33:13.792 --> 33:15.694
What do you kids
want for Christmas?

33:15.727 --> 33:17.729
You're the worst Santa ever.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.498
DEEKS:
Ugh! Aah.

33:19.531 --> 33:21.500
What did you do? Show them a
picture of you in your helmet?

33:21.533 --> 33:23.402
Uh, I told him later on, he's
gonna meet a beautiful woman.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.403
He's gonna fall in love with her

33:24.436 --> 33:26.138
and then she's gonna steal
all his presents.

33:26.172 --> 33:27.073
(chuckles)

33:27.106 --> 33:28.440
I hear marriage counseling
works wonders.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.676
DEEKS: Why does everybody
keep saying that to me?
There you go.

33:30.709 --> 33:31.710
Pay me $350 an hour,
I'll tell you.

33:31.743 --> 33:32.511
(Deeks laughs)

33:32.544 --> 33:34.646
That's never gonna happen.
(snorts)

33:42.754 --> 33:44.556
I got eyes on Jose.
He's heading back.

33:44.590 --> 33:46.358
Got him. I'm moving in.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.826
We do this as quiet
as he lets us.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.195
It's over, Jose.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.397
You don't want your
son to see this.

33:51.430 --> 33:52.698
You walk out of
here with me now,

33:52.731 --> 33:54.300
he'll never know.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.068
(grunting)

33:56.102 --> 33:57.436
He's on the run,
moving towards the front door.

33:57.469 --> 34:00.306
Hi. Would you like one?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.208
They're so good. They'll
knock you off your feet.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.751
ROBERTO:
Papa.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.423
What's happening?

34:20.526 --> 34:21.760
Where are you going?

34:21.793 --> 34:25.864
Ho, ho, ho, ho!
Well, listen,

34:25.897 --> 34:27.666
we need your dad back
at the North Pole, okay?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.435
There's still a lot of
toys that need to get made.

34:29.468 --> 34:31.570
So is it okay if he
comes back with us?

34:32.771 --> 34:34.773
Yeah, I guess so.

34:34.806 --> 34:35.874
That's okay?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.176
Mm.
That's great.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.477
Okay. Let's go
grab some eggnog.

34:38.510 --> 34:40.512
All right.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.648
CALLEN: We know this was about
more than your freedom.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.885
All I wanted was to be
back with my family,

34:46.918 --> 34:48.387
to be a father.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.623
I was gonna do it
right this time.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.792
Breaking out of prison
feels like a bad start.

34:53.825 --> 34:57.296
Being away from my
son was a torture.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.431
You know this is gonna
add time to your sentence.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.337
It felt like my only option.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.543
I just want to spend
time with him.

35:14.446 --> 35:16.915
It's gonna take us a while
to sort this out.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.384
At least 30 minutes.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.852
Stay close.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.755
Thank you.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.194
Roberto.
(speaks Spanish)

35:29.328 --> 35:31.330
(speaking Spanish)

35:34.400 --> 35:36.302
(continues speaking Spanish
softly)

35:49.748 --> 35:51.783
CALLEN:
You got to be kidding me.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.419
It should've been
restored hours ago.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.821
("Winter Wonderland" playing)
(chuckles)

35:55.854 --> 35:57.923
KENSI: This has Eric
written all over it.

35:57.956 --> 35:59.358
Sorry to disappoint.

35:59.391 --> 36:00.792
Ma'am, I thought
there were rules.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.229
MOSLEY: With all due
respect, there are rules,

36:03.262 --> 36:04.696
but I also have the power
to override them.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.265
Merry Christmas.

36:06.298 --> 36:07.533
DEEKS: (whistles)
This is impressive.

36:07.566 --> 36:08.800
Where did you find all this?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.836
It took a little investigating,

36:10.869 --> 36:12.771
and I had a little help.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.373
Oh, hello there.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.741
(laughter)

36:15.774 --> 36:17.776
Looks like this crowd
could use a little drink.

36:17.809 --> 36:18.910
DEEKS: It's an elf
with cocktails.
Come on.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.279
(laughter)

36:20.312 --> 36:22.914
Your friendly Christmas elf.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.283
Eggnog, huh?
Yeah.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.484
I'm gonna give
you the full one.

36:25.517 --> 36:26.652
(laughing):
Okay.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.420
This is gonna work out
well for me.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.588
NELL:
Come on,

36:29.621 --> 36:30.556
eggnog.
DEEKS: Wow.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.524
Thank you.
Okay, here.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.560
I can definitely
use a drink.
Enjoy.

36:34.593 --> 36:35.827
Here we go.

36:35.861 --> 36:36.895
Eggnog.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.398
Thank you.
Enjoy, ladies.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.500
Cheers, boss.
Cheers.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.502
Come here.
(clears throat)

36:43.535 --> 36:45.437
So, I was thinking...
Hmm?

36:45.471 --> 36:47.439
...this year, we should
stack our presents high.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.974
Our wedding
is just one day.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.442
We can go without centerpieces.

36:50.476 --> 36:51.710
It's fine.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.945
It's a holiday tradition
I'd rather invest in.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.448
Well, I've been doing some
thinking, too, some research.

36:56.482 --> 36:58.350
Read some Redbook.

36:58.384 --> 36:59.918
And it turns out

36:59.951 --> 37:01.720
the most successful marriages
are based on compromise.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.856
So, I think we should do
it your way this year.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.660
You sure?
I'm positive.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.697
But that means next year,
we're going all-out, my way.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.999
So maybe you want to grab
a pencil, take this down.

37:14.032 --> 37:15.734
I was thinking maybe,
like, a grill set.

37:15.767 --> 37:17.503
And, as you know, I don't
actually have a grill,

37:17.536 --> 37:19.338
so you could get that in
addition to the grill set.

37:19.371 --> 37:21.740
We should grab a pen.
(laughs)

37:21.773 --> 37:24.476
Come here. Cheers.
Cheers.

37:24.510 --> 37:25.411
I don't want it, eggnog.

37:25.444 --> 37:26.945
KENSI: Drink it. (laughs)
I don't want it.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.580
All right.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.782
It's a Christmas miracle.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.352
Good one.
Ah, you made it.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.520
Hey.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.788
If it were up to me,
all of Westside Electric

37:36.822 --> 37:37.989
would be getting
coal this year.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.626
Well, if it makes you feel
any better, I took your advice.

37:40.659 --> 37:41.693
Got a hotel.

37:41.727 --> 37:43.562
Yeah? That does
make me feel better.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.665
Yeah, I stand by the fact that
my boat would have been fine,

37:46.698 --> 37:47.533
but being in that room
with you today

37:47.566 --> 37:50.402
made me realize
the importance of space.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.305
That, not so much.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.041
But I'll take it.
All right.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.377
Happy holidays, Sam.
Thank you.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.045
Enjoy your staycation.

38:01.079 --> 38:03.715
So you take advice
from Eric now?

38:03.749 --> 38:04.550
Here we go.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.984
That's okay.
It's more brisket for me.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.719
(chuckles)

38:07.753 --> 38:09.455
You know,

38:09.488 --> 38:12.591
this first year without
Michelle has been hell so far.

38:12.624 --> 38:16.628
I don't know what
I'm doing, but...

38:16.662 --> 38:17.796
I do know that the kids and I,

38:17.829 --> 38:19.831
we need room to figure
it out on our own.

38:21.733 --> 38:25.103
If you need to talk,
you know where I am.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.406
Sometimes, to figure things out,
all you need to do is listen.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.675
(others laughing)

38:31.510 --> 38:33.479
Another round?

38:33.512 --> 38:35.481
Thanks. I, uh...

38:35.514 --> 38:37.549
I need to make a stop
on the way home.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.918
Mm. Cool.
KENSI: Merry
Christmas, everybody.

38:39.951 --> 38:41.887
NELL: All right,
everybody ready?

38:41.920 --> 38:44.923
ERIC: And cheers.
(cheering, laughter)

38:47.593 --> 38:49.695
(whooping)
Join us!

38:49.728 --> 38:51.830
(cheering)
Cheers.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.433
(indistinct chatter)
(sighs)

38:58.470 --> 39:00.406
(sighs)

39:01.440 --> 39:03.742
(knocking on door)

39:05.477 --> 39:07.012
Anything else tonight?

39:08.747 --> 39:11.617
No. I was just actually...

39:11.650 --> 39:13.419
finishing up.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.986
Have a good night.

39:19.858 --> 39:23.028
I know bending the rules
isn't your strong suit, but...

39:23.061 --> 39:24.663
what you did tonight
was important.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.965
For the team. And for us.

39:29.134 --> 39:30.569
Merry Christmas.

39:30.602 --> 39:32.771
Thanks, Hidoko.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.907
Have a good night.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.476
(sniffles)
(door opens)

39:37.509 --> 39:38.510
(door closes)

39:42.714 --> 39:44.850
(sighs)

40:07.706 --> 40:08.940
Thought you and Brady

40:08.974 --> 40:10.909
might be halfway
to Burning Man by now.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.612
No, we had a little falling out
over his opinion of Funyuns.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.146
Well, look, I'm kind of in
a hurry. You want to just skip

40:15.180 --> 40:16.515
to the bullet points
of this lecture?

40:16.548 --> 40:17.749
I'm not here to lecture you.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.752
Why were you checking up on me?

40:20.786 --> 40:23.054
I came over to invite you
to Christmas dinner.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.890
It never
occurred to me

40:24.923 --> 40:26.057
that you were running a Hilton.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.659
I needed the money.

40:27.693 --> 40:30.896
Hmm. You got tired
of stealing, huh?

40:31.930 --> 40:34.466
Hey, I paid for all of these.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.935
Okay? They're not for me.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.036
They're for the others.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.576
They're for the other
kids at the shelter.

40:46.978 --> 40:48.980
It's not fair.

40:50.015 --> 40:52.150
No.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.020
It's not.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.058
They didn't choose
to get passed over,

41:00.091 --> 41:02.994
and yet they get reminded of it
every year.

41:03.028 --> 41:06.498
I wanted to give them one year
where they weren't.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.733
You're one of those kids.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.736
So are you.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.171
(chuckles softly)

41:13.204 --> 41:15.907
Well...
(sighs)

41:15.941 --> 41:19.477
you need an extra hand
passing these out?

41:20.278 --> 41:21.980
As long as
your other one

41:22.013 --> 41:23.615
doesn't punch any more
holes in the wall.

41:26.618 --> 41:28.954
So what'd you get
for that place?

41:28.987 --> 41:31.156
$200 a night.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.593
$200?
(chuckles): Yeah.

41:34.626 --> 41:36.595
Yeah, I don't know what
that guy was smoking.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.864
$200.
I got skills.

41:38.897 --> 41:41.199
Apparently so.
