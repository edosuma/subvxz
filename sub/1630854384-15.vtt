09:54.803 --> 09:56.906
Yeah, you do.
I'm sorry.

09:58.240 --> 09:59.708
It's gonna be okay.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.811
-All right?
-You really think so?

10:03.979 --> 10:05.014
I do.

10:06.615 --> 10:08.651
Why'd he hook up with him?

10:10.186 --> 10:11.587
It's gonna be all right.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.558
I don't know.

10:16.492 --> 10:17.660
I hope so.

10:17.660 --> 10:20.162
It will, I promise you.
It will.

10:22.064 --> 10:23.566
Let's just go to bed.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.068
You need a good night's rest.

10:26.068 --> 10:28.637
I do, I couldn't even
sleep in there.

10:29.605 --> 10:30.873
I can imagine.

10:32.775 --> 10:34.710
I don't ever wanna go back.

10:37.913 --> 10:39.148
You won't.

10:39.148 --> 10:46.956
[music]

10:48.924 --> 10:51.160
It's gonna be all right.
All right?

10:51.160 --> 10:52.161
It's gonna be all right.

10:54.547 --> 10:58.017
[phone ringing]

10:58.551 --> 10:59.952
Hello?

10:59.952 --> 11:00.953
Bad time?

11:00.953 --> 11:01.988
[Andi]<i> No...</i>

11:01.988 --> 11:03.756
Looks like I'm gonna need
that number.

11:03.756 --> 11:05.224
Are you gonna call him?

11:06.659 --> 11:08.127
I don't really have a choice.

11:09.862 --> 11:10.830
Okay.

11:11.864 --> 11:13.766
I'll get the number for you
in the morning.

11:14.333 --> 11:15.601
Okay.

11:17.336 --> 11:20.173
Robin, I'm sorry.
About all this.

11:21.073 --> 11:22.108
Why are you sorry?

11:25.077 --> 11:25.945
Well...

11:25.945 --> 11:28.080
Hey, you gave me a head's up.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.282
I got it.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.885
-I know you do.
-[Robin]<i> Well...</i>

11:32.885 --> 11:34.220
until he comes and
breaks my arms

11:34.220 --> 11:35.288
'cause I don't pay him.

11:37.423 --> 11:38.891
You're gonna pay him.

11:38.891 --> 11:41.527
I'm gonna look at his fine print
and his terms, but, uh...

11:42.495 --> 11:43.896
I'm up against a wall.

11:45.164 --> 11:46.199
I'm really sorry.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.768
That Gary's a cunning one, huh?

11:50.236 --> 11:51.170
I know.

11:52.238 --> 11:53.272
You like that?

11:54.106 --> 11:56.776
I've never dealt with him
in business, so...

11:57.677 --> 11:59.178
Well, he's shrewd.

12:00.213 --> 12:01.180
I heard.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.748
And to make this move...

12:03.015 --> 12:04.250
[Andi]<i> Again.</i>

12:04.984 --> 12:06.919
But hey, you gave me
the head's up.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.688
I didn't.

12:08.688 --> 12:10.990
Well, you gave me
the information to help myself.

12:12.625 --> 12:13.759
I owe you one.

12:14.427 --> 12:15.795
You don't owe me anything.

12:15.795 --> 12:18.097
I was an asshole,
and I shouldn't have been.

12:18.631 --> 12:19.732
It's fine.

12:20.266 --> 12:22.301
Well, thank you for not
holding it against me.

12:22.301 --> 12:26.072
And thank you for helping me
with my friend.

12:26.872 --> 12:28.007
Sure.

12:28.274 --> 12:29.508
[Andi]<i> Um...</i>

12:29.508 --> 12:31.410
<i>I have another favor to ask.</i>

12:31.811 --> 12:33.145
I'm on my way.

12:33.646 --> 12:35.948
I did not mean it like that.

12:36.849 --> 12:39.218
Right, 'cause Gary's
probably on his way.

12:42.255 --> 12:43.623
Maurice Webb.

12:45.324 --> 12:46.626
Her accomplice?

12:47.360 --> 12:48.928
Don't do that.
He's innocent.

12:49.495 --> 12:51.897
Andi, are you sure you can
vouch for these people?

12:52.498 --> 12:53.432
Yeah.

12:53.799 --> 12:55.134
Absolutely.

12:56.569 --> 12:57.837
Okay, what do you need?

12:58.871 --> 13:02.475
Well, I was wondering
if you can...

13:02.475 --> 13:04.176
help me get bail for him?

13:05.144 --> 13:07.346
Andi, I do not have another
million dollars.

13:07.346 --> 13:08.881
You know my situation.

13:08.881 --> 13:10.216
[Andi]<i> I know that.</i>

13:10.216 --> 13:12.285
But could you at least...

13:12.285 --> 13:13.986
help me get in to see him?

13:15.521 --> 13:17.156
I'll give you a call
in the morning.

13:17.156 --> 13:18.157
[Andi]<i> Okay.</i>

13:18.858 --> 13:21.394
It's really cool to have
a powerful boss.

13:22.428 --> 13:23.362
Yeah?

13:24.597 --> 13:25.765
Thank you.

13:25.765 --> 13:27.667
Let's just hope
I stay your boss.

13:28.701 --> 13:31.070
You're gonna get through this.
Okay?

13:31.437 --> 13:32.772
Yeah, I hope so.

13:34.073 --> 13:35.474
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.210
I'll see you then.
Bye.

13:38.644 --> 13:39.679
Bye.

13:46.819 --> 13:49.088
-Hi!
-[Gary] Hey.

13:49.088 --> 13:50.423
[door closing]

13:52.491 --> 13:54.093
Sorry, I thought
you were sleeping.

13:55.394 --> 13:57.997
No...
I was just on the phone.

13:58.664 --> 14:00.733
Yeah, I...

14:00.733 --> 14:02.068
I heard you.

14:05.471 --> 14:06.439
Who was that?

14:08.641 --> 14:10.343
We're not doin' that.

14:12.478 --> 14:13.713
I'm sorry.

14:13.713 --> 14:15.114
Okay.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.951
Were you...

14:18.951 --> 14:21.020
listening to my conversation?

14:22.421 --> 14:23.956
Yeah, I was.

14:26.392 --> 14:27.326
Why?

14:27.960 --> 14:30.429
Well, I came in and heard
voices at the door,

14:30.429 --> 14:33.265
so I thought you were in here
with someone.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.068
See, that's why you can't
have access...

14:36.068 --> 14:37.503
-I...
-[Andi] Mm-hm.

14:37.503 --> 14:39.905
I just thought someone was
in here or something,

14:39.905 --> 14:41.173
I don't know.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.775
And if there was someone
in here, I mean...

14:44.443 --> 14:46.345
It's my...

14:46.345 --> 14:47.580
-It's your place.
-Yeah.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.514
-I know.
-Okay.

14:48.514 --> 14:49.548
It's your place.

14:49.548 --> 14:50.850
Okay.

14:52.051 --> 14:53.886
Gosh, look.
I don't wanna fight.

14:53.886 --> 14:55.287
I was just around the way,

14:55.287 --> 14:58.758
playin' basketball with
the guys, I said.

14:58.758 --> 15:01.193
So, can I just shower
and then go to bed?

15:02.995 --> 15:04.630
As long as you don't
wanna fight.

15:04.630 --> 15:05.798
I do not.

15:05.798 --> 15:09.402
[music]

15:09.402 --> 15:10.302
Okay.

15:10.836 --> 15:12.304
You may take a shower.

15:13.239 --> 15:14.273
[Gary] Thank you.

15:15.608 --> 15:19.345
Also, I have some other things
I need you to do, so...

15:19.345 --> 15:21.514
make it fast.

15:21.514 --> 15:22.915
-Oh...
-Yeah.

15:22.915 --> 15:24.517
I have some plans for you, so...

15:24.517 --> 15:27.486
Yeah, yeah.
Use that speed.

15:32.725 --> 15:33.926
[door closing]

15:37.797 --> 15:40.366
[phone ringing]

15:41.400 --> 15:43.502
-Hey.
-[Gary]<i> Hey.</i>

15:43.969 --> 15:45.704
-[Gary]<i> Hayden!
</i>-What's up, bro?

15:45.704 --> 15:46.906
Man...

15:46.906 --> 15:48.707
You are not gonna believe

15:48.707 --> 15:50.342
<i>where I am at.</i>

15:50.342 --> 15:53.546
So we got some dinner, right?
We came back to the hotel room.

15:54.346 --> 15:56.515
Hey, no, no, no, hold on.
Listen, listen.

15:56.515 --> 15:58.984
What?
Hey, look, listen.

15:58.984 --> 16:00.352
She's in the bathroom right now.

16:00.352 --> 16:02.321
I'm tellin' you,
soon as she come out,

16:02.321 --> 16:04.190
I'm about to tear
that ass up, boy!

16:05.057 --> 16:06.492
Huh?
What, what's up?

16:06.492 --> 16:08.194
I think Andi told Robin
about the call.

16:09.228 --> 16:10.496
Okay?

16:11.063 --> 16:12.598
He already knows, right?

16:12.598 --> 16:13.933
I know, but...

16:13.933 --> 16:16.101
But I think he may have
a way out.

16:17.403 --> 16:18.370
An out?

16:19.038 --> 16:21.273
No, no, no, look.
He is so leveraged.

16:21.273 --> 16:23.209
<i>There ain't no way,
I'm tellin' you.</i>

16:23.209 --> 16:24.410
I know that.

16:25.811 --> 16:27.313
I think she's up to something.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.381
Okay.

16:29.381 --> 16:30.950
Well, looks like you gon' have
to handle that, because...

16:30.950 --> 16:32.718
I'm about to have my hands full.

16:32.718 --> 16:34.820
So, I don't know.
Talk in the morning?

16:34.820 --> 16:36.689
Oh my...
You're killin' me.

16:36.689 --> 16:38.157
Yeah.
In the mornin'.

16:38.157 --> 16:42.761
[music]

16:42.761 --> 16:44.363
[Hayden] Hey.

16:44.363 --> 16:45.397
You ready?

16:45.397 --> 16:46.532
Oh, absolutely.

16:46.532 --> 16:50.336
[music]

16:52.405 --> 16:58.211
[music]

16:58.211 --> 16:59.078
Mm.

16:59.078 --> 17:00.680
I'm sorry,
is this too soon?

17:00.680 --> 17:02.081
No, not at all.

17:03.916 --> 17:05.018
It's just...

17:05.018 --> 17:06.819
when I first saw you...

17:06.819 --> 17:08.488
I was blown away.

17:08.488 --> 17:09.655
Oh, yeah?

17:09.655 --> 17:10.623
[Tamara] Yeah.

17:11.657 --> 17:13.092
You're so sexy.

17:13.092 --> 17:14.827
Oh, come on, now.

17:14.827 --> 17:15.828
You are.

17:15.828 --> 17:17.797
Nah...

17:17.797 --> 17:19.032
Your smile...

17:20.333 --> 17:21.501
Your body.

17:21.501 --> 17:22.769
Oh, yeah?

17:22.769 --> 17:27.306
[music]

17:27.306 --> 17:28.074
I knew it.

17:28.074 --> 17:29.509
[Hayden] What?

17:29.509 --> 17:31.878
I knew I was gonna love what
you had under there.

17:32.278 --> 17:33.946
Well, I'm glad you like it.

17:33.946 --> 17:46.092
[music]

17:51.831 --> 17:53.966
I just want you.

17:53.966 --> 18:03.543
[music]

18:06.479 --> 18:07.780
Mm.

18:08.114 --> 18:10.116
Well, don't you look nice?

18:10.116 --> 18:11.517
Oh, thank you.

18:13.186 --> 18:14.420
[Fatima] Where you goin'?

18:15.555 --> 18:16.656
Goin' to see the attorney.

18:17.290 --> 18:18.324
Again?

18:18.324 --> 18:20.593
Yeah, gotta take
the paperwork to her.

18:21.060 --> 18:22.228
Okay.

18:24.097 --> 18:25.698
Did you talk to Heather?

18:26.299 --> 18:28.568
No, she not answerin'
my phone calls.

18:28.568 --> 18:30.069
She playin' games, so...

18:30.069 --> 18:32.171
Wouldn't that be
a waste of time?

18:32.171 --> 18:33.639
No, not at all.

18:34.373 --> 18:36.209
But ain't she with Hayden?
So...

18:36.209 --> 18:39.178
Yeah.
I got somebody on that.

18:40.346 --> 18:41.180
Mm-hm.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.548
What are you gonna do?

18:42.548 --> 18:45.351
Nothin'.
Nothin' crazy.

18:45.718 --> 18:46.919
You ain't gon' kill him?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.454
No, Zac.

18:48.855 --> 18:50.990
But she is gonna get his heart.

18:51.424 --> 18:53.559
Oh, so you findin'
this -- love?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.428
That's whack.

18:55.428 --> 18:58.097
Listen, you just focus on
talkin' to the lawyer,

18:58.097 --> 18:59.298
tellin' her what Karen said,

18:59.298 --> 19:00.867
and get her to sign
those papers.

19:00.867 --> 19:02.535
I got you.
But that's easy.

19:02.535 --> 19:03.669
I emailed her yesterday.

19:03.669 --> 19:04.937
She sent the one back,

19:04.937 --> 19:06.539
saying Karen'll have
the paperwork by this afternoon.

19:06.539 --> 19:08.341
Oh.
Good.

19:08.341 --> 19:10.143
-I'm on a roll, baby.
-[Fatima] I see!

19:10.143 --> 19:11.677
What, you want me to
wait for you?

19:12.044 --> 19:13.179
For what?

19:13.179 --> 19:15.681
To go give the paperwork
to Karen.

19:15.681 --> 19:17.049
Oh, no.

19:19.785 --> 19:20.987
Are you serious?

19:21.821 --> 19:23.089
[Fatima] Yeah, I'm serious.

19:23.723 --> 19:25.291
You want me to go by myself?

19:25.825 --> 19:27.226
Yes, Zac.
What's...?

19:27.693 --> 19:29.996
You was the main one sayin'
she had to come here!

19:29.996 --> 19:31.731
Now you just gon' send me
over there, like...?

19:31.731 --> 19:32.865
I know, I know, but look.

19:32.865 --> 19:34.133
If you gon' do somethin',

19:34.133 --> 19:35.535
you gon' do it later,
when I'm not there.

19:35.535 --> 19:37.870
So, you might as well go on
and do it now, I trust you.

19:37.870 --> 19:40.173
I'm just sayin'!
Fine, shoot.

19:40.173 --> 19:42.308
I know there's two...

19:42.308 --> 19:44.710
Oh, did you notice?

19:44.710 --> 19:46.779
Somebody is wearin'
their engagement ring.

19:48.648 --> 19:49.749
Indeed.

19:49.749 --> 19:50.950
Sky's gettin' cold in here.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.351
-Frosty.
-Icy.

19:52.351 --> 19:54.554
I can't see, you blindin' me.

19:55.188 --> 19:57.089
Look good on you.
Let me check it out.

19:57.089 --> 19:58.558
You did good.

19:58.558 --> 20:00.359
So that means now we can
start talkin' about the wedding?

20:00.359 --> 20:02.128
As soon as you handle
your business.

20:02.128 --> 20:03.529
-I will.
-[Fatima] Okay.

20:03.529 --> 20:04.730
[Zac] See, I got
a briefcase, right?

20:04.730 --> 20:06.699
I see, you lookin'
real official right now.

20:06.699 --> 20:07.767
Official...

20:07.767 --> 20:08.734
Like a whistle.

20:09.402 --> 20:10.803
-You know what I'm sayin'?
-[Fatima] I see.

20:10.803 --> 20:13.306
I'm gon' file
on all these --.

20:13.306 --> 20:14.340
-You better.
-[Zac] Let's go.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.575
-You ready to rock?
-Yep.

20:15.575 --> 20:17.476
-[Zac] I love you.
-I love you, too.

20:17.476 --> 20:19.178
Gimme some.

20:19.178 --> 20:20.980
-All right.
-My wife-to-be.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.515
-That's right.
-[Zac] Go 'head.

20:22.515 --> 20:23.449
All right.

20:23.683 --> 20:24.984
I'll see you later.

20:24.984 --> 20:26.352
All right!

20:26.652 --> 20:27.920
I'm right behind you.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.655
Always behind you.

20:29.655 --> 20:39.131
[music]

20:42.668 --> 20:45.338
Are you really tryin' to
sneak outta here?

20:45.705 --> 20:47.106
Hello to you, too.

20:47.974 --> 20:49.242
I'm goin' to work.

20:49.242 --> 20:51.210
Yo, you know you don't have
to sneak to work.

20:51.210 --> 20:53.813
I'm not.
I'm just ready.

20:54.614 --> 20:56.549
Okay.
Bye.

20:57.316 --> 20:58.651
What are you doin' today?

20:59.552 --> 21:01.087
I'm probably gonna head home.

21:03.823 --> 21:04.857
Okay.

21:05.691 --> 21:08.594
Yeah, so I should be at
the airport sometime later.

21:09.495 --> 21:10.429
All right.

21:12.031 --> 21:13.666
That's all you have to say?

21:15.167 --> 21:16.202
Yeah.

21:16.202 --> 21:17.536
It's...

21:18.537 --> 21:20.439
We ain't talkin' about
that ring right now.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.476
So what, I should just
give her the ring?

21:23.476 --> 21:25.211
You know, Preston, this...

21:25.211 --> 21:26.679
This ain't gonna work.

21:27.980 --> 21:29.382
What's not gonna work?

21:29.382 --> 21:31.684
Threatening to marry her
if I don't do what you want.

21:31.684 --> 21:32.885
I'm not threatening you.

21:32.885 --> 21:36.055
Okay, well, I guess maybe
it's an ultimatum, then.

21:36.055 --> 21:37.590
'Cause I don't know what
you call this.

21:37.590 --> 21:39.425
Danni, look...

21:41.027 --> 21:43.329
You don't want me, and she does.

21:43.329 --> 21:45.498
So, what, I should
just be with her?

21:47.433 --> 21:50.269
If that logic tracks for you,
then okay.

21:51.570 --> 21:53.773
See, the problem with that is
I know that

21:53.773 --> 21:55.241
I'll always love you.

21:56.709 --> 21:58.711
How many guy friends
do you have?

21:59.278 --> 22:00.513
A few, why?

22:02.214 --> 22:03.883
What do they say about
all this?

22:03.883 --> 22:05.851
Oh...
Yeah...

22:06.952 --> 22:08.621
You, you, you don't wanna know.

22:09.355 --> 22:11.057
Sweetie, I don't care.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.793
I just wanna know what advice
you get.

22:16.195 --> 22:17.163
Yeah.

22:17.163 --> 22:18.631
That Mindy...

22:18.898 --> 22:20.132
Mindy what?

22:20.132 --> 22:21.400
Yeah.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.035
-Mindy's a good girl.
-[Danni] Mm-hm.

22:23.035 --> 22:24.870
And that I should
just be with her,

22:24.870 --> 22:25.938
and stop runnin' after you.

22:26.305 --> 22:28.607
'Kay.
Then be with Mindy.

22:28.607 --> 22:31.110
[Preston] See, that's
their opinion.

22:31.644 --> 22:34.146
She don't do for me what you do.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.514
Well, Preston, I don't...

22:35.514 --> 22:38.417
know what else to tell you,
how else to tell you.

22:38.417 --> 22:39.952
You don't have to tell me
anything.

22:39.952 --> 22:41.320
I get it.

22:42.288 --> 22:43.789
I really hope you do.

22:46.592 --> 22:47.560
I do.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.465
Well, I gotta head to work.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.368
See you later.

22:55.735 --> 22:56.669
See you there.

22:58.604 --> 23:02.341
[footsteps]

23:05.111 --> 23:06.245
[knocking on door]

23:06.245 --> 23:07.680
Yes?

23:08.314 --> 23:10.282
-[Andi]<i> It's Andi.
</i>-[Robin] Come in.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.252
-Hi.
-[Andi] Hi.

23:14.887 --> 23:16.589
I have that number for you.

23:17.656 --> 23:20.493
-Thank you.
-There you are.

23:21.694 --> 23:22.862
Thank you.

23:22.862 --> 23:24.296
So you gonna do it?

23:24.296 --> 23:26.732
Yep.
I'll give him a call.

23:27.666 --> 23:28.667
[Andi] Okay.

23:30.403 --> 23:31.704
So, how long do you have?

23:33.105 --> 23:34.573
Not long, but it's all right.

23:35.107 --> 23:36.275
All right.

23:37.176 --> 23:38.744
You look amazing, by the way.

23:39.812 --> 23:41.947
Was that appropriate for
the workplace?

23:42.815 --> 23:43.883
Are we appropriate?

23:45.184 --> 23:46.285
I think so.

23:46.285 --> 23:47.953
All about business.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.321
See you later.

23:49.321 --> 23:50.656
Thank you, again.

23:58.782 --> 24:00.116
[knocking on door]

24:00.116 --> 24:01.451
Come in.

24:03.153 --> 24:04.487
-Hey.
-[Andi] Hey.

24:05.889 --> 24:07.057
I have your coffee.

24:07.057 --> 24:09.159
Oh, thank you, sis.

24:09.159 --> 24:11.628
All the cases are organized,
so we're good on that.

24:11.628 --> 24:13.663
-Okay.
-All right, cool.

24:13.663 --> 24:14.698
So, um...

24:16.733 --> 24:18.468
You always think you can get
outta here.

24:18.468 --> 24:19.703
I knew this was comin'.

24:19.703 --> 24:21.871
[Andi] Mm-hm.
Have a seat.

24:21.871 --> 24:22.906
Thank you.

24:24.340 --> 24:26.309
So, what did you think
about last night?

24:27.911 --> 24:30.447
I, I think Zac needs to
figure that out.

24:30.447 --> 24:31.948
[Andi] For what it's worth,

24:31.948 --> 24:34.818
I think you handled yourself
really well.

24:36.052 --> 24:37.353
Look, I'm always gonna be me.

24:37.353 --> 24:39.389
-So...
-[Andi] Very true.

24:39.389 --> 24:42.525
And how do you feel about
the baby being Zac's?

24:43.760 --> 24:47.363
I mean, I'm cool with it.
It was before me, so...

24:47.363 --> 24:49.232
How are you so cool
about everything?

24:49.232 --> 24:51.301
I mean, what would you
be doin', Andi?

24:51.301 --> 24:53.236
Honey, I do not know.

24:53.236 --> 24:54.671
-But...
-[Fatima] Yeah.

24:54.671 --> 24:56.406
You'd be doin' the same thing.

24:56.406 --> 24:58.608
'Cause Gary's situation
was crazy.

25:00.009 --> 25:01.211
Good point.

25:01.211 --> 25:03.546
-It was.
-[Andi] Okay, all right.

25:03.546 --> 25:04.781
That's enough.

25:06.349 --> 25:08.017
I see you have the ring on.

25:08.017 --> 25:10.420
Yeah. Yeah.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.422
-[Andi] It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

25:12.422 --> 25:13.590
Let me see it.

25:15.158 --> 25:16.493
So pretty!

25:18.161 --> 25:19.295
But, um...

25:19.295 --> 25:20.797
How did Karen handle that?

25:21.965 --> 25:23.066
Fatima...

25:24.167 --> 25:25.368
You know what?
It's cool.

25:25.368 --> 25:26.870
But don't ask me about my ring.

25:27.737 --> 25:28.905
Touché.

25:28.905 --> 25:30.039
Yeah.

25:30.039 --> 25:31.708
[Andi] She's fine.

25:31.708 --> 25:35.111
Everything is fine, I think she
is in a great space with Aaron.

25:35.612 --> 25:37.080
-Okay, that's good.
-[Andi] Mm-hm.

25:37.080 --> 25:38.448
Yeah.

25:38.448 --> 25:40.316
So, they both can leave us
the hell alone.

25:40.316 --> 25:41.384
I like that.

25:41.384 --> 25:42.986
-Good space.
-Okay, yes.

25:42.986 --> 25:44.654
The goal is for everyone
to be happy.

25:44.654 --> 25:46.856
So, I'm happy that
that's happening.

25:46.856 --> 25:48.057
True, true.

25:48.057 --> 25:49.826
[phone buzzing]

25:50.360 --> 25:52.095
Your phone's ringing?

25:52.095 --> 25:53.429
Oh, can I take this?

25:53.429 --> 25:54.664
Yeah.

25:56.599 --> 25:58.234
-Hey.
-[Tamara]<i> Hey.</i>

25:58.234 --> 25:59.769
How was your night?

25:59.769 --> 26:00.603
Good.

26:00.603 --> 26:02.138
I got him, girl.

26:02.138 --> 26:03.306
[Fatima]<i> Oh, you did?</i>

26:03.306 --> 26:04.874
Yes, he was eatin'
out of my hand.

26:04.874 --> 26:06.943
He didn't even wanna leave
this morning.

26:06.943 --> 26:08.044
Is that so?

26:08.044 --> 26:10.814
[Tamara]<i> Uh-huh!
But just so you know...</i>

26:10.814 --> 26:13.249
I'mma get his ass
for all he got.

26:13.249 --> 26:15.385
Mm, I like that.
So...

26:15.852 --> 26:18.188
When are you gonna
see Hayden again?

26:18.188 --> 26:19.189
Tonight.

26:19.589 --> 26:21.925
I'm telling you,
he didn't wanna leave.

26:23.259 --> 26:25.395
This is great.
Good.

26:25.395 --> 26:26.696
[Tamara]<i> I got you.</i>

26:26.696 --> 26:28.898
Okay, so did he say anything
worth mentioning?

26:28.898 --> 26:31.034
Just a bunch of bullshit about

26:31.034 --> 26:32.602
how he's takin' over
the law firm,

26:32.602 --> 26:34.170
and forcin' his partner out.

26:34.170 --> 26:36.639
<i>Him and some headstrong guy
named Gary.</i>

26:36.639 --> 26:38.074
You don't say?

26:38.074 --> 26:40.143
Yeah, then he started talkin'
about this guy Zac,

26:40.143 --> 26:43.179
and how he's gonna sue him for
takin' his ex.

26:44.214 --> 26:45.248
Okay...

26:45.248 --> 26:47.016
Not funny.

26:47.016 --> 26:48.351
Did he mention an ex?

26:48.351 --> 26:49.619
No.

26:49.619 --> 26:52.288
Just that she's still
in love with him.

26:52.288 --> 26:53.456
Wow.

26:53.456 --> 26:54.891
Wow, this guy's...

26:55.491 --> 26:56.893
Okay, thank you.

26:56.893 --> 27:00.330
Yeah, I'll keep you posted.
Oh, shit...

27:00.663 --> 27:02.532
Wait, girl, I forgot
to tell you.

27:02.532 --> 27:04.934
<i>This -- wears socks
in his pants.</i>

27:05.568 --> 27:06.703
I'm sorry, what?

27:06.703 --> 27:08.671
To make his thing look like
it's big!

27:08.671 --> 27:11.841
Okay, you know, Tamara, I don't
need to know all that.

27:11.841 --> 27:12.942
Yeah.

27:12.942 --> 27:14.344
Well, I'm just tellin' you
everything.

27:14.344 --> 27:16.479
Okay, well, thank you.

27:16.479 --> 27:18.014
-[Tamara]<i> Sure.
</i>-Wow.

27:18.014 --> 27:19.415
<i>All right, girl.</i>

27:19.415 --> 27:22.585
So, when he walk up in there,
you gon' see how good I am.

27:22.585 --> 27:23.920
[Fatima]<i> Okay.</i>

27:24.787 --> 27:27.123
But real quick,
this may be too soon...

27:27.123 --> 27:28.157
[Tamara]<i> Okay.</i>

27:28.157 --> 27:30.260
[Fatima] He has a client
named Heather.

27:30.860 --> 27:32.595
I need him to drop her.

27:33.563 --> 27:36.065
Give me a week, he will be doin'
whatever I say.

27:36.499 --> 27:38.635
I like that.

27:38.902 --> 27:39.802
All right.

27:39.802 --> 27:41.170
I will talk to you later.

27:41.170 --> 27:42.171
Sure.

27:42.171 --> 27:43.873
-[Fatima]<i> Bye.
</i>-Bye.

27:46.976 --> 27:49.846
-Your plant, I assume?
-Yes, mm-hm.

27:50.847 --> 27:53.650
So, I had my cousin hook him up
with someone that I knew

27:53.650 --> 27:55.251
he couldn't resist.

27:55.251 --> 27:57.687
When I tell you she is playin'
his ass like a fiddle,

27:57.687 --> 27:59.055
and he's fallin' for it.

27:59.589 --> 28:00.823
I love it!

28:01.591 --> 28:03.159
Oh, man.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.496
Don't you think this is
a little...

28:06.496 --> 28:07.864
elaborate?

28:07.864 --> 28:09.632
Andi, I know.
I know it's low.

28:09.632 --> 28:10.900
[Andi] Mm-hm.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.402
But look, I didn't know what
else to do

28:12.402 --> 28:13.569
besides have this -- popped.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.905
If "popped" means what
I think it means,

28:15.905 --> 28:18.741
then you absolutely cannot do
that option.

28:18.741 --> 28:20.777
It does mean that,
so that's why I'm doing this.

28:20.777 --> 28:24.847
Well, if you could please just
remind me to never get

28:24.847 --> 28:26.549
on your bad side,
that would be great.

28:26.549 --> 28:29.786
Reminded, yes.
But...

28:29.786 --> 28:32.455
What is all this talk about
takin' over the hedge fund?

28:32.455 --> 28:34.390
Is that your Gary?

28:34.390 --> 28:35.825
Scary Gary?

28:35.825 --> 28:38.328
He's not Scary Gary.
Anyway...

28:39.629 --> 28:41.030
Yeah, they are...

28:41.030 --> 28:43.499
Trying to make some major moves.

28:43.499 --> 28:45.268
But you can't say anything.

28:45.268 --> 28:46.869
I, I never do.
No.

28:46.869 --> 28:48.438
[Andi] They're trying to force
Robin out.

28:48.438 --> 28:52.909
And I just found out that Hayden
is very heavily involved.

28:53.509 --> 28:54.610
Which is...

28:54.610 --> 28:56.412
-Good to know.
-[Fatima] Hmm...

28:56.412 --> 28:57.981
Good to know what
I'm dealing with.

28:57.981 --> 28:59.015
Well...

28:59.015 --> 29:00.883
Do you think they'll
be able to do it?

29:02.151 --> 29:03.219
I don't know.

29:04.387 --> 29:06.122
So are you gonna tell Robin?

29:07.790 --> 29:09.125
He's a smart man.

29:09.959 --> 29:11.694

29:12.295 --> 29:14.097
-Okay.

-Okay.
-[Danni] I do not.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.655
I was wondering if
I could come by.

32:33.655 --> 32:35.223
To your house.

32:35.857 --> 32:37.325
Excuse me?

32:37.325 --> 32:41.463
Well, maybe get some takeout,

32:42.564 --> 32:45.267
Don't you have to be somewhere
by a certain time,

32:45.267 --> 32:47.102
that ankle bracelet on your leg?

32:47.102 --> 32:49.638
Yeah, but I'm working,
so as long as I'm here

32:49.638 --> 32:52.307

it should all be good, you know?

32:53.141 --> 32:54.109
Mm-hm.

32:54.709 --> 32:55.544
What'd you do?

32:56.645 --> 32:57.879
What do you mean?

32:57.879 --> 32:59.214
You never told me what
you did to get

32:59.214 --> 33:01.016
that bracelet on your leg there.

33:04.986 --> 33:06.621
I got into a fight, and...

33:07.088 --> 33:08.890
I beat up this dude really bad

33:08.890 --> 33:10.525
for attacking somebody
that I love.

33:10.525 --> 33:12.827
Mm.
Yeah?

33:12.827 --> 33:14.229
[Que] Yeah.

33:14.229 --> 33:16.498
So, you went to jail for
a woman?

33:17.399 --> 33:18.533

33:27.542 --> 33:28.877
And I'll do it again.

33:29.511 --> 33:30.579
I see.

33:32.547 --> 33:33.615
You don't believe me?

33:35.984 --> 33:38.320
You don't have social media.

Drinkin', smokin'.

Can I come over?

34:20.795 --> 34:21.930

34:22.664 --> 34:24.199
I'm done with drama.

34:24.933 --> 34:26.334
I'm not into no drama.

34:27.002 --> 34:29.771
Something, I don't know what...

34:29.771 --> 34:32.173
Something tells me that you are.

You think I'm playin' your game?

36:07.402 --> 36:08.670
Excuse me?

36:08.670 --> 36:11.673
The one where you stay out
all hours of the night,

36:11.673 --> 36:13.808
and then pretend that you text
me to let me know?

36:13.808 --> 36:15.810
Can we just not do that today?

36:15.810 --> 36:16.745
[Karen] Okay.

[Karen] Why not?

37:34.255 --> 37:36.257
You have to have your lawyer
look at that, at least.

37:36.257 --> 37:37.625
I don't need one.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.428
Look, Zac...

37:42.030 --> 37:43.698
Karen, I can't take that
