00:06.707 --> 00:10.241
Hey, Angus!
I need to talk to you.

00:10.241 --> 00:11.142
(INHALES SHARPLY)

00:11.142 --> 00:11.782
Whee!

00:14.345 --> 00:16.087
Okay. Two things.
One, bless you.

00:16.087 --> 00:20.321
And two, what the heck
kind of sneeze was that?

00:20.321 --> 00:23.654
That wasn't a sneeze.
I don't sneeze like that.
I'm a man!

00:24.695 --> 00:27.298
Whee!

00:27.298 --> 00:31.702
(CHUCKLES) Okay, well,
cover your mouth
when you "don't sneeze"!

00:31.702 --> 00:35.106
Anyway, I have
a great idea
for a new app.

00:35.106 --> 00:36.437
Here we go.

00:36.437 --> 00:39.170
Everyone thinks they have
a great idea for an app.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.512
It's like, "I'm just trying
to have lunch here, Mom,

00:41.512 --> 00:42.743
"and now you've
made it awkward."

00:45.376 --> 00:48.779
Do you even know
the first thing
about writing software?

00:48.779 --> 00:51.122
How hard can it be?

00:51.122 --> 00:55.626
How hard can it be?
Really hard! Harder than
writing some silly song!

00:55.626 --> 00:59.460
Well, I'll have you know
that my dub-step remix
of Silly Song

00:59.460 --> 01:03.234
is huge in Taiwan!
(SCOFFS)

01:03.234 --> 01:05.796
Chyna! There you are!
We have major problems!

01:05.796 --> 01:08.799
Listen to this.
We are under attack!

01:08.799 --> 01:11.502
(BEEPS)
 (HARP PLAYING)

01:11.502 --> 01:15.506
We're being
attacked by angels?

01:15.506 --> 01:17.678
No! Hashimoto Mobile
has come out

01:17.678 --> 01:19.780
with the most downloaded
text alert in history.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.284
That's why I need
my musical prodigy

01:23.284 --> 01:26.257
to compose the catchiest,
most memorable
text alert ever.

01:26.257 --> 01:29.190
(LAUGHS) Cool!
I would love to do it.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.293
(HARP PLAYING)

01:32.293 --> 01:33.594
I think you
just got a text.

01:35.866 --> 01:37.498
No, I didn't.

01:37.498 --> 01:39.800
Which can only
mean one thing.

01:39.800 --> 01:40.801
(SCREAMS) People!

01:40.801 --> 01:44.505
We are under
attack by angels!

01:45.336 --> 01:46.707
Prepare yourselves!

01:46.707 --> 01:51.782

is about to become
a living heaven!

01:55.746 --> 01:56.817
(PHONE BEEPS)

01:56.817 --> 01:59.250
My mistake.
I did get a text.

02:00.451 --> 02:02.553
From Dr. Novine.

02:02.553 --> 02:05.526
He wants to cancel
my counseling session today.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.858
Oh, text him back.

I'm all out

03:30.311 --> 03:32.543
I've read all my textbooks,
all the books in the library,

the entire Internet.

03:34.915 --> 03:38.589

how about I give
you a brain teaser?

03:52.603 --> 03:55.806

You know a brain teaser?

03:55.806 --> 03:57.568
How quaint.

03:57.568 --> 03:59.440
Okay, let's get this
over with.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.842
Lay it on me,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.776
Okay. In an

04:05.776 --> 04:08.619
Anthony and Cleopatra
are lying dead.

04:08.619 --> 04:09.950
Caesar stands
over them.

04:09.950 --> 04:14.325
Nearby is a broken glass,
and the floor is wet.

04:14.325 --> 04:15.756
Caesar never laid
a hand on them

04:15.756 --> 04:16.857
and they have not
been poisoned.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.928
How did they die?

Olive?

04:24.595 --> 04:26.597
Yes, Fletcher?

the answer?

04:28.699 --> 04:30.301
I'm thinking.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.272
Do you want a hint?

04:32.272 --> 04:34.004
No, I don't
want a hint!

04:34.004 --> 04:35.806
Hints are for the weak
and the witless!

04:35.806 --> 04:37.948
When have you
ever known me
to take a hint?

04:37.948 --> 04:41.812
Certainly not two minutes
ago when I ignored
three of your sighs.

04:46.457 --> 04:49.890
Okay, Mr. Grundy, I think
you're really going to like

05:14.314 --> 05:16.887

I cried out, "Mother!

"Mother!

with the riddle?

09:31.972 --> 09:34.605

how Anthony and Cleopatra
died yet?

09:34.605 --> 09:37.077
I think so.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.309
I've been doing
a lot of research on the
history of ancient Egypt,

09:39.309 --> 09:42.683
and I think I have
discovered a little-known
interesting factoid

09:42.683 --> 09:44.915
by examining
these hieroglyphs.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.889
(COUGHING)

09:48.889 --> 09:55.365
The Land of the Pharaohs
was devastated by a terrible
plague in 30 B.C.,

09:55.365 --> 09:58.799
so Anthony and Cleopatra
must have died after
getting horribly sick!

09:58.799 --> 10:02.903
See? This is the
ancient Egyptian symbol
for projectile vomiting.

10:05.175 --> 10:06.376
Where'd you get that?

10:06.376 --> 10:07.878
From the museum.

10:07.878 --> 10:09.039
You mean
the gift shop, right?

10:09.980 --> 10:12.382
Okay.

10:12.382 --> 10:15.015
I can't believe
you can't solve this riddle!

10:15.015 --> 10:17.347
It's so simple.
I got the answer
in two seconds.

10:17.347 --> 10:20.691
If you got it,
then maybe I just
need to think like you.

10:20.691 --> 10:23.794
"Duh, Cleopatra
go sleep-sleep!"

10:26.626 --> 10:28.829
Olive, do you know
where my blue jacket is?

10:28.829 --> 10:31.231
(SCREAMS) I can't
solve any more
mysteries right now!

10:31.231 --> 10:33.633

is going to explode!

10:34.765 --> 10:36.406
Oh! Here it is.

10:36.406 --> 10:38.068
Underneath this
worthless old rock.

(SHATTERING)

10:40.640 --> 10:44.214
Ahhh!

10:44.214 --> 10:46.747
Don't worry. You can
just get another one
at the gift shop.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.379
Right. Gift shop.

10:55.826 --> 10:58.158
Angus, what are
you doing in here?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.691
I'm a musical genius.

11:00.691 --> 11:02.062
I need to be around
these musical

11:02.893 --> 11:04.695
doodads.

11:04.695 --> 11:07.698
But you don't
even know what any
of these instruments are.

11:07.698 --> 11:08.098
Sure I do.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.071
The hobo.

11:12.803 --> 11:15.205
The weird hanger.

11:16.346 --> 11:19.209
And the French-dip horn.

11:19.209 --> 11:22.312
It's called the French horn,
not the French-dip horn.

11:22.312 --> 11:25.355
Then explain why there's
a roast beef sandwich in it.

11:30.090 --> 11:34.224
Yo! Guys! You got to
get up on this organic
honeybell mustard.

11:35.465 --> 11:37.968
You don't know
anything about music.

11:37.968 --> 11:39.329
Or French-dip sandwiches.

11:39.329 --> 11:42.773
You want to use
a spicy mustard,
not a sweet mustard.

11:42.773 --> 11:45.305
Well, if I don't know
anything about music,

11:45.305 --> 11:48.038
then why did Mr. Grundy
ask me to write a song

11:48.038 --> 11:50.040
for all the new
zPhone commercials?

11:50.040 --> 11:52.712
What? How could that be?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.245
I'm the musical prodigy!
This makes no sense!

11:55.245 --> 11:57.447
Can we talk
about this later?
I'm eating.

11:57.447 --> 11:58.819
Old napkin!

12:01.291 --> 12:02.492
New napkin!

12:06.296 --> 12:09.129
Lexi? You joined
Angus's entourage?

12:09.129 --> 12:11.161
But you don't
even like Angus.

12:11.161 --> 12:14.935
I know. But I weighed
how little I like
to spend time with Angus

12:14.935 --> 12:16.366
against how much I knew
this would irritate you.

12:16.366 --> 12:20.140
Looking at your face now,
I see I made the right choice!

12:24.915 --> 12:26.216
(SNIFFING)

12:31.151 --> 12:34.084
Olive?
 (GRUNTING) Yeah?

12:34.084 --> 12:36.056
What are you doing?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.789
I'm doing what all great
sleuths do when they are
momentarily stumped.

12:38.789 --> 12:42.933
Forget to bathe
and descend into
madness?

12:42.933 --> 12:45.765
No! Lay out all the clues

12:45.765 --> 12:49.800
and then approach them
with the cold, calculating
focus of a TV detective.

12:49.800 --> 12:50.100
Hello!

12:53.773 --> 12:55.275
I can't believe
you don't know
the answer and I do.

12:55.275 --> 13:00.380
Me! The person you're
always making fun of
for being dumb.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.353
Well, who's dumber now?

13:05.215 --> 13:09.059
Yeah. Why do you
know the answer?

13:09.059 --> 13:10.921
It's not 'cause
you're smart.

13:10.921 --> 13:12.923
Maybe you did it!

13:12.923 --> 13:14.825
Maybe you killed
Anthony and Cleopatra
and framed Caesar.

13:14.825 --> 13:19.129
Admit it! You killed them
because they found out
about your pyramid scheme!

13:27.037 --> 13:31.511
Uh, so, Angus,
now that you're
a musical maestro,

13:31.511 --> 13:34.014
why don't you...
 Hold that thought.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.045
(SHOUTS) Old eye crust!

13:39.819 --> 13:42.292
New eye crust!

13:48.828 --> 13:50.560
Why would you ask
for new eye crust?

13:51.401 --> 13:52.933
Because I can.

13:53.463 --> 13:55.465
You were saying?

13:55.465 --> 13:58.138
I was saying I'd love
to hear the music
you've come up with

13:58.138 --> 14:00.440
for Mr. Grundy's
new ad campaign.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.242
Well, I don't have
anything yet,

14:02.242 --> 14:05.946
but just like
my text alert,
it'll come to me.

14:06.977 --> 14:09.980
It's not hard
like writing an app.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.121
Or trying to use
one of these weird hangers.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.528
Okay, I get it.

14:18.528 --> 14:21.531
I'm sorry I said
writing an app was easy.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.994
But just admit
you didn't write
any music.

14:23.994 --> 14:26.937
(SNORTS) Of course I did.

14:26.937 --> 14:28.899
But you just sneezed!

14:28.899 --> 14:31.141
And it sounded like
a baby leprechaun
on a teeter-totter.

14:31.141 --> 14:33.103
"Whee!"

14:33.103 --> 14:37.948
Chyna, I know
you're stuck on your old,
boring ideas of music

14:37.948 --> 14:41.081
made with musical doodads...

14:41.081 --> 14:44.614
Instruments!
They're called instruments!

14:44.614 --> 14:46.386
Whatever!

14:47.958 --> 14:49.489
But what you
mistook for a sneeze

14:49.489 --> 14:51.421
was actually
a new form of music
I call

14:52.192 --> 14:54.164
nasal singing.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.527
Ah. My mistake.

14:57.527 --> 15:02.232
In fact, since you
made such beautiful
music with your nose,

15:02.232 --> 15:04.474
maybe you should
compose the song
for Mr. Grundy

15:04.474 --> 15:08.608
using the, uh, other sounds
that come out of your body.

15:09.479 --> 15:11.982
There are a lot of them.

15:14.644 --> 15:16.286
Yeah! I'm
gonna do it!
 (ELEVATOR DINGS)

15:16.286 --> 15:17.617
(CHUCKLES)

15:19.990 --> 15:23.393
Mr. Grundy?
You joined
his entourage?

15:23.393 --> 15:26.997
What? I am the CEO
of a multi-billion-dollar
corporation.

15:26.997 --> 15:29.629
I don't have time
to be in an entourage.

15:29.629 --> 15:33.563
Besides, I'm already
in a crew, a posse,
and a sewing circle.

15:35.205 --> 15:38.068
Where do you think
I made this dope track suit?

15:38.068 --> 15:41.371
So, Sparky,
how is my song coming?

15:41.371 --> 15:42.572
Am I going to love it?

15:42.572 --> 15:44.344
(CHUCKLING)
Trust me,

15:44.344 --> 15:47.547
you're going to be
knocked out by his
body of work.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.219
I can't wait
to hear it.

15:49.219 --> 15:52.482
But I'll have to,
because if you're late
for sewing circle,

15:52.482 --> 15:54.954
they bad-mouth you
on a pillow.

15:56.000 --> 16:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:06.436 --> 16:09.539
Chyna, are you
up here crying?

16:09.539 --> 16:10.970
You shouldn't be alone.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.472
I want to watch.

16:13.343 --> 16:15.075
I'm not crying.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.348
But Mr. Grundy's eyes
are gonna water
when he hears Angus' song.

16:18.348 --> 16:20.480
Trust me.
It's gonna stink.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.483
What did you do?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.417
I just tricked Angus
into writing a zPhone song
that is so embarrassing,

16:27.417 --> 16:29.659
he's going to make
a huge fool of himself.

16:29.659 --> 16:33.723
Chyna, that is evil.
Unforgivably evil.

16:33.723 --> 16:36.426
I'm so proud of you!

16:36.426 --> 16:40.400
No! I'm not being evil.
I'm teaching Angus a lesson.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.533
(SIGHS) He's a fraud
and he does not deserve
the success he's getting.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.105
I deserve it.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.378
That's exactly how I feel
about all your successes!

16:48.378 --> 16:50.280
We're like
the same person!

16:50.280 --> 16:53.083
Seriously, it's like
I'm looking in a mirror.

16:53.783 --> 16:54.384
Well, a funhouse mirror.

16:56.086 --> 16:59.249
That's not very fun.

16:59.249 --> 17:02.652
I think you're overstating it.
All I did was a little prank.

17:02.652 --> 17:06.656
You call embarrassing Angus
in front of millions of people
"a little prank?"

17:06.656 --> 17:10.099
Wait. What do you mean,
"millions of people"?

17:10.099 --> 17:11.461
Mr. Grundy decided
to debut Angus's song

17:11.461 --> 17:14.534
at the big
Z-Tech presentation.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.366
It's being streamed live
all over the world!

17:16.366 --> 17:18.808
What? Well, when
does it start?

17:18.808 --> 17:20.140
Thursday.
 (SIGHS)

17:20.140 --> 17:20.670
This Thursday.

17:20.670 --> 17:22.142
Today.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.414
It's happening right now.

17:28.618 --> 17:31.781
As you know,
our theme park,
Z-Land,

17:31.781 --> 17:34.324
has been closed since 2003

17:34.324 --> 17:38.688
when it was discovered
that the haunted house
was really haunted,

17:38.688 --> 17:39.389
by asbestos.

17:41.531 --> 17:43.333
But we are proud
to finally announce

17:43.333 --> 17:47.667
the opening next year
of New Z-Land.

17:51.241 --> 17:54.073
What do you mean,
the name's taken?

17:54.073 --> 17:59.279
Anyway, here to perform
the song for the new
zPhone ad campaign,

17:59.279 --> 18:02.382
the genius behind
our best-selling text alert,

18:04.614 --> 18:06.686
Big Guy!

18:11.291 --> 18:15.625
My murderer
walks the Earth
unpunished!

18:15.625 --> 18:18.528
While I,
the queen of Egypt,

18:18.528 --> 18:21.631
am tormented
by a cockamamie riddle!

18:21.631 --> 18:25.475
Olive, there's something
different about you.

18:25.475 --> 18:26.836
Have you lost weight?

18:26.836 --> 18:30.310
Or your mind?

18:30.310 --> 18:32.742
I figured if I act out
the riddle, the answer
will present itself.

18:32.742 --> 18:36.246
I'm Cleopatra.
You're Anthony.
Lie down, you're dead.

18:36.246 --> 18:37.387
How did I die?

18:37.387 --> 18:39.118
That's what I'm trying
to figure out!

18:40.820 --> 18:44.294
Look. I'm sorry
I told you this riddle.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.356
Or ever met you.

18:46.356 --> 18:48.127
Can I please
just tell you the answer?

18:48.127 --> 18:52.502
Never! I've been
trying to solve this
non-stop for days!

18:52.502 --> 18:54.764
Maybe Cleopatra was
having a drink of water,

18:54.764 --> 18:58.838
dropped the glass,
which startled a basket
full of venomous snakes,

18:58.838 --> 19:00.840
which leapt out
and devoured
Anthony's face.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.443
(SNAKES HISSING)

19:03.443 --> 19:04.914
Where did you
get real snakes?

19:04.914 --> 19:06.576
From a zoo

19:06.576 --> 19:08.348
...'s gift shop.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.781
(SNAKES HISSING)
 (SCREAMS) Look! Look!

19:11.781 --> 19:14.284
Cleopatra and Anthony
were goldfish in a bowl,

19:14.284 --> 19:16.886
which was knocked over
by a cat named Caesar!

19:18.888 --> 19:22.532
What bowl?
You said there was
a broken glass on the floor.

19:22.532 --> 19:25.495
No, there's broken glass
on the floor.

19:25.495 --> 19:27.397
(SHRIEKING) You said
"a" broken glass!

19:27.397 --> 19:31.471
Did I? Huh.
Potato, tomato.

19:32.902 --> 19:35.305
I've limited my thinking
to it being "a" broken glass!

19:37.877 --> 19:40.380
Olive, what are you
getting so upset about?

19:40.380 --> 19:43.883
So I said "a" glass. Big deal.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.816
Right. Let's move on
to a new riddle.

19:46.816 --> 19:50.390
A boy is found stuffed
in a basket full of snakes.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.591
Who put him there?

19:51.591 --> 19:52.322
I did.

19:54.524 --> 19:59.569
(SNAKES HISSING)

19:59.569 --> 20:03.473
Ugh! Where is the Roomavator?
What does this button even do?

20:13.243 --> 20:14.814
(SNAKES HISSING)

20:14.814 --> 20:17.947
(HAWKING PHLEGM)

20:17.947 --> 20:19.689
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

20:21.421 --> 20:26.296
(SNORTING)

20:28.558 --> 20:29.829
(POPS)

20:30.930 --> 20:32.702
Oh...

20:32.702 --> 20:35.365
(HAWKING CONTINUES)
 This is the worst thing
I have ever seen.

20:35.365 --> 20:37.737
And I've seen you
star in a musical.

20:38.568 --> 20:40.440
I've got to help him.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.873
(CHUCKLES) Hello,
ladies and gentlemen!

20:43.873 --> 20:46.716
I know what
you're thinking.

20:46.716 --> 20:49.519
It appears that this
poor guy is just up here
completely humiliating himself

20:49.519 --> 20:53.983
by making random
and disgusting bodily noises.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.485
(GLEEFULLY)
Because he is!

20:56.886 --> 20:58.458
(WHISPERING)
What are you doing?

20:58.458 --> 20:59.589
I'm saving you.

20:59.589 --> 21:03.293
(CHUCKLES) Folks,
what he is in fact doing

21:03.293 --> 21:04.834
is showing you how,
with the new zPhone,

21:04.834 --> 21:09.699
you can take disgusting
noises and turn them
into beautiful music.

21:09.699 --> 21:13.272
So, how about
a little bit more
of that nasal singing?

21:13.272 --> 21:14.844
(SNEEZE BUILDING)

21:14.844 --> 21:16.446
Whee!

21:16.446 --> 21:19.809
Now, add
a little hiccup!
 (BEEPS)

21:19.809 --> 21:21.511
(HICCUPS)

21:21.511 --> 21:23.783
Now, hit me
with the phlegm!
 (BEEPS)

21:23.783 --> 21:25.715
(SNORTS)

21:25.715 --> 21:28.988
Now smooth it all out
with a little bit
of mellow armpit.

21:30.620 --> 21:31.621
(SQUELCHING)

21:31.621 --> 21:36.526

with just a few taps...

(HICCUPPING AND SQUELCHING

22:05.895 --> 22:08.758

His name is Angus.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.735
And I agree.
Great song, Angus.

(HUFFS)
 ANGUS: Huh! It really was.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.369
Thanks, Chyna.
You saved me.
 (GIGGLES)

22:21.340 --> 22:23.643
I'm sorry I acted
like a jerk.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.476
And I'm sorry
I tricked you into coming
up here and doing this.

22:26.476 --> 22:27.647
Look, I never
should have...

22:28.618 --> 22:31.451
(SNEEZE BUILDING)

22:31.451 --> 22:32.422
Whee!

22:33.853 --> 22:36.586
You know, you should
really cover your mouth.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.558
Because I...
I think I'm...
I'm catching your...

(SNEEZE BUILDING)

22:40.860 --> 22:41.391

Ah-choo!
(WARBLING IN HIGH PITCH)

22:55.445 --> 22:57.807
What? No one's going
to say gesundheit?

23:01.911 --> 23:05.384
Silly Song Two, Sillier Song
 recording session, take one.
