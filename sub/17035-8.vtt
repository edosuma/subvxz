00:29.732 --> 00:30.797
- Boss man!
- Mike!

00:30.799 --> 00:32.165
Mike, you okay?

00:32.167 --> 00:34.093
I got it, I got it. I'm fine.

00:34.095 --> 00:35.669
That was a big fall!

00:35.671 --> 00:37.137
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

00:37.139 --> 00:39.573
You want me to get you
some ointment for that?

00:39.575 --> 00:41.274
Dude, you really ate gravel.

00:41.276 --> 00:42.876
What did you trip on?

00:42.878 --> 00:44.377
I mean, physically.

00:44.379 --> 00:46.046
Well, I didn't trip. It's...

00:46.048 --> 00:48.181
There's something wrong
with the step, or...

00:48.183 --> 00:49.582
maybe it was a rock.

00:49.584 --> 00:51.617
It just seemed like you forgot
how to walk for a second.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.619
That happens to my mom sometimes.

00:53.621 --> 00:54.720
She's 78.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.984
Do you have a concussion?!

00:55.986 --> 00:58.591
I got one when I dived
into that dry pool!

00:58.593 --> 01:00.491
Yeah, somebody should really
drive you home.

01:00.516 --> 01:02.128
I got room on my dirt bike.

01:02.130 --> 01:05.165
No, I can take him.
Then I can sew up those pants.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.067
No one's getting near my pants.
Just go back to work.

01:07.069 --> 01:08.501
But it's the end of the day!

01:08.503 --> 01:09.936
Then just go home.

01:14.576 --> 01:17.081
It's hard to see your heroes fall.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.646
Nope, Axl wasn't there, either.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.248
Sorry it took so long.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.583
Gamma Phi was having a Casino Night,

01:24.585 --> 01:26.751
and I was on fire at the craps table.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.620
I've always been a good dice roller.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.089
Okay.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.591
Next stop, there's a party at
the Foreign Student Center...

01:32.593 --> 01:34.059
a "mutual understanding mixer."

01:34.061 --> 01:35.594
I think they're serving shawarma.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.595
All right, let's do it.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.762
I don't know what shawarma is,

01:37.764 --> 01:39.264
but I'm ready to mutually understand it.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.367
So, why are you so desperate
to find your brother?

01:42.369 --> 01:43.602
Mm, it's awful.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.237
He and my mom are estranged.

01:45.239 --> 01:48.106
Actually, he's not really
talking to any of the family.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.707
Yikes. What happened?

01:49.709 --> 01:51.275
He's dating this girl nobody likes,

01:51.277 --> 01:53.344
and my mom blurted out
that she doesn't like her,

01:53.346 --> 01:55.613
so he got mad and he didn't
come home for Thanksgiving.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.348
And now Christmas
is right around the corner,

01:57.350 --> 01:59.071
and I'm worried he won't
come home for that, either.

01:59.073 --> 02:00.457
Oh, he's got to come home for Christmas.

02:00.459 --> 02:02.886
I mean, Santa goes through all
that trouble to bring presents.

02:02.888 --> 02:04.222
Uhoh, got to stop.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.290
Tipsy Kappa Lambda at 10:00.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.758
Sorry.

02:10.295 --> 02:11.895
Dad, are you walking funny?

02:11.897 --> 02:14.132
Brick, are you eating funny?
Go to school.

02:15.419 --> 02:17.535
Hey, Brick.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.069
How does this sound?

02:19.071 --> 02:20.738
I'm about to call in sick.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.372
You know, with this whole Axl thing,

02:22.374 --> 02:24.341
I just really need a mental-health day.

02:25.410 --> 02:26.744
I want to make sure it sounds real.

02:26.746 --> 02:28.145
Would you tell me not to come in?

02:28.759 --> 02:30.050
You're burying the cough.

02:30.052 --> 02:32.215
If you want it to land,
you got to put it at the end.

02:32.217 --> 02:35.252
Nice. I like the way you think.

02:36.588 --> 02:39.089
Rita! What a surprise.

02:39.091 --> 02:40.590
Just so you know, it wasn't me

02:40.592 --> 02:42.259
who called in
that noise complaint last week.

02:42.261 --> 02:44.662
Who doesn't love AC/DC at 2:00 a.m.?

02:44.664 --> 02:46.563
I need you to drive me someplace.

02:46.565 --> 02:48.198
Oh. I would love to,

02:48.200 --> 02:50.400
but I'm actually really sick.

02:50.402 --> 02:52.369
You didn't sound sick a second ago.

02:52.371 --> 02:54.737
Okay, I'm not sick,
but I have to get to work.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.706
No, you don't.
Just sleep with your boss.

02:56.708 --> 02:58.175
Then you can come and go as you please.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.143
I'm at work right now. So, let's go.

03:00.145 --> 03:01.211
Ticktock, princess.

03:01.213 --> 03:02.879
Come on. I don't got all day.

03:02.881 --> 03:05.114
- Can't one of your boys take you?
- They're all lazy.

03:05.116 --> 03:07.484
I thought they'd grow up
and chip in, but no.

03:07.486 --> 03:09.018
I'm the only one out there

03:09.020 --> 03:11.221
stripping copper
out of abandoned houses.

03:11.223 --> 03:14.057
I told them, cereal don't grow on trees.

03:14.059 --> 03:17.093
Look, my boss is a real jerk
if I'm late, so...

03:17.095 --> 03:20.163
You know, I'm still emotionally
and somewhat physically scarred

03:20.165 --> 03:22.298
from when you attacked me
last Halloween.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.600
Now, I didn't press charges,
but I could.

03:24.602 --> 03:27.070
You know why I didn't?
'Cause I'm a good neighbor.

03:27.072 --> 03:31.040
I assume you'd want to
recip-i-cate my good intentions.

03:31.042 --> 03:34.376
Or you can just give me
the keys to your car.

03:36.047 --> 03:37.747
Okay, here we go.

03:38.850 --> 03:40.016
So, where to?

03:40.018 --> 03:41.084
Just drive.

03:41.086 --> 03:43.619
I'll tell you which way to go.

03:43.621 --> 03:45.254
Hey!

03:45.256 --> 03:46.288
Trust me.

03:46.290 --> 03:49.125
You want to be real careful with that.

03:49.127 --> 03:51.127
Oh. Uh, wwhat... what's in there?

03:51.129 --> 03:52.995
None of your damn business.

03:52.997 --> 03:54.563
Cheez-It?

03:54.565 --> 03:56.898
Oh.

03:56.900 --> 04:02.904
I said one.

04:05.642 --> 04:07.375
Mike, you're here.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.710
How's your foot?

04:08.712 --> 04:11.179
How's <i> your</i> foot? Mine's great.

04:11.181 --> 04:12.881
Am I missing something?
What are you guys talking about?

04:12.883 --> 04:14.182
Mike fell so bad!

04:14.184 --> 04:15.283
I didn't fall.

04:15.285 --> 04:17.485
I just misstepped. It's not a big deal.

04:17.487 --> 04:19.320
Wait. It happened here?

04:19.322 --> 04:21.189
What is this?
A place we sit around gossiping

04:21.190 --> 04:22.657
or a place where we blow stuff up?

04:22.659 --> 04:23.658
Get out there.

04:23.660 --> 04:24.960
I'm the safety officer.

04:24.962 --> 04:27.428
If there's an accident
that happens at the quarry,

04:27.430 --> 04:28.663
I got to report it.

04:28.665 --> 04:30.798
Got to follow the rules.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.133
Rules, man.

04:32.135 --> 04:34.702
Oh, now the government
wants to control our falling.

04:34.704 --> 04:36.771
You fall all you want, boss man.

04:36.773 --> 04:39.440
'Course, you'll never be able
to top a fall like that again.

04:39.442 --> 04:40.608
That was pretty epic.

04:40.610 --> 04:42.443
It was like he was swimming in the air.

04:42.445 --> 04:43.878
It seemed to go on forever.

04:43.880 --> 04:44.879
I kept thinking,

04:44.881 --> 04:46.547
"Shouldn't he be on the ground by now?"

04:46.549 --> 04:47.848
And then he was!

04:47.850 --> 04:50.351
Sorry, Mike, I got no choice.
I got to report it.

04:50.353 --> 04:52.520
Well, maybe I'll report you
for standing around bugging me

04:52.522 --> 04:53.988
when you should be out there working.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.991
I'm gonna have to report
that attitude, too.

04:56.993 --> 04:58.225
Get out of here.

05:01.397 --> 05:03.397
'Kay, turn right up ahead.

05:03.399 --> 05:05.599
But that takes us onto the highway.

05:05.601 --> 05:07.134
No duh. That's how we get there.

05:07.136 --> 05:08.936
O-O-Okay, look, I'm sorry, but I thought

05:08.938 --> 05:11.338
I was just dropping you off
at the store or the doctor's

05:11.340 --> 05:12.840
or the courthouse or something.

05:12.842 --> 05:13.841
You're gonna miss it!

05:17.905 --> 05:19.584
I'm not sure
what Axl's class schedule is,

05:19.609 --> 05:21.609
but he's a business major,
so let's try Hubbard Hall.

05:21.611 --> 05:22.809
- On it.
- Excuse me.

05:22.811 --> 05:25.025
You're also going by
the journalism building

05:25.065 --> 05:26.064
to drop me off, right?

05:26.066 --> 05:27.333
He doesn't look drunk.

05:27.335 --> 05:29.168
Oh, during the day,
we give rides to injured people.

05:29.170 --> 05:30.569
This happened when I was drunk.

05:30.571 --> 05:31.737
Oh.

05:31.739 --> 05:33.572
I accidentally one time
had a sip of hard lemonade

05:33.574 --> 05:37.243
and I twerked, so I understand
the dangers of alcohol.

05:37.719 --> 05:38.884
I think the thing you want to do is...

05:38.886 --> 05:39.884
Axl!

05:39.886 --> 05:41.385
Axl, stop! Wait.

05:41.387 --> 05:43.989
That's him! That's him! Follow him!

05:43.991 --> 05:45.724
Go, go, go, go, go! Floor it!

05:45.726 --> 05:46.891
Axl, stop!

05:46.893 --> 05:48.392
I just want to talk to you!

05:48.394 --> 05:50.095
Um, excuse me, journalism class?

05:50.097 --> 05:52.263
Journalism's dead! Start a blog!

05:52.265 --> 05:54.165
Axl!

05:54.167 --> 05:55.967
Axl!

05:55.969 --> 05:59.638
Ax-l-l-l-l-l!

06:00.674 --> 06:03.108
What the hell's going on?

06:03.110 --> 06:05.043
Oh, Mike, this is Tom Hanson,

06:05.045 --> 06:06.945
our OSHA compliance officer.

06:06.947 --> 06:09.080
Hello, Mr. Heck.
Are you the injured party?

06:09.082 --> 06:10.515
There is no injured party.

06:10.517 --> 06:11.650
I'm not injured.

06:11.652 --> 06:12.984
What about your ankle?

06:12.986 --> 06:14.051
It's nothing.

06:14.053 --> 06:16.220
As I told my soonto-be-former employee,

06:16.222 --> 06:17.888
my foot just landed wrong.

06:17.890 --> 06:20.158
- It stretched in the back.
- Ah, yes.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.126
Yeah, we call that one
the "high heel" injury.

06:22.128 --> 06:24.395
Uh, no, I think
it's an old football injury.

06:24.397 --> 06:26.764
And just to be clear,
I was wearing work boots.

06:26.766 --> 06:27.765
Uh-huh.

06:27.767 --> 06:28.932
Attention, Team B.

06:28.934 --> 06:31.269
Please report
to the administrative trailer.

06:31.271 --> 06:33.923
Look, this was just a dumb thing.

06:33.925 --> 06:35.187
It's not a big deal.

06:35.189 --> 06:36.807
We just have to stop talking about it.

06:36.809 --> 06:37.975
With all due respect,

06:37.977 --> 06:39.930
you should never
stop talking about safety.

06:40.580 --> 06:41.646
Hello, everyone.

06:41.648 --> 06:43.781
Due to Mr. Heck's recent incident,

06:43.783 --> 06:47.017
we're gonna take time right now
to do a safe-stair drill.

06:47.019 --> 06:48.318
Aw, come on!

06:48.320 --> 06:50.467
- He can do that?
- Mr. Heck, could you come here?

06:50.469 --> 06:51.627
You're gonna help me demonstrate.

06:54.452 --> 06:56.160
The most important thing to remember...

06:56.162 --> 06:59.296
always use the handrails.

07:00.800 --> 07:01.965
Now, for your first step,

07:01.967 --> 07:04.902
you're gonna want to use
your dominant foot.

07:06.371 --> 07:10.140
And do not... I repeat,
do not ever skip a step.

07:10.142 --> 07:13.077
Okay, Mr. Heck, let's see you
go up those stairs.

07:13.713 --> 07:15.245
Whoa, whoa!

07:15.247 --> 07:16.680
Slow down.

07:16.682 --> 07:18.582
Nothing is ever so urgent

07:18.584 --> 07:21.351
that you can't take the time to be safe.

07:21.353 --> 07:24.421
Now let's see you do it
the correct way coming down.

07:24.423 --> 07:25.522
Good.

07:25.524 --> 07:26.723
Very good.

07:26.725 --> 07:29.058
And you used the handrail
for the descent, also.

07:29.060 --> 07:30.059
I like that.

07:30.061 --> 07:31.552
- Done here?
- Nope.

07:31.554 --> 07:32.562
Not till everyone takes a turn.

07:32.564 --> 07:33.896
Let's line it up, boys.

07:37.969 --> 07:39.736
Hey, hey, hey, hot-dogger!

07:39.738 --> 07:42.071
Whole foot on the step.

07:44.909 --> 07:46.175
Oh!

07:46.177 --> 07:48.378
You can't tell the Chuck
what to do, government man!

07:49.514 --> 07:51.814
Fight the power! Unh!

07:52.884 --> 07:54.718
Get off me! Help!

07:54.720 --> 07:56.219
Axl, you listen to me!

07:56.221 --> 07:58.186
This conversation is happening,

07:58.188 --> 08:00.723
whether it happens now
or it happens later!

08:00.725 --> 08:02.758
I pick later! Now leave me alone!

08:02.760 --> 08:04.860
I didn't want to have to do this.

08:04.862 --> 08:05.861
Ow! Ow! Ow!

08:05.863 --> 08:07.195
Not the hair! Not the hair!

08:07.197 --> 08:08.697
That's my ticket to YouTube stardom!

08:08.699 --> 08:09.698
Come on! Okay, okay.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.367
I'm listening. I'm listening. Ah.

08:11.369 --> 08:12.668
Okay, look, Axl,

08:12.670 --> 08:16.338
I know Mom said some stuff
about April she shouldn't have,

08:16.340 --> 08:18.540
but our family is not so great

08:18.542 --> 08:21.543
that we can just afford to be
losing members left and right.

08:21.545 --> 08:23.514
Thanksgiving sucked,

08:23.516 --> 08:26.848
so please just promise me
you'll come home for Christmas.

08:27.705 --> 08:29.285
I can't make that promise.

08:29.287 --> 08:30.846
But you have to!

08:30.848 --> 08:33.419
We can't have our
family traditions without you.

08:33.615 --> 08:36.182
When we sing Christmas carols,
you're the one

08:36.183 --> 08:37.804
who tries to climb
out the window and ditch us.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.102
When I bake gingerbread men,

08:39.105 --> 08:41.138
you're the one
who bites all the heads off.

08:41.445 --> 08:43.145
So, what, are the Christmas villagers

08:43.147 --> 08:45.014
just not gonna
hump each other this year?

08:45.016 --> 08:46.557
If you're not there,

08:46.559 --> 08:48.851
Christmas is just gonna go smoothly.

08:48.853 --> 08:51.286
And that may be
some other family's Christmas,

08:51.288 --> 08:53.228
but it sure isn't ours.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.757
Well, you're gonna have to
find someone else

08:54.759 --> 08:56.125
to put boobs on the snowman,

08:56.127 --> 08:58.661
'cause I can't be with people
who hate my girlfriend.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.496
Okay, to be fair, Axl,

09:00.498 --> 09:03.533
we have been
nothing but nice to her face.

09:03.535 --> 09:05.902
Maybe we just need to get
to know her better,

09:05.904 --> 09:07.102
have a do-over.

09:07.104 --> 09:08.670
Sue, I'm 22.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.705
Maybe I just don't need
the family as much as you do.

09:10.707 --> 09:12.641
Maybe I just need a break from you guys.

09:13.710 --> 09:16.608
I don't think you're allowed to do that!

09:19.016 --> 09:20.249
Okay.

09:20.251 --> 09:22.851
Well, once everyone has signed
their Safe Stair Pledge,

09:22.853 --> 09:24.521
I'll have everything I need.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.639
Thank God.

09:25.641 --> 09:27.689
Hey, I found footage of Mike's fall

09:27.691 --> 09:29.229
from the security camera.

09:29.231 --> 09:31.226
It'll show us exactly what happened.

09:31.228 --> 09:32.428
No! No, it won't.

09:32.430 --> 09:33.929
Hey, why don't you shove
one of those doughnuts

09:33.931 --> 09:36.265
into your chatty mouth, Dave?

09:36.267 --> 09:37.732
Hold on a second.

09:38.415 --> 09:40.436
You fell yesterday, right?

09:40.438 --> 09:41.670
Yeah.

09:41.672 --> 09:43.304
Well, then, this number's wrong.

09:43.306 --> 09:46.074
Yeah, but that wasn't really
a w-workplace injury.

09:46.076 --> 09:47.641
That was just my own dumb thing.

09:47.643 --> 09:48.776
No, no, no.

09:48.778 --> 09:52.051
If we make it 365 days
without an injury,

09:52.053 --> 09:54.315
corporate gives us a cupcake party.

09:54.317 --> 09:57.251
They send us cupcakes
from a fancy bakery in a box

09:57.253 --> 09:59.353
with a card that says, "Good job."

09:59.355 --> 10:00.654
Sorry, guys.

10:00.656 --> 10:02.156
Maybe next year.

10:02.855 --> 10:04.425
And we were so close.

10:04.427 --> 10:05.793
They take your picture

10:05.795 --> 10:07.595
and put it in the corporate
newsletter and everything.

10:07.597 --> 10:08.963
I was hoping to use that picture

10:08.965 --> 10:11.199
for my Farmers Only dating profile.

10:11.546 --> 10:13.253
Nice going, Mike.

10:13.255 --> 10:15.303
Hey, there's more important
things in life

10:15.305 --> 10:17.004
than a cupcake party.

10:18.140 --> 10:20.039
And eventually, we'll think of one.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.745
Beautiful day for a drive.

10:25.747 --> 10:27.481
- Relaxing, ain't it?
- Uh-huh.

10:27.483 --> 10:29.849
You know, this seems like
it's turning into a whole thing,

10:29.851 --> 10:31.985
and I really should get back
for dinner and my life

10:31.987 --> 10:34.154
and to the people who know where I am.

10:34.156 --> 10:36.189
There's nothing like the open road.

10:36.191 --> 10:39.259
I just feel so trapped in
that fishbowl of a neighborhood,

10:39.261 --> 10:40.994
everybody always judging you.

10:40.996 --> 10:42.662
You know what neighbor
I <i> really</i> don't like?

10:42.664 --> 10:44.498
That Nancy Donahue.

10:44.500 --> 10:45.665
Oh.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.700
I don't know. She's nice.

10:47.702 --> 10:49.569
What don't you like about her?

10:49.571 --> 10:51.204
Well, she thinks she's all that,

10:51.206 --> 10:53.739
that her house is all that,
that her kids are all that.

10:53.741 --> 10:54.740
Like them girls,

10:54.742 --> 10:56.416
and that boy at that fancy college,

10:56.418 --> 10:58.144
and that weird one who reads.

10:58.146 --> 10:59.595
Uh, that one's mine.

10:59.597 --> 11:01.280
And she thinks she's better
than everybody else

11:01.282 --> 11:03.315
'cause her teenagers are potty-trained.

11:03.317 --> 11:05.251
That's what I like about me and you.

11:05.253 --> 11:06.952
We don't care about our yards.

11:06.954 --> 11:09.455
Well, I... I care a little.

11:09.457 --> 11:10.856
But... But... But I hear you.

11:10.858 --> 11:12.791
I mean, it's like,
people who make you jam.

11:12.793 --> 11:14.660
They don't want you to <i> have</i> jam.

11:14.662 --> 11:15.994
They want to show you they <i> made</i> jam.

11:15.996 --> 11:17.229
I know.

11:17.231 --> 11:19.798
It's like, what dark hole
are you fillin' in your life

11:19.800 --> 11:21.974
that you need to foist jam
on your neighbors?

11:23.638 --> 11:25.337
Exactly.

11:25.339 --> 11:27.939
<i>You know, maybe Rita was okay.</i>

11:27.941 --> 11:30.290
<i>Maybe we weren't so different after all.</i>

11:30.292 --> 11:32.978
<i>She might even be a little... fun.</i>

11:32.980 --> 11:34.813
<i>What was I worried about?</i>

11:35.816 --> 11:37.049
Aw, damn it.

11:37.051 --> 11:38.616
I'm out of range.

11:43.356 --> 11:46.624
Um, I-I-I don't think you're
supposed to be doing that.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.293
Oh, please. It happens all the time.

11:48.295 --> 11:50.662
If I didn't take this thing off,
I'd never go anywhere.

11:51.865 --> 11:55.834
Good luck findin' that one, Barney Fife!

12:00.372 --> 12:01.405
Hey, Dad.

12:01.407 --> 12:02.506
Hey.

12:02.508 --> 12:03.774
Where's Mom?

12:03.776 --> 12:04.775
I don't know.

12:04.777 --> 12:06.010
She sent a text

12:06.012 --> 12:08.779
about running some errand
with Rita Glossner.

12:08.781 --> 12:10.380
You know anything about baking cupcakes?

12:10.382 --> 12:11.949
I know Mom uses a box.

12:11.951 --> 12:13.283
Yeah, I got that.

12:13.285 --> 12:15.953
But where are the measuring cups
and mixing bowl?

12:15.955 --> 12:18.155
Measuring cups are in the junk drawer,

12:18.157 --> 12:20.457
and the mixing bowl is holding our mail.

12:20.459 --> 12:22.893
Aha!

12:23.963 --> 12:25.696
Oh, and I think you're supposed to have

12:25.698 --> 12:27.998
those little pink and green
papers that go around them.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.734
What do you mean, "Go around them"?

12:29.736 --> 12:31.368
You know, when you finish the cupcake,

12:31.370 --> 12:32.369
you eat the paper?

12:32.371 --> 12:33.670
Eh. Do we really need those?

12:33.672 --> 12:34.871
I don't know.

12:34.873 --> 12:36.405
If they don't have the paper,
they might be muffins.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.406
But if you need it,

12:37.408 --> 12:38.842
I've got some leftover graph paper.

12:38.844 --> 12:40.643
Okay. Paper's paper.

12:43.070 --> 12:44.901
Why are you making cupcakes, anyway?

12:44.903 --> 12:48.084
Well, the guys at work were
supposed to have a cupcake party

12:48.086 --> 12:50.987
for going 365 days
without a workrelated injury,

12:50.989 --> 12:53.857
but then somebody fell.

12:53.859 --> 12:54.858
Was it funny?

12:54.860 --> 12:56.893
No. It wasn't funny at all.

12:56.895 --> 12:58.795
Ah. It was you, wasn't it?

13:00.331 --> 13:02.325
Yes, fine. I fell at work.

13:02.350 --> 13:03.599
Congratulations. You cracked the case.

13:03.601 --> 13:04.768
You happy?

13:04.770 --> 13:06.702
That explains the cupcakes.
You hit your head.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.271
Now you're having a behavior change.

13:08.273 --> 13:09.272
Follow my finger.

13:09.274 --> 13:10.373
No. I'm fine.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.874
It's just, you know,

13:11.876 --> 13:14.543
not great that it happened at work.

13:14.958 --> 13:17.179
Oh, you're embarrassed.

13:17.512 --> 13:18.881
Did I say I'm embarrassed?

13:18.883 --> 13:20.182
I'm not embarrassed.

13:20.184 --> 13:23.286
All right, I'm just saying,
if you are, you shouldn't be.

13:23.288 --> 13:25.053
Trust me, you're in my wheelhouse now.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.922
The problem isn't you being embarrassed.

13:26.924 --> 13:29.191
The problem is you don't
embarrass yourself enough.

13:29.193 --> 13:30.861
I embarrass myself all the time.

13:30.863 --> 13:33.296
Like today,
I started eating a girl's hair.

13:33.298 --> 13:35.431
It was on her head and in my sandwich.

13:35.433 --> 13:36.565
But if you ask me

13:36.567 --> 13:37.966
what embarrassing thing
happened yesterday,

13:37.968 --> 13:39.368
I couldn't even tell you.

13:39.370 --> 13:40.569
I don't remember.

13:40.571 --> 13:42.316
It just becomes
part of the fabric of your life.

13:42.318 --> 13:44.071
Well, that's not gonna happen

13:44.073 --> 13:46.174
'cause I'm not gonna
embarrass myself again.

13:46.176 --> 13:47.975
Now, pass me those rainbow sprinkles.

13:47.977 --> 13:49.877
It says if you add those to the batter,

13:49.879 --> 13:51.379
you get a more festive look.

13:51.381 --> 13:53.080
I think the guys will enjoy that.

13:54.117 --> 13:56.618
Dad, if you're that worried
about being embarrassed...

13:56.620 --> 13:59.086
You work in a quarry, right?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.822
Is there a cave or something
you can go down to

14:00.824 --> 14:01.956
and have a good cry?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.392
Brick, it's not <i> that</i> bad.

14:04.394 --> 14:07.295
Well, if it's not bad enough
you need to go cry in a cave,

14:07.297 --> 14:08.830
what are you worried about?

14:13.865 --> 14:17.271
Oh, I think you're supposed to
preheat the oven to 375.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.739
Got it. Did it.

14:18.741 --> 14:20.107
Way ahead of you.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.976
Quilt!

14:29.194 --> 14:30.484
You stay here and watch the bag.

14:30.486 --> 14:31.485
I'll get snacks.

14:31.487 --> 14:32.920
You got a jerky preference?

14:32.922 --> 14:35.656
Okay, look, this is already
taking longer than I thought,

14:35.658 --> 14:37.624
and I really need to get back to my...

14:37.626 --> 14:38.861
Beef!

14:43.699 --> 14:45.099
Officers?

14:45.101 --> 14:46.968
Excuse me, hi.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.135
Sorry to bother you.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.470
Can I ask you a quick question?

14:49.472 --> 14:50.504
Yes, ma'am.

14:50.506 --> 14:53.474
So, you probably get this a lot, but...

14:53.476 --> 14:54.575
"accomplice."

14:54.577 --> 14:56.810
What does that really mean?

14:56.812 --> 14:59.380
Is it like when you're
planning something with someone

14:59.382 --> 15:01.382
or more along for the ride, so to speak?

15:01.384 --> 15:02.983
- Is something the matter?
- N-No.

15:02.985 --> 15:04.251
No, no, no.

15:04.253 --> 15:06.420
It's just something I was
wondering about, you know?

15:06.422 --> 15:09.590
Just saw you here and thought,
"Hey, why not ask the experts?"

15:09.592 --> 15:10.758
Oh!

15:10.760 --> 15:12.325
Here's another one...
aiding and abetting.

15:12.327 --> 15:14.160
Is that the same thing or different?

15:14.162 --> 15:15.729
Can you aid without abetting?

15:15.731 --> 15:17.831
And can someone force you
to aid and abet?

15:17.833 --> 15:19.600
Are you in some sort of trouble?

15:19.602 --> 15:21.301
Uh, no, I... I don't think so.

15:21.303 --> 15:23.270
Because if you'd be more comfortable

15:23.272 --> 15:24.505
talking at the station, we could...

15:24.507 --> 15:26.072
No, no, no, no.

15:26.074 --> 15:27.274
Gosh, no.

15:27.276 --> 15:28.908
These are just some
of the things I think about.

15:28.910 --> 15:30.510
You know, some people scrapbook.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.679
I think about criminal intent
and jurisprudence, so...

15:34.916 --> 15:37.450
Oh, hey, there's my friend,
Rita Glossner,

15:37.452 --> 15:40.620
who lives at
418 Birchwood Avenue in Orson.

15:40.622 --> 15:42.221
Just in case. Bye!

15:45.192 --> 15:47.359
Seriously, do you see any bald spots?

15:47.361 --> 15:49.261
I think she took out a chunk of my hair.

15:49.263 --> 15:50.296
Not cool!

15:50.298 --> 15:52.097
She wants everything to be like it was.

15:52.099 --> 15:53.733
Well, guess what... I'm not doing that.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.067
They insulted something I love.

15:55.069 --> 15:56.402
That's so mean.

15:56.404 --> 15:58.170
What did they insult?

15:58.172 --> 15:59.271
Oh, uh...

15:59.273 --> 16:00.472
corn dogs.

16:00.474 --> 16:02.040
They hate them.

16:02.042 --> 16:03.842
Anyway, they can't tell me
how to run my life.

16:03.844 --> 16:05.376
I'm an adult man now.

16:05.378 --> 16:07.345
That tickles.

16:07.347 --> 16:09.748
I think I get what you mean.
My family hates you.

16:09.750 --> 16:11.215
What?

16:11.217 --> 16:13.452
Yeah, they think
I could do a lot better.

16:13.454 --> 16:14.586
A lot?

16:14.588 --> 16:16.588
I mean, you're great...
don't get me wrong.

16:16.590 --> 16:17.956
And you deserve somebody great,

16:17.958 --> 16:19.458
but I thought that somebody was me.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.493
They really liked Doug Dixon.

16:21.495 --> 16:22.694
He had a pontoon.

16:22.696 --> 16:24.228
Doug Dixo... See, this is what I mean.

16:24.230 --> 16:26.097
Our families think they know
what's best for us,

16:26.099 --> 16:27.432
but they don't know.

16:27.434 --> 16:29.568
<i>We</i> know! Even Grandma Tee-Tee?

16:29.570 --> 16:31.703
Oh, especially Grandma Tee-Tee.

16:31.885 --> 16:32.883
You know what?

16:32.885 --> 16:35.052
Who cares what anybody else thinks?

16:35.054 --> 16:36.787
We know our love is real.

16:36.789 --> 16:39.123
We don't need people telling us
how to live our lives.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.324
Yeah!

16:40.326 --> 16:42.260
The important thing
is that we have each other.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.762
And your family loves me.

16:44.764 --> 16:48.166
A-A-A-nd we have each other.

16:55.266 --> 16:57.308
Oh, boy.

16:57.310 --> 16:58.490
How long have I been asleep?

16:58.697 --> 17:00.230
About three states.

17:00.232 --> 17:01.231
What?

17:01.233 --> 17:03.633
I only closed my eyes for a second!

17:03.635 --> 17:05.701
Okay, that's it, Rita.
I demand an answer.

17:05.703 --> 17:07.036
Where are you taking me?

17:07.038 --> 17:08.404
Already took you.

17:08.406 --> 17:09.805
We're in Georgia.

17:15.066 --> 17:19.723
<i>After 537 terrifying miles,
I finally realized</i>

17:19.748 --> 17:21.981
<i>maybe I should've just
handed Rita my car keys</i>

17:21.983 --> 17:22.982
<i>in the first place.</i>

17:22.983 --> 17:24.183
We're here.

17:25.721 --> 17:30.357
Look, Rita, whatever it is,
don't make me go in.

17:30.359 --> 17:32.024
I have not seen anything
or heard anything.

17:32.026 --> 17:33.360
I won't tell anybody.

17:33.362 --> 17:35.662
I am not aiding, nor am I abetting.

17:35.664 --> 17:37.264
What the hell are you talkin' about?

17:37.266 --> 17:38.732
You get weird when you're tired.

17:38.734 --> 17:39.866
Let's go. Grab the bag.

17:39.868 --> 17:41.233
You told me not to touch the bag.

17:41.235 --> 17:42.601
Bring the damn bag, woman.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.770
If things here go smoothly,
we'll get you home.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.672
I've waited a long time for this moment.

17:46.674 --> 17:47.873
Don't spoil it.

17:49.710 --> 17:52.010
Listen, my guys work hard all year long

17:52.012 --> 17:55.046
and cupcakes are important
to them, and rightfully so.

17:55.048 --> 17:57.516
Take it from me,
they're not easy to make.

17:57.518 --> 17:59.251
Those little papers are important.

17:59.253 --> 18:01.219
You want to get those
at a cupcake store.

18:01.221 --> 18:03.355
Mike, we appreciate you
calling us down here

18:03.357 --> 18:04.690
and pleading your case,

18:04.692 --> 18:07.259
and your devotion to your
employees is admirable, but...

18:07.261 --> 18:09.060
cupcake parties have to be earned.

18:09.062 --> 18:10.429
Exactly.

18:10.431 --> 18:12.331
I mean, if we just started
handing out cupcake parties

18:12.333 --> 18:13.965
Willy-nilly, they'd lose their meaning.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.033
All right.

18:15.035 --> 18:17.335
I didn't want to have to do this, but...

18:17.337 --> 18:19.870
<i>So Mike realized
if Brick could get through</i>

18:19.872 --> 18:22.139
<i>all those embarrassments and be fine,</i>

18:22.141 --> 18:25.276
<i>he certainly could get through one.</i>

18:28.080 --> 18:29.013
Ohh! Ohh!

18:29.982 --> 18:31.081
Yeah...

18:31.083 --> 18:33.851
Yeah, I know, it's funny.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.522
Okay.

18:37.524 --> 18:40.458
If you'll notice,
the time stamp says 5:03 p.m.

18:40.460 --> 18:43.528
Our work day ends at 5:00,
so, technically,

18:43.530 --> 18:47.432
the fall happened after we'd
already made it to 365 days.

18:47.434 --> 18:49.667
I'm not trying to play hardball
with you guys.

18:49.669 --> 18:52.870
I'm just saying, my men
deserve their cupcake party.

18:54.240 --> 18:56.006
Looks like you're right.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.453
You obviously care about your guys.

18:59.455 --> 19:02.112
Because if you're willing
to show that tape...

19:02.114 --> 19:04.081
I'm sorry.

19:04.083 --> 19:05.615
Can... Can we watch it again?

19:05.617 --> 19:07.584
It's not <i> that</i> funny.

19:19.198 --> 19:24.134
Say hey to my grandbaby,
Vernon James Glossner.

19:24.136 --> 19:25.568
He was born three days ago,

19:25.570 --> 19:27.871
and I just had to find a way
to come and see him.

19:29.274 --> 19:31.975
Mrs. Heck, thanks for bringing
Mom all the way down here.

19:31.977 --> 19:34.410
It's my pleasure.

19:34.412 --> 19:37.347
And look at you, Rodney, all grown up.

19:37.349 --> 19:39.048
Yeah, I know I caused a lot
of trouble when I was a kid,

19:39.050 --> 19:40.383
but I got my life together now,

19:40.385 --> 19:43.709
with my fiancée and... and Little Vern.

19:43.711 --> 19:46.655
Even got a job waiting for me
at the Lumber Liquidators,

19:46.657 --> 19:48.858
just as soon as I get this off.

19:48.860 --> 19:51.831
Oh. Well, congratulations.

19:51.833 --> 19:54.964
Hey, Frankie, open up
that bag there, and be gentle.

19:58.503 --> 20:00.102
Oh.

20:00.104 --> 20:03.338
"Baby's First Christmas" ornament.

20:03.340 --> 20:04.673
It's got a little boy angel on it.

20:04.675 --> 20:06.241
Just like I got right here.

20:06.243 --> 20:08.511
I ordered it special
to get it person-ized.

20:08.513 --> 20:11.046
They don't make any
with "Vernon" already on 'em.

20:11.814 --> 20:14.683
<i>Seeing that baby in Rita's arms
made me realize</i>

20:14.685 --> 20:17.052
<i>moments go by so fast.</i>

20:17.054 --> 20:20.088
<i>It hadn't been that long
since Axl was a baby.</i>

20:20.090 --> 20:23.091
<i>That's when I knew I had to
make things right with Axl.</i>

20:23.093 --> 20:26.361
<i>There was nothing he could say
or do that would upset me now.</i>

20:26.363 --> 20:27.996
Sue, I need to talk to you right now!

20:27.998 --> 20:30.232
I did something stupid!
I did something really stupid!

20:30.234 --> 20:31.500
W-W-What? What is it?

20:32.703 --> 20:34.903
I married April!

20:44.255 --> 20:46.222
Safety, safety! One at a time!

20:46.224 --> 20:47.656
I got a red velvet.

20:47.658 --> 20:49.058
I got a red velvet!

20:49.060 --> 20:53.061
And look, a note... "Good job, guys."

20:53.063 --> 20:55.134
You know, we're not just
sharing cupcakes right now.

20:55.136 --> 20:56.392
We're sharing love.

20:56.394 --> 20:58.667
And this man right here's a love-maker.

20:58.669 --> 20:59.935
I've never been happier

20:59.937 --> 21:01.799
that I left my job
driving that school bus

21:01.801 --> 21:04.640
to spend my days here
in a hole with you people.

21:04.642 --> 21:06.174
Thanks, boss man.

21:06.176 --> 21:07.309
To Mike! To Mike! To Mike! To Mike!

21:07.311 --> 21:08.310
Mike!

21:08.312 --> 21:09.411
Hey, I know.

21:09.413 --> 21:11.279
Let's all talk about
our favorite Mike moment.

21:11.281 --> 21:12.140
Mine is...

21:12.142 --> 21:13.151
All right, all right.

21:13.153 --> 21:14.374
Everybody back to work.
