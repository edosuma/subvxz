[Mulder's Voice]
They said the birds refused to sing...

00:10.910 --> 00:13.606
and the thermometer
fell suddenly,

00:13.680 --> 00:16.706
as if God himself
had his breath stolen away.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.224
No one there dared
speak aloud,

00:25.291 --> 00:27.885
as much in shame
as in sorrow.

00:27.961 --> 00:31.260
They uncovered the bodies
one by one.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.765
The eyes of the dead
were closed,

00:33.833 --> 00:36.199
as if waiting for permission
to open them.

00:38.204 --> 00:41.503
Were they still dreaming
of ice cream and monkey bars,

00:41.574 --> 00:45.476
of birthday cake and
no future but the afternoon?

00:45.545 --> 00:49.106
Or had their innocence been
taken along with their lives,

00:49.182 --> 00:52.379
buried in the cold earth
so long ago?

00:54.954 --> 00:58.446
These fates seemed too cruel,
even for God to allow.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.860
Or are the tragic young born again
when the world's not looking?

01:06.666 --> 01:10.830
I wanna believe so badly
in a truth beyond our own,

01:10.904 --> 01:14.670
hidden and obscured from all
but the most sensitive eyes.

In the endless procession

01:28.788 --> 01:31.780
in what cannot and
will not be destroyed,

01:36.663 --> 01:41.032
I want to believe we are unaware of
God's eternal recompense and sadness...

01:42.102 --> 01:45.265
that we cannot see his truth.

01:47.640 --> 01:52.373
That that which is born still lives

[Door Opens]

03:23.768 --> 03:26.999
Ed Truelove was 19 when
he committed his first murder.

03:27.072 --> 03:30.098
He was working as a janitor
at an elementary school...

03:30.175 --> 03:33.303
and they needed someone
to play Santa Claus.

03:33.378 --> 03:35.903
He never got over
the feelings it aroused.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.448
He's admitted to
all of it, Mulder...

03:38.516 --> 03:40.780
24 separate murders.

03:43.288 --> 03:47.691
But he refuses to take blame
for Amber Lynn LaPierre.

03:49.194 --> 03:52.994
I was just handed the
preliminary forensics report.

03:54.766 --> 03:57.394
Her body was not one of
those found in the graves.

04:00.171 --> 04:03.140
Mulder, I know you wanted
to find her out there.

04:03.208 --> 04:06.371
He's got hours of video
of her.

04:06.444 --> 04:08.605
I'm talking about your sister.

04:13.785 --> 04:17.653
- I know that's who you're looking for.
- Yeah.

04:17.721 --> 04:21.817
You don't know how badly I wanted her
to be in one of those graves.

04:21.892 --> 04:26.125
Hard as it is to admit, I wanted
to find her here riding her bike
like all these other kids.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.668
I guess I just want it
to be over.

04:33.371 --> 04:36.397
- [Door Opens]
- [Man] Agent Mulder, Scully.

04:36.474 --> 04:38.965
There's a Mr. Harold Piller
here to see you.

04:52.824 --> 04:56.658
- Mr. Piller?
- Agent Mulder.

04:56.728 --> 04:59.094
- Agent Scully.
- Do we know each other?

04:59.164 --> 05:02.327
Not personally, no. But I'm happy
to meet you. Hi. Harold Piller.

05:02.400 --> 05:05.028
Mr. Piller, are you part
of this investigation?

05:05.103 --> 05:07.367
Yes, I hope to be.

05:07.438 --> 05:11.135
- How can we help you?
- I was hoping to help you.

05:13.211 --> 05:15.338
You're a police psychic.

05:15.413 --> 05:17.347
My references are on the back.

05:18.950 --> 05:21.817
I've gotten some strong
hits off this case.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.116
You're looking for
a little girl,

05:24.189 --> 05:27.022
but she's not among
the dead.

05:27.091 --> 05:29.491
Your suspect is going
to say he didn't kill her.

05:29.561 --> 05:31.461
Did he?

05:31.529 --> 05:35.021
No. I think I can help find her.

05:35.099 --> 05:38.466
Mr. Piller, you have
some interesting references here.

05:38.536 --> 05:42.404
You've worked with law enforcements
in Kashmir, India, Myanmar,

05:42.473 --> 05:44.737
Afghanistan, Pakistan,
Khyber Pass.

05:44.809 --> 05:47.744
That was a train wreck...
a horrible tragedy.

05:47.812 --> 05:51.578
They called me in to locate the bodies
of seven children who were unrecovered.

05:51.649 --> 05:54.675
- And did you recover them?
- I didn't recover them, no.

05:54.752 --> 05:57.687
- But I explained what happened.
- What happened?

05:57.755 --> 06:02.158
The children's bodies were transported
from the accident site...

06:02.227 --> 06:06.027
by a spiritual intervention,
what are known as walk-ins.

06:06.097 --> 06:09.191
Thank you, Mr. Piller,
but we have real work to be done.

06:11.502 --> 06:14.994
I've studied this phenomenon
the world over...

06:15.073 --> 06:19.271
at mud slides in Peru,
earthquakes in Uzbekistan.

06:19.344 --> 06:22.507
Kids' bodies never found,
never accounted for in any other way.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.946
What happened to them?

06:25.016 --> 06:28.076
The bodies were transported
from the various sites...

06:28.152 --> 06:30.086
in starlight.

06:31.489 --> 06:34.458
Please excuse us. Mulder?

06:35.860 --> 06:39.557
- Mulder, please.
- What is it?

06:39.631 --> 06:42.498
Mulder, you have been through
so much in such a short time...

06:42.567 --> 06:45.968
the death of your mother
and the feelings it's
brought up for your sister.

06:46.037 --> 06:48.403
You're vulnerable right now.

06:48.473 --> 06:52.239
We still have a missing body...
Amber Lynn LaPierre.
She may be alive. We don't know.

06:52.310 --> 06:55.609
But this man isn't gonna
help us find her, by his own admission.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.911
It's not the first time
I've heard what he's saying...

06:58.983 --> 07:01.645
about the intervention
of these walking spirits.

07:01.719 --> 07:04.745
Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned
it to me in the prison.

07:04.822 --> 07:08.189
- She said that's who took her son.
- Because it's foolproof, Mulder.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.989
Nobody is gonna disprove it
if there's no body.

07:11.062 --> 07:12.996
And that's exactly
what this man does.

07:13.064 --> 07:15.794
He gives a comforting
explanation at a train wreck...

07:15.867 --> 07:17.835
or an earthquake
that everyone can live with.

07:17.902 --> 07:20.735
But the fact is
the bodies are still buried.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.739
Or maybe they are
somewhere else.

07:24.976 --> 07:27.103
Like your sister?

07:27.178 --> 07:29.408
Mulder,

07:29.480 --> 07:32.938
you told me that all you wanted
was for this to be over.

07:33.017 --> 07:35.008
I do.

07:35.086 --> 07:37.384
I do.

07:37.455 --> 07:40.913
Well, then I'm going
back to Washington.

07:40.992 --> 07:43.927
There's nothing more
to be done here.

08:00.211 --> 08:02.406
How long have you
been doing this?

08:02.480 --> 08:04.880
A few years.

08:06.718 --> 08:11.052
I have a son who disappeared
under strange circumstances.

08:13.124 --> 08:15.786
He's never been found.

08:15.860 --> 08:20.627
And then one day, I just...
started to see them.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.897
These walk-ins,
you say they...

08:24.969 --> 08:27.733
they come and take
the children.

08:27.805 --> 08:30.330
- Why?
- In almost every case,

08:30.408 --> 08:33.673
the parents had
a precognitive image...

08:33.745 --> 08:35.770
of their child dead.

08:37.115 --> 08:39.674
Horrible visions.

08:39.751 --> 08:44.745
I believe what this is
is the work of good spirits...

08:45.890 --> 08:48.120
foretelling their fates.

08:48.192 --> 08:50.922
A fate the child
was about to meet,

08:50.995 --> 08:55.022
a particularly violent fate
that wasn't meant to be.

08:55.099 --> 08:58.000
Which is why
the spirits intervened,

08:58.069 --> 09:00.663
transforming matter
into pure energy.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.370
Starlight.

09:06.978 --> 09:09.538
But it's not
what happened here.

09:09.614 --> 09:11.741
How do you know that?

09:11.816 --> 09:15.513
Because these children
all died suffering,

09:15.586 --> 09:19.113
pleading innocently
for their lives.

09:22.260 --> 09:26.356
These beautiful children,
so... trusting and pure.

09:27.765 --> 09:29.824
I see them.

09:29.901 --> 09:32.870
My God, why?

09:32.937 --> 09:35.531
Why must some suffer
and not others?

09:37.975 --> 09:40.910
You see them?
Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?

09:42.980 --> 09:45.574
She wasn't here.
She never was.

09:46.884 --> 09:50.684
But I'm... I'm sensing
a connection with her...

09:51.756 --> 09:53.690
to this place.

09:55.526 --> 09:58.394
No, it's a connection to...

10:00.896 --> 10:03.729
- It's a connection to you.
- How's that?

10:10.873 --> 10:13.433
You lost someone
close to you.

10:13.509 --> 10:16.034
Ayoung girl.

10:16.111 --> 10:20.172
It happened a...
a long time ago.

10:22.751 --> 10:24.412
Your sister.

10:26.822 --> 10:30.918
There's a connection
between these girls, isn't there?

10:30.993 --> 10:32.927
Between her and Amber Lynn?

10:35.764 --> 10:37.698
What is the connection?

10:39.334 --> 10:42.098
I don't know.

10:42.171 --> 10:46.505
But we're going to find them.
I'm sure of it.

10:48.277 --> 10:50.973
[Man]
I'm going to count backwards now, Fox.

10:51.046 --> 10:53.412
And you'll fall into
a deep relaxed state...

10:53.482 --> 10:56.974
so that you'll remember all about
your sister and what happened.

11:06.195 --> 11:08.129

11:10.132 --> 11:12.191
Where are you now, Fox?

11:12.267 --> 11:15.031
I'm at home...

11:16.371 --> 11:19.534
We're in the den
playing a game.

11:19.608 --> 11:21.701
Who are you there with?

11:21.777 --> 11:23.802
Samantha.

11:23.879 --> 11:26.245
- Do you feel in any danger?
- No.

11:26.315 --> 11:30.445
We're arguing, you know, but not really.
Just playing the game.
You know, fooling around.

11:30.519 --> 11:35.183
By what I can tell from
the tape, he seems to be
in a legitimate hypnotic state.

11:35.257 --> 11:38.749
Pieces on the board
are fallin' off...

11:38.827 --> 11:41.159
[Man]
Here I became suspicious.

11:41.230 --> 11:44.290
- [Mulder] Samantha?
- Suspicious of what?

11:46.502 --> 11:50.438
In 30 years with the F.B.I.,
you think you've seen it all.

11:52.107 --> 11:54.098
I sometimes think I have.

11:54.176 --> 11:59.204
But this is just a garden variety
compensatory abduction fantasy.

11:59.281 --> 12:01.272
Compensatory for what?

12:02.484 --> 12:05.476
His guilt. His fear.

12:05.554 --> 12:07.488
Everything that's preventing
Agent Mulder...

12:07.556 --> 12:10.184
from remembering the truth about
what really happened that night.

12:10.259 --> 12:12.921
You mean his sister
wasn't abducted?

12:12.995 --> 12:17.227
No, his sister definitely went missing
in 1973. That's not in dispute.

12:17.299 --> 12:23.067
Agent Mulder, however,
wasn't regressed until 1989.

12:23.138 --> 12:26.403
See, his delusion is playing
into his unconscious hope...

12:26.475 --> 12:28.739
that his sister
is still alive.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.779
And if you think about it,
his delusion has the effect...

12:31.847 --> 12:33.781
of giving him reason
to pursue her.

12:33.849 --> 12:36.943
But why alien abduction?

12:37.019 --> 12:39.579
Close Encounters, E. T.,
who knows?

12:39.655 --> 12:43.523
But there was probably a lot of imagery
collecting in his head...

12:43.592 --> 12:45.526
in those 16 years.

12:45.594 --> 12:49.086
And then he comes down here,
and he finds the X-Files.

12:49.164 --> 12:51.724
So what do you think
happened to his sister?

12:53.468 --> 12:55.402
Well, in 1973...

12:55.470 --> 13:00.203
we were pretty damned unsophisticated
about violent predatory crime.

13:00.275 --> 13:03.506
My guess is she was
kidnapped in the house,

13:03.579 --> 13:05.843
her body was disposed of,
never found.

13:05.914 --> 13:07.905
You think that
his sister's dead?

13:07.983 --> 13:11.350
Have you seen this file?

13:11.420 --> 13:16.187
There was an extraordinary amount
of effort put into fnding his sister.

13:16.258 --> 13:18.920
Even the treasury department
got involved.

13:18.994 --> 13:21.656
His father worked at a high level
in the government.

13:21.730 --> 13:24.426
They found nothing.

13:24.499 --> 13:28.936
Why, Agent Scully? Why do you
wanna bring all this back up now?

13:30.372 --> 13:32.306
Someone owes it to Mulder.

13:32.374 --> 13:35.309
Word of advice,
me to you.

13:35.377 --> 13:38.039
Let it be.

13:38.113 --> 13:42.106
You know, there are some wounds that are
just too painful ever to be reopened.

13:42.184 --> 13:44.948
Well, this particular wound
has never healed.

13:46.355 --> 13:49.119
And Mulder deserves closure,
just like anyone.

I found something, and I'm standing here
not quite believing what it is.

- What is it?
- I don't know if you know this,

17:39.286 --> 17:43.552
but there was a special treasury
department investigation
into Samantha's disappearance.

17:43.623 --> 17:45.921
In 1973.
I know all about that.

17:45.992 --> 17:50.429
Well, I'm in your mother's house
and I found a piece of a document
that she burned.

17:50.497 --> 17:55.935
A document that matches one that I found
in the treasury investigation file.

effectively calls off the search
for your sister, Mulder.

He was involved with this

That's not exactly a revelation,

he's the man that killed your father,

done nothing but confound your work,

18:28.301 --> 18:30.235

to killing you.

And here he's ordering people
to stop looking for your sister.

it's gonna help me find her now.

are on that document.

21:12.665 --> 21:14.599

no one's gonna find her.

- Because I believe she's dead.

why didn't you say something
earlier? Why now?

There was so much to protect before.
It's all gone now.

21:34.587 --> 21:37.647
So you just let Mulder believe
that she was alive for all these years?

21:37.723 --> 21:40.089
Out of kindness,
Agent Scully.

21:41.160 --> 21:43.128

You didn't say with who.

24:02.433 --> 24:05.834
When did you come up
with this story, Mulder?

24:05.903 --> 24:09.395
Because yesterday when
I spoke to you, you said
that the Smoking Man wasn't involved.

He had every reason
to call off the hunt for my sister.

she was returned to him...

along with his son Jeffrey Spender.

37:17.724 --> 37:20.784
at the Dominic Savio
Memorial Hospital in 1979?

37:20.861 --> 37:23.295
Yes, I'm she.

37:24.565 --> 37:27.693
I'd like to ask you about
a patient you treated...

37:27.768 --> 37:29.929
a 14-year-old girl.

37:31.805 --> 37:35.036
[Arbutus]
I remember. Yes.

37:35.108 --> 37:37.372
She was such
a pretty young girl.

37:37.444 --> 37:41.574
You couldn't forget someone like her,
or how frightened she was.

37:41.648 --> 37:44.674
Scared for her sweet life.

37:44.751 --> 37:48.380
The deputy brought her in.
She was shaking like a leaf.

37:48.455 --> 37:51.856
Wouldn't let anyone
touch her but me.

37:51.925 --> 37:55.292
Then the strangest thing happened.

37:55.362 --> 37:58.297
You had a vision
of her... dead.

37:58.365 --> 38:01.232
Like the parents
of Amber Lynn LaPierre.

38:01.301 --> 38:03.326
No one believed me.

38:05.072 --> 38:08.166
Honestly, you're
the first person who...

38:08.242 --> 38:10.870
- So you saw her dead?
- That night in her bed.

38:10.944 --> 38:13.845
I blinked and it was gone.

38:13.914 --> 38:16.075
She was sleeping
as sound as could be.

38:17.451 --> 38:19.385
I don't know why, but...

38:19.453 --> 38:23.412
it made some kind
of strange sense.

38:23.490 --> 38:25.651
What do you mean?

38:25.726 --> 38:27.751
There were men.

38:27.828 --> 38:30.558
They came to pick her up
late that night.

38:30.631 --> 38:33.930
I assumed the one
was her father, but he...

38:34.001 --> 38:36.993
he gave me such a chill
when he looked at me...

38:37.070 --> 38:40.233
when I asked him would he please
put out his cigarette.

38:43.110 --> 38:45.411
So, they took her?

38:45.544 --> 38:47.068
They meant to.

38:47.146 --> 38:49.842
But when I took them
to her room,

38:49.915 --> 38:51.849
she was gone.

38:51.917 --> 38:55.683
Disappeared out of a locked room.

38:55.754 --> 38:57.915
Just vanished.

39:17.810 --> 39:20.745
##[Soft, Ethereal]

40:01.987 --> 40:04.922
##[Continues]

40:50.469 --> 40:52.403
Samantha.

41:46.858 --> 41:49.383
Mulder, where'd you go?

41:52.798 --> 41:54.732
End of the road.

42:00.339 --> 42:02.307
He's okay.
It's okay.

42:02.374 --> 42:04.467
My son?
You saw my son?

42:04.543 --> 42:08.411
He's dead.
They're all dead, Harold...

42:10.482 --> 42:13.110
your son, Amber Lynn,
my sister.

42:13.185 --> 42:15.380
- No.
- Harold.

42:15.454 --> 42:19.117
You see so much,
but you refuse to see him.

42:20.192 --> 42:22.922
You refuse to let him go.

42:22.995 --> 42:25.463
But you have to let him
go now, Harold.

42:25.530 --> 42:28.499
He's protected. He's in a better place.
They're all in a better place.

42:28.567 --> 42:30.797
We both have to let go, Harold.

42:30.869 --> 42:33.804
You're wrong.
I'm going to find him.

42:33.872 --> 42:36.966
[Panting]
I don't believe you!

42:49.388 --> 42:51.322
Mulder, what happened?

42:53.091 --> 42:55.685
Are you sure
you're all right?

42:59.064 --> 43:00.998
I'm fine.

43:03.268 --> 43:05.202
I'm free.

43:46.475 --> 43:48.409
[Child]
I made this!

43:49.305 --> 43:55.595
