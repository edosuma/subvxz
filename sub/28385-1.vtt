Greetings, my brothers.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.388
I am Wang Chao.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.823
Your new employer Lao Ting...

01:41.360 --> 01:42.679
welcomes you to San Francisco.

01:43.200 --> 01:46.021
Lao Ting works hand-in-hand
with the Americans...

01:50.160 --> 01:52.663
Work hard, follow the laws...

01:53.080 --> 01:55.389
and you'll go home rich men.

01:58.120 --> 02:02.068
Present your papers to the
immigration officers for inspection.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.822
Since Lao Ting
has paid for your trip...

02:06.480 --> 02:08.698
your first four months' work
go to pay your debt.

02:09.240 --> 02:10.502
Then after that...

02:13.080 --> 02:14.217
you will start to earn your fortunes.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.942
What the hell are you doing?

02:45.680 --> 02:46.863
I'm hungry-

02:47.960 --> 02:48.949
Leave it.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.307
Come on.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.226
I said leave it.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.742
Where are you taking me?

06:32.640 --> 06:34.858
I'm doing you a favor.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.827
Keep your mouth shut,
and I'll take care of you.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.019
I had an American grandfather.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.060
It would be good to keep that
to yourself, you get me?

07:19.000 --> 07:22.697
Hey, Chao. How the fuck are you?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.820
What's with this fucking onion?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.900
This is no ordinary onion.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.027
Trust me, he's got serious skills.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.938
Help, they're killing us. Help me...

35:26.800 --> 35:28.825
It's probably the cobblestones.
