00:03.404 --> 00:05.806

-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

We need your help,
even if we don't trust you.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.361
In preparation for landing,

00:27.395 --> 00:30.064
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.166
Please return your tray table
and seat back

00:32.200 --> 00:35.103
to its full upright
and locked position.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.173
Can I put your bag up?

00:39.207 --> 00:41.375
-GIRL: Yeah.
-Okay.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.876
I like your monkey.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.513
RICHARD: Babe, babe?
Can I get another 7 and 7?

00:45.546 --> 00:48.716
-Uh, we're landing. You need
to put your laptop away. -Babe.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.384
And don't call me "babe."

00:52.953 --> 00:54.788
RICHARD:
Come on, it was a joke.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.624
-JANE: Well, apologize.
-Thank you.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.728
Hey, on behalf of all men,
I'd like to apologize as well.

01:00.761 --> 01:04.232
-Seat back all the way up.
-Yeah.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.267
Does it count if we're
not actually a mile high?

01:06.300 --> 01:08.302
Yes, it counts. Now flight
attendants will be too busy

01:08.336 --> 01:11.772
getting everything ready
to notice. Come on.

01:15.443 --> 01:18.779
TAMMY:
How about... movie and dinner?

01:18.812 --> 01:20.781
JAKE:
That feels too serious.

01:20.814 --> 01:23.651
Oh. Then how about
a movie and donuts?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.553
He's going on his first date.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.755
Wow! Major.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.390
Pick a card, any card.

01:29.423 --> 01:33.527
I didn't know
we had a magician on board.

01:36.029 --> 01:38.799
Is it the jack of spades?

01:38.832 --> 01:41.101
Yes! How did you do that?

01:55.716 --> 01:58.852
Control column not responding.

01:58.886 --> 02:01.189
Hydraulics are knocked out.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.361
Seat belts are on tight?

02:10.831 --> 02:12.032
-Mayday, Mayday.

02:12.065 --> 02:16.003
LB 46 is declaring an emergency.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.005
Brace yourselves
for emergency landing!

02:30.484 --> 02:32.119
Really?

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
If you want some, just ask.

02:34.188 --> 02:37.157
I'm good. I already ate.

02:37.191 --> 02:38.826
You still owe me 20 bucks, Buck.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.161
-Don't think I'm-a forget.

02:41.195 --> 02:43.664
For the damn cookie bouquet,
that I delivered to Chimney.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.065
The one with the get well card

02:45.098 --> 02:47.201
that I personally
watched you sign.

02:47.235 --> 02:49.537
BUCK:
He's doing it again.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.872
What

02:51.905 --> 02:54.174
Staring into that book.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.744
Come on, you must have a line
on the gossip around here.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.679
What is it? Why-why is he
so obsessed with it?

02:58.712 --> 03:01.682
HEN: Mm-mm. All I'm gonna
tell you about that book

03:01.715 --> 03:03.551
is to stay the hell away
from it.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.588
Trust me.

03:09.457 --> 03:13.761
I made that mistake
three months into working here.

03:13.794 --> 03:17.531
So you're saying no one here
knows what he writes in it.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.334
Well, watch this.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.736
All right, Buck. When he pops
you in that pretty face,

03:22.770 --> 03:25.306
just make sure it's on the side
that's already got a mark.

03:33.747 --> 03:36.049
So, Bobby, I got to ask.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.619
What's the deal with that book?

03:40.888 --> 03:43.357
It's none of your business.

03:43.391 --> 03:46.360
I know it's a list
of people you saved, all right?

03:46.394 --> 03:48.362
Right now,
there are 46 names in it.

03:48.396 --> 03:50.598
But there's space for 148.
Why that number?

03:50.631 --> 03:51.865
You read my book?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.635
I mean,
I-I peeked once or twi...

03:57.104 --> 03:59.239
Don't ever do that again.

04:33.841 --> 04:36.344
You guys ever seen something
like this before?

04:43.651 --> 04:46.620

04:57.164 --> 04:58.966
Captain Nash.
Who's got incident command?

04:58.999 --> 05:01.802
WALLY: You do now, Captain.
It looks like the plane split

05:01.835 --> 05:04.137
-in two on impact. -BOBBY:
All right, I'm gonna need you

05:04.171 --> 05:05.639
to be my point man on the beach.
All right, Hen,

05:05.673 --> 05:07.475
I need you to check
on the Coast Guard chopper.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.209
And, Buck, I need you to check
with the dive team, all right?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.545
-BUCK: We got at least 20.
-Hey, Buck.

05:11.579 --> 05:12.880
Just keep moving, Buck.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.383

05:37.037 --> 05:38.672
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

05:38.706 --> 05:41.375
MICHAEL : I've been
trying to get ahold of you.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.344
You would not believe the house
this girl lives in, Michael.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.146
You know she's having
a house party.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.816
4:00 on a school day.
House party.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.251
MICHAEL: What are you even
doing there, Athena?

05:51.284 --> 05:53.821
This will not convince
Social Services

05:53.854 --> 05:55.188
to let May come home.

05:55.222 --> 05:56.524
You're out of your mind.

05:56.557 --> 05:59.527
No. I'm a police officer
doing my job.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.595
You telling me
you don't want to see the look

06:01.629 --> 06:03.864
on this bitch's face
when I stroll in?

06:03.897 --> 06:06.834
After what she's put
our daughter through?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.769
You read those messages.

06:08.802 --> 06:13.340
I failed her once.
I won't do it again.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.444
("Finesse" by Bruno Mars
and Cardi B playing)

06:16.477 --> 06:17.845

06:26.086 --> 06:27.421
Who invited the troll?

GEORGINA:
Mona's okay. Her dad owns, like,

06:29.389 --> 06:31.124
a Mercedes dealership
in Torrance.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.293
You idiot. Everybody knows
Mona the Mastiff

06:33.326 --> 06:34.895
tried to hook up with Ricky.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.798
I thought you didn't like Ricky.
I can kick her out.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.400
No. Let her stay.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.603
We'll drag her ass later.

06:42.636 --> 06:45.038
I haven't slapped anyone
all day,

06:45.072 --> 06:47.475
and I am so friggin' high.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.277
Laila, Five-O.

all night long *

06:52.446 --> 06:54.281

-* Whoo

06:54.314 --> 06:56.717
* Yeah, I know
we'll turn heads forever... *

06:56.750 --> 06:59.419
-Hello, Officer.
Is there a problem or something?

06:59.453 --> 07:02.322
Your neighbors called
to complain.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.157
I'm sorry.
Was the music too loud?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.960
No, it's the smell
they were objecting to.

07:06.994 --> 07:11.499
Officer, I promise you, no one
here is smoking marijuana.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.267
Mm. Did I say "marijuana"?

07:14.301 --> 07:16.637
No, I don't believe I did.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.508
No, see, they called to say
some skanky teenage ho

07:20.541 --> 07:23.511
living up in here, bringing a
real stank to the neighborhood.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.779
Bringing down
the property values and such.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.848
I'm-a have to guess
that'll be you.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.284
Excuse me?

07:31.318 --> 07:35.155
Georgina Turner, where the hell
you think you're going?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.491
Uh, hi, Sergeant Grant.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.660
"Sergeant"

07:39.693 --> 07:43.697
You've spent the night
at my house, eaten at my table.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.365
We go way back.

07:45.398 --> 07:49.169
Go on. Tell 'em, Georgina.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.470
She's May Grant's mom.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.774
My baby was in the hospital
because of you.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.710
She nearly died.
What do you have to say to that?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.148
Good.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.316
She's a punk-ass slut.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.152
-You're under arrest.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.387
You can't do that!

08:07.420 --> 08:09.222
I saw what you hid in your bag.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.158
Huh?

08:11.191 --> 08:13.160
Hmm.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.362
-Party's over.

08:15.395 --> 08:17.531
You are in such trouble.

08:17.565 --> 08:21.068
-My father's an attorney.
-Tax attorney.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.070
Ms. Grant?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.372
Could you tell May I'm sorry?

08:25.405 --> 08:27.374
You should tell her yourself.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.984
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

08:37.017 --> 08:38.919
Where's my daughter?

08:38.952 --> 08:41.689
Laila.
-OFFICER: Hey, hey, hey!

08:41.722 --> 08:43.390
-Laila. Oh, my God.
Let go of me! -Hey, hey!

08:43.423 --> 08:45.659
-Get your hands off my wife!
-Oh, you. Grant.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.661
Or whatever your name is.
You did this?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.529
-Mrs. Creedy,

08:49.563 --> 08:51.765
-you need to calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.501
I get a call from
my daughter's friends saying

08:54.534 --> 08:56.737
that you barge into our home
and start blaming Laila

08:56.770 --> 08:59.006
for what happened
to your daughter.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.574
The hell is the matter with you?

09:00.608 --> 09:01.775
What's she being charged with?

09:01.809 --> 09:03.343
Possession of
a controlled substance.

09:03.376 --> 09:06.914
I want her released. Now.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.418
I play golf
with a top trial attorney,

09:11.451 --> 09:13.253
and he's gonna have a field day
with this case.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.555
Your daughter's going through
the system like everyone else.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.858
Was this about revenge?
Is that it?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.560
You-you got it in your head
that Laila is somehow to blame

09:20.594 --> 09:22.229
for your daughter trying
to kill herself?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.464
Don't you talk about
my daughter.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.900
You should've come to us
if you had concerns.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.435
What, like the other parents
who complained to you

09:28.468 --> 09:29.637
about Satan over there?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.038
Yeah, that's right.
I talked to them.

09:31.071 --> 09:34.942
And I know you did nothing--
not a single damn thing.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.243
Nada.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.746
Yeah, all right, I've heard
enough about what you think...

09:38.779 --> 09:41.448
You want to know why your
daughter's sitting in that cell?

09:41.481 --> 09:42.716
You failed.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.384
Your daughter is a nightmare

09:44.417 --> 09:46.419
because the two of you
are a nightmare.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.088
Now get the hell
out of my station.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.724
-OFFICER: 1178, Dockweiler
Beach.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.293
-Laila. -All units report to LAX
for emergency perimeter.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.108
OFFICER: No stopping here!
Keep it moving, keep it moving!

10:08.141 --> 10:10.110
No stopping here!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.181
Sergeant, thank you.
Really appreciate it.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.116
-Captain Dowers, airport
security.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.452
DOWERS: Well, it went down just
off Dockweiler into the water.

10:19.486 --> 10:21.321
We got departures grounded
on the taxiways.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.790
Arrivals with no gates.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.592
Got air traffic control
and NTSB up my ass.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.961
My guys are spread all over hell
trying to keep this place

10:27.995 --> 10:30.263
on lockdown till we can
figure out what's going on.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.832
I just hope to God it isn't a...

10:31.865 --> 10:33.600
: isn't a bomb
or ISIS or whatever.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.202
I know
that emergency manual cold,

10:35.235 --> 10:37.604
-but nothing prepares you for
this. -All right, just breathe.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.372
LAPD is here
and ready to assist.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.608
All right, listen, I'm-I'm...
it's gonna take some time

10:41.641 --> 10:43.110
-for us to get things moving.
-Excuse me. -Excuse us.

10:43.143 --> 10:44.878
-Yeah. -Do you have any
information about the accident?

10:44.912 --> 10:46.980
They're not telling us a thing,
and I'm looking for my husband.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.716
-All right, all right.
-His name is Dale Marks.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.651
He was in 4-B. He was probably
wearing his Mets cap.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.554
-He usually wears his Mets cap.
-I heard there were survivors.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.824
Okay, look, folks,
folks, folks, look.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.659
As soon as we have updates for
you, we will pass them along.

10:59.693 --> 11:00.894
I know this is
a difficult situation,

11:00.928 --> 11:03.163
but the finest first responders
are out there right now

11:03.196 --> 11:04.898
doing everything they can
for your loved ones.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.867
-Okay, just go with them.
-But I... I need...

11:06.900 --> 11:09.002
It breaks your heart,
doesn't it?

11:09.036 --> 11:10.570
Worst part is yet to come.

11:10.603 --> 11:11.972
MAN :
Flight 207 crew

11:12.005 --> 11:13.707
in need of assistance,
waiting to deplane.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.376
We have a passenger
who is out of control.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.712
-Copy. Officer responding.
-What, a plane just crashed

11:18.746 --> 11:20.714
and some jackass
is complaining about

11:20.748 --> 11:22.515
not getting
his extra bag of nuts?

11:22.549 --> 11:24.384
-No, sir, not today.
-Yeah.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.400
-The water's on fire.
-BOBBY: That's jet fuel.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.402
I count 12 to 15 victims
on the wing,

11:42.435 --> 11:44.037
at least 30 in the water.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.606
How long before
that thing sinks?

11:46.639 --> 11:48.942
BOBBY: Based on the timing
of the swells,

11:48.976 --> 11:50.744
I don't think
that plane can take more than

11:50.778 --> 11:54.081
four or five sets
before going down.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.117
*

12:10.163 --> 12:12.532
BUCK: Where the hell
are we gonna evacuate

12:12.565 --> 12:14.534
-BOBBY: We have to get

12:14.567 --> 12:15.969
these people out of here
and to the beach.

12:16.003 --> 12:19.106
This thing is going down
in four minutes.

12:24.644 --> 12:27.580
WOMAN:
Help! Help!

12:35.088 --> 12:37.257
Swim to the raft!
Swim to the raft!

12:37.290 --> 12:39.259
The plane is sinking!

12:39.292 --> 12:41.128
Get him up.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.096
Get in the boat. Come on!

12:43.130 --> 12:45.999
-Buck, Buck, we got somebody
here. -RICHARD: Help, please.

12:46.033 --> 12:48.401
-BOBBY: Okay, bring it
over here.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.470
I can't get my seat belt off.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.105
It's digging into me.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.507
Stay with me, sir.
Stay with me, okay?

12:54.541 --> 12:56.443
I'm gonna pull the thing
right off, okay?

12:56.476 --> 12:58.311
We're gonna do this
on three, okay?

13:00.147 --> 13:02.749
-You're okay, sir. You're okay.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.684
-Let's get him up.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.620
We're gonna get you
off the plane.

13:07.654 --> 13:10.157
-Come on, Buck, come on.
-All right.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.830
Get in the raft! Come down!

13:26.006 --> 13:28.808
-Mommy, come on, we have to go.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.210
-TAMMY: No, my...

13:30.243 --> 13:31.879
-That's right, come on,
let's go, let's go. -All right.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.881
-Pull that chair, Buck. Stop!
Stop, Buck!

13:33.914 --> 13:36.149
-Her legs are pinned.
-TAMMY: Please save him.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.951
-All right, take the kid.
-No, no!

13:37.985 --> 13:40.553
-I'm not leaving without you!
-Okay, baby, listen.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.522
Look, look.
The firemen are here, okay?

13:42.555 --> 13:45.492
I need you to get on their boat
so they can do their job.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.361
-Mm-hmm. -If everyone is worried
about you and your pretty face,

13:48.395 --> 13:52.665
how are they gonna do
what they need to do to save me?

13:52.699 --> 13:54.834
Have I ever lied to you?

13:54.868 --> 13:56.503
Then you have to believe me.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.639
I will be
with you again so soon.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.675
Mommy loves you so much.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.744
-Do this for me.
-Okay.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.915
Okay? Okay, baby.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.517
-BOBBY: All right, got to go.
I'm sorry. -Okay, okay.

14:10.550 --> 14:12.319
-Go, baby.
-Come on. I got you.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.391
BUCK:
It's gonna be okay.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.560
We'll take good care of you.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.696
That's not the last time
you're gonna see him,

14:23.730 --> 14:25.398
because I'm gonna
get you out of here.

14:25.432 --> 14:26.833
Here we go.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.502
Here we go. Careful.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.071
Good boy. I got you.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.377
I got this.

14:40.413 --> 14:43.016
Mom! Mom!

14:43.050 --> 14:44.717
:
Mom!

14:46.920 --> 14:50.723
-Mom!

14:50.757 --> 14:53.693
Buck, Buck. Go check
the back of the plane.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.328
We're running low on time.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.736
BILLY:
Please.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.642
-Get us out of here!
-It's filling up with water!

15:09.676 --> 15:11.411
HEN:
I'm coming. I'm coming.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.781
HANNAH:
Please!

15:14.814 --> 15:17.650
Hang in, hang in.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.087
They're trapped in there.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.089
Hurry, it's filling up fast.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.325
Please hurry!
I don't want to drown!

15:30.030 --> 15:32.932
BUCK :
Wait, hold the boat!

15:32.966 --> 15:34.968
-Tie the rope to the cart.

15:35.002 --> 15:37.604
-Give me the other end, come on.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.312
-I need this.
-Here, take the bag.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.116
-Okay, breathe.
-TAMMY: Okay.

15:50.550 --> 15:51.951
Oh, oh.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.788
-HANNAH: Somebody open it!

15:55.822 --> 15:58.158
Here, take this.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.060
Tie it on the end!

16:03.530 --> 16:07.067
-Good to go!
-Now, go, go, go!

16:10.703 --> 16:12.739
Everyone, stay clear!

16:25.018 --> 16:26.953
-Breathe, breathe.

16:26.986 --> 16:30.723
I got you, I got you.

16:30.757 --> 16:32.692
Come on.
There's a step.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.133
HEN: Watch your step.
Y'all walk ahead.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.435
-Get on the boat.

16:46.273 --> 16:50.477
Come on, Buck,
let's go now, now, now!

16:54.447 --> 16:56.583
BOBBY:
Take a breath!

16:56.616 --> 16:58.185
Come on, come on.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.187
Just breathe, just breathe.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.322
-You're okay, you're okay.
-WALLY: Bobby, it's time to go.

17:02.355 --> 17:05.058
-Time to go. Get out of there.
-You're okay. Come on.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.827
Evacuate all rescue personnel.
Everyone off the plane now.

17:07.860 --> 17:10.230
WALLY :
That means you too, Cap.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.565
-I need a minute.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.734
In a minute, you'll die.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.336
Do you have kids?

17:16.369 --> 17:18.037
Yes.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.773
I died giving birth to my son.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.709
I had a seizure.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.044
And eclampsia,
then my heart stopped.

17:25.078 --> 17:28.515
I remember feeling the life
leaving my body, but I said no.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.119
And I fought and I fought
to come back

17:32.152 --> 17:34.721
because a son needs his mother.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.623
You're not gonna die here.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.425
-'Cause I'm gonna get you
out of here.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.761
I swear on my life. If you
go down, I am gonna go down.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.063
Okay? Just keep fighting.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.898
-BUCK: Hey, Bobby!
-Keep fighting.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.034
-I told you to leave, Buck, now!
-Yeah!

17:48.067 --> 17:50.870
You know I'm a terrible
listener! Here, take this rope!

17:50.903 --> 17:52.572
Tie it to the seat.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.107
It works, trust me.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.775
Ready?

17:55.808 --> 17:57.977
-Buck!

17:58.010 --> 18:01.581
Buck! Buck! Buck! Buck!

18:12.992 --> 18:15.162
Oh, Bobby! Bobby!

18:17.964 --> 18:19.799
("Heavenfaced"
by The National playing)

18:19.832 --> 18:24.771
* I could walk out,
but I won't *

18:24.804 --> 18:28.341
* In my mind,
I am in your arms *

18:34.814 --> 18:38.351
* We'll all arrive

18:38.385 --> 18:42.054
-* In heaven alive

18:44.191 --> 18:49.329
* We'll all arrive.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
*

19:21.361 --> 19:22.829
The plane is going down, sir?

19:22.862 --> 19:25.832
Please, please, look.
I don't have a lot of time.

19:25.865 --> 19:27.500
I-I need to say something
to my wife.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.336
-Okay.

19:29.369 --> 19:31.671
Look, she's having
a difficult pregnancy.

19:31.704 --> 19:34.507
-So somebody needs to be with
her when she...

19:34.541 --> 19:36.343
(passengers screaming
in background)

19:36.376 --> 19:39.178
Just tell her that I was
thinking about her.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.248
And our little girl.

19:41.281 --> 19:42.849
Who I don't think I'm gonna get

19:42.882 --> 19:44.551
a chance to see
in this lifetime.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.921
I love you, Annie, so much.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.090
So, so much.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.661
And that's not gonna die,
even if I do today.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.530
And I promise you, babe,
that I'm gonna watch

19:57.564 --> 19:59.065
over you both.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.534
I'm so sorry
that I cannot come home to you.

20:01.568 --> 20:04.904
I need you to be strong
for our daughter.

20:04.937 --> 20:07.907
-You tell her that her...

20:09.742 --> 20:12.712
Hello?

20:15.482 --> 20:16.949
REPORTER :
The commercial flight

20:16.983 --> 20:18.718
out of Chicago's O'Hare Airport

20:18.751 --> 20:22.555
with 176 passengers
and six crew members on board

20:22.589 --> 20:25.558
went down just before 8:30
this evening,

20:25.592 --> 20:29.729
crashing into the Pacific Ocean
just north of Dockweiler Beach.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.864
Now, at this hour,
search and rescue operations

20:31.898 --> 20:35.234
are continuing here
with more than a dozen survivors

20:35.268 --> 20:36.936
-pulled from the water.
-It's amazing anyone survived.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.071
DAVE:
Pilot knew what he was doing.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.741
Saved a lot of folks
on the ground

20:41.774 --> 20:43.410
by putting it in the drink.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.178
It's really sad.

20:51.918 --> 20:54.020
*

20:57.189 --> 20:59.326
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

21:12.672 --> 21:15.642
Where's my mom?
I want my mom.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.949
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

21:22.982 --> 21:24.317
Watch her legs.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.486
-You're all right.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.460
JAKE :
I don't know you.

21:33.493 --> 21:34.994
I want my mom!

21:35.027 --> 21:36.228
Mom!

21:40.400 --> 21:42.702
Mom!

21:43.870 --> 21:47.340
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.681
Thank you.

21:57.384 --> 21:59.552
Captain,
Orange County crew arrived.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.221
They're gonna take point
on mop up.

22:06.493 --> 22:09.328
There's at least one family

22:09.362 --> 22:11.731
that's got a lot
to be grateful for.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.734
That's got to make you feel
pretty good, right?

22:17.404 --> 22:19.372
Yeah.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.042
*

22:37.790 --> 22:39.258
Sorry. Excuse me.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.993
-Excuse us.
-Hey.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.563
Thank you.
We owe you everything.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.264
BILLY:
You saved our lives.

22:45.297 --> 22:47.534
Oh, it's-it's a team effort,
you know?

22:47.567 --> 22:49.368
-We're getting married.
-He asked me

22:49.402 --> 22:52.371
-as soon as we made it
to dry land.

22:52.405 --> 22:54.173
That's, uh, that's great.
Congratulations.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.108
You seem like
a very nice couple.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.210
You take care of him, okay?
Excuse me.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.379
-Abby.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.048
ABBY :
Hey.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.217
I'm so sorry. Hi. Um...

23:05.251 --> 23:07.119
It's awful.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.188
Yeah. It's grim.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.791
Yeah. Are you okay?

23:11.824 --> 23:13.426
Yeah, I'm-I'm okay.

23:13.460 --> 23:16.228
Okay, well, I just--
I wanted to, um...

23:16.262 --> 23:17.730
I don't know,
this may be way out of line,

23:17.764 --> 23:20.700
but I am... I'm looking
for a survivor.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.736
-You knew someone
on this flight? -No.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.372
But a call came through
a few hours ago

23:26.405 --> 23:28.808
from the plane
as it was going down.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.409
What? Damn.

23:30.443 --> 23:32.278
I just, I don't know,
I want to see if the guy--

23:32.311 --> 23:34.714
I hope, I hope the guy made it.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.750
-Yeah, a lot of folks didn't.
-I know.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.886
His name is Dale Marks,

23:39.919 --> 23:44.757
and he's got a pregnant wife
waiting for him, and...

23:44.791 --> 23:45.792
Anyway...

23:45.825 --> 23:50.497
Let me, uh...
see what I can find out.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.131
Okay, bye.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.545
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

24:07.446 --> 24:09.081
WOMAN:
Get off of him! This is crazy!

24:09.115 --> 24:11.283
!
-MAN: You're hurting him, man.

24:11.317 --> 24:12.652
This is totally unnecessary.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.086
WOMAN: What is the matter
with you people?!

24:14.120 --> 24:16.789
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.125
Someone want to tell me
what's going on here?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.960
We have it under control.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.595
This is under control?

24:22.629 --> 24:26.098
You got this passenger
duct taped to his seat?

24:26.132 --> 24:28.701
We appreciate your concern,
Officer, but this man

24:28.735 --> 24:30.770
was causing a disturbance;
he repeatedly tried

24:30.803 --> 24:33.472
to exit the plane when
he was told to remain seated.

24:33.506 --> 24:35.474
-He assaulted an officer.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.844
I have the whole thing on video.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.646
MAN :
No, I will not sit down.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.614
I've been sitting
for, like, eight hours.

24:41.648 --> 24:42.682
Sir, I've told you
several times.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.651
-I need you to take a seat.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.619
And I've told you several times
that my father

24:46.653 --> 24:48.220
is laying in a casket
beneath this plane.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.489
Do you want to talk
to my grieving mother?

24:50.523 --> 24:52.491
Do you? Here.

24:52.525 --> 24:54.160
Hang on, Ma. Go ahead.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.896
Explain to my mother why her
husband is rotting in cargo.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.464
Okay, I'm not
gonna tell you again.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.499
-I need you to take a seat.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.068
What, are you gonna
kick my ass, huh?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.202
Sir, yes, sir.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.971
WOMAN:
Oh, my... oh, my God!

25:05.004 --> 25:06.205
You can't do that!

25:06.238 --> 25:07.473
MAN:
Oh! Oh, my God!

25:07.506 --> 25:09.742
-You can't do that!

25:09.776 --> 25:11.578
Damn.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.479
That escalated awfully fast.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.814
First of all, you want to take

25:14.847 --> 25:17.349
that duct tape
off this man's mouth?

25:17.383 --> 25:18.885
Are you insane?

25:22.889 --> 25:25.191
-Yes. Thank you.

25:25.224 --> 25:28.695
Now, tell me why these people
can't exit this plane.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.529
Yeah, we've been here
for eight hours...

25:30.563 --> 25:31.698
All right. All right.
Give me a moment.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.932
-Give me a moment.
-We got word

25:32.965 --> 25:34.066
that no one should exit

25:34.100 --> 25:35.868
-an inbound aircraft.
-I see.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.369
You got word. From who?

25:37.403 --> 25:39.606
-From the CEO of the airline.

25:39.639 --> 25:42.441
Right now we have no idea
what caused that plane to crash.

25:42.474 --> 25:44.176
So until we find out
it wasn't terrorism,

25:44.210 --> 25:45.377
nobody's getting off this plane.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.882
I-I can hardly believe
what I'm hearing.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.552
That badge says
Los Angeles Airport Police.

25:53.586 --> 25:57.123
And now you're telling me
you're taking orders from CEOs?

25:57.156 --> 25:58.691
A industry whose motto is

25:58.725 --> 26:01.093
"The customer
is always the moron"?

26:01.127 --> 26:04.063
They make a billion dollars
a year on baggage fees,

26:04.096 --> 26:05.798
and you're on their side?

26:05.832 --> 26:07.800
Your knees pressing
against the seat in front of you

26:07.834 --> 26:09.969
because they want
to add three extra rows,

26:10.002 --> 26:11.170
and you're on their side?

26:11.203 --> 26:13.572
Five damn peanuts in that bag,
and you're on their side?

26:13.606 --> 26:15.441
Oh, no, no, no, no. Not today.

26:15.474 --> 26:18.477
Because we both know
that it is perfectly safe

26:18.510 --> 26:20.479
for these people
to get off the plane.

26:20.512 --> 26:22.414
I don't give a damn
what the CEO says.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.657
-Come on. -No, you didn't
just grab my shoulder.

26:30.690 --> 26:33.425
-Don't make me...

26:33.459 --> 26:35.394
You place your hand
on my shoulder again,

26:35.427 --> 26:36.929
we gonna have a big problem.

26:36.963 --> 26:41.600
Now, you said that this customer
was causing a disturbance.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.236
Well, then,
I'm putting him under arrest

26:44.270 --> 26:45.672
for disorderly conduct.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.141
In fact, I'm arresting
everyone on this plane.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.444
They in my custody now.

26:52.478 --> 26:54.146
You are all under arrest.

26:54.180 --> 26:57.950
And that means that you are all
leaving this plane.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.940
Sorry.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.811
Uh, 52 survivors.

27:24.844 --> 27:27.814
That's pretty good, right?
This is my-my first plane crash.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.816
Mine, too. Yeah.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.818
Usually if there is
one fatality,

27:31.851 --> 27:34.887
it's-it's, like,
a four percent survival rate.

27:34.921 --> 27:38.524
I wasn't expecting
so many of the bodies to be...

27:38.557 --> 27:40.860
you know, in-in one piece.

27:40.893 --> 27:44.697
Uh, guess it makes
identifying the casualties

27:44.731 --> 27:47.700
a lot easier--
not that it's easy.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.668
Uh, can I, can I check
your list?

27:49.702 --> 27:52.872
Uh, see-see a name, um...
Dale Marks?

27:52.905 --> 27:55.507
Oh, no, I think
I remember that name.

28:03.916 --> 28:06.685
I think that name's
on the other list.

28:09.188 --> 28:10.689
Ah.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.592
All right. Um, thank you.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.736
BUCK :
I'm sorry, Abby.

28:23.770 --> 28:25.938
I know it's not
what you wanted to hear.

28:54.233 --> 28:57.203
DALE :
I love you, Annie, so much.

28:57.236 --> 28:59.571
So, so much.

28:59.605 --> 29:02.408
And that's not gonna die,
even if I do today.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.810
And I promise you, babe,

29:03.843 --> 29:06.245
that I'm gonna
watch over you both.

29:06.278 --> 29:09.248
I'm so sorry
that I cannot come home to you.

29:09.281 --> 29:11.017
I need you to be strong.

29:22.862 --> 29:24.797
*

29:50.156 --> 29:52.291
GIRL:
Daddy, what's wrong?

29:52.324 --> 29:55.594
I just had a tough day, honey.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.964
A really tough day.

29:57.997 --> 30:01.533
Because of the plane crash?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.535
A lot of people died.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.271
They did.

30:06.672 --> 30:09.108
Why aren't you crying?

30:09.141 --> 30:13.012
I don't think I have
enough tears for all of them.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.014
*

30:31.063 --> 30:32.798
A spider is not
an emergency, ma'am.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.166
-WOMAN: No, I'm telling you.
-No.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.801
If you saw the size
of this thing...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.469
It-it doesn't matter
how big the spider...

30:37.503 --> 30:40.539
-I'm gonna call animal control.
-Do not call animal control.

30:44.576 --> 30:47.113
-Annie's here.
-Oh. Thank you.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.060
-Hi.
-Hi.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.929
I'm so sorry.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.997
You sure you want to do this?

31:05.031 --> 31:06.933
-Yes.
-They're gonna release the tape.

31:06.966 --> 31:09.668
I could get them to expedite it
so you could watch it at home.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.538
No. No, I...
I need to hear it now.

31:12.571 --> 31:16.042
Okay. Uh, right this way.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.951
WOMAN:
What's your emergency?

31:24.984 --> 31:26.919
*

31:38.497 --> 31:40.266
You ready?

31:47.106 --> 31:49.008
*

32:06.425 --> 32:08.327
*

32:32.684 --> 32:35.321
*

32:55.574 --> 32:58.010
I've been asked to take action
against you for removing

32:58.044 --> 33:00.146
-the passengers from that plane.
-Great.

33:00.179 --> 33:03.149
So the CEO calls the mayor who
calls the captain who calls you?

33:03.182 --> 33:05.851
Yup, that's exactly right,
but they can all piss off.

33:05.884 --> 33:08.354
I saw the video.
You were totally justified.

33:08.387 --> 33:11.790
These airlines suck.
That's not why you're here.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.627
Okay, so, why am I here?

33:15.661 --> 33:17.729
Laila Creedy.

33:19.265 --> 33:22.234
You know who the best
police officers are, Athena?

33:22.268 --> 33:25.971
The ones who show
integrity and empathy,

33:26.004 --> 33:29.041
who use common sense?

33:29.075 --> 33:32.811
Hmm. The ones who don't
make my telephone ring.

33:32.844 --> 33:34.480
And right now,

33:34.513 --> 33:38.650
I feel as if I operate
the Athena Grant crisis hotline.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.819
What were you doing
at that party?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.188
It's-it's complicated.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.490
Look, I know about May,
and I'm sorry.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.359
I can't even imagine what
you're going through right now.

33:47.393 --> 33:50.829
The rage that must be
coursing through your veins.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.733
If there's anything I can do,
just ask.

33:56.135 --> 33:59.671
I appreciate that.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.374
You're not gonna
appreciate this.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.378
I checked the logs.

34:06.412 --> 34:08.447
Nobody called in
a noise complaint.

34:08.480 --> 34:12.050
You used your badge
to exact a personal vendetta,

34:12.084 --> 34:14.786
exposing yourself and this
entire department to a lawsuit.

34:14.820 --> 34:18.957
And no matter how justified you
or I might find your actions,

34:18.990 --> 34:23.229
there's no way the LAPD
can condone your behavior.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.897
You were out of line,
and too assertive with a minor.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.966
I'm putting you
on restricted duty,

34:27.999 --> 34:29.901
effective immediately;
you're riding the desk.

34:29.935 --> 34:32.604
Captain, wait. Please.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.474
Just-just let me iron out
this thing with my daughter.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.809
Then I'll take
whatever punishment you want.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.778
You left me no choice.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.925
Bobby?

34:53.959 --> 34:56.262
Bobby, open up!

34:56.295 --> 34:58.597
-He ever gone MIA
like this before

34:58.630 --> 35:00.432
No. Honestly, I don't,
I don't know much

35:00.466 --> 35:02.501
about his story
before he took over the house.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.103
Just that he, uh...
he's in recovery.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.276
You hear that?

35:10.309 --> 35:12.811
-I'm gonna kick it down.
-No. No, you're not.

35:12.844 --> 35:15.581
Bobby and I gave each other
spare keys

35:15.614 --> 35:18.450
just in case one of us
couldn't make it home one day.

35:22.321 --> 35:24.223
Bobby?

35:29.461 --> 35:31.163
*

35:52.484 --> 35:53.985
Bobby?

35:54.019 --> 35:56.522
Bob Hey.

35:59.258 --> 36:01.927
Come on, let's get him up.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.210
BUCK:
How long has it been?

36:21.413 --> 36:24.983
546 days.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.486
45 and a half
if we're being picky.

36:29.054 --> 36:31.189
Days. 18 months.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.394
That crash was hard-core.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.931
Yup.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.100
Thanks.

36:45.271 --> 36:47.406
We all have our breaking point.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.844
BOBBY:
Mm-hmm.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.847
Who were you cooking dinner for?

36:55.881 --> 36:59.351
There are four plates set.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.487
I don't know.
I was drunk.

37:05.257 --> 37:07.426
I am gonna be fine.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.863
This is a one-time thing,
I promise, okay?

37:11.897 --> 37:15.233
I'm good.

37:15.267 --> 37:18.470
I'm sorry I put you guys
through this.

37:18.504 --> 37:21.940
You know why
redwoods can grow so high?

37:21.973 --> 37:25.577
They move and bend
with the wind.

37:25.611 --> 37:30.181
If you stay rigid,
eventually you'll break.

37:33.352 --> 37:36.054
You calling me uptight? She's
calling me uptight, isn't she?

37:36.087 --> 37:38.457
Maybe ask for help
once in a while?

37:46.332 --> 37:48.500
:
Help.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.446
:
Oh.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.449
I'm sorry, you guys.
I'm sorry.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.452
-Don't be.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.925
Hey, Carla.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.427
Hi.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.162
Wow. Is she down already?

38:17.195 --> 38:19.297
You're good.

38:19.331 --> 38:20.866
She's down, but not out.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.134
I just threw in
her favorite DVD.

38:23.168 --> 38:25.270
-Yup.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.273
As I call it,
"Patricia Clark's lullaby."

38:28.306 --> 38:31.209
Me, too.
-Yeah, just give it 20 minutes.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.544
She'll be out like a light.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.480
It hasn't failed me once.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.882
God bless Goldie Hawn and
that mouth-watering white boy.

38:38.984 --> 38:41.453
Um, are you all
gonna be okay tonight?

38:41.487 --> 38:43.389
I can call Howard and stay,
you know.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.691
No, I'm fine.
I can take care of her.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.825
You go on home.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.159
-Okay.
-Good night, Carla.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.996
Good night.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.472
You know, if I was
as tired as you looked,

39:00.506 --> 39:02.474
I might want a little help.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.476
There's no shame in that.

39:04.510 --> 39:06.845
I'm really fine, Carla,
thank you.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.313
You go home.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.017
Appreciate it.
You're very sweet.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.019
Okay, you know what?
I'm staying.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.421
Let's get you in the bed,

39:15.454 --> 39:17.088
and I will handle
the graveyard shift.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.390
-Come on.
-Carla, I'm a grown-up person.

39:18.424 --> 39:19.725
I can take care of myself,

39:19.758 --> 39:22.728
and I can take care
of my mother, okay?

39:22.761 --> 39:24.396
Sorry.

39:24.430 --> 39:27.533
It's been a...
a rough couple days, but I'm...

39:27.566 --> 39:30.001
I apologize.
But go have a nice night.

39:30.035 --> 39:32.203
Okay? Really, we're fine.

39:32.237 --> 39:35.507
Well, I'll see you
in the morning, then.

39:35.541 --> 39:36.875
All right.

39:42.781 --> 39:45.884
Sleep well, Patricia.

39:50.422 --> 39:52.724
PATRICIA:
Honey?

39:52.758 --> 39:54.926
Hi, Mom.

39:54.960 --> 39:57.963
You're tired, huh?

39:57.996 --> 39:59.731
Yeah.

39:59.765 --> 40:03.101
You're always a little snappy
when you're tired.

40:03.134 --> 40:08.874
You always were that way, even
when you were a little a baby.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.912
See, you think
I don't remember things.

40:15.346 --> 40:17.315
You're right, Mom.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.785
You're always right.

40:22.654 --> 40:25.691
:
Oh, it's hot in here.

40:27.025 --> 40:31.129
That girl always leaves
the temperature up too high.

40:31.162 --> 40:33.131
Her name is Carla, Mom.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.300
-Carla!

40:37.168 --> 40:39.270
Ugh. Whatever.

40:39.304 --> 40:42.941
It's hot. I'm burning up.

40:42.974 --> 40:47.746
Okay, I will turn the thermostat
down in just a minute.

40:47.779 --> 40:49.648
Go to sleep, Mom.

40:49.681 --> 40:53.084
Hmm. You, too.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.343
Mom?

41:20.979 --> 41:23.815
Mom

41:25.884 --> 41:28.754
Mom? Mom!

41:30.355 --> 41:32.357
