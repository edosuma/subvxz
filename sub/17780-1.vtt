WEBVTT

00:36.391 --> 00:39.571
The 's battle plan for Eizenhower
D-Day was cakewalk

00:39.575 --> 00:42.494
compared to the preparation
of Pam for our wedding.

00:43.248 --> 00:45.542
By the time we wanted,

00:45.565 --> 00:48.547
this was the best we had.

00:48.568 --> 00:51.078
A glorious afternoon of Wellington.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.918
Gifts are another source
of tension in marriages.

00:57.302 --> 00:59.988
Husbands do not want to spend
much as their wives.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.230
Some of these guys knew
they would have to drink

01:02.278 --> 01:05.263
$ 300 champagne just to emulate.

01:05.391 --> 01:08.779
One thing, one thing only asked
this year and you did not answer.

01:08.813 --> 01:11.702
If your wife asks you how your dress looks
,

01:11.861 --> 01:15.133
never, ever say a flattery.

01:15.266 --> 01:17.577
Flattery implies that she
is big like an elephant

01:17.645 --> 01:19.467
and that she somehow miraculously he wants

01:19.520 --> 01:21.815
to reduce the size of a sheep.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.297
She is coming.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.671
I did not want to repeat the
mistakes they committed my friends.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.490
So only when
married was really safe.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.305
Really secure than I was doing.

01:54.138 --> 01:57.934
Pam was sweet, fun, super-

01:58.129 --> 02:01.270
and libido the size of Australia.

02:03.133 --> 02:06.815
By some miracle
found my perfect partner.

02:09.271 --> 02:11.095
Good afternoon everyone.

02:11.373 --> 02:13.442
Simon and Pam would like to start

02:13.506 --> 02:15.745
saying some figures who
have written for themselves

02:15.818 --> 02:18.058
with a little help from Khalil Gibran,

02:18.134 --> 02:20.959
an Arab poet who loves Pam.

02:22.108 --> 02:23.639
Love one another,

02:23.784 --> 02:27.246
but do not ye love a fetter.

02:28.007 --> 02:32.373
What there is a moving sea between
the shores of your souls.

02:32.452 --> 02:36.478
Give one another of your bread
but eat not from the same piece

02:36.640 --> 02:41.494
Stay together, but not
your too much.

02:42.373 --> 02:45.505
For the pillars of the temple stand-
separated.

02:45.686 --> 02:47.683
- Jumped a piece.
- What?

02:47.783 --> 02:50.419
Oh, fuck.
Completely forgot that shit

02:50.421 --> 02:54.060
have separate strings of the lyre
and touch the same music.

02:55.762 --> 02:57.784
- Oh, my God!
- Lowe fainted.

02:57.826 --> 02:59.815
Must be because of the Khalil Gibran.

02:59.911 --> 03:03.421
See, most of these couples never married
,

03:03.627 --> 03:09.330
That
. This is marriage.

03:09.594 --> 03:11.219
Except for him.

03:11.277 --> 03:15.080
Soul denies that there can
be better than his marriage.

03:16.225 --> 03:17.702
Is she okay?

03:17.994 --> 03:22.245
Harry,
my godfather and my best friend.

03:22.558 --> 03:24.748
Not very picky, loyal, cheerful,

03:24.750 --> 03:27.305
Loves sports, attractive
in low light.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.497
Well actually married.

03:29.595 --> 03:33.123
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

03:43.947 --> 03:46.344
The sky of Berlin seemed to be about to cry

03:46.422 --> 03:48.363
the day I got married
with Klaus.

03:48.457 --> 03:50.332
Should have been my first sign.

03:50.949 --> 03:52.832
The wedding almost did not
happen, because usually,

03:52.926 --> 03:54.763
Klaus is always running late.

03:56.119 --> 03:58.532
I was a shy student
music when I met him.

03:59.062 --> 04:00.921
He was everything I was not.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.266
I need to close the registry.

04:04.364 --> 04:06.297
- This is not good.
- No, please,

04:06.392 --> 04:08.723
Have to do that today.
We leave the country tomorrow.

04:08.805 --> 04:10.197
Please only two minutes.

04:10.273 --> 04:12.513
I would be happy to follow him
until the end of the world

04:12.599 --> 04:15.279
that's what I ended up doing,
when he was offered

04:15.335 --> 04:17.115
teach in Wellington.

04:17.212 --> 04:18.889
My mother thought deeply repugnant
,

04:18.970 --> 04:20.992
and so, of course,
I found it irresistible.

04:21.071 --> 04:23.661
Was not what his father
and I wanted for you.

04:25.277 --> 04:27.919
Took me to find the drug
of my birth certificate.

04:35.378 --> 04:38.691
- This is for you.
- Do not have time to wash?

04:42.665 --> 04:44.327
Good lighting, huh?

04:45.377 --> 04:47.853
Every day, she on the
other end of the world,

04:47.984 --> 04:50.104
and yet, will be here with you.

04:51.570 --> 04:53.395
We are going to New Zealand tomorrow.

04:58.889 --> 05:02.047
Next time, I will ask
anesthesia also.

05:02.541 --> 05:03.982
Parenthood.

05:04.051 --> 05:07.403
Is so elementary and universal
putting strangers together

05:07.730 --> 05:10.035
because of that,
and I know Harry Keith,

05:10.142 --> 05:12.783
a bank broker completely fucked.

05:13.546 --> 05:16.201
- First time?
- It is.

05:17.177 --> 05:18.653
Is that you?

05:18.720 --> 05:20.969
Is not my third.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.976
With my second.
Hers is the first.

05:24.016 --> 05:25.945
Second marriage for both.

05:26.180 --> 05:29.562
We are trying to
last time the law of marriage.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.979
Was present at the crucial moment?

05:35.140 --> 05:36.427
How is it?

05:36.590 --> 05:38.058
Birth.

05:39.262 --> 05:44.148
It was... it was beautiful.

05:45.052 --> 05:47.097
You must have been on the other end.

05:49.462 --> 05:51.340
Okay, ladies.
I would like to sit.

05:51.415 --> 05:53.131
Please crossed legs.

05:53.207 --> 05:55.846
Having children and meet
other mothers helped.

05:57.342 --> 06:00.471
Long thought not to belong to New Zealand.

06:01.534 --> 06:03.046
Glad it's over.

06:03.049 --> 06:04.613
Looks like you have milk in my breast.

06:04.624 --> 06:06.188
Keep it up and I promise I will

06:06.190 --> 06:07.608
their old bodies back.

06:07.610 --> 06:09.149
I do not want my old body back.

06:09.151 --> 06:10.715
I want it.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.590
- Introduce it to us.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:13.734 --> 06:15.534
- Katrien?
- Yes.

06:15.611 --> 06:16.876
That's Pep.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.332
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Hello, Pep.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.929
Katrien Becker.
Pleasure to meet you.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.311
- This is Pam smiling.
- Hi, Pam Nicholson.

06:22.352 --> 06:24.208
Hi, Pam.
Pleasure to meet you.

06:24.688 --> 06:28.780
I was homesick.
And the climate was a threat.

06:39.123 --> 06:41.459
But then offered me
to be the second cellist

06:41.462 --> 06:43.756
Symphony Orchestra New Zealand.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.266
I could play again.

06:48.629 --> 06:50.266
Everything changed.

07:05.537 --> 07:08.350
And that was the first time I saw.

07:09.121 --> 07:11.833
She was beautiful and perfect,

07:11.950 --> 07:14.921
in a way that only can be foreign.

07:36.782 --> 07:38.794
I got his eyes fixed on her as a baby

07:38.799 --> 07:41.444
a hanging star on top of the crib.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.965
As if nothing else mattered
worldwide.

07:46.361 --> 07:48.875
Like she worldwide.

08:15.981 --> 08:17.574
I love my children,

08:17.675 --> 08:19.367
but there's nothing like toys
feet,

08:19.529 --> 08:21.862
dirty diapers and sleep deprivation

08:21.964 --> 08:23.691
to take more paternity.

08:23.998 --> 08:26.230
Oh, for God's sake!

08:27.929 --> 08:30.793
- Is using a condom?
- Yes, I am.

08:34.032 --> 08:36.833
- Oh, I can not...
- This is the wrong house.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.640
Oh, is now good.

08:43.743 --> 08:45.872
Oh, is now good.
Do not stop.

08:45.970 --> 08:49.291
After seven years of marriage,
think our sex life

08:49.413 --> 08:51.498
is no longer that snatch hearts.

08:51.588 --> 08:54.797
This, thus, do not stop.
Do not stop, do not stop...

08:56.821 --> 08:58.105
Oh!

09:01.792 --> 09:03.293
Sorry.

09:03.597 --> 09:06.221
Seems I was very interested.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.256
Let's sleep.

09:15.871 --> 09:18.508
Hm!
Beautiful!

09:40.176 --> 09:43.592
Present 80 concerts a year
on the road in small towns

09:43.696 --> 09:47.080
playing Debussy and Stravinsky,
the most part, to people

09:47.161 --> 09:48.659
Who think that Andrew Lloyd Weber

09:48.740 --> 09:50.582
is the best songwriter of all time,

09:50.687 --> 09:53.398
is not quite as exotic as it sounds.

10:03.126 --> 10:05.179
I miss the kids terribly.

10:06.076 --> 10:07.720
I miss Klaus.

10:08.568 --> 10:11.729
The first hotel bed alone is lush
,

10:11.977 --> 10:16.257
then feels lonely and
starts getting frisky.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.261
I wanted to make a surprise for Klaus.

10:26.012 --> 10:27.789
But not like this.

10:37.075 --> 10:39.780
Like all couples,
Klaus and I had our share

10:39.880 --> 10:41.638
experience of ups and downs.

10:41.734 --> 10:44.205
- Katrien, please.
- Fuck you!

10:44.364 --> 10:46.690
- And take with you this little bitch.
- It means nothing.

10:47.078 --> 10:48.121
What?

10:48.123 --> 10:50.069
This is definitely one of the low.

10:50.161 --> 10:53.107
Take this.
I will not wash it.

10:53.193 --> 10:55.768
And take your bitches with you.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.011
Your pervert!

11:12.465 --> 11:13.923
Mom?

11:15.889 --> 11:18.625
Hello, my little monster.

11:20.645 --> 11:23.241
What do you need?

11:23.472 --> 11:25.764
I have to go to school today?

11:25.924 --> 11:29.254
Why do not we go downstairs to a breakfast

11:29.362 --> 11:30.697
and see how you will feel.

11:30.828 --> 11:32.380
I do not want to go.

11:32.557 --> 11:34.642
Well, I do not wanna go to
my essays

11:34.739 --> 11:36.594
And Dad also did not want
to go to Parliament.

11:36.758 --> 11:40.167
Come, let us put food
stomach that comes.

11:47.858 --> 11:49.563
What time back home?

11:50.657 --> 11:52.470
Simon, what time
will be home tonight?

11:52.593 --> 11:54.762
Well, Boyle has office, then...

11:55.071 --> 11:57.807
Do not be late.
I arranged a dinner tonight.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.535
Oh, fuck!

12:05.267 --> 12:07.441
Do not know about you, but
I could have a drink.

12:07.649 --> 12:10.058
- Simon?
- Too early for me, sir.

12:10.482 --> 12:13.709
- Julie?
- Do not start before eleven.

12:13.806 --> 12:16.413
's Eleven
somewhere in the world. Health!

12:18.053 --> 12:19.184
Someone?

12:19.270 --> 12:20.771
- No
- . No, no, no.

12:20.845 --> 12:22.198
As you know, this weekend

12:22.282 --> 12:25.343
Where is our colleague
Phil has a heart surgery.

12:25.473 --> 12:27.395
As he discovered he needed, I do not know.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.480
Anyway, our leaders pointed me

12:29.635 --> 12:31.814
as Acting Minister of Environment.

12:31.894 --> 12:34.595
This theme invites us to work
to save this fucked world.

12:35.107 --> 12:36.518
Sorry, honey.

12:36.738 --> 12:39.355
Gotta have a whopping bag!
Simon has the details.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.695
All that is needed to be
taken into account...

12:46.521 --> 12:47.792
I'm sorry.

12:47.857 --> 12:49.812
Besides Organization for Cooperation
and Development meeting

12:49.928 --> 12:52.190
in Berlin on climate change.

12:52.256 --> 12:53.589
Climate Change?

12:53.696 --> 12:55.730
Are you kidding me?

12:55.905 --> 12:59.135
Protocol is our Minister
make the opening speech.

12:59.230 --> 13:02.357
Christ!
I have to go?

13:04.848 --> 13:07.449
Um-hum.
Will be the keynote speaker, sir.

13:08.592 --> 13:09.966
Do not fuck me!

13:11.882 --> 13:13.185
Oh, God!

13:13.263 --> 13:14.930
Oh, forgive me.

13:20.347 --> 13:21.880
What is it?

13:21.978 --> 13:24.021
If my memory is correct,

13:24.093 --> 13:27.222
is... a prophylactic.

13:27.371 --> 13:28.592
A what?

13:28.641 --> 13:31.461
Same as condoms, sir.
Only smaller.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.853
- What did you do then?
- I flew it.

13:37.934 --> 13:41.794
- It was with a lot of pressure?
- I was too much pressure.

13:41.973 --> 13:45.429
- Of those with much delay?
- It.

13:46.969 --> 13:48.287
That bastard.

13:49.020 --> 13:51.713
Calm, all is not lost.

13:52.116 --> 13:54.186
What I'm saying is that the hottie Julie

13:54.291 --> 13:56.115
now realized that you are man

13:56.118 --> 13:58.217
juice and very horny.

13:59.058 --> 14:01.372
You
is a great comfort to me, you know that?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.378
Mom!
Mommy, Mommy!

14:10.444 --> 14:12.779
My monkeys, missed you guys.

14:12.920 --> 14:16.310
- Hi, welcome home.
- Hello!

14:16.396 --> 14:17.862
- You know, Mom?
- What?

14:17.888 --> 14:20.662
I ate my beans
and I won the first time.

14:20.772 --> 14:22.857
- Really?
- You were very good.

14:22.892 --> 14:24.014
There were children?

14:24.096 --> 14:26.832
Uhm, that joke was this?
Uhm, delicious!

14:27.029 --> 14:28.965
Hey kids, why will not drink?

14:29.146 --> 14:31.070
It has chocolate, my loves.

14:34.299 --> 14:38.021
- What's wrong?
- No, nothing is wrong.

14:38.093 --> 14:41.777
I'll tell you later.
I tell you later.

14:43.909 --> 14:46.112
Oh, my God, are you kidding me!

14:46.337 --> 14:47.903
When did it happen?

14:48.259 --> 14:49.532
This morning.

14:50.508 --> 14:52.983
The children were sleeping outside.

14:53.555 --> 14:55.704
She took an earlier flight and...

14:55.892 --> 14:59.566
caught them fucking in her bed.

15:00.140 --> 15:02.433
Oh, you bastard!

15:02.881 --> 15:04.904
- What can I do it?
- A fillet, thanks.

15:04.906 --> 15:06.261
Of course.

15:06.263 --> 15:09.227
Tell her to come to dinner with us tonight.

15:09.592 --> 15:11.002
The mistress is speaking.

15:11.460 --> 15:14.087
Now it's official.
Klaus is a bastard.

15:14.188 --> 15:16.576
And you have to
dinner with us tonight, okay?

15:19.178 --> 15:21.198
I feel so ashamed.

15:21.883 --> 15:23.839
Tell her for me she can feel

15:23.937 --> 15:25.598
angry, betrayed and hurt.

15:25.685 --> 15:27.349
It is perfectly normal.

15:28.410 --> 15:30.994
Lucy, stop staring.

15:31.386 --> 15:33.537
No need to be embarrassed.

15:33.659 --> 15:36.226
Shame is a useless emotion.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.605
You are not very hairy, is it?

15:38.784 --> 15:40.117
I think you're right.

15:40.543 --> 15:42.679
My mother has so little hair.

15:42.957 --> 15:44.027
Lucy!

15:45.055 --> 15:46.736
In her ass.

15:52.565 --> 15:54.233
Anything else?

16:04.522 --> 16:06.561
- Pamela called.
- Um-hum?

16:06.636 --> 16:09.070
Whether you take home two milks,

16:09.166 --> 16:14.588
and cheaper sherry,
but still drinkable and...

16:14.976 --> 16:16.656
something else does not happen to me.

16:16.726 --> 16:22.312
- Great. What kind of milk?
- Creamy, she thinks best.

16:22.725 --> 16:24.950
And you can, please
go home early.

16:25.663 --> 16:29.171
And to bring something
for the kids to drink.

16:29.302 --> 16:34.318
No artificial drink, since
overactive maintained.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.971
So, will find it again, huh?

16:37.067 --> 16:39.407
Well, she has about 80 years,

16:39.466 --> 16:41.176
think it is already past the middle now.

16:42.020 --> 16:46.046
- You know what I mean.
- Family Group... wives...

16:46.258 --> 16:50.166
including the beautiful
artist what you told me.

16:50.214 --> 16:52.308
Several times.

16:52.381 --> 16:54.567
Katrien be there with her husband.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.358
Oh, it's a shame.

16:58.611 --> 17:01.180
Drinks at my office in ten minutes, buddy.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.648
No, Archie.

17:02.874 --> 17:06.262
Look, I promised Pam
go home early, so...

17:06.392 --> 17:08.647
This is your first mistake.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.316
Where should say
return home as soon as possible.

17:11.411 --> 17:13.950
Sometimes you can
and sometimes you can not.

17:14.147 --> 17:16.540
I am sure, Julie, or am I right?

17:19.257 --> 17:22.867
Wake up.
Are looking.

17:22.967 --> 17:26.232
- I did it again?
- Of course you did.

17:26.586 --> 17:27.680
Sorry about that.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.712
Anyway,
drinks at my office in ten minutes.

17:33.099 --> 17:35.885
You will not leave me alone with that.

17:36.487 --> 17:39.378
It is your decision whether or not
to stay alone with Archie bebão.

17:50.131 --> 17:52.167
- Hi
- . Come with me.

17:52.994 --> 17:54.986
- Hi, Simon!
- Get in there.

17:59.295 --> 18:01.511
- There she is!
- Hey!

18:02.000 --> 18:03.582
Come.

18:04.197 --> 18:07.173
- Hi!
- Hi!

18:08.444 --> 18:11.702
If you can not help yourself,
is best not to ask.

18:12.876 --> 18:15.287
- Beautiful coat.
- Thank you.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.927
- Do not touch that.
- Oh, no! It is to nibble.

18:18.022 --> 18:20.205
Continue.
May go.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.746
- Hi, Joanne.
- Hey!

18:25.133 --> 18:28.650
- You're late.
- Affairs of State.

18:29.504 --> 18:33.722
Oh, by the way, is not sure,

18:33.807 --> 18:36.506
but I may have to go to Berlin with
Boyle in November.

18:36.515 --> 18:37.603
What?

18:38.340 --> 18:40.228
It is the month of my exams.

18:43.235 --> 18:45.561
If you have bad news,
is safer to tell Pam

18:45.632 --> 18:47.244
in front of visitors.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.319
So she can not fit a backlash.

18:52.028 --> 18:54.457
I'm just saying not to
drink too much, right?

18:54.553 --> 18:56.415
You ever smoke too much, you always
smokes.

18:56.496 --> 19:00.484
- Nicotine causes constriction
- Shut up!

19:02.161 --> 19:04.756
Hi Pep,
wants a drink and a cigarette?

19:04.916 --> 19:07.066
Do not get too cocky asshole crafty.

19:07.180 --> 19:08.548
This means that a yes?

19:08.550 --> 19:10.356
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, Pep.

19:10.397 --> 19:11.698
Oh, hello!

19:12.970 --> 19:15.665
Oh, come, come.

19:16.425 --> 19:19.325
Oh, Katrien!
Thank you for coming.

19:19.747 --> 19:21.071
Where is Picasso?

19:22.343 --> 19:25.087
- What?
- We'll talk later.

19:25.189 --> 19:27.270
Daddy does not live with us anymore.

19:27.562 --> 19:31.205
Mom caught him in bed with a naked woman.

19:31.217 --> 19:32.291
Oh, I see.

19:32.307 --> 19:38.309
Alright then. Come on people.
Let's see Lucy and Mickey Mouse.

19:40.157 --> 19:42.207
- I hope you're good.
- Thank you.

19:42.893 --> 19:44.311
Klaus is a bastard.

19:44.399 --> 19:47.202
Lucky bastard,
but still a bastard.

19:47.783 --> 19:50.144
Has not been easy for Klaus
in New Zealand.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.889
How hard can it be?

19:53.564 --> 19:56.954
He wants to join this group of men

19:57.036 --> 19:58.828
You spoke, Keith.

19:59.188 --> 20:02.840
Where you talk about the
difficulties of being married.

20:02.922 --> 20:04.918
- Is not that.
- Oh!

20:05.799 --> 20:08.506
No more vague.
I'm sorry.

20:09.567 --> 20:12.073
Apparently, it is not difficult
be married today.

20:12.138 --> 20:15.289
- It is since 1970 for me, Keith.
- So you're wrong.

20:15.378 --> 20:16.633
Today is more about

20:16.683 --> 20:19.259
find the warrior within himself.

20:19.687 --> 20:20.967
Well, if it was a group of women

20:21.032 --> 20:22.760
was just looking inside the vagina’s...

20:23.120 --> 20:24.277
Sorry.

20:24.937 --> 20:30.280
Katrien looked so vulnerable
that I wanted to hug her,

20:30.577 --> 20:33.558
Stroking her hair, smell her neck
,

20:33.702 --> 20:36.143
kiss her lips and kiss her nipples.

20:37.267 --> 20:41.351
Kissing her nipples?
Jesus, where did that come from?

20:42.479 --> 20:44.696
I could not believe what I
was thinking these things.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.784
I thought nobody had noticed.

20:51.045 --> 20:52.763
I noticed.

20:53.471 --> 20:56.209
Funny that I never noticed the
Simon before.

20:56.745 --> 20:58.447
Not that way.

20:58.589 --> 21:00.677
He was angry with Klaus
because of me.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.605
And I suppose that I appreciated that.

21:07.828 --> 21:09.916
Children, bow their music.

21:10.083 --> 21:16.351
Before, Pep
and I wanted to share something with you.

21:16.413 --> 21:17.824
I'll tell them.

21:17.885 --> 21:20.861
When you come out
you make your statement, right?

21:21.829 --> 21:25.311
Ladies and gentleman,
I decided that I am a lesbian.

21:26.098 --> 21:27.867
Nanny to increase the music, kids!

21:28.031 --> 21:30.431
Both see this as a growth.

21:30.561 --> 21:36.484
This is obviously important
for Pep and me too.

21:36.715 --> 21:42.554
I hope to be loved for who I am
and Pep for what it is.

21:42.557 --> 21:43.912
A Lesbian!

21:48.830 --> 21:50.290
Oh, what a day!

21:51.283 --> 21:53.389
Poor Keith.

21:59.265 --> 22:01.394
Katrien and Klaus probably will reconcile.

22:01.427 --> 22:02.992
Couples usually be reconciled.

22:03.989 --> 22:09.898
I think Katrien and Keith
can come to understand,

22:09.900 --> 22:11.360
meanwhile.

22:11.531 --> 22:15.702
- It is not her type.
- I do not know which type would it be?

22:17.507 --> 22:19.366
Apparently you are.

22:21.579 --> 22:24.773
Well, I'm glad you find this amusing.

22:24.854 --> 22:26.816
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

22:28.114 --> 22:31.136
Not Katrien told me that
she is sick of men.

22:31.313 --> 22:32.971
She said that next time
you have a relationship

22:33.036 --> 22:39.112
have to be with someone
shy and right as you.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.140
Jesus, thank you.

22:42.356 --> 22:44.355
Well, fuck.

22:44.455 --> 22:47.123
I did not know that was
the style of Katrien.

22:47.351 --> 22:51.265
Would have to be extraordinary from now on.

23:01.221 --> 23:02.672
Katrien!

23:12.588 --> 23:15.819
How difficult was
install me, remember?

23:19.215 --> 23:22.408
His mother was ashamed of my paintings.

23:22.755 --> 23:24.526
Thought they were not paintings.

23:30.096 --> 23:32.721
We were happy in Berlin, Katrien.

23:33.193 --> 23:35.020
We should never have left.

23:38.145 --> 23:39.875
What you want, Klaus?

23:46.254 --> 23:51.499
I behaved very badly.
I was very, very bad.

23:53.046 --> 23:54.551
I'm sorry.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.624
I'm sure he feels.

23:57.627 --> 23:59.179
I did not want that to happen.

23:59.181 --> 24:00.641
Not Sure it's my fault.

24:00.643 --> 24:02.207
I should not have put the gun to your head

24:02.209 --> 24:04.086
and forced you to have sex with that girl.

24:17.114 --> 24:19.313
I do not want we finish.

24:21.606 --> 24:23.095
She means nothing to me.

24:23.097 --> 24:25.619
- But you had sex with her.
- It means nothing.

24:25.621 --> 24:27.706
Oh, it makes me feel much better
, Klaus.

24:29.571 --> 24:32.600
You do not understand that
sex is something precious.

24:33.348 --> 24:37.552
Well, if sex is talk
as important, never talked.

24:42.913 --> 24:46.020
I made dinner for four
families tonight.

24:46.055 --> 24:48.078
I'm tired, right?

24:54.105 --> 24:58.146
I can not pull the sheet
and feel instantly...

24:58.983 --> 25:00.642
brand new.

25:01.012 --> 25:02.608
Why not?

25:05.511 --> 25:07.008
It's okay.

25:08.892 --> 25:10.260
Good night.

25:12.020 --> 25:13.376
Cool!

25:18.476 --> 25:20.350
I'll drink a drink.

25:43.116 --> 25:46.764
What happened to the woman
sexy fun and I got married.

25:49.413 --> 25:50.973
I miss her.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.378
Very clearly she does not feel the same
miss me.

26:03.053 --> 26:06.487
You say you feel guilty because
has no libido.

26:07.846 --> 26:09.613
How do you think I feel?

26:10.006 --> 26:13.559
You make me feel like
if I had to apologize.

26:13.916 --> 26:18.149
Mommy, I want to
bubbles chocolate.

26:22.930 --> 26:24.406
Very well.

26:25.439 --> 26:28.888
Have you ever laid in bed and felt guilty

26:29.179 --> 26:30.838
for being excited?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.415
We should not talk about it

26:32.417 --> 26:34.367
- in front of children.
- How do you think she got here.

26:34.370 --> 26:36.487
Go ahead,
because I tend to be scum.

26:36.489 --> 26:38.783
Oh, for God's sake!

26:38.876 --> 26:42.526
You know, every plant, every
animal, every bird, each bee...

26:42.528 --> 26:44.613
How do you think that the Pope came here?

26:44.615 --> 26:45.971
Okay, I get it.

26:45.973 --> 26:48.225
I think you should at least try.

26:48.227 --> 26:49.687
I fully agree with you.

26:50.353 --> 26:53.209
Tonight, huh?

26:53.319 --> 26:54.852
What time will be home?

26:55.047 --> 26:56.916
Well, it depends on Boyle.

26:57.852 --> 27:00.161
I know how the Pope arrived here.

27:00.272 --> 27:02.481
Mom and Dad are only
talking, dear.

27:02.528 --> 27:04.101
I know it.

27:04.167 --> 27:06.125
By plane.

27:09.840 --> 27:11.359
Can I ask you a question?

27:11.456 --> 27:13.180
Of course.
Hey, Tim.

27:14.191 --> 27:19.015
Let's have a few drinks.
Want to join us?

27:19.271 --> 27:20.576
Another time, bro.

27:20.935 --> 27:22.531
I have coffee with my niece.

27:27.196 --> 27:29.934
How many nieces do you
think that this guy has?

27:31.588 --> 27:34.603
How often do you and Joanne have sex today?

27:35.888 --> 27:38.299
Well, we'll see.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.534
When I finally got to go to bed

27:40.592 --> 27:43.247
Joanne
makes sex whenever she feels ready.

27:43.509 --> 27:44.556
The same happens to me,

27:44.633 --> 27:46.998
I do
sex every time that Joanne feels ready.

27:47.389 --> 27:49.878
- Why?
- Forget.

27:50.767 --> 27:54.424
Listen, I need a favor.

27:54.773 --> 27:56.801
Joanne is concerned with Keith.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.539
Do you think the guy is fucked.

28:00.197 --> 28:02.074
The wife wants to have sex with other women

28:02.076 --> 28:03.744
and his masculinity must be shit.

28:03.746 --> 28:05.415
She thinks we should give him more support.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.085
Is not suggesting we join that thing.

28:07.087 --> 28:08.767
Well, we can tolerate
only for a few weeks.

28:09.643 --> 28:11.394
Look, the main objective of this exercise

28:11.396 --> 28:13.289
Joanne is taking my back.

28:14.942 --> 28:17.661
Come on, can be fun.

28:18.522 --> 28:21.471
Furthermore, it can help with its
thing.

28:21.999 --> 28:23.458
What thing?

28:24.146 --> 28:26.544
What is man?
I do not have anything.

28:37.535 --> 28:39.620
Listen, before we begin, I want you to feel

28:39.622 --> 28:42.489
as if the house were to you and
are relaxed and comfortable.

28:42.492 --> 28:44.006
We have snacks there too.

28:44.413 --> 28:47.707
Hey, Klaus, good to see you.
How are you?

28:47.795 --> 28:48.885
I'm fine.

28:48.946 --> 28:50.900
Unlike you who is looking like a shit.

28:50.996 --> 28:52.918
Kind words open doors.

28:53.248 --> 28:55.624
Get out, you also
is like a shit.

28:55.876 --> 28:58.407
Okay, we all know why we're here.

28:58.526 --> 29:00.249
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey, Earl.

29:00.338 --> 29:02.042
Can I put Tracy
in your bed partner?

29:02.205 --> 29:04.640
Sandra is working,
then I do the honors.

29:04.732 --> 29:06.542
Is, second door on the left.

29:06.881 --> 29:08.268
I think the pillow.

29:10.176 --> 29:15.988
Many men are confused about what it means

29:16.077 --> 29:17.913
be a man today, so...

29:18.042 --> 29:21.871
have to go beyond these expectations

29:21.974 --> 29:25.780
and find out what
means this need.

29:26.341 --> 29:30.228
So, let's run
and introduce ourselves.

29:30.490 --> 29:33.339
Roger, would you like start?

29:35.437 --> 29:38.306
Roger Resmison, systems analyst,

29:38.410 --> 29:41.254
father of three, married to Elena.

29:41.664 --> 29:44.935
My wife and I have not made love...

29:45.021 --> 29:50.085
Made love for about five months and...

29:50.687 --> 29:52.268
I think I know why.

29:52.366 --> 29:54.545
She thinks you physically repulsive?

29:55.091 --> 29:56.844
As?

30:04.810 --> 30:08.299
I would like the group to discuss the issue

30:08.361 --> 30:12.124
intercourse long term.

30:12.508 --> 30:14.781
Do you think she feels
lack of this approach?

30:15.987 --> 30:18.288
AND... Klaus.

30:20.388 --> 30:25.354
Klaus Becher,
art teacher and painter.

30:26.631 --> 30:29.306
Although anyone buy shit.

30:30.289 --> 30:34.659
Katrien I married the day
before we came to Wellington

30:35.341 --> 30:39.186
and that was a big mistake.

30:39.966 --> 30:43.191
- Leave Germany?
- . Marry Me Not.

30:43.878 --> 30:45.734
It's over.
That's it.

30:45.900 --> 30:47.690
Not look for other legs,

30:47.786 --> 30:51.957
ignore all others titties,

30:52.891 --> 30:55.968
not dream of other xanas.

30:57.287 --> 30:58.653
Must be hard to express

30:58.737 --> 31:00.777
deep feelings in another language.

31:00.854 --> 31:03.752
Not Sex is easier
be expressed in English.

31:03.950 --> 31:06.383
German is a language very formal.

31:06.687 --> 31:08.966
Thank you have shared this with us, Klaus.

31:09.643 --> 31:11.575
And... Simon.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.821
Hi, I'm Simon Nicholson.

31:16.920 --> 31:20.643
Am first secretary of the
office of the Minister...

31:20.716 --> 31:22.728
All quiet on the eastern front?

31:23.502 --> 31:27.934
And I am married to Pamela,
my wife.

31:28.650 --> 31:30.865
And I have two wonderful children.

31:33.717 --> 31:35.427
Well, that's all, really.

31:36.177 --> 31:39.371
Do you have a problem you would
like to speak to the group?

31:39.850 --> 31:43.230
Uhm... no, no.

31:43.788 --> 31:46.288
- Do not be shy.
- Fuck you.

31:46.492 --> 31:49.392
We can tell the staff under
the umbrella of secrecy.

31:49.490 --> 31:53.694
And nothing, shit,
can leave this room, huh?

31:53.953 --> 31:56.591
See? There is.

31:58.112 --> 32:01.676
You might want to present now, Harry.

32:04.282 --> 32:07.803
Harry Ronyne journalist.
To be honest, I'm here

32:07.899 --> 32:09.809
because my wife insisted that I come.

32:10.049 --> 32:11.368
Good for her.

32:11.369 --> 32:13.089
I'd really like to be doing something else,

32:13.091 --> 32:14.613
Joanne but would not let me.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.315
Maybe it's time to let down your guard

32:17.412 --> 32:20.407
and touch his feminine side.

32:20.462 --> 32:22.212
Believe me, Keith,
if I had a feminine side

32:22.317 --> 32:23.756
'd be playing it all the time.

32:23.759 --> 32:25.469
Hey, buddy, if you do not think
would play,

32:25.471 --> 32:27.139
can go fuck right now.

32:27.188 --> 32:30.410
Hey, maybe you can introduce
now, Earl.

32:31.539 --> 32:32.821
Alright, then.

32:32.972 --> 32:35.316
I am Earl, the fireman.

32:35.522 --> 32:37.639
I left school at 15.

32:38.508 --> 32:42.494
I have a daughter, Tracy,
she is the love of my life.

32:42.822 --> 32:47.381
I think I'm here because I broke my wife.

32:47.871 --> 32:52.857
Every time she contests the
my authority, makes me crazy.

32:53.491 --> 32:56.179
A pus in the hospital twice...

32:56.749 --> 32:58.297
three times.

32:59.275 --> 33:03.414
I'm not proud of it.
Why do we do this?

33:03.641 --> 33:06.182
Well, certainly caught our attention

33:06.272 --> 33:10.213
for possible future
sessions on self-control.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.973
Always have to express anger
with his fists, right?

33:14.084 --> 33:16.579
Why do we always do this
in the first place, huh?

33:16.745 --> 33:19.466
- Huh?
- Yeah, right.

33:21.875 --> 33:26.453
Listen, I know you and Harry
do not believe much in the group.

33:26.532 --> 33:28.752
- What? No, man.
- No.

33:28.814 --> 33:30.526
You do not Vi was very comfortable

33:30.645 --> 33:32.645
especially with the presence of the Earl.

33:32.942 --> 33:37.424
He can not stay.
He has to take care of her daughter.

33:37.775 --> 33:39.942
- He brings his daughter.
- Okay, Keith.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.830
Where is your washing, partner machine?

33:41.961 --> 33:43.106
What happened?

33:43.191 --> 33:44.879
Tracy had a little accident.

33:45.024 --> 33:47.912
- What kind of accident?
- Well, strange places.

33:48.025 --> 33:50.455
I think she surprised her bed.

33:50.587 --> 33:53.323
I took the sheets before
who passed down.

33:53.385 --> 33:55.451
Before passed to the mattress.

33:55.552 --> 33:57.026
You said now, Dad.

33:57.115 --> 33:59.265
- Do not worry about it.
- Alright.

33:59.643 --> 34:01.969
- You're still here?
- Hello, ladies.

34:01.978 --> 34:03.021
Hello, Pep.

34:03.076 --> 34:04.922
I hoped that Simon was there.

34:05.829 --> 34:08.255
Shy and awkward.

34:08.355 --> 34:10.235
- How was it?
- Uh-uh...

34:10.309 --> 34:12.188
The group discussions are
strictly confidential.

34:12.196 --> 34:15.915
I do not know what to say but shy
seemed to be her type.

34:15.940 --> 34:17.034
Of course.

34:17.119 --> 34:18.583
Cheers then, Keith.

34:19.659 --> 34:22.706
Oh, it's cold outside.
Let's put your coat, dear.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.667
We did not
know that way, is not it?

34:24.668 --> 34:27.130
- I caught.
- Thank you.

34:27.217 --> 34:29.601
Let me put this jacket on you.

34:29.764 --> 34:33.184
- Oh, there it is.
- Excuse me.

34:33.264 --> 34:36.083
One more here.
Seems a tent.

34:40.255 --> 34:41.589
There is.

34:43.025 --> 34:45.333
Alright, little beauty?
Come.

34:45.822 --> 34:48.585
Segura.
Up.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.442
Pick up your mother next week, huh?

34:50.444 --> 34:51.800
Cheers.

34:54.348 --> 34:59.280
- Well, gotta go too.
- So long, partner.

35:01.115 --> 35:02.793
Goodbye, Simon.

35:13.965 --> 35:15.886
What you talk about there?

35:18.496 --> 35:20.468
I can not count.

35:22.198 --> 35:28.943
What I can say is that the wife of the Earl
loves not having sex.

35:29.122 --> 35:30.657
God!

35:32.223 --> 35:34.518
You did not talk about us?

35:34.600 --> 35:37.285
Uhm-Uhm . No

35:43.767 --> 35:45.450
Make love to me.

35:46.001 --> 35:48.033
- Seriously?
- It.

35:49.355 --> 35:52.726
- It is late.
- So let's fast.

35:59.775 --> 36:01.860
Come to me, my beast.

36:02.774 --> 36:05.966
Oh, yes!
- Oh, how nice.

36:06.132 --> 36:08.715
Oh, yes!
Ohhh!

36:08.867 --> 36:13.117
Oh, yes!
You're my sexy man!

36:13.228 --> 36:15.807
- Oh, shit!
- No, no, no. Comes.

36:15.818 --> 36:18.635
- Oh, shit, shit, shit.
- Come on, baby.

36:32.417 --> 36:36.774
It's okay. It is late.
We are both tired.

36:48.952 --> 36:50.206
It's a shame.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.432
This should not be happening

36:51.435 --> 36:52.970
a man at my age.

36:53.067 --> 36:54.392
Some women find flattering.

36:54.450 --> 36:56.293
And Pam does not help.
Always pushes me.

36:56.591 --> 36:59.095
Another night I asked if
she wanted to make love

36:59.159 --> 37:01.114
and she continued reading a book.

37:02.064 --> 37:03.420
What book?

37:03.939 --> 37:05.987
How so, what book?
This is not the point?

37:06.099 --> 37:08.235
- I'm curious.
- I do not know.

37:08.762 --> 37:11.151
Something about farms in Provence.

37:11.708 --> 37:14.117
So it's more serious than I thought.

37:14.146 --> 37:15.240
Carry on.

37:15.309 --> 37:17.440
The other time,
make fast, she said.

37:17.982 --> 37:20.405
It was very fast. Quick
too.

37:20.489 --> 37:21.602
And the good Lord knows.

37:21.724 --> 37:22.948
It's like she does not give a damn.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.617
It's like she forced a little
my premature ejaculation.

37:28.266 --> 37:29.602
Two things.

37:29.848 --> 37:33.220
First, fire does not hurt
no healthy woman.

37:33.315 --> 37:36.367
Second, there is no such thing
premature ejaculation.

37:36.386 --> 37:39.068
There is the
delayed orgasm and the sooner women

37:39.070 --> 37:40.867
consult a doctor to see the condition,

37:40.869 --> 37:42.537
- best for all of them.
- Oh!

37:46.504 --> 37:49.190
- Who is this fucking guy.?
- Not even want to know the name.

37:59.424 --> 38:01.019
Good Morning.

38:03.694 --> 38:06.577
- I came to pick up the kids.
- Sure. Come in.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.751
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, Mom.

38:13.032 --> 38:15.148
Kimberly made pancakes for us.

38:17.898 --> 38:19.136
Hi

38:19.935 --> 38:21.871
You're spoiling them.

38:22.231 --> 38:24.240
We were up late last night, so...

38:24.242 --> 38:25.993
let them sleep a little longer.

38:27.171 --> 38:28.800
Sally, go get your shoes.

38:30.993 --> 38:34.077
- Um, was it tasty?
- Um-hum.

38:39.143 --> 38:41.177
Kimberly looks cool kids?

38:41.271 --> 38:43.746
She let us do whatever we want.

38:43.829 --> 38:46.028
I do not need any dish washing.

38:49.147 --> 38:51.294
- And they call it?
- Sorry, guys.

38:51.370 --> 38:54.369
- Where are the others?
- Hey, baby.

38:54.435 --> 38:57.226
- Exploring the creek.
- We go?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.836
Yes, it is perfectly safe.

38:58.838 --> 39:00.194
Simon is there.

39:00.196 --> 39:01.905
Go on, then.
Go there.

39:01.963 --> 39:03.973
And do everything that Simon say to you.

39:04.981 --> 39:06.037
Let me guess.

39:06.085 --> 39:08.118
The children were with Klaus last night.

39:08.608 --> 39:10.726
Were still in my pajamas when I got

39:10.789 --> 39:13.008
and of course could not find the shoes.

39:13.074 --> 39:14.635
Any sign of the boss?

39:15.093 --> 39:21.999
The artist and the resident did
pancakes with whipped cream.

39:22.350 --> 39:24.642
- Bitch!
- I was bribing them.

39:24.706 --> 39:26.986
It is difficult to engage in it,
can tell you.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.820
Fuck, I think
is trying to say "fuck".

39:30.246 --> 39:31.515
Well, we can eat.

39:31.776 --> 39:33.457
The meat is totally fucked.

39:34.206 --> 39:36.294
I'll get the kids.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.176
Do not go too far, kids!

39:45.211 --> 39:46.904
- OK!
- Okay!

40:02.121 --> 40:04.011
Lunch is ready, kids!

40:04.284 --> 40:05.495
Hi!

40:07.271 --> 40:10.117
- Oh Hi.!
- Oh, my God!

40:17.008 --> 40:18.783
Give me your hand.

40:22.759 --> 40:25.938
- I fell!
- Yeah, you fell.

40:27.017 --> 40:28.559
Wait a minute.

40:30.077 --> 40:31.883
Promise I will not tell anyone.

40:34.176 --> 40:36.493
- Thank you.
- Right.

40:38.235 --> 40:41.686
- Run, Mother!
- Santa!

40:44.898 --> 40:48.048
Daddy, he's stuck.

40:48.545 --> 40:52.482
OK.
Children, stay back there.

40:56.751 --> 41:00.159
Hey, okay.

41:01.030 --> 41:02.603
He'll be fine.

41:06.414 --> 41:09.802
- Hey!
- Hey!

41:12.737 --> 41:14.627
Very brave!

41:16.596 --> 41:17.908
All right.

41:17.964 --> 41:20.556
- Come children.
- Come all.

41:20.575 --> 41:21.951
Come on, come on.

41:26.456 --> 41:28.310
He injured his leg.

41:28.375 --> 41:31.143
Yeah, I'll have to shear the wool
to see what happened, is not it?

41:31.201 --> 41:32.415
Um-hum.

41:33.363 --> 41:36.293
- What do you think, Archie?
- Dog Food, partner.

41:36.507 --> 41:38.907
Do not go shoot him in front of
the children, for God's sake.

41:38.965 --> 41:41.474
I will not shoot him, Simon.
Give me some credit.

41:43.884 --> 41:46.767
- Goodbye, little lamb.
- Say goodbye.

41:46.998 --> 41:49.229
Lamb, goodbye!

42:03.875 --> 42:07.042
- No!
- No!

42:08.083 --> 42:12.070
- It was our lamb.
- Jesus was not our lamb.

42:12.189 --> 42:14.095
It was our lamb, Lucy, dear.

42:14.162 --> 42:16.699
It was our lamb.
Our wool had.

42:16.765 --> 42:19.433
- No!
- Oh, for God's sake!

42:19.435 --> 42:20.502
What?

42:21.051 --> 42:22.991
It's okay?
Thomas is having an asthma attack

42:22.993 --> 42:25.704
and not want to go back. Please
can drive my car

42:25.706 --> 42:27.583
- for me to go in the back seat.
- Simon will direct.

42:27.585 --> 42:30.963
You should go, dear.
Pam will direct.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.425
You could drive?

42:32.427 --> 42:34.033
I could not believe my luck.

42:34.035 --> 42:35.494
Thank you, love.

42:38.009 --> 42:42.264
When the planets align
thus, what can we do?

42:49.440 --> 42:53.586
Hey, the first time in this place
thought I saw an ice cream parlor.

42:53.925 --> 42:56.219
- There is one.
- I saw it first.

42:56.301 --> 42:58.245
Well, as today was a hot day

42:58.309 --> 43:00.314
think we all deserve an ice cream.

43:00.601 --> 43:03.295
Is.
Is.

43:16.479 --> 43:19.760
There is no light.
What place.

43:24.255 --> 43:29.384
- Want a drink?
- Pam will be here soon.

43:31.763 --> 43:33.117
Saw.

43:34.539 --> 43:36.896
Well, all right.

43:37.663 --> 43:39.015
Thank you.

43:39.113 --> 43:40.398
Oh!

43:45.197 --> 43:46.819
Thank you, Simon.

43:47.888 --> 43:49.711
I felt wonderful.

43:50.851 --> 43:52.420
But wrong.

43:55.723 --> 43:59.037
Wrong is pretending to be happy
in a relationship when you're not

44:00.380 --> 44:03.171
Wrong is accepting exhaustive pretense.

44:10.839 --> 44:12.959
Maybe I've been selfish.

44:13.635 --> 44:15.205
Maybe I was.

44:15.883 --> 44:18.239
But I was not all the time
in my marriage.

44:19.596 --> 44:21.527
And where it got me?

44:24.038 --> 44:26.827
I heard you went
Katrien's car the other day.

44:26.903 --> 44:28.370
That was the idea Pam.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.444
I can imagine how you resisted.

44:30.522 --> 44:32.963
For God's sake, Harry,
I was only nice to her.

44:33.453 --> 44:35.539
Best keep it that way.

44:36.727 --> 44:38.176
Oh, you who's calling?

44:38.699 --> 44:40.196
Am I never jumped the fence

44:40.267 --> 44:41.796
And walked fucking around.

44:41.882 --> 44:43.002
While you and the other guys

44:43.014 --> 44:44.319
are always partying,

44:44.382 --> 44:46.538
I'm with Pam like a good boy.

44:46.731 --> 44:48.589
And where it got me.

44:49.680 --> 44:51.440
A wife who finds me boring.

44:53.319 --> 44:55.478
Katrien finds me fascinating.

44:57.130 --> 44:59.584
Do you remember how
that feeling, Harry?

44:59.747 --> 45:01.736
When someone thinks you're hot.

45:04.178 --> 45:06.937
And if I told you that Julie finds
exciting you?

45:10.656 --> 45:13.464
- She thinks?
- No

45:17.908 --> 45:20.450
The next phase was a dinner
family's house Katrien.

45:21.380 --> 45:23.484
I told Pam that
would have to work until later

45:23.554 --> 45:25.194
As I could.

45:26.332 --> 45:28.996
If I were there late enough
Katrien could be alone.

45:30.732 --> 45:33.068
For several hours thought
to retreat or continue.

45:34.154 --> 45:35.839
Had to go home.

45:56.112 --> 45:57.615
- Hi
- Hey.

45:57.701 --> 45:59.323
- Come in.
- Sorry I'm late.

45:59.407 --> 46:01.604
I had a lot of work.

46:01.684 --> 46:03.336
No worries.
It's okay.

46:03.444 --> 46:05.741
Please.

46:07.687 --> 46:11.156
Thank you came just to tell me that.

46:12.580 --> 46:16.499
I must say that now all gone.

46:16.586 --> 46:20.342
Oh, so I'm even too late.

46:20.409 --> 46:21.684
Alright.

46:22.410 --> 46:23.453
I'm sorry.

46:23.486 --> 46:27.014
While you're here, want to get
to have a drink.

46:27.510 --> 46:28.749
Of course.

46:29.144 --> 46:30.837
- Whiskey?
- Okay.

46:32.176 --> 46:35.902
Only... Well, feel free.

46:36.099 --> 46:37.519
OK.

46:56.217 --> 46:58.316
Well, I see you met my pet.

46:59.999 --> 47:03.058
Is.
Thanks.

47:03.349 --> 47:04.705
Oh, just...

47:07.099 --> 47:09.284
- Health!
- Health!

47:15.461 --> 47:17.547
Children, were not you?

47:18.279 --> 47:22.186
- All artists.
- Yes, it's Thomas.

47:23.093 --> 47:29.344
It is amazing, so much freedom
and expressive colors...

48:02.670 --> 48:05.225
- Should I go?
- Yeah, I guess.

48:06.909 --> 48:08.484
Would be better.

48:09.004 --> 48:10.506
Nothing happened.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.749
But it happened.

48:14.630 --> 48:16.627
I was officially fucked.

48:18.718 --> 48:20.293
This had to stop.

48:20.559 --> 48:22.689
Simon was married to one of my friends.

48:22.865 --> 48:25.993
And I was corrupting
luring him first.

48:28.132 --> 48:30.936
His reliability and his decency.

48:35.137 --> 48:36.738
The kids are fine.

48:37.515 --> 48:39.688
I Am...

48:42.505 --> 48:47.199
- I'm so lonely.
- I...

48:47.446 --> 48:50.029
- I'm so sad, Mommy.
- I know.

48:50.897 --> 48:52.280
You'll be fine,

48:52.341 --> 48:56.904
you just need to get out and meet some men.

48:57.018 --> 49:00.993
Is.
Meet men.

49:01.848 --> 49:04.822
- And you're... you're...
- Mom, please.

49:06.013 --> 49:09.907
Look, you need to meet someone different...

49:10.168 --> 49:12.871
Someone more like you.

49:13.426 --> 49:16.961
- You know?
- Okay.

49:19.364 --> 49:24.273
Thank you, Mom.
I'll be fine. Love you.

49:32.152 --> 49:34.302
That's why I like it.

49:34.369 --> 49:36.051
Is always a novelty.

49:37.170 --> 49:38.855
I went to a concert,

49:38.929 --> 49:40.907
Germany, when I was a student.

49:41.112 --> 49:46.672
They say the empty
old streets are dead to dreams.

49:48.153 --> 49:52.191
Are wet because of the time in Berlin.

49:53.822 --> 49:57.049
Here, you can dream,
you can be anything.

49:57.698 --> 50:00.926
If you put a cutaway tomorrow
and out saying, I'm your bitch,

50:00.989 --> 50:02.945
No one will even venture to look.

50:03.334 --> 50:07.080
I always thought a man wearing tuxedo
is not good.

50:07.344 --> 50:12.265
Yeah, the other day I saw six guys
leaving the station naturally.

50:12.722 --> 50:14.794
They should be uniform, I hope.

50:14.867 --> 50:16.749
I mean, if a man finds
another man attractive

50:16.824 --> 50:18.325
it really does not bother me.

50:18.420 --> 50:20.531
American College
know what I'm saying.

50:20.572 --> 50:24.026
A woman who loves finds a man attractive.

50:24.535 --> 50:26.698
Now, as a woman can fall in love with
a man?

50:26.893 --> 50:28.874
I am always surprised when
I see some guys parked

50:28.876 --> 50:30.773
flirting in some blocks some transvestites.

50:30.775 --> 50:31.818
Thank you.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.279
If a woman finds attractive another woman

50:33.301 --> 50:35.234
there is usually no sense.

50:35.494 --> 50:38.800
The amazing here is that
to lesbians there forever.

50:39.687 --> 50:41.544
Well, Pep also
understands this well.

50:42.368 --> 50:44.265
All your women, you know?

50:45.453 --> 50:47.078
She thinks Joanne attractive?

50:47.225 --> 50:51.840
Yes, although she has slept with Katrien.

50:52.632 --> 50:53.772
Fuck the hell!

50:53.824 --> 50:55.500
Pep was sleeping with Katrien?

50:55.749 --> 50:57.617
Before or after I have it dropped?

51:09.571 --> 51:12.569
Hey, Katrien met someone.
Is not it great?

51:14.137 --> 51:16.586
It is fabulous.
Who?

51:16.864 --> 51:18.665
An Albanian instructor.

51:19.155 --> 51:23.267
It seems kind.
I am so happy for her.

51:25.459 --> 51:27.186
Yeah, me too.

51:41.544 --> 51:43.110
Charlotte!

51:44.989 --> 51:49.551
- Well, you make this wine?
- My uncle does.

51:50.047 --> 51:51.403
Let's just stop breathing.

51:52.732 --> 51:55.183
Do not you mean that alcohol is for me.

51:55.836 --> 51:58.148
You need to try this one, mate.

52:01.003 --> 52:03.186
You may find watery medium.

52:10.967 --> 52:12.743
Is a bit thin.

52:13.787 --> 52:16.380
Therefore leaked, is not, mate?

52:17.045 --> 52:19.594
You are swimming instructor
of Katrien, is not it?

52:19.747 --> 52:21.205
Yes, I am.

52:23.357 --> 52:24.802
How did you meet?

52:25.581 --> 52:28.612
I was in a pub and he
fell upon me like a scud.

52:28.773 --> 52:30.013
No doubt fell.

52:30.613 --> 52:33.206
You are not the only
acting fast here, Romeo.

52:36.903 --> 52:38.647
He is so sexy.

52:39.356 --> 52:40.926
You are so perverted.

52:42.148 --> 52:43.743
Do not mind me.

52:45.021 --> 52:46.391
I tell you to go in Berlin?

52:47.461 --> 52:51.271
The site is described as idyllic.
We have to get to know.

52:55.491 --> 52:58.097
Hung like a Japanese rhinoceros
walking down the street.

52:59.001 --> 53:00.854
Pep, you realize that
the Japanese rhinoceros

53:00.932 --> 53:02.585
is the smallest of all rhinos.

53:02.650 --> 53:04.371
I noticed a twinge of envy, Harry?

53:04.451 --> 53:06.245
Looks more like a pig
than a rhino.

53:06.896 --> 53:08.428
Still gorgeous,

53:08.458 --> 53:09.524
'm seriously considering

53:09.572 --> 53:11.309
back in my sexuality.

53:11.491 --> 53:13.873
Honey, I'll get some
drink for children.

53:13.949 --> 53:15.440
- You could...
- No

53:21.429 --> 53:24.017
Oh.!
Oh, stop!

53:24.133 --> 53:25.884
You're so crazy.

53:27.608 --> 53:31.356
Daddy, I had a little accident.

53:33.713 --> 53:37.396
OK.
Oh, it is! Oh, it is!

53:41.823 --> 53:43.596
- Gonna get?
- No

53:59.946 --> 54:01.025
Hey!

54:03.580 --> 54:06.445
I got the impression that
you avoided me yesterday?

54:06.583 --> 54:09.106
God
do not know where you got that impression.

54:09.624 --> 54:11.824
You
was so preoccupied with his toy.

54:11.895 --> 54:13.307
This is childish?

54:14.372 --> 54:16.438
Incidentally, returning
the fuck man.

54:16.500 --> 54:17.899
How is the guy for you?

54:17.966 --> 54:19.435
What do you mean?

54:19.847 --> 54:23.049
- You know what I mean.
- Fuck you!

54:24.601 --> 54:26.471
Fuck you too.

54:28.285 --> 54:33.377
We have 4 questions on paper.
Here is his profile.

54:38.559 --> 54:40.987
- Archie.
- Oh, here, right.

54:41.085 --> 54:42.776
Luxurious Nothing I hope.

54:42.874 --> 54:44.464
I hate working with big words.

54:44.538 --> 54:48.634
You'll be monosyllabic,
but very convincing.

54:49.295 --> 54:51.723
You'll love it.
Thanks, guys.

54:53.336 --> 54:57.229
Oh, Simon, you can take
Pam climate this forum?

54:57.587 --> 54:59.362
A lot of your kindness, Archie,

54:59.414 --> 55:01.633
but she has exams this week, so...

55:02.815 --> 55:04.319
Fair enough.

55:11.894 --> 55:13.149
Hi, Archie.

55:13.192 --> 55:14.944
I have two questions for you, doll.

55:15.012 --> 55:16.265
Your passport is up to date?

55:16.331 --> 55:17.805
Can you keep a secret?

55:17.901 --> 55:19.072
Yes.

55:19.573 --> 55:22.301
I want you to go to Berlin
us, my guest.

55:23.264 --> 55:26.786
Oh,
is very generous of you, Archie,

55:26.876 --> 55:30.225
but I have an exam in the
afternoon you will fly.

55:30.289 --> 55:31.474
- He wants me to go to Berlin.
- I know that.

55:31.483 --> 55:33.047
I'll put you on another flight.

55:33.049 --> 55:35.041
And do not tell your pathetic
addicted husband in work

55:35.043 --> 55:36.745
and do not intend to tell.

55:36.937 --> 55:38.969
I want to make the biggest
surprise of his life

55:39.029 --> 55:40.878
and want you to have some fun.

55:40.955 --> 55:42.258
It will be our secret, right?

55:42.306 --> 55:43.518
Archie, I...

55:43.661 --> 55:45.710
No, it's out of the question.

55:45.766 --> 55:49.246
Do not tell yet, think of it
and will be our little secret.

55:49.343 --> 55:53.074
Archie!
I can not really go!

55:53.138 --> 55:54.899
Of course you can.

55:55.144 --> 55:57.178
Archie, sorry,
'm hearing the baby cry.

55:57.246 --> 55:59.394
I have to go, right?
Thanks. See you.

56:01.676 --> 56:02.914
What?

56:04.058 --> 56:07.996
I can not. I have an exam.
And I have nothing to wear.

56:08.940 --> 56:11.033
Honey, you do not buy clothes for traveling
,

56:11.081 --> 56:12.671
you travel to buy clothes.

56:12.743 --> 56:14.744
Joan, have two children
to create.

56:14.885 --> 56:16.402
And a husband.

56:16.506 --> 56:18.957
When was the last time you had a vacation?

56:18.993 --> 56:21.550
Together, just you two, huh?

56:28.876 --> 56:30.115
Good Morning.

56:36.215 --> 56:37.988
I'm looking for Mr. Nicholson.

56:37.990 --> 56:39.033
Oh!

56:39.714 --> 56:40.971
Katrien.

56:42.249 --> 56:44.060
Do not tell me you forgot lunch.

56:44.514 --> 56:48.073
No Yes Julie, Katrien.

56:48.898 --> 56:50.208
Nice to meet you.

56:50.957 --> 56:53.983
Mrs. . Simpson, ah,
you already met.

56:54.067 --> 56:55.120
Pleasure.

56:55.464 --> 56:57.027
- Lunch.
- Good

56:58.449 --> 57:00.063
Nice to meet them..

57:05.630 --> 57:07.883
. Mrs. Simpson, may I ask
you a personal question?

57:09.431 --> 57:11.607
Do you think older men attractive?

57:12.731 --> 57:15.731
Well, Mr. Simpson
is an old man... now.

57:16.252 --> 57:18.441
But to be perfectly frank with you
, Julie,

57:18.444 --> 57:22.423
my answer to this question has to be
"no."

57:25.342 --> 57:26.563
Right.

57:27.820 --> 57:29.807
So Pep and I slept together.

57:29.871 --> 57:31.231
That's none of my business.

57:31.308 --> 57:32.660
After Klaus had left me,

57:32.726 --> 57:35.086
Pep
came with a bottle of champagne and drank.

57:35.823 --> 57:38.537
And she began to speak of
how much she wanted...

57:39.862 --> 57:41.732
how much she wanted to sleep with me.

57:41.734 --> 57:42.829
That's not my...

57:42.831 --> 57:44.186
I said she was being ridiculous
,

57:44.188 --> 57:46.619
she began to cry,
then fainted and I went to sleep.

57:46.869 --> 57:48.367
I understand that you do not
want to hear about it,

57:48.441 --> 57:49.779
but I want you to know the truth.

57:49.830 --> 57:53.201
- Ready to order?
- Huh? No

57:54.831 --> 57:56.057
Yet.

57:58.444 --> 57:59.921
You're so...

58:00.603 --> 58:02.529
- Strange?
- It.

58:08.132 --> 58:09.938
I love you.

58:12.513 --> 58:14.907
You need to know that
Nick and I are not together anymore.

58:14.974 --> 58:17.831
- As?
- I was a complete idiot.

58:18.025 --> 58:20.071
Do not need a man in my life now.

58:21.579 --> 58:25.846
Neither he nor you.

58:29.237 --> 58:33.294
So you can sleep with that kind

58:33.363 --> 58:34.665
but can not sleep with me?

58:34.725 --> 58:36.521
I can not, Simon.

58:38.149 --> 58:40.500
- You will suffer.
- Maybe.

58:40.591 --> 58:42.057
He's right.

58:42.237 --> 58:44.142
- Hi
- Who do I see.

58:44.614 --> 58:46.588
Hey! Hey.

58:47.130 --> 58:48.557
Who can it be?

58:48.670 --> 58:51.326
Tim Bristow, and...

58:51.407 --> 58:53.708
- Linda!
- This is the Katrien.

58:53.788 --> 58:55.235
You can call me Tim.

58:55.538 --> 58:58.641
Katrien, what a lovely name! Dutch
, is not it?

59:01.248 --> 59:04.571
Well, we should let them.

59:17.205 --> 59:18.977
Children will
to a party on Tuesday

59:18.979 --> 59:20.965
and not return home before eight o'clock.

59:28.214 --> 59:29.623
No

59:38.941 --> 59:41.273
- Are you sick?
- I'm leaving.

59:41.306 --> 59:42.824
Good You work hard.

59:42.969 --> 59:46.095
This will not take long.
Just a quickie.

59:46.797 --> 59:48.194
Two fingers.

59:49.547 --> 59:52.899
I do not have many regrets, Simon,

59:53.051 --> 59:56.256
but I wished he had spent more time with my
children

59:56.337 --> 59:57.819
when they were little.

59:57.889 --> 01:00:00.298
Youth is certainly a short period of time.

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:05.019
You wake up one day and they've grown.

01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:17.310
- What was I saying?
- Children.

01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:20.685
Children?
Ah, children, is...

01:00:22.534 --> 01:00:24.000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:00:29.404 --> 01:00:31.427
I knew I had to put a stop to it.

01:00:31.487 --> 01:00:33.801
But decided I should tell her face to face.

01:00:33.938 --> 01:00:35.266
- Oh, God!
- Between.

01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:36.735
I'm sorry I'm late.

01:00:37.648 --> 01:00:39.003
Big mistake.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.968
Let's rock and let's have a chat?

01:00:48.216 --> 01:00:49.927
- We have not much time.
- It.

01:01:07.004 --> 01:01:08.792
Oh!

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:10.943
Oh, no, no, no.

01:01:12.296 --> 01:01:13.648
Are you okay?

01:01:18.013 --> 01:01:19.805
I'm sorry.

01:01:25.195 --> 01:01:26.643
Oh!

01:01:34.574 --> 01:01:36.053
Oh, God!

01:01:36.903 --> 01:01:38.740
Sorry, I feel ridiculous.

01:01:38.835 --> 01:01:42.941
No, you're amazing! Obviously.

01:01:51.706 --> 01:01:53.207
Oh, God!

01:01:56.022 --> 01:01:57.494
Oh, boy!

01:01:58.549 --> 01:02:01.158
Sorry, this never happened to me before.

01:02:05.032 --> 01:02:08.223
Look, give me five minutes.
Five minutes and I...

01:02:08.353 --> 01:02:09.596
'll be good.

01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:11.645
Well,
kids will be back in a minute.

01:02:15.588 --> 01:02:18.019
I'm free after eleven tomorrow.

01:02:19.537 --> 01:02:21.294
Ohhh!

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:26.684
- I'd better tell you.
- What?

01:02:27.384 --> 01:02:30.205
The children never saw her
grandmother before then...

01:02:31.073 --> 01:02:33.879
going to Germany for a while.

01:02:33.944 --> 01:02:35.400
But it is not Dutch.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.787
, but she is a professor of history

01:02:37.806 --> 01:02:40.200
at the University of Potsdam,
then we go to Germany.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.354
Wait a minute.

01:02:45.671 --> 01:02:47.563
When are you going?

01:02:48.121 --> 01:02:49.650
In four weeks.

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:52.531
Is fantastic.

01:02:52.927 --> 01:02:54.617
I'll be in Berlin.

01:02:55.448 --> 01:02:57.077
Can be very good.

01:03:00.012 --> 01:03:02.332
- You're not - I mean I dislike

01:03:02.374 --> 01:03:04.884
the idea of my children go
to the other side of the world...

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:06.766
without me.

01:03:06.807 --> 01:03:09.232
- In my opinion, it is illegal.
- I do not like it.

01:03:09.297 --> 01:03:10.805
Why Granny does not come here?

01:03:10.867 --> 01:03:12.172
Guys, guys...

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.823
And if Klaus wanted to take the children

01:03:14.886 --> 01:03:16.449
to meet his parents?

01:03:16.517 --> 01:03:18.926
Like Klaus would feel if
Katrien not give permission?

01:03:19.026 --> 01:03:20.704
- Puto life.
- Exactly.

01:03:21.438 --> 01:03:22.905
It's all about confidence.

01:03:23.489 --> 01:03:25.681
Or do you trust someone or not.

01:03:26.619 --> 01:03:30.803
Katrien and trust me...
I fucked one out.

01:03:31.423 --> 01:03:33.655
I took a girl on film last week.

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:36.627
Sorry.
Oh, sorry.

01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:39.814
I was at a spa, all flirting world

01:03:39.894 --> 01:03:42.310
a girl at the bar
dodging carefree.

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.490
She invited me to her apartment.

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:46.806
It was incredible.

01:03:46.882 --> 01:03:50.190
I forgot how good sex can be.

01:03:50.746 --> 01:03:54.476
When I got home, I confessed everything to
Elaine.

01:03:55.559 --> 01:03:56.774
Big mistake.

01:03:57.130 --> 01:04:00.065
The unbelievable happened.
We have all night.

01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:02.236
So good mistake.

01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:04.269
She is insisting on doing at least...

01:04:05.412 --> 01:04:07.662
twice a day since then.

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.747
Obligation of sex.

01:04:09.997 --> 01:04:12.536
When you feel safe
will cut transaction.

01:04:13.429 --> 01:04:14.918
What the fuck does that mean?

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.518
Obligation of sex is when a woman bride

01:04:17.597 --> 01:04:19.324
or meets a man she thinks is good provider

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:20.806
to any descendants.

01:04:20.912 --> 01:04:22.485
During this mandatory period,

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:24.375
she can fuck
hanging from a chandelier

01:04:24.414 --> 01:04:26.657
a restaurant and even
upon a tombstone

01:04:26.722 --> 01:04:28.386
during funerals.

01:04:28.451 --> 01:04:29.770
With Katie went anyway.

01:04:29.871 --> 01:04:31.137
When the obligation is cheap,

01:04:31.219 --> 01:04:33.434
it reduces the requirement
for the minimum possible

01:04:33.496 --> 01:04:35.696
only to avoid the obligation of
sex with another person.

01:04:35.933 --> 01:04:37.367
You are a sick fuck.

01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:40.015
What about the reality of minimizing

01:04:40.130 --> 01:04:42.318
regarding demand,
he's absolutely right.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.471
Mount of shit.

01:04:43.533 --> 01:04:44.853
Who are the rapists
in this world?

01:04:44.890 --> 01:04:46.778
They are fucking arrogant
like you.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:48.134
Ah, enough already.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.002
What gives you the right to call me
rapist?

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:51.735
Do you have the equipment,
guy ass.

01:04:52.191 --> 01:04:53.672
You have a right only because
I have the equipment?

01:04:53.736 --> 01:04:55.042
I think you heard me.

01:04:56.387 --> 01:04:58.326
His wife walked
eating people, Earl?

01:04:58.367 --> 01:05:00.047
- For God's sake, Harry!
- If I'm a rapist,

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:01.830
- then she is a cannibal.
- I'm warning you.

01:05:01.913 --> 01:05:03.623
She has the equipment,
has some teeth,

01:05:03.704 --> 01:05:04.761
have a good digestive system.

01:05:04.813 --> 01:05:06.693
Let's face it, his wife is a cannibal
potential.

01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:09.703
And you being a firefighter,
can take the baked people.

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:10.825
Earl!

01:05:10.857 --> 01:05:13.141
Hey!

01:05:13.315 --> 01:05:14.718
Earl, bring it back!

01:05:15.076 --> 01:05:16.184
Put ​​me down!

01:05:16.315 --> 01:05:17.813
Your guy ass!

01:05:35.243 --> 01:05:38.355
All right.
So where were we?

01:05:39.646 --> 01:05:40.821
What?

01:05:40.905 --> 01:05:42.674
You heard me warning him.

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:45.347
Oh, Harry!

01:05:45.425 --> 01:05:47.455
- Well, your fucked!
- No, no, no!

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.343
Come fucked her!

01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:50.908
- Come here!
- Earl!

01:05:51.037 --> 01:05:52.792
- No!
- Get off me!

01:05:53.687 --> 01:05:55.336
Are you fucking crazy?

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:56.928
Earl, sit down!

01:05:57.648 --> 01:05:59.312
According to the German constitution
,

01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:01.185
I can not participate in active combat,

01:06:01.268 --> 01:06:03.501
can only be an observer or peacemaker.

01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:05.095
Look what you are doing?

01:06:08.938 --> 01:06:11.609
Your Children?
What's going on?

01:06:12.654 --> 01:06:14.981
Get out!
Get out, now!

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:17.084
We are discussing something.

01:06:20.377 --> 01:06:22.579
And you boys
may fall out as well.

01:06:22.836 --> 01:06:24.405
The group ended!

01:06:36.852 --> 01:06:38.121
Cheers.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:44.808
Hey Archie, mind
if we stop at my house?

01:06:44.874 --> 01:06:46.761
Promised to say goodbye
to Pam and children.

01:06:46.827 --> 01:06:47.934
Yes, do not worry.

01:06:48.003 --> 01:06:50.470
I already told you that I think Pam
too good for you?

01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:52.520
Hey, do not leave her alone.
Never know.

01:06:52.912 --> 01:06:54.346
I believe in my good looks.

01:06:55.628 --> 01:06:59.227
I get, I get.
Is.

01:07:00.271 --> 01:07:02.537
Has many shells here.

01:07:02.605 --> 01:07:05.241
Put ​​the lot here.

01:07:05.310 --> 01:07:06.709
Hey!

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.300
- Who's that?
- Santa.

01:07:09.431 --> 01:07:11.741
- Okay.
- Santa!

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:14.347
Oh, are you okay?

01:07:14.772 --> 01:07:17.540
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, little man.

01:07:17.627 --> 01:07:18.715
Who is it?

01:07:18.779 --> 01:07:19.985
Hey.

01:07:20.084 --> 01:07:22.137
- Hi, Archie, Maureen.
- Hi, Pam.

01:07:22.231 --> 01:07:23.911
When you grow up you will be a politician?

01:07:23.961 --> 01:07:27.953
Oh Yeah, good luck in Berlin..

01:07:28.395 --> 01:07:30.800
Do not worry, your husband
blew everything will be okay.

01:07:30.901 --> 01:07:33.880
- Good luck in the exams.
- Thanks, Archie.

01:07:34.062 --> 01:07:37.046
Well, it's better we fly.
I went to say goodbye.

01:07:37.926 --> 01:07:41.483
- Come hither, come hither.
- Yes

01:07:41.652 --> 01:07:43.720
Uhmm..
All right.

01:07:43.824 --> 01:07:45.821
- Love you, Dad.
- Oh!

01:07:46.106 --> 01:07:47.973
You're in charge, right?

01:07:49.101 --> 01:07:50.416
Can we?

01:07:51.918 --> 01:07:53.217
Alright.

01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:56.506
Say goodbye to the father.
Goodbye, Daddy!

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:57.727
Goodbye!

01:07:59.830 --> 01:08:02.305
I had unconditional love for my family.

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:05.468
But I could not go back.

01:08:05.567 --> 01:08:08.950
I already told you that Pam
is too good for you?

01:08:09.146 --> 01:08:10.843
Archie continued repeating what

01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:14.137
and started to think there was a reason.

01:08:58.612 --> 01:09:00.386
Convenient!

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:06.041
We're colleagues, Simon.

01:09:06.139 --> 01:09:08.193
This seems very understandable.

01:09:09.541 --> 01:09:11.256
Well,

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:20.578
I suggest you go back...
now, if you please.

01:09:20.933 --> 01:09:23.326
And if I need a cup of sugar
in the middle of the night?

01:09:24.171 --> 01:09:27.273
I have work to do.
Goodbye.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:33.568
You know where to find me,
if you need anything.

01:09:33.904 --> 01:09:35.129
Um-hum.

01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:46.542
I felt excited.

01:09:47.051 --> 01:09:49.017
I felt nauseous.

01:09:49.573 --> 01:09:51.613
As a double agent on a spy movie.

01:09:53.662 --> 01:09:56.351
Being back in Berlin
made me feel displaced.

01:09:57.782 --> 01:10:00.291
I do not know where I belonged more.

01:10:01.365 --> 01:10:03.734
I just wanted to see Simon again.

01:10:14.335 --> 01:10:16.095
Let me look at you.

01:10:17.234 --> 01:10:20.462
- You are great.
- You too.

01:10:26.006 --> 01:10:27.755
When they built this,

01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:29.647
horses were facing west.

01:10:29.763 --> 01:10:31.410
For France and England.

01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:33.765
The Germans like to think that
are part of Europe,

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:37.449
but when the Russians came,
they divided the city

01:10:37.482 --> 01:10:41.326
and turned their horses facing
to the USSR and Poland.

01:10:41.424 --> 01:10:45.012
Then when the Russians left,
they turned the horse again.

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:47.367
Now they do not know whether
they are coming or going.

01:10:50.408 --> 01:10:51.871
I have good news.

01:10:51.936 --> 01:10:53.676
Well, I think that is good news.

01:10:54.004 --> 01:10:57.488
There is a vacancy for a cellist
in the Berlin Philharmonic

01:10:57.553 --> 01:11:00.551
and my old teacher think
I should do a test.

01:11:00.893 --> 01:11:05.048
I was invited, of course,
but still not sure.

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:08.533
Oh, you have to go.

01:11:09.318 --> 01:11:11.453
'll Never forgive yourself if not.

01:11:12.713 --> 01:11:14.796
- Seriously?
- It.

01:11:20.838 --> 01:11:22.793
I want you to take me to bed.

01:11:25.392 --> 01:11:26.759
OK.

01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.282
This time it will be fun.

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:21.271
- Do you want to meet?
- Yeah, I do.

01:12:26.087 --> 01:12:27.443
- Oh!
- Hey.

01:12:27.485 --> 01:12:28.628
What are you doing?

01:12:28.697 --> 01:12:30.305
Come on, get dressed.
Let's have a few drinks.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:31.674
No, I will not.

01:12:31.739 --> 01:12:34.151
Come!
I need company.

01:12:34.153 --> 01:12:36.447
If you have a German there piranha,
at least, should invite me.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:37.928
Now, hurry up.

01:12:38.322 --> 01:12:39.820
Who is it?

01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:44.690
Is the room service.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.744
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:13:01.445 --> 01:13:04.176
- Simon is there?
- No, he is not.

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.700
- He has company?
- Company?

01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:08.137
No, no.

01:13:08.198 --> 01:13:10.058
You want a drink?
I want a drink.

01:13:10.107 --> 01:13:12.196
Come, let's have a drink,
my guest. Come, come.

01:13:17.027 --> 01:13:18.485
What shall we drink?

01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:21.132
Well, anything that packs later.

01:13:23.538 --> 01:13:25.099
Holy shit, Pam!

01:13:25.231 --> 01:13:26.447
Hey!

01:13:27.213 --> 01:13:28.389
What are you doing here?

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.994
Well,
loved to see you too, Harry.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:34.072
Well, do not expect to see
you, because we are in Berlin.

01:13:34.299 --> 01:13:36.108
I'm here to surprise Simon.

01:13:36.148 --> 01:13:37.723
Simon?
Simon is not.

01:13:38.112 --> 01:13:39.708
- It is with Boyle.
- It. With Boyle.

01:13:39.794 --> 01:13:41.613
- Oh, I'm going up then.
- Why you...

01:13:41.615 --> 01:13:43.388
Why do not you have a drink?

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:46.378
- Uh, no, not now.
- Come have a drink.

01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:48.865
- Pam Come, come.
- No, no.

01:13:48.867 --> 01:13:51.187
- Oh! Oh!
- Uhm!

01:13:53.788 --> 01:13:56.724
- Look at you.
- Uhmm!

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:01.646
Come, Pam, only a drink.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.457
Harry, I flew halfway around the world.
I just want to freshen up.

01:14:04.544 --> 01:14:05.694
You can cool off after.

01:14:05.777 --> 01:14:07.119
We are in Berlin,
for God's sake!

01:14:07.201 --> 01:14:08.661
Look, Simon is out.

01:14:08.663 --> 01:14:10.123
I will not let you pass
the first night in Berlin

01:14:10.125 --> 01:14:11.585
Locked in a room hotel alone.

01:14:11.603 --> 01:14:13.753
Harry, is not a good time.

01:14:13.908 --> 01:14:16.024
Look, seriously.
Wait, Pam.

01:14:17.178 --> 01:14:19.908
What a beautiful coat.
Is wool?

01:14:19.981 --> 01:14:21.349
Champagne for Mr. Nicholson.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.677
- Oh!
- Ah!

01:14:23.989 --> 01:14:25.423
Probably some mistake.

01:14:25.488 --> 01:14:28.407
- Simon Nicholson, room ♪ 627?
- Yes, it is ours.

01:14:28.467 --> 01:14:31.176
Wait, let me see.
Can not be.

01:14:35.908 --> 01:14:37.693
- Ah!
- Surprise!

01:14:37.962 --> 01:14:40.814
Oh!

01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:44.367
Oh, yes, please.

01:14:45.016 --> 01:14:46.824
- Champagne, right?
- My wife.

01:14:48.771 --> 01:14:51.944
- Mr.
- Here. Oh, no. Yes

01:14:52.364 --> 01:14:55.253
Very generous.
Thanks.

01:14:55.461 --> 01:14:56.731
How do you know?

01:14:56.813 --> 01:14:57.994
Well,

01:14:58.071 --> 01:15:01.474
Archie, he is terrible
to keep secrets.

01:15:01.522 --> 01:15:03.103
Look at you.

01:15:03.219 --> 01:15:04.665
Oh!

01:15:06.105 --> 01:15:07.335
Uhhh!

01:15:08.009 --> 01:15:11.117
- Someone's happy to see me?
- Oh, yes.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.282
- I left my purse there.
- I took.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.520
Oh, and this.

01:15:23.313 --> 01:15:25.314
Can I use your bathroom, please?

01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:26.706
Make yourself at home.

01:15:31.247 --> 01:15:32.684
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:15:33.072 --> 01:15:38.769
Oh, baby, that tasty.
Oh, fuck me!

01:15:38.884 --> 01:15:41.506
Oh, my pretty!
Oh, fuck me!

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.536
Fuck me! Fuck me until my eyes bleed!

01:15:44.605 --> 01:15:48.613
Shhh!
Hey, shh. Control up

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.806
Bastard.

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:56.191
Is a married man and
that woman is his wife.

01:15:58.315 --> 01:16:00.286
So why do you have the key?

01:16:00.742 --> 01:16:05.329
Jesus Christ!
Ohh!

01:16:14.521 --> 01:16:18.156
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a run.

01:16:18.465 --> 01:16:20.452
- Now?
- It.

01:16:20.607 --> 01:16:22.133
In New Zealand it is still early.

01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:23.906
It will help me sleep.

01:16:24.593 --> 01:16:25.847
Be right back!

01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:35.327
So how is the lover?

01:16:35.835 --> 01:16:38.051
I think you probably already know.

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.524
Never had the pleasure.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:45.056
Me neither.

01:16:49.424 --> 01:16:51.897
- Katrien.
- That was a fucking mistake!

01:16:51.968 --> 01:16:53.526
What?
What?

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:01.482
- Katrien! Hey!
- Taxi!

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:02.615
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.981
How would I know that Boyle

01:17:03.983 --> 01:17:05.211
would make me a surprise.

01:17:05.307 --> 01:17:07.716
It was a surprise, you know,
I did not expect.

01:17:07.878 --> 01:17:09.117
Come, come.

01:17:09.803 --> 01:17:11.813
I was horny when you Pamela...

01:17:11.872 --> 01:17:13.908
Yeah, I heard the sound
across the wall.

01:17:14.095 --> 01:17:18.012
- It's... Please, come here...
- I do not want to talk!

01:17:18.102 --> 01:17:21.305
- I imagined being with you.
- Do not... talk to me!

01:17:33.503 --> 01:17:35.396
Hello.
Who is speaking?

01:17:35.455 --> 01:17:39.013
The Hi Katrien is, please?

01:17:39.093 --> 01:17:40.348
Who is speaking?

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:43.301
Well, I would like to talk to
Katrien.

01:17:44.091 --> 01:17:45.491
She is not...

01:17:45.657 --> 01:17:47.153
Archie?

01:17:49.424 --> 01:17:51.994
Strange, I'm trying to call the Archie

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:54.032
to wish you luck with the speech but...

01:17:54.210 --> 01:17:56.296
- nobody answers.
- Oh!

01:18:08.172 --> 01:18:09.541
PLANET IN DANGER.

01:18:09.722 --> 01:18:11.098
Oh, shit!

01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:14.772
Thank you, fellow delegates.

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.411
When we say that the sky is the limit,

01:18:17.692 --> 01:18:19.855
mean that everything is possible,

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:23.046
as if the sky had no limits.

01:18:24.153 --> 01:18:26.141
But this is not the case.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.358
If you catch a train

01:18:28.444 --> 01:18:30.184
from one side of Berlin to the other
,

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.326
you travel 50 km,
which is nothing

01:18:33.358 --> 01:18:35.220
Compared with the rest of Germany.

01:18:35.298 --> 01:18:38.280
But if those same train tracks

01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:41.520
are placed perpendicular to
the surface of the Earth,

01:18:41.611 --> 01:18:45.417
50 Km could take them to the
end of the atmospheric layer,

01:18:45.618 --> 01:18:48.787
through the ozone layer, besides
the stratosphere,

01:18:48.836 --> 01:18:51.060
and you would be on the
edge of outer space.

01:18:51.622 --> 01:18:53.581
So if outer space can be achieved

01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.147
by a train trip

01:18:55.148 --> 01:18:58.923
then the sky is very limited, in fact.

01:19:02.881 --> 01:19:04.861
You wrote that shit.

01:19:10.484 --> 01:19:13.122
If you look at the clouds on the horizon,

01:19:13.219 --> 01:19:15.718
Floating so beautiful from a distance,

01:19:15.848 --> 01:19:17.844
need to understand that
the world below them

01:19:17.934 --> 01:19:20.064
is struggling and suffering.

01:19:24.278 --> 01:19:25.843
Come, come!

01:19:26.642 --> 01:19:27.904
Come.

01:19:29.672 --> 01:19:31.578
Come, come, come!

01:19:33.837 --> 01:19:35.382
- Hello? Hi
- . Hello?

01:19:35.468 --> 01:19:36.693
Oh! Hi

01:19:38.822 --> 01:19:39.945
Hello?

01:19:41.625 --> 01:19:43.384
Hello, Simon.
Are you?

01:19:44.416 --> 01:19:45.470
Simon?

01:19:53.229 --> 01:19:54.793
Pam listen.

01:19:54.925 --> 01:19:57.043
Okay, you have a right to be angry.

01:19:57.121 --> 01:19:59.281
Do not want to talk to you
your fucked!

01:20:00.494 --> 01:20:03.125
Hi, could call a taxi to
take me to the airport.

01:20:03.219 --> 01:20:04.403
Yes.

01:20:06.211 --> 01:20:08.297
This is crazy.
Talk to me!

01:20:08.307 --> 01:20:11.081
I do not want to see you again
anymore.

01:20:11.150 --> 01:20:13.403
You know what makes me more pissed?

01:20:13.888 --> 01:20:15.366
You did not have sex with a stranger

01:20:15.527 --> 01:20:17.564
one you fucked my friends.

01:20:17.748 --> 01:20:22.961
You were so cruel.
Also was a bummer.

01:20:31.397 --> 01:20:35.398
Compared to
dry, dusty surface of the Moon

01:20:35.627 --> 01:20:38.699
Earth looks moist and alive.

01:20:40.326 --> 01:20:44.139
We should do everything possible
to keep it that way.

01:20:48.033 --> 01:20:50.073
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:20:51.050 --> 01:20:52.963
When we say that the sky is the limit,

01:20:53.024 --> 01:20:55.317
mean that anything is possible.

01:20:55.405 --> 01:20:58.036
- Oh no.
- Oh, yes.

01:20:58.187 --> 01:21:00.131
But this is not the case.

01:21:00.518 --> 01:21:02.438
He will do the same
speech again.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.307
Someone must've put two copies together.

01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:07.488
What incompetent fucked!

01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:10.617
Compared to the rest of Germany.

01:21:12.728 --> 01:21:14.975
But if those same train tracks...

01:21:15.082 --> 01:21:17.367
Ah, this guy will end up packing a
fucked collision.

01:21:22.721 --> 01:21:24.923
For God's sake, Archie,
do something!

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:26.906
Ah, I'm trying to sleep
, Maureen.

01:21:26.992 --> 01:21:28.152
What you have in mind?

01:21:28.215 --> 01:21:30.207
You are visitor
Minister of the Crown,

01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:33.292
call the Department
Diplomatic or something.

01:21:33.343 --> 01:21:35.363
Jesus Christ!

01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:40.605
What the fuck is going on here?

01:21:40.738 --> 01:21:43.499
Archie, his sexy old lecher!

01:21:43.934 --> 01:21:45.595
This man needs a drink!

01:21:45.836 --> 01:21:47.873
Heard the woman, this man
need a drink!

01:21:48.072 --> 01:21:49.688
Ah, I'm proud of you.

01:21:49.784 --> 01:21:52.697
- Hey, where is Simon?
- He's resting.

01:21:52.764 --> 01:21:54.097
Hey, excellent speech today.

01:21:54.198 --> 01:21:56.150
Serious?
I almost lost me in the middle.

01:21:56.248 --> 01:21:57.324
No, impossible.

01:21:57.389 --> 01:21:58.950
Middle Delegates seemed impatient.

01:21:59.038 --> 01:22:00.604
You were spectacular,
capitalized.

01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:02.179
Where is Maureen?

01:22:02.245 --> 01:22:03.629
Oh, she's in bed.

01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:05.361
She had a great day,
the poor thing.

01:22:05.979 --> 01:22:07.916
Gentlemen, I'm out.

01:22:08.370 --> 01:22:10.348
Ladies,
a little place for your local member.

01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:12.184
Yes.

01:22:12.702 --> 01:22:15.017
Well, tell me you speak German?

01:22:15.102 --> 01:22:17.103
Someone should put a leash on him.

01:22:17.458 --> 01:22:20.361
- I'm from Hamburg.
- Yeah, yeah, Volkswagen.

01:22:20.724 --> 01:22:26.743
It is!
I love you all!

01:22:40.366 --> 01:22:42.213
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

01:22:42.281 --> 01:22:45.210
Hey, you missed a great party.

01:22:45.670 --> 01:22:47.470
This is the story of my life.

01:22:47.572 --> 01:22:49.397
Where is Pam?

01:22:49.490 --> 01:22:52.488
Pam.
You are high.

01:22:53.793 --> 01:22:57.530
Harry, there you are.

01:22:58.570 --> 01:23:01.417
- Look at you?
- It.

01:23:02.415 --> 01:23:03.653
Look.

01:23:06.196 --> 01:23:07.491
It's over.

01:23:07.574 --> 01:23:09.713
Hey, I'm still standing.

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:12.282
Uhm... yeah.

01:23:17.643 --> 01:23:19.273
Pam know.

01:23:21.251 --> 01:23:23.086
Shit, man, I did not tell you.

01:23:23.181 --> 01:23:25.070
there!

01:23:29.762 --> 01:23:31.390
Katrien hates me.

01:23:35.664 --> 01:23:37.518
Pam also hates me.

01:23:37.931 --> 01:23:39.820
Boyle fucked my speech!

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:43.213
Is.

01:23:43.351 --> 01:23:44.884
Ah, I need...

01:23:50.249 --> 01:23:51.596
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:23:53.182 --> 01:23:55.330
Hey, what the fuck you're doing?

01:23:55.635 --> 01:23:57.104
What are you doing?
Huh?

01:23:57.296 --> 01:24:00.166
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:24:00.195 --> 01:24:01.948
- Huh?
- Ahhh!

01:24:01.951 --> 01:24:03.225
Okay, enough.

01:24:03.228 --> 01:24:04.896
Enough!
Go to bed!

01:24:04.898 --> 01:24:06.462
- I go to bed.
- Go to bed.

01:24:06.464 --> 01:24:07.924
I'll call...

01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:13.942
- Open it, motherfucker!
- Go to bed!

01:24:14.201 --> 01:24:15.895
Open, I tell you!

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:18.044
Come here.

01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.914
Hey, are you man?

01:24:21.016 --> 01:24:23.362
Hey, hey, we're both
in shit now, huh?

01:24:23.455 --> 01:24:24.681
Look.

01:24:26.842 --> 01:24:28.197
Oh, shit!

01:24:28.410 --> 01:24:30.579
- It.
- Shh.

01:24:31.885 --> 01:24:33.345
- Jesus! Fuck!
- Enters.

01:24:36.565 --> 01:24:38.326
Who fucking, through the window?

01:24:38.387 --> 01:24:40.008
Ah, the chair.

01:24:40.051 --> 01:24:42.237
Thank God, I found that someone had jumped.

01:24:43.112 --> 01:24:44.520
Fuck!

01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:49.652
What is it?

01:24:50.929 --> 01:24:52.962
Not so fast, son.

01:24:53.081 --> 01:24:55.168
Do not want a diplomatic incident we?

01:24:55.523 --> 01:24:56.836
- Give me your wallet.
- Huh?

01:24:56.919 --> 01:24:58.459
- Understand?
- Ya.

01:24:58.533 --> 01:25:00.812
Walk, walk, walk.
Gives me, Simon.

01:25:01.272 --> 01:25:02.315
Right.

01:25:02.693 --> 01:25:05.332
Put ​​the damages on my account, right?

01:25:05.464 --> 01:25:07.412
And Harry needs a new room...

01:25:07.483 --> 01:25:09.317
No, no, no.
I'm staying here, Archie.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:12.512
- Okay. Copied?
- Yes.

01:25:12.578 --> 01:25:14.371
I think we can all get some sleep now.

01:25:16.605 --> 01:25:18.169
Jesus!
Fuck!

01:25:18.476 --> 01:25:20.145
- I'm sorry.
- Get out!

01:25:25.113 --> 01:25:27.080
Ah, damn!

01:25:31.513 --> 01:25:36.148
Ah! Ahh!
Oh, yes!

01:25:36.271 --> 01:25:42.108
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

01:25:53.720 --> 01:25:55.350
Hey, sorry to wake you.

01:25:55.445 --> 01:25:57.566
Do you have clean towels?
We're done.

01:25:57.681 --> 01:25:59.190
Oh, I get it for you.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.625
And that will be something left
in your mini-bar?

01:26:04.161 --> 01:26:06.197
Our is empty.
I'll take a look.

01:26:10.679 --> 01:26:12.553
Oh, Tim!

01:26:12.973 --> 01:26:15.647
Irish Cream.
Fantastic thing, you know?

01:26:15.765 --> 01:26:17.441
I experienced in the American bar.

01:26:18.746 --> 01:26:21.631
I forgot, you've been there.

01:26:21.967 --> 01:26:25.456
Tim!
I'm alone!

01:26:25.844 --> 01:26:27.737
Jess is alone.

01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:32.493
Hey, can I ask?

01:26:32.864 --> 01:26:34.512
As those pills worked with you?

01:26:34.632 --> 01:26:36.826
- Go away.
- Okay, okay.

01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:39.592
Hey, take care, bro.

01:26:41.892 --> 01:26:42.934
Hey.

01:26:50.958 --> 01:26:52.420
Oh, fuck!

01:26:58.832 --> 01:27:00.179
Oh!

01:27:01.716 --> 01:27:03.313
How did you sleep?

01:27:04.917 --> 01:27:07.007
How do you think I slept?

01:27:07.241 --> 01:27:10.177
I think I screwed up.

01:27:12.968 --> 01:27:15.772
I received an email from Pam.

01:27:18.141 --> 01:27:21.148
She wants to separate.
Can you believe that?

01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:23.846
Who separates a man by e-mail?

01:27:24.610 --> 01:27:26.809
Luck not a torpedo.

01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:30.411
She thinks I do not love her anymore?

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:35.360
- Do you love?
- Yes, I love her.

01:27:36.845 --> 01:27:39.148
But I'm not in love with her.

01:27:43.215 --> 01:27:46.279
Here's a tip, never tell her.

01:27:46.771 --> 01:27:48.742
I am passionate about Katrien.

01:27:49.062 --> 01:27:51.645
Mount of shit, man.
For the love of God!

01:27:51.913 --> 01:27:54.000
You had your case.
Leave well.

01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:55.686
You do not understand, right?

01:27:55.763 --> 01:27:58.586
Anyway, I can not do that.

01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:01.564
I have not had...

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.036
What do you mean?

01:28:04.949 --> 01:28:08.953
Is a long story.
I did not have... you know...

01:28:09.737 --> 01:28:11.061
sex.

01:28:13.097 --> 01:28:14.368
Does not matter.

01:28:20.132 --> 01:28:22.249
I've been there, partner.

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:24.616
've Been thinking with my little head.

01:28:25.598 --> 01:28:27.691
Not worth shit.

01:28:28.962 --> 01:28:31.752
Look man, I know that
thing will mess up.

01:28:32.708 --> 01:28:35.154
And I know people will get hurt but...

01:28:36.702 --> 01:28:40.286
Harry, this may be my
last chance at happiness.

01:28:43.752 --> 01:28:45.273
Alright.

01:28:45.564 --> 01:28:47.517
If you really want good advice,

01:28:49.358 --> 01:28:51.476
go straight to the airport right now
,

01:28:51.508 --> 01:28:54.008
and catch a plane home,
and when you get there,

01:28:54.586 --> 01:28:57.600
fall to your knees and ask Pam forgiveness.

01:28:58.024 --> 01:29:00.784
Harry,
my last chance of happiness.

01:29:00.851 --> 01:29:03.010
If you ever feel like that again...

01:29:04.069 --> 01:29:07.106
Be a man, get out.

01:29:08.112 --> 01:29:09.974
- Happiness.
- Go home.

01:29:10.361 --> 01:29:11.717
- Happiness.
- Go home.

01:29:11.719 --> 01:29:12.857
Happiness.

01:30:03.010 --> 01:30:04.502
Hello?

01:30:05.668 --> 01:30:07.306
Hi, it's me.

01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:09.718
Simon, I have nothing to talk to you.

01:30:10.686 --> 01:30:12.324
Please do not call again.

01:30:35.659 --> 01:30:39.402
- What are you doing here?
- Right. Fucked up, is not.

01:30:43.283 --> 01:30:44.846
What happened?

01:30:45.372 --> 01:30:48.419
Well, things got a little crazy
after you left.

01:30:49.328 --> 01:30:54.133
I threw a chair by the window of the hotel,

01:30:55.575 --> 01:30:57.813
Boyle ruined the speech,
Pam left back,

01:30:57.815 --> 01:30:59.170
Harry did not want to talk to me again

01:30:59.172 --> 01:31:02.484
is not lost and I thank my
employment.

01:31:03.964 --> 01:31:06.606
All I know is that
wanted to see you again.

01:31:14.336 --> 01:31:15.831
I'm sorry.

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:19.440
OK.

01:33:05.688 --> 01:33:07.481
Why Pam returned?

01:33:09.044 --> 01:33:10.610
She knows.

01:33:12.243 --> 01:33:13.640
She...

01:33:15.663 --> 01:33:17.312
She knows.

01:33:19.065 --> 01:33:22.224
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:33:25.072 --> 01:33:27.236
She wants separation.

01:33:29.375 --> 01:33:30.418
Oh!

01:33:33.949 --> 01:33:35.616
This is crazy.

01:33:37.352 --> 01:33:39.557
Is a fucking crazy.

01:33:43.034 --> 01:33:45.224
Katrien, what that means to you?

01:33:45.695 --> 01:33:47.066
Because...

01:33:48.009 --> 01:33:50.541
eventually not know how to say,

01:33:50.617 --> 01:33:54.559
but if we are to be together, then
, will be what will happen.

01:33:58.956 --> 01:34:00.554
Together?

01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:08.215
Together?
Simon, I...

01:34:10.296 --> 01:34:12.153
I love you, you know that.

01:34:12.852 --> 01:34:14.683
But you love.

01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:17.944
- It was the word he used...
- No

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.615
You said you loved me...

01:34:26.348 --> 01:34:28.055
I said
"love."

01:34:33.478 --> 01:34:36.820
"love."

01:34:37.535 --> 01:34:38.764
What matters it now

01:34:38.804 --> 01:34:41.206
have a million things
I could have said or...

01:34:41.268 --> 01:34:42.717
could not have said.

01:34:43.187 --> 01:34:45.965
I mean, I was hurt and needed.

01:34:45.967 --> 01:34:52.194
And you were bored... and impatient.

01:34:55.942 --> 01:34:58.451
Oh, boy, I feel horrible.

01:35:07.837 --> 01:35:10.278
You know that does not want
the separation, Simon.

01:35:22.009 --> 01:35:23.819
I do not.

01:35:27.014 --> 01:35:28.774
Enough.

01:35:33.009 --> 01:35:34.702
Enough.

01:35:47.077 --> 01:35:49.036
You need to go home.

01:36:02.056 --> 01:36:04.851
I learned an important lesson in Germany.

01:36:05.555 --> 01:36:07.724
Unconditional love lasts forever

01:36:07.966 --> 01:36:11.276
as conditional love has a very short life.

01:36:12.318 --> 01:36:15.393
It was the longest
flight three days of my life,

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:17.076
and besides, when I got home,

01:36:17.152 --> 01:36:19.171
Pam told me she had slept with someone else

01:36:19.369 --> 01:36:21.409
and that she wanted a divorce.

01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:22.694
Tim!

01:36:23.551 --> 01:36:26.116
Hi
Not expect to see you here, bro?

01:36:26.121 --> 01:36:27.164
Is.

01:36:27.166 --> 01:36:29.366
Do not tell me that his wife
expelled him from home too?

01:36:29.775 --> 01:36:31.143
Not exactly.

01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:33.033
I just told him to get out,

01:36:33.216 --> 01:36:35.347
and now you have to go shopping.

01:36:35.474 --> 01:36:37.987
A pair of pillows,
pliers, pots and things

01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:39.933
to build a house.

01:36:40.104 --> 01:36:43.037
- It is.
- It.

01:36:44.077 --> 01:36:45.743
Same here, bro.

01:36:46.414 --> 01:36:48.160
Is a fuck of an epidemic.

01:36:48.598 --> 01:36:49.944
Look.

01:36:54.570 --> 01:36:56.427
City of Separation.

01:36:59.066 --> 01:37:01.253
City of Separation, bro.

01:37:04.923 --> 01:37:06.201
Is.

01:37:07.570 --> 01:37:11.502
Here, as I join the group of men
of you?

01:37:12.478 --> 01:37:15.293
Not The drug my wife.

01:37:15.512 --> 01:37:18.354
Only let me see the kids
on certain days of the week.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:21.484
I do not know if they
could match day, but...

01:37:22.434 --> 01:37:25.105
The group no longer exists.
I'm sorry.

01:37:28.645 --> 01:37:30.544
How are you keeping, bro?

01:37:31.394 --> 01:37:35.855
Well, one day at a time.
One day at a time.

01:37:42.861 --> 01:37:44.547
Continue, bro.

01:37:45.297 --> 01:37:46.805
Carry on.

01:37:48.779 --> 01:37:50.021
I did not dare to tell Tim

01:37:50.095 --> 01:37:53.711
felt that the greatest scoundrel century.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.680
Hid my feelings as so did Tim.

01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:05.857
- How is the apartment?
- Well small.

01:38:08.528 --> 01:38:10.733
Children do not seem to mind though.

01:38:11.219 --> 01:38:12.896
Still need to buy furniture.

01:38:13.536 --> 01:38:15.387
Mobile did not enter the agreement?

01:38:15.443 --> 01:38:16.757
Get out!

01:38:16.843 --> 01:38:18.581
What do you think is this?
Los Angeles?

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:20.829
I wanted to see you and Joanne
make one.

01:38:21.538 --> 01:38:23.076
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

01:38:23.374 --> 01:38:26.073
We would sit and we would
go carefully and calmly.

01:38:26.415 --> 01:38:28.860
In case of divorce,
Joanne would get everything

01:38:28.912 --> 01:38:30.587
including the clothes I'm wearing now.

01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:38.432
I was invited to play at
the Berlin Philharmonic,

01:38:38.625 --> 01:38:40.547
I accepted.

01:38:44.134 --> 01:38:46.250
Klaus returned to stay
closer to the children.

01:38:48.285 --> 01:38:50.389
He lives a few blocks away.

01:38:50.455 --> 01:38:52.593
We are able to share custody.

01:38:56.321 --> 01:38:59.055
He paints landscapes from distant places.

01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:02.697
He is happy.

01:39:03.978 --> 01:39:06.156
The kids are happy too.

01:39:17.048 --> 01:39:19.406
Careful, careful.
Do not over tighten.

01:39:23.829 --> 01:39:26.958
- Hey.
- How are you?

01:39:29.825 --> 01:39:32.365
- You?
- I'm good.

01:39:32.778 --> 01:39:34.158
I'm fine.

01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:41.717
I made a list of things to divide.

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.684
I'm sure that is fair.

01:39:50.648 --> 01:39:52.473
You know, for the record,

01:39:54.415 --> 01:39:56.861
no matter what happens,

01:39:57.217 --> 01:40:00.150
no matter what you feel,
does not matter what you think,

01:40:00.488 --> 01:40:02.883
I love you.

01:40:05.437 --> 01:40:07.645
I think you pretty incredible.

01:40:08.745 --> 01:40:11.256
And I regret not having shown enough.

01:40:12.615 --> 01:40:16.118
I could, I should, and did not.

01:40:17.507 --> 01:40:19.123
I'm sorry.

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:21.951
I who should apologize.

01:40:22.195 --> 01:40:26.723
Not Enough blame.

01:40:27.635 --> 01:40:30.333
Daddy, Daddy, I
four crabs for you.

01:40:30.934 --> 01:40:31.977
Oh!

01:40:32.087 --> 01:40:35.726
Oh, now I only have three
crabs for you.

01:40:36.099 --> 01:40:39.692
Let me take a look.
Look! Is not that fantastic?

01:40:41.567 --> 01:40:43.961
You take care of them for me, right?

01:40:44.570 --> 01:40:46.261
Need to have a talk with Mom.

01:40:46.338 --> 01:40:47.924
- Come here.
- Sure.

01:40:48.025 --> 01:40:49.369
Gives me a hug.

01:41:10.628 --> 01:41:12.276
You should read it.

01:41:13.469 --> 01:41:15.457
No, okay.
I trust you.

01:41:15.714 --> 01:41:19.074
- Seriously?
- Completely.

01:41:21.984 --> 01:41:23.799
Must be a lovely feeling.

01:41:27.883 --> 01:41:29.057
Come here.

01:41:32.300 --> 01:41:34.560
Pam and I used to think were the only ones.

01:41:34.779 --> 01:41:37.019
But now we know that we
belong to the graph,

01:41:37.168 --> 01:41:39.015
Like everyone else.

01:41:40.419 --> 01:41:42.901
We might bother us with our infidelities.

01:41:44.110 --> 01:41:45.998
She did not tell me he slept with
,

01:41:46.064 --> 01:41:48.476
only that it was a fantastic lover.

01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:50.953
As if I needed to know.

01:42:02.952 --> 01:42:05.050
Pam went to bed with Klaus.

01:42:05.508 --> 01:42:07.721
Perhaps this has helped to
to forgive Simon.

01:42:08.715 --> 01:42:11.468
They are together again,
which is good.

01:42:12.801 --> 01:42:15.117
I do not expect she'll forgive me.

01:42:16.975 --> 01:42:19.124
I think of Simon
from time to time.

01:42:20.981 --> 01:42:23.349
I wonder if he thinks about me.

01:42:27.759 --> 01:42:29.908
Love is an undulating sea

01:42:30.267 --> 01:42:34.528
is time that water moves away,
leaving it aside,

01:42:37.029 --> 01:42:39.672
Then
you have to be strong and patient

01:42:40.791 --> 01:42:45.306
and wait for the moon and stars
work the magic again.
