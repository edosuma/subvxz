00:01.569 --> 00:03.371
ADULT ADAM: Back in the '80s,
the biggest night
for any bride,

00:03.437 --> 00:05.939
besides the wedding,
was the bachelorette party.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.708
Lashes were curled,
hair was crimped,

00:07.775 --> 00:09.377
sashes were sashed...

00:09.443 --> 00:12.313
All to make it a night
that the bride-to-be
would never forget.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.682
Guys, it's so sweet you went
to all this trouble for me.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.250
Really? 'Cause you said
if we didn't,

00:16.317 --> 00:17.751
you'd "never forgive us."

00:17.818 --> 00:20.221
And then you said, "If you're
going to go to the trouble,

00:20.288 --> 00:22.556
do everything I say."
Still, so sweet.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.991
We totally went all-out.

00:24.058 --> 00:28.129
I even packed us a naughty bag
of bachelorette nastiness.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.263
Check it out,
girlfriend.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.065
Oh, n-n-n-never!

00:31.132 --> 00:32.700
Bar, you need to chill.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.902
All we're doing
is going for a little fondue

00:34.968 --> 00:36.003
and a lot of karaoke.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.439
Where there's music,
there's dancing.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.974
Will there be dancing
in a group setting?
Someone tell me.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.076
What's happening?

00:42.143 --> 00:45.113
As bridesmaids,
you are legally obligated

00:45.179 --> 00:48.282
to form
a protective dance wall
around the bride-to-be.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.451
I thought our job was to,
like, catch the bouquet

00:50.518 --> 00:51.852
and hook up with
a random hot cousin.

00:51.919 --> 00:55.123
Wrong! Now, everyone fall into
anti-grinding formation.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.324
Let's practice.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.660
Hey, I'm a local townie
looking for a good grind.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.630
Uh-oh. They're playing
"Safety Dance."

01:02.696 --> 01:04.098
But this is not safe.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.433
Honestly,
it's going to be fine.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.201
Then you leave me
no choice.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.969
Attention!

01:09.036 --> 01:11.939
I shall throw my own
wild bachelor party.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.507
Cool.
Really?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.742
I trust you.
Well, you shouldn't.2

01:14.808 --> 01:17.010
You should. You're never
gonna do better anyway.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.613
Agreed.
Time to go tell
my best man

01:19.680 --> 01:22.015
to plan a gnarly
bachelor party

01:22.082 --> 01:23.351
and also
pick my best man.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.386
**

01:25.453 --> 01:27.788
Adam, it's recently
come to my attention

01:27.855 --> 01:29.957
that I need a best man,
and I've made my choice.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.225
Naked Rob, right?

01:31.292 --> 01:32.793
He's the heart and soul
of the JTP.

01:32.860 --> 01:33.861
No, dummy.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.529
It's you,
'cause you're my brother

01:35.596 --> 01:37.631
and you mean
the stupid world to me.

01:37.698 --> 01:39.333
What?
Stop.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.001
Don't make this
all weird and tearful.

01:41.068 --> 01:44.305
I-I just can't help it.
It's just such
a wonderful moment for us.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.006
No! Don't you dare
feel deep emotion,

01:46.073 --> 01:47.308
'cause then
I'll feel it, too!

01:47.375 --> 01:48.376
I just...

01:48.442 --> 01:51.011
I have a brother
who loves me so much.

01:51.078 --> 01:52.480
It's true.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.047
We gotta do
man stuff fast.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.149
We can battle
on my official

01:55.216 --> 01:57.084
"Over the Top"
arm-wrestling table.

01:57.151 --> 01:59.320
I'm gonna
break all the little bones
in your little bird hand.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.522
Do it. Right now.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.991
Be Stallone.
Go over the top
and pin my arm.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.559
Oh, no!

02:05.626 --> 02:08.229
Now we're just holding
hands and staring into
each other's teary eyes.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.498
Your fingers are
so gently entangled in mine.

02:10.564 --> 02:13.367
It's like you're
my missing puzzle piece!

02:13.434 --> 02:15.403
I don't know where I stop
and where you begin!

02:15.469 --> 02:16.870
No!

02:16.937 --> 02:19.740
If you cry tears of love,
then I'll cry tears of love.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.243
Oh, no! I hear crying.
I've got my first-aid kit.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.344
What's wrong?

02:23.411 --> 02:25.546
Barry asked me
to be his best man!

02:25.613 --> 02:26.847
Oh, sweet God, no.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.382
I love this boy.

02:28.449 --> 02:30.584
I need to hug you both
as tight as I can right now.

02:30.651 --> 02:31.819
Hold me in your arms.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.156
* I'm twisted up inside

02:36.224 --> 02:39.893
* But nonetheless,
I feel the need to say

02:42.230 --> 02:43.697
* I don't know the future

02:43.764 --> 02:47.301
* But the past keeps getting
clearer every day *

02:47.368 --> 02:49.203
ADULT ADAM:
It was December 5th,
1980-something,

02:49.270 --> 02:51.104
and my mom was
dropping us off at school

02:51.171 --> 02:52.773
in my dad's crappy old car.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.308
At least, she was trying to.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.310
Goldbergs, you're up.
Unlock and unload.

02:56.377 --> 02:57.645
Mwah, mwah. Go.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.013
Be the amazing, delicious boys
I birthed you to be.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.315
Damn it!

03:01.382 --> 03:03.251
You know this door
doesn't open from the inside.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.418
You gotta get out
and open it.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.720
Goldberg, Goldfarb,
let's hurry it up.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.589
Damn it, just get out
on Adam's side.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.124
The door's bungee-d shut

03:11.191 --> 03:13.060
'cause Dad slammed it too hard
after the Eagles lost.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.895
Oh, poop!

03:14.962 --> 03:16.196
No, you don't get out.
They get out.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.131
If I don't get out,
they can't get out.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.868
I'm sorry. I had to take
Murray's car today.

03:20.934 --> 03:21.935
I don't need your backstory,

03:22.002 --> 03:24.204
Norman Mailer.
Just get 'em out.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.240
Damn it, Murray!
All right,
we got a two-minute limit.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.309
You're gonna have to
circle back around. Next!

03:28.376 --> 03:29.510
I am not getting back

03:29.577 --> 03:31.111
in that line.
Look at how long it is.

03:31.178 --> 03:32.880
It's that long
because of you!

03:32.946 --> 03:33.981
Mom, let us out!

03:34.047 --> 03:35.249
Boys, just climb out
the window.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.217
Go, go, go!

03:37.285 --> 03:39.086
Oh, Schmoopie, no!
Don't go headfirst!

03:39.152 --> 03:40.688
I gotta see
what I'm landing on.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.122
I don't want to get
a gravel rash.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.891
All right, this circus act
is unacceptable.

03:43.957 --> 03:45.793
Oh, no! My glasses!

03:45.859 --> 03:47.461
Forget 'em.
You got four other senses.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.896
Wait.
My Toaster Strudel.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.298
I'll drop it off
later.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.132
It's fine. I'll just
"Dukes of Hazzard" it.

03:52.199 --> 03:55.269
Oh, Barry, no. Do not
"Dukes of Hazzard" the window.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.337
Too late!

03:57.505 --> 03:59.307
You need a new car.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.674
Ah, again with this?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.843
My car works just fine.
Tell her, Bill.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.077
This kind of feels like

04:04.144 --> 04:05.379
one of those
lose-lose situations

04:05.446 --> 04:06.647
I'd rather not
be involved in.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.081
Too late.
You're going with us.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.483
You're gonna be
a bad influence

04:09.550 --> 04:11.352
and goad him
into spending some money.

04:11.419 --> 04:13.287
How about this?
We compromise.

04:13.354 --> 04:16.424
I replace the door handle,
and boom! Everybody wins!

04:16.490 --> 04:17.825
Forget the door handle.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.192
You've been driving
the same car

04:19.259 --> 04:20.661
since our first date.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.363
So it's got sentimental value.
You get it.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.565
You're getting a new car.

04:24.632 --> 04:29.903
**

04:29.970 --> 04:31.271
Hey!

04:31.339 --> 04:33.140
Time to talk bachelor party,
best man.

04:33.206 --> 04:35.976
Last night, I taped
a movie off Cinemax

04:36.043 --> 04:37.110
starring Tom Hanks,

04:37.177 --> 04:39.112
that forever
changed my life...

04:39.179 --> 04:40.247
"Bachelor Party."

04:40.314 --> 04:42.450
My dad said that movie
was a raunchy shlockfest

04:42.516 --> 04:44.017
that celebrates
the lowest form of comedy.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.319
Your dad knows his stuff.

04:45.386 --> 04:48.055
It is brilliant, and I want it
to be the blueprint

04:48.121 --> 04:49.823
for my zany bachelor party.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.659
What exactly do you mean
by "zany"?

04:51.725 --> 04:55.028
I'm talking about
a giant rager in a hotel suite

04:55.095 --> 04:56.530
with sketchy babes,

04:56.597 --> 04:58.499
unruly Japanese businessmen,

04:58.566 --> 05:01.168
and a beer-guzzling mule
that passes out.

05:01.234 --> 05:03.571
That sounds very adult.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.772
Exactly!

05:04.838 --> 05:06.707
Everyone's saying
I'm just a dumb kid

05:06.774 --> 05:08.208
who's stupidly
getting married.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.611
But this party will prove
I'm a dumb adult

05:10.678 --> 05:11.712
who's stupidly
getting married.

05:11.779 --> 05:12.880
That logic kind of tracks.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.348
Thank you,
David Kimberly.

05:14.415 --> 05:16.049
You think "Kim" is short
for "Kimberly"?

05:16.116 --> 05:17.184
I'm certain of it.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.786
Get to party planning, boys.

05:18.852 --> 05:21.154
No pressure, but my whole
marriage depends on it.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.890
Don't worry.
I will not rest

05:22.956 --> 05:26.494
till I throw you the bachelor
party in "Bachelor Party."

05:29.930 --> 05:32.366
You can't throw him
this bachelor party
in this movie, man.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.435
You can't do it.
I know, Dave Kim.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.104
There's so much bad language
and full-frontal shenanigans.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.572
I know, Dave Kim!

05:38.639 --> 05:40.408
Why would
boyishly lovable Tom Hanks

05:40.474 --> 05:41.542
agree to be in this?

05:41.609 --> 05:43.210
He's done.
He'll never work again.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.112
I know, Dave Kim!

05:45.178 --> 05:47.180
Barry said his marriage
hinges on this!

05:47.247 --> 05:49.517
What are you
gonna do, bro?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.985
I don't know, Dave Kim.
I don't know.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.521
ADULT ADAM: That day,
the only thing harder

05:53.587 --> 05:55.255
than throwing Barry
a bachelor party

05:55.322 --> 05:56.990
was getting my dad
to buy a new car.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.627
Howdy, folks. Welcome
to Calabasas Family Auto.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.796
Hey, I'm gonna kick things off
with a friendly ice breaker.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.131
Are any of you guys cops?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.933
No?
Perfect!

06:05.999 --> 06:07.601
Hey, this handsome
young guy looks like

06:07.668 --> 06:09.437
he's looking for something
sporty, right?

06:09.503 --> 06:11.071
Not even a little.
Okay.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.140
Please don't touch me.
Sounds like a plan.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.608
Actually,
I dragged him here.

06:14.675 --> 06:15.809
He needs a new car.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.645
Well, I can tell
just from the look of you

06:17.711 --> 06:20.013
that you only settle
for the best.
Am I right?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.148
You are not.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.750
Save your spiel
for the other suckers.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.917
I'm just here
for a new handle.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.253
Murray, look at me
and hear the words

06:26.319 --> 06:28.689
of a woman who was
banned from carpool.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.057
You're getting a car today.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.125
Any car. I don't even care
what it is at this point.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.161
My God, Mur-man!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.663
You're such
a cheap bastard,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.831
your wife has
completely given up

06:37.898 --> 06:39.933
and letting you get
whatever car you like.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.402
No, no. Now, let's respect
your sensible pal

06:42.470 --> 06:43.971
and his sensible choices.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.874
Allow me to show you
to our finest door handles,

06:46.940 --> 06:49.409
which are just past
the luxury sports cars.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.478
Don't let them seduce you.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.880
Ah, let me make this easy
on you, okay?

06:52.946 --> 06:54.782
No, no, no...

06:54.848 --> 06:56.650
Never.

06:56.717 --> 06:59.052
ADULT ADAM: In that moment,
my dad would ask a question

06:59.119 --> 07:01.021
that would change
the course of history.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.422
What's that?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.357
That, my friend,
is the "Bitter."

07:04.424 --> 07:06.594
It's Austrian.
So very rare.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.630
Kind of looks like a Ferrari.
I really loved those as a kid.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.364
Come on, Murray.
For once in your life,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.600
just treat yourself.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.867
And what a treat!

07:13.934 --> 07:17.037
Hey, Mur!
Individual seat heaters!

07:17.104 --> 07:19.607
You know what they call that?
"The marriage saver."

07:19.673 --> 07:21.241
Maybe if I had
these bun toasters,

07:21.308 --> 07:23.511
I'd still be married.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.778
Who am I kidding?

07:24.845 --> 07:27.881
We had separate bedrooms,
only said hi in the hallway.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.316
But come on!

07:29.382 --> 07:30.984
Ah,  it!

07:31.051 --> 07:33.153
Aw, don't let your sad pal
sell you

07:33.220 --> 07:35.088
on this marvel
of modern engineering

07:35.155 --> 07:39.159
that happens to go
from zero to 60
in only 8.1 seconds flat.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.360
That is fast.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.029
That's because
there's a V-6 engine

07:42.095 --> 07:43.731
and 210 horses
under the hood.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.899
That's a lot of ponies
running wild.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.902
I call 'em ponies, too,
and nobody ever gets that.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.904
I'm starting to think that
this thing is meant to be.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.105
She is a beauty.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.007
So

07:54.074 --> 07:55.643
Do we have ourselves
a sale?

07:55.709 --> 07:56.810
Here's the thing.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.378
I'm a simple man.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.047
I-I don't need
fancy things.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.282
I just need, uh...

08:02.349 --> 08:04.084
A new door handle.
Fine.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.285
Follow me to Parts.

08:05.352 --> 08:06.386
So close.

08:06.453 --> 08:07.888
Disappointed!

08:07.955 --> 08:10.524
ADULT ADAM: And so, my dad's
car troubles were over.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.561
Little did he know, my mom
was about to switch gears.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.829
**

08:15.896 --> 08:17.097
Morning, sunshine.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.566
What the hell did you do?

08:18.632 --> 08:20.200
You may refuse
to treat yourself,

08:20.267 --> 08:21.769
but I can still
treat you.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.871
Oh, you should see
the look on your face.

08:23.937 --> 08:24.938
Seriously...

08:25.005 --> 08:26.439
Hey, don't shut
the door on me.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.976
It's the Ferrari
of Austria, Murray!

08:29.843 --> 08:31.912
Lose yourself
in luxury!

08:31.979 --> 08:33.981
Damn, Murray,
take the car!

08:35.348 --> 08:36.784
BARRY: Okay, best man.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.319
Take us through my epic
adult-man bachelor party.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.954
ALL:
Adult-man bachelor party!

08:41.021 --> 08:42.690
Strap yourselves in, boys.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.958
First, we kick it off
at the Willow Grove Mall

08:45.025 --> 08:48.796
with a fun night
of Skee-Ball and more
at Challenges Arcade.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.997
Question.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.700
Does the "more" include
nudity and/or keg stands?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.401
ALL:
Nudity and/or keg stands!

08:54.467 --> 08:55.836
It does not.

08:55.903 --> 08:59.239
But it does include
unlimited tokens, air hockey,

08:59.306 --> 09:02.976
and a private party room
featuring a Cookie Puss cake.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.746
Question.
In this said
private party room,

09:05.813 --> 09:07.815
will there also be
a stolen Porsche

09:07.881 --> 09:09.583
and/or a drunk donkey?

09:09.650 --> 09:11.084
ALL:
And/or drunk donkey!

09:11.151 --> 09:12.886
No.
But fear not,

09:12.953 --> 09:15.656
'cause I did book us
a mini-horse

09:15.723 --> 09:19.459
that we can pet and be like,
"Look! A mini-horse."

09:19.526 --> 09:22.562
Dude!
I asked for a crazy rager
fit for men.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.665
You're just throwing me
a lame kid's birthday party.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.634
Maybe that's 'cause
I am a kid.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.769
Then I hereby fire you
as best man

09:28.836 --> 09:30.503
and demote you
to regular man.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.172
No. Please don't make me
just regular.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.041
JTP, you're
my new best man.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.142
ALL: New best man!

09:35.208 --> 09:37.477
Adam, vacate
the presenting area.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.579
Let's hear it, boys.
What do you got?

09:39.647 --> 09:42.783
Bro, if you want
an adult-man bachelor party,

09:42.850 --> 09:45.318
then we are gonna
go extreme!

09:45.385 --> 09:47.955
I say we kick off the night
in a badass arcade

09:48.021 --> 09:49.757
with some high-octane
Skee-Ball!

09:49.823 --> 09:51.625
High-octane.
Now we're talking.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.127
Followed by some extreme
arcade gameplay,

09:54.194 --> 09:56.563
totally balls out
and wild!

09:56.630 --> 09:59.232
That is balls out.
You guys just get it.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.635
Then we kick it up to the max
with a monster mini-horse

10:01.702 --> 10:02.970
and a no-holds-barred cake

10:03.036 --> 10:04.705
made of insanely cold
ice cream!

10:04.772 --> 10:06.674
This is insane.
All of it.

10:06.740 --> 10:10.110
Dude!
They just said
the exact same stuff as me,

10:10.177 --> 10:12.545
only they're shouting
and using fancier adjectives.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.347
Sorry. Nailed.
Yeah.
We're kids, too.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.949
Fine!
Adam's best man again.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.150
ANDY: No!
Damn it!

10:17.217 --> 10:18.518
Dude, this is an emotional
roller coaster.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.154
How hard is it to throw me
a gnarly bachelor party

10:21.221 --> 10:23.590
that proves I'm a gnarly adult
ready for marriage?

10:23.657 --> 10:26.526
Honestly, none of us can
throw you that kind of party.

10:26.593 --> 10:30.330
But lucky for you,
I know a guy
who specializes in gnarly.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.899
ADULT ADAM:
And that guy was none other

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
than our party animal uncle,

10:33.500 --> 10:34.902
Marvin Goldberg.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.338
I heard somebody's
in the market
for a gnarly bachelor party.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.408
Now, tell me,
on a scale from 1 to 10,

10:41.474 --> 10:42.743
how gnarly?

10:42.810 --> 10:44.077
Six?
Eight.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.213
I heard six and eight.
That's 14.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.915
Out of my way, boys!

10:47.981 --> 10:50.918
ADULT ADAM: Turns out,
it was gonna be
a big, gnarly mistake.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.286
ADULT ADAM: Even though my mom
treated my dad
to a new Bitter,

10:53.353 --> 10:55.622
it just made him
more bitter than ever.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.225
I mean it, Bevy.
I'm returning that damn car.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.294
The last thing I need
is the Ferrari of Austria.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.395
Sure you do.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.064
Those people make
a quality product.

11:04.131 --> 11:07.267
They gave us the boomerang
and Crocodile Dundee.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.269
It's Austria,
not Australia.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.439
My God. Just...let me
handle this, okay?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.842
Murray, please.
Just take the Bitter
for a spin.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.244
Look! I got you
driving gloves.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.446
I don't want to wear gloves
while I drive.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.914
What am I?
The Equalizer?

11:20.981 --> 11:24.284
Come on, Murray.
Sporty new gloves
for your sporty new car.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.385
Just drive the thing.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.553
Oh, I'll drive the thing.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.856
Right back to that
shyster's car lot.

11:28.922 --> 11:31.491
ADULT ADAM: At least, that was
my dad's plan...

11:31.558 --> 11:32.793
...until this happened.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.795
What?
Like the car.
What is it?

11:34.862 --> 11:36.764
It's a Bitter.
Never seen one.
Where's it from?

11:36.830 --> 11:38.331
Austria. Very rare.

11:38.398 --> 11:39.767
Kind of looks
like a Ferrari.

11:39.833 --> 11:40.868
Love those cars.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.202
Yeah, Ferraris are okay.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.470
Yeah.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.405
Well, thanks for letting me
look at it.

11:45.472 --> 11:48.942
ADULT ADAM:
Yep. That first car compliment
made my dad feel pretty good.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.678
And by the tenth,
he was riding high.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.747
Hey.
What kind of car?

11:53.814 --> 11:54.948
Uh, it's a Bitter.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.516
Austrian. Very rare.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.650
At first, I thought
it was a...

11:57.717 --> 12:00.253
Oh, Ferrari. Yeah.
It gets that a lot.

12:00.320 --> 12:04.057
Also, Austria isn't the place
with the boxing kangaroos.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.793
That's Australia.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.928
See?
I'm growing, too.

12:07.995 --> 12:09.930
You know, it's funny.
When I drive it,

12:09.997 --> 12:11.932
I feel like I'm standing out,

12:11.999 --> 12:13.433
but not in a bad way.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.268
Murray,
do you feel special?

12:15.335 --> 12:18.705
Yeah. I-I guess.
I-I do feel special.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.973
You are special,

12:20.040 --> 12:22.910
and for once in your life,
you deserve special things.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.345
Ah, screw it!
I'm a Bitter man now.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.280
ADULT ADAM:
Yep, that crazy foreign car

12:27.347 --> 12:29.149
made something
even crazier happen,

12:29.216 --> 12:32.019
It made my dad start
to embrace feeling special...

12:32.085 --> 12:33.887
...for about 10 seconds.

12:45.232 --> 12:50.103
Gentlemen, thanks for coming
to Barry's bachelor party.

12:51.571 --> 12:55.108
Adam, cue
the mind-blowing visuals!

12:56.743 --> 12:59.712
MARVIN:
Philadelphia,
known for the Liberty Bell,

12:59.779 --> 13:00.814
South Street,

13:00.881 --> 13:02.916
and the world's
greatest cheesesteaks.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.753
But tonight, none of that
matters, not one damn bit.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.021
What?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.456
But you made me
go around the city

13:09.522 --> 13:10.757
taking photos
of that stuff.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.459
It's for dramatic effect, man.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.928
Which I achieved.

13:14.995 --> 13:19.132
Because tonight, there's only
one landmark that matters,

13:19.199 --> 13:21.869
Delaware County's
wildest dance club,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.937
Pulsations!

13:26.606 --> 13:29.943
We're talking
6,000-square-foot
dance floor,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.744
wall-to-wall babes,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.847
lasers, smoke machines,

13:33.914 --> 13:36.783
giant speakers that guarantee
permanent hearing loss,

13:36.850 --> 13:41.221
and a sentient party robot
that came to get down.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.190
Seriously?
They have a party robot?

13:43.256 --> 13:44.757
Little fun fact,

13:44.824 --> 13:47.527
it's the same robot
they cast in "Rocky IV"
as Paulie's robo-butler.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.529
ALL: Ooh!

13:49.596 --> 13:52.632
And now, in your envelopes
you will find,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.801
Binaca spray,
Mexican pesos,

13:54.868 --> 13:57.237
anti-venom,
and fake I.D.s.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.908
Sweet! I'm a 65-year-old
organ donor
named Enzo Pinetti.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.409
GEOFF: George P. Shultz?

14:02.475 --> 14:04.244
Isn't he,
like, Secretary of State?

14:04.311 --> 14:05.812
Yeah, maybe you want
to tuck your shirt in.

14:05.879 --> 14:08.916
Philippe Tallahassee?
Sounds totally made up, bro.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.451
Not as made up as
Abner Q. Cheeseburger.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.386
Of German descent.
It's perfectly plausible.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.755
Yeah, okay. This whole night
sounds a little intense.

14:15.822 --> 14:17.790
Trust me, Cheeseburger.
You'll be fine.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.993
If not, the safeword
is "apricot."

14:20.060 --> 14:22.129
Thanks, but no thanks.
I'm going home.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.232
Guys, this terrifying
journey to adulthood

14:25.298 --> 14:27.067
is exactly what I need.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.936
Just like Tom Hanks
in "Bachelor Party,"

14:29.002 --> 14:31.071
this will finally
get me ready for marriage.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.839
Now we're starting
to make some good decisions.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.942
Okay, now let's go over
what to expect

14:35.008 --> 14:37.978
in the VIP room at
Pulsations!
BARRY: Yes!

14:39.812 --> 14:42.049
Apricot! Apricot!
Help! What? N-No!

14:44.017 --> 14:45.485
Yeah, this thing's
never driving again.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.787
Never?
Like never ever?

14:47.854 --> 14:49.957
Yeah. Not sure
if you know this.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.592
This is a Bitter.
Austrian, very rare.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.394
Yeah. We're aware.

14:54.461 --> 14:55.929
Can't you just fix it?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.130
Well, I mean,
here's the thing.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.631
If you have a car
there's only one of,

14:58.698 --> 15:00.133
I mean, it ain't easy
to get parts.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.569
There's legitimately none
in this country.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.272
So,
what you're saying is,

15:05.338 --> 15:08.608
I splurged
on something nice
for myself,

15:08.675 --> 15:11.844
and the very next day,
it's broken forever?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.646
Yeah, that's
exactly the case.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.982
Your fault!
No,

15:15.048 --> 15:16.984
I saw the way you were
looking at the Bitter.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.585
You wanted the Bitter.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.453
You're a Bitter man,
remember?

15:20.520 --> 15:21.721
I am a bitter man.

15:21.788 --> 15:24.757
I'm bitter to have
a broken car in my driveway

15:24.824 --> 15:26.659
mocking me
for the rest of my life.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.195
Angry!

15:28.261 --> 15:30.197
ADULT ADAM: While my dad
was accepting his fate,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.532
Barry was ready
for his destiny.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.834
Dude!
Where are you going?

16:41.901 --> 16:43.370
Anywhere but here.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.838
But I gave you
exactly what you wanted.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.407
I...

16:47.474 --> 16:49.909
I thought
I wanted it, but...

16:49.976 --> 16:52.745
All it made me realize is,
I'm not ready for any of it.

16:52.812 --> 16:58.251
**

16:58.318 --> 16:59.619
ADULT ADAM:
After the Bitter had broken,

16:59.686 --> 17:02.055
it left my dad
bitter and broken.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.456
Can you believe
that woman?

17:03.523 --> 17:04.857
"Treat yourself, Mur."

17:04.924 --> 17:06.959
Who says that
to a husband

17:07.026 --> 17:09.162
Dear Lord!
This is so infuriating,

17:09.229 --> 17:10.997
it makes me wanna
punch a wall.

17:11.064 --> 17:13.533
Aw, pal, I really
appreciate the support.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.569
Wait, you think
I'm on your side?
Aren't you?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.406
No! You make me want
to punch a wall, not her!

17:19.472 --> 17:20.973
You're my best friend.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.176
You're supposed to blindly
agree with anything I say.
No.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.245
Beverly is a saint.

17:25.312 --> 17:28.115
Last I heard,
my wife is somewhere
in the Southwest.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.118
That's not even a state.
That's just a region
of the country.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.785
I can't get her
on the phone.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.621
There's not even
an area code.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.324
I ate a banana for dinner
three times last week.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.892
When I don't brush my teeth,
nobody cares.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.027
We all got stuff.

17:41.094 --> 17:42.262
Not you.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.897
Your wife cooks for you,
she appreciates you,

17:44.964 --> 17:46.466
she wants you to be happy.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.835
My wife is a ghost
in the wind.

17:48.901 --> 17:53.005
Sometimes I talk
to an old sock of hers
when I feel lonely.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.376
So, you're not gonna
side with me on this, are you?

17:56.443 --> 17:57.644
Hell no!

17:57.710 --> 17:59.679
And you're gonna
make this right for us.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.181
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:01.248 --> 18:04.217
I'm gonna go home
and peel my dinner.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.786
ADULT ADAM: It finally
dawned on my dad.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.021
He had a wife who would do
anything to make him happy.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.824
As for my brother,
when it came to marriage,

18:11.891 --> 18:13.960
he didn't know what to feel.
(THE CARS'
JUST WHAT I NEEDED PLAYING)

18:14.026 --> 18:15.995
Got you some Cookie Puss,
buddy.

18:16.062 --> 18:17.464
Forget it.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.199
Party's over, dude.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.667
Look.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.403
* 'Cause when you're standing
oh so near

18:23.470 --> 18:25.705
You may have hated
your adult party,

18:25.772 --> 18:28.175
but that doesn't mean
you're not ready
to be an adult.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.509
Of course it does.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.044
I mean, look at me.
I haven't grown up at all.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.148
Well, I may be
the least mature human
on the planet,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.849
but the one thing I know

18:36.916 --> 18:39.352
is that the way you love
and treat Lainey,

18:39.419 --> 18:41.087
that's as grown-up
as it gets.

18:42.088 --> 18:44.557
Thanks, Ad Rock.
Means a lot.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.327
Just doing my job
as best man.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.662
You're more
than my best man.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.964
You're the best brother
a guy could ask for.

18:52.031 --> 18:55.168
Come on!
We agreed no feelings
or crying or hugging.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.736
No, seriously.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.607
You really did throw me
the bachelor party
of my dreams.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.342
Even if it was
a total nightmare.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.744
Well,
it doesn't have to be.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.414
Come on.
The bachelor party's over.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.183
Didn't you learn anything
from Tom Hanks?

19:10.250 --> 19:12.319
The party's over
when we say it is.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.755
* I guess you're
just what I needed

19:15.822 --> 19:17.624
ADULT ADAM:
So, at the end of the day,

19:17.690 --> 19:20.627
Barry never got
the wild bachelor party
he thought he wanted.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.863
Instead, he got a night
he'd never forget.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.365
'Cause the truth is,

19:25.432 --> 19:27.400
just when you think you're
ready for the next level,

19:27.467 --> 19:30.937
it's okay to just
be in the moment
and have a little fun.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.939
Sure, that might not
be right for everyone,

19:33.005 --> 19:35.275
but for my brother,
it was just what he needed.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.010
* I guess you're
just what I needed
Just what I needed

19:38.077 --> 19:40.647
Uh, I-I hope you don't mind.
I need to use the car.

19:40.713 --> 19:42.482
Sorry. I gotta
make the returns.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.850
You also,

19:45.785 --> 19:47.554
didn't get to go
on a picnic.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.888
Murray,
what are you doing?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.491
I'm just trying to
make things right with us.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.326
And Bill.
Uh, don't ask.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.562
But why? You were right.
It was my fault.

19:55.628 --> 19:57.330
I'm the one
who forced you into the car,

19:57.397 --> 19:58.965
thinking it would
make you happy.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.267
Look.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.870
I don't need nice things
to be happy.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.573
I've already got the nicest
thing in the world.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.640
You.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.343
Aw, Mur.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.112
ADULT ADAM:
Yeah, my mom and dad may not
have always seen eye-to-eye,

20:13.179 --> 20:14.647
but what really mattered

20:14.714 --> 20:17.149
was that they had
each other's backs.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.418
That's the thing
about the people

20:18.485 --> 20:19.986
we choose to spend
our life with.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.589
In the end,
they're all we need to get by.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.425
And, when it came to
that busted-down Bitter,

20:25.492 --> 20:27.894
it really did sit
in our driveway forever.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.061
But it didn't matter,

20:29.128 --> 20:30.930
because every time
my dad saw it,

20:30.997 --> 20:33.700
he was reminded
that he already had
the greatest gift of all,

20:33.766 --> 20:36.068
a person
to spend his life with.

20:37.770 --> 20:44.611
**

20:44.677 --> 20:51.951
**

20:52.018 --> 20:54.153
Off-campus lunch
is a go, boys.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.622
We've got 36 minutes

20:55.688 --> 20:57.857
to make it
to Jim's Steaks and back.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.225
Let's ride.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.528
Wait. I thought your dad
sold his crappy old Tercel.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.796
He bought it back
'cause his new sports car

21:03.863 --> 21:05.865
was even crappier
than this crap box.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.134
Uh, bro,
the door won't open.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.269
That's 'cause it's been
permanently busted.

21:10.337 --> 21:11.638
You just got to
Dukes of Hazzard it.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.172
ALL: Ooh!

21:13.239 --> 21:14.641
Need more of a head start.

21:16.208 --> 21:17.477
Took my eye off it.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.912
Who moved the car?

21:19.979 --> 21:22.849
BARRY: J... T... P!

21:22.915 --> 21:24.116
ALL: JTP?

21:24.183 --> 21:26.419
BARRY: General Lee!
ANDY: Okay.
