WEBVTT

00:01.487 --> 00:03.205
That's not
Woodall coming after us.

00:03.323 --> 00:04.339
It's Sean Cahill.

00:04.457 --> 00:06.875
If your hands weren't full
with Eric,

00:07.010 --> 00:08.927
they will be full with me.

00:09.062 --> 00:11.480
What happened to "You think
I'm staying if you leave?"

00:11.564 --> 00:12.481
Yeah, that was before
I knew

00:12.615 --> 00:13.949
you were gonna screw
over Sidwell.

00:14.033 --> 00:15.817
Forstman doesn't throw
money around

00:15.985 --> 00:16.885
without getting something
in return.

00:17.003 --> 00:18.837
I have no other choice!

00:18.955 --> 00:20.689
You two are on opposite sides
of a takeover battle,

00:20.823 --> 00:23.008
and your girlfriend
is your associate.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.660
Are you trying to say
that we're colluding?

00:24.761 --> 00:26.041
You went right there,
didn't you?

00:30.249 --> 00:32.784
So we're just gonna go back
and forth trading favors?

00:32.919 --> 00:34.336
Are you my lawyer or not?

00:34.504 --> 00:37.005
Seriously, Rachel, I couldn't
have done it without you.

00:37.173 --> 00:39.057
Logan, I should go.

00:42.362 --> 00:44.196
Damn right.
You get one, Huntley.

00:44.330 --> 00:46.281
Eisenheim, you
silly son of a bitch.

00:46.416 --> 00:48.000
You think I'd leave you
out of the fun?

00:48.150 --> 00:50.035
Riceman, after you killed
the singer depo.

00:51.170 --> 00:52.387
Out of my way, Johnson.

00:52.522 --> 00:53.839
Coffee's for closers.
You don't get a mug.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.174
Am I to assume I'm getting
my own personal Litt-up mug?

00:56.175 --> 00:57.175
Absolutely not.

00:57.176 --> 00:59.261
Those are mere mugs.

00:59.395 --> 01:02.931
This, My Lady, is a chalice.

01:03.032 --> 01:04.032
Okay.

01:04.167 --> 01:05.584
It looks like
all the other ones.

01:05.735 --> 01:06.735
No, Donna.

01:06.803 --> 01:09.638
What makes this a chalice
is not the mug.

01:09.756 --> 01:11.973
It's what's inside.

01:12.141 --> 01:13.809
Wait a second. Is that--

01:13.943 --> 01:15.304
Mm-hmm, an exact replica
of the one

01:15.311 --> 01:18.363
Dame Judi Dench wore
as Ophelia.

01:18.498 --> 01:20.749
Louis, this must
have cost a fortune.

01:20.833 --> 01:21.833
Donna, please.

01:21.951 --> 01:23.471
You helped me overcome
my stage fright.

01:23.586 --> 01:26.438
You can't put
a price on that.

01:28.691 --> 01:29.691
I don't know what to say.

01:29.826 --> 01:33.745
That's all you have to say.

01:33.880 --> 01:34.996
I got one for Harvey too.

01:35.131 --> 01:36.331
You know, Louis,
I don't think that--

01:36.466 --> 01:38.133
I know he is still upset
with me

01:38.301 --> 01:39.735
for leading Mike to Forstman,

01:39.836 --> 01:41.603
but I just thought maybe
if he could--

01:41.687 --> 01:42.687
Give it to me.

01:42.688 --> 01:45.457
I will take care of it.

01:45.608 --> 01:48.627
Thank you, Donna.

01:50.246 --> 01:52.080
Hey, Mike,
Sidwell wants to see you.

01:52.215 --> 01:54.349
Shit.

01:54.434 --> 01:55.550
What?

01:55.685 --> 01:57.803
He took Forstman's money
last night.

01:57.920 --> 01:59.971
Do you think he knows
you're gonna cut him

02:00.089 --> 02:01.106
out of the deal?

02:01.257 --> 02:04.109
There's only one way
to find out.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.784 --> 02:30.051
You wanted to see me?

02:30.169 --> 02:34.723
Damn right I did.

02:34.841 --> 02:39.094
Something you want
to tell me?

02:39.228 --> 02:42.347
Jonathan,
I don't know what to say.

02:42.482 --> 02:43.932
Well, you better
think of something

02:44.016 --> 02:45.484
'cause I just got off the phone
with some asshole

02:45.634 --> 02:47.436
from the SEC who accused you

02:47.570 --> 02:50.972
of colluding
with Harvey Specter.

02:51.107 --> 02:53.208
That's bullshit.

02:53.292 --> 02:55.076
Then why the hell were the two
of you sharing a porterhouse

02:55.244 --> 02:56.461
when you were supposed
to be buying stock

02:56.579 --> 02:57.796
from me
two nights ago?

02:57.947 --> 02:59.667
- It's not what you think.
- What I think is

02:59.765 --> 03:01.966
you better start telling me
what's going on around here.

03:02.018 --> 03:03.135
There's nothing going on.

03:03.269 --> 03:04.553
Look, I know that guy.
He's full of shit.

03:04.637 --> 03:05.887
Well, I don't know him
from a hole in the ground,

03:05.972 --> 03:07.472
but I know that
you're keeping stuff from me.

03:07.590 --> 03:08.773
Jonathan, I--

03:08.908 --> 03:09.941
First you don't transfer
Forstman's money.

03:10.076 --> 03:11.443
Then you blow
a straight-up stock purchase

03:11.577 --> 03:13.497
that any first-year trader
could do in his sleep.

03:13.529 --> 03:14.529
It wasn't straight-up.

03:14.614 --> 03:15.654
I had to set up
an auction,

03:15.731 --> 03:17.199
which happened
to get postponed.

03:17.300 --> 03:18.166
Yeah, 'cause you were
sipping wine

03:18.334 --> 03:19.695
with Harvey Specter behind
my back.

03:19.836 --> 03:21.086
It got postponed
because my girlfriend

03:21.220 --> 03:22.504
was in the hospital.

03:22.588 --> 03:25.257
What?

03:25.374 --> 03:26.808
Rachel
passed out at school.

03:26.926 --> 03:28.059
Harvey and I went
to the hospital,

03:28.210 --> 03:29.344
so we pushed the sale.

03:29.428 --> 03:32.097
- Then you should have told me.
- You're right.

03:32.231 --> 03:33.515
I should have.
I'm sorry.

03:33.683 --> 03:36.351
But that's what happened.

03:36.519 --> 03:38.186
That's it?

03:38.354 --> 03:40.689
That's it.

03:40.823 --> 03:44.242
Fine.

03:44.393 --> 03:47.913
But if there is anything else
that you're not telling me,

03:48.030 --> 03:49.915
now is the time.

03:53.736 --> 03:57.255
There isn't.

04:20.646 --> 04:21.696
Well?

04:21.814 --> 04:23.365
Allison is at dinner
with some friends,

04:23.449 --> 04:24.983
but she'll be home soon.

04:25.117 --> 04:26.785
I have to go.

04:26.936 --> 04:28.737
Come on, we're working.

04:30.456 --> 04:32.207
We're not working.

04:32.325 --> 04:35.377
I am sneaking around,
pretending to work

04:35.461 --> 04:37.245
so that I can spend time
with you.

04:37.380 --> 04:39.998
Sneaking around?

04:40.132 --> 04:41.917
That's what I'd call it,
wouldn't you?

04:42.051 --> 04:44.502
I don't know.

04:44.620 --> 04:49.174
I just don't really want
to think of it like that.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.092
I have to go.

04:53.596 --> 04:56.014
Well, she's with her friends.

04:56.131 --> 04:58.099
Aren't you allowed to be
with your friends?

04:58.267 --> 05:02.320
Is that what we are,
we're friends?

05:05.691 --> 05:11.446
I was actually hoping
that we're more than that.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.118
Mm, we shouldn't be
having this conversation.

05:18.988 --> 05:20.872
You wouldn't be here

05:20.990 --> 05:24.125
if you didn't want to be
having this conversation.

05:26.045 --> 05:27.429
Rachel.

05:27.513 --> 05:33.435
We have had chemistry
from the second we met.

05:33.552 --> 05:38.023
You know it.

05:38.173 --> 05:42.143
And I know it.

06:13.676 --> 06:15.560
Rachel.
Hey.

06:15.711 --> 06:16.895
Hi.

06:17.046 --> 06:19.648
What are you doing here?

06:19.765 --> 06:21.850
I am here because I wanted
to talk to you

06:21.984 --> 06:23.785
before you came in
to see Harvey this morning.

06:23.853 --> 06:26.154
Do you want some coffee?

06:26.272 --> 06:28.023
No, I won't be here
long enough for that.

06:28.107 --> 06:30.241
Are you sure?

06:30.392 --> 06:32.360
Look, Logan.

06:32.528 --> 06:33.945
I know why you're here.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.414
If you knew why I was here,

06:36.565 --> 06:38.616
then I wouldn't need
to be here.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.368
I think you're here to tell me
that what's happening

06:40.453 --> 06:44.956
isn't really happening,
but it is.

06:47.593 --> 06:49.678
I have a boyfriend
that I love,

06:49.762 --> 06:52.347
so I need you to
stop pursuing me.

06:52.431 --> 06:55.183
No more flowers,
no more looks,

06:55.301 --> 06:57.135
no more attempted kisses,

06:57.252 --> 06:58.687
no more anything, okay?

06:58.771 --> 07:01.773
Look, you said that if
I knew why you were here,

07:01.924 --> 07:04.776
you wouldn't need to be here.

07:04.927 --> 07:06.728
I think you do need
to be here,

07:06.862 --> 07:09.564
and we both know why.

07:09.699 --> 07:12.233
You're wrong.

07:12.401 --> 07:17.288
I don't think I am.

07:17.406 --> 07:19.290
You once told me
we had chemistry

07:19.408 --> 07:21.710
the second that we met.

07:26.115 --> 07:28.633
Logan, please.

07:28.784 --> 07:32.721
Tell me to stop,
and I'll stop.

07:48.487 --> 07:49.487
I can't.

07:49.488 --> 07:50.939

Harvey, I need to--

08:28.363 --> 08:29.831
What the hell is this?

08:29.965 --> 08:31.716
It's from Louis.
He wanted you to have it.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.769
What do you mean he wanted me
to have it?

08:34.937 --> 08:37.071
You haven't talked to him
since Mike landed Forstman.

08:37.155 --> 08:38.322
It's a gesture.

08:38.457 --> 08:39.573
Now, can I please
get back to what--

08:39.707 --> 08:41.491
Oh, why didn't you say
it was a gesture?

08:41.626 --> 08:44.629
Mike has access to Forstman
and his $4 billion.

08:44.746 --> 08:46.447
Logan's on his way over
to discuss

08:46.565 --> 08:49.066
our next move, which we can't
make for two more weeks

08:49.217 --> 08:51.485
because Louis thought Sheila
was marrying Lorenzo Lamas,

08:51.653 --> 08:53.321
but I just got a mug
with something stupid

08:53.455 --> 08:55.673
printed on it,
so now everything's okay.

08:55.791 --> 08:57.258
Great.

08:57.376 --> 08:58.416
Are you done being a dick?

08:58.493 --> 08:59.827
Because everything's
not okay.

08:59.928 --> 09:01.289
- What did Louis do now?
- Nothing.

09:01.396 --> 09:03.531
And Logan Sanders isn't
on his way here

09:03.665 --> 09:07.568
because he just got
brought down to the SEC.

09:10.839 --> 09:11.839
What the hell do you think
you're doing

09:11.974 --> 09:13.257
talking to my client
without me present?

09:13.375 --> 09:14.642
Oh, he hasn't said a word yet.

09:14.760 --> 09:15.810
We're waiting for you
to get the party started.

09:15.928 --> 09:17.009
And what gives you
the right

09:17.095 --> 09:18.246
to bring him here
in the first place?

09:18.380 --> 09:20.114
The United States government
gives me the right,

09:20.249 --> 09:21.148
so if you don't mind,
I have a few questions

09:21.283 --> 09:22.366
I would like to ask him.

09:22.517 --> 09:24.118
You got questions for him,
you ask me.

09:24.236 --> 09:25.236
Okay, here's one.

09:25.287 --> 09:26.587
What makes you think
you can get away

09:26.722 --> 09:28.039
with collusion on my watch?

09:28.173 --> 09:29.693
I already told you
we're not colluding,

09:29.824 --> 09:32.043
and you harassing my client
won't change that.

09:32.177 --> 09:33.377
Will me telling him
about your date

09:33.495 --> 09:35.363
the other night
with Mike Ross change that?

09:35.464 --> 09:36.764
What?

09:36.848 --> 09:37.932
See, I think he and Mike Ross
are colluding

09:38.016 --> 09:40.184
to allow you to purchase
Gillis Industry stock

09:40.319 --> 09:41.319
at a cut rate price.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.436
That's bullshit.

09:42.571 --> 09:43.638
Then why would you set up
a private auction

09:43.772 --> 09:45.656
while neither one
of you ended up bidding?

09:45.791 --> 09:47.708
And Logan here mysteriously
bought the stock

09:47.793 --> 09:49.377
without any competition.

09:49.461 --> 09:51.612
That's it. We're done.

09:51.747 --> 09:53.667
You didn't bring us in here
to ask him questions.

09:53.748 --> 09:56.384
You brought us in here to ask me
questions in front of him.

09:56.551 --> 09:57.802
Am I smart enough
to do that?

09:57.936 --> 09:59.887
You're dumb enough to try,
and we're leaving.

10:00.022 --> 10:01.182
I have not dismissed you yet.

10:01.189 --> 10:03.824
Then arrest us on the way out.

10:03.942 --> 10:06.577
Gentlemen.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.385
Hey, what's going on?

10:14.503 --> 10:16.137
You look upset.

10:16.254 --> 10:17.405
No, it's nothing.

10:17.506 --> 10:19.974
I just found out
I have to go to Columbia,

10:20.108 --> 10:21.475
so could you just tell Harvey
that I won't be able

10:21.643 --> 10:22.683
to make the Logan meeting?

10:22.811 --> 10:24.195
Rachel,
there is no meeting.

10:24.346 --> 10:26.280
Logan got hauled down
to the SEC.

10:26.415 --> 10:27.698
What?

10:27.833 --> 10:29.166
I just saw him this morning.
That doesn't make--

10:29.317 --> 10:32.119
Well, it must have been--
wait a second.

10:32.254 --> 10:34.422
They picked him up
at his condo.

10:34.556 --> 10:37.925
Why were you at Logan's condo?

10:38.060 --> 10:40.561
Donna, please don't
do your thing on me.

10:40.679 --> 10:43.397
Rachel, what is going on?

10:46.034 --> 10:47.785
The other night
I was working with Logan,

10:47.903 --> 10:52.073
and things got intense,
and he tried to kiss me.

10:52.207 --> 10:53.874
Okay, so what did you do?

10:54.009 --> 10:56.594
Nothing.
I didn't do anything.

10:56.745 --> 10:58.963
Then why were you at
his condo this morning?

10:59.097 --> 11:02.149
I went to tell him
that I didn't want him

11:02.267 --> 11:03.351
to get the wrong idea.

11:03.518 --> 11:04.798
Rachel, if you went
to his place,

11:04.820 --> 11:06.520
you were giving him
the wrong idea.

11:09.691 --> 11:11.826
Something happened,
didn't it?

11:13.879 --> 11:15.079
I kissed him.

11:15.213 --> 11:17.498
How long?

11:17.632 --> 11:18.632
Too long.

11:18.800 --> 11:20.134
God, I feel horrible.

11:20.302 --> 11:21.302
I'm a horrible person.

11:21.336 --> 11:22.803
No, you're not.

11:22.938 --> 11:26.941
You are a great person
who had a not-so-great moment.

11:27.075 --> 11:29.026
Donna, please, you can't
say a word to anyone.

11:29.144 --> 11:30.411
Of course not.

11:30.529 --> 11:33.531
But Rachel, you can't say
a word to anyone either.

11:39.921 --> 11:41.639
Go ahead,
say what you're gonna say.

11:41.757 --> 11:42.640
You know what
I'm gonna say.

11:42.791 --> 11:43.841
Is what he said true?

11:43.975 --> 11:45.760
Logan, I am not
colluding with Mike Ross.

11:45.927 --> 11:46.927
Well, if I thought that,

11:46.961 --> 11:48.062
I wouldn't even
be standing here.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.698
I'm talking about you
buying that stock.

11:50.782 --> 11:52.733
- Look, I can't talk about that.
- Why not?

11:52.901 --> 11:55.119
Because telling you about it
would make it parking,

11:55.237 --> 11:56.153
but that doesn't
matter anymore

11:56.271 --> 11:58.155
because now that
that guy hauled you in,

11:58.290 --> 12:00.050
we can't do a thing
with those shares anyway.

12:00.108 --> 12:02.626
Well, what can we do?

12:02.777 --> 12:05.046
You and Mike Ross can get
in a room together,

12:05.163 --> 12:07.832
and put this thing to bed
once and for all.

12:07.949 --> 12:09.633
No, that's a bad idea.

12:09.784 --> 12:12.002
Logan, if we don't finish
this now,

12:12.137 --> 12:13.304
you're gonna have the SEC

12:13.455 --> 12:14.922
crawling up your ass
day and night.

12:15.090 --> 12:16.307
Look, you can try
to scare me all you want,

12:16.425 --> 12:17.758
but I did nothing wrong,

12:17.893 --> 12:19.573
and the last guy I'm getting
in a room with

12:19.627 --> 12:21.846
is Mike goddamn Ross.

12:27.235 --> 12:28.602
Don't you ever knock?

12:28.770 --> 12:31.238
Logan Sanders got taken
downtown this morning.

12:31.356 --> 12:32.523
Sean Cahill.

12:32.657 --> 12:33.574
Son of a bitch is
throwing shit

12:33.692 --> 12:34.608
at the wall
to see what sticks.

12:34.776 --> 12:36.861
- And what stuck?
- Wexler.

12:36.978 --> 12:38.418
Logan found out
we bought that stock.

12:38.497 --> 12:40.281
Did you tell him
why we kept it from him?

12:40.415 --> 12:42.083
- He didn't seem to care.
- All right.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.284
Well, it doesn't matter
because you're going to end

12:43.418 --> 12:44.919
this takeover battle now.

12:45.036 --> 12:47.288
What do you think I've been
doing for the past month?

12:47.456 --> 12:49.536
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what I'm saying.

12:49.591 --> 12:52.126
This guy's already looking
at us for collusion.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.544
The longer this thing drags on,

12:53.678 --> 12:55.158
the more likely he is
to come after us

12:55.163 --> 12:56.163
for buying that stock.

12:56.298 --> 12:58.966
In other words,
end this thing?

12:59.134 --> 13:00.568
Not in other words.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.020
In those exact words.

13:08.817 --> 13:11.319
So I guess Jonathan didn't
know you sold him out.

13:12.465 --> 13:13.572
How'd you know that?

13:13.573 --> 13:14.940
Because if he knew,

13:15.075 --> 13:15.941
he'd have come
by your office

13:16.076 --> 13:17.276
and ripped you to pieces.

13:17.393 --> 13:18.994
Instead, you're out here
enjoying a bagel

13:18.995 --> 13:20.275
without the courtesy
of coming by

13:20.330 --> 13:21.997
to tell me that he didn't know.
My bad.

13:22.132 --> 13:24.250
So now what
are we gonna do?

13:24.384 --> 13:25.624
Well, we're
gonna kick some ass.

13:25.702 --> 13:28.704
Wait.
What are you talking about?

13:28.839 --> 13:30.473
The SEC called Sidwell,

13:30.640 --> 13:32.741
and I guarantee you
they also called Logan Sanders,

13:32.826 --> 13:35.127
which means Harvey can't
use those shares,

13:35.278 --> 13:36.545
and I'm in the driver's seat.

13:36.663 --> 13:38.547
- Well, that explains it.
- Explains what?

13:38.715 --> 13:41.183
Harvey just called.
He wants to have a meeting.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.323
- Jeff.
- Hey.

13:47.457 --> 13:48.824
Did you hear what
Sean Cahill did this morning?

13:48.992 --> 13:50.960
I did. Yeah.

13:51.094 --> 13:52.795
Then you know he's poking
around the Wexler purchase.

13:52.963 --> 13:53.963
Ah, let him.

13:53.997 --> 13:55.264
You don't seem
very concerned.

13:55.398 --> 13:57.483
I'm not concerned
because I did a damn good job

13:57.634 --> 13:59.485
protecting this firm
from any liability.

13:59.636 --> 14:00.903
Yeah, well, the question is
did you protect us

14:01.021 --> 14:03.439
from all liability?

14:03.607 --> 14:07.927
Is there something that
you want to ask me, Jessica?

14:08.077 --> 14:09.845
I want you to go
back over your work

14:09.946 --> 14:13.549
with a fine-tooth comb,
and make sure it's airtight.

14:13.683 --> 14:16.151
Jessica, you're the one
who asked me to buy that stock,

14:16.319 --> 14:20.172
and I made it questionable,
like you asked,

14:20.323 --> 14:23.475
but if Sean Cahill comes at
us for attempting to park it,

14:23.593 --> 14:25.644
that is on you,
not my work.

14:25.795 --> 14:28.931
Jeff, just go back over
everything like I said.

14:29.065 --> 14:30.032
There's nothing
to go back over.

14:30.116 --> 14:31.700
We're as protected as we can be.

14:31.835 --> 14:33.035
Okay, maybe you
didn't hear me.

14:33.169 --> 14:35.004
Every partner at this firm

14:35.138 --> 14:36.722
goes over their work
if I say so.

14:36.873 --> 14:37.954
And you know what, Jessica?

14:37.974 --> 14:41.443
I'm not every goddamn partner.

14:41.561 --> 14:44.947
So either you trust me
or you don't.

14:52.556 --> 14:54.423
Hey, look what the cat
dragged in.

14:54.591 --> 14:56.892
Such a serious expression.

14:57.027 --> 14:59.578
It's because we need to have
a serious conversation.

14:59.696 --> 15:00.930
Well, let's get to it.

15:01.031 --> 15:02.248
I want you to come up
with a number

15:02.382 --> 15:05.167
that we can pay you
to end this thing.

15:05.302 --> 15:07.937
And why would I do that?

15:08.054 --> 15:10.439
Because Sean Cahill
hauled Logan into the SEC.

15:10.574 --> 15:12.608
Well, all that means is
that you can't vote

15:12.742 --> 15:14.610
the shares that
you stole from me,

15:14.778 --> 15:16.645
and that is a "you" problem.

15:16.780 --> 15:19.965
Mike, it takes two people
to make a case for collusion.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.351
So if he's coming at us,
he's coming at you,

15:22.485 --> 15:24.520
which means
it's a "we" problem.

15:24.654 --> 15:26.495
Yeah, you can try
and spin it any way you want,

15:26.523 --> 15:28.657
but I'm happy right where I am.

15:28.825 --> 15:29.992
I guess you agreed
to this meeting

15:30.126 --> 15:31.166
just to waste my time,
huh?

15:31.294 --> 15:32.294
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:32.379 --> 15:35.397
Who said
I don't want to deal?

15:35.482 --> 15:36.899
Don't play me.

15:37.017 --> 15:38.334
Here's the new deal.

15:38.468 --> 15:41.236
You don't buy me out.
I buy you out.

15:41.338 --> 15:42.988
- What?
- We tried it Logan's way.

15:43.123 --> 15:44.523
Now we're gonna try it mine...
Mike.

15:44.591 --> 15:46.425
'Cause the only way I'd get
in a room with that guy

15:46.543 --> 15:49.912
is if you guarantee that
I leave with Gillis Industries.

15:50.013 --> 15:51.313
He's not gonna
agree to that.

15:51.398 --> 15:55.901
That's another "you" problem.

16:00.823 --> 16:02.725
Rachel, I need to
know what's going on

16:02.842 --> 16:05.394
with Logan Sanders.
What?

16:05.528 --> 16:08.564
You spent an extra 20 hours
with him last week.

16:08.648 --> 16:10.065
It wasn't billed
to the takeover,

16:10.233 --> 16:11.867
and I need to know
what it's about.

16:12.002 --> 16:15.004
We were looking
at future deals.

16:15.105 --> 16:16.605
- "We"?
- Yes, we.

16:16.706 --> 16:21.010
He asked me if I could help him
put together some ideas--

16:21.177 --> 16:23.362
- Why?
- What are you getting at?

16:23.513 --> 16:25.364
I don't know if you've been
paying attention around here,

16:25.515 --> 16:27.316
but we need to wrap
this thing up,

16:27.450 --> 16:30.285
so I need to know if whatever
you and Logan were up to

16:30.370 --> 16:33.288
can force him to end this thing
with Mike once and for all.

16:33.423 --> 16:35.924
It can.

16:36.042 --> 16:38.344
How?

16:38.494 --> 16:42.014
Logan is under pressure
from his board,

16:42.148 --> 16:45.818
and if he doesn't
close this deal soon,

16:45.968 --> 16:48.370
he might lose control
of his company.

16:48.488 --> 16:50.489
Jessica, I must say
your impromptu lunch

16:50.606 --> 16:52.074
in the middle of the day
is exactly

16:52.208 --> 16:53.625
what the doctor ordered.
Thank you, Louis.

16:53.776 --> 16:56.245
Now, I must admit
that I brought you here

16:56.379 --> 16:57.880
because I have something
that I didn't want

16:58.048 --> 16:59.765
to discuss at the office.

16:59.916 --> 17:01.300
If you're firing Harvey,
I can't be in on it.

17:01.434 --> 17:02.714
I just bought him
an amazing mug,

17:02.719 --> 17:04.019
and we're in
a really good place right now.

17:04.104 --> 17:06.689
And I'm happy for you,
but this isn't about Harvey.

17:06.856 --> 17:07.940
It's about the firm.

17:08.074 --> 17:10.075
We recently purchased
a large block of stock

17:10.226 --> 17:11.587
without realizing
that we represent

17:11.694 --> 17:13.362
a client
with the same interests.

17:13.445 --> 17:14.807
You're worried
about the appearance

17:14.931 --> 17:16.165
of parking the stock?
Exactly.

17:16.249 --> 17:17.810
And I just want
to make sure that we are

17:17.867 --> 17:20.836
as protected as possible.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.441
Sure, I can do it.

17:25.558 --> 17:27.559
- You seem upset.
- No, I'm not upset.

17:27.694 --> 17:28.861
I mean, why would
I be upset, Jessica?

17:29.011 --> 17:30.451
You take me to
an amazing restaurant,

17:30.480 --> 17:31.947
then you give me some
bullshit story

17:32.115 --> 17:34.166
about a stock purchase
with a fabricated company,

17:34.317 --> 17:36.118
and when it's clear as day
this is Gillis Industries.

17:36.202 --> 17:38.203
- Louis.
- The very same stock purchase

17:38.321 --> 17:39.761
that you went to Malone
to structure,

17:39.806 --> 17:40.672
and now you want me
to double check his work

17:40.807 --> 17:41.757
because you don't trust him.

17:41.891 --> 17:43.592
Oh, question is
can I trust you?

17:43.693 --> 17:46.161
- What?
- This lunch isn't about him.

17:46.262 --> 17:47.596
It's about you.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.399
You knew I'd figure this out.

17:50.533 --> 17:51.984
Just like I know
you'll figure out

17:52.101 --> 17:54.369
whether or not we have exposure.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.038
Now, the question is
can you do it

17:56.156 --> 17:57.623
without telling Jeff Malone?

17:57.757 --> 18:03.212
I can, and I will.

18:08.234 --> 18:09.518
If you're gonna discuss
what happened,

18:09.686 --> 18:11.007
you can just forget it
because I--

18:11.020 --> 18:13.689
I am not here to talk
about that, and you know it.

18:13.823 --> 18:15.023
What?

18:15.108 --> 18:17.659
You told Harvey about
my problems with the board.

18:17.777 --> 18:19.528
I told your attorney
about a situation

18:19.696 --> 18:21.246
you discussed
with your other attorney.

18:21.364 --> 18:23.115
And now he's using it
to strong-arm me

18:23.249 --> 18:24.249
into caving to Mike.

18:24.367 --> 18:25.334
No, now he's using it
to give you

18:25.468 --> 18:27.136
the opportunity
to impress your board.

18:27.253 --> 18:28.837
Did you bring Harvey that
information to get rid of me?

18:28.922 --> 18:31.006
Logan, I didn't bring
Harvey that information,

18:31.174 --> 18:32.207
he asked me for it.

18:32.342 --> 18:33.976
And I don't need to get rid
of you

18:34.110 --> 18:36.195
because what happened
this morning is

18:36.329 --> 18:37.830
never gonna happen again.

18:37.947 --> 18:40.499
Okay, Rachel,
you got what you wanted.

18:40.617 --> 18:41.950
I'm gonna get in
a room with Mike

18:42.118 --> 18:43.919
and come to an agreement.

18:44.053 --> 18:47.473
What do you mean you're
gonna get in a room with him?

18:47.623 --> 18:49.091
Well, how else did
you see this happening?

18:49.225 --> 18:51.593
Did you think I was gonna
let Harvey take care of it?

18:51.728 --> 18:55.063
Look, please, you can't
tell him what happened.

18:55.231 --> 18:59.618
Rachel,
I would never do that.

18:59.769 --> 19:01.153
Thank you.

19:01.304 --> 19:02.905
Just to be clear,
it's not for him.

19:03.039 --> 19:04.873
It's for me...

19:04.991 --> 19:06.074
'Cause you say
what happened this morning

19:06.209 --> 19:07.242
will never happen again,

19:07.410 --> 19:10.245
and I'm still hoping
that it will.

19:10.413 --> 19:12.548
But I don't want it to happen
because you two are fighting.

19:12.665 --> 19:17.002
I want it to happen
because you want it to.

19:30.517 --> 19:34.069
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:34.170 --> 19:36.321
Do you want me to heat
some of this up or you?

19:36.472 --> 19:38.156
Mike, I need
to talk to you.

19:38.274 --> 19:40.442
Are you upset about something?

19:40.610 --> 19:42.277
No.

19:42.412 --> 19:45.247
I heard you might be
making a deal.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.168
And you're worried because
you're on the losing side?

19:50.286 --> 19:53.622
No, I'm actually happy
that this thing will be over.

19:53.756 --> 19:54.756
But?

19:54.874 --> 19:56.124
I think that you
should have

19:56.292 --> 19:58.093
Jonathan Sidwell put this
to bed for you.

19:58.211 --> 20:00.178
Rachel--

20:00.296 --> 20:01.630
You and Harvey
have so much bad blood.

20:01.714 --> 20:03.131
Yeah, and this is our
chance to patch it up.

20:03.216 --> 20:04.817
- And what about Logan?
- What about him?

20:04.934 --> 20:07.553
I'm not gonna let him get to me.

20:07.687 --> 20:08.854
That's what you said
the last time

20:08.972 --> 20:09.888
you two got in a room together.
This is different.

20:10.006 --> 20:11.139
- Mike.
- Rachel, stop it.

20:11.224 --> 20:12.474
Look, we're at the finish line.

20:12.609 --> 20:14.142
I'm not gonna pass the baton
to somebody else,

20:14.277 --> 20:17.613
and I'm not gonna blow it
because this time

20:17.730 --> 20:22.734
I've got all the leverage.

20:22.869 --> 20:26.371
Well, if you have
all the leverage, then...

20:26.489 --> 20:29.374
Maybe you should
ask for one more thing.

20:33.051 --> 20:35.130
You're a halfhour late.

20:35.131 --> 20:36.465
I got stuck in traffic.

20:36.599 --> 20:37.799
I was starting to think
you didn't want this company.

20:37.934 --> 20:38.850
Harvey, I wouldn't be
getting in a room

20:39.001 --> 20:40.318
with that guy if I didn't.

20:40.469 --> 20:42.571
Good. So we're not gonna
have trouble in there?

20:42.739 --> 20:43.739
Not from me.

20:43.790 --> 20:44.823
Then let's get
this thing over with

20:44.940 --> 20:45.940
and get back to normal.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.727
Keep that in mind.

20:49.878 --> 20:51.479
Logan, sorry I'm late.

20:51.563 --> 20:55.866
Let's get to it.

20:56.001 --> 20:58.786
All right,
just so we're clear,

20:58.920 --> 21:01.422
we're agreeing to have
you buy us out.

21:01.506 --> 21:02.640
Good.

21:02.791 --> 21:04.992
I think you'll find
this more than generous.

21:08.563 --> 21:09.864
It is.

21:09.998 --> 21:12.500
You gonna try and spread
this over 1,000 payments?

21:12.634 --> 21:14.468
All up front.

21:17.689 --> 21:18.556
Then all that's left
is for you

21:18.690 --> 21:19.771
to pull out your checkbook.

21:19.841 --> 21:22.209
Well, actually,
there is one more thing.

21:22.344 --> 21:23.811
You said it, Harvey.

21:23.912 --> 21:26.247
Let's get things
back to normal.

21:26.415 --> 21:27.331
What are you talking about?

21:27.466 --> 21:28.582
Once this deal is done,

21:28.717 --> 21:30.968
you go back to being my lawyer,
and he's out.

21:31.086 --> 21:32.136
What?

21:32.254 --> 21:34.188
You sign that,
I'm Harvey's client,

21:34.322 --> 21:36.107
and you're looking
for new representation.

21:36.241 --> 21:38.826
That's--this is bullshit.

21:38.944 --> 21:40.094
It's not bullshit.

21:40.228 --> 21:41.988
Apple and Dell don't
have the same attorneys,

21:41.997 --> 21:43.197
and neither will you and I.

21:43.298 --> 21:44.799
Mike, you two
aren't those two,

21:44.933 --> 21:46.400
and I can represent you both.

21:46.518 --> 21:47.599
Yeah, but it doesn't matter

21:47.635 --> 21:49.320
because it's not
about who you represent.

21:49.471 --> 21:50.788
It's about
who Rachel represents.

21:50.939 --> 21:51.939
All right, enough.

21:51.940 --> 21:53.040
We agreed to a number.

21:53.158 --> 21:55.209
We can work this out
another time.

21:55.343 --> 21:56.544
No, we're gonna
work it out right now.

21:56.628 --> 21:58.045
- No, we're not.
- Then you don't have a deal.

21:58.180 --> 21:59.513
God damn it, Mike.

21:59.614 --> 22:00.854
This isn't the time to do this.

22:01.016 --> 22:02.016
This is exactly
the time to do it

22:02.117 --> 22:03.238
because this is
the last time

22:03.368 --> 22:05.369
I'm ever gonna be
in a room with him.

22:05.487 --> 22:07.088
Well, finally,
something we can agree on.

22:07.122 --> 22:08.255
Then let's agree
to something else.

22:08.373 --> 22:09.773
We let Harvey choose
which one of us

22:09.791 --> 22:11.112
he wants to represent
after today.

22:11.176 --> 22:15.029
- Mike, do not put me in that--
- Done.

22:15.163 --> 22:16.781
And now that we've agreed
to let Harvey decide,

22:16.931 --> 22:19.200
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

22:19.334 --> 22:21.619
The way he got me into this
room in the first place

22:21.753 --> 22:23.994
was he knows that I've got
ten deals lined up after this.

22:24.055 --> 22:25.055
Logan.

22:25.173 --> 22:28.008
Decide.

22:38.286 --> 22:39.754
I'm going with Mike.

22:39.838 --> 22:41.439
- What?
- Mike's my guy.

22:41.556 --> 22:43.607
You knew that going in.
I don't give a shit,

22:43.758 --> 22:45.309
and I don't think
Jessica Pearson

22:45.444 --> 22:47.394
is going to let you
pick him over me.

22:47.529 --> 22:49.029
Jessica has nothing to do
with this.

22:49.131 --> 22:50.498
You just agreed
to those terms.

22:50.665 --> 22:51.749
Those were bullshit terms.

22:51.883 --> 22:52.917
So you're going back
on your word?

22:53.051 --> 22:54.101
What does it look like?

22:54.219 --> 22:57.104
Looks like there's
no deal on Gillis.

23:03.862 --> 23:06.363
Mike, you didn't have
to blow up the deal like that.

23:06.498 --> 23:07.832
Your client
blew up the deal.

23:07.982 --> 23:09.950
- Because you blindsided him.
- Fine.

23:10.035 --> 23:11.869
Then once he's had time
to think about it,

23:12.003 --> 23:13.888
you go back and convince him.
Convince him?

23:14.022 --> 23:15.262
You should have come
to me first

23:15.357 --> 23:16.724
instead of looking to rub it
in his face.

23:16.892 --> 23:18.242
I wasn't rubbing anything
in anyone's face.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.443
Oh, bullshit.
You have leverage,

23:19.578 --> 23:20.861
and you want to make
sure he knew it.

23:20.996 --> 23:22.496
And when he had leverage,
he made sure I knew it,

23:22.631 --> 23:23.881
and I didn't agree to a deal,

23:24.032 --> 23:26.100
and then break my word
ten seconds later.

23:26.234 --> 23:28.102
And I'm giving you my word.

23:28.186 --> 23:30.504
Close this deal,
and as soon as it's wrapped up,

23:30.638 --> 23:31.856
he's out.

23:31.990 --> 23:33.910
And what about Jessica?
Is she gonna agree to it?

23:33.992 --> 23:35.242
Let me deal with Jessica.

23:35.377 --> 23:36.744
Oh, just like
you did on wexler.

23:36.805 --> 23:37.805
That was a different thing,

23:37.829 --> 23:39.480
and you know it.
Do I?

23:41.132 --> 23:44.735
Get him to agree up front,
or we don't have a deal.

23:48.907 --> 23:51.792
Louis, I don't usually
get summoned to people.

23:51.877 --> 23:53.010
They get summoned to me.

23:53.161 --> 23:54.378
But you wanted discretion,

23:54.513 --> 23:56.146
and your office is within
an earshot of Jeff Malone.

23:56.264 --> 23:57.147
And you don't want him
to hear

23:57.298 --> 23:58.816
what you're about to tell me.

23:58.967 --> 24:02.436
So first off, I went through
this backwards and forwards,

24:02.604 --> 24:07.675
and Jeff did a better job
than 99% of all attorneys.

24:07.792 --> 24:11.745
Fortunately for you,
I'm the one.

24:11.880 --> 24:13.180
You found a mistake.

24:13.348 --> 24:16.267
I found a blessing
in disguise.

24:16.401 --> 24:17.935
What are you talking about?

24:18.052 --> 24:22.489
Jessica, we're not vulnerable
to allegations of parking

24:22.624 --> 24:24.158
because we never bought
those shares.

24:24.326 --> 24:25.793
We can't sell them back.

24:25.911 --> 24:27.044
I'm not talking
about selling them back.

24:27.195 --> 24:30.264
This mistake makes
the entire sale invalid.

24:30.382 --> 24:32.016
And we don't have exposure

24:32.133 --> 24:33.801
because the sale never happened?

24:33.885 --> 24:35.135
Just give me the word,

24:35.270 --> 24:36.604
and I'll David Blaine
this whole thing away.

24:36.721 --> 24:38.439
Louis, this is great work,

24:38.523 --> 24:40.441
but I don't want you to
do anything

24:40.609 --> 24:43.827
until you talk to Harvey.
Are you sure?

24:43.978 --> 24:45.112
Because I can just--

24:45.280 --> 24:47.280
- Louis, I bought these shares
without telling him.

24:47.299 --> 24:49.416
I'm not getting rid of them
without telling him.

24:49.551 --> 24:52.419
Are we clear?
As a bell.

24:59.261 --> 25:03.564
Well, someone saved the day.
Do tell.

25:03.732 --> 25:04.865
Jeff Malone just dropped
a giant deuce

25:05.033 --> 25:06.083
on Jessica's desk.

25:06.201 --> 25:07.618
Please tell me
you're being metaphorical.

25:07.735 --> 25:10.421
Nope. Made a huge mess
of the wexler purchase.

25:10.538 --> 25:12.606
- And you cleaned it up?
- Even better.

25:12.707 --> 25:14.842
Because of his blunder,
I'm gonna make it

25:15.010 --> 25:16.644
as though his shit-y deal
never even happened.

25:16.728 --> 25:18.145
- What did Jessica say?
- Oh, she loved it.

25:18.229 --> 25:20.314
- And what about Malone?
- That's the best part.

25:20.482 --> 25:22.043
That asshole doesn't
even know about it.

25:22.150 --> 25:24.652
What do you need me to do
to make this unwind happen?

25:24.786 --> 25:26.787
Nothing.

25:26.871 --> 25:28.405
Jessica just wanted me to run it
by Harvey first,

25:28.540 --> 25:29.980
but I haven't been
able to reach him.

25:30.075 --> 25:31.659
Able to reach him?

25:31.793 --> 25:34.028
Louis, what do you think is
gonna happen

25:34.162 --> 25:36.964
if Malone gets wind of this
before you talk to Harvey?

25:37.098 --> 25:39.650
Ah, shit, he's gonna
try to fix it himself.

25:39.801 --> 25:41.101
And once again,
he'll be taking

25:41.236 --> 25:42.269
what's rightfully yours.

25:42.437 --> 25:43.320
And I'll be left holding
a big bag

25:43.471 --> 25:44.855
of Jeff Malone's giant deuce.

25:44.990 --> 25:46.740
Where are you going?

25:46.858 --> 25:50.494
To do what
needs to be done.

25:50.645 --> 25:53.781
Rachel,
what the hell did you do?

25:53.915 --> 25:55.115
What are you talking about?

25:55.250 --> 25:57.618
Mike demanded that Harvey
dump Logan as a client,

25:57.786 --> 25:59.336
and it blew up
the whole deal,

25:59.487 --> 26:01.088
and based on
what I know and Harvey doesn't,

26:01.206 --> 26:03.007
it wasn't Mike
behind that demand.

26:03.157 --> 26:05.676
It was you.

26:05.794 --> 26:07.795
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry?

26:07.929 --> 26:09.964
What good does sorry do?

26:10.131 --> 26:11.382
Donna, I thought it was
the best thing

26:11.516 --> 26:12.766
for everyone involved.

26:12.828 --> 26:13.828
You thought it was the best
way to get

26:13.852 --> 26:14.852
Logan out of the picture

26:14.853 --> 26:15.936
and not deal with what happened.

26:16.054 --> 26:17.534
No, I tried to deal
with what happened

26:17.639 --> 26:20.474
without telling anyone,
which is what you told me to do.

26:20.608 --> 26:22.943
I did not tell you
to let your personal life

26:23.061 --> 26:24.144
affect Harvey's business.

26:24.279 --> 26:26.113
I was just trying
to get Mike and Harvey

26:26.231 --> 26:27.398
back on the same team.

26:27.532 --> 26:29.316
I want you to understand
that the way

26:29.401 --> 26:32.569
to do that isn't to pull strings
behind their backs.

26:34.656 --> 26:37.875
I do.

26:37.993 --> 26:40.327
Okay, well, there's got
to be some way to fix it.

26:40.412 --> 26:42.579
That's not the point.
It's being fixed.

26:42.714 --> 26:43.998
What are you talking about?

26:44.082 --> 26:46.500
Harvey's going
over Mike's head.

26:46.634 --> 26:49.219
He went to see Charles Forstman
20 minutes ago.

26:58.262 --> 27:01.414
Whoever said size doesn't
matter never saw this table.

27:01.549 --> 27:05.352
Is that an insult
or a compliment?

27:05.453 --> 27:09.089
Knowing you, Charles,
you'll take it as both.

27:09.223 --> 27:12.592
How'd you get
in here, Harvey?

27:12.727 --> 27:14.260
You crawled in
through the vents?

27:14.395 --> 27:16.475
I told your secretary I
was George Clooney's brother.

27:16.597 --> 27:18.798
She said it was obvious who
got the looks in the family.

27:18.799 --> 27:21.368
Great.
Do me a favor.

27:21.502 --> 27:23.403
Tell her she's fired
on the way out.

27:23.537 --> 27:25.171
Can do.

27:25.306 --> 27:27.833
But first, I wanted
to show you these.

27:30.846 --> 27:31.846
You want to give me
the Aston Martin?

27:31.847 --> 27:33.296
"Give" is a strong word.

27:37.601 --> 27:39.185
You want me to buy you out.

27:39.303 --> 27:41.104
You're going to buy me out.

27:41.255 --> 27:43.606
So why come to me instead
of Mike Ross?

27:43.741 --> 27:46.392
Because I put him and Logan
Sanders in a room together,

27:46.527 --> 27:48.661
and those two assholes let
their personal shit

27:48.796 --> 27:50.163
get in the way of business.

27:50.297 --> 27:51.464
So what makes you think

27:51.599 --> 27:53.633
these two assholes
are gonna do any better?

27:53.768 --> 27:55.635
Because as much
as you hate my guts,

27:55.770 --> 27:59.656
you want this deal
and that car as much as I do.

27:59.773 --> 28:03.159
Harvey, taking
your car is tempting,

28:03.294 --> 28:08.515
but I don't think buying you
out makes sense anymore.

28:08.649 --> 28:09.899
Why not?

28:10.050 --> 28:12.902
Because you're standing
there asking me to do it.

28:13.020 --> 28:18.408
Now, walk your sorry ass
out of my office.

28:18.526 --> 28:20.393
Okay, Charles.

28:20.494 --> 28:24.497
But I'm afraid you're forcing me
to use my leverage on you.

28:24.598 --> 28:26.232
You don't have
shit on me, pal.

28:26.367 --> 28:27.700
Who do you think bought
that Wexler block

28:27.785 --> 28:29.068
three days ago?

28:29.203 --> 28:30.904
I don't give a shit who
bought it three days ago.

28:31.071 --> 28:33.923
'Cause it just went back
on the market 30 minutes ago,

28:34.058 --> 28:36.092
and you're looking at
the man who owns it now.

28:46.537 --> 28:48.421
Jonathan, what
are you doing here?

28:48.539 --> 28:53.226
Forstman bought
the Wexler shares.

28:53.310 --> 28:55.361
What?

28:55.462 --> 28:58.832
They went back on the market,
and he snatched them right up.

28:58.966 --> 29:01.267
Holy shit.

29:01.402 --> 29:03.236
We win.

29:03.337 --> 29:05.471
- We do.
- Mm-hmm.

29:05.639 --> 29:09.475
You did.

29:09.643 --> 29:10.860
It's not over yet.

29:10.995 --> 29:13.146
I want you to draw up
a tender offer right away.

29:14.682 --> 29:17.283
- Jonathan.
- What?

29:17.418 --> 29:19.385
I've been thinking
about Forstman.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.221
And?

29:21.388 --> 29:22.655
You know we wouldn't have
been able

29:22.740 --> 29:24.107
to do this without him,
right?

29:24.241 --> 29:25.441
No shit.

29:25.576 --> 29:26.559
Just think about what else
we could do with him.

29:26.694 --> 29:28.578
You want to team up
with him?

29:28.712 --> 29:31.631
Well, you don't need
to convince me,

29:31.765 --> 29:33.199
but how the hell are
you gonna convince him?

29:33.300 --> 29:36.369
By giving him
a discount on this deal.

29:36.503 --> 29:37.670
How much of a discount?

29:37.771 --> 29:43.576
Thinking somewhere in
the neighborhood of...100%.

29:47.882 --> 29:49.315
God damn it, Louis!

29:49.450 --> 29:50.900
What the hell did you do?

29:51.051 --> 29:52.235
What are you talking about?

29:52.386 --> 29:53.586
I just came from a meeting
with Charles Forstman,

29:53.704 --> 29:55.384
and when I reached for
my bargaining chips,

29:55.406 --> 29:56.839
he told me I didn't own them
anymore

29:56.990 --> 29:58.758
because you unwound
the Wexler sale.

29:58.876 --> 30:00.426
Well, I was trying to save
the firm from exposure.

30:00.527 --> 30:01.728
And who the hell told
you to do that?

30:01.789 --> 30:02.789
Jessica did.

30:02.813 --> 30:04.063
She told you to God damn wait,

30:04.164 --> 30:05.485
and you know it.
Check your phone.

30:05.599 --> 30:07.734
I tried calling you.
I left three messages.

30:07.902 --> 30:09.369
I don't care if you left me
a million messages.

30:09.503 --> 30:11.287
You were told to
wait for my approval,

30:11.422 --> 30:13.957
and you didn't listen
because you never God damn do.

30:14.074 --> 30:15.341
You know what, Harvey?
I always listen.

30:15.459 --> 30:17.677
I always play
the good soldier,

30:17.811 --> 30:20.013
and what do I get for it?
Nothing.

30:20.147 --> 30:23.733
I may not be a name partner,
but I am a senior partner.

30:23.867 --> 30:25.285
You get it?

30:25.452 --> 30:26.953
I couldn't reach you,

30:27.121 --> 30:29.505
and I made
a goddamn judgment call.

30:29.656 --> 30:31.791
You want to know why you're
not a name partner, Louis?

30:31.926 --> 30:34.994
Because every judgment
call you make turns to shit.

30:37.898 --> 30:40.099
Well, then what do you want,
Harvey?

30:40.234 --> 30:43.403
I'll do anything
to make up for it.

30:43.570 --> 30:44.904
You want to do something,
Louis?

30:45.072 --> 30:47.323
Instead of using Donna
to give me

30:47.441 --> 30:52.261
some stupid goddamn mug,

30:52.412 --> 30:55.264
stay the hell
out of my business.

31:12.716 --> 31:14.834
You mind grabbing me
a couple packs of sugar there?

31:15.002 --> 31:16.853
I don't work here.
I'm with Pearson-Specter.

31:18.338 --> 31:20.139
I don't give
a shit who you're with.

31:20.274 --> 31:21.641
If you're not here to give me
something--

31:21.809 --> 31:23.810
I'm here to give you Harvey
Specter on a silver platter.

31:23.944 --> 31:27.196
I already have Harvey Specter
on a silver platter.

31:27.331 --> 31:31.117
Not like you will
if you let me buy you out.

31:31.251 --> 31:35.004
Listen, asshole,
Harvey came by last night,

31:35.139 --> 31:36.139
tried to make a deal.

31:36.256 --> 31:38.591
I told him to shove it
up his ass,

31:38.726 --> 31:40.426
and don't think
I don't know good cop,

31:40.561 --> 31:41.978
bad cop when I see it.

31:42.096 --> 31:43.062
The good cop, bad cop
doesn't work

31:43.180 --> 31:44.931
when one of them hates
the other one.

31:45.099 --> 31:47.066
And what the hell is this?

31:47.184 --> 31:48.434
Your niece's diary?

31:48.602 --> 31:51.988
It's a time capsule
of my rage.

31:56.276 --> 31:58.327
"April 22nd, 2009.

31:58.445 --> 32:00.530
"Harvey told me to file
a motion to dismiss

32:00.664 --> 32:02.699
the odor emitting
from my armpits."

32:02.816 --> 32:05.001
This is a joke.

32:05.119 --> 32:06.669
Once again, he
took my biggest fear,

32:06.820 --> 32:09.789
put it on display for
the entire world to see.

32:09.957 --> 32:12.008
Oh, yeah, I can go on.

32:12.159 --> 32:14.343
- He hates you that bad, huh?
- No.

32:14.461 --> 32:15.378
He doesn't give
a shit about me at all.

32:15.512 --> 32:16.846
I hate him that bad.

32:16.997 --> 32:20.466
You know, you don't have
the authority to buy me out.

32:20.601 --> 32:21.801
I went to Harvey's client
behind his back,

32:21.969 --> 32:23.636
and I got him.
Oh, I see.

32:23.771 --> 32:25.638
I agree to this,
you steal his client.

32:25.773 --> 32:28.975
And he'll have lost to me,
which is far more humiliating

32:29.143 --> 32:30.526
than losing to you.

32:30.677 --> 32:34.480
You'd go to all this trouble
to stick it to Harvey?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.816
Read May 9th, 2012.

32:36.950 --> 32:39.952
I'd go to the ends
of the goddamn earth.

32:43.998 --> 32:46.099
I want to offer you
something.

32:46.184 --> 32:47.684
My lucky day.

32:47.835 --> 32:51.488
Everyone's bearing gifts.

32:51.639 --> 32:53.941
You want me to
buy controlling interest

32:54.042 --> 32:56.043
in the Sidwell Investment Group.

32:56.161 --> 32:59.546
I want you to buy it
at a $80 million discount.

32:59.714 --> 33:01.715
The exact amount
I was gonna cut him out of.

33:01.850 --> 33:04.485
Was?
Wait.

33:04.602 --> 33:06.603
Did you change your mind?

33:06.721 --> 33:07.988
You're not gonna cut him
out of Gillis?

33:08.156 --> 33:09.957
Guess you haven't heard.
I'm done with Gillis.

33:10.024 --> 33:14.378
I sold my interest
to Logan Sanders.

33:16.731 --> 33:18.098
What the hell you
talking about?

33:18.233 --> 33:20.601
That wasn't our deal.
What can I tell you?

33:20.735 --> 33:22.903
When you're the biggest bully
in the yard,

33:22.987 --> 33:24.121
people give you
their lunch money

33:24.238 --> 33:26.340
without you even asking for it.

33:26.457 --> 33:28.742
Oh, my God.
You son of a bitch.

33:28.843 --> 33:32.863
You promised me
that I would control

33:33.014 --> 33:34.314
what happened to that company.

33:34.449 --> 33:36.283
I promised you if we won.

33:36.401 --> 33:37.851
We didn't.

33:37.985 --> 33:41.505
- You did.
- Yes, I did.

33:41.639 --> 33:43.590
Then our other deal
is off the table,

33:43.652 --> 33:44.652
and you're gonna give
Jonathan Sidwell

33:44.676 --> 33:46.126
his goddamn cut.

33:46.260 --> 33:50.697
How about I give
you something even better.

33:50.832 --> 33:55.035
- What the hell is this?
- A job offer.

33:57.572 --> 34:00.974
You got to be kidding me.

34:02.644 --> 34:05.579
What, did you think
I was gonna hang you out to dry?

34:05.663 --> 34:08.482
I could use a smart son of bitch
like you working for me.

34:08.616 --> 34:10.857
You're the last person in
the world I'd want to work for.

34:10.918 --> 34:13.971
I am the only person in
the world you want to work for.

34:14.105 --> 34:16.523
- Why is that?
- Because you're a nobody.

34:16.658 --> 34:19.025
You're a former lawyer who's
been an investment banker

34:19.127 --> 34:21.962
all of ten minutes, and is about
to blow the biggest deal

34:22.045 --> 34:26.600
that ever came his way,
unless you come over to me.

34:40.715 --> 34:43.567
Go to hell.

34:51.125 --> 34:52.693
Harvey, we need
to have a little talk.

34:52.827 --> 34:54.860
I said everything
I needed to say last night.

34:54.996 --> 34:58.198
Now get the hell out.
I made a deal with Forstman.

34:58.283 --> 35:00.284
What?

35:00.434 --> 35:02.836
You stuck your nose
in my goddamn business

35:02.971 --> 35:05.272
after I told you to never do
that again?

35:05.406 --> 35:06.406
No, I saved
your goddamn business

35:06.541 --> 35:10.360
after you told me
to never do it again.

35:13.915 --> 35:17.584
- You got him to sign this?
- Damn right.

35:17.669 --> 35:19.886
- And who authorized it?
- Nobody.

35:19.971 --> 35:21.922
I lied and told Forstman
I had Logan's approval.

35:22.056 --> 35:24.975
Can we get Logan's approval?

35:25.109 --> 35:29.196
You're goddamn right we can.

35:29.330 --> 35:34.501
Louis, this has got to be
the most genius thing

35:34.636 --> 35:36.803
you have ever done
in your entire, wonderful,

35:36.938 --> 35:39.106
miserable life.

35:41.486 --> 35:42.486
So you're not mad at me?

35:42.510 --> 35:45.112
Mad at you?
I could kiss you.

35:45.279 --> 35:47.331
And I can let you.

35:47.481 --> 35:48.949
Then go grab
a couple of your mugs.

35:49.083 --> 35:50.283
I'll crack open the scotch,

35:50.418 --> 35:52.085
and let's see
where this thing goes.

35:52.253 --> 35:54.588
Can do.

35:54.756 --> 35:57.257
Hey, Louis,

35:57.425 --> 36:02.896
how the hell did you get him
to go for it?

36:03.031 --> 36:05.899
We found common ground.

36:09.037 --> 36:11.872
One more thing.

36:15.677 --> 36:20.047
Charles Forstman got
the Litt the hell up.

36:32.126 --> 36:35.929
Mike, Mike,
Sidwell wants to see you.

36:36.013 --> 36:38.098
Don't tell me.

36:38.216 --> 36:40.050
He knows.

36:40.184 --> 36:43.019
Sh--.

36:52.279 --> 36:53.663
You little piece of shit.

36:53.798 --> 36:55.332
Jonathan, let me explain.

36:55.466 --> 36:56.750
There's nothing to explain.

36:56.884 --> 36:59.219
You sold me out the second
you connected with Forstman.

36:59.387 --> 37:03.140
No, I thought I could get
out of it, all right?

37:03.274 --> 37:04.954
But then you took
Forstman's money, and I--

37:04.976 --> 37:06.276
Oh, you're gonna put
that on me?

37:06.394 --> 37:09.396
I took his money because
I thought we were partners.

37:09.530 --> 37:11.798
I didn't know you were gonna
stab me in the goddamn back.

37:11.899 --> 37:12.949
Stab you in the back?

37:13.067 --> 37:15.085
If I didn't make
this deal happen,

37:15.236 --> 37:16.303
you said you
were gonna fire me.

37:16.421 --> 37:17.671
I don't give
a shit what I said.

37:17.805 --> 37:20.674
I took a chance on you.
You spat in my face.

37:20.842 --> 37:21.842
Jonathan.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.343
You stood right there
selling me

37:23.511 --> 37:25.712
on Forstman to stop me from
finding out you betrayed me.

37:25.813 --> 37:28.865
No, I did that to stop me
from having to betray you.

37:29.016 --> 37:30.534
Jonathan, he still owes us
money, all right?

37:30.651 --> 37:31.985
We can still go after--

37:32.120 --> 37:32.986
There isn't enough money
in the world for me

37:33.121 --> 37:34.788
to ever trust you again.
Listen to me.

37:34.956 --> 37:36.123
I'm--
No, you listen to me!

37:36.290 --> 37:40.093
There is no goddamn "we."

37:40.211 --> 37:43.063
You're fired.

37:44.766 --> 37:47.851
Jonathan, we can still talk
to Forstman, all right?

37:47.985 --> 37:49.402
You think I didn't try that?

37:49.520 --> 37:51.605
Who the hell do you think
told me

37:51.739 --> 37:53.406
that you sold me out
in the first place?

37:53.541 --> 37:56.543
Here.

37:56.627 --> 37:58.912
Put this on your mantle.

37:59.046 --> 38:04.084
Remember me every time
you God damn look at it.

38:18.632 --> 38:20.817
There is the man
of the hour.

38:20.968 --> 38:26.239
Why didn't you tell me
what you were gonna do?

38:26.357 --> 38:27.774
Because if it didn't work,
I didn't want you

38:27.909 --> 38:29.109
to take any of the blame.

38:29.243 --> 38:33.196
Well, why didn't
you tell me afterwards?

38:33.314 --> 38:37.033
It's all anyone
can talk about.

38:37.168 --> 38:40.337
Yeah, I don't care.

38:40.454 --> 38:41.621
Louis.

38:41.789 --> 38:43.390
Forstman's insisting
that I run the money

38:43.508 --> 38:44.869
through Switzerland
and the Caymans

38:44.959 --> 38:47.043
before it comes out on the
other side.

38:47.161 --> 38:50.964
What?
He's trying to avoid taxes.

38:51.098 --> 38:54.684
You're obligated to report it.

38:54.835 --> 39:00.390
I didn't,
and I'm not going to.

39:00.507 --> 39:02.025
Louis, that's illegal.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.810
You didn't see the
look on Harvey's face

39:03.945 --> 39:06.112
when he found out that I
was the one who saved the day,

39:06.230 --> 39:09.399
and I am...

39:09.534 --> 39:12.702
Not gonna be the one
to see the look

39:12.853 --> 39:15.989
on his face
when he finds out that I didn't.

39:16.123 --> 39:19.960
Louis.

39:20.077 --> 39:23.046
Leave me alone.

39:27.134 --> 39:28.501
Hey, did you
hear the good news?

39:28.636 --> 39:31.671
There is no good news.

39:31.806 --> 39:36.009
Logan won, which means
he's not going anywhere.

39:38.229 --> 39:41.315
You want to tell Mike
what happened, don't you?

39:41.432 --> 39:43.016
I am going to tell Mike
what happened.

39:43.151 --> 39:44.434
No, you're not.

39:44.519 --> 39:45.852
Harvey said he would drop Logan

39:45.987 --> 39:47.487
when this is over,
and he will.

39:47.605 --> 39:49.990
And there is no way that
he's dropping Logan

39:50.074 --> 39:52.576
if Mike can't even be a client.

39:52.694 --> 39:54.027
What are you talking about?

39:54.162 --> 39:55.529
I just got a text from Amy.

39:55.663 --> 40:00.083
Donna, Mike got fired.

40:01.252 --> 40:03.203
Now you really can't tell him.

40:03.371 --> 40:05.339
You said I shouldn't
go behind his back,

40:05.456 --> 40:07.457
but not telling him is
going behind his back.

40:07.592 --> 40:08.508
Even if you
were gonna tell him,

40:08.593 --> 40:10.260
this is
the absolute worst time.

40:10.378 --> 40:11.428
If not now, then when?

40:11.546 --> 40:13.430
I mean, just wait
till he recovers,

40:13.548 --> 40:14.765
and then smack
him down again?

40:14.882 --> 40:16.466
How about not
smacking him down at all?

40:16.601 --> 40:20.771
That would be great,
but I already did

40:20.888 --> 40:25.976
when I betrayed him, and I--
- Rachel, if you do this,

40:26.060 --> 40:28.362
I am telling you it will
bore a hole in his brain,

40:28.446 --> 40:31.365
and you will be risking
your whole life with Mike.

40:31.482 --> 40:33.567
- I am risking it if I don't.
- Rachel.

40:33.735 --> 40:37.988
Donna, Mike kept a secret
from me that almost ripped us

40:38.072 --> 40:43.243
apart before we
even got started,

40:43.327 --> 40:47.247
and he found the courage
to trust me with it.

40:47.382 --> 40:52.919
So I need to find the courage
to trust him with this.
