00:19.584 --> 00:22.065
'it's something you create.'

[grunts]

00:32.032 --> 00:35.296
...it's something you create.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.080
The more action you take

00:37.167 --> 00:38.690

00:41.432 --> 00:44.783
Self isn't something you find.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.569
It's something you create.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.179
More action you take

00:49.266 --> 00:51.355
the more progress you make.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.707
Self isn't something you find.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.057
It's something you create.

00:57.840 --> 00:59.363
[scanner beeps]

00:59.450 --> 01:00.625
- Arms raise, please.
- Hmm.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.976
Okay, lady in red, guess.

01:04.890 --> 01:06.283
She's, um..

01:06.370 --> 01:09.504
'...allergic to perfume.'

01:09.591 --> 01:11.332
It's...it's a good guess.
She just sneezed.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.117
She's having an affair.
Next?

01:14.204 --> 01:16.467
Hold on. Having an affair?

01:16.554 --> 01:18.556
- You made that up.
- 'Not at all.'

01:18.643 --> 01:21.777
If you look closely,
she has a very peculiar..

01:22.691 --> 01:25.389
[grunting]

01:25.476 --> 01:26.869
My attitude towards life

01:26.956 --> 01:30.307
determines
life's attitude towards me.

01:30.394 --> 01:32.875
You got a job to do,
you do it right.

01:32.962 --> 01:34.790
Stop.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.835
Put your hands
in the air now.

01:36.922 --> 01:39.273
Oh. Make a federal case
out of it, why don't you?

01:39.360 --> 01:41.101
Drop it. Drop the blanket.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.625
Your hands, sir. Both hands.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.627
- That's gratitude for you.
- Hey!

01:45.714 --> 01:47.542
Put your hands
above your head!

01:47.629 --> 01:50.675
I bring you a gift,
and this is how I'm treated?

01:50.762 --> 01:52.329
What gift?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.592
I dragged that three blocks.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.942
Jane.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.903
Pupils are dilated.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.166
- Are you on drugs, mister--
- Resnick.

02:03.253 --> 02:05.342
Carl Resnick.
I don't do drugs.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.952
Crack is whack.

02:07.039 --> 02:08.215
Steady pulse.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.390
Steady as a rock for someone

02:09.477 --> 02:10.695
that dragged a body
three blocks.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.784
- Hey.
- Let me handle this, Jane.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.873
I'll do it.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.050
So this is a gift, huh? Is that
why you brought her here to us?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.314
Her? Them.

02:21.315 --> 02:22.881
There's more than one?

02:22.968 --> 02:24.666
It's a whole bagful, fella.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.450
What do you need, glasses?

02:26.537 --> 02:28.583
A bagful of what?

02:28.670 --> 02:31.107
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes?

02:31.194 --> 02:32.456
'I'm supposed to
deliver them to the police.'

02:32.543 --> 02:33.544
'You are the police, right?'

02:33.631 --> 02:35.503
Near enough.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.027
- He's a perfect subject.
- Subject?

02:38.114 --> 02:40.160
To plant a suggestion.
He's hypnotized.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.954
[instrumental music]

03:00.789 --> 03:02.138
- He's lying.
- Is he?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.835
Oh, given that the girl
he dragged in here dead

03:03.922 --> 03:07.404
is not actually a bag of spuds
like he says, then yeah.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.972
Well, it's not lying
if he believes it.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.453
Okay. Thank you.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.982
So, Carl.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.506
Why would you bring
a bag of potatoes to the police?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.856
Uh, I-I don't. I-I can--

03:24.943 --> 03:26.684
Potatoes to cops?

03:26.771 --> 03:29.383
Potatoes.
Not doughnuts, but potatoes.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.734
Someone tell you to do it?

03:32.821 --> 03:33.778
Yes! Yes.

03:33.865 --> 03:34.910
Who?

03:34.997 --> 03:37.739
Uh..I can't remember.

03:37.826 --> 03:38.914
Try.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.786
I'm trying.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.788
What if I told you
it wasn't potatoes?

03:43.875 --> 03:46.748
That in fact, it was a dead girl
you were dragging around?

03:46.835 --> 03:49.229
You have a twisted
sense of humor.

03:51.796 --> 03:54.277
Here's proof, Carl.
What do you see there?

03:57.106 --> 03:58.629
Potatoes.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.329
He is crazy.

04:02.416 --> 04:03.591
Nope. Just hypnotized.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.288
Oh, come on.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.335
Hypnosis is just a way
to connect to the imagination

04:08.422 --> 04:10.250
rather than
the conscious mind.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.121
The mind will accept whatever
the imagination creates

04:12.208 --> 04:13.992
however bizarre.

04:14.079 --> 04:17.344
Hypnotism is what you use
againstmy explicit orders

04:17.431 --> 04:18.997
to get witnesses
to tell the truth.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.999
It's a little different
than convincing somebody

04:21.086 --> 04:23.045
that a dead girl is
a sack of vegetables.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.960
Different in scale.

04:25.047 --> 04:26.657
Well, he doesn't look like
he's in a trance or anything.

04:26.744 --> 04:29.530
Neither did Minelli when I
hypnotized him to stop smoking.

04:29.617 --> 04:32.707
The subject acts normally
except inside the suggestion.

04:32.794 --> 04:36.232
Carl's suggestion is to have
this very powerful hallucination

04:36.319 --> 04:37.668
and to forget who did this.

04:37.755 --> 04:41.803
Whoever hypnotized him,
I gotta say...good.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.719
Good enough to hypnotize
Carl into killing a girl?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.417
Well, that depends
on whether deep down

04:47.504 --> 04:50.420
Carl really wanted
to kill the girl.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.944
- But he's hypnotized.
- Uh-huh.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.946
No suggestion in the world
can make you do something

04:55.033 --> 04:58.210
against your moral character,
against your true will.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.822
A hypnotized saint
is still a saint.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.563
Not that he's a saint.

05:02.650 --> 05:04.086
Uh, so if Carl's a killer

05:04.173 --> 05:06.175
he can be hypnotized
to kill, otherwise..

05:06.262 --> 05:08.873
Otherwise the hypnotist killed
the girl and framed Carl for it.

05:10.875 --> 05:12.703
[cellphone ringing]

05:16.359 --> 05:17.578
Rigsby.

05:17.665 --> 05:18.622
So is Carl a killer?

05:18.709 --> 05:20.015
What did we find out about him?

05:20.102 --> 05:22.583
He sells cars,
boats, stuff like that.

05:22.670 --> 05:23.845
And you know this how?

05:23.932 --> 05:25.890
Well, he's very
well-mannered.

05:25.977 --> 05:27.718
A little over-groomed

05:27.805 --> 05:31.331
too badly dressed
to be gay, so, salesman.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.811
He works a dealership
over on Fulton.

05:33.898 --> 05:36.292
- Does he have a record?
- Not even a parking ticket.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.903
He's a good boy,
obeys authority.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.428
A perfect subject for a trance.

05:41.515 --> 05:44.779
He's all soft and squishy
and malleable.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.998
Well, can you fix him
with a trance or whatever?

05:47.085 --> 05:48.478
Make him remember
what happened?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.306
Well, I could try,
but without knowing the trigger

05:50.393 --> 05:52.221
it'll be like
you and I playing

05:52.308 --> 05:54.092
Marco Polo in the Atlantic.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.007
It'll take forever,
and you get all pruny.

05:56.094 --> 05:59.924
Easier just to find
the hypnotist and ask him.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.622
Got an I.D. on the victim,
her fingerprints

06:01.709 --> 06:03.014
were on file
with the school board.

06:03.101 --> 06:05.365
She's Mary Beth Hendrix, 27.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.454
Her sister's on the way
from the airport now.

06:14.809 --> 06:18.029
Yes. Mm, that's Mary Beth.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.641
She, uh..

06:20.728 --> 06:22.425
Has someone shot her?

06:22.512 --> 06:25.994
Gunshot wound to the head.
I'm sorry.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.213
The coroner says
she died instantly.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.261
I can't believe it.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.394
She was fine when I left.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.744
You live together?

06:36.831 --> 06:39.529
Um, yeah.

06:39.616 --> 06:43.228
Two country girls
in the big city.

06:43.315 --> 06:45.056
I didn't want to come here but

06:45.143 --> 06:48.538
Mary Beth said
she'd take care of me.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.845
It's funny, huh?

06:54.283 --> 06:55.458
[Lisbon]
'Lindsay?'

06:55.545 --> 06:58.896
Your trip to San Francisco?

06:58.983 --> 07:01.682
Um, just overnight, for work.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.640
I had just landed
when you called.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.077
Mary Beth's an elementary
school teacher, right?

07:06.164 --> 07:08.036
Um, she was, yeah.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.951
But last year, I got her
a job where I work

07:10.038 --> 07:11.953
at the Model Life Center,
downtown.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.870
Mary Beth was
the boss' assistant.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.785
And I'm an event planner.

07:17.872 --> 07:21.049
I help the doctor plan NLP
Seminars around the country.

07:21.136 --> 07:22.137
What's N.L.P.?

07:22.224 --> 07:24.444
Neuro-linguistic programming.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.837
Uh, well, sneaky ways
to influence people

07:26.924 --> 07:28.839
doesn't sound quite as catchy.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.102
Well, Dr. Daniel changes lives.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.322
- Royston Daniel?
- Yes.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.020
- He's the best.
- Uh-huh.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.022
Who's Royston Daniel?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.937
Dr.Royston Daniel is

07:40.024 --> 07:42.462
one of the country's
pre-eminent hypnotherapists.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.164
Mary Beth is dead?

07:49.251 --> 07:51.645
Oh, my God.

07:51.732 --> 07:52.863
You knew Mary Beth then?

07:52.950 --> 07:55.649
Sure.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.955
I-I met her at
the Model Life Center.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.654
I'm taking
Dr. Daniel's N.L.P. course

08:00.741 --> 08:03.134
to help me
be a better salesman.

08:03.221 --> 08:06.268
Did you spend a lot of
time with Mary Beth?

08:06.355 --> 08:08.488
At the Monday class.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.142
I-I didn't understand
the exercise.

08:11.229 --> 08:15.016
Mary Beth spent her whole
lunch explaining it to me.

08:15.103 --> 08:16.321
She's a great teacher.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.323
Patient, you know?

08:18.410 --> 08:21.196
Even with a dope like me.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.719
So now do you remember
who hypnotized you?

08:22.806 --> 08:24.504
[scoffs]

08:24.591 --> 08:25.896
I got nothing. I'm sorry.

08:28.899 --> 08:30.771
Mary Beth..

08:30.858 --> 08:32.947
...what happened to her?

08:33.034 --> 08:34.557
We should go
take a look at Daniel

08:34.644 --> 08:35.906
and this Model Life Center.

08:35.993 --> 08:38.387
- Let's bring Carl.
- What for?

08:38.474 --> 08:41.608
Uh, it's where
the hypnotists are.

08:41.695 --> 08:44.306
Carl is still
our prime suspect in this.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.090
We can't use him as bait.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.005
Well, as long as we don't
lose him or break him

08:48.092 --> 08:49.050
then what's the problem?

08:50.747 --> 08:52.793
[instrumental music]

08:58.407 --> 09:02.411
"Get what you want
from whoever you want," scam.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.195
Not to mention, bad grammar.

09:04.282 --> 09:07.024
Neuro-linguistic programming
is not a scam.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.418
It's the science
of willpower and persuasion

09:09.505 --> 09:11.072
and communicating
more deeply.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.770
- A way to better your life.
- Yeah, scam.

09:13.857 --> 09:16.077
A scam that can
better your life.

09:16.164 --> 09:19.080
Ooh, deep.
You two stay here.

09:20.472 --> 09:21.952
[applause]

09:23.780 --> 09:24.825
[Daniel]
'Good afternoon.'

09:24.912 --> 09:26.653
My name is Dr. Royston Daniel

09:26.740 --> 09:28.002
and I'm gonna teach you

09:28.089 --> 09:31.440
the secrets
of neuro-linguistic programming.

09:31.527 --> 09:34.225
Many of you may not fully
believe in the power of trance

09:34.312 --> 09:38.447
'but I promise, you will.'

09:38.534 --> 09:40.405
Excuse me, young man.
This is not the moment.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.582
- I'm s--
- Wake.

09:45.019 --> 09:48.283
What's going on?

09:48.370 --> 09:50.328
Dr. Daniel, w-what happened?

09:50.415 --> 09:52.417
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for Mike here

09:52.504 --> 09:53.854
for being such a good sport.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.334
[audience applauding]

10:02.427 --> 10:05.996
As you may know,
Iam Dr. Royston Daniel.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.956
[audience applauding]

10:09.043 --> 10:12.176
You're all here
because you want something.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.700
You want power

10:13.787 --> 10:16.920
you want money,
you want love, you want--

10:17.007 --> 10:19.706
I-I want a quick word
with you privately.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.185
I'm in the middle
of something right now.

10:21.272 --> 10:22.970
But it's very important.
It's about your boat.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.799
My boat? I don't have a boat.

10:25.886 --> 10:27.017
No, it's on fire.

10:29.541 --> 10:30.978
Rick, get security,
would you?

10:31.065 --> 10:32.457
- 'Look sir, I don't know
- 'Sir?'

10:32.544 --> 10:33.937
Your assistant Mary Beth
has been murdered.

10:38.594 --> 10:40.465
[Lisbon]
'California Bureau
of Investigation.'

10:40.552 --> 10:42.729
We'd like to speak with you.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.644
You're gonna have
to excuse me, folks.

10:44.731 --> 10:47.298
Um, my associate,
Mr. Rick Tiegler

10:47.385 --> 10:48.691
'will conduct the
seminar from here on in.'

10:48.778 --> 10:50.475
I hope to see you again soon.

10:55.002 --> 10:56.656
Okay, uh..

10:56.743 --> 10:58.788
[audience applauding]

10:59.920 --> 11:02.444
Okay, good. Uh..

11:02.531 --> 11:04.054
As Dr. Daniel has shown

11:04.141 --> 11:07.275
trance is incredibly powerful.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.885
We're gonna teach
you how to unleash

11:08.972 --> 11:11.627
that power for yourselves.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.324
Let's start by relaxing

11:13.411 --> 11:15.457
with a few simple
breathing exercises.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.154
Then we're gonna show you
how to supercharge your life.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.765
How does that sound?

11:18.852 --> 11:19.896
How does that sound?!

11:19.983 --> 11:21.028
[audience applauding]

11:33.040 --> 11:34.432
Hi, Dr. Daniel.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.739
Carl, is this the man
who hypnotized you?

11:36.826 --> 11:37.784
Let's have a look at those eyes.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.786
- Hey.
- 'Jane.'

11:39.873 --> 11:42.353
Do you know this man?

11:42.440 --> 11:45.792
Well, his face is familiar.
Is he one of my students?

11:45.879 --> 11:49.273
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

11:49.360 --> 11:51.841
Rigsby, speak to Dr. Daniel.
Take Jane with you.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.017
Carl and I are gonna
go back to the seminar.

11:54.104 --> 11:57.847
That way, I know
he won't get lost or broken.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.022
Can we use your office?

11:59.109 --> 12:00.197
Yes, it's this way.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.725
I'll catch up.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.220
This is terrible.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.483
Poor girl.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.311
I had a bad feeling when she
didn't come in this morning.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.792
It's not like her
to disappear.

12:29.879 --> 12:30.837
Did she have any, uh, pr--

12:32.795 --> 12:34.928
problems lately?
Bad breakup?

12:35.015 --> 12:37.234
Anybody who might
wanna hurt her?

12:37.321 --> 12:38.888
Um, I-I wouldn't know.

12:38.975 --> 12:40.803
Mary Beth's personal life
was her own.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.023
She was brought in to us
by Carl Resnick out there.

12:43.110 --> 12:45.590
He was hypnotized to think
she was a big bag of potatoes.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.157
Hmm. Strong stuff.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.551
That's an old shot.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.859
Who could have done that?

12:52.946 --> 12:54.382
Oh, very few people
have the talent

12:54.469 --> 12:56.993
to create a trance
that powerful, very few.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.736
- Other than you, of course.
- Hmm.

13:00.823 --> 13:03.304
Where were you last night
between midnight and 6:00?

13:05.654 --> 13:08.309
Oh. Wait now. You think
I killed Mary Beth?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.615
Did you?

13:10.702 --> 13:12.356
Well, maybe I need
a lawyer here.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.271
Maybe.
I wouldn't have a clue.

13:14.358 --> 13:16.099
Rigsby, is he
gonna need a lawyer?

13:16.186 --> 13:17.840
Uh, Dr. Daniel,
tell us about your students.

13:17.927 --> 13:19.581
Uh, what kind of people wanna
"Get whatever they want

13:19.668 --> 13:20.974
from whoever they want?"

13:21.061 --> 13:24.194
Who wouldn't want
to make their life better?

13:24.281 --> 13:25.935
Using trance as a tool

13:26.022 --> 13:29.243
N.L.P. can help everyone
from insomniacs, soccer moms

13:29.330 --> 13:31.506
to high-powered executives

13:31.593 --> 13:33.290
smokers, the weight-challenged.

13:33.377 --> 13:35.510
Anyone who wants
to improve his life.

13:35.597 --> 13:37.947
And control the lives of others?

13:38.034 --> 13:41.124
Some of my students want to
sell to their customers better

13:41.211 --> 13:44.040
or make people like
and respect them.

13:44.127 --> 13:46.695
There's nothing wrong
with that. Right?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.437
[door knocking]

13:51.656 --> 13:53.180
Oh. Excuse me.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.399
Uh, Royston,
I just have the files

13:55.486 --> 13:57.619
for the, uh, advance work

13:57.706 --> 13:58.968
for the seminar
in San Francisco.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.535
- Lindsay, you came in.
- Yeah.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.146
I just had
to keep busy, you know?

14:03.233 --> 14:06.106
Well, thanks. But you don't
belong here, not today.

14:06.193 --> 14:08.804
Whatever this is can wait.
It's not important.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.458
What?

14:10.545 --> 14:13.504
I'm, uh, otherwise
occupied, as you can see.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.898
Go home. Grieve.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.769
Don't worry about us.
We'll survive.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.076
Take care of you.

14:20.163 --> 14:21.556
Right.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.514
Sorry, this was, uh..

14:23.601 --> 14:25.299
...it was a bad idea.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.388
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.050
"Take care of you?"

14:37.137 --> 14:39.139
That's the smoothest blow-off
I've heard all day.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.099
I have a question for you guys.

14:43.186 --> 14:44.274
- Alright.
- Are you feeling it?

14:44.361 --> 14:46.059
Yes!

14:46.146 --> 14:47.930
- Are you feeling it?
- Yeah!

14:48.017 --> 14:49.149
Are you guys feeling it?

14:49.236 --> 14:51.020
Yeah!

14:51.107 --> 14:54.154
Alright. Now, I'm gonna talk
to you guys individually, okay?

14:54.241 --> 14:56.199
And I may ask one or two of you
to come up on stage and help me.

14:56.286 --> 14:57.853
Would you do that? Would you
come on stage and help me?

14:57.940 --> 15:00.029
'Yeah!'

15:00.116 --> 15:01.161
What are you doing here?

15:01.248 --> 15:03.859
What do you want me to do here?

15:03.946 --> 15:05.730
Uh, I'm sorry. I actually
thought you were someone else.

15:05.817 --> 15:06.731
- 'Sir?'
- I'll be right back.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.820
[handcuffs clicking]

15:14.478 --> 15:16.263
Mr. Tiegler!

15:16.350 --> 15:17.742
'Stop!'

15:17.829 --> 15:21.921
Mr. Tiegler!

15:22.008 --> 15:23.923
[grunting]

15:27.839 --> 15:30.146
- Didn't like the class?
- 'Cuffs.'

15:32.192 --> 15:34.716
Looks like I caught
the mystery hypnotist.

15:34.803 --> 15:37.153
Got what you want
from who you want.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.851
N.L.P. stuff seems to work.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.115
Come on. Buddy, come on.

15:42.202 --> 15:45.335
Come on, man. Let's go.

15:49.905 --> 15:50.819
I'm not talking about Carl.

15:50.906 --> 15:51.907
I don't know anything about him.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.214
Okay. Let's talk
about your job.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.867
Agent Rigsby asked
around at the center.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.958
Everyone says you're
Dr. Daniel's number one guy.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.221
I'm proud to assist Dr. Daniel.

16:01.308 --> 16:02.962
I'm good at what I do.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.876
That's what the model life
is all about.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.923
If anyone could put the hex
on Carl Resnick, it's you.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.534
[Rick]
I wouldn't say that. No.

16:10.621 --> 16:13.798
'Did you ever try your
stuff on Mary Beth Hendrix?'

16:13.885 --> 16:15.235
I'm not talking
about her either.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.934
Are you a drinker, Rick?
Would you like one now?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.370
Are you offering?

16:20.457 --> 16:23.330
No.

16:23.417 --> 16:25.158
I'm not a drunk.
I'm just under a lot of stress.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.550
I understand.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.335
Were you drunk when
you killed Mary Beth?

16:28.422 --> 16:30.990
- I didn't.
- That's right. You didn't.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.339
But if something happened
when you were drunk

16:32.426 --> 16:34.036
that means you had
diminished capacity.

16:34.123 --> 16:36.560
It means you're not responsible
like you normally would be.

16:36.647 --> 16:39.911
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.957
Yeah, I know that.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.133
Well, is that how it was?

16:45.482 --> 16:47.571
Maybe, I-I don't
really know.

16:47.658 --> 16:48.659
Tell me what happened.

16:48.746 --> 16:50.139
Yesterday I..

16:50.226 --> 16:53.447
I kind of asked
Mary Beth out.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.102
She said no.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.452
Actually, she said, "No way..

16:58.539 --> 16:59.888
...in hell."

16:59.975 --> 17:01.890
So last night you were mad

17:01.977 --> 17:03.761
maybe went to a bar to forget.

17:03.848 --> 17:07.417
Yeah, I-I kind of
hoisted a few...dozen.

17:07.504 --> 17:09.115
But I mean, come on, every..

17:09.202 --> 17:12.422
...everybody needs to
let off a little steam, right?

17:12.509 --> 17:16.905
I-I lasted till
about 1:00 and then I..

17:16.992 --> 17:19.212
...I kind of blacked out.

17:20.604 --> 17:23.651
[Rick]
'And then when I woke up'

17:23.738 --> 17:27.481
it was 5:00 a.m. and I was
in Mary Beth's living room.

17:27.568 --> 17:31.006
'I was standing
over her body'

17:31.093 --> 17:33.182
'and I was holding a gun.'

17:33.269 --> 17:35.837
'I could smell
the powder, but'

17:35.924 --> 17:38.405
I was just standing there

17:38.492 --> 17:41.669
As calm as I could be.

17:41.756 --> 17:42.887
So you killed her?

17:47.631 --> 17:49.111
Yeah, I-I guess I did.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.200
But like you said,
I'm-I'm not responsible.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.246
And after you killed her

17:53.333 --> 17:54.595
that's when you
decided to use your skills

17:54.682 --> 17:56.336
to frame Carl Resnick?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.294
We'd been partners
in a trance exercise

17:58.381 --> 18:01.863
and I'd-I'd put him
under a couple of times.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.517
After that,
it just gets easier

18:03.604 --> 18:05.867
especially
with someone like Carl.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.695
He's such a cream puff.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.218
What did you think would
happen when Carl dragged

18:09.305 --> 18:12.613
a murdered girl's body
to the cops?

18:12.700 --> 18:15.485
Did you think Carl was
getting out of there alive?

18:16.791 --> 18:18.793
- Well..
- Rick.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.882
We're charging you with
the murder of Mary Beth Hendrix.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.101
Stay put.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.973
- Really?
- Really.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.500
[door knocks]

18:30.587 --> 18:32.328
Be with you in just a sec.

18:34.504 --> 18:36.289
Oh, hey, boss.

18:36.376 --> 18:37.899
Has Cho searched
Tiegler's place yet?

18:37.986 --> 18:39.683
He's getting a warrant now.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.424
I just finished up
with the student interviews.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.730
- How's it going here?
- Yeah.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.558
A couple more
teachers to go, but, uh..

18:44.645 --> 18:46.951
so far nobody knows anything
about Mary Beth or Tiegler.

18:47.038 --> 18:49.084
I can't believe
Rick killed Mary Beth.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.955
'Do you think Dr. Daniel
will set up a place'

18:51.042 --> 18:52.827
'to make donations
in her name?'

18:52.914 --> 18:55.003
A charity for
a school would be good.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.570
- He's still here?
- Yeah.

18:56.657 --> 18:59.181
I've been helping Agent Rigsby
parse the sub modalities

18:59.268 --> 19:01.183
of the teachers'
language patterns.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.532
Translating their double-talk.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.100
"Reframing, pacing"

19:05.187 --> 19:07.276
uh,
"representational systems."

19:07.363 --> 19:10.410
I don't get half
of what these guys say.

19:10.497 --> 19:11.802
What are you doing?

19:11.889 --> 19:14.718
What? Uh, nothing.

19:14.805 --> 19:16.285
Are you mimicking me?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.634
It's called modeling.

19:17.721 --> 19:20.202
You, uh, model yourself
on your subject.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.379
Subject? You're not trying
this N.L.P. crap on me.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.468
No. Sort of.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.035
You said this would
establish a rapport.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.515
[Lisbon]
'Well, it needs work.'

19:28.602 --> 19:29.820
I'm going back to the office.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.387
Come and see me
when you're done.

19:31.474 --> 19:32.823
[laughs]

19:34.825 --> 19:37.176
I don't believe
this N.L.P. stuff works at all.

19:37.263 --> 19:39.178
You will.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.318
No pineapple on this one.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.233
- Mmm.
- Awesome.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.017
- Oh, no, thanks.
- You have to.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.150
It's tradition.
The case is closed.

19:55.237 --> 19:57.196
- Mm.
- Mm?

19:57.283 --> 19:59.459
There's no "mm" on this one.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.896
An hour ago, we found
the gun that killed Mary Beth

20:01.983 --> 20:04.028
in Tiegler's apartment
with Tiegler's prints on it.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.378
Plus, you know,
the confession.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.512
Didn't Rick Tiegler's
blackout strike you as weird?

20:09.599 --> 20:11.253
Well, he got drunk. He blacked
out. He killed someone.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.081
Who hasn't been there?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.039
I'm kidding.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.650
Tiegler came out
of a drunken stupor

20:16.737 --> 20:18.478
standing upright over a body

20:18.565 --> 20:21.742
instead of facedown
in a pool of vomit.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.223
It sounds more like
a trance than a blackout.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.921
Somebody hypnotized Tiegler
into killing Mary Beth

20:27.008 --> 20:28.792
and hypnotizing Carl?

20:28.879 --> 20:30.968
It's possible.

20:31.055 --> 20:32.927
I didn't eat all this
cheese and grease for nothing.

20:33.014 --> 20:34.581
This cased is closed.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.887
'You're just seeing suggestion
everywhere, Jane.'

20:36.974 --> 20:39.673
- You're too suggestible.
- Mm.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.849
Oh, right, too much
of a control freak for that?

20:41.936 --> 20:44.852
Hmm. Pot meet kettle.
Kettle, pot.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.118
Hi. Agent Lisbon.

20:50.205 --> 20:52.163
I'm, uh, here
for my sister's effects

20:52.251 --> 20:53.643
'from our apartment.'

20:53.730 --> 20:56.994
- Agent Rigsby'll help you.
- 'Thank you.'

20:57.081 --> 20:58.605
Miss Hendrix, quick question.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.520
Do you believe Rick Tiegler
killed your sister?

21:00.607 --> 21:04.959
- Jane.
- Actually, uh, I kinda don't.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.222
How did you know?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.050
Why don't you
come to my office?

21:09.137 --> 21:12.836
- I-I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's fine.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.056
Control freak.

21:16.623 --> 21:20.496
I'm so sorry
to be bothering you guys.

21:20.583 --> 21:22.063
What exactly is
your concern, Lindsay?

21:22.150 --> 21:24.718
Yeah, it's just,
it's been nagging at me but

21:24.805 --> 21:28.678
did, um, did Rick say
how he got into our apartment?

21:28.765 --> 21:30.071
No.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.725
He said he was
blacked out. Why?

21:31.812 --> 21:34.902
Mary Beth...she
really disliked him.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.860
I mean, really,
really disliked him.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.688
I can't imagine
she would just open the door

21:38.775 --> 21:39.994
and let him into our place.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.256
Well, he couldn't
have broken in.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.344
The BFS report says

21:42.431 --> 21:44.694
the front door was undamaged.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.217
I don't get it.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.437
I mean, we had a dead
bolt and a peephole.

21:48.524 --> 21:49.830
Mary Beth was all
security-conscious

21:49.917 --> 21:51.571
ever since
she and Royston got mugged.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.181
She and Dr. Daniel?

21:53.268 --> 21:55.488
Yeah, when he took her
to Maui for the weekend.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.317
'Some kids, they mugged them.
It was, it was awful.'

21:58.404 --> 22:00.144
She and Dr. Daniel
were dating?

22:00.231 --> 22:01.145
[Lindsay]
'For six months now.'

22:02.233 --> 22:03.539
I thought he told you.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.236
And voila.

22:08.239 --> 22:09.328
Would you excuse us
for a minute?

22:09.415 --> 22:10.503
Yeah.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.424
Daniel told us Mary Beth
was just his assistant.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.339
He didn't know anything
about her private life.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.775
So Daniel lied to us.
Why?

22:21.862 --> 22:23.342
Well, embarrassment,
fear, privacy..

22:23.429 --> 22:24.691
Guilt, maybe.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.388
It's probably nothing,
but it is a loose end.

22:26.475 --> 22:28.869
That Tiegler's defense attorney
could hang us with.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.610
We better
go pick up Daniel.

22:30.697 --> 22:33.830
If we walk, you could burn
some case-closed pizza calories.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.571
[chuckles]
Cute.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.225
Go inside
and find out everything

22:37.312 --> 22:39.270
about her sister's relationship
with Daniel.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.011
Okay.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.970
Hey, Lindsay, I want you
to tell me exactly

22:43.057 --> 22:45.842
when Mary Beth
started dating Dr. Daniel.

22:45.929 --> 22:49.193
No, um, Royston
would never hurt Mary Beth.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.109
Not in a million years,
if that's what you're thinking.

22:52.196 --> 22:53.633
I really am quite busy,
you know.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.548
We'll have you back here
very soon, doctor.

22:55.635 --> 22:57.593
[Daniel]
'If you could just tell me
what this is about?'

22:57.680 --> 22:58.768
Just a few questions.
That's all.

22:58.855 --> 23:00.640
Yes, a few questions about what?

23:00.727 --> 23:02.598
I'm not sure, sir.
I won't be the one asking.

23:02.685 --> 23:05.384
Oh, come on, agent.
Just a hint.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.562
You know, you're far too pretty
to be so solemn.

23:12.565 --> 23:16.046
Ah, the curse
of the pretty girl.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.397
You've been told you're gorgeous
since you were 12 years old

23:18.484 --> 23:21.051
and now you can't bear to hear
what most women long for.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.140
I have a job to do.
That's all.

23:23.227 --> 23:25.534
Are you really that tough?

23:25.621 --> 23:26.796
I didn't think so.

23:26.883 --> 23:27.884
You don't know
anything about me.

23:27.971 --> 23:31.497
- No?
- No.

23:31.584 --> 23:34.325
You're ambitious, more than
you'll let anyone see.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.241
A girl from Nowheresville
desperate to make it big

23:37.328 --> 23:39.809
but you worry that you'll always
be small town, small-time

23:39.896 --> 23:41.637
you haven't got what it takes.

23:41.724 --> 23:46.512
And that's why you're so shut
down to everything but this job.

23:46.599 --> 23:48.862
Dr. Daniel?

23:48.949 --> 23:51.560
No offense, but I've been
working with Patrick Jane

23:51.647 --> 23:53.127
for nine months now.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.868
You want to get
under my skin?

23:54.955 --> 23:57.087
You're gonna have to
up you're game. Shall we?

24:04.791 --> 24:06.096
I'll tell you again,
Agent Cho.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.317
I wasn't sleeping
with my assistant.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.362
The assistant's sister says
different, doctor.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.191
Then she's lying
or misled somehow.

24:14.278 --> 24:16.672
In November, the two of you
didn't go to Paris for a week?

24:16.759 --> 24:20.807
On business, yes.
I travel extensively, teaching.

24:20.894 --> 24:23.636
The same story
for 23 minutes now.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.072
Maybe he's telling
the truth.

24:25.159 --> 24:27.161
Maybe it's Lindsay Hendrix,
who's lying.

24:27.248 --> 24:31.513
No...this one's lying. Notice
how he can't break eye contact?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.472
I'll get the truth
out of him.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.561
Look, Agent Cho, I came here
out of courtesy.

24:35.648 --> 24:37.606
Now if there's nothing new,
I'd like to go.

24:37.693 --> 24:39.042
Hey, Cho. May I?

24:39.129 --> 24:40.087
Sure.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.178
Dr. Daniel, tell the truth.

24:44.265 --> 24:47.094
You'll feel better.
Trust me.

24:47.181 --> 24:50.097
I'd like to go now.

24:50.184 --> 24:51.968
- Rigsby, hey!
- Well, he'll tell the truth.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.535
Whoa!

24:53.622 --> 24:56.059
Alright, alright, we were
together, we'd been dating

24:56.146 --> 24:57.278
since September, okay?

24:57.365 --> 24:58.322
It feels better, doesn't it?

24:58.409 --> 24:59.759
Agent Rigsby, outside. Come on.

24:59.846 --> 25:01.848
You broke my nose,
you crazy bastard.

25:04.154 --> 25:05.068
Dude, I'm fine.
This is ridiculous.

25:05.155 --> 25:06.809
Gun and badge.

25:06.896 --> 25:09.116
- Boss, come on. I--
-Now!

25:09.203 --> 25:10.378
[sighs]
Damn it, Wayne.

25:10.465 --> 25:11.597
Do you understand
what you just did?

25:15.165 --> 25:16.906
Oh, dear.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.778
[Lisbon]
'I know.'

25:18.865 --> 25:20.693
No. No, this.

25:20.780 --> 25:22.956
No. No way.

25:23.043 --> 25:24.871
Yeah, afraid so.
He's been hypnotized.

25:27.438 --> 25:28.396
Oh, dear.

25:33.140 --> 25:34.881
- I've been hypnotized, have I?
- Mm-hmm.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.709
You're gonna make me
do embarrassing things

25:36.796 --> 25:38.580
pretend like I'm Tina Turner
or something?

25:38.667 --> 25:40.234
You wanna be like Tina Turner?

25:40.321 --> 25:42.584
J-Jane, trust me.

25:42.671 --> 25:45.369
I'm not hypnotized.
I feel fine, totally normal.

25:45.456 --> 25:47.589
Normally you don't break
the noses of suspects.

25:47.676 --> 25:48.590
What-What are you
talking about?

25:48.677 --> 25:49.722
I just questioned the guy.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.726
Do you think this could be
psychological?

25:53.813 --> 25:57.556
- Some sort of psychotic break?
- No, hypnosis. That's all.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.166
I thought you couldn't
hypnotize somebody

25:59.253 --> 26:00.994
against his moral character.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.473
Rigsby has a brutal streak.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.475
If you didn't know,
now you know.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.739
It's not an uncommon trait
in those that

26:06.826 --> 26:08.741
'choose to go
into police work.'

26:08.828 --> 26:10.525
- I'm calling a shrink anyway.
- No, wait.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.658
Deeply hypnotized subjects are
very suggestible

26:12.745 --> 26:13.963
and have very little inhibition.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.574
Rigsby, do me a favor?

26:16.749 --> 26:17.880
Close your eyes.

26:20.056 --> 26:21.884
Please.

26:21.971 --> 26:25.584
Now relax. Don't tell me,
but think about it.

26:25.671 --> 26:29.109
Think about what you most
want to be doing right now.

26:29.196 --> 26:32.503
You can do anything you like
in the whole world.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.985
What are you gonna do?

26:39.902 --> 26:42.601
I want you to open your eyes
and do it.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.863
Do whatever you like.

26:46.039 --> 26:46.996
[scoffs]

26:49.738 --> 26:50.652
[chuckles]

26:58.704 --> 27:00.793
Oh, yeah. That's what
I'm talking about.

27:02.838 --> 27:05.188
- Huh.
- Okay, he's hypnotized.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.323
Well, unhypnotize him.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.804
- You sure?
- Do it.

27:11.891 --> 27:13.675
[Daniel]
'I can't.'

27:13.762 --> 27:18.506
'The hypnotist uses a specific
trigger...to induce a trance.'

27:18.593 --> 27:21.074
Unless I know that trigger,
I can't get him out.

27:21.161 --> 27:23.337
- I have to go.
- Where do you have to go to?

27:23.424 --> 27:24.860
I can't tell you.
I'll see you later.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.862
- Rigsby, no.
- No, no.

27:26.949 --> 27:28.385
This is good.
This is very good.

27:28.472 --> 27:31.040
And he's not a guinea pig.
Rigsby, stay here.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.303
- That's an order.
- I'm sorry, boss. I have to go.

27:33.390 --> 27:35.175
Hey, Rigsby, you can't leave.
You can't. You're not well.

27:35.262 --> 27:36.306
- Cho, stop messing around.
- Hey!

27:36.393 --> 27:38.657
I'm fine.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.833
Talk to him, Grace.
He'll listen to you.

27:40.920 --> 27:41.834
Rigsby.

27:45.576 --> 27:47.143
Please stay.

27:47.230 --> 27:49.015
Please?

27:49.102 --> 27:50.407
Okay.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.975
But not for long.

27:53.062 --> 27:55.108
Come on. Come sit with me.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.152
Okay.

27:59.460 --> 28:01.201
Rigsby didn't talk
to Tiegler, did he?

28:01.288 --> 28:03.203
- Nope.
- So Tiegler didn't do this.

28:03.290 --> 28:05.074
And maybe he didn't
kill Mary Beth either.

28:05.161 --> 28:06.772
- It looks like you're right.
- Oh.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.425
Rick Tiegler was put in a trance

28:08.512 --> 28:10.166
by the real killer and thought
he just blacked out.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.777
And the same person
put Rigsby under.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.909
We need to question everybody
Rigsby interviewed

28:13.996 --> 28:16.346
at the N .L .P. Center
and anyone else he talked to.

28:16.433 --> 28:17.870
It has to be Dr. Daniel, right?

28:17.957 --> 28:19.262
He's the only one
with the chops to do this.

28:19.349 --> 28:20.829
Plus he lied about
sleeping with the victim.

28:20.916 --> 28:23.092
No, no, no, whoa, whoa,
why would he want Rigsby

28:23.179 --> 28:24.528
to smack his own face
into a table?

28:24.615 --> 28:26.182
Although why would
anyoneelsewant Rigsby

28:26.269 --> 28:27.618
to smack Daniel's face
into the table?

28:27.706 --> 28:28.968
My guess?

28:29.055 --> 28:30.883
The smacking of the face
into the table

28:30.970 --> 28:33.624
unintended side effect
of a deeper hypnotic command.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.801
- Command to do what?
- There's the rub.

28:35.888 --> 28:36.802
Let's find out.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.283
[instrumental music]

28:43.678 --> 28:46.289
I donotneed this
right now.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.552
- Jane's off doing his thing?
- Yes, and I should be with him.

28:48.639 --> 28:49.945
What the hell happened?

28:50.032 --> 28:51.773
Tiegler got off on bail
just like that?

28:51.860 --> 28:53.427
No record and
he's not a flight risk.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.777
Plus, it's Judge Milton.
He set the bail at $50,000.

28:55.864 --> 28:59.085
$50,000 for an accessory
to murder charge?

28:59.172 --> 29:02.392
Well, that's the thing. ADA
Dropped it to obstruction.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.177
A deal?
I was not consulted.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.353
Me neither. Tiegler found
some juice somewhere.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.138
Got a defense attorney
from Horton & Fleer, whole nine.

29:09.225 --> 29:10.879
- Find out about Tiegler's bail.
- Alright.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.187
Hello, agents.

29:14.274 --> 29:17.277
Nice day, huh, to be
walking free in the world?

29:20.062 --> 29:22.543
You need supervision, we think
you might have been hypnotized

29:22.630 --> 29:24.371
by Mary Beth's killer.

29:24.458 --> 29:26.590
Really?That'syour play?

29:26.677 --> 29:28.941
- You could be in danger, sir.
- You'rethe danger, lady.

29:29.028 --> 29:31.117
You threw me down
a marble staircase.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.859
- Look at this bruise.
- No, thanks.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.686
Mr. Tiegler, what if I'm right?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.645
What if you were hypnotized
to take the blame

29:37.732 --> 29:39.516
for Mary Beth's murder, and
the killer is still out there?

29:39.603 --> 29:41.431
That would make you a loose end,
right?

29:41.518 --> 29:43.738
You cops'll try anything, won't
you, to make me doubt myself?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.479
You and my mother.
Well, it's not gonna work.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.002
I'm living the model life.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.699
You have a very good day,
Agent Lisbon.

29:48.787 --> 29:49.788
And try not to bruise anyone.

29:53.574 --> 29:54.967
[Cho]
'Tiegler's bond?'

29:55.054 --> 29:56.664
- Tiegler didn't post it.
- Who did?

29:56.751 --> 29:58.840
The Model Life Center,
incorporated.

29:58.927 --> 30:00.146
- Really?
- Yep.

30:00.233 --> 30:01.364
- Look into it.
- Okay.

30:01.451 --> 30:02.583
I gotta get back.

30:06.456 --> 30:07.588
[Grace Van Pelt]
'Why are we here?'

30:07.675 --> 30:08.632
I wanted to bring him somewhere

30:08.719 --> 30:11.244
where he felt safe, relaxed

30:11.331 --> 30:14.203
something that brought him
back to his...childhood

30:14.290 --> 30:15.552
before he started
getting hurt.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.598
- Hurt by who?
- Yeah, hurt by who?

30:17.685 --> 30:20.993
Well, whoever...uh,
none of my business.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.255
Here we are.

30:22.342 --> 30:24.257
[Patrick]
'Please, have a seat.'

30:28.217 --> 30:31.481
- Nobody hurt me, okay?
- Jane, don't upset him.

30:31.568 --> 30:32.831
[Patrick]
I know what I'm doing.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.354
Are you still on this hypnosis
kick?

30:34.441 --> 30:36.399
I'm telling you, you're wrong.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.663
Rigsby, I'm gonna have to ask
you to trust me, okay?

30:39.750 --> 30:42.231
Try and trust me.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.190
I'm gonna help you
break this trance.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.845
No one's gonna hurt you...
okay?

30:46.932 --> 30:49.151
Bring you back
to your normal self.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.371
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

30:51.458 --> 30:55.027
- You've got it wrong.
- Maybe so.

30:55.114 --> 30:58.291
I mean, everybody makes
mistakes, don't they?

30:58.378 --> 30:59.814
That's life, huh?

30:59.901 --> 31:01.120
'Ups and downs.'

31:01.207 --> 31:03.252
[children laughing]

31:03.339 --> 31:04.688
Look at those swings.

31:04.775 --> 31:07.517
'Up...and down.'

31:07.604 --> 31:11.173
'Up...and down.'

31:11.260 --> 31:13.959
That's life.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.787
'Relax into it.'

31:16.875 --> 31:20.226
Nothing to worry about.

31:20.313 --> 31:24.186
'Up...and down.'

31:24.273 --> 31:27.711
Up...and down.

31:27.798 --> 31:29.670
'Up..'

31:29.757 --> 31:33.152
'...and down.'

31:33.239 --> 31:36.416
How are you feeling? Good?

31:36.503 --> 31:39.332
Tingling in your hands...
buzzing?

31:39.419 --> 31:43.031
- Tingling, I guess, a little.
- 'That's good.'

31:43.118 --> 31:45.512
Now you're watching
those swings.

31:45.599 --> 31:48.732
'Up...and down.'

31:48.819 --> 31:51.822
Up...and down.

31:51.910 --> 31:56.175
'Let yourself drift away.'

31:56.262 --> 31:59.134
Feel the tension release..

31:59.221 --> 32:02.268
...watching the swings.

32:02.355 --> 32:05.227
You're doing it
all on your own.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.013
'That's very good.'

32:08.100 --> 32:11.364
All on your own.

32:11.451 --> 32:13.018
Now I have to find
the hypnotic trigger.

32:13.105 --> 32:16.586
It could be visual,
auditory or physical.

32:20.373 --> 32:22.288
Watching the swings.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.030
[instrumental music]

32:36.519 --> 32:39.653
- Dude, don't feel me up, man.
- Deep breathing.

32:39.740 --> 32:41.307
Breathe in. Feel the breath.

32:41.394 --> 32:45.224
[inhales deeply]
Feel the breath out.

32:45.311 --> 32:47.269
In..

32:47.356 --> 32:49.619
...and out.

32:49.706 --> 32:50.664
That's good.

32:50.751 --> 32:52.100
Jane, stop.

32:52.187 --> 32:54.363
- What?
- Just...just stop. Okay?

32:54.450 --> 32:56.409
I got a splitting headache.
Just..

32:56.496 --> 32:57.540
You're just breathing, Rigsby.

32:57.627 --> 33:00.152
- Stop.
- Just breathing.

33:00.239 --> 33:02.632
- No one is hurting you.
- No, you-you are.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.679
Y-y-you're hurting me. Stop it!
Stop doing your stuff on me!

33:05.766 --> 33:07.246
[Patrick]
'Your reaction is
part of the suggestion.'

33:07.333 --> 33:08.551
It's a built-in
defense mechanism

33:08.638 --> 33:10.379
to stop me trying to help you.

33:10.466 --> 33:12.816
- Rigsby, let Jane help you.
- Stop. I-I've gotta get to..

33:12.903 --> 33:14.688
I-I've gotta go!
I've gotta get out of here.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.907
- Wayne! Wayne, stop!
- He's in too deep.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.475
If you try to stop him,
he'll probably hurt you.

33:19.562 --> 33:20.781
[honking]
Oh!

33:21.738 --> 33:23.044
[brakes squealing]

33:27.744 --> 33:28.049
[door opens]

33:29.007 --> 33:30.486
[dramatic music]

33:38.016 --> 33:38.973
[music continues]

33:42.063 --> 33:43.021
[door creaks]

33:46.894 --> 33:48.200
[music continues]

33:50.289 --> 33:51.986
- Hello, Dr. Daniel.
- Agent Rigsby?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.466
Thank God, you're here.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.120
- Help me.
- Shut up, Royston.

33:57.731 --> 34:00.038
Wayne, thank you for coming.
Thank you for helping me.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.040
- Well, I had to come.
- I know.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.607
Hey, Lindsay, I want you to
tell me exactly when Mary Beth

34:04.694 --> 34:07.436
started dating Dr. Daniel.

34:07.523 --> 34:10.439
No, uh, uh, Royston
would never hurt Mary Beth

34:10.526 --> 34:12.702
if that's what you're thinking,
not in a million years.

34:12.789 --> 34:16.010
This is just routine. Relax.
We'll be done in no time.

34:16.097 --> 34:18.839
I will. I'll relax.

34:21.407 --> 34:24.105
I feel very relaxed
with you, Wayne.

34:24.192 --> 34:26.064
Very safe.

34:26.151 --> 34:29.763
Very safe and relaxed
sitting next to you.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.592
I feel like
I could tell you anything..

34:32.679 --> 34:34.985
...anything at all.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.335
Let me tell you
about Dr. Daniel.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.208
I know.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.775
And don't worry.

34:41.862 --> 34:43.081
Everything's
gonna be fine now.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.908
Agent Rigsby.

34:44.995 --> 34:48.216
Agent, I want you to relax
and listen very carefully

34:48.303 --> 34:50.479
to the sound of my voice.

34:50.566 --> 34:52.481
You've got to listen to me,
for God's sake!

34:52.568 --> 34:53.526
You've gotta--

35:02.622 --> 35:05.364
[chair creaking]

35:05.451 --> 35:09.585
I was so in love with you...
you arrogant bastard.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.806
And all you wanted was
Mary Beth, that stupid cow!

35:12.893 --> 35:14.677
And I thought that if I could
finally get rid of her

35:14.764 --> 35:18.203
that you would see me
and love me for whoIam!

35:18.290 --> 35:21.031
But you were in San Francisco
when Mary Beth was murdered.

35:21.119 --> 35:24.818
[Lindsay]
'Yeah, but they have these
things called rental cars.'

35:24.905 --> 35:26.559
'Then I drove up there
and I did the deed'

35:26.646 --> 35:28.126
'and then I hypnotized
that skeezebag Rick'

35:28.213 --> 35:29.736
'to take the blame for it.'

35:29.823 --> 35:31.303
Got back just in time
to catch my flight.

35:32.956 --> 35:34.610
And then when I got off
the plane I thought that

35:34.697 --> 35:36.438
Royston and I
would finally be together.

35:36.525 --> 35:39.441
'That he would see me
for the gifts that I have.'

35:39.528 --> 35:41.356
- But he didn't see you.
- No, he didn't.

35:41.443 --> 35:42.575
It's hard when
they don't see you.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.794
What a moron I was.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.187
'What a moron!'

35:46.274 --> 35:49.495
'I came to you,
and you said to me'

35:49.582 --> 35:51.497
"Oh, it's not important.

35:51.584 --> 35:55.240
We'll do fine without you.
Go home."

35:55.327 --> 35:56.763
Do you remember that?

35:56.850 --> 35:57.851
Look at me!

35:59.853 --> 36:01.376
And I knew in that moment

36:01.463 --> 36:03.683
that you would never love me.

36:03.770 --> 36:04.858
'Never.'

36:08.557 --> 36:09.602
So now you're gonna die.

36:12.082 --> 36:15.608
Rigsby...he hurt me.

36:15.695 --> 36:17.044
He hurt me, Rigsby.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.876
[grunts]

36:22.963 --> 36:24.791
[laughs]

36:27.010 --> 36:29.448
You love to protect women,
don't you?

36:29.535 --> 36:31.276
I saw how you looked
at that red-haired agent.

36:31.363 --> 36:34.453
Grace. Her name's Grace.

36:34.540 --> 36:38.065
Wayne, I need your protection
right now.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.980
I need your help
with a special job.

36:40.067 --> 36:41.286
You'll help me, won't you?

36:41.373 --> 36:42.809
Sure. What do you
need me to do?

36:42.896 --> 36:45.464
- I need you to take--
- Hello, Rigsby.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.508
Hey, is that...

36:46.595 --> 36:47.553
Venus or Mercury?

36:50.425 --> 36:52.732
Hansel and Gretel had
bread crumbs. I had Rigsby.

36:52.819 --> 36:54.908
I knew he'd lead me to the
guilty one so I put

36:54.995 --> 36:56.170
a tracking device
in his pocket.

37:00.392 --> 37:01.610
Bingo.

37:01.697 --> 37:03.308
Smart.

37:03.395 --> 37:05.614
Except for the part
where I have the gun.

37:08.835 --> 37:11.011
Oh, I have a gun, too.
Lisbon?

37:11.098 --> 37:14.754
Drop the weapon!

37:14.841 --> 37:16.625
So predictable.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.105
Rick!

37:18.192 --> 37:19.585
You should put the gun down now.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.067
Oh, for heaven's sake.

37:24.154 --> 37:25.895
Drop the weapon,
Agent Lisbon.

37:25.982 --> 37:29.029
Tiegler, this is your first day
out on bail. Don't do--

37:29.116 --> 37:31.249
Shut up!
I said drop it!

37:31.336 --> 37:32.946
Best do as she says.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.911
[Patrick]
Oh, I'm impressed, Lindsay.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.045
There's not three people
in the world

37:45.132 --> 37:47.482
that could've done
an induction on a cop.

37:47.569 --> 37:51.878
But Rigsby's guard was up when
he was with Dr. Daniel and Carl.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.053
And you?

37:54.533 --> 37:55.795
You just crept through
the cracks

37:55.882 --> 37:57.187
you sneaky little mouse.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.625
Well..

37:59.712 --> 38:02.845
I was never
the sparkling, vivacious one.

38:02.932 --> 38:04.194
'That was Mary Beth.'

38:04.282 --> 38:06.893
And all the boys loved her..

38:06.980 --> 38:09.112
...never me..

38:09.199 --> 38:11.593
Until I went to work
for Dr. Daniel.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.466
Then I realized
I have a talent

38:14.553 --> 38:16.076
for reaching
people's unconscious.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.513
People let their defenses
down with me.

38:18.600 --> 38:21.081
'They trust me.'

38:21.168 --> 38:24.084
Finally, I was worth something.

38:24.171 --> 38:27.392
Finally, I'm in control.

38:27.479 --> 38:31.047
Look around yourself.
Are you in control now?

38:31.134 --> 38:33.049
All these people here
have to die.

38:33.136 --> 38:36.662
That's not control.
That's madness.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
You're having
a nervous breakdown, Lindsay.

38:39.926 --> 38:42.232
You need help.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.973
We can help you.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.195
It's beautiful night
for a swim.

38:48.282 --> 38:50.066
Don't you think?

38:50.153 --> 38:52.678
Yeah.

38:52.765 --> 38:53.896
The ocean
is so nice tonight.

38:56.159 --> 38:58.988
Hear the crash of the waves,
Rigsby?

38:59.075 --> 39:00.773
- It's peaceful.
- Yeah, it's nice.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.949
It's not nice, Rigsby.
It's not the ocean.

39:03.036 --> 39:04.951
[Lindsay]
'Hey, now why don't you take
Royston for a little swim?'

39:05.038 --> 39:06.605
'Show him that dark,
beautiful ocean.'

39:06.692 --> 39:08.346
No.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.043
[Lindsay]
That's right.
Take him for a swim.

39:10.130 --> 39:12.306
I love night swims.
Don't you?

39:12.393 --> 39:15.309
Stop...Rigsby, don't.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.007
[chair wheels clanking]

39:18.094 --> 39:20.967
Rigsby, listen to me.
Listen to my voice.

39:21.054 --> 39:24.666
Why don't you take Jane for
a swim? I think he wants to go.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.059
I-I-I-I-I don't want to.
I don't wanna go!

39:26.146 --> 39:27.365
[Lisbon]
'Rigsby!'

39:27.452 --> 39:29.628
Come on, let's go swimming,
Jane.

39:29.715 --> 39:31.325
No, no! It's-it's
not water down there!

39:31.412 --> 39:33.327
- It's concrete!
- The water's gorgeous.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.198
[Lindsay]
'Mr. Jane loves to swim,
just like you do, Rigsby.'

39:35.285 --> 39:37.418
- Stop, Rigsby. Stop!
- Yeah, take him for a swim.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.768
Take him over. He wants to go.
Push him over, Rigsby.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.857
No, Rigsby! Shark!
Shark! There! See it?

39:41.944 --> 39:43.381
It's a great white.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.860
- Sharks? Where?
- There's no sharks, Rigsby.

39:44.947 --> 39:46.514
- The water's fine.
- She's lying.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.124
- Just take him in!
- She wants you to get eaten.

39:48.211 --> 39:49.691
Throw him in! Throw him over!

39:49.778 --> 39:51.737
- Who is this woman?
- Throw him over.

39:51.824 --> 39:53.173
- Don't--
- Shoulder?

39:53.260 --> 39:54.914
- Ah, it's the shoulder!
- Throw him in, Rigsby!

39:55.001 --> 39:56.742
Shoulder! Wait! Wait!

39:56.829 --> 39:58.744
- Gun!
- Damn it!

39:58.831 --> 40:00.267
[dramatic music]

40:01.181 --> 40:03.401
[grunts]

40:05.968 --> 40:08.710
Yes, gun.
Thanks, Rigsby.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.451
You, my friend, have been
in a trance state.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.627
- Get outta here.
- Oh, I'd love to.

40:12.714 --> 40:14.760
[grunts]

40:14.847 --> 40:16.762
Let's go.

40:16.849 --> 40:18.851
[panting]

40:19.939 --> 40:22.594
Jane, would you untie him?

40:22.681 --> 40:23.595
Come on.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.648
I don't know, I just suddenly
came out of it and then, uh

40:33.735 --> 40:35.389
boom, just had to take her down,
you know?

40:35.476 --> 40:36.651
Yeah, you took down
a 100-pound woman

40:36.738 --> 40:38.000
but in that context
you did good.

40:38.087 --> 40:40.089
What do you mean,
"in that context"?

40:40.176 --> 40:43.789
Oh, in the context of someone
letting himself get hypnotized

40:43.876 --> 40:46.356
nearly throwing his colleague
off a building

40:46.444 --> 40:49.838
and then finally being able
to overpower a small crazy woman

40:49.925 --> 40:52.406
to retrieve the situation,
you did okay.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.627
Oh, be fair. A small crazy woman
with a gun. A gun is a gun.

40:55.714 --> 40:58.325
And anyone can be hypnotized.
She was very good.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.980
- Very good.
- Not as good as me, but close.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.547
Close-ish.

41:02.634 --> 41:05.114
Which is why
the professional standards unit

41:05.201 --> 41:08.161
has cleared you
for assaulting Dr. Daniel.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.597
You weren't yourself.

41:11.425 --> 41:14.123
But he is now, right?
Himself?

41:14.210 --> 41:15.864
Completely unprogrammed?

41:15.951 --> 41:16.865
Yes, he is.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.214
Last two days are gone

41:18.301 --> 41:20.042
but other than that,
I'm good to go.

41:20.129 --> 41:22.392
Oh, so you don't
remember anything

41:22.480 --> 41:23.698
from when you were
hypnotized?

41:23.785 --> 41:26.701
Fragments.
But, no, not really.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.703
Thank goodness, right?

41:28.790 --> 41:31.227
- Yeah.
- Oh, Lord.

41:31.314 --> 41:33.882
Did I make a fool of myself?

41:33.969 --> 41:37.146
Cluck like a chicken?
I didn't do Tina Turner, did I?

41:37.233 --> 41:40.149
No. You were perfectly normal.

41:40.236 --> 41:41.803
Oh. Good.

41:41.890 --> 41:44.545
That's a relief, eh?

41:44.632 --> 41:45.981
Coward.

41:46.068 --> 41:47.200
What?

41:47.287 --> 41:49.507
You honestly don't remember it?

41:49.594 --> 41:51.770
- Don't remember what?
- He remembers.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.728
Hesoremembers.

41:53.815 --> 41:56.514
What?

41:56.601 --> 41:57.645
It'll come to you.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.564
[scoffs]

42:05.348 --> 42:08.264
[instrumental music]
