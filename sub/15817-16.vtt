00:02.970 --> 00:03.871
THIS SEASON ON LOVE &

00:03.871 --> 00:06.174
HIP-HOP: ATLANTA...

00:06.174 --> 00:08.276
BEING IN LOVE CAN FEEL LIKE

00:08.276 --> 00:09.810
A DREAM...

00:09.810 --> 00:10.644
BABE, ARE YOU READY TO MARRY

00:10.644 --> 00:12.813
ME NOW?

00:12.813 --> 00:13.747
I REALLY JUST WANT EVERYBODY

00:13.747 --> 00:14.882
TO BE AS HAPPY AS WE ARE.

00:14.882 --> 00:16.117
NOBODY'S GONNA BE AS HAPPY AS

00:16.117 --> 00:16.784
WE ARE.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.152
WHETHER IT'S REKINDLING

00:18.152 --> 00:18.886
A ROMANCE...

00:18.886 --> 00:20.221
TOAST TO NEW BEGINNINGS.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.456
OR DISCOVERING SOMETHING NEW.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.457
I'M GLAD THIS FINALLY

00:23.457 --> 00:24.158
HAPPENED.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.026
BUT THAT DREAM...

00:26.026 --> 00:26.960
I'M PREGNANT.

00:26.960 --> 00:27.995
CAN QUICKLY TURN

00:27.995 --> 00:29.130
INTO A NIGHTMARE.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.298
YOU'RE STILL AT A STAGE WHERE

00:30.298 --> 00:31.899
YOU CAN "X" THAT RIGHT THERE

00:31.899 --> 00:32.766
OUT THE PICTURE.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.501
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?

00:33.501 --> 00:34.435
YOU THINK THAT'S [bleep] FUNNY?

00:34.435 --> 00:35.103
DOES IT SEEM LIKE

00:35.103 --> 00:35.769
I'M BEING FUNNY?

00:35.769 --> 00:36.904
HOW MANY TIMES HAS SHE CALLED

00:36.904 --> 00:37.605
ME A BITCH?

00:37.605 --> 00:38.272
HUH?

00:38.272 --> 00:39.140
HOW MANY TIMES?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.909
[yelling indistinctly]

00:41.909 --> 00:43.611
LINES ARE CROSSED...

00:43.611 --> 00:45.045
DO YOU WANT TO START A FIRE?

00:45.045 --> 00:46.980
GET OUT OF MY FACE.

00:46.980 --> 00:48.849
AND ALLEGIANCES BROKEN...

00:48.849 --> 00:49.550
I'M A LIAR?

00:49.550 --> 00:50.418
YOU GONNA CHECK THIS [bleep]

00:50.418 --> 00:51.085
OR WHAT?

00:51.085 --> 00:51.785
WE GOT A HISTORY.

00:51.785 --> 00:52.453
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAN?

00:52.453 --> 00:53.221
IT AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO

00:53.221 --> 00:53.887
WITH HER.

00:53.887 --> 00:54.655
SO THEN WE AIN'T BROTHERS

00:54.655 --> 00:55.323
NO MORE THEN, I GUESS.

00:55.323 --> 00:55.989
I'M COOL WITH THAT.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.891
AS FRIENDS BECOME ENEMIES

00:57.891 --> 00:59.160
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.061
IF IT'S NOT ABOUT K.MICHELLE,

01:01.061 --> 01:02.130
SHE HAS TO MAKE IT ABOUT HER.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.164
YOU CAN RUN YOUR MOUTH...

01:03.164 --> 01:04.098
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

01:04.098 --> 01:04.798
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE

01:04.798 --> 01:06.734
A [bleep] MAN.

01:06.734 --> 01:07.701
BRING IT.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.103
WHEN THE ONES YOU LOVE

01:09.103 --> 01:10.871
BETRAY YOUR TRUST,

01:10.871 --> 01:12.005
IT CUTS DEEP.

01:12.005 --> 01:12.673
YOU BEEN TOUCHING

01:12.673 --> 01:13.441
OTHER BITCHES.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.475
I DON'T WANT YOU TOUCHING ME.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.243
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

01:15.243 --> 01:16.277
GET THE [bleep] OUT.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.446
BUT FOR EVERY ACTION,

01:18.446 --> 01:19.813
THERE IS A REACTION.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.115
I PAWNED THE RING.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.184
IN THIS GAME, THERE ARE NO

01:23.184 --> 01:24.285
EASY CHOICES.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.254
JUST REALLY CONSIDER GETTING

01:26.254 --> 01:28.156
MARRIED AGAIN.

01:28.156 --> 01:29.357
I WANT TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.191
ARE WE ENGAGED?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.091
IS THAT OUR BOND?

01:31.091 --> 01:32.560
THIS IS JUST, LIKE, SOME

01:32.560 --> 01:34.094
SMALL TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION

01:34.094 --> 01:35.263

06:52.780 --> 06:53.647
WHILE YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT IT

06:53.647 --> 06:55.949

06:55.949 --> 06:56.850
ALTHOUGH YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

06:56.850 --> 06:57.918
ABLE TO TELL BY WHAT JUST WENT

06:57.918 --> 06:59.386

06:59.386 --> 07:01.021
THAT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T ALWAYS

07:01.021 --> 07:01.889
THE CASE.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.390
THE NOT-SO-FRIENDLY FIRE THESE

07:03.390 --> 07:05.125
LADIES UNLEASHED ON ONE ANOTHER

07:05.125 --> 07:07.094
WAS SO RAPID, IN SOME CASES,

07:07.094 --> 07:08.462
IT WAS HARD FOR EVEN US

07:08.462 --> 07:09.563
TO KEEP UP.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.131
THESE LADIES WENT FROM FRIENDS

07:11.131 --> 07:12.700

07:12.700 --> 07:14.201
SO QUICKLY, YOU WOULD'VE THOUGHT

07:14.201 --> 07:15.335
THEY COINED THE PHRASE

07:15.335 --> 07:16.403
"FRENEMIES."

07:16.403 --> 07:17.905
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

07:17.905 --> 07:19.172
I THINK PEOPLE USE THE TERM

07:19.172 --> 07:20.641
"FRIEND" A LITTLE TOO LIGHTLY.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.876
[bell dings]

WHY DO YOU THINK YOU GUYS WERE

09:05.345 --> 09:06.880
I JUST BELIEVE IN GIRL POWER.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.348
AND IT WAS IGNORANT,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.117
AND THAT'S WHAT THAT WAS.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.118
SO YOU GUYS WERE JUST ABLE TO

09:11.118 --> 09:12.085
KISS AND MAKE UP.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.275

09:35.275 --> 09:36.343
SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON TO BE

09:36.343 --> 09:37.611
ABLE TO ACCEPT THEIR TRUTH.

09:37.611 --> 09:38.646
RIGHT.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.180
WELL, MIMI, THE DRAMA WITH YOU

09:43.784 --> 09:45.318

09:45.318 --> 09:46.286

OKAY.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.563
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S TAKE

09:56.563 --> 09:57.364
A FAN QUESTION.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.332
THIS ONE'S FROM VANESSA C.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.235
"TRACI, WHY DID YOU GET INVOLVED

10:02.235 --> 10:04.404
IN SHAY AND ERICA'S BEEF?"

10:04.404 --> 10:05.572
I WAS FRIENDS WITH SHAY,

10:05.572 --> 10:07.307
AND I THOUGHT ERICA WAS REALLY

10:07.307 --> 10:09.376
COOL, AND I DIDN'T--EVERY TIME

10:09.376 --> 10:10.577
WE WENT SOMEWHERE AND THEY WERE

10:10.577 --> 10:11.879
IN THE SAME BUILDING, I MEAN,

10:11.879 --> 10:13.480
THE TENSION WAS SO THICK.

10:13.480 --> 10:14.447
BUT I WANTED THEM--I WANTED TO

10:14.447 --> 10:15.615
PUT THEM TOGETHER SO THEY COULD

10:15.615 --> 10:17.550
JUST GET EVERYTHING OUT AND THEN

10:17.550 --> 10:18.218
LET IT BE.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.219
YOU COULD GO YOUR SEPARATE WAYS.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.520
THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

10:20.520 --> 10:21.454
SHAY, DID YOU TAKE IT

10:21.454 --> 10:22.155
THAT WAY?

10:22.155 --> 10:23.724
DID YOU FEEL LIKE TRACI HAD KIND

10:23.724 --> 10:25.325
OF SET YOU UP IN THE SITUATION?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.894
UM, I DON'T THINK THAT WAS

10:26.894 --> 10:27.928
HER INTENTIONS.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.396
IT JUST CAME OUT THAT WAY.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.798
MY INTENTIONS WAS TO TALK TO

10:30.798 --> 10:32.099
ERICA AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS

10:32.099 --> 10:34.101
GOING ON, BUT HER APPROACH OF,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.035
"WHY YOU GOT MY NAME IN YOUR

10:35.035 --> 10:37.504
MOUTH" THREW ME OFF.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.605
I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IGNORANCE

10:38.605 --> 10:39.372
NONE.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.640
AND YOU THE MOST

10:40.640 --> 10:41.408
IGNORANT ONE.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.575
I CAN'T.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.977
I THINK ERICA FEEL LIKE SHAY

10:43.977 --> 10:46.013
WAS A SIDEKICK OR THE SIDE HO

10:46.013 --> 10:47.848
OR THE POPCORN GROUPIE BITCH.

10:47.848 --> 10:48.648

10:49.316 --> 10:50.583

10:50.583 --> 10:51.719
THAT'S JUST HOW IT WAS.

10:51.719 --> 10:52.986
AND FOR WHATEVER REASON,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.154
SHE MORE MAD AT ME THAN SHE IS

10:59.827 --> 11:00.560

17:10.697 --> 17:11.331
LET ME SEE.

17:11.331 --> 17:11.998
PULL OUT YOUR PHONE.

17:11.998 --> 17:12.832
MIMI, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

17:12.832 --> 17:14.134
YOU GUYS SLEPT TOGETHER?

17:14.134 --> 17:15.034
SHOW ME.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.336
SINCE HE WAS [bleep] WITH

17:16.336 --> 17:17.070
HER.

17:17.070 --> 17:18.037
SHOW ME THE TEXTS.

17:18.037 --> 17:18.771
SO YOU GUYS HAVE NOT BEEN

17:18.771 --> 17:20.006
SLEEPING TOGETHER AT ALL?

17:20.006 --> 17:21.141
BUT HE'S STILL COMING AROUND

17:21.141 --> 17:21.941
LOOKING FOR IT?

17:21.941 --> 17:22.875
HE'S STILL ASKING ME TO

17:22.875 --> 17:24.577
[bleep] HIS [bleep].

17:24.577 --> 17:25.545
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO [bleep]

17:25.545 --> 17:26.279
HIS [bleep]?

17:26.279 --> 17:29.282
THAT AIN'T WHAT I SAID.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.550
YOU KNOW, I SAID SOMETHING

17:30.550 --> 17:31.651
ABOUT LETTUCE.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.385
WHAT IS THAT?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.186
THAT'S [bleep].

17:33.186 --> 17:34.787
[laughter]

17:34.787 --> 17:35.722
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU THIS,

17:35.722 --> 17:36.389
JOSELINE.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.857
DO YOU BELIEVE THE FACT THAT

17:37.857 --> 17:39.058
THEY DID NOT SLEEP TOGETHER?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.627
YOU KNOW WHAT, IF HE DOES

17:40.627 --> 17:42.195
TEXT HER TO GET A LITTLE LETTUCE

17:42.195 --> 17:43.430
OR WHATEVER IT IS, I'M PRETTY

17:43.430 --> 17:44.631
SURE SHE AIN'T THE ONLY ONE,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.866
SO I TRY--I'M TRYING TO CHANGE

17:46.866 --> 17:48.335
HIM AND MAKE HIM BECOME A BETTER

17:48.335 --> 17:50.203
MAN, BECAUSE I LOVE HIM,

17:50.203 --> 17:51.538
AND HE'S A GREAT GUY.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.872
HE'S NEVER HAD A WOMAN LIKE ME

17:52.872 --> 17:54.141
THAT PUT IT DOWN LIKE THEY

17:54.141 --> 17:55.442
SUPPOSED TO.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.044
AND AS FAR AS, LIKE, HIM GIVING

17:58.044 --> 17:59.712
MIMI A FRIENDSHIP RING ON THE

17:59.712 --> 18:01.714
SAME DAY HE GAVE ME A RING,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.049
I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS TYPICAL

18:03.049 --> 18:04.384
STEVIE, BUT IT GOT ME SO UPSET

18:04.384 --> 18:05.152
THAT I HAD TO PUT MY HANDS

18:05.152 --> 18:05.818
IN THE AIR.

18:05.818 --> 18:06.653
YEAH, 'CAUSE WE DEFINITELY

18:06.653 --> 18:07.354
SAW THAT.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.988
IT WAS VERY UPSETTING FOR YOU.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.089
BUT, ONCE AGAIN, WE TALKING

18:10.089 --> 18:11.958
ABOUT [bleep] CLEVER STEVIE.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.560
SO YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT

18:13.560 --> 18:14.394
THAT CLEVER.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.295
HAVE YOU FORGIVEN HIM FOR

18:15.295 --> 18:16.095
THAT, JOSELINE?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
I--YOU KNOW WHAT, I'MA TELL

18:17.096 --> 18:17.764
YOU LIKE THIS--

18:17.764 --> 18:18.531
WHAT DID I DO?

18:18.531 --> 18:19.799
WHAT DID YOU DO?

18:19.799 --> 18:20.833
I FORGIVE STEVIE.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.136
LIKE HE SAY, I'M LIKE A PIECE OF

18:23.136 --> 18:24.070
CAKE WITH HIM, BECAUSE IT'S

18:24.070 --> 18:26.005
LIKE, THERE IS NOT ONE DAY THAT

18:26.005 --> 18:27.140
I DON'T SLEEP WITH THIS MAN.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.107
THERE IS NOT ONE DAY THAT I

18:28.107 --> 18:29.108
DON'T SEE THIS MAN.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.109
AND THAT'S WHY I WON'T

18:30.109 --> 18:31.811
[bleep] WITH HIM EVER AGAIN

18:31.811 --> 18:32.779
IN MY LIFE.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.181
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MIMI,

18:34.181 --> 18:35.515
BECAUSE IF THEY DID EVER IN A

18:35.515 --> 18:36.683
MILLION YEARS GET MARRIED,

18:36.683 --> 18:38.651
BECAUSE STEVIE J STEPPED UP AND

18:38.651 --> 18:39.852
DID THE RIGHT THING, DO YOU

18:39.852 --> 18:40.887
THINK YOU AND JOSELINE COULD

18:40.887 --> 18:42.054
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP?

18:42.054 --> 18:43.690
THAT DEPENDS ON JOSELINE.

18:43.690 --> 18:44.891
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM

18:44.891 --> 18:45.592
BEING TOGETHER.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.593
SHE OBVIOUSLY HAS A PROBLEM WITH

18:46.593 --> 18:47.560
ME, SO...

18:47.560 --> 18:49.229
THERE SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.897
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

18:50.897 --> 18:53.700
THE PROBLEM IS, YOU ARE--YOU

18:53.700 --> 18:55.735
FEEL SOME TYPE OF WAY ABOUT ME.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.036
I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH YOU

18:57.036 --> 18:57.937
AND STEVIE J BEING TOGETHER.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.906
STEVIE AND I ARE NOT TOGETHER.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.040
I DON'T WANT STEVIE.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.175
YOU GOT HIM, HANDS DOWN,

19:02.175 --> 19:02.875
GIRLFRIEND.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.743
I DON'T--LISTEN, LET ME TELL

19:03.743 --> 19:04.544
YOU SOMETHING, MIMI.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.412
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOU

19:05.412 --> 19:06.246
BECAUSE YOU COME TO THE HOUSE

19:06.246 --> 19:07.046

19:07.046 --> 19:08.080
ACT LIKE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

19:08.080 --> 19:08.881
SPEAK TO ME.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.183
WE COULD SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER.

19:10.183 --> 19:10.983
WE COULD TALK TO EACH OTHER.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.818
WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE STARTED

19:11.818 --> 19:12.519
TALKING NOW.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.386
YOU GUYS CAN CONTINUE TALKING.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.053
WHAT?

19:14.053 --> 19:14.721
THIS IS A START.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.555
WE NEED TO GO ON A COMMERCIAL

19:15.555 --> 19:16.223
BREAK.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.023
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A BREAK--

19:17.023 --> 19:17.757
IF I BRING MY DAUGHTER TO

19:17.757 --> 19:18.425
THE HOUSE--

19:18.425 --> 19:19.158
LET'S TAKE A COMMERCIAL

19:19.158 --> 19:19.826

19:19.826 --> 19:20.493
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.261
GO TO A COMMERCIAL BREAK

19:21.261 --> 19:22.229
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK

19:22.229 --> 19:22.929
ABOUT THIS [bleep].

19:22.929 --> 19:23.896

19:30.637 --> 19:32.839
BRING MY DAUGHTER TO SEE HER

19:32.839 --> 19:35.074
FATHER, AND YOU GOT A PROBLEM

19:35.074 --> 19:36.108

19:36.108 --> 19:38.378
I--I ACTUALLY NEVER HAD

19:38.378 --> 19:39.111
A PROBLEM--

19:39.111 --> 19:39.912
YEAH, YOU DID.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.414
MIMI, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

19:41.414 --> 19:42.382
WE'VE TALKED IN GOD KNOWS

YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.755
I DON'T HAVE--LISTEN, MIMI--

19:48.755 --> 19:49.856
SHUT UP!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.724

19:51.724 --> 19:52.592
CHILL, CHILL.

19:52.592 --> 19:53.826
THIS IS GOING IN A DIFFERENT

19:53.826 --> 19:54.927
DIRECTION.

19:54.927 --> 19:55.695
HOLD ON, MIMI.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.196

19:58.631 --> 19:59.299
LET'S TAKE A BREAK.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.572
I CAN'T DWELL ON EVERYTHING

20:05.572 --> 20:06.273

20:06.273 --> 20:07.173
I GOT TO [bleep] MOVE ON.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.543
IN FRONT OF MIMI, AND IN FRONT

20:34.934 --> 20:36.269
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, MIMI.

20:36.269 --> 20:37.537
WHEN STEVIE GAVE YOU THE RING,

20:37.537 --> 20:38.938
RIGHT, AND WE SAW HER WHOLE

20:38.938 --> 20:40.206
BREAKDOWN, YOU WERE THERE

20:40.206 --> 20:40.873
FOR THAT?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.275
DID YOU FEEL VINDICATED

20:42.275 --> 20:43.443

20:43.443 --> 20:44.644
IT WASN'T A VINDICATION.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.479
IT WAS TYPICAL STEVIE J.

20:46.479 --> 20:47.780

20:47.780 --> 20:49.416
KNOWING HIM AS LONG AS I HAVE

20:49.416 --> 20:51.150
AND JOSELINE KNOWING HIM ONLY

20:51.150 --> 20:52.452
A YEAR AND SOME CHANGE.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.920
THAT'S WHY I COULD LAUGH AT IT,

20:57.324 --> 20:58.090
I KNOW.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.925
WE SAW THAT FOR SURE.

20:58.925 --> 20:59.659
I KNOW IT'S TYPICAL.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.760
I KNOW IT'S TYPICAL STEVIE J AND

21:00.760 --> 21:01.994
THAT'S NOT THE ONLY--OH, MY GOD,

21:01.994 --> 21:02.862
SHE'S--LISTEN.

21:02.862 --> 21:03.630
THAT WAS NOTHING.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.397

21:04.397 --> 21:05.532
TRUST ME AND BELIEVE, THERE'S

21:05.532 --> 21:07.166
MORE THING THAT HE'S DONE WORSE

21:07.166 --> 21:08.034
THAN THAT.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.101
IT'S JUST THAT YOU TELL ME,

21:09.101 --> 21:10.136
"OH, I WANT TO BE YOUR LIFE

21:10.136 --> 21:10.837
PARTNER."

21:10.837 --> 21:11.638
YOU PUT THE RING ON MY WEDDING

21:11.638 --> 21:12.439

21:12.439 --> 21:13.172
BUT THEN YOU GIVE YOUR BABY

21:13.172 --> 21:14.307
MOTHER A FRIENDSHIP RING.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.542
AND I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS

21:15.542 --> 21:17.176
THE MOMENT.

21:17.176 --> 21:17.977
WELL, THAT'S A VERY GOOD

21:17.977 --> 21:18.811
POINT.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.646
I MEAN, STEVIE, NONE OF THAT

21:19.646 --> 21:20.547
RESONATES FOR YOU?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.948
THE FACT THAT THAT WAS JUST

21:21.948 --> 21:22.682
HORRIBLE TIMING.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.183
HE DOESN'T GIVE A [bleep].

21:24.183 --> 21:24.851
HE DOESN'T CARE.

21:24.851 --> 21:25.585
YOU KNOW, NOT THAT MIMI

21:25.585 --> 21:26.753
DIDN'T DESERVE THAT RING AND

21:32.759 --> 21:33.693
MONA, I DON'T DESERVE

21:33.693 --> 21:34.661
THE RING.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.828
I DIDN'T WANT THE RING.

21:35.828 --> 21:36.563

21:40.299 --> 21:41.468
I'M GONNA PAWN THE RING,

21:41.468 --> 21:42.301
AND I WILL PUT IT IN THE BANK

21:42.301 --> 21:43.135
ACCOUNT FOR OUR DAUGHTER.

21:43.135 --> 21:43.803
THAT'S DOPE.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.038
I WAS GONNA DO THAT.

21:46.038 --> 21:46.939
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE GAVE

21:46.939 --> 21:47.674
IT TO ME.

21:47.674 --> 21:48.508
YOU SHOULD'VE DID THAT IN THE

21:48.508 --> 21:49.342
FIRST PLACE IF THAT'S WHAT YOU

21:49.342 --> 21:50.543
WERE GONNA DO INSTEAD OF PISSING

OFF YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.379
IT'S ALL GOOD.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.145

22:09.962 --> 22:11.130
COME DOWN TO BUSINESS AND MONEY,

22:11.130 --> 22:12.064
AND YOUR BEEF CAKE IS GREAT,

22:12.064 --> 22:12.832
BUT THAT'S IT.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.066
SO NOW--HOLD ON, HOLD ON,

22:14.066 --> 22:15.735
HOLD ON, HOLD UP.

22:15.735 --> 22:16.669
IT AIN'T THAT GREAT.

22:16.669 --> 22:17.404
BUSINESS--

22:17.404 --> 22:18.905
MIMI, DON'T LIE.

22:18.905 --> 22:19.806
IT AIN'T THAT GREAT, 'CAUSE

22:19.806 --> 22:20.873
IF IT WAS, I'D STILL BE [bleep]

22:20.873 --> 22:22.208

22:22.208 --> 22:23.075
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS CAN HAVE

22:23.075 --> 22:25.011
A CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING.

22:25.011 --> 22:25.878
I'M GLAD YOU GUYS CAN HAVE

22:25.878 --> 22:27.179
A CONVERSATION ABOUT SOMETHING.

22:27.179 --> 22:27.947
LISTEN, LET ME TELL YOU

22:27.947 --> 22:28.615
SOMETHING.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.348
LISTEN, LISTEN.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.049
I CAN'T GET NO WORDS

22:30.049 --> 22:30.717
IN THIS HOUSE.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.418
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

22:31.418 --> 22:32.251
WOULD I WANT TO HAVE A BABY

22:32.251 --> 22:32.985
FROM STEVIE?

22:32.985 --> 22:33.753
YES, I WOULD.

22:33.753 --> 22:34.821
WOULD I LIKE TO SPEND THE REST

22:34.821 --> 22:35.888
OF MY LIFE WITH STEVIE?

22:35.888 --> 22:36.556
YES, I WOULD.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.090
AND I ALWAYS SAY THIS: STEVIE

22:38.090 --> 22:39.325
DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT A

22:39.325 --> 22:40.593
WOMAN BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE

22:40.593 --> 22:42.094
A MOTHER, OKAY?

22:42.094 --> 22:43.663
OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.564
YOU DON'T.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.498
LET ME SPEAK.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.766
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A MOTHER--

22:46.766 --> 22:48.034
EVEN WITH ME, I HAVE A MOTHER,

22:48.034 --> 22:48.901
BUT SHE DIDN'T REALLY TEACH ME

22:48.901 --> 22:50.002
ANYTHING, SO IT'S LIKE,

22:50.002 --> 22:51.370
EVERYTHING THAT I GO, ANYTHING

22:51.370 --> 22:52.639
THAT I DO IN LIFE, I HAVE TO

22:52.639 --> 22:53.473
LEARN ON MY OWN.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.741
AND THEN THAT HURTS ME TOO.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.175
THAT HURTS ME, BECAUSE I DON'T

22:56.175 --> 22:58.645
HAVE NOBODY TO TEACH ME

22:58.645 --> 22:59.479
ANYTHING.

22:59.479 --> 23:00.647
AND HE KNOWS THAT.

23:00.647 --> 23:01.881
I TEACH YOU.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.850
YOU KNOW, I--HE GETS ME.

23:03.850 --> 23:04.984
YOU CANNOT TEACH A WOMAN

23:04.984 --> 23:05.752
ANYTHING.

23:05.752 --> 23:06.453
STOP IT.

23:06.453 --> 23:07.386
HOLD ON, I TEACH HER A LOT.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.387
I TEACH HER A LOT.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.088
STOP IT.

23:09.088 --> 23:09.789
I TAUGHT YOU A LOT TOO.

23:09.789 --> 23:10.657
YOU DIDN'T TEACH ME [bleep].

23:10.657 --> 23:11.390
I'M OLDER THAN YOU.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.358
IT DON'T MATTER.

23:12.358 --> 23:13.392
SHUT YOUR ASS UP.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.094
YOU DIDN'T TAKE ME FROM NOWHERE.

23:15.094 --> 23:15.762
STOP SCREAMING.

23:15.762 --> 23:16.429
I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS

23:16.429 --> 23:17.430
AND BEEN MY OWN WOMAN.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.498
YOU DIDN'T TEACH ME ANYTHING.

23:18.498 --> 23:19.532
WE GOT SOMEBODY CRYING.

23:19.532 --> 23:20.567
STOP SCREAMING.

23:20.567 --> 23:21.468
YOU MIGHT TEACH HER

23:21.468 --> 23:22.168
SOMETHING.

23:22.168 --> 23:23.002
YOU DIDN'T TEACH ME [bleep].

23:23.002 --> 23:24.036
THAT HE DOES THAT.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.337
I EVEN HATE THE FACT

23:25.337 --> 23:26.272
THAT HE DOES THAT.

23:26.272 --> 23:27.206
I MEAN, IT'S INTERESTING TO

23:27.206 --> 23:29.141
SEE--IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE

23:29.141 --> 23:30.577
HERE THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN AT

23:30.577 --> 23:32.378
SUCH ODDS BUT HERE IN THIS

23:32.378 --> 23:33.680
MOMENT, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M

23:33.680 --> 23:34.647
SAYING, YOU GUYS--YOU CAN

23:34.647 --> 23:35.748
ACTUALLY EMPATHIZE WITH WHAT

23:35.748 --> 23:36.449
SHE'S GOING THROUGH.

23:36.449 --> 23:37.283
I CAN EMPATHIZE WITH HER.

23:37.283 --> 23:37.984
YOU KNOW WHY?

23:37.984 --> 23:38.685
BECAUSE I CAME FROM

23:38.685 --> 23:39.852
THE SAME THING.

23:39.852 --> 23:40.753
I DIDN'T HAVE A MOTHER, EITHER.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.622
MY MOTHER GAVE ME UP TO A

23:42.622 --> 23:43.823
RELIGION WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS

23:43.823 --> 23:44.991
OLD, AND I WAS OUT ON MY OWN.

23:44.991 --> 23:45.858
WE HEARD ABOUT THAT, YEAH.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.426
I GET--I GET IT.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.328
I TOTALLY EMPATHIZE WITH HER AND

23:49.328 --> 23:50.262
WHAT SHE'S GOING THROUGH.

23:50.262 --> 23:53.032
WHAT IT IS, IS SHE'S A YOUNG

23:53.032 --> 23:54.467
GIRL, AND HE'S MANIPULATING HER

23:54.467 --> 23:55.735
AND [bleep] HER MIND.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.336
HE DOES.

23:57.336 --> 23:58.638
HE DOES, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

23:58.638 --> 24:00.507
HE DOES, MIMI, BUT I ALSO--I

24:00.507 --> 24:03.209
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT I CAN'T

24:03.209 --> 24:04.110
DWELL ON EVERYTHING

24:04.110 --> 24:04.977
THAT HE DOES.

24:04.977 --> 24:05.778
I GOT TO [bleep] MOVE ON.

24:05.778 --> 24:06.579
YOU GOT TO MOVE ON.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.547
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT

24:07.547 --> 24:08.781
WITH STEVIE, I STILL HAVE MY

24:08.781 --> 24:10.382
CAREER, AND I STILL HAVE--

24:10.382 --> 24:11.551
NO, I'M NOT LETTING HER--I'M NOT

24:11.551 --> 24:13.319
LETTING HER--I'M NOT LETTING HER

24:13.319 --> 24:14.120
DO ANYTHING.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.354
THIS IS NOT ABOUT MIMI.

24:15.354 --> 24:16.222
DO YOU SEE THE MANIPULATION?

24:16.222 --> 24:17.356
"DON'T LET HER GET TO YOU."

24:17.356 --> 24:18.525
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET TO HER.

24:18.525 --> 24:20.126
MIMI, LISTEN--MIMI, LET ME

24:20.126 --> 24:20.793
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.460
YOU KNOW ME.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.128
I'M THE HARDEST BITCH

24:22.128 --> 24:23.062
YOU PROBABLY KNOW, AND EVERYBODY

24:23.062 --> 24:23.863
KNOW THAT.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.197
AND I KNOW THAT HE MAKES THIS

24:25.197 --> 24:26.933
SITUATION WORSE A LOT OF TIMES,

24:26.933 --> 24:28.768
BUT IT DOES NOT MATTER, BECAUSE

24:28.768 --> 24:29.802
I'M NOT DWELLING ON WHAT

24:29.802 --> 24:30.770
STEVIE'S DOING.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.705
I CAN'T--I DON'T THINK ABOUT THE

24:32.705 --> 24:33.606
NEGATIVE [bleep].

24:33.606 --> 24:34.440
I'M THINKING ABOUT WHERE I'M

24:34.440 --> 24:35.975
GOING, SO I'M NOT EVEN THINKING

24:35.975 --> 24:37.677
ABOUT STEVIE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.579
BUT YOU DO LOVE STEVIE.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.548
YES, I DO, I DO, I DO LOVE

24:41.548 --> 24:42.348
STEVIE.

24:42.348 --> 24:43.149
SO THEN, STEVIE, I'M GONNA

24:43.149 --> 24:44.416
GIVE YOU A MOMENT HERE TO DO THE

24:44.416 --> 24:45.117
RIGHT THING.

24:45.117 --> 24:45.885

24:58.430 --> 24:59.532

28:29.708 --> 28:31.443
I'M NOT LEAVING THIS HOUSE TILL

28:31.443 --> 28:32.745

28:32.745 --> 28:33.746
WE SUPPOSED TO BE A TEAM.

28:33.746 --> 28:34.546
WE SUPPOSED TO BE ONE.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.647

28:37.349 --> 28:38.150
AT ALL.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.986
WOW.

28:39.986 --> 28:40.853
I WAS JUST THINKING THIS WAS

28:40.853 --> 28:42.755
ANOTHER BUMP IN THE ROAD.

28:42.755 --> 28:44.757
AND I'M REALIZING IT'S NOT.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.158
I WENT THROUGH YOUR PHONE,

28:46.158 --> 28:47.894

28:47.894 --> 28:49.428

28:49.428 --> 28:50.229
ONCE YOU GO LOOKING FOR

28:50.229 --> 28:51.497
SOMETHING, YOU'RE GONNA FIND IT.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.531
I'VE TAKEN IT OFF, AND I

28:52.531 --> 28:53.665
HAVEN'T PUT IT BACK ON.

28:53.665 --> 28:54.600
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.902
ENGAGEMENT OFF.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.404
RELATIONSHIP NULL AND VOID.

28:58.404 --> 29:02.308
I PAWNED THE ENGAGEMENT RING.

29:02.308 --> 29:03.175
IT WAS LOCKED UP.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.043
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE

29:04.043 --> 29:05.344
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE, DIDN'T

29:05.344 --> 29:06.745
KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD GET OUT,

29:06.745 --> 29:08.047
SO I HAD TO MAKE SURE

29:08.047 --> 29:09.882
FINANCIALLY THAT ME AND EMANI

29:09.882 --> 29:10.682
WERE GONNA BE STRAIGHT.

29:10.682 --> 29:11.517

29:11.517 --> 29:12.318

29:12.318 --> 29:14.821
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

33:31.310 --> 33:32.244
THE FREAKING HOUSE.

33:32.244 --> 33:33.145
NO, I'M--

33:33.145 --> 33:34.046
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.314
YOU TRAIN THESE [bleep] THEY

33:35.314 --> 33:36.348
DON'T OPEN THEIR [bleep] MOUTH!

33:36.348 --> 33:37.316
DO YOU THINK I WANT TO BE

33:37.316 --> 33:38.384
A BABY MAMA?

33:38.384 --> 33:39.418
YOU THINK I WANT TO LIVE

33:39.418 --> 33:40.419
THIS LIFE?

33:40.419 --> 33:41.220
LISTEN, I DIDN'T CHOOSE

33:41.220 --> 33:41.987
THIS [bleep].

33:41.987 --> 33:42.788
YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T BEEN

33:42.788 --> 33:43.822
TOGETHER IN SEVEN YEARS, RIGHT?

33:43.822 --> 33:44.656
I KNOW THAT.

33:44.656 --> 33:45.357
YOU KNOW WHAT?

33:45.357 --> 33:46.358
I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON SOMEBODY FOR

33:46.358 --> 33:47.559
A WHILE, LIKE, A COUPLE YEARS,

33:47.559 --> 33:48.794
BUT WE'VE JUST BEEN FRIENDS.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.829
BUT HE FINALLY ASKED ME OUT.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.265
I WANT TO TRUST AGAIN, AND I

33:53.265 --> 33:54.533
THINK THAT A RIGHT MAN WILL

33:54.533 --> 33:55.801
BRING THAT OUT OF ME.

33:55.801 --> 33:56.735
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW

33:56.735 --> 33:57.769
ABOUT ME, I'LL TELL YOU.

33:57.769 --> 33:58.704
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I'M

33:58.704 --> 34:00.272
SUPPOSED TO DO AS A MOTHER,

34:00.272 --> 34:01.207
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR ME

34:01.207 --> 34:02.040
TO BE HAPPY.

34:02.040 --> 34:02.908
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY

34:02.908 --> 34:03.575
WITH THAT GUY.

34:03.575 --> 34:04.610
WOW.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.445
DREW IS CRAZY TO THINK THAT I'M

34:06.445 --> 34:08.614
GONNA GO BACK WITH HIM.

34:08.614 --> 34:09.681
OH!

34:09.681 --> 34:10.782
[laughs]

34:10.782 --> 34:11.850
RIGHT NOW, I'M HAPPY WITH WHO

34:11.850 --> 34:13.185
I'M WITH, AND I DON'T WANT YOU

34:13.185 --> 34:14.586
TO TRY TO COME BETWEEN US.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.088
I GOOGLED A LITTLE BIT,

34:16.088 --> 34:17.589
AND HE DON'T LOOK TOO HAPPY

34:17.589 --> 34:18.524
IN THIS MUG SHOT THAT I'M

34:18.524 --> 34:21.427
FINDING IN 2006.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.294
WAIT. HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

34:22.294 --> 34:23.129
IS THIS REAL?

34:23.129 --> 34:24.096
YES, OF COURSE IT IS.

34:24.096 --> 34:24.896
I ASKED YOU,

34:24.896 --> 34:26.298
"SHOULD I TRUST YOU?"

34:26.298 --> 34:27.433
AND THEN YOU SAT AT THE TABLE

34:27.433 --> 34:29.101
AND YOU LIED!

34:29.101 --> 34:30.369
SO YOU'RE--YOU'RE JUST, LIKE,

34:30.369 --> 34:31.270

34:31.270 --> 34:32.238
I'M DONE.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.639
I WANT TO SEE YOU MOVE ON AND

34:33.639 --> 34:34.306
BE HAPPY.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.607
SO YOU DON'T THINK I'VE MOVED

34:35.607 --> 34:36.275
ON FROM YOU?

34:36.275 --> 34:37.609
NO, IF WE WERE TO EVER CROSS

34:37.609 --> 34:38.410
THAT LINE AGAIN,

34:38.410 --> 34:39.378
IT WOULD NOT BE GOOD.

34:39.378 --> 34:41.713
I KNOW THAT.

34:41.713 --> 34:42.648
OH, MY GOD.

34:42.648 --> 34:43.749
ALL RIGHT, WELL, TRACI,

34:43.749 --> 34:44.750
YOU SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO BE

34:44.750 --> 34:46.318
WITH DREW, BUT EVERY TIME

34:46.318 --> 34:47.186
THERE'S ANOTHER WOMAN AROUND,

34:47.186 --> 34:48.554
YOU LOSE IT.

34:48.554 --> 34:49.688
EVERY TIME THERE'S A WOMAN

34:49.688 --> 34:52.324
AROUND AND WE'RE DOING BUSINESS,

34:52.324 --> 34:53.425
IT'S SOME TYPE OF DISRESPECT.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.360
LIKE, THAT CHICK DON'T NEED TO

34:54.360 --> 34:55.694
OPEN HER MOUTH IF I'M GIVING YOU

34:57.129 --> 34:58.597
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.565
YOU DON'T OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.175
TO YOU!

35:09.175 --> 35:10.809
YOU SHOULD HANDLE THESE BITCHES.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.711
THESE MICROWAVABLE BITCHES NEED

35:12.711 --> 35:14.213

35:21.253 --> 35:22.388
WHO WOULD OPEN THE DOOR

35:22.388 --> 35:23.855

35:23.855 --> 35:25.891
[cheers and applause]

35:25.891 --> 35:27.193

35:30.862 --> 35:31.663
OF COURSE SHE HAS FEELINGS

35:31.663 --> 35:32.364

35:32.364 --> 35:33.165
DO YOU THINK SHE'S STILL IN

35:33.165 --> 35:34.466

35:34.466 --> 35:35.401
I SHOULD REACH OVER TO YOUR

35:36.067 --> 35:37.403
SIT DOWN.

35:37.403 --> 35:38.204
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SAY SOME

35:38.204 --> 35:38.870
[bleep] LIKE THAT?

35:38.870 --> 35:39.838
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS.

35:39.838 --> 35:40.639
IT'S NOT OBVIOUS.

35:40.639 --> 35:41.507
IT'S NOT OBVIOUS?

35:41.507 --> 35:42.174
NO, IT'S NOT.

35:42.174 --> 35:42.874
WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

35:42.874 --> 35:43.575
IS IT OBVIOUS?

35:43.575 --> 35:44.643

35:44.643 --> 35:46.278

35:53.252 --> 35:54.353
SO WHY DID YOU WAIT UNTIL

35:54.353 --> 35:55.554
AFTER SHE HAD STARTED DATING

35:55.554 --> 35:56.688
DESHAUN TO CONFESS THAT?

35:56.688 --> 35:58.123
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T REALIZE

35:58.123 --> 35:59.391
WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL YOU SEE

35:59.391 --> 36:00.125
