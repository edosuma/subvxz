00:37.620 --> 00:39.000
Who killed our
little brother?

00:40.100 --> 00:42.000
And who else
was involved?

00:44.915 --> 00:46.715
Fuck you.

00:51.675 --> 00:53.278
See...

00:53.520 --> 00:55.450
That's the wrong answer.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.190
I'm not telling you nothing!

01:06.775 --> 01:08.443
Fuck you!

03:28.499 --> 03:29.876
Get towels! Towels.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.421
Hey. Hey, you look at me right now.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.338
You're not
going anywhere.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.465
You look at me.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.176
Orion!

03:39.052 --> 03:40.509
I don't want to die, Ren.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.846
You're not gonna die.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.513
Orion, look at me.
You look at me right now.

03:44.515 --> 03:46.349
- You're fine.
- I'm sorry.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.936
You are fine.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.354
He's dying. We need to take
him to a hospital right now.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.733
We fucking can't!

03:54.359 --> 03:56.484
Orion! Orion!

03:56.486 --> 03:57.902
Hey, Orion!

03:57.904 --> 03:59.362
Hard to breathe.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.572
Or... Orion... Orion!

04:01.574 --> 04:02.365
Relax.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.370
Breathe. Breathe.

04:11.209 --> 04:13.309
Goddamn it.

04:15.812 --> 04:17.863
We all fucking
know, Ren, it was a set-up.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.884
We don't know that, Jesse! All we know is
the crew showed up at the same time we did.

04:21.886 --> 04:23.636
Bull! Then how the hell
do you know that?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.012
For all we know, it could've
been you that set

04:25.014 --> 04:28.400
this whole fucking thing up,
told whoever all about this!

04:28.851 --> 04:31.018
Have you lost your mind? I've been best
friends with him since grade school,

04:31.020 --> 04:33.521
not to mention I've been working
with you for quite some time.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.106
If you're gonna shoot me,
then do it right now.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.899
You haven't been fucking
working with us for that long,

04:36.901 --> 04:39.112
and you could have fucking
orchestrated the whole goddamn thing.

04:39.350 --> 04:40.830
- Stop.
- Don't tell me to stop, Ren.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.948
Fucking little brother's dead over
there, man. Don't you understand that?

04:43.950 --> 04:45.408
This ain't the time
for that shit, Jesse.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.535
Oh, yeah? When the fuck
is the time, man, huh?

04:47.537 --> 04:49.453
He could have
orchestrated the whole thing!

04:49.455 --> 04:50.538
He's right here
in the room with us.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.626
- Fucking enemy. Fuck you. You're not family.
- It wasn't me, Jesse.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.669
Relax, Jesse.
Relax, Jesse.

04:56.671 --> 05:00.548
Relax, relax, relax.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.259
Dude, calm down.
Okay, relax.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.177
Relax.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.930
Relax.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.098
No, fuck you!

05:09.100 --> 05:11.311
Don't fucking touch me!

05:38.090 --> 05:40.490
- Is this all we need?
- Yeah.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.818
You really want to take him
up to Valencia right now?

05:52.820 --> 05:54.550
- Yeah.
- Bury him where grandma was buried?

05:58.483 --> 06:00.943
All right, man.
If you say so.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.350
Why didn't you
see them walking in?

07:01.650 --> 07:03.125
We were busy.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.089
I don't know, actually.

07:05.091 --> 07:05.840
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

07:05.842 --> 07:07.925
One moment it's business
as fucking usual,

07:07.927 --> 07:10.136
and the next moment,
there's three big guys

07:10.138 --> 07:11.679
that are showing up
in black ski masks.

07:11.681 --> 07:14.473
They got fucking guns and they
open fire on me and Orion

07:14.475 --> 07:16.767
while we're fucking just there
at the cash drawers.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.562
So we start fucking firing back,
and then all of a sudden,

07:19.564 --> 07:21.732
it's just...
Blap-Blap-Blap-Blap-Blap!

07:22.550 --> 07:23.998
Everything else just
fucking goes to a blur.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.362
I don't remember anything.
What the fuck do you remember?

07:27.321 --> 07:29.738
The same thing.
Ren and I go for the vault.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.118
You and Orion go for the
cash drawers as was planned.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.850
And then what?

07:35.705 --> 07:37.248
Ah.

07:37.874 --> 07:38.664
I don't fucking know, man.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.875
Ren and I fucking...
We come out of the vault,

07:40.877 --> 07:43.669
and we see three guys
with black ski masks on,

07:43.671 --> 07:45.173
opening fire on you two.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.633
We proceed
to open fire on them.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.891
I actually popped one of them
motherfuckers, too, actually.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.600
Okay, so then you and Ren,
you guys come out of the vault,

07:57.602 --> 07:59.768
and then it's just
everybody's blasting.

07:59.770 --> 08:01.022
It's a fucking war zone, right?

08:01.650 --> 08:03.050
From what I remember, yeah.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.041
Okay, so then...

08:06.444 --> 08:07.776
Orion gets hit
and he goes down,

08:07.778 --> 08:09.864
and then these guys,
they just... what? They...

08:11.150 --> 08:15.950
They just disappear out the fucking
front door, like shortly afterwards?

08:17.538 --> 08:19.624
Yeah, from what I
remember, fucking yeah.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.625
And then we grab...
We fucking grab Orion,

08:22.627 --> 08:25.254
and we go into...
we take off in the fucking van.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.880
I didn't see
those guys though.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.551
Okay.

08:31.250 --> 08:34.263
All right, so if I'm
gonna rob a bank...

08:37.099 --> 08:38.933
I'm gonna rob a bank

08:38.934 --> 08:40.308
at the exact same bank,

08:40.311 --> 08:41.477
on the exact same night,

08:41.479 --> 08:43.520
in the exact same
three-minute window as us,

08:43.523 --> 08:47.777
and it's just gonna be us
accidentally running into them?

08:49.300 --> 08:51.781
Really? I mean, does that
make any fucking sense?

08:52.198 --> 08:52.698
No.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.017
- They know of us.
- Yeah, okay, well, how?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.450
How do they know of us, Ren?
What, like, somebody talked?

08:57.954 --> 08:58.661
Yeah, other people
knew the plan,

08:58.663 --> 09:02.542
but nobody knows our routes
except for me and you...

09:03.000 --> 09:03.918
and this fucking guy.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.795
I don't have anything
to hide, Jesse.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.454
- No, it was someone else.
- Who? Who, Ren?

09:08.456 --> 09:11.092
We're not at fucking war
with anybody else.

09:11.900 --> 09:14.011
- You need to relax.
- Yeah.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.679
I'm fucking tired of you

09:16.681 --> 09:19.267
fucking telling me
to fucking relax!

09:19.550 --> 09:21.433
I don't need to
fucking relax, all right?

09:21.435 --> 09:23.811
Our little brother
just got fucking killed.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.688
So why don't you...
I need you

09:25.690 --> 09:28.568
to please get that
through your head.

09:29.527 --> 09:30.528
I'm gonna go
make a phone call.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.948
Okay, good. Go make a phone call.
That's bullshit.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.416
So how do we
not have enemies?

09:44.575 --> 09:46.752
People are trying to
interrupt our business.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.466
Why don't you tell me? Huh?

09:53.225 --> 09:55.511
I mean, obviously
we do have enemies.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.375
It's basic economics, Gage.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.500
There are crews out there
and they are watching us,

10:02.600 --> 10:04.000
and they are seeing
the kind of cash

10:04.103 --> 10:07.898
that we are pulling from the kind of
fucking jobs. And so what are they doing?

10:08.359 --> 10:10.733
They're gonna take out
the fucking competition.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.361
Right? I mean, uh...

10:14.530 --> 10:17.325
Isn't that why
you snitched us out?

10:19.215 --> 10:20.515
Jesse...

10:22.575 --> 10:24.749
I need you to stay cool.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.215
You need me to stay cool?

10:33.635 --> 10:36.383
Ren needs me
to fucking relax.

10:36.385 --> 10:37.650
I'm fucking fine.

10:37.970 --> 10:42.016
All right, why don't you
give me the fucking room, Gage?

10:46.437 --> 10:49.607
Why don't you give me
the fucking room, Gage?

10:52.777 --> 10:54.445
You got it.

11:02.703 --> 11:04.870
Yeah, we can talk all about
that when you get here.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.416
See you then.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.129
Ren, what are we doing?

11:13.297 --> 11:15.049
Got Jerry coming over
to help us out.

11:16.467 --> 11:19.426
Yeah, Tony's boy. Ren, that
dude ain't reliable, man.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.388
- Well, he was in the past.
- Yeah, that was for something totally different than this

11:22.390 --> 11:23.933
and you fucking know it!

11:32.775 --> 11:33.734
Well, look, listen.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.193
He's got good connections,
all right?

11:36.195 --> 11:38.487
He can find just about
anybody in the city.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.863
All right, so then
what are we doing?

11:39.865 --> 11:42.074
We're gonna wait and then
we're just gonna send Jerry

11:42.076 --> 11:45.204
- on a wild fucking goose chase through downtown LA?
- No.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.207
I'll have him pull security
cameras from the bank.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.793
Might just tell us
something about these guys.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.753
I mean, the motherfucker
does know every single

11:54.755 --> 11:57.717
corrupt son of a bitch
in Los Angeles, so...

12:00.845 --> 12:01.429
I'm serious.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.974
Motherfucker did some back
research for me a few years ago.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.435
He's fucking reliable.

12:08.185 --> 12:09.393
Yeah, well, we'll see

12:09.395 --> 12:11.647
'cause I'm not still
sure about the guy, Ren.

12:13.691 --> 12:17.278
Look, I agree with you, Ren.
I think we should check him out.

12:20.781 --> 12:22.116
What?

12:24.034 --> 12:27.134
Yo, man, if anybody knows
who these guys are,

12:28.247 --> 12:32.668
or could fucking find out,
it is Jerry, and you know that.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.919
Yeah, the last time that you gave
advice on something, you were wrong.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.087
So you're actually
the last person

12:37.089 --> 12:38.589
that should be giving
advice on anything.

12:38.591 --> 12:39.673
Why don't you go
pick a fucking lock?

12:39.675 --> 12:41.635
- And you leave the thinking to me and my brother, huh.
- Listen, that's enough.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.974
Now, look, I'm gonna run down to the
street to the house and get the supplies.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.059
Jerry will be here
in about an hour or so.

12:50.311 --> 12:53.647
Whoa, whoa. You are not leaving
me here with this guy, huh?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.025
Yeah.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.796
It wasn't fucking me.

13:09.455 --> 13:11.415
You want to be useful, Gage?

13:12.541 --> 13:13.832
Help me gather up
a couple of chairs

13:13.834 --> 13:15.448
and go into the next
fucking room

13:15.450 --> 13:18.998
because I guarantee you
that Jerry's gonna want

13:19.000 --> 13:20.841
to have a little sit
and a chat with each one of us.

13:21.133 --> 13:21.633
Good.

13:22.885 --> 13:24.885
- Fucking looking forward to it.
- Good, yeah.

13:24.887 --> 13:28.641
You make sure you got your
fucking story straight, Gage!

13:29.950 --> 13:32.061
You fucking stay cool, Jesse.

13:32.175 --> 13:34.385
Fucking always lippy,
motherfucker...

13:45.074 --> 13:47.241
Uh, hey, man, um...

13:47.243 --> 13:48.953
Yeah?

13:53.249 --> 13:56.293
Look, that shit from earlier,
sorry about that.

14:02.485 --> 14:04.385
Look, Jesse...

14:05.636 --> 14:08.138
I know we're not blood,
but we're brothers.

14:09.598 --> 14:12.059
So I need you
not to sweat that.

14:18.232 --> 14:20.734
Nah, you're family, man.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.443
You've been
fucking good to us.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.322
You've been loyal.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.199
It's just we had
everything planned out.

14:29.201 --> 14:32.746
You know? And then, these guys,
they show up and they...

14:33.330 --> 14:35.040
Shake everything loose,
and then...

14:35.300 --> 14:37.835
Boom,
they get the drop on us.

14:39.850 --> 14:41.625
We didn't know.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.218
How we supposed to know that they're
coming in while we're leaving?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.514
Then Orion gets shot.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.602
It's all wrong.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.226
I'll tell you that.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.607
See, man, see that's why
it's gotta be a set-up.

15:00.730 --> 15:02.107
Those guys, I mean,
they showed up

15:02.109 --> 15:03.998
and they were ready
to handle business.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.945
I mean, the masks, the guns. They didn't
just want the money that we wanted.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.657
No, they...

15:10.640 --> 15:12.661
Hell, they wanted us dead.

15:17.565 --> 15:20.252
Then we have enemies
we don't know about.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.465
Yeah.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.925
I mean, yeah,
there's plenty of crews

15:27.927 --> 15:30.135
out there that want
the jobs that we take

15:30.137 --> 15:32.890
because of the money
that we make, but...

15:33.307 --> 15:34.681
They can't do
what we do, man.

15:34.683 --> 15:37.483
They can't do it
in under three minutes.

15:42.325 --> 15:45.402
I had everything
planned out, man, like...

15:46.850 --> 15:49.436
We had everything
planned out.

15:52.952 --> 15:53.909
All right, listen up.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.537
Jesse's gonna
explain everything.

16:01.680 --> 16:04.380
All right, guys,
this is what we got.

16:05.510 --> 16:06.610
It's a bank job,

16:06.882 --> 16:08.582
and everybody's gonna
be going in on this one.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.385
Orion, you're gonna be the
wheel man there and back.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.306
You're gonna park the van on the
southeast side of the bank.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.184
Now, guess what, guys. It's
also gonna be a night job.

16:17.559 --> 16:18.850
Ren and I were
talking about it.

16:18.852 --> 16:19.935
It's just gonna be the best
time to hit this bank.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.604
There's less foot traffic and
there's less chance of us

16:22.606 --> 16:24.106
running into somebody
with a gun.

16:24.108 --> 16:28.408
Now, with that being said, there is
an on-duty armed security guard.

16:29.339 --> 16:30.737
Now, the good news is,
he takes a single

16:30.739 --> 16:33.450
15 minute break for lunch,
so we're gonna go then.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.660
All right? And everybody's gonna
go armed, just like always.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.912
It's a safety precaution.
Gage, Ren,

16:38.914 --> 16:39.955
you guys go for the vault.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.873
Orion and I,
we go for the cash drawers

16:41.875 --> 16:43.475
and that's it.

16:45.775 --> 16:46.575
Wait a second.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.588
What about disabling
the security cameras

16:48.590 --> 16:49.965
beforehand, like we usually do?

16:49.967 --> 16:52.167
Yeah, we're just not
gonna be able to.

16:53.137 --> 16:54.261
The fastest
response time

16:54.263 --> 16:55.887
that the police have
for a bank,

16:55.889 --> 16:57.264
when an alarm
has been triggered

16:57.266 --> 16:59.141
in that area, is just
under three minutes.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.810
So guess what? That's
exactly what we've got.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.978
We've got under
three minutes.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.023
You got to believe me, bro.
I've timed it before.

17:05.648 --> 17:08.150
- And if we get separated?
- Jesus Christ.

17:08.152 --> 17:08.952
Let the man finish.

17:09.444 --> 17:12.154
You mean if the cops
show up while we're there,

17:12.156 --> 17:13.488
everything goes to shit.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.117
We got to abort
the whole thing?

17:15.451 --> 17:16.867
Yeah, cops show up,

17:16.868 --> 17:18.367
some of us
go out the front,

17:18.369 --> 17:19.368
the other go out the back.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.539
There's a lot of things
that can go wrong.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.915
Exit number one
is gonna be the front entrance.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.348
The second exit
is gonna be the fire exit,

17:26.349 --> 17:28.800
and that's also on the
southwest side of the bank.

17:29.882 --> 17:30.922
Now, if for some reason,
if we don't make it

17:30.924 --> 17:34.009
to either of those or
everything goes to shit,

17:34.011 --> 17:37.003
we meet at the local
7-Eleven in the alley,

17:37.005 --> 17:39.765
which is about eight blocks
northwest of the location.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.017
Orion, if you can
grab the van, then grab it,

17:42.019 --> 17:43.852
and if not,
then don't worry about it.

17:43.854 --> 17:46.273
VIN number's been removed.
We got it covered.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.194
What time's all this
going down tomorrow?

17:50.819 --> 17:52.446
It's gonna be 1:30
in the morning, man.

17:55.725 --> 17:56.625
Is that it?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.701
Yeah, I mean,
that's all I've got.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.163
Ren, did I leave
anything out?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.873
No.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.416
We good?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.045
I'm good.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.213
Yeah, we good.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.130
All right,
that means we're good.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.093
So let's prep and let's
make some money.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.600
Where's Jesse?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.803
Hey, what's up?
Did you...

18:59.805 --> 19:01.723
find what you
were looking for?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.725
- Yeah, food and water.
- Okay, so is that it?

19:05.727 --> 19:07.853
- Yeah.
- All right, so what's next?

19:07.855 --> 19:10.607
We wait.
He'll be here soon.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.201
- Can I get a drag of that?
- No.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.329
You'd think that this guy would
know to show up on time.

19:26.456 --> 19:28.350
It's Jerry.
You know how he is.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.213
Is this him?

19:33.490 --> 19:34.490
Fellas!

19:34.798 --> 19:36.198
It's been a while.

19:39.636 --> 19:40.637
Good to see you.

19:41.305 --> 19:43.513
Man, I heard about
what happened.

19:43.515 --> 19:44.515
Yeah.

19:44.952 --> 19:47.352
Yeah, you guys
have my condolences.

19:48.687 --> 19:49.521
Where's Ren?

19:49.980 --> 19:52.107
He's inside.
Just follow me this way.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.065
Ren.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.703
It's good to
see you, brother.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.621
Sorry for your loss.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.872
How you holding up?

20:08.874 --> 20:10.250
It's just another day.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.214
Fellas...

20:16.381 --> 20:18.965
Ren told me what
happened over the phone,

20:18.967 --> 20:20.008
and I just want to say,

20:20.010 --> 20:23.180
I want to do anything
I can to help you guys out.

20:23.950 --> 20:25.515
That's why I'm here.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.518
Gage, how about you?
What's new, brother?

20:28.685 --> 20:30.435
Aw, man, just saving
up money to get my kids

20:30.437 --> 20:32.022
out of the
fucking neighborhood.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.483
Aw, that's right.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.777
You still living
on the south end, right?

20:36.860 --> 20:38.485
Yeah, I hate it, man.
I hate it.

20:38.487 --> 20:39.236
I'm trying to get
'em to college,

20:39.238 --> 20:40.338
trying to get...

20:41.865 --> 20:43.533
Yeah, trying to
take care of my kids, man.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.576
They're a handful.

20:44.660 --> 20:47.913
Yeah, I hear you. I got
two myself, four and six.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.665
Them rascals are a handful.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.333
Yes, they really are.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.960
Shit.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.378
Ren, anything
new with you?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.546
- Nothing.
- Yeah?

21:00.825 --> 21:01.660
Damn.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.221
It's been a while, fellas.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.266
When was the last time
we hung out?

21:08.433 --> 21:12.018
A couple months
ago at that sports bar

21:12.020 --> 21:14.104
where that fat
red-headed, cross-eyed kid

21:14.106 --> 21:15.313
was trying to pick
a fight with you.

21:15.315 --> 21:16.665
Yeah, yeah.
No, I remember that.

21:17.317 --> 21:19.567
Ren had a couple of...
too many drinks that night.

21:19.569 --> 21:22.239
And he got up from the table
and he knocks this chair over,

21:22.925 --> 21:25.448
and it hits the glass, and it
goes spilling all over the table.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.911
It ends up going over this
dude and his date, right?

21:28.453 --> 21:30.996
But then somehow the guy decides
that he's gonna start blaming me

21:30.998 --> 21:32.872
for not paying my bill,
when the two things,

21:32.874 --> 21:34.793
they weren't
connected whatsoever.

21:35.752 --> 21:36.418
Yeah, but you're forgetting

21:36.420 --> 21:38.044
that this was just
a poor college kid, man,

21:38.046 --> 21:41.300
just at the bar getting a beer,
trying to impress this lady.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.592
And you forget that he was also
trying to act like a hard-ass,

21:44.594 --> 21:46.138
and I hate that shit.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.723
What don't you hate?

21:48.765 --> 21:52.185
Yeah, sure, but he was trying to act
hard, all right, and I hate that shit.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.563
You know what was crazy,
though, was how a girl that hot

21:56.565 --> 21:58.734
was with a dude
that looked like him.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.026
That's 'cause he was
paying her bills, man.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.111
Shit. You remember him and his
boy at the end of the night?

22:03.113 --> 22:05.113
Okay, Jesse, you're right.
They were challenging us.

22:05.115 --> 22:06.990
They were at the entrance
when we were walking out,

22:06.992 --> 22:08.408
putting their chests
all out, trying to act

22:08.410 --> 22:10.000
- like they're fucking hard and shit.
- Yeah.

22:10.245 --> 22:12.871
Did you see me walk out of the
bar and go up to those two guys,

22:12.873 --> 22:14.414
look 'em right in the eyes?
You know what they wouldn't do?

22:14.416 --> 22:15.957
They wouldn't look me in the eye.
You know why?

22:15.959 --> 22:17.542
Because they were scared.
They didn't want nothing.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.630
I should've just knocked the dude's teeth
out right then, just based on principle.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.298
I remember she was
super transfixed on you.

22:23.300 --> 22:24.966
Nah, man, she was
looking right past me.

22:24.968 --> 22:28.928
She had her eyes on Orion. Ladies
always had their eyes on Orion.

22:28.930 --> 22:31.350
All right, that's enough.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.300
Hey, my bad, Ren.

22:35.175 --> 22:36.175
Sorry.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.898
It's business now.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.983
Well, it goes
without saying, guys.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.568
You guys are
pretty much fucked.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.988
Yeah, you think?

22:47.199 --> 22:48.116
It was a set-up.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.411
Okay, see, that's
what we thought too.

22:52.621 --> 22:53.870
So, I'll tell you what,

22:53.872 --> 22:56.041
here's what I can
do for you guys.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.540
As you guys know,

22:57.542 --> 22:59.542
I pretty much know all the
major players in this city.

23:00.300 --> 23:01.836
So I don't think it'll
be too hard to find out

23:01.838 --> 23:03.588
who hit you guys up
at the bank,

23:03.590 --> 23:06.134
but I do have
a few questions.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.302
Which bank
was it, again?

23:08.804 --> 23:10.729
It's, um, Westland
Bank on Fourth.

23:11.306 --> 23:13.266
- The one in downtown?
- The only one.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.522
And then, the guys
that hit you up...

23:19.425 --> 23:22.025
Did they have any tattoos or
markings or anything like that?

23:22.734 --> 23:23.944
They were covered.

23:24.569 --> 23:26.863
Do you remember how tall they were?
Height? Build?

23:27.030 --> 23:31.074
Uh, first guy's
6'2", 220-230.

23:31.076 --> 23:35.578
The next guy is about
5'6", 180-185.

23:35.580 --> 23:41.209
Third guy:
5'8 "-5'9", 200-220?

23:41.211 --> 23:42.502
I...

23:42.504 --> 23:44.089
It's a guess.

23:46.007 --> 23:46.466
Okay.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.554
Do you remember how many
cameras and where at the bank?

23:52.722 --> 23:56.101
Three at the entrance,
over near the cash drawers.

23:56.560 --> 23:58.560
And then two looking
at the vault door,

23:58.562 --> 24:00.311
three inside the vault.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.314
Excellent.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.523
Hey, one of my guys
can break into

24:03.525 --> 24:05.861
pretty much any bank camera
there is in the city.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.177
I'll give him
a call tonight.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.363
Make a few calls
with guys on the streets.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.615
If I come up with anything,
I'll be in touch,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.411
which should be soon.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.246
Good to go?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.957
Yes, one more thing.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.331
When you do
find these guys,

24:20.333 --> 24:22.584
you just go ahead
and you bring 'em right here.

24:22.586 --> 24:24.796
- Okay?
- Man, don't worry about it.

24:25.589 --> 24:27.255
Ren knows what
I'm capable of.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.426
Do I look worried?

24:32.095 --> 24:33.305
Gage, anything else?

24:34.139 --> 24:36.099
Just let us know
what you find out.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.435
Ren, anything?

24:40.437 --> 24:42.105
No.

24:43.815 --> 24:45.982
Well, all right,
I'll be in touch.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.569
Good seeing you guys.

24:48.653 --> 24:50.361
Thank you. I'm sorry that we
didn't have more for you.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.657
- Hey, no worries. It's good catching up.
- Thanks, man.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.657
Ren, again, I'm sorry
for your loss, brother.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.703
- Thanks.
- I'll be in touch.

25:28.276 --> 25:30.876
Gentlemen,
how've you been?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.955
You're here to see
Fredrick, aren't you?

25:34.925 --> 25:36.175
Come in.

25:47.028 --> 25:48.926
So this place
or bank you know of,

25:48.928 --> 25:50.596
what exactly is involved?

25:50.832 --> 25:52.375
How much money?

25:52.825 --> 25:55.025
About two million dollars.

25:55.500 --> 25:57.050
And how do you guys
plan on doing this?

25:57.550 --> 25:59.747
Well, we pull up
in your van

25:59.749 --> 26:01.448
and then we go in,
we hit the vault,

26:01.450 --> 26:03.753
and then we hit the cash
registers, and then we get out.

26:04.025 --> 26:06.980
We do it at nighttime while the
security guard's on break,

26:06.982 --> 26:10.160
and then we do all of this
in under three minutes.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.403
Okay, good.

26:11.946 --> 26:13.444
If I'm lending you
one of my vans,

26:13.446 --> 26:14.821
I want a cut
of the money.

26:14.823 --> 26:15.863
- That's fine.
- So how much?

26:15.865 --> 26:19.200
Good question. You guys
still owe me from the past.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.827
How about 25 percent?

26:20.829 --> 26:23.540
- I don't know about...
- It's fine.

26:24.291 --> 26:25.041
Okay, good.

26:25.333 --> 26:28.543
When you get the money, we can meet
somewhere so I can get my cut.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.963
Now, I've trusted you
in the past, Ren.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.758
Don't fuck me
on this one, man.

26:34.342 --> 26:36.845
All right, what else?

26:37.345 --> 26:38.955
I'm good.
Just let me know

26:39.055 --> 26:41.558
within the next week the time
and date this is gonna go down.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.893
So I can give you the van.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.061
All right.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.186
You got Gage
still with you?

26:47.188 --> 26:48.315
How's he working out?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.857
He's good.
He's a hard worker.

26:50.859 --> 26:52.027
He's all right.

26:53.111 --> 26:54.652
That's good to hear.

26:54.654 --> 26:57.073
Glad things are going well.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.815
So everyone knows
what to do, right?

27:32.817 --> 27:33.483
Yeah, Ren, we got it.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.318
We go in. We grab the money.
We get out.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.071
It's super simple.
You guys go for the vault.

27:38.073 --> 27:38.863
We go for the cash drawers,

27:38.865 --> 27:41.366
and we're in and out
in less than three minutes.

27:41.368 --> 27:43.868
Yeah, really there's nothing
else to it, man.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.123
If we do run into
that security guard...

27:47.615 --> 27:48.657
Just gotta take him out.

27:48.767 --> 27:51.294
I'll take care of
any would-be heroes.

27:52.545 --> 27:55.213
And everyone knows what to do
if we get separated?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.315
- Yeah, Ren, we got it.
- Mm-hmm.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.178
Where we gonna
stash the money afterwards?

28:01.805 --> 28:02.805
I got a place for it.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.639
Goddamn it,
all right, we've got it!

28:04.641 --> 28:06.432
We've done this
a million fucking times.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.810
Okay, we go in, we grab
the money, we get out.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.978
Let's just make this run
as smoothly as possible,

28:10.980 --> 28:13.066
and everybody gets home
and everything's good, right?

28:13.483 --> 28:15.151
All right, right.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.457
You expecting someone?

28:30.208 --> 28:32.085
It's probably Helen.
I told her what happened.

28:49.018 --> 28:49.811
Who is it?

28:50.270 --> 28:52.480
Helen and Violet.

28:54.482 --> 28:55.565
What the hell
is going on?

28:55.567 --> 28:56.983
What the hell
are you doing here?

28:56.985 --> 28:59.028
Ren talked to Helen
and told her what happened.

29:12.959 --> 29:14.753
What the hell
were you guys thinking?

29:16.546 --> 29:17.922
Did I invite you over?

29:18.673 --> 29:19.674
You're an ass, Ren.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.883
You always have them
doing these stupid jobs

29:21.885 --> 29:24.051
and that's why you guys
are in the spot you're in now.

29:24.053 --> 29:27.597
First off, no one gave you
permission to come over here,

29:27.599 --> 29:29.056
so you're lucky
that Ren let me know

29:29.058 --> 29:30.975
that it was gonna be you,
Helen, at the front door, okay.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.727
And secondly,
don't you ever

29:32.729 --> 29:34.439
talk to my brother
like that again.

29:35.231 --> 29:36.773
You're an asshole, Jesse.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.318
What? Come here.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.200
What did you do?

29:46.826 --> 29:47.994
I didn't do anything.

29:49.078 --> 29:50.830
You're unsafe, Ren.

29:51.664 --> 29:53.124
Orion is dead.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.792
These little stupid
business deals

29:55.794 --> 29:58.171
are the reason
he's not here anymore.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.088
And for what?

30:01.090 --> 30:02.717
For money, lady.

30:03.301 --> 30:04.509
What'd you think?

30:04.511 --> 30:06.721
As you said,
this is a fucking business.

30:07.555 --> 30:10.225
It ain't our fault that
Orion ain't here no more.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.450
Oh, fuck you, Gage.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.730
You guys are screwed up.
You don't think straight.

30:21.653 --> 30:22.862
Look, I'm sorry.

30:23.571 --> 30:24.570
That was rude.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.323
I'm sorry.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.448
Just trying to
explain the situation

30:27.450 --> 30:29.577
to our friend Helen
over here.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.833
Don't ever
ask me for help...

30:36.376 --> 30:37.476
For anything.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.559
What else is there to talk about?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.145
Well, you tell me. You're the one
that came all the way over here.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.564
Why'd you get into
the car with her?

30:58.565 --> 30:59.774
Because...

31:00.775 --> 31:01.941
She told me
what happened.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.528
I didn't think
it was true at first.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.447
It bothers me.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.033
How did he get shot?

31:09.909 --> 31:11.494
Normal way, with a gun.

31:12.370 --> 31:13.286
All right, look, I'm sorry.

31:13.288 --> 31:14.664
Okay, we were going
into the bank

31:15.415 --> 31:17.292
and we grabbed the money,
and we were on our way out.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.168
And these guys came in with ski
masks, took us by surprise.

31:21.170 --> 31:23.462
And Orion, he got, um...
He got shot,

31:23.464 --> 31:24.632
and he went down.

31:25.884 --> 31:26.759
All for what?

31:27.886 --> 31:28.968
How much money?

31:28.970 --> 31:31.139
We're talking
10 million dollars, babe.

31:32.098 --> 31:33.723
Was it really worth it?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.391
Yeah, it was
worth the risk, okay?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.395
We didn't know Orion
was gonna get shot.

31:38.062 --> 31:39.772
This whole damn thing's
been a set-up.

31:40.690 --> 31:42.064
A set-up with who, Jessie?

31:42.066 --> 31:43.065
I don't know, all right?

31:43.067 --> 31:44.777
That's... We don't
have any idea.

31:46.654 --> 31:48.197
So what do you guys
plan to do?

31:48.615 --> 31:50.740
Well, we've got
a guy working on it.

31:50.742 --> 31:51.743
Okay, you know Jerry?

31:52.160 --> 31:53.951
All right, he was here
a little bit ago,

31:53.953 --> 31:55.753
and he's doing
some footwork for us.

31:56.122 --> 31:58.791
He knows the business. He's gonna
lean on a couple of people.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.087
Then what? You're gonna
go after these people?

32:03.671 --> 32:06.005
You're gonna end up dead, Jesse, if
you keep going on with all this.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.965
Okay, look, I know
that you're concerned.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.800
All right, I do.
I appreciate that.

32:09.802 --> 32:11.387
That's very, very
sweet, okay?

32:12.639 --> 32:14.307
This is my business.

32:14.807 --> 32:17.060
Okay, and you got
to trust me, okay?

32:18.353 --> 32:22.148
I should have caught on to this stubborn
attitude you have when we first met.

32:23.358 --> 32:25.109
You just never listen
to anyone but Ren.

32:25.777 --> 32:28.363
Babe, he's my brother.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.114
Okay?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.742
I'm going to find Helen.

32:36.913 --> 32:39.415
Babe. Babe.

32:44.379 --> 32:47.004
I cannot believe that. Yeah,
go ahead and hang out with Helen.

32:47.006 --> 32:50.510
Shows up to where I'm trying to get
my thing done. You know what I mean?

32:50.969 --> 32:52.510
All these broads, I don't
know what's wrong with them.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.886
You know what I'm saying? Each
and every single one of them,

32:53.888 --> 32:56.000
they start out
as a princess. Right?

32:56.140 --> 32:58.224
But they always seem to be a queen.
You know what I mean?

32:58.226 --> 32:59.850
They got all these answers
and all these solutions.

32:59.852 --> 33:01.519
None of them make sense,
none of them are logical,

33:01.521 --> 33:03.688
but yet, they're gonna fucking
tell you what they are exactly.

33:03.690 --> 33:05.272
Do I tell them what to do
with their nails?

33:05.274 --> 33:06.401
Do I tell them what to do
with their hair?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.985
What are they fucking doing
telling me about my business?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.778
Showing up to where we're
trying to get shit done,

33:10.780 --> 33:14.158
- And they're telling me about my business.
- Hey. Hey. Shut up.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.370
You talk too much. You never
shut your fucking mouth.

33:17.704 --> 33:19.622
Why don't you sit
down and relax for once?

33:25.878 --> 33:27.797
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

33:43.438 --> 33:45.604
He's obviously a little
high-strung right now, man.

33:45.606 --> 33:46.274
It's fine.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.235
He ain't gonna tell us
or show us, but...

33:51.654 --> 33:53.156
That's Ren.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.700
Yeah, well, this whole
bank job was his idea, right?

33:57.702 --> 33:58.617
We shouldn't even
be in this situation

33:58.619 --> 34:00.538
- and he knows it.
- Jesse, don't do that.

34:00.997 --> 34:01.996
We all planned
this together.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.417
What happened to Orion,
it's none of our faults.

34:05.168 --> 34:06.502
Don't start that.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.761
So what'd your
girl say, anyway, hmm?

34:15.553 --> 34:16.637
Weren't you listening?

34:17.138 --> 34:18.137
It was a bunch
of madness as always.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.973
She's just running her mouth like
she knows what she's talking about,

34:20.975 --> 34:22.893
but it's just a bunch
of shit flying out of her mouth.

34:24.937 --> 34:27.938
I mean, she seemed
a little crazy, but...

34:27.940 --> 34:28.790
I like crazy,

34:29.692 --> 34:31.692
but she absolutely seems
off her fucking rocker.

34:31.694 --> 34:34.027
Yeah, well, she is off her rocker.
The rocker's right here,

34:34.030 --> 34:35.696
and then the porch is, like, right
here, and then she's like...

34:35.697 --> 34:37.989
just... she's like somewhere over here.
She's nuts.

34:37.992 --> 34:39.659
Yeah, I can tell, man.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.873
Aw, thank you.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.431
So what now?
What are we gonna do, Ren?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.267
We wait for Jerry.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.312
Okay.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.357
I get that.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.942
So what happens when
he brings these guys here,

35:12.944 --> 35:14.570
if he brings these
guys here?

35:15.363 --> 35:16.612
We force answers
out of them.

35:16.614 --> 35:18.241
And how do you
plan on doing that?

35:22.161 --> 35:24.163
Well, how the hell
do you think, Gage?

35:24.875 --> 35:25.913
We're gonna beat it
out of them

35:25.915 --> 35:27.873
until they tell us
what we want to hear. Okay?

35:27.875 --> 35:30.126
And if these guys
are the guys that were involved,

35:30.128 --> 35:32.421
then their bodies are gonna
get dumped in a nearby river.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.216
We wait for Jerry.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.799
We get our answers.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.219
We get out of town.

35:45.434 --> 35:47.687
How the fuck do we know they're
not on their way in right now?

35:48.479 --> 35:49.647
We don't.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.065
God, for Christ's sake, man.
Nobody knows about this place,

35:53.067 --> 35:55.025
all right, unless we
actually brought them here

35:55.027 --> 35:56.193
or told them
that we were here,

35:56.195 --> 35:57.738
then nobody knows
that we're here.

35:57.947 --> 35:58.797
Okay.

35:59.824 --> 36:01.224
I mean, that's
what you say,

36:01.617 --> 36:05.911
but what I'm saying is, they could
be on their way here right now,

36:05.913 --> 36:07.957
and they could know
it was us at the bank.

36:09.625 --> 36:10.270
Huh?

36:11.419 --> 36:13.794
Look, I'm not going
anywhere, okay,

36:13.796 --> 36:15.590
until I know
who killed Orion.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.840
And there's a lot more
dangerous people

36:17.842 --> 36:19.925
that are looking for us
than just the cops.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.385
Somebody knew
where we were gonna be

36:21.387 --> 36:24.015
and they knew the exact time
that we were gonna be there.

36:24.307 --> 36:26.809
Look, look.
We wait for Jerry.

36:27.226 --> 36:29.478
We handle business
and we get out of town.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.856
All right, Ren.

36:33.900 --> 36:35.109
It's your call.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.921
Is that Jerry?

37:44.720 --> 37:45.805
Who is that?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.642
Shit.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.403
Hey, what's going on?

38:08.661 --> 38:10.538
I got some info
for you guys.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.334
Damn, you guys
look like shit.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.211
You guys haven't
slept at all, huh?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.212
Well, I was

38:18.921 --> 38:20.673
until your ass came
and woke me up.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.172
Well, that's good

38:22.174 --> 38:23.426
'cause we got
a lot of work to do.

38:23.509 --> 38:25.177
What do you got
for us, Jerry?

38:25.636 --> 38:26.887
Let me show you.

38:39.859 --> 38:41.277
Well, gentlemen, shall we?

38:45.114 --> 38:46.490
Wait a minute.
Where's Ren?

38:47.742 --> 38:48.492
Oh, there you are.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.661
What's going on, brother?
Good to see you.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.792
Jesus Christ.

38:58.127 --> 39:00.338
You guys are some
melancholic motherfuckers.

39:00.755 --> 39:01.922
Why isn't anyone talking?

39:02.590 --> 39:03.966
What do you got
for us, Jerry?

39:06.218 --> 39:08.471
Anyways, I got
some good news.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.015
I got two suspects
for y'all.

39:11.849 --> 39:12.725
Check it out.

39:15.311 --> 39:16.685
Remember that tech guy

39:16.687 --> 39:18.689
in my crew
I told you guys about?

39:19.607 --> 39:21.690
Well, he was able to access

39:21.692 --> 39:24.236
the surveillance footage
from the bank you guys hit.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.988
It turns out...
you're not gonna believe this...

39:27.990 --> 39:31.325
he was able to identify
the fucking scar

39:31.327 --> 39:33.162
on the tall one's
right hand.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.082
This is Diego Hernandez.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.832
Apparently, there's
only one guy in the city

39:38.834 --> 39:40.086
with a scar like his.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.633
This guy is Cyrus Dixon,
Diego's right-hand man.

39:46.509 --> 39:47.758
Word on the street is

39:47.760 --> 39:50.429
wherever Diego goes,
Cyrus goes.

39:50.846 --> 39:51.914
So I'm pretty certain

39:52.014 --> 39:54.058
Cyrus is one of the guys
that hit you up as well.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.893
Oh, yeah, the third guy's
still a mystery man,

39:57.895 --> 39:59.355
but I'm still
working on it.

39:59.939 --> 40:02.272
So then you are not
100 percent certain

40:02.274 --> 40:05.069
about this Cyrus guy?
Is that right?

40:06.153 --> 40:07.986
Well, technically
not 100 percent,

40:07.988 --> 40:10.030
but I'm pretty goddamned
certain he was there

40:10.032 --> 40:11.409
because Diego was there.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.911
Okay, so...

40:14.412 --> 40:15.285
How do we get these guys

40:15.287 --> 40:18.207
and then what exactly can
you do to help us out?

40:18.791 --> 40:20.582
Oh, I got my guys
scouting these two

40:20.584 --> 40:21.834
right now as we speak.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.880
It shouldn't be too hard to pick
them up and bring them here.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.424
So... How exactly
do you plan

40:28.426 --> 40:30.951
on picking them up
and bringing 'em here?

40:31.512 --> 40:33.971
Hey, man, don't worry about that.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.182
You know how I do it.

40:38.060 --> 40:39.145
But it's like a gang, right?

40:39.728 --> 40:40.478
I assume,

40:41.647 --> 40:43.566
since y'all gonna need
an army to pick 'em up.

40:44.191 --> 40:47.901
Yeah, well, they are
a low-level, dip-shit crew,

40:47.903 --> 40:49.530
but they do
run about 20 deep.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.988
Oh, that's great, okay.

40:51.866 --> 40:55.202
So we've got like 20 guys
that are going after us then?

40:56.370 --> 40:57.580
Yeah, pretty much.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.332
And how are you
keeping 'em off of your ass?

41:01.584 --> 41:02.877
Well, that's the thing.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.212
They're not expecting me,

41:06.172 --> 41:08.839
but once I pick up
Diego and Cyrus

41:08.841 --> 41:09.925
and they go missing,

41:10.468 --> 41:12.634
their crew is gonna
be suspecting you guys.

41:12.636 --> 41:14.054
Oh, without a doubt.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.598
It's true.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.143
Okay.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.353
So this, uh...

41:22.229 --> 41:25.230
Diego Hernandez guy,
like what?

41:25.232 --> 41:27.401
Is he the leader
of their crew?

41:28.319 --> 41:30.905
What makes you think that
he's gonna be easy to get to?

41:31.447 --> 41:33.197
Nah, I'm not too
worried about him.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.409
He's just a mid-level foot
soldier, not too bright.

41:36.076 --> 41:38.162
And what do you want
in exchange from us?

41:39.622 --> 41:40.789
Nothing, brother.

41:41.123 --> 41:42.500
I'm just trying
to pay you back.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.336
Oh, but, guys,
do me a favor.

41:45.878 --> 41:49.548
Keep my involvement
with this hush-hush.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.093
It's not a problem, man.
We're not gonna say anything.

41:54.178 --> 41:55.095
Right on.

42:01.393 --> 42:02.228
We're good.

42:03.395 --> 42:04.146
Right on.

42:05.564 --> 42:06.999
Well, I'll be in touch

42:07.399 --> 42:08.943
when I got something
to deliver to you guys.

42:09.568 --> 42:11.362
- Ren, we good?
- We're good.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.197
All right.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.199
- Hey.
- Hey, man, thanks for your help.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.036
- Yeah, no. No worries.
- Thank you.

42:48.482 --> 42:49.900
So what do you think?

42:52.695 --> 42:54.530
There's no other
options I know of.

42:55.614 --> 42:57.614
Okay, but do you
think he's gonna do

42:57.616 --> 42:59.868
what he says
he's gonna do?

43:00.619 --> 43:01.493
No,

43:01.495 --> 43:03.122
but there's no
other options, as I said.

43:06.875 --> 43:07.918
All right, man.

43:09.628 --> 43:11.255
If you say so.

43:12.798 --> 43:13.966
All right.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.760
I'll be in
the other room, fellas.

45:05.536 --> 45:06.954
It's two tens.

45:08.789 --> 45:09.996
It looks like two pair.

45:09.998 --> 45:12.650
Ooh. Yeah, gentlemen,
thank you

45:12.876 --> 45:14.876
for allowing me to
take your money.

45:14.878 --> 45:17.129
That's trip-five
right there, gentlemen.

45:17.131 --> 45:19.172
Bup, bup, bup, bup.
I'm sorry.

45:19.174 --> 45:20.676
I'm new to the game. Um...

45:21.218 --> 45:22.676
What do they call it?

45:22.678 --> 45:23.528
Pocket aces! Oh!

45:24.471 --> 45:26.304
- Take the pot, take the pot.
- Is that good?

45:26.306 --> 45:28.974
I hate you. Yeah, no, it's very good.
I'm proud of you.

45:28.976 --> 45:31.435
- I'm going to Vegas, baby.
- Yeah, well, you're gonna learn

45:31.437 --> 45:34.104
and lose everything
that you just took in Vegas.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.049
- Lose?
- Lose.

45:35.149 --> 45:37.901
Have you not just been here?
I don't lose, my man. I win.

45:38.944 --> 45:40.988
Vegas... Vegas is a
different game there.

45:42.197 --> 45:43.824
Vegas is a
different game there.

45:43.866 --> 45:44.616
Let me tell
you something.

45:45.075 --> 45:47.242
I spend a max of $40
when I go to Vegas.

45:47.244 --> 45:48.869
- Forty dollars?
- Forty dollars.

45:48.871 --> 45:49.995
I'm serious, man.

45:49.997 --> 45:53.000
- Hand to God, 40 bucks.
- Right, how?

45:53.375 --> 45:54.958
Wouldn't you like to know?
Don't worry about how.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.754
All right, just learn
how to play cards.

45:57.171 --> 45:59.588
I'm actually really curious.
I want to hear this.

45:59.590 --> 46:03.969
- I bet you are.
- Yeah, I want to hear this.

46:04.470 --> 46:05.471
Yeah?

46:06.472 --> 46:07.681
The big man has spoken.

46:08.432 --> 46:09.514
All right, well, first of all,

46:09.516 --> 46:13.187
soon as a I get there, I hit the
liquor store right away. Right?

46:14.396 --> 46:15.596
I get a cheap
bottle of booze.

46:15.981 --> 46:18.899
- Nothing too cheap, but, you know, cheap enough.
- Yeah.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.443
Then hit the strip,
meet a hot older lady,

46:21.445 --> 46:22.944
you know, classy though,

46:22.946 --> 46:25.234
you know, charm her naturally.

46:25.407 --> 46:27.532
Most women her age
find me irresistible.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.827
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:28.911 --> 46:29.911
And because of that fact,

46:30.537 --> 46:33.040
she then pays for my chips
for the rest of the night.

46:33.248 --> 46:35.081
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.958
I'm serious, man.

46:39.046 --> 46:41.463
Then I'm posted up at the
poker table like a big shot,

46:41.465 --> 46:43.465
and they're bringing me
free booze all night.

46:43.467 --> 46:46.676
All right, well,
I really do love you, man,

46:46.678 --> 46:49.473
but you are a fucking
drunk and a liar.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.308
Because the last two times
that you was in Vegas,

46:53.310 --> 46:54.895
we was right
there with you.

46:57.564 --> 46:58.864
- Hello?
- Your point being?

46:59.525 --> 47:02.444
My point being that you were
fucking passed out at 10:00 PM.

47:02.736 --> 47:04.154
Yeah, well,
it's Vegas, right?

47:04.696 --> 47:06.406
Nobody's supposed
to be coherent in Vegas.

47:06.448 --> 47:08.240
Listen...

47:08.242 --> 47:09.284
Guys, say whatever you want,

47:10.744 --> 47:12.454
but on a more serious note,

47:13.121 --> 47:14.373
and I mean this,

47:15.749 --> 47:18.001
we're all gonna make
a lot of money off this job,

47:19.002 --> 47:20.379
enough to live off forever,

47:20.629 --> 47:23.757
leave town,
and more importantly,

47:23.966 --> 47:25.634
leave this fucking business.

47:26.468 --> 47:28.134
I don't know about you guys.

47:28.136 --> 47:29.888
I don't want to
be doing this forever.

47:30.389 --> 47:32.724
I want to have kids,
you know, a family.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.058
Amen to that.

47:35.060 --> 47:36.950
So please, all of us,

47:38.021 --> 47:41.400
let's play our cards right
and get it done safe.

47:42.067 --> 47:45.445
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

48:07.634 --> 48:08.934
What's up, big brother?

48:10.762 --> 48:12.556
- You good?
- I'm good.

48:13.015 --> 48:14.683
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.141
Simple and easy, right?

48:16.143 --> 48:18.268
Just like last time,
in and out.

48:18.270 --> 48:19.470
Under three minutes.

48:19.980 --> 48:21.563
Nothing more,
nothing less.

48:21.565 --> 48:23.915
- Right.
- I don't know.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.776
Jessie... he doesn't
seem sure on this one.

48:26.778 --> 48:27.613
I don't know why.

48:28.947 --> 48:30.282
He's always like that.
He's fine.

48:30.616 --> 48:31.742
Yeah?

48:33.160 --> 48:33.994
Well, if you say so.

48:34.661 --> 48:36.246
- Are you ready to do this?
- Let's do it.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.624
Let's get out
of this town, brother.

48:52.220 --> 48:54.681
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Clean.

48:55.307 --> 48:56.391
What's up, boys?

48:58.602 --> 48:59.311
Oh, man.

49:00.187 --> 49:01.939
I was over at Short Stop's
the other night.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.147
You remember Mrs. Cooper
from down the street?

49:04.149 --> 49:05.317
- Crazy Mrs. Cooper?
- Hm-hmm.

49:05.692 --> 49:07.653
Well, I ended up
meeting her daughter,

49:08.362 --> 49:10.072
fucking hot,
smoking hot.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.741
Crazy as a fucking
lab-house rat, but hot.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.911
We're hanging out, having
a few shots, whatever.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.036
All of a sudden, she tells
me she wants to try Ecstasy.

49:18.038 --> 49:19.537
She says she's never
done it before.

49:19.539 --> 49:21.389
She says she wants to do it
for her first time with me.

49:21.833 --> 49:26.046
So, of course, I get on the phone.
I start calling everybody, man.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.299
The whole city's dry. I can't
find a pill to save my life.

49:29.841 --> 49:31.424
So I call Vinnie.
You remember Vinnie?

49:31.426 --> 49:32.761
- Vinnie and Leah?
- Oh, yeah.

49:33.512 --> 49:34.680
So he's in Vegas,

49:35.138 --> 49:37.472
but he's got
an emergency stash

49:37.474 --> 49:38.765
in his front yard:

49:38.767 --> 49:40.767
a soda bottle
filled with pills,

49:40.769 --> 49:41.812
buried under a rock.

49:42.187 --> 49:44.020
Hey, man, I'm gonna
call the kids, yeah?

49:44.022 --> 49:46.425
Yeah, okay.
So, all right, he said,

49:46.525 --> 49:48.775
"Yeah, just take the money,
put it in the bottle,

49:48.777 --> 49:49.985
take whatever
pills you need."

49:49.987 --> 49:52.237
Great. So I tell the girl.
Now she's like

49:52.239 --> 49:53.989
a fucking kid
on Christmas, right?

49:53.991 --> 49:55.573
She can't keep
her hands off me.

49:55.575 --> 49:57.160
We're headed there
immediately.

49:57.953 --> 50:00.620
So get the GPS,
get to the address...

50:00.622 --> 50:02.080
the address
that he gives me...

50:02.082 --> 50:04.525
get there,
and there's not one rock.

50:04.626 --> 50:07.170
There must be 15 of 'em, spread
out all over the whole yard.

50:07.504 --> 50:08.800
Right? So I call him.

50:08.922 --> 50:11.049
No answer, so I just start
flipping and digging.

50:11.967 --> 50:13.299
And nothing. I'm digging.

50:13.301 --> 50:14.900
I'm up to my
fucking elbows, man.

50:15.178 --> 50:17.347
You would've thought I was trying
to, like, break out El Chapo.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.515
The yard is a complete mess.
I'm getting pissed.

50:20.517 --> 50:21.891
I'm digging with anger,
you know what I mean?

50:21.893 --> 50:24.545
I'm diggin' in... eh...
There's piles of dirt,

50:24.646 --> 50:27.605
flipped over rocks. She's
yelling, "Did you find it yet?"

50:27.607 --> 50:29.107
Fucking-A.

50:29.901 --> 50:33.238
There's an old woman, I notice, all of
a sudden, looking at me, freaked out.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.490
She's going,
"George! George!"

50:35.866 --> 50:37.866
And then here
comes some old guy.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.535
Man, he just comes
out of nowhere, enraged.

50:40.537 --> 50:42.454
"What are you doing
to my lawn?"

50:42.456 --> 50:44.706
This fucking...
I went to the wrong house.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.541
You went to
the wrong fucking house?

50:46.543 --> 50:49.002
I should've known.

50:49.004 --> 50:50.672
It was way too nice
for Vinnie.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.715
He's freak...
I don't know what to do.

50:53.717 --> 50:56.317
I'm just... I'm frozen.
I'm on my hands and knees.

50:56.845 --> 50:58.386
This guy... seriously, man,
you should've seen...

50:58.388 --> 51:01.016
It was like "Caddy Shack" with all
the holes all over the place.

51:01.266 --> 51:03.183
I'm freaked out.
I don't know...

51:03.185 --> 51:04.517
I gave him
a Christopher Walken.

51:04.519 --> 51:08.440
I said, "I don't know.
I lost my watch in your yard.

51:09.149 --> 51:11.026
Apologies,
I'll send you a bill."

51:11.735 --> 51:12.400
He said, "What?"

51:12.402 --> 51:13.902
I said,
"See you later, asshole,"

51:13.904 --> 51:16.281
and fucking ran off.
I didn't know what to do.

51:16.698 --> 51:18.948
The girl's yelling...
Vinnie finally texted me.

51:18.950 --> 51:20.577
He lives on
North Orange Grove.

51:21.661 --> 51:23.244
I get to his place.

51:23.246 --> 51:24.621
Boom, dig four inches,

51:24.623 --> 51:26.539
one rock, boom,
it's right there.

51:26.541 --> 51:27.375
No problem.

51:29.252 --> 51:30.251
It didn't work out anyway.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.503
The girl ended up
getting sick.

51:31.505 --> 51:33.213
I'm holding hair above
the toilet all night.

51:33.215 --> 51:36.051
Didn't even get laid.
Fucking disaster.

51:37.219 --> 51:39.135
Uh, Jesus Christ, Orion,

51:39.137 --> 51:39.719
that's, uh...

51:39.721 --> 51:43.014
that's the saddest
fucking story I ever heard.

51:43.016 --> 51:44.518
Yeah, fucking sad story
is right.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.477
Hey, if this job goes right,
it'll be the last

51:47.479 --> 51:49.104
fucking sad story I ever tell.

51:49.106 --> 51:49.940
Here we go.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.400
Let's go
get into character.

51:53.026 --> 51:54.778
Fucking Mrs. Cooper, huh?

56:03.401 --> 56:06.027
- Yeah.
- I'll be there in a few minutes.

56:06.029 --> 56:07.030
All right.

56:17.374 --> 56:18.666
Cyrus, huh?

56:19.084 --> 56:20.208
Yup.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.169
This is him.

56:21.961 --> 56:23.213
Where'd you
find this guy?

56:23.505 --> 56:24.422
At his house.

56:25.173 --> 56:26.132
Found out where he lived.

56:26.257 --> 56:27.550
How'd you
figure that out?

56:28.343 --> 56:29.177
Google.

56:33.681 --> 56:35.934
Well, it looks like you guys
tuned him up pretty good.

56:37.018 --> 56:38.019
Yeah.

56:38.645 --> 56:39.477
The little fucker put up

56:39.479 --> 56:40.897
a pretty good fight,
actually.

56:44.484 --> 56:45.652
Let's bring him inside.

56:56.121 --> 56:57.412
It's like looking
into a mirror,

56:57.414 --> 56:58.914
but it's just so much worse.

56:59.791 --> 57:02.041
See, you were the guys
at the Westland Bank downtown

57:02.043 --> 57:03.378
and you came in
shooting at us,

57:03.878 --> 57:05.336
and you killed
my little brother Orion.

57:05.338 --> 57:08.174
You see that is the shit
that I can't forgive!

57:28.153 --> 57:29.112
Are you gonna talk?

57:29.946 --> 57:32.282
Fuck you!

57:33.408 --> 57:34.951
Huh?

57:38.413 --> 57:41.124
- Gage, hold him down.
- Uh-huh.

57:44.836 --> 57:47.255
Ooh, whew.

57:50.133 --> 57:52.091
- Fuck all of you!
- Hey, we got all day and all night

57:52.093 --> 57:54.177
to get our answers.
What do you want to do, huh?

57:54.179 --> 57:56.306
He's gonna make it
harder on himself.

57:58.516 --> 58:00.185
He's not gonna talk.
Place him on the fucking ground.

58:48.149 --> 58:50.026
Why didn't you
shoot him, Ren?

58:54.864 --> 58:56.447
Do you know
what I'm asking you?

58:56.449 --> 58:58.616
All you did is you thwacked him on
the head with the butt of a gun.

58:58.618 --> 59:00.745
That wouldn't kill a dog.
So, yeah, he's still in there.

59:01.037 --> 59:02.956
He's still breathing
and he's still alive.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.501
Shut up.

59:10.588 --> 59:11.506
All right, look.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.008
Even if Jerry is not
100 percent certain

59:16.010 --> 59:19.011
that this dude was
with Diego and the other guy,

59:19.013 --> 59:20.682
he still needs to be gone.

59:22.225 --> 59:24.308
All right,
it is blood for blood time,

59:24.310 --> 59:26.479
and I know that
he runs with them.

59:28.106 --> 59:29.897
If Jerry doesn't
bring this other dude,

59:29.899 --> 59:31.693
all we have is
this guy for answers.

59:35.154 --> 59:38.322
Okay. So what? This guy's
not gonna say anything.

59:38.324 --> 59:39.448
He would have already.
You said that.

59:39.450 --> 59:40.868
Those are your words.

59:41.578 --> 59:43.788
This guy had his chance. Let's just
get rid of him, Ren.

59:46.416 --> 59:47.792
We wait.

01:00:06.185 --> 01:00:08.646
I hope you know what you're doing,
bro', because I'm at a total loss.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.237
There he is.

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.531
Diego,
what's up, my man?

01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:20.533
How you doing, brother?

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:24.662
Everything good? What's the
latest of the greatest?

01:00:25.538 --> 01:00:28.166
Same shit. You?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.084
Just like you, my boy,

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.837
trying to make some money
and enjoy my freedom.

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:34.253
Yeah, how long
you been out, now?

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:36.549
Ten years, man, can
you believe that shit?

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:38.509
Where did you
do your bid again?

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:40.970
Eastern State Pen
in Philadelphia.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:43.264
Oh, okay.

01:00:43.848 --> 01:00:46.643
So you glad to be
in the sunny weather, huh?

01:00:46.750 --> 01:00:49.187
Ah, you know, it has
its pros and cons.

01:00:50.605 --> 01:00:51.580
Yeah, well, um,

01:00:52.106 --> 01:00:53.733
what can I do
for you today?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:55.701
You wanted to meet.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:58.446
Straight to the point.
I like that.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.030
Check this out, man.

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:03.242
I know these youngsters doing
a bank job in a few weeks,

01:01:03.701 --> 01:01:05.450
a bank in downtown
called Westland Bank.

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:08.496
There's $10 million in cash
they're gonna be taking,

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:10.164
and I want you
and your boys to go in there

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.460
and intercept the shit
out of that money.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.287
Hmm. And how do
you know these guys?

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:19.384
Met 'em at the pool hall
shooting the shit with Joe.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.426
We've all done
business together.

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:24.347
- You know, we're all good.
- Right.

01:01:25.139 --> 01:01:27.723
Well, why not just
get into the bank ourselves

01:01:27.725 --> 01:01:30.017
and forget even trying
to run into these dudes?

01:01:30.019 --> 01:01:32.687
- Don't that make sense?
- Because they have access

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:33.854
to the vault where
all the cash is at,

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:35.775
and they can get in
and out of there quick.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:37.443
Let me tell you
something, man.

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:40.277
There's no one in the city
that has a set of skills

01:01:40.279 --> 01:01:41.989
and can move as fast as them.
You feel me?

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:45.783
So you want them
to go in and grab the money,

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:48.454
and you want us to come
in and clean up the mess.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:50.246
Yeah, pretty much.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.747
What's in it
for me and my guys?

01:01:51.749 --> 01:01:54.293
- What do you want?
- Man, what does everybody want?

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:55.920
A portion of the money.

01:01:56.337 --> 01:01:57.380
How much?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.340
What can you offer?

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:02.885
I can offer you and
your boys 20 percent.

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.431
Nah, I'm gonna have
to think about that one.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.682
- How about 30?
- Well, you sure as fuck

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:11.769
- Didn't think about it too long.
- Hmm.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.563
Fuck.

01:02:16.023 --> 01:02:17.817
I can do 30,
but that's it.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.279
All right.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:22.864
Thirty it is.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:24.131
Very good.

01:02:25.283 --> 01:02:27.535
It's gonna make us
a shit load of cash, my man.

01:02:42.175 --> 01:02:44.427
Cyrus.

01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:51.400
Mmm.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.775
Don't want you
catching a cold, man.

01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:03.279
So why don't you just
tell us who shot Orion?

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.031
Hmm?

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.826
You make yourself suffer.

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.827
Listen.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.216
I already know you were
at the robbery...

01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:26.803
And I already know
that you took shots at us.

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.305
So if I were you,

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.350
I'd man the fuck up
and tell me.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.062
I don't know who shot him.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:37.980
Hmm.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.826
I believe you...

01:03:52.286 --> 01:03:53.621
But it doesn't matter.

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:55.373
Maybe it was you.

01:03:56.457 --> 01:03:58.793
Maybe it was Diego Hernandez.

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:02.672
Maybe it was that third
motherfucker that I shot.

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:07.969
Same thing.

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.680
The only thing
that matters...

01:04:13.474 --> 01:04:15.393
Is that we've all
come together here

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.645
to figure this shit out.

01:04:20.231 --> 01:04:22.275
And we have a lot
of work to do, man.

01:04:24.068 --> 01:04:25.570
We have a lot
of work to do.

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:29.907
I'll be seeing you.

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.452
Hmm.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.206
Mmm!

01:04:45.798 --> 01:04:47.550
Ren told me everything
over the phone.

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.760
Fredrick knows as well.

01:04:50.219 --> 01:04:51.886
He tells me who
you have in there

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.679
locked up in some room
and you're trying

01:04:53.681 --> 01:04:55.100
to get him to confess
to killing Orion.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:57.852
Oh, yeah? What else did Fredrick tell you?
Is that why you came here?

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:01.272
What the hell are you guys thinking, huh?
Have you lost your mind?

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:03.731
That guy you have in there
is an important member

01:05:03.733 --> 01:05:06.110
from the Eastside
territories of the city.

01:05:06.527 --> 01:05:08.112
And he has ties
with many people.

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:10.070
Well, here's the thing.

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.824
I don't really give a shit
who he rolls with.

01:05:12.658 --> 01:05:13.784
Well, you better.

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.660
These guys will come
looking for you

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:18.664
and will unleash hell
on all of you.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:20.191
Good.
You know why?

01:05:20.291 --> 01:05:21.957
I'm gonna be waiting
right there for 'em

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:23.500
because they started
a war with the wrong people.

01:05:23.502 --> 01:05:25.713
That war started the moment
they killed my little brother.

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:28.591
There you are.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.244
You're an idiot
and ignorant,

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:33.260
and you don't listen
to what I'm telling you.

01:05:33.262 --> 01:05:35.000
So I am telling
your brother here,

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:38.225
but he doesn't seem too smart
either and isn't listening.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:39.683
What is it that
you want from us?

01:05:39.685 --> 01:05:41.775
I am trying to save
your lives, God damn it!

01:05:41.979 --> 01:05:43.646
Oh, God, what are
you really here for?

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:46.108
I mean, tell me exactly
what it is that you want?

01:05:47.693 --> 01:05:49.779
Well, if you really
want to know,

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:52.281
Fredrick wants
his cut of the money.

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:55.616
There wasn't any money
because we got

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.326
into a shootout
as we were leaving the job.

01:05:57.328 --> 01:05:59.747
- We got a little fucking preoccupied with...
- Bullshit!

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.583
You can tell Fredrick
to call me about the money.

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:04.193
He doesn't care
to talk to you.

01:06:04.293 --> 01:06:06.835
- He just wants his cut.
- I don't give a shit about his cut.

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.213
If he wants his cut, then he can
call Ren or he can call me,

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.842
and we will happily fucking
discuss business with him.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.680
Well, then, if you don't
want to give me his portion,

01:06:17.682 --> 01:06:20.893
and that's what you have
decided, I will tell Fredrick.

01:06:21.852 --> 01:06:25.481
Look, if I were you,
I would leave town now.

01:06:26.190 --> 01:06:27.733
That man you have in there

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.194
is an important member
from the Eastside,

01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:34.740
and his guys as sure as hell
will come looking for you.

01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:36.715
I'm just giving you
a fair warning.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.745
Well, thank you,
but we don't need it.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.166
Okay. Okay.

01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:46.834
I wish you both
the best of luck.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:47.920
Thank you.

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:52.047
I don't give a shit
what she says.

01:06:52.049 --> 01:06:53.340
I don't give two shits
about Fredrick.

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.676
If he wants his money, then he can
fucking come by here and get it.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.678
And as far as Cyrus' crew
goes, if they want Cyrus,

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.348
they fucking can
come here too!

01:07:00.307 --> 01:07:01.100
Fuck!

01:07:01.809 --> 01:07:02.977
Let's get back inside, man.

01:07:14.947 --> 01:07:16.032
What's up?

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.326
- Who was that?
- Allena.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:26.165
- Well, I guess it was. What'd she want?
- Nothing.

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:28.085
She's running her fucking
mouth like she always does.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.172
Yeah.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.925
Listen, I tried talking to the
dude in there, and, uh...

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.596
- He ain't giving an inch.
- Of course.

01:07:44.977 --> 01:07:46.020
Fuck.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:49.732
Oh, yeah.

01:07:51.108 --> 01:07:52.318
Ow.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.405
Look, man, that dude
in there, he was involved.

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.907
He just doesn't want
to rat out his friend,

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.161
and I can respect that
I can even admire that,

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.203
but that dude would've
been gone a long time ago

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:10.002
- if it wasn't Ren that was calling the shots.
- Oh, I know it, but...

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.279
Ren calls the shots.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.260
Yeah, thank you for reminding me.
I'd forgotten.

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.683
I guess now we just wait
for fucking Jerry.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:34.068
Yo, what's the deal
with you and Ren?

01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:36.194
Why are we doing
this shit for free?

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:40.991
Shit, man.

01:08:42.576 --> 01:08:43.993
You really want to know?

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.580
I mean, we ain't
going anywhere.

01:08:49.457 --> 01:08:50.584
Well...

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:54.044
Let's just say Ren
helped me out big time

01:08:54.046 --> 01:08:55.548
about five years ago.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:00.758
I had the goddamn
Chinese, the Russians

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:03.178
and the Armenians after me.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.350
- Whoa. Heavy hitters.
- Yeah.

01:09:07.350 --> 01:09:08.435
So... So what happened?

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:13.983
Well...

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.649
Oh, shit, here he is.

01:09:15.651 --> 01:09:18.696
Yo.

01:09:22.198 --> 01:09:23.783
All right, cool.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.662
Yeah, just continue
to keep an eye on him.

01:09:27.287 --> 01:09:27.953
Mm-hmm.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.665
Yeah, we'll be there soon.

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.207
I'll be in touch.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:33.127
All right.

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:36.839
You got him?

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:38.966
Yup.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:40.316
It's Diego.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.803
He's at the Diamond Bar
on 8th and Stewart.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.014
- Is he alone?
- Yup.

01:09:45.973 --> 01:09:47.808
Let's light this
motherfucker up.

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:51.353
In due time, my friend,
in due time.

01:09:57.651 --> 01:09:59.236
Yo, I don't want
to be that guy,

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:03.741
but I haven't been paid
in a couple weeks.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.996
Hey, listen, man. I'm gonna
pay you next week, all right?

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:15.169
Bro, I got
to pay my rent.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.588
I need this money.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:21.300
What the fuck
did I just say?

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:24.426
I said I'll pay
you next week!

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:25.721
Now shut the fuck up.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.598
All right, let's roll.

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:29.850
Excuse me?

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:32.561
Listen, motherfucker:

01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:34.102
we roll when I say we roll.

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:35.648
Is that fucking clear?

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.150
Got it.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:41.528
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:43.572
Jesus Christ.

01:10:58.254 --> 01:11:00.214
Ren, fellas.

01:11:01.465 --> 01:11:03.365
- You guys already know Tony.
- Ren...

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.342
This is one of
my new guys, Adrian.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:06.671
- How's it going?
- Good, you?

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.139
Jerry told me about the situation.
I wanted to help out.

01:11:10.557 --> 01:11:11.700
I know you.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:16.647
Used to run a business with Troy,
huh, a side hustle, back in the day.

01:11:17.773 --> 01:11:19.024
Yeah, I know Troy.

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:20.442
He used to
look out for me,

01:11:20.985 --> 01:11:23.028
paid a lot of money on the side
with Hector and Reuben.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:26.407
It's been a long time
since I've seen those guys.

01:11:27.324 --> 01:11:29.618
Last I heard,
Troy had to leave town,

01:11:30.077 --> 01:11:31.576
had a death wish
on his back

01:11:31.578 --> 01:11:33.539
with some guys from
the Southside of the city.

01:11:34.248 --> 01:11:35.833
That does not
surprise me one bit.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.627
Yeah, well, he wasn't
the smartest guy,

01:11:38.836 --> 01:11:40.296
- if you know what I mean?
- Yeah.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.923
He owed a lot of people
a lot of money.

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:44.631
There's only so much time

01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:46.427
where people can
take that bullshit.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:47.819
Anyways...

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:51.432
Well, Ren, I got something
you might want to check out.

01:11:58.814 --> 01:11:59.898
Damn.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:01.525
Y'all fucked him up.

01:12:04.611 --> 01:12:07.154
Uh, we found him
by himself at his usual bar,

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.907
picked him up
not too far from there.

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:13.368
I see you guys
tuned him up pretty good,

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:14.288
just like the other guy, huh?

01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:15.998
Yeah, pretty much.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.167
Anyone see you
tune this guy up?

01:12:18.751 --> 01:12:19.626
Nope.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:21.837
It went real clean.

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:23.696
One punch, one knock out,

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.966
picked him up,
threw him in the trunk.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:27.150
Real smooth.

01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:28.675
Well,
we'll take it from here.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.593
Thanks for
all your work, man.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.596
- Anything we can do to repay you?
- No, no, we're good.

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.057
Like I said before,
I'm just scoring things

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:37.102
- up with Ren.
- Well, thanks, man.

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.395
Hey, yeah.

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.600
Hey, look,
before I go though,

01:12:40.939 --> 01:12:42.356
you guys sure you
don't want any help

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.609
questioning little Diego, here?

01:12:43.817 --> 01:12:45.611
I, uh, kind of miss
doing that kind of work.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:48.779
- We got it.
- And if you need us for anything,

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:49.740
you know how to reach us.

01:12:50.449 --> 01:12:51.992
Yeah, yeah, no problem. Will do.

01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:53.992
Well, he's all yours.

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:56.622
All right, boys, have fun
with that piece of shit.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:58.955
I'm gonna grab his arms.
You grab his legs.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:13:00.292
Oh, yeah.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.592
Take him out.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:14.306
Come on.

01:13:35.619 --> 01:13:36.662
Hey!

01:13:38.163 --> 01:13:39.331
What's going on, bro?

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.876
Which of you fucks
killed my little brother?

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.211
Yeah, sorry, you see
we were the other guys

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:47.548
from the Westland Bank downtown,

01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:50.050
and then you guys show up
and you fucking shot at us!

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:57.766
You see we need answers.

01:13:58.684 --> 01:13:59.766
So are you gonna tell me
what I want to know

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:02.561
or are you gonna be like your bitch friend
in there and tell me fucking nothing?

01:14:10.237 --> 01:14:11.780
That shit's funny, huh?

01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:16.660
He ain't gonna talk either.

01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:20.581
I got something for him.

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:26.253
Get the fuck off me!

01:14:27.087 --> 01:14:29.381
- Get the fuck off me!
- It's going down.

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:33.510
- You first...
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:34.052 --> 01:14:35.343
- ...Him second...
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:37.306
- ...and bitch last.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:42.394
Get off me!

01:16:19.157 --> 01:16:20.492
You gonna talk now?

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.500
No.

01:16:30.502 --> 01:16:32.460
I know you got more.

01:16:32.462 --> 01:16:34.673
- More?
- That's it.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:37.593
Stop.

01:16:39.219 --> 01:16:40.262
Hold him down.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.105
Bandage him up
so he doesn't bleed out.

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:59.383
Yeah, that's good.

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:03.428
All right, so what
are you thinking, huh?

01:18:04.137 --> 01:18:05.428
You want to give him
a minute to think it over

01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:07.641
- and then come back in and finish him off?
- Yeah.

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:10.725
Gage! Gage!

01:18:10.727 --> 01:18:12.104
Let's get this other
fucking guy.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:16.460
Ren doesn't want
to give you the money.

01:19:16.835 --> 01:19:18.001
Him and his brother
Jesse said

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.088
they never got the money,
which I know is a lie.

01:19:21.465 --> 01:19:24.176
- When did you see them?
- I already told you.

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:27.469
They didn't want to hand over
the money when I asked them,

01:19:27.471 --> 01:19:29.681
and said they never
got the money.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:32.309
Did they say anything
about Cyrus?

01:19:32.976 --> 01:19:34.019
Yeah.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.980
Ren did over the phone
before I went there.

01:19:37.981 --> 01:19:40.148
You know, I never saw
Cyrus while I was there,

01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:43.028
but I know they have him
somewhere in the warehouse.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.823
At least that is what Ren
told me on the phone.

01:19:48.325 --> 01:19:50.786
- So they do know about him.
- Yeah, they know.

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.789
I told them, and I told them
that they are fucking crazy.

01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.165
They know
where he's from.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.002
Well, I don't give a shit about
Cyrus, Diego, and their crew.

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:01.261
The money is my concern.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.674
I know. That is why I
went there for you.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:10.597
What else did Ren say
about the job?

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:13.115
Nothing really...

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:15.602
More than what
he told me on the phone.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:18.853
He said that when they
went there to do the job,

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:20.105
and were grabbing the money,

01:20:20.732 --> 01:20:22.982
Cyrus and the two guys
you hired came in the back.

01:20:23.401 --> 01:20:26.071
Then they start shooting at Ren,
Jesse, and the rest of them.

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.237
His brother was killed

01:20:27.239 --> 01:20:29.324
and they never
walked out with the money.

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:34.663
Cyrus and the two
other guys were guilty of it.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:36.665
That's it.

01:20:37.624 --> 01:20:38.915
Well, I know they
grabbed the money.

01:20:38.917 --> 01:20:39.876
Ren's not that dumb.

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.418
If I have to go
to his warehouse myself

01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.256
and get my money,
that's what I'm gonna do.

01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:49.219
Or just get someone
else to do it.

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:51.763
Like who?

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:53.932
I have someone in mind.

01:20:55.725 --> 01:20:57.894
I'll just give Ren
and his boys a few days.

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:00.355
Good.

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:17.914
Hey, wake up.

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:21.877
Wake up!

01:21:31.344 --> 01:21:33.388
Oh, fuck.

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:38.518
Oh, man, how long
you been here?

01:21:39.269 --> 01:21:40.645
A few days.

01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:45.901
Wow, man, what the fuck
did they do to you?

01:21:46.151 --> 01:21:48.695
Heh, what does
it look like?

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:51.406
Where'd they find you?

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.034
At my house.
And you?

01:21:54.951 --> 01:21:56.367
Pulled up in this
piece of shit ass car,

01:21:56.369 --> 01:21:58.330
hopped out, starting
whooping my ass.

01:21:59.205 --> 01:22:00.914
It was an Asian guy
and two others.

01:22:00.916 --> 01:22:01.917
Not these guys.

01:22:02.667 --> 01:22:04.669
It's the last thing
I remember.

01:22:05.128 --> 01:22:06.838
Yeah, same here.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:15.303
So, I take it these guys
are the motherfuckers

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.057
we got into it
with at the bank.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:18.558
Yeah, that's them.

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:20.560
At the bank,
they had masks on,

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.771
but the guy we shot
was their brother.

01:22:24.689 --> 01:22:26.191
Really?

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:28.068
Well, fuck 'em.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:29.817
They should all be dead,

01:22:29.819 --> 01:22:31.446
along with their
punk-ass brother.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.862
That's what I'm saying.

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:33.814
It was a fair fight.

01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:35.784
It ain't like they
didn't all shoot back.

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:38.411
Yeah, but fuck 'em.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.872
Next time,
they better kill me.

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.458
Check it out, though.

01:22:46.586 --> 01:22:47.712
I got two.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.005
My man.
Oh, shit.

01:22:51.007 --> 01:22:51.881
Look, the next time

01:22:51.883 --> 01:22:53.969
they try to come here
and do some shit,

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.802
I'll shank one,

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:56.804
you hit the other,

01:22:57.347 --> 01:22:58.647
and I'll take care
of the third.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.267
Yeah, man, we got
to get out of here.

01:23:03.269 --> 01:23:04.187
Fuck!

01:23:04.604 --> 01:23:05.687
We should have
taken them out

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:07.190
when we had a chance
at the bank.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:08.900
I know, right?

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:14.072
The one guy, the buffer one with
the Pee-Wee Herman haircut,

01:23:14.739 --> 01:23:15.530
he's the head of the pack.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:16.990
The other two are
just his little bitches.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.411
- So take him out first.
- I got you, I know.

01:23:22.622 --> 01:23:23.790
Damn, man.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:25.616
When we were in the bank,

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:28.503
why didn't we grab
the money, though? Fuck!

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.188
I know it.

01:23:31.715 --> 01:23:34.551
See, but look. These guys
have some motherfucking heat.

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.595
All we had was some
pistols that your boy gave us.

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:39.973
Think about it.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.933
We would've been rich

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:43.226
and left the city,

01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:45.770
and Fredrick
wouldn't have got shit.

01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:52.358
Look, see, everything
was going good with the plan,

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.317
then all of a sudden

01:23:53.319 --> 01:23:55.238
two others come
from the back of the bank

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:57.657
and we had to get
the fuck out of there.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:23:59.743
We did it right.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.985
We went in right
after they did,

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.372
through the front,
which we thought was best,

01:24:04.706 --> 01:24:06.541
catch 'em off guard
while they're doing their thing.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:09.751
There's an emergency exit
on the side too,

01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:10.612
but I hear it's hard
to break through.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.912
No, see, you were right.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.674
The front entrance
was the best, like you said.

01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:18.303
They never expected us coming
in like that, blasting shit.

01:24:20.764 --> 01:24:21.723
The money, though.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.433
We didn't get anything.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:25.310
It's whatever.

01:24:26.519 --> 01:24:28.936
See, something's up.
Fredrick never told me

01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:30.229
there was gonna
be four of 'em.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:32.275
He just told me some guys
were hitting a bank.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:35.195
It ain't like we haven't been
shot at by four guys before.

01:24:35.987 --> 01:24:37.737
Yeah, I know,
but it's always good

01:24:37.739 --> 01:24:39.589
- to have a heads up.
- Either way,

01:24:40.366 --> 01:24:42.535
we didn't get shot
and they did.

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:46.247
True.

01:24:49.292 --> 01:24:50.835
So what are
they paying you?

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:52.712
What are they paying me?

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.256
Look, man, we have
our own agreement.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:56.714
I owed them some favors

01:24:56.716 --> 01:24:58.551
for some things they
did for me in the past,

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.012
but why?

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:04.390
Well, I can pay you double
what they're paying you.

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:06.518
I'm sure they're
paying you something.

01:25:10.897 --> 01:25:13.691
Look, they're not paying me.

01:25:14.776 --> 01:25:16.486
Like I said,
I owe them a favor.

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:18.738
Is this why you
called me in here?

01:25:19.864 --> 01:25:21.491
No, Ive heard a lot of good things
about you from other people.

01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:24.035
I think we can work
with each other on this one.

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:30.998
How did you find out
about the guys I contracted

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.377
for Ren's bank job?

01:25:33.586 --> 01:25:34.420
I have my ways.

01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:37.132
How did you meet
Ren and his crew?

01:25:38.299 --> 01:25:40.552
I know you mentioned
that you owed 'em a favor,

01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:42.137
but how'd you guys meet?

01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:46.141
Jesus Christ.

01:25:47.058 --> 01:25:47.767
Listen.

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:49.727
I met 'em a few years ago

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.604
through mutual acquaintances.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.107
Done a few jobs
with him and his crew,

01:25:54.858 --> 01:25:56.609
a couple business deals
off and on.

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.487
We basically have
a business relationship.

01:26:01.614 --> 01:26:03.950
So you feel close to him
as a business associate.

01:26:04.742 --> 01:26:07.120
Close? Did I say that?

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.456
Hey, listen, man.

01:26:11.624 --> 01:26:13.585
What exactly do you
want me to do for you?

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:16.085
You mentioned something
vaguely over the phone,

01:26:16.087 --> 01:26:16.796
but, uh...

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:18.921
I'm gonna need more details,

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:20.466
otherwise you're just
wasting my time.

01:26:21.176 --> 01:26:23.553
- What do I want?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

01:26:24.929 --> 01:26:26.721
What I want is for you
to go to Ren's place

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:28.016
and get my money.

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.020
I'd do it myself, man,

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.689
but, uh, you have
a special relationship with him.

01:26:36.691 --> 01:26:39.291
It'd be a lot easier
if you do it.

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.322
Plus, you'd have
a better idea

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.825
where he's stashing it at.

01:26:47.952 --> 01:26:48.802
I see.

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.996
So you want me to do
all the work in this situation

01:26:51.998 --> 01:26:53.448
while you sit
there and watch.

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:57.378
Yeah, watch you make
a couple million bucks.

01:27:01.049 --> 01:27:03.760
You think I can just go in
there and make the demand?

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.346
You think he's just
gonna hand over the money?

01:27:06.846 --> 01:27:09.138
I expect you to do some
of your investigative skills,

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.142
find my money,
and bring it back to me.

01:27:12.435 --> 01:27:14.393
You and I know that Ren's not
gonna give me any answers

01:27:14.395 --> 01:27:16.189
if I call him myself.

01:27:17.565 --> 01:27:19.265
Look, he's not gonna
give me any either.

01:27:20.485 --> 01:27:22.485
You have a better friendship,
business relationship,

01:27:22.487 --> 01:27:24.113
or whatever you
want to call it.

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:25.448
You know him better...

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.983
and he trusts you on a certain
level from what I hear.

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:32.163
Who told you that?

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:34.598
Look, man.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.084
I will pay you double
of what they're paying you.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.046
Or give you 30 percent
of the bank money.

01:27:40.463 --> 01:27:42.590
That's 30 percent of
$10 million, man.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:44.300
Do the math.

01:27:46.469 --> 01:27:48.269
Do we have
a deal or not?

01:27:50.682 --> 01:27:52.223
Hey, listen,
I'll think about it.

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:53.559
Thanks for the drink.

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:00.066
All right.

01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:09.367
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.746
Hey, guys,
my car's battery's out

01:28:15.748 --> 01:28:17.957
about a mile up the road
and my phone's out too,

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:20.336
so will you help me out
with some jumper cables?

01:28:20.545 --> 01:28:21.504
Yeah, maybe.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:25.106
Motherfucker, Lance.

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:28.052
- Yeah?
- Gage Teller from Temple Street, baby.

01:28:28.177 --> 01:28:29.677
Oh, shit!

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:31.180
Oh, buddy!

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:33.973
- What's up, man?
- Gage, man.

01:28:33.975 --> 01:28:36.309
- What's up?
- I hardly recognized you in the dark.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.938
- Same here, man, I almost fucking stabbed you.
- Oh, shit.

01:28:40.565 --> 01:28:41.899
This is my business
colleague, Ren, man.

01:28:41.983 --> 01:28:42.942
- Oh, hey, Lance.
- What's up?

01:28:43.651 --> 01:28:45.194
What's been going on, man?
What's up with you?

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:47.903
Same old just,
you know, working,

01:28:47.905 --> 01:28:49.532
taking care of
my girl and the kids.

01:28:50.199 --> 01:28:51.907
- Kids?
- Yeah, kids.

01:28:51.909 --> 01:28:54.409
- Lance has kids?
- Lance has two kids.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:57.904
We just had our
second one like last week.

01:28:58.249 --> 01:28:59.457
Cool, man,
that's good to hear.

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:03.254
- Same girl?
- Ah, same girl next spring.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:07.089
Okay.
Can I get an invite?

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:08.841
Are you kidding?
Of course, yeah.

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:10.343
All right, I'll be there, man.

01:29:10.762 --> 01:29:12.928
- What... what about you guys?
- Ah, you know,

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:14.513
we're working, man,
working a little hustle,

01:29:14.515 --> 01:29:15.767
- here and there. Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

01:29:15.933 --> 01:29:18.750
Like Temple Street,
that type of hustle?

01:29:18.853 --> 01:29:21.330
Uh, yeah, a little bit,
a little bit.

01:29:21.439 --> 01:29:24.190
Call me a private contractor
for the banking industry.

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:26.192
Nice!

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:27.394
Whatever that means!

01:29:27.737 --> 01:29:30.550
- Come on, man, what are you doing?
- Oh, you know,

01:29:30.656 --> 01:29:32.073
it's the same kind of hustle,
the same kind of shit

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:34.533
- going on on Temple Street, man.
- Okay, yeah, man.

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:38.247
- Just like back in the day.
- Yeah, just a little... Better.

01:29:38.664 --> 01:29:40.583
- All right, man.
- Yeah, what about you?

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:42.917
Okay, I'm cool, all right.

01:29:42.919 --> 01:29:44.545
Y'all got a side hustle
still or not?

01:29:44.962 --> 01:29:48.130
It is a car shop, so there's
opportunities everywhere.

01:29:48.132 --> 01:29:50.883
- Business...
- Yeah. With your, um, brother?

01:29:50.885 --> 01:29:52.593
Yeah, with my brother,

01:29:52.595 --> 01:29:55.429
and he's a good
business partner.

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:57.058
Business is... It's booming.

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:57.991
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:29:58.768 --> 01:30:02.772
Cool, man. Well, shit You know,
actually, my car's all fucked up.

01:30:03.022 --> 01:30:05.606
- What?
- Just a favor right here, can I bring my car to your shop?

01:30:05.608 --> 01:30:06.908
Are you kidding?
Yeah, bring it by.

01:30:07.110 --> 01:30:08.401
Dude, this motherfucker's
always complaining about me.

01:30:08.403 --> 01:30:11.404
My check engine light's been on and
off for fucking 10 years, man.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:13.322
- So I can bring it in?
- Yeah, bring it in.

01:30:13.324 --> 01:30:14.824
I'll take care of it personally.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.869
So you say your
battery's broken, right?

01:30:17.203 --> 01:30:20.233
- Well, yeah, it's dead.
- Dead, broken, whatever, man.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.542
You don't got jumper cables yourself?
You're a mechanic, boy.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:25.595
Come on, man.
All my tools are at the shop.

01:30:25.795 --> 01:30:27.839
All right, it's a dead battery.
It just needs a jump.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:30.464
So are you gonna give me the jumper
cables or you gonna bust my balls?

01:30:30.466 --> 01:30:32.591
- No, I'm just busting your fucking balls, man.
- Okay!

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:35.430
- I think I got that shit inside, actually.
- Oh, my hero.

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:36.513
What street you parked on?

01:30:37.056 --> 01:30:39.390
Whatever street this is. I mean,
make a right out the parking lot,

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:41.242
go up a mile, you'll run
right into my truck.

01:30:41.727 --> 01:30:43.769
I mean, not a gas station
in the area

01:30:43.771 --> 01:30:45.523
or anyone else
with jumper cables.

01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:47.440
My luck, my phone's out.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.026
I couldn't call
Triple-A or anyone.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.736
Been getting aggravated, man.

01:30:51.195 --> 01:30:52.029
Right.

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:54.824
All right, man,
I'm gonna go check inside.

01:30:55.241 --> 01:30:56.325
Nice.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.706
Okay, cool, thanks.

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:17.930
Yeah.

01:31:19.932 --> 01:31:22.393
I see they got
this duffel bag.

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:26.087
It looks pretty heavy.

01:31:26.939 --> 01:31:27.982
Hmm?

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:31.467
Nah, man, they don't
suspect a thing.

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:40.284
So, this is just
for Fredrick, right?

01:31:40.286 --> 01:31:42.538
- This is the 25 percent cut?
- Yeah.

01:31:43.247 --> 01:31:45.166
- 2.5 million, huh?
- Yeah.

01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:48.711
That's a lot of money for a small
contribution in my opinion.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:53.130
Well, that's because Ren has a soft
spot for this guy for some reason.

01:31:53.132 --> 01:31:56.050
He's just a little bit too generous
for this guy for some reason.

01:31:56.052 --> 01:31:59.094
- I know. I know.
- I wouldn't be giving him shit, you know why?

01:31:59.096 --> 01:32:01.057
Because we barely even
know this guy that well.

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:04.393
Well, I guess
I'm a nice guy.

01:32:05.394 --> 01:32:06.602
Well, yeah, that's
what I'm saying. You're a...

01:32:06.604 --> 01:32:08.564
You're a nice guy.

01:32:08.856 --> 01:32:10.106
Yeah, too nice.

01:32:11.275 --> 01:32:13.819
Both of my kids could go to
college with this money, man.

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.489
You know, it's a funny
thing, is, um...

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:19.466
Me and Ren and Orion,

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:22.411
we had like two million dollars
on us from this one job.

01:32:25.414 --> 01:32:28.123
This was like five,
six years ago.

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:29.625
This was when
we first started out,

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:31.420
and we were working
with this other crew.

01:32:32.922 --> 01:32:34.797
And at the end of the day, we
owe everybody this other share.

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:37.508
- And so, like, we walk away with almost nothing.
- Mmm.

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:40.177
Right. Now, that...
That was my bad

01:32:40.179 --> 01:32:41.579
because I did
recommend these guys.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:44.433
But see, I was hoping that
we were gonna get more work.

01:32:44.684 --> 01:32:47.019
See, we didn't really give a
shit about money back then.

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.523
What kind of job?

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:53.732
- Bank job.
- Bank job.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:56.487
Bank job, yeah.
Arizona.

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.655
Yeah, I knew a guy down there
with some really good intel.

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:04.201
So we go down there, we check it out
and walk through it, plan it out.

01:33:04.203 --> 01:33:06.747
We execute it. We do it.
Everything is super good.

01:33:07.665 --> 01:33:09.415
Except for when it
comes time to the split

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:12.545
because then we got eight hands in
on a two million dollar honey pot.

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:16.171
Moral of that story is that you keep
it to a minimum amount of people

01:33:16.173 --> 01:33:18.298
as much as fucking
humanly possible.

01:33:18.801 --> 01:33:20.801
You trust your own
and fuck everybody else.

01:33:20.803 --> 01:33:24.528
But Ren, here...
He's got principles.

01:33:25.474 --> 01:33:27.476
You know, Ren, here,
he's too generous.

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:30.811
He wants to give everybody
a good chunk of the take.

01:33:30.813 --> 01:33:34.400
Hmm. And what was that chunk?
Do I even want to know?

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.109
Don't wanna know.

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:40.823
It was $250,000 each.

01:33:42.033 --> 01:33:43.200
It's embarrassing.

01:33:43.576 --> 01:33:44.869
Yeah.

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:47.913
But then you got to watch out
for the six percent, right?

01:33:48.831 --> 01:33:50.372
- That you give to the government?
- Oh, taxes.

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:52.833
- Yeah, yeah. Taxes, taxes.
- Yeah, no, I'm a good citizen.

01:33:52.835 --> 01:33:54.209
Man, I make sure to do that.

01:33:54.211 --> 01:33:58.299
- I, you know, like, file my 1099s.
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:01.552 --> 01:34:02.676
Orion would've
liked that joke.

01:34:02.678 --> 01:34:05.378
That's a bad joke,
but he would've liked that.

01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:10.227
Um, so when... When are
we dropping this off to the guy?

01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:11.562
Later.

01:34:16.108 --> 01:34:18.110
All right, so then, should I
just go into the other room?

01:34:19.528 --> 01:34:21.362
I mean, are you ready for us
to take care of these guys?

01:34:21.364 --> 01:34:23.064
Are you ready for us
to get the hell out of town?

01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:24.617
We wait.

01:34:27.244 --> 01:34:29.969
Sorry.
I didn't... I didn't hear you.

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:31.623
What part?

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:34.166
Because I want to know
for certain it was them.

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.336
Okay, Ren...

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:39.546
These were the guys,
all right, because Jerry,

01:34:39.548 --> 01:34:42.466
he did all of the fucking
footwork for us,

01:34:42.468 --> 01:34:44.479
and he laid it out
for us. All right?

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:47.096
Now, the guy in there,
he's got a scar on his hand,

01:34:47.098 --> 01:34:48.764
and there's not gonna be
another person in LA

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:50.485
that has a scar
on his hand just like that.

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:54.113
Now, the other... The other guy in
there, okay, is just as guilty.

01:34:54.313 --> 01:34:56.271
So it's time for us to go in
there and take care of them.

01:34:56.273 --> 01:34:58.065
I need you to forget about the
fact that they have a couple of...

01:34:58.067 --> 01:35:00.950
they had a couple
of fucking black ski masks on,

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:03.946
and it's time for us to clean up
and get the fuck out, all right?

01:35:03.948 --> 01:35:06.158
Because I know it was them.
I know it was them!

01:35:08.744 --> 01:35:10.169
You know,
he's right, Ren.

01:35:11.622 --> 01:35:13.124
I know you know
he's right!

01:35:14.417 --> 01:35:16.127
Let's dump
these guys right now.

01:35:20.923 --> 01:35:22.425
Why do you doubt yourself?

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.846
Where's he going?
What about the cops, man?

01:35:27.638 --> 01:35:29.263
Or the rest of their crew?
What if they show up?

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:30.766
We're just sitting
here, waiting.

01:35:33.269 --> 01:35:35.980
Where's he going? You pissed
him off and so he left.

01:35:36.188 --> 01:35:37.982
- I pissed him off?
- You pissed him off.

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:40.025
All right, well, I...

01:35:40.985 --> 01:35:42.776
You, you're funny.
Yeah, all right.

01:35:42.778 --> 01:35:44.113
Well, we pissed him off.

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:48.200
Seriously, though,

01:35:49.201 --> 01:35:51.910
it's time that we go in there
and we grab Cyrus and Diego

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.831
and we fucking put 'em down.

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:55.610
Okay?

01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:58.586
And then we got to get
the hell out of town. Right?

01:35:59.295 --> 01:36:02.256
Oh, I...
Completely agree.

01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.540
But you know
Ren calls the shots.

01:36:09.650 --> 01:36:13.348
See, I do whatever
the hell I want to do

01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:15.811
whenever the hell
I want to do it.

01:36:16.825 --> 01:36:18.489
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:36:19.175 --> 01:36:20.574
You know what I mean?

01:36:44.006 --> 01:36:45.841
Hey, why don't you boys
go ahead and get up?

01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:50.980
Come on up.

01:36:53.432 --> 01:36:55.474
No, whoa! Lean up against
the fucking wall, all right.

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.561
I don't want y'all
comfortable in my space.

01:37:02.691 --> 01:37:03.541
I mean, uh...

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:08.364
Unless you guys are ready
to make a confession. Right?

01:37:08.781 --> 01:37:11.951
Or do you guys want to both continue
to be a bunch of dumb-asses? Right?

01:37:17.456 --> 01:37:21.083
- Hmm, we've been generous.
- Absolutely.

01:37:21.085 --> 01:37:23.337
Ah, yeah, we've been
real generous.

01:37:25.047 --> 01:37:27.339
It could be worse, fellas. You
guys killed my little brother,

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:28.799
so this shit could
get a lot worse.

01:37:28.801 --> 01:37:30.427
It could get
a lot worse.

01:37:30.594 --> 01:37:31.720
Hey, look, bruh...

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:36.183
We were at the bank,
that was us.

01:37:37.226 --> 01:37:39.979
But, uh, I don't know
who shot your brother.

01:37:40.563 --> 01:37:41.981
We were all shooting.

01:37:42.898 --> 01:37:46.944
So, if you're gonna kills us,
then fucking kill us.

01:37:47.862 --> 01:37:50.406
Ah, see, but, look,
I know you won't.

01:37:50.656 --> 01:37:52.992
At least not without your
boyfriend giving you the say-so.

01:37:59.748 --> 01:38:01.709
Look, man,
some shit's just business.

01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:03.417
We just happened
to run into you guys

01:38:03.419 --> 01:38:05.421
at the same time
we were gonna hit the bank.

01:38:05.838 --> 01:38:08.966
- It's just a coincidence.
- Hmm. It's just a coincidence?

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.135
Like me having this
fucking gun to your head,

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:14.587
that's just a fucking
coincidence, right?

01:38:15.598 --> 01:38:17.639
And this little finger right here,
I put that shit on the trigger

01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:19.308
and I pull back and a bullet
goes through your fucking head,

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.478
and that's just
a fucking coincidence, right?

01:38:21.979 --> 01:38:24.023
'Cause it's just fucking
business, right?

01:38:25.357 --> 01:38:27.276
Hey, bro, he's right, man.

01:38:28.694 --> 01:38:30.446
We've had that place
scoped out for a while now.

01:38:30.654 --> 01:38:32.740
When we went in there
and seen you guys with guns,

01:38:33.198 --> 01:38:34.575
we thought you were
gonna shot at us.

01:38:35.951 --> 01:38:38.537
You guys seemed on edge. We
didn't mean to kill your brother.

01:38:39.038 --> 01:38:40.497
It was self defense.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:44.793
- Self defense.
- Hmm.

01:38:45.336 --> 01:38:46.378
Why are you lying?

01:38:47.129 --> 01:38:49.131
Why y'all fucking around?
I don't like fucking around.

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:52.927
Well, who sent you?

01:38:53.886 --> 01:38:56.472
That's all we want to know,
is who sent you.

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.514
Look, I already told
you everything.

01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:00.716
Nobody sent us.

01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:03.769
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, but see, I look at the two of you guys

01:39:03.771 --> 01:39:04.853
and I just know
you're not smart enough

01:39:04.855 --> 01:39:06.815
to be able to pull off
a fucking bank job on your own.

01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:09.816
You know what I mean? Like you
bitches tying your own shoes

01:39:09.818 --> 01:39:11.570
is gonna require
a group effort, right?

01:39:12.905 --> 01:39:14.696
I know where you're from:
Eastside, Westside,

01:39:14.698 --> 01:39:17.117
Northside, Southside,
Bayside, fucking Disneyland.

01:39:17.242 --> 01:39:19.995
I don't give a shit where the
fuck you're from. You get me?

01:39:20.955 --> 01:39:23.664
Yeah, that's nice. We don't give
a fuck where you're from either.

01:39:23.666 --> 01:39:25.999
Ah, good, all right.
Well, we got that shit settled.

01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:28.201
Why don't both you fucking
bitches get down on the ground?

01:39:30.547 --> 01:39:33.092
- Gage, give 'em a little incentive.
- Mmm.

01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:43.016
- There you go. There you go.
- Both of you. There you go.

01:39:43.018 --> 01:39:44.685
Good dogs. Good dogs.
Good dogs.

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:46.855
All the fucking way down,
all the way down.

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:49.358
Hmm.

01:39:51.568 --> 01:39:52.734
Now you tell me
right the fuck now

01:39:52.736 --> 01:39:55.320
why I don't just fucking put a
bullet through your goddamn head

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:58.158
and then put one through your fucking
boyfriend's head right afterwards?

01:39:58.701 --> 01:40:01.284
Shoot me, pussy! Yeah,
you ain't gonna do shit.

01:40:01.286 --> 01:40:02.369
- Right.
- Yeah, you ain't...

01:40:02.371 --> 01:40:04.371
Ow! Motherfucker! Ow!

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:05.791
- Mm-hmm.
- Shoot me, motherfucker!

01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:07.167
Shoot...

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:11.088
- Hold this for me for a second, please.
- No problem.

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.938
You, look at me.
Look at me.

01:40:14.299 --> 01:40:16.744
All right, now are you gonna
tell me what I want to know

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.430
or are you gonna be a smart-ass like
your little fucking friend here, huh?

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:26.687
Huh? Oh, you're gonna
go fucking quiet, huh?

01:40:28.313 --> 01:40:30.941
That's fucking good because I'm
gonna be right the fuck back.

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:46.707
Yeah.

01:41:10.147 --> 01:41:11.523
All right, Ren.

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:13.942
Ren, what's the deal, huh?

01:41:14.401 --> 01:41:16.278
We gonna kill these guys
and get out of town?

01:41:19.156 --> 01:41:21.625
We're just wasting time by
chilling and waiting, man, right?

01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:24.953
These guys just made a joke out of the
fact that they killed Orion. Okay?

01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:27.204
So let's get the fucking
killing revolvers,

01:41:27.206 --> 01:41:29.208
let's kill these guys, and let's
get the fuck out of town.

01:41:38.050 --> 01:41:40.636
Hell, yeah. Okay!

01:41:41.804 --> 01:41:43.138
Fucking-A!

01:41:47.684 --> 01:41:51.563
Come on, bro. Get up.

01:41:56.985 --> 01:41:59.738
Oh, look who it is,
the three bitches.

01:42:00.405 --> 01:42:01.446
Y'all gonna shoot us
or what?

01:42:01.448 --> 01:42:03.740
- I mean, if y'all gonna do it, then do it.
- Shut the fuck up, okay.

01:42:03.742 --> 01:42:05.536
Nobody told you
to say a goddamn thing.

01:42:05.702 --> 01:42:06.995
Fuck you, pussy! Shoot!

01:42:09.706 --> 01:42:13.085
- Whoever said we were gonna shoot you?
- Yes, do it.

01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:16.630
You can't do it.
Show me!

01:42:18.132 --> 01:42:21.969
And you ain't gonna
do shit eith...

01:42:25.514 --> 01:42:27.222
How do you like that, huh? Now are you
gonna be like this worthless piece of shit

01:42:27.224 --> 01:42:28.306
or are you gonna tell us
what we need to know?

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.978
Now who set us up
at the Westland Bank downtown?

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:35.899
Fuck you.

01:42:37.675 --> 01:42:39.444
What the fuck was that?

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:41.695
I don't know.
Did you invite somebody?

01:42:41.697 --> 01:42:42.823
Is it the fucking girls?

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:53.167
What the fuck you doing?

01:42:55.043 --> 01:42:56.336
Where's the money, Ren?

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.006
What money?

01:42:59.423 --> 01:43:01.550
You know what I'm talking about.
Don't play dumb with me.

01:43:01.967 --> 01:43:05.012
Jerry, are you losing your mind, man?
We're all friends here.

01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:07.973
Shut up, Jessie.
I'm talking to Ren.

01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.516
This is between me and him.

01:43:09.975 --> 01:43:12.811
- Who you working for?
- Who am I working for?

01:43:13.228 --> 01:43:14.771
I work for myself,
motherfucker!

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.608
Where's the money
from the goddamn bank?

01:43:17.691 --> 01:43:19.107
It's not yours.
You're not gonna get any of it.

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:21.069
You're not even gonna see
a fucking dollar of it, Jerry.

01:43:21.987 --> 01:43:23.087
Didn't I tell you
to shut the fuck up?

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:26.281
Look, Jerry, I don't know what's going on
with you, but I got a couple of good ideas.

01:43:26.283 --> 01:43:28.283
Right now, you've got a gun on him
and I've got a fucking gun on you,

01:43:28.285 --> 01:43:31.580
so unless you want to get hurt, you
better put your fucking gun down!

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.001
You know what?

01:43:39.296 --> 01:43:40.380
I don't really give a fuck.

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:22.547
It was Fredrick... He sent me.

01:44:24.299 --> 01:44:25.926
He wanted his money.

01:44:28.762 --> 01:44:30.222
I couldn't say no, man.

01:44:31.181 --> 01:44:32.683
He offered me three mil.

01:44:36.937 --> 01:44:37.787
Sorry.

01:44:38.855 --> 01:44:40.565
It's just business, man.

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.360
Just business.

01:46:29.300 --> 01:46:30.882
Looking for someone?

01:46:30.884 --> 01:46:31.968
Yeah.

01:46:33.387 --> 01:46:34.554
What up, kid?

01:46:36.181 --> 01:46:38.809
I knew you were smart enough to come
deliver my fair share of the money.

01:46:39.684 --> 01:46:41.228
After all, you owe me.

01:46:45.232 --> 01:46:46.441
Where's your strap?

01:46:49.027 --> 01:46:50.552
You're just trying
to shoot me or what?

01:46:54.324 --> 01:46:56.032
And here I thought Jerry
and those two fucking idiots

01:46:56.034 --> 01:46:58.120
would've taken care of what I wanted.
I guess not.

01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:04.167
Knowing you, my guess is that
they're all dead, aren't they?

01:47:06.169 --> 01:47:08.088
Some people
never change, man.

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:12.926
Well, you better lighten up because
you're in my house now, motherfucker!

01:47:13.343 --> 01:47:14.759
You've taken
this shit too far.

01:47:14.761 --> 01:47:17.556
Nah, man, you've
taken this shit too far.

01:47:18.056 --> 01:47:19.349
Who did you come with?

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:22.769
Oh, you don't want
to answer my questions, huh?

01:47:25.856 --> 01:47:27.441
I want what's
in the bag, man.

01:47:27.732 --> 01:47:28.859
Open it!

01:47:38.743 --> 01:47:40.954
Put the stacks of cash
on the couch, man.

01:47:45.167 --> 01:47:46.418
One by one,
motherfucker.

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:54.384
Fuck yeah.
