36:39.238 --> 36:40.865
<i>- We got more quantity going.
- Stuck in the machine... </i>

36:40.907 --> 36:42.783
<i>Maybe less quality,
but fuck it.</i>

36:42.825 --> 36:45.244

You see clients?</i>

36:47.872 --> 36:50.166
No. Just manage.

a cock even bigger than mine.</i>

36:56.839 --> 36:58.466
<i>So what you gonna do, Julian?</i>

36:58.507 --> 37:00.259
<i>I have no idea.</i>

37:01.344 --> 37:02.595
<i>You're not thinking
about going back to us.</i>

37:02.637 --> 37:04.263
Definitely not.

38:58.210 --> 39:02.965
<i>Oh, no, no. [chuckles]</i>

<i>Do I-I go to some other place?</i>

39:53.474 --> 39:55.559
<i>No. I mean...</i>

39:59.730 --> 40:02.942
<i>...where am I gonna go, right?</i>

40:04.485 --> 40:08.197
<i>Since I was a kid, I could
always just be this other guy.</i>

40:09.448 --> 40:12.410
<i>You know, this guy
who isn't scared.</i>

40:12.451 --> 40:16.414
<i>He can... He can take anything.</i>

40:16.455 --> 40:18.416
<i>You can't hurt him.</i>

40:19.708 --> 40:22.503
<i>I don't know, I just...</i>

40:22.545 --> 40:25.297
<i>I put on the clothes,
I put on the shoes...</i>

40:28.801 --> 40:31.720
<i>...and I can just be him.</i>

40:31.762 --> 40:33.931
<i>And he does what
he's gotta do.</i>

40:33.973 --> 40:38.436
<i>I jump in the water
and I wash him off,</i>

40:38.477 --> 40:41.397
<i>and then I get to be me.</i>

40:41.439 --> 40:44.191
<i>This is me.</i>

40:45.484 --> 40:48.154
<i>I don't want you to doubt that.</i>

40:59.623 --> 41:01.959
<i>How about from now on
we don't do anything</i>

41:02.001 --> 41:05.629
<i>that we have to wash away?</i>

41:09.675 --> 41:12.595

41:19.310 --> 41:21.145
<i>Hmm?</i>

41:22.104 --> 41:23.481

42:03.771 --> 42:06.232
<i>Thought I killed that girl.</i>

42:08.609 --> 42:11.570
<i>Why'd you say that?</i>

42:11.612 --> 42:13.948
<i>I've done things.</i>

42:13.989 --> 42:16.367
<i>Like what?</i>

42:17.284 --> 42:19.662
<i>I've hurt people.</i>

42:22.706 --> 42:27.127
<i>J... you ain't hurt nobody.</i>

<i>I wanted to, uh, be liked
by the other kids, you know?</i>

42:39.682 --> 42:43.310

<i>and I looked around...</i>

43:06.834 --> 43:08.794
<i>...and there was a rock
in my hand,</i>

43:08.836 --> 43:12.464
<i>and, uh, it had pieces
of Derek's head on it.</i>

43:15.718 --> 43:19.722
<i>Well... I saw that boy
laying there.</i>

43:19.763 --> 43:21.849
<i>He's bleeding out,
you know, trying to breathe.</i>

43:21.890 --> 43:23.976

<i>Why don't you have a seat?</i>

50:22.310 --> 50:23.979
<i>- Okay?
- Yeah.</i>

what he was saying.</i>

50:44.708 --> 50:47.544
<i>He was on his deathbed.
He was nearly gone, you know?</i>

50:47.586 --> 50:49.880
<i>I get in there and I said,
"Who hired you?</i>

50:49.921 --> 50:52.674
<i>Who hired you? Who hired you?
I'm talking about this case."</i>

50:52.716 --> 50:55.260
<i>And I don't know what he heard.
I don't know it.</i>

mumbling stuff.</i>

50:57.304 --> 51:00.724
<i>Didn't make a lot of sense.
Didn't sound like words, either.</i>

51:00.766 --> 51:02.768
<i>But I thought maybe it would
make some sense to you.</i>

51:02.809 --> 51:05.562
<i>- What'd he say?
- He said "Keen."</i>

51:05.604 --> 51:08.523
