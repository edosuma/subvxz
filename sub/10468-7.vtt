WEBVTT

00:01.803 --> 00:03.095
MARY ANNE, I'M, UM,

00:04.443 --> 00:06.148
I'M RUNNING OUT
OF PATIENCE HERE.

00:06.716 --> 00:09.235
YOU SAID TO SIT TIGHT
UNTIL YOU CHECK OUT THEIR STORY,

00:09.685 --> 00:12.549
LOOK, BE GRATEFUL MYRA'S MOTHER
IS LETTING US LOOK INTO THIS

00:12.569 --> 00:13.858
BEFORE SHE
FILES CHARGES.

00:14.928 --> 00:16.032
GRATEFUL?

00:19.036 --> 00:20.278
THE WHOLE THING
IS MADE UP.

00:20.598 --> 00:21.900
THE WHOLE THING
IS A LIE.

00:21.900 --> 00:24.948
WELL, CHARLIE, THAT'S WHY YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO OFFER.

00:25.469 --> 00:26.740
SHE'S OFFERING
SOMETHING.

00:27.690 --> 00:29.342
MYRA'S MOTHER SAYS
SHE WON'T FILE CHARGES,

00:29.342 --> 00:31.344
SHE'LL LET
THE WHOLE THING GO AWAY,

00:32.374 --> 00:33.955
IF YOU'LL RESIGN
FROM YOUR JOB.

00:37.858 --> 00:39.132
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE KIDDING ME.

00:39.602 --> 00:40.875
RESIGN.

00:42.492 --> 00:44.966
MARY ANNE, I
DIDN'T DO THIS.

00:44.966 --> 00:46.186
I DON'T DOUBT THAT.

00:47.186 --> 00:48.782
BUT I GOTTA
FACE REALITY HERE.

00:49.232 --> 00:51.142
AN OFFER LIKE THIS
SPARES EVERYONE,

00:51.312 --> 00:52.757
YOU AND THE SCHOOL.

00:52.757 --> 00:54.367
TREMENDOUS EXPENSE
AND HEARTACHE.

00:54.687 --> 00:55.986
YOU'RE SAYING
I SHOULD DO THIS.

00:56.236 --> 00:58.197
THE SCHOOL CAN OFFER
A SEVERANCE PACKAGE,

00:58.197 --> 00:59.633
SOMETHING
AFFORDING YOU TIME

00:59.633 --> 01:00.634
TO LOOK FOR OTHER WORK--

01:00.634 --> 01:01.649
MARY ANNE, STOP.

01:01.689 --> 01:05.059
THERE IS NO WAY.
NO WAY.

01:06.029 --> 01:07.380
IT'S LIKE SAYING
THAT I'M GUILTY.

01:07.380 --> 01:08.422
LISTEN TO ME.

01:08.442 --> 01:10.857
NO ONE ELSE KNOWS
THESE CHARGES EXIST,

01:11.297 --> 01:13.583
SO TO EVERYONE ELSE,
IT'S LIKE SAYING THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

01:13.778 --> 01:15.833
WHICH IT DIDN'T.
I MEAN...

01:16.983 --> 01:18.391
DOESN'T THAT
MATTER AT ALL?

01:18.391 --> 01:19.610
THIS NEVER
HAPPENED.

01:19.610 --> 01:20.762
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

01:20.772 --> 01:22.008
IF THIS GETS OUT,

01:22.028 --> 01:25.703
IF THESE CHARGES
GO ON RECORD, IT HAPPENED.

01:26.393 --> 01:27.444
WHAT?

01:27.444 --> 01:29.092
CHARLIE, IN THE EYES
OF THE PARENTS,

01:29.142 --> 01:30.619
LOTS OF THEM,
YOU'LL BE GUILTY.

01:30.809 --> 01:32.231
NO MATTER
WHAT VERDICT THERE IS,

01:32.231 --> 01:33.763
THAT'S THE WAY

02:23.382 --> 02:24.711
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:25.371 --> 02:27.840
WELL, TECHNICALLY
I LIVE HERE.

02:28.790 --> 02:29.848
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

02:29.888 --> 02:31.422
OH, UH, GOD, OF COURSE.

02:31.452 --> 02:34.463
YOU--UH, EVAN'S SON.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.247
BRIAN, RIGHT?

02:37.367 --> 02:38.998
YOU GO TO
U.C. SANTA CRUZ?

02:39.298 --> 02:42.345
AND YOU'RE...
WEARING HIS SHIRT.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.584
I'M JULIA, UH, SALINGER.

02:46.604 --> 02:47.608
DID HE NOT TELL YOU I WAS--

02:47.638 --> 02:49.719
'CAUSE HE DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT YOU WERE, UM--

02:49.759 --> 02:51.010
HE DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS COMING.

02:52.790 --> 02:54.871
WHICH IS PROBABLY
WHY HE NEVER MENTIONED YOU.

02:58.614 --> 03:01.059
UNTITLED MEMOIR
BY JULIA SALINGER.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.601
SO, HOW DID YOU FILL
UP ALL THESE PAGES?

03:05.601 --> 03:06.863
YOU'RE LIKE,
MY AGE, RIGHT?

03:07.153 --> 03:10.155
IT'S, UM,
IT'S A LONG STORY.

03:10.675 --> 03:11.852
HEY, GOOD MORNING.

03:11.852 --> 03:12.853
HI, UM...

03:13.203 --> 03:14.225
HEY, DAD.

03:15.682 --> 03:19.469
BRIAN. HEY. SO,

03:20.119 --> 03:22.079
YOU GOT OUT
FOR THANKSGIVING AFTER ALL, HUH?

03:22.779 --> 03:25.301
SORT OF.
I DROPPED OUT.

03:27.503 --> 03:29.801
REALLY?
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

03:32.558 --> 03:34.566
YESTERDAY,
ACTUALLY.

03:35.136 --> 03:36.486
MM-HMM.
ANY IDEA WHEN

03:36.486 --> 03:39.558
THE DEADLINE FOR
THE TUITION REFUND PASSES?

03:40.188 --> 03:43.192
I THINK IT WAS
LAST WEEK. WHY?

03:44.472 --> 03:46.618
BECAUSE IT'S ALL
ABOUT THE MONEY, DAD?

03:47.148 --> 03:48.771
WELL, THAT SEEMS TO BE
WHAT YOU'RE MAKING IT.

03:49.281 --> 03:52.763
3 SCHOOLS, 3 YEARS' TUITION,
HOW MANY CREDITS? ZERO.

03:52.943 --> 03:55.138
GOD, THAT'S REALLY
ALL YOU CARE ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

03:55.156 --> 03:57.942
BRIAN,
I AM NOT THE ONE

03:57.942 --> 03:59.886
DESTROYING MY COLLEGE
CAREER OUT OF SPITE.

04:00.336 --> 04:01.343
YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.509
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M HERE.

04:05.689 --> 04:07.038
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
TOO BUSY

04:07.038 --> 04:08.344
SLEEPING WITH
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS

04:08.344 --> 04:09.436
TO CARE ABOUT
YOUR OWN.

04:16.892 --> 04:19.077
HEY, YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS THANKSGIVING MENU

04:19.110 --> 04:20.357
BEFORE IT GOES
TO THE PRINTER?

04:20.617 --> 04:21.718
THANKSGIVING MENU?

04:22.358 --> 04:23.794
SINCE WHEN ARE WE OPEN
FOR THANKSGIVING?

04:23.794 --> 04:25.535
WELL, SINCE
I'VE GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO,

04:25.535 --> 04:26.884
IT'S--IT'S--
OUR NUMBERS ARE

04:26.884 --> 04:28.276
TRENDING DOWN
A LITTLE LATELY.

04:28.276 --> 04:29.887
JOE, OUR NUMBERS
ARE FINE,

04:29.887 --> 04:31.523
AND BESIDES,
YOU HAVE PLANS

04:31.533 --> 04:33.318
FOR THANKSGIVING ALREADY.
YOU'RE COMING TO OUR HOUSE.

04:33.319 --> 04:34.718
OH, YEAH?
YOU GONNA DO

04:34.718 --> 04:36.763
THE BIG SALINGER
THANKSGIVING FEAST?

04:36.763 --> 04:37.808
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
HOW BIG--

04:37.808 --> 04:38.896
OH, I'M SORRY, MISS.

04:38.896 --> 04:40.376
WE'RE NOT
QUITE OPEN YET.

04:40.376 --> 04:42.017
THAT'S OK, I'M HERE
TO TALK TO THE OWNER.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.338
OH, OK. EXCUSE ME.

04:49.025 --> 04:50.467
YOU HAVEN'T
RETURNED MY CALLS.

04:51.537 --> 04:53.412
TRACY, COME ON.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

04:54.342 --> 04:55.478
YOU'RE MARRIED.

04:55.478 --> 04:56.957
YEAH, I KNOW,
'CAUSE YOU

04:56.957 --> 04:58.394
TELL ME THAT
EVERY 5 SECONDS.

04:58.394 --> 04:59.699
WELL, WHAT AM
I SUPPOSED TO--

04:59.699 --> 05:02.441
BAILEY, YOU CARE MORE
ABOUT MY MARRIAGE

05:02.441 --> 05:04.849
THAN, WELL,
THE 2 PEOPLE IN IT.

05:05.509 --> 05:07.387
YOU AND I,
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME TOGETHER.

05:08.467 --> 05:09.753
I JUST KEEP
THINKING THAT

05:10.013 --> 05:11.528
IF MY MARRIAGE
DOESN'T BOTHER ME,

05:12.018 --> 05:13.098
WHY DOES IT
BOTHER YOU?

05:13.108 --> 05:14.975
BECAUSE
THERE'S A GUY OUT THERE

05:14.975 --> 05:15.976
WHO WOULD BE BOTHERED,

05:16.586 --> 05:17.799
WHO THINKS
YOU'RE BEING FAITHFUL.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.608
FRANKLIN COULDN'T
CARE LESS. HE'S--

05:22.308 --> 05:24.289
HIS SECRETARY
CALLED ME YESTERDAY TO TELL ME

05:24.289 --> 05:27.074
THAT HE'S SPENDING
THANKSGIVING IN LONDON, WORKING.

05:29.144 --> 05:30.148
I'M SORRY.

05:30.158 --> 05:31.836
NO. IT'S JUST
THE WAY IT WORKS.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.604
HE GETS
TO GO TO ENGLAND WITH HIS SECRETARY,

05:34.604 --> 05:38.324
AND I GET TO HAVE
THANKSGIVING ALL TO MYSELF,

05:39.304 --> 05:42.350
WHICH WOULDN'T
BOTHER ME...

05:44.061 --> 05:45.262
IF I HAD IT
WITH YOU.

05:50.901 --> 05:53.511
LOOK, TRACY,
I WISH I COULD, OK, I DO,

05:56.311 --> 05:57.326
BUT I'M SORRY.

06:00.671 --> 06:03.182
YEAH. ME, TOO.

06:10.477 --> 06:11.692
HEY, CLAUDIA.

06:13.641 --> 06:14.706
I HEARD YOU WERE SICK.

06:16.586 --> 06:17.603
WHAT?

06:17.603 --> 06:18.733
ARE YOU OK?

06:19.953 --> 06:21.804
'CAUSE I WAS GONNA CALL YOU,
BUT I THOUGHT THAT, UM,

06:22.711 --> 06:24.793
I DON'T KNOW, I THOUGHT
THAT YOU'D PROBABLY STILL BE, UH,

06:25.871 --> 06:27.360
MAD ABOUT THE PARTY.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.644
MAD? DEREK--

06:30.664 --> 06:32.054
YEAH, I,
I GUESS I, UM...

06:33.664 --> 06:36.931
I GUESS I HAD A FEW TOO MANY,
I GOT A LITTLE OUT OF CONTROL, HUH?

06:37.449 --> 06:39.961
A LITTLE? YOU--

06:39.991 --> 06:41.389
WELL, COME ON,
WE WERE JUST HAVING FUN.

06:43.739 --> 06:44.848
WELL, ANYWAY, I, UM,

06:45.588 --> 06:47.099
I SAID I WAS SORRY, OK?

06:51.364 --> 06:53.004
WHAT? WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

06:55.449 --> 06:56.602
LOOK, I GOTTA...

07:03.820 --> 07:07.174
HEY, THIS JOB
LOOKS PROMISING.

07:07.784 --> 07:08.827
MM-HMM.

07:11.501 --> 07:14.845
HMM. OF COURSE, THAT LOOKS
EVEN MORE PROMISING.

07:16.915 --> 07:17.936
WHAT?

07:18.106 --> 07:19.149
WHAT?

07:19.839 --> 07:21.580
OH, ARE YOU KIDDING?
NO WAY.

07:21.580 --> 07:22.707
THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN.

07:23.137 --> 07:27.170
HE'S JULIA'S EX-HUSBAND,
AND I'M CHARLIE'S EX-WHATEVER I AM.

07:27.412 --> 07:29.165
I WOULD JUST--
IT WOULD BE TOO WEIRD.

07:29.545 --> 07:31.372
IT WOULD BE
TOO PERFECT.

07:31.372 --> 07:32.722
I KNOW, BUT, OK.

07:32.722 --> 07:35.703
THERE'S THIS ONE MINOR DETAIL.
HE'S COMPLETELY NOT INTERESTED.

07:35.986 --> 07:37.145
SO MAKE HIM
INTERESTED.

07:37.285 --> 07:39.037
WELL, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

07:39.467 --> 07:43.009
AM I SUPPOSED TO WALK UP TO HIM
AND, LIKE, "OH, GRIFFIN, OH."

07:43.345 --> 07:44.400
Griffin: YEAH?

07:46.823 --> 07:48.085
HOW'S IT GOING?

07:48.085 --> 07:49.347
GOOD.

07:58.910 --> 07:59.934
WHAT?

08:00.654 --> 08:01.691
NOTHING.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.315
ACTUALLY, I WAS
JUST, UM, LEAVING.

08:05.555 --> 08:07.979
WEEK 2 OF MY PATHETIC
JOB SEARCH CONTINUES,

08:07.989 --> 08:11.874
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE
A JOB INTERVIEW AT YOGA RAMA, SO--

08:11.934 --> 08:13.603
WAIT, UH, DAPHNE,

08:14.113 --> 08:15.279
HMM?
HOW WILL YOU GET THERE?

08:15.759 --> 08:18.855
YOU KNOW, WITH YOUR CAR
IN THE SHOP AND EVERYTHING?

08:20.005 --> 08:21.118
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOUR CAR?

08:21.118 --> 08:22.263
-IT WON'T START.
-NOTHING.

08:22.423 --> 08:25.837
UH, NOTHING A LITTLE
MAINTENANCE WON'T FIX.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.429
WELL, DO YOU NEED
A RIDE SOMEWHERE?

08:28.429 --> 08:33.166
UH, YES. THANK YOU.

08:33.826 --> 08:36.263
OK, UM, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

08:36.263 --> 08:38.582
I'LL GO GET ANOTHER HELMET,
AND I'LL MEET YOU OUT FRONT, ALL RIGHT?

08:39.222 --> 08:40.224
OK.

08:40.224 --> 08:41.442
ALL RIGHT.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.230
YOU ARE
PURE EVIL.

08:46.230 --> 08:48.058
AND YOU ARE WELCOME.

08:49.097 --> 08:50.118
GO.

08:50.138 --> 08:51.327
[LAUGHS]

08:53.237 --> 08:55.152
IT WAS CALLED, UH,
GOLDEN DRAGON

08:55.152 --> 08:57.197
OR GOLDEN PALACE,
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

08:57.927 --> 08:59.836
SO, I KNOW THIS IS COMPLETELY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

08:59.866 --> 09:03.121
BUT YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED THIS MORNING WITH BRIAN?

09:03.421 --> 09:05.205
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THAT. HE'LL BE BACK.

09:05.205 --> 09:06.861
HE'S, UH,
JUST BLOWING OFF SOME STEAM.

09:07.411 --> 09:08.799
BY DROPPING
OUT OF SCHOOL?

09:09.079 --> 09:11.782
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
JUST A LITTLE GAME THAT WE PLAY.

09:12.542 --> 09:15.444
YOU KNOW, HE, UH, CLAIMS TO HATE
EVERY SCHOOL THAT I SEND HIM TO.

09:15.541 --> 09:17.155
DARTMOUTH, GRINNELL,

09:17.325 --> 09:18.946
I GUESS HE HATED
SANTA CRUZ, TOO.

09:19.466 --> 09:20.513
YOU GUESS?

09:20.873 --> 09:22.329
YEAH, WELL, BRIAN AND I
REALLY DON'T TALK.

09:23.209 --> 09:25.589
HE YELLS, ACTS OUT,
TRYING TO GET

09:25.619 --> 09:26.620
SOME SORT
OF REACTION.

09:27.010 --> 09:30.648
HMM. WELL,
WOULDN'T IT BE CHEAPER JUST TO REACT?

09:34.060 --> 09:36.060
WELL, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT I DO THAT?

09:37.150 --> 09:38.630
I'VE YELLED, I'VE CRIED.

09:38.850 --> 09:41.656
I'VE DONE FAMILY THERAPY
WITH HIM,

09:42.416 --> 09:45.783
YEAH, MAYBE IT'S MY FAULT.
MAYBE WE HAD HIM TOO YOUNG.

09:46.279 --> 09:48.994
I WAS, UH, 18
WHEN HE WAS BORN.

09:49.844 --> 09:52.383
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING
THAT I SAY RIGHT NOW

09:52.383 --> 09:55.112
IS--IS WRONG SOMEHOW,
YOU KNOW,

09:55.342 --> 09:58.511
SO, UH, SO I JUST,
I END UP DOING NOTHING.

10:03.568 --> 10:05.222
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'VE GOT CHARLIE,

10:05.222 --> 10:08.442
KIRSTEN, JULIA,
CLAUD, OWEN, DIANA, YOU, ME--

10:08.442 --> 10:10.837
WHOA. REMEMBER WHEN
IT WAS SALINGER, PARTY OF 5?

10:10.927 --> 10:12.575
WILL, YOU COMING
FOR THANKSGIVING?

10:12.825 --> 10:14.274
YOU MEAN, SINCE
MY PARENTS STOPPED SPEAKING TO ME?

10:14.384 --> 10:15.406
WHERE ELSE
AM I GONNA GO?

10:15.406 --> 10:16.886
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'VE GOT WILL,

10:17.236 --> 10:19.397
GRIFFIN, DAPHNE,
AND IF PEOPLE BRING DATES,

10:19.627 --> 10:21.085
MAN, HOW MANY
TURKEYS IS THAT?

10:21.285 --> 10:22.934
ALL RIGHT,
SO I'M TAKING OFF.

10:23.194 --> 10:24.851
I TOLD OWEN
TO FINISH HIS MATH

10:24.881 --> 10:27.070
BEFORE CARTOONS,
SO I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

10:27.070 --> 10:28.377
SEE YA.
HEY, VIC,

10:28.767 --> 10:30.064
YOU GOT PLANS
FOR THANKSGIVING?

10:30.464 --> 10:33.254
OH, WELL, MY FAMILY'S
KIND OF, UM,

10:33.414 --> 10:35.295
ALL OVER THE MAP
RIGHT NOW, SO--

10:35.295 --> 10:36.819
SO GREAT, YOU'LL
HAVE DINNER WITH US.

10:37.249 --> 10:38.659
OH, WOW, UM,

10:39.299 --> 10:42.115
THANKS, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU GUYS HAVE A PRETTY FULL HOUSE, SO--

10:42.128 --> 10:44.217
COME ON, YOU CAN'T
BE ALONE FOR THANKSGIVING.

10:44.217 --> 10:45.697
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY.
WE'LL DO POT LUCK.

10:45.697 --> 10:47.525
POT LUCK? WE'RE NOT
DOING POT LUCK.

10:47.525 --> 10:48.808
THERE'S NO SHAME
IN POT LUCK.

10:48.818 --> 10:49.854
REALLY, GUYS--

10:49.874 --> 10:51.952
JOE, WE'RE NOT SCRAPING
BOTTOM HERE, OK?

10:51.972 --> 10:54.060
BUSINESS IS A LITTLE OFF,
BUT WE DON'T NEED DONATIONS.

10:54.185 --> 10:55.634
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.674
VICTOR, YOU'RE
JOINING US, OK?

10:57.694 --> 10:59.564
IT'S NO BIG DEAL,
BECAUSE IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

11:01.452 --> 11:02.472
OK?

11:04.222 --> 11:05.347
OK.

11:08.241 --> 11:09.329
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

11:09.329 --> 11:10.550
LOOK, I KNOW. I KNOW.

11:10.690 --> 11:12.332
I FELT THE SAME WAY.

11:12.332 --> 11:13.899
YOU'D BE SAYING
THAT YOU'RE GUILTY.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.553
YOU'D BE SAYING
THAT SHE'S RIGHT.

11:15.553 --> 11:17.607
KIRSTEN, CALM DOWN
FOR A SECOND AND LISTEN TO THIS, OK?

11:17.997 --> 11:19.600
IT ACTUALLY GIVES US
SOME OPTIONS.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.132
YOU CAN'T LET HER
DO THIS, CHARLIE.

11:21.152 --> 11:22.429
KIRSTEN, LISTEN.

11:25.345 --> 11:26.403
THIS SEVERANCE
MONEY,

11:27.333 --> 11:29.410
IT MEANS THAT I CAN ADD ON HOURS
AT THE FACTORY

11:29.610 --> 11:31.264
AND STILL GET PAID
BY THE SCHOOL.

11:31.264 --> 11:33.127
I'D BE MAKING TWICE
WHAT I'M MAKING RIGHT NOW,

11:33.157 --> 11:34.290
AND WE NEED THAT MONEY.
YOU KNOW THAT.

11:34.310 --> 11:35.812
I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.

11:37.482 --> 11:39.521
I HOPE THE SCHOOL
DIDN'T TELL YOU TO TAKE THIS.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.581
PLEASE LISTEN.

11:42.231 --> 11:44.658
LOOK, WE JUST DID
THE IVF,

11:45.148 --> 11:46.410
AND THE DOCTOR
SAID THAT

11:46.410 --> 11:48.468
ANY KIND OF STRESS
IS A BAD IDEA, SO--

11:48.478 --> 11:50.148
WHO THE HELL
IS THIS WOMAN?

11:50.808 --> 11:52.764
SHE SHOULD GET
ON HER KNEES AND THANK YOU.

11:52.764 --> 11:54.131
-YOU WERE TRYING TO HELP HER DAUGHTER,
-STOP.

11:54.141 --> 11:55.461
-AND THEN SHE GOES AND DOES THIS?
-PLEASE, DO YOU HEAR ME?

11:55.501 --> 11:56.649
PLEASE STOP.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.525
THIS IS THE REASON
TO TAKE THE DEAL. RIGHT HERE.

12:01.835 --> 12:02.994
LOOK HOW UPSET
YOU ARE.

12:06.457 --> 12:12.166
LOOK...THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE
THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT, KIRSTEN.

12:13.790 --> 12:17.789
AND FOR US TO START
SOME KIND OF WAR

12:17.789 --> 12:19.527
ABOUT ALL THIS,
IT--

12:21.227 --> 12:23.055
WE HAVE WAY TOO MUCH
TO LOSE.

12:34.641 --> 12:36.134
HEY,
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.847
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

12:42.454 --> 12:46.252
JULE, IF I TELL
YOU SOMETHING,

12:46.252 --> 12:47.318
WILL YOU, UH,

12:48.298 --> 12:49.800
WILL YOU PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYONE?

12:51.790 --> 12:53.505
SURE, CLAUD, OF COURSE.
WHAT'S UP?

12:54.535 --> 12:55.598
IT'S JUST...

12:59.744 --> 13:00.747
I WENT...

13:01.577 --> 13:03.476
-I WENT TO THIS PARTY LAST WEEK.
-MM-HMM?

13:03.656 --> 13:05.339
AT THIS GUY,
DEREK'S HOUSE,

13:07.239 --> 13:08.840
AND HE WAS REALLY SWEET,
YOU KNOW?

13:10.110 --> 13:12.924
SO WE WERE TALKING,
AND AT ONE POINT, UM,

13:13.714 --> 13:16.596
WE GO UPSTAIRS,
JUST TO TALK,

13:18.776 --> 13:20.939
EXCEPT HE DOESN'T
WANT TO TALK.

13:22.089 --> 13:23.252
WHAT?

13:24.862 --> 13:26.104
SO, WE'RE KISSING,

13:27.274 --> 13:28.860
AND BEFORE I KNOW IT,
HE'S...

13:30.240 --> 13:31.321
HE'S GOT ME ON THE BED,

13:32.121 --> 13:33.421
AND HE'S ON TOP OF ME,

13:36.868 --> 13:38.742
AND I CAN'T MOVE MY ARMS.

13:41.042 --> 13:42.178
I CAN'T MOVE,

13:43.648 --> 13:44.985
SO I TELL HIM NO,

13:47.245 --> 13:48.725
BUT BEFORE I KNOW IT,
HE'S...

13:50.165 --> 13:51.665
HE'S UNDOING MY PANTS,

13:52.535 --> 13:53.628
AND I TELL HIM NO,

13:54.538 --> 13:56.685
BUT HE JUST KEEPS ON
UNTIL I HAVE TO...

13:57.845 --> 13:59.108
I HAVE TO KNEE HIM,
YOU KNOW,

14:00.268 --> 14:01.527
JUST TO GET HIM TO STOP.

14:02.067 --> 14:06.854
JUST TO MAKE HIM STOP,
BECAUSE IF I HADN'T,

14:06.854 --> 14:07.932
HE WOULD HAVE...

14:09.672 --> 14:10.815
HE WOULD HAVE--

14:10.815 --> 14:14.514
SHH. IT'S OK.

14:16.364 --> 14:17.598
IT'S GONNA BE OK.

14:19.258 --> 14:20.328
HOW?

14:21.728 --> 14:25.279
OH, GOD. WELL, UM,

14:28.441 --> 14:30.442
FIRST OF ALL,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO REPORT HIM

14:31.442 --> 14:33.740
TO THE SCHOOL
AND TO HIS PARENTS.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.405
WHAT?

14:35.405 --> 14:36.536
CLAUDIA,
YOU HAVE TO.

14:36.536 --> 14:39.521
THIS GUY, HE...
HE ASSAULTED YOU.

14:40.321 --> 14:41.714
I'LL COME IN WITH
YOU IF YOU WANT.

14:42.194 --> 14:44.762
THIS IS JUST WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO TELL ANYONE.

14:44.762 --> 14:46.851
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
HE'S DONE THIS TO, CLAUD,

14:46.851 --> 14:50.159
AND IF YOU DON'T REPORT HIM,
I PROMISE YOU, YOU WON'T BE THE LAST.

14:58.819 --> 14:59.954
COULD WE JUST...

15:02.214 --> 15:04.042
COULD WE NOT TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE?

15:06.305 --> 15:07.567
OK, I'M SORRY.

15:09.047 --> 15:12.256
I'M SORRY.
[SIGHS]

15:12.816 --> 15:14.994
JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL TALK TO SOMEONE, OK?

15:24.266 --> 15:26.272
THERE HE IS,
20 MINUTES LATE.

15:27.902 --> 15:30.464
I HAD TO DROP MY WIFE OFF AT WORK,
AND WE SHARE THE TRUCK.

15:31.154 --> 15:33.158
YOU CAN SEE HOW SERIOUSLY
HE TAKES THIS.

15:34.572 --> 15:36.169
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
SOMETHING FOR ME TO SIGN.

15:36.419 --> 15:38.068
-WHERE IS IT?
-NOT QUITE READY YET.

15:40.078 --> 15:41.088
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:41.318 --> 15:42.689
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH
THIS, THAT'S WHAT.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.692
-SYLVIA--
-I WANT HIM TO SAY THAT HE'S SORRY,

15:45.692 --> 15:49.435
AND I WANT THAT ON
THIS PIECE OF PAPER THAT HE SIGNS.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.352
YOU WANT ME
TO APOLOGIZE?

15:53.352 --> 15:55.407
-YOU BETCHA.
-FORGET IT.

15:55.492 --> 15:56.780
CHARLIE, CALM DOWN.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.155
NO, NO, SHE'S THE ONE.
I MEAN, LOOK WHAT SHE'S DOING.

15:59.176 --> 16:01.037
I'M LOSING MY JOB HERE BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T WANT

16:01.074 --> 16:03.232
TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR MYRA'S PROBLEMS?

16:03.232 --> 16:05.345
THIS, FROM A MAN
WHO TAKES ADVANTAGE OF CHILDREN.

16:05.355 --> 16:07.236
OH, YOU KNOW
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

16:07.236 --> 16:09.499
WHY OFFER A DEAL
IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY?

16:09.499 --> 16:12.806
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT MYRA
TO BE IN THE SAME COURTROOM AS YOU.

16:13.236 --> 16:14.939
I'M PROTECTING HER
FROM FACING--

16:14.939 --> 16:16.143
PROTECTING HER?

16:17.213 --> 16:21.044
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS?
WHERE WERE YOU WHEN MYRA HAD TO GET DRUNK

16:21.074 --> 16:23.330
IN SOME PARK TO GET SOMEONE TO PAY
ATTENTION TO HER

16:23.490 --> 16:26.227
-OR TO STEAL STUFF FROM A DRUGSTORE?
-CHARLIE, STOP.

16:26.255 --> 16:28.567
-I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS FROM HIM.
-SYLVIA, PLEASE

16:28.692 --> 16:30.520
MARY ANNE, THIS IS
MY LIFE HERE.

16:30.520 --> 16:33.088
I THINK I CAN CLARIFY
THIS FOR EVERYONE.

16:33.938 --> 16:35.546
CHARLIE, JUST ANSWER
THIS QUESTION.

16:36.406 --> 16:38.849
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME
YOU HAD CONCERNS FOR MYRA?

16:38.989 --> 16:40.093
LATE OCTOBER, RIGHT?

16:41.503 --> 16:42.532
YES, BUT I MEAN,
WHAT IS THAT--

16:42.532 --> 16:44.448
AND YOU KNEW IT WASN'T
YOUR JOB TO INTERVENE,

16:44.708 --> 16:48.226
YOU KNEW YOU SHOULD HAVE
REPORTED YOUR CONCERNS TO SOCIAL SERVICES.

16:49.016 --> 16:50.844
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YES, BUT--

16:50.844 --> 16:52.621
IS IT FAIR TO SAY
THAT YOU REGRET

16:52.801 --> 16:54.765
NOT FOLLOWING
PROPER PROCEDURE?

16:56.395 --> 16:57.913
IN SOME WAYS,
I GUESS, BUT I--

16:57.963 --> 16:59.767
HOW ABOUT LANGUAGE
TO THAT EFFECT, THAT HE

16:59.777 --> 17:01.812
REGRETS
HIS HANDLING OF THIS?

17:02.182 --> 17:03.225
WILL THAT WORK?

17:03.795 --> 17:04.882
MARY ANNE, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:04.902 --> 17:06.334
CHARLIE,
THAT'S ENOUGH.

17:08.394 --> 17:09.398
IS THAT GONNA
SETTLE THIS?

17:15.711 --> 17:17.828
I AM SO SORRY,
CLAUDIA.

17:19.973 --> 17:23.576
GOD, HOW CAN GUYS
DO THAT, YOU KNOW?

17:24.356 --> 17:26.910
THEY JUST GET DRUNK
AND BECOME THESE, LIKE,

17:26.950 --> 17:29.326
TOTALLY OTHER PEOPLE,
AND THEN WE'RE SUPPOSED

17:29.356 --> 17:32.163
TO JUST FORGIVE THEM AND
PRETEND LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

17:33.633 --> 17:34.858
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.

17:37.234 --> 17:38.501
MAYBE WE SHOULD
TELL SOMEBODY.

17:38.501 --> 17:39.612
OH, LIKE WHO?

17:40.502 --> 17:43.954
I DON'T KNOW.
THE SCHOOL OR...

17:44.724 --> 17:45.812
OR DEREK'S PARENTS?

17:45.812 --> 17:48.989
WAIT. WAIT,
YOU MEAN REPORT HIM?

17:50.579 --> 17:51.779
SERIOUSLY?

17:54.865 --> 17:58.216
COME ON. IF--
IF YOU REPORT HIM,

17:58.216 --> 18:00.000
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING
HE TRIED TO,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.132
YOU KNOW.

18:01.132 --> 18:03.966
ALEXA? HE DID.

18:05.896 --> 18:08.639
HE GOT DRUNK,
AND HE MADE A MISTAKE,

18:09.059 --> 18:13.362
WHICH HE ADMITTED.
I MEAN, IF YOU REPORT THIS,

18:13.362 --> 18:14.754
YOU COULD, LIKE,
RUIN HIS LIFE.

18:15.464 --> 18:16.930
[WHISPERING]
What about my life here?

18:17.740 --> 18:19.411
You're supposed
to be my friend, too.

18:19.411 --> 18:21.394
WHY DO YOU THINK
I'M SAYING THIS?

18:22.284 --> 18:23.397
I MEAN...

18:24.547 --> 18:26.505
DO YOU REALLY WANT
THE WHOLE SCHOOL

18:26.505 --> 18:28.940
DEBATING IF YOU'RE
A TEASE OR A SLUT?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.990
I MEAN, I'M SORRY,

18:32.990 --> 18:36.416
BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE SEX,
YOU DIDN'T GET HURT--

18:36.476 --> 18:37.908
I TOLD YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.212
AND I BELIEVE YOU,

18:40.552 --> 18:41.803
BUT NOT EVERYONE WILL.

18:47.197 --> 18:48.832
SO THEN THE FIRST THING
I SHOULD TELL YOU

18:48.832 --> 18:50.616
ABOUT THANKSGIVING
AT MY HOUSE IS,

18:50.806 --> 18:52.575
DON'T ASK BAILEY
ABOUT HIS COOKING,

18:52.575 --> 18:54.236
'CAUSE ONCE YOU
GET HIM STARTED, HE'LL NEVER STOP--

18:54.266 --> 18:56.013
CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN
ONE THING TO ME,

18:56.673 --> 18:59.234
SO I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
WHO MY AUDIENCE IS?

19:00.795 --> 19:01.975
WHO'S THE ACT FOR?

19:03.035 --> 19:04.369
THE ACT?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:04.369 --> 19:06.197

UH, IGNORE HIM.

19:06.197 --> 19:07.807
WHAT ACT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:08.227 --> 19:10.665
THE HAPPY FAMILY ACT.
WHO'S IT FOR?

19:11.625 --> 19:12.943
YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

19:13.263 --> 19:14.510
OR IS IT FOR YOU, TOO?

19:15.050 --> 19:16.076
IS IT FOR ME?

19:16.076 --> 19:17.817
-LOOK, CAN WE JUST IGNORE THIS?
-THERE IS NO ACT, BRIAN,

19:19.776 --> 19:20.820
YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
ON TURNING INTO THIS.

19:20.820 --> 19:21.995

JUST LET HIM--

19:21.995 --> 19:24.171
YEAH? WHAT WOULD
"THIS" BE?

19:24.511 --> 19:25.999
YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOU
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

19:25.999 --> 19:27.436
WHY DON'T YOU SAY IT,
'CAUSE I'M REALLY GETTING SICK

19:27.436 --> 19:29.046

SARCASM THING.

19:29.046 --> 19:30.830
OK, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR PICK?

19:30.830 --> 19:32.832
YOU'RE HALF MY DAD'S AGE.

19:32.832 --> 19:35.922
YOU'RE TELLING ME
HOW TO BEHAVE IN MY OWN HOUSE.

19:36.472 --> 19:39.321
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU EXISTED UNTIL YESTERDAY, AND--

19:39.391 --> 19:40.797
[DOOR SLAMS]

19:43.909 --> 19:45.192

ISN'T WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

19:55.682 --> 19:56.809

20:15.658 --> 20:18.874
SO, WHAT'S NEXT? I MEAN, WHEN DO THEY
WANT YOU TO LEAVE?

20:20.184 --> 20:22.753
I ACTUALLY--I HAVEN'T
SIGNED IT YET.

20:23.443 --> 20:26.460
OH, OK.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.144

TO GET THIS OVER WITH, BUT...

20:33.623 --> 20:34.682

20:35.112 --> 20:37.370
UM, I WENT
TO THE DOCTOR TODAY.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.259
IS EVERYTHING OK?

20:52.478 --> 20:54.489
I WAS HAVING
SOME CRAMPING, SO...

20:56.249 --> 20:58.205
IT JUST FELT KIND
OF WEIRD, SO I WENT IN,

20:59.185 --> 21:03.167
AND DR. VASQUEZ TOOK SOME TESTS,
AND THEY CAME BACK.

BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY
PREGNANT, YOU KNOW, CHARLIE?

THAT I ABANDONED HER,

BAILEY?

33:17.020 --> 33:18.598
WERE YOU JUST GONNA...

33:18.918 --> 33:19.963
RING AND RUN?

33:21.073 --> 33:22.966
I'M SORRY...UH...

33:22.966 --> 33:24.624
IT'S LATE. I SHOULD
HAVE CALLED FIRST.

33:25.614 --> 33:26.651
WERE YOU SLEEPING?

33:30.952 --> 33:32.410
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:33.350 --> 33:35.232
I'M SORRY. I JUST...

33:36.762 --> 33:39.148
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW THAT...

33:41.018 --> 33:43.029
THAT I USED TO BE
A LOT OF FUN.

33:44.609 --> 33:46.900
SERIOUSLY.
SERIOUSLY, I WAS.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.270
I MEAN,
NOT SERIOUSLY...

33:50.560 --> 33:52.759
I MEAN, YES, I WAS...
BUT--

34:26.982 --> 34:28.116
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

34:29.176 --> 34:30.407
WE NEED TO TALK.

34:31.077 --> 34:32.187
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

34:32.246 --> 34:33.906
MYRA CAME TO THE HOUSE.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

34:34.386 --> 34:35.386
IS THIS A THREAT?

34:35.386 --> 34:36.996
-ARE YOU THREATENING ME?
-YOU KNOW WHY SHE CAME?

34:36.996 --> 34:38.607
SHE CAME BECAUSE
YOU WON'T LISTEN TO HER.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.217
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL THE POLICE?

34:40.217 --> 34:41.911
SHE TOLD ME THAT
I'M INNOCENT, SYLVIA.

34:42.611 --> 34:44.062
AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S
GOING TO SAY TO A JUDGE.

34:44.092 --> 34:46.789
SO YOU CAN IGNORE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER,
BUT YOU CAN'T IGNORE ME.

34:47.589 --> 34:48.704
WHAT DO
YOU WANT?

34:51.527 --> 34:52.724
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:53.603 --> 34:54.922
I DON'T KNOW.

34:55.723 --> 34:57.974
BECAUSE COMING OVER HERE,
AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO ME...

35:00.785 --> 35:02.805
BUT THE TRUTH IS,
WE BOTH WANT THE SAME THING.

35:03.295 --> 35:04.941
WE WANT TO PROTECT
THE PEOPLE THAT WE LOVE.

35:06.391 --> 35:08.202
SO I GUESS THAT'S
WHAT I WANT FROM YOU.

35:08.202 --> 35:09.377
DO THAT.

35:09.377 --> 35:10.692
I AM.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

35:11.072 --> 35:12.862
NO, YOU'RE NOT. NOT IF SHE'S STILL
COMING TO ME FOR HELP.

35:12.872 --> 35:14.329
YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE PROTECTING YOURSELF...

35:14.849 --> 35:16.732
FROM--FROM ME,
FROM THE TRUTH,

35:16.732 --> 35:17.996
WHATEVER IT IS,
I DON'T KNOW.

35:20.356 --> 35:22.326
BUT IT'S TIME TO LOOK
AFTER YOUR FAMILY, SYLVIA.

35:24.526 --> 35:25.938
LOOK AFTER
YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

35:38.076 --> 35:39.172
HEY.

35:41.332 --> 35:42.377
HEY.

35:42.387 --> 35:43.478
UH, HOW YOU DOING?

35:45.418 --> 35:46.517
GOOD.

35:47.907 --> 35:49.499
I WAS JUST...

35:50.139 --> 35:51.701
A LITTLE BIT HUNG OVER.

35:53.031 --> 35:54.152
YOU?

35:54.182 --> 35:56.288
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. YEAH.

35:56.728 --> 35:59.054
LAST NIGHT, THAT DIDN'T
MAKE MUCH SENSE, DID IT?

35:59.424 --> 36:00.583
YOU AND ME? THAT WAS--

36:01.323 --> 36:03.866
WELL, ACTUALLY, I'VE NEVER REALLY DONE
MUCH THAT MAKES SENSE.

36:04.016 --> 36:06.064
SO, UH...PROBABLY NOT.

36:06.974 --> 36:09.606
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
BUT, UM...

36:11.286 --> 36:12.918
WE COULD STILL BE FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

36:12.918 --> 36:14.311
WELL, YEAH,

36:14.401 --> 36:15.743
NO, UH, YEAH.

36:18.163 --> 36:19.437
SO, UM...

36:23.657 --> 36:25.061
MAYBE WE COULD, UH...

36:26.561 --> 36:28.993
YOU KNOW, WE COULD GO TO
A--A MOVIE SOMETIME TOGETHER?

36:29.883 --> 36:31.177
YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?

36:31.207 --> 36:32.824
AND NO BIG DEAL, YOU KNOW.
JUST AS FRIENDS.

36:32.864 --> 36:34.008
-RIGHT, JUST AS FRIENDS.
-YEAH.

36:36.097 --> 36:37.334
OK. GOOD.

36:37.334 --> 36:38.885
THEN I'LL JUST LET
YOU GET BACK TO WORK.

36:40.095 --> 36:41.671
AND I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

36:50.304 --> 36:52.218
OK, GOOD. SO...

36:52.698 --> 36:53.916
A MOVIE SOMETIME.

36:53.916 --> 36:55.265
A MOVIE, YEAH.
RIGHT.

37:15.699 --> 37:16.895
CLAUD.

37:17.025 --> 37:18.332
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

37:18.332 --> 37:19.681
YEAH.

37:19.681 --> 37:21.065
YEAH, I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY OUT.

37:21.745 --> 37:23.293
YOU DISAPPEARED
LAST NIGHT.

37:23.293 --> 37:24.381
I WENT TO BED
EARLY, YOU KNOW.

37:24.381 --> 37:25.835
TOO MUCH TURKEY,
I GUESS.

37:25.885 --> 37:28.254
SO YOU NEVER TOLD ME.
HOW DID EVERYTHING GO AT SCHOOL?

37:29.224 --> 37:30.284
-FINE.
-YEAH?

37:30.304 --> 37:31.606
WHAT'D
THE PRINCIPAL SAY?

37:32.116 --> 37:33.211
NOTHING.

37:35.824 --> 37:36.914
I DIDN'T TELL HER.

37:37.524 --> 37:39.353
WHAT? CLAUDIA--

37:39.353 --> 37:41.311
NO, JULIA, I KNOW HOW
YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS.

37:41.771 --> 37:42.991
I DO, BUT I...

37:44.991 --> 37:46.991
I WANT THIS TO JUST
GO AWAY, YOU KNOW?

37:47.491 --> 37:50.233
IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY
'CAUSE YOU DECIDE TO KEEP QUIET, CLAUDIA.

37:50.233 --> 37:51.381
BELIEVE ME.
RIGHT.

37:52.041 --> 37:53.552
YOU'VE BEEN THERE,
BUT...

37:54.092 --> 37:55.447
THIS IS MY LIFE, JULIA.

37:56.117 --> 37:57.501
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

37:57.501 --> 37:59.220
WHO'S GONNA HAVE
TO SPEND THE NEXT YEAR AND A HALF

37:59.260 --> 38:01.814
WITH 1,000 PEOPLE DISCUSSING
IF YOU'RE SOME SLUT.

38:02.504 --> 38:04.032
OR A LIAR. OR WORSE.

38:04.522 --> 38:06.380
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M NOT.

38:07.110 --> 38:08.893
BUT I'M ALSO NOT THE ONE
WHO'S GOING TO HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

38:08.913 --> 38:10.340
RUNNING INTO DEREK
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

38:10.340 --> 38:11.718
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO DEAL WITH THAT, CLAUDIA?

38:12.168 --> 38:14.152
I GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, WON'T I?

38:14.692 --> 38:16.108
MAKE LIKE
IT NEVER HAPPENED.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.218
FOR ALL I KNOW...

38:20.778 --> 38:22.163
MAYBE IT NEVER DID.

38:31.448 --> 38:33.537
I DON'T KNOW.
WHATEVER YOU FEEL LIKE.

38:33.537 --> 38:36.508
WE COULD, UH, YOU KNOW,
DINNER AND A MOVIE...

38:36.548 --> 38:38.535
OR WE COULD JUST ORDER IN.

38:42.894 --> 38:46.115
UH, TRACY, CAN YOU
HANG ON ONE SECOND? OK, THANKS.

38:50.032 --> 38:51.056
THOSE AREN'T...

38:51.816 --> 38:53.165
THEY ARE.

38:54.993 --> 38:56.168
THEY'RE LIKE SUPER WOMEN.

38:56.168 --> 38:57.213
YEAH, AND
THEY'RE HUNGRY,

38:57.213 --> 38:58.519
SO GRAB YOUR COAT.

38:58.519 --> 38:59.781
-NO, WILL, I CAN'T JUST--
-NO, NO.

38:59.781 --> 39:00.860
THERE'S NO "CAN'T."

39:00.900 --> 39:02.523
YOU'RE BETWEEN SHIFTS,
I TIMED THIS ON PURPOSE.

39:02.523 --> 39:04.133
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I HAVE PLANS.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.812
YES, WITH TRIBECA THERE.
SHE'S FROM NEW YORK.

39:07.412 --> 39:09.378
AND SHE'S VERY INTERESTED
IN THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS, BAY.

39:09.643 --> 39:11.234
SHE EATS OUT
ALL THE TIME.

39:17.363 --> 39:18.565
OK, JUST GIVE ME A SECOND.

39:19.365 --> 39:21.411
TRACY...HEY,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:21.411 --> 39:23.021
SOMETHING'S COME UP HERE
AT THE RESTAURANT.

39:23.021 --> 39:24.153
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
WORK LATE TONIGHT,

39:24.153 --> 39:25.415
SO CAN WE MAYBE
RESCHEDULE?

39:27.257 --> 39:28.685
UH, HOW LATE?

39:32.592 --> 39:33.636
I THINK, PRETTY LATE.

39:34.816 --> 39:36.501
JUST COME BY WHENEVER?

39:36.711 --> 39:37.845
ARE YOU SURE?

39:40.125 --> 39:41.387
OK, THAT'S PERFECT.

39:41.387 --> 39:42.824
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

39:42.824 --> 39:44.216
OK, BYE.

39:46.871 --> 39:48.080
HAVING FUN YET?

39:49.570 --> 39:51.657
WILL. YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

39:57.795 --> 39:59.536
15 MINUTES
THEY SAID.

39:59.536 --> 40:00.537
REALLY?

40:00.537 --> 40:02.051
YOU WANT TO JUST GO HOME?

40:02.101 --> 40:03.801
NO. NO, LET'S WAIT.

40:03.801 --> 40:05.107
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

40:05.107 --> 40:06.717
I WANT TO CELEBRATE.

40:09.807 --> 40:11.265
SO SHE WHAT...

40:11.275 --> 40:13.940
SHE JUST DROPPED EVERYTHING
WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION?

40:15.160 --> 40:16.663
MARY ANNE SAID THAT, UH,

40:18.163 --> 40:19.600
SHE EVEN APOLOGIZED.

40:19.600 --> 40:21.311
TO HER, NOT TO YOU.

40:22.211 --> 40:25.724
LOOK, THAT'S NOT
WHY WE'RE HERE, OK?

40:26.824 --> 40:28.943
WE'RE HERE BECAUSE
WE GOT PREGNANT.

40:30.463 --> 40:31.838
WHICH MEANS
THAT WE WILL AGAIN.

40:32.308 --> 40:34.136
I WANT TO START TRYING
AGAIN RIGHT AWAY.

40:34.406 --> 40:35.780
CHARLIE, GOD...

40:36.530 --> 40:37.642
I DON'T KNOW...

40:38.532 --> 40:40.649
I MEAN, MAYBE
WE SHOULD WAIT.

40:41.649 --> 40:42.857
THIS WAS HARD.

40:43.537 --> 40:44.765
YOU KNOW, THE IVF...

40:45.175 --> 40:47.889
ON TOP OF ALL THAT,
ALL THIS STUFF WITH MYRA AND THE SCHOOL...

40:47.889 --> 40:49.455
YEAH, BUT
THAT'S OVER NOW.

40:49.755 --> 40:52.061
WE FOUGHT IT AND
WE CAME OUT ALL RIGHT.

40:52.121 --> 40:55.407
SO...LET'S BE
ALL RIGHT.

40:59.603 --> 41:02.401
MAYBE BEFORE WE START
THE SHOTS AGAIN...

41:02.421 --> 41:06.555
WE COULD PRACTICE
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

41:07.355 --> 41:09.171
IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS.

41:38.730 --> 41:40.347
YOU'RE TAKING OFF?
IT'S PRETTY EARLY.

41:41.377 --> 41:42.596
YEAH. I WAS JUST, UH,

41:43.046 --> 41:44.334
WRITING YOU GUYS A NOTE.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.123
SO YOU'RE GOING
BACK TO SCHOOL?

41:47.903 --> 41:49.039
YEAH.

41:50.539 --> 41:52.561
DAD TELL YOU ABOUT OUR
LITTLE CHAT LAST NIGHT?

41:54.291 --> 41:55.473
A LITTLE.

41:55.783 --> 41:56.958
YEAH, IT WAS WEIRD.

41:57.238 --> 41:59.082
YOU KNOW, HE BASICALLY
DREW THE LINE.

42:00.552 --> 42:02.137
TOLD ME
HE'D MAKE ME PAY BACK

42:02.137 --> 42:04.000
EVERY CENT
OF LOST TUITION...

42:04.930 --> 42:06.059
UNLESS I WENT BACK.

42:07.769 --> 42:08.970
SO I AM.

42:09.290 --> 42:10.484
WHY IS THAT WEIRD?

42:10.914 --> 42:13.235
WELL, IT WAS KINDA
LIKE HE'D BEEN COACHED.

42:13.235 --> 42:16.630
LIKE I WAS ARGUING
WITH SOMEONE ELSE...

42:18.523 --> 42:19.894
LIKE YOU.

42:28.990 --> 42:30.064
SO, UH...

42:30.974 --> 42:32.689
YOU ARE WAY TOO YOUNG
FOR HIM,

42:32.689 --> 42:33.690
YOU KNOW THAT.

42:33.690 --> 42:35.137
I KNOW YOU THINK SO.

42:35.987 --> 42:37.346
YEAH, WELL...

42:37.536 --> 42:40.239
I ALSO THINK...
HE'S LUCKY.

42:43.004 --> 42:44.227
THANK YOU.

42:48.229 --> 42:49.314
YOU KNOW WHAT?

42:49.314 --> 42:50.793
HAVE A SAFE TRIP BACK.

42:57.235 --> 42:58.453
BRIAN, UM...

43:01.503 --> 43:02.624
I'LL SEE YOU.
