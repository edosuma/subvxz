10:50.016 --> 10:51.817

earlier today.

- What did you just do?!

19:32.404 --> 19:33.639
- I smashed the chip.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.175
Then blew the dust like this...

19:37.242 --> 19:39.678
- Why?!

19:39.745 --> 19:41.680
- It was a grand gesture.

19:41.747 --> 19:43.482
- I thought you were
gonna give it to him!

19:43.549 --> 19:46.351
- No, I was
sacrificing it to show him

19:46.418 --> 19:48.954
that our friendship means more
to me than the contest does,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.355
plus I threw in that sick pun--

19:50.422 --> 19:52.190
- You could have
just given it to him!

19:52.257 --> 19:53.759
- Ohhh yeah.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.327
And he probably would
have taken us with him anyway.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.629
- Exactly!

19:57.696 --> 20:00.465
- Well either way,
it didn't work.

20:00.532 --> 20:03.368
- Actually, it did.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.511
- Yeah, what?

20:12.578 --> 20:13.979
- Are you wearing makeup?

20:14.046 --> 20:15.547
- Of course I am!

you earlier today...

20:33.231 --> 20:36.368
but you never should have asked
me to kill my friends.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.439

am I right?

came up for me before.

going on here.
