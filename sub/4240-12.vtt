two captains, guys.
- Why two?

11:10.962 --> 11:14.006
We're fine with having
Rachel represent us
in the Thunderclap by herself.

11:14.090 --> 11:18.302
- We'd actually prefer it.
- [School Bell Rings]

11:18.386 --> 11:22.139
The worst part is that after
all this time, they're still
embarrassed to be in Glee Club.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.516
They still
see themselves as losers.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.854
[Sighs] I just need to get
one of them to step up
and become cocaptain.

11:28.938 --> 11:32.733
Well, maybe you should
let them use the captain
they already elected.

11:32.817 --> 11:36.403
You know, sometimes
things sound a lot different
coming from a peer,

11:36.488 --> 11:38.989
even if that peer
is as annoying as Rachel.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.116
[Chuckles]

11:41.201 --> 11:44.703
None of this
is gonna matter
if they win at sectionals.

11:44.788 --> 11:47.998
I'm really sorry
I can't be there.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.211
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

11:52.295 --> 11:56.340
I-I kind of think Ken
scheduled your wedding
the same day on purpose,

11:56.424 --> 11:59.802
you know,
so— so you couldn't go.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.554
[Laughs]
Why would he do that?

12:02.639 --> 12:08.602
Come on. We-We both know
how he feels about
our... relationship.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.024
I'm marrying Ken, Will.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.235
Look, I know that I've-

12:16.319 --> 12:19.947
I've definitely given him
reason in the past
to be jealous.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.324
But I need you to know
that I'm done with that now.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.493
Ken has a lot of flaws.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.912
He has 74 flaws
as of yesterday.

12:26.996 --> 12:31.250
But you know what?
He's not vindictive.
He's actually a very good man.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.128
He is kind, and he is great
with the students here
at McKinley.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.298
We have that in common.
And yes, it's true his hygiene
could be a lot better.

12:38.383 --> 12:43.387
But he is absolutely
full of compassion, and-

12:43.471 --> 12:46.348
Well, that is why
I'm marrying him.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.893
You're right.

12:54.649 --> 12:56.900
I was out of line.

Oh, yeah, Rach.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.292
Sit down.

13:13.376 --> 13:16.003
So, how's the new
captaincy going?

13:16.087 --> 13:19.089
I-I think that my
unanimous election gave me
a very strong mandate...

13:19.215 --> 13:21.884
to shake things up.
Great. Well,

13:23.386 --> 13:25.429
I have a job for you,
Captain.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.227

13:32.312 --> 13:34.563
But you have
so many great ideas,

13:34.647 --> 13:36.773
no reason you shouldn't
have some help
pushing them through.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.193

a trusty lieutenant.

No problem.
I'm on it.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.872
Um, I can't be cocaptain.
No time. Kwanzaa.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.334

You know I love Glee Club.
I just don't know
why I have to represent it.

Because you're
a leader, Finn.

They stick their necks out

we're not even gonna

is different.

this script is brilliant.

23:15.144 --> 23:18.438
But we're a glee club,
and we should perform.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.399
Perform the lines
as I wrote them.

23:21.484 --> 23:25.528
Wait a minute, Dennis.

Terri, have you seen
my pocket square?

25:37.328 --> 25:39.662
Terri?

25:41.290 --> 25:43.499
[Sighs]

26:13.155 --> 26:16.449
Terri.
A pocket square's gonna
make you look like Ted Knight.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.994
What is this?

26:21.372 --> 26:23.998
It's a pregnancy pad.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.669
They have them
at the maternity stores
for trying on clothes...

26:27.753 --> 26:29.837
so you can see
how you're gonna look
when you're showing.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.675
Kendra stole it for me
so I can see if any of her
old clothes would fit—

26:36.053 --> 26:37.971
Pick up your shirt.

26:38.055 --> 26:41.015
What? No.

26:42.476 --> 26:45.853
Pick up your shirt.
You're scaring me, Will.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.525
Now, think about
what you're accusing me of.

26:50.609 --> 26:55.238
Think about it and turn around
and go find your pocket square.

- [Gasps]
- Why did you do this to us?
I don't understand.

27:14.049 --> 27:16.134
I thought you
were leaving me.

27:16.218 --> 27:19.846
You're so different, Will.
We both know it. I can feel you.
You're pulling away from me.

27:19.930 --> 27:23.474
Because I've started standing up
to you, trying to make this
a relationship of equals?

27:23.559 --> 27:25.601
No, because
of the damn Glee Club.

27:25.686 --> 27:29.230
Ever since you started it,
you just walk around
like you're better than me.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.858
I should be allowed
to feel good about myself.

27:31.942 --> 27:37.613
Who are we kidding, Will?
This marriage works because you
don't feel good about yourself.

27:37.698 --> 27:40.658
This marriage works
because I love you,

27:40.784 --> 27:43.328
because I've always
accepted you.
No.

27:43.412 --> 27:47.957
- Good and bad.
- You love the girl
you met when you were 15.

27:48.042 --> 27:51.836
- I'm not that girl.
- You've made yourself
a stranger to me now.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.339
No.
Are you happy?
Are you satisfied?

27:54.423 --> 27:56.674
It didn't start as a lie.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.177
I really thought
I was pregnant.

27:59.261 --> 28:02.764
And then the doctor,
he said it was
a hysterical pregnancy,

28:02.848 --> 28:05.058
and I just panicked.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.101
[Sobs]

28:08.103 --> 28:10.355
This is insane.

28:10.439 --> 28:14.067
I mean,
wh-what were you gonna do
when the due date came?

28:15.986 --> 28:17.945
Quinn Fabray.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.574
It was so perfect.

28:21.658 --> 28:24.202
She didn't want hers,
and I needed one.

28:24.286 --> 28:28.039
I had the doctor use
her ultrasound DVD...

28:28.123 --> 28:30.166
at your appointment
that you came to.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.418
[Exhales]

28:32.503 --> 28:34.629
I loved you, Terri.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.884
- I really loved you.
- I'm so sorry, Will.

28:39.968 --> 28:41.969
I'm so sorry.

28:42.054 --> 28:45.390
Do you remember
that appointment?
Do you remember what we said?

28:45.474 --> 28:47.600
That at that moment,
no matter what happened,
we loved each other.

28:47.684 --> 28:51.312
We can get
that feeling back again.
You can love me back, Will.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.481
Please, Will.
Please don't go.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.691
Please don't go!
Please!

29:03.158 --> 29:05.076
Oh, God.

Ohio Board of Statewide
Holiday Planning?

30:24.656 --> 30:26.782
All I want is just
one day a year...

30:26.867 --> 30:30.661
where I'm not visually
assaulted by uglies and fatties.

30:30.746 --> 30:33.456
Seriously, Ohio,
these retinas need a day off.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.251
So here's the dream.
Friday after Christmas,
which I have off,

30:37.336 --> 30:39.337
if you’re hideous,
stay at home.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.380
Spend the entire day
watching home videos...

30:41.465 --> 30:44.509
of a time when you
weren't too repulsive
for me to ever wanna look at.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.303
At that's how Sue sees it.
[Whistle Blows]

30:47.387 --> 30:51.682
- Rod.
- Slammin', Sue.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.060
We'll be right back.

30:54.144 --> 30:57.522
Hey, Andrea,
that "Sue's Corner"
I just did—

30:57.606 --> 30:59.941
I was talking about you.

[Rachel] Who says
finding a mattress
can't be fun?

31:03.529 --> 31:06.239
At Mattress Land,
we have mattresses
of all shapes and sizes...

31:06.323 --> 31:08.616
at prices that won't
break your pocketbook.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.618
No credit? No problem.

31:10.702 --> 31:14.247
Mattress Land has
a no-hassle financing
of 12.9%...

31:14.331 --> 31:17.166
with no money down
and no payments till next year.

31:17.251 --> 31:19.293
You'll jump for joy
at our prices.

Come on down
to Mattress Land!

31:21.755 --> 31:25.424
- [School Bell Rings]
- Coach Sylvester,
we need to talk.

31:25.509 --> 31:27.885
Oh, I got nothing
to say to you, preggo.

31:27.970 --> 31:31.013
The Cheerios
photo's tomorrow, and I
want back on that squad.

31:31.098 --> 31:34.600
Oh, is that what you want?
Well, what I wanted
was a head cheerleader...

31:34.685 --> 31:36.686
who wasn't going to hoist
her legs behind her ears...

31:36.770 --> 31:39.772
in the back seat
of the first station wagon
she could jimmy open,

31:39.856 --> 31:41.899
throwing away any chance
she ever had in life.

31:41.984 --> 31:43.985
It would be good
for the school—

31:44.069 --> 31:46.404
show everyone
that appearances
don't matter.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.240
Sometimes people
have to deal
with a little adversity.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.242
I learned that
in Glee Club.

31:51.326 --> 31:53.244
Well, that little
educational proverb...

31:53.328 --> 31:55.413
must have slithered
from Will Schuester's mouth...

31:55.497 --> 32:00.084
right after his lesson
on how to disqualify
yourselves from sectionals.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.588
What?
Saw your little
commercial last night.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.257
Boy, did you Glee kids
step in it.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.428
Schue, I'm afraid
Sue is right.

32:10.512 --> 32:12.555
You have indeed
stepped in it.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.016
I didn't even know
this was going on.
Of course you didn't, William.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.101
You wouldn't know
if your Glee Club
was using your office...

32:17.185 --> 32:19.145
to breed rabbits
for pets or for food.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.230
You know why?
You're too busy
chasing tail...

32:21.315 --> 32:23.941
and loading your hair
with enormous amounts
of product.

32:24.026 --> 32:25.985
Today it just looks
like you put lard in it.

32:26.069 --> 32:28.279
What are you even
talking about?

32:28.363 --> 32:32.116
Look— Look, the kids
did the commercial to foster
a feeling of unity...

32:32.200 --> 32:35.745
after you— not anyone else-
you got them banned
from the yearbook.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.122
That's what I did, yes.
It was an innocent mistake.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.875
And what if I were to just
innocently murder you, Will?

32:40.959 --> 32:42.918
I'd still have
to go to trial.

32:43.003 --> 32:44.795
Probably get off
with justifiable homicide.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.006
Let me review
the rules for you.

32:47.132 --> 32:50.426
This is crazy.
Amendment 63,
seventh addendum.

32:50.510 --> 32:52.970
"No professional activity
of any kind
will be tolerated,

32:53.055 --> 32:56.390
"and payment
for services rendered
negates amateur status,

32:56.516 --> 32:59.060
triggering immediate
disqualification."
Hey. Hey.

32:59.144 --> 33:03.064
- Hey, hey, hey.
Keep it civil. Keep it simple.
- Hey what, mister?

33:03.148 --> 33:06.609
Keep it simple.
Hey, I am sorry, Schue,
but I cannot let this slide.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.611
But the kids
weren't even paid.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.655
There's
a stack of mattresses
in the choir room...

33:10.739 --> 33:13.074
piled as high as the empty
hair gel bottles...

33:13.200 --> 33:16.369
in the Dumpster
outside your apartment.
We'll give the mattresses back.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.537
Schue, one of those
mattresses was used.

33:18.622 --> 33:20.581
You can't return
a used mattress.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.708
You can't even
donate one to charity.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.252
Lice. Bedbugs.
I looked it up online.

33:25.337 --> 33:28.255
Is there any reason that
you have a soiled mattress
in your office, Will?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.591
Have you and the redhead
become so sexually
depraved...

33:30.676 --> 33:34.512
that you have to commit
your craven acts of adultery
in between classes?

33:34.596 --> 33:37.682
- Wha—
- I slept-
You know, okay, fine.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.725
I slept here, all right?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.436
Excuse me?

33:42.521 --> 33:44.522
[Sighs]

33:46.942 --> 33:48.859
I'm thinking
about leaving my wife.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.861
Oh, I didn't see
that one coming at all.

33:50.946 --> 33:55.783
William, I am very sorry
about your personal troubles,
but my hands are tied.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.952
Sue's right.
You broke the rules.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.038
I cannot fight
the scholastic board.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.624
I'm sorry,
but Glee Club is over.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.462
It's over.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.309
[Sue Thinking]
Dear Journal,

34:22.394 --> 34:27.565
I've finally gotten
Will Schuester and that
Glee Club out of my hair.

34:27.649 --> 34:31.318
This is a day
that will live in infamy.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.947
Once again, I've won.

34:36.491 --> 34:38.492
Miss Sylvester.

34:41.663 --> 34:45.207
It's like looking
at a porno star
in a nun's habit.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.085
I wanted to show you
that it still fits.

34:48.170 --> 34:51.589
My baby bump isn't that bad.
It's just like I had
a big lunch.

34:51.673 --> 34:54.884
Take it off.
You need to get it through
your pregnant head...

34:54.968 --> 34:58.929
there's no way you're getting
in that photo or back
on the Cheerios— end of story.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.682
You're a hypocrite.
Excuse me?

35:01.767 --> 35:05.436
I just heard that you got
Glee Club's amateur status
revoked over a mattress...

35:05.520 --> 35:08.856
while you are constantly
showering the Cheerios
with swag.

35:08.940 --> 35:12.693
I've gotten free shoes,
complimentary tanning,
haircuts.

35:12.778 --> 35:16.155
The season tickets
to Cedar Point?
We sold those on eBay.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.823
For a profit.

35:17.908 --> 35:20.242
It seems to me
that if Figgins found out,

35:20.327 --> 35:22.536
you would get banned
from competition.

35:23.747 --> 35:26.207
Fine. You're back
on the Cheerios.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.459
I'll put you
on full-time
dry-cleaning duty...

35:28.543 --> 35:30.753
and shove you
to the back of the photo
to hide your shame.

35:30.837 --> 35:35.216
I'm not finished.
Glee Club gets
a full-page photo.

35:35.300 --> 35:38.135
- It's not up to me.
- You are giving up...

35:38.220 --> 35:41.222
one of the Cheerios'
six pages,

35:41.306 --> 35:45.267
and you are giving it
to the Glee Club
free of charge.

35:47.020 --> 35:49.522
You know, Q,
I'd forgotten...

35:49.606 --> 35:53.818
just how ruthless
you really are.

35:53.902 --> 35:55.694
You're like
a young Sue Sylvester.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.280
Now get out of my office...

35:58.365 --> 36:00.699
if you can manage to squeeze
through the door without
your water breaking...

36:00.784 --> 36:02.451
all over my new carpet.

36:02.536 --> 36:04.745
You know what?

36:04.830 --> 36:07.832
I don't think I wanna be
a Cheerio after all.

36:07.916 --> 36:11.001
I don't wanna be on a team
where I only appear to belong.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.879
I'd rather be a part of a club
that's proud to have me,

36:13.964 --> 36:16.257
like Glee Club.

36:21.596 --> 36:24.181
[Sighs]
It's my fault.

36:24.266 --> 36:26.141
If I hadn't slept
on that mattress,

36:26.226 --> 36:28.102
we could have just
returned them and moved on.

36:28.228 --> 36:31.564
Hey, can I give you
some advice?
Please.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.858
You need
to give yourself a break.

36:33.984 --> 36:35.860
[Chuckles]
You do. You'll—

36:35.944 --> 36:38.070
You'll figure out
what to do with the kids.
You always do.

36:38.154 --> 36:42.408
But I think right now
you really need to focus
on your own life.

36:42.492 --> 36:45.077
You know, divorce
is a really big deal.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.998
Who said anything
about getting a divorce?

36:50.792 --> 36:55.588
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I just assumed that that's-

36:55.672 --> 36:58.424
Is that
what you would do?

36:58.508 --> 37:00.509
Well, um-
[Laughs]

37:02.762 --> 37:05.723
When I first heard
about what Terri had done,

37:05.807 --> 37:07.808
I thought there should be
some sort of law.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.478
But then when I thought
about it some more,

37:11.563 --> 37:14.732
I thought about
what I would have done...

37:14.816 --> 37:16.942
if I'd felt you
slipping away.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.111
You would never
be that cruel.

37:19.195 --> 37:21.739
You know,
her methods were wrong.

37:21.823 --> 37:24.533
But, um,

37:24.618 --> 37:27.244
I totally understand
her intentions.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.121
[Sighs]

37:31.166 --> 37:33.834
You're a lot to lose, Will.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.798
But we don't wanna go
to sectionals without you.

37:39.883 --> 37:43.510
[Sighs]
It's without me
or not at all.

37:44.638 --> 37:47.306
Look, I was the one
who slept on the mattress,

37:47.390 --> 37:50.726
which means
I accepted them, not you.

37:52.020 --> 37:54.772
Which means I'm disqualified
from competition.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.900
- Not you guys.
- He's taking
the bullet for us.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.027
Solid.

38:01.571 --> 38:05.950
[Sighs]
We have worked too hard for
you guys not to get your shot.

38:06.034 --> 38:08.410
We can't do this
without you, Mr. Schue.

38:08.495 --> 38:11.163
- Hell, we probably
can't do it with you.
- That's not true.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.375
You guys are good.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.544
[Chuckles]
You're really good.

38:17.629 --> 38:21.590
Y-Y-You did "Jump"
for that commercial
without me, right?

38:22.884 --> 38:24.927
[Sighs]
Look,

38:25.011 --> 38:28.806
the best teachers
don't give you
the answers.

38:28.890 --> 38:34.311
They just point the way
and let you make
your own choices,

38:34.396 --> 38:36.397
your own mistakes.

38:38.358 --> 38:41.860
That way,
you get all the glory.

38:43.530 --> 38:45.656
And you deserve it.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.159
[Chuckles]
But if-

38:49.244 --> 38:52.037
if you can't win
without me there,

38:52.122 --> 38:54.707
then I haven't done my job.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.961
We're really sorry,
Mr. Schue.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.005
I know.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.259
I want you guys
to go get gussied up...

39:05.343 --> 39:08.762
and take that
Glee Club photo with pride.

39:08.847 --> 39:12.516
I wanna see a smile
on every one of your faces.

39:12.517 --> 39:12.975
I wanna see a smile
on every one of your faces.
