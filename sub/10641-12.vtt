00:01.669 --> 00:03.636
       Daly: This season...     

00:03.672 --> 00:06.840
    ¶ man, you oughta see her   
         fly-y-y-y-y-y ¶        
        ...The knockouts        
      have been incredible...   

00:06.875 --> 00:08.741
                     Whoo!      
 Yeah!                          

00:08.777 --> 00:09.976
 ¶ there is a house             
 in new orleans ¶               

00:10.011 --> 00:12.445
 Daly: ...As the artists        
 left it all on the stage       

00:12.481 --> 00:14.481
 For a spot                     
 in next week's live shows.     

00:14.516 --> 00:16.950
 That was flawless.             
 You're ready for the lives.    

00:16.985 --> 00:18.218
 You slayed that.               

00:18.253 --> 00:19.752
 Christina: I really thought    
 this was the finale            

00:19.788 --> 00:21.421
 And you just won "the voice."  

00:21.456 --> 00:24.057
 Daly: Our coaches              
 faced impossible decisions.    

00:24.092 --> 00:25.258
 I hate this.                   

00:25.293 --> 00:27.727
 I dare pharrell                
 to make you available to me.   

00:27.762 --> 00:29.329
 -Oh, my god!                   
 -Oh, we got a steal!           

00:29.364 --> 00:32.165
 Daly: And three deserving      
 artists got a second chance    

00:32.200 --> 00:37.303
As christina, pharrell, and adam
each used their only steals,    

00:37.339 --> 00:39.472
 Fortifying their teams.        

00:39.508 --> 00:41.441
 Blake: I'm the only coach      
 with a steal left,             

00:41.476 --> 00:43.676
 And i'm waiting for somebody   
 not like anybody else.         

00:43.712 --> 00:46.112
              Daly:             
   Tonight, the knockouts end.  

00:46.148 --> 00:48.348
          Miley cyrus!          
        Daly: To prepare        
   the remaining team members,  

00:48.383 --> 00:51.684
Our coaches recruited           
one of the most dynamic artists.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.987
  This is my friend miley cyrus,
        in case you didn't know.
[ chuckles ]

20 million records sold,        

00:55.824 --> 00:59.025
Award-winning musician,         
actor, philanthropist...        

00:59.060 --> 01:00.627
¶ i came in                     
like a wrecking ball ¶          

01:00.662 --> 01:03.463
     ...And pop-culture icon    
           miley cyrus.         

01:03.498 --> 01:05.565
     ¶ i'd never hit so hard    
            in love ¶           
       take 'em to church!      

01:05.600 --> 01:09.335
  Having miley as a key adviser 
          is phenomenal.        

01:09.371 --> 01:12.405
       Country background,      
  grammy-nominated, pop music --

01:12.440 --> 01:15.508
       There's no way that      
  you can't take something away.

01:15.544 --> 01:17.911
    She brings in               
  a great expertise.            

01:17.946 --> 01:20.013
  ¶ don't you kno-o-o-o-o-o-w ¶ 

01:20.048 --> 01:22.782
  Stay on that, 'cause then you 
 can get, like, a punch quicker.

01:22.817 --> 01:24.184
  It would just be good for you 
        just to freestyle,      

01:24.219 --> 01:25.685
        Like, creatively.       

01:25.720 --> 01:27.854
                ¶ holding on ¶  

01:27.889 --> 01:30.857
Miley's singing shania.         
    This is crazy.              

01:30.892 --> 01:33.526
  Just was like a different song
   with you singing like that.  

01:33.562 --> 01:35.295
It's night and day.             
          ¶ 'cause what         
     you don't understand ¶     

01:35.330 --> 01:37.096
       Adam: The knockouts      
    is kind of the first look   

01:37.132 --> 01:38.698
      At the kind of artists    
      these guys want to be     

01:38.733 --> 01:40.500
     And if they can make it    
        in this business.       

01:40.535 --> 01:43.803
       ¶ leave your lover ¶     

01:43.838 --> 01:46.339
      ¶ leave her for me ¶      
        daly: The artists       
    will hold nothing back...   

01:46.374 --> 01:51.211
    ¶ is it too late            
    to say sorry no-o-o-o-w ¶   

01:51.246 --> 01:52.946
Daly:                           
...To make it to the live shows.

01:52.981 --> 01:54.814
    Man, it was like            
    it was your song.           

01:54.849 --> 01:56.149
    I loved every second.       

01:56.184 --> 01:57.517
    You steamrolled that.       

01:57.552 --> 01:59.619
 Do you go with storm           
 or do you go with wonder woman?

01:59.654 --> 02:00.687
    Ay-yi-yi.                   

02:00.722 --> 02:02.655
    Daly:                       
    With only one steal left,   

02:02.691 --> 02:05.325
    There is no room for error. 

02:05.360 --> 02:07.327
         We got a steal!        
           [ screams ]          

02:07.362 --> 02:08.561
     [ cheers and applause ]    
         that's so cool.        

02:08.597 --> 02:10.062
         Yeah.                  

02:10.098 --> 02:14.067
   Daly: The final knockouts    
   of season 10 start right now.

02:14.102 --> 02:18.171
    Well, i've got one steal,   
 and i know who i'm using it on.

02:18.206 --> 02:19.305
Oh, yeah?                       
              I'm ready for you.

02:19.341 --> 02:20.506
You ready?                      
                           Yeah.

02:20.542 --> 02:22.408
         I'm not ready for <i> that,</i>
         but i'm ready for --   

02:22.444 --> 02:24.277
     This is gonna be great.    
              Okay.             
 Can i ask you                  
a serious question?             

02:24.312 --> 02:26.279
                           Yeah.
This is dead serious. Why are   
you so obsessed with it?        

02:26.314 --> 02:27.280
I think                         
he wants to lick it.            

02:27.315 --> 02:28.915
      It tastes                 
  like cotton candy.            

02:28.950 --> 02:30.617
       Oh, my god, but it smells
              like sweat.       

02:30.652 --> 02:31.851
                  [ laughs ]    

02:31.886 --> 02:33.953
     Daly: While our coaches    
      head to their chairs,     

02:33.989 --> 02:36.689
       Let's look at adam's     
   first pairing of the night.  

02:36.725 --> 02:39.058
       Adam: Nate and brian     
       are very different.      

02:39.094 --> 02:42.328
    Brian just oozes charisma.  
   Nate's got a beautiful tone. 

02:42.364 --> 02:44.430
           It's tough.          
     Every decision is tough.   

02:44.466 --> 02:46.299
              -Ahh!             
              -Hey!             

02:46.334 --> 02:47.567
              -Hey!             
              -Hey!             

02:47.602 --> 02:49.369
           Miley cyrus!         

02:49.404 --> 02:51.938
       Miley, she's someone     
        who's so original.      

02:51.973 --> 02:55.441
    Just to be in her presence  
     is really an opportunity   

02:55.477 --> 02:57.810
        I'm gonna remember      
     for the rest of my life.   

02:57.846 --> 02:59.279
               I appreciate you 
                   so much.     

02:59.314 --> 03:01.014
         I can't believe        
 that you were available to me. 
                           Yeah.

03:01.049 --> 03:03.950
    And i've had the opportunity
    to work with miley cyrus,   

03:03.985 --> 03:05.518
                Adam levine,    
                and pharrell!   
Miley: Come on.                 

03:05.553 --> 03:06.919
I'm just so excited.            

03:06.955 --> 03:09.255
   Brian: Music has always been 
   an important part of my life 

03:09.291 --> 03:12.925
Since i started traveling across
 the world as a worship leader. 

03:12.961 --> 03:16.696
And so to walk out on that stage
         a pop singer,          

03:16.731 --> 03:18.865
   There's no greater feeling.  

03:18.900 --> 03:21.167
     [ cheers and applause ]    

03:21.202 --> 03:22.468
     I started with pharrell.   

03:22.504 --> 03:25.805
 Both: ¶ need a little sweetness
           in my life ¶         

03:25.840 --> 03:27.573
   ¶ ya sugar ¶                 
                       ¶ sugar ¶

03:27.609 --> 03:29.242
       The winner of this battle
       is abby.                 

03:29.277 --> 03:30.243
         [ cheers and applause ]

03:30.278 --> 03:32.245
               Daly:            
               We got the steal!

03:32.280 --> 03:34.881
    And then for me to be stolen
    is just crazy.              

03:34.916 --> 03:37.016
  There is no reason why        
  you can't take it all the way,

03:37.052 --> 03:38.918
        And i'd love to be there
        by your side to do it.  

03:38.953 --> 03:43.022
The charisma you perform with   
    is infectious.              

03:43.058 --> 03:45.391
You'd be on a pedestal          
     on my team.                

03:45.427 --> 03:46.693
           I pick adam.         

03:46.728 --> 03:50.129
       Adam's had longevity     
        in this industry,       

03:50.165 --> 03:51.731
     And i admire who he is.    

03:51.766 --> 03:55.101
      And so i'm so excited     
        to work with adam.      

03:55.136 --> 03:57.136
   -What song are you gonna do? 
      -I'm doing "grenade."     

03:57.172 --> 03:59.539
       I think the biggest thing
          i admire about bruno  

03:59.574 --> 04:01.240
                Is his ability  
              to be vulnerable. 

04:01.276 --> 04:04.777
   I remember being at an awards
    show before bruno was bruno,

04:04.813 --> 04:06.979
          And he came out       
   and he just, like, killed it.

04:07.015 --> 04:08.915
          And his stage presence
             was so awesome.    

04:08.950 --> 04:09.949
                  Yeah, man.    

04:09.984 --> 04:11.351
               I l-- i love it. 
              I love his energy.

04:11.386 --> 04:12.585
      -He's one of our best.    
              -Yeah.            

04:12.620 --> 04:13.853
   And, you know, it takes chops
          to do his songs.      

04:13.888 --> 04:15.388
          This is a song        
     that i've always loved.    

04:15.423 --> 04:18.190
 ¶ i'd catch a grenade for you ¶

04:18.226 --> 04:19.659
                ¶ yeah, yeah ¶  

04:19.694 --> 04:21.160
   It's perfectly in his range, 

04:21.196 --> 04:23.129
         Because he's got       
        such a great tone.      

04:23.164 --> 04:24.130
  He definitely has star power. 

04:24.165 --> 04:26.833
  ¶ but you won't do the same ¶ 

04:26.868 --> 04:28.034
              -Yeah!            
              -Wow!             

04:28.069 --> 04:30.036
           -Oh, my god.         
  -I had you on the background. 

04:30.071 --> 04:31.771
Whoa, i got that out of the way.

04:31.806 --> 04:33.239
        I knew                  
    you were good.              

04:33.274 --> 04:34.807
              -Ahh.             
             -But...            

04:34.843 --> 04:37.877
       Did i know how good      
         until just now?        

04:37.912 --> 04:38.878
               No.              

04:38.913 --> 04:40.480
       The way                  
that you talked about bruno     

04:40.515 --> 04:42.415
       Is like                  
the way i feel about you,       

04:42.450 --> 04:44.384
   Because you have             
this explosiveness to you.      

04:44.419 --> 04:47.019
I feel like there was times that
you, like, wanted to go there,  

04:47.055 --> 04:49.856
And maybe it's weird to let     
your body do what you would do  

04:49.891 --> 04:51.391
    If these seats              
     were filled,               

04:51.426 --> 04:52.859
    But do it and               
imagine these people are here...

04:52.894 --> 04:54.560
                     Yeah. Yeah.
...So you can really go,        
   like, full-out.              

04:54.596 --> 04:56.863
  And i would say focus         
  on the first half of the song.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.832

16:18.712 --> 16:22.047
        My blind audition       
     was absolutely amazing.    

16:22.083 --> 16:25.284
 You hope for a four-chair turn,
     but you don't expect it.   

16:25.319 --> 16:27.719
         I opened my eyes       
    and was like, "i did it!"   

16:27.755 --> 16:30.956
     You actually sound like    
     you came from that era.    

16:30.991 --> 16:32.291
      I pick blake shelton.     

16:32.326 --> 16:33.292
                    Mary!       

16:33.327 --> 16:38.230
        Working with blake      
        has been so cool.       

16:38.265 --> 16:40.933
     When it comes to giving    
     criticism and critiques,   

16:40.968 --> 16:42.134
   He really knows what to say  

16:42.169 --> 16:44.036
     And how to make my voice   
          sound better.         

16:44.071 --> 16:45.204
        So, loretta lynn.       

16:45.239 --> 16:47.539
     "you ain't woman enough    
        (to take my man)."      

16:47.575 --> 16:50.909
     No matter what, miley is   
  a country girl from tennessee,

16:50.945 --> 16:52.911
              And so            
 she's a perfect mentor for you.

16:52.947 --> 16:54.713
          Me and my mom         
  always used to sing this song,

16:54.748 --> 16:57.182
           Because my dad       
   would always have it playing.

16:57.218 --> 16:58.951
              He actually       
        really inspired me a lot

16:58.986 --> 17:01.420
      Because he always listened
      to female country singers,

17:01.455 --> 17:02.588
So it was empowering.           

17:02.623 --> 17:04.123
               And i felt like  
                i could do it.  

17:04.157 --> 17:05.424
        Yeah.                   

17:05.459 --> 17:06.758
     This song represents me    
           as an artist         

17:06.794 --> 17:08.660
    Because i grew up singing   
  the traditional country music,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.128
       And it's definitely      
      a big part of my life.    

17:10.164 --> 17:12.830
   ¶ he don't love me anymore ¶ 

17:12.867 --> 17:16.201
 ¶ and i'll have to let him go ¶

17:16.237 --> 17:19.070
            ¶ you say           
     you're gonna take him ¶    

17:19.106 --> 17:23.709
 Blake: Mary sarah is a threat  
to every other team on this show

17:23.743 --> 17:27.846
    Because she's so in touch   
   with who she is as an artist 

17:27.882 --> 17:29.314
  And she continues to do things

17:29.350 --> 17:32.251
          That she knows        
        she connects with.      

17:32.286 --> 17:35.687
        ¶ to take my man ¶      

17:35.723 --> 17:36.755
                    Whoo!       

17:36.790 --> 17:39.024
              Such a great song.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.059
          [ chuckles ]          
    you definitely              
have made it your own,          

17:41.095 --> 17:43.328
But it's like if patsy cline    
was covering loretta,           

17:43.364 --> 17:44.696
       Because                  
  it still sounds --            

17:44.732 --> 17:46.698
      -It feels so classic.     
   -I know, such a great vocal. 

17:46.734 --> 17:48.934
 I can't wait to hear           
what miley has to say.          

17:48.969 --> 17:50.302
     When i'm in the studio,    
  i'll just circle little notes.

17:50.337 --> 17:53.805
    I was thinking of -- like,  
   you have such a great range. 

17:53.841 --> 17:55.073
  There was one of the parts... 

17:55.109 --> 17:56.808
        ¶ i'm gonna stand       
           right here ¶         

17:56.844 --> 17:57.943
      You could maybe just,     
              like,             

17:57.978 --> 18:00.412
         Mess with those        
     a few times in the song    

18:00.447 --> 18:02.214
     And let them be, like,     
            a moment.           
                           Okay.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.583
              Yeah.             
To me, i think a lot            
of country music for girls,     

18:04.618 --> 18:06.151
      It ends up                
     going sweet,               

18:06.187 --> 18:08.587
And i think it's cool when you  
have that growl in your voice.  
              Yeah.             

18:08.622 --> 18:10.189
     I think it's good when,    
              like,             

18:10.224 --> 18:13.058
  Especially, like, little girls
   have big, unexpected voices. 

18:13.093 --> 18:14.626
I think you can, like,          
   modern it up.                
                Lean back on it.

18:14.662 --> 18:17.663
                    [ chuckles ]
kn what i've learned            
so far is that gls talk a lot.  

18:17.698 --> 18:18.964
And fast.                       

18:18.999 --> 18:20.432
                     Oh, my god.
        Mary sarah: Yeah.       

18:20.467 --> 18:22.701
  I think mary sarah could be   
  a good thing for country music

18:22.736 --> 18:24.836
Just because                    
she has more of a classic sound,

18:24.872 --> 18:26.538
        But i don't want her    
        to lean on it too much  

18:26.574 --> 18:28.674
And let it not be her own voice.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.809
       I can't believe i'm being
       so, like, okay right now.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.077
         You're so okay.        
[ laughs ]                      

18:32.112 --> 18:33.779
                  Blake shelton 
                and miley cyrus.
        You're more okay.       

18:33.814 --> 18:35.447
        [ laughs ]              

18:35.482 --> 18:37.416
 Do that exact thing            
  at the knockouts.             

18:37.451 --> 18:38.717
                   I shall.     
                 [ chuckles ]   

18:38.752 --> 18:40.786
    It'll be good.              
It'll be good for you.          

18:40.821 --> 18:42.087
     Here we go,                
      brittany.                 

18:42.122 --> 18:43.555
                 What are you   
              gonna sing today? 

18:43.591 --> 18:45.791
I'm singing "you're still       
the one" by shania twain.       

18:45.826 --> 18:46.959
              I love that song. 
Yes.                            

18:46.994 --> 18:48.860
 Not many people do shania songs
          on this show.         

18:48.896 --> 18:49.895
            Brittany:           
           No, i know.          

18:49.930 --> 18:51.330
    I wanted to do              
  a canadian artist.            

18:51.365 --> 18:53.699
            I grew up           
   in montreal, quebec, canada, 

18:53.734 --> 18:54.833
       And i ended up going     

18:54.868 --> 18:57.035
   To berklee college of music  
         for songwriting.       

18:57.071 --> 18:59.504
        After being there,      
 we went to a trip to nashville,

18:59.540 --> 19:01.206
            And i knew          
   that's where i needed to be  

19:01.242 --> 19:02.741
     If i wanted to continue    
            my career.          

19:02.776 --> 19:05.010
            I decided           
   to audition for "the voice"  

19:05.045 --> 19:06.678
  To take it to the next level. 

19:06.714 --> 19:08.513
     ¶ are you strong enough    
         to be my man? ¶        

19:08.549 --> 19:10.849
       The blind auditions      
     were absolutely insane.    

19:10.884 --> 19:11.950
     I like that.               

19:11.986 --> 19:13.218
    Blake turned pretty quick,  

19:13.254 --> 19:14.753
     And then pharrell turned   
       at the last second.      

19:14.788 --> 19:16.888
      I was just blown away.    

19:16.924 --> 19:19.157
          You definitely        
      have a different tone.    

19:19.193 --> 19:20.826
  That was a great performance. 

19:20.861 --> 19:22.561
      Your voice is magical.    

19:22.596 --> 19:25.831
   Kind of sounds like gwen --  
     two girls i really like.   

19:25.866 --> 19:28.333
          I pick blake.         

19:28.369 --> 19:30.302
              Yes!              
     [ cheers and applause ]    

19:30.337 --> 19:31.470
     I love working with blake. 

19:31.505 --> 19:33.205
    Blake: The way              
    that you hold out your notes

19:33.240 --> 19:35.440
  That much longer than         
  anybody else would do is cool.

19:35.476 --> 19:36.742
     I loved it.                

19:36.777 --> 19:38.210
     Brittany:                  
     He has been incredible,    

19:38.245 --> 19:41.713
 And i am so excited that i just
 get to keep learning more.     

19:41.749 --> 19:44.816
    ¶ looks like we made it ¶   

19:44.852 --> 19:47.919
   Musically, i definitely want 
     to have a similar career   

19:47.955 --> 19:49.021
         To shania twain.       

19:49.056 --> 19:50.822
       She really did a lot     
        for country music,      

19:50.858 --> 19:53.091
       And i've just always     
      been inspired by that.    

19:53.127 --> 19:54.726
    ¶ they'll never make it ¶   

19:54.762 --> 19:59.564
      ¶ but just look at us     
           holding on ¶         

19:59.600 --> 20:03.535
If you have ears, you have heard
   this song a million times.   

20:03.570 --> 20:06.571
         And she's really       
      changing it up a lot.     

20:06.607 --> 20:10.075
  On one hand, people are gonna 
        immediately notice      

20:10.110 --> 20:12.744
  When it's not like the record,
      and on the other hand,    

20:12.780 --> 20:14.913
       They may be relieved     
  that it's not like the record.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.983
      It's up to the artist     
    to make people believe it   

20:18.018 --> 20:19.117
       And sell 'em on it.      

20:19.153 --> 20:22.087
Sometimes your vibrato          
    is so dominant              

20:22.122 --> 20:25.290
That it overtakes the actual    
tone and sound of your voice.   

20:25.326 --> 20:27.559
          Clean it up.          
I would definitely figure out   
a way to dial it back,          

20:27.594 --> 20:28.794
Do you think,                   
miley?                          

20:28.829 --> 20:31.229
     I think on the first verse,
          it's a lot of it.     

20:31.265 --> 20:32.698
                On some parts,  
              it's really nice. 

20:32.733 --> 20:34.499
           Okay, cool.          
  Miley: When i made my record, 

20:34.535 --> 20:36.835
  A lot of the notes i would get
     from, like, my producer,   

20:36.870 --> 20:38.804
     He would always be like,   
        "it's distracting       

20:38.839 --> 20:39.971
      To hear your vibrato,     

20:40.007 --> 20:41.873
      Because you can't hear    
       the story anymore."      

20:41.909 --> 20:45.010
       I think if brittany      
    can stay really attentive,  

20:45.045 --> 20:46.244
      She'll do a great job.    

20:46.280 --> 20:47.746
              On the verses,    
          let that be the moment

20:47.781 --> 20:49.181
           Of introducing people
               to the story.    

20:49.216 --> 20:52.050
    This song is already such   
  a kind of lullaby love song...

20:52.086 --> 20:55.053
              Yeah.             
  ...That it then just goes into
                this one melody.

20:55.089 --> 20:56.555
                It never        
                really changes. 

20:56.590 --> 20:58.990
              Okay.             
            And then find places
              you can go there. 

20:59.026 --> 21:00.692
  Because she hits              
  that one big note the one time

21:00.728 --> 21:01.993
              And holds it out  
              so great.         

21:02.029 --> 21:04.329
      I just think you should   
      go there a few more times.

21:04.365 --> 21:05.864
             Right.             
             Let it just like...

21:05.899 --> 21:07.232
             ¶ they said ¶      

21:07.267 --> 21:08.600
             ¶ i'll bet ¶       

21:08.635 --> 21:11.069
             ¶ they'll never    
             make it ¶          

21:11.105 --> 21:14.973
             ¶ but just         
             look at us ¶       

21:15.008 --> 21:17.709
             ¶ holding on ¶     

21:17.745 --> 21:19.344

     when that song started,    

28:02.082 --> 28:04.082
     The girls in here          
     started freaking out.      

28:04.117 --> 28:05.650
Ooh! [ chuckles ]

          after another.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.631
  ¶ haven't i heard from you? ¶ 

28:19.666 --> 28:20.865
               Yes!

28:27.374 --> 28:29.040

  Welcome back to the knockouts.

28:30.177 --> 28:31.576
      You are...

                           Whoo!
    [ laughs ]                  

28:34.614 --> 28:35.580
  We're such dorks.             

28:35.615 --> 28:37.615
    While miley and christina   
            get ready,          

28:37.651 --> 28:40.518
    Let's look at christina's   
      next knockout pairing.    

28:40.554 --> 28:46.024
 Christina: Bryan and trey both 
have natural r&b singing talent.

28:46.059 --> 28:48.359
           There's soul         
      in both of these guys,    

28:48.395 --> 28:50.228
  And there's only room for one.

28:50.263 --> 28:53.164
      Bryan: After season 9     
     and not getting a chair,   

28:53.200 --> 28:55.300
       I knew that i wanted     
          to come back,         

28:55.335 --> 28:56.901
         And i felt like        
    i had something to prove.   

28:56.937 --> 28:58.636
       It was like a dream.     

28:58.672 --> 29:00.171
               No!              
             Bryan:             
    I got two chairs to turn.   

29:00.207 --> 29:01.172
   Just come home.              

29:01.208 --> 29:02.907
             Blake.             
     [ cheers and applause ]    

29:02.943 --> 29:04.409
        Wait, wait, wait.       
Oh!                             

29:04.444 --> 29:05.677
        I pick christina.       

29:05.712 --> 29:07.178
Whoo!                           
 And i just went with my heart. 

29:07.214 --> 29:12.450
 ¶ but it wouldn't be nothing,  
 oh, no-o-o-o ¶                 

29:12.485 --> 29:15.386
Yeah!                           
   The battle, when she called  
  my name, i was just shocked.  

29:15.422 --> 29:17.188
             Bryan.             
             Bryan:             
     I love team christina.     

29:17.224 --> 29:18.823
     I feel like                
     she's an amazing coach,    

29:18.859 --> 29:21.359
    And i don't want the advice 
    that she's giving me to end.

29:21.394 --> 29:22.560
                     Hi!        

29:22.596 --> 29:24.195
Miley's here!                   
               What's going on? 

29:24.231 --> 29:26.531
            You got double girls
            coming at you.      

29:26.566 --> 29:27.699
           It's crazy.          
                         Miley: 
               Nice to meet you.

29:27.734 --> 29:29.000
          How you doing?        

29:29.035 --> 29:30.435
  Bryan: When i see miley cyrus,
       i'm just like, "wow.     

29:30.470 --> 29:31.803
   She has a hell of a voice."  

29:31.838 --> 29:34.072
       And she is soulful.      

29:34.107 --> 29:36.174
          I feel like           
she can make me a better singer.

29:36.209 --> 29:37.342
      What song                 
    are you doing?              

29:37.377 --> 29:39.644
   Today, i'm gonna do "sorry"  
        by justin bieber.       

29:39.679 --> 29:42.013
Ah, so you wanted to, like,     
"pop" it up a little bit.       
              Yeah.             

29:42.048 --> 29:44.849
    I don't want to be known    
       as a soul singer...      
                           Okay.

29:44.885 --> 29:47.252
    ...But a contemporary artist
    that's soulful.             

29:47.287 --> 29:49.387
Is it a different arrangement,  
or the same kind of deal?       

29:49.422 --> 29:50.955
          I love reggae.        

29:50.991 --> 29:52.056
                     Oh!        

29:52.092 --> 29:53.191
       And i'm puerto rican     
         and dominican...       

29:53.226 --> 29:54.792
                       Oh, hey! 
    ...And i love reggaeton.    

29:54.828 --> 29:57.061
    So, it has                  
    that vibe to it.            

29:57.097 --> 29:58.963
                    I want      
                  to hear it!   
  Yeah,                         
let's do it.                    

29:58.999 --> 30:02.200
¶ you got to go and get angry   
at all of my honesty ¶          

30:02.235 --> 30:05.270
Christina: At first, i wasn't   
sure about bryan's choice.      

30:05.305 --> 30:08.439
Sometimes when you do pop songs 
that are very current,          

30:08.475 --> 30:11.809
You know, we tend to have that  
version in our head right away. 

30:11.845 --> 30:14.545
¶ yeah, i kno-o-o-w             
that i let you down ¶           

30:14.581 --> 30:16.114
         ¶ is it too late       
        to say sorry now ¶      

30:16.149 --> 30:18.249
    Christina: But he was into  
      some reggae elements,     

30:18.285 --> 30:21.019
And he actually brought that to 
the table quite well, i thought.

30:21.054 --> 30:23.821
         Just be careful        
   of the very, very beginning. 

30:23.857 --> 30:26.090
                    Okay.       
         Watch the pitch        
       at the first verse,      

30:26.126 --> 30:27.926
    Because i know in your head,
    you're probably, like,      

30:27.961 --> 30:30.128
    Thinking about, like,       
    "oh, i got some tricky stuff

30:30.163 --> 30:32.497
     And some high notes later,"
     but we are judging already.

30:32.532 --> 30:34.999
                      Yeah.     
Sometimes when you're about     
to go into a big note,          

30:35.035 --> 30:36.534
  The line before it            
     will suffer                

30:36.569 --> 30:37.869
Because you're gearing up       
for that next big note,         

30:37.904 --> 30:40.204
     So i think                 
 just work on that.             
                          Okay. 

30:40.240 --> 30:41.839
  But there was nothing about it
  that was too over-the-top.    

30:41.875 --> 30:43.341
        -Yeah, yeah, yeah.      
      -Thank you, thank you.    

30:43.376 --> 30:45.209
At the end, like, he was        
kind of riffing and going there.
              Yeah.             

30:45.245 --> 30:46.711
    It wasn't just              
  trying to be like,            

30:46.746 --> 30:48.079
     "i can riff                
  the entire time."             

30:48.114 --> 30:49.180
              Miley:            
      Sometimes guys come in    

30:49.215 --> 30:50.481
        And they're, like,      
       trying to do it all,     

30:50.517 --> 30:52.383
   But i think you got to save  
       some of the tricks.      

30:52.419 --> 30:53.851
      You've got to have us     
          wanting more.         

30:53.887 --> 30:55.920
          The only thing        
  that i've heard you do before 

30:55.956 --> 30:58.323
That i do like is your falsetto,
      your upper register,      

30:58.358 --> 31:00.224
       If there's a moment      
  to squeeze that in somewhere. 

31:00.260 --> 31:01.626
                    Okay.       

31:01.661 --> 31:04.128
  And i'll leave you with that  
note, so you'll pick your place.

31:04.164 --> 31:05.697
         Because i think        
      as she's saying, too,     

31:05.732 --> 31:06.998
              Like,             
      your choices are good.    

31:07.033 --> 31:09.100
                           Okay.
             Bryan:             
 I feel like i came a long way, 

31:09.135 --> 31:12.570
 And i-i still --               
 i'm not done yet.              

31:12.605 --> 31:14.505
 [ falsetto ] ¶ ye-e-e-ah ¶     

31:14.541 --> 31:16.607
      He's good!                

31:17.944 --> 31:20.144
      ¶ yeah, i kn-o-o-o-w      
      that i let you down ¶     
yeah!                           

31:20.180 --> 31:23.014
¶ is it too late to say sorry? ¶
¶ to say sorry? ¶               

31:23.049 --> 31:25.216
          Christina: That's fun!
That was so good!               

31:25.251 --> 31:27.552
                   Right?       
             His crazy falsetto.
 I was so happy                 
when you did the falsetto.      

31:27.587 --> 31:28.720
            Thank you.          

31:28.755 --> 31:30.521
                            Yes!
     That was                   
 a really good note, girl!      

31:30.557 --> 31:31.522
                     Aww.       
 Yep!                           

31:31.558 --> 31:32.690
                Yay, teamwork!  

31:32.726 --> 31:35.293
    Bryan just has to maintain  
         that confidence        

31:35.328 --> 31:38.129
   And that stylistic approach  
     he brings to the table,    

31:38.164 --> 31:40.198
   Especially when he goes into 
          that falsetto.        

31:40.233 --> 31:41.265
                  Thank you,    
                   ladies.      

31:41.301 --> 31:42.767
        Did you see that?       
       "thank you, ladies."     

31:42.802 --> 31:44.202
                      [ laughs ]
"what's going on, man?"         

31:44.237 --> 31:45.470
                Thank you,      
         and i appreciate y'all.

31:45.505 --> 31:47.205
We appreciate you.              
          [ laughter ]          

31:47.240 --> 31:48.373
          Whoo!                 

31:48.408 --> 31:50.341
        Before the blinds,      
         i was in college       

31:50.377 --> 31:52.977
  At the university of arkansas 
       as a business major.     

31:53.013 --> 31:55.246
           Blake turns.         

31:55.281 --> 31:58.016
 I knew that my life had changed
  the second he hit his button. 

31:58.051 --> 32:00.318
    You were totally on point.  
     Blake's got a good one.    

32:00.353 --> 32:02.086
    Welcome to my team, buddy.  

32:02.122 --> 32:04.722
   Working with blake           
   one-on-one for the battle    
   rounds was really awesome.   

32:04.758 --> 32:06.591
   You're singing so much better
             right now          

32:06.626 --> 32:08.359
               Than you did     
         on the blind auditions.

32:08.395 --> 32:10.028
            And it led          
      to a good performance.    

32:10.063 --> 32:11.129
                ¶ if you don't  
                love me now ¶   

32:11.164 --> 32:13.931
               ¶ you will never 
               love me again ¶  

32:13.967 --> 32:16.968
     Maybe if adam and blake    
  had a baby, it'd be you, trey.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.236
    The winner of this battle   
           is brittany.         

32:18.271 --> 32:20.471
      Trey: In that moment,     
    like, picking brittany...   

32:20.507 --> 32:21.672
     All of a sudden, boom!     

32:21.708 --> 32:22.740
           [ whoosh ]           
                   whoa!        

32:22.776 --> 32:25.209
   Daly:                        
   That is the sound of a steal!

32:25.245 --> 32:26.744
  Trey:                         
  I was super thankful for that.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.113
         I mean, it's christina,
         an amazing vocalist.   

32:29.149 --> 32:30.314
            That was super cool.

32:30.350 --> 32:31.482
             Welcome to my team.

32:31.518 --> 32:33.017
                   Yes,         
          this is the best team.

32:33.053 --> 32:34.485
         So, what kind of artist
            do you want to be?  

32:34.521 --> 32:37.155
I definitely want to go more,   
like, indie-pop side.           

32:37.190 --> 32:38.556
                    Okay.       

32:38.591 --> 32:40.458
    For the knockout, i chose   
    "i lived" by onerepublic.   

32:40.493 --> 32:42.493
    The song is, like, about,   
  you know, life to the fullest.

32:42.529 --> 32:43.895
    And it's defining the moment
     you're living right then.  

32:43.930 --> 32:45.129
          -That's right.        
        -Got to go for it.      

32:45.165 --> 32:46.130
              -Whoo!            
              -Yeah.            

32:46.166 --> 32:47.432
Hanging out with miley          
    and christina,              

32:47.467 --> 32:48.900
       I mean,                  
what more could i ask for?      
                Yeah! [ laughs ]

32:48.935 --> 32:50.535
      The fact that i'm new     
       on christina's team,     

32:50.570 --> 32:52.537
 She's gonna be really keying in
          on, you know,         

32:52.572 --> 32:53.738
   The little things i'm doing. 

32:53.773 --> 32:55.840
       ¶ i swear i lived ¶      

32:55.875 --> 32:56.841
             ¶ ooh ¶            

32:56.876 --> 32:58.342
            Christina:          
    Trey was pretty powerful,   

32:58.378 --> 33:00.878
    And he sang those choruses  
    really nicely, i thought.   

33:00.914 --> 33:02.980
  So i think it makes sense for 
  him to sing this on the show. 

33:03.016 --> 33:04.949
      You're executing your runs
             really well.       

33:04.984 --> 33:06.851
         Actually, i was excited
           about some of those. 

33:06.886 --> 33:08.553
                   Thanks, yeah.
            You know,           
     those trickles down...     

33:08.588 --> 33:09.921
It was cool.                    
       ...Can be intricate      
      and hard to pull off,     

33:09.956 --> 33:11.589
          But it sounded        
           really good.         

33:11.624 --> 33:14.158
     What do you think about    
 the beginning, just delivering?

33:14.194 --> 33:15.660
    When you're free-standing,  
          it's so hard.         

33:15.695 --> 33:17.428
  Especially even sometimes it's
 nice to have a microphone stand

33:17.464 --> 33:19.497
Or something just to make it    
  feel strong still.            

33:19.532 --> 33:20.598
         When the beat kicks in,

33:20.633 --> 33:22.500
           Maybe i could even   
        pull off the mike stand.

33:22.535 --> 33:23.768
   Christina: Yeah.             

33:23.803 --> 33:25.203
It could help you with the      
confidence thing a little bit.  

33:25.238 --> 33:27.171
      I think the mike stand    
           helps a lot          

33:27.207 --> 33:29.373
    Because it really gave him  
    something that was strong,  

33:29.409 --> 33:30.975
      Which that's something    
           that i think         

33:31.010 --> 33:32.944
 He'll have to work on the most,
      like a real presence,     

33:32.979 --> 33:34.378
             And then           
     you get yourself planted   

33:34.414 --> 33:36.481
  And then feeling like you can 
   move around the stage more.  

33:36.516 --> 33:40.418
        ¶ oh, who-o-o-o-a,      
         oh, who-o-o-a ¶        

33:40.453 --> 33:42.553
    Awesome! I-i noticed a boost
   of confidence already, right?

33:42.589 --> 33:44.555
Yeah, totally.                  
          I think the mike stand
             totally helped you.

33:44.591 --> 33:45.890
Seemed totally strong,          
        and...                  

33:45.925 --> 33:48.292
           Your very first line,
              the word "fall."  

33:48.328 --> 33:50.761

33:50.797 --> 33:52.964

33:55.735 --> 33:57.268
Yeah, sometimes when you have   
too much vibrato on the voice --

33:57.303 --> 33:58.269
 I always do it, too.           

33:58.304 --> 34:00.071
      Sometimes                 
 it'll sound pitchy.            

34:00.106 --> 34:01.205
             It's vocal control.

34:01.241 --> 34:03.107

                Making it smooth
                    and steady.

  will be able to take my notes 

34:06.746 --> 34:07.845

38:19.565 --> 38:21.665

    those high notes in there.  

38:21.701 --> 38:22.700

38:22.735 --> 38:24.101

   all of that was really good, 

38:24.137 --> 38:25.503
          And it's funny        
       because i felt like      

38:25.538 --> 38:28.839
  At a certain point in the song
        where it was high,      

38:28.875 --> 38:30.508
       I'm like, "oh, okay,     
 that's the furthest he can go,"

       that is super clean

38:35.415 --> 38:37.481

 that your performance was good.

38:42.455 --> 38:45.055

       one moment where it      
       was kind of pitchy.      

38:45.091 --> 38:48.592
But there were places that were,
 like, technically impressive.  

38:48.628 --> 38:51.328

     give this one to bryan.

           [ applause ]         

38:52.865 --> 38:54.498
                   Thank you.   
                 Appreciate it. 
         Thanks, p. Adam?       

38:54.534 --> 38:56.634
Bryan, you have so many         
more tools in the shed          
than most people.               

38:56.669 --> 38:59.637
Like, i didn't even really know 
      how much.                 

38:59.672 --> 39:02.306
It's crazy. The range you have  
is, like, cr-- insane.          

39:02.341 --> 39:04.041
    I appreciate that so much.  

39:04.076 --> 39:07.344
Trey, i did hear some stuff     
that was pitchy, but then again,

39:07.380 --> 39:10.347
I do believe that a weird part  
of being a singer, too,         

39:10.383 --> 39:13.517
Is, like, being able to manage  
all of the nerves that you feel.

39:13.553 --> 39:15.386
  And, listen, man,             
      you're 20,                

39:15.421 --> 39:17.855
So that's gonna go away         
      and fade.                 

39:17.890 --> 39:20.925
Bryan seems to strike me as     
a bit more seasoned than trey.  

39:20.960 --> 39:22.660
   Moving forward,              
i might lean towards bryan.     

39:22.695 --> 39:23.861
              Daly:             
   All right, thank you, adam.  

39:23.896 --> 39:25.496
     Let's go over to trey's    
       former coach, blake.     

39:25.531 --> 39:27.131
         Bryan had the advantage
              of experience,    

39:27.166 --> 39:29.967
                And also,       
         when that song started,

39:30.002 --> 39:32.203
             The girls in here  
           started freaking out.

39:32.238 --> 39:34.438
          And so you have       
   that little confidence boost.

39:34.474 --> 39:36.974
      And i think as much as    
  i want to throw trey a bone --

39:37.009 --> 39:39.777
  He was on my team before --   
but i think bryan took this one.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.479
        Thank you, blake.       
       Thank you, coaches.      

39:41.514 --> 39:43.113
            Christina,          
    it all comes down to you.   

39:43.149 --> 39:44.648
    Great job to both of you.   

39:44.684 --> 39:47.418
  I know it takes a lot of guts 
         to come up here,       

39:47.453 --> 39:50.187
  And, you know, justin bieber, 
   his vocals and everything -- 

39:50.223 --> 39:52.756
     Like, you have to have     
really good rhythm and accuracy.

39:52.792 --> 39:54.058
      You are so versatile.     

39:54.093 --> 39:55.926
     There's surprises around   
  every corner with your voice. 

39:55.962 --> 39:59.530
         And then, trey,        
    with the onerepublic song,  

39:59.565 --> 40:01.532
         You really knew        
   how to take control of that. 

40:01.567 --> 40:04.735
   I know he has a couple years 
     on you with experience,    

40:04.770 --> 40:05.803
      But you came out here.    

40:05.838 --> 40:07.605
   You got more and more solid, 
             i felt,            

40:07.640 --> 40:09.340
        As you progressed       
         during the song,       

40:09.375 --> 40:10.741
     And i loved the ending.    

40:10.776 --> 40:13.911
   The ending was super clean,  
   super clear, super precise.  

40:13.946 --> 40:16.046
      So, i'm gonna have to     
         make a decision.       

40:16.082 --> 40:17.515
              Uh...             

40:17.550 --> 40:20.951
      I hate saying goodbye     
        to any one of you.

     Bryan, congratulations.    

40:29.629 --> 40:31.495
         You will move on       
       to the live playoffs     

40:31.531 --> 40:33.898
          And represent

40:36.135 --> 40:37.601
              Bryan:            
   I appreciate the compliments 

40:37.637 --> 40:38.802
    That the coaches gave me.   

40:38.838 --> 40:41.171
        I'm still in it,        
and my journey ain't over, so...

40:41.207 --> 40:43.908
     [ laughs ] that's great.   

40:43.943 --> 40:46.877

   and keep working on school.

        You know, i mean,       
   it's a bright future ahead.  

40:53.319 --> 40:54.585
        I believe in that.

how to work it, you know?

    where bryan's gonna take

     is gonna respond to him.

      on bryan.

       and caity together.

  They're two different singers.

41:54.747 --> 41:55.980
       Caity is indie-pop,      

41:56.015 --> 41:58.549
  And abby, she's a pop vocalist
        but super soulful.      

41:58.584 --> 42:01.318
      They both have things     
    that they need to work on

        to the next level.

     that she just does her.

42:23.376 --> 42:25.809
        Never in a million years
        did i ever expect       

42:25.845 --> 42:28.646
          To be standing        
      where i am right now.     

42:28.681 --> 42:31.015
       At the end of 2014,      
          i lost my mom         

42:31.050 --> 42:33.917
       And sort of realized     
  that i need to do what i love 

42:33.953 --> 42:36.120
       Because that's what      
       she wanted me to do.

  That there's nothing like you 
          on this show.

    what it is that you have.

  This is an amazing experience,

42:55.041 --> 42:57.107
    And to not be able          
    to call my mom              

42:57.143 --> 43:00.077
    And talk to her about it    
    is very difficult for me.   

43:00.112 --> 43:02.079
  But i know that she's with me,

43:02.114 --> 43:05.315
   And it's very important to me
   to make her proud.           

43:05.351 --> 43:07.785
    Your voice                  
    is not all about power.     

43:07.820 --> 43:09.153
 There's also, like,            
some really interesting dynamics

43:09.188 --> 43:10.254
           That you do.         

43:10.289 --> 43:12.856
     When you go into, like,    
          a mariah zone.        

43:12.892 --> 43:14.858
          It's something        
  that christina does, as well, 

43:14.894 --> 43:18.062
 And i just don't understand how
  this song lent itself to that.

43:18.097 --> 43:20.330
                   Yeah.        
   Now, i've been proven wrong  
           many times.          

43:20.366 --> 43:22.066
         I mean, this song --   
     i've sang it so many times.

43:22.101 --> 43:23.467
               It holds a place 
                 in my heart.   

43:23.502 --> 43:24.601
              Okay.             
                      I love it.

43:24.637 --> 43:25.803
                           So...
           Well, then,          
        that's important.

         For my knockout,

43:32.378 --> 43:34.411
        My last two songs       
      were mainly pop songs,    

43:34.447 --> 43:38.048
   But i would consider myself  
          pop/jazz/soul.        

43:38.084 --> 43:39.917

                  girl, yeah ¶  
       ¶ no, no, no, no ¶       

43:42.655 --> 43:44.621

   to show the coaches something

43:44.657 --> 43:46.290

  from me.

   man, like, whoa.

      that's as impressive,     

43:52.732 --> 43:53.931
          Especially when chicks
              can go there.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.673

was more, like, toward the end. 

44:02.708 --> 44:04.141
     All the runs               
and all the belting out         

44:04.176 --> 44:06.844
 Is just exhibition,            
exhibition, exhibition.         
                          Right.

44:06.879 --> 44:09.780
And to me,                      
it's a song that's about a vibe.

44:09.815 --> 44:11.048
               Twirlies --      
         that's what i call 'em.

44:11.083 --> 44:12.783
               Twirlie-swirlies 
                 are awesome,   

44:12.818 --> 44:14.184
        But let them be moments 
       rather than a whole part.

44:14.220 --> 44:15.652
             Right.             
Yeah.                           

44:15.688 --> 44:18.155
   Pharrell: In this knockout,  
 i would love for her to do less

44:18.190 --> 44:19.823
   Because when she does more,  

44:19.859 --> 44:21.992
        We only get to see      
          that skill set        

44:22.027 --> 44:23.527
       And not who she is.      

44:23.562 --> 44:26.530
        Can i suggest one moment
          earlier in the song   

44:26.565 --> 44:28.232
               That i think     
         you could go somewhere?

44:28.267 --> 44:30.567
         ¶ don't you kno-o-o-w ¶

44:30.603 --> 44:32.703
   ¶ don't you kno-o-o-o-o-o-w ¶

44:32.738 --> 44:35.139
                Stay on that.   
             ¶ kno-o-o-o-o-o-w ¶

44:35.174 --> 44:36.473
  ¶ don't you kno-o-o-o-o-o-w ¶ 
              okay.             

44:36.509 --> 44:38.342
        'cause then you can get,
         like, a punch quicker  

44:38.377 --> 44:39.543
                 But without    
             having to feel like

44:39.578 --> 44:41.078
                    The end     
       is just constantly going.
              Okay.

              Do you like that? 

44:47.787 --> 44:49.286
Wow.                            
       ¶ that it's wrong ¶      

44:49.321 --> 44:51.355
You wouldn't go roundabout a way
     of saying something --     

44:51.390 --> 44:52.923
   Well, at least i wouldn't -- 
          in real life.         

44:52.958 --> 44:55.425

                   ¶ go-o-o-ne ¶

44:55.461 --> 44:59.329
  So don't be so frolicky around
  what you're trying to say.

       ¶ you can get along      
       if you try to be strong ¶

45:01.734 --> 45:02.833

              be stro-o-o-ng ¶  

45:02.868 --> 45:04.635
     Abby: I wanted to show them
     what i could do,           

45:04.670 --> 45:07.437
  But i think their feedback was
  exactly what i needed to hear.

45:07.473 --> 45:08.772
That doesn't feel like          
      too much.                 

45:08.808 --> 45:09.973
              It doesn't at all.
It's just, like, highlighting   

45:10.009 --> 45:11.341
What's already there            
    in the song.                
                           Yeah.

45:11.377 --> 45:12.810
              Yeah,             
   find a happy medium of both. 

45:12.845 --> 45:13.811
                     Yeah.      
 Yeah.                          

45:13.846 --> 45:15.245
 Okay.                          

45:15.281 --> 45:16.880
 I just really need to trust    
 in my voice that it's enough   

45:16.916 --> 45:18.515
 And that i don't need to add   
 all that extra stuff.          

45:18.551 --> 45:20.918
My next album is gonna be called
       "swirlie-twirlie."       

45:20.953 --> 45:22.519
      [ laughs ]                
 the swirlie-twirlie.           

45:22.555 --> 45:23.821
            The swirlie-twirlie.

45:23.856 --> 45:26.256
              Caity:            
 My dad and brother are lawyers,

45:26.292 --> 45:27.758
         And my sister's        
      in the nursing field.     

45:27.793 --> 45:31.728
  But they have done nothing but
  support me to go off the path.

45:31.764 --> 45:34.231
   ¶ it's hard for me to say ¶  

45:34.266 --> 45:37.034
  ¶ but i'm jealous of the way ¶

45:37.069 --> 45:39.236
          At the blinds,        
     all four chairs turned,    

45:39.271 --> 45:40.838
   And it was so overwhelming.  

45:40.873 --> 45:43.240
  This is the kind of intensity 
     that the show is about.    

45:43.275 --> 45:45.943
   I would love the opportunity 
   to be in business with you.  

45:45.978 --> 45:47.110
         I pick pharrell.       

45:47.146 --> 45:48.212
     [ cheers and applause ]    

45:48.247 --> 45:49.313
     Pharrell is so genuine.    

45:49.348 --> 45:50.714
        He's encouraging.       

45:50.749 --> 45:52.449
     You got, like, a little -- 
   a stevie nicks kind of thing.

45:52.484 --> 45:54.284
Thank you.                      
   Every day, it's been, like,  

45:54.320 --> 45:56.887
           Figuring out         
      who i am as an artist,    

45:56.922 --> 46:00.657
And so to be able to continue on
would just be a dream come true.

46:00.693 --> 46:02.626
                So, talk to me  
               about the song.  

46:02.661 --> 46:04.494
    It's "leave your lover,"    
           sam smith.           
                           Yeah.

46:04.530 --> 46:06.196
         I just remember        
       going through a time     

46:06.232 --> 46:08.031
      Where this song, like,    
         really hit home,       

46:08.067 --> 46:09.867
        And i didn't know       
     how to put it to words.    

46:09.902 --> 46:12.169
          And this song         
         did that for me.       

46:12.204 --> 46:13.804
                        Awesome.
And it challenges me            
      vocally                   

46:13.839 --> 46:15.072
       Because                  
i'm not usually comfortable     

46:15.107 --> 46:16.440
           In the highs         
        and love the lows.      

46:16.475 --> 46:18.208
  -That's nice to hear, though. 
              -Yeah.            

46:18.244 --> 46:19.376
           You know i like that.

46:19.411 --> 46:20.878
          -Yeah, i know.        
           -[ laughs ]          

46:20.913 --> 46:22.346
              I love            
      singing soulful music,    

46:22.381 --> 46:24.314
       And i try to show        
a piece of who i am when i sing.

46:29.221 --> 46:30.721
     Pharrell: Caity's really   
      connected to the song.    

46:30.756 --> 46:32.189
   This is a very good example  

46:32.224 --> 46:34.992
      Of the direction that     
  one would expect her to go to.

46:35.027 --> 46:36.960
               -Oh.             
     -That's a radical song.    

46:36.996 --> 46:38.161
                   Miley:       
           What are you feeling?

46:38.197 --> 46:40.464
         -What was this?        
   -I cracked at that one note. 

46:40.499 --> 46:41.531
 Pharrell: It's okay.           

46:41.567 --> 46:43.066
         -It was honest.        
           -Okay. Yeah.         

46:43.102 --> 46:44.434
  That's beautiful.             

46:44.470 --> 46:46.670
To me, that was, like, your best
performance on the whole show.  

46:46.705 --> 46:48.472
             Really?            
                    Only thing  
                 i was gonna say

46:48.507 --> 46:51.174
           Was maybe just trying
            some melody things. 

46:51.210 --> 46:55.913
Like... ¶ if i can't have you,  
i want this life alone ¶        

46:55.948 --> 47:00.817
¶ spare you the rising storm    
and let the rivers flo-o-o-w ¶  
                         okay.  

47:00.853 --> 47:02.152
       I love miley cyrus.      

47:02.187 --> 47:04.254
 She was kind of my first person

47:04.290 --> 47:07.557
      That made me feel okay    
    about having a low voice,   

47:07.593 --> 47:10.827
And so it was really cool for me
 to hear her lows and her highs 

47:10.863 --> 47:12.829
         And how she just       
        makes it all work.      

47:12.865 --> 47:14.097
      How do you sing this?

 ¶ and watch you call her name ¶

   [strongly] ¶ call her name ¶ 

47:18.604 --> 47:20.604
   Just, like,                  
keeping those notes up there.   
                           Okay.

47:20.639 --> 47:22.105
                  Keeping it up,
                        yeah.   
Because it just makes it        
a little bit more epic,         

47:22.141 --> 47:23.640
Because it's such a nice,       
     soft song.                 
                         Mm-hmm.

47:23.676 --> 47:25.976
As much as you want to take it  
 and make it yours.

And i think lifting some        
of those lines that she sang    

47:29.982 --> 47:31.782
Takes you all the way           
     to the top.                
                           Yeah.

47:31.817 --> 47:33.250
         Caity -- i think       
  i threw a lot of notes at her.

     But it was really about    

47:39.191 --> 47:40.891
             Not just           
    relying on the low notes,   

47:40.926 --> 47:42.459
    Because then you don't get  
      enough of this, like,     

47:42.494 --> 47:45.128
          "wow, she just        
      totally killed that."

 i'm doing this song            

01:00:41.773 --> 01:00:44.107
Because i want to show a        
different side of myself        
that's more singer-y,"          

01:00:44.142 --> 01:00:46.843
     But give me                
the grittiness of your voice.   

01:00:46.878 --> 01:00:48.377
     I think that               
you should be singing this song 

01:00:48.413 --> 01:00:51.247
 In the original key            
because i think you <i> can</i> do that.

01:00:51.282 --> 01:00:53.249
You're an awesome guitar player,
        awesome singer.         

01:00:53.284 --> 01:00:54.851
   I think it will just give you
        more of a challenge.    

01:00:54.886 --> 01:00:56.853
 Yeah, peter gabriel            
is struggling through it,       

01:00:56.888 --> 01:00:59.355
In a way, because he's --       
he's pushing so hard.           

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.457
The emotion of what he's singing
    is coming out.              

01:01:01.493 --> 01:01:03.793
And the key you're singing it in
   is so effortless             

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:06.829
That i don't feel enough        
of what i need to feel.         
              Okay.             

01:01:06.865 --> 01:01:08.464
     I was just more nervous    
      because i'm straining     

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.533
  On the -- on the higher stuff 
       a little bit more.       
Strain.                         

01:01:10.568 --> 01:01:11.701
   When you strain,             
  it sounds amazing.            

01:01:11.736 --> 01:01:13.035
                There's times   
              where i'm onstage 

01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:14.604
       And, like, i have no idea
       how i just hit that note,

01:01:14.639 --> 01:01:15.805
        But the adrenaline goes.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.141
And once these seats are filled,
        it'll be easier.        

01:01:18.176 --> 01:01:19.609
              Okay.             

01:01:19.644 --> 01:01:21.844
  Adam: Laith, this is a step in
  a different direction for him.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:23.479
   But he's gonna kind of pull  
    the dirt out of this song   

01:01:23.515 --> 01:01:26.182
  And really connect and dig in.

01:01:26.217 --> 01:01:29.285
Peter gabriel's delivery        
of those first few lines,       

01:01:30.922 --> 01:01:33.389
       ¶ love,                  
   i get so lost ¶              

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:35.691
      Like, ugh.                
It's just so perfect, you know? 

01:01:35.727 --> 01:01:38.327
Those are important to hit      
    on his beats.               

01:01:38.363 --> 01:01:39.362
              Okay.             

01:01:39.397 --> 01:01:40.763
        Working with adam       
       has been tremendous,     

01:01:40.799 --> 01:01:42.732
            And i love          
   that he's trying to push me  

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:43.833
  To get out of my comfort zone.

01:01:43.868 --> 01:01:45.735
        ¶ i get so lost ¶       

01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.069
          ¶ sometimes ¶         

01:01:47.105 --> 01:01:50.039
   The song in the original key 
     was a great adjustment.    

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:53.910
              ¶ oh,             
   i want to be that complete ¶ 

01:01:53.945 --> 01:01:58.481
    And i think he's just got   
  an epic kind of classic voice.

01:01:58.516 --> 01:01:59.949
         ¶ in your eyes ¶       

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:02.285
                    Yeah!       

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.253
               It just was,     
          like, a different song

01:02:04.289 --> 01:02:06.556
               With you singing 
                  like that.    
It's night and day.             

01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:07.590
             Awesome.           

01:02:07.625 --> 01:02:08.925
   I don't want you             
  ever to be singing            

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.827
In a way that doesn't reflect   
     who you are.               

01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:12.862
This time, it was               
like, "oh, there's laith.       
I found him again."             

01:02:12.897 --> 01:02:15.665
If you're gonna do this song,   
   do it like you.              

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.200
  In order to win this knockout,

01:02:17.235 --> 01:02:19.602
     I'm gonna give it my all   
      and my whole heart...     

01:02:19.637 --> 01:02:22.038
           Thanks so much, man. 
    We got it --                
we got it together.             

01:02:22.073 --> 01:02:26.075
...And put as much of myself    
into it that i can.             

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:30.046
Now with "in your eyes,"        
here's laith al-saadi.          

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:32.014
[ cheers and applause ]         

01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:34.317
                      ¶         

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:39.989
             ¶ love ¶           

01:02:41.559 --> 01:02:43.993
        ¶ i get so lost ¶

          ¶ days pass ¶         

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:57.874
       ¶ and this emptiness     
         fills my heart ¶       

01:02:59.377 --> 01:03:03.312
   ¶ when i want to run away ¶  

01:03:03.348 --> 01:03:07.316
    ¶ i drive off in my car ¶   

01:03:10.088 --> 01:03:13.823
    ¶ but whichever way i go ¶  

01:03:13.858 --> 01:03:18.294
          ¶ i come back         
      to the place you are ¶    

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.666
     ¶ and all my instincts ¶   

01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:26.202
         ¶ they return ¶

     ¶ and the grand facade ¶   

01:03:28.439 --> 01:03:31.741
      ¶ so soon will burn ¶     

01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:34.377
       ¶ without a noise ¶      

01:03:34.412 --> 01:03:36.913
       ¶ without my pride ¶     

01:03:36.948 --> 01:03:40.216
 ¶ i reach out from the inside ¶

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:41.350
             ¶ ohh ¶            

01:03:41.386 --> 01:03:45.121
      ¶ ohh, in your eyes ¶     

01:03:45.156 --> 01:03:46.589

¶ of all my fruitless searches ¶

   i want to be that complete ¶

         We got a steal!        

01:04:34.906 --> 01:04:36.839
       ...The final steal.      

01:04:42.346 --> 01:04:43.579
     ¶ this is "the voice" ¶    

01:04:43.614 --> 01:04:45.314
              Daly:             
  Welcome back to the knockouts.

01:04:45.350 --> 01:04:49.051
      Singing "wake me up,"     
     here's jessica crosbie.

01:04:54.359 --> 01:04:58.327
    Jessica: ¶ feeling my way   
      through the darkness ¶    

01:04:58.363 --> 01:05:02.431
  ¶ guided by a beating heart ¶ 

01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:07.003
          ¶ i can't tell        
   where the journey will end ¶ 

01:05:07.038 --> 01:05:10.139
  ¶ but i know where it starts ¶

   Daly: Give it up for jessica 
      and laith, everybody,     

01:06:13.337 --> 01:06:15.671
 In this knockout for team adam.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:17.973
  All right, let's hear what the
 coaches have to say about that.

01:06:18.009 --> 01:06:19.442
              Blake,            
      let's start with you.     

01:06:19.477 --> 01:06:21.544
           Jessica, i thought   
        you sang it pretty good,

01:06:21.579 --> 01:06:24.447
           And with laith,      
     your vocals are incredible.

01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:26.482
                  I mean,       
           you steamrolled that.

01:06:26.517 --> 01:06:29.118
              And so i give this
                  to laith.     

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:31.654
          I hope that helps you,
              little buddy.     

01:06:31.689 --> 01:06:33.489
        Thank you, blake.       
   Pharrell, what'd you think?  

01:06:33.524 --> 01:06:36.225
     Pharrell: Laith, i think   
 you did display a lot of range,

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:38.828
  But emotionally, we didn't get
      to the soaring heights    

01:06:38.863 --> 01:06:40.229
   That we're used to with you. 

01:06:40.264 --> 01:06:43.599
        You gave the song       
  somewhere between 75% and 85%.

01:06:43.634 --> 01:06:46.001
         85% is awesome,        
     but this is "the voice"    

01:06:46.037 --> 01:06:48.404
      And people are, like,     
        competitive here.       

01:06:48.439 --> 01:06:51.307
        And then, jessica,      
 obviously, you were on my team.

01:06:51.342 --> 01:06:54.944
You have a beautiful voice, and 
i think you did show more range,

01:06:54.979 --> 01:06:58.247
    And that is the reason why  
 i personally would go with you.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:06:59.782
           Daly: Cool.          
       Thank you, pharrell.     

01:06:59.817 --> 01:07:00.816
            Christina?          

01:07:00.852 --> 01:07:03.219
          You both gave         
       solid performances.      

01:07:03.254 --> 01:07:05.554
    I thought you were pretty   
   consistent in your delivery. 

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:07.556
         And yeah, laith,       
  you're a super-strong singer. 

01:07:07.592 --> 01:07:10.226

                   on my notes. 
       Start                    
as a sexy panther,              

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.533
And then at the end,            
you're a lion, right?           

01:12:17.568 --> 01:12:18.767
                    Okay,       
                 let's do it.   

01:12:18.803 --> 01:12:20.469
              Joe is            
      the kind of performer     

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.571
      That feeds off passion    
           and emotion.

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:38.921

             on there, like...  
              Okay.

01:12:44.662 --> 01:12:45.627
        All right, ladies.      

01:12:45.663 --> 01:12:48.197
              Kata:             
       Before "the voice,"      

01:12:48.232 --> 01:12:51.166
  I was working in a karaoke bar
      in nashville for tips,    

01:12:51.202 --> 01:12:53.235
     Trying to be a musician.

        so we can get to work?  

01:13:03.948 --> 01:13:08.217

 the greatest singers ever born.

01:13:12.089 --> 01:13:14.089
     The best adrenaline rush   
          i've ever had.        

01:13:14.124 --> 01:13:15.424
       The winner is kata.      

01:13:15.459 --> 01:13:18.026
      I feel like christina     
    believes in me so deeply.   

01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:21.630
       I'm looking forward      
  to just working with her more.

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:30.372
      I chose "why haven't i    
     heard from you" by reba,   

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:33.275
   Who is my fellow oklahoman,  
        my fellow redhead.      

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:36.745
         ¶ why haven't i        
        heard from you? ¶       

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.314
       It's a country song,     
     but it's equally, like,    

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.950
        A rock/blues song,      
   which is what i want to do.  

01:13:41.986 --> 01:13:44.653
           ¶ you, ohh ¶         

01:13:44.688 --> 01:13:46.455
  I love kata singing this song.

01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:48.957
          She taps into         
       this country element     

01:13:48.993 --> 01:13:51.159
       That is so powerful      

01:13:51.195 --> 01:13:53.428
Because it just sounds and feels
          so genuine.           

01:13:53.464 --> 01:13:58.166
         ¶ why haven't i        
        heard from you? ¶       

01:13:58.202 --> 01:13:59.568
                  I love it!    

01:13:59.603 --> 01:14:01.403
        My dad

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:03.205
It's, like, what he made me     
listen to on the jukebox

Yeah.                           
      You're bringing her back. 

01:14:06.243 --> 01:14:07.709

01:14:07.745 --> 01:14:09.611

01:14:09.647 --> 01:14:11.046

     your version               

01:14:12.616 --> 01:14:14.216
Because it had more of,

01:14:14.251 --> 01:14:15.484
       You just bring fire.     

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:17.419
You had something that really   
made me want to watch you.      

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:18.554
   And i feel like              
    you're someone              

01:14:18.589 --> 01:14:21.423
That would be super useful      
  to country music.

i sing too much with an accent, 

01:14:31.101 --> 01:14:33.168
My mom was always like,         
"put your teeth back in!"

         it didn't go too much. 

01:14:40.544 --> 01:14:42.411
     I love having her here.    
     I mean, it's perfect --

she brings in a great expertise.

  like, turbo boost             

01:19:43.213 --> 01:19:46.548
In the middle of the performance
right when the song modulated,  

01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:50.151
You took it from one level      
 to the extreme next,           

01:19:50.187 --> 01:19:52.854
Which i think is a true         
testament to your talent.

But i also cannot front on you, 
        kata,                   

01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:58.026
Because the minute that         
you stopped playing the guitar, 

01:19:58.061 --> 01:20:00.462
     That's when                
you kind of lit up, too.        

01:20:00.497 --> 01:20:03.632
You were definitely fighting.   
Great job to both of you guys.  

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:05.967

What people are made of         
and what they've got.           

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:13.708
And the big surprise for me     
       is kata.                 

01:20:13.744 --> 01:20:16.578

definitely seen you kill it.

we've seen you do well,         

01:20:18.582 --> 01:20:20.582

i think that we saw you, like,

Absolutely just destroy it.     

01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:24.286
So i'm going                    
with kata.

01:20:27.891 --> 01:20:30.492

           just fills the room, 

01:20:30.527 --> 01:20:31.826

01:20:31.862 --> 01:20:34.029
               Joe,             
  you were the revelation for me

01:20:34.064 --> 01:20:36.264
      Because towards the middle
          of the song, man,     

01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:39.100
         You turned it up       
 and you were down on your knees

      And filling this room with
      not only your great voice,

01:20:42.539 --> 01:20:44.272

  for sure, the way they fought.
Yeah.                           

01:20:47.444 --> 01:20:48.410
So i don't know                 
what you're gonna do.           

01:20:48.445 --> 01:20:49.477

      do bring to the table     

01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:54.983
         Is showmanship.        

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:58.687
  You guys both know how to dig 
  into your gut of your feeling 

01:20:58.722 --> 01:21:02.023
    And your emotion and just   
    make the room come alive.   

01:21:02.059 --> 01:21:03.458
        Joe, the beginning      

01:21:03.493 --> 01:21:05.894
   Is something to be worked on 
        a little bit more,      

01:21:05.929 --> 01:21:07.762
    But definitely by the end,  

01:21:07.798 --> 01:21:12.567
    The way that you made that  
    your own was electrifying.  

01:21:12.602 --> 01:21:14.970
           And i loved          
      every second of that.

01:23:36.746 --> 01:23:38.012
                     Ahh!       

01:23:38.048 --> 01:23:39.447
Got to get a plan together      
and win this thing now.         
                            Yes!

01:23:39.483 --> 01:23:40.515
    All right.                  
                      [ laughs ]

01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:41.950
Congratulations, man!           
                      Thank you!

01:23:41.985 --> 01:23:44.052
       She was a fireball,      
             though.            

01:23:44.087 --> 01:23:45.753
                           Yeah.
 She surprised me.              

01:23:45.789 --> 01:23:46.821
               She's fun fire.  

01:23:46.857 --> 01:23:48.323
     [ cheers and applause ]    

01:23:48.358 --> 01:23:51.659
 Blake: The team that i'm taking
      into the live playoffs    

01:23:51.695 --> 01:23:54.262
      Is country, rock, pop,    
            r&b, soul.          

01:23:54.297 --> 01:23:55.396
It's a little bit of everything.

01:23:55.432 --> 01:23:58.066
             My team            
 is definitely the team to beat,

01:23:58.101 --> 01:24:01.069
    But the other team to beat  
        is team christina.      

01:24:01.104 --> 01:24:04.439
    Christina: Team christina   
    is kicking butt this year.  

01:24:04.474 --> 01:24:08.109
    I think there's definitely  
  some -- some stars on my team.

01:24:08.145 --> 01:24:11.579
  Going into the live playoffs, 
           i am pumped.         

01:24:11.615 --> 01:24:14.015
