37:37.080 --> 37:41.302
I am hosting
a press conference tomorrow.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.696
To announce that I'm a Hudson.

37:43.739 --> 37:46.438
And to take over
Hudson Enterprises

37:46.481 --> 37:48.831
as its rightful heir,
now that Ryan has been

37:48.875 --> 37:50.137
frozen out of the succession.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.618
But I am only doing that

37:52.661 --> 37:56.317

the company's assets.

37:56.361 --> 38:00.016

what about him?

38:06.675 --> 38:08.764
Well, I did a little digging
and there's

38:08.808 --> 38:10.505
something that you could sign,

38:10.549 --> 38:13.987
Ryan, called a "consent
of parent to adoption..."

38:14.030 --> 38:16.032
