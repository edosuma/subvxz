What's your emergency?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.806
-Help me get her some air.
-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

00:21.789 --> 00:25.159
ABBY:
What's your emergency?

00:25.193 --> 00:27.428
The first kind of emergency
is the one

00:27.461 --> 00:30.431
we all have, every day.

00:30.464 --> 00:32.833
You're looking at my emergency
right now.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.103
I'm 42 years old.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.105
It's been a year
since my boyfriend Tommy

00:37.138 --> 00:38.372
broke up with me.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.907
I'm still not over it.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.912
My mom's a big part
of my emergency.

00:44.945 --> 00:48.382
Alzheimer's disease,
late-stage.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.784
Mom, I'm going to work.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.254
Veronica's in the kitchen.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.557
Taking care of her pretty much
takes up all my free time.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.725
There's my number, right there,

00:57.758 --> 00:59.727
in case you need to call me
for anything.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.862
You don't have to tell me
every time.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.464
-Sometimes you forget.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.366
And then you forget you forget.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.935
-No, you're not.

01:07.968 --> 01:10.904
Careful, careful.
You got it. Good, good.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.744
Ah.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.380
-I'm healed.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.649
You look good today.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.285
-Mm.
-Have a good day.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.287
-Drive carefully.
-I will.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.257
-Ooh, you smell good.
-Woo-hoo!

01:29.290 --> 01:31.159
ABBY: Then there's
the second kind of emergency,

01:31.192 --> 01:33.161
the kind
you never want to have,

01:33.194 --> 01:34.762
the kind that comes
without warning--

01:34.795 --> 01:38.932
the car crash, the fire,
the heart attack, the break-in.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.168
That's the kind
you call me about.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.069
I'm the actual first responder.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.305
-WOMAN: My son.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.907
He hit his head on the diving
board, and he's not breathing.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.242
ABBY:
What's your address, ma'am?

01:48.276 --> 01:50.511
Uh, 242 Beatrice Lane.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.780
I'm in Beverly Hills.
Please hurry!

01:52.813 --> 01:54.515
-Okay, paramedics are
on the way. -Oh, my God.

01:54.548 --> 01:57.485
-He's turning blue! -I need you
to perform CPR on him.

01:57.518 --> 01:58.586
Do you remember what to do?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.921
30 chest compressions
followed by two breaths.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.657
-Okay. -30 and two.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.862
Okay, Buck,
start chest compressions.

02:08.896 --> 02:09.997
Hen, start bagging him.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.699
HEN:
Got you, Captain.

02:11.732 --> 02:15.102
Ma'am, come with me.
I need to get my team in there.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.470
Don't worry.
He's gonna be all right.

02:16.504 --> 02:17.671
He's gonna be all right.
Please, just take a seat.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.139
HEN:
Get some of that water out.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.708
BUCK: Coming around.
Starting compressions.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.942
CHIMNEY:
Pulse ox is on. Pad's on.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.711
-I don't know.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.479
-A few minutes, maybe.
-...seven, eight, nine, ten,

02:25.513 --> 02:28.316
-11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17...
-No.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.484
...18, 19, 20. Go.

02:31.552 --> 02:32.986
-No rhythm.

02:34.722 --> 02:36.657
:
Come on. Come on.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.793
ABBY: The crazy part is
that as soon as help arrives...

02:41.262 --> 02:43.197
...most people just hang up.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.165
HEN: It's coming,
it's coming, it's coming.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.835
-BUCK: Hey. Hey,
man. That's it. Get it out.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.870
-BOBBY: Good job, kid.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.705
-Good job. Good job. -All right,
kid, your mom is right here.

02:51.739 --> 02:52.706
-Whew.
-You're gonna be okay.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.141
Thank you.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.543
:
You'll be okay.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.579
ABBY:
I guess it's for the best

02:58.612 --> 03:02.082
that I usually don't know
how it all ends.

03:02.115 --> 03:05.586
The fireman is trying
to talk her down.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.087
This is so messed up.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.422
ABBY:
Are you friends with her?

03:08.456 --> 03:10.391
Can you talk to her?

03:10.424 --> 03:11.992
Well, we just get high together.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.195
Everybody who's ever tried
something like this and survived

03:15.229 --> 03:17.598
says the same thing:

03:17.631 --> 03:21.201
the second they step off
that ledge, they regretted it.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.070
I've been where you are.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.505
I know how you feel.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.039
Believe me.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.676
There's hope.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.444
Okay?

03:30.478 --> 03:32.280
Let me buy you
a cup of coffee.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.747
I'll tell you all about it.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.783
I can help you.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.691
Please. Please.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.226
No one can help me.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.063
-JUNKIE: No, no, no,

03:50.097 --> 03:51.599
no, no, no!

03:51.632 --> 03:54.134
She jumped. She jumped.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.907
ABBY: Is it weird that I feel
more comfortable dealing

03:59.940 --> 04:02.142
with these kinds of emergencies
than the one I have

04:02.175 --> 04:05.212
to deal with
when I leave work and go home?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.914
I don't know.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.485
911. What's your emergency?

04:11.519 --> 04:13.153
WOMAN:
Yeah, I'm in the drive-through,

04:13.186 --> 04:15.255
and they only gave me
six nuggets in my nine-piece,

04:15.289 --> 04:18.258
and this bitch manager
won't give me my extra nugs.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.828
Ma'am, it's against the law to
call 911 with a non-emergency.

04:20.861 --> 04:22.496
Eat your nuggets,
get some perspective,

04:22.530 --> 04:24.332
and get the hell off my line.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.335
*

04:55.663 --> 04:57.130
-In the name of
the Father, the Son,

04:57.164 --> 04:58.766
-and the Holy Ghost.
-...Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.000
My last confession...

05:00.033 --> 05:03.637
:
* Baby, you're a firework

05:03.671 --> 05:06.206
* Come on, show 'em
what you're... *

05:08.041 --> 05:11.244
I'm so, so sorry. Um...

05:14.214 --> 05:16.183
-I'm new.
-Mm.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.651
-But you're familiar

05:17.685 --> 05:19.387
with the basics
of how this all works?

05:19.420 --> 05:22.189
I am fully authorized
to absolve any venial sins

05:22.222 --> 05:23.624
and assign penance.

05:23.657 --> 05:27.060
What if I have to confess
a mortal sin?

05:27.094 --> 05:30.130
I'm kidding. Do you want
to do this out on the pews?

05:30.163 --> 05:33.233
Oh. Yes. Please.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.836
My last confession
was a week ago.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.571
I was an alcoholic.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.674
Did some drugs, too,
near the end-- painkillers.

05:40.708 --> 05:43.511
Lost a decade of my life,
in and out of rehab.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.580
Put on forced leave
by the fire department.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.416
But I got myself back together,

05:48.449 --> 05:51.318
and I've been back on the job
for 18 months.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.654
Your last confession
was a week ago.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.656
Weren't you already absolved?

05:55.689 --> 05:58.726
It helps me to confess it all
once a week,

05:58.759 --> 06:01.061
to remind myself how easy it is

06:01.094 --> 06:04.598
for me to end up
on the wrong path.

06:04.632 --> 06:08.368
But this week, I lost one.
A woman.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.270
A jumper.

06:10.303 --> 06:14.041
PRIEST: It must be hard
being a first responder.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.444
The only way to survive the job
is to find a way

06:16.477 --> 06:18.345
to cope with the ones you lose.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.113
This is why you drank?

06:20.147 --> 06:22.349
Like I said,
we all find ways to cope.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.786
Some drink, some do drugs,
some gamble.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.888
Some are sex addicts.

06:29.457 --> 06:32.192
-* We sit around

06:32.225 --> 06:34.361
* Our money's spent

06:34.394 --> 06:38.298
* Why can't you all get down?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.536
* Drive ancient cars

06:42.570 --> 06:45.739
-* Can't pay the rent

06:45.773 --> 06:48.609
* Why can't you all get down?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.716
* Drink the water,
it's a drought *

06:55.749 --> 07:00.921
* How are you this scared?
This scared? *

07:02.656 --> 07:04.792
Groovyheels297?

07:06.026 --> 07:08.095
-This is cheating.
-No, no, no.

07:08.128 --> 07:12.365
You said if I got to you in five
minutes, you would be all mine.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.237
Is this why they call you
Firehose?

07:17.270 --> 07:20.007
No.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.742
* Bad reputation

07:21.775 --> 07:23.744
* Bad reputation.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.687
Someone punch you in the face?

07:33.721 --> 07:37.424
What? Nah, it's a...
it's a birthmark.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.459
I dig it.

07:39.493 --> 07:41.194
-Hey, can I, uh...

07:41.228 --> 07:43.797
...can I get your actual number?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.799
You're cute.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.802
And... you're very good
at whatever it is we just did.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.438
-Let's not ruin everything

07:51.471 --> 07:53.741
by actually getting to know
each other.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.484
Damn.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.621
We're living in a golden age.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.358
POWELL :
Merry Christmas.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.729
Police, there's automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

08:15.763 --> 08:18.465
-I need backup assistance now!

08:25.438 --> 08:28.041
McCLANE :
Welcome to the party, pal!

08:28.075 --> 08:29.677
CHIMNEY:
I know exactly what

08:29.710 --> 08:32.746
that polite, distant smile
means: she's bored.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.047
One foot out the door.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.516
This woman's so far
out of my league,

08:36.550 --> 08:37.685
but she's just
once-in-a-lifetime.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.052
I can't let her go.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.721
Lots of fish in the sea.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.522
Not with the bait he's using.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.224
Cruel but true. Mm.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.827
-I met her
on this new dating site

08:46.860 --> 08:51.031
just for cops and firefighters,
RomancingTheUniform.com.

08:51.064 --> 08:54.034
She's an adrenaline junkie,
so foreplay is me telling her

08:54.067 --> 08:55.769
stories about running
into burning buildings

08:55.803 --> 08:57.537
and jumping into
icy lakes and...

08:57.571 --> 08:59.907
I'm sorry, wait.
Remind me, when is the last time

08:59.940 --> 09:02.710
you ran into
or jumped over anything?

09:02.743 --> 09:05.545
-I embellish a little.
-Oh. Noted.

09:05.579 --> 09:09.216
I'm telling you, the uniform
is a major aphrodisiac.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.484
-Clearly.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.803
Oh, damn.

09:41.615 --> 09:42.983
-Whew.
-Hey!

09:43.016 --> 09:44.584
-I just... -Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wash your hands.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.953
We don't know
where they've been.

09:45.986 --> 09:48.588
-I was in the neighborhood.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.724
I was just, uh,
getting it washed.

09:50.758 --> 09:52.325
They charge you extra
for the full detail?

09:52.359 --> 09:53.727
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

09:53.761 --> 09:56.229
BOBBY: Listen, I like you.
You're a good firefighter.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.965
I know we got this thing--
you call me "Pops,"

09:57.998 --> 10:00.400
and I give you a hard time
for being a dumbass kid,

10:00.433 --> 10:02.169
we went to
a Springsteen concert together.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.738
But this is not a family.
It's not a clubhouse.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.974
-So I'm writing you up.
-Come on, Bobby.

10:07.007 --> 10:10.143
See the fire, put out the fire.
The rest is blah-blah.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.579
No. The system and the rules
are not arbitrary.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.582
First infraction.
Two more, you're out.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.617
Wash your hands.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.125
-Thanks. -You know,
you're not helping him

10:25.158 --> 10:26.526
by going easy on him.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.261
He just needs
a little direction.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.297
I'll remind you of that
after he gets you killed.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.968
Anyone want to pass me a spoon,

10:35.002 --> 10:37.637
so I can serve myself
some salad?

10:40.240 --> 10:41.308
Oh, no.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.542
No.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.056
Let's do it.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.162
-The fourth floor.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.731
I'll race you.
-Ah, race yourself, Rambo.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.599
I'm 50 years old.
I'm taking the elevator.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.633
Who's Rambo?

11:46.206 --> 11:48.175
I don't hear anything.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.111
Look, I'm telling you,
I heard a baby crying.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.948
Someone flushed a baby
down the toilet.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.217
Oh, I'm not high.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.220
Okay, I-I'm pretty high,
but it's a sativa.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.789
You know? I-It makes you happy.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.123
I-It doesn't
make you hallucinate.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.591
It could've been a cat, right?

12:04.624 --> 12:06.726
Sometimes rats get stuck
in the walls.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.062
-Shh.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.964
Did you hear that?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.711
Hey, do you know what,
can you give me a stethoscope?

12:24.744 --> 12:26.746
-Okay.
-Thanks.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.757
Give me a pen.
Give me a Sharpie.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.997
-Hey!
-All right.

12:44.031 --> 12:46.599
-We need to open up this wall.
-No, no. We're being punked.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.635
It's a tape recorder
or something. Right, Spicoli?

12:48.668 --> 12:50.003
Mm-mm. Maybe he's right.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.806
Maybe a mother gives birth
on the toilet and flushes it.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.274
Okay, first of all,
that's awful.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.743
Second, do you not know
how a toilet pipe works?

12:56.776 --> 12:58.411
There's this piece of serpentine
pipe that takes the waste

12:58.445 --> 13:01.014
-from the toilet to...
-If this is a premature baby,

13:01.048 --> 13:02.682
its bones could bend
and compress like sponges.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.251
Okay? We need to go in there.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.753
-Stand back. I got this!
-Whoa! -Hey, hey, hey!

13:06.786 --> 13:09.589
Did you even stop to consider
that you might hit a baby?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.625
Yeah, I didn't think so.
Go get the saw.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.594
Okay. I'm, uh, I'm gonna...

13:14.627 --> 13:17.865
Try to find some common sense
while you're down there.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.010
Fire and Rescue
were first to arrive.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.012
Theory is that some kid
gave birth on a toilet

13:32.045 --> 13:34.681
and tried to flush the evidence,
which got stuck in a pipe.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.950
Theory? Has anyone
located the mother

13:36.984 --> 13:39.686
to see if the theory's correct?

13:39.719 --> 13:41.955
How many floors above where
you were hearing the crying?

13:41.989 --> 13:44.624
-Uh, floor five and floor six.
-All right, let's start on five.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.393
Knock on every door.
Don't be shy about going in

13:46.426 --> 13:47.794
if something doesn't seem right.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.329
Don't we need a warrant
or something?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.631
Do I look like I'm asking you
to make an arrest?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.366
-Let's do this.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.173
LAPD!

14:00.207 --> 14:02.309
LAPD. LAPD.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.711
Hey. You have a teenage girl
living here?

14:04.744 --> 14:08.481
LAPD. LAPD.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.816
All right.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.751
All right, let's get it out.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
Guys, that-that pipe services

14:23.696 --> 14:26.066
a quarter of the toilets
above us; that's gonna be messy.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.501
Oh, shoot.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.503
Which means,
even with the water off,

14:30.537 --> 14:32.439
if somebody flushes
a toilet above us,

14:32.472 --> 14:34.474
it could drown the baby.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.378
LAPD. Open up, sir.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.348
-Do you have a teenage girl
living here with you? -I wish.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.250
HEN: Do not flush your toilet!
This is LAFD.

14:43.283 --> 14:45.085
No one flush your toilets!

14:45.118 --> 14:46.753
Do not flush your toilet!

14:46.786 --> 14:48.055
This is LAFD!

14:48.088 --> 14:49.856
Again, no one flush your toilet!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.624
Hey, Hen. How's your day going?

14:51.658 --> 14:53.026
Athena, peachy.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.028
Do not flush your toilets!

14:55.062 --> 14:58.531
-LAPD. Open up. LAPD! LAPD!
-This is LAFD. Please.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.201
-LAPD.
-Nobody flush your toilets!

15:01.234 --> 15:02.702
Okay? Please, don't.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.105
Hey, sir. Sir!

15:12.812 --> 15:15.949
Sir, we're looking for a girl...
Uh, hey!

15:17.951 --> 15:19.953
*

15:45.979 --> 15:46.980
Chimney.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.648
Cut right down here
on the bottom.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.993
All right, Chimney,
help me out, help me out.

16:00.027 --> 16:01.328
Easy, easy, easy.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.829
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.097
Up, hold it up.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.199
-Hold it up.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.368
All right. All right,
I see it. I see it.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.104
-Down. Let's pull it down here
at the bottom.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.306
-Buck, I got it.
-You got to cut right here.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.344
-Yeah.
-Hold it still.

16:31.858 --> 16:32.825
All right, it's off.

16:32.859 --> 16:35.628
Get the head out, Bobby.
Get the head out.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.197
Yeah. You got to push
from below.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.665
All right.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.405
Get the defibrillator.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.074
-I'm on it.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.975
Yeah.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.310
-Just the lube, Buck.
-All right. Here, Bobby.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.179
Take it, take it.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.414
All right, give it...

16:58.251 --> 17:00.087
All right, work that in there,
work that in there.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.856
-Got it up there. I got it.
I got it. -All right, guys.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.024
Wow, wow. Wow.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.493
This is gonna be
a scoop and run.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.162
Hen, get the ambulance ready.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.430
I'm ready here.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.099
BOBBY:
Okay, ready?

17:13.366 --> 17:14.867
Come on.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.903
-It's moving.
-It's coming. It's coming.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.740
Oh, my God.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.419
-Stay on the shoulders.
-I got it. I got it.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.187
-I got it. -Pull, pull.
All right. Geez.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.588
Okay, pull her out.
Pull her out. Pull her out.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.390
-Pull her out.
-I got it. I got it. I got it.

17:37.424 --> 17:39.692
All right, she's not breathing.
Starting CPR.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.960
Come on.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.430
Come on. Come on.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.198
-Maybe her airway's blocked.
-Yeah. -I-I'll get the, uh...

17:45.232 --> 17:47.033
Yep.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.001
-Get the pump. -Buck, come on!
-I'm coming! I'm...

17:52.405 --> 17:54.641
Yeah, she's not breathing.
Bobby, it's-it's not working.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.543
Come on.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.810
-Come on.
-I got you.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.279
-I got you.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.382
-There we go. There we go.
-Excellent.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.883
There we go.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.387
: Yeah.

18:07.420 --> 18:08.921
All right.
Okay, wrap her up.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.957
-Let's go.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.660
-Down to the lobby. Here we go.
-All right, let's go, let's go.

18:17.164 --> 18:19.098
-Guess not.

18:19.132 --> 18:21.301
Sorry, Cap.
Come on, come on, come on.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.471
Yo, give her to me.
Yo, come on, I'm twice as fast.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.572
Come on.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.240
-All right, you go.
-Okay.

18:27.274 --> 18:29.976
I got you.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.911
I got you. You're gonna be okay.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.446
You're gonna be great.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.089
What happened?!

18:43.122 --> 18:44.691
What you want?!

18:44.724 --> 18:46.726
No.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.365
MAN:
Marika.

18:52.399 --> 18:53.966
Your daughter just had a baby.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.802
We have to get her
to the hospital.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.807
Go get ready! Get ready!

19:00.840 --> 19:02.675
-Come on, move it!
-Come on, get ready!

19:02.709 --> 19:04.143
-Yeah, I got you.
-Let's go.

19:04.177 --> 19:05.945
-Make way, folks. Make way.
-Let's go, let's go!

19:05.978 --> 19:08.781
Make way.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.051
Hold up! Hold up!
I got another one coming.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.486
BUCK:
Yo, is that the mother? No.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.322
-Screw her! Look what she did!
-She's bleeding out!

19:15.355 --> 19:17.524
-She's a child!

19:17.557 --> 19:19.192
He is refusing to take...

19:19.226 --> 19:21.461
-Okay, Bob.
-All right, all right, come on.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.531
-Come on.
-Marika.

19:24.564 --> 19:25.698
Come on, guys. Hurry up.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.400
Okay? Hurry up!

19:27.434 --> 19:30.036
Yo, if this baby dies,
it's on you.

19:30.069 --> 19:31.137
MAN:
Marika.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.083
Hospital ETA, five minutes.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.385
Hang in.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.255
-Gonna go over here.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.223
Oh, yeah.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.425
-Okay.

19:52.459 --> 19:53.893
Oh, yeah.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.465
Whoa. All right.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.102
O2 sat 59.

20:04.704 --> 20:07.507
-I can't get a pulse.
-MARIKA: I'm so sorry.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.841
Is she gonna die?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.177
Come here.
Give me your hand.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.347
It's all right. It's okay.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.419
Here we go.

20:23.323 --> 20:25.592
All right.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.260
See? Told you we'd make it,
didn't I?

20:27.294 --> 20:28.861
Come on. Oh, here we go.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.763
You ready

20:30.797 --> 20:33.733
Oh. Hey.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.568
They're gonna
take care of you now, okay?

20:35.602 --> 20:37.069
You're gonna be okay now,
aren't you?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.771
-Get the baby to the NICU.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.740
-Get the mother hooked up
in room four. -All right.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.275
I'm gonna see you in there.
All right, come on, Bobby.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.543
-Let's go. -Hey, hey, hold on.
Where you going?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.478
That baby is alive
because of us.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.046
Don't-don't we have
some kind of obligation?

20:47.079 --> 20:48.448
I'll give them a call;
we'll be lucky

20:48.481 --> 20:49.949
if they tell us if she's okay.

20:49.982 --> 20:51.551
There's nothing more we can do.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.253
We did our jobs
very well today, so far.

20:54.287 --> 20:57.223
Just be proud of that.
Now it's their turn.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.395
-ATHENA: Hey!

21:02.429 --> 21:04.997
-You do not get to choose
who lives and who dies.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.098
'Cause I was
under the impression

21:06.132 --> 21:07.467
that kind of was my job.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.469
That mother was no less
of a child than her baby.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.270
You're gonna get someone killed.

21:11.304 --> 21:14.106
-Well, maybe, but not today.
-Yeah, you keep making jokes.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.344
I promise you,
the next time you screw up,

21:17.377 --> 21:19.278
it'll be your last.

21:26.553 --> 21:28.020
What?

21:28.054 --> 21:30.056
Get in the truck.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.938
Good morning, everyone.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.408
You want a waffle?

21:59.218 --> 22:01.020
ATHENA: Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
No whispering at the table.

22:01.053 --> 22:04.323
You got something to say,
just speak up.

22:04.357 --> 22:06.893
Would it be okay
if only one of you guys

22:06.926 --> 22:09.729
came to family day
at school tomorrow?

22:09.762 --> 22:12.899
-MAY: Because you can't stand

22:12.932 --> 22:14.701
being in the same room together,
anyway.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.202
It makes everyone uncomfortable.

22:16.235 --> 22:17.804
Are you getting a divorce?

22:17.837 --> 22:20.873
-Of course not, sweetheart.
-You're lying.

22:20.907 --> 22:22.875
-Hey, watch your mouth.
-ATHENA: Baby.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.211
Married people have problems
all the time.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.979
But you two never fight or argue

22:27.013 --> 22:28.448
unless it's something
really bad.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.687
-I want to tell them.
-Michael.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.756
My therapist said tell them
when they're ready.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.025
Well-well, I'm saying
that I'm not ready.

22:41.293 --> 22:42.995
-Come here. Come here, baby.
-Michael.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.234
Kids, your dad
has been struggling

22:48.267 --> 22:50.770
-with something his entire life.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.372
But...

22:53.406 --> 22:57.844
with the courage
that I get from being your dad,

22:57.877 --> 23:00.880
-the way that you love me
and see me... -Please.

23:02.782 --> 23:06.653
...I feel strong enough
to be honest about it.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.757
I'm gay.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.361
So you are getting a divorce.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.897
No, no, sweetheart. We're not
even talking about that.

23:17.930 --> 23:23.770
May, baby, y-your dad just
told me a couple of weeks ago.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.773
The grandmas are gonna whisper
about us in church now.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.141
And the kids at school
are gonna find out,

23:29.175 --> 23:32.378
-and maybe beat Harry and I up
about it. -MICHAEL: No. No.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.715
Your mother and I will not let
that happen. Do you understand?

23:35.748 --> 23:37.550
Can't you just keep it a secret?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.586
I'm fine with whatever.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.589
I just don't want
anybody else to know.

23:42.622 --> 23:45.525
May, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Look...

23:52.999 --> 23:55.768
Don't look at me like that.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.837
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

23:59.472 --> 24:02.241
You know, I get that
you feel good about coming out.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.610
-Good for you.
-Please.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.011
But don't think you can hide

24:05.044 --> 24:07.480
behind that pride
when it comes to me.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.215
You lied to me.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.154
-Oh, God. I'm sorry.
-Get-- Don't you touch me!

24:15.187 --> 24:17.957
-Don't you touch me! How could
you do this to me?! -Okay.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.126
-You should have told me
from the beginning!

24:20.159 --> 24:23.329
-I didn't have to tell you. You
already knew.

24:23.362 --> 24:25.498
-But you just went along
to get along. -Oh, I'm sorry

24:25.532 --> 24:27.099
if I thought
that the fact that my husband

24:27.133 --> 24:29.301
didn't pay other women any mind
meant he was true to me!

24:29.335 --> 24:30.670
Look, you even said it yourself.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.305
I don't lay you like other men.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.810
You humiliated me

24:37.844 --> 24:40.179
just so you wouldn't
humiliate yourself.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.049
And if you don't see that,
you're the one that's in denial.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.984
-Yes.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.786
Hey, you know,
denial worked just fine

24:46.819 --> 24:49.455
when you were
a 37-year-old single woman

24:49.488 --> 24:53.159
whose biological clock
was running out.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.127
You were perfectly happy to deny

24:55.161 --> 24:56.996
what you could clearly see
about me.

24:57.029 --> 25:01.233
And I said
that I wanted those kids, too.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.670
Don't you forget that!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.087
What is that?

25:23.022 --> 25:25.024
You've had it, like,
a million times, Mom.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.258
Don't think I like it.

25:26.292 --> 25:27.827
-Well...
-Why don't you save it

25:27.860 --> 25:30.730
for when your dad
gets back from work, hmm?

25:34.133 --> 25:37.003
He's not coming home, is he?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.705
-No.
-Oh.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.573
-Yeah.

25:40.607 --> 25:42.008
Mm, yeah.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.843
For, like, ten years.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.278
-Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Don't be sorry.

25:46.312 --> 25:48.915
-You're just having
a tough day today. -Hmm.

25:48.948 --> 25:52.018
And Veronica's here.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.120
Veronica,
you're half an hour late.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.188
I have to get to work.
You can't keep doing this,

25:56.222 --> 25:58.124
-or I'm gonna have to hire
somebody else. -Whatever.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.192
I work for SSI.
I can't be fired,

26:00.226 --> 26:02.194
just moved off to someone else.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.797
Wow, I really love
that go-getter attitude, V.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.299
-I love you, Mom.
-Love you, darling.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.468
You take care
of yourself today, okay?

26:16.442 --> 26:18.144
Bye, Mom.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.501
My snake.

26:57.516 --> 26:59.518
L.A. fire!

27:01.721 --> 27:03.956
All right, guys,
check all these rooms.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.559
Anybody here?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.732
L.A. fire!

27:18.070 --> 27:19.672
Wow.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.978
Oh, my God.

27:26.012 --> 27:28.547
Bobby, I can't do snakes.
They scare the crap out of me.

27:28.580 --> 27:30.549
That scene from Conan the
Barbarian with the giant snake,

27:30.582 --> 27:31.951
it traumatized me for life.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.519
-I-I can't.

27:33.552 --> 27:34.887
Conan the Barbarian.
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.188
1982. Geez.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.656
Dude, as far as I'm concerned,

27:37.690 --> 27:39.525
the world began
the day I was born.

27:39.558 --> 27:42.228
BOBBY: Guys, in here.
Back here, guys, now.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.702
HEN:
Oh, my God.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.971
-We got to help her get
some air, guys. -Oh, my...

27:52.004 --> 27:54.240
-Oh, my God. Oh, I...
This is not good.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.709
HEN: Bobby, it's no use. That
thing is, like, ten feet long.

27:56.743 --> 27:59.145
Its constriction strength is,
like, 50 pounds per square inch.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.813
Oh, my God, I'm gonna start
calling you "Snake-ipedia."

28:00.847 --> 28:02.414
-Stop it.
-All I'm saying

28:02.448 --> 28:04.083
is that you'd stand
a better chance

28:04.116 --> 28:06.185
of tearing down a cement wall
with your bare hands.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.887
Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.189
You can't punch it in the face,
Buck. It's a snake.

28:10.222 --> 28:11.991
It's not some guy
at an El Torito happy hour.

28:12.024 --> 28:13.159
HEN:
Look, I have Dilaudid.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.594
We can inject the snake.
It'll pass right out.

28:15.627 --> 28:17.163
BOBBY: How much time
is that gonna take?

28:17.196 --> 28:18.264
Minutes.
And minutes we don't have.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.066
I think we're gonna
have to put it down.

28:20.099 --> 28:21.901
-Kill it.
No! No, um, no!

28:21.934 --> 28:23.535
-Kill it. Just kill it.
-It's a snake.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.205
-It's doing what nature intended
for it to do.

28:26.238 --> 28:28.775
Nobody told this fool to bring
a snake into her house!

28:28.808 --> 28:31.177
Yeah, well, I'll make a donation
to PETA for you.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.746
-Crap.
It's getting really tight.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.681
BUCK:
Okay, stand back.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.950
-We don't have time for this!
-Buck! -No!

28:41.720 --> 28:43.756
Okay.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.892
Wow. Why is that always

28:45.925 --> 28:47.960
the first option for you
white boy, macho tough guys?

28:47.994 --> 28:50.229
Guys, I am totally gonna take
credit for this with Tatiana.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.731
It's gonna get me laid
for a week. Thank you.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.701
Oh, Spartacus.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.736
Yeah, well,
it was him or you, and, uh,

28:57.770 --> 29:00.406
when faced
with a situation like that,

29:00.439 --> 29:03.142
I always choose to save
the more attractive one.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.643
Is that right?

29:04.676 --> 29:06.545
-Oh, yeah, that's right.
-HEN: Okay.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.715
Hard pass. I'm gonna skip the
part where the two idiots flirt.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.819
You can expect a visit
from animal control.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.756
Hey, Buck.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.491
-Oh.
-Ah.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.793
Really?
-Um...

29:54.827 --> 29:57.196
I'm a collector.
I'm not a hoarder.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.531
I think you should
probably leave.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.000
Um, did you follow me here?

30:01.033 --> 30:03.169
The truck has
a GPS beacon, moron.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.771
-Ugh.
-No. W...

30:05.804 --> 30:07.773
Just call me later
if you're free.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.342
I'll be at home. Alone.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.480
You're fired.

30:14.513 --> 30:17.149
What? Wait. That's not fair.
You said I got three strikes.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.784
Doesn't matter. You've made
this choice yourself,

30:18.817 --> 30:20.352
and you rubbed it in my face.

30:20.386 --> 30:24.223
The same exact infraction
two days after I wrote you up.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.659
It's not 1950 anymore, Buck.
We work with women side by side.

30:27.693 --> 30:30.029
When you swing your dick around,
you disrespect them.

30:30.062 --> 30:34.033
Wait, Bobby! Bobby, I-I think
I may be a sex addict.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.769
Self-diagnosed.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.706
You think this is a joke?

30:40.739 --> 30:42.174
-No.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.176
-I'm not joking.
-How much does your kit weigh

30:44.210 --> 30:45.477
when you're fully geared up?

30:45.511 --> 30:46.812
-Uh, I don't, I don't know.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.814
-60 pounds, give or take.
-Right. 60 pounds.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.517
So when you choose this life,
you find a way

30:51.550 --> 30:53.986
to leave everything behind you,
except that 60 pounds.

30:54.020 --> 30:57.323
I don't care if you got problems
with your wife, with money,

30:57.356 --> 30:59.591
with alcohol,
with keeping it in your pants.

30:59.625 --> 31:02.228
All that stuff weighs you down,
it slows you down,

31:02.261 --> 31:05.531
and if we lose a couple seconds,
people die.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.600
So, you want to disrespect
yourself, that's fine with me.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.037
You want to disrespect these
women that you chase around,

31:11.070 --> 31:14.006
that's on them, but you are done
disrespecting our firehouse

31:14.040 --> 31:16.408
and this fire department.

31:16.442 --> 31:19.111
No, Bobby. Bobby!
I need this job!

31:19.145 --> 31:20.913
Look, I love this job.

31:20.947 --> 31:23.315
Don't do this to me.

31:25.317 --> 31:29.021
I don't have anything else.

31:29.055 --> 31:31.723
I'm sorry, kid.
I said you're done.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.118
I guess you heard?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.987
Yeah.

32:01.020 --> 32:04.790
For what it's worth,
everyone thinks it sucks.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.793
-It's my own fault.
-Yeah.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.596
Everyone thinks that, too.

32:10.629 --> 32:12.431
I'll be honest.

32:12.464 --> 32:14.833
When Bobby first
brought you on board,

32:14.866 --> 32:17.336
I told him he should just
get a Dalmatian instead.

32:19.305 --> 32:23.109
But I'm legit sorry
to see you go.

32:23.142 --> 32:25.844
You got some skills.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.280
Just not a lot of discipline.

32:28.314 --> 32:32.018
Look, hey, um, I don't suppose

32:32.051 --> 32:33.986
you could maybe
talk to him for me?

32:35.387 --> 32:38.257
DISPATCHER : Ladder,
medic. 10-36 auto emergency.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.359
Hey, tough break, kid.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.361
DISPATCHER: Ladder, medic.
10-36 auto emergency.

32:42.394 --> 32:43.996
Hen, let's roll.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.961
Okay, Lily, my name is Abby.
I'm gonna try to help you.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.363
-I don't know.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.964
-We just moved here.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.067
-Do you know what street
you live on? -Um, Lambert.

33:21.100 --> 33:22.968
Okay, Lambert.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.970
It's a brown house!

33:25.003 --> 33:28.040
Lily?

33:28.074 --> 33:30.376
-Shoot.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.910
Residential break-in.

33:31.943 --> 33:34.546
Caller is a nine-year-old
female, home alone.

33:34.580 --> 33:36.982
No GPS on her phone,
no street address.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.818
She did have a street name--
Lambert.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.388
There are three Lamberts
in the greater L.A. area:

33:42.421 --> 33:45.857
Boyle Heights,
Santa Fe Springs and Winnetka.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.194
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I can hear you.

33:48.227 --> 33:50.529
-They got in.

33:50.562 --> 33:52.498
-I'm up in my room.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.033
Okay. That's okay.
What is the name of your city?

33:55.067 --> 33:57.035
W-Winnetka.

33:57.069 --> 33:59.037
Okay. We got to start
pinging cell towers.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.073
-Pinging towers in the Valley.
-ABBY: Now, listen.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.542
I need you to stay on the phone.
Don't hang up.

34:03.575 --> 34:05.010
We're gonna try to find you.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.712
I've got multiple
daytime break-ins

34:06.745 --> 34:08.514
in this area over
the last couple of months.

34:08.547 --> 34:09.915
Lily, is there anything near you

34:09.948 --> 34:11.683
that looks like it would have
your address on it?

34:11.717 --> 34:14.586
Mail or anything like that?

34:14.620 --> 34:17.289
Can you look outside?

34:19.791 --> 34:22.428
LILY:
I can't see any numbers.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.299
TERRY: Towers narrow it
to a quarter mile.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.067
I know you said your house is
brown. Is there anything else

34:30.636 --> 34:33.038
ABBY:
All available units,

34:33.071 --> 34:34.873
residential break-in
on Lambert Road, Winnetka,

34:34.906 --> 34:36.942
somewhere between
the 100 and 1500 blocks

34:36.975 --> 34:38.644
of Chanel and Hadley.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.312
Two-story
single family dwelling.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.047
Brown house, white trim,

34:42.080 --> 34:44.450
garage door is white.
Child alone in the home.

34:44.483 --> 34:46.885
Caller says there's a pink
girl's five-speed bike

34:46.918 --> 34:48.620
sitting on the front porch.

34:48.654 --> 34:50.722
You got to be kidding me.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.959
I'm in Steven Spielberg land.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.063
-LILY: I'm here.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.064
What's your mother's name?

34:59.097 --> 35:00.766
Emma.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.901
Emma Coughlin.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.636
Okay, we got 14 Emma Coughlins.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.138
None of them in Winnetka.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.606
ABBY:
Do you know her phone number?

35:07.639 --> 35:09.608
-Uh, it's in the phone.
-Here's what I want you to do.

35:09.641 --> 35:11.843
Do not hang up the phone.
Look at the menu in the phone,

35:11.877 --> 35:13.245
and read me
what the number says.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.980
-I think so.

35:15.013 --> 35:18.116
-Stay on the line. I'm gonna
call your mom now. -Okay.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.963
LILY:
It's ringing in her room.

35:31.997 --> 35:33.999
Sometimes she forgets it
on the charger.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.836
ABBY: Officer, maybe if you put
on your siren,

35:37.869 --> 35:40.472
I could determine where you are
in relation to her.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.508
-I could guide you to her.
-I don't think we want

35:42.541 --> 35:44.476
these guys knowing
that the cops are here.

35:44.510 --> 35:47.213
This area's had a spate
of daytime break-ins recently,

35:47.246 --> 35:48.547
and one homicide.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.949
We need to find this girl.

35:50.982 --> 35:54.553
Maybe we still can.

35:56.588 --> 35:57.989
HEN:
Hey. What's up, Thena?

35:58.023 --> 35:59.625
ATHENA :
I need a favor.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.360
Think you can loan me
a fire truck?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.895
Um, it's kind of in use
at the moment. Why?

36:06.732 --> 36:09.435
I'll have something for you
in less than five.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.150
She sent you, huh?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.386
I was available.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.490
All right. No heroics.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.024
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

36:33.058 --> 36:34.860
I don't know what that means.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.828
Nobody thought you would.

36:42.133 --> 36:44.403
Lily?

36:44.436 --> 36:46.204
:
Abby, I'm downstairs.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.573
ABBY:
What are you doing downstairs?

36:49.941 --> 36:51.910
Petey! Petey!

36:51.943 --> 36:55.414
Petey! There's a kid
in the house who's got a phone.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.749
PETEY:
That's twice you said my name.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.285
Now we got to find it.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.029
PETEY :
I'll get this one's phone.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.699
Just need the phone.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.079
(siren wailing,
horn honking over phone)

37:29.247 --> 37:31.883
DEAN:
It's the cops!

37:37.923 --> 37:39.991
-We've got it.
-That's it.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.259
You just passed her, cowboy.

37:42.528 --> 37:45.831
Relax. It's just a fire truck.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.166
Come on, kid.
I just want the phone.

37:51.370 --> 37:52.971
BUCK:
Oh, yeah, I see the pink bike.

37:59.044 --> 38:01.480
-Yeah.

38:01.513 --> 38:02.981
You, uh, you can't go
in there right now.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.516
Is there a fire?
-No, no.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.017
-No, ma'am, no fire. Just come.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.553
Just get behind the truck, okay?
Come on.

38:12.558 --> 38:15.594
PETEY: Come out, kid.
We just want the phone.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.363
-DEAN: Petey!

38:17.396 --> 38:18.864
I got her!

38:18.897 --> 38:20.866
Officer, how close are you?

38:20.899 --> 38:22.701
Close.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.140
Abby!

38:29.174 --> 38:32.143
Petey! Petey, Petey!

38:32.177 --> 38:33.845
Petey! Petey!

38:33.879 --> 38:36.982
Peter! Petey! Petey!

38:37.015 --> 38:40.386
-Peter! Petey!

38:40.419 --> 38:42.287
This is 911 operator
Abby Clark.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.322
I need to explain something
to you about this emergency.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.191
This emergency is yours.
I have dispatched the police

38:46.224 --> 38:47.793
to your exact location.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.461
I know exactly what road
they're gonna go down,

38:49.495 --> 38:50.862
I know what door
they're gonna walk into,

38:50.896 --> 38:52.364
and I am prepared
to help you escape.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.868
-Because I don't care

38:56.902 --> 38:58.804
about you at all, but I care
about that little girl.

38:58.837 --> 39:00.972
So you have exactly two seconds
to make a decision here.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.874
You can either walk away
from her and walk away

39:02.908 --> 39:05.176
from the police,
or you can sit there and wait

39:05.210 --> 39:07.746
for whatever hellfire is about
to be brought down on your head.

39:11.049 --> 39:13.151
-PETEY: Get the kid.

39:13.184 --> 39:15.220
No! No.

39:15.253 --> 39:16.855
No! No! No!

39:16.888 --> 39:18.524
What are you doing?! No!

39:18.557 --> 39:19.958
No! No!

39:21.192 --> 39:22.594
Okay, walk out the back door.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.162
There's a road behind the house.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.330
Back door.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.832
What about the bike, man?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.534
-Forget the bike.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.035
LILY:
Let me out! Please!

39:30.068 --> 39:32.237
-PETEY: Yeah, I see it.

39:32.270 --> 39:34.072
-Because I have a grid

39:34.105 --> 39:35.741
of the entire neighborhood
in front of me.

39:35.774 --> 39:38.343
-You're gonna go over the wall.
-Better not be any cops

39:38.376 --> 39:40.546
-on the other side.
-ATHENA: There aren't.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.080
Just needed you
out of the house.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.949
Get on the ground!

39:43.982 --> 39:45.250
Get on the ground now!

39:45.283 --> 39:46.718
Petey!

39:46.752 --> 39:49.254
-You lying bitch!
-ATHENA: Down! Down!

39:49.287 --> 39:52.390
LILY:
Let me out!

39:52.424 --> 39:53.959
Fireman Buckley,
what's going on there?

39:53.992 --> 39:55.627
-I don't know, uh...
-LILY: Stop it!

39:55.661 --> 39:57.563
Please! Help!

39:57.596 --> 39:59.364
-Lily!
-Oh, crap.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.032
-Help me!

40:01.066 --> 40:02.267
PETEY:
Ow.

40:05.637 --> 40:06.605
Mom!

40:06.638 --> 40:08.239
-Lily!
-Mom!

40:10.108 --> 40:11.743
-Oh, my God.

40:11.777 --> 40:12.978
ABBY:
Officer.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.145
Fireman Buckley,
what's happening?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.981
Are the suspects in custody?

40:17.115 --> 40:19.217
Attention, all units.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.386
Suspect on a motorcycle,
heading east on Lambert.

40:21.419 --> 40:22.854
-East on Lambert.

40:30.462 --> 40:32.230
Move! Move!

40:32.263 --> 40:34.132
Cover, cover, cover!

40:52.317 --> 40:53.785
ABBY:
Fireman Buckley?

40:53.819 --> 40:55.687
ATHENA:
Don't you move!

40:55.721 --> 40:57.689
-Don't you move. -ABBY: Fireman
Buckley, what's happening there?

40:57.723 --> 40:59.958
Fireman Buckley,
what's happening there?!

40:59.991 --> 41:02.528
-PETEY: Ow, I'm hurt!
-No, you just think you are.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.196
ABBY: I heard a gunshot.
Is Where is she?

41:05.230 --> 41:06.798
BUCK:
The little girl? No, she's good.

41:06.832 --> 41:09.835
She's back with her mom,
and you should be here.

41:09.868 --> 41:12.771
Oh, my God.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.107
I feel like I am.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.443
Wow. Um...

41:18.476 --> 41:20.879
Okay, well,
I can't thank you enough.

41:20.912 --> 41:23.148
I-I... I'm so grateful.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.817
-You saved that little girl,
and... -No, you did.

41:25.851 --> 41:29.555
You kept her in the game
long enough for us to find her.

41:29.588 --> 41:31.690
You're the real hero here.

41:31.723 --> 41:35.894
Well, I appreciate you
saying that.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.729
Thank you.

42:14.966 --> 42:17.603
I know what this looks like.

42:17.636 --> 42:20.238
Looks like you took the engine
out in your street clothes.

42:20.271 --> 42:22.540
I didn't really
have time to change.

42:22.574 --> 42:23.775
Athena Grant called me,

42:23.809 --> 42:25.844
wanted to tell me
what an asset you are.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.345
Told her she was half right.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.847
("Under Pressure"
by Queen playing)

42:30.381 --> 42:32.517
MICHAEL :
Athena.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.753
Uh, kids get home
from school okay?

42:34.786 --> 42:36.421
Yeah, yeah.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.423
They're inside
doing their homework.

42:38.456 --> 42:41.526
Everything okay?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.528
Yeah. Just checking in.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.096
You giving me another chance?

42:45.130 --> 42:47.633
You've used all your chances;
so have I.

42:47.666 --> 42:50.301
Because somehow I have failed
to communicate to you

42:50.335 --> 42:53.104
how lucky we are
to do what we do.

42:53.138 --> 42:54.539
* Pressure...

42:54.572 --> 42:56.875
You're wrong, Bobby.

42:56.908 --> 43:00.111
I absolutely do get what
a privilege it is to serve here.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.914
And you know what?
You were right to fire me.

43:02.948 --> 43:04.750
I was a punk.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.719
Uh, I still am one.

43:07.753 --> 43:10.756
But I'm a punk
who understands what he lost.

43:13.124 --> 43:16.261
Just needed you to know that.

43:16.294 --> 43:18.764
I hope you mean that.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.099
So are we talking again now?

43:21.132 --> 43:23.735
No.

43:23.769 --> 43:27.806
MICHAEL: You want us
to wait for you for dinner?

43:27.839 --> 43:32.177
* Tomorrow gets me higher...

43:32.210 --> 43:34.179
Yeah. Yeah.

43:34.212 --> 43:36.314
Go get dressed.

43:36.347 --> 43:37.949
* Da-da-da

43:37.983 --> 43:39.450
* Ooh

43:39.484 --> 43:41.252
* Da-da-da-da-da

43:41.286 --> 43:42.688
* Okay...

43:42.721 --> 43:44.189
I think I'm not fired.

43:44.222 --> 43:45.824
Your shift's not over yet.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.659
* Chipping around

43:47.693 --> 43:49.828
-* Kick my brains
around the floor *

43:49.861 --> 43:52.764
* These are the days,
it never rains but it pours... *

44:01.907 --> 44:03.675
* People on streets

44:03.709 --> 44:05.010
* Ee-da-de-da-de

44:05.043 --> 44:08.179
* People on streets

44:08.213 --> 44:09.948
* Ee-da-de-da-de-de-da

44:09.981 --> 44:11.683
* It's the terror of knowing

44:11.717 --> 44:14.185
-* What this world is about

44:14.219 --> 44:16.321
-* Watching some good friends

44:16.354 --> 44:18.189
* Screaming, "Let me out!"

44:18.223 --> 44:20.726
* Tomorrow

44:20.759 --> 44:23.128
* Gets me higher,
higher, higher *

44:23.161 --> 44:25.196
* Pressure on people

44:25.230 --> 44:27.999
* People on streets,
under pressure... *

44:28.033 --> 44:30.335
ABBY: You know, it takes
a certain kind of person

44:30.368 --> 44:33.138
to swim in the pain
of the world and not get wet.

44:33.171 --> 44:35.974
To run towards danger,
rather than run away from it.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.676
And for those of us
that choose this life,

44:38.710 --> 44:40.178
there's no place
we'd rather be.

44:40.211 --> 44:42.080
911. What's your emergency?

44:49.620 --> 44:53.224
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

45:24.990 --> 45:26.958
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.660
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

45:53.819 --> 45:56.454
* Hey-ay-ay *

45:56.487 --> 45:59.324
