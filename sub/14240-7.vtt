<i>Torchwood</i>

00:05.200 --> 00:07.965
<i>Outside the Government,
beyond the police.</i>

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
<i>Fighting for the future
on behalf of the human race.</i>

00:12.200 --> 00:14.400
<i>The 21st century

00:37.200 --> 00:39.865
The time is 2130.

00:39.900 --> 00:42.065
This is Doctor Martha Jones.

00:42.100 --> 00:46.900
Autopsy on Owen Harper,
caucasian, age 27.

00:46.935 --> 00:49.665
Torchwood officer 565.

00:49.700 --> 00:53.100
Time of death witnessed
at approximately 2030.

00:53.135 --> 00:55.300
Autopsy begins.

01:04.900 --> 01:09.300
STOP! Nobody touches him
til I get back, is that clear?

01:24.500 --> 01:25.865
It's all right.

01:25.900 --> 01:29.300
I've been looking forward
to seeing the captain again.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.600
Can you see where it is?

01:33.635 --> 01:35.700
You'll owe me a favour.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.500
Well?

01:42.100 --> 01:44.700
- They hid it in a church?
- No.

01:44.900 --> 01:46.700
When the people found out
what it could do,

01:47.100 --> 01:49.300
they built the church
on top of it.

01:50.700 --> 01:53.300
If I told you not to use it,
would you listen?

01:53.335 --> 01:55.700
Shouldn't you know
the answer to that?

01:56.500 --> 01:59.500
I do. That's the problem.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.100
Jack...?

04:20.899 --> 04:22.700
Jack, what have you got?

04:32.700 --> 04:33.665
Oh, my God.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.300
You can't use it. Not after Suzie.

04:35.335 --> 04:36.417
I'm using the glove.

04:36.452 --> 04:37.500
I'm bringing Owen back.

04:49.100 --> 04:51.700
Are you really going to use that
after what happened last time?

04:51.735 --> 04:53.117
Jack, the gloves are dangerous.

04:53.152 --> 04:54.465
At best it'll give us
two minutes.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.700
At worst... who knows
what will happen?

04:56.735 --> 04:57.865
It's not up for discussion.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.600
I thought the glove
didn't work for you.

04:59.635 --> 05:01.300
Different glove,
different circumstances.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.017
This time,
it has to work for me.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.665
I'm not going to give it
any choice.

05:04.700 --> 05:07.900
Okay, if you've got anything
you need to say to Owen,

05:08.500 --> 05:10.100
now's your chance.

05:27.700 --> 05:29.100
Owen...

05:29.900 --> 05:31.900
it's Jack, can you hear me?

05:34.700 --> 05:39.900
Owen, hear my voice,
get a hold of it,

05:40.300 --> 05:42.900
let it draw you out,
pull you out.

05:42.935 --> 05:45.500
I'm not getting any vital signs.

05:48.700 --> 05:51.465
Owen, it's me, Jack.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.500
He's coming, he's coming!

05:55.900 --> 05:57.465
Oh, my God!

05:57.500 --> 05:59.000
What happened? Where am I?

05:59.035 --> 06:00.465
Oh, God I'm shot, he shot me!

06:00.500 --> 06:03.265
Owen, you need to listen to me,
we don't have long.

06:03.300 --> 06:06.300
Where am I? This isn't the hospital,
this is the autopsy room.

06:06.335 --> 06:08.500
What am I doing here?
Jack, oh, no!

06:08.535 --> 06:09.817
What's that? What's that?

06:09.852 --> 06:11.065
The resurrection glove.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.100
We lost you,
but I brought you back.

06:14.900 --> 06:15.665
How long have I got?

06:15.700 --> 06:17.100
We're at thirty seconds
and counting.

06:17.135 --> 06:18.665
Oh, no. Jesus. Really?

06:18.700 --> 06:22.300
Okay, team,
say your goodbyes. Gwen!

06:22.700 --> 06:24.900
No offence, but I've only
got two minutes to live.

06:24.935 --> 06:26.265
Tosh!

06:26.300 --> 06:28.500
I'm gonna miss you.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.950
And I love you.

06:30.985 --> 06:32.565
I always have.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.600
Owen, I need the code
for the alien morgue.

06:34.635 --> 06:36.165
You're the only one who knows it.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.000
You brought me back
for that? For that?!

06:38.035 --> 06:39.200
I'm sorry.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.600
Jack, it's 231165. Okay?

06:44.800 --> 06:49.400
Sorry, and to help you prepare.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.400
I know what death is.

06:52.435 --> 06:54.600
I want you to be ready.

06:55.200 --> 06:58.200
There's nothing. Just darkness.

06:58.235 --> 06:59.600
Two minutes.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.800
- Jack, Jack..
- Be brave.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.600
Owen! Owen!

07:45.600 --> 07:48.600
I'm really gonna need
that hand back.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.565
Owen?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.800
Two minutes, twenty?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.800
Look, I'm not using the glove.

07:56.835 --> 07:58.017
But I'm still here.

07:58.052 --> 07:59.200
Oh, here we go again.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.365
Maybe I cheated it somehow.

08:10.400 --> 08:14.000
Maybe I wasn't meant to die
so I'm being kept alive.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.800
Ah, somebody pass me
my pants, please.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.800
<i>It's okay. I hate to say it,
but you'll get used to it.</i>

08:29.200 --> 08:31.365
No heartbeat, there's no pulse.

08:31.400 --> 08:33.799
Owen, you can't lead
the investigation.

08:33.835 --> 08:34.365
Why not?

08:34.400 --> 08:37.400
Because you're the subject of it,
and because you're dead.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.400
Are you sure about that?

08:38.434 --> 08:39.365
Yes, I'm sure.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.600
Well, I'm okay. Look, there's
electrical activity in my brain.

08:42.635 --> 08:43.365
That shouldn't be possible.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.800
Well, I'm still here
and actually I feel amazing!

08:45.835 --> 08:47.165
So where's the power coming from?

08:47.200 --> 08:49.200
Suzie survived because she
was draining energy from me.

08:49.235 --> 08:51.400
Owen could be doing
the same to Jack.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.400
I feel fine.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.800
The Philemon filter
detects biochemical energy.

09:01.835 --> 09:04.200
It's how we knew Suzie
was draining Gwen.

09:04.235 --> 09:05.600
<i>And?</i>

09:06.200 --> 09:07.165
Nothing.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.200
There's no connection
between them.

09:08.235 --> 09:09.365
It's not Jack.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.365
I told you, I feel fine.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.565
So what's keeping me ticking?

09:12.600 --> 09:15.000
I mean, the energy in my brain
must be coming from somewhere.

09:15.035 --> 09:17.017
This glove is different
to the other one.

09:17.052 --> 09:19.000
Maybe different gloves
do different things?

09:19.035 --> 09:21.117
- How many are there?
- Two.

09:21.152 --> 09:23.165
Well, they tend to come in pairs.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.000
We fished the first one out
of the harbour last year.

09:25.035 --> 09:27.000
But where does it come from,
originally?

09:27.035 --> 09:28.400
<i>Good question.</i>

09:29.200 --> 09:30.400
No idea.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.500
Tosh, do an analysis of the glove,
see you if you can find out.

09:33.535 --> 09:36.200
Owen, I don't need to tell you
that you're under quarantine.

09:36.235 --> 09:38.600
You don't, and yet you still do.

09:47.800 --> 09:48.565
Hey.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.000
Oh, I woke you up, I'm sorry.

09:50.035 --> 09:51.817
No, no, you didn't.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.565
<i>So, what's up?</i>

09:53.600 --> 09:54.965
You coming home soon?

09:55.000 --> 09:58.200
You know, tonight, next week,
in time for our wedding?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.800
I was only teasing!

10:03.200 --> 10:05.000
No, it's not that, it's not that.

10:05.035 --> 10:06.800
What's happened? What's wrong?

10:08.800 --> 10:11.800
Are you all right? Gwen?

10:12.600 --> 10:16.600
A tough day, a tough day.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.965
You're kinda cute when you frown.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.400
The energy from the glove
is spreading out through your body,

10:29.800 --> 10:31.565
changing its composition.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.000
If you keep this on we should be able
to monitor changes as they happen.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.000
You've stopped flirting with me.

10:37.035 --> 10:37.965
I mean, it's all right.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.800
I wouldn't flirt with me
in my condition either, but...

10:41.200 --> 10:43.800
is it still necrophilia
if I'm conscious?

10:43.835 --> 10:46.800
What was it like? To die?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.200
- I don't think I should say.
- Why not?

10:52.000 --> 10:55.800
I'm not sure the living should know.
The living...

10:57.200 --> 10:59.000
It might change the way
you live your life.

10:59.035 --> 11:01.365
You tell me right now, Owen.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.200
It's hard to describe,
there aren't the words for it.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.400
- It's like, er...
- What?

11:10.800 --> 11:14.165
There was a light,
a tiny speck of light.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.000
And I was rushing towards it,
like down a corridor,

11:17.400 --> 11:20.400
then it glowed
brighter and brighter...

11:21.800 --> 11:24.965
then suddenly there
were these gates...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.600
these big pearly gates
and there was this old geezer

11:27.800 --> 11:30.200
and he said you've been
a very naughty boy.

11:30.235 --> 11:31.800
Idiot!

11:33.600 --> 11:37.600
There was nothing,
well, not that I can remember.

11:37.635 --> 11:39.800
Suzie said it was different.

11:39.835 --> 11:40.565
What did she see?

11:40.600 --> 11:43.400
She said there was
something beyond life,

11:44.000 --> 11:49.000
something in the darkness,
something moving.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.400
Martha!

12:03.400 --> 12:06.000
Martha! Martha!

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Martha!

12:10.800 --> 12:12.600
Jack! Help! I need help! Now!

12:13.600 --> 12:14.165
What's happening?

12:14.200 --> 12:16.800
He just collapsed. Owen!
Owen, can you hear me?

12:16.835 --> 12:18.165
- Calm down.
- What happened?

12:18.200 --> 12:21.800
I was in the darkness, there was
something, something there...

12:22.800 --> 12:24.400
What did you see?

12:25.900 --> 12:27.300
I don't know.

12:28.100 --> 12:31.500
It was waiting for me.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.065
This way.

12:35.100 --> 12:37.900
Owen's body's undergoing
some kind of transformation.

12:37.935 --> 12:39.900
His cells aren't decaying,
they're changing.

12:39.935 --> 12:41.465
Into what?

12:41.500 --> 12:45.200
An energy I can't identify.
But it's growing, all the time.

12:45.235 --> 12:48.900
- He's about 40% something else.
- I don't feel any different.

12:48.935 --> 12:50.917
We need to find out where
this energy's coming from.

12:50.952 --> 12:53.326
Presumably it's the same
place as the glove, which,

12:53.361 --> 12:55.700
judging from its atomic makeup,
isn't anywhere local.

12:55.735 --> 12:58.065
Owen said he went somewhere
when he collapsed.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.600
Could the energy and the glove
come from the same dark place?

13:00.635 --> 13:03.100
Are we talking about another
dimension? Parallel universe?

13:03.135 --> 13:05.500
Yes, guys, I'm still here.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.100
Sorry.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.700
Okay, you said there was something
in the darkness, waiting for you.

13:12.100 --> 13:14.200
I felt it, I didn't see it.

13:14.235 --> 13:16.300
Where do you think you went?

13:17.900 --> 13:19.900
Don't know.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.265
<i>So, what now?</i>

13:24.300 --> 13:26.300
<i>lanto, check our internal
system readings for any</i>

13:26.335 --> 13:28.065
<i>dimensional anomalies
in the last hour.</i>

13:28.100 --> 13:33.500
Owen, what I said before,
when I thought you were dying-

13:33.535 --> 13:35.900
I'm not dying. I'm dead.
I'm a headless chicken.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.700
I just haven't stopped
running about yet.

13:37.735 --> 13:39.265
Well, when I told you I-

13:39.300 --> 13:42.300
Yeah, you didn't mean it. I know.

13:42.335 --> 13:43.665
You do?

13:43.700 --> 13:47.700
Yes, I mean, you didn't say
anything before

13:47.900 --> 13:49.700
and then suddenly I'm dying
and it's like, "I love you. "

13:49.735 --> 13:51.865
You know, that's not love, Tosh.
That's grief.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.300
You're losing something, so suddenly
you desperately desire it,

13:54.700 --> 13:56.465
textbook response.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.665
Yeah, but Owen I... don't go!

13:58.700 --> 14:02.900
I'm just going to the toilet,
all right? For crying out loud!

14:08.300 --> 14:10.100
<i>Melenkurion.</i>

14:13.900 --> 14:15.900
<i>Abatha.</i>

14:19.900 --> 14:21.900
<i>Duroc.</i>

14:23.300 --> 14:25.500
<i>Minas.</i>

14:26.500 --> 14:28.700
<i>Mill khabaal.</i>

14:43.100 --> 14:46.600
Melenkurion abatha...

14:46.635 --> 14:50.100
duroc minas mill khabaal!

15:04.900 --> 15:06.100
Have you seen Owen?

15:06.135 --> 15:07.265
He was with Toshiko.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.700
The energy in him
just went off the scale.

15:09.735 --> 15:12.665
Owen! Owen?

15:12.700 --> 15:13.865
He said he needed the loo.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.265
Owen's digestive system
is shut down.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.900
He can't eat or drink,
so he doesn't need to pee.

15:17.935 --> 15:18.665
He's not answering.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.800
Well, he's not in the hub.

15:19.835 --> 15:20.865
You mean he's out there?

15:20.900 --> 15:22.700
It's Owen, it's not like
he's dangerous.

15:22.735 --> 15:23.700
You sure about that?

15:23.735 --> 15:24.265
Meaning?

15:24.300 --> 15:28.100
You had the power to bring people back
to life and you never told UNIT. Why?

15:28.900 --> 15:29.900
They would've wanted to use it.

15:29.935 --> 15:31.300
I'm on your side, Jack,

15:31.500 --> 15:35.100
but Owen's just had a surge of energy
that we can't begin to understand.

15:35.135 --> 15:37.900
The cells in his body are being
transformed into something else.

15:37.935 --> 15:39.717
He's about 50% human.

15:39.752 --> 15:41.465
And that 50% is dead.

15:41.500 --> 15:44.100
We need to stop thinking
about him as Owen.

15:44.135 --> 15:45.900
I'll find him.

16:28.700 --> 16:31.700
Smile, it won't kill you.

16:37.300 --> 16:39.900
You're gorgeous, you are.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.900
- Don't you like me?
- Get off me.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.500
No blood, brilliant.

16:57.535 --> 16:59.500
<i>What? Oi!</i>

17:03.500 --> 17:04.900
How did you find me?

17:09.500 --> 17:11.099
Do you know what you've done?

17:11.135 --> 17:12.464
You don't care about me.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.099
You brought me back
for an alarm code!

17:16.099 --> 17:17.665
That is not why
I brought you back.

17:17.700 --> 17:21.900
Have you any idea what it means
to know that your life is over?

17:21.935 --> 17:24.065
<i>That that was it?!</i>

17:24.099 --> 17:28.500
That is Owen Harper's
contribution to the world.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.500
You idiot!

17:35.900 --> 17:37.500
Get off me!

17:38.100 --> 17:40.200
- Get off me!
- Be careful with him!

17:40.235 --> 17:42.300
Get off me
you meat head, get off!

17:44.900 --> 17:45.700
- That's enough.
- Let go of me!

17:45.735 --> 17:46.617
Let's calm down, shall we?

17:46.652 --> 17:47.465
Look, mate. I'm Torchwood.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.700
Yeah, course you are, and I'm MI5.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.900
I'm Owen Harper. I work for
Torchwood, I'm special ops.

17:54.935 --> 17:56.500
Special ops? What's he on about?

17:56.535 --> 17:58.500
Special needs more like it!

18:01.700 --> 18:03.700
Come on, that's enough!

18:14.500 --> 18:17.700
You call that number, you speak
to Police Constable Gwen Cooper!

18:17.735 --> 18:18.800
I want to make a complaint!

18:18.835 --> 18:22.200
Enough. You're dead.

18:22.400 --> 18:23.165
You break your ankle,

18:23.200 --> 18:25.400
what are the chances
it'll knit back together?

18:26.000 --> 18:30.400
You want to add a wheelchair
to your prob... problems?

18:36.200 --> 18:39.365
I forgot, my digestive system
is shut down,

18:39.400 --> 18:42.200
that alcohol I drank is just
going to sit in my stomach,

18:42.235 --> 18:43.565
it won't go anywhere.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.300
Can you just stick your fingers
down your throat?

18:46.335 --> 18:49.000
I'm dead, it's just
another one of those things,

18:49.400 --> 18:52.165
the gag reflex,
I lost in the process.

18:52.200 --> 18:59.200
Hang on, hang on, if I can just
line up my oesophagus...

19:06.200 --> 19:11.800
That is the single most disgusting thing
I have ever seen, and I know disgusting.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.200
Sorry, Jack, I forgot,
that goes on for a while after death.

19:19.235 --> 19:21.365
For God's sake, let me out!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.400
But eventually that will stop too.

19:23.435 --> 19:25.565
I will fart my last fart.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.800
God, I'm going to miss farting,
and sex.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.365
Sex more than farting, I hope.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.165
Oh, you take these things
for granted.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.400
It's only when they're slipping away
that you realise how amazing they are.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.800
or you know, feel these bricks
underneath my hands.

19:41.835 --> 19:44.000
"Only in suffering
do we recognize beauty. "

19:44.035 --> 19:45.400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah!
Who said that?

19:45.435 --> 19:46.365
Proust.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.600
- You've read Proust?
- Yeah.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.365
Well, no.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.200
We dated for a while.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.765
He was really immature.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.800
You know, none of us know
whether to take you seriously

19:56.835 --> 19:58.565
when you say those things.

19:58.600 --> 20:03.800
When you've lived as long as I have,
you don't make any more up.

20:04.200 --> 20:08.800
You've got forever,
I could have seconds.

20:08.835 --> 20:12.400
- Hardly seems fair.
- It isn't.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.000
But then forever's overrated.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.200
Not from where I'm sitting.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.400
If you've got forever, you don't
notice the flecks on the concrete

20:25.435 --> 20:28.200
or bother to touch the bricks.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.165
And you send your friends
into danger,

20:31.200 --> 20:32.565
knowing the stakes aren't
the same for you,

20:32.600 --> 20:38.600
that you might get them killed
while you walk away unscathed.

20:39.600 --> 20:42.600
Then why did you
bring me back? Guilt?

20:42.635 --> 20:45.965
No, that's not why.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.400
Then why did you, really?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
Because I wasn't ready
to give up on you.

20:56.035 --> 20:59.400
I guess I was hoping for a miracle.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.600
And I still am.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.600
Let's go home.

21:15.000 --> 21:20.400
Torchwood. Authorization,
Harkness, Jack. 474317.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.700
Jack called in, he's found Owen.

21:24.735 --> 21:26.765
They're okay, they're coming back.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.000
- Is he himself?
- What do you mean, himself?

21:30.035 --> 21:32.200
I wanted to know why Owen left.

21:32.600 --> 21:35.000
Well actually, more if he talked
to anyone about what I said,

21:35.200 --> 21:36.765
so I checked the CCTV.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.800
That's a bit like stalking, Tosh!

21:38.835 --> 21:40.365
I know!

21:40.400 --> 21:43.600
Only now I wish I hadn't. Look.

21:46.800 --> 21:54.200
<i>Melekurion abatha,
duroc minas mill khabaal.</i>

21:54.235 --> 21:56.400
Oh, my God.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.800
What is that?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.400
There's too many of them.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.600
They're after me, I stole
the glove from them. Go.

22:11.800 --> 22:12.600
Go!

22:19.600 --> 22:22.600
Whoa! They must be really
pissed off with you.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.200
Owen!

22:47.400 --> 22:49.600
Stay here.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.000
Owen!

23:56.800 --> 24:00.200
- Owen, get behind me.
- Yeah, right.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.600
Come on.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.700
Owen, what the hell
is going on?

24:31.735 --> 24:34.465
Melekurion abatha!

24:34.500 --> 24:38.700
Duroc minas mill khabaal!

24:41.500 --> 24:43.300
I need to know
what Owen was saying.

24:43.335 --> 24:45.100
We all do.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.500
This has never
let us down before.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.100
We should be able
to play the translation

24:50.300 --> 24:52.500
through the computer's speakers.

24:56.500 --> 24:58.900
It's never done that before.

25:00.900 --> 25:07.100
<i>I shall walk the Earth
and my hunger will know no bounds.</i>

25:07.135 --> 25:09.300
I've got a really bad feeling
about this.

25:09.335 --> 25:11.700
You don't know the half of it.

25:27.100 --> 25:32.300
So I'm King of the Weevils,
maybe even Weevil Messiah,

25:32.335 --> 25:37.100
but whichever way you
look at it, it ain't good.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.900
No, it isn't, and I think
it's happened before.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.265
Where did you get this?

25:43.300 --> 25:45.665
I found it in an article
about Black Death,

25:45.700 --> 25:49.100
and what you're looking at there is
the first images of the Grim Reaper.

25:49.135 --> 25:53.417
"I shall walk the Earth
and my hunger will know no bounds. "

25:53.452 --> 25:57.700
In legend, the person who said
those words was Death himself.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.800
But there's no such thing.

26:01.835 --> 26:04.500
Yeah, I'm dead. I'm not Death.

26:04.535 --> 26:06.817
There is a difference.

26:06.852 --> 26:09.100
Does he know that?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.700
Right, that wood-carving
dates back to the 15th century,

26:15.900 --> 26:18.700
to a small parish called St. James.

26:19.300 --> 26:23.300
When they heard about the plague,
they built a wall around the town.

26:23.335 --> 26:26.700
Unfortunately, that didn't
prevent a little girl from dying.

26:26.735 --> 26:30.465
SO the legend goes,
the priest performs a miracle,

26:30.500 --> 26:33.800
brings her back to life,
but she doesn't come back alone,

26:33.835 --> 26:36.767
she brought Death with her,
and he walked amongst them.

26:36.802 --> 26:39.700
Are we seriously gonna act
on something she's Googled?

26:39.735 --> 26:42.100
What was the name
of the priest's church?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.865
Yep, St. Mary's.

26:44.900 --> 26:48.500
That's where I found the glove,
which makes the parish of St. James-

26:48.535 --> 26:52.100
The town that 500 years later
would turn into a city called Cardiff.

26:52.135 --> 26:55.500
What happened to the town
when Death walked amongst them?

26:55.535 --> 26:58.465
People died. 12 people.

26:58.500 --> 27:02.100
Death needed 13 souls before it
had a permanent hold on the Earth.

27:02.135 --> 27:03.465
How did they stop it at 12?

27:03.500 --> 27:07.100
- It just says faith.
- Owen is changing.

27:07.135 --> 27:08.865
Who knows what that energy is?

27:08.900 --> 27:11.865
What if it's making him a host,
a gateway?

27:11.900 --> 27:13.700
I've been thinking there's
something in the darkness,

27:13.735 --> 27:15.065
waiting for me
to finally pass over,

27:15.100 --> 27:18.700
but I've got it wrong, okay,
it's the other way around.

27:18.735 --> 27:21.500
It's trying to get here
through me.

27:22.700 --> 27:23.700
What's this reading now?

27:25.100 --> 27:25.865
80%.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.065
What happens when it completes?

27:28.100 --> 27:29.700
You know, we fight monsters,
what happens when we

27:29.735 --> 27:31.465
turn out to be the monsters,
when I do?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.900
Even if we have to fight you,
you're already dead.

27:34.935 --> 27:37.017
What do we do with the dead?

27:37.052 --> 27:39.100
<i>Come on, what do we do?!</i>

27:39.135 --> 27:41.300
You embalm them.

27:42.500 --> 27:46.465
If we inject a formaldehyde
solution into my veins,

27:46.500 --> 27:49.900
it'll petrify my neural pathways
and freeze dry my brain.

27:50.300 --> 27:53.100
It's the only way to be sure.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.900
Are you sure about this?

28:21.100 --> 28:22.665
The formaldehyde might irritate,

28:22.700 --> 28:26.700
but the ethanol should
prevent me feeling its effect.

28:27.500 --> 28:32.500
It's a raging carcinogen, but I don't
think I need to worry about that.

28:34.300 --> 28:36.300
You know what I mean.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.100
Yeah.

28:39.900 --> 28:43.000
I can't sleep,
I can't drink and I can't shag,

28:43.035 --> 28:46.100
and they are three
of my favourite things.

28:46.135 --> 28:47.700
Owen!

28:52.500 --> 28:55.500
I'm not the same, Gwen.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.500
I came back different, hollow...

29:01.900 --> 29:04.500
like I'm missing something.

29:06.300 --> 29:10.900
And I do not
want to be like this, okay?

29:15.900 --> 29:18.500
I'm ready.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.565
Owen's at 95%.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.400
Then let's not waste
any more time.

30:51.435 --> 30:53.400
No goodbyes.

31:07.200 --> 31:09.200
Are you ready
for the first injection?

31:22.000 --> 31:24.800
Someone really
doesn't like needles.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.800
Lockdown!

31:31.200 --> 31:32.600
Martha just...

31:50.800 --> 31:53.600
Owen, Owen, don't move.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.000
Everyone spread out.

32:06.800 --> 32:07.965
Where'd it go?

32:08.000 --> 32:10.200
I think it went
under the cabinet.

32:10.235 --> 32:11.165
Are you all right?

32:11.200 --> 32:15.200
- Yeah, I think so.
- Good.

32:27.600 --> 32:28.800
<i>It's there.</i>

33:08.600 --> 33:09.165
Gun!

33:09.200 --> 33:12.000
If you destroy it,
the connection could be lost.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.800
Now!

33:31.400 --> 33:33.000
Oh, my God.

33:34.800 --> 33:35.800
Martha?

33:41.600 --> 33:43.200
Martha?

33:45.800 --> 33:47.200
What's happened to her?

33:47.235 --> 33:49.517
It's the glove.

33:49.552 --> 33:51.800
It did this to her.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.600
Owen, help me with her.

33:54.635 --> 33:56.000
<i>Owen!</i>

34:00.600 --> 34:03.565
I will walk the Earth

34:03.600 --> 34:09.400
and my hunger
will know no bounds.

34:42.199 --> 34:44.800
Police officer,
I need a medic now!

34:49.199 --> 34:51.600
Where did it go? Owen!

34:58.000 --> 35:00.100
So what happened to that thing?

35:00.135 --> 35:02.200
- It's gone.
- So it's out there?

35:06.200 --> 35:07.565
How do you know her?

35:07.600 --> 35:09.365
I take it you're not family.

35:09.400 --> 35:11.400
She's a neighbour,
we look in, do her shopping,

35:11.435 --> 35:13.400
collect her pension,
that sort of thing, you know?

35:14.400 --> 35:16.200
Her red blood cell count
is through the floor

35:16.400 --> 35:18.765
and she's massively dehydrated.

35:18.800 --> 35:22.800
All of which has placed
a considerable strain on her heart.

35:22.835 --> 35:24.600
- You've got to help her.
- We are,

35:25.000 --> 35:29.200
but you have to accept
she's, what, 80?

35:29.235 --> 35:31.765
Just do what you can, please.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.800
It must be Death,
because it's stolen my life.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.000
We'll find a way to reverse this.

35:40.600 --> 35:44.000
Last time, back when Cardiff
was a town, it killed 12 people.

35:44.035 --> 35:46.400
- So?
- Why didn't it get to 13?

35:46.600 --> 35:49.800
And where does this
faith bit come into it?

35:49.835 --> 35:52.165
- lanto, we need answers.
- I'm on it.

35:52.200 --> 35:54.465
Owen, I want you back
at the hub. You're not safe.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.900
Jack, I'm free of it, I promise you,
and I'm useful, I'm useful here.

35:57.935 --> 35:59.265
When it came though me,
I felt it.

35:59.300 --> 36:02.100
I know what it is,
I know what it wants, it's Duroc.

36:02.135 --> 36:04.700
- And what is that?
- Hunger.

36:05.100 --> 36:08.500
<i>How do we look for it it?
Where do we even start to look for it?</i>

36:09.900 --> 36:12.900
We won't have to go far.
It's here.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.100
<i>Why would it follow us here?</i>

36:17.135 --> 36:18.465
I'm not sure it did.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.900
Maybe it senses the near-dead.

36:21.100 --> 36:24.100
If you were Death,
wouldn't you target a hospital?

37:11.300 --> 37:12.465
This is captain Jack Harkness,
Torchwood.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.500
You need to evacuate St. Helen's
Hospital Cardiff immediately.

37:15.535 --> 37:17.100
Ladies and Gentlemen,
this is Torchwood.

37:17.300 --> 37:19.300
If you can move as quickly
and as safely as possible

37:19.500 --> 37:21.700
to your nearest exit,
thank you.

37:25.900 --> 37:29.500
Can I have a hand in here, please?
All right, wake up!

37:29.535 --> 37:31.300
Dressing gowns on!
It's not a drill.

37:31.500 --> 37:34.100
Can you listen to me
carefully, please?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.065
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not a drill.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.465
Please make your way to
the assembly point in car park one.

37:52.500 --> 37:56.100
lanto, I need you to crack into
the hospital communication system.

37:56.135 --> 37:59.700
Already done it. They've got multiple
Code 4's in intensive care.

37:59.735 --> 38:01.465
- Which floor is that?
- Six.

38:01.500 --> 38:03.065
- What's a Code 4?
- Heart attack.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.700
We need to do a body count,
let me know if we get to 12.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.700
- Have you seen Jamie?
- No.

38:11.735 --> 38:13.500
I'll catch you up.

38:29.300 --> 38:30.700
Jamie?

38:31.500 --> 38:33.700
Jamie, is that you under there?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.200
Owen, Tosh,
we're on the sixth floor.

38:42.235 --> 38:44.265
There's fatalities.
Seven of them.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.700
I'm hearing of a fatality
during a routine operation.

38:46.735 --> 38:48.817
Let's count that as eight.

38:48.852 --> 38:51.176
That leaves five to go. Oh.

38:51.211 --> 38:53.465
- What?
- There's five of us.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.065
If it was last seen on the sixth,
did it go up or down from there?

38:56.100 --> 38:59.500
Most of the top floors are evacuated,
so if it's still hungry, I'd guess-

38:59.535 --> 39:01.465
We'll make our way down.

39:01.500 --> 39:03.900
Jack, we still have no idea
what to do if we find it.

39:03.935 --> 39:04.865
lanto?

39:04.900 --> 39:05.900
I have searched for the phrase;

39:06.100 --> 39:08.300
"I shall walk the Earth
and my hunger will know bounds",

39:08.335 --> 39:11.317
but I keep getting redirected
to Weight Watchers!

39:11.352 --> 39:14.300
<i>It was a medical journal,
History Of Medicine.</i>

39:14.335 --> 39:17.300
Try under Tavistock or Wellcome.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.700
We're on the seventh floor.

39:20.700 --> 39:24.500
It's here, I can feel it.

39:25.900 --> 39:27.865
Owen, you're scaring me.

39:27.900 --> 39:31.100
I'm not exactly reassuring myself.
Come on.

40:41.700 --> 40:44.100
<i>Melenkurion abatha...</i>

40:45.300 --> 40:47.700
<i>duroc minas...</i>

40:48.300 --> 40:50.300
<i>mill khabaal.</i>

41:16.900 --> 41:20.100
Take my hand. Come on!

41:25.700 --> 41:27.800
- I'm getting reports of 12 people dead.
- So?

41:27.835 --> 41:29.900
The legend says,
when Death took 13 souls,

41:30.100 --> 41:31.665
its power would be unstoppable.

41:31.700 --> 41:34.500
It'd roam the Earth forever, Jack.
It only needs to kill once more.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.900
That's 12.
We're running out of time.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.900
I think we lost it.

41:40.300 --> 41:40.865
Maybe not.

41:40.900 --> 41:43.100
If I can access
the correct frequency...

41:43.135 --> 41:44.465
- What's your name?
- Jamie Burton.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.200
All right, Jamie.
I'm Owen, this is Toshiko,

41:46.235 --> 41:47.900
we're going to get you
out of here, mate.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.365
- What are you in here for?
- Leukaemia.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.600
Jamie, you're going to be fine.
I'll have this door open in a second.

41:54.635 --> 41:58.800
Jamie, they got you in for
a round of chemo, have they?

41:58.835 --> 42:01.200
Had that. It didn't work.

42:01.235 --> 42:02.565
So why are you here?

42:02.600 --> 42:04.400
They're trying to make me
have it again.

42:04.435 --> 42:05.165
It didn't work though.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.000
The cancer just comes back,
just makes my hair fall out.

42:09.035 --> 42:10.400
If I'm gonna die...

42:11.600 --> 42:13.800
I might aswell do it
with eyebrows.

42:13.835 --> 42:15.165
<i>lanto, what have we got?</i>

42:15.200 --> 42:19.000
Back in 1479, the priest discovered
that Death needed 13 souls

42:19.035 --> 42:22.800
- to walk the Earth for eternity.
- He stopped Death at 12.

42:22.835 --> 42:24.165
<i>- It was Faith.
- I know!</i>

42:24.200 --> 42:26.600
No, the little girl that died
and was brought back to life.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.600
<i>Her name was Faith.
She stopped it.</i>

42:28.800 --> 42:31.165
- Well, how?
- It doesn't say.

42:31.200 --> 42:33.600
Faith didn't have
anything to lose.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.800
She was already dead.

42:36.835 --> 42:38.400
Jamie.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.565
Jamie, you're scared,
of course you are.

42:41.600 --> 42:44.400
The last lot of chemo didn't work
and you can't bear the thought

42:44.435 --> 42:46.317
of going through
all that pain again,

42:46.352 --> 42:48.165
and I understand that, mate,
I really do,

42:48.200 --> 42:52.600
but let me tell you that not
everyone dies of this disease.

42:52.635 --> 42:54.717
And the ones with
the best chance of making it

42:54.752 --> 42:56.800
are the ones who believe
that they can beat Death.

42:56.835 --> 43:02.600
And sometimes,
just sometimes, you can.

43:03.000 --> 43:05.400
So watch and learn,
Jamie Burton.

43:05.435 --> 43:07.400
Watch what?

43:09.200 --> 43:12.400
Watch me beat Death.

43:13.400 --> 43:15.165
- Come on!
- Okay, go!

43:15.200 --> 43:18.400
Come on, Jamie.
Take him. Okay?

43:19.000 --> 43:24.200
Owen, I am not leaving you
to face that thing on your own.

43:24.235 --> 43:25.365
I know what to do.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.600
You don't know
what we're dealing with.

43:33.200 --> 43:35.800
You're so gonna hate me for this.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.800
Owen! Owen, no! Open the door!

43:41.835 --> 43:44.200
<i>What the hell are you doing?!</i>

43:44.235 --> 43:47.000
Owen, Owen!

43:53.800 --> 43:55.600
How long?!

43:57.000 --> 44:01.400
How long can you last
here with only 12 victims?

44:01.800 --> 44:04.765
There's nothing here for you!

44:04.800 --> 44:08.600
Owen Harper's soul
has left the building!

44:11.600 --> 44:15.000
There's nobody here
but us dead men.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.000
- No! Owen!
- Owen!

44:27.000 --> 44:29.600
What else have you got?

44:34.000 --> 44:37.200
What else can you do
to the dead?!

44:39.800 --> 44:43.200
Jack! Jack! Jack!

44:45.200 --> 44:47.800
Owen! Owen!

44:47.835 --> 44:49.200
Owen!

44:52.800 --> 44:55.200
Is that all you've got?!

44:55.800 --> 44:59.400
- Finish!
- Owen!

45:08.200 --> 45:09.800
No, no, no.

45:39.000 --> 45:40.800
<i>Jack?</i>

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
Jack?

45:43.400 --> 45:45.400
Gwen?

45:45.800 --> 45:47.400
Anyone?

45:58.600 --> 46:02.000
So tell me, Doctor, is it worth
starting War And Peace?

46:03.800 --> 46:06.200
I'm sorry that you got hurt.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.165
That I got you hurt.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.565
It's not me
that I'm worried about.

46:11.600 --> 46:17.000
You soaked up a colossal amount
of energy, but it's dissipating now.

46:17.035 --> 46:18.165
It doesn't sound good.

46:18.200 --> 46:21.000
I don't know anything about
its properties. None of us do.

46:21.035 --> 46:23.800
It could take 30 years
for it to die out completely.

46:23.835 --> 46:25.800
Or 30 minutes.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.200
Jack.

46:30.200 --> 46:33.600
People died because you
brought me back.

46:33.635 --> 46:36.800
We owe them, you and me.

46:37.200 --> 46:39.000
I'm still a doctor.

46:39.035 --> 46:40.765
Let's put me to work.

46:40.800 --> 46:43.800
See if we can't even that score.

46:44.800 --> 46:47.000
We'll see.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.365
Did he really beat Death?

46:54.400 --> 46:57.600
You can never really beat Death,
never escape it.

46:57.635 --> 46:59.800
It's always in
the shadows, waiting.

46:59.835 --> 47:02.000
So what do we do now?

47:13.200 --> 47:14.965
<i>My name is doctor Owen Harper.</i>

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
Torchwood officer 565,
I'm relieving you of your position.

47:18.035 --> 47:19.417
What's wrong with you?!

47:19.452 --> 47:20.800
<i>Three days ago, I died.</i>

47:21.000 --> 47:22.365
I'm broken, Tosh!

47:22.400 --> 47:23.700
<i>And they think I'm fine.</i>

47:23.735 --> 47:24.867
What the hell are you?

47:24.902 --> 47:25.965
<i>But they're wrong.</i>

47:26.000 --> 47:28.400
Parker's house. There's an
energy spike coming from there.

47:28.435 --> 47:29.400
And they're getting bigger.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.700
We need to get in there.

47:31.735 --> 47:32.800
But then there's these.

47:32.835 --> 47:34.600
Heat sensors.

47:35.000 --> 47:35.965
How do we get past them?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.600
<i>I'm literally
too cool for school.</i>

47:38.635 --> 47:39.965
You're Torchwood, yeah?

47:40.000 --> 47:42.600
And I'm having one hell of a day.
