01:03.605 --> 01:05.942
<i>Think of your
heart as the drums.</i>

01:08.978 --> 01:11.613
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

05:12.121 --> 05:14.622
Lisa!
Front bedroom.

05:20.329 --> 05:21.494
Hi.

05:21.496 --> 05:22.562
I'm Keith.

05:22.564 --> 05:25.201
Half an hour, 100.
An hour, 150.

05:26.035 --> 05:26.900
I just want to talk.

05:26.902 --> 05:28.804
Let's get the money
out of the way.

05:31.974 --> 05:32.975
Yeah.

05:54.529 --> 05:55.929
What's your name?

05:55.931 --> 05:57.530
Lisa.

05:57.532 --> 05:58.901
Is that your real name?

05:59.702 --> 06:01.237
My name's Lisa.

06:03.039 --> 06:05.708
Unless you want it to be
something else.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.912
- How about Stephanie?
- Sure.

06:19.388 --> 06:21.057
Stephanie Patrick?

06:25.094 --> 06:27.127
Your parents, they were on the
Northeastern Airlines flight

06:27.129 --> 06:30.464
that crashed,
into the Atlantic three years ago

06:30.466 --> 06:32.768
with your sister
and your brother.

06:33.502 --> 06:35.204
I'm a journalist.

06:38.774 --> 06:41.077
I'm writing an article.

06:43.012 --> 06:46.280
Look, it wasn't an accident.
There was a bomb onboard.

06:46.282 --> 06:47.950
Have you got
a cigarette?

06:49.985 --> 06:50.884
No.

06:50.886 --> 06:52.186
The bombmaker is here.
He's in London.

06:52.188 --> 06:54.790
He's free. He's walking
the fucking streets.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.331
I'll be back in a minute.

07:15.077 --> 07:17.411
Up. Come on.

07:17.413 --> 07:19.348
Get off me.
Get off me!

07:20.683 --> 07:23.285
I just want to talk,
Stephanie.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.190
- Go on. Get out, guv.
- All right, I'm going!

08:21.644 --> 08:24.346
<i>You have
one saved message.</i>

08:26.081 --> 08:28.582
<i>Hello, sweetheart.</i>

08:28.584 --> 08:32.152
<i>Uh, Dad left his wedding ring
on the counter.</i>

08:32.154 --> 08:33.255
<i>Can you grab it?</i>

08:34.390 --> 08:36.456
<i>See you at the airport.</i>

08:36.458 --> 08:38.292
<i>We love you.</i>

10:13.690 --> 10:15.024
What are you doing?

10:54.163 --> 10:57.232
- Can you prove it?
- Just get in.

11:06.075 --> 11:07.276
So where are we going?

11:08.610 --> 11:10.346
You can't have sex with me.

11:12.314 --> 11:13.382
That's a relief.

11:15.484 --> 11:16.550
Fuck you.

11:23.258 --> 11:24.526
Can you move?

11:41.443 --> 11:42.444
You want a drink?

11:46.081 --> 11:47.649
I'm gonna get a beer.

14:47.764 --> 14:49.897
Is that the man
who killed my family?

14:49.899 --> 14:51.264
That's Mohammed Reza.

14:51.266 --> 14:52.733
He made the device.

14:52.735 --> 14:54.634
- So he's a bombmaker.
- And the security services,

14:54.636 --> 14:56.202
they've got him
under surveillance,

14:56.204 --> 14:58.238
- but they won't bring him in.
- They know who made the bomb

14:58.240 --> 15:00.576
and they won't
fucking bring him in?

15:01.543 --> 15:02.578
No.

15:04.881 --> 15:07.147
- Well, why not?
- I'm not sure yet.

15:07.149 --> 15:09.850
Maybe they're worried
that if they do,

15:09.852 --> 15:11.518
they might
lose his network.

15:11.520 --> 15:14.120
Maybe they're also more scared
of who he might lead them to,

15:14.122 --> 15:16.222
maybe one of our friends
in the Middle East.

15:16.224 --> 15:19.060
Ramifications of that
could be huge.

15:19.062 --> 15:23.030
Can you imagine
if this stuff gets out?

15:23.032 --> 15:26.166
That they've let a known bomber
walk the streets of London?

15:26.168 --> 15:27.969
That all of this,
all this...

15:27.971 --> 15:29.636
The plane crash
was a cover-up?

15:35.477 --> 15:36.978
The fallout would be
catastrophic.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.748
How do you know all this?

15:39.749 --> 15:41.716
Research.
And my source.

15:41.718 --> 15:43.684
- And I'd prefer it...
- And you know your source...

15:43.686 --> 15:45.920
- ...if you don't smoke, please.
- ...is telling the truth?

15:45.922 --> 15:49.291
- How do you know?
- I'd prefer if you didn't smoke.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.637
How do you know your source
is telling the truth?

16:03.472 --> 16:05.574
He hasn't
steered me wrong yet.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.678
So this source,
what does he need you for?

16:10.680 --> 16:11.611
He can't do it himself.

16:11.613 --> 16:13.783
He's part of
the intelligence community.

16:14.917 --> 16:17.787
Ex-MI6, but he's still
an insider.

16:20.389 --> 16:22.157
And he needs you
to help him.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.258
Is that right?

16:25.260 --> 16:27.295
I can help you.

16:32.501 --> 16:34.436
You should have
left me alone.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.138
But I didn't, did I?

16:37.140 --> 16:38.875
'Cause I make
such a good headline.

16:39.641 --> 16:42.642
Some tragic,
middle-class student.

16:42.644 --> 16:44.177
I'm not that
kind of journalist.

16:44.179 --> 16:46.947
And I'm not here
to sell papers.

16:46.949 --> 16:48.749
You could have had
any life you wanted.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.017
This is the life I want.

16:50.019 --> 16:52.352
Instead of being the top
student at Oxford that you were?

16:52.354 --> 16:53.954
I don't believe you.

16:53.956 --> 16:55.657
Why did you come for me?

16:56.191 --> 16:58.326
You're another victim.

16:59.095 --> 17:00.863
You're just not dead yet.

17:08.470 --> 17:09.671
Who was Martin Douglas?

17:10.973 --> 17:13.373
The man in the seat
meant for me.

17:13.375 --> 17:14.842
He was an architect.

17:14.844 --> 17:16.879
From Uniondale, New York.

17:18.781 --> 17:21.984
- Was he married?
- Yeah. Yeah, he was.

17:22.885 --> 17:24.586
Did he have children?

17:25.587 --> 17:26.889
Two.

18:01.023 --> 18:02.859
B.

19:22.939 --> 19:25.875
- Who else knows about all this?
- No one.

19:27.442 --> 19:29.344
Well, what about
your source?

19:31.848 --> 19:32.849
B.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.617
Is that your source?

19:37.419 --> 19:39.519
What's B stand for?

19:39.521 --> 19:42.089
- Is B in Scotland?
- Leave it.

19:42.091 --> 19:43.556
What's his name?

19:43.558 --> 19:45.693
What's B stand for?

19:45.695 --> 19:47.895
It doesn't matter.
You'll never find him.

19:47.897 --> 19:51.499
I've got to go out.
I've got a meeting. So...

20:11.988 --> 20:15.557
That's if you need anything,
and there's some keys.

20:19.729 --> 20:22.062
I could disappear
and take your keys.

20:24.499 --> 20:25.902
And I could
change the locks.

21:10.512 --> 21:12.014
- That a new coat?
- No.

21:18.688 --> 21:21.223
What do you think,
I'm a fucking Travelex, Lis?

21:23.491 --> 21:25.491
What do you need,
one or two?

21:25.493 --> 21:26.829
And a gun.

21:30.333 --> 21:34.134
You? A shooter?

21:34.136 --> 21:35.838
Do me a fucking favor, Lis.

21:36.739 --> 21:38.174
I'll just find someone else.

23:04.060 --> 23:05.593
Can I help you?

23:32.488 --> 23:33.689
The bag.

23:38.427 --> 23:40.062
Where's my bag?

26:38.207 --> 26:39.208
Stop!

26:41.711 --> 26:43.777
Hey. I need to go that way.

26:43.779 --> 26:45.612
Sorry,
we're going into the town.

26:45.614 --> 26:47.383
You'll just have to
make your own way.

28:32.888 --> 28:34.890
Get the fuck off me!

28:38.728 --> 28:39.928
Get the...

28:45.702 --> 28:47.336
Let go of me!

28:49.605 --> 28:50.606
Stop!

29:00.082 --> 29:01.350
Take off your coat.

29:03.118 --> 29:04.618
Take off your coat!

29:12.060 --> 29:13.429
Empty the pockets.

29:20.936 --> 29:22.870
- How long since your last hit?
- I'm not an addict.

29:22.872 --> 29:24.671
- You're not an addict?
- I'm a user.

29:24.673 --> 29:26.339
- This for me?
- No.

29:26.341 --> 29:28.341
Huh? Is this for me?

29:28.343 --> 29:29.811
You'd have to get
very close.

29:29.813 --> 29:31.480
Close enough
to hit me with it.

29:34.349 --> 29:35.551
It's not loaded.

29:41.356 --> 29:42.357
Wait!

30:05.047 --> 30:07.414
Stephanie.
That's your name, isn't it?

30:07.416 --> 30:10.183
- Hmm.
- That's right.

30:10.185 --> 30:11.688
Your parents would be proud.

30:12.621 --> 30:14.020
Who else knows you're here?

30:14.022 --> 30:16.358
- My parents are dead.
- I know.

30:17.861 --> 30:20.393
Who else knows you're here?

30:20.395 --> 30:22.498
- No one.
- I can't hear you.

30:24.767 --> 30:26.099
No one.

30:26.101 --> 30:29.571
No one knows. No one knows.
No one knows I'm here.

30:30.707 --> 30:32.107
No one knows.

30:35.277 --> 30:36.713
Why did you come here, then?

30:40.015 --> 30:42.683
- I'm gonna kill Reza.
- Oh, God.

30:42.685 --> 30:44.620
He must be terrified.

30:45.855 --> 30:47.454
Help me find him.

30:47.456 --> 30:50.223
You want to kill Mohammed Reza,
you need to hire a professional.

30:50.225 --> 30:51.826
I don't have any money.

30:51.828 --> 30:54.194
Oh.
Well, you have a job.

30:54.196 --> 30:55.597
You're a prostitute,
aren't you?

31:00.502 --> 31:02.003
You're...

31:02.005 --> 31:04.739
You're B.
You're Proctor's source.

31:04.741 --> 31:06.809
Sorry?

31:10.145 --> 31:12.180
I could go to a newspaper

31:12.916 --> 31:14.815
and they would...

31:14.817 --> 31:18.318
They would want to hear about
you and Proctor, I'm sure.

31:18.320 --> 31:21.354
They'd want to hear
about you for...

31:21.356 --> 31:23.826
Was that the same Proctor
you managed to get killed?

31:33.068 --> 31:35.304
You might as well
have shot him yourself.

31:39.141 --> 31:40.342
Look at me.

31:41.911 --> 31:43.512
Look at me!

31:48.183 --> 31:50.417
You don't have a clue

31:50.419 --> 31:54.389
about the scale of the mess
you've caused.

32:11.808 --> 32:13.208
No!

32:44.573 --> 32:47.576
Where is Reza?
Help me find him.

32:50.212 --> 32:52.278
Why would I do that?

32:52.280 --> 32:55.116
You spooked Reza
with your cafeteria stunt.

32:55.118 --> 32:56.416
Thanks to you,
he's vanished.

32:56.418 --> 32:58.686
- I need to kill him.
- You can't even walk.

32:58.688 --> 33:00.155
Then help me walk.

33:30.787 --> 33:31.788
Laces.

33:39.227 --> 33:40.562
Fuck you.

33:57.212 --> 33:59.714
One second. One second.

33:59.716 --> 34:01.648
Just one second, please.

34:14.529 --> 34:16.931
<i>I'm gonna say this now,</i>
<i>so you never turn around to me</i>

34:16.933 --> 34:18.565
<i>and say I didn't warn you.</i>

34:18.567 --> 34:20.467
<i>You're not made for this.</i>

34:20.469 --> 34:22.203
Can we talk about Reza?

34:22.205 --> 34:23.940
<i>You're wasting your time.</i>

34:26.843 --> 34:27.942
Hey.

34:27.944 --> 34:30.376
<i>I can get you fit.</i>
<i>I can teach you survival.</i>

34:30.378 --> 34:32.847
<i>But in the end,
you'll still be you.</i>

34:35.517 --> 34:37.184
<i>It'll take longer
than you want.</i>

34:37.186 --> 34:39.220
<i>It'll hurt
more than you think.</i>

34:39.222 --> 34:41.256
Can we talk about Reza?

34:42.557 --> 34:44.225
<i>Almost certainly,</i>
<i>you won't succeed.</i>

34:44.227 --> 34:46.026
<i>But if by some miracle
you do succeed,</i>

34:46.028 --> 34:47.730
<i>this is what you'll discover:</i>

34:49.098 --> 34:50.767
<i>It's not worth it.</i>

34:51.600 --> 34:52.802
Come on.

34:53.301 --> 34:55.035
Just stop it.

34:55.037 --> 34:56.436
- Give me a minute!
- Oy.

34:56.438 --> 34:58.908
Don't treat me like
I'm fucking worthless.

35:01.177 --> 35:02.777
All right,
take off your clothes.

35:02.779 --> 35:04.646
- Fuck off.
- Take off your clothes.

35:09.719 --> 35:12.787
You won't run?
You can swim. Swim home.

35:12.789 --> 35:16.558
I can't... I can't swim.
It's fucking freezing.

35:17.727 --> 35:20.027
I mean it, I can't swim.
I'll fucking drown.

35:20.029 --> 35:21.394
Is there anything
you can do?

35:21.396 --> 35:22.999
You don't even know
what I've been through.

35:26.169 --> 35:29.437
Drugs. Prostitution.
That's not a tragedy.

35:30.173 --> 35:31.671
It's a cliche.

35:31.673 --> 35:34.811
You're a cliche.
You don't have what it takes.

35:35.878 --> 35:36.879
So drown.

35:38.014 --> 35:39.414
Or quit.

35:40.783 --> 35:41.918
I don't care.

38:44.499 --> 38:47.669
I've got nothing to lose,
so fucking try me.

38:51.474 --> 38:53.843
- What about your life?
- What about it?

39:44.260 --> 39:47.229
My family weren't
supposed to be on that flight.

39:52.667 --> 39:55.004
They changed their plans
so I could join them.

39:56.705 --> 39:58.207
But I didn't.

40:01.544 --> 40:03.611
Not because I couldn't.
Because I...

40:04.380 --> 40:06.048
Because I didn't want to.

40:10.585 --> 40:12.721
So they flew without me.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.036
All right.

40:28.737 --> 40:31.140
Reza is an errand boy.

40:33.943 --> 40:36.577
The man who greenlit
the attack on that plane

40:36.579 --> 40:38.378
was a radical Islamist cleric

40:38.380 --> 40:40.349
representing
a hardline government.

40:41.851 --> 40:45.888
And he paid U17
to get the job done.

40:47.556 --> 40:49.490
- What's U17?
- "Who," not "what."

40:49.492 --> 40:52.593
U17 is code
for an unidentified person.

40:52.595 --> 40:55.362
CIA classification
for a terrorist suspect

40:55.364 --> 40:57.833
with no confirmed root name.

40:58.434 --> 41:00.601
U17 could be anybody.

41:00.603 --> 41:02.736
And what about the cleric?
Where's he?

41:02.738 --> 41:05.806
Cleric was killed in a drone
strike two years ago.

41:05.808 --> 41:08.711
Reza is our direct link
to U17.

41:12.681 --> 41:16.886
You want Reza,
you're gonna want U17, too.

41:18.487 --> 41:19.889
I want 'em all.

41:22.258 --> 41:24.126
So this is Abdul Kaif.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.594
He was an activist.
A visionary.

41:27.596 --> 41:28.996
I read about him
at Proctor's.

41:28.998 --> 41:31.865
Considered a massive threat
because he was a reformer,

41:31.867 --> 41:34.201
from a region
terrified of reform.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.803
They killed 239 people
just to get to a man

41:36.805 --> 41:38.105
they could have shot
coming out of Harrods?

41:38.107 --> 41:41.408
It was a message specifically
addressed to reformers:

41:41.410 --> 41:42.943
We can get you anywhere

41:42.945 --> 41:46.182
and there is nothing
we are not prepared to do.

41:49.418 --> 41:52.019
Abdul died
fighting intolerance

41:52.021 --> 41:53.720
and extremism.

41:53.722 --> 41:57.393
Everyone else was
collateral damage.

42:00.062 --> 42:03.997
Abdul's father, Suleman Kaif,
suspected as much.

42:03.999 --> 42:06.934
He wasn't afraid to find out
who was behind this.

42:06.936 --> 42:09.405
He financed Proctor.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.383
Stop.

42:22.218 --> 42:24.051
<i>You got to get
your breathing sorted.</i>

42:24.053 --> 42:27.988
Don't panic.
Be calm. Be still.

42:27.990 --> 42:30.023
<i>You got to get your
rhythm section under control,</i>

42:30.025 --> 42:32.125
<i>like in music, remember?</i>

42:32.127 --> 42:34.628
Think of your heart
as the drums.

42:34.630 --> 42:36.897
- Yeah.
- Your breathing as the bass.

42:36.899 --> 42:39.068
<i>You get those sorted
and you're sorted.</i>

42:46.609 --> 42:48.875
<i>Your heart as the drums.</i>

42:48.877 --> 42:51.144
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

42:55.851 --> 42:58.153
Put another one in.
Never less than two.

43:05.294 --> 43:07.194
Good.

43:07.196 --> 43:09.531
- That's the easy part.
- What's the hard part?

43:10.933 --> 43:12.134
Living with it.

43:27.249 --> 43:29.251
<i>You're gonna</i>
<i>have to be someone else.</i>

43:29.652 --> 43:30.817
<i>Petra.</i>

43:30.819 --> 43:33.086
- Petra Reuter.
- Who's that?

43:33.088 --> 43:35.422
- She was an assassin.
- Was?

43:35.424 --> 43:37.359
- She's dead.
- Well, how's that gonna work?

43:39.161 --> 43:42.398
Her body was never recovered,
so it's gonna work great.

43:56.178 --> 43:57.479
Christ.

43:58.547 --> 44:00.414
What the...

44:03.720 --> 44:05.287
Fuck off.

44:21.236 --> 44:23.305
You've fucked the car
and now you're dead.

44:24.573 --> 44:26.375
You're fucking crazy.

44:29.445 --> 44:30.546
Nice job.

44:31.580 --> 44:33.215
Enjoy the walk home!

44:43.892 --> 44:45.627
Enjoy the walk home!

45:02.544 --> 45:03.610
Is this your wife?

45:03.612 --> 45:04.880
Uh-huh.

45:05.881 --> 45:08.417
- She's beautiful.
- Yeah, she was.

45:16.191 --> 45:18.127
When are you gonna
teach me to fight?

45:22.197 --> 45:24.299
We should probably
go over that, no?

45:28.404 --> 45:31.204
Find something sharp.
Go for ears, eyes.

45:31.206 --> 45:33.308
If they've got balls,
go for those.

45:38.882 --> 45:40.082
That's it?

45:41.316 --> 45:45.287
We need to concentrate on
the abilities that you have.

45:46.422 --> 45:48.023
Like languages.

45:54.563 --> 45:56.098
This because
I'm a woman?

45:57.266 --> 45:59.901
There are plenty of women
out there just as good as men.

45:59.903 --> 46:01.470
So, make me one of them.

46:02.872 --> 46:05.007
- It would take too long.
- How long?

46:07.242 --> 46:08.277
How long?

46:09.011 --> 46:10.379
It's been months.

46:12.581 --> 46:13.881
I said, how long?

46:13.883 --> 46:16.452
Your menopause would be
a distant memory.

46:50.920 --> 46:52.120
Fuck.

46:57.993 --> 46:59.194
Stop it.

47:01.263 --> 47:02.329
No.

47:13.710 --> 47:15.010
Go ahead.

48:23.211 --> 48:24.344
Calm yourself.

48:24.346 --> 48:25.947
Calm yourself.

48:27.649 --> 48:28.751
Stop moving.

48:35.190 --> 48:36.323
That's a good start.

48:49.571 --> 48:50.707
Want some tea?

48:52.976 --> 48:54.176
Hey.

48:55.078 --> 48:56.578
Are you MI6?

48:57.880 --> 48:59.348
Proctor said you were.

48:59.849 --> 49:00.850
Not at the moment.

49:01.617 --> 49:02.950
What does that mean?

49:02.952 --> 49:05.452
That means I messed up.

49:05.454 --> 49:06.455
How?

49:07.090 --> 49:08.791
I killed Petra Reuter.

49:09.692 --> 49:10.893
Deliberately?

49:13.562 --> 49:14.563
Yeah.

49:15.597 --> 49:17.566
I didn't kill her
by accident.

49:23.639 --> 49:24.874
That's Petra.

49:25.474 --> 49:26.573
How old would she be now?

49:26.575 --> 49:28.510
Older than you,
but manageable.

49:29.979 --> 49:31.914
Those three men
she's with there...

49:33.683 --> 49:35.350
She killed all of them.

49:39.789 --> 49:43.158
This is the nine-millimeter
hollow-point.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.225
<i>When that impacts soft tissue,</i>

49:45.227 --> 49:46.929
it flowers up to about
three times the size.

49:48.031 --> 49:50.263
Creates a larger
wound channel,

49:50.265 --> 49:52.700
severing arteries,
cutting nerves.

49:52.702 --> 49:55.468
Massive blood loss,
hypovolemic shock.

49:55.470 --> 49:58.072
You hit someone
in the sternum with that,

49:58.074 --> 50:01.142
the bone shatters,
bullet enters the heart...

50:01.144 --> 50:02.208
The heart blows out.

50:02.210 --> 50:04.812
- Shoot me.
- What?

50:04.814 --> 50:07.014
- Right here.
- Are you out of your mind?

50:07.016 --> 50:08.650
Shut up. Just do it.

50:28.570 --> 50:31.271
<i>Think of your heart</i>
<i>as the drums.</i>

50:31.273 --> 50:33.776
<i>Your breathing as the bass.</i>

50:38.480 --> 50:39.880
<i>Massive blood loss...
Clean through the body...</i>

50:39.882 --> 50:42.549
<i>Hypovolemic shock...
When that impacts soft tissue,</i>

50:42.551 --> 50:44.250
<i>it flowers up to about
three times the size.</i>

50:44.252 --> 50:45.922
<i>You hit someone
in the sternum with that...</i>

50:47.355 --> 50:50.559
<i>...the bone shatters,
bullet enters the heart...</i>

50:51.794 --> 50:52.995
<i>...the heart blows out.</i>

50:57.299 --> 50:58.968
I'm putting you
out in the field.

51:07.409 --> 51:09.677
<i>I received
counterintelligence information</i>

51:09.679 --> 51:12.980
<i>that Reza's making
a new device for U17.</i>

51:12.982 --> 51:15.381
Word is
it'll be a major event.

51:15.383 --> 51:17.517
So you're going to Madrid.

51:17.519 --> 51:20.255
It's where Marc Serra lives.

51:23.793 --> 51:27.293
That's Serra.
He's an information broker.

51:27.295 --> 51:28.361
Used to work for the CIA,

51:28.363 --> 51:29.629
now he trades
on the open market.

51:29.631 --> 51:32.700
We use Serra to get to U17.

51:32.702 --> 51:35.035
You're gonna have
to get close to Serra

51:35.037 --> 51:36.939
to convince him
you're Petra.

51:41.244 --> 51:43.445
- Who's gonna pay for all this?
- Fucked if I know.

51:47.150 --> 51:48.483
You serious?

51:50.987 --> 51:52.318
What about Abdul's father?

51:52.320 --> 51:54.320
Suleman Kaif.
He financed Proctor.

51:54.322 --> 51:56.857
- Good idea.
- Yeah, it is.

51:56.859 --> 51:58.694
Go get us some money.

52:34.563 --> 52:36.398
How did you get in here?

52:39.434 --> 52:41.235
Far too easily.

52:41.237 --> 52:42.437
What do you want?

52:43.572 --> 52:46.273
- What do you want?
- Your son was on flight 147.

52:46.275 --> 52:47.540
Get out of my house.

52:47.542 --> 52:50.044
You tried to prove
that the crash was terrorism,

52:50.046 --> 52:50.978
not mechanical failure,

52:50.980 --> 52:53.346
but no one believed you
except Proctor.

52:53.348 --> 52:54.917
- You know Proctor?
- Yes.

52:57.153 --> 53:00.388
If you want to talk to me,
get that gun out of my face.

53:10.800 --> 53:13.968
Proctor promised to find out
the truth for me.

53:13.970 --> 53:17.537
Instead, he stole my money
and disappeared.

53:17.539 --> 53:19.505
- He's a fraud.
- No.

53:19.507 --> 53:21.342
- He's a thief.
- No.

53:21.344 --> 53:22.678
He's dead.

53:23.312 --> 53:24.613
He was murdered.

53:26.048 --> 53:27.582
So why are you here?

53:28.583 --> 53:30.518
To offer you closure.

53:31.187 --> 53:32.822
And how would you do that?

53:34.123 --> 53:35.490
Violently.

53:37.793 --> 53:41.527
And, uh, what do you
want me to do exactly?

53:41.529 --> 53:44.798
Just...
Just expenses, that's all.

53:44.800 --> 53:45.968
Just expenses.

53:48.704 --> 53:51.007
- That's all.
- That's all.

53:52.808 --> 53:53.809
How did I guess?

53:56.245 --> 53:58.446
Please, leave my house.

53:59.849 --> 54:00.883
No.

54:08.824 --> 54:10.492
On the inside.

54:12.695 --> 54:14.529
My family's seat numbers.

54:27.843 --> 54:31.679
People have gone to far greater
lengths than this to cheat me.

54:31.681 --> 54:34.516
- I'm not cheating you.
- I don't know who you are,

54:35.151 --> 54:36.350
but I'll find out.

54:36.352 --> 54:40.387
Now, please leave my house.

54:40.389 --> 54:42.122
How do you know
Proctor was murdered?

54:42.124 --> 54:45.025
- Ah, she is leaving.
- Because I found him.

54:45.027 --> 54:46.961
It was my fault.

54:46.963 --> 54:48.696
He was the first person
in three years

54:48.698 --> 54:50.097
to treat me
like a human being.

54:50.099 --> 54:52.068
- Come on, get out.
- He wasn't a fraud.

55:00.009 --> 55:01.075
You've made a mistake.

55:01.077 --> 55:03.713
Alia, leave it.
This doesn't concern you.

55:04.814 --> 55:09.316
My son is dead.
And it doesn't concern me?

55:09.318 --> 55:10.718
You know
as well as I do

55:10.720 --> 55:12.753
that it is far more
complicated than that.

55:12.755 --> 55:14.288
She has no idea
what's she's talking about.

55:14.290 --> 55:16.624
- But I do.
- Alia, be quiet.

55:17.360 --> 55:19.492
I will not be silenced.

55:19.494 --> 55:21.496
You stay silent
if you want to.

55:22.898 --> 55:25.366
You were right about the
flight and you know it.

55:25.368 --> 55:27.236
Proctor showed me everything.

55:28.904 --> 55:30.603
Whoever did it,
I'll find them

55:30.605 --> 55:32.139
and I'll kill
every last one of them.

55:32.141 --> 55:34.008
I can do it. I will.

55:34.010 --> 55:36.644
But there will be
no public vindication for you.

55:38.014 --> 55:40.481
Killing the guilty
will not heal us.

55:40.483 --> 55:42.251
I'm not looking
to get healed.

55:44.487 --> 55:48.090
I will help you.
I will give you the money.

55:49.825 --> 55:50.860
Here.

55:51.559 --> 55:52.895
Your ring.

55:55.663 --> 55:57.900
No, no. Keep it.

55:59.201 --> 56:00.635
Keep it for me.

57:03.899 --> 57:06.233
<i>Got your
first contract for you.</i>

57:06.235 --> 57:09.870
<i>Name of Lehmans.
He's a piece of shit, this guy.</i>

57:09.872 --> 57:13.207
<i>Deals in arms, guns,
drugs, blood diamonds.</i>

57:13.209 --> 57:16.278
<i>If anyone can find him,
it's Serra.</i>

57:21.117 --> 57:22.850
<i>Why do I
have to kill him?</i>

57:22.852 --> 57:25.919
<i>Lehmans is the one</i>
<i>who led me to Petra.</i>

57:25.921 --> 57:28.889
<i>And she wasn't
the forgiving type.</i>

57:28.891 --> 57:31.225
<i>There's something else
you should know.</i>

57:31.227 --> 57:34.230
<i>He arranged for the bomb
to be on that plane.</i>

57:45.774 --> 57:47.574
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Hello, Marc?

57:47.576 --> 57:48.641
<i>Who is this?</i>

57:48.643 --> 57:50.379
I need you to find
Eric Lehmans for me.

57:51.447 --> 57:53.614
<i>Eric Lehmans, huh?</i>

57:53.616 --> 57:55.249
<i>Never heard of him.</i>

57:55.251 --> 57:58.886
What about Petra Reuter?
You heard of her?

57:58.888 --> 58:01.622
<i>Uh, now I'm definitely
not interested.</i>

58:01.624 --> 58:02.689
<i>But I'll tell you something.</i>

58:02.691 --> 58:04.525
<i>You can have
this one for free.</i>

58:04.527 --> 58:06.729
<i>Petra Reuter is dead.</i>

58:07.329 --> 58:08.998
I get that a lot.

58:09.899 --> 58:12.067
<i>Whoever you are,
you're not her.</i>

58:12.835 --> 58:15.068
Can you find him or not?

58:15.070 --> 58:16.071
<i>Let me...</i>

58:16.872 --> 58:18.305
<i>Let me think about it.</i>

58:18.307 --> 58:20.776
Sure. Why don't you call me
when you finish your espresso.

58:23.979 --> 58:25.981
<i>Why are you
looking for Lehmans?</i>

58:27.449 --> 58:28.515
What?

58:28.517 --> 58:30.252
<i>Why are you
looking for Lehmans?</i>

58:31.220 --> 58:32.186
Never mind.

58:32.188 --> 58:34.421
If you don't know why,
I'm wasting my time.

58:34.423 --> 58:35.824
<i>Hold on a sec.</i>

58:37.026 --> 58:39.895
- How much?
- <i>How much what?</i>

58:40.896 --> 58:43.530
- How much will it cost?
- <i>I'll let you know.</i>

58:43.532 --> 58:45.632
- Call me on this number.
- <i>No.</i>

58:45.634 --> 58:47.834
<i>We'll meet tomorrow.
Face to face.</i>

58:47.836 --> 58:50.306
- Okay, where?
- <i>I'll text you.</i>

59:24.807 --> 59:26.909
Always figured you
for a blonde.

59:28.744 --> 59:30.079
Did you find him or not?

59:30.913 --> 59:33.148
The fee is 200,000 euros.

59:34.684 --> 59:36.016
It includes a risk premium.

59:36.018 --> 59:37.317
You must have
a low opinion of me.

59:37.319 --> 59:39.453
I don't have
any opinion of you yet.

59:39.455 --> 59:41.323
Payable by wire, no cash.

59:44.293 --> 59:45.294
That works for me.

59:53.235 --> 59:56.003
Lehmans has an air-transport
company based in Belgrade,

59:56.005 --> 59:57.804
but he keeps his distance.

59:57.806 --> 59:59.840
He's changed his name
and lives alone

59:59.842 --> 1:00:03.176
in Tangier, in his apartment
and rarely goes out.

1:00:03.178 --> 1:00:04.544
Have fun.

1:01:17.353 --> 1:01:18.954
Who sent you?

1:01:24.526 --> 1:01:26.862
Your outline's unclear to me.

1:01:29.932 --> 1:01:32.065
Ah.

1:01:32.067 --> 1:01:34.303
But you smell like a woman.

1:01:36.505 --> 1:01:38.207
It's Petra Reuter.

1:01:53.188 --> 1:01:54.822
If it was,
I'd be dead already.

1:01:54.824 --> 1:01:56.189
You are.

1:01:56.191 --> 1:01:59.395
Petra had a reason to kill me.
What's yours?

1:02:00.462 --> 1:02:01.463
Stay.

1:02:02.998 --> 1:02:04.366
Three years ago.

1:02:04.666 --> 1:02:06.135
Ah...

1:02:08.570 --> 1:02:10.239
Flight 147.

1:03:02.692 --> 1:03:04.426
No, get off me!

1:05:45.822 --> 1:05:46.823
Hey.

1:05:48.323 --> 1:05:49.324
Hey.

1:05:50.492 --> 1:05:51.593
Hey, you!

1:05:54.630 --> 1:05:55.631
Whoa.

1:05:56.431 --> 1:05:57.432
Back up!

1:05:59.134 --> 1:06:00.335
Get the fuck back.

1:06:01.570 --> 1:06:03.169
Fairuz!

1:06:03.171 --> 1:06:05.840
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!

1:06:05.842 --> 1:06:08.377
<i>A genoux! A genoux!</i>

1:06:10.713 --> 1:06:11.848
Hey!

1:06:12.547 --> 1:06:13.548
Hey!

1:06:38.107 --> 1:06:39.408
Go!

1:06:40.375 --> 1:06:41.541
Fuck.

1:06:41.543 --> 1:06:43.478
Go!

1:06:47.016 --> 1:06:48.885
Move! Fucking get out!

1:07:50.780 --> 1:07:52.347
No. Fuck!

1:08:00.123 --> 1:08:01.654
Shit. Shit. Shit!

1:08:16.638 --> 1:08:17.639
Fuck!

1:09:21.237 --> 1:09:23.904
You really left your mark
on Tangier.

1:09:23.906 --> 1:09:25.773
You never told me
about his protection.

1:09:25.775 --> 1:09:28.876
Lehmans made too many
enemies not to have 'em.

1:09:28.878 --> 1:09:31.681
I'm surprised you didn't
know that... Petra.

1:09:32.849 --> 1:09:35.348
- I got a proposition for you.
- What?

1:09:35.350 --> 1:09:37.718
An American financier
named Leon Giler.

1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:41.088
He's being investigated
by the authorities in the US.

1:09:41.090 --> 1:09:44.091
My client's concerned he may
be tempted to cut a deal,

1:09:44.093 --> 1:09:46.526
save his own skin.

1:09:46.528 --> 1:09:48.494
Why is he being investigated?

1:09:48.496 --> 1:09:51.198
He got greedy with
other people's money.

1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:53.035
And it's time-sensitive,
I'm afraid.

1:09:55.004 --> 1:09:57.137
If you need more time
to think about it,

1:09:57.139 --> 1:09:58.471
we can meet up again later.

1:09:58.473 --> 1:09:59.775
If you're around.

1:10:00.776 --> 1:10:02.712
Strictly business,
of course.

1:10:10.418 --> 1:10:12.054
What else would it be?

1:10:20.696 --> 1:10:22.096
<i>What's up?</i>

1:10:22.098 --> 1:10:23.563
It's Serra,
he wants me to take a contract.

1:10:23.565 --> 1:10:26.867
Some businessman in New York
named Leon Giler?

1:10:26.869 --> 1:10:28.135
<i>Take the contract.</i>

1:10:28.137 --> 1:10:31.238
<i>Giler is suspected of having
financial dealings with U17.</i>

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:35.475
<i>It's believed he funded the cell
that brought down the plane.</i>

1:10:35.477 --> 1:10:37.711
<i>One more thing. Serra.</i>

1:10:37.713 --> 1:10:40.014
<i>When it comes to the money,
make it hurt.</i>

1:10:40.016 --> 1:10:41.882
<i>Petra always did.</i>

1:10:44.754 --> 1:10:46.552
I'll do it
for two million cash.

1:10:46.554 --> 1:10:48.456
- You're shitting me.
- No.

1:10:50.393 --> 1:10:51.859
I imagine
for whatever problem

1:10:51.861 --> 1:10:53.827
your client has with Giler,
that's gonna feel cheap.

1:10:53.829 --> 1:10:58.598
And then I still owe you 200,000
for finding me Lehmans, so...

1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:00.566
It's really only
1.8 plus expenses.

1:11:00.568 --> 1:11:02.535
That's not reasonable at all.

1:11:02.537 --> 1:11:05.473
Well, this isn't a
reasonable business, is it?

1:11:10.179 --> 1:11:13.646
So where exactly have you been
for the past few years?

1:11:13.648 --> 1:11:15.885
You're the information
broker, Marc.

1:11:23.525 --> 1:11:25.826
- What?
- I don't know.

1:11:25.828 --> 1:11:28.064
You're much more human than
I thought you'd be, Petra.

1:11:28.698 --> 1:11:30.199
Then it's a good disguise.

1:11:31.133 --> 1:11:33.067
Yes, it is.

1:11:33.069 --> 1:11:37.438
So, what's your story?
You're from Munich, right?

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.605
I think you know
I'm from Berlin.

1:11:39.607 --> 1:11:41.909
Ah, Berlin,
that's right. My bad.

1:11:41.911 --> 1:11:44.747
It's just you don't speak with
a trace of a German accent.

1:11:47.283 --> 1:11:50.384
- How long have you lived here?
- About six years now.

1:11:50.386 --> 1:11:51.921
Since you left the CIA?

1:11:56.491 --> 1:11:58.459
You know,
there's a lot of people

1:11:58.461 --> 1:11:59.994
that think that you're dead,

1:11:59.996 --> 1:12:02.329
who would love to know
that you're not.

1:12:02.331 --> 1:12:04.033
Why not just disappear?

1:12:07.203 --> 1:12:08.771
We are what we are.

1:12:11.173 --> 1:12:12.574
Right?

1:12:18.114 --> 1:12:20.714
Giler. One million dollars.

1:12:20.716 --> 1:12:22.550
The price is two million.

1:12:57.053 --> 1:12:58.921
<i>Why did you kill Petra?</i>

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:06.896
She murdered
an MI6 colleague of mine.

1:13:09.564 --> 1:13:12.101
I found myself in a position
to return the favor.

1:13:14.770 --> 1:13:16.703
So what was the problem?

1:13:16.705 --> 1:13:18.640
I was ordered
to stand down.

1:13:19.308 --> 1:13:20.407
I did it anyway.

1:13:20.409 --> 1:13:22.577
MI6 ordered you
to stand down?

1:13:26.849 --> 1:13:27.850
No.

1:13:28.250 --> 1:13:29.651
CIA.

1:13:31.653 --> 1:13:35.257
CIA hired Petra
to track and kill U17.

1:13:36.658 --> 1:13:38.727
Anyway, I shot her.

1:13:39.661 --> 1:13:43.299
CIA got very upset,
MI6 had to do something.

1:13:47.837 --> 1:13:51.505
Petra was meant to kill U17

1:13:51.507 --> 1:13:53.976
before my family's
plane went down.

1:13:55.377 --> 1:13:56.944
So that's why I'm here.

1:13:56.946 --> 1:13:59.315
To finish the mission
you fucked up.

1:14:00.983 --> 1:14:04.186
Was your wife
the MI6 colleague?

1:14:11.260 --> 1:14:12.995
Any regrets then?

1:14:14.130 --> 1:14:15.863
You told me revenge
is never worth it.

1:14:15.865 --> 1:14:18.734
So I'm asking you,
any regrets?

1:14:46.661 --> 1:14:48.495
Giler's security is tight.

1:14:48.497 --> 1:14:49.796
No gun will get through,

1:14:49.798 --> 1:14:51.532
- not the way you're going in.
- Which is how?

1:14:51.534 --> 1:14:53.600
He owns a penthouse
on Central Park West.

1:14:53.602 --> 1:14:54.968
Not his family home.

1:14:54.970 --> 1:14:57.173
- A mistress?
- Call girls.

1:14:58.741 --> 1:15:01.775
Gas him first.
Square in the face, okay?

1:15:01.777 --> 1:15:03.110
- Are you listening?
- Mmm.

1:15:03.112 --> 1:15:04.180
When he goes down,

1:15:05.514 --> 1:15:06.847
cut his throat.

1:15:06.849 --> 1:15:09.752
You go in deep, you go in hard.
Ear to ear.

1:15:10.252 --> 1:15:11.451
Gas him first,

1:15:11.453 --> 1:15:14.023
or you won't manage.
And wait until you're undressed.

1:15:15.925 --> 1:15:18.525
- You got a better idea?
- I don't have a worse one.

1:15:18.527 --> 1:15:19.860
You have to walk out,
not run out,

1:15:19.862 --> 1:15:21.764
and you can't do that
covered in blood.

1:15:25.134 --> 1:15:26.969
- You okay?
- Why wouldn't I be?

1:15:33.008 --> 1:15:35.442
I never thought
you'd get this far.

1:15:53.028 --> 1:15:54.129
Penthouse.

1:15:57.666 --> 1:16:00.469
One moment. Guys?

1:16:03.138 --> 1:16:04.406
I'll take that.

1:16:09.545 --> 1:16:10.813
Hands out.

1:16:15.351 --> 1:16:16.416
"Salbadal..."

1:16:16.418 --> 1:16:18.387
Salbutamol. I'm asthmatic.

1:16:19.755 --> 1:16:21.523
All that heavy breathing, huh?

1:16:23.259 --> 1:16:24.760
Showtime.

1:16:37.940 --> 1:16:39.806
He's just such
a petty motherfucker.

1:16:39.808 --> 1:16:41.208
No, no, no.

1:16:41.210 --> 1:16:42.909
No, Terry. No, no.

1:16:42.911 --> 1:16:45.247
You tell him
I don't give a flying fuck.

1:16:46.148 --> 1:16:47.848
I'll just pull
the fucking plug.

1:16:47.850 --> 1:16:49.383
I'll pull the plug right now.

1:16:49.385 --> 1:16:52.687
- No, no, you tell him what I said the first time.
- Hold on. Hold on.

1:16:52.689 --> 1:16:54.823
- Who the hell are you?
- Lisa.

1:16:55.557 --> 1:16:56.758
- Who?
- Lisa.

1:16:56.760 --> 1:16:58.927
- Where the fuck is Madeleine?
- She's off sick.

1:16:59.895 --> 1:17:02.496
She's off sick?

1:17:02.498 --> 1:17:04.699
- Nobody told me that.
- I'm sorry, is there a problem?

1:17:04.701 --> 1:17:06.066
Yeah, a big fucking problem.

1:17:06.068 --> 1:17:07.567
Not less than
forty fucking inches.

1:17:07.569 --> 1:17:08.802
They should know that by now.

1:17:08.804 --> 1:17:11.805
What are you, 36, max?

1:17:11.807 --> 1:17:14.141
I can't work
with this shit, come on!

1:17:14.143 --> 1:17:16.512
- It's never been done.
- Oh, it's been done plenty.

1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:19.846
You do all the shit
Maddie does?

1:17:19.848 --> 1:17:21.948
- With her tits and all?
- Oh, I can do a lot more.

1:17:21.950 --> 1:17:23.884
- Yeah?
- I think you'll be surprised

1:17:23.886 --> 1:17:25.519
by what I do for you.

1:17:25.521 --> 1:17:26.889
Oh, wow.

1:17:29.759 --> 1:17:31.525
All right, I guess
it's my lucky day.

1:17:31.527 --> 1:17:32.961
Where's the bathroom?

1:17:33.862 --> 1:17:35.295
- You got to use the bathroom?
- Yes.

1:17:35.297 --> 1:17:36.163
Come on.

1:17:36.165 --> 1:17:37.364
It's right behind you,
it's on the left.

1:17:37.366 --> 1:17:40.169
Make it quick.
I got to call Tokyo in an hour.

1:18:17.206 --> 1:18:20.242
The fuck you doing
in there? Let's go!

1:18:23.011 --> 1:18:24.611
What are you doing
in there, Cinderella?

1:18:33.255 --> 1:18:35.322
Put your head down on my cock.

1:18:35.324 --> 1:18:36.325
Head down.

1:18:40.062 --> 1:18:42.531
Close your eyes.

1:18:49.571 --> 1:18:51.640
Please don't.
Please don't.

1:18:53.710 --> 1:18:54.975
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.

1:18:54.977 --> 1:18:56.943
Don't kill me, please.
I have children.

1:18:56.945 --> 1:18:59.615
A little girl.
She's only nine years old.

1:19:29.945 --> 1:19:31.947
I couldn't.

1:19:32.715 --> 1:19:34.082
I just couldn't.

1:19:59.074 --> 1:20:01.341
<i>NYPD sources
have now confirmed</i>

1:20:01.343 --> 1:20:03.577
<i>the identities
of the four fatalities</i>

1:20:03.579 --> 1:20:06.079
<i>in the car explosion
earlier this afternoon.</i>

1:20:06.081 --> 1:20:08.749
<i>Leon Giler,
his chauffeur Adam Ross,</i>

1:20:08.751 --> 1:20:10.183
<i>and Giler's two children:</i>

1:20:10.185 --> 1:20:13.220
<i>Michael, aged eleven,
and Melissa, aged nine.</i>

1:21:15.852 --> 1:21:18.220
That wasn't Plan A.
You were.

1:21:21.089 --> 1:21:23.356
I saw the target
get into the vehicle.

1:21:23.358 --> 1:21:25.760
I didn't know
the children were in there.

1:21:25.762 --> 1:21:28.497
I have to live with that
for the rest of my life.

1:21:37.740 --> 1:21:38.775
Where are you going?

1:21:41.878 --> 1:21:43.345
Away from you.

1:22:05.133 --> 1:22:06.435
<i>Stephanie.</i>

1:22:07.837 --> 1:22:10.103
<i>Stephanie, are you there?</i>

1:22:10.105 --> 1:22:14.775
<i>Look, that bomb
that Reza's making for U17,</i>

1:22:14.777 --> 1:22:17.243
<i>there's still no intelligence
on the target or the place...</i>

1:22:17.245 --> 1:22:18.848
I've got
my own plan, Boyd.

1:22:19.782 --> 1:22:21.416
I'm gonna do this my way.

1:23:29.819 --> 1:23:31.286
What happened?

1:23:32.722 --> 1:23:35.424
I don't know if I can be
who I was before.

1:23:58.981 --> 1:24:00.783
You need some sleep.

1:24:45.494 --> 1:24:47.797
Why did you leave
the CIA, Marc?

1:24:49.232 --> 1:24:51.098
Okay.

1:24:51.100 --> 1:24:52.565
<i>The things they asked me to do</i>

1:24:52.567 --> 1:24:54.802
went way beyond
the call of duty.

1:24:54.804 --> 1:24:55.836
You do that once,

1:24:55.838 --> 1:24:57.572
you know it's wrong,
but you get over it.

1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:00.941
And so you do it again.

1:25:00.943 --> 1:25:03.276
And again. And again.

1:25:03.278 --> 1:25:07.683
Until eventually,
you feel nothing at all.

1:25:09.618 --> 1:25:11.752
<i>So that's why
you're doing this now?</i>

1:25:11.754 --> 1:25:13.788
I was out on my own
and I had only one skillset

1:25:13.790 --> 1:25:16.924
that had any value,
so I exploited it.

1:25:16.926 --> 1:25:20.460
Then it was because
I needed to. Now it's...

1:25:20.462 --> 1:25:22.631
It's just the thing I do.

1:25:25.067 --> 1:25:26.601
Are you happy?

1:25:27.870 --> 1:25:29.337
Are you?

1:25:32.507 --> 1:25:34.208
If you would've told me
when I was fifteen

1:25:34.210 --> 1:25:36.078
this is where I'd be now...

1:25:38.346 --> 1:25:40.413
I can't even imagine
how I would've reacted,

1:25:40.415 --> 1:25:42.082
apart from being angry.

1:25:42.084 --> 1:25:44.285
- Angry teenager, huh?
- Mmm.

1:25:44.287 --> 1:25:46.689
<i>With the whole world.
All the time.</i>

1:25:58.734 --> 1:26:00.002
I'm sure.

1:26:38.540 --> 1:26:40.674
- <i>Hey.</i>
- What is it?

1:26:40.676 --> 1:26:44.680
<i>U17 is the one who hired Serra
to take care of Giler.</i>

1:26:46.215 --> 1:26:48.749
- <i>Stephanie?</i>
- How did you find out?

1:26:48.751 --> 1:26:50.317
<i>Yeah, don't worry
about that right now.</i>

1:26:50.319 --> 1:26:51.921
- <i>Just listen.</i>
- Hey...

1:26:52.554 --> 1:26:54.021
Who told you this?

1:26:54.023 --> 1:26:56.422
<i>What you need to know
is U17 is now eliminating</i>

1:26:56.424 --> 1:26:58.094
<i>all connections to him.</i>

1:26:58.761 --> 1:27:01.429
<i>So Serra is clearly next.</i>

1:27:02.098 --> 1:27:03.498
<i>And so are you.</i>

1:27:06.568 --> 1:27:07.904
<i>I have
another contract.</i>

1:27:11.240 --> 1:27:12.909
- Who?
- U17.

1:27:14.243 --> 1:27:15.978
- Who is the client?
- You are.

1:27:17.046 --> 1:27:21.048
I just found out U17 used you
to take out Giler.

1:27:21.050 --> 1:27:22.584
That means you're next.

1:27:24.419 --> 1:27:25.620
So what do you know?

1:27:28.357 --> 1:27:30.126
Right.
Talk to you later.

1:27:40.303 --> 1:27:42.104
U17's gonna be
in Marseille.

1:27:45.041 --> 1:27:46.108
When?

1:27:49.312 --> 1:27:52.112
At a peace march.
He's making a device.

1:27:52.114 --> 1:27:54.116
- Who is?
- U17.

1:27:56.252 --> 1:27:57.887
He's not even a believer.

1:27:58.553 --> 1:28:00.788
He's got no faith at all.

1:28:00.790 --> 1:28:03.159
Everything he does,
he does for profit.

1:28:04.427 --> 1:28:06.894
Not for the Prophet.

1:28:06.896 --> 1:28:08.329
You know his name?

1:28:08.331 --> 1:28:09.964
Mohammed Reza.

1:28:09.966 --> 1:28:12.700
- He's a bombmaker.
- I know who Reza is.

1:28:12.702 --> 1:28:14.802
I used to think
that's all he was.

1:28:14.804 --> 1:28:16.671
We didn't realize
that he could've been both.

1:28:27.917 --> 1:28:29.185
You sure it's him?

1:28:30.518 --> 1:28:31.885
Are you sure
you want to do this?

1:28:31.887 --> 1:28:32.886
I'm sure.

1:28:32.888 --> 1:28:35.124
- Because if something goes...
- I'm sure.

1:31:18.988 --> 1:31:20.187
Why don't
use the phone?

1:31:20.189 --> 1:31:21.722
You just don't
need the phone.

1:31:21.724 --> 1:31:23.025
You just don't need it.

1:31:29.074 --> 1:31:30.038
I'm with you.

1:31:31.715 --> 1:31:32.984
Samira, we're in this together.

1:31:32.986 --> 1:31:35.987
But he said to use the phone. That was the plan.

1:33:26.115 --> 1:33:27.447
Fuck.

1:33:27.449 --> 1:33:28.450
Fuck.

1:33:29.518 --> 1:33:30.519
Shit.

1:34:03.472 --> 1:34:04.753
Open the doors.

1:34:04.755 --> 1:34:06.849
I can't let you off here, sir.

1:34:06.851 --> 1:34:07.544
Why?

1:34:07.546 --> 1:34:09.301
The demonstration is right outside.

1:34:09.303 --> 1:34:10.826
Where's the detonator?

1:34:12.561 --> 1:34:14.294
Reza...

1:34:14.296 --> 1:34:16.463
I'm gonna shoot you
through the fucking spine.

1:34:16.465 --> 1:34:17.699
Where's the detonator?

1:34:17.701 --> 1:34:19.468
If you shoot me,
everyone dies.

1:34:24.830 --> 1:34:26.096
Open the doors... Now!

1:34:26.815 --> 1:34:27.903
Everyone get out!!

1:34:28.595 --> 1:34:29.509
Everyone get out!!

1:34:29.511 --> 1:34:30.600
It's not working.

1:34:30.602 --> 1:34:31.900
There's a bomb!

1:34:32.662 --> 1:34:34.044
The detonator's not working!

1:35:50.292 --> 1:35:51.360
Who are you?

1:35:56.766 --> 1:35:58.367
You killed my family.

1:36:01.303 --> 1:36:04.440
Serra sent you.
He'll kill you, too.

1:36:05.040 --> 1:36:06.241
I know.

1:36:07.069 --> 1:36:09.971
It's a timer. It's a timer!! It's a timer!!

1:36:11.687 --> 1:36:12.408
You coward!

1:36:13.582 --> 1:36:14.583
Go.

1:36:18.554 --> 1:36:20.320
Go!

1:38:15.705 --> 1:38:18.538
Well, just let me know
when you know for sure...

1:38:18.540 --> 1:38:19.676
Yeah. Call you back.

1:38:24.881 --> 1:38:27.380
- Hey.
- I have something to tell you.

1:38:27.382 --> 1:38:29.585
I lost my family
three years ago.

1:38:41.998 --> 1:38:43.332
They were killed...

1:38:45.634 --> 1:38:48.370
...on the flight that exploded
over the Atlantic.

1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:52.775
Flight 147.

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:04.821
What was that?

1:39:06.756 --> 1:39:07.890
You know what it was.

1:39:09.257 --> 1:39:10.559
I've been dying
for three years.

1:39:12.394 --> 1:39:14.129
For you,
it'll be a few minutes.

1:39:19.601 --> 1:39:20.636
What's it feel like?

1:39:21.738 --> 1:39:22.970
Hmm?

1:39:22.972 --> 1:39:24.172
How does it feel?

1:39:27.442 --> 1:39:29.810
You shouldn't have
told me Reza was U17.

1:39:29.812 --> 1:39:31.480
He's a fucking nobody.

1:39:32.915 --> 1:39:35.417
Sending me to kill
U17's connections.

1:39:38.021 --> 1:39:40.322
That's when I knew
it was you. So...

1:39:41.356 --> 1:39:42.925
Probably shouldn't
have done that.

1:39:46.561 --> 1:39:49.531
You thought I wouldn't
want to believe it, hmm?

1:39:52.567 --> 1:39:55.270
We were both pretending
to be someone else.

1:40:04.312 --> 1:40:06.381
I just fucking did it better.

1:41:19.387 --> 1:41:20.757
There's no one left.

1:41:44.013 --> 1:41:45.014
Stephanie?

1:41:49.118 --> 1:41:50.585
Are you Stephanie?

1:42:27.156 --> 1:42:28.490
Whoever you are...

1:42:30.860 --> 1:42:31.861
...thank you.

1:42:35.231 --> 1:42:36.431
Don't mention it.

1:42:37.099 --> 1:42:38.100
Ever.

1:43:09.832 --> 1:43:11.732
Back in MI6?

1:43:11.734 --> 1:43:13.200
I could be.

1:43:13.202 --> 1:43:14.937
One sharp twist.

1:43:18.708 --> 1:43:20.508
Petra needs to disappear.

1:43:21.944 --> 1:43:23.145
My name's Stephanie.

1:43:41.463 --> 1:43:43.398
I hope I never
see you again.

1:43:46.702 --> 1:43:47.703
Do you?
