WEBVTT

00:07.105 --> 00:09.607
They were telling me
more of these stories.

00:09.608 --> 00:14.408
Mom, Vaunette wants to
hear about Uncle Will.

00:16.114 --> 00:17.481
[Gasps]

00:17.482 --> 00:20.817
Is this the man you saw?

00:20.818 --> 00:24.821
It just seemed like it was
behind the trees, it was moving.

00:24.822 --> 00:27.190
It was kind of a Dale boy initiation.

00:27.191 --> 00:29.481
[Boys shouting indistinctly]

00:29.482 --> 00:32.481
I didn't think you believed in ghosts.

00:32.482 --> 00:33.631
[Gunshot]

00:33.632 --> 00:35.132
[Boys shout]

00:35.133 --> 00:37.134
[Screaming]

00:37.135 --> 00:37.958
[Gasps]

00:37.959 --> 00:40.738
Pull me up! Pull me up! Pull me up now!

00:40.739 --> 00:43.274
Uncle Will wasn't...
he wasn't a bogeyman.

00:43.275 --> 00:44.742
[Gasps]

00:44.743 --> 00:47.203
He was real.

01:10.968 --> 01:14.982
It was in the winter of 1989, I'd...

01:14.983 --> 01:18.442
Kind of come home. Found out that um...

01:18.443 --> 01:20.324
That my brother Timmy
and his wife, Susie,

01:20.325 --> 01:23.246
and their children were gonna
be moving back into the farm.

01:23.247 --> 01:24.481
Dan.

01:24.482 --> 01:26.249
I didn't want to move back to the farm.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.484
Good to see you.

01:27.485 --> 01:30.053
- You know, lost my job.
- Where's your wife?

01:30.054 --> 01:32.523
Just financially, we
didn't really have a choice.

01:32.524 --> 01:35.326
I didn't want my family
to be on the street.

01:35.327 --> 01:36.593
Hey, Matthew. Hey, Laura.

01:36.594 --> 01:37.928
- How are you guys?
- Good.

01:37.929 --> 01:40.163
I was very young when
my parents moved in.

01:40.164 --> 01:42.933
Laura, can you guys go
play outside, please?

01:42.934 --> 01:43.972
Okay.

01:43.973 --> 01:47.571
It was a bit tight and cramped. There
was a lot of people living there.

01:47.572 --> 01:50.574
I know it put a strain on my mom.

01:50.575 --> 01:54.362
She had lung cancer,
and it was a hard time.

01:54.363 --> 01:57.063
[Chuckles weakly]

01:57.782 --> 01:59.849
Well, when Tim moved
back to the farm, I was a,

01:59.850 --> 02:02.152
you know, teenager,
getting out of high school.

02:02.153 --> 02:05.917
My mom took him back in,
you know, to help him out.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.491
I thought it was nice.
I liked Tim. I liked Sue.

02:08.493 --> 02:10.259
Here, Tim. Here's
something you can carry.

02:10.261 --> 02:13.397
Oh, that's really funny.
Thanks. Pass me something else.

02:13.398 --> 02:16.700
With family, that's what
you do. You help 'em out.

02:16.701 --> 02:22.601
It was great having Tim and Steve
and I back together in the farm.

02:25.552 --> 02:29.112
That first night, well, we
got together for Featherbones.

02:29.113 --> 02:30.947
Hey, Timmy, where are
those ribs at, buddy?

02:30.948 --> 02:32.383
Oh, there they are.

02:32.384 --> 02:35.819
I love cooking them. I
really doctored them up.

02:35.820 --> 02:39.055
Tim's an incredible...
just an incredible cook.

02:39.056 --> 02:41.692
Eating was big. We liked to eat.

02:41.693 --> 02:45.028
Vaunette, at the time, we were dating.

02:45.029 --> 02:49.933
She lived close by on a farm
not too far away from us.

02:49.934 --> 02:54.571
I had known Dan more
or less my entire life.

02:54.572 --> 02:57.808
I was living still at
home with my parents.

02:57.809 --> 03:00.076
Have one for the Chef.

03:00.077 --> 03:03.189
And we sat around, and we were
talking and having a good time,

03:03.190 --> 03:05.636
just reminiscing about
when we were children.

03:05.637 --> 03:08.449
When we would get loud,
we'd get obnoxious,

03:08.450 --> 03:10.921
and the big line we'd
hear from mom was, is...

03:10.922 --> 03:13.056
"We've got 101/2 acres
of land out there".

03:13.057 --> 03:15.515
- What are you doing in the house?
- Get out of my house...

03:15.516 --> 03:17.761
Both: And go play.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.195
All the time.

03:19.196 --> 03:22.707
Mom was the head of the family,
the entire head of family.

03:22.708 --> 03:25.268
She kept everything together.

03:25.269 --> 03:28.209
You know what, mom?

03:28.573 --> 03:31.374
Here's to you. Guys, drinks up.

03:31.375 --> 03:34.016
I was becoming more a family member,

03:34.017 --> 03:36.881
so they were telling me
more of these stories.

03:36.882 --> 03:41.284
That is our great-great-grandfather,
Dennis Lonergan.

03:41.285 --> 03:42.419
Oh, yeah?

03:42.420 --> 03:45.188
Dennis Lonergan had two sons.

03:45.189 --> 03:50.861
Charlie, who would've been my
great-grandfather, and his other son, Will.

03:50.862 --> 03:54.932
Dan had told me that his Uncle
Will had passed away in 1939.

03:54.933 --> 03:59.369
Hey, mom, Vaunette wants
to hear about Uncle Will.

03:59.370 --> 04:03.674
And it was becoming clearer that
not everybody is a nice person.

04:03.675 --> 04:09.145
Tell her story about the time he laughed
at you when you fell off your horse.

04:09.146 --> 04:10.921
Really?

04:10.922 --> 04:15.251
Uncle Will wasn't... he
wasn't a bogeyman. He was real.

04:15.252 --> 04:16.678
[Hoarsely] First, you got to...

04:16.678 --> 04:18.899
[Coughing]

04:19.390 --> 04:22.325
- Mom, are you okay?
- I'll take her. I'll take her.

04:22.326 --> 04:24.406
It's overwhelming at times
to take care of someone

04:24.407 --> 04:26.463
you love when you know
that they're dying.

04:26.464 --> 04:28.523
And there's nothing you can do about it,

04:28.524 --> 04:33.264
but try and make them
feel more comfortable.

04:36.140 --> 04:42.040
It was late in the evening, and
I remember shutting things down.

04:42.259 --> 04:45.983
Turning off the TV, turning out
the lights, heading up to bed.

04:45.984 --> 04:47.684
[Ominous music]

04:47.685 --> 04:50.353
Good night, mom.

04:50.354 --> 04:56.254
I just got this... got a strange
feeling that something just wasn't right.

04:59.230 --> 05:02.710
[Discordant musical flourish]

05:15.747 --> 05:20.617
It wasn't long after we moved back, I
decided to take a walk around the property.

05:20.618 --> 05:23.420
Thanks so much for
helping us move our things.

05:23.421 --> 05:26.222
Of course, man. You're family.

05:26.223 --> 05:28.926
Timmy and I were pretty close.
We're pretty close brothers.

05:28.927 --> 05:31.195
- Yeah, it's good to see you again.
- [Grunts]

05:31.196 --> 05:33.718
Oh, no, you did not just
start a snowball fight with me.

05:33.719 --> 05:34.926
I did.

05:34.927 --> 05:39.909
You jump over logs and go under
trees and go through thistles.

05:39.910 --> 05:45.810
And when you got through the
woods, you'd start to see the house.

05:48.046 --> 05:52.783
Back when it was first built, it
was probably a pretty nice house.

05:52.784 --> 05:55.039
And it was falling apart.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.254
I mean, it was condemned.

05:58.255 --> 06:01.157
That was Uncle Will's house.

06:01.158 --> 06:06.429
You know, the place just
scared me since I was a kid.

06:06.430 --> 06:09.265
Do you want to go inside?

06:09.266 --> 06:11.249
I tell you, there just seemed like a...

06:11.250 --> 06:14.286
There was... there was something there.

06:14.287 --> 06:16.439
And we kept hearing this pounding.

06:16.440 --> 06:17.641
[Thud reverberates]

06:17.642 --> 06:20.343
What's that pounding?

06:20.344 --> 06:23.224
[Heartbeat thumping]

06:25.516 --> 06:27.517
We finally figured out
it was our own hearts.

06:27.518 --> 06:28.919
[Chuckles]

06:28.920 --> 06:30.208
[Chuckling]

06:30.209 --> 06:34.014
My heart was pounding because I had heard
ghost stories all my life growing up.

06:34.015 --> 06:38.102
And here I am, going
to this abandoned house.

06:38.103 --> 06:41.197
Tim, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go
back to the house and check on mom.

06:41.198 --> 06:44.198
I'll see you later.

07:00.652 --> 07:01.852
[Twigs snapping]

07:01.853 --> 07:03.486
I heard something.

07:03.487 --> 07:07.181
I heard, you know, a twig breaking.

07:07.182 --> 07:11.802
And I had the feeling
something was there.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.513
Hello?

07:22.473 --> 07:26.844
One of the things we had at
the farm were many outbuildings.

07:26.845 --> 07:30.067
That morning, I'm in the barn.

07:30.068 --> 07:33.908
It's dark. It's kind of dusty.

07:34.585 --> 07:37.165
[Metal jingles]

07:38.056 --> 07:41.236
I'd heard these bells.

07:43.695 --> 07:46.229
[Metal jingles]

07:46.230 --> 07:48.631
I heard these bells.

07:48.632 --> 07:49.866
[Metal jingles]

07:49.867 --> 07:54.737
They were off in the
distance, and there was no...

07:54.738 --> 07:57.043
There was nobody there.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.684
[Metal jingling]

08:03.647 --> 08:08.018
Like, I hear these bells, like someone
with spurs on their shoes. They're walking.

08:08.019 --> 08:10.659
[Metal jingling]

08:14.291 --> 08:16.093
There's no one in the barn.

08:16.094 --> 08:19.994
There's no one outside the barn.

08:21.866 --> 08:24.549
And it sounded just...

08:24.550 --> 08:27.550
Very ominous, very...

08:28.227 --> 08:31.274
Very frightening as it got
closer and closer to me.

08:31.275 --> 08:34.275
[Jingling approaching]

08:34.278 --> 08:36.738
[Eerie music]

08:42.285 --> 08:44.756
I go, "Danny, you hear the bells?"

08:44.757 --> 08:46.928
He looked at me like...

08:46.929 --> 08:48.491
Yeah, I heard the bells.

08:48.492 --> 08:50.534
I don't know what those bells were.

08:50.535 --> 08:53.663
I can't really explain it.

08:53.664 --> 08:54.664
[Sighs]

08:54.665 --> 08:55.999
What are you working on?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.960
Oh, I'm just fixing the old saw.

09:00.571 --> 09:02.572
She's in pretty rough shape.

09:02.573 --> 09:05.393
Is that the well?

09:07.044 --> 09:09.579
Danny, does this well still work?

09:09.580 --> 09:11.619
We didn't have city water.

09:11.620 --> 09:15.952
It was out in the middle of the
country. Everybody had a well.

09:15.953 --> 09:18.588
I remember it was the only water we had.

09:18.589 --> 09:22.058
Still the same. Still no city water.

09:22.059 --> 09:26.113
You'd look down, and it's
a good 75, 80 feet deep.

09:26.114 --> 09:28.581
It's a scary thing to
look down and see just a

09:28.582 --> 09:31.168
little dot of water
down at the bottom of it.

09:31.169 --> 09:33.469
Two, three, four...

09:33.470 --> 09:37.908
And I remember, when I was kid, that
somehow an animal got down there.

09:37.909 --> 09:43.729
It took me back to that day
when I had to go down there.

09:43.981 --> 09:46.414
Three, four...

09:46.415 --> 09:48.384
Five, six...

09:48.385 --> 09:49.986
[Water splashes]

09:49.987 --> 09:51.621
Man, it stinks down there.

09:51.622 --> 09:57.027
My mom was like, you guys need to go down
and check the well and see what's happened.

09:57.028 --> 09:58.785
Well, I didn't leave the cover off.

09:58.786 --> 10:01.798
Well, if it wasn't me and it wasn't
Steve, then it must've been you, Dan.

10:01.799 --> 10:03.566
I swear it wasn't.

10:03.567 --> 10:07.947
I was old enough to be able to do it.

10:12.009 --> 10:14.644
Found this old rope in the back.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.179
Seems strong enough. It should work.

10:16.180 --> 10:21.084
So I got volunteered to
get the dead animal out.

10:21.085 --> 10:23.348
- All right, let's do it.
- Okay.

10:23.349 --> 10:27.057
You know, you don't mess with a
well, you know, that's very scary.

10:27.058 --> 10:32.958
But you'd never want to fall down there
because you knew you were gonna die.

10:33.397 --> 10:37.400
I had taken a fish net
to pick up the animal...

10:37.401 --> 10:39.870
All right, start to lower me down.

10:39.871 --> 10:45.771
And my brothers would pull me
back up, and this was our plan.

10:51.143 --> 10:55.043
I was extremely nervous about it.

10:55.286 --> 10:58.166
Dan, you're heavy.

10:58.455 --> 11:01.095
[Metal rattling]

11:02.059 --> 11:04.961
And this well was pretty deep,
so you couldn't see the bottom.

11:04.962 --> 11:09.762
It was just a dark
hole down at the bottom.

11:10.268 --> 11:13.836
I remember lowering him down there
it's a... you know, it's a deep well.

11:13.837 --> 11:17.140
The lower I got, it
got scarier and scarier.

11:17.141 --> 11:19.721
[Ominous music]

11:25.116 --> 11:26.216
[Water splashes]

11:26.217 --> 11:29.352
Okay, I've reached the bottom.

11:29.353 --> 11:32.893
I shined my flashlight down.

11:33.324 --> 11:36.325
[Discordant musical flourish]

11:36.326 --> 11:42.226
It was a dead raccoon that had been
there for at least a couple days.

11:43.434 --> 11:46.014
Oh, it smells.

11:51.218 --> 11:54.218
And at that point...

11:54.367 --> 11:57.180
I heard someone whisper to me.

11:57.181 --> 12:00.361
[Whispering indistinctly]

12:01.185 --> 12:03.619
Did you guys say something?

12:03.620 --> 12:06.456
I think Danny thought that we
were playing a joke or something,

12:06.457 --> 12:07.991
but we didn't say anything.

12:07.992 --> 12:09.960
No, I didn't say anything. Did you?

12:09.961 --> 12:13.896
- I didn't say nothing.
- No, we didn't say anything.

12:13.897 --> 12:19.002
And as I'm reaching down with the net,
I heard something talk in my ear again...

12:19.003 --> 12:22.183
[Whispering indistinctly]

12:22.302 --> 12:24.898
And it sounded like
it was right behind me.

12:24.899 --> 12:26.258
[Intense music]

12:26.259 --> 12:28.778
[Whispering indistinctly]

12:28.779 --> 12:32.082
I felt like I was... I
wasn't alone in the well.

12:32.083 --> 12:34.351
[Whispering] I'm gonna cut you.

12:34.352 --> 12:36.849
No matter how I turned or
spun around on the rope,

12:36.850 --> 12:39.856
there was someone right behind
me. It was absolutely terrifying.

12:39.857 --> 12:44.537
[Whispering] I'm gonna
skin you alive, boy.

12:53.633 --> 12:57.169
[Whispering] I'm gonna
skin you alive, boy.

12:57.170 --> 13:00.705
Pull me up! Pull me up! Pull me up now!

13:00.706 --> 13:04.079
I reached down, scooped the raccoon up.

13:04.080 --> 13:07.045
And said... yelled at
them to pull me up now.

13:07.046 --> 13:09.289
Guys, pull me up!
Pull me up! Pull me up!

13:09.290 --> 13:13.800
I started screaming at them, and they
pulled me up the well fairly quickly.

13:13.801 --> 13:16.203
- Were you guys talking to me?
- Wasn't us.

13:16.204 --> 13:17.671
They knew that something was wrong.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.407
- Was it you guys?
- No.

13:19.408 --> 13:22.830
Come on, don't lie to me.
Just get me out of here.

13:22.831 --> 13:28.256
As a kid, that was my main fear, was that
there was someone in the well with me.

13:28.257 --> 13:34.157
But as an adult, I knew there
couldn't be anything down there.

13:34.844 --> 13:40.744
As I look back on it, I've never been able
to come up with a rational explanation.

13:47.722 --> 13:51.478
Well, as my mom's cancer progressed.

13:51.479 --> 13:56.563
And they had kind of
told us that mom wasn't...

13:56.564 --> 13:59.642
Wasn't going to probably
live through the weekend...

13:59.643 --> 14:03.270
That evening, I was
there with mom alone.

14:03.271 --> 14:07.365
It had been at least a day
since she'd even talked.

14:07.366 --> 14:13.266
And it... she had been in and out
of consciousness the entire time.

14:36.270 --> 14:38.472
What's wrong, mom?

14:38.473 --> 14:40.933
[Eerie music]

14:41.476 --> 14:46.295
She was looking clearly at someone,
and there was just no one there.

14:46.296 --> 14:49.039
I was the only one in
the room at the time.

14:49.040 --> 14:51.799
It was a very eerie...

14:51.800 --> 14:54.800
A very eerie moment.

14:55.056 --> 14:59.505
I checked on her and realized
that she had passed away.

14:59.506 --> 15:02.026
She was gone.

15:09.439 --> 15:13.406
I helped hold his hand. I
held a lot of their hands.

15:13.407 --> 15:19.206
Here were these three brothers
trying to keep control of the farm.

15:19.207 --> 15:22.294
And get over their loss...

15:22.295 --> 15:25.833
Because she was their world.

15:25.834 --> 15:30.454
Well, my mom was an
awesome person. She...

15:30.692 --> 15:34.112
I sure miss her sometimes.

15:41.402 --> 15:43.862
Ready to go?

15:43.902 --> 15:48.702
It was around Halloween.
It was late October.

15:48.854 --> 15:51.239
It was kind of chilly, it was...

15:51.240 --> 15:54.960
Probably about 11:00 at night.

15:54.995 --> 15:58.719
It was kind of a Dale boy initiation.

Make 'em feel part of the family.

16:01.088 --> 16:05.706
Come on, I'll take you up to Uncle
Will's, and let's see if I can scare you.

16:05.707 --> 16:07.961
And I shook my head and said...

16:07.962 --> 16:12.231
Eh, you're not gonna
be able to scare me.

16:12.232 --> 16:13.765
Hey.

16:13.766 --> 16:16.937
Hey, wait up, Vaunette.

16:16.938 --> 16:22.758
And as you look up, there is
nothing but a wall of trees.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.158
And as you got closer, it
felt like the more the light,

16:26.159 --> 16:29.370
was just sucked out of the area.

16:29.371 --> 16:31.184
There was no sound.

16:31.185 --> 16:33.820
There was no animal sounds.

16:33.821 --> 16:36.577
You didn't hear anything.

16:36.578 --> 16:39.228
And as Dan and I were walking...

16:39.229 --> 16:42.852
He began to tell me
more stories about...

16:42.853 --> 16:45.398
The past and what had happened.

16:45.399 --> 16:50.418
When we were kids, they wanted
us to stay out of the woods.

16:50.419 --> 16:53.243
Uncle Will might get you.

16:53.244 --> 16:56.274
I was just telling her, you
know, a lot of it, of course,

16:56.275 --> 17:00.775
just to build up the scare a little bit.

17:01.583 --> 17:04.477
He did warn me to watch my step.

17:04.478 --> 17:08.609
And there was all kinds of debris and...

17:08.611 --> 17:11.290
You really had to be careful.

17:11.291 --> 17:15.551
Want to go check out what's upstairs?

17:35.216 --> 17:36.917
You okay?

17:36.918 --> 17:42.818
I was convinced at that point that I was
scare-able, and I'm gonna go back outside.

17:43.858 --> 17:46.018
[Panting]

17:46.027 --> 17:49.207
It's okay. It's okay.

17:50.297 --> 17:52.833
You got to come check out
what's in the basement.

17:52.834 --> 17:55.414
I don't know.

17:55.903 --> 17:58.571
I didn't think you believed in ghosts.

17:58.572 --> 18:00.792
I don't.

[Trapdoor creaking]

He was teasing me. Well,
no, you've got to come in.

18:08.887 --> 18:13.147
You've got to check out the basement.

18:13.267 --> 18:15.650
She didn't want to go into the cellar.

18:15.651 --> 18:19.526
I kind of talked her into
it. We went down there.

18:19.527 --> 18:22.140
Watch your head.

18:22.141 --> 18:27.841
So we go down the steps, and
I'm shining the flashlight.

18:33.074 --> 18:37.154
You could hear your own breathing...

18:37.769 --> 18:42.689
And you could actually
hear your own heartbeat.

18:43.617 --> 18:47.517
Okay, it is a little creepy now.

18:55.629 --> 18:58.531
So I asked Dan, all right, so...

18:58.532 --> 19:00.940
What's purpose of all the holes?

19:00.941 --> 19:05.105
And he's like, oh, that's where
Uncle Will kept his treasure.

19:05.106 --> 19:11.006
Anybody who tried to steal his
treasure would lose their hand.

19:13.057 --> 19:15.097
[Gasps]

19:16.050 --> 19:21.870
Yeah, I wasn't gonna go for that,
so I picked up a couple of sticks...

19:21.871 --> 19:24.972
And I was poking them...

19:24.973 --> 19:27.973
Into different holes.

19:31.365 --> 19:33.656
There was nothing in there.

19:33.657 --> 19:37.296
But there was one that
was a little bit higher.

19:37.297 --> 19:41.737
And for some reason, that was the one...

19:42.086 --> 19:45.326
That I needed to touch.

19:46.114 --> 19:52.014
I can't explain it. I just... I knew
I had to put my hand in that one.

hot pain in my hand.

20:24.971 --> 20:30.871
And it was spreading up to my elbow, and
we could see there was this bite mark.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.881
What could've possibly
bitten her arm like this?

20:35.882 --> 20:39.865
It just looked like human... like
someone had, like a person had bit her.

20:39.866 --> 20:43.869
If it was an actual human bite, then
the person was missing some teeth.

- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah.

up there. That's why she was hurt.

back up to the farmhouse.

28:55.885 --> 28:56.885
[Metal jingling]

28:56.886 --> 28:58.971
Start moving.

28:58.972 --> 29:01.612
[Metal jingling]

29:01.757 --> 29:07.657
You could start hearing the boards
creaking, and we froze again like deer.

29:08.376 --> 29:11.569
They felt something,
they sensed something.

29:11.570 --> 29:14.283
And I know that I started
feeling there was something wrong.

29:14.284 --> 29:15.870
[Intense music]

29:15.871 --> 29:16.905
[Roaring]

29:16.906 --> 29:17.906
[Screams]

29:17.907 --> 29:21.327
[Boys shouting indistinctly]

29:22.311 --> 29:25.012
All I just knew was, I
was getting out of there.

29:25.013 --> 29:26.614
[Shouts]

29:26.615 --> 29:28.349
He was just coming at us fast.

29:28.350 --> 29:29.717
Run!

29:29.718 --> 29:32.821
Tall man coming up the
path... it was moving fast.

29:32.822 --> 29:35.590
And he's covered almost
half the distance.

29:35.591 --> 29:39.694
I was faster than I
had ever ran in my life.

29:39.695 --> 29:43.331
I looked back, and the man's
only a few feet behind me.

29:43.332 --> 29:45.605
Something's right behind Danny.

29:45.606 --> 29:49.838
I was running full speed. Looked
like a little human locomotive.

29:49.839 --> 29:51.939
[Shouts]

29:52.557 --> 29:55.944
I hit that gate, jumped the gate.

29:55.945 --> 29:56.945
[Shouts]

29:56.946 --> 29:59.046
[Growls]

30:03.151 --> 30:08.005
We've been chased off the property
by a man who's been dead for...

30:08.006 --> 30:10.706
35 or 40 years.

30:14.697 --> 30:18.071
The things that we saw when we
were children were still there.

30:18.072 --> 30:21.936
And it was just becoming
much more frightening.

30:21.937 --> 30:24.517
Did you sleep?

30:26.241 --> 30:27.475
Me either.

30:27.476 --> 30:30.512
I don't think that we're imagining this.

30:30.513 --> 30:34.916
There's too many people here
that have experienced this stuff.

30:34.917 --> 30:40.077
There's got to be something
going on here, right?

30:42.958 --> 30:45.538
See you later.

30:50.933 --> 30:54.438
We just... we're trying to
figure out, why are we seeing...

30:54.439 --> 30:58.806
Seeing these things that
we hadn't seen before?

30:58.807 --> 31:01.010
Uncle Will, that's what I thought.

31:01.011 --> 31:03.794
Uncle Will is back.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.146
Since mom had passed away,

31:05.147 --> 31:08.750
the one person I knew who would
know about it would be my Aunt Mary.

31:08.751 --> 31:11.719
She was like a second mom.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.721
[Doorbell rings]

31:13.722 --> 31:16.190
This is a nice surprise.

31:16.191 --> 31:20.327
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you doing?

31:20.328 --> 31:23.564
So I explain to Aunt Mary
what had been going on.

31:23.565 --> 31:27.936
And kind of told her everything that
different people had been experiencing.

31:27.937 --> 31:31.297
There's this man, this...

31:31.703 --> 31:34.540
Gaunt man with a mustache.

31:34.541 --> 31:36.650
Everyone keeps seeing him.

31:36.651 --> 31:38.645
He's in our dreams.

31:38.646 --> 31:40.247
I didn't know who else to come to, so...

31:40.248 --> 31:42.784
Dan, would you go get that
photo album for me, please.

31:42.785 --> 31:47.722
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- I want to show you some pictures.

31:47.723 --> 31:50.454
She had brought out
some pictures to show me.

31:50.455 --> 31:52.437
You remember this one.
This one was at the house.

31:52.438 --> 31:54.195
Yeah, I recognize a few of these.

31:54.196 --> 32:00.096
And there's your great-great-grandfather,
Dennis, and Dennis had two sons.

32:00.102 --> 32:02.802
One was Charlie.

32:02.847 --> 32:07.590
And one of the pictures she
showed me was Uncle Will.

32:07.591 --> 32:10.951
Is this the man you saw?

32:10.978 --> 32:15.785
It was the person that had
chased us off of his property.

32:15.786 --> 32:18.186
That's him.

32:20.089 --> 32:24.289
Aunt Mary told me that
in the early 1900s,

32:24.290 --> 32:27.782
something bad had happened
at the Lonergan Farm.

32:27.783 --> 32:30.423
[Metal jingling]

32:31.757 --> 32:33.579
Will.

32:33.580 --> 32:36.216
Oh, he was a terrible racist.

32:36.217 --> 32:41.197
An African-American that was
working on the farm had...

32:41.198 --> 32:46.568
Done something with a white
woman that had so angered...

32:46.569 --> 32:52.469
Will that Will and some other men decided
that they had to get rid of this man.

32:55.991 --> 32:59.970
I asked Aunt Mary what
exactly had happened.

32:59.971 --> 33:02.731
They lynched him.

33:06.959 --> 33:09.539
[Macabre music]

33:32.638 --> 33:35.218
[Macabre music]

33:41.754 --> 33:44.422
I drove back to the Lonergan Farm.

33:44.423 --> 33:49.060
I just... I couldn't believe that
Uncle Will got away with this.

33:49.061 --> 33:52.936
The idea that someone in my
family could cause this much,

33:52.937 --> 33:55.939
torment for another person...

33:55.940 --> 33:57.914
Is just sickening.

33:57.915 --> 34:00.872
Uncle Will had haunted
us when we were children.

34:00.873 --> 34:05.133
And now he was haunting us as adults.

34:08.643 --> 34:13.951
Growing up at the farm, it was
scary when it was dark or night or...

34:13.952 --> 34:17.755
But for the most part, I
mean, it was a good place.

34:17.757 --> 34:20.337
I was seven...

34:20.935 --> 34:24.498
And I had to share a
room with my sister.

34:24.498 --> 34:28.299
When we were at the farm, I remember
Laura had started having some nightmares.

34:28.300 --> 34:30.002
Auntie Vaunette.

34:30.003 --> 34:33.070
- I used to have a lot of bad dreams.
- Auntie Vaunette!

34:33.071 --> 34:37.350
Sometimes I couldn't tell if they
were real or if they were dreams.

34:37.351 --> 34:41.549
- Hi, Sweetie, why aren't you in bed?
- Can't go to sleep. I'm scared.

34:41.550 --> 34:47.449
Laura and I became really good friends,
and she would tell me all kinds of...

34:48.108 --> 34:51.193
Little things about what
was going on at school.

34:51.194 --> 34:56.473
And then she would talk about
her secrets and her fears.

34:56.474 --> 34:59.716
I wasn't sure if she had had a
nightmare and that's what woke her up,

34:59.717 --> 35:01.945
but she just knew she felt scared.

35:01.946 --> 35:04.356
And my Aunt would always tell me...

35:04.357 --> 35:08.102
"Well, if it's a dream
and you pinch yourself,

35:08.103 --> 35:12.303
you'll know because you'll wake up".

35:16.761 --> 35:19.101
Good night.

35:25.503 --> 35:29.126
I can remember one particular night.

35:29.127 --> 35:34.886
The door, it creaked open, and
it creaked open very slowly.

35:34.887 --> 35:37.447
I saw somebody coming in the room.

35:37.448 --> 35:40.928
[Door creaks, metal jingles]

35:42.565 --> 35:47.469
I couldn't tell who it was, but I
knew it wasn't my mother or my father.

35:47.470 --> 35:51.821
Is this a dream, or is this happening?
Is this a dream, or is this happening?

35:51.822 --> 35:53.037
[Gasps]

35:53.038 --> 35:56.812
If you're having a bad dream, just
pinch yourself, and it'll go away.

35:56.813 --> 36:00.081
Or pinch yourself to wake yourself up.

36:00.082 --> 36:01.917
[Hisses and snarls]

36:01.918 --> 36:05.616
I felt like I couldn't move.
I felt frozen in my skin.

36:05.617 --> 36:08.017
[Baby cries]

36:08.714 --> 36:13.829
My sister was still there. Just
pinch yourself, and you'll wake up.

36:13.830 --> 36:16.847
I was thinking, I need to pinch
myself. I need to pinch myself,

36:16.848 --> 36:18.934
but I couldn't do it. I was just frozen.

36:18.935 --> 36:23.020
I just had that feeling that
they were gonna take her.

36:23.021 --> 36:28.619
I forced myself to pinch myself,
and I screamed, and I screamed.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.900
[Screaming]

36:34.250 --> 36:37.252
[Indistinct radio chatter]

36:37.253 --> 36:40.073
[Suspenseful music]

36:43.716 --> 36:48.141
I was terrified. It was
my fault that she was gone.

36:48.142 --> 36:50.320
I didn't know where my daughter was.

36:50.321 --> 36:53.769
I didn't know if somebody kidnapped her.

36:53.770 --> 36:58.907
Melissa wasn't even barely crawling. She
never even crawled out of the house before.

36:58.908 --> 37:02.500
All right, folks. We're looking
for a baby, her name is Melissa...

37:02.501 --> 37:08.283
We knew that this is what all
these events had been escalating to.

37:08.284 --> 37:12.287
Move very slowly. Check
everything, all right? Off we go.

37:12.288 --> 37:15.406
Something took my
daughter. Why they... why...

37:15.407 --> 37:17.693
Why would anybody do that?

37:17.694 --> 37:21.774
I went cold. I thought, Uncle Will.

37:21.864 --> 37:26.470
Uncle Will's dead, and the
cop isn't gonna know that.

37:26.471 --> 37:31.571
The cop wasn't gonna
believe something like that.

37:31.908 --> 37:33.475
- Why would they?
- Melissa!

37:33.476 --> 37:36.044
When a young kid is
missing, you know, every...

37:36.045 --> 37:38.714
You know, the community comes
together to try to find her.

37:38.715 --> 37:44.615
They would... they had formed human
chains to walk along, looking for her.

37:46.288 --> 37:50.206
There were people everywhere
hollering, looking,

37:50.207 --> 37:54.767
screaming, Melissa,
Melissa, and it just...

37:54.864 --> 37:58.233
It started to echo in the trees.

37:58.234 --> 38:01.594
[Echoing] Melissa! Melissa!

38:02.219 --> 38:03.538
Melissa!

38:03.539 --> 38:08.999
I was worried about not ever
seeing my daughter again.

38:09.478 --> 38:12.050
Well, my sister was married to Timmy,

38:12.051 --> 38:17.084
and I get this call saying
that, Herman, Melissa's missing.

38:17.085 --> 38:18.922
I had to join in the search.

38:18.923 --> 38:20.767
Melissa!

38:20.768 --> 38:24.873
I mean, it's Melissa. It's my niece.

38:24.874 --> 38:27.551
- Melissa!
- Melissa.

38:27.552 --> 38:33.192
I was feeling more panicked.
I was becoming more worried.

38:39.642 --> 38:44.129
And I looked over,
and then I realized...

38:44.130 --> 38:46.976
I was right next to Uncle Will's.

38:46.977 --> 38:49.437
[Tense music]

38:55.158 --> 38:59.494
So I was so focused at
where I needed to go.

38:59.495 --> 39:03.231
No reason, no rhyme. I don't
know. I just have to be there.

39:03.232 --> 39:05.567
We've already looked back there.

39:05.568 --> 39:10.471
You know, it was like I'm driven to
do something, and I don't know why.

39:10.472 --> 39:12.436
[Metal jingling]

39:12.437 --> 39:15.043
All of a sudden, I heard bells.

39:15.044 --> 39:16.912
[Metal jingling]

39:16.913 --> 39:19.547
It was a strange noise.

39:19.548 --> 39:21.616
[Growls]

39:21.617 --> 39:24.619
[Metal jingling, footsteps]

39:24.620 --> 39:27.200
[Intense music]

39:36.935 --> 39:40.235
[Indistinct radio chatter]

39:40.973 --> 39:43.040
- Melissa!
- Melissa!

39:43.041 --> 39:45.141
Melissa!

39:45.210 --> 39:48.990
I knew Melissa was out there...

39:49.462 --> 39:53.122
With the ghost of Uncle Will.

39:54.337 --> 39:58.488
I had decided that I
have to go this direction.

39:58.489 --> 40:04.389
Somebody or something is telling me,
Herman, this is what you need to do.

40:04.563 --> 40:08.771
And I walked through this area
anyway because I was being guided,

40:08.772 --> 40:10.969
and I don't know why.

40:10.970 --> 40:13.610
[Metal jingling]

40:17.109 --> 40:19.569
[Tense music]

40:23.648 --> 40:27.986
At that point, I just see something
that looked like an animal.

40:27.987 --> 40:30.989
[Intense musical flourish]

40:30.990 --> 40:32.823
I'm wondering, what is that?

40:32.824 --> 40:35.626
And as I look down, I
noticed it wasn't an animal.

40:35.627 --> 40:37.195
It was human.

40:37.196 --> 40:39.030
I holler... "I found her!"

40:39.031 --> 40:42.967
I found her. She's over here.
She's alive. I've got her.

40:42.968 --> 40:44.168
I found her!

40:44.169 --> 40:45.422
[Baby crying]

40:45.423 --> 40:48.243
[Sentimental music]

40:49.674 --> 40:53.989
I don't know who or
what guided Herman...

40:53.990 --> 40:58.582
My mom, a guardian angel.
I can't answer that.

40:58.583 --> 41:02.363
And thank God we got her back.

41:03.188 --> 41:05.384
Everything that happened to me.

41:05.385 --> 41:08.389
Everything that happened
to everybody else...

41:08.390 --> 41:13.730
Melissa's disappearance, I
believe it was Uncle Will.

41:13.899 --> 41:18.109
They had centered their life around
their mother in a lot of ways.

41:18.110 --> 41:22.407
And with her gone, Uncle
Will wanted to come back.

41:22.408 --> 41:26.848
He wanted to reclaim that which he lost.

41:39.291 --> 41:41.393
And really...

41:41.394 --> 41:46.030
No one was really upset
to see the house go.

41:46.031 --> 41:48.299
That place was...

41:48.300 --> 41:50.401
Oh, shoot.

41:50.402 --> 41:53.402
That place was evil.

41:58.543 --> 42:01.912
Uncle Will wanted us out
of there, or something did.

42:01.913 --> 42:05.306
I think it was a warning.

42:05.307 --> 42:08.127
I can't say why.

42:08.253 --> 42:12.453
It's just full of, you know, hate...

42:12.836 --> 42:15.536
Malevolence. I...

42:15.652 --> 42:18.062
I'll just... to this
day, I don't understand.
