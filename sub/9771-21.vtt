- Dude.
- Why Quinn?

19:07.312 --> 19:09.565
- I bought 150 cups of coffee
from you this week.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.900
- I saved you from being
attacked by a crazy man.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.528
- Why'd you pick Quinn?
- Yeah. Why did you pick me?

19:14.611 --> 19:16.488
- 'Cause I always pick
a cute girl.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.325
She gets to cut in line,
get some free coffee,

19:20.409 --> 19:22.077
and I usually get
some free makin' out,

19:22.160 --> 19:24.246
if you know what I mean.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.581
- What?
- Brilliant.

19:25.664 --> 19:29.209
- Wait, I am not making out
with you for free coffee.

19:29.293 --> 19:33.964
And anyway, I have a boyfriend.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.591
- And the new
customer of the week

19:35.674 --> 19:37.759
is Molly Talbertsen.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.970

Really?

19:40.053 --> 19:41.179

- No.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.556

all the way here

20:05.287 --> 20:06.538
