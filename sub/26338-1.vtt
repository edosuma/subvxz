08:48.745 --> 08:50.617

08:50.660 --> 08:52.793
You used to do the same
thing when you were eight.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.447
I'd come in your room, and
you'd pretend you were reading.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.972

you were learning something.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.365
Yeah, well, I actually
used to keep

09:00.409 --> 09:02.237
a book on my bed

Ah. You were pretty good

09:14.728 --> 09:16.033
I'm here for Jack,
not you,

10:14.788 --> 10:17.312
went and got himself
into some serious trouble.

10:17.355 --> 10:20.707
Yeah, I know. I heard.
Do we know where he is now?

10:20.750 --> 10:21.969
Unfortunately, we do not.

10:22.012 --> 10:24.406
Okay. Um, any idea why

10:24.449 --> 10:26.495
he'd be willing to break
into a Russian military depot

10:26.538 --> 10:28.105
and steal a bunch of weapons?Again, no.

10:28.149 --> 10:29.933
But I will say this:

10:29.977 --> 10:32.632
ever since you left,
Jack just hasn't been himself.

10:32.675 --> 10:34.677
OVERSIGHT:
Director Webber's being kind.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.896
His behavior's been erratic.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.027
Questioning orders,

10:37.071 --> 10:38.594
second-guessing
operational objectives.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.640
Yeah, but like,
way more than usual.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.903
Then one morning, he just
didn't show up for work.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.644
Well, then, yesterday,

10:44.687 --> 10:45.819
he popped back up on our radar

10:45.862 --> 10:47.342
when Jill intercepted
these photos

10:47.385 --> 10:49.779
being sent around
by Russian Military Police.

10:49.823 --> 10:51.433
MacGYVER:
Yeah, I saw them.

10:51.476 --> 10:52.477
Jill, any luck I.D.'ing

10:52.521 --> 10:54.741
the other guys in the photo?No.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.307
Not from the photos,
which is why Bozer,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.614
Leanna and Riley were sent
to infiltrate the weapons depot,

10:58.658 --> 11:00.747
to download the raw
surveillance footage.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.444
LEANNA:
And that's what Riley's
going through right now.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.838
We're hoping to get a clear shot
of at least one other face.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.014
Guys, I got 'em.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.893
OVERSIGHT:
Right there.

11:16.937 --> 11:18.025
What, you recognize him?

11:18.068 --> 11:21.376
That's Roman Mareks.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.204
No, that can't be.
He's dead.

11:23.247 --> 11:26.729
Okay, I guess I'll be
the one to ask who...

11:26.773 --> 11:29.514
Roman Mareks was--
is, apparently--

11:29.558 --> 11:30.820
the former dictator
of Belarus.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.822
Nine years ago,
he was violently overthrown

11:32.866 --> 11:35.346
by a team of CIA operatives.

11:35.390 --> 11:39.611
Up until now, we thought
he'd been killed in that raid.

11:39.655 --> 11:40.830
MATTY: This is much worse
than we feared.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.093
Why?Because the CIA team

11:43.137 --> 11:44.834
that kicked Mareks out of power

11:44.878 --> 11:46.009
was led by Jack.

11:46.053 --> 11:49.230
At the time, Mareks tried
to bribe Dalton.

11:49.273 --> 11:51.885
Recruit him. Offered him
millions for his services.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.888
Given Dalton's recent behavior
and his attitude towards me,

11:54.931 --> 11:58.935
maybe he finally decided to
take Mareks up on his offer.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.212
BOZER:
We found the 18-wheeler

12:15.256 --> 12:17.084
right where Jill said
it would be.

12:17.127 --> 12:19.303
LEANNA:
But...

12:19.347 --> 12:20.783
there's no sign of Jack, Mareks

12:20.827 --> 12:22.350
or any of the stolen weapons.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.830
MATTY:
Well, that's not a surprise.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.788
A man like Mareks isn't gonna
stay in one place long,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.008
and he's certainly not gonna
drive anything as conspicuous

12:28.051 --> 12:30.924
as an 18-wheeler.

12:32.577 --> 12:34.405
JACK:
Welcome back to Belarus.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.667
It's good to be home.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.105
Once we cross the border,

12:38.148 --> 12:39.846
we're gonna need
to ditch these vehicles,

12:39.889 --> 12:41.935
or we're gonna get a lot
of unwanted attention.

12:41.978 --> 12:43.850
Agreed?

12:43.893 --> 12:46.374
Agreed.
Okay, good.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.332
Hey, guys, over here.

12:49.638 --> 12:50.813
What do you got?Tire tracks.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.684
LEANNA:
Mareks must have moved

12:52.728 --> 12:53.947
whatever they stole
into a smaller vehicle.

12:53.990 --> 12:56.036
He's many things, but
an idiot isn't one.

12:56.079 --> 12:58.212
These tracks could belong
to any full-size truck

12:58.255 --> 13:00.518
with four-wheel drive.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.172
Okay,

13:02.216 --> 13:04.044
this has been bugging me since
we got on the plane back in L.A.

13:04.087 --> 13:08.178
But... does anyone else feel
like something's not adding up?

13:08.222 --> 13:09.571
I mean, why would Mareks
get into business

13:09.614 --> 13:10.833
with the guy who
kicked him out of power?

13:10.877 --> 13:12.356
MATTY:
That's a good question, Boze.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.923
And I have another.

13:13.967 --> 13:16.447
Jack refused the bribe
nine years ago,

13:16.491 --> 13:18.449
so what made Mareks think
he'd play along now?

13:18.493 --> 13:21.757
BOZER:
Hold that thought, Matty.
Mac, where you going?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.979
Back in Afghanistan,
I taught Jack a little trick

13:26.022 --> 13:28.372
we'd use to spot dead drops
for allies.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.897
Wait, you think that mirror
turned away from the road

13:30.940 --> 13:34.030
is Jack's way of leaving behind
a subtle "X marks the spot"?

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
Uh, yeah.Couldn't it just be
a bent mirror?

13:35.902 --> 13:37.773
Could be, but it's not.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.080
Jack left this for us.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.560
Maybe, or maybe Mareks knew
he was being tracked

13:42.604 --> 13:43.953
and had his men
ditch their phones.

13:43.997 --> 13:44.954
Yeah, or maybe
it's our only lead,

13:44.998 --> 13:46.521
so maybe we should
let Riley

13:46.564 --> 13:47.652
check it out.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.750
All right, well, this phone's
only called seven numbers.

13:58.794 --> 13:59.795
Six of 'em are burner phones.

13:59.839 --> 14:02.406
Probably all used
by Marek's men.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.626
Well, this seventh number
is by far the most popular.

14:04.669 --> 14:07.890
It's been called over a dozen
times in the last 24 hours.

14:07.934 --> 14:08.978
Who does it belong to?

14:09.022 --> 14:13.026
It belongs to
Serhiy Yaroslav. Oh.

14:13.069 --> 14:14.288
He's quite the heavy hitter.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.246
MATTY:
Former Ukrainian spec ops.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.944
Yaroslav went into business
for himself

14:17.987 --> 14:19.032
15 years ago.

14:19.075 --> 14:20.903
We need to find
this Yaroslav.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.252
RILEY:
Currently, he's in Roslavl.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.645
That's about two hours
west of us.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.995
Yaroslav knows what
Mareks is up to?

14:27.127 --> 14:29.172
Only one way to find out.

14:35.918 --> 14:37.702
Show me the money!

14:37.746 --> 14:39.922
I'm serious, Mac,
if you were a free agent,

14:39.966 --> 14:41.097
you could name your
price right now.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.360
He's right.
Two weeks after you left,

14:43.404 --> 14:45.101
Matty gave every Phoenix agent

14:45.145 --> 14:46.189
with any kind of
field experience

14:46.233 --> 14:47.277
a bunch of junk
and five minutes.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.932
All they could make
was more junk.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.238
We're serious, no one
can do what you do.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.283
Matty's little "make another
egghead spy" project

14:53.327 --> 14:55.590
died miserably.

14:55.633 --> 14:57.853
And up until Jack disappeared,
she benched us.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.420
The last two months
doing intel gathering.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.988
I'll be honest, I started
taking naps in the afternoon.

15:02.031 --> 15:04.773
Brought a blanket
and everything.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.427
Jill's been busy, though.

15:06.470 --> 15:09.909
Matty's got her running a
task force looking for Murdoc.

15:09.952 --> 15:11.432
Presented Matty
with a game plan,

15:11.475 --> 15:13.869
setting up surveillance
on old contacts.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.436
She's got some promising leads.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.395
Other than teacher's pet
making grades, it's been boring.

15:20.615 --> 15:22.225
And what about Jack?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.883
Well, he didn't handle
your quitting too well.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.580
Guess you could say
he lost his purpose.

15:29.624 --> 15:31.626
Up until you left,
Jack had one job:

15:31.669 --> 15:33.976
to protect you.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.674
Even though you were on the other side of the world,

15:36.718 --> 15:38.807
he still made sure
to keep an eye on you.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.417
BOZER: Yeah, the one thing
that made him happy

15:40.461 --> 15:42.202
was the thought that
you were happy.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.988
He said you met someone.
Someone special.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.034
Who is she?

15:48.077 --> 15:50.427
Yeah, Nasha.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.995
Hmm, Nasha?Yeah.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.606
She's a schoolteacher.
You'd like her.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.699
Hey, you can't
blame yourself.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.266
All right, you leaving
had nothing to do

16:03.310 --> 16:04.267
with what's going on.

16:04.311 --> 16:05.355
He's right.
Jack's a big boy.

16:05.399 --> 16:06.922
He makes his own decisions.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.532
He'll be the first one
to tell you that.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.665
Yeah, but the last video
he sent me,

16:10.708 --> 16:12.493
I could see that
he wasn't in a good place,

16:12.536 --> 16:16.018
and, uh, I didn't respond.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.237
Why not?

16:17.280 --> 16:19.413
Because telling him
I'm not coming home

16:19.456 --> 16:21.806
wasn't what he wanted to hear.

16:26.986 --> 16:27.987
He hates me.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.380
He doesn't hate you.
He's just upset.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.992
You don't have to sugarcoat it
'cause I'm your superior.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.995
Okay, he hates you.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.300
But you did lie to him

16:37.344 --> 16:39.259
for the majority of his life.

16:39.302 --> 16:43.045
I can't decide if
you're speaking truth to power

16:43.089 --> 16:44.960
or being insubordinate.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.048
Can't it be both?

16:48.398 --> 16:51.010
It's just,
I-I thought that

16:51.053 --> 16:54.100
our reunion would be,
at the very least, civil.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.015
You know?

16:57.625 --> 16:58.930
It seems my son's
forgiveness

16:58.974 --> 17:01.585
is proving quite hard
to come by.

17:01.629 --> 17:04.893
All the more reason
to keep trying to earn it.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.597
Why are men like this
always surrounded by

17:13.641 --> 17:16.992
big scary guys
with big scary guns?

17:17.036 --> 17:18.863
Because it isn't
deep-frying potatoes.

17:18.907 --> 17:21.083
This is the big leagues.BOZER: Actually, sir,

17:21.127 --> 17:22.693
I used to fry potatoes,

17:22.737 --> 17:24.217
and it wasn't that easy.I know that.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.262
That's why I rejected
employing you... twice.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.265
The hell? Then
why am I here?

17:29.309 --> 17:31.441
Because Matilda Webber can't
take no for an answer.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.095
Not to interrupt
a pointless conversation,

17:33.139 --> 17:35.315
but can we get back to how
we're gonna separate Yaroslav

17:35.358 --> 17:37.143
from his muscle?

17:37.186 --> 17:38.361
We're not gonna
get to him.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.102
We're gonna wait for him
to come to us.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.427
Do you know who I am?

18:00.470 --> 18:03.169
Save the threats.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.518
Recognize this?

18:04.561 --> 18:07.216
It's a sat view of your
compound in the Ukraine.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.175
See this badass plane
right here?

18:09.218 --> 18:11.307
This is China's
J-20 stealth fighter.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.136
One of the only two
prototypes in existence.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.530
Which is interesting because
the Chinese government

18:16.573 --> 18:18.184
just lost one six months ago.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.055
No one knows who has it
or where it is.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.448
MacGYVER:
So you have a choice to make.

18:21.491 --> 18:22.623
Tell us what we want to know,

18:22.666 --> 18:26.235
or we can call the
Chinese government.

18:26.279 --> 18:27.758
What do you want to know?

18:27.802 --> 18:30.152
Roman Mareks has
contacted you 12 times

18:30.196 --> 18:31.545
in the last 24 hours.

18:31.588 --> 18:32.981
Why?

18:33.024 --> 18:35.026
Mareks wants to buy an army.

18:35.070 --> 18:38.117
I have 3,000 highly trained
mercenaries

18:38.160 --> 18:39.640
ready to deploy immediately.

18:39.683 --> 18:42.773
And just so I know, in case
I'm ever in the market,

18:42.817 --> 18:44.862
what will 3,000 highly trained
mercs set me back?

18:44.906 --> 18:46.516
$50 million.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.432
Mareks said he'd take them all.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.305
Said he'd reach out
when he had the funds.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.967
Matty, the good news is
we found Yaroslav

19:03.011 --> 19:04.273
and we broke Yaroslav.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.101
That's great.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.016
But it sounds like
there's bad news, too.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.844
Yeah. Mareks is shopping
for an army,

19:09.887 --> 19:11.715
and Yaroslav was gonna
sell him one.

19:11.759 --> 19:14.022
So, Mareks plans to overthrow
the current dictator,

19:14.065 --> 19:15.197
get his old job back.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.677
Apparently.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.287
It begs a few questions,
like what role does Jack have

19:18.331 --> 19:20.202
in any of this, and also,
how is a guy who just

19:20.246 --> 19:23.205
fled his country with nothing
gonna come up with $50 million?

19:23.249 --> 19:24.641
Actually, I can answer
both those questions.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.774
According to the
unredacted file,

19:26.817 --> 19:28.341
one of the parameters
of Jack's mission

19:28.384 --> 19:30.212
to overthrow Mareks

19:30.256 --> 19:32.214
was to steal
the dictator's fortune

19:32.258 --> 19:34.260
in uncut diamonds
from his palace,

19:34.303 --> 19:36.305
and hide them in country.Let me guess,

19:36.349 --> 19:37.872
the value of these stones
is $50 million?

19:37.915 --> 19:38.960
Actually,

19:39.003 --> 19:41.223
just north of $57 million.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.182
Jack is taking Mareks
to the diamonds.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.227
Which explains why
Mareks approached Jack,

19:45.271 --> 19:46.968
and how he was able
to afford this army.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.710
But that still doesn't explain
why Jack agreed to help him.

19:49.753 --> 19:51.494
No, it doesn't,
but it gets worse.

19:51.538 --> 19:55.411
Because three months after Jack
hid the diamonds in Belarus,

19:55.455 --> 20:00.503
the CIA sent in another team
of operatives to pull them out.

20:00.547 --> 20:02.331
Does Jack know he's taking
Mareks to a hiding spot

20:02.375 --> 20:03.637
that was cleared out
nine years ago?

20:03.680 --> 20:05.900
Unfortunately, he does not.

20:05.943 --> 20:07.684
That puts us on a tight clock.

20:07.728 --> 20:09.077
Once Mareks discovers

20:09.120 --> 20:11.079
his fortune is missing...He'll kill Jack.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.048
Uh, guys

20:24.092 --> 20:26.094
Sounds like antiaircraft fire.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.357
MATTY: Oleg Vadim,
Belarus's current dictator,

20:28.401 --> 20:31.186
just issued orders
to shoot you guys down.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.362
BOZER:
Look, Mac,

20:33.406 --> 20:34.842
you know I hate
second-guessing you,

20:34.885 --> 20:37.061
but are you sure
this is our best option?

20:37.105 --> 20:38.237
Unfortunately, Bozer,
it's our only option.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.977
Mareks is already in
Belarus, which means

20:40.021 --> 20:41.544
we're already way behind.
If we want to save Jack,

20:41.588 --> 20:42.937
we got to get
to the hiding spot first,

20:42.980 --> 20:45.069
which means infil
by land is out.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.549
We'd never catch up.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.294
Hey, guys,

20:52.338 --> 20:53.817
don't worry. We're
well above the range

20:53.861 --> 20:55.297
of their antiaircraft fire.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.081
I'm not worried about those
of us staying on the plane.

20:57.125 --> 20:58.692
I'm worried about
the two lunatics

20:58.735 --> 21:00.389
who are about to go...Bozer. We're gonna be fine.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.130
Promise.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.962
We're gonna be taking
fire the whole way down.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.094
To maximize our chances

21:10.138 --> 21:11.313
of actually reaching
the ground alive,

21:11.357 --> 21:13.489
don't deploy until
2,000 feet.

21:13.533 --> 21:16.013
That's not gonna make
for a very fun landing.That's true.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.102
But if we deploy too early,

21:18.146 --> 21:20.061
there won't be much
of us landing at all.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.868
♪

22:03.147 --> 22:04.975
OVERSIGHT:
I'm hit. Repeat, I'm hit.

22:05.019 --> 22:06.934
MacGYVER:
Okay, maybe Bozer was right.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.980
Only lunatics will jump
into a cross fire.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.988
I'm tangled up!
Can't pull my reserve!

22:31.088 --> 22:33.743
MacGYVER: As soon as I cut
your main, pull your reserve!

22:49.629 --> 22:51.413
Good job, Blondie.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.635
Son.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.034
RILEY: All right, guys.
Maintain your heading.

23:04.078 --> 23:05.296
You're almost there.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.472
It's just over
the next hill.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.875
Something wrong?

23:18.919 --> 23:20.224
We're not gonna talk
about what just happened?

23:20.268 --> 23:21.443
You already thanked
me for saving you.

23:21.487 --> 23:22.923
No, I tried to thank you.

23:22.966 --> 23:25.055
You hand me back my knife
and walk off.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.536
Where I come from,
that's called a brush-off.

23:27.580 --> 23:30.278
You mean a blow-off.Whatever.

23:30.321 --> 23:33.150
All I'm saying is,
ignoring me every time

23:33.194 --> 23:35.283
I try to engage with you
is getting a little tired.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.459
Okay.

23:37.503 --> 23:41.071
How about we find a way to
separate Jack from Mareks

23:41.115 --> 23:43.552
and then we go home
and never speak again?

23:43.596 --> 23:45.206
MATTY: Guys, this little
therapy session is gonna

23:45.249 --> 23:46.120
need to be put on hold.

23:46.163 --> 23:47.338
We're tracking a truck.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.166
It's headed your way.
Ten miles out.

23:49.210 --> 23:52.169
If you would like to save Jack,
you need to come up with a plan

23:52.213 --> 23:53.649
right now.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.651
Get Jack.

23:55.695 --> 23:57.261
I'll distract them.
Meet you at exfil.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.210
Mac. What are
you doing here?

24:35.038 --> 24:36.649
The CIA hid the diamonds
nine years ago,

24:36.692 --> 24:38.651
so if you go into that church,
Mareks is gonna kill you.

24:38.694 --> 24:40.566
Seriously?
Yeah.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.090
Okay, well, that is
the last thing

24:43.133 --> 24:45.266
on my list of stuff
I want to have happen today.

24:45.309 --> 24:47.921
What's the plan?Get the hell out of here.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.400
Yeah, lead the way.

24:55.450 --> 24:56.538
Mac is back!

24:56.582 --> 24:58.061
You have no earthly idea
how good it is

24:58.105 --> 24:59.541
to see you again, homie.

24:59.585 --> 25:01.500
Yeah, feeling's mutual,
pal, but I got to ask you,

25:01.543 --> 25:03.066
this working with Mareks,
what's that about?

25:03.110 --> 25:05.329
Uh, it's complicated.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.766
That's a terrible answer.It's the truth.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.681
And I'll be honest with you,
it's been a dark few months

25:08.724 --> 25:10.291
not having you
around, brother.

25:10.334 --> 25:11.858
You've really brightened
my day here.

25:49.504 --> 25:52.333
He lied.

25:52.376 --> 25:54.683
Dalton.

25:54.727 --> 25:57.120
Dalton. Dalton,
I know you can hear me.

25:57.164 --> 26:00.689
Yo, Mareks. How goes
the diamond hunting there, kid?

26:00.733 --> 26:02.082
You know they are not here.

26:02.125 --> 26:03.083
Yeah, I know.

26:03.126 --> 26:04.084
It kind of sucks
for you, huh?

26:04.127 --> 26:05.128
Coming all this way
for nothing?

26:05.172 --> 26:06.347
Dalton, when I find you...

26:06.390 --> 26:07.609
You'll do what?
You'll do what, huh?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.698
You'll bend over
and kiss my keister?

26:09.742 --> 26:11.439
Pucker up, tough guy.
You're a loser.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.745
And by the way,
the deal's off,

26:12.788 --> 26:15.269
so adios.

26:15.312 --> 26:18.577
Dalton! Dalton!

26:22.537 --> 26:24.365
Where is he?
I-I don't know.

26:24.408 --> 26:25.975
Are you sure
this is the spot?

26:26.019 --> 26:27.934
Yeah, this is the dropped pin.
This is, this is exfil.

26:27.977 --> 26:29.500
He should be here by now.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.068
Yeah, only one slight little
problem, dude, he isn't.

26:32.112 --> 26:35.028
We've wasted too much time.
Let's get out of here.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.595
Are we really just gonna
leave without him?

26:36.638 --> 26:38.727
Come on, man.
At least give him a call.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.773
Go on.

26:43.036 --> 26:45.734
Yeah. Where are you?

26:45.778 --> 26:47.214
OLEG:
He's with me.

26:47.257 --> 26:49.651
And soon...

26:49.695 --> 26:50.739
you will be, too.

26:50.783 --> 26:52.654
And you will
learn the penalty

26:52.698 --> 26:54.656
for trespassing
in my country,

26:54.700 --> 26:55.701
whoever you are.

26:55.744 --> 26:58.486
Hey, hey, this is
Oleg Vadim, right?

26:58.529 --> 27:01.315
Uh, Jack Dalton here.
Nice to meet you.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.969
I'm the guy that deposed
Mareks for you.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.666
No reason to thank me.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.450
You're welcome. You know,

27:06.494 --> 27:08.670
I was kind of thinking
since I'm the only reason

27:08.714 --> 27:10.454
you're even in power
in the first place,

27:10.498 --> 27:12.500
maybe you could
do us a solid

27:12.543 --> 27:13.893
and-and not kill our friend.
Sound good?

27:15.416 --> 27:16.765
That wasn't supposed
to be a joke.

27:16.809 --> 27:17.810
Vadim, what do you want?

27:17.853 --> 27:19.463
There will be no deals.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.815
Enemy combatants who trespass
into Belarus are executed

27:22.858 --> 27:25.687
without exception,
which means

27:25.731 --> 27:27.646
I'm going to kill
your friend.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.737
Look, Vadim, I'll
make this simple.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.914
You turn over our
friend unharmed

27:34.957 --> 27:38.308
and we'll give you
Roman Mareks.

27:38.352 --> 27:39.701
Roman Mareks is dead.

27:39.745 --> 27:40.876
JACK:
No, no, no, no.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.008
That's where you're
wrong there, homeboy.

27:42.051 --> 27:43.923
Mareks is very much
alive and well.

27:43.966 --> 27:47.709
And he's currently planning
o-on buying an army

27:47.753 --> 27:50.364
of mercenaries to drop
by your palace, say hello,

27:50.407 --> 27:52.192
spill your blood
and get his old job back.

27:52.235 --> 27:55.195
You're lying.No, no, no.

27:55.238 --> 27:57.676
I'm not lying.
Check the news.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.852
That Russian depot
that was just raided?

27:59.895 --> 28:01.767
That was Mareks
a-and his boys stealing guns.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.159
Lots and lots of guns.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.944
When Mareks gets that army
to go with those guns,

28:04.987 --> 28:06.380
how long do you
think it's gonna be

28:06.423 --> 28:07.947
before he's knocking
at your door?

28:07.990 --> 28:10.253
The good news is,
none of that has to happen

28:10.297 --> 28:13.648
because we can deliver
Mareks wrapped in a bow.

28:18.784 --> 28:21.743
You bring me Mareks
in two hours.

28:21.787 --> 28:25.704
I'll send coordinates
for the handoff to this phone.

28:25.747 --> 28:29.403
But mark my words,
you try anything,

28:29.446 --> 28:33.755
your friend will die
a very painful death.

28:33.799 --> 28:35.844
JACK:
Very painful. Got it. Thanks.

28:35.888 --> 28:37.890
Bye. Well, he's about
as charming as Mareks.

28:37.933 --> 28:38.934
Matty, Bozer,
you get all that?

28:38.978 --> 28:40.414
Yeah, Mac.

28:40.457 --> 28:41.981
We heard everything.Us, too.

28:42.024 --> 28:44.548
Mac, uh, you just agreed to
trade Mareks for Oversight,

28:44.592 --> 28:46.768
which is great but
for one little problem.MacGYVER: Yeah, I know.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.465
I know.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.380
We just got to catch him
before he flees Belarus.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.208
Where is he now?

28:52.252 --> 28:54.210
RILEY: He just passed
the city of Orsha.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.734
Heading east towards
the Russian border.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.736
JACK: Wait, wait. Hey, wait.
Check out that bridge

28:57.779 --> 28:59.607
right there.
He's gonna have to cross that

28:59.650 --> 29:01.130
if he's gonna make it
to exfil in Russia.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.741
Yeah. A bridge is
a good choke point.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.264
Oh, yeah.MATTY: Only one problem.

29:04.307 --> 29:06.266
That particular bridge
just happens to be

29:06.309 --> 29:07.876
one of Oleg Vadim's
military checkpoints.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.791
Which means it'll be guarded.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.488
If Vadim gets his hands
on Mareks before we do...

29:11.532 --> 29:13.273
The deal will be off
and your dad will be...

29:13.316 --> 29:15.231
Dead. I did the math.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.804
Four soldiers
on the bridge that I count.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.023
JACK:
Yeah, all right.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.459
All right, we're gonna
need to deal with them

29:25.502 --> 29:26.895
before Mareks arrives

29:26.939 --> 29:29.419
or these guys are gonna
call Vadim and this place

29:29.463 --> 29:31.160
will turn into a big ole pie
fight; we'll never get Mareks.Yeah.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.249
So, how you want
to handle this

29:33.293 --> 29:34.511
Any ideas?

29:36.905 --> 29:40.604
What would your friendly
neighborhood Spider

29:42.084 --> 29:43.869
Crawl along the bottom
of the bridge.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.827
Attack from below
with his webbing.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.960
Is that what we're gonna do?

29:48.003 --> 29:49.004
All except for the webbing.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.485
Wait.
I wasn't serious, man.

29:51.528 --> 29:52.921
Well, I was.

30:01.887 --> 30:03.540
Hey. Hey.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.934
Could you
give me that wire?

30:05.978 --> 30:08.807
Okay, so, Spider-Man
would already be

30:08.850 --> 30:10.983
on the bridge by now,
but give me a break.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.506
His wrists shoot
synthetic webbing

30:12.549 --> 30:14.073
with a tensile
strength and elasticity

30:14.116 --> 30:16.292
that defies the laws
of chemistry and physics...

30:16.336 --> 30:17.816
and biology.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.079
My point is,
a mechanical ascender

30:20.122 --> 30:22.124
with a blocking system
is the next best thing.

30:22.168 --> 30:26.389
It may be slower than Spidey,
but it'll get the job done.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.391
You got to admit you missed
the hell out of this,

30:28.435 --> 30:29.610
didn't you

30:29.653 --> 30:30.829
You and me
doing something

30:30.872 --> 30:33.657
incredibly stupid
and dangerous

30:33.701 --> 30:35.224
that'll probably
get us both killed.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.313
I know I have.You really think
that's helping?

30:37.357 --> 30:39.315
Probably not.

30:39.359 --> 30:41.317
Okay, sorry, yeah.

30:41.361 --> 30:43.885
I'm just really happy.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.626
Okay, that's great,
but I want you to be helpful,

30:45.669 --> 30:48.020
so, uh, hand me
that wheel right there.Yeah.

31:32.238 --> 31:33.456
MacGYVER:
Matty, bridge is secure.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.023
Just in time.
You got Mareks approaching.

33:32.749 --> 33:35.013
♪

34:14.008 --> 34:16.097
MacGYVER:
Save Jack or stop Mareks?

34:16.141 --> 34:17.620
That's not even a choice.

34:53.091 --> 34:54.222
Mac?

34:55.267 --> 34:57.225
:
You lunatic.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.450
What

35:07.540 --> 35:09.933
:
I'm alive.

35:09.977 --> 35:10.934
You're alive.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.153
You know, after Cairo,

35:12.197 --> 35:13.676
I feel like I'm playing
with house money.

35:13.720 --> 35:15.765
Well, eventually, your
luck's gonna run out.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.072
Yeah, well,
not when I have you around.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.508
Apparently.

35:25.210 --> 35:26.254
Hey, Matty,

35:26.298 --> 35:29.170
Jack is safe,
but Mareks got away.

35:29.214 --> 35:31.738
Did he? Leanna.

35:31.781 --> 35:34.175
No, ma'am.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.524
MATTY:
Leanna, take your passenger

35:35.568 --> 35:36.743
to the coordinates

35:36.786 --> 35:38.875
I sent, hand him
over to Vadim,

35:38.919 --> 35:41.182
and then get back Oversight.

35:41.226 --> 35:43.141
Copy that.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.145
So it's over?

35:48.798 --> 35:50.974
All right, bud,
now you can tell me,

35:51.018 --> 35:52.324
what were you doing
working with Mareks

35:52.367 --> 35:53.542
in the first place?

35:53.586 --> 35:55.022
Oh, well, I wasn't trying to.

35:55.065 --> 35:57.416
A-At first, I was on
a whole 'nother mission.

35:57.459 --> 35:58.721
Which was?

35:58.765 --> 36:01.202
Oh, I was gonna hunt down
and capture Walsh.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.465
Yeah, I-I kind of figured

36:03.509 --> 36:05.989
if I collared your old man's
ex-partner, I don't know,

36:06.033 --> 36:07.295
he'd just retire.

36:07.339 --> 36:09.863
And-and then you could
return to the Phoenix.

36:09.906 --> 36:13.127
Okay, actually, I-I get that,

36:13.171 --> 36:15.260
but how does Mareks
fit in to all this?

36:15.303 --> 36:17.218
Before I found Walsh,
Mareks found me.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.133
So you decided to work for him?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.048
He showed me pictures of you
in Nigeria, dude.

36:21.091 --> 36:23.268
He knew where you were, and
he said if I didn't help him

36:23.311 --> 36:24.617
get back his
$50 million,

36:24.660 --> 36:26.096
he was gonna send
somebody down there

36:26.140 --> 36:27.185
and turn your
lights out.

36:29.099 --> 36:32.059
You agreed to, uh,
work with him to save my life?

36:32.102 --> 36:34.801
Eh, more or less,
but then I realized,

36:34.844 --> 36:36.759
I could turn lemonade
into lemons.

36:36.803 --> 36:37.978
You know what
I'm saying? I mean,

36:38.021 --> 36:39.197
for the first time
in my life,

36:39.240 --> 36:40.372
I could see ten moves

36:40.415 --> 36:42.112
in front of me.
I-I knew that

36:42.156 --> 36:45.246
if pictures of me working for
Mareks got out in the world,

36:45.290 --> 36:47.509
then Phoenix
would see that,

36:47.553 --> 36:49.294
and they'd realize
I was in trouble and...

36:49.337 --> 36:51.165
They'd send Oversight to get me.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.820
Exactly, yeah.

36:53.863 --> 36:56.039
Exactly. You know,

36:56.083 --> 36:59.304
you did save
my life, pal,

36:59.347 --> 37:01.044
but I could argue that

37:01.088 --> 37:02.263
I'm saving yours as well.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.397
Rescued you from
a life of misery,

37:05.440 --> 37:07.268
wasting your talents.

37:07.312 --> 37:10.010
Hey, hey, I'm serious, man,
the world needs you, Mac.

37:10.053 --> 37:12.317
And you owe it to the world
to work for the Phoenix.

37:12.360 --> 37:15.320
You need to put this personal
BS with your old man

37:15.363 --> 37:17.365
to the side
and realize

37:17.409 --> 37:19.193
this is exactly where
you're supposed to be,

37:19.237 --> 37:21.500
on the razor's edge
with your boy,

37:21.543 --> 37:23.328
cheating death.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.596
Oh, and you missed this
a little bit, didn't you?

37:30.639 --> 37:34.208
Huh?Yeah, I did.

37:56.274 --> 37:59.451
Good to see you
still alive, Jim.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.191
Good to still
be alive, Matty.

38:01.235 --> 38:03.542
Thanks to Angus.

38:03.585 --> 38:06.327
I can't tell you how many times
I've heard that before,

38:06.371 --> 38:09.635
appreciation for your son
saving someone's life.

38:09.678 --> 38:12.333
You trained him well.

38:12.377 --> 38:17.120
No, Jim. All we did
is point him in a direction.

38:17.164 --> 38:19.688
I can train operatives
to work in the field,

38:19.732 --> 38:22.517
and I can train operatives
to work as a part of a team,

38:22.561 --> 38:25.346
but I can't train operatives
to do what he does.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.478
And without him,

38:26.521 --> 38:28.262
the Phoenix just isn't running

38:28.306 --> 38:29.437
at its full potential.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.570
I agree.

38:31.613 --> 38:34.790
That's why I hope we can
sit down and talk with him.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.663
Frankly, I don't think
that's gonna be enough.

38:38.794 --> 38:40.840
There's a lot of baggage
between you two.

38:40.883 --> 38:44.365
Baggage that he might not
be willing to ignore,

38:44.409 --> 38:46.585
or forgive.

38:46.628 --> 38:49.892
Are you asking me to quit?

38:51.807 --> 38:56.421
I'm asking you to think beyond
yourself and your feelings,

38:56.464 --> 38:59.424
to think of the greater good,
of the Phoenix.

38:59.467 --> 39:01.469
Advice that
you've given me

39:01.513 --> 39:02.427
many times.

39:04.472 --> 39:07.867
Well, I agree
that we need Angus,

39:07.910 --> 39:10.391
and if it comes to that, then...

39:10.435 --> 39:13.133
I'll make the necessary
arrangements.

39:13.176 --> 39:15.483
Good. I'm glad
to hear that.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.790
There's one more thing,
and you're not gonna like it.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.663
You owe Jack an apology
for thinking that he flipped.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.362
Not to mention,
a debt of gratitude

39:24.405 --> 39:26.233
for helping to save your life.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.852
Where's Angus?

39:41.248 --> 39:42.684
Careful, babe,
you smile any harder

39:42.728 --> 39:43.903
you're gonna
hurt yourself.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.470
I can't help but smile wide.

39:45.513 --> 39:47.820
My girl's full of surprises.
I had no idea you could fly.

39:47.863 --> 39:50.257
You're like Bruce Lee
with a pilot's license.

39:50.300 --> 39:51.824
My uncle taught me.

39:51.867 --> 39:53.913
He had a farm, he needed
help crop-dusting.

39:53.956 --> 39:57.395
That is hot. Hot!

39:58.439 --> 40:01.355
Here you go. Yeah.Thank you.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.662
Where's Mac?

40:03.705 --> 40:06.621
Uh, he's not
coming, Bozer.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.058
He's not coming
for now, or...?

40:09.102 --> 40:10.408
He's going back to Nigeria.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.583
BOZER:
Wait, no, Mac wouldn't

40:11.626 --> 40:13.019
just up and leave
without a good-bye.

40:13.062 --> 40:14.324
JACK:
Oh, he left a good-bye.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.978
It was, uh, oh,
it was just in writing.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.154
He-he left a note

40:18.198 --> 40:20.635
that said that he didn't want
to say good-bye again in person

40:20.679 --> 40:22.942
'cause...

40:22.985 --> 40:26.424
well, 'cause it hurt
too much last time,

40:26.467 --> 40:28.774
so...

40:37.130 --> 40:38.914
I'm happy to report
that my friend Jack Dalton

40:38.958 --> 40:40.786
is safe and sound, so...

40:40.829 --> 40:44.311
That is so good to hear.

40:44.354 --> 40:46.052
Uh, what about your father?

40:46.095 --> 40:47.575
Did you guys have
any chance to talk?

40:47.619 --> 40:49.403
No, we were kind of busy, so...

40:49.447 --> 40:52.537
But you can sit down now, right?

40:52.580 --> 40:54.843
Well, no, actually, I can't

40:54.887 --> 40:56.584
'cause I got
a little flight to catch.

40:56.628 --> 40:58.760
You're coming back!

40:58.804 --> 41:01.110
: Yeah.
It's where my home is now.

41:01.154 --> 41:03.504
Excuse me,
Angus MacGyver?

41:03.548 --> 41:06.464
Yeah.
I was told
to give this to you.

41:06.507 --> 41:07.639
By who?

41:15.734 --> 41:18.345
Call airport security, now.

41:18.388 --> 41:21.130
We X-rayed it.

41:21.174 --> 41:23.002
There's a phone inside.

41:37.451 --> 41:38.583
JILL:
Hello?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.196
Jill?

41:43.239 --> 41:44.980
Hey, Mac, what's...

41:45.024 --> 41:46.286
going on I...

41:46.329 --> 41:47.809
I don't know, you tell me.
I just got a phone

41:47.853 --> 41:49.550
delivered with your number.Where are you?

41:49.594 --> 41:51.944
Heard you've been
looking for me.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.902
Mac!Jill?

41:53.946 --> 41:57.515
Jill. Jill!

42:01.083 --> 42:05.566
I'm sorry.
Jill is unavailable right now,

42:05.610 --> 42:07.133
or ever again.

42:07.176 --> 42:08.830
But let's not cry
over spilled milk

42:08.874 --> 42:11.267
or blood, shall we?

42:12.442 --> 42:14.880
Can I just say how good it is

42:14.923 --> 42:17.099
to hear your voice again, Angus.

42:17.143 --> 42:19.101
Someone told me
you're back in town.

42:19.145 --> 42:23.671
I really do hope we can see each
other before you leave again.
