WEBVTT

00:44.550 --> 00:47.052
Can I just say how proud
I am of the four of us?

00:47.136 --> 00:50.014
I mean, we were such adults in there.

00:50.097 --> 00:51.181
[elevator bell dings]

00:51.265 --> 00:54.560
I think we should thank Bud for
suggesting that we use an arbitrator.

00:54.644 --> 00:57.688
Thank you, Bud. Jerry
was the perfect choice,

00:57.772 --> 01:01.358
fair, sensitive, kind, and I think
he brought out the best in us.

01:01.442 --> 01:03.527
- And now that the papers are signed...
- Shut up, Sol.

01:03.611 --> 01:04.779
Yeah.

01:08.825 --> 01:10.827
Your father's right, Nwabudike.

01:10.910 --> 01:13.621
We didn't know how to handle
this but somehow you did.

01:13.704 --> 01:15.539
- Yes, thank you, Bud.
- Thank you.

01:15.623 --> 01:17.541
Stop! Please stop.

01:17.625 --> 01:19.961
- What the... hell?
- [elevator shuts off]

01:21.211 --> 01:22.964
- We're not moving!
- [Robert] That's okay, Grace.

01:23.047 --> 01:24.924
I'm sure it'll start up again in a second.

01:26.175 --> 01:27.969
- [woman] Can I help you?
- I hope so.

01:28.052 --> 01:32.473
We are in an elevator that
is temporarily standing still.

01:32.556 --> 01:35.100
Robert, say the word... we're stuck!

01:35.184 --> 01:36.560
No need to use that word yet.

01:36.644 --> 01:39.814
The word "stuck"? It's just a
word, it's better than "trapped".

01:39.897 --> 01:42.859
- Oh, God!
- She's claustrophobic.

01:42.942 --> 01:45.611
- Hello, hello!
- [Robert] Calm down, please, Grace.

01:45.695 --> 01:49.073
- There's no air in here.
- There is air! [inhales sharply]

01:49.156 --> 01:51.367
Well, why isn't it going into my lungs?

01:51.450 --> 01:54.620
It's just anxiety, Grace. Why
don't you tell your anxiety,

01:54.704 --> 01:56.873
"Hey there, anxiety, I'm not
going to let you rule me."

01:56.956 --> 01:59.166
Because my anxiety
doesn't give a flying fuck!

01:59.249 --> 02:01.377
Don't you have a Valium?
You always carry Valium.

02:01.460 --> 02:03.671
- I took two before the meeting.
- Then you should be fine.

02:03.754 --> 02:06.090
I said I took two pills, not two handfuls.

02:06.173 --> 02:08.884
No, no. Grace, look at me. Focus on me.

02:08.967 --> 02:12.930
Let me be your Valium. I'm Frankie Valium.

02:13.014 --> 02:15.641
- Who was also a singer in the '60's.
- I need more air.

02:15.725 --> 02:18.602
- I need air.
- Oh, oh. We've got you!

02:18.686 --> 02:21.271
- Easy, easy.
- I've got pot gummies. Eat this.

02:21.355 --> 02:23.566
- No, no!
- I need one, I need one. Me, me, me.

02:23.649 --> 02:26.360
- What's going on with you, Bud?
- God! There's less air down here.

02:26.443 --> 02:28.404
I have to stand up. You
all have to sit down.

02:30.656 --> 02:32.742
Honey, are you having a panic attack?

02:32.825 --> 02:34.451
Maybe, a little... A little bit.

02:34.535 --> 02:37.038
- You claustrophobic, too?
- Actually, no.

02:37.121 --> 02:40.332
- Wait, didn't this happen once before?
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

02:40.416 --> 02:42.209
That weekend before he started at the firm.

02:42.292 --> 02:44.962
- That's almost five years ago.
- Was that Memorial Day?

02:45.046 --> 02:46.714
- Labor Day.
- Labor Day.

02:47.423 --> 02:50.760
Happy Labor Day weekend, union supporters.

02:50.843 --> 02:53.721
- Viva la vega!
- Are those grapes?

02:53.804 --> 02:55.389
For Cesar Chavez.

02:55.472 --> 02:58.434
Don't you know anything about the
labor movement in this country?

02:58.517 --> 03:02.312
Guys, where's the coffee?
Communist cake is served.

03:05.357 --> 03:07.902
It's better that we're doing this together.

03:07.985 --> 03:11.614
- I don't know.
- Just let me do the talking.

03:11.697 --> 03:14.283
Sol, trust me.

03:22.583 --> 03:25.419
The trouble with your socialist
dessert is it's very rich.

03:27.671 --> 03:28.798
It's a joke.

03:29.757 --> 03:31.508
It's just good you're trying.

03:33.218 --> 03:35.345
Sol and I want to talk
to you about something...

03:35.429 --> 03:36.931
You know what'd make the joke better

03:37.014 --> 03:40.184
is if you had made it about the
equal distribution of cake slices.

03:40.267 --> 03:41.560
Oh, yeah, that's a riot.

03:41.644 --> 03:45.773
You see, a few years back Sol and I
were in New York on a business trip,

03:45.856 --> 03:47.984
and it was a pretty big deal for us.

03:48.067 --> 03:51.654
We stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria, and
you know, we finished all our business...

03:51.737 --> 03:54.115
Yoo-hoo, big, fat whale on the loose.

03:54.198 --> 03:55.282
- [Grace] Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mom.

03:55.365 --> 03:56.826
Hi, kids.

03:56.909 --> 04:01.205
Look at you, radiant, pregnant woman. Mmm.

04:01.288 --> 04:04.416
Sol, get your ass up here and
get a piece of the wonder of life.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.960
Hi.

04:06.043 --> 04:08.754
I thought they were going to
Mitch's parents' for the weekend.

04:08.838 --> 04:10.840
Yeah, to drop off Macklin.

04:10.923 --> 04:12.842
Everybody's coming here, it's Labor Day.

04:12.925 --> 04:14.969
Hello, little baby. This
is your Aunt Frankie.

04:15.052 --> 04:17.012
Does this little bumpkin have a name yet?

04:17.096 --> 04:19.473
She's not telling anyone.
Believe me, I've tried.

04:19.555 --> 04:22.810
Hello, little baby, you're so good. Gladys?

04:22.893 --> 04:24.979
- No.
- Ursula?

04:25.062 --> 04:27.148
Stargazer Vera?

04:27.231 --> 04:30.400
- Frankie?
- All good ideas. Pool time for me.

04:30.484 --> 04:33.237
[sings]

04:36.532 --> 04:39.118
I'm going to make you a big, fat smoothie.

04:39.202 --> 04:42.454
[continues singing]

04:42.538 --> 04:44.748
[laughs]

04:44.832 --> 04:47.501
I see pregnant women
at the office every day

04:47.584 --> 04:50.213
and none of them are as
excited as Frankie, ever.

04:50.295 --> 04:55.134
Well, she never got to do
it herself, so, it's special.

04:56.552 --> 04:59.222
Robert, you and Sol are gonna
have to do the sauce ASAP,

04:59.304 --> 05:02.349
because it's gonna take at least three
hours for the chicken to marinate,

05:02.432 --> 05:06.187
and I still have to get the corn
on and start my shucking at three.

05:06.270 --> 05:09.106
And where will I be, sergeant, at 0400?

05:09.190 --> 05:11.067
At the cutting board,
you're doing the salad.

05:11.150 --> 05:14.778
- And what if we eat at 7:10?
- Then we have failed.

05:15.612 --> 05:17.531
[cell phone ringing]

05:17.614 --> 05:20.617
- Let me guess, work.
- I'll keep it short, Robert.

05:20.701 --> 05:22.536
I promise I won't work this weekend.

05:23.996 --> 05:25.289
Hello?

05:25.372 --> 05:28.167
You get him on the phone right
now and I'll take care of it.

05:28.251 --> 05:30.794
It's no big deal, Robert. I
won't miss my shucking time.

05:30.878 --> 05:32.337
Phew!

05:32.421 --> 05:34.965
She works too hard, even weekends.

05:35.049 --> 05:37.176
Nah, it's fine, Frankie.
It's what she loves.

05:37.260 --> 05:41.055
Not me. Life's too short,
unless you drink my smoothies.

05:41.138 --> 05:44.058
I'm good with my life expectancy.

05:46.518 --> 05:49.105
- How you feeling, babe?
- You know what?

05:49.188 --> 05:51.315
- Better than I have felt in months.
- Yeah?

05:51.398 --> 05:53.525
Yep. I was feeling a
little nauseous earlier,

05:53.609 --> 05:56.820
then I swallowed some pool water...
Thank you. I think it settled my stomach.

05:56.904 --> 05:58.781
Whatever works. How are the contractions?

05:58.864 --> 06:02.534
Mitch, stop. I'm not in
labor. It's just Braxton-Hicks.

06:02.618 --> 06:06.455
- Okay, I know, but just let me know.
- I know, I know.

06:06.538 --> 06:07.790
OK, please stop worrying.

06:07.873 --> 06:11.418
I'm not going to spend another 37 hours
at the hospital like we did with Macklin.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.837
- Not happening.
- But we did the giant puzzle

06:13.921 --> 06:16.173
of the covered bridge in winter.

06:16.257 --> 06:18.301
- Aw, hey, stud.
- Hey.

06:18.383 --> 06:21.386
- How was your big date last night?
- Aw, it was good.

06:21.470 --> 06:22.471
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:22.554 --> 06:27.226
- You still dating the Zumba instructor?
- No. This one I met at a stop light...

06:27.310 --> 06:29.394
Laura. Lauren?

06:29.478 --> 06:31.230
Laurel.

06:31.314 --> 06:32.315
Maybe Meg.

06:32.356 --> 06:34.984
- [both laughing]
- Where's the Mack attack, huh?

06:35.067 --> 06:37.402
He's attacking his other
grandma and grandpa this weekend.

06:37.486 --> 06:40.156
Oh, really? I got him
this really cool playhouse.

06:40.239 --> 06:42.992
Why is it that people are
always getting the kids presents?

06:43.075 --> 06:45.828
- We're the ones who need them.
- Oh, don't worry.

06:45.911 --> 06:48.831
- I got you something, too.
- Oh, yeah?

06:48.914 --> 06:51.041
Wait, is it weed?

06:51.125 --> 06:53.210
Oh, boy! Beat it!

06:53.294 --> 06:55.296
All right.

06:58.382 --> 07:02.136
- What the hell are you wearing?
- Hm? Ohhh. [chuckles]

07:02.219 --> 07:07.016
It's Vilebrequin. Their swimsuits
have the St. Tropez spirit.

07:07.099 --> 07:09.852
Hmm, fancy. You gonna wear
that on your first day of work?

07:09.935 --> 07:11.354
I might.

07:11.436 --> 07:14.648
I guess you can do whatever you
want now that your daddy's the boss.

07:14.731 --> 07:17.193
And your dad, too. It's the best gig ever.

07:17.276 --> 07:18.902
How's your work going?

07:18.986 --> 07:21.238
- Okay. What happened?
- Nothing!

07:21.322 --> 07:24.158
I'm beating the market by
15%, so that's really good.

07:24.241 --> 07:26.118
- And?
- And...

07:26.202 --> 07:28.704
I may have sent an email
to my boss about my boss

07:28.787 --> 07:30.414
in which I called him dumber than fuck.

07:30.497 --> 07:33.792
[laughing] And in your world he would
appreciate that e-mail because...

07:33.876 --> 07:35.294
I was right and he was wrong,

07:35.378 --> 07:38.714
and I told him over and over that Dell was
doomed and we had to get our clients out,

07:38.797 --> 07:41.967
and then the market value dropped from
16 billion to 9 in less than a year.

07:42.051 --> 07:43.177
I rest my case.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.012
But you understand bosses don't like it

07:45.095 --> 07:47.223
when an underling calls
them dumber than fuck.

07:47.306 --> 07:51.352
I totally get that. It's just my
feeling is don't be dumber than fuck.

07:51.435 --> 07:53.562
- Ow.
- Ah. [grunts]

07:53.645 --> 07:55.814
Bud's sleeping on the couch tonight!

07:55.898 --> 07:57.774
I have to speak to Martin Costa.

07:57.858 --> 08:01.820
Look, I just received an entire shipment
of squirt tops that don't squirt.

08:01.904 --> 08:06.450
Squirt tops that don't squirt are...
They're just tops, do you see my problem?

08:06.533 --> 08:08.869
- Yes, I will hold.
- [blender whirring]

08:08.952 --> 08:13.165
- Frankie! I'm on the phone.
- Sorry, it's a pulse.

08:13.249 --> 08:15.376
I'm making Mallory a honey-mannuka shake.

08:15.459 --> 08:18.545
It's healthy and delicious. I
don't want to bruise the chard.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.505
She's not going to drink that.

08:20.589 --> 08:22.841
Ugh, sorry. Nobody's going
to want to drink that.

08:22.925 --> 08:25.177
Besides, she only drinks
Ovaltine when she's pregnant.

08:25.261 --> 08:28.972
Oh, and KFC gravy... Not on my watch.

08:29.056 --> 08:32.517
It's a natural probiotic.
The ancient Egyptians used it.

08:34.019 --> 08:39.232
Frankie, just because I'm on hold
doesn't mean I'm not on the phone.

08:39.316 --> 08:42.611
I need to hear if someone on
the other end of the line speaks.

08:42.693 --> 08:46.282
As much as I enjoy having you
explain to me how phones work,

08:46.365 --> 08:48.575
I have a pregnant woman to take care of.

08:48.658 --> 08:51.578
Hello?

08:51.661 --> 08:52.955
I've been disconnected.

08:53.038 --> 08:56.250
Imagine... and with all
your knowledge of phones.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.335
[sighs]

08:58.419 --> 09:00.754
I can't believe it didn't
happen after all that buildup.

09:00.837 --> 09:03.048
Robert, we're lucky. We dodged a bullet.

09:03.132 --> 09:06.969
Can you imagine if we told them and
your daughter and Mitch walked in?

09:07.052 --> 09:08.678
We'd be the biggest assholes ever.

09:08.762 --> 09:11.056
Either way, we're going to
be the biggest assholes ever,

09:11.140 --> 09:12.349
it's just a question of when.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.184
What about the end of September?

09:14.268 --> 09:17.146
I can't do the end of September. It's
Rosh Hashanah. It's late this year.

09:17.229 --> 09:19.482
- Isn't it always late?
- No. Sometimes it's early.

09:19.523 --> 09:21.733
All right. Then definitely October.

09:21.817 --> 09:25.028
Definitely, but Frankie's
birthday is October 12th...

09:25.112 --> 09:28.282
Okay, okay. We need to look at a calendar.

09:31.660 --> 09:34.163
- November.
- Thanksgiving. Forget it.

09:34.246 --> 09:36.915
We have all those people
over. She makes tofurkey.

09:36.999 --> 09:39.418
Sol, I know this isn't easy for you,

09:39.502 --> 09:42.254
but we will never be together
if we don't pick a day.

09:42.338 --> 09:45.424
- You're right.
- All right. Then let's look at December.

09:45.508 --> 09:48.093
Oh... Frankie's mother died in December.

09:48.177 --> 09:50.304
- It's always a very tough month for her.
- [groans]

09:52.222 --> 09:56.143
What is going on in here? You're
supposed to be making the marinade.

09:56.226 --> 09:57.602
[stammering]

09:57.686 --> 10:00.564
- We were just trying to pick a date.
- For what?

10:00.689 --> 10:04.818
A trip... a cruise...
to Alaska... on a ship.

10:04.901 --> 10:07.363
Is that what you guys wanted
to talk about this morning?

10:07.446 --> 10:10.115
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

10:10.199 --> 10:11.783
Well, December is out, right?

10:11.867 --> 10:15.245
January we have two fundraisers
and that charity museum gala, and...

10:15.329 --> 10:18.915
Let's just do this after
you've marinated the chicken.

10:18.999 --> 10:21.710
Great. We'll plan our trip then.

10:21.793 --> 10:26.131
You know what? I'll
marinate the chicken myself.

10:26.215 --> 10:29.634
Robert, would you at least get
the ice from the other freezer?

10:29.718 --> 10:32.471
- We have another freezer?
- In the garage.

10:33.805 --> 10:36.141
Alaska in January?

10:36.225 --> 10:38.268
I cracked.

10:46.151 --> 10:48.695
Want to build a house?

10:49.613 --> 10:51.031
[laughing]

10:51.114 --> 10:53.116
We should... we should
look at the directions.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.785
No! No. Directions are bullshit.

10:55.869 --> 10:58.914
You know what, you're right.
They are condescending.

10:58.997 --> 11:02.751
- [laughs]
- I... I know what'll help here.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.669
Yeah.

11:04.753 --> 11:07.172
- Here.
- Ah, oh, no thanks.

11:07.256 --> 11:09.007
- No?
- [laughs]

11:11.968 --> 11:13.220
All right. All right.

11:13.303 --> 11:14.471
Is this like one of those things

11:14.555 --> 11:16.557
that comes with its own
little wrench? [snorts]

11:16.640 --> 11:19.351
[both] Wrench, wrench, wrench,
wrench, wrench, wrench, wrench.

11:19.435 --> 11:21.686
[laughing] One more time.

11:21.770 --> 11:26.775
Wre-n-n-n-ch.

11:28.485 --> 11:29.570
Ah, that's nice.

11:29.653 --> 11:32.406
Cynthia, this is not about resin ID codes.

11:32.489 --> 11:35.784
It's about the breakdown
in your inspection services.

11:35.867 --> 11:38.078
I need to speak to Martin.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.956
Yeah, I know he's in Singapore,
and it's a holiday weekend...

11:41.039 --> 11:42.666
It's not a holiday weekend in Singapore.

11:42.749 --> 11:46.670
Not a holiday weekend in
Singapore. Thank you, Cynthia.

11:46.753 --> 11:50.340
Thank you, Brianna. She's
going to get him, finally.

11:50.424 --> 11:53.718
Oh, I'm so sorry about all this. I
really wanted to be with you this weekend.

11:53.802 --> 11:55.887
Mom, you have a work
thing. It's no big deal.

11:55.971 --> 11:58.098
Yeah. Speaking of...

11:58.181 --> 12:00.559
How's yours? Work?

12:00.643 --> 12:02.394
It's good.

12:04.062 --> 12:06.106
- What's the matter?
- It's just the usual shit.

12:06.189 --> 12:08.567
My mouth among other things.

12:09.943 --> 12:12.904
Brianna, you are so good at what
you do. And you make so much money

12:12.988 --> 12:14.531
- for so many people.
- Yes.

12:14.615 --> 12:16.241
Always the smartest person in the room.

12:16.325 --> 12:18.661
- Yes, thank you.
- You're also the least liked.

12:18.743 --> 12:21.913
Yes, thank... Wait. No.

12:21.997 --> 12:25.375
I'm just hyper-competent,
intuitive, assertive.

12:25.459 --> 12:28.878
Yeah, which translates as intimidating,
argumentative, and strident.

12:30.839 --> 12:32.090
I get it.

12:32.174 --> 12:34.843
- May even share some of those qualities.
- Yeah, no shit!

12:34.926 --> 12:38.054
See! This is just the kind
of thing that gets you fired.

12:38.138 --> 12:41.099
You have got to figure out
how to play with others.

12:41.183 --> 12:44.102
Or figure out how to be the boss.

12:44.186 --> 12:45.979
[sighs]

12:46.062 --> 12:49.316
What?! What do you mean
he's going to call me back?

12:49.399 --> 12:51.067
[grunting]

12:54.904 --> 12:57.407
- [sighs]
- I know it hurts,

12:57.491 --> 13:00.076
but your womb is dancing...
in a musical number

13:00.160 --> 13:02.329
that has been going on
since the dawn of time.

13:02.412 --> 13:05.457
No, it's preparing to pass
a brisket through my vagina.

13:05.541 --> 13:06.709
Such a miracle!

13:06.791 --> 13:10.253
Hey, honey, should I get you a fresh one?

13:10.337 --> 13:12.964
Please don't. But I
would love some Ovaltine.

13:13.048 --> 13:15.008
- Got it!
- Thank you.

13:17.553 --> 13:19.513
What are you doing? Put that cigarette out!

13:19.596 --> 13:21.848
We've got a pregnant woman here!

13:21.931 --> 13:23.350
Sorry.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.143
Coyote, where's Mitch?

13:25.227 --> 13:28.397
Uh, I think he's sacked
out upstairs somewhere.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.941
I don't know why though,
because I feel fuckin' great!

13:32.025 --> 13:34.027
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:34.110 --> 13:37.364
Yeah. Hey.

13:39.324 --> 13:40.992
How much coke are you on right now?

13:42.077 --> 13:44.079
I'm naturally energetic.

13:44.162 --> 13:46.749
Sure you are. Oh, that's...

13:46.831 --> 13:50.168
- What? You okay? What's up?
- Yeah. Yes.

13:50.252 --> 13:51.253
The baby has hiccups.

13:53.672 --> 13:56.383
That's weird. Us.

13:56.466 --> 13:57.593
Talkin' about a baby.

13:59.636 --> 14:00.887
You know, considering...

14:00.970 --> 14:04.474
Considering the thing we said we'd never
talk about but now we're talking about

14:04.558 --> 14:06.393
because you're so fucking stoned?

14:06.476 --> 14:08.729
Can you imagine me
with a 9-year-old?

14:08.812 --> 14:10.855
No. God, no.

14:10.939 --> 14:13.233
That was a fun summer.

14:15.110 --> 14:17.613
- I'm worried about you.
- Why?

14:17.696 --> 14:20.407
The last few times I've seen
you, you've been really high.

14:20.490 --> 14:25.579
Relax, Mallory. It's a holiday weekend.

14:25.662 --> 14:26.913
I'm fine.

14:28.123 --> 14:29.374
I am. I'm fine.

14:32.419 --> 14:35.380
- Mallory wants her Ovaltine.
- Oh, no!

14:35.464 --> 14:37.048
I was going to make it for her.

14:37.132 --> 14:39.092
Can you get the milk out of the fridge?

14:39.175 --> 14:41.886
Yes, I am still holding.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.097
I thought you were going to make it.

14:44.180 --> 14:46.516
No, not the goat milk!

14:46.600 --> 14:47.892
[scoffs]

14:47.976 --> 14:49.812
You know what?

14:51.146 --> 14:52.689
Make it yourself.

14:52.773 --> 14:55.191
I'm going to go rub oil
on your daughter's belly.

14:55.275 --> 14:57.653
Frankie, she's perfectly happy
just floating in the pool.

14:57.736 --> 14:58.862
Just let her be.

14:58.945 --> 15:01.448
She doesn't want any poking
and prodding right now.

15:01.531 --> 15:03.908
Rubbing the belly is
an important facilitator

15:03.992 --> 15:06.286
to communication with the outer world.

15:06.369 --> 15:08.163
Oh, just let her be, Frankie.

15:08.246 --> 15:10.707
You know, when you're pregnant
you don't want to be touched.

15:10.791 --> 15:13.001
You wouldn't know, you
haven't been through it.

15:13.084 --> 15:15.587
Would you get the
carrots out of the fridge?

15:15.671 --> 15:18.006
Let's see, what was I
supposed to do? Corn...

15:18.089 --> 15:20.550
Milk! Ovaltine!

15:25.347 --> 15:26.598
[sighs]

15:28.391 --> 15:31.478
- Hey, Mack. You want to talk to Mommy?
- Yeah.

15:31.561 --> 15:33.355
OK, hold on.

15:33.438 --> 15:35.190
[laughs]

15:37.776 --> 15:38.943
Hey, buddy.

15:39.027 --> 15:42.364
I spoke to the girls and
cleared up the whole trip thing.

15:42.447 --> 15:44.533
We're not going to Alaska in January.

15:44.616 --> 15:47.202
- Thank God.
- We're going to Hawaii in March.

15:47.285 --> 15:48.787
- Sol...
- I know.

15:48.871 --> 15:51.247
I think I'm not good in these situations.

15:51.331 --> 15:53.667
Let's find another time this
week and get it over with.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.836
This week? That's too soon.

15:55.919 --> 16:00.382
We have to really rethink this
and pick the exact right time.

16:00.465 --> 16:03.009
That, um... smells nice.

16:04.636 --> 16:07.096
What's going on? You're
losing your nerve, aren't you?

16:07.180 --> 16:09.349
- No.
- Yes, you are. I can see it on your face.

16:09.432 --> 16:11.267
It's just...

16:11.351 --> 16:15.939
this morning, getting that close...

16:16.022 --> 16:19.275
I saw all the hurt I'll be
causing the people I love.

16:19.359 --> 16:20.652
So what are you telling me?

16:22.654 --> 16:24.614
I don't know.

16:43.341 --> 16:46.803
No, those are too big. I
want slices, not chunks.

16:46.887 --> 16:48.054
You know, on an angle.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.390
You do realize I have a knife in my hand.

16:52.726 --> 16:55.311
I don't like you right now.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.272
Because of carrots?

16:57.355 --> 16:59.190
Yes, and because of what you said before.

17:00.275 --> 17:01.359
What did I say?

17:01.443 --> 17:04.404
That I wouldn't know anything
because I've never been pregnant.

17:04.487 --> 17:07.741
Oh, I didn't say that, or if I
did I certainly didn't mean it.

17:07.824 --> 17:11.578
You did. You've never taken
me seriously as a mother.

17:11.661 --> 17:15.790
I don't even think about you as a
mother. You're not even on my radar!

17:15.874 --> 17:19.294
That's even worse, it's like I
don't exist enough for you to notice.

17:19.377 --> 17:21.503
Listen, Frankie. This
is not a good time, okay?

17:21.588 --> 17:24.549
I have a lot to do here, and it
seems like I'm the only one doing it.

17:24.633 --> 17:28.094
You know what, don't give me that shit.
You love being busy and overworked.

17:28.176 --> 17:31.431
You thrive on it, and it
makes you feel more important

17:31.514 --> 17:34.183
than the rest of us mortals,
but I'm pretty tired of it,

17:34.267 --> 17:37.896
and it does not give you
the right to be an asshole.

17:38.730 --> 17:40.023
Wow!

17:40.148 --> 17:43.234
Well, I'm glad you're such an
expert on what it's like to be me.

17:43.318 --> 17:45.946
But who's being judgmental now?

17:46.029 --> 17:50.325
- Ooh, dinner!
- Brianna, how are you?

17:52.869 --> 17:54.704
Mom, I got this.

17:57.290 --> 17:59.417
On an angle, right?

18:04.464 --> 18:06.633
You know, I'm not really hungry.

18:10.053 --> 18:12.263
Hey, Mal, you gonna eat?

18:12.347 --> 18:14.265
Uh, no, and neither are you.

18:14.349 --> 18:16.768
My water just broke. I think
we have to go to the hospital.

18:16.852 --> 18:18.979
- What?
- Oh, my God!

18:19.062 --> 18:23.399
Okay. Easy, love. Here, I got you.

18:23.483 --> 18:26.862
- Nice and slow.
- [panting and moaning]

18:26.945 --> 18:29.072
- [loud moan]
- Okay, okay.

18:29.155 --> 18:30.156
- Just breathe.
- Let it out.

18:30.239 --> 18:33.576
Oh, it's happening! Grace!

18:33.660 --> 18:35.537
Martin, where have you been?

18:35.620 --> 18:37.622
Grace, Grace! It's
happening, it's happening!

18:37.706 --> 18:40.416
- Baby, baby, baby.
- She's in labor?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.085
You've got to get to the hospital!

18:42.168 --> 18:44.838
- Here, you talk to him.
- What am I going to say?

18:44.921 --> 18:49.009
Get me tops that squirt or get
me my money back... And be mean!

18:49.676 --> 18:52.721
Ooh, fun! Listen up, you
little piece of shit...

18:52.804 --> 18:55.891
- We're getting her to the hospital.
- Ooh, I guess it wasn't Braxton-Hicks.

18:55.974 --> 18:57.767
Mitch, Robert and I will
follow you in our car.

18:57.851 --> 18:59.936
- But he's stoned.
- Uh, it's my bad.

19:00.020 --> 19:03.189
That was three hours ago. I'm fine now.
Call the hospital, tell them we're coming!

19:03.272 --> 19:04.900
Oh, you better have an epidural in the car!

19:04.983 --> 19:07.027
You're doing great,
honey. One step at a time.

19:07.110 --> 19:09.988
[moans] She's coming, she's coming!

19:10.072 --> 19:12.198
- Oh, God!
- What can I do?

19:12.281 --> 19:15.493
- I can feel it, she's, she's...
- No, don't push. Do not push.

19:15.577 --> 19:18.580
- Mitch, do something!
- I'm telling her not to push!

19:18.663 --> 19:21.124
[screaming]

19:21.207 --> 19:23.334
- Oh, my God, I think she's in my pants!
- What?!

19:23.418 --> 19:24.961
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

19:25.045 --> 19:27.255
- I got her, I got her.
- Oh, my God!

19:27.338 --> 19:31.342
- [giggling]
- [baby crying]

19:33.678 --> 19:36.973
- She's perfect!
- [baby crying]

19:37.057 --> 19:38.808
- Look at her!
- [crying continues]

19:38.892 --> 19:41.561
Blanket! Who has a blanket?!

19:41.644 --> 19:44.940
Here, here, here. Here, Robert.

19:50.695 --> 19:53.615
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:54.699 --> 19:56.868
[Bud] The ambulance is on its way.

19:56.952 --> 20:00.246
[soft chatter]

20:00.329 --> 20:05.127
- Hello, baby.
- [soft laughter]

20:05.209 --> 20:07.253
Hello, Madison.

20:07.336 --> 20:09.089
Really? That's the name?

20:09.172 --> 20:10.673
Probably why she didn't tell you.

20:15.303 --> 20:19.348
[Mallory] Grandma loves
you. Do you see Grandma?

20:24.980 --> 20:27.149
I'm sorry, Frankie.

20:27.190 --> 20:31.277
I guess I am a little
self-involved right now.

20:33.279 --> 20:35.657
You know...

20:35.740 --> 20:41.579
for me it was the first time I
held my baby that motherhood began.

20:42.455 --> 20:43.790
Me, too.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.752
You have a new niece.

20:47.836 --> 20:50.088
And you have your money back plus 20%.

20:50.172 --> 20:52.966
Wow! Nice job.

20:53.049 --> 20:55.051
What's her name?

20:55.135 --> 20:57.053
Madison.

20:57.137 --> 21:00.182
I know... Nothing we can do about it.

21:01.683 --> 21:02.976
[sneezes]

21:03.059 --> 21:05.603
- Bless you!
- God bless you!

21:05.687 --> 21:09.816
- [giggles]
- [Madison coos]

21:25.915 --> 21:28.251
[Sol] Mazel tov, Grandpa.

21:35.717 --> 21:39.804
- I hate these.
- I know.

21:39.888 --> 21:42.390
I mean...

21:42.473 --> 21:45.935
maybe if the Cubans were
allowed to have some say...

21:46.019 --> 21:48.521
Not in the house, Sol, please.

21:50.273 --> 21:52.525
That was...

21:54.485 --> 21:57.155
I don't even have words...

21:59.241 --> 22:01.159
from a man who usually has too many.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.749
I'm glad I was there.

22:10.752 --> 22:12.045
Me, too.

22:20.303 --> 22:24.099
I really want to be here
with you for these moments.

22:24.182 --> 22:27.143
I don't want to just share secret looks.

22:30.105 --> 22:32.607
I'm ready.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.442
Anytime.

22:52.168 --> 22:54.087
Hey.

22:55.338 --> 22:57.715
Can't sleep.

22:59.759 --> 23:03.429
- Exciting day.
- Yes, it was.

23:03.512 --> 23:06.224
And it got me thinking.

23:06.308 --> 23:09.602
In fact, I've made a decision.

23:11.813 --> 23:13.940
Oh?

23:18.527 --> 23:20.280
I'm gonna retire this year.

23:20.363 --> 23:23.241
Really? You are?

23:23.325 --> 23:24.492
I really am.

23:24.575 --> 23:27.370
What about the company?

23:27.453 --> 23:29.998
How are you going to be able
to hand it over to someone else?

23:30.081 --> 23:33.335
I think I might have
found the right person.

23:33.417 --> 23:35.086
Who?

23:35.170 --> 23:38.631
- Brianna.
- Brianna? No, seriously?

23:38.714 --> 23:41.801
I mean, she's brilliant,
of course, but you know,

23:41.884 --> 23:44.304
- her temperament has always...
- I have an instinct

23:44.387 --> 23:47.349
this is going to be just great for her.

23:47.431 --> 23:49.642
And for me.

23:51.519 --> 23:52.937
And for us.

23:53.855 --> 23:55.106
Mm-hmm.

23:55.190 --> 23:59.319
I know you get upset when I work
on holidays. I get upset, too.

23:59.402 --> 24:02.071
I miss so much.

24:02.155 --> 24:05.158
What if I'd been talking on
the phone about squirt tops

24:05.241 --> 24:08.786
when our granddaughter was being born?

24:11.373 --> 24:12.498
I miss you.

24:16.752 --> 24:18.880
Maybe we could...

24:18.963 --> 24:23.009
I don't know... reconnect.

24:28.306 --> 24:30.558
Wonderful.

24:33.061 --> 24:34.270
So I stayed.

24:35.897 --> 24:38.024
Out of what, a sense of duty?

24:38.107 --> 24:41.652
No. I just...

24:44.488 --> 24:50.036
My heart broke for you, and I
had to give you what you wanted.

24:52.538 --> 24:55.624
Of course, it was crueler not to leave.

25:00.046 --> 25:03.216
You could have saved us both five years.

25:05.301 --> 25:08.096
Actually, I could have.

25:13.476 --> 25:19.023
I really want to be here
with you for these moments.

25:19.107 --> 25:22.610
I don't want to just share secret looks.

25:24.820 --> 25:29.158
I'm ready. Anytime.

25:52.890 --> 25:55.851
Is that why you were breathing
into a paper bag at breakfast?

25:55.935 --> 25:58.646
I didn't know what I saw,

25:58.729 --> 26:02.484
and I'd had all those
beers and I was half asleep.

26:02.566 --> 26:05.987
It made no sense, so I
just put it out of my mind,

26:06.070 --> 26:09.365
and even when you told us you
were gay, I still didn't want to...

26:09.449 --> 26:10.616
I couldn't, I couldn't...

26:10.699 --> 26:14.162
You put it in that place you put
things when you don't want to know.

26:14.245 --> 26:15.913
I get it, honey, believe me.

26:15.997 --> 26:18.124
And I thought the next
morning I dreamt it...

26:18.207 --> 26:20.793
- Hmm.
- But I had just started at the job,

26:20.876 --> 26:23.546
and maybe that was just
a convenient excuse.

26:23.629 --> 26:26.424
You're not to blame for
this. This is not your fault.

26:26.508 --> 26:28.801
But if I had just said something.

26:28.884 --> 26:32.514
Bud, even if you had told us, we
probably wouldn't have believed you.

26:32.596 --> 26:38.311
Besides, you gave me five
more years with your father.

26:45.360 --> 26:46.861
[Frankie] Mmm.

26:50.198 --> 26:52.116
[Grace and Frankie giggle]

26:52.200 --> 26:55.328
[Grace] Uh, too many
people, too many people!

27:01.417 --> 27:04.086
- Yay!
- Yes!
