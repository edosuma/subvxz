00:24.375 --> 00:25.833
An Unforgettable Year
SUMMER

00:25.916 --> 00:27.958
<i>Summer is coming</i>

00:28.625 --> 00:31.333
<i>The warmth in your heart</i>

00:32.166 --> 00:35.000
<i>That colorful magic</i>

00:35.791 --> 00:38.083
<i>Is part of life</i>

00:39.541 --> 00:41.916
BASED ON THE WORK OF
THALITA REBOUÇAS

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
<i>It won't take long now</i>

00:43.083 --> 00:45.916
<i>All the girls with their butts out</i>

00:46.583 --> 00:49.833
<i>Topless on the sand</i>

00:49.916 --> 00:53.166
<i>Turning into mermaids</i>

00:53.625 --> 00:56.666
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:00.833 --> 01:04.458
<i>Burning up just for me</i>

01:07.541 --> 01:11.625
- 58, 59, 60...
- Grandma! Tavinho!

01:11.708 --> 01:15.750
Everything's ready out there.
Let's go before Dad gets here.

01:15.833 --> 01:19.291
- Hey, do I really have to go?
- Of course, Tavinho!

01:19.375 --> 01:21.000
Come on, Grandma! What's that?

01:21.083 --> 01:23.625
Queilinha's tribute to Portela.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.583
Queilinha Quero-Quero
will be a main dancer this year.

01:26.666 --> 01:29.916
On Ash Wednesday,
she's holding Rio's biggest street party.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.166
I miss Rio de Janeiro so much!

01:32.250 --> 01:36.958
I'd love to enjoy Carnaval again,
one last time.

01:37.041 --> 01:40.333
Seriously, Grandma?
I don't get that repetitive music.

01:40.416 --> 01:44.958
As well as all those sweaty people up
against you, the body odor, beer breath...

01:45.083 --> 01:46.000
I hate it!

01:46.083 --> 01:48.166
It's because you haven't lived it.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.458
I'm okay, darling.
I've got other priorities.

01:51.541 --> 01:54.916
We've got to go because my teacher
has probably arrived.

01:55.000 --> 01:58.333
Let's go, Grandma. It's for a good cause.

01:58.416 --> 02:02.416
Just think, if Inha's show is a success,
she'll be in Paris next year.

02:02.500 --> 02:05.625
Imagine! Then I'll turn
her room into a gym.

02:06.500 --> 02:07.750
- Dork.
- "Dork."

02:07.833 --> 02:09.000
And we'll go to Paris!

02:09.083 --> 02:10.250
And we'll go to Paris.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.291
- Don't forget the stool.
- Okay.

02:12.375 --> 02:15.083
Come on, Grandma.
The show's going to be great.

02:25.958 --> 02:27.750
Put Grandma's chair here.

02:27.833 --> 02:29.625
- You can sit here, Grandma.
- Thanks.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.208
Here, Grandma.

02:32.291 --> 02:34.125
You look beautiful!

02:34.208 --> 02:37.458
- Thanks dear. Love you. Good luck!
- You're welcome.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.875
Márcia, darling!

02:39.958 --> 02:42.791
- Thanks so much for coming.
- I was so curious!

02:42.875 --> 02:45.500
Now I'll show you all the clothes...

02:46.208 --> 02:50.208
- Guys, why is it taking so long?
- Tavinho, tell your sister to be patient.

02:50.291 --> 02:53.000
- For God's sake.
- Inha, this is tough!

02:53.083 --> 02:55.083
Tavinho, that's not for now, but later.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.708
- Sorry!
- I'll help you.

02:56.791 --> 03:00.041
So Márcia, do I deserve
a recommendation to study in Paris?

03:00.125 --> 03:01.958
Of course. It'll be easy to write.

03:02.041 --> 03:05.208
- Thanks!
- But Inha, I'm your teacher.

03:05.291 --> 03:07.083
A letter from me isn't worth much.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.875
I know. That's why I'm doing this show.

03:09.958 --> 03:12.916
I need something that sets me apart.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.375
And besides, my Dad thinks
studying fashion is a joke.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.500
I need this scholarship in Paris

03:18.583 --> 03:21.708
because he wants me
to work with him after graduation.

03:21.791 --> 03:24.333
- Like my brother.
- Jeez!

03:24.416 --> 03:26.750
What are all those people going to say?

03:26.833 --> 03:30.833
That you're an empowered guy,

03:30.916 --> 03:36.000
secure in your masculinity,
totally unbothered by their toxicity.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.958
Oh, but they won't say that.
They really won't!

03:41.166 --> 03:43.125
Thanks! I'm going to start, okay?

03:47.208 --> 03:50.416
Good afternoon.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.916
I'm Inha Torres, a stylist,

03:53.000 --> 03:58.208
and this is Mirantinho's
first fashion show!

04:06.375 --> 04:11.750
This first look is
a totally deconstructed suit.

04:11.833 --> 04:15.333
He shows off a denim skirt...

04:15.416 --> 04:18.333
- Jeez, I look ridiculous.
- I upcycled myself,

04:18.416 --> 04:21.583
with pockets from other trousers.

04:28.291 --> 04:32.125
Presenting the second look of the show.

04:32.208 --> 04:35.291
All hand crocheted by me.

04:35.375 --> 04:37.708
It's made up of two pieces.

04:37.791 --> 04:41.875
The wonderful long trousers and the top

04:41.958 --> 04:44.750
which together make up a jumpsuit.

04:44.833 --> 04:47.583
- Stop!
- Now...

04:47.666 --> 04:51.125
- Dad?
- This event is canceled.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.541
I'm here for your safety.

04:54.625 --> 04:59.625
We're the PFV, the Party of Family Values!

04:59.708 --> 05:02.166
And you're disturbing public order!

05:02.250 --> 05:03.750
- Dad, are you crazy?
- God!

05:04.958 --> 05:06.875
It's indecent!

05:07.416 --> 05:09.875
- Tavinho, what's that?
- I don't know.

05:10.708 --> 05:11.541
Crochet!

05:12.375 --> 05:15.125
Mom, stop recording!

05:15.750 --> 05:17.333
Both of you come with me now!

05:17.416 --> 05:18.458
Come!

05:18.541 --> 05:20.958
- You're ruining my event!
- This is a mess.

05:21.041 --> 05:25.125
There's a fashion show going on!
Dad, you can't censor my event.

05:25.208 --> 05:28.375
Event? You're wreaking havoc
in a public square.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.041
- It's just a fashion show.
- Fashion show?

05:32.125 --> 05:34.625
This looks like a samba school costume.

05:34.708 --> 05:38.875
Dad! Stop being so old-fashioned,
prejudiced and sexist!

05:38.958 --> 05:43.958
Darling, you have to understand
that Mirantinho is a traditional place.

05:44.041 --> 05:48.083
And the party is choosing
its candidate for governor!

05:48.166 --> 05:51.750
But I need this show to be accepted
into post-grad in Paris!

05:51.833 --> 05:54.083
I need my children by my side right now.

05:55.666 --> 05:56.791
In fact,

05:56.875 --> 06:00.291
I want you two to come
to the party convention,

06:00.375 --> 06:03.458
which is starting now,
two weeks before Carnaval.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.500
I'll stay and take care of Grandma.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.166
You stay. Tavinho is coming with me.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.125
What?

06:19.791 --> 06:23.500
And for God's sake,
don't start making shit up!

06:25.041 --> 06:25.958
Let's go, Tavinho!

06:26.666 --> 06:28.250
- I don't know...
- Let's go!

06:29.250 --> 06:31.333
Get those clothes off. What is that?

06:34.208 --> 06:38.291
No, it's going to work out, man!
I've got it under control.

06:38.375 --> 06:42.500
Don't worry, it will.
I know the speed isn't ideal.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.375
It's the paperwork...

06:44.458 --> 06:48.375
What? Hey, Mom! Turn that off!
Can't you see I'm working?

06:48.458 --> 06:51.041
- Grandma, don't turn it off!
- No one respects me!

06:51.125 --> 06:52.708
<i>...like Carrie Goldenblat,</i>

06:52.791 --> 06:55.416
<i>with a Brazilian father</i>
<i>and an American mother,</i>

06:55.500 --> 06:57.875
<i>- Carrie's one of the world's...</i>
- My Portela!

06:57.958 --> 06:59.541
<i>...most famous stylists.</i>

06:59.625 --> 07:03.833
<i>She hasn't worked in Brazil since</i>
<i>she opened her atelier in Los Angeles,</i>

07:03.916 --> 07:04.750
<i>until now.</i>

07:04.833 --> 07:08.125
<i>Her love affair with Portela</i>
<i>started two years ago</i>

07:08.208 --> 07:12.041
<i>when Carrie visited the samba school</i>
<i>and saw Rio's Carnaval.</i>

07:12.125 --> 07:13.583
<i>Was it too good to pass up?</i>

07:14.708 --> 07:16.750
<i>You can't say no to Portela.</i>

07:16.833 --> 07:21.083
If that woman gave me a recommendation,
they'd accept me in a flash.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.500
So go talk to her.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.916
- Go to Portela?
- Yep!

07:26.000 --> 07:27.333
Don't be silly, Grandma.

07:28.500 --> 07:29.333
Inha!

07:30.083 --> 07:31.583
Inha, I have an idea.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.291
If you want, I'll go with you. My dear...

07:35.375 --> 07:37.208
<i>Look, guys, it's so...</i>

07:37.291 --> 07:40.333
It's my chance to take you
to see Carnaval, Inha!

07:40.416 --> 07:44.041
Imagine me showing you Portela's
eagle coming down the avenue.

07:44.875 --> 07:50.375
<i>Portela, I've never seen anything prettier</i>

07:50.458 --> 07:52.625
Look! I've got goosebumps!

07:52.708 --> 07:55.333
- Shall we, Inha?
- Grandma, you're crazy!

07:55.416 --> 07:56.791
Crazy about you!

07:58.416 --> 07:59.791
Check it out.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.708
Look!

08:02.458 --> 08:03.333
Really?

08:04.166 --> 08:05.875
<i>- Go to Rio? You're crazy.</i>
<i>- Please.</i>

08:05.958 --> 08:09.041
What happened to your mom
wasn't enough for you?

08:09.125 --> 08:12.041
- We'll be careful.
- During Carnaval!

08:12.125 --> 08:16.791
- I'm thinking of your safety!
- You're not. You're being pretentious.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.750
Thanks, Mom. Thanks a lot.

08:18.833 --> 08:23.416
Darling, I left Rio for your safety.

08:23.500 --> 08:26.958
I chose a city where they
don't have that stupid party.

08:27.041 --> 08:29.708
It's not about Carnaval.
It's about my post-grad.

08:29.791 --> 08:32.791
- When you started those classes...
- College!

08:32.875 --> 08:35.041
Whatever. I didn't stand in your way.

08:35.125 --> 08:39.458
But I'm about to become
a candidate for state governor.

08:39.541 --> 08:42.666
Dad, I have to finish college.
Don't do this to me.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.208
Until the end of the year.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.000
If there's no scholarship,
you'll work on the campaign with me.

08:52.083 --> 08:53.208
I love you.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.791
Daddy's little girl!

08:56.500 --> 08:59.958
Look after Grandma, okay?
I'll be back on Ash Wednesday.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.375
Okay?

09:02.250 --> 09:05.125
Hey, what's this?
You think you're driving?

09:05.208 --> 09:07.958
- What?
- You crazy? I'd prefer not to die.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.500
Grandma!

09:16.250 --> 09:17.125
What is it?

09:17.208 --> 09:20.416
Your dad's need to control everything
makes me nervous.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.958
- It makes it worse.
- I don't know what to do.

09:23.041 --> 09:24.291
Believe in your dream!

09:24.375 --> 09:26.666
Or do you want to end up like me?

09:26.750 --> 09:28.333
Old and on the sofa all day,

09:28.416 --> 09:31.666
dreaming of a carnaval
which is never going to happen.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.500
Hang on!

09:36.083 --> 09:39.125
Dad said he'd be away
for two weeks, right?

09:39.208 --> 09:40.208
Yes.

09:40.291 --> 09:43.000
There's time to go
without him finding out.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.125
- He won't find out!
- And you'll come with me!

09:46.208 --> 09:48.958
I'd love to! But if I do,
Otavio will find out.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.833
I won't go. It's your dream too.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.875
Darling, listen.

09:53.708 --> 09:57.500
I don't have the strength
to party at Carnaval.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.250
Inha, I've done my fair share.

10:00.333 --> 10:03.208
It's your turn now, miss!

10:04.000 --> 10:05.250
Oh, Grandma!

10:07.291 --> 10:11.708
Grandma, I've organized
all your medicine for 15 days, okay?

10:11.791 --> 10:12.666
Okay.

10:13.708 --> 10:16.416
Now, please, don't mess things up.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.833
Go, Inha! Now!

10:19.375 --> 10:20.458
Oh, Grandma, really?

10:23.958 --> 10:25.458
Small, medium or large?

10:26.333 --> 10:29.083
- No, Grandma. I'll go!
- Go, go!

10:31.791 --> 10:32.750
Love you!

10:32.833 --> 10:36.333
MORE FAMILY, LESS PARTYING
OTAVIO

11:18.083 --> 11:20.458
<i>Where are you, girl?</i>
<i>Weren't you almost here?</i>

11:20.541 --> 11:24.125
Girl, I thought I was close.
But I'm still 40 minutes away.

11:24.208 --> 11:26.375
<i>Lots of street parties today.</i>

11:26.458 --> 11:28.375
Street parties? In January?

11:28.458 --> 11:32.291
<i>January, February, March, April...</i>
<i>Welcome to Rio, girl!</i>

11:32.375 --> 11:34.833
Hang on.
They're going to dent my dad's car.

11:36.958 --> 11:39.333
Come on, lady! Move!

11:42.250 --> 11:43.791
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- What was that?

11:43.875 --> 11:46.041
- What happened? Are you crazy?
<i>- Hello?</i>

11:46.125 --> 11:48.875
What happened? Are you hurt?

11:48.958 --> 11:50.875
- My nose!
- Don't move. I'll fix this.

11:51.708 --> 11:52.708
Don't move!

11:52.791 --> 11:56.583
A shower of love, darlings!

12:11.708 --> 12:14.750
- My nose!
- I'll call an ambulance. Don't move.

12:14.833 --> 12:17.791
It's fine. It was just a knock.
It's all good.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.416
You're not from Rio.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.416
You're literally a clown!

12:22.500 --> 12:23.333
My leg...

12:23.458 --> 12:26.625
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- It's a joke! It's Carnaval.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.833
Everyone's having fun.
You don't have to feel bad.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.708
- Feel bad? Me?
- Yeah.

12:32.791 --> 12:35.041
You stepped in front of my car.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.500
Okay. Happy Carnaval to you too.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.333
Do I look like I like Carnaval?

12:41.416 --> 12:44.541
I get it. You think Carnaval
is the root of all evil.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.541
I don't, no. I just think it's pointless.

12:58.791 --> 13:00.000
Clown!

13:03.458 --> 13:06.000
Jeez, Inha, your hair
is full of confetti, babe.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.791
- That won't work. You need a shower.
- Really?

13:09.625 --> 13:12.625
So tell me. Was the guy you ran over hot?

13:15.250 --> 13:17.916
I didn't notice.
Where should I put my case?

13:18.000 --> 13:22.166
You can sleep with me upstairs,
or there's a sofa down here.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.041
Here's great.

13:24.125 --> 13:26.000
Kaká, I'm here to work.

13:26.625 --> 13:28.208
That's it!

13:28.291 --> 13:32.958
Inha, I have to show you my new song.
It's beautiful, perfect, wonderful!

13:33.041 --> 13:35.250
But I need to send it to my manager.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.250
What? You have a manager now?

13:38.833 --> 13:41.500
No, that's a detail I'm still missing,

13:41.583 --> 13:44.083
but I think it's good to say it,
manifest it,

13:44.166 --> 13:45.958
put it out into the universe.

13:46.041 --> 13:47.041
Anyway...

13:57.958 --> 14:01.125
<i>I got ready for Carnaval</i>

14:01.208 --> 14:04.916
<i>Did my makeup</i>
<i>Set myself free</i>

14:05.000 --> 14:07.500
<i>The street party was amazing</i>

14:07.583 --> 14:10.833
<i>And at the end I found you</i>

14:11.666 --> 14:15.666
<i>You appeared just like that</i>
<i>Cherubim's wing</i>

14:15.750 --> 14:18.458
<i>And I suddenly fell in love</i>

14:19.333 --> 14:23.833
<i>I don't yet know what you like the most</i>

14:25.125 --> 14:28.625
<i>You appeared just like that</i>
<i>Cherubim's wing</i>

14:28.708 --> 14:32.000
<i>And I suddenly fell in love</i>

14:32.083 --> 14:36.666
<i>Do you want to be mine too?</i>

14:39.916 --> 14:42.833
RESPECT THIS PLACE

14:49.541 --> 14:51.458
What's going on? For God's sake.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.166
- What's this? Are you stalking me?
- You?

14:55.250 --> 14:57.333
- Me? What about me?
- Is this revenge?

14:57.416 --> 15:00.041
Revenge? Look at the size of that monkey!

15:01.708 --> 15:03.666
Jeez, that's horrible.

15:03.791 --> 15:06.166
I made it.

15:06.250 --> 15:07.291
Nice job.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.708
- What are you doing here?
- I've come to see Carrie Goldenblat.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.333
- She's a stylist...
- I know.

15:13.416 --> 15:16.375
I want to speak to her while she's here.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.833
That's easier in Los Angeles.
She's very busy during Carnaval.

15:19.958 --> 15:23.000
Now please move, so you don't get hurt.

15:23.083 --> 15:26.708
Wait! Couldn't you help me speak to her?

15:26.791 --> 15:28.791
You've got some nerve!

15:28.875 --> 15:32.500
You're such a snob about Carnaval.
Why would I help you?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.708
- I'm not!
- You're in my way.

15:35.791 --> 15:38.333
I just don't understand the crowds.

15:38.416 --> 15:42.125
Porta potties. Sweaty people up
against each other. I hate it.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.500
I get it.

15:43.583 --> 15:47.750
You like Carnaval in the VIP section,
free bar with AC

15:47.833 --> 15:49.208
and ideally next to Carrie.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.833
That's more me.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.041
Yeah, it is.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.875
No, it's not that. Listen.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.333
- I really need this.
- You're in my way.

15:56.416 --> 15:59.916
I need to speak to her.
I'll work for free. I just need help.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.583
I'm sorry. People from the community
get preference.

16:06.625 --> 16:07.458
He's unbearable!

16:09.041 --> 16:10.375
I'm here!

16:12.125 --> 16:13.833
Come on. Help me unload.

16:14.583 --> 16:15.458
That's it.

16:41.916 --> 16:44.791
Excuse me. Who's in charge here?

16:46.375 --> 16:48.000
Him, Joca.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.583
- Thanks.
- Guys, careful with that.

16:50.666 --> 16:52.208
We still need to cover it.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.666
Use this blue one. Thanks.

16:56.833 --> 16:58.125
- Joca?
- Yes?

16:58.208 --> 17:00.541
Nice to meet you. I'm Flávia.
Call me Inha.

17:00.625 --> 17:04.291
I study fashion and I would like
to offer to volunteer here.

17:04.375 --> 17:07.791
Girl, it's only two weeks
until the parade. There's no way.

17:07.875 --> 17:10.875
Joca, this has always been my dream.

17:10.958 --> 17:13.916
Being here in this temple
is giving me goosebumps.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.000
Girl, you from Madureira?

17:16.916 --> 17:19.416
Born, but not raised unfortunately.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.208
I don't believe this.
You must be joking, girl.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.708
That's where I know you from.

17:26.791 --> 17:28.458
You ran over Guima, didn't you?

17:29.083 --> 17:30.458
What a coincidence.

17:30.541 --> 17:32.083
Coincidence? No, no.

17:32.166 --> 17:36.166
Anyone I shower with my glitter
has a Carnaval romance.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.333
I didn't come for a Carnaval romance.
I came to work.

17:39.416 --> 17:42.666
I told her we give preference
to people from the community.

17:42.750 --> 17:46.083
- Tell her, Joca.
- Who says I'm not from the community?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.125
- You're from the community?
- Yes.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.541
My mom worked here at Portela for years.

17:50.625 --> 17:54.333
- Doing what?
- Making costumes.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.541
She was a great seamstress.

17:56.625 --> 18:00.166
That's why I studied fashion.
She's my inspiration.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.583
Her name was Yoná.

18:01.666 --> 18:03.250
- Yoná?
- Yoná?

18:03.333 --> 18:05.333
- I don't know a Yoná.
- Yoná?

18:05.416 --> 18:07.250
- I don't know a Yoná.
- Yoná...

18:07.333 --> 18:09.375
Where's Yoná now, darling?

18:09.958 --> 18:12.041
She died in a car accident.

18:13.708 --> 18:15.000
Sorry.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.416
I was very small.

18:16.500 --> 18:21.208
My dad took it badly and decided
to leave Rio, so we moved.

18:21.291 --> 18:22.250
That's sad.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.916
I came here in search of my roots.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.833
Don't pull that!
You came to speak to Carrie.

18:28.916 --> 18:31.625
- Talk to Carrie?
- Yeah, that too.

18:31.708 --> 18:34.250
- But you know what my real dream is?
- Yeah?

18:34.333 --> 18:37.916
It's to see Portela's eagle
coming down the avenue.

18:38.625 --> 18:40.750
<i>Portela</i>

18:41.375 --> 18:43.041
<i>Portela</i>

18:43.791 --> 18:45.375
<i>Go Portela!</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:50.458
When I was small, I'd line up all my dolls

18:50.541 --> 18:52.166
and have my own parade.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.833
- Cool.
- Nice.

18:54.625 --> 18:57.125
Joca, bro, send her to Arlete.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.625
- Arlete?
- Yeah.

18:58.708 --> 19:02.708
- No one lasts on Arlete's team.
- Exactly. There's always space.

19:02.791 --> 19:05.166
- She'll love you.
- She will. I'm great.

19:05.250 --> 19:06.375
She will.

19:06.458 --> 19:09.791
Okay, darling.
Take the elevator to the fourth floor.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.250
- Okay, thanks.
- Good luck.

19:12.333 --> 19:14.791
Guima, for God's sake, you're shameless.

19:15.458 --> 19:20.000
I just wanted to know
if my son was okay. He has a fever.

19:21.666 --> 19:26.208
That's what happens to people
who use their cell phones at work.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.166
They get fired!

19:28.250 --> 19:31.083
And you, Tati? Why aren't you
at the sewing machine?

19:31.166 --> 19:32.375
I just got water.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.666
Don't push me.
I'm dying to fire someone else!

19:35.750 --> 19:38.416
- Arlete, is everything okay?
- Define "okay."

19:39.583 --> 19:43.416
How can it be okay if the parade
is nearly here and nothing's ready?

19:43.500 --> 19:45.666
Joca sent me to work with you.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.125
You're kidding, right?

19:49.208 --> 19:53.541
I need an experienced seamstress
and Joca does this!

19:53.625 --> 19:55.708
I'm studying fashion at college.

19:55.791 --> 19:59.583
That's all I needed. A student!

19:59.666 --> 20:02.958
Tell Joca you can be
on the board with him.

20:03.625 --> 20:06.208
Arlete, I can help you. Really.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.708
I know! Let me talk to Carrie.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.583
- She'll like me.
- She's crazy.

20:11.666 --> 20:14.250
There's no chance of you
talking to Carrie.

20:14.333 --> 20:18.250
Why not? I bet I know much more
than a lot of people here.

20:18.333 --> 20:22.500
See these stitches?
They'll never last that way.

20:22.583 --> 20:25.958
- My mom taught me.
- She taught you wrong. Sorry.

20:26.041 --> 20:27.291
I'm her mom.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.333
- Well it won't last, but it looks good.
- Tati!

20:33.416 --> 20:37.458
Look, girl, your nerve is next level.

20:37.541 --> 20:41.041
These costumes only need
to last 70 minutes.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.625
What you learn at college is useless here!

20:43.708 --> 20:48.125
Arlete, let me show you what I can do.
Free of charge. Whatever you like.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.333
Mom, a fabric delivery just arrived.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.833
There's no one to move it.

20:53.625 --> 20:58.625
As you're so keen to work here, get ready
to work your ass off and do what I say.

20:58.708 --> 21:00.416
Got it? Or you can leave.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.125
- You and Carrie won't regret it.
- Forget Carrie.

21:03.208 --> 21:05.416
She never comes here. She just designs.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.666
Let's go.

21:10.083 --> 21:11.000
For you.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.000
Thanks.

21:16.833 --> 21:20.000
- I'll help you, Inha.
- It's fine. I can do it. Thanks.

21:25.833 --> 21:29.458
You think you're something else.
Don't you, college girl?

21:29.541 --> 21:31.541
One swallow doesn't make a summer,

21:31.625 --> 21:34.083
and definitely not a carnaval!

21:45.625 --> 21:49.375
Leave early? Why have you decided
to start playing the drums now?

21:49.458 --> 21:52.708
Mom, I always wanted to.
But a vacancy has just opened up.

21:52.791 --> 21:56.250
Don't "Mom" me, Tati.
You committed to being a seamstress.

21:56.333 --> 22:00.416
And you have to glue rhinestones
on 70 sandals for tomorrow.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.791
It's not even half done.

22:01.875 --> 22:05.916
Either you do what you agreed
or you're out of the school. Understood?

22:08.791 --> 22:10.041
Dad?

22:11.416 --> 22:13.916
- Sorry. It won't happen again.
- It better not!

22:22.291 --> 22:23.208
Tati.

22:23.291 --> 22:25.750
- What else have I done wrong?
- It's not that.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.541
I just wanted to say that
if it's your dream, go for it.

22:29.625 --> 22:32.291
I can't do that.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.875
I know what it's like.
My dad never supports me.

22:35.958 --> 22:39.291
But taking the risk is better
than being frustrated thinking,

22:39.375 --> 22:41.000
"What if I had tried?"

22:41.625 --> 22:45.791
I can't let everyone down, Inha.
I need to finish the sandals for tomorrow.

22:45.875 --> 22:50.000
I get it, so you go to the drum rehearsal,

22:50.083 --> 22:51.833
and I'll get on with the rest.

22:52.833 --> 22:54.250
- Really?
- Of course!

22:54.333 --> 22:57.083
It's a chance to show more of my work.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.125
Okay.

23:00.208 --> 23:01.041
Deal?

23:02.833 --> 23:03.666
Deal!

23:22.666 --> 23:25.666
Oh, God! Where's my cell phone?
I can never find it.

23:25.750 --> 23:27.000
Where did I put it?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.791
<i>- Hey, Grandma!</i>
- Hey!

23:35.875 --> 23:38.583
<i>Are you taking all your medicine?</i>

23:38.666 --> 23:41.833
Medicine? The connection is terrible.
I can't hear you.

23:41.916 --> 23:45.833
No! It's a surprise for you! Look!

23:51.916 --> 23:53.541
Portela!

23:53.625 --> 23:55.416
How exciting, Inha!

23:55.500 --> 23:57.666
You can't film here, okay?

23:57.750 --> 24:01.875
I'm not filming.
I'm talking to my Grandma! Look.

24:03.250 --> 24:05.750
Wow, he's handsome!

24:05.833 --> 24:08.083
<i>- How's it going?</i>
- Hi!

24:08.166 --> 24:10.125
You hooking up with him, Inha?

24:10.208 --> 24:12.083
Of course not, Grandma!

24:12.166 --> 24:13.125
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

24:13.208 --> 24:15.458
I think that's going to end in samba.

24:16.500 --> 24:20.625
Go and take your meds, okay? It's time!

24:20.708 --> 24:21.666
<i>Okay, dear.</i>

24:22.541 --> 24:24.375
Sending kisses. Love you loads!

24:24.458 --> 24:25.708
<i>I love you too.</i>

24:25.791 --> 24:27.208
<i>- Bye!</i>
- Bye!

24:29.166 --> 24:31.208
Grandmas, right?

24:32.375 --> 24:34.916
She'd love to be here
experiencing all this.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.458
I can imagine!

24:37.875 --> 24:39.541
I wanted to say sorry.

24:40.375 --> 24:42.250
For calling you a snob, remember?

24:42.333 --> 24:44.583
I didn't think you liked samba.

24:46.041 --> 24:47.500
- Me?
- Yeah!

24:47.583 --> 24:50.291
Look at this. Pay attention.

24:50.375 --> 24:52.333
- Yeah?
- Watch!

25:31.125 --> 25:32.875
Sorry!

25:33.458 --> 25:35.458
Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I'll help you.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.708
- Wow, looks like a good Carnaval!
- No, this is for work.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.291
- Okay.
- That's great, thanks.

25:43.791 --> 25:46.250
- Beautiful costume! I love it.
- You like it?

25:46.333 --> 25:47.916
- Thanks.
- Happy Carnaval.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.750
I hope work goes well! Bye!

25:50.416 --> 25:51.500
Thanks.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.250
Wow!

25:59.333 --> 26:00.625
Inha, you nailed it!

26:00.708 --> 26:02.625
You nailed it, girl. Thanks!

26:02.708 --> 26:06.791
- Now I'll help you with the rest.
- There's no need. I sorted it all.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.625
Inha, you could have asked me.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.666
Not at all, I like working alone.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.625
That way I make sure
everything's the way I like it.

26:14.666 --> 26:16.000
That explains it.

26:19.583 --> 26:21.375
Arlete, what's the problem?

26:21.458 --> 26:24.583
I took all the costumes out
and hung them up by color.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.833
Who asked you to hang them up, Inha?

26:27.916 --> 26:29.875
Are these mannequins for decoration?

26:29.958 --> 26:33.291
- Sorry, I thought...
- Now you have to redo everything.

26:33.375 --> 26:37.291
The fitting starts in 15 minutes
and if it's not ready, Miss Inha,

26:37.375 --> 26:38.875
you can leave.

26:46.750 --> 26:50.666
- Grandma, I can't speak now!
- Inha! Your dad wants to speak to you.

26:50.750 --> 26:52.833
<i>- Answer him now!</i>
- What?

26:57.916 --> 27:00.791
Dad? A video call? Really?

27:00.875 --> 27:03.125
- What?
- Tati, hold this. I'll be back.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.166
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Inha!</i>

27:28.958 --> 27:31.041
<i>You finally picked up, darling!</i>

27:31.125 --> 27:32.458
It's dark there.

27:32.541 --> 27:33.625
Why is it dark?

27:33.708 --> 27:38.125
<i>No, it's just... I have a headache.</i>
<i>I'm trying to sleep.</i>

27:38.208 --> 27:43.125
<i>- Did something happen? Is there a problem?</i>
- Yes, darling. There's a problem.

27:43.208 --> 27:44.958
Did you take my campaign car?

27:45.041 --> 27:47.500
<i>I got a speeding fine.</i>

27:48.166 --> 27:51.791
I took Grandma to the pharmacy.
Dad, that was it.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.416
The fine was on the highway.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.208
No, Dad, you don't get it.

27:55.291 --> 27:59.458
We had to go to Brejo Alegre
for the meds Grandma needed.

27:59.541 --> 28:01.750
Inha, pay attention to what I'm saying.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.916
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>how much damage you've caused</i>

28:05.000 --> 28:07.833
<i>by getting a fine in a car</i>
<i>with my photo on it, Inha!</i>

28:07.916 --> 28:10.750
<i>Can I not trust you? Is that it?</i>

28:11.625 --> 28:13.958
You can, Dad. You can trust me, okay?

28:14.041 --> 28:15.666
I love you. Kiss.

28:15.750 --> 28:16.625
<i>Inha?</i>

28:16.708 --> 28:18.541
...and this is for the generator.

28:20.958 --> 28:23.541
The generator goes here? That'll be great.

28:23.625 --> 28:26.583
You're doing a great job.

28:28.791 --> 28:30.625
What does she know about generators?

28:32.333 --> 28:35.625
Guys, stop. That's my job. I'll sort it.

28:35.708 --> 28:38.958
You were never going to do it alone.
People are arriving.

28:39.041 --> 28:41.791
- I'm going to finish up.
- Take that one.

28:41.875 --> 28:42.916
"Freedom wings."

28:46.250 --> 28:48.041
"Freedom wings." Really?

28:48.125 --> 28:51.000
- What are you laughing at?
- What about that costume

28:51.083 --> 28:52.458
says "freedom wings"?

28:52.541 --> 28:54.333
It's really generic. Look at it.

28:54.416 --> 28:56.833
Is this my costume by any chance?

28:56.916 --> 28:58.250
What?

28:58.333 --> 29:01.250
You think it's too generic? I heard you.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.833
No, it's beautiful.

29:02.916 --> 29:06.583
Guys, why is Carrie Catherine Goldenblat
never here?

29:06.666 --> 29:09.916
- She's going to the drum rehearsal.
- Really?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.333
Queilinha, I'm a fan.
Can we take a selfie?

29:12.416 --> 29:16.916
Of course. Actually, with so many
of us here, shall we do a story?

29:17.000 --> 29:19.250
- Get everyone together.
- Come on, Inha.

29:19.333 --> 29:20.916
- Tati, no!
- Come on!

29:21.000 --> 29:24.583
It is with great pride, humility,

29:24.666 --> 29:27.166
and a sense of duty,

29:28.125 --> 29:32.000
that I declare this PFV Convention open.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.333
Brilliant!

29:34.875 --> 29:36.083
He's the best!

29:36.166 --> 29:37.208
He's great.

29:38.041 --> 29:39.291
Great.

29:39.375 --> 29:42.750
- We're going to change Brazil!
<i>- Say "Carnaval"!</i>

29:42.833 --> 29:44.416
<i>Carnaval!</i>

29:44.541 --> 29:48.208
<i>On Saturday, we'll be here</i>
<i>at Portela for the drum rehearsal.</i>

29:48.291 --> 29:49.250
What?

29:51.000 --> 29:52.666
- What?
- What?

29:52.750 --> 29:53.666
What?

29:53.750 --> 29:55.125
No. Nothing. No.

29:55.208 --> 29:57.291
It's more than just a dream.

29:57.375 --> 29:59.666
We're going to change Brazil!

29:59.750 --> 30:01.250
What a speech.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.833
Dad, I was thinking of going home
to check on Grandma and Inha.

30:04.916 --> 30:06.750
I want to see how they are doing.

30:06.833 --> 30:08.500
Good! Good idea.

30:09.791 --> 30:13.500
These speeches are so powerful.

30:13.916 --> 30:14.833
<i>Let's do it!</i>

30:14.916 --> 30:16.750
#LETS GO! SATURDAY!
PORTELA, 10 P.M.

30:21.250 --> 30:25.541
The truth always comes out,
doesn't it, Inha?

30:25.625 --> 30:29.041
I checked, and no one's
ever heard of Yoná here.

30:29.125 --> 30:33.583
You're Yoná's daughter, right?
That's why you looked familiar.

30:33.666 --> 30:38.333
She wasn't a seamstress, dear.
She was a dancer, and a good one!

30:39.500 --> 30:42.125
- You knew my mom?
- Everyone did.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.875
After the fire,

30:43.958 --> 30:48.666
she got people from all the schools
together to restart Carnaval.

30:48.750 --> 30:51.708
- Did you know that?
- No, Tati. I never imagined that.

30:51.791 --> 30:55.375
Whatever. She lied.
Her mom wasn't a seamstress.

30:55.458 --> 30:57.416
I was a little girl. I got confused.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.625
My mom wasn't a seamstress, but I am.

30:59.708 --> 31:02.291
- Let's get to work.
- Let's do it.

31:02.375 --> 31:05.250
- Let's get to work.
- Come on, Maria. Try it.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.750
- Let's try it.
- Go on.

31:06.833 --> 31:10.166
<i>This Indian is Tupinambá</i>
<i>This Indian has the soul of a warrior</i>

31:10.250 --> 31:13.500
<i>Today my Guajupiá is Madureira</i>

31:16.500 --> 31:17.458
Silence!

31:18.958 --> 31:22.541
You guys are an embarrassment.
Look at this!

31:23.166 --> 31:25.250
Look at these shabby pleats, guys.

31:25.333 --> 31:30.000
Now imagine if that happened to all
the Baianas in the middle of the parade?

31:30.083 --> 31:31.916
How will that make me look?

31:32.000 --> 31:35.083
That's it.
All four of you are fired. Excuse me.

31:35.166 --> 31:38.958
Arlete, it wasn't their fault.
I said those stiches were weak.

31:39.041 --> 31:41.208
Lord, I don't have to put up with this.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.958
Get your things and leave too.

31:44.041 --> 31:44.958
You're fired!

31:45.041 --> 31:47.875
Arlete, this job
is really important to me.

31:47.958 --> 31:51.208
You haven't understood a thing.
None of this is for you.

31:51.291 --> 31:52.750
It's all for the school.

31:52.833 --> 31:54.166
- Arlete, please...
- Mom.

31:54.250 --> 31:59.250
Don't get involved, Tati.
Inha, get your things. You too! Out.

32:00.791 --> 32:04.875
Guys! Are you going to give up?
We can't just accept this.

32:04.958 --> 32:08.791
Inha, my mom never changes her mind.
Forget it!

32:08.875 --> 32:11.750
Tati, relax. I'll fix it. Come with me.

32:11.833 --> 32:14.375
Look, we get rid of this frame here.

32:14.458 --> 32:17.708
We need a different material. A hula hoop!

32:17.791 --> 32:21.416
A hula hoop will make it light
but supportive.

32:29.333 --> 32:30.666
Where's Joca?

32:30.750 --> 32:33.583
- Shall we try it?
- Tati, I'll handle it.

32:33.666 --> 32:38.083
In two minutes, my mom will walk
through that door and kick you four out.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.916
No, you five.

32:40.500 --> 32:42.000
Is that what you want?

32:42.708 --> 32:44.541
I'm running out of patience.

32:44.625 --> 32:48.125
- I know what I'm talking about, Joca.
- It's the same every day!

32:48.208 --> 32:49.083
You tired of it?

32:49.166 --> 32:51.708
- I am.
- Imagine how I feel. Let's go.

32:52.666 --> 32:56.541
So we're going to do this together.
Together, okay?

32:56.625 --> 32:59.000
We're going to put
the hula hoop in here...

32:59.750 --> 33:03.083
Explain why you want
to fire five people at once, Arlete.

33:03.166 --> 33:06.208
You have no idea! They're irresponsible.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.125
- We're gonna finish, Tati?
- We are.

33:14.125 --> 33:15.291
This over here...

33:20.208 --> 33:22.833
- I want to see this circus of yours.
- You do?

33:22.916 --> 33:24.625
- I do.
- Then I'll show you

33:24.708 --> 33:26.916
the disaster that's unfolding in there.

33:27.000 --> 33:28.250
- Come on.
- Okay.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.291
I'm out of patience.

33:32.833 --> 33:35.916
What are you still doing here?
Didn't I tell you to leave?

33:36.000 --> 33:38.541
- Maria, show them!
- Go, Maria!

33:38.625 --> 33:42.166
<i>This Indian is Tupinambá</i>
<i>This Indian has the soul of a warrior</i>

33:42.250 --> 33:45.541
<i>Today my Guajupiá is from Madureira</i>

33:45.625 --> 33:49.000
<i>This Indian is Tupinambá</i>
<i>This Indian has the soul of a warrior</i>

33:49.083 --> 33:52.541
<i>Today my Guajupiá is from Madureira</i>

33:53.250 --> 33:56.500
Nice, Maria! You nailed it!

33:56.583 --> 33:58.666
You did something to the frame, right?

33:59.708 --> 34:03.125
Well, Arlete. Looks like you don't
need to fire anyone today.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.458
- Not today.
- Okay then.

34:05.541 --> 34:06.916
And another thing...

34:07.000 --> 34:10.500
- I need a waitress for tomorrow.
- Tati's coming. Don't worry.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.916
- Perfect.
- Joca.

34:12.541 --> 34:14.416
Is Carrie going to that rehearsal?

34:14.500 --> 34:18.000
- She is.
- Do you need someone to help?

34:18.708 --> 34:22.333
Arlete, let Inha go too.
There will be a lot of people to dress up.

34:22.416 --> 34:26.208
- Joca, I can't let anyone else go.
- I don't get it, Arlete.

34:26.291 --> 34:30.875
Five minutes ago, you wanted to fire
everyone. You can do without her, right?

34:31.916 --> 34:35.541
Okay. And another thing,
don't be late tomorrow!

34:43.500 --> 34:44.625
Okay then!

34:44.708 --> 34:45.958
Let's do it!

34:49.958 --> 34:51.916
NEXT STATION MADUREIRA

35:38.875 --> 35:40.083
Thank you.

35:45.208 --> 35:48.416
Wow, girl! This VIP area is fancy!

35:48.500 --> 35:51.458
It's so fancy, Inha. I can't believe it.

35:51.541 --> 35:55.125
Kaká, chill!
It's already risky bringing you here.

35:55.208 --> 35:58.125
Now do something useful.
Help me find Carrie.

35:58.208 --> 35:59.041
Okay.

35:59.125 --> 36:00.083
Carrie, okay...

36:01.750 --> 36:04.000
- What? Is it Carrie?
- No!

36:04.083 --> 36:06.083
Inha, it's Queilinha Quero-Quero.

36:06.166 --> 36:08.333
Wow, she's here!

36:08.416 --> 36:10.083
See that guy next to her?

36:10.166 --> 36:12.708
That's her manager. He's killing it.

36:12.791 --> 36:16.958
He's organizing her street party.
It will be the biggest this year.

36:17.041 --> 36:20.958
I've sent him hundreds of emails
with my music, my material,

36:21.041 --> 36:22.375
and he never answers.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.083
You're introducing me to him.

36:25.166 --> 36:28.041
You are because I've never asked you
for anything.

36:28.125 --> 36:29.291
Kaká!

36:30.166 --> 36:32.500
- One ticket, please.
- It's 50 reais.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.625
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

36:40.208 --> 36:41.541
- Hey, girls!
- Hey!

36:41.625 --> 36:44.375
Glad you're here. I'm late.
Can you finish up here?

36:44.458 --> 36:46.041
- Sure.
- The drums are starting.

36:46.125 --> 36:47.541
- Go.
- Bye, Queilinha!

36:47.625 --> 36:48.875
- Crush it, Tati!
- Okay.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.041
Hold this, Queilinha? Thanks.

36:51.583 --> 36:53.875
- So how are you doing?
- Great, you?

36:53.958 --> 36:55.166
You look amazing.

36:55.250 --> 36:59.166
I want to introduce you
to someone really special.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.041
- Who?
- My friend Kaká.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.458
- Hi, Queilinha. I'm Kaká.
- Hi, darling.

37:03.541 --> 37:06.291
I'm a big fan. Meeting you is a dream.

37:06.375 --> 37:07.541
- Enjoying it?
- I am!

37:07.625 --> 37:08.458
I'm glad!

37:16.500 --> 37:18.916
Queilinha, Kaká is a songwriter.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.083
- Really?
- Really.

37:20.166 --> 37:22.916
You must meet my manager.
Heitor, come here please.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.125
- What is it, Queilinha?
- This is Kaká.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.416
A singer-songwriter. She's Inha's friend.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.541
- Hey, how's it going?
- It's a pleasure.

37:50.791 --> 37:54.208
Queilinha, that look is amazing!

37:54.291 --> 37:56.208
- You like it?
- It's amazing!

37:57.833 --> 37:59.541
I also love your tattoos.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.166
My job is to think
about the artist's career.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.208
Think about the potential
they could have. You know?

38:05.291 --> 38:09.000
But how can we tell
what someone's potential is?

38:09.666 --> 38:12.333
- I don't know. I just feel it.
- Okay.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.625
Goosebumps, racing heart, dry mouth.

38:14.708 --> 38:15.958
It's crazy!

38:17.583 --> 38:19.833
What I can say for certain

38:20.416 --> 38:22.875
is that when I find a rough diamond,

38:22.958 --> 38:25.375
I know precisely
where it needs to be polished.

38:27.041 --> 38:30.500
Let me introduce you to the people
from the record company.

38:30.583 --> 38:32.750
They'll love that you're a songwriter.

38:45.416 --> 38:47.083
PORTELA
DRUM

38:54.458 --> 38:56.625
Move those hips, girl!

38:56.708 --> 39:00.916
No, Inha. You look like a gazelle
with rheumatism. I'll show you.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.083
Forward, back.

39:02.166 --> 39:04.583
Forward, back. That's it. Move your hips.

39:04.666 --> 39:07.916
Little toe. Then heel.
That's it, darling. Now turn!

39:09.083 --> 39:11.458
- My shirt!
- Sorry!

39:11.541 --> 39:13.166
- Sorry!
- I can't believe it!

39:13.250 --> 39:14.750
- There are no napkins.
- No.

39:15.625 --> 39:17.041
I'll show you the bathroom.

39:17.125 --> 39:18.666
- Okay.
- Sorry.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.958
- God.
- Jeez.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.791
Seriously, Guima?

39:23.166 --> 39:25.875
- Macalé!
- Hey bud, when are we having those beans?

39:25.958 --> 39:28.291
- Delicious.
- You owe me some <i>feijoada.</i>

39:28.375 --> 39:30.041
Let's do it!

39:30.125 --> 39:31.291
Deal.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.166
- What's up?
- How's it going, man?

39:33.250 --> 39:34.333
- Hey!
- What's up?

39:35.000 --> 39:37.041
Guima, you know everyone!

39:37.125 --> 39:40.666
I do. I've been working at Portela
my whole life. Thanks, guys!

39:40.750 --> 39:45.083
I left Rio three years ago. I missed it
so much, so I had to come this year.

39:45.166 --> 39:48.708
It seems like everyone who works
on Carnaval ends up loving it.

39:48.791 --> 39:52.250
Imagine how I feel living somewhere
with no Carnaval?

39:52.333 --> 39:55.083
Your town must be as lame as mine.

39:55.166 --> 39:56.791
I live in Los Angeles.

39:56.875 --> 39:59.041
Well mine's lamer than that.

39:59.125 --> 40:00.333
What do you do there?

40:00.458 --> 40:01.625
I'm a model.

40:02.708 --> 40:06.125
But I feel like I've got
so much more purpose here.

40:06.208 --> 40:10.875
Creating an illusion that makes people
forget their problems is amazing.

40:10.958 --> 40:13.291
But it's a fleeting illusion, right?

40:14.083 --> 40:19.083
It is, but maybe just the taste of it
could show us what life could be like.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.833
Look.

40:22.125 --> 40:24.791
You can wear my shirt
while yours is wet, okay?

40:24.875 --> 40:28.541
That's from the 2017 competition,
so it's a big responsibility.

40:28.625 --> 40:30.166
It's beautiful.

40:31.750 --> 40:33.458
I'll go downstairs and get one.

40:33.541 --> 40:36.625
- You can change. I'll be right back.
- Of course, go ahead.

40:43.666 --> 40:44.625
- Hey!
- Yes?

40:44.708 --> 40:46.000
How much is it to get in?

40:46.083 --> 40:48.083
- It's just for VIPs.
- VIPs.

40:55.291 --> 40:57.125
- Inha!
- Hey, are you crazy?

40:57.208 --> 40:59.416
- Inha! Help me!
- You can't!

40:59.500 --> 41:00.416
Tavinho?

41:00.500 --> 41:02.625
Let go of him. He's my brother.

41:03.333 --> 41:05.875
Joca, come over here please!

41:05.958 --> 41:08.708
- What is it, Inha?
- This fool here is my brother.

41:08.791 --> 41:11.458
- Can you let him in?
- Emerson, let him go.

41:11.541 --> 41:12.708
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

41:12.791 --> 41:14.125
- Joca!
- What?

41:14.208 --> 41:17.583
<i>My love,</i> the choreographer
wants to talk to you. Shall we go?

41:19.291 --> 41:22.166
Relax, handsome.
I'm not hooking up with him.

41:22.250 --> 41:23.375
He's just a friend.

41:24.208 --> 41:27.083
Tavinho, what are you doing here?

41:27.166 --> 41:29.291
- I came to get you.
- What? Are you crazy?

41:29.375 --> 41:32.416
- You came here out of the blue.
- Are you going home?

41:32.500 --> 41:34.333
I'm not. No.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.541
Here's to Portela's old guard!

41:37.625 --> 41:41.750
Tavinho, listen. I can only leave
once I've spoken to Carrie. Get it?

41:41.833 --> 41:44.041
- Is she coming tonight?
- I don't know.

41:44.125 --> 41:46.833
Inha, you came to Rio chasing a celebrity?

41:46.916 --> 41:47.916
It's not like that.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.208
- That's embarrassing.
- Queilinha Quero-Quero!

41:52.041 --> 41:54.083
Is that Queilinha Quero-Quero?

41:54.875 --> 41:56.541
- Let's samba!
- Tavinho!

41:58.833 --> 42:01.458
Look, Inha! It's Queilinha!

42:03.125 --> 42:05.916
- She's my friend now!
- You wish!

42:06.000 --> 42:07.291
She is, really!

42:07.375 --> 42:08.208
Queilinha!

42:18.833 --> 42:19.916
Guima, it's Carrie!

42:21.666 --> 42:24.750
- I'm going to talk to her. Wish me luck.
- Good luck!

42:24.833 --> 42:26.458
- Thanks!
- Good luck.

42:28.291 --> 42:29.125
Queilinha!

42:32.833 --> 42:36.041
And Queilinha Quero-Quero
was as amazing as ever!

42:36.125 --> 42:40.333
Arlete, I said sky blue.
This is royal blue.

42:40.416 --> 42:45.750
- Hello, I'm Inha. It's nice to meet you.
- Inha, if I need you, I'll call you.

42:45.833 --> 42:49.083
I wanted to take the chance
to introduce myself to Carrie.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.625
Carrie, darling. Finally!

42:52.708 --> 42:55.541
It's so good to see you, Queilinha.

42:55.625 --> 42:58.708
We need to talk about the costume.

42:58.791 --> 43:02.416
- It's great, isn't it?
- We think it's kind of generic, you know?

43:02.500 --> 43:04.458
It doesn't really say "freedom wings."

43:04.541 --> 43:08.500
- Who's we?
- Me and Inha from your team.

43:09.083 --> 43:10.166
Me?

43:10.250 --> 43:12.708
No! It's not that!

43:12.791 --> 43:16.250
You know when you have a thought
you should never have had?

43:16.333 --> 43:19.875
Queilinha, a small detail to bear in mind

43:19.958 --> 43:22.166
is that Carnaval is only a week away.

43:22.250 --> 43:26.291
So there's nothing we can do
about the costume. I have to wear this?

43:26.375 --> 43:28.583
But why? Do what?

43:29.916 --> 43:31.500
To me, <i>it's perfect.</i>

43:31.583 --> 43:34.416
Well, you might think <i>it's perfect,</i>
but I don't.

43:34.500 --> 43:37.541
I'm not wearing that.
Give it to other dancers. I'm out.

43:37.625 --> 43:39.291
I'm out!

43:39.375 --> 43:41.500
- Arlete? <i>Look...</i>
- Yes?

43:41.583 --> 43:43.958
I've had it up to here with Carnaval.

43:45.916 --> 43:48.166
- Carrie, I can explain...
- Inha!

43:48.250 --> 43:51.208
- Stop! Show's over!
- Arlete, I didn't mean to...

43:51.291 --> 43:53.791
Get out of here.
I don't want to see your face.

43:53.875 --> 43:55.583
- Mom...
- Get rid of this!

43:58.875 --> 44:00.125
I mess everything up.

44:08.291 --> 44:10.291
Carrie, please, let me explain.

44:10.375 --> 44:13.208
Carrie, please, open the window.

44:13.291 --> 44:15.791
Carrie, please! Just give me one minute.

44:15.875 --> 44:17.750
- Out of the way.
- Let me explain.

44:17.833 --> 44:20.000
Out of the way, girl! I need to leave!

44:20.083 --> 44:24.041
I swear I didn't want to cause
any problems with Queilinha.

44:24.125 --> 44:26.166
Get out of the way.

44:26.250 --> 44:29.375
I'm a huge fan of your work.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.500
I was wondering why a person like you

44:32.583 --> 44:36.666
who designs the best clothes
for New York, Milan, Paris,

44:36.750 --> 44:40.416
- would want to come to Carnaval.
- You're right! I don't know either.

44:40.500 --> 44:44.041
Now get out of the way, <i>please.</i> I'm tired.

44:44.166 --> 44:47.291
I'm going to the hotel. I'm exhausted.

44:47.375 --> 44:48.458
Carrie, I'm sorry!

44:48.583 --> 44:51.208
I know I was impulsive, silly.

44:51.291 --> 44:55.458
But to be here, to come to Carnaval,
I took such a risk.

44:55.541 --> 44:58.375
- This is my moment to prove my worth.
- Oh, my God.

44:58.458 --> 45:00.416
Don't talk to me about worth.

45:00.500 --> 45:04.791
Don't talk to me about worth.
I know all about that only too well.

45:04.875 --> 45:08.833
Because I'm always working so hard,
and no one appreciates me.

45:08.916 --> 45:09.916
I appreciate you!

45:10.000 --> 45:14.208
At least give me the chance to prove
to you I'm worth it, Carrie.

45:15.291 --> 45:16.208
You're exhausted.

45:17.041 --> 45:19.166
So you need an assistant.

45:19.833 --> 45:22.166
You won't find anyone better than me.

45:22.958 --> 45:25.125
The only thing I'm asking for, Carrie,

45:25.208 --> 45:28.333
is the chance to learn
from the best stylist in the world.

45:28.416 --> 45:29.333
You!

45:29.416 --> 45:30.666
I admire you.

45:32.458 --> 45:34.291
Let me help you with Queilinha.

45:43.916 --> 45:46.291
I'll do you that favor.

45:56.958 --> 46:00.250
So you're saying you want
to study in Paris?

46:03.041 --> 46:05.500
I've given lectures there. You'll love it.

46:05.583 --> 46:06.750
I know.

46:08.458 --> 46:10.416
- That must be Tati. I'll get it.
- Okay.

46:17.458 --> 46:19.250
Hey, girl!

46:20.041 --> 46:21.583
- Thanks!
- Nice hotel, right?

46:26.208 --> 46:29.791
Wow, I can't believe you're
working with Carrie.

46:30.625 --> 46:32.708
Come on. I'll help you with that.

46:33.416 --> 46:34.291
Here you go!

46:38.041 --> 46:38.875
Inha!

46:43.875 --> 46:46.125
Do you think we should remove

46:46.708 --> 46:50.041
these embellishments here?

46:50.125 --> 46:52.166
Do we remove them or leave them on?

46:52.250 --> 46:57.250
Remove them because Queilinha
wants something simpler, you know?

46:57.333 --> 46:59.000
She's going to be on foot.

46:59.083 --> 47:00.458
She's like a root.

47:02.750 --> 47:03.916
Can I sketch it?

47:08.375 --> 47:09.375
Thanks.

47:09.458 --> 47:12.500
The theme of this costume
is freedom, right?

47:12.583 --> 47:16.791
So we need to make sure
she's free to samba.

47:16.875 --> 47:19.166
I thought about taking the sleeves off,

47:19.250 --> 47:23.250
transforming the corselet
into an amazing bustier

47:23.333 --> 47:26.166
and the skirt into a gorgeous hot pant.

47:26.958 --> 47:30.250
We can put some applique here. Look.

47:31.500 --> 47:32.750
It looks good.

47:51.625 --> 47:52.458
That's not it!

47:56.208 --> 47:59.166
What are you doing here, Inha?
Didn't I send you away?

47:59.250 --> 48:03.166
- Relax, Arlete, it's all sorted.
- It really is. Isn't it, Carrie?

48:03.250 --> 48:06.958
I love the costume. I look amazing.
I'm gonna slay at the parade!

48:07.958 --> 48:10.666
<i>Actually,</i> I can't take all the credit.

48:10.750 --> 48:14.750
This was thanks to your input, Queilinha.

48:14.833 --> 48:19.041
Everything you said, your criticism,
inspired me.

48:19.125 --> 48:21.916
It's super original now, <i>right?</i>

48:22.000 --> 48:24.291
Perfect. Thanks again!

48:24.833 --> 48:26.500
How dare she, the double-crosser.

48:29.583 --> 48:31.375
I thought you'd say I helped.

48:31.458 --> 48:35.708
<i>My goodness,</i> this is all I need.
Now I've got to give you credit?

48:35.833 --> 48:39.791
You work for me, girl.
The fact you helped is implied.

48:39.875 --> 48:44.750
Never mind, forget it. But could you write
the recommendation letter for Paris?

48:44.833 --> 48:48.916
Okay. First, do your job right.

48:49.041 --> 48:53.541
After the parade, if all goes well,
I'll write the letter in <i>français.</i>

48:53.625 --> 48:54.833
Inha!

48:54.916 --> 48:56.416
Let's put the costume away.

48:56.500 --> 48:57.458
Thanks...

48:58.333 --> 48:59.166
Now!

49:00.958 --> 49:01.875
Go.

49:12.125 --> 49:15.000
Inha, I think it's crazy for us
to stay until Sunday.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.166
Bad idea.

49:16.250 --> 49:18.125
Relax, man. Stop being so uptight.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.833
We're leaving as soon
as I have that letter.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.250
- Promise?
- Yep.

49:22.333 --> 49:23.166
- Okay.
- Okay.

49:23.250 --> 49:26.375
Another toast to Inha
who saved our main dancer.

49:26.458 --> 49:29.500
- Cheers!
- Hey, guys!

49:29.583 --> 49:31.583
- Queilinha!
- Speak of the devil.

49:31.666 --> 49:33.625
- Have a seat!
- There's no need, love.

49:33.708 --> 49:34.958
- What's up?
- You're here?

49:35.041 --> 49:36.500
What do you mean, Inha?

49:36.583 --> 49:39.750
I'm from here, grassroots samba.
It's where I like to be.

49:39.833 --> 49:41.458
Hey, I brought you

49:41.541 --> 49:45.625
wristbands to watch the parade
from my manager's private box.

49:45.708 --> 49:48.875
- You shouldn't have, Queilinha!
- Of course I should, Inha!

49:48.958 --> 49:51.583
Unlike your <i>boss,</i> I'm not ungrateful.

49:51.666 --> 49:54.166
I instantly knew
she hadn't made that costume.

49:54.250 --> 49:56.541
- Liar.
- It's fine, Queilinha.

49:56.625 --> 49:59.333
What's important is
she'll help me study in Paris.

49:59.416 --> 50:01.125
- Paris?
- Carnaval isn't my thing.

50:01.208 --> 50:03.208
What? Paris isn't your thing!

50:03.291 --> 50:05.500
"Oh, haute couture!" No.

50:05.583 --> 50:08.458
"I'm going to Paris!"
No, this is your place.

50:08.541 --> 50:10.833
You're not like Carrie. She's so stuck up.

50:10.916 --> 50:13.000
I agree, you know?

50:13.083 --> 50:14.208
I agree.

50:14.291 --> 50:16.208
You don't know what she's saying.

50:16.291 --> 50:18.208
I still agree with her.

50:18.291 --> 50:20.958
Anyway, I rented an apartment near here,

50:21.041 --> 50:22.916
so you're in my neighborhood.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.041
Yeah?

50:25.875 --> 50:27.041
Another toast!

50:27.125 --> 50:28.416
Cheers to that!

50:32.083 --> 50:33.333
Cheers!

50:33.416 --> 50:35.250
- Know what I just remembered?
- What?

50:35.333 --> 50:36.916
I forgot to return your shirt.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
I forgive you.

50:38.833 --> 50:41.250
But only if you dance this samba with me.

50:43.333 --> 50:45.458
- Cute!
- Okay!

50:45.541 --> 50:47.125
Excuse us, guys.

50:47.208 --> 50:49.458
Excuse us. We're going to dance.

50:49.541 --> 50:51.541
- Will you let him?
- I'm watching you!

50:51.625 --> 50:54.250
- That's my cue to leave.
- I'll go with you.

50:54.333 --> 50:56.458
I'm going with you.

50:56.541 --> 50:58.833
I'm coming too! Wait!

50:58.916 --> 51:00.291
You're going too?

51:00.375 --> 51:01.375
I am. Wait!

51:01.458 --> 51:03.041
Tavinho!

51:03.125 --> 51:04.416
What's up, dear?

51:04.500 --> 51:08.833
What if I said I need a boy
with a body like yours in the parade?

51:08.916 --> 51:10.041
What?

51:10.125 --> 51:12.041
Man, it's not what you're thinking.

51:12.125 --> 51:13.750
- Or is it?
- What?

51:13.833 --> 51:17.375
A dancer is sick and won't be able
to make the parade.

51:17.458 --> 51:20.083
You'd fit the costume perfectly.
Help me out.

51:20.166 --> 51:21.791
I can't dance, Joca.

51:21.875 --> 51:23.666
Really, man?

51:23.750 --> 51:27.708
You'll learn the choreography.
It'll be great, incredible.

51:27.791 --> 51:30.208
No, I don't think it's a good idea.

51:31.125 --> 51:32.583
You know you owe me, right?

51:35.041 --> 51:36.125
Guima?

51:36.208 --> 51:37.833
You want to help a friend out?

51:37.916 --> 51:40.625
Bro, I love you, you know?

51:40.708 --> 51:43.750
But not enough to let you paint me over.

51:43.833 --> 51:45.666
- Next time.
- Paint?

51:45.750 --> 51:46.666
Sorry?

51:46.750 --> 51:48.208
- He said paint.
- He didn't.

51:48.291 --> 51:49.125
I heard him!

51:49.208 --> 51:50.583
<i>My place</i>

51:50.708 --> 51:53.458
<i>Is a smile</i>
<i>Is peace and pleasure</i>

51:53.541 --> 51:56.208
<i>Its name is sweet to say</i>

51:56.291 --> 52:02.000
<i>Madureira, lá laiá</i>

52:02.083 --> 52:07.416
<i>Madureira, lá laiá</i>

52:08.625 --> 52:13.291
<i>My place is the path of Ogun and Iansã</i>

52:13.375 --> 52:16.166
<i>There's samba all night long</i>

52:16.250 --> 52:20.208
<i>A swagger in every step</i>

52:20.291 --> 52:24.708
<i>My place</i>
<i>Is surrounded by struggle and sweat</i>

52:24.791 --> 52:27.583
<i>Hope for a better world</i>

52:27.666 --> 52:31.333
<i>And beer to celebrate</i>

52:31.416 --> 52:36.208
<i>My place</i>
<i>Has myths and beings of light</i>

52:36.291 --> 52:38.875
<i>It's close to Oswaldo Cruz</i>

52:38.958 --> 52:43.291
<i>Cascadura, Vaz Lobo and Irajá</i>

52:43.375 --> 52:44.416
<i>My place</i>

52:45.041 --> 52:47.833
<i>Is a smile</i>
<i>Is peace and pleasure</i>

52:47.916 --> 52:50.625
<i>Its name is sweet to say</i>

52:50.708 --> 52:56.166
<i>Madureira, lá laiá</i>

52:56.250 --> 53:01.958
<i>Madureira, lá laiá</i>

53:02.041 --> 53:05.416
<i>Madureira</i>

53:10.791 --> 53:12.291
May I?

53:12.375 --> 53:14.666
- Of course. It's yours.
- Yeah!

53:14.750 --> 53:18.041
Inha, can you get me my notebook
on the table, please?

53:18.125 --> 53:20.291
- I'm going to sing.
- She's going to sing.

53:20.375 --> 53:21.250
- Thanks!
- Sure.

53:21.333 --> 53:22.291
She'll sing.

53:22.375 --> 53:23.541
I'm going to sing!

53:24.166 --> 53:26.875
Well, guys, this one is mine.

53:28.750 --> 53:29.583
Here goes.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.500
- Want to try it?
- Can I?

53:32.583 --> 53:34.041
- Of course!
- Let's go.

53:34.125 --> 53:35.541
See if you can.

53:45.041 --> 53:49.500
<i>Portela is feminine</i>
<i>Beautiful flower I love</i>

53:49.583 --> 53:54.250
<i>Portela is everyone</i>
<i>Could be me and you</i>

53:54.333 --> 53:59.208
<i>Doca's, Aunt Surica's,</i>
<i>Eunice's, Teresa's, Marisa's</i>

53:59.291 --> 54:01.125

<i>She's strong, empowered</i>
<i>Goddess of the dawn</i>

54:08.833 --> 54:13.625
<i>She's the biggest, she's brave</i>
<i>She's majestic, she's for real</i>

54:13.708 --> 54:18.666
<i>Mix with funk, see how it goes</i>
<i>Drums with tambourine and cuíca</i>

54:18.750 --> 54:20.125
<i>Come and see</i>

54:23.666 --> 54:28.916
<i>She opens up paths of love</i>
<i>It's more, Portela, you make me</i>

54:29.000 --> 54:32.833
<i>Feel the presence of the mantle</i>
<i>Those who try it will never forget</i>

54:32.916 --> 54:36.375
<i>Here comes Portela</i>
<i>And I'm following her</i>

54:36.458 --> 54:38.583
<i>I know I want more</i>

54:38.666 --> 54:40.166
<i>I want the freedom to dream</i>

54:40.250 --> 54:41.125
Come on, Tati!

54:41.208 --> 54:44.833
What's this headdress doing here?
I told you it shouldn't be here!

54:44.916 --> 54:49.208
<i>Portela is feminine</i>
<i>Beautiful flower I love</i>

54:49.291 --> 54:54.000

56:15.666 --> 56:16.958
Amazing, Kaká!

56:17.625 --> 56:18.541
You smashed it!

56:19.125 --> 56:20.500
Congrats, Kaká!

56:21.250 --> 56:22.916
- Thanks!
- Beautiful!

56:28.166 --> 56:30.875
What's going on? Time to get up!

56:30.958 --> 56:32.458
Morning, Tavinho!

56:33.000 --> 56:34.458
Alexa, start my day.

56:34.541 --> 56:38.916
<i>Good morning, Kaká. Here's the news.</i>

56:39.000 --> 56:42.958
<i>Let's talk about Carnaval again.</i>
<i>It's nearly time!</i>

56:43.041 --> 56:45.333
<i>Live from the Sambadrome.</i>

56:46.250 --> 56:48.666
<i>Carnaval isn't just about partying.</i>

56:48.750 --> 56:51.083
<i>There are always last minute details.</i>

56:51.166 --> 56:54.500
<i>Portela's people bending over backwards</i>
<i>to work their magic.</i>

56:54.583 --> 56:56.666
<i>Look how beautiful it is!</i>

56:57.625 --> 57:00.000
My Lord, look at the size of that float!

57:00.083 --> 57:05.125
<i>...anywhere else in the world,</i>
<i>only here at the Brazilian Carnaval.</i>

57:08.000 --> 57:09.000
My goodness!

57:09.083 --> 57:12.666
Inha, help Maria
with this bit on her back.

57:12.750 --> 57:13.875
- Okay.
- Come on!

57:13.958 --> 57:16.166
Come on! Get it on properly!

57:17.875 --> 57:19.041
Inha!

57:19.125 --> 57:22.041
- Arlete, I'm still sorting this!
- Don't answer back!

57:22.166 --> 57:25.333
- This shoulder piece is all crooked!
- Okay, coming!

57:25.416 --> 57:27.333
Come on! Fix it!

57:28.958 --> 57:30.666
- Tati!
- Yes?

57:30.750 --> 57:33.708
- This corselet is untied.
- On my way.

57:33.791 --> 57:35.666
Come on, Tati. Fix it!

57:35.750 --> 57:37.541
Come on, guys!

57:37.625 --> 57:40.416
- Tati, wait. You need to do it harder.
- Go.

57:40.958 --> 57:42.541
- Done!
- Tati!

57:43.083 --> 57:43.916
Go!

57:45.000 --> 57:46.458
You look beautiful!

57:52.416 --> 57:54.666
So? Are you tired?

57:54.750 --> 57:55.958
Really tired.

57:56.041 --> 57:57.125
Follow me.

58:00.833 --> 58:02.541
You're going to love this.

58:04.125 --> 58:05.083
Ready?

58:07.666 --> 58:10.083
Wasn't it your dream
to see Portela's eagle?

58:11.916 --> 58:13.250
Wow, Guima!

58:13.875 --> 58:14.875
Beautiful, isn't it?

58:15.875 --> 58:17.291
It's amazing!

58:17.916 --> 58:19.083
There's more. Come on.

58:23.666 --> 58:24.708
Climb up here.

58:35.625 --> 58:38.416
- Guima, this is crazy!
- Awesome, right?

58:39.708 --> 58:41.500
It's like a dream!

58:42.291 --> 58:45.208
Yeah. I said Carnaval was magic.

59:10.916 --> 59:12.916
Hey, what's up? Sorry!

59:13.000 --> 59:14.625
Tavinho, for God's sake!

59:14.708 --> 59:16.000
Tavinho, it's late!

59:16.083 --> 59:17.333
- Clothes off.
- What?

59:17.416 --> 59:18.541
Take your clothes off.

59:18.625 --> 59:21.333
Phone and things in here.
I'll keep them for you.

59:22.208 --> 59:23.500
Here's your leotard.

59:23.583 --> 59:25.750
- Leotard?
- Emanuel, paint him, please.

59:25.833 --> 59:27.625
- Great. Tavinho, right?
- Tavinho.

59:27.708 --> 59:29.125
- Clothes off.
- What?

59:29.208 --> 59:31.541
For your makeup! Clothes off.

59:33.291 --> 59:36.250
<i>- We're back to the parade ground.</i>
- Excuse me.

59:36.333 --> 59:38.958
<i>Let's find out how Portela's looking.</i>

59:39.041 --> 59:41.125
<i>President Luís Carlos Magalhães...</i>

59:42.583 --> 59:44.375
Mr. President.

59:46.750 --> 59:50.416
- Can I speak to you for a minute?
- Yes. Sit down, Otavio.

59:50.500 --> 59:53.291
Good evening. How are you?

59:57.333 --> 59:58.458
So...

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:03.541
I wanted to know
if the party has a response

01:00:03.625 --> 01:00:06.708
regarding my candidacy
for governor, Mr. President.

01:00:06.791 --> 01:00:10.208
- Not yet, Otavio.
- Sir, you know me.

01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:15.333
I have two terms as mayor of a town
with excellent numbers.

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:18.208
- I've worked on health, safety...
- Otavio, Otavio...

01:00:18.291 --> 01:00:20.291
Mirantinho is a town no one's heard of.

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:23.208
Someone from there
isn't a good candidate for governor.

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:30.541
<i>There's no turning back</i>
<i>Oh, iaia</i>

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:33.625
<i>Let the tears dry</i>
<i>Oh, iaia</i>

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:37.916
<i>Go, inspiration</i>
<i>Fly free</i>

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.041
<i>Through curves of longing</i>
<i>Let's go!</i>

01:00:42.958 --> 01:00:46.208
That's the samba song from 2017.
Samba is beautiful.

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:49.291
Guima, I need to tell you something.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:52.333
Remember when I told you I loved Portela?

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:55.250
I remember,
but it's impossible not to love it.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:01:00.041
That's why I decided
not to go back to Los Angeles.

01:01:00.750 --> 01:01:02.166
I'm staying.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.083
- Really?
- Really.

01:01:08.958 --> 01:01:09.833
Really!

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.083
What did you want to say?

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:14.625
Never mind.

01:01:16.125 --> 01:01:18.125
Guima, I think we're nearly there!

01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:23.000
Looking good.

01:01:23.083 --> 01:01:25.166
Great, Tavinho!

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.166
Great. I'm ready!

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.500
Almost ready. I need him to be bald.

01:01:30.583 --> 01:01:31.833
Bald?

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.458
There's the eagle.

01:01:54.208 --> 01:01:55.291
Inha?

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.500
Queilinha needs help getting dressed.

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:00.166
Okay. I'm on it, Carrie.

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.458
What's up, Carrie?

01:02:05.416 --> 01:02:06.625
Congratulations.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:09.166
The costumes are beautiful.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:11.750
I didn't expect anything less.

01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:14.375
Thanks. The school is strong this year.

01:02:14.458 --> 01:02:16.541
And you're part of that.

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:20.000
Your sculptures are strong.
They've got personality.

01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:24.500
I'm sure the jury will see you
the same way I do.

01:02:24.583 --> 01:02:28.208
Thanks, but I don't think my art...

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:34.125
- Please. We already talked...
- I miss you.

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.541
- Don't you miss me?
- ...in Los Angeles.

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:40.125
- It's over.
- No. Don't say that, my love.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:43.541
I get that you don't want to come home,

01:02:44.583 --> 01:02:46.250
back to me,

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:50.416
but don't give up on everything
you worked for.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.833
I've decided, Carrie.

01:02:53.916 --> 01:02:55.416
I'm staying in Brazil.

01:02:58.416 --> 01:03:01.666
I'm very grateful for everything
you did for me, really.

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:05.625
For all our experiences.
It's just... My place is here.

01:03:06.416 --> 01:03:07.500
I live for this.

01:03:09.583 --> 01:03:11.125
I need you to understand that.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.583
Carnaval will end.

01:03:20.583 --> 01:03:23.583
But everything we built together won't.

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:39.291
- Paulo, thanks for coming.
- Hey, man, how's it going?

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:42.583
Thanks for the support.
Great show! Congrats!

01:03:42.666 --> 01:03:46.833
Just a minute. I need to speak
to a friend with a bright future ahead.

01:03:46.916 --> 01:03:48.916
I love that! How's it going?

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.541
- So good to see you here.
- Yes!

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.541
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:53.458
Be my guest.

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:55.000
Are you alone?

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:58.708
I came with Inha.
She's just sorting some stuff first.

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:02.291
I'll introduce you to the marketing staff.
You'll love them.

01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:07.125
<i>The 2017 samba to round off</i>
<i>Portela's warm up.</i>

01:04:07.208 --> 01:04:09.791
<i>Get ready. It's about to start!</i>

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:12.916
- Queilinha, you look perfect!
- Thanks, guys.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.666
- You go, girl!
- Good luck!

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:15.583
Thanks!

01:04:17.291 --> 01:04:18.958
The costume is beautiful.

01:04:20.125 --> 01:04:21.750
Thanks, Maria.

01:04:23.625 --> 01:04:24.666
- Mom?
- Yes.

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:25.916
It's all ready.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.708
- Can we go?
- To do what?

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:32.625
Queilinha gave us invites
for the VIP box, remember?

01:04:32.708 --> 01:04:34.208
You think I'm an idiot?

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:38.291
You think I don't know Tatiana has been
disobeying me and practicing?

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:39.833
Mom, don't get annoyed.

01:04:39.916 --> 01:04:41.250
I am going to get annoyed

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:44.708
if you're late
and our school loses points.

01:04:44.791 --> 01:04:47.666
My love! I'm so proud. Give me a hug.

01:04:48.791 --> 01:04:52.041
Mom is so proud. Now go
and make your name as a cuíca player.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:53.625
- Go, guys!
- Thanks, Mom!

01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:54.666
Inha, wait.

01:04:57.708 --> 01:04:59.291
Is there a problem, Arlete?

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:01.250
I was just going to get ready.

01:05:01.333 --> 01:05:05.083
Inha, although you did it all
because of Carrie,

01:05:05.166 --> 01:05:09.166
I want to thank you for all the help
you've given my daughter.

01:05:09.250 --> 01:05:12.833
For everything you've done for our school.
Look, girl!

01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:15.125
From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:21.000
- I'm the one who wants to...
- You can go. You can go. Thanks.

01:05:22.166 --> 01:05:24.500
I don't see what's so funny!

01:05:24.583 --> 01:05:29.500
Portela's going in, guys!

01:05:59.416 --> 01:06:01.750
<i>Look at Portela on the avenue!</i>

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:03.000
Look.

01:06:04.916 --> 01:06:08.166
Portela coming down the avenue...

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:10.083
Oh, Portela.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:13.166
<i>- You can see the excitement...</i>
- It's beautiful.

01:06:19.666 --> 01:06:20.958
Thanks.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.166
Excuse me, can I get through?

01:06:46.625 --> 01:06:49.791
- Hey, running me over again!
- Sorry!

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.750
Can't you see?

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:55.375
I'm trying to see the costume I designed,
but it's impossible.

01:06:55.458 --> 01:06:58.291
- You made a costume?
- Yeah, with Carrie.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:01.166
She's even going to write
a recommendation for me.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.291
- Okay. With Carrie?
- Yeah.

01:07:05.083 --> 01:07:07.375
Inha, I need to tell you something.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:10.416
Guima, they're coming! Look!

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:16.833
- Wait, I'll find a way.
- Okay.

01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.500
Climb up here.

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.458
That's better!

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:27.625
- Can you see?
- Yes, everything.

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:33.416
There's Tavinho, Guima!

01:07:35.208 --> 01:07:36.958
- Look at Tavinho!
- It's him!

01:07:37.041 --> 01:07:39.541
Wow! I'm going to film it for my grandma.

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:44.416
Go, Tavinho!

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:55.208
He's really going for it!

01:08:09.208 --> 01:08:12.500
<i>The leaders are amazing.</i>

01:08:12.583 --> 01:08:14.125
Great job.

01:08:14.208 --> 01:08:17.875
<i>A real stand out performance.</i>

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:51.250
<i>Yes, Helena, and we can see the flowers</i>
<i>on the backs of the Tupinambá</i>

01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:53.041
<i>and that bald guy in the middle.</i>

01:08:53.125 --> 01:08:57.666
<i>- Grandma, look at Tavinho!</i>
- Oh, that's my grandson, how beautiful!

01:08:58.541 --> 01:09:00.541
He's dancing, my God.

01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:04.458
I'm going to show you
my favorite composition.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.125
Tell me what you think.
I think you'll like it.

01:09:07.208 --> 01:09:10.083
- I'll be honest.
- Yes, of course! I'll put it on.

01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:15.166
<i>The leaders did a beautiful job.</i>

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:17.916
<i>One of the best of the night.</i>

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.875
- What's up?
- I want some.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.583
There's Queilinha, Guima!

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.208
Queilinha!

01:09:34.791 --> 01:09:36.166
Amazing!

01:09:41.041 --> 01:09:44.541
The costume is perfect!

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:46.250
That's my post-grad in Paris.

01:09:46.333 --> 01:09:49.375
- It looks great.
- Go, Queilinha!

01:09:58.791 --> 01:10:03.208
- Look, it's my float.
- Oh, I'll film it too!

01:10:19.791 --> 01:10:22.958
- There's Tati!
- Go, Tati!

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.708
Is it over? It's over!

01:10:41.416 --> 01:10:42.250
That's a ten!

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.541
A ten, definitely!

01:11:02.166 --> 01:11:04.083
What did you think?

01:11:04.166 --> 01:11:05.291
Like it?

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:09.375
From what I heard, it's very clear

01:11:09.458 --> 01:11:11.916
it's the result of plenty of talent.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.125
But?

01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:16.625
But there's a long way to go
until you're a professional.

01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:21.250
But I'll help you.

01:11:22.833 --> 01:11:25.500
- Stop! Stop, are you serious?
- I'm serious.

01:11:25.583 --> 01:11:26.958
I don't believe it!

01:11:27.041 --> 01:11:30.000
It'll be an honor to get
any help from you.

01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:32.791
It'll be a pleasure to help you. It will!

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:35.375
So, why don't we...

01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.333
go to my apartment.

01:11:39.583 --> 01:11:41.958
We could be alone, easier to talk...

01:11:43.583 --> 01:11:44.750
You know what I mean?

01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:49.583
Yeah.

01:11:49.666 --> 01:11:51.458
Yeah, I understand.

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:54.708
In fact, I think I understood too well.

01:11:54.791 --> 01:11:57.125
Let's forget this, okay?

01:11:57.250 --> 01:11:59.416
No, Kaká! Stop! Wait!

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:00.375
Let me go!

01:12:05.791 --> 01:12:07.500
Let me go, dude! Let me go!

01:12:08.291 --> 01:12:09.166
Heitor!

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:11.166
Let her go, dude!

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:12.375
Are you crazy?

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.791
- What's your problem, man?
- Calm down.

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:18.166
- Do you know who I am?
- You wouldn't let her go. You crazy?

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.625
- Get rid of them!
- Move it!

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.333
- Don't touch me!
- Let him go!

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:23.125
Get them out of here.

01:12:24.208 --> 01:12:25.500
Did he hurt you?

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:27.750
He wouldn't let her go
and you do nothing?

01:12:27.833 --> 01:12:29.000
- Not cool.
- Get out!

01:12:29.083 --> 01:12:34.125
<i>One hour of Portela on the avenue,</i>
<i>rounding off the parade beautifully.</i>

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:37.083
<i>Standing out</i>
<i>as one of the favorites tonight.</i>

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:41.708
- I don't need a box, man.
- We're leaving.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.500
- He's crazy.
- Did he hurt you?

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:48.416
Take that wristband off.
No one needs a VIP wristband.

01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:50.333
- Hey.
- Idiot.

01:12:50.416 --> 01:12:53.000
- What's up?
- Heitor harassed Kaká, Queilinha.

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:54.708
- What?
- Hey, hey!

01:12:54.791 --> 01:12:56.291
- What?
- Queilinha!

01:12:57.083 --> 01:12:59.041
- She's lying.
- Lying?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:01.083
Heitor, you're an asshole. I saw you.

01:13:01.166 --> 01:13:02.666
Everyone saw, you jerk.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:05.500
Do you think I really need
to harass someone?

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:08.291
She's crazy. It was consensual.
She wanted it too.

01:13:08.375 --> 01:13:11.041
What? Are you mad? Are you crazy?

01:13:11.125 --> 01:13:14.791
Look here. Speak to my lawyers.
Okay, asshole?

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:16.666
Our contract is over.

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.458
What do you mean "over"?
And the video I'm producing?

01:13:19.541 --> 01:13:21.083
And the party?

01:13:21.166 --> 01:13:22.291
Quei-Quei, chill.

01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:23.583
Quei-Quei?

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.208
My name is Queilinha Quero-Quero!

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:30.333
- Go to hell, Heitor!
- I know you're worked up...

01:13:30.416 --> 01:13:33.708
How about tomorrow when you're calm,
you give me an answer.

01:13:33.791 --> 01:13:35.791
Speak to the sponsor up in the box...

01:13:35.875 --> 01:13:37.791
- Box? Sponsor?
- Yeah.

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:40.125
I really couldn't care less.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:41.916
Look.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.083
You're going to lose a lot.

01:13:47.083 --> 01:13:48.000
Get lost!

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.583
Kaká, how are you?

01:13:51.333 --> 01:13:53.625
- Did he hurt you?
- I'm fine, Queilinha.

01:13:53.708 --> 01:13:57.375
Just annoyed we're going to miss
the parade because of that asshole.

01:13:57.458 --> 01:14:01.541
Kaká, it's fine. We're still going
to enjoy Carnaval. I have an idea.

01:14:01.625 --> 01:14:03.666
- Okay? Good vibes!
- That's the way!

01:14:03.750 --> 01:14:05.791
- Let's go.
- Forget about him. Let's go.

01:14:05.875 --> 01:14:07.250
Come on, Queilinha!

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:11.541
This school is beautiful.

01:14:11.625 --> 01:14:16.666
Yeah, but not as beautiful as my Portela
which is obviously going to win, right?

01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:19.375
- Cold beer for a refill.
- Great!

01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:20.916
- Come here.
- That's the way!

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.500
It's so much better to watch it from here.
Box? What box?

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.666
Look at you, Queilinha Quero-Quero.

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:31.625
I want my beer cold, and men
to respect women without being told!

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:32.791
- Yeah!
- Amen!

01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:34.958
Well said. Cheers, Queilinha!

01:14:35.041 --> 01:14:36.500
Hey, Queilinha.

01:14:36.583 --> 01:14:40.458
What now? Can Heitor cause you damage?
What about your street party?

01:14:40.541 --> 01:14:42.708
Inha, it's over. It was his thing.

01:14:42.791 --> 01:14:45.458
The permits, the drums, the costumes.

01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:48.583
There isn't time to sort it all
before Carnaval ends.

01:14:48.666 --> 01:14:51.166
- I'm really sorry, Queilinha.
- Don't be silly.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:55.083
I lost a battle, but not the war.
Relax, I'll turn this around.

01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:58.750
Now that's enough sad stuff.
Let's enjoy Carnaval!

01:14:58.833 --> 01:15:01.833
- Look how beautiful it is!
- There's a school coming!

01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:02.750
Amazing!

01:15:02.833 --> 01:15:04.583
Kid, your things.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:05.750
Good night!

01:15:05.833 --> 01:15:08.041
Bye. You were incredible!

01:15:08.125 --> 01:15:11.041
- Hey, Tavinho!
- Joca, thank you. Really.

01:15:11.125 --> 01:15:15.416
I didn't know I needed that.
I never felt that free.

01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:18.625
Hey, Tavinho,
freedom is a real achievement.

01:15:18.708 --> 01:15:20.583
Congratulations, you were amazing.

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:23.166
- I...
- Let me help you with that.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.416
You were amazing.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.041
Let me help you, my angel.

01:15:27.625 --> 01:15:29.458
Let me unzip that for you.

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:32.458
Jeez, what was that?

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.375
I'm exhausted!

01:15:38.458 --> 01:15:41.291
Carnaval isn't even finished
and I'm exhausted!

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:44.750
Girls, I'm off, okay?
Hey, are you staying there?

01:15:44.833 --> 01:15:47.291
- No. We're going too.
- Then let's go.

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:50.500
- Darling, thanks so much. I loved it.
- Thank you.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:52.500
- Amazing.
- I loved having you.

01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:54.541
We loved it too. Thanks so much. Bye!

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.458
- Kisses!
- Bye!

01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:58.333
- Thanks, girls.
- No messing around. I'm tired.

01:15:58.416 --> 01:16:02.000
Take care. Sleep well.
Loved having you. Thanks.

01:16:04.916 --> 01:16:05.875
And you?

01:16:05.958 --> 01:16:07.750
I don't know, Guima.

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:10.250
- Let me help you.
- It's the excitement.

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:14.833
Taking part in something so special that
makes so many people happy is exciting.

01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:17.583
You know, it's like you said.

01:16:18.916 --> 01:16:23.166
Carnaval is like a glimpse
of what life could be like.

01:17:58.291 --> 01:18:01.250
I needed to see it
with my own eyes to be sure.

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:03.875
- What?
- Guima, what's happening?

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:04.791
This!

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:06.750
CARRIE SWAPPED
FOR A SEAMSTRESS

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:10.916
- Carrie, I had no idea!
- The important thing is now I know.

01:18:12.583 --> 01:18:14.416
Want a recommendation letter?

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:20.583
Don't worry. I'll recommend everyone
to stay far away from you.

01:18:21.666 --> 01:18:23.375
If I have my way,

01:18:23.458 --> 01:18:26.041
you'll never work in fashion again.

01:18:26.125 --> 01:18:27.458
Got that?

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.208
For God's sake...

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.666
- Inha, wait. Let's talk.
- "Wait," Guima?

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:38.083
Let's talk and I'll explain.

01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:40.416
I've tried to tell you this for ages.

01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.750
You were with Carrie
and didn't say anything!

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:46.000
She's my ex. She came to work
at the school to get me back,

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:48.041
but I decided I can't do it anymore.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:51.791
Seeing what you did out of love
for Carnaval resonated with me.

01:18:51.875 --> 01:18:55.250
- Love for Carnaval?
- Yes, I realized my place is here, Inha.

01:18:56.291 --> 01:18:58.166
No, you don't understand.

01:18:58.833 --> 01:19:01.291
I don't like Carnaval. I never did.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.125
All this sacrifice, Guima,

01:19:04.208 --> 01:19:06.166
was to study in Paris,

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:09.708
- and you destroyed my chance.
- Don't say that.

01:19:09.791 --> 01:19:10.750
Out of my way!

01:19:13.041 --> 01:19:13.958
Dad?

01:19:14.041 --> 01:19:15.708
Does he know?

01:19:17.166 --> 01:19:19.958
<i>Inha, darling, where are you?</i>

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:24.708
<i>Your grandma is ill and had to be taken</i>
<i>to the hospital in Rio.</i>

01:19:24.791 --> 01:19:26.791
<i>I can't believe you left her alone.</i>

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:28.875
- Please, Inha.
- I can't believe it.

01:19:35.583 --> 01:19:36.916
Tavinho, get up!

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.125
Wait.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:42.041
Why does it feel like an elephant
is sitting on me?

01:19:42.125 --> 01:19:43.166
Hangover.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:46.583
- What happened, Inha?
- Tavinho, we have to go. Get up!

01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:49.916
You go! I don't care about Dad.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.958
I'm happy in Rio.
I'm staying till the end of Carnaval.

01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:54.916
Inha, chill.

01:19:56.125 --> 01:19:57.375
Chill, really?

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.458
I've lost everything. Everything!

01:20:02.541 --> 01:20:04.416
Inha, calm down. What happened?

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.000
We'll fix it.

01:20:06.083 --> 01:20:07.541
How, Kaká?

01:20:08.625 --> 01:20:09.625
Nothing can be done.

01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:13.916
I left Grandma alone and now she's ill.

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:16.208
Grandma?

01:20:16.833 --> 01:20:18.541
Help me pack?

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:29.083
Dad!

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:30.916
Finally!

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.583
I'm so disappointed in you. It's absurd!

01:20:33.666 --> 01:20:36.041
DR. OTAVIO TORRES' DAUGHTER
AT RIO CARNAVAL

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:38.416
All this happened
because you left her alone.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.458
Dad, Inha went because of college.

01:20:40.541 --> 01:20:42.958
- That's not important anymore.
- That's right!

01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:46.458
Starting tomorrow you'll be working
at my campaign office.

01:20:47.208 --> 01:20:49.916
- This fashion class nonsense is over.
- College.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:50.875
Fashion class!

01:20:50.958 --> 01:20:54.291
- Hey, show some respect!
- Sorry, sorry!

01:20:57.250 --> 01:20:58.375
Where is she?

01:21:00.166 --> 01:21:01.208
She's in there.

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:05.916
I'm sorry.

01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:07.833
Sorry.

01:21:07.916 --> 01:21:10.458
- Everyone thinks old people are sick.
- Grandma?

01:21:10.541 --> 01:21:12.000
- I'm not sick!
- Grandma!

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:14.666
My lovely grandchildren!

01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:16.500
- Are you okay?
- How do you feel?

01:21:16.583 --> 01:21:17.625
I'm great.

01:21:17.708 --> 01:21:21.000
I'm really happy
my grandchildren experienced Carnaval.

01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.583
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I shouldn't have left you alone.

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:27.916
I loved the videos you sent me.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:28.958
You did?

01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:31.500
- Me, there?
- Brilliant! I loved seeing you!

01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:34.833
Your happiness is my happiness.

01:21:34.916 --> 01:21:37.125
It's our happiness.

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.583
I knew you'd love Carnaval.

01:21:40.666 --> 01:21:44.208
It's in your blood, dear. In your blood!

01:21:44.916 --> 01:21:48.750
Tavinho, grab my wallet, please.

01:21:50.791 --> 01:21:51.791
What's that?

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.583
- Let me take this off.
- Don't!

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:56.666
I don't need it!
I even feel like going to Carnaval!

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:06.166
What?

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:07.208
Is that Dad?

01:22:07.291 --> 01:22:09.791
Our family always loved Carnaval.

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:11.500
Until...

01:22:12.416 --> 01:22:13.583
the accident.

01:22:27.791 --> 01:22:31.041
You're always defending the kids.
I need you to be on my side.

01:22:31.125 --> 01:22:34.750
You need to be more patient with them.

01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:36.458
I've already told you that.

01:22:36.541 --> 01:22:39.791
Son, they're old enough to know
what's best for them.

01:22:39.875 --> 01:22:42.125
You can't control other people's dreams.

01:22:42.208 --> 01:22:44.166
When are you going to learn that?

01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:58.416
How's it going?

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:00.375
- Don't be long, guys.
- Okay.

01:23:01.833 --> 01:23:03.708
<i>It was a thrilling Sunday</i>

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:05.416
<i>that started with Estácio de Sá,</i>

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:09.666
<i>followed by schools like Viradouro,</i>
<i>Mangueira, Paraíso do Tuiuti,</i>

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:12.083
<i>Grande Rio and União da Ilha,</i>

01:23:12.166 --> 01:23:15.375
<i>and it ended in style</i>
<i>with the glorious sunrise...</i>

01:23:15.458 --> 01:23:17.791
- What's this, silly?
- A popsicle, obviously!

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:20.291
- Thanks.
- Cute couple, right?

01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:23.000
Really cute.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.833
Tavinho, is there anything
you'd like to tell me?

01:23:27.458 --> 01:23:28.416
I...

01:23:29.208 --> 01:23:30.041
No!

01:23:30.916 --> 01:23:31.958
Okay.

01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:34.416
I'll rephrase my question.

01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:38.250
Is there anything you want to tell me
I don't already know?

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:39.916
Oh, Inha... I don't know.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.916
We don't really know anything, do we?

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:44.958
<i>The reviews of Portela...</i>

01:23:45.041 --> 01:23:46.416
- Let's go?
- Let's.

01:23:47.916 --> 01:23:49.708
I'm still getting to know myself.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.250
<i>There's no risk,</i>
<i>even going to the capital.</i>

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.083
We've got each other.

01:23:55.166 --> 01:24:00.083
<i>I've always made a point of keeping</i>
<i>my personal life out of the spotlight,</i>

01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:03.166
<i>but with all the gossip flying around,</i>

01:24:03.875 --> 01:24:07.750
<i>we thought it was best to come</i>
<i>and clear everything up.</i>

01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:11.541
<i>Guima and I have been together</i>
<i>for three years.</i>

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:16.083
<i>We met the first time I came</i>
<i>to parade with Portela.</i>

01:24:16.166 --> 01:24:18.666
<i>But nothing's perfect.</i>

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:22.208
<i>He always really missed all this,</i>

01:24:22.291 --> 01:24:24.791
<i>so I wanted to show him</i>

01:24:24.875 --> 01:24:27.833
<i>that our worlds aren't all that different.</i>

01:24:27.916 --> 01:24:29.541
What nerve.

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:33.541
<i>When the winner's parade is over,</i>
<i>we're going back to L.A.</i>

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:37.541
<i>and starting a new chapter.</i>

01:24:38.708 --> 01:24:41.000
- Inha, are you okay?
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:42.416
<i>- Thanks.</i>
- I'm great.

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:43.958
<i>And after the break,</i>

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:46.333
<i>what's going to happen to Queilinha?</i>

01:24:46.416 --> 01:24:51.541
<i>Her producer was accused of harassment</i>
<i>and taken to the police station.</i>

01:24:51.625 --> 01:24:55.041
<i>And the singer's Carnaval street party</i>
<i>will be canceled.</i>

01:24:55.125 --> 01:24:56.250
<i>We'll be right back!</i>

01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:03.875
Sometimes it's good to take risks.

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:08.625
- Even if we fall flat on our faces.
- Lord, I know that face.

01:25:19.666 --> 01:25:21.833
Aren't you going with your sister?

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:30.791
What's she doing, Tavinho?

01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:33.041
Well...

01:25:58.666 --> 01:26:00.708
I'm sorry I left like that, girl.

01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:01.625
Inha...

01:26:01.708 --> 01:26:04.708
Everything with my grandma,
Carrie, Paris...

01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:08.708
- I didn't know what to do.
- Relax, I know all about it.

01:26:08.791 --> 01:26:10.125
In fact...

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:15.875
I never want to see that clown again.

01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:20.875
Listen, I was thinking of a way
to fix things, at least a bit.

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:23.500
But I can't do it alone.

01:26:24.458 --> 01:26:28.500
But if my friends are willing to help,

01:26:28.625 --> 01:26:29.875
I might be able to!

01:26:30.791 --> 01:26:32.500
I don't know, Inha.

01:26:34.125 --> 01:26:36.041
Of course I'll help!

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.125
Time for some coffee and cake, right?

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:47.375
This cake is amazing.

01:26:49.333 --> 01:26:50.916
- It's great.
- Thanks.

01:26:55.208 --> 01:26:56.291
What's that?

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:59.208
What's that?

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:05.875
<i>Portela is feminine</i>
<i>Beautiful flower I love</i>

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:10.166
<i>Portela is everyone</i>
<i>Could be you and me</i>

01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:12.375
What madness is this?

01:27:12.458 --> 01:27:14.791
What nonsense is this?

01:27:19.208 --> 01:27:23.375
<i>She's strong, empowered</i>
<i>Goddess of the dawn</i>

01:27:23.458 --> 01:27:27.958
<i>She's the biggest, she's brave</i>
<i>She's majestic, she's for real</i>

01:27:28.041 --> 01:27:32.541
<i>Mix with funk, see how it goes</i>
<i>Drums with tambourine and cuíca</i>

01:27:32.625 --> 01:27:33.875
<i>Come and see</i>

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:42.083
<i>She opens up paths of love</i>
<i>It's more, Portela, you make me</i>

01:27:42.166 --> 01:27:45.791
<i>Feel the presence of the mantle</i>
<i>Those who try it will never forget</i>

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:48.666
<i>Here comes Portela</i>
<i>And I'm following her</i>

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.916
Come on up, girl! This is your moment!

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.208
Go, go!

01:27:53.291 --> 01:27:54.125
Grandma!

01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:57.916
I brought Carnaval to you!

01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:01.666
To Mirantinho!

01:28:09.041 --> 01:28:13.041
<i>I want the freedom to dream</i>

01:28:13.666 --> 01:28:18.000
<i>I want the freedom to love</i>

01:28:18.083 --> 01:28:23.125
<i>I want the freedom to dream</i>

01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:28.541
- Want to go down, Grandma?
- I do!

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:31.916
Guys, my friend Inha

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.375
told me this town has never had Carnaval!

01:28:36.458 --> 01:28:38.708
So, Inha, please do the honors.

01:28:38.791 --> 01:28:41.666
Carnaval, Mirantinho.

01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:45.208
Mirantinho, Carnaval!

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:50.416
Drums!

01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500
Look at Inha!

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:06.625
- Look at Inha!
- Inha!

01:29:07.125 --> 01:29:08.000
Inha!

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:16.875
Give me the megaphone.

01:29:20.958 --> 01:29:23.333
The party's over.

01:29:23.416 --> 01:29:26.041
This chaos is over, Inha!

01:29:26.125 --> 01:29:28.458
Turn that music off!

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:32.250
- Keep going, keep going!
- Now! The party's over!

01:29:32.333 --> 01:29:36.250
More family, less partying!

01:29:36.333 --> 01:29:39.000
This party's over, guys!
This chaos is over.

01:29:39.083 --> 01:29:43.625
- This is the Party of Family Values!
- Dad, stop!

01:29:43.708 --> 01:29:44.958
What are you doing?

01:29:45.083 --> 01:29:48.125
Have you gone mad? This square is a mess!

01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:51.833
Dad, stop! Stop thinking
you have to control everything!

01:29:52.875 --> 01:29:56.083
It's bad for everyone, especially you.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.875
Look at the example Mom set.

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:06.375
She knew life was better
when we all got together.

01:30:09.083 --> 01:30:12.166
If I've learned that, you can too.

01:30:19.916 --> 01:30:21.291
- Like this.
- Hang on.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:25.625
Like this. This was how I danced!
Like this, look!

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:28.208
Look at Grandma, Dad.

01:30:28.291 --> 01:30:31.208
You're so alike.

01:30:31.833 --> 01:30:33.458
Should I let it happen, then?

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:34.958
- Yes.
- Should I?

01:30:35.083 --> 01:30:37.666
The party's on, guys!

01:30:38.250 --> 01:30:40.333
It's on!

01:30:41.416 --> 01:30:45.583
That's the spirit. The party must go on!

01:30:45.666 --> 01:30:48.875
Now we're going to continue
with a new song

01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:53.875
from an up and coming songwriter
that I'm managing.

01:30:53.958 --> 01:30:57.708
Kaká! Come up here!

01:30:57.791 --> 01:31:00.041
Inha, Tavinho, you too!

01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:01.916
Dad, take care of Grandma?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.375
- Of course I will. Mommy!
- I'll take care of your dad.

01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:19.041
Go ahead. I'll catch up.

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:24.416
Joca!

01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:25.833
Hey!

01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:28.500
I... I wanted to say thanks.

01:31:29.333 --> 01:31:31.000
You don't need to thank me.

01:31:31.083 --> 01:31:35.166
I loved seeing you come out of your shell.

01:31:35.708 --> 01:31:39.958
There's just one more thing that would
make this the best Carnaval of my life.

01:31:40.041 --> 01:31:42.458
Yeah? What's that?

01:31:44.625 --> 01:31:47.666
<i>If you want, I do too</i>
<i>If you'll let me, I'll let you</i>

01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:49.291
<i>No means no, okay?</i>

01:31:49.375 --> 01:31:50.791
<i>That makes things easy</i>

01:31:50.875 --> 01:31:53.041
<i>If you want, I do too</i>
<i>If you'll let me...</i>

01:31:53.125 --> 01:31:55.291
Didn't you say you didn't like Carnaval?

01:32:00.125 --> 01:32:02.500
I can't believe you've come
to ruin my party.

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.958
I needed to give you this letter.

01:32:17.916 --> 01:32:23.041
"I ask you to consider accepting her
as a student in the fashion program."

01:32:23.125 --> 01:32:24.833
"Carrie Catherine Goldenblat."

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:29.291
How did you convince her to write that?

01:32:29.375 --> 01:32:30.416
Doesn't matter.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.166
You deserve that letter.

01:32:39.833 --> 01:32:41.500
Good luck in Paris.

01:32:42.333 --> 01:32:43.958
Thanks.

01:32:44.041 --> 01:32:46.125
Good luck in Los Angeles.

01:33:02.666 --> 01:33:03.833
Hey, come on.

01:33:09.208 --> 01:33:12.083
- Inha, what happened?
- What happened?

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.208
What happened?

01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:22.083
- You brought that jerk, right, Joca?
- Oh, girl.

01:33:22.166 --> 01:33:25.250
Inha, I've known Guima all my life

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:27.166
and I've never seen him so in love.

01:33:27.250 --> 01:33:29.458
He's going to Los Angeles with Carrie.

01:33:29.541 --> 01:33:30.833
What more do you want?

01:33:30.916 --> 01:33:33.375
- Are you crazy, Joca?
- What do you mean?

01:33:34.833 --> 01:33:36.250
I shouldn't be saying this,

01:33:37.041 --> 01:33:40.041
but Guima made a deal with Carrie.

01:33:42.958 --> 01:33:45.166
- Inha!
- Inha, wait!

01:33:45.250 --> 01:33:48.416
<i>Is it him, is it her</i>
<i>Is it an apple?</i>

01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:51.250
<i>Is it me, is it today</i>
<i>Will it be tomorrow?</i>

01:33:56.833 --> 01:33:58.583
You've got some nerve!

01:34:01.583 --> 01:34:04.333
If you hadn't lied to me,

01:34:04.416 --> 01:34:06.125
or hidden it, which is the same...

01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:08.083
It's the same!

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:12.083
If you hadn't got in my way,
I would've got this letter.

01:34:13.041 --> 01:34:15.375
The letter I needed so much.

01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:19.083
Because I deserved it! Okay?

01:34:20.666 --> 01:34:24.333
Now you want to sacrifice yourself
to be the good guy

01:34:24.416 --> 01:34:28.833
while I'm feeling guilty studying
in France at the expense of your freedom?

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:31.708
Not happening.

01:34:32.791 --> 01:34:36.541
I don't want to forgive you.
I want to be mad at you!

01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:45.708
But I can't, Guima.

01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:53.916
I can't
thanks to that stupid glitter rain.

01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:58.750
I know this is crazy,

01:35:00.375 --> 01:35:02.250
that Carnaval ends,

01:35:03.208 --> 01:35:05.416
and Carnaval romances end,

01:35:07.708 --> 01:35:10.708
but I really wish that wasn't true.

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:29.291
Guima, wait!

01:35:33.208 --> 01:35:35.416
Everything I felt was real.

01:35:36.875 --> 01:35:39.333
All our experiences were real.

01:35:40.916 --> 01:35:42.541
I didn't want it to end.

01:35:44.958 --> 01:35:47.416
I can't believe you tore up the letter.

01:35:48.958 --> 01:35:50.958
I don't need the letter.

01:35:51.583 --> 01:35:52.458
That's right.

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.666
You really don't.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:59.166
Look at what you've done.

01:36:00.083 --> 01:36:02.708
Not me. Us.

01:36:08.458 --> 01:36:09.708
See you in Paris?

01:36:12.375 --> 01:36:14.708
- You, in Paris?
- Us, right?

01:36:16.458 --> 01:36:17.666
I was thinking...

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.541
Do they have Carnaval there?

01:36:22.625 --> 01:36:24.000
If they don't,

01:36:24.750 --> 01:36:26.458
we'll make our own.

01:36:30.208 --> 01:36:33.291
<i>Summer is coming</i>

01:36:33.375 --> 01:36:36.958
<i>The warmth in your heart</i>

01:36:37.041 --> 01:36:40.708
<i>That colorful magic</i>

01:36:40.791 --> 01:36:43.708
<i>Is part of life</i>

01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:47.458
<i>It won't take long now</i>

01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:51.083
<i>All the girls with their butts out</i>

01:36:51.166 --> 01:36:54.833
<i>Topless on the sand</i>

01:36:54.916 --> 01:36:58.333
<i>Turning into mermaids</i>

01:36:58.416 --> 01:37:02.416
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:37:05.583 --> 01:37:08.916
<i>Burning up just for me</i>

01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.125
An Unforgettable Year
SUMMER

01:37:13.041 --> 01:37:17.083
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:37:19.958 --> 01:37:24.125
<i>To embrace you, seduce you</i>

01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:29.250
<i>A whole day of pleasure</i>

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.416
Dad!

01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:34.583
Tavinho, son.
Are you dating that boy by any chance?

01:37:34.666 --> 01:37:36.458
No, just hooking up.

01:37:38.666 --> 01:37:39.500
What?

01:37:40.416 --> 01:37:41.500
Just hooking up!

01:37:42.166 --> 01:37:43.000
What?

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.375
<i>In a night and a half of this flavor</i>

01:37:48.458 --> 01:37:51.458
<i>I grab the moon</i>
<i>I bet on the sea</i>

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.208
<i>How am I going to win you over</i>

01:37:55.291 --> 01:37:59.083
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:38:02.541 --> 01:38:06.458
<i>Burning up just for me</i>

01:38:09.916 --> 01:38:14.166
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:38:17.083 --> 01:38:21.750
<i>To embrace you, seduce you</i>

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:27.083
<i>Summer is coming</i>

01:38:27.208 --> 01:38:30.625
<i>The warmth in your heart</i>

01:38:30.708 --> 01:38:34.208
<i>That colorful magic</i>

01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:37.250
<i>Is part of life</i>

01:38:38.250 --> 01:38:41.333
<i>It won't take long now</i>

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:44.875
<i>All the girls with their butts out</i>

01:38:44.958 --> 01:38:48.458
<i>Topless on the sand</i>

01:38:48.541 --> 01:38:52.083
<i>Turning into mermaids</i>

01:38:52.166 --> 01:38:55.833
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:03.291
<i>Burning up just for me</i>

01:39:06.708 --> 01:39:10.958
<i>Tonight I want you</i>

01:39:13.833 --> 01:39:18.708
<i>To embrace you</i>
<i>Seduce you</i>

01:39:31.541 --> 01:39:36.000
<i>Portela is feminine</i>
<i>Beautiful flower I love</i>

01:39:36.083 --> 01:39:41.000
<i>Portela is everyone</i>
<i>Could be you and me</i>

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:45.916
<i>Doca's, Aunt Surica's,</i>
<i>Eunice's, Teresa's, Marisa's</i>

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.541
<i>Come and see</i>

01:39:50.541 --> 01:39:55.166
<i>She's strong, empowered</i>
<i>Goddess of the dawn</i>

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:59.916
<i>She's the biggest, she's brave</i>
<i>She's majestic, she's for real</i>

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:04.958
<i>Mix with funk, see how it goes</i>
<i>Drums with tambourine and cuíca</i>

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:06.708
<i>Come and see</i>

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:15.333
<i>She opens up paths of love</i>
<i>It's more, Portela, you make me</i>

01:40:15.416 --> 01:40:19.208
<i>Feel the presence of the mantle</i>
<i>Those who try it will never forget</i>

01:40:19.291 --> 01:40:22.666
<i>Here comes Portela, and I'm following her</i>

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:25.083
<i>I know I want more</i>

01:40:25.166 --> 01:40:28.750
<i>I want the freedom to dream</i>

01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:36.083
<i>Portela is feminine</i>
<i>Beautiful flower I love</i>

01:40:36.166 --> 01:40:40.833
<i>Portela is everyone</i>
<i>Could be me and you</i>

01:40:40.916 --> 01:40:45.875
<i>Doca's, Aunt Surica's,</i>
<i>Eunice's, Teresa's, Marisa's</i>

01:40:45.958 --> 01:40:47.916
<i>Come and see</i>
