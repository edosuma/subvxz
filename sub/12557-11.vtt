WEBVTT

00:09.759 --> 00:12.262
You're traveling
through another dimension-

00:12.297 --> 00:16.015
a dimension not only of sight
and sound, but of mind,

00:16.050 --> 00:17.884
a journey into a wondrous land

00:17.919 --> 00:20.387
whose boundaries
are that of imagination.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.272
Your next stop,
the twilight zone.

00:26.643 --> 00:30.397
The time is 1863,
the place the state of virginia.

00:30.432 --> 00:33.533
The event is a bloodletting
known as the civil war

00:33.900 --> 00:35.151
a tragic moment in time

00:35.785 --> 00:38.905
when a nation was split
into two fragments,

00:38.940 --> 00:42.042
each fragment
deeming itself a nation.

00:42.077 --> 00:43.910
What is it?

00:43.945 --> 00:45.662
I thought
i heard something.

00:45.697 --> 00:46.913
Yanks?

00:46.948 --> 00:50.050
I don't hear 'em no more.

00:58.558 --> 01:02.312
Dauger, you figure
this would fire

01:02.347 --> 01:04.813
if you was to press
the trigger?

01:04.849 --> 01:06.066
I reckon.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.819
What's the idea,
paradine?

01:09.854 --> 01:11.071
The idea is, dauger,

01:11.106 --> 01:13.573
you ain't a right arm to me
or a left arm.

01:13.608 --> 01:15.442
You're just
some extra baggage

01:15.477 --> 01:18.578
that breathes hard
and splits my rations.

01:18.613 --> 01:21.698
You figure you'll shape up
by the end of the war?

01:21.733 --> 01:24.834
I can't help it!

01:24.869 --> 01:26.703
It used to...

01:26.738 --> 01:30.457
it used to be i never
give it any thought.

01:30.492 --> 01:31.708
It used to be like

01:31.743 --> 01:35.462
it was some kind of game
we was playing like kids.

01:35.497 --> 01:37.347
King of
the mountain.

01:37.382 --> 01:39.215
Hide and go seek.

01:39.250 --> 01:43.219
Blind man's bluff.

01:43.254 --> 01:45.722
But it ain't that way
anymore, paradine.

01:45.757 --> 01:48.224
I seen too much
of this business.

01:48.259 --> 01:50.110
I was at the second manassas.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.120
You haven't got

02:00.155 --> 02:02.622
a nerve in your body,
have you?

02:02.657 --> 02:05.125
Just as many as you, son.

02:05.160 --> 02:06.376
From head to boot.

02:06.411 --> 02:10.130
Only i don't concern myself
as much as you.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.998
You're worrying about dead men

02:12.033 --> 02:13.883
and lost battles.

02:13.918 --> 02:17.003
That's just too much area
to fret in.

02:17.038 --> 02:20.140
I'm worrying about two scouts
on a mission,

02:20.175 --> 02:23.259
and a dirty piece
of brown paper.

02:23.294 --> 02:25.762
It says the yanks are going
to take up a position

02:25.797 --> 02:27.013
in the chano valley.

02:27.048 --> 02:29.516
We got to scout them
and report back

02:29.551 --> 02:31.401
as soon as they get
into that town

02:31.436 --> 02:33.269
down there below.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.034 --> 02:49.285
Yanks?

02:49.320 --> 02:51.171
Yanks, probably.

02:51.206 --> 02:53.673
Horses, positive.

02:53.708 --> 02:55.425
How many?

02:56.711 --> 02:58.545
It's a patrol,
i figure.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.796
20, 30 men.

03:02.967 --> 03:04.801
That's funny.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.052
What is?

03:06.087 --> 03:07.303
Well, i know
i heard horses,

03:07.338 --> 03:09.189
and it's coming
from down there.

03:09.806 --> 03:10.440
They're yanks.

03:10.475 --> 03:12.308
Ain't no question
about that.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.947
Listen, joe,
we're exposing ourselves here.

03:17.982 --> 03:20.450
This is no place
to stand out in the open.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.204
If they are yanks,

03:24.239 --> 03:27.323
they'd be in that town
down there by now.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.711
Be as noisy as
a county fair.

03:31.746 --> 03:35.465
There ain't a
sound anymore.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.333
Reckon i better
get down there

03:37.368 --> 03:39.219
and take a close look.

03:39.254 --> 03:41.721
Listen, joe...
let's pull out.

03:41.756 --> 03:43.590
I don't like it.

03:43.625 --> 03:44.591
You heard 'em.

03:44.626 --> 03:47.093
We found out
what we had to find out-

03:47.128 --> 03:48.978
the yankees are
in the valley.

03:49.013 --> 03:50.230
So we go back
and report.

03:50.847 --> 03:52.732
What's the point
in going down there?

03:52.767 --> 03:54.601
The point is we got
to count their heads,

03:54.636 --> 03:55.852
their horses
and their guns.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.737
We got to get a look at
their regimental number.

03:58.354 --> 03:59.606
That enough point
for you, mr. Dauger?

03:59.641 --> 04:00.857
I don't care.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.742
I just don't care
anymore.

04:02.777 --> 04:04.611
I only got
one big mission left

04:04.646 --> 04:05.862
and that's to stay alive.

04:05.897 --> 04:08.364
All right, i say
we go down in that valley.

04:08.399 --> 04:11.501
And we wave a shirt
and throw down our carbines.

04:13.369 --> 04:15.371
Mr. Dauger, i
extend my sympathy

04:15.406 --> 04:19.125
so long as your yellow
eats at your insides.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.127
But when it crawls
into my bivouac

04:21.161 --> 04:23.012
and tries to climb
up on my horse,

04:23.047 --> 04:24.264
i withdraw my sympathy

04:24.299 --> 04:26.132
and give you the
back of my hand.

04:31.137 --> 04:34.274
So far, you and me pledge
nothing to the confederacy

04:34.309 --> 04:36.776
except a lack of sleep
and empty bellies.

04:36.811 --> 04:39.896
But there's a couple
of hundred thousand others

04:39.931 --> 04:40.780
pledged
a lot more.

04:40.815 --> 04:42.031
You're making
it appear

04:42.649 --> 04:43.900
like they did it
for nothing.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.402
Now you stay here.

04:46.437 --> 04:47.654
If you hear a shot,

04:47.689 --> 04:51.407
you get back to the lieutenant
at a fast gallop

04:51.442 --> 04:54.544
'cause that will mean
they're down there in force.

04:54.579 --> 04:56.412
And you tell him what happened.

04:56.447 --> 04:58.915
If you haven't heard from me
in 15 minutes,

04:58.950 --> 05:00.416
you get back
there anyway.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.919
Listen, you going
down there alone?

05:03.419 --> 05:05.305
Just me and this brave horse.

05:05.340 --> 05:06.556
For want of anything else.

05:08.424 --> 05:11.427
This is joseph paradine,

05:11.462 --> 05:12.679
confederate cavalry,

05:12.714 --> 05:14.564
as he heads down
toward a small town

05:14.599 --> 05:15.815
in the middle of a valley.

05:15.850 --> 05:17.066
But very shortly,

05:17.101 --> 05:20.186
joseph paradine will
make contact with the enemy.

05:20.221 --> 05:22.689
He will also make contact
with an outpost

05:22.724 --> 05:25.191
not found on a military map-

05:25.226 --> 05:28.328
an outpost called
the twilight zone.

07:40.660 --> 07:41.911
Hey!

07:41.946 --> 07:43.796
Hey, yank!

07:43.831 --> 07:45.047
Sleeping.

07:45.082 --> 07:50.052
Must be sleeping
or are you dead?

07:50.087 --> 07:53.172
Are you dead?!

07:56.058 --> 07:57.310
Plague maybe.

07:57.345 --> 07:59.178
Some kind of sickness.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.063
But that would take hours.

08:01.098 --> 08:03.566
You wouldn't all be like this.

08:03.601 --> 08:05.434
Not all at the same time.

08:05.469 --> 08:07.937
Must be asleep.

08:07.972 --> 08:10.439
No wounds.

08:10.474 --> 08:12.325
Not a sign of blood.

08:13.576 --> 08:14.827
Wake up.

08:16.696 --> 08:17.947
Wake up.

08:17.982 --> 08:19.832
Go on.

08:19.867 --> 08:22.335
Wake up, go ahead.

08:22.370 --> 08:23.586
You aren't dead.

08:23.621 --> 08:26.088
None of you are dead.

08:26.123 --> 08:27.957
Wake up, yanks!

08:27.992 --> 08:31.093
None of you are dead!

08:31.128 --> 08:34.096
All right, yanks,
you're all my prisoners!

08:34.714 --> 08:35.965
Come on, yanks!

08:36.000 --> 08:39.101
You're all my prisoners!

08:45.107 --> 08:48.361
Well, you come
to the right place.

08:48.396 --> 08:51.480
You sure come
to the right place, boys.

08:51.515 --> 08:57.119
Food, clothing.

08:57.154 --> 08:58.371
Ammunition.

08:58.406 --> 09:00.873
What you got
is what we need.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.242
You hear me, yank?

09:03.277 --> 09:04.377
You come
to the right valley.

09:04.412 --> 09:06.879
Nothing around here
but hungry confederates.

09:19.642 --> 09:24.013
I don't understand.

09:24.048 --> 09:27.149
I just don't understand.

09:27.184 --> 09:29.652
What's happened to you?

09:30.269 --> 09:31.520
Why are you...

09:31.555 --> 09:34.023
why are you all quiet like this?

09:34.058 --> 09:37.159
None of you can speak?

09:37.194 --> 09:40.279
None of you can move.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.303
First meat i've had
in a couple of months, you hear?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.581
Wind... must be the wind.

10:32.616 --> 10:36.335
It has to be the wind.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.529
All right, in there,
you'd best come out now.

11:03.564 --> 11:05.414
You hear?

11:05.449 --> 11:09.168
You'd better come out now
or i'm coming in.

11:25.551 --> 11:28.688
Oh, well, old man.

11:28.723 --> 11:32.441
You don't know how close
you come to dying just then.

11:32.476 --> 11:34.310
Now, you'd better tell me

11:34.345 --> 11:37.446
just who you are
and what you're doing here.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.315
I was just about

11:39.350 --> 11:42.451
to ask you for the
same information, son.

11:42.486 --> 11:43.703
When i first seen you

11:43.738 --> 11:44.820
coming up the street,

11:44.855 --> 11:46.706
i thought you
was a yank.

11:46.741 --> 11:49.825
You don't know how close
youcome to dying.

11:49.860 --> 11:54.213
What was you going to use,
grandpa, that book?

11:54.248 --> 11:57.333
That's a pretty heavy thing
to be throwing.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.218
This book,

11:59.253 --> 12:01.721
but i wasn't aiming
to throw it...

12:01.756 --> 12:02.972
just use it...

12:03.007 --> 12:06.726
like i used it on them.

12:06.761 --> 12:09.228
I done that, you know.

12:09.263 --> 12:11.847
Put them all to sleep.

12:11.882 --> 12:16.235
You don't believe
me, do you?

12:16.270 --> 12:17.486
You think i'm lying.

12:17.521 --> 12:19.989
I ain't
called you no liar.

12:20.024 --> 12:21.857
Something happened
to 'em,

12:21.892 --> 12:24.360
but there must be
some natural explanation.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.611
They just couldn't...

12:28.783 --> 12:31.250
"natural explanation."

12:31.867 --> 12:33.119
Now, don't that take all.

12:33.154 --> 12:37.256
This here's
what done it.

12:37.291 --> 12:39.759
This here book.

12:46.132 --> 12:48.634
That wasn't
bright of you.

12:48.669 --> 12:51.137
That wasn't
bright of you at all.

12:51.172 --> 12:53.022
Listen, old man.

12:53.057 --> 12:54.890
You may be
harmless enough,

12:54.925 --> 12:57.026
but i got no time
to fiddle around

12:57.061 --> 12:58.277
with black magic

12:58.312 --> 13:00.146
or any other
old men's games.

13:00.181 --> 13:01.397
Games?

13:01.432 --> 13:03.282
Games, you call it?

13:03.317 --> 13:07.036
When there in front of you
stands the enemy?

13:07.071 --> 13:08.904
Not even a twitch?

13:08.939 --> 13:12.041
Not even a move
in the eyeball?

13:12.076 --> 13:13.909
Well!

13:17.081 --> 13:19.548
"Ye soldier, conjured here

13:19.583 --> 13:22.668
"in the name
of the prince of darkness,

13:22.703 --> 13:25.171
ye shall remain
silent and..."

13:25.206 --> 13:27.056
now, listen, old man...!

13:27.091 --> 13:30.810
How 'bout it now, johnny reb?

13:30.845 --> 13:31.427
You believe me?

13:31.462 --> 13:33.312
I reckon you
believe me now

13:33.347 --> 13:35.815
being as you can't
move a muscle.

13:35.850 --> 13:36.932
Being as you

13:36.967 --> 13:39.435
can't speak even
a word out loud

13:39.470 --> 13:43.189
you're just going to have to
stand there and listen to...

13:43.224 --> 13:45.074
listen to me speak at you.

13:45.691 --> 13:48.194
Oh, i know you
can still hear me

13:48.229 --> 13:51.330
'cause i only used
half the power.

13:51.365 --> 13:53.833
My name's teague.

13:53.868 --> 13:56.952
I lived down yon by the creek.

13:58.239 --> 14:01.957
I'm a witchman,
like my pappy 'fore me.

14:01.992 --> 14:05.711
He was the seventh son
of a seventh son,

14:05.746 --> 14:08.214
and i was his seventh son.

14:08.249 --> 14:11.967
I know conjure stuff
forward and backward

14:12.002 --> 14:13.469
and up and down.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.720
It's my living.

14:14.755 --> 14:18.974
And then the yanks come

14:19.009 --> 14:23.979
and all the people
run afore 'em... 'cept me.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.984
Invaders!

14:29.019 --> 14:30.870
Tyrants!

14:30.905 --> 14:35.241
Thieving skunks to boot!

14:35.276 --> 14:37.126
But i fixed them.

14:37.161 --> 14:39.628
I didn't do no la-dl-da.

14:39.663 --> 14:42.131
I opened the book,
and i read the words,

14:42.748 --> 14:47.136
and you can see
what happened to them.

14:47.171 --> 14:50.890
Now... now, you listen
to me, johnny reb.

14:50.925 --> 14:54.009
Your... your secession-

14:54.044 --> 14:56.512
you fight the yanks.

14:56.547 --> 15:00.266
Now, you be good and
don't give me no argument-

15:00.301 --> 15:02.151
blink your right eye.

15:03.938 --> 15:07.022
Now you'll be able
to move again

15:07.057 --> 15:09.775
as soon as i
read the words.

15:09.810 --> 15:12.278
"Ye soldier,
conjured here

15:12.313 --> 15:14.780
"in the name of the
prince of darkness,

15:14.815 --> 15:17.917
ye can now move and speak."

15:24.290 --> 15:25.541
Hypnotism.

15:25.576 --> 15:26.792
Hypnotism?

15:26.827 --> 15:28.043
Hypnotism?!

15:29.929 --> 15:31.797
This is conjure stuff.

15:39.054 --> 15:41.557
And what i done
to them yanks,

15:41.592 --> 15:44.059
i can do to the
whole union army-

15:44.094 --> 15:45.945
freeze 'em all
in their tracks.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.447
I can open up a
path to washington

15:48.482 --> 15:51.567
so that bobby lee
could ride in there

15:51.602 --> 15:54.703
with three confederate
troopers and take over

15:54.738 --> 15:55.955
the whole country.

15:55.990 --> 15:57.823
Magic.

15:57.858 --> 16:00.326
You claim it's magic.

16:00.361 --> 16:02.211
I don't claim it.

16:02.246 --> 16:03.462
I say it.

16:03.497 --> 16:07.216
Itismagic.

16:07.251 --> 16:11.587
It's what i read in the book

16:12.221 --> 16:15.975
and now... you seen it.

16:16.010 --> 16:18.477
You felt it.

16:18.512 --> 16:22.231
You mean you could...
you could do this

16:22.266 --> 16:24.483
to the whole
union army?

16:24.518 --> 16:29.738
Could and would.

16:29.773 --> 16:31.607
Why don't you, old man?

16:31.642 --> 16:33.492
Why don't you?

16:33.527 --> 16:38.497
For one good reason,
one good reason only.

16:38.532 --> 16:42.251
I'm goin' to die.

16:42.286 --> 16:48.507
Mm. I'm goin' to die
afore the sun goes down.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.010
I got a feelin' in my bones.

16:51.045 --> 16:54.129
I can smell death,
and hear it comin'

16:54.164 --> 16:57.883
on a white horse
galloping straight at me,

16:57.918 --> 17:00.386
galloping, galloping
straight at me.

17:01.020 --> 17:01.770
Old mr. Death

17:01.805 --> 17:04.272
come to pluck me
out of the livin'.

17:04.308 --> 17:06.141
So i ain't goin'
to be around

17:06.175 --> 17:08.277
to do what's got to be done.

17:08.311 --> 17:10.779
I'm leaving it
up to you.

17:10.814 --> 17:12.031
Me?

17:12.066 --> 17:17.903
I can tell about a man's looks,
his eyes, his head,

17:17.938 --> 17:19.154
hold on his weapon.

17:19.189 --> 17:22.290
I can tell all about that man...

17:23.791 --> 17:26.161
and i'm choosing you.

17:30.916 --> 17:35.304
You can find everything
you need in this book-

17:35.339 --> 17:42.177
spells, talisman,
curses, everything.

17:47.182 --> 17:48.434
Here.

17:48.469 --> 17:50.936
Take it.

17:52.821 --> 17:54.690
Don't seem right.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.943
Don't seem right at all.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.446
There's something...

18:00.481 --> 18:01.697
something unclean,

18:01.732 --> 18:06.085
like being in league with the...

18:06.120 --> 18:07.336
that's it.

18:07.371 --> 18:09.838
You got it right, johnny reb.

18:09.873 --> 18:13.592
You said it like it's got
the devil.

18:13.627 --> 18:17.713
That's who you're
in league with,

18:17.748 --> 18:20.849
the devil himself.

18:20.884 --> 18:27.723
That's who we'll have fighting
the devil.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.225
The devil.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.230
The devil.

18:36.231 --> 18:39.368
The devil.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.624
Halt. Who goes there?

18:45.659 --> 18:46.875
Paradine,
troop scout.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.995
Advance and be recognized.

18:56.251 --> 19:00.005
You've been gone a
long time, paradine.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.256
We give you up,

19:01.291 --> 19:04.393
dead or prisoner
by this time.

19:04.428 --> 19:05.644
Neither, lieutenant.

19:05.679 --> 19:10.015
Not time for either
of it, it appears.

19:10.050 --> 19:13.769
Well, a man's got to do
his reading, don't he.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.021
Well, out with it, man.

19:16.056 --> 19:17.272
What'd you see?

19:17.307 --> 19:19.158
More'n you'd believe,
lieutenant.

19:19.193 --> 19:21.026
Where was their advance party?

19:21.061 --> 19:23.529
We haven't heard a sound
from that valley all day.

19:23.564 --> 19:26.031
Their advance party's
in that town,

19:26.066 --> 19:28.534
and the main body's
spread out behind.

19:28.569 --> 19:30.419
Are you drunk or something?

19:30.454 --> 19:32.921
Now, there hasn't been a sound
from down there all day,

19:32.956 --> 19:35.424
not a sound.

19:35.459 --> 19:38.544
Lieutenant, you got
every right to call me mad,

19:38.579 --> 19:41.680
but the reason
you didn't hear 'em is...

19:41.715 --> 19:42.931
is they're all asleep.

19:42.966 --> 19:47.186
Put to sleep by magic-
black magic.

19:47.221 --> 19:49.054
It's right here
in this book.

19:49.089 --> 19:52.808
A little old man by the name
of teague- he done it.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.693
Paradine, the
order's out.

19:54.728 --> 19:57.196
You're to take
yourself to bed.

19:57.813 --> 19:59.064
You're to sleep
the night.

19:59.099 --> 20:01.567
Make your report to
me in the morning.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.569
This is my report, lieutenant.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.956
Where's mallory's troop?

20:07.991 --> 20:10.459
They went up the north ridge
late this morning.

20:10.494 --> 20:12.961
Yeah, there's a group of yankees
camped up there, wasn't there?

20:12.996 --> 20:14.830
Company strength at least,
wasn't there?

20:14.865 --> 20:16.081
That's what we figured?

20:16.116 --> 20:17.966
But what's that got to do
with all this?

20:18.001 --> 20:20.469
On the way back here,
lieutenant, i...

20:21.086 --> 20:22.971
i... i opened the book,

20:23.006 --> 20:24.840
and i read from a page of it.

20:24.875 --> 20:26.725
Halt. Who goes there?

20:26.760 --> 20:31.096
I conjured up a spell, and i...

20:31.131 --> 20:33.599
and i turned it in the direction
of that ridge.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.489
Mallory, paradine says...

20:44.243 --> 20:47.362
l-i just seen something
l-i can't explain

20:47.397 --> 20:51.116
no more'n any of my men
can explain it,

20:51.151 --> 20:53.001
but they seen it too.

20:53.036 --> 20:56.622
We was walking up that ridge
in the scrimmage line

20:56.657 --> 20:59.758
scared out of our boots,
'cause it was so quiet.

20:59.793 --> 21:01.627
We thought them yankees

21:01.662 --> 21:04.763
was waiting for us
just beyond the parapet.

21:04.798 --> 21:07.883
Yeah, they was waiting,
all right-

21:07.918 --> 21:12.271
standing straight and tall,
guns to port,

21:12.306 --> 21:13.889
frozen like statues.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.140
Dead?

21:15.175 --> 21:17.025
Not dead.

21:17.060 --> 21:20.779
Not dead
and not alive.

21:20.814 --> 21:26.151
Just frozen stock-still
like rocks.

21:26.186 --> 21:29.905
Lieutenant, this done it.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.407
Paradine, this is
the devil's work.

21:32.442 --> 21:34.910
Well, what's this
all about?

21:34.945 --> 21:38.046
This book- an old man
give it to me in town.

21:38.664 --> 21:40.048
It is the devil's work.

21:40.083 --> 21:41.300
I know that.

21:41.335 --> 21:45.053
But maybe it's time
we called muster on the devil.

21:45.088 --> 21:48.173
Maybe it's the only
thing left for us.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.058
We ain't got enough guns.

21:50.093 --> 21:51.927
We ain't got enough food.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.812
We ain't got enough of anything.

21:53.847 --> 21:55.681
We're losing, lieutenant.

21:55.716 --> 21:58.183
The confederacy's
cracking up into little pieces

21:58.218 --> 21:59.434
right in front of our eyes.

21:59.469 --> 22:01.937
It's bleeding to death
every day.

22:01.972 --> 22:05.691
We ain't got enough blood left
to make a change.

22:05.726 --> 22:08.193
I don't know much about satan,

22:08.228 --> 22:15.083
but this cause of ours is...
is dying right in front of us.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.841
Paradine, open up the book
and read from it out loud.

22:22.876 --> 22:27.212
Make it good for every
union soldier in the field.

22:27.247 --> 22:29.715
Freeze 'em. Put 'em
into the earth or something,

22:29.750 --> 22:32.851
but make it good.

22:37.856 --> 22:42.227
"Satan... satan,
i call upon you,

22:42.262 --> 22:44.112
"and in so doing

22:44.147 --> 22:46.615
i revoke the name of..."

22:51.620 --> 22:54.122
go on, joe, read it.

22:54.157 --> 22:58.493
He calls upon us to
revoke the name of god.

23:01.997 --> 23:05.133
Leave it be, dauger.

23:05.168 --> 23:06.385
You said yourself

23:06.420 --> 23:07.636
it's the only thing
we got left.

23:08.253 --> 23:10.138
He's right, paradine.

23:10.173 --> 23:13.258
God help us,
thatisall we have left.

23:13.293 --> 23:14.760
What do we call 'em?

23:14.795 --> 23:17.262
Damn yankees,
don't we, lieutenant?

23:17.297 --> 23:21.016
That's the phrase,
ain't it- "damn yanks"?

23:21.051 --> 23:23.518
If i read aloud
from this book,

23:23.553 --> 23:26.655
it'll be the confederacy
that's damned.

23:26.690 --> 23:28.523
It's that book
or it's the end.

23:28.558 --> 23:30.409
Then let it be the end!

23:30.444 --> 23:33.528
If it must come,
let it come.

23:33.563 --> 23:36.665
If this cause is to be buried

23:37.282 --> 23:41.036
let it be put
in hallowed ground.

23:43.538 --> 23:47.292
Let it be put
in hallowed ground.

23:47.327 --> 23:50.295
On the following morning,
sergeant paradine

23:50.330 --> 23:53.048
and the rest of these men
were moved up north

23:53.083 --> 23:55.550
to a little town
in pennsylvania,

23:55.585 --> 23:57.436
an obscure little place

23:57.471 --> 24:00.188
where a battle was brewing,
a town called gettysburg,

24:00.223 --> 24:01.440
and this one was fought

24:01.475 --> 24:03.942
without the help of the devil-
small historical note

24:04.559 --> 24:05.811
not to be found
in any known books

24:05.846 --> 24:11.450
but part of the records
in the twilight zone.

24:14.336 --> 24:17.239
Rod serling,
creator ofthe twilight zone,

24:17.274 --> 24:19.124
will tell you
about next week's story

24:19.159 --> 24:22.844
after this message.

24:22.879 --> 24:24.846
And now, mr. Serling.

24:24.881 --> 24:25.664
Next week onthe twilight zone

24:25.699 --> 24:28.800
we once again borrow the talents
of mr. Charles beaumont

24:28.835 --> 24:30.669
who's written a script
especially for us

24:30.704 --> 24:31.920
called "the jungle."

24:31.955 --> 24:33.171
Now this is designed

24:33.206 --> 24:35.056
for the reasonably
impressionable amongst you

24:35.091 --> 24:36.308
who find nothing to laugh about

24:36.343 --> 24:38.810
when somebody mentions
the words "black magic."

24:38.845 --> 24:41.930
Mr. John dehner stars
in another small excursion

24:41.965 --> 24:44.432
into the darker regions
of the imagination.

24:44.467 --> 24:46.935
Next week, "the jungle."

25:17.265 --> 25:19.134
This is james arness.

25:19.169 --> 25:21.019
You know, it's only a short hop

25:21.054 --> 25:23.522
fromthe twilight zone
to dodge city ingunsmoke.

25:23.557 --> 25:26.024
Saturday nights
over most of these stations.
