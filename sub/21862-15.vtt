<c.speaker>Winds shifted to starboard.

<c.speaker>Trim the jib sail!

01:29.125 --> 01:30.875
<c.speaker>Daniel?!

01:30.875 --> 01:33.708
<c.speaker>But, Scarlett, I thought
since you were captaining
this trip,

01:33.708 --> 01:35.583
<c.speaker>I might take
a little break.

01:37.208 --> 01:40.208
<c.speaker>Which I'll do right
after I trim the sail.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.291
<c.speaker>I hope we get
to Nueva Vista soon.

01:43.291 --> 01:44.875
<c.speaker>Me, too.

01:44.875 --> 01:46.125
<c.speaker>There's nothing like relaxing

01:46.125 --> 01:48.250
<c.speaker>on the terrace
of the Summer Palace,

01:48.250 --> 01:50.458
<c.speaker>basking
in the West Coast sun.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.166
<c.speaker>Right, Francisco?

01:52.166 --> 01:53.458
<c.speaker>[snoring]

01:53.458 --> 01:56.875
<c.speaker>Looks like <i>abuelo  </i>
has gotten a head start.

<c.speaker>Envision! Skylar!

02:00.333 --> 02:03.083

<c.speaker>And last but not least,
"Vanish"!

02:10.208 --> 02:12.333
<c.speaker>Vanish!

02:12.333 --> 02:14.291
<c.speaker>How many powers
does that thing have?

02:14.291 --> 02:16.166
<c.speaker>And can you test them
on something else?

02:16.166 --> 02:18.208
<c.speaker>I'd like my lasso back.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.583
<c.speaker>Captain Turner says
we're almost there!

02:22.583 --> 02:25.291
<c.speaker>You guys are going
to love Nueva Vista.

02:25.291 --> 02:28.416
<c.speaker>I remember going
fishing every summer
with my cousin, Cristóbal.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.250
<c.speaker>Wait, Esteban said
he was your only cousin.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.583
<c.speaker>Leave it to Esteban
to exaggerate.

02:33.583 --> 02:36.208
<c.speaker>Well, you'll have
plenty of time to reminisce
when we get there.

02:36.208 --> 02:38.875
<c.speaker>But right now,
you need to keep practicing.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.708
<c.speaker>Try to make
yourself vanish.

02:40.708 --> 02:42.208
<c.speaker>Myself?

02:42.208 --> 02:44.166
<c.speaker>I only know how to make
objects vanish.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.125
<c.speaker>It's going to take
some concentration,

02:46.125 --> 02:47.708
<c.speaker>but I know you can do it.

02:47.708 --> 02:48.833
<c.speaker>Okay.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.083
<c.speaker>Vanish!

02:53.458 --> 02:54.875
<c.speaker>Did it work?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.250
<c.speaker>-Not exactly.
-[gasps]

02:57.250 --> 03:00.625
<c.speaker>But you're <i>headed  </i>
in the right direction.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.250
<c.speaker>- [bell clanging]
- <i>Sirenas! Sirenas </i>ahoy!

03:07.250 --> 03:08.708
<c.speaker><i>Sirenas? </i>

03:08.708 --> 03:10.166
<c.speaker>[Gabe] <i>Sirenas?! </i>

03:10.166 --> 03:12.208
<c.speaker>Ooh, where?
I've never seen one before!

03:19.458 --> 03:21.208
<c.speaker>[Scarlett]
Nomes, take the wheel!

03:21.208 --> 03:22.875
<c.speaker>Daniel! The crossbow!

03:22.875 --> 03:25.875
<c.speaker>Wait! What are you-- ?
Crossbow?! What? Why?!

03:25.875 --> 03:28.458
<c.speaker><i>Sirenas </i>are dangerous!
Everyone knows that!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.208
<c.speaker>They sing a siren song
that puts sailors
into a trance.

03:31.208 --> 03:32.875
<c.speaker>Which makes them
crash their ships.

03:32.875 --> 03:35.083
<c.speaker>Captain Nuñez!
Get everyone below deck!

03:35.083 --> 03:36.958
<c.speaker>Aye, aye, Captain.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.166
<c.speaker>But they're not singing!

03:39.166 --> 03:42.125
<c.speaker>And I can't even remember
the last time <i>sirenas  </i>
caused a shipwreck.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.208
<c.speaker>-Whoa! Look out!
-[gasp]

03:45.208 --> 03:46.500
<c.speaker>[grunting]

03:46.500 --> 03:48.083
<c.speaker>We've gotta
get outta here!

03:51.458 --> 03:52.875
<c.speaker>Stop firing!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.291
<c.speaker>Blaze!

03:55.291 --> 03:56.625
<c.speaker>[grunts]

03:58.416 --> 04:01.000
<c.speaker>Whoa! Did you see
what she did?

04:01.000 --> 04:03.125
<c.speaker>Marzel, no!

04:03.125 --> 04:04.750
<c.speaker>They just tried
to fillet us!

04:04.750 --> 04:08.000
<c.speaker>But the princess stopped them
with that magic thingy!

04:08.000 --> 04:10.375
<c.speaker>So let's get out of here
before she uses it on us.

04:11.958 --> 04:14.458
<c.speaker>Oh, wait for me!

04:14.458 --> 04:15.875
<c.speaker>Why did you do that?!

04:15.875 --> 04:17.166
<c.speaker>I'm not going
to attack someone

04:17.166 --> 04:19.583
<c.speaker>who hasn't
attacked me first.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.083
<c.speaker><i>Sirenas </i>haven't sunk a ship
since before we were born.

04:29.083 --> 04:30.958
<c.speaker>And still the humans
come after us!

04:30.958 --> 04:33.250
<c.speaker>Because no one's
told them we changed.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.583
<c.speaker>Ah, they wouldn't listen.

04:34.583 --> 04:35.708
<c.speaker>Maybe the princess would.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.250
<c.speaker>You saw what she did.

04:40.333 --> 04:43.458
<c.speaker>Oh, no. I hate that look.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.000
<c.speaker>We can tell her,

04:45.000 --> 04:47.166
<c.speaker>and she'd spread the word
to the rest of the humans.

04:47.166 --> 04:49.083
<c.speaker>Huh! Keep on dreamin'.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.708
<c.speaker>It's what
she does best.

04:50.708 --> 04:52.583
<c.speaker>I'm going to talk to <i>Papá! </i>

04:52.583 --> 04:54.375
<c.speaker>You're wasting your time!

04:59.583 --> 05:01.000
<c.speaker>We're here!

05:01.000 --> 05:02.416
<c.speaker>Nueva Vista.

05:05.125 --> 05:07.208
<c.speaker>[Gabe] Whoa!

05:07.208 --> 05:08.250
<c.speaker>Look at that palace!

05:08.250 --> 05:09.291
<c.speaker>It's beautiful!

05:16.250 --> 05:18.458
<c.speaker>[bells ringing]

05:20.083 --> 05:22.458
<c.speaker>What is
that infernal sound?

05:22.458 --> 05:24.166
<c.speaker>Welcome bells.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.583
<c.speaker>Elena must have arrived
in Nueva Vista.

05:26.583 --> 05:31.000
<c.speaker>Hmph. Even from miles away,
that princess annoys me.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.083
<c.speaker>She won't be princess
for long,

05:33.083 --> 05:35.416
<c.speaker>now that you've mastered
the Scepter of Night.

05:35.416 --> 05:40.000
<c.speaker>Yes. This is
one family vacation
Elena will never forget.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.708

06:10.166 --> 06:12.458
<c.speaker>Cristóbal? You look--

06:12.458 --> 06:14.958
<c.speaker>Distinguished?

06:14.958 --> 06:17.500
<c.speaker>Oof. I was going to say
"different."

06:17.500 --> 06:20.250
<c.speaker>She was
going to say "old."

06:20.250 --> 06:22.958
<c.speaker>[laughing]
And she would be right.

06:22.958 --> 06:26.291
<c.speaker>We weren't all trapped
in a magical amulet
for 41 years.

06:26.291 --> 06:28.708
<c.speaker>Some of us had to carry on
in the real world.

06:28.708 --> 06:31.083
<c.speaker>Right, Esteban?
[hearty laugh]

06:31.083 --> 06:33.708
<c.speaker>I've missed you, <i>primo. </i>

06:33.708 --> 06:36.000
<c.speaker>And I have
missed you, too!

06:36.000 --> 06:38.708
<c.speaker>[laughing]

06:38.708 --> 06:42.208
<c.speaker>Which is why we are
throwing a <i>Festival </i>

06:42.208 --> 06:45.291
<c.speaker>to honor you
for defeating Shuriki.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.125
<c.speaker>Yeah, about that...

06:48.125 --> 06:52.000
<c.speaker>Shuriki is not
as defeated as we thought.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.958
<c.speaker>[gasp] She's alive?

06:53.958 --> 06:55.708
<c.speaker>And more powerful
than ever.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.291
<c.speaker>As are you, I'm told.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.708
<c.speaker>But no matter
how strong Shuriki is,

<c.speaker>Well, it was

09:42.458 --> 09:45.208
<c.speaker>until we ran
into those wretched <i>sirenas. </i>

<c.speaker>[gasps] Did they
attack your ship?

09:46.875 --> 09:47.958
<c.speaker>They were about to.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.708
<c.speaker>We don't know that.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.208
<c.speaker>Mateo said they haven't
crashed a ship in years,

09:52.208 --> 09:55.166
<c.speaker>and I don't remember them
ever being a problem
when I visited.

09:55.166 --> 09:58.125
<c.speaker>That's because your parents
protected you from the truth.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.250
<c.speaker>But it's time you knew.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.291
<c.speaker>Your father never told you

10:05.291 --> 10:06.708
<c.speaker>My papá.

10:06.708 --> 10:10.000
<c.speaker>He was aboard that ship,
on his way home.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.125
<c.speaker>I'm so sorry.
I didn't realize.

10:14.125 --> 10:16.166
<c.speaker>Well, now you do.

10:16.166 --> 10:20.458
<c.speaker>If I could, I'd lock them
all up in the tower.

10:20.458 --> 10:24.458
<c.speaker>It's only a matter of time
before they strike again.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.458
<c.speaker>I understand, Cristóbal.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.375
<c.speaker>I know you do.

10:28.375 --> 10:31.291
<c.speaker>Now enough
of my wallowing.

10:31.291 --> 10:32.750
<c.speaker>Dessert awaits!

11:01.250 --> 11:02.833
<c.speaker>Papá!

11:02.833 --> 11:03.833
<c.speaker>General Daria informed us

11:03.833 --> 11:05.083
<c.speaker>that you and your brother

11:05.083 --> 11:08.000
<c.speaker>were spotted
near a human ship?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.583
<c.speaker>Busted!

11:09.583 --> 11:13.750
<c.speaker>It's time we told
the humans we've changed.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.208
<c.speaker>The Princess of Avalor
was aboard that ship.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.208
<c.speaker>I think she would listen.

11:18.208 --> 11:21.000
<c.speaker>Before or after
her guards harpoon us?

11:21.000 --> 11:23.291
<c.speaker>Probably after.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.000
<c.speaker>What if her guards
weren't around?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.833
<c.speaker>After all these years
of conflict,

11:26.833 --> 11:28.416
<c.speaker>isn't it worth a try?

11:32.208 --> 11:36.250
<c.speaker>Marisa, your heart
is in the right place.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.166
<c.speaker>It always is.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.208
<c.speaker>But heart alone
cannot change the world.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.958
<c.speaker>They despise our kind,
and with good reason.

11:44.958 --> 11:48.708
<c.speaker>So, no, I will not let you
or any other sirena
in Coronado

11:48.708 --> 11:50.208
<c.speaker>approach the humans.

11:50.208 --> 11:53.208
<c.speaker>-But maybe--
-King Pescoro has spoken!

11:53.208 --> 11:55.708
<c.speaker>That's right, Ocho.
He has.

11:55.708 --> 11:57.208
<c.speaker>[Ocho] Hmm!

11:57.208 --> 11:59.708
<c.speaker>Leave it alone, <i>mija,  </i>
for your own good.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.083
<c.speaker>Camila.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.750
<c.speaker>Mamá, you know
more than anyone

12:03.750 --> 12:06.208
<c.speaker>how much we have
in common with them.

12:06.208 --> 12:10.708
<c.speaker>If I thought it were
possible to make amends
with the humans, I'd try.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.166
<c.speaker>But I know them too well.

12:13.166 --> 12:16.583
<c.speaker>The best thing we can do
is to avoid their ships.

12:16.583 --> 12:19.833
<c.speaker>Which is what I expect you
to do from now on.

12:28.333 --> 12:29.958
<c.speaker>Hate to say
I told you so.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.250
<c.speaker>No, you don't.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.291
<c.speaker>Yeah, it's like
your favorite thing to say.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.250
<c.speaker>I'm going to talk
to her anyway.

12:36.250 --> 12:38.708
<c.speaker>But you heard Papá,
our King?

12:38.708 --> 12:41.958
<c.speaker>I heard him. And I
respectfully disagree.

12:43.583 --> 12:47.708
<c.speaker>Well, you got to admire the way
she blows off a royal order.

12:47.708 --> 12:50.125
<c.speaker>[sighs]

12:50.125 --> 12:52.708
<c.speaker>She has no idea
what she's getting into.

12:52.708 --> 12:56.333
<c.speaker>As usual. But it's fine,
'cause you're gonna go
after her

12:56.333 --> 12:58.125
<c.speaker>and make sure
she doesn't get hurt.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.166
<c.speaker>Also, as usual.

13:01.166 --> 13:03.250
<c.speaker>Ay, Marisa! Wait up!

13:04.291 --> 13:05.750
<c.speaker>Told ya so!

13:07.875 --> 13:10.458
<c.speaker>Yes, this should all
work out quite nicely.

13:10.458 --> 13:13.166
<c.speaker>-[Victor] Shuriki?
-[horse huffs]

13:13.166 --> 13:16.166
<c.speaker>Finally.
Took you long enough.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.000
<c.speaker>If you had let us ride
on the jaquins with you--

13:18.000 --> 13:19.333
<c.speaker>Carla!

13:19.333 --> 13:23.416
<c.speaker>Now that we're all here,
we can get started.

13:23.416 --> 13:26.125
<c.speaker>Ooh, I can't wait to see
Princess Elena's face

13:26.125 --> 13:28.083
<c.speaker>when we surprise her
in Nueva Vista!

13:28.083 --> 13:29.458
<c.speaker>And I can't wait
to kick up my paws

13:29.458 --> 13:31.375
<c.speaker>and rest my achin' wings.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.625
<c.speaker>It's a long way
'cross this kingdom.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.125
<c.speaker>There won't be
any time for rest.

13:35.125 --> 13:37.000
<c.speaker>We have to protect
our princess in case of--

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
<c.speaker>-[Skylar] Shuriki!
-Exactly.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.750
<c.speaker>No, I mean, Shuriki's
down there! Look!

13:43.125 --> 13:44.458
<c.speaker>Attack formation!

13:44.458 --> 13:46.166
<c.speaker>-What formation?
-Just dive!

13:47.708 --> 13:50.708
<c.speaker>[gasp] Shuriki!
We've got trouble!

13:50.708 --> 13:53.166
<c.speaker>Or target practice.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.166
<c.speaker>Obscure!

13:54.166 --> 13:55.583
<c.speaker>Ohh!

13:55.583 --> 13:57.416
<c.speaker>I can't see a thing!

13:58.583 --> 14:01.458
<c.speaker>Oof! Hah! Where are they?!

14:01.458 --> 14:03.083
<c.speaker>[sighs]

14:03.083 --> 14:04.125
<c.speaker>Gone.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.458
<c.speaker>We better tell the princess.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.166
<c.speaker>-Shuriki's here?!
-With the others.

14:09.166 --> 14:11.583
<c.speaker>And she's learned
some nasty new
scepter tricks.

14:11.583 --> 14:14.083
<c.speaker>Maybe we should
postpone the parade.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.500
<c.speaker>Nonsense!

14:15.500 --> 14:18.583
<c.speaker>The people have waited
too long to see their princess.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.458
<c.speaker>I'll instruct my captain
to beef up security.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.583
<c.speaker>You'll be perfectly safe.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.208
<c.speaker>Okay.
But if we're doing this,

14:25.208 --> 14:27.125
<c.speaker>I'm going to scout
the parade route.

14:27.125 --> 14:28.125
<c.speaker>I'll go with you.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.208
<c.speaker>Naomi and I will search

14:29.208 --> 14:30.583
<c.speaker>the rest of city
on the jaquins.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.875
<c.speaker>I'll have my guards
join the hunt.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.250
<c.speaker>You ready?

14:46.833 --> 14:50.416
<c.speaker>[singing siren song]

14:50.416 --> 14:52.875
<c.speaker>Huh?

14:52.875 --> 14:55.125
<c.speaker>[siren song continuing]

15:10.083 --> 15:12.458
<c.speaker>[gasp] Marisa,
what are you doing?

15:13.708 --> 15:15.291
<c.speaker>[gasp]

15:17.083 --> 15:19.500
<c.speaker>What?!
Don't make me use this!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.875
<c.speaker>Ooh! She took out
her magic thingy!

15:21.875 --> 15:24.166
<c.speaker>Let's get outta here!

15:24.166 --> 15:25.333
<c.speaker>Don't be scared.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.000
<c.speaker>I'm Princess Marisa
of Coronado,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
<c.speaker>this is my brother,
Prince Marzel,

15:29.000 --> 15:30.708
<c.speaker>and our friend, Cuco.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.208
<c.speaker>[clears throat]

15:32.208 --> 15:33.833
<c.speaker>[frightened yelp]

15:33.833 --> 15:35.583
<c.speaker>We just want to talk to you.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.500
<c.speaker>Whoa!
Can you all do that?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.625
<c.speaker>Just me
and my brother. Whaa!

15:45.625 --> 15:47.291
<c.speaker>Marisa!

15:47.291 --> 15:51.250
<c.speaker>Sorry. I haven't been
on legs in a long time.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.125
<c.speaker>Come on.
What's so hard about--

15:53.125 --> 15:54.125
<c.speaker>Whoa! Ohh!

15:54.125 --> 15:55.625
<c.speaker>[crash]

15:55.625 --> 15:58.125
<c.speaker>Eh, it's his first time
out of the water.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.000
<c.speaker>I got it. [click]

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
<c.speaker>What is it you want
to talk about?

16:06.250 --> 16:08.458
<c.speaker>-Uh...
-[music playing]

16:08.458 --> 16:12.083
<c.speaker>I'm sure you've heard
of all the terrible things
the sirenas have done.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.458
<c.speaker>And they're all true.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.375
<c.speaker>But that's
not the whole story.

18:53.625 --> 18:56.416
<c.speaker>A lot of people lost
their lives in those shipwrecks,

18:56.416 --> 18:58.250
<c.speaker>including my uncle.

<c.speaker>I wish I could undo the past.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.708
<c.speaker>But all I can do
is give you my promise

19:05.708 --> 19:07.458
<c.speaker>that those days are long gone.

19:10.333 --> 19:12.625
<c.speaker>I believe you, Marisa.

19:12.625 --> 19:15.583
<c.speaker>But we'll also need
to convince Duke Cristóbal.

19:15.583 --> 19:17.583
<c.speaker>He's in charge
of Nueva Vista.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.875
<c.speaker>Then bring him here,
and we'll convince him.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.708
<c.speaker>Okay.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.875
<c.speaker>You spoke to the <i>sirenas?! </i>

19:29.875 --> 19:32.625
<c.speaker>Yes, and they stopped
sinking ships years ago.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.291
<c.speaker>They want peace with us.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.333
<c.speaker>The princess of the sirenas
told me herself.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.875
<c.speaker>She did? When?

19:37.875 --> 19:40.083
<c.speaker>Just now.
In the canals.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.875
<c.speaker>Come with me and listen
to what she has to say.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.291
<c.speaker>Please, cousin.

19:49.583 --> 19:51.083
<c.speaker>[sighs]

19:51.083 --> 19:52.708
<c.speaker>For you, Elena...

19:52.708 --> 19:53.708
<c.speaker>I will.

19:58.083 --> 20:00.250
<c.speaker>Oh! Uh, the guards
should stay back.

20:00.250 --> 20:01.875
<c.speaker>I don't want
to scare them off.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.291
<c.speaker>This way.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.250
<c.speaker>I don't see anything.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.833
<c.speaker>They were just here!

20:10.833 --> 20:13.708
<c.speaker>Marisa?! Marzel?!

20:13.708 --> 20:15.333
<c.speaker>Oh, good.

20:15.333 --> 20:17.833
<c.speaker>This is my cousin,
Duke Cristóbal.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.833
<c.speaker>I am so glad
to finally meet you.

20:19.833 --> 20:24.166
<c.speaker>[laughs] I've been wanting
to meet you, too.

20:24.166 --> 20:25.500
<c.speaker>Guards! Seize them!

20:27.458 --> 20:28.708
<c.speaker>-What?!
-It's a trap!

20:28.708 --> 20:30.083
<c.speaker>Cristóbal, no!

20:31.250 --> 20:32.208
<c.speaker>[groaning]

20:32.208 --> 20:33.208
<c.speaker>Stop!

20:35.250 --> 20:37.625
<c.speaker>-Marzel!
-C'mon!

20:37.625 --> 20:39.000
<c.speaker>They're getting away!

20:39.000 --> 20:40.625
<c.speaker>[grunting]

20:42.083 --> 20:43.458
<c.speaker>Why did you do that?!

20:43.458 --> 20:45.708
<c.speaker>The <i>sirenas </i>came
to discuss peace.

20:45.708 --> 20:48.125
<c.speaker>That's what they
wanted you to believe.

20:48.125 --> 20:52.458
<c.speaker><i>Sirenas </i>lure humans
with their song
and their lies.

20:52.458 --> 20:55.083
<c.speaker>But I don't think that's
what they were trying to do!

20:55.083 --> 20:57.166
<c.speaker>I've dealt with them
my whole life.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.833
<c.speaker>You just met them.

20:58.833 --> 21:01.333
<c.speaker>I already lost my papá.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.833
<c.speaker>I don't want
to lose you, too, <i>prima. </i>

21:03.833 --> 21:05.958
<c.speaker>You understand that,
don't you?

21:07.833 --> 21:09.208
<c.speaker>Of course.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.333
<c.speaker>Good. Ha!

21:11.333 --> 21:13.291
<c.speaker>Then let's get
back to the palace.

21:13.291 --> 21:16.375
<c.speaker>We have a big day
ahead of us tomorrow.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.708
<c.speaker>I knew we couldn't
trust her!

21:20.708 --> 21:23.166
<c.speaker>But she looked
as surprised as us!

21:23.166 --> 21:24.250
<c.speaker>Grow up, Marisa!

21:24.250 --> 21:25.875
<c.speaker>They hate our kind
and always will!

21:37.208 --> 21:38.166
<c.speaker>[sighs]

21:50.375 --> 21:53.125
<c.speaker>Who's ready
for a masquerade parade?!

21:53.125 --> 21:54.083
<c.speaker>[laughing]

21:54.083 --> 21:55.458
<c.speaker>[laughing]

21:57.083 --> 21:59.083
<c.speaker>[sighs]

21:59.083 --> 22:01.250
<c.speaker>Is everything okay,
<i>mijita? </i>

22:01.250 --> 22:02.583
<c.speaker>Uh, I'm fine.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
<c.speaker>Elena,
as the guest of honor,

22:09.000 --> 22:11.416
<c.speaker>you alone will ride
on the last float.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.500
<c.speaker>With all due respect,
Your Excellency,

22:13.500 --> 22:16.583
<c.speaker>Elena should be with us
in case anything happens.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.625
<c.speaker>If you must.

22:18.625 --> 22:22.833
<c.speaker>Just try not to get
in the way of the people
seeing their Crown Princess.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.583
<c.speaker>[festive music playing]

22:26.708 --> 22:29.375
<c.speaker>Whoa! It sounds like
the whole city showed up.

22:29.375 --> 22:32.250
<c.speaker>We'll have to keep
a sharp lookout for Shuriki.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.250
<c.speaker>If she's out there,
we'll spot her.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.458
<c.speaker>Here we go.

22:41.708 --> 22:45.416
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

22:45.416 --> 22:49.208
<c.speaker>[Elena]
What? What's going on?

22:51.583 --> 22:53.750
<c.speaker>[gasps]

22:56.958 --> 23:00.000
<c.speaker>I think they're costumes.
For the parade.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.583
<c.speaker>How will we know which one
is the real Shuriki?

23:06.500 --> 23:08.291
<c.speaker>Look!
It's Victor and Carla!

23:09.291 --> 23:10.291
<c.speaker>I'll go after Victor!

23:10.291 --> 23:11.958
<c.speaker>I'll get Carla!

23:11.958 --> 23:13.500
<c.speaker>She's a <i>malvago </i>now,
you'll need help!

23:13.500 --> 23:14.958
<c.speaker>[cheers and whistles]

23:16.375 --> 23:20.166
<c.speaker>Just keep smiling.
No need to alarm everyone.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.875
<c.speaker>I have a surprise for you.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.083
<c.speaker>Fire away!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.708
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

23:43.083 --> 23:45.125
<c.speaker>Why are we turning here?

23:45.125 --> 23:47.166
<c.speaker>Shouldn't we be following
the other floats?

23:48.291 --> 23:49.875
<c.speaker>Hey!

23:59.250 --> 24:00.625
<c.speaker>Fiero?

24:03.583 --> 24:04.875
<c.speaker>Shuriki?

24:04.875 --> 24:07.583
<c.speaker>This is no mask, Elena.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.250
<c.speaker>You're stalling.

24:15.250 --> 24:16.458
<c.speaker>So are you.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.125
<c.speaker>-Inferno!
-Blaze!

24:24.166 --> 24:25.208
<c.speaker><i>Boqato! </i>

24:25.208 --> 24:27.000
<c.speaker>Aah!

24:33.625 --> 24:35.583
<c.speaker>Please work. Vanish!

24:39.250 --> 24:42.416
<c.speaker>Guess you haven't mastered
that power yet.

24:42.416 --> 24:43.583
<c.speaker>Chaos!

24:44.750 --> 24:46.333
<c.speaker>Oh! What's-- ?

24:46.333 --> 24:47.416
<c.speaker>Unh!

24:47.416 --> 24:50.083
<c.speaker>[laughs] Inferno!

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
<c.speaker>[Shuriki laughs]
