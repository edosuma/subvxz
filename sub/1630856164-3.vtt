10:57.198 --> 10:58.533
Mm-hmm.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.784
Just like his daddy.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.703
Hip hip hooray for DNA, huh?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.621
(babbling)

11:03.705 --> 11:05.081
I'll just...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.960
(Janelle baby-talking)

11:09.002 --> 11:10.712
Brought the child support.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.839
Thank you.
Oh, say "Thank you, Daddy."

11:12.922 --> 11:14.257
-(laughs)
-(chuckles)

11:14.299 --> 11:15.675
-You want to hold Ray Jr.?
-Oh, yeah, sure.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.635
Go to Daddy. Go to Daddy.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.888
Look at you, little man!
How you doin'?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.973
-Say, "I'm off the titty now."
-What?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.183
"So I'm eating solid food."

11:23.266 --> 11:24.976
Well, that's great.
(laughs)

11:25.018 --> 11:26.853
When you gonna quit
the titty, Ray?

11:30.607 --> 11:32.400
I know, I know.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.820
Does your brother know about
your little side hustle?

11:35.862 --> 11:37.864
Hell no. That pussy
would've shut me down

11:37.947 --> 11:39.741
in a New York second.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.826
Not that it matters now.
I'm done.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.453
You're lucky to be alive.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.996
Fuckin' biker gang had a drone.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.582
When did biker gangs get drones?

11:47.665 --> 11:49.751
You know the most dangerous
part of the pot business?

11:49.834 --> 11:51.503
-What?
-When I started,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.129
I weighed 140 pounds.

11:53.171 --> 11:55.298
Seriously, I looked like Jesus.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.178
I finally get good at something
and now I got to give it up.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.846
Mm-mm. The only thing
you need to give up

12:01.930 --> 12:03.973
is thinking of yourself
as a drug dealer.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.266
But that's what I am.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.061
Au contraire.
You're a shaman.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.188
What the fuck
are you talking about?

12:10.271 --> 12:15.026
Mushrooms are a pathway to
love, truth, transcendence.

12:15.110 --> 12:18.655
You're not dealing drugs.
You're dealing enlightenment.

12:18.697 --> 12:20.031
Ergo, a shaman.

12:20.073 --> 12:20.949
Shut up.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.409
And the best part is,

12:22.492 --> 12:24.744
shrooms have a set market price.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.371
But you add
a little hand-holding,

12:26.454 --> 12:29.249
some guided therapy--
you know, witch doctor shit--

12:29.332 --> 12:31.626
and the fiscal rewards
are infinite.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.211
So, go legit?

12:33.294 --> 12:36.506
Well, it's still completely
illegal, but yeah.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.300
Lorraine Colavito, shaman.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.263
I don't know why, but I picture
you wearing some kind of hat.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.851
Try not to talk.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.019
Got it.

12:49.060 --> 12:51.438
-Seriously.
-Not a word.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.901
BROOK:
Oh, damn.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.654
Nice to see you, too.
Is Junior around?

12:59.738 --> 13:02.407
Ray Jr., your daddy's here!

13:03.366 --> 13:06.703
Oh, I see you're still
hanging out with this lowlife.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.038
Afraid so.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.374
-Hey!
-Hi, Dad.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.709
Hey, Junior!

13:12.751 --> 13:13.918
How's the champ doing?

13:13.960 --> 13:15.628
-You been a good boy?
-No.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.172
I was talking to him.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.257
-Yes.
-Yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.301
Hey, I know you wanted
one of those PlayStations.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.762
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks!

13:23.803 --> 13:25.013
You need help setting this up?

13:25.096 --> 13:26.973
No, Rocko can help me.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.808
-Who's Rocko? Who's Rocko?
-All right. Go inside.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.644
-RAY JR.: Bye, Dad.
-RAY: Bye.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.730
A little help, please.

13:33.772 --> 13:37.108
(grunts)
Okay.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.486
Here's your child support.

13:39.569 --> 13:40.987
BROOK:
Thanks.

13:41.071 --> 13:43.239
And what's up with you?
Cat got your tongue?

13:45.617 --> 13:46.951
(scoffs)

13:49.954 --> 13:51.331
Let's go.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.169
You see what I did back there?

13:56.252 --> 13:57.671
-Yeah, I saw.
-You know Penn & Teller?

13:57.754 --> 13:59.631
-Mm-hmm.
-I was doing Teller.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.262
(Ray groans)

14:06.304 --> 14:08.515
(knocking)

14:09.808 --> 14:10.725
(cheering over TV)

14:10.809 --> 14:12.310
(shrieks)

14:15.230 --> 14:16.481
DANNY:
When you were a kid,

14:16.564 --> 14:18.566
did they teach
sex education in school?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.151
Yeah, sure.

14:20.235 --> 14:23.029
Were you sick the day
they explained condoms?

14:24.823 --> 14:26.783
(phone vibrates)

14:26.825 --> 14:28.118
What the fuck does he want?

14:28.159 --> 14:30.328
-Who?
-Walt Disney.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.831
Oh, this is gonna be good.
Put it on speaker.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.374
Yeah, Walt.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.834
WALT (over phone):
Greetings from Anaheim!

14:35.917 --> 14:37.460
I'm here with Danny.
What's up?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.170
WALT:
♪ Danny-Danny fo-fanny ♪

14:39.212 --> 14:40.880
♪ Banana-fana fo-fanny,
Danny ♪

14:40.964 --> 14:42.590
Funny every time, Walt.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.592
Hey, so listen,
I hooked a real Shamu,

14:44.676 --> 14:46.553
and need to lay off
some of the action.

14:46.636 --> 14:47.637
Who's the whale?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.055
If you don't mind,

14:49.139 --> 14:50.056
I'd rather lay
the details on you

14:50.140 --> 14:51.975
faccia a faccia.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.769
It's face to face. Sorry.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.521
I was trying something.

14:56.604 --> 14:58.189
Didn't work.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.154
Hey, gentlemen.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.072
-Hey, Walt.
-Walt.

15:06.156 --> 15:09.367
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.744
No problem.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.662
I took the liberty of ordering
a couple martinis.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.205
Hope that's okay.

15:14.247 --> 15:17.667
Eugene, we're gonna need
a very tall seafood tower.

15:17.709 --> 15:20.045
-Make my nose bleed.
-Very good, Mr. Dinty.

15:20.128 --> 15:21.713
All right. Thanks, bud.

15:21.755 --> 15:22.922
Please tell me no allergies.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.549
-No, we're fine.
-(groans)

15:24.632 --> 15:26.801
I got a stepsister, she
even looks at a shrimp cocktail,

15:26.885 --> 15:28.553
blows up like a balloon.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.055
We almost lost her
on prom night.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.307
-We're good.
-(chuckling) Okay, okay.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.975
So, what brings you up the 405?

15:34.059 --> 15:36.227
Oh, okay. Right to it.
Huh? No lube?

15:36.269 --> 15:37.562
RAY:
Jesus. How are you?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.105
How are the kids?
They grow up so fast.

15:39.189 --> 15:40.315
Come on now.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.858
Okay!

15:41.900 --> 15:45.111
I got a guy looking to bet
a hundred grand a game,

15:45.195 --> 15:47.364
maybe three, four times a week.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.408
400 grand, maximum exposure.

15:50.492 --> 15:51.618
We'd cover two.

15:51.701 --> 15:54.120
Uh... you know,
let's-let's play it safe

15:54.204 --> 15:56.581
and say 500, 250 each?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.040
That's safe?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.376
My sphincter could
bend steel right now.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.127
I mean, if it's too rich
for you guys,

16:01.211 --> 16:03.004
-I totally understand.
-Don't condescend.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.297
Well, then don't wet
your panties.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.924
Why isn't your guy
betting in Vegas?

16:06.007 --> 16:08.259
He certainly could get
a free room at those numbers.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.594
WALT:
Because he's smart.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.721
Huh? No paper trail,
there's no taxes.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.139
What else do you know about him?

16:13.223 --> 16:14.891
WALT:
Well, let's see.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.726
He is of the Asian persuasion.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.353
Not that that matters,
I'm colorblind.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
He has factories in Cambodia

16:20.980 --> 16:23.149
that make high-end sneakers.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.735
There may be children
on the assembly lines,

16:25.777 --> 16:26.778
I do not ask.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.155
Uh, moved here in 2009,

16:29.239 --> 16:30.949
and financed a bunch
of slasher films

16:30.990 --> 16:35.328
so he can meet young ingenues
of the Caucasian persuasion.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.456
That enough?
You guys need more?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.834
-Yeah, is he any good?
-(forced laugh)

16:40.917 --> 16:42.293
Well, he thinks he is.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.379
That's all that really
matters, am I right?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.757
(sighs)

16:47.799 --> 16:49.634
You know, we'd have to agree
on the point spread

16:49.718 --> 16:51.302
before we take any bets.

16:51.386 --> 16:53.805
-Yeah, yeah, of course.
-What if instead of paying us,

16:53.847 --> 16:56.224
he decides to jump on a plane
and disappear?

16:56.307 --> 16:58.476
Well, that would be
very disappointing, right?

16:58.560 --> 17:01.563
But what if he loses
16 weeks in a row

17:01.646 --> 17:03.273
and we all retire?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.152
Talk to me.
How's your sphincter?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.863
WALT:
Whoa!

17:09.945 --> 17:11.573
I hope none of you guys
are keeping Kosher.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.700
You guys mind if I get
a quick shot of this?

17:13.782 --> 17:15.117
I'll make it a vid.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.244
You guys mind
if I get a vid of this?

17:19.955 --> 17:22.334
-I'm home.
-(drops keys)

17:24.711 --> 17:26.338
Anybody?

17:26.421 --> 17:28.631
What's the fuck
with these candles?

17:35.847 --> 17:37.265
What are you doing?

17:38.016 --> 17:39.267
What are you doing?

17:39.351 --> 17:41.436
I was setting the mood.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.314
Oh.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.233
How do you like my new bag?

17:47.317 --> 17:50.278
Well, it's not the first thing
I noticed, but...

17:50.362 --> 17:52.405
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

17:54.115 --> 17:56.534
Anthony's on Discord.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.456
(grunts)

18:04.959 --> 18:07.087
I'm guessing
you got the purse at Neiman's?

18:07.170 --> 18:08.213
(mouth full):
Saks.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.547
(grunts)
You're welcome.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.633
No. "Saks."

18:11.716 --> 18:13.551
Oh. Saks.

18:13.635 --> 18:14.844
Nice.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.138
(phone vibrating)

18:18.056 --> 18:20.016
Don't.

18:20.058 --> 18:21.518
It's Ray.

18:21.559 --> 18:23.061
-Could be important.
-Think it through, Danny.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.730
You're right, you're right.
(exhales)

18:25.772 --> 18:27.273
Carry on.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.152
-(vibrating continues)
-(grunts)

18:31.236 --> 18:32.862
-(recorded): Hi, this is Danny.
-(water running)

18:32.904 --> 18:34.239
-Go.
-Aw, fuck.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.493
(sighs): I'm sorry, Walt,
I can't get him.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.829
(sighs) Game's kicking off
in five minutes.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.414
I need an answer.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.415
See this?

18:43.498 --> 18:45.750
I used to live here.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.795
-We're in.
-Balls the size of Montana.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.672
-I love it!
-(line disconnects)

18:50.714 --> 18:53.133
(breathing heavily)

18:53.925 --> 18:55.802
(exhales sharply)

18:55.885 --> 18:57.804
Sweet Jesus in heaven,

18:57.887 --> 19:00.849
I never ask you for much,
but I'm asking you for this.

19:00.932 --> 19:04.728
Please let the Broncos lose
by at least six.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.812
What are you doing?

19:05.895 --> 19:07.856
Praying.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.691
Is everything okay?

19:09.774 --> 19:10.817
(sighs)

19:10.900 --> 19:11.818
No.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.445
Oh, baby.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.196
Hang on. I got something
that'll make you feel better.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.115
-What?
-I'm gonna make you some tea.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.450
No caffeine, right?

19:18.533 --> 19:19.325
No.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.369
Wouldn't do that to you.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.122
You can check your phone now.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.623
-You sure?
-(chuckles)

19:25.707 --> 19:27.709
Unless you got another round
in the chamber.

19:27.792 --> 19:28.710
Yeah. I do not.

19:28.793 --> 19:29.711
(giggles)

19:29.753 --> 19:31.463
I'll be right back.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.757
Maybe in the morning?

19:33.798 --> 19:35.842
(footsteps departing)

19:41.139 --> 19:42.098
I got to go!

19:42.140 --> 19:43.558
Thanks for the blow job!

19:43.641 --> 19:45.852
-(indistinct chatter)
-(cheering over TVs)

19:53.610 --> 19:55.153
Rayfield.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.988
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.450
Rayfield?!

20:01.659 --> 20:03.370
Rayfield!

20:05.413 --> 20:07.207
Oh, look, there's your brother.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.208
Danny!

20:08.291 --> 20:09.668
Hey!

20:09.709 --> 20:11.252
Oh, thank God.

20:11.336 --> 20:12.337
What was the spread?

20:12.379 --> 20:14.005
Oh, I want to say...

20:14.047 --> 20:15.256
six.

20:15.340 --> 20:17.842
-You want to?
-Danny, go easy.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.179
-♪ Easy like Sunday morning. ♪
-(chuckling)

20:21.221 --> 20:22.514
The fuck's wrong with you?

20:22.597 --> 20:24.265
I thought
you liked that old corny shit.

20:24.349 --> 20:25.183
Are you high?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.059
Am I high?

20:26.142 --> 20:27.018
You're high.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.019
He's high.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.479
Oh. Well,

20:29.521 --> 20:32.565
was he high
when he committed us to $200,000

20:32.649 --> 20:35.235
on a Monday
fucking Night Football game?!

20:35.318 --> 20:36.486
I don't know. Let me ask him.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.363
-Ray, honey?
-Huh?

20:38.405 --> 20:40.198
Were you high
when you took the bet?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.282
What bet?

20:41.366 --> 20:42.367
Oh, fuck.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.868
(whispers):
Oh, fuck.

20:44.869 --> 20:47.038
I have so many children.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.542
(birds chirping)

20:50.625 --> 20:53.086
Fucking field goal kicker.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.462
I could have him killed.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.714
-(chuckles): That's funny.
-Good one.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.090
Uh-uh.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.384
-Mm-mm.
-$440,000.

20:59.426 --> 21:00.635
You want to count it?

21:00.719 --> 21:01.428
No, sir.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.679
I'd kind of like to...

21:02.721 --> 21:03.888
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

21:03.972 --> 21:05.390
Okay.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.601
Excuse me, is that one
of those Mille watches?

21:08.685 --> 21:10.937
Yes. These are very expensive.

21:11.021 --> 21:13.940
I bought it from a crazy Jew
for $180,000, cash.

21:14.024 --> 21:14.983
You can't afford.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.484
(footsteps approaching)

21:17.819 --> 21:19.487
Jack, I'm hungry.

21:19.571 --> 21:20.780
When are we going?

21:20.864 --> 21:22.574
Go make yourself
crackers and cheese.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.576
-Okay?
-You know I don't eat wheat.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.120
Okay, then just the cheese!
Get out!

21:27.203 --> 21:28.329
(scoffs)

21:28.413 --> 21:29.789
Dick.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.959
I got her in my new movie.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.712
She gets eaten by a clown.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.797
Ooh...

21:37.881 --> 21:40.258
JACK:
Okay. Uh... (sighs deeply)

21:40.300 --> 21:41.926
Monday night--

21:41.968 --> 21:43.428
I like the Texans to win,
straight up.

21:43.470 --> 21:44.596
Money line.

21:44.679 --> 21:45.597
Same bet?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.849
Let's go 500, large.

21:49.893 --> 21:52.270
You do realize
they're a nine-point underdog?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.105
I know! I study, okay?!

21:54.147 --> 21:55.732
I know more than you!

21:56.524 --> 21:58.401
Okay, uh, just to be clear,

21:58.443 --> 21:59.778
straight up to win.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.613
You lose 500,

22:01.654 --> 22:03.406
plus 50 grand on the vig.

22:03.448 --> 22:04.699
Uh, no-no vig.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.868
-Wait, hold on...
-No vig!

22:11.539 --> 22:13.124
Are you okay with this?

22:14.125 --> 22:15.251
Y...
(coughs)

22:15.293 --> 22:16.252
Yeah.

22:16.294 --> 22:17.295
Yes.

22:17.379 --> 22:18.630
-(clears throat)
-Okay.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.256
-(coughs)
-A-And if-- and if you win

22:20.298 --> 22:21.966
the big dog...

22:23.134 --> 22:25.095
...we owe you, uh...

22:26.304 --> 22:28.390
...$1.4 million,

22:28.473 --> 22:29.641
give or take.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.309
I'm good for my end, baby.

22:31.393 --> 22:32.644
You good for yours?

22:35.021 --> 22:36.815
(quietly):
How's your sphincter?

22:37.607 --> 22:38.650
-JACK: Hey.
-Huh?

22:38.692 --> 22:39.818
You guys want some sneakers?

22:39.901 --> 22:40.902

22:40.985 --> 22:42.153
Hey, big boy.

22:42.987 --> 22:43.988
