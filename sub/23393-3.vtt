<i>♪ Ooh, ooh ♪</i>

00:50.216 --> 00:51.634
Hmm.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.387
That's another tough one.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.139
But if you had to say...

00:56.222 --> 00:59.809
Okay, if I had to say,
I guess I would say...

00:59.893 --> 01:04.689
Ed would play the pan flute
on a Tuesday in the Alps.

01:04.773 --> 01:08.109
But don't forget Ed's dead
and the Alps aren't real, so...

01:08.193 --> 01:10.779
May I ask where you're going
with these strange questions?

01:10.862 --> 01:13.782
No one knows how to get
Sheree's house back better than Sheree.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.908
That's me!

01:14.991 --> 01:17.160
-She just doesn't know she knows it.
-I don't!

01:17.243 --> 01:20.497
So we have to poke around
in Ed-and-Sheree-land until she does.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.248
Frankie, you're really good at this.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.377
I'm an amateur sleuth
with an unimpeachable track record.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.422
Solving the mystery
of who put Jolly Ranchers in the blender

01:29.506 --> 01:31.090
isn't much of a track record.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.343
Me, when I was high.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.969
It was a hard one to crack.

01:35.553 --> 01:39.140
-Oh, it's Jacob. I want to talk.

01:39.474 --> 01:43.228
Oh, but I need an hour
just to go through my squirrel story.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.813
Well, we can take a break.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.065
A break

01:47.148 --> 01:48.233
You.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.734
Constantly.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.319
That's my genius.

01:51.402 --> 01:54.781
I appear to be taking breaks,
but I am always working.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.158
In fact, I took a break
in the middle of that sentence

01:57.242 --> 01:58.409
and you didn't even know it.

01:58.493 --> 01:59.786
I didn't notice.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.371
Um... We have a problem.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.915
Yeah, we should be doing this naked
in a sweat lodge.

02:03.998 --> 02:06.376
No, somebody's putting Sheree's house
on the market.

02:06.459 --> 02:10.755
-Come here. Come. Look.
They can't do that yet!

02:11.506 --> 02:12.632
Look at this.

02:15.468 --> 02:19.556
Oh, those little shits!
Oh, it must have been Patricia.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.849
Arnold's too weak.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.685
How my sweet man could have
such hateful children?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.187
We gotta stop them. We gotta kill them.

02:26.271 --> 02:28.022
I know someone. It's me.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.733
I saw<i> The Accountant</i>
and it really resonated.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.735
I couldn't make heads or tails
of that movie.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.947
Ignore her. How did you know
Ed wanted you to have the house?

02:36.030 --> 02:38.199
He told me. He said it all the time.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.243
Yeah, but did anyone else hear him say it?

02:40.326 --> 02:43.246
And/or did you happen to record
any or all of your conversations?

02:43.329 --> 02:45.832
Okay, you need to go
take a run around the block.

02:45.915 --> 02:47.959
I mean, he put it in a love letter.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.880
He wrote it down?
In his own handwriting?

02:51.963 --> 02:55.633
I think so. He never told me
if he knew other handwritings.

02:55.717 --> 02:59.178
I mean, he did win all those
penmanship medals in third grade.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.765
Yes! Third grade.
Third. Third place. Bronze medal.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.101
-Test your mettle...
-She's stuck in a loop.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.230
A handwritten love letter could possibly
supersede the original will

03:09.314 --> 03:11.649
if the letter were signed and dated.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.652
Well, she thinks it's signed.
She's just not sure it's dated.

03:14.736 --> 03:17.405
And where is this maybe-signed,
possibly

03:17.488 --> 03:18.531
Somewhere in her house.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.117
Yeah, but her stepkids
changed all the locks

03:21.200 --> 03:23.202
and they filed a thing
so she can't get in.

03:23.286 --> 03:27.248
Well, then her lawyer needs to file
another thing to vacate the first thing.

03:27.332 --> 03:29.751
Which we can help with,
if you can wait a few days.

03:29.834 --> 03:33.880
I don't know if you've heard,
but I've been nominated for a Tappy Award

03:33.963 --> 03:36.966
for my performance in<i> 1776</i>
and tomorrow's...

03:37.050 --> 03:39.844
Does no one understand
"ticktock, ticktock"?

03:40.303 --> 03:45.808
On<i> The Doctor House</i> show, this is exactly
when he would break into a patient's house

03:45.892 --> 03:47.727
and get the letter himself.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.647
Okay, first of all,
the show is called<i> House,</i>

03:50.730 --> 03:53.566
and he mostly cures bizarre diseases
after making them worse.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.195
And last time I checked,
we are not breaking into any place.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.239
Well, check again, because we are.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.406
I just did.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.909
We're going to get these two
to help us do the legal stuff.

04:02.992 --> 04:05.203
I'm just afraid if we tip our hand,

04:05.286 --> 04:08.289
the stepkids might figure out
what we're trying to get.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.457
And destroy it.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.585
Oh, Grace. Oh my God, Sol's right.
We need to break in.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.922
I feel like that's a slight bastardization
of what I was trying say.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.382
We are not breaking into her house.

04:17.966 --> 04:20.760
Okay. I didn't want to tell you this,

04:20.843 --> 04:23.888
but we have to do something
while she can still enjoy it.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.849
Because I found some other papers
up in the studio.

04:26.933 --> 04:30.853
Sheree is dying
from Erdheim-Chester disease.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.815
She is not. You heard that on<i> House.</i>

04:34.274 --> 04:37.443
That may be, but Sheree is out of options.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.195
And frankly, so am I.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.655
I'm in limbo here.

04:40.738 --> 04:43.491
I need my home back. I need my studio.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.076
I need to paint.

04:45.159 --> 04:49.080
I tried painting at Starbucks
the other day and it was super weird.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.375
Actually, as still-licensed attorneys,

04:52.458 --> 04:57.005
neither Robert nor I can be party
to the planning of a crime.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.799
I think we've spent enough time
in jail already.

04:59.882 --> 05:02.010
I can't go back, man.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.512
Then we will retreat to Del Taco,

05:04.595 --> 05:06.764
where all my best shenanigans are plotted.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.474
<i>Vámonos,</i> Grace.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.186
I think we all knew this would end
with me back at Del Taco

05:12.312 --> 05:15.148
and that I'd be
breaking into Sheree's house.

05:15.231 --> 05:19.319
Should I be offended they didn't
congratulate me on my Tappy nod?

05:20.320 --> 05:21.821
They're not real theater people.

05:21.904 --> 05:26.075
Excuse me,
I was in<i> Mummenschanz</i> for three years.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.876
-Don't sit down!
!

05:34.959 --> 05:36.586
Barry, I told you.

05:36.669 --> 05:39.922
Spit uses those pillows
to create a safe space.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.591
Oh, my God. Come on.

05:41.674 --> 05:45.970
Look, until I start my new job,
this is my safe space too, so...

05:46.054 --> 05:49.057
I'm happy to keep paying the dog walker
if you can't juggle watching Spit

05:49.140 --> 05:52.185
with the high stakes world
of waiting for your job to begin.

05:52.560 --> 05:54.187
Okay, you know, I think I can handle it.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.565
Great. Can I just run you through
a few things real quick?

05:57.648 --> 05:58.858
By all means.

06:01.277 --> 06:04.364
So you may have noticed that Spit's bed
moves around during the day.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.782
I trip on it regularly, yes.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.159
So that's because Spit
likes to follow the sun.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.078
So, 2:00 is lunchtime.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.330
So just take 30 pieces of dry food...

06:13.289 --> 06:14.874
like that, but count them out.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.211
Just think of this room
as a giant sundial,

06:18.294 --> 06:20.838
and then move his bed
around it accordingly...

06:20.922 --> 06:22.381
And then moisten it with a mister.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.886
...making sure it's never in full light.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.596
Spit prefers half.

06:29.514 --> 06:33.684
And then hand-feed it to him, crouching
down very non-aggressively on the floor.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.771
How about I don't do that? And he's a dog.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.689
Save that attitude for Lauren.

06:38.773 --> 06:42.151
Oh, I have to show you where I keep
the Ugg boot he likes to hump.

06:42.902 --> 06:43.903
The what?

06:43.986 --> 06:45.696
We call her Candace.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.284
Oh. Damn it. Give me another one.

06:50.368 --> 06:54.288
You've broken two of mine.
Go break another one of your own.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.498
Fine.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.626
Who still uses Diners Club?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.754
"Steven Capono," that's who.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.214
I'm not gonna ask.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.924
Oh, don't.

07:07.718 --> 07:08.970
Shit.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.474
Oh, don't worry, I've done
this hanger thing a million times

07:13.558 --> 07:15.226
to get access to our garage.

07:15.309 --> 07:18.354
-Yeah, or you just leave it open.
-Well, that works, too.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.648
Hey, just give it to me.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.819
Good idea. You're taller. I'll keep watch.

07:24.902 --> 07:28.239
That squirrel.
That squirrel's got its eye on us.

07:28.322 --> 07:31.826
Which is the crux of the squirrel story
I have to tell Jacob.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.163
Nice try, CIA robot-squirrel.

07:35.705 --> 07:40.126
Ah! I did it! Here. I did it!
I did it! Oh, I'm a bad girl.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.503
Grace! Grace! Grace!

07:42.587 --> 07:43.463
Yes!

07:45.173 --> 07:46.382
We did it!

07:46.966 --> 07:49.135
Be cool. Be cool.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.344
Shh.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.316
Hi, Grace.
Tell Frankie her disguise worked.

08:03.399 --> 08:07.737
The mail lady... person, mailperson,
had no idea who I was.

08:07.820 --> 08:12.116
I will. But... we're in your garage
and we've hit a deadbolt.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.077
<i>Oh, God, why are doors so hard?</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:16.787
<i>But there's another way.</i>

08:16.871 --> 08:18.623
But, oh, you're not gonna like it.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.088
You can do this, Grace.

08:26.589 --> 08:29.133
You've been training for it
your whole life. Yeah, not since I started eating
cheddar biscuits.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.638
That's what the cloggasins are for.

08:33.721 --> 08:36.265
If you get stuck,
I can kick you on through.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.768
-That is not going to work for me.
-Oh, don't worry.

08:38.851 --> 08:42.688
The cloggasins have the heft of a clog,
but the softness of a moccasin.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.483
They're the one good thing
that came out of Santa Fe.

08:45.566 --> 08:48.027
Or are they, in fact, the worst thing?

08:48.110 --> 08:51.697
Oh, come on, Grace.
I'd try it, but my back...

08:52.698 --> 08:53.741
Don't kick me.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.826
Oh, Scout's honor.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.912
Okay, here we go.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.794
That's it! You're doing it!

09:06.254 --> 09:07.421
I'm stuck!

09:09.715 --> 09:11.592
I said not to do that!

09:11.676 --> 09:13.928
-But it's helping!
-No, it's not!

09:14.011 --> 09:15.263
But it's fun!

09:15.346 --> 09:17.890
-Get this side in. Yes!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.934
That's it! You did it! We're in!

09:20.017 --> 09:22.270
-Oh, God, my knee.
-Oh, no!

09:22.353 --> 09:25.982
Which knee? The arthritic knee
or the torn meniscus knee?

09:26.065 --> 09:30.611
The one that's still strong enough
to pin you down while I strangle you.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.617
"To be called a 'newcomer' at age 73
was sweet enough...

09:37.660 --> 09:39.495
but to actually win this?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.455
I have so many people to thank.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.709
First and foremost,
my wonderful husband, Sol,

09:44.792 --> 09:49.171
for loving me and talking me down
off every ledge in our house."

09:49.255 --> 09:50.464
Pause for laugh.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.382
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

09:51.465 --> 09:55.386
"To Peter, our director,
Kim, our saint of a choreographer,

09:55.469 --> 09:58.848
all the guys in the cast,
and our two dolls...

09:58.931 --> 10:02.101
Guess which show I want to do
after<i> The Music Man?"</i>

10:02.184 --> 10:03.144
Pause for laugh.

10:03.227 --> 10:04.270
Ha-ha-ha.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.772
<i>-Guys and Dolls.</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:09.400
Oh! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

10:09.483 --> 10:13.112
"To everyone at dressbarn
for sponsoring this fancy evening,

10:13.195 --> 10:16.532
I'm honored, I'm touched, I'm verklempt,

10:16.657 --> 10:20.494
all of which Sol will have to deal with
on the car ride home.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.997
Thank you, and God bless."

10:24.248 --> 10:27.627
-Always.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.255
What if this is
your Vanessa Redgrave moment?

10:31.339 --> 10:34.759
I like to think of every moment
as my Vanessa Redgrave moment.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.679
I meant at how she used her Oscar speech
as a political platform.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.349
Sol, this is a dressbarn platform.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.977
It's hardly the time or the place
for burning our bras.

10:45.061 --> 10:49.398
We need to take advantage of whatever
platform we find ourselves standing on.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.443
There are so many things
that need saying right now,

10:52.526 --> 10:54.570
and this is a chance to say it.

10:55.571 --> 10:56.989
Indoors.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.408
In our Sunday best.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.911
With no threat of police action.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.040
That may be more of a "you" thing
than a "me" thing.

11:06.749 --> 11:07.792
You mean...

11:09.794 --> 11:11.379
like ironing?

11:20.888 --> 11:22.098
What were you doing?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.934
-Nothing.
-Bitch, you were watching something.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.977
I am your boss.

11:27.561 --> 11:30.314
Sorry. Mrs. Bitch, what were you watching?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.399
Okay, fine. Ooh!

11:34.485 --> 11:36.153
Aw, it's the Spit-cam...

11:36.821 --> 11:38.864
now co-starring Barry.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.992
You're spying.
-No, I'm not spying.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.329
-Probably, deep down. Yeah.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.206
So, no.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.501
It's lunchtime and I need to make sure
that he feeds him correctly.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.212
Good boy, Barry.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.302
No, don't rub his face in it.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.097
This... is... riveting.

12:10.020 --> 12:13.441
He tried for, like, two seconds,
and then he just gave up.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.818
Yeah, like me and the<i> Big Brother</i> program.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
Agh, Diego.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.034
Yeah, I can see why everyone's
fighting over this place.

12:24.118 --> 12:26.871
We need to find this letter
and get out of here.

12:30.749 --> 12:33.169
I'll do Reiki on your knee
when we get home.

12:33.252 --> 12:34.545
Oh, that'll be great.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.964
-No!

12:37.047 --> 12:38.466
Now help me look!

12:40.759 --> 12:42.761
-Turn that off!
-It's Bud.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.055
They were finding out the sex of the baby.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.600
We have broken and entered.
This is no time--

12:47.683 --> 12:48.893
I'll be quick.

12:50.269 --> 12:51.854
Hey, hi, honey.

12:52.563 --> 12:54.815
Yes. Cut right to it.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.486
-It's a girl!
-That's great. Now hang up.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.906
Bud, congratulations.
I'll call you right back.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.574
Hi, Allison.

13:14.960 --> 13:18.088
Tomorrow's a full moon,
I'll come over and bring my crystals.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.507
Bye, Allison!

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
-Oh!

13:23.177 --> 13:25.721
Just because we are
in the middle of a heist

13:25.846 --> 13:28.807
doesn't mean that phone etiquette
flies out the GD window.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.976
Yeah, well, what about heist etiquette?

13:35.731 --> 13:39.235
Oh, you are gonna school me
on heist etiquette?

13:39.318 --> 13:40.152
Somebody there?

13:41.445 --> 13:42.780
Oh, shit.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.032
-Oh, God.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.411
Hello?

13:53.832 --> 13:54.959
Who the hell are you?

13:55.876 --> 13:56.710
Oh.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.588
-I'm gonna call the cops.
-No, no. I'm gonna level with you.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.132
My name is Jennifer Nightingale.

14:02.216 --> 14:05.886
I'm a harpist-slash-tax accountant
from out of state

14:05.970 --> 14:08.597
and I don't know how I got here.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.059
-And I'm Carol Carruthers

14:12.142 --> 14:14.061
of Carol Carruthers Realty.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.313
And you must be... Arnold?

14:16.689 --> 14:17.523
Yeah...

14:17.606 --> 14:20.860
Your sister, Patricia, has been in touch.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.362
I didn't know that she'd already
reached out to realtors.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.990
Oh, she has.
So I brought my best customer.

14:26.073 --> 14:29.076
-Jennifer Nightinhorse. Nightingale.
-Jennifer Nightingale

14:29.159 --> 14:32.037
is thinking about moving here
from Santa Fe.

14:32.746 --> 14:35.541
-I always wanted to go there.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.213
Do you enjoy finding snakes
in your purse and in your hair,

14:41.297 --> 14:43.465
and not in the empowering Medusa way?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.467
Jenn is looking to make some changes.

14:45.551 --> 14:48.137
She also...
she needs a lot of closet space,

14:48.220 --> 14:53.017
so we'd like to investigate every one
in the house. Every single one. Okay?

14:53.100 --> 14:55.144
I have a lot of jackets.

14:55.227 --> 14:56.687
What about the brown heat?

14:56.770 --> 14:58.522
Well, the jackets are solar.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.318
-Oh. Okay. Uh, follow me.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.613
I think I love Carol Carruthers.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.907
Well, she is on the fence about you.

15:10.576 --> 15:15.414
And finally, I have to thank my amazing
assistant director, Suzanne Wu,

15:15.497 --> 15:20.461
for always being there with great advice
and a full glass of chardonnay.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.881
Thank you! Thank you!

15:24.465 --> 15:27.301
It's official: I hate the Tappy Awards.

15:27.384 --> 15:30.012
-And I've met Suzanne Wu. She's a jackass.
-Shh.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.348
Congratulations.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.432
Thank you.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.395
Well, next year, when you win
for<i> The Music Man,</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:43.317
you could be up there thanking me and Sol,
if you agree to let him be my assistant.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.194
Why would I agree to that?

15:46.362 --> 15:48.364
-Sorry, Sol. I tried.
-It's okay.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.574
I just wish that man's very long speech

15:50.658 --> 15:53.285
had been more
than an endless list of thank yous.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.663
On my way out,
I'm going to punch him in the neck.

15:55.746 --> 15:59.166
The nominees for Best Newcomer
in a Play or Musical are...

15:59.249 --> 16:00.459
Oh! Here we go!

16:00.542 --> 16:02.503
Paul Brunetto for<i> Grease.</i>

16:05.506 --> 16:08.133
Robert Hanson for<i> 1776.</i>

16:08.217 --> 16:09.677
Yay!
-Shh.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.637
Stop! I'm not winning.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.138
Maddie Rogers for<i> Annie.</i>

16:14.139 --> 16:15.391
She's gonna win.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.268
She's already won Best Actress,

16:18.352 --> 16:22.064
Best Female Dancer: Tap,
and Best Female Dancer: Jazz.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.650
Divonni Sella for<i> Tick, Tick... Boom!.</i>

16:26.068 --> 16:27.861
And the winner is...

16:31.991 --> 16:35.035
-Robert Hanson for<i> 1776!</i>
-Oh, my God, I won!

16:35.119 --> 16:36.286
You won!

16:36.745 --> 16:37.579
Ah!

16:40.708 --> 16:42.376
Get up there, "Newcomer"!

16:43.669 --> 16:46.005
Oh, I'll need these. Oh, my gosh.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.301
Mwah!

16:51.385 --> 16:53.554
Oh! Oh!

16:53.637 --> 16:54.471
Wow!

16:56.181 --> 16:58.517
Oh, thank...

16:59.893 --> 17:01.437
I mean, wow!

17:03.439 --> 17:07.067
To be called a "newcomer" at age 73
was sweet enough,

17:07.151 --> 17:09.236
but to actually win this...

17:10.195 --> 17:12.364
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:20.581 --> 17:24.293
You know, it was an honor to play...

17:25.461 --> 17:27.838
John Adams, a man who stood up...

17:30.090 --> 17:33.969
...to things that were bigger
and scarier and more powerful than he was.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.973
And, you know,
we had a little taste of that

17:38.098 --> 17:40.768
during our run of<i> 1776.</i>

17:42.102 --> 17:45.939
We had to stand up to bullies
who were threatening to shut us down

17:46.065 --> 17:49.026
because we are a gay theater group.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.487
But we did stand up.

17:51.570 --> 17:57.701
Because the show
of eradicating intolerance must go on.

17:58.827 --> 18:05.375
And for that, I have to thank
my director, Peter Higgins...

18:06.502 --> 18:11.548
and my beautiful, wonderful,
supportive cast:

18:12.299 --> 18:16.303
Paul, Charlie, Wenda, Michael, even Steve.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.515
I thank all those brave souls,

18:19.598 --> 18:21.600
my brothers and sisters in battle.

18:21.683 --> 18:23.852
Must be saving the best for last.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.814
And I thank the one man

18:26.897 --> 18:29.608
who truly made all this possible...

18:33.237 --> 18:34.321
John Adams.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.660
I zoned out. Did he thank you?

18:43.372 --> 18:44.665
-Hey!

18:45.666 --> 18:47.251
Hi, little man.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.168
Oh.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.753
-Hey.
-Hi, big man.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.673
-You're home early.
-Not really.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.259
So, you guys have a good day?
How was Spit

18:55.342 --> 18:57.052
Yeah. Every last bite.

18:57.636 --> 18:58.762
That's good.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.940
Okay, here you go.

19:10.899 --> 19:13.026
-Smells good.
-Yeah.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.028
So what are you doing?

19:15.154 --> 19:18.949
I just want to make sure I threw
all that yogurt out. I hate yogurt.

19:19.032 --> 19:22.244
-I don't know why I keep buying it.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.704
And I buy it?

19:23.787 --> 19:26.456
So... did you do the hand thing?

19:27.040 --> 19:27.875
What?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.209
When you fed Spit.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.753
Oh. Yeah.

19:31.837 --> 19:32.754
And it worked?

19:33.505 --> 19:35.424
-Yeah, he ate.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.178
-No, I was just asking about your day.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.554
Oh.

19:40.637 --> 19:42.389
Well, my mom called--

19:42.472 --> 19:43.682
With Spit.

19:45.642 --> 19:47.060
She got her birthday card.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.524
Wow, when you look in a closet,
you really get in there.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.569
It's hereditary.
Both my parents were gynecologists.

19:55.652 --> 19:57.988
-Oh.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.282
Oh, well that's sort of a catch-all room.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.038
Oh, Arnold, isn't this the perfect time

20:06.121 --> 20:09.458
to tell you all about
the magical world of tax accounting?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.419
-Well--
-Not much is known about tax accounting.

20:12.794 --> 20:17.049
Of course, the ancients tell us
that it all began with Pythagoras,

20:17.132 --> 20:18.717
a known philanderer,

20:18.800 --> 20:20.928
but that's a story for another time.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.221
And that time is now.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.389
-Pythagoras--
We're clean.

20:25.015 --> 20:28.852
Would you stop talking my ear off
and let's see the rest of the house.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.688
Okay. Well, there are some closets
in the kitchen. Did you see those?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.148
No, but we're about to.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.651
And if there are some crackers
and some soft cheese spread,

20:35.734 --> 20:37.027
we'll see that, too.

20:44.409 --> 20:47.913
Ugh.
Really slaps you in the rods and cones.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.415
-I found it!

20:50.499 --> 20:52.000
Where was it?

20:52.084 --> 20:55.879
Oh! It was in Ed's humidor
where he hid his candy.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.173
Oh, my God! What kind of candy?

20:58.257 --> 21:01.510
-Signed and dated.

21:04.388 --> 21:06.848
The question is what are you doing here?

21:06.932 --> 21:12.145
I have a letter from my husband saying
that he wanted me to have this house.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.815
Our house. Our home.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.276
But you knew that already, Arnold,
didn't you?

21:17.359 --> 21:19.569
-Answer the woman, Arnold.
-Look.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.197
-You know what, I don't know what she--
-What I don't know

21:22.281 --> 21:25.617
is how you and your sister
could treat me like this.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.703
I tried with you.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.580
I invited you to every holiday.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.584
Every Christmas, I stuffed stockings
for you and your kids

21:34.668 --> 21:36.712
and you never came once.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.133
Which was a crappy thing to do
to your father.

21:41.216 --> 21:42.634
And our friend.

21:43.051 --> 21:44.636
Look, Jennifer,

21:44.720 --> 21:46.972
-I don't know what this woman has--
-Get out.

21:47.055 --> 21:49.808
-Get out of her house.

21:57.649 --> 21:59.651
-He left.
-Damn straight he left!

21:59.735 --> 22:01.653
And he better not come back.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.656
I know all kinds of jujitsu I made up.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.283
I can't believe it.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.577
-Thank you both.
-You're welcome.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.828
Aah!

22:12.164 --> 22:14.082
I meant to thank you!

22:14.166 --> 22:16.668
No, no, I understand.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.088
If you had more time,

22:20.172 --> 22:21.882
you would have gotten to me

22:21.965 --> 22:25.802
and the rest
of your second-tier thank yous.

22:25.886 --> 22:29.848
You had to get Steve in there,
right up there at the top.

22:29.931 --> 22:33.560
Steve, who you once called
"Theatrical ISIS."

22:33.643 --> 22:37.105
But you heard my original speech.
I thanked you first!

22:37.522 --> 22:41.151
-If you hadn't made me change it--

22:41.234 --> 22:43.945
Well, if you hadn't filled my head
with all that political stuff.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.363
Don't put this on me.

22:45.447 --> 22:49.659
Just because I wanted your award
to mean something.

22:49.743 --> 22:51.620
Oh, there it is.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.456
-No, no, I don't mean--
-Yes, you did.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.875
Everything about you these days
is about saving the world

22:56.958 --> 22:58.794
and all else pales in comparison.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.005
Yes, I'm a terrible person
for wanting to heal the world.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.801
No, but you think that everything you do
is more important than what I do,

23:05.884 --> 23:08.887
when what I do means as much to me
as what you do means to you.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.472
And I respect that.

23:11.515 --> 23:13.141
-But I just think...

23:13.225 --> 23:15.852
-...that what I do...
-Tread lightly.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.562
-...is more...

23:18.105 --> 23:20.232
It's apples and oranges, Robert! And which do you like more, Sol?

23:22.526 --> 23:24.653
You didn't thank me!

23:24.736 --> 23:26.446
And I'm very sorry.

23:26.530 --> 23:30.909
And I've apologized numerous times,
and I would change it if I could.

23:31.785 --> 23:36.832
And I'm sorry I implied
that your thing isn't meaningful.

23:37.749 --> 23:38.834
Thank you.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.252
Oh, sure.

23:40.877 --> 23:42.170
That you thank me for.

23:47.717 --> 23:51.555
"I learned a lot from<i> 1776</i>
about the great men of the past.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.557
But I learn even more every day

23:53.640 --> 23:56.560
from the greatest man
in my present and future,

23:56.643 --> 23:58.478
Sol Bergstein."

24:00.438 --> 24:01.690
When did you add that?

24:02.107 --> 24:05.318
While you were ripping me a new one
in the car ride home.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.237
Pause for laugh.

24:18.790 --> 24:19.916
What are you doing with that?

24:25.964 --> 24:28.175
I just hope I didn't peak too soon.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.431
He's not even trying the hand thing.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.391
Ugh, that's why I broke up
with my last boyfriend.

24:36.516 --> 24:40.020
Gonna have to say something to him.
I mean, before Spit starves to death.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.189
Uh... No, you aren't. Look.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.233
He's eating.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.776
How did he get him--

24:46.860 --> 24:48.528
-Shit! Uh-uh.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.822
-Nope. Nope, nope, nope.
-Barry found the cameras.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.116
-Destroy the computer. Meet me in Mexico.
-Okay.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.213
Hey.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.339
Hey.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.468
So, there are cameras around
so I can watch Spit.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.386
Yeah, I noticed.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.767
So, how did you get him
to eat from his bowl?

25:18.850 --> 25:22.270
Well, I put food in it
because he continues to be a dog.

25:23.813 --> 25:25.232
Look at you...

25:26.066 --> 25:28.443
-knowing what's a dog.
-Okay, you know what...

25:28.944 --> 25:32.614
What the fuck is going on?
You follow me to Baltimore, you stalk me.

25:32.697 --> 25:35.283
Right? Then I come back.
But now I feel like you're testing me.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.744
First with Lauren, and now with Spit.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.038
-I'm not testing you.

25:40.121 --> 25:42.999
I don't know what I'm doing!
Isn't that obvious?

25:43.083 --> 25:45.252
How long are you going to use that
as an excuse?

25:45.335 --> 25:48.129
At what point do you start acting
like a normal person and say,

25:48.213 --> 25:49.589
"I'm in a relationship now"?

25:49.673 --> 25:52.801
But whenever I get to
"I'm in a relationship now," I fuck it up.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.512
Except with Spit, and that's probably
because he can't leave me. -I'm not leaving you either.
-We don't know that, Barry.

25:58.306 --> 26:00.350
-You can open doors.
-Yes, but...

26:01.476 --> 26:03.311
I will always come back to you.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.484
You're a good boy, Barry.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.527
Thank you.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.159
One sec.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.127
Damn it.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.088
<i>Now if I, as just plain John Doe,</i>

26:30.171 --> 26:33.508
<i>an ordinary citizen, were to see you</i>
<i>making a U-turn, I'd have to...</i>

26:33.591 --> 26:37.220
Hey, Jennifer Nightingale,
I can hear Don Knotts in my bedroom.

26:37.804 --> 26:39.848
You can? I can't.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.894
Well, your ears are just ornamental
at this point, aren't they?

26:44.978 --> 26:46.688
How's that knee, lady?

26:46.771 --> 26:47.772
Oh, it's better.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.983
Just stabbing pains now.

26:51.276 --> 26:52.444
But it was worth it.

26:52.527 --> 26:54.321
-Yeah, it was.
-Yeah.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.532
I couldn't have done it without you.

26:57.991 --> 27:01.036
Impersonating a tax accountant
and her realtor?

27:01.328 --> 27:03.997
I like to think
you wouldn't do it without me.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.166
-Well, I wouldn't.

27:08.793 --> 27:11.671
Do you have a secret stash
of love letters?

27:11.755 --> 27:14.382
Robert used to write
very thorough grocery lists.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.842
-Ah.

27:15.925 --> 27:18.887
Oh, yeah. I've got a whole box of letters.

27:19.637 --> 27:20.805
From Bud and Coyote

27:20.889 --> 27:24.934
when they went to
the Angela Davis Camp for Feminist Boys.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.608
It must be nice for Sheree
to have been loved like that.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.734
Yeah.

27:32.817 --> 27:33.943
Hmm.

27:34.986 --> 27:39.240
Speaking of, did you fill Jacob in
on your squirrel theory?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.659
No, I missed our Skype-Face.

27:42.285 --> 27:45.747
And that means the squirrels win
and I'm never getting to sleep.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.956
-I told you.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.001
He reads to me every night.
That's how I fall asleep.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.796
Sometimes we diddle first.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.757
If I'm being honest,
that's how I fall asleep.

27:56.341 --> 27:59.302
Well...
I'm afraid I can't help you with that.

27:59.844 --> 28:01.846
Can't or won't, Grace?

28:05.350 --> 28:07.185
But I'll tell you what I can do.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.150
"Online services
such as QuickBooks and ZipBooks

28:14.234 --> 28:18.279
can actually take care of all
your small business's bookkeeping needs.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.032
They can generate profit and loss reports,

28:21.116 --> 28:23.201
run balance sheets,

28:23.284 --> 28:26.454
even calculate and distribute
your monthly payroll.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.207
There's a difference
between bookkeeping..."
