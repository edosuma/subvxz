WEBVTT

00:17.430 --> 00:19.515
I've never seen so much nothing.

00:19.682 --> 00:21.934
I've never walked so far to see it.

00:22.101 --> 00:25.980
How was I to know the only structures
would be around the Stargate?

00:26.147 --> 00:28.941
There's the gate. Dial it up.

00:29.108 --> 00:32.903
The energy readings here
are the same as they were a mile away.

00:33.070 --> 00:35.156
I think we should stay for a while.

00:35.322 --> 00:39.577
- I thought you hated these suits.
- I do, but the readings are amazing.

00:39.744 --> 00:41.203
It's all around us.

00:41.370 --> 00:43.914
- Yet you cannot explain it.
- Not yet.

00:44.081 --> 00:47.460
- You can't figure out a way we can use it?
- Not yet.

00:49.462 --> 00:51.338
Let's call it a mission.

00:51.505 --> 00:55.634
There's such a thing as pure science.
Not everything has to be useful.

00:57.011 --> 01:02.933
You said the energy readings indicated
the presence of a civilisation.

01:03.100 --> 01:07.646
There are no buildings,
no people, no nothing. Just fog.

01:07.813 --> 01:11.901
It's not technically fog. There's
no water vapour in the atmosphere.

01:12.068 --> 01:15.738
And I don't think we need to wear
the Hazmat gear.

01:21.827 --> 01:24.372
Now you tell me.

01:24.538 --> 01:27.541
Dial the gate.

01:48.813 --> 01:51.941
<i>- (Sheppard) Let's move out.
- (McKay) Wait. Hold on.</i>

01:52.983 --> 01:57.238
- You wanted useful?
- What are you talking about?

01:57.405 --> 02:00.616
When the wormhole connected
there was a wild fluctuation.

02:00.783 --> 02:05.162
It looks like the gate is actually
drawing power from the atmosphere.

02:05.329 --> 02:09.500
- So?
- So this field goes on for miles.

02:09.667 --> 02:12.294
It may envelop the planet.
It's a lot of energy.

02:12.461 --> 02:15.423
- How much is a lot?
- In terms of joules or ergs?

02:15.589 --> 02:20.219
- In terms of lots.
- Well, lots and lots.

02:20.386 --> 02:23.097
Enough to open a wormhole
back to Earth.

03:31.082 --> 03:33.793
I thought only the Atlantis gate
could dial Earth.

03:33.959 --> 03:38.130
Yes. It has an additional control crystal
allowing an eighth chevron to lock.

03:38.297 --> 03:41.050
- Probably a security measure.
- It doesn't matter.

03:41.217 --> 03:44.011
With the crystal,
I can make the other gate work.

03:44.178 --> 03:49.892
You're suggesting we remove it
from our DHD and bring it to M5S-224?

03:50.059 --> 03:51.769
- Yes.
- Isn't that risky?

03:51.936 --> 03:55.648
- I'll be fine.
- She means in terms of breaking our gate.

03:55.815 --> 03:59.151
The control crystal is useless
without enough power.

03:59.318 --> 04:02.029
You said you didn't know
where the energy comes from.

04:02.196 --> 04:04.990
I believe it is being generated
in the atmosphere.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.368
- The fog?
- Yes.

04:07.535 --> 04:10.121
- You said it wasn't fog.
- Whatever it is.

04:10.287 --> 04:12.039
- How do you know?
- I don't.

04:12.206 --> 04:16.961
But the fog is the only thing around
and the energy readings were constant.

04:17.128 --> 04:20.548
OK, even if you can pull this off,

04:20.714 --> 04:23.801
we have to assume the Earth gate
lacks a power source

04:23.968 --> 04:26.512
capable of establishing
a wormhole to Pegasus.

04:26.679 --> 04:30.850
Whoever went would be taking the risk
of it being a one-way trip.

04:31.016 --> 04:33.477
- Someone will volunteer.
- You?

04:33.644 --> 04:37.773
I would only go if I knew there was
a good chance I could come back.

04:37.940 --> 04:41.569
We can send a message
to Stargate Command that we're OK.

04:42.611 --> 04:44.697
We've gathered a lot of intel.

04:44.864 --> 04:47.324
We should send it.

04:47.491 --> 04:51.245
If we can. Even if it's over a radio.

04:57.251 --> 04:59.336
All right. That's it.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.883
How easy is it to put that
in the other DHD?

05:04.050 --> 05:07.678
The Atlantis's DHD is unique.
There isn't an empty slot waiting.

05:07.845 --> 05:11.807
- Meaning?
- It may require some disassembly.

05:12.975 --> 05:16.270
- You wanna take the DHD apart?
- I'll put it back together.

05:16.437 --> 05:18.856
Don't you risk
disabling the other Stargate?

05:19.023 --> 05:22.651
Only if I screw up,
which is extremely unlikely.

05:22.818 --> 05:25.237
- 840 years.
- What?

05:25.404 --> 05:28.741
How long it will take us
to come get you by puddle jumper.

05:28.908 --> 05:32.036
But you would do that, right?

05:32.203 --> 05:34.288
- Of course.
- It won't be necessary.

05:34.455 --> 05:37.333
- However, I may require some assistance.
- Major?

05:37.500 --> 05:41.379
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

05:59.021 --> 06:01.941
<i>- Atlantis, this is McKay.
- (Weir) Go ahead.</i>

06:02.108 --> 06:05.778
- We're ready to begin work on the DHD.
- You're sure about this?

06:05.945 --> 06:08.406
Positive. We'll deliver good news.

06:08.572 --> 06:11.784
<i>- Good luck.
- Back in time for supper.</i>

06:13.244 --> 06:15.329
Right.

06:17.039 --> 06:19.125
Let's get started.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.628
<i>- (knocking)
- Come in.</i>

06:25.631 --> 06:28.217
Hi. Do you have a moment?

06:28.384 --> 06:30.469
Yeah, sure.

06:31.679 --> 06:37.393
<i>War And Peace.
That's some heavy reading.</i>

06:37.560 --> 06:40.771
Back on Earth
when I was getting ready for this mission,

06:40.938 --> 06:43.441
I realised I might be here for a while,

06:43.607 --> 06:48.821
so I figured, "Why not bring along a book
that takes a while to read?"

06:48.988 --> 06:51.574
- Page 17?
- I'm right on schedule.

06:52.491 --> 06:56.579
Hm. It's kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:56.746 --> 06:59.457
Home. Going home.

06:59.623 --> 07:03.085
- Oh.
- McKay's right.

07:03.252 --> 07:07.089
If this works and we establish
a wormhole back to Earth...

07:07.256 --> 07:11.427
If this conversation is going where I think,
you can put your mind at rest.

07:11.594 --> 07:14.805
I'm not going anywhere.
I haven't read my book.

07:14.972 --> 07:16.891
<i>(laughs)</i>

07:17.058 --> 07:23.189
Look, all I'm saying is that
you are the person who is best qualified

07:23.355 --> 07:27.109
to brief General Hammond and the others
about the Wraith threat.

07:27.276 --> 07:31.155
Well, maybe so,
but I think I'm needed here.

07:32.573 --> 07:35.201
- Good.
- But if you wanna go, I understand.

07:35.368 --> 07:38.871
- Are you saying I'm not needed here?
- I said I'd understand.

07:39.038 --> 07:41.999
Well, thank you, but I made a commitment.

07:42.166 --> 07:46.504
Of course, in all fairness, life-sucking
aliens weren't part of the brochure.

07:48.255 --> 07:52.593
- Regardless, I'm staying.
- Good.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.763
Wouldn't be the same without you.

08:03.562 --> 08:07.233
- Would you want to go back?
- It doesn't matter what I want.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.736
- Why not?
- Atlantis can't afford to lose me.

08:10.903 --> 08:17.159
I'm their expert in gate theory, wormhole
physics and a myriad of other sciences.

08:17.326 --> 08:20.705
I'd love to see my grandma.
She thinks I'm in Afghanistan.

08:20.871 --> 08:23.666
Whoever goes should command
the respect of the SGC,

08:23.833 --> 08:27.044
have the patience and knowledge
to bring them up to speed

08:27.211 --> 08:29.463
and find a way to bring the cavalry back.

08:29.630 --> 08:32.466
You're saying
you're invaluable everywhere.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.719
It would create a void if I went,

08:34.885 --> 08:38.472
but you'll know that
I'll be spearheading the effort to return

08:38.639 --> 08:41.933
with reinforcements, fresh supplies
and Big Macs for all.

08:42.101 --> 08:44.854
- I feel better already.
- Yeah. Good.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.189
Good.

08:50.401 --> 08:53.988
Major Sheppard,
have we heard back from Dr McKay?

08:54.155 --> 08:57.700
- Not yet.
- Word of the discovery has spread.

08:57.867 --> 09:00.786
- I've noticed.
- It is to be expected,

09:00.953 --> 09:05.499
faced with the prospect of being reunited
with loved ones, returning home.

09:05.666 --> 09:08.377
Yeah, I'd love to go back.

09:08.544 --> 09:11.422
You would consider leaving Atlantis?

09:11.589 --> 09:14.759
If I knew I could gate back here,
I'd go in a heartbeat.

09:14.925 --> 09:18.888
- It would be good to see your world.
- You could help with the briefing.

09:20.181 --> 09:24.477
- I would like that.
- You know about the Pegasus galaxy.

09:24.643 --> 09:28.105
Then there's those cool Earth things -
football, Ferris wheels.

09:28.272 --> 09:32.443
Oh. Do you remember
the last of the popcorn we ate?

09:33.778 --> 09:38.366
- We could get more.
- If we knew we could return.

09:38.532 --> 09:40.743
<i>(man) Unscheduled activation.</i>

09:44.080 --> 09:47.083
It's a radio transmission
from Dr McKay.

09:47.249 --> 09:50.336
<i>- Rodney?
- Elizabeth. I'm done.</i>

09:50.503 --> 09:53.923
<i>- The component's installed in the DHD...
- Well done.</i>

09:54.090 --> 09:57.259
<i>- What about the energy readings?
- Same as before.</i>

09:57.426 --> 10:02.014
<i>The gate's drawing power
from the atmosphere.</i>

10:02.181 --> 10:05.935
<i>- OK, you stay put. We're on our way.
- Right.</i>

10:10.523 --> 10:12.650
So, are we ready?

10:12.817 --> 10:15.069
What's there to be ready for?

10:15.236 --> 10:19.073
It's a big moment and we haven't
been in contact for some time...

10:19.240 --> 10:21.659
- Hooray.
- Go ahead.

10:21.826 --> 10:23.911
<i>(Stargate dialling)</i>

10:30.209 --> 10:32.503
Please work.

10:39.802 --> 10:44.390
Stargate Command, this is Dr Elizabeth
Weir of the Atlantis expedition.

10:44.557 --> 10:47.476
Do you read?

10:49.979 --> 10:53.566
I repeat, this is Dr Weir. Come in, please.

10:54.483 --> 10:57.153
<i>This is Sergeant Harriman
of Stargate Command.</i>

10:57.319 --> 10:59.905
<i>Whoever you are,
this better not be a joke.</i>

11:00.072 --> 11:05.369
No joke, Sergeant. I'm sending
my personal IDC for confirmation.

11:07.121 --> 11:10.458
<i>Sorry. We're just a little surprised
to be hearing from you.</i>

11:10.624 --> 11:14.170
<i>- Understandable.
- The iris is open. Clear to come through.</i>

11:14.336 --> 11:18.132
Thanks, but we're not ready
to risk a one-way trip.

11:19.759 --> 11:22.428
<i>Doctor, things have changed
around here.</i>

11:22.595 --> 11:28.017
<i>The Asgard are fitting Prometheus with
engines that can reach other galaxies.</i>

11:28.184 --> 11:31.562
<i>We were manning a mission
to find out what happened to you.</i>

11:31.729 --> 11:33.981
Is he serious?

11:34.148 --> 11:37.068
<i>- Are you serious?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

11:37.234 --> 11:41.364
Come through now and you could be
back in Pegasus inside of a month.

11:46.035 --> 11:49.830
Well... who's going?

11:57.630 --> 12:00.091
Welcome back to Earth.

12:11.769 --> 12:14.730
While the Pegasus galaxy
does hold many dangers,

12:14.897 --> 12:17.942
I feel its potential rewards
justify the risk

12:18.109 --> 12:21.195
of maintaining a continued presence
on the Atlantis base.

12:21.362 --> 12:26.367
Your preliminary report has given
the Pentagon cause for concern.

12:26.534 --> 12:29.453
If the Wraith are as powerful as you say,

12:29.620 --> 12:33.082
they are an enemy
even more dangerous than the Goa'uld.

12:33.249 --> 12:39.714
Some say it would be prudent to cut our
losses and abandon the Pegasus galaxy.

12:39.880 --> 12:43.467
- You can't...
- This is a race that defeated the Ancients.

12:44.719 --> 12:49.515
Over the years, Stargate Command
has encountered a number of threats

12:49.682 --> 12:52.268
that could well have destroyed
this world.

12:52.435 --> 12:56.814
That never stopped you from continuing
to send teams through the gate.

12:56.981 --> 13:02.820
By the time SG-1 had returned from their
first mission, the damage had been done.

13:02.987 --> 13:07.700
We'd already alerted the Goa'uld
to our presence.

13:07.867 --> 13:11.245
In the case of the Wraith, however,
we have a choice.

13:11.412 --> 13:14.415
So we're just going to turn tail and run?

13:14.582 --> 13:18.252
The Pentagon would prefer to call it
a strategic withdrawal.

13:18.419 --> 13:21.505
How can we be sure
they won't come after us?

13:21.672 --> 13:25.593
They feed on human life forms.
They know there's a smorgasbord here.

13:26.886 --> 13:28.971
I don't think we have a choice.

13:29.138 --> 13:34.351
We need to explore the opportunities for
technological advancement in Pegasus.

13:34.518 --> 13:38.481
Not to mention our responsibility
to the other humans who live there.

13:39.690 --> 13:43.069
- Responsibility?
- We did wake up the Wraith.

13:43.235 --> 13:46.906
While that would have happened
eventually without our interference,

13:47.073 --> 13:51.994
our access to Ancient technology puts us
in a unique position to help those people.

13:52.161 --> 13:55.331
We can't just walk away.

13:59.877 --> 14:04.215
Rest assured your recommendation
will be considered at the highest level.

14:12.014 --> 14:14.183
General, sir.

14:15.309 --> 14:17.395
Thank you, sir.

14:17.561 --> 14:19.772
Major Sheppard.

14:22.942 --> 14:25.277
I'm surprised the briefing went so quickly.

14:25.444 --> 14:28.698
- You were very thorough, Major.
- Thank you, sir.

14:28.864 --> 14:31.867
I thought you'd be enjoying
some well-deserved R & R.

14:32.034 --> 14:34.954
I was going to arrange
some transportation.

14:35.121 --> 14:37.331
Consider it done. Anywhere you like.

14:37.498 --> 14:40.000
That's very generous.

14:40.167 --> 14:43.212
You've done your country a great service.
You deserve it.

14:45.339 --> 14:47.758
Thank you, sir.

15:00.438 --> 15:02.606
Well, how's our patient doing?

15:02.773 --> 15:05.651
We're all done, Major. She's free to go.

15:07.111 --> 15:09.196
I was afraid you had abandoned me.

15:09.363 --> 15:11.866
Just setting up our ride.

15:13.617 --> 15:16.037
So, where are we going?

15:16.203 --> 15:21.042
We should start
by getting you a new outfit.

15:56.786 --> 15:59.038
Hello, Simon.

15:59.205 --> 16:03.084
My God. When did you...

16:14.178 --> 16:16.514
I missed you.

16:30.903 --> 16:32.571
<i>(beeping)</i>

16:32.738 --> 16:35.616
<i>(woman's voice)
You have no new messages.</i>

16:35.783 --> 16:39.203
Huh. Must have been
a power failure or something.

16:39.370 --> 16:41.455
Anyways...

16:48.629 --> 16:51.549
<i>(man) There is nothing wrong
with your television set.</i>

16:51.716 --> 16:56.512
<i>Do not attempt to adjust the picture.
We are controlling the transmission.</i>

16:56.679 --> 17:03.894
<i>- (knocking)
- We will bring up the volume or whisper.</i>

17:05.604 --> 17:08.858
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:12.569 --> 17:15.448
- Thank you, Major.
- You're welcome.

17:15.614 --> 17:18.826
I have traded in many market-places
on many worlds...

17:18.992 --> 17:23.664
- Countries. Countries.
- Yes, of course. Countries.

17:23.830 --> 17:28.127
But here there are so many
different items to choose from.

17:28.294 --> 17:33.049
You seemed like you were having fun.
Hours and hours of fun.

17:34.050 --> 17:36.302
But you have picked out a nice outfit.

17:36.469 --> 17:38.554
Thank you.

17:39.930 --> 17:43.684
I wonder... if we had never
suffered the Wraith,

17:43.851 --> 17:48.481
would my people have created
a civilisation such as this?

17:48.647 --> 17:51.984
I'm starting to wonder
about a few things myself.

17:52.943 --> 17:55.488
- What?
- Nothing feels wrong to you?

17:55.654 --> 18:00.618
I don't mean one thing,
I mean... everything.

18:00.785 --> 18:03.371
I do not understand.

18:03.537 --> 18:08.376
Excuse me, could you take us
to the Green Moss Park area?

18:08.542 --> 18:11.253
<i>- (driver) Sure thing.
- Thank you.</i>

18:12.463 --> 18:17.468
I think I'll have a better idea
of what's bothering me once we get there.

18:18.803 --> 18:20.679
<i>(dog barking)</i>

18:20.846 --> 18:25.101
Hey, Sedge! Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

18:25.267 --> 18:27.770
More than you can imagine.

18:36.237 --> 18:41.033
I don't know how many times
I watched that damn tape you left me.

18:42.410 --> 18:46.330
- I wanted to tell you in person.
- No, you didn't.

18:46.497 --> 18:50.668
- You were afraid I'd talk you out of it.
- I was afraid you'd try.

18:50.835 --> 18:55.548
When you said you couldn't say where
you were going, my first guess was Korea.

18:55.715 --> 18:57.967
My second guess was Israel.

18:59.343 --> 19:03.013
To be honest,
the Pegasus galaxy didn't make my list.

19:04.598 --> 19:06.851
I am sorry.

19:08.185 --> 19:09.854
I know.

19:13.232 --> 19:17.153
I imagine my security clearance
doesn't let you tell me what you did.

19:20.364 --> 19:23.117
- No.
- Or when you'll be leaving again?

19:23.284 --> 19:25.077
No.

19:26.579 --> 19:31.709
At the very least
you could promise me that...

19:32.877 --> 19:36.088
...you'll take this with you.

19:36.255 --> 19:38.340
Simon.

19:42.970 --> 19:45.056
It's beautiful.

19:53.606 --> 19:55.691
Looks nice.

19:55.858 --> 19:57.985
Thank you.

20:10.289 --> 20:12.792
Is something wrong?

20:14.752 --> 20:17.713
No, I'm sorry. Just when you kissed me...

20:19.215 --> 20:21.884
What are you talking about, Elizabeth?

20:22.051 --> 20:24.720
<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

20:26.555 --> 20:28.641
Hello.

20:28.808 --> 20:31.060
General. What...

20:34.688 --> 20:38.359
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

20:56.001 --> 20:58.754
<i>(knocking)</i>

21:00.548 --> 21:03.092
Hang on.

21:11.142 --> 21:16.731
Oh, hey. I was in the middle of a
power nap and I'm not wearing any pants.

21:19.025 --> 21:21.485
I didn't think you knew where I lived.

21:21.652 --> 21:23.738
- Air force.
- Right.

21:23.904 --> 21:25.990
Look, I can't really...

21:26.157 --> 21:28.534
I have a date with a girl in 302.

21:28.701 --> 21:31.996
She's been taking care of the cat
while I was away.

21:32.163 --> 21:34.707
- Apparently she... misses me.
- Rodney.

21:34.874 --> 21:38.836
I know, trying to pawn my cat off
on a neighbour and I end up with...

21:39.003 --> 21:41.756
- What?
- I got a call from General Hammond.

21:41.922 --> 21:44.925
There was an accident on the Prometheus.

21:45.092 --> 21:47.803
We can't go back to Atlantis.

21:52.391 --> 21:56.270
I was just gonna come home, unwind,
then start work on a solution.

21:56.437 --> 21:59.190
An hour ago it hit me,
like Archimedes in the bath.

21:59.356 --> 22:02.735
Except I wasn't in the bath.
I was on the couch watching...

22:02.902 --> 22:04.779
- Dr McKay.
- Forget Prometheus.

22:04.945 --> 22:08.991
I have figured out how to establish
a wormhole connection back to Pegasus.

22:09.158 --> 22:12.203
- I'm gonna need the ZPM.
- It's been depleted.

22:12.370 --> 22:16.916
No. Last time it had to establish and
maintain a wormhole back to Atlantis.

22:17.083 --> 22:21.170
This time it just needs enough energy
to establish a brief connection.

22:21.337 --> 22:24.799
My calculation is approximately
3.5 microseconds.

22:24.965 --> 22:26.634
That hardly seems enough...

22:26.801 --> 22:29.845
When we set foot on M5S-224
before the wormhole shut down,

22:30.012 --> 22:31.806
I picked up energy fluctuations.

22:31.972 --> 22:35.643
I assumed it was an effect
of the gate's residual energy signature.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.104
But that can't account for the variances.

22:38.270 --> 22:42.274
There's one explanation. The gate
must have been energised on our arrival.

22:42.441 --> 22:46.404
It doesn't just drop power on outgoing
wormholes, but incoming ones.

22:46.570 --> 22:49.448
We just have to make a connection.
3.5 microseconds.

22:49.615 --> 22:55.204
The minimum amount of time
to confirm a lock before the gate kicks in.

22:55.371 --> 22:59.166
You'll forgive me, Doctor.
This all seems a little far-fetched.

22:59.333 --> 23:02.837
Think of it like calling someone
who will accept the charges.

23:03.003 --> 23:05.673
- All you have to do is dial.
- I'm sorry, Doctor.

23:05.840 --> 23:11.220
You won't lose anything by letting me try.
I just want to run a couple of tests.

23:11.387 --> 23:15.307
All right. I'll have the ZPM
delivered to the lab.

23:15.474 --> 23:17.685
Thank you.

23:35.911 --> 23:38.414
Dr Weir, I wasn't expecting to see you.

23:38.581 --> 23:41.792
I've been thinking about what happened.
Thank you.

23:43.544 --> 23:46.964
I know it's a setback,
but I don't think we should give up yet.

23:47.131 --> 23:50.718
- If we get the Prometheus repaired...
- She was severely damaged.

23:50.885 --> 23:54.597
We lost 20 crew members.
She won't be flying again any time soon.

23:54.764 --> 23:57.641
So we ask the Asgard
for one of their ships.

23:57.808 --> 24:02.188
I'm sure that when the Asgard
are in a position to help, they will.

24:03.147 --> 24:07.943
General, I only came to Earth because
I was assured I'd be able to get back.

24:08.110 --> 24:10.905
I am not about to abandon
my expedition team.

24:12.323 --> 24:15.534
I'll see what I can do,
but I'm not making any promises.

24:20.873 --> 24:23.376
You gotta talk to somebody about this
for me.

24:23.542 --> 24:27.129
Sorry. If those are the orders you received,
it's out of my hands.

24:27.296 --> 24:29.757
I can't abide sloppy work.

24:29.924 --> 24:32.968
Your people
must double-check their results.

24:33.135 --> 24:34.804
- Dr McKay.
- Yes, Lieutenant.

24:34.970 --> 24:37.390
- I'm being transferred.
- Congratulations.

24:37.556 --> 24:42.645
I was with my parents and a sergeant
shows up with new orders for me.

24:42.812 --> 24:45.147
They wanna ship me back to Antarctica.

24:45.314 --> 24:47.483
Do you know something that I don't?

24:47.650 --> 24:50.194
Last time I checked,
the Prometheus was damaged

24:50.361 --> 24:52.988
and our only ZPM
couldn't even run a car stereo.

24:53.155 --> 24:56.742
- I thought you'd find another way.
- There is no other way.

24:56.909 --> 24:59.829
You're gonna have to deal with it.

25:27.231 --> 25:29.567
Thank you.

25:34.613 --> 25:38.159
Would it be so bad if you had to stay?

25:38.325 --> 25:42.246
I'm sorry, Simon.
I know none of this is fair to you.

25:42.413 --> 25:46.667
It is tough to compete with
the greatest adventure in human history.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.798
I don't blame you for going.

25:54.592 --> 25:56.177
Thank you.

25:57.553 --> 26:03.434
But I still feel guilty.
And now I feel guilty about being back.

26:03.601 --> 26:06.562
Because of the people you left behind?

26:06.729 --> 26:09.523
No. I should have stayed at Atlantis.

26:09.690 --> 26:13.736
Major Sheppard should have been
the one to go.

26:19.408 --> 26:21.494
Oh, yeah.

26:21.660 --> 26:23.829
Just like I left it.

26:25.414 --> 26:29.460
So much space for just one person.

26:30.419 --> 26:34.173
Well, a guy's gotta have a lot of space.

26:37.802 --> 26:41.222
I bet there's still...

26:45.559 --> 26:47.728
Perfect.

26:56.570 --> 27:00.199
- Nice and cold.
- And this is...

27:00.366 --> 27:02.868
It's called beer.

27:13.295 --> 27:16.424
Is all this... for recreation?

27:17.466 --> 27:22.054
Yeah. I got pretty much
everything you can imagine, don't I?

27:26.851 --> 27:29.478
What is it?

27:29.645 --> 27:32.732
I was just thinking again...

27:32.898 --> 27:37.778
...about Dr Weir
and everyone else on Atlantis.

27:37.945 --> 27:41.699
Of course. I am sure she is fine.

27:43.909 --> 27:47.246
As I am sure they are all fine.

27:48.581 --> 27:52.001
Yeah. I'm sure.

28:04.096 --> 28:07.725
- You have those test results for me yet?
- We need more time.

28:07.892 --> 28:11.145
What are you talking about?
Let's see what you got.

28:12.480 --> 28:16.025
Wait a minute.
What is this, some kind of a joke?

28:16.192 --> 28:20.529
- I told you we need more time.
- These don't make any sense.

28:21.614 --> 28:24.075
We don't think the ZPM
can open the wormhole.

28:24.241 --> 28:29.288
You wouldn't know that from this.
It's complete gibberish.

28:29.455 --> 28:31.874
Get outta here. I'll do it.

28:32.041 --> 28:34.126
Go.

28:35.378 --> 28:38.089
You've got to be kidding me.

28:39.090 --> 28:41.175
Thank you for coming in again.

28:41.342 --> 28:47.098
- Was there a response to my request?
- We won't need help from the Asgard.

28:47.264 --> 28:53.562
It turns out Dr McKay has discovered
how to open a wormhole back to Pegasus.

28:53.729 --> 28:56.899
He has? Why wasn't I informed?

28:58.567 --> 29:01.904
Doctor, the Atlantis mission
has been reassessed.

29:02.071 --> 29:04.198
What does that mean?

29:05.408 --> 29:08.577
In light of your intelligence
concerning the Wraith,

29:08.744 --> 29:12.748
it's been decided that the Atlantis presence
should be military.

29:13.874 --> 29:17.336
- Our allies have agreed to this?
- They did.

29:17.503 --> 29:20.464
As soon as Dr McKay
can establish a wormhole,

29:20.631 --> 29:25.678
we intend to send reinforcements
along with a new commanding officer.

29:25.845 --> 29:29.640
I'm sorry, Doctor,
but you've been relieved of your duties.

29:29.807 --> 29:34.979
OK, wait. I am not saying there shouldn't
be an increased military presence,

29:35.146 --> 29:39.400
but the mission must remain the same,
and if Major Sheppard were here...

29:39.567 --> 29:44.655
We've spoken to Major Sheppard.
He dialled in to check on your progress.

29:44.822 --> 29:48.117
We informed him of the situation
and he agrees with us.

29:49.035 --> 29:52.747
He wouldn't do that, General.
I know John Sheppard.

29:52.913 --> 29:55.833
Apparently you don't know him
as well as you thought.

29:56.000 --> 30:02.131
He stated categorically it's the only way
to ensure the security of the project.

30:04.925 --> 30:07.178
- Let's get outta here.
- Why?

30:07.344 --> 30:09.430
You wanna see Earth? It's out there.

30:09.597 --> 30:14.602
I thought you'd want to spend time
in your home. Visit with friends.

30:14.769 --> 30:17.271
There is an idea.

30:17.438 --> 30:19.607
<i>(doorbell)</i>

30:19.774 --> 30:22.693
Hey!

30:22.860 --> 30:26.322
Mitch. Dex.

30:26.489 --> 30:30.284
You didn't think you could
pass through town without seeing us?

30:31.410 --> 30:34.205
You gonna invite us in or what?

30:34.372 --> 30:36.457
Yeah, sure. What the hell.

30:37.750 --> 30:40.378
All right! Hi, I'm Dex.

30:56.185 --> 30:59.313
- What is this?
- Is there a problem?

30:59.480 --> 31:03.067
- Elizabeth.
- Rodney, I need to talk to you.

31:03.234 --> 31:06.445
- Can it wait?
- No. Something is very wrong here.

31:07.321 --> 31:11.409
I ran a diagnostic on the ZPM.
These are the results I keep getting back.

31:11.575 --> 31:14.954
- I'm not a scientist.
- Neither's anyone else here.

31:15.121 --> 31:17.707
The laws of physics
have flown out the window.

31:17.873 --> 31:21.627
- Problem with your equipment?
- I checked. It's fine.

31:21.794 --> 31:26.006
If your solution doesn't work,
it's not your fault.

31:26.173 --> 31:30.136
We'll have to accept the fact
that we can't go back.

31:30.302 --> 31:32.555
What?

31:37.852 --> 31:43.107
Our boys were pinned down. Hotshot here
takes his chopper right over this bridge.

31:43.274 --> 31:48.612
- We're supposed to follow him.
- I'm not flying over enemy tanks.

31:48.779 --> 31:50.406
- Over what?
- Tanks.

31:50.573 --> 31:52.908
- You're welcome.
- Ha-ha!

31:54.535 --> 31:57.371
I still love that, man!

31:59.457 --> 32:02.418
Yeah, that was... priceless.

32:02.585 --> 32:06.922
But we got that Special Ops team
out of there, didn't we, Shep?

32:07.089 --> 32:11.218
- Yes, we did.
- That was some flying, Shep.

32:11.969 --> 32:14.305
<i>(doorbell)</i>

32:16.724 --> 32:21.979
- Look who's in the pizza business.
- No, sir. I caught the guy on the way up.

32:22.146 --> 32:25.316
I was thinking about you. Come in.

32:26.484 --> 32:30.780
Looks like we are having a party.

32:30.946 --> 32:33.866
- Yes.
- I got pizza.

32:34.033 --> 32:36.118
All right!

32:38.704 --> 32:42.792
- I've been relieved of my command.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

32:42.958 --> 32:45.503
They're gonna militarise Atlantis.

32:46.796 --> 32:49.673
Interesting. It was bound
to happen sooner or later.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.093
So, you're OK with this?

32:52.259 --> 32:55.179
How did you expect them to react
about the Wraith?

32:55.346 --> 32:57.890
I thought I'd be kept in the loop.

32:58.057 --> 33:00.935
Why don't you go home,
spend some time with Simon?

33:01.102 --> 33:04.647
- Simon?
- He's important to you, isn't he?

33:04.814 --> 33:08.901
Yes. I just don't remember
ever telling you that.

33:12.154 --> 33:14.865
Well, how else would I have known?

33:16.659 --> 33:18.661
We didn't know what to think.

33:18.828 --> 33:23.416
This guy was supposedly one of
the most ruthless warlords in Afghanistan

33:23.582 --> 33:25.251
and he sits at our table.

33:25.418 --> 33:27.878
- Sir, you gotta hear this.
- I was there.

33:28.045 --> 33:32.216
Yeah, you remember. Turns out
he wants to practise his English on us.

33:32.383 --> 33:36.512
- Shep spent half the night talking to him.
- Yeah, that was funny.

33:36.679 --> 33:40.349
He wouldn't even let you
go to the bathroom.

33:43.602 --> 33:48.399
Then two days later
you guys were killed outside Kabul.

33:52.820 --> 33:58.868
These results say this reality
isn't governed by any natural laws.

33:59.035 --> 34:03.372
It's like looking at a cell culture
and seeing a thousand dancing hamsters.

34:03.539 --> 34:07.084
- Rodney, you need to calm down.
- No, I need to get agitated.

34:07.251 --> 34:13.007
I'm realising all of this is a lie.
This and this and this!

34:17.303 --> 34:21.514
- What are you saying?
- Your chopper took an RPG.

34:22.891 --> 34:26.395
There was barely enough left
to bring back for a funeral.

34:26.562 --> 34:29.899
- What?
- You guys have been dead for years.

34:30.690 --> 34:34.652
Don't get me wrong,
it's really nice seeing you.

34:34.820 --> 34:37.364
<i>- You too, Miss Watson.
- (Ford) Sir...</i>

34:37.531 --> 34:40.159
She was my sixth-grade teacher.

34:40.326 --> 34:44.080
I don't remember your name
but I remember you wouldn't date me.

34:44.246 --> 34:46.873
Shep, I think you should see a doctor.

34:47.041 --> 34:50.543
- Oh, really?
- You're acting pretty strange.

34:52.505 --> 34:55.216
I'm acting strange, huh?

35:03.224 --> 35:05.393
Major!

35:10.940 --> 35:13.818
Now you see what I mean?

35:13.984 --> 35:20.616
The McKay I know would never accept
the militarisation of Atlantis without a fight.

35:20.783 --> 35:25.121
I don't think Major Sheppard would
agree to it without speaking to me.

35:25.287 --> 35:28.624
You shouldn't take it personally.
Think of it like a blessing.

35:28.791 --> 35:32.211
You have a life.
You can get back to it now.

35:32.378 --> 35:36.215
No. I'm not buying this any more.
Who are you really?

35:37.299 --> 35:39.385
Who am I? What do you mean?

35:40.219 --> 35:43.389
- You shot me!
- You're already dead!

35:43.556 --> 35:46.058
Sir, give me...

35:46.225 --> 35:50.563
I'm beginning to have my doubts
about you. I wouldn't put them to a test.

35:57.486 --> 36:03.200
Now, somebody explain to me
what the hell is going on here.

36:06.037 --> 36:08.122
Dr Weir.

36:11.250 --> 36:14.378
OK, no more lies. What is this?
What's happening to me?

36:14.545 --> 36:19.133
There's no point in deluding you
any longer.

36:25.056 --> 36:27.683
Now you know.

36:38.819 --> 36:40.279
Where's Rodney?

36:40.446 --> 36:45.201
The real Dr McKay and his team
reside in their own illusory worlds.

36:46.327 --> 36:48.579
I wanna see them. Please.

36:59.799 --> 37:01.467
What happened?

37:01.634 --> 37:04.720
I drew you together
from your fractured realities.

37:04.887 --> 37:09.475
- I'm talking about the beer I had.
- Sheppard discovered the truth first.

37:09.642 --> 37:13.896
- He did?
- Home was a research base in Antarctica.

37:15.231 --> 37:19.235
Although I did dream
about a bachelor pad like that.

37:19.402 --> 37:24.073
He seemed uniquely capable
of manipulating his own fabricated reality.

37:24.240 --> 37:26.742
The scenarios I could have cooked up!

37:26.909 --> 37:30.621
The realities you experienced
were fabrications of your own minds.

37:30.788 --> 37:36.419
Since you had no memories of Earth,
you shared in Major Sheppard's illusion.

37:37.336 --> 37:39.213
I thought that was you.

37:39.380 --> 37:42.299
It's unfortunate
you all became aware so quickly.

37:42.466 --> 37:46.387
However, you may now create
a fabricated reality of your own choosing

37:46.554 --> 37:48.806
for the remainder of your lives.

37:48.973 --> 37:52.101
- What?
- That's not gonna work for us.

37:52.268 --> 37:56.230
I'm afraid
the matter's beyond your control.

37:56.981 --> 38:02.111
- Well, we'll find a way to fight you.
- That would be quite impossible, Major.

38:02.278 --> 38:06.073
Even now you are simply experiencing
a shared fabrication.

38:06.907 --> 38:09.827
It's best if you try
to make a life for yourselves.

38:09.994 --> 38:13.539
This isn't life.
What do you want us to do, just pretend?

38:13.706 --> 38:16.417
I'm sorry, but that's all I can offer you.

38:16.584 --> 38:19.003
Wait.

38:19.545 --> 38:22.548
- Why would you do this?
- To protect ourselves.

38:23.549 --> 38:25.634
From us?

38:25.801 --> 38:28.429
We did not intend to harm anyone.

38:28.596 --> 38:31.265
Unlike you,
we exist in a non-corporeal form

38:31.432 --> 38:35.686
susceptible to the destructive effects
of the Stargate on our home world.

38:35.853 --> 38:37.396
What destructive effects?

38:37.563 --> 38:41.108
The energy readings we had
were life signs. You were in the mist.

38:41.275 --> 38:45.571
We are the mist. Every time
the gate is activated, lives are lost.

38:45.738 --> 38:50.951
Over time, explorers have come and gone,
completely unaware of our existence.

38:51.118 --> 38:54.372
Sacrifices are made to ensure our secrecy.

38:54.538 --> 38:56.707
When you came back,
we grew concerned.

38:56.874 --> 39:01.128
To learn your intentions,
we had no choice but to enter your minds.

39:01.295 --> 39:05.758
When we discovered what you'd do, we
were forced to take preventive measures.

39:06.384 --> 39:09.136
You said you'd let others come and go.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.389
Why not allow us to do the same?

39:11.555 --> 39:14.975
Your desire to return to your home world
was too strong.

39:15.142 --> 39:19.939
The energy required to gate to another
galaxy would have killed millions of us.

39:23.776 --> 39:26.529
So when we dialled the gate...

39:26.696 --> 39:30.741
You never dialled the gate.
You just imagined you did.

39:30.908 --> 39:33.953
You are unconscious even now
on the planet's surface.

39:34.120 --> 39:36.205
So none of this is real?

39:38.249 --> 39:40.334
The cute brunette. Of course.

39:40.501 --> 39:44.672
How do you go from "You're a pig
but I like your cat" to "I missed you"?

39:44.839 --> 39:48.676
We lacked a sophisticated understanding
of your world.

39:48.843 --> 39:53.514
As a result, the illusions we created
from your thoughts were ultimately flawed.

39:53.681 --> 39:57.101
The dead people were... a dead giveaway.

39:57.268 --> 39:59.437
Dead people? What were you doing?

39:59.603 --> 40:03.649
- If you had just told us...
- Wait. I just realised something.

40:03.816 --> 40:06.652
Our unconscious bodies
are still on the planet?

40:06.819 --> 40:10.698
- Yes.
- So we need food, we need water, food.

40:10.865 --> 40:12.992
We won't live long in this state.

40:13.159 --> 40:15.786
Make the most of the time you have left.

40:16.704 --> 40:18.914
You're killing us to save yourselves.

40:19.081 --> 40:23.377
In order to save millions of our kind.
I believe you would do the same.

40:23.544 --> 40:27.381
If we do not go back,
our friends will come looking for us.

40:27.548 --> 40:30.176
- Others of your kind?
- They'll show up.

40:30.342 --> 40:33.971
What you gonna do, kill them too?

40:34.138 --> 40:37.600
- More will come.
- They'll work out how to access the gate.

40:37.767 --> 40:40.227
Then millions of your kind will die.

40:44.899 --> 40:46.984
We don't leave people behind,

40:47.151 --> 40:50.654
and if you were really General Hammond,
you'd know that.

40:53.949 --> 40:59.288
But if you allow us to leave here,
we promise we will never return, ever.

41:00.122 --> 41:04.752
You will not have to fear us ever again.
I give you my word.

41:06.045 --> 41:09.673
How can you make such a promise
when you so desire to return home?

41:10.925 --> 41:13.677
Sure, we'd like to go home.

41:13.844 --> 41:17.014
We're not willing to kill millions
of your kind to do it.

41:18.140 --> 41:21.852
You've been in our heads.
You're in our heads right now.

41:22.019 --> 41:24.855
You should know we mean that.

41:36.701 --> 41:38.369
I understand.

41:57.930 --> 42:00.725
<i>(grunts)</i>

42:06.689 --> 42:10.401
I don't mean to sound negative
because that would be so not me,

42:10.568 --> 42:14.155
but how do we know this isn't
a double fake-out? How do we know...

42:14.321 --> 42:18.784
<i>(Hammond) This is your reality.
You have my word.</i>

42:21.746 --> 42:26.250
- I'm starving. He's gotta be right.
- I wonder how long we've been out.

42:26.417 --> 42:30.838
I need to get the control crystal
out of the DHD. Shouldn't take long.

42:31.005 --> 42:33.090
I'll give you a hand.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.803
Thank you for trusting us.

42:40.514 --> 42:44.560
Rodney, be careful with that.
I wanna make sure we can get back home.

42:44.727 --> 42:47.897
- You mean Atlantis.
- I think that's what she meant.

42:48.064 --> 42:51.525
She could have meant we pull
a double fake-out and dial Earth.

42:51.692 --> 42:56.280
Forget the double fake-out and get
the damn crystal. I'll do the dial-out.
