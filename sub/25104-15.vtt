WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.202
Only on Fox.

00:05.105 --> 00:06.740
- Narrator: Tonight...
- Judges: Switch!

00:06.774 --> 00:08.241
- Go, go, go, go!
- Bleah!

00:08.275 --> 00:10.544
...the race to be
the next MasterChef...

00:10.578 --> 00:12.713
- Whack the garlic!
- ...kicks into high gear...

00:12.746 --> 00:15.816
- Let's go!
- ...in an explosive tag team
challenge.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.484
Don't be scared of the fire!

00:17.517 --> 00:19.853
Have you never cooked
over a ( bleep ) grill?

00:19.887 --> 00:21.354
Who will cross
the finish line?

00:21.388 --> 00:23.156
- Perfect.
- Oh, man, that's hot.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.158
And who will fall short?

00:25.192 --> 00:27.527
- 60 seconds to go!
- They're so burnt.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.664
- Ugh, this chicken is raw, Sam.
- It's burned.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.500
- Oh, my God.
- Get it on the plate.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.769
- Oh, my God.
- Is he okay?

00:48.782 --> 00:52.519
- Yo, top nine.
- Gordon: Good evening.

00:52.552 --> 00:56.389
Top nine, baby.
This is one heck
of a milestone.

00:56.423 --> 01:00.761
Come down here
and stand behind a box
at random.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.030
- Yeah.
- Gerron: Being a English
teacher,

01:03.063 --> 01:06.967
my full dream is to open up
a culinary program
at my school,

01:07.000 --> 01:10.570
and I am this much closer
to making it happen.

01:10.604 --> 01:12.740
So I gotta keep pushing

01:12.773 --> 01:15.108
until I get
that MasterChef trophy, baby.

01:15.142 --> 01:21.081
Tonight, you're about to face
your next big mystery box
challenge.

01:21.114 --> 01:24.251
Okay, on the count of three,
please lift them.

01:24.284 --> 01:28.055
One, two, three, lift.

01:28.088 --> 01:29.923
- ( gasps )
- Ooh.

01:29.957 --> 01:32.325
- Peaches.
- Oh, lobster. Yes.

01:32.359 --> 01:36.329
- Clams.
- Nine amazing American
ingredients.

01:36.363 --> 01:41.001
- Oh, nice.
- Under each mystery box
is a different ingredient

01:41.034 --> 01:43.904
that America was built on.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.741
Aarón:
You can each use your ingredient
to make any dish you like,

01:47.775 --> 01:50.343
as long as that ingredient
is the star.

01:50.377 --> 01:53.080
Joe:
For this mystery box challenge,
you have 45 minutes

01:53.113 --> 01:55.949
to make a delicious
and beautiful dish.

01:55.983 --> 01:59.787
But listen, before you all go
to shop in the pantry,

01:59.820 --> 02:02.756
we are each going to take
our mentees

02:02.790 --> 02:05.525
and spend a few minutes
with you.

02:05.558 --> 02:09.362
- Let's go.
- Go, go, go, go.
Move, move, move.

02:09.396 --> 02:11.264
- ( Gordon laughing )
- Thank you.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.500
- Thank you, thank you.
- No problem, Joe.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.535
Joe:
All right, guys.

02:15.568 --> 02:17.204
All right, Team Sanchez.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.873
We entered this kitchen with 24.
You're in the top nine.

02:19.907 --> 02:21.675
- Yeah.
- Look where you've come.
I'm so proud

02:21.709 --> 02:24.144
that you've lasted so long.
Yes, it's been tough.

02:24.177 --> 02:27.214
You're up against
tough competition,
but you are getting stronger.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.850
Think what you've done.
Think how good your palate is.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.519
Taylor:
To get feedback
from Gordon Ramsay

02:32.552 --> 02:34.855
is an experience
of a lifetime.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.957
I mean,
this is Gordon Ramsay.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.893
Every time we cook
in this incredible kitchen,
give it your all.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.661
Start those first 15 minutes
faster.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.896
Get everything around you
that you want.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.965
What you don't need,
get rid of,

02:44.998 --> 02:46.734
and then get that clear
perspective of what
you're doing.

02:46.767 --> 02:49.202
You have to show me
and show the other contestants

02:49.236 --> 02:51.038
- where you guys are
in this final nine.
- Okay.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.307
This is really a moment
to stake your claim.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.675
You've both had
ups and downs

02:55.709 --> 02:57.044
and I think we're
in a good point,

02:57.077 --> 02:58.712
you two at least,
at least in your trajectory.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.513
- So today we'll take it
to the next level.
- Okay.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.349
It is so motivating to have
this one-on-one with Joe.

03:02.382 --> 03:03.984
It's been a long journey

03:04.017 --> 03:07.020
and this advice is what I need
right now to keep going.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.989
You need to have
beautiful dishes.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.524
They need to reflect
the Americanness
of these ingredients.

03:11.558 --> 03:13.360
- Mm-hmm.
- I only have two
of you guys left.

03:13.393 --> 03:14.728
This is, like,
big stakes for me.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.263
I want to see finesse.

03:16.296 --> 03:18.999
I want to see concise,
beautiful plating,

03:19.032 --> 03:21.068
and I want those flavors
to pop.

03:21.101 --> 03:24.271
Chef Aarón has such
a high standard that he holds
to everything.

03:24.304 --> 03:29.609
Harness your idea,
commit, and don't let fear
command who you are.

03:29.642 --> 03:32.212
Cesar:
To be able to talk to him
and hear his advice

03:32.245 --> 03:35.115
raises the bar of expectation
for myself.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.018
I want each one of you
to show me that you can be
the next MasterChef.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.386
- Yes.
- Let's go get 'em.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.021
- All right, let's go.
- Come on.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.923
Show everyone that you guys
are contenders, okay?

03:42.956 --> 03:45.525
- We got you.
We won't let you down.
- All right. Good luck.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.261
I'm expecting great things.
I want you to get
to the finale.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.662
All of you.
Let's go.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.401
By your station.

03:54.434 --> 03:56.837
Down to the front,
thank you.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.907
Right.
Back to the task at hand.

03:59.940 --> 04:03.076
Now to help you make
the best possible dish,

04:03.110 --> 04:07.647
all of you have access
to the best pantry anywhere
in the world.

04:09.449 --> 04:11.584
This would be a great
mystery box challenge to win

04:11.618 --> 04:15.155
because the advantage
tonight is huge.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.224
- Is everyone ready?
- All: Yes, Chef.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.260
Your 45 minutes start...

04:21.761 --> 04:23.897
...now.
Come on, guys.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.665
- Aarón: Think about
your elements.
- Gordon: Wow.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.367
Aarón: Come on, Cesar.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.738
Okra, parsnips, no.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.807
Okay, celery?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.343
I am so happy that potatoes
is my ingredient

04:36.376 --> 04:38.445
because potatoes
are so classic.

04:38.478 --> 04:42.115
- Anybody see celery?
- No celery.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.516
So I'm gonna make
a cream of potato soup

04:43.550 --> 04:45.618
with marinated grilled shrimp.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.420
Oh, celery's right here.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.122
Crispy fried potatoes,

04:49.156 --> 04:51.458
and then garnishing it
with some truffle oil...

04:51.491 --> 04:53.160
Right above your head.

04:53.193 --> 04:55.829
...just to bring it up a notch.
This is always so heavy.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.430
- Let's go, guys.
- Whoo-wee.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.532
Bowen, I think you need
a few more ingredients, no?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.636
Okay.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.941
My dad is Cuban,
so I am doing a twist

05:07.975 --> 05:10.610
on an American/Cubano dish.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.947
Gonna do a corn and mango puree,
grilled corn salad,

05:13.981 --> 05:17.617
and I'm also gonna do
some corn fritters.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.886
There.

05:22.422 --> 05:25.325
So, tonight we are
celebrating America

05:25.358 --> 05:28.361
and some real staples
of American agriculture,

05:28.395 --> 05:32.199
like potatoes, tomatoes.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.734
- And then from the sea,
we have lobster.
- Sorry, my man.

05:34.767 --> 05:36.403
Joe:
From the mountains,
we have venison.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.071
But this is
a difficult challenge, Joe.

05:38.105 --> 05:39.907
There are some tricky
ingredients out there tonight.

05:39.940 --> 05:42.976
I'm not sure that's working
quite well.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.811
Gordon:
You know how difficult those
littleneck clams are to cook.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.980
Whoo.
( chuckles )

05:47.014 --> 05:49.516
- Glasses are the worst.
- Gordon: The butternut squash.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.718
Do you turn it into a dessert?
Do you go savory?

05:51.751 --> 05:53.686
At this stage of the game,
top nine,

05:53.720 --> 05:55.555
they should be able to adapt.

05:55.588 --> 05:58.525
Today is a day that I want to
see how far they've come

05:58.558 --> 06:00.227
since the beginning
of this competition.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.294
Gerron:
There we go, baby.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.865
Come together.

06:05.899 --> 06:09.036
For my mystery box ingredient,
I got butternut squash,

06:09.069 --> 06:12.906
so I'm combining the butternut
squash with the taco that's
loved by all Americans.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.043
So I'm going to make
butternut squash tacos

06:16.076 --> 06:17.677
with butternut squash tortillas

06:17.710 --> 06:20.247
and crispy bacon, shallots,
garlic as the filling.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.017
Get it in there.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.586
In Texas,
my family hunts a lot,

06:26.619 --> 06:29.022
so I'm familiar with the taste
of venison,

06:29.056 --> 06:32.725
so I am making
a pan-seared venison

06:32.759 --> 06:36.563
with a purple cauliflower
puree.

06:36.596 --> 06:39.466
Aarón:
Just 25 minutes.
Let's go!

06:39.499 --> 06:40.934
- Gerron.
- What's up, Chef?

06:40.968 --> 06:43.370
Georgia peaches.
Tell me about the dish.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.639
- Today I'm going to do
my peach bread pudding.
- How beautiful.

06:46.673 --> 06:48.541
Then I'm making a regular
whipped cream.

06:48.575 --> 06:52.412
This is something
that my grandma makes
every family event.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.714
How important is it for you
to win this thing?

06:54.747 --> 06:57.884
It's very important because
I've never gotten an advantage
in this competition,

06:57.917 --> 07:00.954
- and so it's my time.
- Do me proud. Good luck.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.057
- Right, Samantha.
- Chef.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.426
You unveiled that box
and you had those
amazing clams.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.562
Yes, Chef. In Iowa,
you don't get fresh clams
like this.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.965
I'm extremely nervous.
I've never even eaten a clam.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.767
But, you know,
I strongly believe in myself
right now.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.338
I'm trying to face my fears
head on, so I'm going to be
making a clam linguini

07:18.371 --> 07:22.642
with a lot of lemon in it
and umami flavors from
some mushrooms.

07:22.675 --> 07:25.945
- You are in the top nine
of this, come on.
- Top nine.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.580
- It's incredible,
it's incredible.
- Come on.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.082
- Yeah.
- How excited are you?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.984
- So excited.
- Don't let yourself down,

07:31.018 --> 07:32.585
- and don't let me down.
- Yes, Chef.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.054
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.692
Ashley, talk to me.
Explain to me the ingredient

07:39.726 --> 07:41.261
that you have here
that you're celebrating.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.496
I have some beautiful
cranberries

07:43.530 --> 07:46.366
and I'm going for
a French Moroccan-inspired
duck breast.

07:46.399 --> 07:49.702
And I'm going to also do
a granola as well.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.339
I have never in my life
made this before.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.041
I told Gordon
when he gave me that apron,

07:54.074 --> 07:57.810
I was going to be a risk taker,
and I am doing it today.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.746
- Ashley, best of luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.950
Gordon: Guys, you're down
to five minutes to go.

08:03.983 --> 08:06.319
All right, Farhan, lobster.
What's the dish? Tell me.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.721
You know, lobster
is an ingredient
I've never used before,

08:08.755 --> 08:11.824
but I really wanted
to respect it and use it
in as many ways as possible.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.327
So I'm gonna do
lobster in three ways:
Tandoori lobster,

08:14.361 --> 08:16.663
a lobster bisque,
and poached lobster.

08:16.696 --> 08:18.965
- And I put ginger, lemongrass,
put some starch in it.
- Wow.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.734
You're really kinda going at it.
You have 8,000 ingredients.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.837
It's the top nine now,
so I really want to do my best.

08:24.871 --> 08:26.506
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Joe.

08:26.539 --> 08:28.908
Gordon:
90 seconds to go.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.544
Some great dishes.
I'm super excited.

08:31.578 --> 08:33.213
I need something to slice
my duck on.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.316
- Ooh, that's a long noodle.
- Finesse, garnish.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.218
Presentation, please.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.420
Joe: We can't taste it if you
don't get it on the plate.

08:40.453 --> 08:44.657
- Gordon: Let's go. Ten.
- Judges: Nine, eight, seven,

08:44.691 --> 08:47.694
six, five, four,

08:47.727 --> 08:50.163
three, two, one...

08:50.197 --> 08:52.465
- Aarón: Let's go.
- Gordon: And stop.
Hands in the air.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.905
Gordon:
Well done, all of you.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.074
We're extremely excited
to see what you guys did

09:01.108 --> 09:05.612
with your mystery box
ingredients that America
was built on.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.914
Gordon: Now, you know,
we miss nothing.

09:07.947 --> 09:11.184
We taste as we talk,
and we study everything you do.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.952
Aarón:
And there are three dishes

09:12.985 --> 09:17.124
that we would like to examine
a little closer.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.259
Gordon:
The first dish
that we want to bring forward

09:19.292 --> 09:21.894
had a lot of flair,
great harmony.

09:21.928 --> 09:26.799
This young individual
had their personality stamped
all over this dish.

09:26.833 --> 09:28.668
Please step forward...

09:30.970 --> 09:32.739
...Ashley.

09:32.772 --> 09:35.375
Yes!
I am so stoked right now

09:35.408 --> 09:40.580
because every week I strive
to make Gordon Ramsay proud,

09:40.613 --> 09:46.553
and I really believe
that I have made him proud
with this dish.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.488
Right, young lady,
describe the dish, please.

09:48.521 --> 09:51.791
Ashley: This is a French and
Moroccan-inspired duck breast

09:51.824 --> 09:56.629
with a cranberry relish,
savory cranberry
and walnut granola,

09:56.663 --> 09:59.432
horseradish cream,
and roasted Romanesco.

09:59.466 --> 10:03.636
I look at that dish
and it's just got
that wow factor.

10:03.670 --> 10:04.904
Tell me about
the cranberries.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.639
The cranberries are used
in three ways:

10:06.673 --> 10:08.441
in the juice
to baste the duck,

10:08.475 --> 10:12.078
cranberry relish,
and cranberry
and walnut granola.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.281
Uh, delicious.

10:14.314 --> 10:17.650
Cranberries, exuberant,
tangy, sour, sweet.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.820
I love that little granola
on top, just love that idea
in general,

10:20.853 --> 10:23.590
especially with something
so rich and gamey.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.593
What would I change?
The duck could do
with two minutes less,

10:26.626 --> 10:29.362
but you cooked it skin side down
so the duck's tender.

10:29.396 --> 10:32.131
This is magical for me,

10:32.165 --> 10:34.301
your best performance so far
in this competition.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.136
You're a threat and
and I think everybody
behind you sees that.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.605
Great job, seriously.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.607
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.874
( applause )

10:46.045 --> 10:51.651
The second cook we want
to focus on tonight
took a real risk.

10:51.684 --> 10:54.120
Please step forward...

10:54.153 --> 10:55.154
Gerron.

10:57.390 --> 11:01.461
What? Turn up!
This is my first
mystery box top three,

11:01.494 --> 11:04.831
and I am feeling so good.
Is this real?

11:04.864 --> 11:07.567
My grandma's recipe
is the best.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.903
Mama Lizzie,
I'm making you proud.
I love you.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.972
Gerron, nice to be up here,
huh?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.308
Very nice to be up here.
I can't believe it.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.043
Joe:
All right, what's the dish?
Tell me.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.979
Gerron:
So what this is
is a peach bread pudding.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.849
I dunked the bread
in condensed milk and spices.

11:22.882 --> 11:24.651
With the pecans,
I just candied 'em,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.919
then I finished it off
with a bourbon glaze.

11:26.953 --> 11:30.757
This is beautiful plating.
Who gave you the idea of using
a cast-iron pan?

11:30.790 --> 11:32.559
My grandmother taught me
a dessert.

11:32.592 --> 11:35.428
This is something that she makes
for every single holiday.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.397
And so I knew
it was the perfect thing
to put it in

11:37.430 --> 11:39.299
to get that perfect texture.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.070
This is so good.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.606
And it's, like, rich
and has good acidity,

11:46.639 --> 11:48.241
and the peaches
are properly cooked.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.878
- Thank you, Joe.
- I taste home in this dish.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.781
I can taste
your grandmother's kitchen.

11:54.814 --> 11:58.951
- Thank you.
- No, thank you for bringing
a piece of who you are.

11:58.985 --> 12:02.021
Coming out as
a real contender.
It's an amazing job.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.357
- Thank you.
- Wow.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.393
( applause )

12:12.632 --> 12:17.570
Aarón:
And the third and final dish
belongs to a home cook

12:17.604 --> 12:20.273
who made an extremely
ambitious dish this evening.

12:22.942 --> 12:25.211
Please step forward...

12:25.244 --> 12:27.880
Farhan.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.816
Farhan:
It feels great
to be recognized,

12:29.849 --> 12:31.784
especially with an ingredient
I've never worked with before.

12:31.818 --> 12:34.253
I mean, I've been in college
for eight years.

12:34.287 --> 12:38.591
I can't afford a lobster,
so for me it's actually
pretty cool.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.992
Farhan, describe the dish,
please.

12:40.026 --> 12:41.961
Farhan:
This is Lobster Three Ways,

12:41.994 --> 12:43.930
so it's a saffron
lobster bisque,

12:43.963 --> 12:46.165
a Ghee poached
lobster claw,

12:46.198 --> 12:48.234
and then a Tandoori
lobster tail.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.136
First of all, visually,
it makes a statement.

12:50.169 --> 12:53.139
I think it's whimsical.
I think it's fun.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.475
You know,
I grew up in America.
I'm full-blooded American,

12:55.508 --> 12:58.845
but there's no reason why
I can't bring my heritage

12:58.878 --> 13:02.281
into something that's
classically American
like a lobster bisque.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.652
Lobster's cooked perfect.
Really phenomenal job.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.188
You have a beautiful balance
of tart, sweet, rich.

13:09.221 --> 13:10.990
It's firing
on all cylinders, man.

13:11.023 --> 13:13.526
You didn't make the mistake
by having too much bisque.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.428
You really let the lobster
be the star.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.297
The one thing I do not like
about the bisque

13:18.331 --> 13:20.600
- is you use coconut milk
in a lot of your preparations.
- Sure.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.836
And I'm pleading with you
to stop using that ingredient
all the time

13:23.870 --> 13:26.439
'cause you have some many other
interesting elements
happening there

13:26.473 --> 13:28.541
- that you don't need coconut
milk, okay?
- Farhan: Heard, Chef.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.043
But other than that,
I think you have a home run.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.345
- Thank you so much.
- Great job.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.020
( Chefs muttering )

13:41.053 --> 13:42.555
- Yeah.
- Yes. Agreed.

13:42.589 --> 13:43.590
Cool.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.993
Aarón:
Your three dishes

13:47.026 --> 13:49.061
really knocked
it out the park tonight.

13:49.095 --> 13:53.132
But only one cook
can be the winner.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.002
Tonight's winner will get
a huge advantage

13:56.035 --> 13:58.405
in the next stage
of the competition.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.411
The home cook
with the best dish...

14:04.444 --> 14:06.379
congratulations...

14:15.087 --> 14:17.924
There can only be
one winner.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.794
The home cook
with the best dish...

14:23.362 --> 14:25.765
is...

14:25.798 --> 14:28.901
- Gerron.
- Yes! Yes, baby!

14:28.935 --> 14:30.770
( clamoring )

14:30.803 --> 14:34.441
This feeling that I have
right now is irreplaceable.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.909
I've never won a mystery box
challenge before,

14:36.943 --> 14:40.079
and I did it with one
of my grandma's recipes.

14:40.112 --> 14:43.450
Well done, Gerron.
You are safe from elimination.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.351
Come join us up here.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.754
This confirms how much
I've grown as a chef.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.456
Gordon:
Line up, please. Thank you.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.390
Gerron: Ain't nothing gonna
hold me back.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.126
I'm going to continue
making my mentor, Joe, proud.

14:54.160 --> 14:58.598
Gerron, you are about to receive
a game-changing advantage.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.401
All of these home cooks
in front of you

15:02.435 --> 15:03.970
will be competing tonight,

15:04.003 --> 15:07.607
but they'll be competing
in teams of two.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.241
( exhales deeply )

15:09.275 --> 15:12.411
This is "MasterChef"
tag team challenge.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.781
Oh, God.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.983
- ( groans )
- Okay.

15:17.016 --> 15:18.718
Guess who gets to pick
the teams.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.920
Oh, shoot!
It's on.

15:20.953 --> 15:25.224
So, Gerron, tell me
one individual that you
would like to see go home.

15:25.257 --> 15:29.261
So this person is
a very, very strong contender
in the MasterChef kitchen.

15:29.295 --> 15:32.532
- Cesar.
- Cesar, please stand over
to the side.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.769
Gerron, who are you gonna
pair with Cesar?

15:38.771 --> 15:40.673
I'm gonna pair Bowen
with Cesar.

15:40.707 --> 15:43.676
Aarón:
Bowen, please walk over
and join him.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.411
Bowen doesn't really
communicate effectively.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.747
He gets very flustered
under pressure,

15:47.780 --> 15:50.983
and Cesar is very
soft-spoken,

15:51.017 --> 15:52.985
so if these two people
cannot communicate,

15:53.019 --> 15:55.254
then there is no way
that they can do well.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.825
Right, onto the next team.
Second person you'd like
to see leave tonight.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.160
- Samantha.
- Gordon: Wow.

16:01.193 --> 16:04.463
Gerron: She is producing
great dishes each time
she steps in the kitchen.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.198
Who are you pairing
with Samantha?

16:06.232 --> 16:09.969
This person is very,
very strong-minded,

16:10.002 --> 16:12.872
but she may not be as successful
in this challenge

16:12.905 --> 16:16.342
depending on
how she works in a team.

16:16.375 --> 16:19.178
- Who is it?
- Shanika.

16:19.211 --> 16:21.881
I'm hoping that these
personalities clash.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.950
Shanika:
I'm a little bit nervous.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.986
Samantha is very young.
I've seen her crack
under pressure.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.857
So, I'm hoping for the best
right now.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.325
Joe: Gerron,
who are you targeting next?

16:33.359 --> 16:37.229
Julia.
She is definitely experienced.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.365
Uh, restaurant,
baking.

16:39.398 --> 16:43.836
So, Gerron, obviously this pick
selects the remainder
of the teams,

16:43.870 --> 16:46.839
- so it's the big one.
- Taylor.

16:46.873 --> 16:50.042
I set Taylor and Julia
up to fail

16:50.076 --> 16:52.712
because Julia has a lot
of experience,

16:52.745 --> 16:55.047
and she has a very strong
personality.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.049
Taylor kinda gets choppy
under pressure,

16:57.083 --> 16:59.051
and so they're gonna
go down.

16:59.085 --> 17:02.221
That means Farhan and Ashley,
you are also a team.

17:02.254 --> 17:05.191
Okay, everybody,
please come and stand
in front of us.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.761
Aarón: So, Gerron,
your work in the MasterChef
kitchen is done.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.598
You can head up to that balcony
for a front row seat.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.032
Off you go, big boy,
come on.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.267
Lucky, lucky.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.607
Tonight you'll be making...

17:23.442 --> 17:26.045
a perfect platter of...

17:28.648 --> 17:31.851
- Mediterranean food.
- Oh, my gosh.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.353
Joe:
Here we have spanakopita,

17:34.386 --> 17:37.924
a phyllo dough
stuffed with spinach and feta,

17:37.957 --> 17:41.127
chicken skewers,
peppers and onions

17:41.160 --> 17:43.596
with coriander
and lemon marinade.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.733
Of course we have hummus
with grilled pita chips,

17:46.766 --> 17:50.870
and falafels
with tahini dipping sauce.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.106
And last, but not least,
lamb kofta

17:54.140 --> 17:56.575
with yogurt
and cucumber sauce.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.577
Samantha: I'm so excited.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.279
My entire extended family
is Greek.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.815
My sister and I are actually
baptized Greek Orthodox,

18:02.849 --> 18:06.452
so I grew up with Greek food,
so I feel confident
in this challenge.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.154
I just hope I can do
Gordon proud.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.089
Aarón:
With a tag team challenge,

18:10.122 --> 18:13.325
your communication skills
are gonna need to be spot-on

18:13.359 --> 18:15.828
because you will not
be able to work on your dish

18:15.862 --> 18:18.765
at the same time
as your partner.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.101
Here's how it works, guys.
One of you starts cooking.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.070
When we yell, "Switch,"

18:24.103 --> 18:26.505
you will trade positions
immediately.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.108
The person starting will not
be the person finishing.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.110
So think about your strategy.

18:31.143 --> 18:35.514
Those choices could make
or break your team.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.617
Okay, please, everyone,
head to your stations.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.286
Farhan:
I'm feeling a little scared
right now.

18:40.319 --> 18:42.621
Tag team challenges
brings out the worst in people.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.457
and if Ashley and I don't
communicate with each other,

18:45.491 --> 18:47.093
that would be
a disaster.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.696
Everything you need
is on the station behind you.

18:49.729 --> 18:52.965
You have a selection
of incredible ingredients.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.968
All right, guys,
I want the home cook
finishing this challenge

18:56.002 --> 18:59.138
to step to the end
of the station.
Let's go.

18:59.171 --> 19:04.911
You have just 60 minutes
to make us an immaculate
Mediterranean platter.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.314
Your 60 minutes...

19:08.347 --> 19:10.149
starts...

19:10.182 --> 19:12.184
- ...now.
- Let's go.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.687
- Come on, guys.
- All right, Sam.
Get everything prepped.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.824
- We're moving, we're moving.
- Cesar, come on. You got this.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.893
- Dump. Quick.
- Meat, meat, meat, meat, meat.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.529
- Lamb going in.
- Awesome. Go. Go, go, go.

19:23.562 --> 19:27.033
Guys, by far the most difficult
platter ever in the history
of this tag team challenge.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.635
- First thing, spanakopita.
- Season it with some salt
and pepper.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.537
- Yes.
- Cooking the spinach, seasoning
beautifully with the nutmeg

19:31.570 --> 19:33.472
- is instrumental.
- Multitask.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.374
And then
the difficult falafel.

19:35.407 --> 19:37.844
Julia:
I think it's too full.
Take some out, Taylor.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.479
Gordon: They could break up
and disintegrate in the fryer
in seconds.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.249
Chicken skewers looks easy,
but it's not.

19:43.282 --> 19:46.819
It needs a little
more coriander.
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.388
The chicken, being
a very neutral protein, has to
have the right seasoning.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.357
- Just a pinch of salt
and pepper.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.992
- Joe: Very, very tricky balance
there.
- You got this, you got this.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.660
Let's go, spice boy.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.829
And last, but not least,
the lamb kofta.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.431
- We're gonna season the outside
of those when it's done.
- Yep.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.168
- All right.
- Joe: The lamb is gamey.
It wants spice,

20:02.201 --> 20:04.837
and then the yogurt sauce
has to be the cooling agent.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.606
- Cesar, that's too thin.
- For the yogurt sauce,
we need it thin.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.341
- Joe: Gotta nail both.
- Yep.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.543
- Move faster. Multitask,
multitask.
- Okay.

20:11.577 --> 20:14.180
- I'm moving as fast as I can.
- This is all
about communication.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.448
Stand there silent,
you're in trouble.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.752
- What do you want me to do
for the lamb?
- Um, salt and pepper.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.221
What else?
Come on, talk to me, buddy.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.090
I need you to talk me through
what else we're missing.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.859
30 seconds to go
till our first swap.

20:26.893 --> 20:30.129
All right, I really want you
to take care of the spanakopita.

20:30.162 --> 20:33.265
- Okay, yes, of course.
- Get the phyllo dough ready,
all right? Let's do this!

20:33.299 --> 20:34.867
There was only two peppers,
I think.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.202
Quick as you can, Taylor.
Time is going by fast.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.237
All right. All right.
Yep, yep, yep.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.639
- Okay, what do you
want me to do?
- Just chop the rims off.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.608
No, we don't even need that
'cause it's gonna go
in the processor.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.777
- Stand by.
- I'm gonna be leaving
the butter melting

20:44.811 --> 20:46.946
and the garlic in there.
Check the seasoning.
We need some herbs in there.

20:46.979 --> 20:52.051
Judges:
Five, four, three, two, one.
Switch!

20:52.084 --> 20:53.485
Go for it, Bowen! Bleah!

20:53.519 --> 20:55.287
- A little more lemon.
- Go.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.889
Spanakopita's up first.
I already got the cheese
in there.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.058
- Yes.
- All right,
pine nuts are good.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.426
Uh, come on, Bowen.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.428
Where's-- where's my skewer?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.230
The lamb we need
to finish first.

21:04.263 --> 21:05.932
Okay. I'm looking
for the skewer.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.334
Hey, Bowen, Bowen,
we need to test the lamb

21:08.367 --> 21:10.636
to make sure
the seasoning is good.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.671
- Come on, Bowen, come on.
- Oh, my God.

21:12.704 --> 21:16.075
- What the--
- Come on, Bowen, don't frazzle,
don't frazzle.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.776
Gerron:
Bowen is falling apart,

21:17.810 --> 21:19.812
and he's getting flustered
under pressure.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.613
- Where is the--
- Bowen, Bowen, Bowen,
listen to me.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.015
Bowen's all over the place.

21:23.049 --> 21:25.017
What's he doing?
Is he okay?

21:25.051 --> 21:27.353
- Bowen, keep cool.
Keep cool, buddy.
- Okay, okay, okay.

21:27.386 --> 21:30.622
This is exactly
what I wanted to happen.

21:30.656 --> 21:33.025
- Oh, my God.
- Make decisions, Bowen.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.293
Oh, my God.

21:34.326 --> 21:36.362
My mind is going
so crazy.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.371
Come on, Bowen.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.839
- Gordon: What's he doing?
- Don't lose it, don't lose it.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.207
- Bowen: Oh, my God.
- Gordon: Is he okay?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.475
Bowen's all over the place.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.978
- Oh, my God.
- Make decisions, Bowen.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.312
- Oh, my God.
- You gotta move faster, buddy.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.114
I thought you were faster
than this.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.648
- Cesar: Come on.
- Bowen: I know, I know, I know!

21:56.682 --> 21:58.184
Gordon:
Stand by.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.686
- Five, four, three...
- Let's go. Come on.

22:00.719 --> 22:03.055
- ...two, one, switch.
- Go, go, go.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.991
- Gordon: Let's go.
- All right, Bowen, come on.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.225
- You're not communicating
with me anymore.
- Okay.

22:06.258 --> 22:07.426
- What you wanna do?
- Hey. Yes.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.963
Come on, Bowen, talk to me.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.965
I don't know, like--
like--

22:12.999 --> 22:16.135
Let's go.
Dear, oh, dear.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.170
- What are we doing?
Talk to each other.
- Yeah, I did.

22:18.204 --> 22:19.972
Big deep breath and have
a bit more confidence
in what you're doing.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.008
Okay. Okay, okay.

22:22.041 --> 22:24.376
- And get it together.
- Yes, I got it.

22:24.410 --> 22:28.214
- Cesar, brush a little bit
olive oil.
- Yeah, I got you, Bowen.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.682
- I'm gonna get the sauce done,
all right?
- Perfect, yeah, awesome.

22:30.716 --> 22:32.318
- That garlic's gonna burn.
- Yeah.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.519
The pairing
sticking out tonight,

22:33.552 --> 22:34.653
which I think would be
a disaster,

22:34.686 --> 22:36.855
the pairing
of Taylor and Julia.

22:36.889 --> 22:38.724
What, um,
what do you think for this?

22:38.757 --> 22:41.360
- Have you made those
spinach pies before?
- No.

22:41.393 --> 22:45.197
Gerron has your apron on, Joe.
So why do you think
he made those choices?

22:45.231 --> 22:47.366
Joe: Julia is very strong,
more experienced.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.902
- I think Julia's gonna command,
Taylor's gonna follow...
- No.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.671
- ...and he did a really,
really nice move there.
- I disagree.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.908
I think he believes that Taylor
is gonna be dead weight,

22:55.942 --> 22:58.344
and she's gonna bring down
Julia big time.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.878
If you're not sure about it
then do something else.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.380
- You can do the sauce.
- Okay.

23:01.413 --> 23:04.550
Two minutes remaining
till the next switch.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.286
- Come on, guys.
- What do you guys think
about Ashley and Farhan?

23:07.319 --> 23:09.755
- Have you tasted that yet?
Okay, okay.
- Yeah, I did. It's good.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.958
Gordon:
Listen, there's a marriage
made in heaven,

23:11.991 --> 23:13.892
because those two are
powerhouses.

23:13.926 --> 23:16.428
- Absolutely.
- Pack it in, pack it in. Good.

23:16.462 --> 23:17.763
I know you know
what you're doing.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.098
The vulnerable team
for me tonight

23:19.131 --> 23:20.732
is gonna be Samantha
and Shanika,

23:20.766 --> 23:21.934
because I don't think
they're compatible.

23:21.968 --> 23:23.635
Move it a little bit faster,
Samantha.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.737
You're moving slow, baby.
You're moving too slow.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.639
I'm going as fast
as I can, Shanika.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.075
Joe:
Shanika can be headstrong.

23:29.108 --> 23:30.309
I think Samantha is kinda quiet.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.910
How are they gonna communicate?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.279
Add your pine nuts
so that you don't forget.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.281
Okay? Sam? Sam?

23:35.314 --> 23:36.815
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

23:36.848 --> 23:38.417
Joe:
30 seconds till the switch,
guys.

23:38.450 --> 23:40.786
- 30 seconds.
- All right, Bowen.

23:40.819 --> 23:42.154
I want you to throw the
spanakopitas in the oven, okay?

23:42.188 --> 23:43.322
Okay, okay.

23:43.355 --> 23:45.424
We have to make
that cucumber sauce.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.559
- We'll just smash some garlic
in there.
- Are you sure?

23:47.593 --> 23:48.995
- I don't think
there's garlic in it.
- Positive.

23:49.028 --> 23:50.829
Go, go, go, go.
Turn those kabobs.

23:50.862 --> 23:53.265
- All right, heard.
- Get ready.

23:53.299 --> 23:55.667
- Five, four, three...
- What do you want?

23:55.701 --> 23:58.570
- Oh, my God.
- ...two, one, switch.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.606
- Cesar.
- Get it, girl.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.908
- Okay, so that-- okay.
- Gordon: Talk, come on.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.676
You're going with the lamb now?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.178
No, I'm gonna knock out
the spanakopita.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.813
Okay, yeah.
You finish that,

24:07.846 --> 24:09.581
because I--
I'm not familiar
how to do that,

24:09.615 --> 24:11.984
- or how to fold it.
- Yeah.

24:12.018 --> 24:14.120
Bowen, start cooking.
Get the chicken on first.
There you go.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.654
- Bowen: I know!
- Come on, Bowen.

24:15.687 --> 24:18.024
Don't be scared
of the fire!

24:18.057 --> 24:19.691
You're a cook,
for crying out loud! Come on!

24:19.725 --> 24:21.860
- Bowen: Oh, my God.
- All right, check the hummus.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.997
Work a little bit faster,
Shanika.

24:25.031 --> 24:26.165
- Work a little bit faster.
- I'm moving fast, Sam.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.766
Hurry up, hurry up.

24:27.799 --> 24:29.268
It's easier said than done.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.437
You done put me on like four
different things already.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.505
( sighs )
Are you serious?

24:33.539 --> 24:35.007
- Ashley, keep brushing
on the butter.
- Yeah?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.975
There you go, girl.
There you go, girl.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.445
- Keep going. Yes, Chef.
How's it going?
- All right, so, Farhan.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.147
You've got my apron on,

24:41.180 --> 24:42.548
so talk to me a little bit
about who's doing what.

24:42.581 --> 24:44.016
I got the spinach started,

24:44.050 --> 24:45.884
and I marinated the chicken
and the lamb.

24:45.917 --> 24:48.620
So Ashley's job right now is
to get the spanakopita done.

24:48.654 --> 24:50.522
So you laid
the foundation down,

24:50.556 --> 24:52.658
but you want her
to make the spanakopita
with the spinach hot?

24:52.691 --> 24:54.660
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're gonna
have to let it cool down.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.529
- Okay, no problem.
- Obviously you guys are
communicating well.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.398
Make sure all that filling
is nice and tight,

24:59.431 --> 25:00.799
and it should not burst.
All right?

25:00.832 --> 25:02.401
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Chef.

25:02.434 --> 25:04.370
Joe:
Let's go, guys.
Come on, speed it up.

25:04.403 --> 25:05.671
Gordon:
We've got 12 minutes remaining.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.974
Two minutes
until the next switch.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.710
Okay, there's parsley
and then all those spices.

25:11.743 --> 25:13.979
- Taylor, let me get these
folded 'cause--
- I know.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.547
- I'm just trying to talk
to you. Sorry.
- Yeah.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.516
Quickly, quickly.
Don't be--

25:17.549 --> 25:19.551
Have you never cooked
over a ( bleep ) grill?

25:19.585 --> 25:20.919
I'm doing it.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.388
I don't know
how we're gonna do this.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.724
What do we need now?
Sam?

25:25.757 --> 25:27.059
Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go.

25:27.093 --> 25:28.394
Flip the chicken.
Perfect.

25:28.427 --> 25:30.496
Okay, hurry.
And make 'em kinda smaller.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.398
Joe:
Okay, guys, how's it going?
Where do we stand?

25:32.431 --> 25:34.566
We just gotta get the lamb on,
that's number one right now.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.934
- That's way too much.
Way too much.
- You haven't even formed those?

25:35.967 --> 25:37.669
You haven't started cooking
anything yet?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.238
Get 'em on the grill
so they have time to cook.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.039
- Time's running out.
- Okay, okay, okay.

25:41.073 --> 25:42.508
I'm really concerned
about this.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.809
Good luck.

25:45.311 --> 25:50.182
Five, four, three,
two, one, switch!

25:50.216 --> 25:52.284
- Gordon: Let's go!
- Go, go, go.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.120
Get the sauces ready
so I can go ahead and plate.

25:54.153 --> 25:56.355
Gordon:
You have to multitask, guys.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.689
Those are seasoned, okay?

25:57.723 --> 25:59.057
- Yep, heard. With the za'atar.
- Yeah.

25:59.091 --> 26:00.926
Awesome. I like
the way you work!

26:00.959 --> 26:02.728
Keep moving,
keep moving.

26:02.761 --> 26:05.264
Ashley and Farhan, they seem
to be working great together.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.032
No one's really arguing
with one another.

26:07.065 --> 26:09.135
- You gotta finish this out,
all right?
- Okay.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.303
Get these off the grill
and get 'em in the oven.

26:11.337 --> 26:12.971
Okay. I need to know
what to do.

26:13.004 --> 26:14.140
You're fine.
Just breathe,
just breathe.

26:14.173 --> 26:16.575
- Get the falafel done.
- Okay.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.810
- And you gotta get those
pita chips in.
- Seriously?

26:18.844 --> 26:20.379
- Do that.
- You're telling me
a million things.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.148
- Taylor's all over the place.
- Yeah.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.316
- Taylor's in a spin.
- Julia: Is it browning or no?

26:24.350 --> 26:26.752
They're so burnt.

26:26.785 --> 26:28.154
- They all burned?
- Oh, my God.

26:28.187 --> 26:29.955
- What do I do?
- Get 'em out.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.890
Aarón:
Taylor is not bringing
anything to this team.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.226
She's falling under the
pressure, which is unfortunate.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.128
- ( groans )
- I'm sorry.

26:36.162 --> 26:37.496
- I'm trying, I'm trying.
- Come on.

26:37.529 --> 26:40.098
This is gonna be
the death of me.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.367
Cesar, check the kabob.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.470
- Cesar.
- We're doing good, Bowen.

26:44.503 --> 26:46.605
- Don't trip on it.
- Cesar doesn't take direction.

26:46.638 --> 26:48.774
More importantly,
they're not talking
to each other.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.609
- Cesar. Yes.
- Joe: That's a problem.

26:50.642 --> 26:53.111
- Cesar, take it off.
- But I gotta say,

26:53.145 --> 26:55.947
they're playing
to each other's strengths,
they're ahead of the game.

26:55.981 --> 26:58.517
- They could be victorious
tonight.
- 25 seconds to go

26:58.550 --> 27:01.153
- until the last switch.
- Shanika: Check the meat
in the oven.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.121
If it's done,
you can pull it out.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.191
I don't know if that chicken
is done, but that lamb
should be okay.

27:05.224 --> 27:07.025
Gordon:
Last switch coming up, guys.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.528
- All right, is it cooked?
- No. Almost, almost.

27:09.561 --> 27:11.330
All right,
so take the lambs out.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.031
It'll cook-- no, it'll cook
with the dressing there.

27:13.064 --> 27:14.800
Okay. Put it in there.
Put it back in the oven.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.436
No, it'll rest and it'll cook,
come to temp.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.606
- All right, Sam.
- Five, four, three,

27:20.639 --> 27:22.974
- two, one, switch!
- Switch!

27:23.008 --> 27:24.276
- And switch!
- Let's go.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.511
- Go, go, go, go.
- Let's go!

27:25.544 --> 27:27.012
This is it!
This is it!

27:27.045 --> 27:28.447
- What do you want me to do?
- Start plating.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.681
Come on, this is the last
five minutes.

27:29.715 --> 27:31.317
Come on, come on,
come on!

27:31.350 --> 27:33.185
Flip it over.
Feel the hummus.

27:33.219 --> 27:35.554
- Gordon: Shanika.
You need to plate.
- Yes, Chef.

27:35.587 --> 27:36.955
- You need to plate.
- Don't give up.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.057
- Look at me. She is behind.
- Yeah.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.393
- You need to help her. Come on.
- I will, I will.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.395
- Let's go.
- Hummus goes
in this bowl, right?

27:43.429 --> 27:46.498
- Yep.
- This is your last chance,
so make it count.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.066
All right, come on.
We gotta go quickly.
There you go.

27:48.099 --> 27:49.735
We don't even have
the onion ready.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.537
- It's okay, it's okay.
- It is not okay.

27:51.570 --> 27:53.472
Make sure those plates
are perfect.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.640
- Make sure everything's
perfect.
- Heard, heard, heard.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.242
Oh, my God,
I need the spanakopita.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.143
- There's a little bit--
Okay, hurry.
- Come on.

27:58.176 --> 27:59.911
Gordon:
Two and a half minutes to go.

27:59.945 --> 28:02.147
- Joe: Let's go, guys. Come on!
- Cesar: Stir it, get a whisk.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.482
Get a whisk and stir--

28:03.515 --> 28:05.317
Get a whisk!
Listen to me!

28:05.351 --> 28:07.553
Get what we have on the board!
Get what we have on the board!

28:07.586 --> 28:09.655
- Sam.
- Shanika, I'm stressed out!

28:09.688 --> 28:11.857
- Let's go!
- I am, too,
but you didn't do ( bleep ).

28:11.890 --> 28:14.025
Get that done.
Come on, red pepper sauce
underneath the chicken.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.394
- Heard, heard, heard.
- Let's go, come on.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.896
- 60 seconds to go!
- Joe: One minute left!

28:17.929 --> 28:20.031
- The hummus is over there.
- Joe: Come on, let's go!

28:20.065 --> 28:22.368
- Julia, the hummus is
in the corner over there.
- Julia: I know!

28:22.401 --> 28:23.835
I don't know
if that chicken is done, Sam.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.371
Then only put the two
small ones on there.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.506
Get it on the plate.
This is your last chance.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.441
- Gordon: 30 seconds to go.
- Just 30 seconds.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.343
One more.
Grab the prettiest one.

28:31.377 --> 28:34.380
Put a little bit of lemon
and the hummus on top.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.047
- Okay, that's not gonna happen.
- Come on, come on, come on.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.083
- Aarón: Come on, Shanika!
- Here we go!

28:38.116 --> 28:40.386
- Ten, nine, eight...
- Get it on the plate!
It's fine.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.588
- Get it on the plate-- it's not
( bleep ), it's yogurt.
- ...seven, six,

28:42.621 --> 28:45.391
- five, four, three...
- Ashley, come on. Let's go.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.859
...two, one, and stop!

28:47.893 --> 28:49.227
Aarón:
Hands in the air.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.936
Joe:
It's time to taste
your Mediterranean platters.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.239
Aarón:
First up, Bowen and Cesar.

29:01.273 --> 29:03.709
Bowen:
The tag team challenge--
oh, my God.

29:03.742 --> 29:06.312
Me and Cesar is not go along.

29:06.345 --> 29:09.415
He is so controlling
and kind of cocky.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.116
But I'm really confident

29:11.149 --> 29:14.620
because everything
on the platter, it looks good.

29:14.653 --> 29:17.556
So, tonight, Gordon,
I'm gonna make you proud.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.925
Well, you know
it was evident

29:19.958 --> 29:21.460
that you guys had
your struggles.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.396
Visually,
it's delivering.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.231
This is just stunning.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.067
Now, who was in charge
of the spanakopita?

29:29.100 --> 29:30.736
Bowen cooked the spinach
and then I assembled
everything else.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.672
Did you feel confident, Bowen,
with him rolling them?

29:33.705 --> 29:35.741
Yes, I trust him.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.243
- Even if I don't like him.
- ( laughs )

29:38.276 --> 29:40.245
- Even after this,
you don't like me?
- No, because, like,

29:40.278 --> 29:42.614
he has his opinion,
I have my opinion.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.516
- Sometimes like--
- That's called being human.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.251
I just do not like you.
That's--

29:46.284 --> 29:47.486
that--
that is the reason.

29:47.519 --> 29:49.154
Bowen, Cesar, look,

29:49.187 --> 29:51.323
it's like same thing
with Chef Gordon and Joe.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.192
They might disagree, but they're
here for the common goal.

29:54.225 --> 29:55.994
It's called being
professional, right?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.163
- Yes.
- So, this spanakopita,
I love it.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.866
I love it,
I think you did
a great job.

30:00.899 --> 30:03.635
I think the spinach
is kind of really creamy
and a little bit sort of--

30:03.669 --> 30:06.204
it had that sulfuric taste
to it, which I like.

30:06.237 --> 30:09.975
- Thank you.
- Talk to me about the marinade
on the chicken kabob.

30:10.008 --> 30:12.143
So it's salt, pepper,
ground coriander,

30:12.177 --> 30:13.612
lemon juice, olive oil.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.280
The chicken's cooked
through perfectly.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.383
You were very aggressive
with the coriander,

30:17.416 --> 30:19.651
- so that's coming through,
which is nice.
- Thank you, Chef.

30:19.685 --> 30:22.821
- Talk to me about the lamb.
- I seasoned the lamb.

30:22.854 --> 30:25.624
Salt and pepper, coriander
seeds, and then cumin.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.058
The lamb is delicious.

30:27.092 --> 30:29.294
Really great grill marks,
I like that.

30:29.327 --> 30:30.629
Who did you have on the hummus?

30:30.662 --> 30:31.630
Cesar: I made
the hummus, Chef,

30:31.663 --> 30:33.198
with lemon juice,
olive oil,

30:33.231 --> 30:34.833
- salt, pepper.
- Your hummus is great.

30:34.866 --> 30:37.636
Great job of adding
the olive oil

30:37.669 --> 30:40.171
and making it very sort
of unctuous and creamy.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.907
That's what you want.
And then that falafel,

30:41.940 --> 30:43.675
that is textbook.

30:43.709 --> 30:45.977
Guys, with a platter
this well executed,

30:46.011 --> 30:49.247
it's gonna be a hard proposition
for one of you guys
to go home tonight.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.150
Well done.
You did us proud.

30:52.183 --> 30:54.886
Gerron, I know you wanted me
home tonight,

30:54.920 --> 30:56.688
but, sadly,
you made the wrong call.

30:56.722 --> 30:58.657
Your prediction
didn't plan out.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.059
Bowen, I love you, man.

31:01.092 --> 31:02.494
Let's just hug it out.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.697
- Calm down.
- I don't like you.

31:05.731 --> 31:09.968
Gordon:
Right, next up,
Julia and Taylor.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.938
I took the lead in the team.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.340
Taylor, she was
second-guessing herself,

31:15.373 --> 31:18.076
and I was doing my best
to pick up the slack.

31:18.109 --> 31:19.878
So I'm really hoping

31:19.911 --> 31:21.847
that what we have on the
platter is gonna be enough

31:21.880 --> 31:23.882
to keep us in this competition.

31:23.915 --> 31:26.251
Ladies.

31:26.284 --> 31:28.053
You know and I know

31:28.086 --> 31:30.422
that that does not
look appetizing.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.058
And what I've just witnessed
in the last 60 minutes

31:33.091 --> 31:34.760
was a freaking disaster,

31:34.793 --> 31:37.062
because you panicked, Taylor.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.930
- Why?
- I mean, I panicked
for a little bit,

31:38.964 --> 31:42.300
but I felt like I was just
excited in it--

31:42.333 --> 31:43.569
in the whole thing.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.236
Excited? For this?

31:45.270 --> 31:47.906
I mean, look at
the color of those.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.308
It's gray.
That is not a kofta.

31:50.341 --> 31:51.743
Who cooked these?

31:51.777 --> 31:53.278
I put 'em on the grill.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.080
It's like something
my bulldog left

31:55.113 --> 31:57.449
under the sofa discreetly.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.217
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm not laughing,
Taylor,

31:59.250 --> 32:01.453
because somebody's leaving.

32:03.421 --> 32:05.256
What happened here?
I mean, seriously.

32:05.290 --> 32:07.793
What are those?
Who cooked that?

32:07.826 --> 32:10.562
- Taylor: I fried 'em.
- Please, have a dog biscuit.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.964
Have a dog biscuit.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.602
- It's very nutty.
- Nutty.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.670
It's dry.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.171
Who cooked the chicken?

32:20.205 --> 32:23.041
I did, Chef.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.013
There's no flavor
in there whatsoever.

32:28.046 --> 32:30.448
- Who made these?
- I did.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.452
It actually tastes better
than it looks,

32:34.486 --> 32:36.354
but there's just way too much
phyllo paste,

32:36.387 --> 32:38.990
which just causes it
to be super dry.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.793
Nice crispy pita bread.

32:41.827 --> 32:43.294
Mm-hmm. Delicious.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.330
However, I'm disappointed.

32:49.067 --> 32:50.536
Taylor:
I'm just so embarrassed.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.704
I just feel disappointed
in myself.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.507
Our team as a whole, we could've
worked better together,

32:55.541 --> 32:59.277
and I let my nerves and
the pressure just get to me.

32:59.310 --> 33:02.147
It's just a terrible feeling
letting Gordon down.

33:02.180 --> 33:05.016
We're gonna be fine.
Don't worry.

33:05.050 --> 33:09.988
Next up, Ashley and Farhan.

33:10.021 --> 33:11.623
Ashley and I
worked great together.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.959
I think we really did
a good job communicating,

33:13.992 --> 33:16.194
getting everything
on the plate.

33:16.227 --> 33:18.329
The only thing that I'm really
disappointed about
is the falafel.

33:18.363 --> 33:21.299
So I'm really hoping, you know,
it's cooked properly,

33:21.332 --> 33:23.234
and our flavors are there.

33:23.268 --> 33:26.071
So, certainly,
appearance-wise
it's the most colorful,

33:26.104 --> 33:28.306
and aesthetically pleasing.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.408
I can tell just by looking at
it that it's properly cooked,

33:30.441 --> 33:33.712
except here, the falafel's--

33:33.745 --> 33:35.080
this is like sand
on the beach.

33:35.113 --> 33:37.048
Yeah, no, it's not--
it's not good.

33:37.082 --> 33:38.516
The issue we had was
when we were frying them,

33:38.550 --> 33:39.885
they kept breaking apart.

33:44.022 --> 33:46.524
It's a little bit drier,
but it's good.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.226
It has incredible
depth of flavor.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.228
Spanakopita looks really nice.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.831
They're like giant size.
Who capped in that filling?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.833
Honestly,
it was a little teamwork.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.868
I started it,
Ashley finished it up.

33:56.902 --> 33:59.738
I think the flavor in there
encapsulates what I saw
from you two,

33:59.771 --> 34:03.208
was mutual respect,
communication, calmness.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.276
- Thank you, Joe.
- Who assembled the chicken?

34:05.310 --> 34:08.747
He marinated the chicken,
I finished the assembly
and got it on the grill.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.348
It's nice and moist,
it's cooked properly,

34:10.381 --> 34:12.718
and the lamb,
well-seasoned.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.085
Really, really good.

34:14.119 --> 34:16.187
And here, pita
and the hummus--

34:16.221 --> 34:18.223
This looks really,
like, spot-on, like--

34:18.256 --> 34:20.358
like you would see
in a Mediterranean
restaurant.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.861
It's missing a little bit
of salt, but it's good.

34:22.894 --> 34:24.896
Too bad you had some
technical errors,

34:24.930 --> 34:27.933
but the platter speaks
to a unified effort.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.101
And you guys were a pretty
stellar example

34:30.135 --> 34:32.237
of what a tag team challenge
should look like.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.073
- Thank you.
- You created a very nice
team here, Gerron.

34:35.106 --> 34:36.808
- Agreed.
- Good job, guys. Thank you.

34:36.842 --> 34:38.243
- Thank you guys so much.
- Thanks, Joe.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.484
Last up, Shanika and Samantha.

34:46.517 --> 34:48.286
Shanika:
I'm pissed off.

34:48.319 --> 34:51.056
We did not work together as
a team the way we should have,

34:51.089 --> 34:54.092
and I'm embarrassed
by this platter.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.094
I do not wanna present it
to the judges.

34:56.127 --> 34:58.396
Right now I just wanna ask
if we can just pass.

34:58.429 --> 35:01.833
Shanika, Samantha.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.736
Both of you disintegrated
tonight. Why?

35:04.770 --> 35:06.304
It was lack
of communication.

35:06.337 --> 35:08.306
Once I did get on to the things
I needed to get on,

35:08.339 --> 35:10.508
- it was too much on my plate.
- So you were sandbagged?

35:10.541 --> 35:13.111
- Basically.
- I don't agree

35:13.144 --> 35:15.246
that Shanika was the only one
doing everything.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.248
I folded the spanakopita.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.084
Most of the falafel
that are on the plate

35:19.117 --> 35:20.752
are the ones that I dropped
in the fryer,

35:20.786 --> 35:24.255
so I don't see
where I didn't participate.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.658
I've had everyone in this whole
competition telling me

35:26.692 --> 35:28.293
that because I'm young
I'm not good enough,

35:28.326 --> 35:31.362
and then having my teammate
on the side telling me

35:31.396 --> 35:33.932
- I was working too slow and--
- Calm down.

35:33.965 --> 35:36.768
I was coaching you, telling you
just to move a little faster.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.770
- In a very negative way, which
obviously wasn't working.
- I did not.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.806
- Well, you could've said it...
- I was raising my voice...

35:40.839 --> 35:42.540
- ...in a different way.
- ...because you said
you couldn't hear me.

35:42.573 --> 35:47.612
Let's get back to the
Mediterranean platter, please.

35:47.645 --> 35:49.848
- Who cooked the lamb?
- Samantha: I put 'em
on the grill

35:49.881 --> 35:51.482
and she finished them
in the oven.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.986
It's a tad overcooked,

35:55.020 --> 35:56.888
but seasoning is on point,
let's get that right.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.357
Spanakopita.

36:00.658 --> 36:03.061
It needs a touch
more feta.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.662
- And who cooked the chicken?
- She took it out of the oven

36:04.696 --> 36:07.799
- and I took it off and--
- I did the marinade.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.600
Look, it's pink.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.171
And I've just eaten a chunk.

36:13.204 --> 36:15.406
I did not wanna put
that chicken on this platter.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.542
- The smallest piece
we assumed were done.
- That's why--

36:17.575 --> 36:19.978
That's why I told you
we needed to cut the chicken
pieces smaller.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.748
Okay, but in the end,
you said you don't care,
put it on the plate.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.082
I said put the two
small ones on.

36:24.115 --> 36:25.516
- Okay, Sam.
- Gordon: Oh, boy.

36:25.550 --> 36:28.353
What was going
across the last 60 minutes

36:28.386 --> 36:29.520
and you're still bitching.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.089
Yes, we are.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.824
America's next MasterChef
is thick-skinned,

36:32.858 --> 36:34.525
strong, confident.

36:34.559 --> 36:35.827
They don't disintegrate.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.495
I tried.

36:37.528 --> 36:39.564
I was picking up on the slack
of a lot of the things--

36:39.597 --> 36:41.532
I'm done. Thank you.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.009
That was a tough
elimination challenge.

36:51.042 --> 36:55.280
I'd like all four teams to come
down to the front, please.
Let's go.

36:55.313 --> 36:57.682
Gerron:
When I'm looking at the
performance of everyone today,

36:57.715 --> 37:00.051
I'm feeling pretty confident
about my strategy.

37:00.085 --> 37:02.587
Everything that I did tonight
was successful.

37:02.620 --> 37:05.924
The communication was off
and it was a complete disaster.

37:05.957 --> 37:07.358
A team will go down.

37:07.392 --> 37:10.461
Tonight, one team
during the cook excelled

37:10.495 --> 37:12.363
in this kitchen this evening,

37:12.397 --> 37:16.234
which means they are both safe
from elimination.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.508
Cesar and Bowen.

37:25.977 --> 37:27.779
You both are safe.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.448
Get yourself up there on that
balcony next to Gerron, please.

37:30.481 --> 37:32.050
- Thank you.
- Good job.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.052
Best team of the night.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.821
How do you like that, Gerron?

37:35.854 --> 37:37.889
You wanted me out,
but I'm still here.

37:37.923 --> 37:41.559
I believe I'm living up
to Chef Aarón's expectations.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.829
So, I wanna win
this whole competition

37:43.862 --> 37:46.331
to make Chef Aarón
even more proud of me.

37:46.364 --> 37:48.499
And there's one more team

37:48.533 --> 37:50.869
that doesn't really need to
worry about elimination tonight.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.306
Farhan and Ashley.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.310
You two guys, up to the safety
of the balcony.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.511
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:04.615 --> 38:08.920
Now it comes down
to you two teams.

38:08.954 --> 38:13.458
Both teams were somewhat
unbalanced and fragmented.

38:13.491 --> 38:17.128
One team fell short.

38:17.162 --> 38:23.068
The final team safe
from elimination is...

38:24.669 --> 38:27.672
...Shanika and Samantha.

38:31.877 --> 38:33.478
Shanika:
I know what we did wrong,

38:33.511 --> 38:35.981
but I will never make
the same mistake twice.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.684
So I am coming
with everything I've got

38:39.717 --> 38:42.320
to win that trophy.

38:42.353 --> 38:47.859
Taylor and Julia,
we felt it lacked direction.

38:47.893 --> 38:49.527
It lacked ownership.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.897
And then some
of the fundamental flaws

38:51.930 --> 38:53.831
that were across that platter
was just unacceptable

38:53.865 --> 38:57.002
when you are both
in the top nine.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.740
Taylor...

39:04.876 --> 39:10.315
...your time is done
inside the MasterChef kitchen.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.784
Julia, head up onto the balcony.

39:18.756 --> 39:21.426
Taylor, tonight got
the better of you.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.662
Julia did 85% of the work.

39:24.695 --> 39:28.266
You know, young lady, third time
trying out for this competition,

39:28.299 --> 39:30.335
you've done incredibly well.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.671
Continue that food dream.

39:33.704 --> 39:35.206
How are you feeling?

39:35.240 --> 39:37.208
Just--

39:37.242 --> 39:39.610
Let me just--

39:39.644 --> 39:43.614
Every step of the way has been
so challenging for me.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.451
I just couldn't be more thankful
for the opportunity

39:46.484 --> 39:50.355
and being here and, Chef,
I am so, so grateful

39:50.388 --> 39:51.856
for you to be my mentor
up to this point.

39:51.889 --> 39:53.458
I couldn't be more thankful.

39:54.892 --> 39:56.894
Right, young lady.
Come and say goodbye.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.766
Good luck.
It was a pleasure.

40:01.799 --> 40:03.901
You did great.

40:03.935 --> 40:06.137
Thank you, Chef.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.407
Young lady, please,
place your apron on your bench,

40:09.440 --> 40:10.875
and have a safe trip home.
Thank you.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.910
- Aarón: Great job.
- Gordon: Take care.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.279
Go, Taylor.

40:14.312 --> 40:15.947
Taylor:
I'm really sad to go,

40:15.981 --> 40:20.785
but I'm proud of who is walking
out of the competition,

40:20.818 --> 40:23.721
because I'm a stronger person,

40:23.754 --> 40:24.789
a stronger home cook.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.728
- Gerron: Love you, Taylor.
- Love you, Tay-tay.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.298
I am so much closer

40:33.331 --> 40:34.966
to my culinary dream
to open up a restaurant,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.268
and I am just excited

40:37.302 --> 40:39.037
about what's ahead of me.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.412
( sighs )

40:47.445 --> 40:50.448
Now, we're down to
the final eight home cooks.

40:50.481 --> 40:53.684
Samantha:
With Taylor being eliminated,
Team Gordon,

40:53.718 --> 40:57.155
we have
three aprons and we are
neck and neck with Aarón,

40:57.188 --> 40:58.956
who also has three aprons,

40:58.990 --> 41:00.625
but Joe only has two.

41:00.658 --> 41:02.527
It is getting intense
and I have got to make sure

41:02.560 --> 41:05.696
I am working hard
to represent my mentor.

41:05.730 --> 41:08.133
One word of advice.

41:08.166 --> 41:12.703
If you can't stand the heat
of being in the top eight,

41:12.737 --> 41:14.839
you'll soon be out
of this kitchen.

41:14.872 --> 41:16.374
Good night.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.642
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.744
Good night.

41:22.080 --> 41:24.049
Narrator:
Next time on "MasterChef"...

41:24.082 --> 41:29.154
The Thomas fire ravaged
Ventura County.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.390
Today, you're gonna be cooking
for the amazing men and women

41:32.423 --> 41:34.225
who battled that fire.

41:34.259 --> 41:36.561
...when the top eight serve
America's finest...

41:36.594 --> 41:38.296
Aarón:
These are some of the most
important guests

41:38.329 --> 41:39.564
that we have ever served.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.866
This is a joke.
It looks disgusting.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.334
...things backfire...

41:43.368 --> 41:45.170
You can't expect us
to taste this.

41:45.203 --> 41:47.805
It's still raw.
Get a grip.

41:47.838 --> 41:50.675
I will cook this lunch on my
own and I'll send you four home.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.352
You've just taken a bite
out of MasterChef.
