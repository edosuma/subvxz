Spike is great
Making a jewel cake

00:22.400 --> 00:24.049
Me, that's who.

00:24.200 --> 00:26.400
Been saving up my gems
So fine

00:26.550 --> 00:28.600
For a cake
That is divine

00:30.100 --> 00:32.200
Who are you &quot;hooing&quot; at?

00:33.740 --> 00:35.830
I know. They're delicious.

00:38.660 --> 00:41.910
Now you see them,
now you don't.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.430
This is how you make
A jewel cake

00:47.580 --> 00:49.790
Stir in some gems
And then you bake

00:51.680 --> 00:54.910
Gonna eat, eat, eat it up
Gonna--

00:55.670 --> 00:57.590
What happened
to all my jewels?!

01:02.100 --> 01:04.450
I had a bowl full of them here
and now I don't!

01:04.599 --> 01:07.169
Which means,
somebody took them!

01:09.660 --> 01:12.000
Who? That's what I'm asking.
Who?

01:12.150 --> 01:13.970
Who took my jewels?!

01:15.850 --> 01:18.479
Oh, I'm who.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.929
This cake was gonna be
so good.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.120
Why?

01:22.770 --> 01:24.149
Why?

01:30.860 --> 01:33.524
Whyyyyyyyyy??!

01:37.040 --> 01:42.040

02:12.880 --> 02:15.380
I have no jewels

02:15.530 --> 02:17.420
I have no cake

02:17.570 --> 02:21.470
I'm a sad little dragon
With nothing to--

02:22.660 --> 02:24.430
...Is it?

02:25.499 --> 02:29.230
Oh! Oh goodness, I hope
I'm not interrupting anything.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.560
Well, I do have this cake
to not bake.

02:33.080 --> 02:35.750
Oh, sorry. It's a bad time.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.690
Inside joke, talk to me.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.900
It's just that Princess Cadence
needs us to do a great job

02:41.050 --> 02:42.650
welcoming the head
of the Equestria games

02:42.800 --> 02:44.120
when she visits
the Crystal Empire tomorrow.

02:44.270 --> 02:45.800
Oh, I know all about that.

02:45.950 --> 02:48.290
As if I wouldn't be any help
at welcoming.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.390
Oh, I don't know
what I was thinking!

02:50.540 --> 02:53.109
Of course, you might be upset
for not being invited,

02:53.260 --> 02:55.910
and here I am coming to ask you
for a favor.

02:56.060 --> 02:58.540
You were probably
going to say no, anyway.

02:58.690 --> 03:01.350
All I had to offer you in exchange
was one little jewel.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.010
What was that?

03:05.320 --> 03:07.418
All I have is this jewel.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.980
That's a really big one.

03:13.740 --> 03:18.270
A really big, juicy,
perfect for a cake-topper jewel.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.280
Does this mean you'll do it?

03:20.430 --> 03:22.100
Yeah, sure.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.200
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

03:24.350 --> 03:26.250
So while I'm gone,
you'll take care of Angel,

03:26.400 --> 03:29.020
and tomorrow is Tuesday,
which is his tail fluffing day.

03:29.170 --> 03:31.750
And it's really important
for him to look good.

03:31.900 --> 03:34.350
Wait, what? You want me
to take care of him?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.610
Oh, well, yes.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.630
But if it's too much
trouble,

03:42.780 --> 03:44.760
I can always see
if there's somepony else.

03:46.900 --> 03:49.760
We already agreed on the
whole jewel thing, so I'll just--

03:49.910 --> 03:51.810
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

03:51.950 --> 03:54.609
Angel, aren't you
just so excited?

03:58.540 --> 03:59.900
See you tomorrow.

04:03.300 --> 04:06.370
You know, she's not
the only pony with a pet

04:06.520 --> 04:09.000
that might need
some watching.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.700
All I'm saying is if Fluttershy thought
that her beloved little friend

04:14.850 --> 04:17.700
shouldn't be left alone while
you're busy in the Crystal Empire,

04:17.850 --> 04:20.220
then maybe that's just
something to think about.

04:22.490 --> 04:24.810
Tank's not some fuzzy
little bunny.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.810
He can take care of himself.

04:32.050 --> 04:35.410
He's a strong, fearless
and totally together pet.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.380
All right, you can watch him.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.320
But only because, uh...

04:59.470 --> 05:01.380
Tank's got a strict
flying regimen

05:01.530 --> 05:04.789
and someone needs to make sure
that he doesn't slack off while I'm gone.

05:10.970 --> 05:14.600
You know, the two of us
are very diligent.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.200
Okay, whatever.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.400
Yes, yes. And more importantly,
as for Opal,

05:18.550 --> 05:20.500
she likes to eat every
36 and a half minutes.

05:20.650 --> 05:22.289
You groom her with
her silken brush, head to toe.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.500
And don't forget to pooch
her pillow out in the middle,

05:24.650 --> 05:25.609
that's where she likes it.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.099
And the temperature in the room
should always be exactly 81.4 degrees.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.780
That's the only way
she can get to sleep.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.430
So thanks for your help
and good luck to you.

05:40.220 --> 05:45.000
I think the dragon was expecting
a little something for his efforts.

05:49.140 --> 05:53.430
Almost as beautiful
as the pony who gave it to me.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.690
Shouldn't you be critter-proofing
the library or something?

05:55.840 --> 05:57.130
Tank has a tendency to--

06:01.410 --> 06:04.860
Critter-proofing.
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.890
Three down, three to go.

06:08.390 --> 06:09.570
What's that you said, Gummy?

06:12.170 --> 06:14.900
Well, you're just gonna have
to ask Pinkie Pie about that one.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.350
Ask me! Ask me!

06:16.500 --> 06:18.170
Go ahead, ask her.

06:21.220 --> 06:23.710
Of course,
you can have another cupcake!

06:29.600 --> 06:31.430
Yeah. Why didn't you say so?

06:33.180 --> 06:35.220
I'll get you a bigger pond
immediately.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.179
I think what Gummy's
trying to say is--

06:38.330 --> 06:40.010
He's always wanted a pair
of riding pants?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.940
His toenails need
a new coat of shellack?

06:42.090 --> 06:43.849
He wants to floss twice a day
instead of just once?

06:44.530 --> 06:49.030
I think what Gummy is trying to say
is that he'd like a little Spike time.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.440
Who wouldn't?
Spike time is the best.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.540
Alas, it doesn't come cheap.

06:57.070 --> 07:00.159
All I'm saying is that you might
wanna think about a helmet.

07:00.310 --> 07:04.750
You only wanna get hit in the head
by a flying turtle... once.

07:04.900 --> 07:09.390
A thousand plus carats
of pure deliciousness.

07:12.430 --> 07:15.460
Looks like you got a regular
pet day care in here, Spike.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.500
You'll still be able to get
some good playtime

07:17.650 --> 07:19.510
with Winona like you said,
though, won't you?

07:19.660 --> 07:22.440
She tends to get a little wild
if she doesn't get her exercise.

07:22.590 --> 07:24.349
Exercise, sure, of course.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.210
I don't remember seeing
critters on the invite list.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.140
That's because we're leaving
them here with Spike.

07:30.290 --> 07:32.480
He's gonna do a little
critter sitting for us.

07:32.630 --> 07:33.870
Oh, really?

07:38.650 --> 07:42.750
So sorry I'm late.
Silly bunny had hidden his brush.

07:42.900 --> 07:44.380
Be sure you get plenty
on his tail

07:44.530 --> 07:46.380
or it won't get as poofy
as he likes it.

07:46.530 --> 07:48.849
Come on, girls,
or we're gonna miss the train.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.100
One more for the road.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.800
Oh, you little puppy,
come on here.

07:53.950 --> 07:55.750
I love you more.

07:55.900 --> 07:57.500
No, I love you more!

07:57.650 --> 07:59.229
I love you more!!

08:02.740 --> 08:05.260
Oh, I promise
it will be okay.

08:05.410 --> 08:07.770
I'll fluff your tail
twice next week.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.960
Three times?

08:11.800 --> 08:15.450
Oh, I know, it's a chilly
81.2 in here.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.900
Spike, take care of this,
would you please?

08:18.050 --> 08:18.900
You got it!

08:19.050 --> 08:23.040
So, what're you thinking about
that hooting little friend of yours?

08:23.190 --> 08:25.350
Suppose you'll want me
to keep an eye on him too.

08:25.500 --> 08:26.800
That would be nice.

08:26.950 --> 08:28.920
You sure you don't already
have your hands full?

08:29.070 --> 08:31.780
Ah. I'll be fine!

08:31.930 --> 08:34.350
But, just between you and me,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.808
I've gotta give priority
to the paying customers.

08:41.640 --> 08:44.220
You're absolutely sure
you can do this?

08:44.320 --> 08:46.550
Of course! Wouldn't have
agreed to it if I couldn't.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.890
Piece of cake.
Speaking of cake,

08:49.040 --> 08:51.480
I've got a little something
I need to attend to.

08:52.060 --> 08:54.609
Yeah, like, keeping an eye
on a house full of critters.

08:55.870 --> 08:58.860
Uh, yeah. That was totally
what I was talking about.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.350
Relax! Go to your welcoming
thing in the Crystal Empire.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.130
Spike's got it all under control.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.700
All right, sidekicks!
Front and center!

09:41.830 --> 09:43.420
There are six of you,

09:43.570 --> 09:46.620
but there's only one
right here in front of me!

09:48.040 --> 09:50.829
Two. And what I say goes!

09:51.310 --> 09:53.630
Spike, the boss of you,
that's who.

09:53.780 --> 09:55.520
One, two, three!

09:57.490 --> 09:59.220
Come on, number four.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.310
One, two, three, four, five.

10:07.950 --> 10:09.850
Who's missing?

10:12.470 --> 10:14.260
Angel.

10:17.690 --> 10:21.630
All I wanted were some jewels.
Big, juicy delicious jewels.

10:21.780 --> 10:24.329
And now what do I have?
A missing rabbit and--

10:28.070 --> 10:31.010
Oh, little fluffy Angel Bunnykins,

10:31.160 --> 10:32.790
you're so cute!

10:32.940 --> 10:36.110
The natural waves in his fluff
are to die for.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.550
Isn't Angel just the cutest thing
you've ever seen?

10:48.810 --> 10:51.089
Look, you don't wanna
be with me.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.110
I'd rather not chase you around
all over the place

10:53.260 --> 10:55.100
when I could be enjoying
some jewel cake.

10:55.250 --> 10:58.200
Watch me solve
both our problems.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.620
You know, I'm supposed to be
watching him,

11:01.770 --> 11:04.800
but you all have just hit it off
so well, that maybe--

11:04.950 --> 11:08.670
Maybe I could let you
take care of him instead.

11:08.820 --> 11:13.140
We would, but we've got some major
Crusaders business planned for today.

11:13.360 --> 11:17.510
Major. We're getting our
skydiving Cutie Marks today!

11:19.010 --> 11:22.200
Well, I suppose
if you've got other plans...

11:22.350 --> 11:24.550
It's just--
You're so good with him.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.980
Like &quot;get a Cutie Mark
for bunny-sitting&quot; good.

11:27.500 --> 11:29.900
A bunny-sitting Cutie Mark.

11:30.050 --> 11:32.793
That would be adorable!

11:33.160 --> 11:34.930
He does seem to like us.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.650
And we hadn't exactly
figured out

11:36.800 --> 11:39.560
how we're going to pull off
this whole skydiving thing.

11:39.710 --> 11:40.650
You know what?

11:40.800 --> 11:44.160
As hard as it's gonna be for me
to part with these little guys,

11:44.310 --> 11:47.069
I think you should probably
just take all of them.

11:47.220 --> 11:50.350
If you ask me, the more critters
you take care of,

11:50.500 --> 11:54.180
the more chances you have of getting
some kind of critter-sitting Cutie Mark.

11:54.330 --> 11:57.380
Am I right?
Or am I right?

11:59.050 --> 12:00.380
Sure.

12:00.530 --> 12:02.060
- Yes!
- But wait.

12:02.210 --> 12:03.610
How are we gonna take good
care of them

12:03.760 --> 12:05.400
without treats
for when they're good?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.349
And we'll need beds
for when their tired!

12:07.500 --> 12:09.090
And toys.
They need toys!

12:09.210 --> 12:10.500
It's an afternoon.

12:10.650 --> 12:13.060
They don't need all that stuff.
They'll be fine!

12:13.210 --> 12:15.300
We need to be able
to buy them some things.

12:15.450 --> 12:18.060
One jewel might be able
to cover it all.

12:18.660 --> 12:21.400
What would I possibly
be doing with jewels?

12:21.550 --> 12:23.400
I happen to know for a fact

12:23.550 --> 12:26.449
that Applejack gave you a gem
to watch Winona.

12:26.450 --> 12:27.710
Which means...

12:28.430 --> 12:31.430
Obviously no one around here
is getting a Cutie Mark

12:31.580 --> 12:34.880
for kindness towards a poor,
hungry little dragon.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.040
Take it or leave it!

12:36.190 --> 12:37.320
We'll take it.

12:40.900 --> 12:44.380
Gonna put in some flour
And add a little sugar

12:44.530 --> 12:46.980
For my five
Delicious jewels

12:47.180 --> 12:50.349
But pink feathers would look
so good with your eyes!

12:52.290 --> 12:54.520
That bird could use
a little color.

12:54.670 --> 12:57.780
Has anyone seen Tank's head?
Where's his head?!

12:58.230 --> 12:59.900
What've you done
to the turtle?!

13:01.120 --> 13:04.360
Oh, he totally forgot
he could do that.

13:06.660 --> 13:10.490
Yeah. So pretty sure
critter-sitting Cutie Marks are out.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.020
And our critter-grooming
Cutie Marks

13:13.170 --> 13:16.000
probably aren't going to appear
any time soon either.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.500
All right,
load them up.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.720
And you can give me back
that jewel I gave you.

13:21.870 --> 13:24.290
Sorry.
We don't have it anymore.

13:24.440 --> 13:25.700
What? Why not?

13:25.850 --> 13:29.350
How do you think we paid
for the industrial-sized pet hair dryer?

13:49.490 --> 13:52.040
Zecora knows just what to do

13:52.190 --> 13:55.200
about all this bad mojo
that's floating around you.

13:55.350 --> 13:59.090
I'm thinking a cage
and a great big lock might be next.

13:59.240 --> 14:03.000
Zecora can take the bad away
if you do just what I say.

14:03.150 --> 14:04.000
Really?

14:04.150 --> 14:05.500
But before I can do my duty,

14:05.650 --> 14:08.390
I'm going to need
some of your booty.

14:14.450 --> 14:15.560
Where are you going?

14:15.710 --> 14:17.600
You think jewels
are what you need,

14:17.750 --> 14:20.860
but there's no worse mojo
than dragon greed.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.599
Almost there.

14:48.630 --> 14:51.180
Just taking good care
of everyone's animals!

14:53.990 --> 14:57.220
What am I gonna have to do
to get this to go away?

15:02.190 --> 15:04.690
Then this is just
between you and me, right?

15:04.840 --> 15:07.120
No other pony
has to hear a word about it?

15:09.140 --> 15:12.240
A word about what now?

15:16.480 --> 15:18.550
This better be important.

15:21.410 --> 15:23.170
All aboard!

15:23.760 --> 15:24.718
Angel!

15:27.700 --> 15:30.130
I can't have all of these
animals on my train.

15:30.280 --> 15:32.510
Not without tickets
and not without chaperones.

15:32.660 --> 15:34.430
All I need is to get
on for one minute,

15:34.580 --> 15:36.510
grab a bunny and get off!
Promise.

15:36.660 --> 15:38.319
A likely story.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.520
No chaperone, no train!

15:44.230 --> 15:46.520
Skydiving Cutie Marks!

15:48.780 --> 15:50.360
Is three ponies enough?

15:54.550 --> 15:58.829
At least I have you two left,
my delectable little treasures.

15:58.980 --> 16:02.660
All aboard
for the Crystal Empire!

16:02.810 --> 16:05.089
Crystal Empire?!

16:05.240 --> 16:07.600
I've always wanted to see
the Crystal Empire!

16:07.740 --> 16:11.470
I wish I were dressed for it,
but still... the Crystal Empire!

16:11.620 --> 16:13.010
We're not really going.

16:13.160 --> 16:15.310
We just needed to get on the train
so I can get that rabbit!

16:15.460 --> 16:17.430
And when I do, we're off!

16:17.580 --> 16:20.610
- What?
- It's not fair!

16:21.600 --> 16:23.090
There he is!

16:24.360 --> 16:27.690
Next stop, the Crystal Empire.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.350
No, no, no, no, no!

16:35.820 --> 16:37.660
So it seems the Crystal Empire

16:37.810 --> 16:40.479
would be really cold,
but I've heard that it's not.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.160
It's as warm as can be!

16:42.310 --> 16:45.530
Do you think the walls are crystal?
Maybe even see-through?

16:45.680 --> 16:47.890
Can you imagine?
See-through walls!

16:59.590 --> 17:02.810
Take it. Just take it!

17:08.180 --> 17:10.780
It's so beautiful.

17:10.930 --> 17:11.930
Well, enjoy it while you can.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.449
We're not getting out of this car
until we're back in Ponyville.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.230
There is no way, no how,

17:17.380 --> 17:19.990
we're coming all the way
to the Crystal Empire

17:19.990 --> 17:21.358
without looking around!

17:21.510 --> 17:23.910
No pony's gonna get past
this dragon!

17:25.510 --> 17:27.829
Don't make me use this!

17:27.980 --> 17:29.800
You wouldn't dare!

17:42.560 --> 17:43.690
Oh no!

17:54.860 --> 17:57.899
Whoa. Just whoa.

17:58.530 --> 18:00.160
I'm in crystal heaven!

18:00.260 --> 18:02.620
Shh. Quiet there!

18:05.870 --> 18:07.070
There's the bunny!

18:07.660 --> 18:10.340
Please, please. Pretty please,
don't go down there.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.510
I'll fluff your tail!

18:17.970 --> 18:21.340
I'll perm, highlight and blow it out
if you'll just stop!

18:21.970 --> 18:25.230
What do you want?
Name it, and it's yours.

18:38.580 --> 18:40.100
Oh, my goodness.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.000
All aboard!

18:44.870 --> 18:46.790
You're coming with me.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.180
We made it!

18:50.330 --> 18:52.199
Without seeing the palace!

18:52.320 --> 18:53.710
I think this car's empty!

18:55.140 --> 18:57.630
They're coming this way.
Everybody down!

18:59.130 --> 19:01.630
There has got to be
a better solution!

19:03.180 --> 19:04.920
Don't sit down,
don't sit down!

19:06.160 --> 19:08.060
My dogs are barking!

19:09.760 --> 19:12.520
Did y'all hear that?
They really are!

19:14.920 --> 19:16.910
Bummer, Spike got
to miss out on all this.

19:17.060 --> 19:18.310
He would have had fun here.

19:18.460 --> 19:22.340
I'm sure he's havinga great time
watching all the critters back at home.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.260
Think he's still got a handle
on things?

19:25.120 --> 19:27.449
If he is staying calm
and collected,

19:27.600 --> 19:30.100
I bet he is doing
a terrific job as a leader.

19:31.970 --> 19:34.750
Go ahead, bunny.
Do your worst.

19:34.900 --> 19:36.250
I deserve it.

19:38.790 --> 19:40.230
I ignored you,

19:40.380 --> 19:42.450
tried to pawn you off
on someone else...

19:42.550 --> 19:46.530
I didn't take these silly things out
or fluff this like I was supposed to.

19:46.680 --> 19:49.240
I wasn't really thinking
about you at all.

19:49.380 --> 19:52.130
Any of you.
Just wanted the jewels.

19:53.280 --> 19:55.629
I hope you'll all forgive me
someday.

19:56.890 --> 19:57.890
You will?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.530
Oh, great.

20:02.680 --> 20:04.750
I'm gonna be the one
who gives us away.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.080
Where did you--?

20:14.230 --> 20:16.340
You all hear that?

20:27.840 --> 20:30.770
I can't wait to scratch
the belly on Winona!

20:30.899 --> 20:32.179
Oh, I miss her.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.270
I can't wait
to see Owlowicious!

20:34.900 --> 20:36.350
Hello!

20:37.880 --> 20:39.570
Thought we'd meet you
at the station!

20:39.699 --> 20:41.830
So we could hear all about
the Crystal Empire

20:41.960 --> 20:44.140
and find out if you brought us
one of the Crystal snow globes

20:44.270 --> 20:45.750
that they sell
at the train station.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.200
How did you know
about the snow globes?

20:51.420 --> 20:52.890
Lucky guess?

20:53.530 --> 20:55.149
I've gotta hand it to you,
Spike.

20:55.290 --> 20:58.170
You did a really good job
of taking care of the animals.

20:59.790 --> 21:02.850
Oh, Spike,
Angel looks perfect!

21:02.980 --> 21:05.630
You did such a good job
fluffing his tail!

21:05.750 --> 21:08.410
Yeah, well,
we're like this now.

21:09.270 --> 21:10.530
You know who.

21:15.410 --> 21:18.060
So, what are you thinking?
Bake them into a jewel pie?

21:18.300 --> 21:21.550
Six-layer gem cake
sounds pretty good!

21:21.670 --> 21:23.300
Yeah, it does.

21:23.720 --> 21:25.770
It really, really does.

21:27.360 --> 21:30.050
Whyyyyyyyy??!
