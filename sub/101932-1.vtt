WEBVTT

11:16.099 --> 11:18.936
You're up. Here. Drink this.

11:20.604 --> 11:22.840
It's water. You need it.

11:35.585 --> 11:37.554
You're lucky to be alive,
you know.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.059
Thank you.

11:51.902 --> 11:54.504
I want you to know that you can
stay here as long as you want.

11:55.437 --> 11:57.540
I want you to feel at home here.

12:07.317 --> 12:09.452
How do you feel?

12:11.187 --> 12:12.856
Tired.

12:14.323 --> 12:17.627
Well, I washed your body

12:17.660 --> 12:21.264
and I did have to get
rid of your clothes.

12:21.298 --> 12:24.335
They were filthy. Ruined.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.308
Can I get a ride somewhere?

12:33.208 --> 12:36.246
A ride?

12:38.347 --> 12:43.353
Well, you can use Papa's cane.
It's in the corner.

12:48.325 --> 12:50.961
I suppose
this will work for now.

16:57.539 --> 17:01.644
Sorry.
I didn't hear you out here.

17:01.677 --> 17:03.446
Hmm.

17:03.479 --> 17:05.281
You scared me.

17:06.781 --> 17:08.451
Did I?

17:24.366 --> 17:26.470
Next time, ask for help.

17:29.271 --> 17:30.874
Shall we?

17:42.451 --> 17:45.655
So, next time ask for help!

22:30.006 --> 22:31.641
You hungry?

23:12.248 --> 23:13.750
What's your name?

23:30.799 --> 23:32.735
What's for lunch?

23:37.673 --> 23:39.308
Your favorite.

24:08.203 --> 24:11.007
Do you enjoy
getting on my nerves?

25:09.230 --> 25:11.701
Can I get you some dessert?

25:11.733 --> 25:14.303
Depends. Is it chicken?

25:30.786 --> 25:32.788
Goodnight.

26:29.111 --> 26:30.947
Can you help me?

26:33.883 --> 26:36.019
Can you help me, please?

27:13.521 --> 27:16.024
Here, let me hold those for you.

27:16.057 --> 27:17.527
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

27:36.578 --> 27:38.248
You a writer?

27:39.480 --> 27:42.117
Umm, yeah, I guess.

27:44.619 --> 27:46.421
What do you write in there?

27:49.525 --> 27:53.096
All kinds of things.

27:55.597 --> 27:58.934
You wanna be a big writer
some day or something?

27:58.968 --> 28:04.073
No.
I mean, I have no plans.

28:16.484 --> 28:17.986
And you?

28:18.019 --> 28:19.189
What?

28:21.257 --> 28:23.459
Umm, what do you want to do?

28:24.425 --> 28:28.831
Nothin'. No plans.

28:33.201 --> 28:35.471
I'm just a piece of shit,
really.

28:58.559 --> 29:00.262
What do you see?

29:03.531 --> 29:06.034
I thought
I told you to stay out!

29:10.405 --> 29:12.375
Look what you did to him.

29:14.676 --> 29:16.478
- You got somethin' to say?
- Uh...

29:16.511 --> 29:18.513
I didn't think so.

29:18.547 --> 29:22.285
Come here! Over here.

29:26.255 --> 29:31.261
I told you to stay out.
Is that understood?

29:34.730 --> 29:38.567
Good. Get out!

30:17.705 --> 30:22.444
My momma used to always tuck me
in like this when I was little.

30:22.478 --> 30:25.281
- Yeah, mine did too.
- Yeah.

30:25.314 --> 30:26.950
Yeah.

30:29.218 --> 30:31.220
Then there was papa.

30:32.688 --> 30:35.658
He always told me
I was a nobody.

30:37.459 --> 30:41.596
Born a nobody,
then we die a nobody.

31:05.354 --> 31:07.590
You get some sleep.

32:07.883 --> 32:10.486
Are you okay?

32:31.373 --> 32:33.342
Are you okay?

32:34.776 --> 32:36.711
You shouldn't be in here.

32:50.659 --> 32:51.560
Get out!

33:21.623 --> 33:25.294
I love my chickens.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.286
Come on! I know.

33:51.787 --> 33:54.923
Coming? Right, let's do it.

33:56.424 --> 33:58.627
Let's go, my chickens.

34:01.596 --> 34:05.500
Alrighty. These are good girls.

34:49.710 --> 34:51.545
So, who are they?

34:55.884 --> 34:57.485
Not here.

35:16.938 --> 35:18.340
What?

35:21.409 --> 35:23.913
Oh, sorry.

35:26.347 --> 35:28.617
- I'll do it.
- Stop it!

35:37.726 --> 35:40.796
I work hard
to keep a decent home for you.

35:40.829 --> 35:42.298
I know.

35:52.574 --> 35:54.976
- I need a chicken prepped.
- What?

35:55.911 --> 35:57.780
We're out of fresh meat.

36:03.918 --> 36:06.655
- Bitch.
- What'd you say?

36:07.789 --> 36:10.359
- Nothing.
- Better not!

37:37.711 --> 37:39.849
What are you doing?

37:46.121 --> 37:50.826
She's already dead. You want to?

37:54.161 --> 37:56.564
Sometimes
the wolves get to them.

38:09.110 --> 38:11.747
I've been growing this flock
for a while now.

38:16.117 --> 38:19.188
They're like little human beings
you know that?

38:23.123 --> 38:26.093
They are.
And they're my closest friends.

38:26.126 --> 38:29.063
- They're chickens.
- They're my companions.

38:33.034 --> 38:37.072
As difficult as this part of the
process might be,

38:39.773 --> 38:45.047
it's the only way I feel I can
give them the respect they deserve.

38:45.079 --> 38:48.150
And it brings me closer
to the food I eat.

38:49.918 --> 38:51.753
Sorry.

38:52.887 --> 38:56.224
In order for one to continue
living, another must die.

38:57.592 --> 38:58.927
Yeah.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.831
Oh! Okay.

42:47.789 --> 42:50.192
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

42:51.126 --> 42:53.862
I... I'm sorry

42:54.762 --> 42:55.831
Get out.

42:57.831 --> 43:02.336
Are you stupid?
Are ya? Get out!

43:02.369 --> 43:05.339
I said get the fuck out!
Get your eggs and fuckin...

43:38.907 --> 43:40.342
Did you fall?

43:41.509 --> 43:43.077
I'm sorry.

43:49.184 --> 43:50.986
Let's get you cleaned up.

46:08.489 --> 46:10.492
Do you think I'm beautiful?

47:36.177 --> 47:39.081
- Any pain?
- No.

47:40.614 --> 47:44.551
Holy shit...
What the fuck? Look at...

47:44.585 --> 47:47.121
Dirty hands cause infection!

48:39.106 --> 48:45.112
Well, we have some fresh
meat in the icebox if you're hungry.

48:51.518 --> 48:53.187
Are you hungry?

50:27.280 --> 50:32.253
Well, I think
I'm going to take a walk.

50:33.387 --> 50:34.756
Care to join me?

50:37.358 --> 50:39.361
I'm only playing with you.

50:43.697 --> 50:46.367
Do you like it
when I play with you?

51:24.271 --> 51:25.672
What is it?

52:43.384 --> 52:45.653
Enjoy your sandwich.

54:15.675 --> 54:18.179
Hey, I'm gonna
say this only once, okay?

54:18.211 --> 54:21.181
You stay the hell out of my shit
or I'll slit your fucking throat.

54:21.215 --> 54:25.420
- You're brave coming at me.
- I'm not afraid of you, you hear me?

54:25.452 --> 54:28.556
- Don't do it again.
- What is with you, man?

54:33.661 --> 54:35.929
- What is this bull shit with you and I?
- What bull shit?

54:35.963 --> 54:38.633
You're in my fucking head.
I can feel it.

54:38.666 --> 54:40.034
I don't know
what you're talking about.

54:40.067 --> 54:42.469
Like I know you somehow.
I know you.

54:43.603 --> 54:45.406
You don't know me.

54:47.740 --> 54:50.177
- I see the way you look at me.
- Fuck you.

54:50.210 --> 54:52.045
You...

55:07.894 --> 55:09.697
No, no, no.

57:55.695 --> 58:01.068
Actually, hold on.
I need to loosen up first.

58:21.954 --> 58:23.056
Come here.

58:24.324 --> 58:25.927
I said come here.

58:27.860 --> 58:30.864
- Where do you hurt?
- All over.

58:35.335 --> 58:37.204
I don't like that.

58:42.208 --> 58:43.944
Why don't you come here?

58:47.748 --> 58:49.983
You know me.

58:50.016 --> 58:52.919
If I ain't sore, then I ain't
done a hard day's work.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.328
Do you think I'm beautiful?

59:35.329 --> 59:36.864
What?

59:36.896 --> 59:38.833
Do you think I'm beautiful?

59:40.534 --> 59:43.070
The most beautiful girl
in the world.

59:43.103 --> 59:45.239
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:46.907 --> 59:48.710
Do you love me?

59:51.110 --> 59:52.512
I really do.

59:52.545 --> 59:55.215
- Really?
- Really.

01:00:05.893 --> 01:00:08.228
You think
you can handle this stranger?

01:00:09.929 --> 01:00:12.866
Hey...

01:00:18.871 --> 01:00:20.307
Damn!

01:00:21.307 --> 01:00:22.876
Typical.

01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:33.855
I win!

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:25.472
I just love this time of day,
don't you?

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:29.242
I would
if it wasn't so fucking hot.

01:01:57.336 --> 01:01:59.072
What happened?

01:02:00.974 --> 01:02:04.644
Stop! Go on. I'll get this.

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:07.882
Do you want to talk about
what happened last night?

01:02:07.914 --> 01:02:09.050
Talk about what?

01:02:12.351 --> 01:02:13.587
Uh...

01:02:14.655 --> 01:02:17.625
Did something happen
I need to know about?

01:02:17.657 --> 01:02:22.462
You deaf?
He asked you a question.

01:04:05.065 --> 01:04:07.768
Let me tell you something.

01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:13.039
Don't you try and run.
It won't be good for you.

01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:24.018
You're beautiful.

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:27.621
Really?

01:04:28.521 --> 01:04:30.290
You're beautiful.

01:05:56.742 --> 01:06:01.414
Fuck. Oh fuck.

01:06:56.402 --> 01:06:58.838
My aunt used to take me
into town

01:06:59.739 --> 01:07:02.309
when she'd go buy food
for the week.

01:07:06.146 --> 01:07:12.286
She's... she's always clutching a
purse in one hand, mine in the other.

01:07:12.318 --> 01:07:14.255
She's as good as it gets.

01:07:17.324 --> 01:07:19.159
One morning...

01:07:20.293 --> 01:07:23.697
instead of walking
our normal route into town,

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.565
she took me a different way.

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:28.235
We started to walk down this
small little gravel backstreet,

01:07:28.268 --> 01:07:31.271
and I started to hear
these noises

01:07:31.304 --> 01:07:34.775
and, heh, and I looked up
and I said, "What's that?"

01:07:34.807 --> 01:07:36.409
and she said, "Chickens."

01:07:40.614 --> 01:07:44.885
I was five years old when my aunt took
me with her and taught me how to...

01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:50.690
how to pick out a chicken
for the first time.

01:07:54.994 --> 01:07:59.266
If they look tired in the eyes,
pass."

01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:08.309
Where is she now?

01:08:10.376 --> 01:08:13.380
She died when I was 16.

01:08:21.054 --> 01:08:22.721
So what about your wife?

01:08:22.756 --> 01:08:24.890
What about her?

01:08:24.923 --> 01:08:28.828
- She's crazy.
- Yeah. Aren't we all?

01:08:34.067 --> 01:08:38.837
You know, you could leave here
if you want to... with me.

01:08:40.305 --> 01:08:41.809
I like it here.

01:08:46.912 --> 01:08:49.515
'Cause I don't belong
in a crowded world.

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.520
I get that.

01:08:55.488 --> 01:08:56.990
I know you do.

01:09:02.828 --> 01:09:04.697
Let me tell you something.

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:10.837
If you ever meet a loner, I, uh...
I don't care what they say,

01:09:11.837 --> 01:09:14.573
it's not because
they like to be alone.

01:09:16.774 --> 01:09:18.743
It's 'cause they already
tried to fit into the world,

01:09:18.778 --> 01:09:20.648
and something went wrong.

01:09:23.881 --> 01:09:25.586
So let me ask you...

01:09:27.921 --> 01:09:29.788
when does your race end?

01:09:31.091 --> 01:09:32.926
I don't have a race.

01:09:35.395 --> 01:09:36.964
When does yours end?

01:09:38.965 --> 01:09:40.533
When I win.

01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.530
Where have you been hiding?

01:10:11.765 --> 01:10:15.636
Been working.
Don't fucking start.

01:10:16.703 --> 01:10:18.772
Get your ass over here!

01:10:20.539 --> 01:10:22.676
I'm sorry.

01:10:24.476 --> 01:10:27.713
It's not what you asked,
it's how you asked it.

01:10:27.747 --> 01:10:28.981
Stop it!

01:10:33.051 --> 01:10:38.491
Do not ever speak to me
the way you just spoke to me.

01:10:38.524 --> 01:10:40.027
Is that understood?

01:10:41.161 --> 01:10:46.966
I don't care if you can help it.
You try and find a way.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.636
I don't want to do this anymore.

01:11:03.917 --> 01:11:06.653
Your energy's so intense...

01:11:07.886 --> 01:11:10.791
but so soothing
at the same time.

01:11:16.563 --> 01:11:18.399
And your hands...

01:11:20.132 --> 01:11:21.969
they are like magic.

01:11:24.103 --> 01:11:25.706
I love you.

01:11:27.207 --> 01:11:29.543
You're so important to me.

01:11:31.610 --> 01:11:34.980
I don't tell you that enough,
but I should.

01:11:35.014 --> 01:11:36.750
I don't know why.

01:11:38.016 --> 01:11:39.787
You don't need to know.

01:11:41.154 --> 01:11:44.858
Just go with it, like water.

01:11:45.992 --> 01:11:47.627
Hmm.

01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:49.496
Where'd you hear that?

01:11:49.529 --> 01:11:51.598
- Come here!
- No.

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:57.737
Where is he?

01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:59.673
In the back, with the chickens.

01:12:12.252 --> 01:12:13.954
Come.

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.512
I was gonna do those.

01:12:39.546 --> 01:12:42.082
Well, now you don't have to.

01:12:42.114 --> 01:12:44.484
I'm not gonna be
crippled forever, you know.

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:49.789
Whoa, it's getting hot in here.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:52.993
I'm hungry.

01:12:53.025 --> 01:12:54.793
You just ate.

01:12:54.827 --> 01:12:56.630
That doesn't count.

01:12:56.662 --> 01:12:59.131
Well, you're gonna have to wait.

01:12:59.164 --> 01:13:03.202
I've got a big dinner planned tonight, and
I wouldn't want you to spoil your appetite.

01:13:03.235 --> 01:13:05.072
Get out of my kitchen!

01:13:07.673 --> 01:13:08.975
Now!

01:13:17.082 --> 01:13:18.751
Both of you!

01:14:12.838 --> 01:14:14.239
- Just stop it.
- Are you gonna bash my brains in?

01:14:14.273 --> 01:14:15.976
No. No!

01:14:22.381 --> 01:14:25.618
Harder. Harder.

01:14:26.953 --> 01:14:28.221
No!

01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:33.826
What you gonna do?
You gonna fuck me?

01:16:23.235 --> 01:16:25.404
Oh. Not so fast.

01:16:26.506 --> 01:16:29.776
- Come with me.
- I can't leave.

01:16:32.078 --> 01:16:34.247
You could if you wanted to.

01:16:39.819 --> 01:16:41.722
Fuck you!

01:17:56.061 --> 01:17:59.466
You're only halfway there.
I'll show you the way out.

01:18:00.365 --> 01:18:02.301
You better come
if you wanna live.

01:19:14.206 --> 01:19:19.112
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

01:19:21.613 --> 01:19:23.949
Stay low.

01:19:23.983 --> 01:19:26.319
I need to catch my breath.

01:19:29.488 --> 01:19:31.257
You okay?

01:19:31.289 --> 01:19:33.326
I just need a minute.

01:19:46.305 --> 01:19:48.508
I need to get out of here.

01:19:50.242 --> 01:19:52.177
That's the way out.

01:19:53.445 --> 01:19:58.550
Follow the beaten path all the
way up. Go. Get out of here.

01:20:01.287 --> 01:20:05.625
I never said to you thank you...
for saving my life.

01:20:05.658 --> 01:20:09.195
Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:09.228 --> 01:20:11.331
You're welcome.

01:20:40.393 --> 01:20:42.061
I'm sorry.

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:46.599
You should see your face.

01:20:46.631 --> 01:20:48.567
(laughs)

01:20:50.336 --> 01:20:53.506
- Let's go. Let's go.
- I can't go.

01:20:53.538 --> 01:20:57.342
Yeah. You can. You deserve
to be out in the world.

01:20:57.376 --> 01:20:59.479
You think you know
what I deserve?

01:21:00.512 --> 01:21:02.515
You can't be in a place
like this.

01:21:03.783 --> 01:21:06.285
You don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

01:21:06.318 --> 01:21:10.056
You need to go, okay?

01:21:11.256 --> 01:21:13.292
I love my unknown place.

01:21:14.225 --> 01:21:17.229
It feeds me. I crave it.

01:21:18.163 --> 01:21:20.099
You can't be here.

01:21:26.572 --> 01:21:29.109
What's the chances
she actually shoots me, huh?

01:21:32.811 --> 01:21:34.581
She shot our father.

01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:39.585
You're both full of shit.
You're both full of shit.

01:22:47.752 --> 01:22:49.322
I win!

01:22:59.698 --> 01:23:01.301
I want the next one.
