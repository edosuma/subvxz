Savage Crew, I think,
got humbled by the last loss.

02:50.378 --> 02:51.723
We came in there a little cocky.

02:51.758 --> 02:53.620
In the last team challenge,
there was times

02:53.655 --> 02:55.688
where people's egos got
in the way, I think.

as a team.

23:53.792 --> 23:57.413
-Three packages, 404?
-Three packages, 404.

23:57.448 --> 24:01.654
We're still at stop one.
This is all about speed.

24:01.689 --> 24:03.862
Buckled.

24:03.895 --> 24:05.172
FREIGHT TRAIN:
408, one package.

24:06.344 --> 24:07.895
ELIZABETH:
My goal is
don't come in last,

24:07.931 --> 24:09.964
don't come in second to last,
don't go to overtime.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.964
That looks like my grandmother's
house over there.

24:13.758 --> 24:16.172
Elizabeth delivering
a guitar.

24:16.205 --> 24:19.172
-Let there be music.
-Buckled.

24:21.103 --> 24:23.378
We got a nice sprinkler there.
You can cool down.

24:23.413 --> 24:26.034
421, two packages.

24:26.067 --> 24:28.895
424, three packages.

24:28.931 --> 24:31.103
-And 425, one package.
-425, one package.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.619
It's like, okay,
I got the challenge down,

24:32.654 --> 24:34.517
and now let's speed it up,
speed it up, speed it up.

24:36.826 --> 24:37.931
Okay, buckled.

24:40.103 --> 24:42.034
428, two packages.

24:43.481 --> 24:45.413
KEOGHAN:
The key is to just
stay out of overtime.

24:45.448 --> 24:49.034
Every second counts.

24:49.067 --> 24:52.689
-Elizabeth, just a sprint
to the finish line!
-Buckled.

24:52.723 --> 24:54.550
And stop the clock!

24:54.586 --> 24:56.689
[cheering]

24:56.723 --> 24:58.723
Excellent, excellent.

24:58.758 --> 25:01.103
Christine, you're
up next, let's do this!

25:01.136 --> 25:05.344
359, one package.
404, three packages

25:05.378 --> 25:06.378
The challenge is
more memory

25:06.413 --> 25:07.862
and speed than anything.

25:07.895 --> 25:09.826
-Teddy bear!
-Give it some teddy love.

25:09.862 --> 25:13.000
-408.
-421, two packages,

25:13.034 --> 25:16.689
424, three packages,
425, one package.

25:16.723 --> 25:19.103
-421, one?
-Two packages.

25:19.136 --> 25:21.550
Freight Train's reading off
different numbers,

25:21.586 --> 25:23.758
and three or four
different quantities of each.

25:23.792 --> 25:25.413
It's like my mind is
going crazy.

25:25.448 --> 25:27.000
421.

25:27.034 --> 25:29.481
Once I was getting
out on the street,

25:29.517 --> 25:31.034
I was starting
to get confused

25:31.067 --> 25:33.964
as to where things go,
what the layout is.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.067
But today, I am not going
into overtime.

25:36.103 --> 25:37.895
I don't want anything
to do with it.

25:37.931 --> 25:40.240
-Where's 425?
-She doesn't know
where to go.

25:40.275 --> 25:43.103
425.
I realized, hey, dummy,

25:43.136 --> 25:46.723
there's odd and even
house numbers on each side.

25:46.758 --> 25:48.758
Stop the clock!

25:48.792 --> 25:50.103
-[cheering]
-Good job, Christine!

25:51.103 --> 25:53.000
KEOGHAN:
Okay, Quincey! You're up next.

25:53.034 --> 25:56.172
FREIGHT TRAIN:
359, one package.
404, three packages.

25:56.205 --> 25:58.826
QUINCEY:
I'm looking at this competition
as a football game, right?

25:58.862 --> 26:00.586
You know your position
on the field,

26:00.619 --> 26:03.826
and a delivery guy's route is
sort of like a football field.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.586
They have to know where
those packages are

26:05.619 --> 26:07.275
in order for them
to execute the play.

26:07.309 --> 26:09.240
KEOGHAN:
Alfie, you're up next.

26:09.275 --> 26:11.172
ALFIE:
I'm a retired soccer player.

26:11.205 --> 26:12.723
My mindset is
totally scoring a goal.

26:12.758 --> 26:14.378
I got to get
to that doorway.

26:17.826 --> 26:18.826
KEOGHAN:
Lia!

26:18.862 --> 26:20.136
I can't read these.

26:20.172 --> 26:21.448
I'm like,
"I can't read these labels.

26:21.481 --> 26:22.689
I can't read these labels!"

26:22.723 --> 26:25.067
And then it occurs
to me that

26:25.103 --> 26:26.792
I have glasses in my pocket.

26:26.826 --> 26:28.586
Thank you, Lord.

26:28.619 --> 26:31.103
Then I can finally
kick it into gear.

26:31.136 --> 26:32.240
KEOGHAN:
Your turn, Kelsy!

26:32.275 --> 26:34.758
-359. How many packages?
-One package.

26:34.792 --> 26:36.034
KELSY:
I survived overtime.

26:36.067 --> 26:37.240
I know how it feels.

26:37.275 --> 26:39.964
My goal is staying
out of overtime.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.619
Remember to smile
in the camera.

26:41.654 --> 26:43.103
Freight Train is
such a jokester.

26:43.136 --> 26:46.205
Looks like Johnny's home
from music camp.

26:46.240 --> 26:48.067
You know, my daughter was
my helper last year,

26:48.103 --> 26:49.654
and she lifted
heavier weights than that.

26:50.413 --> 26:52.378
It's not time
for our lunch break yet.

26:52.413 --> 26:55.136
He's just a teddy bear
is what he is!

26:55.172 --> 26:57.586
-And here we go.
-Stop the clock for Kelsy!

26:57.619 --> 26:59.448
Good job, Kelsy!

26:59.481 --> 27:01.103
Sarah's up!

27:01.136 --> 27:04.619
359, one package,
404, three packages.

27:04.654 --> 27:07.481
SARAH:
I have no experience
with this challenge.

27:07.517 --> 27:08.964
My mother worked for
the post office,

27:09.000 --> 27:11.034
so I'm kind of
hoping genes will rub off,

27:11.067 --> 27:13.275
but this will definitely be
a new experience for me.

27:13.309 --> 27:14.758
408, one package.

27:17.034 --> 27:18.550
I can't locate the number

27:18.586 --> 27:20.378
on any of the boxes
that I'm looking at.

27:20.413 --> 27:22.931
-408?
-408, one package.

27:22.964 --> 27:24.586
There was time
wasted with that.

27:24.619 --> 27:26.931
Sarah got close to
overtime last time.

27:26.964 --> 27:30.481
She definitely wants to
keep herself safe.

27:30.517 --> 27:31.654
Be careful with
them packages!

27:31.689 --> 27:33.895
Ooh, that's a fragile
package.

27:33.931 --> 27:35.413
Let's go!

27:35.448 --> 27:37.619
I'm not satisfied
with my performance.

27:37.654 --> 27:40.000
My only focus is
to stay out of overtime.

27:40.034 --> 27:42.723
KEOGHAN:
Stop the clock!
Jerome, you're up next.

27:42.758 --> 27:43.758
JEROME:
359, 359.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.378
359? Oh, shoot!

27:45.413 --> 27:46.964
The teddy bear.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.034
I couldn't even find him 'cause
he was stashed in a corner.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.034
How you doing? [grunts]

27:51.067 --> 27:53.862
Oh! Quincey, how about
that leap from Jerome?

27:53.895 --> 27:55.723
Jerome looking like
a football player!

27:55.758 --> 27:57.103
Thank you... [speaks Hawaiian]

27:57.136 --> 27:58.413
KEOGHAN:
Tak, you're up next.

27:58.448 --> 27:59.723
TAK:
I never thought

27:59.758 --> 28:01.826
about being a delivery guy,

28:01.862 --> 28:04.826
-but I do know how to run.
-He is sprinting!
-Wow, he's fast.

28:04.862 --> 28:07.103
-Fast, fast, fast!
-Wow!
-Yeah!

28:07.136 --> 28:09.619
[deep breath]
Good!

28:09.654 --> 28:12.378
-Stop the clock!
-Yeah, Tak!

28:12.413 --> 28:13.964
KEOGHAN:
Hanger, you're up next!

28:14.000 --> 28:17.378
359, one package.
404, three packages.

28:17.413 --> 28:19.964
359, one package. 359...

28:20.000 --> 28:22.723
Biggest worry about
this challenge is,

28:22.758 --> 28:24.000
when I'm under pressure,

28:24.034 --> 28:26.034
numbers start
switching around on me.

28:26.067 --> 28:27.481
359...

28:27.517 --> 28:28.792
When I joined high school,

28:28.826 --> 28:31.240
I was diagnosed with dyslexia.

28:31.275 --> 28:32.862
359, one package?

28:32.895 --> 28:34.517
-359, one package.
-Okay, okay.

28:34.550 --> 28:35.792
In the '60s and '70s,

28:35.826 --> 28:38.654
they didn't know a lot
about dyslexia.

28:38.689 --> 28:41.517
359, one package. 359...

28:41.550 --> 28:45.378
The toughest part was
having educators say,

28:45.413 --> 28:48.172
"You're nothing,
you never will be anything."

28:48.205 --> 28:49.826
And they pushed
me to the side.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.378
I felt like garbage,

28:51.413 --> 28:53.448
and it made me real quiet.

28:53.481 --> 28:56.895
And perhaps, maybe that's
why I'm outgoing today,

28:56.931 --> 28:59.586
because I look back at
that kid...

28:59.619 --> 29:01.931
I'm not that kid anymore.

29:01.964 --> 29:03.862
Oh, he dropped a package.

29:03.895 --> 29:06.275
-Yo, what else?
-425, one package.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.275
425...

29:08.309 --> 29:10.758
Midway, the numbers
start switching around.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.240
I'll see 52, and it's 25.

29:12.275 --> 29:13.205
425...

29:13.240 --> 29:14.240
I started getting nervous.

29:14.275 --> 29:16.034
Come on!
Oh, my God, I messed up.

29:16.067 --> 29:18.619
I do not want to go
over into overtime.

29:18.654 --> 29:21.000
I messed up. Oh, my God,
I messed up.

29:25.792 --> 29:29.034
-425, one package?
-One package.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.826
KEOGHAN:
Hanger losing a lot of
time inside the truck,

29:31.862 --> 29:33.172
struggling with the numbers.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.723
-42 what?
-425.

29:35.758 --> 29:37.378
I messed up.
[groans]

29:37.413 --> 29:38.758
The numbers start
switching around.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.758
I'll see 52, and it's 25.

29:40.792 --> 29:42.689
-Four... twenty-five.
-425.

29:42.723 --> 29:43.792
One package.

29:43.826 --> 29:44.550
I'm telling myself,

29:44.586 --> 29:45.723
"Hey, stay calm, Hanger."

29:45.758 --> 29:47.309
I know I have to stay focused,

29:47.344 --> 29:49.034
repeat the numbers,

29:49.067 --> 29:50.034
and I'm gonna get
through this.

29:50.067 --> 29:51.895
425.

29:51.931 --> 29:55.240
-KEOGHAN: Seconds counting down.
-Package.

29:55.275 --> 29:58.000
Can he stay out of
overtime?

29:58.034 --> 30:00.931
-And Hanger's time
stops right there. Good work.
-Thanks, Freight Train.

30:02.413 --> 30:04.448
Mike, you're up!

30:04.481 --> 30:07.034
359, one package.
404, three packages.

30:07.067 --> 30:09.103
-359, one package.
-One package.

30:09.136 --> 30:11.344
For me, this is very easy

30:11.378 --> 30:13.586
because, as a
lineman, we need to memorize

30:13.619 --> 30:16.034
our stock inventory
for our equipment.

30:16.067 --> 30:18.550
My memorization is
really good.

30:18.586 --> 30:19.826
Here he comes
with the teddy bear.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.826
I think my daughter
will be like,

30:21.862 --> 30:23.240
"Wow, Dad, you're

30:23.275 --> 30:25.000
putting that teddy bear
in a headlock, aren't you?"

30:29.275 --> 30:30.758
KEOGHAN:
Mike, trying to
stay out of overtime.

30:30.792 --> 30:33.413
-Go, Mike! Come on, Mike.
-The clock is ticking!

30:33.448 --> 30:35.758
-Go, Mike!
-Come on, Mike!

30:35.792 --> 30:37.550
-Go, go, go, go, go, go!
-In he goes.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.792
Seat belt on!

30:38.826 --> 30:42.067
And stop the clock for Mike.

30:42.103 --> 30:43.826
-Yeah, Mike!
-Let's go.
-Yeah, Mike.

30:43.862 --> 30:45.240
[grunts]

30:47.000 --> 30:49.448
Amazing job, don't you
think, Freight Train?

30:49.481 --> 30:52.413
-Very good job. You guys can be
my helper anytime.
-Good job, everybody.

30:52.448 --> 30:54.964
And I know you have a special
package for our winner today.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Would you mind
bringing it out?

30:58.517 --> 31:02.619
Today's winner, the
fastest time, it goes to Tak!

31:02.654 --> 31:06.275
[cheering]

31:06.309 --> 31:08.103
-Good job, brother.
-Thank you.

31:08.136 --> 31:10.103
-Congratulations to you.
-Thank you.

31:10.136 --> 31:11.344
You have a special package,

31:11.378 --> 31:13.344
which you can open up
after overtime.

31:13.378 --> 31:14.931
TAK:
I didn't think I was
going to be first

31:14.964 --> 31:17.034
'cause my competitors are
real tough.

31:17.067 --> 31:18.758
I don't know,
God was on my side.

31:18.792 --> 31:21.654
Second fastest time
today: Mike!

31:21.689 --> 31:24.413
[cheering]

31:24.448 --> 31:27.862
What? That-That's insane.
I-I can't believe, like,

31:27.895 --> 31:30.931
I was close to him.
He's lightning, he's fast.

31:30.964 --> 31:33.826
And, uh, Tak is definitely, you
know, someone to look out for.

31:33.862 --> 31:36.517
-Kelsy, third fastest.
-[cheering]

31:36.550 --> 31:40.550
-Fourth fastest, Jerome.
-[cheering]

31:40.586 --> 31:43.826
Lia, six minutes and
three seconds!

31:46.034 --> 31:49.172
Elizabeth, 6:26.

31:49.205 --> 31:51.723
Quincey, 6:28.

31:52.517 --> 31:56.964
Alfie had a time of 6:42.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.344
And then there were
just three:

31:58.378 --> 32:02.448
Christine, Hanger and Sarah.

32:02.481 --> 32:04.309
Two of you will be
going into overtime.

32:04.344 --> 32:05.689
SARAH:
I'm getting nervous.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.000
I did make a lot of
mistakes that cost me time.

32:08.034 --> 32:10.550
Who has the ninth
fastest time?

32:13.413 --> 32:14.689
I definitely
am worried at this point

32:14.723 --> 32:16.344
because everybody looked
so fast,

32:16.378 --> 32:18.136
and I felt so slow.

32:20.309 --> 32:22.309
Sarah, you are safe.

32:22.344 --> 32:24.586
-[exhales]
-Wow.

32:24.619 --> 32:26.931
Hanger, Christine,
you're both going into overtime.

32:26.964 --> 32:29.034
By the end of the day, one of
you will be punching out.

32:29.067 --> 32:31.240
HANGER:
Going into overtime,
I'm focused,

32:31.275 --> 32:33.067
I'm ready, and at 54,

32:33.103 --> 32:34.619
I am gonna throw down,

32:34.654 --> 32:37.000
and I'm going to show what a
union carpenter is all about.

32:37.034 --> 32:39.826
By the end of the day,
one of you will be punching out.

32:39.862 --> 32:41.136
I'll see you all in overtime.

32:44.172 --> 32:45.413
[beeping]

32:46.723 --> 32:48.034
CHRISTINE:
Going into overtime,

32:48.067 --> 32:50.000
I still have a lot
more to prove to myself.

32:50.034 --> 32:53.034
I definitely used to struggle
with my self-worth sometimes.

32:53.067 --> 32:54.826
I limbo between
am I good enough,

32:54.862 --> 32:56.067
or am I not good enough?

32:56.103 --> 32:58.586
I want to prove that I'm
worth it

32:58.619 --> 33:00.344
and that I'm meant to be here.

33:01.344 --> 33:04.448
HANGER:
Going through this competition,
I think about

33:04.481 --> 33:06.067
what legacy am I gonna leave?

33:06.103 --> 33:07.862
How am I gonna be remembered?

33:07.895 --> 33:11.792
Being dyslexic, it doesn't
define me as a person.

33:11.826 --> 33:13.378
I want my daughter
to look at me and say,

33:13.413 --> 33:15.586
"Hey, Dad, I'm so proud of you."

33:15.619 --> 33:16.826
And, "You left everything
on the table,

33:16.862 --> 33:18.619
you gave everything you had."

33:18.654 --> 33:21.792
Christine and Hanger,
this job is all about

33:21.826 --> 33:24.689
organization and attention
to detail.

33:24.723 --> 33:26.895
There are two piles of packages
that need to be delivered.

33:26.931 --> 33:28.000
When the work whistle blows,

33:28.034 --> 33:30.205
you'll be going to
the two piles,

33:30.240 --> 33:32.309
and you will
be sorting the boxes

33:32.344 --> 33:34.067
by which ones are standard,

33:34.103 --> 33:35.964
and which ones are overnight.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.205
30 packages will be going
overnight,

33:38.240 --> 33:40.689
and you will know
which boxes when you scan them,

33:40.723 --> 33:42.448
using one of these
scanners right here.

33:42.481 --> 33:45.103
You point it at the QR code,

33:45.136 --> 33:47.034
and if it says overnight,
you'll know that

33:47.067 --> 33:49.067
that package needs to
go in that truck.

33:49.103 --> 33:51.964
If it says standard,
it doesn't go in the truck.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.413
Freight Train's going to be
checking your work,

33:53.448 --> 33:57.136
and once you have all
30 packages scanned and sorted,

33:57.172 --> 34:00.136
get the thumbs-up from him
so you can start packing boxes

34:00.172 --> 34:01.378
into your truck.

34:01.413 --> 34:04.000
It's a tight fit, I will
tell you that right now.

34:04.034 --> 34:05.895
This is kind of like
a game of Tetris

34:05.931 --> 34:08.000
-using a truck and some boxes.
-[laughter]

34:08.034 --> 34:10.447
The first of you to get
all of your 30 packages

34:10.481 --> 34:13.309
into the back of the truck
and close the back,

34:13.344 --> 34:16.068
you will stay in contention
for the Tough As Nailstitle.

34:16.103 --> 34:17.481
If you finish
this challenge last,

34:17.516 --> 34:19.240
you will be punching out.

34:19.275 --> 34:21.000
-Ready to do this?
-Absolutely.
-Yes.

34:21.034 --> 34:23.793
All right, on the red line.

34:23.827 --> 34:25.793
-You got this, girl.
-On the work whistle.

34:25.827 --> 34:27.688
-Time to get to work.
-[work whistle blows]

34:27.724 --> 34:31.137
-Christine!
-Come on! Come on, Hanger!

34:32.516 --> 34:34.896
HANGER:
We have to scan the packages.

34:34.931 --> 34:36.309
If it says "overnight,"

34:36.344 --> 34:37.655
then you load it.

34:37.688 --> 34:39.896
If it says anything other than
"overnight,"

34:39.931 --> 34:42.034
you put them to the side.

34:42.068 --> 34:44.309
Doing good,
Christine, keep going.

34:44.344 --> 34:45.827
Oh, yes, I like your thinking.
I like your thinking.

34:45.862 --> 34:48.447
Come on, Christine, you got
this, girl, you got it!

34:48.481 --> 34:49.724
This is super
stressful for me.

34:49.757 --> 34:51.481
I love both
Christine and Hanger.

34:51.516 --> 34:54.034
I'm a soccer mom. I am
the epitome of a soccer mom.

34:54.068 --> 34:55.137
Come on, more! More, more!

34:55.172 --> 34:57.275
Who's gonna work
smarter, not harder?

34:57.309 --> 34:59.034
-It's pretty even so far.
-Yeah.

34:59.068 --> 35:02.000
The only thing I'm worried is
maybe she's blocking up

35:02.034 --> 35:03.275
the front of her truck.

35:03.309 --> 35:06.896
-Good job, good job, Hanger!
-Make it count.

35:06.931 --> 35:08.655
I started off doing one by one,
and I'm thinking,

35:08.688 --> 35:11.275
"What am I doing?"
I started grabbing

35:11.309 --> 35:12.757
three or four boxes at a time,

35:12.793 --> 35:14.413
scanning them.

35:14.447 --> 35:17.862
I'm feeling good about this
competition; I'm flying.

35:17.896 --> 35:19.378
QUINCEY:
Leave yourself some room.

35:19.413 --> 35:21.000
LIA:
Good job, Hanger,
good thinking!

35:21.034 --> 35:23.516
KEOGHAN:
Hanger pushing in four boxes
at one time.

35:23.550 --> 35:26.619
LIA:
There you go, keep your head
in the game, you got this!

35:26.655 --> 35:29.172
Watching the overtime
is excruciating.

35:29.206 --> 35:30.896
Hanger is organized.

35:30.931 --> 35:33.034
He's moving more than
one package at a time.

35:33.068 --> 35:35.275
Christine is one package

35:35.309 --> 35:37.550
at a time,
and she's putting all her boxes

35:37.585 --> 35:40.275
right in front of the truck,
blocking her way

35:40.309 --> 35:42.655
into the truck.
[groans]

35:42.688 --> 35:45.413
We can't do anything
to help her.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.447
Keep it coming, pick it up,
pick it up! You got it!

35:47.481 --> 35:48.688
QUINCEY:
Make sure you're focused,
Christine.

35:48.724 --> 35:50.034
Make sure you're focused.

35:50.068 --> 35:52.137
Quicker, quicker, quicker.

35:52.172 --> 35:55.068
See, now she realizes
she was blocking herself in.

35:55.103 --> 35:56.931
QUINCEY:
Dig, Christine, dig!

35:56.965 --> 36:00.206
-Give yourself room.
-There you go!

36:00.240 --> 36:01.757
-Hustle, you got it.
-Good work, Hanger, good work!

36:01.793 --> 36:03.793
-Good work!
-Keep it up, keep it up!
-There it is.

36:03.827 --> 36:05.585
-Christine, make
every trip count.
-Good job, good job.

36:05.619 --> 36:07.619
I know at this point
that I'm behind.

36:07.655 --> 36:09.793
I knew it and I could feel it
and I'm thinking,

36:09.827 --> 36:11.034
"Hey, you know,

36:11.068 --> 36:12.862
"you're only taking one at
a time, maybe take a couple--

36:12.896 --> 36:14.688
make up for some time."

36:14.724 --> 36:17.240
LIA:
That's it! Two packages,
all right, good job!

36:17.275 --> 36:18.965
Christine's got
six more packages outside.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.172
Hanger working on his last one.

36:21.206 --> 36:22.827
KALIMBA:
Let's go, Hanger,
you got it! There you go!

36:22.862 --> 36:25.827
Come on, good job, Hanger!
Good job, Hanger!

36:25.862 --> 36:28.447
-Overnight.
-Get permission!

36:28.481 --> 36:30.240
-Yes, yes!
-Move, move, move!

36:30.275 --> 36:31.585
Keep going!

36:31.619 --> 36:33.309
-Organize. Organize.
-Organize.

36:33.344 --> 36:35.516
Freight Train,
he goes, "Thumbs-up."

36:35.550 --> 36:36.862
-Focus!
-Stay focused!

36:36.896 --> 36:38.550
And so now my strategy

36:38.585 --> 36:42.103
is to load
those heavy ones first,

36:42.137 --> 36:44.481
and then strategically place
all the smaller ones.

36:44.516 --> 36:46.000
KALIMBA:
There you go! You got it.

36:46.034 --> 36:47.896
Christine with one more box.

36:47.931 --> 36:50.655
Everything you've got,
Christine, come on! Up top!

36:50.688 --> 36:52.206
[overlapping shouting]

36:52.240 --> 36:53.619
Am I good?

36:53.655 --> 36:55.378
Yes! Christine gets
the thumbs-up.

36:55.413 --> 36:57.172
Christine, pack good!

36:57.206 --> 36:59.585
-Take your time!
-KEOGHAN: Christine and Hanger
with 30 packages scanned.

36:59.619 --> 37:01.619
LIA:
There you go, Hanger,
there you go!

37:01.655 --> 37:03.378
There you go, Christine,
keep going!

37:03.413 --> 37:05.757
CHRISTINE:
I knew I had to kick it
into overdrive loading

37:05.793 --> 37:08.103
that trailer up,
and I knew in my head from

37:08.137 --> 37:09.516
my moving experience,
you have to make

37:09.550 --> 37:11.068
enough space for everything.

37:11.103 --> 37:13.103
You don't want spaces
in between boxes,

37:13.137 --> 37:15.447
you want everything
to be nice and tight.

37:15.481 --> 37:17.550
QUINCEY:
Stand it up, stand it up!
Doing great!

37:17.585 --> 37:18.862
KEOGHAN:
Hanger sliding everything in.

37:18.896 --> 37:20.550
His door has got to go down
to get the win!

37:20.585 --> 37:21.724
JEROME:
Take your time, come on!

37:21.757 --> 37:23.172
KEOGHAN:
Hanger faster, but does he have

37:23.206 --> 37:25.000
enough room--
that's the question!

37:25.034 --> 37:26.793
LIA:
Hanger! Big boxes!

37:26.827 --> 37:28.413
HANGER:
I'm three-quarters there
and I'm thinking,

37:28.447 --> 37:31.585
"It's not going to fit."
And my adrenaline's flowing.

37:31.619 --> 37:33.447
[grunts]
Come on.

37:33.481 --> 37:35.413
KEOGHAN:
Hanger starting
to pull boxes out!

37:35.447 --> 37:38.172
KALIMBA:
Strategize, Christine,
make sure they fit all in...

37:38.206 --> 37:39.965
KEOGHAN:
He's losing space!

37:40.000 --> 37:41.413
This is Christine's chance
to catch up.

37:41.447 --> 37:43.000
TAK:
Christine,
you're still in this!

37:43.034 --> 37:44.793
You're still in this
Christine, let's go!

37:44.827 --> 37:45.931
KELSY:
Push!

37:45.965 --> 37:47.206
KEOGHAN:
Hanger getting close.

37:47.240 --> 37:48.965
KALIMBA: To the side,
to the side! To the side!

37:49.000 --> 37:50.550
KEOGHAN:
Christine catching up!

37:52.240 --> 37:54.034
-It's not going in.
-KELSY:
Make it fit!

37:54.068 --> 37:55.344
Yeah,
I think he ran out of room.

37:55.378 --> 37:57.034
He's gonna have
to take stuff out.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.275
KEOGHAN:
He's gonna have
to do some repacking.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.550
[sighs]

38:05.344 --> 38:06.896
KELSY:
Come on, Hanger!

38:06.931 --> 38:08.862
KEOGHAN:
Hanger pulling stuff out,
he's got to make room!

38:08.896 --> 38:10.240
LIA:
Don't waste any space!

38:10.275 --> 38:11.655
TAK:
Go, Christine!

38:11.688 --> 38:13.275
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
-Let's go, let's go!

38:13.309 --> 38:15.068
-Good move, good move.
-Come on, there you go!

38:15.103 --> 38:17.896
KEOGHAN:
Hanger down to four boxes,
Christine down to five!

38:17.931 --> 38:19.413
KALIMBA:
Come on, Christine!

38:19.447 --> 38:20.516
CHRISTINE:
I'm starting to get worried,
like, "Hey,

38:20.550 --> 38:22.724
you're running out of space."
I tried

38:22.757 --> 38:24.896
to utilize every nook
and crevice and make it work.

38:24.931 --> 38:27.862
KEOGHAN:
The last few boxes
causing a lot of trouble.

38:27.896 --> 38:31.481
Hanger has one medium-sized box
that he's trying to fit in...

38:31.516 --> 38:33.206
-It won't close.
-...but no!

38:33.240 --> 38:35.655
MIKE:
Hanger's got one box left,
I'm looking

38:35.688 --> 38:37.931
at Christine, I'm like,
"Oh, wow, she's catching up."

38:37.965 --> 38:39.172
My heart's going crazy.

38:39.206 --> 38:40.034
I'm like,
"Hanger, you got this."

38:40.068 --> 38:41.275
KALIMBA:
Come on, Hanger!

38:41.309 --> 38:43.034
HANGER:
I'm pushing this last box in.

38:43.068 --> 38:45.137
It's not going in.
I'm doing everything I can.

38:45.172 --> 38:46.413
I'm not gonna give up.

38:46.447 --> 38:48.931
KALIMBA:
Hey, push it. Push it over...

38:48.965 --> 38:50.309
Over!

38:50.344 --> 38:51.896
TAK:
Yeah, Christine!

38:51.931 --> 38:53.172
Let's go, Christine!

38:53.206 --> 38:55.896
KEOGHAN:
Christine with two small boxes!

38:55.931 --> 38:56.862
Hanger's got one left.

38:56.896 --> 38:58.516
It's down to one!

38:58.550 --> 39:00.206
Who can get the gate down?

39:01.757 --> 39:03.137
Hanger desperate to get
the last one in!

39:03.172 --> 39:04.931
[shouting, clamoring]

39:04.965 --> 39:06.793
And he can't get the gate down!

39:06.827 --> 39:08.827
He's gonna have to take out
to get back in.

39:08.862 --> 39:10.103
[grunts]

39:10.137 --> 39:11.757
TAK:
Go quick!

39:11.793 --> 39:14.550
[shouting, clamoring]

39:19.275 --> 39:20.827
KEOGHAN:
Christine one foot away!

39:20.862 --> 39:23.206
[cheering, clamoring]

39:23.240 --> 39:25.793
Christine gets the win!

39:25.827 --> 39:28.137
[laughs]

39:28.172 --> 39:29.757
Oh, wow.

39:29.793 --> 39:31.103
CHRISTINE:
I got the door shut.

39:31.137 --> 39:33.034
Still in, baby.
[laughs]

39:33.068 --> 39:34.931
If I could talk
to my younger self,

39:34.965 --> 39:38.034
I would tell them that
everything's gonna be okay.

39:38.068 --> 39:40.516
You're gonna face struggles,
but you're the only thing

39:40.550 --> 39:42.413
that's standing
in front of you, and...

39:42.447 --> 39:43.931
I'm not standing
in my way anymore.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.034
-That was a fight right there.
-What a race.

39:46.068 --> 39:47.240
That was a fight.

39:47.275 --> 39:50.034
I am so proud of both of you.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.724
[cheering, whooping]

39:51.757 --> 39:53.413
Christine, a well-deserved win.

39:53.447 --> 39:55.516
[exhales] Thank you.

39:55.550 --> 39:58.000
That Tough As Nailstitle
can still be yours.

39:58.034 --> 40:00.103
Kalimba, you got tears
in your eyes?

40:00.137 --> 40:01.481
I feel like she's
my little sister.

40:01.516 --> 40:03.688
And also, we talked about, like,
there's a difference

40:03.724 --> 40:05.240
between in this because you want

40:05.275 --> 40:07.724
to prove your toughness and
somebody who needs it.

40:07.757 --> 40:10.827
And Christine needs it. And so,
I want to see her win the money.

40:10.862 --> 40:13.516
So, my daughter's 27,
she's gonna be 28.

40:13.550 --> 40:15.309
[exhales]

40:15.344 --> 40:16.862
KALIMBA:
You got this.

40:16.896 --> 40:19.034
When I look at Christine,
I think about my daughter.

40:19.068 --> 40:21.965
And, uh, there are situations
in her life

40:22.000 --> 40:24.655
where Mom and me always--
almost lost her.

40:24.688 --> 40:28.688
So I think about my sister here,

40:28.724 --> 40:30.550
and I love her so much.

40:30.585 --> 40:32.516
That means a lot.

40:35.619 --> 40:37.034
You know, Hanger,
hold your head high.

40:37.068 --> 40:39.757
And have you ever seen
anybody wield a hammer

40:39.793 --> 40:41.068
-like Hanger?
-[laughs]

40:41.103 --> 40:43.034
For the rest of my life,
I am gonna remember

40:43.068 --> 40:45.344
-the way you swung that hammer.
-Right on. Right on.

40:45.378 --> 40:46.481
Hanger, with that,

40:46.516 --> 40:49.172
I am sorry to tell you
that you need to punch out

40:49.206 --> 40:50.827
of the individual competition.

40:50.862 --> 40:52.516
But you're still here
for the team competition.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.688
Your team's got your back,
right, Savage Crew?

40:54.724 --> 40:56.344
-100%.
-We love him. Yes.

40:56.378 --> 40:57.931
You're staying
all the way through to the end.

40:58.827 --> 41:00.793
Head high, Hanger! Yeah!

41:02.068 --> 41:04.309
I didn't want to go out
this way-- I wanted to go

41:04.344 --> 41:06.550
all the way, as far as I could.

41:06.585 --> 41:08.688
But I know my daughter,
when she sees this,

41:08.724 --> 41:10.585
she's gonna say,
"I'm proud of you, Dad."

41:11.550 --> 41:13.793
Now I have to focus,
I have to switch gears,

41:13.827 --> 41:15.724
and I have to be there
for my team.

41:15.757 --> 41:18.206
I'm going to do
my very best for Savage Crew.

41:18.240 --> 41:19.965
Tak?

41:20.000 --> 41:21.965
Since you won
the individual challenge today,

41:22.000 --> 41:25.034
how about you open up
that special package from home.

41:25.068 --> 41:27.034
Just like Christmastime.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.619
-Oh, wow
-Oh, my gosh!

41:28.655 --> 41:30.034
Oh!

41:30.068 --> 41:31.862
Oh, my God.

41:31.896 --> 41:33.447
[all clamoring]

41:33.481 --> 41:34.965
It's a package from my baby

41:35.000 --> 41:38.516
and my fiancé.
My dogs, my stepson...

41:38.550 --> 41:41.275
I can add two, uh,
more pictures to my...

41:41.309 --> 41:42.757
Oh, you've got
more photos to add?

41:42.793 --> 41:45.413
I carry these two with me.

41:45.447 --> 41:47.240
It means the world
to me.

41:47.275 --> 41:50.344
I miss my family so much,
so it means a lot.

41:50.378 --> 41:52.275
-I needed this.
-Oh, group hug!

41:52.309 --> 41:53.724
[laughter, clamoring]

41:53.757 --> 41:54.896
Group hug!

41:54.931 --> 41:57.000
I'm here to make
a better opportunity

41:57.034 --> 41:58.793
for my family, so--

41:58.827 --> 42:00.724
just look at my pictures,
read my letters,

42:00.757 --> 42:03.275
and, um... keep going.

42:03.309 --> 42:04.724
-[laughter]
-You guys smell.

42:04.757 --> 42:07.103
That's exactly
what I was thinking!

42:23.619 --> 42:26.965
-KEOGHAN: Next time
onTough As Nails ...
-QUINCEY: Go, go, go, go!

42:27.000 --> 42:29.275
...sparks are flying
at the Coast Guard.

42:29.309 --> 42:30.103
-Whoa!
-Watch yourself!

42:30.137 --> 42:31.309
Now we're cooking with fire!

42:31.344 --> 42:33.481
-Go, go, go!
-This is a dead even race!

42:33.516 --> 42:35.896
-Relax.
-It could not be closer!

42:35.931 --> 42:37.965
Is anybody here
afraid of the ocean?

42:39.896 --> 42:41.757
ALFIE:
I'm getting into a panic.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.000
-What is he doing?
-Oh, no.
