What About Brian:

00:01.709 --> 00:03.250
What you are is romantic.

00:03.250 --> 00:07.166
For the last two years,
I'm comparing every girl
I go out with to her.

00:07.166 --> 00:11.083
You have to ask yourself, "Who
is worth your time, who is she?"

00:11.083 --> 00:12.834
- I'm in love with Marjorie.
- No.

00:12.834 --> 00:14.458
Adam's in love
with Marjorie.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.667
Adam's your best friend. That
door must close. You hear me?

00:17.667 --> 00:20.583
- Yeah.
- Marjorie is not an option.

00:20.583 --> 00:24.667
Why don't we ever have sex
anymore? We got married
so young, you know?

00:24.667 --> 00:27.834
We missed out on the excitement
a lot of other people had.

00:27.834 --> 00:31.417
- What if we had sex
with other people?
- What?

00:31.417 --> 00:35.000
Oh, my God! You got engaged!
Adam and Marjorie got engaged!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.834
- Where'd they go?
- Las Vegas.

00:37.834 --> 00:40.250
- Brian?
- I have serious feelings
for you.

00:40.250 --> 00:43.667
We're not gonna talk. We're
gonna pretend it never happened.

00:43.667 --> 00:46.709
- Just go back
to the way it was before.
- How do we do that?

00:46.709 --> 00:48.208
Why are there eight places?

00:48.208 --> 00:50.709
Everyone,
this is my friend Lisa.

00:50.709 --> 00:53.291
Lisa, you know Adam.
This is Dave and Deena.

00:53.291 --> 00:54.583
- Hi.
- Nicole and Angelo.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.375
And this is Brian.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.875
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hey.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.875
[♪♪]

01:10.000 --> 01:11.458
What did you think
of Lisa?

01:11.458 --> 01:14.542
She just walked out the door.
I don't think anything.

01:14.542 --> 01:17.166
You have to think something.
You gonna call her?

01:17.166 --> 01:19.875
Did you get her number?
We could double date.

01:19.875 --> 01:22.417
[laughs] You know what?
I can pick my own dates.

01:22.417 --> 01:26.291
- I don't need
a consolation prize.
- That's not what I was doing.

01:27.834 --> 01:31.959
Hey, Casanova. Lisa, Brian.
Looks like a love match.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.959
- [Brian sighs]
- Brian, are you gonna
ask her out?

01:34.959 --> 01:37.417
- No.
- Why not?

01:37.417 --> 01:41.583
Marjorie, you didn't even ask,
you sprung her on me in front
of everybody.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.834
Since when do we ask?
Do you guys ask him?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.625
- No.
- Because he always says no.

01:45.625 --> 01:47.125
You think too much, buddy.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.417
Listen, guys...

01:48.417 --> 01:52.250
Adam, Angelo, can you
come in here? Please?

01:59.625 --> 02:02.208
I don't want to be
fixed up on any more dates.

02:02.208 --> 02:05.291
I don't want any of you
asking me about Lisa from today.

02:05.291 --> 02:10.458
Look, I have my own way
of choosing my own dates,
finding my own women.

02:10.458 --> 02:13.667
I've been on the sidelines
watching you guys live your
lives.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.166
And I'm here to tell ya,
I'm getting in the game.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.291
I'm running my life.
I'm doing what I want.

02:20.291 --> 02:23.250
And I don't care
what anyone else thinks.

02:25.792 --> 02:30.250
- That's a great speech, buddy.
- Yeah. Really great. Well done.

02:30.250 --> 02:34.166
You know, he didn't start
talking till he was three?

02:34.166 --> 02:37.709
Brian, come on.
Come on, Bri, ask her out.

02:39.625 --> 02:42.875
Oh. Hi.
I forgot my cell phone.

02:42.875 --> 02:44.333
I do that all the time.

02:47.166 --> 02:50.667
So, do you want
to go out sometime?

02:50.667 --> 02:52.667
[♪♪]

02:52.667 --> 02:53.667
Um...

02:56.500 --> 03:00.583
Sure. Actually, you know,
Marjorie was saying we could
double date.

03:00.583 --> 03:04.709
That would be great. Let me
put my number in your phone.

03:04.709 --> 03:07.041
Oh. Right. Here you go.

03:10.834 --> 03:12.959
[chuckling]
You were right.

03:16.041 --> 03:17.333
There you go.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.625
[cell phone ringing]

03:21.625 --> 03:24.542
Thank you for fitting us in,
Dr. Oscar.

03:24.542 --> 03:26.667
My schedule
is so crazy.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.500
No problem.
I hear it all the time.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.875
If my couples worked less and
screwed around more, I wouldn't
have patients.

03:32.875 --> 03:36.000
We are not like that. We are
all the time screwing around.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.041
Good.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.375
When I was a young OB,

03:39.375 --> 03:43.125
couples would ask me about
ovulation and what was the
best day to do it?

03:43.125 --> 03:47.709
And I'd just say, brother,
do it every day. Shower her
with sperm.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.583
That's the trick.

03:49.583 --> 03:52.333
Let's see.
You had a miscarriage.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.709
How long did it take you
to get pregnant?

03:54.709 --> 03:56.333
Well, we...

03:56.333 --> 04:00.208
18 months we've been together
and we never really used birth
control.

04:00.208 --> 04:05.500
Well, you did it once.
Obviously, Angelo here
shoots real bullets.

04:05.500 --> 04:10.041
But he could have a low sperm
count, so I think we should
do some tests.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.083
Can you come in tomorrow,
Angelo, and deposit a sample?

04:13.083 --> 04:17.000
Um... Can I just do it at home
and mail it to him?

04:17.000 --> 04:21.917
Has to be fresh. Yeah, those
little suckers die off quickly.

04:24.166 --> 04:28.458
I also teach privates if you
ever need one-on-one... Excuse
me.

04:28.458 --> 04:30.625
Deena, you need a ride?

04:32.333 --> 04:34.917
No, thanks. I like walking.

04:34.917 --> 04:37.083
I waited
after class the other night.

04:37.083 --> 04:40.083
Yeah? Well... [exhales]

04:40.083 --> 04:44.667
I thought about it.
For like an hour, in my car,

04:44.667 --> 04:47.333
parked right over there.

04:47.333 --> 04:49.083
I just thought
I should go home.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.625
You missed out.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.959
Do you think every woman you
meet wants to have sex with you?

04:57.291 --> 05:00.625
I don't call it sex.
I call it healing.

05:02.667 --> 05:04.208
[car honking]

05:08.083 --> 05:09.625
Hey! Mommy.

05:09.625 --> 05:11.208
What are you doing here?

05:11.208 --> 05:13.792
- Thought we'd pick you up.
- You never pick me up.

05:13.792 --> 05:17.208
- Well, we're picking
you up today.
- Yeah, we're picking you up.

05:17.208 --> 05:18.208
OK.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.625
We're gonna
go get a movie.

05:21.625 --> 05:26.375
We want Little Mermaid and Daddy
wants Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

05:26.375 --> 05:30.625
Oh, really? The Little Mermaid
and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

05:30.625 --> 05:32.542
That's a good option,
Daddy.

05:32.542 --> 05:36.166
- What do we say
to the Little Mermaid?
- I want Little Mermaid.

05:38.125 --> 05:41.041
[♪♪]

05:44.500 --> 05:46.458
Is this the Blue Danube?

05:46.458 --> 05:49.875
Yeah. At least they're getting
some culture.

05:54.333 --> 05:59.208
Hey, you remember the thing
we were talking about
the other night?

05:59.208 --> 06:00.583
You know, the...

06:00.583 --> 06:02.417
- About the open marriage.
- Yeah.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.208
Milk?

06:04.208 --> 06:06.417
Milk. Yeah, the open milk.

06:06.417 --> 06:08.000
What about it?

06:10.542 --> 06:12.166
Did you...

06:14.875 --> 06:18.375
Did you drink milk
with Steve the Yoga Guy?

06:24.458 --> 06:25.875
No, I did not.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.333
[sighs]

06:33.041 --> 06:37.500
But I hear he can drink milk
for up to five hours without
finishing the carton.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.500
Wow.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.709
That sounds painful.

06:43.709 --> 06:45.041
[laughing]

06:45.041 --> 06:46.458
Shh!

06:47.083 --> 06:48.709
Sorry.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.834
[♪♪]

07:01.250 --> 07:04.083
So, did you guys decide
on a date for the wedding?

07:04.083 --> 07:06.333
We're not going to
do anything for weeks.

07:06.333 --> 07:08.583
We just want to enjoy
the engagement part.

07:11.875 --> 07:15.083
So, Brian, Marjorie says
you're really into cars.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.792
Yeah, I love old cars.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.583
I mean,
especially in this town.

07:18.583 --> 07:21.709
Literally, every day there's
some car I wish I could buy.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.417
- I have something like that.
- You do?

07:24.417 --> 07:28.583
Lip gloss. I can't stop buying
it. I've got, like, 40 tubes
and pots.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.917
The kind with the wand,
or the sponge-tip.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.667
I can't resist
the sponge-tipped.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.917
Are we still talking
about lip gloss?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.917
Brian,
let's go have a game, huh?

07:38.917 --> 07:40.166
Yeah. Excuse me.

07:40.166 --> 07:41.917
Yeah.

07:50.458 --> 07:53.208
He is so cute.

07:53.208 --> 07:57.333
I haven't had sex in, like,
months. I might even go for
a first-dater.

07:58.125 --> 08:00.291
[laughs] Lisa.

08:02.375 --> 08:03.959
So what do you think
of Lisa?

08:03.959 --> 08:05.834
I don't know.
That lip gloss thing?

08:05.834 --> 08:08.709
- But the body?
- Yep. The body.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.875
[Deena] Have you been
thinking about it?

08:15.875 --> 08:17.291
Sure I have.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.583
What have you been thinking?

08:24.583 --> 08:26.667
I've been thinking...

08:26.667 --> 08:30.291
...that I can't stand the idea
of you drinking milk with
somebody else.

08:30.291 --> 08:34.583
Don't... think about it...
the "me" part.

08:34.583 --> 08:39.792
Because it doesn't really
matter. Honey, I love you.

08:39.792 --> 08:43.709
You're my husband. You're my
partner. You're the father
of my children.

08:43.709 --> 08:47.959
I am never gonna leave you.
That's not what this is about.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.500
OK, what is this about?

08:49.500 --> 08:52.208
Well, I...

08:52.208 --> 08:55.834
think it's about us
each giving each other a gift.

08:57.041 --> 09:01.333
The gift of an adventure,
you know, without lying.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.000
Without losing each other.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.875
It's about us being grown-up
enough to do this thing,

09:09.875 --> 09:14.125
which we will both enjoy,
and still love each other.

09:16.125 --> 09:18.208
If we...
will we still...

09:18.208 --> 09:22.041
Are we gonna still
drink milk together?

09:22.041 --> 09:24.583
Yeah! Of course.

09:26.458 --> 09:31.125
Might even...
taste better if the milk's open.

09:31.875 --> 09:32.875
[chuckles]

09:40.208 --> 09:42.792
Mommy, the movie's over.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.208
Thanks for dinner.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.333
- You're welcome.
Wish you could stay.
- I have the early shift.

09:51.333 --> 09:54.834
Marjorie and I have to have sex
before 11 o'clock or we're both
too tired.

09:54.834 --> 09:55.875
[chuckles]

09:56.750 --> 09:58.834
I bought you something.

09:58.834 --> 10:02.375
It's a new release with
additional scenes.
We got one for us too.

10:02.375 --> 10:03.792
- What is it?
- Spinal Tap.

10:03.792 --> 10:06.417
Oh, that medical thriller.

10:06.417 --> 10:09.083
[Adam] Lisa? I think you left
your cell phone here.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.083
Oh.

10:12.542 --> 10:15.625
I am so sorry about Lisa.
I guess she's not your type.

10:15.625 --> 10:16.917
No, I like her.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.750
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

10:19.583 --> 10:20.583
Good.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.500
Thanks. This is cool.

10:24.667 --> 10:25.959
Every time.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.250
- See ya.
- Bye, sweetie.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.792
- Take care.
- Bye.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.125
Bye.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.291
Good night, Adam.

10:31.291 --> 10:33.125
[Adam] Good night, sugar.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.542
[door closes]

10:42.959 --> 10:44.291
[glasses clink]

10:48.792 --> 10:50.959
[giggles]

11:13.375 --> 11:16.333
I think we kind of missed
the moment, sweetie.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.500
[Lisa] Brian.

11:33.875 --> 11:35.750
I have to go to work.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.542
But you can stay,
have a shower.

11:38.333 --> 11:40.417
Um...

11:40.417 --> 11:42.709
Thanks. For last night.

11:42.709 --> 11:43.875
No, thank you.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.291
I'll call you.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.333
OK.

11:52.542 --> 11:53.542
[door closes]

11:59.000 --> 12:00.041
[door opens]

12:00.041 --> 12:01.667
[Lisa B.]
Good morning, Lisa.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.375
Can you pass me
my razor?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.917
Hey. I'm all soapy here.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.250
[crashes]

12:41.250 --> 12:43.917
Arm hair?
It's a good look for you.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.792
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:50.792 --> 12:54.250
I'm a...
friend of Lisa's.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.792
Oh. Friends. Good.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.417
- I'm Brian.
- Lisa.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.250
Lisa?

13:01.250 --> 13:04.125
Well, Lisa B.
I'm Lisa's roommate.

13:04.125 --> 13:05.458
Nice to meet you, Lisa.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.291
I'm sorry. I...

13:16.291 --> 13:19.417
I'm finished.
With my shower.

13:19.417 --> 13:20.792
Oh. OK.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.792
If you could just...

13:24.792 --> 13:27.125
If you could just
hand me a towel.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.875
OK, here you go.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.208
Thanks.

13:34.917 --> 13:36.500
Ooh.

13:38.125 --> 13:41.333
Well, this is the first time
I've met a guy in my bathroom.

13:44.875 --> 13:47.583
So, Lisa,
what do you do?

13:48.875 --> 13:50.959
Um, well,
I'm a designer.

13:50.959 --> 13:54.208
I have a clothing line I'm
trying to get off the ground.
You?

13:54.208 --> 13:56.875
My partner
and I make computer games.

13:56.875 --> 13:58.417
Oh. Any games
I would know?

13:58.417 --> 14:01.417
Well, Dave designed a game
called Throttle Autobahn.

14:01.417 --> 14:04.500
Throttle Autobahn?
My ex-boyfriend played
all the time.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.208
- Great!
- I hated that game.

14:06.208 --> 14:09.041
- Oh.
- Well, I hated
my boyfriend too.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.041
I'm not really sure
why I was with him.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.834
Self-torture.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.917
- So you're tortured?
- Oh, yeah.

14:16.917 --> 14:19.166
Me too.
I make mixed CDs.

14:19.166 --> 14:20.291
Oh.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.333
Well, um...

14:28.333 --> 14:31.750
I should maybe go put on
some underwear.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.417
Yeah.

14:33.417 --> 14:35.000
- Excuse me.
- OK.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.583
[both clear throat]

14:38.208 --> 14:40.500
Sorry. OK.

14:41.583 --> 14:45.625
Well this is
a good ice-breaker. Nudity.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.709
[♪♪]

14:53.625 --> 14:54.750
See ya, Brian.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.041
Hey, Jimmy.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.709
Is there
a Brian Davis here?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.083
Yeah. I'm his partner.
I could take it.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.208
Oh. Just sign there.
Thanks.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.125
Must be hot out there,
huh?

15:31.125 --> 15:32.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:32.959 --> 15:36.458
You want a water
or a Yoo-Hoo or something?

15:36.458 --> 15:38.583
We got some Yoo-Hoo.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.709
Uh... no.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.542
I'm Dave.

15:45.083 --> 15:47.583
I'm the president
and chairman of Zap Monkey.

15:48.750 --> 15:50.041
We make video games.

15:51.375 --> 15:52.875
Are you trying
to pick me up?

15:54.166 --> 15:58.250
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I'm so lame.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.792
I'm just really rusty
at all this.

16:00.792 --> 16:04.166
I've been married for 13 years
and we're trying open marriage,

16:04.166 --> 16:08.166
not because we don't find each
other attractive. My wife is
a hottie, but...

16:08.166 --> 16:10.208
Everything changed
when we had kids.

16:10.208 --> 16:14.000
Three girls, always sleeping
with us, like "Daddy... "
It's like a zoo.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.500
The arms and legs
and the...

16:18.959 --> 16:21.375
- Be safe out there.
- [door opens]

16:21.375 --> 16:22.959
[baby crying]

16:22.959 --> 16:25.583
[Larissa] She doesn't like
the car seat, Mommy.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.667
[Deena] Honey,
check the diaper, please.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.291
- [Geneva] Larissa,
check the diaper.
- You check it!

16:30.291 --> 16:32.959
- [Geneva] You check it.
- You're closer!

16:37.625 --> 16:41.667
- [Larissa] Code brown.
- [groans] Code brown.
Oh, come on.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.166
[baby screaming]

16:43.166 --> 16:47.083
Hey, let me get it
all cleaned up. I know.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.000
So you got your backpack?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.166
You have a good day
at school, OK?

16:53.166 --> 16:55.750
- OK.
- You go off to school.
Have a good day.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.166
- OK.
- [Richard] Deena!

16:58.166 --> 17:00.166
Oh. Hey, Richard.

17:00.166 --> 17:03.542
A bunch of us are meeting at the
beach around three. Wanna come?

17:03.542 --> 17:04.625
Yeah!

17:04.625 --> 17:08.291
Sure,
I'll see you there. OK.

17:09.667 --> 17:11.417
[school bell rings]

17:12.625 --> 17:14.333
[exhales]

17:14.333 --> 17:18.291
So you have sex with one girl,
and then you pick up another
in her bathroom.

17:18.291 --> 17:19.667
I didn't pick her up.

17:19.667 --> 17:22.583
Oh, God, Brian. If I could
just have a shred of your life.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.208
All I need
is a little crumb.

17:24.208 --> 17:26.583
I think I might really like
this roommate girl.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.583
Why do you always
like the other girl?

17:28.583 --> 17:30.542
I don't always
like the other girl.

17:30.542 --> 17:33.125
You do. You like
the girl you can't have.

17:33.125 --> 17:36.458
Why can't I have her? What,
because I met her in the
bathroom?

17:36.458 --> 17:39.458
Another girl's bathroom,
Brian, that you had sex with.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.500
So what? What, so I should
walk away? I'm not doing
that anymore.

17:43.500 --> 17:47.041
I'm not going to let some other
guy go up and talk to her.

17:47.041 --> 17:49.792
All the other guys
standing around in her bathroom.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.667
Not in the bathroom.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.959
Tonight, she's going to a party.
I saw the invitation on the
table.

17:54.959 --> 17:56.625
Some club down here.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.792
The new Brian is going to find
a way to go to that party.

17:59.792 --> 18:01.625
How do you know
the invitation's for her?

18:01.625 --> 18:03.625
- Her name was on it.
- What's her name?

18:03.625 --> 18:05.792
- Lisa.
- I am so confused.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.250
We need Adam.

18:07.250 --> 18:08.792
[Adam on phone]
Roommates!

18:08.792 --> 18:11.166
Hmm. Yeah,
you have to go for it.

18:11.166 --> 18:14.917
It's not as good as sisters,
which is not as good as twins,
but, hey...

18:14.917 --> 18:18.083
Hey, Brian,
you could go for two in 24.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.792
Is he talking about
what I think he's talking about?

18:20.792 --> 18:23.083
I'm not gonna do that.
I really like this girl.

18:23.083 --> 18:26.417
Blah blah blah. If you nail
Lisa B. before midnight
tonight,

18:26.417 --> 18:29.417
you will be entering a pantheon
not even I have entered.

18:29.417 --> 18:32.667
I've never done two in 24.
I did one and a half in 36.

18:32.667 --> 18:34.000
What's a half?

18:35.750 --> 18:38.625
I just want to see her,
that's all. If I could
get into the party...

18:38.625 --> 18:40.375
- Take me with you.
- [Brian] What?

18:40.375 --> 18:42.792
Come on. Let me just live
one night of your life.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.959
Please, Bri. I've had one
in 13 years, and not often.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.166
If Dave goes, I go.

18:47.166 --> 18:49.291
My life is not
a spectator sport!

18:49.291 --> 18:51.709
Yeah, I'll meet you guys there.
And Dave?

18:51.709 --> 18:53.166
Yeah, buddy?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.375
Don't wear that dork crap
or we'll never get in.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.417
You got it, pal.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.959
Come on, this is great, a night
on the town. Three single guys.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.417
- You're not single.
- I am tonight.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.166
- Jimmy!
- [Jimmy] Yeah!

19:11.333 --> 19:14.458
[Lisa] Her BP's steady,
but she's not taking liquids.

19:14.458 --> 19:18.250
OK. Start her on an IV,
half normal saline and KVO.

19:18.250 --> 19:20.792
Aren't you gonna ask me
how it went with Brian?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.125
How'd it go with Brian?

19:22.125 --> 19:25.917
It went all the way.
Am I bad?

19:25.917 --> 19:27.291
I don't know.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.750
It was just, like, carnal.
It just happened.

19:29.750 --> 19:35.333
I'm not even sure I want to go
out with him again, but in bed,
oh, my God.

19:35.333 --> 19:40.458
He does this one thing, where
he, like, French kisses your
belly...

19:40.458 --> 19:41.834
I gotta go do my rounds.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.083
Oh, sure.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.291
Well, thanks, for Brian.

19:48.458 --> 19:51.500
So he calls us into
the conference room, and he says

19:51.500 --> 19:55.333
three of us will be offered
partnerships by the end of
the year.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.667
The end of the year.
Oh, my God.

19:57.667 --> 20:00.875
Sharon's gonna get one, Michael
speaks all those languages,

20:00.875 --> 20:04.500
which leaves one spot. I think
it's between Piedmont and me.

20:04.500 --> 20:05.834
Piedmont!

20:07.417 --> 20:09.208
You OK?
You're not listening.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.375
I was listening.
Piedmont. We hate Piedmont.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.041
What's up?

20:15.041 --> 20:19.542
[exhales] Are you gonna miss
sleeping with other people?

20:19.542 --> 20:21.625
Are you gonna miss that?

20:23.667 --> 20:26.709
Yeah, yeah. Won't you?

20:28.208 --> 20:30.083
But you want
to get married?

20:32.208 --> 20:35.542
Yes, baby. Yes, I really
want to get married.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.542
I do, I really do.

20:37.542 --> 20:38.583
I do too.

20:40.333 --> 20:43.208
Maybe we should forget
about the whole two-week rule

20:43.208 --> 20:45.208
and start talking
about the wedding.

20:45.208 --> 20:49.125
- What's there to talk about?
- I don't know, planning?

20:49.125 --> 20:52.583
- You'll be doing
all the planning.
- I will?

20:52.583 --> 20:55.166
- Well, don't you want to?
- Why would I want to?

20:55.166 --> 20:56.417
Because you're a woman.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.917
Women... like doing that?
I don't...

21:02.917 --> 21:04.792
I have a job, too.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.083
Yeah, but your job is...
it's totally...

21:07.083 --> 21:08.834
My job is totally what?

21:08.834 --> 21:11.583
Your job is totally secure,
mine isn't.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.208
That's all
I was going to say.

21:14.792 --> 21:18.166
Marjorie, this is my year
to make partner. If I don't,
that's it.

21:18.166 --> 21:21.250
My picture's on the back of
a bus hawking accident victims.

21:21.250 --> 21:24.333
What are you saying? You want
to wait a year to get married?

21:24.333 --> 21:28.000
No, no. No. What?
I'm sorry, what are we...

21:28.000 --> 21:29.583
We can talk tonight.

21:29.583 --> 21:32.208
I can't. Boys' night
with Brian and Dave.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.000
Oh, so you're too busy
to plan our wedding

21:35.000 --> 21:37.458
but you're not too busy
to have a boys' night?

21:37.458 --> 21:39.291
- Are you gonna bust me?
- No.

21:39.291 --> 21:40.959
It never
bothered you before.

21:40.959 --> 21:45.125
OK, fine. Go out. I'm gonna stay
at my place tonight. I'll call
you later.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.792
Marjorie, sit down.
Marj... Oh, Marjorie.

21:48.792 --> 21:49.959
[groans]

21:57.792 --> 21:59.083
[knocks]

22:04.041 --> 22:07.375
Hi, I am Angelo Varzi.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.709
I'm here
to deposit my sample.

22:09.709 --> 22:11.083
Just have a seat.

22:11.083 --> 22:14.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
[chuckles] I'm...

22:35.667 --> 22:37.667
[woman moans on TV]

22:38.667 --> 22:40.500
[woman on TV] Yeah.

22:58.375 --> 23:01.083
It's a fashion show party.
It's at the Red Temple.

23:01.083 --> 23:02.709
I know.
My friend's DJ'ing.

23:02.709 --> 23:04.041
Well, you can get me in.

23:04.041 --> 23:07.291
Of course I can. The question
is, do I wanna get you in?

23:07.291 --> 23:11.041
Yes, you wanna get me in.
And Adam and Dave too.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.083
- Brian!
- I'll hire your band
for our game.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.834
You'll hire three
of my bands.

23:15.834 --> 23:17.417
- Two.
- Done.

23:17.417 --> 23:19.458
Where's Ange?
Wasn't he coming?

23:19.458 --> 23:24.250
He's at the fertility clinic.
Leaving a sperm sample.

23:24.250 --> 23:28.583
What? Oh, that is too good.
Give me your phone.

23:28.583 --> 23:29.709
- No.
- Give it to me.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.500
- No!
- Give it to me!

23:32.500 --> 23:33.709
[chuckling]

23:35.208 --> 23:37.041
[cell phone ringing]

23:44.834 --> 23:46.291
Amore. Amore.

23:46.291 --> 23:47.917
[Brian] How's it coming,
big boy?

23:49.792 --> 23:52.959
- Damn it, Brian!
- Are you a righty or a lefty?

23:52.959 --> 23:54.959
Honey, honey, it's me.

23:54.959 --> 23:56.166
Is Brian still there?

23:56.166 --> 23:57.750
No, no!

23:57.750 --> 23:59.709
OK. Don't let him
hear you, OK?

23:59.709 --> 24:02.250
- What's going on?
- I can't do it.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.333
Of course you can.
I've seen you do it.

24:04.333 --> 24:05.834
It's disgusting here.

24:05.834 --> 24:08.542
They have porno
where everyone is faking, and...

24:08.542 --> 24:11.667
the women in the magazines,
they have breasts,

24:11.667 --> 24:14.000
it's, like, hard,
like bocce balls.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.583
Just think about me, honey.

24:15.583 --> 24:16.959
Think about what we do.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.291
Can you help me?

24:21.959 --> 24:24.625
OK. We can do this.

24:26.875 --> 24:29.917
We're in a gondola...

24:29.917 --> 24:32.875
...and I'm naked.

24:32.875 --> 24:35.041
I'm wearing nothing
but a black...

24:36.250 --> 24:39.291
[inaudible]

24:44.625 --> 24:45.709
Hello?

24:45.709 --> 24:47.625
[seagulls squawking]

24:52.792 --> 24:53.792
Hey!

24:55.166 --> 24:56.166
Hey.

24:57.083 --> 24:59.458
Hey. Where is everybody?

24:59.458 --> 25:03.500
Oh. Wimps. Wimp moms.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.041
It's too cold for them.

25:06.041 --> 25:09.041
So I'm not a wimp mom?
[giggles]

25:09.041 --> 25:11.083
No. You're a hot mom.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.333
No, I'm not.

25:14.333 --> 25:16.709
That's what we all call you
at the school picnics.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.834
Actually,
we call you tattoo mom.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.709
There are a lot of
tattoo moms in Venice.

25:20.709 --> 25:24.250
Yeah. Skanky tattoo moms,
not hot tattoo moms.

25:24.250 --> 25:26.166
It's a big difference.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.500
[children yelling]

25:28.500 --> 25:31.834
I don't care if it's cold.
My kids would go to the park
in a hailstorm.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.000
I'm kinda glad
no one else showed up.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.792
[cell phone rings]

25:42.792 --> 25:45.250
Sorry, I just... Yeah.

25:45.250 --> 25:48.834
So, Bri and I have to go
to this gaming party thing.

25:48.834 --> 25:52.250
You know, it's like
a whole gaming party.

25:52.250 --> 25:55.583
Uh, I'm not going to be home
till later on tonight, so...

25:55.583 --> 25:58.542
But I gotta do it, 'cause
I can't get out of it tonight.

25:58.542 --> 26:01.041
Oh, I won't wait up.

26:01.041 --> 26:04.750
OK, cool. I'll talk
to you later. Bye.

26:07.917 --> 26:09.250
Not coming home?

26:11.542 --> 26:13.875
[baby coos]

26:13.875 --> 26:18.959
Listen, you want to... get
a pizza or something later?
With the kids?

26:20.625 --> 26:21.792
Yes, I would.

26:23.166 --> 26:25.667
What do you think?
Pizza? Pizza?

26:37.250 --> 26:40.583
[techno music]

26:40.583 --> 26:43.667
- [Bouncer] Name, please?
- Come on, handsome, let's go.

26:43.667 --> 26:44.667
All right.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.709
You could get two
in 24 minutes in this place.

27:04.709 --> 27:06.083
Shut up.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.750
- [Bartender]
Eighteen bucks, man.
- Keep the change.

27:10.750 --> 27:12.166
Thank you.

27:12.166 --> 27:15.458
Twenty bucks?
That's, like, ten bucks a beer.

27:15.458 --> 27:17.333
Are you kidding me?
That's a deal.

27:25.959 --> 27:28.458
Are we OK with this?

27:29.542 --> 27:31.125
He's just talking.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.000
- There she is, wish me luck.
- Good luck.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.333
[chuckles]

28:03.291 --> 28:07.417
Sorry, I'm spilling my beer
everywhere. I'm gonna get rid
of this, all right?

28:13.917 --> 28:15.583
That's my drink!

28:15.583 --> 28:16.583
It's a ten dollar...

28:18.000 --> 28:19.000
Hey.

28:20.959 --> 28:23.709
- How ya doing?
- All right.

28:23.709 --> 28:24.917
Great party, right?

28:24.917 --> 28:25.917
Mm-hmm.

28:26.834 --> 28:28.000
Yeah.

28:28.000 --> 28:31.625
Hey, what's up, dude?
Work out, huh?

28:31.625 --> 28:32.709
Mm-hm.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.709
You two know each other?

28:41.208 --> 28:43.375
[water running]

28:51.041 --> 28:52.166
[exhales]

29:00.291 --> 29:01.959
Oh, what am I doing?

29:05.542 --> 29:06.542
[chuckles]

29:07.208 --> 29:09.417
[chattering]

29:11.917 --> 29:14.625
I have them
three days a week.

29:14.625 --> 29:17.709
Three days. Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, you know?

29:18.500 --> 29:21.000
I never get Friday.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.959
I never have
that Friday afternoon,

29:22.959 --> 29:25.792
"school's out total
elation" thing, you know?

29:25.792 --> 29:29.083
I never have
Saturday morning cartoons.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.583
It's just...
I don't ever get that.

29:32.417 --> 29:34.583
That is so sad.

29:34.583 --> 29:39.083
I mean, I just have to see them
every day, you know, in every
light.

29:39.083 --> 29:43.000
You just don't want to miss
a moment because every day
is just like...

29:43.000 --> 29:46.166
It's a sheet in the wind,
you know?

29:46.166 --> 29:50.417
Every minute is a minute that
you're never gonna get back.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.375
I could never
do what you do, Richard.

29:55.375 --> 29:58.834
Well, you probably
wouldn't have to.

29:58.834 --> 30:01.917
Moms usually get the better deal
when you get divorced.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.792
I'm never getting a divorce.

30:05.458 --> 30:06.667
Right.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.750
I like being married.

30:08.750 --> 30:12.166
- Do you?
- Yes.

30:14.291 --> 30:17.500
That's Geneva,
she just started first grade.

30:17.500 --> 30:22.041
And that's Larissa,
she's a daddy's little girl.

30:22.041 --> 30:24.125
And the baby is Carrie.

30:25.291 --> 30:26.625
They're cute.

30:26.625 --> 30:30.083
Yeah, yeah.
You should see...

30:34.333 --> 30:38.208
If you're gonna show those
pictures, at least pretend
your wife just died.

30:38.208 --> 30:42.583
This is my life. I got nothing
else to talk about.

30:42.583 --> 30:45.500
What are you doing here?
You should go home.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.417
- So should you.
- Yeah, I'm not married yet.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.041
Let me ask you something.

30:51.041 --> 30:54.333
You think any of these girls
could hold a candle to Marjorie?

30:57.583 --> 30:59.375
Any one?

31:06.375 --> 31:09.083
- We're leaving!
- The night is young!

31:09.083 --> 31:11.375
- Yeah, Dave can't do it!
- Do what?

31:12.125 --> 31:13.542
I gotta go home.

31:13.542 --> 31:16.291
Maybe the whole open marriage
thing's a bad idea!

31:16.291 --> 31:20.250
Yeah, dude, it could be very
destructive to the fragile
ecosystem of...

31:20.250 --> 31:22.709
Have fun!

31:22.709 --> 31:25.208
- I'm not doing that!
- Not doing what?

31:25.208 --> 31:26.625
- What?
- What?

31:26.625 --> 31:28.125
[laughing]

31:32.041 --> 31:33.375
[chuckles]

31:34.875 --> 31:37.875
You know, it's so weird
that you ended up here tonight.

31:37.875 --> 31:41.875
- I know.
- It's like fate or something.

31:41.875 --> 31:43.333
It is.

31:43.333 --> 31:47.208
Or maybe you saw the invitation
on my coffee table.

31:47.208 --> 31:48.542
I'll never tell.

31:50.875 --> 31:54.875
[sighing] You know, we really
shouldn't do this. With Lisa
and everything.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.417
You're right,
we shouldn't.

32:01.041 --> 32:04.792
You know,
it would be really weird.

32:06.917 --> 32:08.917
It would really be weird.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.667
Hey, you gonna
come to bed?

32:25.375 --> 32:28.625
Yeah, in a minute.
My sister might call from Rome.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.583
I'm sorry about the clinic.

32:34.750 --> 32:38.417
Yeah, I know.
I hate that clinic.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.625
Honey...

32:43.166 --> 32:46.625
I don't want to make a baby
with a sample in a cup.

32:47.875 --> 32:50.750
I just want
to make love to you.

32:50.750 --> 32:55.625
Can't we just have as much sex
as possible and hope for the
best?

32:55.625 --> 32:58.500
And if you get pregnant,
we do.

32:58.500 --> 33:03.709
If we don't, I'm OK.
I have you.

33:03.709 --> 33:06.041
[♪♪]

33:07.667 --> 33:09.208
Don't you want more?

33:14.125 --> 33:15.291
I don't know.

33:16.291 --> 33:18.166
Honey.

33:19.709 --> 33:22.041
You married an older woman.

33:22.041 --> 33:27.333
Maybe we can try with some herbs
or take your temperature or
something...

33:27.333 --> 33:30.834
- Can we just talk
about this tomorrow?
- Nicole.

33:39.792 --> 33:43.834
Don't leave.
Stay, we can watch a DVD.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.166
What DVD?

33:50.083 --> 33:51.333
Spinal Tap.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.333
[chuckles]
I love that movie.

33:55.208 --> 33:59.000
I'm sorry, Brian. I just... I
don't even know what I'm gonna
say to Lisa.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.959
Lisa doesn't even like me.

34:07.291 --> 34:10.291
Look. It was fun.

34:10.291 --> 34:13.208
But...
it would just be too...

34:14.542 --> 34:15.542
Weird.

34:17.834 --> 34:18.834
Yeah.

34:26.208 --> 34:29.333
Can I... Can I call you?

34:33.542 --> 34:34.875
I don't think so.

34:40.208 --> 34:41.667
I'll see you.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.458
I thought you were
going to stay at your place.

35:20.458 --> 35:22.000
I changed my mind.

35:41.834 --> 35:45.083
- Are those for me?
- No.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.834
These are mine.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.500
I can't let you
plan this thing alone.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.959
You have terrible taste.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.000
[laughing]

35:59.625 --> 36:01.291
Oh!

36:01.291 --> 36:03.333
You don't like it?
It's my favorite.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.625
All she needs
is a propeller on her head.

36:13.875 --> 36:16.417
I'm sorry.

36:16.417 --> 36:19.166
[♪♪]

37:10.792 --> 37:12.542
I love you, baby!

37:12.542 --> 37:14.166
I'm so glad to be home!

37:14.166 --> 37:18.333
- Daddy, you're too loud.
- Shh.

38:35.959 --> 38:37.834
[whistles]

38:37.834 --> 38:39.375
[dog barks]

38:39.375 --> 38:42.959
Hey, buddy. You want to see
a really good movie? Huh? Huh?

38:42.959 --> 38:43.959
[growls]

38:46.041 --> 38:47.125
Come on.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.750
Too much! All right.
