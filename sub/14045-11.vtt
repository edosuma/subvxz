WEBVTT

00:03.562 --> 00:04.839
So he still has the bike?

00:05.004 --> 00:06.650
He promises weekends only,

00:06.674 --> 00:08.681
and then on Friday, he rides it to work.

00:08.724 --> 00:10.704
He says that's the start of the weekend.

00:10.728 --> 00:11.903
So you get pregnant,

00:11.927 --> 00:13.363
he goes back to being an adrenaline junkie.

00:13.387 --> 00:15.088
Yeah, that's who he
is, which is frustrating

00:15.112 --> 00:16.934
because he's obviously happy.

00:16.958 --> 00:19.084
What is this, 1950? Clearly,<i>
you're</i> not happy.

00:19.108 --> 00:21.257
Bozo went B.A.S.E.
jumping two weekends ago.

00:21.281 --> 00:23.839
Okay, he went parasailing
strapped to the back of an A.T.V.

00:23.863 --> 00:25.057
I mean, really, who does that?

00:25.081 --> 00:26.967
- So tell him to stop.
- I can't do that.

00:26.991 --> 00:29.646
He loves that stuff. I mean...

00:29.670 --> 00:30.693
He will resent me.

00:30.717 --> 00:33.347
And I know I would resent
him if he tried to change me.

00:33.371 --> 00:35.130
But you're not risking your life.

00:35.154 --> 00:37.104
He has to be more
responsible to you, right?

00:37.127 --> 00:40.329
I agree. But... it's the man that
I fell in love with, you know?

00:40.353 --> 00:41.438
It's what made him different

00:41.462 --> 00:42.638
from the other guys I was dating.

00:42.662 --> 00:45.696
Which is fine if you are <i> dating,</i>
but now he's gonna be a father.

00:45.719 --> 00:47.405
I think there... there has
to be a middle ground, huh?

00:47.429 --> 00:48.761
- Yeah. We're still trying to find it.
- We're on it.

00:48.785 --> 00:50.318
Gwen, M.V.A. in Prospect Hill.

00:50.342 --> 00:51.667
Auto versus auto sounds bad.

00:51.691 --> 00:53.133
Okay, I'm on it. See ya. Catch you later.

00:53.157 --> 00:54.455
Hey, what are you doing
here? Isn't it your night off?

00:54.479 --> 00:55.885
Yeah. I wanna go on a ride-along with you.

00:55.909 --> 00:57.454
No. I'm serious.

00:57.478 --> 00:58.563
Look, I already got Topher's permission.

00:58.587 --> 01:00.541
- I just need yours now.
- Why do you wanna do this?

01:00.565 --> 01:01.440
'Cause I'm the new charge nurse,

01:01.464 --> 01:02.614
but I don't feel much in charge yet.

01:02.638 --> 01:04.232
I wanna experience what
happens to the patients

01:04.256 --> 01:05.272
before they come to us.

01:05.297 --> 01:07.343
Careful what you wish for.
It can get crazy out there.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.038
Anything goes down, I'll
be there to protect you.

01:09.062 --> 01:11.188
Oh, honey, I've seen things
that'll make you wet your pants.

01:11.212 --> 01:12.348
I'm ready for anything.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.397
Just make sure you don't slow me down.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.982
- All right? Get in there.
- Ha ha! Yes!

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.327 --> 01:30.863
Whoa! Watch out for lives wires!

01:33.728 --> 01:34.858
Yeah, be careful.

01:39.732 --> 01:40.976
What do we got?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.886
We got one female with a leg
laceration. Right over there.

01:43.910 --> 01:45.574
- Shane! Shane!
- Hey.

01:45.598 --> 01:46.653
- Oh, my God!
- Okay.

01:46.677 --> 01:49.107
Shane! Uh, y-you have
to go help my boyfriend.

01:49.131 --> 01:50.276
He's trapped under there.

01:50.300 --> 01:51.675
- The thing came crashing down on him.
- All right,

01:51.699 --> 01:52.711
just take it... just calm down.

01:52.735 --> 01:54.113
- Let me take a look at this.
- Shane?

01:54.136 --> 01:56.510
- Just be patient, please. Everything's gonna be okay.
- Okay.

01:56.534 --> 01:58.639
- What's your name?
- M-my name's Lindsay.

01:58.663 --> 02:00.383
All right, Lindsay, anything else hurt?

02:00.407 --> 02:01.934
- No, just my leg.
- Okay.

02:06.754 --> 02:08.872
Oh, Lordy. You see that ride?

02:08.896 --> 02:11.199
You saw that ride, didn't
you? Oh, man!

02:11.223 --> 02:13.105
You've been impaled. Don't move.

02:13.129 --> 02:14.639
- Oh, well, so I have.
- Yeah.

02:14.663 --> 02:16.172
- I'm Shane McCoy.
- Yeah?

02:16.196 --> 02:18.070
Yeah. You seen me ride
out there, didn't you?

02:18.094 --> 02:20.079
- Okay, hold still. Okay?
- It was a shame the way it ended, though.

02:20.103 --> 02:22.131
I could've ridden that
bull till sunset, you know.

02:22.155 --> 02:24.141
- Okay, okay. I-I need you to stop talking, okay?
- I'd-a had my 8 seconds, too.

02:24.165 --> 02:25.754
You lost a lot of blood.
Your heart is racing.

02:25.778 --> 02:26.986
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna push this off you.

02:27.009 --> 02:28.055
- On three.
- Okay.

02:28.079 --> 02:29.302
Okay, one...

02:29.327 --> 02:30.846
Two... Three.

02:44.783 --> 02:46.734
- Shane!
- Tee!

02:46.758 --> 02:48.273
Ohh!

02:48.297 --> 02:50.191
Whoa, ho!

02:50.215 --> 02:51.654
What a rush, huh?

02:51.678 --> 02:53.746
What a rush! What a rush!

02:53.770 --> 02:55.461
That's bull ridin', son.

02:55.485 --> 02:57.387
- Yeah.
- Never felt so alive.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.163
- That was something.
- Yeah!

02:59.187 --> 03:00.949
Tee!

03:00.973 --> 03:02.572
- Holy...
- Close call.

03:02.596 --> 03:04.977
Just... Be careful.

03:05.506 --> 03:09.005
High time we got this started. Thank you.

03:09.495 --> 03:10.772
- Hey, Topher.
- Oh. Hey.

03:10.796 --> 03:12.752
Um, I just wanted to make sure
that you got my application

03:12.776 --> 03:15.334
- for my second year...
- Chief resident track. Got yours and Paul's.

03:15.358 --> 03:17.239
Too bad there's only one
slot for the two of you.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.405
Aah! Aah!

03:19.429 --> 03:20.551
What's this all about?

03:20.575 --> 03:22.284
- Oh, Ragosa's taking his medical boards next week...
- Warn me first!

03:22.308 --> 03:24.289
And they hooked him up to a
neurostimulator to quiz him.

03:24.313 --> 03:25.879
- Savages.
- No, it's his idea.

03:25.903 --> 03:27.525
- He wanted the motivation.
- You wanna be a big swinging doctor,

03:27.549 --> 03:29.050
- you gotta handle the pressure.
- Aah! Let's do this!

03:29.074 --> 03:31.760
Okay, okay. Um, 10 causes
of pancreatitis. Go!

03:31.784 --> 03:33.286
Gallstones, ethanol, trauma,

03:33.310 --> 03:34.395
- drugs, mumps...
- Faster!

03:34.419 --> 03:35.493
Mumps... aah!

03:36.429 --> 03:38.218
Uh... Steroids, autoimmune,

03:38.242 --> 03:39.584
hyperlipids aah!

03:39.608 --> 03:41.749
- Hey, I was right!
- Sorry, I slipped.

03:41.773 --> 03:42.845
Ohh.

03:42.869 --> 03:43.782
Idiopathic...

03:43.806 --> 03:46.172
You got that look in
your eyes. Don't do it.

03:46.196 --> 03:47.701
No. No, don't do it!

03:47.725 --> 03:48.754
Ow!

03:48.778 --> 03:50.472
You had it on high, didn't you?

03:50.496 --> 03:51.897
- Hey, Topher?
- Scorpion stings.

03:51.921 --> 03:53.650
- I knew that.
- Yeah?

03:53.697 --> 03:55.232
Okay, next one.

03:55.256 --> 03:56.365
Okay, thanks.

03:56.389 --> 03:58.134
Okay, people! Fun's over.

03:58.158 --> 04:00.374
Multiple trauma coming in
from the rodeo. Let's be ready.

04:00.397 --> 04:01.766
All right, I'll take incoming in Trauma 4.

04:01.790 --> 04:03.385
Ragosa, Mollie, get rooms ready!

04:03.409 --> 04:05.671
- Ready on high.
- Double-time, people! Let's go!

04:07.734 --> 04:09.300
- Hey, did you see that?
- Hey!

04:09.324 --> 04:11.680
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Paramedic coming through! Make a way.

04:11.704 --> 04:13.325
- Make a way. Back up, please. Make a path. Make a path.
- What are you doing?

04:13.349 --> 04:15.481
- Get off of him. Everybody, please, step back!
- Give us some room here!

04:15.505 --> 04:18.108
- I'm not gonna tell you again. Get off my son!
- Where's the driver?

04:18.132 --> 04:20.779
- Here's over here! Hurry! Move!
- I'm not gonna tell you again before I kick your ass!

04:20.803 --> 04:23.725
- I'm gonna need you to step back.
- He's the one who hit my boy! He was the driver!

04:23.749 --> 04:24.953
- Calm down. Calm down.
- Sir, I'm a paramedic.

04:24.977 --> 04:26.054
- I'm gonna need you to step aside, okay?
- Step back.

04:26.078 --> 04:30.254
- Hey, buddy, come on. Let her work. Let her work.
- Sir, I'm not gonna tell you twice!

04:30.278 --> 04:31.687
Scott?

04:51.006 --> 04:52.379
- Did you see that?!
- So messed up!

04:52.403 --> 04:54.362
- He's barely breathing.
- Dr. Scott, you are bleeding.

04:54.386 --> 04:55.618
And we gotta get him out of here now!

04:55.642 --> 04:57.868
Look, I'm not gonna tell you again!

04:57.892 --> 04:59.276
Take your hands off my boy!

04:59.300 --> 05:01.766
Get that under control,
all right?! Calm down.

05:01.790 --> 05:04.956
What are you doing? That
man should be in jail!

05:04.989 --> 05:06.428
- Calm down.
- Hey, look, man!

05:06.461 --> 05:07.845
Hey, Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! I got this.

05:07.869 --> 05:10.283
Listen to me carefully, 'cause
I'm only gonna say this once.

05:10.307 --> 05:12.461
That man is a doctor.
You want your son to live?

05:12.485 --> 05:13.926
- Okay. One...
- You let us work, let us get to the hospital.

05:13.950 --> 05:15.795
- Two... Three!
- It is that simple. Is that clear?

05:15.819 --> 05:17.962
He hit my boy.

05:17.986 --> 05:20.066
And now he's trying to help.

05:20.090 --> 05:21.128
Okay?

05:21.152 --> 05:23.078
Hey, I'm gonna need a
statement from the driver.

05:23.108 --> 05:24.869
- Can it wait for the hospital?
- Let's go! Let's go!

05:24.893 --> 05:26.163
- Clear a path!
- Let's go!

05:26.187 --> 05:27.319
- Ready?
- All right, step back.

05:27.343 --> 05:29.626
- One... Two... Three.
- What are you doing?

05:29.650 --> 05:31.499
- Send his ass to jail!
- Watch the equipment.

05:31.523 --> 05:33.727
- Let's go! Let's go! Get moving! Good.
- Okay. All right, make a path! Make a path!

05:33.751 --> 05:34.999
- Back up! Make a way!
- Come on! Come on!

05:35.023 --> 05:36.325
- Hey, calm down! Calm down! Calm down.
- I gotta go with my boy!

05:36.348 --> 05:37.741
Coming through!

05:37.764 --> 05:39.302
All right, people, let's move!

05:39.326 --> 05:41.692
Male, 40s, sever puncture
wounds to the lower flanks,

05:41.716 --> 05:42.908
severe bleeding, possible brain trauma.

05:42.932 --> 05:44.565
- Man's a champ! Saved my...
- Yeah, sit back, sir.

05:44.589 --> 05:46.982
Okay, hang 2 units of O-neg
and send off a trauma panel.

05:47.006 --> 05:48.763
Mollie, bring him to
Trauma 4 and notify C.T.

05:48.787 --> 05:50.942
- Shane? How is he?
- Yeah, still talking.

05:50.966 --> 05:52.742
Female, 40s, deep leg lac, stable.

05:52.766 --> 05:55.141
Hey, nice work, Drew. Curtain
1. Let's get Shane taken care of.

05:55.165 --> 05:56.486
- Someone's feeling energetic.
- Yeah, you know,

05:56.510 --> 05:57.606
you're out in the field,
you're always up, right?

05:57.630 --> 05:59.014
Tee, I'm sorry to pull you off your case.

05:59.038 --> 06:00.348
- I need you on incoming.
- Okay.

06:00.382 --> 06:01.883
Okay, Jordan, you're
with Drew on the cowboy.

06:01.907 --> 06:02.909
- Got it.
- Catch you later, Jordan.

06:02.933 --> 06:04.787
Hey, enjoy that rodeo vic.
He's a real piece of work.

06:04.811 --> 06:06.985
What's up? Scott got in an accident.

06:07.009 --> 06:08.192
- I need you to step in.
- Male, 20s,

06:08.216 --> 06:10.342
blunt chest trauma from
M.V.A., tachy and hypotensive.

06:10.366 --> 06:11.621
Flail chest, probable hemothorax.

06:11.645 --> 06:12.838
Trauma for a chest
tube, then up to the O.R.

06:12.862 --> 06:15.132
- Okay, Tee, go.
- No, no, no! This is my patient!

06:15.166 --> 06:17.029
- No, I'm...
- Wait, Scott! Scott! The police called.

06:17.053 --> 06:18.364
You were <i> in</i> that accident.

06:18.398 --> 06:19.845
Yes, I was, but I'm fine. Topher, I'm fine.

06:19.869 --> 06:21.542
Okay, well, you're gonna
have to answer some questions.

06:21.566 --> 06:23.174
I mean, they need you to take a drug test.

06:23.198 --> 06:25.286
- What happened out there?
- I-I don't can we talk about it later?

06:25.310 --> 06:26.824
No. Okay, fine,

06:26.848 --> 06:29.253
- but there's no way I can let you work on that kid.
- Look, there's no time for this!

06:29.277 --> 06:30.630
The kid needs me in there right now!

06:30.654 --> 06:32.028
Well, not until we check you out.

06:32.061 --> 06:33.253
We gotta make sure there's no brain trauma.

06:33.277 --> 06:34.458
My name is Scott Clemmens.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.662
- Z, y, x, w, v, u, t.
- Scott...

06:36.686 --> 06:38.503
It is Tuesday night at 8:30 P.M.

06:38.527 --> 06:41.628
- That boy's blood pressure is 82 over 42 and falling fast.
- Okay.

06:41.661 --> 06:42.844
I am the on-call surgeon,

06:42.878 --> 06:44.134
and if you don't let me in there right now

06:44.158 --> 06:46.021
to drain the blood from
his chest, he's gonna die.

06:46.045 --> 06:47.740
Okay, look, T.C. can get it started.

06:47.764 --> 06:49.522
We can call around for
another thoracic surgeon.

06:49.546 --> 06:51.825
Oh, come on! Just...

06:51.849 --> 06:54.867
Do the neuro, clear me,
and let me get into surgery.

06:54.891 --> 06:56.401
Scott, even if...

06:56.991 --> 06:59.006
The... the family has called the hospital.

06:59.037 --> 07:01.051
They don't want you
anywhere near their son.

07:01.213 --> 07:04.260
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to sit this one out.

07:04.284 --> 07:05.757
Well, actually, you know,

07:05.781 --> 07:07.860
it's not as dangerous
as people think it is.

07:07.884 --> 07:09.673
- Bandage, please.
- Ain't no rules, no nothing.

07:09.697 --> 07:10.885
You know oh!

07:10.909 --> 07:13.148
You're hotter than a summer revival.

07:13.181 --> 07:13.922
Amen.

07:13.946 --> 07:15.645
Easy there, cowboy.
She's already spoken for.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.395
Man's gotta speak his mind.

07:17.419 --> 07:18.551
Hey, you better speak it quieter.

07:18.575 --> 07:20.550
- Your girlfriend's in the next room.
- Yeah. How is she?

07:20.574 --> 07:22.011
- She's good.
- All right.

07:22.046 --> 07:23.421
I sutured the wound, but he's still tachy.

07:23.445 --> 07:25.555
Blood infusion could help.
What about his X-rays?

07:25.610 --> 07:28.201
- Uh, they're right over there. They look normal to me.
- Okay.

07:28.225 --> 07:29.983
Where's Dr. Superman at?

07:30.007 --> 07:31.460
I need to give him a hug.

07:31.484 --> 07:33.738
I'd be feedin' the worms
if he hadn't come along.

07:33.762 --> 07:35.027
Talking about T.C.

07:35.051 --> 07:38.652
Oh, boy, talk about cojones.
He nearly gave up the ghost.

07:38.686 --> 07:41.596
- I'm sorry. What?
- You know, died.

07:41.629 --> 07:44.594
This giant silver thingamabob,
sharper than a spur,

07:44.618 --> 07:47.181
- it came down about this close to his neck.
- Is that true?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.999
I guess. I don't know. I mean, I was...

07:51.023 --> 07:52.394
- came in from a bad angle.
- Drew.

07:52.418 --> 07:53.862
Bad angle? What are you talking about?

07:53.886 --> 07:55.782
This thing, it would've cut his
head, I swear to God. All right!

07:55.806 --> 07:57.618
Come down and
punctured him! It was right there!

07:57.619 --> 07:59.297
- Sir, just breathe deep.

07:59.321 --> 08:01.765
- Drew?
- Blood would've been everywhere. I was sittin' right next to him.

08:01.789 --> 08:03.707
- Does this hurt?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:03.731 --> 08:05.361
- All right, what about here?
- Mnh-mnh.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.439
Ow!

08:06.463 --> 08:07.738
How long have you had this pain?

08:07.762 --> 08:09.574
A-about a week.

08:09.598 --> 08:10.922
At first, I thought it was just cramps,

08:10.946 --> 08:12.958
but then I got a fever.

08:12.982 --> 08:15.348
Uh, where are your parents? We
need their consent for tests.

08:15.372 --> 08:17.573
My dad's driving in from Dallas.
He had to go there for work.

08:17.597 --> 08:19.259
But you can reach him on his cell.

08:19.294 --> 08:21.899
Does this mean I'm gonna
have to miss volleyball?

08:21.923 --> 08:23.202
I gotta get my practice time.

08:23.226 --> 08:24.580
Uh, what are you in? Eighth grade?

08:24.604 --> 08:26.811
Ninth grade. I'm a freshman.

08:26.835 --> 08:29.296
I play J.V., but I'm
first alternate on varsity.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.775
Wow. Is that how you,
uh, sprained your wrist?

08:31.799 --> 08:33.991
No. Carpal tunnel.

08:34.015 --> 08:35.994
My dad says I text too much.

08:37.296 --> 08:39.611
I-I see you had your appendix taken out.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.851
Yeah, right here.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.140
Still kinda hurts.

08:43.164 --> 08:45.635
Uh, do you remember who your surgeon was?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.422
Dr. Bell-Hart.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.244
- Krista, hold on for a sec.
- Hey.

08:50.268 --> 08:52.736
Hey, I'm doing a surgical
consult on Catherine Redding.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.234
- Uh, she was your...
- My appy patient.

08:54.258 --> 08:56.146
Yeah. She's a sweet
girl. What's she in for?

08:56.170 --> 08:58.504
Abdominal pain and fever. It
could be post-op complications.

08:58.528 --> 09:00.958
- Who was your attending?
- It was Joey, but he let me drive the whole way.

09:00.982 --> 09:03.029
So you counted lap pads?
Irrigated before closing?

09:03.144 --> 09:04.326
You think I screwed up?

09:04.350 --> 09:05.821
You know it could've
been any number of things.

09:05.845 --> 09:06.945
I mean, did you even check?

09:06.969 --> 09:09.535
Of course. I'm still ordering
a C.T. just to be safe.

09:09.789 --> 09:11.580
She's 14 years old,

09:11.613 --> 09:13.248
and you're about to
give her more radiation?

09:13.272 --> 09:16.390
Okay, uh... We'll do an
ultrasound and run labs.

09:16.414 --> 09:17.687
But you better be right,

09:17.711 --> 09:19.181
because if something else happens to her,

09:19.205 --> 09:21.139
this will be on you.

09:23.824 --> 09:25.607
- How's he doing?
- Touch and go.

09:25.630 --> 09:26.888
We stabilized him for surgery.

09:26.912 --> 09:28.836
I heard Scott plowed
into him. Is that true?

09:28.860 --> 09:30.105
Scott doesn't know how it happened.

09:30.129 --> 09:31.664
The police are on their
way. They wanna talk to him.

09:31.688 --> 09:32.838
Oh, that's never good.

09:32.862 --> 09:34.203
Hope for his sake he wasn't responsible.

09:34.227 --> 09:36.306
- Pulse ox is down to 80.
- Okay.

09:36.330 --> 09:37.542
Second tube is in.

09:37.566 --> 09:39.235
Whoa! Geez!

09:39.259 --> 09:40.562
He's gonna bleed out. Give me gloves.

09:40.586 --> 09:42.352
- I'm losing his pulse.
- Heart rate's up to 170.

09:42.376 --> 09:43.782
I'm cracking his chest.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.844
Aorta is clamped. Paddles.

09:50.868 --> 09:53.298
Clear.

09:53.991 --> 09:55.205
Still nothing.

09:55.239 --> 09:56.610
- Increase to 30 Joules.
- Okay.

09:56.634 --> 09:58.818
Ready? Clear.

10:02.919 --> 10:04.614
It's beating. That was close.

10:04.647 --> 10:05.989
Pulse is strong.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.280
Let's pack him, get him up to surgery.

10:07.304 --> 10:09.318
- You want me to scrub in?
- No, I can get started.

10:09.351 --> 10:10.597
All right, now most of all,

10:10.632 --> 10:12.111
I need you to convince the
dad to let Scott up there.

10:12.135 --> 10:14.277
- All right.
- Let me get into it. All right.

10:16.135 --> 10:17.893
All right.

10:17.927 --> 10:19.878
Now we gave him something for the pain.

10:19.902 --> 10:21.172
Okay?

10:21.224 --> 10:23.261
This is for you. Okay.

10:24.807 --> 10:26.629
The quietest I've ever seen him.

10:27.224 --> 10:28.501
How's he doin'?

10:28.525 --> 10:29.707
Well, his hip is healing fine,

10:29.731 --> 10:31.704
but we're having trouble
getting his heart rate down.

10:31.728 --> 10:34.447
Did he have a history with drugs? Alcohol?

10:34.471 --> 10:36.645
Oh. Yeah, he used to drink a ton.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.597
It's the one thing about him that I fixed.

10:38.631 --> 10:40.453
Well, he is quite the character.

10:40.487 --> 10:43.014
Ooh, he talks a lot and flirts,

10:43.047 --> 10:45.054
skirts death on a daily basis.

10:45.078 --> 10:47.344
He's been that way since I've known him.

10:47.368 --> 10:48.960
Yeah? Does he still ride bulls?

10:48.984 --> 10:51.343
Oh. No, not on the rodeo
circuit. They made him quit.

10:51.367 --> 10:52.933
So what does he do in the rodeo?

10:52.967 --> 10:54.694
Nearly gets himself killed.

10:54.727 --> 10:56.710
Steer wrestlin', barrel racin'.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.661
The crowd loves it. We're a team.

10:58.695 --> 11:01.541
I'm retired, but now I call out the acts,

11:01.575 --> 11:03.141
and he does his thing.

11:03.175 --> 11:05.135
- And you're okay with that?
- If you take that away,

11:05.159 --> 11:07.397
he wouldn't be the man I
fell in love with, would he?

11:07.431 --> 11:09.925
Oh, he'd be dead inside without it.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.264
How long have you two been together?

11:11.288 --> 11:13.270
Oh, my goodness.

11:13.294 --> 11:14.908
Too long, I suppose.

11:15.911 --> 11:17.126
Oh, we don't have any rings.

11:17.159 --> 11:18.790
We never thought to make it official.

11:18.823 --> 11:22.373
No kids, though we did talk
about it from time to time.

11:22.407 --> 11:24.509
Seems like a... Sweet guy.

11:24.533 --> 11:26.811
I'm sure he would've been a great dad.

11:28.363 --> 11:30.761
Yeah, his heart's in the right place.

11:30.785 --> 11:33.855
He just never was daddy material.

11:33.879 --> 11:35.830
You know, I'm not the
smartest woman in the world,

11:35.854 --> 11:38.235
but I wasn't dumb enough
to get knocked up by a man

11:38.259 --> 11:42.021
who couldn't think past his next bull ride.

11:44.397 --> 11:45.886
Okay.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.586
E-excuse me.

11:52.418 --> 11:53.664
You almost died out there.

11:53.688 --> 11:55.126
Yeah. It was really
something, huh?

11:55.150 --> 11:56.481
I haven't felt that way since, uh...

11:56.505 --> 11:58.339
Yeah, getting shot at and missed.
It's great.

11:58.363 --> 12:00.025
Kinda makes you see everything
in a whole new light.

12:00.049 --> 12:02.192
Yeah? So what are you seeing?

12:02.216 --> 12:04.618
Aw, you
know, just how confused I am.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.655
You know, my... my life's changing so much.

12:06.679 --> 12:08.597
I feel bad for Jordan.

12:08.621 --> 12:10.507
You know, I just... I feel stupid for...

12:10.531 --> 12:11.900
for holding back, for not going all in.

12:11.924 --> 12:14.130
Oh, no, no. You went all
in. You got her pregnant.

12:14.154 --> 12:15.528
Yeah.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.086
Yeah, but she needs more than that from me.

12:17.110 --> 12:19.539
You know, I thought I'd be
okay by now, but after...

12:19.563 --> 12:21.641
Breakdown in group and...

12:23.191 --> 12:25.732
Look, having a baby is... is great.

12:25.756 --> 12:27.354
It's exciting. I'm excited.

12:27.378 --> 12:28.688
But?

12:28.712 --> 12:30.982
It just feels like I have to
get things together faster.

12:31.006 --> 12:33.134
I mean, I have to I have to be able

12:33.158 --> 12:34.885
to fix things in my head quicker

12:34.918 --> 12:36.543
- than if we weren't having a kid, you know?
- Yeah.

12:36.567 --> 12:38.146
Lot of added pressure.

12:38.170 --> 12:39.862
- Yeah? And what does Jordan have to say?
- I haven't told her.

12:39.886 --> 12:41.562
- Why?
- W-why?

12:41.587 --> 12:42.957
Because I'm...
I don't know what to say.

12:42.981 --> 12:44.557
You know, it's all kinda
swirling around in my head.

12:44.581 --> 12:45.496
And...

12:45.520 --> 12:46.485
You know, I don't wanna hurt her.

12:46.509 --> 12:48.149
I don't want her to feel like
it's anything to do with her,

12:48.173 --> 12:49.778
'cause it's not. It's all me.

12:49.801 --> 12:51.596
- But not telling her's worse.
- Uh...

12:51.620 --> 12:53.282
Dr. Callahan, the patient's ready now.

12:53.863 --> 12:55.621
All right. Patient's ready.

12:55.645 --> 12:56.930
- Lucky you.
- Mm-hmm.

12:56.954 --> 12:58.016
Yeah.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.200
- I got witnesses he hit my boy. Now you're telling me...
- I understand.

13:00.224 --> 13:02.032
- I-I know this is hard, Mr. Johnson.
- That he's the best man for this job?

13:02.056 --> 13:04.196
- You don't know nothin'! What you talking about?
- Look, Dr. Clemmens...

13:04.220 --> 13:07.252
- is our most qualified surgeon, especially with this...
- Mr. Johnson?

13:07.276 --> 13:09.890
- Type of... Scott, this is not a good time.
- What the hell are you doing here?

13:09.914 --> 13:12.085
- Take another step closer!
- Please! If you want your boy to live,

13:12.109 --> 13:13.051
you'll let me do this operation.

13:13.075 --> 13:15.351
- You're not touching my boy.
- Just let me say my piece, please.

13:15.375 --> 13:18.311
Sir, Malik's lung is badly injured,

13:18.335 --> 13:20.349
and several ribs are
detached from his chest.

13:20.373 --> 13:21.616
We need to repair the lung

13:21.640 --> 13:23.365
and put his chest wall back together.

13:23.389 --> 13:25.465
No one can do that like I can.

13:25.582 --> 13:28.106
Believe me, Mr. Johnson, there
is nobody in this hospital...

13:28.130 --> 13:30.464
nobody wants your boy
to live more than I do.

13:30.488 --> 13:31.549
Oh, is that right?

13:31.573 --> 13:33.987
More than me? More than his family?

13:34.011 --> 13:36.310
- No, what I meant...
- I know what you meant!

13:36.334 --> 13:39.322
You meant that you're guilty. You hit him.

13:39.346 --> 13:42.200
So you go in there and
you better go fix my boy.

13:42.224 --> 13:44.896
That's right, 'cause if you
don't, I'm gonna sue you,

13:44.920 --> 13:46.582
and I'm gonna see your ass rot in jail.

13:46.606 --> 13:47.885
Okay, we'll fix it.

13:47.909 --> 13:49.987
Okay, go scrub in for
surgery. I'll call legal.

13:50.011 --> 13:51.193
Yeah.

13:52.571 --> 13:54.665
Don't say nothin' to me!
Don't say nothin' to me.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.562
All right.

14:03.586 --> 14:05.575
No sign of gallstones. Could be viral.

14:05.599 --> 14:07.005
Or a
drug-resistant peritonitis.

14:07.029 --> 14:08.452
Did you sterilize your instruments?

14:08.476 --> 14:09.770
No, I spat on them Paul. What do you think?

14:09.794 --> 14:11.403
I think there's a giant neon
sign on this girl that says

14:11.427 --> 14:13.921
- mistakes were made during surgery.
- Oh, a few weeks into your rotation,

14:13.945 --> 14:15.689
you're suddenly the expert
on surgical mistakes.

14:15.713 --> 14:17.847
- You're not your dad.
- Gee, thank you for the reminder.

14:17.871 --> 14:19.245
You know, maybe if you
focused more on surgery

14:19.269 --> 14:20.559
a little bit more than Joey's ass,

14:20.583 --> 14:21.964
- this girl wouldn't be back in here.
- You don't...

14:21.988 --> 14:23.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I get this crap at home.

14:23.171 --> 14:25.089
I don't need it here.
What the hell's going on?

14:25.113 --> 14:27.379
We were just... disagreeing
on the differential.

14:27.403 --> 14:29.528
You guys are on the same team.

14:29.698 --> 14:31.734
Sorry. We... we'll work together.

14:31.758 --> 14:32.884
See that you do.

14:32.908 --> 14:35.248
Just run your tests and
then report back to me.

14:35.272 --> 14:37.112
- All right. Thank you. Thank you.
- All right.

14:37.305 --> 14:38.552
Nice job.

14:38.576 --> 14:40.034
Really? You're blaming me?

14:40.058 --> 14:41.880
- Yeah.
- Yeah, don't worry. I'll solve this.

14:41.904 --> 14:43.534
Right.

14:43.808 --> 14:45.607
Any word on Scott?

14:45.631 --> 14:47.736
Okay, the rumor mill? It is in full force.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.927
Yeah. You know, was it his fault?

14:48.951 --> 14:50.165
- Wasn't it his fault?
- Right.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.499
I can't imagine what he's going through.

14:51.523 --> 14:53.793
Yeah, my buddy on the force
said he might be facing charges.

14:53.817 --> 14:54.958
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:54.982 --> 14:56.303
- Hey, I'll see you later?
- Yeah.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.008
- Jordan.
- Yeah?

14:58.032 --> 14:59.941
Fresh off the scan Shane's heart echo.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.317
- It's weird. His ejection fraction is way down.
- Hello, ma'am.

15:02.341 --> 15:04.475
- I'm Dr. Beckman.
- You think this is weird? Look at that.

15:04.498 --> 15:06.999
I hate to be the one to
deliver this news to you, ma'am,

15:07.023 --> 15:09.261
but you have lupus, and...

15:09.285 --> 15:11.105
- Maybe the herpes.
- Shane?

15:11.129 --> 15:13.540
- I'm here for my bunion.
- I understand, ma'am.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.511
- Shane, what is going on?
- I'm sorry. He's not a doctor. I apologize.

15:15.535 --> 15:16.878
What do you mean I'm not a doctor?

15:16.902 --> 15:19.331
- You don't think I know who I am?
- Baby, this is not funny.

15:19.355 --> 15:21.756
- Yeah, stop fooling around.
- No, but my name's Dr. Beckman.

15:22.214 --> 15:23.797
- I sincerely apologize.
- And this... this... this woman here,

15:23.821 --> 15:25.933
she's in serious troub...

15:25.956 --> 15:28.585
- Let's get you back... Drew!
- Oh, my God!

15:30.669 --> 15:32.091
- Baby!
- Let's get him on his side.

15:32.115 --> 15:33.088
Shane!

15:33.112 --> 15:35.384
Somebody get a gurney, please.

15:35.408 --> 15:37.508
You gotta help him!

15:40.449 --> 15:42.207
Okay.

15:42.539 --> 15:44.265
You see there?

15:44.289 --> 15:46.751
Now Shane's bleeding is caused
by dilated veins in his throat

15:46.786 --> 15:48.319
called varices.

15:48.343 --> 15:50.512
They can be caused by alcoholism.

15:50.536 --> 15:53.248
It is possible that he
never stopped drinking?

15:53.665 --> 15:54.816
No, I believe he quit.

15:54.849 --> 15:57.055
I mean, he makes things
up, but he's not a liar.

15:57.090 --> 15:59.391
Well, did he ever have
a psychiatric evaluation?

15:59.425 --> 16:01.055
No. Not since I've known him.

16:01.089 --> 16:03.231
- Okay.
- Listen, I know how people talk,

16:03.265 --> 16:04.585
and I know that he can be boastful,

16:04.609 --> 16:05.919
but that is...

16:05.953 --> 16:08.447
That's just part of being
in the rodeo, you know?

16:08.481 --> 16:11.103
And stretching the truth's
just part of the charm.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.895
Well...

16:12.929 --> 16:16.831
Pretending to be a doctor
is a step beyond boastful.

16:16.865 --> 16:19.615
Yeah. That did kind of freak me out.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.215
Yeah. You just hang tight, okay?

16:23.169 --> 16:26.559
Wait, in... in which case,
liability is <i> unlimited?</i>

16:26.593 --> 16:27.904
That...

16:27.927 --> 16:29.398
Hold... hold on a second.

16:29.441 --> 16:31.049
- What is it, Michael?
- You have visitors.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.932
They say they've been waiting a long time.

16:32.956 --> 16:34.825
Greg, I gotta... I gotta
call you back. Okay.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.197
- They want more than a drug test, don't they?
- Yeah.

16:38.221 --> 16:40.362
And I overheard them talking
about pressing charges

16:40.386 --> 16:41.632
for reckless driving.

16:43.183 --> 16:45.129
Okay. Uh... stall them.

16:45.153 --> 16:46.879
What? What do you mean "stall them"?

16:46.913 --> 16:48.639
- What do I say?
- Tell them the truth.

16:48.673 --> 16:51.034
Tell them the kid is critical,
and I'm talking to Scott now.

16:56.769 --> 16:58.751
Pulse ox is holding at 91%.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.127
Fine job stopping the bleeding.

17:00.161 --> 17:02.112
Had to take out half a lung to do it.

17:02.145 --> 17:03.425
Stabilize the rib while I drill?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.535
Yeah. Go ahead.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.780
Guy, I hate to have to do this.

17:09.804 --> 17:11.368
Scott, I need you to
come downstairs with me.

17:11.393 --> 17:13.294
- You gotta be kidding me.
- What the hell's going on?

17:13.318 --> 17:14.696
Tee, please just take over.

17:14.721 --> 17:17.119
Are you insane? The boy
has a hole in his chest.

17:17.153 --> 17:19.565
Y-you think I wanna do this?
The police are downstairs.

17:19.589 --> 17:20.719
Well, the police can wait.

17:20.742 --> 17:22.232
Let me give you a reality check, Scott.

17:22.256 --> 17:24.430
They're talking about
filing charges down there.

17:24.637 --> 17:26.715
That's right. Take the damn drug test.

17:26.740 --> 17:28.905
No, I'm not leaving the
kid. We need one more hour,

17:28.929 --> 17:30.089
and then they can do what they want.

17:30.113 --> 17:31.965
- Give him the hour, Toph.
- One hour.

17:31.989 --> 17:34.324
I don't know that I can, but I'll try.

17:34.529 --> 17:35.807
You okay?

17:35.841 --> 17:38.143
Do I have a choice?

17:38.177 --> 17:39.327
Stabilize the rib.

17:39.361 --> 17:40.770
Got it.

17:44.449 --> 17:46.335
You really cried watching "Finding Nemo"?

17:46.369 --> 17:48.831
Oh, my God. Like a freakin' baby.

17:48.865 --> 17:51.231
I mean, his mom gets
killed the first minute.

17:51.265 --> 17:53.695
Are you serious? Who put
that in a kid's movie?

17:53.729 --> 17:56.041
I'm freakin' almost tearing
up thinking about it right now.

17:56.065 --> 17:57.567
Stupid-ass barracuda.

17:57.601 --> 17:59.071
I was surprised it got you.

17:59.105 --> 18:01.631
Why do you always say stuff like that?

18:01.665 --> 18:02.751
Like what?

18:02.785 --> 18:04.799
Like you're always
surprised that I feel this

18:04.833 --> 18:06.047
or that I feel...

18:06.081 --> 18:07.583
Basically, that I show my feelings.

18:07.617 --> 18:09.929
- That I'm open.
- I... I'm just giving you crap. Whatever.

18:09.953 --> 18:11.369
You're a guy. I'm not
used to that from guys.

18:11.393 --> 18:13.024
Okay, what are you used to in guys?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.593
Well, you know that I've dated,
like, 10,000, so let me see...

18:15.617 --> 18:18.015
Ahh. There we go. I
remember this.

18:18.049 --> 18:20.511
We're deflecting again.
You know, you do that a lot.

18:20.545 --> 18:23.037
Okay, so I'm always...

18:23.061 --> 18:25.171
Surprised by you and I always deflect.

18:25.195 --> 18:27.213
Is there anything else
you'd like to comment on?

18:27.237 --> 18:29.347
Look, I'm not putting you
down. We're just talking.

18:29.371 --> 18:31.529
Mm-hmm. We just... we're
having casual conversation.

18:31.553 --> 18:32.830
Yo, listen, I-I deflect, too.

18:32.854 --> 18:35.625
I-I have the fake laugh I
do when I don't wanna talk.

18:35.649 --> 18:37.023
You know what I'm talking
about, when I don't want to talk.

18:37.047 --> 18:39.509
No, that's... I-it's not
that I don't wanna talk.

18:39.533 --> 18:40.683
It's just, I don't want to talk about that.

18:40.707 --> 18:43.073
The men in my past? No, don't do that.

18:44.783 --> 18:45.934
Okay.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.733
We'll... we'll talk about something else.

18:47.756 --> 18:49.811
We're here.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.167
Ow! My back! Oh, my God!

18:55.201 --> 18:56.806
- My back! My back!
- Make room here.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.375
- Oh! Oh! Ah!
- All right, everybody, back up.

18:58.399 --> 19:00.025
I fell off the roof. There's no railing.

19:00.048 --> 19:01.767
Okay, let me go get the backboard.

19:01.791 --> 19:02.877
- And get me a painkiller!
- Yep.

19:02.901 --> 19:04.389
Hold up. Hold up. Hold on.

19:04.413 --> 19:07.131
Okay, who saw this man fall?

19:07.155 --> 19:08.497
Anybody?

19:08.521 --> 19:09.735
Uh...

19:09.759 --> 19:12.092
Who... who actually saw it??

19:12.116 --> 19:14.290
You? You didn't see anything, huh?

19:14.314 --> 19:16.284
No. I didn't think so.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.335
Get the hell up.

19:18.369 --> 19:20.287
I-I can't even move, man.

19:20.311 --> 19:21.302
I can't move.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.667
Get up, Sean.

19:22.691 --> 19:24.118
Wait. You know him?

19:24.141 --> 19:25.643
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

19:25.667 --> 19:27.810
Every come of months, he
takes a ride to the E.R.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.096
And every time, it's the same
story... fell off the roof.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.745
And every time, he just wants more Oxy.

19:34.209 --> 19:35.359
Come on. On your feet, Sean.

19:35.393 --> 19:38.655
Aw, man! Yeah. There we go.

19:38.689 --> 19:40.959
Come on, Kenny. Damn, man.

19:40.993 --> 19:43.807
Aw, man. That sucks, huh?

19:43.841 --> 19:45.919
Have a nice night.

19:45.953 --> 19:47.327
Nicely done.

19:47.361 --> 19:49.785
I got a few moves.

19:58.793 --> 20:00.250
- Uh, look, Krista...
- You know what?

20:00.274 --> 20:01.410
I-I don't think we should
talk about anything

20:01.434 --> 20:02.580
other than the case right now, Paul.

20:02.604 --> 20:04.631
Okay. All right. Well, um...

20:04.655 --> 20:06.532
Let's, uh, review what we have here.

20:06.556 --> 20:08.222
It's a weird collection of symptoms.

20:08.246 --> 20:09.210
Uh, inflamed pancreas.

20:09.234 --> 20:10.504
Pleural effusions.

20:10.528 --> 20:11.654
Trouble breathing.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.049
Increasing pain.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.652
All in a 14-year-old girl.

20:20.409 --> 20:21.696
Catherine's on the J.V. squad, right?

20:21.720 --> 20:22.814
Uh, yeah.

20:22.838 --> 20:25.123
But she's pissed she's not on varsity.

20:25.147 --> 20:26.467
And she wants a scholarship to college.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.390
I mean, what if she's
trying to impress her dad?

20:28.623 --> 20:31.004
Yeah. It wouldn't be the first time.

20:31.039 --> 20:32.776
That's our answer.

20:32.811 --> 20:35.485
Her carpal tunnel isn't
from texting, is it?

20:35.509 --> 20:36.732
We need a hormone panel.

20:36.756 --> 20:38.671
Yeah. Come on.

20:38.695 --> 20:40.410
Let me make this as clear as I can.

20:40.434 --> 20:42.741
If you pull Scott
Clemmens from this surgery,

20:42.765 --> 20:44.245
you are endangering this boy's life.

20:44.271 --> 20:45.944
We were told there's
another doctor up there.

20:45.968 --> 20:47.245
You're a doctor. You can replace him.

20:47.269 --> 20:48.497
No, it doesn't work that way.

20:48.531 --> 20:50.236
Scott Clemmens is our on-call surgeon.

20:50.271 --> 20:51.429
I just spoke with Scott.

20:51.462 --> 20:52.985
They just need one more hour up there.

20:53.009 --> 20:54.360
They have a warrant, Topher.

20:54.394 --> 20:55.723
We just got a bystander
video from the accident.

20:55.747 --> 20:57.678
This will change your mind.

21:04.670 --> 21:07.825
He ran right through that stop sign.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.560
B.P.'s down to 74 systolic.

21:13.594 --> 21:14.784
Something's wrong.

21:14.818 --> 21:16.491
It's not just a bleed.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.876
Scott, we got company.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.326
Guys, I did what I could.

21:19.360 --> 21:20.623
I said we needed more time.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.642
They have you on video, Scott.

21:23.881 --> 21:26.272
Scott Clemmens. San Antonio Police.

21:26.296 --> 21:27.696
You need to come with us right now.

21:38.027 --> 21:39.314
I'll be back.

21:39.349 --> 21:40.507
Okay. Yeah.

21:44.310 --> 21:46.595
Dr. Callahan, what should we do?

21:46.630 --> 21:49.333
Let's just hope he passes that test.

21:49.368 --> 21:52.138
I can't breathe. I can't keep my breath.

21:52.162 --> 21:54.382
- It's okay. Just breathe.
- I'm trying.

21:54.406 --> 21:58.073
There she is. My wild Texas Rose.

21:58.097 --> 22:00.608
Hi, Shane. How you feeling?

22:00.633 --> 22:02.905
He's gettin' weaker. I
never seen him this bad.

22:02.929 --> 22:06.181
I'm all stove up, ready for the big dance.

22:06.216 --> 22:07.631
Shane, don't talk like that.

22:07.665 --> 22:10.176
I been ready for some
time, baby. You know that.

22:10.210 --> 22:12.173
I'm at peace with the world.

22:12.207 --> 22:14.782
That's the delusions talking, isn't it?

22:14.816 --> 22:16.772
Doctor, isn't it?

22:17.104 --> 22:18.390
Please tell me that it is.

22:18.425 --> 22:21.096
I'm sorry. We have a few more
tests that we need to run.

22:21.130 --> 22:23.480
Um... Drew, can I speak with you outside?

22:23.514 --> 22:25.188
Yeah. Excuse me.

22:29.023 --> 22:31.437
I put in a swan. He's got a
little upper cardiac failure.

22:31.471 --> 22:32.790
I couldn't figure out the cause.

22:32.824 --> 22:34.530
Okay, what about the psychotic behavior?

22:34.556 --> 22:37.260
Comes and goes. Two minutes
ago, he was a Navy S.E.A.L.

22:37.302 --> 22:39.082
But it's weird 'cause he keeps
telling the same rodeo story,

22:39.106 --> 22:40.757
but it's got different
people in it each time.

22:40.781 --> 22:42.326
All right, let's run another scan.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.656
And could you please bring Lindsay out?

22:43.680 --> 22:44.849
I need to talk to her in private.

22:44.873 --> 22:46.223
- Yeah. Okay.
- Thank you.

22:50.896 --> 22:52.408
Any news from T.C.?

22:52.443 --> 22:54.323
Yeah, he's still in
surgery. Topher's assisting.

22:55.171 --> 22:56.550
How you holding up?

22:56.574 --> 22:58.153
How do you think I'm holding up, Michael?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.431
I'm getting drug tested.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.645
I didn't use anything. I didn't drink.

23:01.669 --> 23:03.439
Okay. Come on, let's have a seat.

23:07.969 --> 23:11.640
Okay.

23:13.703 --> 23:16.690
Did you... tell them what happened?

23:16.714 --> 23:19.838
Yes. Ten times.

23:20.114 --> 23:22.271
I was driving to the
clinic. I was running late.

23:22.304 --> 23:24.912
I looked down for, like, 2
seconds.<i> Maybe</i> 2 seconds.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.168
And the next thing I know,

23:26.203 --> 23:28.134
this kid's car is right in front of me.

23:30.069 --> 23:31.806
If anything happens to him...

23:31.840 --> 23:35.350
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on. We won't let it.

23:43.179 --> 23:45.272
Aren't we a mess tonight?

23:45.305 --> 23:46.850
Yeah.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.364
Yeah.

23:48.398 --> 23:49.501
How about this? How about this?

23:49.525 --> 23:51.338
How about we move away
from the awkward silences

23:51.362 --> 23:54.452
and, uh, try to guess what
the other person is feeling?

23:54.487 --> 23:56.192
Um...

23:56.226 --> 23:59.123
Give me a little space here.

24:02.573 --> 24:04.535
How about we talk about something

24:04.569 --> 24:06.733
that's really been bothering me?

24:06.757 --> 24:08.759
W-what?

24:10.817 --> 24:12.524
How gassy you are when you sleep.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.939
- I mean...
- I'm not gassy!

24:15.973 --> 24:17.592
I mean, but I didn't want
to say anything before,

24:17.616 --> 24:18.881
but it's like we've reached this point now

24:18.905 --> 24:20.523
- where I feel that we can talk about these things.
- No.

24:20.547 --> 24:21.716
We're at a plateau. Oh, my God.

24:21.740 --> 24:23.767
We can... we can
talk about these things.

24:23.793 --> 24:26.529
- I'm not!
- Uh, yes, you are. I mean, you done woke...

24:26.572 --> 24:29.466
- No, I'm not!
- You done woke me up outta some deep, sound sleep.

24:29.490 --> 24:32.475
- You are making this up!
- Dream state, okay?

24:32.499 --> 24:34.075
But I...

24:34.099 --> 24:35.342
Would... would I lie about
something this serious?

24:35.366 --> 24:37.356
- Unh-unh. Yes.
- I mean, this is a serious issue.

24:37.380 --> 24:38.667
Oh. Baby, it's like...

24:38.691 --> 24:40.268
it's like you're in a
hot... we're in a hotbox.

24:40.292 --> 24:42.642
It's like I'm in
a it's like I'm in a hotbox.

24:42.666 --> 24:45.682
- Is it a nice hotbox?
- I mean, it's like you got the child lock going.

24:45.706 --> 24:47.219
- I can't get out.
- You poor thing.

24:47.253 --> 24:48.128
I don't know where to go.

24:48.152 --> 24:49.600
I don't wanna go nowhere.
That's the important thing.

24:49.624 --> 24:51.265
I don't even wanna go nowhere.

24:51.289 --> 24:53.271
Gwen, we got a code 3 for chest pain.

24:53.296 --> 24:54.743
But, yeah,
we'll finish this later.

24:54.767 --> 24:56.376
- Oh, yes, we will.
- We're gonna finish it.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.378
The morning trumpets will be talked about.

25:02.540 --> 25:04.928
Okay, Shane's heart is
not pumping enough blood,

25:04.953 --> 25:06.754
and we're trying to figure out why.

25:06.778 --> 25:10.351
Has he had any mental changes before this?

25:10.375 --> 25:12.370
Oh, well, little slips here and there.

25:12.394 --> 25:14.488
I-I was afraid it might be Alzheimer's.

25:14.512 --> 25:17.023
Mm. Those are called confabulations.

25:17.047 --> 25:20.405
See, he's not forgetting.
He's making things up.

25:20.429 --> 25:22.482
You know, about his past, who he is.

25:22.506 --> 25:24.663
Might that have something
to do with his disease?

25:24.687 --> 25:25.959
It might.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.975
I know that he's had problems with alcohol,

25:27.999 --> 25:30.123
but... What about this diet?

25:30.147 --> 25:31.950
Shane is all about the protein.

25:32.036 --> 25:33.936
Rice and shrimp.

25:37.332 --> 25:38.972
Rice and shrimp and...

25:38.996 --> 25:40.084
That's it.

25:40.109 --> 25:42.889
No fruits or vegetables? Other meats?

25:42.913 --> 25:44.712
- Dairy?
- Oh! No. No.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.726
He hates greens. He's lactose-intolerant.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.034
But he love shrimp.

25:49.721 --> 25:51.231
Why? Does that mean something?

25:51.291 --> 25:53.701
You know, it just might. Um...

25:53.930 --> 25:55.986
I'm sorry. You'll have to excuse me.

26:02.694 --> 26:03.818
Hey.

26:04.807 --> 26:06.853
I'm Michael Ragosa.

26:06.877 --> 26:09.490
- Yeah, I thought I'd bring you s...
- How's Malik?

26:11.233 --> 26:13.962
He's, uh, he's still in critical condition.

26:17.929 --> 26:20.721
- But he's alive?
- Yeah.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.547
Yeah, we're doing everything we can.

26:22.572 --> 26:24.988
The damage to the lungs
was much more extensive

26:25.012 --> 26:26.135
than we thought.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.839
But Dr. Clemmens is gonna fix him, right?

26:29.228 --> 26:30.930
He's in good hands.

26:34.605 --> 26:38.204
My boy Malik is special.

26:38.411 --> 26:40.255
Now I know every parent
says that about their kid,

26:40.279 --> 26:41.341
but...

26:41.365 --> 26:43.701
Man, he's got something extra.

26:43.857 --> 26:45.418
I mean, I knew that since the first day

26:45.442 --> 26:47.047
I saw his big hands when he was born.

26:48.251 --> 26:49.502
He's a musician.

26:49.526 --> 26:50.638
Really?

26:50.662 --> 26:52.429
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, matter of fact...

26:52.453 --> 26:53.817
Check this out.

26:57.175 --> 26:59.578
- Ahh. All right. It's really good.
- Yeah!

26:59.602 --> 27:01.209
And all the instruments, that's him.

27:01.233 --> 27:03.128
Piano, guitar, that's all him.

27:03.152 --> 27:05.074
- Right.
- I mean, that's just him just messin' around.

27:05.098 --> 27:06.960
I mean, he's been like
that ever since he was 5.

27:06.984 --> 27:09.426
- Wow.
- Man, he's got a bright future.

27:10.915 --> 27:12.913
Brighter than I ever had.

27:16.358 --> 27:19.120
Why my son?

27:19.169 --> 27:21.008
Why my boy?

27:21.032 --> 27:22.445
I wish I knew.

27:30.946 --> 27:32.520
What'd you guys find?

27:32.544 --> 27:34.149
We tested your blood for hormone levels.

27:34.173 --> 27:36.678
We found high levels of growth hormones.

27:36.703 --> 27:37.729
Dangerously high.

27:37.753 --> 27:40.323
Catherine, you need to stop using it.

27:40.347 --> 27:41.696
It's killing you.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.680
You don't understand what it's like,

27:43.704 --> 27:45.290
trying to compete.

27:45.314 --> 27:47.024
If I stop now, I'm gone.

27:47.048 --> 27:50.068
No varsity team. No scholarship.

27:50.215 --> 27:52.655
That was
our whole plan. It...

27:52.679 --> 27:54.828
oh, my God.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.142
That's my dad. What am I gonna tell him?

27:57.166 --> 27:59.222
The truth. He's going to hear it from us.

27:59.246 --> 28:01.495
It's probably better if
he hears it from you first.

28:01.519 --> 28:03.028
So, how she doing?

28:03.052 --> 28:05.435
Uh, we'll let her tell you.

28:05.459 --> 28:07.271
I put a rush on Scott's blood test.

28:07.295 --> 28:09.476
- Well, how long?
- Not sure.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.781
Maybe an hour? I don't
think he has an hour.

28:11.805 --> 28:14.914
I mean, I can do it, but
I'm not as fast as Scott.

28:14.938 --> 28:17.225
We gotta do something. This
kid's not gonna make it.

28:17.249 --> 28:19.805
I have an idea. Let me go talk to Jordan.

28:19.829 --> 28:21.386
All right.

28:25.853 --> 28:27.300
- What's going on?
- Hey.

28:27.324 --> 28:28.489
I'm gonna ask you this once,

28:28.513 --> 28:29.935
and you are gonna tell me the truth.

28:29.959 --> 28:31.115
- Understand?
- We were...

28:31.139 --> 28:33.428
And I know what your mother means to you,

28:33.452 --> 28:36.409
so you swear on her life
that you did not have a drink

28:36.433 --> 28:37.781
or take anything.

28:37.805 --> 28:40.504
Jordan, you know that I haven't
had a drink in over 10 years.

28:40.528 --> 28:42.891
- I still go to meetings.
- Swear that when those results come back,

28:42.915 --> 28:44.562
- they will be negative.
- I swear.

28:44.586 --> 28:45.581
- For anything.
- Yes.

28:45.605 --> 28:48.046
- On your mother.
- On... My... Mother.

28:48.070 --> 28:49.342
What are you talking about?

28:49.659 --> 28:51.231
I'm talking about

28:51.256 --> 28:53.246
your test results will
take another 45 minutes...

28:53.270 --> 28:55.422
And Malik
does not have that time.

28:55.446 --> 28:58.305
So we are signing off on the results.

29:02.586 --> 29:04.417
You're you're faking them?

29:04.441 --> 29:07.365
No. We're just saying
that they're negative,

29:07.389 --> 29:10.450
which means we are all
going out on a limb for you.

29:10.474 --> 29:12.819
So I need to know that I can trust you

29:12.843 --> 29:15.983
when you say that those results
will be clean as a whistle.

29:16.007 --> 29:18.584
Because that's what
they're going to be, right?

29:21.294 --> 29:24.366
Yes. They will.

29:24.677 --> 29:26.443
Okay.

29:27.826 --> 29:29.857
All right.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.023
Heart's tachy to 158.

29:40.047 --> 29:41.781
B.P. only 64.

29:41.805 --> 29:43.379
You were right.
It's an air embolism.

29:43.403 --> 29:44.558
Yeah, already in the heart.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.353
That bubble reaches the
kid's coronary, he's dead.

29:46.377 --> 29:47.951
Increase O² to 100%.

29:48.715 --> 29:50.610
- I'm losing his pulse.
- Damn it.

29:50.634 --> 29:52.784
Okay, I can try to aspirate
the air from the atrium.

29:52.808 --> 29:54.147
But, uh, let's place the central line.

29:54.171 --> 29:56.796
No time for that. He'll be dead by then.

29:56.820 --> 29:57.879
So what do we do?

29:57.903 --> 29:59.187
We take it directly out of the heart.

29:59.211 --> 30:00.463
Have you done this before?

30:00.487 --> 30:03.181
Yes. Only about a dozen times.

30:11.405 --> 30:12.594
There is the embolism.

30:13.242 --> 30:14.247
You got it.

30:14.506 --> 30:17.013
Okay, this is Thiamine, or Vitamin B.

30:17.037 --> 30:18.797
Now your body doesn't have enough of it,

30:18.821 --> 30:20.543
and it hasn't in a long time.

30:20.567 --> 30:21.787
Okay, let's get your over on your side.

30:21.811 --> 30:23.397
Wait. That... that's it? A vitamin?

30:23.421 --> 30:26.151
Well, the deficiency has caused
Shane to suffer an illness

30:26.175 --> 30:27.702
called Korsakoff Psychosis.

30:27.727 --> 30:29.878
Now if severe,

30:29.903 --> 30:31.475
it can really mess with your heart.

30:31.499 --> 30:33.733
That and, well, you make things up.

30:33.757 --> 30:35.863
What are you talking about?
She's calling me a liar.

30:35.887 --> 30:37.511
You are one, Shane.

30:37.535 --> 30:39.864
Aah! Jesus!

30:39.888 --> 30:42.751
The good news is, it's reversible, okay.

30:42.775 --> 30:45.393
Regular Thiamine and a
diet other than just shrimp,

30:45.417 --> 30:47.674
and... No alcohol.

30:47.698 --> 30:51.779
A-alcohol? No, I-I, uh, I
don't take the drink. No, uh...

30:51.803 --> 30:54.397
- I know you tried, honey.
- I'm sorry.

30:54.421 --> 30:56.891
I think the best thing for Shane
right now would be some rest.

30:56.915 --> 30:58.391
I used to like you.

30:58.426 --> 31:00.449
All right.

31:04.942 --> 31:07.351
So the stories are gonna stop?

31:07.375 --> 31:09.430
No, his behavior won't stop right away.

31:09.454 --> 31:11.027
It might take a few months to clear up.

31:11.052 --> 31:12.400
And the thrill-seekin'?

31:12.424 --> 31:14.685
The risk-taking can be
part of the condition.

31:14.709 --> 31:16.408
Yeah, but that's who he is.

31:16.432 --> 31:18.026
He can't lose that light, can he?

31:18.050 --> 31:18.961
I don't know.

31:18.986 --> 31:21.358
I guess you're gonna find
out what was really Shane

31:21.382 --> 31:23.435
and what wasn't.

31:25.742 --> 31:26.897
Hey.

31:29.323 --> 31:31.528
Did you ever try to change him?

31:31.688 --> 31:34.282
Sure. In the beginning.

31:34.306 --> 31:35.815
But you know what?

31:35.850 --> 31:38.680
Eventually, you realize that
you love a man for his falls

31:38.704 --> 31:40.374
as much as his wins.

31:41.036 --> 31:42.812
Maybe even more.

31:45.194 --> 31:47.217
Yeah.

31:47.241 --> 31:48.751
It's complicated, isn't it?

31:48.775 --> 31:49.899
Mm-hmm.

31:49.923 --> 31:50.923
Mm-hmm.

31:55.719 --> 31:57.035
Hey, great save, Scott.

31:57.070 --> 31:58.836
Yeah. It was touch and go there.

31:58.870 --> 32:00.989
Yeah. Thanks for sticking up for me,

32:01.024 --> 32:02.468
accelerating those test results.

32:02.503 --> 32:04.527
You realize if you were lying...

32:04.560 --> 32:06.487
And something shows up... I wasn't lying.

32:06.521 --> 32:07.976
I'm gonna follow him down to post-op,

32:08.000 --> 32:09.133
make sure everything goes right.

32:09.157 --> 32:10.667
Okay.

32:11.987 --> 32:14.043
Wait, wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop!

32:14.977 --> 32:16.872
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:16.906 --> 32:19.252
So I saw Malik on the way to post-op.

32:19.286 --> 32:21.191
Looks like things went well.

32:21.371 --> 32:24.084
We'll see. Still not out of the woods.

32:24.108 --> 32:26.454
Yeah.

32:28.900 --> 32:30.957
I got your test results back.

32:33.082 --> 32:34.431
Totally clean.

32:35.060 --> 32:37.278
I told you.

32:37.468 --> 32:39.654
Look, I'm...

32:39.997 --> 32:42.311
I should've known that
you wouldn't lie to me,

32:42.346 --> 32:43.907
and I am sorry that I questioned you.

32:43.931 --> 32:44.959
You had to.

32:46.407 --> 32:47.756
But you stood by me.

32:47.780 --> 32:49.636
Yeah.

32:49.660 --> 32:51.427
You know, you stood by me enough.

32:51.451 --> 32:52.818
It's my turn.

33:14.265 --> 33:16.258
I'd say that was a success.

33:16.307 --> 33:17.537
Yeah, but I don't know

33:17.561 --> 33:18.717
if Catherine's gonna see it the same way.

33:18.741 --> 33:20.717
Her volleyball ambitions took a big hit.

33:20.742 --> 33:22.743
Well, as my father likes to say,

33:22.767 --> 33:24.985
life's full is sacrifices. Choose wisely.

33:25.224 --> 33:26.381
Um... Speaking of which,

33:26.405 --> 33:28.528
I just... I-I just wanna say I'm sorry

33:28.552 --> 33:30.706
about what I said earlier. Everything.

33:30.730 --> 33:32.576
I'm just...

33:32.892 --> 33:34.112
I'm competitive.

33:34.136 --> 33:36.915
Like, overly competitive.

33:38.119 --> 33:39.212
And I really wanna be chief resident

33:39.236 --> 33:40.424
in a couple years.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.411
Yeah, we both do.

33:44.870 --> 33:46.749
I-I don't want us to hate each other.

33:46.773 --> 33:48.605
Yeah, me, neither.

33:49.666 --> 33:51.981
We both went mean pretty quickly.

33:52.005 --> 33:53.531
We just have to find a way to stay friends

33:53.555 --> 33:55.012
during all of this, you know?

33:55.036 --> 33:56.450
Yeah, we do.

33:58.325 --> 34:00.414
So I guess we'll, uh, see how it goes then?

34:03.053 --> 34:04.112
Guess so.

34:04.185 --> 34:06.274
Okay.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.835
He should be coming out of
anesthesia any minute now.

34:17.860 --> 34:19.531
There you go.

34:19.554 --> 34:20.679
We got movement.

34:23.984 --> 34:25.462
Okay, Malik.

34:27.953 --> 34:30.235
Good.

34:30.585 --> 34:32.353
Pupils are reactive.

34:32.377 --> 34:35.929
There he is. That's my boy. Oh, thank God.

34:35.954 --> 34:38.590
Okay, Malik, I'm going to
ask you a few questions.

34:38.614 --> 34:40.002
I don't want to try and speak yet,

34:40.025 --> 34:43.563
but you can nod your head
"yes" or shake your head "no."

34:43.587 --> 34:46.076
Can you do that? Okay, good.

34:46.572 --> 34:49.589
You were in an accident.
Do you remember that?

34:51.444 --> 34:55.077
This man to the left here,
do you know who he is?

34:58.703 --> 35:01.565
There's my boy. He used to
tickle my hand...

35:01.589 --> 35:04.148
Wake me up when he was a baby.

35:04.341 --> 35:06.173
Thank you, doctor.

35:06.197 --> 35:07.321
Thank you.

35:07.947 --> 35:10.284
Kid's jumping the gun on us.

35:10.308 --> 35:11.752
We have arm movement.

35:11.776 --> 35:14.645
Okay, Malik, can you move
your other arm for me, please?

35:18.145 --> 35:19.816
Malik?

35:21.735 --> 35:23.728
Are you trying to move your other arm?

35:23.752 --> 35:24.972
Mm-hmm.

35:27.594 --> 35:29.088
Okay.

35:31.892 --> 35:33.402
Um...

35:33.426 --> 35:36.769
Malik, can you move your feet, please?

35:39.498 --> 35:40.880
Mnh-mnh.

35:40.904 --> 35:44.988
Malik, can you move your
toes? Just wiggle your toes.

35:45.012 --> 35:46.201
Can you do that?

35:49.449 --> 35:50.829
Can you feel this?

35:54.129 --> 35:56.604
Can you feel any of this, Malik?

35:56.773 --> 36:00.061
Come on, son. Move your leg.

36:00.085 --> 36:03.243
Move... move your arm. M-move your hand.

36:06.147 --> 36:07.535
You can't do that?

36:09.364 --> 36:11.353
There's...

36:11.377 --> 36:13.378
There's some cord damage,

36:13.402 --> 36:15.401
but that can be reversible.

36:15.426 --> 36:17.844
We can... we'll run some tests.

36:17.868 --> 36:19.892
- Scott.
- And there's...

36:19.916 --> 36:23.067
A lot of things... a lot of
reasons that... that can happen.

36:23.091 --> 36:25.349
So...

36:25.507 --> 36:27.375
So I can... I can help.

36:27.399 --> 36:29.681
Scott, step outside with me for a sec?

36:29.705 --> 36:31.859
Come on.

36:42.805 --> 36:44.412
It's okay, son.

36:45.618 --> 36:48.544
I'm right here. I'm...
I'm not going anywhere.

36:51.306 --> 36:54.102
Gotta say, not like I
didn't respect you before,

36:54.126 --> 36:55.282
because clearly I did,

36:55.306 --> 36:57.460
but after riding along with you tonight,

36:57.484 --> 36:59.605
I must say, you are something special.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.705
Not so bad yourself.

37:02.729 --> 37:04.239
Wait.

37:04.779 --> 37:06.206
Uh-oh. What's wrong?

37:11.323 --> 37:13.697
God, it's just that damn Nemo.

37:13.721 --> 37:15.553
You know?

37:15.577 --> 37:17.038
Gets me every time.

37:17.062 --> 37:18.475
Yeah, I get that, actually.

37:18.499 --> 37:21.648
- See? You and me both.
- Mm.

37:24.918 --> 37:26.612
Hey, Tee. You done changing?

37:26.636 --> 37:28.146
Yep. Just, uh...

37:29.286 --> 37:30.377
Tough surgery.

37:30.402 --> 37:31.719
- Yeah, I can imagine.
- Yeah.

37:31.743 --> 37:34.154
Hey, thank you for trusting Scott.

37:34.178 --> 37:36.331
Oh, I didn't... I didn't
trust Scott. I trusted you.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.186
Well, thank you for trusting me.

37:38.210 --> 37:39.914
I'll always trust you, you know,

37:39.938 --> 37:41.577
'cause I know you're trying to trust me.

37:41.601 --> 37:43.695
- I do trust you.
- Yeah?

37:43.719 --> 37:46.106
- Yeah.
- Yeah? You sure?

37:46.130 --> 37:48.130
Look, uh, I love you,

37:48.154 --> 37:50.018
and I love the baby, and...

37:50.042 --> 37:52.606
I'm just still struggling a little bit.

37:52.630 --> 37:53.882
You know? With... with... uh, I-I thought

37:53.906 --> 37:56.318
all this P.T.S.D. was
going away, and it hasn't.

37:56.343 --> 37:58.440
That sounds like progress to me.

38:00.532 --> 38:01.946
Look...

38:03.091 --> 38:05.116
For the record,

38:05.140 --> 38:07.985
the risks that you take, they scare me.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.260
But I <i> do</i> trust you.

38:10.284 --> 38:12.324
All right? It doesn't mean that I don't...

38:12.626 --> 38:14.549
Wanna smack you every once in a while.

38:14.573 --> 38:16.942
Hey, how did you not smack me all the time?

38:16.966 --> 38:18.204
- No, I did.
- Mm-hmm.

38:18.228 --> 38:21.090
- Mm-hmm.
- Look, when I figure this all out,

38:21.114 --> 38:22.528
it'll be good for you and me and the baby.

38:22.552 --> 38:24.705
The three of us. Promise.

38:24.730 --> 38:26.594
I know.

38:27.646 --> 38:29.376
- All right.
- All right.

38:29.400 --> 38:31.131
- I'll see you outside.
- Yep.

38:52.453 --> 38:54.384
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:54.409 --> 38:58.271
His M.R.I... what did it
show? Was it the surgery?

38:58.296 --> 39:00.994
No, it wasn't. Don't do this to yourself.

39:01.018 --> 39:04.136
When he coded, the upper
part of his spinal cord died.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.199
There was nothing you
or anybody could've done.

39:07.559 --> 39:09.268
You saved the boy's life, Scott.

39:09.292 --> 39:11.406
How can you say that?

39:11.713 --> 39:14.587
I changed his life forever.

39:15.416 --> 39:16.902
Forever.

39:18.472 --> 39:20.060
He's going
to be paralyzed, Topher.

39:20.084 --> 39:21.820
I know. I know. I know.

39:29.164 --> 39:30.481
I know.

39:30.505 --> 39:32.810
So how can I possibly make this right?

39:34.322 --> 39:36.569
How can I make this up to him?

39:36.593 --> 39:38.458
You're gonna figure out a way.

39:40.885 --> 39:42.169
I promise you.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.361
Right now, you need some rest.

39:44.385 --> 39:45.826
Let me drive you home.

39:45.850 --> 39:48.139
All right, brother.
