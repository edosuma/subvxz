00:30.339 --> 00:33.397
1991 DA NANG, VIETNAM

02:13.817 --> 02:15.809
<i>Hello, did you do all of this?</i>

02:33.400 --> 02:34.760
Beretta 93

02:35.320 --> 02:36.480
Usually dependable.

02:40.320 --> 02:41.560
We should be good to go now.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.240
<i>Come on.</i>

02:50.960 --> 02:51.560
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

03:30.006 --> 03:33.149
THIRTY YEARS LATER
BUCHAREST, ROMANIA

04:03.040 --> 04:05.560
<i>What the fuck? Are you having a party?</i>

04:07.600 --> 04:08.440
<i>Where is Anton?</i>

04:08.692 --> 04:10.141
<i>Why didn't he answer the phone?</i>

04:12.080 --> 04:12.840
<i>Vali!</i>

04:13.080 --> 04:14.585
<i>Your father is looking for you.</i>

04:14.960 --> 04:15.520
<i>Get up!</i>

04:16.680 --> 04:18.320
<i>Get up, Vali!</i>

04:19.240 --> 04:21.399
<i>Come on, girls, come on. Go home.</i>

04:23.240 --> 04:26.120
<i>Away, away!
Come on, get out of here.</i>

04:26.840 --> 04:27.920
<i>Come on Vali, let's go.</i>

04:29.440 --> 04:29.960
<i>Anton?</i>

04:30.920 --> 04:32.159
<i>Where the fuck is Vali?</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.200
<i>You had to look over him,
where the fuck is Vali?</i>

04:40.600 --> 04:41.560
<i>Yes?</i>

04:41.560 --> 04:42.440
<i>Who's talking?</i>

04:42.680 --> 04:43.520
<i>It's me, Vali.</i>

04:43.840 --> 04:45.159
<i>Vali?</i>

04:45.338 --> 04:47.472
<i>Explain to me where did you go?
Why don't you--</i>

04:47.523 --> 04:49.998
<i>Some assholes kidnapped me
outside the hotel.</i>

04:50.080 --> 04:51.339
<i>What? Who?</i>

04:51.960 --> 04:52.760
<i>Who kidnapped you?</i>

04:52.960 --> 04:55.040
<i>How they fuck would I know?</i>

04:55.240 --> 04:57.040
<i>They want three million euros now.</i>

04:57.400 --> 04:59.306
<i>Vali, tell them how I am.</i>

04:59.440 --> 05:02.200
<i>They don't fucking care
who you are, just pay!</i>

05:02.600 --> 05:04.629
<i>They want three million euros
in two hours.</i>

05:04.729 --> 05:06.244
<i>Or they'll cut my throat like a pig.</i>

07:06.160 --> 07:08.200
How dare you take my boy?

07:14.960 --> 07:17.120
There it is. You wanna count it?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.080
Do you know who I am?

07:22.920 --> 07:23.920
Don Preda.

07:25.302 --> 07:27.680
Butcher of Bucharest, Killer of Men.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.520
Tell your boss it's done.

07:35.159 --> 07:36.760
Exactly, who are you people?

07:38.080 --> 07:39.080
We're just--

07:39.840 --> 07:41.680
We just find people
who can't be found.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.159
The money.

07:46.044 --> 07:47.878
You gonna have it maybe for an hour.

07:47.960 --> 07:52.400
Then we come take it back, cut you both
into pieces and feed you to my pigs.

07:56.159 --> 07:57.480
That doesn't worry you?

07:59.640 --> 08:00.400
No.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.120
Why?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.000
I didn't come here for money.

08:05.040 --> 08:06.560
I came here for you.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.360
<i>Stop the girl. She killed
Don Preda. Kill her.</i>

09:03.040 --> 09:04.680
Why are you fighting so hard, huh?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.160
You're going home, motherfucker.
Fuck off!

09:23.280 --> 09:24.040
I'm good.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.760
<i>You fucking pieces of shit.
You can't leave me here!</i>

09:30.680 --> 09:32.400
<i>Fuck you, you bastards!</i>

09:45.311 --> 09:46.482
Did you take any, huh?

09:46.532 --> 09:47.757
Take what?

09:48.120 --> 09:49.000
Money.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.539
It was all there, right?

09:50.760 --> 09:53.120
We were paid to eliminate
the target. We did that.

09:53.177 --> 09:56.760
Yeah, you know, three mil…
dirty money… nobody's looking for…

09:56.760 --> 09:57.960
Just saying.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.280
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you're hurting.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.880
Please.

10:04.720 --> 10:08.120
This is R & D Plumbing.
Your leak has been fixed.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.600
Please remit the balance
of your payment for the withd--

10:17.125 --> 10:18.713
<i>€7,000,000. Transfer complete.</i>

10:18.840 --> 10:19.440
Done.

10:19.861 --> 10:21.960
You need to see a doctor about that cough.

10:22.360 --> 10:23.640
Traditional or a witch?

10:24.080 --> 10:25.840
You? Definitely a witch.

10:26.256 --> 10:28.200
Ah, I know just the voodoo queen to call.

10:36.518 --> 10:38.493
LONDON

12:19.480 --> 12:22.040
Chelmsford was a bloody war zone.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.258
Every train was 30 minutes late
and jam-packed as always.

12:25.582 --> 12:26.601
Welcome back.

12:26.654 --> 12:28.133
Thank you for taking care of her,

12:28.157 --> 12:30.439
you know you're the only one
she'll tolerate, right?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.397
She gets really mean when you're away.

12:32.497 --> 12:35.325
Spent most of the time
hanging out with Proust.

12:35.425 --> 12:36.198
Is that true?

12:36.223 --> 12:38.400
Three weeks, and this
is all you come back with?

12:38.473 --> 12:39.402
Ah, you know sellers,

12:39.502 --> 12:42.167
they know you've come all that way,
and they play hard to get.

12:42.198 --> 12:44.000
Didn't you wanna
just kill people like that?

12:50.710 --> 12:52.920
What do you think you're doing, huh?

13:29.440 --> 13:33.680
So, the other day, he says to me
"70 is the new 30."

13:35.780 --> 13:37.673
Well, that's just something old guys say.

13:40.180 --> 13:43.125
How is he doing with his protocol?
Is he following the doctor's orders?

13:43.150 --> 13:45.310
More like, following his own orders.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.600
Happy birth--

13:57.880 --> 14:00.280
No more fucking birthdays.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.000
Take birthdays and shove them up your ass.

14:07.040 --> 14:07.720
Bastard.

14:13.640 --> 14:16.120
What a wonderful toy!

14:22.360 --> 14:24.400
You skimped on the candles I see.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.880
Seventy would have been a fire hazard.

14:28.480 --> 14:29.980
Could you make us some tea please?

14:30.160 --> 14:31.080
Sure.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.489
All right, make your wish.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.440
Happy birthday.

14:43.153 --> 14:43.988
Yeah.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.200
To thank you.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.920
A 1958 Gibson Flying V.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.160
This was in production just two years.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.920
There is only 90 in the whole world.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.040
I know.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.160
That sound…

15:30.040 --> 15:30.960
It's the wood.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.480
African limba.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.960
Nothing else sounds like it.

15:37.840 --> 15:40.440
I was just about giving up hope
on finding one.

15:40.871 --> 15:43.551
How in the world did you…

15:43.600 --> 15:44.240
You.

15:44.912 --> 15:47.472
You taught me how to find things
that didn't wanna be found.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.520
Albert King played one.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.280
Albert King played that one.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.120
No!

15:56.200 --> 15:57.640
No!

16:00.288 --> 16:01.917
You're gonna cry now, aren't you?

16:01.960 --> 16:04.800
Only because I can't play it the way
it needs to be played.

16:08.120 --> 16:08.840
Thank you.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.683
One of the twins called me
last night, said she was pregnant.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.080
Daisy in Dover?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.720
No, Daisy in Manchester.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.360
Daisy in Dover is a dyke.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.811
It is a rare gift to have a friend
who trusts you enough

16:40.400 --> 16:42.640
not to try and help until you ask.

16:56.889 --> 16:58.939
If you fell in the pond
with those you'd drown.

16:59.039 --> 17:02.023
Well, if I fell in a pond without them
I would probably float away.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.880
-Hi, honey.
-Mind your fingers.

17:10.598 --> 17:11.760
That hefa bites.

17:12.280 --> 17:14.358
She's a baby and doesn't know any better.

17:18.960 --> 17:19.598
There.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.000
You have your own secret hideout.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.160
Why am I not surprised?

17:34.600 --> 17:35.640
I bought the building.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.120
-What?
-The bookstore.

17:39.520 --> 17:40.960
It's yours. Free and clear.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.920
You didn't have to do that.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.560
I know, but it's your passion.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.155
And, it makes me feel good to know

17:51.255 --> 17:53.807
you'll have something
to work on while I'm gone.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.280
What is that?

18:00.520 --> 18:04.560
Those are the souls
waiting for me on the other side.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.960
I'm sure they have a reception planned.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.360
Ah… sent away so many prematurely.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.960
Either by my hand or through you.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.038
We never sent anyone away
who didn't have it coming.

18:16.120 --> 18:16.920
Maybe.

18:17.952 --> 18:21.405
But… I'm sure there are
quite a few spirits up there

18:21.440 --> 18:23.400
waiting for me with a bone to pick.

18:25.951 --> 18:27.711
You really believe you're going up?

18:27.960 --> 18:28.600
Don't you?

18:39.760 --> 18:41.080
Lucas Hayes.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.840
I need our friend to find him for me.

18:45.000 --> 18:49.240
I have him up till 1998, Paris,
after that nothing.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.560
-Just find?
-Just find.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.960
Discreetly, and with the quickness.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.160
Okay.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.320
I may have to go back to Vietnam.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.403
It'd be nice if you went with me.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.546
I'm never going back there.

19:08.320 --> 19:13.115
Our past is never
where we left it, little chameleon.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.920
We all have scars.

19:16.360 --> 19:19.200
You stare at them long enough
you remember how you got them.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.760
-Hi.
-Morning.

19:56.640 --> 20:00.124
The blue dress has a small tear in it,
I was hoping to talk to Benny about it.

20:19.042 --> 20:20.066
What do you think?

20:20.760 --> 20:21.400
Of what?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.440
My, mustache.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.760
Oh, you know, I don't have
my contacts in, sorry.

20:31.960 --> 20:32.640
Funny.

20:33.072 --> 20:36.872
You wait till this grows in
women like you are gonna be so…

20:38.080 --> 20:39.920
No, it's okay. I'll help you out.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.400
I need you to find this guy.

20:42.000 --> 20:45.360
What? No satellite shots of a
mafia compound outside Bucharest?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.400
No, but that was
some of your better work.

20:47.640 --> 20:51.640
Moody wants this guy, Lucas Hayes,
last seen in Paris in '98 and then nothing.

20:52.320 --> 20:52.960
Yeah.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.022
I'll be with you in a second.

21:01.120 --> 21:01.960
Can I help you?

21:02.400 --> 21:07.850
Yeah, I'm looking for a book,
an old book. Like, rare.

21:08.320 --> 21:09.560
-"Like rare"?
-Yeah.

21:09.615 --> 21:11.099
Either they are or they aren't.

21:11.123 --> 21:14.055
Books aren't like stake,
you can't get them like medium rare.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.600
-It's funny.
-Sarcastic.

21:15.640 --> 21:16.840
Yes, but funny.

21:17.320 --> 21:22.320
Listen, my boss' wife is having a party
and she collects books, first editions.

21:22.399 --> 21:23.400
Any particular subject?

21:23.425 --> 21:25.625
Birds. It's Audobon's…

21:25.760 --> 21:26.600
"Birds of America"?

21:26.640 --> 21:29.080
Yeah, that's it.
He said she's looking for a copy.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.480
-A first edition?
-Yeah.

21:30.860 --> 21:32.320
-Sorry.
-You don't have it?

21:32.423 --> 21:34.210
No one does,
only one first editions exists,

21:34.235 --> 21:37.760
it was sold to a private buyer
in 1991 for a 9.6 million dollars.

21:38.480 --> 21:39.640
Wow, okay.

21:39.920 --> 21:41.480
Well, looks like I'm out of luck.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.960
All right. What do you think?
Maybe poetry?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.647
Hang on…

21:54.520 --> 21:55.920
It'll be the hit of the party.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.001
TAMERLANE AND OTHER POEMS

21:58.800 --> 22:00.960
I don't-- I don't know this one.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.600
It's Edgar Allan Poe actually.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.440
His first collection of poems
published anonymously.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.627
You think she might have it?

22:06.658 --> 22:10.080
Doubtful. Only 50 copies were printed.
Only 12 are known to exist.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.200
How much?

22:12.360 --> 22:14.680
I can give it to you for $265,000.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.880
Perhaps a bracelet instead?

22:18.920 --> 22:21.440
She does have exquisite wrists, good idea.

22:30.769 --> 22:31.971
Is there something else?

22:32.040 --> 22:33.360
I find you interesting.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.360
-You mean--
-You're interesting.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.620
Beautiful, sure, not in that
ornamental kind of way.

22:38.722 --> 22:40.920
It's the interesting part
that got me wondering,

22:41.200 --> 22:42.200
Wondering what?

22:42.200 --> 22:45.080
How long after I give you
my number will it take you

22:45.120 --> 22:47.680
to decide that I'm just
as interesting and give me a call?

22:48.280 --> 22:49.240
Twenty seven minutes.

22:49.840 --> 22:50.360
That long?

22:50.440 --> 22:54.320
First I have to pretend to cancel my date
and then I have to feed my cat.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.440
That's six.

22:55.880 --> 22:57.714
The rest is me playing hard to get.

23:06.567 --> 23:07.535
Cute.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.120
How many of these are you
carrying around, Mr…

23:10.160 --> 23:12.240
Rembrandt. Michael Rembrandt.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.360
Actually, I haven't had an occasion
to use one until just now.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.480
So…

23:20.360 --> 23:21.120
Interesting.

23:27.960 --> 23:34.011
"There rose a fountain once, and there
full many a fair flower raised its head."

23:41.240 --> 23:42.880
That was from the book, wasn't it.

23:43.760 --> 23:48.041
"But she who rear'd them was long dead,
And in such follies had no part."

24:01.960 --> 24:03.520
You almost got me on this one.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.240
You didn't say I'd be tracking
an eight year old.

24:06.640 --> 24:11.498
Lucas Hayes did arrive in Paris in '98,
but returned to Da Nang, March '99.

24:13.020 --> 24:14.600
Everything else I have is on there.

24:45.526 --> 24:47.958
B. B. KING
LIVE AT THE VILLAGE GATE

27:06.536 --> 27:08.566
READY TO GO

27:31.160 --> 27:31.960
Benny?

27:32.160 --> 27:34.240
You'll stay up
until I get there, 45 minutes.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.200
Lucas Hayes, born April 5, 1990.

30:23.453 --> 30:25.554
Father: Edward Hayes.
Mother: Mary Christian.

30:33.382 --> 30:34.716
St. Quiteria Hospital

30:34.869 --> 30:37.376
Lucas Hayes, admitted
to St Quiteria Hospital on June 2nd, 1999.

30:40.103 --> 30:43.453
Father: Edward Hayes, assassinated
at Christmas Day, 1991. No other records.

31:09.283 --> 31:11.879
Edward Arthur Hayes

31:14.123 --> 31:17.245
Businessman indicted for war crimes
dies in car bomb attack.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.330
Edward Hayes… was killed
in a car explosion in Da Nang yesterday.

31:27.769 --> 31:28.680
Moody.

31:32.615 --> 31:34.258
"Company will continue," vows CEO

31:34.315 --> 31:36.015
"Edward Hayes
was my partner for 25 years.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.561
I will continue to steer our company
as he would have wanted me to."

31:42.113 --> 31:45.020
Jossino Vohl

32:04.426 --> 32:06.529
DA NANG, VIETNAM

34:07.043 --> 34:08.668
Shit! What the fuck is that?

34:17.040 --> 34:17.960
Fuck.

34:47.120 --> 34:49.360
<i>Honey! Come on.</i>

34:55.679 --> 34:57.440
Never thought I'd see you here again.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.807
Well, maybe you're not seeing me now.

34:59.840 --> 35:00.880
Who's the bitch?

35:00.920 --> 35:01.840
Billy Boy…

35:02.003 --> 35:04.800
I know you run with all kinds
but now you're running with stupid?

35:04.880 --> 35:05.541
Fuck you!

35:05.576 --> 35:09.246
Hey! Go get a drink, sugar,
and give the adults some privacy, huh?

35:11.680 --> 35:12.440
Beers!

35:17.640 --> 35:18.960
Is that your ride outside?

35:20.440 --> 35:22.000
Yours now.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.640
It ain't my birthday.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.600
Jossino Vohl.

35:28.600 --> 35:29.640
How's Moody?

35:31.680 --> 35:32.280
He's dead.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.040
For Moody.

35:44.280 --> 35:45.320
Vohl involved?

35:46.680 --> 35:49.160
I don't know. But he knows who is.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.800
-He's gonna be hard to kill.
-I just wanna talk to him.

35:54.480 --> 35:55.320
Steverino!

35:55.680 --> 35:56.320
Yeah, Boss?

35:57.440 --> 35:59.320
You work security at the State Tower.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.040
My friend there needs
a few minutes with Vohl.

36:02.040 --> 36:02.920
Alone.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.850
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

36:07.234 --> 36:09.458
He goes nowhere without private security.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.960
The guy's never alone.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.240
<i>What is happening?</i>

37:38.200 --> 37:40.960
This is how easy it is
for me to get to you, Mr. Vohl.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.600
Do you understand?

37:43.840 --> 37:46.560
You were friends and business
partners with Edward Hayes,

37:46.760 --> 37:49.960
so you would know most
about his short but interesting life.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.320
Good, cause I have questions.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.173
You give me answers:
if I'm satisfied you'll never see me again,

37:55.273 --> 37:58.291
if I'm not, I'll be
the last thing you'll ever see.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.160
I look forward to hearing from you.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.960
<i>Good evening, Miss.</i>

38:27.240 --> 38:31.040
<i>It's been a long time since such
a beautiful young woman gave me her number.</i>

38:31.360 --> 38:32.840
You know who I am.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.960
Jossino Vohl, born in April, 1945.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.120
French national,
residing full time in Vietnam.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.720
Was in business with Edward Hayes
until his untimely death.

38:42.960 --> 38:47.440
Now you're a top political power broker
with some interesting side hobbies.

38:48.120 --> 38:50.480
I see you're familiar with my resume.

38:50.680 --> 38:53.275
I am not interested
in your business activities, Mr. Vohl.

38:53.393 --> 38:55.480
I want to talk
about your friend's son, Lucas.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.640
My office, one hour.

38:58.960 --> 38:59.720
We'll be alone?

39:00.640 --> 39:01.960
<i>My lawyer will be present.</i>

39:02.960 --> 39:05.680
That would be the man
standing behind you pouring a scotch?

39:46.720 --> 39:48.200
<i>Delighted, Miss.</i>

39:48.800 --> 39:50.240
Exactly on time.

40:00.880 --> 40:01.760
Please.

40:03.680 --> 40:05.640
Monsieur Duquet,
my personal attorney.

40:07.137 --> 40:09.706
-Would you like some champagne?
-Edward Arthur Hayes.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.480
Eddie and I were involved
in a bauxite mining project together

40:19.680 --> 40:20.560
until his accident.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.360
It wasn't an accident,
it was an assassination.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.720
We were useful.

40:28.160 --> 40:32.320
The country was malleable,
ripe for certain business practices.

40:32.600 --> 40:35.240
Eddie was juggling
a lot of delicate plates.

40:36.000 --> 40:39.840
What's your interest in a man
who's been dead almost thirty years?

40:40.640 --> 40:42.080
I'm interested in his son.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.080
Lucas Hayes.

40:44.240 --> 40:45.200
I'm sorry?

40:45.360 --> 40:47.669
Three people are dead
because they inquired about him.

40:47.840 --> 40:50.200
He had them killed
and I'm going to find him.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.802
Should I be talking to him?

40:55.480 --> 40:58.360
I have no connection with Lucas Hayes.

40:59.080 --> 41:01.320
And what does any of this
got to do with me?

41:01.440 --> 41:02.920
I was wondering the same thing.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.920
Mr. Vohl's past relationships
are no one's concern.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.000
And certainly none of yours.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.377
Oh, I've made them my concern.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.040
Too bad.

41:36.440 --> 41:38.960
I need to know everything.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.080
Who are you?

41:43.480 --> 41:44.600
Who hired you?

41:46.880 --> 41:48.600
Why the interest in Lucas Hayes?

41:56.082 --> 41:57.884
We can do this another way if you'd like.

42:11.160 --> 42:12.400
Fucking let me go!

42:16.560 --> 42:17.480
Get up there.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.200
Hand me a gun.

42:31.657 --> 42:32.782
SPRINKLER VALVE

42:49.960 --> 42:51.922
Where the fuck do you think you're going?

43:17.400 --> 43:18.040
Say it.

43:18.960 --> 43:19.480
Fuck you!

43:19.520 --> 43:20.200
Say it!

43:53.295 --> 43:54.644
<i>She's down there!</i>

45:05.880 --> 45:07.659
Let's start with your name.

45:12.040 --> 45:14.240
Why was Moody looking
for Edward Hayes' son?

45:17.360 --> 45:19.280
Who else out there
should we know about?

46:15.320 --> 46:16.040
Fuck!

46:16.520 --> 46:18.400
Anyone ever last this long.

46:19.320 --> 46:20.960
It's out of our hands now, anyway.

46:23.000 --> 46:23.520
Him?

46:35.720 --> 46:37.520
That was a long 27 minutes.

46:38.720 --> 46:40.466
I'm still waiting for your call.

46:41.320 --> 46:42.330
It's all right.

46:42.520 --> 46:44.398
I don't take these things personally.

46:45.960 --> 46:46.840
Bone broth.

46:48.280 --> 46:50.720
Helps with inflammation and bruising.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.400
Here.

46:54.040 --> 46:55.994
Careful. It's hot. Watch it.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.040
There you go.

46:59.817 --> 47:00.720
I like this myself.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.960
Here you go, small sips.

47:08.120 --> 47:08.800
Good?

47:12.040 --> 47:13.354
Not gonna lie to you,

47:14.760 --> 47:17.120
there's not much of a chance
this ends well for you.

47:19.440 --> 47:20.480
That guy out there.

47:20.840 --> 47:22.440
We work for the same individual.

47:22.760 --> 47:25.440
Boss has a problem.
He calls him, he takes care of it.

47:27.195 --> 47:30.280
Little heavy handed for my taste
but that's not my call.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.200
I'm sorry about your friend, Moody.

47:37.280 --> 47:38.280
I had no part in that.

47:39.440 --> 47:41.280
Or the fire fight at the bookstore.

47:41.720 --> 47:43.040
I'm an after-the-facts guy.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.720
I come in to make sure
there's no loose ends.

47:46.040 --> 47:48.720
I look for things that might
seem benign, but aren't.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.920
Like a bookstore run by an assassin,
boy, I never saw that one coming.

47:53.880 --> 47:55.480
I misread you completely.

48:00.760 --> 48:02.418
I can help you out of here.

48:02.680 --> 48:03.514
Okay?

48:04.200 --> 48:05.588
But you have to help me.

48:07.360 --> 48:09.160
I'm your last line of defense.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.080
End of the road, no more lifelines.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.240
You understand?

48:19.920 --> 48:20.520
All right.

48:23.560 --> 48:25.360
You forgot to blanch the bones.

48:28.000 --> 48:28.840
Your soup.

48:31.280 --> 48:33.840
You have to blanch the bones
before you roast them.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.400
Locks the minerals in,
it's better for healing.

48:53.000 --> 48:54.387
You got anything out of her?

48:54.520 --> 48:55.600
Yes and no.

48:56.060 --> 48:58.046
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

48:58.109 --> 49:00.398
Means I'll be back in the morning
to follow up with her.

49:00.427 --> 49:02.486
-I don't need you here, Rembrandt.
-Well…

49:02.600 --> 49:04.640
the man who signs the checks
thought differently.

49:04.680 --> 49:05.672
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

49:06.080 --> 49:06.880
And why is that?

49:07.160 --> 49:08.560
Oh, I don't know.

49:08.774 --> 49:11.480
Maybe it's because you killed Vohl
without asking his permission.

49:11.480 --> 49:13.760
Vohl knew everything,
he was a direct connection.

49:13.920 --> 49:15.440
Would've folded like a tent.

49:15.480 --> 49:20.000
You… yes, kill me, you're all the same:
shoot first and ask questions later.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.287
And hold off on those
enhanced interrogation techniques.

49:23.545 --> 49:25.433
I want her clear-headed in the morning.

49:30.160 --> 49:31.680
He'll break her tomorrow.

49:32.280 --> 49:33.600
Maybe he broke her already.

49:35.660 --> 49:38.229
The old man is desperate
to know what she knows.

49:40.875 --> 49:44.804
I wonder how it'd feel if his boy wonder
ends up killing her before he finds out.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.040
I'm guessing he'll look
for a new boy wonder.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.913
Just when we were getting
to know each other.

51:47.760 --> 51:50.360
I've got teams at the airport,
shipyard and train station.

51:50.400 --> 51:54.360
She's not gonna run, she's gonna lick
her wounds. Then she's coming after you.

51:54.960 --> 51:55.760
Good.

51:56.840 --> 51:57.280
Really?

51:58.480 --> 52:02.440
Cause right now it's 4:0. She's wining.

52:10.720 --> 52:12.000
Where do you buy your suits?

52:12.320 --> 52:14.280
Cause I've got a cousin as big and tall

52:14.600 --> 52:15.760
and he's a hard time.

52:18.880 --> 52:19.840
Nobody's home.

52:23.160 --> 52:25.280
Well, I can get you to the border.

52:25.960 --> 52:28.200
London may not be safe
for you right now.

52:33.680 --> 52:35.320
This is Vietnam, Anna,

52:35.320 --> 52:36.720
you know what's it like here.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.120
You owe it to Moody to stay alive.

52:41.520 --> 52:42.840
I know what I owe him.

52:55.019 --> 52:56.141
<i>Go.</i>

52:58.560 --> 53:00.444
The fuck you think
I gave you the money fo--

53:12.320 --> 53:13.480
End of the line, kid.

53:28.400 --> 53:29.080
Get in!

53:29.880 --> 53:31.280
Watch out!

53:32.560 --> 53:35.000
Moody was beautiful,

53:36.680 --> 53:37.760
in his way.

53:39.040 --> 53:40.250
He was kind.

53:41.160 --> 53:44.320
And not through effort,
it was just a part of who he was.

53:46.400 --> 53:48.880
He didn't save my life,
he gave me a life.

53:51.480 --> 53:55.186
He knew who I was, what I've become.

53:55.494 --> 53:57.720
And he protected me.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.280
Hayes has been dead for thirty years,

54:07.480 --> 54:08.680
Vohl was gone longer.

54:09.720 --> 54:12.040
You've got some very bad people
looking for you.

54:12.480 --> 54:15.400
Lucas Hayes killed Moody,
he knows I'm looking for him.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.400
His last known location
is St. Quiteria Hospital.

54:20.440 --> 54:23.640
Nobody is as deaf as those
who don't wanna listen.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.520
<i>Hello, Ms. Nguyen.</i>

55:35.960 --> 55:39.229
It's been some time since we've had
a visit from the Ministry of Health.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.200
And to request records
from that far back…

55:41.240 --> 55:42.289
Yes, I know.

55:42.375 --> 55:44.799
We're hoping to find something
in there that will help us

55:44.867 --> 55:48.091
rule out environmental factors,
cause we are in the midst of a study.

55:48.137 --> 55:48.746
Thank you.

55:49.040 --> 55:51.840
Lucas Hayes, well before my time here.

55:57.000 --> 55:59.399
2 5 8 5 0 2 4 5 8 6.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.600
<i>Copy, I'll get Doc on it.</i>

56:01.800 --> 56:02.400
Okay.

56:19.960 --> 56:22.600
<i>Doc came through, pulled his records.</i>

56:22.880 --> 56:23.560
And?

56:23.840 --> 56:29.360
<i>Sit down: Lucas Hayes was admitted
to St. Quiteria on 2nd June, 1999,</i>

56:29.760 --> 56:32.479
<i>and according to his records never left.</i>

56:33.880 --> 56:37.400
I apologize, seems the boy was
re-admitted under the name Christian.

56:37.720 --> 56:39.720
Christian, right,
his mother's maiden name.

56:39.760 --> 56:41.440
He was already here when I arrived,

56:41.480 --> 56:43.426
been a patient
for more than twenty years.

56:48.480 --> 56:49.960
He doesn't like to be touched.

56:50.320 --> 56:52.480
He can't speak. Also deaf and blind.

56:54.720 --> 56:56.280
And how long has he been like this?

56:56.760 --> 57:00.200
He was diagnosed when he was six,
I believe, it regressed rapidly.

57:00.880 --> 57:02.720
It's a miracle he's lived as long.

57:03.480 --> 57:04.960
And who pays for his care?

57:05.880 --> 57:07.882
We have a generous endowment.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.280
Everyone here is treated for free.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.720
<i>Wow! Four men dead, nothing on camera.</i>

57:18.760 --> 57:20.280
<i>Place looks like an abattoir.</i>

57:20.480 --> 57:21.360
<i>Was it the food?</i>

57:21.480 --> 57:23.280
You know, it was bad manners.

57:23.320 --> 57:25.129
Yeah, well, that's no way to treat a lady.

57:25.237 --> 57:26.520
I'm no lady.

57:26.560 --> 57:28.138
Not that I was a gentleman myself.

57:28.280 --> 57:29.800
I wouldn't sell yourself short.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.360
<i>Coming from you, that's a compliment.</i>

57:32.860 --> 57:34.320
I'm in the middle of something--

57:34.360 --> 57:36.800
Hey, how were good sisters
of the St. Quiteria?

57:41.000 --> 57:43.997
Good enough to let me know
I've been looking for the wrong person.

57:44.040 --> 57:44.960
<i>Good gals out there.</i>

57:45.480 --> 57:47.252
St. Quiteria, do you know who she was?

57:47.880 --> 57:50.960
Fifteen years old, she led a guerrilla war
against the Roman legions.

57:51.633 --> 57:52.218
Bad ass.

57:52.318 --> 57:54.400
They chopped off her head
and fed the rest to the dogs.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.040
Again, bad manners.

57:56.080 --> 57:59.880
Hey, you up for a dinner? I could answer
some questions and save you some time.

57:59.920 --> 58:02.680
<i>What do say if we say La Cinq?
Tomorrow night, eight o'clock.</i>

58:02.880 --> 58:04.986
I mean you can say it.
But I won't be there.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.520
I'll give you the time and place.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.240
You're intrigued by her.

58:14.080 --> 58:14.720
Curious.

58:15.480 --> 58:16.360
Need I worry?

58:24.440 --> 58:27.560
The gala list, sir,
200 guests, all vetted.

58:28.400 --> 58:31.080
The joys of a room full of
the wealthy and the privileged

58:31.120 --> 58:33.440
donating large sums for a noble cause.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.760
Never gets old.

58:37.280 --> 58:37.760
Good.

58:43.680 --> 58:44.560
Why did you do this?

58:45.440 --> 58:47.919
It's what people in my position
are supposed to do, Michael.

58:48.840 --> 58:50.240
Give to the less fortunate.

58:51.000 --> 58:52.520
I asked if I should be worried.

58:53.800 --> 58:54.680
About the woman.

58:54.937 --> 58:57.857
Nope. Not yet.

58:58.120 --> 59:01.440
Please wrap up
this unpleasantness by Sunday.

59:02.400 --> 59:04.800
I don't wanna be embarrassed
before the celebration.

59:24.280 --> 59:24.960
Wow.

59:28.520 --> 59:29.259
Thank you, Ben.

59:33.480 --> 59:34.520
They know me here.

59:35.280 --> 59:35.880
Cheers.

59:38.060 --> 59:39.471
Someone killed a friend of mine

59:39.571 --> 59:41.988
because of a contract
he completed years ago.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.520
And anyone I ask about it ends up dead.

59:44.520 --> 59:45.560
Why is that?

59:45.560 --> 59:48.360
I don't know, but some people
might take it as a sign.

59:48.640 --> 59:51.612
Why don't you just consider it
a mystery best left unsolved?

59:51.737 --> 59:53.266
But I like mysteries.

59:53.600 --> 59:57.800
When I started this I was curios.
And then I went from curious to concerned.

59:58.000 --> 59:58.680
And now?

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.040
I'm testy.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:03.040
An trust me, you don't wanna
know me when I'm testy.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.200
HK 9mm.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:10.600
Very good.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.195
Not from where I'm sitting.

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:16.409
Who's paying for the orphan kid?
I'd like to talk to whoever that is.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:17.320
That'd be unwise.

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:20.560
<i>Unwise</i> is killing a man
who was a second father to me.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.360
We are way past unwise.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.320
This is a really bad place for a hit.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:28.680
High-end restaurant, the security
at every exit, not to mention the cameras.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:31.040
You know what, you already knew that.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.520
Oh, I'm not here to kill you…

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.240
Yet. Just to get answers.

01:00:36.661 --> 01:00:37.840
You always ask like this?

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:40.480
Yeah, I like to have peoples' attention
when I talk, you know?

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:40.960
Well…

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.480
you certainly have the attention
of the boys down there.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.280
Look, you're gonna have to put
at least three in me to be sure.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.120
Four.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.788
Fine. That leaves you with five.
In case there's trouble

01:00:52.888 --> 01:00:54.837
You think that's enough
to get you out of here?

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.160
Four quick shots and then the slow walk
to the exit amongst the chaos. Yeah.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:02.880
Something unexpected could happen.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.360
You know, it usually does.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:10.280
SIG 226, it's got that great kick.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:11.520
Yeah.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:19.840
How about that.
Our first awkward silence.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.960
You know what, I didn't get your name.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:24.800
Anna.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.360
Pleasure.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.280
We'll see.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.160
What do you say we forget these tricks.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.520
Let's just go for a nice hotel.

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.360
You point a gun at my pussy
and then you ask me to bed?

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:39.640
I like your style.

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.400
Said the woman with hollow-points
pointed at my balls.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.855
Well, let's hope this doesn't get messy,
These are my favorite shoes.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.240
Manolo's, classic four inch pumps.

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.960
A man who knows Poe and footwear.

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.400
Let me put this to you delicately,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.360
you keep this up, you're gonna die.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.120
Vietnam has always been a place of death.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:06.320
Only lucky ones make it out alive.
I was lucky once.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.760
You don't get lucky twice.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:10.960
I'm going to find out
who killed my friend.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.200
And when you do?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.320
I'm going to end their life,
and anyone standing in my way.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.600
Thank you for a lovely evening.

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.200
Hey, I know it sounds crazy,

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:27.880
but I'd really like to see you again

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:31.600
under, you know, different circumstances.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.400
This was personal time.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:37.280
So these are the best circumstances
you'll ever see me in.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:20.160
Speak.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.320
Call me when it's done.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.542
I thought you're off
chasing corrupt accountants.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:38.080
I found a hotel room with all
of her shit, including her passport.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.120
Name's Nadia Zhukova.

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:42.320
An Asian Russian.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:43.560
Boy.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.834
You don't really see that ever.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.376
Good work, you must be exhausted, huh?

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:08.480
Looks like I'm a day late.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.400
<i>And a dollar short.
Didn't take much I'm afraid.</i>

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:12.800
He sang like a bird, didn't he?

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.800
<i>All of the things I know now.</i>

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:18.120
<i>I know who your boss is,
the man who sanctioned Moody's killing.</i>

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.160
He's a big fish.

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.040
<i>More fun when you hook him.</i>

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:25.640
Well, then I guess…

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.080
I guess we'll be seeing
each other real soon then.

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.960
<i>Sooner than you think.</i>

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.560
<i>Hey, what happened to your hand?</i>

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:31.880
Make up your mind:

01:09:32.639 --> 01:09:35.233
kill me or fuck me?

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.712
It's so weird that we're
in this guy's bed while he's…

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:51.880
up there.

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.200
You know, hanging.

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:57.920
No.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:09:59.920
Would be a waste of a nice bed.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.800
Okay.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.784
How long have you been doing this?

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.280
Not, you know, this, but…

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.760
Long enough not to miss.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.000
You got lucky.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.440
Nah.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:18.520
You don't want me dead.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.320
Yet.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.160
Why haven't you killed me?

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:24.960
Could you?

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:31.415
I could put two in the back of your head
and go make a sandwich.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:34.840
Well.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:39.600
You always said
this wasn't gonna work out.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:41.040
No.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.639
It's been my experience, it never does.
At least not for the other guy.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:47.960
Have a way around that?

01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:49.840
You are holding all the cards.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.719
I'm watching a woman
who walk over a shark tank

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.120
on a tight rope in high winds.

01:10:59.559 --> 01:11:01.378
You're not gonna make it, Anna.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:03.800
He's a bad man.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.040
Who's done very bad things.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.960
So, you just gonna lay there?

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.080
Good to see you, kid.

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.639
Get in. Get out.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.719
You know you only get lucky once.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:15.120
Yeah. Someone else just told me that.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:15.880
Okay.

01:12:18.243 --> 01:12:19.340
God!

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:22.199
-Just a little glue. Just a little glue.
-What's wrong with you!

01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:23.960
It's okay, grit your teeth.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.040
Oh, God.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.760
You know, I still feel
really bad about Claudia.

01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.800
She couldn't cook worth a shit,
but she didn't deserve to die like that.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.280
Here we go.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:36.840
Okay.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.120
Okay, okay. We're done here.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.000
Did you really think
they can kill me that easily?

01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:57.320
Before I blew the rest of it off he didn't
have much of a face to begin with.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:05.920
And I left just enough of me
for the authorities to think it was me.

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:09.160
I'm sorry you had
to be the one who found him.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.600
You could always think
on your feet anyway.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.559
Not so much tonight.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.480
That's what friends are for, right?

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.120
Oh, good. We're friends again.

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.520
You got laid, didn't you?

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.719
Depending more and more on this shit

01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:47.040
to take the edge off.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.920
So, what's the plan?

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.605
Four hundred acres, to get there

01:14:00.705 --> 01:14:03.437
you'd have to hike through 12 miles
of rat-infested jungle.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.480
That leaves the river,
cameras, sonar, patrol boats.

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:09.680
Still a pessimistic little shit,
aren't you?

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.160
And you're still a cockroach
you can't kill.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:13.920
I mean it in a good way.

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:18.120
They know you're coming.

01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.760
What is this?

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:23.840
It's a panic room,
in this case it's a panic bunker.

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:27.160
If he gets in there, you're done.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.800
All the guests arrive by boat,

01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:32.080
they'll be screened
a moment they disembark.

01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.040
Perimeter locked down and site secured.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.880
And I've added an additional team
of 16 out of Israel just for the night.

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.639
Seems like you got everything covered.

01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:41.639
Michael.

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:44.080
Thoughts?

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:47.440
Venice.

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.639
It's really nice this time of year.

01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:53.240
You should go. Now.

01:14:56.160 --> 01:14:58.400
These guys have no idea
who they're dealing with.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.480
<i>Copy that.</i>

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.880
You look a little tense.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.680
I've protected everyone
from crowned princes to cartel kingpins.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.632
Nothing's gonna happen tonight
especially when we know what she looks like.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.320
Boy…

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:11.840
I really hope you got paid upfront.

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:18.360
Sir.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.400
Anything?

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.487
Nothing so far. Sectors one,
two and three are clear.

01:17:46.587 --> 01:17:48.675
I'm waiting on the reports
from sector four.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.120
Thank you.

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:38.120
It is with great pleasure that I welcome
you all here on this very expensive evening.

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:42.639
It warms my crusty heart to look across
the room and see so many familiar faces,

01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.600
dear friends, and close
business associates.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.639
As well as quite a few unfamiliar faces
that with luck will not remain so for long.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:54.453
Perhaps I may even have spotted
a few former foes of mine.

01:18:55.523 --> 01:18:57.532
I want especially to thank you for coming,

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.719
and for seeing the error of your ways.

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:04.639
Over these considerable years
I've learnt to my great satisfaction

01:19:04.680 --> 01:19:08.280
there is no better way to cleanse the soul

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.639
than to do good,
to perform selfless deeds.

01:19:10.639 --> 01:19:14.360
and acts of kindness,
to sacrifice for others,

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.719
and most importantly to give generously.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:20.639
It is due to your generous spirit

01:19:20.639 --> 01:19:22.920
that we've been able to enrich and enhance

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.067
the lives of so many infants,
children, young men and women

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:27.719
in desperate need of care

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.080
to a degree that would have been impossible
to achieve without every one of you.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:36.920
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
the privilege of being your host tonight.

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:41.480
And for allowing me to slide my hands
into your pockets and purses,

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.662
but for a worthy a cause.

01:19:44.866 --> 01:19:48.680
The sisters of St. Quiteria
do outstanding work… So…

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:51.320
…Give with your heart.

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:14.320
You look really good for a man
who's been dead thirty years, Mr. Hayes.

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.719
How'd you get in here?

01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.320
Technology.
It just gonna fuck us all one day.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.719
Who are you?

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.191
I'm the big bad wolf that comes to get you

01:23:30.291 --> 01:23:33.542
when someone on this Earth
decides your time is up.

01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.800
Moody.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:44.559
Resurrection is a bitch, ain't it?

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:47.280
You've come to finish the job,
haven't you?

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:51.680
Well, you did hire me
all those years ago to kill you, right?

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:03.719
Who was really in that car?

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.280
Does it matter? Disposable asset.
No one of any consequence.

01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.960
You see, that's the kind of shit
I expect someone like you to say.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:17.559
"No one of any consequence."

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.080
"Someone like me"?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.680
Man, I can't be all morally right.

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:26.280
I kill people for a living,
bad people, mind you, but still.

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.800
I never pretend to be anything else.

01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:33.960
You, you're front and center
of a dozen high-profile charitable causes.

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.830
The world sees you as clean
as first fucking snow.

01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.920
But your hands are covered in shit.

01:24:42.520 --> 01:24:46.719
Blood, everything from from sarin gas
to human trafficking.

01:24:48.559 --> 01:24:51.840
So you know why
I had to arrange my demise.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:25:00.120
I had a son,

01:25:00.559 --> 01:25:02.360
unexpected in many ways.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:05.760
But what I couldn't fathom
was the depths of love

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.371
I had for this child,

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.840
this imperfect, wonderful, vulnerable boy.

01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:16.880
If I were dead, Lucas would be free
from any threats or harm.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.080
Bullshit.

01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:21.559
You may love your son, Mr. Hayes,

01:25:22.456 --> 01:25:26.026
but that was your chance to disappear.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:31.200
You're very astute.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.680
No one looks for a dead man.

01:25:34.719 --> 01:25:38.680
I was able to continue behind the shroud
of respectability that allowed me to--

01:25:38.719 --> 01:25:40.559
To become a bigger monster.

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.559
The irony of all of this, Mr. Hayes,

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.760
is that I was just trying
to make amends to your son

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:48.600
for taking his father away from him.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:52.639
You brought all of this on yourself.

01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:12.840
Anna.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:24.320
You don't look so good.

01:26:24.639 --> 01:26:25.600
I don't know.

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:30.193
Nothing an Apple Martini
and a liter of AB positive won't fix, huh?

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:35.320
Hey, what do you think
the chances are of me getting either?

01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.480
Faint.

01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:43.920
Something funny?

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.840
I find it amusing you think
you're better than me.

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:49.680
Not better.

01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.480
Different.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.520
You see, most people are good, Mr. Hayes.

01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:04.840
Then occasionally they do something
they know is bad.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.760
Some people are bad, and they struggle
every day to keep it under control.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:14.960
Others… corrupt to the core and just
don't give a damn, that would be me.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:17.120
But evil…

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.600
Evil is a completely different
creature, Mr. Hayes.

01:27:25.559 --> 01:27:31.480
Evil believes bad is okay,
its actions are justified.

01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:33.840
Violence divorced from conscience,

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:37.880
no matter what toll it takes
or who it takes it upon.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.040
And there, my friend,
is where we part ways.

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.680
I'm just a bad man
who's looking to pay for his sins.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:51.760
I see.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.160
So you are here to clear
your conscience first then?

01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.840
You'll never get out of here alive.

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:14.440
I never intended to.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.840
One more thing.

01:28:21.639 --> 01:28:23.240
You could have killed the old man.

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.440
Why didn't you?

01:28:26.559 --> 01:28:28.080
That wasn't the plan.

01:29:15.656 --> 01:29:18.059
ANNA: IT'S BEEN A BLAST.
LOCATION

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:52.880
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.880
<i>No! No!</i>

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.960
<i>No! Mom!</i>

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:20.400
<i>Mom!</i>

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.280
What took you?

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:31.960
Just out for a bite.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:41.760
You just gonna stand there?

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.520
For now.

01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:50.320
It doesn't have to be this way, Anna.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:52.320
Not anymore.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.240
We all have to pay
for our sins eventually.

01:34:57.800 --> 01:34:59.040
Doesn't have to be today.

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:01.240
I'm tired.

01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.680
I want peace.

01:35:04.639 --> 01:35:06.719
And I can't have it
while you're out there.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.760
What if I told you you could?

01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:13.520
Yeah?

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.920
Two in the back of the head,
and then go have a sandwich.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:23.160
You can't buy back your past, Anna,
can't change where you came from,

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.392
but you can change where you're going.

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.600
Where would that be?

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:14.180
