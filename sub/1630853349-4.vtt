WEBVTT

00:29.920 --> 00:33.280
-Ken, where are you? Ken? Ken?

00:34.480 --> 00:38.520
Okay. 30,000 emails
just magically disappear.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.360
I mean, how do you explain that?

00:41.440 --> 00:45.160
Hey, Anthony, do you ever think
your obsession with conspiracies

00:45.240 --> 00:47.520
is a substitute for real human connection?

00:52.520 --> 00:53.720
-No, not really.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.840
Okay.

00:56.520 --> 00:58.680
What about the deep state?
Is all of that lies?

00:59.680 --> 01:00.680
Yes.

01:01.240 --> 01:02.080
Oh.

01:02.160 --> 01:05.800
Huh? What? So the government
doesn't do anything bad?

01:05.880 --> 01:08.760
No, they do dumb shit all the time.
Like evil shit.

01:08.840 --> 01:10.320
You mean like Pizzagate?

01:10.400 --> 01:13.360
No, I mean
like the Tuskegee syphilis experiment,

01:13.440 --> 01:17.480
where they deliberately gave
600 infected Black men placebos

01:17.560 --> 01:20.600
so they could study the effects
of the untreated disease,

01:20.680 --> 01:21.840
kind of evil shit.

01:22.840 --> 01:23.680
I agree.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.520
I think there is conspiracy out there,

01:25.600 --> 01:28.720
but they get you hooked on the fake ones
to distract from the real ones.

01:28.800 --> 01:32.800
Okay. So I'm not just some smelly old guy.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.720
No, you are quite smelly.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.200
I'm concerned that you
don't really wash yourself,

01:38.280 --> 01:40.080
like, you know, with soap.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.880
Soap? What?

01:42.400 --> 01:46.360
No one needs soap.
That's all propaganda from big soap.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.680
Everyone needs soap.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.440
We're gonna have to put
a pin in that, okay?

01:50.520 --> 01:54.600
'Cause we are so close
to exposing these jackoffs.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.720
Can't you smell it?

01:56.800 --> 01:59.120
I literally haven't inhaled
in three hours.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.280
All right. Come on.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.600
-Come on, kid, where are ya?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.000
-Where are ya?

02:06.920 --> 02:09.800
Oh! Oh my God! I smell something for sure.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.440
-It wasn't me, kid.

02:11.520 --> 02:13.200
-Roll down the window.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.360
What?

02:18.440 --> 02:20.080
I told you he was following me!

02:23.000 --> 02:26.520
-"You'll never expose the…"

02:32.120 --> 02:37.920
<i> In 1984, four schoolboys</i>
<i>meet a young girl called Eleven</i>

02:38.000 --> 02:40.960
<i>and discover a place</i>
<i>called the Upside Down.</i>

02:41.640 --> 02:45.240
<i>You see, you've got to pay attention,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

02:45.720 --> 02:47.200
<i>That's </i>Stranger Things.

02:48.160 --> 02:49.600
<i>And this show's called</i>

02:50.240 --> 02:51.240
The Pentaverate,

02:51.320 --> 02:53.960
<i>about a secret society who are nice.</i>

02:54.040 --> 02:56.480

<i>Well, you've done three</i>

02:58.920 --> 03:01.320

03:07.440 --> 03:10.520

03:10.600 --> 03:12.360
<i>Speed, Mach 3.</i>

03:23.000 --> 03:25.680
Hold onto your lunch!

03:37.360 --> 03:38.920
-Whoo!

03:39.520 --> 03:41.040
You enjoy that, kid?

03:42.280 --> 03:45.160
Come on, let's go get that key! Hoo-ah!

03:53.400 --> 03:54.240
This way, kid.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.400
All right, Ken,
I'm gonna need you to focus.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.800
We gotta get in there and get that key.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.720
There's Dubrovnik Castle.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.400
That's where the Parce Clavem is.

04:25.480 --> 04:26.360
Ah.

04:26.440 --> 04:29.480
May the ogre accept your net of regrets.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.520
Oh, right, because of the Festival
of the Ogre of Dubrovnik.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.760
Every year, the townspeople
offer their nets of regret

04:35.840 --> 04:38.000
to the Ogre of Dubrovnik for absolution.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.120
-Oh, that's interesting.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.080
Shit, it's Sasquatch!
We gotta lose him, Ken.

04:43.160 --> 04:45.720
-Move out of the way.
-Get out of the way!

04:45.800 --> 04:46.800
We gotta go. Sorry!

04:46.880 --> 04:51.800
You go find the fortune-teller's shop,
and I'll try and lead him down this alley.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.600
I can't run too good on account
I got necrosis of the left testis.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.080
From a western?

04:57.160 --> 05:00.520
No, it's from when I was
stunt coordinator on <i>The Golden Girls.</i>

05:00.600 --> 05:01.880
Fuck Estelle Getty!

05:01.960 --> 05:05.360
-Okay.
-One important thing. Don't touch the key.

05:05.440 --> 05:08.000
-Don't touch the key?
-Don't touch the key! Now go!

05:08.080 --> 05:10.360
Don't touch the key. Don't touch the key.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.720
Hoo-ah! Hoo-ah!

05:14.800 --> 05:16.640
-Oh shit, there it goes.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.600
Excuse me, sorry. Excuse me.
Sorry, ma'am. Sorry, excuse me.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.520
Sorry. Oh! Excuse me.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.480
There is the Ogre of Dubrovnik!

05:31.560 --> 05:33.360
Ogre! Ogre!

05:33.440 --> 05:36.480
-Please accept my net of regrets.
-Here's my net! Here's--

05:53.480 --> 05:57.760
I've got this one,
laddie. I'm the real Ogre of Dubrovnik.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.440
Now get out of my swamp!

06:02.600 --> 06:03.480
And stay down!

06:05.280 --> 06:07.080
-Thanks, Shrek.
-You're welcome, laddie.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.160
Ogre!

07:43.440 --> 07:47.480
Welcome to my hall of mirrors,

07:47.560 --> 07:49.600
Ken Scarborough.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.000
Who said that?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.960
-I did.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.040
Who are you?

07:56.440 --> 07:59.760
I am the Saester of Dubrovnik.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.840
Oh, like the Maester of Dubrovnik.

08:02.920 --> 08:06.240
I am the Maester's saester.
The Maester is my braester.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.920
Well, I have some very bad news,
I'm afraid.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.240
The Maester is dead.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.440
Believed to be murdered.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.920
My kid braester dead?

08:17.600 --> 08:20.480
This is a disaester!

08:20.560 --> 08:24.560
Well, I'm very sorry about that, but…
What the hell? What the…

08:25.680 --> 08:30.760
Has anybody contacted
our maether and our faether?

08:30.840 --> 08:32.000
I… I don't know what you're…

08:33.800 --> 08:35.920
I… I wish I could, uh… Oh!

08:36.000 --> 08:37.240
Okay, sure.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.680
-Ow! Ow!

08:39.760 --> 08:43.320
And we have two caesins in Kaiserslautern.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.360
Do the Kaiserslautern caesins
know about my braester, the Maester?

08:48.440 --> 08:50.720
Ma'am, I'm very sorry for your loss,

08:50.800 --> 08:54.680
but I'm actually here
on official Pentaverate business.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.920
Is this about the copier?

09:00.000 --> 09:02.720
Did Katie from HR send you?

09:02.800 --> 09:03.880
What?

09:03.960 --> 09:05.720
Oh, nothing, nothing.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.760
I'm searching for the Parce Clavem.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.880
Ah, well, it isn't here.
You've wasted your time.

09:10.960 --> 09:12.040
Good day!

09:13.880 --> 09:14.920
Hello?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.080
Saester?

09:16.920 --> 09:19.880
I happen to know for a fact
that the key is here.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.800
Damn, you are good.

09:22.880 --> 09:26.280
I am keeper of Parce Clavem.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.200
It's Latin for--

09:28.280 --> 09:29.400
Spare key.

09:29.960 --> 09:32.800
Damn, you are good.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.680
Ken Scarborough,

09:34.760 --> 09:40.720
look into the mirror… r… r… r…

09:40.800 --> 09:42.520
What do you see?

09:43.280 --> 09:44.760
I see Ken Scarborough.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.400
And who is that?

09:47.960 --> 09:49.640
Just a nice Canadian guy.

09:50.640 --> 09:54.120
Drink from the Chalice of Malice.

09:54.200 --> 09:58.960
From the decanter
springs forth mean banter.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.000
Sip from the cup,

10:01.520 --> 10:04.200
your anger will erupt.

10:08.040 --> 10:11.280
Being kind no longer an excuse

10:11.360 --> 10:15.520
when your veins course
with angry juice! 5

10:15.600 --> 10:17.160
I don't want to be angry!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.040
I want to be nice!

10:22.560 --> 10:25.120
Pick up the gun.
You'll never hit this nun.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.120
The mirror gives deception.
You'll miss my direction.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.400
Well, I'm not gonna shoot a nun.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.160
Hit your target to retrieve the key,

10:34.240 --> 10:36.560
or I will dispose of thee!

10:36.640 --> 10:40.240
-Okay, uh…

10:43.120 --> 10:45.160
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

10:45.680 --> 10:48.000
Whoa! Jesus, what have you done?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.800
You told me to shoot you!

10:49.880 --> 10:51.120
With all these fucking mirrors,

10:51.200 --> 10:53.840
you're not supposed
to get it right first time, are you?

10:53.920 --> 10:55.480
There's 30 fucking mirrors here.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.120
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

10:57.200 --> 10:59.040
Just take your fucking key and fuck off.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.360
What about your leg?

11:00.440 --> 11:03.120
Yes, well, I'm calling an ambulance.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.320
Oh God. You know
I'm gonna have to pay for this?

11:06.400 --> 11:09.680
'Cause I can hardly put "Pentaverate"
on the insurance claim, can I?

11:09.760 --> 11:12.680
Put down that gun, Dick fucking Cheney.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.360
And be gone with you. Fuck off.

11:14.440 --> 11:16.520
-Christ.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.440
Ow!

11:18.040 --> 11:21.440
-That stings.
-It's fusing with your DNA, you dipshit.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.880
I mean, it really hurt.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.400
Oh, does it really hurt?
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.600
Well, it hurts more
than being shot in the leg?

11:27.680 --> 11:30.800
Hurts more than being told
your brother's been murdered?

11:30.880 --> 11:33.160
Be gone with you, you silly old prick.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.080
-Yes, hello. Ambulance, please.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.200
-Sorry.
-Hall of mirrors.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.680
Yes, again.

12:28.480 --> 12:32.040
-'Cause I believe in the Pentaverate.
-Join us in protecting the world.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.960
The Liechtenstein Guard
are a band of brothers.

12:35.040 --> 12:37.240
They do some
pretty good things though, eh?

12:37.320 --> 12:41.080
-We've already replaced ya.
-Did you know that dolphins can queef?

13:08.520 --> 13:09.400
Hello?

13:12.440 --> 13:13.400
Hello!

13:25.800 --> 13:28.480
I believe
you have the Parce Clavem.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.840
Yes, I do.

13:29.920 --> 13:31.640
Hand it over, please.

13:32.440 --> 13:36.840
You stand before us
accused of crimes against the Pentaverate.

13:36.920 --> 13:37.920
What crimes?

13:38.480 --> 13:40.000
You steal Parce Clavem.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.200
I didn't steal it! I brought it back.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.800
You touched it. You wrecked it.
Only you can use it now.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.320
Read the charges.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.920
The charges are as follows.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.920
Theft of the Parce Clavem.

13:51.000 --> 13:51.960
Two counts of murder.

13:52.040 --> 13:55.600
-Jason Eccleston and Professor Clark.
-Murder? I didn't murder anybody!

13:55.680 --> 13:56.640
Silence!

13:56.720 --> 14:02.160
We know your true identity.
Canadian journalist Ken Scarborough.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.360
Bring us the SD card.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.440
MENTOR!

14:16.800 --> 14:19.760
<i>Here we are at the Pentaverate.</i>
<i>There's plenty of things to do--</i>

14:19.840 --> 14:23.480
-<i>You were born in your mother's ass.</i>

14:27.120 --> 14:29.400
<i> Whee! I'm gonna write my name.</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:32.160
-<i>K-E-N.</i>

14:32.240 --> 14:34.240
Yeah, like you've never done that.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.800
I hate to be a bore,
but is there enough evidence to convict?

14:38.880 --> 14:41.520
We should comb through
all the footage first.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.200
Cube him in the meantime.

14:43.280 --> 14:44.840
-Seconded.
-Resolved.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.160
Ken shall be cubed.
Have you anything to say?

14:48.240 --> 14:50.280
Yeah. Where's Higgins?

14:50.880 --> 14:52.320
What happened to Higgins?

14:55.360 --> 14:56.200
My God.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.200
Behold the head of a traitor.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.560
Higgins let a journalist
in the Liechtenstein Guard, and of course…

15:04.640 --> 15:07.000
The Pentaverate
must never be exposed.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.200
Cube him! Cube him!
Cube him! Cube him!

15:10.280 --> 15:11.960
What… what's going on here?

15:12.840 --> 15:14.280
Where are you taking me?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.800
<i>It is officially nighttime.</i>

15:33.880 --> 15:36.600
<i>I'm Maria Menounos for Pentaverate TV,</i>

15:36.680 --> 15:39.400
<i>reminding you that tomorrow</i>
<i>is The Meadows,</i>

15:39.480 --> 15:41.120
<i>the biggest event of the year.</i>

15:41.200 --> 15:43.440
<i>And now, tonight's movie is…</i>

15:44.760 --> 15:46.040
…Face/Off.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.000
<i>Good night, Pentaverate HQ.</i>

16:10.680 --> 16:11.920
Schnell!

16:18.600 --> 16:20.720
I was trying to help!

16:44.560 --> 16:46.160
Are you gonna kill me?

17:27.840 --> 17:30.640
You expect me to fly that helicopter?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.880
Well, how did you know that?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.360
Well, that's a fine how-do-you-do.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.560
-Reilly, you're here!

18:01.120 --> 18:03.280
-How did you get here?
-I was knocked out.

18:03.360 --> 18:05.880
The guy with the mustache
told me to get in the helicopter.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.200
Alrighty, well, buckle up.
I haven't flown one of these in years.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.880
-All right, we're heading back to Toronto.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.560
Holy jumpin',
do I have a story to tell.

18:17.640 --> 18:18.920
All right, let's go.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.560
-You ready? Here we go!
-Yeah.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.800
CACA, here we come!

18:28.960 --> 18:31.560
-Whoo!

18:43.200 --> 18:45.360
Over there is where Alex Trebek lives.

18:45.440 --> 18:46.320
-He's--
-Canadian.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.920
-That's right, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.840
And Celine Dion.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.440
-She's Canadian.
-That's right.

18:51.040 --> 18:53.920
And over there is Bill Pemberton.
You know him.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.880
-No.
-He invented the squeegee.

18:55.960 --> 18:56.800
Canadian.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.600
Get up!

19:18.680 --> 19:20.600
Okay, Ken, what are you doing?

19:20.680 --> 19:23.360
I'm not doing anything.
It's got a mind of its own!

19:23.440 --> 19:24.360
Come on!

19:25.400 --> 19:27.200
Who's controlling this?

19:33.800 --> 19:36.560
Are we gonna die?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.520
-Ouch!
-Jeez, let me go!

20:13.600 --> 20:15.120
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

20:15.200 --> 20:16.520
What is happening?

20:16.600 --> 20:18.360
Where are you taking us?

20:21.080 --> 20:23.400
Hello, dickwad and friend.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.240
Greetings and fuck-utations.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.080
Wacky Skip Cho here.

20:28.720 --> 20:31.520
Fun time is over, Ken Scarborough.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.320
Because it is time

20:33.920 --> 20:35.120
for you to help us.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.360
Help you?

20:36.960 --> 20:38.760
Don't be so naive.

20:40.040 --> 20:41.320
I'm the bad guy.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.720
Duh.

21:07.000 --> 21:07.840
Duh.
