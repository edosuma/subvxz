We have rules for training.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.666
And the reason
that we have rules...

this is gymnastics.

14:35.530 --> 14:37.898
Now... Well, you know
about your daughter.

14:37.932 --> 14:40.535
Your daughter is
the best one, I've gotta say.

14:40.568 --> 14:43.070
I've never seen
anything quite like her.

14:43.103 --> 14:45.740
We'd like to fast-track her
towards becoming an elite.

14:49.076 --> 14:51.245
- [woman] She's six.
- Oh...

14:51.278 --> 14:54.915
I've got two other kids.
That is a big commitment.

14:54.949 --> 14:58.719
We'd have her nationally ranked
by the time she's ten.

14:58.753 --> 15:01.556
Olympic track by age 13.
That's the gold.

15:01.589 --> 15:05.926

- Did I say gold? [laughs]

15:08.128 --> 15:09.697
Well, you see?

I guess Madison and gold
are becoming synonymous for me.

have the check Tuesday.

15:18.172 --> 15:21.476

You got a lot of people
going to the Olympics.

represent? State of Delusion?

It's so hot outside.

15:50.037 --> 15:54.108
Vick! When can we scrap
the old long-sleeve leotards?

15:54.141 --> 15:56.276
We need new ones
for championships.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.779
Every college
will be scouting me.

15:58.813 --> 16:00.414
[scoffing]

16:00.447 --> 16:03.283
Not that you have
to worry about any of that.

16:03.317 --> 16:06.621
New leotard might distract,
you know, the judges and scouts

16:06.654 --> 16:10.591
from your lack of talent.
It's a solid strategy.

16:10.625 --> 16:14.662
Gee, Pariah Carey, I wonder
why no one's scouting you.

16:16.296 --> 16:18.866
Oh, I forgot, you don't matter.

16:23.237 --> 16:25.272
That she can even
say the word "college"

16:25.305 --> 16:27.508
is an indictment against
the whole institution.

16:27.542 --> 16:30.645
Hey, Filibuster,
no one cares.

16:30.678 --> 16:35.516

throwing off your routines.

see the last one?

16:51.832 --> 16:56.370

16:56.403 --> 16:59.239

Bring back memories?

16:59.273 --> 17:01.542
We trained together
at Defrank's for how long?

17:01.576 --> 17:04.044
That would be, uh...
too long.

17:04.078 --> 17:08.182
And he'd give you so much
attention because you sucked.

17:09.016 --> 17:10.317
Right.

17:10.349 --> 17:12.819
Yeah, I sucked
my way to Worlds.

17:12.853 --> 17:16.991
Glad to see you haven't lost
your love of accuracy, Joanne.

17:17.023 --> 17:21.161
Well, at least I didn't make it
all the way to Worlds and...

17:21.194 --> 17:23.698
...um, choke.

17:23.731 --> 17:26.701
[chuckling] Here,
let me show you how,

17:26.733 --> 17:28.669
- you little...
- [screaming]

17:28.703 --> 17:30.838
[woman] Hey!
Stop right now! Stop it!

17:30.871 --> 17:35.743
I said, pointy feet,
not pointy words.

17:35.776 --> 17:39.346
Pointy words
are mouth turds. God!

17:39.379 --> 17:41.716
- [woman muttering]
- I'm OK. She's crazy.

17:41.749 --> 17:44.118
I'm so jealous of Joanne
that I've actually

17:44.151 --> 17:46.453
already memorized
her preschool beam routine.

17:46.486 --> 17:49.456
Hey, easy.
I choreographed that routine.

17:49.489 --> 17:51.892
[mimicking accent]
Your secret is safe with me.

17:54.061 --> 17:56.430
[humming]

17:56.463 --> 17:59.767
We got some finger-flickin'
good choreography.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.136
And the classic butt shelf.

18:02.169 --> 18:05.139
[pretends to fart]
Joanne, how embarrassing.

18:05.172 --> 18:08.075
Then we have some
useless bits of fluff

18:08.108 --> 18:10.911
to get us from
point A to point B.

18:10.945 --> 18:14.481
And induces the urge to vacuum.

18:14.514 --> 18:17.284
[whirring]

18:18.585 --> 18:21.221
- Mina, right?
- Yeah, Mina.

18:21.255 --> 18:23.157
Mina, put down the phone.

18:23.190 --> 18:24.458
[Haley] Can you tell Joanne

18:24.491 --> 18:26.627
that I'm gonna take over
and do a real dismount?

18:26.661 --> 18:29.964
Joanne, Haley's on the phone.
She's gonna do a real dismount.

18:29.997 --> 18:31.832
I heard her, thank you.

18:31.866 --> 18:34.468
How 'bout a double back?

18:34.501 --> 18:37.304
You will not throw a double back
without training it first.

18:37.337 --> 18:39.907
- [Haley] Close your eyes.
- Over my dead body.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.643
- Little CPR might do you good.
- [Vick] Haley!

18:46.180 --> 18:47.281
[gasping]

18:47.314 --> 18:49.684
[chuckling]

18:49.717 --> 18:51.085
[Haley] Ahh...

18:51.118 --> 18:54.855
Shall we share our philosophy
with Haley, ladies?

18:54.889 --> 18:58.826
Speak my mind.
What are we about?

18:58.859 --> 19:02.663
[all] Clean, safe routines,
guaranteed to stick.

19:02.697 --> 19:04.865
[retching]

19:04.899 --> 19:08.368
Is he keeping
your brains in jars?

19:08.402 --> 19:10.771
Or should I be concerned
about the water?

19:10.805 --> 19:13.640
[Vick] Shall we show Haley
what discipline is all about?

19:13.674 --> 19:15.542
Please join us, Haley.

19:15.575 --> 19:19.814
Ehh. No, thanks.
I'm kinda tired.

19:19.847 --> 19:24.384
Oh, all right. Fine.
Ladies, outside, now!

19:26.486 --> 19:28.155
Point your toes, ladies.

19:30.691 --> 19:34.328
You're gonna keep going
until Haley participates.

19:34.361 --> 19:37.231
This is, like,
globally unfair.

19:37.264 --> 19:41.635
- We're gonna be here all night.
- Lift your knees... Joanne.

19:41.668 --> 19:45.039
[Joanne] This is totally
violating the penile code.

19:48.208 --> 19:50.210
[rattling]

19:52.612 --> 19:54.281
Hey!

19:55.449 --> 19:57.684
Hey! You guys.

19:57.718 --> 20:00.187
What, do you want me
to pick the lock, or what?

20:00.220 --> 20:02.522
Can you come let me in?

20:02.556 --> 20:05.192
Oh, right. Thank you.

20:05.225 --> 20:07.795
- [girl] Get lost!
- [sighing]

20:18.438 --> 20:20.440
[car approaching]

20:23.077 --> 20:26.080
Haley, let's go for a drive.

20:27.547 --> 20:29.716
- ...deserve to be.
- A what?

20:29.750 --> 20:31.618
Thank you, Lorelei,
that was delicious.

20:31.651 --> 20:33.954
Actually, you know what?
I'm gonna finish this off...

20:33.988 --> 20:35.555
- No, no.
- ...if that's OK.

20:35.589 --> 20:37.892
- Thank you.
- Are you serious?

20:37.925 --> 20:39.626
I heard you were
strict about diet,

20:39.659 --> 20:41.428
but this is just rude.

20:41.461 --> 20:44.131
Hey, you piss where I eat,
you don't eat.

20:44.164 --> 20:45.632
Oh, but you do?

20:45.665 --> 20:47.634
What, does this mean
you're eating my piss?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.669
Well, that's disgusting.

20:50.670 --> 20:52.807
[sighing]

20:52.840 --> 20:55.309
What a charming
young lady you are.

20:55.342 --> 20:57.077
Yeah, that's
what they say.

20:57.111 --> 20:59.146
[exhaling deeply]

20:59.179 --> 21:02.116
Listen, I don't suppose,
uh, college gymnastics

21:02.149 --> 21:03.818
is on your to-do list,
right?

21:03.851 --> 21:07.054
Correct. College gymnastics
is one big fat to-don't.

21:07.087 --> 21:08.989
Great. Then in
addition to sparing

21:09.023 --> 21:12.059
innocent collegiate
gymnastics coaches everywhere,

21:12.092 --> 21:13.427
you can keep
any purse money

21:13.460 --> 21:15.095
that you might win,
free and clear.

21:15.129 --> 21:17.898
I'm not competing
or training again. Ever.

21:17.932 --> 21:21.902
Oh, you're gonna piss off
the judge and kiss 18 goodbye?

21:21.936 --> 21:24.004
I guess.

21:25.705 --> 21:28.775
- Hey.
- What the...?

21:28.809 --> 21:31.478
The IG Classic is
comin' up in a month.

21:31.511 --> 21:33.247
Now, you apply yourself,

21:33.280 --> 21:35.315
you could win
some restitution money.

21:35.349 --> 21:37.484
It could get ya outta here.
What do you think?

21:37.517 --> 21:39.653
I think if you showed up
at the Classic with me

21:39.686 --> 21:41.655
an angry mob would
probably cut your brakes.

21:41.688 --> 21:43.157
- I got insurance.
- Really?

21:43.190 --> 21:44.925
Well, no, thank you.

21:44.959 --> 21:47.194
This sport is a total joke.

21:47.227 --> 21:49.529
You know this.

21:49.563 --> 21:52.933
Sorry to dis your
life's work and all. No offense.

21:52.967 --> 21:54.634
Hey, none taken.

21:54.668 --> 21:57.437
There's nothin' fair about
a girl landing a double pike

21:57.471 --> 21:59.940
and losing a tenth 'cause
her toes weren't pointed.

21:59.974 --> 22:02.977
Nothin' fair about judges
who don't have instant replay,

22:03.010 --> 22:04.678
and they're lookin'
for perfection.

22:04.711 --> 22:07.014
Can you imagine football
without instant replay?

22:07.047 --> 22:08.883
- What about the rules?
- It'd be mayhem.

22:08.916 --> 22:10.484
The Code of Point?
Hey...

22:10.517 --> 22:13.553
Yeah. I mean, it makes
conventionality good
and innovation bad.

22:14.188 --> 22:15.555
What's the point?

22:15.589 --> 22:17.958
How 'bout the fact
that you were one

22:17.992 --> 22:21.128
of the greatest natural talents
the sport's ever seen? Hmm?

22:21.161 --> 22:23.330
C'mon, you coulda been great.

22:23.363 --> 22:25.665
[chuckling] You're
not actually pushing

22:25.699 --> 22:27.501
the "you coulda
been great" speech.

22:27.534 --> 22:30.170
You are a total cliché.
You realize that, right?

22:30.204 --> 22:33.207
Oh, OK, come on, uh,
Original Recipe, let's hear it.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.808
You give me the speech.

22:34.841 --> 22:37.144
Fine. Uh...

22:37.177 --> 22:38.512
Talent out of the ass.

22:38.545 --> 22:40.814
Natural ability that
half the world's gymnasts

22:40.847 --> 22:42.917
would kill for, and
you're flushing it away.

22:42.950 --> 22:44.584
Don't flush
your life away, kid.

22:44.618 --> 22:47.054
Step away from the bowl.

22:47.087 --> 22:49.023
Whatever.

22:51.291 --> 22:55.062
Well, you got
the words right anyway.

22:55.095 --> 22:59.366
I wasn't great.
I was obedient.

23:01.401 --> 23:03.703
I'm sick and tired
of being judged.

23:03.737 --> 23:05.539
I don't need it.

23:11.745 --> 23:15.015
- Fascinating.
- What?

23:15.049 --> 23:17.084
For someone who
hates being judged,

23:17.117 --> 23:19.619
you're one of the most
judgmental people I've ever met.

23:19.653 --> 23:20.654
Come on.

23:29.296 --> 23:31.598
Well, it's only about
five miles to the gym.

23:31.631 --> 23:33.767
Just down here.
Hang a right at the gas station.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.435
I know how to get back.

23:35.469 --> 23:37.004
Oh, good. Hey.

23:38.338 --> 23:40.074
Hey, Miss Rebel
Without Applause.

23:40.107 --> 23:42.442
Tell you what...

23:42.476 --> 23:45.812
...you choose to compete in the
IG Classic, you can come back.

23:45.845 --> 23:47.581
How's that?

23:51.251 --> 23:53.553
Hike'll give you a chance
to think things over.

23:53.587 --> 23:55.722
Yeah, well, what if I
choose not to come back?

23:55.755 --> 23:58.125
Haley...

23:58.158 --> 24:00.060
...tell you the truth...

24:00.094 --> 24:03.230
- [car starts]
- ...nobody cares.

24:03.263 --> 24:05.265
Nobody cares what ya do.

24:12.539 --> 24:14.108
Wait.

24:17.044 --> 24:19.046
I don't...

24:21.481 --> 24:23.717
I have nowhere else to go.

24:24.851 --> 24:29.323
Yeah, I know.

[* My Morning Jacket:
One Big Holiday]

25:14.868 --> 25:16.736
- [Haley] Hey.
- Ew.

25:16.770 --> 25:18.205
[Haley] What?

25:21.675 --> 25:23.543
[Haley sighs]

25:23.577 --> 25:25.745
Oh, how was
your run last night?

25:25.779 --> 25:28.048
- Oh, fantastic, thank you.
- Yeah?

25:28.082 --> 25:30.150
Listen, are you
being serious with me?

25:30.184 --> 25:32.752
Because I've had enough
of lunatic adults for a while.

25:32.786 --> 25:35.255
- I'll do what I said I'd do.
- For real.

25:35.289 --> 25:37.257
I'll train you
for the Classic.

25:37.291 --> 25:38.358
Help you win the purse.

25:38.392 --> 25:40.327
Great. So then
here's the deal:

25:40.360 --> 25:43.830
Uh, I'm not struggling
in front of those robots.

25:43.863 --> 25:45.432
[Vick] All right.
I'll let you

25:45.465 --> 25:48.001
train at the old gym till
you're ready to face the music.

25:48.034 --> 25:49.669
- How's that?
- You're gonna trust me

25:49.703 --> 25:51.905
to be in there alone
and if anything happens,

25:51.938 --> 25:53.973
- I don't wanna hear...
- I got insurance.

25:55.542 --> 25:57.777
Come on, get goin'.
You're in training, kid.

25:57.811 --> 25:59.779
- Get goin'!
- What are you talking about?

25:59.813 --> 26:03.783
No, I'm... We just discussed...
I... You suck!

[* Green Day: Brain Stew]

26:12.159 --> 26:16.296
[Haley] Gymnastics
tells you "no" all day long.

26:16.330 --> 26:19.099
It mocks you
over and over again.

26:19.133 --> 26:20.900
Telling you, you're an idiot.

26:20.934 --> 26:23.570
That you're crazy.

If you like running full speed
towards a stationary object,

26:26.340 --> 26:29.109

26:34.181 --> 26:35.815
the size of quarters
off your hands,

26:38.785 --> 26:40.820
Because the only thing
more fun than rips

26:40.854 --> 26:43.089
- is when your rips get rips.

Are you serious?

26:48.195 --> 26:50.630
I mean, who doesn't wanna
parade around in a leotard

26:50.664 --> 26:53.167

doing dorky choreography?

[screaming]

26:54.634 --> 26:57.171
It's delicious.

27:18.858 --> 27:20.194
[Haley] If you like falling,

then gymnastics
is the sport for you.

27:22.896 --> 27:23.930
Oh!

27:23.963 --> 27:25.765
You get to fall on your face,

your ass, your back,
your knees and your pride.

27:31.471 --> 27:32.506

27:33.740 --> 27:36.310
Good thing
I didn't like falling.

27:36.343 --> 27:37.744
[in melody] I loved it!

27:46.686 --> 27:48.655
Hey.

27:48.688 --> 27:50.790
This mean you can
finally walk again?

27:50.824 --> 27:53.159
Or should we keep the
icemaker on overdrive?

Question, they say
those who can't do, coach.

27:56.996 --> 27:59.233
So I was wondering,
what's your excuse?

27:59.266 --> 28:02.168
Ha, ha, ha. No excuse.

28:02.202 --> 28:05.339
Missed a release move on
high bar, fractured my spine.

28:05.372 --> 28:07.407
No biggie.

you know,
things were different.

Threw a layout.
Threw a full. And, uh...

tellin' you this story.

28:29.696 --> 28:31.898
It's not even a story.
It's a nonevent.

Huh. You were scared.

Ow! Ow.

No. I was done.

28:41.775 --> 28:43.843
I know exactly
what that feels like.

28:43.877 --> 28:45.512
You chose to be done.

28:45.545 --> 28:47.547
I didn't choose it,
my body did.

28:48.982 --> 28:50.016
Well, you know,

28:50.049 --> 28:51.851
I think you should get
back on the tramp.

28:51.885 --> 28:53.520
To make sure you
still suck, ya know?

tackle the guard? You're bigger.

- These yours?

30:06.560 --> 30:09.095
- [Haley] Holy shit!
- Damn.

30:09.128 --> 30:12.999
- What are you guys doing here?
- What's up? Cracker.

30:13.032 --> 30:16.269
- Juvy, huh? You call this juvy?
- Hmm.

30:16.302 --> 30:18.805
OK, trust me, Poot, this is
hard time, OK? He's crazy.

30:18.838 --> 30:20.039
- Yeah.
- You've no idea.

30:20.073 --> 30:21.641
We had maneuvers.
Check this out.

30:21.675 --> 30:24.043
OK, boys.
Time to go.

30:24.077 --> 30:25.345
- We're cool. Thanks.
- Yeah.

have visiting hours.

outta the moms next door.

Please. Those mommies
were totally hitting on us.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hitting on us?

30:35.054 --> 30:37.691

Mommies and me.

It's the devil's candy, boys.
Trust me. Say goodbye.

you been doing?

- Probably riding a ton.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.502
[Haley] The only reason
I'm doing these tricks

31:22.536 --> 31:24.270
is because somebody
somewhere said,

31:24.303 --> 31:27.040
"I don't care if this is nuts,
and I don't care if it hurts.

31:27.073 --> 31:28.442
I'm doing it.

insanely high mountain.

a new mountain in gymnastics,

it all the way to Worlds
and walking out?

It's totally insane.

31:51.064 --> 31:53.967
I heard she was tanking her
double pikes in warm-ups.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.869
I think she just choked.

to tell about it? Come here.

- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am. Know what?

If you think I'm getting
on the competition floor

cookie-cutter routine,

32:53.392 --> 32:55.128

- No.
- Do you wanna keep it that way,

ambulance on call for ya?

33:01.501 --> 33:03.202
Call 'em up.

33:04.003 --> 33:06.640
Do a handstand. Now.

33:10.510 --> 33:13.479
You're pushin' it.

33:13.513 --> 33:16.783
Let your clutch out slower.
Get some traction.

33:16.816 --> 33:19.185
That way you won't be
fishtailing all over the place.

33:19.218 --> 33:20.954
You won't crash.

33:20.987 --> 33:24.524
- Stop flooring it.
- Way to build trust.

to play it safe,

to go for the Americans,

Instead, she stunned
her teammates, spectators

34:00.927 --> 34:04.598

walking out of the arena

34:04.631 --> 34:07.333
and into an automatic
disqualification.

34:07.366 --> 34:09.002
Why'd she walk out?

of teammate Tricia Skilken

of gold melted away.

200 elite gymnasts.

It's just this sticky stuff
you spray on your butt

59:08.866 --> 59:10.235
so the leotard doesn't ride up.

59:10.268 --> 59:12.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can I get that job?
I wanna be Tuf-Skin.

59:12.870 --> 59:14.406
- Shut up.
- Hey.

59:14.439 --> 59:15.907
What would happen
if you put

59:15.940 --> 59:18.410
some of that Tuf-Skin
stuff on tough skin?

59:18.443 --> 59:20.245
Your head would
stick to your butt.

59:20.278 --> 59:22.380
Why would my head
stick to my butt?

59:22.414 --> 59:25.383
'Cause your head's
already up there! Ah!

59:25.417 --> 59:28.286
Don't worry, Frank...

59:28.320 --> 59:30.688
...my head's up my butt too.

59:30.722 --> 59:32.924
Far.

59:41.733 --> 59:44.001
Oh. Have a seat, Haley.

59:45.903 --> 59:48.640
I'd like you to read something
for me, please, out loud.

59:48.673 --> 59:50.508
Second paragraph.

59:52.510 --> 59:55.380
Uh... "The gymnastics world,
like the real world,

59:55.413 --> 59:57.482
can be a very unforgiving place.

59:57.515 --> 59:58.983
As I know all too well,

59:59.016 --> 01:00:01.153
there might be too much
chalk on the blackboard

01:00:01.186 --> 01:00:02.420
for her to get a clean slate,

01:00:02.454 --> 01:00:04.622
competing with me
or anyone else.

01:00:04.656 --> 01:00:08.426
And Haley has earned
the right to a clean slate.

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:10.995
She's quite capable of
deciding what's best for her.

01:00:11.028 --> 01:00:13.598
And I encourage the court
to include her perspective

01:00:13.631 --> 01:00:16.934
in its decision.
Sincerely, Burt Vickerman."

01:00:18.836 --> 01:00:21.105
[laughs]

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:24.242
That's all, Haley.
You're free to go.

01:00:24.276 --> 01:00:26.578
What about the restitution?

01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:28.946
Oh, that's been taken care of.

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:30.982
Be good.

01:00:31.015 --> 01:00:32.850
Sounds like
you're built for it.

01:00:35.119 --> 01:00:36.521
Thank you.

01:00:41.493 --> 01:00:42.794
You know, Haley,

01:00:42.827 --> 01:00:45.963
there are a lot
of great people

01:00:45.997 --> 01:00:49.033
who had jerks for parents.

01:00:50.168 --> 01:00:53.137
We gotta stick together.

01:00:53.171 --> 01:00:56.374
[rock music]

01:00:58.142 --> 01:01:01.513
- [Haley] The tights?
- [Poot] What are they?
In Special Ed?

01:01:01.546 --> 01:01:02.880
- You'd know, huh?
- Nice.

01:01:02.914 --> 01:01:04.549
- Whatever.
- [chuckling]

01:01:04.582 --> 01:01:06.318
Hey, guys,
I have a gut feelin'

01:01:06.351 --> 01:01:07.819
somethin' bad's
gonna happen.

01:01:07.852 --> 01:01:09.821
- What?
- What do you mean, dude?

01:01:09.854 --> 01:01:11.389
[farts]

01:01:11.423 --> 01:01:15.860
Oh! Dude,
keep it over there!

01:01:17.028 --> 01:01:18.563
Whoo!

01:01:18.596 --> 01:01:21.533
- Oh!
- [Frank] What? I can't hold it.

01:01:22.434 --> 01:01:24.636
Stay tight in the air.

01:01:24.669 --> 01:01:27.705
Oh, nice! Nice. Nice.

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:33.978
[sighing]

01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:37.181
You got through an entire letter
without using the word "gold."

01:01:37.215 --> 01:01:39.183
- It was tough.
- [laughing]

01:01:39.217 --> 01:01:41.353
And the restitution.
I mean, was that...?

01:01:41.386 --> 01:01:44.589
Dev?
Give us a sec, would ya?

01:01:46.023 --> 01:01:48.226
[clearing throat]

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.062
Look, don't... uh, don't
read anything into it.

01:01:51.095 --> 01:01:52.830
- You didn't have to do that.
- I...

01:01:52.864 --> 01:01:55.567
I paid with your father's money.

01:01:58.035 --> 01:02:00.772
You know what? I, uh...

01:02:00.805 --> 01:02:04.876
[clears throat]
I completely misjudged you.

01:02:06.278 --> 01:02:09.046
[sighs] Hmm.

01:02:14.419 --> 01:02:17.522
I've decided I'm gonna
take you to Championships.

01:02:17.555 --> 01:02:19.591
You know, show you
how to really do it.

01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:21.559
Come on,
you're high on chalk.

01:02:21.593 --> 01:02:23.027
[laughing]

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:25.897
Who even said you could stay?
I didn't say you could stay.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:26.964
- Haley!
- Hey, Mina.

01:02:26.998 --> 01:02:28.733
- Hey.
- Hey, Wei Wei.

01:02:28.766 --> 01:02:29.934
- We're so sorry.
- Yeah.

01:02:29.967 --> 01:02:31.603
Joanne kind of
misrepresented...

01:02:31.636 --> 01:02:33.771
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, I understand.

01:02:33.805 --> 01:02:36.308
Listen, I'll stay
on one condition.

01:02:36.341 --> 01:02:37.642
Oh, this I gotta hear.

01:02:37.675 --> 01:02:40.412
Does it involve you
and self-imposed silence?

01:02:40.445 --> 01:02:41.713
Get back on the tramp.

01:02:41.746 --> 01:02:44.316
[Haley] You girls
wanna see Vick do a layout?

01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:46.318
He's so, like, old, though.

01:02:46.351 --> 01:02:48.420
- Hey.
- [Mina] Uh, he
might break a hip.

01:02:48.453 --> 01:02:52.590
No. He'll be fine.
Come on.

01:02:52.624 --> 01:02:55.827
I'll go to Championships if
you get on the tramp right now,

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.329
and you do a layout.

01:02:57.362 --> 01:02:59.664
- It's your call.
- Don't do it, Vick.

01:02:59.697 --> 01:03:01.899
This is a really bad idea.

01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:03.301
Come on, Vick.

01:03:03.335 --> 01:03:06.471
[girls] Vick!
Vick! Vick! Vick!

01:03:06.504 --> 01:03:09.807
If you get on this tramp,
you will have a cardiovasectomy.

01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:12.143
I will have
a cardiovasectomy.

01:03:12.176 --> 01:03:14.245
Come on, Vick!
Come on! Come on, Vick!

01:03:14.278 --> 01:03:17.014
- [Wei Wei] You can do it!
- [Joanna] Guys. Peer pressure.

01:03:17.048 --> 01:03:19.584
- [shouting] Ah!
- Think about your weenus.

01:03:19.617 --> 01:03:22.520
[cheering]

01:03:22.554 --> 01:03:24.956
- Come on, Vick!
- Go, Vick!

01:03:24.989 --> 01:03:27.224
Vick! Vick!
Vick! Vick!

01:03:32.697 --> 01:03:36.133
- Layout!
- Layout! Layout!

01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:39.303
- [girl] Come on, Vick!
- Layout! Layout! Layout!

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:44.008
- [cheering]
- OK, you can come down now.

01:03:45.176 --> 01:03:47.612
How 'bout a full?

01:03:47.645 --> 01:03:49.481
- What?
- [girl] Yeah, boy!

01:03:49.514 --> 01:03:52.316
- Yeah!
- [screaming]

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.118
- [girl] Oh, no!
- [Dorrie] Oh, my God.

01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:56.187
I told you so.

01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.826
[groaning] Call 911. Ohh!

01:04:06.063 --> 01:04:08.666
- Bye, Vick.
- He can't hear you.

01:04:12.504 --> 01:04:15.239
- What's up?
- Hiya.

01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:17.341
Hey, ladies!
How ya doin'?

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.743
[all] Hi.

01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:21.012
I'm Poot, and this is
my hetero life-mate, Frank.

01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:23.180
And we're here to be
your hosts for this evening

01:04:23.214 --> 01:04:25.483
- 'cause we're goin' out! Ow!
- [cheering]

01:04:25.517 --> 01:04:29.153
No, we aren't. We have
workouts to finish.

01:04:29.186 --> 01:04:31.389
Who died and
made you Nadia?

01:04:31.423 --> 01:04:33.024
[Wei Wei]
You know you wanna go.

01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:36.027
We can't just leave.
Championships are
three weeks away.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:37.862
Our routines
need to be perfect.

01:04:37.895 --> 01:04:41.332
Put some clothes on
and get in the truck.
We're goin' out.

01:04:41.365 --> 01:04:42.400
[shouting]

01:04:42.434 --> 01:04:44.201
- Come on!
- Yeah!

01:04:44.235 --> 01:04:45.503
Come on.

01:04:45.537 --> 01:04:46.638
[girls squealing]

01:04:48.072 --> 01:04:49.340
Can you speak?

01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:52.810
[Frank] Can you do anything
besides gymnastics?

01:04:54.078 --> 01:04:55.580
[laughing]

01:04:55.613 --> 01:04:59.250
OK. Anything to
get out of this 'tard.

01:04:59.283 --> 01:05:02.019
That's "leotard"
without the "leo."

01:05:02.053 --> 01:05:03.655
In case
you were wondering.

01:05:07.124 --> 01:05:08.926
Dude, she's hot.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.295
What? You don't think
she's hot? I think she's hot.

01:05:11.328 --> 01:05:13.064
Dude, she has
an apple butt.

01:05:13.097 --> 01:05:15.467
- A what?
- An apple butt.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.802
[* Fannypack: Nu Nu

01:05:17.835 --> 01:05:20.371
Whoops. [giggling]

01:05:20.404 --> 01:05:22.139
OK, now my turn.

01:05:22.173 --> 01:05:25.209
So is Frank your, like,
boyfriend or something?

01:05:25.242 --> 01:05:27.144
Like, no.

01:05:27.178 --> 01:05:29.581
- Is Poot?
- No.

01:05:29.614 --> 01:05:32.049
- Why not?
- Ew!

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.918
So they're, like, fair game?

01:05:33.951 --> 01:05:35.720
- Ye...
- Hey, stupid.

01:05:35.753 --> 01:05:37.989
I prefer the term
"meat," please.

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:39.791
[chuckling]
That was spastic.

01:05:39.824 --> 01:05:41.425
Thank you.

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:43.761
May I accompany you
to the jellybeans?

01:05:44.195 --> 01:05:45.663
You may.

01:05:45.697 --> 01:05:47.398
After you, milady.

01:05:47.431 --> 01:05:49.166
Yes!

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:29.373
We're out of the starlet blue.
We're out, we're out, we're out.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:32.376
- Excuse me. I'll take this one.
- OK.

01:06:32.409 --> 01:06:36.180
- And I'm so sorry about them.
- Why? It's hilarious.

01:06:37.081 --> 01:06:38.215
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:38.249 --> 01:06:40.451
We also have that style
with spaghetti straps.

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:43.988
Huh. So, uh, why
are you buying a dress?

01:06:44.021 --> 01:06:45.990
Because you're
taking me to your prom.

01:06:46.023 --> 01:06:48.793
Well, shouldn't you
be buying a tux? Just kidding.

01:06:48.826 --> 01:06:50.394
We can both
wear dresses.

01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:53.497
Don't worry.
I'll totally shave.

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:55.800
OK.

01:06:55.833 --> 01:06:59.637
[Frank] I have a gut feelin'
somethin' bad's gonna happen.

01:06:59.671 --> 01:07:01.706
- [Poot] Oh, dude!
- [all laughing, groaning]

01:07:01.739 --> 01:07:04.909

- Bye-ya.
- Later.

- Call you guys later.
- Sweet.

01:07:11.515 --> 01:07:12.884
Maybe. Maybe not.
Depends.

- Poot?
- Yes.

01:07:14.185 --> 01:07:16.353
- We have a lot to review.
- We do?

01:07:16.387 --> 01:07:17.555
Bye, geeks, I'm out.

01:07:17.589 --> 01:07:19.090
- Later.
- See ya.

01:07:19.891 --> 01:07:21.158
When is your prom?

01:07:21.192 --> 01:07:24.095
I need time, dates,
transportation.

01:07:24.128 --> 01:07:26.030
And you better be
getting me a corsage.

01:07:26.063 --> 01:07:28.032
Are you kidding me?
She's a bitch.

01:07:28.065 --> 01:07:29.533
- Dude.
- What?

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:32.036
You heard me, Miss Bossy Booty.
I don't like how you act.

01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:33.638
Dude, I totally
hate you right now.

01:07:35.539 --> 01:07:38.175
Uh, see, what Frank is
really tryin' to say is,

01:07:38.209 --> 01:07:40.878
um, it would
be my honor.

01:07:40.912 --> 01:07:42.446
You think I'm a bitch?

01:07:44.882 --> 01:07:47.118
No.

01:07:47.151 --> 01:07:48.753
Yeah, kinda, I do.

01:07:48.786 --> 01:07:51.689
But I don't have the problem
with it that Frank does.

01:07:51.723 --> 01:07:53.625
I mean, he's gay.

01:07:57.394 --> 01:08:00.231
- Call me.
- Stalk you.

01:08:03.835 --> 01:08:05.903
Dude, I don't even
know you anymore.

01:08:06.804 --> 01:08:08.072
What's a corsage?

01:08:08.105 --> 01:08:10.808
The universal sign for...
[whipping sound] ...whipped.

01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:12.977
Dude, what's so wrong
about bein' whipped?

01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:15.479
When is that
a bad thing? Ever?

01:08:15.512 --> 01:08:17.915
Huh. Good point.

Stop dancing.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:35.099
Stop it!

01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:38.469
We did not move here from
Wichita so you could go to prom.

01:08:38.502 --> 01:08:40.136
I just wanna go to one prom.

01:08:40.171 --> 01:08:42.640
They don't give out
tiaras at Championships.

01:08:42.674 --> 01:08:47.011
We moved here so you
could go to the Olympics.

01:08:47.044 --> 01:08:48.845
- Phyllis.
- Mom.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:51.182
The Olympics
are ages away.

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:52.950
Prom is, like,
any minute.

01:08:52.984 --> 01:08:54.652
- OK.
- Phyllis.

01:08:54.685 --> 01:08:56.988
You are a 24-hour gymnast.

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:58.823
Not part-time.
Full-time.

01:08:58.856 --> 01:08:59.991
I know.

01:09:00.024 --> 01:09:01.492
- Phyllis.
- [Phyllis] And...

01:09:01.524 --> 01:09:04.962
...we have an agreement
that you agreed to honor.

01:09:04.996 --> 01:09:08.966
You are not going to the prom.
End of discussion.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.334
- OK.
- [Vick] May I?

01:09:11.635 --> 01:09:15.206
Phyllis, now Joanne
is a lovely gymnast.

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:17.709
I think we oughta get real
about her chances

01:09:17.742 --> 01:09:19.176
of making the Olympic team.

01:09:22.145 --> 01:09:27.984
The only reason we're here
is because we agreed

01:09:28.019 --> 01:09:31.689
that she'd be going
to the Olympics.

01:09:31.723 --> 01:09:35.192
I know. I know.

01:09:35.225 --> 01:09:36.861
[Vick] I, uh...

01:09:39.863 --> 01:09:42.533
I guess I lied. Hmm?

01:09:46.337 --> 01:09:48.005
Look, everyone...

01:09:48.038 --> 01:09:51.242
Everyone wants to hear
that their kid is special.

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.243
And they are.

01:09:53.277 --> 01:09:56.881
And maybe they're
going to the Olympics.

01:09:56.914 --> 01:09:58.649
- "Maybe."
- Yes. Maybe they will.

01:09:58.682 --> 01:10:01.318
[Phyllis] We don't
pay for "maybe."

01:10:01.352 --> 01:10:04.989
People told me I was nuts
to bring Joanne here.

01:10:05.022 --> 01:10:07.992
And they were right.

01:10:08.025 --> 01:10:12.329
I'm just glad that I'm getting
her out of here in one piece.

01:10:12.363 --> 01:10:15.699
A coach who's
a has-been

01:10:15.733 --> 01:10:19.036
doesn't coach champions.

01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:21.806
He just makes
more has-beens.

01:10:22.473 --> 01:10:23.574
Goodbye, Burt.

01:10:25.142 --> 01:10:27.644
You will miss me.

01:10:29.213 --> 01:10:31.582
Championships
are three weeks away.

01:10:31.615 --> 01:10:34.085
- Where we gonna go?
- I'll coach you myself.

01:10:35.086 --> 01:10:36.921
I thought you
wanted her to win.

01:10:38.089 --> 01:10:40.657
And what would you know
about winning?

01:10:43.060 --> 01:10:46.798
Joanne. You're more
than welcome to stay.

01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:48.465
[sighing]

01:10:48.499 --> 01:10:50.501
Josie, let's go.

01:10:58.009 --> 01:11:02.413
I think I'm gonna
go to prom first.

01:11:04.281 --> 01:11:05.850
[rock music]

01:11:10.822 --> 01:11:12.857
[woman directing gymnasts]

01:11:18.996 --> 01:11:21.432
Are you OK?

01:11:21.465 --> 01:11:25.102
Oh, it's just... I haven't
had four girls qualify

01:11:25.136 --> 01:11:27.338
for Championships
in a long time.

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:29.606
Define "long."

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.478
[sighing] Actually, I haven't
had four girls qualify...

01:11:34.511 --> 01:11:36.513
...ever.

01:11:38.182 --> 01:11:39.817
Are you gonna cry?

01:11:39.851 --> 01:11:42.519
No, I'm not gonna cry.

01:11:42.553 --> 01:11:43.855
It's just...

01:11:43.888 --> 01:11:47.091
[stuttering] It's a nice thing.
It's beautiful.

01:11:47.124 --> 01:11:50.627
- Jesus, Hay.
- What? You can cry.

01:11:50.661 --> 01:11:52.529
Doesn't make you
any less of a man, Vicki.

01:11:52.563 --> 01:11:54.598
Come on,
I won't tell the parents.

01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:56.633
[techno music]

01:12:01.005 --> 01:12:04.976
[man] Welcome to
the Neutrogena National
Gymnastics Championships.

01:12:05.009 --> 01:12:07.144
Hello, everybody.
I'm Tim Dagget,

01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:09.180
joined along
with Elfi Schlegel.

01:12:09.213 --> 01:12:12.716
It is two days of gymnastics
competition on tap.

01:12:12.749 --> 01:12:14.485
Today, the all-around finals.

01:12:14.518 --> 01:12:17.654
Day two, the
individual event finals.

01:12:17.688 --> 01:12:20.224
Think of the difference
as a jack-of-all-trades

01:12:20.257 --> 01:12:23.027
versus an individual-event
specialist.

01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.996
She should do her routine,
then warm up.

01:12:25.029 --> 01:12:27.231
- They're already stretched.
- They need to warm up.

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:28.900
- No.
- They've been stretching.

01:12:28.933 --> 01:12:31.502
[sighing] Oh, crap.

01:12:31.535 --> 01:12:35.639
Hm, Vickerman. Must be
some crutches around somewhere.

01:12:35.672 --> 01:12:37.641
Tonight, the
all-around competition,

01:12:37.674 --> 01:12:40.844
where the top six qualify
for a berth on the World Team.

01:12:40.878 --> 01:12:43.014
The longtime favorite,
Tricia Skilken,

01:12:43.047 --> 01:12:45.716
is hoping to make her
fifth and final World Team

01:12:45.749 --> 01:12:47.885
before her retirement.

01:12:47.919 --> 01:12:50.587
While gymnastics wild child,
Haley Graham, has come out

01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:53.357
of retirement to try to
make it for the second time.

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:56.527
Will her pyrotechnics
rise to the occasion?

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:58.662
Or will she simply flame out?

01:12:58.695 --> 01:13:00.764
Few can forget
Haley Graham's walkout

01:13:00.797 --> 01:13:03.200
of the World Championships
two years ago.

01:13:03.234 --> 01:13:05.336
Haley was last to go
on the floor exercise

01:13:05.369 --> 01:13:08.405
when she shocked fans and
teammates by exiting the arena

01:13:08.439 --> 01:13:11.442
and walking into an
automatic disqualification.

01:13:11.475 --> 01:13:13.510
That stroll knocked Team USA

01:13:13.544 --> 01:13:15.079
completely out
of medal position.

01:13:15.112 --> 01:13:17.014
If ever there was
a score to settle,

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:19.283
it's between Tricia Skilken
and Haley Graham.

01:13:19.316 --> 01:13:20.985
Tricia.

01:13:22.819 --> 01:13:24.956
I didn't mean
to wreck your Worlds.

01:13:24.989 --> 01:13:27.124
Mine was disintegrating and...

01:13:27.158 --> 01:13:29.927
I wrote you a note, apologizing.

01:13:29.961 --> 01:13:32.663
I don't know
if you got it or not.

01:13:34.831 --> 01:13:38.069
[Tim] We have a tremendous
amount of talented athletes
out on the floor.

01:13:38.102 --> 01:13:41.138
One of them, Haley Graham,
brings a lot of potential

01:13:41.172 --> 01:13:43.807
to this US team. She could
medal internationally

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.277
on virtually all
of the apparatus.

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:48.745
Super power, huge difficulty,

01:13:48.779 --> 01:13:51.282
but she is not known
for her consistency.

01:13:51.315 --> 01:13:54.451
And, Elfi, when ya get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

01:13:54.485 --> 01:13:57.288
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

01:13:57.321 --> 01:13:59.991
[Elfi] And, Tim, we have
to remember that for Haley,

01:14:00.024 --> 01:14:02.793
it's her record
and her reputation that will

01:14:02.826 --> 01:14:05.229
really be the only thing
stopping them

01:14:05.262 --> 01:14:08.265
from handing her that valuable
one-way ticket to Rome

01:14:08.299 --> 01:14:11.002
and the World Championships,
later on this year.

01:14:14.805 --> 01:14:16.807
[Haley] It's the
same old Championships,

01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:19.110
but I am a totally
different person.

01:14:21.712 --> 01:14:24.315
And even though I'm pretty
sure that I'll be judged

01:14:24.348 --> 01:14:26.450
for who I was
and not who I am,

01:14:26.483 --> 01:14:27.851
I know I have to face this.

01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:36.127
Four events and
four judges per event.

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.663
That's 16 judges ready to
tell us just how badly we suck.

01:14:39.696 --> 01:14:43.700
Sixteen people ready to tell us
just how perfect we're not.

01:14:43.734 --> 01:14:47.504
But here we are...
chasing perfection.

01:14:49.306 --> 01:14:52.209
The problem is,
perfection doesn't exist.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:56.313
But just try telling that
to the judges.

01:14:56.347 --> 01:14:59.016
[audience claps and cheers]

01:15:04.488 --> 01:15:05.956
Where'd ya find
those deductions?

01:15:05.989 --> 01:15:08.025
- The floor? Trash?
- 'Scuse me? Can you move?

01:15:08.059 --> 01:15:10.661
Oh, very clever.
No, no, we decided
her start value is

01:15:10.694 --> 01:15:12.163
a nine-point-eight,
not a ten.

01:15:12.196 --> 01:15:14.031
You know the strength
required for that?

01:15:14.065 --> 01:15:15.966
You realize what you're
doin' to this girl?

01:15:15.999 --> 01:15:18.302
- I'm aware, thank you.
- This about her routine?

01:15:18.335 --> 01:15:20.304
Look, we don't want
to encourage the girls

01:15:20.337 --> 01:15:22.906
to attempt such a dangerous
skill and risk injury.

01:15:22.939 --> 01:15:25.642
Surely, you know,
with your track record,

01:15:25.676 --> 01:15:28.679
you could understand that.
I mean, probably, anyway.

01:15:28.712 --> 01:15:31.348
- Oh, I understand. Believe me.
- Could you move, please?

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:36.853
[Haley] It doesn't
matter how hard we run
or how high we flip.

01:15:36.887 --> 01:15:38.989
Leave your hands
on the vault table too long,

01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:40.324
deduction.

01:15:40.357 --> 01:15:43.026
If you use one arm instead
of two, big deduction.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.595
And if your feet
clip the vault

01:15:44.628 --> 01:15:47.831
before they hit the floor...
you're done.

01:15:47.864 --> 01:15:50.334
So you say you want lyrics
in your floor music?

01:15:50.367 --> 01:15:52.603
[chuckling] Huge deduction.

01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:54.238
Music finishes,
but you don't?

01:15:54.271 --> 01:15:55.606
Two-tenths deduction.

01:15:57.808 --> 01:15:59.776
It doesn't matter
how well you do.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.079
It's how well
you follow their rules.

01:16:02.113 --> 01:16:05.116
And that just blows.

01:16:05.149 --> 01:16:07.118
[Tim] It's a
little bit crazy, Elfi,

01:16:07.151 --> 01:16:11.122
that Nastia Liukin threw
a quad twist on floor exercise

01:16:11.155 --> 01:16:13.357
and got a deduction
on a silly technicality.

01:16:13.390 --> 01:16:14.725
I can't believe it.

01:16:14.758 --> 01:16:18.129
It's a commentary on judging
and how it's gotta change.

01:16:18.162 --> 01:16:21.265
[Elfi] Haley Graham gave the
performance of her life tonight.

01:16:21.298 --> 01:16:24.435
No way she should've ended up
seventh in the standing.

01:16:24.468 --> 01:16:26.803
[Tim] She might've been
shut out of the all-around,

01:16:26.837 --> 01:16:29.806
but the judges can't keep her
outta the event finals tomorrow.

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.375
Well, Tricia,
congratulations.

01:16:31.408 --> 01:16:33.977
How does this win compare to
other competitions for you?

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:35.112
It felt so great.

01:16:35.146 --> 01:16:37.148
I just wanted to go in
and hit four for four

01:16:37.181 --> 01:16:39.216
and qualify for Worlds
one last time.

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.418
And, um, winning was
just icing on the cake.

01:16:41.452 --> 01:16:43.086
What about
Haley Graham out there?

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.257
Given your history, how did
it feel competing with her?

01:16:46.290 --> 01:16:48.459
It was so great
competing with Haley again.

01:16:48.492 --> 01:16:50.761
Um, I wish her
all the very best.

01:16:50.794 --> 01:16:52.796
- OK. Good luck in the future.
- Thank you.

01:16:52.829 --> 01:16:54.731
Your routines
were amazing.

01:16:54.765 --> 01:16:56.800
You'll win floor at
event finals for sure.

01:16:56.833 --> 01:17:00.404
- No. I didn't even qualify.
- That is so lame.

01:17:00.437 --> 01:17:02.473
Boo-hoo.
Stop whining.

01:17:02.506 --> 01:17:05.409
- Diva.
- Dee-vil.

01:17:05.442 --> 01:17:06.777
[sighing]

01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:08.212
[* Jeannie Ortega: Crowded]

01:17:12.349 --> 01:17:14.818
I think you are
a very good coach.

01:17:14.851 --> 01:17:17.154
- Really?
- I do.

01:17:17.188 --> 01:17:19.290
There's a little action
in the back section?

01:17:19.323 --> 01:17:21.292
- That's not too bad.
- Not... not good.

01:17:21.325 --> 01:17:23.760
I wouldn't, ya know...
Oh, yikes. Those two.

01:17:23.794 --> 01:17:26.029
I worked with her
last year. Nightmare.

01:17:26.062 --> 01:17:27.464
- [exhaling]
- On Elm Street.

01:17:27.498 --> 01:17:29.466
- Have you seen her face?
- [chuckling]

01:17:31.868 --> 01:17:33.937
- Hey. Scotch. Neat, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:36.207
Hey, Burt, how ya doin'?
Good job today.

01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:39.476
That Haley is a handful,
isn't she? [laughs]

01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:41.345
What do ya mean?

01:17:41.378 --> 01:17:43.814
Oh, come on, Burt,
I built that kid.

01:17:43.847 --> 01:17:45.816
I mean, you can
glom on for the ride,

01:17:45.849 --> 01:17:47.351
but everyone knows
who built her.

01:17:47.384 --> 01:17:48.652
Make no mistake, buddy.

01:17:48.685 --> 01:17:50.654
Yeah, that "kid"...

01:17:50.687 --> 01:17:54.090
That kid is here
in spite of you, Chris.

01:17:54.691 --> 01:17:56.327
You're kidding.

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:57.661
[laughs] You know,

01:17:57.694 --> 01:17:59.730
if I didn't have
four girls competing tomorrow,

01:17:59.763 --> 01:18:01.565
I'd kick your ass
just for thinking

01:18:01.598 --> 01:18:02.966
you had anything
to do with her.

01:18:02.999 --> 01:18:04.501
She might not
have medaled,

01:18:04.535 --> 01:18:06.403
but at least she can
still walk, right?

01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:11.275
Good job, Burt.

01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:20.217
Unbelievable.

01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:22.286
[rock music]

01:18:23.854 --> 01:18:26.223
[Haley] Every girl here
wants the same thing:

01:18:26.257 --> 01:18:29.226
To justify this
crazy thing we do

01:18:29.260 --> 01:18:31.395
and stand on that podium
and be the best.

01:18:31.428 --> 01:18:34.465
And we want it so bad we will
fight each other for it.

01:18:36.199 --> 01:18:38.068
But who are we really
competing against?

01:18:38.101 --> 01:18:40.170
I mean, we all wanna win,

01:18:40.203 --> 01:18:42.239
but should we be
fighting each other...

01:18:45.075 --> 01:18:46.743
...or the officials?

01:18:46.777 --> 01:18:50.113
You know, maybe they
judge us so harshly
because of one thing:

01:18:50.146 --> 01:18:53.784
They really wanna be like us.
I mean, everyone knows...

01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:55.886
...they're just jealous.

01:19:01.057 --> 01:19:02.426
Phyllis?

01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:04.595
Alice!
How are you?

01:19:04.628 --> 01:19:06.096
Oh!

01:19:06.129 --> 01:19:07.564
Did you have
work done?

01:19:07.598 --> 01:19:09.633
You look great.
I'll see ya later.

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:11.302
- Thanks!
- We'll talk later?

01:19:11.335 --> 01:19:12.769
That's not an answer.

01:19:12.803 --> 01:19:15.205
First up on vault
is Mina Hoyt.

01:19:15.238 --> 01:19:16.573
And, Elfi,
she is vaulting

01:19:16.607 --> 01:19:18.809
a handspring
double front somersault.

01:19:18.842 --> 01:19:21.478
Has a start value
out of a 10.0.

01:19:21.512 --> 01:19:23.780
Very few gymnasts
perform this vault

01:19:23.814 --> 01:19:26.283
because it is so
incredibly difficult.

01:19:26.317 --> 01:19:29.085
I haven't seen one done
since Produnova of Russia

01:19:29.119 --> 01:19:31.588
dominated with it
nearly a decade ago.

01:19:31.622 --> 01:19:34.458
Her body will flip over
three times in the air

01:19:34.491 --> 01:19:36.460
and somehow
find the floor.

01:19:36.493 --> 01:19:38.795
[Elfi] And, Tim, I just
saw her do it moments ago

01:19:38.829 --> 01:19:41.798
in the warm-up.
It is unbelievable.

01:19:41.832 --> 01:19:43.767
[Haley] Come on, Mina.
Let's go.

01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:46.337
- [heartbeat]
- [Joanne] Let's go, Mina.

01:20:02.319 --> 01:20:04.321
[cheering, screaming]

01:20:05.155 --> 01:20:06.690
Go, Mina!

01:20:06.723 --> 01:20:09.326
[Tim] That was incredible.

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.329
The height, the distance.
Bam! The stuck landing.

01:20:12.363 --> 01:20:15.599
If they don't give her a ten
on this, there is no justice.

01:20:15.632 --> 01:20:17.267
Come on, judges,
give her a ten.

01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:18.802
[Elfi] How can they not?

01:20:18.835 --> 01:20:20.837
[audience booing]

01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:22.639
What?

01:20:22.673 --> 01:20:25.141
[Tim] Elfi. Whoa,
I can't believe it.

01:20:25.175 --> 01:20:28.044
A nine-five?
This is an outrage.

01:20:28.078 --> 01:20:30.681
- [Elfi] Tim, I'm shocked.
- [whispering] Oh, crap.

01:20:31.715 --> 01:20:33.950
You're not supposed
to be up here, Burt.

01:20:33.984 --> 01:20:36.520
Where is this deduction
coming from? Hmm?

01:20:37.988 --> 01:20:41.191
[scoffing] Her bra strap
was showing, Burt.

01:20:41.224 --> 01:20:43.193
It's an
automatic deduction...

01:20:43.226 --> 01:20:45.328
- Come on!
- ...if an
undergarment's showing.

01:20:45.362 --> 01:20:46.530
That rule...

01:20:46.563 --> 01:20:49.733
Doris, she's
flipping through the air.

01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:52.803
She's spinning, Doris.
Of course her bra popped out.

01:20:52.836 --> 01:20:54.805
That rule is ancient.

01:20:54.838 --> 01:20:57.441
Apparently, so is her bra.

01:21:00.877 --> 01:21:02.312
[clears throat]

01:21:02.345 --> 01:21:04.381
Don't make me
red card you, Burt.

01:21:04.415 --> 01:21:06.583
I really don't
wanna red card you, OK?

01:21:06.617 --> 01:21:11.121
Vick. [whispering]
Vick, don't. Come on.

01:21:12.355 --> 01:21:14.224
Even I think that's low.

01:21:14.257 --> 01:21:17.193
And I should be happy.
I mean, I wanna win.

01:21:18.529 --> 01:21:20.964
Your bra was sticking out.

01:21:22.365 --> 01:21:25.201
[shouting] One-tenth off because
her bra was sticking out.

01:21:25.235 --> 01:21:27.070
[audience booing]

01:21:27.103 --> 01:21:28.572
I've never even heard of that.

01:21:28.605 --> 01:21:30.574
They didn't deduct her
because of her bra.

01:21:30.607 --> 01:21:33.376
They deducted her
because I'm her coach.

01:21:34.745 --> 01:21:36.713
Come on, Haley.
You're up.

01:21:36.747 --> 01:21:38.882
[Tim] This is where
the sport loses fans.

01:21:38.915 --> 01:21:41.552
The system, the judging,
it's too confusing.

01:21:41.585 --> 01:21:44.220
The crowd just saw
a spectacular skill.

01:21:44.254 --> 01:21:48.258
They don't understand why a
gymnast is not rewarded for it.

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.494
- That's wrong.
- [Mina] Come on. You got it.

01:21:51.628 --> 01:21:53.630
[audience cheering, applauding]

01:21:58.469 --> 01:22:00.003
Come on, Haley.

01:22:12.148 --> 01:22:14.017

[audience cheering]

01:22:42.946 --> 01:22:44.247
Did she just scratch?

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.616
[Elfi] An intentional scratch

01:22:45.649 --> 01:22:48.652
from Haley Graham
in event finals.

01:22:48.685 --> 01:22:50.821
This has never happened before.

01:22:54.558 --> 01:22:56.126
Way to stick it.

01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:59.630
Next time you should
stick out your tongue too.

01:22:59.663 --> 01:23:03.333
I would, but my coach likes it
when I control my tricks.

01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:05.401
[chuckles]

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.542
That was for you.

01:23:12.643 --> 01:23:14.745
Come on, Joanne.
Let's get out there.

01:23:16.913 --> 01:23:20.851
- [Mina] Come on. You got it.
- Joanne!

01:23:41.271 --> 01:23:44.174
[Tim] She is walking
down the runway?

01:23:44.207 --> 01:23:46.843
There is something really weird
going on here today, Elfi.

01:23:46.877 --> 01:23:48.579
[Elfi] You can say
that again, Tim.

01:23:48.612 --> 01:23:51.615
[Tim] There is something really
weird going on here today, Elfi.

01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.156
[Tim] Elfi, I have
never seen this before.

01:24:00.190 --> 01:24:03.426
Back-to-back athletes
scratching intentionally.

01:24:21.912 --> 01:24:23.313
Beautiful!

01:24:24.648 --> 01:24:26.750
I couldn't let you have
all the attention.

01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.630
[Tim] 'Cause of the scratching,
looks like Mina Hoyt

01:24:39.663 --> 01:24:42.265
is going to be the
new national vault champion.

01:24:42.298 --> 01:24:44.334
[Elfi] This is unprecedented.

01:24:45.468 --> 01:24:46.770
My God, I'm the
new vault champ.

01:24:46.803 --> 01:24:47.971
- I know!
- Woo!

01:24:48.004 --> 01:24:49.640
And I loved not going.

01:24:49.673 --> 01:24:53.576
I mean, if we chose
the winner on every event,

01:24:53.610 --> 01:24:57.247
we could actually control
the results for a change.

01:24:58.915 --> 01:25:00.917
Oh, my God,
you're right.

01:25:02.819 --> 01:25:04.788
Since when
are you brilliant?

01:25:04.821 --> 01:25:07.457
I don't know.
Since now.

01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:11.962
You guys, we are going to
scratch and let Nastia...

01:25:11.995 --> 01:25:13.997
- Yeah. Absolutely.
- She's the best.

- [audience] Woo!

01:25:28.812 --> 01:25:31.214
Whoo! Good job, Gloria!

01:25:46.162 --> 01:25:48.799
[Tim] The judges are
trying to figure out

01:25:48.832 --> 01:25:52.002
what is gonna happen.
I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

01:25:52.035 --> 01:25:54.304
- Come on, Nastia!
- [Elfi] She's goin' for it.

01:25:54.337 --> 01:25:56.306
[Tim] Well, Elfi,
we've seen five athletes,

01:25:56.339 --> 01:25:58.374
and no one's done that,
right there, an element.

01:25:58.408 --> 01:26:00.811
So that means that she is
going to be the uneven bar

01:26:00.844 --> 01:26:03.980
champion just by
that skill alone.

01:26:07.684 --> 01:26:10.053
[audience cheers]

01:26:21.597 --> 01:26:23.133

- Whoo-hoo!

01:26:23.166 --> 01:26:26.336
Way to go, Nastia!
Amazing. She's amazing.

01:26:26.369 --> 01:26:27.904
- I'm so glad we picked her.
- Whoo!

01:26:27.938 --> 01:26:30.240
- I'm so glad we picked her.
- Picked her?

01:26:46.356 --> 01:26:47.657
[audience cheers]

01:26:47.690 --> 01:26:49.659
[Tim] Unreal.
That rocked.

01:26:49.692 --> 01:26:53.696
Nastia Liukin will be
the new uneven bar champion.

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:55.265
Well, the athletes have spoken.

01:26:55.298 --> 01:26:59.435
And there will be no silver,
no bronze medals on bars today.

01:26:59.469 --> 01:27:01.271
Thanks.

01:27:01.304 --> 01:27:03.173
It was everybody.

01:27:03.206 --> 01:27:04.607
[Tim] After what happened to

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.110
Nastia Liukin and
Wei Wei Yong yesterday

01:27:07.143 --> 01:27:08.678
and Mina Hoyt today,

01:27:08.711 --> 01:27:10.546
I think it's safe to say
the athletes are

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:11.948
sending the judges a message.

01:27:11.982 --> 01:27:13.449
[Elfi] This is historic, Tim.

01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:17.020
I've never seen this kind of
organized rebellion before.

01:27:17.053 --> 01:27:20.757
Are you going to tell me who is
going to compete and who isn't?

01:27:22.658 --> 01:27:24.995
You're not going
to tell me, are you?

01:27:27.964 --> 01:27:29.232
Oops.

01:27:31.134 --> 01:27:34.270
'Cause there are alternates
who would like to compete.

So selfish.

01:28:03.099 --> 01:28:05.068
I can scratch, and we can
still make our point.

01:28:05.101 --> 01:28:07.470
No, no, no, we picked you.
We wanna see your routine.

01:28:07.503 --> 01:28:09.339
It's your call.

01:28:11.808 --> 01:28:14.845
OK. Cool.

01:28:16.012 --> 01:28:18.148
[Tim] We have seen
scratch after scratch.

01:28:18.181 --> 01:28:20.650
The meet director,
prior to this event,

01:28:20.683 --> 01:28:23.987
he decided to put in the
alternate, Tricia Skilken,

01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.756
because he thought for sure
he'd get a routine out of her.

01:28:26.789 --> 01:28:27.958
We'll see.

01:28:27.991 --> 01:28:31.127
Here comes her big
acrobatic moment right here.

01:28:31.161 --> 01:28:32.362
Connected together.

01:28:32.395 --> 01:28:35.631
Two aerial skills,
very nicely done.

01:28:35.665 --> 01:28:38.801
Is this how you feel
when you watch my routine?

01:28:38.835 --> 01:28:40.736
Uh, yeah.

01:28:41.504 --> 01:28:44.340
I am so sorry.

01:28:44.374 --> 01:28:47.978
[Elfi] She's looking
really secure in this routine.

01:28:48.011 --> 01:28:50.380
Vary exact in all her movements.

01:28:50.413 --> 01:28:52.548
Now, she does do
a very interesting skill

01:28:52.582 --> 01:28:53.816
that's coming up here.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:55.518
[Tim] Two in a row.
Very nicely done.

01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:57.020
Illusions, they're called.

01:28:57.053 --> 01:29:00.156

Just kidding.

are trying to figure out

I'm not so sure either, Elfi.

01:29:35.191 --> 01:29:36.659

we got another routine.

01:30:18.568 --> 01:30:20.903
Whoa!

01:30:52.868 --> 01:30:55.171
[audience cheering]

01:31:05.115 --> 01:31:07.517
- [screaming]
- [cheering]

01:31:10.220 --> 01:31:12.855
[Tim] Well, it's very original,
but I'm afraid the judges

01:31:12.888 --> 01:31:15.491
probably won't know what
to do with that routine, Elfi.

01:31:15.525 --> 01:31:18.261
[Elfi] With those scores,
Tricia will get the gold,

01:31:18.294 --> 01:31:20.830
and Wei Wei will
take home a silver.

01:31:22.532 --> 01:31:25.135
So it is old school
versus new school.

01:31:25.168 --> 01:31:28.638
Tricia Skilken,
a longtime judges' favorite.

01:31:28.671 --> 01:31:30.806
- Very consistent.
- Lookin' good.

01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:34.310
[Tim] In contrast, Haley,
raw power, huge start values,

01:31:34.344 --> 01:31:36.946
but she is not known
for her consistency.

01:31:36.979 --> 01:31:39.649
And, Elfi, when ya get right
down to it, in gymnastics,

01:31:39.682 --> 01:31:42.618
consistency over flash
is what rules the day.

01:31:42.652 --> 01:31:46.189
Go ahead, scratch.
You're all zeroes anyway.

01:31:49.192 --> 01:31:51.827
Tricia, this is
not about winning.

01:31:51.861 --> 01:31:53.963
I'm not here
to screw you over.

01:31:53.996 --> 01:31:56.466
Oh. Too late.

01:31:56.499 --> 01:31:59.202
Fine. Then I'll scratch
if you want the moment.

01:31:59.235 --> 01:32:00.736
But this?

01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:03.039
This is much bigger
than you and me.

01:32:05.108 --> 01:32:07.977
[Tim] Well, like we said, they
were warming up their tumbling,

01:32:08.010 --> 01:32:11.481
but we've seen four athletes
scratch so who knows what

01:32:11.514 --> 01:32:13.083
Haley's gonna decide to do?

01:32:13.116 --> 01:32:15.985
If she's gonna do
the whole thing,
if she's gonna do nothin'.

01:32:16.018 --> 01:32:17.987
- Come on!
- [Tim] I don't have a clue.

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:21.491
- [Joanne] You got it!
- [girl] Go, Haley!

01:32:21.524 --> 01:32:24.160
[Haley] There are things you
wish for before big moments.

01:32:24.194 --> 01:32:26.396
I wish my friends were here.

01:32:26.429 --> 01:32:30.333
[sighing] God. I wish
my parents were different.

01:32:30.366 --> 01:32:34.204
I wish there was someone
who got what was happening,

01:32:34.237 --> 01:32:37.840
and could just look at me
and tell me we weren't crazy.

01:32:37.873 --> 01:32:40.042
That we weren't being stupid.

01:32:40.076 --> 01:32:41.777
Someone to say,

01:32:41.811 --> 01:32:44.847
"I'm proud of you.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:48.084
And I got your back.
No matter what."

01:32:48.118 --> 01:32:49.752
Haley, Haley.

01:32:51.621 --> 01:32:52.788
What's wrong?

01:32:52.822 --> 01:32:55.891
Nothing. Listen...

01:32:55.925 --> 01:33:00.330
I, uh... I just
want you to know...

01:33:00.796 --> 01:33:02.532
What?

01:33:02.565 --> 01:33:04.900
That, uh...

01:33:04.934 --> 01:33:06.469
[exhaling]

01:33:06.502 --> 01:33:09.071
- I'm so...
- Don't.

01:33:09.105 --> 01:33:13.343
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm so...

01:33:14.477 --> 01:33:17.447
...proud to be your coach.

01:33:25.788 --> 01:33:28.324
Now, don't you dare hold back.

01:33:28.358 --> 01:33:31.261
And floor it. Mm-hm?

01:33:32.662 --> 01:33:35.097
Let's go, Haley!
Come on!

01:33:35.131 --> 01:33:37.167
[audience cheering]

01:33:38.168 --> 01:33:40.803
[Joanne] Come on, Haley.
Let it rip!

- You can do it!
Come on, Haley!

Let's see it!

[all cheering]

01:35:09.759 --> 01:35:11.527
Yeah, Haley!

01:35:13.062 --> 01:35:15.998
[girl] Yeah, Haley!

[crowd booing]

01:35:41.891 --> 01:35:43.593
Selfish.

[audience cheering, clapping]

01:36:17.860 --> 01:36:19.462

[whistling]

01:36:27.102 --> 01:36:29.171
Whoo!

01:36:34.444 --> 01:36:37.413
[Haley] As we got our totally
fake first-place medals,

01:36:37.447 --> 01:36:41.651
I realized gymnastics wasn't
there to judge me or dis me.

01:36:41.684 --> 01:36:43.519
Only I could do that.

01:36:43.553 --> 01:36:46.188
I couldn't look back and
think it was about the judges

01:36:46.221 --> 01:36:47.857
or the parents
or the coaches at all.

01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:50.626
It was about us.
And for us.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.294
Haley!

01:36:52.328 --> 01:36:56.466
And that felt totally
first-place real to me.

01:36:56.499 --> 01:36:58.200
I'm glad it did.
I think it's important

01:36:58.233 --> 01:37:00.169
that we controlled
the results for once.

01:37:00.202 --> 01:37:02.505
- and give the judges...
- [phone ringing]

01:37:02.538 --> 01:37:05.107
Oh, excuse me.

01:37:05.140 --> 01:37:07.276
Hey, what's up?

01:37:07.309 --> 01:37:10.179
Yeah, just one second.
She's right here.

01:37:10.212 --> 01:37:12.448
And, technically, I was
the second to scratch,

01:37:12.482 --> 01:37:13.816
but I got
the ball rolling...

01:37:13.849 --> 01:37:16.151
Oh, I'm sorry.
Just one second.
This is for you.

01:37:16.185 --> 01:37:22.191
Poot? I wanted a pink corsage,
but white will work.

01:37:23.993 --> 01:37:25.861
You'll never guess
what I did today.

01:37:25.895 --> 01:37:28.063
[reporters] Carly!

01:37:28.097 --> 01:37:30.466
One second, guys. Would
y'all sign my program?

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:32.402
- Wha...?!
- Oh, my gosh...

01:37:32.435 --> 01:37:33.636
...yes!

01:37:33.669 --> 01:37:35.170
So amazing.

01:37:35.204 --> 01:37:36.672
Haley. Haley.

01:37:36.706 --> 01:37:38.207
- I need to talk to you.
- OK.

01:37:39.509 --> 01:37:42.011
I got some really
bad news to tell ya.

01:37:42.044 --> 01:37:43.513
What?

01:37:43.546 --> 01:37:46.148
How much do ya hate
college gymnastics? Hmm?

01:37:46.181 --> 01:37:48.851
I decided not to hate things
I've never tried.

01:37:49.685 --> 01:37:51.654
All these schools want me?

01:37:51.687 --> 01:37:54.490
- Well, where should I go?
- Eh, you'll figure it out.

01:37:54.524 --> 01:37:56.492
Maybe I should just
tell 'em to stick it.

01:37:56.526 --> 01:37:58.227
Oh, yeah, like you
know how to stick it.

01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.330
- Uh, my feet were glued.
- Yeah, to a high-speed bus.

01:38:01.363 --> 01:38:03.332
You're the one that
told me to floor it.

01:38:03.365 --> 01:38:06.602
[chuckling] Yeah,
you floored it all right.

01:38:06.636 --> 01:38:10.840
[rock music]

01:38:10.873 --> 01:38:12.307
[Vick] Huh?

01:38:13.308 --> 01:38:15.445
[Vick] You did it, kid.
