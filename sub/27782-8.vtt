00:02.602 --> 00:05.071
{\an8}(Juliette)
We've all made mistakes
this summer.

00:05.138 --> 00:08.375
{\an8}Like Kelsey throwing her new
boyfriend in Garrett's face.

00:08.441 --> 00:10.744
{\an7}My heart belongs to him,
and I love him.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.912
{\an7}And I'm sorry I'm with him,
and he's my boyfriend.

00:12.979 --> 00:16.416
{\an8}(Juliette)
That sent Garrett straight
into the arms of another girl.

00:16.483 --> 00:18.585
{\an8}Are they making out?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.585
{\an8}When aren't they making out?

00:18.651 --> 00:20.153
{\an8}(Juliette)
And he never looked back.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.821
{\an8}(Madisson)
Looking good.

00:21.888 --> 00:23.823
{\an8}(Juliette)
Madisson's mistake was
to trust Ben.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.292
{\an8}Tawni texted me
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:23.890 --> 00:26.292
{\an7}What?

00:26.359 --> 00:30.697
{\an7}(Chloe)
That guy's a total cheater.
"Hey hottie, heart eyes"?

00:30.764 --> 00:32.432
{\an8}(Juliette)
And the second Chloe found out

00:32.499 --> 00:34.934
{\an8}Ben's dirty little secret...

00:32.499 --> 00:34.934
{\an7}What?

00:35.001 --> 00:38.405
{\an8}(Juliette)
She was determined to make sure
everyone on the Key knew, too.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.773
{\an7}(Ben)
Chloe, you're sitting here
trying to entrap me.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.574
{\an8}No, I don't like
being attacked, thank you.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.643
{\an8}Well, I don't like
being spied on.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.779
{\an8}(Juliette)
And as for me,
I keep making

00:45.845 --> 00:47.947
{\an8}the same mistake
over and over again.

00:48.014 --> 00:50.049
{\an8}(Kelsey)
Promise me you're not gonna
go home on the boat with him.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.584
{\an8}You're coming home with us!

00:51.651 --> 00:53.219
{\an8}(Juliette)
I'm really trying to do
the right thing.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.755
{\an8}Yes, Jule! Whoo!

00:55.822 --> 00:59.325
{\an7}I care about you more than
any girl in this world.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.461
(Juliette)
But you know what they say...

01:01.528 --> 01:03.096
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.031

02:00.320 --> 02:01.855
{\an8}Another "A," you know.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.855
{\an8}Okay, perfect.

02:01.921 --> 02:04.224
{\an7}(Chloe)
Do you think Juliette's
gonna come with Alex?

02:04.290 --> 02:06.593
{\an8}(exhales)
I wouldn't doubt it.

02:06.659 --> 02:10.530
{\an7}She loves Alex,
and she wants
to stay with him.

02:10.597 --> 02:13.066
{\an8}So she's just going
to force herself...

02:10.597 --> 02:13.066
{\an9}Yeah.

02:13.132 --> 02:15.735
{\an7}...to believe that Alex
didn't do anything.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.237
{\an8}(Lexie)
How are you and Alex?

02:17.303 --> 02:19.506
{\an7}I just wanna pretend this
whole situation didn't happen.

02:19.572 --> 02:21.241
{\an5}I'm not just--

02:19.572 --> 02:21.241
He sent me those flowers.

02:21.307 --> 02:22.442
{\an3}Seriously?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.442
{\an1}Yeah.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.644
{\an6}Well, okay.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.644
Wanna see what he wrote?

02:24.711 --> 02:26.579
"Dear Juliette,
I love you deeply.

02:26.646 --> 02:29.816
I hope these flowers bring
a smile to your face."

02:29.883 --> 02:34.854
{\an7}Alex posted a video of them,
too, like, making out,
and her in his lap.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.290
{\an1}I think she's strong,
and then she does things,

02:37.357 --> 02:39.559
{\an4}and I'm like, "Mm, maybe you're
not that strong, Juliette.

02:37.357 --> 02:39.559
{\an3}I know.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.896
{\an5}She goes, "Well,
he bought new sheets."
I'm like, oh, my God.

02:42.962 --> 02:46.232
{\an4}Getting new sheets
just says, like,
"I did hook up with them."

02:46.299 --> 02:49.936
{\an5}Alex has literally cheated
on every single girlfriend
he's had,

02:50.003 --> 02:52.772
{\an5}and once a cheater,
always a cheater.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.772

{\an4}(Debbie)
We forgot to put the feet
on this thing.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.886
{\an4}I think you need
to read the manual.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.886
(laughing)
All righty.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.589
{\an5}Is there a manual?

03:06.953 --> 03:09.589
{\an1}Yeah. I put the brakes on,
okay?

03:09.656 --> 03:11.524
(Juliette)
Say what you will about Kelsey,

03:11.591 --> 03:13.693
but when her mom
was diagnosed with MS,

03:13.760 --> 03:15.929
Kelsey gave up a career
to take care of her.

03:15.995 --> 03:19.566
{\an8}I can't even imagine how hard
that must be for both of them.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.501
{\an8}This is mortifying
to me.

03:21.568 --> 03:22.635
{\an8}I mean, to be sitting here
in a wheelchair.

03:22.702 --> 03:24.437
{\an8}Except I need to get
my ride pimped.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.972
{\an8}(both laughing)

03:26.039 --> 03:28.207
{\an1}It's cute. It's not bad.
I'll get you some streamers.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.476
{\an3}Yeah.

03:28.274 --> 03:30.476
Maybe a little horn.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.245
You know, we can feel
sorry for ourselves,

03:32.312 --> 03:35.915
or we can make the best
of everything that we can.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.217
{\an5}I know it's hard.

03:35.982 --> 03:38.217
We'll get through it.

03:38.284 --> 03:41.020
{\an4}To face it,
with your health
and everything.

03:41.087 --> 03:44.223
{\an4}I don't really have anyone
that I open up to
in this group.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.060
{\an4}I feel like I need that,
'cause I'm always, like,
holding in everything.

03:47.126 --> 03:50.663
{\an6}Uh, you do.

03:47.126 --> 03:50.663
{\an1}Yeah, and... Garrett's
the one person

03:50.730 --> 03:54.067
{\an1}that I have talked about,
like, your health to.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.835
{\an5}Well, and he knows
every-- our family,
he knows the situation.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.971
{\an1}Yeah, and he knows
the family and everything,

03:58.037 --> 04:00.139
{\an4}and it's not, like,
a relationship thing,
but it's just...

04:00.206 --> 04:03.576
{\an4}I don't know, like,
things have been super weird
between him and I, and...

04:03.643 --> 04:05.745
Well, what's weird is
that you guys,

04:05.812 --> 04:07.647
like, aren't friends.
I mean, like...

04:07.714 --> 04:11.017
{\an5}Yeah, I don't know--

04:07.714 --> 04:11.017
...I can't imagine.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.619
I don't know, like,
I just don't, like,

04:12.685 --> 04:15.121
{\an1}I do not trust the girl
he's with right now,

04:15.188 --> 04:17.991
{\an4}like... I have, like,
a gut feeling, and,
like, that's not--

04:18.057 --> 04:20.093
{\an4}I can't, like, say,
"I have a gut feeling
that this girl is just--"

04:20.159 --> 04:21.894
Yeah, you can base science
on those gut feelings.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.696
{\an1}Yeah, those gut feelings
are using you.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.298
You loved each other.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.298
{\an1}Yeah.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.267
{\an5}And that ended.
And you wish the best
for him,

04:28.334 --> 04:30.136
but you still have things
bothering you.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.939
{\an1}I think there's more
you're not even saying to me

04:33.006 --> 04:34.941
that are still, deep down,
that when you two start

04:35.008 --> 04:37.210
to have a dialogue,
that will come out.

{\an7}I don't want you
to leave me.

just hang out

05:13.680 --> 05:15.114
{\an9}I gotta go.

05:15.181 --> 05:18.284
{\an8}...I shut him down.
But then, I let him back in,

05:18.351 --> 05:21.554

judging me for it.

you're just taking space.

We're gonna be here

06:34.660 --> 06:36.362
(all)
Whoo!

06:36.429 --> 06:38.831
{\an1}That day at the sand bar
when Juliette left with Lexie,

06:38.898 --> 06:41.934
{\an7}Chloe and Amanda are both like,
"Yeah, you go, girl!
Leave by yourself."

06:42.001 --> 06:44.170
{\an8}And then, like,
the very next day,
I saw you guys

06:44.237 --> 06:46.739
{\an5}on, like, social media,
you're, like, driving the boat
with, like, your feet.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.808
{\an5}(Alex)
Oh, yeah.
The foot finesse.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.808
And I was like...

06:48.875 --> 06:50.977
There was an Instagram story
literally the next day

06:51.043 --> 06:52.545
{\an5}after we all had that boat day.

06:51.043 --> 06:52.545
Oh, of her on the boat.

06:52.612 --> 06:54.514
Of her on the boat, and she was,
like, sitting in his lap.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.349
Not sitting in his lap, like...

06:56.415 --> 07:01.220
{\an4}he's, like, cradling her--
he's, like, cradling her
like a baby.

07:01.287 --> 07:02.922
And she's like... mwah!

07:02.989 --> 07:05.324
(smooching and laughing)

07:05.391 --> 07:08.060
{\an1}We're fine when it's just us,
but she's so afraid

07:08.127 --> 07:12.131
that Amanda and Chloe will
continue to just badger her

07:12.198 --> 07:13.733
about her being
with me and...

07:13.800 --> 07:15.501
{\an1}She's, like, listening
to what they say about you,

07:15.568 --> 07:17.837
{\an4}but honestly, like,
she acts different
when it's just you and her.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.739
She knows I care
about her.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.809
{\an5}So what were you saying,
telling me outside?
I'm so confused.

07:22.875 --> 07:26.679
{\an1}Um, I'm sure you know
of Friday night.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.014
When Juliette went over
to his house

07:28.080 --> 07:29.482
{\an5}in the morning
and found a girl
in the bed?

07:29.549 --> 07:30.750
{\an1}Yeah, okay,
so you know about that.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.785
{\an8}That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:32.852 --> 07:35.988
{\an8}(Juliette)
You're probably wondering who
the hell this Shelby girl is.

07:36.055 --> 07:38.758
{\an8}Well, she's one of Chloe's
closest friends.

07:38.825 --> 07:42.962
{\an8}And she's been dating Alex's
best friend Drew
basically forever.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.832
{\an8}So she's known the whole crew
even longer than me.

07:45.898 --> 07:47.033
And any gossip
that comes from her,

07:47.099 --> 07:49.569
Chloe's gonna take it
as a fact.

07:49.635 --> 07:52.839
{\an1}Alex was FaceTiming Drew,
and...

07:52.905 --> 07:56.175
I don't think that Alex knew
I was in the car with Drew,

07:56.242 --> 08:00.413
{\an1}and what Alex said to Drew
was...

08:00.479 --> 08:03.850
{\an1}implying that they
hooked up.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.352
{\an3}God.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.988
{\an1}I basically overheard him
telling Drew everything

08:09.055 --> 08:10.823
{\an1}as a best friend
would tell a best friend.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.526
Did Alex have sex
with this girl?

08:13.593 --> 08:15.294
Yeah, 100%.

08:15.361 --> 08:16.362
A hundred percent?

08:16.429 --> 08:18.965
{\an5}A thousand percent.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.965
What did he say?

08:19.031 --> 08:21.100
{\an1}Well, you know how Alex is.
He's very vulgar.

08:21.167 --> 08:26.806
{\an1}And I heard him explicitly talk
about her... you know.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.674
{\an5}He talked about
her vagina?

08:26.873 --> 08:28.674
{\an1}Yeah.

08:28.741 --> 08:32.111
{\an1}He said that
it was... (bleep).

08:32.178 --> 08:34.013
You heard him
say that?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.780
{\an1}Yes, I heard him
say that.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.183
{\an1}He knows that he's
so caught this time.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.519
{\an1}He doesn't know how he's
gonna get out of this one.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.289
Wait, so hold on.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.958
{\an1}The big thing is,
from what Amanda's told me,

08:46.025 --> 08:47.994
and this is
my girl's house,

08:48.060 --> 08:50.630
she doesn't want
this kind of drama here.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.399
{\an1}So as much as I wanna run
to Juliette and tell her this,

08:53.466 --> 08:55.801
{\an5}because she deserves
to know...

08:53.466 --> 08:55.801
{\an1}Yeah.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.537
{\an4}...I'm not gonna do it here
'cause Amanda doesn't want
that drama here.

08:58.604 --> 09:02.208
{\an5}Let's just, like,
re-talk tonight,
have a good time,

09:02.275 --> 09:03.943
and, like, if I feel
like it's right...

09:04.010 --> 09:07.113

she deserves to know.

I'll just rush out
on my boat.

15:10.709 --> 15:14.346
{\an5}We can take the boat out
right now and just say
screw all the BS.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.949
I don't know
exactly, like,

15:17.016 --> 15:20.052
{\an5}what Alex said to you--

15:17.016 --> 15:20.052
So what did you hear?

15:20.119 --> 15:23.055
So Alex was FaceTiming
Drew in the car,

15:23.122 --> 15:25.658
and he had no idea
that I was in the car.

15:25.724 --> 15:29.295
I know that the girl
and Alex had sex.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.265
{\an1}He said, "I really
got caught this time.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.734
{\an1}"I don't know how
I'm getting out of this one.

15:35.801 --> 15:37.670
{\an1}At least her (bleep)
was so (bleep)."

15:37.736 --> 15:39.004
{\an6}Listen...

15:37.736 --> 15:39.004
Oh, my God.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.939
(indistinct background chatter)

15:41.006 --> 15:43.208
{\an4}(Chloe)
Juliette, come here.
Juliette.

15:45.511 --> 15:49.982
Did you have sex with that girl?
Tell me the truth.

15:50.049 --> 15:51.817
I'm not feeding into this.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.153
I didn't do (bleep).
Shut up!

15:54.219 --> 15:55.487
{\an5}Don't get mad,
don't get mad,
don't get mad.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.189
{\an5}No, (bleep) this.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.189
I know, but--

15:57.256 --> 15:58.891
If I slept with her,
I would say yeah.

15:58.957 --> 16:01.126
We didn't talk
for "X" amount of hours.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.329
I slept with someone else
in her-- whatever.

16:03.395 --> 16:06.465
I'm not gonna entertain
this conversation anymore.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.702
{\an5}I've told you time
after time after time,
I did not do anything.

16:09.768 --> 16:11.203
I will forgive you
if you tell me.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.872
Okay, well, forgive nothing,
because I did nothing wrong.

16:13.939 --> 16:15.941
{\an1}You said her (bleep) was
so (bleep) to Drew.

16:16.008 --> 16:17.776
{\an1}You said that to Drew.
Shelby heard you.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.312
{\an4}(Drew)
He did not say this.
That is not true.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.312
Shelby was in the car.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.681
{\an4}Shelby was in the car
and heard it, so now you're
saying Shelby was lying.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.681
Oh, you look shocked.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.316
{\an5}That is not true.
That's not--
that's not true.

16:24.383 --> 16:25.884
{\an1}(Chloe)
So Shelby's lying?

16:25.951 --> 16:27.086
{\an4}(Drew)
Shelby's not lying.
That is not true.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.221
{\an5}It is true.

16:27.152 --> 16:29.221
No, it's not.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.890
{\an5}Drew, yes it is!

16:29.288 --> 16:31.890
{\an1}She's just being
a good-- a good person.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.225
{\an5}I listened.

16:31.957 --> 16:33.225
You did not.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.728
I never said (bleep).
It was a joke.

16:35.794 --> 16:36.829
{\an5}(laughing)

16:35.794 --> 16:36.829
I-I feel like--

16:36.895 --> 16:38.130
And I-I don't
even think I s--

16:38.197 --> 16:39.598
I don't even remember
saying that.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.134
I didn't cheat
on you, Juliette.

16:44.470 --> 16:45.838
(Chloe)
You didn't?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.041
{\an3}Did not.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.576
{\an1}It got really quiet
just now.

16:50.642 --> 16:53.011
{\an5}(Chloe)
It got...

16:50.642 --> 16:53.011
Real quiet.

16:54.713 --> 16:57.349
{\an5}So you better
tell your (bleep)
to get under control.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.985
{\an4}Bro, (bleep).
'Cause I didn't say that,
and she's over there talking...

17:00.052 --> 17:01.887
I said that.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.887
Like, right now.

17:03.956 --> 17:05.624
Look, the reason
that I'm saying anything

17:05.691 --> 17:08.394
{\an1}in the first place is because
I heard you saying,

17:08.460 --> 17:12.064
{\an5}"I need someone
to tell me what's right
or what's not right."

17:12.131 --> 17:13.565
And I feel guilty
standing there--

17:13.632 --> 17:15.099
That-- that is not true.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.869
Don't say this (bleep).
That is not true.

17:17.935 --> 17:19.070
{\an3}It is true.

17:19.137 --> 17:21.607
It's okay.
Thank you. Thank you.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.775
(Drew)
That is not true.

17:22.840 --> 17:24.510
{\an5}Drew, this...

17:22.840 --> 17:24.510
Everything he says.

17:24.576 --> 17:26.979
{\an1}...isn't your problem,
and I know you feel like it is,

17:27.045 --> 17:28.714
{\an1}and he's gonna make it feel
like your problem.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.216
{\an4}It's not yours,
and I'm sorry that you're
in the middle of this.

17:31.283 --> 17:33.118
{\an4}(Chloe)
You gotta feel like you
gotta defend him.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.154
{\an4}Shelby's--
Shelby's not gonna lie.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.154
I don't have to feel like--

17:35.220 --> 17:37.856
L-Let's just be honest.
Yeah, typically, girls

17:37.923 --> 17:40.025
that you meet on the first night
are super tight, right?

17:40.092 --> 17:43.462
{\an5}What am I referencing
is "tight"?

17:40.092 --> 17:43.462
{\an4}(Chloe)
Her-- oh, there it is.
There it is.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.931
{\an5}(Alex)
I'm just trying not to be dirty.

17:43.529 --> 17:45.931
Listen, Alex--

17:45.998 --> 17:47.566
Shelby, why don't you shut
the (bleep) up?

17:47.633 --> 17:49.201
'Cause you have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.804
{\an5}Do not speak to her
that way.

17:49.268 --> 17:51.804
{\an1}Listen...

17:51.870 --> 17:54.807
{\an5}Don't speak to any female
that way ever again
in your life.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.742
You shut up too.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.742
{\an1}It's fine.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.977
{\an5}This is where you're
gonna learn you cannot
talk to women that way.

17:59.044 --> 18:02.581
{\an4}The reason he's so mad
is because he's caught
and he knows he got caught.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.083
{\an5}I didn't get caught!
You shut the (bleep) up!

18:02.648 --> 18:05.083
Stop, stop.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.186
And tell your (bleep)
to shut the (bleep) up too!

18:07.252 --> 18:08.687
{\an5}Why are you getting
so mad then?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.687
Let's go take a walk.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.290
Don't get mad.
Don't get mad.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.459
{\an5}Let me talk to you.

18:11.356 --> 18:13.459
(bleep).
Shut up, you drunk idiot.

18:13.525 --> 18:15.561
{\an4}(Drew)
Come on, come talk to me
over here.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.129
{\an1}Nah, dude, Drew, you can go
(bleep) yourself too.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.331
Dude, you act like
I did this (bleep), man.

18:19.398 --> 18:21.733
{\an4}I didn't do anything wrong.
She's over there
making lies up.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.436
{\an5}I know she is, that's why
I'm trying to do that.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.436
Then better go grab her.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.472
I am. I was literally
just over there like,

18:26.538 --> 18:29.141
{\an5}"That's not true."
Why-- how you gonna
sit here and yell at me?

18:29.208 --> 18:31.877
{\an5}I'm on your (bleep) side.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.877
(bleep) you, Chloe.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.246

19:03.208 --> 19:06.211
{\an8}Yeah, it was.

19:06.278 --> 19:10.048

to (bleep) when we
went out later.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.287

19:17.623 --> 19:19.024
That was right

19:19.091 --> 19:20.759
{\an1}Alex was the most disrespectful

{\an5}I've never seen someone...

19:20.826 --> 19:23.562
Like, the way--

19:23.629 --> 19:24.863
...talk to people like that.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.465
It was like,
"Shut your (bleep) up".

19:26.532 --> 19:28.500
{\an5}Like, he literally
said that so many times.

19:26.532 --> 19:28.500
{\an1}Yeah.

19:28.567 --> 19:30.869
Like, I don't get
the people around here.

19:30.936 --> 19:33.972
{\an1}And for whatever reason,
Kelsey coming over,

19:34.039 --> 19:37.309
{\an5}which was-- I mean,
I knew that, like...

19:34.039 --> 19:37.309
She really,
like, exploded.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.778
{\an4}I think she did it, like,
two or three times.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.778
I've never even had
a conversation with her.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.747
Like, how would she know
if I'm a bitch or not?

19:41.813 --> 19:44.483
{\an4}Well, exactly.
It's just not fair
to, you know, be like that.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.718
{\an5}You don't see me
over there, like,
always commenting

19:46.785 --> 19:49.388
{\an1}on her and her relationship,
you know?

19:49.454 --> 19:53.392
{\an5}Well, why do you think she
thinks our relationship
isn't genuine?

19:53.458 --> 19:56.328
{\an4}Whatever she heard
from somebody,
she was believing.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.400
How did that second
conversation go?

20:01.466 --> 20:03.602
{\an1}I don't know if you know,
but her mom has MS.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.971
{\an5}That's so sad.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.971
And I do love her mom
and, like, her family.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.639
{\an1}So, like, you know,
that definitely hit me

20:07.706 --> 20:10.275
{\an1}that she does have
a lot going on in her life.

20:10.342 --> 20:12.377
{\an1}So, you know, like,
the best thing I could do

20:12.444 --> 20:14.346
{\an1}was at least, you know,
hear her out and talk to her

20:14.413 --> 20:16.381
{\an1}and say that, you know,
I'd like to say

20:16.448 --> 20:18.050
{\an4}that I'm sorry
and I'm not
the type of person

20:18.116 --> 20:20.052
{\an4}that just cut out
everything--

20:18.116 --> 20:20.052
Yeah, I know.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.087
{\an1}You know,
that's not me.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.557
{\an1}Do you think maybe Kelsey
still has feelings for you?

20:29.761 --> 20:32.230
{\an1}Yeah.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.465
I realistically don't think

20:33.532 --> 20:35.300
{\an1}she cares about anybody
but herself.

20:35.367 --> 20:37.502
Yeah, she's the worst.

20:37.569 --> 20:40.038

(both laughing)

21:09.001 --> 21:11.169
{\an5}(Juliette)
We all went to high school
with Jared.

21:11.236 --> 21:15.240
{\an5}But after graduation,
he took a different path
than the rest of us.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.242
He was in the Navy
for six years.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.877
We had like,
aircraft go down.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.413
We're the people that had
to transport them to land.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.684
{\an5}So it's like pulling people
out of the water-type deal.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.684
Oh, my God.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.053
{\an5}(Juliette)
And he came home with scars
to prove it.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.055
{\an5}Hey, guys, how you doing?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.055
Can I get an iced tea?

21:30.122 --> 21:34.526
{\an5}Absolutely.

21:30.122 --> 21:34.526
{\an1}I... will do
another vodka Sprite.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.428
You got it.

21:36.495 --> 21:40.298
{\an5}Jared, are you really
drinking vodka Sprite
right now?

21:40.365 --> 21:42.801
{\an1}That's like
a morning drink.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.903
What is that?

21:42.868 --> 21:44.903
{\an1}My sword.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.906
{\an5}You have swords
in the Navy?

21:44.970 --> 21:47.906
{\an1}No, they do
in the Army, though.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.509
{\an5}No, there's, like,
no hand-to-hand combat
anymore, is there?

21:50.575 --> 21:53.645
{\an1}Oh, yeah.

21:50.575 --> 21:53.645
Not actually.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.214
{\an5}No, definitely, actually.

21:53.712 --> 21:56.214
What? Oh my God.

21:56.281 --> 21:58.050
{\an1}(laughing)

21:56.281 --> 21:58.050
{\an3}Okay.

21:58.116 --> 22:02.220
{\an5}How's making, like,
the transition
from being in the Navy?

22:02.287 --> 22:06.324
{\an1}What's another word
for... awful?

22:06.391 --> 22:08.593
{\an4}Before, I felt like
I was doing something,
you know?

22:08.660 --> 22:13.065
{\an4}Like, I was actually out there
doing something, you know,
like, I was somebody.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.534
Okay, but you are.
You are something.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.335
{\an1}You know, some people,
like, wanna get out.

22:17.402 --> 22:19.237
{\an1}It's like,
I didn't wanna get out.

22:19.304 --> 22:20.972
I just... had to.

22:19.304 --> 22:20.972
{\an3}Really?

22:21.039 --> 22:23.575
I feel terrible.
Like, I have to apologize.

22:23.642 --> 22:25.477
After you asked me out,

22:25.544 --> 22:27.646
I felt like I couldn't
be there for you

22:27.713 --> 22:28.914
in the way
that you needed.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.849
I'm sorry,
and I wanna be there

22:30.916 --> 22:33.752
for you and you
have not left my mind.

22:33.819 --> 22:35.120
So, like,
I do care about you,

22:35.187 --> 22:36.922
and I want you to know
that I'm here.

22:36.988 --> 22:39.191
And I obviously
haven't proven that.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.826
But moving forward, like--

22:40.892 --> 22:42.961
{\an1}Well, your apology's
accepted.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.031
{\an6}Thank you.
Thank you.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.031
Don't worry about it.

22:46.098 --> 22:49.501
{\an5}So how are you, like,
coping with things
now that you're here?

22:50.535 --> 22:52.604
{\an1}I start drinking
at 11:00.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.542
{\an5}Do you drink
every day?

22:55.040 --> 22:57.542
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

22:57.609 --> 23:00.045
Are there, like,
specific thoughts

23:00.112 --> 23:01.680
you're trying to escape
or is it,

23:01.747 --> 23:03.582
like, just a feeling,
or...?

23:03.648 --> 23:07.018
{\an4}I get, like,
terrible nightmares,
I can never sleep.

23:07.085 --> 23:11.389
{\an5}Have you...
thought of talking
to anyone?

23:11.456 --> 23:14.192
{\an1}No.

23:14.259 --> 23:18.096
But I'm okay with being
depressed all the time.

23:18.163 --> 23:21.633
It became normal that I just
feel like (bleep) every day.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.702
And it's like, I don't like
people thinking I'm crazy.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.538
{\an4}Like, everyone thinks
I'm crazy.

23:23.769 --> 23:26.538
You're not crazy.
You're not crazy.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.574
{\an4}I don't like the fact
that someone looks at me
and that's what they think.

23:29.641 --> 23:33.578
{\an4}They're like, oh, this guy's
gonna lose his mind
any second now.

23:33.645 --> 23:35.514
I feel broken.

23:41.319 --> 23:46.158
{\an7}(crying)
I don't care what you guys say.
I pray that he will be better.

23:46.224 --> 23:49.261
{\an1}I've heard that so many times,
and it's just never better.

23:49.327 --> 23:50.262
(sobbing)

23:54.966 --> 23:59.037
{\an8}♪♪

23:59.104 --> 24:00.372
(door slamming loudly)

24:00.438 --> 24:02.407
{\an1}(Alex laughing)
Yo, what are you doing?

24:02.474 --> 24:05.076
{\an5}(Pauly)
This is the (bleep) door
at Winterfell.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.379
{\an8}I need a drink.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.379
{\an8}You need a lawyer.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.947
{\an9}Damn right.

24:09.014 --> 24:11.149
{\an8}(Juliette)
Pauly's kind of a train wreck...

24:11.216 --> 24:12.484
{\an8}Paul's in jail.

24:12.551 --> 24:14.219
{\an8}(Juliette)
...and always has been.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.320
{\an7}(man)
How many times
you been locked up?

24:15.387 --> 24:17.088
{\an8}Like, ten times.

24:15.387 --> 24:17.088
{\an7}Ten times?

24:17.155 --> 24:20.325
{\an8}(Juliette)
And now he's got another warrant
out for his arrest.

24:20.392 --> 24:22.994
{\an7}I couldn't imagine, like,
the pressure of just knowing

24:23.061 --> 24:26.231
{\an4}that any moment you could get
pulled over and they'll just
take you in.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.933
{\an5}Hey, listen--

24:26.298 --> 24:27.933
Full-fledged warrant?

24:27.999 --> 24:29.467
We all make mistakes.

24:29.534 --> 24:31.703
{\an1}I hear you on that one,
but this was stupid.

24:31.770 --> 24:34.406
{\an5}(sighing)
What's taking so long
with your dad?

24:34.472 --> 24:37.108
{\an1}I feel like I'm waiting
outside the principal's office.

24:37.175 --> 24:38.643
{\an1}Your chest starting
to beat a little bit?

24:38.710 --> 24:41.413
{\an5}(chuckles)
I'm sweating bullets
over here.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.019
Hey.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.019
{\an3}Hey.

24:48.086 --> 24:50.689
So I got the call last night.
So what happened now?

24:50.755 --> 24:54.025
{\an8}I got a warrant out
for my arrest
for an open container.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.295
{\an5}And why is there a warrant
for your arrest?

24:54.092 --> 24:57.295
{\an1}'Cause he forgot
to appear.

24:57.362 --> 24:59.631
{\an1}I forgot to appear in court
for the open container.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.266
Didn't we have
a conversation about this

25:01.333 --> 25:03.301
on the last time around?

25:03.368 --> 25:05.237
You're supposed to learn
from your mistakes,

25:05.303 --> 25:06.605
and that's how you
become a better person.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.273
Is it really that big
of a deal, though?

25:08.340 --> 25:10.842
{\an1}It's an open container.
If we can just get me a lawyer--

25:10.909 --> 25:14.446
It's a pattern of behavior.
Bad stuff always follows you.

25:14.512 --> 25:18.083
{\an5}That's never been the case.

25:14.512 --> 25:18.083
{\an1}All right, well, you're gonna
get this resolved for him.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.118
{\an5}I'm not gonna
get (bleep) resolved.

25:18.149 --> 25:20.118
{\an1}Well, you're gonna get
a lawyer for him.

25:20.185 --> 25:22.454
I'm gonna get a lawyer for him
and let him go pay the lawyer.

25:22.520 --> 25:24.222
And the lawyer might tell him
the same thing I'm telling him.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.690
If my grandmother
finds out about this...

25:25.757 --> 25:27.359
Well, the best way
for your grandma not to find out

25:27.425 --> 25:29.160
is not to keep doing this sh--
this stuff.

25:29.227 --> 25:32.731
{\an5}Dad, can you just listen?
Like, he just wants
to get this taken care of.

25:32.797 --> 25:35.233
I know you're yelling
in there and not giving a crap.

25:35.300 --> 25:36.801
I know, you don't
wanna listen to it.

25:36.868 --> 25:38.637
Same thing, it's going
in one ear and out the other.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.071
There's a consequence
to everything.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.573
You can't just do what
you wanna do

25:41.640 --> 25:44.843
and think things
aren't gonna happen bad.

25:44.910 --> 25:50.515

{\an5}Well, is Juliette gonna
give you another chance
and move on?

26:50.608 --> 26:52.010
{\an1}Or is she gonna harp on this

26:52.077 --> 26:54.779
{\an1}Well, that's like-- that's what
I'm worried about, man.

26:54.846 --> 26:58.783
I'm obviously, like, devastated
over what Shelby told me.

26:58.850 --> 27:04.189
{\an1}Um, I really don't know
if Shelby's telling the truth

27:04.255 --> 27:08.660
{\an1}or if Alex is telling
some truth, but...

27:08.727 --> 27:12.130
I just, in my heart, like,
I want you to know

27:12.197 --> 27:16.167

really insane for Shelby

27:20.739 --> 27:22.774
She's telling you
because she respects you

27:22.841 --> 27:25.577
{\an5}and she feels like
if that was her
in that situation,

27:25.643 --> 27:27.245
she would want somebody
to tell her.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.947

{\an5}I'm just gonna think
with my heart

27:36.254 --> 27:40.125
{\an5}Oh, then he'll suck you
right back in.

27:36.254 --> 27:40.125
Of course he will.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.927
{\an1}There's so many people that,
like, just invest so much time

27:42.994 --> 27:46.664
{\an4}into, like, try to, like,
"deteriate" my relationship
with Juliette.

27:46.731 --> 27:49.768
{\an1}Chloe low-key just wants

I would get a girlfriend,
she would lose that ranking.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.175

31:06.064 --> 31:08.333
{\an1}With all these different girls,

31:08.399 --> 31:10.401
{\an1}what girl in Siesta Key
would that be?

31:10.468 --> 31:13.938

But where's the love?

31:14.005 --> 31:16.341
{\an1}(sighs)
Still with Madisson?

31:16.407 --> 31:20.378
I don't know.
Playing the long game.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.247
I mean, like, we talk,
like, we're friends.

31:22.313 --> 31:24.415
We've hung out, like,
once or twice, but it's...

31:24.482 --> 31:26.217

31:26.284 --> 31:30.121
{\an4}Okay.

31:26.284 --> 31:30.121

out on a date.

31:30.188 --> 31:32.657

{\an7}I know it hurts that
you're not there anymore,

see you being an alcoholic

31:51.976 --> 31:54.412

and everybody else.

31:54.479 --> 31:58.483
{\an7}I can see you're going
down the wrong path.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.688
{\an5}She knows, like,
I have a bunch
of problems and stuff.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.556
{\an1}She's like, you're drinking
'cause you're depressed

that's helping you?

make you more depressed.

32:09.127 --> 32:10.995
{\an1}I mean, I understand
to an extent.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.064
{\an1}I try to stay away
from drinking when I'm sad.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.533
{\an1}Like, it's never made me
feel better when I was sad.

32:15.600 --> 32:16.934
{\an3}Yeah.

you have it.

{\an4}I mean, you can't run away
from anything, like,
no matter where you go.

32:33.951 --> 32:37.088

Seeing my mom...
that emotional

32:46.831 --> 32:50.501
{\an1}So I'm definitely gonna start
looking into therapy.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.403
There's, like,
one lady that works

39:36.073 --> 39:38.876
But at the end of the day,
you had a girl in your bed.

39:38.943 --> 39:41.078
{\an4}And at the end of the day,
you FaceTimed Drew

39:41.145 --> 39:42.580
{\an1}and talked about
having sex with her.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.582
{\an5}So if you can go...

39:42.646 --> 39:44.582
That is all BS.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.883
{\an1}The way I treat yo--
I'm talking!

39:45.950 --> 39:47.284
Everyone knows it.
Everyone knows it.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.819
You just talked,
I'm talking now.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.221
{\an1}Shut your mouth
for once in your life.

39:50.287 --> 39:51.288
There you go,
there you go.

39:51.355 --> 39:52.823
I'm talking!

39:52.890 --> 39:56.026
{\an1}Everybody in our group knows
you cheated on Juliette.

39:56.093 --> 39:57.428
Everyone in this group.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.730
{\an1}I'm the only one that's
woman enough to admit to you

39:59.797 --> 40:01.432
what everyone says
behind your back.

40:01.499 --> 40:02.933
{\an5}'Cause I'm so awful.

40:01.499 --> 40:02.933
She's coming back to you

40:03.000 --> 40:05.069
{\an1}because she's really, really
damaged as a human being,

40:05.136 --> 40:06.837
{\an1}and you are the person
that continues to damage her.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.339
And you are-- you should
be a counselor.

40:08.405 --> 40:09.607
You should stop
going to counseling

40:09.673 --> 40:11.709
and become a counselor.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.978
I stuck up for you
for years and years,

40:14.044 --> 40:15.513
{\an5}and I wish I didn't.

40:14.044 --> 40:15.513
Oh, my God!

40:15.579 --> 40:17.348
{\an1}Thank you, Alex!
Thank you!

40:17.414 --> 40:19.483
{\an1}Like, what do you want?
You want me to bow to you?

40:19.550 --> 40:20.818
No, this is exactly why

40:20.885 --> 40:22.520
I don't ever want
to be your friend.

40:22.586 --> 40:23.687
{\an1}Because you don't
believe me, you don't care.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.456
{\an1}Oh, you're not ending
this friendship.

40:25.523 --> 40:26.991
{\an5}I'm ending this friendship.

40:25.523 --> 40:26.991
No, I'm ending this.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.559
{\an1}I want nothing to do
with you.

40:28.626 --> 40:30.728
{\an1}I don't wanna be your friend,
you don't wanna be mine.

40:30.795 --> 40:33.798
{\an8}So go enjoy
your perfect life.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.099
{\an8}But just know that like,

40:35.166 --> 40:37.368
{\an8}you just lost one of
your big-time players

40:37.434 --> 40:38.569
{\an8}that really was there
for you.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.137
{\an8}It's fine with me.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.137
{\an9}Good.

40:40.204 --> 40:42.273
{\an7}Somebody like you,
I don't want to be
friends with anyways.

40:42.339 --> 40:44.642
{\an8}Have a wonderful life.

40:44.708 --> 40:45.709
{\an8}♪♪

40:45.776 --> 40:46.944
{\an8}(Chloe)
Piece of (bleep)!

40:47.011 --> 40:48.512
{\an7}(Alex)
You're the piece of (bleep)

40:48.579 --> 40:50.047
{\an8}and everyone knows it.
