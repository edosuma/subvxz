- [narrator] Previously on Lost:
- We think you're special.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.163
We want you to lead a team
of highly trained people.

00:07.258 --> 00:10.466
- How was the interview?
- Why would I want to go to Portland

00:10.553 --> 00:14.842
- for research that doesn't even work?
- Because it does work. I'm pregnant.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.717
[sobbing] My whole life,
all I ever wanted was to have a baby

00:18.811 --> 00:20.802
and now because of you I can!

00:20.897 --> 00:22.182
I know you don't care,

00:22.273 --> 00:26.812
but the people I spent the last three
years of my life with just left me.

00:26.903 --> 00:28.518
- You OK?
- Yeah.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.774
- She's not coming with us.
- Yes, she is.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.652
- Why?
- Because they left her behind, too.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.179
[sloshing]

01:09.362 --> 01:10.818
It's getting late.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.563
This is a good place to make camp.

01:20.331 --> 01:22.788
- I'll get some firewood.
- I'll go with you.

01:47.692 --> 01:49.273
Do you want to talk about it?

01:50.861 --> 01:52.192
Talk about what?

01:52.863 --> 01:56.572
About the week
you spent over there with them.

01:59.328 --> 02:03.788
Well, after you left, I'd, uh...
I'd made a deal with them.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.741
If I took care of Ben,
that they'd let me off the island.

02:06.836 --> 02:10.124
So ljust kept my head down,
did what I was supposed to,

02:11.424 --> 02:13.335
and I didn't ask any questions.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.463
And that's it?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.467
That's it.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.443
OK, let's have it.

02:45.124 --> 02:47.991
I want to know what you people
are doing on this island,

02:48.085 --> 02:53.500
why you're terrorizing us,
making lists, kidnapping children.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.295
I want to know everything.

02:58.471 --> 03:02.714
But the first thing I'd like to know is,
who are you?

03:09.565 --> 03:12.773
[Jâ€˜ Petula Clark: Downtown on radio]

03:17.531 --> 03:21.444
Hi. I'm Juliet Burke,
I'm with Mittelos Bioscience.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.572
- I'll let Mr. Alpert know you're here.
- Thank you.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.529
Well.

03:26.624 --> 03:27.955
[both chuckling]

03:28.834 --> 03:32.543
They're taking this corporate
secrecy thing a little too seriously.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.791
I'm never gonna fit in
with these people.

03:38.052 --> 03:40.794
Dr. Burke, if you pop the trunk,
I'll get your bags.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.344
[Juliet] Thank you.

03:48.104 --> 03:49.469
You managed to find us?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.554
I didn't know they had an airport here.

03:51.649 --> 03:54.641
lt surprises everyone.
Hi, you must be Rachel.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.817
- Richard Alpert.
- Nice to meet you.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.737
Thanks for letting us borrow
your sister for a few months.

03:59.824 --> 04:01.985
Promise you'll bring her back
in one piece.

04:02.076 --> 04:03.156
We'll do our best.

04:03.244 --> 04:06.736
Uh... So listen, it's a security thing.

04:06.831 --> 04:09.322
We have to take you in
the rest of the way.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.124
Whenever you're ready
we'll be waiting over here.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.417
Please take your time.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.165
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Thanks.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.541
Thank you.

04:23.347 --> 04:26.009
- It's better this way.
- Is this a mistake?

04:26.684 --> 04:28.220
What if you get sick again?

04:28.310 --> 04:30.175
I won't. Cancer's gone,

04:30.271 --> 04:33.934
and I'm 100 percent preggers,
thanks to you.

04:34.984 --> 04:36.645
- I'll be back...
- Yes, I know.

04:36.735 --> 04:40.774
- ...before you give birth. I promise.
- I know. Don't worry about us. OK?

04:40.865 --> 04:42.526
OK.

04:43.117 --> 04:47.326
You've spent your whole life working
to get here. So, don't blow it.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.032
- I love you.
- I love you.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.842
- OK.
- Go make us proud.

05:06.724 --> 05:07.839
Ma'am.

05:09.310 --> 05:10.470
Bye.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.148
Who are you?

05:27.036 --> 05:28.992
If I told you who I was,

05:29.830 --> 05:32.162
if I told you everything that I know,

05:32.249 --> 05:34.035
you'd kill me.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.540
What do you think I'll do if you don't?

05:39.423 --> 05:41.755
- [logs rattle]
- [Jack] Leave her alone.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.216
Sooner or later,
she'll answer my questions.

05:48.807 --> 05:51.344
She'll answer your questions
when she's ready.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.300
And you'll wait until she is.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.012
She's under my protection.

[Aaron crying]

06:45.823 --> 06:47.029
Claire?

06:52.121 --> 06:53.327
Claire!

06:54.039 --> 06:55.449
Claire?

06:58.168 --> 07:00.659
What is it?
Oh, it's OK.

07:01.672 --> 07:03.663
Yeah, it's OK.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.590
OK. It's OK.
Claire? Hey.

07:07.386 --> 07:08.466
Claire?

07:08.554 --> 07:10.010
You OK?

07:10.889 --> 07:12.345
Charlie?

07:13.183 --> 07:15.890
- What's going on?
- Didn't you hear Aaron?

07:15.978 --> 07:18.515
- Is he OK?
- No, he's OK, he's OK.

07:19.315 --> 07:21.681
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, ljust...

07:21.775 --> 07:25.188
just feel a little bit off.
I didn't sleep well.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.736
I can't believe
I didn't hear him crying.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.939
Maybe you're coming down
with something.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.992
Why don't you let me take Aaron
and you get some more rest?

07:34.038 --> 07:36.620
- Yeah, do you mind?
- Absolutely. Hey.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.206
I won't sleep long.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.205
[machete hacking branches]

07:53.057 --> 07:55.594
I guess it's no use
asking them to wait up, huh?

07:56.894 --> 07:59.306
They'll come around.
Just give them some time.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.809
My people kept Sayid chained
to a swing set for three days.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.518
I dragged Kate into the jungle,
handcuffed myself to her, and lied.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.944
How much time do you think they need?

08:11.241 --> 08:15.234
We'll be to our beach in a couple hours.
They'll probably be over it by then.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.531
- You nervous?
- Hell, yes.

08:24.171 --> 08:27.004
I know that, uh, six months
sounds like an eternity,

08:27.091 --> 08:30.083
but you'll be amazed
at how time flies once you're there.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.293
I can't wait to find out
where "there" is.

08:32.388 --> 08:36.176
Dr. Burke, wanna have a seat?
I'd like to take some of your vitals.

08:37.309 --> 08:40.927
- If that's OK with you?
- Yeah. Sure.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.439
Everyone at the company
is really excited

08:46.527 --> 08:48.438
about you coming down, Dr. Burke.

08:48.529 --> 08:52.147
And I think your research is really
going to have a major impact on us.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.710
- What is that?
- That is orange juice

09:03.794 --> 09:06.706
with a considerable amount
of tranquilizer mixed in.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.668
- You want me to drink it?
- Yes.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.874
You'll want to be asleep for the trip.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.255
It can be kind of intense.

09:15.139 --> 09:19.132
OK. lwas fine
with signing all of your papenrvork,

09:19.226 --> 09:23.094
fine with agreeing to not talk
to anyone in my life for six months,

09:23.188 --> 09:26.726
fine with the fact that no one
has ever heard of Mittelos Bioscience.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.900
- Why were you fine?
- What?

09:29.987 --> 09:34.526
Why were you fine with those things?
It's quite a leap for a job opportunity.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.528
And we're not paying you that much.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.617
I think you're fine because,
deep down, a part of you knows

09:42.708 --> 09:46.075
that the place
we're taking you to is special.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.419
Special, huh?

09:49.506 --> 09:51.758
Let me ask you something, Juliet.

09:53.844 --> 09:56.426
You took a woman, your own sister,

09:56.513 --> 09:59.846
whose reproductive system
was ravaged by chemotherapy,

09:59.933 --> 10:02.766
who was sterile,
and you made her pregnant.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.890
You created life where life wasn't
supposed to be.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.437
That's a gift, Juliet.
You have a gift.

10:12.029 --> 10:15.863
Don't you feel you're meant to do
something significant with it?

10:18.327 --> 10:21.410
Where we're going, you can do just that.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.449
- Where exactly are we going?
- I can't tell you that.

10:27.544 --> 10:31.036
But what I can tell you
is that you'll see things there

10:31.131 --> 10:33.213
that you never imagined.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.504
No one is forcing you to do anything.

10:39.598 --> 10:42.635
If you change your mind,
we're happy to take you back to...

10:44.978 --> 10:47.310
[gulping]

10:49.858 --> 10:53.692
Um, you probably shouldn't have
drunk that so fast.

11:02.120 --> 11:03.735
[man talking, indistinct]

11:11.922 --> 11:13.583
- Good morning.
- [panting]

11:15.008 --> 11:16.214
No, no, it's OK.

11:16.301 --> 11:19.088
You'll be hoarse for a few hours,
but it gets better.

11:19.179 --> 11:23.013
Sorry I had to strap you in, but
the last leg is always a little bumpy.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.306
Watch your head.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.429
Gimme your hand.

11:47.958 --> 11:50.665
- We're here.
- Here, where?

Hello, Dr. Burke.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.477
My name is Benjamin Linus.

13:04.534 --> 13:07.697
I'm really looking fon/vard
to working with you.

13:07.788 --> 13:09.198
Watch your step here.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.791
Hey, that's too much water.
It's gonna be all soggy.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.423
lt's oatmeal, dude.
It's supposed to be soggy.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.797
Well, if it ain't Three Men and a Baby.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.138
I counted Hugo twice.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.187
What? Come on, | used your name.

13:38.986 --> 13:42.319
Hey. Does anybody know
where there's any aspirin?

13:42.406 --> 13:45.364
- Claire, you don't look so good.
- What are you doing up?

13:45.450 --> 13:48.112
- You're meant to be in bed.
- Yeah. No, I know.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.319
ljust... My head's pounding, l...

13:50.414 --> 13:53.156
I got you covered.
Two aspirin, comin' right up.

13:53.250 --> 13:54.535
Thank you.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.634
Son of a bitch.

14:10.892 --> 14:13.099

14:33.582 --> 14:34.788
Hey...

14:47.637 --> 14:49.218
Hey, man.
How are you?

14:49.389 --> 14:50.674
Sayid.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.930
Oh! Hurley.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.233
- Doc.
- How are you?

15:04.321 --> 15:05.481
All right.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.390
What the hell is she doing here?

16:01.086 --> 16:02.246
Hey.

16:03.672 --> 16:04.832
Hey.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.208
So...

16:11.179 --> 16:12.965
...you're, like, one of them, huh?

16:14.057 --> 16:15.797
l'm Juliet.

16:18.061 --> 16:20.052
I don't remember you from the dock,

16:21.439 --> 16:23.350
where you put bags on our heads,

16:24.192 --> 16:25.602
after you shocked us.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.111
I had the day off.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.915
- So, I hear you're a doctor.
- I'm really more of a researcher.

16:42.919 --> 16:44.250
Uh-huh.

16:49.593 --> 16:52.130
They send you over to keep an eye on me?

16:52.929 --> 16:54.385
OK.

16:55.432 --> 16:58.640
The last one of you guys
that came over here, Ethan...

17:01.271 --> 17:05.105
He kidnapped Claire
and Charlie got upset.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.602
We buried him over there.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.790
[flatline beeping]

17:34.763 --> 17:36.549
She's gone, Juliet.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.971
She's dead.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.600
Hey, it's OK. You tried.

17:53.198 --> 17:55.154
Why don't you go ahead and take off.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.317
I'll talk to Ben.

18:15.178 --> 18:17.715
It was Sabine's choice to get pregnant.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.895
She knew she was taking a risk.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.234
I think it happens at conception.

18:30.986 --> 18:34.069
If that's the case,
there's nothing I can do about it here.

18:34.155 --> 18:37.113
- I'm not sure I understand.
- The only way to see if I'm right

18:37.200 --> 18:39.612
is take a woman off the island,
back to Miami...

18:39.703 --> 18:42.490
No. You're not taking anybody
off the island.

18:48.086 --> 18:50.953
In that case,
there's nothing more I can do.

18:51.047 --> 18:55.711
I know you've put a lot of faith in me,
Ben, and I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.887
My sister's giving birth
in three months,

19:01.933 --> 19:04.515
and I haven't even
been able to call her.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.395
It's time for me to go home.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.613
Your sister won't be giving birth
in three months, Juliet.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.576
She'll be dead before then.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.328
Her cancer's back.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.684
- Where did you get this?
- Mikhail.

19:51.775 --> 19:54.983
I should have told you sooner.
I didn't see what good it would do.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.437
"What good it would do"?
I could have gone home, been with her!

19:58.531 --> 19:59.816
You still can.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.648
You can go home, Juliet.

20:01.743 --> 20:03.950
Be with her in her final days.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.200
Or you can stay here
and help me with our problem.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.323
Why would I stay?

20:10.418 --> 20:12.659
If you do,
I will cure your sister's cancer.

20:14.798 --> 20:18.256
- I'm supposed to take that on faith?
- You've been here six months.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.710
You've done work-ups on all of us.
Have you seen a trace of cancer?

20:21.805 --> 20:23.341
That's here!

20:23.431 --> 20:25.547
You won't let me bring my sister here...

20:25.642 --> 20:28.224
Jacob said he would
take care of it himself.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.470
Unless, of course,
you don't have faith in him.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.312
Every woman on this island needs you.

20:37.028 --> 20:42.489
If you choose to stay, I promise you,
we will save Rachel's life.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.913
- Trust her? She's one of them.
- Not anymore. They left her behind.

20:54.003 --> 20:56.415
- Where'd they go?
- I told you, I don't know.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.963
- Maybe we better ask her.
- She doesn't know.

20:59.050 --> 21:02.087
Here's a wacky idea.
Let's sic our resident lraqi on her,

21:02.178 --> 21:03.918
let him do what he does, then see.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.176
- No, I don't do that anymore.
- Ain't that convenient?

21:08.017 --> 21:09.393
But I don't trust her, Jack.

21:09.477 --> 21:12.310
If she's innocent,
why won't she answer our questions?

21:12.397 --> 21:15.184
- Give her some time. She's afraid.
- How much time?

21:15.275 --> 21:17.766
The fact that I trust her
should be enough.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.317
It's not.

21:21.865 --> 21:24.231
- Where did Locke go?
- He went with them.

21:24.325 --> 21:27.783
After he destroyed the sub
that was gonna take me off this island.

21:27.871 --> 21:30.863
- What? They were gonna let you go?
- Yeah.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.538
Said who?

21:33.501 --> 21:35.583
- Ben.
- Ben?

21:36.546 --> 21:39.788
- Whose life you saved.
- Sawyer. Lay off.

21:39.883 --> 21:42.420
- Should have let the bastard die.
- He did it for us.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.421
- Sounds like he did it for him.
- James.

21:44.512 --> 21:46.594
- Something you want to ask me?
- Yeah.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.798
Why you're fighting every one of us
and sticking up for one of them.

21:49.893 --> 21:53.226
I spent every moment over there
trying to find a way off this island.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.224
l was trying to help all of us!

21:55.857 --> 21:57.768
- Trying to get us rescued.
- Claire?

21:57.859 --> 21:59.395
Jack!

21:59.486 --> 22:01.772
Something's wrong with Claire!

22:01.863 --> 22:04.570
- [woman] Oh, my gosh.
- [man] Is she OK?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.569
All right, all right,
put her head back.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.161
- OK. OK.
- Let's get her up.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.370
- Claire?
- How long has she been like this?

22:12.457 --> 22:14.448
She started feeling bad this morning.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.999
Before we got back
was she showing any symptoms?

22:17.086 --> 22:18.792
- She was fine!
- What about water?

22:18.880 --> 22:21.496
- Has she been drinking enough water?
- I think so.

22:21.591 --> 22:23.001
Keep that head up.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.005
What happened to her?

22:27.096 --> 22:28.927
[speaking in Korean]

22:29.766 --> 22:32.098
He said, "What do you care?"

22:38.316 --> 22:41.103
Kate! I need your help.

22:41.194 --> 22:44.812
- I need you to go and get Jack.
- Well, he's busy right now.

22:44.906 --> 22:48.615
- Please, I have to talk to him.
- You wanna tell me why you need Jack?

22:50.078 --> 22:52.660
Because I think I know
what's wrong with Claire.

22:53.790 --> 22:54.996
VVhy?

22:55.708 --> 22:58.245
Because I did it to her.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.486
That givin' you
a bad feeling in your stomach?

23:34.163 --> 23:35.994
Yeah, me too.

23:36.583 --> 23:40.917
Claire's immune system is turning
on her, a reaction to medication.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.336
- Medication?
- It was designed to keep her alive

23:43.423 --> 23:46.415
- during the late stages of pregnancy.
- Designed by who?

23:47.969 --> 23:51.757
By me. For some reason,
the women here can't have babies.

23:51.848 --> 23:54.464
The mother's body
turns on the pregnancy,

23:54.559 --> 23:58.518
treats it as a foreign invader.
I saw it happen over and over.

23:58.605 --> 24:01.062
Every pregnant woman
on this island died.

24:04.485 --> 24:08.353
That is, every pregnant woman
until Claire.

24:09.699 --> 24:10.905
What did you do to her?

24:13.286 --> 24:16.778
One of our people infiltrated your camp

24:16.873 --> 24:18.909
and began taking blood samples,

24:19.000 --> 24:20.740
right after your plane crashed.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.378
- Shh.
- [sighs] Ethan.

24:26.466 --> 24:28.673
Though Claire didn't conceive
on this island,

24:28.760 --> 24:31.342
her symptoms were consistent
with previous mothers,

24:31.429 --> 24:33.920
- so we tried to save her life.
- By kidnapping her?

24:34.015 --> 24:36.301
No! That wasn't supposed to happen.

24:36.392 --> 24:38.804
She was our control case.

24:38.895 --> 24:43.764
I had developed a serum that I thought
would reverse what was happening to her.

24:43.858 --> 24:46.645
Ethan was administering the injections.

24:47.403 --> 24:50.270
But then you found out
that he wasn't on the plane.

24:50.365 --> 24:54.153
The census. I interviewed everyone.
One of them isn't in the manifest.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.780
He wasn't on the plane.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.408
So, he improvised.

25:00.583 --> 25:01.698
[Ethan] Hello, there.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.714
He kidnapped her on his own.
That was never the plan.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.843
Look, I know how this sounds,

25:14.931 --> 25:18.264
but without those injections,
Claire would have died.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.889
Without the serum,
she's going into a form of withdrawal,

25:21.979 --> 25:26.393
and if I don't treat her quickly, her
immune system could shut down entirely.

25:26.484 --> 25:30.853
Jack, I can fix this.
| just need the serum.

25:30.947 --> 25:34.610
Ethan kept medical supplies
near the caves where you used to live.

25:34.701 --> 25:38.569
If I go right now,
I can be back before it's too late.

25:45.837 --> 25:47.122
Do it.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.625
Get moving.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.462
[opera on radio]

25:56.097 --> 25:57.303
[Goodwin] Where are you?

25:59.684 --> 26:02.175
ln bed, with you.

26:05.314 --> 26:06.645
Uh-huh.

26:08.526 --> 26:10.391
Then where were you?

26:10.486 --> 26:12.317
l was just realizing

26:13.990 --> 26:17.232
that tomorrow I will have been
on this island for three years.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.657
Hmm.

26:20.663 --> 26:22.324
Well...

26:23.499 --> 26:25.205
...then I better bake a cake.

26:27.003 --> 26:28.994
[knock on door]

26:30.506 --> 26:31.757
Stay here.

26:45.146 --> 26:46.477
What've you got there?

26:48.691 --> 26:51.899
Karl developed some X-rays for me.

26:51.986 --> 26:54.318
What's wrong?

27:00.995 --> 27:02.610
Morning, Juliet.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.789
[knock on door]

27:12.215 --> 27:14.080
- Hi.
- Can I come in?

27:14.717 --> 27:16.332
Of course.

27:18.262 --> 27:19.877
l was just finishing Carrie.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.634
I don't know why you picked it,
but is it depressing.

27:22.725 --> 27:24.306
You have a tumor.

27:26.437 --> 27:28.894
- What?
- When you told me about your back pain,

27:28.981 --> 27:30.312
I said I would take X-rays

27:30.399 --> 27:33.812
to see if it was a small fracture
or a herniated disc.

27:33.903 --> 27:36.064
But that's not your problem.

27:37.198 --> 27:40.941
Your problem is a large tumor
surrounding your L-4 vertebra.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.329
You're surprised.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.335
You just told me l have cancer.
Of course I'm surprised.

27:57.426 --> 28:00.088
No, I told you that you had a tumor.

28:08.104 --> 28:10.436
- Why are you scared?
- I'm not scared.

28:10.523 --> 28:12.980
Why are you scared, Ben?

28:13.067 --> 28:15.274
You said no one on this island
ever had cancer!

28:15.361 --> 28:17.147
- You told me.
- I know what I told you.

28:17.238 --> 28:20.526
You told me you could fix it.
You said that you cured my sister.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.527
- You lied to me.
- I did not lie to you.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.701
If you can cure cancer, Ben,
then why do you have it?

28:27.874 --> 28:30.331
- I don't know.
- [glass breaking]

28:30.418 --> 28:32.784
I want to talk to her.
I want to talk to Rachel!

28:32.879 --> 28:36.212
- I want to talk to her, now!
- That's not going to happen, Juliet.

28:36.299 --> 28:38.039
I promise you that Rachel is fine.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.216
- You never cured her!
- I did!

28:40.303 --> 28:42.009
- You're a liar!
- No, Juliet!

28:42.096 --> 28:44.303
- You lied to me!
- I told you the truth!

28:46.142 --> 28:48.133
[sobbing]

28:52.064 --> 28:53.975
I gave you my word.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.563
Ben...

29:01.657 --> 29:03.739
[sobbing]

29:08.331 --> 29:10.196
I want to go home.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.249
I want to go home, Ben. Please.

29:13.336 --> 29:16.920
Can't you please just let me go home?

29:21.052 --> 29:22.292
No.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.959
[Sayid] Step away from the case.

30:03.344 --> 30:05.835
- Listen to me, Sayid...
- Step back.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.966
It's full of medical supplies.
They're for Claire.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.642
- Jack knows about it.
- Jack ain't here right now.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.728
I'm telling you the truth.

30:20.820 --> 30:24.688
You said earlier if you told me
everything you knew, I'd kill you.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.283
I'm gonna test the validity
of that statement.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.985
He means "talk".

30:31.080 --> 30:34.322
- We don't have time for this.
- We cleared our schedules.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.829
We got all the time in the world.

30:43.134 --> 30:47.753
You know it's interesting... that
you two are now the camp's moral police.

30:50.516 --> 30:54.008
I'm curious, Sayid,

30:54.103 --> 30:56.890
how long was it before you told
everyone on that beach

30:56.981 --> 31:00.064
exactly how many people
you've tortured in your life?

31:02.069 --> 31:03.900
Do they know about Basra?

31:07.408 --> 31:11.196
And I'm sure the first thing
you did when you got here, James,

31:11.287 --> 31:13.619
was to gather everyone in a circle

31:13.706 --> 31:17.870
and tell them about the man you shot
the night before you got on the plane.

31:19.045 --> 31:23.539
So why don't we just skip the part
where you two pretend to be righteous?

31:25.634 --> 31:29.593
I'm taking that medication back
to Claire, and you're gonna let me.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.638
Because if she doesn't get it,
she's gonna die.

31:35.186 --> 31:39.270
And the last thing
that either of you need right now...

31:42.943 --> 31:44.808
...is more blood on your hands.

32:00.836 --> 32:03.828
[Jâ€˜ Petula Clark: Downtown]

32:45.381 --> 32:48.373
[airplane soaring overhead]

33:00.980 --> 33:04.393
Goodwin, Ethan,
there may actually be survivors.

33:04.483 --> 33:07.270
You're one of them,
a passenger, you're in shock.

33:07.361 --> 33:09.397
Listen, learn, don't get involved.

33:09.488 --> 33:12.275
I want lists in three days. Go.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.415
So I guess I'm out of the book club.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.460
Juliet.

33:30.551 --> 33:31.916
Juliet!

33:34.597 --> 33:36.929
l was looking for you this morning.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.516
- You and I need to talk.
- Now?

33:40.603 --> 33:42.764
We have some time. It's important.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.016
Take a walk with me.

33:57.953 --> 34:00.820
- Mikhail? We're here.
- [static crackling]

34:01.207 --> 34:03.949
- He never has his walkie on.
- What are we doing here?

34:04.043 --> 34:06.284
There's something I need to show you.

34:06.837 --> 34:09.624
Mikhail? lt's Ben.

34:10.341 --> 34:13.754
I'm here with Juliet.
We're approaching the house.

34:13.844 --> 34:16.506
- Don't shoot us.
- [Mikhail] Well, hurry up then.

34:21.143 --> 34:22.508
Did you see it?

34:22.603 --> 34:26.596
A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail.
Of course we saw it.

34:27.399 --> 34:31.312
- What do you have so far?
- Oceanic Flight 815.

34:31.403 --> 34:34.019
Left Sydney, Australia,
headed for Los Angeles.

34:34.114 --> 34:36.571
324 people on board,
including the flight crew.

34:36.659 --> 34:39.071
I want detailed files
on every single passenger.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.367
Already working on it.

34:40.454 --> 34:43.571
Can we uplink to Richard
in Acadia Park, please?

34:48.504 --> 34:50.369
Yesterday you called me a liar.

34:52.049 --> 34:54.005
l was hurt by that.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.337
Hello, Richard, can you hear me?

35:03.811 --> 35:06.097
Notice today's date. This is live.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.803
OK, Richard.

to everyone's surprise,

went into complete remission.

Shortly after, she gave birth
to a healthy baby boy.

I'm not a liar, Juliet.

36:14.798 --> 36:17.255
- I want to go home.
- That's not our agreement.

36:17.343 --> 36:20.756
- You stay until your work is finished.
- It's impossible.

36:20.846 --> 36:24.634
- The mothers keep dying!
- Then we'll find more mothers.

36:25.768 --> 36:29.386
Who knows, maybe there's
even one on that plane.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.822
Wait. What are you doing?

36:47.706 --> 36:50.038
- She's not touching Claire!
- She can help her.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.377

How can you even trust her?

36:52.461 --> 36:54.326
I do trust her.

36:55.923 --> 36:57.629
Do you trust me?

36:59.093 --> 37:00.583
Do you trust me?

37:02.596 --> 37:03.836
Yeah.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.806
Just give us
a couple minutes here, OK?

37:11.688 --> 37:15.852
- How long before this takes effect?
- We should see results in a few hours.

If this doesn't work,
if something happens to her...

...l'm not gonna be able
to protect you anymore.

37:29.832 --> 37:31.914
You'll be on your own.

What happened?

38:35.063 --> 38:39.648
I've got a tarp, a couple of blankets,
airline pillows...

38:42.988 --> 38:46.105
It's not much,
but it'll get you started.

38:49.495 --> 38:51.235
Claire's awake.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.203
There's a lean-to
that we've been using for shade,

38:57.294 --> 39:01.788
and everyone says that it would be all
right if you set up camp there, for now.

39:02.925 --> 39:05.007
Thank you.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.549
They're good people.

39:07.221 --> 39:10.258
And they're willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

39:11.391 --> 39:14.474
But eventually,
they're gonna need some answers.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.679
Why don't you?

39:21.068 --> 39:23.104
You keep talking about them.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.021
Why don't I ever have to
explain myself to you?

39:30.953 --> 39:32.659
You were there.

39:34.498 --> 39:38.082
You were standing right next to me
when that submarine exploded.

39:39.086 --> 39:41.577
And in that moment,
I saw it in your eyes.

39:43.799 --> 39:47.462
You want to get off this island
more than anything else in the world.

39:51.515 --> 39:53.301
That makes you one of us.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.998
- [Ben] Let's go over it again.
- I know what to do.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.997
Let's go over it again, just to be sure.

40:23.630 --> 40:27.999
l drag Austen out into the jungle,
handcuff myself to her...

40:28.969 --> 40:31.551
...then tell her l was gassed
just like she was.

40:31.638 --> 40:34.550
- And if she catches you in the lie?
- I'll admit to it.

40:34.641 --> 40:37.178
Tell her it was the only way
to earn her trust.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.595
Good. What then?

40:43.442 --> 40:45.854
Then they'll take me back to the beach.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.357
[Juliet] I know you want me to go there,

40:55.245 --> 40:59.579
but after everything we've done to them,
it's going to be a problem.

41:04.546 --> 41:06.411
We've activated the implant in Claire.

41:06.506 --> 41:09.213
She should be symptomatic
within the next 48 hours.

41:09.301 --> 41:14.512
By the time you get to camp,
you'll have a nice big crisis to solve.

41:17.351 --> 41:20.559
- I'll need supplies.
- [Ben] Pryce is already on his way.

41:20.646 --> 41:23.558
He'll hide the case
at Ethan's old drop point.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.057
Tell Jack that you can save her.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.481
He trusts you.

41:38.705 --> 41:41.913
Are you all right?

41:45.295 --> 41:46.796
I'm fine.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.549
See you in a week.
