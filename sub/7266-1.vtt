02:35.030 --> 02:37.282
Stop.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.909
This is coming down.

02:39.910 --> 02:41.869
What? Why?

02:41.870 --> 02:45.540
No, I love the idea of the mirror
on the ceiling, but that's just ugly.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.584
But the thing is, you look beautiful in it.

02:48.585 --> 02:52.588
Now, see, if we're gonna take it down,
we gotta at least try it out...

02:52.589 --> 02:54.841
christen the new house.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.010
And what do you suggest we use
for a bed?

02:58.011 --> 03:02.974
We don't need a bed, because we got
this fine carpet right here.

03:03.475 --> 03:08.063
So I guess we'll have fine carpet
tattoos all over our asses.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.439
Wait, baby,
don't you have to go to work?

03:10.440 --> 03:13.526
I don't want any 30-second nookie.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.864
I told them I'd be late. Now what?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.574
- What about the movers?
- The movers?

03:19.575 --> 03:22.201
- Yeah.
- They're gonna be here in an hour.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.579
Which is just enough time.

03:24.788 --> 03:28.082
Derek. You are so bad.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.585
Like that isn't why you married me?

03:30.919 --> 03:33.129
What about Kyle?

03:33.130 --> 03:37.884
He'll be all right.
That boy will sleep through anything.

05:24.516 --> 05:26.184
Gage Bendix?

05:27.185 --> 05:28.728
Excuse me?

05:28.979 --> 05:31.564
I couldn't help but notice
we were both going to 22.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.817
Gage Bendix, yeah. I work there.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.945
I thought that you might.

05:39.781 --> 05:41.323
You have an appointment with us?

05:41.324 --> 05:44.827
Why, do I look like a client?

05:44.828 --> 05:45.995
Actually, you do.

05:45.996 --> 05:50.332
Well, well, I hate to shatter the illusion,
but I'm a temp.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.210
You're a temp?

05:52.586 --> 05:54.462
Girl's gotta pay the rent.

05:55.380 --> 05:58.257
I would've never guessed a temp.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.348
Let me help you out.

06:06.349 --> 06:08.601
There you go.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.901
There you go.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.989
Thanks. I owe you one.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.999
- Good morning.
- Morning.

06:35.545 --> 06:36.795
Are you following me?

06:36.796 --> 06:40.049
No, I'm taking these files
to Mr. Charles's office.

06:40.050 --> 06:42.593
- Derek Charles?
- Yeah, I guess you probably know him.

06:42.594 --> 06:44.887
Yeah, I know who he is
and he's an asshole.

06:44.888 --> 06:48.349
Takes himself way too seriously.
But don't tell him I said that, okay?

06:48.350 --> 06:50.809
- I could get you in trouble?
- Oh, yeah. Big trouble.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.645
My lips are sealed.

06:53.772 --> 06:55.147
- Patrick.
- Good morning, Derek.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.815
- Hey.
- How's the new house?

06:56.816 --> 07:00.152
Chaos, man, chaos. I got out
just as the movers showed up.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.612
Sharon must have loved that.

07:01.613 --> 07:04.073
Yeah, if she calls mad,
you tell her I'm in a meeting.

07:04.074 --> 07:06.700
Hey. Remember who used to sit
at this desk, huh?

07:06.701 --> 07:08.703
She'll know I'm lying.

07:09.704 --> 07:11.497
Can I help you?

07:11.498 --> 07:12.999
That's Derek Charles?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.667
Yes.

07:16.461 --> 07:18.671
Better watch out, girl, he's married.

07:18.672 --> 07:21.883
- The good ones are always married.
- Right. Or straight.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.678
Did you talk to our German friend,
Herr Ganz?

07:25.679 --> 07:28.013
Actually, I just got off the phone
with him.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.682
- And?
- He doesn't like the way...

07:29.683 --> 07:33.686
the stock market's gyrating, thinks
the hedge-fund wave is about to crest.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.313
- You think he's right?
- No, no. I don't think he's right.

07:36.314 --> 07:37.690
He's wrong. You know Ganz.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.234
He gets paranoid when
anything goes mainstream.

07:40.235 --> 07:41.652
So he makes a lot of noise...

07:41.653 --> 07:45.907
but I managed to talk him into
a private-equity portfolio instead.

07:46.241 --> 07:48.618
To the tune of 155 million.

07:51.121 --> 07:53.414
I want you to throw Derek
your support on this.

07:53.415 --> 07:55.583
I am just honoured
to exist in Derek's world.

07:55.584 --> 07:57.084
Whose legs are those?

07:57.085 --> 07:59.879
- Never seen them before.
- I think she's a new temp.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.780
I think you mean temptress.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.449
Always nice to have a girl
around the office, isn't it?

08:04.450 --> 08:07.494
Derek married the last eye candy
we had, took her off the market.

08:07.495 --> 08:10.706
Yes, sir. Miss us a little
Sharon around here.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.208
I don't think you do.

08:15.086 --> 08:16.878
- Patrick, forward my calls.
- Will do.

08:16.879 --> 08:19.673
- Okay. Good night, Marge.
- Bye, Derek.

08:20.383 --> 08:24.136
D, you cutting out early? I grabbed us
a couple tickets to the Lakers tonight.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.429
You're killing me. I'm moving.

08:25.430 --> 08:27.014
- I gotta get home.
- So?

08:27.015 --> 08:29.308
So do I look like a man
who wants to get a divorce?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.810
Why don't I call her and say we got
a work emergency? Come on.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.854
- No, thanks, I'll stay married.
- Coward.

08:33.855 --> 08:35.731
Yeah.

08:37.275 --> 08:38.734
Goodbye, Mr. Charles.

08:42.155 --> 08:45.032
- You punked me.
- I'm sorry, but you set me up.

08:45.033 --> 08:47.701
I'll get my revenge.
You might like to know...

08:47.702 --> 08:51.079
- that everybody disagrees with you.
- About what?

08:51.080 --> 08:53.373
About Derek Charles
being an asshole.

08:53.374 --> 08:55.292
They say he's the nicest guy
in the firm.

08:55.293 --> 08:57.169
Yeah, well, I've got them fooled.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.754
I'm Lisa, by the way.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.548
Hey, Lisa By The Way.

09:01.549 --> 09:03.759
Good luck at your next job.

09:04.427 --> 09:06.136
Hold the door, please.

09:06.137 --> 09:08.180
They're keeping me on
for a few more days...

09:08.181 --> 09:11.350
so I might see you on Monday.

09:37.835 --> 09:39.878
Sharon!

09:39.879 --> 09:41.004
Your turn.

09:41.005 --> 09:43.048
No, I think it's your turn!

09:43.049 --> 09:45.342
Don't even try it.
It's definitely your turn.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.135
Looks like I'm stuck, huh?

09:47.136 --> 09:48.845
Huh, Kyle?

09:48.846 --> 09:50.890
Come here.

09:51.099 --> 09:54.935
Oh, my God.
What is your mom feeding you?

10:33.558 --> 10:37.478
What do you think about giving
that magic mirror another test drive?

10:37.854 --> 10:40.022
Sharon, you're so bad.

10:40.023 --> 10:42.691
Like that's not why you married me.

10:47.238 --> 10:50.533
- Morning, Marge.
- Morning, Derek.

10:54.078 --> 10:56.121
Hi.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.748
Remember me?

11:01.169 --> 11:02.753
Lisa By The Way, right?

11:02.754 --> 11:05.506
Very good, I'm impressed.

11:07.342 --> 11:10.268
Hey, Marge, where's Patrick?

11:10.269 --> 11:11.553
Out with the flu.

11:11.554 --> 11:13.513
I did some trading
with the other temps...

11:13.514 --> 11:15.766
and I wrangled your desk.

11:16.726 --> 11:18.227
I hope that's okay.

11:18.770 --> 11:23.816
No, that's fine. Why don't you
grab a pad and a pen, follow me?

11:31.574 --> 11:34.201
Here's a memo
for the Christmas party this Friday.

11:34.202 --> 11:36.579
- Is it that time already?
- Yeah.

11:40.566 --> 11:42.693
Sit down.

11:47.239 --> 11:49.533
So why don't they invite spouses?

11:50.826 --> 11:52.452
What?

11:52.453 --> 11:54.746
To the party. It says no spouses.

11:54.747 --> 11:59.209
Yeah, it's Joe Gage's rule. Actually,
it's like that at a lot of companies.

11:59.210 --> 12:02.295
I guess they figure you're not gonna
kick back and let loose...

12:02.296 --> 12:05.590
if your spouse is there.
The reason of having the party, right?

12:05.591 --> 12:08.844
- So does this party get pretty wild?
- Oh, not usually.

12:08.844 --> 12:10.220
Well, that's no fun.

12:10.221 --> 12:13.599
I called Patrick. He said that
you like it black with 2 sugars.

12:15.059 --> 12:17.143
If it's cold, I can go nuke it
in the kitchen.

12:17.144 --> 12:20.271
No, actually, it's perfect. Thank you
very much. Let's get started.

12:20.272 --> 12:22.107
- Ready when you are.
- It's Monday.

12:22.108 --> 12:25.068
- First things first.
- Took care of that.

12:25.069 --> 12:26.528
Took care of what?

12:26.529 --> 12:28.780
On Mondays you always
send your wife flowers.

12:28.781 --> 12:32.117
This week you sent her a dozen
long-stemmed red roses.

12:32.118 --> 12:34.369
I called to confirm
they've been delivered.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.246
Thank you.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.709
So how long have you two
been married?

12:41.877 --> 12:43.169
3 years in March.

12:43.170 --> 12:45.755
And you still send her flowers
every week. Lucky girl.

12:45.756 --> 12:48.675
Yeah, it's kind of a tradition.

12:48.676 --> 12:52.137
Patrick said that you started back
when she was your assistant.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.222
You and Patrick had quite
a conversation.

12:54.223 --> 12:55.890
- Let's run some calls.
- Fire away.

12:55.891 --> 12:57.976
Why don't we start
with Phil Trendle?

12:57.977 --> 13:00.270
See if you can get a lunch
appointment next week...

13:00.271 --> 13:02.856
but push for The Water Grill.
I like the fish.

13:02.857 --> 13:05.150
- The Water Grill's fantastic.
- Terry Mills.

13:05.151 --> 13:08.362
- Am I going too fast?
- I'm just waiting on you.

13:09.363 --> 13:11.239
Are you always this efficient?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.866
Does that surprise you?

13:12.867 --> 13:15.326
Yeah. Yeah, most of the temps
we get here, they're like--

13:15.327 --> 13:18.205
I think you'll find
I'm not your typical temp.

13:21.042 --> 13:22.326
<i>We were at the grocery store,</i>

13:22.427 --> 13:25.962
I look over and Kyle is flirting
with the checkout girl.

13:25.963 --> 13:29.674
<i>She's about 16, and he's 2.</i>

13:29.675 --> 13:33.511
<i>He was giving her the same look
you give when you see a pretty girl.</i>

13:33.512 --> 13:37.474
<i>I think you've been teaching my baby
how to flirt. Like father, like son.</i>

13:37.850 --> 13:40.935
<i>So, anyway, on the way home,
I stopped by campus today...</i>

13:40.936 --> 13:45.106
<i>and I picked up a catalogue
for next semester's curriculum.</i>

13:45.107 --> 13:47.734
<i>Let me tell you, I cannot wait.</i>

13:48.110 --> 13:49.736
Do you need me?

13:50.237 --> 13:54.407
<i>I'm gonna show it to you tonight.
I need your opinion on my courses.</i>

13:54.408 --> 13:56.243
Are you listening to me?

14:03.584 --> 14:05.668
Baby.

14:05.669 --> 14:08.922
If I bundle Managerial Economics
and Operations Management...

14:08.923 --> 14:11.424
then I won't take Management
Information Systems...

14:11.425 --> 14:13.760
until next semester, right?

14:13.761 --> 14:14.886
School?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.846
- Derek.
- It's like an online degree?

14:16.847 --> 14:19.808
Come on, baby, not tonight.
You know this is important to me.

14:19.809 --> 14:21.393
Well, it's important to me too...

14:21.394 --> 14:25.397
but I was kind of hoping you liked
being a mom, staying home with Kyle.

14:25.398 --> 14:28.191
You know I love being a mom.

14:28.901 --> 14:32.612
We got all this room. I make
enough money for you and I to--

14:32.613 --> 14:34.572
It's not about the money.

14:34.573 --> 14:35.740
We had an agreement.

14:35.741 --> 14:39.327
You said that you'd work hard, I'd have
the baby, you'd get your promotion.

14:39.328 --> 14:40.412
Then I'd get my degree.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.080
- I said that?
- Yes, you did.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.666
You have something to talk about
when you get home.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.334
I need some things to talk about.

14:46.335 --> 14:49.421
- So Kyle's gonna be an only child?
- Let's get him a puppy.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.198
A female that looks
like your side of the family...

14:52.199 --> 14:55.284
- and tell him it's his sister.
- Can we call her Little Sharon?

14:55.285 --> 14:56.744
Hey, Little Sharon. Come here.

14:56.745 --> 14:59.580
You know exactly
who I'm talking about.

14:59.581 --> 15:04.210
You know what, I wanna see you
say that in front of her face.

15:07.089 --> 15:10.174
D? Why didn't you
call me back today?

15:10.175 --> 15:12.343
- What time did you call?
- Around 4.

15:12.344 --> 15:15.764
- You should leave a message.
- I did leave a message.

15:16.473 --> 15:19.100
Oh, Patrick was sick,
and, you know, the temp--

15:19.101 --> 15:20.977
We had a temp and she said...

15:20.978 --> 15:23.563
Shannon called but didn't leave a number.

15:23.564 --> 15:27.150
She? I thought we had an agreement,
no female assistants.

15:27.151 --> 15:29.861
Baby, I don't control
temp availability.

15:29.862 --> 15:31.404
Is she pretty?

15:31.405 --> 15:33.489
Pretty plain.

15:33.490 --> 15:36.784
Actually, you know what,
she did a better job than Patrick.

15:36.785 --> 15:38.494
Except for messing up
your message.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.913
- I want her fired immediately.
-lmmediately.

15:40.914 --> 15:43.500
- I'm serious.
- I promise.

15:46.128 --> 15:48.797
Good night, Shannon.

15:53.427 --> 15:55.344
Hope we're not interrupting
anything.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.638
No, no, it's a treat to have you here.

15:57.639 --> 16:00.683
I'm taking Kyle to The Grove today
to see Santa.

16:00.684 --> 16:04.228
You wanna come?
Get your picture taken on Santa's lap?

16:04.229 --> 16:06.063
No, I would, but I'm swamped.

16:06.064 --> 16:08.149
You need me back in the office,
don't you?

16:08.150 --> 16:10.735
Excuse me.
Here's your coffee, freshly nuked.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.488
Hey, Lisa.

16:13.489 --> 16:17.825
This is my wife, Sharon. Sharon,
this is Lisa. She's temping for Patrick.

16:17.826 --> 16:20.536
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mrs. Charles.

16:20.537 --> 16:23.456
- Hi.
- Hi. And this must be Kyle.

16:23.707 --> 16:26.417
I can already tell
he's gonna be a heartbreaker.

16:26.418 --> 16:29.045
Hi, Kyle. I'm Lisa.

16:29.046 --> 16:30.338
Say hi, Kyle.

16:30.339 --> 16:33.841
Oh, he can say hello. He's usually
not this shy around strangers.

16:33.842 --> 16:37.304
What a handsome boy.
He looks just like you.

16:37.471 --> 16:38.972
You think so?

16:39.056 --> 16:41.766
Most people think he looks
like the beautiful Sharon.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.434
Talk about the perfect family.

16:43.435 --> 16:46.187
The 3 of you should be
on the cover of a magazine.

16:46.188 --> 16:48.773
It's a good thing you won't be here
too long.

16:48.774 --> 16:51.025
I know my husband
can be very demanding.

16:51.026 --> 16:53.444
Actually, I'm learning a lot
from your husband.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.031
I bet you are.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.868
Joe Gage needs to see you
when you have a moment.

17:00.869 --> 17:02.454
Great.

17:02.621 --> 17:04.997
It's nice to meet you, Sharon.

17:04.998 --> 17:06.458
You too, Liz.

17:06.708 --> 17:08.501
- It's Lisa.
- Excuse me?

17:08.502 --> 17:10.586
It's Lisa. You said Liz.

17:10.587 --> 17:13.923
Sorry. Lisa.

17:17.469 --> 17:21.638
- Sharon.
- Wasn't me. Blame Shannon.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.808
- What's the deal with her?
- What do you mean?

17:23.809 --> 17:25.644
" Looks just like you, Derek."

17:26.353 --> 17:28.396
But he is kind of handsome like me.

17:28.396 --> 17:29.814
You said she was plain.

17:29.815 --> 17:32.066
That girl may be a lot,
but she ain't plain.

17:32.067 --> 17:35.361
I wouldn't know.
I only have eyes for you.

17:35.362 --> 17:37.864
And you really think
that's gonna work?

17:37.865 --> 17:39.574
Come on.

17:39.575 --> 17:41.909
Take you around the office.
You can see the gang.

17:41.910 --> 17:43.578
I know that you must miss it.

17:43.579 --> 17:46.665
- When is Patrick coming back?
- Tomorrow.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.250
You better hope so.

18:39.635 --> 18:41.720
Crudo.

19:02.407 --> 19:05.034
Wow, look at the tree.

19:05.035 --> 19:07.287
Christmas already.

19:09.331 --> 19:11.374
- Hey, Stan.
- Good morning, Mr. Charles.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.709
- I'm back.
- Patrick.

19:13.710 --> 19:15.545
- Feeling better?
- Yeah, thanks.

19:15.546 --> 19:18.464
You know it's gonna take a lot more
than some stomach bug...

19:18.465 --> 19:20.591
to keep me away from
that Christmas party.

19:20.592 --> 19:21.634
Yeah.

19:21.635 --> 19:25.388
Not sure we can say the same
for Marge.

19:27.415 --> 19:29.125
You get around, don't you?

19:30.585 --> 19:33.462
Poor girl called in sick
with the stomach bug.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.880
She caught it from Patrick.

19:34.881 --> 19:37.383
That's what she gets
for using my lip gloss.

19:38.718 --> 19:41.888
All right, girls.
Behave yourselves out here.

19:44.724 --> 19:48.769
So how many times did you get busted
listening in on Derek's calls?

19:48.770 --> 19:50.688
As if you don't.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.690
I'm way too smooth
to ever get caught.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.150
- I bet you are.
- How long have you been here?

19:55.151 --> 19:57.361
- 10 years in April.
- I bet you know more...

19:57.362 --> 19:59.947
about what happens behind
these doors than anybody.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.991
Sweetie, you have no idea.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.410
My nickname around here is 411.

20:04.411 --> 20:07.872
411. Well, maybe we can grab
a cocktail after work sometime.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.623
You can catch me up with girl talk.

20:09.624 --> 20:13.377
If you think you can pump me for
information with a couple of Cosmos...

20:13.378 --> 20:15.296
you're right.

20:33.064 --> 20:36.901
I'm sorry, I thought everyone
was at lunch.

20:38.069 --> 20:40.154
- I should go.
- No.

20:40.488 --> 20:42.114
You stay. Okay?

20:42.115 --> 20:46.952
I'm gonna just grab my lunch and...

20:46.953 --> 20:49.497
head on back to my office.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.125
Okay?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.885
- You okay? You wanna talk about it?
- It's nothing.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.804
Nothing?

21:05.722 --> 21:11.018
You know, most people I know
don't cry over nothing.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.354
You think I'm crying?

21:13.396 --> 21:15.105
This is just allergies.

21:15.106 --> 21:17.900
Oh, allergies, okay.
What are you allergic to?

21:20.028 --> 21:22.613
Men, apparently.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.657
Can I sit down?

21:26.201 --> 21:28.286
Yeah.

21:30.163 --> 21:34.208
You having boyfriend troubles
right now?

21:35.627 --> 21:38.838
I'm beginning to think
there's something wrong with me.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.716
There's nothing wrong with you.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.552
I wish I could believe that.

21:49.599 --> 21:52.477
Maybe you haven't met
the right guy yet.

21:53.019 --> 21:55.396
I'm beginning to think
all the good ones are taken.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.107
I'm no expert, but, you know,
if it didn't work out...

21:58.108 --> 22:00.985
then maybe it wasn't meant to be.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.820
Maybe.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.906
And then, you know,
you're gonna meet the right guy...

22:05.907 --> 22:07.491
you'll know immediately.

22:07.492 --> 22:09.786
Is that how it was
with you and Sharon?

22:10.328 --> 22:12.705
Yeah. Yeah, it does happen.

22:12.706 --> 22:16.459
- Great. Now I'm jealous.
- Why?

22:16.918 --> 22:18.878
She has everything.

22:18.879 --> 22:22.006
Perfect husband, perfect child,
perfect marriage.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.050
No. No, nothing's perfect.

22:25.051 --> 22:27.636
You know, there are problems
in every relationship.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.680
The most important thing
is to move forward.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.183
You gotta keep moving forward,
you know?

22:32.976 --> 22:36.020
Hey, Lisa, look, don't beat yourself up
over this guy.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.507
Look at you, you're a bright,
attractive woman.

22:39.716 --> 22:42.467
Any man would be lucky
to have you.

22:42.468 --> 22:43.802
Yeah, right.

22:43.803 --> 22:47.181
No. Honestly, if I were single....

22:47.432 --> 22:49.266
You're just trying
to make me feel better.

22:49.267 --> 22:50.976
Is it working?

22:51.561 --> 22:53.854
Yes.

22:54.188 --> 22:55.772
Good.

22:55.773 --> 22:57.858
You hang in there, okay?

22:58.151 --> 23:01.904
It's gonna be just fine.

23:01.905 --> 23:03.822
Thanks, Derek.

23:03.823 --> 23:07.660
Mister--  Mr. Charles.

23:11.873 --> 23:13.999
I'm sorry, excuse me.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.877
- Excuse me.
- That's all right.

23:18.671 --> 23:20.339
What was that all about?

23:20.340 --> 23:23.508
Oh, man, her boyfriend dumped her
and I was being nice.

23:23.509 --> 23:26.678
I'll take up that slack.
That is one smoking hot piece of ass.

23:26.679 --> 23:28.889
- Stop it, Ben.
- Come on. Like you haven't noticed.

23:28.890 --> 23:30.933
No, dude,
I'm not in the game anymore.

23:30.934 --> 23:33.227
I'm retired and coaching, as are you.

23:33.228 --> 23:36.855
I'm still in the game. I'm just
on the bench, waiting to play again.

23:36.856 --> 23:38.774
Careful, D.
It's not like the old days...

23:38.775 --> 23:42.236
where you could get away with
office nookie and not get nailed for it.

23:42.237 --> 23:43.403
Careful, D?

23:43.404 --> 23:45.405
You went and married yours,
that's all.

23:45.406 --> 23:47.115
If you're thinking of that girl--

23:47.116 --> 23:49.034
- You saw her first.
- You are a fool.

23:49.035 --> 23:53.080
Sadly, I don't think I'm her type.
Now, you, on the other hand....

23:54.165 --> 23:56.166
All I'm saying
is that these single gals...

23:56.167 --> 23:58.460
see the workplace
as their hunting ground.

23:58.461 --> 24:02.882
And I think this one has got you
in her cross hairs.

25:13.620 --> 25:16.455
Sharon. Hey.

25:18.124 --> 25:20.876
I just put him to sleep, baby.

25:23.004 --> 25:24.254
Red? Blue?

25:24.255 --> 25:25.798
- Red? Blue?
- The red one.

25:29.928 --> 25:34.640
- What you doing tonight?
- The usual. Formula, oatmeal.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.267
How do I look?

25:37.268 --> 25:39.519
- You look all right.
- I look all right.

25:39.520 --> 25:43.232
Remember the last time you went
to that party and got drunk.

25:44.550 --> 25:46.217
Kyle.

25:46.218 --> 25:48.053
Eat something.

25:48.054 --> 25:51.139
I will. I'm gonna grab a burger
at Jake's.

25:51.140 --> 25:54.935
- Okay. I love you.
- Okay. I love you too.

25:55.728 --> 26:00.899
4th quarter, Derek Charles
puts it up, 3 seconds to go.

26:02.777 --> 26:06.697
- I love you, baby.
- Bye. Eat something, baby.

26:35.518 --> 26:37.602
- This seat taken?
- Yeah.

26:37.603 --> 26:39.104
No, I'm kidding.

26:39.105 --> 26:41.106
Be my guest.

26:44.276 --> 26:46.778
- Look at you.
- It's a Christmas party.

26:46.821 --> 26:48.363
Oh, yeah. You look great.

26:48.364 --> 26:51.241
Thank you.
You grabbing a bite before?

26:51.242 --> 26:52.575
Yeah. You too?

26:52.576 --> 26:54.160
Brilliant minds think alike.

26:54.161 --> 26:57.038
Thank you, John.
Still the best burger in town.

26:57.039 --> 26:58.749
Really?

26:59.000 --> 27:01.001
Hey, John? John?

27:01.502 --> 27:03.169
John.

27:03.170 --> 27:06.757
- Can I have one too?
- Fix her up. The special.

27:13.180 --> 27:15.348
- That was delicious.
- I told you.

27:15.349 --> 27:20.061
You know, we used to come back here
after a hard day's work and cut loose.

27:20.062 --> 27:21.396
- Work hard, play hard?
- Yeah.

27:21.397 --> 27:24.817
Back in the day,
I would throw them back too.

27:25.318 --> 27:27.611
Hey, how's your boyfriend trouble?

27:27.820 --> 27:30.697
- Keep moving forward, right?
- Exactly.

27:30.698 --> 27:34.743
- All right.
- So, what's the grand plan, Derek?

27:34.744 --> 27:36.828
Run the company by 35...

27:36.829 --> 27:41.166
jet by 40, retire on my private island
and own the Lakers by 50.

27:41.167 --> 27:43.501
- I'm a Sixers fan.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

27:43.502 --> 27:46.171
I'll bring you around to my team,
okay?

27:47.048 --> 27:48.757
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

27:48.758 --> 27:51.217
Can--? Can I please have
a dirty martini?

27:51.218 --> 27:52.427
Sure.

27:52.428 --> 27:54.763
- You want one?
- No, thanks.

27:55.473 --> 27:58.099
Oh, come on. Big talker.

27:58.100 --> 27:59.225
No, thanks.

27:59.226 --> 28:03.355
- It's Christmas time. Work's dead.
- John, no.

28:04.023 --> 28:06.692
- Bring one for my friend.
- How dirty do you want it?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.694
Make it filthy.

28:11.947 --> 28:14.324
This is for you.

28:20.831 --> 28:23.249
Patrick? Patrick. Patrick.

28:23.650 --> 28:26.861
Once again, great job as the head
of the decoration committee.

28:26.862 --> 28:31.616
- You're like Santa's Little Helper.
- Well, I wouldn't let your people do it.

28:32.159 --> 28:35.912
Hey, don't try this at home, huh?
You'll hurt yourself.

28:43.212 --> 28:44.545
What's up?

28:44.546 --> 28:46.506
What's going on?
You look beautiful.

28:47.549 --> 28:49.426
I'll be right back.

28:49.635 --> 28:51.386
I'm coming for you, Derek.

28:52.638 --> 28:54.806
- I'm coming for you.
- No. I don't dance.

28:54.807 --> 28:57.600
No, come on, you don't wanna
with me. Okay, okay.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.603
Yeah. All right.

29:00.813 --> 29:03.272
- Is this you, Marge?
- That's me.

29:03.273 --> 29:05.984
Let me get some of that boogie.

29:06.860 --> 29:10.279
- Didn't know you could move like that.
- Because I'm stuck behind a desk.

29:10.280 --> 29:14.492
- Okay, you do have legs under there.
- Oh, yes, I do.

29:18.122 --> 29:21.082
- All right. You are smooth.
- Smooth, baby, real smooth.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.792
- Really smooth.
- I'm coming in.

29:22.793 --> 29:25.670
All righty, baby. He's all yours.

29:27.131 --> 29:30.466
- Hey, Office Asshole.
- That's Mr. Office Asshole to you.

29:30.467 --> 29:31.968
Tequila?

29:31.969 --> 29:36.013
Beer, 3 martinis, and tequila?
No, I don't think so.

29:36.014 --> 29:37.974
Coward.

29:44.565 --> 29:46.524
Bring it on.

29:46.525 --> 29:48.651
You've got the moves.

29:48.652 --> 29:51.029
That's Soul Train for you, baby.

29:51.030 --> 29:52.947
- What you got?
- Wanna see what I got?

29:52.948 --> 29:55.534
- Let's go, let's go.
- Bring it.

29:56.618 --> 29:58.911
You got some moves. Okay, temp.

29:58.912 --> 30:01.873
- Nasty, nasty.
- Hey.

30:02.332 --> 30:04.292
You know,
I wasn't gonna come tonight.

30:04.293 --> 30:06.127
Why not?

30:06.128 --> 30:09.756
I haven't been here that long and....

30:09.757 --> 30:13.552
I'm sure everybody here is happy
that you showed up.

30:14.928 --> 30:16.345
Even you?

30:16.346 --> 30:20.225
What do you mean, "even me"?
I'm your biggest supporter here.

30:27.649 --> 30:29.901
You wanna put one on the cheek?

30:32.905 --> 30:36.575
If you don't, people will
really think something's going on.

30:38.243 --> 30:41.788
Well, we're gonna have
to take that chance then, huh?

30:44.583 --> 30:45.958
Whoa, where you going?

30:45.959 --> 30:49.420
This evening's just getting started.
Sally Sloane. We got Sally Sloane.

30:49.421 --> 30:51.381
You remember her?
She gave us lap dances!

30:51.382 --> 30:53.091
- Sally.
- Derek has singles!

30:53.092 --> 30:55.885
- He has singles!
- I gotta go home, sober up.

30:55.886 --> 30:57.970
You wanna get out of here and go
find yourself some new trouble?

30:57.971 --> 31:01.265
- No, thank you. No, thank you.
- Where is your holiday spirit?

31:01.266 --> 31:03.101
With my wife and kid.

31:03.102 --> 31:06.646
Gotta take a leak, then I'm sneaking
out of here, all right?

31:06.647 --> 31:09.941
You're no fun, D. No fun at all.

31:18.701 --> 31:20.034
Lisa, Lisa.

31:20.035 --> 31:23.996
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop.

31:23.997 --> 31:25.874
Come on, stop, no.

31:29.878 --> 31:31.630
Fuck.

31:38.387 --> 31:40.722
You need to stop it.

31:43.851 --> 31:46.061
Who's there?

31:47.021 --> 31:50.565
Stop. Okay. Okay.

31:52.968 --> 31:54.844
Lisa, Lisa.

31:54.845 --> 31:59.182
Oh, God, Lisa, Lisa. Stop. Stop.
Don't do that. Don't....

32:02.978 --> 32:04.729
Stop, stop.

32:14.072 --> 32:16.407
Lisa, stop.

32:17.284 --> 32:19.160
Stop.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.668
Stop.

32:27.669 --> 32:29.587
Stop it.

32:31.173 --> 32:34.091
- What? Derek.
- What the hell is wrong with you?

32:34.092 --> 32:37.428
What's wrong? Derek!

32:44.853 --> 32:48.230
If you don't feel like you can drive,
I have cab vouchers.

32:48.231 --> 32:51.358
Cab vouchers for anybody
who can't drive. Don't want you hurt.

32:51.359 --> 32:53.653
Come on, don't be shy.

33:00.035 --> 33:02.161
Freak.

33:05.916 --> 33:10.169
Well, well, well.
Living dangerously, aren't we?

33:10.170 --> 33:12.839
Patrick, you silly old queen.

33:13.381 --> 33:15.216
Dance with me.

33:16.510 --> 33:18.469
Dance with me.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.050
How was it?

34:40.677 --> 34:42.887
The usual, baby.

34:43.013 --> 34:45.598
Anything interesting happen?

34:47.641 --> 34:49.686
No.

35:07.454 --> 35:08.996
Good morning.

35:08.997 --> 35:10.915
Hey. Morning.

35:12.108 --> 35:13.901
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

35:13.902 --> 35:16.278
Man, you should've stayed.

35:16.279 --> 35:19.281
Roger from Acquisitions tossed
his cookies on the Christmas tree.

35:19.282 --> 35:21.075
Sorry I missed that.

35:29.542 --> 35:31.669
Bad time?

35:32.837 --> 35:35.047
No.

35:35.048 --> 35:38.509
Joe wants to know when you'll
be done with the Ganz portfolio.

35:40.884 --> 35:43.302
Sure.

35:47.224 --> 35:50.852
Joe really likes the ladies, huh?

35:52.429 --> 35:55.373
I-I wouldn't know.

36:10.930 --> 36:13.015
Hey. All right if I take off?

36:13.016 --> 36:15.934
- Yeah. Go home.
- All right. See you tomorrow.

36:15.935 --> 36:17.728
Okay.

36:17.729 --> 36:19.522
Hey, Lisa.

36:56.768 --> 36:58.895
Hey.

37:00.897 --> 37:04.233
I owe you an apology
for the Christmas party.

37:04.526 --> 37:08.570
I think that I sort of took you
by surprise.

37:08.571 --> 37:13.325
Yeah, you know,
we both had a few drinks.

37:13.326 --> 37:15.286
So let's just forget about it.

37:16.621 --> 37:18.456
What if I can't?

37:26.756 --> 37:29.091
Lisa, nothing happened.

37:29.884 --> 37:35.139
All right, have it your way.
Nothing happened.

37:37.809 --> 37:39.644
All right, get out of my car.

37:40.395 --> 37:42.188
Get out of my car right now.

37:43.815 --> 37:45.650
Get out of my car.

37:45.900 --> 37:47.234
Relax.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.987
- Derek, relax.
- Come on. Out of my car.

37:50.030 --> 37:52.698
- Get out of here.
- No one's around to see us.

37:53.033 --> 37:56.827
God. I almost went insane today.
Having to pretend...

37:56.828 --> 37:59.955
like I was concentrating on work,
when all I could think about--

37:59.956 --> 38:02.666
Lisa! Get out of my car now!

38:02.667 --> 38:05.253
Derek, what's wrong?

38:05.378 --> 38:07.838
- What did I do?
- Hey, hey.

38:07.839 --> 38:10.591
I don't know what's wrong,
whether you're dense or what...

38:10.592 --> 38:13.802
but let me tell you something.
There's nothing going on between us.

38:13.803 --> 38:17.389
Nothing! Okay? I wouldn't jeopardise
my job. For chrissakes, I work here.

38:17.390 --> 38:19.683
Stop! Don't touch me. Just get out.

38:19.684 --> 38:21.435
Get out.

38:21.461 --> 38:23.295
Get out.

38:23.755 --> 38:27.674
- Get out! Come on!
- God!

38:27.675 --> 38:31.428
- Maybe you are an asshole.
- Yeah, all right. Get out.

39:02.794 --> 39:04.962
Sharon?

39:05.838 --> 39:07.506
Shar?

39:09.884 --> 39:12.386
Something I need to tell you.

39:18.267 --> 39:19.434
What's wrong?

39:19.435 --> 39:22.646
I spent the last hour and a half
talking my sister off the ledge.

39:22.647 --> 39:24.731
- Sheila?
- Can you believe Tim's been having...

39:24.732 --> 39:28.736
an affair with some random woman
at work for a year and a half?

39:28.945 --> 39:32.155
- How did she find out?
- Tim just blurted it out.

39:32.156 --> 39:35.492
He said he was leaving her.
With 3 kids.

39:35.618 --> 39:38.829
- Yeah, that's tough.
- It's a disaster. If it were me--

39:38.830 --> 39:42.124
No, that would never be you,
because I would never cheat on you.

39:42.375 --> 39:44.084
I know.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.172
Tim is an asshole.

39:48.172 --> 39:50.341
Tell me about it.

39:53.344 --> 39:56.096
So, what were you gonna tell me?

39:56.097 --> 39:57.556
What?

39:57.557 --> 40:00.267
You said you had something
to tell me. What is it?

40:01.477 --> 40:03.479
No.

40:04.188 --> 40:08.234
Just a problem at work.
Nothing I can't handle.

40:09.652 --> 40:12.112
Why didn't you tell me?

40:12.488 --> 40:14.573
Honestly, there was nothing to tell.

40:14.574 --> 40:17.743
She grabbed your package,
flashed you in your car.

40:17.744 --> 40:19.661
Come on.
I thought we were best friends.

40:19.662 --> 40:21.997
I cannot believe
you didn't tell me sooner.

40:21.998 --> 40:24.458
- Ben, you think this is funny?
- Yes, I do.

40:24.459 --> 40:27.711
I kind of thought maybe she was
into you a little. I just never figured--

40:27.712 --> 40:30.505
I don't get it. You know, I....

40:30.506 --> 40:32.382
Honestly, Ben.

40:32.383 --> 40:35.302
" Hey, how are you?" I didn't--
I was just being nice.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.179
That's all.

40:37.180 --> 40:39.598
You sure you didn't lead her on?
Just a little?

40:39.599 --> 40:43.561
- No. Not a goddamn thing. Honestly.
- That girl is hot.

40:43.978 --> 40:47.273
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Report it to Human Resources.

40:47.398 --> 40:49.149
You're gonna get her fired?

40:50.026 --> 40:52.778
- I don't have a choice.
- Let's just be careful about this.

40:52.779 --> 40:55.113
What if she says
that you came onto her?

40:55.114 --> 40:56.323
No way.

40:56.324 --> 40:58.909
We're talking history
of behaviour here, Derek.

40:58.910 --> 41:02.079
When's the last time you had
a female assistant at your desk, huh?

41:02.080 --> 41:03.706
People are gonna wonder.

41:15.343 --> 41:17.010
- Morning, Mr. Charles.
- Hey.

41:17.011 --> 41:18.512
- Hank back there?
- Go right in.

41:18.513 --> 41:21.056
- Hey, Hank.
- Derek, hey.

41:21.057 --> 41:23.809
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

41:26.896 --> 41:32.025
I have.... I have a personal matter
I gotta talk to you about.

41:32.026 --> 41:33.944
You know Lisa Sheridan, the temp?

41:33.945 --> 41:36.613
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She worked your desk for a while.

41:36.614 --> 41:39.658
Yeah, that's right. She did.

41:40.618 --> 41:43.370
Hank, this is awkward, okay?

41:43.371 --> 41:46.123
If you're here to file a complaint
about her performance...

41:46.124 --> 41:47.541
you can save your breath.

41:47.542 --> 41:50.043
Her agency called,
said she's not coming back in.

41:50.044 --> 41:52.087
They already sent a replacement.

41:53.072 --> 41:55.324
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

41:57.243 --> 41:58.827
They say why?

42:00.079 --> 42:01.747
No.

42:02.665 --> 42:05.792
Why, was there some sort
of problem?

42:05.793 --> 42:07.252
Problem?

42:07.253 --> 42:11.590
No. No problem. No problem.

42:14.593 --> 42:17.512
I just thought she was way in
over her head, that's all.

42:17.555 --> 42:20.974
- But if she already quit, then....
- She beat you to it.

42:20.975 --> 42:22.559
Yeah.

42:26.063 --> 42:28.398
Yeah.

42:30.943 --> 42:33.695
- Was there anything else?
- No. Guess not.

42:33.696 --> 42:36.239
- How's the new house?
- You know, couldn't be better.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.907
- Tell Sharon I said hi.
- I will.

42:37.908 --> 42:40.910
Actually, you guys should come by
once we settle down. Come by.

42:40.911 --> 42:42.620
- That sounds great.
- All right.

42:42.621 --> 42:44.873
- See you, Hank.
- Bye-bye.

42:49.503 --> 42:51.463
- So?
- She quit.

42:51.464 --> 42:52.839
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

42:52.840 --> 42:54.507
Do you have a horseshoe
up your ass?

42:54.508 --> 42:56.676
You are the luckiest bastard I know.

42:56.677 --> 42:57.886
Looks that way.

42:57.887 --> 42:59.929
Not a bad early Christmas present.

42:59.930 --> 43:02.224
All right.

43:27.124 --> 43:28.208
Thank you.

43:28.209 --> 43:31.044
Thank you. I'm getting
all these gifts. Look at this.

43:36.675 --> 43:38.218
Friedrich?

43:38.594 --> 43:40.929
Hey, it's Derek Charles.

43:40.930 --> 43:45.017
Hey. How was your Christmas?

43:45.518 --> 43:50.230
No, mine was great.
I had a great time with my family.

43:50.231 --> 43:53.650
No, I'm in the office working
for you right now.

43:53.651 --> 43:55.985
Absolutely. That's what we do.
That's what we do.

43:55.986 --> 43:59.031
Hey, you take a look
at that prospectus for me?

44:01.075 --> 44:03.452
I told you.

44:03.869 --> 44:05.412
I told you.

44:05.955 --> 44:10.167
<i>Yeah. No, I think we're gonna
have a great New Year.</i>

44:17.883 --> 44:19.968
Baby, it's after 3?

44:19.969 --> 44:23.680
That's the last time I'm celebrating out
on New Years.

44:23.681 --> 44:28.936
Next year, we'll celebrate at home.
Just you, me, and Kyle.

44:34.150 --> 44:36.234
Aren't you gonna get that?

44:36.235 --> 44:38.319
No. It'll wait till the morning.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.656
What if it's Ganz with the approval?

44:41.098 --> 44:44.559
It's noon in Munich. Go on, lazy.

44:54.236 --> 44:56.070
Ganz?

44:56.071 --> 44:57.572
No.

45:15.716 --> 45:17.258
What was that?

45:17.259 --> 45:21.930
Nothing. I just gotta get a
new spam blocker.

46:07.726 --> 46:08.976
And then Joe was like:

46:08.977 --> 46:13.064
"Oh, we're not drinking. This is a
retreat. We're gonna stay sober.

46:13.065 --> 46:14.857
Do some bonding."

46:14.858 --> 46:17.735
If Joe said that, he must've
been drunk at the time.

46:17.736 --> 46:20.863
Right? So I'll call you later
and check on you and Kyle.

46:20.864 --> 46:22.365
Okay.

46:26.662 --> 46:30.289
Whoa, whoa, whoa, lap dance. Lap
dance. Who brought up lap dance?

46:30.290 --> 46:33.835
This is--  This is a business retreat.
This is work.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.754
We are clocked in.
Unless it was Joe's idea.

46:36.755 --> 46:39.257
Well, it's a brilliant idea,
so it must've been mine.

46:39.258 --> 46:42.134
All righty. Well, then,
let's see a show of hands...

46:42.135 --> 46:45.638
of who wants to see
some hot, oily breasts...

46:45.639 --> 46:48.516
being jammed into their faces?
Derek, are you in?

46:48.517 --> 46:49.892
I'm a married man.

46:49.893 --> 46:51.894
- I don't have to pay for it.
- You're paying.

46:51.895 --> 46:53.813
- You just don't know it yet.
- Hear, hear.

46:53.814 --> 46:56.315
- Excuse me, sir.
- What's this?

46:56.316 --> 46:57.525
A dirty martini.

46:57.526 --> 47:01.029
- No, I didn't....
- It's from the lady at the bar.

47:01.613 --> 47:05.116
<i>I do have to say I'm kind of a fan
of the waitress staff around here.</i>

47:04.681 --> 47:06.353
<i>We should hit one of those clubs.</i>

47:06.561 --> 47:08.392
Derek, are you okay?

47:08.601 --> 47:11.274
Yeah. Yeah, I just thought
I saw somebody I know.

47:11.481 --> 47:14.791
Somebody you know,
or somebody you'd like to know?

47:15.001 --> 47:16.195
He can't be tempted.

47:16.401 --> 47:17.993
Can't blame him.
Too scared of Sharon.

47:18.201 --> 47:22.114
Speaking of Sharon, I said
I'd call her. I'll be right back.

47:24.561 --> 47:27.121
Hey. Hey, babe.

47:27.321 --> 47:29.516
<i>How's the male bonding?</i>

47:29.721 --> 47:31.916
As you can guess, everybody's wasted.

47:32.881 --> 47:36.157
In about half an hour, I'll be able....

47:36.961 --> 47:38.633
<i>Derek, are you there?</i>

47:38.841 --> 47:41.594
<i>Wait, I think Kyle wants
to say good night.</i>

47:41.801 --> 47:43.757
<i>Derek, are you still there?</i>

47:43.961 --> 47:46.794
- Babe, I gotta call you right back.
- It'll just take a second.

47:47.001 --> 47:49.754
- Say good night to Daddy.
- They're calling for me to come back.

47:49.961 --> 47:52.873
- Honey, I'm gonna call you right back.
- Derek?

47:53.881 --> 47:54.870
Derek?

47:55.081 --> 47:56.230
Was that Sharon?

47:56.441 --> 47:58.796
I can always tell from
the pained look on your face...

47:59.001 --> 48:00.878
when you've been talking to her.

48:02.201 --> 48:03.759
How did you know I'd be here?

48:03.961 --> 48:06.316
What's wrong? You don't look happy
to see me.

48:06.521 --> 48:08.716
I'm not happy to see you.

48:08.921 --> 48:09.956
What are you doing here?

48:10.161 --> 48:12.675
You said that you would
never jeopardise your job.

48:14.881 --> 48:16.951
That's why I quit,
so that we could be together.

48:17.161 --> 48:18.674
You misunderstood me.

48:18.881 --> 48:24.001
I'm married, happily married.
There will never be us...

48:24.201 --> 48:26.351
together, ever.

48:26.561 --> 48:29.633
You're worried what Joe and Ben
might think.

48:29.841 --> 48:31.274
I'll tell you what they'll think.

48:31.481 --> 48:34.154
They'll think that we arranged it
and we did.

48:35.521 --> 48:37.113
What are you talking about?

48:38.601 --> 48:40.239
I see what you're doing.

48:40.441 --> 48:44.116
One of us has to take charge,
and I guess that's gonna be me.

48:44.321 --> 48:48.917
So you go back and you say your
good nights to the boys, and...

48:49.121 --> 48:50.793
I'll be waiting in my room, 610.

48:51.001 --> 48:52.229
I'm not coming to your room.

48:52.441 --> 48:55.114
- You want me to come to yours?
- You're sick.

48:55.681 --> 48:58.320
- You need help.
- I know.

48:59.601 --> 49:00.875
Help me, Derek.

49:01.641 --> 49:03.393
You stay away from me.

49:08.081 --> 49:09.309
- Sharon?
- Sharon?

49:09.521 --> 49:11.796
It's Ben.
Dude, you done for the night?

49:12.001 --> 49:14.435
No. I'm coming back.

49:18.361 --> 49:19.760
Hey, come on, D, it's early.

49:19.961 --> 49:22.429
Let's hit my room, plunder the minibar,
charge it to Joe.

49:22.641 --> 49:27.715
No, I, I can't. That last drink
totally kicked my ass, man.

49:27.921 --> 49:31.436
All right, drunky. Don't forget,
9 a.m. tomorrow, Tiffany Room.

49:31.641 --> 49:33.757
Joe's big rah-rah to the troops.

49:33.961 --> 49:36.475
Yeah, 9 a.m.

49:36.681 --> 49:38.478
Lightweight.

50:18.121 --> 50:19.076
Out.

50:20.601 --> 50:21.795
Baby.

50:24.521 --> 50:26.000
No.

50:31.841 --> 50:34.196
Does that feel good?

50:34.401 --> 50:35.993
No.

50:45.961 --> 50:47.440
Hush, baby.

51:01.401 --> 51:03.835
No, please, stop.

51:11.801 --> 51:13.598
Does that feel good?

51:28.961 --> 51:30.633
Housekeeping.

51:30.841 --> 51:32.638
- Sharon?
- Oh, sorry.

51:35.681 --> 51:37.751
Oh, God.

51:45.481 --> 51:47.039
Oh, shit.

51:49.641 --> 51:51.233
Of course,
we here at Gage Bendix...

51:51.441 --> 51:53.671
have a couple advantages
over the competition...

51:53.881 --> 51:56.998
not the least of which is the fact
that we are privately held.

51:57.201 --> 52:00.830
We don't worry about the transparency
required of public companies.

52:01.041 --> 52:03.601
Thank God, I was thinking
of sending out a search party.

52:03.801 --> 52:06.156
I'm sorry. I overslept.

52:06.361 --> 52:07.714
You overslept.

52:07.921 --> 52:10.389
The second great advantage
is that most of our clients...

52:10.601 --> 52:12.796
are high-net-worth individuals
more concerned...

52:13.001 --> 52:17.358
with preservation of capital than in
outsized gains in any single year....

52:17.561 --> 52:19.199
You all know
how to read a bar chart.

52:19.401 --> 52:22.393
What is important here
is putting your clients at ease.

52:22.601 --> 52:25.638
One of the things I suggest
going forward in this difficult time...

52:25.841 --> 52:28.401
the credit crunch,
whatever you want to call it...

52:28.601 --> 52:30.796
is that they understand
that America is on sale.

52:31.001 --> 52:33.037
Excuse me, sir, your wife is here.

52:36.961 --> 52:38.917
- It's Sharon.
- What about her?

52:39.121 --> 52:40.315
She's here.

52:40.521 --> 52:41.510
Excuse me, Joe.

52:44.161 --> 52:48.040
At any rate, I want to make sure that
you can go with confidence and say....

53:03.641 --> 53:05.632
Here's your wife, sir.

53:07.001 --> 53:09.754
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you woke up. I went to the spa.

53:09.961 --> 53:11.076
What are you doing?

53:11.321 --> 53:12.993
I thought you'd need an excuse
to get out of there.

53:13.201 --> 53:14.634
- You wanna get some lunch?
- Lunch?

53:14.841 --> 53:17.196
Yeah, it's gorgeous outside.
I made a reservation--

53:17.401 --> 53:19.039
Hey.

53:19.241 --> 53:21.038
What do you think this is?

53:21.241 --> 53:23.072
The morning after.

53:23.761 --> 53:25.433
We didn't do anything last night.

53:26.681 --> 53:28.194
You don't remember?

53:28.401 --> 53:31.279
- Last night was perfect.
- Nothing happened!

53:31.481 --> 53:34.154
Baby, not so loud.
It'll cause a scene.

53:34.361 --> 53:35.555
A scene?

53:35.761 --> 53:37.991
Right. That's exactly what we need.

53:38.201 --> 53:40.431
- What are you doing?
- I wanna give you a scene.

53:40.641 --> 53:43.599
I'll take you into Joe and the rest
so you can tell them all that--

53:43.801 --> 53:45.837
- Why ruin this?
- There is no "this."

53:46.041 --> 53:47.554
Don't say that.

53:47.761 --> 53:49.274
Goddamn it, come here.

53:54.921 --> 53:56.320
What's wrong with you?

53:57.721 --> 53:59.313
Why are you acting like a stranger?

53:59.521 --> 54:03.594
That is exactly what I am to you, a
stranger, somebody you do not know.

54:04.281 --> 54:05.794
Now either you go in there...

54:06.001 --> 54:09.038
and you tell them your lies,
or you leave me the hell alone.

54:11.481 --> 54:13.676
Don't you put this all on me, Derek.

54:13.881 --> 54:16.873
We both knew what we were getting
into from the very beginning.

54:17.081 --> 54:18.116
What?

54:18.321 --> 54:19.993
The first time we met in the elevator.

54:21.161 --> 54:22.276
Our dirty martini.

54:23.881 --> 54:24.950
The Christmas party.

54:25.561 --> 54:28.871
You said that you wished you were
single so that we could be together.

54:29.081 --> 54:30.309
No. No, I did not.

54:30.521 --> 54:32.193
- You did! You said it!
- No! I did not!

54:36.861 --> 54:39.978
If I go in that room and tell them,
it'll be the truth.

54:41.021 --> 54:42.295
Is that what you want?

54:43.061 --> 54:45.973
You want me to tell them the truth?

54:49.101 --> 54:51.251
Ready when you are.

54:51.621 --> 54:53.612
Hey, hey.

54:54.541 --> 54:55.496
Listen to me!

54:57.141 --> 54:58.620
What are you doing?

54:58.821 --> 55:02.450
Hit me. You can do
anything you want to me.

55:05.221 --> 55:06.449
You know what?

55:06.981 --> 55:10.769
It doesn't matter what you do or what
you say or what goes on in that brain...

55:10.981 --> 55:14.769
because there's never gonna be
anything between us, never.

55:14.981 --> 55:16.209
Okay, Lisa?

55:16.421 --> 55:18.013
Derek.

55:23.221 --> 55:24.700
Derek?

55:27.221 --> 55:28.734
Derek?

55:39.501 --> 55:40.934
I realise we went a little long.

55:41.141 --> 55:44.178
I thought some of the questions you
raised were worth going over...

55:44.381 --> 55:46.133
and I apologise for the length of it.

55:46.341 --> 55:49.936
Those of you with tee times, and I
have one myself, we will still make....

55:50.141 --> 55:51.859
Everything okay?

56:03.621 --> 56:05.577
- Top you off.
- Thank you.

56:06.661 --> 56:08.379
- D?
- Oh, no, no, thanks.

56:08.581 --> 56:09.775
You're not drinking?

56:09.981 --> 56:13.018
No, not this evening, man.
I'm sticking to the iced tea.

56:15.461 --> 56:16.860
That's a first.

56:18.821 --> 56:20.652
- You feeling all right?
- Yeah.

56:20.901 --> 56:22.380
He's just growing up.

56:23.301 --> 56:24.893
Man.

56:41.541 --> 56:45.739
No goddamn way. Come on.
No. Hey. Hey, get up.

56:46.461 --> 56:48.372
Hey. Lisa.

56:48.581 --> 56:50.651
Come on, get up, get up.
You can't stay here.

56:50.861 --> 56:53.329
Come on. I'll drag you out of here.
Let's--

56:56.901 --> 56:58.459
No. No, no, no.

57:03.621 --> 57:06.579
I need a paramedic up here at 583.
I have a woman in the room.

57:06.781 --> 57:09.341
I think she's overdosed on some sort
of prescription pills.

57:09.541 --> 57:11.099
Yeah, yeah. Hurry! Now, please!

57:11.301 --> 57:12.780
Okay.

57:14.941 --> 57:17.011
Breathe. Breathe.

57:17.221 --> 57:18.370
Bitch, breathe.

57:26.301 --> 57:28.861
- Derek. What's going on?
- I'll call you.

57:46.101 --> 57:47.056
Hello?

57:47.261 --> 57:48.853
Hi, Ben. It's Sharon.

57:49.061 --> 57:50.733
Hi, Sharon, hi.

57:50.941 --> 57:52.533
I'm sorry to disturb you.

57:52.741 --> 57:55.494
I was trying to reach Derek,
and he usually calls me by now.

57:55.701 --> 57:57.498
I can't reach him on his cell phone.

57:57.701 --> 57:59.817
I was hoping he might be with you?

58:03.781 --> 58:07.569
Yeah, there-- There was
a kind of incident.

58:07.781 --> 58:09.260
Is he all right?

58:11.861 --> 58:13.135
Ben?

58:13.341 --> 58:16.378
I think he should tell you himself.

58:17.621 --> 58:20.772
Ben, you're scaring me now.
Where is he?

58:26.421 --> 58:28.059
Excuse me. Is she okay?

58:28.261 --> 58:30.729
The doctors are still working on her.

58:31.741 --> 58:36.053
Derek. Oh, my God. I've been worried
out of my mind. Are you okay?

58:36.261 --> 58:39.412
What are you doing here? It's okay,
it's okay. I'm good, I'm good.

58:39.621 --> 58:41.293
- Where's Kyle?
- Julie is watching him.

58:41.501 --> 58:42.570
- What happened?
- Sharon.

58:42.781 --> 58:44.453
Mr. Charles. How you doing?

58:44.661 --> 58:47.255
My name is Monica Reese.
I'm the investigating detective.

58:47.461 --> 58:49.736
- Detective?
- Yeah. This is my wife, Sharon.

58:49.941 --> 58:52.375
- She just got here.
- So you haven't told her?

58:52.581 --> 58:54.617
- What?
- Would you prefer to talk in private?

58:54.821 --> 58:59.099
- In private? What's happening, Derek?
- It's okay. Please, we can talk.

58:59.301 --> 59:02.498
I've gone over the initial statement
you gave to the police on the scene.

59:02.701 --> 59:04.931
I just need to clarify a few things,
okay?

59:05.141 --> 59:06.620
Let's sit down.

59:10.501 --> 59:15.211
Detective Reese, 0300 hours,
January 15th.

59:17.221 --> 59:20.372
This young woman, Lisa Sheridan,
she works in your office?

59:20.581 --> 59:22.458
Lisa the temp?
What happened to her?

59:22.661 --> 59:24.014
Yeah, she tried to hurt herself.

59:24.221 --> 59:25.973
Why? What? Well, what did she do?

59:26.181 --> 59:28.058
Mrs. Charles, I'm sorry.

59:28.261 --> 59:30.855
I need to get the story
in your husband's own words.

59:31.061 --> 59:32.130
Apparently, so do I.

59:33.381 --> 59:35.417
Mr. Charles, this Lisa Sheridan--

59:35.621 --> 59:37.896
Yeah, she worked with us
2 weeks.

59:38.101 --> 59:40.057
What, you've only known her
for 2 weeks?

59:40.261 --> 59:41.296
Approximately 2 weeks.

59:41.501 --> 59:44.698
Long enough for her to fantasize
that you two were having an affair?

59:44.901 --> 59:47.461
- What?
- No. No.

59:47.661 --> 59:50.539
She came on to me
at the Christmas party...

59:50.741 --> 59:54.859
and then in the parking garage.

59:55.061 --> 59:56.858
And then she showed up
at the retreat...

59:57.541 --> 59:59.179
at my hotel, and I rejected her.

59:59.381 --> 01:00:02.293
And when--  Excuse me.
And when you rejected her...

01:00:02.501 --> 01:00:05.891
she tried to commit suicide, naked,
in your bed, in your hotel room.

01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:09.696
Wait, wait, wait. She was naked
in your bed, Derek?

01:00:09.901 --> 01:00:12.290
- Mrs. Charles.
- She was naked in your hotel room?

01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:13.490
Please.

01:00:13.701 --> 01:00:16.295
- Would you say this affair was--
- There was no affair.

01:00:16.501 --> 01:00:17.934
There was no affair.

01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:21.178
You're saying she made the thing up
in her head with no help from you?

01:00:21.381 --> 01:00:23.099
That is exactly what I'm saying.

01:00:23.301 --> 01:00:25.337
Why do you think she'd pick you?

01:00:25.541 --> 01:00:29.329
I don't know. Maybe I said something
that she took the wrong way.

01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:31.179
- Baby, come on.
- Like what? Like what?

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:34.100
What exactly did you say
that she took the wrong way, Derek?

01:00:34.301 --> 01:00:37.657
- I'm gonna have to ask you to le--
- No, no, she's not going anywhere.

01:00:37.861 --> 01:00:41.217
I didn't say anything to her.
I did not lead her on.

01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:43.139
You had no idea she'd be
at the hotel?

01:00:43.341 --> 01:00:44.854
I don't know how she got
in my room.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:48.690
She told the hotel clerk she was your
wife and she wanted to surprise you.

01:00:48.901 --> 01:00:50.812
- I have nothing to say to you.
- Stop, Sharon.

01:00:51.021 --> 01:00:53.933
- Did you have sex with her?
- No, I did not...

01:00:54.141 --> 01:00:55.574
have sex with her.

01:00:56.981 --> 01:00:59.893
Sharon, come on. I need for you and I
not to fall apart right now.

01:01:00.101 --> 01:01:02.296
- Mr. Charles. Please.
- Hold on.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.772
Just stay here.
Please just stay here.

01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:14.056
Look, I don't care if you're doing
this girl or not.

01:01:14.261 --> 01:01:17.059
I'm not doing this girl, okay?
Never have.

01:01:17.261 --> 01:01:19.092
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:01:20.821 --> 01:01:21.810
Detective?

01:01:22.021 --> 01:01:24.137
It's the doctor. I'll be right back.

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:26.450
Sharon.

01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:29.175
I swear to God
this is just a misunderstanding.

01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:30.609
A misunderstanding.

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:34.530
A girl tries to kill herself because of
you, it's just a misunderstanding?

01:01:34.741 --> 01:01:36.174
You think I'm gonna believe that?

01:01:36.381 --> 01:01:38.292
- Do you believe me?
- No, I don't believe you!

01:01:38.501 --> 01:01:41.061
- You didn't even call your son back--
- Sharon, listen.

01:01:41.261 --> 01:01:43.331
Seems they pumped her out in time.

01:01:43.541 --> 01:01:45.816
Probably tomorrow they'll take her
out of the lCU...

01:01:46.021 --> 01:01:49.411
and take her up to the 5th floor
for psychiatric evaluation.

01:01:49.621 --> 01:01:51.896
That's great news. Okay, thank you.

01:01:52.101 --> 01:01:55.889
She was lucid enough to give a name
to the doctor in case of emergencies.

01:02:03.461 --> 01:02:05.292
You still wanna stick to your story?

01:03:00.101 --> 01:03:02.569
Sharon. Sharon,
you gonna talk to me?

01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:05.375
Thanks, Julie. I'll call you tomorrow.

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:06.775
Sharon, is everything okay?

01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:09.051
Julie. Hey, thank you.

01:03:09.261 --> 01:03:10.740
Sharon.

01:03:13.341 --> 01:03:14.660
Sharon.

01:03:15.341 --> 01:03:17.059
Hey.

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:18.614
Sharon.

01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:21.015
Can we talk?

01:03:22.221 --> 01:03:25.019
Sharon, I just-- Now listen,
Sharon, all I wanna do--

01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:28.054
What, what, what, Derek? What?
What do you want?

01:03:28.261 --> 01:03:30.297
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Now you wanna talk.

01:03:30.501 --> 01:03:33.334
- Sharon, you know me.
- No, I don't know you.

01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:36.214
I don't know you. I know the Derek
that told me everything.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:38.935
- Oh, come on.
- But you? I have no idea who you are.

01:03:39.141 --> 01:03:40.096
Sharon, I was wrong.

01:03:40.301 --> 01:03:42.656
If I hadn't gone to the ER,
if I hadn't called Ben...

01:03:42.861 --> 01:03:44.374
would you have even told me?

01:03:44.581 --> 01:03:46.458
What are you, crazy?
Of course I would have.

01:03:46.661 --> 01:03:48.731
Like you told me about
the Christmas party, huh?

01:03:48.941 --> 01:03:50.454
Or what about the parking garage?

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:53.971
Yes, you told me about you being
in a parking garage with this woman.

01:03:54.181 --> 01:03:55.773
What else haven't you told me,
Derek?

01:03:55.981 --> 01:03:57.972
All I'm hearing
are things you haven't told me.

01:03:58.181 --> 01:04:00.570
I was wrong. I should've told you
the truth from the--

01:04:00.781 --> 01:04:02.373
You should have! Why didn't you?

01:04:02.581 --> 01:04:05.300
Because I didn't think
it was a big deal in the first place...

01:04:05.501 --> 01:04:06.775
...and then I was embarrassed.

01:04:06.981 --> 01:04:10.769
- How do I say it without looking--?
- Guilty? Guilty?

01:04:10.981 --> 01:04:15.020
I'm your wife, Derek. You're supposed
to trust me. You let this happen.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.255
You think I encouraged this?

01:04:17.461 --> 01:04:21.534
Don't give me that innocent bullshit.
I was there at your desk. I saw you.

01:04:21.741 --> 01:04:24.301
I saw how you played games
and you played those girls...

01:04:24.501 --> 01:04:27.379
but you never did that to me.
Until now.

01:04:29.061 --> 01:04:31.450
What is this? Is this about me
wanting to go to school?

01:04:31.661 --> 01:04:33.174
God, Sharon, it is not like that.

01:04:33.381 --> 01:04:35.770
This woman is sick, okay?
Nothing happened between--

01:04:35.981 --> 01:04:38.620
Do I ever ask you for anything?
I don't ask you for anything.

01:04:38.821 --> 01:04:40.334
All I asked you was to be honest.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:41.735
- I told you the truth!
- No.

01:04:41.941 --> 01:04:43.260
- I did.
- No, you didn't.

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:47.613
- I told you the truth.
- No, you didn't. You lied.

01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:49.891
We made a vow
on our wedding day...

01:04:50.101 --> 01:04:52.535
that we would tell each other
everything.

01:04:53.061 --> 01:04:56.212
No matter how ugly
or uncomfortable it might be.

01:04:58.661 --> 01:05:01.573
I specifically asked you,
"Did anything happen at that party?"

01:05:01.781 --> 01:05:03.180
And what did you tell me?

01:05:03.381 --> 01:05:05.053
- You said no.
- I know.

01:05:05.261 --> 01:05:07.252
- I don't know what to believe right now.
- Okay.

01:05:07.461 --> 01:05:08.416
Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:08.621 --> 01:05:11.089
I think I need to be alone.
I think I need to be alone.

01:05:11.301 --> 01:05:13.292
Stop, stop, stop. Okay?

01:05:13.501 --> 01:05:15.492
Come on. Sharon. Please?

01:05:16.221 --> 01:05:18.451
- Sharon, come on.
- Get out of my house!

01:05:18.661 --> 01:05:21.494
This is crazy, Sharon!
Don't you see what's happening?

01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:23.259
Get out of my house.

01:05:30.501 --> 01:05:32.378
Nothing happened with this....

01:05:34.821 --> 01:05:36.379
Okay. You know what?

01:05:36.581 --> 01:05:40.051
You just tell me what you want me
to do and that's what I'll do!

01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:42.616
Well, first, I suggest you pack
your toothbrush.

01:05:42.821 --> 01:05:45.858
Then I want you to get your socks,
your shaving kit, your underwear...

01:05:46.061 --> 01:05:48.370
your prophylactics, if
you need them, and get out!

01:05:48.581 --> 01:05:50.617
- And go where, Sharon?
- To hell.

01:05:51.421 --> 01:05:54.458
But until then,
I suggest maybe the Four Seasons.

01:05:59.381 --> 01:06:00.894
Sharon!

01:06:15.301 --> 01:06:16.529
Miss Sheridan?

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:20.613
Hey, I'm Monica Reese.
I'm a detective assigned to your case.

01:06:21.061 --> 01:06:22.733
- Come in.
- Thanks.

01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:26.690
I'm sorry I'm such a mess.

01:06:26.901 --> 01:06:30.211
They won't let me take a shower
or wash my hair.

01:06:30.421 --> 01:06:33.060
Apparently I'm still on suicide watch.

01:06:35.221 --> 01:06:38.452
So you feel like talking
about the other night?

01:06:39.781 --> 01:06:41.009
Have you spoken to Derek?

01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:42.449
Yeah.

01:06:42.981 --> 01:06:44.460
And he's all right?

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:46.857
Relatively speaking.

01:06:47.061 --> 01:06:48.619
When can I see him?

01:06:48.821 --> 01:06:51.415
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna be possible.

01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:54.294
- Why?
- Miss, I don't mean to upset you...

01:06:54.501 --> 01:06:57.334
but I don't think Mr. Charles
wants to speak to you...

01:06:57.541 --> 01:07:00.658
or continue any kind of contact.

01:07:01.541 --> 01:07:03.372
Then why did he send me these?

01:07:06.821 --> 01:07:08.379
He sent you flowers?

01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:11.893
Lilies. My favourite.

01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:13.056
Beautiful.

01:07:17.781 --> 01:07:19.260
Yeah.

01:07:22.101 --> 01:07:25.537
Miss Sheridan, could you tell me
what happened at the hotel?

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:27.697
- Why you were there?
- Didn't Derek tell you?

01:07:27.901 --> 01:07:31.337
Yeah, but I'd really like
to get your version.

01:07:32.221 --> 01:07:34.371
Well, there's not much to tell.

01:07:35.421 --> 01:07:38.299
He asked me to meet him
at the hotel.

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:39.980
And you agreed?

01:07:40.421 --> 01:07:41.979
Of course.

01:07:42.181 --> 01:07:43.534
And then what happened?

01:07:44.341 --> 01:07:46.855
I think you can guess what we did.

01:07:47.541 --> 01:07:49.497
Yeah. You.... You slept together.

01:07:49.701 --> 01:07:50.929
Yes.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:53.614
Well, Derek denies it, so....

01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:57.651
He's just trying to protect me.

01:07:58.581 --> 01:07:59.730
He's being a gentleman.

01:08:00.421 --> 01:08:01.536
Right.

01:08:01.741 --> 01:08:07.099
The next day, he told me that his wife
wouldn't give him a divorce.

01:08:07.301 --> 01:08:09.417
You know the kind of woman
that will never let go?

01:08:09.621 --> 01:08:11.259
Yeah.

01:08:11.461 --> 01:08:13.656
Then he said
that we couldn't see each other.

01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:16.219
I overreacted.

01:08:16.901 --> 01:08:19.973
I didn't realise at the time
that he was just being noble.

01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:23.573
Noble? What do you mean, "noble"?

01:08:23.781 --> 01:08:26.978
He was thinking about his little boy,
Kyle.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.171
What the break-up would do to him.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:33.609
Lisa. Can I call you Lisa?

01:08:34.261 --> 01:08:35.694
Yeah.

01:08:35.901 --> 01:08:37.970
How would you, you know...

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.651
characterise your relationship
with Derek?

01:08:42.341 --> 01:08:44.377
- Lovers.
- Yeah, I got that.

01:08:44.581 --> 01:08:48.698
But I mean, do you really believe
he's in love with you?

01:08:48.901 --> 01:08:50.778
I'm not a home wrecker.

01:08:52.581 --> 01:08:56.368
Monica, I'm not stealing him away.
Their marriage is over.

01:08:59.621 --> 01:09:02.693
I do feel bad about his wife, though.

01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.493
Well, how so?

01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:06.134
Well, it can't be easy...

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:09.810
to find out that your husband's
in love with someone else.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.738
Right.

01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.095
I just hope that she doesn't do
something stupid.

01:09:17.701 --> 01:09:20.055
I don't have to tell you the impact
this could have.

01:09:20.261 --> 01:09:23.252
- Even a whiff of impropriety.
- Impropriety. There is no impropriety!

01:09:23.461 --> 01:09:26.214
This is just a sick fantasy
from a very disturbed girl.

01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:28.854
Who might retaliate
with a sexual harassment lawsuit.

01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.858
I was the one
who was sexually harassed.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:34.133
I can't believe this is happening
to me. This is like a nightmare.

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.457
By now you're probably wishing
you had banged her.

01:09:36.661 --> 01:09:38.537
Goddamn it, Joe!

01:09:39.901 --> 01:09:43.450
Derek, calm down. I believe you,
and I'll back you all the way on this.

01:09:43.661 --> 01:09:45.652
If we find out
there was something going on....

01:09:45.861 --> 01:09:47.852
That's not gonna happen.
There's nothing.

01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:50.939
Good. Then you've got nothing
to worry about.

01:09:51.541 --> 01:09:55.136
- I'm putting Ben on the Ganz account.
- No. Ganz is my client--

01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:56.296
- Look--
- No, Joe.

01:09:56.501 --> 01:09:58.014
I'm not losing my client over this.

01:09:58.221 --> 01:10:01.896
Take a little time off, just until
this blows over. Focus on Sharon.

01:10:02.101 --> 01:10:03.375
Oh, Jesus.

01:10:04.661 --> 01:10:05.980
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:10:06.181 --> 01:10:08.695
Derek, there's a Detective Reese here
to see you.

01:10:10.141 --> 01:10:12.530
Come on.
You think I sent her flowers?

01:10:12.741 --> 01:10:16.814
My assistant has all my personal
information in his computer.

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:20.214
She must have accessed them
when she temped for me.

01:10:22.501 --> 01:10:26.653
This is Lisa's journal.
It's a sort of diary, I guess...

01:10:26.861 --> 01:10:28.579
- that she was keeping.
- Okay.

01:10:28.781 --> 01:10:31.090
It's a rather graphic
and detailed account...

01:10:31.301 --> 01:10:34.816
of your various sexual liaisons
together.

01:10:35.021 --> 01:10:37.694
- My what?
- I have to warn you, it's....

01:10:43.141 --> 01:10:44.540
"We...."

01:10:51.541 --> 01:10:53.179
This is bullshit.

01:10:53.701 --> 01:10:56.215
None of this happened.
I've never been to her apartment.

01:10:56.421 --> 01:10:57.934
I've never touched her.

01:10:58.141 --> 01:11:01.895
Well, according to these entries,
you are quite the accomplished lover.

01:11:02.101 --> 01:11:05.537
Oh, and apparently,
you made some promises to her.

01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:07.333
Promises to divorce your wife and--

01:11:07.541 --> 01:11:09.771
Okay, detective.

01:11:09.981 --> 01:11:11.653
You seem smart.

01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:13.894
You can't possibly believe that.

01:11:14.101 --> 01:11:17.491
Look, the only thing that matters
is that she believes this.

01:11:17.701 --> 01:11:21.091
So there has to be something I can do
to protect myself, right? My family?

01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:23.610
Sure.
You could file a restraining order.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:24.890
Let's do that.

01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:26.978
- But that might not be necessary.
- Why not?

01:11:27.181 --> 01:11:29.490
Because Lisa's sister flew down
from San Francisco...

01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:32.454
and took Lisa back with her
earlier today.

01:11:36.781 --> 01:11:38.692
I can't say I'm unhappy to hear that.

01:11:39.861 --> 01:11:42.375
Maybe now she'll get the help
that she needs.

01:13:23.781 --> 01:13:26.420
You ready? Let's go for it.

01:13:27.221 --> 01:13:30.930
- Hey.
- Kyle. Hey, baby.

01:13:48.141 --> 01:13:50.257
It's my birthday next week.

01:13:51.621 --> 01:13:53.100
Happy birthday.

01:13:59.781 --> 01:14:01.737
Have dinner with me?

01:14:04.381 --> 01:14:05.973
Come on, Sharon.

01:14:08.461 --> 01:14:10.292
Move your foot, Derek.

01:14:39.421 --> 01:14:40.615
What do you think?

01:14:41.861 --> 01:14:43.089
Be honest.

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:50.696
Derek, your menu. Your menu.

01:14:50.901 --> 01:14:53.369
- Oh, my menu, I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

01:14:58.541 --> 01:15:00.452
Sharon, this means a lot to me.

01:15:02.181 --> 01:15:03.296
I missed you.

01:15:03.501 --> 01:15:07.050
And, I don't know, there's just so much
I wanna tell you.

01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:09.417
It's your party, birthday boy.

01:15:14.901 --> 01:15:15.890
You look beautiful.

01:15:17.501 --> 01:15:18.854
I love you.

01:15:20.421 --> 01:15:22.412
Sharon, I just wanna be home.

01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:24.493
Okay, it's been 3 months.

01:15:24.701 --> 01:15:29.729
And I'll do whatever it takes to fix this,
to make us work again...

01:15:29.941 --> 01:15:32.899
your studies, you and Kyle,
I mean...

01:15:33.101 --> 01:15:35.490
you name it, I'll do it.

01:15:43.981 --> 01:15:45.494
I got you something.

01:15:48.181 --> 01:15:49.819
- Should I just--?
- No.

01:15:51.141 --> 01:15:53.609
Let's see how
the rest of the evening goes.

01:15:54.621 --> 01:15:57.294
And welcome to "Fact or Fiction. "

01:15:57.501 --> 01:15:59.969
I'm your host, Rod Baker.

01:16:00.261 --> 01:16:04.812
And on today's show, let's welcome
back our champion, Bunny!

01:16:20.301 --> 01:16:22.451
Hi. I'm Sharon's friend, Kate.

01:16:23.301 --> 01:16:24.290
You're...?

01:16:24.861 --> 01:16:27.773
Samantha. Mrs. Charles is at dinner.

01:16:27.981 --> 01:16:30.654
Sharon told me to drop by.
I have this present for Kyle.

01:16:30.861 --> 01:16:32.214
I'm just gonna run it up to him.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:33.820
Oh, you can't, he's sleeping.

01:16:34.021 --> 01:16:34.976
I won't wake him.

01:16:35.181 --> 01:16:36.933
Maybe you should come back
another time.

01:16:37.141 --> 01:16:38.733
But I'm here now.

01:16:38.941 --> 01:16:40.420
I....

01:16:41.101 --> 01:16:44.218
I get it, you're just doing your job.
Good.

01:16:44.421 --> 01:16:46.412
Do you need me to call Sharon?

01:16:46.901 --> 01:16:48.016
Yeah.

01:16:48.221 --> 01:16:49.973
Okay.

01:16:57.461 --> 01:16:59.929
Sharon. Hey, it's Kate.

01:17:00.781 --> 01:17:04.137
Where am I? I'm at your house,
of course. You told me to drop by.

01:17:04.741 --> 01:17:05.730
She forgot.

01:17:07.101 --> 01:17:09.137
No, Samantha just wanted me
to give you a call.

01:17:09.341 --> 01:17:10.774
She was a little bit concerned.

01:17:10.981 --> 01:17:14.940
No. No, no, no.
Don't be upset with her.

01:17:15.141 --> 01:17:18.133
No, God, come on,
she was just doing her job.

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:22.218
Great. All right, have an
amazing dinner. Tell Derek I said hi.

01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:23.774
Oh, Sharon, hold on.

01:17:23.981 --> 01:17:25.380
Do you need to talk to her?

01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:27.094
No, no, I'm fine.

01:17:27.741 --> 01:17:30.938
All right, I'll catch up with you
in the morning. Bye, honey.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.334
I'll be back in a sec.

01:17:34.181 --> 01:17:35.170
Yeah.

01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:56.895
Sharon, you know,
I miss you and I love you...

01:17:57.101 --> 01:17:59.171
and I know that you miss me too.

01:18:01.821 --> 01:18:05.177
I do miss you, but I don't know
if that's enough.

01:18:11.981 --> 01:18:13.653
We're not talking about divorce,
right?

01:18:13.861 --> 01:18:16.375
I don't come from a family of divorce.

01:18:16.581 --> 01:18:19.732
Mom and Dad'll be celebrating their
30th anniversary in 3 months.

01:18:20.581 --> 01:18:22.776
I look at them and I wonder
if that can ever be us.

01:18:22.981 --> 01:18:26.132
It is us. It can be us, will be us.

01:18:38.221 --> 01:18:41.213
I need you to understand
that nothing happened with that girl.

01:18:41.421 --> 01:18:45.858
I know I should've been honest
with you from the beginning...

01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:47.653
and I wasn't.

01:18:48.821 --> 01:18:51.096
And that will never happen again.

01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:53.179
But I love you.

01:18:53.381 --> 01:18:57.340
I mean, I love you with all my heart,
and I love my son too.

01:19:03.501 --> 01:19:05.139
I guess Kyle does miss his daddy.

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:08.856
Does Sharon...miss Daddy?

01:19:10.301 --> 01:19:13.020
I will do anything, anything.

01:19:13.821 --> 01:19:16.051
- Anything?
- You name it.

01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:22.099
Oh, I guess the evening's
going good.

01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:27.299
What about the Benz?

01:19:28.661 --> 01:19:30.697
- The Benz.
- My Benz?

01:19:30.901 --> 01:19:34.132
I just-- Oh, yes.
I got that key right here.

01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:36.899
You know, it's....

01:19:41.301 --> 01:19:42.290
Missed you.

01:19:57.461 --> 01:19:58.689
See you later!

01:19:58.901 --> 01:20:00.175
You too!

01:20:14.821 --> 01:20:16.174
Okay, it works, it works.

01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:18.656
Welcome home, baby.

01:20:19.661 --> 01:20:20.810
You driving my car.

01:20:21.021 --> 01:20:23.694
- You guys got back so fast.
- Hey.

01:20:23.901 --> 01:20:24.936
Any trouble with Kyle?

01:20:25.141 --> 01:20:27.735
No, he was a doll.
But you just missed your friend.

01:20:27.941 --> 01:20:30.011
- What friend?
- You know, your friend Kate?

01:20:30.221 --> 01:20:31.176
I don't know a Kate.

01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:33.133
She was here.
She had something for Kyle.

01:20:33.341 --> 01:20:34.774
Oh, my God! Where's Kyle?

01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:36.778
- His crib.
- Somebody was inside the house?

01:20:36.981 --> 01:20:38.494
- Yeah.
- How long were they here for?

01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:42.296
Just a few minutes. What's wrong?
You said it was okay!

01:20:42.501 --> 01:20:43.695
Kyle?

01:20:45.181 --> 01:20:46.296
She took my baby.

01:20:46.501 --> 01:20:48.537
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:20:49.981 --> 01:20:51.096
What happened? Tell me.

01:20:51.301 --> 01:20:53.656
She said she had something for Kyle
and then she left.

01:20:53.861 --> 01:20:55.897
She left? Kyle's not in his room!

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:57.932
Call 911! Now!

01:20:58.901 --> 01:21:00.493
Kyle?

01:21:08.261 --> 01:21:10.252
Kyle?

01:21:10.461 --> 01:21:13.897
Kyle? Son?

01:21:17.381 --> 01:21:19.053
Kyle!

01:21:24.741 --> 01:21:27.050
Oh, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.

01:21:30.941 --> 01:21:32.499
Kyle, oh.

01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:38.337
She couldn't have got far.
She couldn't have got far.

01:21:50.021 --> 01:21:52.296
We'll wait for the blood work.
It appears he's fine.

01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:54.731
I don't see any reason
why you can't take him home.

01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:56.852
- Thank you, doctor.
- Thank you.

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:01.614
Hey.

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.654
How's he doing?

01:22:03.861 --> 01:22:05.260
Doctor says he's fine.

01:22:05.461 --> 01:22:09.170
Well, I'm not fine.
She was in our house.

01:22:09.381 --> 01:22:11.292
And now our son
is in a hospital bed.

01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:13.810
You said she was in San Francisco.
Why is she back?

01:22:14.021 --> 01:22:15.739
And how did she even know
we'd be out?

01:22:15.941 --> 01:22:17.533
Obviously she was watching
your house.

01:22:17.741 --> 01:22:19.094
We need you to find her.

01:22:19.301 --> 01:22:21.371
I will do everything in my power
to find her.

01:22:21.581 --> 01:22:23.890
One of you better do something
about this woman.

01:22:24.901 --> 01:22:26.300
Or I will.

01:22:29.861 --> 01:22:31.499
So, what am I supposed to do now?

01:22:31.701 --> 01:22:33.134
- Buy a gun?
- Please.

01:22:33.341 --> 01:22:34.899
We'll have our unit tracking her.

01:22:35.101 --> 01:22:37.569
In the meantime, you better beef up
your security system.

01:22:37.781 --> 01:22:40.375
She could have hurt my son.
My son.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:03.569
Okay. You don't wanna go to sleep?

01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:05.658
- Kyle. It's okay, baby.
- It's okay.

01:23:07.501 --> 01:23:09.014
Oh, no.

01:23:09.221 --> 01:23:11.610
Oh, no. God.

01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:15.174
Jesus.

01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:17.619
This psycho.

01:23:17.821 --> 01:23:19.015
She never left.

01:23:30.821 --> 01:23:34.291
Yeah, I need to speak
to Detective Reese immediately.

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:36.298
My name, Derek Charles.

01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.179
Yeah, she knows me.

01:23:38.381 --> 01:23:40.337
This is an emergency.
I need to speak to her.

01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:44.978
Hi, it's Lisa, sorry you missed me.
Leave me a message after the beep.

01:23:46.141 --> 01:23:49.736
You listen to me.
You know exactly who this is.

01:23:50.381 --> 01:23:54.135
You came into my house,
you touched my child...

01:23:55.061 --> 01:23:57.097
and you think you're crazy?

01:23:57.301 --> 01:23:58.620
I'll show you crazy.

01:23:59.941 --> 01:24:01.215
Just try me, bitch!

01:24:05.261 --> 01:24:07.980
You're set. You ready for me
to show you how the system works?

01:24:08.181 --> 01:24:09.819
Definitely.

01:24:13.141 --> 01:24:14.130
Simple.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:17.492
You just punch in your code,
now it's armed.

01:24:17.701 --> 01:24:21.091
Case of an emergency,
this is the panic button.

01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:23.974
You touch this,
the police are knocking at your door.

01:24:24.181 --> 01:24:26.058
There's also one in your master.

01:25:42.501 --> 01:25:44.298
Okay, so you packed everything?

01:25:44.501 --> 01:25:45.570
What time you taking off?

01:25:45.781 --> 01:25:49.660
This afternoon after I pick Kyle up
from my sister's.

01:25:49.861 --> 01:25:51.419
- Okay, well, drive safely.
- Okay.

01:25:51.621 --> 01:25:53.452
- I'll be there in the morning.
- All right.

01:25:53.661 --> 01:25:55.492
- Set the alarm.
- You don't have to tell me.

01:25:55.701 --> 01:25:57.293
- I love you.
- Love you too.

01:25:58.741 --> 01:26:00.299
Bye.

01:26:08.021 --> 01:26:09.295
Derek Charles's office.

01:26:09.501 --> 01:26:10.616
Patrick.

01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:13.813
Lisa? Oh, my God, it's been forever.

01:26:14.021 --> 01:26:15.659
What, like 6 months?

01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:18.659
I know. We've got a lot of gossip
to catch up on.

01:26:18.861 --> 01:26:22.649
Well, I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I could get fired.

01:26:22.861 --> 01:26:24.977
Trust me, you're not getting fired.

01:26:25.181 --> 01:26:26.216
What do you mean?

01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:28.059
Derek didn't tell you.

01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:30.455
Tell me what?

01:26:30.661 --> 01:26:32.697
He's leaving Sharon.
They're getting a divorce.

01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:35.574
- A divorce?
- Like that's a surprise.

01:26:35.781 --> 01:26:38.500
Look, that's not gonna happen, Lisa.

01:26:38.701 --> 01:26:40.896
Patrick, come on.
I know what I'm talking about.

01:26:41.101 --> 01:26:44.980
Then why are they driving to San
Diego for her parents' anniversary?

01:26:45.181 --> 01:26:46.660
Derek's not going.

01:26:46.861 --> 01:26:48.977
Yeah, actually, he is.

01:26:49.181 --> 01:26:52.298
Sharon's leaving this afternoon,
Derek's driving down in the morning.

01:26:54.181 --> 01:26:56.137
Lisa? Did you hear me?

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.330
Patrick, I have to go.

01:26:57.541 --> 01:26:58.769
No, you just called.

01:27:32.861 --> 01:27:33.816
My purse.

01:28:39.061 --> 01:28:41.416
Joe needs these by 5.

01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:44.135
- Yeah. Sharon's on one.
- Okay.

01:28:47.141 --> 01:28:49.655
- Hey.
- Hey, baby, I just left the house.

01:28:49.861 --> 01:28:52.375
- Okay, good. You set the alarm?
- The ala--

01:28:52.581 --> 01:28:54.219
Oh, God, I forgot.

01:28:54.421 --> 01:28:56.696
Don't worry. I'm gonna get out soon.
I'll do it.

01:28:56.901 --> 01:29:00.530
No. I'm just down the hill. I'll swing
back around, and I'll call you after.

01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:02.572
Hey. Call me back.

01:31:01.221 --> 01:31:02.813
Did you not get my message?

01:31:03.021 --> 01:31:06.650
I'm so sorry. We didn't want you
to find out this way.

01:31:08.181 --> 01:31:09.739
I knew it would come to this.

01:31:09.941 --> 01:31:15.095
I know how hard it must be to have
someone fall out of love with you.

01:31:15.301 --> 01:31:16.780
I know.

01:31:19.301 --> 01:31:21.417
You are completely delusional.

01:31:22.381 --> 01:31:25.020
I'm gonna have the cops
deal with your crazy ass.

01:31:25.221 --> 01:31:27.735
- Wait, it doesn't--
- Don't touch me.

01:31:28.621 --> 01:31:31.897
- We can talk.
- I told you, don't touch me!

01:31:40.341 --> 01:31:42.138
Crazy!

01:31:42.661 --> 01:31:43.776
Get off of me!

01:32:08.341 --> 01:32:10.332
You have reached
the Charles Residence.

01:32:10.901 --> 01:32:12.334
Sharon.

01:32:12.541 --> 01:32:13.894
Are you there?

01:32:18.021 --> 01:32:19.454
- Derek.
- Lisa?

01:32:19.661 --> 01:32:22.175
What are you doing in my house?

01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:23.814
Sharon.

01:32:24.741 --> 01:32:26.299
Sharon?

01:32:27.501 --> 01:32:29.651
Derek, I'm gonna call you back.

01:32:37.381 --> 01:32:39.736
I need to speak to Detective
Reese, right now, please.

01:32:39.941 --> 01:32:41.897
Yeah. No, it's an emergency.

01:32:43.141 --> 01:32:44.210
Come here, bitch.

01:32:45.701 --> 01:32:48.215
I'm gonna wipe the floor
with your little skinny ass.

01:32:48.421 --> 01:32:51.618
Oh, you want to hold on?
You screaming now, huh?

01:32:58.981 --> 01:33:00.699
Come here!

01:33:00.901 --> 01:33:03.779
Didn't I tell you not
to come to my house?

01:33:03.981 --> 01:33:05.494
Nobody touches my child.

01:33:40.581 --> 01:33:42.651
Come on. Come here!

01:35:54.421 --> 01:35:56.059
Come on, this what you want?

01:35:56.261 --> 01:35:58.138
Come on.

01:36:11.461 --> 01:36:12.780
Come a little closer.

01:36:14.741 --> 01:36:15.935
You almost got it, come on.

01:36:16.581 --> 01:36:18.253
Come on.

01:36:25.941 --> 01:36:28.250
You want some of me?
You almost got me.

01:36:33.061 --> 01:36:34.289
Come on, bitch.

01:37:04.261 --> 01:37:05.819
Take my hand.

01:37:06.021 --> 01:37:07.659
Come on, take my hand.

01:37:09.701 --> 01:37:10.816
I got you.

01:37:17.221 --> 01:37:18.813
Come on, come on.

01:37:22.581 --> 01:37:24.060
Crazy bitch.

01:37:40.341 --> 01:37:42.059
Get off of me.

01:38:15.541 --> 01:38:17.020
Oh, God.

01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:46.138
Oh, God.

Subtitles: Arigon

01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:34.499
Sharon? You all right?

01:39:36.341 --> 01:39:37.410
What happened here?

01:39:37.621 --> 01:39:39.657
I think you know what happened.

01:39:41.621 --> 01:39:43.373
Stay here.

01:39:44.581 --> 01:39:47.095
- Oh, baby.
- You okay?

01:39:48.581 --> 01:39:51.220
- It's over.
- It's over.
