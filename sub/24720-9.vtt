WEBVTT

00:08.990 --> 00:11.870
(engine shuts off)

00:11.870 --> 00:13.200
Well?

00:13.660 --> 00:16.410
It’s a fine automobile, Alfredo.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.250
Fine?

00:17.250 --> 00:19.250
Sunsets are fine.
Puppies are fine.

00:19.250 --> 00:20.410
This car is exquisite.

00:20.410 --> 00:22.830
Six-piston GT-R,
slotted brake kit,

00:22.830 --> 00:25.160
5.4-liter
supercharged V8.

00:25.160 --> 00:26.450
Not to mention
the unbeatable

00:26.450 --> 00:28.830
security system
I designed for it.

00:28.830 --> 00:29.950
"Fine."

00:29.950 --> 00:31.080
Well, it’s just not
what I expected.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.160
That’s all. I mean,
you said we’d be touring

00:33.160 --> 00:35.000
in the most revolutionary
car out there.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.870
You think some other car
is more revolutionary?

00:37.870 --> 00:40.200
I don’t think it’s
a matter of opinion.

00:40.200 --> 00:42.990
Charles Duryea’s
1893 Motor Wagon

00:42.990 --> 00:45.290
represented the greatest
single advancement

00:45.290 --> 00:46.990
in the history
of motor craft.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.750
Fine, have it your way.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.120
Oh, man.

00:50.660 --> 00:52.620
Well, my spirits have been
elevated as you intended.

00:52.620 --> 00:56.370
The setting is just right,
and I’m as ready as I’ll ever be

00:56.370 --> 00:57.990
to entertain whatever request

00:57.990 --> 01:01.580
you’ve been working up
the gumption to voice.

01:01.580 --> 01:04.000
Okay, smart guy.

01:04.989 --> 01:09.000
I need you to help
me steal $100,000.

01:14.450 --> 01:16.160
How’d you get the
keys to the bio lab?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.990
(chuckles) My best friend’s
a T.A. in the department.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.790
Is it cool that
we’re in here?

01:20.790 --> 01:21.790
It’s fine.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.870
(grunts)
Seriously, is it?

01:23.870 --> 01:27.660
Maybe you should stop
asking so many questions, huh?

01:29.410 --> 01:32.990
Maybe I should stop
asking so many questions.

01:32.990 --> 01:35.080
(both laugh)

01:38.990 --> 01:40.330
Oh, my God!

01:40.330 --> 01:42.990
(squeaking)
Is that a rat?

01:43.540 --> 01:45.750
They’re all over the place.

01:48.790 --> 01:51.660
They’re coming
from back there.

01:51.660 --> 01:53.120
(clattering, squeaking)

01:53.120 --> 01:54.330
What is that?

01:54.330 --> 01:57.000
I don’t know,
but it’s-it’s awful.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.290
I was talking
about the sound.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.990
(squeaking continues)

02:15.370 --> 02:17.160
(gasps quietly)

02:23.580 --> 02:25.910
♪ ♪

02:26.580 --> 02:28.750
BELL:
Victim’s name is Noah Fogel.

02:28.750 --> 02:29.870
He was a biology professor.

02:29.870 --> 02:31.330
Couple of students found
his body last night,

02:31.330 --> 02:33.870
but decomp suggests
he’s been dead

02:33.870 --> 02:35.200
four or five days.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.990
How has he been
lying here that long?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.120
This campus is very busy.

02:38.120 --> 02:41.540
Usually, but everybody
was on midterm break last week.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.700
Nobody around to find Dr. Fogel.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.540
Except his rats, that is.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.990
Looks like he collapsed
into the cages,

02:47.990 --> 02:49.790
knocked them over,
the rats got out.

02:49.790 --> 02:52.540
And they repaid the favor
by eating the guy.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.990
So, what makes you think
this was a murder?

02:54.990 --> 02:57.250
Dr. Fogel
wasn’t the only casualty.

02:57.250 --> 03:01.990
CSU found four dead rats
in and around his stomach.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.950
So he ate something
that was poisoned,

03:04.950 --> 03:07.990
and then those rats ate him?

03:07.990 --> 03:08.990
Hopefully the lab will be able

03:08.990 --> 03:11.290
to tell us
what was in his system.

03:13.620 --> 03:14.950
Hmm.

03:14.950 --> 03:17.080
I think it was thallium.
What?

03:17.080 --> 03:18.990
It’s a soft metal.
It’s odorless,

03:18.990 --> 03:20.910
colorless, tasteless,
but extremely toxic.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.870
What makes you think that’s
what we’re looking at here?

03:23.870 --> 03:24.990
High doses of thallium

03:24.990 --> 03:28.200
cause hair loss,
which would explain this.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.290
Well, if you’re right,
the question is--

03:31.290 --> 03:34.250
what did this guy eat
that was laced with the stuff?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.500
Maybe those live rats
will be able to tell us.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.750
If we compare their droppings

03:37.750 --> 03:39.990
in the next few days
to what’s inside the dead ones,

03:39.990 --> 03:43.950
we might be able to identify
what item of food was poisoned.

03:43.950 --> 03:46.450
Disgusting, but I get
how it could lead us

03:46.450 --> 03:48.790
to the person
who did the poisoning.

03:48.790 --> 03:51.990
So, how do we take a bunch
of rats into evidence?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.450
BELL:
We don’t.

03:53.450 --> 03:55.620
Animal control
will come get them.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.080
Standard procedure
for any animals

03:57.080 --> 03:59.870
involved
in an investigation.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.000
Guess I should warn them

04:01.000 --> 04:04.790
these guys have a taste
for human flesh.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.000
WOMAN:Noah kept to himself really.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.250
He was studying the effects
of pesticides on small mammals.

04:13.250 --> 04:16.040
That’s why he had
so many rats in the lab.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.829
He also taught a section

04:17.829 --> 04:20.750
of undergrad biology
every semester.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.120
But his real passion
was research.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.200
He hated teaching almost as much
as his students hated him.

04:27.200 --> 04:28.870
They hated him?

04:28.870 --> 04:30.580
Noah was tough.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.450
They called him "No A"
behind his back.

04:34.450 --> 04:36.990
He sank a lot of GPAs
over the years.

04:36.990 --> 04:41.790
It’s hard to imagine anyone
would kill him over a C-plus.

04:42.790 --> 04:44.580
Can you get us a list
of the kids

04:44.580 --> 04:45.950
that he taught
the last few years?

04:45.950 --> 04:48.500
Sure.
What about Dr. Fogel’s
personal life?

04:48.500 --> 04:50.040
You said he kept
to himself.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.370
He pretty much lived
his whole life

04:52.370 --> 04:53.990
inside this building.

04:53.990 --> 04:56.410
Perhaps his drug dealer
delivered.

04:56.410 --> 04:57.120
What is it?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.870
HOLMES:
Amphetamine, by the looks of it.

04:58.870 --> 05:01.950
It appears that Dr. Fogel’s
rise to the top

05:01.950 --> 05:04.200
was not entirely self-propelled.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.250
There are 49 here.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.750
I’d wager there
were an even 50

05:06.750 --> 05:08.200
when he bought them--
likely the same day

05:08.200 --> 05:10.990
he bought this newspaper.
They were inside it.

05:11.410 --> 05:15.000
This is from last Thursday,
right around the time he died.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.410
Perhaps he was poisoned
by a bad batch of speed.

05:18.990 --> 05:20.750
Any idea who his dealer was?

05:20.750 --> 05:24.990
No. Like I said, I hardly ever
saw him with anyone.

05:25.290 --> 05:28.790
Might I suggest a good
old-fashioned witch hunt?

05:31.080 --> 05:34.750
Richie Esposito,
I’m Captain Gregson.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.250
This is Detective Bell.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.990
Thanks for coming in.

05:37.990 --> 05:38.990
Sure.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.990
What am I doing here?

05:40.990 --> 05:42.000
(chuckles)
Come on, Richie.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.410
You can’t be
too surprised.

05:43.410 --> 05:45.410
You’ve been selling
amphetamine and weed

05:45.410 --> 05:47.580
to college kids
for two years.

05:47.580 --> 05:48.580
Who told you that?

05:48.580 --> 05:49.500
Pretty much everyone.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.080
I walked around campus today.
Every kid I talked to

05:52.080 --> 05:54.290
said you were
the guy to go to

05:54.290 --> 05:56.620
for study buddies
with a witch on ’em.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.990
That’s the downside
to good branding.

05:58.990 --> 06:02.040
You made a name for yourself.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.990
Okay, fine.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.580
Wherever you got those pills,
they came from me.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.790
But this is nuts.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.410
You said this
is Major Cases, right?

06:10.410 --> 06:11.990
And you’re a captain?

06:11.990 --> 06:12.990
I’m just a guy who deals

06:12.990 --> 06:14.370
a little speed
at the student union.

06:14.370 --> 06:16.000
Don’t sell yourself short,
Richie.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.990
You’re also a murder suspect.

06:19.870 --> 06:20.500
What?

06:20.500 --> 06:22.290
Noah Fogel’s dead.

06:22.290 --> 06:23.620
Poisoned.

06:23.620 --> 06:25.580
We know he was one
of your clients.

06:25.580 --> 06:26.620
You sold those pills

06:26.620 --> 06:29.750
to Noah right before he died,
didn’t you?

06:29.750 --> 06:31.500
What’s the lab gonna tell us

06:31.500 --> 06:32.700
about what’s in them?

06:32.700 --> 06:33.870
Nothing. My stuff is clean.

06:33.870 --> 06:35.910
But as far as Noah goes,
he was a great customer.

06:35.910 --> 06:40.200
He paid up front, on time,
and never caused any trouble.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.580
I was making a killing
off that guy,

06:42.580 --> 06:43.660
especially lately.

06:43.660 --> 06:44.500
What do you mean?

06:44.500 --> 06:45.990
He was buying more pills
than ever.

06:45.990 --> 06:49.620
He said, uh, he was staying
up late working on some...

06:49.620 --> 06:51.750
secret project.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.830
You need to find out
what it was.

06:55.830 --> 06:56.870
Why?

06:56.870 --> 06:58.580
Because he said it was

06:58.580 --> 07:00.660
going to be the death of him.

07:00.660 --> 07:03.000
I thought he was joking,
but...

07:03.000 --> 07:04.990
I don’t know-- maybe it was.

07:04.990 --> 07:06.990
You think someone killed him
over his research?

07:06.990 --> 07:12.370
All I know is he’s dead
and I didn’t do it.

07:12.370 --> 07:13.950
Figure out what
he was working on,

07:13.950 --> 07:17.120
maybe you’ll find
the person who did.

07:18.410 --> 07:20.620
HOLMES:
That "safest rides
in New York" sign

07:20.620 --> 07:22.540
looks like it was
painted by a child.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.410
Have you considered
the possibility that the owner

07:24.410 --> 07:25.830
of this establishment
hasn’t paid you

07:25.830 --> 07:27.160
because he’s an imbecile
and simply forgot?

07:27.160 --> 07:29.200
No, it’s ’cause he’s
a piece of garbage.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.620
I told you it
took me a month

07:30.620 --> 07:33.580
to install security systems
in every car in his fleet.

07:33.580 --> 07:36.580
And you haven’t been paid
for parts or labor?

07:36.580 --> 07:37.450
98 G’s.

07:37.450 --> 07:40.540
Owner said I did shoddy work,
refused to pay.

07:40.540 --> 07:43.120
You ever know me
to do shoddy work?

07:43.750 --> 07:46.450
Owner keeps a lot of cash
in a safe inside.

07:46.450 --> 07:48.120
I’m only gonna take
what I’m owed.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.580
Obviously, the alarm system’s
not a problem,

07:50.580 --> 07:53.500
but I’m no expert when it
comes to cracking safes.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.450
His is in a wall.

07:54.450 --> 07:56.160
It’s got a dial
combination.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.410
Think you can crack it?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.790
As I told you before,
planning the perfect crime

08:00.790 --> 08:02.910
is child’s play
compared to unraveling one.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.330
But I’m just... I’m not
seeing the whole picture.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.120
Oh, place backs up
into a warehouse.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.790
There’s nobody
there after 6:00.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.120
No, that’s not
what I meant.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.370
I’ve heard no mention
of a civil lawsuit,

08:12.370 --> 08:14.790
claims court,
Better Business Bureau.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.120
There are any number
of non-felonious ways

08:17.120 --> 08:19.370
that you could make
yourself whole.

08:19.370 --> 08:21.370
Your willingness
to stoop to theft

08:21.370 --> 08:26.500
suggests a dire crisis,
so... what’s going on?

08:26.500 --> 08:29.200
It’s my brother.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.370
Dante?

08:30.370 --> 08:31.370
He put you up to this?

08:31.370 --> 08:33.500
No, he doesn’t know
anything about it.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.990
His silk screen
company went belly-up.

08:35.990 --> 08:38.789
He owes his business
partners 85 grand.

08:38.789 --> 08:42.830
If he doesn’t pay in three days,
it’s kneecaps-- at least.

08:42.830 --> 08:45.250
Well, the good news is they
could never break his spine,

08:45.250 --> 08:46.870
’cause we both know
he hasn’t got one.

08:46.870 --> 08:49.990
Sherlock.
Come to think of it,
he hasn’t got a heart, either.

08:49.990 --> 08:53.040
If he’s in trouble,
he no doubt deserves it.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.830
He deserves more.

08:54.830 --> 08:56.000
I’m not going to help him.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.290
But you’re not helping him;
you’re helping me.

08:58.290 --> 09:00.990
It’s my money, and
I want it back.

09:01.540 --> 09:03.450
You in or out?
Out.

09:03.450 --> 09:05.200
You serious?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.370
When am I not?

09:08.990 --> 09:11.580
(sighs)
(engine starts)

09:17.040 --> 09:21.620
(cacophony of animal sounds
plays over stereo)

09:21.620 --> 09:23.990
WATSON:
What is that sound?

09:23.990 --> 09:26.450
Mating calls of the Serengeti.

09:26.450 --> 09:28.500
A number of studies
have concluded

09:28.500 --> 09:29.990
that exposure to nature sounds

09:29.990 --> 09:32.330
can reduce stress
and improve focus.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.450
Yeah, I think they were talking
about, like, rain

09:34.450 --> 09:36.990
or ocean waves,
not horny wildebeests.

09:36.990 --> 09:39.450
(turns stereo volume down)

09:39.450 --> 09:40.450
What’s all this?

09:40.450 --> 09:41.620
This is every bit
of research

09:41.620 --> 09:43.950
that was available
at Dr. Fogel’s lab.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.250
I had it sent over when Marcus

09:45.250 --> 09:47.990
said his drug dealer
was a dead end.

09:47.990 --> 09:48.990
Got the same message.

09:48.990 --> 09:51.660
Guy was a sleaze,
but the speed he sold

09:51.660 --> 09:52.790
tested negative for thallium.

09:52.790 --> 09:55.120
So, you see anything
worth killing over?

09:55.120 --> 09:58.000
So far, nothing that
might pertain to

09:58.000 --> 10:00.990
the secret project
the drug dealer was alluding to.

10:00.990 --> 10:03.290
It’s hard to imagine the news
that pesticides

10:03.290 --> 10:05.870
should not be injected
directly into rat brains

10:05.870 --> 10:06.990
would shock the world.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.750
Everything okay with Alfredo?

10:09.750 --> 10:10.990
As a matter of fact, no.

10:10.990 --> 10:12.660
He is, uh, quite
keen on burglarizing

10:12.660 --> 10:16.660
a used car dealership,
and he asked me to help.

10:16.660 --> 10:16.990
What?

10:16.990 --> 10:19.450
I-I’ve no qualms
in committing the crime.

10:19.450 --> 10:21.660
The, uh, proprietor
owes him money.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.990
The problem is
he revealed the heist

10:23.990 --> 10:25.990
is to benefit
his brother, Dante,

10:25.990 --> 10:27.250
who’s fallen
on hard times.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.990
So...?
So, Dante’s a cancer,

10:30.990 --> 10:32.250
and he deserves hard times.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.450
He deserves more, actually.

10:33.450 --> 10:35.330
You know him?
I know his story.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.990
Growing up, Alfredo’s parents
were often absent,

10:37.990 --> 10:39.990
so there was little
to prevent Dante

10:39.990 --> 10:41.250
from dragging
his younger brother

10:41.250 --> 10:42.990
into his burgeoning
criminal career.

10:42.990 --> 10:45.290
Alfredo’s first fight,
his first shoplift,

10:45.290 --> 10:48.990
his introduction to heroin--
all Dante’s handiwork.

10:48.990 --> 10:51.990
Alfredo asked you
for a favor, you said no,

10:51.990 --> 10:53.080
so why are you still angry?

10:53.080 --> 10:55.540
’Cause after I turned him down,
he had the temerity

10:55.540 --> 10:57.000
to say that was what
he expected.

10:57.000 --> 11:00.910
That I have no idea what it
means to be a good brother.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.410
He knows about Mycroft?

11:02.410 --> 11:03.750
Well, he used to be my sponsor.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.750
He remains one
of my closest confidants,

11:05.750 --> 11:08.000
so yes, he knows
all about my brother.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.120
I’m confused.

11:09.120 --> 11:11.790
Are you mad at Alfredo
right now or Mycroft?

11:11.790 --> 11:13.250
Because I thought
you made peace

11:13.250 --> 11:14.870
with what he did
a long time ago.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.410
Uh, respectfully, Watson,
I just... I need

11:16.410 --> 11:18.330
peace and quiet
to finish this work, so...

11:18.330 --> 11:20.120
I’ll let you know
if I find anything

11:20.120 --> 11:23.410
that might lead us
to Noah Fogel’s killer.

11:26.290 --> 11:28.910
(dogs barking, rats squeaking)

11:28.910 --> 11:31.910
"The sex scandal
that rocked the statehouse

11:31.910 --> 11:33.120
"took another turn Monday,

11:33.120 --> 11:35.450
"when the lieutenant
governor’s office

11:35.450 --> 11:37.620
disclosed
misappropriated funds."

11:37.620 --> 11:39.370
These knuckleheads in Albany
can’t keep it

11:39.370 --> 11:42.990
in their pants, Piper.
(explosions outside)

11:42.990 --> 11:45.660
(dogs barking)

11:47.660 --> 11:50.990
(explosions continue)

12:09.990 --> 12:12.540
(dogs continue barking)

12:15.290 --> 12:18.830
(vehicle door closes,
engine starts)

12:19.500 --> 12:21.620
(tires squealing)

12:28.120 --> 12:30.250
What the...?

12:34.990 --> 12:37.660
Hey, boss, it’s Wade.
I’m sorry to call so late.

12:37.660 --> 12:40.830
You know them lab rats
the cops brought over?

12:40.830 --> 12:43.200
Yeah, the ones
from the crime scene.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.990
Somebody just stole them all.

12:47.190 --> 12:49.490
The rats were right here
when I went out to see who was

12:49.490 --> 12:52.240
setting off the fireworks.
What about the gray van you saw

12:52.240 --> 12:53.900
pulling away from the building?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.780
Did you see the driver?
Sorry.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.360
It was dark. I was far away.

12:57.360 --> 13:02.030
I think the license plate
started with a "T" or "L."

13:03.950 --> 13:05.030
You have security cameras?

13:05.030 --> 13:07.690
Nah. There’s barely
enough money here

13:07.690 --> 13:08.650
to feed the animals.

13:08.650 --> 13:09.860
What’s so important
about these rats?

13:09.860 --> 13:11.450
It’s not like
they’re witnesses, right?

13:11.450 --> 13:12.360
Well, we think
the person

13:12.360 --> 13:13.950
who stole the rats
might be our killer,

13:13.950 --> 13:15.700
so we’re hoping
to find something here

13:15.700 --> 13:17.530
that would lead
us to him.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.690
Her.

13:18.690 --> 13:20.690
I found this in the parking lot.

13:20.690 --> 13:21.690
What is it?

13:21.690 --> 13:23.530
It’s the edge of a shirt cuff.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.690
Given the button and
the floral detailing,

13:24.690 --> 13:27.150
I’d say it belonged
to a woman’s blouse.

13:27.150 --> 13:29.320
Note the distinct aroma.

13:29.320 --> 13:30.690
Hmm. Fireworks.

13:30.690 --> 13:32.690
HOLMES: Black powder,
antimony trisulfide

13:32.690 --> 13:34.570
and dextrin, to be precise.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.110
The thief lit a
dozen Roman candles,

13:36.110 --> 13:37.360
but I think this is the one that

13:37.360 --> 13:39.690
gave her some problems.
As you can see, it misfired,

13:39.690 --> 13:41.780
exploding from here
rather than at the top.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.360
Now, if I’m right,
the woman who lit it was struck

13:44.360 --> 13:47.690
by a flaming substance which
burns at 600 degrees centigrade.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.150
Ouch.
Indeed.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.700
And the odds are
quite good that after

13:50.700 --> 13:52.700
absconding with the rats,
the thief went

13:52.700 --> 13:54.700
to the nearest hospital
for treatment.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.150
And if she did...

13:56.150 --> 13:58.360
We can identify her.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.990
HOLMES:
So you still have
all your fingers.

14:00.990 --> 14:01.700
You’re very lucky.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.320
Firework accidents
can be very serious.

14:04.320 --> 14:07.030
I told you,
I burnt myself cooking.

14:07.030 --> 14:10.650
I don’t know anything about any
animal shelter getting robbed.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.860
BELL:
Stop.

14:11.860 --> 14:12.860
Okay, we already confirmed

14:12.860 --> 14:14.570
that you rented
a gray van yesterday,

14:14.570 --> 14:17.240
same kind that was seen
peeling away from the shelter.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.400
HOLMES: I’m curious--
did you set the rodents

14:19.400 --> 14:22.570
you stole free, or...
did you murder them as well?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.110
What?
WATSON: We know you
took Noah Fogel’s rats

14:25.110 --> 14:28.150
so we wouldn’t figure out
how you poisoned him.

14:28.150 --> 14:32.280
What we don’t know
is what you had against him.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.360
No. No way.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.690
I did steal the rats.
Okay, you got me.

14:37.690 --> 14:40.150
But I had nothing to do
with Noah’s death.

14:40.150 --> 14:43.280
You could see how that
would be hard for us to believe?

14:43.280 --> 14:44.240
I’m a geneticist.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.690
I was in Iowa last week
for a conference.

14:46.690 --> 14:47.820
I got back yesterday morning.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.070
I wasn’t even here
when Noah died.

14:50.070 --> 14:51.240
Our lab found thallium

14:51.240 --> 14:53.280
in a carton of milk
at Noah’s house.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.690
You could have dosed it
before you left.

14:55.690 --> 14:56.700
No. You can have

14:56.700 --> 14:57.690
my fingerprints, my DNA.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.740
I will give you
whatever you want.

14:59.740 --> 15:00.820
HOLMES:
How about...

15:00.820 --> 15:02.690
a reason that you
would have stolen

15:02.690 --> 15:07.450
dozens of lab rats,
if not to cover up the murder?

15:07.700 --> 15:10.990
Is $5 million
a good enough reason?

15:12.110 --> 15:14.860
I was trying to win
the Galahad Prize.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.820
As in the Galahad Institute.

15:18.610 --> 15:19.650
It’s a nonprofit.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.650
They’re trying to find
a cure for aging.

15:21.650 --> 15:23.150
They offered
five million bucks

15:23.150 --> 15:24.280
to the first person who could

15:24.280 --> 15:26.690
genetically alter a rat
to double its life span.

15:26.690 --> 15:30.030
How is creating a bunch
of geriatric rats

15:30.030 --> 15:31.690
gonna stop humans from aging?

15:31.690 --> 15:34.690
First, you work
toward everlasting rats,

15:34.690 --> 15:35.690
then pigs and dogs,

15:35.690 --> 15:38.360
then monkeys and apes,
and one day...

15:38.360 --> 15:39.690
Everlasting us.

15:39.690 --> 15:41.070
The Galahad Prize
was supposed to

15:41.070 --> 15:42.820
inspire people
to take the first steps.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.690
Noah Fogel had
taken quite a few.

15:44.690 --> 15:47.820
One of his rats lived
to the age of six last month.

15:47.820 --> 15:49.650
That is close
to hitting the benchmark.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.700
When I heard Noah was dead,
I called around

15:51.700 --> 15:53.280
to see what happened
to his animals.

15:53.280 --> 15:57.690
I thought, if I could
reverse-engineer his process...

15:58.280 --> 16:00.530
...I might win
the five million myself,

16:00.530 --> 16:03.360
but I didn’t kill him.

16:08.950 --> 16:10.740
I know we can’t
rule her out completely,

16:10.740 --> 16:13.690
but I don’t think she did it.
I don’t think so, either.

16:13.690 --> 16:15.030
But it’s easy
to imagine

16:15.030 --> 16:16.030
someone like her did.

16:16.030 --> 16:18.110
If winning the Galahad Prize was
the secret project

16:18.110 --> 16:19.490
that Mr. Fogel
was involved in,

16:19.490 --> 16:21.320
then their pool of contestants

16:21.320 --> 16:23.650
could easily double
as our pool of suspects.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.780
The institute she mentioned
is worth visiting.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.530
Find out who else
is competing for the money.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.530
All right. You guys go.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.690
I’ll look into her story,
see if it holds water.

16:31.690 --> 16:34.360
I’ll call you
if I find anything.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.570
"Named after Sir Galahad,
the famed Arthurian knight

16:38.570 --> 16:41.450
"who gained immortality
by touching the Holy Grail,

16:41.450 --> 16:44.070

"by Dudley Becket,

"and heir to the celebrated

16:49.900 --> 16:51.740
Their best-selling product
is rectal cream.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.690
I’m not sure
who’s celebrating them.

16:53.690 --> 16:57.070
Well, if it’s not you,
you should count yourself lucky.

16:57.070 --> 16:59.610
"For more than 25 years,

17:10.569 --> 17:13.950

from the tyranny of death."

17:13.950 --> 17:15.069
A perfectly admirable quest

17:15.069 --> 17:17.359
made to sound
like a delusion of grandeur

17:17.359 --> 17:19.609
by an incompetent copywriter.

17:23.030 --> 17:24.069
Last night, you asked

17:24.069 --> 17:27.490
if I still harbored ill
feelings towards my brother.

17:27.490 --> 17:29.650
I do.

17:30.490 --> 17:33.990
A bunch of French mobsters
wanted to kill him.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.450
Did he solve the problem
the way you would have?

17:36.450 --> 17:39.530
No, but you’ve got
to get over it.

17:40.740 --> 17:41.690
What?

17:41.690 --> 17:44.780
Couple of months ago,
during my sabbatical in Vermont,

17:44.780 --> 17:46.650
I read a story
in a French newspaper

17:46.650 --> 17:49.200
about a particularly nasty
drug war in Andorra.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.860
The leadership
of Le Milieu

17:50.860 --> 17:54.570
was completely wiped out
by the Sicilian Mafia.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.280
Are you saying
that all the people

17:56.280 --> 17:57.530
that wanted to kill Mycroft

17:57.530 --> 17:59.360
are dead?
As French doornails.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.690
Did a bit of digging.

18:00.690 --> 18:03.490
There is no longer
any threat against him.

18:03.490 --> 18:05.400
There is also no
chance that he’s

18:05.400 --> 18:06.450
unaware of this development.

18:06.450 --> 18:08.070
He could be sitting here
with us now

18:08.070 --> 18:10.280
at this very moment
if he so chose.

18:10.280 --> 18:11.530
Why didn’t you tell me?

18:11.530 --> 18:13.360
I suppose I was angry.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.360
A little embarrassed.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.700
My brother no longer has
a price on his head,

18:15.700 --> 18:18.690
and I had to learn about that
from a newspaper.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.400
Did you
reach out to him?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.400
Why would I?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.280
Because he’s your brother.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.240
The dissolution
of our relationship

18:25.240 --> 18:27.690
is a mess entirely
of his making.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.030
Reestablishing
communication

18:29.030 --> 18:30.820
is his responsibility.

18:30.820 --> 18:31.690
Are you seriously keeping score?

18:31.690 --> 18:33.150
It doesn’t matter
who calls who first.

18:33.150 --> 18:34.530
You get to see
your brother again.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.690
You’re taking his side--
understandably.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.200
Perhaps if I’d have given you
three and a half orgasms,

18:39.200 --> 18:40.570
you’d see things my way.

18:40.570 --> 18:44.320
Excuse me?
MAN: Mr. Holmes. Ms. Watson.

18:44.320 --> 18:45.690
I’m Hunter Becket.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.650
This way, please.

18:48.570 --> 18:50.650
(Holmes clears throat)

18:50.650 --> 18:52.110
Dad, these are the
police consultants.

18:52.110 --> 18:55.490
Mr. Holmes, Ms. Watson,
this is my father Dudley.

18:55.490 --> 18:56.950
He’s the real brains
around here.

18:56.950 --> 19:00.690
Well, if I’m the brains,
then, uh,

19:00.690 --> 19:01.740
Hunter is the brawn.

19:01.740 --> 19:04.740
He’s the one who’s kept
the Galahad Institute

19:04.740 --> 19:08.690
pushing forward
since my surgery.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.360
Titanium.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.320
Last year. My joints
are the only part of me

19:11.320 --> 19:13.240
the worms don’t get to eat.

19:13.240 --> 19:14.690
That’s assuming the worms
get any of you.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.240
The whole point
of this place is to extend

19:16.240 --> 19:17.530
life indefinitely,
is it not?

19:17.530 --> 19:21.320
Don’t think we’re gonna
get there in my lifetime.

19:21.320 --> 19:22.740
Maybe Hunter’s.
But yes,

19:22.740 --> 19:27.150
one day, the research we fund,
the scientists we support,

19:27.150 --> 19:29.030
it’s going to change life
on this planet.

19:29.030 --> 19:31.690
WATSON:
Actually, we’re
here to talk about

19:31.690 --> 19:32.860
one of your scientists.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.450
Are you aware
of what happened to Noah Fogel?

19:35.450 --> 19:37.110
It’s tragic.
He was such a smart guy.

19:37.110 --> 19:38.650
DUDLEY: I can’t
tell you how much

19:38.650 --> 19:42.690
I wanted to write a check
for $5 million to that man.

19:42.690 --> 19:44.400
He was close.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.690
We’re exploring the possibility

19:45.690 --> 19:48.570
that one of his competitors
killed him.

19:48.570 --> 19:49.860
They wanted to buy time

19:49.860 --> 19:52.610
so they could get
the $5 million.

19:52.610 --> 19:53.360
I’m-I’m sorry.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.450
The entire point of this contest
is to preserve life.

19:55.450 --> 19:56.950
To think that someone
would kill over it...

19:56.950 --> 20:00.690
Have you talked to his partner?
We weren’t aware
he had a partner.

20:00.690 --> 20:01.740
Elijah Robinson.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.690
Brilliant geneticist, but, uh...

20:04.690 --> 20:05.690
troubled.

20:05.690 --> 20:08.240
He had a chaired position
at one of those

20:08.240 --> 20:10.690
Oxbridge places, right?
They gave him the boot.

20:10.690 --> 20:14.150
He slept with a student
and beat up her boyfriend.

20:14.150 --> 20:16.860
Nobody we spoke to
mentioned Elijah.

20:16.860 --> 20:18.740
Are you sure they
were working together?

20:18.740 --> 20:22.320
Well, I couldn’t speak to how
they divvied up their research,

20:22.320 --> 20:24.150
but, uh, they cosigned

20:24.150 --> 20:26.690
their grant requests
and status reports.

20:26.690 --> 20:30.320
So you think that Elijah is the
person we should be looking for?

20:30.320 --> 20:32.860
Like I said, he’s troubled.

20:32.860 --> 20:37.490
I don’t suppose you’d have
his address on file, would you?

20:39.360 --> 20:40.860
Seems a little excessive,
don’t you think?

20:40.860 --> 20:44.240
Mr. Robinson’s a research
biologist, not a commando.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.900
BELL: He’s a person of interest
in a homicide.

20:46.900 --> 20:47.700
In a poisoning.

20:47.700 --> 20:50.360
I mean, as long as we
turn down the tea service,

20:50.360 --> 20:51.400
I think we’ll be fine.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.450
BELL: Mr. Robinson has three
semiautomatic rifles

20:53.450 --> 20:57.030
registered to his name and
two priors for violent assault.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.200
So last time, he used poison.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.860
This time, he might use
his Smith & Wesson.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.740
MAN (over radio):
Marcus, we found him.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.690
Looks like he’s
been dead over a week.

21:06.690 --> 21:07.690
Yeah, smells like it, too.

21:07.690 --> 21:10.860
That would mean he died
before Professor Fogel.

21:10.860 --> 21:13.360
Doesn’t mean he
isn’t our poisoner.

21:13.360 --> 21:14.610
Given his own
murder, though,

21:14.610 --> 21:17.690
his culpability does
seem less likely.

21:19.570 --> 21:22.450
Hmm. Someone hit him
with something heavy.

21:22.450 --> 21:26.400
I can feel a major fracture
between his spine

21:26.400 --> 21:28.150
and occipital bone.

21:28.150 --> 21:29.450
Probably what
killed him.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.950
HOLMES: That may be, but
I don’t think that was

21:31.950 --> 21:33.200
the killer’s plan.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.360
I think he had an entirely
different modusin mind.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.490
What are you talking about?

21:38.490 --> 21:40.400
This.

21:43.700 --> 21:44.700
Is that paint?

21:44.700 --> 21:46.070
Pigment, actually.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.690
Prussian blue,
to be exact.

21:47.690 --> 21:50.690
Which also doubles as the
antidote for thallium poisoning.

21:50.690 --> 21:53.690
You saying, if Noah Fogel
got to an art store in time,

21:53.690 --> 21:55.110
he could’ve saved himself?

21:55.110 --> 21:57.740
Prussian blue
is an ion exchange material.

21:57.740 --> 22:00.400
You swallow it,
it pulls the toxin

22:00.400 --> 22:01.700
out of your system
so you expel it.

22:01.700 --> 22:04.900
I submit the killer brought it
with him as a safety precaution.

22:04.900 --> 22:07.860
His original plan
was to lace Elijah’s milk

22:07.860 --> 22:09.690
as he did with Dr. Fogel.

22:09.690 --> 22:12.030
The Prussian blue was
in case he exposed himself.

22:12.030 --> 22:14.110
So he broke in, he’s in here

22:14.110 --> 22:16.240
monkeying with the milk
when Elijah

22:16.240 --> 22:18.450
comes home from
the grocery store.

22:18.450 --> 22:23.900
And then they fought
to the death.

22:24.650 --> 22:28.570
At some point, I’d say Elijah
was felled with a...

22:28.570 --> 22:31.070
a blow from perhaps
this rolling pin.

22:31.070 --> 22:32.530
Which is a weapon
of convenience.

22:32.530 --> 22:34.030
I mean, we can, uh,
test it for prints,

22:34.030 --> 22:37.690
but it’s likely the killer wore
gloves to handle the poison.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.570
Well, then he should’ve
done a better job

22:39.570 --> 22:41.070
cleaning up before he left.

22:41.070 --> 22:42.400
This is not pigment.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.320
It’s dried blood.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.690
You think it’s
from the killer?

22:45.690 --> 22:47.030
Well, it didn’t come
from Elijah.

22:47.030 --> 22:50.030
Even with the decomp, I can tell
he doesn’t have any open wounds.

22:50.030 --> 22:51.860
The fight didn’t leave him
bleeding.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.280
The killer must have gotten cut.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.400
Well, if
you’re right,

22:55.400 --> 22:58.690
let’s hope he’s
in the system.

23:01.530 --> 23:03.070
BELL:
Hey, Captain.

23:03.070 --> 23:04.400
Sorry to catch you
on your way out,

23:04.400 --> 23:07.490
but you know that blood we found
at Elijah Robinson’s house?

23:07.490 --> 23:08.950
Yeah.
Well, we got a hit.

23:08.950 --> 23:12.740
I’m pretty sure
you’re gonna want to see it.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.150
GREGSON:
You gotta be kidding me.

23:14.150 --> 23:15.700
BELL:
No, I had the lab double-check.

23:15.700 --> 23:18.070
She’s a perfect match
for the blood.

23:18.070 --> 23:19.780
A 15-year-old girl?

23:19.780 --> 23:21.570
Her name’s Lacey Evans.

23:21.570 --> 23:23.700
She’s a freshman at
Saint Matthew’s Academy.

23:23.700 --> 23:25.150
She’s on the honor roll.

23:25.150 --> 23:26.320
She does field hockey.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.150
And now she’s a suspect
in two murders.

23:31.850 --> 23:36.060
Mom, where’d you put
my field hockey stuff?

23:38.390 --> 23:39.560
What?

23:39.560 --> 23:43.850
Why would you think
that was my blood?

23:43.850 --> 23:46.390
Well, when your father
was stationed in Riyadh,

23:46.390 --> 23:48.980
everyone in your family
got put into the Army’s

23:48.980 --> 23:50.940
DNA registry
in case of a kidnapping.

23:50.940 --> 23:53.520
That’s why your DNA’s
in the system.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.100
What we don’t know is why

23:55.100 --> 23:58.350
it was in the home
of a murder victim.

23:58.350 --> 24:00.100
Say something, honey.

24:00.100 --> 24:01.980
Please.

24:01.980 --> 24:03.940
Look, we don’t think you did it.

24:03.940 --> 24:05.900
Okay? Elijah Robinson
was twice your size.

24:05.900 --> 24:09.520
It’s hard to imagine you’re
the one who bashed in his skull.

24:09.520 --> 24:11.400
But you were there, right?

24:11.400 --> 24:13.390
You saw who did?

24:13.390 --> 24:14.810
No.

24:14.810 --> 24:16.390
But...

24:16.390 --> 24:18.390
I did know Elijah.

24:18.390 --> 24:19.390
How?

24:19.390 --> 24:20.770
Ma’am.

24:21.390 --> 24:22.230
Can you tell us

24:22.230 --> 24:25.100
how your blood got on the door
to his refrigerator?

24:25.100 --> 24:28.310
That is where he was storing it.

24:28.310 --> 24:30.900
My blood, I mean.

24:30.900 --> 24:32.520
Uh, I-I was selling it to him.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.690
That’s how I knew him.

24:33.690 --> 24:36.390
What do you mean, you were
selling your blood to him?

24:36.390 --> 24:38.810
Last year, my friend
Jenna told me

24:38.810 --> 24:41.480
that her uncle would
pay cash for it.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.390
A hundred bucks
every donation.

24:43.390 --> 24:49.190
Sounded sketchy,
but she said that Elijah--

24:49.190 --> 24:50.940
that’s her uncle--

24:50.940 --> 24:52.390
he knew what he was doing.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.190
She said it would be
safe and clean.

24:54.190 --> 24:57.060
What exactly did he want
with your blood?

24:57.060 --> 24:58.480
He was selling it.

24:59.480 --> 25:02.190
Mine and Jenna’s.

25:02.190 --> 25:05.020
To, like, old people.

25:05.020 --> 25:07.190
They-they’d
inject blood

25:07.190 --> 25:09.390
from teenagers to feel young.

25:09.390 --> 25:10.650
I’ve heard about this.

25:10.650 --> 25:12.520
There’s a growing market
for young blood.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.600
But it is unregulated.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.850
Probably how Elijah
was paying his bills.

25:16.850 --> 25:17.690
Mom...

25:17.690 --> 25:19.310
I stopped
doing it, okay?

25:19.310 --> 25:22.850
If I hadn’t,
maybe I’d be dead, too.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.690
What do you mean?

25:25.390 --> 25:26.390
This one time,

25:26.390 --> 25:29.810
Jenna and I showed up
at Elijah’s house, and...

25:29.810 --> 25:32.940
he was fighting
outside with some guy.

25:32.940 --> 25:34.390
They were, like,
pushing and shoving.

25:34.390 --> 25:36.350
It was, like, a legit fight.

25:36.350 --> 25:37.560
When was this?

25:37.560 --> 25:38.440
Few months ago.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.270
It totally
freaked us out.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.390
That’s when we stopped going.

25:42.390 --> 25:44.600
Who was this guy?

25:44.600 --> 25:46.020
I-I don’t know.

25:46.020 --> 25:49.770
But I got the whole thing
on my phone.

25:49.770 --> 25:53.520
I can send you the video
if you want.

25:55.230 --> 25:57.980
HOLMES:
There was $114,000 in the safe.

25:57.980 --> 26:00.390
I didn’t heed your advice.
I took it all.

26:00.390 --> 26:02.390
Donated the, uh,
remainder to charity.

26:02.390 --> 26:05.770
I didn’t ask you to rob
the dealership by yourself.

26:05.770 --> 26:08.390
I didn’t think you
were gonna help at all.

26:08.390 --> 26:09.440
Well, I reconsidered.

26:09.440 --> 26:10.480
Dante may not have cared

26:10.480 --> 26:14.390
that you would’ve ended up
in prison again, but...

26:14.390 --> 26:16.390
I would have.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.980
You didn’t rob anyone.

26:18.980 --> 26:20.350
I just told you I did.

26:20.350 --> 26:21.850
I was your sponsor
for two years.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.440
I can tell when you’re lying.

26:23.440 --> 26:24.390
This is your money.

26:24.390 --> 26:26.230
Does its provenance
really matter?

26:26.230 --> 26:28.150
You wanted to help
your brother.

26:28.150 --> 26:30.520
Now you can.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.940
Thanks, but no, thanks.

26:34.850 --> 26:37.100
If I’ve wounded your pride
in some way,

26:37.100 --> 26:39.390
just consider it payment
for services rendered.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.390
You’ve lent me your expertise
on many of my cases.

26:42.390 --> 26:44.390
It’s not about pride, okay?

26:44.390 --> 26:45.270
It’s about you,

26:45.270 --> 26:47.770
how you treat people
who make mistakes.

26:47.770 --> 26:51.390
(sighs) How many second and
third chances have you gotten?

26:51.390 --> 26:52.390
Plenty, right?

26:52.390 --> 26:53.810
Now, how often
do you give ’em?

26:53.810 --> 26:55.390
I’ve forgiven many people
their sins

26:55.390 --> 26:56.810
over the years.
Is that right?

26:56.810 --> 26:58.390
Yeah.
’Cause I haven’t seen it.

26:58.390 --> 26:59.560
I mean, don’t get me wrong.

26:59.560 --> 27:00.900
If it was someone
from the program

27:00.900 --> 27:02.560
and they were going
through the steps

27:02.560 --> 27:03.690
and they asked for forgiveness,

27:03.690 --> 27:05.390
you’d give it in a second,
but come on, man,

27:05.390 --> 27:07.810
my brother, yours, it’s like...
you want them to find

27:07.810 --> 27:09.440
the deepest hole they can
and jump in.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.020
Let’s leave my brother
out of this.

27:11.020 --> 27:14.390
I’d love to, but he’s obviously
part of the problem.

27:15.350 --> 27:17.400
You hold grudges.

27:18.390 --> 27:20.690
It’s not good.

27:20.690 --> 27:22.390
(sighs)

27:22.390 --> 27:25.310
Just take the check, Alfredo.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.900
(sighs)

27:26.900 --> 27:29.390
You know, it’s funny--
you can, um...

27:29.390 --> 27:32.390
you can be really generous
when you want to be.

27:32.390 --> 27:33.400
You should think about

27:33.400 --> 27:35.940
being that way
more often.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.390
Looks good on you.

27:43.810 --> 27:45.650
WATSON:
You’re still watching that video

27:45.650 --> 27:46.600
that Lacey Evans gave us?

27:46.600 --> 27:48.560
I told you, you can’t
see the guy’s face

27:48.560 --> 27:49.900
who’s fighting
with Elijah Robinson.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.310
Marcus and I went over it
a hundred times.

27:52.310 --> 27:55.100
Well, I’m at 203.
You can join me for 204.

27:55.100 --> 27:57.390
What did you do to it?
When we watched it,

27:57.390 --> 27:58.770
there was this weird pink tint.

27:58.770 --> 27:59.810
Yes, Miss Evans ran her

27:59.810 --> 28:00.980
little Zapruder film
through this

28:00.980 --> 28:02.940
grotesque filter
called "Cozy Rosy."

28:02.940 --> 28:05.560
I couldn’t bear it, so I
corrected the chroma scheme.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.730
I’ve been trying to read
the late Mr. Robinson’s lips,

28:07.730 --> 28:10.770
but the shaky camera work has
made it a little bit difficult.

28:10.770 --> 28:14.230
I was wondering
why he kept saying,

28:14.230 --> 28:16.390
"You go," to his assailant.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.980
But then I realized
he wasn’t saying, "You go."

28:18.980 --> 28:20.020
He was saying, "Hugo."

28:20.020 --> 28:21.940
He knew his attacker,
and his name is Hugo.

28:21.940 --> 28:25.150
Unfortunately, that’s not
enough to identify him.

28:25.150 --> 28:27.690
We do need more.
You can stop.

28:28.390 --> 28:30.350
He works at Burrito Land.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.390
It’s a fast food chain.
You would hate it.

28:32.390 --> 28:34.390
Um, I couldn’t tell
the color of his shirt

28:34.390 --> 28:35.850
when everything was pink,
but now that

28:35.850 --> 28:37.390
you got rid of
the filter, I can see

28:37.390 --> 28:40.390
that the stripes on his
shirt are mauve and orange.

28:40.390 --> 28:42.310
Nobody would put
those two colors together

28:42.310 --> 28:43.850
except Burrito Land.

28:43.850 --> 28:45.400
I mean, there can’t be that many

28:45.400 --> 28:49.390
employees there
named Hugo, right?

28:51.520 --> 28:52.940
Mr. Irving, I’m Captain Gregson.

28:52.940 --> 28:55.270
This is Detective Bell.
I don’t care who you are.

28:55.270 --> 28:58.390
I just want you to tell
me what I’m doing here.

28:58.390 --> 29:01.390
Noah Fogel and Elijah Robinson

29:01.390 --> 29:05.400
were both found dead this week,
and we think you killed them.

29:05.400 --> 29:08.400
They’re dead?

29:08.400 --> 29:09.390
Both of them?

29:09.390 --> 29:11.560
You’re going to tell us
you didn’t know?

29:11.560 --> 29:13.980
(chuckles) I didn’t.

29:13.980 --> 29:17.230
But I can tell you
it’s a good thing.

29:17.230 --> 29:18.440
A blessing, in fact.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.230
You shouldn’t arrest
whoever did it.

29:20.230 --> 29:21.390
You should thank them.

29:21.390 --> 29:22.600
How is that?

29:22.600 --> 29:25.650
There’s a natural order
to the world.

29:25.650 --> 29:28.730
A way things are meant to be.

29:28.730 --> 29:33.480
Noah Fogel and Elijah Robinson
were interfering with that.

29:33.480 --> 29:39.390
The work they were doing,
trying to subvert nature...

29:40.270 --> 29:42.020
...it was depraved.

29:42.020 --> 29:45.390
I tried to warn them,
both of them,

29:45.390 --> 29:47.390
but they didn’t stop.

29:47.390 --> 29:49.560
So you stopped them?

29:49.560 --> 29:50.390
No.

29:50.390 --> 29:51.520
Wouldn’t be the first time

29:51.520 --> 29:53.350
you went after
scientists, Hugo.

29:53.350 --> 29:56.770
You did 23 months upstate
not long ago

29:56.770 --> 30:01.390
for sending fake anthrax
to stem cell researchers.

30:01.390 --> 30:02.730
We have video evidence

30:02.730 --> 30:05.350
that you knew where
Elijah Robinson lived.

30:05.350 --> 30:07.690
All that makes you
a pretty strong suspect.

30:07.690 --> 30:09.730
And in a way,
I’m flattered.

30:09.730 --> 30:11.650
It would make me a hero.

30:11.650 --> 30:13.390
But I didn’t do it.

30:13.390 --> 30:17.270
Elijah Robinson was beaten
to death Saturday before last.

30:17.270 --> 30:19.770
We know because he had
a grocery receipt in his pocket.

30:19.770 --> 30:23.900
Can you account for
your whereabouts on the 17th?

30:23.900 --> 30:26.690
Saturdays,
I always work a double shift.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.560
There are cameras
at the restaurant.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.270
If you check ’em, you’ll see.

30:31.270 --> 30:34.310
I didn’t kill anyone.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.770
(waves crashing)

30:48.310 --> 30:50.060
"When anxious, uneasy

30:50.060 --> 30:53.390
"and bad thoughts come,
I go to the sea,

30:53.390 --> 30:58.390
"and the sea drowns them out
with its great wide sounds,

30:58.390 --> 31:00.480
"cleanses me with its noise

31:00.480 --> 31:03.390
"and imposes a rhythm
upon everything in me

31:03.390 --> 31:07.390
that is bewildered
and confused."

31:07.940 --> 31:11.400
It’s also good for swimming.

31:12.390 --> 31:14.480
I was quoting
Rainer Maria Rilke,

31:14.480 --> 31:15.600
the German poet.

31:15.600 --> 31:17.650
He was consumed by
a need to understand

31:17.650 --> 31:20.230
the, uh, fundamental
essence of the world.

31:20.230 --> 31:22.400
And himself.

31:22.400 --> 31:26.270
Think I would’ve gotten on
quite well with him.

31:27.350 --> 31:29.810
Said you wanted to talk,
so talk.

31:29.810 --> 31:31.980
You said earlier that, um,

31:31.980 --> 31:35.230
you know, forgiveness
should be encouraged.

31:35.230 --> 31:37.400
Well, I’d ask
that you forgive me now.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.730
’Cause I went to see
your brother

31:39.730 --> 31:41.150
earlier on.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.650
I gave him the check
that I tried to give you.

31:43.650 --> 31:45.150
Sherlock, that’s not
what I wanted...

31:45.150 --> 31:47.390
No, I told him exactly
what I thought of him.

31:47.390 --> 31:48.390
That his treatment of you

31:48.390 --> 31:51.390
over the years
was reprehensible, and...

31:51.390 --> 31:53.730
and then I forgave him.

31:56.390 --> 31:57.690
How’d it feel?

31:57.690 --> 32:01.150
Well, it was more of a
practice run than anything else.

32:01.150 --> 32:02.150
What do you mean?

32:02.150 --> 32:05.020
I reached out
to this banker I know

32:05.020 --> 32:06.770
in the Cayman Islands.

32:06.770 --> 32:08.390
I’m reasonably sure that he’s

32:08.390 --> 32:10.390
facilitated Mycroft’s life
on the lam.

32:10.390 --> 32:13.560
And it might take
some time, but, uh,

32:13.560 --> 32:18.310
I think he can connect me
with Mycroft.

32:19.390 --> 32:21.390
You know, it’s hard
to pinpoint the exact moment

32:21.390 --> 32:25.390
that my resentment
towards my brother began.

32:25.390 --> 32:27.350
But if I had to bet, I’d say...

32:27.350 --> 32:31.390
sometime in the days or weeks
following my birth.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.940
He has this tremendous capacity
for joy,

32:36.940 --> 32:39.390
and I just...

32:43.390 --> 32:45.900
He has wronged me.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.810
But I-I will...

32:50.810 --> 32:53.560
I will forgive him.

32:54.600 --> 32:55.810
And then?

32:55.810 --> 32:59.940
Well, then perhaps
he’ll forgive me.

33:01.690 --> 33:05.770
And then I’ll have
my brother back.

33:15.230 --> 33:17.730
(footsteps approaching)

33:19.440 --> 33:22.390
You look repulsed,
and there’s tarragon in the air.

33:22.390 --> 33:23.440
Are you back on that cleanse?

33:23.440 --> 33:26.190
I like this tea.
I’m repulsed by this.

33:26.190 --> 33:27.390
I printed out a bunch of posts

33:27.390 --> 33:30.150
from Hugo Irving’s
favorite message boards.

33:30.150 --> 33:31.000
He hasn’t cracked yet?

33:31.040 --> 33:32.750
He’s not going to.

33:32.750 --> 33:33.700
His alibi checked out.

33:33.700 --> 33:34.990
But I read
the interview transcript,

33:34.990 --> 33:37.540
and he said something
to the captain and Marcus

33:37.540 --> 33:38.540
that made me think.

33:38.540 --> 33:39.410
He told them that killing Fogel

33:39.410 --> 33:42.000
and Robinson would
have made him a hero.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.500
Which made me wonder--
a hero to who?

33:43.500 --> 33:46.290
Who... who cheers a couple
of scientists getting killed?

33:46.290 --> 33:48.990
If such creatures exist,
surely they exist online.

33:48.990 --> 33:50.250
Hugo’s made tracks

33:50.250 --> 33:51.700
all over the Dark Web.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.700
Especially in a few
anti-science,

33:53.700 --> 33:54.990
fundamentalist chat rooms.

33:54.990 --> 33:56.990
So, you think we had
the wrong man

33:56.990 --> 33:57.990
but the right motive?

33:57.990 --> 33:59.870
It’s a worthy theory.

33:59.870 --> 34:00.950
I’ll help you test it.

34:00.950 --> 34:04.120
As long as you leave
that wretched brew behind.

34:07.700 --> 34:08.989
Watson.

34:08.989 --> 34:11.409
(gasps quietly)

34:11.409 --> 34:12.790
Oh, my God.

34:12.790 --> 34:13.989
Am I dreaming, or...

34:13.989 --> 34:16.870
did you just wake me up
with no theatrics?

34:16.870 --> 34:18.949
Well, you were quite
understanding of the extra sleep

34:18.949 --> 34:20.250
I required during my bout
with PCS.

34:20.250 --> 34:23.790
I thought I’d return
the favor... once.

34:23.790 --> 34:26.290
Mmm. What’s up?

34:26.290 --> 34:28.199
Plup.
Plup?

34:28.199 --> 34:31.750
After you went to bed,
I dug through the ramblings

34:31.750 --> 34:33.580
of several dozen
discussion board denizens,

34:33.580 --> 34:36.159
and I came across
a friend of Hugo’s

34:36.159 --> 34:38.040
who calls himself Plup.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.989
His posts were very troubling.

34:39.989 --> 34:41.040
How so?
Well, he knows things

34:41.040 --> 34:42.750
about the Galahad Prize
that he shouldn’t know.

34:42.750 --> 34:45.370
Names of the geneticists,
addresses of their laboratories,

34:45.370 --> 34:47.080
statistics
from their progress reports.

34:47.080 --> 34:50.250
And he’s been giving this
information out on the boards?

34:50.250 --> 34:51.449
Freely and abundantly.

34:51.449 --> 34:54.449
To Hugo, to various crackpots,

34:54.449 --> 34:56.909
offering all of them
sensitive data

34:56.909 --> 34:58.990
on those who chase
the Galahad Prize,

34:58.990 --> 35:01.950
and urging them to act on it
violently.

35:01.950 --> 35:04.160
Have a look for yourself.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.120
"You should pull
this guy’s eyes out

35:07.120 --> 35:09.040
and introduce them to his..."

35:09.040 --> 35:10.990
Sounds like Noah Fogel
got off easy

35:10.990 --> 35:13.660
swallowing thallium
and getting eaten by rats.

35:13.660 --> 35:16.000
The point is it was Plup

35:16.000 --> 35:18.990
who told Hugo
where to find Elijah Robinson.

35:18.990 --> 35:20.990
He was sabotaging
the competition.

35:20.990 --> 35:23.990
More precisely, he was provoking
others to do it for him.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.160
And when they failed to act,

35:25.160 --> 35:27.370
he took matters
into his own hands.

35:27.370 --> 35:29.200
Are you saying that Noah Fogel
and Elijah Robinson

35:29.200 --> 35:32.040
were killed by some anonymous
discussion board troll?

35:32.040 --> 35:35.120
Troll, yes. Anonymous, no.
Not anymore.

35:35.120 --> 35:37.990
The person who tried
to sabotage the Galahad Prize

35:37.990 --> 35:41.620
is one of the men
who organized it.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.270
This guy you went and
talked to the other day--

35:45.270 --> 35:46.890
you think he’s the killer?
Yeah.

35:46.890 --> 35:49.800
Hunter Becket killed Noah Fogel
and Elijah Robinson.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.890
But not for lack of trying
to delegate their deaths.

35:52.890 --> 35:54.690
WATSON: Hunter uses
the screen name Plup

35:54.690 --> 35:57.100
on fundamentalist
message boards.

35:57.100 --> 35:59.020
And most of the
people on there think

35:59.020 --> 36:01.150
that Western medicine
is an affront to God.

36:01.150 --> 36:03.400
So the idea that
someone would alter DNA

36:03.400 --> 36:05.440
to extend human
life, they would do

36:05.440 --> 36:06.890
almost anything
to stop that.

36:06.890 --> 36:10.310
Except, to their minimal credit,
murdering scientists.

36:10.310 --> 36:12.890
Now, you can see here
quite clearly

36:12.890 --> 36:14.890
that Hunter’s Plup
alter ego

36:14.890 --> 36:16.350
is trying to rally
these zealots

36:16.350 --> 36:18.310
into doing
his dirty work for him.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.890
When they balked,
he did it himself.

36:20.890 --> 36:22.890
What I can see
is this Plup guy

36:22.890 --> 36:24.440
has a lot of
sensitive information

36:24.440 --> 36:25.890
about the inner
workings of Galahad.

36:25.890 --> 36:28.890
How do you know he
wasn’t some hacker

36:28.890 --> 36:30.890
who broke
into their servers?

36:30.890 --> 36:32.900
Their servers
are nigh impenetrable.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.060
We reached out
to some hacker acquaintances.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.310
They didn’t see
how anyone

36:36.310 --> 36:37.980
could break
into Galahad’s network.

36:37.980 --> 36:39.890
Plup is a leaker, not a hacker.

36:39.890 --> 36:43.480
The Galahad Institute has,
what, 30 employees?

36:43.480 --> 36:46.230
What makes you so sure
Hunter’s our guy?

36:46.230 --> 36:48.890
Look at the time stamps
on the posts from Plup.

36:48.890 --> 36:53.600
Every one of them is between
4:30 and 5:00 in the morning.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.190
Yeah, he’s an early riser.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.230
Yep. Hunter Becket goes...

36:57.230 --> 37:00.690
sculling every morning
at sunrise on the Hudson.

37:00.690 --> 37:04.310
His social media posts are awash
with his rowing exploits.

37:04.310 --> 37:06.560
It’s not just the timing
of the messages

37:06.560 --> 37:07.600
that points to Hunter.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.810
It’s his motive also.

37:08.810 --> 37:12.100
If no one collects the prize,
he keeps the $5 million.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.890
But he’s the one
hosting the contest,

37:13.890 --> 37:15.890
and he’s already filthy rich.

37:15.890 --> 37:17.270
Not quite as well-off
as he once was.

37:17.270 --> 37:19.890
Before his father
drank the anti-aging Kool-Aid,

37:19.890 --> 37:21.440
Hunter was in line to inherit

37:21.440 --> 37:23.310
the Becket Medicated Powder
fortune.

37:23.310 --> 37:26.810
But then his father
emptied the family piggy bank

37:26.810 --> 37:27.730
into his institute.

37:27.730 --> 37:29.440
The old man still calls
all the shots.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.810
So now this guy’s
a trust fund brat

37:31.810 --> 37:32.890
with no trust fund.

37:32.890 --> 37:34.560
Mm-hmm. And much
as he would like to,

37:34.560 --> 37:37.890
Dudley Becket is not going
to beat death.

37:37.890 --> 37:41.270
When he dies, Hunter
will take control of Galahad,

37:41.270 --> 37:43.690
and then he can eliminate
the prize

37:43.690 --> 37:45.230
and reclaim his inheritance.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.890
Noah and Elijah
were getting close to doubling

37:46.890 --> 37:48.890
the life span of a rat,
so they had to go.

37:48.890 --> 37:51.020
GREGSON:
Even if you’re right,
we can’t arrest somebody

37:51.020 --> 37:53.940
for weird screen names
and their rowing schedule.

37:53.940 --> 37:57.890
Yeah, CSU didn’t find anything
useful at either crime scene,

37:57.890 --> 38:00.560
so how are we supposed
to nail this guy?

38:00.560 --> 38:04.020
Well, it’s funny
you should mention nails.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.890
This is a joke, right?

38:06.890 --> 38:08.890
I didn’t kill anyone.

38:08.890 --> 38:10.190
You didn’t want to,

38:10.190 --> 38:11.890
but Noah and Elijah
were getting close

38:11.890 --> 38:14.060
to taking a big bite out
of your inheritance.

38:14.060 --> 38:15.890
HOLMES: You’re not a
scientist, but you know

38:15.890 --> 38:17.350
a bit about powders--
thallium, for example.

38:17.350 --> 38:20.270
The first time you tried
to use it to poison someone

38:20.270 --> 38:21.650
didn’t go quite
according to plan.

38:21.650 --> 38:23.400
You were caught
in the act of trying

38:23.400 --> 38:24.600
to dose Elijah Robinson’s milk,

38:24.600 --> 38:26.890
so you hit him
with a rolling pin instead.

38:26.890 --> 38:30.560
Dr. Fogel’s murder
went much more smoothly.

38:31.560 --> 38:33.600
Dad, this is nonsense.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.520
BELL:
Is it?

38:34.520 --> 38:36.350
We identified
a chemical plant in Manila

38:36.350 --> 38:38.890
that does business
with Becket Medicated Powder.

38:38.890 --> 38:41.890
They process and store
elemental thallium.

38:41.890 --> 38:44.190
They’re going through
their shipping records for us.

38:44.190 --> 38:46.310
What are the odds you had
a package of thallium

38:46.310 --> 38:49.520
sent to yourself sometime
in the past couple months?

38:49.520 --> 38:51.310
No, this must be
some kind of mistake.

38:51.310 --> 38:54.890
No, I’m sorry, the only mistake
was made by him.

38:54.890 --> 38:56.270
The first time we met,
I couldn’t help

38:56.270 --> 38:58.400
but notice you kept picking
your fingernails all the way

38:58.400 --> 39:00.890
through our conversation. Two
of them were still bleeding.

39:00.890 --> 39:02.560
You’d obviously
just clipped them.

39:02.560 --> 39:03.650
I was wondering,

39:03.650 --> 39:05.100
why did he clip them so low?

39:05.100 --> 39:09.150
It was only when you became
a suspect that that made sense.

39:09.150 --> 39:11.230
We found a pigment
called Prussian blue

39:11.230 --> 39:12.900
on Elijah Robinson’s
kitchen counter.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.480
It’s an antidote for
thallium poisoning.

39:15.480 --> 39:17.890
You brought some with you
when you went to the house.

39:17.890 --> 39:20.310
We think you spilled it
when the two of you fought.

39:20.310 --> 39:21.890
HOLMES:
Anyone working
with thallium

39:21.890 --> 39:23.600
would keep Prussian
blue nearby.

39:23.600 --> 39:24.890
At some point during
your preparation

39:24.890 --> 39:26.810
to kill two people, you got it
under your fingernails.

39:26.810 --> 39:29.770
It was still there when we came
to talk to you the other day,

39:29.770 --> 39:33.940
so you clipped your nails
before you greeted us. Look.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.560
WATSON:
We found those in the trash.

39:39.400 --> 39:44.890
A DNA test will prove
they’re yours, won’t it?

39:44.890 --> 39:46.890
Son, is this true?

39:46.890 --> 39:49.600
Did you kill those men?

39:59.600 --> 40:01.890
WATSON:
Hey, I just heard
from Marcus.

40:01.890 --> 40:03.270
Hunter’s lawyers
are already talking

40:03.270 --> 40:06.230
to the D.A.
about making a plea deal.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.940
What’s happened?

40:11.440 --> 40:12.730
Uh...

40:12.730 --> 40:15.890
so, uh, yesterday,
I reached out to a...

40:15.890 --> 40:17.940
a banker in the Cayman Islands.

40:17.940 --> 40:22.890
I felt... I felt quite certain
that he’d be able to help me...

40:22.890 --> 40:26.480
locate Mycroft, and, uh...

40:26.480 --> 40:27.650
I was right.

40:27.650 --> 40:30.230
That’s great. Where is he?

40:32.480 --> 40:34.890
Leffen Trust Hospital?

40:34.890 --> 40:35.890
It’s in, uh...

40:35.890 --> 40:40.810
Timaru, on the east coast
of New Zealand.

40:47.890 --> 40:50.650
When did this happen?

40:51.100 --> 40:54.230
Uh, nearly ten months ago.

40:55.940 --> 41:00.980
Apparently, an intracranial
hemorrhage is, um...

41:00.980 --> 41:06.310
not unheard of in, uh,
leukemia survivors.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.600
They say it was,
uh, instantaneous.

41:10.600 --> 41:15.890
One minute, he-he was all right,
and the next minute, he wasn’t.

41:16.520 --> 41:22.520
So... he-he wouldn’t have
suffered before he died.

41:23.150 --> 41:25.350
He’s faked his death before.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.770
I mean, maybe...

41:26.770 --> 41:27.690
No.
