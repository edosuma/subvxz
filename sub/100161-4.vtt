Debts... gambling,
that sorta thing.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.660
Jesus.

18:43.013 --> 18:44.740
Sometimes I forget.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.206
- What?
- Well, my dad,

18:46.294 --> 18:47.989
what he came from.

18:48.270 --> 18:50.083
That he's a criminal.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.998
Mine was too.

18:52.086 --> 18:54.213
Just wasn't any fuckin'
good at it.

18:59.003 --> 19:00.673
Well...

19:01.276 --> 19:02.870
- you got the ask.
- Mm‐hmm.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.752
- Your call.
- Okay.

19:15.394 --> 19:17.813
Hey, Bridget,

19:17.990 --> 19:21.077
is there something that
I'm doing wrong, um, sexually?

19:21.362 --> 19:22.987
J‐just, um,

19:23.331 --> 19:25.604
just tell me what you need,
and...

19:26.604 --> 19:29.229
No, you're not... you're not
doing anything wrong.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.157
- Come on.
- Hm.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.626
All right.

19:41.104 --> 19:43.165
- Sorry.
- You're disgusting!

19:44.588 --> 19:45.963
Jonathan?

19:46.158 --> 19:49.329
- Jonathan!
- <i>Leave me alone.</i>

19:49.417 --> 19:51.182
- Open the door.
<i>- Fuck off!</i>

19:57.438 --> 20:00.858
- This is Smitty.
- So?

20:00.942 --> 20:03.736
So he's you today,
and you're him.

20:16.444 --> 20:17.945
They're taking
my money!

20:18.084 --> 20:20.419
We used to pay 500
for a three‐bedroom.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.513
I know!

20:23.884 --> 20:26.136
- It's criminal.
- Mm.

20:26.423 --> 20:29.843
The ad for my rental said
"ocean view."

20:29.931 --> 20:33.438
Sweetheart, we're paying
5,000 for a three‐bedroom.

20:33.541 --> 20:35.171
One of these bedrooms
is so small,

20:35.259 --> 20:38.118
Stuart can't even turn
his dildo horizontal.

20:38.282 --> 20:40.715
The point is,
there's no accountability

20:40.798 --> 20:42.882
at these Beachbnb places.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.348
It's like
the Wild fucking West.

20:45.548 --> 20:48.055
And we're the Indians.

20:54.854 --> 20:58.065
Ah, shit.

20:58.149 --> 20:59.775
Oy.

20:59.863 --> 21:01.281
Hello?

21:02.478 --> 21:04.938
It's me... Mick.

21:05.281 --> 21:07.621
<i>How are the Maldives?</i>

21:08.145 --> 21:09.971
Oh, I wouldn't know, honey.

21:10.059 --> 21:14.165
I'm out here in Rose Beach,
nice little gay community.

21:14.248 --> 21:16.596
Ooh! I like it there.

21:16.684 --> 21:18.699
Those men are so sturdy!

21:18.787 --> 21:21.392
Listen, I got an idea.

21:22.082 --> 21:24.050
You know this thing,
Beachbnb?

21:24.241 --> 21:26.291
- What?
- <i>People wire money</i>

21:26.379 --> 21:27.697
<i>to rent a beach house.</i>

21:27.785 --> 21:30.174
So I figure we can take
a picture of any house we want,

21:30.262 --> 21:33.150
pretend it's ours, take some
rich suckers for a ride.

21:33.238 --> 21:36.228
Okay.
I'll come.

21:36.312 --> 21:38.541
Besides, I got a new
bathing suit

21:38.629 --> 21:40.980
that needs to make its debut.

21:41.275 --> 21:43.238
Oh, I can hardly wait.

21:59.924 --> 22:02.963
Hey, maybe you shouldn't be
wearing my clothes.

22:03.150 --> 22:05.166
Oh?
Why's that?

22:05.306 --> 22:07.600
Well, what if
they're contagious?

22:08.944 --> 22:10.846
I don't think it works
like that.

22:18.933 --> 22:20.932
Hey, uh, Bridget?

22:21.697 --> 22:24.408
Hey, Bridget, you can't
get herpes from clothes?

22:24.519 --> 22:26.021
Right.

22:43.078 --> 22:44.955
Last night was a mistake.

22:45.147 --> 22:47.305
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

22:47.393 --> 22:49.197
- I don't think so.
- It can't happen again.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.453
'Kay.

22:50.720 --> 22:52.072
It won't.

22:55.309 --> 22:56.939
Look like a fucking idiot.

22:59.937 --> 23:01.605
Okay, here.

23:01.781 --> 23:02.963
Put this on.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.393
Oh, God!

23:16.996 --> 23:19.165
<i>Multiple anonymous
social media accounts</i>

23:33.035 --> 23:34.425

23:34.512 --> 23:36.056
<i>Move!

- Come on, get in.

23:48.402 --> 23:50.529
Go, go!

23:59.658 --> 24:00.846
<i>It's Terry.</i>

24:01.066 --> 24:02.611
I know.

24:21.939 --> 24:23.914
Liberty tells me
you're going home.

24:24.002 --> 24:26.283
Yeah.
I expected to feel different,

24:26.371 --> 24:30.000
but I just feel the same,
but... here.

24:30.767 --> 24:31.935
Terry...

24:32.736 --> 24:36.080
do you think the caterpillar
hopes to become a butterfly?

24:37.904 --> 24:39.364
Do I think the c...

24:40.962 --> 24:42.338
I don... I...

24:42.493 --> 24:44.370
- I dunno.
- He doesn't.

24:45.260 --> 24:47.729
He's just a caterpillar
being a caterpillar.

24:47.824 --> 24:49.304
And if he spent all his time

24:49.392 --> 24:51.502
hoping to become a butterfly
sooner,

24:51.650 --> 24:53.467
he would just be
wasting his time.

24:53.955 --> 24:56.322
Oh, what, I'm...
I'm the caterpillar?

24:56.410 --> 24:57.995
Terry...

24:58.305 --> 24:59.849
on that bookcase behind me

24:59.932 --> 25:04.019
take down that big grimoire
in the middle on runes.

25:09.977 --> 25:11.520
Sure.

25:19.631 --> 25:21.299
Open it.

25:25.936 --> 25:28.447
So... what, a...

25:29.132 --> 25:30.509
all this supposed...

25:30.597 --> 25:32.244
supposed to be magic
or something?

25:32.453 --> 25:34.288
Turn to the front page.

25:37.553 --> 25:39.816
"To Jerry Goldberg...

25:40.045 --> 25:43.128
all the best, Simon Conway."

25:43.621 --> 25:45.105
That was me.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.073
What, Jerry Goldberg,
that's you?

25:52.443 --> 25:54.904
Jerry Goldberg
was my caterpillar.

25:59.033 --> 26:01.527
Ah.

26:01.702 --> 26:06.624
Ohm...

26:06.853 --> 26:09.613
Ah.

26:10.425 --> 26:12.796
Ohm...

26:13.308 --> 26:15.215
Fuck.

26:15.768 --> 26:17.098
Ah.

26:17.831 --> 26:22.056
Ohm...

26:22.139 --> 26:24.777
Ah.

I heard that you met
with the Shaman.

28:09.824 --> 28:11.824
Jerry... Goldberg.

28:13.074 --> 28:16.972
I was hoping for
something different too.

28:17.171 --> 28:20.941
But that's the problem
in hoping, right?

28:22.211 --> 28:26.424
I mean, I...
I've tried everything.

28:26.640 --> 28:29.685
The operations.
The chemo.

28:29.933 --> 28:33.771
I paid $5,000
for some purple poultice

28:33.854 --> 28:36.482
to soak my feet in.

28:36.565 --> 28:39.443
You know
what I got from that?

28:40.097 --> 28:41.644
Purple feet?

28:46.005 --> 28:47.753
So...

28:48.115 --> 28:50.089
stones in your pockets.

28:50.339 --> 28:51.830
Are you a collector?

28:53.933 --> 28:56.456
No, it's... Truth‐truth is...

28:56.649 --> 28:59.472
noth... nothin' doesn't seem
to work no more.

29:00.105 --> 29:03.759
Not my hands, not my mind...

29:05.740 --> 29:07.714
My dick.

29:09.660 --> 29:12.144
And I know where all‐a...

29:12.754 --> 29:14.380
this is heading.

29:15.623 --> 29:18.316
And you truly think
that it would be better

29:18.404 --> 29:21.824
if you walked into the lake
and sank to the bottom?

29:22.063 --> 29:24.650
I dunno.
Maybe.

29:24.941 --> 29:27.214
What would you have missed
if you did?

29:30.077 --> 29:31.277
Not much.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.480
You cannot mean that.

29:58.886 --> 30:00.512
Ray.

30:01.650 --> 30:02.985
Fuck is goin' on, Tommy?

30:03.073 --> 30:05.415
Some very cool goings‐on
and shit here this week.

30:05.503 --> 30:06.832
We're doing a pop‐up
right here,

30:06.920 --> 30:08.652
relaunching the tequila,
re‐branding.

30:08.824 --> 30:10.900
Fuckin' gonna go
Casa Amigos on this shit.

30:10.988 --> 30:12.703
It is gonna be
fire!

30:12.786 --> 30:14.362
Fuckin' phone call
woulda been nice, Tommy.

30:14.449 --> 30:16.728
No, no, Ray, Ray, you just
keep on keepin' on.

30:16.816 --> 30:17.958
This won't affect
your shit at all.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.252
We'll just make sure
we stay out here

30:19.339 --> 30:22.777
so you can continue with your
covert operations.

30:25.354 --> 30:27.019
It's really good
to see Bridget.

30:27.113 --> 30:29.449
- What?
- Bridget.

30:29.668 --> 30:31.930
- She's all grown up now.
- Bridget.

30:32.386 --> 30:34.214
Yeah, she's in there
with a bunch of people.

30:38.472 --> 30:39.862
I mean,
at first I thought it was

30:39.949 --> 30:41.536
- just poison ivy, right?
- Poison ivy?

30:41.623 --> 30:42.817
- Th‐that's an angle.
- Yeah, yeah, I‐I...

30:42.904 --> 30:45.511
- What are you talking about?
- It is not an angle!

30:45.599 --> 30:48.602
Next idea.

30:48.989 --> 30:50.157
Let's go in.

30:53.027 --> 30:54.918
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

30:56.538 --> 30:58.749
The hell's
going on here?

30:59.707 --> 31:02.298
Adam needed help.
Jonathan was stuck inside

31:02.386 --> 31:04.296
with all these
press people outside.

31:10.769 --> 31:12.554
How'd you get him out?

31:12.988 --> 31:14.876
I had Smitty dress up
like Jonathan

31:14.964 --> 31:16.668
and Jonathan like Smitty.

31:21.855 --> 31:23.957
I told them to have Jonathan...

31:24.045 --> 31:25.285
put out a statement.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.464
Get in front of it.

31:29.449 --> 31:32.157
Is that the...
right thing to do?

31:32.638 --> 31:33.638
Yeah.

31:34.535 --> 31:36.128
It is, actually.

31:38.965 --> 31:40.550
Cool.

31:45.080 --> 31:47.291
Hispies.

31:48.058 --> 31:49.988
Call it hispies.

31:50.892 --> 31:53.236
I mean, herpes... sexist.

31:53.324 --> 31:55.806
Right?
Hispies.

31:56.378 --> 31:58.189
Hey, that's pretty
fucking good.

31:58.277 --> 32:00.310
Yeah, hispies!

32:01.520 --> 32:04.731
Hispies.

32:05.621 --> 32:07.498
What do you
think of that, Bridget?

32:07.599 --> 32:09.350
- Very good.
- It is.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.347
That's so genius!

32:15.840 --> 32:18.002
Can I come in?

32:20.314 --> 32:22.324
So I talked to my father.

32:23.472 --> 32:27.295
This is to box 44 at the
First Central Savings Bank.

32:27.855 --> 32:30.519
He said to take out
the brown leather bag.

32:32.318 --> 32:33.918
He said you'd understand.

32:34.441 --> 32:36.736
Well, 'cause I‐I told him
that I'd do it myself,

32:36.824 --> 32:37.889
but he won't let me.

32:37.973 --> 32:40.559
Chances are, whoever goes
in that vault triggers a call.

32:40.642 --> 32:42.478
- To who?
- The FBI,

32:42.566 --> 32:44.855
the U. S. Attorney's office,
maybe worse.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.848
Well, I can't ask you
to do that.

32:48.402 --> 32:50.918
Tell your father
I'll get what he needs.

33:10.839 --> 33:12.605
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Sandy.

33:40.449 --> 33:41.653

33:41.870 --> 33:44.699
Uh, your mother says
you might be comin' home.

33:45.468 --> 33:46.845
Yeah, um...

33:47.179 --> 33:48.908
I‐I‐I don't know, Allan.

33:48.996 --> 33:51.470
I guess I could definitely
find a spot for you

33:51.558 --> 33:52.878
in my company.

33:52.966 --> 33:56.011
Ha ha, right.
What, I‐in the mail room?

33:57.007 --> 33:59.050
Uh, you'd be
creative executive.

33:59.560 --> 34:00.955
Hmm?

34:01.043 --> 34:03.285
<i>Salary starts

34:26.206 --> 34:28.083
<i>Hey, uh, Allan, let me, uh,</i>

34:28.166 --> 34:31.253
think about the offer
and give you a call back, 'kay?

34:54.632 --> 34:56.027
May I help you?

34:56.110 --> 34:57.821

34:58.161 --> 35:00.194
- I got a key.
- Of course.

35:00.282 --> 35:02.157
Right this way.

35:10.454 --> 35:11.621
