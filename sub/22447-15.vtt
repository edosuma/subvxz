00:04.290 --> 00:05.880
-Andi: Previously,
on Andi Mack...
-Aah.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.710
I just went into The Fringe
to get something that made me
think of you.

00:07.710 --> 00:10.500
Some people
just aren't good
at giving presents.

00:10.500 --> 00:13.330
That was the wrong present,
but this... is the right one.

00:13.330 --> 00:17.170
-What is it?
-It's a piece of rice,
with your name on it.

00:17.170 --> 00:20.460
-See?
-You have to stop
buying me presents.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.420
Sorry, I'm just
trying to be a good boyfriend.

00:22.420 --> 00:26.040
-Jonah, you're not
my boyfriend.
-I want the label.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.620
But now... I don't know
if I want it.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.330
I'm moving.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.790
How soon do you have
to leave?

00:32.790 --> 00:34.460
We're leaving
in 10 days.

00:34.460 --> 00:36.500
They're must be
something we can do.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
You can stay
in my bedroom.

00:38.500 --> 00:42.040
(scoffs) There isn't
really enough room, is there?

00:42.040 --> 00:43.540
My old bedroom.

00:43.540 --> 00:45.960
And I think that this
is a wonderful home.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.500
But, baby,
I don't want to let you go.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.710
I don't want to let
you go, either.

00:50.710 --> 00:52.080
Buffy:
I'm sorry, guys.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.460
Come on, guys, think,
we only have a week left
with each other.

01:00.460 --> 01:04.670
I know... (sighs)
I don't want to think
about it.

01:04.670 --> 01:07.120
It's the world's
saddest countdown.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.960
And at the end,
we launch Buffy.

01:08.960 --> 01:12.540
Which is why we need to make
every last day epic.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.580
We don't wanna spend
what little time we have left
with each other

01:14.580 --> 01:17.000
doing the same thing
we always do--

01:17.000 --> 01:19.540
sitting at The Spoon
and having baby taters.

01:19.540 --> 01:22.080
But it's hard to think
of an epic day.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.580
The best days we've
ever had together...

01:24.580 --> 01:26.540
have just kind of
happened by accident.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.920
That's it.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.250
What is?

01:30.250 --> 01:33.540
You can't just create
an epic day out of thin air.

01:33.540 --> 01:36.120
So let's recreate one
that we've already had.

01:36.120 --> 01:37.420
Our Perfect Day.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.460
Great idea.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.420
What day was that again?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.790
Oh!

01:45.790 --> 01:48.170
Remember when we went
on that bike ride
a few years ago?

01:48.170 --> 01:51.170
It was the day that
we discovered the Alpine Slide?

01:51.170 --> 01:54.830
-Oh, the Alpine Slide.
-Oh, and on the way,
we found that shop

01:54.830 --> 01:57.120
with the hot apple cider
and the pumpkin donuts?

01:57.120 --> 01:58.670
The pumpkin donuts.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.500
Let's do it again, today.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.330
-Yes.
-Do what again?

02:02.330 --> 02:04.080
Uh, wait a second,
before you eat.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.750
These three,
they're still too hot
or still need to thaw.

02:08.170 --> 02:12.620
Get this: we are going
to recreate our Perfect Day.

02:12.620 --> 02:14.170
Oh.

02:14.170 --> 02:16.000
"Oh"?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.500
That's all my brilliant idea
gets is "Oh"?

02:19.500 --> 02:22.710
Well, in my experience,
you can't recreate
the perfect day.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.120
Why not?

02:25.120 --> 02:27.620
I guess it's just never
as good as the memory.

02:27.620 --> 02:30.250
It's like...
bringing home leftovers.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.670
You're never gonna love it
as much as you did
at the restaurant.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.750
It's always just gonna be
reheated meat.

02:34.750 --> 02:38.500
No. You're wrong,
you have to be.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.500
We have not had
our last great day together.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.580
Come on, guys,
we can do this.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.120
Today will not be
reheated meat.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.750
It's a weird rallying cry,

02:48.750 --> 02:51.380
but... I'm on board.

02:52.540 --> 02:53.620

I haven't ridden

03:57.250 --> 03:59.000
Me, neither.
But at least mine

03:59.000 --> 04:01.710
didn't have to time travel
here from the '60s.

My dad taught me
everything he knew.

08:57.920 --> 09:01.710
-Was he a good musician?
-No. Horrible.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.290
He only knew three chords.

09:03.290 --> 09:05.620
But he taught them to me,

09:05.620 --> 09:07.960
so they're still my favorites.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.040
Here, I'll show you.

23:47.120 --> 23:48.330
Why not?

23:48.330 --> 23:49.920
We just had our first big fight

23:49.920 --> 23:51.170
as mother and daughter.

23:51.170 --> 23:54.000
We're still having
our first big fight.

23:54.000 --> 23:57.040
Let's play the game
that shall not be named.

23:57.040 --> 23:59.420
That game is toxic.

23:59.420 --> 24:01.960
You two have an alliance.

24:01.960 --> 24:03.620
No!
