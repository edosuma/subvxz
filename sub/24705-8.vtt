WEBVTT

00:27.444 --> 00:29.654
The super says
Hernandez's apartment is facing the rear.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.531
Okay, you guys cover
the rear fire escape, all right?

00:31.531 --> 00:33.241
- Got it.
- Martinez, grab this for me.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.326
- Okay.
- When you're up there, cuff him.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.954
You're under arrest for armed robbery.
Nothing about the Simmons shooting.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.080
- Understand?
- Right.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.751
Nothin' how a fireman workin' two jobs
to make ends meet gets shot in the face

00:42.751 --> 00:44.502
for 12 dollars and 85 cents.

00:44.502 --> 00:46.796
You know who son is, right?
He's a cop at the one-five.

00:46.796 --> 00:49.174
- Yeah, Donny. He's a good cop.
- Okay, here we go.

01:04.814 --> 01:07.233
Police! Hit it.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.818
Police! Don't move!

01:08.818 --> 01:10.612
Let me see your hands!
Let me see your hands!

01:10.737 --> 01:12.864
- Let's go! Hands!
- Check the bathroom!

01:13.239 --> 01:15.241
- What the hell is goin' on?
- Yeah, what's this, man?

01:15.241 --> 01:17.327
Nothin' we can't talk
about down at the station.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.245
Can I at least get my robe?

01:19.245 --> 01:20.789
Yo, man, what'd I do? What's the charge?

01:21.206 --> 01:22.874
- Go ahead, Martinez.
- You're under arrest

01:22.874 --> 01:24.459
- for armed robbery.
- Oh, yeah?

01:24.626 --> 01:26.211
- Watch her!
- Hey! Hey!

01:26.211 --> 01:27.712
- Luis! Luis!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:27.712 --> 01:28.671
Andy! Get him!

01:28.797 --> 01:30.381
- Come here! Come here!
- Andy!

01:32.258 --> 01:34.844
Right there, freeze!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:35.220 --> 01:38.098
Let me drop-kick
this asshole right through the window!

01:38.098 --> 01:39.224
By the numbers, Andy.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.851
- By the numbers.
- All right. Yeah, okay, by the numbers.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.686
Which is lucky for you, dick-head,

01:43.812 --> 01:47.273
otherwise your nuts would be sayin',
Good-bye, Johnson, hello, eyeballs.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.859
Let's go, nature boy.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.937
One-five, Allen here.

03:09.397 --> 03:10.940
- James.
- Yeah, Detective?

03:13.359 --> 03:15.195
You know what? Next time,

03:15.195 --> 03:17.405
to avoid problems, don't give up
the charge until you've got

03:17.405 --> 03:19.782
the guy cuffed, okay?
Because a guy like this hears

03:19.908 --> 03:22.285
four counts of armed robbery,
he's here in his 15 years,

03:22.452 --> 03:24.495
he's thinkin', "Maybe I should
get out of here," you know?

03:24.495 --> 03:26.789
- Right, I got you. It won't happen again.
- All right. Good work.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.000
- John.
- Hey, Donny.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.755
- I heard you got the guy who shot my dad.
- Yeah, we got a suspect. A good one.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.591
- That's him?
- Yeah.

03:38.843 --> 03:42.472
You want a confession, John?
Give me five minutes alone with him.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.724
I know what you're thinkin'.
I'd be feelin' the same way.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.184
Now you've had... Donny...

03:47.268 --> 03:48.311
You've had your look.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.813
Now, go back downstairs,
and let me do my job, okay?

03:51.064 --> 03:52.440
I'm gonna take care of this.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.609
Yeah.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.027
All right. Go ahead.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.320
Okay.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.113
I have to ask you
a few questions.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.201
Kelly. You and Sipowicz.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.341
Isn't that the guy we like
on the Simmons shooting?

04:18.466 --> 04:21.552
Yeah, Luis Hernandez, the illustrated man.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.222
All he thinks we want him
on are the four robberies

04:24.222 --> 04:26.391
- Conklin was workin'.
- And I don't wanna spook him,

04:26.391 --> 04:28.476
'cause if I can get him to go
for the Conklin's robberies,

04:28.601 --> 04:30.019
then I can tie him to the Roberts case.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.230
And that'll give you
the same MO as the Simmons homicide.

04:32.230 --> 04:34.023
- Yeah.
- (CLEARS THROAT) Uh...

04:34.774 --> 04:37.277
what about the, uh, topless bar
undercover, Lieutenant?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.361
I thought I'd reassign it.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.447
Well, uh,
you think that's necessary, um...

04:41.864 --> 04:44.701
Kelly's gonna work interrogation
with Conklin and Roberts.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.870
He's gonna be schoolin' Martinez.
I'd just be like, uh, a fifth wheel.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.790
So, you'd prefer to stay
on the topless assignment?

04:51.082 --> 04:54.335
Well, I think that's the most bang
for our law enforcement buck,

04:54.460 --> 04:56.629
- manpower-wise.
- Take Medavoy.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.424
Yes, sir.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.183
We go in, we patronize,

05:09.392 --> 05:12.228
we see if the girls are offering anything
that isn't on the menu, huh?

05:12.228 --> 05:15.023
Kind of like a busman's holiday for me.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.193
Objective's to squeeze the owner,
who's laundering money for Tony Rago.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.740
- Yeah, uh, listen... ...Andy.
- Yes, Medavoy,

05:23.740 --> 05:26.117
you will be seein' naked broads.
You gonna have a problem with that?

05:26.242 --> 05:30.455
Uh, no, no. Um, I just, uh...
I... I wanted to tell you

05:30.455 --> 05:32.707
that, uh,
I'm... I'm glad we have this, uh,

05:32.707 --> 05:35.001
this, uh, opportunity to,
uh, to work together.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.003
Yeah, likewise. Let's go.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.380
Yeah, listen, there's something we,
uh, we have to discuss first.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.050
- What's that?
- Um, well...

05:42.550 --> 05:45.178
- I've been, uh, talking to a physician.
- Uh-huh.

05:45.553 --> 05:48.848
Actually, he's a shrink.
About my...

05:49.057 --> 05:50.391
Today, Medavoy, huh?

05:51.100 --> 05:52.685
Look, I wanna work with you, Andy.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.939
- It's just, you make me feel very anxious.
- Yeah? How?

05:57.231 --> 05:59.025
How do I make you feel, uh, anxious?

06:00.234 --> 06:01.819
That. Just like that.

06:03.237 --> 06:04.781
You invade my critical distance.

06:05.114 --> 06:07.367
- Your critical distance?
- Yeah.

06:07.825 --> 06:10.703
My doctor says that,
uh, every animal species

06:10.828 --> 06:14.040
that, uh, if you get too close,
they... they feel threatened.

06:14.248 --> 06:16.167
- Hmm.
- He's says that for humans,

06:16.501 --> 06:18.628
our critical distance is, uh, 18 inches.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.463
So, uh,
what are we supposed to do, Medavoy?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.925
- Send faxes to each other, hmm?
- Uh, no. No. No.

06:25.134 --> 06:29.013
I think that, uh, that now
we... we realize the problem.

06:29.180 --> 06:32.058
Yeah, okay, sure. We'll work on it.

06:37.105 --> 06:40.191
- How do you pronounce your name?
- Ah-bon-don-do.

06:40.358 --> 06:43.361
- Abandando. Donna.
- Right.

06:43.611 --> 06:47.407
Well, Donna, we're delighted you're here.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.992
We've been waiting three months
for your position to open up.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.704
Oh, me too. I've been temping
the whole time,

06:53.871 --> 06:56.582
so I could start as soon
as the funding came through.

06:57.083 --> 07:00.128
Are you familiar with the origins
of the safe streets program?

07:00.753 --> 07:02.880
It was designed to bring in
people like yourself

07:03.047 --> 07:06.008
to relieve cops of a lot
of their administrative and clerical load.

07:06.134 --> 07:09.303
Yes, I know.
It sounds like such a smart idea.

07:12.181 --> 07:14.684
- You all right?
- It... It's a very important job.

07:15.226 --> 07:18.646
Someone like you
can really be uplifting to morale.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.857
That'd make me feel great.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.483
Donna, um,

07:23.443 --> 07:27.029
working in this environment,
you got no problem with that?

07:27.655 --> 07:31.075
- What do you mean?
- Well, it's predominantly male.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.369
And, um,

07:34.203 --> 07:36.247
I guess that's what I'm talking about.

07:36.372 --> 07:39.959
- That it's predominantly male.
- I know that.

07:41.085 --> 07:42.545
That won't be a distraction?

07:43.129 --> 07:45.298
No, I don't think so.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.217
All right.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.012
All right, then.
Let me show you to your desk.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.558
We'll situate you right across
from the catching bench.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.642
Do you know what that is?

07:56.642 --> 08:01.272
Where civilians wait to speak
with detectives about their cases.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.191
Very good.

08:03.399 --> 08:06.402
- What happened to Comiskey?
- A little squad room traffic accident,

08:06.527 --> 08:07.820
- Lieutenant.
- What happened?

08:08.029 --> 08:09.989
Well, he seems to have
fractured his nose, sir.

08:11.407 --> 08:12.408
That's yours.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.120
See Connie Imperial downstairs
for your materials.

08:16.621 --> 08:20.666
Lieutenant, is there a policy
on displaying personal collectibles?

08:21.375 --> 08:24.462
Plants, memorabilia in the immediate area
of your desk, that's all fine.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.672
Connie will show you
where to put your things after your shift.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.884
Good, 'cause I'd hate to lose this.

08:30.384 --> 08:31.427
Do you like hockey?

08:31.719 --> 08:32.970
I'm not a huge fan.

08:32.970 --> 08:37.558
This is autographed
by Brian Leach and Mark Messier.

08:39.060 --> 08:40.228
That's great.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.272
- Anyway, Donna, welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.069
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.487
Do you understand?

08:50.112 --> 08:52.240
I don't need to understand
since I didn't do anything.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.450
Luis, listen to this. It's important.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.453
Anything you say, can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.330
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.707
Okay.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.085
Do you agree to proceed with questioning
without an attorney present?

09:04.460 --> 09:06.170
Sure. I got nothin' to hide.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.049
You may request an attorney at any time.
Do you understand?

09:10.174 --> 09:12.677
How many times are you gonna ask me that?
What, you think I'm like stupid?

09:13.010 --> 09:16.889
Okay, I think if we can all get along,
we can come out of this okay.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.059
Look, I don't have anything to come out of
because I didn't do anything.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.145
- You understand your rights?
- Yeah.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.648
Please, read over this statement
and sign at the bottom.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.358
It lists all the rights I just spoke of

09:27.358 --> 09:29.986
that states that you were not coerced
into waiving those rights.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.949
Take your time.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.334
Your photograph
has been identified by a Nigerian

09:45.459 --> 09:48.087
robbed on October 14th last.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.798
He identified you as the perpetrator.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.136
You guys ain't been listenin', okay?
I'm not a thief, okay?

09:55.136 --> 09:58.139
I'm a baker's assistant.
I work at Rego Park Bakery.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.558
He picked you out
of a mug book that thick.

10:01.726 --> 10:04.353
Now, we can have that Nigerian back
in here to pick you out of a lineup,

10:04.937 --> 10:08.441
but between his ID and the fact
that the gloves you were seen wearing

10:08.733 --> 10:12.361
in your apartment, believe me,
that one you're goin' away on.

10:13.696 --> 10:17.158
Now, you wanna tell me about all those
other cab robberies you committed?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.368
Luis, we know the truth.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.039
The only question is,
how difficult are you gonna make it on us?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.291
Now, you make it easy,

10:26.083 --> 10:29.295
we can show you some
consideration, gratitude.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.340
We know you committed
these four robberies.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.843
We've talked for a while,
and obviously you're an intelligent guy.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.846
You got a job. You don't have anything
major on your record.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.848
So, let me tell you
how it's gonna go, okay?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.184
I think you're gonna like
what I have to offer.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.769
What you're offering? What's that?

10:44.935 --> 10:46.812
An all-expense-paid trip
to Puerto Rico, man?

10:47.229 --> 10:49.857
You confess to all four robberies,
they become one arrest.

10:50.358 --> 10:53.152
That saves us a lot of time.
Time on the investigation,

10:53.611 --> 10:57.657
time on the paperwork, lineups.
You save us a few days,

10:57.782 --> 10:59.950
I'll be in a position
to save you a few years.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.118
Wait a minute.

11:01.994 --> 11:03.704
I'm supposed to trust you guys?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.122
Facts are facts, right?

11:06.165 --> 11:09.335
One arrest equals one conviction
equals one bit in the joint.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.838
I can tell the DA,
and the judge you cooperated.

11:13.798 --> 11:18.094
You cop to all four of these robberies,
and I promise this will all happen.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.139
Yeah, but you still gotta prove
that I did all these.

11:22.348 --> 11:25.976
Have I insulted you yet?
Don't insult me, okay?

11:27.228 --> 11:29.271
You know you did 'em,
and we know you did 'em.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.192
Now, if you don't go for this,
you get tried four times,

11:33.192 --> 11:34.944
and you serve four sentences.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.030
Luis, these are cab robberies.
There's not violence.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.532
There's nothing heavy-duty here.

11:40.866 --> 11:42.410
Go for these four and that's it.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.330
- That's it?
- That's it. Over and out. Done deal.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.212
Okay, I'll go for the four robberies.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.925
Okay. Set up the videotape. Call the DA.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.844
Halfway to Puerto Rico.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.353
That's step one.

12:10.688 --> 12:14.066
Detective, I know I'm new to this,
but we got three witnesses

12:14.066 --> 12:15.651
who'll put Hernandez
right at the shooting.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.112
Why not charge him
with the murder right now? Why play games?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.990
Okay. Our witnesses place him
in the vicinity of the crimes

12:20.990 --> 12:23.743
around the time of death.
That's not gonna cut it. By trial time,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.620
witnesses disappear, they get sick,
they forget what they saw.

12:26.954 --> 12:30.082
We want the confession.
We get the confession, they never go away.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.334
- All right, right. Okay.
- I'll see you in there.

12:35.796 --> 12:40.551
The time is 11:18 a.m.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.470
My name is Randall Williams,

12:42.470 --> 12:44.764
assistant district attorney,
county of New York.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.850
Also present in the room
are Detective John Kelly,

12:47.975 --> 12:51.312
Detective Mike Conklin,
and Officer James Martinez.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.106
Could you each state your name,
and shield number, please.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.942
Detective John Kelly, shield 3118.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.863
Detective Mike Conklin, shield 1708.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.951
Police Officer James Martinez,
shield number 2205.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.663
Also present in the room
are videotape technician Greg Wing.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.750
and, finally, Mr. Luis Hernandez.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.251
- Is that correct?
- Yes, sir.

13:14.376 --> 13:16.253
Would you state your age,
please, Mr. Hernandez?

13:16.253 --> 13:17.922
- Twenty-eight.
- And where do you live?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.132
Uh, 635 Linden Boulevard.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.969
Mr. Hernandez, you've agreed
to tell us about several incidents,

13:23.969 --> 13:25.679
several cab robberies.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.723
At this time, I'd like to direct
your attention

13:27.723 --> 13:30.476
to the events
of October 14th of this year,

13:30.684 --> 13:33.521
your dealings with a cab driver,
named Christian Mfume.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.608
Just take your time, tell me everything
that happened from beginning to end.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.944
- Okay. Well, I got off work...
- What time was that?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.823
 I get off work at noon.

13:45.574 --> 13:48.369
I called the Liberty Cab Company
from the employee locker room.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.496
I told them to send one
to Green and Booker.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.668
That's the location
of the bakery you work at?

13:55.793 --> 13:57.086
Yeah. It's like a few blocks away.

13:57.711 --> 14:01.882
Uh, when the cab got there, I told him
to go to Reed Street in Manhattan.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.635
But he didn't know how
to get there, so I told him.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.720
You told Mr. Mfume, the driver?

14:07.054 --> 14:09.348
Yes. (CLICKS TONGUE) Uh,
he didn't know directions much,

14:09.348 --> 14:12.434
bein' that he was like,
uh, African or somethin'.

14:13.727 --> 14:16.063
- Then what happened?
- Uh...

14:17.648 --> 14:20.776
we got to Elmore Street.
I told him to pull into the alley.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.779
But he didn't want to,
so I showed him my gun,

14:23.779 --> 14:25.823
and I told him if he didn't,
somethin' bad would happen.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.033
- What kind of a gun was it?
- ...45.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.120
Uh...

14:32.288 --> 14:33.497
I showed him the gun,

14:33.914 --> 14:36.876
he drove into the alley,
and I told him, you know,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.961
"Give me your money, or I'll kill you."
Somethin' like that.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.547
I don't remember exactly because,
you know, the gun was just to scare him.

14:42.339 --> 14:45.509
- And then he gave me the money.
- How much money did he give you?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.555
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) ...72 dollars.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.475
Now, I told him to stay there
for ten minutes.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.936
"Don't call anybody on your radio
because I'll be watching."

14:56.186 --> 14:59.023
And, uh, I just ran through the subway,
'cause I knew there was a stop near there.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.152
Okay.
Now, I'd like to direct your attention

15:03.152 --> 15:06.947
to events on or about
October 18th of this year

15:06.947 --> 15:10.618
regarding a cab driver,
named Wendell McCoy.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.460
Hey, Laura! Welcome back.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.254
- Thanks.
- You sure you're ready to be here?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.381
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I need to get back to work.

15:24.715 --> 15:27.509
It's your call, Laura. I mean that.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.553
I know. Thank you.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.765
So, I can't believe
they dropped the Reyes case.

15:32.932 --> 15:36.852
Yeah. So ends my uninterrupted ascent
up the prosecutorial ladder.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.563
It was a great week.
Giardella gets wasted,

15:39.563 --> 15:41.899
and our other chief witness
develops memory-lapse.

15:41.899 --> 15:46.153
- Who do you think got to Perez?
- Probably kidnapped some relative in Lima.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.448
The truth is, outside the DA's office,

15:49.448 --> 15:51.659
no one cares about
these guys anyway, Laura.

15:51.784 --> 15:56.163
Read the papers. "Three Colombians.
Four dead coke mules from Peru."

15:56.497 --> 15:57.498
They got no faces.

15:58.207 --> 16:01.669
Giardella had us in the game,
stuff he was givin' us.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.797
You get to prosecute
a guy like Tommy Linardi, that's...

16:05.923 --> 16:07.716
profile, that's got some future.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.594
It's too bad Giardella's dead.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.096
Yeah.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.975
How long were you
alone with him before he died?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.601
Uh,

16:18.310 --> 16:20.270
- till the marshal came in.
- How long?

16:22.189 --> 16:25.234
Maybe 15 seconds.
The marshal was down the hallway.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.111
He was checking the maid's cleaning cart.

16:28.028 --> 16:29.196
You were alone

16:29.196 --> 16:31.991
with Giardella 15 seconds
after he was shot?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.159
Yeah. Why, Jimmy?

16:35.285 --> 16:36.912
'Cause if he spoke to you as he was dying,

16:36.912 --> 16:40.624
if he accused his killer,
that's an exclusion to the hearsay rule.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.003
- That'd be admissible in court.
- Except Giardella didn't say anything.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.673
He crawled to the door,
he reached his hand out to me,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.133
- and then he died.
- Laura, we know

16:49.133 --> 16:51.135
who was responsible for that murder.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.804
"If anything happens to me,
Linardi gave the order."

16:53.929 --> 16:56.015
How many times did Giardella tell us that?

16:56.432 --> 16:58.100
How many times do we have that on tape?

16:58.267 --> 16:59.518
But it's not admissible.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.272
A dying accusation this?

17:03.897 --> 17:05.941
Giardella didn't accuse anyone, Jimmy.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.694
People would understand
why you were reluctant to tell the police.

17:08.694 --> 17:12.239
There'd been indictments,
allegations cops were on the mob payroll.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.409
You even hesitated to tell me.
It's perfectly understandable.

17:15.826 --> 17:16.827
- Jimmy...
- Look!

17:17.911 --> 17:21.165
You were married to a cop six years.
I have a tough time believing

17:21.165 --> 17:23.792
your ex-husband never told you
about helping a case.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.211
When you didn't have a warrant,

17:26.211 --> 17:28.547
saying the perp asked you
into the apartment.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.507
Saying he came into the hall voluntarily.

17:30.507 --> 17:33.093
Saying you didn't beat him
to make him confess.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.888
No, Johnny never talked to me about that.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.893
Well, maybe it's about time
someone paid you the compliment

17:41.018 --> 17:42.519
of treating you like an adult.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.358
Obviously, it's your decision.
You're the one who was alone with the guy.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.280
You're the only one
who knows what happened.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.325
Why don't we talk later?

18:02.164 --> 18:05.501
<i>You're too bad</i>

18:05.626 --> 18:08.545
<i>Too bad for your own damn good</i>

18:09.296 --> 18:12.841
<i>Oh, you act just like you should</i>

18:14.009 --> 18:17.304
Yeah. Right.
What do you want from me?

18:17.846 --> 18:21.308
Did I give your kid cerebral palsy? No.

18:21.642 --> 18:24.478
Then his medical bills have nothing to do
with what you owe me.

18:24.978 --> 18:28.065
- Cherry soda.
- This guy ain't drinkin'?

18:28.607 --> 18:31.110
I want at least 30 on his tab,
or you're fired.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.444
Here you go.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.375
Whoo!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.252
<i>The devil will catch up with you</i>

18:48.252 --> 18:50.546
<i>And what you can't replace</i>

18:50.546 --> 18:54.967
<i>Well, the way you misbehave is criminal</i>

18:55.300 --> 19:00.264
<i>But it only makes me
Want you more and more</i>

19:00.973 --> 19:04.017
<i>You're too bad</i>

19:04.434 --> 19:06.436
<i>Too bad for your own damn good...</i>

19:08.355 --> 19:09.398
Thanks.

19:10.399 --> 19:15.112
<i>You're too bad
Too bad for your own damn good</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:16.613
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:17.030 --> 19:20.117
- I'm Monique. What's your name?
- Andy.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.369
<i>Too bad for your own damn good</i>

19:24.872 --> 19:25.998
Hi. I'm Ingrid.

19:27.833 --> 19:30.919
- Hi.
- Can I do a private dance for you?

19:32.921 --> 19:33.964
Yeah, sure.

19:47.311 --> 19:51.398
A-plus
in the tit department, Monique.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.068
Would you like to have
a touching party, Andy?

19:56.445 --> 19:58.614
I could get up
for any kind of a party.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.073
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.327
How about a licking party?

20:04.578 --> 20:06.413
An everything goes party?

20:08.332 --> 20:12.044
- How much would that cost me?
- I'll tell you in the back.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.923
<i>Too bad for your own damn good</i>

20:18.217 --> 20:21.345
- Do you like me?
- Oh, yes.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.599
<i>Too bad for your own damn good</i>

20:30.229 --> 20:31.438
Do you like these?

20:32.981 --> 20:35.275
Yes. Yes!

20:36.777 --> 20:40.113
Yeah.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.825
Okay. I can touch you for 50.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.912
- I can lick you for a hundred.
- Hmm.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.414
Lickin' sounds good.

20:49.665 --> 20:53.794
There you go. Okay. Yeah.

20:54.294 --> 20:56.838
Okay. All right, baby, let's see it.

20:57.005 --> 21:00.717
You don't know how sorry I am
to tell you this, Monique,

21:00.717 --> 21:02.970
but... ...you're busted.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.849
Hey, you, asshole! Come here. Come here.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.893
- Hey, what's goin' on here?
- You're under arrest.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.603
- For what?
- Promoting prostitution.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.147
Screw you! You got nothing on me,
and you're not doing anything

21:14.147 --> 21:16.650
- until I talk to my lawyer.
- Is that right, huh? What do you got?

21:16.942 --> 21:19.903
Solicitation.
And double billing on my cherry soda.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.613
I can't believe you're a cop.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.282
Why don't you go
do something useful?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.659
Anyone can tell you
there are muggings goin' on out there.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.953
- If you had anything to do with this...
- Oh, shut up, Frankie!

21:27.953 --> 21:29.913
Is that a threat, huh?
Are you threatening her?

21:30.163 --> 21:32.582
'Cause that's called obstructing
governmental administration.

21:32.582 --> 21:34.793
Now, you wanna be charged
with that too? Then shut up.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.213
Get her some clothes.
Call in uniform and shut this place down.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.339
Come on, asshole. Let's go.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.049
My lawyer's
gonna have a ball with this.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.175
Let's go.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.185
Who's this? I thought we were done.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.187
I'm Detective Roberts.

21:55.022 --> 21:58.317
I'm investigating a cab robbery
last October the 24th.

21:58.608 --> 22:01.611
The driver was robbed,
then his cab was taken,

22:01.611 --> 22:04.323
and abandoned
on the 700 block of Fletcher.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.158
Do you know anything about that?

22:09.536 --> 22:11.413
- I thought we were done.
- I thought so too.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.292
But then Detective Roberts here
shows me this new cab robbery file.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.046
What's goin' on, Luis? This is you.

22:19.629 --> 22:22.132
I don't know
what you're talkin' about. That ain't me.

22:22.257 --> 22:25.510
It's the same cab company,
same pickup area.

22:25.719 --> 22:28.472
No, man. I ain't goin' for this.
I thought we had a deal.

22:28.930 --> 22:32.142
This is not gonna work, Luis,
unless you are totally candid with me.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.978
I asked you
about all the cab robbery files,

22:34.978 --> 22:36.396
and now I'm lookin' through new ones.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.566
Look through all the files you want.
I didn't do this one. I'm done.

22:39.816 --> 22:41.443
This is definitely you.
Take a look at it.

22:41.651 --> 22:44.780
This is absolutely you.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.034
Hey, Luis, I'm tryin'
to give you another chance.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.454
You think I should have
a lawyer in here now?

22:54.122 --> 22:55.165
That's your call.

22:56.833 --> 22:59.086
If you want an attorney in here,
I'll get you an attorney in here.

22:59.086 --> 23:02.964
He's gonna tell you to shut up.
And then things will become adversarial.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.092
The deal's gone. Forget the deal.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.470
Is that what you want? Us against you?

23:09.763 --> 23:12.432
Knowin' what I know about you?
You want me against you?

23:12.557 --> 23:13.809
I don't think so.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.647
I want a cigarette.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.274
You want an attorney present?

23:26.571 --> 23:27.864
No, I just want a cigarette.

23:29.616 --> 23:32.077
Okay. Get the man a cigarette.

23:34.663 --> 23:35.664
Get him a few.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.058
Hey.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.352
Hi, Jimmy.

24:02.732 --> 24:04.443
You're about to drive me back to smoking.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.778
Don't. I don't need that on my conscience.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.614
Yeah, I'm having a few problems
in that area myself.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.993
Look, I hope you didn't get
the wrong impression

24:12.993 --> 24:14.703
from our conversation this morning.

24:15.537 --> 24:18.081
No, I didn't get
the wrong impression.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.168
You can say that it's only to help
a case we're sure about.

24:21.168 --> 24:22.919
We know Linardi killed Giardella.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.590
Underneath all the party wrapping,
you're still asking me to lie.

24:31.511 --> 24:34.389
You wouldn't be taping this
by any chance, would you, Laura?

24:35.182 --> 24:36.600
No, I'm not taping this.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.145
Wanna search me?

24:41.563 --> 24:42.564
Sorry.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.152
I haven't said
that I wouldn't be willing to help you.

24:47.527 --> 24:48.695
But I need to know the terms.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.032
Well, if you were to remember
that before he died,

24:52.032 --> 24:54.910
Giardella accused Linardi
or the shooter mentioned Linardi's name,

24:54.910 --> 24:56.536
that'd get us through grand jury.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.914
We'd explain you held back
'cause you were frightened,

24:59.039 --> 25:00.540
you didn't know who to trust
with the truth.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.543
Once the grand jury indicts,
we'd have subpoena power.

25:03.543 --> 25:06.671
We could also use our
taped conversations with Giardella.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.340
We'd be back in business, Laura.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.800
Talk to me about what happens
if I don't cooperate.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.387
We're friends.
We'd find a way to work it out.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.349
- Tell me how.
- Well, if you were more comfortable

25:17.349 --> 25:19.684
not working for me anymore,
that'd be okay.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.604
I mean, I know it might look
kind of awkward

25:22.604 --> 25:25.732
-'cause you changed jobs so recently.
- Yes, it would.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.985
It'd look like Laura's
job of the month club or something.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.572
You don't wanna give people
the impression of instability.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.411
Let me see if I get the picture here.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.541
If I want to stay, I have to remember

25:43.041 --> 25:47.295
Giardella accused Linardi before he died,
even though I know that's a lie.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.839
Otherwise, you'll have me
transferred from my job,

25:49.839 --> 25:51.299
and spread rumors that I'm unstable.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.553
You're putting things
in a pretty harsh light.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.304
But accurate.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.646
You lost one case.
Do you really need to succeed that much?

26:05.021 --> 26:07.524
What I don't need
is psychoanalysis from you.

26:09.025 --> 26:11.403
Okay. Food for thought.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.031
Which is no substitute
for actual lunch. Come on.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.743
No, thanks. I need to figure this out.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.745
Let me know what you decide.

26:23.832 --> 26:28.795
I hate what I'm doing.
I hate this. I wanna stop.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.755
Yeah, well, my experience is,

26:31.047 --> 26:32.924
the feeling will pass
as soon as you make bail.

26:32.924 --> 26:34.050
You wanna sit down over here?

26:36.678 --> 26:38.597
Do you know why I started
working at the club?

26:38.972 --> 26:40.765
Uh, to pay for college?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.269
Happens to be the truth.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.520
How long have you...

26:45.812 --> 26:48.732
You know, at first I thought
it was just gonna be for a while, but...

26:50.775 --> 26:54.613
Would it kill you
to believe me, to give me a break?

26:55.822 --> 26:57.657
Look, Monique, I got no beef with you.

26:58.074 --> 27:01.036
But if I let you walk,
your boss walks too.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.705
Think of yourself as,
uh, the friendly dolphin

27:03.913 --> 27:05.665
got caught in the shark net, huh?

27:06.082 --> 27:07.125
Current address?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.502
700 West 29th.

27:14.007 --> 27:16.134
How about if I help you nail Frankie?

27:17.927 --> 27:19.554
I'd say hooray, Monique.

27:20.263 --> 27:22.641
But, uh, wouldn't you be
buyin' yourself some grief?

27:23.808 --> 27:26.770
Doesn't make sense, does it?
Just to beat a 200 dollar fine?

27:27.937 --> 27:29.856
Maybe I really do want
to get out, huh, Detective?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.400
Yeah, maybe you do.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.489
All right, ball's in your court.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.659
We're a cash business.

27:41.576 --> 27:43.161
Do you think he declares all that cash?

27:43.745 --> 27:44.788
Probably not.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.457
I know
where his safety deposit boxes are.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.125
I can tell you the banks.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.922
Surprise, surprise, huh, Detective?

27:54.756 --> 27:57.926
- Let's get it right.
- I told you, I only did the four.

27:57.926 --> 28:01.221
Mm-hmm, Luis, did we
or did we not have a conversation

28:01.221 --> 28:03.723
about how good you were doin'
for yourself, huh?

28:03.848 --> 28:06.893
The four crimes combined,
the positive recommendation?

28:07.060 --> 28:10.438
Remember your whole support system?
Do you remember that? Bye-bye.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.858
All the details you gave us
on the first four, Luis,

28:13.858 --> 28:15.902
they put you right
in the middle of this thing.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.654
Hey.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.991
You are taking your chances
on this one, buddy, and I'll tell you why.

28:21.991 --> 28:24.828
Because if I have to pop you on this,
this is a whole separate deal.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.206
This is a whole new trial.
More time. Put 'em together.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.209
I didn't do that one.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.339
Okay. I want you to listen to me, okay?

28:36.673 --> 28:39.634
You got the one robbery.
You put it with the other four,

28:39.968 --> 28:43.555
and then you have an umbrella
under which to place all the five crimes.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.683
Do you understand?
No additional time, no new charges.

28:46.933 --> 28:48.727
Cops are just like anybody else.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.397
You make things easier for us,
we'll make things easier for you.

28:52.939 --> 28:55.024
- That's it.
- You hear about prison overcrowding?

28:55.150 --> 28:56.234
Anything under five years,

28:56.359 --> 28:58.111
they're lookin' for an excuse
to send you home.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.822
Anything over,
they're gonna find a place for you.

29:01.281 --> 29:02.490
So, put 'em together.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.706
Okay, let me tell you what's gonna happen
if you don't cooperate, Luis.

29:10.373 --> 29:13.126
My lieutenant is gonna have me look
into all the cab robberies

29:13.126 --> 29:14.377
in the last six months.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.505
And guess who do you think
he's gonna want me to connect them to?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.758
Who do you think? Huh?

29:20.216 --> 29:23.720
It's gonna take me
three or four days, but I'll do it.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.222
No, that don't make sense.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.977
Luis, you're probably feeling
like you're being jerked around,

29:31.227 --> 29:32.896
and I'm partially responsible for that.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.190
I should've looked
into more files before we talked.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.985
So, I'm gonna make it up to you.
I'm gonna sweeten the pot a little, okay?

29:39.402 --> 29:40.445
Right.

29:42.071 --> 29:43.990
Tell me how you feel
about the crimes you committed.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.703
Bad. I feel bad.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.540
And sittin' here, hearin' you say that,
I believe you are sincere.

29:52.665 --> 29:56.252
So, what I'm gonna do is, when you make
the second confession on tape,

29:56.252 --> 29:58.671
at the end of the tape,
I'm gonna allow you

29:59.130 --> 30:01.466
to make a statement
of remorse to the judge.

30:02.550 --> 30:04.719
That's important, Luis.
They want remorse.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.472
You got money problems.
You're desperate for money.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.433
You can't make your rent.
Right? That make sense?

30:12.644 --> 30:13.686
Think about it.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.487
So, after you bound
the driver's wrists with duct tape,

30:22.487 --> 30:24.781
and made him leave the cab,
then what did you do?

30:26.991 --> 30:28.701
I drove the cab to 24th Street

30:28.701 --> 30:30.662
'cause I knew
there was a subway stop near there.

30:33.206 --> 30:35.667
I counted the money.

30:36.251 --> 30:37.335
There was, um...

30:38.628 --> 30:42.382
Fifty-five... no, 58 dollars.

30:44.717 --> 30:47.762
- And then I just left the cab.
- You took the subway home?

30:48.805 --> 30:49.806
Yeah.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.227
- Now?
- Yeah, go ahead.

30:57.730 --> 31:00.650
I just wanna say I'm very sorry
for doin' these robberies.

31:01.901 --> 31:03.152
I know that they were wrong.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.532
I didn't use the money for drugs
or any illegal things.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.160
Uh, these are
the only crimes I've ever done.

31:15.331 --> 31:16.332
You're the man.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.961
Nice job.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.880
Hurry it up down there.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.049
- Detective Sipowicz.
- Yeah?

31:25.633 --> 31:28.887
I don't care if you embarrass yourself
but don't embarrass me.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.848
Excuse me, Counselor. I, uh,
I'm not sure I'm taking your drift.

31:32.140 --> 31:35.435
I've just come from an interview
with your arrestee, Frank Cantor,

31:35.852 --> 31:39.355
whose two favorite words in regard to you
are asshole and entrapment.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.025
- What exactly did he say?
- For openers?

31:42.525 --> 31:45.111
That you solicited a sex act
from one of his employees.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.947
That you took her into a back room,
offered to pay her 100 dollars,

31:48.072 --> 31:50.658
and never identified yourself
as a police officer

31:50.783 --> 31:53.912
until after you had quote,
"Taken her for a test drive

31:53.912 --> 31:57.290
- around the block." End quote.
- First of all, ADA Costas,

31:57.290 --> 32:00.460
that was a straight-up,
by-the-numbers bust which, never mind.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.629
Second of all, what ever happened
to this... this concept

32:02.629 --> 32:04.464
of you and I are supposed
to be a team here?

32:04.464 --> 32:07.842
Why in the hell would you take the word
of some... some scumbag, puss pimple

32:07.842 --> 32:09.928
like this Frankie Cantor over mine, huh?

32:10.219 --> 32:12.805
You haven't banked a lot of credibility
with me, Detective Sipowicz.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.475
This would be with regard to you
having to prosecute that thing

32:15.475 --> 32:16.726
with Giardella's cigarettes?

32:16.726 --> 32:19.646
- And having you as my sole witness.
- I don't drink anymore.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.439
Watching you stumble through testimony,

32:21.439 --> 32:25.151
not to mention grabbing your crotch,
and calling me a pissy little bitch.

32:25.318 --> 32:27.320
I apologize for my bad behavior.

32:28.655 --> 32:30.740
All's I'm askin',
before you kick this case,

32:30.740 --> 32:32.992
how about you interview
that dancer Monique?

32:33.242 --> 32:35.328
I am going to interview her, Detective.

32:35.912 --> 32:39.457
And if she tells me that you got
your rocks off, I'm dropping the charges.

32:39.582 --> 32:40.583
How about if she tells you

32:40.583 --> 32:42.669
Frankie Cantor's not only
pimping out his dancers,

32:42.919 --> 32:45.797
he's launderin' mob money,
which Monique,

32:45.797 --> 32:49.425
whose rights you're so concerned
I violated, is prepared to testify to?

32:49.425 --> 32:51.678
Don't you say anything
you shouldn't, Monique.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.555
- Up yours, Frankie.
- Careful, bitch!

32:54.806 --> 32:55.890
Shut up, Frankie!

32:58.851 --> 33:00.937
I'll catch up with you
one of these days, you'll see.

33:03.439 --> 33:06.526
If Monique says that, Counselor,
you gonna cut me a little slack?

33:07.110 --> 33:08.277
We'll see what she says.

33:28.631 --> 33:29.966
We got another problem, Luis.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.261
No way, man.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.515
Yeah. There's somethin' else
I gotta talk to you about.

33:39.392 --> 33:40.601
You said we were through.

33:40.893 --> 33:42.020
That's right, I did.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.355
But we got another cab robbery.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.734
Only this time, the driver got killed.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.408
They told me
that I'd be havin' a meal now.

33:55.533 --> 33:59.454
Forget it. Forget the meals, Luis.
Forget sleepin'. Forget it.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.540
You're here because you did this,

34:02.999 --> 34:06.210
and you're gonna be in here with me
until you admit it to me.

34:08.337 --> 34:09.338
We had a deal!

34:12.341 --> 34:13.342
Sit down.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.137
Sit down!

34:22.310 --> 34:24.270
Everything that I've said to you, forget.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.861
Look at me.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.112
Look at me, Luis.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.325
Because now we're gonna get serious, Luis.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.369
Now we're gonna talk about
what this is really about.

34:41.287 --> 34:44.082
You killed this guy,
and we're gonna be in here

34:44.207 --> 34:46.125
for as long as it takes
for you to tell me that.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.337
You know,

34:50.254 --> 34:53.257
you tell me it's over,
and then it's not over.

34:53.591 --> 34:57.011
And then you tell me it's over again,
and then it's not over.

34:58.429 --> 34:59.597
Well, you can forget it, man

34:59.597 --> 35:01.307
because you ain't
jerkin' me around anymore.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.894
In number five, you told me
that you used electrical tape.

35:05.561 --> 35:07.647
We found the same tape
in the dead driver's cab.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.524
Same MO, same area.

35:10.149 --> 35:13.194
I didn't kill anybody,
and you ain't stickin' me with no murder!

35:14.904 --> 35:18.658
When you called the cab dispatcher,
they got your voice on tape.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.536
So when we make a voice print,
we can match it to your other calls.

35:22.036 --> 35:25.331
Oh, so, uh,
every cab crime now, I did it, huh?

35:25.331 --> 35:27.416
- Hmm.
- Yeah, well, look, I ain't goin' for it.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.293
You know what I was wonderin', Luis?

35:30.503 --> 35:33.297
Did the driver have his own gun?
Was it self-defense?

35:33.923 --> 35:37.218
I didn't do it. Now, I'd like my meal now.

35:37.426 --> 35:41.681
Luis, there's an easy way,
and there's a hard way.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.099
What's it gonna be?

35:44.308 --> 35:48.437
I didn't kill anybody, and I don't know
anything about any shooting.

35:50.022 --> 35:51.023
Okay.

35:52.650 --> 35:53.734
Okay, Luis.

36:02.118 --> 36:05.204
- Sorry it took me so long.
- Oh, that's... that's okay.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.123
I wanted to make sure
the recorder worked.

36:07.957 --> 36:10.710
<i>Look, I hope you didn't get
the wrong impression</i>

36:10.710 --> 36:12.295
<i>from our conversation this morning.</i>

36:13.254 --> 36:14.881
<i>No, I didn't get
the wrong impression.</i>

36:14.881 --> 36:16.048
You said you didn't record us.

36:16.591 --> 36:17.592
I know.

36:17.717 --> 36:18.718
You're a liar!

36:19.677 --> 36:23.764
Jimmy, please. You'll make me cry.
Now, listen to me, you son of a bitch.

36:24.182 --> 36:27.602
I'm not going to bring you up on charges,
or report you to the Ethics Board.

36:27.894 --> 36:28.895
What are you going to do?

36:29.228 --> 36:30.813
I'm going to transfer out.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.525
I don't want to work with anyone like you.
And if I hear one word

36:34.525 --> 36:36.777
of the kind of rumors
that you threatened to circulate...

36:36.944 --> 36:38.946
No, forget it, forget it.
That's not going to happen.

36:39.071 --> 36:40.072
It better not.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.657
It better not, Jimmy.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.075
Laura, listen to me.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.244
It isn't gonna happen.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.374
Anything I could do
to get you to give me that?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.251
Once you can't trust someone,

36:52.251 --> 36:54.212
the world gets kind of complicated,
doesn't it?

36:55.004 --> 36:56.255
How do you know there aren't copies?

36:56.714 --> 36:57.715
Point.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.927
Yeah, point, asshole.
I'll have my desk cleared out by 5:00.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.472
I've gotta hand it to you, Laura.
You're a lot tougher than I thought.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.225
You can mention that
in the glowing transfer recommendation

37:07.225 --> 37:08.476
you're going to write.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.827
- Now or never, Medavoy.
- Hey, Andy, wait a minute.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.250
Hi. I'm Detective Sipowicz.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.919
Hi. I'm the new
detectives' administrative aide,

37:34.919 --> 37:36.212
Donna Abandando.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.630
Do I have to say that

37:37.755 --> 37:39.674
- three times real fast?
- Yeah, I know.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.051
Those two together,
they're quite a mouthful.

37:42.593 --> 37:46.222
Amen to that.
Uh, you mind if I stick with Donna?

37:46.597 --> 37:51.352
Not at all. Uh, anyway,
any typing or filing you want done,

37:51.519 --> 37:53.562
that's what I'm here for.
Well, that's the best news

37:53.562 --> 37:55.231
I've heard all day. Welcome.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.357
Thanks.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.694
Is, uh, is he okay?

37:59.944 --> 38:02.530
uh, 'm sorry. This is Detective Medavoy.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.615
Pleased to meet you.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.536
Detective Medavoy
has taken a vow of silence

38:08.661 --> 38:11.580
till they, uh, they sort out
this mess in Bosnia, huh.

38:12.164 --> 38:15.793
Well, it's been nice meeting you, Donna,
and, uh, don't worry about him.

38:16.043 --> 38:17.753
If he wants anything, he'll leave a note.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.729
I'm gonna ask you to leave us
alone for a minute, James, all right?

38:34.854 --> 38:35.896
Sure.

38:37.606 --> 38:39.817
Why don't you take this with you? Okay?

38:40.901 --> 38:41.902
Okay.

38:42.611 --> 38:44.196
Lock the door on the way out, will ya?

38:45.781 --> 38:47.158
What's this?

38:47.158 --> 38:49.493
Luis, you gotta
understand somethin'. The man you killed,

38:50.745 --> 38:51.787
I knew him.

38:51.912 --> 38:53.331
Hey, man, I didn't kill nobody!

38:55.833 --> 38:59.337
He worked 32 years pulling scumbags
like you out of burning buildings.

39:00.463 --> 39:01.797
Worked some side jobs.

39:05.009 --> 39:06.302
Make it easy on his family.

39:08.637 --> 39:09.764
His son's a cop.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.477
He works right here in the one-five.
Right in this building.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.147
And you took this man's life
for 12 dollars.

39:19.774 --> 39:23.319
- I can't let it go, Luis.
- I told you, man, I didn't kill nobody.

39:23.569 --> 39:26.030
No more talkin'. The talkin' is over.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.491
- You're gonna tell me the truth right now.
- Or what?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.455
What's the hardest
you've ever been hit, Luis?

39:35.790 --> 39:37.500
- Come on, man, get out of my face.
- Hmm.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.754
Because I promise you,
unless you tell me the truth,

39:41.879 --> 39:44.215
I am gonna give you the beating
of your life in this room.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.428
- You can't do that.
- I can do that.

39:49.720 --> 39:53.224
I can do anything I want in here. Okay?

39:53.391 --> 39:56.769
Nobody's gonna hear it.
It's my word against your word.

39:57.603 --> 40:00.689
I will beat you, Luis,
until you wish you were dead.

40:02.441 --> 40:05.069
So, you have ten seconds
to start tellin' me the truth.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.113
Nine, eight...

40:07.988 --> 40:09.824
What if he had a gun,
like you were askin' me before?

40:09.990 --> 40:12.118
So, he had a gun.
So, it was self-defense. Is that right?

40:12.243 --> 40:14.245
- Yeah, he had a gun.
- Six, five...

40:14.245 --> 40:16.997
- Wait a minute! I'm tellin' you!
- You're lyin' to me, Luis.

40:17.123 --> 40:21.168
You are still lyin'. I searched that cab,
every inch. There was no gun.

40:21.627 --> 40:24.797
- Four, three, come on.
- He was tryin'! Okay, all right!

40:24.922 --> 40:27.091
He was tryin' to grab my gun.
I thought he was gonna shoot me.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.467
Tell me exactly what happened.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.431
It was like the others, man, okay?
I showed him the gun.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.183
I told him to pull into the alley,
and to give me the money.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.311
But he wouldn't do it.
So, I pointed the gun at him,

40:39.520 --> 40:42.106
and I tried taping his wrists,
so I'd be able to take the money.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.358
But all of a sudden,
he tries to grab the gun.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.820
I mean, I was just tryin' to scare him.
But when he was grabbin' the gun,

40:47.820 --> 40:50.614
- there was nothin' else that I could do.
- So, you shot him.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.242
Yeah, but he didn't give me
no choice, man.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.912
Okay, Luis. Okay.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.249
Now, I'm gonna ask those people
to come back in here.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.669
And I'm warning you, I'd better not
have to send them out again.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.046
Do I get to do this on tape?

41:06.714 --> 41:09.633
Yeah. Yeah.
I'll have the camera brought in.

41:12.386 --> 41:15.514
What about at the end
when... when I say how... how I feel?

41:16.515 --> 41:17.558
We can do that too.

41:19.810 --> 41:23.522
You see, Luis? I told you we'd come
out of this okay, didn't I?

41:32.198 --> 41:33.741
Monique,
I need you to sign...

41:33.866 --> 41:34.867
- James.
- Yeah?

41:36.994 --> 41:38.162
- We're ready.
- Okay.

41:39.455 --> 41:41.707
It was like you said, Detective.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.876
And the stripper's testimony
will make our case.

41:44.877 --> 41:45.961
Good.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.508
So, I guess I owe you an apology.

41:51.342 --> 41:55.429
I don't know. I think I may still owe you
for that time outside the court.

41:57.139 --> 41:59.433
Maybe I could work
some more off at dinner?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.979
Let me see if I can decipher
that location.

42:03.979 --> 42:06.440
Oh, don't start that Latin crap
with me again, huh?

42:07.816 --> 42:09.818
Did you just invite me out to dinner?

42:11.028 --> 42:12.446
- Yeah.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.574
Why in the world would I want
to have dinner with you?

42:16.075 --> 42:17.618
I don't know. You do or you don't.

42:20.704 --> 42:22.540
Yeah, I do.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.500
- Good.
- Good.

42:25.084 --> 42:26.126
Good.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.675
Good.

42:33.801 --> 42:36.011
I was tryin' to tape his wrists.

42:36.011 --> 42:38.013
He kept tryin' to grab my gun,
so I shot him.

42:39.098 --> 42:40.683
Where did you shoot him, Mr. Hernandez?

42:41.016 --> 42:42.017
Where on his body?

42:43.936 --> 42:45.020
In the face, I think.

42:47.815 --> 42:48.983
And then what'd you do?

42:52.278 --> 42:55.281
I jumped out, I ran
to the subway and I went home.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.034
Where's the gun you used?

43:01.912 --> 43:03.372
It's at my girlfriend's house.

43:04.081 --> 43:05.374
Okay, Luis, that'll do it.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.127
- Okay, let's get a warrant for the gun.
- All right.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.878
What about the other thing? The remorse?

43:11.755 --> 43:13.132
Go ahead, tell him how sorry you are.

43:13.465 --> 43:16.635
- I just wanna say I'm really sorry that...
- Good work.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.360
- How's that Kiev?
- It's good.

43:34.486 --> 43:35.821
Yeah, they do a nice job here.

43:43.704 --> 43:45.122
Sorry. I sweat when I eat.

43:49.001 --> 43:50.294
You remind me of my father.

43:51.837 --> 43:53.088
Is that a plus or a minus?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.215
Plus.

43:56.508 --> 43:57.551
He's a...

43:58.677 --> 44:00.346
enthusiastic eater too.

44:03.182 --> 44:06.060
He has four brothers.
They come over every Sunday,

44:06.352 --> 44:09.563
and they eat a ton,
and they drink even more, and...

44:10.439 --> 44:13.817
They end up in fistfights with each other,
and they think it's fun.

44:14.443 --> 44:15.778
Oh, yeah, when I was drinkin'...

44:17.780 --> 44:19.448
it will change your idea about fun.

44:20.199 --> 44:23.410
Oh, don't get the wrong idea.
That's not all my dad.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.247
In fact, he's the kindest,
most decent man I've ever known.

44:27.623 --> 44:30.209
He took a second job
to pay my tuition at Saint John's.

44:30.542 --> 44:33.170
Said he wanted me to be able
to concentrate on my studies.

44:34.129 --> 44:37.883
And when I graduated...
Oh, he was so proud.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.762
He sat right in the front row,
with all my uncles.

44:42.513 --> 44:45.224
They were all wearing these
gigantic red carnations.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.645
And when I walked by,
they were all shouting, "There she is!"

44:51.814 --> 44:52.940
"There's our Slyvia."

44:55.109 --> 44:57.027
Sounds like a good man.

44:57.861 --> 45:00.739
And he sweats when he eats.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.617
Yep.

45:07.371 --> 45:09.123
I, uh...

45:11.166 --> 45:14.420
- I like fish.
- How come you ordered steak?

45:15.462 --> 45:18.716
No. I was tellin' you
somethin' about myself.

45:19.341 --> 45:21.301
I mean, you know, you told me
somethin' about you.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.637
I'm tellin' you about me. I like fish.

45:24.346 --> 45:25.389
I got an aquarium.

45:27.349 --> 45:30.477
- Really?
- Saltwater tropical.

45:36.942 --> 45:39.319
You know, you give 'em half a chance,
people can surprise you.

45:41.447 --> 45:44.575
So, uh, you wanna maybe do this again?

45:48.871 --> 45:51.123
Yeah, I would.

46:12.978 --> 46:14.104
You doin' the DD5s?

46:15.481 --> 46:16.482
I'm done.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.944
I appreciate you showin' me the ropes
with that interrogation.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.530
I feel like I'm learnin' from the best.

46:32.664 --> 46:33.707
What's on your mind, James?

46:34.708 --> 46:37.127
I wanted to ask you,
when you sent me outside,

46:37.336 --> 46:39.254
you gave me your gun
and so forth, uh...

46:40.339 --> 46:43.175
I wanted to ask you
what happened in there?

46:44.384 --> 46:45.385
Why the guy gave it up?

46:46.637 --> 46:50.766
- You mean, did I beat it out of him?
- Yeah. If that's why he confessed.

46:51.683 --> 46:53.602
- I didn't beat him.
- Then why'd he give it up?

46:54.019 --> 46:55.062
Because he's guilty,

46:55.687 --> 46:58.232
and he knew I was willing
to beat it out of him to get the truth.

47:00.067 --> 47:01.568
So, if it came to it,
you would've beaten him?

47:03.821 --> 47:05.072
Let me put it to you like this.

47:06.240 --> 47:07.991
I never raise my hand to a guy

47:07.991 --> 47:10.994
if I think he's guilty,
or I'm trying to find out if he's guilty.

47:11.245 --> 47:13.914
But if I'm sure he's guilty
and the case is gonna walk

47:13.914 --> 47:15.499
unless I raise my hand,

47:15.791 --> 47:18.210
- I do what I gotta do.
- Even though you're breakin' the law?

47:18.794 --> 47:21.338
Okay, you're askin' me
if I believe in the constitution, yes.

47:21.505 --> 47:24.967
I believe in the constitution,
and I hang on to that as long as I can.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.553
But in the case of a murderer
like this, who's gonna walk,

47:28.011 --> 47:31.223
I leave my gun and my jewelry outside,
along with the constitution.

47:31.723 --> 47:32.975
And if you're wrong about this guy?

47:33.100 --> 47:34.601
Well, then God forgive me.

47:39.064 --> 47:42.901
If you... if you want, I can make
somethin' up prettier than that, James.

47:43.610 --> 47:44.611
But that's the way it is.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.115
- Okay.
- Night.

47:48.490 --> 47:49.491
Night.
