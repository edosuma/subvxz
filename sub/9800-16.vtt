00:21.963 --> 00:24.545
Maurice! Mort!

00:26.057 --> 00:27.423
Something wrong, your majesty?

00:27.503 --> 00:31.016
Yes You did not tell me it was my birthday!

00:31.320 --> 00:32.689
It's not your birthday.

00:32.770 --> 00:39.333
Of course it is. Otherwise, why would have given me this gynormous present?

00:39.720 --> 00:42.488
Yeah, we didn't get you a present.

00:42.830 --> 00:43.590
I did.

00:43.870 --> 00:45.730
No you didn't. No, I did!

00:46.615 --> 00:47.430
I didn't.

00:47.510 --> 00:51.270
Oh, I see! So you forgot my birthday.

00:51.350 --> 00:53.470
No, it's not your birthday.

00:53.550 --> 00:55.666
And this isn't a birthday present.

00:59.997 --> 01:01.141
Protect me!

01:08.406 --> 01:09.336
Oh, hello.

01:14.713 --> 01:19.170
Whoa, no. Stop right there! Come no closer!

01:21.472 --> 01:24.741
Maurice, it is doing everything I am doing.

01:25.860 --> 01:30.790
I do not like it, Maurice. Look how it mocks me in silence,

01:30.870 --> 01:32.936
it's like a mini mime.

01:33.084 --> 01:34.730
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop it!

01:34.956 --> 01:36.465
This is a worst birthday ever.

01:37.968 --> 01:40.900
A hot cup of joe and a quiet morning. Nice.

01:44.650 --> 01:46.529
I beg you, please.

01:47.510 --> 01:48.502
Back up.

01:49.712 --> 01:50.440
What?

01:50.720 --> 01:54.415
That thing, it is a mocking machine.

01:55.970 --> 01:58.726
See that? It just wants to hurt me.

01:58.977 --> 02:01.115
Ah! Where did you get a robot?

02:01.602 --> 02:05.406
Oh, please, do not be pretending, because I know it was you

02:05.486 --> 02:08.090
who made this robot thing to mock me.

02:08.454 --> 02:09.019
Quit it!

02:09.098 --> 02:12.543
Well, ringtail, we are indeed working on a mocking you scenario.

02:13.260 --> 02:15.262
Operation "Mock Julian"

02:15.476 --> 02:16.760
But it's still in the lab.

02:16.979 --> 02:20.780
It's only at mach 2. I'd like to get to mach 8 before implementation.

02:20.940 --> 02:24.059
So if you did not make this copying cat, who did?

02:24.240 --> 02:25.350
Who, indeed?

02:25.530 --> 02:27.110
No, who indid.

02:28.420 --> 02:29.976
According to my research,

02:30.056 --> 02:34.600
this robot was designed to learn how to be a lemur before being sent on an outer space mission.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.020
Once the robot has mastered lemur behavior

02:37.230 --> 02:39.611
it will be sent to explore Mars.

02:39.691 --> 02:42.462
Isn't space exploring more of a chimp thing?

02:42.542 --> 02:47.158
It's a life-emulating robot. Aka the LEM-R.

02:47.320 --> 02:52.327
The humans believe that lemur locomotion is ideal for traversing the hummocky Martian landscape.

02:53.030 --> 02:55.438
Hummocky. Fascinating

02:55.620 --> 02:56.312
What?

02:56.392 --> 02:58.800
He's saying that the robot is here to learn from you.

02:59.020 --> 03:00.860
Learn, from me?

03:01.130 --> 03:05.950
Yes, he's going to copy your every move and then take that knowledge into space.

03:06.030 --> 03:07.721
Into space.

03:09.420 --> 03:11.160
I am a rolling model!

03:11.337 --> 03:14.450
I shall teach you everything about being a lemur king.

03:14.730 --> 03:17.070
The bossing, the boasting.

03:17.210 --> 03:20.010
But mostly of all - the boogying.

03:20.090 --> 03:21.430
This can't be right.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.818
I shall call you... Lemmy.

03:25.991 --> 03:29.270
Now you are royalty just like me.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.842
But still you have many things to do.

03:32.055 --> 03:33.400
As I was saying.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.590
You have many things to be learning.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.920
Things like the mambo,

03:39.144 --> 03:40.309
the moonwalk,

03:40.820 --> 03:42.134
the epyptian,

03:42.290 --> 03:43.850
the electric noodle.

03:44.046 --> 03:45.000
The robot.

03:46.191 --> 03:48.650
No, no, jerkier. You know, like a robot.

03:49.650 --> 03:51.470
I would think that one would be easy for you.

03:51.636 --> 03:53.160
I don't like robot.

03:53.340 --> 03:58.659
Listen, since that robot showed up, my life has been easy, real easy.

03:58.870 --> 04:01.313
So don't ruin this, Mort. D-don't.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.580
I still don't like robot.

04:03.860 --> 04:08.234
Yes, Lemmy. You're bringing it to the street and keeping it realistic.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.200
It's madness, utter madness!

04:11.459 --> 04:15.267
That robot will need to be decisive, focused, practical,

04:15.466 --> 04:18.810
and able to disarm a tentacled space squid from 50 yards.

04:18.994 --> 04:19.600
Right.

04:19.839 --> 04:22.751
You can't boogie your way out of a martian invasion,

04:22.831 --> 04:24.816
Those space squids play for keeps.

04:25.075 --> 04:26.577
But what can we do about it?

04:26.820 --> 04:30.790
Extract the robot from Julian's sick schooling and teach it the penguin way.

04:30.990 --> 04:34.200
Yes! Yes! We're getting a robot.

04:34.280 --> 04:37.469
- Affirmative. - But how are we gonna get the robot away from Julian?

04:38.220 --> 04:40.785
Leave that to me.

04:43.990 --> 04:44.640
Okay.

04:45.054 --> 04:46.091
Really?

04:46.358 --> 04:48.759
You want us to play hide and seek?

04:48.839 --> 04:51.130
Yes, it is good idea. You like?

04:51.210 --> 04:52.920
I do, Mort, I do.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.845
Lemmy can learn my seeking technique,

04:55.925 --> 04:59.116
ooh, also my counting technique

04:59.196 --> 05:02.220
I have added a few numbers of my own that you will be loving.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.269
One, tulien,

05:06.349 --> 05:08.190
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,

05:08.270 --> 05:10.270
me-leven.

05:11.765 --> 05:17.420
First off, I'd like to welcome our robotic ambassador to Mars.

05:18.748 --> 05:23.410
We're going to teach you some patended penguin moves that I think you'll find very useful.

05:23.490 --> 05:27.119
Especially when you come face-to-snout with a vicious space squid.

05:28.050 --> 05:28.720
Now watch. Lotus strike.

05:30.682 --> 05:32.184
Roundhouse squared.

05:32.851 --> 05:34.060
Combo punch.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.220
You are getting all this, friend?

05:39.664 --> 05:40.508
Where you going?

05:41.980 --> 05:44.309
Dancing? No, no.

05:44.590 --> 05:46.570
We're teaching you the techniques you can use here.

05:47.360 --> 05:50.296
Don't you understand? We know what's best for you.

05:50.519 --> 05:54.238
Robot, I refuse to let you leave this compound.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.920
Beautiful roundhouse

06:02.740 --> 06:04.560
Oh, Lemmy!

06:06.470 --> 06:09.389
Where is my little robo-rascal?

06:09.469 --> 06:13.110
Oh, Leeeeeeeeemmy...

06:16.610 --> 06:19.918
I have lost all sensation in my feet

06:19.998 --> 06:21.910
I think I have internal bleeding.

06:23.520 --> 06:26.637
You are thinking you can hide from me,

06:26.910 --> 06:28.680
but you can't.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.880
You found me. Yay!

06:33.930 --> 06:37.150
Of all the disappointments, this is a dissapoint-iest.

06:38.140 --> 06:41.610
Where is my bionical buddy? Who knew he was so good at hiding.

06:41.880 --> 06:45.570
Maybe he's so good, you'll never, ever see him again.

06:45.879 --> 06:48.080
Especially with the penguins.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.579
No, Mort, I will never stop seeking my Lemmy.

06:51.659 --> 06:55.680
I will seek and seek and seek.

06:56.464 --> 07:00.710
Okay. But the penguins don't have him, all right?

07:01.940 --> 07:04.640
Okay, that almost sounded suspicious to me.

07:05.760 --> 07:09.940
Do you know some things about where my robot is, Mort?

07:10.080 --> 07:11.940
Oh no, I know no things.

07:12.350 --> 07:15.789
Okay. Then you won't mind if I

07:15.964 --> 07:17.330
tickle you.

07:17.500 --> 07:17.800
Pile on, men.

07:18.184 --> 07:19.340
Spill your guts, Mort.

07:23.170 --> 07:30.410
Spill your tiny, tiny guts. Where is my Lemmy?

07:40.350 --> 07:45.393
Mort, the back of your knee, the back of your knee. Mort, are you ready to tell me?

07:45.473 --> 07:47.413
No, more tickling.

07:50.128 --> 07:52.510
I will spill my guts now.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.563
Kowalski, report.

07:56.887 --> 07:58.160
The robot...

08:01.500 --> 08:06.070
What has been done by you to my poor Lemmy?

08:07.680 --> 08:10.220
It... It was an accident.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.061
- We didn't mean to blow him up. - Kablamo!

08:13.470 --> 08:19.020
He was the only robot I ever was loving.

08:19.260 --> 08:24.572
- We are sorry, ringtail. It's just, we knew what was best for the robot. - Kablamo!

08:24.730 --> 08:26.940
- Ka-blowing his up was the best? - Kablamo!

08:28.577 --> 08:33.361
OK, I said we knew what was best, we just didn't do what was best.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.227
Kablamo.

08:36.610 --> 08:40.500
Your highness, this just isn't healthy. You got to shake this off.

08:40.580 --> 08:45.390
No, Maurice, I will not shake this or even my booty ever again.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.977
Foot-hugging time, yeah!

08:48.470 --> 08:51.670
Look at Mort hugging your feet. Doesn't that make you crazy?

08:52.000 --> 08:54.210
Don't you want to do something, anything?

08:54.516 --> 08:57.305
What is the point whithout my Lemmy?

08:58.060 --> 09:01.320
Skipper, something's not right. I feel terrible.

09:01.530 --> 09:03.320
Same here, young Private.

09:03.470 --> 09:09.600
It's as if there's a dark abyss at the center of your soul and all that is light and good in the world is slipping into it.

09:10.770 --> 09:14.460
This is what it feels like when you have done the wrong thing.

09:14.753 --> 09:17.930
We've never done the wrong thing before. I don't like it!

09:18.010 --> 09:21.320
Me neither. Men, we got to fix this.

09:24.813 --> 09:29.754
Well. Now that the cofee maker's working, let's get started on that robot.

09:32.281 --> 09:39.110
Oh, Lemmy. Of all the good times we had, the ones we didn't have were the best.

09:39.840 --> 09:45.580
Ringtail, you turn that frown upside down. Your robo-buddy is back.

09:47.044 --> 09:47.959
Lemmy?

09:50.676 --> 09:56.100
Is this really you and not some crazy dream that my head is making!

09:57.110 --> 09:58.591
It is you!

10:00.170 --> 10:02.091
Mort, off the royal feet.

10:05.340 --> 10:07.110
That is my Lemmy!

10:09.110 --> 10:15.039
Men, we just made a very spoiled, very obnoxious lemur very happy.

10:15.119 --> 10:16.361
And that's a good thing

10:17.845 --> 10:18.482
Innit?

10:19.680 --> 10:25.720
- And touchdown in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. - It's Lemmy's big moment.

10:26.080 --> 10:30.260
The robot has set down on the surface of Mars.

10:30.340 --> 10:35.040
And we'll soon know if that billion-dollar experiment pays off.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.593
It's taking its first steps.

10:39.219 --> 10:41.840
What is he doing, Bob? He's... dancing?

10:43.084 --> 10:45.129
I beleive that's the electric noodle.

10:46.210 --> 10:50.043
Look at him go. He is boogie-riffic.

10:52.690 --> 10:57.280
And that is why you never send a lemur to do a penguin's job.
