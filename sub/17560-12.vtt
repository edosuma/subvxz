So, how was the band
last night?

00:03.795 --> 00:05.004
It sucked, but check it out.

00:05.088 --> 00:07.090
I'm in the ladies' room
totally ragging about

00:07.173 --> 00:09.342
how bad the band was,
and the woman in the stall

00:09.426 --> 00:10.927
next to me
had no toilet paper.

00:11.010 --> 00:13.346
[laughs]

00:13.430 --> 00:15.306
That is a great story!

00:15.390 --> 00:16.933
No, no,
that's not the end of it.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.226
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.936
It's just that
sometimes you ramble, kid.

00:20.019 --> 00:21.938
I never really know
when it's over.

00:22.021 --> 00:24.941
Well, the toilet paper lady is
the head of Marquee Management

00:25.024 --> 00:27.402
only the biggest music
management firm in the city.

00:27.485 --> 00:29.070

00:30.530 --> 00:32.448
That is adorable, Holly.

00:32.531 --> 00:34.200
No, it's not over.

00:34.284 --> 00:35.952
She said that she liked
my taste in music

00:36.035 --> 00:38.455
and she offered me a job
as junior manager.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.457
I start today!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.628
- That's the end of the story.
- Oh.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.131
Yeah, it's a good thing
you're pretty.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.675
Lauren, this is the start
of my real career

00:50.759 --> 00:53.261
in the music business.
Do you know how lucky I am?

00:53.344 --> 00:56.931
Finally, all of my great ideas,
I can put them to use!

00:57.015 --> 00:58.475
So, are you sure
that you're going to be okay

00:58.558 --> 00:59.976
being alone with Val all day?

01:00.059 --> 01:02.771
Holly, go, okay?
She is fine.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.397
It's been a week since
she called off the wedding

01:04.480 --> 01:06.649
and you know what?
Yesterday, not one tear.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.569
In fact, she even laughed
a couple times.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.321
And not that phony laugh
like I did

01:11.404 --> 01:13.948
at your toilet paper story.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.200
But a real laugh.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.202
You know, if you ask me,
I think she's finally

01:17.285 --> 01:18.828
getting over the trauma
of the breakup.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.622
- Oh.
- 'Holly!'

01:20.705 --> 01:21.956
Yeah?

01:25.794 --> 01:28.087
Oh, yeah,

I'm not that junior.

was pick up her lunch

05:08.683 --> 05:10.643
and her dog's poo.

consider switching those bags.

Sometimes, people
aren't going to like you

05:28.327 --> 05:30.913
for no reason at all.

a peanut butter sandwich.

05:47.388 --> 05:51.059

you save her life

05:53.227 --> 05:55.146
and she'll owe you one.

You see, in the moment
no one realizes

05:58.608 --> 06:00.735

when I started cleaning.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.483
I realized
how dirty the windows were.

06:40.566 --> 06:41.859
Then after I cleaned the windows
I looked out here

if I take this dress off

07:14.892 --> 07:16.769

would I be happier?

you made the right decision.

See these clothes I'm in?

10:46.020 --> 10:49.565
Don't tell anyone,
but this is my wedding outfit.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.525
I wear it every day.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.572
Michelle,
to be honest with you..

10:58.824 --> 11:00.868
That is really sick.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.996
Oh, my God.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.915
You know,
you have got to move on.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.793
But you can't because you got
all Donna's crap in your house.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.796
Listen, I want you to go home
and pack up all her stuff

11:11.879 --> 11:13.547
in a box, and tomorrow,
I want you to take it to her

11:13.631 --> 11:14.882
and say, "Goodbye, Rick."

11:14.965 --> 11:16.842
- Rick?
- Donna.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.261
You know what?

11:19.345 --> 11:21.180
You're right. And you'll do
the same with Rick.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.599
- You're darn tootin'!
- Ha, ha.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.602
I love that we're doing this.
It's so alternative.

11:26.685 --> 11:30.064
I know. It feels so good after
the hard day I had at work.

11:30.147 --> 11:34.110
It's such a little dog,
but such big poops.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.778
Hey, don't look now,
but there's a woman

11:35.861 --> 11:37.113
totally checking you out.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.532
- Really?
- Watch her now.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.828
Well, look at you, Pippi.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.707
Leah! Hey, Leah.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.292
Tina, look, it's my boss.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.629
In a lesbian bar.
And I'm here, too.

11:53.712 --> 11:57.007
I had no idea that we were
playing on the same team.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.764
Huh. Looks like Pippi
just picked up her last poop.

12:13.023 --> 12:16.110
Okay, um, listen, Leah,
I just want you to know

12:16.193 --> 12:17.903
that this job
means everything to me.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.865
I know how hard it is to break
into the music business

12:20.948 --> 12:22.199
and I am so lucky, but--

12:22.283 --> 12:25.202
Oh-oh, before I forget,
uh, that client of yours..

12:25.286 --> 12:26.495
- Ben?
- Yeah, I was thinking.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.080
You know the right bars to go to

12:28.164 --> 12:29.707
maybe you know
the right music, too.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.668
I'd like to hear his CD.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.255
Well, we sisters
have to stick together.

12:38.007 --> 12:41.343
That's true. Oh, uh, Holly,
by the way, um..

12:41.427 --> 12:44.889
I'm not out at work.
I know, how pathetic is that?

12:44.972 --> 12:47.516
But I gotta tell you,
it's so good to finally have a..

12:47.600 --> 12:51.228
...member of the club
to talk to at work.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.860
I feel so guilty.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.988
Why? You never actually
said you were a lesbian.

13:01.071 --> 13:04.825
Let her think what she wants.
Now you're in the club.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.869
The lesbian club.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.122
[chuckles]
Seriously, that's hot.

13:10.206 --> 13:13.709
Now, not only am I a lesbian,
I'm a liar.

13:13.792 --> 13:17.296
I'm a lying lesbian.

13:17.379 --> 13:18.881
Also hot.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.761
Will you listen to me?
I quit college for this.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.763
I mean, this is a tough,
tough industry.

13:25.846 --> 13:28.807
'You don't get many breaks. I
can't afford to screw this up.'

13:28.891 --> 13:31.227
This is the beginning
of my entire career.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.770
And you're doing great.

13:32.853 --> 13:36.398
You've only been there a day,
and you're already the favorite.

13:36.482 --> 13:39.568
You know what? That's it.
I've gotta go tell the truth.

13:40.778 --> 13:43.405
All of my success
has been based on a lie.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.241
I mean, like, today,
I get to go to this really cool

13:45.324 --> 13:47.243
recording studio
to work with this band

13:47.326 --> 13:48.994
but it's this other
junior manager Dave

13:49.078 --> 13:51.413
that found them,
and he should get to go.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.208
But the poor bastard
is a hetero.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.547
[knock on door]

14:04.385 --> 14:06.178
Hey, Michelle,
what's going on?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.055
I just came to thank you
for last night.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.766
Uh-oh, how much
did I have to drink?

14:10.849 --> 14:13.936
No, no, thanks to you

14:14.019 --> 14:17.940
I just dropped off the box
of Donna's crap at her place.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.067
You were right.
It was amazing.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.570
I have total closure. It's like
this weight's been lifted.

14:22.653 --> 14:24.989
Oh, that is great, Michelle.
Yeah.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.991
So? What happened when you
dropped Rick's stuff off?

14:27.074 --> 14:29.285
I mean, did you
have that same feeling?

14:29.368 --> 14:31.036
Uh..

14:31.120 --> 14:32.705
Yeah.

14:32.788 --> 14:36.000
Closure rocks! Bye-bye!

14:36.083 --> 14:38.961
Then why are you hiding a box
of Rick's stuff behind the door?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.088
Oh, um..

14:41.171 --> 14:43.632
Uh, funny thing happened.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.175
I just talked to Rick,
and, uh

14:45.259 --> 14:47.803
he's been promising forever
to fix my leaky sink

14:47.886 --> 14:51.056
and he insisted on coming over
to do it right now, ha-ha.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.474
Isn't that so sweet?

14:52.558 --> 14:56.145
So I thought I'd just give him
the box when he gets here.

14:56.228 --> 14:59.857
Okay, so, um, uh, I'm gonna go
prepare for closure.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.735
It's really good
talking to you.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.487
Happy endings. Buh-bye.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.780
Val..

15:06.864 --> 15:08.157
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.492
- Val, who called who?
- Rick called me.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.662
- Val.
- Me called Rick.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.165
Here's a crazy question.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.000
Why didn't you
just call a plumber?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.668
Because he said
he would fix it

15:19.752 --> 15:21.962
and I want him
to commit to something.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.798
Bull. You were thinking
he'd come over

15:24.882 --> 15:26.175
and you two
would get back together.

15:26.258 --> 15:27.801
No, no, unh-unh. No.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.846
I got his box of crap
right here, ready to go.

15:30.929 --> 15:33.015
Wait, wait, whoa, what are you
doing? Don't fix that.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.975
Rick's gonna fix that,
Rick's gonna fix everything.

15:35.059 --> 15:38.562
Rick isn't gonna fix anything.
You are.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.690
[upbeat music]

15:49.782 --> 15:52.451
You know something, Leah? I-I
couldn't really hear the beat.

15:52.534 --> 15:57.039
I mean, this is the kind of song
where you want to be like this.

15:57.122 --> 16:00.668
But right now, I'm just
sort of more like this.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.836
Maybe if we, uh, bump up
the percussion a little bit?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.254
Good ear, Hol.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.012
Listen, um, Leah,
I just want to thank you

16:12.096 --> 16:14.556
for all of the opportunities
that you've given me lately.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.933
Hey, you've got talent.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.976
Oh, I'm really glad
to hear you say that

16:18.060 --> 16:19.728
because I really respect you.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.731
And...there's something that
I've been trying to tell you.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.316
And I know that
after I tell you this

16:24.400 --> 16:26.026
I may lose my job
which, by the way

16:26.110 --> 16:27.695
I so don't want to do
because I know

16:27.778 --> 16:30.406
that I'd be really good
at it, but..

16:30.489 --> 16:33.951
Leah...I'm not that gay.

16:35.202 --> 16:38.455
- That gay?
- Actually, I'm kinda straight.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.291
Actually, I'm totally straight.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.169
Hetero. Boy crazy.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.922
Me likey the fellas.

16:47.005 --> 16:49.591
You lied to me
about being gay? Why?

16:49.675 --> 16:51.427
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lie.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.761
It's just that you hated me

16:52.845 --> 16:54.304
and then you kinda started
liking me and--

16:54.388 --> 16:56.765
This-this is not the place
to discuss this.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.767
Okay, well, I just
wanted to apologize

16:58.851 --> 17:00.769
that it got so out of hand.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.522
But I'm still the same person
that you said had talent.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.525
Remember when I said,
"Bump up the percussion"

17:06.608 --> 17:08.109
and you said,
"Good ear, Hol?"

17:08.193 --> 17:11.821
Well, I still have the same ear,
just not a gay ear.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.075
- You lied to me.
- I know, and I'm sorry.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.286
But, you know..

17:17.368 --> 17:20.955
...it feels a lot better
to tell the truth and..

17:21.039 --> 17:23.459
Maybe you should try it.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.252
You're not a lesbian who hits,
are you?

17:26.336 --> 17:28.714
Oh, great, Lizzie McGuire's

17:28.797 --> 17:31.300
teaching me a lesson
about coming out.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.677
- What do you know about it?
- Come on.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.637
I mean, this is
the music business, Leah.

17:35.721 --> 17:37.765
Nobody cares that you're gay.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.809
Big deal.
Leah's a lesbian.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.564
Do you happen to have your ass
on the orange button

17:45.647 --> 17:48.567
that says "Intercom?"

17:50.152 --> 17:52.488
Free beer in the kitchen.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.744
Apparently, I do.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.585
(Michelle)
Okay, watch, here,
just grab this wrench

18:06.668 --> 18:09.463
and we're gonna tighten the bolt
right above the elbow joint.

18:09.546 --> 18:12.299
Ooh, whoa, whoa, slow down.
I've never done this before.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.551
(Michelle)
'No, no, no. I'll teach ya!'

18:15.886 --> 18:19.264
'Wow, nobody's been down here
for a while.'

18:20.724 --> 18:22.351
Well, you know what?
Why not?

18:22.434 --> 18:25.020
Men haven't really
worked out for you.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.689
What? No, no, we were just, uh

18:27.773 --> 18:29.691
doing some plumbing.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.361
So, how was your
recording session?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.780
The band was good,
the doughnuts were good

18:34.863 --> 18:38.158
and I outed my boss
with my ass.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.953
- What?
- I think I'm getting fired.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.496
- Why?
- I screwed up.

18:42.579 --> 18:46.083
Two days, and I'm fired
from the best job I ever had.

18:46.166 --> 18:49.503
'I can't believe
that I quit college for this.'

18:49.586 --> 18:52.923
Val, I made the right choice,
didn't I?

18:54.174 --> 18:57.386
Come here.
It's just a little setback.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.056
You made the right choice.
We both did.

19:01.139 --> 19:03.141
Glass of water, anyone?

19:03.225 --> 19:04.184
You fixed it!

19:04.268 --> 19:07.145
No. You fixed it.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.566
Well, you're like my own
fairy God-lesbian.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.779
Okay, I'm gonna go
cancel my plumber.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.739
[knock on door]

19:21.994 --> 19:25.372
- Oh. Leah.
- Pippi.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.665
Come on in.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.417
No, I don't like to see
where my employees live.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.377
Suddenly,
they become real people.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.802
Listen, Leah, I just..
I wanna apologize.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.054
Do you know how long I've worked
to keep my private life private?

19:41.138 --> 19:44.850
My whole life.
And you blew it in 30 seconds.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.936
- I know. I'm really sorry.
- Thank you.

19:49.855 --> 19:53.066
Nobody gives a crap
that I'm gay!

19:53.150 --> 19:57.613
Half of them said
that they already knew, which..

19:57.696 --> 20:01.617
Oh, well, I'm really glad that
this all worked out for you.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.993
And I don't want
to make it about me

20:03.076 --> 20:06.538
but am I still Holly Tyler,
junior manager?

20:06.622 --> 20:07.998
As long as you pick up
Tinky's poop

20:08.081 --> 20:11.293
you can call yourself
chairman of the board.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.921
Hey, Michelle,
um, this is my boss Leah.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.672
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:20.886 --> 20:24.848
Wow. Vince is right.
This is hot.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.146
Well..

20:31.230 --> 20:34.191
It looks like
Michelle is moving on.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.652
And so am I.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.278
You wanna come with me?

20:38.362 --> 20:41.406
I have to drop something off
at Rick's place.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.533
I'm so proud of you.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.537
You know what?
We have to wait a few minutes.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.498
There's a little bit
of a lesbian roadblock

20:49.581 --> 20:51.416
outside our door.
