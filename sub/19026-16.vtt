00:02.000 --> 00:04.992
<i>Before I settled on the outfit</i>
<i>for my first date with Kylie,</i>

00:05.080 --> 00:06.559
<i>I had to run it by the experts.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:09.916
So be honest but not too honest,
cos I'm feeling a little chunky.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.112
- We like it.
- Oh, thank God.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.270
I swore I heard the word jowly.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.514
So... how many outfits did you
try on before you picked that one?

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:38.600 --> 00:40.352
Not too many.

00:40.440 --> 00:43.000
On a first date,
I could see what a guy was wearing

00:43.080 --> 00:44.752
and know how far he would get.

00:44.840 --> 00:48.037
- Me too. That guy is getting boobies.
- Yeah, he is.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.075
That guy's getting a hug at the door.

00:53.120 --> 00:56.749
And that guy is getting a fake name
and a phone number with six digits.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.673
- I know this looks ridiculous.
- I don't think you do.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.797
The entire ensemble works.
The jacket never comes off.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.794
Carla, I need keys
to the Mini convertible.

01:05.880 --> 01:07.552
She can't get on my scooter.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.950
- The top won't go up.
- It'll be awesome.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.994
Sorry about your hair.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.629
Don't beat yourself up.
I got a scrunchie.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.559
There!

01:27.960 --> 01:29.188
What the hell was that?

01:31.840 --> 01:35.515
It's a poor little possum!
We should take him to the vet.

01:35.600 --> 01:39.354
<i>It was Sophie's Choice,</i>
<i>either leave the possum there to die</i>

01:39.440 --> 01:41.396
<i>or wrap it up in my sports coat</i>

01:41.480 --> 01:44.631
<i>and reveal the short-sleeved</i>
<i>nerd jersey lurking beneath.</i>

01:44.920 --> 01:47.673
Careful. His hoof is
bleeding on the gear shift.

01:47.760 --> 01:49.398
Sorry.

01:49.920 --> 01:53.708
This thing's dead. That'll be $120.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.553
<i>One hundred twenty dollars</i>
<i>for a stupid dead rat?</i>

01:57.560 --> 02:01.109
It's so sweet that you're depressed
about that poor little possum.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.477
I'll always remember him.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.949
Little Carlton.
I named him after my uncle.

02:09.039 --> 02:10.473
He had red eyes.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.792
Allergic to preserves, but he
spread them on everything, you know?

02:14.880 --> 02:18.236
We only lost a half hour.
We can still make that reservation.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.472
There's possums everywhere!

02:22.560 --> 02:24.312
No, no, no. It's just a box.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.396
A talking box.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.590
I think your shirt stopped the bleeding.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.079
Great!

02:35.960 --> 02:39.111
- Happy birthday, Laverne.
- Thanks, Carla.

02:39.200 --> 02:42.351
- Did your brother make you face cake?
- Sure did!

02:43.400 --> 02:45.755
- Wow!
- Can I have a piece of that face cake?

02:45.840 --> 02:48.035
I heard there was face cake.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.310
Back off!

02:51.400 --> 02:54.551
I'm saving this for my party tonight.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.518
Outstanding.

03:05.600 --> 03:10.037
Nurse, do me a favour, please.
Bandage this gentleman up?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.998
<i>They sensed my first date</i>
<i>wasn't going perfectly.</i>

03:13.080 --> 03:17.039
<i>Though I could smell face cake</i>
<i>in the air, it was about to get worse.</i>

03:17.120 --> 03:20.829
- Dr Dorkian, I presume?
- <i>The ex-girlfriend from hell.</i>

03:20.920 --> 03:25.789
<i>Get out! Get out before she sprays her</i>
<i>toxic stink over your new relationship.</i>

03:25.880 --> 03:30.431
Danni, love to stay and talk, but I'm
giving Kylie here a tour of the ICU.

03:30.520 --> 03:33.114
You were going to take me
back to the underpass!

03:33.200 --> 03:36.272
After the tour!
What is it with you and the underpass?

03:36.560 --> 03:39.233
She's your nightmare sister.
You take her to dinner.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.709
I spent the day with her.
She stole a sweater.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.792
So what? You're the one wearing it.
Now, let's go eat.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.758
I've had nothing all day
except vodka and olives.

03:49.480 --> 03:51.311
Thanks for the shirt, Lonnie.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.834
Are you doing this
because I forgot to shave?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.876
<i>Lord! That's a one-day moustache?</i>

03:55.960 --> 03:57.632
No, Lonnie.

03:59.360 --> 04:03.512
It's so great, because the residents
are practically our slaves.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.195
<i>I just said slaves</i>
<i>to my new black girlfriend!</i>

04:08.240 --> 04:10.708
Unfreeze, J.D., it's over.

04:11.280 --> 04:14.238
So... what's wrong with this guy?

04:14.320 --> 04:15.878
Well, let's see.

04:15.960 --> 04:18.757
"Fatigue, fever, malaise".

04:18.839 --> 04:22.515
- Have you been to Hong Kong, sir?
- Yeah.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.716
<i>And then I said something stupid.</i>

04:24.800 --> 04:25.915
Could be SARS.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.434
<i>I forgot that if any</i>
<i>doctor suspects SARS,</i>

04:28.520 --> 04:31.876
<i>it's cause for immediate</i>
<i>quarantine lockdown.</i>

04:48.640 --> 04:50.198
What have you done, Newbie?

04:51.880 --> 04:53.711
Quarantinis, anyone?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.993
Mr Donaldson hasn't
been to Hong Kong in 20 years,

05:12.080 --> 05:15.117
so I bet my one remaining testicle
no one has SARS.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.636
Unfortunately, by hospital policy,
we have to stay locked down

05:18.720 --> 05:21.837
until the labs come back,
and that will take several hours.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.912
Hang in there,
don't forget this is Dr Dorian's fault.

05:26.680 --> 05:30.195
Kylie, angry mob. Angry mob, Kylie.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.633
Hey.

05:31.720 --> 05:33.233
SARS sucks.

05:33.320 --> 05:37.313
OK. You can direct any technical
questions to my former sister-in-law.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.515
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.273
Otherwise, bear in mind
that we are short-handed.

05:41.360 --> 05:44.796
- There are only four doctors here.
- I counted more than that.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.474
I'm talking legitimate doctors,
turtle head.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.028
Pee Pants is a pathologist,
he doesn't count.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.759
Johnson is a dermatologist,
Greek for "fake doctor",

05:52.840 --> 05:55.957
and please don't even
get me started on you four surgeons.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.712
There's only two of us.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.473
You are so very useless,
I counted you both twice.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.073
Yeah, you did.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.710
Be honest. Is this the worst
first date you've ever been on?

06:07.800 --> 06:11.475
I don't know.
I think it's kind of exciting,

06:11.560 --> 06:14.313
being in a hospital,
getting to see you in action.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.868
- I wish I could be your assistant.
- Say no more.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.235
- Lonnie, shirt.
- No!

06:19.320 --> 06:21.470
Don't make me say pants. I'll do it.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.033
Still tanning, I see.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.880
- He's your bitch, isn't he?
- Yeah.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.270
That is so cute! I'll go change.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.755
- It looks like she's having fun.
- It's a front. She's miserable.

06:37.840 --> 06:41.150
The highlight was putting a possum
to sleep. That's not a euphemism.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.949
J.D., seeing a young doctor do his job
is an amazing turn-on for a girl.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.029
My dad's a doctor.

06:46.120 --> 06:50.318
I remember how excited I was the first
time I saw him work at the hospital.

06:50.400 --> 06:54.359
I didn't want to sleep with him, but
there were some complicated feelings.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.512
But that's totally normal
for an 11 -year-old, right?

06:57.600 --> 07:00.273
Anyway, yeah...

07:00.360 --> 07:01.759
I forgot...

07:02.200 --> 07:06.318
- So, what first, doctor?
- Well, you need a chart.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.628
Lonnie, chart!

07:09.440 --> 07:11.556
You look ridiculous.

07:11.640 --> 07:15.030
<i>Except for that glorious moustache.</i>

07:16.880 --> 07:18.836
Hey, grouchy pants, want to hang out?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.673
Does "hang out" mean choke you?

07:22.920 --> 07:25.593
Hey, Danni, what's shaking?

07:27.120 --> 07:29.395
Turk and Carla's wedding, we made out.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.074
- So did we.
- Was it at the same time?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.674
I have a habit of doing that
at people's weddings.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.591
Leaving. Good show, fellows.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.231
Wait for me, Per-Per!

07:42.800 --> 07:45.872
Smooth manoeuvre, Hoover.
You scared her off.

07:45.960 --> 07:49.635
You were the one
who was embarrassingly forward!

07:51.520 --> 07:54.671
I'm bored. I'm a surgeon,
and there's no surgery.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.830
Why do you think I brought you in here?

07:56.920 --> 07:59.559
We're short.
He needs his bedsores redressed.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.079
That's nurse stuff.
I don't have the expertise.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.197
- Turk, any idiot can be a nurse.
- I know. I just think...

08:07.040 --> 08:10.157
I knew you thought that. I knew it!

08:10.240 --> 08:11.992
You tricked me.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.794
- Say she's mine, Murphy!
- Not till you kill me!

08:19.880 --> 08:22.440
Only thing I detest more
than treating patients

08:22.520 --> 08:25.557
is treating them on an empty stomach.
I'm famished.

08:25.640 --> 08:28.712
- We've been here for eight minutes.
- I haven't eaten today.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.712
I was starving myself.
I was going to a steakhouse tonight.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.395
It was gonna be me, a 24-ounce
porterhouse, and lots of blood thinners.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.870
That's an incredibly boring story
with a fantastic...

08:39.960 --> 08:41.756
...finish!

08:44.400 --> 08:47.597
Five bucks says you can't do that twice.

08:47.680 --> 08:48.908
You're on.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.590
Double or nothing.

08:54.520 --> 08:57.080
So how's it going with Kylie?

08:57.480 --> 08:59.471
<i>There was nothing exciting going on.</i>

08:59.560 --> 09:03.633
This sucks. I need to look like a stud.
I can't unless I save somebody's life.

09:03.720 --> 09:06.678
- I need someone to have a heart attack.
- Got 20 bucks?

09:08.720 --> 09:12.235
So, Nurse Ghandirilla,
I need you to suction this guy,

09:12.320 --> 09:15.790
do a wet-to-dry dressing change,
and go ahead and top him off

09:15.880 --> 09:20.476
with a special sponge bath, happy
ending optional. His choice, not yours.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.313
- The guy's in a coma.
- Not all of him.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.393
- Not here. Not here. Not here.
- Danni!

09:28.200 --> 09:30.953
- Hi!
- Oh, good! You're here.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.237
Since we're amigos now,
could you do me a solid?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.357
This bald, sad clown
isn't really much of a nurse,

09:37.440 --> 09:40.273
so could you go ahead
and keep an eye on him for me?

09:40.360 --> 09:41.793
Yeah, sure. I'd love to.

09:44.200 --> 09:48.273
- Hey, didn't I go to your wedding?
- Yeah. You threw up on my gram-gram.

09:48.360 --> 09:51.636
Hey! You can't get inside my head.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.435
Hey, mentally strong!

09:57.800 --> 09:59.916
You can't smoke in here.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.073
I don't see any signs.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.994
So how much does he owe me, Barbarino?

10:09.680 --> 10:12.035
Six hundred, so far.

10:12.120 --> 10:15.874
Damn it, man.
You cannot afford this. Stop.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.313
Stop.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.719
Stop.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.670
Come on, Steve. Stay with me, buddy!

10:22.760 --> 10:25.228
You're not getting this one yet, Lord!

10:25.320 --> 10:28.437
- Could you make your face a bit redder?
- I want more money.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.238
- What?
- Fifty bucks, or I tell her.

10:30.320 --> 10:31.548
- I don't have it!
- Get it!

10:31.640 --> 10:33.995
Elliot,
I need another doctor here, stat!

10:35.840 --> 10:38.149
- Give me $30.
- I gave you 20. I'm tapped!

10:38.240 --> 10:39.559
Ask Johnson. He's loaded.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.995
I need a dermatologist over here, stat!

10:42.080 --> 10:45.311
Oh, yeah! Time to shine.

10:46.120 --> 10:48.395
What do you need? Is it a rash?

10:48.480 --> 10:52.109
I paid him to fake a heart attack.
He wants 50 bucks. We only have 20.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.839
You know, I feel like you guys
just use me for my money.

10:54.920 --> 10:58.037
You have a trust fund!
Now give me the money!

11:00.360 --> 11:03.318
- Clear!
- I'm alive!

11:03.720 --> 11:06.473
J.D., one. Lord, zero.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.956
<i>Just like that, love was in the air.</i>

11:09.040 --> 11:12.510
<i>It was as if our first date got others</i>
<i>talking about some of theirs.</i>

11:12.600 --> 11:14.716
I had a first date
where we played paintball.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.360
All he did the whole time
was shoot me in the face.

11:17.440 --> 11:21.149
After two years with that guy,
I'm like, "That's enough!" You know?

11:21.240 --> 11:25.028
First dates, huh?
Somebody give me 700 bucks.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.793
I went out with a girl.
She was the worst first date.

11:27.880 --> 11:31.839
I take her for a romantic ferry ride,
and I decide to take it out...

11:31.920 --> 11:33.990
OK. Your turn is done.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.153
The worst one I had was with a guy who
took me to a dumpy pizza parlour, right?

11:38.240 --> 11:42.791
You know what? Really don't
want to hear about this one. OK!

11:42.880 --> 11:46.953
She didn't like the pizza I ordered
because it had anchovies. Believe that?

11:47.040 --> 11:50.999
- It had anchovies.
- And pineapples.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.548
And pineapples?

11:53.640 --> 11:56.313
- And red peppers.
- And green peppers.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.597
- Wait... Red peppers.
- No!

12:01.640 --> 12:05.394
<i>I heard the pain in my best friend's</i>
<i>voice, and felt how little I cared.</i>

12:05.480 --> 12:09.189
<i>By the way Kylie was looking at me,</i>
<i>I knew she thought I was sexy.</i>

12:09.280 --> 12:10.679
You know something?

12:10.760 --> 12:14.196
Seeing you in your element today,
you seem so...

12:14.280 --> 12:16.430
<i>Here it comes... sexy.</i>

12:16.520 --> 12:17.635
Genuine.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.712
<i>She would have said sexy</i>
<i>if I had a moustache.</i>

12:20.800 --> 12:24.475
You know, James lied all the time,
and I don't know...

12:24.560 --> 12:28.030
It's just nice to be
with a guy I can trust.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.519
Cool.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.160
<i>Oh, no.</i>

12:38.440 --> 12:40.556
I don't deserve this.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.315
I'm no better than her ex-boyfriend.
I paid a hobo to fake a heart attack.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.678
So you just tell her the truth, she's
mad for a while, then forgives you.

12:49.760 --> 12:53.548
I see what you're saying.
There's no downside. Kylie...

12:54.800 --> 12:56.552
...you dated the devil.
- Turk.

12:56.640 --> 12:58.312
- And you lied to me.
- No!

12:58.400 --> 13:01.437
You never asked if I dated Dr Cox.
You can ask me anything.

13:01.520 --> 13:05.672
- I would never lie to you.
- Do you sometimes wish I had hair?

13:05.760 --> 13:08.194
- Yes.
- This is a nightmare.

13:08.280 --> 13:11.909
- I'm standing in a nightmare.
- Maybe I'm guilty of a lie of omission.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.151
- Cos you're a lie omitter!
- This may be asking too much,

13:15.240 --> 13:18.755
but could you keep it together
until we get home and talk about it?

13:18.840 --> 13:21.229
- Fine.
- Thank you.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.311
Carla, I like your hair that way.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.312
Laverne...

13:30.400 --> 13:33.631
...I bet you're tempted
to break open that face cake

13:33.720 --> 13:35.392
and just tear it apart.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.152
No one's touching this.

13:37.240 --> 13:40.676
Oh, I don't care. I'm not even hungry.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.752
Dr Kelso, I don't have $ 700.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.311
That sounded like the word "cake".

13:48.400 --> 13:53.599
You get me that damn face cake,
and you are free and clear.

13:57.960 --> 14:01.350
- Hi, Glenn.
- Hey.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.829
- I'm Glenn.
- I'm Glenn!

14:03.920 --> 14:07.913
Look, let's not go down
that road again. Come on.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.479
Shake.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.515
<i>OK, it's time to come clean.</i>

14:19.600 --> 14:22.160
I brought you here
because I want to tell you...

14:22.240 --> 14:24.834
Say I'm Glenn!

14:24.920 --> 14:26.592
That's peculiar.

14:26.680 --> 14:30.229
- What I really wanted to say was...
- J.D., J. D! Look at me!

14:33.680 --> 14:36.752
That's the kind of girl
my ex-boyfriend would have dated.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.193
I barely know her.

14:38.280 --> 14:39.554
<i>The lies begin again.</i>

14:39.640 --> 14:41.039
I would never sleep with her.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.634
<i>That's it.</i>
<i>You're stronger than this. No lies!</i>

14:43.720 --> 14:45.790
I race motorcycles.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.591
Excuse me.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.155
- What are you doing?
- I need more cash.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.595
- For what?
- I'm putting DSL in my box.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.671
Fine! But know this:

14:55.760 --> 14:59.878
You've been nothing but a disappointment
to me since the moment I ran over you.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.549
- Hey, baby.
- Keep it together.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.552
Do you remember
that quarantine we had seven years ago?

15:08.640 --> 15:13.031
It was just you and me, all alone,
late at night, here in the ICU?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.597
- That's it!
- Turk!

15:17.920 --> 15:19.069
You had to do that?

15:19.160 --> 15:22.038
Come on. If he wasn't jealous,
it wouldn't be a big deal.

15:22.120 --> 15:25.351
Give him a break! What if Jordan
had a history with somebody?

15:25.440 --> 15:28.671
Oh, fair enough. Hey, everyone,

15:28.760 --> 15:32.514
in the brief 18 months
that Jordan and I weren't together,

15:32.600 --> 15:34.670
how many of you had your way with her?

15:36.080 --> 15:40.278
Bear in mind, I need absolute
honesty here or I will brain you.

15:42.360 --> 15:47.798
Anyway, whoever taught Jordan
that reverse cowgirl position...

15:47.880 --> 15:51.475
...it was long overdue, but thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.596
You're a freak.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.070
Who ate my face fake?

16:02.680 --> 16:04.079
He did.

16:05.720 --> 16:07.836
$ 700.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.750
Wow, he is really out.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.400
A mild sedative fell into his juice box.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.199
J.D., I know why
you're lying about everything.

16:18.280 --> 16:21.556
You don't think you're good enough.
You've always been insecure,

16:21.640 --> 16:25.269
even though you're this funny,
weird, amazing guy.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.113
I mean, that's why
I fell in love with you,

16:28.200 --> 16:31.670
and I'm betting if you just act
like yourself, Kylie will too.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.035
Thanks, Elliot. Really.

16:34.120 --> 16:38.079
But that's a load of crap. Nobody
is themselves when they start dating.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.515
Dating is acting
like somebody you're not

16:40.600 --> 16:43.478
until they like you enough
to show them who you are.

16:43.560 --> 16:45.551
- No, it's not.
- What do you call that bra

16:45.640 --> 16:49.030
- you wore for your date?
- The miracle lift super push-up bra.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.872
Not everyone's as insecure as me.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.791
Carla, when you first dated Turk,

16:52.880 --> 16:56.668
- did you say you loved basketball?
- Yeah.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.116
- How many have you watched?
- One.

17:00.200 --> 17:03.954
But only because he made me choose
between basketball or having sex.

17:05.640 --> 17:09.997
Exactly. When I get out of here,
I'll treat her better than anyone has.

17:10.079 --> 17:12.275
I just gotta make it through tonight.

17:12.359 --> 17:16.433
Keep an eye on the bum's vitals. I gave
him enough sedative to put down a rhino.

17:20.119 --> 17:23.556
I don't understand why Carla
didn't tell me about you guys.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.468
Maybe because
she's really in love with me,

17:27.560 --> 17:31.712
and we injected you with diabetes to
very slowly get you out of the picture.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.952
Or maybe it's
because I really liked her,

17:36.040 --> 17:39.749
but she didn't feel the same way
about me, and I got the forehead kiss

17:39.840 --> 17:42.479
after spending 90 dollars
on theatre tickets.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.757
Or maybe,
and this is a huge outside maybe,

17:45.840 --> 17:48.912
maybe she knows you're
the kind of person who freaks out

17:49.000 --> 17:51.560
over irrelevant things from the past.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.791
Personally, I hope it's all three.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.638
<i>They say all horrible things</i>
<i>eventually come to an end.</i>

18:03.520 --> 18:06.671
The lab results are back,
and there is no SARS.

18:06.760 --> 18:10.230
The quarantine is over.
So, bye-bye, everyone.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.351
That looks like my neck!

18:24.480 --> 18:28.837
Oh, this does not end well for you.
Thanks for the heads-up, jumpsuit.

18:29.680 --> 18:33.559
You are going to pay
every cent of that $ 700.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.668
Double or nothing!

18:52.760 --> 18:55.035
We're even. Good night, sir.

18:56.920 --> 19:00.071
<i>Dr. Kelso made me realize</i>
<i>that lies come back to haunt you,</i>

19:00.160 --> 19:02.913
<i>even little ones about cake.</i>

19:03.000 --> 19:05.878
<i>Even a lie of omission</i>
<i>shook the foundation of a couple</i>

19:05.960 --> 19:08.713
<i>that was much more established</i>
<i>than Kylie and me.</i>

19:09.840 --> 19:11.910
<i>I knew I couldn't</i>
<i>let her go out that door.</i>

19:12.000 --> 19:14.878
- Let's go.
- Kylie, wait.

19:14.960 --> 19:18.714
I paid Steve 50 bucks
and an IOU for another 120

19:18.800 --> 19:21.109
to fake a heart attack.

19:21.200 --> 19:24.636
- I really wanted tonight to go well.
- Is there anything else?

19:25.680 --> 19:28.194
Adios, assface.

19:28.280 --> 19:31.113
I had sex with her a lot.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.953
- Why are you telling me this?
- If I don't come clean,

19:35.040 --> 19:37.793
whether it's a few weeks
or months or years from now,

19:37.880 --> 19:41.111
I know it will come back to haunt me,
ruin us, I don't want that.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.638
I'm not looking for a project.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.875
Yeah. I understand.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.795
So get it together.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.110
Now let's go get some coffee.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.950
Wait. You know, if we leave like that,
that's how you'll remember tonight.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.715
- I don't want that.
- So, what do you want to do?
