11:55.517 --> 11:57.275
Dangerous people.

11:57.379 --> 11:59.000
So we are leaving town.

11:59.103 --> 12:02.034
Kai, I really don't want to be
the person to...

12:02.137 --> 12:05.448
to bring this up to you,
but do you find Lily's timing

12:05.551 --> 12:07.793
-a little bit strange?
-You always do that

12:07.896 --> 12:11.137
with your face
when you want to say more.

12:12.448 --> 12:13.448
-What?
-[sighs]

12:13.551 --> 12:15.379
-Her-her shoes.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.103
Her shoes are-- they're clean.
They're brand-new.

12:17.206 --> 12:19.103
That's odd for a woman
who says she's on the run.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.103
-Maybe she wore out
the old pair.
-Maybe.

12:21.206 --> 12:22.448
Maybe the people
that are trying to find you

12:22.551 --> 12:23.724
are using her to draw you out.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.068

before you leave

built here.

than my store.

she's playing you.

a Pinkerton agent.

I'm so sorry.

I wanted to tell you.
-It doesn't matter.

coming to town, Gus.

itching to get back here

in there,

Second, I need you sober.

I'm a much better shot with
a few sips of liquid courage.

for you.

-I got the money.
-Good.

14:03.482 --> 14:07.103
But we are going to need
more than a week's wages.

14:07.206 --> 14:10.137
What about the money you stole
from the Tong?

14:10.241 --> 14:12.034
You must still have some.

14:12.137 --> 14:13.793
We are going to need every penny

14:13.896 --> 14:15.620

ahead of them.

14:15.724 --> 14:18.586

14:18.689 --> 14:21.482
I gave him everything
to keep quiet.

14:21.586 --> 14:23.241
Damn it, Sung Kai.

14:23.344 --> 14:26.379
Couldn't you see he was going
to tell them anyway?

14:34.206 --> 14:38.896
How long have you been
working for the Tong?

14:56.551 --> 14:58.275
I was so happy you were alive,
just to see you.

14:58.379 --> 15:00.172
I didn't want to think
you could betray me.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.241

I'm no threat to you.

15:19.379 --> 15:25.068

starting over...

15:28.275 --> 15:32.655
I knew if we ran,
they were going to find us.

15:32.758 --> 15:34.103
You stole money from the Tong.

15:34.206 --> 15:36.689
You killed their men, Sung Kai.

15:36.793 --> 15:40.172
Besides, my life was there.
I was good at my job.

15:41.862 --> 15:46.000
I did what was necessary,
and now they trust me.

15:46.103 --> 15:48.000
They'll realize their mistake
soon enough.

15:54.827 --> 15:58.310
If I didn't still love you,
you would already be dead.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.482
You saved my life once.
I tried to save yours.

16:05.724 --> 16:07.689
I only wish you ran.

16:07.793 --> 16:10.517
Or just kept the money.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Now your death is the only way
to clear our debt.

ten times the money I took.
