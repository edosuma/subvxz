My gracious.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.504
I'm so sorry you had to deal
with Cousin Chicle's schemes.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.573
My family's
out of control.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.042
It's fine. My cool daughter
took care of it.

10:44.044 --> 10:48.246
And guess what I got
from a vendor.

10:48.248 --> 10:49.781
It looks too big to me.

10:49.783 --> 10:53.585
But they said that's the style
now with punk rockers.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.787
Thanks for standing up for me
tonight.

10:55.789 --> 10:58.857
I'm bad,
but I'm no<i> so</i> bad, right?

10:59.092 --> 11:01.393
So when are you gonna
e kids?

11:01.395 --> 11:02.961
Dad!
