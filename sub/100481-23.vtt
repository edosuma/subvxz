WEBVTT

00:24.900 --> 00:26.000
>> John: HI THERE!

00:26.066 --> 00:27.066
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:27.133 --> 00:28.934
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
THINK OF IT LIKE THE MOON,

00:30.066 --> 00:32.133
IN THAT IT'S FRIGID, COLORLESS,

00:32.200 --> 00:32.767
AND OCCASIONALLY OCCUPIED BY ONE

00:32.834 --> 00:33.967
VERY LONELY, MALNOURISHED MAN

00:34.033 --> 00:34.967
WHO HAS DEFINITELY URINATED

00:35.033 --> 00:36.500
IN HIS SUIT.

00:36.567 --> 00:37.800
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO DIVE

00:37.867 --> 00:39.266
STRAIGHT IN WITH OUR MAIN STORY

00:39.333 --> 00:40.934
THIS WEEK, WHICH -- UNUSUALLY

00:41.000 --> 00:41.500
FOR US -- CONCERNS THE WEEK

00:41.567 --> 00:42.567
THAT WE'VE JUST HAD.

00:42.633 --> 00:43.800
IT'S ONE OF THE RARE TIMES WE'RE

00:43.867 --> 00:45.367
ACTUALLY LIVING UP TO OUR SHOW'S

00:45.433 --> 00:47.000
TITLE, UNLIKE WHAT IT PROBABLY

00:47.066 --> 00:47.934
SHOULD BE CALLED, "28 MINUTES

00:48.000 --> 00:49.266
ON THE CORN TAX OR WHATEVER

00:49.333 --> 00:52.066
THE FUCK WITH JOHN OLIVER."

00:52.133 --> 00:55.433
AND THE REASON WE ARE DOING THAT

00:55.500 --> 00:56.300
IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN ONE

00:56.367 --> 00:57.033
HELL OF A WEEK.

00:57.100 --> 00:58.200
SO TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

00:58.266 --> 00:59.266
ABOUT TWO THINGS: THE REPUBLICAN

00:59.333 --> 01:01.200
NATIONAL CONVENTION, AND THE

01:01.266 --> 01:02.133
HORRIFIC EVENTS IN KENOSHA,

01:02.200 --> 01:03.834
WISCONSIN, WHERE JACOB BLAKE WAS

01:03.900 --> 01:04.967
SHOT IN THE BACK BY POLICE, AND

01:05.033 --> 01:06.367
A VIGILANTE KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.033
AND WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT

01:08.100 --> 01:09.900
KENOSHA IN A BIT, BUT LET'S

01:09.967 --> 01:12.000
START WITH THE RNC, AN EVENT TO

01:12.066 --> 01:13.400
CELEBRATE THE STEWARDSHIP OF

01:13.500 --> 01:14.934
DONALD TRUMP -- A TOUGH SELL AT

01:15.033 --> 01:16.834
THE BEST OF TIMES, BUT SOMETHING

01:16.900 --> 01:18.300
THAT FELT PARTICULARLY OUT OF

01:18.367 --> 01:19.900
STEP CONSIDERING WE HAVE A

01:19.967 --> 01:21.633
PANDEMIC ON THE RAMPAGE, AN

01:21.700 --> 01:22.867
ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE UNFOLDING,

01:22.934 --> 01:24.000
AND WILDFIRES AND HURRICANES

01:24.066 --> 01:25.467
BATTERING THE COUNTRY.

01:25.533 --> 01:26.834
ALL OF WHICH MADE IT A LITTLE

01:26.900 --> 01:29.200
JARRING THAT THE REPUBLICANS'

01:29.266 --> 01:30.200
OPENING ARGUMENT SEEMED TO BE

01:30.266 --> 01:31.100
ESSENTIALLY THIS:

01:31.166 --> 01:33.033
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

01:33.100 --> 01:35.033
LEADERS AND FIGHTERS FOR FREEDOM

01:35.100 --> 01:36.633
AND LIBERTY AND THE AMERICAN

01:36.700 --> 01:37.066
DREAM!

01:37.133 --> 01:37.834
THE BEST!

01:37.900 --> 01:39.200
IS YET!

01:39.266 --> 01:41.600
TO COME!

01:41.667 --> 01:43.433
>> John: OKAY, THEN!

01:43.500 --> 01:44.900
THAT'S KIMBERLY GUILFOYLE,

01:44.967 --> 01:46.100
BRINGING AN ENERGY TO THE RNC

01:46.166 --> 01:47.700
THAT CAN REALLY ONLY BE

01:47.767 --> 01:48.867
DESCRIBED AS "SORRY, I THOUGHT

01:48.934 --> 01:49.667
DOVES WERE GOING TO SHOOT OUT

01:49.734 --> 01:51.066
OF MY HANDS."

01:51.133 --> 01:53.533
AND THAT VERY MUCH SET THE TONE.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.266
THE MAIN THEME OF THE CONVENTION

01:55.333 --> 01:56.667
SEEMED TO BE "TELLING LIES

01:56.734 --> 01:57.967
IN FRONT OF FLAGS."

01:58.033 --> 01:59.500
BECAUSE IT WAS FOUR DAYS OF

01:59.567 --> 02:00.233
A FULL-THROATED DENIAL OF

02:00.300 --> 02:01.433
OBJECTIVE REALITY.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.367
FOR ONE THING, THERE WAS THE

02:03.433 --> 02:04.100
MISLEADING PORTRAIT THEY PAINTED

02:04.166 --> 02:05.567
OF TRUMP'S OPPONENT.

02:05.633 --> 02:07.300
>> IF BIDEN WINS, HE'LL BE

02:07.367 --> 02:08.200
CONTROLLED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

02:08.266 --> 02:09.767
EXTREMISTS.

02:09.834 --> 02:10.967
>> WE'D BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO

02:11.033 --> 02:12.200
GOVERNMENT-RUN HEALTHCARE.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.266
>> BIDEN HAS PLEDGED TO DEFUND

02:13.333 --> 02:14.600
THE POLICE.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.533
>> AND HE'S EVEN TALKING ABOUT

02:16.600 --> 02:17.166
TAKING THE WALL DOWN, HOW ABOUT

02:17.233 --> 02:18.533
THAT?

02:18.600 --> 02:19.266
>> John: HONESTLY, THAT SOUNDS

02:19.333 --> 02:21.133
GREAT!

02:21.200 --> 02:22.467
UNFORTUNATELY BIDEN HAS PROMISED

02:22.533 --> 02:23.467
TO DO EXACTLY NONE OF THOSE

02:23.533 --> 02:24.633
THINGS.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.834
BIDEN IS A RADICAL

02:25.900 --> 02:26.767
ENVIRONMENTALIST

02:26.834 --> 02:29.000
POLICE-DEFUNDING SOCIALIST

02:29.066 --> 02:30.200
IN THE SAME WAY I'M HISTORY'S

02:30.266 --> 02:32.033
GREATEST ZAZU.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.767
YOU CAN SAY I AM ALL YOU WANT

02:33.834 --> 02:35.300
TO, AND I WISH I WERE, BUT THE

02:35.367 --> 02:37.033
FACT IS, IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO

02:37.100 --> 02:38.367
BEING TRUE.

02:38.433 --> 02:39.433
AND THE LIES TOLD ABOUT BIDEN

02:39.500 --> 02:42.767
WERE JUST THE BEGINNING.

02:42.834 --> 02:43.800
CONVENTION SPEAKERS ALSO CLAIMED

02:43.867 --> 02:44.600
THAT TRUMP NEVER CALLED WHITE

02:44.667 --> 02:45.667
SUPREMACISTS "VERY FINE PEOPLE,"

02:45.734 --> 02:46.500
WHICH HE DID; THAT HE PASSED THE

02:46.567 --> 02:47.533
VETERAN'S CHOICE ACT, WHICH HE

02:47.600 --> 02:48.467
DIDN'T; AND THAT HE'S TRYING TO

02:48.533 --> 02:49.266
PROTECT PATIENTS WITH

02:49.333 --> 02:50.367
PREEXISTING CONDITIONS,

02:50.433 --> 02:53.033
WHICH HE VERY MUCH ISN'T.

02:53.100 --> 02:53.967
I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED A SPEAKER

02:54.033 --> 02:55.200
DIDN'T AT ONE POINT CLAIM THAT

02:55.266 --> 02:56.233
TRUMP INVENTED PARAKEETS,

02:56.300 --> 02:57.166
OR THAT HE STOPPED

02:57.233 --> 02:58.834
THE MURDER HORNETS BY SUCKING

02:58.900 --> 03:00.734
THEM STRAIGHT OUT OF THE AIR.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.867
AND YET, EVEN IN THE MIDST OF

03:02.934 --> 03:04.967
A BLIZZARD OF LIES, SOME STILL

03:05.033 --> 03:05.967
MANAGED TO STAND OUT -- LIKE

03:06.033 --> 03:07.200
WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER

03:07.266 --> 03:08.300
LARRY KUDLOW REFERRING TO THE

03:08.367 --> 03:09.300
CORONAVIRUS WITH AN ODD CHOICE

03:09.367 --> 03:11.433
OF VERB TENSE.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.967
>> THEN, CAME A ONCE-IN-100-YEAR

03:13.033 --> 03:13.800
PANDEMIC.

03:13.867 --> 03:15.500
IT WAS AWFUL.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.000
HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS WERE

03:17.066 --> 03:18.900
TRAGIC.

03:18.967 --> 03:19.667
HARDSHIP AND HEARTBREAK WERE

03:19.734 --> 03:21.667
EVERYWHERE.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.533
BUT PRESIDENTIAL LEADERSHIP CAME

03:23.600 --> 03:25.900
SWIFTLY AND EFFECTIVELY, WITH AN

03:25.967 --> 03:27.133
EXTRAORDINARY RESCUE FOR HEALTH

03:27.200 --> 03:28.834
AND SAFETY TO SUCCESSFULLY FIGHT

03:28.900 --> 03:31.200
THE COVID VIRUS.

03:31.266 --> 03:32.533
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.200
YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT THE

03:34.266 --> 03:35.200
CORONAVIRUS IN THE PAST TENSE,

03:35.266 --> 03:36.266
WHEN IT IS, IN A VERY REAL

03:36.333 --> 03:38.000
SENSE, STILL RAGING.

03:38.066 --> 03:40.266
IF YOU'RE A CHARACTER IN A "SAW"

03:40.333 --> 03:42.000
MOVIE, YOU DON'T SAY, "PHEW,

03:42.066 --> 03:43.266
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE" WHILE THE

03:43.333 --> 03:45.400
BEAR TRAP IS STILL ON YOUR HEAD.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.767
BUT MAYBE THE BIGGEST GULF

03:46.867 --> 03:47.600
BETWEEN THE RNC AND OBJECTIVE

03:47.667 --> 03:49.066
REALITY CONCERNED RACE.

03:49.133 --> 03:51.266
AGAIN AND AGAIN, RNC SPEAKERS

03:51.333 --> 03:53.166
WERE AT PAINS TO REASSURE

03:53.233 --> 03:54.934
VIEWERS THAT RACISM IN AMERICA

03:55.000 --> 03:56.266
IS MOSTLY A RELIC OF THE PAST,

03:56.333 --> 03:57.533
AND WHATEVER REMAINS CAN BE

03:57.600 --> 03:59.033
EASILY OVERCOME.

03:59.100 --> 04:00.533
TAKE NIKKI HALEY'S SPEECH,

04:00.600 --> 04:02.200
IN WHICH SHE FLATLY INSISTED

04:02.266 --> 04:04.100
AMERICA IS NOT A RACIST COUNTRY,

04:04.166 --> 04:05.834
AND THEN TOLD THE INSPIRATIONAL

04:05.900 --> 04:07.266
STORY OF HOW THE CONFEDERATE

04:07.333 --> 04:08.400
FLAG AT HER STATE'S CAPITOL

04:08.467 --> 04:09.800
WAS TAKEN DOWN IN 2015

04:09.867 --> 04:10.900
AFTER THE MASSACRE AT

04:10.967 --> 04:13.300
MOTHER EMMANUEL CHURCH.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.633
>> AFTER THAT HORRIFIC TRAGEDY,

04:14.700 --> 04:15.633
WE DIDN'T TURN AGAINST

04:15.700 --> 04:17.633
EACH OTHER.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.734
WE CAME TOGETHER, BLACK AND

04:18.800 --> 04:21.000
WHITE, DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN.

04:21.066 --> 04:24.834
TOGETHER, WE MADE THE HARD

04:24.900 --> 04:26.000
CHOICES NEEDED TO HEAL, AND

04:26.066 --> 04:27.300
REMOVED A DIVISIVE SYMBOL

04:27.367 --> 04:29.567
PEACEFULLY AND RESPECTFULLY.

04:29.633 --> 04:30.633
>> John: OH, THAT'S WHAT

04:30.700 --> 04:31.567
HAPPENED, IS IT?

04:31.633 --> 04:34.033
THAT SOUNDS NICE.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.100
JUST A FEW THINGS THERE -- IT'S

04:36.166 --> 04:38.033
A PEACEFUL STORY OF UNITY AND

04:38.100 --> 04:39.467
HOPE AS LONG AS YOU START THE

04:39.533 --> 04:40.567
STORY IMMEDIATELY AFTER

04:40.633 --> 04:41.133
A WHITE SUPREMACIST KILLED

04:41.200 --> 04:41.667
NINE PEOPLE AT A HISTORIC

04:41.734 --> 04:43.467
BLACK CHURCH.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.100
ALSO, HALEY'S VERSION OF THAT

04:45.166 --> 04:46.767
STORY IGNORES THE FACT THAT

04:46.834 --> 04:47.667
THE EVENTUAL REMOVAL OF THE

04:47.734 --> 04:51.734
CONFEDERATE FLAG WAS

04:51.800 --> 04:53.066
JUMP-STARTED BY ARTIST AND

04:53.133 --> 04:54.033
ACTIVIST BREE NEWSOME BASS,

04:54.100 --> 04:55.667
CLIMBING THE FLAGPOLE IN FRONT

04:55.734 --> 04:56.433
OF THE STATE HOUSE LIKE SHE WAS

04:56.500 --> 04:57.433
ON AN ANTI-RACIST VERSION OF

04:57.500 --> 04:58.734
AMERICAN NINJA WARRIOR, AND THAT

04:58.800 --> 05:00.133
SHE WAS THEN ARRESTED, AND THAT

05:00.200 --> 05:00.934
THE FLAG WAS THEN RERAISED

05:01.000 --> 05:03.200
45 MINUTES LATER.

05:03.233 --> 05:05.266
HALEY ALSO CONVENIENTLY LEAVES

05:05.333 --> 05:07.000
OUT THE PART WHERE THE CANDIDATE

05:07.066 --> 05:08.100
SHE'S ENDORSING HAS DEFENDED

05:08.166 --> 05:13.567
THOSE WHO PROUDLY FLY THE FLAG

05:13.633 --> 05:14.367
IT REPRESENTS THE SOUTH.

05:14.433 --> 05:15.567
SO HALEY TURNING WHAT

05:15.633 --> 05:16.867
HAPPENED IN SOUTH CAROLINA INTO

05:16.934 --> 05:17.567
A SMOOTH, HOPEFUL STORY OF

05:17.633 --> 05:18.900
RACIAL RECONCILIATION IS A BIT

05:18.967 --> 05:19.600
LIKE IF SOMEONE ASKED HER WHAT

05:19.667 --> 05:22.700
THE FILM "DO THE RIGHT THING" IS

05:22.767 --> 05:23.500
ABOUT AND SHE SAID, "A BROOKLYN

05:23.567 --> 05:24.367
NEIGHBORHOOD COMES TOGETHER TO

05:24.433 --> 05:26.867
HELP REDECORATE A PIZZA PLACE."

05:26.934 --> 05:31.934
I MEAN, SURE, NIKKI, I GUESS

05:32.000 --> 05:34.367
THAT'S TECHNICALLY TRUE, BUT

05:34.433 --> 05:34.967
SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT PARTS

05:35.033 --> 05:35.633
THERE.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.934
AND A LOT OF THE RNC'S MESSAGING

05:37.000 --> 05:38.100
ON RACE SEEMED INTENDED NOT SO

05:38.166 --> 05:39.200
MUCH TO WIN OVER BLACK VOTERS

05:39.266 --> 05:40.900
AS TO REASSURE WHITE PEOPLE

05:40.967 --> 05:41.600
THAT THEY COULD VOTE REPUBLICAN

05:41.667 --> 05:42.900
WITHOUT BEING RACIST.

05:42.967 --> 05:43.767
THE AUDIENCE THEY WERE TALKING

05:43.834 --> 05:45.233
TO WAS PRETTY CLEAR, EVEN IN

05:45.300 --> 05:46.700
SMALL MOMENTS LIKE THIS:

05:46.767 --> 05:49.200
>> THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW

05:49.266 --> 05:50.934
WE DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

05:51.000 --> 05:52.834
SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

05:52.900 --> 05:54.333
STANDING WITH OUR

05:54.400 --> 05:56.700
AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORS.

05:56.767 --> 05:59.633
>> John: WELL, HOLD ON, MIKE.

05:59.700 --> 06:00.533
WHO IS THE "WE" IN THAT

06:00.600 --> 06:01.467
SENTENCE?

06:01.533 --> 06:02.767
BECAUSE IT SEEMS YOU'RE MAKING

06:02.834 --> 06:04.100
A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

06:04.166 --> 06:04.734
"WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE" AND

06:04.800 --> 06:05.266
"OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN

06:05.333 --> 06:05.767
NEIGHBORS," WHO I GUESS,

06:05.834 --> 06:07.033
BY EXTENSION, ARE SOMEHOW

06:07.100 --> 06:08.633
A DIFFERENT GROUP ENTIRELY.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.166
BUT I GUESS THAT SENTIMENT

06:11.233 --> 06:12.200
SHOULDN'T BE REALLY SURPRISING,

06:12.266 --> 06:13.233
COMING FROM MIKE PENCE,

06:13.300 --> 06:14.000
A MAN WHO PERMANENTLY LOOKS LIKE

06:14.066 --> 06:14.567
HE SHOULD BE LIVING IN

06:14.633 --> 06:15.600
"KEN'S WHITE FLIGHT

06:15.667 --> 06:16.900
DREAM HOUSE."

06:16.967 --> 06:18.734
AND ALL OF THIS OVERT TALK OF

06:18.800 --> 06:20.600
RACIAL HARMONY WAS VERY MUCH IN

06:20.667 --> 06:22.200
CONFLICT WITH THE STEADY DIET OF

06:22.266 --> 06:25.734
BARELY-DISGUISED RACIAL PANIC

06:25.800 --> 06:26.533
THAT VIEWERS WERE ALSO BEING

06:26.600 --> 06:27.767
FED.

06:27.834 --> 06:30.100
PERHAPS THE MOST FLAGRANT

06:30.166 --> 06:31.000
EXAMPLE OF THIS CAME ON MONDAY

06:31.066 --> 06:32.934
NIGHT, WHEN THE RNC CHOSE TO

06:33.000 --> 06:34.433
FEATURE THE ST. LOUIS COUPLE

06:34.500 --> 06:35.233
WHO WAS CHARGED WITH THREATENING

06:35.300 --> 06:36.300
BLACK LIVES MATTER PROTESTORS

06:36.367 --> 06:36.967
AT GUNPOINT LAST MONTH.

06:37.033 --> 06:38.400
AND THE MESSAGE THEY WERE THERE

06:38.467 --> 06:39.934
TO SEND WAS PRETTY CLEAR.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.433
>> IT SEEMS AS IF THE DEMOCRATS

06:41.500 --> 06:44.233
NO LONGER VIEW THE GOVERNMENT'S

06:44.300 --> 06:46.433
JOB AS PROTECTING HONEST

06:46.500 --> 06:47.600
CITIZENS FROM CRIMINALS, BUT

06:47.667 --> 06:48.300
RATHER PROTECTING CRIMINALS FROM

06:48.367 --> 06:49.333
HONEST CITIZENS.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.367
>> THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH

06:51.433 --> 06:52.066
SPREADING THE CHAOS AND VIOLENCE

06:52.133 --> 06:54.166
INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.

06:54.233 --> 06:55.934
THEY WANT TO ABOLISH THE SUBURBS

06:56.000 --> 06:57.500
ALL TOGETHER BY ENDING

06:57.567 --> 06:59.767
SINGLE-FAMILY HOME ZONING.

06:59.834 --> 07:00.900
THIS FORCED REZONING WOULD BRING

07:00.967 --> 07:03.200
CRIME, LAWLESSNESS, AND

07:03.266 --> 07:04.700
LOW-QUALITY APARTMENTS INTO

07:04.767 --> 07:05.166
NOW-THRIVING SUBURBAN

07:05.233 --> 07:06.567
NEIGHBORHOODS.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.567
SO MAKE NO MISTAKE.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.266
NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, YOUR

07:10.333 --> 07:11.800
FAMILY WILL NOT BE SAFE IN THE

07:11.867 --> 07:14.467
RADICAL DEMOCRATS' AMERICA.

07:14.533 --> 07:18.333
>> John: WOW.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.734
OKAY, FIRST, C-SPAN, YOU REALLY

07:19.800 --> 07:20.400
DIDN'T NEED TO PUT UP THE BANNER

07:20.467 --> 07:20.967
THAT SAYS THEY'RE "PERSONAL

07:21.033 --> 07:23.834
INJURY ATTORNEYS," I VERY MUCH

07:23.900 --> 07:25.266
GOT THAT FROM THE EVERYTHING.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.100
BUT MUCH MORE IMPORTANTLY,

07:26.166 --> 07:26.734
THINK ABOUT HOW INCENDIARY THAT

07:26.800 --> 07:28.233
MESSAGE IS.

07:28.300 --> 07:29.800
"VIOLENCE AND CRIMINALS ARE

07:29.867 --> 07:31.000
COMING TO YOUR COMMUNITY IN THE

07:31.066 --> 07:31.800
FORM OF "LOW-QUALITY

07:31.867 --> 07:32.800
APARTMENTS," AND YOU MUST DEFEND

07:32.867 --> 07:33.767
YOURSELF.

07:33.800 --> 07:35.200
TAKE IT FROM US, THE COUPLE

07:35.266 --> 07:35.867
WHO POINTED GUNS AT

07:35.934 --> 07:38.333
BLACK LIVES MATTERS PROTESTORS."

07:38.400 --> 07:41.433
AND RHETORIC LIKE THAT HAS

07:41.500 --> 07:43.000
CONSEQUENCES.

07:43.066 --> 07:44.900
WHICH ACTUALLY BRING US TO THE

07:44.967 --> 07:46.800
SECOND PART OF OUR STORY THIS

07:46.867 --> 07:48.166
WEEK: WHAT HAPPENED IN KENOSHA,

07:48.233 --> 07:49.567
WISCONSIN, WHERE -- TO REITERATE

07:49.633 --> 07:51.000
-- JACOB BLAKE WAS SHOT SEVEN

07:51.066 --> 07:52.467
TIMES IN THE BACK BY POLICE,

07:52.533 --> 07:53.066
WITH THREE OF HIS CHILDREN

07:53.133 --> 07:54.033
IN THE CAR.

07:54.100 --> 07:55.433
AND THEN, IN THE PROTESTS THAT

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
FOLLOWED, KYLE RITTENHOUSE,

07:57.567 --> 07:58.900
A 17-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD TRAVELED

07:58.967 --> 08:00.033
THERE FROM OUT OF STATE, AND WAS

08:00.100 --> 08:01.066
ILLEGALLY CARRYING A WEAPON,

08:01.133 --> 08:02.333
KILLED TWO PEOPLE.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.800
AND LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF HE SAW

08:04.867 --> 08:05.934
THE McCLOSKEYS SPEAK THE NIGHT

08:06.000 --> 08:07.834
BEFORE HE CHOSE TO DRIVE TO

08:07.900 --> 08:09.166
A CITY HE DIDN'T LIVE IN, TO

08:09.233 --> 08:11.300
DEFEND PROPERTY HE DIDN'T OWN.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.166
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT HE WAS

08:13.233 --> 08:14.367
AN AVID TRUMP SUPPORTER, EVEN

08:14.433 --> 08:16.633
SITTING FRONT ROW AT A RALLY

08:16.700 --> 08:17.433
BACK IN JANUARY.

08:17.500 --> 08:18.700
AND TRUMP AND HIS MEDIA

08:18.767 --> 08:20.266
ECOSYSTEM HAVE BEEN DELIVERING

08:20.333 --> 08:21.367
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MESSAGE AS

08:21.433 --> 08:23.333
THE McCLOSKEYS FOR YEARS NOW.

08:23.400 --> 08:25.133
JUST LOOK AT HOW QUICKLY

08:25.200 --> 08:26.033
TUCKER CARLSON MOVED TO TRY AND

08:26.100 --> 08:27.367
EXPLAIN AWAY RITTENHOUSE'S

08:27.433 --> 08:29.500
ACTIONS AS A NATURAL RESPONSE.

08:29.567 --> 08:30.967
>> SO ARE WE REALLY SURPRISED

08:31.033 --> 08:32.633
THAT LOOTING AND ARSON

08:32.700 --> 08:34.767
ACCELERATED TO MURDER?

08:34.834 --> 08:36.333
HOW SHOCKED ARE WE THAT

08:36.400 --> 08:37.734
17-YEAR-OLDS WITH RIFLES DECIDED

08:37.800 --> 08:38.633
THEY HAD TO MAINTAIN ORDER WHEN

08:38.700 --> 08:41.300
NO ONE ELSE WOULD?

08:41.367 --> 08:43.834
>> John: WELL, YOU DON'T SEEM TO

08:43.900 --> 08:44.834
BE SHOCKED, AND THAT ALONE

08:44.900 --> 08:45.367
SHOULD BE PRETTY FUCKING

08:45.433 --> 08:46.834
SHOCKING.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.900
LET'S BE CLEAR: A 17-YEAR-OLD

08:48.967 --> 08:50.533
VIGILANTE WITH A RIFLE CANNOT

08:50.600 --> 08:52.367
MAINTAIN ORDER, BECAUSE

08:52.433 --> 08:53.567
A 17-YEAR-OLD VIGILANTE WITH

08:53.633 --> 08:55.000
A RIFLE TRYING TO MAINTAIN ORDER

08:55.066 --> 08:56.033
IS, HIMSELF, THE DEFINITION OF

08:56.100 --> 08:58.066
DISORDER.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.100
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, IF YOU'RE

09:00.166 --> 09:00.734
A REGULAR VIEWER OF

09:00.800 --> 09:01.667
TUCKER CARLSON, A SHOW THAT

09:01.734 --> 09:02.767
EXISTS TO TEACH ITS VIEWERS

09:02.834 --> 09:03.867
PRECISELY THREE THINGS:

09:03.934 --> 09:05.867
PROPERTY DAMAGE IS VIOLENCE,

09:05.934 --> 09:07.967
HOMICIDE IS ORDER,

09:08.033 --> 09:10.500
AND PILLOWS ARE FOR SALE.

09:10.567 --> 09:12.667
AND THE EVENTS IN KENOSHA REALLY

09:12.734 --> 09:13.633
HAMMER HOME THE FLAGRANT DOUBLE

09:13.700 --> 09:14.600
STANDARD BAKED INTO AMERICAN

09:14.667 --> 09:15.667
SOCIETY.

09:15.734 --> 09:17.367
JUST LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE

09:17.433 --> 09:18.567
IN HOW THE POLICE IN KENOSHA

09:18.633 --> 09:20.000
RESPONDED TO BLAKE, AND HOW THEY

09:20.066 --> 09:21.133
RESPONDED TO RITTENHOUSE.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.133
>> ALLEGED GUNMAN

09:23.200 --> 09:24.500
KYLE RITTENHOUSE WALKING AWAY,

09:24.567 --> 09:25.967
GUN IN TOW, AS PEOPLE SCREAMED

09:26.033 --> 09:28.200
THAT HE JUST SHOT PROTESTERS.

09:28.266 --> 09:30.133
ONE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER,

09:30.200 --> 09:32.567
SEEMING TO ASK RITTENHOUSE

09:32.633 --> 09:34.467
IF ANYONE WAS HURT.

09:34.533 --> 09:36.033
TWO INCIDENTS, TWO VIDEOS,

09:36.100 --> 09:37.266
WITH SOME ASKING WHY TWO

09:37.333 --> 09:38.734
DIFFERENT RESPONSES.

09:38.800 --> 09:39.834
>> John: WHY TWO DIFFERENT

09:39.900 --> 09:41.033
RESPONSES?

09:41.100 --> 09:42.000
I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT IS

09:42.066 --> 09:43.533
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

09:43.600 --> 09:44.800
IT'S THE SAME REASON WHY, AHEAD

09:44.867 --> 09:45.934
OF THE SHOOTING, THERE WAS VIDEO

09:46.000 --> 09:47.767
OF THE POLICE TRYING TO ENFORCE

09:47.834 --> 09:49.467
A CURFEW AGAINST PROTESTORS,

09:49.533 --> 09:51.333
EVEN AS THEY OFFERED WATER TO

09:51.400 --> 09:52.200
RITTENHOUSE AND THE MILITIA,

09:52.266 --> 09:53.400
SAYING, AND I QUOTE,

09:53.467 --> 09:54.200
"WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS,

09:54.266 --> 09:57.867
WE REALLY DO."

09:57.934 --> 09:58.867
IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A BETTER

09:58.934 --> 09:59.533
VISUAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE

09:59.600 --> 10:00.467
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEING BLACK

10:00.533 --> 10:02.166
AND WHITE IN AMERICA, I DON'T

10:02.233 --> 10:04.233
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO FIND ONE,

10:04.266 --> 10:05.734
EXCEPT MAYBE FOR SEEING EXACTLY

10:05.800 --> 10:07.433
WHO SITS DOWN AND WHO STANDS UP

10:07.500 --> 10:08.300
WHEN "COTTON EYED JOE" COMES ON

10:08.367 --> 10:10.200
AT A WEDDING.

10:10.266 --> 10:11.367
AND THAT DISPARITY IN TREATMENT

10:11.433 --> 10:12.834
CONTINUED EVEN AFTER THE

10:12.900 --> 10:14.600
SHOOTINGS -- JUST WATCH HOW,

10:14.667 --> 10:16.367
THE NEXT DAY, THE KENOSHA POLICE

10:16.433 --> 10:18.467
CHIEF COULDN'T HELP BUT SPREAD

10:18.533 --> 10:19.300
BLAME TO THE PROTESTORS WHO WERE

10:19.367 --> 10:20.934
SHOT AT AND KILLED.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.367
>> EVERYBODY INVOLVED WAS OUT

10:22.433 --> 10:23.934
AFTER THE CURFEW.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.567
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

10:24.633 --> 10:26.033
A GREAT DEAL OF IT.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.367
BUT THE POINT IS, THE CURFEW'S

10:27.433 --> 10:28.867
IN PLACE TO PROTECT.

10:28.934 --> 10:31.300
HAD PERSONS NOT BEEN OUT

10:31.367 --> 10:32.500
INVOLVED, IN VIOLATION OF THAT,

10:32.567 --> 10:33.567
PERHAPS THE SITUATION THAT

10:33.633 --> 10:34.367
THAT UNFOLDED WOULD NOT

10:34.433 --> 10:36.266
HAVE HAPPENED.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.734
>> John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

10:37.800 --> 10:38.467
THANKS SO MUCH FOR NOT MAKING

10:38.533 --> 10:40.266
A GREAT DEAL OUT OF THAT.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.567
THE PEOPLE WHO GOT MURDERED

10:41.633 --> 10:43.033
WERE UP WAY PAST THEIR

10:43.100 --> 10:44.533
GOVERNMENT-IMPOSED BEDTIME AND

10:44.600 --> 10:46.934
YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH NOT TO EVEN

10:47.000 --> 10:47.567
MENTION IT EXCEPT TO IMPLY THAT

10:47.633 --> 10:48.200
MAYBE IT WAS A REASON THEY KIND

10:48.266 --> 10:50.667
OF HAD IT COMING.

10:50.734 --> 10:52.000
THAT IS THE KIND OF RESTRAINT

10:52.066 --> 10:52.700
WE'VE ALL COME TO EXPECT FROM

10:52.767 --> 10:53.533
THE KENOSHA POLICE DEPARTMENT.

10:53.600 --> 10:57.367
AND YOU MIGHT THINK,

10:57.433 --> 10:58.033
"WELL, HOLD ON, THAT'S JUST ONE

10:58.100 --> 10:58.600
GUY.

10:58.667 --> 10:59.200
SURELY NOT ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT

10:59.266 --> 11:00.433
THERE THINKS THAT WAY."

11:00.500 --> 11:01.867
ALTHOUGH, I WILL POINT OUT THAT

11:01.934 --> 11:02.934
THE GUY STANDING NEXT TO HIM IS

11:03.000 --> 11:04.667
THE KENOSHA SHERIFF, WHO, JUST

11:04.734 --> 11:05.834
TWO YEARS AGO, GAVE A PRETTY

11:05.900 --> 11:08.166
STRIKING PRESS CONFERENCE.

11:08.233 --> 11:09.967
A GROUP OF FIVE YOUNG BLACK

11:10.033 --> 11:11.567
PEOPLE HAD ALLEGEDLY STOLEN SOME

11:11.633 --> 11:12.567
CLOTHING FROM AN OUTLET MALL AND

11:12.633 --> 11:13.400
HAD LED POLICE ON A CHASE THAT

11:13.467 --> 11:15.266
ENDED IN A MINOR CAR ACCIDENT.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.400
AND IN THAT PRESS CONFERENCE,

11:17.467 --> 11:18.233
HE EXPRESSED SOME VIEWS THAT ARE

11:18.300 --> 11:19.233
PRETTY EXPLICIT.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.333
>> LET'S PUT THEM IN JAIL.

11:21.400 --> 11:25.266
LET'S -- LET'S STOP THEM FROM

11:25.333 --> 11:26.500
TRULY -- AT LEAST SOME OF THESE

11:26.567 --> 11:28.433
MALES GOING OUT AND GETTING

11:28.500 --> 11:29.000
TEN OTHER WOMEN PREGNANT AND

11:29.066 --> 11:30.567
HAVING SMALL CHILDREN.

11:30.633 --> 11:34.233
LET'S PUT THEM AWAY.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.567
AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO STOP

11:35.633 --> 11:39.000
BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.400
>> John: SORRY, CAN I QUICKLY

11:40.467 --> 11:40.867
INTERRUPT YOU THERE?

11:40.934 --> 11:41.467
BECAUSE CALLING FOR AMERICAN

11:41.533 --> 11:43.300
CITIZENS TO BE STOPPED FROM

11:43.367 --> 11:44.500
"HAVING SMALL CHILDREN" ISN'T

11:44.567 --> 11:45.600
"POLITICALLY INCORRECT," SO MUCH

11:45.667 --> 11:47.700
AS "POLITICALLY 1940s GERMANY."

11:47.767 --> 11:49.967
AND HE WASN'T JUST IDLY SAYING

11:50.033 --> 11:50.767
THAT -- HE HAD REALLY THOUGHT

11:50.834 --> 11:54.600
THROUGH A WHOLE PLAN.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.967
I KNOW IT IS DEEPLY UNPLEASANT,

11:56.033 --> 11:57.133
BUT IT'S WORTH LISTENING TO JUST

11:57.200 --> 11:58.567
HOW DETAILED HIS SOLUTION WAS.

11:58.633 --> 12:01.233
>> IF THERE'S A THRESHOLD THAT

12:01.300 --> 12:01.967
THEY CROSS, THESE PEOPLE HAVE

12:02.033 --> 12:05.433
TO BE WAREHOUSED.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.767
NO RECREATIONAL TIME IN THE

12:06.834 --> 12:09.900
JAILS, WE PUT THEM AWAY.

12:09.967 --> 12:12.967
AND MAYBE WE'VE GOT TO DO IS

12:13.033 --> 12:14.133
BUILD WAREHOUSES THAT, AFTER

12:14.200 --> 12:14.633
THIS GENERATION IS GONE,

12:14.700 --> 12:15.800
THEY'VE PERISHED IN THESE

12:15.867 --> 12:16.700
BUILDINGS, WE CAN TURN THEM

12:16.767 --> 12:17.567
INTO SOMETHING ELSE.

12:17.633 --> 12:21.166
MAYBE IT'LL BE MALLS.

12:21.233 --> 12:22.333
MAYBE, MAYBE AMAZON WILL BUY 'EM

12:22.400 --> 12:26.066
AS -- AS WAREHOUSES LATER.

12:26.133 --> 12:29.066
BUT AT SOME POINT, WE HAVE TO

12:29.133 --> 12:30.000
GET RID OF THIS GROUP OF --

12:30.066 --> 12:31.200
WE HAVE TO LOCK THEM UP.

12:31.266 --> 12:32.500
I DON'T THINK I'M SAYING

12:32.567 --> 12:34.633
ANYTHING DIFFERENT THAN MOST

12:34.667 --> 12:36.100
PEOPLE IN SOCIETY AREN'T

12:36.166 --> 12:37.433
THINKING, BUT THEY'RE AFRAID TO

12:37.500 --> 12:39.367
SAY IT AND I'M JUST TO THE POINT

12:39.433 --> 12:43.400
THAT I'M -- I'M SAYING IT.

12:43.467 --> 12:44.200
>> John: OKAY, IF THAT IS WHAT

12:44.266 --> 12:45.100
MOST PEOPLE IN SOCIETY ARE

12:45.166 --> 12:46.200
THINKING, WE ARE, AND THIS IS

12:46.266 --> 12:49.367
TRUE, A TERRIBLE SOCIETY.

12:49.433 --> 12:50.367
AND I HONESTLY CANNOT BELIEVE

12:50.433 --> 12:50.867
THAT WAS AN IDEA FROM A

12:50.934 --> 12:51.467
STILL-EMPLOYED SHERIFF,

12:51.533 --> 12:52.633
AND NOT A PITCH FROM

12:52.700 --> 12:53.433
"SHARK TANK:

12:53.500 --> 12:56.266
LIGHT GENOCIDE EDITION."

12:56.333 --> 12:57.734
"GOOD QUESTION, MARK CUBAN.

12:57.800 --> 12:58.700
THE ANSWER IS, THESE

12:58.767 --> 12:59.367
CONCENTRATION CAMPS COULD EASILY

12:59.433 --> 13:00.033
BE CONVERTED INTO

13:00.100 --> 13:00.967
AMAZON WAREHOUSES.

13:01.033 --> 13:02.133
OOH!

13:02.200 --> 13:03.200
LOOKS LIKE I'VE GOT A BIDDING

13:03.266 --> 13:05.533
WAR ON MY HANDS!"

13:05.600 --> 13:06.533
AND LOOK, THE EVENTS IN KENOSHA

13:06.600 --> 13:07.066
WOULD BE INFURIATING

13:07.133 --> 13:08.433
AT ANY TIME.

13:08.500 --> 13:10.133
BUT IT'S SOMEHOW ESPECIALLY

13:10.200 --> 13:12.800
INFURIATING THAT THEY TOOK PLACE

13:12.867 --> 13:17.333
IN THE SAME WEEK WHERE THE RNC

13:17.400 --> 13:19.367
DESPERATE TO REASSURE THE

13:19.433 --> 13:20.100
COUNTRY THAT AMERICA ISN'T

13:20.166 --> 13:20.333
RACIST,

13:20.400 --> 13:21.400
WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY

13:21.467 --> 13:22.367
FEARMONGERING ABOUT VIOLENT

13:22.433 --> 13:23.934
CRIME THREATENING LAW-ABIDING

13:24.000 --> 13:25.967
CITIZENS.

13:26.033 --> 13:26.834
IT'S A DISCONNECT THAT WAS

13:26.900 --> 13:28.000
PRETTY WELL SUMMED UP BY NBA

13:28.066 --> 13:30.200
COACH DOC RIVERS IN AN EMOTIONAL

13:30.266 --> 13:33.533
POSTGAME PRESS CONFERENCE

13:33.600 --> 13:34.533
ON TUESDAY.

13:34.600 --> 13:35.900
>> WHAT STANDS OUT TO ME IS

13:35.967 --> 13:41.734
JUST -- JUST WATCHING THE

13:41.800 --> 13:42.467
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION,

13:42.533 --> 13:43.700
AND THEY'RE -- THEY'RE SPEWING

13:43.767 --> 13:44.734
THIS FEAR.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.400
RIGHT?

13:46.467 --> 13:47.633
LIKE, ALL YOU HEAR IS

13:47.700 --> 13:48.467
DONALD TRUMP AND ALL OF THEM

13:48.533 --> 13:49.433
TALKING ABOUT FEAR.

13:49.500 --> 13:50.333
WE'RE THE ONES GETTING KILLED.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.400
WE'RE THE ONES GETTING SHOT.

13:51.433 --> 13:53.233
WE'RE THE ONES THAT --

13:53.266 --> 13:53.967
WE'RE DENIED TO LIVE

13:54.033 --> 13:56.600
IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.433
WE'VE BEEN HUNG.

13:58.500 --> 14:04.133
WE'VE BEEN SHOT.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.433
AND ALL YOU DO IS KEEP HEARING

14:05.500 --> 14:11.233
ABOUT FEAR.

14:11.300 --> 14:14.467
IT'S -- IT'S AMAZING TO ME WHY

14:14.533 --> 14:18.367
WE KEEP LOVING THIS COUNTRY AND

14:18.433 --> 14:19.400
THIS COUNTRY DOES NOT LOVE US

14:19.467 --> 14:20.567
BACK.

14:20.633 --> 14:22.734
>> John: YEAH, EXACTLY.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.567
IT'S ALL EXHAUSTINGLY

14:24.633 --> 14:25.900
DEPRESSING.

14:25.967 --> 14:27.300
ALTHOUGH IN A WEEK OF INCREDIBLE

14:27.367 --> 14:29.700
DARKNESS, THERE WAS ACTUALLY

14:29.767 --> 14:31.500
A BRIGHT SPOT, BECAUSE SHORTLY

14:31.567 --> 14:32.767
AFTER DOC RIVERS SPOKE,

14:32.834 --> 14:33.867
SOMETHING GENUINELY

14:33.934 --> 14:34.867
EXTRAORDINARY STARTED

14:34.934 --> 14:36.166
TO HAPPEN IN HIS SPORT.

14:36.233 --> 14:37.633
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS HAD

14:37.700 --> 14:39.600
A PLAYOFF GAME, BUT DIDN'T TAKE

14:39.667 --> 14:40.767
THE COURT, WITH RUMORS FLYING

14:40.834 --> 14:41.467
AROUND THAT THEY WERE ABOUT TO

14:41.533 --> 14:42.734
REFUSE TO PLAY.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.066
THEN, WNBA PLAYERS -- WHO,

14:44.133 --> 14:45.166
INCIDENTALLY, HAVE LED FROM THE

14:45.233 --> 14:46.800
START ON THE BLACK LIVES MATTER

14:46.867 --> 14:48.667
MOVEMENT -- ALSO REFUSED TO

14:48.734 --> 14:49.667
PLAY, AFTER ARRIVING AT

14:49.734 --> 14:51.033
A SCHEDULED GAME WITH SHIRTS

14:51.100 --> 14:52.066
WITH SEVEN BULLET HOLES DRAWN

14:52.133 --> 14:54.533
ON THEIR BACK.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.300
AND EVENTUALLY, WILDCAT STRIKES

14:56.367 --> 14:57.500
SPREAD THROUGHOUT BOTH LEAGUES,

14:57.567 --> 14:59.467
IN AN UNPRECEDENTED, GENUINELY

14:59.533 --> 15:00.200
INSPIRING SHOW OF COLLECTIVE

15:00.266 --> 15:01.367
ACTION.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.066
AND THEY DID THIS WITHOUT UNION

15:03.133 --> 15:05.300
APPROVAL, SO THEY WERE PUTTING

15:05.367 --> 15:06.600
A LOT ON THE LINE -- THEIR

15:06.667 --> 15:07.300
INCOME, AND MAYBE EVEN

15:07.367 --> 15:08.400
THEIR CAREERS.

15:08.467 --> 15:10.133
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO

15:10.200 --> 15:11.333
INFURIATING THAT WHEN

15:11.400 --> 15:13.100
JARED KUSHNER WAS ASKED FOR HIS

15:13.166 --> 15:14.400
RESPONSE TO THE STRIKE, THIS WAS

15:14.467 --> 15:16.600
WHAT FELL OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.066
>> LOOK, I THINK THAT THE NBA

15:18.133 --> 15:20.066
PLAYERS ARE VERY FORTUNATE THAT

15:20.133 --> 15:20.967
THEY HAVE THE FINANCIAL POSITION

15:21.033 --> 15:22.200
WHERE THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE

15:22.266 --> 15:23.600
A NIGHT OFF FROM WORK WITHOUT

15:23.667 --> 15:24.967
HAVING TO -- TO HAVE THE

15:25.033 --> 15:25.834
CONSEQUENCES TO THEMSELVES

15:25.900 --> 15:26.467
FINANCIALLY.

15:26.533 --> 15:27.300
SO THEY HAVE THAT LUXURY,

15:27.367 --> 15:28.934
WHICH IS GREAT.

15:29.000 --> 15:33.266
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, GET

15:33.333 --> 15:35.200
FUCKED, JARED, YOU "WELCOME TO

15:35.266 --> 15:35.800
MARWEN" REJECT.

15:35.867 --> 15:36.900
FOR A START, THEY'RE NOT TAKING

15:36.967 --> 15:37.367
A NIGHT OFF FROM WORK.

15:37.433 --> 15:38.533
THE EMOTIONAL TOLL OF BEING

15:38.600 --> 15:39.934
BLACK IN AMERICA COMBINED

15:40.000 --> 15:40.567
WITH THE PRESSURE T PERFORM AT

15:40.633 --> 15:42.233
AN ELITE LEVEL DURING A

15:42.300 --> 15:43.200
GLOBAL PANDEMIC IS, I'M

15:43.266 --> 15:45.000
GUESSING, PRETTY TAXING.

15:45.066 --> 15:46.900
SO BY NOT PLAYING, THEY'RE

15:46.967 --> 15:49.500
NOT EXACTLY TAKING A SPA DAY.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.033
AND IF NBA PLAYERS ARE TOO RICH

15:51.100 --> 15:53.000
TO TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION,

15:53.066 --> 15:53.734
THEN WHO EXACTLY IS IN THE RIGHT

15:53.800 --> 15:55.233
TAX BRACKET TO HAVE THEIR

15:55.300 --> 15:56.900
PROTEST APPROVED BY AMERICA'S

15:56.967 --> 15:58.900
MOST LAMINATED PRINCE?

15:58.967 --> 16:01.233
BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN TIME AND TIME

16:01.300 --> 16:02.867
AGAIN THAT WEALTH AND FAME

16:02.934 --> 16:03.834
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT PROTECT YOU

16:03.900 --> 16:06.233
AS A BLACK ATHLETE.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.800
IT DIDN'T PROTECT STERLING BROWN

16:07.867 --> 16:08.834
FROM GETTING TASED BY THE POLICE

16:08.900 --> 16:10.066
AFTER BEING STOPPED FOR

16:10.133 --> 16:11.467
A PARKING VIOLATION IN

16:11.533 --> 16:13.000
MILWAUKEE, AND IT DIDN'T PROTECT

16:13.066 --> 16:15.233
THABO SEFOLOSHA FROM HAVING HIS

16:15.300 --> 16:17.066
LEG BROKEN BY NYPD OFFICERS IN

16:17.133 --> 16:18.700
AN INCIDENT THAT FORCED HIM TO

16:18.767 --> 16:20.166
MISS THE 2015 PLAYOFFS AND PUT

16:20.233 --> 16:21.834
HIS WHOLE CAREER IN JEOPARDY.

16:21.900 --> 16:23.900
AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO STRAP IN,

16:23.967 --> 16:25.100
JARED, BECAUSE THIS PROBABLY

16:25.166 --> 16:26.066
ISN'T THE LAST DISRUPTIVE ACTION

16:26.133 --> 16:26.967
LIKE THIS WE'RE GOING TO SEE

16:27.033 --> 16:27.967
GOING FORWARD -- NOR SHOULD IT

16:28.033 --> 16:29.967
BE.

16:30.033 --> 16:30.967
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF

16:31.033 --> 16:32.233
WAITING.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.900
JUST LISTEN TO JACOB BLAKE'S

16:33.967 --> 16:34.967
SISTER, LETETRA WIDMAN, MAKING

16:35.033 --> 16:36.633
THAT VERY CLEAR.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.967
>> I'M NOT SAD.

16:38.033 --> 16:39.166
I'M NOT SORRY.

16:39.233 --> 16:41.000
I'M ANGRY.

16:41.066 --> 16:44.133
AND I'M TIRED.

16:44.200 --> 16:46.033
I HAVEN'T CRIED ONE TIME.

16:46.100 --> 16:48.667
I STOPPED CRYING YEARS AGO.

16:48.734 --> 16:51.467
I AM NUMB.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.433
I HAVE BEEN WATCHING POLICE

16:53.500 --> 16:54.700
MURDER PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE

16:54.767 --> 16:56.200
ME FOR YEARS.

16:56.266 --> 16:56.934
I'M NOT SAD.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.300
I DON'T WANT YOUR PITY.

16:58.367 --> 17:01.867
I WANT CHANGE.

17:01.934 --> 17:03.266
>> John: RIGHT.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.633
THIS CAN'T BE ABOUT PITY.

17:04.700 --> 17:09.233
IT CAN'T BE ABOUT SYMPATHY.

17:09.300 --> 17:10.967
THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO SECTION

17:11.033 --> 17:11.834
IN THE GREETING CARDS STORE

17:11.934 --> 17:12.633
LABELED "CENTURIES OF

17:12.700 --> 17:13.166
OPPRESSION."

17:13.233 --> 17:13.867
THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHAT

17:13.934 --> 17:14.667
WHITE PEOPLE FEEL OR SAY.

17:14.734 --> 17:15.934
THIS HAS TO BE ABOUT CREATING

17:16.000 --> 17:16.734
REAL CHANGE IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS

17:16.800 --> 17:19.133
BEEN BUILT TO BE NON-RESPONSIVE.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.533
BECAUSE HISTORY HAS REPEATEDLY

17:20.600 --> 17:24.367
SHOWN THE SYSTEM DOESN'T RESPOND

17:24.433 --> 17:25.700
UNTIL IT IS FORCED TO.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.367
SO IT'S EASY FOR RNC SPEAKERS

17:27.433 --> 17:28.667
TO INSIST THE ONLY APPROPRIATE

17:28.734 --> 17:29.600
ACTION IS PEACEFUL AND

17:29.667 --> 17:30.734
UNOBTRUSIVE.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.233
BUT THE FACT IS, THAT'S NOT HOW

17:32.300 --> 17:34.600
IT WORKS.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.066
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE MARCHED

17:36.133 --> 17:37.233
IN THE WAKE OF GEORGE FLOYD'S

17:37.300 --> 17:38.934
DEATH, AND HAVE CONTINUED

17:39.033 --> 17:40.166
MARCHING, EVEN AS MEDIA COVERAGE

17:40.233 --> 17:41.867
HAS STEADILY DRIFTED AWAY.

17:41.934 --> 17:43.367
MEANWHILE, THE NBA HAS MADE

17:43.433 --> 17:45.200
A LOT OF SYMBOLIC GESTURES OF

17:45.266 --> 17:46.900
SUPPORT FOR THE MOVEMENT, LIKE

17:46.967 --> 17:47.734
PAINTING "BLACK LIVES MATTER"

17:47.800 --> 17:49.100
ON THE COURT AND ALLOWING

17:49.166 --> 17:50.266
PLAYERS TO WEAR A SOCIAL JUSTICE

17:50.333 --> 17:53.066
MESSAGE ON THEIR JERSEYS,

17:53.133 --> 17:54.233
SELECTED FROM A LIST OF

17:54.300 --> 17:56.033
29 AGREED-UPON OPTIONS.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.667
BUT TO UNDERSCORE JUST HOW

17:57.734 --> 17:59.567
LIMITING THAT KIND OF

17:59.633 --> 18:01.166
"PREAPPROVED" PROTEST CAN BE,

18:01.233 --> 18:03.567
"SAY HER NAME" WAS ON THE LIST,

18:03.633 --> 18:05.200
BUT "BREONNA TAYLOR" WAS NOT.

18:05.266 --> 18:07.033
AND I GUESS THE ONLY POSITIVE

18:07.100 --> 18:08.100
THING THERE IS, IF PLAYERS

18:08.166 --> 18:09.834
WANTED TO PROTEST THAT

18:09.900 --> 18:10.734
RESTRICTION, THE NBA HAD

18:10.800 --> 18:12.934
A JERSEY READY MADE FOR THEM.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.834
THE PROBLEM WITH PURELY SYMBOLIC

18:14.900 --> 18:16.433
PROTEST IS THAT IT'S FAR TOO

18:16.500 --> 18:18.100
EASY TO CO-OPT.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.333
THERE MIGHT BE NO MORE VISCERAL

18:20.400 --> 18:21.567
EXAMPLE OF THAT THAN THE FACT

18:21.633 --> 18:23.834
THAT THAT KENOSHA SHERIFF AND

18:23.900 --> 18:25.767
HUMAN WAREHOUSING INNOVATOR GOT

18:25.834 --> 18:27.100
POSITIVE ATTENTION EARLIER THIS

18:27.166 --> 18:28.767
YEAR WHEN HE KNEELED FOR NINE

18:28.834 --> 18:29.967
MINUTES IN SOLIDARITY WITH

18:30.033 --> 18:33.467
THE BLACK LIVES MATTER MOVEMENT.

18:33.533 --> 18:34.767
SO IS IT ANY WONDER THAT

18:34.834 --> 18:36.467
BASKETBALL PLAYERS FELT THEY HAD

18:36.533 --> 18:38.633
TO ESCALATE THEIR PROTEST BY NOT

18:38.700 --> 18:41.633
JUST WEARING A JERSEY, BUT

18:41.700 --> 18:46.033
BY STRIKING --

18:46.100 --> 18:49.100
AND IN DOING SO, PUTTING TEAM

18:49.166 --> 18:50.400
OWNERS MONEY AT JEOPARDY.

18:50.467 --> 18:51.333
BECAUSE REAL DISCOMFORT IS THE

18:51.400 --> 18:52.567
ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO BRING

18:52.633 --> 18:53.500
REAL CHANGE HERE.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.500
AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT

18:54.567 --> 18:56.633
ALREADY, THE STRIKE HAS HAD SOME

18:56.700 --> 18:56.867
EFFECT.

18:56.934 --> 18:58.567
NOT ONLY DID THE STRIKE SPREAD

18:58.633 --> 18:59.633
TO OTHER SPORTS AND OTHER

18:59.700 --> 19:00.467
ATHLETES, BUT THE NBA PLAYERS

19:00.533 --> 19:01.633
NOW HAVE A PROMISE FROM OWNERS

19:01.700 --> 19:02.533
TO CONVERT AS MANY OF THEIR

19:02.600 --> 19:03.367
ARENAS AS POSSIBLE INTO

19:03.433 --> 19:04.734
POLLING PLACES THIS NOVEMBER.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.066
WHICH IS GREAT, ALTHOUGH IT ALSO

19:06.133 --> 19:07.533
BRINGS US TO THE FACT THAT

19:07.600 --> 19:09.233
SIMPLY VOTING THIS NOVEMBER IS

19:09.300 --> 19:10.433
CLEARLY NOT GOING TO BE NEARLY

19:10.500 --> 19:11.900
ENOUGH.

19:11.967 --> 19:13.000
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I OR THE RNC

19:13.066 --> 19:14.500
WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT

19:14.567 --> 19:17.066
JOE BIDEN WILL BE AN AGENT OF

19:17.133 --> 19:19.200
RADICAL CHANGE, THERE IS JUST

19:19.266 --> 19:20.600
NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT.

19:20.667 --> 19:22.200
TO THE EXTENT THAT REAL CHANGE

19:22.266 --> 19:24.100
IS POSSIBLE THROUGH THE BALLOT

19:24.166 --> 19:25.166
BOX THIS YEAR, IT WILL BE IF

19:25.233 --> 19:27.934
BIDEN IS ELECTED ALONGSIDE

19:28.000 --> 19:29.100
PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATES ALL DOWN

19:29.166 --> 19:30.300
THE BALLOT, FROM THE SENATE

19:30.367 --> 19:31.433
TO STATE LEGISLATURES TO CITY

19:31.500 --> 19:33.200
COUNCILS TO SHERIFFS.

19:33.266 --> 19:36.767
AND EVEN THAT WILL BE VERY MUCH

19:36.834 --> 19:38.266
A BEGINNING AND NOT AN END.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.934
NONE OF THIS IS EASY.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.667
BUT IT HAS TO BEGIN, AND NOW.

19:42.734 --> 19:44.000
BECAUSE OUR CURRENT SITUATION IS

19:44.066 --> 19:44.600
COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.000
AND THE RNC THIS WEEK ACTUALLY

19:47.066 --> 19:48.834
ENDED UP BEING A PRETTY GOOD

19:48.900 --> 19:51.333
REMINDER THAT WHERE WE STILL

19:51.400 --> 19:52.367
MIGHT END UP GOING IS GENUINELY

19:52.433 --> 19:53.066
TERRIFYING.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.767
BECAUSE IF IT SHOWED US ONE

19:54.834 --> 19:56.133
THING THIS WEEK, IT'S THE DANGER

19:56.200 --> 19:57.500
IN CONTINUING TO BE GOVERNED

19:57.567 --> 19:59.367
BY AN ADMINISTRATION THAT

19:59.433 --> 20:00.567
ENCOURAGES THE UGLIEST FORCES IN

20:00.633 --> 20:02.400
AMERICAN SOCIETY, THAT LIONIZES

20:02.467 --> 20:03.667
THREATS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST

20:03.734 --> 20:05.100
PEACEFUL PROTEST, THAT TELLS US

20:05.166 --> 20:06.800
THERE IS NO CONFLICT BETWEEN

20:06.867 --> 20:09.266
SUPPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

20:09.333 --> 20:10.667
"OUR AFRICAN-AMERICAN

20:10.734 --> 20:11.767
NEIGHBORS," AND THAT INSISTS

20:11.834 --> 20:12.533
THAT THE "BEST IS YET TO COME,"

20:12.600 --> 20:14.734
WHICH, GIVEN EVERYTHING WE'VE

20:14.800 --> 20:16.166
SEEN IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, IS

20:16.233 --> 20:17.767
SOUNDING LESS LIKE A PROMISE AND

20:17.834 --> 20:19.300
MORE LIKE A FUCKING THREAT.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.300
AND NOW THIS.

20:21.133 --> 20:25.734
>> Announcer: AND NOW...

20:25.800 --> 20:28.133
THE RNC GETS OFF TO A GREAT

20:28.200 --> 20:28.734
START.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.567
>> IN THE STATE OF UTAH, WE

20:30.633 --> 20:32.834
INTRODUCED THE WORLD TO THE

20:32.900 --> 20:33.066
FRISBEE.

20:33.133 --> 20:36.734
>> WE BRING YOU MICROCHIPS.

20:36.800 --> 20:36.967
CHEESES.

20:37.033 --> 20:39.000
AND MICROBREWERIES.

20:39.066 --> 20:42.333
WE ARE ALSO THE STATE OF THE

20:42.400 --> 20:44.567
HOME OF

20:44.633 --> 20:46.367
PRESIDENT CALVIN COOLIDGE.

20:46.433 --> 20:47.000
THANK YOU.

20:47.066 --> 20:48.567
>> THAT FREEDOM IS NOT AVAILABLE

20:48.633 --> 20:51.200
TO YOU IF YOU CAN'T GO TO YOUR

20:51.266 --> 20:52.567
PLACE OF BUSINESS OR DRIVE DOWN

20:52.633 --> 20:55.033
THE STREET WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING

20:55.100 --> 20:56.767
BITTEN -- BEATEN.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.367
MARYLAND IS HOME OF THE

20:58.433 --> 21:00.166
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, AND TOO,

21:00.233 --> 21:03.000
OF OUR GREATEST SEGREGATION --

21:03.066 --> 21:05.000
OF ABOLITIONISTS.

21:05.066 --> 21:07.333
>> MONTANA, AFFECTIONATELY AND

21:07.400 --> 21:10.800
ENTHUSIASTICALLY, GIVES ITS

21:10.867 --> 21:15.967
40 -- 27 VOTES TO THE NEXT --

21:16.033 --> 21:16.633
THE PRESIDENT.

21:16.700 --> 21:20.734
>> I AM THE SON OF ANTHONY AND

21:20.800 --> 21:23.100
JUDY, AND I CAST OHIO'S 82 VOTES

21:23.166 --> 21:25.333
FOR DONALD DRAWN PRESIDENT.

21:25.400 --> 21:28.567
>> TODAY, WE PROUDLY AND HAPPILY

21:28.633 --> 21:30.400
CAST ALL 50 OF OUR VOTES FOR THE

21:30.467 --> 21:36.266
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

21:36.333 --> 21:37.700
JOHN TRUMP.

21:37.767 --> 21:38.133
>> DONALD J. TRUMP.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.300
>> MR. PRESIDENT AND

21:39.367 --> 21:41.433
MR. VICE PRESIDENT, YOU ARE

21:41.500 --> 21:44.033
REHIRED.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.133
>> John: MOVING ON.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.967
FINALLY TONIGHT, A QUICK UPDATE

21:47.033 --> 21:48.066
ABOUT DANBURY, CONNECTICUT.

21:48.133 --> 21:48.633
ALSO KNOWN AS THE HAT CITY,

21:48.700 --> 21:49.500
WHICH IS APPROPRIATE, BECAUSE

21:49.567 --> 21:50.333
MUCH LIKE THE BOWLER HAT,

21:50.400 --> 21:51.500
DANBURY IS A SUPERFLUOUS

21:51.567 --> 21:52.233
ACCESSORY WITH NO PRACTICAL

21:52.300 --> 21:52.967
PURPOSE THAT WENT OUT OF STYLE

21:53.033 --> 21:54.834
IN THE 1930s.

21:54.900 --> 21:57.667
NOW YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED, I'VE

21:57.734 --> 21:59.300
TAKEN A FEW CHEAP SHOTS LIKE

21:59.367 --> 22:00.166
THAT AT THE CITY OF DANBURY OVER

22:00.233 --> 22:00.900
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

22:00.967 --> 22:01.934
AND PERHAPS UNSURPRISINGLY, THE

22:02.000 --> 22:02.667
PEOPLE THERE HAVE TAKEN NOTICE.

22:02.734 --> 22:05.200
>> OLIVER DELIVERED A SCATHING

22:05.266 --> 22:08.266
SIDEBAR SMACKDOWN ABOUT DANBURY.

22:08.333 --> 22:08.900
AND THIS IS THE CLOSEST SNIPPET

22:08.967 --> 22:09.467
THAT WE COULD AIR WITHOUT

22:09.533 --> 22:10.367
GETTING OUR FCC LICENSE PULLED.

22:10.433 --> 22:14.133
WATCH THIS.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.333
>> John: 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING

22:15.400 --> 22:16.367
TO FORGET A TOWN IN CONNECTICUT,

22:16.433 --> 22:17.367
WHY NOT FORGET DANBURY?

22:17.433 --> 22:21.367
BECAUSE, AND THIS IS TRUE,

22:21.433 --> 22:22.166
DANBURY.

22:22.233 --> 22:23.033
I KNOW EXACTLY THREE THINGS

22:23.100 --> 22:24.033
ABOUT DANBURY: "USA TODAY"

22:24.100 --> 22:25.066
RANKED IT THE SECOND-BEST CITY

22:25.133 --> 22:26.967
TO LIVE IN IN 2015, IT WAS ONCE

22:27.033 --> 22:28.233
THE CENTER OF THE AMERICAN HAT

22:28.300 --> 22:29.533
INDUSTRY -- AND IF YOU'RE FROM

22:29.600 --> 22:30.834
THERE, YOU'VE GOT A STANDING

22:30.900 --> 22:31.600
INVITE TO COME GET A THRASHING

22:31.667 --> 22:32.266
FROM JOHN OLIVER.

22:32.333 --> 22:35.166
CHILDREN INCLUDED.

22:35.233 --> 22:36.700
>> YEAH, THERE WAS -- YOU SHOULD

22:36.767 --> 22:40.767
WATCH THE CLIP, THERE'S NOT,

22:40.800 --> 22:42.533
LIKE I SAID, AS -- AS MY

22:42.600 --> 22:43.800
PRODUCER JOHN SAYS, THERE'S NOT

22:43.867 --> 22:44.600
A LOT -- THERE'S A LOT OF BLEEPS

22:44.667 --> 22:45.500
IN THAT ONE.

22:45.567 --> 22:46.433
>> John: OKAY, DID I TELL

22:46.500 --> 22:47.567
DANBURY, A SEEMINGLY CHARMING,

22:47.633 --> 22:48.133
RANDOM CITY IN CONNECTICUT,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.633
TO GO FUCK ITSELF?

22:50.700 --> 22:51.900
YEAH, YEAH, I DID.

22:51.967 --> 22:52.834
DID I INVITE EVERYONE WHO LIVED

22:52.900 --> 22:53.533
THERE TO COME GET A THRASHING

22:53.600 --> 22:54.433
FROM ME?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.467
I CAN'T DENY THAT.

22:55.533 --> 22:56.266
THE ONLY THING HE'S TECHNICALLY

22:56.333 --> 22:56.934
WRONG ABOUT IS WHEN HE SAYS

22:57.000 --> 22:57.834
THERE WERE A LOT OF BLEEPS IN

22:57.900 --> 23:03.767
THAT CLIP.

23:03.834 --> 23:05.200
BECAUSE I ONLY HEARD ONE BLEEP.

23:05.266 --> 23:06.166
THE SECOND TIME I SAID

23:06.233 --> 23:06.967
"FUCK DANBURY" THE AUDIO SEEMED

23:07.033 --> 23:07.734
TO CUT OUT.

23:07.800 --> 23:08.467
AND I'M WILLING TO ASSUME THAT

23:08.533 --> 23:09.600
WAS OUR FAULT.

23:09.667 --> 23:10.433
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER: THIS

23:10.500 --> 23:11.467
NETWORK IS OPERATED BY AT&T.

23:11.533 --> 23:12.633
THAT'S RIGHT, BUSINESS DADDY!

23:12.700 --> 23:13.200
GUESS WHO'S SWINGING AGAIN!

23:13.266 --> 23:16.266
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE

23:16.333 --> 23:16.934
WE'VE SPOKEN, HASN'T IT?

23:17.000 --> 23:17.700
HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU?

23:17.767 --> 23:18.834
ME, I'M JUST SHELTERING IN A

23:18.900 --> 23:19.367
VOID, FIGHTING WITH SOME

23:19.433 --> 23:20.100
ZIP CODES IN CONNECTICUT AND

23:20.166 --> 23:20.934
MAY OR MAY NOT WISH TO

23:21.000 --> 23:22.433
BE MURDERED BY THE COSTAR OF

23:22.500 --> 23:22.834
"MARRIAGE STORY."

23:22.900 --> 23:23.700
IT'S BEEN A WEIRD FEW MONTHS.

23:23.767 --> 23:24.633
WE'VE GOT LOTS TO CATCH UP ON --

23:24.700 --> 23:25.467
WE SHOULD PROBABLY TALK ON THE

23:25.533 --> 23:26.867
PHONE MORE, BUT I DO REALIZE

23:26.934 --> 23:29.834
THAT'S A BIG ASK FOR YOU.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.300
AND LOOK, I DID THINK THE PEOPLE

23:31.367 --> 23:32.333
OF DANBURY WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH

23:32.400 --> 23:34.200
WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING.

23:34.266 --> 23:36.166
I DIDN'T EXPECT THEM TO SIMPLY

23:36.233 --> 23:37.667
SIT THERE AND COWER IN FEAR OF

23:37.734 --> 23:38.567
MY FISTS, PAUL HOLLYWOOD AND

23:38.633 --> 23:40.834
MARY BERRY.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.033
WHAT I DIDN'T EXPECT WAS JUST

23:42.100 --> 23:42.633
HOW GREAT THEIR RESPONSE WOULD

23:42.700 --> 23:43.500
BE.

23:43.567 --> 23:44.967
BECAUSE DANBURY, AS ONE,

23:45.033 --> 23:46.233
HAS RISEN UP AND FOUGHT BACK

23:46.300 --> 23:48.467
MAGNIFICENTLY.

23:48.533 --> 23:49.333
TAKE THIS SURPRISINGLY

23:49.400 --> 23:50.600
WELL-PRODUCED RESPONSE FROM A

23:50.667 --> 23:53.967
CHILD WHO LIVES THERE:

23:54.033 --> 23:57.233
>> SO ACCORDING TO MY MOM, HBO'S

23:57.333 --> 24:01.667
COMEDIAN JOHN OLIVER --

24:01.734 --> 24:03.834
JOHN OLIVER THREW SOME SHADE ON

24:03.900 --> 24:08.767
WHAT DANBURY HAS TO OFFER.

24:08.834 --> 24:12.834
THE THINGS YOU MENTIONED ABOUT

24:12.900 --> 24:15.000
DANBURY ARE SO YESTERDAY, LIKE

24:15.066 --> 24:17.500
AN ARTICLE FROM 2015.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.767
I WAS, LIKE, THREE-YEARS-OLD

24:19.834 --> 24:20.500
WHEN THAT CAME OUT!

24:20.567 --> 24:21.333
THREE!

24:21.400 --> 24:22.834
>> John: WOW!

24:22.900 --> 24:27.834
THAT KID CAME IN HOT!

24:27.900 --> 24:28.867
AND THAT IS ALL GOOD.

24:28.934 --> 24:29.767
THE ONLY THING I OBJECT

24:29.834 --> 24:30.433
TO WAS HIM PUTTING MY NAME

24:30.500 --> 24:31.266
IN AIR QUOTES.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.000
BECAUSE, COME ON, KID!

24:32.066 --> 24:33.266
THIS IS MY ACTUAL NAME!

24:33.333 --> 24:34.400
IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE UP,

24:34.467 --> 24:35.533
I WOULDN'T CHOOSE SOMETHING THAT

24:35.600 --> 24:36.166
MAKES ME SOUND LIKE A DICKENSIAN

24:36.233 --> 24:37.934
CARICATURE.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
I'D PICK SOMETHING INCREDIBLE

24:39.066 --> 24:40.533
LIKE J-SUAVE OR

24:40.600 --> 24:44.734
BIG JOHNNY TWO-SOUPS.

24:44.800 --> 24:45.567
ALSO, FOR THE RECORD, THAT IS

24:45.633 --> 24:46.800
THE FIRST TIME ANYONE'S EVER

24:46.867 --> 24:48.967
LANDED A SUCCESSFUL BURN THAT

24:49.033 --> 24:49.500
STARTED WITH THE PHRASE,

24:49.567 --> 24:51.233
"ACCORDING TO MY MOM."

24:51.300 --> 24:52.967
KUDOS, KID.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.066
BUT THAT BOY WASN'T DANBURY'S

24:54.133 --> 24:54.400
ONLY DEFENDER.

24:54.467 --> 24:55.467
THERE WAS ALSO THIS OFFICIAL

24:55.533 --> 24:56.266
RESPONSE FROM THE DANBURY HAT

24:56.333 --> 24:56.867
TRICKS, THEIR LOCAL PRO HOCKEY

24:56.934 --> 24:57.767
TEAM.

24:57.834 --> 24:59.000
>> JOHN MAKES SEVERAL VALID

24:59.066 --> 25:00.467
POINTS.

25:00.533 --> 25:01.600
OUR RAILWAY MUSEUM IS QUITE

25:01.667 --> 25:02.533
CHARMING, AND WE DO WEAR OUR

25:02.600 --> 25:05.433
"HAT CITY" MONIKER PROUDLY.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.567
HE DID HIS RESEARCH LIKE ANY

25:06.633 --> 25:07.233
INTREPID REPORTER SHOULD, WHICH

25:07.300 --> 25:08.133
HE IS.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.734
THAT IS, WHEN HE'S NOT TAKING

25:09.800 --> 25:11.867
BREAKS TO FILM SUCH CINEMATIC

25:11.934 --> 25:13.667
CLASSICS AS "THE SMURFS,"

25:13.734 --> 25:17.900
"WONDER PARK," OR MY PERSONAL

25:17.967 --> 25:19.600
FAVORITE, AND THIS IS TRUE, HIS

25:19.667 --> 25:20.300
ICONIC ROLE AS DICK PANTS IN THE

25:20.367 --> 25:21.100
"LOVE GURU."

25:21.166 --> 25:22.967
THERE IS ONE AREA, THOUGH, WHERE

25:23.033 --> 25:24.000
JOHN DID NOT DO HIS HOMEWORK,

25:24.066 --> 25:25.200
AND THAT IS, OF COURSE, THE IDEA

25:25.266 --> 25:26.500
THAT HE COULD GIVE ANYONE IN

25:26.567 --> 25:27.767
DANBURY A "THRASHING."

25:27.834 --> 25:29.934
>> John: AGAIN, VERY GOOD.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.467
HONESTLY, DANBURY MIGHT WANT TO

25:31.533 --> 25:32.667
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER CHANGING ITS

25:32.734 --> 25:33.900
NICKNAME FROM "THE HAT CITY," TO

25:33.967 --> 25:35.667
"THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SEEM MORE

25:35.734 --> 25:36.834
THAN CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER MY

25:36.900 --> 25:38.367
JOB" CITY.

25:38.433 --> 25:39.000
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY'D

25:39.066 --> 25:41.734
WANT IT.

25:41.800 --> 25:42.633
YES, WE BOTH LIVE IN SAD, EMPTY

25:42.700 --> 25:43.333
VOIDS WHERE HOPE GOES TO DIE,

25:43.400 --> 25:44.266
BUT AT LEAST DANBURY HAS

25:44.333 --> 25:45.266
A RAILWAY MUSEUM.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.834
WE HAVEN'T HAD ONE OF THOSE

25:46.900 --> 25:48.734
SINCE SEASON FOUR.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.200
BUT THE STRONGEST RESPONSE BY

25:50.266 --> 25:51.333
FAR ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE MAYOR

25:51.400 --> 25:53.934
OF DANBURY HIMSELF.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.667
>> BEHIND ME, YOU'LL SEE THE

25:56.734 --> 25:58.867
CITY OF DANBURY SEWER PLANT, AND

25:58.934 --> 26:00.166
WE ARE GONNA RENAME IT THE

26:00.233 --> 26:00.734
"JOHN OLIVER MEMORIAL SEWER

26:00.800 --> 26:01.333
PLANT."

26:01.400 --> 26:08.166
WHY?

26:08.233 --> 26:10.133
BECAUSE IT'S FULL OF

26:10.200 --> 26:10.900
JUST LIKE YOU, JOHN.

26:10.967 --> 26:11.767
>> John:EXCELLENT.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.200
SIMPLY EXCELLENT.

26:13.266 --> 26:14.467
JUST CALLING IT THE "JOHN OLIVER

26:14.533 --> 26:15.333
SEWER PLANT" WOULD HAVE

26:15.400 --> 26:16.567
COMFORTABLY BEEN ENOUGH.

26:16.633 --> 26:17.300
THEY WENT A STEP FARTHER AND

26:17.367 --> 26:18.767
WENT WITH THE "JOHN OLIVER

26:18.834 --> 26:19.633
"MEMORIAL" SEWER PLANT," WHICH

26:19.700 --> 26:20.567
IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE,

26:20.633 --> 26:21.967
BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM THAT I'VE

26:22.033 --> 26:23.033
JUST BEEN MURDERED BY THE CITY

26:23.100 --> 26:24.467
OF DANBURY.

26:24.533 --> 26:25.400
AND I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT

26:25.467 --> 26:26.400
THIS, NOT JUST BECAUSE THAT'S

26:26.467 --> 26:27.567
A SUPERB JOKE, BUT BECAUSE I

26:27.633 --> 26:28.967
KNOW JUST HOW VALUABLE THAT

26:29.066 --> 26:31.967
POOP FACTORY IS TO DANBURY.

26:32.033 --> 26:34.967
WE DUG INTO THEIR 2019-2020

26:35.033 --> 26:36.000
ADOPTED BUDGET AND FOUND THAT

26:36.066 --> 26:36.834
DANBURY'S SEWER SYSTEM WAS BY

26:36.900 --> 26:37.700
FAR THE MOST EXPENSIVE PUBLIC

26:37.767 --> 26:38.533
UTILITY PROJECT FOR THAT

26:38.600 --> 26:40.133
FISCAL YEAR.

26:40.200 --> 26:42.533
THEY SPENT $103 MILLION DOLLARS

26:42.600 --> 26:46.133
UPGRADING IT, MORE THAN 20 TIMES

26:46.200 --> 26:47.400
THEIR NEXT BUDGET ITEM.

26:47.467 --> 26:48.166
AND NORMALLY, I'D MAKE SOME EASY

26:48.233 --> 26:49.233
JOKE ABOUT DANBURY BEING A TOWN

26:49.300 --> 26:50.367
SO BACKED UP WITH SHIT THAT IT

26:50.433 --> 26:52.467
HAD TO SPEND NINE FIGURES ON

26:52.533 --> 26:54.033
FIXING THEIR SEWAGE SYSTEM, BUT

26:54.100 --> 26:55.734
THE TRUTH IS, MY OPINION OF THE

26:55.800 --> 26:57.233
CITY HAS NOW CHANGED.

26:57.300 --> 26:58.667
PREVIOUSLY, I'D HAVE SEEN THIS

26:58.734 --> 27:00.867
IMAGE OF A MINK ABOUT TO DIVE

27:00.934 --> 27:02.166
INTO CANDLEWOOD LAKE, AND

27:02.233 --> 27:02.800
ASSUMED IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLY

27:02.867 --> 27:04.133
TRYING TO DROWN ITSELF BECAUSE

27:04.200 --> 27:09.633
OF ITS PROXIMITY TO DANBURY.

27:09.700 --> 27:11.700
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT'S SIMPLY

27:11.767 --> 27:11.900
WRONG.

27:11.967 --> 27:12.600
THAT MINK'S PROBABLY GOT A

27:12.667 --> 27:13.633
DECENT YOUTUBE SHOW --

27:13.700 --> 27:14.567
EVERYONE IN DANBURY SEEMS TO.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.600
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE PLACE.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.500
AND THE TRUTH IS, THINGS HAVE

27:16.567 --> 27:18.233
BEEN SO BLEAK RECENTLY, I NEEDED

27:18.300 --> 27:19.266
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.200
SOMETHING TO RESTORE MY FAITH

27:20.266 --> 27:25.333
IN HUMAN NATURE.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.233
AND THAT IS WHY I WAS SO

27:26.300 --> 27:27.533
INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED TO

27:27.600 --> 27:28.266
THEN SEE THIS.

27:28.333 --> 27:29.967
>> OUR VIDEO IS IN JEST.

27:30.033 --> 27:31.533
WE'RE NOT REALLY GONNA NAME THE

27:31.600 --> 27:33.133
SEWER PLANT AFTER JOHN OLIVER.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.433
HOWEVER, HE STILL IS FULL OF

27:35.500 --> 27:38.500
, SO I'LL STICK BY THAT.

27:38.567 --> 27:39.500
>> John: WAIT, SO YOU'RE NOT

27:39.567 --> 27:40.567
DOING IT?

27:40.633 --> 27:41.533
OH, FUCK YOU, DANBURY!

27:41.600 --> 27:42.467
YOU HAD THE FIRST GOOD IDEA

27:42.533 --> 27:44.600
IN YOUR CITY'S HISTORY AND

27:44.667 --> 27:45.400

27:45.500 --> 27:46.734
FOLLOW THROUGH?

WHAT A CLASSIC DANBURY MOVE.

27:48.567 --> 27:48.734

27:48.800 --> 27:50.433
I DIDN'T KNOW I WANTED MY NAME

27:50.500 --> 27:51.400
ON YOUR SHIT FACTORY, BUT NOW

27:51.467 --> 27:55.500
