00:06.000 --> 00:08.920
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.800 --> 00:14.640
Guard!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.080
Your new cellmate.

00:56.800 --> 00:57.840
What are you in for?

01:12.960 --> 01:17.480
2 DAYS EARLIER

01:27.440 --> 01:28.280
You kidding?

01:28.360 --> 01:30.640
I wouldn't have called otherwise.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.600
Impossible. Check again.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.240
I checked it all night!

01:37.480 --> 01:38.760
Original clasp.

01:38.840 --> 01:41.520
Original setting.
No marks on the gemstones.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.600
I guarantee you
this necklace has never been taken apart.

01:45.160 --> 01:46.120
If so,

01:46.200 --> 01:49.200
the story about the scattered gemstones
is bullshit.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.960
The necklace never left
the Pellegrinis' safe?

01:52.440 --> 01:54.160
-Why would they lie?
-No idea.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.480
Maybe they lied about everything else,

01:56.560 --> 01:58.880
including my father's theft.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.640
For 25 years,
I've believed my dad to be a thief.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.800
-I've been wrong for 25 years.
-Easy, Assane.

02:06.480 --> 02:08.280
You have the necklace. You made it out.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.880
-Who cares about the rest?
-Who cares about truth?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.920
No, I'm not saying that, but…

02:15.040 --> 02:16.960
You told me
you'd stop after this necklace,

02:17.440 --> 02:19.120
that Raoul needed his dad.

02:20.080 --> 02:22.240
-Think of him.
-That's all I'm doing.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.520
He should know who his grandpa was.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.720
Take them out.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.120
-Assane.
-I know what I'm doing.

02:34.640 --> 02:35.960
What are you doing?

02:37.720 --> 02:38.800
Nothing special.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.320
-Hiding something?
-Me?

02:48.440 --> 02:49.400
Not at all.

02:50.200 --> 02:52.440
-He doesn't believe me!
-Kids…

03:07.360 --> 03:08.440
Police! Open up!

03:13.080 --> 03:14.680
Lt. Dumont! Open up!

03:24.680 --> 03:26.080
Don't make me break it down.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.080
Sit down.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.520
-How old are you?
-Sixteen.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.680
-You live alone?
-I live with my mother.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.760
-She'll be back.
-Really?

03:58.120 --> 03:59.240
Let's wait for her.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.520
Pack your things.
We're going to Social Services.

04:17.640 --> 04:18.640
Did you hear?

04:19.840 --> 04:21.800
Come on! Hurry up!

05:08.080 --> 05:09.320
What's the holdup?

05:37.320 --> 05:39.680
Work on your escape technique, sonny!

05:51.000 --> 05:52.920
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.280
Just passing through.
I'm off to the foundation.

05:56.360 --> 05:58.320
I heard about your father's necklace.

05:59.080 --> 06:00.400
They recovered a copy.

06:01.440 --> 06:03.040
Probably driving him crazy.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.480
You seem heartbroken about it.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.640
Don't worry. The police have a lead.

06:09.720 --> 06:12.280
Says the media,
but since he owns most of it,

06:12.360 --> 06:13.400
I have my doubts.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.560
The necklace vanished again
after 25 years. Bad luck.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.560
Back luck, indeed.

06:19.640 --> 06:22.360
It really upset him at the time.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.040
It could be even worse now.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.160
How are you?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.480
Slowly but surely fading away

06:29.040 --> 06:30.960
in this gilded cage your father gave me.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.600
He did pick out the orchids.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.880
-Steered clear of chrysanthemums.
-Stop it.

06:37.360 --> 06:39.960
-He doesn't hate you.
-No, he's afraid of me.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.800
I know where the bodies are.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.880
Watch out for yourself.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.560
He adores you, you adore him, but…

06:46.640 --> 06:47.760
he says it himself,

06:48.680 --> 06:50.520
you're with him or against him.

06:52.560 --> 06:53.400
Goodbye, Mom.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.280
Goodbye, Juliette.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.800
Goodbye, François.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.280
Ms. Pellegrini?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.160
For you.

07:06.240 --> 07:07.720
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

07:10.720 --> 07:15.400
LUXEMBOURG GARDENS, 14:00
NO POLICE

07:28.240 --> 07:29.680
-Bye.
-Bye. Thank you.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.800
Medium rare, no onions.

07:37.880 --> 07:39.160
There. Thank you.

07:39.880 --> 07:41.360
Yes, madam? That's right.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.960
Medium rare, no onions.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
Thank you.

08:20.240 --> 08:22.000
You're in a hurry. Good, so am I.

08:23.360 --> 08:24.320
How much do you want?

08:25.440 --> 08:26.600
My price is zero.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.360
I don't want money.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.160
I want answers.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.680
I can't see his face. I can't hear!

08:35.760 --> 08:36.920
His hand is over the mic.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.680
Fix it, goddamn it!

08:38.760 --> 08:40.720
Fix it! I want to hear them!

08:40.800 --> 08:43.840
All units, the Louvre thief is there!

08:43.920 --> 08:46.720
Don't intervene until he makes a move.
Got it?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.440
I said no police, Juliette.

08:49.240 --> 08:52.520
-You stole the necklace from us?
-I'm asking the questions.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.280
Why did you lie?

08:55.040 --> 08:57.040
-Lie? About what?
-The necklace.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.400
It wasn't taken apart.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.040
That means my father never stole it.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.040
That's true.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.960
I mean, it wasn't taken apart.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.840
My father and I got this idea
of the scattered gemstones

09:12.920 --> 09:15.120
to build up the buzz before the sale.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.200
Daddy bought it back
from a jeweler in South Africa.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.760
-That doesn't hold up.
-I swear.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.160
-Look at me. You know me.
-Stop it.

09:25.240 --> 09:27.840
Shit, they know each other. Look at that.

09:28.480 --> 09:31.720
I'm sure they do!
Pellegrini is playing us.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.200
Belkacem, I want to hear! Get closer!

09:35.200 --> 09:37.000
Get between them and the exit.

09:37.080 --> 09:40.000
If my father finds out, you're a dead man.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.280
Give me back the necklace.
I'll tell the cops I don't know you.

09:43.360 --> 09:45.080
Tell me my father was innocent.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.960
I would love to tell you that,

09:47.040 --> 09:49.080
but he was guilty and signed a confession.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.360
I think you don't know your father.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.480
OK! He's on the move! All units!

10:07.560 --> 10:09.120
Bring him in!

10:10.120 --> 10:11.200
Stop!

10:12.480 --> 10:13.400
Stop!

10:13.480 --> 10:14.560
Get him!

10:14.640 --> 10:16.800
He left on a bike. Get him!

10:27.680 --> 10:30.120
-We can't let him get away!
-We're on him.

10:30.200 --> 10:31.640
Gotta get him this time!

10:37.240 --> 10:38.840
He's headed for Vavin.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.080
Catch him at the exit.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.280
What's this?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.600
How did he manage that?

10:53.680 --> 10:55.000
Guys, headed for the Senate!

10:56.560 --> 10:58.040
I can't believe it! Shit!

10:59.040 --> 11:00.920
He's headed for the observatory.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.960
Exit six, let's go! Everyone go!

11:09.440 --> 11:10.880
Stop!

11:11.920 --> 11:14.040
-On the ground!
-Come here, dammit!

11:14.120 --> 11:17.040
-Give me everything!
-Your hands.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.080
It's not him.

11:18.640 --> 11:20.680
Burger, medium rare, no onions?

11:20.760 --> 11:23.160
-It's not him!
-Don't move!

11:25.320 --> 11:27.360
Shit, dammit!

11:27.440 --> 11:28.800
Take off your mask!

11:29.800 --> 11:32.000
-Show your face.
-Lock the park.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.360
No one gets out, OK?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.280
It's impossible! Where is he?

11:36.760 --> 11:37.600
Shit!

12:26.200 --> 12:30.240
FOR ASSANE

12:33.720 --> 12:35.600
My son, I am ashamed.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.280
I am guilty of what I am accused of.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.920
I wanted to give you a better life.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
I failed.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.880
So I hope you will forgive me.

12:45.600 --> 12:46.880
Remember,

12:46.960 --> 12:50.040
the truth will always lie in "libraryes."

12:50.680 --> 12:52.800
Don't "comet" the same mistakes I did.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.400
I love you.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.240
Dad.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.040
De Gaulle with one L?

13:00.120 --> 13:03.200
Be careful, Assane.
Spelling is everything.

13:03.280 --> 13:05.200
If your mother could see you!

13:28.800 --> 13:31.360
MINISTRY OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS

13:31.440 --> 13:33.880
KILLED HIMSELF IN HIS CELL

13:47.000 --> 13:50.040
-I always make spelling mistakes.
-You and I both.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.480
My father, never. Let alone two in a row.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.920
-Yeah? So?
-Look.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.560
-"Comet," "libraryes."
-Yes.

13:59.640 --> 14:01.160
-And?
-I looked around.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.640
There was a guy in prison with my dad.
Called Étienne Comet.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.320
C-O-M-E-T.

14:08.320 --> 14:09.560
Where did he work?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.800
-The library.
-Exactly.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.000
Hang on, Assane…

14:15.640 --> 14:17.760
That's called a coincidence.

14:19.200 --> 14:22.400
-Seriously?
-A hidden message in spelling mistakes?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.280
-You're reaching.
-You don't understand.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.960
It's been under my nose for years.
Trying to prove his innocence.

14:32.560 --> 14:33.640
Thanks to this Comet.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.200
And I did nothing.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.120
You're right.

14:42.280 --> 14:45.240
You have doubts.
See this to the end. Go see Comet.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.640
-Where is he?
-In prison.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.080
-Make a visit request.
-He's sick. He doesn't leave his cell.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.400
-Well…
-I'll find another way.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.760
-No!
-Yes.

14:58.840 --> 15:01.800
-No!
-You said, "See this to the end."

15:03.160 --> 15:04.160
I must see Comet.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.280
Fucking hell! Shit! Assane!

15:08.840 --> 15:09.680
Wait!

15:10.400 --> 15:11.240
Wait!

15:14.040 --> 15:14.880
Wait!

15:31.600 --> 15:32.920
Visitor. Djibril Traoré.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.320
Hey, Cousin.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.040
Have a seat.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.080
You and I are cousins?

15:47.720 --> 15:48.920
I don't have any.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.480
Well, now you have one.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.360
Your cousin has a present for you.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.240
You… get out.

16:00.520 --> 16:01.680
I go inside instead.

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
Hang on.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.400
Are you totally stupid?

16:13.200 --> 16:15.560
Oh, I know! Actually…

16:15.640 --> 16:18.080
The guards won't notice anything

16:18.160 --> 16:22.360
because you and I totally look like twins.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.160
There.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.360
The guards just switched.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.720
And the other inmates?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.920
You've been quarantined for a week.

16:43.880 --> 16:46.480
Tonight, you're being moved to a cell.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.280
Nobody knows you in prison.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.680
OK, but aren't you forgetting something?

16:56.400 --> 16:58.520
Shit, the handcuffs.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.600
Shit, the handcuffs.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.240
I'm so stupid.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.040
How did I not think of that?

17:12.320 --> 17:14.840
-Know the handcuff trick?
-The what?

17:16.520 --> 17:17.720
Now you know it.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.200
Guard! We're done.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.560
I know why you're here.
Deal so much as a joint, I'll find you.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.120
I got you out. I can get you back in.

17:34.080 --> 17:36.040
-See you, Cousin.
-Go ahead.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.280
Guard.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.440
Give Auntie a kiss for me!

17:52.520 --> 17:53.360
Guard.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.880
I know it's hard here at first.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.440
You'll get used to it.

18:42.520 --> 18:44.520
We respect all individual faiths here.

18:46.880 --> 18:49.400
Personally,
one book often brought me…

18:50.160 --> 18:51.520
answers…

18:52.840 --> 18:53.840
and comfort.

18:59.480 --> 19:00.520
Welcome, my boy.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.480
THE HOLY BIBLE

19:09.880 --> 19:12.920
Ms. Pellegrini, one thing is bothering me.

19:14.080 --> 19:17.680
Based on the video, you and the suspect…

19:19.240 --> 19:20.560
seemed to know each other.

19:22.280 --> 19:26.120
Lieutenant, it sounds like
you're treating me as a suspect.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.760
-Am I accused of anything?
-No, not at all.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.720
If that's the case, no problem.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.600
You can detain me.
I'll send for my lawyers.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.880
You'll get fired within 15 minutes. OK?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.560
-No. hang on--
-Change your tone.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.760
And focus on your investigation.

19:43.440 --> 19:46.760
I'm asking you
what you two said to each other. OK?

19:47.840 --> 19:48.680
Absolutely.

19:51.240 --> 19:52.360
I told him that…

19:53.680 --> 19:56.080
the officer in charge is a moron

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
who got me a plastic necklace.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.240
No more notes?

20:05.720 --> 20:07.320
Find our necklace, Captain.

20:09.640 --> 20:12.280
You don't want to disappoint
your superiors, do you?

20:13.360 --> 20:15.080
-No, madam.
-Very good.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.440
Thank you.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.480
I made coffee if you'd like some.

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
Thanks a lot.

21:21.920 --> 21:22.760
Hey.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.360
Know a guy named Comet?

21:27.520 --> 21:28.480
Étienne Comet.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.800
-What do you want with him?
-Nothing.

21:31.880 --> 21:33.280
Just a mutual friend.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.520
Who is your friend?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.920
I'm quitting. Not good for breathing.

21:43.840 --> 21:44.800
You interested?

21:50.320 --> 21:51.520
Cell 241.

21:56.120 --> 21:57.920
I want to know everything about him.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.800
Vincent Morville, tell me about the theft.

22:36.240 --> 22:39.080
His name was Luis Perenna.
Never seen him before.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.800
-241, Comet. Leroy.
-Yeah.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.080
-Guard?
-Yes, coming.

22:57.160 --> 22:59.240
-Where's Étienne?
-At the infirmary.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.680
-When is he back?
-I don't think he's coming back.

23:03.320 --> 23:04.320
OK, thank you.

23:17.680 --> 23:19.080
Hey, who are you?

23:20.560 --> 23:23.360
-Who are you?
-Djibril. Djibril Traoré.

23:25.720 --> 23:27.440
He owes me 1,000 euros worth of dope.

23:27.520 --> 23:30.160
-Now you owe me. You've got three days.
-Three?

23:30.240 --> 23:32.000
Is it too much time, Djibril?

23:34.520 --> 23:35.360
No, it's fine.

23:35.840 --> 23:36.920
-Yeah.
-It's fine.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.720
-What's going on here?
-Nothing.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.760
-He just got here. Already sick.
-It's all right. I'll take care of it.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.120
Have a seat.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.440
So, what's the matter?

24:14.600 --> 24:16.560
It started with pain all over.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.040
Thought I was pregnant.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.240
But that's not it.

24:22.040 --> 24:23.360
Probably not!

24:23.440 --> 24:24.840
I figured…

24:25.680 --> 24:28.160
a night in the infirmary. For observation.

24:28.920 --> 24:30.160
It'd be wiser, right?

24:32.400 --> 24:33.240
Listen…

24:34.040 --> 24:35.240
I know it's hard at first.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.040
But a big boy like you
will get used to it. Right?

24:42.200 --> 24:43.200
And my night here?

24:44.400 --> 24:45.840
You'll have to do better.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.360
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.040
Got a minute?

24:52.120 --> 24:54.360
-No, I'm going to see the boss.
-Please, a minute.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.400
I need to show you something incredible.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.440
Look.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.160
Paul Sernine.

25:04.880 --> 25:05.720
Luis Perenna.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.320
-What are you doing?
-Don't you see?

25:12.640 --> 25:13.960
They are both anagrams.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.320
-And?
-It makes sense.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.080
A link between the thief
and Arsène Lupin.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.000
We should study this.
Do I talk to Laugier?

25:25.280 --> 25:26.920
Yeah, sure. Great idea.

25:27.560 --> 25:30.800
If you want to look like an idiot.
He's in a good mood.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.520
Seriously, what's this?

25:32.600 --> 25:34.800
What's next? D'Artagnan?
Three Little Pigs?

25:34.880 --> 25:36.920
Get back to work. Let's make progress.

25:38.080 --> 25:40.680
Can't we do better than this?

25:41.160 --> 25:44.160
We're the police. The guy puts on
a costume, and we're done!

25:44.720 --> 25:46.880
What's this mess? He is playing us!

25:47.400 --> 25:49.560
We're nowhere. We suck!

25:49.640 --> 25:51.440
The investigation is bullshit!

26:06.520 --> 26:08.120
-Tell me.
-What do you want?

26:09.680 --> 26:13.040
-How were you getting the dope?
-Why the hell do you care?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.040
Just curious.

26:15.120 --> 26:16.920
You stupid? He swallowed it.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.720
-Then out of his ass.
-There you go.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.640
That's where you're gonna put your cash.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.520
Does he have a death wish?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.640
There you go.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.000
I suppose you did this to yourself?

26:45.080 --> 26:47.800
Right. A stupid accident.
I was shaving, and…

26:48.520 --> 26:49.520
I slipped.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.560
All right. I'll keep you in overnight.

27:02.000 --> 27:02.840
Finally!

27:04.520 --> 27:06.800
Make some friends.
It's useful in here.

27:12.120 --> 27:12.960
Good night.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.320
Étienne?

27:33.960 --> 27:34.800
Étienne?

27:36.720 --> 27:37.560
Étienne.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.040
My name is Assane Diop.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.920
My father was named Babakar Diop.

27:45.520 --> 27:46.800
You were in prison together.

27:54.360 --> 27:55.400
Étienne?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.480
-Babakar.
-Yeah!

27:59.160 --> 28:00.160
Do you remember?

28:01.760 --> 28:02.880
Yeah, maybe, yeah.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.560
-He stole a necklace, right?
-Yes. Well, no.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.360
That's why I'm here.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.920
He was wrongly convicted.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.240
I don't know your father.

28:20.000 --> 28:20.840
No.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.640
-That's impossible.
-Yes.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.080
What do you mean?

28:26.600 --> 28:28.200
He was alone in his cell.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.600
Always under surveillance.

28:32.480 --> 28:34.320
I only saw him once, because…

28:35.160 --> 28:36.880
I brought him a book…

28:37.720 --> 28:39.720
when I was working at the library.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.400
That's all.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.960
There has to be something else.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
Please, try.

28:47.920 --> 28:48.760
Étienne.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.760
When he returned the book, he said…

28:53.840 --> 28:54.720
Yeah?

28:55.520 --> 28:58.040
…that if someone came
on his behalf someday,

29:00.080 --> 29:01.480
he wanted me to give it to him.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.040
He said all the answers were inside.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.040
You still have this book?

29:11.400 --> 29:12.360
Maybe, yeah.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.760
Look through my stuff.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.040
You're not playing?

29:51.920 --> 29:54.080
Came this morning. From your father.

29:55.360 --> 29:57.280
The guards found it in his cell.

30:10.280 --> 30:12.560
Have you heard of the Andrésy school?

30:13.560 --> 30:15.840
One of the best private schools in France.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.200
Someone wants you to attend next year.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.160
A generous donor has paid for everything.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.280
Assane.

30:29.240 --> 30:31.040
You'll get a real education there.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.160
You'll become somebody.

30:36.000 --> 30:39.200
This is your chance. Seize it.
Nothing is written in stone.

30:41.120 --> 30:42.360
I'm glad you like it.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.200
My son, I am ashamed.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.520
I am guilty of what I am accused of.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.640
I wanted to give you a better life.
I failed.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.280
-241?
-Yes.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.200
Shit, clean sheets. It's the Ritz!

31:25.280 --> 31:27.200
-Where are Étienne's things?
-Second shelf.

31:49.360 --> 31:50.520
Good luck.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.720
THE EXPLOITS OF ARSÈNE LUPIN

32:05.000 --> 32:06.320
How was science class?

32:10.320 --> 32:11.640
Raoul, I'm talking to you.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.520
Your science test, did it go OK?

32:19.400 --> 32:20.880
Is that the book Dad gave you?

32:25.320 --> 32:26.920
He scribbled on every page.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.240
You prefer reading to video games now?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.440
How about that?

32:51.160 --> 32:52.080
"Am…"

32:57.760 --> 32:58.880
"Innocent…"

33:07.360 --> 33:09.040
TRAP

33:46.560 --> 33:48.120
"I am innocent,

33:48.200 --> 33:49.960
trapped by Anne…

33:51.080 --> 33:52.000
Pellegrini."

34:19.880 --> 34:21.400
Bogdan hopes you enjoy your meal.

34:22.480 --> 34:24.040
He'll tuck you in tonight.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.480
What the hell is this?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.600
That's it. Restaurant is closed.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.720
It's a weird question,

34:36.800 --> 34:37.680
but I…

34:40.080 --> 34:42.680
I need to know if…

34:43.720 --> 34:44.560
Well…

34:46.720 --> 34:49.400
Was it really Babakar
who stole the necklace 25 years ago?

34:49.480 --> 34:50.320
What?

34:51.760 --> 34:54.880
A necklace worth millions was stolen

34:54.960 --> 34:57.560
and funding for the foundation
is in trouble.

34:57.640 --> 35:01.560
And you piss me off with an old story?
Of course he stole the necklace from us!

35:07.040 --> 35:09.440
Forgive me. I'm sorry, darling.

35:09.520 --> 35:11.680
No, it's my fault.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.280
I keep taking hits.
Everyone wants my head.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.040
Coming from you…

35:18.520 --> 35:20.480
Your father can fend for himself.

35:27.480 --> 35:28.560
You're with me.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.240
You're with me?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.400
Yes.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.560
Stop slacking, come on!

35:56.280 --> 35:57.200
There he is.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.360
Come on. Let's do this.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.640
Here!

36:26.200 --> 36:27.080
Tonight.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.960
You're in love with me.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.800
How is he?

36:46.760 --> 36:47.760
Can I see him?

36:50.840 --> 36:51.680
Thank you.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.760
How's it going, man?

37:03.640 --> 37:04.880
I think she digs you.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.360
You found the book?

37:12.800 --> 37:13.640
Cool.

37:17.920 --> 37:19.360
Can I ask you something?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.080
Anything.

37:23.480 --> 37:24.960
Don't care how you do it,

37:26.080 --> 37:27.440
but make my wife smile.

37:30.080 --> 37:31.680
I won't be able to anymore.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.160
Promise.

37:39.280 --> 37:40.120
OK.

37:42.840 --> 37:44.160
Thanks for the book.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.920
I got what I needed.
I need to avenge my father.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.520
It was a pleasure meeting you.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.360
Hang in there, Djibril.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.040
Thank you.

38:39.520 --> 38:40.440
Good night.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.640
ARSÈNE LUPIN IS IN PRISON

39:03.200 --> 39:04.080
Raoul.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.480
Put down your book.
Turn off the light now, please.

39:11.400 --> 39:12.240
Come on.

39:16.120 --> 39:16.960
Good night.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.480
Let's go.

39:55.600 --> 39:58.320
If you find a clue in Harry Potter…
call us.

40:01.080 --> 40:03.280
-See you tomorrow.
-Give me a lift?

40:03.360 --> 40:04.600
-With pleasure.
-Cool.

40:05.560 --> 40:06.560
See you tomorrow.

40:23.280 --> 40:26.800
DECEASED

40:36.240 --> 40:38.120
No!

40:39.320 --> 40:42.360
Help! Guard!

41:02.840 --> 41:03.960
So, all good? Done?

41:05.080 --> 41:07.880
-No trouble?
-No, on the contrary.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.080
It was too easy.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.480
The bastard wasn't in his cell.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.920
Don't know how he did it.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.600
I found him in the showers.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.200
He'd hanged himself.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.680
"Illusion is probably the most subtle
of all the arts."

41:53.360 --> 41:55.160
"It requires some finesse."

42:07.360 --> 42:09.560
"Sometimes, a fair amount of courage…"

42:20.720 --> 42:22.920
"Eventually, the means do not matter."

42:23.480 --> 42:25.280
"For only the outcome matters."

42:32.160 --> 42:34.960
-Given his condition, no need for it.
-Yeah.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.080
"And, of course,

42:36.760 --> 42:38.560
the thrill of tricking everyone."

42:39.400 --> 42:42.080
THE ESCAPE OF ARSÈNE LUPIN

43:28.680 --> 43:29.520
Hello, sir.

43:37.760 --> 43:38.760
Excuse me.

43:58.000 --> 43:58.840
Assane.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.480
Assane!

44:01.560 --> 44:03.600
I know you framed my father 25 years ago.

44:07.440 --> 44:08.800
What did you do to him?

44:10.760 --> 44:11.600
Assane…

44:12.680 --> 44:14.040
What did you do to him?

44:21.120 --> 44:22.840
Made him sign the confession.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.560
-But I am innocent!
-Innocent or not, that is not the issue.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.640
-Of course it is!
-Trust me.

44:32.720 --> 44:35.080
Better guilty and free
than innocent in jail.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.840
So sign. Think of your son.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.880
For Assane.

44:48.600 --> 44:51.320
It was supposed to earn him
a reduced sentence.

44:53.200 --> 44:56.560
I was told the judge
would be receptive to your situation.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.520
A Senegalese immigrant
raising his son alone in France.

45:01.760 --> 45:03.680
But the judge was so strict.

45:05.720 --> 45:08.480
Your father didn't accept it.
He hanged himself.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.280
That confession was his doom.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.160
I was naive.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.520
There were arrangements.

45:17.600 --> 45:19.920
Arrangements are only good
for people like you.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.040
Never people like my father.

45:23.200 --> 45:25.280
After his death, I helped you.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.240
I helped you.

45:27.560 --> 45:28.600
From a distance.

45:30.520 --> 45:32.000
From a distance, but I helped.

45:35.080 --> 45:36.160
It was you?

45:38.240 --> 45:39.760
The generous donor?

45:40.680 --> 45:41.520
It was you?

45:46.440 --> 45:48.920
I felt responsible for your situation.

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
I wanted to earn your forgiveness.

45:53.720 --> 45:55.800
-Your father…
-Good old Babakar!

45:56.400 --> 46:00.680
You accuse him, drive him to suicide,
and then you ease your conscience!

46:00.760 --> 46:01.800
I didn't accuse him!

46:03.880 --> 46:06.360
A police officer swore that he'd help him!

46:06.440 --> 46:09.000
-That's all! He lied.
-Which police officer?

46:11.000 --> 46:12.240
Which police officer?

46:12.720 --> 46:14.680
-It was so long ago--
-No!

46:15.280 --> 46:16.400
Which police officer?

46:18.160 --> 46:19.000
His name.

46:24.920 --> 46:27.240
-Dumont. His name was Dumont.
-Guard.

46:27.320 --> 46:28.440
Lt. Dumont.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.160
Dumont used my father's trust in you
to frame him.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.600
-Why did he do that?
-I don't know.

46:40.560 --> 46:42.160
I searched for a long time.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.480
Assane.

46:47.120 --> 46:47.960
I swear.

47:06.520 --> 47:08.760
-Where are you going?
-He's lost.

47:08.840 --> 47:10.760
That's not a bad costume!

47:10.840 --> 47:13.360
-Turn around.
-I got it. I know. He took the wrong exit.

47:13.440 --> 47:15.880
-Service exit is that way!
-Gentlemen, be polite.

47:15.960 --> 47:18.560
I'll tell the principal
how you treat new students.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.320
Excuse them. They were born rich,
but with shit for brains.

47:25.280 --> 47:26.200
Benjamin Ferel.

47:27.480 --> 47:29.320
-Assane Diop.
-Nice to meet you.

49:06.680 --> 49:08.120
Can I ask you something?

49:10.040 --> 49:11.520
Don't care how you do it,

49:12.720 --> 49:14.160
but make my wife smile.

49:39.520 --> 49:43.120
LT. GABRIEL DUMONT
