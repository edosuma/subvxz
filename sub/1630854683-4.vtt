WEBVTT

00:04.305 --> 00:06.704
We all drop down
and turn to the camera.

00:06.741 --> 00:08.840
- Why are we doing this?
- Because dad's bored.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.175
Andrew:
I'm not bored.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.344
This is family bonding time.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.812
Okay. You are a little bored,
but let's do this.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.447
Everyone's doing it.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.450
Like, a million years ago.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.552
Yeah. Dad, by the time old
people see stuff like this

00:20.554 --> 00:21.653
Online, it's already dead.

00:21.655 --> 00:22.988
We're not that old.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.523
You knew every word
to that old musical

00:24.525 --> 00:25.790
You made us watch yesterday.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.459
8 mile?

00:27.594 --> 00:30.262
When you hear "lose yourself",
you have to lose yourself.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.697
- So ancient.
- (chuckling)

00:32.767 --> 00:34.666
She's got you there, babe.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.068
Oh, you, too, mom.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.469
You still talk about
mcdonald's pizza.

00:37.505 --> 00:40.004
It was so good.
You'll never understand.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.808
It's embarrassing when your
generation does stuff like this.

00:42.877 --> 00:45.110
How dare you?
Okay. Hit "record."

00:45.179 --> 00:46.879
We're doing this.

00:46.881 --> 00:48.947
All right. To your places.

00:49.016 --> 00:50.982
Okay. We're all doing a chore.

00:51.052 --> 00:53.518
One, two, three.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.757
- Oh-ho-ho!
- Oh, my god.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.492
- (shouting)
- I got a cramp.

01:00.528 --> 01:02.894
- (shouting continues)
cramps, cramps, cramps!

01:02.963 --> 01:05.497
- Okay.
- Hold on. Hold on!

01:05.533 --> 01:07.633
- Don't post this!
- Dad, you're live-streaming.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.568
- Oh, it's right in there!
- (shouting)

01:10.604 --> 01:15.039
Ooh! You don't have
a lacrosse ball?

01:15.076 --> 01:16.908
Buckets.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.577
Waterfalls.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.381
Steph curry with the pop, boi.

01:22.516 --> 01:25.683
Denzel from he got game!

01:25.719 --> 01:28.853
Oh-ho-ho!

01:28.889 --> 01:32.991
So, the sign outside says,
"99-cent hamburgers today."

01:33.060 --> 01:34.927
But the scam is
you can get those every day.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.328
Mmm.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.196
- So, how's the job search?
- Not good.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.332
I started doing
food delivery for super eats.

01:40.467 --> 01:42.066
I'm pretty sure
my employment gap is a thing,

01:42.103 --> 01:43.936
But nobody's saying it.

01:43.938 --> 01:46.070
- Oh.
- Whoa.

Dr. Dela cruz?

01:58.018 --> 02:00.419
Ferdinand.
When did you get back?

02:00.554 --> 02:03.021
Got to swing home for
tax reasons every six months.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.423
You know how it is.

02:04.425 --> 02:06.358
Plus I needed to
let this baby breathe.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.828
Yeah. About that, does manila
not have speed limits?

02:09.963 --> 02:12.564
Sometimes life makes you
move fast.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.766
By the way, did you receive
my new healing bands?

02:14.835 --> 02:16.034
I sent one to
everyone on the block.

02:16.103 --> 02:18.370
Good for the knees, back
and neck.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.206
Oh, they're great!

02:21.208 --> 02:22.508
They're just elastic bands.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.509
I'm bringing in
a line of healing crystals

02:24.512 --> 02:25.710
On the next infomercial.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.445
Very powerful.

02:33.187 --> 02:35.587
- We're good.
- Okay.

02:35.623 --> 02:39.057
Well, I got to jet,
but just remember...

02:39.126 --> 02:40.993
Both: Keep it loose
with dr. Dela cruz!

02:40.995 --> 02:43.328
(laughing)

02:43.397 --> 02:46.465
Look at him go. Look at him go.
Bye, dr. Dela cruz.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.066
Oh, man.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.402
"loose" and "cruz"
don't even rhyme.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.471
I love that guy.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.972
I wish there was
a healing crystal

02:54.107 --> 02:55.540
That would make him slow down.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.475
Yeah. You know,
just really live in the moment.

02:57.511 --> 02:58.677
And just--

02:58.746 --> 02:59.978
(inhaling and exhaling)

03:00.113 --> 03:02.614
I meant his car.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.349
Man, if I had gotten
that community development job

03:04.418 --> 03:05.883
We would've had
a speed bump here by now.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.986
So, why don't you
just put in a request?

03:09.823 --> 03:12.290
Yeah. A concerned citizen

03:12.326 --> 03:14.492
Can still make their community
a better place.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.694
A now that bob is not retired,

03:19.333 --> 03:21.233

03:30.210 --> 03:31.976
I'm stuck in the suburbs.
I'm broke.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.113
I haven't had a good cup
of coffee since paris.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.648
No offence.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.117
What's so good about
the coffee in paris?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.453
Mannix's mom taught us
to make the perfect café crème.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.121
Is that like a cappuccino?

03:43.190 --> 03:44.856
Totally different.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.391
You start with the perfect
arabica beans

03:46.460 --> 03:47.726
And the right temperature
of water.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.327
Sounds like a cappuccino.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.095
- Topped with foamed milk.
- Yeah, it's a cappuccino.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.397
But it's served in a bowl.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.565
Literally a cappuccino
in a bowl?

03:53.634 --> 03:54.933
No. It's more than that.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.368
It's a way of life.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.536
Fine. Show me.

03:58.606 --> 03:59.771
Really?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.573
What, you have arabica beans?

04:01.642 --> 04:04.142
Yeah. In the back, on the rack
labelled "cappuccino."

04:04.144 --> 04:05.510
Okay.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.950
I'm cam pham eats,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.552
And this is not
your nanny's naan.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.489
And cut. Nice work, girl!

04:17.491 --> 04:20.292
Camille pham.
Internet food sensation.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.027
Oh, man.
You are absolutely crushing it.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.830
- I mean, look at these views.
- What can I say?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.398
I'm a woman of the people.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.502
What's happening with
your face right now?

04:30.571 --> 04:33.204
Hmm. "this dish is a fail."

04:33.274 --> 04:34.640
"she's so cringe."

04:34.775 --> 04:37.175
"is this even
authentic indian?"

04:37.244 --> 04:39.210
"that's the tiktok cramp lady."

04:39.280 --> 04:41.513
What the hell is this?

04:41.515 --> 04:43.582
It's probably just
some dumb internet troll.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.117
Online hate is part of the game.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.051
Everyone successful gets it.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.920
This is a milestone!
Look at you.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.123
You have views, online hate,

04:51.125 --> 04:52.590
And we've got that thing
with devin pate tomorrow.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.526
Right. Podcast.

04:54.528 --> 04:57.596
So, um, what are we going to do
about those comments, though?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.431
Nothing.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.066
Seriously, camille, you
got to ignore the online hate.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.601
And I have to go meet with
a client.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.604
You're taking on clients?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.873
I mean, you're blowing up,
but we're not there yet.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.676
Yeah, of course.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.679
So, how many clients
are you taking on?

05:13.814 --> 05:15.947
I don't know.
I just got the four right now.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.283
Um, I will see you tomorrow.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.118
Four?

05:20.154 --> 05:23.154
That's, like, all the good
members of the backstreet boys.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.762
Everyone needs to sign
the paperwork

05:30.798 --> 05:33.765
So we can start the application
for a speed bump.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.100
This seems like
a really inappropriate use

05:36.136 --> 05:38.770
Of the block-emergency
text thread, andrew.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.572
Don't start with me, clare.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.040
You literally used it
to show everyone

05:42.175 --> 05:43.708
A picture of
your weird birthmark last week.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.310
Did it not look like
dolly parton?

05:45.312 --> 05:46.844
Come on.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.446
People are speeding
through here all the time.

05:48.482 --> 05:51.249
Young renters,
people who are lost,

05:51.318 --> 05:53.785
Tv doctors
in their sports cars.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.654
Dr. Dela cruz is back?
Did he bring my crystals?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.456
Ferdinand isn't even
a real doctor.

05:58.492 --> 05:59.924
You're just jealous.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.659
Of what?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.862
He sells elastic bands.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.063
Basically, a dollar store.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.466
I don't know, man.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.267
He helped me
after my dancing accident.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.603
You just want to be the coolest
asian guy on the block.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.070
That's racist.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.007
You're the one comparing
asians.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.944
Has anyone here ever tried
the tomatoes from his garden?

06:20.013 --> 06:21.880
- I died.
- Andrew: He didn't grow those.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.381
Those are store-bought, man.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.216
Anyways, the point is

06:25.252 --> 06:28.086
People are speeding
on the block,

06:28.221 --> 06:30.622
And we need 80%
of residents to sign.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.690

08:48.395 --> 08:49.494

08:49.629 --> 08:51.162

09:09.182 --> 09:10.849
Okay.
What's your face doing now?

09:10.851 --> 09:13.384
You got to step up
when they step out of line,

09:13.420 --> 09:15.153
Like me and that speed bump.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.789
- Don't let this troll win.
- Okay. I'm going to do it.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.793
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Uh-huh!

09:21.862 --> 09:24.662
(laughing) how do you know
his mom does that?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.063
(chuckling) I don't.

09:29.102 --> 09:33.605
I don't know, guys.
It looks kind of uneven.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.941
It's still settling.

09:36.944 --> 09:39.744
I have to admit,
it has slowed people down.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.746
It's perfect.

09:41.881 --> 09:44.015
Sam:
Hey. What's that?

09:44.084 --> 09:47.552
Andrew:
Oh, you know. Just going rogue.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.354
(cackling)

09:49.356 --> 09:52.757
Okay. Well, apparently, your
wife has been going rogue, too.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.991
Have you seen this?

09:56.697 --> 09:57.928
Hmm.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.099
- You were part of it.
- What?

10:04.371 --> 10:06.170
Maybe just the dms.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.838
There are dms?

10:07.874 --> 10:09.774
That speed bump is a legal
and literal nightmare.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.009
Your sense of proportion
is disgusting.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.511
- (horn honking)
- here he comes.

10:16.483 --> 10:17.882
Andrew, he doesn't see the bump.
He doesn't see the bump.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.651
Hey, hey. Slow down!

10:19.720 --> 10:21.019
That's what a speed bump
is for.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.522
Ah!

10:24.591 --> 10:27.492
- Oh!
- Ow. Oh.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.927
Ow. Ugh!

10:29.963 --> 10:32.129
- I knew you were a racist.
- Clare--

10:32.165 --> 10:34.466
- Dr. Dela cruz: Ow, ow, ow!
- Oh, this is bad, buddy.

10:34.601 --> 10:35.833
What can I do to fix this?

10:35.902 --> 10:38.135
Um, I think you've done enough.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.305
- You okay, dr. Dela cruz?
- (moaning)

10:43.744 --> 10:46.411
I thought we agreed
not to respond to online trolls.

10:46.413 --> 10:47.679
Well, you do things without me,

10:47.748 --> 10:48.680
So I thought
maybe I do the same.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.348
What is that supposed to mean?

10:50.417 --> 10:53.351
They attacked the cultural
authenticity of my work.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.553
So, I had to fight back,
and now it's done.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.021
Oh. Okay.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.289
"you wouldn't know culture if it

10:58.358 --> 11:01.292
Climbed up in your ass
and laid eggs."

11:01.361 --> 11:03.662
He wouldn't! I drew a picture,

11:03.797 --> 11:06.097
But then I was, like,
"too far, girl."

11:06.133 --> 11:09.033
Ah.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.169
Too far, girl.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.737
"I've dropped farts
that taste better

11:12.873 --> 11:14.105
Than anything you've cooked."

11:14.240 --> 11:15.640
I come from a family
of stepper-uppers.

11:15.709 --> 11:16.708
So, I stepped up.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.276
Oh, oh. Like andrew,

11:18.411 --> 11:20.845
Who's about to be sued
by the dr. Dela cruz?

11:20.980 --> 11:22.714
Also, when were you going to
tell me

11:22.783 --> 11:24.549
That dr. Dela cruz
lives on your block?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.184
He'd make a great client.

11:26.319 --> 11:28.252
- Okay. Who is suing who now?
- (knocking on door)

11:28.288 --> 11:29.921
And how many clients
do you need?

11:30.056 --> 11:31.523
Oh, oh. That's probably devin.
Are you ready?

11:31.658 --> 11:35.060
Sam! Meh.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.133
♪ I believe I'm meant to try
and play ♪

11:42.169 --> 11:43.667
Ah.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.471
Nope.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.509
Hey, kiddo!

11:51.511 --> 11:53.611
Why are you being so nice?

11:53.647 --> 11:57.248
Uh, just happy to see you.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.885
Could you make me another one
of those café crèmes?

12:01.020 --> 12:03.488
I guess.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.290
Exactly like yesterday.
And you know, if you want to

12:06.326 --> 12:09.093
Just talk the steps out loud
a little, that'd be great.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.696
I'd love one, too,
if you're taking orders.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.768
You know, I'm actually
a little short-handed today,

12:16.770 --> 12:18.302
So if you wanted to

12:18.304 --> 12:21.573
Stick around,
make a few more of those--

12:21.708 --> 12:23.908
- Yeah, okay.
- Uh, excuse me.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.579
The bathroom is locked.
Is there a key?

12:27.714 --> 12:29.180
Well, if it's locked,
someone's in there.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.115
Okay. What do I do?

12:31.184 --> 12:33.651
You hold it.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.921
♪ ah-ah-ah ♪

12:37.056 --> 12:40.592

12:40.727 --> 12:43.127

12:43.130 --> 12:44.796
♪ na-na-na na-na-da ♪

12:44.931 --> 12:48.332
And that's when I decided
to quit my job

12:48.368 --> 12:50.534
And pursue my passion.
Do what I love, you know?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.337
And you've been doing it
so well, camille.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.005
I mean,
your online tutorial videos,

12:54.074 --> 12:55.739
They're a hit.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.342
Cam pham eats is a growing
in-home catering business.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.610
I mean, you've got to be happy.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.010
I am.

13:00.012 --> 13:02.080
I'm proud to be
a woman of colour

13:02.082 --> 13:03.214
Bringing my culture's food
to more people.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.816
And that's great.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.584
That's really great.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.420
But I got to ask, has it
always been smooth sailing?

13:09.422 --> 13:13.024
Well, every business
has its growing pains,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.359
But, um, so far, so good.
(laughing nervously)

13:15.428 --> 13:17.027
Devin:
That's interesting,

13:17.063 --> 13:18.963
Because this morning,
things got a little nasty

13:19.098 --> 13:21.866
With a commenter
on one of your videos.

13:21.902 --> 13:26.171
Oh. Well, you know, what I would
really love to talk about

13:26.306 --> 13:29.307
Is our work with local vendors
to source ingredients.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.643
Hmm. The only local ingredient
I want to source

13:31.778 --> 13:33.377
Is this online beef.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.581
Is it common for you
to get so aggressive

13:36.650 --> 13:39.017
With people who don't like
your posts and content?

13:39.152 --> 13:43.922
Well, you know, I was just
really trying to clarify

13:44.057 --> 13:47.692
Some criticisms.
I mean, they were all justified.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.661
See, I am an excellent dancer.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.863
Perfect. Perfect.
So, if you stand by

13:51.932 --> 13:53.464
Every single thing
that you said, you won't mind

13:53.533 --> 13:55.266
Reading a few snippets

13:55.401 --> 13:56.868
For my listeners.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.736
Had to censor a few things

13:58.805 --> 14:00.638
Given the vulgar nature
of the content.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.540
(laughing nervously)

14:02.542 --> 14:05.543
"you piece of beep.

14:05.612 --> 14:09.680
"I should beep-beep-beep
all over your beep.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.550
Beep around and find out."

14:12.685 --> 14:16.554
Okay.
I am both proud and embarrassed.

14:16.689 --> 14:20.291
Huh. "embarrassed" came second.
You heard it here.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.625
(laughing)

14:21.661 --> 14:23.895
Devin:
Okay. (clearing throat)

14:25.698 --> 14:29.167
It's the end of an era.
I'll pop you one.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.435
I'm very disappointed
in you guys.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.805
I didn't mean for ferdinand
to get hurt.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.306
Yeah, right.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.508
You probably took out a hit
on dr. Dela cruz

14:37.577 --> 14:39.443
And then took the job yourself.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.914
You don't build a speed bump
to kill somebody, sebastian.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.516
You kill somebody, and then
you put them in the speed bump.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.852
You would know, killer bee.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.120
Ugh.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.256
(shovel scraping)

14:52.325 --> 14:53.758
Hey, man. Okay.

14:53.827 --> 14:55.459
So, we got a little too festive
with it.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.129
Doesn't mean we should
stop helping the community.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.731
You telling me
to keep going rogue?

14:59.733 --> 15:03.001
Just fly a little
under the radar, you know?

15:03.003 --> 15:07.271
Oh. Stealth rogue.
I like it.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.609
- D'oh.
- D'oh.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.212
Clare:
Doctor killers.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.347
He ain't even a real doctor!

15:16.383 --> 15:18.048
Stop ruining the moment, clare.

15:20.353 --> 15:23.221
Oh. Man, you should probably
talk to dr. Dela cruz, though.

15:23.223 --> 15:26.291
(sighing) moment ruined.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.630
Devin: And then
an hour later, you write,

15:32.632 --> 15:35.433
"his beep is the last thing
I'd ever beep with

15:35.568 --> 15:37.168
If my beeping life depended
on it."

15:37.237 --> 15:40.104
I mean, really, camille?
You going after the nephew now?

15:40.239 --> 15:42.773
Okay. Is this the whole podcast?

15:42.809 --> 15:44.976
Just, like, reading back
my clever clap-backs?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.645
Are we ever going to
actually talk about the food?

15:47.714 --> 15:49.781
Okay. You know what? We're done.
This was a mistake.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.515
Devin, I'm going to need you
to delete that file.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.052
Wait a second.
That nephew thing was a dm.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.319
How do you have that?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.055
Oopsie-doo. (laughing)

15:58.091 --> 15:59.657
You're the troll?

15:59.726 --> 16:02.059
Got me. Lock me up.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.996
You (bleep) piece of (bleep)!

16:05.065 --> 16:06.097
You (bleep) cheese.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.999
And this podcast?

16:08.001 --> 16:09.433
This is horse (bleep),

16:09.502 --> 16:11.101
And anyone who listens
to your (bleep)

16:11.137 --> 16:15.539
Is a (bleep)-eating,
(bleep)-smelling (bleep)!

16:18.578 --> 16:21.345
I'm devin pate,
and that's all the time we have

16:21.414 --> 16:24.715
On the devin made me do it,
roast edition.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.885
Don't forget our sponsors,
jeff's stiff lemon drink.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.887
When regular lemon drink
won't get you up,

16:29.923 --> 16:32.222
Try jeff's stiff lemon drink.

16:32.258 --> 16:33.691
Still in cherry flavour.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.094
What is your game, man?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.096
Uh, drama equals clicks.
Clicks equals listens,

16:38.231 --> 16:40.431
And listens are
the lifeblood of a podcast.

16:40.566 --> 16:42.566
Okay. I am sorry
for the (bleep) outburst,

16:42.602 --> 16:44.035
But you can't seriously
post that.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.470
No.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.104
Are you serious?
I'm definitely posting that.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.906
This is the best podcast
I've ever done.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.909
Unapologetic chef,
rage-y producer? This is like--

16:51.978 --> 16:53.978
It's like true crime meets food.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.246
I am not consenting to this.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.515
Oh.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.050
I mean, you already did.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.851
Sam submitted the releases
last week.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.124
Devin: Oh, hey.
No publicity is bad publicity.

17:06.259 --> 17:09.560
Well, this is very much
bad publicity.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.528
(flippantly)
well, time will tell on that.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.798
(sighing) okay. That's it.
Time for you to go. Leave.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.833
- Oh, I'm going.
- Okay. Fine.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.267
I am. Sorry. This is just
a little stuck for us.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.536
Just don't tangle--
that's tangled.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.804
Okay.
Well, is there a plug, or--

17:19.873 --> 17:21.472
- Yes.
- Okay.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.811
Hey, kiddo,
thanks for your help today.

17:26.946 --> 17:28.813
Those café crèmes are a hit.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.114
Yeah. I'm happy to help.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.418
What's this?

17:34.421 --> 17:35.953
Four hours of work plus tips.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.088
You want to come back tomorrow?

17:37.223 --> 17:38.289
Wait. Like, a real job?

17:38.424 --> 17:41.559
Yeah. I need the help,

17:41.694 --> 17:43.294
And when school starts,

17:43.296 --> 17:45.162
You can have as many
weekend shifts as you want.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.832
Plus I still haven't figured out

17:47.967 --> 17:50.101
How you get that foam
just right.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.435
Okay.

17:51.437 --> 17:54.438
(sighing) another cancellation.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.706
They don't want to work
with someone

17:55.708 --> 17:57.641
Who uses the lord's name
in vain.

17:57.677 --> 18:00.711
That's fair. Even andrew
was worried about that one.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.513
Look. It'll be fine.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.448
People will have forgotten
about this in a week.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.321
It bothered me that
you were meeting with clients

18:11.357 --> 18:13.991
And taking on more legal work.

18:14.060 --> 18:15.793
Um, whoa. Okay.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.395
I don't know why it bothered me,
but it did.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.864
I mean, you can do other things.

18:19.933 --> 18:22.133
I just-- I thought we were
in this together.

18:22.202 --> 18:26.137
We are. But camille,
we're barely breaking even here.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.606
I know.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.274
And I should've listened.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.376
From now on,
I will focus on the food.

18:33.780 --> 18:34.946
Okay.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.548
I'll be honest. I may have left

18:37.584 --> 18:38.950
A bunch of bad reviews

18:39.085 --> 18:41.486
From anonymous accounts
on devin's podcast.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.686
Oh, yeah. Same.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.555
But no more hate, okay?

18:44.690 --> 18:45.622
Starting now.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.958
- Well--
- well--

18:47.093 --> 18:48.292
Both:
Now.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.833
Why do you hate dr. Dela cruz
so much?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.968
"hate" is such a strong word.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.437
Dad--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.372
Maybe he does threaten me
a little.

19:01.441 --> 19:03.241
He's just so cool
and successful.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.642
So are you.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.043
Aw, thanks buddy.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.179
- Well, maybe not successful.
- Okay.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.381
Actually, you're not really
that cool anymore, either.

19:10.383 --> 19:11.649
Stop talking now.

19:11.651 --> 19:15.586
Hey, ferdinand.
I'm sorry, man.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.454
I shouldn't have put in
that speed bump.

19:17.524 --> 19:20.057
All is forgiven, andy.

19:20.126 --> 19:21.758
This whole experience
is a reminder

19:21.794 --> 19:24.261
To slow down and be more aware.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.866
Life is a journey
and mistakes will happen,

19:29.001 --> 19:31.802
But forgiveness
is free to give.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.005
If you can forgive me,
I can forgive you, andy.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.076
Yeah, sure. Cool.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.879
Dr. Dela cruz--

19:41.948 --> 19:44.482
Your father is a great man, leo.

19:44.484 --> 19:47.084
Even if he is the second-coolest
asian on the block.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.519
- (laughing)
- (laughing)

19:48.654 --> 19:50.288
Just joking.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.156
I know. He's pretty great.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.293
Well, let me know if I can pay
for any of the damages.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.095
It might just take a while,

19:58.131 --> 20:00.097
Since we have no money
at the moment.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.700
No, no, andy. I won't have it.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.568
The cost
of speeding through life

20:04.571 --> 20:06.570
Is one that I shall pay myself.

20:07.773 --> 20:10.241
Awesome. Bye.

20:10.243 --> 20:14.579
But maybe there's one thing.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.047
(sighing)

20:20.653 --> 20:22.586
(cheesy '80s music playing)

20:22.655 --> 20:25.990
My miracle bands help you build
the strength and flexibility

20:25.992 --> 20:27.858
To get moving again.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.060
But don't listen to me.

20:29.195 --> 20:33.597
Listen to
one of its real users.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.332
That's right, dr. Dela cruz.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.334
These miracle
strengthening bands

20:37.403 --> 20:39.403
Gave me my life back.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.005
Before the miracle bands,

20:41.007 --> 20:43.741
My knees were cottage cheese

20:43.743 --> 20:46.010
And I could barely move.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.879
But after using them,
I feel loose

20:48.881 --> 20:51.815
Like dr. Dela cruz.

20:56.022 --> 21:00.358
And these crystals
are making me jump higher.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.627
Audience members:
Whoa!

21:02.762 --> 21:06.363
Keep it loose
with dr. Dela cruz.
