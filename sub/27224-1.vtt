[Richard] It is said that those who venture into White Space

01:00.190 --> 01:02.236
are cleansed of all impurities,

01:03.280 --> 01:05.065
both mind and body.

01:07.415 --> 01:08.459
No disease...

[creature wails in distance]

...no suffering.

Absolute clarity.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.642
But the key to White Space...

01:17.686 --> 01:19.862
resides
in its celestial guardian,

01:21.559 --> 01:22.691
Tien Lung.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.652
[Richard] Those who attempt
to pass

with vicious resistance.

01:32.353 --> 01:34.006

01:59.597 --> 02:01.164
She's blocking Ten Lung.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.644
[Hawthorne]
I'm gonna put her down.

02:02.687 --> 02:04.167
[Bentley] Attack the neck

We here at Ambercorp

03:21.288 --> 03:22.593
are committed to working

03:22.637 --> 03:25.248
with the Mining
and Fishing Federation

03:25.292 --> 03:27.555
to bring you the freshest,

03:27.598 --> 03:30.340
parasite-free food

03:30.384 --> 03:33.474

03:33.517 --> 03:36.999
Now, if you have an appetite
for clicker,

03:37.042 --> 03:42.700

This is the place.

03:58.325 --> 04:00.240

04:00.283 --> 04:01.806
Our boy should be inside.

[Lynn]
There's a guard at the door.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.317
I'll pull up the details

Everywhere Ten Lung
has appeared and disappeared.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.170
Maybe even into White Space.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.391
Why paper?

05:04.434 --> 05:07.045
Anything electronic
has a tracking signature.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.830
Paper can't be traced.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.266
Boomer tricks of the trade.

05:32.984 --> 05:35.378
Be careful
and stay out of sight.

05:37.946 --> 05:41.297
[Ahab] You deliver Ten Lung
without ICE entanglements,

05:41.341 --> 05:43.430
you'll bank five seasons
worth of hauls for it.

05:44.866 --> 05:47.434
The Essex has solid harpoons,

05:47.477 --> 05:49.087
she'll take Ten Lung down.

05:49.131 --> 05:50.480
You'll need them.

05:50.524 --> 05:53.309
They say energy weapons
don't affect it.

He always spoke
very highly of you.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.857
So why are you setting us up?

06:23.078 --> 06:24.688
I don't understand.

06:24.732 --> 06:27.169
Why is ICE watching us...

06:27.212 --> 06:29.040
the same night you show up?

06:29.998 --> 06:30.999
Well, I have...

Your Mining and Fishing escort
will be waiting

08:16.583 --> 08:18.062
along with your supply order.

08:18.672 --> 08:19.890
Control out.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.199
And that's your cover.

08:24.242 --> 08:25.417
If anybody goes digging,

08:25.461 --> 08:28.420
your ICE records
have been wiped clean.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.945
We'll be able to stay in contact
about 80 mega-clicks out,

08:30.988 --> 08:32.076
but after that,

08:32.120 --> 08:33.424
all transmissions
will have to come

08:33.469 --> 08:35.427
from the main
communications deck.

08:35.471 --> 08:37.081
You get in a bind,

08:37.125 --> 08:39.475
you locate the ship's beacon,
you activate it.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.565

Do you think going

She thinks so.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.451
[Owen] Hey, we're heading home
after one more harvest.

08:59.495 --> 09:00.714
We need a babysitter now.

It's gonna be

09:03.804 --> 09:05.414
Yeah, it probably got
a ponytail.

The ship will smell
like patchouli oil.

As if Stubs wasn't bad enough.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.637
[Richard] We pick him up,
show him one haul

09:10.680 --> 09:11.942

A pleasure to meet you both.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.311
Why don't you take care
of Miss Navarro?

09:33.355 --> 09:34.399
You can call me Lynn.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.185
You can call me Captain.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.100
She's all yours.

09:39.143 --> 09:40.144
Aye, aye, Captain.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.193
[Owen] He's like sandpaper,

09:45.236 --> 09:46.542
he'll wear off on you
after a while.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.370
Come on.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.546
Stubs will grab your bag
with the supplies.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.028
And there he is now.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.072
Hey.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.859
He's a real lady killer.

09:58.902 --> 09:59.990
[Owen] I'll give you
a quick tour.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.688
All the hallways
kinda look the same.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.603
These stairs lead

[Ragsland] I can't believe
they're sticking us

10:27.975 --> 10:29.411
with a chaperone.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.152
This ain't the prom.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.849
The boys may be happy about it.

10:32.893 --> 10:34.764
[Ragsland] What is she, easy?

10:34.808 --> 10:36.070
[Richard] Easy on the eyes.

10:37.462 --> 10:38.855
Let's blow this Taco stand.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.649
[tense music]

10:54.871 --> 10:56.568
[Owen] We're like
a dysfunctional family,

10:56.612 --> 10:58.962
fighting over
one shared bathroom.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
But you do get your own locker,

11:01.704 --> 11:02.662
right next to me.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.447

Flick, flick, flick.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.560
[Harpo] Flush.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.954
Flush right down

-Full boat.
-Goddamn it, old man.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.959
Fucking sharkin' me man.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.569
[Lynn] So how long
have you guys been together?

11:40.612 --> 11:41.788
Past three or four years.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.094
[Lynn] Is that a cry tube?

11:44.138 --> 11:45.922
[Owen] It was,
now it's a fridge.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.750
[fridge hisses]

11:47.794 --> 11:49.186
This is Lynn,
our Mining and Fishing escort.

11:49.230 --> 11:51.536
Stay away from my pots, my pan,

11:51.580 --> 11:53.277
and my man.

11:53.321 --> 11:55.410
We'll get along
like two peas in a pod.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.673
Batali, our cook.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.719
And resident poet.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.985
She wasn't kidding.
She's only got one pan.

12:05.028 --> 12:06.334
[Owen] Ship's an old
Russian harpooner,

12:07.683 --> 12:09.685
when people had to sleep
for deep-space travel.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.079
But we've pretty much
retro-fitted the whole thing.

Boo-boo!

12:13.994 --> 12:15.082
Hey, Boo-Boo.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.823
Nice touch
with the locker, guys.

12:16.866 --> 12:17.911
Payback's a bitch.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.347
Hey, don't blame me.

[Harpo and Ragsland chuckle]

12:23.525 --> 12:25.092

Rags, this is our escort, Lynn.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.096
The Neanderthal is Harpo.

12:29.139 --> 12:30.314
And last but not least,

12:30.358 --> 12:32.142
our first mate, Ben Hawthorne.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.883
He served with my dad
on the Acushnet.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.702
[Price] Here's the download
on the crew members.

13:10.746 --> 13:13.749
You got a real circus act
out there.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.273
[Price] Let's start
with William Stubniski.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.101
Two counts of felony vandalism.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.277
He fell asleep
with a plasma cutter,

13:20.321 --> 13:21.757
blowing a couple of fuel rods

13:21.801 --> 13:24.194
and destroying a cargo ship.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.457
-First mate Benjamin Hawthorne.-[Hawthorne singing]

13:26.501 --> 13:29.373
[Price] Honorable discharge,
but did a stint for poaching.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.245
After serving on the Acushnet,

13:31.288 --> 13:33.073
it seems he developed
a guilty conscience

13:33.116 --> 13:35.249
along with a drinking habit.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.946
Then we have
the captain's little brother,

13:36.990 --> 13:38.556
Owen Bentley.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.297
He was a hotshot pod pilot

13:40.341 --> 13:42.996
until his maverick attitude forced him into civilian life.

13:44.780 --> 13:46.390
Oh, this one's good.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.696
Piper Batali.

13:47.739 --> 13:49.698
Three convictions for assault

13:49.741 --> 13:51.700
with a frying pan.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.876
Let's just say
she's the jealous type.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.879
Which isn't too good for her boyfriend, James Harpo.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.533
He owes massive gambling debts

13:58.576 --> 14:01.101
and is gonna need a huge catch
to pay it all off.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.409
Then you have Sarah Ragsland.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.107
She was on her way
to a court martial,

14:07.150 --> 14:08.804
until rumors of affairs

14:08.848 --> 14:11.763
with several high-ranking officers surfaced.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.504
Suddenly, this little bunny
hopped her way

14:13.548 --> 14:14.766
right into pilot school.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.336
Last but not least
is our good friend,

14:19.380 --> 14:21.077
Captain Richard Bentley.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.774
Highly decorated

14:22.818 --> 14:25.865
and finished top of his class in Aviation and Stellar mapping.

14:25.908 --> 14:26.909
Unfortunately for him,

14:26.953 --> 14:28.432
he has anger management issues

14:28.476 --> 14:30.043
and was dishonorable discharged

14:30.086 --> 14:32.828
after knocking his commanding officer out cold.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.094
You're betting a lot
on a legend.

14:40.096 --> 14:41.315
But I hope you find

14:41.358 --> 14:42.620
what you're looking for
out there.

[beeps]

24:44.004 --> 24:45.614
We're in deep.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.876
The, uh...

24:46.920 --> 24:49.705
edge of the Hyperion
star system.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.229
The furthest depths
of the galaxy.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.710
[Bentley]
All this time searching...

24:54.754 --> 24:56.886
I'm so close to White Space.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.672
Nothing's gonna stop me,

24:59.715 --> 25:00.760
Not even Ten Lung.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.719
He's, uh...

25:03.763 --> 25:05.329
He's as big as they say

25:05.373 --> 25:06.853
and mean as a son of a bitch.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.683
But, um...

25:10.726 --> 25:13.076
a captain never loses sight
of the mission at hand.

25:15.426 --> 25:17.559
[birds chirping]

25:17.603 --> 25:18.778
[Bentley]
You need some help, buddy?

25:20.127 --> 25:21.650
I can do it myself.

25:28.091 --> 25:29.266
Here.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.354
[Richard] What's this?

25:30.398 --> 25:31.530
It's your birthday present.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.445
Better late than never, right?

25:35.011 --> 25:36.926
[rasps]

25:36.970 --> 25:38.928
[Bentley on video]
You tell Owen...

25:38.972 --> 25:40.277
that I'm bringing him the hide

25:40.321 --> 25:41.844
of the biggest,
baddest celbaleen

25:41.888 --> 25:43.542
to ever roam these stars.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.414
And, um...

25:48.198 --> 25:49.722
take care of your mom
for me, okay?

25:52.942 --> 25:53.987
[Ragsland] Captain.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.031
Two ships.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.557
A patrol? This far out?

25:59.514 --> 26:00.515
[Ragsland] Too small.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.261

They're moving in fast.

26:16.966 --> 26:18.228
Run like hell.

26:18.272 --> 26:19.447
You got it.

[Essex terminal] Unidentified vessel approaching.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.638
[Owen] Jesus,
turn these things off.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.726
You're gonna give me a seizure.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.119
Boomers are gaining on us.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.468
Never seen a Boomer before.

26:40.511 --> 26:41.904
Well, don't say
I never got you anything.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.994
[whooshes]

26:54.003 --> 26:55.309
Attention!

26:55.352 --> 26:56.745
Boomers on our bow.

26:57.572 --> 26:58.834
Prepare for company.

26:58.878 --> 27:00.444
Dump the empty crates
and let 'em chase 'em.

27:00.488 --> 27:01.837
That'll just piss them off.

27:01.881 --> 27:03.709
They'll catch us eventually.

27:03.752 --> 27:04.927
This is our only choice.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.416
[Essex terminal]
Docking sequence activated.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.767
Boomers? He means pirates?

27:18.811 --> 27:21.509
Fuckin' academy didn't waste
any time training you, did they?

27:21.552 --> 27:22.728
Follow me.

Unless you enjoy being raped.

This is not a drill.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.022
[clanking]

27:56.065 --> 27:58.328
[chuckles]
I was wondering where this went.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.682
All right, two, three.

Let's go,
get your asses in here.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.757
[Owen] Are you kidding me?

28:35.801 --> 28:36.802
[Batali] I'm not letting anyone
take it.

28:39.892 --> 28:40.936
What're you waiting on?

28:44.853 --> 28:46.115
[Owen] Whoa!

28:46.159 --> 28:48.074
Put that away
before you get someone killed!

28:48.117 --> 28:49.945
Nobody moves unless you hear
the order from me.

28:49.989 --> 28:50.990
Got that?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.780
Don't touch it.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.043
[groans]
This is gonna be cozy.

29:05.308 --> 29:06.309
[Batali] Ssh.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.751
Permission to come aboard.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.414
We forgot the gift baskets.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.201
Here, hold this, Lieutenant.

29:31.639 --> 29:32.858
[boomer captain] I'm betting
you've spent a fair amount

29:32.901 --> 29:34.990
of years up here, haven't you,
old man?

29:36.644 --> 29:40.561
Which ship did you sail on
before this shit box?

29:40.604 --> 29:41.649
The Acushnet.

29:42.737 --> 29:43.825
Oh!

29:43.869 --> 29:45.871
And someone lives
to tell the tale.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.090
[boomers chuckling]

29:51.659 --> 29:53.704
Good harvest this year, Captain?

29:55.881 --> 29:57.665
I've had better.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.841
[boomer captain] Well, space
isn't what it used to be, is it?

29:59.885 --> 30:01.408
I'm always complaining
to my boys

30:01.451 --> 30:05.325
how these star systems have been
overharvested nowadays.

30:08.023 --> 30:09.024
Trying times.

People gotta eat,

30:11.810 --> 30:14.029
price of a clicker
at an all-time high.

30:14.813 --> 30:15.814
We manage.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.123
It would appear so.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.690
And where are my manners?

30:22.733 --> 30:24.170
-[clacking]
-[groans]

30:28.087 --> 30:29.740
Well.

30:29.784 --> 30:31.394
[boomer captain] And this is?

30:31.438 --> 30:34.180
She's our MFF escort.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.879
You can imagine
how these long jags...

30:37.923 --> 30:39.446
roughen a man's edges.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.450
Civility's thrown
right out the porthole...

30:43.493 --> 30:44.755
You know where our haul is.
Take it and go--

30:44.799 --> 30:46.105
-[Richard] Owen!
-[indistinct chatter]

30:46.148 --> 30:48.455
Hey! Hey! Hey!

30:48.498 --> 30:51.893
Illegal transporting, piracy,
theft.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.765
Do you want to add
a section nine, assault?

30:54.809 --> 30:57.638
Oh, you sure know
your penal codes.

30:57.681 --> 30:59.074
Isn't this a fishing vessel?

31:00.554 --> 31:02.295
[sniffs]

31:02.338 --> 31:04.558
Something definitely
smells fishy.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.913
[rasping, clinks]

31:22.489 --> 31:23.925
So you have an ICE Queen
on board?

31:27.973 --> 31:29.191
I guess we do.

31:36.633 --> 31:37.678
Boys.

31:39.027 --> 31:40.855
Take it all.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.250
-[grunts]
-[moans]

31:46.295 --> 31:48.297
Well, it has been
a pleasure, Captain.

31:49.472 --> 31:50.952
You got what you came for.

31:51.822 --> 31:52.823
Just go.

31:54.434 --> 31:55.914
Well, we should all
do this again,

31:56.827 --> 31:57.916
real soon.

31:59.613 --> 32:00.614
Tag it.

32:07.186 --> 32:08.970
[Owen groans]

32:11.842 --> 32:15.411
What the fuck is an ICE agent
doing on my ship?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.326
-You gonna help him?
-[Owen] I'm fine.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.676
-I want answers.
-[Harpo] Dumb bitch.

32:19.720 --> 32:21.504
She must have sent out
a transmission with our course.

32:21.548 --> 32:24.333
You might as well have left
a blood trail for sharks.

32:24.377 --> 32:25.595
-Lock her up.
-What?

32:25.639 --> 32:27.162
-My pleasure.
-[Owen] Rich, come on.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.034
-[Stubs] Hey, maybe we should--
-Shut the fuck up, Stubs.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.296
You're making a huge mistake.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.776
Oh, you come on my ship,
lie about who you are,

32:32.820 --> 32:34.039
put the entire crew at risk,

32:34.082 --> 32:36.041
and I'm making a mistake?

32:36.084 --> 32:37.216
Pirates are gonna be
the last thing

32:37.259 --> 32:38.304
you're worried about.

32:38.347 --> 32:39.479
Get her out of here.

32:41.568 --> 32:43.004
Now, we all get a number nine.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.147
[clacking]

33:08.551 --> 33:09.900
[boomer lieutenant]
Their ship's tagged.

33:09.944 --> 33:11.511
If they send a signal
from anywhere,

33:11.554 --> 33:12.555
we'll track them.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.122
Excellent.

33:15.819 --> 33:16.907
[beeping]

33:23.262 --> 33:25.568

[beeps]

33:45.066 --> 33:46.720
[creature wailing]

33:54.902 --> 33:56.469
[Harpo] I just spent
the last nine months

33:56.512 --> 33:58.862
getting my ass hauled
across the galaxy.

33:58.906 --> 33:59.950
Only to be cleaned out

33:59.994 --> 34:01.517
by a bunch
of fucking buccaneers.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.519
That's all they left us.

34:09.917 --> 34:10.918
Where'd you get that?

34:12.137 --> 34:13.529
It's not my first rodeo.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.012
We got two options.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.059
Go home-empty handed...

34:23.061 --> 34:24.279
or get the grand prize.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.369
We take down Ten Lung.

34:28.630 --> 34:30.371
You salty bastard.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.723
Guys, we have an undercover
ICE agent locked up.

34:33.766 --> 34:34.811
She's right.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.684
I mean, you expect
to get a 16-ton

34:37.726 --> 34:40.165
nearly extinct creature
across customs?

34:40.208 --> 34:41.731
[Ragsland] With what?

34:41.775 --> 34:43.907
A wink and a nod?

34:43.951 --> 34:46.344
Look, we've been stuck
in this tin can for months

34:46.388 --> 34:48.563
fighting for scraps.

34:48.608 --> 34:50.088
And now we don't even have that.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.047
I have a guy that will give us

34:53.091 --> 34:54.918
five seasons worth of hauls
for this thing.

34:56.224 --> 34:57.225
[Richard] Think about that.

34:58.574 --> 34:59.793
Early retirement.

35:01.229 --> 35:02.752
[Richard] No more cooking
for this bunch.

35:05.538 --> 35:06.539
Your own ship.

35:09.977 --> 35:11.326
Not having to lift a finger.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.764
Never ending happy hour.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.596
Taking down a legend.

35:23.991 --> 35:24.992
All right.

35:26.602 --> 35:27.864
But if we do this,

35:27.908 --> 35:29.823
we gotta get some clicks
or we're gonna starve.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.173
And, Stubs,

35:32.217 --> 35:34.306
you need to get
the damn hyperspeed up.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.829
You need to do something, too.

35:37.222 --> 35:39.180
[somber music]

35:44.272 --> 35:45.534
[Richard] You got something
on your mind?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.973
[Hawthorne] A galaxy this big...

35:51.932 --> 35:53.151
what are the odds?

35:54.674 --> 35:55.892
A billion to one,

35:55.936 --> 35:57.764
this is the same one
that killed your dad?

35:57.807 --> 35:58.982
Oh, it's Ten Lung.

36:00.114 --> 36:01.376
And you know it.

36:01.420 --> 36:02.943
[Hawthorne] The only thing
I do know for sure

36:02.986 --> 36:04.249
is we're still alive.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.993
I can't say the same
about your father.

36:16.783 --> 36:18.350
We all have our crosses to bear.

36:23.093 --> 36:24.138
Either way...

36:26.967 --> 36:28.186
I'm there to the end.

[door opens]

36:52.688 --> 36:53.689
Hey.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.867
Just wanted to thank you
for my leg and all.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.175
You're welcome...

37:05.788 --> 37:06.833
Boo-boo.

37:06.876 --> 37:07.877
[chuckles]

37:15.668 --> 37:17.147
What're you doing here?

37:17.191 --> 37:18.540
A few months ago,

37:18.584 --> 37:21.891
some scumbag poacher
claimed to have found Tianlong.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.242
The only clue I had
was a star system.

37:25.112 --> 37:26.200
So I began tracking

37:26.244 --> 37:28.202
each sighting
within that star system.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.727
And there's only one ship

37:31.771 --> 37:33.381
that follows that same course.

37:37.559 --> 37:38.691
The Essex.

37:47.787 --> 37:49.310

-About?
-I'm your brother.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.431
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

38:24.693 --> 38:26.260
This is the one that killed dad.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.392
Don't you want this thing dead?

We round up enough of it,
and we're heading home.

38:41.884 --> 38:43.495
We head home

38:45.845 --> 38:47.455

43:20.032 --> 43:21.599

out there!

You put us all at risk.

43:29.171 --> 43:31.347

up and running.

45:28.116 --> 45:29.465
Got the ambergris, right?

45:31.990 --> 45:33.382
[Owen] That should be worth
a chunk of change.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.954
That click's only gonna last us

45:41.869 --> 45:43.349
We can live off the ambergris.

Either way, we can't just mosey
back into the atmosphere now.

[Owen] We didn't touch
the celbaleen,

45:54.142 --> 45:55.361

47:18.661 --> 47:20.228
I could just go out
to the local pharmacy.

47:20.272 --> 47:21.534
I, I just found out.

No.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.367
[grunting]

51:55.634 --> 51:57.723
She put up a fight.

51:57.766 --> 52:00.247
I caught her trying to destroy
some of our oxygen reserves.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.907
She was probably hoping
I'd head back.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.172
I think so, Captain.

52:18.178 --> 52:20.963
I guess she doesn't know me
that well.

52:21.007 --> 52:22.835
[Richard] Have Batali
get her something to eat.

52:27.361 --> 52:28.449
[sighs]

52:41.549 --> 52:42.594
[Richard] Quiet night?

52:45.858 --> 52:47.294
At ease.

52:47.338 --> 52:48.339
Just me.

52:52.386 --> 52:55.172
-How's it looking out there?
-[Ragsland sighs]

52:55.215 --> 52:56.782

52:58.436 --> 52:59.698

53:16.497 --> 53:18.282
[Lynn] You help me...

53:18.325 --> 53:20.284
I will make sure
you walk away from this.

53:20.327 --> 53:22.068
Let go.

53:22.895 --> 53:24.418
Harpo, too.

53:24.462 --> 53:25.593
I cook their meals, all right?

53:25.637 --> 53:27.552
What am I gonna do?

53:27.595 --> 53:30.729
I want to get out of here
just as bad as you do.

53:32.861 --> 53:34.733
I'm going to have a baby.

53:43.568 --> 53:44.656
Check your starboard.

[clicks]

53:47.093 --> 53:48.225

53:58.104 --> 53:59.323
Someone else
must've come out here

53:59.366 --> 54:01.194
looking for the big catch.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.327
[Ragsland] Yeah.
Looks like they found it.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.199
Ten Lung did this?

54:08.332 --> 54:10.029
It's just us and him out here.

54:45.934 --> 54:47.806
[Hawthorne] Don't look
too long now.

54:49.373 --> 54:51.026
A man could get lost out there.

54:55.030 --> 54:56.684
Harpo tampered with the oxygen.

54:58.295 --> 55:01.080
I've been serving seven years
with Harpo.

55:01.123 --> 55:03.038
You put your trust
in a man like that.

55:06.477 --> 55:07.478
But...

55:08.435 --> 55:09.958
man is a funny creature.

55:11.743 --> 55:13.353
[Hawthorne] Sometimes,
he does desperate things

55:13.397 --> 55:14.615
in order to get something done.

55:16.835 --> 55:18.402
Like letting pirates
on his ship.

55:23.581 --> 55:25.974
We need Stubs to fix the leak
in the oxygen tanks.

55:26.018 --> 55:27.324
I was just looking
for him myself.

55:27.367 --> 55:28.325
He went Houdini.

55:29.413 --> 55:30.544
Ship's only so big.

55:32.154 --> 55:33.199
[Richard] I'll take the bow,

56:55.847 --> 56:56.891
[Owen] How's she doing?

56:58.632 --> 57:00.460
Won't be eating clicker
anytime soon.

57:02.288 --> 57:03.942
She's lucky
I was looking for Stubs.

57:05.204 --> 57:06.423
We can't lock her back up.

57:07.511 --> 57:08.686
Fine.

57:08.729 --> 57:10.688
Then she's your responsibility.

57:10.731 --> 57:12.690
Keep her out of my way.

57:12.733 --> 57:14.518
-You've taken this too far.
-Hey.

57:14.561 --> 57:15.736
Listen to me.

57:15.780 --> 57:18.260
We're holding our course.
You understand?

57:18.304 --> 57:21.568
Nothing...
nothing is gonna stop us.

57:21.612 --> 57:22.613
Us?

57:23.831 --> 57:25.050
You don't care about us.

57:26.486 --> 57:28.662
Just like Dad.

57:28.706 --> 57:30.272
Left Mom sick to come up here,
and for what?

57:30.316 --> 57:32.187
You don't know
the first thing about him.

57:32.231 --> 57:33.711
Dad and I talked
about coming up here

57:33.754 --> 57:35.060
when you were still juice.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.409
I know he didn't come back.

57:38.716 --> 57:39.804
You're just like him.

57:40.369 --> 57:41.370

are low, right?

58:43.171 --> 58:44.216
I just fly the ship.

58:45.696 --> 58:48.046
Can't fly shit when you're dead.

How long do you think
it'll take us to get back?

[scoffs]

58:51.484 --> 58:52.833
Look.

58:52.877 --> 58:55.836
Not too many captains
give a young pilot a chance.

I'm not turning my back on him.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.001
Yeah. Mutiny's the last thing
on my mind right now.

01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:04.003
Our oxygen levels are low.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:06.701
If we don't turn back now,
this ship's gonna be our coffin.

01:06:06.745 --> 01:06:10.227
Hey, his own fucking brother
is dead.

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:11.663
He's gonna keep chasing
this thing

01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:13.665
until it destroys the whole ship
and everybody on it.

01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:20.150
[sighs]

01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:23.718
Hawthorne's never
gonna go for it.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:25.416
Fucking Hawthorne.
I'll deal with Hawthorne.

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.634
You need to do this.

01:06:28.071 --> 01:06:29.463
For the life of my kid.

01:06:33.293 --> 01:06:34.425
Bat's pregnant.

01:06:37.732 --> 01:06:38.907
[groans]

01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:40.257
[Richard]
The Hyperion Star System.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.606
[Lynn pants]

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:45.784
[groans]

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:48.265
We're about as far out
as anyone has ever gone.

01:06:52.095 --> 01:06:53.922
And at least come back
to talk about it.

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:56.838
Backhand's gonna cost you.

01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:59.276
Ten years, at least.

01:07:02.279 --> 01:07:03.280
He liked you.

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.328
Owen didn't really share
those kinds of things with me.

01:07:11.331 --> 01:07:12.680
But I could tell that much.

01:07:18.817 --> 01:07:20.340
At least he died like a Bentley.

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.474
[Richard] Fighting all the way.

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:28.740
I'm proud of him.

01:07:32.352 --> 01:07:33.875
I was always proud of him.

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.401
I'm sorry.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.405
If I thought
you were responsible,

01:07:41.448 --> 01:07:42.797
I'd send you out the air lock.

01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:49.282
My father used
to tell Owen and me

01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:51.241
stories about this place
when we were kids.

01:07:56.811 --> 01:07:58.117
This is where he died.

01:08:06.256 --> 01:08:07.996
I thought if I came out here,

01:08:09.215 --> 01:08:10.347
where he was...

01:08:13.872 --> 01:08:15.395
I'd feel closer to him somehow.

01:08:20.747 --> 01:08:22.707
But all it did
was cost me my brother.

01:08:27.755 --> 01:08:28.974
You're turning back?

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.282
[ominous music]

01:08:34.413 --> 01:08:35.676
[gasps]

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.116
Our oxygen levels are unstable.

01:08:42.421 --> 01:08:44.032
We can't go out any further.

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.473
Stubniski's the only one
who could fix it.

01:08:51.388 --> 01:08:52.823
[Richard] And he's gone missing.

01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:56.001
Well, then,
I guess we need to find him.

01:09:00.701 --> 01:09:01.920
If we turn back now...

01:09:03.356 --> 01:09:04.705
there's a chance to go home.

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:10.145
I don't even remember
where home is anymore.

01:09:14.279 --> 01:09:16.542
But I wouldn't mind living
a little bit longer to find out.

01:09:21.548 --> 01:09:23.506
It's business as usual
until I let you know.

01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:26.162
Okay?

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:31.470
[beeping]

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:39.087

[indistinct mumbling]

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:45.224
[Hawthorne] That boy
up in the ceiling?

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.312
[squelches. creatures chitter]

01:09:46.356 --> 01:09:47.879
[gasps]

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:49.010
[Richard] And what was that?

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.492
[Lynn] Parasites.

01:09:52.536 --> 01:09:54.799
I think Stubs is infected.

01:09:54.842 --> 01:09:56.844
And if so, low oxygen levels

01:09:56.888 --> 01:09:58.890
is the last thing
you need to worry about.

01:09:58.933 --> 01:10:01.066
Is there anything we can do?

01:10:01.109 --> 01:10:03.111
I can try to see
how far he's gone.

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.330
But the Boomers took my gun.

01:10:04.374 --> 01:10:05.984
And I'm not walking
around here unarmed.

01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:07.855
Hey, this is Stubs
we're talking about.

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:13.034
I have something for you.

01:10:24.437 --> 01:10:26.004
This is from my father.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.789
[rasps]

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:33.707
It ain't an ornament.

01:10:40.061 --> 01:10:41.237
You okay with this?

01:10:43.891 --> 01:10:45.110
I do this...

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.548
you follow Tianlong
through to white space.

Captain, looks like
we're heading

01:11:44.474 --> 01:11:46.737
into some choppy waters.

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.608
-Head in.
-[Essex terminal] Danger.

01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:50.697
The Boomers won't follow us
into the storm.

01:11:50.741 --> 01:11:52.395
Go ahead, get so close
to the bastard

01:11:52.438 --> 01:11:53.700
that you can braid
his tentacles.

01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.006
He'll lead us
right through this.

01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.487
Okay. Business as usual.
