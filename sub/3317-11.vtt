Zoe and I need to talk.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.908
What's the deal, Zoe?
We were supposed to share him,

15:07.991 --> 15:09.743
then you had to go fall in love with him.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.203
No, I didn't.

15:11.620 --> 15:13.288
(LAUGHS) So it wouldn't bother you

15:13.372 --> 15:16.959
if I got on my knee pads
and blew him, right here, right now.

15:17.042 --> 15:19.044
If he wants it, be my guest.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.963

you can just throw me away

15:34.601 --> 15:37.020
for some junior varsity mall rat?

15:37.354 --> 15:39.982
I made you, Kyle, not her.
You owe me.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.441
No, he doesn't.

you give up the coven.

22:10.998 --> 22:12.875
I can provide you with the means.

But you have to do something for me first.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.288
Yeah? Then why'd you
give my room away?

22:54.208 --> 22:55.584
You left us.

22:57.294 --> 22:59.755
And you went across town

26:53.030 --> 26:54.072

Because your daughter has become something
you will never understand, Fiona.

She's a hero.

Everyone knows it.

27:20.557 --> 27:23.560
She sacrificed her eyes
to regain the second sight.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.772
And woe to those among us
who harbor bad thoughts.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.566
I have no secrets.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.195
Then, by all means, go to her.

27:33.278 --> 27:34.404
Comfort her.

27:34.488 --> 27:38.408
Put motherly hands
upon your wounded daughter's flesh

28:01.098 --> 28:03.016

28:09.481 --> 28:10.774
I'll be back.

28:12.317 --> 28:14.236
I just need a drink.

28:15.112 --> 28:16.864

28:18.282 --> 28:19.658

28:29.168 --> 28:30.252

28:34.423 --> 28:35.507

28:43.682 --> 28:45.684

is the original gown?

29:02.910 --> 29:05.871
There's a certificate of authenticity
in there somewhere.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.294

you know.

29:12.461 --> 29:15.339
Dieter Hoffbonner designed
the gowns himself.

29:22.930 --> 29:26.016
Now, before somebody notices
that half the silver's gone missing,

29:26.391 --> 29:27.935
you give me what you promised me.

29:30.270 --> 29:31.480
Yes.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.733
The potion that will render
the voodoo queen mortal

29:34.816 --> 29:37.236
and allow you to end her life.

29:43.825 --> 29:46.578

-Shh! No.

Never speak it aloud.

30:10.811 --> 30:12.437
I have something for you.

30:15.274 --> 30:16.984
Good God, chickie, don't look at it!

30:17.067 --> 30:19.236
You'll be blinded
by the sheer craftsmanship.

30:19.570 --> 30:22.239
Um… Okay. What is it?

30:22.322 --> 30:24.074
My only possession of value.

30:24.825 --> 30:27.369
A sapphire and topaz harvester ant

30:27.744 --> 30:30.497
made for me by
Joel Arthur Rosenthal,

30:30.581 --> 30:32.124
the <i>Fabergé</i> of our time.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.209
The Harvester ant

30:34.293 --> 30:38.338
is one of the most venomous creatures
in the world, along with Fiona,

30:39.047 --> 30:41.550
and JAR, as the world
knows my dear Joel,

30:41.633 --> 30:43.302
toiled on it for months.

30:43.719 --> 30:44.761
Do you want me to wear it?

30:44.845 --> 30:46.430
You could never pull it off, darling.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.474
Only Lee Radziwill or myself
could do it justice.

30:49.558 --> 30:51.101
Now listen to me carefully…

30:52.311 --> 30:54.855
I want you to hock it
in case of emergency.

You're leaving this coven, Zoe.
And you're taking Kyle with you.

31:01.278 --> 31:03.822
I do love Kyle, Myrtle.

31:04.531 --> 31:05.532
But I'm not leaving.

31:05.616 --> 31:08.202
MYRTLE: I watched you and Kyle together
at Nan's funeral.

31:08.285 --> 31:09.536
Such a pair.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.330
So much in love.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.248

31:29.097 --> 31:31.016
Egon von Furstenberg.

31:31.850 --> 31:33.185
He dumped me,

31:34.186 --> 31:36.688
but everything worked out
all right in the end.

31:36.772 --> 31:38.148
You know why?

31:38.732 --> 31:41.985
Because he went on
to marry the divine Diane.

31:42.653 --> 31:44.196
And without Egon's support,

31:44.488 --> 31:47.282
Diane von Furstenberg
never would have created

31:47.366 --> 31:49.785
the greatest invention of the century,

31:49.868 --> 31:51.370
the wrap dress!

31:55.666 --> 31:57.292
If you stay here,

31:58.043 --> 32:00.212
your life is in grave danger.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.631
I can handle Madison.

32:02.714 --> 32:05.300
She'd slit your throat,
then sleep like a baby.

32:06.176 --> 32:07.594
I understand Madison.

32:07.678 --> 32:09.388
The depth of her cynicism.

32:09.471 --> 32:11.557
Go. You and Kyle.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.809
Run away together
and start your life over.

32:13.892 --> 32:15.310
I'm committed to this coven.

32:15.394 --> 32:17.271
So was I,
and I burned at the stake for it.

32:17.354 --> 32:18.814
What if I'm the next Supreme?

32:18.897 --> 32:20.440
All the more reason to run.

32:20.524 --> 32:22.818
If Madison doesn't end you,
Fiona will.

32:22.901 --> 32:25.737
Zoe, you have a boy that loves you.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.239
Because he's damaged goods.

32:27.865 --> 32:30.576
How dare you be so unromantic

32:30.659 --> 32:33.579
and so very, very selfish.

plucked her eyes out

32:36.206 --> 32:37.374
to protect this coven,

32:37.457 --> 32:40.752
and you have the gall to ignore
my words of warning and support?

Now,

32:43.672 --> 32:45.674

32:45.757 --> 32:47.509

you have to restore our company.

41:05.507 --> 41:06.925
Thinking you could

41:07.426 --> 41:08.927
kill me!

41:09.219 --> 41:10.345
-(GRUNTS)
-But…

41:10.429 --> 41:12.139
-Yeah, I…

41:16.059 --> 41:17.936
Your fate is sealed.

(GROANS)

41:19.438 --> 41:22.024
Oh, you stupid rube!

41:22.107 --> 41:23.942
That ain't magic.

41:24.026 --> 41:25.903
It's an antihistamine.

41:27.237 --> 41:30.741
And the only thing I'm allergic to is you.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.703
Damn you. Damn you!

41:50.886 --> 41:53.388
(EXHALES) Is she dead?

41:55.474 --> 41:56.767
She cannot die.

41:57.476 --> 41:59.895
-What?
-She's immortal.

42:00.687 --> 42:01.688
But you said…

42:01.772 --> 42:03.440
I just wanted her out of my hair.

42:04.691 --> 42:06.610
You were most likely to cooperate.

42:07.486 --> 42:09.738
Well, turds on that.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.990
What am I supposed to do
with her now?

42:12.449 --> 42:13.825
I don't know. Bury her.

42:14.409 --> 42:15.911
She'd just dig her way out!

42:17.329 --> 42:18.705
Make sure she can't.

Finally.

43:53.509 --> 43:54.635
Do you want me to do it?

43:56.595 --> 43:57.763
I'm not going.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.557
What are you talking about?

44:03.894 --> 44:04.978
I'm afraid.

44:06.522 --> 44:07.814
Of what? Me?

44:09.566 --> 44:10.651
Of me.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.027
Of me

44:12.736 --> 44:15.531
hurting you or somebody else.

44:16.198 --> 44:18.784
I have these feelings
inside that I can't…

I'm not

44:36.260 --> 44:37.678
scared of you.

44:42.975 --> 44:46.228
(SIGHS) Put the rest of your things
in my bag and-and put your shoes on.

44:46.311 --> 44:47.688
We're leaving, just like planned.

44:48.397 --> 44:49.731
I love you, Zoe…

44:51.608 --> 44:53.110
