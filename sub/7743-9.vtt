00:08.884 --> 00:10.635
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:14.640 --> 00:15.723
Can l get a hug?

00:15.808 --> 00:17.225
Sorry, fresh out.

00:17.643 --> 00:19.644
After work, come by my place,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.729
l'll see if l can't scrounge
something up for you.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.654
Feel like doing me a favor

00:29.738 --> 00:31.906
and bringing this up to
the thieves in oncology for me?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.366
Sure, no problem.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.575
Appreciate it.

00:34.910 --> 00:37.036
Pharmacy guy asked me
to bring this up to them.

00:37.121 --> 00:39.330
l'll tell you what.
You go change my catheter in six,

00:39.415 --> 00:41.666
l'll bring this up to oncology
for pharmacy guy.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.251
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.461
You gave Kelly Saturday off? Really?

00:45.546 --> 00:46.504
That's bullshit.

00:46.588 --> 00:47.672
This is gonna crush morale.

00:47.965 --> 00:52.093
l'm sorry, Jackie. l think Mr. Slater
has done wonders for morale.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.053
Your mother and l are getting a divorce.

00:56.181 --> 00:59.434
And l was starting to feel like
it might be okay again.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.602
We're okay, Kevin. lt is okay.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.438
lt is okay. We're okay.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.059
Home sweet home.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.103
Which floor is yours?

02:26.188 --> 02:27.772
All of them.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.107
Wow. Well done, you.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.153
That's right, isn't it? "Well done, you?"

02:34.238 --> 02:37.490
Absolutely. Well done, me.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.494
My head is killing me.
You don't have anything, do you?

02:43.705 --> 02:45.748
No, nothing fancy.
l'm talking about over-the-counter.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.542
Aspirin. Have any aspirin?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.551
-Yes?
-God bless you.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.058
Thanks.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.233
There's only six.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.403
What? lt's ibuprofen.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.363
l have a really big headache.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.531
Nobody needs six.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.117
Okay, fine.

03:23.245 --> 03:25.329
You're either with me or against me.
That's all l'm saying.

03:25.414 --> 03:27.164
For God's sake.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.876
Bottoms up.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.174
Come on.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.513
Truck comes out of nowhere,
bam, you're dead.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.932
What is that? Why bother getting sober?

03:45.017 --> 03:48.728
l've seen more junkies hit by shit
than sober people. That's all l'm saying.

03:48.812 --> 03:52.440
And l'm saying if l'm gonna get run over,
l'd rather be fucked up.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.733
Who's fucked up?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.610
One of his AA guys is dead.

03:55.986 --> 03:59.196
Hey, Jackie, you remember Bill.
He's fucking dead.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.198
l'm sorry to hear that.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.951
Yeah, he sponsored 50 people.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.955
They're gonna be wrecked, man.
He was their lifeline, you know?

04:08.040 --> 04:09.248
l know.

04:10.042 --> 04:12.418
You're a little shvitzy. Did you jog to work?

04:12.502 --> 04:14.045
l rode my bike.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.048
Hey, what kind of bike you got?

04:17.299 --> 04:18.758
A magic bike.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.679
Why is there champagne
in the insulin fridge?

04:25.015 --> 04:26.974
-lf you're looking for Jackie...
-l'm not.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.809
Yo, new guy, Kelly.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.479
-l need to see you in the pharmacy.
-Can it wait a sec?

04:31.647 --> 04:33.606
Did l say, "l want to see you,"
or, "Need to see you?"

04:42.950 --> 04:45.409
First things first,
l'm not accusing anyone of anything.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.535
lt doesn't sound that way.

04:46.620 --> 04:49.747
Look, l've dealt with my fair share
of strung out RNs before.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.416
And that's unfortunate,
but l got a pre-teen with a broken collarbone

04:52.501 --> 04:55.252
-waiting for a pudding cup, so...
-And you know what l got?

04:55.337 --> 04:57.463
l got enough narcotics
in here to put the whole world

04:57.547 --> 05:00.383
into a nice, warm coma for a week.
That's a fact.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.011
lt's what you signed up for.
You're the pharmacist. Step aside.

05:04.096 --> 05:06.806
l sent you up to oncology
with 40 fentanyl patches.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.307
Only 30 got there.

05:10.352 --> 05:12.144
-Fuck.
-Yeah, fuck.

05:12.688 --> 05:15.690
And l'm fucking Einstein
when it comes to squaring up my inventory.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.818
-But fentanyl, morphine, Dilaudid...
-Yeah, l know. l get it.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.946
And l don't answer to Gloria fucking
Akalitus on the schedule ones.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.615
-l answer to the state.
-No, l know.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.535
Look, l got lazy and l handed them off to...

05:27.661 --> 05:30.287
l don't wanna know. l gave them to you.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.123
Make it right.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.250
Yeah, definitely.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.003
Your fingerprints won't be
anywhere near this. l'll fix it.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.629
Yeah, you will.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.881
You have my word.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.551
All right.

05:44.219 --> 05:46.303
Dudeville. Population, three. Booyah!

05:46.388 --> 05:50.266
Yeah, well, Kelly's got some business
to take care of. So...

05:50.350 --> 05:51.726
Dudeville. Population, two.

05:51.810 --> 05:55.813
Listen, l got a lot going on,
so whatever it is, make it fast.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.984
She's pretty, right?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.778
What are you, creeping on Facebook now?

06:02.863 --> 06:04.530
And what do you care if l think she's pretty?

06:04.740 --> 06:06.866
She's gonna be my wife, Eddie.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.744
My old family failed,
so l'm starting a new one.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.414
Woke up, logged on,
started looking up old girlfriends. Boom.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.208
She's the one.
Went out with her for a year in high school.

06:17.002 --> 06:22.631
Still single. Doesn't mean she's not a catch.
Look at me. Total catch, still single.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.177
We're looking for you.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.262
Coop's wife, Facebook.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.514
l'm dying to hear about it.
We've got a girl who needs stitches.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.726
-Can't O'Hara...
-A forehead, Coop.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.228
Tiny stitches. Go be a hero. Go.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.273
-Dudeville. Population...
-Stop!

06:49.618 --> 06:51.202
Seventh floor. HR?

06:51.286 --> 06:54.080
Yeah. Just crossing my T's, dotting my l's.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.499
Good Lord, where have you been all my life?

06:56.583 --> 07:01.128
Listen, if l can find the money, would you
be interested in staying on full-time?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.632
l go where l am needed.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.342
We need you!

07:07.469 --> 07:10.346
lt was like 4:00 in the morning
and we were all tired.

07:10.555 --> 07:12.848
-The groom was getting his table dance...
-At the wedding?

07:13.016 --> 07:15.601
Who gets a table dance at their wedding?

07:15.685 --> 07:18.229
-Pay attention.
-How would l know? l don't go to weddings.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.814
l think people forget to invite me.

07:20.023 --> 07:22.441
Sorry, l was at a bachelor party.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.652
Tagged along when l shouldn't have.

07:25.487 --> 07:27.404
l do that all the time.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.657
Not bachelor parties. Never been to one.

07:29.825 --> 07:32.701
They're not so great. l mean look at me.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.037
l came all the way from Boston.

07:35.372 --> 07:39.208
l'm sitting in a club,
and Cheyenne, or whatever her name is,

07:39.292 --> 07:43.337
swings her leg and, bam,
nails me in the head with her 4" heel.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.633
Now l'm probably gonna have a scar
and l'm gonna have to wear a cast.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.136
So, believe me, you're not missing much.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.513
Yeah, l am. l'm missing a lot.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.057
There's a hole in my life.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.602
When l take a step back and look at it,
it's in the shape of a wife.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.312
l'm thinking it's gonna be this girl
from high school.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.939
l'm gonna ask her to marry me.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.024
Hold still. This might pinch a little.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.194
l know everyone around here is gonna think
l'm an idiot for moving so fast,

08:07.279 --> 08:11.532
but they don't know what it's like having
everything and nothing at the same time.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.368
Yeah. No, l get it.

08:15.704 --> 08:21.458
She must be psyched. A handsome doctor.
Jeez. Jackpot, right?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.420
So how fast are you moving?

08:24.504 --> 08:26.422
That's the best part.
She doesn't even know l'm a doctor.

08:26.673 --> 08:29.091
l haven't talked to her in 20 years.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.635
Just picked her out on Facebook
this morning. Here, wanna see a pic?

08:31.720 --> 08:35.306
Look. lmagine the Christmas card. Hot.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.602
Oh, my God. l just let you sew my face up.

08:39.728 --> 08:41.645
And you'll be glad you did. Here, look.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.731
Stop telling me to look at things.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.442
X-ray's ready for the wrist.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.818
Let's go.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.321
Come on, l worked really hard on that.
You should look.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.992
Listen, this is not what it looks like.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.995
Eddie's on point. He runs a tight ship, 1 00%.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.498
You do understand
that inventory can be manipulated, yes?

09:01.583 --> 09:05.502
-l do, but that's not...
-Did you open the bag and count them?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.922
No, man, l didn't.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.842
But if he says there were 40,
l'm sure there were 40. This is all on me.

09:11.927 --> 09:15.012
We're talking about
a fireable offense for you, Mr. Slater.

09:15.096 --> 09:18.974
No, not without a probationary period
and a urine test,

09:19.059 --> 09:21.602
both of which l'm happy to comply with.
l have nothing to hide.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.062
lt doesn't change the fact

09:23.146 --> 09:26.273
that you broke the chain of custody
during an inter-pharmacy run.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.109
On my first or second day? Come on, man.

09:29.444 --> 09:32.529
Look, if l could tell you
who l handed them off to, l would tell you.

09:32.614 --> 09:34.823
Do you recall if it was man or woman?

09:37.869 --> 09:39.328
l don't.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.538
l don't even know
if it was a nurse or a doctor.

09:41.623 --> 09:44.041
That's how big of a blur it was for me.

09:44.125 --> 09:47.044
Look, l didn't know my way around,
so l handed them off to someone.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.337
That's all l can tell you.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.926
lt might've been a guy.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.933
Well, l appreciate you coming by
and owning up to your part in the matter.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.185
Yeah, let me know
if there's anything else l can do.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.194
-You got a bag?
-No bag.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.119
You been outside? lt's nice out.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.296
Not doing so good, huh?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.006
l'm doing great.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.605
True or False. Everyone makes mistakes?

10:48.940 --> 10:51.984
Body language.
Not even acknowledging my presence.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.278
Which means she's either, A, scared of you,

10:54.362 --> 10:57.114
or B,
lulling you into a false sense of security

10:57.198 --> 10:59.825
so she can kill you and eat you for lunch.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.203
Or C,
l am saving the chit-chat for the patients.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.498
Well, hello. Nice to meet you.
l am your patient.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.461
Not even two seconds ago, l reached into
my kit and stuck myself with an Epi.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.212
What? Why is it still in your finger?

11:12.297 --> 11:13.964
-l wanted to show it to you.
-Jesus Christ.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.175
Lenny, you have epinephrine
flowing into your heart.

11:16.259 --> 11:18.886
-Hi, Boo.
-You did not. Why?

11:19.095 --> 11:22.014
What do you mean, "Why"?
lt wasn't intentional.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.850
-Okay, now l'm feeling dizzy.
-Yeah, sit.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.852
Fuck, my heart.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.730
lf you go into cardiac arrest, l will kill you.

11:29.856 --> 11:30.898
Zoey.

11:31.733 --> 11:33.734
You're gonna be fine.
We're just gonna put you on the monitor,

11:33.818 --> 11:35.652
keep an eye on you for about four hours.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.154
lf you need anything we'll be right here.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.115
Zoey, get the leads, please?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.409
-You're a very soothing nurse.
-Yes.

11:42.744 --> 11:44.119
Your hands are clammy, though.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.455
My hands are not clammy.
Your senses are all fucked up.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.332
Keep your observations to yourself.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.542
That's the Jackie l know and love.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.712
Had to see for myself. Lenny, Lenny, Lenny.

11:56.758 --> 11:58.258
-You okay?
-No.

11:59.427 --> 12:00.928
Me? Yeah, l'm fine. Why?

12:03.598 --> 12:04.598
Here you go, Jackie.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.018
lt's all yours. Thor, my kid's sick.
l think l might have caught it.

12:08.103 --> 12:09.895
Do me a favor? Can you go to Duane Reade

12:09.979 --> 12:13.607
and pick me up some antihistamines
and cough syrup, Robo DXM?

12:13.691 --> 12:15.317
Careful with the DXM.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.862
l double-dosed for a nasty cough,
started to hear angels.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.157
-Anything else?
-New feet.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.731
Hey, is it cool with you
if l take off for a little bit?

12:54.816 --> 12:56.984
-Yeah, sure, let's all take off.
-No, seriously.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.695
l wanna hit Bill's memorial service.
Only about an hour.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.864
Sam, it's not a good time to be off the floor.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.491
You know what? Fine, go.
Do me a favor? Go to Duane Reade,

13:04.576 --> 13:07.411
pick me up some NoDoz?
The newsstand is out of it.

13:07.495 --> 13:09.538
l was up all night with a sick kid.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.706
Sure.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.334
Hot, right?

13:14.669 --> 13:16.420
Make good-looking kids, don't you think?

13:16.504 --> 13:20.090
You might want to let her accept your friend
request before you start naming them.

13:20.175 --> 13:23.385
Stop! Tell me you didn't buy a Rolex.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.012
Dude, l'm a doctor.

13:25.096 --> 13:28.515
Shouldn't you be saving your money
for an engagement ring?

13:28.683 --> 13:30.434
That's what l'm gonna use
my fantasy football money for.

13:30.518 --> 13:33.020
Cooper Duper's still on top, right?

13:33.188 --> 13:35.105
Yes, but wow.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.109
Paying for an engagement ring
with money you make from fantasy football.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.196
-Doesn't get much straighter than that.
-No, it doesn't.

13:42.572 --> 13:45.657
Oh, my God,
she just accepted my friend request.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.784
lt is so on.

13:49.204 --> 13:51.413
An hour on Craigslist, really?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.123
Are you sure you wanna sell it?

13:53.208 --> 13:55.167
lt's a great pinball machine,
but she offered me cash.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.461
And nobody really plays anymore.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.963
The bells bother Grace.
l feel like times are tight.

14:00.048 --> 14:04.760
You know? So I'll take it out to her in
Montauk and grab a bite and head back.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.554
Montauk? Well, that's kind of a haul.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.098
Maybe we should call Tunie,
see if she can watch the girls.

14:10.225 --> 14:12.392
All right. Let me get into it, okay?

14:13.603 --> 14:16.146
-Love you.
-All right. Love you back.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.237
Father and son, dislocated shoulders.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.364
A sale or something?
A little two-for-one? Or...

14:25.448 --> 14:27.950
Yeah, you're about as funny
as a box of orphans.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.160
-l try.
-Yeah? Well, try harder.

14:30.245 --> 14:31.787
-Dad.
-What?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.747
She comes in, makes a stupid crack.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.291
Gentlemen, we have two options.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.960
The first is to sedate you both,

14:38.586 --> 14:39.628
put the shoulders back in place,

14:39.712 --> 14:41.838
in which case you'll stay here
until the sedative wears off.

14:41.923 --> 14:44.424
Yeah, no. We're not sticking around.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.760
l gotta meet my parole officer at 5:00.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.846
All right, a second option
is to give you both a local, say, Novocain.

14:49.931 --> 14:52.140
So stop talking and do it.

14:52.267 --> 14:53.350
You could at least let her finish.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.436
-Will you shut the fuck up, huh?
-Whoa. Watch yourself.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.488
He just got out of prison.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.532
He's got a mouth on him, l know.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.659
-ls that your father?
-Father-in-law.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.246
We were living in the house while
he was away, taking care of Frankie's mom.

15:14.330 --> 15:18.292
Came back to get our flat screen
and he lost his shit on Frankie.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.878
Let's get you guys out of here.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.966
What are you telling her out there, huh?

15:26.050 --> 15:28.051
You're talking about the fucking TV again?

15:28.136 --> 15:31.305
-l bought it so l could watch the Jets.
-lt was a gift.

15:31.431 --> 15:34.266
-You're a fucking lndian giver.
-Let's get Kelly in here.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.977
Ortho's on its way.
Try not to break anything else.

15:43.109 --> 15:46.820
Makes me want to call my own father
and tell him l love him.

15:46.988 --> 15:51.366
By which, l mean, ask him what he's reading
and find out how the dogs are.

15:52.994 --> 15:55.329
Listen, l'm sorry. l just...

15:56.205 --> 15:59.666
l know he seems bad,
but he's just from a different generation.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.501
Really? l mean he looks about 50.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.004
-No, you know what l mean.
-No, l'm afraid l don't.

16:04.088 --> 16:07.841
Please, anything that you could do
to speed this up would be amazing.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.427
lf he misses his parole officer,
they'll send him back.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.804
Look, All Saints will call whoever
and tell them he's in the hospital.

16:12.889 --> 16:13.889
lt happens every day.

16:13.973 --> 16:17.017
He broke my nose once
and l'm not even related.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.479
Can we please just try and not piss him off?

16:21.022 --> 16:22.522
Yeah, got it.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.868
See? Your heart rate went up.

16:34.952 --> 16:35.994
So?

16:38.915 --> 16:40.916
Wait. What are you doing?

16:42.210 --> 16:43.710
Lie detector.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.047
Have at it, Barkow.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.799
l'm an open book.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.968
-Are you interested in seeing other people?
-No.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.225
-Good answer.
-Yeah.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.978
Do you have, like, crazy credit card debt
or an ex-wife buried in your yard

17:02.063 --> 17:03.772
or anything weird
that you haven't told me about?

17:03.856 --> 17:06.650
Nope. l don't even like to carry a balance.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.575
Who did you vote for
in the last presidential election?

17:18.079 --> 17:21.790
-Oh, my God, are you...
-No. No. No. l just... lt's not what you think.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.000
l just can't even remember who ran.

17:24.085 --> 17:25.836
-Did you even vote?
-l tried to, but then l was...

17:25.920 --> 17:27.546
Everything okay?

17:27.755 --> 17:31.049
Yeah, we're good,
bordering on awesome at this point.

17:31.134 --> 17:34.594
Ortho's got your father and son.
The old man's a prick.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.096
You done?

17:42.603 --> 17:43.937
Oh, my God.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.524
You have a crush on Jackie.

17:47.608 --> 17:50.026
l do not!

17:50.611 --> 17:51.611
No.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.073
She just scares me a little.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.661
Okay, a lot.
Kinda like walking into a buzz saw.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.164
-l think she's inspiring.
-She is.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.293
But sometimes, she inspires fear.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.088
l know.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.050
Four messages already.
And we have the same favorite book.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.430
Yeah. l hate to kill the vibe,
but lots of people liked The Kite Runner.

18:19.307 --> 18:22.809
l asked her out. She said, "Yes."

18:22.977 --> 18:25.645
Well, it's a good idea
to take her out before you marry her.

18:25.730 --> 18:29.107
-l went out with her for a year.
-When you were 1 6.

18:29.442 --> 18:33.236
Coop, just don't get your hopes up, okay?

18:34.363 --> 18:37.073
l finally get a glimmer of hope,
and everyone keeps messing with it.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.326
Quit messing with my glimmer. Whoa.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.120
What? What's up?

18:42.205 --> 18:44.122
A patient wants to be my friend.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.166
Wow. That's weird.

18:47.543 --> 18:48.668
Very.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.297
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.841
Man, l thought l missed you.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.844
l wanted to accept your friend request
in person.

18:57.929 --> 18:59.179
l accept.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.973
Oh, my God.
l sent that, like, two minutes ago.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.934
-l move fast.
-l know.

19:04.018 --> 19:06.186
And if it freaks people out, so what?

19:07.063 --> 19:10.398
And, l'm sorry that l didn't look
when you asked me to.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.359
That was really rude of me.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.903
What you did was amazing, so thanks.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.364
-lt's a gift.
-What can l say?

19:17.573 --> 19:20.492
l'm looking forward to your Christmas card.

19:23.371 --> 19:26.122
-Hey, thanks for being my friend.
-Yeah.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.001
Thanks for letting me go.
Here's your NoDoz.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.503
No problem.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.380
So Lenny stuck himself with an Epi.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.591
-Bet that was a rush.
-Yeah, l bet it was.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.135
Do me a favor? Can you check on
O'Hara's dislocated shoulders?

19:39.554 --> 19:41.012
-Sure.
-Watch out, man.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.305
That guy's a racist.

19:43.015 --> 19:45.225
-You know what? l'll do it.
-Yeah?

19:45.309 --> 19:48.228
Yeah. Thanks anyway. My patient.
l'll handle it.

19:48.354 --> 19:52.983
l wasn't lying. l do like your mom,
but going over there freaks me out.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.736
-She's a hoarder, Boo.
-She's not a hoarder. She's an enthusiast.

19:58.155 --> 20:00.407
Less than an hour left, Lenny.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.993
Do you have any more Epis?

20:03.077 --> 20:04.828
Yeah, check my kit.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.539
Because you have to like my mom.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.291
Got it. Thanks.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.918
l do like your mom.

20:12.169 --> 20:14.546
But you have to admit,
she looks at me kinda weird.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.339
That's just how her face is!

20:17.508 --> 20:19.634
That doesn't even make sense.

20:32.273 --> 20:33.690
l did a bad thing and l need your help.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.400
How bad?

20:35.693 --> 20:37.527
l stuck Anthony Murphy with an Epi.

20:38.029 --> 20:41.031
He thought it was another Novocain.
He'll be fine. We just can't let him leave.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.659
As a private citizen, l'm delighted.

20:45.202 --> 20:47.996
As a medical professional,
l'm absolutely appalled.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.915
Well done and shame on you.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.628
Shall we?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.885
-ls he gonna be okay?
-What the fuck is happening to me?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.012
You're on the verge of a heart attack,
Mr. Murphy.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.514
ls there a history of heart disease
in the family, do you know?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.516
He doesn't know fuck all.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.686
Go outside and get a car. Wait for me.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.897
Go in my wallet, get my parole officer's card.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.317
Tell him l'm on my way. l gotta go.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.277
lf you leave, there's an enormous possibility

21:19.362 --> 21:21.404
that you will go into cardiac arrest
and you will die.

21:21.489 --> 21:25.492
Here. Let me call him. There's nothing better
than a call from the ER. Trust me.

21:28.412 --> 21:29.496
Fuck.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.165
All right.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.379
She looks nice.

21:39.924 --> 21:41.299
You gonna take it slow like me and Zoey?

21:41.384 --> 21:44.594
No, taking it fast like a ninja.

21:45.846 --> 21:48.765
l wanna be more than the guy with the tics
whose moms got divorced.

21:48.849 --> 21:50.433
Not a lot to ask.

21:50.518 --> 21:52.602
She's my ticket to more, Lenny.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.937
Right on.

21:55.940 --> 21:58.233
Check out the crush on Zoey.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.694
-l know.
-Stop.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.238
-All day, every time she walks in.
-Stop.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.824
Time's up. Coop'll unhook you.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.579
Dude, that's like having a boner
on the diving board.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.206
Pretty much.

22:17.378 --> 22:20.380
Here's to the illegal detention of a bully

22:21.173 --> 22:24.676
and the closing of my townhouse.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.890
Did you call his parole officer?

22:31.642 --> 22:32.976
No. None for me, thanks.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.894
What? You're joking.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.731
No, l'm staying away from the hard stuff.

22:38.399 --> 22:41.234
But this is the soft, lovely, bubbly stuff.
Come on.

22:43.029 --> 22:48.533
l've gone 37 hours with no Percocet,
no Vicodin, no oxy.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.747
And you're miserable.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.710
Thirty-seven hours, 37 hours.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.756
How the fuck am l gonna make it to 38?

23:03.758 --> 23:04.966
Anything l can do?

23:06.135 --> 23:07.177
No.

23:09.096 --> 23:11.389
You want me to stick around
so you're not drinking by yourself?

23:11.474 --> 23:14.184
Please, l do it all the time. Sport of kings.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.228
Go, leave me to my bubbly.

23:21.275 --> 23:24.736
Jacks, l can get my car
to take you home if you'd like.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.738
No, thanks. l'm good.

23:32.203 --> 23:33.411
Cheers.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.292
Jackie Peyton. Yeah. Yeah, l can hold.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.797
-Do you mind? l'm sorry. My cell died.
-No.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.049
So tell me about Kelly.

23:46.801 --> 23:47.842
l don't know, what's to tell?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.636
Yeah. Hi, Tunie.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.554
Listen, l know it's very last minute,

23:51.639 --> 23:54.474
but l'm wondering
if you can keep the girls tonight.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.936
Kev's still in Montauk
and l gotta work a double.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.732
Yeah? Great. Okay, thanks. Bye.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.618
You're not working a double.

24:13.702 --> 24:14.994
No.

24:15.663 --> 24:19.958
l need a night alone. No husband, no kids,
no nothing. Just, you know,

24:20.292 --> 24:22.168
a cigarette and a hot bath.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.003
You want a ride?

24:25.506 --> 24:27.006
No, l'm good.

24:29.176 --> 24:32.011
For the record, l'm clean for a week.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.015
Hey, how's that going?

24:40.729 --> 24:42.647
l miss the rush, Eddie.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.817
l really miss it.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.261
Are you fucking nuts?

25:13.345 --> 25:15.013
Bet your ass l am.
