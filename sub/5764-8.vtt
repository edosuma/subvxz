Melinda:

00:04.763 --> 00:06.265
I've been stuck here
for 10 minutes.

00:06.332 --> 00:08.233
Jim: gridlock

00:08.301 --> 00:09.901
Yeah, it's a building
renovation,

00:09.969 --> 00:11.870
And the square's
a parking lot.

00:11.938 --> 00:13.939
Hey, i've got a few hours
before my shift.

00:14.006 --> 00:15.974

00:21.848 --> 00:24.516
Oh, wait. never mind.

00:24.584 --> 00:26.485
I'm not the best anymore?

You are the best.

00:38.265 --> 00:40.366
Uh-oh.

Oh, god, not right now.

00:43.036 --> 00:44.703
Stop!
ooh.

00:47.006 --> 00:48.540
Oh, boy.

00:48.608 --> 00:50.008
Whoa. i need your help.

00:50.076 --> 00:51.944
Uh, sorry.

00:52.011 --> 00:55.280
I-i'm still not used
to this whole, uh, ghost thing.

00:55.348 --> 00:57.983
Uh, ok. well,
i have to pick up my kid
from soccer, so...

00:58.051 --> 00:59.518
You know, i need you
to help me.

00:59.586 --> 01:01.019
I've been in there
for 2 days,

01:01.087 --> 01:02.521
And none of the workers
have noticed me.

01:02.589 --> 01:03.689
Your body?

01:03.756 --> 01:06.792
In that building over there,
facedown in the dirt.

01:06.859 --> 01:09.328
I don't want my loved ones
to see me like that. please.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.462
Don't let me rot.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.965
[sighs] let me
call my husband.

01:13.032 --> 01:15.534
Ok. come on. come on.
come on. come on. come on.

01:17.036 --> 01:17.970
Hey...

01:18.037 --> 01:19.972
Go. go. see?
it's down there.

01:20.039 --> 01:22.374
Go! go! go! go! go!
come on.

01:26.613 --> 01:27.546
[gasps] ohh.

01:27.614 --> 01:29.047
Yeah, i-i'm down there.

01:34.621 --> 01:37.189
All i'm asking for
is my dignity.

01:42.729 --> 01:44.730

01:51.904 --> 01:54.006
A little further in.

02:06.986 --> 02:09.520
Do you mind, uh,
calling the police?

02:10.990 --> 02:13.058
Watch the quarter.

02:14.794 --> 02:18.063
Well, how can we watch it
if you're hiding it?

02:18.131 --> 02:19.731
You can't, because
it's disappeared.

02:19.799 --> 02:22.401
How'd you do that?!
that was so cool.

02:22.468 --> 02:23.402
It's magic.

02:23.469 --> 02:24.569
Real magic?

02:24.637 --> 02:27.072
A magician never tells.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.373
Hey, gus, i wanna go
play at your house.

02:28.441 --> 02:29.808
I thought you were
coming to my house.

02:29.876 --> 02:31.777
I wanna see
some more magic.

02:31.844 --> 02:33.945
I can do stuff, too,
things you can't.

02:34.013 --> 02:35.313
Yeah, right.
do another one.

02:35.381 --> 02:36.948
Hey, uh, guys,
sorry i'm late.

02:37.016 --> 02:37.949
What's goin' on?

02:38.017 --> 02:38.950
Gus is magic.

02:39.018 --> 02:40.085
Not real magic.

02:40.153 --> 02:41.953
Uh, let's talk about it
in the car, huh?

02:42.021 --> 02:44.256
Go buckle up.
doors are open.

02:45.525 --> 02:46.792
How you doin'?

02:46.859 --> 02:47.959
What's goin' on?

02:48.027 --> 02:49.161
I wanna go home.

02:49.228 --> 02:50.228
All right.

02:53.132 --> 02:54.599
[siren]

02:54.667 --> 02:57.202
Don't forget
to have the coroner
sign the report, ok?

02:57.270 --> 02:59.905
Eli: oh,
detective blair, hi.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.940
And how'd you find
this one?

03:02.008 --> 03:04.242
Oh, it's, uh,
simple, really.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.243
Um...

03:05.311 --> 03:08.413
Yeah. yeah, because,
uh, he--he...

03:08.481 --> 03:09.448
Dropped his cellphone,

03:09.515 --> 03:12.117
And then he went to go
and retrieve it.

03:12.185 --> 03:13.318
And i saw shoes.

03:13.386 --> 03:14.319
Uh-huh.

03:14.387 --> 03:16.321
Why is it
everywhere you go,

03:16.389 --> 03:18.490
You seem to keep
finding bodies?

03:18.558 --> 03:20.258
Because people
keep dying.

03:20.326 --> 03:21.626
Do--do you know
who he is?

03:21.694 --> 03:24.429
Uh, his i.d.
was in his wallet.

03:24.497 --> 03:25.831
Name's kirk jansen.

03:25.898 --> 03:27.432
His wife is
on her way now.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.202
Now it gets
interesting.

03:30.269 --> 03:31.503
What does
that mean?

03:31.571 --> 03:33.839
Means we called her.

03:34.874 --> 03:36.108
Woman: where is he?

03:36.175 --> 03:37.909
Where's my husband?

03:39.212 --> 03:40.712
Oh, my god.

03:40.780 --> 03:41.813
Kirk, no!

03:41.881 --> 03:44.282
Wow. she's really
convincing.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.284
Don't go anywhere,
either of you.

03:46.352 --> 03:48.920
I'll take it from here.
oh, my god! kirk!

03:48.988 --> 03:50.722
No! no!

03:50.790 --> 03:51.723
No!

03:51.791 --> 03:53.458
Look, i know how
hard it is to watch

03:53.526 --> 03:54.626
Someone you love
grieve like this.

03:54.727 --> 03:56.495
You know,
we can help you
talk to her

03:56.562 --> 03:58.463
If you want
before you go
into the light.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.398
Oh, uh-uh. no, no, no.
i'm not going anywhere.

04:00.466 --> 04:03.268
Well, you need
to let go and let
your wife mourn you.

04:03.336 --> 04:04.636
Rita, mourn?

04:04.704 --> 04:06.872
Don't count on it.
those tears are an act.

04:06.939 --> 04:09.074
That bitch killed me.

04:15.381 --> 04:17.616
Child, whispering:
can you see us?

04:17.617 --> 04:23.617
Sync by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com

04:59.048 --> 05:00.048
Ready?

05:00.116 --> 05:02.084
[resumes humming] nuh!

05:02.152 --> 05:03.986
[gasps] where is it?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.087
Mm.

05:05.155 --> 05:06.088
Ta-da!

05:06.156 --> 05:08.323
Cool. can i do it?

05:08.391 --> 05:11.560
Yeah, but you're gonna
have to practice a lot, ok?

05:11.628 --> 05:13.629
Uh-huh!

05:13.696 --> 05:15.631
There's more
where that came from.

05:15.698 --> 05:17.065
Thanks, daddy.

05:17.133 --> 05:18.233
You're welcome.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.234
See ya.
this is awesome!

05:19.302 --> 05:21.236
Since when
is he into magic?

05:21.304 --> 05:24.640
Oh, ever since little gus
started showing him some tricks.

05:24.707 --> 05:27.109
I've never seen him
look so left out.

05:27.177 --> 05:28.343
That nearly killed me.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.778
Aww. well,
you know what?

05:29.846 --> 05:31.581
It's good for him
to have a hobby
besides ghosts.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.549
Especially since he's
started telling his friends

05:33.617 --> 05:34.817
That he can do things,

05:34.885 --> 05:36.152
Um, other people can't.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.389
Wait. did he tell them
about the ghosts?

05:39.456 --> 05:41.190
No. no, i stopped him
before he could finish,

05:41.258 --> 05:43.960
And then i took him out to buy
this magic kit to distract him.

05:44.028 --> 05:45.061
Genius.
thank you.

05:45.129 --> 05:46.929
Oh. hey, your body came
into the morgue today.

05:46.997 --> 05:49.232
They're gonna try to get to it
tonight for the autopsy.

05:49.299 --> 05:50.566
Please stop calling it
"my body."

05:51.134 --> 05:53.569
Look, do you really think
his wife murdered him?

05:53.637 --> 05:54.703
That's what he said.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.071
And if he's telling
the truth,

05:56.139 --> 05:57.873
I'm never gonna
get him into the light.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.441
It's hard to say,
"i forgive you,"

05:59.509 --> 06:00.576
After your spouse
whacks you.

06:00.644 --> 06:03.579
Yeah. should you leave
this one to the police?

06:03.647 --> 06:04.914
I always do.

06:04.981 --> 06:07.983
But i have to get him
into the light.

06:08.051 --> 06:09.251
All right.

06:09.319 --> 06:10.653
Let's say
she really is guilty.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.088
But what if the police
can't solve the crime

06:13.156 --> 06:16.225
And you are the only one
who knows the truth?

06:17.294 --> 06:18.294
Scrub brush.

06:20.564 --> 06:21.564
Thank you.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.600
Yeah, of course i know
rita and kirk jansen.

06:24.668 --> 06:27.836
They're like the power
couple of grandview
real estate.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.171
They're married.
they're successful.

06:29.239 --> 06:30.506
They're witty.
they're charming.

06:30.574 --> 06:31.907
They get all
the best listings.

06:31.975 --> 06:34.009
Sound like you're the president
of their fan club.

06:34.077 --> 06:35.177
Oh, are you kidding me?

06:35.245 --> 06:36.745
I pretty much hate them.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.448
Kirk beat me out
for the golden key
2 years ago.

06:39.516 --> 06:41.550
Golden key?
yeah.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.186
It's a sales award from
the realty association,

06:44.254 --> 06:46.188
And he doubled
his listings after that.

06:46.256 --> 06:50.059
And you wanna know why?
because...

06:50.126 --> 06:51.627
He's a genius.

06:51.695 --> 06:53.128
Listen to this.

06:53.196 --> 06:55.631
"the kitchen
will make you want
to kick off your shoes,

06:55.699 --> 06:57.533
"pour a glass
of ice cold prosecco

06:57.601 --> 06:59.868
"from the stainless
steel fridge while
sinatra croons

06:59.936 --> 07:03.238
On the room-to-room
digital sound system."

07:03.306 --> 07:04.773
I mean, it's poetry.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.709
Ok. so then if they were
such a perfect couple,

07:06.776 --> 07:09.311
Then how come he said that
she wanted to murder him?

07:09.379 --> 07:11.413
I mean, something
obviously went sour
at some point.

07:11.481 --> 07:12.982
Wait. didn't we
have a rule

07:13.049 --> 07:15.217
Where we let the police figure
out who-dunnits when they can?

07:15.285 --> 07:17.019
Yeah, but if we're gonna
cross this ghost over,

07:17.087 --> 07:18.454
We need to figure out
the why-dunnit,

07:18.521 --> 07:19.688
For lack
of a better word.

07:19.756 --> 07:21.624
Give me a shout
when you do.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.726
So you said that your wife
wanted to murder you,

07:23.793 --> 07:25.928
And now you don't know why?

07:25.996 --> 07:27.162
He's here.

07:27.230 --> 07:28.564
Oh. um...

07:28.632 --> 07:29.565
Hi, kirk.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.700
I'm really
sorry about...

07:31.768 --> 07:32.701
You know. yeah.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.236
It's simple.
she hated me.

07:34.304 --> 07:35.904
Lots of married couples
hate each other.

07:35.972 --> 07:37.139
How'd she do it, anyway?

07:37.207 --> 07:38.240
Ah, you don't
wanna know.

07:38.341 --> 07:40.442
Uh, if we're gonna help you,
we have to know.

07:40.510 --> 07:42.444
Well, trust me.
it was horrible.

07:42.512 --> 07:44.480
All i can say
is everything
about rita is toxic.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.248
I wouldn't
put it past her

07:46.316 --> 07:47.249
If she poisoned me.

07:47.317 --> 07:48.784
I--you know, i would
have walked barefoot

07:48.852 --> 07:50.119
Over burning, broken
glass for her.

07:50.186 --> 07:51.954
I did
everything i could

07:52.022 --> 07:53.822
To make her happy.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.358
Obviously not happy enough.

08:05.802 --> 08:07.703
Who's there?

08:09.873 --> 08:12.007
Kirk?

08:12.075 --> 08:14.309
[gasping]

08:25.622 --> 08:27.056
That's how she
killed me.

08:29.693 --> 08:31.427
Since you asked.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.567
Anaphylactic shock.

08:38.635 --> 08:39.568
He died from allergies?

08:39.635 --> 08:40.568
It can happen.

08:40.636 --> 08:41.736
I mean, the symptoms
you described

08:41.804 --> 08:43.138
Sounded like
a severe reaction.

08:43.206 --> 08:46.741
Ok, was it from
something he touched,
inhaled, or ate?

08:46.809 --> 08:48.310
I don't know.
we'll have to wait

08:48.377 --> 08:49.345
For the tox screen
to come back, but, uh,

08:50.413 --> 08:51.280
The police think
he was poisoned.

08:51.247 --> 08:52.314
Yeah, so does the ghost.

08:52.382 --> 08:54.049
I mean, could his wife
have deliberately

08:54.117 --> 08:56.285
Exposed him to something
that he was allergic to?

08:56.352 --> 08:58.020
Absolutely,
but did she drag him

08:58.088 --> 09:00.055
Down to that basement
by herself?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.357
Actually, i overheard
the police saying

09:01.424 --> 09:03.125
That he crawled
in there on his own.

09:03.193 --> 09:04.126
In a $2,000 suit?

09:04.194 --> 09:05.528
He was a realtor,
you know.

09:05.595 --> 09:07.363
Maybe the building was
one of his listings,

09:07.430 --> 09:09.665
Or maybe
he was there doing
some sort of inspection.

09:09.733 --> 09:11.500
Whatever it is,
he's not coughing it up.

09:11.568 --> 09:12.868
So to speak.

09:12.936 --> 09:14.837
[p.a.] dr. travis,
you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

09:14.905 --> 09:15.905
Eli?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.139
No, delia.
i wanna see

09:17.207 --> 09:19.642
If she can get me
the skinny on that
building. bye.

09:19.709 --> 09:20.643
Bye.

09:20.710 --> 09:21.977
Watch the magic ball.

09:22.045 --> 09:23.879
Gus: i think
i've seen this one.

09:23.947 --> 09:26.081
Well, it's a lovely
classic brownstone,

09:26.149 --> 09:28.817
And it was sold twice
within the past few months.

09:28.885 --> 09:29.951
So somebody flipped it?

09:30.019 --> 09:32.120
Well, if they did,
they weren't very smart,

09:32.188 --> 09:33.755
Because they took
a huge loss.

09:33.823 --> 09:36.024
Well, did either
represent the buyer
or seller?

09:36.092 --> 09:37.993
Mm-mmm. both transactions
were private.

09:38.061 --> 09:41.863
It was sold by some company
named brokerage investments,

09:41.931 --> 09:45.534
And before that, it was
purchased by arcmod limited.

09:45.601 --> 09:49.104
I wonder if rita or kirk
have anything to do
with those companies.

09:49.172 --> 09:51.840
Well, according to the chain
of title, they didn't,

09:51.908 --> 09:55.043
But, you know, it's not
really hard to hide
those kind of things.

09:55.111 --> 09:56.678
Abracadabra.
[snaps photo]

09:56.746 --> 09:57.712
There's an open house
tomorrow,

09:57.780 --> 09:59.281
A big property
that rita's listing.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.383
I'm sure people from her work
are gonna be there.

10:01.451 --> 10:02.417
I could go,
ask some questions,

10:02.485 --> 10:03.718
[snaps photo]
see what they know.

10:03.786 --> 10:05.353
Oh.
gus: let me guess.
the ball's disappeared,

10:05.421 --> 10:07.589
And now it's
in your pocket.

10:08.791 --> 10:10.592
That one's easy.

10:10.660 --> 10:12.394
You know, it still
just doesn't explain

10:12.462 --> 10:14.129
What kirk was doing
crawling around
in that basement.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.331
That building
wasn't even for sale,

10:16.399 --> 10:17.365
So he wouldn't have
had any interest in it.

10:17.433 --> 10:19.868
Hey, check this out.

10:19.936 --> 10:21.570
Cool.

10:21.637 --> 10:23.905
Bet you can't do this.

10:30.213 --> 10:33.215
Abracadabra.

10:35.418 --> 10:36.351
Do that again.

10:36.419 --> 10:38.653
Wow. he is good.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.255
Really good.

10:40.323 --> 10:41.323
Gus:
how'd you do that?

10:41.390 --> 10:43.058
A magician
never tells.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.759
Remember?

10:49.165 --> 10:50.465
Well, that's weird.

10:50.533 --> 10:51.466
Magic is weird.

10:51.534 --> 10:52.934
No, no, no.
not that.

10:53.002 --> 10:55.971
My camera. how did
these photographs
get here?

11:00.143 --> 11:03.145
Because you just took them.

11:03.212 --> 11:06.248
No. sorry.
i--i just saw rita
kissing another guy.

11:06.315 --> 11:08.316
Oh, a guy that
wasn't kirk?

11:08.384 --> 11:11.453
Yeah. um, i guess
there's a lot more
to the story

11:11.521 --> 11:13.121
Than the ghost
is letting on.

11:13.189 --> 11:14.122
I guess.

11:14.190 --> 11:16.124
Oh, yeah.
you bet there is.

11:16.192 --> 11:17.626
Rita was
cheating on you?

11:17.693 --> 11:20.128
She's also plotting
with that hottie
on how they can

11:20.196 --> 11:22.397
Get their hands
on my $2 million
life insurance policy.

11:22.465 --> 11:23.932
That's why she killed me.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.968
You cannot let her
get away with this.

11:39.704 --> 11:42.005
Oh. thank you.

11:42.073 --> 11:45.109
Mmm. hey...

11:45.176 --> 11:47.644
Who was that guy
in the photo?

11:47.712 --> 11:49.113
You know,
the one's kirk's wife's

11:49.180 --> 11:51.014
Gonna be
spending all her
insurance money on.

11:51.082 --> 11:52.316
I have no idea.

11:52.384 --> 11:53.917
The pictures
that i saw vanished.

11:53.985 --> 11:55.285
Otherwise,
delia would have known.

11:55.353 --> 11:56.653
They all know each other.

11:56.721 --> 11:58.555
Maybe mr. hottie
runs in that circle.

11:58.623 --> 12:00.491
I'm sorry. uh...

12:00.558 --> 12:01.492
Mr. hottie?

12:01.559 --> 12:02.826
Heh. i only call him that

12:02.894 --> 12:04.161
Because he has
a certain appeal.

12:04.229 --> 12:07.464
Wow. that's how it goes,
huh? all right.

12:07.532 --> 12:09.400
Yeah, i guess
you couldn't ask
his wife, uh,

12:09.467 --> 12:11.034
"who's this guy you're
makin' out with?" right?

12:11.069 --> 12:13.103
Uh, no, not this time.

12:13.171 --> 12:14.772
No. melinda,
i don't think this is

12:14.839 --> 12:17.374
The kind of woman
you're gonna wanna
back into a corner.

12:17.442 --> 12:21.111
If she did it,
which i don't know if she did.

12:21.179 --> 12:22.846
Really? why?
well, first of all,

12:22.914 --> 12:24.915
Kirk isn't really sure
how he died.

12:24.983 --> 12:27.451
Wait. his bout with
anaphylactic shock's
not specific enough?

12:27.485 --> 12:28.452
If that's what killed him.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.720
Oh, no,
i checked my e-mail.

12:29.788 --> 12:30.921
It did.
i'm sure of it.

12:30.989 --> 12:32.756
They haven't exactly
found the allergen yet,

12:32.824 --> 12:33.924
But they're
gonna find out.

12:33.992 --> 12:35.426
Ok, so then what?

12:35.493 --> 12:36.894
Well, the police'll
check his medical
history, right,

12:36.961 --> 12:39.129
And then they'll
go and see if she knew
about the allergy

12:39.197 --> 12:40.597
And then
purposely exposed him
to the substance.

12:40.665 --> 12:42.132
You know,
i have to admit it.

12:42.200 --> 12:43.867
Maybe he didn't know
how she did it,

12:43.935 --> 12:45.803
But why is he
so sure that she did?

12:45.870 --> 12:47.438
'cause of the affair.

12:47.505 --> 12:49.440
Which he didn't
tell me about,

12:49.507 --> 12:52.075
Which is weird,
because i think he knew.

12:52.143 --> 12:54.645
Hmm. wait.
don't you get all your
visions through him?

12:54.712 --> 12:55.913
Not necessarily.

12:55.980 --> 12:58.081
Sometimes i can see things
that ghosts don't intend,

12:58.149 --> 12:59.783
But he wasn't
surprised by the photos.

12:59.851 --> 13:02.319
He was just angry and smug,
like he was kind of happy

13:02.387 --> 13:03.821
That all the details
were coming out.

13:03.888 --> 13:07.090
Yeah, the details
that'll nail her,
right? justice.

13:07.158 --> 13:08.091
Yeah, or revenge.

13:08.159 --> 13:10.060
Is this aiden's?

13:10.128 --> 13:11.061
Yeah, it is.

13:11.129 --> 13:13.263
This is part
of his magic kit.

13:13.331 --> 13:14.565
This is
his on-the-go,

13:14.632 --> 13:15.899
Traveling
bag of tricks.

13:15.967 --> 13:18.068
You know, he--he was
doing a trick today

13:18.136 --> 13:21.004
Where he moved the ball
from one hand to the other,

13:21.072 --> 13:22.172
And you were helping
him with that, right?

13:22.240 --> 13:23.307
Did you--
did you teach him that?

13:23.374 --> 13:24.308
No.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.677
Well, then where
did he learn it?

13:26.744 --> 13:28.879
Ah, maybe his friends
or tv or...

13:30.081 --> 13:31.515
The book has
illustrations.

13:33.017 --> 13:35.419
You think he got
some ghostly help?

13:35.487 --> 13:37.421
It's possible.

13:37.489 --> 13:38.989
Ah, speaking of help,
hold on.

13:39.057 --> 13:40.657
No, no, no.
it's fine. relax.

13:57.876 --> 13:59.977
[gasps] oh, my god.

14:00.044 --> 14:01.411
Oh, my god.

14:01.479 --> 14:03.080
Honey, what is it?
eww.

14:03.147 --> 14:04.481
Wh-what--
there were these--

14:10.421 --> 14:11.688
I sw--i swear i...

14:11.756 --> 14:13.023
I know. i know.

14:13.091 --> 14:14.024
Delia: intestines?

14:14.092 --> 14:15.559
What the hell
do those mean?

14:15.627 --> 14:17.628
That he hates her guts.
funny.

14:17.695 --> 14:20.497
I don't understand.
i mean, usually
when i get a vision,

14:20.565 --> 14:22.833
It's something
that the ghost
wants me to feel.

14:22.901 --> 14:24.701
Yeah, or torture you with.

14:24.769 --> 14:26.403
Well,
there's always that.
but you know what?

14:26.471 --> 14:28.305
I have done everything
that this ghost asked me.

14:28.373 --> 14:30.240
I mean, i've even been
helping with the police.

14:30.308 --> 14:31.708
How are you doing that?
through jim.

14:31.776 --> 14:33.977
You know, i don't
think the coroner
would have even thought

14:34.045 --> 14:35.879
To look for allergens if
jim hadn't mentioned it.

14:35.947 --> 14:37.915
Ok, about that,
didn't you say

14:37.982 --> 14:39.716
That kirk died
from some exposure to mold?

14:39.784 --> 14:42.185
Yeah. they just
found out he's allergic
to a certain strain.

14:42.253 --> 14:44.221
Ok, well, that's interesting,

14:44.289 --> 14:47.658
Because this building had mold.
it's in the report.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.893
You know the inspections
that you get

14:49.961 --> 14:52.696
Every time that you're
gonna buy a house?
mm-hmm.

14:52.764 --> 14:55.232
Well, nowadays almost everybody
has these inspections done,

14:55.300 --> 14:57.200
Since an entire industry
kind of sprung up

14:57.268 --> 14:58.902
Convincing people
that it could kill you.

14:58.970 --> 15:01.138
Uh, in this case,
it did.

15:01.205 --> 15:02.439
Well, usually it's harmless,

15:02.507 --> 15:05.108
But not something
that people wanna deal with.

15:05.176 --> 15:08.912
Maybe that's why the building
flipped ownership so fast.

15:10.148 --> 15:12.382
There's lots
of different
kinds of molds.

15:12.450 --> 15:13.817
What are you lookin' for?

15:13.885 --> 15:15.185
Well, here it is.
"aflatoxin."

15:15.253 --> 15:16.186
Jim called earlier.

15:16.254 --> 15:17.521
This is what
killed kirk.

15:17.589 --> 15:18.855
Who would have
gotten this?

15:18.923 --> 15:21.558
Um, the realtors
who handled the sale,

15:21.626 --> 15:23.226
The owner, and the buyer,

15:23.294 --> 15:24.761
Would rita
have seen it?

15:24.829 --> 15:26.930
I mean, it's possible.
it's just something

15:26.998 --> 15:30.400
That the seller has
to disclose to the buyer,
but she was neither.

15:30.468 --> 15:32.502
So that would mean
she would have to know

15:32.570 --> 15:34.071
Exactly what
he was allergic to

15:34.138 --> 15:36.740
And then scour
every building listing
looking for a building

15:36.808 --> 15:38.342
With that exact
kind of mold.

15:38.409 --> 15:39.943
Come on.
that's a little nutty.

15:40.011 --> 15:40.944
Or genius.

15:41.012 --> 15:42.613
It's the perfect crime.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.648
She let me
right into a trap.

15:44.716 --> 15:46.083
How did she do that?

15:46.150 --> 15:47.584
I was supposed to
meet her there that day.

15:47.652 --> 15:48.819
Under the building?

15:48.886 --> 15:49.920
Well, maybe she, uh--

15:49.988 --> 15:51.722
I don't know--
moved my--moved my body.

15:51.789 --> 15:53.190
The police said
that your body
was never moved.

15:53.257 --> 15:54.524
Did you tell them
everything that you know?

15:54.592 --> 15:56.059
Did you tell them everything
that i told you?

15:56.127 --> 15:57.427
Uh, more than i'm
comfortable with.

15:57.495 --> 15:58.895
Look, i know that
you're angry with her,

15:58.963 --> 16:00.364
But this is your wife
we're talking about.

16:00.431 --> 16:01.632
Why would she
do this to you?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.834
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

16:03.901 --> 16:06.069
Probably because
you never answer any.

16:06.137 --> 16:08.171
And what was with
the entrails?

16:08.239 --> 16:10.440
What? wh-what are you
talking about? what--

16:10.508 --> 16:12.342
How'd you find out
about that?

16:12.410 --> 16:13.677
Oh, you didn't mean
for me to see them?

16:13.745 --> 16:15.846
I thought all you cared about
was bringing me peace.

16:15.913 --> 16:17.648
[bell rings]

16:17.715 --> 16:20.150
Rita jansen
was taken in
by the police.

16:20.218 --> 16:22.619
Right. you see?
she did it. i was right.

16:22.687 --> 16:24.354
Oh. hey, kirk.

16:24.422 --> 16:26.490
Was she placed
under arrest?

16:26.557 --> 16:28.425
No. officially she's
a person of interest.

16:28.493 --> 16:29.493
The cops are
all over her.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.028
They found
some incriminating
photographs.

16:31.095 --> 16:32.596
I was just
with detective blair.
i saw them.

16:32.664 --> 16:34.031
They were taken by
a private investigator.

16:34.098 --> 16:35.866
See? i knew she was
lying about something,

16:35.933 --> 16:37.234
And when i saw
those photos--

16:37.301 --> 16:39.036
Establishes motive.
they just have
to prove means.

16:39.103 --> 16:40.937
You have to show them
the mold report.

16:41.005 --> 16:42.372
She had to know
about that.

16:42.440 --> 16:43.840
She had to--
you don't know that.

16:43.908 --> 16:45.075
You know what i know?

16:45.143 --> 16:46.743
I know that rita's
gonna hate jail,

16:46.811 --> 16:48.945
And for the first time
since my trachea shut

16:49.013 --> 16:51.515
And my tongue
got as big as your shoe,

16:51.582 --> 16:53.083
I'm feeling a little peace.

17:01.824 --> 17:03.825
Police are questioning rita now.
you can't just barge in there.

17:04.193 --> 17:06.894
I'm not. what's the name
of the detective
who took those photos?

17:06.961 --> 17:08.529
Nick. nick sexton.
delia's gonna call you

17:08.596 --> 17:09.997
With the address.
what's the rush?

17:10.065 --> 17:12.598
I just need to find out
what was going on
in that marriage

17:12.666 --> 17:14.167
Before rita
says anything
to incriminate herself.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.736
It's a little
too late for that.

17:15.804 --> 17:17.471
Here.

17:17.539 --> 17:18.839
This is what
you saw, right?

17:18.906 --> 17:19.839
Yeah. that's it.

17:19.907 --> 17:21.208
Well, the cops
saw it, too.

17:21.276 --> 17:23.242
When they get ahold
of that mold report,

17:23.310 --> 17:24.678
It's not gonna
look good for her.

17:25.146 --> 17:26.079
Wait. what's this?

17:26.146 --> 17:27.914
I didn't see
this picture.

17:27.982 --> 17:29.749
That's the brownstone
where kirk died.

17:29.817 --> 17:31.051
The ghost said
she lured him there.

17:31.119 --> 17:32.285
Could this be
what he meant?

17:32.353 --> 17:35.255
Maybe the p.i. wasn't
the only one following rita.

17:35.323 --> 17:36.656
Maybe kirk was going
to confront her.

17:36.724 --> 17:38.225
In a crawl space?

17:38.292 --> 17:40.360
You really won't let go
of that crawl space, will you?

17:40.428 --> 17:42.095
It's the only thing
he can't explain away.

17:42.163 --> 17:43.463
What do you mean?

17:43.531 --> 17:45.632
His story keeps
changing every time
we find something new.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.400
Well, if she didn't
do it, who did?

17:47.468 --> 17:49.136
Mold spores,
as far as i know.

17:49.203 --> 17:50.770
At first, it was all,
"i'm sad, and i'm lost,

17:50.838 --> 17:52.339
And i can't believe
she'd try to kill me,"

17:52.406 --> 17:54.441
And then the next thing,
he was admitting that
she had cheated.

17:54.509 --> 17:56.009
Guess it's all just
a part of his motive.

17:56.077 --> 17:57.110
Because he hated her.

17:57.178 --> 17:58.778
I'm just not sure
how much.

17:58.846 --> 18:00.680
Maybe enough
to frame her.

18:00.748 --> 18:02.682
How are you
gonna undo that?

18:02.750 --> 18:04.017
I don't know.

18:06.020 --> 18:07.921
And i started doing magic
when i was 9.

18:07.989 --> 18:09.055
I thought that was young.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.423
How long have
you been practicing?

18:10.458 --> 18:11.491
Aiden: few days.

18:11.559 --> 18:12.993
You've already outgrown
your magic kit?

18:13.060 --> 18:15.562
I think it's 'cause
his friends have
seen all his tricks,

18:15.630 --> 18:17.197
And he's just
looking for new ones.

18:17.265 --> 18:18.465
Like these.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.134
Wait. you've mastered
every one of those tricks?

18:21.202 --> 18:23.136
You wanna see
a mind-reading trick?

18:23.204 --> 18:25.338
Ok, kid. sure.

18:29.243 --> 18:32.179
Turn around and write
down any word you want.

18:32.246 --> 18:34.014
All right.

18:39.086 --> 18:42.022
All right. i'm ready.

18:43.658 --> 18:44.658
Turtle.

18:47.595 --> 18:48.862
That's awesome.

18:48.930 --> 18:51.898
Wait a minute. buddy,
how did--how did
you just do that?

18:53.201 --> 18:54.534
Are there some mirrors
back there?

18:54.602 --> 18:56.336
Wait. did you guys
just exchange
a magician's code word?

18:56.404 --> 18:58.004
No. really.

18:59.240 --> 19:01.408
Can i look
at some more stuff?

19:01.475 --> 19:02.576
Yeah. yeah. go ahead.

19:06.247 --> 19:07.914
That's incredible.

19:07.982 --> 19:09.249
Yeah, it is incredible,

19:09.317 --> 19:12.485
Especially since
he can't even read yet.

19:12.553 --> 19:15.689
Yeah, we have
all the listings
you asked for.

19:15.756 --> 19:17.691
Hi. ok, sure,
we'll get right on it.

19:17.758 --> 19:19.659
Thank you, bye.

19:19.727 --> 19:20.727
Rita.

19:20.795 --> 19:22.495
Hello, delia.

19:22.563 --> 19:24.331
Wh-what's goin' on?
what are you doing here?

19:24.398 --> 19:27.500
Well, i hear you've been
asking around about
some of my listings.

19:27.568 --> 19:29.035
You did?

19:29.103 --> 19:31.338
Sidling up to every
agent in my office.

19:31.405 --> 19:32.906
The faylans' open house.

19:32.974 --> 19:34.975
Just so you know,
i'm still in the game.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.510
I haven't missed
a single showing
since the day kirk died.

19:37.578 --> 19:40.013
You think i'm poaching
your listings?

19:40.081 --> 19:41.281
I'm a highly
functioning person.

19:41.349 --> 19:43.016
I'm hardly undone
by my husband's death.

19:43.084 --> 19:45.252
Oh, and don't
be going after
his listings either.

19:45.319 --> 19:46.987
His clients know me,
and they trust me.

19:48.956 --> 19:51.458
Would you, uh, mind
going and finding

19:51.525 --> 19:54.294
The, uh, parkside paperwork?
mm-hmm.

19:54.362 --> 19:55.829
Yeah, and just, um--

19:55.896 --> 19:59.266
Just take your time
till you find it.

19:59.333 --> 20:03.436
Rita, i swear
to you i am not trying
to get your business

20:03.504 --> 20:05.772
Or kirk's. i was...

20:07.174 --> 20:11.444
I was asking about you
because i was concerned

20:11.512 --> 20:14.547
And, ok,
because i'm nosy.

20:14.615 --> 20:16.249
Well, that, i buy.

20:16.317 --> 20:17.951
Why don't you come
and sit down?

20:18.019 --> 20:19.886
You look like
you've had a bad day.

20:19.954 --> 20:21.888
You have no idea.

20:26.694 --> 20:28.295
They think i did it.

20:28.362 --> 20:29.729
Who? the police?

20:29.797 --> 20:31.464
And it is so unfair.

20:31.532 --> 20:33.133
I know, honey.
it must be awful.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.103
Because now i'm gonna
have to wait so long
and act all broken up

20:37.171 --> 20:39.105
Before i get on
with my life,

20:39.173 --> 20:41.675
Assuming i'm not serving
a life sentence, i mean.

20:41.742 --> 20:45.145
I--i just don't want
people to think i'm cold.

20:45.212 --> 20:47.781
I know. we seemed like
the perfect couple.

20:47.848 --> 20:50.317
We did, didn't we?

20:51.352 --> 20:53.586
Yes. of course.

20:53.654 --> 20:54.587
Perfect.

20:54.655 --> 20:56.356
But we weren't.

20:57.658 --> 20:59.459
You're a widow, right?

20:59.527 --> 21:02.696
Um, yes. mm-hmm.

21:02.763 --> 21:04.264
Well, how long
did you wait?

21:04.332 --> 21:07.467
I mean, how long
were you off the market

21:07.535 --> 21:09.469
Before you started
dating again?

21:11.138 --> 21:12.138
A long time.

21:12.206 --> 21:13.473
Was it difficult

21:13.541 --> 21:16.376
Finding someone
you clicked with,
who was your equal?

21:16.444 --> 21:18.144
Yes.

21:18.212 --> 21:20.480
I'm gonna give you
some free advice.

21:20.548 --> 21:21.948
Date anyone.

21:22.016 --> 21:23.616
Just have fun.

21:23.684 --> 21:26.152
Only, don't get caught up
in something that could--

21:26.220 --> 21:27.320
That could destroy you.

21:28.856 --> 21:31.891
Passion, it's not all
it's cracked up to be.

21:38.366 --> 21:40.567
I didn't work
for kirk for long,

21:40.634 --> 21:42.035
Just a couple
of weeks,

21:42.103 --> 21:43.570
Usually as
an independent
contractor--

21:43.637 --> 21:45.438
Or private
investigator,
as you say.

21:45.506 --> 21:46.806
But don't worry.
no offense.

21:46.874 --> 21:47.874
What a relief.

21:47.942 --> 21:50.276
Uh, normally i don't
share the details

21:50.344 --> 21:51.611
Of my employment
with anyone.

21:51.679 --> 21:53.346
Well, you talked
to the police.
thank you.

21:53.414 --> 21:55.382
Well, so it's, uh,
public record.

21:55.449 --> 21:56.416
I guess.

21:56.484 --> 21:58.718
You said you were
a friend of rita's?

21:58.786 --> 22:00.286
I'm just trying
to find out

22:00.354 --> 22:02.355
What went on between
her and her husband.

22:02.423 --> 22:04.224
Well, maybe it's better
you don't know.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.859
It's not gonna
help her case.

22:05.926 --> 22:06.993
Because she was
seeing another man?

22:07.061 --> 22:09.095
No, because she
hated her husband.

22:09.163 --> 22:10.764
The other man thing,
those things happen.

22:10.831 --> 22:14.100
Look, what i'm trying
to say is it's one thing
to have an affair.

22:14.168 --> 22:16.269
It's another to throw it
in your husband's face.

22:16.337 --> 22:18.671
So if kirk knew, then
why did he hire you?

22:18.739 --> 22:20.206
Well, he wasn't sure
at first,

22:20.274 --> 22:22.041
But she got onto me
pretty quick.

22:22.109 --> 22:24.577
Look. let me show you.

22:24.645 --> 22:26.546
Heh heh. yeah.

22:26.614 --> 22:29.649
Yeah, let me show you
the whole picture.

22:29.717 --> 22:31.651
Is that rita
flipping you the--

22:31.719 --> 22:32.652
And then some.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.521
Yeah, she knew
i was working for kirk,

22:34.588 --> 22:36.423
But she just kept on
seein' that guy.

22:36.490 --> 22:37.791
So why didn't
she leave him?

22:37.858 --> 22:39.192
Why didn't he leave her?

22:39.260 --> 22:41.861
Look, by the time i met him,
he was sick of her, too.

22:41.929 --> 22:44.898
But they had a business
together, reputations to keep.

22:44.965 --> 22:47.534
Neither one wanted
to be perceived as the bad guy,

22:47.601 --> 22:50.036
But really,
nobody wanted to lose.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.204
Lose what?

22:51.272 --> 22:52.639
This weird game
that they had started

22:52.706 --> 22:55.241
Of hurtin' each other.
it was like a competition.

22:55.309 --> 22:58.578
The stuff that they
came up with was very inventive,

22:58.646 --> 23:01.047
But sickening,

23:01.115 --> 23:02.315
Disgusting.

23:02.383 --> 23:06.719
Did any of their games
involve intestines?

23:06.787 --> 23:08.455
Oh, you heard about that?

23:08.522 --> 23:10.256
Oh ho!
that was vintage kirk

23:10.324 --> 23:14.294
He put entrails
into a refrigerator
at one of her open houses.

23:14.361 --> 23:16.563
Yeah, i bet she didn't
sell any condos that day.

23:16.630 --> 23:17.997
Heh heh heh heh.

23:18.065 --> 23:20.667
But i bet she didn't tell you
how it came on, though,

23:20.734 --> 23:22.302
Her little
stroke of genius,

23:22.369 --> 23:23.770
The shrimp incident.

23:23.838 --> 23:24.771
The shrimp incident?

23:24.839 --> 23:27.140
Yeah. yeah, kirk had
this huge property,

23:27.208 --> 23:28.975
All right?
a--a total mcmansion.

23:29.043 --> 23:33.413
So she sneaks in
and sews raw shrimp
into the custom drapes.

23:33.481 --> 23:34.514
Ohh...

23:34.582 --> 23:36.783
Man, it took days
to find the smell.

23:36.851 --> 23:38.351
By then, the stench
was so bad,

23:38.419 --> 23:40.186
The owners just
took it off the market.

23:40.254 --> 23:41.921
Do you think
that she could have
actually killed him?

23:41.989 --> 23:44.824
To be honest, he could have
just as easily have killed her.

23:44.892 --> 23:47.360
Look, this thing
wasn't gonna end

23:47.428 --> 23:49.395
Until they both
woke up and realized

23:49.463 --> 23:51.097
That they had married
the perfect--

23:51.165 --> 23:53.366
And i mean perfect--
person for each other

23:53.434 --> 23:54.801
Or one of 'em
ended up dead.

23:56.370 --> 23:58.338
And maybe
not even then.

23:58.405 --> 24:00.874
Yeah, it was hell.
the police kept
at me for hours.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.976
My lawyer kept
telling me to shut up.

24:03.043 --> 24:06.079
No, i don't know
when i'm gonna be back
in the office,

24:06.146 --> 24:09.749
But the party line
is that i am on top
of all my listings,

24:09.817 --> 24:11.384
Even if i'm in jail.

24:11.485 --> 24:14.020
No, i'm not joking.
it's entirely possible.

24:14.088 --> 24:15.355
Listen, i'm exhausted,

24:15.422 --> 24:17.357
And i might
get arrested tomorrow.

24:17.424 --> 24:18.758
I've gotta go.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.434
[sighing]

24:28.502 --> 24:30.503
[moaning]

25:00.668 --> 25:02.135
Aah!

25:07.441 --> 25:08.741
[winces]

25:08.809 --> 25:10.810
[gasping]

25:20.051 --> 25:21.485
Hi, rita.
melinda.

25:21.703 --> 25:23.337
So nice to meet you.

25:23.405 --> 25:25.239
Thanks for coming by.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.907
Well, anything for
a friend of delia's.

25:26.975 --> 25:28.842
This is a lovely home.

25:28.910 --> 25:30.811
Great curb appeal.

25:30.879 --> 25:32.579
We're not gonna have
any problem selling it.

25:32.647 --> 25:34.281
Great.

25:34.349 --> 25:35.349
Come on in.

25:35.417 --> 25:36.817
Thank you.

25:38.019 --> 25:40.621
Um, i hope you don't
mind me asking,

25:40.689 --> 25:41.955
But are you ok?

25:42.023 --> 25:44.124
Oh, for someone who's been
in a thousand homes,

25:44.192 --> 25:46.093
You'd think i'd know
my own well enough

25:46.161 --> 25:47.828
Not to trip over
my bathroom scale.

25:47.896 --> 25:49.396
Is that really
all that happened?

25:49.464 --> 25:51.565
Did i mention
i fell into my mirror?

25:53.968 --> 25:56.236
Look, i'm gonna
be honest with you.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.904
I'm not selling my house.

25:57.972 --> 26:01.441
I wanted to talk to you because
i think that you need my help.

26:01.509 --> 26:03.110
With what?

26:03.177 --> 26:04.411
Whatever hurt you last night

26:04.479 --> 26:07.514
Is the same thing that got you
in trouble with the police,

26:07.582 --> 26:09.983
And i believe
it's your husband kirk.

26:10.051 --> 26:12.486
Kirk? i'm--my lawyer
doesn't want me
discussing that.

26:12.553 --> 26:15.088
That's because he's trying
to keep you out of jail,

26:15.156 --> 26:17.290
But jail is gonna be
the least of your problems

26:17.358 --> 26:19.292
If we don't fix things
with your husband.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.527
Oh, my husband is dead.

26:20.595 --> 26:21.828
But he's not gone.

26:21.896 --> 26:23.163
I beg your pardon?

26:25.133 --> 26:26.967
I have a gift.

26:27.035 --> 26:28.135
I see spirits.

26:28.202 --> 26:29.836
They have
unfinished business,

26:29.904 --> 26:32.105
And i've talked
to your husband.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.306
Really?

26:33.374 --> 26:35.542
I know that it's hard
to believe, but trust me.

26:35.610 --> 26:37.511
This is just the beginning,

26:37.578 --> 26:40.147
Because he thinks
that you murdered him,

26:40.214 --> 26:41.848
And he is gonna continue
to punish you

26:41.916 --> 26:44.851
Until we can find
a way to make peace
for the two of you.

26:44.919 --> 26:46.453
I-is he here right now?

26:46.521 --> 26:49.156
No, but he's never
very far, so we don't
have a lot of time.

26:49.223 --> 26:50.991
Heh. i should have known

26:51.059 --> 26:52.993
The minute
i saw those shrimp.

26:53.061 --> 26:55.729
Ok, well, maybe if you
could just tell me
what went wrong--

26:55.797 --> 26:57.798
Are you gonna see kirk
anytime soon?

26:57.865 --> 27:00.267
Great, because i'd
like you to give him
this message for me.

27:02.103 --> 27:05.572
Please tell that
fluffed-up money-pit
hole in the ground

27:05.640 --> 27:07.574
I hope he burns in hell.

27:07.642 --> 27:09.843
Oh, that probably
isn't the best idea.

27:09.911 --> 27:12.746
Uh, kirk, you wanna
haunt me that bad,
bring it on.

27:12.814 --> 27:15.315
Uh, also probably
not the wisest choice.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.617
Wait. you really
wanna know what
went wrong with us?

27:18.619 --> 27:19.719
Kirk cheated
in his career,

27:19.787 --> 27:21.154
And he cheated
in our marriage.

27:21.222 --> 27:22.289
He had p.i.s
following me around,

27:22.356 --> 27:24.324
Taking my picture
all over town,

27:24.392 --> 27:26.126
But he was the one
who stepping out.

27:26.194 --> 27:28.395
Bet he didn't bother to
tell you that, did he?

27:33.801 --> 27:35.769
[door closes]

27:35.837 --> 27:38.905
It's like i was a part
of a reality show.

27:38.973 --> 27:41.741
I mean, why else would
anyone talk about their
husband that way? ooh.

27:41.809 --> 27:43.243
And her dead husband,
no less.

27:43.311 --> 27:44.611
Ok, i hate
to say it,
but it looks

27:44.679 --> 27:45.612
Like they've
picked up the fight

27:45.680 --> 27:46.880
Just where
they left it off.

27:46.948 --> 27:48.081
I mean,
if that p.i.'s
tellin' the truth.

27:48.149 --> 27:49.182
I think he was,

27:49.250 --> 27:50.984
At least, if you go by
what they're saying

27:51.052 --> 27:52.586
On the caravans and
at the open houses

27:52.653 --> 27:54.354
And what rita told me.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.858
It turns out there
was trouble in camelot
long before kirk died.

27:57.925 --> 28:00.227
Did anything happen
to trigger the change?

28:00.294 --> 28:02.028
The golden key happened.

28:02.096 --> 28:03.263
What, that goofy
sales award?

28:03.331 --> 28:05.132
I mean that really
cool sales award.

28:05.199 --> 28:07.567
No, he's right.
it is goofy.

28:07.635 --> 28:11.705
I mean, it's not even
an award for merit
or skill or character.

28:11.772 --> 28:13.340
No, it's just
the person who has

28:13.407 --> 28:14.374
The highest sales,
right?

28:14.442 --> 28:15.775
Yeah. i mean,
i don't even understand

28:15.843 --> 28:16.977
Why anybody even
cares about it.

28:17.044 --> 28:19.379
You know,
until i win one.

28:19.447 --> 28:22.382
God, i really just wanna
take one of those babies home.

28:22.450 --> 28:24.584
I guess rita wanted
to win one, too.

28:24.652 --> 28:26.753
Yeah, and she probably
deserved to get one,

28:26.821 --> 28:29.022
But he put his name
on enough of her listings,

28:29.090 --> 28:31.925
And they say that he took credit
for a lot of her sales.

28:31.993 --> 28:33.493
Why would she
let him do that?

28:33.561 --> 28:34.628
They were partners,
you know?

28:34.695 --> 28:36.897
She had her name
on some of his listings,

28:36.964 --> 28:39.166
But after the golden key,
you just started seeing

28:39.233 --> 28:41.935
His name on more and more
of the deals without hers.

28:42.003 --> 28:44.504
You know, i just assumed
it was marketing,

28:44.572 --> 28:46.673
That they both
agreed to it.

28:46.741 --> 28:48.441
Ok, she was jealous
of his new high profile.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.211
But, i mean, i gotta
say that's still not a
reason to kill somebody.

28:51.279 --> 28:52.512
Uh, she said
he was cheating

28:52.580 --> 28:54.047
In their marriage
and in their business.

28:54.115 --> 28:55.782
Oh, well.
did kirk ever
mention anybody else?

28:55.850 --> 28:58.185
No. he never stuck around
long enough

28:58.252 --> 29:00.353
To do anything but
throw accusations at her.

29:00.421 --> 29:03.623
You know what?
i do have those photos
that the p.i. took,

29:03.691 --> 29:04.691
You know,
with the other man.

29:04.759 --> 29:05.959
I mean,
eli mailed them to me.

29:06.027 --> 29:07.060
Yeah, let me
look at 'em.

29:07.128 --> 29:08.795
Maybe it's somebody
in the biz.

29:08.863 --> 29:10.263
Do you mean
mr. hottie?

29:10.331 --> 29:11.264
Oh, my god.

29:11.332 --> 29:13.934
Everybody
knows this guy.

29:14.001 --> 29:15.268
That's javier torres.

29:15.336 --> 29:18.038
He's the mortgage officer
over at the savings and loan.

29:18.105 --> 29:20.373
You can't do a deal
without him.

29:20.441 --> 29:22.943
And honestly,
who would want to?

29:23.010 --> 29:26.012
Rumor is, he's quite
the ladies man.
hmm.

29:26.080 --> 29:27.714
This is your
monthly payment now,

29:27.782 --> 29:29.382
And this is your
estimated payment

29:29.450 --> 29:31.318
With the new
lower rate.

29:31.385 --> 29:33.987
God, you make it
sound so simple.

29:34.055 --> 29:36.456
I am just hopeless
with numbers.

29:36.524 --> 29:38.225
Oh, i don't
believe that.

29:38.292 --> 29:39.926
It's lovely
for you to say that.

29:41.028 --> 29:42.862
Very lovely.

29:44.065 --> 29:44.998
What?

29:45.066 --> 29:46.132
[stammering]

29:46.200 --> 29:49.402
Uh, i was--i was
just saying that--

29:49.470 --> 29:53.039
That i don't--
i don't know anything
about real estate

29:53.107 --> 29:57.377
Except--you know,
i hate to gossip
about the dead,

29:57.445 --> 29:59.679
But you knew kirk, right,

29:59.747 --> 30:00.680
And rita?

30:00.748 --> 30:02.349
Yeah, it was very sad.

30:02.416 --> 30:04.651
And with the police
involved now, too...

30:04.719 --> 30:06.319
How well
did you know them?

30:06.387 --> 30:07.687
They brought
business to me,

30:07.755 --> 30:09.022
Especially rita.

30:09.090 --> 30:10.724
Hmm.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.761
It wasn't like that.

30:14.829 --> 30:16.796
Rita and i only got
to know each other well

30:16.864 --> 30:18.832
When she came
to me to finance
her own purchase.

30:18.899 --> 30:20.100
What was the purchase?

30:20.167 --> 30:21.701
She was buying
a brownstone.

30:21.769 --> 30:23.737
It was a stretch
for her on her own,

30:23.804 --> 30:25.572
So i helped her out
with the terms.

30:26.607 --> 30:27.741
On her own?

30:27.808 --> 30:29.709
So her husband wasn't
involved in the purchase?

30:29.777 --> 30:31.878
That would
defeat the purpose.

30:31.946 --> 30:33.546
What was the purpose?

30:33.614 --> 30:35.882
The building
was supposed
to be a surprise

30:35.950 --> 30:36.883
For him.

30:36.951 --> 30:38.785
See, they'd always
talked about

30:38.853 --> 30:40.520
Starting a bakery
together,

30:40.588 --> 30:43.890
An escape from
the real estate
rat race.

30:43.958 --> 30:46.026
"supposed to be a surprise."
so did he know that?

30:46.093 --> 30:47.360
I mean, what happened?

30:47.428 --> 30:49.162
I don't know.
i just know

30:49.230 --> 30:50.664
That she suddenly
changed her mind.

30:50.731 --> 30:54.367
She came to me, and
she begged me to take
the place off her hands.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.336
I couldn't afford
what she paid,

30:56.404 --> 30:59.272
So i made a low offer.
and she jumped.

30:59.340 --> 31:00.507
Look, i felt bad,

31:00.574 --> 31:02.909
But she said
i saved her life.

31:02.977 --> 31:04.678
Why would she sell so fast?

31:04.745 --> 31:05.979
I don't know
that either.

31:06.047 --> 31:07.814
But it turns out
she didn't get

31:07.882 --> 31:09.983
Such a bad price
from me after all,

31:10.051 --> 31:11.551
Because right after
i took possession,

31:11.619 --> 31:13.453
They found toxic mold
in the basement.

31:13.521 --> 31:16.056
So she didn't know
about the mold?

31:16.123 --> 31:18.892
If i thought she did,
i would have sued her.

31:18.959 --> 31:22.729
But the report
wasn't released
till after the closing.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.699
If she didn't know
about the mold, then she
couldn't have killed him.

31:25.766 --> 31:26.766
Excuse me?

31:36.644 --> 31:37.644
[gasps]

31:39.647 --> 31:42.182
What?
my best clothes!

31:51.726 --> 31:53.860
Unbelievable.

31:53.928 --> 31:55.195
Aah! god.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.534
There's more
where that came from.

32:01.602 --> 32:05.071
You should check
every toilet in the house.

32:05.139 --> 32:06.506
Sorry. some got stuck.

32:06.574 --> 32:08.575
So that woman was right.

32:08.642 --> 32:10.276
If you're really here.

32:10.344 --> 32:12.045
Mm-hmm.

32:12.113 --> 32:14.848
Well, i'm glad.

32:14.915 --> 32:17.517
Because there's
something i'd
like you to see.

32:17.585 --> 32:18.585
What?

32:22.390 --> 32:23.423
Ah.

32:23.491 --> 32:25.658
This is the first
house you sold.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.894
The new gates
community, remember.

32:27.962 --> 32:28.928
Oh, but wait.

32:28.996 --> 32:31.131
Wasn't i the one
that found the buyer

32:31.198 --> 32:32.799
Over at cliff daly's
open house?

32:32.867 --> 32:34.901
And somehow you got
all the credit.

32:34.969 --> 32:36.035
I don't think
this belongs

32:36.103 --> 32:38.238
On the leader board,
do you?

32:38.305 --> 32:40.006
[grunting]

32:40.074 --> 32:43.009
Oh, and the east river
development.

32:43.077 --> 32:45.011
The investor that
tipped the scale,

32:45.079 --> 32:46.713
Making you
the community leader.

32:46.781 --> 32:48.615
Sorry. my doing.

32:48.682 --> 32:51.017
Not yours.

32:51.085 --> 32:54.587
I will not watch you
wreck everything i built!

32:54.655 --> 32:56.356
This is fun!

32:57.458 --> 32:59.759
I'm warning you!

32:59.827 --> 33:01.094
Aah!

33:01.162 --> 33:02.962
Oh, i'm--i'm sorry.

33:03.030 --> 33:04.197
You don't
like me smashing

33:04.265 --> 33:07.267
All your undeserved,
unearned smarmy awards?

33:07.334 --> 33:08.701
Ok.

33:08.769 --> 33:10.603
I'll just have to smash
something else.

33:10.671 --> 33:12.238
What--rita.
rita. rita.

33:12.306 --> 33:14.174
No. rita! don't!
[grunting]

33:14.241 --> 33:15.775
Rita, don't do it.

33:15.843 --> 33:17.343
Rita, stop!

33:17.411 --> 33:19.345
Rita!

33:19.413 --> 33:21.014
Stop it!

33:21.081 --> 33:23.016
No, no, no, no.
calm--calm down.
calm--calm down.

33:23.083 --> 33:25.318
Rita! calm down.
don't do it.
don't do it!

33:28.088 --> 33:30.023
Oh, is that you,
dumpling?

33:30.090 --> 33:31.324
Oh, god.

33:31.392 --> 33:34.227
You're not
feeling very happy
right now, are you?

33:34.295 --> 33:36.863
Then why do
i feel so good?!

33:36.931 --> 33:38.164
Rita! rita!

33:38.232 --> 33:40.800
[grunting]

33:40.868 --> 33:43.636
All right, say good-bye
to everything
you've ever loved!

33:43.704 --> 33:45.805
Rita, don't! don't--
don't do it!
aah!

33:51.985 --> 33:53.152
Thanks for calling.

33:53.220 --> 33:56.422
You said
there's something
you need us to see?

33:56.490 --> 33:57.757
[gasps] oh, my god.

33:57.824 --> 34:00.426
It's the golden key.
can i hold it?

34:00.494 --> 34:05.531
Oh, look how it shimmers.
you just bask in its glow.

34:05.599 --> 34:06.599
[sighs]
all right.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.234
Deep breath.
your day will come.

34:08.301 --> 34:09.735
Why did you want us
to see this?

34:09.803 --> 34:10.936
Read
the inscription.

34:11.004 --> 34:12.237
"realtor of the year,

34:12.304 --> 34:14.306
Kirk jansen
and rita jansen."

34:14.373 --> 34:15.841
Why is her name on it?

34:15.909 --> 34:17.543
Look closer
at the engraving.

34:20.847 --> 34:22.248
The "rita jansen"
is new.

34:22.315 --> 34:23.849
You think kirk
added her name?

34:23.917 --> 34:25.484
I mean, why would
he do that?

34:25.552 --> 34:26.652
Yeah. what's it
doing here?

34:26.719 --> 34:28.853
My workmen
found it under
the crawl space.

34:28.922 --> 34:30.989
They dropped
a drill bit
through this hole,

34:31.091 --> 34:33.225
And when they went
to look for it,

34:33.293 --> 34:35.995
They saw this thing
glittering straight
underneath us.

34:36.063 --> 34:37.763
He must have
followed her here.

34:37.831 --> 34:38.964
And lost the award

34:39.032 --> 34:41.467
Just like the workers
lost the drill bit

34:41.534 --> 34:43.002
And then went down
to get it.

34:43.070 --> 34:44.937
And that's when he got
too close to the mold.

34:45.005 --> 34:47.172
So do you think
that this award

34:47.239 --> 34:49.775
Was a peace offering
from him to her?

34:49.842 --> 34:52.511
Yeah, just like this building
was supposed to be
from her to him.

34:52.579 --> 34:55.915
So they were actually
trying to make up with
each other,

34:55.982 --> 34:57.950
And neither of them
knows it.

34:58.018 --> 35:00.119
[sighs] all right.
i'll explain everything to rita.

35:00.187 --> 35:02.788
You know, i tried calling her,
but she didn't answer.

35:02.856 --> 35:04.390
I think you should
try and find her.

35:04.458 --> 35:05.458
Ok.

35:08.361 --> 35:10.029
Let go.

35:11.665 --> 35:12.865
Ok.

35:12.933 --> 35:13.899
Now i'm fine.

35:13.967 --> 35:15.167
Ok.

35:33.353 --> 35:34.887
Rita.

35:39.626 --> 35:42.394
[gasps] rita,
what did you do?

35:42.462 --> 35:45.364
Little overkill maybe,
but...

35:45.432 --> 35:46.699
I made my point.

35:46.767 --> 35:48.868
[sighs] is kirk here?

35:48.935 --> 35:50.903
I think he went
looking for glue.

35:52.105 --> 35:54.907
It didn't have to go
this way, the destruction--

35:54.975 --> 35:56.208
Oh, yes, it did.

35:56.276 --> 35:57.276
He had it coming.

35:57.344 --> 35:58.778
You didn't always
feel that way.

35:58.845 --> 36:00.880
I know about the brownstone
that you bought him.

36:00.947 --> 36:02.248
Because i'm an idiot.

36:02.315 --> 36:03.582
I thought he changed.

36:03.650 --> 36:04.850
What do you mean?

36:04.918 --> 36:06.085
Kirk's
a good-looking guy.

36:06.153 --> 36:08.554
He always got
lots of attention
from women.

36:08.622 --> 36:10.456
I mean, i got attention
from men, too,

36:10.524 --> 36:13.425
But we both knew
we used it for business.

36:13.493 --> 36:14.860
After the award,
he gave me

36:14.928 --> 36:16.762
Some speech
about leveraging
all the attention,

36:16.830 --> 36:18.130
Like it was
just business,

36:18.198 --> 36:20.699
But he loved the glory.

36:20.767 --> 36:22.902
He started
colisting properties

36:22.969 --> 36:25.204
With female agents,
attractive ones,

36:25.272 --> 36:27.373
So i started pulling
listings from him.

36:27.440 --> 36:29.775
And that's when
the feud started.

36:29.843 --> 36:31.577
I canceled one
of his open houses.

36:31.645 --> 36:32.845
He canceled
one of mine.

36:32.913 --> 36:34.113
The next thing you knew,

36:34.181 --> 36:35.948
I was sewing shrimp
into the curtains.

36:36.016 --> 36:38.951
I will never
touch scampi again.

36:39.019 --> 36:40.553
But you knew
it had to stop.

36:40.620 --> 36:43.255
Which is why
i bought the brownstone.

36:44.624 --> 36:45.958
It was
a peace offering.

36:46.026 --> 36:48.294
We'd met in a bakery,

36:48.361 --> 36:50.296
And we always talked
about having one.

36:50.363 --> 36:52.832
And all i got
for my efforts

36:52.899 --> 36:54.166
Was a fistful
of entrails

36:54.234 --> 36:56.335
And a p.i. who tracked
my every move.

36:56.403 --> 36:59.104
Do you know i think
he was planning
to divorce me?

37:00.140 --> 37:01.874
I think you're wrong
about that.

37:06.980 --> 37:08.547
He had it re-engraved--
oh.

37:08.615 --> 37:09.682
Just a few days ago
i think he was trying

37:09.749 --> 37:11.016
To give it to you
before he died.

37:11.084 --> 37:12.251
No, no. it's a trick.

37:12.319 --> 37:14.253
He was planning to pull
the rug out. i'm sure.

37:14.321 --> 37:15.921
The first thing
i learned in this business

37:15.989 --> 37:17.189
Is if someone
doesn't trust you,

37:17.257 --> 37:18.190
You can't trust them.

37:18.258 --> 37:20.593
Do you know how many
hours he spent

37:20.660 --> 37:22.127
In cars and houses
with beautiful,
rich women?

37:22.195 --> 37:24.029
Of course
he didn't want me
to be with him.

37:24.097 --> 37:27.032
And i did it all for you,
you lying, cheating--

37:27.100 --> 37:28.968
Ah-ah--
yeah, it takes
one to know one,

37:29.035 --> 37:32.938
You--you sad,
pathetic,
egomaniacal--

37:33.006 --> 37:35.174
W-wait a minute.

37:35.242 --> 37:36.442
You're dead.

37:36.509 --> 37:38.010
Funny you should notice,
considering you killed me.

37:38.078 --> 37:40.446
Well, how can
i see you?

37:40.513 --> 37:43.782
I was trying to find
a way to tell you.

37:43.850 --> 37:45.651
Uh, you died.

37:45.719 --> 37:47.586
You didn't have to.

37:54.060 --> 37:55.060
The light table.

37:57.564 --> 38:00.032
The metal golf club
must have touched
a wire.

38:00.099 --> 38:01.567
I electrocuted
myself.

38:01.634 --> 38:04.770
And you didn't realize
that he was trying
to make it up to you.

38:04.837 --> 38:06.271
What?
y-you see?

38:06.339 --> 38:07.706
I'm--i'm a good guy.

38:07.774 --> 38:09.308
And you should have
trusted your wife.

38:09.375 --> 38:11.176
She didn't kill you.
she didn't even know
about the mold.

38:11.244 --> 38:12.611
Hmm.

38:12.679 --> 38:13.679
What are you
talking about?

38:13.746 --> 38:15.214
[sighs] it was a gift,

38:15.281 --> 38:17.616
The bakery that you
both had dreamt of.

38:17.684 --> 38:21.486
You know, and then she
found out that you had
somebody following her,

38:21.554 --> 38:24.690
And so she
got rid of it,
you know, out of anger,

38:24.757 --> 38:27.693
And that was
before she even knew
about the mold report.

38:27.760 --> 38:28.694
Is that true?

38:28.761 --> 38:30.696
You couldn't
just trust me?

38:30.763 --> 38:33.165
I--i always thought
the bakery was a dream,

38:33.233 --> 38:34.666
Something
that we made up.

38:34.734 --> 38:36.068
It was,

38:36.135 --> 38:39.438
But isn't everything
until you decide
to make it real?

38:41.007 --> 38:42.941
I feel terrible.

38:43.009 --> 38:44.476
That means
everything i--

38:44.544 --> 38:47.980
I made up all the--
all the mistrust,
the--the...

38:48.047 --> 38:49.815
Uh...
suspicion.

38:49.882 --> 38:52.417
The--the suspicion.
i--

38:52.485 --> 38:54.553
I got us
both killed. i...

38:55.588 --> 38:57.422
I'm sorry, too.

38:57.490 --> 39:01.159
But look on the bright side.
it's not a teardown.

39:01.227 --> 39:02.394
Yeah.

39:02.462 --> 39:04.763
We're both still here.

39:05.765 --> 39:06.765
Yeah.

39:08.234 --> 39:10.535
And you're partners,
right?

39:10.603 --> 39:12.437
Mm-hmm.

39:12.505 --> 39:14.239
Yeah.

39:15.942 --> 39:16.875
Oh, sorry.

39:16.943 --> 39:19.077
I still have
a bit of a charge.

39:19.145 --> 39:20.078
It'll pass.

39:20.146 --> 39:22.147
No, not for me.

39:28.321 --> 39:29.755
Do you smell that?

39:32.592 --> 39:35.127
Fresh baked bread.

39:35.194 --> 39:36.828
Heh.

39:58.051 --> 40:01.086
There's no way he
could have known that
the word was "turtle."

40:01.154 --> 40:03.155
I mean,
obviously i didn't
notice anything, but--

40:03.222 --> 40:04.523
You don't seem
very surprised.

40:04.590 --> 40:08.160
[sighs] why would i be?
i did that stuff as a kid.

40:08.227 --> 40:10.829
Wait. you conned
your friends with
ghost magic?

40:10.897 --> 40:13.999
Well, not that part,
but they did help me
with test answers.

40:14.067 --> 40:18.904
Ooh, and they would
always tell me when a boyfriend
was flirting with another girl.

40:18.971 --> 40:20.906
That is unfair.
you did that?

40:20.973 --> 40:22.240
Of course i did.

40:22.308 --> 40:25.243
It was the only perk
to being a freak...

40:25.311 --> 40:29.614
Until my grandmother
sat me down and explained
that it wasn't right.

40:29.682 --> 40:31.650
Hmm.

40:31.718 --> 40:35.320
Does that mean
it's time for us
to sit aiden down?

40:35.388 --> 40:37.522
Yeah. poor little guy.

40:40.126 --> 40:42.627
Ok. ready?

40:44.163 --> 40:45.364
Now take over.

40:48.668 --> 40:49.668
Heh heh.

40:51.771 --> 40:53.505
Gus is gonna
love this.

40:53.573 --> 40:55.207
Melinda: aiden.

40:57.076 --> 40:58.210
We need to talk.

40:58.277 --> 40:59.277
Am i in trouble?

40:59.345 --> 41:01.380
A little.

41:02.448 --> 41:03.682
What'd i do?

41:03.750 --> 41:04.750
Here's the thing.

41:05.785 --> 41:07.052
You have a mom

41:07.120 --> 41:09.654
Who can do things
that other moms can't.

41:09.722 --> 41:11.390
And you're a kid

41:11.457 --> 41:14.493
Who can do things
that other kids can't.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.495
But since those things
are secret--

41:16.562 --> 41:18.830
So you think
if i do tricks,

41:18.898 --> 41:20.832
They'll find out
our secret?

41:22.168 --> 41:23.769
No.

41:23.836 --> 41:25.203
No, i just--

41:25.271 --> 41:26.938
I don't think it's fair.

41:30.676 --> 41:32.010
I don't understand.

41:38.084 --> 41:40.218
Ok, um...

41:42.054 --> 41:46.691
Sometimes magic tricks
can be like lies.

41:46.759 --> 41:49.694
But it's ok
for a magician
to fool people,

41:49.762 --> 41:52.364
Because they know
that they're being
fooled, right?

41:52.432 --> 41:54.499
Mm-hmm.
ok, but if you get help,

41:54.567 --> 41:58.303
Like from a--a ghost
or a shiny.

41:58.371 --> 42:01.206
Yeah. then
people don't know
that stuff's real.

42:02.642 --> 42:05.210
So it's like a lie.

42:05.278 --> 42:06.678
Yeah.

42:08.981 --> 42:10.715
Aiden, who helped you?

42:10.783 --> 42:13.785
Was it a ghost
or a shiny?

42:13.853 --> 42:15.420
It was a ghost.

42:16.823 --> 42:17.756
Which one?

42:17.824 --> 42:19.825
Different ghosts.

42:19.892 --> 42:22.427
There's a lot around.

42:23.596 --> 42:25.230
Yeah.

42:25.298 --> 42:26.865
I know.

42:27.867 --> 42:29.534
Sorry, mom.

42:29.602 --> 42:31.770
I promise i'll
never do it again.

42:31.838 --> 42:33.705
Hey...

42:33.773 --> 42:35.373
You're a good boy, aiden,

42:35.441 --> 42:37.275
And we trust you.

42:38.644 --> 42:40.779
[kiss]
you know that, right?

42:40.847 --> 42:41.947
Yeah.
all right.

42:41.981 --> 42:43.882
Let's get ready for bed.

42:43.950 --> 42:45.650
Can i play
some more?

42:45.718 --> 42:47.586
Heh. all right.

42:47.653 --> 42:50.655
5 minutes,
and then you
get ready for bed.

42:53.526 --> 42:54.626
Love you, mom.

42:55.995 --> 42:57.829
Sleep tight, baby.

43:00.233 --> 43:01.299
Night, dad.

43:02.468 --> 43:05.270
All right, 5 minutes.

43:05.338 --> 43:07.606
[door closes]

43:14.247 --> 43:15.580
I don't like lying.

43:15.648 --> 43:16.581
I know,

43:16.649 --> 43:18.483
But it's important.

43:18.551 --> 43:20.185
No one can know i'm here.

43:20.253 --> 43:21.620
Why not?

43:21.687 --> 43:22.621
'cause...

43:22.688 --> 43:24.723
If they find out,

43:24.790 --> 43:26.691
Something bad
will happen.

43:26.759 --> 43:28.360
What?

43:28.427 --> 43:30.395
Something really bad.
