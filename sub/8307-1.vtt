00:43.360 --> 00:47.680
<i>I know, I know. This all seemed</i>
<i>decidedly more amusing last</i>
<i>night.</i>

00:50.040 --> 00:52.600
Have you had a chance
to check this latest data?

00:52.600 --> 00:55.080
The molecular changes
in Max's marrow...

00:55.080 --> 00:56.800
We're closing in on it,
honey.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.280
I really feel like all of our
hard work is about to pay off.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.640
Why wasn't she in the mess
module for breakfast this
morning?

01:03.640 --> 01:07.000
I don't know. Are you sure
she's even awake yet?

01:08.640 --> 01:10.760
Zenon?

01:12.280 --> 01:15.040
Zenon, it's 7:45.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.960
Cetus-Lupeedus,
how'd it get to be so late?

01:17.960 --> 01:21.880
Get moving, please. Your Dad
and I have to get to the lab.
Come on.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.240
<i>Remember, you loathe</i>
<i>waking up this way.</i>

01:26.240 --> 01:29.280
<i>-Time Minor, Tasks Major.</i>
-Oh, shut up.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.200
<i>There's one thing to be</i>
<i>thankful for. At least you</i>
<i>don't live down there.</i>

02:01.680 --> 02:03.640
I am going to be
in so much trouble.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.800
Excuse me, coming through.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.480
The kitchen,
Zenon, is closed.

02:14.480 --> 02:17.960
No, wait! I didn't...
Wait, wait... No! Ow! Ow!

02:27.800 --> 02:30.520
Thanks, Gemma.
You're a life saver.

02:36.320 --> 02:38.040
Excuse me. Coming through.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.120
Come on. Hurry.

02:41.120 --> 02:43.880
No... Wait, wait, wait!
No, no, no, no!

02:43.880 --> 02:46.480
Not good. This is not good.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.680
Also the fusion trays
in the cafeteria are misfiring.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.000
Tell Andy in engineering
to use...

02:52.000 --> 02:55.760

05:09.760 --> 05:14.520
I guess I got all
flared-up because...

05:14.520 --> 05:17.840
I never knew history

Zenon says Microbe's coming
right to this very station.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.720
Not a Giant Screen performance,
not a hologram.

Microbe's coming!

06:20.280 --> 06:24.960
Microbe? They're about as thermo
as some band from back in 2025.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.480
According to who, Aquila? They
happen to be the greatest ever.

06:28.480 --> 06:31.960
Their songs have melodies.
I mean, those guys are so
anti-matter

06:31.960 --> 06:34.440
you can actually
understand their lyrics.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.440
-What'd you expect?
-BOTH: Men!

06:36.440 --> 06:41.040
Wait, wait. I still haven't told
you the best part. They're

06:41.040 --> 06:44.680
The winner gets to dance on

believe it?

06:44.680 --> 06:47.760
I'm going to get

Ladies and gentlemen.

06:54.800 --> 06:59.360
May I have your attention
for a moment. Please? Thank you.

Now, as all of you
undoubtedly already know,

07:08.360 --> 07:11.400
...Parker Wyndham, owner
and chief operating officer

07:11.400 --> 07:13.280
of our parent company,
WyndComm,

07:13.280 --> 07:16.160
will be paying our space station
a visit on Friday.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.880
(MURMURING)

07:17.880 --> 07:19.400
Shh, shh, shh...

Now, I don't think
I'm giving away any secrets

07:22.120 --> 07:25.200
when I say this has not
been our finest year.

07:25.200 --> 07:28.840
March we had cooling system
leaks, May brought power
blackouts.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.160
And that small,
unfortunate computer room fire.

07:32.160 --> 07:34.320
Yes, that small fire.

07:34.320 --> 07:37.880
Well, our space station
is 27 years old, people.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.840
The fact is, it needs major
improvements and repairs.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.680
And since many of you
are so close

07:42.680 --> 07:46.400
to successfully completing your
most prodigious experiments,

07:46.400 --> 07:50.120
it would be a shame to have
Wyndham shut us down at such
a juncture.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.360
Well, he'll never do that be
cause we won't let him, right?

07:53.360 --> 07:55.560
(CHEERING)

07:55.560 --> 08:00.400
Yes, I know. I know we feel
that way, but our job is
to convince Wyndham.

08:00.400 --> 08:04.080
We need to get him excited
about our research,
to show him things.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.800
Like the fine work
on bone marrow density

08:06.800 --> 08:10.560
being done by Mark
and Astrid Kar,

08:10.560 --> 08:14.240
that could literally
save millions of lives.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.920
Wyndham needs to understand
why so many of us

08:16.920 --> 08:19.920
have devoted so much of our
lives to this place.

08:19.920 --> 08:24.600
He needs to see that we are
a dedicated, hard-working,

08:24.600 --> 08:26.320
cost-conscious asset

08:26.320 --> 08:29.600
that he simply
cannot afford to abandon!

08:29.600 --> 08:31.200
(CHEERING)

08:32.840 --> 08:35.600
Now, I'm counting
on each and every one of you.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.440
I know you will
make me proud.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.960
What's gonna happen to us
if the Wyndham beast rockets up

09:05.960 --> 09:08.560
and hangs a condemned sign
on our space-stay?

09:08.560 --> 09:11.040
Slow down, Zee.
Retro-fire.

09:11.040 --> 09:15.040
But I've been here since I was
five, and I don't want to live
anyplace else.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.040
-No one is going anywhere.
-But Commander Plank said...

09:18.040 --> 09:21.880
All we have to do is convince
Wyndham how valuable our work
is, so we will.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.200
We couldn't do our experiments
anywhere but a space station.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.800
Because you need a lab with
a weightless chamber. I know.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.240
Hi, Cleo.

09:30.240 --> 09:32.880
ASTRID: She actually listens
to us once in a while.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.520
Wow.

09:34.520 --> 09:38.080
So, Wyndham would have to be a
Scrooge Major to shut us down?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.520
Oh, exactly.
I mean, once he is here,

09:40.520 --> 09:43.600
we will blast him
into orbital bliss Major,

09:43.600 --> 09:46.480
with all the great things
our scientists are doing.

09:46.480 --> 09:49.120
If you're so concerned
about his visit, help out.

09:49.120 --> 09:50.720
How?

09:50.720 --> 09:53.920
Start by trying to keep your
gang in line while Wyndham's
aboard.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.400
No air duct cruising,
no recycle bin diving,

09:56.400 --> 09:59.360
and please, please, try
to stay out of restricted zones.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.280
-OK.
-Thank you.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.920
You'd fully blow an O-ring
if we had to return to Earth,
huh, Mom?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.680
Mom?

10:08.680 --> 10:10.640
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.320
Hey honey, um,

10:13.320 --> 10:16.280
why don't you let us get back
to work, OK, sweetheart?

10:16.280 --> 10:17.840
See you at dinner?

10:20.960 --> 10:22.560
-Love you.
-Bye.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.520
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYS)

10:27.520 --> 10:30.480
I think that if Microbe's coming
all the way from Earth,

10:30.480 --> 10:34.520
-somebody's getting rich
off of it.
-So young and yet so cynical.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.080
Everything down there
is motivated by money.

10:37.080 --> 10:40.160
Everything down there
is motivated by self-defense.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.520
You've gotta watch for germs,
speeding trucks, earthquakes,
madmen, muggers...

10:44.520 --> 10:47.120
You were in kindergarten
when we came up here.

10:47.120 --> 10:48.640
My mom's told me stories.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.520
She was in that horrible
earthquake back in '35.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.480
And once she got robbed
at gunpoint.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.800
Why do you think her mom was
so anxious to bring her up here?

10:56.800 --> 10:58.520
-Can I borrow this?
-Yes.

10:58.520 --> 11:03.120
Down on Earth, people with runny
noses are packed together like
microchips.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.800
Yeah,
I've never even sneezed.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.800
Plus, Earth's gravity
adds about 30 pounds to you.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.800
Can you imagine playing?

11:11.960 --> 11:14.640
The weather? One minute
you have rain, then snow.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.640
Then a fully
anti-matter tornado.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.520
How would you ever know
what to wear?

11:18.520 --> 11:22.360
Face it, our lives are like a
day at the Jovian moon compared
to theirs.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.880
-Yeah, yeah.
But I still think...
-Don't, OK?

11:24.880 --> 11:26.960
That's when he ends up
in trouble.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.240
We'll have to ice
while Wyndham's here.

11:29.240 --> 11:33.040
It's only three or four days.
How hard can it possibly be?

11:33.040 --> 11:36.320
-For you? Impossible.
-Lunarious bracelet, Neb.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.960
Thanks. I found the disks in
a Satellite Lab recycling bin.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.760
They have
the best throwaways.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.160
I decorated two whole t-shirts
with their discards. I'll show
you.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.160
As fascinating as this is, are
we gonna do something tonight
or what?

11:50.160 --> 11:52.520
Oh, it would be stellar
if we could catch

11:52.520 --> 11:54.760
the Class Five Solar Flare
that's due.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.120

If my dad found out I swiped the
code book to get us down here,

12:09.280 --> 12:11.120
he'll go
into global meltdown.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.480

Yell him we simply needed
to gain a deeper understanding

12:15.520 --> 12:17.120

12:17.120 --> 12:19.480
Couldn't you be happy
watching the thing in here?

12:19.480 --> 12:21.520
I mean,
we have a perfect view.

12:21.520 --> 12:25.560
Why be in the audience, Neb,
when you have a chance to be
center stage?

12:26.560 --> 12:28.040
Come on.

Now remember, if you hear
anybody coming, tug on my
tether.

Are you sure about this?

Trust me, Lynx,

I don't understand
why I'm getting all the blame?

14:58.200 --> 15:00.520
The other kids
were down there, too.

15:00.520 --> 15:04.040
Excuse me, but were the other
kids out of the craft?

15:04.040 --> 15:07.160
Lynx told her mother
the entire thing was your idea.

15:07.160 --> 15:09.880
Really nice!
Why would she go and say that?

15:09.880 --> 15:13.320
Oh, I don't know. Probably
because everything always is.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.000
Must make you proud to know
you're raising a leader, huh?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.880
Stow the jokes, Zenon.
This is serious.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.960
You guys are constantly begging
me to take a greater interest
in science.

15:24.960 --> 15:29.640
Then tonight when I finally do,
everyone gets all gaseous on me.

15:29.640 --> 15:32.520
An unauthorized
middle-of-the-night space walk

15:32.520 --> 15:34.320
is hardly what we had in mind.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.480
Sweetheart, what if
your tether broke?

15:36.480 --> 15:39.160
What if we got bombarded
by a sudden meteor shower?

15:39.160 --> 15:44.080
-I can handle myself. I'm 13.
-Then you better start
acting like it.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.240
You have to admit,
it was pretty stellar.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.880
It was probably the best one
we will ever have an opportunity
to see.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.920
Those colors were undulating.
It was almost like a religious
ex...

15:58.920 --> 16:01.000
You were still very wrong
to go out in it.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
That is exactly the kind
of thing that cannot happen
when Wyndham's here.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.040
-Are we clear?
-Yes, ma'am.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.320
It's tough, but if we don't
buckle down while Wyndham's
here,

16:10.320 --> 16:12.440
he could have
our mission scrubbed.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.760
Scrubbed, Zenon.
As in over for all of us.

16:15.760 --> 16:17.920
Do you want to be a part
of causing that?

16:19.680 --> 16:24.800
You know that I would
only say this as a last resort,

16:24.800 --> 16:29.360
but mess up again and your
father and I will be forced
to ground you.

I didn't know
you could do a whole sculpture.

Man, I just did a dumb essay
about what dancing with Proto
Zoa would mean to me.

17:08.280 --> 17:11.920
You're a lunarious writer, Neb.
I'm sure it was Impressive

17:11.920 --> 17:13.560
Mm-hmm.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.760
You don't have any stellar chain
I could use for his guitar, do
you?

-No. But tomorrow's

-Right, right.

I'm sure the Discard Bin's

-Can't. Math homework.

-Oh, yeah.
-Have you met
the Wyndham beast yet?

17:27.960 --> 17:30.640
Not yet. But I heard
he got in a few hours ago.

17:30.640 --> 17:34.480
And because life isn't hard
enough, Plank-the-Blank plucked
my parents

17:34.480 --> 17:38.960
into being his tour guides.

Mr. Wyndham.
Hi, I'm Zenon.

18:00.280 --> 18:04.080
I didn't mean to interrupt your
tour, but I've heard so much
about you.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.400
I couldn't wait
to make your acquaintance.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.920
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.600
-This is my assistant,
Mr. Lutz.
-Hi.

18:10.600 --> 18:13.920
-Oh, is that Proto Zoa I see?
-Oh, yeah.

You know, I happen to be
quite a microscope fan myself.

18:16.760 --> 18:20.160

and tell me honestly,

18:30.880 --> 18:34.240
how do you like living
up here in space?

18:34.240 --> 18:38.600
Well, the life
your very generous support

18:38.600 --> 18:40.800
has created for me
and my rads

18:40.800 --> 18:45.200

Thank you.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.920
Well, let me just say,
if you ever consider
a career in PR, my dear,

18:59.920 --> 19:03.760
WyndComm Enterprises could
definitely use your services.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.480
And how. Well...

19:05.480 --> 19:09.840
Well, uh, math homework.
Sorry.

19:09.840 --> 19:12.640

we have the cryogenics lab.

As soon as I told Mr. Wyndham
I loved TurboMaster movies,

19:19.800 --> 19:23.800
he started quoting all the
dialogue, doing all the voices.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.160
It was hilarious.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.160
You know, when he looked over
my mom's Reflex System data,

19:28.160 --> 19:31.160
he actually understood it.
Not even my dad can do that.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.840
ZENON: Something about
that guy shivers me out.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.000
What are you talking about?
I mean, he's a great guy.

19:37.000 --> 19:41.000
Calling Planet Leo. The only
thing that should be that smooth
and oily

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
is a propulsion module
solar coil.

19:43.000 --> 19:45.480
This is from the girl
that said I was cynical.

19:45.480 --> 19:47.320
I wish I could
explain it more.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.960
I just get the very creepy
feeling that something doesn't
quite fit.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.680

you get one of these feelings,

use these computers to get
a jump on it.

to go in here.

For thousands of years

22:31.760 --> 22:34.240
for mathematicians
and scientists alike.

22:34.240 --> 22:38.440
The philosophers of ancient
Greece looked at these
principles

22:38.440 --> 22:41.000
as the universe's
guiding forces.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.600
It was the conjecture of the
great philosopher, Pythagoras,

22:44.600 --> 22:48.040
that our universe
was ruled by numbers,

obeyed their very specific laws.

to help us,

29:00.440 --> 29:03.320
I was fully following my gut
to prove he's not.

29:03.320 --> 29:05.240
I spoke to Mr. Lutz
and Mr. Wyndham.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.800
Neither has been out
of his quarters since dinner.

29:07.800 --> 29:11.360
That's not true!
They're lying! I saw Lutz.

29:11.360 --> 29:15.320
-Why would I be making this up?
-An attempt to save
your own skin.

29:15.320 --> 29:18.320
MARK: Commander!

29:18.320 --> 29:21.840
The security team says you
didn't tamper with the data
banks.

29:21.840 --> 29:23.880
And for that
we can all be grateful.

29:23.880 --> 29:27.040
I don't think you realize
how serious this is, Zenon.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.680
Being in a Class Four zone,

29:28.680 --> 29:31.520
you could've put everybody
on this station at risk.

29:31.520 --> 29:35.280
-But I didn't do anything!
-Clearly not for lack
of trying.

29:35.280 --> 29:37.080
Silence Major!

29:39.560 --> 29:42.160
This is the last straw, Zenon.

29:42.160 --> 29:46.120
Now I'm leaving the punishment
to your discretion, but do know
this.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.360
Unless you impose a sentence
as severe as the crime,

29:49.360 --> 29:51.520
I'll be forced
to take action myself.

29:51.520 --> 29:53.040
-But you're not...
-Zee!

29:53.040 --> 29:55.080
-But listen to me! Please!
-Let's go.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.240
No!

29:59.160 --> 30:04.240
I honestly think if you put
these on, it'll help all of us.

30:06.040 --> 30:09.200
Or not.

30:09.200 --> 30:13.240
You have put us in a very
difficult position, Zenon.

30:15.360 --> 30:19.680
You can't imagine how much
I don't want to do what
I have to do now.

30:19.680 --> 30:22.400
But you haven't left us
any choice.

30:23.240 --> 30:24.400
What?

30:26.080 --> 30:31.600
I'm sorry, Zee.
Your mother... and I...

30:31.600 --> 30:34.440
...have contacted
your Aunt Judy.

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
Aunt Judy?

30:38.640 --> 30:42.560
She hates space,
she hates to travel.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.040
You wanna bring her up here
to be my "keeper"?

30:46.240 --> 30:48.920
You don't get it, Zee.
We're grounding you.

30:48.920 --> 30:50.400
I understand that.

30:50.400 --> 30:54.080
No, Zee. I mean,
we're really grounding you.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.480
What?

31:02.920 --> 31:06.600
No. No, you can't...

31:12.720 --> 31:13.800
Dad?

31:21.280 --> 31:24.000
So, the rumor's true?
Zenon's really outta here?

31:24.000 --> 31:27.840
Isn't it the most gaseous thing
ever? They're shipping her off
this afternoon.

...to go to the perpetuation
and repairs of this, your

32:35.880 --> 32:39.520
Call it a vote of confidence
in the many benefits I know
we will all reap

32:39.520 --> 32:43.840
from the remarkable research
and experimentation being
conducted up here.

32:43.840 --> 32:46.560

Hey.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.960
Good morning.

45:42.320 --> 45:44.240
Settle now, please.

45:44.240 --> 45:48.160
If I may have
your attention...

45:48.160 --> 45:51.520
We have a new student joining us
today. Her name is Radon Kar.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.320
Actually, it's Zenon.

45:53.320 --> 45:56.320
-Like that's
a whole lot better?
-(LAUGHTER)

45:56.320 --> 46:00.240
People, people. Zenon is no
ordinary visiting student.

46:00.240 --> 46:04.280
She comes to us having spent
eight years on the WyndComm
Space Station.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.080
Hope she's had her shots.

46:06.080 --> 46:08.280
-(LAUGHTER)
-Now, that's enough, Margie.

46:08.280 --> 46:12.600
I'm sure there's a great deal
that Zenon can teach us while
she's here,

46:12.600 --> 46:15.600
if you'll all be wise enough
to give her that chance.

46:15.600 --> 46:17.200
(WHISTLE BLOWING)

46:17.200 --> 46:21.600
Come on, let's go, Tracy!
Come on, let's go...

46:21.600 --> 46:24.560
Come on, pull, pull.

46:24.560 --> 46:27.120
Beat your time. Do it!
Pull, pull!

46:27.120 --> 46:29.760
Come on. Pull.

46:29.760 --> 46:33.040
That's it, keep it up...

46:33.040 --> 46:35.720
OK, uh, new girl,
you can swim, can't you?

46:35.720 --> 46:37.680
Sweat Minor, Commander.

46:37.680 --> 46:41.280
I once swam from Perseus
to Pleiades in a Class Five
solar flare.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.560
(SCOFFS)

46:43.640 --> 46:45.480
OK... Go!

46:54.960 --> 46:56.720
Hey!

47:14.200 --> 47:16.800
Come on. You're OK.
You're OK. It's all right.

47:18.640 --> 47:22.840
-I thought you said
you could swim?
-Yeah... in space.

47:22.840 --> 47:24.400
Welcome to Earth.

47:27.680 --> 47:31.360
I would've been OK, ya know. You
just never gave me the chance.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.560
Hold it over the flame more,
it needs to be hotter.

47:48.560 --> 47:50.040
A little more.

47:58.520 --> 47:59.680
(SCREAMING)

48:10.160 --> 48:12.600
I did exactly
what you said to do.

48:12.600 --> 48:14.880
I heated it
to 250 degrees Celsius.

48:16.400 --> 48:20.280
Down here we're still
using Fahrenheit.

48:20.280 --> 48:22.760
MARGIE: So, you made it
twice as hot?

48:41.440 --> 48:43.520
One seventy-five, please.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.160
One-seventy-five what?

48:45.160 --> 48:47.680
Oh, money.
You must mean money.

48:49.200 --> 48:51.640
Where she comes from,
they don't have cash.

48:51.640 --> 48:55.120
Yeah, we just barter with moon
rocks and alien skulls.

48:55.120 --> 48:56.840
I'll pay you back.

48:56.840 --> 49:00.320
You know, the truth is,
I think it's pretty macro
you grew up in space.

49:00.320 --> 49:04.040
Yeah? Well, I think it's "macro"
you grew up here on Earth.

49:04.040 --> 49:06.520
No, no, no. Go easy.
"Macro" is a good thing.

49:06.520 --> 49:10.240
"Micro" is bad.
"Viral" is nasty.

49:10.240 --> 49:12.320
-"Graphic" is beautiful.
-Excuse me.

49:12.320 --> 49:15.880
But I studied my schedule
and nowhere on it does it say
anything

49:15.880 --> 49:18.160
about taking
a foreign language.

49:24.800 --> 49:26.960
"Forget about Wyndham,"
Nebula says.

49:26.960 --> 49:29.280
"Who cares if he's
up to something inky?"

49:29.280 --> 49:33.040
Do I listen?
Do I ever? Oh, no.

49:34.560 --> 49:36.960
-You heard about
that concert in space?
-Yeah.

49:36.960 --> 49:39.480
One girl gets to dance
with Proto Zoa?

49:39.480 --> 49:43.320
Did anybody tell you that,
that lucky girl was supposed
to be me?

49:43.320 --> 49:46.280
No lie?
You won that contest?

49:46.280 --> 49:50.600
Uh-huh. But will I be there for
my Glory Moment Major? Negative.

49:50.600 --> 49:54.280
I'll be here getting blown up
and drowned in a torture chamber

49:54.280 --> 49:57.280
people call school because I
couldn't mind my own business.

49:57.280 --> 50:00.800
Would it make any difference
if there was some lesson you
could learn?

50:00.800 --> 50:03.840
Something about the dangers
of jumping to conclusions?

50:03.840 --> 50:06.480
No. Because I still fully
believe I was right!

50:06.480 --> 50:10.120
If you could have just seen
that look Lutz gave me before
I left them.

50:10.120 --> 50:14.520
OK then, would it make any sense
to go and discuss this with
Parker Wyndham?

50:14.520 --> 50:18.200
Cetus-Lupeedus, no! Whatever's
going on up in that space-stay,

50:18.200 --> 50:21.440
he and Lutz are in it together.
I can feel it.

50:21.440 --> 50:23.840
JUDY: Wait.
Why is my door open?

50:42.240 --> 50:44.840
Nothing like this
has happened to me before.

50:44.840 --> 50:46.200
I understand.

50:46.200 --> 50:48.960
Anyways, thank you
for everything, Officer.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.680
-Uh-huh.
-I hope you find him.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.720
And lock the door
on your way out.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.760
You bet.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.240
Well, this place
is really turning out to be

50:57.240 --> 51:00.080
everything your mother
warned you about, isn't it?

51:00.080 --> 51:02.160
Not a lot of crime in space,
I'll bet.

51:02.160 --> 51:04.160
Nowhere for the bad guys
to run to.

51:06.200 --> 51:09.520
You know, the oddest thing is,
none of my stuff seems to be
missing.

51:09.520 --> 51:11.080
What about you?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.480
It's all here.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.000
I don't buy
this random break-in stuff.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.680
It was and Lutz and Wyndham.

51:17.680 --> 51:19.840
What would they
be looking for?

51:37.520 --> 51:38.840
(SCREAMS)

51:59.880 --> 52:02.560
So, guess you're surviving?

52:03.400 --> 52:04.680
Barely.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.200
Look, this is Difficult Major
for me,

52:07.200 --> 52:10.040
but I have this situation
I'm dealing with,

52:10.040 --> 52:12.320
and I could fully
use a little help.

52:12.320 --> 52:16.600
Last time I tried to help you,
I nearly got whiplash from the
verbal assault.

52:16.600 --> 52:21.280
Well, obviously, your life is
so lunarious you can't relate.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.000
But I was having
a very bad day.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.400
I'm sorry.

52:27.400 --> 52:30.360
Look, I'd like to help, but
I can't. I'm on my way out.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.400
I work at a stable.
You know, with horses.

52:37.400 --> 52:41.200
It's kind of cool.
Do you want to check it out?

52:42.960 --> 52:44.200
No, thanks.

52:44.200 --> 52:45.640
Suit yourself.

52:51.760 --> 52:53.480
Real horses?

52:59.840 --> 53:02.280
Does it always smell
like this around here?

53:02.280 --> 53:04.320
Yeah. It's great,
isn't it?

53:04.320 --> 53:07.120
That's not exactly the word
I would have picked.

53:09.680 --> 53:10.960
Cetus-Lupeedus!

53:10.960 --> 53:12.480
Pretty alpha, huh?

53:12.480 --> 53:14.560
Pretty... humongous.

53:15.840 --> 53:18.320
You're not scared of them,
are you?

53:18.320 --> 53:20.720
Me? No. Of course not.

53:20.720 --> 53:23.600
He's going to stay
in his little box, isn't he?

53:23.600 --> 53:25.800
Sure. Until I let him out.

53:25.800 --> 53:28.240
Out? Why would you want
to let him out?

53:28.240 --> 53:30.360
I thought
you weren't scared?

53:30.360 --> 53:34.520
I'm not. I just think he looks
very content where he is.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.520
This is Pogo. I'm going
to bring him out and brush him
now, all right?

53:56.920 --> 53:58.320
(WHINNYING)

54:04.480 --> 54:06.160
See how mellow he is?

54:09.680 --> 54:10.920
I think he likes you.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.400
Wanna give it a try?

54:20.680 --> 54:22.000
Not like that.

54:23.600 --> 54:24.960
Come on.

54:24.960 --> 54:26.520
Come on.

54:31.040 --> 54:32.480
Like this.

54:39.120 --> 54:40.880
It's not so scary,
is it?

54:45.960 --> 54:47.280
You want to ride him?

54:54.120 --> 54:56.800
Oh no. I can't do this.
Mistake Major.

54:56.800 --> 54:59.200
Just swing your leg over.
You'll be all right.

55:08.400 --> 55:10.240
I'm up. I did it!

55:10.240 --> 55:12.600
Cetus-Lupeedus,
it's so high.

55:13.400 --> 55:14.800
Ready?

55:14.800 --> 55:16.440
Go, Pogo.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.600
(LAUGHING)

55:47.320 --> 55:49.600
I've never seen an ocean.

55:56.960 --> 55:58.880
It was so beautiful
out there.

55:58.880 --> 56:02.240
Yeah. So, your Aunt Judy said it
was OK for you to go to dinner?

56:02.240 --> 56:03.720
Roger that.

56:03.720 --> 56:06.560
Now, riding a bike is something
you do know how to do, right?

56:06.560 --> 56:10.480
Greg, practically our whole
space-stay gym is made up
of bikes.

56:13.240 --> 56:14.400
(CRASHING)

56:16.160 --> 56:20.560
Did I mention that
those were stationary bikes?

56:23.040 --> 56:25.880
(POP MUSIC PLAYING)

56:27.160 --> 56:28.760
Stellar!

56:28.760 --> 56:31.920
A food that gives a whole new
meaning to the term "O-rings".

56:33.200 --> 56:36.880
Oh, hot, hot!
But good. So good.

56:36.880 --> 56:38.960
-OK, what else can we order?
-Whoa.

56:39.560 --> 56:42.880
Slow down. I said I'd buy you
dinner, not 10 dinners.

56:42.880 --> 56:46.680
I know but I can't stop.
It all tastes so fully illegal.

56:47.160 --> 56:50.040
Considering how many horses
I'm gonna have to groom
to pay for tonight,

56:50.440 --> 56:52.640
I'm glad to know
you're loving it.

56:52.640 --> 56:53.800
I am.

56:56.440 --> 57:00.400
See, in space we can only eat
what we can cultivate.

57:01.200 --> 57:05.480
Cows and little piggies
definitely don't make the cut.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.280
None of that bothers you?

57:08.240 --> 57:09.800
It's home, Greg.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.800
I've lived there
since I was a little kid.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.480
-Cetus-Lupeedus!
-What?

57:16.600 --> 57:18.520
Lutz... where did he go?

57:18.520 --> 57:20.560
-Who?
-Lutz, I said. I saw him.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.040
He was staring at me.

57:22.040 --> 57:24.360
The guy that works for
the WyndComm guy? You sure?

57:24.360 --> 57:27.840
Mondo-sure. Come on, Greg.
Time for Evasion Mode Major.

57:29.760 --> 57:30.920
Check!

57:35.760 --> 57:37.640
Oh! Could my legs
be any whiter?

57:38.640 --> 57:40.400
They like glow-in-the-dark.

57:41.720 --> 57:42.880
They're fine.

57:45.720 --> 57:47.440
Is it OK to...?

57:47.440 --> 57:49.280
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

57:50.920 --> 57:52.680
(GASPS)

57:52.680 --> 57:54.280
It's freezing.

57:54.280 --> 57:56.800
-Well, what did you expect?
-I don't know.

57:56.800 --> 58:02.120
Everything here is so...
different from what
I thought it would be.

58:05.320 --> 58:10.800
To me, your whole planet's
just one big Mystery Extreme.

58:10.800 --> 58:12.920
(ELECTRONIC BEEPING)

58:12.920 --> 58:15.320
Speaking of mysteries,
from what I can see,

58:15.320 --> 58:18.840
the whole WyndComm operation's
not nearly as Midas as it used
to be.

58:18.840 --> 58:22.840
-What did you uncover?
-Financial forms,
confidential memos.

58:22.840 --> 58:25.120
You hacked into
their internal data bank?

58:25.120 --> 58:27.240
Without breaking a sweat.

58:27.240 --> 58:28.680
Stellar!

58:31.280 --> 58:35.360
So, why would Wyndham promise
the space-stay more money

58:35.360 --> 58:36.960
if he didn't have it?

58:37.960 --> 58:41.320
That's the alpha question,
isn't it?

58:41.320 --> 58:44.320
All right, tell me again
the weird look Lutz gave you.

58:44.320 --> 58:46.000
We went through this already.

58:47.200 --> 58:48.800
OK. I put my luggage down

58:48.800 --> 58:51.880
and I told Wyndham that he
didn't fool me for a minute.

58:51.880 --> 58:55.120
Then I picked up my luggage
and I turned away.

58:55.120 --> 58:57.000
Were you wearing that?

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
-Aunt Judy bought me this.
-Not the shirt, the earring.

59:00.000 --> 59:02.360
-Yeah.
-Well, maybe that's it!

59:02.360 --> 59:05.640
If Lutz was acting generic
until you tucked back your hair,

59:05.640 --> 59:07.520
maybe he was reacting
to the disk.

59:07.520 --> 59:11.640
Cetus-Lupeedus! Lutz had a disk!
In the Main Memory Bank.

59:11.640 --> 59:14.720
I don't know if he put something
on it or took something off,

59:14.720 --> 59:16.360
but he definitely
had a disk.

59:21.200 --> 59:23.520
-Will you quit wiggling?
-I can't help it.

59:23.520 --> 59:27.120
One more block and my butt's
gonna be ready for the discard
bin.

59:27.120 --> 59:29.080
(THUNDERCLAP)

59:33.840 --> 59:37.880
-What's that? What's happening?
-Zenon, it's OK.
It's just rain.

59:38.920 --> 59:40.040
Rain?

59:41.920 --> 59:43.400
Rain.

59:44.160 --> 59:45.840
I remember this.

59:45.840 --> 59:50.000
When I was real little, getting
caught in a summer storm.

59:55.600 --> 59:58.480
Wow, you don't
get out much, do you?

59:58.480 --> 59:59.920
Uh-uh.

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:04.440
I had an alpha time tonight.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.320
Yeah. Me, too.

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:13.480
I'd, uh, better get inside.

1:00:13.480 --> 1:00:17.360
Yeah. First thing tomorrow
morning, we gotta get over
to Andrew's

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:21.000
to see if we can figure out
what's on this earring.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:23.680
See you there.

1:00:36.440 --> 1:00:37.720
Come here.

1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:42.080
You know what?
You've only been here five days

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.680
and already you're having better
luck with guys than I ever have.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.880
BOY: I've never seen a disk
like this one.

1:00:48.880 --> 1:00:50.760
(GROANING)

1:00:50.760 --> 1:00:52.600
Come on. Come on.

1:00:57.040 --> 1:01:00.280
Gregory, are you gonna
do this all day?

1:01:00.280 --> 1:01:01.800
Probably.

1:01:01.800 --> 1:01:03.960
But it's so boring!

1:01:03.960 --> 1:01:07.120
Don't you want to go for a ride
with me in my dad's hover limo?

1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:08.480
No, thanks.

1:01:08.480 --> 1:01:10.640
You always used to like
riding with me,

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:15.040
before she dropped out of the
sky like a ton of space junk.

BOY: Reality pill, Margie.

1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:22.560
It was never you he liked,
it was the car.

Why can't I get into this thing?

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:30.480
GREG: You'll get it.
Keep trying.

1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:39.040
You know, a very close friend
of my father's works for IMC,

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:41.160
and I was thinking,

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:44.560
isn't it only fair to let them
know that their contest winner

1:01:44.560 --> 1:01:47.320
won't be around
for her big dance?

1:01:47.320 --> 1:01:49.920
I'm gonna be back
there in time.

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:51.960
The concert
is next weekend, Zenon.

1:01:51.960 --> 1:01:55.800
Do you really think your parents
are gonna forgive and forget
that fast?

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:58.840
-I don't see
why this is your business.
-It's not.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:01.400
My business is keeping you
away from Gregory.

1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:04.520
-He's helping me
with a Problem Major.
-That better be all.

1:02:04.520 --> 1:02:07.680
Or I'll sprint to that
view-phone and tell those
Microbe folks

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:09.680
that they need
to pick a replacement.

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:12.440
Because the girl they thought
was a winner is nothing

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:16.360
but a stranded-on-Earth

Oh, man!

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:12.880
It's a highly sophisticated,
untraceable nano-virus

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:15.880

to replicate inside a system

1:03:15.880 --> 1:03:19.160
until the entire hard drive
crashes down and self-destructs.

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:21.360
Cetus-Lupeedus,
are you sure?

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.360
Considering the hunk of melted
junk that now sits where my
computer used to be,

1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:27.040
I'm very sure.

1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:32.160
Fortunately, after several hours
of highly-skilled maneuvers,

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:35.480
I have managed to refashion
this program into an "undo" file

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:37.240
that should remove the bugs

1:03:37.240 --> 1:03:39.840
from whatever system
they've been introduced to.

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:41.320
Can you guarantee that?

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:44.040
Nothing can ever be guaranteed
until it's...

1:03:44.040 --> 1:03:45.800
...well, put to the test.

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:49.720
Here. But to put it there,
we would have to get it there.

1:03:49.720 --> 1:03:51.480
That's a problem?

1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:54.920
She's talking about the Main
Computer on the space station.

1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:57.520
OK, if everything you're saying
is true, Andrew,

1:03:57.520 --> 1:03:59.800
how come it hasn't
come crashing down?

1:03:59.800 --> 1:04:03.360
The system your space station
has must be incredibly powerful.

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:05.840
So, you mean,
Wyndham's bugs might not work?

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:08.240
Oh, no,
they'll work big time.

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:10.920
They just might
take a little longer to do it.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.640
Let's go.

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:16.680
Go? Go where?
School's about to start.

1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:20.280
Not for me. My parents
are in Jeopardy Major!

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.080
You go.

1:04:32.760 --> 1:04:35.160
<i>I can't believe you think</i>
<i>I'm making this up!</i>

1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:39.360
I, more than anyone, understand
how traumatic Earth can be.

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:42.560
But you haven't given yourself
time to adjust.

1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:45.680
I still cannot regulate the
oxygen flow to the rat cages.

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:47.440
I can't seem
to find the glitch.

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:49.760
The entire experiment
is hinging on this.

-I know. I know.

1:04:51.280 --> 1:04:54.560

1:04:54.560 --> 1:04:58.520

1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:06.520
Would you mind telling me

1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:09.240
why Wyndham would want to
destroy his own space station?

1:05:09.240 --> 1:05:12.720
For, for money? I don't know.
I only know he is!

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:18.760
This isn't about Microbe,

1:05:18.760 --> 1:05:21.440
It isn't about having learned
a lesson down there!

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:37.320
Nothing, Zenon.
It's business as usual.

what that disk contains?

It's just a bunch
of boring corporate records

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.480
that wouldn't mean anything
to you, but are valuable
to Mr. Wyndham.

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:49.280
Meaning...

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:53.360
...that you'll be in Trouble

-What do you want, cash?

-To the space station.
-For crying out loud!

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:10.400
-How am I supposed
to arrange that?
