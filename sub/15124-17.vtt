WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:04.438
(fly buzzing)

00:14.148 --> 00:15.249
Come on, buddy.

00:15.283 --> 00:16.684
It doesn't
have to end badly.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.120
Just trying
to get you out safe.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.689
(buzzing)

00:21.722 --> 00:23.157
Ah...

00:25.093 --> 00:27.228
Are you still trying
to catch that fly?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.529
Just kill it.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.564
Flies carry
deadly diseases.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.200
Why do you think there's
a "no-fly zone"

00:32.233 --> 00:34.268
over the White House?
I can't kill it.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.836
It's the one thing
I've got.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.371
Nobody else
in high school

00:37.405 --> 00:39.107
lived up to
their potential.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.608
Kevin Kinlan, voted
"Most likely to succeed"?

00:40.641 --> 00:42.343
In prison for embezzlement.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.212
John Zachary, voted
"Most athletic"?

00:44.245 --> 00:45.679
Now he weighs 400 pounds.

00:45.713 --> 00:48.082
He hasn't seen his feet or
his penis since the '90s.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.551
I was the guy voted
"Least likely to hurt a fly."

00:50.584 --> 00:52.420
I'm not going to blow it

00:52.453 --> 00:55.223
and wind up like
the rest of those losers.

00:55.256 --> 00:58.459
Oh, and those awards
mean so much.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.761
I was voted "Most sarcastic."

01:00.794 --> 01:02.630
Those geniuses
really nailed that one.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.399
I got him!

01:05.433 --> 01:08.169
Virginia, I got him!
(fly buzzing)

01:08.202 --> 01:09.370
Go home.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.272
Hug your wife
and kiss your maggots.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.806
Today you live!

01:14.675 --> 01:16.244
No!

01:16.277 --> 01:17.811
Wow.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.781
That is gonna be a
slow, slow death.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.252
Whoo!

01:24.285 --> 01:25.553
* Here we go

01:25.586 --> 01:28.489
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:34.428 --> 01:35.796
(school bell ringing)

01:35.829 --> 01:37.565
Wait, wait, wait! Don't!

01:37.598 --> 01:39.800
Hey, don't...
Oh... (moans)

01:40.768 --> 01:42.803
(groans)

01:44.172 --> 01:45.406
(screams)
Who is she?!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.275
Who is who?!

01:47.308 --> 01:48.509
And where did you
get that golf club?

01:48.542 --> 01:50.311
We don't even golf!
I got it

01:50.344 --> 01:51.679
in case you ever
Tiger Woods'd me.
No,

01:51.712 --> 01:52.813
I was sleepwalking, all right?

01:52.846 --> 01:54.282
I used to sleepwalk as a kid

01:54.315 --> 01:56.184
when-when I slept
in strange places,

01:56.217 --> 01:58.319
and now it's-it's
happening again.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.697
(engine running)

02:23.344 --> 02:24.144
Oh, Jimmy, that's terrible.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.946
We got to figure out
how to fix this.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.348
What did your parents do?

02:27.381 --> 02:28.816
They got me a dog collar

02:28.849 --> 02:30.351
and put all my information
on the tag.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.386
Of course. The store
must have been out of leeches.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.555
No, no, we got all our leeches
from a guy my dad knows,

02:34.588 --> 02:36.390
and I'm pretty sure
they only work on chicken pox.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.832
(microwave running)

02:45.899 --> 02:47.368
Oh.

02:47.401 --> 02:48.969
The door to the microwave broke.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.371
BURT:
Here.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.241
Oh.
I think we need to buy
a new microwave.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.375
No, no. It's okay.
I think I have

02:54.408 --> 02:55.809
a microwave in
all my stuff.

02:55.843 --> 02:56.877
It doesn't work,
but the door's still on.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.412
We can just swap it out.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.381
All your stuff?
You got rid of all your stuff

03:00.414 --> 03:02.216
when you stopped hoarding.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.451
You told me
you stopped hoarding.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.587
I did.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.556
Tell you that.

03:08.589 --> 03:11.725
I can't believe you lied and
told me you stopped hoarding.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.661
I haven't gambled once
since I quit.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.264
I bet you $1,000
there's a bunch of other stuff

03:16.297 --> 03:17.998
you're not telling me.
Why is this open?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.600
Seriously. I bet you.
Right now.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
Step away from the locker!

03:21.635 --> 03:23.771
No, no, it's okay.
This is our stuff.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.573
Not anymore.
You didn't pay your rent.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.007
We're just airing out
the contents

03:27.040 --> 03:28.676
before we put it up for auction.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.777
Hold on there.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.445
A working grandmother

03:31.479 --> 03:33.381
goes without paying
for 24 months

03:33.414 --> 03:35.416
and you just take
all her stuff?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.417
Romney!

03:36.450 --> 03:38.752
He lost, Burt.
Obama!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.588
I don't know what to tell you.
If you want your stuff back,

03:40.621 --> 03:43.857
you owe $700. Other than that,
it goes to the highest bidder.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.359
VIRGINIA:
Hey! Hey!

03:45.393 --> 03:47.395
Just because you have
every right to take our stuff

03:47.428 --> 03:49.029
and I don't have
any argument against it

03:49.062 --> 03:52.433
doesn't mean I'm done
talking to you, buddy!

03:52.466 --> 03:55.769
Excuse me. If we could
just talk about this...

03:55.803 --> 03:57.471
(whispers):
Oh, my God, look.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.639
It's Creepy the Clown.

04:00.908 --> 04:03.477
VIRGINIA:
Years ago, we had
a creepy clown doll

04:03.511 --> 04:05.346
that used to freak Jimmy out.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.880
BURT (gruffly):
Jimmy.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.482
(cackles)

04:08.516 --> 04:10.484
(screams)

04:11.652 --> 04:13.287
(laughing)

04:13.321 --> 04:15.356
(thunder rumbling)

04:25.433 --> 04:29.470
(screaming)

04:29.503 --> 04:32.906
We didn't just torture Jimmy
with it.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.042
We also used it
to keep him out of danger.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.581
(screams)

04:40.614 --> 04:43.484
And while some things
could shock him for a second,

04:43.517 --> 04:46.354
other things could
scar him for life.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
whoa, whoa.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.394
We don't have the money
for that much therapy.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.798
So we needed to hide
the tape in a place

04:57.831 --> 05:00.734
we knew Jimmy
would never look.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.005
(whistles)

05:06.374 --> 05:08.409
It was a perfect hiding place

05:08.442 --> 05:10.411
until Maw Maw decided
to donate stuff

05:10.444 --> 05:12.346
to the church rummage sale.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.881
And that was the last time

05:13.914 --> 05:16.884
we ever saw
that creepy-looking clown.

05:19.487 --> 05:22.356
(zapping)
Ouch! Ouch!

05:22.390 --> 05:24.392
Is this unit up for auction?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.527
They're all up
for bid Saturday morning.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.498
We've got to get our sex tape
out of that clown's ass.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.866
I bet nobody's ever said
that before.

05:36.604 --> 05:38.672
JIMMY:
You ready?
Yeah.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.874
(voices speaking indistinctly
on television)

05:40.908 --> 05:42.910
What do you think?
I think

05:42.943 --> 05:44.845
America's about to elect
a terrorist as a vice president

05:44.878 --> 05:47.481
if somebody doesn't start
listening to Claire Danes.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.482
Oh,

05:48.516 --> 05:50.518
you mean your sleep apnea mask.

05:50.551 --> 05:51.885
If it prevents you
from sleepwalking,

05:51.919 --> 05:53.421
I think it's great.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.055
I think I look
like a fighter pilot.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.490
You get to pretend
you're sleeping

05:56.524 --> 05:57.758
with Tom Cruise tonight.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.427
Ooh. Okay.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.094
Maybe get into a little
"risky business."

06:01.128 --> 06:03.531
Can I prevent you from
ruining my Homeland marathon

06:03.564 --> 06:05.433
by making bad Tom Cruise
references all night?

06:05.466 --> 06:06.734
That's a "mission impossible."

06:08.135 --> 06:10.771
Get ready for "the firm."

06:10.804 --> 06:12.906
'Cause I'm about
to make it "rain...

06:12.940 --> 06:14.442
...man."

06:14.475 --> 06:15.443
(groans)

06:15.476 --> 06:17.545
(birds chirping)

06:21.949 --> 06:25.018
Aw, not again!

06:25.052 --> 06:28.188
(sighs)

06:28.221 --> 06:29.389
Yo!

06:35.829 --> 06:37.030
What are you doing?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.432
The guy at
the storage space

06:38.466 --> 06:40.801
said those auctions go up
to 500 bucks.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.069
So if we want to get

06:42.102 --> 06:43.070
our sex tape back,

06:43.103 --> 06:44.572
we need to make some quick cash,

06:44.605 --> 06:46.139
and I'm willing to try anything.

06:46.173 --> 06:49.109
Which is something whoever gets
that tape is gonna find out.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.711
But you can't sell the van.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.113
Why not? Jimmy and Sabrina
have a new car.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.483
I have a car,
you have your work truck.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.652
Maw Maw won this scooter in
a poker game with Mrs. Peables.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.888
Even after the stroke,
she still doesn't have

07:00.921 --> 07:03.791
much of a poker face.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.959
I know we don't need
the van, but...

07:05.993 --> 07:07.995
it's like a part
of the family.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.230
It has so many
special memories.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.467
* Through the years
(creaking)

07:13.501 --> 07:16.904
* You've never let me down

07:16.937 --> 07:20.140
* You turned my life around

07:20.173 --> 07:21.742
(chuckles)

07:21.775 --> 07:23.611
If there was a Tongue
Hall of Fame, Burt,

07:23.644 --> 07:24.512
you'd be in it.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.680
And-and if there was
a Tongue Nobel Prize,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.482
you'd have
a whole shelf full.

07:28.516 --> 07:29.850
(chuckling)

07:29.883 --> 07:31.919
Ah, that's it!

07:31.952 --> 07:34.187
I can't listen
to this tape anymore.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.122
It's been stuck

07:35.155 --> 07:37.558
in there since I bought the van.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.759
Ah.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.561
(grunts)

07:47.801 --> 07:49.837
Not again.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.210
I can't do it.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.979
We're not selling the van.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.548
You're gonna have to find
something else to sell.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.217
BARNEY:
Hmm, clarity in the hooves.

08:04.251 --> 08:06.987
Perfectly symmetrical
snout holes.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.891
Only the tiny hands
of a scared Chinese child

08:10.924 --> 08:13.160
can achieve that craftsmanship.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.596
But I don't see the one
you know I want.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.864
I brought you everything I have.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.532
This is all I've got.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.200
I've been to your house,
Virginia.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.735
I want your Swiney Todd,

08:21.769 --> 08:23.236
the Demon Butcher
of Meat Street,

08:23.270 --> 08:25.038
wanted for multiple ham-icides.

08:25.072 --> 08:28.576
The worst-selling character
in Pigurine history, and thus...

08:28.609 --> 08:29.943
the rarest.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.013
(groans)
Fine.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.984
I'll sell it to you.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.318
But just so you know,

08:38.351 --> 08:41.088
I consider this
highway hoggery.

08:43.957 --> 08:47.327
H-Hoggery. (laughs)
I got it. I got it.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.597
(laughs)

08:49.630 --> 08:51.298
I just came up with that.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.636
Where you been?

08:55.669 --> 08:58.271
(quietly): Operation Steal
Our Microwave Door successful.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.608
All right, we're gonna start
the bidding at five dollars.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.643
I got five right there.
Anybody with six?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.277
Six!
Six dollars. Can I get seven?

09:04.311 --> 09:05.746
Seven!
Seven, I got seven. I got seven.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.948
$20!
$20! Right over there, $20...

09:07.981 --> 09:09.783
Frank, what the hell?

09:09.817 --> 09:11.218
Look, I don't know
why you want this locker,

09:11.251 --> 09:12.886
but I'll make you a deal. 21!

09:12.920 --> 09:14.622
You let us win this locker,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.590
we'll give you everything inside
except for that

09:16.624 --> 09:18.659
cute little clown doll for Hope.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.060
You can keep the doll,

09:20.093 --> 09:23.130
but I get to keep
the sex tape inside.

09:24.732 --> 09:26.233
Oh, I know.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.672
What's going on there?

09:31.705 --> 09:33.073
Yeah, my mom's selling
some of her Pigurines

09:33.106 --> 09:35.609
to bid on a storage unit
that has her sex tape in it.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.913
$100!
I got $100 right there!

09:39.947 --> 09:41.782
$125!
(man shouts)

09:41.815 --> 09:43.116
$200!
$300!

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
$400!
$400 right there!

09:44.952 --> 09:47.287
What?
I know how much Jimmy makes
at the grocery store.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.089
Where'd you get
that kind of money?
I won 800 bucks

09:49.122 --> 09:51.659
coming in second place
at a demolition derby.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.126
My Pacer is totaled.

09:53.160 --> 09:56.730
Look. If you care about me
as a friend at all...

09:56.764 --> 09:58.732
$450! You won't do this.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.768
Okay, fine.
I'll make you a deal.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.670
$475! You can keep the tape,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.137
but I would like to rent it
on occasion.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.906
$480! Okay, but just once.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.308
$485! Go on.

10:08.341 --> 10:09.242
You have to watch it
at our house,

10:09.276 --> 10:11.779
and you have to keep
your pants on. $490!

10:11.812 --> 10:14.782
No rewinds, no copies,
no pauses.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.785
$495! One pause,
eight seconds long.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.352
Fine!
Deal!

10:19.386 --> 10:22.923
$500!
$500! $500 going once...

10:22.956 --> 10:24.658
$500 going twice...

10:24.692 --> 10:27.728
sold, $500! Come on in.
Yes!

10:27.761 --> 10:29.697
(chuckles)

10:30.798 --> 10:33.333
What? There's no hole!

10:33.366 --> 10:35.002
Oh, my God!

10:35.035 --> 10:38.138
I just sold my Pigurines
and blew $500

10:38.171 --> 10:41.675
on the wrong stuffed clown that
doesn't have our sex tape in it.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.143
Don't beat yourself up
about it.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.779
I'm sure this happens
to people all the time.
(groans)

10:45.813 --> 10:47.681
God.
(whimpers)

10:51.218 --> 10:55.689
JIMMY: (grunting)
I don't know if exercising
is gonna be the answer

10:55.723 --> 10:59.760
to my sleepwalking, and plus,
I kind of feel ridiculous.

10:59.793 --> 11:02.029
SABRINA:
Yeah, well, last night
you walked through town

11:02.062 --> 11:04.765
in your boxer shorts
and my fuzzy slippers, so...

11:04.798 --> 11:06.333
I think this is worth a shot.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.769
Hey.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.303
Either your parents
are having a yard sale,

11:10.337 --> 11:12.005
or your house
finally threw up.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.841
Yeah, talk about a lot
of stuff I don't need.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.242
I already got
the wolf blanket,

11:15.275 --> 11:16.744
I got that same
bikini poster girl...

11:16.777 --> 11:18.345
Wait a second.
What are you guys doing?

11:18.378 --> 11:19.847
Oh, your mother's
having a yard sale

11:19.880 --> 11:21.014
so she can buy back
her Pigurines.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.215
I'm selling all
the stuff we got

11:22.249 --> 11:23.717
from that storage unit
we won

11:23.751 --> 11:24.718
along with some
of your crap.

11:24.752 --> 11:27.755
You just can't
sell my stuff!

11:27.788 --> 11:31.058
This is 100% authentic
bathtub gin

11:31.091 --> 11:34.361
passed down to me by
my great aunt, Blind Lizzy,

11:34.394 --> 11:37.164
to her daughter, Blind Betty,
and then finally her sons,

11:37.197 --> 11:41.268
Blind Barry and Sightless Sam,
who spoke the recipe to me.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.003
Ten bucks a jar,

11:43.036 --> 11:45.172
'cause this is probably
the last batch I can make

11:45.205 --> 11:47.507
'cause my eyes aren't
what they used to be.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.876
Thank you.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.343
How much for this photo album?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.378
Two dollars.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.080
I don't want the pictures.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.782
Looking at other people's
memories makes me sad.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.049
Sorry. We got this stuff

11:56.083 --> 11:58.018
from somebody else's
storage space.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.888
Huh. That's actually a
pretty cute baby right there.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.222
Wow, what a happy family.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.925
He looks so peaceful
sleeping in his bassinet.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.060
Hey... it's that one
right there.

12:09.462 --> 12:12.399
And there he is learning
to ride that bike!

12:13.801 --> 12:15.135
Are you gonna
sell me the book

12:15.168 --> 12:16.303
or narrate every photo?

12:16.336 --> 12:18.772
This album's not for sale.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.240
There's a family out there

12:20.273 --> 12:22.142
who would love to have
these wonderful memories.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.477
You can go buy some of my
son's crap over there.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.313
What are you doing?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.816
Virginia, we can't sell
this stuff. It's not ours.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.818
The people in these pictures
are gonna want it back.

12:30.851 --> 12:33.921
This is the history of their
courtship and their marriage...

12:33.954 --> 12:35.989
and their underwater birth.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.825
Oh, scratch that.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.326
They're just went snorkeling
with a baby sea otter.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.261
Well, I need money
to get my Pigurines back.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.831
Fine. I'll sell the van.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.472
Well, the shocks still work.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.274
(sighing)

12:54.307 --> 12:56.977
Now all I need is some
good-looking friends
and a talking dog

12:57.010 --> 13:00.047
and my mystery-solving
business is up and running.

13:02.983 --> 13:05.152
(choking):
I'm gonna miss her.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.820
If you want,
I can pick you up

13:06.854 --> 13:08.321
every now and then
and take you for a ride.

13:08.355 --> 13:11.825
No. I think that'll just
confuse the van.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.407
(quietly):
Jimmy?

14:03.944 --> 14:05.478
(sighing)

14:05.512 --> 14:07.948
I can't believe you sold
the van for strangers,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.317
but when I wanted to get the
tape back to keep my dignity,

14:10.350 --> 14:11.651
you wouldn't even listen.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.153
I only sold it to
help you buy back

14:13.186 --> 14:14.922
your precious Pigurines.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.656
I told you that, but you
don't listen to me.

14:16.689 --> 14:17.925
I don't listen to you?

14:17.958 --> 14:18.992
You don't listen to me.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.894
I'm not listening to this.

14:23.931 --> 14:25.398
Hey.
Hi.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.534
We found a bunch of mail
with this address on it

14:27.567 --> 14:29.402
in an old storage unit and
we're trying to find out

14:29.436 --> 14:31.071
who it belongs to so we can
return all their stuff.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.506
Burt! Virginia!
I know who you are.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.076
Christine, get over here!

14:36.109 --> 14:38.045
Hi.

14:38.078 --> 14:38.912
Oh.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.114
It's Burt and Virginia.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.916
How do you know us?

14:42.950 --> 14:45.085
From your sex tape.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.588
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

14:48.621 --> 14:51.091
That's exactly how she
says it on the tape!
I know!

15:01.034 --> 15:02.569
(slight snicker)

15:02.602 --> 15:04.004
(whispering):
I know.

15:06.439 --> 15:07.941
Burt, I almost didn't
recognize you

15:07.975 --> 15:10.077
with your contemporary
hairstyle.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.980
Virginia, have you kept up with
contemporary grooming trends?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.647
I'm a little uncomfortable

15:14.681 --> 15:17.317
with how comfortable
you two are with us.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.419
Oh, no, it's just that
we've seen your tape

15:19.452 --> 15:21.021
like, a thousand times.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.391
Yeah, you said that...
like, 2,000 times.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.426
I remember the day we got it.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.295
We were getting ready to move

15:28.328 --> 15:30.230
into my brother-in-law's
guest house

15:30.263 --> 15:32.265
and we bought a bunch of things
at the church rummage sale,

15:32.299 --> 15:35.602
but we got more
than we paid for.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.140
I wasn't really
a sex tape kind of guy,

15:40.173 --> 15:41.741
but we'd been fighting
and I thought,

15:41.774 --> 15:44.277
hey, this might
shake us out of our rut.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.618
I've never seen
anything like this.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.121
Why don't we ever role play
as a maid and a yard guy

15:54.154 --> 15:56.223
doing it in an old
haunted house?

15:59.159 --> 16:00.427
Your tape was heaven-sent.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.329
We watched it almost
every night.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.164
Yeah, we even started showing it
to our sons, Dominic and Logan.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.532
What?!

16:05.565 --> 16:06.699
I hope,
for your kids' sake,

16:06.733 --> 16:08.001
they're blind and deaf.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.269
Oh, no. It's not like that.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.005
No, Jimmy, um, edited out
all the sex parts.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.440
You guys had such
an amazing relationship

16:13.473 --> 16:15.275
that we took a triple-X
and made it into a "G"

16:15.308 --> 16:18.078
so we could use it as a
teaching tool for relationships.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.112
Check it out.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.581
NARRATOR:
Compassion.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.384
(fly buzzing)
Oh, no, no, Burt.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.686
It flew over
back by the door.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.655
Come here, buddy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.023
It's all about
catch and release.

16:30.057 --> 16:33.026
(grunting):
Come... aww...

16:33.060 --> 16:35.062
(murmuring):
Come here.

16:35.095 --> 16:38.031
I got him! I got him!

16:41.768 --> 16:43.103
I love how nice you are

16:43.136 --> 16:44.571
to all of God's
creatures.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.373
I could never
hurt a fly.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.042
NARRATOR:
Understanding.

16:49.076 --> 16:53.046
(panting, sighing)

16:53.080 --> 16:55.348
You got, like,
12 alarm clocks
under the bed.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.317
I don't know.

16:57.350 --> 17:01.121
I just keep buying them
just in case.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.689
You don't think
I'm, like,

17:02.722 --> 17:05.392
one of those crazy
hoarders, do you?

17:05.425 --> 17:06.593
No.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.196
No, you're just
being prepared.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.364
I imagine one day, one of us
is going to have a job

17:11.398 --> 17:14.534
that'll require us
to be somewhere on time.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.336
NARRATOR:
Listening.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.071
I think it's your
turn to start

17:18.105 --> 17:19.839
'cause I ripped off your
clothes last time.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.441
Oh, speaking of rip-offs,

17:21.474 --> 17:23.543
the Johnsons told me they want
to change landscapers today

17:23.576 --> 17:26.113
after I trimmed
all their trees.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.515
I spent hours trying
to nail the branches back on,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.450
then I just gave up,
and I peed in the pool.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.520
Oh, it's for the best.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.156
Those people
treated you like crap,

17:36.189 --> 17:38.091
they never
paid you on time,

17:38.125 --> 17:39.592
and I could always
hear the stress in your voice

17:39.626 --> 17:41.728
every time
you went over there.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.231
This landscaping thing
is only temporary.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.266
Your rock band is
about to take off.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.373
Oh, my God.
Burt, do you believe that?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.275
I know. I thought
we were the only ones

17:55.308 --> 17:56.576
who still had a VCR.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.745
Me, too! God, I'm so glad

17:58.778 --> 18:00.747
to hear that's what
you were thinking.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.282
I feel like we've been
so out of sync

18:02.315 --> 18:03.650
the last couple of weeks.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.119
It's like we lost something,
but I'm not sure what.

18:06.153 --> 18:08.321
Well, if I had to pick
three things out of thin air,

18:08.355 --> 18:10.323
I'd say compassion,

18:10.357 --> 18:13.126
understanding and
maybe listening.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.428
No, Burt, you know
what it is?

18:15.462 --> 18:16.729
It's listening,

18:16.763 --> 18:19.832
and I'm sorry
if I haven't been.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.368
Me, too.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.274
No, no, no.

18:27.307 --> 18:30.210
We are not filming
a sequel here, weirdoes .

18:30.243 --> 18:31.311
And we want our sex tape back.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.280
No. You can't.
We need it.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.447
I thought
we were friends.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.349
We barely know you.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.285
How 'bout we buy it
from you?

18:38.318 --> 18:39.319
No way.
Eight hundred.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.221
Deal. I'll get
my checkbook.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.522
Virginia, what
are you doing?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.191
I want to get
your van back

18:44.224 --> 18:46.426
and sacrifice for you
the way you sacrificed for me

18:46.459 --> 18:48.195
to get my Pigurines back.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.603
Could you stop staring at me?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.871
I know your mind's blown meeting
"Virginia from the sex tape,"

18:58.905 --> 19:01.641
but you're making me
feel self-conscious.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.210
Actually, um, I was just,

19:03.243 --> 19:05.312
I was wondering about
that-that mole that you have

19:05.345 --> 19:06.646
on your left butt cheek.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.147
Did you ever get that
checked out?

19:09.716 --> 19:11.184
We have to go.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.252
Okay.

19:14.687 --> 19:15.955
SABRINA:
That's it! That's it!

19:15.988 --> 19:17.290
I got it!

19:19.392 --> 19:20.827
Whoa. Hey, what's
going on?

19:20.860 --> 19:22.362
Mmm,

19:22.395 --> 19:23.463
I had to figure this out.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.198
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.500
I knew there had to be
an answer to this mystery,

19:27.534 --> 19:28.968
and I just wasn't
going to sleep

19:29.001 --> 19:30.370
until I figured it out.
Jimmy,

19:30.403 --> 19:33.373
you have been sleepwalking
your whole life.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.308
I'm not gonna let that
happen again.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.676
So I asked myself,

19:36.709 --> 19:38.311
what do all your
sleepwalks have in common?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.313
The red pins are where
you've been falling asleep,

19:40.347 --> 19:43.316
and the blue pins are
where you've been waking up.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.717
So if you extend this line,

19:44.751 --> 19:46.486
you'll see that
you've been walking

19:46.519 --> 19:49.656
towards the same place, okay?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.391
This is your Mecca.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.293
This is your homeland,

19:53.326 --> 19:54.361
the Chance residence.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.329
Yeah, but just now,
I woke up

19:56.363 --> 19:57.497
in the dining room.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.332
That's where your stuff is.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.834
Oh, yeah!

20:01.868 --> 20:03.870
That's right!

20:03.903 --> 20:06.673
Why doesn't anybody
ever believe me?!

20:06.706 --> 20:09.509
I believe you,
I believe you,

20:09.542 --> 20:11.711
but I will say,
you were a lot more fun

20:11.744 --> 20:13.846
when your favorite show was
Californication.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.948
*

20:15.982 --> 20:18.318
JIMMY:
People like to say,
"home is where the heart is,"

20:18.351 --> 20:21.254
but I kind of think
home is where your stuff is.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.555
You sure you don't mind me

20:22.589 --> 20:24.391
putting all my old junk
in this room?

20:24.424 --> 20:25.792
It's our room.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.260
Plus, I still have my old
college bulletin board

20:27.294 --> 20:28.595
and I got lots
of my old stuff.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.297
Just look in
the closet.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.034
Ahhhhhhh!

20:35.067 --> 20:37.304
Your parents were right.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.838
That's hilarious.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.541
* Reunited

20:41.574 --> 20:43.343
JIMMY:
Turns out I wasn't the only one

20:43.376 --> 20:46.413
who had an emotional
attachment to their stuff.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.547
* Reunited

20:47.580 --> 20:48.648
Oh.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.484
* 'cause we understood

20:51.518 --> 20:53.986
* There's
one perfect fit *

20:54.020 --> 20:57.657
* And, sugar,
this one is it *

20:57.690 --> 20:59.292
Don't worry.

20:59.326 --> 21:01.761
We never have to discuss
how he drove you.

21:01.794 --> 21:04.331
* Reunited...

21:04.364 --> 21:06.433
And some people
just can't get enough

21:06.466 --> 21:07.834
of other people's stuff.

21:10.337 --> 21:14.741
* Reunited and it
feels so good *

21:14.774 --> 21:16.743
Mostly, I was really glad

21:16.776 --> 21:18.478
to have all that
sleepwalking behind me...

21:18.511 --> 21:20.747
* 'cause we understood

21:20.780 --> 21:21.948
until I found out
it was hereditary.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.950
* There's
one perfect fit *

21:23.983 --> 21:27.654
* And, sugar,
this one is it *

21:27.687 --> 21:30.457
* We both are
so excited... *

21:31.391 --> 21:33.493
Boy:
Let's go Caps!
