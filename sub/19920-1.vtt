00:30.361 --> 00:32.509
Get... get back in the truck!

00:32.616 --> 00:33.783
Get back in the truck!

00:35.871 --> 00:37.204
Hey, dispatch?

00:37.239 --> 00:38.906
We have an emergency situation...

00:38.940 --> 00:40.441
You hear that?

00:44.746 --> 00:46.213
<i>Copy that. Stand by.</i>

00:48.450 --> 00:50.217
Somebody got shot.

00:50.252 --> 00:51.685
Officer Beck to headquarters. I...

00:51.720 --> 00:53.454
Headquarters, shots fired, shots fired.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.946
I need some units.
Shots fired, I need some units.

00:55.971 --> 00:57.191
Shots fired.

00:57.225 --> 01:01.061
<i>All units, all units
respond to Graham and Spring.</i>

01:02.564 --> 01:04.164
Damn!

01:06.768 --> 01:08.302
Back, back!

01:12.173 --> 01:14.041
- Got him covered?
- I got him covered.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.447
Move it, move back.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.584
Stay back.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.321
Get out of the way.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.490
Move it.

01:29.524 --> 01:30.391
Stay behind the line.

01:36.131 --> 01:37.564
Stay behind the tape.

01:37.599 --> 01:38.699
Back up.

01:39.634 --> 01:41.101
Back up.

01:41.136 --> 01:43.737
Hey, get back. I said back up.

01:43.772 --> 01:45.172
Payback's a bitch.

02:23.044 --> 02:24.916
<i>Bottom of the ninth inning, two outs.</i>

02:24.988 --> 02:26.947
<i>Tying run on second base.</i>

02:27.009 --> 02:28.682
<i>Yale's down 1-nothing.</i>

02:28.717 --> 02:30.609
<i>Terry has a walk and a double,</i>

02:30.695 --> 02:32.886
<i>but is now looking at an 0-2 count.</i>

02:32.921 --> 02:34.913
<i>He steps to the plate.</i>

02:35.187 --> 02:37.091
<i>Wow, what is Terry doing?</i>

02:37.125 --> 02:39.026
<i>That is some serious trash-talking.</i>

02:39.060 --> 02:41.362
<i>Crowd doesn't like it.
Not sure I do, either.</i>

02:41.396 --> 02:42.429
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

02:42.464 --> 02:46.694
<i>Folks, that is high, that is deep,
that is out of here!</i>

02:46.719 --> 02:48.402
<i>Home run!</i>

02:50.705 --> 02:52.873
- What do you see, Ruiz?
- An arrogant ass.

02:52.907 --> 02:54.508
Is that accurate?

02:54.542 --> 02:56.010
Not entirely, sir.

02:56.044 --> 02:58.679
So why go Babe Ruth?

02:58.713 --> 03:00.881
Well, because once
you tell someone how bad

03:00.915 --> 03:03.584
you're about to screw them,
you have to come through.

03:06.323 --> 03:08.604
There's been a police shooting
of an unarmed man today.

03:08.723 --> 03:10.557
Gate Station, North Carolina.

03:10.592 --> 03:13.360
Governor called me personally.

03:13.395 --> 03:15.798
She wants the DOJ
to handle the investigation.

03:15.823 --> 03:17.798
She doesn't want another Ferguson.

03:17.832 --> 03:20.567
It's a black cop and a white kid.

03:21.011 --> 03:22.645
Ruiz is going to run it,

03:22.670 --> 03:26.693
but she wants a black prosecutor
out front; optics.

03:27.342 --> 03:30.132
This climate, only a black man
can indict this black cop

03:30.157 --> 03:33.009
without inciting tensions.
If he's guilty.

03:33.782 --> 03:36.383
I've been through a stack of résumés,

03:36.418 --> 03:37.851
and you guys all look the same.

03:37.886 --> 03:39.920
First in your class at an Ivy.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.889
Law review. All closers.

03:41.923 --> 03:46.026
What I need is a cleaner.

03:47.195 --> 03:48.695
I need that guy

03:48.730 --> 03:51.231
who points to the fence
with two strikes on him.

03:51.266 --> 03:52.733
He's barely a year out of law school.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.835
That's just math, sir.

03:54.869 --> 03:56.437
My recent work on
the Wynn case proved it.

03:56.471 --> 03:58.238
I took over arguments
and got three indictments.

03:58.273 --> 04:01.341
The team got three indictments.

04:01.376 --> 04:03.377
Yes, the team.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.478
What about those optics?

04:04.512 --> 04:05.946
All I care about is the truth.

04:05.980 --> 04:08.315
And my truth has no color.

04:08.349 --> 04:09.817
That's a lovely naiveté.

04:09.851 --> 04:10.717
Thank you.

04:10.752 --> 04:11.819
That wasn't praise.

04:16.305 --> 04:19.406
Our own Attorney General
said that the biggest challenge

04:19.430 --> 04:22.680
for all of us in this office
is not only to represent

04:22.705 --> 04:25.866
and enforce the law,
but to use it to make real

04:25.900 --> 04:29.500
the promise of America,
the promise of fairness

04:29.525 --> 04:31.305
and equality.

04:31.775 --> 04:33.440
Is she naive, sir?

04:35.877 --> 04:39.179
Because if so, I'm happy
to wear that badge with her.

04:50.091 --> 04:51.692
Uh-oh, what you got?

04:51.726 --> 04:54.194
Eh, eh, eh. Seven, eight...

04:54.229 --> 04:56.063
bam!

04:56.097 --> 04:59.066
Oh, lucky!

04:59.100 --> 05:00.534
Hey, what's that on your face?

05:00.568 --> 05:03.337
What's that on your face?

05:13.047 --> 05:14.381
Listen, Boogs,

05:14.415 --> 05:15.983
Mommy has to go out of town for work.

05:16.017 --> 05:17.484
For how long this time?

05:17.519 --> 05:20.954
I don't know, but, uh,
we're going to Face Chat

05:20.989 --> 05:22.489
every morning and every night, okay?

05:22.524 --> 05:26.193
Even though that face will
probably break my computer.

05:26.227 --> 05:28.729
Well, I get my looks from you.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.531
- Oh!
- Hey, Kai.

05:30.565 --> 05:32.921
- It's time for bed.
- What?

05:32.946 --> 05:34.514
No.

05:34.539 --> 05:37.504
Hey, Paula, we're good.
We're just gonna play one more game.

05:37.589 --> 05:39.623
Her bedtime is 8:30.

05:39.648 --> 05:43.310
We can make an exception tonight.

05:43.344 --> 05:45.473
Look, you're not the one
who has to drag her

05:45.498 --> 05:47.848
out of bed in the morning
and get her to school on time.

05:47.873 --> 05:49.049
I'm not even sleepy, yet.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.451
Kai, start your night routine, now!

05:53.788 --> 05:57.758
It's okay, Boogs... Mommy loves you.

05:57.792 --> 05:58.892
Mmm, I love you, I love you.

06:00.028 --> 06:02.663
Good night.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.537
Raise your voice
in front of my kid again

06:10.574 --> 06:12.369
and I'll give you
a hysterectomy with my fist.

06:12.394 --> 06:15.309
Hey, hey, hey, what's happening?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.278
Get off me!

06:18.313 --> 06:20.480
What the hell, Ashe?

06:20.515 --> 06:23.283
She's a child, Javi,
trying to play house.

06:23.318 --> 06:26.153
Kai has a mother... remind her of that.

06:26.187 --> 06:27.321
By throwing a vase at her head?

06:27.355 --> 06:28.655
I threw it by her head.

06:33.261 --> 06:34.661
- You need to see somebody.
- I am.

06:34.696 --> 06:36.330
- I'm serious.
- I will.

06:36.364 --> 06:37.998
I can't have this craziness.

06:38.032 --> 06:39.499
You used to like crazy.

06:39.534 --> 06:41.835
Yeah, but then we had a kid.

06:41.869 --> 06:46.373
So you go get yourself wifey material.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.840
With the apron and dinner waiting
for you when you get home.

06:49.568 --> 06:52.256
We both know you're bored as hell.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.451
Does she know what you're really like?

06:56.117 --> 06:57.584
How you like it?

07:00.047 --> 07:02.923
Does she know when you're with
her, I'm inside your head?

07:08.696 --> 07:11.064
I got to go check on my daughter.

07:13.034 --> 07:16.406
Tell her... tell her
I'm gonna call her tomorrow.

07:27.282 --> 07:28.709
<i>Second in touchdowns.</i>

07:28.734 --> 07:30.147
<i>Mace, what-what's up with that?</i>

07:30.172 --> 07:32.052
<i>Are you starting to get
a little tired inside the 20?</i>

07:35.023 --> 07:37.991
- So you're their boy.
- Excuse me?

07:38.026 --> 07:41.395
I'm Ashe Akino... your investigator.

07:41.429 --> 07:43.163
Preston Terry, your boss.

07:43.197 --> 07:44.698
Interim, right?

07:44.732 --> 07:47.668
Ruiz is just tying up some
loose ends on another case?

07:47.702 --> 07:50.003
Yeah, he'll be done in about a week.

07:50.038 --> 07:52.739
I know Ruiz, but what's your steelo?

07:52.774 --> 07:54.340
How aggressive I go is up to you.

07:54.365 --> 07:56.810
Do your job the right way...
by the book.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.013
Job the right way... you got it.

08:00.178 --> 08:01.670
Boss.

08:04.052 --> 08:05.919
<i>Welcome to North Carolina.</i>

08:05.953 --> 08:08.021
<i>For those of you boarding
flights to Chicago...</i>

08:13.394 --> 08:14.461
Preston Terry?

08:14.495 --> 08:15.962
- Yes?
- Hi.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.664
I'm Sarah Ellis,
aide to Governor Eamons.

08:17.699 --> 08:19.304
Welcome to North Carolina.

08:19.329 --> 08:20.890
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

08:20.915 --> 08:22.636
- Ashe Akino.
- My investigator.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.539
Well, I'm sure you're eager
to hit the ground running.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.007
The governor's just hoping
to have a quick word with you.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.498
Of course.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.278
<i>I wish you were here</i>

08:31.312 --> 08:33.613
under better circumstances,
but I do hope

08:33.648 --> 08:36.450
you'll get a feel for
our Southern hospitality.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.129
Born and raised in Virginia, ma'am.

08:38.154 --> 08:39.852
A Southern gentleman.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.489
Though you all call yourselves
Mid-Atlantic state now.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.124
No, that's just the Northern Virginians.

08:44.158 --> 08:46.360
Well, I want you to know I am

08:46.394 --> 08:49.363
fully behind this investigation,
and I have assurances

08:49.397 --> 08:51.345
from the department you'll
have their full cooperation.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.566
Well, we appreciate that, ma'am.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.541
I'm not a fan of surprises,

08:54.575 --> 08:56.746
so I'd appreciate
being kept up to speed.

08:56.771 --> 08:59.639
That said, she's a busy woman,
so just reach out to me.

08:59.674 --> 09:01.107
I'll be at your hotel

09:01.142 --> 09:02.742
for the next few days to make
sure you guys get a good start.

09:02.777 --> 09:04.344
I want to make sure
to stay in front of this.

09:04.378 --> 09:08.081
We don't need any crazy rednecks
looting the local Cracker Barrel.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.416
Yes, ma'am.

09:34.124 --> 09:35.775
Move it.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.155
I said be quiet.

09:53.995 --> 09:55.228
Can I help you?

09:55.263 --> 09:57.564
Preston Terry, attorney
with DOJ Civil Rights.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.399
I should have known from the suit.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.935
We're strictly buy one,
get two free down here.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.238
- This is Ashe Akino, my investigator.
- Hi.

10:05.273 --> 10:06.740
How long you been on the job?

10:06.774 --> 10:09.843
Two years patrol, got tapped by DEA,

10:09.877 --> 10:12.345
worked Colombia and Mexico
for six years.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.481
And you gave all that up
for the cushy life?

10:14.515 --> 10:17.083
I like being my own boss.

10:17.118 --> 10:18.818
So where y'all want to start?
Whatever you need.

10:18.853 --> 10:20.453
A conversation with Deputy Beck,

10:20.488 --> 10:22.088
and then the crime scene.

10:22.123 --> 10:24.524
Not a crime scene until
the crime has been determined.

10:26.127 --> 10:28.361
- Absolutely right.
- Right.

10:28.396 --> 10:30.697
Beck's in Interview Two.

10:33.301 --> 10:36.403
All right, guys, roll call.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.943
I'm not talking without my union rep.

10:40.224 --> 10:41.730
Look, I've read your report.

10:41.755 --> 10:43.877
I just want to hear it from you.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.313
It's just a conversation.

10:48.282 --> 10:49.950
I've been where you're at.

11:00.094 --> 11:03.330
My second day on the streets,
I'm out with my T.O.

11:03.364 --> 11:05.031
White dude.

11:05.066 --> 11:06.900
Routine traffic stop.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.970
Only the kid in the passenger
seat takes off running.

11:10.004 --> 11:12.506
So I give chase.

11:12.540 --> 11:16.843
Catch him pretty quick,
but he starts fighting me.

11:16.878 --> 11:18.578
My T.O. just stands there watching,

11:18.613 --> 11:21.915
wants to see if a girl
can handle herself.

11:21.949 --> 11:25.585
I get the upper hand,
when suddenly the kid

11:25.620 --> 11:28.321
is reaching for something behind him.

11:28.356 --> 11:29.856
My T.O. is frozen.

11:29.891 --> 11:31.992
He yells, "Gun!"

11:32.026 --> 11:35.662
I draw and I shoot
this kid in the chest.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.699
Only there's no gun, just a cell phone.

11:39.734 --> 11:42.269
18 years old.

11:42.303 --> 11:44.871
But I told the truth.

11:44.906 --> 11:46.907
At least I have that.

11:46.941 --> 11:48.508
And you were cleared?

11:48.543 --> 11:53.095
Ruled justifiable.
I reasonably feared for my life.

11:59.921 --> 12:01.054
It was a clean shoot.

12:02.223 --> 12:04.111
Tell me about it.

12:06.117 --> 12:07.551
I'm on patrol.

12:07.695 --> 12:09.529
White guy in a nice vehicle.

12:09.736 --> 12:11.273
White guy in that neighborhood

12:11.298 --> 12:13.867
usually means drugs, so I hit my lights,

12:13.901 --> 12:15.802
pull him over.

12:15.836 --> 12:19.339
I approach the vehicle,
ask him a few questions, but...

12:19.373 --> 12:21.975
the guy was belligerent.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.810
Refuses to answer anything.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.146
So I ask him to step out of the vehicle.

12:26.180 --> 12:29.382
He refuses.

12:29.417 --> 12:33.420
So I put my hand on my weapon
and I ask him again.

12:33.454 --> 12:37.824
He finally complies,
but as he steps out,

12:37.858 --> 12:41.595
he reaches for my gun,
actually gets a hand on it.

12:44.662 --> 12:47.331
In that moment, it was either him or me.

12:48.703 --> 12:50.003
And I shot him.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.847
Four times.

12:53.347 --> 12:55.742
Yes, he continued to struggle.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.411
Was there anything substantiating
your initial suspicions?

12:58.446 --> 13:01.314
Lieutenant Breeland found
marijuana, two 20s,

13:01.349 --> 13:02.849
in his search of the vehicle.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.051
And was this search done
before or after the shooting?

13:05.086 --> 13:07.087
After.

13:11.158 --> 13:14.127
Now, you said white guy in
that neighborhood means drugs.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.196
- Yes, sir.
- Was there a legitimate cause

13:16.230 --> 13:18.665
for the initial stop, or was
it all just based on profiling?

13:23.237 --> 13:26.072
I'm gonna wait for my union rep now.

13:31.679 --> 13:35.148
He's ready to give me his life
story, and you shut him down.

13:35.182 --> 13:37.016
I don't do anything without a reason.

13:37.051 --> 13:38.585
Really?

13:38.619 --> 13:41.187
'Cause it felt like a rookie mistake.

13:41.222 --> 13:42.489
From now on,

13:42.523 --> 13:44.706
I'll handle the interviews.

13:44.759 --> 13:47.894
Look, I understand you
like being your own boss,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.330
but that's not the case here.

13:50.364 --> 13:52.807
Like you said, you follow my lead.

13:54.635 --> 13:58.071
Wow, only took you two hours
to start swinging your junk.

13:58.105 --> 13:59.939
Most guys at least wait a day.

13:59.974 --> 14:02.609
I don't believe in wasting time.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.377
Neither do I.

14:04.412 --> 14:06.279
You're a smart brother...
you've seen my file.

14:06.313 --> 14:08.481
So ask yourself, if I tell

14:08.516 --> 14:10.279
Ruiz you don't know
what the hell you're doing,

14:10.365 --> 14:12.865
who goes, who stays?

14:57.760 --> 14:58.994
No surveillance cameras,

14:59.028 --> 15:00.729
but someone saw something.

15:00.763 --> 15:02.464
What's good, sis?

15:02.499 --> 15:03.799
I'm Ashe,

15:03.833 --> 15:05.901
from the Department of Justice.

15:05.935 --> 15:07.136
We're here investigating a shooting.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.570
- You see anything?
- Nope.

15:08.605 --> 15:10.572
- Know anybody who did?
- Yeah.

15:10.607 --> 15:11.773
The cop that shot him.

15:11.808 --> 15:14.143
- You looking for video?
- You got any?

15:14.177 --> 15:17.079
Yeah, I got the new <i>Star Wars...</i>
not even out yet.

15:18.604 --> 15:20.983
Look, we're not police...
we're investigating police.

15:21.017 --> 15:22.451
You smell like police.

15:22.485 --> 15:23.785
That your squad?

15:23.820 --> 15:25.420
That against the law?

15:25.455 --> 15:27.089
That's my big brother.

15:27.123 --> 15:28.290
Whatever, man.

15:28.324 --> 15:30.826
I'm serious... real talk, man, look.

15:33.196 --> 15:35.330
Mace a beast!

15:35.365 --> 15:36.698
- He's your fam for real?
- Mm-hmm.

15:36.733 --> 15:38.634
How come you're not in the league?

15:38.668 --> 15:40.369
Decided to change the world instead.

15:40.403 --> 15:42.671
Damn, you messed up.

15:42.705 --> 15:45.474
So what's this dude Beck like?

15:45.508 --> 15:46.875
He's all right.

15:46.910 --> 15:49.311
Not like the boys who roll through
here cracking heads for nothing.

15:49.345 --> 15:50.468
He's a sellout.

15:50.493 --> 15:52.814
You don't think the neighborhood
could use black cops?

15:52.849 --> 15:54.149
Yeah, but he ain't hood no more.

15:54.184 --> 15:55.784
So y'all ain't seen nothing, or...

15:55.818 --> 15:57.619
hear nothing?

15:57.999 --> 15:59.623
No one's got answers for you,

15:59.648 --> 16:01.156
'cause you keep asking
the wrong question.

16:01.191 --> 16:02.958
So what's the right question?

16:06.963 --> 16:08.030
Aw, man.

16:08.932 --> 16:11.266
Look, talk to us... we can protect you.

16:16.272 --> 16:19.808
They trying to intimidate them or us?

16:24.647 --> 16:26.448
The police have been here two times now,

16:26.482 --> 16:28.817
asking these same questions.

16:28.851 --> 16:31.253
Meanwhile, this man is still
walking around free.

16:31.287 --> 16:33.322
I understand how you feel.

16:33.356 --> 16:34.756
No, you don't.

16:34.791 --> 16:36.525
My son is dead.

16:39.513 --> 16:42.282
People seem put off by my anger.

16:43.230 --> 16:45.000
They're expecting something else.

16:45.034 --> 16:47.306
Do you know why your son
was in that neighborhood?

16:47.331 --> 16:49.004
Driving in that neighborhood
is not a crime.

16:49.038 --> 16:50.005
What about drugs?

16:50.039 --> 16:52.107
My son didn't do drugs.

16:52.141 --> 16:54.376
Did they tell you they found
marijuana in his car?

16:54.410 --> 16:56.478
I don't care.

16:56.512 --> 16:57.946
The officer said he went for his gun.

16:57.981 --> 16:59.381
Jesse would never do that!

16:59.415 --> 17:00.249
How do you know?

17:00.283 --> 17:02.117
Because I know my son.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.653
Y'all can try to paint him
as a criminal all you want,

17:04.686 --> 17:06.588
but that is not who he was.

17:06.623 --> 17:08.790
He was a great kid.

17:11.661 --> 17:13.829
And he would hate this shirt.

17:13.863 --> 17:17.332
But the funeral home said
he had to be in a suit,

17:17.367 --> 17:21.236
and all he has are T-shirts
with comics on them.

17:21.271 --> 17:25.107
So I spent the entire morning
shopping for this dress shirt

17:25.141 --> 17:28.109
I know he'd never wear.

17:29.646 --> 17:31.940
We're very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

17:33.716 --> 17:36.136
I didn't lose him.

17:36.443 --> 17:38.587
He was murdered.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.522
<i>I'm a good cop.</i>

17:41.412 --> 17:44.826
Yes, but perception is reality.

17:45.131 --> 17:47.607
You got to change perception.

17:47.888 --> 17:52.904
Come to my church.
Make a statement in God's house.

17:52.929 --> 17:54.002
I'll stand with you.

17:54.037 --> 17:55.103
I'm not making any statements.

17:55.138 --> 17:56.605
- Josh, maybe it would be...
- No.

17:56.639 --> 17:58.707
Brother, the media's a powerful thing.

17:58.741 --> 18:01.209
They can make the guilty
innocent, innocent guilty.

18:01.244 --> 18:03.111
And an unknown pastor a star.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.251
All right, then.

18:11.621 --> 18:14.122
Thank you for your hospitality.

18:21.164 --> 18:23.432
<i>A tragedy has come</i>

18:23.466 --> 18:26.168
to Gate Station, the town I grew up in.

18:26.202 --> 18:28.603
A young college student

18:28.638 --> 18:30.572
has been killed.

18:30.606 --> 18:32.741
And when there are questions,
I want answers.

18:32.775 --> 18:36.311
I have personally reached out
to the Department of Justice

18:36.346 --> 18:37.946
and asked for an outside prosecutor

18:37.980 --> 18:39.681
to ensure an impartial investigation

18:39.716 --> 18:40.782
into this matter.

18:40.817 --> 18:42.784
And Sheriff Platt agrees.

18:42.819 --> 18:45.253
He, too, wants to make sure
that trust remains

18:45.288 --> 18:47.656
between law enforcement
and the community.

18:47.690 --> 18:49.057
What trust?

18:50.660 --> 18:52.361
Yes, ma'am.

18:52.395 --> 18:53.795
I would like to introduce Preston Terry,

18:53.830 --> 18:55.097
who will answer any questions.

18:55.131 --> 18:57.599
- Mr. Terry, thank you.
- Thank you, Governor.

18:57.633 --> 19:00.802
Is there any video of the shooting,
or any witnesses?

19:00.837 --> 19:04.406
Uh, no video has surfaced as of yet,
and no witnesses have come forward.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.640
But it's still early
in the investigation.

19:05.675 --> 19:08.477
Can you confirm that the name
of the officer is Joshua Beck?

19:08.511 --> 19:10.045
We're not releasing
his name at this time.

19:10.079 --> 19:11.213
But he is black?

19:11.247 --> 19:14.119
- I'm not at liberty to say.
- We've all seen the cell phone footage.

19:14.144 --> 19:15.951
The officer is black,
the victim is white.

19:15.985 --> 19:18.720
What I don't understand
is why you're here.

19:18.755 --> 19:20.655
All the murdering of unarmed black men

19:20.690 --> 19:23.058
by police across this country, and this

19:23.092 --> 19:25.394
is the one that the government
is investigating?

19:25.428 --> 19:27.262
Oh, so only black lives matter?

19:27.296 --> 19:29.097
I'm sorry, when is the last time
you were pulled over

19:29.132 --> 19:31.133
by the police and didn't know if you
were going to make it out alive?

19:31.167 --> 19:33.284
Listen, as a prosecutor,

19:33.309 --> 19:35.823
it is my job to ignore
all personal biases

19:35.848 --> 19:37.406
and to focus on the truth.

19:37.848 --> 19:39.775
And I must admit, that can be hard.

19:39.809 --> 19:41.591
That can be tough.

19:41.772 --> 19:45.341
See, when I watch recent video of...
of Laquan McDonald,

19:45.505 --> 19:48.350
of Tamir Rice, of Walter Scott,
shot in the back,

19:48.708 --> 19:51.108
murdered while running away
from a child support payment,

19:51.133 --> 19:52.444
I am sickened.

19:52.537 --> 19:54.790
Sickened by the utter lack of humanity

19:54.824 --> 19:57.192
displayed by those officers and angered

19:57.226 --> 19:59.294
at the arrogance of their lies.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.929
See, now, they knew that
there would be an assumption

20:00.963 --> 20:04.499
of innocence not because of
blue, but because of white.

20:04.534 --> 20:07.302
And now an anomaly has occurred.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.472
A black police officer has shot
and killed an unarmed white man,

20:10.506 --> 20:12.507
and they have sent in the cavalry.

20:12.542 --> 20:13.975
Now, is the cavalry here

20:14.010 --> 20:15.877
to bring justice to the unarmed
white man,

20:15.912 --> 20:17.879
or to exonerate an innocent
black police officer?

20:17.914 --> 20:19.514
I won't know until I've garnered all

20:19.541 --> 20:22.818
: <i>...the facts of the case.
But I am here because every citizen</i>

20:22.843 --> 20:25.654
<i>deserves a system
that is fair and transparent.</i>

20:25.688 --> 20:28.023
<i>I am here because
we are creating a generation</i>

20:28.057 --> 20:29.858
<i>of Americans who are becoming quickly</i>

20:29.892 --> 20:33.232
<i>disillusioned with the postracial
America we like to tout.</i>

20:33.264 --> 20:35.405
<i>In fact, I'm not even a day
into this case, and already</i>

20:35.430 --> 20:37.065
<i>we see it's about race.</i>

20:37.099 --> 20:39.301
But I am not disillusioned.

20:39.335 --> 20:41.636
I am working this case as a prosecutor

20:41.671 --> 20:42.904
trying to determine

20:42.939 --> 20:45.240
what happened that day between two men.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.275
And I believe that my success

20:47.310 --> 20:49.311
will serve as an example
to us all of why we have

20:49.445 --> 20:53.014
got to start putting
each other's humanity first.

20:53.049 --> 20:55.317
None of us will like the America
we end up with

20:55.351 --> 20:57.719
if we don't start working
very hard at this.

20:57.753 --> 21:00.589
And that work begins today.

21:00.623 --> 21:01.790
Thank you.

21:01.824 --> 21:03.959
Thank you very much.

21:03.993 --> 21:06.461
Governor!

21:06.496 --> 21:08.463
You just made the rest of my day hell.

21:08.498 --> 21:09.631
How's that?

21:09.665 --> 21:11.166
She worked all morning on that speech,

21:11.200 --> 21:14.135
and now no one will remember
a single word of it.

21:14.170 --> 21:16.171
You owe me for that.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.943
Pastor Janae James.

21:21.978 --> 21:24.012
Those were some powerful words.

21:24.146 --> 21:26.147
I really hope you're here
to listen, too.

21:26.182 --> 21:27.616
Absolutely.

21:27.650 --> 21:30.018
That's a whole lot harder to do.

21:30.052 --> 21:31.720
Why do I feel a sermon coming on?

21:33.434 --> 21:35.591
I'll save that for Sunday.

21:36.359 --> 21:38.593
Chosen House, 10:00 a.m.

21:49.450 --> 21:52.493
<i>Today, during a speech on the steps
of Gate Station City Hall...</i>

21:52.518 --> 21:54.654
I'll have what he's having.

21:54.744 --> 21:56.204
It's just orange juice.

21:56.229 --> 21:59.147
So y-you just assume I'm a drinker?

21:59.181 --> 22:00.916
Educated guess.

22:00.950 --> 22:02.450
I'm sort of offended.

22:03.719 --> 22:05.771
You can throw some vodka in there.

22:08.624 --> 22:10.325
Your speech surprised me today.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.527
You don't know me well
enough to be surprised.

22:12.562 --> 22:16.131
You're right... you and I,
we need to find our rhythm.

22:16.165 --> 22:17.966
Right now we're just butting heads.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.768
Yeah, well, you're the one banging.

22:19.802 --> 22:21.703
You judge too quickly.

22:21.737 --> 22:23.204
I was police... it's what we do.

22:23.239 --> 22:25.040
You judged me too quickly.

22:25.074 --> 22:26.675
I'm not a sellout.

22:26.709 --> 22:28.009
Did I call you one?

22:28.044 --> 22:29.477
You called me "their boy."

22:29.512 --> 22:32.781
Fine, fine, I apologize.

22:32.815 --> 22:34.883
I also thought you were gay.

22:34.917 --> 22:36.952
Sorry for that, too, I guess.

22:36.986 --> 22:38.453
Now, why would you think that?

22:38.487 --> 22:40.741
Because I got nothing
from you when we first met.

22:40.766 --> 22:42.557
Yeah, well, maybe you're not my type.

22:42.592 --> 22:44.123
I'm every guy's type.

22:46.664 --> 22:49.297
Now, anyway, I don't piss where I eat.

22:49.332 --> 22:51.399
Hmm.

22:51.434 --> 22:52.801
So what's your type?

22:52.835 --> 22:54.636
I guess I'm waiting on my Michelle.

22:54.670 --> 22:55.670
- Obama?
- Mm-hmm.

22:55.705 --> 22:57.706
She's dope... why her?

22:57.740 --> 22:59.107
She's the kind of woman

22:59.141 --> 23:02.477
that makes you seem like a better man.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.679
Couldn't handle me anyway.

23:06.515 --> 23:10.012
That story you told Beck, was that true?

23:10.820 --> 23:11.987
Yep.

23:13.623 --> 23:15.523
How does anyone get over that?

23:17.026 --> 23:20.195
I know it's gonna
come back on me one day.

23:20.229 --> 23:23.498
I just, um, don't want it
coming back on my daughter.

23:23.532 --> 23:25.634
- How old is she?
- Six.

23:29.805 --> 23:31.106
Look, I'll take care of this.

23:31.140 --> 23:32.374
You grab coffee tomorrow.

23:32.408 --> 23:33.475
You got it.

23:33.509 --> 23:35.710
Boss.

23:35.745 --> 23:38.747
You believe half of what
you said in that speech?

23:40.516 --> 23:42.183
Half.

24:00.269 --> 24:01.636
Hey.

24:01.671 --> 24:02.504
You lost?

24:04.006 --> 24:05.173
I'm looking for you.

24:05.207 --> 24:07.509
I don't talk to Five-O.

24:07.543 --> 24:09.010
I already told you, I'm not a cop.

24:09.045 --> 24:11.746
Look, bro, I've got nothing to say.

24:11.781 --> 24:14.082
I'm going to see
my brother this weekend.

24:14.116 --> 24:15.417
You want a signed football?

24:15.451 --> 24:17.752
For real?

24:17.787 --> 24:19.187
You straight bribing me, man.

24:19.221 --> 24:20.955
You said I wasn't
asking the right question.

24:20.990 --> 24:22.424
So what do I got to ask?

24:22.458 --> 24:25.827
You need to go ask Miss Campbell.

24:25.861 --> 24:27.295
Who's Miss Campbell?

24:27.329 --> 24:29.297
This lady in The Houses.

24:29.331 --> 24:30.899
What are The Houses?

24:51.053 --> 24:52.687
308.

25:22.887 --> 25:24.098
Morning.

25:24.186 --> 25:25.512
Morning.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.051
- Thanks.
- What the hell?

25:28.139 --> 25:29.539
What happened?

25:29.566 --> 25:31.712
Last night, part of town
called The Houses.

25:31.829 --> 25:32.968
I was following a lead.

25:32.993 --> 25:34.712
Do you think I'm incapable
of doing my job?

25:34.746 --> 25:35.687
No.

25:35.712 --> 25:37.847
Then stop trying to do it for me.

25:38.016 --> 25:41.027
I can't keep chalking this
up to you being brand-new.

25:41.105 --> 25:42.752
Look, I felt like I made a connection

25:42.777 --> 25:44.577
with that kid in the jersey.

25:44.612 --> 25:46.386
Okay, I thought maybe
if we spoke one on one

25:46.411 --> 25:48.679
I could get some more info.

25:48.849 --> 25:51.087
But you're right... I should have
spoken to you first.

25:51.112 --> 25:52.379
Yeah, you should have.

25:52.486 --> 25:54.220
You should see a doctor.

25:55.284 --> 25:57.740
Pride hurts more than
my body, but thank you.

25:57.967 --> 25:59.801
So what'd he tell you?

26:00.492 --> 26:02.223
He told me to speak
to a woman in The Houses

26:02.248 --> 26:04.306
named Miss Campbell in 308.

26:04.340 --> 26:06.557
Which somebody didn't want you to do.

26:06.582 --> 26:08.650
That is the conclusion I'm drawing, yes.

26:08.686 --> 26:10.520
So let me go find out what she knows.

26:10.546 --> 26:11.813
You can't go by yourself.

26:11.847 --> 26:13.515
I got a gun.

26:39.108 --> 26:40.375
How y'all doing?

26:45.228 --> 26:46.662
Who is it?

26:46.687 --> 26:48.416
We're from the Department of Justice.

26:48.451 --> 26:49.951
We're here to see Miss Campbell.

26:50.450 --> 26:51.818
Department of Justice...

26:51.843 --> 26:53.121
that's with the government, right?

26:53.155 --> 26:56.324
Yes, ma'am, we're here
investigating a shooting.

27:09.205 --> 27:11.573
- You're the one was on TV.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:11.607 --> 27:13.575
Sounded almost like a preacher.

27:13.609 --> 27:14.929
What do you know

27:14.954 --> 27:17.589
about the young white kid who
was just killed by the cop?

27:17.765 --> 27:19.914
The white kid... why would I know
anything about that?

27:19.949 --> 27:21.750
We were told to ask you the question.

27:21.784 --> 27:24.475
By who? I don't know why they said that.

27:24.500 --> 27:25.987
Do you know Officer Beck?

27:26.021 --> 27:29.321
I mean, I seened him around,
but I don't know him.

27:29.524 --> 27:31.426
What about the young man
who was killed, Jesse Carr?

27:31.460 --> 27:33.628
I'm sorry, I don't know anything.

27:45.775 --> 27:47.041
When did you lose your son?

27:53.416 --> 27:55.417
Thought that's why you was here.

27:55.451 --> 27:56.718
Should've known better.

27:56.752 --> 27:57.685
What do you mean?

27:57.720 --> 28:00.388
I can't talk about it.

28:00.423 --> 28:01.856
Who told you that, your lawyer?

28:02.892 --> 28:05.126
The police?

28:05.161 --> 28:07.295
Look, we're not police.

28:07.329 --> 28:09.030
Whatever you say stays right here.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.332
Your son's death was never investigated?

28:11.367 --> 28:15.036
Meanwhile this white boy all over my TV.

28:15.070 --> 28:17.105
What did the police tell you?

28:19.341 --> 28:22.977
They knock on my door,
say they found Joey dead.

28:23.012 --> 28:26.147
No "Sorry for your loss, ma'am."

28:26.182 --> 28:28.817
No "You okay, ma'am?"

28:28.851 --> 28:31.052
They just come in
and go through his things,

28:31.086 --> 28:33.087
and found a bag of weed.

28:33.122 --> 28:36.858
Then another cop come in, say I
could go to jail for that, too.

28:36.892 --> 28:39.928
Say I need to stay quiet while
they do their investigation,

28:39.962 --> 28:41.863
otherwise it'd be obstruction,
and the judge

28:41.897 --> 28:43.598
could take away my kid.

28:43.997 --> 28:45.867
Have you heard any more about it?

28:45.901 --> 28:48.369
Nothing from police.

28:48.739 --> 28:51.306
But people round here are saying
they had something to do with it.

28:52.942 --> 28:54.275
There were witnesses?

28:54.310 --> 28:57.479
Just not the right kind.

28:58.346 --> 29:00.548
Guess we figured out the right question.

29:00.583 --> 29:02.383
Nothing she says has anything
to do with our case.

29:02.418 --> 29:03.718
It has everything to do with it.

29:03.752 --> 29:05.820
The department is obviously corrupt.

29:05.855 --> 29:07.489
Just because someone told her the police

29:07.523 --> 29:09.190
were involved doesn't make it fact.

29:09.225 --> 29:13.461
But a cop telling her to keep her
mouth shut, or they'll take her kid?

29:13.496 --> 29:14.729
We have to dig.

29:14.763 --> 29:16.197
Look, I understand your instinct,

29:16.232 --> 29:17.799
but that's not why we're here.

29:17.833 --> 29:19.501
I don't think you do.

29:19.535 --> 29:20.535
What?

29:20.569 --> 29:21.836
Share my instincts.

29:21.871 --> 29:23.338
'Cause I'm real uncomfortable right now.

29:23.372 --> 29:25.485
Look, Beck is the only
brother in the department

29:25.510 --> 29:28.309
in a city that's 65% black.
I'm uncomfortable.

29:28.344 --> 29:30.078
But we have to work the case
we've been assigned.

29:30.112 --> 29:32.714
We do a great job, then we have
the leverage to open it up.

29:32.748 --> 29:34.315
You can do that?

29:34.350 --> 29:35.917
Just forget what you just heard?

29:35.951 --> 29:38.753
I'm not asking you to forget...
I'm asking you to be patient.

29:38.787 --> 29:40.054
Can you do that?

29:41.457 --> 29:42.524
Sure.

29:47.897 --> 29:49.764
Jumps off the balcony.

29:49.798 --> 29:52.200
I swear to God this guy
starts pissing himself.

29:54.803 --> 29:56.704
Y'all headed to choir practice?

29:56.739 --> 30:00.108
What do you know about choir practice?

30:00.142 --> 30:02.010
I know I'm buying.

30:02.044 --> 30:03.545
Another one?

30:05.881 --> 30:06.881
Where are all the females?

30:06.916 --> 30:08.283
Are you looking for one?

30:08.317 --> 30:09.417
Come on, now.

30:09.451 --> 30:11.419
Cheers.

30:13.255 --> 30:15.223
Ooh.

30:15.257 --> 30:17.692
What the hell was that?

30:17.726 --> 30:19.093
Prairie Fire.

30:19.128 --> 30:20.528
It's Wild Turkey and Tabasco.

30:20.563 --> 30:23.031
I think I just grew a testicle.

30:23.065 --> 30:25.600
- Y'all get home safe, now.
- Breeland, right?

30:25.634 --> 30:27.802
Lieutenant Breeland.

30:27.836 --> 30:29.871
We were supposed to have a conversation.

30:29.905 --> 30:31.306
Yeah, I don't go in the box.

30:31.340 --> 30:33.074
Wasn't trying to put you there.

30:33.108 --> 30:35.808
You were first on the scene...
just looking for a quick statement.

30:42.527 --> 30:45.927
The training officer who
yelled "gun" at your shooting,

30:46.021 --> 30:47.322
was he ever prosecuted?

30:47.356 --> 30:49.214
News travels fast around here.

30:49.239 --> 30:50.700
Ah, we're like family.

30:51.145 --> 30:52.803
No, he wasn't, either.

30:52.861 --> 30:54.768
I'm not trying to bulldog you here.

30:54.793 --> 30:58.333
I'm just trying to get my head
around why a former cop

30:58.367 --> 31:01.102
who killed an unarmed teenager
and didn't get prosecuted is now

31:01.136 --> 31:03.905
- working cops.
- I'm not IA.

31:03.939 --> 31:05.573
I just go after bad guys.

31:05.608 --> 31:07.075
Well, Beck's a good guy.

31:09.545 --> 31:10.945
To good cops.

31:15.384 --> 31:17.285
So what's the deal with The Houses?

31:17.319 --> 31:18.252
What about them?

31:18.287 --> 31:19.420
I keep hearing

31:19.455 --> 31:21.856
it's like the Wild West down there.

31:21.890 --> 31:24.425
Personally, I never ran any tours there.

31:24.460 --> 31:26.260
- Tours?
- It's nothing, it's stupid.

31:26.295 --> 31:29.397
It's like a tour of duty... it's rough.

31:29.431 --> 31:30.865
Ashe Akino?

31:30.899 --> 31:32.634
Yes?

31:32.668 --> 31:33.968
You've been served.

31:45.948 --> 31:47.582
I don't understand.

31:47.957 --> 31:49.584
I don't understand.

31:50.020 --> 31:52.338
<i>I keep making excuses for you, Ashe.</i>

31:52.363 --> 31:53.784
<i>But I can't anymore.</i>

31:53.809 --> 31:58.326
<i>I don't think that you're okay.
I don't, I don't trust you.</i>

31:58.360 --> 32:00.061
I would never hurt Kai.

32:00.389 --> 32:02.664
I would never hurt her.

32:03.045 --> 32:04.217
<i>Look...</i>

32:04.242 --> 32:07.850
Okay, I-I'll get help,
I'll get help, I promise.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.598
<i>You've been saying that for a year.</i>

32:09.623 --> 32:10.794
- Javier...
- <i>We can't talk.</i>

32:10.819 --> 32:13.366
<i>We can't, we can't talk
about this anymore.</i>

32:13.540 --> 32:15.841
<i>You've got to talk to my lawyer.</i>

32:15.978 --> 32:20.415
Javier, she's the only thing
that makes sense.

32:20.449 --> 32:21.416
Please.

32:22.345 --> 32:23.718
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:23.752 --> 32:25.351
She's the only thing that makes sense.

32:25.376 --> 32:27.021
<i>She matters to me, too.</i>

32:39.415 --> 32:41.046
I'll bring you on the field,
bring you backstage,

32:41.071 --> 32:42.738
- the locker room, meet everybody.
- Oh, really?

32:42.772 --> 32:44.280
Yeah, no problem.

32:45.742 --> 32:47.643
So who tuned you up, baby bro?

32:47.677 --> 32:48.944
It's nothing, it's a little scrap.

32:48.979 --> 32:50.779
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

32:50.814 --> 32:52.473
Because you know I got people, right?

32:52.516 --> 32:54.850
You talking retaliation
in front of law enforcement?

32:54.885 --> 32:56.452
Girl, please, you too pretty
to be a cop.

32:56.486 --> 32:57.785
You too pretty to play ball.

32:59.988 --> 33:02.291
So, what, you dig cuffing brothers?

33:02.325 --> 33:05.440
I dig cuffing bad guys...
they come in all shades.

33:05.465 --> 33:06.699
Why?

33:06.736 --> 33:09.165
- Because I'm good at it.
- What makes you so good?

33:09.783 --> 33:12.568
I understand how easy it can happen,

33:12.705 --> 33:15.305
going down that other path.

33:16.173 --> 33:17.807
And I respect it.

33:19.387 --> 33:22.586
But I'm sure you prep school Negroes
have a different mindset.

33:22.611 --> 33:24.902
No, no, no, no.
Pres, he went to prep schools...

33:24.998 --> 33:27.283
- I'm a hood cat.
- You wear that like it's a badge.

33:27.324 --> 33:28.658
Hell yeah, fought for everything I got,

33:28.685 --> 33:30.352
ain't nothing was handed to me.

33:30.387 --> 33:32.755
- Trust me, you had it easier.
- Please.

33:32.789 --> 33:34.900
Do you know where this boy spent
his summers in high school?

33:34.925 --> 33:36.058
The Alps.

33:36.092 --> 33:37.843
His best friend's pop was a billionaire.

33:37.868 --> 33:40.547
But it's all good, because our parents
are living in a house...

33:40.743 --> 33:42.493
that I paid for.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.768
What's your shelf life, Mace?

33:45.802 --> 33:47.698
Five years?

33:47.723 --> 33:49.972
Look, I'll be running Justice by
then, and just getting started.

33:50.006 --> 33:51.473
Yeah, I saw you on TV.

33:51.508 --> 33:53.309
How is it you always end up
playing for the wrong team?

33:53.343 --> 33:55.210
It's funny how black folks
on the sidelines are always

33:55.245 --> 33:56.492
the ones questioning loyalty.

33:56.517 --> 33:57.804
I never played on no sidelines.

33:57.829 --> 33:58.881
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

33:58.915 --> 34:00.583
So, what, you think tweeting
"Black lives matter"

34:00.617 --> 34:03.018
to your million followers
makes you Jackie Robinson?

34:03.053 --> 34:06.188
1.4... and at least folks know
what side I'm on.

34:06.222 --> 34:08.556
Damn, I thought...

34:08.592 --> 34:11.260
I thought I missed out, being
an only child, but I guess not.

34:11.293 --> 34:12.962
Nah, we go.

34:14.598 --> 34:16.998
But it's all love.

34:17.033 --> 34:18.333
Right, baby bro?

34:18.368 --> 34:19.568
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

34:19.603 --> 34:20.569
All love.

34:20.603 --> 34:22.071
Look.

34:22.105 --> 34:23.706
Appreciate the meal.

34:25.275 --> 34:26.609
We've got work to do.

34:27.335 --> 34:30.328
I'm not walking away
from this $50 steak.

34:30.353 --> 34:31.976
It's all good... I'll take her home.

34:34.751 --> 34:36.500
See you tomorrow.

34:53.603 --> 34:56.705
I was surprised to get your text.

34:56.739 --> 34:58.540
You said I owe you.

34:58.575 --> 35:00.909
Actually, um, I owe you.

35:00.944 --> 35:02.344
How's that?

35:02.379 --> 35:06.148
Your speech was the lead story
on every statewide affiliate,

35:06.182 --> 35:09.243
and on the front page
of every local newspaper.

35:09.516 --> 35:13.102
And the governor is standing
right there next to you.

35:20.260 --> 35:21.779
Come on.

35:29.560 --> 35:30.506
<i>You're making me blush.</i>

35:30.540 --> 35:33.042
Really, under all that chocolate?

35:35.445 --> 35:38.947
You know he thinks we're
hitting it right now, right?

35:38.982 --> 35:40.249
So why aren't we?

35:40.687 --> 35:43.976
Because if we do, I won't respect you.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.789
And I think I like you.

35:46.823 --> 35:49.191
Maybe I don't want
to be liked right now.

35:51.895 --> 35:53.629
Wow.

35:53.663 --> 35:55.464
Girl, you sexy as hell.

35:55.498 --> 35:57.332
But you've got some of the saddest eyes

35:57.367 --> 35:59.702
I've ever seen.

35:59.736 --> 36:03.866
I don't know, maybe
that's why I'm digging you.

36:04.741 --> 36:06.875
I appreciate the sentiment,

36:06.910 --> 36:11.013
but, um, you sound like
a real bitch right now.

36:15.018 --> 36:17.071
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

36:44.981 --> 36:47.431
No, Shirlane, this is
not how things work.

36:47.541 --> 36:49.585
I don't give a damn about a heads up.

36:49.619 --> 36:50.986
That's too late.

36:51.011 --> 36:53.021
You're going to get me fired.

36:53.431 --> 36:55.457
When's it running?

36:56.693 --> 36:59.134
- What's going on?
- A video just hit.

36:59.159 --> 37:00.665
Of what?

37:00.690 --> 37:03.667
<i>But what is quite clear
are the racist remarks.</i>

37:03.692 --> 37:05.801
<i>Officials say those remarks
are from Joshua Beck,</i>

37:05.835 --> 37:08.237
<i>an African-American deputy.</i>

37:08.271 --> 37:09.805
<i>All right, fam.</i>

37:09.839 --> 37:11.740
<i>Just graduated from the Academy.</i>

37:11.775 --> 37:14.209
<i>Grown-ass man now. Any last words?</i>

37:14.244 --> 37:16.245
Uh, yeah.

37:16.279 --> 37:19.595
Um... finally got my license
to shoot these crackers.

37:19.620 --> 37:21.817
That's right, Josh.

37:21.851 --> 37:23.667
That's right, my boy's bulletproof.

37:23.692 --> 37:25.587
<i>Now, we've heard no comment
from Deputy Beck</i>

37:25.629 --> 37:27.081
<i>or the Gate Station Sheriff's Office</i>

37:27.106 --> 37:28.855
<i>regarding this inflammatory video.</i>

37:28.880 --> 37:29.747
Hello?

37:29.772 --> 37:32.278
<i>- Sources within the department say...
- Mm-hmm, yeah.</i>

37:41.159 --> 37:42.993
I was drunk, sir.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.841
Just, uh, popping off at the mouth.

37:45.866 --> 37:47.240
You know that's not how I really feel.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.576
Hell, I've said things
sober that'd get me fired.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.749
No one here's taking offense.

37:52.090 --> 37:54.258
Thank you, Kerry.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.211
What about the guys?

37:58.236 --> 38:01.578
Well, there's a box of saltines
on your desk with a bow on it.

38:05.013 --> 38:07.760
Unfortunately, the media's
not so forgiving.

38:07.887 --> 38:09.188
I can handle that.

38:09.213 --> 38:10.330
I know you can.

38:10.355 --> 38:13.090
But I think it's best we
keep you on administrative duty

38:13.124 --> 38:15.336
until these DOJ people
finish their investigation.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.619
- What?
- Daddy!

38:16.661 --> 38:18.395
Okay, little man.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.755
- Okay.
- Hello!

38:19.780 --> 38:20.898
Not right now, son.

38:20.932 --> 38:23.734
I'm sorry. Hey, I think you're
missing a shirt, little man.

38:25.019 --> 38:26.347
Sorry.

38:26.372 --> 38:27.438
Christian!

38:27.472 --> 38:29.021
There he goes.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.744
Look, it's not fair,

38:33.778 --> 38:35.813
but you're a distraction.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.481
It's gonna be impossible to do your job.

38:37.515 --> 38:40.184
Then I'll make a statement,
let the people hear from me.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.598
Josh, what did the union rep say to you?

38:42.623 --> 38:45.097
Under no circumstances
do you talk to the media.

38:45.770 --> 38:49.223
And this prosecutor,
you don't talk to him alone.

38:49.561 --> 38:53.497
And you never deviate from the language.

38:53.531 --> 38:56.367
"In the moment of engagement,
I feared for my life."

38:56.401 --> 38:58.702
- I did, sir.
- Good.

38:58.737 --> 39:00.337
The truth's easier to remember.

39:03.477 --> 39:04.720
Morning.

39:04.745 --> 39:06.492
- Have you seen the video?
- Not a good look.

39:06.517 --> 39:07.878
I've been in touch
with the governor's office.

39:07.912 --> 39:09.313
They want to know who leaked it.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.881
Me, too.

39:10.915 --> 39:12.116
I'll be ready in 20 minutes.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.785
Can I ask you a lawyer question?

39:14.819 --> 39:15.886
About another case?

39:15.920 --> 39:16.987
Yeah.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.989
- What's the grounds for sole custody?
- For which parent?

39:19.024 --> 39:21.158
- Does it matter?
- In some cases, yeah.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.293
The father.

39:23.328 --> 39:25.062
Proof the mother is unfit.

39:25.096 --> 39:26.497
Drugs, alcohol abuse.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.098
Threat to the safety of the child.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.801
Pattern of unaccountability.

39:30.835 --> 39:32.136
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.305
You know it didn't mean
anything to him, right?

39:37.942 --> 39:40.144
Didn't mean anything to me, either.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.016
Scripture tells us,
"Blessed are those that mourn,

39:46.051 --> 39:48.485
for they shall be comforted."

39:49.988 --> 39:53.757
Black America has been
in a state of mourning

39:53.792 --> 39:54.858
for far too long.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.194
Mourning the loss

39:57.228 --> 40:00.745
of so many of our sons
and daughters because the world

40:00.770 --> 40:02.809
has weaponized our blackness.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.368
In its eyes,

40:04.402 --> 40:05.769
we're never unarmed.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.966
And now we add another name.

40:09.874 --> 40:11.275
Joey Campbell.

40:11.309 --> 40:14.545
17 years old, killed two weeks ago.

40:14.579 --> 40:18.135
We heard about it in the way it's
always been, through whispers.

40:18.721 --> 40:20.984
But the world doesn't know.

40:21.019 --> 40:25.065
The world doesn't know, because
the police aren't investigating.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.346
But the world is gonna know.

40:29.260 --> 40:34.310
Church, I'm bringing up someone
who needs our support.

40:35.029 --> 40:38.029
Shameeka Campbell, his mother.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.343
Family.

40:46.377 --> 40:50.570
We know what it's like
to lose someone to the police.

40:50.595 --> 40:53.999
And we also know that two wrongs
don't make a right.

40:54.119 --> 40:57.054
Every parent wants their child home.

40:58.408 --> 41:03.178
So I'm bringing up another
mother who needs our support.

41:13.338 --> 41:14.938
Come on, church.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.273
The greatest of these is what?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.208
Love. How?

41:18.243 --> 41:21.245
We love our neighbor as ourself.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.048
This mother loved

41:25.083 --> 41:28.018
her child no less than anybody else.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.690
Family, let's be united.

41:30.799 --> 41:33.143
