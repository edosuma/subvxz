WEBVTT

00:06.697 --> 00:09.158
Get a move on, Dunc,
we need that fire going.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.494
That's my Savile Row suit.
I wear that!

00:11.577 --> 00:14.748
Then you can carry on wearing
it, if you don't mind
being stuffed and mounted.

00:14.831 --> 00:18.294
Oh, is nothing sacred?
People rifling
through your wardrobe.

00:18.378 --> 00:21.631
-Valuable early
editions going missing.
-What early editions?

00:21.714 --> 00:24.510
Kidnapped by
Robert Louis Stevenson.

00:25.511 --> 00:27.304
Your pen's run out.

00:28.681 --> 00:30.517
Ultraviolet ink. See?

00:31.893 --> 00:34.062
Do try to keep up
with technology, Archie.

00:34.145 --> 00:36.941
Since you're determined
to open our house to
the great unwashed,

00:37.024 --> 00:39.193
I'm marking everything
that isn't nailed down!

00:39.277 --> 00:42.072
It's not the whole house,
just this room.

00:42.155 --> 00:45.033
-There, what do you think?
-Ludicrous!

00:45.117 --> 00:47.202
Don't you realise
the aristocracy
needs mystique?

00:47.286 --> 00:50.290
The aristocracy needs funds.
Our next grant
cheque depends on this

00:50.373 --> 00:52.959
and I think we might
just get away with it.
Come along, out.

00:53.042 --> 00:55.588
No one goes in here
between now and...

00:55.671 --> 00:58.257
...and then we open the door
and take
the Heritage Committee

00:58.340 --> 01:01.011
back to the days of
our Victorian ancestors.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.929
(DUNCAN COUGHING)

01:11.480 --> 01:14.401
I think I should have
used a bigger sheet.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.665
They're casing
the joint in broad daylight!
Where are the dogs?

02:05.710 --> 02:08.547
Come on, boys,
get him, get him! Kill, kill!

02:16.056 --> 02:18.309
-Hello there.
-Honestly.

02:18.393 --> 02:20.812
I'd be better off
with a team of gerbils.

02:20.895 --> 02:22.146
Geordie!

02:23.439 --> 02:25.734
How wonderful to see you.

02:25.818 --> 02:29.446
-How are you doing, duchess?
-Hector, you remember Geordie?

02:29.530 --> 02:32.659
Your bookie, yes.
Business good, is it?

02:32.741 --> 02:35.120
I had to let the roller go.

02:35.203 --> 02:37.873
Ah, but you've
still got the shoes.

02:37.956 --> 02:42.045
Well, you look like a man
in need of refreshment.
Come along.

02:42.128 --> 02:45.507
In need of a good
horsewhipping if you ask me.

02:45.591 --> 02:50.096
Paintings, costumes, furniture
all caked in soot, ruined.

02:50.179 --> 02:53.558
-It's not funny, Katrina.
-No, sorry, of course not.

02:53.641 --> 02:57.146
I've called in a firm of
cleaners, but they can't make
it till the end of the week.

02:57.229 --> 03:00.150
We're never
going to open in time
and we need that grant.

03:00.233 --> 03:03.111
So, you want me to
nobble the council?

03:03.194 --> 03:05.948
-It's not about nobbling
the council, it's about...
-What?

03:06.032 --> 03:08.034
You never come to see me
unless you need something.

03:08.117 --> 03:11.454
-This tableau was
your stupid idea.
-It is not a stupid idea!

03:11.537 --> 03:14.124
I mean, who cares about
the life of
a laird 100 years ago?

03:14.207 --> 03:16.752
It's not as if
that much has changed
for you lot anyway.

03:16.835 --> 03:19.881
Apart from dry rot,
death duties
and the council tax, no.

03:19.964 --> 03:21.424
My heart bleeds.

03:21.507 --> 03:25.054
I suppose you'd rather I
restored a Victorian croft

03:25.137 --> 03:28.641
and set up some
twee little scene
with a noble son of the soil.

03:28.724 --> 03:33.188
Well, it'd have more relevance
than a load of
dummies in posh frocks.

03:34.522 --> 03:37.985
-Right, fine, okay.
-What?

03:38.069 --> 03:41.530
I will set up a tableau
in a Victorian croft.

03:41.614 --> 03:44.660
In 36 hours? Good luck.

03:44.743 --> 03:46.620
Thank you so
much for your help.

03:46.703 --> 03:48.915
FERGAL: Katrina? Hiya, boss.

03:50.917 --> 03:54.087
-Yours.
-Picked off the estate?

03:54.171 --> 03:57.967
-Then they're his.
-Is everything okay?

03:58.050 --> 03:59.718
The laird just had
some council business,

03:59.803 --> 04:01.805
but we're finished now,
aren't we, Archie?

04:01.888 --> 04:04.474
Oh, we are most
definitely finished.

04:11.315 --> 04:14.361
-Took me ages to find those.
-KATRINA: (LAUGHING) Sorry.

04:19.450 --> 04:21.911
No,
I don't want to go to a rave.

04:23.079 --> 04:24.873
It'll be fun!

04:24.957 --> 04:27.126
Two hours in
a clapped-out Land Rover,

04:27.208 --> 04:30.922
paying good
money to leap around
in the mud till my ears bleed?

04:31.006 --> 04:33.174
That's not my
idea of a dream date.

04:33.258 --> 04:36.304
Ah. But it wouldn't be a date.

04:36.387 --> 04:38.931
It would be two mates
out for a good time.

04:39.015 --> 04:42.394
Oh,
go on, Lex, what do you say?

04:42.477 --> 04:43.729
I say...

04:45.522 --> 04:48.568
lose the eye shadow,
it went out in the '80s.

04:51.404 --> 04:52.739
Thank you.

05:00.165 --> 05:03.251
Mmm! That's the first
I've eaten for a while.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.968
Lady luck ran out on me.
Took my worldly
possessions with her.

05:11.052 --> 05:13.138
You lost everything
on one horse?

05:13.221 --> 05:16.975
Not a horse, no.
Turn of the cards.

05:17.059 --> 05:20.188
-Not as sharp as I
used to be, it seems.
-How very sordid.

05:20.271 --> 05:22.273
Hector, please.

05:22.357 --> 05:26.278
I had to liquidate my
assets pretty quick.
The roller, my premises...

05:27.279 --> 05:29.281
My IOU's.

05:29.365 --> 05:30.992
Oh, I see.

05:31.076 --> 05:32.911
I had to pass
them on, I'm sorry.

05:32.994 --> 05:36.165
-You mean you
owe this man money?
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

05:36.248 --> 05:40.711
Molly's always
settled her debts.
He cleaned me out, Molly.

05:40.795 --> 05:43.966
-Who did exactly?
-His name's Murdo.

05:44.049 --> 05:46.801
He owns
a nightclub called The Knave.

05:46.885 --> 05:49.889
Big poker game at the back.
Big money.

05:49.973 --> 05:52.392
How much money does
Molly owe this Mr Murdo?

05:52.475 --> 05:55.771
We'll come to some
arrangement. I'm sure he's
a reasonable man.

05:55.854 --> 05:57.230
Depends what you mean
by reasonable.

05:57.314 --> 06:00.694
Tell me, where are you
staying in the meantime?

06:00.777 --> 06:02.529
Oh, here and there.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.240
Oh, Geordie,
you don't mean to say
you're sleeping in that van?

06:05.323 --> 06:09.245
It's
surprisingly well appointed
and the views are fabulous.

06:09.328 --> 06:12.040
You must stay here till
you're back on your feet.

06:12.124 --> 06:14.167
I wouldn't want to
impose on your hospitality.

06:14.251 --> 06:17.504
-Ah, what a shame.
Lovely seeing you.
-I insist.

06:17.587 --> 06:21.551
-I don't want to
be any trouble.
-You won't. Will he, Hector?

06:24.096 --> 06:26.724
If you'll excuse me,

06:26.807 --> 06:29.351
I'm just going to
count the spoons.

06:35.525 --> 06:38.237
GOLLY:
Now this could be the place
you want, Archie.

06:38.321 --> 06:40.823
The roof's still on.
The walls are sound.

06:40.906 --> 06:45.662
It's not too far from the road
so the punters won't
have to get their feet wet.

06:45.746 --> 06:50.960
Plus the Jacuzzi is full
of oysters and the cable TV
is on the blink.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.757
-Am I some kind
of dinosaur, Golly?
-What?

06:54.840 --> 06:59.929
Am I some grasping feudal
tyrant desperate to bleed
the peasants dry?

07:00.013 --> 07:02.891
-Why don't you ask Katrina?
-Yeah, right.

07:02.974 --> 07:07.063
As if I give a toss about her
opinion. As if I care about
anything she says.

07:07.146 --> 07:08.773
(GOLLY LAUGHING)

07:09.774 --> 07:10.941
What?

07:11.025 --> 07:15.322
Oh, methinks the laird
doth protest too much.

07:15.405 --> 07:19.952
Look, I couldn't care less
about her and she feels just
the same about me.

07:20.036 --> 07:22.789
She would much rather hang out
with the wild
man of the woods.

07:22.872 --> 07:26.043
-Fergal? Don't think so.
-And he is welcome to her.

07:26.126 --> 07:29.463
In fact, a tenner says
they'll get it together
by the end of the week.

07:29.546 --> 07:31.508
Archie.

07:31.591 --> 07:35.136
I'll throw in a few
words of encouragement.
They'll hardly even notice.

07:35.220 --> 07:38.182
And then she'll be out of
my hair once and for all.

07:38.265 --> 07:40.977
So,
she's in your hair, is she?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.897
You don't think
I can manage it?

07:43.981 --> 07:47.902
-All right, 20 to your 10.
-I'll take the bet.

07:47.986 --> 07:52.782
But believe me,
son, you're going to lose.

07:52.865 --> 07:56.453
ARCHIE:In the meantime, all we
have to do is transform this
into a tourist attraction.

07:56.537 --> 08:00.875
Ah, well, good luck.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.878
-Golly!
-Listen, son,
it's not a gillie you need.

08:03.962 --> 08:06.173
It's a shrink.

08:06.257 --> 08:08.300
I've got beasts to feed.

08:47.471 --> 08:49.349
Can I help you, hen?

08:49.432 --> 08:54.313
-I'm looking for a Mr Murdo.
-And what business
do you have with him?

08:54.395 --> 08:56.774
My friend Geordie owes
him some money.

08:56.857 --> 08:59.276
Go home, doll.
You don't belong here.

09:01.112 --> 09:04.366
Stitches,
who's your girlfriend?

09:04.449 --> 09:08.746
The name is Molly MacDonald.
I'm a friend of Geordie's.

09:08.829 --> 09:11.290
Ah, you're Mrs MacDonald?

09:11.374 --> 09:14.002
-How do you do?
-Hello, what can I do for you?

09:14.086 --> 09:17.464
Don't worry about them.
We have no secrets.

09:17.548 --> 09:21.052
I understand that
you've taken over
Geordie's business?

09:21.135 --> 09:24.515
I am administering his
accounts, that's correct.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.810
Well, he laid a lot
of bets on my behalf.

09:27.893 --> 09:30.480
Yes, he was very reluctant
to pass on your details.

09:30.563 --> 09:34.317
I understand there's a sum
of Â£4,000 outstanding.

09:34.401 --> 09:39.323
-Well, actually, it's three.
-Actually,
it was three, last week.

09:39.407 --> 09:42.911
I'm a businessman,
Mrs MacDonald, I like to
encourage prompt repayment.

09:42.995 --> 09:44.913
You will be repaid, I promise.

09:44.997 --> 09:46.999
I don't run the business
on promises.

09:47.082 --> 09:50.461
-It's strictly cash only.
-Mr Murdo, I am not
the sort of person...

09:50.545 --> 09:54.258
I don't care what
sort of person you are.

09:54.341 --> 09:58.178
Well, surely we can
come to some arrangement?

09:58.262 --> 10:02.726
Tell you what,
you can work in the kitchen,
help with the washing up.

10:04.769 --> 10:08.524
Thank you for
your time, Mr Murdo.
I'll be in touch.

10:16.575 --> 10:20.163
FERGAL: This place stinks.
ARCHIE: Yep, it's authentic.

10:20.246 --> 10:23.751
It is possible to
overdo the authenticity.

10:23.834 --> 10:26.754
Thanks for mucking in
with the mucking out.

10:26.837 --> 10:30.467
Actually,
I wanted to pick your brains.

10:30.550 --> 10:33.136
It's pretty lean
pickings up there, I'm afraid.

10:33.219 --> 10:35.473
You've known Katrina
for quite a while now,
haven't you?

10:35.556 --> 10:37.016
Yeah, since we were kids.

10:37.099 --> 10:39.810
Only I need some
inside information.

10:39.894 --> 10:42.856
You know,
on her likes and dislikes.

10:42.939 --> 10:45.150
I want to wow her.

10:45.233 --> 10:47.361
Wow her or woo her?

10:47.444 --> 10:51.532
Wow or woo... I think both.

10:51.616 --> 10:56.747
I've got a really good
feeling about this, Archie.
I don't want to blow it.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.501
She did not go for
those flowers I gave her.

10:59.584 --> 11:04.297
She doesn't like cut flowers,
she says she's always
waiting for them to die.

11:04.381 --> 11:09.095
She's very fond of trees.
Poplar, silver birch.

11:09.178 --> 11:11.890
A tree. A tree, of course.

11:17.563 --> 11:19.732
I thought you
two didn't get on?

11:19.816 --> 11:21.984
Whatever gave you that idea?

11:22.068 --> 11:25.030
Nothing. Thanks a lot, Arch.

11:32.747 --> 11:34.499
(BAGPIPES PLAYING)

12:33.026 --> 12:35.070
Oh, that looks fabulous.

12:36.197 --> 12:39.867
Have you any brown sauce? HP?

12:39.950 --> 12:41.745
I'll go and have a look.

12:41.828 --> 12:45.540
-Quite a selection.
-Don't they have
cutlery in Kilmarnock?

12:47.125 --> 12:49.921
-Just start from
the outside and work in.
-Oh, really?

12:50.004 --> 12:53.884
-Molly? I'll go and
fetch another plate.
-Thank you, Lexie.

12:55.969 --> 12:58.639
Where have you been all day?

12:58.722 --> 13:00.850
I've been to see Mr Murdo.

13:02.018 --> 13:03.853
He wants me
to repay him this week.

13:03.937 --> 13:05.731
So what's the problem?
Pay the man.

13:05.815 --> 13:09.568
Hector, it's Â£4,000!

13:09.652 --> 13:13.240
Â£4,000! How in heaven's name
are we going to tell Archie?

13:13.323 --> 13:17.578
-Do we have to tell Archie?
-Mmm, smells good.

13:17.662 --> 13:22.250
-Oh, I wish I could
say the same about you.
-Thank you.

13:22.333 --> 13:25.379
-Hello, Geordie, how are you?
-Oh, I'm fine.

13:25.462 --> 13:27.589
Geordie's staying with
us for a little while.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.676
ARCHIE: Right, good.

13:29.759 --> 13:32.595
Would you like me to
hose you down before dinner?

13:32.679 --> 13:36.517
No, I can't stay.
I'll just have a sandwich
or something, please.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.310
All right, m'lord.

13:47.697 --> 13:49.866
-Everything all right?
-Splendid, splendid.

13:49.949 --> 13:52.201
Only we seem to have
run out of brown sauce.

13:52.285 --> 13:55.539
No, that's all right.
I'll make do with ketchup.

13:57.124 --> 13:59.251
Right. I'll leave you to it.

15:03.284 --> 15:04.869
You're up early.

15:04.953 --> 15:08.416
-Got lots to do.
-No rest for
the Lone Ranger, eh?

15:10.042 --> 15:13.296
Not until Archie's
croft is finished, no.

15:13.380 --> 15:18.845
So, what do you do for
relaxation, kemo sabe?

15:18.928 --> 15:23.517
Ride into the village
and show all
the girls your six-gun?

15:23.600 --> 15:28.105
-I usually read a book.
-Oh, an intellectual.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.734
I like a man with
a bulging cortex.

15:32.277 --> 15:35.239
So, would you like to
go to work on an egg?

15:37.491 --> 15:42.664
Thanks. Maybe Duncan
would be up for that.

15:44.249 --> 15:48.254
And what will Tonto be having?
Soft-boiled with soldiers?

15:48.337 --> 15:51.591
What was all that about?
You were coming on to him!

15:51.674 --> 15:55.220
And what's that
got to do with you?
I thought we were just mates.

15:55.304 --> 15:57.639
Aye, right, we are, but...

15:57.723 --> 16:01.102
I was thinking about
asking him to this rave.
What do you think?

16:01.186 --> 16:03.271
I mean, speaking as mates.

16:04.105 --> 16:05.441
Why not?

16:06.484 --> 16:09.612
Go on. Ask away!

16:13.617 --> 16:15.660
What about your soldiers?

16:17.497 --> 16:19.207
They're dismissed.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.378
You do not throw these out!

16:25.923 --> 16:29.511
Put this in there and
you charge six quid a shot.

16:29.594 --> 16:33.098
Anybody complains,
you refer them
to Stitches, okay?

16:33.181 --> 16:34.974
Mr Murdo.

16:35.058 --> 16:38.104
Oh, hello.
Did bring your Marigolds?

16:38.187 --> 16:40.689
No, but I've brought you this.

16:40.773 --> 16:43.860
-What's it worth?
-To me, it's priceless.

16:43.944 --> 16:46.571
To you, about Â£4,000.

16:46.655 --> 16:47.782
Well, let's see what
the jeweller says.

16:47.865 --> 16:49.867
Well, actually,
before you take it,

16:49.951 --> 16:52.161
I have
a proposition to put to you.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.207
You're not just a businessman,
are you, Mr Murdo?

16:55.290 --> 16:57.501
You're an entrepreneur,
a risk taker.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.547
I mean,
I could just hand this over
and you could sell it,

17:00.630 --> 17:02.966
but where would be
the thrill in that?

17:03.049 --> 17:05.845
You like cards,
let's play poker for it.

17:07.471 --> 17:10.015
-Do you know
how to play poker?
-Oh, yes.

17:10.098 --> 17:12.935
It's rather like bridge,
isn't it?

17:13.019 --> 17:16.857
It's my money.
Why would I want to
play cards for it?

17:16.940 --> 17:20.278
Mr Murdo, anyone
would think you lacked...
What do you call it?

17:20.361 --> 17:21.570
Bottle.

17:23.615 --> 17:24.907
Right.

17:25.784 --> 17:27.578
Your house. Tonight.

17:28.912 --> 17:30.665
-My house?
-Ah.

17:30.749 --> 17:35.379
His Lordship doesn't know
about your expensive habits,
does he?

17:35.463 --> 17:38.507
Shall we say 7:30?

17:38.591 --> 17:41.595
Bring some friends if you
like. Oh, and black tie.

17:41.678 --> 17:44.306
Of course.
Appearances are so important,
aren't they?

17:44.389 --> 17:48.019
They certainly are.
Even if you're
just selling whisky.

17:52.440 --> 17:55.569
-Why did you agree?
-I've got nothing to lose.

17:58.405 --> 18:00.115
She's got plenty.

18:06.999 --> 18:09.542
What about furniture?

18:09.627 --> 18:11.463
I'll have to fill up
a trailer at the house.

18:11.546 --> 18:13.590
-Once we fix the floor.
-And strip the panels.

18:13.673 --> 18:15.967
-And rebuild the fire.
-And paint the place.

18:16.051 --> 18:17.929
This is insane.

18:21.390 --> 18:23.936
-Hello.
-Oh, great.
That's all we need.

18:24.019 --> 18:27.189
Don't worry, it's not
an official inspection.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.398
(EXCLAIMS)

18:28.482 --> 18:31.986
Good thing, too.
Hums a bit, doesn't it?

18:32.070 --> 18:34.531
Unless,
of course, it's you two.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.951
Did you want something?

18:37.034 --> 18:39.829
I wanted to see
Fergal actually.

18:39.912 --> 18:41.623
Right, excuse me.

18:46.253 --> 18:48.840
Now, somebody...

18:50.633 --> 18:54.012
planted a silver birch
outside my house last night.

18:54.805 --> 18:57.349
Right.

18:57.433 --> 19:01.312
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'll come over
straightaway and dig it up.

19:01.396 --> 19:03.648
Stop. It's beautiful.

19:05.985 --> 19:08.237
How did you know?

19:08.320 --> 19:12.200
It reminded me of you,
lithe and bright...

19:14.202 --> 19:15.454
and beautiful.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.208
It's funny that.

19:19.292 --> 19:22.795
-'Cause you
remind me of an oak.
-Do I now?

19:22.879 --> 19:25.924
Dense and knobbly
and full of squirrels.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.634
(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:31.473 --> 19:36.771
It's all right. Don't worry,
I'll get a pane of glass.

19:36.854 --> 19:39.565
I thought you were
trying to fix the place up,
not demolish it.

19:39.648 --> 19:42.319
It's not easy with
you two canoodling.

19:42.402 --> 19:44.362
We were not canoodling.

19:46.198 --> 19:49.786
He planted a silver
birch outside my house.

19:49.869 --> 19:54.374
That is the single
most romantic thing
anyone has ever done for me.

19:54.458 --> 19:56.376
Please,
don't try and spoil it.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.798
I'm not trying to spoil it.
Fergal is a lovely guy.

19:59.881 --> 20:01.925
He deserves a lovely...

20:04.177 --> 20:07.681
I'd better go and see
where that glass is.

20:07.765 --> 20:09.892
I can't believe you
invited that hoodlum here!

20:09.975 --> 20:12.020
I got into this mess,
I'll get us out of it.

20:12.104 --> 20:14.356
Molly, you can't do this.
He's a cardshark.

20:14.439 --> 20:17.568
I am not giving in
without a fight, Geordie.

20:17.652 --> 20:20.404
-I'm sorry I ever
got you involved.
-Apology accepted.

20:20.488 --> 20:23.408
Perhaps you'll climb back into
that dreary charabanc
of yours and disappear.

20:23.492 --> 20:25.536
No, Hector,
I need Geordie to help me.

20:25.619 --> 20:27.412
-Don't you think
he's helped enough?
-Please.

20:27.496 --> 20:30.250
I'm going to
play for my pendant
and clear my debt.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.336
I don't need you two
sniping at each other.

20:33.419 --> 20:35.673
Now, what are we going
to do about Archie?

20:35.756 --> 20:37.633
You won't have to do anything.

20:37.716 --> 20:40.553
He's so busy with that croft,
he wouldn't notice if
the house burned down.

20:40.636 --> 20:42.889
Good. So, let's get to work.

21:07.585 --> 21:11.339
No, Hector, no, no. Leave it,
leave it. I'll do it.

21:16.928 --> 21:18.681
There we are. Easy.

21:41.958 --> 21:44.878
That cheeky... That's my car!

22:16.958 --> 22:19.710
Good evening, Mr Murdo.

22:19.794 --> 22:22.672
Old MacDonald's farm, eh?
Very nice.

22:22.755 --> 22:26.176
This is my husband, Hector.
Geordie you know.

22:26.260 --> 22:29.597
You take in the homeless.
That's very noble.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.600
These are my good friends,
Hugh, Benny.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.354
Would you gentlemen care for
something to eat
after your journey?

22:35.437 --> 22:39.483
Maybe later, eh?
Let's get straight down
to business, shall we?

22:47.410 --> 22:49.787
Gentlemen,
do please follow me.

22:52.290 --> 22:55.836
-You've fallen on
somebody's fear, Geordie.
-I'm very lucky.

22:55.919 --> 22:58.005
Mrs MacDonald's a good friend.

22:58.088 --> 23:01.259
She's gonna need a bit
of luck herself tonight.

23:01.342 --> 23:04.471
I've been looking for
a little place in the country.

23:07.224 --> 23:09.727
Here, Jimmy, hang that up.

23:09.810 --> 23:11.855
Coat hooks are over there.

23:14.441 --> 23:16.234
I'm not the butler.

23:33.797 --> 23:35.716
Would you gentlemen
care for some whisky?

23:35.800 --> 23:38.010
Not for me, thanks.
I like to keep a clear head.

23:38.093 --> 23:39.804
Aye, yes, please.

23:41.681 --> 23:42.849
Thanks.

23:45.894 --> 23:50.608
-Oh, we do have cards already.
-Well, your house, my deck.

23:50.691 --> 23:53.654
If it's all the same to you?

23:53.737 --> 23:59.160
Oh, this is exciting. It's so
long since we've had
friends round for cards.

23:59.244 --> 24:03.665
Right, ante is Â£10, under
the gun, there's a straddle
option to 40 quid,

24:03.748 --> 24:07.795
check and raise is permitted,
the maximum bet is the size of
the pot or 1,000 quid,

24:07.878 --> 24:10.841
whichever is less,
the game's table stakes,

24:10.924 --> 24:13.385
the minimum buy-in
is five grand, okay?

24:13.468 --> 24:16.596
Don't worry about me.
I'll try and keep up.

24:39.081 --> 24:44.254
-What's going on?
-Molly's new business plan,
Glenbogle casino.

24:44.337 --> 24:47.049
-Only don't tell Archie.
-I just came to
get us some food.

24:47.133 --> 24:50.052
Help yourself.
To anything you see.

24:56.727 --> 24:59.856
That's not enough
for a growing boy.

24:59.939 --> 25:02.484
You need to keep
your strength up.

25:03.943 --> 25:06.572
-What do you have in mind?
-Well...

25:06.655 --> 25:10.117
there's a rave up at
Glenmorrison at the weekend.

25:10.201 --> 25:15.790
And I was thinking that you
and I could go and get sweaty?

25:17.418 --> 25:19.962
I'd love to.

25:20.046 --> 25:22.883
But I don't know
if it sounds like
Katrina's scene, you know.

25:22.966 --> 25:24.218
Katrina?

25:25.177 --> 25:28.263
Yeah, me and her are...

25:28.347 --> 25:33.019
-Sorry, I thought
Duncan might have told you.
-No. No, he didn't.

25:35.689 --> 25:37.066
Katrina?

25:38.984 --> 25:43.031
-Gets about a bit that one!
-I'm sorry?

25:43.114 --> 25:44.908
Oh, nothing.

25:44.991 --> 25:48.412
Is there something
I should know about?
Or some...one?

25:48.496 --> 25:51.582
Look,
forget I said anything, okay?

25:51.666 --> 25:53.627
-Is it Duncan?
-Oh, please.

25:53.710 --> 25:55.921
She has got some taste.

25:56.004 --> 25:59.133
Come on, Lexie, you can't go
dropping hints
all over the place.

25:59.217 --> 26:04.556
Look, I just thought that
there was something going on
between her and Archie.

26:04.639 --> 26:07.476
Obviously,
I was imagining things.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.769
Archie?

26:11.231 --> 26:14.734
MOLLY: Well,
Hugh, I'll raise you 25.

26:18.906 --> 26:20.867
-And 50.
-MURDO: See it.

26:26.748 --> 26:30.170
-Any raise?
-Why not?

26:30.253 --> 26:32.088
Another 50.

26:32.172 --> 26:34.215
Oh, this is fun, isn't it?

26:36.093 --> 26:37.344
See ya.

26:38.846 --> 26:40.472
Queens and tens.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.477
Aces and jacks.

26:48.232 --> 26:53.655
Doesn't that mean I win?
Gosh, I'm doing
rather well, aren't I?

26:53.739 --> 26:55.908
Beginner's luck, I suppose.

27:06.921 --> 27:08.088
Hmm.

27:10.759 --> 27:13.929
This place looks almost cosy.

27:14.012 --> 27:17.183
You and Fergal have
done a fantastic job.

27:17.266 --> 27:20.186
Yeah, he's a good
man to have around.

27:20.269 --> 27:21.729
Yeah, he is.

27:24.525 --> 27:28.612
Listen. I'm sorry
about what I said earlier.

27:29.697 --> 27:32.158
About you trying
to spoil things.

27:33.243 --> 27:35.204
I know you wouldn't.

27:35.287 --> 27:40.459
It's funny, no matter how much
coal I put on, it never seems
to get any warmer.

27:40.543 --> 27:43.213
Maybe it's
the spirit of Kilfedder.

27:45.674 --> 27:47.301
Kilfedder?

27:47.385 --> 27:51.472
The man who used to live here.
He was
the Glenbogle matchmaker.

27:51.556 --> 27:54.685
What, you mean this place
used to be a dating agency?

27:54.768 --> 27:56.520
Yeah.

27:56.603 --> 27:59.983
People used to come from miles
around to get advice
and find partners.

28:00.066 --> 28:02.819
But his family don't
still live in Glenbogle,
do they?

28:02.902 --> 28:05.573
He had no family.
He never married.

28:05.656 --> 28:07.074
Oh, ironic.

28:09.827 --> 28:12.873
There was a girl apparently.

28:12.956 --> 28:16.543
They were
childhood sweethearts.
But they fell out.

28:18.754 --> 28:20.423
No one knows why.

28:22.383 --> 28:27.181
Then years later,
her father
decided to marry her off

28:27.264 --> 28:30.643
to a rich Glasgow shopkeeper.
Kilfedder arranged it.

28:31.936 --> 28:34.272
Even though he
still loved her.

28:37.776 --> 28:40.154
He thought she'd gone off him.

28:42.699 --> 28:45.577
And he wanted her to
be happy, I suppose.

28:49.665 --> 28:51.709
But it didn't work out.

28:53.462 --> 28:57.257
Her husband dumped her,
and she died in a poorhouse.

29:00.094 --> 29:05.267
They found a letter to
Kilfedder in her belongings
and sent it on to him.

29:08.896 --> 29:12.692
It said she'd
always loved him,

29:12.776 --> 29:16.363
and that it broke her heart
that he'd abandoned her.

29:23.288 --> 29:24.748
He died here.

29:26.583 --> 29:30.171
Look at me, I'm crying.
It's all ancient history.

29:32.840 --> 29:37.012
-Katrina, look, I...
-Look at the year, 1901.

29:37.096 --> 29:38.681
I'd better go.

29:41.726 --> 29:44.604
-I'll see you tomorrow anyway.
-See you.

30:04.712 --> 30:07.298
Oh, look. There he is.

30:07.381 --> 30:09.633
Mr Total Recall.

30:09.717 --> 30:11.720
I suppose you
think that was funny.

30:11.803 --> 30:14.848
Sorry. Whatever it is,
I've forgotten.

30:14.931 --> 30:19.353
Like you forgot to
tell me that Fergal
was mixed up with Goldilocks!

30:19.437 --> 30:21.147
You let me ask him out!

30:21.230 --> 30:24.860
I feel about this big.
Do you know what
that feels like?

30:25.777 --> 30:27.946
I should do.

30:28.030 --> 30:30.283
You do it to me often enough.

30:55.187 --> 30:59.734
Hector, this is lunacy.
Has Molly ever
even played poker?

30:59.817 --> 31:03.863
Once or twice.
Monte Carlo, Las Vegas.

31:03.947 --> 31:06.033
She qualified for a
professional tournament once,

31:06.116 --> 31:08.869
but it clashed
with the Chelsea Flower Show.

31:08.953 --> 31:10.246
HUGH: Two.

31:19.924 --> 31:21.467
Three, please.

31:23.887 --> 31:24.930
Two.

31:26.890 --> 31:28.643
Two for the dealer.

31:43.827 --> 31:46.497
How did you end up
working for a creep like that?

31:46.581 --> 31:49.375
Not many openings for
hard men these days.

31:49.458 --> 31:51.711
And no
self-respect on the dole.

31:51.794 --> 31:55.424
Can you have self-respect
working for a guy like that?

31:55.507 --> 31:57.718
I do an honest day's work.

31:57.801 --> 32:00.889
We can't all graft for
nice folks like yours.

32:00.972 --> 32:03.975
So Murdo's honest, is he?

32:04.058 --> 32:07.688
He's a good card player.
And he plays to win.

32:07.771 --> 32:10.483
Nah,
he plays to fleece people.

32:12.736 --> 32:15.780
I've never made
anyone sit down with him,

32:15.864 --> 32:19.410
but I've made
them pay their debts
when they stand up.

32:21.495 --> 32:25.042
-Raise your 50.
-Mmm-hmm. And 100.

32:28.170 --> 32:29.839
Too steep for me.

32:32.634 --> 32:35.137
MURDO: Maybe you should
pull out now, Your Ladyship.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.766
I mean,
you've squandered your lead.
Three grand down.

32:39.975 --> 32:42.229
But don't feel bad about it.

32:42.979 --> 32:44.564
It's a class act.

32:44.648 --> 32:48.194
"Lady of the manor."
Drew me in at the start,
but you see,

32:48.277 --> 32:51.864
every time you bluff,
the corner of
your mouth goes up.

32:53.575 --> 32:57.537
The "naughty schoolgirl" look,
it's a dead giveaway.

32:57.621 --> 33:02.001
Well, some people smile,
Mr Murdo,
and some people talk.

33:03.086 --> 33:04.630
Raise you 100.

33:09.343 --> 33:10.595
(SIGHS)

33:12.722 --> 33:14.683
You think I'm bluffing?

33:17.019 --> 33:18.229
Thousand.

33:19.855 --> 33:22.401
That's your limit,
Your Ladyship.

33:25.362 --> 33:27.406
Time for some collateral.

33:52.477 --> 33:54.980
Full house. Kings over tens.

34:01.571 --> 34:03.114
Aces on jacks.

34:14.418 --> 34:18.841
You know, I'm not
really a pendant sort of guy.

34:18.925 --> 34:23.013
But I do know this lap dancer,
it'd just fit
right in her navel.

34:25.306 --> 34:27.266
Looks like we're quits.

34:28.645 --> 34:30.980
Unless you want
a chance to win it back.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.152
Oh, great.
If we can both get started...

34:36.235 --> 34:38.280
Actually, I wanted to
discuss my job description.

34:38.364 --> 34:40.199
Look, it's great of
you to help out...

34:40.283 --> 34:42.409
Yeah, helping with the croft,
no problem.

34:42.494 --> 34:46.415
And the ranger part,
that's fine too.

34:46.498 --> 34:51.920
But I draw the line at playing
the schmuck for you
and your girlfriend.

34:52.004 --> 34:55.467
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking
about you and Katrina.

34:55.550 --> 34:59.430
I'm talking about this lover's
charade where you have
me planting trees

34:59.514 --> 35:02.433
-and she acts all surprised.
-We are not lovers.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.521
I'm not blind, Archie.
I've just seen
you two together.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.691
Listen, Fergal,
there is nothing going on
between me and Katrina.

35:08.774 --> 35:11.903
We are just
friends and that's all.
She helped me out with a grant

35:11.987 --> 35:15.573
and with the accounts,
and she was there for
me when Justine left...

35:15.657 --> 35:17.702
-Really?
-And I helped
her get over Alan.

35:17.785 --> 35:20.204
And how exactly
did you do that?

35:21.122 --> 35:22.666
You haven't...

35:22.749 --> 35:25.544
No! We've never
spent the night together.

35:25.627 --> 35:30.008
Well, hardly ever. There
was that one time when
the car broke down, but...

35:31.509 --> 35:34.972
-It's a long story.
-Yeah, some other time.

35:36.849 --> 35:39.643
Thanks for
putting me straight.

35:39.727 --> 35:44.316
Fergal. What about the...
Oh, brilliant!

35:48.529 --> 35:51.949
Just look at him.
Smug little slug in a suit.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.663
Molly,
this has gone far enough.

35:56.746 --> 35:58.874
He's got my pendant,
the one you gave me.

35:58.958 --> 36:01.586
Then the debt is settled.

36:01.669 --> 36:03.922
Darling, let it go.
The pendant
doesn't really matter.

36:04.004 --> 36:08.135
It matters to me.
I know he's cheating,
but I don't know how.

36:08.217 --> 36:11.222
Molly, this is not
about the pendant.

36:11.305 --> 36:15.894
Murdo wants you angry and
desperate to break even so he
can take you to the cleaners.

36:15.977 --> 36:20.190
-Murdo ruined you!
-And I don't want
that happening to you.

36:20.273 --> 36:25.030
You're out of your depth.
Hector's right.
Get out now, please.

36:25.113 --> 36:27.950
I suppose it would be
the sensible thing to do,
I just wish...

36:28.033 --> 36:31.412
-What?
-I just wish I felt
like being sensible.

36:32.455 --> 36:33.665
Molly.

36:37.503 --> 36:39.046
I'm really sorry about this,
Hector.

36:39.129 --> 36:40.757
Don't be, old man,
you did your best.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.175
Besides, she might
still pull it off.

36:42.258 --> 36:44.719
Not against Murdo,
she won't, no.

36:44.803 --> 36:47.348
-I'm telling you,
the man's a mind-reader.
-Impossible.

36:47.431 --> 36:50.226
I've lived with
Molly for 40 years,
she's still a mystery to me.

36:50.309 --> 36:55.357
Not to Murdo she's not.
I'll tell you, he can
see things nobody else can.

37:19.302 --> 37:22.054
I... I spoke to Archie.

37:23.682 --> 37:26.059
He told me about
the two of you.

37:26.893 --> 37:29.689
Told you what?

37:29.772 --> 37:34.612
How you dumped your boyfriend
for him, that night in the
road, in the car.

37:34.695 --> 37:38.824
-You know, stuff like that.
-Are you serious?

37:38.907 --> 37:42.579
-Katrina,
I saw you and him together.
-Doing what?

37:44.748 --> 37:49.045
Look, whatever he's
told you, it's not true.

37:49.128 --> 37:52.841
There's nothing
between him and me.
There never has been.

37:54.509 --> 37:57.804
-I want to believe you.
-Then do.

37:59.724 --> 38:02.894
Look, everything's changed
since you've been around.

38:04.355 --> 38:06.732
Things are so open.

38:09.610 --> 38:12.697
I'm tired of people not
saying what they feel.

38:13.490 --> 38:15.700
Archie's so mixed up.

38:15.784 --> 38:18.371
I mean, one night he
came here to dinner

38:18.454 --> 38:20.873
and was trying to say
something and couldn't,

38:20.957 --> 38:24.086
and then we nearly kissed
and I spilt wine in his lap...

38:24.169 --> 38:25.837
When was this?

38:25.921 --> 38:28.424
Oh, ages ago. Weeks ago.

38:28.508 --> 38:29.676
I'm sure he told you about it.

38:29.759 --> 38:32.470
No. He never mentioned
it at all.

38:34.013 --> 38:35.224
Fergal.

38:36.433 --> 38:37.643
Fergal.

38:38.268 --> 38:39.728
Three, please.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.525
Two.

38:45.485 --> 38:48.656
MURDO: Stay.
Dealer takes three.

38:58.041 --> 38:59.502
Can you open?

39:00.586 --> 39:01.963
Yes, I can.

39:02.630 --> 39:04.091
For Â£10,000.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.511
That's way over the pot!

39:07.594 --> 39:10.890
If you're scared
to owe me that much,
I'll settle for my pendant.

39:10.974 --> 39:14.019
You said yourself it
doesn't really suit you.

39:20.234 --> 39:23.363
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

39:26.700 --> 39:28.244
Right.

39:28.328 --> 39:32.582
The bet is
Â£10,000 on this hand.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.552
Full house, aces on tens.

39:57.861 --> 40:00.740
Sorry. Tell you what...

40:03.034 --> 40:04.703
double or quits.

40:27.062 --> 40:29.107
I'll pay you next week.

40:30.233 --> 40:31.526
Stitches?

40:40.495 --> 40:43.707
Stitches, the lady's trying
to wriggle out of
her obligations.

40:43.790 --> 40:47.211
Oh, sorry, noblesse oblige.

40:47.294 --> 40:51.215
The terms are cash or goods.
Right now.

40:51.298 --> 40:54.136
Now just hold on a wee minute.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.805
It's all right, Golly.

40:56.888 --> 41:01.144
Well, time to settle up.
You'll take a cheque?

41:01.227 --> 41:03.271
I'm allergic to rubber.

41:03.354 --> 41:08.319
If that cheque bounces,
it's not my problem, it's his.
10,000, please.

41:08.402 --> 41:11.406
-Made out to Mr Murdo?
-Nah,
just leave the name blank.

41:11.489 --> 41:13.283
Certainly.

41:13.366 --> 41:15.493
Where did I put
that blasted pen?

41:15.577 --> 41:19.040
Oh. Have you've
seen one of these?
Frightfully clever.

41:25.380 --> 41:28.593
I say, these cards
of yours valuable?

41:28.676 --> 41:31.763
Look, they're marked
with ultraviolet ink.

41:40.065 --> 41:46.322
After all I've done for you,
I should have known.
So much for nobility.

41:46.405 --> 41:50.368
-I'm taking my
cheque and I'm going.
-I don't think so.

41:50.451 --> 41:52.496
Suit yourself. Stitches.

41:58.378 --> 41:59.587
Hey.

42:04.593 --> 42:06.178
UV sensitive?

42:10.100 --> 42:11.559
Very neat.

42:11.643 --> 42:15.355
-Let's sort this
out later, shall we?
-Let's not.

42:17.942 --> 42:20.987
On behalf of Mr Murdo,
I'd like to apologise.

42:22.572 --> 42:26.326
You'll all be repaid. In full.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.536
What?

42:29.539 --> 42:33.793
It's bad enough you've had me
running after you
like your mother.

42:33.877 --> 42:38.424
I knew you were trash,
but I thought at
least you played straight.

42:38.507 --> 42:44.264
All of these people will get
their money back, but what
about my reputation? Eh?

42:44.347 --> 42:47.226
What about my self-respect?

42:47.309 --> 42:49.603
How are you going to repay me?

43:04.747 --> 43:07.624
Ah, ah, ah.

43:07.708 --> 43:11.921
-My car, I believe.
-How am I going to get home?

43:12.005 --> 43:16.761
Take my van.
The rates are very reasonable.

43:16.844 --> 43:20.765
Clear out or I'll
set the dogs on you!
They may lick you to death.

43:43.166 --> 43:46.712
Hello, Archie.
We've just had a few
friends round for cards.

43:46.796 --> 43:49.799
-How's the cottage?
-Cottage?

43:49.882 --> 43:52.094
-It's a disaster zone.
-Oh.

43:52.177 --> 43:55.013
Well, I'm sure you're
starving. There's plenty of
food in the kitchen.

44:14.994 --> 44:19.959
Mrs MacDonald, Mr MacDonald,
you've a lovely house,

44:20.042 --> 44:22.212
but you should take more care
of your possessions.

44:22.295 --> 44:24.423
Yes, we will. Thank you.

44:24.506 --> 44:30.054
Kidnapped by Robert Louis
Stevenson. A rare,
illustrated first edition.

44:30.138 --> 44:34.435
-Some dunderheid
left it in the toilet.
-Ah, right. Thanks.

44:34.518 --> 44:37.896
The culprit will be
severely dealt with.

44:37.980 --> 44:40.025
Anyhow... Good night.

44:40.108 --> 44:42.193
Thank you. And good night.

45:24.284 --> 45:26.870
(SIGHING) I am so stupid.

45:26.953 --> 45:29.582
I am so, so stupid.

45:31.292 --> 45:33.211
(SOBBING) I nearly lost
everything.

45:33.294 --> 45:35.714
Only the necklace,
my darling.

45:35.798 --> 45:39.510
You still would have had me.
Not that I'd fetch as much.

45:41.221 --> 45:42.555
Oh, Hector.

46:13.007 --> 46:14.509
Anybody home?

46:22.269 --> 46:26.773
Mr MacDonald, I'm Helen Reavey
from the council
Heritage Committee.

46:26.857 --> 46:29.652
Hello. I'm sorry
about my appearance.
I've been up all night.

46:29.736 --> 46:33.866
-Oh, don't worry.
You know Katrina?
-Hi.

46:33.949 --> 46:35.784
So, this tableau...

46:35.868 --> 46:38.037
-Yeah, please. Please go in.
-Katrina?

46:38.120 --> 46:39.580
I've seen it.

46:47.423 --> 46:50.259
-Fergal came round last night.
-I know.

46:50.342 --> 46:53.221
I can't believe you made up
all those stories about us.

46:53.305 --> 46:55.891
What stories?

46:55.974 --> 46:59.562
-Maybe he got
the wrong end of the stick.
-Yeah, right.

46:59.645 --> 47:01.522
I just told him we were
friends, that's all.

47:01.606 --> 47:04.234
Well, then you
lied 'cause we're not.

47:04.318 --> 47:06.487
Well,
what did you want me to say?

47:06.570 --> 47:11.576
I think I've seen enough.
Frankly,
Mr MacDonald, I'm surprised.

47:11.659 --> 47:15.330
I was expecting a tableau
of life in a stately home.

47:15.413 --> 47:18.292
-Yeah, I'm sorry.
We had a bit of...
-But this...

47:18.376 --> 47:23.340
This has real texture,
real atmosphere.

47:23.423 --> 47:26.301
-I mean, you can smell it.
-It does stink a bit.

47:26.385 --> 47:32.392
Oh, no. It just makes
the whole thing so intense.

47:32.475 --> 47:35.813
If it was up to me, I'd
authorise a grant right now.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.732
Oh, that's great!

47:38.816 --> 47:40.610
What do you mean,
if it was up to you?

47:40.693 --> 47:44.364
Katrina's the other
delegate so it's her call.

47:44.447 --> 47:46.325
So, what do you think?

47:47.868 --> 47:49.537
What do I think?

47:51.247 --> 47:53.917
I think it's not just clever,
it's cunning.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.962
It'd fool anyone.
It certainly fooled me.

47:59.674 --> 48:04.054
There you go, Mr MacDonald.
That's what you
wanted to hear, isn't it?

48:07.975 --> 48:11.855
So if I put Â£5 to win
on Lucky
Straight in the 2:15...

48:11.938 --> 48:15.400
And roll your winnings over
to Dozy Bumpkin in the 3:30...

48:15.483 --> 48:19.321
And it wins,
I could clear Â£5,000.
That's marvellous!

48:19.405 --> 48:22.659
-What are you two cooking up?
-Just a harmless flutter
with my bookie, darling.

48:22.743 --> 48:23.994
May I?

48:26.329 --> 48:29.876
I think we've had enough
harmless flutters for
the time being, don't you?

48:29.959 --> 48:32.587
These reformed gamblers,
they're so puritanical.

48:32.670 --> 48:35.382
It's not as if
I've got any money
to put on a blasted horse.

48:35.466 --> 48:38.427
-Excuse me.
-Oh, Katrina, hello.

48:38.510 --> 48:40.388
-Can I give you this?
-What is it?

48:40.472 --> 48:43.433
A grant cheque from
the Heritage Committee.

48:46.395 --> 48:50.149
-Don't you want to
give it to Archie?
-Sorry, I have to run.

48:50.232 --> 48:51.943
Thanks very much.

49:05.793 --> 49:09.505
Let her go, Arch.
There's plenty more
fish on the beach.

49:33.366 --> 49:36.370
Talk to me. Just one minute.

50:03.025 --> 50:04.820
Like I said, son...

50:09.366 --> 50:10.535
you lose.
