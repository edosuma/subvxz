01:37:33.806 --> 01:37:35.098
Come on.

01:37:35.182 --> 01:37:36.891
(SOBBING)

01:37:38.602 --> 01:37:39.602
Look,

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:41.104
no one's gonna
blame you.

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:42.939
Save yourself,
Carolyn.

01:37:46.318 --> 01:37:50.196
Come on.

01:37:52.992 --> 01:37:56.035
That's it.
That's it.

01:37:58.038 --> 01:37:59.414
Good girl.

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:02.709
(CREATURE WAILING)

01:38:14.930 --> 01:38:16.347
(SCREAMING)

01:38:19.226 --> 01:38:20.935
You listen to me!

01:38:21.353 --> 01:38:23.771
I am the captain
of this ship

01:38:24.064 --> 01:38:27.317
and I am not leaving
anyone on this rock with
those fucking things,

01:38:27.401 --> 01:38:28.818
even if it means...

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:30.153
(FRY GRUNTING)

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.365
Get that thing
off my neck.

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:35.533
Shut up!

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:38.578
You'd die for them?

01:38:38.662 --> 01:38:40.121
I would try for them.

01:38:41.415 --> 01:38:43.333
You didn't answer me.

01:38:43.834 --> 01:38:45.752
Yes, I would, Riddick.

01:38:46.587 --> 01:38:47.879
I would.

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.964
I would die for them.

01:38:56.221 --> 01:38:57.847
How interesting.

01:38:59.058 --> 01:39:00.433
(THUDDING)

01:39:18.243 --> 01:39:19.953
Never had a doubt.

01:39:20.913 --> 01:39:22.789
Anyone not
ready for this?

01:39:22.873 --> 01:39:24.916
There is my God,
Mr. Riddick.

01:39:43.894 --> 01:39:45.770
(CREATURES SQUEALING)

(CREATURES SCREECHING)

01:40:16.552 --> 01:40:19.053
RIDDICK: Don't stop.
Don't stop!

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:21.848
Come on! Move!

01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.726
You know the way!

01:40:37.072 --> 01:40:38.364
(SQUEALING)

01:40:45.914 --> 01:40:48.666
On board!
Come on! Get on!

01:40:55.132 --> 01:41:35.213
(SQUEALING)

01:41:44.723 --> 01:41:46.015
Carolyn.

01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:52.939
Come.

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:56.734
Now.

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.326
(RIDDICK YELLING)

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:06.828
Wait.

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:21.926
Riddick?

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:25.638
(GASPING)

01:42:29.351 --> 01:42:30.810
(PANTING)

01:42:35.232 --> 01:42:38.484
Okay, hold onto me.
Hold onto me.

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:41.571
We're gonna
get out of here.
I got you. Come on.

01:42:42.406 --> 01:42:45.992
Come on, Riddick!
Get up!

01:42:46.451 --> 01:42:47.785
Get up!

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.250
I said I'd die
for them, not you.
Let's move. Come on.

01:42:58.922 --> 01:42:59.922
(GASPING)

01:43:31.496 --> 01:43:32.914
Not for me.

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:36.292
Not for me!

01:43:47.721 --> 01:43:50.223
With so much prayer
to make up for,

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:52.558
I scarcely know
where to begin.

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:56.229
I know where
I'd start.

01:44:22.714 --> 01:44:24.257
What are you doing?

01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:40.481
(CLANGING)

01:44:50.492 --> 01:44:53.327
Can we just get
the hell out of
here now?

01:44:53.537 --> 01:44:54.996
We can't leave

(GASPING)

01:44:59.543 --> 01:45:01.335
without saying good night.

(CREATURES SCREECHING)

01:45:32.909 --> 01:45:35.911
A lot of questions,
whoever we run into.

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:38.331
Could even be
a merc ship.

01:45:40.667 --> 01:45:43.586
So, what the hell
do we tell them
about you?

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:46.088
Tell 'em Riddick's dead.

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:52.762
He died somewhere
on that planet.
