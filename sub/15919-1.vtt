07:50.667 --> 07:52.125
But you're sitting here.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.667
- (Paul Jr.)
- Wow.

07:53.792 --> 07:54.875
Yeah.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.583
You sling your penis

07:56.584 --> 07:58.083
to every MILF

07:58.208 --> 07:59.855
in Virginia-Highland

07:59.856 --> 08:01.500
to push off a dime bag.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.959
Mary Jane, come on.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.333
- (Paul Jr.)
- Wow.

08:04.458 --> 08:05.563
You whack off

08:05.564 --> 08:06.667
in your parents' house.

08:06.792 --> 08:08.291
I'ma let you have that one,

08:08.417 --> 08:10.291
- 'cause you're in front of your
- peoples, but you might...

08:10.417 --> 08:11.667
- You're gonna
- let me have it

08:11.792 --> 08:12.959
- 'Cause I'm in front
- of my peoples?

08:13.083 --> 08:14.083
- How about you're gonna
- let me have it

08:14.208 --> 08:15.272
'Cause I'm in

08:15.273 --> 08:16.333
my own damn house?

08:16.458 --> 08:18.083
- Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh...
- Oh, wow.

08:18.166 --> 08:19.250
- Wow.
- Now I see why David...

08:19.375 --> 08:20.458
Yeah.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.417
Doesn't want you.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.417
- Now I see why he's
- with that white chick.

08:24.542 --> 08:25.417
[man whistles]

08:25.542 --> 08:26.542
- (man)
- Okay.

08:27.917 --> 08:28.918
[man clears throat]

08:35.250 --> 08:36.667
- Uh...
- [laughs]

08:36.792 --> 08:41.082
You know, I... I watch those

08:41.125 --> 08:42.438
Animal Planet shows

08:42.440 --> 08:43.750
with my kids,

08:43.875 --> 08:45.918
and this particular episode,

08:45.919 --> 08:47.959
this mandarin duck

08:48.083 --> 08:49.083
was encouraging

08:49.084 --> 08:50.084
her seven ducklings...

08:50.125 --> 08:51.125
and I mean,

08:51.126 --> 08:52.126
like, new-newly born...

08:52.250 --> 08:53.918
within 24 hours,

08:53.919 --> 08:55.583
to leap out of...

08:55.709 --> 08:57.917
uh, their... their nest,

08:58.083 --> 08:59.813
and all of them

08:59.814 --> 09:01.542
land safely, except for one,

09:01.667 --> 09:03.208
and now I'm curious.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.875
What is the mother gonna do?

09:05.083 --> 09:07.166
- So she stares at the hurt
- duckling for, like, a minute,

09:07.291 --> 09:09.583
- And then she turns around,
- and she heads towards the water,

09:09.709 --> 09:11.125
- And the other ducklings
- just follow her.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.730
They don't even,

09:12.731 --> 09:14.208
like, take a second look.

09:14.333 --> 09:16.083
And then the kids start crying,

09:16.166 --> 09:18.022
and I tried to explain to them

09:18.023 --> 09:19.875
that it's just nature.

09:20.083 --> 09:21.542
- You know, in order
- for the six ducklings

09:21.667 --> 09:23.083
To have a chance at life,

09:23.166 --> 09:24.397
the mother can't go back

09:24.398 --> 09:25.625
to help just the one.

09:25.750 --> 09:29.458
It's... it's survival.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.083
- That's deep.
- Pretty good, right?

09:33.166 --> 09:36.083
[indistinct chatter]

09:36.166 --> 09:38.355
Val, did you just

09:38.356 --> 09:40.542
compare my brothers

09:40.667 --> 09:42.083
to some damn ducks?

09:43.750 --> 09:44.751
No, I was trying

09:44.752 --> 09:45.752
to give you a story...

09:45.875 --> 09:47.583
- Of all the things
- to reference,

09:47.709 --> 09:48.751
Why not choose something

09:48.752 --> 09:49.792
from the book?

09:49.917 --> 09:51.001
You know, like

09:51.002 --> 09:52.083
the reason we're here.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.375
- Well, when you're invited
- to the party two days before,

09:54.500 --> 09:56.458
- It doesn't really give you
- a chance to read the book.

09:56.583 --> 09:57.959
It's 100 pages.

09:58.083 --> 09:59.583
- You could have read it
- on the toilet.

09:59.709 --> 10:00.959
Well, I don't have the leisure

10:01.083 --> 10:02.083
of sitting around

10:02.084 --> 10:03.084
on a toilet to read.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.750
Okay.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.041
- (woman) - Why don't we
- Just move on?

10:07.166 --> 10:08.333
[all talking at once]

10:08.458 --> 10:09.875
- Somebody take the drink away.
- For real.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.375
- I didn't even know
- she was drunk.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.959
- She's drunk, all right.
- I'm sorry, no.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.458
Let's be honest.

10:14.583 --> 10:16.252
You don't have time

10:16.253 --> 10:17.917
to use the bathroom.

10:18.041 --> 10:19.292
Do you realize

10:19.293 --> 10:20.542
that every opinion

10:20.667 --> 10:21.750
that you have,

10:21.875 --> 10:23.147
every story

10:23.148 --> 10:24.417
that you tell,

10:24.542 --> 10:26.125
- every quip you
- throw out there

10:26.250 --> 10:27.564
Is based on you being

10:27.565 --> 10:28.875
a wife and a mother?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
Well, perhaps

10:30.001 --> 10:31.001
that's my context.

10:32.291 --> 10:33.583
Okay.

10:33.709 --> 10:35.208
- You know, what do you even
- have us here for?

10:35.333 --> 10:36.584
Huh, Mary Jane?

10:36.585 --> 10:37.834
So that you can insult me?

10:37.959 --> 10:39.125
I'll tell you, Val,

10:39.250 --> 10:40.333
because I wanted to know

10:40.458 --> 10:41.875
- what the hell
- was going on with David,

10:42.000 --> 10:43.459
- But since I'm done
- with his ass,

10:43.583 --> 10:45.250
- And really, you guys
- are his friends,

10:45.291 --> 10:46.500
- I should be done
- with your ass as well.

10:46.625 --> 10:48.250
- (Kara)
- MJ...

10:48.375 --> 10:50.208
- And honestly, honey,
- I'm surprised you're even out

10:50.333 --> 10:52.250
- Because Chris never
- lets you go anywhere.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.750
- Mary Jane!
- What?

10:53.875 --> 10:55.438
We can talk about my brother

10:55.439 --> 10:57.000
being a security guard.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.750
- We can have
- laughs at that,

10:58.875 --> 11:01.083
- But we can't talk about Chris
- putting her on a leash?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.959
You are so sad.

11:04.083 --> 11:04.959
[retching]

11:05.083 --> 11:05.959
Oh, goodness.

11:06.083 --> 11:07.917
- All right,
- baby girl.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.834
That's it.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.208
- Drink that
- Pedialyte.

11:11.333 --> 11:12.667
- I left it
- by your bed, okay?

11:12.792 --> 11:13.792
I will.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.418
Sleep in tomorrow,

11:17.419 --> 11:18.458
all right?

11:18.583 --> 11:20.500
- Monday's
- 30 hours away.

11:20.625 --> 11:22.083
I will.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.291
[sighs]

11:23.417 --> 11:24.959
And hey...

11:25.083 --> 11:27.834
don't beat yourself up.

11:27.959 --> 11:29.021
You are allowed

11:29.022 --> 11:30.083
to take twice as long

11:30.125 --> 11:32.168
untangling your heart from him

11:32.169 --> 11:34.208
as you spent loving him.

11:34.333 --> 11:35.750
It's the Grand Canyon theory.

11:35.875 --> 11:37.291
I need to lay down,

11:37.417 --> 11:38.834
- and I need you
- to stop talking,

11:38.875 --> 11:40.084
- And I need you
- to go home.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.792

White boys.

13:43.458 --> 13:44.875
Ooh.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.292
We should get

13:46.293 --> 13:47.500
Sheldon Dewitt on.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.083
- He hasn't given
- an interview to anybody,

13:49.208 --> 13:50.083
Not print or otherwise.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.417
- He's retired.
- So?

13:51.542 --> 13:53.042
- These guys are still
- in the game.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.147
We need to tap

13:54.148 --> 13:55.208
into the tech world more.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.625
Up our male viewers.

13:56.750 --> 13:57.625
That's what we got to do.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.542
Males.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.125
Uh-oh. What'd I say?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.750
- I just don't feel like
- I know everything.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.043
Kara, there... he couldn't

14:05.044 --> 14:07.208
possibly want her like that.

14:07.333 --> 14:08.834
- Oh, my God.
- We're talking about David?

14:08.959 --> 14:10.834
- I just feel like
- I need closure.

14:10.959 --> 14:12.751
Like, if I knew why,

14:12.752 --> 14:14.542
then I could let him go.

14:14.667 --> 14:15.959
He's with somebody else, Mama.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.250
That's why.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.208
- When he came over that night,
- he didn't want to leave.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.291
- He wanted
- to stay, Kara.

14:20.417 --> 14:21.583
Okay.

14:21.709 --> 14:23.750
I think he wants me back,

14:23.875 --> 14:26.083
but I just pushed him too far.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.583
I can't.

14:27.709 --> 14:29.291
- And, you know, you could go
- down this road with me

14:29.417 --> 14:30.625
- Just a little bit.
- You know what?

14:30.750 --> 14:32.083
I've been down that road,

14:32.166 --> 14:33.417
- and I'm just trying
- to save you the trouble.

14:33.542 --> 14:34.834
Mm-hmm.

14:34.959 --> 14:35.875
- Do you still think
- about John?

14:36.083 --> 14:36.917
[scoffs]

14:37.083 --> 14:38.125
Not much anymore.

14:38.250 --> 14:39.875
- Not even
- on the horny days?

14:40.083 --> 14:41.209
No, because a good friend

14:41.210 --> 14:42.333
of mine told me

14:42.458 --> 14:43.855
that dipping into archival penis

14:43.856 --> 14:45.250
can be tricky on the heart.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.083
- I said that?
- Yeah. You did.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.583
- And don't go there again,
- so come back to me.

14:50.709 --> 14:51.875
We got work to do, okay?

14:52.083 --> 14:53.750

14:53.875 --> 14:55.959
- (woman)
- Coming up on Rehab Addict...

14:56.083 --> 14:57.334
This house

14:57.335 --> 14:58.583
is so busted.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.542
[both laughing]

15:02.542 --> 15:04.208
Oh, hey, Grandma.

15:04.333 --> 15:05.458
- Did you need
- something?

15:05.583 --> 15:06.875
Who are you,

15:07.083 --> 15:08.959
- and why are you
- in my house unannounced?

15:10.208 --> 15:11.418
Grandma,

15:11.419 --> 15:12.625
this is Shelley.

15:12.750 --> 15:13.875
- Treyvion's
- godmother.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.083
[laughs]

15:15.125 --> 15:16.083
Well, you're never around.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.083
Forgot what you look like.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.313
But you still

15:19.314 --> 15:20.500
have to be announced

15:20.625 --> 15:22.273
so that she can learn

15:22.274 --> 15:23.917
some manners and ask,

15:24.083 --> 15:25.875
instead of assuming

15:26.083 --> 15:27.522
you can do whatever

15:27.523 --> 15:28.959
you want in my house.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.334
Why you always trying

15:30.335 --> 15:31.583
to embarrass me?

15:31.709 --> 15:33.083
I don't have to do that.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.501
You do a great job yourself,

15:35.502 --> 15:37.792
and it's "why are you."

15:37.917 --> 15:40.125
Use a verb sometime.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.667
Girl, just go.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.521
Why are you

Hey.

Hey.

- I didn't think

34:23.375 --> 34:25.083
Neither did I.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.542

- I didn't really plan

34:32.667 --> 34:34.833
Beyond this moment.

34:38.583 --> 34:39.875
Yeah, me neither.

34:47.708 --> 34:49.083
Why did you come?

34:51.083 --> 34:52.333
Why'd you want me here?

34:52.458 --> 34:53.583
For a rising star,

34:53.585 --> 34:54.708
you're not that bright.

34:58.125 --> 34:59.542
- Are you with her
- because you love her,

34:59.667 --> 35:01.417
Or are you with her

35:01.542 --> 35:03.417
- because she's
- having your baby?

35:05.500 --> 35:06.500
I thought we were over.

35:06.542 --> 35:07.667
You made it clear

35:07.668 --> 35:08.792
that we are.

35:08.917 --> 35:11.333
[sighs]

35:11.458 --> 35:13.750

35:15.083 --> 35:16.959
- You had me thinking
- it was me.

35:17.083 --> 35:18.355
You were fine

35:18.356 --> 35:19.625
with letting me think

35:19.750 --> 35:21.417
that the reason we didn't

35:21.418 --> 35:23.083
work out was my fault.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.355
Us not working out

35:24.356 --> 35:25.500
has nothing to do with her.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.792
No, no, no, no.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.209
My question is,

35:29.210 --> 35:30.500
why was it okay?

35:32.458 --> 35:33.709
I was angry with you.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.375
- You nearly killed me
- when you told me

35:35.500 --> 35:37.668
That you were having her

35:37.669 --> 35:39.834
move in with you.

35:39.959 --> 35:42.126
Why not just throw in

35:42.127 --> 35:44.291
the baby news then?

35:46.625 --> 35:49.458
I wanted to be sure.

35:49.583 --> 35:51.166
I mean, we don't...

35:51.291 --> 35:53.291
- we don't even have
- the appointment until next week.

35:53.417 --> 35:54.480
Is that why you wanted me

35:54.481 --> 35:55.542
to pee on a stick?

35:57.667 --> 35:59.084
- You didn't want
- two baby mamas?

36:00.417 --> 36:02.083
Okay, having a baby with her?

36:02.166 --> 36:03.417
Cool.

36:03.542 --> 36:05.083
Having a baby by me?

36:05.125 --> 36:06.918
Well that's just...

36:06.919 --> 36:08.709
that's frightening.

36:08.834 --> 36:09.897
I knew this

36:09.898 --> 36:10.959
was a bad idea.

36:11.083 --> 36:12.313
Did you tell her

36:12.314 --> 36:13.542
to have an abortion too?

36:16.083 --> 36:17.126
Did you... did you

36:17.127 --> 36:18.166
do that to her?

36:18.291 --> 36:19.917
I didn't tell her,

36:19.918 --> 36:21.542
just like I didn't tell you.

36:21.667 --> 36:22.875
You didn't tell me

36:22.876 --> 36:24.083
not to, either.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.542
Yeah.

36:30.667 --> 36:33.917
No. I didn't.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.250
I want this baby.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.875
Do you want her?

36:45.417 --> 36:46.750
This child is going

36:46.751 --> 36:48.083
to be raised by two parents,

36:48.125 --> 36:49.230
and I'm not talking

36:49.231 --> 36:50.333
about that weekend crap.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.083
- Mary Jane,
- we did the right thing

36:53.166 --> 36:54.709
For our circumstances.

36:54.834 --> 36:56.208
- I mean, we didn't know
- what we were doing.

36:56.333 --> 36:57.834
Where we were at.

36:57.959 --> 36:59.542
- You had just got
- the job at CNN.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.542
And I quickly lost it.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.333
- I had just sold
- everything.

37:03.458 --> 37:05.355
Our lives were not

37:05.356 --> 37:07.250
set up for a child.

37:07.375 --> 37:09.208
Period.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.917
Look at us now.

37:13.333 --> 37:16.333
I made that choice

37:16.458 --> 37:18.689
because I wanted to have kids

37:18.690 --> 37:20.917
under the right circumstances,

37:21.083 --> 37:22.855
not eliminate the option

37:22.856 --> 37:24.625
altogether.

Mary Jane, you're not
