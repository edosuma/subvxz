00:23.991 --> 00:26.733
Get Airwolf out of the area
and back to its hiding place.

00:30.898 --> 00:32.343
I wanna beat you even odds.

00:32.399 --> 00:35.403
Airwolf versus Airwolf, full on dogfight.

00:35.636 --> 00:38.242
You're like a couple of gunfighters
heading for a showdown.

00:38.305 --> 00:40.046
Aren't you curious to know who's best?

00:40.107 --> 00:42.883
I hope you fly him into the ground.

00:46.413 --> 00:47.414
Turbos.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.461
You can't! We're gonna pile into those walls!

01:59.052 --> 02:02.158
This briefing is from file A56-7W.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.394
Classified: Top Secret

02:03.457 --> 02:04.902
Subject: Airwolf

02:04.958 --> 02:06.699
A Mach 1-plus attack helicopter

02:06.760 --> 02:09.205
with the most advanced weapon
system in the air today.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.902
It's been hidden somewhere
in the western United States

02:11.965 --> 02:13.638
by its test pilot, Stringfellow Hawke.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.338
Hawke has promised to return Airwolf

02:15.402 --> 02:18.975
only if we can find his brother
Sin Jin, an MIA in Vietnam.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.780
We suspect Archangel, Deputy Director

02:20.841 --> 02:22.514
of the agency that built Airwolf

02:22.576 --> 02:23.953
is secretly helping Hawke

02:24.011 --> 02:25.684
in return for Hawke's flying Airwolf

02:25.746 --> 02:27.384
on missions of national concern.

02:27.447 --> 02:30.587
Stringfellow Hawke is 34,
a brilliant combat pilot

02:30.651 --> 02:32.927
and a recluse since his
brother's disappearance.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.795
His only friend is Dominic Santini

02:34.855 --> 02:37.392
whose air service is the cover
for their government work.

02:37.457 --> 02:39.300
With Hawke and Santini flying as a team,

02:39.359 --> 02:40.997
at speeds rivaling the fastest jets,

02:41.061 --> 02:42.563
backed by unmatched firepower,

02:42.629 --> 02:45.337
Airwolf is too dangerous to be
left in unenlightened hands.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.470
Finding it is your 1st priority.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.284
Dom, we got any signal yet?

03:01.348 --> 03:04.488
They can't bend radar around corners, String.

03:07.387 --> 03:10.300
Hang on. We'll climb up where they can see us.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.139
There it is. Bearing 295,

03:20.233 --> 03:22.235
in that itty-bitty canyon, I'll bet.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.679
Weapons to combat mode.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.011
Combat mode.

03:38.151 --> 03:39.391
Turbos.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.023
String, that canyon ain't wide enough

03:41.088 --> 03:43.227
for a couple of burros to walk side by side.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.930
We'll make it if we get those
burros out of our way.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.863
String, you hit the bull's-eye.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.199
All right, let's climb out of it.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.035
Dom, she's still awful mushy.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.871
Canyon walls coming up.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.878
This thing's lost all of its delicacy.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.280
I got to muscle it.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.876
You can't! We're gonna pile into those walls!

04:34.941 --> 04:36.887
Can't help it. We gotta try.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.439
Oh, my God!

05:18.485 --> 05:20.431
Saint Peter, I presume.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.868
Sorry, just your run-of-the-mill Archangel.

05:30.530 --> 05:35.138
Great jumping Jehoshaphat!

05:35.502 --> 05:37.345
Well, what's your appraisal, Mr. Santini?

05:37.404 --> 05:38.576
Are you kiddin'?

05:38.638 --> 05:40.675
Man, that's amazing.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.617
I forgot it was a game.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.555
It's not a game, it's a simulation.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.256
But we're pleased you find it so realistic.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.888
Yeah, you just sit in there and
you… you swear it's the real thing.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.590
Well, not quite.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.900
The stick's way too loose.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.801
And there's too much yaw.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.531
The real Airwolf would have made it.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.800
Well, maybe next time, when
you're more familiar with…

06:01.862 --> 06:03.967
There won't be a next time.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.874
I came and I flew this overgrown video machine

06:06.933 --> 06:08.139
like you asked.

06:08.468 --> 06:09.845
I told you what's wrong with it.

06:09.903 --> 06:11.246
Now I'm goin' home.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.976
Simulation is now complete.
All banks show recycle mode.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.751
I'll be outside when you're ready
to fly us back to the cabin.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.759
Hawke, Dr. Winchester has a report

06:21.815 --> 06:23.226
he'd like you to fill out.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.523
I forgot my pen.

06:28.521 --> 06:31.092
Well, I'd sure like to know how you do it.

06:31.258 --> 06:32.464
Well, come with me.

06:32.525 --> 06:33.868
All right.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.805
His reaction was unexpected
and totally uncalled for.

06:39.866 --> 06:41.937
He claims it didn't fly like Airwolf.

06:42.002 --> 06:44.346
Well, I'm not saying it's perfect, Archangel.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.077
It's only Phase I.

06:46.139 --> 06:48.585
Phase II requires Airwolf and Hawke.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.613
You must deliver him.

06:51.144 --> 06:52.452
I agree.

06:52.512 --> 06:55.356
The simulation is controlled
from the main terminal

06:55.415 --> 06:57.622
and several smaller terminals.

06:57.817 --> 06:59.592
We installed this large screen

06:59.653 --> 07:02.065
so visitors could view the action more easily.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.500
You could see what was happenin' in there?

07:05.558 --> 07:09.370
Yes, and I must confess
that when Airwolf crashed,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.674
I felt a little shiver.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.146
I didn't know you cared.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.442
We know what Airwolf looks like, of course.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.950
And we have a pretty clear
idea of its capabilities,

07:20.006 --> 07:21.781
even the classified ones.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.787
It's just a matter of putting performance

07:23.843 --> 07:25.186
and appearance together

07:25.245 --> 07:27.191
in a given scenario at computer speed.

07:27.247 --> 07:30.319
The graphics computers we’re
making even 3 years ago

07:30.383 --> 07:32.488
were cave drawings compared to these.

07:32.552 --> 07:34.327
What about other aircraft?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.060
We have quite a library.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.660
How about our Hughes 500

07:43.897 --> 07:45.308
meeting its fate?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.603
Very impressive.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.544
Well worth the Firm's investment.

07:50.603 --> 07:51.673
Thank you.

07:51.738 --> 07:54.241
I want to tell you, you put some
g-forces in that simulator,

07:54.307 --> 07:57.083
and nobody will be able
to tell the difference.

07:57.777 --> 08:01.122
I could. Flying is flying and games are games.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.094
That's not very helpful.

08:08.588 --> 08:12.365
Could you put a percentage on how
realistic you thought it was?

08:13.026 --> 08:14.835
It's not exactly a perfect 10.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.673
Dr. Winchester would be
the first to admit that.

08:17.731 --> 08:20.337
That's exactly why he
needs your participation.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.244
That's another thing, how come
Robert Winchester's in this program?

08:23.303 --> 08:25.544
He's a pilot, not a scientist.

08:25.905 --> 08:27.851
It is possible to be both.

08:29.609 --> 08:33.557
Well, Winchester was one of the
original bunch of Airwolf pilots.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.421
Back when you were gonna make a fleet.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.929
His computer skills made him
more valuable on the ground.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.962
Well, I heard he washed out.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.299
He's great on instruments
but had no natural ability.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.563
Now he's supposed to teach me to fly Airwolf?

08:48.628 --> 08:50.665
But that's not what they're sayin', String.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.937
No one can fly Airwolf the way you do.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.137
And that's the problem.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.373
We have no backup, and no way to train them.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.349
What happens if you go for a hike
one day and don't come back?

08:59.406 --> 09:00.817
What happens 10 years from now,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.184
when your flying skills begin to erode?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.252
With Winchester's equipment, we can get

09:05.311 --> 09:07.985
a computer-perfect profile
not only of Airwolf,

09:08.048 --> 09:11.621
but of how Stringfellow Hawke,
in his prime, flies Airwolf.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.391
Some of the major-league baseball teams

09:13.453 --> 09:16.161
are using similar techniques
to profile the perfect swing.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.328
I read about that. Pete
Rose will live forever.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.000
I'm not gonna take Airwolf anyplace

09:22.062 --> 09:24.133
the Firm can get its hands on her.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.505
Each night you can fly it away

09:26.566 --> 09:28.637
to any hiding place you choose.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.214
Yeah, I'll think about it.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.520
No matter how many times I see it,

10:11.744 --> 10:13.917
she still takes my breath away.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.256
Yeah.

10:23.356 --> 10:24.733
How much food we got?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.771
About 5 days' worth.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.136
Hey, if we run short, we can always set down

10:29.195 --> 10:31.732
in the parking lot of the
local market, you know.

10:33.733 --> 10:36.373
You're lookin' forward to this, aren't you?

10:36.436 --> 10:38.040
Well, yes I am.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.314
If we can help the next generation, why not?

10:42.008 --> 10:44.682
You're tellin' me you're doin'
this for the next generation?

10:44.744 --> 10:46.985
Hey, when you get to be my age, sonny,

10:47.046 --> 10:49.754
you'll see that it's important
to leave somethin' behind.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.592
Yeah, you and Pete Rose,
you're gonna live forever.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.223
Come on, nobody lives forever.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.995
No, it's… it's just that

10:58.892 --> 11:01.338
I… I just love the idea, that's all.

11:01.794 --> 11:03.603
Hey, 20 or 30 years from now,

11:03.663 --> 11:05.836
when you're sittin' on
that cabin porch of yours,

11:05.899 --> 11:07.879
and I'm flying charter for you-know-who,

11:09.035 --> 11:11.606
Some pilot will be sittin' in that simulator.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.710
They'll be flyin' combat against you and me.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.350
We'll be kickin' their butts.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.319
Hey, they'll be chasin'
our smoke all over the sky

11:22.448 --> 11:24.018
And they'll be sayin', “Who the hell”

11:24.083 --> 11:26.324
“are these guys Hawke and Santini?”

11:26.386 --> 11:28.889
If I don't stuff this big
bird in the ground first.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.401
Oh, come on, don't worry about that.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.528
It was just a fluke.

11:35.261 --> 11:37.036
I guess every pilot goes through it.

11:37.096 --> 11:38.666
Seems like when you hit the backside,

11:38.731 --> 11:40.677
you start to lose your reflexes.

11:40.733 --> 11:41.734
Yeah.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.710
Maybe this thing came along
at just the right time.

11:48.107 --> 11:50.451
Yeah, but listen, you
ain't on your backside yet,

11:50.510 --> 11:51.818
not by a long shot.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.449
Now, come on, give me a hand with
the rest of these groceries.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.388
Target is destroyed.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.430
You have 30 seconds to get out of the canyon.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.029
25 seconds…

12:05.892 --> 12:07.462
20 seconds…

12:10.563 --> 12:12.133
15 seconds…

12:15.435 --> 12:16.812
10 seconds…

12:16.869 --> 12:20.373
9… 8… 7… 6…

12:21.040 --> 12:24.021
5… Pull up. Pull up!

12:30.450 --> 12:33.727
You did it! Hawke crashed it, but you did it!

12:37.056 --> 12:38.933
Yeah, I pulled it out.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.802
You are the best, Robert.
You are. You really are.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.749
That's it?

12:56.809 --> 12:59.756
It's not exactly downtown USA, is it?

13:23.936 --> 13:26.212
The telemetry pod will record your position,

13:26.272 --> 13:28.616
speed, and so on, anywhere on the range.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.211
I'm not going to be responsible

13:30.276 --> 13:31.880
if that thing tears off at Mach 1.

13:31.944 --> 13:33.890
It'll stay on all right.

13:33.946 --> 13:36.756
We've hooked them up to
F-15s and pushed to Mach 3.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.920
No problem.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.191
You got any F-15s out here today?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.832
No. No, not today.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.068
We have to work our way
up the ladder, you know.

13:46.125 --> 13:48.901
We have to see Airwolf
crawl before she can run.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.557
It's the 1984 model Airwolf

14:10.616 --> 14:13.290
taking on Detroit's more
demanding torture test

14:13.353 --> 14:16.357
engineered like no other Airwolf in the world.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.129
Let's do it again.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.175
The fine movements are just as important

14:27.233 --> 14:29.577
as the high-speed ones, Mr. Hawke.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.479
Thank you for your help. You're doing fine.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.825
Very good, Airwolf.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.924
Now, let's see if you're as
good against a moving target.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.265
That's the way it is in combat, Winchester.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.668
Things move.

14:54.093 --> 14:57.074
Of course, you won't be using
live ammunition this time.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.132
The machines can tell if you hit or missed.

14:59.198 --> 15:03.772
Missed? Mister, you do got a
lot to learn about Airwolf.

15:17.950 --> 15:19.691
Chain guns. Chain guns.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.433
Well, how'd did I do?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.004
We'll tally up at the end
of the day, Mr. Hawke.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.545
Beautiful.

15:42.175 --> 15:46.055
She is, better appreciated
from a distance, Michael.

15:46.345 --> 15:48.120
I'm a man of my word.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.790
You're helping us, and I appreciate it.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.296
I've doubled security at the perimeter.

15:53.352 --> 15:56.299
You're safer sleeping here than
out in the middle of nowhere.

15:56.355 --> 16:00.030
I like nowhere, especially the middle section.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.539
An excellent day, Mr. Hawke, excellent.

16:08.334 --> 16:10.439
We have an almost perfect readout

16:10.503 --> 16:12.574
of Airwolf against ground targets.

16:12.638 --> 16:14.481
What do you mean almost perfect?

16:14.540 --> 16:16.850
Well, 100% would be perfect.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.013
You got 87%.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.249
87%?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.792
Well, you missed a couple.
Surely you know that.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.986
We didn't miss.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.552
Each pass looked right
on the money to me, Doc.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.360
You were sitting in the back, Mr. Santini.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.765
The computer had the best seat in the house.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.302
It was wrong.

16:33.226 --> 16:35.968
The machine has no reason to lie, Mr. Hawke,

16:36.329 --> 16:37.899
unlike the pilot.

16:40.032 --> 16:41.477
Come on, Dom.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.744
If I say something,

16:46.806 --> 16:48.945
you won't get teed off, will you?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.114
Sometimes, I just don't
understand you, String.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.586
And before,

16:53.913 --> 16:57.622
you used to talk about how stupid
and artificial this thing is.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.294
But when it gives you
less than a perfect score,

17:00.353 --> 17:03.527
you… you act like you lost a war or somethin'.

17:04.156 --> 17:06.602
Hey, lighten up on yourself, will you?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.599
We hit those targets 10 for 10.

17:09.662 --> 17:12.006
Yeah, sure looked that way to me, too.

17:12.064 --> 17:15.307
But so what if the computer
has a few bugs in it?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.279
Don't take it so personally.

17:17.336 --> 17:18.940
Well, Winchester sure is.

17:19.005 --> 17:20.678
He's really enjoyin' crackin' the whip

17:20.740 --> 17:23.242
and making me jump through those hoops.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.680
How well do you know that guy?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.549
I said hello to him on the flight line,

17:28.614 --> 17:30.287
across the room at parties.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.758
He was closer to Moffett than anybody.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.594
Moffett? The guy who invented Airwolf?

17:39.191 --> 17:41.535
They sort of spoke the same language.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.776
Well, it won't hurt us none

17:48.834 --> 17:51.576
to play trained pony for
a couple of more days.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.880
Yeah, I guess not.

17:57.977 --> 18:01.322
Besides, it's nice to be outside
the city for a while, huh?

18:03.516 --> 18:04.722
Listen.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.094
What kind of a lame coyote is that?

18:14.160 --> 18:16.572
Lame? I suppose you can do better.

18:22.268 --> 18:25.647
Coyote! That's the kind that
paints his own fingernails.

18:25.705 --> 18:28.015
You're calling my coyote a sissy?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.880
You're really feeling your oats tonight.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.112
Well, why not?

19:02.174 --> 19:04.245
In just a couple of days…

19:04.310 --> 19:06.347
You won't need another couple of days.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.392
Hawke's madder than sin now.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.790
Didn't you see his face?

19:09.849 --> 19:10.827
I saw it.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.420
He won't be able to resist the challenge.

19:13.486 --> 19:17.093
Another bad score and he'll
be ready for anything.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.884
What was his real score today?

19:36.942 --> 19:38.114
Perfect.

19:38.544 --> 19:41.889
It's nearly impossible to miss
a ground target from Airwolf.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.621
Yes, but air-to-air, that's
somethin' else, right?

19:44.684 --> 19:45.958
Exactly.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.392
Thanks.

19:47.586 --> 19:50.226
How they could pass up
a superb mind like yours

19:50.289 --> 19:52.929
in favor of some rudder-jockey like Hawke

19:52.992 --> 19:54.300
is beyond me.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.668
Yeah, well,

19:55.728 --> 19:57.298
that's the way it is.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.900
What a person knows,

20:00.566 --> 20:03.513
what a person can do, or make, or create,

20:04.437 --> 20:06.246
they forget all that.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.046
All goes by the board,

20:08.507 --> 20:11.113
when the kid with the
great right arm shows up.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.048
The natural talent.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.490
And Hawke was always that kid, wasn't he?

20:18.818 --> 20:21.492
I hope you fly him into the ground.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.396
You know, I never could've done any of this,

20:26.459 --> 20:28.063
if it wasn't for you.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.639
Don't be ridiculous.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.902
You designed the simulator.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.612
But without your encouragement,

20:36.669 --> 20:39.809
I never would've got this
close to taking Hawke on.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.653
I love you.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.193
I'm sorry.

20:52.351 --> 20:53.921
That's all right. It's okay.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.899
You'd better run some cold
water on that right away.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.264
Cold water?

20:58.324 --> 21:00.702
In the men's room. Go on.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.831
Okay.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.418
That was fortuitous.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.977
No, I spilled it.

21:20.546 --> 21:22.321
What is your progress?

21:22.381 --> 21:25.385
If all goes well, the machine’ll
be in your hands tomorrow.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.863
I'll contact you with the details.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.197
But Airwolf must have defenses against theft.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.203
Which I will neutralize.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.497
Once we have access to the on-board computer,

21:35.561 --> 21:37.165
there will be no problem.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.233
Your control over Winchester seems good.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.703
It is absolute.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.871
He thinks this is all designed

21:44.937 --> 21:46.280
to provide a moment of truth

21:46.338 --> 21:48.944
between him and Stringfellow Hawke.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.215
He knows nothing of the larger plan.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.824
Such a brilliant and inventive mind

21:54.880 --> 21:58.453
to be swayed by the most basic passions:

21:58.517 --> 22:00.793
jealousy and lust.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.657
The machines get smarter.

22:05.224 --> 22:06.794
Men never change.

22:13.399 --> 22:15.345
Rocket fire, rocket fire.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.278
How am I doin'?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.650
We don't analyze maneuvers
one at a time, Mr. Hawke.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.052
The next run…

22:25.110 --> 22:27.112
You tell me if that was a hit or a miss,

22:27.179 --> 22:29.557
or I'm vectoring out of here right now.

22:33.586 --> 22:34.656
You missed him.

22:34.720 --> 22:38.031
Winchester, I want to talk
to you right now. Alone.

22:41.460 --> 22:43.838
That bird was square on
line with the target box.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.933
Maybe you clutched at the last minute.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.602
I didn't clutch.

22:47.666 --> 22:50.875
Look Hawke, it's not my fault
you keep missing the targets.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.472
We recalibrated this morning.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.573
The machine is perfect.

22:53.639 --> 22:55.209
The machine is screwed up.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.480
I've had Airwolf in combat.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.317
I know her. You don't.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.515
I know her.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.818
Then why aren't you flying her

23:00.880 --> 23:02.860
instead of throwing the clay pigeons.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.826
Bureaucratic stupidity.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.893
It's too bad they didn't make 2 of them.

23:10.456 --> 23:12.163
I can simulate 2.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.401
Airwolf versus Airwolf, full on dogfight.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.505
With you pushing the buttons?

23:22.601 --> 23:23.944
No tricks.

23:24.570 --> 23:26.811
I wanna beat you even odds.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.586
Come on, String,

23:36.649 --> 23:38.856
let's forget the whole thing and go home.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.522
It's not a game anymore.

23:40.586 --> 23:42.065
You're like a couple of gunfighters

23:42.121 --> 23:43.464
heading for a showdown.

23:43.522 --> 23:45.433
Besides, I don't like anybody messin' around

23:45.491 --> 23:46.663
with these electronics.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.762
Aren't you curious to know who's best?

23:48.827 --> 23:51.774
I never lost so much as a
fingernail flyin' with you.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.867
That's good enough for me.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.044
There's the lab.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.240
How many heat sources have you got?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.612
Just 2, outside.

24:50.956 --> 24:52.299
It's here.

24:52.691 --> 24:54.432
We’re on our way.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.078
This is the prototype of the laser frame.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.517
We've kept it in storage just in case.

25:09.575 --> 25:11.452
It works just the same as the other one.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.989
How do I know that?

25:14.880 --> 25:18.885
Well, we can trade ships, if you want to.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.295
No, thanks.

25:24.289 --> 25:25.996
You can't see the lasers now,

25:26.058 --> 25:28.436
but once you get inside,
with the frosted glass,

25:28.494 --> 25:30.405
the program will appear.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.604
You see what I mean?

25:33.665 --> 25:36.009
This is exactly what I was worried about.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.639
How do we know what's happenin' in there?

25:38.704 --> 25:39.978
All done.

25:49.314 --> 25:50.793
Ready for test?

25:53.118 --> 25:55.894
Put him in the canyon, doing 100 knots.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.433
You got it.

26:29.488 --> 26:31.490
Does the feel seem okay?

26:31.557 --> 26:33.537
We don't want it mushy, do we?

26:41.033 --> 26:42.671
Set him back down.

26:42.801 --> 26:44.644
He's on the ground.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.563
Ready, Hawke?

27:06.625 --> 27:07.865
Ready.

27:09.495 --> 27:10.565
Let's go.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.733
After you.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.758
How much further?

27:36.989 --> 27:39.469
Beyond the perimeter fence, one mile.

27:41.693 --> 27:43.900
Is that the best you can do, Hawke?

28:09.288 --> 28:11.427
You can't lose me that easy, Hawke.

28:11.857 --> 28:13.996
I'm not trying to lose you.

28:14.059 --> 28:16.335
I'm just giving you a flying lesson.

29:02.975 --> 29:05.979
Alert! Alert! Security breach. Sector 11B.

29:07.579 --> 29:10.355
Alert! Alert! Security breach. Sector 11B.

29:10.882 --> 29:12.589
What is it?

29:13.151 --> 29:14.528
The perimeter alarm.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.327
Security's been breached.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.023
Get the doors open!

29:18.090 --> 29:19.899
We have to get Airwolf outta here.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.916
What's going on, Dom?

29:39.311 --> 29:41.655
I've got a firefight 2 klicks east.

29:41.980 --> 29:43.550
Let's go have a look.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.021
And a wonderful time was had by all.

30:11.243 --> 30:14.247
The funds for this project
did not include an allocation

30:14.313 --> 30:18.989
for self-indulgence,
Mr. Hawke, Dr. Winchester.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.031
This was totally uncalled
for and very nearly tragic.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.426
Fortunately, my beefed-up security

30:27.492 --> 30:30.063
prevented the evening
from ending on a sour note.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.768
Such as Airwolf in the hands of criminals.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.469
Is that what they were?

30:34.533 --> 30:38.242
I was hopeful you could tell us who they were.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.643
I don't know.

30:39.705 --> 30:40.945
Only the 4 of you

30:41.006 --> 30:43.350
knew that Airwolf would be here last night.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.920
This is a large laboratory complex.

30:45.977 --> 30:48.082
I'm sure there are other projects around here

30:48.146 --> 30:49.716
someone might like to steal.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.193
This project is officially shut down.

30:52.250 --> 30:53.228
You can't.

30:53.285 --> 30:54.389
I am.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.361
What's more, you and Miss Norris

30:56.421 --> 30:58.162
are under house arrest in this lab

30:58.223 --> 31:00.294
until I can straighten this out.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.203
You can't do that. What gives you the right?

31:03.261 --> 31:06.003
How does "national security" sound to you?

31:06.565 --> 31:08.374
What about Dom and I?

31:08.433 --> 31:10.572
I'd like nothing better than to have you both

31:10.635 --> 31:12.740
safely back wherever you hide Airwolf.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.216
Well, I never thought I'd hear you say that.

31:15.273 --> 31:17.048
However, you 2 are the only ones

31:17.109 --> 31:18.952
who got a look at the assault team.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.580
I may need you.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.384
We'll be in the neighborhood.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.685
You know,

31:54.346 --> 31:57.122
Archangel's basically a pretty fair man.

31:57.182 --> 31:59.355
When he clears you,
you'll be back in business.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.954
What makes you so sure I'm innocent?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.431
I saw you when the alarm went off.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.599
Save Airwolf. That's all you wanted to do.

32:09.661 --> 32:11.868
I'm sorry it had to end like that.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.768
It was quite a duel, wasn't it?

32:17.736 --> 32:19.409
Did you really think so?

32:21.306 --> 32:22.683
You had me.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.186
You never know.

32:25.143 --> 32:26.588
You were pretty tough.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.494
Hey, tell me the truth, Hawke.

32:31.550 --> 32:34.656
Is the simulator anything
like the real Airwolf.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.593
Pretty doggone close.

32:37.155 --> 32:38.657
After all this blows over,

32:38.723 --> 32:40.760
I'd like to come back
for another demonstration.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.703
It's a hell of a machine.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.935
And maybe afterwards,
we can take a spin in mine.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.733
That's a deal.

33:27.205 --> 33:28.275
What are you watching?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.081
I'm not watching,

33:30.141 --> 33:32.621
I'm running a blow-by-blow analysis.

33:33.144 --> 33:35.590
I still think you're as good as he is.

33:35.647 --> 33:37.217
Come on, honey,

33:37.282 --> 33:40.024
you saw that last maneuver. He got me.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.954
He's a superb pilot.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.660
The only thing he's got on you is experience.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.636
If you knew his bag of
tricks, you would've won.

33:47.726 --> 33:50.206
What am I supposed to do, read his mind?

33:50.262 --> 33:52.538
Not his mind.

33:52.597 --> 33:54.873
The mind of the machine.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.271
What do you mean?

33:56.334 --> 33:58.473
I noticed when we were
hooking up for the simulation

33:58.537 --> 34:01.177
that Airwolf has a rather extensive memory.

34:01.273 --> 34:03.082
When it goes into a combat mode,

34:03.141 --> 34:04.518
the memory clicks on.

34:05.443 --> 34:06.786
Of course.

34:07.145 --> 34:08.954
A complete record of every air combat

34:09.014 --> 34:10.186
Airwolf has ever been in,

34:10.248 --> 34:12.592
right in there, waiting to be studied.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.393
I don't think they know
it has this capability.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.864
It would be fascinating to look at it.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.199
I placed an interface in the central processor

34:20.257 --> 34:21.828
and tied it to Airwolf's SSB.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.099
You did?

34:24.029 --> 34:25.507
Let's try it.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.138
I don't know.

34:29.801 --> 34:32.782
Hawke's been having adventures
that should've been yours.

34:32.837 --> 34:35.181
Aren't you just a little curious?

34:40.645 --> 34:41.851
Move over.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.854
Look at those tanks.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.692
They look Russian to me.

35:49.948 --> 35:51.427
What's wrong?

35:52.017 --> 35:55.658
Nothing. I was just thinking
of something Dr. Moffett said.

35:56.054 --> 35:57.556
Who's Moffett?

35:58.089 --> 36:01.002
The designer of Airwolf. He's dead now.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.804
We were at a party one night,

36:05.196 --> 36:08.336
and he got this funny grin
on his face. He said:

36:08.600 --> 36:12.946
“Robert, Airwolf is very much a living thing.”

36:14.439 --> 36:16.350
“More than you can imagine.”

36:16.541 --> 36:18.077
What did he mean?

36:20.578 --> 36:22.785
I'm just beginning to understand.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.282
My God.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.864
Inside its computer,

36:33.925 --> 36:36.064
Airwolf contains its own design,

36:36.127 --> 36:38.232
just like a living creature.

36:38.296 --> 36:41.743
The complete information
as to how to recreate itself.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.878
Fantastic.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.941
We have to copy this out.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.219
I'll transfer it.

36:52.277 --> 36:53.688
Wait a minute.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.386
Maybe we shouldn't.

36:56.981 --> 36:58.517
Robert, think a minute.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.291
Deliver this to Archangel,
he'll forgive everything.

37:01.352 --> 37:03.127
And when he builds a new Airwolf,

37:03.188 --> 37:05.225
he'll need someone to fly it.

37:35.687 --> 37:39.134
Attention. Maintenance team to Building 5.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.363
Maintenance team to Building 5.

37:42.227 --> 37:44.264
Escape Plan South.

37:44.763 --> 37:48.176
Special equipment. 1600 hours. End.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.979
Yes, standard route,

37:50.034 --> 37:52.378
drop site to Mexico City and home.

37:52.971 --> 37:53.972
End.

38:06.484 --> 38:08.623
Is it ready? Will it take the tapes?

38:09.921 --> 38:11.161
Yes, sir.

38:27.739 --> 38:29.184
String,

38:30.074 --> 38:32.520
I'm dreaming sweet daydreams

38:32.577 --> 38:37.219
of cool, dry air at 30,000 feet.

38:40.218 --> 38:42.824
You know, Michael will be calling soon.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.168
Now he can hear radio waves coming in, too.

39:19.757 --> 39:20.929
Fruit juice?

39:20.992 --> 39:22.198
No, thanks.

39:24.095 --> 39:25.267
This is the life.

39:27.131 --> 39:29.338
I haven't had any luck trying to find the men

39:29.400 --> 39:31.505
who breached the perimeter the other night.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.947
Thought maybe one of these
faces would ring a bell.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.651
That's one of them there.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.983
- Sure is.
- The leader.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.647
Alexai Provoff.

39:40.712 --> 39:41.782
Russian?

39:41.846 --> 39:43.416
Just like caviar from fish.

39:43.481 --> 39:44.960
Top Soviet agent.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.826
He's the one who stole
our swing-wing technology.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.991
Ruthless. Can fly anything.

39:50.054 --> 39:53.331
Which means they were definitely
after Airwolf the other night.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.064
Which means one of our 2 friends

39:55.159 --> 39:57.196
in the lab is in league with him.

39:59.497 --> 40:02.637
I just can't believe that Robert
Winchester would turn over.

40:02.700 --> 40:04.202
We better get back there.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.839
Right. The main thing is for you

40:05.904 --> 40:08.851
to get Airwolf out of the area
and back to its hiding place.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.853
With pleasure. Come on, kid.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.283
All I'm askin' is, give him
the benefit of the doubt.

40:14.345 --> 40:16.916
Innocent until proven guilty.

40:17.348 --> 40:20.295
We try traitors the same
way we try pickpockets.

40:32.230 --> 40:35.837
Alert! Alert! Security breach. Sector 11B.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.456
Good idea, we'd better hide the tapes.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.226
No, Robert, I'm taking ‘em with me.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.231
What? Where?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.564
I want you to come, too. To my country.

40:59.824 --> 41:02.327
- With these, our engineers can…
- You...

41:03.795 --> 41:05.001
You used me!

41:10.501 --> 41:11.946
Robert, please stop!

41:17.775 --> 41:19.755
You didn't have to shoot him.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.649
Did we need him?

41:25.416 --> 41:26.451
No.

41:27.018 --> 41:30.363
It's not like you to be sentimental, Gloriana.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.435
Shall we go?

41:54.012 --> 41:56.014
I can take out the limo.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.324
In 20 minutes, we'll be in Mexican airspace.

41:59.784 --> 42:01.320
There is Airwolf.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.562
Don't worry about Airwolf.

42:04.622 --> 42:05.657
Agents.

42:05.723 --> 42:07.031
I know. What did they get?

42:07.091 --> 42:09.298
Designs of Airwolf.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.771
Every detail.

42:11.262 --> 42:13.674
They plan to build another one.

42:21.172 --> 42:24.153
Hawke. Hawke, do you read?

42:26.077 --> 42:27.579
Diana is the agent.

42:27.645 --> 42:29.716
She's stolen the tapes on Airwolf.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.523
Winchester's been shot. Can you help me?

42:33.117 --> 42:34.619
I'm on my way.

43:02.547 --> 43:05.357
I'm already heading south. How's Robert?

43:09.153 --> 43:11.030
Not great.

43:13.624 --> 43:15.661
Somebody's gonna pay for that.

43:31.476 --> 43:32.978
Here he comes.

43:34.846 --> 43:36.348
If you control their computer,

43:36.414 --> 43:38.416
why not just scramble their radar,

43:38.483 --> 43:39.826
and let us get away?

43:39.884 --> 43:42.728
Because if we destroy him,
ours will be the only Airwolf.

43:48.092 --> 43:51.164
He's slowing down. Here he comes.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.409
Airwolf to unidentified helicopter.

43:58.469 --> 44:00.642
You are ordered to land.

44:10.448 --> 44:11.756
Where'd he go?

44:25.163 --> 44:26.904
He's staying right with us!

44:26.964 --> 44:28.910
He must have that chopper souped-up.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.570
You want turbos?

44:30.635 --> 44:32.979
No, let's see how hot a pilot he is.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.548
We'll play this one out even.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.895
don't believe this guy.

44:49.420 --> 44:52.026
It's like trying to run from your own shadow.

44:54.992 --> 44:57.063
The instant he moves his controls,

44:57.128 --> 44:59.130
his computer tells ours, and we match it.

44:59.197 --> 45:03.805
Based on his usual patterns,
he'll turn and come back

45:04.936 --> 45:05.937
here.

45:06.837 --> 45:07.907
Fire!

45:09.307 --> 45:11.048
They nearly got us with that rocket.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.917
When will we start shooting back, String?

45:16.981 --> 45:18.688
Weapons to combat mode.

45:22.587 --> 45:24.760
Negative function, combat mode.

45:24.989 --> 45:25.899
Guns?

45:25.957 --> 45:27.095
Negative.

45:27.558 --> 45:28.662
ADF rockets?

45:28.726 --> 45:29.864
They won't deploy.

45:29.927 --> 45:31.167
Then give me turbos.

45:34.599 --> 45:36.636
Somebody pulled our teeth.

45:43.941 --> 45:45.386
Another rocket.

45:46.777 --> 45:48.586
We got nothin' goin' for us, String.

45:48.646 --> 45:50.148
Can we deploy the guns manually?

45:50.214 --> 45:51.158
I can try.

45:53.384 --> 45:55.022
Look out, rocket coming in!

45:55.486 --> 45:56.794
Tell Hawke...

45:58.422 --> 46:00.231
fly cold.

46:02.994 --> 46:05.634
Airwolf, Archangel here.

46:05.896 --> 46:08.433
Dr. Winchester says fly cold.

46:08.833 --> 46:09.834
Cold?

46:09.900 --> 46:12.107
Pull the plug back there.
They're into our electronics.

46:12.169 --> 46:14.445
Everything? Every last microchip.

46:15.039 --> 46:16.916
It's Orville and Wilbur time!

47:29.880 --> 47:32.417
I've already got an ambulance chopper coming.

47:32.483 --> 47:34.895
What could be faster than Airwolf?

47:50.000 --> 47:51.502
Have I got full power?

47:51.569 --> 47:52.741
Full power.

47:53.070 --> 47:55.050
You want the turbos?

47:57.274 --> 47:59.811
don't think so. It might hurt him.

48:14.158 --> 48:17.264
You got it. All yours.

48:19.463 --> 48:20.771
I got it.

48:40.317 --> 48:41.853
I'm flying it.
