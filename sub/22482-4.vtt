WEBVTT

00:02.636 --> 00:04.772
Can I just say

00:04.805 --> 00:07.108
what a miracle
duct tape is?

00:07.141 --> 00:09.510
It is literally holding
this building together.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.481
Why do you even bother
with that toolbox?

00:13.514 --> 00:16.084
Well, 'cause I need scissors
to cut the tape.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.519
What are you doing?

00:18.552 --> 00:20.721
Filling out law school
applications.

00:20.754 --> 00:23.357
Stanford? Oh, honey.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.758
This is you thinking
you had a shot

00:24.792 --> 00:27.128
with Matt Dillon
all over again.

00:27.161 --> 00:30.531
Hey, we had some serious
eye contact at the supermarket.

00:30.564 --> 00:33.301
He was memorizing your face
for the police report.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.272
Well, I'm not actually
applying to Stanford.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.108
I just picked up the brochure

00:40.141 --> 00:42.376
to make the other applications
nervous.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.112
Well, why not send it in?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.413
Maybe they have a quota

00:45.446 --> 00:47.515
for bitter, lonely,
middle-aged alcoholics.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.084
We can hope.

00:51.619 --> 00:55.389
But meanwhile, each application
ends up costing like $200.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.858
And everyone applies to at least
three or four schools.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.361
Oh.
"Oh"?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.630
What's that supposed to mean?
I shouldn't apply to law school?

01:02.663 --> 01:04.698
I'm not gonna get anywhere,
so why even bother?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.101
All I said was, "Oh."

01:07.135 --> 01:08.536
Sometimes I forget
how much craziness

01:08.569 --> 01:10.471
you're lugging around
in that coconut.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.373
Ugh.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.741
(sighs)

01:13.774 --> 01:15.576
I'm sorry.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.810
This is stressful.

01:16.844 --> 01:20.114
Maybe I should just pick one
school and pray I get accepted.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.149
Oh, come on.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.250
This is your future.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.551
Don't cheap out.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.719
We'll just cut back
on some extravagances.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.888
What extravagances?

01:27.921 --> 01:32.193
Yesterday I had to sew a poorly
located hole in my underwear.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.694
Well...

01:33.727 --> 01:36.197
okay, how about those
fancy crackers you buy?

01:36.230 --> 01:40.268
Again, Ritz Crackers
are not fancy.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.503
You're just fooled by the name.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.373
Well, there's got
to be something.

01:45.406 --> 01:46.640
What's our biggest bill?

01:46.674 --> 01:49.377
Probably cable and Internet.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.180
We're not stealing cable?
What has happened to us?

01:52.213 --> 01:55.716
We became better people
and that's very expensive.

01:55.749 --> 01:59.387
Okay, well, let's give up cable
and Internet for a few months.

01:59.420 --> 02:00.921
Really?

02:00.954 --> 02:04.458
You'd do that for me?

02:04.492 --> 02:06.860
Thanks.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.796
Now I can apply
to all of them.

02:08.829 --> 02:09.930
Oh.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.165
Even Stanford?

02:11.199 --> 02:12.566
Ugh. I don't think so.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.169
Why set myself up
for getting my heart broken?

02:15.203 --> 02:17.238
(sighs) Well, if
you change your mind

02:17.271 --> 02:18.906
and your heart does break,

02:18.939 --> 02:21.775
duct tape.

02:21.809 --> 02:24.345
*

02:38.459 --> 02:40.261
I'm just saying,
I've now given up pot,

02:40.294 --> 02:41.795
pills, cocaine, alcohol

02:41.829 --> 02:44.265
and most illegal activities,

02:44.298 --> 02:47.768
but nothing has kicked my ass
like quitting the Internet.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.503
No Facebook. No Twitter.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.604
Ugh.

02:50.638 --> 02:53.707
My 36 followers are
probably worried sick about me.

02:53.741 --> 02:57.578
But que sera.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.347
I'm doing this
for my daughter

02:59.380 --> 03:01.449
because sobriety
has transformed me

03:01.482 --> 03:03.984
into a thoughtful, generous,
deeply empathic being.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.619
Not to mention humble.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.256
I was too humble to say it,
so thank you.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.558
Thank you all.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.828
Would anyone else
like to share?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.364
I'll go.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.865
Hi, I'm Natasha and
I'm an alcoholic.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.433
ALL:
Hi, Natasha.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.835
I got to tell you guys,
since I started

03:21.869 --> 03:25.373
taking sobriety seriously,
great things keep happening.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.707
I got a job.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.742
I got an apartment.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.611
I got my daughter back.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.680
And then last night,
I met this guy,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.882
and I told him I'm a songwriter,
and guess what.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.851
It turns out he's a big deal
in the music business

03:37.885 --> 03:38.919
and wants to help me.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.488
How unbelievable is that?

03:40.521 --> 03:43.424
Entirely unbelievable.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.326
Anyway, he says he's gonna
listen to my demo

03:45.359 --> 03:46.327
and get right back to me.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.795
She can't be this naive.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.498
And if he likes it,
he's gonna fly me down to L.A.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.999
for the weekend
to lay down some tracks.

03:52.032 --> 03:54.602
Something's gonna get laid
down, but it ain't tracks.

03:54.635 --> 03:57.471
I get it.
You're skeptical.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.974
Without Internet,
it's like

04:01.008 --> 04:03.844
I'm much more aware
of the people around me

04:03.877 --> 04:05.012
and I must say,

04:05.045 --> 04:07.348
I don't like it.

04:08.816 --> 04:12.886
On behalf of the people around
you, right back at you.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.989
I'm worried about Jill.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.591
Has anyone heard from her?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.927
I texted her to see if she was
going to the meeting today,

04:19.960 --> 04:21.329
but she said she was busy.

04:21.362 --> 04:22.396
She blew me off, too.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.597
Well, that doesn't
prove anything.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.500
Ever since Emily moved back
with Natasha,

04:26.534 --> 04:27.868
Jill hasn't been herself.

04:27.901 --> 04:31.739
Are you referring to the
800 pounds she's packed on?

04:31.772 --> 04:32.706
Don't be mean.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.743
It's not mean when I
say it behind her back.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.611
Wendy, would you rather
I say horrible things

04:37.645 --> 04:38.846
to you or behind your back?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.914
I'd rather you didn't
say anything.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.084
Come on. Pick one, stupid.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.553
Behind my back.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.621
MARJORIE:
Ladies.

04:47.655 --> 04:50.724
A friend of ours is
in a tough situation

04:50.758 --> 04:54.462
and we have to be patient,
caring and supportive.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.531
Oh, dear Lord.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.005
Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis
has entered the building.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.874
Hey, hey.
(laughs)

05:06.907 --> 05:08.409
What do you think?

05:08.442 --> 05:11.945
(all groaning nervously)

05:11.979 --> 05:13.814
Very striking.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.715
Thank you.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.050
Is this why you couldn't
make the meeting?

05:17.084 --> 05:18.819
Yeah, but it's okay.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.421
All the stuff I would've said
in the meeting,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.490
I said to my stylist.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.124
It's not the same thing.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.493
Tell me about it.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.694
Weird to talk about yourself

05:26.727 --> 05:29.630
and no one claps
when you're done.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.599
Jill, you need to keep
going to meetings.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.967
I know, but I thought
since I got sober,

05:34.001 --> 05:36.036
my life's supposed
to get bigger and bigger.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.038
Don't.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.677
(sighs)

05:43.711 --> 05:46.414
You know, I can't
remember the last time

05:46.447 --> 05:48.616
I read something
printed on paper.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.117
It's weird, right?
Yeah.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.453
I keep trying to make it bigger,
but nothing happens.

05:52.486 --> 05:55.423
Well, I'm enjoying
being unplugged.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.990
No more friends on Facebook

05:57.024 --> 05:59.493
rubbing my nose in
their fancy vacations.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.728
Oh, I know.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.929
Then you think about
driving to their house,

06:01.962 --> 06:03.897
breaking in and
stealing all their stuff.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.101
No?

06:08.135 --> 06:09.503
No.

06:09.537 --> 06:13.507
Ooh, be right back.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.709
Holy crap.

06:15.743 --> 06:19.146
She's the one who stole my iPod
when I went to Reno.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.081
Oh, hey there,
Beverly.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.417
No chitchat till my hall
light stops flickering.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.818
Consider it done.

06:24.852 --> 06:26.854
Hey, while I got you, I need
to update tenant information

06:26.887 --> 06:28.689
for the building owners.
What do you need?

06:28.722 --> 06:29.957
Oh, the usual, you know.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.692
Your mother's maiden name,
street you grew up on,

06:31.725 --> 06:33.527
name of your first pet,
stuff like that.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.962
Why would they need that?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.197
Why do they need first
and last month's rent?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.632
It's all nonsense to me.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.001
I get it.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.936
You're trying to crack
my Wi-Fi password.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.572
(laughing)

06:47.107 --> 06:49.610
Beverly, you were probably
the funniest kid

06:49.643 --> 06:52.780
in your elementary school,
which was...?

06:52.813 --> 06:55.015
Fine. You want to
play this game?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.518
My mother's maiden
name is Bautista;

06:57.551 --> 06:59.219
I grew up on Front Street,

06:59.252 --> 07:01.455
and my cat was named Rascal.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.023
You still won't
figure it out.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.858
Oh, come on.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.126
Beverly, you're acting crazy.

07:06.159 --> 07:09.797
(under breath): Bautista, Front,
Rascal, Bautista, Front, Rascal.

07:11.532 --> 07:15.769
"In closing, as the neglected
child of a transgender woman,

07:15.803 --> 07:19.206
"I think I can bring
a unique perspective

07:19.239 --> 07:21.975
to the University of Idaho."

07:22.009 --> 07:24.578
Ah, that ought to put me
on top of the pile.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.846
(knock on door)

07:25.879 --> 07:27.948
Hey, you got a minute?

07:27.981 --> 07:31.619
Not really, but we both know
you're coming in anyway.

07:31.652 --> 07:34.187
Okay. So, the guy I met,

07:34.221 --> 07:35.589
his name is Teddy Blumenthal,

07:35.623 --> 07:36.890
but everybody calls him Dr. Ted

07:36.924 --> 07:38.258
'cause he's a big deal
in the music business

07:38.291 --> 07:40.561
and he played a doctor
on a soap opera once.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.195
Anyway,

07:42.229 --> 07:44.698
he really liked my demo and
he wants to fly me down to L.A.

07:44.732 --> 07:46.900
Stop.
What?

07:46.934 --> 07:48.135
Sit.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.806
Natasha, I'm
the last person

07:52.840 --> 07:54.642
who wants to crush
anybody's dreams,

07:54.675 --> 07:59.112
but this "Dr. Ted" isn't
who you think he is.

07:59.146 --> 08:01.081
Most likely he just
wants to sleep with you.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.884
No, no, I specifically asked him
about that.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.853
He said he didn't.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.055
Yeah, they say that.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.122
Next thing you know,

08:09.156 --> 08:10.991
he's got his hand
down your pants

08:11.024 --> 08:14.528
in the bathroom
at a Chili's.

08:14.562 --> 08:16.096
Why is it so hard for you

08:16.129 --> 08:17.698
to believe that
I'm a good songwriter

08:17.731 --> 08:18.866
and this guy
just wants to help me?

08:18.899 --> 08:20.934
Because men don't
just help women.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.870
Have you never
watched Dateline?

08:22.903 --> 08:25.539
I should've known
you were gonna be like this.

08:25.573 --> 08:28.308
You don't want anybody to
succeed 'cause your life sucks.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.010
Hey.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.980
I am one step away from
getting into law school

08:33.013 --> 08:36.083
at the University of
the Yucatán Peninsula.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.885
And if you didn't want
my honest opinion,

08:37.918 --> 08:39.252
why'd you come over here?

08:39.286 --> 08:42.055
'Cause I'm terrified and I
thought my friend and sponsor

08:42.089 --> 08:43.824
might give me
a little support.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.158
And I need to borrow
a roller bag.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.260
Yeah, well, I don't
have a roller bag.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.063
Of course you don't 'cause
you ain't going nowhere.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.302
Oh, God.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.305
Why am I tormented
by these giant women?

09:04.745 --> 09:07.114
Hey, what are
we watching?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.152
Dancing with the Stars.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.587
Oh, good.

09:14.922 --> 09:18.258
Wish they could open
their curtains a little more.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.728
Who is that dancing?

09:20.761 --> 09:23.563
I think it's
Greta Van Susteren.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.000
Maybe Owen Wilson?

09:29.837 --> 09:32.072
You think I'm being
too hard on Natasha?

09:32.105 --> 09:35.042
Let me think
about it. Yes.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.010
I didn't mean
to discourage her.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.312
I just don't want her
to get hurt.
I get it.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.181
But you got to remember,

09:41.214 --> 09:43.951
pain and suffering is what
makes people interesting.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.788
(cell phone chimes)

09:47.821 --> 09:49.623
Well...

09:49.657 --> 09:50.924
Oh.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.325
Speaking of which...
What?

09:52.359 --> 09:55.195
Jill is having a meltdown
at Neiman Marcus.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.898
See? Everything about
that's interesting.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.900
I'll get the keys.

10:02.169 --> 10:05.172
Hey, what do you know?
It wasn't Greta or Owen.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.908
It was the kid from Hanson.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.344
Oh, hi.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.782
Uh, we're looking
for our friend, Jill Kendall.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.049
She shops here a lot.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.118
A lot of women shop here a lot.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.653
Big girl,
might be weeping.

10:19.687 --> 10:20.988
Room four.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.360
Jill, you in there?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.829
JILL:
Yeah.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.263
Can we come in?

10:30.297 --> 10:31.298
Okay.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.302
(crying)

10:40.307 --> 10:42.142
What's going on?

10:42.175 --> 10:44.144
I've been shopping here
for 20 years,

10:44.177 --> 10:45.713
and now nothing fits.

10:45.746 --> 10:50.117
Well, maybe you just need
a bigger size.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.120
There are no bigger sizes.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.455
Even the socks
are a little snug.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.024
(crying)

10:57.057 --> 11:00.694
Jill, there are other stores
we could take you to.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.929
Yeah, how about Target?

11:01.962 --> 11:04.164
Target?

11:04.197 --> 11:06.900
Why do you hate me?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.302
We don't hate you,
we love you.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.172
If you loved me,
you would've said something

11:12.205 --> 11:15.709
before I turned into... this.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.411
We assumed you knew.

11:18.445 --> 11:20.714
Yeah, and we thought
you were okay with it.

11:20.748 --> 11:21.882
You were always bragging about

11:21.915 --> 11:23.450
how you were picking up
all these guys.

11:23.483 --> 11:25.753
I lied.

11:25.786 --> 11:29.923
The only men in my life were
Little Caesar and Papa John.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.491
(knock on door)

11:31.524 --> 11:33.093
SALESWOMAN: Ladies,
everything okay in there?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.728
Can I get you
some champagne?

11:34.762 --> 11:37.731
We can't have any champagne
because we love our sobriety

11:37.765 --> 11:40.734
and our lives are
finally on track!

11:44.838 --> 11:46.206
Jill, honey,

11:46.239 --> 11:49.176
the program isn't just about
meetings and bad coffee.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.078
You also have to
do the work.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.346
You know, you
have to dig down,

11:53.380 --> 11:56.850
try to discover the reasons
you do what you do.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.986
I know.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.855
I just don't want to.

12:01.889 --> 12:06.326
You guys know she's got
a soft serve machine back there?

12:06.359 --> 12:08.829
Nothing like soft serve
to make you happy.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.864
Mom, please, not the time.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.499
Sorry. Want a lick?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.167
A quick one.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.538
Jill, you've got
a hole inside.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.908
You've had it
your entire life.

12:20.941 --> 12:25.178
You tried to fill it with
drugs and alcohol, sex...

12:25.212 --> 12:27.280
And an ice cream machine.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.416
What? It had to
have played a role.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.220
But there's nothing

12:33.253 --> 12:35.488
that you can buy or
eat or sleep with

12:35.522 --> 12:38.558
that's gonna fix
the real problem.

12:38.591 --> 12:43.163
Well, all I know is
I got to do something different

12:43.196 --> 12:45.565
because what I've been doing
sure ain't working.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.534
That's a good start.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.172
I think I'm gonna get me
one of those.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.875
The middle handle
makes it a swirly.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.844
I worked
at a Dairy Queen.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.814
Odd thing to be smug about.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.458
Hey.
Hey.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.526
I brought you
an apology pizza.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.396
My mom took a slice
when I wasn't looking,

13:16.429 --> 13:19.132
so I guess
two apologies.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.935
Come on in.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.605
So, how'd it go in L.A.?

13:25.638 --> 13:26.907
The truth?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.241
Bring it.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.178
It was fantastic!
You were so wrong.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.380
Really?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.983
Completely, totally,
embarrassingly wrong.

13:36.016 --> 13:40.353
Here, look, Dr. Ted
sold one of my songs.

13:40.387 --> 13:42.122
This is an advance.

13:42.155 --> 13:45.258
He told me my
prognosis was famous.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.428
This is just
for one song?

13:49.629 --> 13:51.932
And you weren't
at any point naked?

13:51.965 --> 13:54.034
Ooh, that's another thing
you were wrong about.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.502
Dr. Ted, super gay.

13:55.535 --> 13:58.338
Like, "lots of young guys
around his pool" gay.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.540
You sure he wasn't just
pretending to be gay

14:00.573 --> 14:02.209
so he could
get you into bed?

14:02.242 --> 14:03.944
Oh, that doesn't
work on me anymore.

14:06.146 --> 14:08.115
So it all worked out?

14:08.148 --> 14:10.150
It did, and Emily
loved it there.

14:10.183 --> 14:13.286
I mean, she got an epic sunburn
and looks like a Jolly Rancher,

14:13.320 --> 14:16.223
but she's excited about moving.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.291
Wait, you're moving?

14:18.325 --> 14:20.928
Yeah, we're gonna
give L.A. a try.

14:20.961 --> 14:24.431
Uh, Natasha, that...

14:24.464 --> 14:27.367
that's wonderful.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.402
Your dreams are
really coming true.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.371
Well, isn't that why
you have dreams?

14:34.007 --> 14:36.043
(sighs)
Damn it.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.010
What?

14:37.044 --> 14:40.247
Thanks to you,
I have to apply to Stanford.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.683
Stanford?

14:43.716 --> 14:46.153
That's a really hard school
to get into, isn't it?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.955
What are you saying?

14:47.988 --> 14:50.657
Well, I just don't want
your feelings to get hurt

14:50.690 --> 14:53.226
if they don't--
Oh, my God, I get it!

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
That's what you
were doing to me.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.965
You only seem like a bitch
'cause you love me.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.700
Yeah, well, that's all
I was trying to...

15:00.733 --> 15:04.671
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
My creative juices are flowing.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.507
* You only seem like
a bitch 'cause you love me *

15:07.540 --> 15:11.044
* You only seem like
a bitch 'cause you care *

15:11.078 --> 15:14.581
* You only seem like
a bitch 'cause you love me *

15:14.614 --> 15:18.018
* With your big eyes and
your stringy blonde hair. *

15:19.386 --> 15:21.989
Don't worry, that's
not about you.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.993
Ooh, I got to
write that down.

15:29.062 --> 15:32.432
(laughing)

15:33.766 --> 15:35.735
She gonna join us
at some point?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.405
Not as long as
the Wi-Fi here works.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.607
Give her a Ziploc full of
Cheerios and a juice box,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.309
she's a happy
three-year-old.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.178
Damn it.
What?

15:45.212 --> 15:48.415
Jill's Skyping during
my Game of Thrones binge.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.284
You're laughing out loud
at Game of Thrones?

15:51.318 --> 15:54.254
Yeah, reminds me of high school.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.323
Oh, good, you're all there.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.424
Where are you?

15:57.457 --> 16:00.160
I'm in a limousine just outside
of Tucson, Arizona.

16:00.193 --> 16:05.465
Oh, I love Arizona. They sell
fireworks in grocery stores.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.534
So, the other night,
after y'all left,

16:07.567 --> 16:10.003
I did something
Marjorie told me to do.

16:10.037 --> 16:12.672
I sat quietly and I tried
to meditate.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.774
Next thing I knew,
I was sobbing.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.744
I'm talking
uncontrollable sobbing.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.147
I don't know if that's
a normal part of meditating,

16:20.180 --> 16:22.415
but it caught me by surprise.

16:22.449 --> 16:24.284
Why didn't you
call one of us?

16:24.317 --> 16:26.753
Oh, 'cause it was a good thing.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.557
Feel like I cried over all the
stuff I've done to hurt myself.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.526
All the drinking,
all the men, all the drugs.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.096
Now it's food.

16:36.129 --> 16:40.367
All 'cause I don't want
to face my feelings.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.469
(distorted):
It's time for me to do...

16:42.502 --> 16:45.505
No, no, no.
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.474
What are you doing?
It's not an Etch A Sketch.

16:48.741 --> 16:51.178
That's what I'm gonna do.
What do you think?

16:53.513 --> 16:56.049
Terrific.
Great!
Proud of you.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.186
So, I'm hoping
while I'm at the spa,

16:59.219 --> 17:01.521
I can fix that hole in myself.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.490
They do classes
on mindfulness and stuff

17:03.523 --> 17:07.094
to open up your chakras.
It's real spiritual.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.130
On the last day,
you get to talk to a horse.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.801
Anyway, the next time
you see me,

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
(distorted):
I'm gonna be...

17:16.436 --> 17:20.240
You'll be what?
A redhead? A juggler?

17:20.273 --> 17:22.209
Married to the horse?

17:22.242 --> 17:24.111
Maybe just smile and wave.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.245
Bye, Jill.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.580
Bring back
some Roman candles.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.784
Sounds like she'll
be gone a while.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.087
Well, I'm glad she's
taking care of herself.

17:34.121 --> 17:35.122
Yeah.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.857
Hey, you remember
the security code for her house?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.760
I do.
You thinking what I'm thinking?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.695
Soft serve and a dip
in the pool?

17:45.698 --> 17:47.066
Check, please.

17:48.468 --> 17:51.538
Oh, God, Jill's not here.
Who's gonna pay?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.819
Impressive.
How'd you do that?

18:06.853 --> 18:09.556
I hate to admit it, but Wendy
showed me some tricks.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.225
You look sad.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.693
I kind of am.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.663
See? You're in pain,
and now I'm interested.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.299
What's going on?

18:19.332 --> 18:22.502
I feel like applying to Stanford
was a huge mistake.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.237
Why?
(sighs)

18:24.271 --> 18:27.774
Now I'll be tortured for months
waiting to find out if I got in.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.743
If I didn't, I'll be crushed.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.479
And if I did, holy crap.

18:32.512 --> 18:34.147
I'll have to go to Stanford.

18:34.181 --> 18:37.917
Can... can we pause a second
and compare your life today

18:37.950 --> 18:40.387
to where you were
five years ago?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.854
Your biggest problem used to be

18:41.888 --> 18:45.692
how to give a satisfying
lap dance to a fat guy.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.863
And now, you know,
here you are worried

18:50.897 --> 18:53.600
about getting into one of
the best schools in the country.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.535
You're right.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.704
Look at me with
my classy problems.

18:57.737 --> 19:02.375
Whatever happens, I'm just
proud of you for applying.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.578
Thanks, Mom.

19:05.612 --> 19:09.182
(laughing)

19:09.216 --> 19:09.816
What?

19:09.849 --> 19:12.151
(laughing):
Nothing.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.755
Just you going to Stanford.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.825
It's funny.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.794
Hey, why don't you apply
to Harvard while you're at it?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.930
(mocking laughter)

19:23.963 --> 19:24.931
Oh...

19:24.964 --> 19:28.668
Oh, uh, hey, could I see that
for a second?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.370
Yeah.
Thanks.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.905
Oh!

19:36.476 --> 19:38.678
Looks like a job for duct tape!
