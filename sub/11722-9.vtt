00:00.017 --> 00:01.216
Previously on "The Secret Circle"...

00:01.900 --> 00:02.790
"My sweet Cassie,

00:03.120 --> 00:04.421
you finding this
means I'm gone,

00:04.452 --> 00:05.503
and for that,
I am so sorry.

00:05.531 --> 00:07.201
I didn't want you
to have this life,

00:07.255 --> 00:09.666
but destiny's
not easy to run from."

00:09.780 --> 00:10.512
Hi, I'm Diana.

00:10.514 --> 00:12.548
- You seen her yet?
- She got in yesterday.

00:12.549 --> 00:14.262
- We're different.
- You're different.

00:14.263 --> 00:15.031
You're a witch.

00:15.032 --> 00:17.454
You're a full-blooded,
100% witch.

00:17.455 --> 00:19.944
With her here,
we have real power now.

00:19.945 --> 00:21.526
A complete circle
is six.

00:21.527 --> 00:22.941
You complete
the circle.

00:22.942 --> 00:23.970
She's got the gift.

00:23.971 --> 00:26.382
You can get Cassie
to do what we need.

00:26.383 --> 00:28.752
The circle will take care of
that without even knowing it.

00:28.753 --> 00:29.908
Jane was performing a spell

00:29.909 --> 00:31.392
over his body when I got there.

00:32.019 --> 00:35.207
We've got to figure out a way
to control Jane's memory.

00:35.241 --> 00:37.993
There was a guy in
Nick's yard last night.

00:38.027 --> 00:39.260
It must have been
his older brother Jake.

00:39.262 --> 00:41.962
There's no way I am going to let
Jake be a part of this circle.

00:41.996 --> 00:44.033
I've been accused of doing
a lot of things tonight.

00:44.036 --> 00:46.690
Maybe I should try
at least one of them.

00:46.691 --> 00:50.684
Cassie's magic is stronger
than anything I've ever experienced.

00:50.696 --> 00:52.632
She has dark magic
inside her.

00:52.666 --> 00:55.060
So why are you
so desperate to tell her?

00:55.099 --> 00:56.259
So she can fight it!

00:56.309 --> 00:58.354
The antiquities dealer left
her some kind of warning.

00:58.388 --> 00:59.808
I need to figure out
what it is.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.260
It's time for
the witches to die.

01:01.333 --> 01:02.586
And all that's left
for you to do is

01:02.621 --> 01:05.718
to decide whether you're
still one of them.

01:12.738 --> 01:14.219
What does it mean?

01:14.246 --> 01:15.111
I don't know.

01:15.151 --> 01:17.245
There's nothing familiar
here at all.

01:17.273 --> 01:20.076
I just... I thought
because it has your initials...

01:20.111 --> 01:24.581
I wish I recognized any of
these symbols, but I don't.

01:24.611 --> 01:28.247
What exactly did Calvin say
to you when he gave you this?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.455
That I was in danger.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.190
Then he hung up,
and 5 minutes later,

01:31.224 --> 01:32.292
we were attacked
by witch hunters.

01:32.327 --> 01:34.205
I called his store
a bunch of times,

01:34.309 --> 01:35.589
but no one answers.

01:35.591 --> 01:36.344
Keep trying.

01:36.377 --> 01:37.864
I'll check with
Henry Chamberlain.

01:37.866 --> 01:39.099
He might know
what this is.

01:39.142 --> 01:40.748
Faye's grandfather?

01:40.766 --> 01:43.713
Yes. He's an elder,
and we're old friends.

01:43.805 --> 01:49.355
Grandma... He died.

01:53.842 --> 01:56.357
Of course he did.

01:57.103 --> 01:59.791
I'm sorry, it's been
a stressful week,

01:59.820 --> 02:02.432
and I'm not
sleeping well.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.748
Don't worry.

02:05.782 --> 02:08.334
I'm fine, I promise.

02:08.377 --> 02:11.474
Ok. Ok.

02:12.142 --> 02:14.144
All right.
I better get to school.

02:14.165 --> 02:18.614
But I'll let you know if I
can get a hold of Calvin.

02:52.420 --> 02:54.838
Hey, emo girl.

02:56.002 --> 02:58.759
You jerk.
What are you doing here?

02:58.793 --> 03:01.518
Helping your dad with
the big shindig tonight.

03:01.546 --> 03:04.158
He asked you to come to
check up on me, didn't he?

03:04.182 --> 03:06.678
I'd say rumors of
your depression

03:06.679 --> 03:08.953
were greatly underexaggerated.

03:08.982 --> 03:13.554
Yeah, well,
my boyfriend died.

03:14.025 --> 03:17.153
I know. I'm sorry.

03:17.187 --> 03:20.282
I can't stop being sad.

03:20.389 --> 03:21.516
I'm here now.

03:21.538 --> 03:24.955
I'm just going to have to annoy
it right out of your system.

03:24.993 --> 03:27.571
Mm-hmm.

03:27.620 --> 03:30.165
Hey, Melissa. Hi.

03:30.199 --> 03:31.380
You're Melissa's cousin.

03:31.414 --> 03:33.489
Holden, you remember Diana.

03:33.523 --> 03:35.800
No. Nice to meet you.

03:35.841 --> 03:36.982
You don't remember her?

03:37.007 --> 03:40.339
She had the biggest crush on
you when she was, like, 12.

03:40.373 --> 03:42.747
She stopped by the house
all the time that summer.

03:42.801 --> 03:45.478
Oh, my God, Melissa.
She's totally exaggerating.

03:45.517 --> 03:48.484
Now I remember.
You were the one who made a necklace

03:48.508 --> 03:51.379
out of ribbons you won at
the academic decathlon.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.811
Yeah. That's her.

03:52.852 --> 03:54.711
I officially hate you.
Forever.

03:54.730 --> 03:57.021
So, what brings you
to town?

03:57.055 --> 03:59.411
Helping Melissa's dad out
with the gala tonight.

03:59.445 --> 04:01.276
Taking a semester
off school.

04:01.327 --> 04:04.938
UCLA encourages outreach
to disadvantaged cousins.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.357
Very charitable of you.

04:06.391 --> 04:09.396
So, I guess
I'll see you tonight.

04:09.412 --> 04:11.572
Yeah.

04:15.039 --> 04:17.202
- What?
- Ugh!

04:21.536 --> 04:23.929
Well, this is
a rare visit.

04:23.931 --> 04:26.931
Are you ok?

04:27.112 --> 04:31.093
I can't stop thinking
about grandpa.

04:33.021 --> 04:35.255
I'm so sorry, honey.

04:35.274 --> 04:39.484
It's horrible you were
the one to find him.

04:44.064 --> 04:46.567
He would want us
to be strong.

04:46.601 --> 04:48.563
And I need
your strength too.

04:48.597 --> 04:52.514
The maritime memorial
fundraising gala is tonight.

04:52.630 --> 04:54.807
You're still going?

04:55.000 --> 04:58.386
I'm co-chair with Melissa's dad.
I have to go.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.357
There's been a death
in the family.

05:00.508 --> 05:02.056
No one will care
if you miss it.

05:02.089 --> 05:05.112
Faye,
I have responsibilities.

05:05.131 --> 05:07.426
You don't care about
granddad, do you?

05:07.460 --> 05:08.429
That's not fair.

05:08.463 --> 05:10.387
Our relationship
wasn't easy,

05:10.423 --> 05:13.967
but he played his part
in that, too.

05:14.084 --> 05:15.354
Really?

05:15.394 --> 05:17.262
It looked to me like
you pushed him away.

05:17.296 --> 05:21.277
That's why he stayed at the
lake house all the time,

05:21.311 --> 05:25.705
because you wouldn't
let him into our life.

05:25.751 --> 05:27.444
Maybe this is
your fault.

05:27.478 --> 05:29.991
Don't talk to me
like that.

05:30.032 --> 05:31.922
Our history was
complicated.

05:31.947 --> 05:33.245
You don't know
the whole story.

05:33.277 --> 05:37.318
Doesn't matter now,
does it?

05:37.348 --> 05:39.800
Not to him, anyway.

05:58.637 --> 06:01.896
Actually, no, we don't call
it the Scooby-doo magic shack.

06:01.939 --> 06:06.520
I like it.
Kind of a girlier "lost boys" vibe.

06:07.677 --> 06:10.152
Let me go turn on
the lights.

06:20.855 --> 06:24.795
Hey, I saw that.

06:24.838 --> 06:27.879
What are you up to?

06:27.919 --> 06:31.049
What are you
really doing here?

06:31.093 --> 06:33.200
- I brought him.
- Mm-mm.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.375
The Jake I knew hated
this town.

06:35.400 --> 06:39.568
He'd never hang around
here like a retiree.

06:39.603 --> 06:41.676
But he would steal.

06:45.743 --> 06:46.986
Jasper.

06:47.030 --> 06:48.234
It's my family's stone.

06:48.293 --> 06:49.925
I was going to put it
at Nick's grave.

06:50.119 --> 06:52.432
Don't play
the death card with me.

06:52.434 --> 06:53.627
Faye,
that's enough.

06:53.661 --> 06:56.042
I know this is going to be a
blow to your overinflated ego,

06:56.076 --> 06:59.079
but you don't know me.
You never did.

06:59.094 --> 07:00.345
You're wrong.

07:00.370 --> 07:05.016
And proving it to these suckers
is going to do my ego wonders.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.353
Sorry.

07:14.386 --> 07:15.278
Not your fault.

07:15.303 --> 07:18.212
That's all my mistake.

07:18.246 --> 07:20.919
- Let's take a look at these.
- Yeah.

07:26.273 --> 07:31.272
Ok. How do you
figure out the symbols?

07:34.063 --> 07:36.038
Don't know.

07:39.327 --> 07:42.885
Ah. But look at this.

07:42.887 --> 07:47.177
Witches used
to separate paper,

07:47.220 --> 07:50.617
write messages
on the inside.

07:50.634 --> 07:51.640
What?

07:51.676 --> 07:53.950
And then put it
back together.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.220
I'm impressed.

07:58.429 --> 08:01.049
That's my father.

08:01.195 --> 08:02.729
John Blackwell?

08:02.771 --> 08:04.593
Yeah. J.B.

08:04.627 --> 08:08.356
I'm so stupid for not
making the connection.

08:08.358 --> 08:13.144
He died in the same fire
that your parents did.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.147
But that's pretty much
everything I know about him.

08:16.149 --> 08:18.474
Your mom never
talked about him?

08:18.511 --> 08:23.365
Hmm. Maybe it was
too painful.

08:23.415 --> 08:26.747
After a while,
I just stopped asking.

08:28.444 --> 08:30.159
But now...

08:30.173 --> 08:32.874
Here he is,
my whole history.

08:32.924 --> 08:37.173
Father, grandfather.

08:37.196 --> 08:40.313
Who are they?

08:42.011 --> 08:44.188
Why did Calvin
give me this?

08:44.222 --> 08:47.271
How does it protect me?
From what?

08:47.308 --> 08:49.798
I don't know.

08:49.813 --> 08:50.940
Well,
I have to ask him.

08:50.978 --> 08:52.872
- Want to go with me?
- I can't.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.455
I need to take care
of something.

08:55.492 --> 08:56.646
I'm sorry.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.862
But let me know
what he says.

08:57.901 --> 09:00.325
I just... I just thought you
could help figure it out...

09:00.359 --> 09:02.039
I know.
I wish I could.

09:02.085 --> 09:05.564
But those symbols don't
make any sense to me.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.539
I'm sure
Calvin will know.

09:13.726 --> 09:15.369
It was
the strangest thing.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.301
I searched the Blackwell family
tree on the Internet for hours

09:18.335 --> 09:20.139
and came up
completely blank.

09:20.174 --> 09:22.807
How can a family this big not
have a single hit online?

09:22.844 --> 09:23.712
I don't know.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.240
But it gives me
a bad feeling.

09:25.266 --> 09:26.560
Did you ask your
grandmother about it?

09:26.591 --> 09:30.401
Not yet. She's helping with the
maritime fundraiser today.

09:30.435 --> 09:32.194
Are you going?

09:32.228 --> 09:36.560
I was actually thinking about
inviting Jake.

09:36.581 --> 09:41.075
But then, he was...
A little weird today.

09:41.077 --> 09:41.852
You know,
kind of distant.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.110
Come on. You guys kissed
at the lake house.

09:44.219 --> 09:46.336
It's obvious there's
something between you two.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.421
Definitely ask him.

09:47.457 --> 09:48.922
Mmm. I'll think about it.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.628
- So, what about you? You going?
- Yep.

09:51.684 --> 09:53.276
Solo. I'm single now.

09:53.311 --> 09:56.099
It's pretty
empowering, actually,

09:56.132 --> 09:59.713
when I'm not desperately
missing Adam.

10:01.982 --> 10:05.048
- Mind?
- Yeah.

10:21.453 --> 10:25.303
Cassie's dark magic
comes from Balcoin.

10:27.203 --> 10:29.499
That's not possible.

10:29.551 --> 10:31.406
The Balcoin line
was eradicated.

10:31.440 --> 10:33.132
Hidden,
but not eradicated.

10:33.324 --> 10:35.727
The name was changed
to Blackwell.

10:35.884 --> 10:37.421
Cassie's father was
John Blackwell.

10:37.455 --> 10:41.171
He died in the fire and would've
been the last in the Balcoin line...

10:41.218 --> 10:43.336
until Cassie.

10:43.338 --> 10:45.470
Balcoin is at the
origin of black magic.

10:45.473 --> 10:47.865
And Cassie has darker energy
than we ever thought.

10:47.891 --> 10:50.925
Reversing the power of
the witch cruet on Luke

10:50.959 --> 10:53.416
was just the tip of
what she's capable of.

10:53.450 --> 10:55.614
Killing her is
no longer an option.

10:55.648 --> 10:57.302
Her fate is for the
council to decide.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.617
We'll leave
in the morning

10:58.651 --> 10:59.910
and present this
new information.

10:59.942 --> 11:03.463
I could stay.
Keep an eye on her.

11:03.497 --> 11:06.368
You have feelings
for her.

11:06.411 --> 11:09.540
No. None.

11:11.581 --> 11:12.450
This is my fault.

11:12.484 --> 11:14.288
I put you in
the middle of all this.

11:14.322 --> 11:16.719
And it's natural you feel
connected to them somehow.

11:16.763 --> 11:21.203
But you can't let emotion cloud
what you know to be true.

11:21.238 --> 11:22.966
Witchcraft killed
your family.

11:23.000 --> 11:26.612
It's killed thousands of innocents,
and it will kill more if we let it.

11:26.632 --> 11:28.515
Allowing that truth
to guide you,

11:28.536 --> 11:30.887
that's what makes you
different from them.

11:30.943 --> 11:36.186
When I found you, you were filled
with pain and self-hatred.

11:36.190 --> 11:39.446
And now, you're on
the verge of redemption.

11:39.785 --> 11:42.955
You need to leave here before
you lose sight of that.

11:42.987 --> 11:46.280
You're right.

11:47.168 --> 11:49.956
We'll leave tomorrow.

12:15.531 --> 12:18.131
Calvin?

12:55.060 --> 12:55.910
Going somewhere?

12:55.930 --> 12:59.904
Just cleaning out
some of Nick's stuff.

12:59.932 --> 13:01.730
Ahh.

13:03.905 --> 13:05.926
Is everything ok?

13:05.933 --> 13:08.520
Sure.

13:08.522 --> 13:12.998
I went by Calvin's place.
Still locked up.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.668
It's so strange.

13:15.699 --> 13:17.758
- Maybe he's away.
- Yeah.

13:17.793 --> 13:19.369
Diana and I tried to
find out some stuff

13:19.403 --> 13:22.415
about my dad, or any of
the blackwells. And nothing.

13:22.428 --> 13:26.512
Sorry I couldn't be
more helpful.

13:28.423 --> 13:30.828
Is everything really ok?

13:30.830 --> 13:33.547
You seem...Weird.

13:33.650 --> 13:37.413
No weirder than usual.

13:37.447 --> 13:40.352
Ok, good.

13:44.088 --> 13:46.243
So, uh...

13:46.277 --> 13:47.862
The maritime fundraiser
is tonight.

13:47.907 --> 13:52.104
And I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to go with me.

13:52.106 --> 13:56.217
I don't think so.

13:58.216 --> 13:59.248
Oh.

13:59.282 --> 14:03.542
Uh, yeah, I... I figured.

14:09.139 --> 14:10.626
Why not?

14:10.811 --> 14:11.846
What, I'm good enough to kiss,

14:11.883 --> 14:14.557
but not good enough to
actually go on a date with?

14:14.590 --> 14:16.480
Do you really want
to do this?

14:16.519 --> 14:19.856
No, not at all.
But I just... I don't understand.

14:19.908 --> 14:22.476
I thought we were headed
in a good direction.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.738
Good direction?

14:23.769 --> 14:25.491
Because why?
Truth or dare?

14:25.504 --> 14:28.398
- Not just that...
- You're a nice girl,

14:28.453 --> 14:29.618
but I'm not interested.

14:29.652 --> 14:32.645
Sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

14:32.668 --> 14:34.188
You don't mean that.

14:34.223 --> 14:35.734
Yeah, I do, actually.

14:35.736 --> 14:36.982
There is something
between us.

14:36.992 --> 14:38.309
I felt it.
And I still feel it,

14:38.327 --> 14:40.928
even in this second, when
you're acting like a jerk.

14:40.951 --> 14:43.684
This isn't me acting
like a jerk, Cassie.

14:43.718 --> 14:47.669
This is me trying
to be nice.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.986
I'm not interested.

14:51.020 --> 14:55.617
What part of that
don't you understand?

15:17.066 --> 15:18.542
Thanks.

15:24.802 --> 15:26.423
Word gets out
you're free,

15:26.458 --> 15:27.800
they just come
buzzing around.

15:27.833 --> 15:30.889
What do you want, faye?
I'm busy.

15:30.920 --> 15:32.733
We need to talk
somewhere quiet.

15:32.777 --> 15:33.987
Oh, if this is
your desperate way

15:33.989 --> 15:36.600
of asking me to the gala,
the answer's no.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.487
I'm crushed. Truly.

15:39.526 --> 15:41.340
Come on.

15:48.382 --> 15:50.851
I think you're right
about Jake.

15:50.885 --> 15:51.952
He's up to something.

15:51.996 --> 15:53.441
Is this because he's
hanging out with Cassie?

15:53.443 --> 15:56.913
Yes, actually. But not in the
weird, misguided jealousy way

15:56.948 --> 15:58.531
you have going on
in your head.

15:58.565 --> 15:59.612
So what is the problem?

15:59.665 --> 16:02.031
I know Jake better than
anyone, and I'm telling you,

16:02.065 --> 16:06.000
joining the circle, spending all
this time with us, with her...

16:06.033 --> 16:07.832
There's something
weird about it.

16:07.874 --> 16:12.584
I know. What, exactly?

16:12.595 --> 16:15.270
I don't know.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.460
But...

16:16.524 --> 16:19.251
Cassie brought him to
the abandoned house today...

16:19.269 --> 16:19.904
She did?

16:19.938 --> 16:23.381
He was too curious,
too interested.

16:23.415 --> 16:26.561
- In the house or her?
- Both.

16:26.563 --> 16:28.520
Jake doesn't do
interested.

16:28.630 --> 16:31.967
Him not caring is
what makes him, him.

16:32.002 --> 16:36.585
He's after something.
Trust me.

16:49.135 --> 16:50.115
What?

16:50.131 --> 16:52.042
I saw that.

16:52.084 --> 16:54.278
It was just...

16:54.297 --> 16:56.914
Somehow, he got even
cuter, that's all.

16:58.789 --> 17:00.807
Yeah. It's nice
to have him here.

17:00.846 --> 17:02.955
No matter how bad
life gets,

17:02.974 --> 17:05.342
holden always
makes me laugh.

17:05.396 --> 17:07.228
I could use
some of that.

17:07.268 --> 17:12.598
He's not a rebound guy, Diana.

17:13.903 --> 17:15.401
Ladies.

17:15.440 --> 17:16.809
Guess we're
supposed to put

17:16.823 --> 17:18.272
one of these
on every table?

17:18.307 --> 17:19.308
Yeah, that's right.

17:19.326 --> 17:21.444
Then you'd better get started.

17:21.479 --> 17:23.622
Yeah.

17:25.866 --> 17:27.663
- Right behind you.
- Mm-hmm.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.480
I'm always looking for new ways
to get her to glare at me.

17:32.589 --> 17:35.891
All right.

17:42.363 --> 17:45.002
You're late.

17:46.683 --> 17:49.856
And you are lovely.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.306
How's the crystal?

17:53.340 --> 17:56.679
Safe and sound.
No need to worry.

17:56.697 --> 18:01.860
It must be difficult for
you to resist its draw.

18:01.894 --> 18:07.526
I know how you miss
the feeling of power.

18:07.528 --> 18:09.713
Maybe you should give
it to me to hold.

18:09.756 --> 18:14.294
I'm going to keep it,
Dawn.

18:15.526 --> 18:16.576
Let's get going.

18:16.637 --> 18:19.424
But I did have
a thought.

18:19.464 --> 18:22.067
Now that we know where
Diana keeps her book,

18:22.096 --> 18:24.813
we can look for alternatives
to the blood moon ceremony.

18:24.864 --> 18:28.768
Find out how to locate
the other crystals.

18:28.830 --> 18:29.900
Henry's body
just turned up dead

18:29.938 --> 18:32.683
because you didn't hide it
well enough the first time.

18:32.685 --> 18:34.403
Your mistake forced us
to silence Jane.

18:34.445 --> 18:35.679
If you think
the rest of the elders

18:35.713 --> 18:37.743
aren't paying attention to this
town right now, you're a fool.

18:37.779 --> 18:41.738
I think we just need to lay low with
the crystal for a little while.

18:41.779 --> 18:46.915
Fine. That's probably a good idea.

18:47.696 --> 18:51.732
You may have the crystal,
but you still need me.

18:51.747 --> 18:55.624
Let's not forget that.

19:55.104 --> 19:56.845
You look magnificent.

19:56.897 --> 19:59.158
Thanks.

19:59.186 --> 20:00.230
Hey, grandma,

20:00.268 --> 20:03.440
I found this family tree
inside the parchment.

20:03.474 --> 20:06.777
Do you know anything about
the Blackwell family line?

20:10.495 --> 20:12.710
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.816
I...

20:14.833 --> 20:18.958
I don't know. I'm sorry.
What did you say?

20:18.992 --> 20:21.333
I asked you if you knew anything

20:21.334 --> 20:24.039
about John Blackwell's
family tree.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.843
No.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.112
I never met anyone
in that family.

20:28.113 --> 20:28.671
Oh.

20:28.679 --> 20:31.234
And your mother never
talked about them.

20:31.236 --> 20:34.641
Oh. Ok.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.941
Would you get
the door, please?

20:36.972 --> 20:39.471
I need to find
my purse.

20:51.187 --> 20:53.044
What do you want?

20:53.081 --> 20:54.967
To apologize.

20:55.225 --> 20:57.869
For stealing those
from our garden?

20:57.875 --> 21:01.459
Ok, two things.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.892
I feel something between
the two of us, too.

21:04.936 --> 21:07.666
I'm just not totally sure
how to deal with it.

21:07.668 --> 21:10.200
Well, what you've been
trying so far

21:10.201 --> 21:12.969
hasn't worked,
if that helps.

21:13.014 --> 21:15.992
I know. And I'm sorry.

21:16.026 --> 21:18.109
You just sort of
took me by surprise

21:18.169 --> 21:21.097
from the first time
we met.

21:22.265 --> 21:24.525
I know it's probably
too late,

21:24.559 --> 21:30.392
but I'd be honored to go to the
fundraiser with you tonight.

21:57.681 --> 22:02.139
Hi. Can I get two more, please?
A red and a white?

22:02.173 --> 22:04.843
Thank you.

22:11.897 --> 22:13.317
Jane.

22:13.351 --> 22:17.032
You're looking
very nice this evening.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.800
Thank you, Charles.

22:22.487 --> 22:24.303
Are you all right?

22:24.466 --> 22:26.467
I'm fine.

22:26.507 --> 22:31.247
Just enjoying watching
Amelia have fun.

22:35.253 --> 22:38.250
You mean Cassie.

22:53.539 --> 22:57.057
Remember, you're supposed
to keep an eye on Jake,

22:57.079 --> 22:59.126
not Diana.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.778
You want a drink
or something?

23:01.831 --> 23:03.576
As long as we're here.

23:03.589 --> 23:06.958
Sure. How about something
with an olive?

23:07.006 --> 23:10.741
How about whatever I can con
the bartender into giving me?

23:10.768 --> 23:14.933
And try not to let Jake
get away while I'm gone.

23:27.647 --> 23:29.355
We're going to dance.

23:29.404 --> 23:31.320
Oh, really?

23:31.371 --> 23:33.444
Yep.

23:48.243 --> 23:49.689
I'm trying to...

23:49.690 --> 23:53.756
Picture my mother here
when she was my age,

23:53.790 --> 23:58.335
all dressed up,
dancing.

23:58.386 --> 24:01.342
Maybe with my father.

24:03.091 --> 24:04.758
Since we found
that family tree today,

24:04.792 --> 24:07.985
I can't stop
thinking about him.

24:08.025 --> 24:10.414
I never told
my mom this,

24:10.450 --> 24:12.615
because I knew
it would upset her,

24:12.649 --> 24:14.793
but when I was little,

24:14.827 --> 24:18.526
I created an imaginary
version of my father.

24:18.571 --> 24:22.543
And I would just talk
to him all the time.

24:22.677 --> 24:24.888
I made up all the things that

24:24.889 --> 24:27.327
she never told me about him...

24:27.329 --> 24:31.100
where he was from,
the kind of foods he liked,

24:31.132 --> 24:34.045
what kind of tea he would
drink at tea parties.

24:36.565 --> 24:40.845
How proud he was of me.

24:46.520 --> 24:47.965
Sorry.

24:48.798 --> 24:49.948
Look who
I'm talking too.

24:49.981 --> 24:54.115
You lost both your parents
at the same time.

24:57.153 --> 25:00.188
I talked to Nick once.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.281
Before...

25:01.312 --> 25:06.852
he told me that this blonde
girl moved next door

25:06.854 --> 25:10.214
into the Blake house...

25:10.216 --> 25:14.895
short, sad.

25:14.924 --> 25:16.709
But strong.

25:16.752 --> 25:18.483
A survivor.

25:18.511 --> 25:21.672
He admired her.

25:21.706 --> 25:24.859
I guess he was talking
about you.

25:45.089 --> 25:46.562
What?

25:47.193 --> 25:49.247
Nothing.

25:49.281 --> 25:52.520
I'll be right back.

26:18.151 --> 26:20.937
You're the only girl I know
here that I'm not related to.

26:20.944 --> 26:23.443
Any chance
you'd want to dance?

26:24.635 --> 26:25.796
Oh, I don't know.

26:26.158 --> 26:30.283
Don't know how?
I'll show you. Come on.

26:48.827 --> 26:50.371
What are you doing here?

26:50.417 --> 26:52.620
I came to find you.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.300
The plan has changed.

26:54.302 --> 26:55.891
I spoke to the council,

26:55.892 --> 26:58.008
and there's more
going on than you know.

26:59.890 --> 27:02.706
We're taking Cassie
with us.

27:02.755 --> 27:05.529
And we're leaving
tonight.

27:20.307 --> 27:22.155
We're bringing Cassie
with us?

27:22.157 --> 27:24.971
You are. From here, where
no one will notice.

27:25.005 --> 27:26.450
I don't think
that's a good idea.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.201
Kidnapping's the kind of thing
that might set her off.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.387
That's why
I'm coming to you.

27:31.422 --> 27:32.381
She trusts you.

27:32.415 --> 27:33.855
She won't leave
her friends.

27:33.895 --> 27:36.362
She will for you.

27:37.484 --> 27:39.587
Find a way.

27:39.616 --> 27:41.110
Bring her
to the council.

27:41.239 --> 27:42.557
Unless you can't.

27:42.565 --> 27:46.033
In which case, you need
to tell me right now.

27:47.765 --> 27:48.782
Of course I can.

27:48.896 --> 27:51.577
The council thinks it's too
dangerous to leave her here.

27:51.778 --> 27:55.746
They want to use her
power to our advantage,

27:55.903 --> 27:59.946
just like
we have with you...

27:59.979 --> 28:02.743
fighting fire with fire.

28:02.761 --> 28:04.841
That's what you said.

28:05.331 --> 28:07.180
Yes.

28:07.279 --> 28:11.175
I'll find a way to get her
out of here and to the boat.

28:11.209 --> 28:13.514
Good.

28:24.742 --> 28:25.569
Cassie.

28:25.574 --> 28:27.193
You're back.
I'm pleasantly surprised.

28:27.227 --> 28:29.001
You need to come with me.

28:29.043 --> 28:32.072
- It's important. Trust me.
- Ok.

28:41.842 --> 28:43.597
Here. My mother bought
the good stuff.

28:43.643 --> 28:45.100
You know.
Impress the donors.

28:45.142 --> 28:46.563
Jake is a witch hunter.

28:46.597 --> 28:47.854
How do you know?

28:47.884 --> 28:50.052
I just saw him talking
to the head witch hunter

28:50.053 --> 28:51.798
who tried to kill us.

28:51.833 --> 28:54.134
We got to tell
the others.

28:54.864 --> 28:57.149
And find Cassie.

29:02.812 --> 29:04.156
Is that your ex?

29:04.199 --> 29:06.613
Melissa told me
all about it.

29:06.624 --> 29:08.209
Yeah, it is.

29:08.243 --> 29:11.940
I'm sorry to do this,
but I should go.

29:11.961 --> 29:13.713
- Rain check?
- Sure.

29:13.740 --> 29:15.958
No problem.

29:20.330 --> 29:21.927
She's not picking up.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.793
If they left,
where would he take her?

29:23.795 --> 29:24.665
- Home?
- Ok.

29:24.742 --> 29:25.962
Faye and I
will look there.

29:25.977 --> 29:27.002
Let's check outside.

29:27.052 --> 29:29.603
Call us
if you find them.

29:31.774 --> 29:34.168
If this was just
your lame attempt

29:34.169 --> 29:36.972
to get me back to your room...

29:37.789 --> 29:40.493
Is that your family's
book of shadows?

29:40.495 --> 29:45.905
You said you wanted to know
more about your father.

29:46.359 --> 29:47.649
What do you know
about him?

29:47.675 --> 29:50.418
Your father comes from a very
powerful line of witches

29:50.462 --> 29:54.291
that originated from
a man named Balcoin.

29:55.734 --> 29:57.565
These pages are a
warning about

29:57.566 --> 29:59.552
the destructive power of darkness,

30:04.181 --> 30:06.884
And how it can transform
someone into evil.

30:14.952 --> 30:16.922
What is this?

30:17.356 --> 30:18.385
Why are you showing me?

30:18.445 --> 30:20.209
Because you need to know
where you come from.

30:20.211 --> 30:22.315
Your ancestors did
terrible things.

30:22.349 --> 30:24.902
Your father's lineage is
from strong dark magic.

30:24.937 --> 30:27.729
That's why you have
the power you do,

30:27.787 --> 30:29.913
outside the circle.

30:32.150 --> 30:35.703
You're telling me my
ancestors were monsters?

30:35.705 --> 30:38.323
So that's
what you think I am?

30:38.357 --> 30:39.753
No, I don't.

30:39.791 --> 30:41.383
That's why
I'm telling you,

30:41.420 --> 30:43.987
why I'm trusting you
with this.

30:44.006 --> 30:45.099
Trust?

30:45.220 --> 30:48.927
So this is why you pulled away
from me before, isn't it?

30:48.983 --> 30:50.318
You knew.

30:50.351 --> 30:53.042
You know at the lake house,
when Simone attacked you...

30:53.064 --> 30:54.225
you knew the whole time.

30:54.266 --> 30:56.310
What have you been doing,
studying me?

30:56.352 --> 30:58.068
I knew you were special,

30:58.196 --> 31:00.011
not that the Blackwell
name used to be Balcoin.

31:00.045 --> 31:01.342
400 years ago?

31:01.343 --> 31:04.769
That's what has you
so freaked out?

31:04.829 --> 31:05.828
Get off of me.

31:05.859 --> 31:08.034
This is what Calvin was
trying to warn you about.

31:08.068 --> 31:11.605
Having this bloodline
makes you a target.

31:11.666 --> 31:14.902
You have power inside you
that others want.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.456
We have to leave here.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.066
You want me
to go with you?

31:19.098 --> 31:21.537
That's never going
to happen.

31:21.571 --> 31:24.432
I'm not leaving my
grandma or my friends.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.771
Staying puts
all of them in jeopardy.

31:26.807 --> 31:28.931
Staying together
keeps us stronger.

31:28.980 --> 31:30.513
What if someone
comes after them,

31:30.562 --> 31:32.262
and I'm out there
hiding?

31:32.274 --> 31:34.721
Did you leaving
help Nick?

31:43.678 --> 31:45.931
<i>Jake is a witch hunter.</i>

31:53.679 --> 31:56.105
What is it?

31:57.844 --> 31:59.553
Nothing.

31:59.598 --> 32:02.004
Just Diana checking in.

32:07.677 --> 32:10.618
Everything that you're...
you're telling me,

32:10.663 --> 32:12.520
it's just a lot to take in.

32:12.521 --> 32:15.080
You have to trust me.
I know you did once.

32:15.081 --> 32:17.521
I've made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

32:17.522 --> 32:19.057
Taking you away from here is

32:19.058 --> 32:20.496
the only way to make them right.

32:20.947 --> 32:23.243
But we have to go now.

32:26.023 --> 32:27.299
Ok. I'll, um...

32:27.338 --> 32:29.875
I'll just run to my house
and get my things.

32:29.876 --> 32:33.237
This is the right thing,
Cassie. I promise.

32:33.545 --> 32:36.736
You need to hurry.

32:36.770 --> 32:39.382
I will.

32:40.713 --> 32:43.621
- Cassie.
- Yeah?

32:45.614 --> 32:49.208
You really can trust me.

33:20.398 --> 33:21.600
Cassie?

33:24.101 --> 33:25.798
No!

33:47.235 --> 33:48.321
Jane.

33:48.368 --> 33:51.543
Are you all right?

33:51.581 --> 33:54.228
I'm not sure.
I'm a little dizzy.

33:54.421 --> 33:56.816
Maybe a migraine.

33:58.058 --> 34:00.886
You should sit down.

34:02.253 --> 34:03.983
I'm probably just tired.

34:04.017 --> 34:07.128
Too many double shifts
at the hospital.

34:07.897 --> 34:10.245
It's nice to see
you two together.

34:10.279 --> 34:11.820
Glad to see you're
taking an interest

34:11.933 --> 34:13.906
in someone other
than John Blackwell.

34:13.940 --> 34:16.893
Blackwell? What are you
talking about, Jane?

34:16.896 --> 34:21.268
Amelia always says
you worship him.

34:21.947 --> 34:23.739
Let me take you home.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.612
Thank you.
Just give me a minute.

34:31.480 --> 34:35.431
You know, I always thought you
had a little crush on Blackwell,

34:35.433 --> 34:37.195
but I guess it was
much more than that.

34:37.196 --> 34:39.623
He's dead.
What does it matter?

34:40.108 --> 34:42.324
You said the spell was just
supposed to make her forget

34:42.324 --> 34:43.560
everything that she saw
at the lake house.

34:43.561 --> 34:45.353
- What is wrong with her?
- I don't know.

34:46.603 --> 34:48.625
You obviously
didn't do it right.

34:49.444 --> 34:51.088
I'm getting a little sick
of your accusations.

34:51.089 --> 34:53.605
We did the spell.

34:53.606 --> 34:56.444
You chose it.
You did what you wanted to do.

34:56.445 --> 34:57.553
You kept the crystal.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.663
And you got the spell
from your family's book.

34:59.664 --> 35:04.742
So if Jane suffers any
long-term damage, it's on you.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.085
Where's Cassie?

35:17.131 --> 35:19.333
- Where is she?
- Get off...

35:19.367 --> 35:20.791
So you can run again, huh?

35:20.838 --> 35:23.203
Witch hunters.
They took her.

35:23.224 --> 35:25.274
You are a witch hunter!

35:25.308 --> 35:28.215
I know you hate me.

35:28.239 --> 35:29.538
I don't blame you.

35:29.663 --> 35:30.896
But Cassie's in trouble.

35:30.944 --> 35:32.933
You have
to help me save her.

35:32.983 --> 35:35.534
Help me, and I'll leave.
Forever.

35:35.568 --> 35:36.789
So first, you're
trying to kill us.

35:36.823 --> 35:38.316
And now, you're coming
to the rescue?

35:38.318 --> 35:40.583
- I don't buy it.
- It's Cassie.

35:40.762 --> 35:41.951
That's what
he cares about.

35:41.953 --> 35:43.938
It's an act, faye.
He's lying.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.785
No, he means it.

36:16.984 --> 36:18.387
Can you handle
a knife?

36:18.421 --> 36:19.970
Yes, I can handle a knife.

36:20.038 --> 36:21.060
There's 3 of us.
We can do magic.

36:21.094 --> 36:23.709
Magic won't work on the boat.
It's made of ash wood.

36:23.710 --> 36:24.619
And...

36:24.620 --> 36:26.377
It's like the circle
of ashes that took away

36:26.378 --> 36:27.576
your powers
on halloween.

36:27.577 --> 36:29.396
Oh, right. When you were
leading us to slaughter.

36:29.397 --> 36:30.587
I knew the situation
felt familiar.

36:30.588 --> 36:32.469
If you distract
and get them off the boat,

36:32.470 --> 36:33.505
I'll get Cassie.

36:33.654 --> 36:34.649
No.

36:34.951 --> 36:36.291
No way. You're not going
near her.

36:36.334 --> 36:38.085
You distract.
I'll go.

36:38.119 --> 36:41.546
Maybe blow yourself
up, if you have to.

36:55.808 --> 36:57.756
Come on.

37:22.806 --> 37:25.045
What's the plan?

37:26.460 --> 37:28.693
This.

37:28.727 --> 37:32.541
Imphatus bannacd.

37:34.830 --> 37:35.929
What was that?

37:38.253 --> 37:41.500
Imphatus bannacd.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.686
Ow, Ow!

38:01.244 --> 38:04.046
- Cassie. Cassie.
- Adam?

38:04.075 --> 38:06.420
Are you hurt?
You ok?

38:06.464 --> 38:10.046
Um...Yeah. I'm ok.

38:10.871 --> 38:12.874
I'm going to get you out of here.

38:12.884 --> 38:15.759
Thanks.

38:17.725 --> 38:20.394
Come on.

38:26.650 --> 38:28.892
Aah!

38:28.900 --> 38:32.234
You're not going
anywhere.

38:34.743 --> 38:35.547
- Let him go.
- Or what?

38:35.581 --> 38:37.287
Your magic won't
work on this boat.

38:37.340 --> 38:38.375
Are you sure
you want to try me?

38:38.409 --> 38:42.582
Last time I burned up
one of your hunters.

38:43.106 --> 38:46.304
Get out of here!

38:49.476 --> 38:50.526
Focus on the dock.

38:50.552 --> 38:53.471
Picture it in your head.
Flames, burn back our path.

38:53.526 --> 38:56.903
Flames,
burn back our path.

39:09.995 --> 39:12.040
You know what she is,
the Balcoin bloodline.

39:12.055 --> 39:14.635
It's not her fault.
It doesn't matter.

39:14.676 --> 39:17.090
She matters to me.

39:17.582 --> 39:19.645
Then you're a fool.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.809
Get us out of here.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.181
She can fight off
the darkness.

39:31.182 --> 39:34.706
The circle doesn't have
to be destructive.

39:35.738 --> 39:38.770
You don't know what
you're talking about.

39:38.804 --> 39:44.447
Cassie Blake is not the only child
of Blackwell in the circle.
