WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:02.636
DOLE:
Previously on "The Practice"

00:02.669 --> 00:05.305
Why are you so angry?

00:05.338 --> 00:06.206
DOLE: For pretending,

00:06.239 --> 00:08.374
day after day after day

00:08.408 --> 00:09.876
that my husband's
in love with me

00:09.910 --> 00:11.111
when I know he's not.

00:11.144 --> 00:13.947
Lindsay, for God's sake,

00:13.980 --> 00:15.348
of course I love you.

00:15.381 --> 00:16.416
DOLE: I know you love me,

00:16.449 --> 00:17.150
but...

00:18.552 --> 00:20.053
I miss being adored.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.757
Look, the idea of splitting up
is unmentionable.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.560
But Bobby,
other than our son,

00:29.262 --> 00:30.997
it is so dead in this home

00:33.299 --> 00:34.901
and has been for a while.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.575
I know this isn't
what you wanna hear.

00:41.608 --> 00:43.243
NANCY: No, it isn't.

00:43.276 --> 00:46.446
FRUTT: I'm not saying
we can't win on the elements,

00:46.479 --> 00:49.415
but the blood on your shoe

00:49.449 --> 00:52.252
and the fact that
you were seen coming and going,

00:52.285 --> 00:54.020
not to mention the threat.

00:54.054 --> 00:57.423
With insanity,
even in victory,

00:57.457 --> 00:58.759
she's gonna be locked up.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.267
FRUTT: No, she only goes away
until she gets better,

01:01.301 --> 01:03.203
which, from what the doctors
are telling us,

01:03.236 --> 01:04.805
could be soon.

01:04.837 --> 01:07.173
This is a circumstantial case.

01:07.207 --> 01:09.275
What she did
and what they can prove

01:09.308 --> 01:11.311
are two very different things.

01:11.344 --> 01:12.913
You said so yourself.

01:12.946 --> 01:14.981
FRUTT: Look, we'll do
what you want us to do,

01:15.015 --> 01:16.783
but we're telling you,
Nancy,

01:16.817 --> 01:19.052
your best chance
at seeing freedom again,

01:19.085 --> 01:21.922
your best chance by far,

01:21.955 --> 01:23.256
is insanity.

01:25.325 --> 01:27.794
And Kevin, I may be
stepping over the line here,

01:27.828 --> 01:30.230
but the reason I think
you're resisting the idea

01:30.263 --> 01:31.865
of your wife being insane

01:33.099 --> 01:35.536
is because you feel
responsible for it.

01:38.338 --> 01:42.843
(music playing)

02:27.661 --> 02:29.395
MARGARET: My sons
didn't get along.

02:29.429 --> 02:30.931
They were pretty much
estranged

02:30.964 --> 02:32.265
ever since the accident.

02:32.298 --> 02:35.001
WALSH: Which accident
was that, Mrs. Healy?

02:35.035 --> 02:37.403
Derek's son, Justin was 16.

02:37.437 --> 02:39.372
He had his learner's permit.

02:39.405 --> 02:40.641
He was driving.

02:40.674 --> 02:41.975
Kevin was with him.

02:42.008 --> 02:42.876
WALSH: To clarify,

02:42.909 --> 02:44.611
Kevin is the defendant's
husband?

02:44.645 --> 02:47.180
MARGARET: Yes,
and Derek's younger brother.

02:48.248 --> 02:50.050
Anyway, Justin was driving.

02:50.083 --> 02:53.319
Kevin was in the car
when the accident occurred.

02:53.353 --> 02:55.889
Justin was killed.

02:55.922 --> 02:58.358
Kevin was paralyzed.

02:58.391 --> 03:00.166
Derek blamed Kevin,

03:00.200 --> 03:02.569
claiming his lack
of supervision.

03:02.603 --> 03:04.638
They became estranged

03:04.671 --> 03:06.239
and remained so.

03:06.272 --> 03:07.708
To your knowledge,

03:07.741 --> 03:10.511
what was Derek's relationship
with the defendant?

03:10.544 --> 03:13.079
That had also deteriorated.

03:13.113 --> 03:16.016
Nancy became Kevin's
primary caregiver.

03:16.049 --> 03:17.350
And as you can imagine,

03:17.383 --> 03:20.053
it's been extremely burdensome.

03:20.086 --> 03:22.322
There were insurance problems,

03:22.355 --> 03:24.090
money issues,

03:24.124 --> 03:25.425
and Nancy couldn't understand

03:25.458 --> 03:27.894
why Kevin's own brother
wouldn't help out.

03:27.928 --> 03:29.395
Well, you say money issues.

03:29.429 --> 03:30.631
Actually,

03:30.664 --> 03:33.433
the financial situation
was desperate, wasn't it?

03:33.466 --> 03:35.401
The problem with insurance,

03:35.435 --> 03:37.704
there's a lifetime cap.

03:37.738 --> 03:41.007
In this case, $750,000.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.544
They exhausted that
in three years.

03:43.577 --> 03:45.546
Basically, Derek was well-off

03:45.579 --> 03:47.514
but wouldn't help
with his brother's care?

03:47.548 --> 03:48.515
Yes.

03:48.549 --> 03:49.516
And this, in fact,

03:49.550 --> 03:51.417
enraged the defendant,
didn't it?

03:51.451 --> 03:53.053
Objection leading.

03:53.086 --> 03:54.454
WALSH: Withdrawn.

03:54.487 --> 03:56.222
Did you have an opportunity

03:56.256 --> 03:57.858
to witness an argument

03:57.891 --> 04:00.601
between Nancy Healy
and the victim

04:00.634 --> 04:02.435
the day before his death?

04:02.468 --> 04:03.436
Yes.

04:03.469 --> 04:05.105
What did you observe, ma'am?

04:05.138 --> 04:08.141
Well, I was visiting Derek
and she came over.

04:08.174 --> 04:09.409
They got into it again.

04:09.442 --> 04:12.513
WALSH: Did you hear
the defendant make any threats?

04:12.546 --> 04:13.413
Yes.

04:13.446 --> 04:15.181
It escalated to a point

04:15.215 --> 04:17.983
where Derek said something like,

04:18.017 --> 04:21.120
"Gee, if he's so bad off,

04:21.154 --> 04:24.324
maybe he should be
put out of his misery."

04:24.357 --> 04:26.426
And Nancy responded,

04:26.459 --> 04:27.628
"No, Derek,

04:27.661 --> 04:30.931
somebody should put you
out of your misery."

04:30.964 --> 04:32.966
And then she said,

04:32.999 --> 04:35.101
"Maybe that's the solution."

04:36.603 --> 04:38.404
FRUTT: When Nancy said this,

04:38.437 --> 04:40.874
did you believe
she was forming the intent

04:40.907 --> 04:41.842
to kill Derek?

04:41.875 --> 04:43.644
Obviously not.

04:43.677 --> 04:45.411
And when you talked
to the police,

04:45.445 --> 04:47.280
you described
Nancy's psychological

04:47.313 --> 04:48.982
state of mind,
didn't you?

04:49.015 --> 04:49.983
Yes.

04:50.016 --> 04:51.184
FRUTT: Could you please
tell the jury

04:51.217 --> 04:52.953
what you told the police?

04:52.986 --> 04:54.287
For several months

04:54.320 --> 04:56.356
preceding the killing,

04:56.389 --> 04:59.292
she seem to be
increasingly erratic.

04:59.325 --> 05:01.134
The insurance thing,

05:01.167 --> 05:02.936
she felt very deceived.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.671
It made her incense.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.172
And erratic?

05:06.206 --> 05:07.841
Yes.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.409
In my opinion, she was having

05:09.442 --> 05:11.712
some kind of nervous breakdown.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.017
What do you mean
you can't get hired?

05:17.050 --> 05:18.118
I can't.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.320
Andrea, you made law review.

05:20.353 --> 05:21.487
You clerked.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.624
What, you have a criminal record
or something?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.159
Close.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.563
When I was 14,

05:30.831 --> 05:31.998
I was raped.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.535
It comes up in my interviews

05:34.568 --> 05:37.638
and my prospects
hit the floor with a thud.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.606
It comes up
in your interviews?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.341
How many have you had?

05:41.374 --> 05:43.577
Including callbacks,
over 30.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.911
And it always comes up?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.379
Pretty much.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.282
I took some time off
for treatment,

05:49.315 --> 05:51.785
so the little gap
in my resume,

05:51.818 --> 05:52.719
I explain it.

05:54.921 --> 05:56.923
Do you think it's wise
to bring it up?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.760
I mean, law firms
aren't exactly looking

05:59.793 --> 06:01.568
to hire rape victims.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.336
This is what I'm assuming.

06:07.473 --> 06:08.174
Who would you sue?

06:08.208 --> 06:09.309
The law firms.

06:09.342 --> 06:10.911
She already has sued and--

06:10.944 --> 06:12.045
All 30 of them?

06:12.078 --> 06:14.280
STRINGER: Yes.
She's claiming industry bias.

06:14.314 --> 06:15.348
Against rape victims?

06:15.381 --> 06:17.383
Here's the complaint
and supporting memoranda.

06:17.417 --> 06:18.819
It's pretty good.

06:18.852 --> 06:21.421
Thing is, they brought a motion
to dismiss yesterday

06:21.454 --> 06:23.123
and now,
there's an evidentiary hearing--

06:23.156 --> 06:24.958
Slow down.

06:27.961 --> 06:29.930
Andrea has to testify,

06:29.963 --> 06:31.665
so she basically needs
co-counsel.

06:31.698 --> 06:33.366
That's why she asked
for our help.

06:33.399 --> 06:34.968
Well, have any of these firms

06:35.001 --> 06:36.937
said that her status
as a rape victim

06:36.970 --> 06:38.138
was why they didn't hire her?

06:38.171 --> 06:41.041
Of course not.
But zero for thirty?

06:41.074 --> 06:42.275
Come on.
Jamie!

06:42.308 --> 06:44.044
It's a solid test case,
Eugene.

06:44.077 --> 06:45.912
What, rape victims
as a class?

06:45.946 --> 06:47.447
I know it's tough

06:48.549 --> 06:49.616
which means...

06:50.684 --> 06:51.818
it would be a lot of help

06:51.852 --> 06:54.955
if there were a senior litigator
there with me.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.957
They might be more inclined
to settle.

06:58.491 --> 06:59.526
Please?

07:01.868 --> 07:02.903
(sighs)

07:02.936 --> 07:04.738
It's you.

07:04.771 --> 07:05.739
Me?

07:05.772 --> 07:06.807
The problems,

07:06.840 --> 07:08.274
as you describe them,

07:08.308 --> 07:11.244
it all goes
by your own admission

07:11.277 --> 07:13.313
to your, uh...

07:13.346 --> 07:15.649
inability to share your life,

07:15.682 --> 07:18.084
your unwillingness to.

07:18.118 --> 07:20.521
I didn't exactly
say that, doctor.

07:20.554 --> 07:22.488
Yes, you did.

07:22.523 --> 07:24.490
Look, here's the deal.

07:24.525 --> 07:26.593
You like being alone.

07:26.627 --> 07:27.894
She doesn't.

07:27.928 --> 07:30.163
So what do we do about it?

07:30.196 --> 07:31.397
Well, we go to work on it

07:31.431 --> 07:33.967
that is, if you want to.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.502
Of course I do.

07:35.536 --> 07:38.304
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

07:38.338 --> 07:39.773
You're here
because your marriage

07:39.806 --> 07:41.508
feels like it's failing.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.910
You're here because,
for the sake of your son,

07:43.944 --> 07:45.512
you wanna repair
the deficits.

07:45.546 --> 07:47.213
But that's different

07:47.247 --> 07:50.283
from actually desiring
a partnership.

07:51.652 --> 07:55.088
From where I sit,
I think you crave isolation.

07:57.357 --> 08:00.266
LORI: She called me
just past 3:00,

08:00.300 --> 08:02.035
asking if I could come over.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.804
The defendant called you?

08:03.837 --> 08:05.506
Which wasn't unusual.

08:06.807 --> 08:09.242
I filled in a lot,
caring for Kevin.

08:09.275 --> 08:11.311
It gave her a chance
to get out of the house.

08:11.344 --> 08:13.313
And lately,
it seemed like she needed it.

08:13.346 --> 08:17.050
So even though your husband
was estranged from his brother,

08:17.083 --> 08:18.051
you weren't?

08:18.084 --> 08:19.485
No.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.188
In fact, it was an issue
between Derek and me.

08:22.222 --> 08:24.658
I thought he should contribute.

08:24.691 --> 08:27.928
The reality is our son
caused the accident

08:27.961 --> 08:29.229
which paralyzed Kevin.

08:30.396 --> 08:31.732
WALSH: Okay.

08:31.765 --> 08:34.366
Going back to the day
Derek was killed,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.001
you got a phone call
from Nancy?

08:36.035 --> 08:37.638
Yes.

08:37.671 --> 08:39.304
She asked
if I could watch Kevin

08:39.339 --> 08:41.274
while she did a few errands.

08:41.307 --> 08:42.509
I agreed.

08:42.543 --> 08:44.344
I went over there around 4:00.

08:44.377 --> 08:46.680
Nancy returned
a little after 6:00.

08:46.713 --> 08:48.782
I then went home,

08:48.815 --> 08:50.350
where I found Derek.

08:50.383 --> 08:53.019
Dead?
Yes.

08:53.053 --> 08:54.788
He was bleeding
from the head.

08:54.821 --> 08:56.289
And you called the police?

08:56.322 --> 08:57.524
Yes.

08:57.558 --> 08:59.626
And what did you say?

08:59.660 --> 09:01.868
That I thought
Nancy killed him.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.907
When Nancy returned home,

09:06.940 --> 09:08.241
how did she appear?

09:08.274 --> 09:10.276
Very disoriented.

09:10.310 --> 09:12.846
And you mentioned that,
lately,

09:12.879 --> 09:16.249
you had actually
been increasing your role

09:16.282 --> 09:17.217
as nurse for Kevin?

09:17.250 --> 09:18.552
LORI: Yes.

09:18.585 --> 09:20.554
I was doing night shift

09:20.587 --> 09:21.622
twice a week.

09:21.655 --> 09:23.724
The last month,
I was there a lot.

09:23.757 --> 09:24.958
Why?

09:24.991 --> 09:27.994
Well, Nancy was becoming
less competent.

09:28.028 --> 09:30.697
She'd forget things.

09:30.731 --> 09:33.499
One time, Kevin was in bed
for almost the whole day

09:33.534 --> 09:34.935
while she slept on the floor.

09:34.968 --> 09:37.237
She'd taken some pills
or something.

09:37.270 --> 09:38.872
BERLUTI: Did you talk to her
about this?

09:38.905 --> 09:40.607
LORI: Yes. I tried to get her

09:40.641 --> 09:42.943
to get help of her own,
counseling,

09:42.976 --> 09:45.979
but she'd just go off
on how she couldn't afford it.

09:46.012 --> 09:49.650
Going back to the day
your husband died,

09:49.683 --> 09:52.452
when you got the call
from Nancy,

09:52.485 --> 09:54.487
asking you to come over,

09:54.521 --> 09:56.690
how did she sound to you?

09:56.723 --> 09:58.024
Not good.

09:58.058 --> 10:00.200
She sounded like
she was going to snap.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.038
Your husband received money

10:05.071 --> 10:06.873
as part of a family trust.

10:06.907 --> 10:07.874
Isn't that right?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.042
Yes.

10:09.075 --> 10:11.344
And upon his death,

10:11.377 --> 10:13.814
that money
would then go to Kevin.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.549
Also correct?

10:15.582 --> 10:16.650
Yes.

10:16.683 --> 10:19.085
Would Nancy Healy
have known this?

10:22.055 --> 10:24.157
Yes, she would.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.238
I don't even think
I called her.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.740
I don't even think
I called her.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.875
Honey, they have
the phone records.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.443
Maybe she wants me convicted.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.745
Anybody think about that?

10:44.778 --> 10:45.912
Lori is your friend.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.313
She's not gonna lie.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.882
Why didn't you
cross her better?

10:48.915 --> 10:50.250
You were mush!

10:53.520 --> 10:54.588
Look...

10:54.621 --> 10:55.889
we need to stay united

10:55.922 --> 10:57.891
and focus on our defense.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.466
Tomorrow's gonna be a long day.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.435
She thinks I'm insane.

11:02.468 --> 11:03.403
Sweetheart...

11:04.671 --> 11:06.607
it's our legal defense.

11:09.375 --> 11:11.411
If I go away,

11:11.444 --> 11:13.079
who takes care of you?

11:14.314 --> 11:16.449
Who takes care of you?

11:18.719 --> 11:21.387
(music playing)

11:30.597 --> 11:31.932
COTE: Overall...

11:31.965 --> 11:34.134
of the 30 initial interviews,

11:34.167 --> 11:37.804
I talked about being raped
all but seven times.

11:37.838 --> 11:40.406
I got seven callbacks.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.408
I'll let you guess
which ones.

11:42.442 --> 11:44.645
Why bring it up at all?

11:44.678 --> 11:47.714
Certainly, rape does not make
for a fun conversation.

11:47.748 --> 11:49.349
No, it doesn't.

11:49.382 --> 11:52.352
The truth is
I never talked about it,

11:52.385 --> 11:54.988
not even to my closest friends.

11:55.021 --> 11:57.991
I always thought that
I could outrun the memory

11:58.024 --> 11:59.025
and that one morning,

11:59.059 --> 12:01.502
I would finally wake up unraped.

12:01.535 --> 12:04.571
But during my clerkship,

12:04.605 --> 12:08.742
I began to suffer
from some emotional problems,

12:08.775 --> 12:09.910
anxiety.

12:11.377 --> 12:13.179
I got therapy
and discovered much of it

12:13.213 --> 12:14.748
was brought on
by my own feelings

12:14.781 --> 12:16.349
of shame and guilt.

12:16.382 --> 12:19.052
So your therapist encouraged
you to talk about it?

12:19.085 --> 12:20.987
Yes.

12:21.021 --> 12:23.690
Unfortunately,
people don't wanna hear it.

12:25.291 --> 12:27.160
During all these interviews,

12:27.193 --> 12:30.230
did anyone make any
inappropriate remark

12:30.263 --> 12:31.464
concerning your being raped?

12:31.497 --> 12:32.599
No.

12:32.633 --> 12:34.200
Do you have any evidence,

12:34.234 --> 12:35.769
testimonial, paper

12:35.802 --> 12:36.903
where you can show,

12:36.937 --> 12:38.171
but for your being raped,

12:38.204 --> 12:40.306
you would have been hired
at a particular firm?

12:40.340 --> 12:42.676
At a particular firm?

12:42.709 --> 12:45.378
No, I have no hard evidence.

12:46.079 --> 12:47.047
Thank you, Andrea.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.148
That's all.

12:48.181 --> 12:49.650
You may step down.

12:51.051 --> 12:54.387
Your Honor, clearly, there's no
prima facie case here.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.690
And even if you could show
a smoking gun,

12:56.723 --> 12:59.693
Massachusetts is an at will
employment state,

12:59.726 --> 13:00.734
which means, legally,

13:00.767 --> 13:01.935
they can hire
whoever they want

13:01.968 --> 13:03.737
without any--
I'd like to call Jason McNeil.

13:04.805 --> 13:05.972
Ms. Stringer...

13:06.006 --> 13:07.273
He's sitting right there.

13:07.307 --> 13:08.408
He's one of the defendants.

13:08.441 --> 13:10.276
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.

13:15.148 --> 13:16.650
We'll take a 20-minute break,

13:16.683 --> 13:18.619
then resume with Mr. McNeil.

13:26.326 --> 13:27.327
Excuse us.

13:31.732 --> 13:33.166
Why did you do that?
I didn't think

13:33.199 --> 13:34.768
Andrea held up too well
in cross,

13:34.801 --> 13:36.637
so I figure, what's to lose?

13:36.670 --> 13:38.371
Maybe the guy
will say something to help us.

13:38.404 --> 13:40.641
Jamie, if you don't know
what a witness will say,

13:40.674 --> 13:41.808
you don't call them.

13:41.842 --> 13:43.610
That's cross-examination 101.

13:43.644 --> 13:45.011
The case
is a long shot, Eugene,

13:45.045 --> 13:45.879
so--
Exactly.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.313
So the last thing we need

13:47.347 --> 13:49.149
is for the defense
to get to button the motion

13:49.182 --> 13:50.250
with their side.

13:50.283 --> 13:51.618
STRINGER: The judge
was about to rule.

13:51.652 --> 13:53.554
YOUNG: This witness isn't
going to admit to anything.

13:53.587 --> 13:54.921
Odds are,
he'll have you for lunch,

13:54.955 --> 13:57.090
and then the judge will rule,
all right.

13:57.123 --> 13:59.425
Jamie, think.

13:59.459 --> 14:00.767
If that fails,

14:00.801 --> 14:02.468
at least check with me.

14:06.573 --> 14:08.775
KEVIN: So she had come home
at about 5:00,

14:08.809 --> 14:10.176
and...

14:10.210 --> 14:13.647
she looked well,
like Lori said, in a daze.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.249
This was when she got back
from your brother's?

14:16.282 --> 14:17.350
KEVIN: Yes.

14:17.383 --> 14:18.985
Then, she lay down
for about an hour.

14:19.019 --> 14:20.453
And then when she woke up,

14:20.486 --> 14:22.723
she said that...

14:22.756 --> 14:25.025
she had no memory of even going
to my brother's house.

14:25.058 --> 14:26.527
Did you believe her?

14:26.560 --> 14:27.761
I did.

14:27.794 --> 14:30.363
Because this sort of thing
had happened before.

14:30.396 --> 14:33.867
She had blackouts
for extended periods of time.

14:33.900 --> 14:35.936
It was brought on
by a syndrome called

14:35.969 --> 14:37.571
caregiver's burnout.

14:37.604 --> 14:39.272
Caregiver's burnout?

14:39.305 --> 14:41.508
It's basically a state
of emotional

14:41.542 --> 14:43.544
and mental exhaustion.

14:43.577 --> 14:46.379
Mrs. Healy demonstrated
many of the symptoms,

14:46.412 --> 14:47.748
inability to sleep,

14:47.781 --> 14:49.750
thoughts of suicide,

14:49.783 --> 14:51.184
feelings of hopelessness.

14:51.217 --> 14:53.854
The syndrome can be
especially pronounced

14:53.887 --> 14:56.690
when the caregiver
is also the spouse.

14:56.723 --> 14:58.224
She had to wash me,

14:58.258 --> 14:59.693
dress me, feed me,

15:00.901 --> 15:02.769
assist me in going
to the bathroom,

15:02.803 --> 15:03.737
and then...

15:05.071 --> 15:07.307
clean me up
after I'd been to the bathroom.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.311
It was full-time,
around the clock.

15:13.113 --> 15:14.114
It became her life.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.783
And the problem is

15:16.817 --> 15:18.451
they start to see themselves

15:18.484 --> 15:20.854
exclusively as caregivers.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.388
Now, when this happens
with patients

15:22.422 --> 15:24.858
whose condition
isn't improving--

15:24.891 --> 15:26.793
She was plunging into depression

15:26.827 --> 15:27.961
and hopelessness.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.132
And some days, she would
just amble around the house,

15:33.299 --> 15:35.435
feeling completely disoriented.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.838
GABLER: Add to that the rage
against the brother

15:37.871 --> 15:39.139
for not helping,

15:39.172 --> 15:42.308
my opinion is,
it triggered a psychotic break.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.612
But wouldn't she at least
remember it?

15:45.646 --> 15:46.446
No.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.413
Because she suffered

15:47.447 --> 15:49.950
from a form
of traumatic amnesia.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.018
What she did
was so shocking,

15:52.052 --> 15:54.154
she basically blocked it out.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.023
WALSH: How can you prove
she's not faking amnesia?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.092
We obviously can't prove it,

15:59.125 --> 16:00.867
but in my professional opinion,

16:00.901 --> 16:03.570
she has no memory
of committing this act.

16:03.604 --> 16:05.806
Yes, well,
in my professional experience,

16:05.839 --> 16:07.440
the killer
usually denies doing it.

16:07.473 --> 16:09.175
And then,
once you catch them, it's,

16:09.209 --> 16:10.777
"Oh, gee, amnesia."

16:10.811 --> 16:11.812
Objection.

16:11.845 --> 16:12.979
WALSH: Withdrawn.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.816
When did this traumatic shock
kick in, doctor?

16:15.849 --> 16:17.884
Probably as soon
as she committed the act

16:17.918 --> 16:19.219
and realized it.

16:19.252 --> 16:20.554
After she had taken the time

16:20.587 --> 16:22.889
to wipe the fire poker
clean of her prints?

16:23.423 --> 16:24.825
Possibly.

16:24.858 --> 16:25.892
I can't say for sure.

16:25.926 --> 16:29.530
And all these symptoms
of burnout you spoke of,

16:29.563 --> 16:31.464
thoughts of suicide,

16:31.497 --> 16:34.535
sleeplessness, hopelessness,

16:34.568 --> 16:37.237
did you actually witness
those symptoms, doctor?

16:37.270 --> 16:39.640
They were corroborated
by her husband.

16:39.673 --> 16:41.307
Yes, her husband.

16:41.341 --> 16:42.943
He had the same
financial motive to kill

16:42.976 --> 16:44.244
as his wife, didn't he?

16:44.277 --> 16:45.612
Objection.
Objection.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.918
That went as well
as we could have hoped.

16:51.952 --> 16:53.854
You held up extremely well,
Kevin.

16:53.887 --> 16:55.789
So what happens now?

16:55.822 --> 16:57.257
You.

16:57.290 --> 16:58.458
You happen.

16:58.491 --> 17:00.767
FRUTT: You just need
to tell your story, Nancy.

17:00.801 --> 17:02.636
Expect for Walsh
to come at you

17:02.669 --> 17:04.637
with everything he's got.

17:04.671 --> 17:06.006
But do not dodge,

17:06.039 --> 17:07.508
do not hide.

17:07.540 --> 17:09.474
Simply tell the truth.

17:09.510 --> 17:11.111
Our main mission here

17:11.144 --> 17:13.479
is to let the jury see you
as a human being.

17:14.748 --> 17:15.816
Okay.

17:15.848 --> 17:18.050
We're doing very well.

17:18.084 --> 17:20.286
We just need to hang in there
a little bit longer.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.358
I remember her mentioning
she'd been raped,

17:26.392 --> 17:28.428
but it certainly didn't factor
into my decision.

17:28.461 --> 17:29.963
Why didn't you hire her?

17:29.996 --> 17:32.098
Counsel,
we see so many applicants,

17:32.132 --> 17:33.767
all with excellent transcripts

17:33.800 --> 17:35.836
from top-rate law schools.

17:35.869 --> 17:37.938
In the end,
many of the final calls

17:37.971 --> 17:39.372
come from the gut.

17:39.405 --> 17:42.676
And your gut said,
"Don't hire Andrea Cote"?

17:42.709 --> 17:44.477
MCNEIL: I didn't form
any negative conclusions

17:44.511 --> 17:45.579
toward her.

17:45.612 --> 17:48.314
I guess I just had more positive
reactions to others.

17:48.348 --> 17:49.750
Because they hadn't
been raped?

17:49.783 --> 17:51.151
Of course not.

17:51.184 --> 17:52.953
She made law review.

17:52.986 --> 17:54.454
She was a finalist
in the New England

17:54.487 --> 17:55.388
Moot Court Competition.

17:55.421 --> 17:56.690
McNEIL: She's very qualified.

17:56.723 --> 17:58.124
But if you look at our hires

17:58.158 --> 17:59.560
over the last year,

17:59.593 --> 18:02.235
you'll see that they, too,
are extremely talented.

18:02.268 --> 18:03.837
STRINGER: Mr. McNeil,

18:03.870 --> 18:07.508
I have no doubt that
you are an honorable man.

18:07.541 --> 18:10.210
Reminding you that
you are under oath,

18:10.243 --> 18:11.878
are you telling this court

18:11.912 --> 18:14.014
that Andrea Cote's status
as a rape victim

18:14.047 --> 18:15.616
didn't inform a little

18:15.649 --> 18:18.218
on your decision
not to hire her?

18:18.251 --> 18:20.654
Ms. Stringer, I indeed like
to think of myself

18:20.687 --> 18:22.556
as an honorable man.

18:22.589 --> 18:23.990
I'm a proud member
of the bar

18:24.024 --> 18:26.126
and an officer of this court.

18:26.159 --> 18:28.829
And I will tell you
categorically,

18:28.862 --> 18:31.865
her status as a rape victim
played no part whatsoever

18:31.898 --> 18:33.466
in my determination.

18:42.943 --> 18:46.479
NANCY: My head would get,
um, I don't know,

18:46.513 --> 18:48.214
loopy sometimes

18:48.248 --> 18:51.151
like I was drugged
or something.

18:51.184 --> 18:54.287
The doctor said
it was from stress.

18:54.320 --> 18:57.558
Sometimes I would get this
incredible fatigue

18:57.591 --> 18:59.760
and I would go to sleep.

19:00.834 --> 19:03.670
And I guess I would wake up,

19:03.704 --> 19:06.740
but I wouldn't wake up
really.

19:06.773 --> 19:09.242
I have no memory of even going

19:09.275 --> 19:11.277
to Derek's house that day.

19:11.311 --> 19:13.780
And this kind of blackout,

19:13.814 --> 19:15.081
had it happened before?

19:15.115 --> 19:16.416
Two other times.

19:16.449 --> 19:19.152
Like half a day
would be a blank.

19:19.185 --> 19:21.622
But your anger
toward the victim,

19:21.655 --> 19:22.856
that you remember?

19:22.889 --> 19:24.591
Definitely.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.792
I think...

19:25.826 --> 19:28.294
he was a vile person.

19:28.328 --> 19:30.363
I'm not defending
my killing him,

19:30.396 --> 19:32.699
but I very much hated him.

19:32.733 --> 19:34.701
I won't pretend otherwise.

19:34.735 --> 19:36.503
Do you remember saying to him

19:36.537 --> 19:38.071
that he should be
put out of his misery?

19:38.104 --> 19:41.174
That was a figure of speech.

19:41.207 --> 19:42.809
I promise you,

19:42.843 --> 19:45.746
I never formed an intent

19:45.779 --> 19:46.713
to kill him

19:46.747 --> 19:48.615
or to become violent.

19:48.649 --> 19:51.151
Whatever happened
in that house...

19:51.184 --> 19:52.018
happened,

19:53.253 --> 19:56.723
but I had to be acting
outside of myself.

19:58.825 --> 20:00.500
If you don't remember,

20:00.534 --> 20:01.968
how can you be sure
you didn't form

20:02.002 --> 20:03.637
a plan that day to kill him?

20:03.670 --> 20:05.972
Because I'm not a murderer,
Mr. Walsh.

20:07.641 --> 20:08.675
Are you a liar?

20:08.709 --> 20:10.310
No.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.812
An honest person?

20:11.845 --> 20:13.213
Yes, I am.

20:13.246 --> 20:14.781
I see.

20:14.815 --> 20:18.652
So the hatred you felt
for your brother-in-law

20:18.685 --> 20:20.654
was because he wouldn't
contribute money

20:20.687 --> 20:22.155
to your husband's care?

20:22.188 --> 20:23.323
That was the main thing,

20:23.356 --> 20:25.559
but he was a bad human being

20:25.592 --> 20:27.393
in many other ways.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.295
So you could never see
yourself loving him,

20:29.329 --> 20:30.296
I guess?

20:32.198 --> 20:34.535
Could you see yourself
making love to him?

20:38.104 --> 20:38.872
You see...

20:40.140 --> 20:42.342
Derek once confided something
to his mother.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.844
I had planned to ask her
on the stand,

20:43.877 --> 20:45.078
but then I thought

20:45.111 --> 20:47.047
how much more exciting
it would be

20:47.080 --> 20:48.214
to ask you.

20:49.983 --> 20:53.253
Did you ever have an affair
with the victim, Mrs. Healy?

20:57.624 --> 20:58.792
Blackout?

20:58.825 --> 21:00.500
No memory of it?

21:01.434 --> 21:05.471
Did you ever have
sexual intercourse

21:05.506 --> 21:07.140
with Derek Healy?

21:09.843 --> 21:11.678
It happened.

21:11.712 --> 21:14.548
WALSH: You just told the jury
you were an honest person.

21:14.581 --> 21:16.983
Is that your idea
of honest behavior

21:17.017 --> 21:18.952
sleeping with your husband's
brother?

21:18.985 --> 21:20.654
Objection!
Did he scorn you?

21:20.687 --> 21:22.122
Your Honor!
Mr. Walsh.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.324
Love or money, money or love,
what was the motive

21:24.357 --> 21:25.358
for murder?
FRUTT: Move to strike.

21:25.391 --> 21:27.327
WILCOX: Mr. Walsh!

21:29.663 --> 21:32.666
(music playing)

21:46.547 --> 21:49.149
FRUTT: Look, technically,

21:49.182 --> 21:50.984
this doesn't affect our defense.

21:52.085 --> 21:54.054
With a psychotic break,

21:54.087 --> 21:55.722
motive isn't in play.

21:57.423 --> 21:58.992
What other--

21:59.025 --> 22:01.868
Let's not kid ourselves.

22:01.902 --> 22:02.803
It matters.

22:07.674 --> 22:09.309
I am so sorry.

22:15.381 --> 22:17.751
It happened three years ago.

22:17.784 --> 22:18.985
I just--

22:21.622 --> 22:24.758
sometimes I would get
so lonely, Kevin.

22:27.961 --> 22:29.295
Well,

22:30.964 --> 22:33.366
I never deluded myself
into thinking that

22:36.302 --> 22:38.338
and I was always afraid
that you'd...

22:40.206 --> 22:42.142
turn to someone else

22:42.175 --> 22:43.844
for what you couldn't get
from me.

22:47.113 --> 22:48.549
To go to him?

23:05.171 --> 23:07.307
Any word?
No.

23:07.340 --> 23:09.309
I persuaded the judge
to let me give a summation,

23:09.342 --> 23:11.612
so we go back in
tomorrow morning.

23:11.645 --> 23:12.879
Summation?

23:12.913 --> 23:14.380
I can't give up on this, Eugene.

23:14.414 --> 23:16.416
Well, how did you
persuade the judge?

23:19.485 --> 23:21.121
Did you go in ex parte?

23:23.023 --> 23:24.357
Yes.

23:24.390 --> 23:26.092
Jamie, you can't do that.
Please don't start with me.

23:26.126 --> 23:27.493
What start?
It's just that you can't do--

23:27.528 --> 23:30.063
I would really appreciate
you not leaning on me right now

23:30.096 --> 23:31.732
and just letting me
finish this closing.

23:31.765 --> 23:32.899
Could you do that?

23:35.468 --> 23:36.803
Are you okay?

23:44.878 --> 23:48.515
(music playing)

23:48.549 --> 23:50.617
MAN: Here you go, sir.

23:50.651 --> 23:52.118
Oh, jeez!
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:52.152 --> 23:54.220
Bobby!
Oh, my God. Sarah?

23:54.254 --> 23:55.288
How are you?

23:55.321 --> 23:56.790
I'm great. You?

23:56.823 --> 23:58.759
Fine, fine.

23:58.792 --> 24:00.133
I thought you left Boston.

24:00.166 --> 24:01.467
Well, I'm back.

24:01.502 --> 24:02.569
D.C. summers were too hot.

24:02.603 --> 24:04.070
I'm at Wickham now,
private practice.

24:04.104 --> 24:05.238
Wickham?
Yes.

24:05.271 --> 24:06.006
Well, that's a good firm.

24:06.039 --> 24:08.074
It is. It is.

24:08.108 --> 24:10.711
Great. Married?

24:10.744 --> 24:12.813
No, no. One day, I hope.

24:12.846 --> 24:15.481
Well, you look...

24:15.516 --> 24:16.517
fabulous.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.819
Thank you.
You do too.

24:18.852 --> 24:21.822
Um, I'm actually running late.

24:21.855 --> 24:23.156
I would love
to catch up sometime.

24:23.189 --> 24:24.558
That'd be great.

24:25.258 --> 24:26.159
Good to see you.

24:26.192 --> 24:27.427
You too.

24:27.460 --> 24:28.428
Yeah.

24:32.365 --> 24:34.267
FRUTT: No prior history

24:34.300 --> 24:36.469
of any violence.

24:36.503 --> 24:38.204
She came home dazed that day

24:38.238 --> 24:41.174
with no memory
of what had happened.

24:41.207 --> 24:43.209
She had had prior blackouts,

24:43.243 --> 24:45.846
and as the medical experts
told you,

24:45.879 --> 24:47.447
she suffered from a syndrome

24:47.480 --> 24:49.683
known as caregiver's burnout.

24:50.851 --> 24:51.985
It broke her.

24:52.653 --> 24:55.121
The daily, overwhelming burden

24:55.155 --> 24:57.658
of having to care
for a quadriplegic

24:57.691 --> 25:00.300
with almost no help, no money,

25:00.333 --> 25:02.903
coupled with a rage
against a man

25:02.936 --> 25:04.470
who refused to help her,

25:04.505 --> 25:06.507
it broke her.

25:07.608 --> 25:09.943
Even Derek Healy's own wife
told you

25:09.976 --> 25:11.311
that when she spoke to Nancy

25:11.344 --> 25:12.646
on the phone that day,

25:12.679 --> 25:15.949
she sounded
like she was going to snap.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.417
Well,

25:17.450 --> 25:18.785
she did snap.

25:19.920 --> 25:22.355
And the trauma
of taking a human life

25:23.489 --> 25:24.891
suppressed her memory.

25:26.259 --> 25:28.595
WALSH: How convenient.

25:28.629 --> 25:30.230
She kills,

25:30.263 --> 25:32.566
forgets she kills,

25:32.599 --> 25:35.435
then lines up
for her inheritance.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.604
Oh, and by the way,

25:37.638 --> 25:39.139
she just happened to have slept

25:39.172 --> 25:42.142
with the guy that she took
the fire poker to.

25:42.175 --> 25:43.209
Come on.

25:43.243 --> 25:45.612
The only person that can support

25:45.646 --> 25:46.947
these memory lapses,

25:46.980 --> 25:48.582
this dazed condition,

25:48.615 --> 25:50.150
is her husband,

25:50.183 --> 25:52.919
the man who also
has a strong motive

25:52.953 --> 25:55.321
to defend his wife,

25:55.355 --> 25:57.924
the man who also profits
from the killing.

25:58.592 --> 26:00.366
Here's what we have.

26:00.400 --> 26:01.535
The defendant

26:01.568 --> 26:03.036
and her ex-lover

26:03.069 --> 26:05.271
argue the day before.

26:05.305 --> 26:06.406
She tells him

26:06.439 --> 26:09.275
he should be put out
of his misery.

26:09.309 --> 26:12.579
She says, "That's the solution."

26:12.613 --> 26:13.814
The next day,

26:13.847 --> 26:15.682
she kills him

26:15.716 --> 26:18.018
knowing she'll inherit.

26:24.357 --> 26:26.960
Exactly, how long
is this summation?

26:26.993 --> 26:29.295
(door closes)

26:29.329 --> 26:30.997
Jamie, it's understandable

26:31.031 --> 26:32.999
for a lawyer to be anxious,

26:33.033 --> 26:35.135
especially a young one,
but this is a motion.

26:35.168 --> 26:37.337
It's not a trial so--
It's a motion to dismiss

26:37.370 --> 26:38.939
and the client is a friend.

26:38.972 --> 26:39.840
And--

26:43.376 --> 26:45.646
I asked before.

26:45.679 --> 26:47.648
I'll ask you again.

26:47.681 --> 26:50.116
Are you okay?

26:50.150 --> 26:51.518
You can talk to me.

26:51.552 --> 26:52.853
It might even help.

26:52.886 --> 26:54.154
I'm fine.

26:54.187 --> 26:55.989
I am anxious, but...

26:57.423 --> 26:58.625
I'm fine.

27:05.572 --> 27:06.773
Okay.

27:15.481 --> 27:17.417
I was date raped once.

27:17.450 --> 27:18.752
Four years ago.

27:18.785 --> 27:20.554
I didn't report it.

27:20.587 --> 27:22.088
I was too afraid of the stigma,

27:22.122 --> 27:24.024
so maybe this case has...

27:26.827 --> 27:27.828
stirred things up a bit.

27:29.362 --> 27:30.330
You didn't report it?

27:30.363 --> 27:32.866
I couldn't even remember
what I said yes to.

27:33.734 --> 27:36.269
So what, he drugged you?

27:36.302 --> 27:37.804
Yes.

27:37.838 --> 27:39.973
So I don't know.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.242
Maybe I'm not being
exactly objective

27:42.275 --> 27:44.845
about this case and if so,

27:44.878 --> 27:46.346
I'm sorry.

27:46.379 --> 27:48.181
Did you go to counseling
for this or--

27:48.214 --> 27:50.183
You're the first person
I've even told.

27:52.252 --> 27:54.721
Don't ask me
why I'm telling you.

27:54.755 --> 27:57.123
Jamie, Lucy works
for rape crisis.

27:57.157 --> 27:59.359
Maybe she can--
I'm past it now, but thank you.

28:00.466 --> 28:01.702
Jamie,

28:01.735 --> 28:03.169
this is something
you need to deal with.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.404
I did deal with it.

28:04.437 --> 28:05.471
I moved on.

28:05.506 --> 28:07.440
Clearly, you haven't.

28:10.644 --> 28:12.813
I need to get to work
on my closing.

28:14.848 --> 28:16.783
I told you this
in confidence, Eugene,

28:16.817 --> 28:18.885
and I'm gonna ask you
to respect it.

28:40.140 --> 28:41.875
FRUTT: There's gonna be some
media floating around.

28:41.908 --> 28:43.510
So why don't you go wait
on that witness room

28:43.544 --> 28:44.611
and we'll find out
what's going on.

28:44.645 --> 28:45.746
Okay.

28:48.281 --> 28:50.183
Ellenor, Jimmy.

28:51.351 --> 28:52.986
How'd you like
my little bombshell?

28:53.854 --> 28:55.856
You're quite pleased
with yourself.

28:55.889 --> 28:57.390
Anyway, we have a verdict.

28:57.423 --> 28:58.324
Excuse me?

28:58.358 --> 28:59.893
11:00 last night.

28:59.926 --> 29:02.202
Jury's coming back
in about an hour.

29:02.235 --> 29:03.837
See you then, I guess.

29:04.638 --> 29:06.272
This isn't good.

29:06.306 --> 29:07.674
No, it isn't.

29:20.821 --> 29:21.722
What's up?

29:24.324 --> 29:25.726
The jury has a verdict.

29:27.293 --> 29:28.895
We'll be called
in about an hour.

29:35.368 --> 29:38.304
(music playing)

29:40.507 --> 29:42.743
(door closes)

29:42.776 --> 29:45.478
BERLUTI:
Look, it means nothing.

29:45.512 --> 29:47.247
They spend so much time
together.

29:48.915 --> 29:51.251
It probably has no relevance
to anything.

29:55.255 --> 29:57.190
BARKER: I still love
the justice department,

29:57.223 --> 29:59.025
but, uh,

29:59.059 --> 30:00.534
I guess I wanna buy
a house one day,

30:00.567 --> 30:02.736
so private practice it was.

30:02.769 --> 30:04.037
Well,

30:04.070 --> 30:05.672
it certainly looks good on you.

30:05.706 --> 30:06.707
Thank you.

30:10.176 --> 30:11.778
Bobby, what's going on?

30:12.579 --> 30:13.479
What do you mean?

30:13.514 --> 30:15.115
Why are we having coffee?

30:16.316 --> 30:17.851
Well, like you said, to...

30:17.884 --> 30:19.452
catch up and--

30:19.485 --> 30:21.555
I see.

30:21.588 --> 30:23.389
Let's catch up then,
how's your marriage?

30:26.760 --> 30:27.961
If you have to think about it,

30:27.994 --> 30:29.062
maybe you shouldn't be
having coffee

30:29.095 --> 30:30.831
with a woman you used
to sleep with.

30:30.864 --> 30:33.099
I didn't mean anything
other than--

30:35.501 --> 30:37.504
I'm very faithful

30:37.538 --> 30:38.872
to my wife.

30:38.905 --> 30:41.374
Uh-huh.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.677
And are you being faithful
to her at this moment?

30:43.710 --> 30:45.211
Yes.

30:46.513 --> 30:48.314
I'm just having coffee,

30:49.883 --> 30:51.918
not with someone
who I used to sleep with,

30:51.952 --> 30:53.186
but...

30:54.721 --> 30:55.656
someone who--

30:55.689 --> 30:57.023
Who what?

30:58.458 --> 31:00.734
Who doesn't seem to mind
my company.

31:03.269 --> 31:04.505
I don't always get that.

31:04.538 --> 31:05.606
Ah.

31:09.175 --> 31:10.376
So I take it your marriage

31:10.410 --> 31:12.646
is important to you.

31:12.679 --> 31:13.914
Very.

31:14.781 --> 31:16.517
Then maybe you should make use
of this free time

31:16.550 --> 31:18.451
and spend it with your wife.

31:23.524 --> 31:26.459
There's no record
of anybody saying anything

31:26.492 --> 31:28.428
or anybody even considering
her status

31:28.461 --> 31:29.563
as a rape victim.

31:29.596 --> 31:30.964
No evidence that it was a factor

31:30.997 --> 31:33.366
in any decision not to hire her.

31:33.399 --> 31:35.802
All we have
is the paper-thin allegation

31:35.836 --> 31:38.238
supported by nothing

31:38.271 --> 31:40.607
that it must have been
because she was raped.

31:40.641 --> 31:42.543
And even if she's right,

31:42.576 --> 31:44.678
even if they could show
she wasn't hired

31:44.711 --> 31:47.480
because she was raped
and they can't,

31:47.514 --> 31:49.716
the law does not recognize
crime victims

31:49.750 --> 31:51.451
as a protected class
for the purpose

31:51.484 --> 31:53.453
of bringing a lawsuit.

31:53.486 --> 31:55.388
Accordingly, Your Honor,
you have no legal choice

31:55.421 --> 31:57.524
but to dismiss this complaint.

32:09.442 --> 32:12.145
Of course there's going to be
no record of it.

32:12.178 --> 32:14.648
No lawyer is ever going
to write down

32:14.681 --> 32:16.082
or say aloud,

32:16.116 --> 32:18.619
"Gee, I really liked her,
but that rape thing."

32:19.953 --> 32:21.722
It's just easier to say,

32:21.755 --> 32:23.123
"I didn't get a good feel."

32:23.156 --> 32:24.424
I agree,

32:24.457 --> 32:26.459
but that's your problem,
counsel.

32:26.492 --> 32:28.128
Interviews are just that

32:28.161 --> 32:29.763
getting a feel for a person.

32:29.796 --> 32:31.364
They're not scientific.

32:31.397 --> 32:33.499
And prospective employers
can reject a candidate

32:33.534 --> 32:34.668
for a whole host of reasons.

32:34.701 --> 32:37.103
But being raped
is not one of them.

32:37.137 --> 32:38.572
Says who?

32:38.605 --> 32:39.940
As Mr. Hall points out,

32:39.973 --> 32:41.575
there's no special protection

32:41.608 --> 32:42.843
for crime victims.

32:42.876 --> 32:45.445
But if she was perceived
as being sexually damaged--

32:45.478 --> 32:46.446
Where's the showing of that?

32:46.479 --> 32:47.681
If allowed to conduct discovery,

32:47.714 --> 32:48.782
I could make a showing.

32:48.815 --> 32:50.383
Ms. Stringer,

32:50.416 --> 32:53.153
it's tough enough
to fire a person in this country

32:53.186 --> 32:55.388
without being subjected
to a lawsuit.

32:55.421 --> 32:56.957
Now, you're asking me to create

32:56.990 --> 32:59.125
a brand new cause of action

32:59.159 --> 33:00.867
for those people
not even hired yet.

33:00.901 --> 33:02.869
And it's hard enough
to be raped

33:02.903 --> 33:05.572
without then having to endure
a stigma.

33:06.306 --> 33:09.375
Rape victims
are still perceived of as angry,

33:09.409 --> 33:11.344
damaged, less than.

33:11.377 --> 33:14.114
As a result,
women are encouraged by society

33:14.147 --> 33:16.583
to keep it to themselves,
and for God sakes,

33:16.617 --> 33:18.552
don't talk about it.

33:18.585 --> 33:21.187
Andrea Cote is a rape survivor.

33:21.888 --> 33:23.724
And one of the ways
she's survived

33:23.757 --> 33:25.626
is by talking about it.

33:25.659 --> 33:28.394
She shouldn't have to stay
in a closet.

33:28.428 --> 33:30.263
A woman is forcibly raped

33:30.296 --> 33:32.398
every six minutes
in this country.

33:32.432 --> 33:33.700
Let me say it again.

33:33.734 --> 33:35.969
Every six minutes.

33:36.002 --> 33:36.870
You're getting off track.

33:36.903 --> 33:38.404
No, I'm not!

33:38.438 --> 33:39.172
Jamie.

33:45.779 --> 33:49.115
There are a lot
of rape survivors out there.

33:49.149 --> 33:50.951
They're beginning
to constitute

33:50.984 --> 33:53.554
a significant portion
of our society,

33:53.587 --> 33:54.821
and...

33:59.826 --> 34:02.202
we're out there.

34:05.138 --> 34:06.540
We're all around you.

34:08.641 --> 34:10.511
But we stay quiet

34:10.543 --> 34:13.279
and things stay a secret

34:13.313 --> 34:16.516
because there's
an implied pressure, uh...

34:18.918 --> 34:20.485
don't talk about it.

34:20.521 --> 34:21.688
Well,

34:24.123 --> 34:26.326
we're out there.

34:26.359 --> 34:27.860
You seem
to be getting emotional,

34:31.063 --> 34:32.933
if you can make
a legal argument...

34:36.436 --> 34:37.771
My legal argument

34:37.804 --> 34:40.306
would be public policy.

34:40.340 --> 34:42.943
This country spends
millions of tax dollars

34:42.976 --> 34:44.844
on rape prevention,

34:44.878 --> 34:47.813
medical facilities,
rape crisis units.

34:47.848 --> 34:49.983
We pass rape shield laws.

34:50.016 --> 34:52.786
We have rape victims' funds.

34:52.819 --> 34:55.621
We have a public policy

34:55.656 --> 34:57.558
to integrate rape survivors

34:57.591 --> 34:58.959
into society

34:58.992 --> 35:00.500
to make them whole.

35:02.569 --> 35:05.438
Not hiring someone
because she was raped

35:05.471 --> 35:08.074
violates that public policy,

35:08.108 --> 35:09.342
and accordingly,

35:09.375 --> 35:11.044
affords my client

35:11.077 --> 35:13.046
a cause of action.

35:24.457 --> 35:27.393
(music playing)

35:36.770 --> 35:38.304
Two things,

35:38.338 --> 35:39.640
first,

35:39.673 --> 35:41.675
you argued an excellent case.

35:41.708 --> 35:43.243
Your legal analysis was strong.

35:43.276 --> 35:44.811
Who knows,

35:44.845 --> 35:47.113
you may even get the judge
to recognize rape victims

35:47.147 --> 35:48.381
as a status class.

35:51.317 --> 35:52.452
Second,

35:56.289 --> 35:58.959
Jamie,

35:58.992 --> 36:00.601
you need to recognize yourself

36:00.634 --> 36:02.803
as a rape victim.

36:02.836 --> 36:04.705
Like the judge said,
your emotion

36:04.738 --> 36:06.507
was all over that room.

36:06.540 --> 36:08.208
This thing--

36:10.376 --> 36:11.578
talk to Lucy.

36:21.922 --> 36:23.690
(door opens)

36:23.724 --> 36:25.125
KEVIN: Time to go?

36:25.158 --> 36:26.760
No. We still have a few minutes.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.100
I figured it out.

36:35.802 --> 36:36.970
Nancy,

36:37.003 --> 36:39.239
her feeling of being drugged.

36:39.272 --> 36:41.107
She was drugged.

36:41.141 --> 36:43.176
She slept through the day.

36:43.209 --> 36:45.411
You made the phone call to Lori.

36:45.445 --> 36:47.681
Lori drove over,
drove Nancy's car back,

36:47.714 --> 36:49.616
pulled into the garage.

36:49.650 --> 36:51.618
She kills her husband,

36:51.652 --> 36:53.353
dabs Nancy's shoe in the blood,

36:53.386 --> 36:55.121
and drives back.

36:55.155 --> 36:58.124
Nancy wakes, has no memory
of what happened.

36:58.158 --> 36:59.926
You tell her
she's been out somewhere.

36:59.960 --> 37:02.569
Nancy eventually believes it

37:02.602 --> 37:04.403
because she knows
she's had blackouts before

37:04.437 --> 37:05.739
on other occasions

37:05.772 --> 37:07.507
where you've drugged her.

37:07.541 --> 37:08.875
And when Nancy made the threat

37:08.908 --> 37:11.244
about putting him
out of his misery,

37:11.277 --> 37:13.780
the timing was perfect.

37:13.813 --> 37:15.281
Do it the next day.

37:19.219 --> 37:21.855
And how would you propose
that I drugged her

37:21.888 --> 37:24.357
when I can't even move my hands?

37:24.390 --> 37:26.760
Sedatives on my lips?

37:26.793 --> 37:28.829
Lori took care of that
when she made the coffee

37:28.862 --> 37:31.097
the night before.

37:31.131 --> 37:32.432
Well,

37:32.465 --> 37:35.669
if this fantastic tale
were true,

37:35.702 --> 37:38.104
why would I then participate
in my wife's defense

37:38.138 --> 37:39.673
and...

37:39.706 --> 37:41.508
testify on her behalf at trial?

37:41.542 --> 37:43.544
Because either you felt a need

37:43.577 --> 37:45.145
to play your part
to the fullest

37:45.178 --> 37:47.247
or you really don't want

37:47.280 --> 37:49.182
Nancy in jail.

37:49.215 --> 37:51.117
The only goal
was to kill your brother

37:51.151 --> 37:52.586
and get away with it.

37:55.956 --> 37:57.490
You make me sound villainous.

37:59.926 --> 38:02.202
Wheelchair-bound people
are victims.

38:03.804 --> 38:04.871
We're weak.

38:04.905 --> 38:06.072
You know that.

38:08.174 --> 38:10.777
FRUTT: Here's the problem,
Kevin.

38:10.811 --> 38:12.813
If Nancy gets convicted,

38:12.846 --> 38:15.215
which is a real possibility,

38:15.248 --> 38:16.583
she's going away for life,

38:16.617 --> 38:19.119
and I won't be able to undo it.

38:19.152 --> 38:20.754
So the question is,

38:20.787 --> 38:23.990
"How villainous are you?"

38:24.024 --> 38:26.760
Gonna let your wife
go away, Kevin,

38:26.793 --> 38:28.795
after all she's done for you?

38:28.829 --> 38:31.264
All she's done?

38:31.297 --> 38:32.432
She cheated on me.

38:35.235 --> 38:38.204
Anyway, she's not going
to go away

38:39.540 --> 38:42.342
because you're a wonderful
attorney, Ellenor,

38:43.476 --> 38:45.546
and you've just tried
a splendid case.

38:47.614 --> 38:49.182
Don't sell yourself short.

38:49.215 --> 38:51.484
(knocks on door)
(door opens)

38:52.185 --> 38:53.286
The jury's coming in.

38:55.956 --> 38:58.892
(music playing)

39:13.980 --> 39:15.281
Madam foreperson,

39:15.315 --> 39:16.783
the jury has reached a verdict?

39:16.817 --> 39:18.184
We have, Your Honor.

39:18.218 --> 39:19.786
Will the defendant please rise?

39:22.188 --> 39:23.423
What say you?

39:23.456 --> 39:26.426
In the matter of the
Commonwealth versus Nancy Healy

39:26.459 --> 39:27.761
on the charge of murder

39:27.794 --> 39:29.563
in the second degree,

39:29.596 --> 39:31.164
we find the defendant,

39:31.197 --> 39:32.766
Nancy Healy,

39:32.799 --> 39:34.234
guilty.

39:34.267 --> 39:35.301
WILCOX: The jury is dismissed

39:35.335 --> 39:36.737
with the thanks of the court.

39:36.770 --> 39:37.771
We're adjourned.

39:37.804 --> 39:39.139
(gavel bangs)

39:44.645 --> 39:46.346
FRUTT: I'm sorry.

39:46.379 --> 39:49.082
We'll start pursuing appeals.

39:49.115 --> 39:50.316
NANCY: Okay.

39:50.350 --> 39:53.119
KEVIN: I'm so sorry, honey.

39:53.153 --> 39:55.288
Who's gonna take care of you?

39:55.321 --> 39:56.923
I'll be okay.

39:58.959 --> 40:00.366
OFFICER: This way, ma'am.

40:05.639 --> 40:07.207
FRUTT: Nancy is my client.

40:08.474 --> 40:10.511
I can go to the police
with my theory.

40:10.544 --> 40:11.978
Please do.

40:12.012 --> 40:14.347
I'm sure they'll be
as entertained by it as I was.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.690
(music playing)

40:38.071 --> 40:39.139
Where is everyone?

40:40.206 --> 40:41.207
Lunch.

40:42.408 --> 40:44.711
Well, then I guess I'll go eat.

40:44.745 --> 40:46.112
You want me
to pick you up something?

40:46.146 --> 40:47.413
No, thanks.

40:49.015 --> 40:50.350
Want to...

40:51.685 --> 40:52.819
go to lunch?

40:52.853 --> 40:55.656
Uh, I would love to,

40:55.689 --> 40:57.123
but if someone isn't here
to watch the phones,

40:57.157 --> 40:59.092
Eugene gives birth.

41:00.093 --> 41:01.101
Okay.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.245
Lucy, could I talk to you
for a second?

41:13.379 --> 41:14.615
Yeah, sure.

41:23.156 --> 41:24.891
Well, uh--

41:24.925 --> 41:26.426
(telephone rings)

41:26.459 --> 41:28.194
Uh, one second.

41:29.162 --> 41:30.096
Donnell, Young, and Frutt.

41:32.999 --> 41:35.602
Uh-huh.

41:35.636 --> 41:37.237
Thank you.

41:38.404 --> 41:40.340
That was the clerk's office.

41:41.141 --> 41:42.375
You won your motion.

41:42.909 --> 41:43.777
What?

41:43.810 --> 41:46.212
Motion to dismiss was denied.

41:49.382 --> 41:51.818
Oh, wow.

41:51.852 --> 41:54.788
Congratulations.

41:54.821 --> 41:56.056
What did you wanna talk about?

41:58.058 --> 41:59.893
Well, I--

42:03.504 --> 42:04.671
it--

42:07.608 --> 42:08.709
Are you okay?

42:12.813 --> 42:13.847
What's wrong?

42:15.649 --> 42:17.050
Um...

42:20.286 --> 42:21.487
nothing.

42:23.824 --> 42:25.025
It was a...

42:28.194 --> 42:29.362
big case.

42:47.380 --> 42:52.018
(music playing)

43:13.780 --> 43:14.781
WOMAN: You stinker!

43:14.881 --> 43:17.584
(music playing)
