00:03.871 --> 00:04.772
- Welcome.
- To.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.906
- A new.
- Episode.

00:05.973 --> 00:06.840
- Of..
- Childrens Hospital.

00:06.907 --> 00:07.708
- Nothing.
- To.

00:07.775 --> 00:08.509
- Set.
- Up.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.310
- This.
- Week.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.511
- Because.
- This is.

00:10.578 --> 00:11.379
- A.
- Stand.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.646
- Alone.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.048

- Oh!

00:14.115 --> 00:16.317
[theme music]

00:17.585 --> 00:19.320
(female narrator)
Rules.

00:19.387 --> 00:21.789
Rules are the boundaries
between order and chaos.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.124
But as the saying goes

00:23.191 --> 00:24.692
"Rules are meant
to be broken".

00:24.758 --> 00:26.827
For instance,
"Don't poop where you eat".

00:26.894 --> 00:29.363
Shouldn't you be able
to poop wherever you want?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.232
Paperwork can suck
my big, black--

00:31.299 --> 00:33.067
Richard Gere
is in a new movie.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.535
It's called,
My Big Black ****.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.470
- Ah.
- This came for you, Dr. Spratt.

00:36.537 --> 00:39.773
I'm not waiting on any organs.
Are you sure it's for me?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.409
Yup, "Deliver to Lola Spratt".

00:41.475 --> 00:43.211
- Ah, thanks, Dori.
- No problem.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.545
Hey, Glenn,
nice haircut.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.381
Did the band Fall Out Boy
throw up on your head?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.217
'Oh, wait, wait.
Fall Out Boy called'

00:49.283 --> 00:51.185
and they want
their haircut back.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.586
[laughing]
Nailed it.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.422
(male on loudspeaker)
'Attention.'

00:54.488 --> 00:56.857
'Will the owner of
the red jeep with a spoiler'

00:56.924 --> 01:00.428
'and 18 inch rims,
please stop lying to himself?'

01:00.494 --> 01:02.363
- Hey, Glenn.
- Oh, hey.

01:02.430 --> 01:03.431
- Nice hair.
- Thank you.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.266
Fall Out Boy
is my favorite band.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.468
I think I remember
you mentioning that, yesterday

01:07.535 --> 01:09.937
right before I went
to the hair saloon. Weird.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.240
What is with the
big beige scrubs?

01:12.306 --> 01:14.675
Oh, I only wear these
when my regular ones

01:14.742 --> 01:15.709
are at the cleaners.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.977
These were my fat scrubs.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.746
- You were fat?
- Hmmm.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.614
But you're so smart.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.250
- That's me two years ago.
- Wow.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.485
- I know.
- It doesn't even look like you.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.188
- Tell me about it.
- Wow.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.158
- You're way sexier, now.
- Oh.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.426
[both laughing]

01:35.163 --> 01:37.498
Well...guess I'll..

01:37.565 --> 01:39.133
I'll see you later,
alligator.

01:40.568 --> 01:43.571
Not if I "see you later,
alligator" first, crocodile.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.007
Enjoying the coffee?

01:47.074 --> 01:49.443
Oh. You're the best, Sy.
Thanks.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.312
I'm so happy
you're bouncing by.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.046
Hey, sexy,
give me some sugar.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.250
(male #1)
'Love that coffee machine, Sy.'

01:56.317 --> 01:58.486
Oh, my God. You do that,
I can't breathe.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.254
I just got a call
from corporate.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.556
I've to rip $3,000
right outta the budget.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.992
I have to get rid
of the coffee maker.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.160
- Sy.
- Great coffee, Sy.

02:06.227 --> 02:07.495
People finally started
liking you

02:07.561 --> 02:08.961
when you got
that coffee maker.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.999
No, no. If you've to save
some money, fire a doctor.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.501
- A doctor? Who?
- Who cares?

02:13.567 --> 02:16.570
No, no, no. I'll just keep watch
and watch carefully

02:16.637 --> 02:19.173
'which doctor
is least good at her job.'

02:19.240 --> 02:20.941
Hey, have you seen
Glenn's haircut?

02:21.008 --> 02:23.444
Knock, knock. Who's there?
Glenn's haircut.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.080
Glenn's haircut who?
Fall Out Boy, that's who.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.251
- Nailed it.
- I love Fall Out Boy.

02:30.318 --> 02:33.020
Oh, my God.
He did it to impress you.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.688
- 'He likes you.'
- You think?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.724
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.659
- What is that?
- Oh, I don't know.

02:38.726 --> 02:41.562
I think, I'm supposed
to put it into someone.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.997
[Lola impersonating a monster]

02:44.064 --> 02:46.767
Well, see you later,
alligator.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.337
You're an alligator.

02:49.403 --> 02:52.506
You looked at your coffee
and then you looked at Lola.

02:52.573 --> 02:56.644
'You wanna fire Lola, so you
can keep the coffee machine.'

02:58.479 --> 03:00.781
There you are. I'm not gonna
beat around the brisket.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.717
What do you say, you and me
get a drink sometime?

03:03.784 --> 03:05.753
- Like, on a date?
- Yeah. On a date.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.589
- Unless you don't date Jews.
- Oh, I date cool Jews.

03:08.656 --> 03:09.790
[both laughing]

03:09.857 --> 03:11.859
Somebody call my name?

03:11.925 --> 03:13.361
(Glenn)
'Jewy McJewjew.'

03:13.427 --> 03:15.263
Glenn, that's so rude.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.498
It's Rabbi Jewy McJewjew
now, Glenn.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.066
You guys know each other?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.868
Glenn Richie, my old
Hebrew school pal.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.572
He used to steal my girlfriends
and leave them broken hearted.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.675
- I have no idea what you mean.
- What are you doing here?

03:27.741 --> 03:32.212
- I'm the new hospital chaplain.
- I love Charlie Chaplin.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.548
It's a...little different
than that.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.984
Well, it was really nice
meeting you Rabbi McJewjew.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.653
- I'll see you around.
- See you around, alligator.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.492
Hey, you stay away
from her, Jewy.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.094
Look, Glenn, what's past
is past, but I've fallen hard

03:47.160 --> 03:50.931
for this girl. I'm not gonna let
her go because you like her too.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.767
It's not personal.
Now tell me, who cut your hair?

03:53.834 --> 03:57.371
Was it Pete Wentz,
the lead singer of Fall Out Boy?

03:57.438 --> 03:59.273
Nailed it.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.513
(male #2)
'You're guilty..'

04:05.579 --> 04:09.817
'...of having the best damn
coffee within a 10 mile radius''

04:09.883 --> 04:11.885
Detective Chance Briggs.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.522
You dirty SOB! What's my
old partner doing here?

04:14.588 --> 04:15.956
Well, I just downloaded

04:16.023 --> 04:18.492
this third party coffee app
on my Motorola clamshell.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.128
Tells you where to find
the best bean juice around.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.796
We do have fantastic coffee.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.566
Hey, when's the last time
you had your prostate checked?

04:25.633 --> 04:28.001
I don't have time
for that kind of thing.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.670
Do you have time for cancer?

04:29.737 --> 04:30.804
- Get in here.
- No.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.740
- You get in here.
- I will.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.375
[both laughing]

04:34.442 --> 04:38.145
(male on recorder)
Attention, notice taken
of something or someone

04:38.211 --> 04:41.449
on regarding of something
as important or significant.

04:41.515 --> 04:42.716
From the Latin..

04:42.783 --> 04:43.751
(Sy)
'Rabbi?'

04:43.817 --> 04:46.219
Oh. Sy, hello.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.688
What's on your mind?

04:47.755 --> 04:50.358
- You look troubled.
- I really need to talk to you.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.393
Yeah. I'm listening, Sy.
You talk.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.396
I can't decide between
getting rid of Lola

04:55.463 --> 04:57.230
and getting rid of
the coffee maker.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.433
Well, you know,
in Talmudic times

04:59.500 --> 05:02.202
Rabbi Hillel was faced
with a similar dilemma.

05:02.269 --> 05:04.538
And in his infinite wisdom,
he decided

05:04.605 --> 05:07.975
to put a donation cup
next to the coffee machine.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.811
Within a few months, the coffee
machine had paid for itself.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.913
Well, it-it's not
that simple, Rabbi.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.248
If I charge them,
they're gonna hate me.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.884
I just got them
to like me.

05:16.950 --> 05:19.353
- I want them to like me.
- Yeah.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.055
When I was younger,
my-my father was in the Army

05:22.122 --> 05:24.958
and I had to go
to a German elementary school.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.496
[speaking in foreign language]

05:44.612 --> 05:46.580
(Sy)
'And since that time,
I can't decide'

05:46.647 --> 05:49.249
between what's right
and being liked.

05:49.316 --> 05:52.553
Well, yeah, I can see that
with the soldiers taking the kid

05:52.620 --> 05:54.588
and all that business
and, yeah.

05:54.655 --> 05:58.291
Okay, Sy, let's circle back with
you on that a little bit later

05:58.358 --> 06:00.394
and we'll get that
worked out for you.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.130
- Will you think about it?
- Sure, we'll..

06:03.196 --> 06:04.632
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.501
So...the prettiest shiksa
in all of Brazil.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.337
I'm sure you say
that to all the goyishe.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.840
Right. So what can
I do for you, Valerie?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.742
I need you to hear
my confession.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.344
Yes. That is definitely
something a rabbi can do.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.312
Why don't you
sit here with me

06:19.379 --> 06:20.714
and I'll receive
your confession.

06:20.781 --> 06:24.051
Forgive me rabbi,
for I have sinned.

06:24.117 --> 06:26.153
See, I have this...friend.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.857
Okay, let's stop there, Valerie,
there is no friend, is there?

06:29.923 --> 06:32.059
Let's be honest,
this friend is-is you

06:32.125 --> 06:35.663
and you're talking about
some kind of sexual tension.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.198
- Now wait a second.
- What? Rabbis can't have sex?

06:38.265 --> 06:41.835
On the contrary, rabbis are
forbidden to abstain from sex.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.472
'You know, to procreate
is our duty to the race.'

06:44.538 --> 06:46.039
Then procreate me.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.843
Except for the period of
Chamonesh which is the 12 days

06:49.910 --> 06:55.015
where I am forbidden to
partake in the carnal desires..

06:56.717 --> 07:00.521
However...it does end
at sundown, tonight.

07:00.588 --> 07:04.758
Well, then I guess,
I'll see you later, alligator.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.595
[speaking in foreign language]

07:07.661 --> 07:12.065
Ooh-la-la. I love it when a man
can speak a little French.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.502
- I only have two hours. Sy, Sy.
- Hmm? Hmm?

07:14.568 --> 07:17.337
I need to learn a little French.
Do you know any?

07:17.404 --> 07:19.372
No. But I can teach
you some German.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.542
Fine. Fine.
Any romance language will do.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.611
[speaking in foreign language]

07:26.914 --> 07:31.018
Okay. You are gonna feel a
little bit of pressure here.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.986
[screams]
Okay.

07:33.053 --> 07:36.356
You know, this kinda reminds me
of that drug bust in Queens.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.825
You remember?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.261
- That's cool.
- Okay.

07:41.328 --> 07:44.632
Hey, hey, hey. You two.
You sure you're not cops?

07:44.698 --> 07:47.100
- What are you talking about?
- Are you loco?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.336
We're Puerto Rican gang members
just like you.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.905
Hey, amigo, you wanna
go to Chipotle after this?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.808
How does that
remind you of this?

07:54.875 --> 07:58.145
Oh, it's relevant. I promise.
You just keep remembering.

07:59.680 --> 08:03.216
Okay, if you two
ain't cops..

08:03.283 --> 08:08.956
...then I want you to give him
a prostate exam...right now.

08:09.022 --> 08:13.193
I still don't see how that
proved we weren't cops.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.729
[melodic music]

08:18.899 --> 08:21.201
[speaking in foreign language]

08:25.639 --> 08:28.642
I've gotta figure out
what kind of organ this is.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.344
That's not an organ.
That's a pork shoulder.

08:31.411 --> 08:32.880
Pork shoulder?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.616
Why would someone send me
a pork shoulder? I'm Muslim.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.116
"Deliver to Lola Spratt".

08:37.183 --> 08:39.919
Wait a second.
Turn that label upside down.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.324
'Damn it, McJewjew.'

09:04.444 --> 09:05.979
Glenn.
What are you doing?

09:06.046 --> 09:08.281
(Jewy)
'This is highly
offensive, Glenn.'

09:08.348 --> 09:10.818
As offensive as this, Jewy?

09:10.884 --> 09:15.188
Pork? Rabbis don't eat pork.
Jewy, is this your pork?

09:15.255 --> 09:16.590
Is this your pork, Jewy?

09:16.657 --> 09:19.492
I know it looks...kind of
like it..

09:19.559 --> 09:22.095
Er, uh..
You see..

09:24.264 --> 09:26.566
[melodic music]

09:26.634 --> 09:29.870
(female narrator)
Maybe the rules are there
to protect us after all.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.706
- It's better you found out now.
- It just hurts so bad.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.342
I know. Maybe we can
get that drink now.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.478
Oh, Glenn.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.948
I'm done with Jews.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.385
Besides, we work together.

09:45.452 --> 09:51.224
[thinking]
Oh. "Don't poop where you eat".
It's a metaphor.

09:51.291 --> 09:56.396
* I know what it's like
to be loved by you *

09:56.463 --> 09:58.531
[laughing]
You still got the touch.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.167
- Great to see you, bud.
- You, too.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.402
Hey, by the way,
you do have butt cancer.

10:02.469 --> 10:05.038
If you don't seek treatment,
you're gonna die soon.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.640
Some for you.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.408
Some for you.

10:08.475 --> 10:12.412
Some for you
and something...for you.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.081
You're fired, Dr. Spratt..

10:14.147 --> 10:16.149
...because, I'd rather
be liked than right.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.953
Hey, listen up everybody.
Say goodbye to Mr. Nice Guy.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.622
Say hello to Mr. Coffee.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.925
(female narrator)
So Sy resolved his dilemma.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.694
'A reference
to the product, perfect.'

10:26.760 --> 10:29.897
By firing Lola, he could afford
to keep the coffee machine.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.732
You could say he
bought his popularity

10:31.799 --> 10:33.701
for the small price
of his soul.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.703
I guess, rules
are just suggestions..

10:35.769 --> 10:39.072
...like it's not literally
about pooping where you eat.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.109
Sometimes when you're hungry
and you have to take a dump

10:42.175 --> 10:44.111
you gotta do what you gotta do.

10:44.177 --> 10:45.813
Man, those Puerto Ricans
can cook.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.247
[Tim Reid performing
"Love with you"]

10:47.314 --> 10:51.051
* Everybody's telling us
to stick together *

10:51.118 --> 10:55.388
* Battles being fought
they will all get better *

10:55.455 --> 10:59.459
* Tears on your face
speak a thousand words *

10:59.526 --> 11:03.864
* And I know what it's like
to be the saddest clown *

11:03.931 --> 11:06.967
* When every picture of you
comes tumbling *

11:07.034 --> 11:12.672
(male on loudspeaker)
'Attention, 30 days
in the cooler, Hogan!'

11:12.740 --> 11:15.408
Give him a prostate exam,
and give it to him right now!
