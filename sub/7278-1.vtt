when life as you know it ends.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.437
P.S., I will always love you."

01:55:49.925 --> 01:55:52.325
Have you thought about this?

01:55:53.495 --> 01:55:55.725
About me, I mean?

01:55:57.900 --> 01:55:59.561
Have you?

01:56:02.638 --> 01:56:04.265
Yeah.

01:56:29.965 --> 01:56:32.229
- This isn't gonna work, is it?
- No way, no how!

01:56:32.401 --> 01:56:33.561
- Damn!
- Oh!

[LAUGHING]

01:56:35.804 --> 01:56:37.431
Oh, wow.

01:56:37.839 --> 01:56:40.330
I mean, that was like kissing my sister.

01:56:40.509 --> 01:56:43.171
- I'm so relieved!
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:56:43.345 --> 01:56:46.906
I got this letter and I thought he must have
been feeling self-sacrificing...

01:56:47.082 --> 01:56:50.074
...but he's really full of crap.
If he meant it, he'd give me a sign.

01:56:50.252 --> 01:56:53.483
- I hate signs.
- Then I got your message on the machine.

[SIGHS]

01:57:00.028 --> 01:57:02.758
Weird, bitter friends?

01:57:04.533 --> 01:57:06.296
Forever.

[SIGHS]

01:57:18.413 --> 01:57:20.176
What's wrong, friend?

01:57:20.349 --> 01:57:22.317
It's Gerry.

01:57:24.319 --> 01:57:26.150
It's been a year...

01:57:28.490 --> 01:57:31.357
...and I don't feel him
around me anymore.

01:57:33.362 --> 01:57:35.660
I don't think he's here anymore.

01:57:38.166 --> 01:57:40.361
I think Gerry's gone.

01:57:41.903 --> 01:57:43.530
[WHISPERS]
He's really gone.

01:58:02.791 --> 01:58:05.225
HOLLY:
Dear Gerry, you said you wanted me...

01:58:05.394 --> 01:58:06.827
...to fall in love again...

01:58:06.995 --> 01:58:11.398
...and maybe one day I will,
but there are all kinds of love out there.

01:58:12.601 --> 01:58:14.398
This is my one and only life...

01:58:14.803 --> 01:58:18.261
...and it's a great and terrible
and short and endless thing...

01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:21.238
...and none of us come out of it alive.

01:58:31.086 --> 01:58:35.716
I don't have a plan except
that it's time my mom laughed again.

01:58:35.924 --> 01:58:37.755
She's never seen the world.

01:58:37.926 --> 01:58:43.922
She's never seen Ireland, so I'm
taking her back to where we started.

01:58:50.172 --> 01:58:52.538
Maybe now she'll understand.

01:59:01.083 --> 01:59:02.277
Mom?

01:59:17.866 --> 01:59:19.060
William?

01:59:20.969 --> 01:59:22.163
Hello, you.

01:59:25.474 --> 01:59:26.839
You back for another visit?

01:59:28.176 --> 01:59:29.473
How long?

01:59:30.545 --> 01:59:32.103
I don't know.

01:59:34.416 --> 01:59:36.782
Oh, um... This is my mom, Patricia.

01:59:37.219 --> 01:59:39.084
Hello. This is me father, Patsy.

01:59:43.325 --> 01:59:45.190
You've dropped your sweets, luv.

01:59:45.360 --> 01:59:47.351
Mustn't do that around these parts.

01:59:47.529 --> 01:59:51.124
Pretty woman like you,
a fella could take it the wrong way.

[PATSY LAUGHING]

02:00:09.117 --> 02:00:10.675
So I'll see you around, then?

02:00:11.753 --> 02:00:13.186
Yeah.

02:00:19.994 --> 02:00:23.896
HOLLY: I don't know how you did it,
but you brought me back from the dead.

02:00:24.064 --> 02:00:26.089
I'll write to you again soon.

02:00:26.266 --> 02:00:28.131
P. S...

Guess what.
