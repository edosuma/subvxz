WEBVTT

00:31.200 --> 00:33.200
LEE: What's that about? Tell me.

00:33.267 --> 00:37.767
Because, you know, at the end of the day, you can say something

00:37.834 --> 00:41.133
and then it doesn't mean that you can't ever change your mind.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.701
It's not me that's changing my mind, it's you that's changing your mind.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.701
-You always do. -Fine! But what's wrong with that?

00:45.767 --> 00:49.567
GARETH: Yeah, I feel sorry for Dawn and Lee.

00:49.634 --> 00:52.234
If they have to call off the wedding

00:52.300 --> 00:55.267
then, sure, it'll be upsetting now,

00:55.334 --> 00:58.167
but in the end, it's for the best.

00:58.234 --> 01:00.133
The thing about long-term marriage

01:00.200 --> 01:03.601
is that inevitably, the sex suffers.

01:03.667 --> 01:07.634
You constantly have to find new and erotic ways

01:07.701 --> 01:09.434
of spicing things up in the bedroom.

01:11.067 --> 01:13.267
It's a gift and a training.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.133
And I mean, you can either...

01:15.200 --> 01:17.434
It's like I was already good at it before I was trained in it,

01:17.500 --> 01:21.734
and now I'm trained in it I'm better than the people who were just trained...

01:21.801 --> 01:25.033
DAVID: Today's our staff training.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.400
I do a couple a year.

01:28.467 --> 01:31.701
This is Rowan, our facilitator for the day.

01:31.767 --> 01:34.500
It's good to get in an outsider now and again.

01:34.567 --> 01:37.534
It helps to keep them sort of interested, you know.

01:37.601 --> 01:40.834
And it's what I trained in. I have an MBA from Bradford.

01:40.901 --> 01:44.467
I'm trained in it as well. I could have done this myself.

01:44.534 --> 01:47.267
But let me tell you what today is all about.

01:47.334 --> 01:50.667
-I can do that. -Well, it's my...thing.

01:50.734 --> 01:53.300
It's about customer care, really.

01:53.367 --> 01:56.033
Investment in people, i.e. the staff.

01:56.100 --> 01:59.500
Letting them know that they are our most important commodity.

01:59.567 --> 02:02.534
And if they've got a problem, it's my problem.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.267
Uh...

02:07.901 --> 02:12.000
It's like if you're cleaning a floor and you're up against it,

02:12.067 --> 02:16.767
then come to me and I'll help us clean our floor together.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.634
So...

02:18.701 --> 02:20.667
Not literally.

02:27.734 --> 02:29.400
See you in there.

02:31.801 --> 02:33.734
I'm really sorry.

02:35.534 --> 02:38.701
Things will be okay between you and Lee, you know,

02:38.767 --> 02:42.367
because you and Lee are going to be together and he knows that,

02:42.434 --> 02:45.234
and if he doesn't appreciate that, then he's mad.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.334
And if he... I tell you, if he doesn't appreciate it, I'll marry you. You know?

02:53.334 --> 02:56.200
(IN MONOTONE) Hello. You're through to Keith.

02:56.267 --> 02:59.934
I will be at training all day today.

03:00.000 --> 03:04.500
Please call me or leave a message and I will call you tomorrow.

03:04.567 --> 03:06.300
-You're so lovely. -No, I'm not lovely.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.500
-You are. -No, you are.

03:09.901 --> 03:11.667
-I'm snotty. -You're snotty and lovely.

03:11.734 --> 03:13.601
I'd marry your snot.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.300
-All right? -All right, mate?

03:15.367 --> 03:16.801
-What's going on? -Nothing, it's fine.

03:16.868 --> 03:19.901
You're upset. About Lee, is it?

03:19.968 --> 03:21.767
Hey, don't worry, all right?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.601
'Cause you know Monkey Alan down in the warehouse?

03:23.667 --> 03:26.234
He fancies you even if no one else does. So...

03:28.801 --> 03:30.167
(SNIFFS)

03:36.968 --> 03:39.701
What was that?

03:39.767 --> 03:41.567
Just can't say anything when they're like that, can you?

03:41.634 --> 03:45.567
No. No, you can't. You can't. I was doing okay.

03:45.634 --> 03:48.234
What were you doing with the Monkey Alan business?

03:48.300 --> 03:50.234
Well, he fancies her. I'm just saying.

03:50.300 --> 03:53.167
She didn't need to know that, mate. It's Monkey Alan. Even the name...

03:53.234 --> 03:55.701
I don't know who Monkey Alan is, I'm betting that Monkey Alan...

03:55.767 --> 03:58.500
-He's a little bloke. -I don't need to know.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.601
Go away, please.

04:00.667 --> 04:01.968
Go over there.

04:08.734 --> 04:10.234
My name's Rowan.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.701
And I'm going to be leading us through today's sessions.

04:11.767 --> 04:13.567
Under me. Go on.

04:13.634 --> 04:15.801
Well, as David says, actually has briefed me, says that

04:15.868 --> 04:17.734
a lot of what we're covering I think you'll be familiar with.

04:17.801 --> 04:19.934
But it's not necessarily a bad idea to recap anyway,

04:20.000 --> 04:23.500
and I hope that a few new ideas will be thrown into the pan as well.

04:23.567 --> 04:27.033
We're going to start by watching a video, so a nice and gentle start.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.667
It's a bit cheesy and a bit '80s,

04:28.734 --> 04:33.234
but I think a lot of the ideas are still pretty valid. Okay?

04:33.300 --> 04:35.601
A good idea is a good idea forever.

04:36.701 --> 04:38.100
Yeah. Okay.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.300
Philosophy.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.434
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

04:59.701 --> 05:02.300
Hi.

05:02.367 --> 05:06.634
What's the single most important thing to your business?

05:06.701 --> 05:10.133
-Staff. -That's right. The customer.

05:10.200 --> 05:11.667
Mmm. Come at it from a different angle.

05:11.734 --> 05:15.100
These are your profits for this year.

05:16.601 --> 05:21.400
And this is what you're doing to those profits

05:21.601 --> 05:24.534
if you underestimate the value of customer care.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.801
That's not real money.

05:28.868 --> 05:31.500
-Do you know why? -TIM: 'Cause he'd be mad to burn it.

05:31.567 --> 05:34.701
No. 'Cause it's illegal to destroy or burn anything

05:34.767 --> 05:37.000
containing the Queen's image of the realm...

05:37.067 --> 05:40.534
-Can we just watch the video? -...on it. Yeah. That's true.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.801
Statistics show that if you're treated well as a customer,

05:43.868 --> 05:45.534
you'll tell five people.

05:45.601 --> 05:47.901
If you're treated badly, you'll tell nine.

05:49.634 --> 05:52.434
-So can you set fire to a postage stamp? -No.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.400
In fact, a postage stamp is legal tender.

05:56.467 --> 05:59.801
A bus driver would have to accept that as currency.

05:59.868 --> 06:02.367
-Yeah, that'd happen. -Well, if he doesn't, report him.

06:02.434 --> 06:04.400
Yeah, I'll report him when I'm walking home.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.767
You can get a taxi if you've got enough stamps.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.667
-Or cash them in at a post office. -Shouldn't have to.

06:10.734 --> 06:12.667
Shouldn't have to.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.534
Here's a typical office.

06:15.601 --> 06:18.200
Yeah? Yeah. Awful, isn't it?

06:18.267 --> 06:20.934
Oh, yeah? Oh, really? You know, I said to him...

06:21.000 --> 06:22.934
Excuse me. I am in a hurry.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.100
I'm on the phone. God, aren't some people rude?

06:26.167 --> 06:29.734
I must tell you about George. It all started about a year ago...

06:29.801 --> 06:33.601
Well done. That customer won't be bothering you again.

06:33.667 --> 06:35.400
Ever.

06:35.467 --> 06:37.367
Let's see what should have happened.

06:37.434 --> 06:40.234
Yeah? Yeah. Awful, isn't it?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.234
Oh, yeah? Oh, really? You know and I said to him...

06:43.300 --> 06:46.500
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. I'll be with you in one moment.

06:46.567 --> 06:49.267
Sorry, Jean. I'm going to have to go. I have a customer.

06:49.334 --> 06:53.133
I'll call you back at a more convenient time.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.267
All she had to do was acknowledge the customer's presence

06:56.334 --> 06:58.534
and end her personal call as quickly as possible.

07:02.434 --> 07:05.467
This is what we call the Customer Care Tree.

07:08.067 --> 07:10.734
So, your prescription will be ready on Friday, madam.

07:10.801 --> 07:13.234
Fine. See you Tuesday.

07:15.734 --> 07:18.267
So if you've put together a crack team,

07:18.334 --> 07:21.901
don't let your business get taken hostage by complacency.

07:21.968 --> 07:25.067
Make your motto "Who cares wins".

07:25.133 --> 07:28.100
Hey, I know you. Can I have your autograph?

07:28.167 --> 07:29.701
Of course you can.

07:29.767 --> 07:31.968
Thank you, Mr Noakes.

07:35.067 --> 07:36.901
Very good. Very good.

07:36.968 --> 07:39.734
Okay, then. Right. That's that. What are we going to...

07:39.801 --> 07:41.734
-John Noakes. -Yeah.

07:41.801 --> 07:43.167
They worked together on Blue Peter. That's what the reference was.

07:43.234 --> 07:46.167
-Can I...? -She was short-sighted.

07:46.234 --> 07:50.200
Okay. Right. Well, you've all seen the video.

07:50.267 --> 07:52.701
Now it's time for the dreaded role play.

07:52.767 --> 07:55.033
We'll kick off with your leader, David Brent.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.234
David, if you'd like to come up here. Quick round of applause for David.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.834
-(WEAK APPLAUSE) -No, no, no.

08:00.901 --> 08:02.567
I'm cheating, really. I have done this before.

08:02.634 --> 08:05.434
Oh, good. That should make it a lot easier for us.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.634
-Okay, nice and simple to start with. -Hard as you like.

08:08.701 --> 08:10.801
Well, let's just kick off with something nice and easy, okay?

08:10.868 --> 08:14.901
I want us to play out a scenario that highlights customer care.

08:14.968 --> 08:17.400
-Okay. -All of you have to deal with people...

08:17.467 --> 08:19.434
-All the time. -...and it's always possible

08:19.500 --> 08:21.234
-to improve your people skills. -Yeah.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.234
Right. In this scenario, we'll start with something nice and easy.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.901
I'm going to play... And this will be the wrong way to do it.

08:26.968 --> 08:30.534
I'm gonna play a very bad hotel manager who just doesn't care.

08:30.601 --> 08:32.934
Sorry, if it's a Basil Fawlty-type character,

08:33.000 --> 08:35.868
they'll tell you, maybe I should do it, just for the comedy.

08:35.934 --> 08:38.767
Yeah, well, let me just play it now just to kick things off, okay?

08:38.834 --> 08:40.500
I'll probably bring something to this role anyway, so...

08:40.567 --> 08:42.534
Right. You've got a complaint.

08:42.601 --> 08:45.601
You come and complain and I'll show you the wrong way to handle it.

08:45.667 --> 08:48.667
This will be the wrong way. Right? So, off we go.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.000
-Sorry. What's the complaint? -Just make it up.

08:54.067 --> 08:58.701
Anything. Because there's no right or wrong thing in this scenario.

08:58.767 --> 09:01.000
Then we'll tell you the right thing afterwards, so...

09:01.067 --> 09:02.634
-You complain. -Right.

09:02.701 --> 09:04.667
Okay. Okay.

09:04.734 --> 09:06.801
-I'd like to make a complaint, please. -I don't care.

09:08.434 --> 09:10.234
Well, I am staying in the hotel...

09:10.300 --> 09:11.734
I don't care. It's not my shift.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.334
Well, you're an ambassador for the hotel.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.000
-I don't care. -I think you'll care when I tell you

09:15.067 --> 09:18.434
what the complaint is. I think there's been a rape up there!

09:26.567 --> 09:31.500
I've got his attention. Get their attention. Okay?

09:31.567 --> 09:35.434
-Right. So some interesting points. -Very interesting points.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.500
It's not quite the point I was trying to make.

09:37.567 --> 09:39.100
Different points to be made.

09:39.167 --> 09:41.701
-I'm more interested in customer care. -So am I.

09:41.767 --> 09:43.667
-And the way that we would deal with... -I fazed you.

09:43.734 --> 09:46.934
Maybe, as I thought, I should play the hotel manager 'cause I'm used to that.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.834
I fazed you. But you have a go, see if you can faze me. Okay?

09:50.901 --> 09:54.133
Yeah. Right. Okay. Um...

09:54.200 --> 09:57.534
-Hello. I wish to make a complaint. -Not interested.

09:57.601 --> 09:59.400
-My room is an absolute disgrace. -Don't care.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.033
The bathroom doesn't appear to have been cleaned and...

10:01.100 --> 10:02.667
What room are you in?

10:02.734 --> 10:06.367
-362. -There is no 362 in this hotel.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.801
Sometimes the complaints will be false.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.868
Okay? Good.

10:19.234 --> 10:24.000
Today is really about all of you getting to know and trust each other.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.767
So, before the next exercise,

10:25.834 --> 10:27.601
what I want us to do is just spend a few minutes...

10:27.667 --> 10:29.534
(KNOCKING)

10:29.601 --> 10:32.000
Sorry. Can I have a quick word with Dawn?

10:32.067 --> 10:33.400
Dawn?

10:36.701 --> 10:40.300
What I want us to do is for everyone to tell me their name

10:40.367 --> 10:43.334
and their ultimate dream, their ultimate fantasy in life.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.667
I'll kick things off. My name's Rowan,

10:45.734 --> 10:49.534
and my dream is that I would love to have my own island.

10:49.601 --> 10:51.567
David.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.534
It depends what you mean by ultimate fantasy

10:54.601 --> 10:57.467
because time travel's actually impossible,

10:57.534 --> 10:58.601
so there'd be no point in wasting...

10:58.667 --> 11:00.067
Just interpret it any way you like.

11:00.133 --> 11:03.834
Well, if you're talking about anything that could

11:03.901 --> 11:07.667
or could not be possible, actually,

11:07.734 --> 11:11.500
anything that could be conceived of to happen or not

11:11.567 --> 11:14.934
within my realm, you know,

11:15.000 --> 11:17.834
then probably some sort of everlasting life.

11:17.901 --> 11:20.534
I don't mean it in sort of just a spiritual or religious sense,

11:20.601 --> 11:24.133
but I mean actually to experience the future

11:24.200 --> 11:27.167
and live, you know, on and on

11:27.234 --> 11:31.567
and on, you know, know what it's like to live forever.

11:31.634 --> 11:34.734
I think I'm starting to know what that's like.

11:34.801 --> 11:36.834
-No, I'm saying... -No, hang on.

11:36.901 --> 11:39.300
-You always have your say. -No, I don't always have my say.

11:39.367 --> 11:41.000
When do I have my say?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.701
I've been engaged to Lee for, um,

11:43.767 --> 11:46.267
God, about three years.

11:46.334 --> 11:49.500
He proposed on a Valentine's Day.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.467
Although he didn't do it face to face,

11:51.534 --> 11:55.534
he did it in one of the little Valentine's message bits in the paper.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.567
Um...

11:57.634 --> 12:01.167
I think he had to pay for it by the word because it just said,

12:01.234 --> 12:04.968
"Lee love Dawn. Marriage?"

12:07.033 --> 12:09.767
Which, you know, I like,

12:09.834 --> 12:15.167
'cause it's not often you get something that's both romantic and thrifty.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.634
And don't phone my mum again!

-ROWAN: Uh, Dawn, do you want...? -Don't.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.500
Okay.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.634
Um...

12:23.701 --> 12:28.634
Gareth, a quick trust exercise. Ultimate fantasy?

12:28.701 --> 12:30.868
-Hmm? -We're just doing the ultimate fantasy.

12:30.934 --> 12:33.567
We're all doing it.

12:33.634 --> 12:37.601
Two lesbians, probably. Sisters. I'm just watching.

12:41.601 --> 12:43.801
Okay. Um...

12:43.868 --> 12:45.801
Tim? Do you have one?

12:45.868 --> 12:49.067
I never thought I'd say this, but can I hear more from Gareth, please?

12:54.934 --> 12:59.000
Okay. Well, this next exercise is all about

12:59.067 --> 13:00.634
motivation.

13:00.701 --> 13:03.167
And that's going to be a key word today, motivation.

13:03.234 --> 13:05.834
So... Keith?

13:05.901 --> 13:08.934
What would you say was your motivation for working here?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.968
-Being part of a team, I'd have thought. -Just let him answer.

13:11.033 --> 13:13.534
No, I'm saying. Probably what he'll say if you ask him.

13:13.601 --> 13:16.567
Well, I am asking him and I'd really like him to answer.

13:16.634 --> 13:18.567
-Do you want to answer him? -Thanks.

13:18.634 --> 13:20.601
-This job's just a stop-gap, really. -Wow.

13:20.667 --> 13:24.567
The job's not difficult. I don't take my work home with me.

13:24.634 --> 13:27.000
-It's pretty brainless. -Well, at your level, maybe.

13:27.067 --> 13:31.667
But ultimately, I want to play music, write music and play in a band.

13:31.734 --> 13:34.834
Good luck! Been there, done that, bought the T-shirt. Next!

13:34.901 --> 13:36.133
-Okay, Keith... -DAWN: You were in a band?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.901
-Like a rock band? -Yeah.

13:37.968 --> 13:41.167
-What were you called? -Foregone Conclusion.

13:41.234 --> 13:43.167
Look, David, I'm not absolutely sure this is really the right time...

13:43.234 --> 13:45.901
-Well, I've got to field the questions. -TIM: David.

13:45.968 --> 13:48.934
-What did you do in the group? -Singer-songwriter.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.534
Lyrics man, mainly, but you know, the music came easy as well, so...

13:53.601 --> 13:56.434
Okay. Right. So, are there any more questions for David?

13:56.500 --> 13:58.834
-No? Good. -You didn't give them a chance.

13:58.901 --> 14:02.601
-Did you want to say something? -Were you successful?

14:02.667 --> 14:05.534
Were we successful? I'll let you be the judge of that

14:05.601 --> 14:07.968
when I tell you that we were once supported

14:08.033 --> 14:13.167
by a little-known Scottish outfit called Texas.

14:13.234 --> 14:17.968
Yeah, and I get all this, "Oh, David, you're a brilliant singer-songwriter.

14:18.033 --> 14:23.133
"You're stuck in Slough while it's Texas that are off making all the money.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.000
"And they're rubbish compared to you."

14:25.067 --> 14:27.534
And I go, "Don't slag them off."

14:27.601 --> 14:31.667
I say, "I've been there, I've done that. That's behind me."

14:31.734 --> 14:33.067
And I respect...

14:33.133 --> 14:36.934
The thing is, we're both good in our own fields.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.267
I'm sure Texas couldn't run and manage a successful paper merchant's.

14:42.334 --> 14:44.434
I couldn't do what...

14:44.500 --> 14:46.334
Actually, I could do what they do,

14:46.400 --> 14:48.901
and I think they knew that even back then.

14:48.968 --> 14:51.467
Probably what spurred them on.

(SOFT GUITAR STRUMMING)

15:03.934 --> 15:07.067
DAVID: I wrote this. I only play songs I've written myself.

15:07.133 --> 15:09.200
He went home to get it.

17:41.834 --> 17:47.234
What in the name of jumping Jehoshaphat was that song about?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.868
I mean, what was that about, then?

What's he doing? What's Warren doing telling people to say please?

You okay?

18:09.901 --> 18:12.601
Forget all about him, he's not worth it.

18:12.667 --> 18:15.367
I go through this sort of thing all the time.

18:15.434 --> 18:16.968
Although it's usually me who dumps them.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.801
He didn't... No one dumped anyone. It was just an argument.

18:19.868 --> 18:22.701
You should come out with me. I'll find you a new bloke.

18:22.767 --> 18:24.868

18:27.167 --> 18:29.367
Thanks. That's nice.

-Yeah. -Sit down.

18:40.434 --> 18:45.100

and I wouldn't be the boss or the man that I am

-Who's leaving? -I am.

Well, that's just stupid. You've got a job here for life.

20:28.300 --> 20:31.434
Yeah. Actually, I don't want to spend my life answering phones

20:31.500 --> 20:34.334
in some crappy sub-branch paper merchant's.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.868
Dawn, work hard, you could be answering those phones in Head Office

20:37.934 --> 20:39.601
or a better paper merchant's.

Gareth, she doesn't want to waste her life in paper.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.000
And are you going to lay down any of those tracks?

21:00.067 --> 21:02.400
Well, I've got a lot of 'em on demo anyway from the band days,

21:02.467 --> 21:05.400
but, you know, they're about 10 years old, so if I wanted to send them out

21:05.467 --> 21:08.667
I'd have to pretty much lay down some drum and bass shit on them.

21:08.734 --> 21:10.367
Like sample and shit.

21:10.434 --> 21:12.200
And if you take the band back on the road,

21:12.267 --> 21:13.801
are you going to need any help with that?

21:13.868 --> 21:16.267
-Look, I'm sorry to... -Hold on, man. What are you saying?

21:16.334 --> 21:18.801
You know, are you going to need a manager?

21:18.868 --> 21:21.634
Well, I'll probably manage myself, you know, 'cause...

21:21.701 --> 21:23.934
I could be your assistant manager.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.767
You could be assistant to the manager. Hold on, man. Shoot.

Yeah, it's just we've got a lot to get through and no one's back.

21:30.267 --> 21:31.834
Yeah, I'm hearing you. Do you want to go in,

21:31.901 --> 21:33.400
get them over here 'cause Rowan wants to crack on with this.

21:33.467 --> 21:34.567
-Do you want me to discipline them? -Nah,

21:34.634 --> 21:37.667
just get them over here. Done.

'Cause...

21:52.767 --> 21:56.434
Yeah. Not always for this company. I've worked for various... Hi.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.100
-Hi. -Various companies over the years.

21:59.167 --> 22:02.767
How did you get into doing this, then? How did you start?

22:02.834 --> 22:06.901
Doing what I do? There are lots of ways, really.

22:06.968 --> 22:09.167
Are you thinking of doing it?

22:09.234 --> 22:12.500
I wouldn't mind, actually. It looks like it is quite good fun.

22:12.567 --> 22:14.500
-Does it? -Yeah. It looks quite interesting.

22:16.634 --> 22:21.234
Right. This next exercise is all about forward planning

22:21.300 --> 22:23.033
and teamwork.

22:23.100 --> 22:25.734
I'm going to need to put you into pairs for this.

22:25.801 --> 22:28.834
So, um... Well, Gareth, if you can go with Tim.

22:28.901 --> 22:30.868
Oh, God!

22:30.934 --> 22:32.868
Yeah, all right, smart arse.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.200
I wouldn't want to be stuck with you in a situation, either.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.067
A situation? What...?

22:36.133 --> 22:38.667
Who would you rather be with on a desert island, then, Gareth,

22:38.734 --> 22:41.667
with some whittling wood and berries?

22:42.567 --> 22:44.234
Daley Thompson.

22:46.801 --> 22:49.868
Okay. Let me give you the problem.

22:49.934 --> 22:52.868
A farmer, not pictured,

22:52.934 --> 22:55.734
has a chicken, a bag of grain and a fox,

22:55.801 --> 22:58.033
and he needs to get them from one side of the river to the other.

22:58.100 --> 22:59.834
But, and here's the rub,

22:59.901 --> 23:03.534
his boat is only big enough to take one item at a time.

23:03.601 --> 23:07.100
So I want you to work out in what order he takes them across the river.

23:07.167 --> 23:10.067
-Remember... -Five minutes, okay?

23:10.133 --> 23:15.901
He can't take the fox first because then the chicken will eat the seed.

23:15.968 --> 23:18.834
You all right?

23:21.334 --> 23:23.467
Okay. He can't take the grain first

23:23.534 --> 23:25.801
because he can't leave the fox and the chicken together.

23:25.868 --> 23:28.400
The fox and the chicken together? Bloodbath.

23:28.467 --> 23:32.300
Yeah, I know. He can't leave the chicken with the grain.

23:32.367 --> 23:36.367
Er, hello? I'm a chicken. Thank you, Tim for leaving me with my favourite food.

23:36.434 --> 23:39.734
I was saying, Gareth, you can't do that. All right?

23:39.801 --> 23:43.367
How big is this chicken? Is it the same size as a bag of grain?

23:43.434 --> 23:45.701
-I don't know. Big chicken. -Yeah. How big?

23:45.767 --> 23:47.767
-Big. It's a super-chicken. -Hmm.

23:47.834 --> 23:49.801
What's the farmer doing with a fox?

23:49.868 --> 23:53.334
A fox is a farmer's worst enemy. He should drown the fox in the river.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.567
Gareth, it's a puzzle. It's just a puzzle.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.767
Yeah, well, it's stupid. It doesn't mean anything.

23:57.834 --> 23:59.601
What are we learning from this?

23:59.667 --> 24:03.234
It's not about learning, it's just a problem to be solved.

24:03.300 --> 24:05.634
-Put the grain on a wall. -There's not a wall.

24:05.701 --> 24:07.434
-There's always walls. -Not here, there isn't.

24:07.500 --> 24:11.434
What, there's just nothing? There's just a farm and a river?

24:11.500 --> 24:13.567
-Get his wife to help. -He ain't got a wife.

24:13.634 --> 24:16.367
-All farmers have wives. -Not this one, he's gay.

24:16.434 --> 24:19.968
Well, then he shouldn't be allowed near animals, should he?

24:20.033 --> 24:21.901
Then take the grain next.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.300
-Then the grain. -Yeah.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.400
He's got to take the chicken first

24:34.467 --> 24:37.434
so he can leave the fox with the grain.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.934
-Shall I tell them? -That's okay, I'll do it.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.868
-They're more receptive to me. -It's straightforward. Right, everybody.

24:43.934 --> 24:46.367
Here's the answer.

24:46.434 --> 24:50.200
First he takes the chicken across, leaving the fox with the grain.

24:50.267 --> 24:52.133
-Fine. -Then he comes back

24:52.200 --> 24:53.934
and takes the fox across, but he brings the chicken back with him.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.434
Then he takes the grain across, leaves it with the fox,

24:56.500 --> 24:59.367
and finally he comes back for the chicken. And he's done it.

24:59.434 --> 25:01.667
-Now, I'm sure you all got the answer... -Easy.

25:01.734 --> 25:03.701
Yeah, but you see, the important thing here

25:03.767 --> 25:05.834
is that you were all working as a team.

25:05.901 --> 25:07.934
Sorry. Gareth?

25:08.000 --> 25:09.968
Yeah. Some questions.

25:16.033 --> 25:18.701
I hope that what that exercise demonstrated was that it's vital

25:18.767 --> 25:21.667
-that every member of a team... -Follows a leader.

25:21.734 --> 25:24.901
Well, knows their place within that structure.

25:24.968 --> 25:28.334
-Some may be leaders... -He knows best, or she.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.968
Whoever's in charge

25:30.033 --> 25:32.234
-may be the person. -In a team of women, for example.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.400
It may be women or men, of course,

25:34.467 --> 25:35.868
but that somebody may be scoring the goals...

25:35.934 --> 25:38.033
DAVID: Can't stress that enough.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.634
ROWAN: No, of course. Absolutely.

25:39.701 --> 25:41.634
But it doesn't matter whether... You may not be the person

25:41.701 --> 25:43.000
ROWAN: who apparently... DAVID: Unconditional trust,

25:43.067 --> 25:45.033
is returned in leadership.

25:45.100 --> 25:50.267
It's important that you know your place and that you are supported by...

25:50.334 --> 25:53.033
-Maybe we should just move on... -Move on.

25:53.100 --> 25:55.667
-...at this stage to another exercise. -Okay.

25:55.734 --> 25:57.000
What about this one?

25:57.067 --> 26:01.434
What do we think might be the lesson here?

26:01.500 --> 26:02.701
Dogs?

26:02.767 --> 26:05.434
Say what you see, Gareth.

26:05.500 --> 26:08.133
-Give a dog a bone. -He's not Roy Walker, Gareth.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.167
All right, then, what is it?

26:10.234 --> 26:13.601
If we pull together in the same direction, it's better for all of us.

26:13.667 --> 26:15.334
Yeah, they could be fighting over them bones.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.334
They're not fighting, they're smiling.

26:17.400 --> 26:20.200
In the picture, maybe, but in reality...

26:22.400 --> 26:28.200
Look, the point here is that if the team is focused on its objectives

26:28.267 --> 26:30.100
and those of the individual members,

26:30.167 --> 26:32.901
then it's easier for everyone to achieve their goals.

26:32.968 --> 26:37.133
It's like the fable. You know the one where the dog's got a bone

26:37.200 --> 26:40.567
and he goes down to the lake to get a drink and he sees his reflection.

26:40.634 --> 26:43.200
And he goes, "That dog's got a better bone than mine.

26:43.267 --> 26:44.934
"I think I'll have his as well."

26:45.133 --> 26:47.601
And when he opens his mouth to get the bone that's a reflection,

26:47.667 --> 26:50.234
he drops the real bone and he loses both.

26:50.300 --> 26:53.500
And what's that got to do with this?

26:53.567 --> 26:56.634
It's what Gareth was saying about if we've got our bones,

26:56.701 --> 27:00.033
don't go for other people's bones, fight over them, because you'll lose your own.

27:00.100 --> 27:01.834
What does that mean?

27:03.267 --> 27:06.567
Ooh, don't you know? I thought it was...

27:06.634 --> 27:08.367
Bones.

27:08.434 --> 27:11.968
-I'm bored of this. I am so bored. -Yeah. So am I.

27:12.033 --> 27:13.968
No, sorry, I don't mean this. I mean everything.

27:14.033 --> 27:16.300
The job. I'm bored of the job. Sorry, Rowan, no disrespect.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.868
TIM: This is a waste of time. ROWAN: I know how you feel.

27:18.934 --> 27:20.901
MAN: Let's get on with this. Nearly finished now.

27:20.968 --> 27:24.534
I can't take any more of this nonsense. I can't take another boring call

27:24.601 --> 27:27.434
about Spa White index board at 230 a tonne, so...

27:27.500 --> 27:29.634
-260. -No, you're a twat, okay? Shut up.

27:29.701 --> 27:34.467
Shut up. I'll give you my... We'll work out my notice.

27:34.534 --> 27:36.701
-Right now, I'm going. Goodbye. -Tim, oh...

27:38.801 --> 27:40.167
He'll be fine.

27:41.968 --> 27:45.100
A waste of time. It was all a waste of time.

27:45.834 --> 27:48.901
Oh, see? Pressure.

27:49.133 --> 27:50.434
Not as easy as it looks.

27:50.500 --> 27:54.601
Sometimes the experience outweighs the...

27:54.667 --> 27:56.701
Sorry, David. Dawn. I was just wondering,

27:56.767 --> 28:00.067
now you've split up with Lee, would you like to come out for a drink with me?

28:01.801 --> 28:03.300
Um...

28:03.367 --> 28:06.000
I haven't split up with him.

28:08.601 --> 28:13.000
No, I know. I meant as a friend. I did mean as a friend.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.901
Okay. See you later. Yeah.

28:25.868 --> 28:28.133
Go and get the guitar.

28:31.767 --> 28:32.767
DAVID: Ooh.

28:34.534 --> 28:36.868
I'll probably write a song about this one day.

28:36.934 --> 28:39.000
(STRUMMING GUITAR)

28:43.434 --> 28:48.534
DAVID: # So what becomes of you, my love, whoa

28:48.601 --> 28:52.133
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:52.200 --> 28:54.167
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:54.234 --> 28:58.567
# That your granddad had to sweat so you could buy, yeah #

29:01.267 --> 29:06.000
We used to have a political reggae one called Equality Street. So...

29:08.334 --> 29:09.601
DAVID: Okay.
