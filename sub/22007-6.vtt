WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.271
Jeff: Previously on

00:03.304 --> 00:08.442
"survivor," at the levu tribe,
there was a clear divide.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.611
It's 2-2, I'm sticking with
you.

00:10.644 --> 00:13.681
Jeff: At the yawa tribe,
Cole couldn't hide his hunger.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.349
He licks everything.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.718
He's like a pig.

00:17.751 --> 00:21.355
Jeff: At the soko tribe,
Ryan found himself caught

00:21.389 --> 00:24.792
between a hero...
vote for roark.

00:24.825 --> 00:25.459
Yeah.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.727
Get rid of Chrissy.

00:26.760 --> 00:27.628
Chrissy?

00:27.661 --> 00:28.796
All right.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.199
There's going to be one
person who is going to hate me.

00:31.232 --> 00:40.308
Jeff: At tribal council,
Ryan voted with Chrissy.

00:40.341 --> 00:40.874
Roark.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.378
And betrayed Ali.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.246
The tribe has spoken.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.680
Good luck, guys.

00:46.714 --> 00:47.915
Jeff: 13 are left.

00:47.948 --> 00:55.723
Who will be voted out tonight?

00:55.756 --> 00:58.126
What do you want to do, Ryan?

00:58.159 --> 00:59.427
What do you want to do?

00:59.460 --> 01:03.397
You say, oh, j.P. Or Chrissy or
j.P. Or Chrissy.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.099
Uh-huh.

01:05.132 --> 01:06.834
Why can't you just tell me?

01:06.867 --> 01:09.637
Because she and you were
getting really, really close.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.373
Ryan, really?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.075
Tribal council went exactly
as planned.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.479
Ryan did follow through on his
word, which is amazing.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.282
It showed me that Ryan believes
that he can get further with me

01:21.315 --> 01:23.451
in this game than he can get
with Ali.

01:23.484 --> 01:25.319
You never told me anything.

01:25.353 --> 01:28.122
Like this is suppose to be a
two-people conversation and you

01:28.156 --> 01:29.089
never said anything.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.858
Because I thought that you
were too close.

01:30.891 --> 01:31.759
I don't care.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.194
This is a game, Ryan.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.595
You tell me how you feel.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.363
I trust you.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.731
I feel like I told you
everything.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.301
And she did not tell me
everything.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.869
Who cares about her.

01:41.902 --> 01:42.936
Then why didn't you tell me?

01:42.970 --> 01:44.538
Because you were close to
her.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.640
I knew this girl for four
days.

01:46.674 --> 01:47.241
That's the thing.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.542
You didn't trust me.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.843
I do trust you.

01:49.877 --> 01:50.844
That's why you're still her.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.079
I didn't trust her.

01:52.112 --> 01:52.780
That's why she's gone.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.282
Why didn't you tell me?

01:54.315 --> 01:57.050
You were really close to her,
Ali.

01:57.084 --> 01:57.518
You really were.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.452
Four days.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.120
That's all it takes.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.755
We voted together.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.090
We were together for six days.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.459
Tribal council was a shock.

02:05.493 --> 02:09.062
I was betrayed by my closest
ally in this whole entire thing,

02:09.096 --> 02:09.597
you know?

02:09.630 --> 02:10.264
And it hurts.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.699
Wait.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.768
You thought I would kick you
to the curb, Ryan?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.670
No, she was going to.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.607
I would never have kicked you
to the curb, so why wouldn't you

02:19.640 --> 02:20.174
tell me.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.375
Because I thought...

02:21.409 --> 02:24.845
I said 100 times I wasn't
going to come out here and cry,

02:24.878 --> 02:29.583
but, you know, it's rough, and I
just want to do my best.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.685
Were you in an alliance with
you?

02:31.719 --> 02:33.987
New York I was in an alliance
with her.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.657
I would have didn't whatever
you wanted me to do, Ryan.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.192
That's not true.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.329
Being pushed down to the
bottom, it's a wake-up caulk

02:41.362 --> 02:43.597
because moving forward, I have
to understand, it's just me,

02:43.631 --> 02:46.700
because I don't think I will
ever trust Ryan again in this

02:46.734 --> 02:47.167
game.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.068
I love Chrissy.

02:48.101 --> 02:48.902
I think she's great.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.838
You just wrote Chrissy's name
down.

02:50.871 --> 02:55.243
Because I thought that's what
you wanted as well.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.210
Why are you getting so mad?

02:56.244 --> 02:58.246
How am I getting mad?

02:58.279 --> 03:04.552
So Ali rails into me, and it
was a really bad look for her.

03:04.585 --> 03:08.289
I was hoping I could still work
with Ali at this point.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.459
Unfortunately Ali is infuriated
with me because I didn't tell

03:11.492 --> 03:14.895
her, and it stinks because I
can't have enemies in this game.

03:14.928 --> 03:24.972
So she may have to go.

03:24.972 --> 03:30.244
So she may have to go.

03:36.684 --> 03:40.153
Oh, my god, first time
catching fish with a speargun,

03:40.187 --> 03:41.389
it is amazing.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.423
It's like I can do this.

03:42.456 --> 03:46.827
I can do anything that I put my
heart and mind to.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.495
Little fish.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.296
It's still a fish.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.130
I am providing for my tribe.

03:50.163 --> 03:53.867
I am so excited to be able to be
like, yeah, dude, I caught the

03:53.901 --> 03:54.167
fish, too.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.068
Nice.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.837
It's not much, but it's
something.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.171
Do you feel like man?

03:58.205 --> 03:59.172
Yeah.

03:59.206 --> 04:02.410
The simple things in life can
be so rewarding.

04:02.443 --> 04:05.279
Flame broiled.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.013
Fish filet.

04:06.046 --> 04:11.184
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.721
[Laughter]
He's gone, doc.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.788
No, he's not gone.

04:14.822 --> 04:15.989
He's gone.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.291
That's okay.

04:17.325 --> 04:20.494
My fish is not gone.

04:20.528 --> 04:25.533
He just cooked a little faster.

04:25.566 --> 04:28.135
[Laughter]
Oh, I'm is glad we're on a

04:28.168 --> 04:30.438
tribe together, Mike.

04:30.471 --> 04:34.041
Mikey, that poor guy, he was
determined, though.

04:34.074 --> 04:35.476
That man never gave up.

04:35.509 --> 04:39.146
Through hell or high water, Mike
was cooking that fish, and

04:39.179 --> 04:39.780
eating it.

04:39.813 --> 04:40.848
I'm proud of him.

04:40.881 --> 04:44.818
He's out of his element, an he's
doing good.

04:44.852 --> 04:46.487
What do you think, not batting
right?

04:46.520 --> 04:47.855
No, man.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.457
I think it would be good.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.258
Thanks for sharing.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.928
You know, Mike caught a small
fish and he shared that.

04:54.962 --> 04:59.266
Cole caught a decent-sized fish,
and he ate it for himself a

04:59.299 --> 05:00.401
couple times that.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.703
Shows right there who you should
work with in this game.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.339
Someone who is going the share
and think about others or

05:05.373 --> 05:08.576
someone who is just going to
think about himself.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.578
Cole is showing his true colors.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.080
And they ain't good.

05:13.113 --> 05:15.148
So should we get started on
the rice?

05:15.182 --> 05:17.785
The only thing is we don't
have a lot of rice.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.452
I'm good.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.020
I'm not even hungry.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.422
I'm happy waiting.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.558
I don't think we should cut
out a whole meal.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.594
That's not how your body works.

05:26.627 --> 05:29.563
That's how it has to work
here because we don't have that

05:29.597 --> 05:30.364
much food.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.999
I'm just trying to be realistic.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.567
Please don't cut me off.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.304
I was trying to talk and you
kind of dominate conversations.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.039
Talk, buddy.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.975
Talk till your heart can't have
no more.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.377
Eat big while you have it.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.780
I'm saying nobody here is
starving to chew, and we can't

05:46.814 --> 05:47.748
just feed you.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.683
I mean, if you want the eat your
rice, cook it.

05:49.717 --> 05:52.786
That's fine.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.656
I said we'll go with what we
decided.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.225
I'm not getting enough food at
all, and it's stupid.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.561
I'm not going to be strong
enough at any challenge to

06:00.594 --> 06:03.731
guarantee that we'll come away
winning, and I really need a

06:03.764 --> 06:07.701
bigger serving because without
me, there wouldn't be any

06:07.735 --> 06:11.972
victory for the yawa tribe.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.340
I'm sick of him.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.442
I am so sick of him.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.476
He's tripping out.

06:15.509 --> 06:18.145
He's a piece of work is what
he is.

06:18.178 --> 06:22.483
I'd like to say that he's 24,
but when we were 24, we weren't

06:22.516 --> 06:23.150
like that.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.117
No.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.219
We'll let him seal his own fate.

06:26.253 --> 06:29.923
The two of them, they're
trying to be a power couple or

06:29.957 --> 06:30.424
what.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.158
They're together.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.293
You make me nervous
sometimes.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.328
Why do I make you nervous?

06:35.362 --> 06:39.099
Because I forget how to talk
to really pretty girls.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.934
She's smart girl.

06:40.968 --> 06:44.004
I can't imagine her going to
live in a van with him, because

06:44.037 --> 06:45.606
he's not going the leave the
van.

06:45.639 --> 06:48.108
And the way he throws fits
when he doesn't get his way.

06:48.141 --> 06:51.512
I think Mike is starting to
see what Cole's true colors are,

06:51.545 --> 06:56.349
which is great for me, because
I'm at the bottom of this group.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.818
So we need Dr. Mike.

06:57.851 --> 07:01.589
You know, the more Cole screws
up, the more he acts like an

07:01.622 --> 07:03.657
idiot, the better off I am.

07:03.691 --> 07:11.565
Cole is digging his own grave.

07:18.506 --> 07:22.543

07:41.128 --> 07:50.671
Jeff: Come on in, guys.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.240
Yawa, levu, getting your first
look at the new soko tribe.

07:53.273 --> 07:59.680
Roark voted out at the last
tribal council.

07:59.713 --> 08:02.049
All right
you guys ready to get to today's

08:02.082 --> 08:02.449
reward challenge?

08:02.482 --> 08:03.617
Yes.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.253
Jeff: For today's challenge
you'll race out the a set of

08:06.286 --> 08:07.287
poles.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.358
We'll use those poles to
transport a buoy across a

08:11.391 --> 08:12.459
balance beam.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.762
That buoy will release your
boat.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.765
You'll pull your boat to the
finish, where you will use a

08:17.798 --> 08:22.803
giant slingshot to knock down
two targets.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.772
First two tribes to finish win
reward.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.339
Want to know what you're playing
for?

08:26.373 --> 08:27.007
Yes.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.075
Please.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.978
Jeff: Let me tease you as
long as I can for pizza.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.913
Oh, my god.

08:32.946 --> 08:34.081
Oh, my god.

08:34.114 --> 08:38.818
Jeff: Ten pizzas and ice
cold soft drinks, second tribe

08:38.852 --> 08:45.525
the finish, one pizza to share
with the tribe.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.494
For the losers, nothing.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.830
Yawa, you have one extra person,
sitting somebody out whom is it

08:49.863 --> 08:50.363
going to be.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.531
I'll sit out.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.700
Jeff: Mike, take a spot on
the bench.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.235
Everybody else take a minute to
strategize.

08:55.268 --> 09:02.175
We'll get it on.

09:02.209 --> 09:02.743
All right.

09:02.776 --> 09:03.476
Here we go.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.513
For reward, survivors ready?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.748
Go!

09:07.781 --> 09:11.018
Go, Ali, go, j.P.

09:11.051 --> 09:11.985
Jeff: Ben.

09:12.019 --> 09:12.920
Ali takes hard fall.

09:12.953 --> 09:14.421
She's with j.P.

09:14.454 --> 09:20.360
And Ashley and Desi, you have to
transport that using these two

09:20.393 --> 09:23.997
poles over a balance beam and
down to the mat.

09:24.031 --> 09:26.233
Everybody good out of the gate.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.267
Desi and Ashley drop.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.401
They have to go back.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.436
Ben and Cole drop.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.537
They have to go back.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.105
Go, go, go.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.073
Keep going, keep going.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.575
Jeff: J.P. And Ali making
it look easy.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.677
You're good.

09:36.710 --> 09:41.548
Big lead for soko.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.717
Chrissy and Ryan, no buoy to
transfer.

09:43.751 --> 09:44.818
Just get through the course.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.620
There goes Ashley and Desi
again.

09:46.654 --> 09:47.287
They drop again.

09:47.320 --> 09:48.756
Got to go back.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.791
Chrissy and Ryan heading over
the beam.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.460
A lot easier with no buoy to
transfer.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.929
Ben and Cole trying again.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.598
Can they do it this time?

09:58.632 --> 09:59.032
Yes.

09:59.066 --> 09:59.532
You're good.

09:59.566 --> 10:02.636
Drop it.

10:02.670 --> 10:07.007
Go, and Jessica on the course.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.075
Soko now has everybody.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.277
They're headed to their boat.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.311
Soko now at their boat.

10:11.344 --> 10:15.949
Got to untie those knots before
you can head out.

10:15.983 --> 10:20.420
Desi and Ashley drop for the
third time.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.089
Lauren's across.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.390
Jessica's across.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.557
Go, yawa.

10:24.591 --> 10:25.625
Come on, guys.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.860
Let's go.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.095
Get it.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.798
You guys, you're catching
them.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.865
You got this.

10:31.899 --> 10:35.502
Jeff: You got to pull
yourself all the way to your

10:35.535 --> 10:38.071
platform.

10:38.105 --> 10:38.638
Soko is stuck.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.173
You got to untie.

10:40.207 --> 10:40.974
We did.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.242
There's one in the back.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.846
Jeff: Soko forgot to untie
one of the knots, a huge

10:45.879 --> 10:46.113
setback.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.147
Go!

10:47.180 --> 10:49.216
Go, go, go, go go, !

10:49.249 --> 10:51.719
Jeff: Jessica whips through
the knot.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.753
Yawa caught up now.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.521
Chrissy finally has the knots
untied.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.089
It's a race to the platform.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.258
We are dead even.

10:58.291 --> 11:03.163
Yawa and soko have had a huge
head start in this challenge.

11:03.196 --> 11:06.366
They're heading out to the
slingshot.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.737
Ashley and Desi have got to get
across.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.072
Together, together.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.907
Jeff: And they do.

11:13.941 --> 11:16.109
You're good.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.645
Devon and Joe now have to rip
through this course, trying to

11:18.678 --> 11:19.312
close this gap.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.580
You got to get over that beam.

11:20.613 --> 11:22.482
Joe struggling.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.751
Got away on Joe.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.486
It's easy, it's easy.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.488
Jeff: You're good.

11:28.521 --> 11:33.460
Blue has got to pick it up now.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.928
Ben is to the platform.

11:34.962 --> 11:40.033
J.P. To the platform.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.368
Levu trying to get back in this.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.637
You have one slingshot and two
targets.

11:44.671 --> 11:45.739
Come on, j.P.

11:45.773 --> 11:49.609
Jeff: It's going to be Ben
for yawa, j.P. For soko.

11:49.642 --> 11:50.744
A little higher.

11:50.778 --> 11:55.148
Drew: And here comes levu
trying to get back in this.

11:55.182 --> 11:58.752
J.P. Just short.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.153
Ben just short.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.122
Get up there.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.091
Jeff: Levu finally across.

12:04.124 --> 12:07.861
Levu is back in this now.

12:07.895 --> 12:12.699
Ben really leaning back.

12:12.732 --> 12:17.070
Ben misses.

12:17.104 --> 12:20.173
The swells really coming in on
this challenge, making it very

12:20.207 --> 12:23.243
difficult to judge, because
everything is moving.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.545
The platform is moving, the
boats are moving.

12:25.578 --> 12:28.882
Nothing is easy on "survivor."

12:28.916 --> 12:29.616
Yeah!

12:29.649 --> 12:32.119
Jeff: J.P. Connects for
soko.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.188
Soko now with one target left.

12:35.222 --> 12:38.225
Ben one more time on his knees
and connects.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.995
Yawa knocks their first target
down.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.463
Joe going to pop out.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.497
It's Devon in now.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.100
Here comes a huge swell.

12:47.134 --> 12:53.606
J.P. Taking his time, waiting
for the swell.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.377
Everybody's platform moving all
over the place now.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.247
Boats are everywhere, platforms
are everywhere.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.183
The ocean is moving today.

13:03.216 --> 13:04.584
You got to be lined up right.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.488
You have to anticipate the
swells.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.790
Adjustments being made by
everybody.

13:10.824 --> 13:14.727
You got to earn it out here
every day on "survivor."

13:14.761 --> 13:18.798
J.P. Has waited patiently.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.400
J.P. Does it.

13:20.433 --> 13:25.738
Soko wins reward, pizzas and
soft drinks.

13:25.772 --> 13:29.709
Looking for second.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.679
Yawa wins reward!

13:32.712 --> 13:33.680
Good job, guys.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.115
Good job, guys.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.117
Good job, guys.

13:37.150 --> 13:42.856
J.P., that was so awesome.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.892
Jeff: Soko, nice victory.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.261
Ten pizzas will be waiting for
you back at camp.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.697
Should make for a very nice and
well-earned afternoon.

13:50.730 --> 13:51.731
Grab your stuff.

13:51.764 --> 13:52.432
Head back.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.335
Enjoy the pizza in Fiji.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.470
Yawa, one pizza waiting for you
back at camp.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.305
Nice job.

13:58.338 --> 14:02.742
Grab your stuff, head back,
enjoy it.

14:02.775 --> 14:03.877
Levu, got nothing for you.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.213
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

14:06.246 --> 14:09.749
I don't like to be in the
limelight that much, but in this

14:09.782 --> 14:12.685
case, it's just good for my
game, because bottom line is

14:12.719 --> 14:14.421
they need more 100%.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.890
Without me there's in way they
would be able to get through any

14:16.924 --> 14:17.324
challenge.

14:17.357 --> 14:23.630
No way.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.746
Oh, my gosh, there's like
salami.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.748
Artichoke and mushroom.

14:41.781 --> 14:44.717
It's more fun to eat a whole
pizza.

14:44.751 --> 14:47.254
This was the one to win.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.057
Sitting there watching them
struggle and j.P. Do it with

14:50.090 --> 14:50.623
ease.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.824
Basking in his glory.

14:51.858 --> 14:54.727
You were so good with that
slingshot.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.829
J.P. Is a tank in these
challenges.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.799
I guess being a firefighter he
has that strength to him, but he

14:59.832 --> 15:02.569
is very athletic.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.637
And the merge is going to happen
very soon.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.407
The physical part of the game is
a very big aspect, and that

15:07.440 --> 15:10.010
raises the threat level of j.P.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.879
My ideal first date is
bonfire on the beach.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.646
Really?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.915
Yeah, pick dinner up
somewhere.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.450
Most of the time I do a salad.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.520
He's also somebody who is
tough to read because he doesn't

15:20.553 --> 15:21.788
talk much strategy at all.

15:21.821 --> 15:25.158
J.P. Likes talking about chicks
and bars and stuff that I don't

15:25.192 --> 15:26.994
know anything about.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.897
He really just has no clue
what's going on in this game.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.467
I put it back in my truck.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.702
Big salad to go.

15:35.735 --> 15:38.471
You sit on the beach and share,
make a fire on the beach, hang

15:38.505 --> 15:40.473
out, look at the stars.

15:40.507 --> 15:42.475
Nothing like some wood in the
back of the truck.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.344
Yeah.

15:44.377 --> 15:48.515
J.P. Doesn't understand that
this is a social game.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.017
And it's amazing that he's still
here.

15:50.050 --> 15:54.254
So if we go the tribal council,
maybe taking out a big, physical

15:54.287 --> 16:01.894
threat right before the merge
should be priority number one.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.563
Wait, wait.

16:03.596 --> 16:08.801
Our camp, when you were
looking at the well, this is

16:08.835 --> 16:11.204
your stomach, this is the water,
where was the idol?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.739
Where I looked initially.

16:12.772 --> 16:14.341
So what do you think?

16:14.374 --> 16:18.145
Do you think they would go to
rocks for each other?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.346
Or do you think Desi would flip?

16:19.379 --> 16:22.049
I think Desi would flip.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.353
If there is an immunity
challenge here shortly with this

16:26.386 --> 16:27.520
tribe, I am nervous.

16:27.554 --> 16:31.758
There's only four ofous, two
yellow, Joe and Desi, and then

16:31.791 --> 16:34.727
me and Devon, who are pretty
much like this.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.430
We're kind of an unbreakable
alliance.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.832
I want to make the merge.

16:39.866 --> 16:40.833
Don't flip on me.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.669
I'm not going to flip on you.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.738
In the case of the tribal
council, it's look like it would

16:45.772 --> 16:46.673
be 2-2.

16:46.706 --> 16:56.716
The plan would be to get Desi to
flip on Joe.

16:56.749 --> 16:59.286
High as well take some of
this, right?

16:59.319 --> 17:03.123
Keep your eyes out for
coconuts.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.557
The energy is very tense around
here.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.858
I feel like there's a hidden
immunity idol still out, there

17:06.893 --> 17:09.396
and Joe is good at finding
idols.

17:09.429 --> 17:10.563
He's already found one.

17:10.597 --> 17:11.763
That's better than my record.

17:11.798 --> 17:15.667
Big hermit crowd some everythi
that Joe does is suspicious.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.137
We're us a looking out for him
and looking to see where he's

17:18.171 --> 17:18.738
looking.

17:18.771 --> 17:19.771
Beastly.

17:19.806 --> 17:22.442
I got the keep eagle eyes on
Joe.

17:22.474 --> 17:23.643
He's got me nervous.

17:23.675 --> 17:27.747
You guys are really close,
but Joe is the most strategic

17:27.780 --> 17:29.416
player we've met.

17:29.449 --> 17:32.285
He could be getting anyone to
trust him just as long as it

17:32.319 --> 17:35.755
works for him.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.590
Definitely had that thought.

17:37.624 --> 17:40.059
Do you really feel like you
can trust him?

17:40.093 --> 17:40.760
Yeah.

17:40.793 --> 17:45.031
I mean, I trust him as far as...

17:45.064 --> 17:47.434
I thing he'll stick with us to a
point.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.403
It's just matter of to what
point.

17:50.437 --> 17:54.741
Let me ask you this, would
you vote him out?

17:54.774 --> 17:56.008
Oh, yeah.

17:56.042 --> 18:01.614
I think if he doesn't get voted
out, he wins this game.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.283
Ashley brought up the idea of
getting rid of Joe.

18:03.316 --> 18:09.055
I mean, I trust Joe to the point
that he'll use me as an advance

18:09.088 --> 18:10.323
for himself in this game.

18:10.357 --> 18:13.193
Beyond that, Joe is arguably the
most strategic player out here,

18:13.226 --> 18:16.729
willing to do whatever it takes
to make himself move further in

18:16.763 --> 18:17.664
this game.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.866
That's going to maybe not always
benefit me.

18:19.899 --> 18:26.273
So if the levu tribe has to go
back the tribal council I am

18:26.306 --> 18:27.640
actually considering getting rid
of Joe at this time.

18:27.674 --> 18:28.808
You got water?

18:28.841 --> 18:29.642
I'm good.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.711
You don't drink enough water,
man.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.481
I'm going to check up on you a
little bit more.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.016
Forget about that stuff, man.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.117
I'm not stupid.

18:38.151 --> 18:42.155
I know Devon is watching me
because I'm dangerous.

18:42.189 --> 18:44.957
Like I'm always searching for
idols and looking for idols.

18:44.991 --> 18:47.860
My game is to have power,
control, and to manipulate.

18:47.894 --> 18:52.131
And I've been trying the find a
clue.

18:52.165 --> 19:01.341
I just need some time alone to
find it.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.375
Oh, my god.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.043
It took four days to find it.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.012
But I finally found a clue.

19:06.045 --> 19:07.780
Very similar to the healer camp.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.016
I knew it, you know what I'm
saying?

19:10.049 --> 19:11.184
I knew about the well.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.521
It just happened to be four feet
away instead of five feet.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.857
I didn't really give Devon any
reaction.

19:17.890 --> 19:18.891
Nothing.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.294
I definitely want to get rid
of the clue later.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.930
This time around, no one is
going to know that I have it.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.365
That's what I wanted initially.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.301
When I found first one, Cole.

19:28.335 --> 19:30.837
This time around if I get the
immunity idol New York one is

19:30.870 --> 19:32.505
going to know that I have the
idol.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.607
That right there is true power.

19:34.641 --> 19:44.684
I will be getting that idol
tonight.

19:44.684 --> 19:54.794
I will be getting that idol
tonight.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.395
This is not a vacation for me.

19:55.428 --> 19:56.496
It's work.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.830
Find another idol that
represents moving further in the

19:57.864 --> 20:00.500
game, and the further I get, the
closer I get the that $1

20:00.533 --> 20:01.634
million.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.036
The closer I can provide that
much more for my children.

20:04.070 --> 20:08.107
You know, I tell my kids all the
time, things don't come easy.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.943
You have to put in the work.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.813
And, you know, my kids are my
motivation.

20:13.846 --> 20:14.981
Everything I do is for them.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.551
If I had to dig a hole the
length of Tennessee, I'm going

20:18.585 --> 20:19.519
to do it.

20:19.552 --> 20:26.426
Oh, man.

20:29.829 --> 20:30.463
Hello, baby.

20:30.497 --> 20:31.531
I've been at two camps.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.866
This is my second idol I've
found.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.067
I'm going to keep it a secret.

20:35.101 --> 20:38.271
If I move on to the merge, guess
what, I'm going to find the

20:38.305 --> 20:42.509
third idol.

21:05.965 --> 21:06.699
Gross.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.000
A worm literally just fell on
me.

21:08.034 --> 21:08.935
Do you want it to eat.

21:08.968 --> 21:09.836
I'm good.

21:09.869 --> 21:12.605
A worm just fell out of our
roof on me.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.005
That's gross.

21:13.039 --> 21:13.673
Yeah.

21:13.706 --> 21:14.341
Right?

21:14.374 --> 21:18.445
That's why I cover my ears.

21:18.478 --> 21:21.147
Oh, my god.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.583
How did you do that.

21:23.616 --> 21:23.983
Cole?

21:24.016 --> 21:24.384
Are you okay?

21:24.417 --> 21:25.418
What?

21:25.452 --> 21:26.018
Cole?

21:26.052 --> 21:26.886
What happened?

21:26.919 --> 21:28.054
Just lay down.

21:28.087 --> 21:29.756
Lay down.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.723
Put your legs up.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.959
Lay like that with your legs up
a little bit.

21:32.992 --> 21:35.362
Do we have water for him?

21:35.395 --> 21:36.963
Keep your legs up.

21:36.996 --> 21:37.730
Whatting just happened?

21:37.764 --> 21:38.931
He just passed out.

21:38.965 --> 21:42.435
I thought I was standing up
over there, and the next thing

21:42.469 --> 21:43.035
I'm dreaming or something.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.404
He needs to eat.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.572
He can have my portion of rice.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.773
I feel good now.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.008
Of course you do.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.142
You just passed out.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.445
No, but I'll just chill and
take it easy.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.448
I'm going to cook some rice.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.583
Cole faipghted.

21:56.616 --> 22:00.553
My initial feeling is just
straight fear, like all of us

22:00.587 --> 22:01.854
are scared.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.191
But Dr. Mike and I were in
control, we knew to get fluid in

22:05.224 --> 22:05.692
him.

22:05.725 --> 22:06.893
We knew to get food.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.895
He did with it two healers in
the healthcare world.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.397
I'm really going to be okay.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.064
We know you're going to be
okay.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.666
I just stood up too fast.

22:13.700 --> 22:16.436
No, you didn't, you are
depleted.

22:16.469 --> 22:17.169
That's what you are.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.871
It's a food-related issue.

22:18.905 --> 22:20.172
I felt bad for him.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.208
I literally just wanted to hold
him.

22:22.241 --> 22:25.512
And in that moment I realized
that I really do care for him a

22:25.545 --> 22:28.915
lot more than I thought I did.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.851
I'm not ready to play this game
put Cole.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.152
Dinner is served.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.422
I feel so ridiculous.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.589
I just feel like a burden.

22:36.623 --> 22:39.759
Just eat it.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.293
Cole, you okay over there?

22:41.327 --> 22:43.329
Yeah, I'm good.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.931
Cole's going to be fine.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.801
We just got to make sure he's
fine.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.603
But Cole has become a liability.

22:50.637 --> 22:54.040
If you don't feel well enough on
day 16, how are you going to

22:54.073 --> 22:56.776
feel on day 17 and 18 or 23?

22:56.809 --> 22:59.746
We're just going to have to keep
pulling and pulling him along,

22:59.779 --> 23:03.816
and at some point the scales are
like... we need the get rid of

23:03.850 --> 23:04.851
Cole.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.454
Nothing exciting here happened
while you were gone.

23:07.487 --> 23:09.288
Cole could not pass out.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.123
He got up and passed out.

23:11.157 --> 23:11.891
Wow.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.660
Fell like a tre trunk.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.928
Take it easy, big guy.

23:15.962 --> 23:16.596
Drink some water.

23:16.629 --> 23:22.469
Thanks for having my back.

23:22.502 --> 23:25.772
I don't know, doc.

23:25.805 --> 23:31.110
He should have worried about his
appetite more than his six pack.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.879
Pack on a few pounds, you know?

23:32.912 --> 23:33.580
He's a liability.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.614
Oh yeah,.

23:34.647 --> 23:36.148
I agree.

23:36.182 --> 23:36.883
We take out Cole.

23:36.916 --> 23:39.185
Exactly.

23:39.218 --> 23:44.256
We can't pander and cater to him
and baby him any longer.

23:44.290 --> 23:44.924
I agree.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.192
Out.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.194
It's funny how things work in
this game.

23:48.227 --> 23:49.829
When Cole fell over, he sealed
his fate.

23:49.862 --> 23:53.466
I feel bad saying, that but it's
true.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.136
I think Lauren and doc have the
same agenda as I do, so if we do

23:57.169 --> 24:03.743
lose and immunity challenge,
Jess' boyfriend is gone.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.679
Just know that as long as I'm
not passed out on the ground,

24:06.713 --> 24:08.314
I'm here for you and I care
about you.

24:08.347 --> 24:20.827
Thanks, Cole.

24:24.430 --> 24:36.809
Jeff: Come on in, guys.

24:36.843 --> 24:37.677
All right.

24:37.710 --> 24:41.080
Let's get to today's immunity
challenge.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.683
First things first, I will take
back the idols.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.817
Desi, you don't want to give it
up.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.586
New York I'm taking good care
of her.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.120
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.857
Jeff: Thanks, Lauren.

24:50.890 --> 24:54.661
Once again immunity is back up
for grabs.

24:54.694 --> 25:00.066
For today's challenge, you will
each pull on a rope suspending a

25:00.099 --> 25:01.167
disk.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.904
You'll then work together to
stack blocks on that disk

25:04.937 --> 25:08.040
spelling "immunity."

25:08.074 --> 25:14.947
If at any point you fall off or
your tack drops, you tart again.

25:14.981 --> 25:19.351
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

25:19.385 --> 25:21.654
Losers tribal council will
somebody will be the sixth

25:21.688 --> 25:24.290
person voted out of this game.

25:24.323 --> 25:27.193
Yawa, one extra person, sitting
somebody out.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.762
Dr. Mike sat out of the reward
challenge.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.298
Who is going to sit out of this
one?

25:32.331 --> 25:33.566
Lauren take a spot on the bench.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.501
Everybody else take a minute to
strategize.

25:35.534 --> 25:41.440
We'll get started.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.074
All right.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.475
Here we go.

25:43.509 --> 25:47.614
For immunity, survivors ready?

25:47.647 --> 25:49.381
Go!

25:49.415 --> 25:50.416
Joe, you're first.

25:50.449 --> 25:51.984
Jeff: It's all about
communecation.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.586
Now Ryan, pull it tight.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.023
Jeff: Working together to
spell immunity.

25:57.056 --> 26:00.392
Remember, you are spelling it
from the bottom to the top.

26:00.426 --> 26:01.994
Ben places the first block for
yawa.

26:02.028 --> 26:03.630
A little tighter, Ryan.

26:03.663 --> 26:04.931
Jeff: Ryan out quickly.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.133
Perfect.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.000
That's right.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.535
Jeff: Joe has first letter
for levu.

26:09.568 --> 26:10.536
I'll be next.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.538
Jeff: It's all about
keeping that disk flat.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.841
Ryan, pull a little bit,
buddy.

26:14.874 --> 26:15.775
Jeff: And balanced.

26:15.808 --> 26:18.611
Ben, pull a little harder.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.814
Jeff: As this stack gross,
it's going to get more

26:21.848 --> 26:22.581
difficult.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.950
Jessica with their second
letter.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.217
Desi with their second letter.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.218
You're pulling it up.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.954
Jeff: Chrissy working for
their second letter.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.989
Ryan, pull a little, budsdy.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.791
J.P., I think you're too
tight.

26:31.824 --> 26:32.591
My way?

26:32.625 --> 26:35.161
Jeff: Ben places the I for
yawa.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.028
Levu with three.

26:36.062 --> 26:37.196
Soko coming with their third.

26:37.229 --> 26:45.104
Here comes Ryan inching closer
with that I.

26:45.137 --> 26:46.939
Already you can see how much
movement there is.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.941
Very close to losing it early in
this challenge.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.711
Ryan you're, too tight.

26:51.744 --> 26:54.847
Jeff: Soko has the start
over, our first casualty.

26:54.881 --> 26:59.018
Levu now in the lead with the
fifth letter.

26:59.051 --> 27:02.955
Here comes Cole now with that
fifth letter.

27:02.989 --> 27:04.623
Soko starting over.

27:04.657 --> 27:09.996
Ashley places the sixth block.

27:10.029 --> 27:10.930
Levu getting very close.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.232
Putting the pressure now on
yawa.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.466
There's Jessica with the sixth
block.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.035
There you go.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.705
Jeff: Chrissy has the third
block for soko.

27:18.738 --> 27:19.305
Here comes Desi.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.240
No, no, no, don't pull.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.242
Jeff: Desi, they're in
trouble.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.577
Levu drops just like that and
yawa is now in the lead.

27:25.611 --> 27:27.847
That is how quickly this can
change.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.315
Pull more, Ryan.

27:29.348 --> 27:30.316
Ryan!

27:30.349 --> 27:32.151
Jeff: And soko drops.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.653
Both tribes now starting over.

27:34.687 --> 27:35.955
We got it, guys.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.857
Jeff: Dr. Mike now for
yawa.

27:37.890 --> 27:43.629
They have a huge advantage, only
one block left to win immunity

27:43.662 --> 27:48.334
and a lot of time while soko and
levu battle it out for the

27:48.367 --> 27:48.901
second immunity.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.402
Keep breathing, guys.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.704
Don't move your arms.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.139
Jeff: Here goes Cole.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.473
He's making his moves.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.242
Cole can win it for yawa right
here.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.244
Go ahead, Cole, slowly.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.213
Jeff: Can Cole finish it
right here?

28:01.247 --> 28:05.351
She... slow and steady.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.086
Jeff: Cole has the I.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.320
They are steady.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.224
Now he just has to get back to
the finish without any movement

28:12.258 --> 28:13.359
and there goes the move.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.493
And yawa is out.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.328
Yawa has to start over.

28:16.362 --> 28:20.232
They were just a few footsteps
away from immunity.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.801
The door is back open.

28:21.834 --> 28:27.473
It is now levu and soko dead
even with five blocks each.

28:27.506 --> 28:31.944
This is how fast this game
changes.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.913
Ben is new racing out with that
first block.

28:33.946 --> 28:36.515
It is now Ashley with the sixth
block.

28:36.548 --> 28:36.949
There we go.

28:36.983 --> 28:37.884
We straight now.

28:37.917 --> 28:40.352
Jeff: Here comes Ali with
the sixth block.

28:40.386 --> 28:41.653
This would tie them with levu.

28:41.687 --> 28:42.688
We got this.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.291
Jeff: Yawa with two,
quickly chasing everybody.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.126
Here comes Cole with the third
letter.

28:47.159 --> 28:50.629
Jeff: Chrissy now with the
seventh letter for soko.

28:50.662 --> 28:53.665
Levu right on their heels with
their seventh letter.

28:53.699 --> 28:55.267
We got the tension, Mike.

28:55.301 --> 28:55.868
You just walk.

28:55.902 --> 28:57.736
Mike, we got the rope.

28:57.770 --> 29:00.206
Jeff: Yawa with a
completely new strategy, racing

29:00.239 --> 29:01.107
to catch up.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.042
Mike now with the fourth letter.

29:03.075 --> 29:07.446
We have levu and soko both with
seven letters, just one letter

29:07.479 --> 29:08.114
left.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.681
Yawa is already halfway there.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.650
Mike with their fifth.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.019
Yawa's strategy may be paying
off.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.653
Just walk it back, Mike.

29:14.686 --> 29:17.289
Jeff: Here comes j.P. With
that final letter.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.624
Just go slow.

29:18.657 --> 29:21.527
Jeff: He cannot move as
fast as yawa is because the

29:21.560 --> 29:23.963
stack is so tall.

29:23.996 --> 29:24.831
Devon moving very slowly.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.099
Whoa, whoa, Devon.

29:27.133 --> 29:30.402
Jeff: Jessica coming out
now with their seventh letter.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.703
You guys got it?

29:31.737 --> 29:32.939
Yep, we have it.

29:32.972 --> 29:34.306
Jeff: J.P. Very close.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.507
Careful, j.P.

29:35.541 --> 29:37.977
Jeff: But that tower is
leaning.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.047
Jessica places the seventh
letter for yawa.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.014
Devon now making his move.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.315
Slowly.

29:43.349 --> 29:45.451
Careful, j.P.

29:45.484 --> 29:46.652
J.P.

29:46.685 --> 29:49.221
Jeff: J.P. Places the I,
but he's got to get it to stick.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.222
Take you time.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.859
Drew: Jessica new racing out
with the I.

29:52.892 --> 29:53.960
Everybody is in it now.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.127
Get it.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.529
You're doing good, Dev.

29:57.563 --> 30:01.200
Jeff: Devon places the I,
but he knows it is wobbly.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.802
Do not let it drop.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.737
Jeff: Jessica places if I
for yawa.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.139
Everybody has their blocks.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.407
It's now a race to the finish.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.844
Get back, Jess.

30:11.878 --> 30:12.879
Don't move.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.481
Nobody move.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.483
We win.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.517
We got it.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.920
Jeff: Yawa wins immunity.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.588
We're looking for second.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.023
Soak second dropped.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.191
Soko is out now.

30:25.224 --> 30:29.795
Levu has a shot right here.

30:29.828 --> 30:35.101
Levu wins immunity, safe from
tribal council.

30:35.134 --> 30:46.879
Sending soko for the sixth
person voted out of this game.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.480
Yawa, congratulations.

30:48.514 --> 30:51.717
Nobody going home tonight.

30:51.750 --> 30:55.721
Levu, everybody will live to see
another day.

30:55.754 --> 30:56.755
All right.

30:56.788 --> 30:58.324
Yawa, levu, no tribal council
tonight.

30:58.357 --> 30:59.992
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

31:00.026 --> 31:02.661
Enjoy the night off.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.130
All right.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.297
Soko, head back to camp.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.866
See you tonight at tribal where
somebody will be the sixth

31:07.900 --> 31:09.568
person voted out of this game.

31:09.601 --> 31:14.140
After tribal I had a blow-up
with Ryan, so I know that my

31:14.173 --> 31:17.043
name has been on the line, and
I'm more nervous than I probably

31:17.076 --> 31:21.280
ever have been.

31:34.893 --> 31:35.794
I think Jeff likes us.

31:35.827 --> 31:39.999
We always have a lot of dates
with him, huh?

31:40.032 --> 31:42.969
Yep.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.938
Well, today's challenge
didn't go so well, but losing

31:45.972 --> 31:48.140
for us right now is just not a
big deal.

31:48.174 --> 31:51.610
Ali is next, and she has nothing
she can do about it.

31:51.643 --> 31:56.682
Simple as that.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.850
Sucks to lose, but
sometimes...

31:58.884 --> 31:59.818
I did not want to lose.

31:59.851 --> 32:02.021
It all works out for the
better.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.190
Yeah.

32:04.223 --> 32:07.994
Ali is the obvious next target,
but j.P. Is a huge physical

32:08.027 --> 32:09.228
threat.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.764
I mean, he has literally carried
us, he's carried me through a

32:12.798 --> 32:13.765
challenge, literally.

32:13.799 --> 32:15.467
Taking that guy into a merge,
that's dangerous.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.869
As long as it's not me, I
really don't care.

32:17.903 --> 32:18.670
My vote is Ali.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.506
Me too.

32:20.539 --> 32:23.075
And so is Chrissy.

32:23.109 --> 32:26.278
But in order to vote out j.P., I
need to make up with Ali.

32:26.312 --> 32:29.381
She trusted me a lot, and I did
backstab her.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.849
I need her to get rid of j.P.

32:30.882 --> 32:37.990
For this vote.

32:38.024 --> 32:39.591
I'm sorry.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.559
I should have told you.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.828
Yeah.

32:42.861 --> 32:44.430
That was a huge mistake.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.832
I was petrified of roark.

32:46.865 --> 32:52.304
I'm just petrified I'm going
home.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.806
I do not think that.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.941
I have your back.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.777
And I know that's incredibly
hard for you to accept right

32:58.810 --> 33:00.379
now, but that's true.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.582
After the last tribal
council, I was definitely on the

33:03.615 --> 33:05.751
outs, but I think I found my
crack.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.620
I just have to make it one more
vote until the merge, one or two

33:08.654 --> 33:09.655
at the most.

33:09.688 --> 33:11.390
Well maybe we should do j.P.

33:11.423 --> 33:12.691
He was dominant today.

33:12.724 --> 33:15.561
He's within dominant every
day.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.696
And he lays low a lot.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.231
I don't know where his head
is.

33:19.265 --> 33:20.432
That's scary.

33:20.466 --> 33:24.070
I still can't trust Ryan, but
he definitely sees j.P. Is a

33:24.103 --> 33:24.770
threat.

33:24.803 --> 33:25.971
We need Chrissy to come over.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.208
I'll talk to her first and
see what she thinks.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.709
Now I need to get with Chrissy.

33:30.742 --> 33:34.780
I know that I voted for Chrissy,
but the thing is, I know that

33:34.813 --> 33:36.215
Chrissy is a very smart person.

33:36.248 --> 33:41.720
It just doesn't make sense to
keep j.P.

33:41.753 --> 33:46.024
I think so far in this game
my downfall has been my loyalty.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.327
I think that I just put it in
the wrong person.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.531
I know I have Lauren 100%.

33:52.564 --> 33:56.302
And I know I have a great
relationship with Devon.

33:56.335 --> 34:00.072
Going forward I am loyal, and I
want the prove it to you.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.375
I was thinking this is
probably the last vote out

34:03.409 --> 34:04.643
before the merge.

34:04.676 --> 34:08.580
So it doesn't matter to me what
makes this four-man team strong.

34:08.614 --> 34:13.252
What matters to me is who can I
beat once we get to the merge.

34:13.284 --> 34:16.888
I definitely think that
j.P.'S going to go out there and

34:16.922 --> 34:17.723
strut.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.757
You see how he is.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.592
He's going the try and win
everything.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.027
Yes, yes.

34:22.060 --> 34:26.264
You know, I feel like I could
put the loyalty that I put in

34:26.297 --> 34:27.333
Ryan in you.

34:27.366 --> 34:30.302
Ali told me that she's
extremely loyal and going

34:30.335 --> 34:33.572
forward she really wants to work
together and get rid of j.P.

34:33.605 --> 34:39.077
I think that j.P. Is a threat,
but truthfully, Ali voted for me

34:39.110 --> 34:43.382
last tribal council, so I don't
know if I can even trust Ali

34:43.415 --> 34:45.583
moving forward.

34:45.617 --> 34:49.155
The one person I am most closely
aligned with is Ryan, and

34:49.188 --> 34:51.523
together we need to make the
decision on which of the two

34:51.556 --> 34:54.693
goes home tonight.

34:54.726 --> 34:58.297
I wanted to play with people
who like...

34:58.330 --> 35:00.299
Like love the game, want the
play the game.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.200
Yeah, yeah.

35:01.233 --> 35:03.802
Either way we're good.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.071
I'm is happy.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.240
I told you I wanted to play the
game with you.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.341
I know.

35:09.375 --> 35:13.945
J.P. And Ali are polar
opposites, yet concurrently they

35:13.979 --> 35:16.047
both want to work with me and
Chrissy.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.250
I don't know why everybody wants
to work with me.

35:18.284 --> 35:21.620
I think I'm a freakin' weasel,
but the closer you are to

35:21.653 --> 35:25.724
somebody, they can't really see
you go behind their back and

35:25.757 --> 35:38.437
backstab them.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.982
Jeff: So the roller coaster
continues for the soko tribe.

35:51.016 --> 35:55.053
Ryan, after the last tribal,
which was clearly a blind side,

35:55.086 --> 35:56.021
what happened back at camp.

35:56.054 --> 35:59.225
Yeah, so Ali was not pleased.

35:59.258 --> 36:02.261
You know, she had been on the
wrong side of the roark vote, so

36:02.294 --> 36:06.232
I had just told her my reasoning
behind it.

36:06.265 --> 36:10.402
I really felt roark was going to
flip back to that strong healer

36:10.436 --> 36:12.504
contingency that's still in the
game up to this point.

36:12.538 --> 36:15.374
Jeff: Ali, I'm guessing you
said, you could have told me

36:15.407 --> 36:16.174
that.

36:16.208 --> 36:18.610
Yeah, that's exactly how I
felt.

36:18.644 --> 36:22.814
If he would have told me from
the get-go, it would have been

36:22.848 --> 36:23.515
wetter.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.551
I apologized and he apologized.

36:25.584 --> 36:28.754
I think it's swept under the rug
and we can move forward now.

36:28.787 --> 36:32.057
Jeff: So Chrissy, we're
almost halfway through the game.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.960
We're getting close to that
point.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.094
What's the feeling?

36:36.127 --> 36:38.597
The feeling is we all believe
there is a merge that is

36:38.630 --> 36:41.600
imminent, and all four of us
want to make it to the merge.

36:41.633 --> 36:44.536
Clearly that's not going to
happen.

36:44.570 --> 36:47.038
Jeff: So Ali, does that
influence tonight's vote?

36:47.072 --> 36:52.043
Yeah, because once we get
into a merge, you need numbers.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.613
You need people you can trust
going forward.

36:54.646 --> 36:56.782
Not only people that will fight
for themselves but for you, as

36:56.815 --> 36:57.849
well.

36:57.883 --> 37:00.286
Jeff: J.P., that's where
you have to be a little

37:00.319 --> 37:03.154
concerned, because when you
reach the merge, then it's about

37:03.188 --> 37:04.356
getting rid of contenders.

37:04.390 --> 37:08.760
Traditionally, the bigger
guys or the guys that seem to do

37:08.794 --> 37:11.997
a little better at the
challenges tend to get voted off

37:12.030 --> 37:12.631
around this time.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.099
Why not get rid of j.P.

37:14.132 --> 37:16.234
So it's definitely a little
scary to be sitting here

37:16.268 --> 37:16.868
tonight.

37:16.902 --> 37:18.003
Jeff: So what do you do?

37:18.036 --> 37:20.238
You had to think about that
today with tribal coming

37:20.272 --> 37:21.473
tonight.

37:21.507 --> 37:23.809
You can say what you have to
say the make you case, but at

37:23.842 --> 37:27.045
the end of the day, it comes
down the what's in everybody's

37:27.078 --> 37:28.614
best interest to move their game
forward.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.850
Jeff: Ali, j.P. Gave an
interesting answer to a very

37:31.883 --> 37:32.684
specific question.

37:32.718 --> 37:34.753
By saying nothing.

37:34.786 --> 37:38.857
I don't see anybody else playing
as laid back right now as j.P.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.091
What do you read into that?

37:40.125 --> 37:44.095
Yeah, he didn't say, well, I
bring this and I bring this or

37:44.129 --> 37:47.333
what he's going to offer if he
does end up winning all these

37:47.366 --> 37:48.199
challenges.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.969
I have no idea what he's
thinking, ever.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.439
Jeff: Chrissy, surprised
that j.P. Didn't say, let me

37:53.472 --> 37:56.007
tell you why I'm not a good
person to get rid of?

37:56.041 --> 37:59.545
No, I've known j.P. Since day
one, and j.P. Plays a quiet

37:59.578 --> 38:00.746
game.

38:00.779 --> 38:04.015
Jeff: Ryan, can you
appreciate why j.P. Would be

38:04.049 --> 38:06.418
reluctant to defend himself,
because it only just shines the

38:06.452 --> 38:11.523
light brighter on the obvious
thing, he's clearly the most

38:11.557 --> 38:12.458
physical guy here.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.726
As Chrissy said, it's a very
quiet game.

38:14.760 --> 38:15.927
Sometimes that's scary, as well.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.897
If I can't have a conversation
with you and I see you at the

38:18.930 --> 38:22.534
reward challenge like basking in
the imlorry, I mean, he's not

38:22.568 --> 38:23.735
missing much.

38:23.769 --> 38:26.572
There's only a couple pieces
request for this guy to become a

38:26.605 --> 38:27.539
super player.

38:27.573 --> 38:29.508
So do I want to go against that?

38:29.541 --> 38:31.477
Do I want to work with that?

38:31.510 --> 38:32.678
It's a lot of questions.

38:32.711 --> 38:35.313
Jeff: J.P., I got to give
you credit, because through this

38:35.347 --> 38:38.917
entire tribal, you are like the
piece of granite you appear to

38:38.950 --> 38:39.985
be carved from.

38:40.018 --> 38:40.752
You have not proved.

38:40.786 --> 38:41.853
You are committed.

38:41.887 --> 38:44.823
So if it's you tonight, will you
say, this is my game.

38:44.856 --> 38:46.024
I'm fine with it?

38:46.057 --> 38:51.096
I think if I was to walk down
that path, I probably should

38:51.129 --> 38:55.734
have been more social and open
with the game.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.603
I probably should have done
that.

38:57.636 --> 39:03.375
Maybe this is a good wake-up
call for me.

39:03.409 --> 39:06.912
Jeff: Ali, is this a
reminder of how real it all is?

39:06.945 --> 39:10.148
Oh yeah, , it's the atmosphere
being here.

39:10.181 --> 39:14.720
My body is tricking me the think
I'm cold, I'm shaking.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.221
But I think it's the
nervousness.

39:16.254 --> 39:19.357
I'm in a nervous position anyway
because I was not included on

39:19.391 --> 39:20.859
the last vote.

39:20.892 --> 39:24.730
I'm still hoping that what I
think are mended relationships

39:24.763 --> 39:25.964
are really mended.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.768
We'll find out where the trust
lies when the vote is revealed.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.170
Jeff: Chrissy, you seem to
be nodding your head.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.873
It's terrible when the
numbers get small because there

39:34.906 --> 39:36.475
are no extras to vote out.

39:36.508 --> 39:40.111
With we're four great players,
all of us want this so badly, so

39:40.145 --> 39:43.248
I think that we're all just
constantly evaluating right now,

39:43.281 --> 39:45.684
who do I want to vote out.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.986
Every single person here
benefits my game and hurts my

39:48.019 --> 39:50.956
game.

39:50.989 --> 39:51.657
Jeff: All right.

39:51.690 --> 39:53.759
It is time to vote.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.963
J.P., you're up.

40:00.165 --> 40:01.500
I got my game.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.634
You got you game.

40:02.668 --> 40:10.709
See who wins.

40:10.742 --> 40:25.356
We have to get rid of the
strong.

40:25.390 --> 40:33.932
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:33.965 --> 40:37.102
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want the play it,

40:37.135 --> 40:40.872
now would be the time to do so.

40:40.906 --> 40:41.840
Okay.

40:41.873 --> 40:44.576
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.345
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal

40:47.378 --> 40:48.614
council area immediately.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.482
I'll read the votes.

40:50.516 --> 40:55.086
First vote, Ali.

40:55.120 --> 40:55.554
J.P.

40:55.587 --> 40:56.822
One vote Ali.

40:56.855 --> 41:01.560
One vote j.P.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.594
Ali.

41:02.628 --> 41:08.734
That's two votes Ali, one vote
j.P., one vote left.

41:08.767 --> 41:11.269
Sixth person voted out...

41:11.302 --> 41:12.971
You're kidding me.

41:13.004 --> 41:26.151
Ali, you need to bring me your
torch.

41:26.184 --> 41:31.557
Good luck beating him.

41:31.590 --> 41:34.359
Wow.

41:34.392 --> 41:39.397
Jeff: Ali, the tribe has
spoken.

41:39.430 --> 41:47.873
Time for you to go.

41:47.906 --> 41:51.777
Well, you're almost out of tribe
members and you are clearly

41:51.810 --> 41:53.378
counting on a merge.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.379
Good luck.

41:54.412 --> 42:00.686
Grab you torches, head back to
camp, good night.

Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes

42:09.895 --> 42:12.197
from our next episode.

42:15.233 --> 42:19.337
Jeff: Next time on
"survivor," a bomb is dropped.

42:19.370 --> 42:20.772
You are merged.

42:20.806 --> 42:23.141
[Cheering and applause]
The merge, that's what you

42:23.174 --> 42:23.742
dream of.

42:23.775 --> 42:24.810
This is the playoffs now.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.745
Jeff: The target is in
sight.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.179
Cole is the biggest threat.

42:28.213 --> 42:31.382
The battle line is drawn.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.418
He's going to flip on you
all.

42:33.451 --> 42:34.653
I expect a war.

42:34.686 --> 42:40.158
I guess I let a little twerp
like Ryan ruin my whole game,

42:40.191 --> 42:43.228
and Chrissy is the liar of all
liars.

42:43.261 --> 42:45.997
If she lies that way the rest of
the game, she's going to win.

42:46.031 --> 42:49.835
I came into this game thinking I
was going to play with my head,

42:49.868 --> 42:51.870
and maybe I did use my heart a
little bit.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.571
Maybe I trusted people too much.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.540
That's what got me.
