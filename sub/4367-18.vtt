00:01.258 --> 00:04.010
You are being watched.

00:04.011 --> 00:06.245
The government
has a secret system,

00:06.247 --> 00:10.967
a machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.269
I designed the machine to
detect acts of terror,

00:13.271 --> 00:14.971
but it sees everything,

00:14.973 --> 00:18.274
violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:18.276 --> 00:21.360
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:21.362 --> 00:23.362
We don't.

00:23.364 --> 00:28.067
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:28.069 --> 00:29.719
You will never find us.

00:29.721 --> 00:32.154
But victim or perpetrator,

00:32.156 --> 00:35.408
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:53.895 --> 00:57.963
Listen, Candi,
I just want to say...

00:57.965 --> 01:00.900
I think you're really special.

01:00.902 --> 01:02.468
Hey! What--

01:02.470 --> 01:03.736
Don't you knock?

01:03.738 --> 01:05.771
You stole our money.
We want it back.

01:05.773 --> 01:08.407
Are you the Nigerian scammers?

01:08.409 --> 01:10.976
I can't believe
you're actually Nigerian.

01:10.978 --> 01:14.330
500 bucks. Now.

01:14.332 --> 01:15.748
Candi...

01:15.750 --> 01:18.951
you set me up?
I thought we had something.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.786
Hey, come on, g-guys.

01:20.788 --> 01:24.073
It's not technically a crime
to scam a scammer!

01:24.074 --> 01:27.673
But it is a crime to cut out
a man's intestines.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.462
And make him
wear them as a hat.

01:29.464 --> 01:34.300
Wait, you plan to kill me?

01:34.302 --> 01:35.501
Probably.

01:35.503 --> 01:39.355
Okay, that's a big mistake.

01:39.357 --> 01:41.023
Yeah, you better
get out of here.

01:41.025 --> 01:42.525
Right now, while you still can.

01:45.113 --> 01:46.696
Aah!

01:50.284 --> 01:51.450
Oh!

01:51.452 --> 01:52.952
Oh, okay.
Okay.

01:52.954 --> 01:55.037
We have to stop
meeting like this.

01:55.039 --> 01:56.855
I'm always so happy to see you.

01:56.857 --> 02:00.292
Next time this happens,
Leon, I'm gonna be on vacation.

02:00.294 --> 02:03.245
I gather
that Mr. Tao is intact.

02:03.247 --> 02:05.864
- He is.
- Finchy!

02:05.866 --> 02:08.217
And seemingly unfazed
by his most recent

02:08.219 --> 02:10.086
brush with death.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.555
Are you kidding?
I'm distraught.

02:12.557 --> 02:15.057
That woman ripped out
my beating heart.

02:15.059 --> 02:16.726
Let's go get me a drink.

02:16.728 --> 02:19.011
I need to work through this.

02:19.013 --> 02:20.679
Mr. Reese,
please part ways

02:20.681 --> 02:21.880
with Leon
as quickly as possible.

02:21.882 --> 02:23.482
We've received another number.

02:23.484 --> 02:24.567
That's the best news
I've heard all day.

02:25.987 --> 02:27.186
You'll have
to leave immediately.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.404
There's some travel required.

02:28.406 --> 02:31.540
You're going to Atlantic City.

02:34.444 --> 02:36.078
All right, Finch, I'm here.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.114
So tell me
about our new number.

02:38.116 --> 02:41.417
His name is Lou Mitchell,
a retired watch repairman.

02:41.419 --> 02:43.119
He's a widower
with no children.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.155
His wife Marilyn died
of cancer six months ago.

02:46.157 --> 02:49.041
I'm sending you everything
I was able to find.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.760
Not much to go on, Finch.

02:50.762 --> 02:53.095
Like many people his age,
Lou has no cell phone,

02:53.097 --> 02:56.432
no email,
almost no digital footprint.

02:56.434 --> 02:59.185
We'll have to use
a more hands-on approach.

02:59.187 --> 03:01.887
Got him in my sights now.

03:01.889 --> 03:03.856
Hey. Hey!
Hey, you!

03:03.858 --> 03:07.276
What's a guy have to do to get
a little popcorn around here?

03:07.278 --> 03:09.645
Luck isn't on Lou's side,
Finch.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.597
Looks like he's burned
through some cash tonight.

03:11.599 --> 03:13.232
Just point me in the direction
of the pop secret.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.201
I'll make it myself, huh?

03:15.203 --> 03:17.987
Seems his game of choice
is baccarat.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.573
Ah, he enjoys the classics.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.274
It's designed to be simple.
Two hands.

03:22.276 --> 03:23.609
Player, banker.

03:23.611 --> 03:26.178
You guess which hand
adds up closest to nine.

03:26.180 --> 03:28.130
I was an international spy,
Finch.

03:28.132 --> 03:29.665
I know how to play baccarat.

03:29.667 --> 03:33.335
A natural nine.
Banker bet wins.

03:33.337 --> 03:35.471
You make my arthritis flare up.

03:35.473 --> 03:38.390
Sorry, Lou.
Better luck tomorrow.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.426
Sounds like
he's a regular, Finch.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.479
Maybe Lou has lost too much
money at the Venus Casino.

03:43.481 --> 03:45.764
We should look
into his finances.

03:45.766 --> 03:47.099
All right, let's go.
Come on, dealer.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.067
Come on, dealer.

04:03.950 --> 04:06.535
Day two.
No sign of a threat.

04:06.537 --> 04:09.588
Who would want to hurt
an old man anyway?

04:09.590 --> 04:13.759
Whoever Lou used to be,
he's all bark now.

04:13.761 --> 04:16.928
Come on, come on.
I'm growing roots here.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.265
Any luck hacking
Lou's bank account?

04:19.267 --> 04:20.548
He has no online access.

04:20.551 --> 04:25.170
I'm having to hack
his entire bank.

04:25.172 --> 04:26.805
I'm in.

04:26.807 --> 04:30.643
And it looks like
Lou's coffers are nearly empty.

04:30.645 --> 04:33.646
He withdrew almost everything
at the time of his wife's death.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.866
He's been living
on social security ever since.

04:36.868 --> 04:39.652
If he's gambling money
he doesn't have,

04:39.654 --> 04:42.071
he could be in trouble
with loan sharks.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.123
A watch repairman
without a watch

04:44.125 --> 04:45.524
and no wedding ring.

04:45.526 --> 04:48.127
Maybe he had to pawn off
all their valuables.

04:48.129 --> 04:49.628
Seems likely
that a gambling addiction

04:49.630 --> 04:52.665
is the root of the danger.

04:52.667 --> 04:57.336
Finch, I've seen hands
like Lou's before.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.505
All of his fingers were broken.

04:59.507 --> 05:02.975
My guess, a long time ago
in Atlantic City,

05:02.977 --> 05:05.594
he could have rubbed
the mob the wrong way.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.981
- Hey, Lou.
- Aw, Kelly.

05:08.983 --> 05:10.882
It's like you're pouring me
into my grave.

05:10.884 --> 05:12.935
This new stuff,
it tastes like mud.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.653
One day, Lou,
I am gonna throw you

05:14.655 --> 05:16.522
right out the front door.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.890
Face it, Kelly,
you're stuck with me.

05:18.892 --> 05:21.226
My ghost is gonna haunt
this booth until the diner

05:21.228 --> 05:23.662
crumbles to the ground.

05:23.664 --> 05:25.030
What? What?
What's the matter?

05:25.032 --> 05:26.665
The owner got
an offer on the place.

05:26.667 --> 05:29.785
That flashy casino guy, Makris,

05:29.787 --> 05:31.670
wants overflow parking
or something.

05:31.672 --> 05:34.206
Oh, God.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.624
Well, you tell him--

05:35.626 --> 05:37.176
you tell him
he's got to go through me.

05:37.178 --> 05:40.429
I'll show him
where to park his damn cars.

05:40.431 --> 05:42.548
I may have found something,
Mr. Reese.

05:42.550 --> 05:45.267
Lou's wedding announcement
in an archival copy

05:45.269 --> 05:47.886
of the <i>New York Journal.</i>

05:47.888 --> 05:51.256
1972.

05:51.258 --> 05:53.976
Anything useful?

05:53.978 --> 05:56.378
Seems that a friend
of Marilyn's gave her away

05:56.380 --> 05:57.980
at the wedding.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.815
If Lou was involved
with the mob,

05:59.817 --> 06:01.900
her parents might
not have approved.

06:01.902 --> 06:04.036
I'll ask Carter
to look into it.

06:04.038 --> 06:06.572
I'll try to determine
the extent of Lou's debts.

06:06.574 --> 06:11.109
It may be that his gambling past
is coming back to haunt him.

06:11.111 --> 06:13.879
Lou Mitchell pops up in Jersey
organized crime records

06:13.881 --> 06:16.382
in the 1970s,
got his ass handed to him.

06:16.384 --> 06:18.300
Gambling debts and arrests
got him in trouble

06:18.302 --> 06:20.052
with some wise guys.

06:20.054 --> 06:22.254
You know if those wise guys
still run that part of town?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.806
Nah, they're ancient history.

06:23.808 --> 06:25.507
But it's even worse these days.

06:25.509 --> 06:27.309
A lot of drug problems
around the Venus Casino.

06:27.311 --> 06:28.794
Narcotics tells me
they're looking into the guy

06:28.796 --> 06:30.012
who runs the place.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.764
- Thanks, Szymanski.
- You got it.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.799
Carter, I got that
disciplinary report you wanted

06:33.801 --> 06:35.300
on Detective Stills.

06:35.302 --> 06:37.469
It's just your garden variety
abuse of power.

06:37.471 --> 06:39.104
Oh.
Thanks, Terney.

06:39.106 --> 06:41.991
You got it.

06:43.643 --> 06:46.445
Joss.

06:46.447 --> 06:49.031
- Detective Beecher.
- Hey.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.817
So I was thinking,
since you didn't shoot me

06:51.819 --> 06:53.085
on the way out
to Owen Island--

06:53.087 --> 06:56.338
Yeah, you know what?
Uh, come on.

07:01.177 --> 07:02.711
Then maybe
that's your way of saying

07:02.713 --> 07:04.346
I should take you to Il Cuore.

07:04.348 --> 07:07.549
Table on the terrace?

07:07.551 --> 07:11.002
- Can I think about it?
- Mm-hmm. But think quick.

07:11.004 --> 07:15.107
I made us a reservation
Friday night.

07:15.109 --> 07:17.776
In the meantime,

07:17.778 --> 07:21.146
maybe you can help me
look into this casino.

07:25.068 --> 07:28.454
Mr. Reese, I see
you've returned to the casino.

07:28.456 --> 07:31.573
- Is Lou at the tables?
- He will be soon.

07:31.575 --> 07:33.158
To do what?
He has no money.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.160
$1,500.

07:35.162 --> 07:37.379
Tell that to the wad
of bills he just forked over

07:37.381 --> 07:38.881
to the cashier.

07:38.883 --> 07:43.585
Looks like Lou's going
further into debt.

07:43.587 --> 07:44.970
The casino attracts
regular gamblers

07:44.972 --> 07:46.221
through a loyalty card system.

07:46.223 --> 07:48.340
If we could access Lou's,

07:48.342 --> 07:51.042
it would have information
on his entire gambling history.

07:51.044 --> 07:53.479
Any way you can hack
into the system?

07:53.481 --> 07:55.564
I've been trying
since yesterday.

07:55.566 --> 07:57.683
Casinos invest heavily
in their security,

07:57.685 --> 07:59.651
and their firewalls
are of the tricky sort.

07:59.653 --> 08:02.905
But every Achilles has a heel,
and theirs is greed.

08:02.907 --> 08:05.774
Their video blackjack game
is connected to the internet

08:05.776 --> 08:09.945
so that online users
can lose money too.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.697
I'm playing against you
right now.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.650
You're not doing very well.

08:14.652 --> 08:16.702
Winning is not the goal.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.637
The game is so eager
to let me play

08:18.639 --> 08:21.640
that it's allowed my malware
to slip through.

08:21.642 --> 08:26.345
Remind me
never to cross you, Finch.

08:26.347 --> 08:29.047
Oh, don't bet against me.
Bad luck.

08:29.049 --> 08:30.849
I think
you could hold your own.

08:30.851 --> 08:33.385
I'm sending you
someone to ID, Finch.

08:33.386 --> 08:35.938
Guy acts like
he owns the place.

08:35.940 --> 08:38.440
Indeed he does.
Darien Makris.

08:38.442 --> 08:41.092
Bit of a local celebrity.
He owns the casino.

08:41.094 --> 08:43.395
Detective Carter put him
on my radar.

08:43.397 --> 08:45.314
The police have been looking
into him

08:45.316 --> 08:47.599
for cocaine distribution,
but he's never been charged.

08:47.601 --> 08:48.784
Oh, jeez, I'm sorry.

08:48.786 --> 08:51.453
Looks like
I did ruin your luck.

08:51.455 --> 08:53.622
Listen, have you
tried our slots?

08:53.624 --> 08:56.041
Come on, I'll give you
a free spin.

08:56.043 --> 08:58.577
Eric here will point you
in the right direction.

08:59.997 --> 09:03.415
Okay, I've given myself
security access,

09:03.417 --> 09:05.918
so as soon as Lou
swipes his card,

09:05.920 --> 09:09.421
I should be able to view
his history remotely.

09:11.975 --> 09:15.844
Mr. Reese, Lou's lost
nearly $2,000 a day

09:15.846 --> 09:17.980
for the last six months.

09:17.982 --> 09:20.298
Over $320,000 and counting.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.167
How does someone
on a fixed income

09:22.169 --> 09:24.136
accrue that kind of debt?

09:24.138 --> 09:26.738
The real question is,
how the hell did Lou

09:26.740 --> 09:29.942
get all that money
in the first place?

09:45.030 --> 09:49.583
Lou must be borrowing money
to gamble himself out of debt.

09:49.585 --> 09:52.837
And since he has the worst luck
I've ever seen,

09:52.839 --> 09:55.206
he's only going to make
his situation worse.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.974
But where is the money
coming from?

09:56.976 --> 09:59.043
You should check
into his old gambling pals,

09:59.045 --> 10:01.695
see if anyone is staking him.

10:01.697 --> 10:03.013
Has it occurred to you,

10:03.015 --> 10:05.866
what if Lou was
a mobster himself?

10:05.868 --> 10:08.418
What, an old mafioso in hiding?

10:08.420 --> 10:09.970
I certainly hope
that's not the case.

10:09.972 --> 10:13.023
I'll keep an eye on him.

10:13.025 --> 10:15.526
Finch...

10:15.528 --> 10:16.861
If he's dangerous--

10:16.863 --> 10:18.646
- I refuse to believe
that that old man

10:18.648 --> 10:20.698
is capable of hurting anybody.

10:20.700 --> 10:24.819
He's cantankerous,
but he's not a killer.

10:26.905 --> 10:32.460
Open up Interrogation Two
for Szymanski.

10:32.462 --> 10:34.378
Let's go.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.113
- Szymanski--
- Carter...

10:36.115 --> 10:38.448
Somebody's trying to set me up.
They planted evidence.

10:38.450 --> 10:39.717
What?

10:39.719 --> 10:41.502
Offshore accounts.
A condo in Miami.

10:41.504 --> 10:44.722
Then IAB finds this stuffed
in a pillow in my apartment.

10:44.724 --> 10:46.423
This is
an Internal Affairs matter.

10:46.425 --> 10:49.009
And this is a good cop.
What is going on here?

10:49.011 --> 10:51.562
We received a reliable tip
that turned out to be right.

10:51.564 --> 10:52.963
A tip?
From who?

10:52.965 --> 10:54.765
Somebody in narcotics
got word from a CI.

10:54.767 --> 10:56.233
Let's go, Szymanski.

10:56.235 --> 10:57.902
I'm supposed to testify today,
Carter.

10:57.904 --> 11:01.638
They're dirtying me up
to keep me off the stand.

11:01.640 --> 11:04.775
Judge, Peter Yogorov
runs the Russian mafia.

11:04.777 --> 11:06.160
He's on trial for murder.

11:06.162 --> 11:07.912
Now obviously he had
that evidence planted.

11:07.914 --> 11:09.780
It's clear-cut
witness tampering.

11:09.782 --> 11:11.999
Now I plead a continuance
until Detective Szymanski

11:12.001 --> 11:15.452
can testify.

11:19.007 --> 11:20.841
Hey.

11:20.843 --> 11:23.377
- I'll have him back in an hour.
- All right.

11:23.379 --> 11:26.931
Mr. Yogorov, I heard
the ADA lost her key witness

11:26.933 --> 11:28.349
in your trial.

11:28.351 --> 11:29.934
Lucky you.

11:29.936 --> 11:33.670
- Who the hell are you?
- Let's take a ride.

11:45.483 --> 11:48.319
Mr. Yogorov...

11:48.321 --> 11:50.638
I believe
we can help each other.

11:50.640 --> 11:54.024
You're HR, yes?

11:54.026 --> 11:55.075
I heard you guys were finished.

11:55.077 --> 11:58.329
Well, you heard wrong.

11:58.331 --> 12:01.332
I also heard
no one's ever seen the boss.

12:01.334 --> 12:04.585
Detective Szymanski
is key to your case.

12:04.587 --> 12:08.389
He did the arrest,
processed the crime scene.

12:08.391 --> 12:11.875
But now his testimony
is under scrutiny,

12:11.877 --> 12:16.146
and everything he's touched
is in question.

12:16.148 --> 12:17.982
Peter, we can make sure
that you and your brother

12:17.984 --> 12:21.685
never see the inside of
a courtroom or jail cell again.

12:21.687 --> 12:24.238
In exchange for what?

12:24.240 --> 12:27.408
Pulling strings costs money.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.027
We need cash, plain and simple.

12:30.029 --> 12:34.448
You get us back home,
we have a deal.

12:45.377 --> 12:49.463
I must say, I'm not finding
Lou difficult to tail at all.

12:49.465 --> 12:51.298
Perhaps I should have
considered a career

12:51.300 --> 12:54.584
in the clandestine arts.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.221
Any luck on your mission?

13:00.977 --> 13:02.426
I just had a little chat
with some

13:02.428 --> 13:05.112
of the more notable lowlifes
here in Jersey,

13:05.114 --> 13:08.732
and they say that all Lou's
old mob buddies are dead.

13:08.734 --> 13:10.317
Murdered?

13:10.319 --> 13:13.704
Natural causes.
Lou's the last man standing.

13:13.706 --> 13:15.823
What about Lou's finances?

13:15.825 --> 13:19.960
Is he in debt to any criminal
outfits or loan sharks?

13:19.962 --> 13:21.962
Not as far
as these guys have heard.

13:21.964 --> 13:24.748
Guess that puts us right back
where we started, huh?

13:24.750 --> 13:28.052
Mr. Reese, I think
there may be more to Lou

13:28.054 --> 13:29.720
than meets the eye.

13:29.722 --> 13:31.922
In fact, I think there may
be more to many of the gamblers

13:31.924 --> 13:33.757
we saw at the casino.

13:33.759 --> 13:37.061
Why do you say that?

13:37.063 --> 13:40.848
Several of them are
also here at the pharmacy.

13:40.850 --> 13:44.634
And it does seem strange that
Lou would pick up prescriptions

13:44.636 --> 13:47.404
two days in a row.

13:47.406 --> 13:52.359
I think I'll task an expert
to help us do a little digging.

13:52.361 --> 13:56.313
I'll do some digging too.

13:56.315 --> 13:58.532
Oh, come on, man.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.373
The pharmacy is owned
by Lionwood Enterprises.

14:06.375 --> 14:09.009
It's a shell company
if I've ever heard of one.

14:09.011 --> 14:10.878
A shell?
For whom?

14:10.880 --> 14:12.429
There are
several board members,

14:12.431 --> 14:14.798
but they're all
conveniently unreachable.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.301
I looked
into the tax paperwork,

14:17.303 --> 14:21.555
and there's one partner
left off the public listing.

14:21.557 --> 14:25.392
Does the name Darien Makris
mean anything to you?

14:25.394 --> 14:27.194
It does, indeed.
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

14:27.196 --> 14:31.014
You've been
wonderfully helpful.

14:31.016 --> 14:32.399
Hey.

14:32.401 --> 14:34.284
You're gonna tail me
around town,

14:34.286 --> 14:37.187
at least have the stones
to introduce yourself, huh?

14:37.189 --> 14:39.156
Come on. Come on.

14:39.158 --> 14:41.191
I got it.

14:41.193 --> 14:44.294
Sit.

14:44.296 --> 14:45.879
What's your name?

14:45.881 --> 14:47.081
Harold Quail.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.383
So, Harold, you wanna tell me

14:49.385 --> 14:51.535
why you've been following me
since I left my house

14:51.537 --> 14:54.505
this morning?

14:54.507 --> 14:56.473
I'm with the IRS,
Mr. Mitchell.

14:56.475 --> 14:58.708
I'm looking
into the Venus Casino.

14:58.710 --> 15:01.228
I was hoping to ask you
a few questions.

15:01.230 --> 15:04.098
- Am I in trouble?
- Not with me.

15:04.100 --> 15:07.901
But I have reason to believe
that you might need some help.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.005
Where did you
get all the money?

15:12.007 --> 15:15.192
You want answers out of me,
you have to earn them.

15:15.194 --> 15:16.410
Baccarat.

15:16.412 --> 15:20.497
One answer per hand.

15:20.499 --> 15:21.999
From what I've seen,
Mr. Mitchell,

15:22.001 --> 15:23.500
you're not that lucky.

15:23.502 --> 15:26.003
Well, this should
go well for you. Bet.

15:26.005 --> 15:28.255
Player.

15:29.591 --> 15:31.291
7 on player, 9 on banker.

15:31.293 --> 15:32.676
Too bad.

15:32.678 --> 15:36.513
Looks like
you owe me an answer.

15:36.515 --> 15:38.799
Why do you think I need help?

15:38.801 --> 15:41.969
You've lost $320,000
in the last six months.

15:41.971 --> 15:44.621
I imagine you are
in very serious debt.

15:44.623 --> 15:46.690
No, no, no.
House rules.

15:46.692 --> 15:48.776
I'm dealing.

15:48.778 --> 15:51.111
Banker.

15:51.929 --> 15:53.730
Oh, tough luck.

15:53.732 --> 15:56.150
How do you know
I'm not independently wealthy?

15:56.152 --> 15:59.769
Because I've seen your taxes
and your credit reports.

15:59.771 --> 16:02.072
Player.

16:05.627 --> 16:07.244
This is not your day, Harold.

16:07.246 --> 16:09.213
You lose again.

16:09.215 --> 16:10.464
What?

16:10.466 --> 16:12.132
Are you calling me
a cheater, Harold?

16:12.134 --> 16:14.585
No one likes a sore loser.

16:14.587 --> 16:18.005
Mr. Mitchell, I believe
that you may be in grave danger.

16:18.007 --> 16:19.673
Let me help you.

16:19.675 --> 16:24.645
When people need help,
they think, "call the IRS."

16:25.630 --> 16:27.264
This guy's got the check!

16:27.266 --> 16:29.399
Mr. Mitchell,
please, I...

16:29.401 --> 16:30.800
Here you go, hon.

16:30.802 --> 16:32.603
Thank you.

16:32.605 --> 16:35.639
Hey, you like seafood?

16:37.809 --> 16:38.992
Go fish.

16:38.994 --> 16:43.113
Oh, dear.

16:49.821 --> 16:52.122
Got eyes on Lou, Finch.

16:52.124 --> 16:55.425
But where are you?

16:55.427 --> 16:58.595
I decided to return
to the library.

16:58.597 --> 17:00.430
Decided?

17:00.432 --> 17:02.216
Lou gave you the slip,
didn't he?

17:02.218 --> 17:05.001
When he deposited my keys
in a tank full of crustaceans,

17:05.002 --> 17:06.720
I got the distinct impression

17:06.722 --> 17:08.222
that he didn't appreciate
being followed.

17:08.223 --> 17:10.357
And, Mr. Reese,
Lou is much luckier

17:10.358 --> 17:12.358
outside the walls
of the casino.

17:12.361 --> 17:14.278
I think he's throwing
those games at the Venus,

17:14.280 --> 17:16.363
but I can't imagine
why he would intentionally lose

17:16.365 --> 17:19.031
his own money.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.484
Didn't you like the slots?

17:21.487 --> 17:23.537
Oh, no, you know,
it's the same old thing

17:23.539 --> 17:24.788
over and over again.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.574
I thought I'd try the tables.

17:27.576 --> 17:31.027
Mr. Reese, that lady
with the bouffant,

17:31.029 --> 17:33.046
she's losing money
at the same rate Lou is.

17:33.048 --> 17:35.031
- So?
- She's been doing it longer.

17:35.033 --> 17:37.751
She's down $405,000.

17:37.753 --> 17:40.287
And the woman with
the fondness for tanning oil,

17:40.289 --> 17:42.923
$261,000.

17:42.925 --> 17:45.142
All of these people
that we see with Lou,

17:45.144 --> 17:47.394
they've lost enormous sums
of money.

17:47.396 --> 17:49.146
That's more than a coincidence.

17:49.148 --> 17:50.931
There must be a reason
why they're doing that.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.883
You think they're losing
intentionally as well?

17:53.885 --> 17:55.485
Why?

17:55.487 --> 17:57.654
Perhaps we should ask the man
who owns both the casino

17:57.656 --> 17:58.906
and the pharmacy.

17:58.908 --> 18:00.324
Makris.

18:00.326 --> 18:01.858
If the police are right
and Makris is running

18:01.860 --> 18:04.111
a drug operation,
he needs to launder dirty money.

18:04.113 --> 18:07.197
He's using senior citizens
as couriers.

18:07.199 --> 18:08.415
They lose the money
at the tables,

18:08.417 --> 18:09.833
and it gets laundered

18:09.835 --> 18:11.868
into the casino's cash pool
every day.

18:11.870 --> 18:13.537
The police wouldn't think twice
about old people

18:13.539 --> 18:15.172
losing money at a casino.

18:15.174 --> 18:17.925
You know what else
the police would never suspect?

18:17.927 --> 18:22.078
An old person
picking up a prescription.

18:27.936 --> 18:30.587
Finch...

18:30.589 --> 18:33.807
the pharmacy is a dead drop.

18:33.809 --> 18:36.092
Makris has got a whole stable
of money mules

18:36.094 --> 18:37.611
transporting cash for him.

18:37.613 --> 18:40.981
These aren't
exactly drug lords.

18:40.983 --> 18:45.385
Safe bet, Makris
is forcing them to do this.

18:45.387 --> 18:47.621
But Lou's is
the only number that came up.

18:47.623 --> 18:49.406
Why is he in more danger
than the others?

18:49.408 --> 18:52.659
Maybe because he's skimming
off the laundered money.

18:56.664 --> 18:58.915
And if Makris has found out,

18:58.917 --> 19:03.003
I bet he'd kill anyone
to protect his investment.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.583
Detective Szymanski,

19:20.585 --> 19:22.685
did you talk to Anthony Marconi
two nights ago?

19:22.687 --> 19:25.355
- No. Absolutely not.
- No?

19:25.357 --> 19:27.690
Then when was the last time
you guys talked?

19:27.692 --> 19:29.976
The last time
I talked to that guy,

19:29.978 --> 19:31.594
his men shot me.

19:31.596 --> 19:33.229
It's bad business.

19:33.231 --> 19:38.451
Cal, the tip came in
from Narcotics about Szymanski.

19:38.453 --> 19:41.454
Do you know who made the call?

19:41.456 --> 19:42.939
The star witness...

19:45.710 --> 19:46.709
Look, Joss--

19:46.711 --> 19:49.996
It was you?

19:49.998 --> 19:51.414
Who's your CI?

19:51.416 --> 19:52.749
You know I can't tell you that.

19:52.751 --> 19:54.116
Like hell you can't.

19:54.118 --> 19:55.668
You think I enjoy
taking another cop down?

19:55.670 --> 19:58.154
The evidence speaks for itself.

19:58.156 --> 20:03.176
Then I guess
there's nothing else to say.

20:04.261 --> 20:05.962
- Hey, Carter.
- Yeah.

20:05.964 --> 20:08.398
I called one of the guys
Stills reported at the 51st--

20:08.400 --> 20:10.099
- Can we talk later, Terney?
- Sure, sure.

20:10.101 --> 20:13.236
Okay, thanks.

20:13.238 --> 20:15.271
I need you to tell me
the truth about something.

20:15.273 --> 20:18.641
There's no Santa.
It was your parents.

20:18.643 --> 20:20.944
I'm serious, Fusco.

20:20.946 --> 20:23.246
It's about Beecher.

20:23.248 --> 20:27.951
Have you ever heard
anything about him?

20:29.954 --> 20:33.122
Carter, you and I put
a bunch of dirty cops away.

20:33.124 --> 20:37.360
But trust me on this,
HR's not gone.

20:37.362 --> 20:38.995
Not by a long shot.

20:38.997 --> 20:42.432
Anybody could be on the take.

20:42.434 --> 20:47.169
As far as Beecher,
I don't know.

20:47.171 --> 20:50.440
But if you follow that money
they found on Szymanski,

20:50.442 --> 20:54.677
you might not
like what you find.

21:03.454 --> 21:05.822
Ah, you burned through
those chips fast today, Lou.

21:05.824 --> 21:08.190
You're killing me,
Jen, killing me.

21:08.192 --> 21:12.194
Better luck tomorrow.

21:13.797 --> 21:17.717
Hey, old man.
Got that popcorn you wanted.

21:17.719 --> 21:20.336
- Out of my way.
- Sorry, gramps.

21:20.338 --> 21:23.473
You've been skimming
from the boss.

21:29.013 --> 21:31.264
We gotta get you
away from here.

21:31.266 --> 21:33.215
You can trust me.
I'm with--

21:33.217 --> 21:34.717
- Harold?

21:34.719 --> 21:38.154
Yeah, I figured.

21:38.156 --> 21:41.074
So I guess you're not
really with the IRS, huh?

21:41.076 --> 21:44.193
Is it that obvious?

21:44.195 --> 21:48.614
Now I think you
owe Harold some answers.

21:48.616 --> 21:50.416
Yeah.

21:50.418 --> 21:52.919
You want to tell me
who you really are?

21:52.921 --> 21:54.403
That's not important.

21:54.405 --> 21:56.072
But when I said
we want to help you,

21:56.074 --> 21:59.375
that was the truth.

21:59.377 --> 22:04.464
Why are you working for Makris?

22:04.466 --> 22:06.632
My Marilyn got cancer.

22:06.634 --> 22:08.801
Really advanced.

22:08.803 --> 22:12.438
Only hope we had
was a stem cell treatment.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.390
We didn't have enough
to cover it.

22:14.392 --> 22:15.892
I had to improvise.

22:15.894 --> 22:18.027
So you went to the casino.

22:18.029 --> 22:21.481
I was right, wasn't I?

22:21.483 --> 22:25.201
That's like calling
a white truffle athlete's foot.

22:25.203 --> 22:28.571
I'm the best damn card mechanic
in Atlantic City.

22:28.573 --> 22:30.540
So you got the money.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.942
Yeah, and the treatment.

22:32.944 --> 22:38.414
But sometimes,
your luck just runs out.

22:38.416 --> 22:42.502
A few days after Marilyn passed,
Makris got his hands

22:42.504 --> 22:46.122
on an old list of card sharps.

22:46.124 --> 22:47.807
He saw your name on the list,
and he came around,

22:47.809 --> 22:49.175
asking for his money back,

22:49.177 --> 22:51.511
but of course
you didn't have it.

22:51.513 --> 22:52.979
So he takes your wedding ring

22:52.981 --> 22:54.847
and Marilyn's jewelry
as collateral,

22:54.849 --> 22:57.567
and he puts you to work
laundering money.

22:57.569 --> 23:00.269
Said it would just
be a couple of months.

23:00.271 --> 23:02.605
I get a feeling
this is a lifetime gig.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.574
So is that
why you started skimming?

23:04.576 --> 23:05.808
I lose everything
he tells me to,

23:05.810 --> 23:07.410
so what if I win a little back?

23:07.412 --> 23:10.363
Clearly Makris
sees it differently.

23:10.365 --> 23:13.216
Lou, I'm not going to let him
come after you ever again.

23:13.218 --> 23:14.617
Yeah?

23:14.619 --> 23:17.486
In the meantime,

23:17.488 --> 23:20.623
it would be best
if you left town.

23:20.625 --> 23:23.626
Here's a ticket, enough money
to keep you comfortable.

23:23.628 --> 23:26.946
There's a lovely place
waiting for you in Chicago.

23:26.948 --> 23:29.132
I can't leave Marilyn.

23:29.134 --> 23:31.217
There's a plot for me
right next to her.

23:31.219 --> 23:33.219
It's got my name on it
and everything.

23:33.221 --> 23:36.672
Lou, I know
exactly how difficult it is

23:36.674 --> 23:41.343
to have to leave
someone behind.

23:41.345 --> 23:45.531
You lost someone too?

23:45.533 --> 23:48.451
I had to move on.

23:48.453 --> 23:52.238
So must you.

23:52.240 --> 23:56.959
40 years ago,
the mob caught me sharping.

23:56.961 --> 24:00.046
Beat me all to hell,
broke all my fingers.

24:00.048 --> 24:02.215
Left me for dead.

24:02.217 --> 24:03.699
A waitress found me
in a dumpster

24:03.701 --> 24:07.170
behind the diner.

24:07.172 --> 24:08.387
Marilyn.

24:08.389 --> 24:10.673
I was ready to give up.

24:10.675 --> 24:14.376
But she gave me something
to live for, you know?

24:14.378 --> 24:16.846
Because of her,
I gave up gambling.

24:16.848 --> 24:20.216
I used these hands
to fix watches instead.

24:20.218 --> 24:23.102
She saved me, Harold.

24:23.104 --> 24:27.890
And she'd want you
to save yourself now.

24:31.562 --> 24:34.864
Chicago will be cold.

24:47.511 --> 24:49.795
Don't worry, Lou, my associate
will make sure Makris thinks

24:49.797 --> 24:52.098
you've been eliminated.

24:52.100 --> 24:54.684
So you think
I'll be able to come back?

24:54.686 --> 24:59.388
Maybe.
Eventually.

24:59.390 --> 25:05.144
At my age, there's
not much eventually left.

25:17.374 --> 25:18.824
Lou's safe for now,

25:18.826 --> 25:20.276
but Makris will never stop
looking for him.

25:20.278 --> 25:21.911
He knows too much.

25:21.913 --> 25:23.963
And we can't abandon
all the other elderly people

25:23.965 --> 25:26.999
under Makris's thumb.

25:27.001 --> 25:30.052
Do we have the evidence
to put him behind bars?

25:30.054 --> 25:31.804
Unfortunately, no.

25:31.806 --> 25:34.173
Money launderers
keep two sets of books.

25:34.175 --> 25:36.058
The cooked numbers
you show the IRS

25:36.060 --> 25:38.978
and the real books to keep track
of your extralegal gains.

25:38.980 --> 25:40.680
At the moment,

25:40.682 --> 25:44.183
those books
are beyond my reach.

25:44.185 --> 25:48.271
Well, what would we need
to get them within your reach?

25:48.273 --> 25:50.856
A distraction.

25:52.993 --> 25:54.493
Here you are, sir.

25:54.495 --> 25:57.330
Thank you.

25:57.332 --> 25:59.582
There was a stripper pole
in that thing.

25:59.584 --> 26:02.368
I feel weirdly grimy.

26:02.370 --> 26:06.088
So this guy's dealing drugs?

26:06.090 --> 26:07.673
That's putting it mildly.

26:07.675 --> 26:09.542
Based on the financial
information I've seen,

26:09.544 --> 26:13.012
he's laundering profits
on the order of eight figures.

26:13.014 --> 26:16.015
Wow.
I'm jealous.

26:16.017 --> 26:18.918
Angry.
I'm angry.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.186
He must be stopped.

26:20.188 --> 26:21.721
Indeed.
Ergo, you are now

26:21.723 --> 26:25.858
Jason Bao, playboy millionaire.

26:25.860 --> 26:27.560
Welcome to the Venus,
Mr. Bao.

26:27.562 --> 26:32.064
- Thank you, sir.
- Right this way.

26:32.066 --> 26:34.183
When a high roller
starts betting big,

26:34.185 --> 26:36.535
Makris and his security
pay attention.

26:36.537 --> 26:40.706
If they're all looking at you,
they won't be watching us.

26:46.130 --> 26:48.297
That's it, right up here.

26:50.668 --> 26:52.168
How much is this?

26:52.170 --> 26:54.837
$1 million, as you requested.

26:54.839 --> 26:57.089
Can we get
some tequila shots, please?

26:57.091 --> 26:59.809
- Right away.
- Absolutely.

26:59.811 --> 27:01.644
A million?

27:01.646 --> 27:03.763
You trust Leon
with that much of your money?

27:03.765 --> 27:05.097
Absolutely not, but I'm afraid

27:05.099 --> 27:09.402
it's the cost
of doing business.

27:09.404 --> 27:12.238
Whoo!
Oh, wow!

27:24.868 --> 27:26.235
Good luck.

27:26.237 --> 27:30.039
Luck?
Merely a construct, Mr. Reese.

27:41.017 --> 27:44.053
Ah, found the casino's servers.
This shouldn't take long.

27:44.055 --> 27:47.723
Let Leon have
a little fun at least.

28:22.810 --> 28:25.794
Finch, I thought
you sent Lou out of town.

28:25.796 --> 28:27.513
I did.

28:27.515 --> 28:29.631
Well, not far enough.
He's back.

28:29.633 --> 28:33.469
And it looks like he's gambling
every chip he's ever skimmed.

28:35.439 --> 28:37.473
Player bet wins.

28:37.475 --> 28:39.942
Does he have any idea
what he's doing?

28:39.944 --> 28:41.861
Makris thinks he's dead.

28:41.863 --> 28:44.480
Makris is not gonna like it
when he sees a dead guy

28:44.482 --> 28:46.815
winning his money.

29:00.327 --> 29:04.297
Someone would
like a word. Now.

29:10.337 --> 29:13.089
Look, I'll pay you back
for the ticket.

29:13.091 --> 29:16.009
Lou, we're accessing
Makris's personal files

29:16.011 --> 29:17.927
in search of the proof we need
to put him away.

29:17.929 --> 29:20.463
We can't do that and protect you
at the same time.

29:20.465 --> 29:22.482
I made a promise, Harold.

29:22.484 --> 29:25.268
To Marilyn,
right before she passed.

29:25.270 --> 29:30.857
She grabbed my arm.
She knew what I was thinking.

29:30.859 --> 29:35.862
That-- that maybe
I'd, you know, join her.

29:35.864 --> 29:37.497
And she told me
she didn't save my life,

29:37.499 --> 29:40.816
so I could throw it away.

29:40.818 --> 29:42.168
And you haven't.

29:42.170 --> 29:45.171
Laundering drug money?
That's a living?

29:45.173 --> 29:47.924
And now to just run away?

29:47.926 --> 29:52.261
No. No, I'm taking back
every dime I put in his pocket.

29:52.263 --> 29:53.880
Please.

29:53.882 --> 29:58.935
I don't want to die a loser.

29:58.937 --> 30:00.836
Very well.

30:00.838 --> 30:02.522
Then if we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do it right.

30:02.524 --> 30:06.842
I think you can take Makris
for more than the 320,000.

30:08.029 --> 30:09.395
But to win big,
you have to bet big.

30:09.397 --> 30:11.514
So I'm staking you.

30:11.516 --> 30:13.866
And you'd better be as good
as you say you are.

30:28.882 --> 30:33.586
$2 million, Mr. Mitchell.
Good luck.

30:41.878 --> 30:44.564
Natural nine.
Player bet wins.

30:44.566 --> 30:47.550
The more he wins, Mr. Reese,
the more attention he'll get.

30:47.552 --> 30:50.653
You'll have
to keep close watch on him.

30:59.079 --> 31:03.366
Finch, hurry up
and get those documents.

31:17.247 --> 31:19.632
Pardon me.

31:38.334 --> 31:40.245
_

31:44.408 --> 31:46.459
The goons you sent to kill Lou,

31:46.461 --> 31:49.045
they're in the trunk
of a taxi headed to Vermont.

31:49.047 --> 31:51.464
You think that's gonna stop me?

31:51.466 --> 31:53.115
Mr. Reese,
I've found the real books.

31:53.117 --> 31:54.801
I'm emailing them to you now.

31:56.287 --> 31:57.970
Your security will play nice,

31:57.972 --> 32:01.808
or the IRS and the FBI
will see this.

32:04.144 --> 32:07.563
You're gonna let him play.

32:30.323 --> 32:33.364
_

32:41.014 --> 32:43.299
Whoo!

32:43.384 --> 32:45.384
_

32:45.385 --> 32:48.187
I'm finished.

32:48.189 --> 32:49.839
Where's Leon?

32:49.841 --> 32:52.675
You remind me of a girl...

32:52.677 --> 32:54.009
Candi.

32:58.199 --> 33:00.349
Have you ever
considered pink hair?

33:24.541 --> 33:27.977
$20,320,000.

33:27.979 --> 33:29.762
Direct deposit.

33:29.764 --> 33:32.381
Louis Mitchell.

33:32.383 --> 33:35.234
Mr. Makris.

33:37.571 --> 33:41.824
Congratulations,
Mr. Mitchell.

33:41.825 --> 33:45.353
_

34:03.580 --> 34:07.082
I can't believe it.
I thought I was gonna die.

34:08.268 --> 34:10.770
Finch, we're out.
Finch?

34:10.772 --> 34:12.938
Is that his name?

34:12.940 --> 34:17.360
We found your friend Finch.

34:17.362 --> 34:19.929
And Mr. Bao.

34:19.931 --> 34:23.532
You can't run a casino without
being able to spot a fake.

34:26.485 --> 34:28.070
I was gonna do this quietly,

34:28.072 --> 34:32.742
but now
we're gonna have some fun.

34:56.025 --> 35:00.079
Lou, I had such
a nice surprise the other day.

35:00.081 --> 35:02.782
A dealer told me that
your luck had finally turned.

35:02.784 --> 35:05.285
You walked away $500 up.

35:05.287 --> 35:09.789
And that's when I realized
you've been skimming.

35:09.791 --> 35:13.843
Tens of thousands of dollars,
right under my nose.

35:13.845 --> 35:15.178
Listen--

35:15.180 --> 35:18.431
All you had to do
was lose, old man.

35:18.433 --> 35:19.849
So before you die,

35:19.851 --> 35:22.352
I'm gonna make you realize

35:22.354 --> 35:25.471
that you are a loser.

35:25.473 --> 35:28.858
And that's all
you're ever gonna be.

35:31.979 --> 35:33.813
You like games, right, Lou?

35:33.815 --> 35:35.982
Huh?

35:35.984 --> 35:38.201
Roulette's my favorite.

35:38.203 --> 35:41.404
It's just you versus the wheel.

35:41.406 --> 35:47.076
You may skate by
for a spin or two.

35:47.078 --> 35:52.131
But in the end,
the house always wins.

35:52.133 --> 35:53.800
I'll give you
all the money back, just don't--

35:53.802 --> 35:55.335
just stop this.
Just stop it.

35:58.006 --> 35:59.722
Oh, he's safe.

35:59.724 --> 36:02.091
For now.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.845
Come on, man.
You gotta save me.

36:05.847 --> 36:08.348
That's your thing!

36:10.151 --> 36:13.269
Not him either.

36:16.523 --> 36:21.411
The odds are getting worse.

36:21.413 --> 36:25.031
Sometimes your luck
just runs out.

36:37.845 --> 36:39.095
Hey, dumbass...

36:39.097 --> 36:42.882
I cheated.

36:59.868 --> 37:03.369
It's not like
I'm still crying over Candi.

37:03.371 --> 37:07.123
But it's always the same story,
you know?

37:07.125 --> 37:08.624
You find a girl you like.

37:08.626 --> 37:11.610
She's tall, she's pretty,

37:11.612 --> 37:14.914
and it turns out
someone paid her to handcuff you

37:14.916 --> 37:18.217
to a bed,
so they could murder you.

37:18.219 --> 37:19.919
Same old story.

37:19.921 --> 37:23.506
I gotta learn
to protect myself.

37:23.508 --> 37:27.844
Maybe protect other people
like you guys.

37:27.846 --> 37:30.229
That sounds like a great plan.

37:30.231 --> 37:33.299
I'm turning over
a new leaf, dude.

37:35.736 --> 37:38.654
What?

37:43.444 --> 37:47.363
Saving people costs money!

37:50.317 --> 37:51.617
Carter.

37:51.619 --> 37:53.252
What's the rush?

37:53.254 --> 37:56.589
I think Szymanski was set up.

37:56.591 --> 37:58.257
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:58.259 --> 38:02.378
Oh, Fusco, you were right
about following the money.

38:02.380 --> 38:03.713
You know those marked bills

38:03.715 --> 38:05.515
IAB found in Szymanski's place?

38:05.517 --> 38:08.551
Well, the FBI placed them
in a bodega run by Elias.

38:08.553 --> 38:11.137
Six days later,
NYPD did a raid there,

38:11.139 --> 38:13.473
but the marked bills
never showed up in evidence.

38:13.475 --> 38:15.174
They just disappeared.

38:15.176 --> 38:17.443
So either Elias moved the money

38:17.445 --> 38:19.779
or someone on the force
grabbed it,

38:19.781 --> 38:23.849
giving HR a perfect way
to set up a good cop.

38:23.851 --> 38:26.402
Wow, Carter,
that's real police work.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.571
That should be enough
to get IAB off his back.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.206
It was definitely enough
to get him out on bail

38:30.208 --> 38:31.824
by the end of the day.

38:31.826 --> 38:34.494
And it should let him
testify against the Yogorovs.

38:36.030 --> 38:37.578
Carter.

38:37.579 --> 38:38.809
_

38:38.833 --> 38:40.533
Yeah?

38:40.535 --> 38:43.386
This means someone
does have it out for Szymanski.

38:43.388 --> 38:44.921
You watch your back.

38:44.923 --> 38:46.889
You don't want them
turning on you next.

39:02.322 --> 39:05.691
Thank you.

39:05.693 --> 39:08.160
I understand your winnings
are tied up as evidence.

39:08.162 --> 39:10.229
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter.

39:10.231 --> 39:12.748
As long as it
keeps Makris locked up.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.618
You know,
your poker face needs work.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.788
You had plans for that money.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.456
I figured out
why you skimmed all that cash,

39:20.458 --> 39:22.008
what you wanted to buy.

39:22.010 --> 39:23.759
What's that?

39:23.761 --> 39:27.680
A diner.

39:27.682 --> 39:29.599
That's you and Marilyn,
isn't it?

39:29.601 --> 39:33.436
Yeah, this place was
a home to us for 40 years,

39:33.438 --> 39:35.721
but the owner kept
threatening to shut it down.

39:35.723 --> 39:37.557
I wanted to keep it alive.

39:37.559 --> 39:39.308
But now that Makris's offer
is off the table,

39:39.310 --> 39:40.526
problem solved.

39:40.528 --> 39:41.894
Until another offer
comes along.

39:41.896 --> 39:46.315
Yeah, well,
nothing lasts forever.

39:46.317 --> 39:51.153
I've been meaning
to have someone look at this.

39:53.624 --> 39:57.710
That's a $2-million watch.

39:57.712 --> 39:58.911
It was.

39:58.913 --> 40:00.463
Unfortunately, I stepped on it.

40:00.465 --> 40:04.000
If someone was interested
in repairing it...

40:09.673 --> 40:13.759
You know, your wife,
the one you lost.

40:13.761 --> 40:15.094
She lost a good man.

40:15.096 --> 40:18.431
She's smiling down
on you right now.

40:22.102 --> 40:23.235
Wait.

40:23.237 --> 40:26.489
You mean she's not dead?

40:26.491 --> 40:29.642
You know, for a genius,
you're an idiot.

40:29.644 --> 40:31.827
It's too late, Lou.

40:31.829 --> 40:35.781
You're still breathing.
It's not too late!

40:35.783 --> 40:36.999
Go to her, Harold.

40:37.001 --> 40:40.819
Today, while you
still have time.

40:43.508 --> 40:46.676
_

40:52.500 --> 40:55.551
You all right?

40:55.553 --> 40:58.187
I heard what Lou said to you.

40:58.189 --> 41:00.272
Oh.

41:00.274 --> 41:02.775
You were listening?

41:02.777 --> 41:05.111
Always.

41:05.113 --> 41:08.898
You did what you had to do
to keep her safe, Harold.

41:12.035 --> 41:14.704
Lou doesn't know that.

41:14.706 --> 41:17.740
But I do.

41:17.742 --> 41:19.959
And if I were to return
to my old life,

41:19.961 --> 41:23.329
it would eventually
cost Grace hers.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.534
Some of us
don't get to grow old

41:28.536 --> 41:32.238
with the one we love.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.257
You ask me,
Lou's the luckiest guy I know.

41:35.259 --> 41:39.011
I'll grow old with her,
Mr. Reese, just from afar.

41:39.013 --> 41:41.480
And beyond that,

41:41.482 --> 41:45.851
it's best not
to think about it.

42:16.145 --> 42:17.564
_

42:18.770 --> 42:19.935
Who is this?

42:19.937 --> 42:21.887
Tell your boss the deal's off.

42:21.889 --> 42:23.472
They didn't drop the case.

42:23.474 --> 42:25.424
The ADA just
added more charges.

42:25.426 --> 42:26.892
Witness tampering.

42:26.894 --> 42:29.061
I should have known
not to trust an old man.

42:29.063 --> 42:30.763
You know, Yogorov,

42:30.765 --> 42:33.733
you really ought to have
more faith in my boss.

42:33.735 --> 42:37.119
As you know,
the mayor is very invested

42:37.121 --> 42:39.789
in this case
against the Yogorovs.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.374
So he's asked me,
his chief of staff,

42:42.376 --> 42:44.943
to ensure that the case
is moving forward,

42:44.945 --> 42:46.545
despite recent setbacks.

42:46.547 --> 42:49.799
These charges against
Detective Szymanski have HR

42:49.801 --> 42:51.584
written all over them.

42:51.586 --> 42:53.619
We've been working on this case
against the Russian mafia

42:53.621 --> 42:55.087
for nearly a decade.

42:55.089 --> 42:57.790
We are not gonna let
the Yogorovs go anywhere.

42:57.792 --> 43:00.593
They can't intimidate us,
and they can't stop us.

43:00.595 --> 43:02.845
We're gonna put
the Yogorov brothers away

43:02.847 --> 43:05.731
until their grandkids
can't remember their names.

43:08.853 --> 43:12.688
Exactly what I want to hear.

43:22.916 --> 43:26.502
Detective Terney...

43:26.504 --> 43:28.954
are we clear on the story?

43:28.956 --> 43:32.842
Shooter ran out the back?

43:35.995 --> 43:36.995
Right shoulder.

43:36.997 --> 43:40.165
You got it, boss.
