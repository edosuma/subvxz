00:27.728 --> 00:29.593
Check out Heidi
and Spencer over here.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.391
Oh, someone is not pleased

00:32.566 --> 00:36.002
with his choice of interior
on the new 7 Series.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.734
- Got a runner.
- Pickpocket?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.309
You've lost him.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.712
Try in the parking level.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.021
There.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.717
Frank, situation on B-level,
two guys.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.416
On it.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.893
- I don't see them.
- Maybe they went up.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.138
Oh, my God.

01:19.313 --> 01:21.178
Frank, status?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.612
- Clothes.
- Never a good idea.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.840
Why not?

01:57.017 --> 01:59.986
Ever had a friend, family member
get you clothes?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.480
Definitely not clothes.

02:02.790 --> 02:03.814
Jewelry?

02:03.991 --> 02:06.824
Jewelry's special, sends a message
of intimacy between two people.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.392
And who doesn't love intimacy?

02:08.595 --> 02:11.530
Especially the intimate kind
of intimacy.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.968
- Wait, who are we talking about?
- Maybe not jewelry.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.800
- Somebody want to help me out here?
- Hetty's birthday.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.533
Every year it's the same deal,
doesn't want a gift or a party.

02:23.744 --> 02:26.144
So every year you give her a gift
and throw her a party.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.791
- Of course.
- What if she doesn't want one?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.612
What if she says
she doesn't, really does?

02:29.817 --> 02:32.047
- Her feelings could be hurt.
- Exactly.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.846
She's gonna be really angry
if she actually doesn't and you do.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.647
Exactly.

02:36.824 --> 02:39.019
Come on, G.,
you know Hetty better than anyone.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.716
And birthdays are complicated.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.896
And so is Hetty.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.058
Sorry, guys.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.562
What about clothes?

02:49.236 --> 02:50.897
Yeah.

03:08.555 --> 03:10.182
Nell's been here less than a week

03:10.357 --> 03:11.915
and already taking over
whistle duties?

03:12.159 --> 03:13.387
Eric is not a happy camper.

03:13.560 --> 03:14.584
He shouldn't worry.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.424
It won't be long before she's folded
her tent like all the others.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.463
- Because?
- The many mysteries of Hetty.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.432
For some reason intelligence analysts
just seem to rub her the wrong way.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.738
Corporal Thomas Porter,
stationed out of Camp Pendleton.

03:26.907 --> 03:29.068
Security guard discovered his body.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.076
It was in the parking garage
of the Beverly Hills Rodeo Collection.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.614
Mini-mall of the rich and famous.

03:36.784 --> 03:37.944
Long way from Pendleton.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.746
It's a long way from a Pendleton
corporal's pay grade.

03:41.688 --> 03:45.556
The hand was severed at the wrist
and it's missing.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.820
What's not is his watch, car keys
and wallet which was full of...

03:48.996 --> 03:50.588
Cash and credit cards.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.756
Beverly Hills P.D.
Is working up forensics.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.494
- So obviously robbery's not a motive.
- Why us, Hetty?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.139
Corporal Porter
was an administrative clerk

04:01.308 --> 04:03.742
in Camp Pendleton's G-2 office.

04:03.911 --> 04:08.712
Everyone in that office has top secret
security clearance, even clerks.

04:15.355 --> 04:20.349
I was just getting to that, Ms. Jones.
But thank you.

04:20.527 --> 04:25.590
Director Vance wants us to pay special
attention to Corporal Porter's death.

04:25.799 --> 04:28.359
Make sure
we haven't been compromised.

04:28.535 --> 04:32.699
And Beverly Hills P.D. Has agreed
that we'll take the lead in this.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.238
Security cam footage?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.205
Security guards saw a man
we believe is our killer,

04:37.377 --> 04:40.835
and then shortly after he and another
man were in a struggle in the garage

04:41.048 --> 04:43.141
just a few minutes
before they found Porter's body.

04:43.317 --> 04:45.808
But it's too quick
to get anything useful.

04:45.986 --> 04:49.319
- Took his hand for a reason.
- Porter worked in intelligence.

04:49.490 --> 04:53.153
Maybe his prints get him access
to sensitive material.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.324
Very possible.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.624
What else do we have
besides Porter's intel specialty?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.832
Single, lives on base housing.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.903
Enlisted four years ago
out of Orange County.

05:06.073 --> 05:08.837
He completed a tour in Iraq
just a few weeks ago.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.705
His civilian and military records
are clean.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.676
Porter's C.O.
Is doing an intelligence audit

05:13.847 --> 05:16.213
to determine if there's any sensitive
material missing.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.248
And Beverly Hills P.D.
Did a phone interview

05:18.418 --> 05:21.353
which produced two people
worth talking to.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.555
PFC James Winston
was in his unit.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.353
Something wonky
was going on between them.

05:27.528 --> 05:30.656
And then there's Corporal Andrew
Peterson, Porter's best friend.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.230
He works in the motor pool.

05:32.866 --> 05:36.029
Deeks, Kensi,
work with Beverly Hills P.D. Forensics.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.304
I understand you're a tea drinker.

05:44.578 --> 05:48.036
"There is no trouble
so great or grave

05:48.215 --> 05:51.707
that cannot be diminished
by a nice cup of tea."

06:15.842 --> 06:18.402
- PFC James Winston?
- Yes, sir.

06:18.979 --> 06:23.279
- High school quarterback?
- La Habra High, 2006 city champs.

06:23.450 --> 06:27.113
Think you'd hit that any harder
if Corporal Porter's picture was on it?

06:28.722 --> 06:29.746
NCIS?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.357
Look, I liked Tommy.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.894
- His C.O. Said you had issues.
- We did, he owed me.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.491
- How much?
- A couple of grand.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.602
- A lot of money on a PFC's salary.
- Not enough to kill him over.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.597
Look, I was pissed
he was slow in paying me back.

06:47.774 --> 06:51.301
I'm not saying I wasn't,
but he'd borrowed from me before

06:51.478 --> 06:53.639
and he always came through.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.248
He said he had something going on,
wouldn't be much longer.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.747
What kind of something?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.818
Business deal was supposed
to pay off big.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.650
He was real excited about it.

07:05.392 --> 07:06.882
Where were you the day
he was killed?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.519
In my barracks room.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.196
You got somebody
that can vouch for you?

07:11.398 --> 07:14.697
Just my rack and the throne,
too many Jacks the night before.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.396
- Do you mind?
- Be my guest.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.800
Give it your best shot.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.441
Thanks.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.820
I was a receiver,
a damn good wide receiver.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.517
But you wanted to be a quarterback.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.185
Everybody wants to be
a quarterback.

07:43.363 --> 07:46.196
Quarterbacks are the stars,
get all the glory, they get the applause.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.164
- They get the girls.
- Yeah, that too.

07:49.369 --> 07:50.734
Okay, thanks.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.871
Beverly Hills P.D.
Forensics came in.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.837
Corporal Porter died from massive
blood loss after his jugular vein

07:56.009 --> 07:57.738
and carotid artery were severed.

07:57.944 --> 08:01.436
The throat cut
and hand amputation were made by,

08:01.648 --> 08:03.809
and I quote here,
"A very sharp blade

08:03.984 --> 08:06.748
between 7 and 12 inches in length."

08:06.987 --> 08:09.717
Well, that would describe any number
of ka-bar combat knives.

08:09.956 --> 08:12.083
That could describe any number
of all kinds of knives.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.459
Including ones used
at the sushi restaurant at the mall.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.190
A sushi chef would have murdered
Corporal Porter?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.898
Omakase can be tricky, Kensi.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.203
- You know, because if you...
- I got it, okay?

08:24.404 --> 08:25.604
- I don't think...
- Thank you.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.901
- No, I mean just to clarify.
- I get it.

08:28.775 --> 08:31.243
- It means "chef'ss..."
- We're good.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.405
So how well did you
know Porter, Corporal Peterson?

08:34.581 --> 08:36.981
Tom and I
hit it off the first day we met.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.208
We were the only Marines
into football.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.114
Real football.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.582
Soccer.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.782
He was Man U, I'm Arsenal.

08:45.992 --> 08:47.960
Anybody in their right mind
hates the Red Devils.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.722
But I loved him for loving the game.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.867
You don't have a clue, of course.
Not many Americans do.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.904
Except every four years
when the World Cup comes around.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.973
Then they all pretend to give a crap.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.906
Do you have any idea who
would've wanted to kill your buddy?

09:06.313 --> 09:08.213
He was a cool dude.

09:08.815 --> 09:11.079
- Diane must be devastated.
- Diane?

09:11.818 --> 09:15.720
His girlfriend, Diane Farley,
works at Easy Mart.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.948
They were thinking
about getting married, except...

09:18.825 --> 09:20.224
Except what?

09:20.927 --> 09:22.986
She thought
that he was cheating on her.

09:23.163 --> 09:25.563
Not sure why,
he was crazy about that girl.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.500
The parking garage
has four surveillance cams.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.765
Let's start
with the one near the entrance.

09:37.410 --> 09:40.902
All right, I've cued it back an hour
before they found the body.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.743
- Corporal Porter drove a grey...
- A grey Nissan.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.442
There.

09:46.620 --> 09:47.814
Time of entry, 2:25.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.682
Seven minutes
before the guard found his body.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.791
- Let's see if we can find him on one...
- On one of the other cams.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.324
You and I have a problem?

10:01.334 --> 10:05.634
I wouldn't exactly call it a problem,
more like a situation.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.367
Maybe a problem.

10:08.809 --> 10:09.935
Because I'm new.

10:10.677 --> 10:13.669
- No, because you...
- Finish your sentences.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.109
Yeah.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.717
It has to do with being a Type A
with borderline ADD

10:18.885 --> 10:21.080
and control issues
with men I admire.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.984
It's something I'm aware of,
working on

10:24.157 --> 10:26.717
and hope one day
to have a measure of control over.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.453
- You admire me?
- Stop.

10:30.597 --> 10:32.292
Stop the tape.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.029
Whoever cut off
Corporal Porter's hand...

10:44.911 --> 10:47.141
Wanted what was inside that case.

10:47.672 --> 10:49.139
Yeah.

11:01.260 --> 11:04.229
Standard issue Smith and
Wesson 100 series handcuffs.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.957
Twenty-five bucks online.
It doesn't make sense.

11:08.134 --> 11:10.261
Bolt cutters could have snapped
them off no problem.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.961
Nothing unusual
about the briefcase either.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.231
So the $64,000 question is...

11:15.441 --> 11:16.965
What's in the briefcase?

11:17.176 --> 11:18.541
It could be anything.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.611
Well, the most obvious is classified
material from his G-2 unit.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.612
They're halfway through the audit
and nothing's come up compromised.

11:24.784 --> 11:27.184
Drugs, bearer bonds,
securities, jewelry.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.015
Or the most basic of all, cash.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.180
Well, Eric said the bank
and credit card accounts

11:32.358 --> 11:34.451
haven't shown any unusual
deposits or charges.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.652
Sure, but cash like that
never sees the inside of a bank.

11:37.830 --> 11:40.492
If the money was dirty,
they wouldn't want a paper trail.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.566
Maybe he was here to spend it.

11:45.171 --> 11:48.334
Corporal Peterson said
he was thinking about getting married.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.032
An engagement ring from Tiffany's?

11:51.010 --> 11:53.501
You have no idea
what that little blue box means to a girl.

11:54.313 --> 11:55.780
Oh, but I do.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.516
Does Hetty cook?

12:01.687 --> 12:04.087
Well, if she does,
it's with a pot from Singapore,

12:04.290 --> 12:08.192
a spoon given to her by a shaman,
and a cookbook written in Swahili.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.829
I'm more of a frozen
Pizza Pocket guy myself.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.022
Well, the ladies must love that.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.190
It's all about the wine pairing.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.570
Diane?

12:26.946 --> 12:28.607
Hi, can I help you find something?

12:29.448 --> 12:32.076
Is there anywhere we could talk?

12:34.720 --> 12:37.382
Look, if I leave the floor
they're gonna dock my pay.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.217
And since Tom and I
weren't married yet,

12:39.392 --> 12:41.417
the bereavement leave
doesn't apply.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.960
- Have you found out who did this?
- Not yet.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.928
We were hoping
that you could help us out.

12:51.203 --> 12:52.568
That's my supervisor.

12:54.540 --> 12:58.032
Deeks,
I see a Crock-Pot in your future.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.280
- Deeks?
- Right, Crock-Pot.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.845
- Over there.
- Hi, do you sell Crock-Pots?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.425
Was Tom in any kind of trouble?

13:14.360 --> 13:15.486
No.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.095
No, not that I knew about,
he was a really great guy.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.060
I'm sure he was.

13:20.232 --> 13:22.063
But someone killed him and...

13:24.737 --> 13:27.069
They did that for a reason, Diane.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.008
When he came back from Iraq,
he was different.

13:32.244 --> 13:33.336
Different how?

13:33.512 --> 13:39.109
All he could talk about
were sports cars, plasma TVs,

13:39.318 --> 13:40.342
expensive watches.

13:40.519 --> 13:43.818
- You were thinking of getting married.
- Yeah.

13:45.124 --> 13:47.183
Yeah, we were looking at rings.

13:48.260 --> 13:52.196
I even found one.
It was just a simple band

13:52.398 --> 13:56.425
with a tiny diamond,

13:57.937 --> 13:59.837
but I really loved it.

14:02.008 --> 14:04.533
But he said it wasn't big enough.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.470
That could be guilt.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.805
Was he cheating on you?

14:11.317 --> 14:13.547
Tom liked to flirt.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.711
He did, that was just him.

14:20.159 --> 14:22.559
But I was jealous.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.066
So stupid.

14:30.569 --> 14:32.298
So stupid.

14:38.177 --> 14:40.975
The contents of Porter's car.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.171
Gas station receipt
from the Orange County station

14:43.349 --> 14:44.714
the morning of Porter's murder.

14:44.950 --> 14:48.886
Forty bucks of unleaded
and a $1.50 for "Ultra Trank?"

14:49.588 --> 14:51.021
Ultra's a line of herbal drinks

14:51.190 --> 14:53.351
formulated to boost brain function
and enhance moods.

14:53.526 --> 14:55.153
Trank is supposed to calm
you down.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.192
- Trank like...
- Tranquilizer.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.057
You're good.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.896
Sorry, nervous sarcasm.
It's another of my personality flaws.

15:03.069 --> 15:06.402
I have a lot of them but I'm aware
of them, that's the good thing.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.233
You realize
you finished my sentence?

15:09.241 --> 15:12.210
I wouldn't consider it a problem yet.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.274
Here's what is.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.745
Most people would want
the opposite of trank,

15:17.917 --> 15:19.908
if you're leaving for a road trip
in the morning.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.179
Unless you're about to do something
that makes you nervous.

15:23.355 --> 15:26.916
Very good, said sincerely.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.257
Got an ATM receipt
from the same gas station.

15:32.498 --> 15:34.466
He took out 60 bucks.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.761
You don't take out cash
if you have enough to fill a briefcase.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.064
Parking receipts.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.637
One from the Rodeo Collection.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.605
The other from United Parking,
downtown.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.644
- Hm. When?
- Two days ago.

15:48.547 --> 15:51.107
That's two trips to Los Angeles
in 48 hours.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.114
Where's the garage downtown?

15:54.153 --> 15:56.212
Inside the California jewelry Mart.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.058
Two hundred stores
of wholesale heaven, G.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.421
A lot of the merchandise
gets sold to retailers,

16:02.595 --> 16:04.790
a lot of stores sell direct.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.727
Porter was either here
to find a middle man

16:06.899 --> 16:08.730
to help him unload the goodies
in that case.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.836
Or buy some goodies at bargain prices
with the cash in the case.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.561
Jewelry Mart 101.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.003
The thing is his girlfriend said
that he was impulsive

16:16.175 --> 16:17.665
when it came to spending.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.107
That's not the kind of guy
that's gonna drive 100 miles

16:20.279 --> 16:21.940
to the Jewelry Mart to get a bargain.

16:22.114 --> 16:25.049
The question is what was he selling
and who was he selling it to?

16:31.190 --> 16:33.750
- You think she'd use it?
- Hetty likes letters.

16:34.627 --> 16:36.288
It is exotic.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.861
Beautiful, isn't it?

16:38.364 --> 16:40.832
From the Bengal region of East India,
circa 1940.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.261
- How much?
- Fourteen thousand.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.463
Not rupees.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.630
Ha-ha. Not rupees.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.172
You ever seen this guy?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.073
Take a different approach.

16:59.652 --> 17:02.212
If somebody wanted to sell something
they shouldn't be selling,

17:02.388 --> 17:04.685
who would they go to around here?

17:06.692 --> 17:09.092
Jacob Rosen, third floor.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.361
Ten fifteen, early lunch.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.999
Security panel's not lit.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.034
You don't leave a store full of jewels
without turning on the alarm.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.885
Mr. Rosen?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.127
Thank you.

18:20.232 --> 18:22.291
So the guy with the letter opener
was right.

18:22.468 --> 18:24.368
Jacob Rosen is the man you went to

18:24.570 --> 18:26.561
if you had things
of questionable origin to sell.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.501
He'd find you a buyer
for a price.

18:29.241 --> 18:31.436
- The hand, Sam.
- I know.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.511
Whoever cut off Rosen's
didn't take it like they did Porter's.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.807
- Why?
- Didn't need to.

18:36.982 --> 18:40.076
- It wasn't attached to a briefcase.
- Why do you cut it off?

18:40.953 --> 18:42.147
To send a message?

18:43.889 --> 18:45.083
Maybe.

18:45.290 --> 18:48.191
L.A.P.D. Is
actually being reasonable.

18:48.427 --> 18:51.191
Because this homicide is part
of our ongoing criminal investigation,

18:51.396 --> 18:53.330
they're down for us
taking whatever we need.

18:53.532 --> 18:56.365
I don't think it's a matter
of being reasonable, Sam.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.266
- Because of their caseload?
- Because Jacob Rosen was old school.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.442
No computer?

19:08.480 --> 19:09.970
No computer.

19:12.718 --> 19:13.776
In this day and age,

19:13.952 --> 19:16.716
why would you write anything
but your signature by hand?

19:16.955 --> 19:19.822
- Doesn't make sense.
- It's ridiculous.

19:20.025 --> 19:23.461
What have I done
to put together a group

19:23.629 --> 19:28.532
with no appreciation
of the handwritten word?

19:29.234 --> 19:34.365
Even banal ledger entries have
intrinsically more meaning to the writer

19:34.573 --> 19:38.065
and by extension
to the reader as well.

19:40.045 --> 19:43.742
- I'm at a loss.
- Unfortunately, Hetty, so are we.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.308
Maybe not.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.477
Looks like he did business
with at least four jewelry stores

19:50.656 --> 19:52.521
near Rodeo Drive
on a regular basis.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.550
We ran backgrounds
on the employees

19:55.727 --> 19:57.354
and owners
of the four jewelry stores.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.554
None seem to have any relevance.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.528
Except for one.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.701
Aziz Anshiri is a devout Muslim

20:03.869 --> 20:06.702
and owner of the Anshiri jewelry
on Brighton Way.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.738
He was a prominent jeweler
during Saddam Hussein's regime,

20:09.975 --> 20:12.068
serving the president's family
himself on occasion.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.211
Now, during Corporal Porter's tour
in Iraq,

20:14.413 --> 20:17.280
his squad leader was accused
of stealing valuables

20:17.482 --> 20:19.507
from a house
that they raided in Baghdad.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.744
Not just any valuables.

20:21.920 --> 20:24.115
Ancient jewelry looted
from the National Museum

20:24.289 --> 20:25.779
when we invaded in '03.

20:26.024 --> 20:28.083
Porter was questioned,
but not implicated.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.784
The National Museum was home
to some of the greatest treasures

20:30.996 --> 20:32.896
from Ancient Babylon
and Mesopotamia.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.862
U.S. Didn't bomb it,
but we also didn't secure it afterwards.

20:36.034 --> 20:39.128
So when the museum employees
split for their safety,

20:39.304 --> 20:41.204
Iraqis went on a looting spree.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.203
Not our finest hour.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.036
Over half of the artifacts
are still missing today.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.772
Oh, and Jacob Rosen's
phone records

20:50.015 --> 20:52.779
indicate that he called Aziz Anshiri
just a few days ago.

20:57.522 --> 20:59.922
So maybe Porter did
the same thing his squad leader did.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.923
Stole something in Iraq
he had already stolen

21:02.094 --> 21:04.756
- from the museum and took it home.
- Only he didn't get caught.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.931
And then Jacob Rosen
hooked him up with Anshiri,

21:07.099 --> 21:09.124
Porter tried to sell it to him.

21:09.668 --> 21:13.069
And then Anshiri, being a devout
Muslim and a friend of Saddam,

21:13.272 --> 21:15.172
took offence to the theft
and killed him.

21:15.407 --> 21:16.431
Why cut off his hand?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.076
Porter must have had the key
to the handcuffs on him, right?

21:19.244 --> 21:23.738
It takes time to sever a limb, besides
being incredibly, you know, messy.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.179
It's a strict interpretation
of Sharia law.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.182
It calls for the cutting off
of the thief'ss hands as punishment.

21:29.421 --> 21:32.584
In Anshiri's mind,
Jacob Rosen was as bad as Porter.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.658
He killed him
and cut off his hand as well.

21:35.761 --> 21:37.194
He might be trying to make a point.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.626
It's a good theory,
but it's just a theory.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.198
We've got to get close to Anshiri.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.795
Feel out his interest
in old school jewelry.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.439
This is the Rolex M-Series.

21:48.607 --> 21:53.567
Milgauss green,
Faraday cage construction,

21:53.779 --> 21:56.441
40 millimeter polished steel bezel.

21:57.349 --> 22:01.376
Rumored to become the most
collected Rolex ever.

22:01.586 --> 22:04.885
Mm-hm. Does it shoot poisonous gas
or anything cool?

22:08.593 --> 22:10.527
You scratch it, you buy it.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.635
And Ms. Blye, it's your wrist

22:17.803 --> 22:22.331
that hopefully makes the biggest
impression on Mr. Anshiri.

22:22.541 --> 22:24.805
From Ancient Babylonia.

22:25.010 --> 22:30.642
Displayed in Baghdad's National
Museum until the U.S. Invasion.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.212
- How did you...?
- Did you...?

22:43.128 --> 22:44.618
There's the happy couple now.

22:44.830 --> 22:46.422
What do you think?
Lady and the Tramp?

22:46.631 --> 22:48.030
More like Beauty and the Beast.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.628
Uh-oh, trouble in paradise.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.897
- Do you buy them as a couple?
- It's L.A.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.940
Even a troll can score a supermodel
if he's rolling large.

22:58.176 --> 23:00.701
- So where does that leave us?
- Don't sweat it, G.

23:00.912 --> 23:03.346
- I have a charming personality.
- Uh-huh.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.882
And you? You're kind of screwed.

23:07.085 --> 23:09.212
I attract more of an intellectual type.

23:09.421 --> 23:10.945
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.056
Good luck with that.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.354
Good afternoon.
How can I help you?

23:20.899 --> 23:22.764
We are looking
for an engagement ring.

23:22.968 --> 23:25.232
- Of course.
- A big one.

23:25.871 --> 23:28.931
She told me that size doesn't matter.

23:32.043 --> 23:34.443
- There you go.
- Oh, my God.

23:34.679 --> 23:36.169
Look at that one.

23:36.782 --> 23:39.876
Oh, it's so beautiful, my sweet.

23:41.052 --> 23:42.542
Excellent choice.

23:46.925 --> 23:50.292
A beautiful diamond
for a beautiful woman.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.730
That's an interesting bracelet.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.496
Do you mind
if I ask you where you got it?

23:58.737 --> 24:01.001
- Oh, it was a gift.
- From who?

24:01.940 --> 24:03.066
A friend.

24:07.512 --> 24:08.638
I can't help you.

24:10.749 --> 24:11.773
You must leave.

24:16.354 --> 24:19.152
- What were you doing in there?
- Trying to make it look convincing.

24:19.324 --> 24:21.986
You suck at being convincing, Deeks.
Who the hell says "my sweet"?

24:22.227 --> 24:25.754
- It's a term of endearment.
- In like 1945.

24:25.931 --> 24:28.764
Callen, we need to watch this guy.
He's definitely sketchy.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.333
We're talking about Anshiri, right?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.738
Princess? Princess.

24:39.344 --> 24:41.608
- What?
- Don't worry about it.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.316
Thank you.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.961
Just be careful with the car, okay?

24:57.128 --> 24:59.028
Of course, sir.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.300
Anshiri seems nervous.

25:02.467 --> 25:05.197
The only way to find out why he's
nervous is to be inside with him.

25:05.904 --> 25:06.962
Here's the bonus, Sam.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.629
I'm hungry and it's gonna be
on Hetty's dime.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.365
You got to get more current, G.

25:11.543 --> 25:15.479
This place is flavor of the month.
Four weeks to get a res.

25:15.647 --> 25:17.478
It's L.A.

25:17.649 --> 25:19.549
Then we do what everybody else
in L.A. Does.

25:19.784 --> 25:20.842
Buy our way in?

25:21.052 --> 25:22.815
Lie.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.928
You got to take a photo
and send it to Eric.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.928
Those losers in marketing
won't believe

25:40.105 --> 25:42.437
we got reservations at this place.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.672
- Got it.
- No photo.

25:44.843 --> 25:48.609
- Relax, hey, relax.
- Hey, my man.

25:54.553 --> 25:57.021
Federal agents, stand down,
stand down.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.767
- Yeah.
- Got the pic.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.607
Facial rec took all
of two seconds to get a hit.

26:23.348 --> 26:25.111
His name is Salim Al-Jamal.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.875
He's a major player
in terrorist funding for Al-Qaeda.

26:43.334 --> 26:44.961
Salim Al-Jamal.

26:45.169 --> 26:47.694
A businessman that funnels money
to the Middle East

26:47.872 --> 26:49.999
to finance Islamic terrorist
training camps.

26:50.174 --> 26:51.471
I did not know this.

26:51.642 --> 26:54.202
I only know him as a potential client,
that's all.

26:55.413 --> 26:57.313
It's the truth.

26:58.649 --> 27:00.344
How about this guy?

27:02.887 --> 27:04.821
You recognize him?

27:08.860 --> 27:10.987
His name
was Corporal Thomas Porter.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.195
I've never seen this man before.

27:14.399 --> 27:17.232
You were meeting with him
to buy ancient artifacts.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.666
A meeting that was arranged
by Jacob Rosen.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.805
No, that's not true.

27:22.006 --> 27:25.601
You consider yourself
to be a true believer, Mr. Anshiri?

27:28.513 --> 27:30.344
Sam, what does the Qur'an
say about lying?

27:30.548 --> 27:32.607
It's considered an abomination.

27:35.853 --> 27:38.378
You are trying to use my religion
against me.

27:41.926 --> 27:43.086
It won't work.

27:47.565 --> 27:50.534
Anshiri's a mean decorator,
he's got some cool stuff.

27:50.701 --> 27:54.137
Yeah, if you like living in a museum.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.408
We're looking for a knife, right?

28:03.381 --> 28:07.545
It's decorative.
You'd have a tough time slicing bread.

28:18.429 --> 28:20.761
What are you doing in my house?

28:22.733 --> 28:24.598
- Mrs. Anshiri?
- Who are you?

28:25.303 --> 28:26.770
We're federal agents.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.404
You have no right to be here.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.870
Actually, we do, ma'am.
It's called a FISA warrant.

28:32.310 --> 28:36.076
We have to search your house.
I promise we'll be respectful.

28:36.280 --> 28:38.373
Where is my husband?

28:39.383 --> 28:41.681
- You met Porter.
- No.

28:41.919 --> 28:44.080
He tried to sell you artifacts
stolen from Iraq.

28:44.288 --> 28:45.915
I did not meet this man.

28:46.124 --> 28:47.955
You did meet this man
and you killed this man.

28:48.126 --> 28:51.254
And following strict Sharia law, you
cut off the thief'ss hand as punishment.

28:51.429 --> 28:52.453
I did not do that.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.098
Then you took the artifacts and you
sold them to raise money

28:55.266 --> 28:57.496
for Al-Jamal terrorist activities.

28:59.470 --> 29:03.600
You invade my country
under false pretences.

29:03.774 --> 29:08.541
You allow our National Museum
and our palaces to be plundered.

29:08.713 --> 29:11.443
You bomb our villages
to kill our women and children.

29:11.616 --> 29:13.516
And you call me a terrorist?

30:07.405 --> 30:08.963
Deeks.

30:15.079 --> 30:16.239
Hey...

30:18.115 --> 30:20.845
This one was used
for more than slicing bread.

30:36.801 --> 30:40.293
Well, I pushed him, and he broke.

30:40.504 --> 30:45.032
Yeah, only he broke left
when we expected him to break right.

30:46.877 --> 30:49.903
That kind of moral outrage
is hard to fake.

30:55.753 --> 30:56.777
Kensi.

30:56.954 --> 30:58.080
I think we found the knife.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.724
Deeks is sending Callen a picture
right now.

31:00.891 --> 31:02.290
Incoming to your cell.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.623
We can definitely confirm
Anshiri's devoutness, in his house.

31:05.830 --> 31:09.561
A Qur'an, scriptures, prayer rugs,
and his wife wears a hijab.

31:10.268 --> 31:11.530
Got it.

31:11.736 --> 31:12.930
We have the photo.

31:15.139 --> 31:16.902
Is the knife resting on a paper bag?

31:17.108 --> 31:19.474
Yeah, it was inside it
hidden in a tool box.

31:20.077 --> 31:21.840
We'll get back to you.

31:22.780 --> 31:24.509
What is it?

31:24.682 --> 31:28.140
The Sharia amputation ritual
for theft is very specific.

31:28.352 --> 31:31.014
The knife doesn't matter,
but what does is what it's wrapped in.

31:31.188 --> 31:35.352
It would be a sacred ceremonial cloth,
not a paper bag.

31:35.593 --> 31:38.289
So whoever hid the knife
got the ritual wrong.

31:38.496 --> 31:41.363
Anshiri is devout,
he wouldn't have got it wrong.

31:41.599 --> 31:45.592
As much as I don't like him, G.,
he's being set up.

31:57.014 --> 32:00.780
So the necklace you found
was a small part of what Queen Puabi

32:00.984 --> 32:04.249
was adorned with when she was
buried in the Royal Tomb of Ur

32:04.488 --> 32:08.015
2500 years ago in Mesopotamia,
now modern day Iraq.

32:08.225 --> 32:10.284
The tomb was discovered in 1922.

32:10.527 --> 32:15.055
What made the find remarkable was
that it had avoided looters for centuries.

32:15.232 --> 32:18.531
After the jewelry was put
on display in Iraq's National Museum,

32:18.702 --> 32:22.229
it took a mere 60 years for it
to be looted by locals after we invaded.

32:22.439 --> 32:26.102
So the necklace was left with the knife
to set up Anshiri. Which means...

32:26.276 --> 32:28.210
A lot more
of Queen Puabi's jewelry

32:28.378 --> 32:31.074
is still in the case
Corporal Porter was carrying.

32:37.554 --> 32:38.612
She does that.

32:38.822 --> 32:41.882
Its return would mean a lot
for Iraq-U.S. Relations.

32:42.092 --> 32:43.787
That's if we can find it
before it's sold.

32:44.795 --> 32:47.093
So whoever killed Porter
and set up Anshiri

32:47.264 --> 32:49.129
either knew Porter
or he knew Rosen.

32:49.333 --> 32:50.425
Or both.

32:51.835 --> 32:54.736
Kensi, Deeks,
get back to Rosen's boxes.

32:54.938 --> 32:56.496
- See if you can find a vector.
- Done.

32:56.673 --> 32:58.538
Eric, this guy probably drove
to Anshiri's.

32:58.742 --> 33:00.232
Check for nearby traffic cams.

33:02.312 --> 33:05.645
The closest traffic cam
is on the corner of Bedford and Elvado.

33:05.816 --> 33:09.047
- Just two blocks down.
- Eric, there.

33:10.921 --> 33:12.752
That's it all right.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.656
Windows are too dark
to make the driver.

33:15.859 --> 33:18.953
No, Sam,
it's the car that we recognize.

33:19.563 --> 33:21.997
That same SUV
entered the parking garage

33:22.199 --> 33:25.191
just an hour
before Porter was killed.

33:25.969 --> 33:28.164
If I can adjust the angle,
we might be able to...

33:28.338 --> 33:30.772
- To see the license plate.
- To see the license plate.

33:32.576 --> 33:34.100
On it.

33:34.945 --> 33:36.936
The car belongs to...

33:40.284 --> 33:42.184
PFC Winston.

33:42.619 --> 33:44.450
The one Porter owed money to.

33:45.355 --> 33:47.380
Quarterbacks.

34:05.475 --> 34:07.636
Would you mind being quiet?

34:07.845 --> 34:09.972
I am trying to concentrate.

34:12.716 --> 34:14.183
- Are you mad at me?
- Dogs go mad.

34:14.351 --> 34:15.841
People, people get angry.

34:20.424 --> 34:22.654
Is this about the jewelry store?

34:23.860 --> 34:26.193
I was just trying to sell
the fact that we were a couple.

34:26.396 --> 34:29.092
Yeah, whatever, like anybody
would believe that we're a couple.

34:29.266 --> 34:30.699
Right, you are so not my type.

34:35.272 --> 34:37.239
- Would you care to explain...
- Found something.

34:42.913 --> 34:45.245
You got this wrong,
I can prove I was on base all day.

34:45.415 --> 34:46.541
Your car wasn't.

34:46.717 --> 34:48.514
I have no idea
how that could have happened.

34:48.685 --> 34:51.176
Maybe because you gave it
to whoever you hired to do the job.

34:51.355 --> 34:52.995
No, that's not true,
I didn't hire anyone.

34:54.091 --> 34:55.558
- Kensi.
- We found a vector.

34:55.759 --> 34:57.693
A name on one of Jacob Rosen's
payment ledgers.

34:57.861 --> 34:59.260
He worked for Rosen as a courier.

34:59.463 --> 35:01.897
- Who had access to your keys?
- No one.

35:02.099 --> 35:04.659
Somebody could have made a copy.
A car wash, a mechanic?

35:04.868 --> 35:07.359
I wash it myself, the repairs...

35:09.573 --> 35:11.803
It was a personal vehicle,
he's not supposed to.

35:11.975 --> 35:14.910
- Who's he, Winston?
- A guy I know in the motor pool.

35:15.112 --> 35:16.807
That would be Corporal Peterson.

35:19.216 --> 35:21.707
He didn't show up for work
this morning, left us a man short.

35:21.885 --> 35:22.909
Any idea where he may be?

35:23.086 --> 35:24.747
Not in his barracks room,
we checked.

35:24.922 --> 35:28.085
Maybe with his girlfriend in San Isidro.
He spends a lot of time there.

35:28.258 --> 35:30.226
- The girlfriend's name?
- Ellen.

35:30.427 --> 35:33.260
- Ellen what?
- No idea, sir.

35:37.067 --> 35:39.592
Eric, give me a name for
Corporal Andrew Peterson's girlfriend

35:39.770 --> 35:41.431
in San Isidro, I need it fast.

35:41.638 --> 35:42.696
- Name?
- Ellen.

35:42.906 --> 35:44.203
No last.

35:44.708 --> 35:46.300
Do they always expect miracles?

35:46.510 --> 35:48.102
- Pretty much.
- Awesomer.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.109
Into Peterson's cell records.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.408
I got a number he calls
in San Isidro a lot.

35:54.251 --> 35:56.742
- Reverse directory for an Ellen...
- Rodriguez.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.252
- 6241...
- Garvey Court Road.

36:01.725 --> 36:03.989
- Nice work.
- You too.

36:40.130 --> 36:41.620
Stop, federal agents.

36:56.179 --> 36:58.647
He's making a run
for the border, Sam.

37:28.845 --> 37:30.369
The border fence ends in five miles.

37:30.547 --> 37:32.242
He crosses over, he's in Mexico.

37:32.449 --> 37:33.711
It's not gonna happen.

37:48.465 --> 37:51.332
Hands out the window
where we can see them, now.

37:55.272 --> 37:57.604
That's an order, Marine.

38:30.740 --> 38:33.300
Director Vance.

38:33.510 --> 38:35.944
Peterson was the missing link.

38:36.113 --> 38:39.082
Porter tells his best friend
about what he'd stolen in Iraq.

38:39.249 --> 38:42.275
Peterson hooks him up with his old
boss, who hooks him up with Anshiri.

38:42.786 --> 38:45.482
Best friend kills Porter and Rosen,
sets up Anshiri,

38:45.655 --> 38:48.419
and uses Winston's car
while he's in L.A. So he can't be ID'd.

38:48.625 --> 38:50.024
Yeah, it would've been a good plan

38:50.193 --> 38:53.287
if it wasn't for a certain wide receiver
that knew about Sharia.

38:53.463 --> 38:55.522
Someone has to put points
on the board.

38:59.302 --> 39:00.792
Here comes the birthday girl.

39:02.172 --> 39:07.132
Beverly Hills P.D. Discovered this
among Corporal Porter's belongings.

39:08.111 --> 39:10.443
I assured them
we'd know what to do with it.

39:11.848 --> 39:15.443
Director Vance wants you all to know
how pleased he is

39:15.619 --> 39:18.144
that you were able to recover
the artifacts.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.718
Well done.

39:24.661 --> 39:26.128
She seems down.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.063
Birthdays can be depressing.

39:28.298 --> 39:30.789
Especially when no one buys you a gift
or throws you a party.

39:30.967 --> 39:35.199
Hey, it's what she wanted,
and for once, we didn't cave.

39:48.485 --> 39:52.717
Happy birthday, Hetty,
from all of us.

39:58.828 --> 40:02.594
I thought it would go perfect
with your...

40:02.832 --> 40:04.459
Saffron jacket.

40:04.968 --> 40:06.401
Exactly.

40:07.370 --> 40:10.339
But this is from you alone.

40:11.174 --> 40:13.233
No.

40:23.987 --> 40:27.081
It's beautiful, my dear.

40:28.692 --> 40:31.525
So, what's wrong with all of you?

40:32.195 --> 40:35.631
This is a party, not a wake.

40:35.799 --> 40:39.098
The single malt's in my desk.

40:42.105 --> 40:44.232
Well, that went well.

40:44.641 --> 40:47.940
Hey, you got a banjo
and a chewing tobacco please?

40:50.380 --> 40:52.245
Happy birthday.

40:57.387 --> 40:59.446
- Hetty, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday.

40:59.656 --> 41:01.749
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

41:13.169 --> 41:14.636
Hello?

41:14.804 --> 41:19.070
Diane, hey.
Special Agent Kensi Blye, NCIS.

41:20.543 --> 41:24.741
I was wondering
if I could drop by. I, um...

41:25.649 --> 41:27.913
I have something
that Tom left for you.

41:28.084 --> 41:32.919
Really? He left something for me?
Sure.
