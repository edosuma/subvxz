- I'm working on it.
Get ready.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.756
- Well, I'd say
there's nothing to be afraid of,

02:37.791 --> 02:39.525
but that's not exactly true.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.792
- Of course not.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.362
- This finale will be
all about thrills, chills,

02:43.397 --> 02:46.031
and of course, big scares.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.399
- Nice.

02:47.434 --> 02:50.369
- And that is where my friend

genre with mega-hit franchises

02:59.713 --> 03:03.348

"Insidious," and "The Purge."

that this finale
is going to dive deep

03:23.604 --> 03:26.071
into the world of horror.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.372
- Okay.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.875
- For your final
Spotlight Challenge,

03:29.910 --> 03:32.110
you'll each be creatgin
two makeups

03:32.146 --> 03:35.514
that will star
in their very own horror film.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.050
- Wow.
- Yeah! [laughs]

03:38.085 --> 03:41.420
- I'm sure you're wondering what
your films are gonna be about.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.422
Well, Jason here
has curated and published

03:43.457 --> 03:46.191
his very own book
of horrific short stories

03:46.227 --> 03:49.127
called "The Blumhouse
Book of Nightmares."

03:49.163 --> 03:51.530
And the show's producers
have adapted one

03:51.565 --> 03:54.366
written by Christopher Denham
called "Hellhole."

03:54.401 --> 03:57.069
Jason, why don't you tell them
a little bit more about this?

03:57.104 --> 03:59.204
- Well, "Hellhole"
is about a family.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.708
They buy a house and after
a few nights in the house,

04:02.743 --> 04:06.211
they realize they have
a portal to hell and a demon

04:06.247 --> 04:08.614
and very bad things
start to happen.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.449
- All right.
- Sounds like fun.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.485
- All right, guys, so we found
three up-and-coming directors

04:13.520 --> 04:16.888
who have each come up with
their own take on the script.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.457
You will each
be working with them

04:18.492 --> 04:19.925
over t cheourse of the next week

04:19.960 --> 04:23.895
to create your films
here at this very creepy house.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.264
- Wow.

04:25.299 --> 04:26.765
<i>- This challenge</i>
<i>is very exciting.</i>

04:26.800 --> 04:28.934
<i>We'll be working</i>
<i>as on-set makeup artists.</i>

04:28.969 --> 04:31.603
This is as real as it gets,
so that's really cool.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.771
- All right, well,
let's meet

04:32.806 --> 04:35.440

04:46.787 --> 04:47.786
- Thanks for having us.
- Good to be here.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.054
- First we have John Wynn.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.557
His spine-chilling supernatural
short film "The Passing"

04:52.593 --> 04:54.393
<i>made its way</i>
<i>to the top of the list</i>

05:05.439 --> 05:07.873
<i>out of veteran horror</i>
<i>filmmaker Eli Roth.</i>

05:07.908 --> 05:08.940
- Nice.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.509
- And last,
we have Ryan Spindell,

05:10.544 --> 05:12.944
an award-winning director who's
been creeping audiences out

05:12.980 --> 05:14.579
<i>at festivals</i>
<i>all over the world,</i>

with you,

05:22.956 --> 05:25.891
but first,
you're gonna need some help

05:25.926 --> 05:28.660
to create
those incredible makeups.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.129
Guys, come on out.

- All right, because
we want great final makeups,

06:07.901 --> 06:10.068
you will each have
a lighting and camera test

06:10.104 --> 06:11.470
before we shoot the film.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.805
This gonna allow your directors
to provide feedback

06:13.841 --> 06:16.108
on your makeups
and give you the ability

06:16.143 --> 06:20.078
to adjust or recreate them
before the film shoot.

06:20.114 --> 06:23.382
All right, well, I do have
another surprise for you.

06:23.417 --> 06:27.085
Jason here will be joining us
as a guest judge for the finale

06:27.121 --> 06:29.955
and helping to choose
this season's winner.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.357

- So make it great.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.759
[applause]

06:33.794 --> 06:35.026
- Very cool.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.096
- Okay, your directors have been
randomly assigned to you

06:38.132 --> 06:39.297
and they'll be along shortly

06:39.333 --> 06:40.732
to talk you through the films.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.034
In the meantime,
go ahead and read your scripts

06:43.070 --> 06:44.703
and start thinking
about your designs.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.071
- Nice.
- Bye, guys.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.839
Good luck.
thbo: Thank you.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.842
<i>[upbeat techno music]</i>

06:50.878 --> 06:55.647
<i>¶ ¶</i>

06:55.682 --> 06:57.282
- Okay, "Hellhole."
Here's the script.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.918
"We open on a wide shot
of a crumbling old farm.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.887
"The landscape
is dead and barren.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.955
<i>"Martha opens</i>
<i>the large double doors.</i>

07:03.991 --> 07:06.158
<i>"Her eyes wide open,</i>
<i>she screams.</i>

07:06.193 --> 07:08.794
<i>"She is completely entwined</i>
<i>in thick black vines.</i>

07:08.829 --> 07:10.996
<i>"The Harvest Demon rises up,</i>

07:11.031 --> 07:15.133
its body a sinewy mass of vines
and skittering insects."

07:15.169 --> 07:16.902
<i>Our director's version</i>
<i>of "Hellhole"</i>

07:16.937 --> 07:19.004
is this family
moves into this house

07:19.039 --> 07:21.740
<i>and a demon comes up</i>
<i>out of the ground.</i>

07:21.775 --> 07:23.542
<i>So the words</i>
<i>that describe our demon</i>

07:23.577 --> 07:25.744
<i>are "gourd" and "sinewy,"</i>

07:25.779 --> 07:28.180
<i>so we're seeing</i>
<i>that the characters</i>

07:28.215 --> 07:29.614
<i>and the demon especially</i>

07:29.650 --> 07:32.684
<i>are very earthy and lots</i>
<i>of vines and tree stuff.</i>

07:32.719 --> 07:34.219
Man, he's so big.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.188
<i>I'm not a huge fan</i>
<i>of doing the tree stuff</i>

07:36.223 --> 07:38.623
and I'm trying to figure out
what I'm gonna do with it.

07:38.659 --> 07:39.925
- Hey, guys.
- How's it going?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.526
- What do you think?
- We're ready to win.

07:41.562 --> 07:42.694
- Pretty cool.
- We're gonna win?

07:42.729 --> 07:43.728
All right.
That's what I want to hear.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.197
That's what I want to hear.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.600
Yeah, so the idea is that
there's this ancient creature

07:48.635 --> 07:50.669
that's been laying
in the ground for centuries

07:50.704 --> 07:53.538
<i>and its roots have spread</i>
<i>throughout the ground.</i>

07:53.574 --> 07:55.373
So its body is,
like, of the land,

07:55.409 --> 07:57.576
but it's also sort of
pulling itself out.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.544
- Ryan is extremely passionate

07:59.580 --> 08:01.746
<i>about the characters</i>
<i>that he's created.</i>

08:01.782 --> 08:04.015
It's definitely helping me see
what he's seeing.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.152
- I want to go with this more,
this organic type of demon,

08:07.187 --> 08:08.987
to break up
the typical human form.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.589
- Yeah, like,
get rid of the nose,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.524
get rid of the ears,
get rid of things like that?

08:12.559 --> 08:13.825
- Yeah.
- Right.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.494
- I think that could be
really, really cool.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.395
<i>- The demon is this</i>
<i>half-pumpkin,</i>

08:17.431 --> 08:19.297
<i>half-tree character.</i>

08:19.333 --> 08:21.199
<i>Everything goes to one angle,</i>

08:21.235 --> 08:24.669
so it's all off balance
and it looks scary all together.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.138
- Walter was talking
about her sort of having,

08:27.174 --> 08:29.875
like, the vines
going in and out of her,

08:29.910 --> 08:31.710
<i>like, almost painfully.</i>

08:31.745 --> 08:33.178
- Yes, I'm into that idea.

08:33.213 --> 08:35.046
- I'm really happy
with what we came up with

08:35.082 --> 08:36.748
<i>for the possessed character,</i>

08:36.783 --> 08:38.316
<i>which is just vines</i>
<i>interweaving</i>

08:38.352 --> 08:40.051
and possessing her
at the same time.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.453
- Thank you so much.
- Good luck.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.554
- Thank you.

08:42.589 --> 08:43.889
<i>I've got a lot to do.</i>

08:43.924 --> 08:45.323
<i>My team and I definitely</i>
<i>have our hands full</i>

08:45.359 --> 08:47.459
with both makeups.

08:50.464 --> 08:53.932
- "Interior old mansion.
Day, 1933."

08:53.967 --> 08:55.600
The script that we have
for "Hellhole"

08:55.636 --> 08:58.770
<i>is about a young couple</i>
<i>who moves onto land</i>

08:58.805 --> 09:01.773
<i>where they want to build</i>
<i>an oil field and in doing so,</i>

09:01.808 --> 09:04.743
<i>they break the Earth</i>
<i>and release this demon</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:06.044
<i>that doesn't want them there.</i>

09:06.079 --> 09:07.512
"She swings
the flashlight forward,

09:07.548 --> 09:11.349
"illuminating a massive horned
figure standing behind her

09:11.385 --> 09:13.585
<i>that looks like it was birthed</i>
<i>from the Earth."</i>

09:13.620 --> 09:14.686
Oh, my God.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.388
- Okay, that demon
sounds amazing.

09:16.423 --> 09:17.656
- Sounds like a lot of work.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.690
- Hi.
- What's up, guys?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.358
I'm so excited.
Rob.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.693
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. Bring it.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.762
- I'm really excited to hear
what our director

09:23.797 --> 09:25.196
has in store for us.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.598
- Just imagine
this thing as, like,

09:26.633 --> 09:29.200
it's been molting and cracking
in that dry earth,

09:29.236 --> 09:31.603
like, even, like, the skin
being kind of, like,

09:31.638 --> 09:33.405
white, pale, crushed, cracked.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.574
- How much do you want us
to stay away from

09:35.609 --> 09:38.243
him looking like a goat?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.745
- I-I feel like
I'd rather see something new.

09:40.781 --> 09:41.846
- Okay.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.348
<i>After talking to Bryce,</i>
<i>we decided</i>

09:43.383 --> 09:46.518
<i>to make the demon look dry</i>
<i>and cracked and sunbaked.</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:47.686
I like when you said

09:47.721 --> 09:49.788
the idea of the creature
being cracked and old.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.590
I was thinking something
like that for her.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.892
If she, like, has, like,
a black tear or something?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.627
For the wife, we're thinking of

09:55.662 --> 09:57.362
<i>just the basic</i>
<i>possession makeup.</i>

09:57.397 --> 09:59.197
<i>There's lots of oil dripping,</i>

09:59.232 --> 10:01.566
<i>so we're thinking of adding</i>
<i>that into the design as well.</i>

10:01.602 --> 10:02.734
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, it's so exciting.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.802
- Okay.
- It's so cool.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.303
- On top.
- Yeah!

10:05.339 --> 10:07.772
[laughter]

10:07.808 --> 10:09.274
- "Interior living room.
Night.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.809
"Martha blows dust
off the old chest,

10:10.844 --> 10:12.811
<i>"lifts the lid open, finally</i>
<i>revealing Mr. Sticks..."</i>

10:12.846 --> 10:13.912
<i>- Ooh!</i>

10:13.947 --> 10:15.947
- "A doll
with a strange cyclops eye."

10:15.983 --> 10:17.515
- I think the script
sounds pretty cool.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.251
<i>It's about this couple</i>
<i>who finds this creepy lldo</i>

10:20.287 --> 10:22.287
<i>named Mr. Sticks</i>
<i>and then they burn him,</i>

10:22.322 --> 10:24.456
and in doing so,
they unleash this demon.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.024
- "Our demon steps forward
into the light,

10:26.059 --> 10:28.727
"revealing the ghastly body
of the chupacabra

10:28.762 --> 10:32.130
<i>"mashed with face</i>
<i>of the hatchetfish</i>

10:32.165 --> 10:35.667
and the teeth
of Goliath tigerfish."

10:35.702 --> 10:36.968
Okay.
- All right.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.770
I'm like, "This looks like
a hot mess," in my head.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.605
<i>So I really need</i>
<i>to talk to the director</i>

10:40.641 --> 10:42.741
because I need to find out
what he means byll a this.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.276
- I really like
the idea of a single eye

10:45.312 --> 10:47.545
somehow in the design
of the creature.

10:47.581 --> 10:51.316
- John really wants the demo
n  as being a cyclops.

10:51.351 --> 10:54.719
And I'm like, "Great,
we just did the cyclops makeup."

10:54.755 --> 10:56.921
- And to help you tie it
together too, at the end of it,

10:56.957 --> 10:58.757
our male is possessed.
- Yeah.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.026
- Think about him becoming
the new Mr. Sticks.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.427
- Yeah.
- That's why hs e'possessed,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.129
because the demon needs a new--
- That's a cool--okay.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.231
- He needs a new connection
to the real world.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.732
I have a very strong idea

11:07.768 --> 11:10.335
and I've told you go godeneral
basis for what that is,

11:10.370 --> 11:13.438
but at the end of the day,
I'm relying on you guys

11:13.473 --> 11:14.873
to make something
unique and special.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.708
- I feel a little overwhelmed,

11:16.743 --> 11:18.677
because I have too many ideas
in my brain.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.011
<i>There's a lot going on</i>

11:20.047 --> 11:21.312
<i>and there's a lot  tofhings</i>
<i>to manage,</i>

11:21.348 --> 11:24.049
and I need to be super duper
organized on this one.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.484
- All right, guys.
Let's get started.

11:26.520 --> 11:32.123
<i>¶ ¶</i>

11:32.159 --> 11:33.491
- Whoo.
- Back to the lab.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.326
Back to the lab.
Back to the lab.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.629
- All right.

11:37.664 --> 11:38.963
- [exhales]
t'Les see what we got.

11:38.999 --> 11:40.165
Here.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.666
<i>The first thing we do</i>
<i>is figure out</i>

11:41.702 --> 11:43.902
<i>what we need to get done</i>
<i>and who can take point on it,</i>

11:43.937 --> 11:45.937
<i>'cause obviously</i>
<i>I can't do everything</i>

11:45.972 --> 11:48.640
and it's really hard to, like,
relinquish that control.

11:48.675 --> 11:49.874
I want to take the face
on this one

11:49.910 --> 11:51.309
'cause I really want
to sculpt this.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.510
- Okay.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.845
- I'm doing the face
for the demon

11:53.880 --> 11:55.113
<i>'cause he's</i>
<i>the central character</i>

11:55.148 --> 11:56.848
<i>and I want to have</i>
<i>the most hands in that.</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:58.450
- I feel more comfortable
with the horns.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.952
- Yvonne really wants the demon
cowl, so she takes that,

12:00.987 --> 12:02.554
<i>and Johnny takes Sam's face.</i>

12:02.589 --> 12:04.422
My idea is that
it's a trauma makeup.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.824
<i>He's had his eye ripped out.</i>

12:05.859 --> 12:07.892
<i>And maybe he's got</i>
<i>some sticks in his face.</i>

12:07.928 --> 12:09.627
- Okay.
- Go.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.062
- All right.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.231
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:13.266 --> 12:15.734
- I'm still not sure how to
incorporate the cyclops aspect

12:15.769 --> 12:20.138
without recreating the makeup
I did on the Cyclops Challenge.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.540
<i>I've scraped the bottom</i>
<i>of my creative barrel,</i>

12:22.576 --> 12:24.075
<i>but this is the finale.</i>

12:24.111 --> 12:26.478
<i>I got to bring it,</i>
<i>I got to bring my A game.</i>

12:26.513 --> 12:28.480
If I can win "Face Off,"
I can have the money

12:28.515 --> 12:30.849
<i>to help move my family</i>
<i>and pursue the career</i>

12:30.884 --> 12:32.550
<i>that I've always wanted to do.</i>

12:32.586 --> 12:35.153
So I need to figure it out.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.922
<i>¶ ¶</i>

12:37.958 --> 12:40.525
- We want this demon
to be larger than life,

12:40.560 --> 12:43.561
<i>so we're doing a chest piece</i>
<i>to bulk him out,</i>

12:43.597 --> 12:45.430
<i>a face piece, and a cowl,</i>

12:45.465 --> 12:47.031
<i>and then for</i>
<i>the possession makeup,</i>

12:47.067 --> 12:52.103
<i>a simple face piece with a very</i>
<i>pale, speckled, cracked look.</i>

12:52.139 --> 12:54.606
<i>Anna starts sculpting</i>
<i>the possession makeup,</i>

12:54.641 --> 12:56.608
<i>and I start sculpting</i>
<i>the demon face.</i>

12:56.643 --> 12:59.577
<i>I'm not too thrilled</i>
<i>with my idea for this demon,</i>

12:59.613 --> 13:01.446
<i>but I don't have</i>
<i>a lot of time left,</i>

13:01.481 --> 13:03.548
so I need to start sculpting
right now.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.483
- Where are you gonna make
the horns coming out of?

13:05.519 --> 13:07.218
- I'm thinking of trying
to build it up.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.653
- Yeah.
- So it makes him look taller.

13:08.688 --> 13:09.854
- Mm-hmm.

13:09.890 --> 13:14.959
<i>¶ ¶</i>

13:14.995 --> 13:17.962
- Robert and I are attacking
the demon makeup

13:17.998 --> 13:20.131
<i>and Mel is sculpti</i>
<i>the possessed makeup.</i>

13:20.167 --> 13:22.000
- How were your directors?
Were they nice?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.401
- Yeah, he's really cool.

13:23.436 --> 13:24.836
- How's your guys's director?

13:24.871 --> 13:26.271
- He's awesome.
- Yeah?

13:26.306 --> 13:28.473
- Definitely has
a lot of faith in Walter.

13:28.508 --> 13:29.474
- Aw.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.876
- I've got so much in store.

13:31.912 --> 13:33.178
- Ruh-roh.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.747
<i>- Ryan wants to avoid</i>
<i>the typical demon look,</i>

13:35.782 --> 13:37.749
so we've got to completely
take away

13:37.784 --> 13:39.450
every single element
that is human

13:39.486 --> 13:41.486
<i>and make a scary</i>
<i>but non-demonic</i>

13:41.521 --> 13:43.154
<i>pumpkin/tree creature.</i>

13:43.190 --> 13:46.558
Since we've got so much
to do with the demon character,

13:46.593 --> 13:48.393
<i>I really want to keep</i>
<i>the possessed makeup</i>

13:48.428 --> 13:50.795
<i>super simple</i>
<i>and very humanlike.</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:53.531
<i>I got to manage my time well</i>
<i>to incorporate everything,</i>

13:53.567 --> 13:56.234
make Ryan happy, but also
do something I'm proud of

13:56.269 --> 13:59.571
that's my style that is gonna
help me win this $100,000.

13:59.606 --> 14:04.843
<i>¶ ¶</i>

14:04.878 --> 14:06.344
- John wants a cyclops demon,

14:06.379 --> 14:08.646
<i>and I think it's important</i>
<i>toho sw him something</i>

14:08.682 --> 14:11.049
<i>that's not already</i>
<i>represented in film,</i>

14:11.084 --> 14:14.185
so I dig deep and decide
to do a cyclops demon

14:14.221 --> 14:17.422
without an eye, so it's just
this fleshy membranes behind,

14:17.457 --> 14:19.791
<i>'cause it gives</i>
<i>that extra element of horror.</i>

14:19.826 --> 14:23.628
<i>Hopefully, John will love it.</i>

14:23.663 --> 14:28.199
<i>¶ ¶</i>

14:28.235 --> 14:30.101
- Hey, guys.
We're here to check in on you.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.302
- Hello.
- Hey.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.104
- And we have a surprise
for you.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.840
- What? What is this?
What is happening?

14:35.876 --> 14:37.275
- Oh, my God.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.344
I'm already really stressed out.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.446
<i>What else are they gonna</i>
<i>throw at us now?</i>

14:49.080 --> 14:50.947
- Hey, guys.
We're here to check in on you.

14:50.982 --> 14:52.148
- Hello.
- Hey.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.950
- And do we have a surprise
for you.

14:53.985 --> 14:57.653
- I would like to introduce
an Oscar-winning makeup artist

14:57.689 --> 14:59.756
<i>who has worked on</i>
<i>"The Princes Bride,"</i>

14:59.791 --> 15:01.758
<i>"Braveheart,"</i>
<i>d an"Lincoln."</i>

15:01.793 --> 15:05.661
And she's also a member
of the "Face Off" family.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.963
Lois Burwell.

15:06.998 --> 15:08.898
- Oh, my goodness.

15:08.933 --> 15:11.834
[laughter and applause]

15:11.870 --> 15:13.002
- How are you?

15:13.038 --> 15:15.505
- What?
I'm so excited to see her.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.441
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to hear her critiques,</i>

15:18.476 --> 15:20.576
and she's just so cute
and British.

15:20.612 --> 15:22.045
- Lovely to meet all oyof u.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.946
I'm looking forward
to seeing your work.

15:23.982 --> 15:26.482
- Guys ready to do this?
- Oh, I'm ready.

15:26.518 --> 15:29.085
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.055
- So he liked the idea
of a lot of angular forms.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.757
<i>Something more animalistic,</i>
<i>kind of dripping with oil.</i>

15:34.793 --> 15:37.860
- I liked doing away with
kind of the nasal labial folds

15:37.896 --> 15:40.396
and bringing the chin down
a little bit more.

15:40.432 --> 15:41.864
- The thing you have to watch

15:41.900 --> 15:45.501
with any cheeks like this
and the nose being rounded,

15:45.537 --> 15:46.803
I know you want animalian,

15:46.838 --> 15:49.105
but everything can end up
looking leonine,

15:49.140 --> 15:54.277
and it's a distraction from what
you actually do want it to be.

15:54.312 --> 15:56.612
- Okay, les t'see
what you have going.

15:56.648 --> 15:58.514
- The idea is that
this will be a vine,

15:58.550 --> 16:01.484
<i>so she can still articulate</i>
<i>and move under it.</i>

16:01.519 --> 16:03.419
- I like what you've done here.

16:03.455 --> 16:07.156
But sculpt a little bit
of disrupted skin going arou,nd

16:07.192 --> 16:08.624
otherwise it's gonna look
like it's glued right smack

16:08.660 --> 16:09.759
on her face.
- Yeah, we need an entrance

16:09.794 --> 16:11.394
and an exit point.
- Exactly.

16:11.429 --> 16:12.862
Walter, let's see
what yr ounext piece is.

16:12.897 --> 16:14.263
- Let's see what's going on
over here.

16:14.299 --> 16:15.765
- Ooh, wow.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.634
I love everything you have
that's goi ongn around here.

16:18.670 --> 16:21.170
- Did your director say to you

16:21.206 --> 16:24.474
the kind of lighting style
he was going to be using?

16:24.509 --> 16:25.641
- He said it's gonna be
a lot of, like,

16:25.677 --> 16:26.976
slated shadow lighting.

16:27.011 --> 16:28.644
- So bear that in mind,

16:28.680 --> 16:31.180
because it can cast a shadow

16:31.216 --> 16:34.150
and this form
could create problems.

16:34.185 --> 16:37.019
- He really wants
to incorporate his symbol.

16:37.055 --> 16:38.187
- Right.

16:38.223 --> 16:39.889
- And we're not sure
whether to, like,

16:39.924 --> 16:43.259
do it on the forehead
or somewhere else.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.827
- Yeah, the chest
might be better.

16:44.863 --> 16:46.095
- Or even to one side.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.497
I wouldn't put it
straight in the middle,

16:47.532 --> 16:48.731
'cause if it's
right in the middle,

16:48.766 --> 16:50.032
it'll look like Superman.
- Power Rangers.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.068
- That's what I was thinking.
The superhero.

16:52.103 --> 16:53.436
He has to be a super demon.
- Yes, so somewhere...

16:53.471 --> 16:54.937
- Only if it's a lightning bolt.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.406
- Somewhere to one side.
- Okay, cool.

16:57.442 --> 16:59.242
- This is our possessed
character.

16:59.277 --> 17:01.611
When the wife destroys the doll,

17:01.646 --> 17:05.314
<i>the demon makes the husband</i>
<i>into the new doll.</i>

17:05.350 --> 17:06.849
- This is really so subtle.

17:06.885 --> 17:09.485
You need to give yourself
more exaggeration to it.

17:09.521 --> 17:10.486
- Okay.

17:10.522 --> 17:11.921
- I agree with Michael
completely,

17:11.956 --> 17:16.692
but I would actually cheat
and shift the shape of the eye,

17:16.728 --> 17:19.028
because otherwise,
you're going to be trapped

17:19.063 --> 17:21.164
by the actors own shape.
- Yeah.

17:21.199 --> 17:22.665
- Do you see what I mean?
- Yeah.

17:22.700 --> 17:23.966
- All right, let's see
what you got going on here.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.468
- So this is our demon.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.903
Instead of having,
like, an eye,

17:26.938 --> 17:28.471
<i>I wanted him to have</i>
<i>a lack of an eye</i>

17:28.506 --> 17:31.107
so he uses the doll
to see into our world.

17:31.142 --> 17:32.375
- What do you have
going on in the chin?

17:32.410 --> 17:33.976
- I don't know yet.
- You don't know, okay.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.845
- I just wanted  tito appear
like a strong jaw.

17:35.880 --> 17:36.946
atTh's all I've got so far.

17:36.981 --> 17:38.614
- Well, you do that
on your jawline.

17:38.650 --> 17:40.616
Now if you make that stronger
and you bring it in,

17:40.652 --> 17:42.318
then this won't look like it's,

17:42.353 --> 17:43.486
you know, sticking out on you.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.787
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:44.822 --> 17:46.255
- All right, everybody.
We're heading out.

17:46.291 --> 17:47.924

time management.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.458
Very important.

This one, more lumpy.

18:00.271 --> 18:01.671
- Okay.

18:01.706 --> 18:04.907
- Ryan wants the demon character

18:50.555 --> 18:51.954
<i>- Walking into the lab today,</i>

18:51.990 --> 18:54.857
I've decided to just resculpt
the entire demon face.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.426
The face is gonna have, like,
smaller eyes

18:57.462 --> 18:59.862
almost like a mole has with,
like, the circles around it,

18:59.897 --> 19:02.198
and we'll keep the circle theme
going throughout.

19:02.233 --> 19:03.799
Bryce's idea for this demon

19:03.835 --> 19:06.535
<i>is that it's</i>
<i>an underground dweller</i>

19:06.571 --> 19:09.972
with features that help it dig
through the Earth.

19:10.008 --> 19:11.474
Now that we have a direction,

19:11.509 --> 19:13.175
like,
in my head, we're good.

19:13.211 --> 19:14.877
- Okay.
- Way better than yesterday.

19:14.912 --> 19:16.312
Yesterday, I was like,
"What the hell is happening?"

19:16.347 --> 19:18.981
The top of the head has horns
in the shape of,

19:19.017 --> 19:20.549
<i>like, a cutting saw.</i>

19:20.585 --> 19:25.087
<i>It has very small mole-like</i>
<i>eyes, very pale, cracked skin.</i>

19:25.123 --> 19:28.090
<i>I'm thinking a rhino</i>
<i>has all three of those things.</i>

19:28.126 --> 19:31.060
That could be a cool place
to start at this face design.

19:31.095 --> 19:33.262
<i>¶ ¶</i>

19:33.298 --> 19:37.400
<i>I am getting the forms on there</i>
<i>and seeing this new shape,</i>

19:37.435 --> 19:39.502

19:50.481 --> 19:51.914
- I'll take him.
- Okay.

19:51.949 --> 19:53.749
<i>- Johnny has volunteered</i>
<i>to be in charge of molding,</i>

19:53.785 --> 19:57.486
<i>'cause he's the best molder.</i>

19:57.522 --> 19:59.255
And then I take over Sam's face

19:59.290 --> 20:01.090
<i>and Yvonne is continuing</i>
<i>to work on the cowl.</i>

20:01.125 --> 20:03.559
I'm feeling confident today
because we're in a good spot.

20:03.594 --> 20:09.532
<i>¶ ¶</i>

20:09.567 --> 20:11.734

<i>I'm going with the face,</i>

20:11.769 --> 20:13.869

20:13.905 --> 20:16.005
Each of these,
like, main bone groups

20:16.040 --> 20:17.673

like, a horn.

20:17.709 --> 20:19.975
We're trying to get horns

20:20.011 --> 20:21.277

20:21.312 --> 20:22.545

20:22.580 --> 20:24.146
Something kind of like that.

20:24.182 --> 20:28.250
A very asymmetric, spirally,
uneven horn that are very large

20:28.286 --> 20:31.053
that adds a lot of height
and bulk to this character.

20:31.089 --> 20:32.321
I like this shape.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.657
Just make his neck wider,
I guess, in the back.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.125
I'm so proud of my team.

20:45.903 --> 20:47.069

20:47.105 --> 20:48.838
into what I think
is the wood texture

20:48.873 --> 20:50.606
just so it looks
more like it's morphing.

20:50.641 --> 20:53.709
<i>- I know that Ryan</i>
<i>wants this symbol on the demon.</i>

20:53.745 --> 20:56.946
<i>But the faces are the focal</i>
<i>points of the makeups.</i>

20:56.981 --> 20:58.748
<i>So we need to</i>
<i>spend time on them</i>

20:58.783 --> 21:01.083
<i>because they need</i>
<i>to be perfect.</i>

21:01.119 --> 21:02.485

21:02.520 --> 21:04.353

of the final film shoot.

21:04.389 --> 21:07.923
I don't want to be redoing
a cowl or redoing a face

21:07.959 --> 21:11.193
because, you know,
Ryan wasn't happy with it.

21:11.229 --> 21:14.029
<i>I want him to be happy.</i>
<i>I want his vision to be seen.</i>

21:14.065 --> 21:15.331

- Yeah.

21:15.366 --> 21:19.235
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:19.270 --> 21:21.537

I want to remove his nipples

21:21.572 --> 21:24.940
and address this idea
that he's been summoned,

21:24.976 --> 21:27.076
so I want him to have
this symbol on him.

21:27.111 --> 21:28.477
<i>I'm sculpting out the symbol.</i>

21:28.513 --> 21:31.247
It's like a V-shape with circles
that go onto the pecs,

21:31.282 --> 21:32.748
an<i> d I'm not happy with it.</i>

21:32.784 --> 21:35.551
<i>It seems too simplistic</i>
<i>and it's not circular enough,</i>

21:35.586 --> 21:37.920
but I think it's important
to present John

21:37.955 --> 21:39.688
with something
for the lighting test,

21:39.724 --> 21:41.991
<i>so I can at leasdot  something</i>
<i>as a placeholder</i>

21:42.026 --> 21:45.060
to get us talking about it.

21:45.096 --> 21:52.935
<i>¶ ¶</i>

21:52.970 --> 21:55.471
<i>- We go to open</i>
<i>the cowl mold for the demon</i>

21:55.506 --> 21:57.807
and it comes apart
pretty easily.

21:57.842 --> 22:00.876

22:00.912 --> 22:03.746
But the head form

- Mmm.

22:09.854 --> 22:11.220
- [bleep].

22:11.255 --> 22:13.122
- This cowl's one of the biggest
parts of this makeup,

22:13.157 --> 22:15.157
<i>and it's just not coming out.</i>

22:15.193 --> 22:16.692
I just don't know
where all the suction is.

22:16.727 --> 22:20.763
We don't have the time
to scrap this cowl.

22:20.798 --> 22:23.899
<i>I'm afraid we're gonna</i>
<i>have to break part of it</i>

22:23.935 --> 22:26.602
to get this positive out.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.904
This mhtig cost me
this competition.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.387
- [bleep].

22:37.422 --> 22:39.389
- We're trying to pop
the back half of the demon cowl,

22:39.424 --> 22:40.490
<i>but it's locked.</i>

22:40.525 --> 22:42.058
Let me see if I can get it
from this angle.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.826
Lift that up as I do this.

22:43.862 --> 22:44.961
<i>We're fighting with this,</i>

22:53.338 --> 22:54.670
- I don't know.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.640
- Because it took so much force
to pull the positive out,

22:57.675 --> 23:00.009
<i>a portion of the mold</i>
<i>did crack.</i>

23:00.045 --> 23:02.512
That means a little bit
of repair later on.

23:02.547 --> 23:04.514
<i>But at least now,</i>
<i>we have all of our pieces.</i>

23:04.549 --> 23:06.082
<i>We can really make a game plan</i>

<i>I love going big and trying</i>
<i>to do more than everybody,</i>

23:22.033 --> 23:24.834
<i>but at the same time,</i>
<i>it's really tough,</i>

23:24.869 --> 23:26.602
so it's extremely important
to stay focused

23:26.638 --> 23:28.938
<i>and stick to the plan.</i>

<i>erosion of the skin</i>
<i>down into the body.</i>

23:39.918 --> 23:42.085
<i>I really want to show damage</i>
<i>over the heart</i>

23:42.120 --> 23:44.587
<i>that shows disease</i>
<i>got into the vascular system</i>

23:44.622 --> 23:46.756

spreading through the blood.

23:46.791 --> 23:49.759
<i>So I want to have the larger</i>
<i>diseased area over the heart</i>

23:49.794 --> 23:51.861
and then have it
spread out from there.

23:51.896 --> 23:54.997
Finally, I'm happy with my
pieces, so I decide to mold.

We look at our foam pieces,

25:46.110 --> 25:47.276
We're gonna have to patch it.

Oh, these edges are so bad.

<i>so Johnny's applying</i>
<i>the possessed makeup,</i>

26:15.840 --> 26:17.873
<i>Yvonne's taking point</i>
<i>on applying the baldap c</i>

26:17.909 --> 26:19.375
<i>to the demon,</i>

26:19.410 --> 26:21.210
<i>and I'm working on pre-painting</i>
<i>the cowl and the face</i>

26:21.246 --> 26:22.411
while they're doing that.

26:22.447 --> 26:25.181
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:25.216 --> 26:26.983
<i>- We have a lot of work</i>
<i>ahead of us,</i>

26:27.018 --> 26:30.519
so I immediately have Mel start
applying the possession makeup,

26:30.555 --> 26:33.522
<i>and then Robert takes the demon</i>
<i>into the mold room</i>

26:33.558 --> 26:35.358
to take casting of his teeth,

26:35.393 --> 26:36.826
au'cse I don't really want
anyone else seeing

26:36.861 --> 26:38.361
that that's what we're doing,

26:38.396 --> 26:39.962
<i>'cause I don't want to give</i>
<i>anybody else ideas.</i>

26:39.998 --> 26:41.931
- Okay, try not to bite so much.

26:41.966 --> 26:43.132
- [mumbling]

26:43.167 --> 26:45.067
- 'Cause you're biting
my finger.

26:45.103 --> 26:46.202
- The model
won't actually be able

26:46.237 --> 26:48.070
to wear the teeth
to the camera test,

26:48.106 --> 26:51.207
but the plan is to have
something for the final makeup

26:51.242 --> 26:53.209
<i>that will really make him</i>
<i>over the top</i>

26:53.244 --> 26:54.877
and hopefully give me
an advantage

26:54.912 --> 26:56.579
over the other contestants.

26:56.614 --> 26:59.615
<i>¶ ¶</i>

26:59.651 --> 27:01.150
- Try to get the glue
at least back to, like,

27:01.185 --> 27:02.652
two or three inches.
- Okay.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.220
<i>- We finally finish</i>
<i>getting everything</i>

27:04.255 --> 27:06.055
patched up and trimmed,

27:06.090 --> 27:08.257
<i>so now Anna is applying</i>
<i>the possession face</i>

27:08.293 --> 27:11.961
<i>and Kaleb is applying the cowl</i>
<i>while I start painting.</i>

27:11.996 --> 27:13.496
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:13.531 --> 27:15.831
<i>We are seriously under the gun.</i>

27:15.867 --> 27:17.233
- I got this side.

27:17.268 --> 27:18.467
- And I'm freaking out

27:18.503 --> 27:20.636
about everything
that I need to get done.

27:20.672 --> 27:22.705
<i>But we're working</i>
<i>really well together.</i>

27:22.740 --> 27:24.173
- Perfect.

27:24.208 --> 27:27.677
<i>- And I'm trexemely grateful</i>
<i>and thankful for that.</i>

27:27.712 --> 27:29.679
- How's that feel
on your nose there?

27:29.714 --> 27:30.980
- My nose is good.

27:31.015 --> 27:35.418
<i>¶ ¶</i>

27:35.453 --> 27:39.155
- You go with this color
on the tree side.

27:39.190 --> 27:40.423
- Yeah, okay.

27:40.458 --> 27:42.558
- And then I'll go on this seid
with this color.

27:42.593 --> 27:44.927
<i>The paint scheme</i>
<i>that I want to go with</i>

27:44.962 --> 27:47.930
is more pumpkin/gourd
on the gourd side

27:47.965 --> 27:50.032
<i>and then I'm gonna</i>
<i>go with the tree side</i>

27:50.068 --> 27:53.102
<i>in between really dark brown</i>
<i>and medium brown.</i>

27:53.137 --> 27:54.303
As I'm sponging,

27:54.339 --> 27:56.672
I tell Robert
to start throwing moss on him

27:56.708 --> 27:58.107
<i>and all of the sudden,</i>

27:58.142 --> 28:01.711
<i>Robert creates</i>
<i>the moss man prophecies.</i>

28:01.746 --> 28:04.980
<i>He's pulling apart moss</i>
<i>and gluing it in pcelas</i>

28:05.016 --> 28:06.716
<i>that I have thick edges.</i>

28:06.751 --> 28:09.018
<i>What he's doing with the moss</i>
<i>is really adding to my makeup</i>

28:09.053 --> 28:12.521
and is making it
look phenomenal.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.757
- I am just not
on my game today.

28:14.792 --> 28:17.626
Time is ticking away and we
still have a lot of work to do.

28:17.662 --> 28:19.261
<i>I do not think</i>
<i>I'm gonna get it all done,</i>

28:19.297 --> 28:21.597
and I'm really, really frazzled.

28:21.632 --> 28:23.366
<i>Now it's about prioritizing</i>

28:23.401 --> 28:25.234
and getting the best looking
makeup I can

28:25.269 --> 28:28.337
in the short amount of time.

28:28.373 --> 28:29.905
- 15 minutes.

28:29.941 --> 28:37.947
<i>¶ ¶</i>

28:39.117 --> 28:41.183
- That's time.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.351
<i>- I'm not thrilled.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:43.953
It's a really quick paint job.

28:43.988 --> 28:45.788
<i>It's not what it could be.</i>

28:45.823 --> 28:47.890
I've no idea what to expect
from the camera test,

28:47.925 --> 28:49.792
<i>which is definitely</i>
<i>nerve-racking.</i>

28:49.827 --> 28:52.061
<i>I hope that I make</i>
<i>a good impression.</i>

28:56.584 --> 28:59.552
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

28:59.587 --> 29:00.686
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:00.722 --> 29:02.321
- Johnny and I
are gonna work on you,

29:02.357 --> 29:03.723
and Yvonne's
gonna work on Matt.

29:03.758 --> 29:04.857
<i>Even though</i>
<i>it's only two makeups</i>

29:04.892 --> 29:06.258
<i>and we have three artists,</i>

29:06.294 --> 29:07.526
we're doing a lot of coverage.

29:07.562 --> 29:09.228
Both of our characters
are shirtless.

29:09.263 --> 29:11.497
We need paint on both of them.
There's a lot going on.

29:11.532 --> 29:13.265
Let me finish airbrushing you.

29:13.301 --> 29:14.767
<i>I start painting</i>
<i>these red circles,</i>

29:14.802 --> 29:16.502
<i>like, sort of the skin pattern.</i>

29:16.537 --> 29:19.238
I think it looks kind of cool.

29:19.273 --> 29:22.408
- We don't have teeth
for our demon,

29:22.443 --> 29:25.778
<i>so I take tooth black and just</i>
<i>paint it onto his teeth</i>

29:25.813 --> 29:28.981
to make them look sharper
and more jagged.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.984
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:32.020 --> 29:33.819
- It's very important
for these edges

29:33.855 --> 29:35.354
<i>to be wndo</i>
<i>for this possession character,</i>

29:35.390 --> 29:36.989
<i>just because</i>
<i>this is gonna be filmed.</i>

29:37.025 --> 29:38.391
It has to be seamless.

29:38.426 --> 29:40.359
- Melissa, do you want
the oil dripping out?

29:40.395 --> 29:41.727
- Dripping would be good.
- Okay.

29:41.763 --> 29:44.063
- 15 minutes.

29:44.098 --> 29:52.405
<i>¶ ¶</i>

29:52.440 --> 29:55.107
- Time's up, guys.
You're needed on set.

29:55.143 --> 29:56.475
- Good job, you look terrible.

29:56.511 --> 29:57.710
<i>I'm very proud of my teammates.</i>

29:57.745 --> 29:59.512
They came together,
they worked really hard.

29:59.547 --> 30:01.147
<i>But I'm the lead.</i>

30:01.182 --> 30:03.949
It's ultimately my vision
that they're bringing to life.

30:03.985 --> 30:06.786
<i>So I think</i>
<i>I could have done better.</i>

30:08.623 --> 30:10.623
<i>¶ ¶</i>

30:10.658 --> 30:12.024
<i>I'm very much looking forward</i>

30:12.060 --> 30:13.559
<i>to seeing the makeups</i>
<i>on camera.</i>

30:13.594 --> 30:15.594
But walking to the stage
is kind of embarrassing,

30:15.630 --> 30:17.663
<i>'cause we definitely</i>
<i>need to make improvements.</i>

30:17.698 --> 30:20.232
So I hope the director
won't be too harsh on us.

30:20.268 --> 30:22.201
Hey!

30:22.236 --> 30:25.304
Hello.
- Hello!

30:25.339 --> 30:26.772
<i>- We walk into the stage,</i>

30:26.808 --> 30:29.108
and I'm just like, "Holy crap,
I'm in over my head."

30:29.143 --> 30:31.143
<i>There's just</i>
<i>all this chaos going on</i>

30:31.179 --> 30:33.646
<i>with setting up the lighting,</i>
<i>the cameras, the monitors,</i>

30:33.681 --> 30:36.215
and even though I'm a little
scared, I'm super excited.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.150
- So let's get--
let's get right into it.

30:38.186 --> 30:39.251
The first thing we're gonna do

30:39.287 --> 30:40.753
is we're gonna put Jeff,
our demon,

30:40.788 --> 30:42.388
in the first setup
where the light is swinging.

30:42.423 --> 30:43.923
Things are looking good here,

30:43.958 --> 30:45.825
but let's see what it's like
under the real lights, okay?

30:45.860 --> 30:47.226
- All right.
- Cool, right over here, guys.

30:47.261 --> 30:49.728
<i>- I've only made makeups</i>
<i>seen in real life,</i>

30:49.764 --> 30:52.031
and here we're gonna look at it
in a very different fashion,

30:52.066 --> 30:55.234
and I have no idea
what to expect.

30:55.269 --> 30:56.735
- This is a good thing
for us to see now.

30:56.771 --> 30:57.970
You'll get to actually see

30:58.005 --> 30:59.472
the lighting setup
we're thinking about,

30:59.507 --> 31:01.841
so that's what we need to look
at is these little creases

31:01.876 --> 31:03.943
and stuff that may be giving
away some of the secrets.

31:03.978 --> 31:06.512
- It's really cool
to see this though.

31:06.547 --> 31:07.880
<i>When I see the demon on camera,</i>

31:07.915 --> 31:10.649
<i>it's so cool to just see it</i>
<i>in a video.</i>

31:10.685 --> 31:12.852
It's right there,
but it's a movie.

31:12.887 --> 31:14.220
- Before we call, "Action,"

31:14.255 --> 31:16.989
will you just tap the light
for me so it's swinging?

31:17.024 --> 31:19.725
And action.

31:19.760 --> 31:22.128
So even there, like, if
his fierngtips are glistening.

31:22.163 --> 31:24.897
Maybe, like, the front part here
is glistening a little bit.

31:24.932 --> 31:26.432
Yeah, this isn't quite right.

31:26.467 --> 31:27.833
Yeah, we'll work on this.

31:27.869 --> 31:29.268
<i>- John doesn't like</i>
<i>the chest piece.</i>

31:29.303 --> 31:30.436
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>the chest piece.</i>

31:30.471 --> 31:31.804
No one likes the chest piece.

31:31.839 --> 31:34.874
- Be careful that when we create
the oil congmi out of him

31:34.909 --> 31:36.809
that it doesn't look
like he's lactating.

31:36.844 --> 31:37.977
- Yeah, that was a concern.
- You know what I'm saying?

31:38.012 --> 31:39.178
Right.
- Maybe if we put

31:39.213 --> 31:40.179
the designs higher.
- Yeah.

31:40.214 --> 31:42.148
- The chest piece
looks terrible.

31:42.183 --> 31:43.549
<i>It's a little bit of a bummer</i>

31:43.584 --> 31:45.618
<i>because this is definitely not</i>
<i>the first impression</i>

31:45.653 --> 31:47.453
I wanted to give the director.

31:47.488 --> 31:49.522
- Slowly open your mouth, Jeff.

31:49.557 --> 31:51.891
Maybe if we can make it
so when he opens his mouth,

31:51.926 --> 31:53.192
something is coming out of it.

31:53.227 --> 31:55.194
It's almost like a little goo--
- Chocolate syrup.

31:55.229 --> 31:57.229
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.
It's coming out of him.

31:57.265 --> 31:59.598
- If we have more
of the mouth oil,

31:59.634 --> 32:00.866
go--go ahead
and give him that.

32:00.902 --> 32:02.868
- Yeah, let's just try it, yeah.
- Yeah.

32:02.904 --> 32:05.237
- And action.

32:05.273 --> 32:06.839
- Yeah, see--
- Oh, so gross.

32:09.143 --> 32:09.709
- See, that's what we want.
That's what we need right there.

32:09.710 --> 32:10.276
- YeOkay.ee--
- Oh- Yeah.oss.

32:10.311 --> 32:11.911
- Other thing
we should probably do here,

32:11.946 --> 32:14.880
is really make his eye area
as red as possible.

32:14.916 --> 32:16.415
Everything else
is great being muted,

32:16.450 --> 32:18.350
but that needs to pop on camera.

32:18.386 --> 32:19.985
- There's some flaws,

32:20.021 --> 32:21.987
<i>but he's verhay ppy with our</i>
<i>demon face, our demon cowl,</i>

32:22.023 --> 32:24.557
so we don't have to resculpt
those, which is a huge relief.

32:24.592 --> 32:26.091
[laughs]

32:26.127 --> 32:27.359
- Let's have Sam fly in

32:27.395 --> 32:30.229
and let's give Jeff
a-a few minutes off.

32:30.264 --> 32:31.997
And action.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.967
Look up towards the camera.

32:35.002 --> 32:37.169
Tilt your head
towards the light.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.437
When he gets revealed,

32:38.472 --> 32:40.973
we need to move this makeup
on his chest further up

32:41.008 --> 32:42.575
to his shoulder.
- Okay.

32:42.610 --> 32:45.744
- And even if it does creep up
on to his up here, that's fine,

32:45.780 --> 32:47.846
because that will give me
more of a reveal.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.250
Now raise your right arm up,
as if you were asking for help.

32:51.285 --> 32:52.985
We need to build
some sort of appliance,

32:53.020 --> 32:55.221
more about his hand
versus his arm,

32:55.256 --> 32:57.289
that it looks like
he's becoming Mr. Sticks.

32:57.325 --> 32:59.825
<i>- John wants more with Sam.</i>

32:59.860 --> 33:01.093
So that's the big thing.

33:01.128 --> 33:02.294
- Maybe where his fingers are,

33:02.330 --> 33:03.729
you can have branches
shooting off of it.

33:03.764 --> 33:04.930
- I'm feeling a little
overwhelmed

33:04.966 --> 33:06.265
because it's a lot of changes,

33:06.300 --> 33:08.133
<i>but the camera test</i>
<i>is really helpful</i>

33:08.169 --> 33:11.537
because it makes what changes
we need to make very apparent.

33:11.572 --> 33:13.305
- All right, so you guys
did a great job today.

33:13.341 --> 33:14.506
Next time I see you though,

33:14.542 --> 33:15.541
will be on set.

33:15.576 --> 33:16.709
- Hard core.
- All right.

33:16.744 --> 33:18.310
Okay, so we're all there.
Get out of here.

33:18.346 --> 33:19.445
Give me a hug
and get out of here.

33:19.480 --> 33:20.546
All right.
Thank you, guys.

33:20.581 --> 33:21.914
<i>- I really want</i>
<i>to win "Face Off,"</i>

33:21.949 --> 33:24.683
but what I presented to John
was not great.

33:24.719 --> 33:27.486
So I need to step it up
and really bring my A game.

33:27.521 --> 33:35.160
<i>¶ ¶</i>

33:35.196 --> 33:36.762
- So the first thing
is Robert and I

33:36.797 --> 33:39.865
will be attacking the paint job
onhe t demon makeup

33:39.900 --> 33:43.202
<i>and Mel needs to tie up loose</i>
<i>ends with the possessed makeup.</i>

33:43.237 --> 33:46.472
- This got too muddy.
It's my fault, but it got bad.

33:46.507 --> 33:48.140
I put some alcohol on a sponge,

33:48.175 --> 33:50.643
and I'm just trying to get back
some of that red tone

33:50.678 --> 33:53.178
and 'sit pulling up my edges
and bunching them

33:53.214 --> 33:55.214
because of all the alcohol
and cream makeups.

33:55.249 --> 33:56.949
It's just a big, muddy mess.

33:56.984 --> 33:59.652
Gonna make you not look dead.

33:59.687 --> 34:03.188
- I am bouncing back and forth
from dry brushing to abrirushing

34:03.224 --> 34:07.493
<i>while Robert is laying foliage</i>
<i>all over the demon makp.eu</i>

34:07.528 --> 34:09.295
<i>- I don't want to see</i>
<i>a hand with fingernails,</i>

34:09.330 --> 34:11.997
so I just moss all over it.

34:12.033 --> 34:14.533
I'm mossing all out.

34:14.568 --> 34:17.202
<i>- Mel and Robert are bringing</i>
<i>elements to my makeup</i>

34:17.238 --> 34:18.704
that I would've
never had by myself

34:18.739 --> 34:20.973
<i>and I'm extremely</i>
<i>grateful for it.</i>

34:21.008 --> 34:22.975
- 15 minutes!

34:23.010 --> 34:30.983
<i>¶ ¶</i>

34:31.018 --> 34:34.420
- Hey, guys, time is up.
You're needed on set.

34:34.455 --> 34:35.988
<i>- Time's up,</i>
<i>brushes are down,</i>

34:36.023 --> 34:37.856
<i>and I feel so confident.</i>

34:37.892 --> 34:40.259
This is by far
the coolest thing I've done,

34:40.294 --> 34:43.162
<i>and I'm extremely proud</i>
<i>of the teammates that I have.</i>

34:43.197 --> 34:44.697
This is finale-worthy, I think.

34:44.732 --> 34:46.432
Looking awesome.

34:49.737 --> 34:51.737
<i>I love my makeups,</i>
<i>but I'm nervous</i>

34:51.772 --> 34:54.406
because only Ryan's opinion
really matters

34:54.442 --> 34:55.774
<i>at the camera test.</i>

34:55.810 --> 34:57.543
<i>$100,000 is on the line.</i>

34:57.578 --> 34:58.977
- This is so crazy.

34:59.013 --> 35:00.412
<i>- I hope that he likes it</i>

35:00.448 --> 35:02.681
<i>because I definitely</i>
<i>don't want to start over.</i>

35:09.624 --> 35:12.892
- I love my makeups,
but $100,000 is on the line

35:12.927 --> 35:15.261
<i>and only Ryan's opinion</i>
<i>really matters.</i>

35:15.296 --> 35:16.796
- What's up, guys?
- Hey.

35:16.831 --> 35:18.064
- Whoo!

35:18.099 --> 35:19.232
- Hello.

35:19.267 --> 35:20.900
- Oh, my God.

35:20.935 --> 35:22.769
Ah!

35:22.804 --> 35:24.937
You guys have been killing it.
This looks awesome.

35:24.973 --> 35:26.773
Let's put some lights on it,
see how it looks.

35:26.808 --> 35:29.475
- Ryan seems like he's
overwhelmed with excitement,

35:29.511 --> 35:31.210
<i>but now I'm gonna</i>
<i>have to see these makeups</i>

35:31.246 --> 35:32.578
<i>in front of the camera,</i>

35:32.614 --> 35:34.080
so I really hope
he's gonna be pleased with it.

35:34.115 --> 35:37.183
- Let's do it.
All right, cool.

35:37.218 --> 35:41.087
Action.

35:41.122 --> 35:42.288
Terrence, can I see
what it looks like

35:42.323 --> 35:43.589
when you look
around the room more,

35:43.625 --> 35:44.757
like you've just come up

35:44.793 --> 35:46.559
and you're sort of
taking in the space?

35:46.594 --> 35:48.861
Lean in real close.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.329
Man, he's awesome.

35:50.365 --> 35:52.832
- It's absolutely wonderful
seeing my makeup on film.

35:52.867 --> 35:56.436
<i>Under the light, hearing Ryan</i>
<i>tell him exactly what to do,</i>

35:56.471 --> 35:58.037
such a cool experience, man.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.205
loI ved being on set.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.540
- Cut.
That's great.

36:00.575 --> 36:02.575
I don't have a lot of notes,
guys.

36:02.610 --> 36:04.510
It looks really good.
- Yeah?

36:04.546 --> 36:05.978
- Yeah, I'm really,
really happy with it.

36:06.014 --> 36:07.547
The only thing I would say
is the vines,

36:07.582 --> 36:08.881
those are just temp, right?

36:08.917 --> 36:10.516
- So those are just
so that you see...

36:10.552 --> 36:11.751
- Got ya.
- We're gonna do that there,

36:11.786 --> 36:13.853
and then gonna want to wrap him
with more vines.

36:13.888 --> 36:15.421
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.
- And they'll be painted.

36:15.457 --> 36:18.024
- Yeah, and they'll be painted.
- You are awesome.

36:18.059 --> 36:19.325
- Good job, man.

36:19.360 --> 36:21.160
- Let me check on lighting.
Here, one second.

36:21.196 --> 36:23.996
- The one thing I'm seeing
is his nose.

36:24.032 --> 36:26.032
This little shine
coming out here.

36:26.067 --> 36:28.067
That makes it almost
look like a pixie nose.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.269
- I got ya.
- Right there.

36:30.305 --> 36:31.971
That's where light's
bouncing out of,

36:32.006 --> 36:33.773
and this little spot right here.
- Mm-hmm.

36:33.808 --> 36:37.243
- Those two little spots
are gonna be headlights.

36:37.278 --> 36:40.213
<i>- The changes are minimal,</i>
<i>and it's such a good feeling</i>

36:40.248 --> 36:42.815
<i>knowing that my director</i>
<i>is happy with the demon.</i>

36:42.851 --> 36:46.018
I just hope he feels the same
about the possesonsi makeup.

36:46.054 --> 36:47.353
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

36:47.388 --> 36:48.688
- My lady.

36:48.723 --> 36:50.890
[laughs]

36:50.925 --> 36:52.225
Yeah, that's good.

36:52.260 --> 36:54.026
That's pretty creepy, guys.

36:54.062 --> 36:55.128
We'll shoot it.

36:55.163 --> 36:56.829
- Here we go.
Let's go camera, please.

36:56.865 --> 36:59.966
- Action.

37:00.001 --> 37:01.434
Megan, can you, like,
sort of grab

37:01.469 --> 37:02.869
at his shoulders, you know,
almost like--

37:02.904 --> 37:04.971
like you're trying to pull
yourself up to him?

37:05.006 --> 37:07.974
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

37:08.009 --> 37:09.675
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:09.711 --> 37:11.811
All right, cut.

37:11.846 --> 37:13.813
Okay, final powwow.

37:13.848 --> 37:15.781
Is there a way
that we can take down

37:15.817 --> 37:18.217
some of the intensity
of this area?

37:18.253 --> 37:20.186
- Oh, yeah, I can cut this down

37:20.221 --> 37:22.088
so that is shows her face more.

37:22.123 --> 37:23.422
- Yeah, I think
it would be nice to see,

37:23.458 --> 37:25.158
like, maybe more of her.

37:25.193 --> 37:27.260
<i>- Ryan's only notes</i>
<i>on the possessed makeup</i>

37:27.295 --> 37:29.595
is that he would like
to scale it back a little,

37:29.631 --> 37:31.063
<i>so thas t'actually good.</i>

37:31.099 --> 37:33.699
<i>That's less work for us to do</i>
<i>during the film shoot.</i>

37:33.735 --> 37:35.001
- I love the makeup.

37:35.036 --> 37:36.269
I can't wait to see
what you guys do with it.

37:36.304 --> 37:37.970
I don't--
I mean, it's already so good.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.039
I don't know how you did it
as fast as you did.

37:40.074 --> 37:41.707
<i>- Even though the camera test</i>
<i>went well,</i>

37:41.743 --> 37:43.309
I still have
a lot of work to do.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.911
<i>I want to win</i>
<i>more than anything,</i>

37:44.946 --> 37:46.779
and I got to step it up
even more.

37:46.814 --> 37:48.381
<i>I just want bigger and better,</i>

37:48.416 --> 37:51.684
so I'm just full speed ahead
on this one.

37:51.719 --> 37:59.525
<i>¶ ¶</i>

37:59.561 --> 38:01.827
- We get to Last Looks
and we have one more hour

38:01.863 --> 38:04.197
<i>to make these makeups</i>
<i>finale-worthy.</i>

38:04.232 --> 38:06.599
My sole attention
needs to be on this demon.

38:06.634 --> 38:09.202
These eye edges
are not going down.

38:09.237 --> 38:12.838
The cowl is so heavy
it's pushing his face forward.

38:12.874 --> 38:15.441
And it's keeping the appliance
from sticking to his skin.

38:15.476 --> 38:19.045
So the first thing I need to do
is get those eye edges down.

38:19.080 --> 38:21.814
Next time, we have to set the
cowl back a little bit further

38:21.849 --> 38:23.883
so we can pull the face tighter.

38:23.918 --> 38:25.885
- Keep them closed for me.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.520
I continue on
with the possession makeup,

38:27.555 --> 38:30.423
<i>putting oil in her hair</i>
<i>and on her hands.</i>

38:30.458 --> 38:32.625
<i>It should really</i>
<i>give that creepy,</i>

38:32.660 --> 38:35.928
oily look that Bryce wants.

38:35.964 --> 38:39.065
<i>- Rob and arI e drenching</i>
<i>our character in oil.</i>

38:39.100 --> 38:41.667
We're throwing dust everywhere.

38:41.703 --> 38:43.302
<i>We've really got to make sure</i>
<i>this guyoo lks like</i>

38:43.338 --> 38:44.971
he's coming up
from out of the ground.

38:45.006 --> 38:46.539
We got 15 minutes left.
- Okay.

38:46.574 --> 38:54.580
<i>¶ ¶</i>

38:56.050 --> 38:59.552
- Hey, guys, time is up.
You're needed on set.

38:59.587 --> 39:01.354
- I think
they both look stunning.

39:01.389 --> 39:03.322
- You guys look so good.
It's ridiculous.

39:03.358 --> 39:04.357
- Ah!

39:04.392 --> 39:06.025
And I'm really excited to see

39:06.060 --> 39:07.960
how these really cool makeups
are gonna look

39:07.996 --> 39:10.029
<i>under realistic lighting</i>

39:10.064 --> 39:12.064
and I'm excited to get
the critiques that we need

39:12.100 --> 39:13.899
to make this
an even better makeup.

39:17.138 --> 39:18.371
Come on, guys.

39:18.406 --> 39:21.173
To have a camera test
is invaluable,

39:21.209 --> 39:24.277
<i>and I think my makeups look</i>
<i>alrely cool.</i>

39:24.312 --> 39:26.779
But at the same time,
I am terrified

39:26.814 --> 39:28.981
<i>to see how Bryce reacts.</i>

39:29.017 --> 39:31.851
It's a roller coaster
of emotion.

39:31.886 --> 39:33.486
Hi!
- There you are!

39:33.521 --> 39:35.054
Bring 'em in.

39:35.089 --> 39:37.690
<i>- The sound stage</i>
<i>is just unbelievable.</i>

39:37.725 --> 39:39.058
Itee fls like
a real movie shoot.

39:39.093 --> 39:40.760
- So these guys are--

39:40.795 --> 39:42.495
I'm just gonna stand over here
'cause they're terrifying me.

39:42.530 --> 39:44.664
But let's see
how they look on camera.

39:44.699 --> 39:46.465
We're just gonna come
right this way.

39:46.501 --> 39:47.633
Action.

39:47.669 --> 39:52.638
<i>¶ ¶</i>

39:52.674 --> 39:55.141
Just settle and hold there,
and look straight down.

39:55.176 --> 39:56.442
Yeah, like that.

39:56.477 --> 39:58.077
<i>- It's so cool</i>
<i>to see it in the monitor.</i>

39:58.112 --> 40:00.012
It is truly terrifying.

40:00.048 --> 40:01.714
- His eyes almost disappear.

40:01.749 --> 40:03.349
We could probably pinpoint
a little light there,

40:03.384 --> 40:04.483
so we get a little bit
of reflection.

40:04.519 --> 40:06.686
We do see there are eyes.

40:06.721 --> 40:09.922
Give me that tilt up
so we can see the whole body.

40:09.957 --> 40:13.526
The hands could
be more shovel-like.

40:13.561 --> 40:14.927
- Okay.
- Exaggerated.

40:14.962 --> 40:16.929
What's really designed for,
like, digging out dirt.

40:16.964 --> 40:20.733
- I think it looks really good,
but Bryce has some problems.

40:20.768 --> 40:22.468
- The color could be more pale,

40:22.503 --> 40:24.804
more crushed shell,
white powder,

40:24.839 --> 40:26.772
'cause I think it's gonna
make that contrast

40:26.808 --> 40:28.107
just pop a little bit harder.

40:28.142 --> 40:29.141
- Okay.

40:29.177 --> 40:30.876
- Cod ulyou tilt
your head down for us?

40:30.912 --> 40:32.211
Yeah, we just want to see
the top of his head, Bruce.

40:32.246 --> 40:34.180
We're looking at those horns
right there.

40:34.215 --> 40:35.815
It feels like
it's all kind of starting

40:35.850 --> 40:37.650
at the same kind of place
on the head.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.352
Maybe some of 'em are starting
further back on the head,

40:39.387 --> 40:41.320
like, back on, like, the kind
of back of the skull there.

40:41.356 --> 40:43.189
<i>- There's a lot of changes</i>
<i>that he wants.</i>

40:43.224 --> 40:44.623
<i>And that's not</i>
<i>what I want to hear,</i>

40:44.659 --> 40:47.259
because each change
just adds more time

40:47.295 --> 40:48.327
that I have to keep sculpting.

40:48.363 --> 40:50.429
You wanted to change the nose?
- Yeah.

40:50.465 --> 40:51.731
- And the color.
- Color.

40:51.766 --> 40:53.299
- I'm starting to get
a little worried.

40:53.334 --> 40:55.868
- If you guys find a way
to embed

40:55.903 --> 40:58.104
natural elements
from the location.

40:58.139 --> 41:01.507
- Bryce is adding a lot
to to my list of to-dos.

41:01.542 --> 41:05.277
- Is there a way to make
the ear hole more of a he?ol

41:05.313 --> 41:09.181
- This is my
worst-case scenario.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.589
- Maybe some of 'em are starting
further back on the head,

41:16.625 --> 41:17.957
like, back of the skull there.

41:17.993 --> 41:19.993
- Bryce has a lot of new ideas
for this demon.

41:20.028 --> 41:22.429
- If you guys find a way
to embed

41:22.464 --> 41:25.298
natural elements from the
location, that would be cool.

41:25.333 --> 41:28.368
- This is my
worst-case scenario.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.371
<i>It means having to resculpt</i>
<i>the cowl and the face piece.</i>

41:31.406 --> 41:32.739
- So I trust you guys
to do this.

41:32.774 --> 41:34.007
I'm excited to see it.

41:34.042 --> 41:35.875
- I do think these ideas
are really cool,

41:35.911 --> 41:38.778
but they're gonna create
a lot more work.

41:38.814 --> 41:41.381
- Let's go ahead and get him out
and let's get Kaya.

41:41.416 --> 41:44.017
Let's look on the monitor
and see what she looks like.

41:44.052 --> 41:45.585
Okay, action.

41:45.620 --> 41:48.588
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

41:48.623 --> 41:50.256
<i>¶ ¶</i>

41:50.292 --> 41:52.025
- That looks really creepy.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.960
- Okay, let's cut.
Let's cut.

41:53.995 --> 41:55.328
So here's what needs to happen.

41:55.363 --> 41:57.564
So let's think about
scaling it back.

41:57.599 --> 42:00.100
It's too extreme.

42:00.135 --> 42:02.435
'Cause I don't think
she's turning into him.

42:02.471 --> 42:04.504
I think that whatever
this demonic spirit is,

42:04.539 --> 42:06.706
his effect is more
of an unconscious thing

42:06.741 --> 42:08.608
that's not really
manifesting physically

42:08.643 --> 42:10.810
as in extreme a way
as it is right now.

42:10.846 --> 42:12.112
<i>- So now Bryce is not happy</i>

42:12.147 --> 42:13.580
<i>with the possession makeup</i>
<i>either.</i>

42:13.615 --> 42:16.382
I'm fighting the urge
to pass out at this point.

42:16.418 --> 42:17.717
- What's your thoughts?

42:17.752 --> 42:19.786
- Is it all one piece?
- It ends--yeah, it ends here.

42:19.821 --> 42:21.254
- It's a face?
- Yeah.

42:21.289 --> 42:23.756
- So then you're going back
to square one.

42:23.792 --> 42:26.693
<i>- It's really hard to go into</i>
<i>the camera test ryve confident</i>

42:26.728 --> 42:28.061
and then be totally blindsided.

42:28.096 --> 42:30.263
- I want that to be
a clean enough palette

42:30.298 --> 42:32.832
that that oil dripping
really, like, pops.

42:32.868 --> 42:34.601
<i>- This isn't a few touchups.</i>

42:34.636 --> 42:37.003
We have to redesign both faces
from scratch,

42:37.038 --> 42:39.172
