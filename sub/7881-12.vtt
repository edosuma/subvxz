00:32.291 --> 00:35.834
Oh Stan, this trip could not
have come at a better time.

00:35.875 --> 00:39.125
Our lives have
been so dull lately.

00:39.166 --> 00:40.375
I'm not gonna lie.

00:40.417 --> 00:42.041
I started stealing again

00:42.083 --> 00:45.709
and I came real close
to cutting myself.

00:45.750 --> 00:48.417
Anyway, I guess
I'm just trying to say,

00:48.458 --> 00:51.083
thanks for the
surprise trip to Hawaii.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.125
And the surprises
don't stop there

00:53.166 --> 00:55.917
because we're actually
going to Sacramento.

00:55.959 --> 00:57.959
Sacramento?!

00:58.000 --> 01:00.417
That's so... boring!

01:00.458 --> 01:02.792
Boring? But honey,
Sacramento is broken up

01:02.834 --> 01:04.166
into four different areas.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.458
Area one.

01:05.500 --> 01:06.458
Area two.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.458
Area three.

01:07.500 --> 01:08.750
Area four.

01:08.792 --> 01:10.542
Doesn't that sound insane?!

01:15.125 --> 01:17.083
So, then I told him,
"I like my men

01:17.125 --> 01:18.583
"like I like my coffee:

01:18.625 --> 01:20.417
in an extra-large cup."

01:20.458 --> 01:22.291
Ooh.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.875
Oh, Margie, you gotta stop
pounding so much...

01:25.917 --> 01:26.959
...coffee!

01:27.000 --> 01:28.208
Wink!

01:28.250 --> 01:30.959
Ooh! Look at those girls.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.291
They certainly seem
to be having fun.

01:33.333 --> 01:35.250
I know, they're fabulous.

01:35.291 --> 01:36.375
If we're looking for fun,

01:36.417 --> 01:38.834
maybe we need to take a page
from their book.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.417
Or, maybe it's time for you
to write a book of your own.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.709
Oh, my God.
They're talking to us.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.417
We knew you were
listening to us.

01:45.458 --> 01:46.417
We don't mind.

01:46.458 --> 01:47.333
We like it.

01:47.375 --> 01:49.333
We're four
high-flying gals

01:49.375 --> 01:50.792
who like to have fun.

01:50.834 --> 01:53.208
We give a whole new
meaning to "Red Eye."

01:54.583 --> 01:56.667
I'm not sure I get that,
but I know it's filthy.

01:56.709 --> 01:59.792
You girls should have
your own TV show!

01:59.834 --> 02:01.667
People tell us that
all the time.

02:01.709 --> 02:02.834
But I can assure you,

02:02.875 --> 02:04.667
we're not simple
TV caricatures,

02:04.709 --> 02:07.291
we're real people
with hopes and dreams.

02:07.333 --> 02:09.667
I'm Angie,
I'm in it for money.

02:12.542 --> 02:16.041
I'm Christy,
I'm in it for adventure!

02:18.709 --> 02:21.375
I'm Margie,
I'm in it for love.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.125
I'm Denise,
I'm in it to avenge my father.

02:37.834 --> 02:39.458
And together, we're...

02:39.500 --> 02:41.333
The Naughty Stewardesses!

02:43.083 --> 02:46.792
Those are some friendly skies.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.750
Oh, my God! Stan, you had
a piece of glass in your eye.

02:54.834 --> 02:58.041
I really appreciate you
doing my homework for me, Steve.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.083
Aw...

02:59.125 --> 03:00.750
I should be thanking you.

03:00.792 --> 03:03.125
I never knew how beautiful
the French language was,

03:03.166 --> 03:05.291
until I had to learn it
to do your homework.

03:05.333 --> 03:06.667
Merci.

03:06.709 --> 03:09.500
Sometimes I feel like I should
be doing my own homework,

03:09.542 --> 03:11.500
but then I'm like, nah.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.166
Did you like my story?

03:14.542 --> 03:17.917
Oh, that's my
boyfriend, Figgus.

03:17.959 --> 03:21.458
He says he wants to "fun me"
in his dad's toolshed.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.667
What does that mean?

03:22.709 --> 03:24.667
Uh... pretty sure
that's his auto-correct.

03:24.709 --> 03:28.417
Oh... that explains why his
"ditch pic" looks like this.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.417
Quit lookin'
at my ditch, nerd.

03:31.458 --> 03:33.792
There you are, silly.

03:34.917 --> 03:37.583
Still pining
after Jenna, I see.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.375
If you haven't closed
the deal with her by now

03:39.417 --> 03:40.667
you'll never close it.

03:40.709 --> 03:41.959
Easy, Barry.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.291
He'll make his move
when he's ready.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.834
Yeah. We nerds
have a long history

03:46.875 --> 03:48.917
of making our dream girls
fall for us.

03:48.959 --> 03:50.709
Like that kid in
Revenge of the Nerds,

03:50.750 --> 03:52.542
who finally won the heart
of that cheerleader.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.041
Oh, you mean the one who
put on a Darth Vader mask

03:55.083 --> 03:57.000
so he could rape her
at that carnival?

03:57.041 --> 03:58.041
Yep.

03:58.083 --> 03:59.417
Nah, never saw it.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.000
Yeah, Coach says
I gotta break up with you

04:04.041 --> 04:05.625
so I can focus on football.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.291
Did you do it?
Yes, sir!

04:08.333 --> 04:10.583
Good. 'Cause you players
won't look up to me

04:10.625 --> 04:12.375
if you're having sex
and I'm not.

04:12.417 --> 04:16.250
Now... who's house
am I sleeping at tonight?

04:16.291 --> 04:20.500
Oh, my God. Steve, looks like
Jenna's back on the market.

04:20.542 --> 04:23.125
This is the window
you've been waiting for!

04:23.166 --> 04:24.750
Yeah, it's perfect!

04:24.792 --> 04:27.417
You could ask her to the
"Winter Harvest" dance.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.250
H-h-h-hey-hey, Jenna.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.583
Uh, y-y-you okay?

04:40.625 --> 04:43.041
Figgus broke up with me.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.166
It hurts so bad.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.417
Why can't I ever
find a nice guy?

04:47.458 --> 04:49.542
I wish there was
somebody out there

04:49.583 --> 04:52.917
who'd ask me out
and take this pain away.

05:14.250 --> 05:17.375
Wow! I can't remember
the last time

05:17.417 --> 05:19.041
I had a Black Russian!

05:19.083 --> 05:21.166
I can.
Layover in Moscow.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.250
Ooh.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.625
Sounds like you got,
"laid-over."

05:26.709 --> 05:29.250
Don't try, Stan.
Just you be you.

05:29.291 --> 05:32.667
Oh, my God. Is that
Mark Cuban's bodyguard?

05:32.709 --> 05:35.083
Oh, and Mark Cuban!

05:35.125 --> 05:38.959
Yeah... last night,
he and Margie hooked up...

05:39.000 --> 05:42.083
until they were havin' sex.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.667
Margie, last night
was amazing.

05:44.709 --> 05:46.625
I want to finish
what we started.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.208
I'm thinkin' me, you,

05:48.250 --> 05:51.000
and a weekend at
my mansion in Monte Carlo.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.000
Oh, Cuban,
that sounds incredible,

05:53.041 --> 05:54.291
but I'm working
a flight to Miami

05:54.333 --> 05:56.291
which leaves in ten minutes.

05:56.333 --> 05:57.542
Unless...

05:57.583 --> 05:59.542
my new friends
Stan and Francine

05:59.583 --> 06:01.041
could cover for me.

06:01.083 --> 06:02.083
Would you...?

06:02.125 --> 06:03.709
Yes! Yes! Yes!
Oh, my God, Yes!

06:03.750 --> 06:07.583
Then I guess that makes you a
couple of Naughty Stewardesses.

06:12.417 --> 06:14.000
I'll see you guys later.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.166
Sounds good.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.959
And Margie, feel free
to move about the Cuban.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.750
The Cuban!

06:20.792 --> 06:21.792
Nice.

06:21.834 --> 06:22.875
Now you got it.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.458
All I needed was the pin!

06:34.250 --> 06:36.542
That's Gin.
You just gave me Gin.

06:36.583 --> 06:38.083
Why would you
discard a three?

06:38.125 --> 06:39.375
I don't know.

06:39.417 --> 06:40.709
I guess my head's not in it.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.166
Yeah, clearly.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.458
If I wanted to play a complete
moron, I'd play with Klaus.

06:44.500 --> 06:47.083
Burn, Steve!

06:47.125 --> 06:48.667
Look, what's
goin' on, Steve?

06:48.709 --> 06:49.667
Let's fix your head,

06:49.709 --> 06:51.500
so I can actually
have a game here.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.542
Well, you know that
beautiful girl, Jenna,

06:53.583 --> 06:55.041
I've kind of had my eye on?

06:55.083 --> 06:56.834
Is this the same girl
whose picture you put

06:56.875 --> 06:58.750
in your pajama bottoms
before you go to bed?

06:58.792 --> 06:59.959
You know about that?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.917
Who do you think takes
your pajamas off at night?

07:02.959 --> 07:04.250
Anyway...

07:04.291 --> 07:05.709
Jenna's my dream girl...

07:05.750 --> 07:06.875
but it doesn't matter now,

07:06.917 --> 07:09.208
because I missed
my window of opportunity.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.250
I had the perfect opening to
make her mine, but I wussed out!

07:12.291 --> 07:14.291
You wussed out?!

07:14.333 --> 07:15.917
You're better
than that, Steve.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.333
Did the Kennedys wuss out?

07:17.375 --> 07:19.667
No! They find a girl they like
and then they drown 'em.

07:19.709 --> 07:21.458
I guess you're right.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
Well, look,
I need my Gin partner back

07:23.542 --> 07:25.125
and if you're too chicken
to ask her out,

07:25.166 --> 07:26.291
why don't I do it for you?

07:26.333 --> 07:27.417
What do you mean?

07:27.458 --> 07:29.542
We need to surgically
switch faces,

07:29.583 --> 07:32.083
so I can pretend to be you
and win her heart.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.792
Then we'll switch back
and she's yours.

07:33.834 --> 07:36.000
Wait a minute.
Surgically switch faces?

07:36.041 --> 07:38.542
Why don't you just
put on one of your costumes?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.959
Yeah, I guess I could,
but I also got all these tools

07:41.000 --> 07:42.583
from my planet
in my junk drawer.

07:42.625 --> 07:43.625
Hold on.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.917
Are, are you, are you
sure about this?

07:49.959 --> 07:51.875
Uh, th-th-this
seems really dangerous.

07:51.917 --> 07:53.750
Calm down,
it's totally safe.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.500
How are you not dead?!

08:01.542 --> 08:03.583
Is, is my face off?

08:06.083 --> 08:08.583
Now, I just gotta
get mine off so we can swap.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.417
Oh, my God, the inside
of your face smells so bad!

08:21.625 --> 08:22.959
Oh, that's just Greek yogurt.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.125
I spilled some
in my eye socket yesterday

08:25.166 --> 08:26.333
and then I went in the sun.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.709
This is so freaky.

08:27.750 --> 08:28.917
You really think
this is gonna work?

08:28.959 --> 08:30.166
Sure!

08:30.208 --> 08:32.583
With your face on my face,
I'll be dragging Jenna

08:32.625 --> 08:33.875
into the creek behind school

08:33.917 --> 08:36.000
and harvesting
her organs in no time.

08:36.041 --> 08:37.875
No! That's not the plan!

08:37.917 --> 08:39.375
Okay, y-you should probably
write down

08:39.417 --> 08:40.917
what you want me to do.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.709
I hope this was
a good idea, Klaus.

08:47.750 --> 08:51.166
I'm trusting Roger not to screw
things up with my fantasy girl.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.000
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

08:53.041 --> 08:55.583
I'm sure Roger will be
a total gentleman.

08:56.417 --> 08:58.041
Woman, we need to talk.

08:58.083 --> 08:59.208
Oh, hi, Steve.

08:59.250 --> 09:01.000
Did you finish my homework?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.500
Yeah, I did some work at home.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.500
I battered my fish stick
to your candid in the yearbook.

09:05.542 --> 09:07.208
Now get over here
and put this hand

09:07.250 --> 09:09.166
in your back pocket
facing your ass.

09:09.208 --> 09:13.542
Steve! I didn't know
you were so... romantic.

09:16.417 --> 09:18.000
Your bottom's warm.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.375
Great job, guys.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.208
Let me know if you run
out of diet ginger ale.

09:25.250 --> 09:29.834
Thanks, Ange, but no one's
ever run out of diet ginger ale.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.166
This is so exciting.
I know!

09:32.208 --> 09:35.041
I just told someone to turn off
their phone and they did.

09:35.083 --> 09:38.458
Hey, how'd that joker in 3-C
board with a carry-on that big?

09:40.458 --> 09:41.583
Wait a minute.

09:41.625 --> 09:44.041
Isn't that
Mark Cuban's bodyguard?

09:44.083 --> 09:45.500
Why is he on this flight?

09:45.542 --> 09:48.583
Yeah. There's something
fishy about that guy.

09:48.625 --> 09:49.792
I think he may have had
something to do with

09:49.834 --> 09:51.250
my dad's death.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.625
You think that
about everyone, Denise.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.792
You know, he is clutching
that bag awfully close.

09:56.834 --> 09:58.417
I'm on it.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.375
Here, let me
help you stow that.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.417
No! The bag stays with me.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.166
We have to help Stan
get that bag.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.333
We need to create
a diversion,

10:11.375 --> 10:14.000
Naughty Stewardess style.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.458
Mini pillow fight!

10:25.667 --> 10:27.166
Can I stow that for you now?

10:27.208 --> 10:28.959
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.041
No! Ow!

10:35.667 --> 10:39.083
What is it?
It's plans to blow up the sun!

10:41.500 --> 10:45.166
Stan, I think that guy is
touching himself

10:45.208 --> 10:46.667
to the pillow fight.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.250
Oh, who me?

10:48.291 --> 10:51.917
No, I'm just thinking about
the sun blowing up.

10:51.959 --> 10:55.542
It's gonna be so... bright.

10:59.917 --> 11:01.166
Thanks for walking me home.

11:01.208 --> 11:03.291
I would have walked you home
but I didn't want to.

11:03.333 --> 11:04.458
I totally get it.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.166
So, I'll meet you at
the dance tonight?

11:06.208 --> 11:07.417
Yeah, you will.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.625
'Cause this is happening,

11:08.667 --> 11:09.542
you and me.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.875
Dare I say... us...?

11:11.917 --> 11:13.542
Be at the dance
at seven sharp.

11:13.583 --> 11:14.750
I'll be there
around nine.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.875
What...?

11:15.917 --> 11:16.917
This.

11:16.959 --> 11:20.041
Oh, mmm-mmm, oh, my God.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.250
Mmm, oh, this is so heavy.

11:22.291 --> 11:24.166
I'm so into this right now.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.500
So, did you get her?

11:33.542 --> 11:35.208
Oh, hey.
Yeah, yeah, I got her.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.875
She's a special gal, Steve.

11:36.917 --> 11:37.917
Great!

11:37.959 --> 11:39.834
So I guess it's time
to tag me back in?

11:39.875 --> 11:41.291
Yeah, the plan's changed.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.417
What?! Wh-what are you
talking about?

11:43.458 --> 11:44.583
I'm the one that got Jenna.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.375
I should be able
to take her to the dance.

11:46.417 --> 11:48.250
And spend the rest
of my life with her.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.000

th-this is my life.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.166

11:51.208 --> 11:52.750
Yeah, yeah you
make a good point.

11:52.792 --> 11:55.625
Okay, we'll switch faces
just as soon as I fix this lamp.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.458
What's wrong with it?
It's broken.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.166
Ah... shouldn't have
hit him in the face.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.458
That's my face.

♪ ♪

12:07.458 --> 12:09.375
I'm so happy
we're together now.

12:09.417 --> 12:13.375

such a cool guy under that face.

12:13.417 --> 12:15.917
I'm so glad
to hear you say that.

12:15.959 --> 12:18.250
I want to be with you
forever, Jenna.

12:18.291 --> 12:21.291
Me, too. But I have something
I need to tell you.

12:21.333 --> 12:24.709
Steve, I'm pregnant
with Figgus's baby.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.917
Huh?
When I told him about it,

12:26.959 --> 12:29.709
he just said he was late
for football practice.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.417
He doesn't care at all
and that really hurts.

12:32.458 --> 12:36.208
But now that I know you
want to be with me forever,

12:36.250 --> 12:38.625
everything's gonna
be all right.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.542
Right?
Of course.

12:40.583 --> 12:41.750
Oh, my God, of course.

12:41.792 --> 12:43.875
Excuse me,
I'll be right back.

12:50.000 --> 12:50.959
You wanted your life back.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.458
Well, here you go.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.000
Oh, and I got big news
on the Jenna front.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.542
Oh, thank God.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.166
It feels so good not to have
your disgusting skin touching

12:59.208 --> 13:00.875
my face muscles anymore.

13:00.917 --> 13:01.917
What's the big news?

13:01.959 --> 13:04.417
Your hatred of my skin
is news to me.

13:04.458 --> 13:06.333
No...! About Jenna,
you idiot.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.333
What did I miss?

13:07.375 --> 13:08.750
Wh-what do I need to know?

13:10.125 --> 13:12.625
Nothing.
She's totally into you

13:12.667 --> 13:14.125
and you should
hurry back to the dance,

13:14.166 --> 13:15.208
she's waiting for you.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.667
That's amazing, Roger!

13:16.709 --> 13:17.875
Thanks a lot.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.583
Wait, uh, there, there
might be one more thing.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.792
Oh, yeah, there is--
I owe you this.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.083
That was the thing.

13:25.125 --> 13:26.417
Run to her.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.250
I'm so nervous.

13:35.291 --> 13:36.917
I can't believe
you're not nervous.

13:36.959 --> 13:39.542
Nervous?! I'm excited
to meet your parents.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.250
I've never met
the parents before.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.709
I'm so glad I have you.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.375
When I told you it was time
to come clean to my parents

13:45.417 --> 13:48.417
about my baby,
you didn't even hesitate.

13:48.458 --> 13:52.083
Hey, if my baby wants to tell
the world about her baby,

13:52.125 --> 13:53.291
who am I to say no?

13:53.333 --> 13:55.834
You're so sweet.

13:55.875 --> 13:59.959
I don't even know what to tell
my parents about Figgus...

14:00.000 --> 14:01.333
Don't even mention him.

14:01.375 --> 14:02.959
Steve's here now.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000

Welcome to our home, son.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.917
We've heard such nice
things about you.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.208
The pleasure is all mine.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.834
Halfway there.
Still excited.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.083
Oh, my God!

14:32.125 --> 14:33.458
Darling,
are you all right?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.542
I-I'm fine. It's just
a little morning sickness.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.834
I didn't want it
to come out like this.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.542
But...
we're pregnant!

14:42.583 --> 14:43.417

14:43.458 --> 14:45.041
-What?!
-What?!

Steve!

14:46.083 --> 14:48.166
Don't play innocent now!

14:48.208 --> 14:50.166
You knocked up my baby girl?

14:50.208 --> 14:52.208
When I get down there,
I'm gonna murder you.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.375
Don't you move.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.041
You're pregnant?

14:57.083 --> 14:58.458
Oh, my God. He's got me!

14:58.500 --> 15:00.208
He's taking me up the stairs!

scribbled on
those blueprints,

15:11.625 --> 15:14.917

Cuban plans to blow up the sun.

15:14.959 --> 15:16.667
That's brilliant!

you're all right.

We found out that Mark Cuban
is trying to blow up the sun.

I left off an "s."
It's the "Suns."

been to the playoffs

16:06.166 --> 16:07.458

16:07.500 --> 16:09.166
I think this
could be their year.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.208
Well, having missiles
pointed at an entire NBA team

16:12.250 --> 16:13.417
is still pretty terrible.

16:13.458 --> 16:14.959
You know, I debated
whether I should say

16:15.000 --> 16:16.500
"blow up" in these plans?

16:16.542 --> 16:18.792
What I meant was, I'm going
to destabilize their franchise

16:18.834 --> 16:20.959
through swift and shrewd
free agency moves.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.625
But "blow up" sounds
way more exciting.

16:23.667 --> 16:25.417
Oh! But we do have an intern

16:25.458 --> 16:28.333
who's going to deflate their
basketballs before practice.

16:32.041 --> 16:34.458
Oh. I guess that's
not a problem then.

16:34.500 --> 16:35.959

perfectly legal.

16:37.542 --> 16:40.166
We don't care
if it is legal!

18:42.208 --> 18:44.500
Well, I think it's pretty
obvious what you need to do.

18:44.542 --> 18:46.792
You need to kick this bitch...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.291

19:23.375 --> 19:24.792
What's up, Coach?

19:24.834 --> 19:27.333
Figgus, remember how I said
I didn't want my players

19:27.375 --> 19:29.375
having sex if I
wasn't getting any?

19:29.417 --> 19:30.542
Well, forget that.

19:30.583 --> 19:32.375
Get back together
with your girlfriend.

19:32.417 --> 19:34.041
Okay, Coach!

19:34.083 --> 19:35.625
Does that mean you're
finally getting some?

19:35.667 --> 19:38.458
No... it's more that the school
board heard about my policy

19:38.500 --> 19:40.625
and apparently,
I'm not allowed to have it.

19:40.667 --> 19:43.917
Sometimes in life, you gotta
make half-time adjustments.

19:43.959 --> 19:46.083

with your girlfriend,

19:46.125 --> 19:48.250
raise your
baby together and...

19:48.291 --> 19:49.625
well, see you
at practice.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.250
And I hope you don't
drop that baby

19:51.291 --> 19:52.959

the football.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.917

the door on your way out.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.667
Okay, Coach, you can
have your face back

20:04.709 --> 20:06.166

two things:

20:06.208 --> 20:08.333
One, never say
anything about this.
