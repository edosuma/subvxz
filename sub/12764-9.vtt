00:00.399 --> 00:02.332
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.502 --> 00:05.512
- Why are you acting so weird?
- Nicole says it's 'cause I like you.

00:07.911 --> 00:09.618
- Don't you like me?
- Yeah, I do.

00:09.835 --> 00:13.142
You make fun of me, you put me down, and
you always have to have the last word.

00:13.365 --> 00:16.100
- I thought that was our thing.
- We have a thing?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.408
- I'm Adam Baylin.
- What do you want from me?

00:19.557 --> 00:22.376
- What would you like to know?
- ZZYZX was my conception, Kyle.

00:22.525 --> 00:25.772
You're saying I was gestated
inside one of those tanks at ZZYZX.

00:25.962 --> 00:27.001
So you created me.

00:27.199 --> 00:30.297
I worked security at ZZYZX for years!
I know every in and out.

00:30.495 --> 00:33.124
- There are innocents!
- They'd kill Baylin, they'll kill you!

00:36.661 --> 00:38.215
- Kyle, what's wrong?
- That's him.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.356
I am the only one that you can trust.

00:40.509 --> 00:41.993
- What did you see?
- Adam was there?

00:42.178 --> 00:43.406
- Baylin?
- He gave me this.

00:43.526 --> 00:47.109
The important thing now is trying
to figure out what the message is.

00:47.277 --> 00:48.662
Foss, I need to talk to you.

00:51.687 --> 00:52.811
What's going on?

00:52.985 --> 00:54.744
- Who the hell was that?
- Declan.

00:56.320 --> 00:58.652
I never thought I'd see
you deal with anything like this.

00:58.864 --> 01:01.738
Look, some coward jumped me. I'm not
gonna let him get the best of me.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.902
I think you can let
yourself freak out a little.

01:04.052 --> 01:07.173
- Her sole focus should be Kyle.
- She's been willful and defiant.

01:07.373 --> 01:10.129
She's a computer with a glitch.
Bring her in. We'll fix her.

01:10.424 --> 01:13.413
- Why did we come to your office?
- To get you some help.

01:13.693 --> 01:15.792
- You remember Mr. Ballantine?
- Hello, Jessi.

01:17.000 --> 01:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:27.869 --> 01:29.676
I got your message.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.456
- You're back.
- Anything come up?

01:35.357 --> 01:36.671
Where were you?

01:39.178 --> 01:41.582
You just took off and cleared
everything out of here.

01:41.775 --> 01:44.632
Well, I wasn't gonna
leave it just lying around.

01:46.431 --> 01:47.491
What is it?

01:48.837 --> 01:50.024
What happened?

01:56.270 --> 01:58.391
She was attacked two weeks ago.

02:00.331 --> 02:01.396
Attacked?

02:07.053 --> 02:08.285
You think...

02:11.523 --> 02:13.042
You think I did it?

02:17.302 --> 02:18.757
I wouldn't hurt her.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.491
Did you leave that warning for Declan?

02:22.435 --> 02:24.131
Only to keep him away, to protect you.

02:24.319 --> 02:26.374
By threatening my friend
and hurting my sister?

02:26.501 --> 02:28.092
I said I didn't do it.

02:30.377 --> 02:32.132
And how could you think that I would?

02:38.585 --> 02:39.600
That's from Baylin.

02:47.110 --> 02:48.494
Why would he leave that?

02:48.645 --> 02:50.786
I've been struggling with
that same question myself.

02:52.317 --> 02:54.225
You expect me to trust you?

02:54.895 --> 02:56.010
Tell me where you went.

03:02.968 --> 03:04.212
Let's get back to work.

03:12.309 --> 03:13.326
Wait!

03:17.019 --> 03:18.121
This is it?

03:19.343 --> 03:21.060
Just gonna walk on out?

03:22.258 --> 03:23.658
After everything?

03:27.342 --> 03:28.407
I'm sorry.

03:49.317 --> 03:51.589
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 2 Episode 9:
Ghost In The Machine</font>

05:16.929 --> 05:18.875
There's the genius at work.

05:19.764 --> 05:22.160
What kind of genius
plays with human life?

05:23.311 --> 05:25.771
Adam, you're trying
to better human life.

05:25.982 --> 05:27.932
At the cost of too many innocents.

05:29.041 --> 05:32.187
If this one doesn't survive
the extraction process,

05:32.641 --> 05:34.125
I'm shutting us down.

05:35.048 --> 05:36.384
Just like that?

05:43.780 --> 05:45.228
I'm sorry, Brian.

05:46.140 --> 05:48.472
I know how hard you've worked
to make this happen for me.

05:49.089 --> 05:50.470
You're damn right.

05:51.155 --> 05:52.799
I'm not gonna let you give up.

05:56.201 --> 05:57.813
This one's different.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.991
That boy of yours will be our salvation.

06:02.484 --> 06:03.616
Salvation.

06:04.814 --> 06:06.474
Your Bible is showing.

06:07.378 --> 06:09.986
Yeah, well ... old habits
die hard, right?

06:12.014 --> 06:14.410
Look, your friend Kern has, um,

06:14.928 --> 06:16.158
finally lost it.

06:17.825 --> 06:19.627
I already told you
I can't let you in there.

06:19.815 --> 06:22.106
- What are you talking about?
- I will not allow you

06:22.328 --> 06:23.992
to extract the subject.

06:24.754 --> 06:28.582
The subject is a person,
William! A child!

06:29.310 --> 06:31.275
You're letting your
emotions cloud your science.

06:31.423 --> 06:33.183
I thought I taught you better than that.

06:35.697 --> 06:37.880
- Adam.
- Get your hands off me.

06:38.620 --> 06:39.693
This is my company!

06:40.933 --> 06:42.956
Well, you're the only ones

06:43.104 --> 06:44.482
- who still think so.
- What?

06:45.910 --> 06:49.812
Let's just say your backers are
a little more motivated by my plan.

06:50.158 --> 06:51.158
Your plan?

06:51.440 --> 06:54.069
You were a frustrated
academic worried about tenure

06:54.208 --> 06:55.840
before Adam brought you in here.

06:56.380 --> 07:00.387
What I know is that
781227 is more valuable

07:00.601 --> 07:03.230
to this company if it remains inside.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.949
You can't keep him in
there like he's some machine.

07:06.802 --> 07:07.802
He is a person!

07:08.684 --> 07:10.066
A human being!

07:11.281 --> 07:13.416
Well, that's not how I see it.

07:15.541 --> 07:17.445
Then you and I have a problem.

07:34.643 --> 07:36.734
<i>Foss' words kept ringing in my head.</i>

07:36.923 --> 07:39.934
<i>He'd done so much for me,
and we'd been through so much together,</i>

07:40.122 --> 07:41.945
<i>it was hard for me
to accept his betrayal.</i>

07:42.163 --> 07:43.487
So how'd it go ?

07:45.964 --> 07:48.093
- We're done.
- Good riddance.

07:48.450 --> 07:49.637
Foss was bad news.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.402
- I know you don't like him, but...
- What?

07:52.976 --> 07:55.718
He threatened to hurt Lori
and then she gets beat up.

07:56.022 --> 07:57.925
Then Baylin, the guy you said
had the answers

07:58.090 --> 08:00.512
-  to everything leaves you a warning.
- Okay.

08:01.229 --> 08:02.229
I get it.

08:03.022 --> 08:04.590
We got a bigger problem anyway.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.678
Lori's got this screwed-up idea

08:06.826 --> 08:09.348
to drive to a spot in the woods
where some hunter was killed.

08:09.468 --> 08:10.485
Why?

08:11.177 --> 08:13.360
I think she's trying to prove
she's not traumatized

08:13.539 --> 08:15.156
by what happened at the dance.

08:15.405 --> 08:17.673
So she found the scariest
thing she could get into.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.507
That sounds like a terrible idea.

08:19.857 --> 08:21.574
You haven't heard all of it.

08:21.779 --> 08:23.475
That spot in the woods?

08:23.675 --> 08:26.383
- It's right where ZZYZX used to be.
- We're not going.

08:26.595 --> 08:29.004
- Excuse me?
- Declan told me where you wanna go.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.943
I'm going.
If you guys wanna flake, fine.

08:32.235 --> 08:34.184
Whatever it is, me and Andy are in.

08:34.364 --> 08:35.679
No one invited you.

08:36.763 --> 08:39.774
- Rude.
- I meant "you" as in "him." No offense.

08:39.918 --> 08:40.936
None taken.

08:41.366 --> 08:42.448
Wait a minute.

08:42.659 --> 08:44.376
Dad's away on business.

08:44.589 --> 08:47.303
So that typically means a night
of watching old musicals with Mom.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.213
So I may have to show her my Lori file.

08:52.450 --> 08:53.934
And I have to warn you,

08:54.120 --> 08:55.392
I have photos.

08:56.862 --> 08:58.091
Welcome aboard.

09:04.897 --> 09:06.063
That's Amanda.

09:11.061 --> 09:12.342
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:18.316 --> 09:21.447
Yo. Amanda. You should get
the scoop about tonight's big event.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.759
- What big event?
- Lori Trager's excellent adventure!

09:25.011 --> 09:26.410
No one's going anywhere.

09:26.614 --> 09:28.140
Don't be such a buzzkill.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.136
She's in there.

09:35.532 --> 09:36.581
Listen...

09:37.582 --> 09:39.490
I need you to do me a favor.

09:40.143 --> 09:42.290
I want you to read Andy's mind.

09:42.836 --> 09:45.863
I don't know. Note her sweat
glands, analyze her aura.

09:46.376 --> 09:48.792
Work your extraterrestrial mojo.

09:49.111 --> 09:50.955
What are you talking about?

09:52.651 --> 09:54.168
I think I like her...

09:54.910 --> 09:57.912
in that "I wanna be alone with
her in a dark place" sort of way.

09:59.583 --> 10:00.601
Oh.

10:01.213 --> 10:04.287
And I need to know
if she feels the same way about me.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.107
Your sister said
since you have a job now,

10:07.291 --> 10:08.447
you're paying for the gas.

10:09.330 --> 10:11.687
Tell her no... and feel free
to slap her upside the head.

10:11.858 --> 10:12.960
She thought you'd say that.

10:13.150 --> 10:16.326
She said to mention how your dad might
like to know who crashed his laptop.

10:17.344 --> 10:19.241
Blackmail runs in the family.

10:19.924 --> 10:21.493
We need serious munchies.

10:21.684 --> 10:23.385
We should find someplace else to go.

10:23.550 --> 10:26.512
What would be creepier
than the scene of an actual murder?

10:26.844 --> 10:28.445
My mom's been on the warpath lately.

10:28.615 --> 10:30.561
You guys can go, but I better stay here.

10:30.868 --> 10:33.287
Come on, Amanda.
Where's your sense of adventure?

10:33.580 --> 10:35.711
Whoever killed that hunter
could still be out there.

10:35.874 --> 10:37.037
That sounds really appealing.

10:37.207 --> 10:40.276
Trager, this is lame.
We're not 12-year-olds at summer camp.

10:41.136 --> 10:42.154
Hey, Kyle.

10:42.479 --> 10:43.616
Hey, Jessi.

10:45.488 --> 10:46.505
What's up?

10:49.372 --> 10:50.745
How did you get in here?

10:51.521 --> 10:52.782
The door was open.

10:53.016 --> 10:54.097
Well, we were just leaving.

10:54.869 --> 10:57.000
- Can I come?
- You don't even know where we're going.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.297
Because we're not.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.562
Great.
I'll just stay here with you, then.

11:00.798 --> 11:02.282
New player on the field.

11:03.971 --> 11:05.201
What are we waiting for?

11:06.595 --> 11:08.717
- Amanda, I though you said...
- I changed my mind.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.513
You coming?

11:14.329 --> 11:16.301
- All right.
- And then there were seven.

11:20.467 --> 11:21.655
Come on, you guys, keep up.

11:21.819 --> 11:23.191
Whatever, bossy.

11:23.385 --> 11:24.859
This is the murder site.

11:25.112 --> 11:26.724
I looked it up online.

11:30.194 --> 11:31.636
Lori, are you okay?

11:32.235 --> 11:33.592
You keep drinking.

11:34.601 --> 11:37.282
I really appreciate the whole
"concerned brother" thing, but...

11:37.651 --> 11:40.152
let's skip the
After School Special routine.

11:43.223 --> 11:44.353
What's this?

11:57.821 --> 12:00.275
Don't worry.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

12:01.355 --> 12:02.582
Then why can I see them?

12:02.824 --> 12:04.756
You guys! Get over here! Hurry!

12:05.116 --> 12:06.176
It's Lori!

12:14.056 --> 12:15.556
I saw her go down there.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.591
Trager, quit messing around!

12:21.475 --> 12:23.311
Lori, get out! It's not safe!

12:24.141 --> 12:25.222
What's wrong?

12:26.252 --> 12:27.862
ZZYZX. That's a way in.

12:29.550 --> 12:31.537
Lori, get the hell out! Now!

12:32.430 --> 12:34.091
Cool! What is this place?

12:33.155 --> 12:34.735
RESTRICTED AREA KEAP OUT

12:36.745 --> 12:38.871
Get your candy asses down here!

12:40.475 --> 12:43.142
- I have to go get her.
- I'll go with you.

12:43.528 --> 12:44.547
Wait!

12:46.444 --> 12:48.396
- What?
- She's your sister!

12:48.570 --> 12:51.874
And following her into a porthole to
hell isn't part of my job description.

12:52.608 --> 12:54.946
However, I will contribute.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.072
Everyone stay here.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.157
We'll be back as soon as we can.

13:09.662 --> 13:10.662
Be careful.

13:36.202 --> 13:37.378
Are you okay?

13:37.939 --> 13:40.130
It's just a little... tight.

13:40.876 --> 13:42.266
I'm sort of claustrophobic.

13:42.508 --> 13:43.526
Careful.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.722
Fire doors. They work on gravity.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.084
We don't want those to come down.

13:49.465 --> 13:50.906
How did you know about that?

13:52.956 --> 13:54.404
I don't know, I just do.

13:54.578 --> 13:56.401
This isn't a game
of hide and seek, boys.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.417
This isn't a game, Trager!

13:59.483 --> 14:00.494
Did you see that?

14:10.113 --> 14:13.553
<i>I suddenly found myself
transported to the ZZYZX of the past,</i>

14:14.138 --> 14:16.161
<i>as if I were reliving a memory.</i>

14:16.413 --> 14:18.992
<i>But how could I remember this and why?</i>

14:22.537 --> 14:25.187
<i>I realized Adam
couldn't hear me or see me,</i>

14:25.745 --> 14:27.632
<i>but I could watch the memory unfold.</i>

14:28.371 --> 14:29.838
Take him out, now!

14:30.100 --> 14:31.332
<i>It was Professor Kern.</i>

14:31.544 --> 14:33.533
<i>Was this the moment he betrayed Adam?</i>

14:34.449 --> 14:35.552
Get off me!

14:36.330 --> 14:38.784
Get off me! You're making a mistake!

14:44.008 --> 14:45.280
Let me go!

14:48.099 --> 14:50.743
- You can't do this.
- It's already done. Move him out.

14:51.060 --> 14:53.207
You're not gonna get away with it, Kern.

14:54.205 --> 14:55.267
Run!

14:57.377 --> 14:59.376
Kyle! What is it!
Why'd you rush in here?

15:04.500 --> 15:06.104
I think there's something here.

15:10.846 --> 15:12.224
How'd you know that was there?

15:13.850 --> 15:15.319
I think a ghost showed it to me.

15:18.565 --> 15:21.097
It's not that hard.
Pick a character from the show.

15:22.564 --> 15:23.635
Let's see.

15:24.101 --> 15:28.172
I'm funny, likeable,
and, dare I say, philosophical.

15:29.437 --> 15:32.553
- I'll going with Shaggy.
- Wrong. You're Velma...

15:32.809 --> 15:34.620
with a Daphne overlay.

15:34.813 --> 15:37.418
Kyle's totally Fred,
minus the blond hair and the scarf.

15:38.952 --> 15:40.288
Which character are you, Jessi?

15:40.479 --> 15:41.624
I've never seen Scooby-Doo.

15:42.502 --> 15:44.691
What? The Mystery Machine?

15:45.076 --> 15:48.415
Scooby Snacks?
Subversive plot references?

15:49.857 --> 15:52.359
- Where are you going?
- To find Kyle.

15:52.528 --> 15:54.055
But he told us to stay here.

15:55.091 --> 15:56.783
Do you always do
what people tell you to?

15:56.963 --> 15:59.115
I just thought it'd be
safer if we all stayed put.

15:59.465 --> 16:00.465
Then stay put.

16:01.253 --> 16:02.270
Catfight.

16:15.256 --> 16:16.740
Alone at last.

16:17.846 --> 16:21.092
- Think you can get a fire going?
- Not a problem.

16:21.554 --> 16:22.720
What if ZZYZX is haunted?

16:22.957 --> 16:24.455
There's no such thing as haunted.

16:24.711 --> 16:27.463
People hear scratches at the window,
it's just a tree in the wind.

16:29.999 --> 16:31.334
- Foss.
- What?

16:38.920 --> 16:42.058
<i>I followed Foss and once
again stepped into the past.</i>

16:51.043 --> 16:52.571
<i>When I saw the pod,</i>

16:52.832 --> 16:56.262
<i>I realized this is the room where
I spent the first 16 years of my life.</i>

17:03.089 --> 17:04.867
<i>As I looked at myself,</i>

17:05.194 --> 17:07.494
<i>I wondered what they
were doing to me all those years.</i>

17:08.430 --> 17:10.566
<i>Did anyone care what I was feeling?</i>

17:39.007 --> 17:41.339
I don't know why
you insist on playing that.

17:41.862 --> 17:43.564
It can't comprehend it.

17:46.928 --> 17:49.196
I'm prepping for a data
input retention test.

17:49.413 --> 17:51.202
Don't let anyone through the door.

17:52.045 --> 17:54.170
Data input retention test.

17:57.246 --> 17:58.369
Do your job.

18:05.319 --> 18:06.464
You know, one of these days,

18:08.063 --> 18:10.205
he's gonna tell you what
you can do with your tests.

18:14.936 --> 18:17.244
<i>What was a data input retention test?</i>

18:18.815 --> 18:20.399
<i>And why was Foss so concerned?</i>

18:21.657 --> 18:23.047
We're losing the sun here.

18:23.511 --> 18:25.482
How's that fire coming, Prometheus?

18:25.800 --> 18:27.085
I almost got it.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.097
I thought you'd be better
at rubbing wood.

18:32.757 --> 18:33.788
I need a breather.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.588
I can't believe you brought
Sour Patch Kids but no matches.

18:41.422 --> 18:43.711
Such a wimp. It's not that cold.

18:48.095 --> 18:49.579
Where are they already?

18:50.288 --> 18:51.638
Kyle's with them. No worries.

18:51.834 --> 18:54.244
What's to worry about?
All of our friends just disappeared

18:54.434 --> 18:56.350
into a big black hole
in the middle of nowhere.

18:57.716 --> 18:58.734
- What?
- Nothing.

18:58.883 --> 19:00.431
Then stop staring at me like that.

19:02.330 --> 19:04.896
I wasn't. I was just
thinking about that...

19:05.128 --> 19:06.323
drainage pipe.

19:07.985 --> 19:09.222
Where does it lead to?

19:09.531 --> 19:11.212
A government LSD lab?

19:11.716 --> 19:14.420
A secret prison where inmates
fight to the death to be set free?

19:14.951 --> 19:16.989
You play way too much G-Force.

19:17.444 --> 19:20.197
- All right. What do you think it is?
- How about a drainage pipe?

19:21.996 --> 19:23.975
Okay. I get it.
You're scared, so you mask it

19:24.145 --> 19:26.621
- with extra-strength sarcasm.
- I'm not scared.

19:26.814 --> 19:28.882
Being afraid of
things is a big waste of time.

19:31.544 --> 19:32.562
You're staring again.

19:42.338 --> 19:45.104
This seemed like such
a good idea four beers ago.

19:46.495 --> 19:47.537
Lovely.

19:49.926 --> 19:51.426
Are you a natural blonde?

19:52.582 --> 19:53.623
Excuse me?

19:53.743 --> 19:55.447
I heard blondes have more fun.

19:57.624 --> 20:00.095
I guess it depends on the blonde. Why?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.546
Kyle likes you.

20:01.816 --> 20:03.390
I thought that was the reason.

20:04.042 --> 20:05.180
My hair color?

20:05.709 --> 20:07.319
Why else would he like you?

20:08.967 --> 20:10.393
I don't know, really.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.815
Maybe there isn't a good reason.

20:14.512 --> 20:16.430
Do you always just say
what you're thinking?

20:16.648 --> 20:17.649
I guess.

20:19.309 --> 20:21.048
Does he like that you're so...

20:21.474 --> 20:23.052
good all the time?

20:24.147 --> 20:26.142
If you're so interested in why
Kyle likes me,

20:26.277 --> 20:27.989
why don't you just ask him yourself?

20:28.109 --> 20:30.875
- All right.
- No! I mean, why do you care so much?

20:33.266 --> 20:36.156
Listen, just so you know,
Kyle is with me!

20:36.708 --> 20:38.150
It's not supposed to be that way.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.567
Well, that's how it is!

20:40.131 --> 20:42.789
Once we get to know each other,
he'll understand.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.182
Oh, I wouldn't count on it.

20:44.303 --> 20:46.649
Kyle doesn't go for the
emotionally tortured type.

20:47.155 --> 20:48.557
Kyle and I have a connection.

20:49.225 --> 20:51.746
What are you talking about?
Last week, you were all over Declan!

20:51.866 --> 20:53.684
Declan? I don't want Declan!

20:53.805 --> 20:54.805
I want Kyle.

20:57.104 --> 20:58.105
Trager!

20:58.898 --> 21:00.291
Where the hell have you guys been?

21:00.411 --> 21:01.581
Lori, get out of there!

21:04.735 --> 21:07.525
Kyle! Declan! Can you guys hear me?

21:08.632 --> 21:09.632
Oh, my God!

21:09.759 --> 21:10.784
<i>Hello?</i>

21:11.337 --> 21:12.345
Lori!

21:13.421 --> 21:14.422
Declan!

21:15.499 --> 21:16.959
<i>Kyle! Can you hear me?</i>

21:17.879 --> 21:20.536
Kyle! Declan! Can you hear me?

21:23.787 --> 21:25.754
Okay... don't panic.

21:26.369 --> 21:27.507
You have a flashlight.

21:31.543 --> 21:32.974
You have got to be kidding me.

21:34.176 --> 21:35.177
Okay.

21:35.718 --> 21:37.126
Okay, Trager, stay calm.

21:42.169 --> 21:43.952
Please don't be a crazy guy with an axe.

21:45.018 --> 21:47.621
No. No. No. No. No.

21:48.457 --> 21:49.457
Son of a...

22:02.915 --> 22:04.379
Stay here. I'll check it out.

22:04.918 --> 22:05.994
Where am I gonna go?

22:09.906 --> 22:12.287
What do you mean
"It's not giving back the information"?

22:12.461 --> 22:13.861
It depends on what we ask.

22:14.063 --> 22:15.607
Math problems are fine.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.842
We input the question,

22:17.965 --> 22:20.326
he outputs the answer
just like he's supposed to.

22:23.147 --> 22:24.352
Is that correct?

22:24.741 --> 22:27.605
Yes, that equation would take
our most advanced mathematician

22:27.725 --> 22:29.798
- two weeks to solve.
- So what's the issue?

22:30.204 --> 22:33.401
For one, it won't process any of
our strategic warfare scenarios,

22:34.045 --> 22:35.984
almost like it's making judgment calls.

22:36.757 --> 22:40.029
<i>I'd somehow rejected the information
they wanted me to process.</i>

22:40.231 --> 22:42.304
It can't make judgment calls.

22:42.476 --> 22:44.492
It's like saying
my toaster has a conscience.

22:44.612 --> 22:48.305
When your toaster malfunctions, you go
out and buy a new, but 781227 costs...

22:48.426 --> 22:49.694
I know what it costs.

22:51.180 --> 22:52.396
Yeah, it's Kern.

22:53.624 --> 22:56.404
781227 is no longer cooperating.

22:56.798 --> 22:57.806
Yeah.

23:06.452 --> 23:09.139
Too bad they don't have merit
badges for porn or video games.

23:09.259 --> 23:11.062
You'd be an Eagle Scout by now.

23:11.662 --> 23:13.349
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

23:22.489 --> 23:24.678
It's getting late.
We should go after them.

23:25.477 --> 23:26.969
I'm more worried about us.

23:27.248 --> 23:29.009
This is exactly how those movies start.

23:29.230 --> 23:31.973
They kill the impishly handsome
young comedy relief first.

23:32.210 --> 23:35.108
Only comedy going on here
is you trying to start that fire.

23:41.142 --> 23:43.269
Let's go back to the car.
It'll be warmer in there.

23:43.417 --> 23:44.536
I'm not that cold.

23:45.331 --> 23:47.105
Says the girl with two jackets on.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.195
Dead end.

24:18.117 --> 24:19.125
Perfect.

24:19.504 --> 24:23.084
<i>I could tell his fear was growing,
and I tried to keep his mind off of it.</i>

24:24.107 --> 24:25.839
I have a question about girls.

24:26.927 --> 24:28.150
Don't ask me.

24:28.377 --> 24:30.745
I just got blown off by
the weirdest one I know.

24:32.233 --> 24:35.208
I don't get it. One minute
you think she's weird, and...

24:35.344 --> 24:37.048
the other you're sorry she's gone.

24:37.641 --> 24:38.641
Yeah.

24:39.816 --> 24:41.142
I don't get it, either.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.552
<i>Declan was hiding another fear,</i>

24:43.675 --> 24:45.999
<i>just like the one I had about Foss...</i>

24:46.364 --> 24:47.467
<i>betrayal.</i>

24:48.017 --> 24:50.399
- You're worried Jessi likes me.
- No.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.262
You think she does?

24:56.791 --> 24:58.344
I don't know, but if she does,

24:58.922 --> 25:01.012
Don't worry,
I wouldn't do that to a friend.

25:06.508 --> 25:07.959
I kissed Amanda.

25:09.562 --> 25:10.676
I knew it.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.057
You had this weird morning-after vibe.

25:15.459 --> 25:16.734
I just can't figure out if...

25:16.873 --> 25:18.114
...we're a couple or not.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.819
What you need is the kiss test.

25:21.193 --> 25:23.860
This first kiss is the stuff of
romantic comedy endings.

25:23.980 --> 25:24.980
The second kiss?

25:25.100 --> 25:26.954
That's the one that defines
the relationship.

25:27.074 --> 25:28.841
- So all I have to do is just...
- Amanda?

25:29.426 --> 25:31.397
- What are you doing down here?
- Looking for you.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.078
We told you not to do that.

25:33.250 --> 25:35.574
- I know, but Jessi went down...
- Jessi's down here, too?

25:35.734 --> 25:39.442
I'm sure she's fine. She's a lot scarier
than anything else down here.

26:29.856 --> 26:30.913
Stop it!

26:34.460 --> 26:35.473
What is that?

26:36.228 --> 26:37.445
It's methane gas.

26:37.856 --> 26:40.795
Must be a natural pocket beneath us.
We have to get out of here fast.

26:50.473 --> 26:52.019
How much time do we have?

26:52.289 --> 26:54.404
Gas could have been released
all over the complex.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.839
There's no way to estimate
how much is leaking in.

26:57.038 --> 26:59.420
Great. I'm gonna die
like a canary in a coal mine.

27:00.034 --> 27:01.203
What way do we go?

27:01.472 --> 27:03.919
There's gotta be a map or something
on one of these walls.

27:04.334 --> 27:06.277
Complete with a "you are here" sticker?

27:06.586 --> 27:08.296
I'm trying to get us out of here,
Trager.

27:13.270 --> 27:15.385
Why don't you ask the ghost
to show you the way?

27:20.251 --> 27:21.478
I was kidding.

27:23.252 --> 27:24.527
<i>Declan was right.</i>

27:24.884 --> 27:28.127
<i>I didn't know how or why,
but I suddenly saw an escape.</i>

27:32.826 --> 27:36.072
Go down the hallway. Make the first left
you can. There's a door in the corridor.

27:36.293 --> 27:37.486
That's the way out.

27:37.606 --> 27:40.633
There's no fire doors between us and
that point, you shouldn't have problem.

27:40.900 --> 27:42.735
- Follow me.
- Wait, aren't you coming?

27:43.485 --> 27:45.378
- I have to find Jessi.
- I'll come with you.

27:46.645 --> 27:48.378
I need you to be safe.

27:56.363 --> 27:57.384
Come on.

28:00.043 --> 28:02.613
<i>Kern, 781227's lab.</i>

28:08.791 --> 28:10.998
- What happened?
- It's the cool memory matrix.

28:11.489 --> 28:14.194
The entire ZZYZX data bank.
All research, everything we've ever done

28:14.366 --> 28:15.522
or recorded.

28:16.205 --> 28:18.461
- It's been copied.
- Copied? Where?

28:23.088 --> 28:24.547
<i>Finally, I understood.</i>

28:24.735 --> 28:27.584
<i>I had copied all the data
from the ZZYZX mainframe,</i>

28:27.830 --> 28:31.702
<i>including every frame of surveillance
footage their cameras had ever recorded.</i>

28:31.929 --> 28:33.682
<i>I hadn't been seeing ghosts.</i>

28:33.952 --> 28:35.821
<i>I'd been seeing the past.</i>

28:36.405 --> 28:37.777
It can't do that.

28:38.563 --> 28:40.826
It can't make decisions
and act on its own.

28:41.309 --> 28:42.893
That's exactly what it's doing, sir.

28:43.213 --> 28:44.850
Well, then disconnect it now.

28:44.977 --> 28:45.979
Kern!

28:46.284 --> 28:47.691
Disengaging neuron...

28:48.191 --> 28:50.392
<i>I had spent my whole life fearing them,</i>

28:50.528 --> 28:52.396
<i>when in reality, they feared me.</i>

28:52.774 --> 28:54.118
<i>I was the ghost...</i>

28:54.376 --> 28:55.568
<i>the ghost in the machine.</i>

28:55.863 --> 28:57.507
Begin protocols for termination.

28:58.863 --> 29:00.486
I won't let you do this, Kern.

29:01.187 --> 29:02.859
<i>Kern wanted me dead.</i>

29:03.294 --> 29:04.916
<i>But I knew somehow...</i>

29:05.212 --> 29:06.908
<i>Foss had saved me.</i>

29:15.120 --> 29:16.127
So...

29:16.821 --> 29:18.900
it's a nice night out here.

29:22.737 --> 29:23.905
I'm just saying.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.217
Despite...

29:25.647 --> 29:28.549
everyone we know may be
perishing underground right now, it's...

29:29.380 --> 29:31.856
a nice night out... here.

29:35.818 --> 29:38.776
I can't take it anymore.
What is up with you?

29:39.534 --> 29:43.168
And don't say nothing, because we both
know you've been rambling all night.

29:43.558 --> 29:45.182
Even more than usual.

29:45.639 --> 29:48.465
And you've had zero tolerance
for my witty banter.

29:49.714 --> 29:52.545
If you've got something to say,
forget the jokes.

29:52.714 --> 29:54.279
Man up and say it.

29:58.621 --> 29:59.625
Okay.

30:02.070 --> 30:03.248
I have a proposal.

30:05.330 --> 30:06.849
I mean, idea.

30:08.448 --> 30:09.973
Let's count to three

30:10.353 --> 30:12.593
and both say what's on our minds
at the same time.

30:13.550 --> 30:14.879
What, are we 12?

30:16.112 --> 30:17.112
Forget it.

30:23.803 --> 30:24.809
Okay.

30:27.974 --> 30:29.151
Okay, I'm in.

30:32.366 --> 30:33.372
Here goes.

30:36.244 --> 30:37.251
One.

30:37.441 --> 30:38.735
- Two.
- Three.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.862
- I have cancer.
- I like you.

30:41.404 --> 30:42.410
What?

30:42.825 --> 30:43.831
What?

30:45.119 --> 30:46.126
Help!

30:46.420 --> 30:47.426
Help!

30:48.433 --> 30:50.066
Josh! Andy! Help!

30:58.403 --> 30:59.409
Holy...

31:50.340 --> 31:52.010
- Kyle!
- Jess!

31:55.931 --> 31:56.997
Is she breathing?

32:00.453 --> 32:02.103
I'm okay. We got to her.

32:02.226 --> 32:04.729
You're okay. You're gonna be okay.
Hang on.

32:04.968 --> 32:05.968
How did you...

32:07.412 --> 32:09.238
- Where'd he go?
- He went back in.

32:09.447 --> 32:10.454
Why?

32:13.078 --> 32:16.211
<i>I knew I couldn't survive
in this gas much longer.</i>

32:16.848 --> 32:19.639
<i>But I had to have
what was in Baylin's safe.</i>

32:21.240 --> 32:24.316
<i>As I struggled to open the lock,
I heard a voice...</i>

32:24.493 --> 32:25.790
<i>Baylin's voice.</i>

32:26.056 --> 32:27.348
<i>Find the answer.</i>

32:28.077 --> 32:29.577
<i>You already have it.</i>

32:54.396 --> 32:56.200
<i>As the gas overpowered me,</i>

32:56.742 --> 32:59.134
<i>I feared I'd never make it out alive.</i>

33:04.726 --> 33:06.910
<i>And I'd already died in ZZYZX once.</i>

33:09.853 --> 33:12.249
<i>If I fell, I knew
I wouldn't be able to get up.</i>

33:15.116 --> 33:17.173
<i>And this time I didn't have Foss
here to help me.</i>

33:20.118 --> 33:22.812
<i>So I called upon everything
he had taught me,</i>

33:23.012 --> 33:26.553
<i>and how he had sacrificed everything
so that I could live.</i>

33:28.726 --> 33:30.984
<i>Now it was my responsibility to survive.</i>

33:31.960 --> 33:32.978
Come on!

33:33.110 --> 33:34.149
Come on.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.785
<i>No matter how afraid
I might be at times,</i>

33:47.741 --> 33:49.330
<i>I could never give up.</i>

33:59.996 --> 34:01.002
Oh, God.

34:10.603 --> 34:12.129
Say something if you're okay.

34:25.812 --> 34:27.678
I'm so sorry about tonight.

34:31.523 --> 34:34.597
I guess I should have let you give me
your "After School Special" routine.

34:34.877 --> 34:35.928
That's okay.

34:36.552 --> 34:38.545
Forgiving is what concerned brothers do.

34:48.897 --> 34:50.359
I'll be right back.

34:55.987 --> 34:57.238
Some night, huh?

35:02.628 --> 35:04.282
It sucks, doesn't it...

35:05.688 --> 35:08.169
when the person who turns you on
turns you off?

35:11.646 --> 35:14.190
Did I ever tell you about
the healing power of song?

35:17.073 --> 35:18.642
I have a feeling you're about to.

35:36.524 --> 35:37.817
Feeling better?

35:40.812 --> 35:42.529
When we were down there,

35:43.192 --> 35:44.486
I saw things...

35:45.804 --> 35:49.107
strange things... happen
and I think it was because of me.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.075
I wouldn't worry about it.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.766
I think the gas was just messing
with all of our heads.

36:00.764 --> 36:02.460
I know you have to go...

36:03.758 --> 36:05.687
but I want to say something.

36:06.696 --> 36:08.286
You came back for me.

36:09.360 --> 36:12.116
When you reached out for me
and took my hand,

36:12.855 --> 36:15.506
it was the first time
I didn't feel alone.

36:18.982 --> 36:20.020
Anyway...

36:21.846 --> 36:23.627
thank you for saving my life.

36:39.082 --> 36:40.693
About what you said...

36:41.584 --> 36:42.835
Forget about it.

36:44.765 --> 36:46.779
How am I supposed to do that?

36:47.428 --> 36:48.428
Easy.

36:49.003 --> 36:51.823
When you feel the urge
to talk about it... don't.

36:53.741 --> 36:55.131
And do me a favor.

36:55.979 --> 36:57.378
Don't tell anyone.

36:59.994 --> 37:01.796
- Andy...
- I'm serious.

37:25.671 --> 37:26.688
You okay?

37:27.230 --> 37:28.248
Yeah.

37:28.676 --> 37:29.706
I guess.

37:32.175 --> 37:36.177
Everyone was really impressed with
the way you held it together tonight.

37:36.384 --> 37:39.012
Lori said you were the most
responsible one there.

37:42.100 --> 37:43.203
Responsible.

37:45.051 --> 37:47.213
I should have been more like you.

37:49.187 --> 37:53.343
I almost killed myself going back for
something I ended up not getting anyway.

37:55.800 --> 37:57.755
I could have lost everything.

37:59.153 --> 38:00.743
I could have lost you.

38:07.158 --> 38:08.854
Is this what you wanted?

38:09.466 --> 38:11.247
I had to pry it out of your hands.

38:11.395 --> 38:13.367
Seems important, so I kept it.

38:14.670 --> 38:15.921
How am I to thank you?

38:17.030 --> 38:19.108
Does this mean you're
impressed with me now, too?

38:19.306 --> 38:20.917
I'm always impressed with you.

38:27.468 --> 38:29.354
Come on, I'll walk you home.

38:49.686 --> 38:50.958
You're up late.

38:53.956 --> 38:55.228
What's all that?

38:56.553 --> 38:58.758
The... That message from Baylin.

39:01.216 --> 39:04.927
I can't figure out how, but somebody
must have tampered with it.

39:07.167 --> 39:08.503
You spent all day working on it.

39:11.009 --> 39:12.833
Well, he had no reason not to trust me.

39:17.185 --> 39:18.394
Neither do I.

39:20.741 --> 39:22.834
You've always been there for me.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.058
You're the reason I'm alive.

39:40.038 --> 39:41.437
This was Baylin's.

39:42.127 --> 39:43.484
Can't get it open.

39:46.559 --> 39:47.768
We'll figure it out.

40:11.689 --> 40:14.032
<i>Being in ZZYZX, I was able to free
myself of the ghosts</i>

40:14.254 --> 40:15.716
<i>that had haunted me.</i>

40:16.779 --> 40:20.447
<i>But I still hadn't seen the real danger
hiding in the shadows.</i>

40:20.756 --> 40:23.024
<i>If someone had tampered
with Adam's message,</i>

40:23.218 --> 40:26.186
<i>it was someone who wanted me
to lose faith in Foss.</i>

40:26.468 --> 40:30.751
<i>I had searched the information I had
acquired at ZZYZX, hoping for a clue.</i>

40:34.558 --> 40:35.915
Take him out. Now.

40:36.851 --> 40:37.869
Come on.

40:38.580 --> 40:39.969
Get your hands off me.

40:40.299 --> 40:41.350
Get off me!

40:41.542 --> 40:45.422
<i>This was the moment that Kern
betrayed Baylin all those years ago.</i>

40:47.787 --> 40:49.478
- You can't do this.
- It's already done.

40:49.665 --> 40:50.831
Move him out.

40:52.452 --> 40:54.742
<i>But I was still missing the answer.</i>

40:55.991 --> 40:58.471
<i>You're not gonna get away with it, Kern.</i>

40:59.101 --> 41:00.119
Run!

41:11.395 --> 41:13.303
That was a little dramatic,
don't you think?

41:14.723 --> 41:16.143
I had to be sure he bought it.

41:16.988 --> 41:19.065
Betrayal seems to come easy to you.

41:20.438 --> 41:21.731
It's necessary.

41:24.055 --> 41:25.870
I only wish that I could help
him understand

41:26.040 --> 41:28.012
that this thing is bigger
than all of us.

41:29.692 --> 41:32.555
You know, one of these days
we're gonna have to take care of him.

41:34.988 --> 41:36.684
I'd like to see you try.

41:43.436 --> 41:46.500
<i>I realized then that my instincts
were right about Foss.</i>

41:46.712 --> 41:49.087
<i>The man not to be trusted wasn't him.</i>

41:50.041 --> 41:51.270
It was Taylor.
