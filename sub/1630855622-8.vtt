00:16.891 --> 00:18.143
- Welcome to Lil' Piggies.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.519
What looks good
in the trough today?

00:19.561 --> 00:22.522
- Hi, let me get two
number six combo meals.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.774
One with fries. One with rings.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.027
And both with Dr. Blancos

00:27.068 --> 00:29.612
and then, uh...

00:29.654 --> 00:31.698
I just remembered
it's my birthday,

00:31.740 --> 00:34.367
so I want my free shake.

00:34.409 --> 00:37.370
Vanilla.
- Next window, please.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.664
- Bro, what goes on
in your head, dude?

00:39.706 --> 00:41.374
You're so fucking random.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.209
- Honestly, dude,
we should film this shit

00:43.251 --> 00:44.544
and put it on my Instagram.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.212
- Oh, my God.
People would lose their minds.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.672
- Shh, shh, shh.

00:49.507 --> 00:50.633
Hi there.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.594
- Oink, oink, piggies.
It's feeding time.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.263
I got two number sixes
and one free birthday shake.

00:55.305 --> 00:58.433
Can I see your ID?
- Uh, like, why?

00:58.475 --> 00:59.768
- I need to check if
it's really your birthday.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.479
- No way. Fuck you.
Just give me my free shake.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.273
- Dude, you think you're the
first person to try this shit?

01:05.315 --> 01:06.566
- The free shake promotion is

01:06.608 --> 01:08.568
only for our loyal
birthday piggies.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.362
Proof of birthday is required.

01:10.403 --> 01:11.863
If you're lying about
your birthday because of

01:11.905 --> 01:13.573
the stigma surrounding food
insecurity, please note that

01:13.615 --> 01:15.742
Lil' Piggies now accepts
food stamps and EBT payments.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.160
- Food stamps?

01:17.202 --> 01:19.871
So--so--so
you're calling me poor?

01:19.913 --> 01:21.247
Turn that shit off.
- Dude, I'm just reading

01:21.289 --> 01:22.540
the thing they tell me to read.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.125
- So you think I can't
afford a milkshake.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.418
[chuckles]
'Cause they're $3.

01:25.460 --> 01:26.753
- Then why you want a free one?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.838
- Because I'm doing a joke.
Because I'm smart.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.006
I drive a fucking Escalade

01:30.048 --> 01:31.341
in case you haven't noticed,
dipshit.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.842
- This kid has a condo.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.053
No fucking mortgage. Fuck you.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.846
- Dude, I can't even put
a free shake

01:36.888 --> 01:38.431
into my screen
unless I scan your ID.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.892
- You know what?
You have ruined enough

01:40.934 --> 01:42.936
of my birthday as it is.
Just gonna pay for my shake.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.896
You happy now?
- Nazi.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.606
- Literally.
- Fuck.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.821
Uh...hmm.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.614
This isn't strawberry.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.784
- You said vanilla.
- No, I said strawberry,

01:57.826 --> 02:00.662
and I don't want this shit,
so...

02:00.704 --> 02:06.668
* *

02:06.710 --> 02:08.169
[tires squeal]

02:10.505 --> 02:11.965
- Sixth fucking shake
I've been hit with.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.008
Worked here two fucking weeks.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.217
- Thank you so much.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.969
Could we have two
barbeque sauces please?

02:16.011 --> 02:17.554
- Of course.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.062
- Oh, this motherfucker.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.815
Calvin, I'm taking my break.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.484
- Go on and pull in here
and park around the back.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.989
[doors close]

02:36.031 --> 02:38.658
- Oh, hey, Ray-Nathan's truck.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.285
They're back.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.287
Do you want to tie me up or...

02:42.328 --> 02:43.788
- No, honey, it's fine.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.832
You ain't got to worry
about Ray-Nathan.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.000
- Oh, okay.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.293
I guess I'm just thinking about

02:48.335 --> 02:50.462
when he hid
in my backseat to kidnap me.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.214
- Don't let his size fool you

02:53.256 --> 02:56.176
or his tattoos
or his opiate problem.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.178
He's just a big, old kid.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.223
[line trilling]

03:02.265 --> 03:03.850
- Yeah?
- Yo, Donnie, what's up?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.935
It's Shayla.
- What the fuck, Shayla?

03:05.977 --> 03:07.645
You're gonna call me
after your little friend

03:07.687 --> 03:09.439
came into my garage and
beat the shit out of Paulie?

03:09.481 --> 03:11.399
He had to cancel his vacation.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.193
Disney fucked him
on his deposit.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.652
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:14.694 --> 03:18.823
Look, if you want your revenge,
here's your chance.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.326
I just need you to tell me
how to steal a Kia.

03:21.368 --> 03:24.537
- [groans]

03:24.579 --> 03:27.082
- Uh, guys,
this is a lot of blood.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.750
Wow. More and more.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.877
- What the fuck was that,
Ray-Nathan?

03:30.919 --> 03:32.921
Are you trying to kill Mom?
- I had to stop her.

03:32.962 --> 03:34.464
She's gonna get us all
sent to jail.

03:34.506 --> 03:36.383
- Nobody's going to jail.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.717
Cousin Tyler basically

03:37.759 --> 03:39.969
runs the sheriff's station,
remember?

03:40.011 --> 03:41.805
And he still owes me
from that hand job.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.973
- Cousin Tyler got fired,
Natty.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.475
- What?
- Yeah, he was stealing drugs

03:45.517 --> 03:47.227
from the evidence lockup
then the idiot

03:47.268 --> 03:48.603
did them on the way home.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.313
Crashed his cruiser
into a synagogue.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.690
- Why didn't anybody
tell me that?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.983
- Because I didn't
want her to know!

03:54.025 --> 03:55.360
And you're bad at secrets.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.570
- My therapist says I put
people at ease by sharing.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.823
- And by giving them hand jobs.
- Oh, yes, Ray-Nathan.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.451
I love easily because
I want to be loved.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.161
Doctor Amanda says
it's all connected.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.955
- I really think she needs
to go to the hospital.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.748
I can call an ambulance.
- No, I'll drive her.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.543
- No, you fucking won't.
[car alarm blares]

04:11.584 --> 04:13.294
- [laughs]
You dumbass.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.797
Set off the fucking car alarm.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.507
- I'm the dumbass.
- Yeah.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.676
- The only one in this family
thinking straight.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.928
This whole thing's been bungled
from the jump.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.432
You kidnap rich people.
Duponts and shit.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.267
These aren't successful
businessmen.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.310
They're losers like us.
Mama must've been smoking...

04:29.352 --> 04:31.062
- [mumbles]

04:31.104 --> 04:32.605
- I can't understand you.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.899
- Thought she'd get a dime
out of Craig fucking Foster.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.276
- Well, what are
we supposed to do?

04:36.317 --> 04:38.069
- Wash our hands and walk away.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.905
We kill her, torch her car,
act like it never happened.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.616
- Her DNA is
all over this club.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.785
That bird has been
picking at her hair

04:45.827 --> 04:47.537
and making nests out of it
everywhere.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.748
- Then we burn this useless
place to the ground.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
Start fresh.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.293
You know I got my five-year
plan to get us into fentanyl.

04:53.335 --> 04:54.252
That's the future.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.420
- Run.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.672
[suspenseful music]

04:57.714 --> 04:58.840
Run!

05:00.383 --> 05:02.552
Run.
- Motherfucker.

05:04.804 --> 05:07.265
- [groaning]
- Mama! Mama!

05:07.307 --> 05:12.979
* *

05:13.021 --> 05:15.273
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I found the yellow.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.233
Nothing's fucking happening.
- Shayla?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.485
Shayla!
- Oh, fuck, Donnie.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.694
I gotta go.
- Shayla!

05:19.736 --> 05:22.238
- The yellow isn't wor--
[car engine revs]

05:22.280 --> 05:25.617
Oh, hell yeah.
- Shayla! Shayla?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.869
No. Wait. Wait.
- [laughs]

05:27.911 --> 05:30.163
No.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.041
- Fuck you, Jillian.
This is what you get.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.125
Oh, shit.
- Fuck.

05:39.005 --> 05:42.717
- Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.524
This is your car, Jillian.
I'm not liable.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.692
I don't know this person.

05:58.733 --> 05:59.693
You can't prove
I was driving it.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.569
I actually, I walked here.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.530
What the fuck?

06:12.497 --> 06:13.415
- Jillian.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.458
Jillian.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.961
Jillian.
- Sir. Sir.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.587
You can't just come in here.
You gotta calm down.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.256
- My friend is here somewhere.
She called me to come get her.

06:21.297 --> 06:22.298
- What's her name?
- Craig.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.591
- Jillian.
- Over here.

06:23.633 --> 06:27.595
- Oh, thank God.
[laughs]

06:27.637 --> 06:30.515
I knew you said you were fine,
but I had to see for myself.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.101
I really thought you were dead.
- Craig, I'm okay now.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.894
You don't have to worry
anymore.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.148
Although it is nice
to hear you so upset.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.482
Do you want to talk
a little bit more

06:39.524 --> 06:40.984
about how sad you were?

06:41.026 --> 06:43.653
- Honestly, it felt like I was
missing a part of my body.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.238
- Wow.
- Just total numbness.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.364
- Oh, I love that.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.490
- I didn't know how
I was gonna go on.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.701
- A real
what's the point situation.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.870
- I'm just so sorry
I got you into this.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.913
- No, it's fine.
I knew you would come save me.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.749
That's the only thing
that got me through it.

06:55.790 --> 06:59.044
[gentle music]

06:59.085 --> 07:00.670
- [mimics buzzer]

07:00.712 --> 07:02.005
Except you didn't save her.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.840
I had to step in
and take care of business.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.176
- No, no, no, no.
You were stealing her car

07:06.217 --> 07:09.012
and you ran over a guy
on accident.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.097
You don't get to play hero.
- Yes, she does.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.308
If it wasn't for her,
I wouldn't be alive.

07:13.350 --> 07:15.101
- Yeah. What now, motherfucka?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.269
- Fine.

07:16.311 --> 07:17.729
Thank you, Shayla,
for saving my friend.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.190
I guess I misjudged you.
- And?

07:20.231 --> 07:21.524
- Can we talk about this later,
Jillian?

07:21.566 --> 07:23.318
- You promised.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.571
- And if you're interested,

07:26.613 --> 07:28.114
I'd like--
- Love.

07:28.156 --> 07:32.744
- Love to give you
your old job back.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.038
- Is that all?

07:35.080 --> 07:37.332
- I'll have the port-a-potty
cleaned every week.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.084
Even though I shouldn't be
responsible for

07:39.125 --> 07:42.504
a Tasmanian devil absolutely
leveling it with shit nonstop.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.798
- Well, I'm not coming back.
Not with that attitude.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.549
Okay, I tried.

07:46.591 --> 07:48.968
Fine.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.346
You go the normal amount.
- Thank you.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.264
That's all you had to say.
I'll take the job.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.226
- Great. I'm so thrilled.
Now, can we please leave?

07:56.267 --> 07:58.687
I don't want to be here
when Sheriff Boone shows up

07:58.728 --> 08:00.063
and lets his cousins
out of jail.

08:00.105 --> 08:01.314
- I forgot to tell you,
we don't have to

08:01.356 --> 08:03.692
worry about that anymore.
He got fired.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.485
- Wait, they didn't have
protection?

08:05.527 --> 08:08.530
So then what happens
to them now?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.573
[door buzzer blares]

08:10.615 --> 08:13.785
[soft tense music]

08:13.827 --> 08:15.578
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Jackie.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.497
How's your head?
- It's fine. Why?

08:17.539 --> 08:20.125
- Well, your son tried
to kill you with a bottle.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.543
- [scoffs]

08:21.584 --> 08:24.546
If he really wanted to kill me,
he'd'a used a brick.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.047
- Oh.

08:26.089 --> 08:29.551
- He loves Mama.
He wouldn't brick Mama.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.928
- So you're not mad at him?
- Course I'm fucking mad.

08:31.970 --> 08:35.056
But he's my son,
so I forgave him

08:35.098 --> 08:36.933
and, you know,
maybe the dipshit'll

08:36.975 --> 08:39.310
actually read
a fucking book in prison.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.354
- How long do you have
to be in for?

08:41.396 --> 08:42.772
- Ten years.

08:42.814 --> 08:46.151
Five with good behavior,
so you know,

08:46.192 --> 08:48.611
probably the ten.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.488
- Jackie, I'm so sorry.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.906
- It's okay.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.783
There's a silver lining.

08:53.825 --> 08:56.745
I got the lab results
from my colonoscopy.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.705
I got cancer.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.459
- Oh.

09:02.500 --> 09:06.004
See, in Australia,
silver lining means a good

09:06.046 --> 09:08.048
or positive thing.
- That's what this is.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.299
When you're locked up,

09:09.341 --> 09:11.968
the state has to provide
treatment for you.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.595
- I don't know much
about prisons,

09:13.636 --> 09:15.138
but amazing medical care

09:15.180 --> 09:16.890
isn't the first thing
that comes to mind.

09:16.931 --> 09:19.476
- Well, in my book,
free medical care

09:19.517 --> 09:22.145
is amazing medical care.

09:22.187 --> 09:26.066
And if I never have to speak
to that fucking Lorraine

09:26.107 --> 09:29.110
from COBRA again,
it's a happy ending.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.862
- But you had to be in prison.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.324
- It's a happy ending, Jillian.

09:34.366 --> 09:38.078
- A happy ending.
I'm so thrilled for you.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.205
- Can I ask you something?

09:40.246 --> 09:43.124
Why didn't you run away from me
when I skipped my colonoscopy

09:43.166 --> 09:44.626
when you could've?
- I don't know.

09:44.668 --> 09:46.586
Um...

09:46.628 --> 09:50.090
you're very scary to me, and

09:50.131 --> 09:53.343
it seemed like you maybe needed
someone there with you.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.762
- You're a nice kid, Jillian.
- Thank you.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.681
- Too nice.
- I'm so sorry.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.224
- The world is gonna
eat you alive

09:59.265 --> 10:02.894
if you don't stop letting
yourself get pushed around.

10:04.646 --> 10:08.650
[phone buzzing]
- [laughs]

10:08.692 --> 10:10.944
- Yo, Agent B.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.487
Been meaning
to give you a call.

10:12.529 --> 10:14.781
- What the fuck is happening
at the Lamonca group, Isaiah?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.033
The board just forced Rodney
to step down.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.953
I mean, I am watching
shit hit the fan here

10:19.994 --> 10:22.539
and now I have a mouth full
of monkey fudge.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.082
- I--I don't know
what that means.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.960
- It means that you gave
the dongle to your brother.

10:27.002 --> 10:29.045
It means that you fucked me
on this.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.964
- Yeah, I probably
should've told you,

10:31.006 --> 10:33.758
but I don't want to be
an FBI informant anymore.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.719
- You're a criminal, Isaiah.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.847
You don't get to decide
to stop being an informant,

10:38.888 --> 10:42.600
in the same way that I don't
get to decide to stop being bi.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.103
I told my father that.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.230
God, I am gonna put you in jail
so fucking hard.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.773
- Well, you gonna have to
catch me first.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.066
- You know, I'm the FBI,
dipshit.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.652
We get $10 billion a year

10:52.694 --> 10:54.654
to track down weasel fucks
like you.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.489
- Is that so?
- Sounds like you're driving.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.450
You know, what if I just put
facial recognition

10:58.491 --> 11:01.202
through every single interstate
camera in the country, huh?

11:01.244 --> 11:02.370
- You should definitely
do that.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.913
- Isaiah...
- All right.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.165
- Isaiah, don't fucking
hang up on me.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.583
- See you around, B.
- Isaiah, don't hang up.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.836
[upbeat music]

11:09.878 --> 11:16.968
* *

11:19.471 --> 11:22.807
- Done. You two are officially
once again

11:22.849 --> 11:24.726
the sole owners
of Henry's Farm.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.102
Good riddance to that shit pit.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.937
- I mean, it is
our lifelong dream.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.522
- Cool dream--and maybe one day

11:29.564 --> 11:31.900
you can win $5,000
on a scratch ticket.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.610
- I know you're being mean,

11:33.651 --> 11:36.279
but honestly,
that would be such a thrill.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.531
I have come close
so many times.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.158
[knock at door]
- Sorry to interrupt.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.243
Finished that report.
It's in your inbox

11:42.285 --> 11:44.829
if you want to check it out.
- Yeah, I know. I'll get to it.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.373
- Rodney?
- What?

11:46.414 --> 11:49.459
- You're working for Prada
even after she betrayed you?

11:49.501 --> 11:51.586
I thought you'd be angry.
- You fucking kidding me?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.004
I couldn't be more proud.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.924
To think that that little
killer came from my nuts.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.301
- Aw, it brought you two
closer together.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.011
- Oh and it's good
that she's close.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.430
Because now,
when she's not looking,

12:02.472 --> 12:04.974
I'm gonna slide a knife
in between her ribs

12:05.016 --> 12:06.393
and take back what's mine.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.395
- I'd like to see you try,
old man.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.271
- Who was that?
What was--who's talking?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.564
All I see is an empty chair

12:11.606 --> 12:13.108
because you're already
fucking dead.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.194
I'm gonna wear basketball
shorts to your funeral

12:16.236 --> 12:19.322
and dunk on your fucking grave.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.616
- Love you, Dad.
- Love you, too, kiddo.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.493
I'll see you at home.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.661
- Mm.

12:24.703 --> 12:31.626
* *

12:35.380 --> 12:37.298
- I'm so happy
to be standing here.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.217
Second chances
are a beautiful thing.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.095
- Henry's Farm 2.0
is gonna be a place

12:42.137 --> 12:44.264
where we treat each other
like family.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.350
And not like a family
that's mean to you and says,

12:47.392 --> 12:50.145
"Oh, if you're hungry,
just heat up a can of chili."

12:50.186 --> 12:51.604
But then makes chicken and rice

12:51.646 --> 12:53.523
for their dogs
right in front of you.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.650
- Talking about your family?
- Maybe.

12:55.692 --> 12:59.320
- Well, well, well.
[laughs]

12:59.362 --> 13:01.197
- God damn it.
- I hope you got room

13:01.239 --> 13:04.576
in this little family
of yours for--

13:04.617 --> 13:07.412
for one more, huh?

13:07.454 --> 13:09.873
Hello.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.167
Hola.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.877
Hermanos.
- Brock, everybody.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.462
- Yeah.

13:15.503 --> 13:20.842
My old friends,
congratulations.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.385
You've been served.

13:22.427 --> 13:24.262
- I don't understand
what's happening.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.681
- Your ass is getting sued
because Craig promised me

13:26.723 --> 13:28.558
a part of the farm
and then he never paid up.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.226
- That's not true,
is it, Craig?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.312
- No. I mean...
- It is true.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.439
I'm planning on proving it

13:34.481 --> 13:37.067
'cause I got the best fucking
lawyer there is.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.863
Meet Dean Trovia.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.782
- We actually already
know each other.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.200
- Yeah, last time
we saw this guy,

13:45.241 --> 13:47.160
he was literally
running away from us.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.079
- Because I wasn't
gonna win that case.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.081
It's like my mom always
used to tell me.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.582
No one wants to dance
with a loser.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.917
- Well, you're not gonna
win this case either.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.752
- Uh, yeah we are.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.004
If we weren't, I'd be
out of here so freaking fast.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.589
- Bet not that fast.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.841
- Want to see fast?

14:01.883 --> 14:03.343
I have evidence that proves

14:03.385 --> 14:05.303
you made a binding
verbal agreement.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.846
There were a lot of people
filming at that party.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.640
- You're bluffing.
Look at how much you sweating.

14:08.682 --> 14:11.351
- This?
This is just baseline sweat.

14:11.393 --> 14:12.769
This is where I start.
[chuckles]

14:12.811 --> 14:13.937
- That's right.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.271
- But doesn't
have to be that way.

14:15.313 --> 14:19.317
All your problems vanish
if you just sign this.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.404
[suspenseful music]

14:22.445 --> 14:25.490
Oops. Sorry.
It's hard with the casts.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.617
Oops.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.703
- God damn it, just--

14:29.744 --> 14:32.247
this contract gives me
my 5% of the farm,

14:32.288 --> 14:33.289
which you promised.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.916
- I didn't promise you
anything.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.626
- Yes, you did, you looked me
right in the eye and said it.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.086
- What are you talking about?
You can't prove it.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.129
- I'm talking
about the fact that

14:39.170 --> 14:40.505
I let you inside my socket.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.048
I see who you are,
Craig Foster.

14:42.090 --> 14:44.843
- Jillian, what are you doing?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.594
Can you guys give us a second?

14:46.636 --> 14:48.680
You signed this shit?
What the fuck, Jillian?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.348
- Fair is fair.
You promised him, right?

14:50.390 --> 14:51.766
You had a deal.
- No.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.436
I mean, I don't think so.

14:54.477 --> 14:55.645
There was a lot going on
that night.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.522
- I know Brock;
he wouldn't have helped us

14:57.564 --> 14:59.482
unless he was
getting something in return.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.901
- Okay, fine,
maybe we had an informal deal,

15:01.943 --> 15:03.319
but he was taking
advantage of me

15:03.361 --> 15:04.738
when I was worried about you.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.072
He's not a good guy.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.657
This is very basic
dog-eat-dog stuff.

15:07.699 --> 15:11.745
- But, like, dogs shouldn't
eat dogs, right?

15:11.786 --> 15:12.996
- Uh...
- No.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.832
When a dog eats another dog,
people freak out.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.625
- Ha! Got you assholes.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.627
- Shit, shit, shit.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.379
We just recorded that
whole confession.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.340
You two are even dumber
than I thought.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.885
- The party video was a bluff,
but now you're screwed.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.845
Say cheese...
[groans]

15:28.887 --> 15:31.097
- Oh.
- Shit.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.475
- [groans]

15:33.516 --> 15:35.727
- Um, I'm gonna call 911
on your phone.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.145
- [groans]

15:37.187 --> 15:39.189
- Oops, I accidentally
deleted the recording.

15:39.230 --> 15:41.024
- Craig!
- I'm calling. I'm calling.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.985
[gentle music]

15:44.027 --> 15:51.159
* *

15:57.540 --> 15:59.084
[doorbell rings]

16:04.964 --> 16:07.133
- Todd! Um...
- Isaiah.

16:07.175 --> 16:09.886
And it's been two months
like I promised.

16:09.928 --> 16:11.888
Here I am.
- Hey, babe.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.683
Everything okay?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.226
- Tall Caleb?

16:16.267 --> 16:20.480
[upbeat music]

16:20.522 --> 16:23.400
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.567
What are you doing?

16:24.609 --> 16:25.944
- Delivering the berries
we owe you.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.405
- No. No, no, no, no.
We had a contract months ago

16:28.446 --> 16:30.323
and you ghosted me.
- We're so sorry.

16:30.365 --> 16:33.243
That wasn't our choice.
Our farm got stolen from us.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.620
- But we heroically
wrestled back control

16:35.662 --> 16:37.414
and we have
one truckload of berries,

16:37.455 --> 16:39.290
which are yours
if you want them.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.753
- Normally, I'd tell you
to get lost, but

16:43.795 --> 16:46.631
the truth is, is we need
saw palmetto berries.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.717
Now more than ever.
- Why more than ever?

16:48.758 --> 16:51.553
- It's crazy, but there's
all these podcasts

16:51.594 --> 16:53.304
and videos on YouTube saying

16:53.346 --> 16:56.016
that saw palmetto prevents
prostate cancer.

16:56.057 --> 16:57.225
It's insane, right?

16:57.267 --> 16:58.601
- Whoa, that's--yeah.
- That's crazy.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.103
- That's crazy.
- It is amazing

17:00.145 --> 17:03.356
that people can be that stupid,
but their money's good,

17:03.398 --> 17:05.400
so I need all the berries
I can get.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.110
- Sounds like this is
gonna be the start of

17:07.152 --> 17:09.988
a long and fruitful...
- [screams]

17:10.030 --> 17:12.282
Oh, my God! Don't touch it!

17:12.323 --> 17:14.576
- What's going on?
- Holy shit, it's huge.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.286
- What the fuck?
- What is that?

17:16.327 --> 17:19.330
[suspenseful music]

17:19.372 --> 17:23.084
* *

17:23.126 --> 17:24.461
Oh, shit.

17:29.341 --> 17:32.719
[suspenseful music]

17:32.761 --> 17:34.971
- What the heck is that?
- I think it's just a beetle.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.514
A harmless beetle.
Probably one of yours.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.641
- It's a giant African
land snail.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.268
- Is it dangerous?
- No.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.936
- Yes.
They can carry meningitis.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.646
- Sometimes.
- Which infects humans.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.190
- Occasionally.
- And it kills

17:45.231 --> 17:46.524
one in ten people who get it.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.943
- They usually have
other co-morbidities.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.820
- Craig, we have to
burn the berries now.

17:50.862 --> 17:52.322
- This is our last harvest
of the season.

17:52.364 --> 17:54.157
If we burn these, there are
no more berries for a year.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.700
We'll lose the farm.
We'll lose everything.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.495
- Okay, but we can't pretend
there aren't snails there.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.997
- [sighs]
I know. You're right.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.458
But there's only snails
on the one crate.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.293
We'll just toss these.
The rest are fine.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.711
- Oh, holy shit! Another one!

18:06.753 --> 18:07.962
- [yelps]
[tool clatters]

18:08.004 --> 18:09.631
- Another one of what?
We don't know what

18:09.673 --> 18:10.799
they're talking about.
They not talking to us.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.259
- Are you talking about snails?
- Yeah.

18:13.301 --> 18:16.554
- Let's everyone just cool
our jets before we go and do

18:16.596 --> 18:19.432
something rash like
burning any berries.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.309
Just give me half an hour,
okay?

18:21.351 --> 18:22.852
Let Walt work.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.399
- Who's Walt?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.567
- He's Walt.
He said let himself work.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.985
Third person.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.577
- Okay. I have got good news.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.496
both: You do?

18:41.538 --> 18:43.415
- So I pinged my manager
on this,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.417
we ran it up the flagpole
to Corporate,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.128
who took Legal's temperature,
and...

18:48.169 --> 18:50.755
we'd love to buy your berries.
- Yes!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.841
- Because you figured out a way
to sterilize them

18:52.882 --> 18:54.884
so people won't get sick?
- Oh, no.

18:54.926 --> 18:57.178
That is a really
good idea, though.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.556
Let me make a note of that.

18:59.597 --> 19:02.017
I don't have a pen.
Anyway, where were we?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.144
You're gonna take
the berries like this

19:04.185 --> 19:05.645
with the snail gunk on them.

19:05.687 --> 19:07.439
- Look, our company is about
to be bought out

19:07.480 --> 19:09.232
by a multi-national
corporation.

19:09.274 --> 19:10.734
I can't tell you which one, but

19:10.775 --> 19:12.152
let's just say
they make bleach.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.904
- So Clorox.

19:14.946 --> 19:17.574
- 32 different companies
make bleach, so...

19:17.615 --> 19:19.200
any of the famous ones.

19:19.242 --> 19:21.953
But the deal is in jeopardy
because we came up short

19:21.995 --> 19:25.040
in our Q3 earnings, so we can't
afford to halt saw palmetto

19:25.081 --> 19:26.791
production during this
gold rush of the market.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.252
- But people could get sick.
- Yeah, yes.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.963
And I flagged that concern
for my manager,

19:32.005 --> 19:35.216
who circled back to Corporate,
who picked Legal's brain

19:35.258 --> 19:36.593
because trust me, nobody wants

19:36.634 --> 19:38.261
to boil the ocean
on this thing.

19:38.303 --> 19:41.014
But everybody is confident that
this passes the smell test

19:41.056 --> 19:42.766
vis-à-vis our regulatory
exposure.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.100
- You could get sued.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.894
- Yeah, but we'll have already
been sold by then,

19:45.935 --> 19:47.437
and all our board members
will have

19:47.479 --> 19:48.730
cashed out their stock options.

19:48.772 --> 19:50.940
- You on the board?
- Oh, I wish.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.109
No, I bag my lunch and clock in

19:53.151 --> 19:55.111
a 14-hour work day
like any regular Joe.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.988
- So why do you care
if the board gets rich?

19:57.030 --> 20:00.658
- That is a really good
question.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.953
Because if I were the boss

20:03.995 --> 20:06.456
and my employees didn't
wake up every day

20:06.498 --> 20:08.833
trying to make me
the most money possible,

20:08.875 --> 20:11.294
I'd fire their ass
on Christmas morning.

20:11.336 --> 20:15.674
I don't care how many people
die to snails or whatever.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.884
Again, that's just
if I were the boss.

20:17.926 --> 20:19.135
[chuckles]

20:19.177 --> 20:22.931
- Well, we're not gonna do it.
Right, Craig?

20:22.972 --> 20:25.183
- Yeah.

20:25.225 --> 20:26.685
I don't think we can.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.895
- Look, this deal
cannot fall through.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.690
So Green Bounty Organics is
prepared to bring you both on

20:31.731 --> 20:34.401
as senior consultants
with a hiring bonus

20:34.442 --> 20:36.069
paid out in stock options.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.030
- What? Really?
- Yeah. You'll have equity.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.408
It's something I worked
my entire career for.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.034
[sighs]
But don't worry.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.870
I'll get there.
I just gotta keep grinding.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.664
Soon it's gonna be Walt's turn.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.375
- And when the company
gets sold,

20:50.417 --> 20:52.544
we'd be...
- Rich.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.046
Really fucking rich.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.051
- Can you give us a second?

21:01.720 --> 21:04.347
- I don't understand.
Are you and Caleb...

21:04.389 --> 21:07.183
- Caleb has been really sweet
to me in this difficult time.

21:07.225 --> 21:09.060
- I thought we agreed that
you'd give me two months, babe.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.022
- I shouldn't have said that.
What you did

21:12.063 --> 21:13.940
was fucked up, Todd.
- Isaiah.

21:13.982 --> 21:14.858
- You told me your name
was Todd.

21:14.899 --> 21:16.026
I'ma call you Todd.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.736
Do you have any idea
how much therapy

21:17.777 --> 21:19.696
I've been through
since you left?

21:19.738 --> 21:21.573
- Probably a lot.
I talked to Kristen.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.741
- She thinks
you're a sociopath.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.827
- I'm not. I'm a good guy now.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.162
I went undercover,

21:27.203 --> 21:28.705
then I had to work
for Rodney Lamonca,

21:28.747 --> 21:31.833
who is a killer, but his
daughter, she's way worse.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.376
She definitely gonna
kill people later in her life.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.378
And then, you know,
obviously, working for the FBI,

21:35.420 --> 21:37.797
and he's bisexual, and then
I had to sacrifice myself

21:37.839 --> 21:39.632
to save my brother,
and then somebody got their ass

21:39.674 --> 21:41.384
eaten by a shark.
- Come on, Todd.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.011
That's more made up
than the doctor story.

21:43.053 --> 21:44.262
- I'm telling you the truth.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.222
- Well, I'm sorry,
I guess I just assume

21:46.264 --> 21:47.974
everybody's lying to me
since I found out

21:48.016 --> 21:49.309
my boyfriend
was a fucking conman.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.854
- But everything
I've been doing,

21:52.896 --> 21:55.565
that was all just
to win you back.

21:55.607 --> 21:58.068
So all this was for nothing.

21:58.109 --> 21:59.652
- Yeah.
- Caleb, if you don't

21:59.694 --> 22:00.820
shut the fuck up...

22:00.862 --> 22:01.780
- You said
you saved your brother,

22:01.821 --> 22:03.990
and he's the honest one, right?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.159
Maybe he'll do something good
with the chance you gave him.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.623
- He fucking better.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.586
- You don't actually
wanna take this deal, do you?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.713
- Do you realize
what he's offering us?

22:18.755 --> 22:20.965
This isn't a good job
or enough money

22:21.007 --> 22:22.509
to keep the farm afloat
another year.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.928
He's handing us
a golden ticket.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.388
It's at least worth
a conversation.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.264
- But people could die.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.642
- I know they could,
but they probably won't.

22:30.684 --> 22:32.644
They almost definitely won't.

22:32.686 --> 22:35.772
Look, who makes your phone?

22:35.814 --> 22:37.357
- A company called Jamokia.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.192
- Okay, you think Jamokia is

22:39.234 --> 22:41.403
treating the workers
in their factory well?

22:41.444 --> 22:43.947
You think everyone who built
your Kia is doing great?

22:43.988 --> 22:45.740
- Don't you dare bring Kia
into this.

22:45.782 --> 22:47.450
- They already in it, Jillian.

22:47.492 --> 22:50.453
We all cause so much suffering
just by existing in this world.

22:50.495 --> 22:52.747
The only thing you can do
is try not to think about it.

22:52.789 --> 22:53.998
- Well, I can't do that.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.084
- You repress bad thoughts
all the time.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.836
Probably more than anyone
I've ever met.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.921
- That's not true.
- Oh, okay.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.256
How you feel about
your recent kidnapping?

23:01.297 --> 23:03.383
- Totally fine.
It was a good experience.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.093
Jackie's one of
my best friends now.

23:05.135 --> 23:06.469
Sort of a surrogate mother.

23:06.511 --> 23:07.804
- See?

23:07.846 --> 23:10.098
I'm just trying to be
more like you.

23:10.140 --> 23:12.308
Let's bottle up the darkness
and keep on moving forward.

23:12.350 --> 23:15.979
- But you're not being like me
because I wouldn't hurt anyone.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.106
I feel like I don't even
know you anymore.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.816
You've changed.
- No, I haven't.

23:19.858 --> 23:22.527
All I've ever cared about
from the moment we met

23:22.569 --> 23:24.154
was taking care of people.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.197
Not the strangers
that make our cars,

23:26.239 --> 23:29.117
but my people.
The people I love.

23:29.159 --> 23:32.245
That means Nessa and Camille

23:32.287 --> 23:34.914
and Isaiah and you.

23:34.956 --> 23:36.916
Yeah, I guess that's
the one way I have changed.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.836
You're part of that group now.
You my people.

23:39.878 --> 23:41.546
- Thank you for saying that.

23:41.588 --> 23:42.839
Means so much to me,

23:42.881 --> 23:44.382
and I'll show
my appreciation later

23:44.424 --> 23:46.509
during a conversation
that isn't about murder.

23:46.551 --> 23:50.180
- Selling these berries could
change your life, Jillian.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.848
- I'm saying no.

23:51.890 --> 23:52.974
And we're partners,
so you can't

23:53.016 --> 23:54.851
make this decision without me.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.895
I'm not gonna be pushed around.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.398
- Okay.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.691
- Okay?

24:01.733 --> 24:05.820
- I mean, I think
it's very dumb, but...

24:05.862 --> 24:08.448
it's also very nice.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.950
That's what makes you Jillian.

24:10.992 --> 24:12.911
- I'm not dumb, Craig.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.121
- I know you're not.
I was just...

24:15.163 --> 24:17.582
[sighs]
Forget about it.

24:17.624 --> 24:21.169
Let's go back to the farm.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.671
Tell everyone the bad news.

24:22.712 --> 24:29.386
* *

24:32.639 --> 24:35.850
- Mm. That is a wow margarita.

24:35.892 --> 24:37.852
Why aren't you guys drinking?

24:37.894 --> 24:39.979
- It's 11 in the morning.

24:40.021 --> 24:42.857
We got a lot of work to do.
What's going on?

24:45.819 --> 24:47.987
- Well, seeing as
we won't get paid

24:48.029 --> 24:49.322
for that last shipment
of berries,

24:49.364 --> 24:51.658
we have to default
on our loans.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.453
We're gonna declare bankruptcy
and close the farm.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.663
- Motherfucker.

24:56.705 --> 24:59.040
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.252
Come here.
[sighs]

25:02.293 --> 25:03.795
I mean, the writing
was on the wall.

25:03.837 --> 25:06.089
You two are fucking jinxes.

25:06.131 --> 25:10.844
- Okay, well, I gotta get
these berries to the burn pit.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.680
I'm sorry we couldn't
make this work.

25:13.722 --> 25:15.181
We really tried.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.314
Hey, we need to meet up.

25:23.356 --> 25:26.317
[thunder rumbles]

25:26.359 --> 25:33.324
* *

25:43.376 --> 25:46.755
- I shouldn't be talking to you
without my lawyer.

25:46.796 --> 25:49.382
You know your fucked up trailer
shattered both his ankles.

25:49.424 --> 25:53.636
Doctor said his feet are like
two socks filled with granola.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.013
- Brought the contract.

25:57.724 --> 26:01.144
- I don't understand.
- Jillian's already signed it.

26:01.186 --> 26:04.147
So if I sign it, too,
it's done.

26:04.189 --> 26:06.149
You're part owner of the farm.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.484
- Why would you do that?

26:07.525 --> 26:09.861
- Because your 5% would come
half from me,

26:09.903 --> 26:16.326
half from Jillian, so together
you and me would own 52.5%

26:16.368 --> 26:18.078
We have controlling interest.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.330
- Yeah, no, I know what
controlling interest is,

26:20.372 --> 26:21.664
Craig, okay?

26:21.706 --> 26:24.751
I read Corby's sport
management textbooks.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.670
I skim them.
I get the headlines.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.588
It's all stuff I already knew.
What's the catch?

26:28.630 --> 26:31.508
- I just need a guarantee

26:31.549 --> 26:34.511
that you'll back me
on certain...

26:34.552 --> 26:36.054
big picture decisions.

26:36.096 --> 26:38.098
- What kind of big picture
decisions?

26:38.139 --> 26:45.188
* *

26:45.230 --> 26:47.357
- Here's a contract for you

26:47.399 --> 26:51.361
and a contract for you.
- Fuck yeah.

26:51.403 --> 26:53.446
- Congratulations.
You are now executives

26:53.488 --> 26:56.032
at Green Bounty Organics.
- All right.

26:56.074 --> 26:58.159
Here we go.
- Thank God you came through.

26:58.201 --> 27:01.037
We need to get these berries
on shelves right away.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.914
Oh, and when are
your birthdays?

27:02.956 --> 27:05.208
I like to send
all my bosses gifts.

27:05.250 --> 27:07.460
- December 25. Christmas day.

27:12.716 --> 27:15.427
- New developments today
in the mysterious uptake

27:15.468 --> 27:17.929
of meningitis sweeping
American hospitals.

27:17.971 --> 27:20.807
Health officials are on
high alert as the outbreak

27:20.849 --> 27:23.309
has spread across
five different states.

27:23.351 --> 27:26.229
Georgia, Mississippi...
- Get the fuck out of the way.

27:26.271 --> 27:28.648
- And Florida have
all seen cases.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.568
The CDC is now warning that
the disease may be linked

27:31.609 --> 27:33.528
to over the counter
health supplements

27:33.570 --> 27:35.947
containing
saw palmetto berry extract.

27:35.989 --> 27:38.992
- Thank God I sold
that fucking farm.

27:39.034 --> 27:41.286
- Health officials believe
the berries were infected

27:41.327 --> 27:44.706
by giant African land snails,
or GAL,

27:44.748 --> 27:47.417
a rare but highly
destructive species

27:47.459 --> 27:49.544
of invasive snail that can
become infected

27:49.586 --> 27:52.839
with a parasite known
as rat lungworm.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.883
- Oink, oink. Order number 34.

27:54.924 --> 27:57.427
- The snails can cause
eosinophilic meningitis

27:57.469 --> 27:59.262
in humans, which can lead

27:59.304 --> 28:01.598
to nausea, vomiting,
and headaches.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.683
Other symptoms include...
- Are you my Uber?

28:03.725 --> 28:07.771
- Yup. I'm Jillian G. Where to?
- Check the fucking app.

28:07.812 --> 28:09.439
- Right. Okay, sorry.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.900
- So far there have been
32 recorded cases

28:11.941 --> 28:15.278
of meningitis linked to
tainted saw palmetto extract.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.989
- Jesus Christ.
- I know.

28:18.031 --> 28:20.283
The news is such a bummer.

28:20.325 --> 28:21.993
But that's what's great
about the Maldives.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.621
You leave the real world
behind.

28:24.662 --> 28:26.414
How long are you staying?

28:26.456 --> 28:29.084
- I don't know yet.
One-way ticket.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.044
- Ooh, love that.

28:31.086 --> 28:33.380
"Eat, Pray, Love."
[chuckles]

28:35.632 --> 28:37.634
- Of those 32 cases,
there have been

28:37.676 --> 28:40.303
seven hospitalizations
and two--

28:40.345 --> 28:42.138
- Nope. Turning this shit off.

28:42.180 --> 28:43.973
- Dad.
- We're not watching that.

28:44.015 --> 28:45.600
No more TV.

28:45.642 --> 28:46.685
- What am I supposed
to do then?

28:46.726 --> 28:48.645
- It's a new apartment.
Go explore.

28:48.687 --> 28:51.356
Go, your rooms are down
the hall to the left.

28:51.398 --> 28:53.733
- Did you say rooms?
- Yeah. You have two rooms.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.695
My girl gets a suite.
- [vocalizing]

28:56.736 --> 28:58.738
[Pitbull's "Timber"]

28:58.780 --> 29:02.033
- Of course, I will always
have room for you

29:02.075 --> 29:04.369
and that weird white baby.

29:04.411 --> 29:06.996
Now, come on.
You need to see the view.

29:07.038 --> 29:08.415
- * It's going down *

29:08.456 --> 29:10.333

29:18.258 --> 29:20.093
- * Look up in the skies,
it's a bird, it's a plane *

29:20.135 --> 29:21.928
* Nah, it's just me
ain't a damn thing changed *

29:21.970 --> 29:23.805
* Live in hotels,
swing on planes *

29:23.847 --> 29:25.598
* Blessed to say
money ain't a thing *

29:25.640 --> 29:27.559
* Come jumping like LeBron,
now Voli *

29:27.600 --> 29:29.352
* Order me another round,

29:29.394 --> 29:31.229
* We about to climb, why? *

29:31.271 --> 29:32.939
* 'Cause it's about
to go down *

29:32.981 --> 29:34.858
* Swing your partner
'round and 'round *

29:34.899 --> 29:36.651
* End of the night,
it's going down *

29:36.693 --> 29:38.695
* One more shot,
another round *

29:38.737 --> 29:40.488
* End of the night,
it's going down *

29:40.530 --> 29:42.323
* Swing your partner
'round and 'round *

29:42.365 --> 29:44.159
* End of the night,
it's going down *

29:44.200 --> 29:45.869
* One more shot,
another round *

29:45.910 --> 29:47.412
* End of the night,
it's going down *

29:47.454 --> 29:48.997
- * It's going down *

29:49.039 --> 29:50.832
* I'm yelling timber *

29:50.874 --> 29:52.542
* You better move *

29:52.584 --> 29:54.461
* You better dance *

29:54.502 --> 29:56.254

29:56.296 --> 29:58.298

30:00.091 --> 30:01.885

30:01.926 --> 30:04.054

30:14.981 --> 30:17.192

30:17.233 --> 30:19.361
* Whoa, oh, oh *

30:19.402 --> 30:21.363

30:21.404 --> 30:24.366

- Not a doctor. Shh.
