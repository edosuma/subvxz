HE WAS, LIKE, BAM, BAM.

23:27.344 --> 23:29.103
LIKE, THEY WOULD DO THE SAME
THING.

23:29.137 --> 23:31.310
>> THAT'S WHAT I DID THE FIRST
TIME I WAS H.O.H.

23:31.344 --> 23:32.620
I JUST PICKED THE WRONG PEOPLE.

23:32.655 --> 23:33.827
>> LOOK AT ME.

23:33.862 --> 23:37.068
THEY TOLD US ALL TO PICK TOM,
PICK TOM, PICK TOM.

23:37.103 --> 23:39.827
I MEAN, KEEP PICKING YOU TO GO.

23:39.862 --> 23:40.758
I WOULDN'T HAVE.

23:40.793 --> 23:42.655
SHE DIDN'T.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.931
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.172
>> LOOK AT ME.

23:45.206 --> 23:49.931
IF I WON, AND SHE WON, WE WERE
GOING TO PUT NATALIE AND LOLO.

23:49.965 --> 23:56.724
LIKE, BAM, LIKE... NO-- SORRY.

23:56.758 --> 23:58.482
THEY'VE BEEN MEAN GIRLS SINCE
DAY ONE.

23:58.517 --> 24:02.172
>> YOU KNOW ABOUT MEAN GIRLS,
RIGHT?

24:02.206 --> 24:03.896
>> YEAH.

24:03.931 --> 24:08.034
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHERE
I'M SEEING DINA ACTUALLY REALLY

24:08.068 --> 24:09.034
TALK GAME.

24:09.068 --> 24:13.793
OH, THERE'S DINA, THE
STRATEGIST.

24:13.827 --> 24:15.724
DINA WANTS TO TALK ABOUT
KNOCKING OUT SOME PEOPLE FROM

24:15.758 --> 24:17.103
THE OTHER SIDE.

24:17.137 --> 24:18.034
YES, LET'S DO IT.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.103
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO DO
ANYWAY.

24:19.137 --> 24:20.413
I'M HAPPY TO DO IT WITH YOU.

24:20.448 --> 24:21.689
I NEED YOUR VOTE.

24:21.724 --> 24:24.793
I NEED KANDI'S VOTE.

24:24.827 --> 24:26.620
LET'S DO THIS.

24:26.655 --> 24:28.931
>> MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T HANG HERE
TOO MUCH.

24:28.965 --> 24:29.724
>> YEAH, BYE.

24:29.758 --> 24:36.482
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

24:36.517 --> 24:39.103
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:39.137 --> 24:45.448
>> IT'S IN GOD'S HANDS.

24:45.482 --> 24:51.310
>> THEY HAVE NO BLOOD ON THEIR
HANDS.

24:51.344 --> 24:57.793
>> DID YOU GUYS TELL KANDI TO
PICK ME?

24:57.827 --> 25:01.275
>> NO, SHE JUST DID IT.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.206
TOLD YOU.

25:02.241 --> 25:05.137
YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND TELL THE
ROOM THAT.

25:05.172 --> 25:09.068
>> KANDI CHOOSING ME IN THE
COMPETITION OVER TOM DEFINITELY

25:09.103 --> 25:12.034
MAKES ME QUESTION WHERE HER
LOYALTY LIES.

25:12.068 --> 25:14.275
LINES HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN DRAWN
IN THE SAND, SO IF YOU'RE NOT

25:14.310 --> 25:15.931
WITH US, YOU ARE AGAINST US.

25:15.965 --> 25:19.275
AND KANDI, CLEARLY, IS AGAINST
US.

25:19.310 --> 25:25.034
BY THE WAY, YOU'RE GOING TO
LIKE-- SHE'S WITH HIM.

25:25.068 --> 25:26.379
>> SHE'S NOT WITH HIM.

25:26.413 --> 25:29.068
>> YES, SHE IS.

25:29.103 --> 25:30.931
IT WAS A PERFECT TEST.

25:30.965 --> 25:32.758
AND SHE FAILED.

25:32.793 --> 25:34.172
>> SHE SAID THAT SHE...

25:34.206 --> 25:35.931
>> WHAT.

25:35.965 --> 25:39.655
>> SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T BEAT
TOM.

25:39.689 --> 25:40.517
>> TAKE A SEAT.

25:40.551 --> 25:48.793
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT.

25:50.172 --> 25:52.068
>> COMPLETELY.

25:52.103 --> 26:00.482
>> BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE WOULD
BE GOOD AT THE STRATEGY STUFF.

26:00.517 --> 26:04.103
>> SHE GETS NO BLOOD ON HER
HANDS.

26:04.137 --> 26:08.724
AND BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T PICK
TOM--

26:08.758 --> 26:13.482
>> I'M JUST REALLY TRYING TO
PROTECT KANDI, BECAUSE SHE

26:13.517 --> 26:18.137
SELFISHLY LET THE CAT OUT OF THE
BAG, AND LET IT BE KNOWN THAT

26:18.172 --> 26:19.517
SHE'S CLEARLY WORKING WITH TOM.

26:19.551 --> 26:23.137
AND I HAVE TO PROTECT HER
BECAUSE WE ARE KIND OF, LIKE, A

26:23.172 --> 26:24.068
GOOD TEAM.

26:24.103 --> 26:27.310
>> SHE DREW THE LINE IN THE SAND
FOR SURE.

26:27.344 --> 26:29.206
SO SHE'S DEAD TO ME.

26:29.241 --> 26:31.206
COMPLETELY.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.793
♪ ♪
>> I'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED ONCE.

26:45.827 --> 26:48.000
I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS GUY.

26:48.034 --> 26:50.517
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO HIM FOR
FIVE YEARS, LIKE, EVERY DAY, A

26:50.551 --> 26:51.448
LOT.

26:51.482 --> 26:53.724
I FEEL LIKE I KNOW HIM.

26:53.758 --> 26:55.896
YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK TO
SOMEONE ON THE PHONE, YOU FEEL

26:55.931 --> 26:57.000
LIKE YOU KNOW THEM.

26:57.034 --> 26:58.241
I MISS A SPECIAL SOMEONE.

26:58.275 --> 27:00.000
I'M IN NEW YORK.

27:00.034 --> 27:02.620
HE'S IN ANOTHER STATE.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.206
IT'S JUST-- IT'S PERSONAL.

27:04.241 --> 27:06.000
>> HAVE YOU ALL MET?

27:06.034 --> 27:09.310
>> OH, WE WILL.

27:09.344 --> 27:11.655
I, YOU'RE GETTING-- IT'S NOT
LIKE THAT.

27:11.689 --> 27:13.275
I SWEAR TO YOU HE'S REAL.

27:13.310 --> 27:14.379
I SWEAR.

27:14.413 --> 27:16.448
IT'S-- IT'S CRAZY.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.379
BUT I'M GOING TO MARRY HIM.

27:18.413 --> 27:20.827
I REALLY-- IT'S REALLY TRUE.

27:20.862 --> 27:22.000
>> OH, SORRY.

27:22.034 --> 27:22.758
YOU TWEETING?

27:22.793 --> 27:29.724
>> I'M FINISHED.

27:29.758 --> 27:39.034
>> I SWEAR HE'S NOT.

27:39.068 --> 27:41.172
>> LIES, IT'S 2019.

27:41.206 --> 27:42.689
>> LIES.

27:42.724 --> 27:43.620
THAT'S A LIE.

27:43.655 --> 27:45.103
>> LAUGH IN THE PIT OF THE
DEVIL'S STOMACH.

27:45.137 --> 27:46.034
DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT.

27:46.068 --> 27:49.103
HOW ABOUT THIS MOMMA GUY IS A
CATFISH.

27:49.137 --> 27:51.896
THAT'S HER BOYFRIEND!

27:51.931 --> 27:53.344
EVERYBODY FACETIMES.

27:53.379 --> 27:57.448
MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD FACETIMES ME TO
FIND OUT WHERE I'M AT.

27:57.482 --> 27:59.379
SO WHAT IS GOING ON?

27:59.413 --> 28:02.241
WHY EVAPORATE YOU MET IN FIVE
YEARS?

28:02.275 --> 28:06.758
>> BECAUSE I HAVEN'T GOT THERE--
>> WHERE IS HE?

28:06.793 --> 28:08.758
>> SAN FRANCISCO.

28:08.793 --> 28:11.931
>> GIRL, STOP!

28:11.965 --> 28:13.206
>> NO, FROM HERE.

28:13.241 --> 28:14.241
I'M HERE!

28:14.275 --> 28:17.689
I'LL MEET HIM.

28:17.724 --> 28:19.344
>> BOOOOO!

28:19.379 --> 28:20.965
>> BOOOO!

28:21.000 --> 28:22.586
>> NO, WAIT, WAIT.

28:22.620 --> 28:23.448
HE CAN'T LEAVE.

28:23.482 --> 28:26.034
>> BOOO-OOOO!

28:26.068 --> 28:27.172
>> CATFISH.

28:27.206 --> 28:31.896
>> HE CAN'T LEAVE BECAUSE HE'S
TAKING CARE OF HIS MOM.

28:31.931 --> 28:32.896
>> GET OUT OF HERE.

28:32.931 --> 28:35.344
>> HE CAN'T COME PICK YOU UP
FROM THE AIRPORT?

28:35.379 --> 28:37.965
>> I COULD EASILY GO THERE, AND
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.206
>> YOU CANNOT GO BY YOURSELF.

28:40.241 --> 28:41.241
GO FYOU GO.

28:41.275 --> 28:42.413
NO.

28:42.448 --> 28:43.620
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE ONE OF YOUR
HOME GIRLS FLY WITH YOU.

28:43.655 --> 28:44.586
>> YOU'RE IN L.A.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.379
COME WITH ME.

28:45.413 --> 28:47.034
>> I'LL COME WITH YOU.

28:47.068 --> 28:49.517
HE WON'T WANT TO MEET ME.

28:49.551 --> 28:51.551
"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN IN FIVE
YEARS?"

28:51.586 --> 28:55.103
MAN, I WANT TO GO BECAUSE I WANT
TO SEE.

28:55.137 --> 28:59.724
IS THIS A CATFISH SITUATION, THE
ADDRESS, AND NUMBER AND VOICE TO

28:59.758 --> 29:00.551
THE PHONE.

29:00.586 --> 29:01.655
BETTER ALL ADD UP.

29:01.689 --> 29:03.551
CATFISH!

29:03.586 --> 29:05.068
>> IT'S REAL.

29:05.103 --> 29:14.241
SOME GUYS DON'T JUSTIZE
IPHONES.

29:14.275 --> 29:16.172
>> YOU KNOW THAT LOLO WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU?

29:16.206 --> 29:17.517
>> YEAH.

29:17.551 --> 29:19.241
OKAY, WELL I COULD TALK TO HER
FIRST.

29:19.275 --> 29:21.241
I WANT TO DO ONE-ON-ONE
MEETINGS, THOUGH.

29:21.275 --> 29:23.689
I'M MEETING WITH ALL THE
HOUSEGUESTS, JUST GETTING

29:23.724 --> 29:26.551
TOGETHER WITH EVERYONE AND
TALKING MIGHT CURRY SOME SORT OF

29:26.586 --> 29:30.034
FAVOR WITH THEM NEXT WEEK WHEN
I'M NOT H.O.H.

29:30.068 --> 29:33.000
I'M GOING TO TELL THEM ALL
THEY'RE NOT THE TARGET, BUT,

29:33.034 --> 29:34.241
OBVIOUSLY, ONE OF THEM IS.

29:34.275 --> 29:37.551
I JUST WANT TO NEGOTIATE FOR
SOME SORT OF PROTECTION FOR NEXT

29:37.586 --> 29:38.793
WEEK.

29:38.827 --> 29:41.241
AND I THINK YOU'RE DUE TO BE
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD SOONER RATHER

29:41.275 --> 29:41.862
THAN LATER.

29:41.896 --> 29:43.068
>> YEAH.

29:43.103 --> 29:47.413
>> IF I DON'T PUT OUT BLOCK, YOU
DON'T PUT ME ON THE BLOCK.

29:47.448 --> 29:48.931
>> I'M GOOD WITH THAT.

29:48.965 --> 29:54.000
>> SO HERE'S ANOTHER SCENARIO SO
YOU'RE NOT BLINDSIDED.

29:54.034 --> 29:57.206
I'M NOT GOING TO PUT OUT BLOCK,
BUT IF SOMEBODY ON THE BLOCK

29:57.241 --> 30:01.482
WINS VETO, I MIGHT HAVE TO PUT
YOU ON THE BLOCK.

30:01.517 --> 30:08.379
BUT I WILL BE CONTINGENTING THE-
TARGETING THE OTHER PERSON, NOT

30:08.413 --> 30:08.931
YOU.

30:08.965 --> 30:09.586
>> THAT'S A BACKDOOR.

30:09.620 --> 30:10.827
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

30:10.862 --> 30:14.275
HOWEVER, I AM TRYING TO REMAIN
CALM BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO HEAR

30:14.310 --> 30:15.517
HIM OUT.

30:15.551 --> 30:19.000
BUT ALL IN ALL, I KNOW THAT
MYSELF, LOLO, AND RICKY ARE NOT

30:19.034 --> 30:20.413
SAFE AT ALL THIS WEEK.

30:20.448 --> 30:22.586
>> I KNOW THE VOTES ARE THERE
FOR YOU TO BE SAFE.

30:22.620 --> 30:23.206
>> GOT IT.

30:23.241 --> 30:25.034
>> IF THAT HAPPENS, OKAY?

30:25.068 --> 30:27.068
>> YEAH, I'M SUPER GOOD WITH
THAT.

30:27.103 --> 30:28.241
I'M, LIKE, ALL IN.

30:28.275 --> 30:30.448
BUT I APPRECIATE YOU KEEPING ME
SAFE THIS WEEKEND.

30:30.482 --> 30:32.655
I 100% WILL KEEP YOU SAFE NEXT
WEEK.

30:32.689 --> 30:34.275
>> PERFECT.

30:34.310 --> 30:38.206
NATALIE'S A THREAT, BUT SHE'S
ACTUALLY NOT MY FIRST CHOICE

30:38.241 --> 30:40.206
THOOG WEEK SO I'M BEING HONEST
WITH HER.

30:40.241 --> 30:41.034
>> TOM, THANK YOU.

30:41.068 --> 30:44.551
>> THANK YOU.

30:44.586 --> 30:46.034
OKAY, HAVE A SEAT HERE.

30:46.068 --> 30:51.689
SO, I HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR YOU.

30:51.724 --> 30:57.034
I WANT TO PUT YOU ON THE BLOCK
AS A PAWN.

30:57.068 --> 30:58.413
I WANT YOU TO WIN THE VETO.

30:58.448 --> 30:59.965
I WANT YOU TO USE THE VETO ON
YOURSELF.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.965
>> AND I DON'T THEN...?

31:02.000 --> 31:03.793
>> YOU'RE NOT THE TARGET.

31:03.827 --> 31:08.896
IN EXCHANGE FOR ME MAKING SURE
THAT YOU STAY, WHEN YOU WIN

31:08.931 --> 31:12.689
H.O.H., YOU DON'T PUT ME ON THE
BLOCK.

31:12.724 --> 31:17.241
>> LIKE, I'M A TEAM PLAYER, AND
I'M LOYAL, BUT IT MAKES ME

31:17.275 --> 31:17.862
UNEASY.

31:17.896 --> 31:19.724
>> IT'S NOT AN EASY THING.

31:19.758 --> 31:22.310
>> I'M TRYING TO TRUST YOU, TOM.

31:22.344 --> 31:25.965
IT WAS HARD THE LAST FEW DAYS.

31:26.000 --> 31:29.379
>> I AM BEING HONEST AND
TRUTHFUL THAT-- THAT YOU ARE NOT

31:29.413 --> 31:30.517
THE TARGET.

31:30.551 --> 31:34.379
>> I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS IS A
TRUE CONVERSATION.

31:34.413 --> 31:38.206
>> I DON'T WANT LOLO TO GO THIS
WEEK, EITHER.

31:38.241 --> 31:40.896
BUT I DO HAVE A TARGET IN MIND.

31:40.931 --> 31:46.034
HELLO, RICKY.

31:46.068 --> 31:46.896
>> HERE WE GO.

31:46.931 --> 31:47.689
>> LET'S DO THIS.

31:47.724 --> 31:51.517
>> THANKS, MAN.

31:51.551 --> 31:54.413
>> WHAT'S UP?

31:54.448 --> 31:56.241
>> SO I HAVE A PROPOSAL.

31:56.275 --> 31:58.103
>> YEAH.

31:58.137 --> 32:00.551
>> LAST TIME I WAS H.O.H., I
WANTED RICKY OUT.

32:00.586 --> 32:04.137
THIS TIME I'M H.O.H., I'M GOING
TO TRY AGAIN.

32:04.172 --> 32:06.448
HE'S ORCHESTRATING ALL THE MOVES
FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE

32:06.482 --> 32:09.758
HOUSE, AND I HAVE TO GET HIM
BEFORE HE GETS ME.

32:09.793 --> 32:14.034
FIRST OF ALL, I'D LIKE TO KEEP
THIS CONVERSATION CONFIDENTIAL.

32:14.068 --> 32:17.620
I'D LIKE TO PUT YOU ON THE
BLOCK.

32:17.655 --> 32:19.413
GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO WIN VETO.

32:19.448 --> 32:21.413
I WANT YOU TO WIN VETO.

32:21.448 --> 32:25.068
I WANT YOU TO TAKE YOURSELF OFF
THE BLOCK.

32:25.103 --> 32:31.724
IF YOU DON'T WIN VETO, I WANT TO
FIGHT FOR YOUR VOTES TO STAY.

32:31.758 --> 32:36.137
I'VE TOLD HIM THAT I'M GOING TO
TRY TO MAKE SURE HE'S NOT VOTED

32:36.172 --> 32:36.655
OUT.

32:36.689 --> 32:37.896
THAT IS A LIE, OKAY?

32:37.931 --> 32:39.275
I LIED.

32:39.310 --> 32:41.137
SORRY, WE'RE ON "BIG BROTHER."

32:41.172 --> 32:42.551
SORRY-- THERE'S MY CANADIAN
ACCENT.

32:42.586 --> 32:45.724
I DO THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING
TO BE HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD SOON.

32:45.758 --> 32:49.758
SO IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT, I'D
LIKE TO BE KEPT SAFE.

32:49.793 --> 32:53.172
AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THE GIST
OF IT.

32:53.206 --> 32:56.344
>> TOM'S OFFER IS NOT REALLY AN
OFFER AT ALL.

32:56.379 --> 32:58.896
HE'S BASICALLY SAYING, "THE ONLY
WAY YOU'RE GOING TO STAY IN THE

32:58.931 --> 33:01.000
HOUSE IS IF YOU WIN THE POWER OF
VETO."

33:01.034 --> 33:04.034
HE'LL TAKE CREDIT FOR IT, AND,
THEREFORE, IF I WIN THE NEXT

33:04.068 --> 33:05.344
H.O.H., I SHOULD KEEP HIM SAFE.

33:05.379 --> 33:07.482
I'M NOT AN IDIOT, TOM.

33:07.517 --> 33:08.724
I HAVE A DIFFERENT PROPOSAL.

33:08.758 --> 33:09.758
>> OKAY.

33:09.793 --> 33:12.793
>> THERE'S NO GUARANTEES IN THAT
GAME, OBVIOUSLY.

33:12.827 --> 33:17.689
BETWEEN NATALIE, LOLO, AND
MYSELF, WE HAD ENOUGH VOTES TO

33:17.724 --> 33:19.793
EVICT YOU, AND WE DIDN'T.

33:19.827 --> 33:21.586
>> THANK YOU.

33:21.620 --> 33:29.137
>> AND IF YOU DON'T NOMINATE ME
OR NATALIE OR LOLO, YOUR CHANCES

33:29.172 --> 33:33.241
OF STAYING ANOTHER WEEK GO
THROUGH THE ROOF.

33:33.275 --> 33:36.482

IF TOM IS SMART, HE'LL TAKE OUR

MUCH ASSURES HIM TO FINAL FIVE.

33:46.241 --> 33:48.827

GOING TO LET OUR ALLIANCE STICK

33:48.862 --> 33:49.862
