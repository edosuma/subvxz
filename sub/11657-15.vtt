(mellow music playing)

01:00.567 --> 01:03.600
Well, here we are.

01:04.333 --> 01:05.000
Rose...

01:06.500 --> 01:08.266
-Please.
-I can't, Al.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.567
We've been seeing each other
for a month, Rose.

01:11.467 --> 01:13.433
I've never wanted anyone so much.

01:14.600 --> 01:15.633
What about your place?

01:15.700 --> 01:19.400
My sister's there. She's an insomniac.
We'd have an audience.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.700
Well, I can't let you stay here,
I just can't.

01:22.767 --> 01:26.266
Well, I simply can't take you to a hotel.
It just cheapens it.

01:27.100 --> 01:28.700
(scoffs)

01:29.300 --> 01:30.367
I guess we're doomed.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.066
Let's talk inside.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.200
The thing is, I've never done this before,
bring someone home.

01:42.266 --> 01:43.233
I understand.

01:45.633 --> 01:46.667
Are you quiet?

01:53.400 --> 01:54.166
I'm whispering.

01:54.233 --> 01:55.133
(chuckles)

01:56.000 --> 01:59.333
I don't mean now. I mean, then.

01:59.400 --> 02:02.867
Oh, very quiet. I'm very quiet.

02:02.934 --> 02:06.100
I don't scream, I don't shout,
very quiet person.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.100
I even wear quiet clothes, all solids.

02:10.934 --> 02:11.867
I'm quiet, too.

02:11.934 --> 02:13.600
Then we'll be fine!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.567
I don't want the others to know
you're here.

02:15.633 --> 02:16.767
They'll never know.

02:17.667 --> 02:20.166
In the morning,
we're getting up early to play golf.

02:20.233 --> 02:21.567
You can leave while they're gone.

02:21.633 --> 02:22.533
Great.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.333
They won't know?

02:24.400 --> 02:25.367
Never.

02:26.066 --> 02:28.633
Ok, but quiet.

02:28.700 --> 02:30.066
Like a mouse.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.500
(mellow music playing)

02:38.200 --> 02:39.100
Good morning.

02:39.467 --> 02:43.300
Oh, boy, that must have been some dream
you were having last night.

02:44.834 --> 02:45.967
What are you talking about?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.900
I never heard such a racket.

02:50.867 --> 02:53.600
I thought you were making love.
(laughs)

02:54.567 --> 02:59.033
No, no, I wasn't, no.
It was a nightmare, an awful nightmare.

02:59.100 --> 02:59.800
Just terrible.

03:00.734 --> 03:03.200
Isn't it interesting
how the sounds are the same

03:03.266 --> 03:05.266
for awful nightmares and great sex?

03:07.667 --> 03:08.600
Really?

03:08.667 --> 03:09.867
I wouldn't know.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.300
Oh, Dorothy, come on.

03:12.367 --> 03:13.934
Shouldn't we get going, girls?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.834
When you're making love,
you don't make noise?

03:15.900 --> 03:16.600
No.

03:16.667 --> 03:17.900
How can you not?

03:17.967 --> 03:21.133
Well, I guess I always felt
it wasn't very ladylike.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.266
-We should go, girls.
-Hold your bladder, Rose.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.433
Not a sound?

03:26.867 --> 03:29.033
Well, it never seemed to warrant one.

03:29.100 --> 03:30.567
Do you talk?

03:31.066 --> 03:33.500
I've always wanted to, but at that point,

03:33.567 --> 03:36.500
it seems that nobody
is ever interested in conversation.

03:37.934 --> 03:39.266
Not conversation.

03:39.333 --> 03:40.266
I mean...

03:41.200 --> 03:41.934
dirty talk.

03:44.100 --> 03:45.333
Dirty talk?

03:45.400 --> 03:47.533
Well, not filth, for God's sake!

03:49.000 --> 03:50.166
Dirty talk?

03:50.700 --> 03:52.333
-Morning, Sophia.
-Morning, Ma.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.367
-Morning, Sophia.
-Morning.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.200
-Dirty talk?
-Later.

03:55.266 --> 03:56.800
There's a man in your bed.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.934
Oh, Sophia, there's not.

04:04.000 --> 04:08.734
-Why, you devil, you.
-So that was what we heard, Rose!

04:10.533 --> 04:11.800
Rose got lucky.

04:11.867 --> 04:13.166
Not so lucky.

04:13.233 --> 04:14.467
The man in your bed is dead.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.066
What?

04:19.133 --> 04:20.066
Dead.

04:20.133 --> 04:24.367
Oh, Sophia. He's not dead.
I was just in there.

04:24.433 --> 04:28.300
So was I. I went to put back your laundry,
and I see there's a man in the bed,

04:28.367 --> 04:30.734
so I introduce myself,
but he doesn't answer.

04:31.200 --> 04:32.166
He's dead.

04:33.667 --> 04:35.867
He's shy. He's very shy.

04:35.934 --> 04:37.767
Didn't sound so shy last night.

04:38.767 --> 04:42.900
Ok, fine. Let a dead guy lie there.
It's gonna be 98 degrees today.

04:42.967 --> 04:43.967
It won't be pretty.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.500
Oh, I'm sure he's not dead. Rose, go look.

04:50.567 --> 04:53.300
Come on, he's sleeping.
I don't want to wake him.

04:53.367 --> 04:55.567
You could light firecrackers
in his nostrils.

04:55.633 --> 04:56.467
You won't wake him.

04:59.734 --> 05:03.667
All right, now, Rose, go on.
I don't want dead people in my house.

05:04.567 --> 05:09.133
People? We are talking about one man,
who is probably sleeping.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.433
You don't think I could recognize death?

05:11.500 --> 05:14.900
I lived in a retirement home.
Death visited more often than children.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.667
-Rose, go on.
-Well, I can't.

05:18.734 --> 05:21.333
-Why?
-I'm afraid. You go.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.000
Oh, no. I can't go in there.

05:23.066 --> 05:26.300
I have a thing against dead people.
I've never seen one, I never intend to.

05:26.834 --> 05:28.867
Didn't you see your husband
when he was dead?

05:28.934 --> 05:31.000
Oh, no! I cannot look at dead people.

05:31.066 --> 05:32.433
That's why I don't even watch the news.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.700
Every now and then,
they stick a corpse in on you.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.700
You could be watching a perfectly
lovely little story about central America.

05:38.767 --> 05:40.467
All of a sudden, bam, a dead body!

05:41.533 --> 05:43.133
This is ridiculous.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.000
Here we sit,
calmly eating our bran flakes,

05:46.066 --> 05:47.900
when there could be a dead man
in the house.

05:47.967 --> 05:49.166
I'll go.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.934
-She's very brave.
-Boy, I'll say.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.266
I want someone to come with me.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.734
I'll go, I'll go. I'm from Sicily.
What's the big deal?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.834
He's not dead.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.734
But he'll wish he was
when those two barge in on him.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.567
Who is he?

06:12.300 --> 06:13.133
His name is Al.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.467
No. I mean, what's he do?

06:15.133 --> 06:16.266
He imports diamonds.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.400
Oh, damn, I hope he's not dead.

06:20.567 --> 06:21.834
He bought the farm.

06:22.767 --> 06:24.100
What farm?

06:26.266 --> 06:27.266
Rose, he's dead.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.166
-No.
-Yes.

06:30.633 --> 06:34.934
Oh, my God, the poor man.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.567
And with a new farm and everything.

06:42.834 --> 06:44.667
Honey, I'm sorry.

06:44.967 --> 06:49.367
-When did he die?
-I wasn't there, Rose. You were.

06:50.533 --> 06:53.100
You mean I slept with a dead man
last night?

06:53.166 --> 06:54.934
Honey, I sleep with 'em all the time.

06:57.133 --> 07:00.834
He was so quiet.
I just thought he was a sound sleeper.

07:01.533 --> 07:02.734
What'll we do?

07:02.800 --> 07:03.934
We call the police.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.367
I didn't murder him!

07:05.867 --> 07:10.100
Of course, you didn't murder him, honey.
He probably had a heart attack.

07:10.166 --> 07:13.133
Now look, his family has to be notified.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.000
Now, did he ever speak of any family?

07:15.300 --> 07:17.934
He had a sister he lives with.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.066
Yeah, what's her name?

07:19.600 --> 07:22.734
His name was Al Beatty.
Her name's Beatty, too. She never married.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.367
I suppose I have to tell her.

07:25.433 --> 07:28.633
Oh, yes, you do.
You cannot let the police tell her.

07:28.700 --> 07:31.734
The night George died, my telephone rang

07:31.800 --> 07:34.133
and a highway patrolman said,
"Pardon me, Ma'am.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.100
Do you have a yellow convertible
and a husband named George?"

07:37.166 --> 07:39.500
I said, "Yes, of course.
Good grief, what's happened?"

07:39.567 --> 07:41.066
And he said, "Hold on, Ma'am."

07:41.133 --> 07:44.066
Put me on hold,
with that music while you wait.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.934
I sat there at 2:00 in the morning,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.500
listening
to Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass.

07:52.533 --> 07:56.266
And then, after an eternity,
he comes back on the line, eating chips.

07:56.633 --> 07:59.100
And he says, "Oh, I'm sorry, Ma'am,
but I'm the only one here.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.500
My phone's been ringing off the hook."

08:00.567 --> 08:03.300
I said, "Officer, what about my husband?"

08:03.367 --> 08:06.800
and then he said, crunching his chips,
"Oh, he's dead.

08:07.767 --> 08:11.300
Wrong-way driver hit him head on.
Totally dead, Ma'am." Crunch-crunch.

08:14.633 --> 08:15.800
Oh, no!

08:15.867 --> 08:20.734
Puts me on hold and then eats Doritos
while he tells me my life is over.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.533
Oh, Rose has to tell her.
Rose won't eat chips.

08:25.533 --> 08:27.900
I never eat chips. I don't like 'em.

08:30.133 --> 08:31.533
They fall in my bra.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.767
(sighs)

08:37.233 --> 08:40.300
Well, honey, you've got to do it.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.867
His sister lives in Boca Raton.

08:43.934 --> 08:46.133
-I'll look it up.
-Oh, thank...

08:46.767 --> 08:47.533
(gasps)

08:47.600 --> 08:50.533
I can't sleep in a bed
that's had a dead person in it!

08:50.600 --> 08:52.600
-I just can't!
-You'll get a new bed.

08:52.667 --> 08:53.800
-And sheets.
-And sheets.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.600
And a blanket.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.033
Burn down the house.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.266
Oh, poor Al.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.000
And he just got a hair transplant.

09:03.467 --> 09:06.200
Here's a Beatty in Boca Raton.
It's the only one.

09:07.333 --> 09:09.667
And somebody told me
he just bought a farm.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.367
Oh, my God. What'll I say to her?

09:13.433 --> 09:16.600
-That he died in the bed of an idiot.
-(Dorothy) Ma!

09:18.567 --> 09:20.200
You tell the truth.

09:20.266 --> 09:23.500
I can't tell her the truth.
I can't tell her where he died.

09:24.266 --> 09:25.734
He died visiting.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.333
That's what you tell her.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.633
-Visiting.
-Right.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.467
Visiting, that's good.

09:30.533 --> 09:31.600
(gasping)

09:33.000 --> 09:34.533
(telephone clanking)

09:34.600 --> 09:37.000
Oh, I just can't believe he's dead!

09:38.533 --> 09:41.066
-I don't think she's home.
-It rang once!

09:44.000 --> 09:44.667
Hello?

09:46.367 --> 09:47.767
Is this Miss Beatty?

09:48.734 --> 09:49.834
I beg your pardon?

09:51.767 --> 09:54.367
Well, do you have a brother Al?

09:56.333 --> 09:57.200
I see.

09:57.934 --> 10:00.333
Well, I must have the wrong number.
I'm sorry.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.500
Wrong number?

10:02.700 --> 10:04.567
Right number, wrong person.

10:04.900 --> 10:06.033
What do you mean?

10:06.900 --> 10:09.233
That wasn't his sister. That was his wife.

10:11.734 --> 10:14.734
(somber music playing)

10:16.533 --> 10:20.300
(mellow music playing)

10:20.800 --> 10:22.233
He was married.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.734
I can't believe it.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.633
There's a married dead man in my bed!

10:28.934 --> 10:30.767
-Serves him right.
-Ma!

10:31.233 --> 10:32.266
He lied to her.

10:32.333 --> 10:33.834
I don't know why they do that.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.700
Don't they know
we'll sleep with 'em anyway?

10:38.700 --> 10:39.767
Well, what am I gonna do?

10:39.834 --> 10:41.900
I can't tell her
her husband died in my bed!

10:41.967 --> 10:43.900
Tell her you went to turn on
the sprinklers,

10:43.967 --> 10:45.433
and you found him on the lawn.

10:47.867 --> 10:50.166
-That's not bad.
-Oh, Rose.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.633
Well, I've never had to do this before,

10:54.700 --> 10:57.867
tell a wife that her husband's
been cheating on her with me.

10:57.934 --> 11:00.000
That's the hardest thing ever
to have to tell anybody.

11:00.066 --> 11:01.667
Oh, no, it's not.

11:02.133 --> 11:05.967
How about having to tell a pregnant woman
that her husband's been cheating on her...

11:06.033 --> 11:07.633
with her own sister?

11:08.633 --> 11:12.266
And you're the sister,
and you're pregnant, too,

11:13.200 --> 11:14.700
by her husband.

11:15.834 --> 11:18.500
You didn't.

11:20.433 --> 11:21.700
Not me!

11:21.767 --> 11:23.567
Last night on <i>Dallas</i>!

11:27.033 --> 11:30.233
Or <i>Dynasty</i> or <i>Falcon's Landing</i>
or one of those.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.233
They're all the same.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.867
Oh, I thought you were the one.

11:33.934 --> 11:37.233
Oh, please.
I could never do anything like that.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.800
If you saw my brother-in-law,
you'd know why.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.000
(laughs)

11:41.467 --> 11:43.800
Look, Rose,
you're gonna have to go tell her.

11:43.867 --> 11:46.200
She's probably worried sick already.

11:46.266 --> 11:50.367
But I've never done anything like this,
tell a woman her husband's been seeing me.

11:50.867 --> 11:53.533
And she'll say, "Why, that dirty rat.
I will kill him."

11:54.166 --> 11:57.166
You say, "Good news, darlin'.
You don't have to. He's dead."

11:58.600 --> 12:01.600
(mellow music playing)

12:07.900 --> 12:10.200
(doorbell rings)

12:18.033 --> 12:19.834
Hello. I'm Rose Nylund.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.166
I'll save you some time.

12:21.233 --> 12:25.433
I don't wear Avon, I have a mop,
and I'm still paying for an encyclopedia

12:25.500 --> 12:29.467
that my son used just once
to look up sexual genitalia, female.

12:30.533 --> 12:33.667
Mrs. Beatty, it's not that.
It's about your husband.

12:42.667 --> 12:43.767
He dumped you.

12:44.800 --> 12:48.700
You've been dating him and he dumped you,
and now you're getting even by telling me.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.600
No, that's not...

12:49.667 --> 12:52.767
I've heard this before,
I can't tell you how many times.

12:52.834 --> 12:53.834
You have?

12:53.900 --> 12:56.066
You think you're the first? Please.

12:56.533 --> 13:00.500
The first time Al slept with someone else
was on our honeymoon.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.467
No!

13:02.533 --> 13:03.600
In Paris.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.333
The chambermaid.

13:05.400 --> 13:09.266
He always had the sign on the door,
"Maid service requested."

13:10.834 --> 13:12.500
He slept with everyone.

13:12.567 --> 13:16.700
Secretaries, schoolteachers,
baby-sitters, neighbors, friends.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.066
Oh, one easter,
we gave our little boy some rabbits.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.533
They used to look at Al in amazement.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.400
How long had you been seeing him?

13:29.633 --> 13:30.467
About a month.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.233
But that's not why I'm here.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.967
I have bad news.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.834
Well, you couldn't be pregnant.

13:39.667 --> 13:44.433
Uh, last night,
Al had a heart attack and died.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.667
Oh, Mrs. Beatty, I'm so very, very sorry.

13:50.900 --> 13:52.967
Well, you must have the wrong Al.

13:53.734 --> 13:55.967
You've been sleeping
with someone else's Al.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.967
My Al is as healthy as a horse.
It can't be him!

14:00.834 --> 14:03.900
-Al Beatty from Boca Raton?
-Yes.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.667
You're telling me Al is dead?

14:07.734 --> 14:08.500
Yes.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.233
A heart attack is crazy.

14:12.700 --> 14:14.800
He was a runner.
He couldn't have a heart attack.

14:15.734 --> 14:18.633
I'm talking so it can't be true.
You know what I mean?

14:19.533 --> 14:21.500
If I keep talking, it isn't true.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.700
All I have to do is talk forever.

14:25.934 --> 14:27.700
Oh, God, Al.

14:29.367 --> 14:30.533
I'm all right.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.500
I'm ok.

14:32.633 --> 14:35.500
Al, the big jerk.

14:37.567 --> 14:38.533
I loved him.

14:39.967 --> 14:42.100
He was a decent man, you know?

14:42.533 --> 14:43.667
I know.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.800
-He was.
-Caring.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.100
Very.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.100
Special.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.834
And it's all my fault!

14:53.433 --> 14:55.100
He had a heart attack.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.834
It's not your fault.

14:56.900 --> 14:59.066
He had a heart attack with me.

14:59.633 --> 15:03.367
Mrs. Beatty, my late husband
had a heart attack with me as well.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.066
They drop like flies around me!

15:07.600 --> 15:11.667
Mrs. Nylund, you're not responsible
for the death of my husband.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.033
I'll never date again.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.266
-You will.
-I won't! I can't!

15:16.333 --> 15:18.867
-In time, you'll forget this.
-Never!

15:19.834 --> 15:21.300
I promise you.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.734
It's ok. I'll get used to being alone.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.500
-Mrs. Nylund.
-Yes?

15:28.567 --> 15:31.500
You've been sleeping with my husband,
and he's died.

15:31.567 --> 15:33.533
See if you can pull yourself together,

15:33.600 --> 15:36.300
because in a minute,
I'm going to need some comforting myself!

15:38.133 --> 15:41.133
(somber music playing)

15:46.934 --> 15:49.500
All right Dorothy, try this dressing
and tell me what you think.

15:49.567 --> 15:51.166
It's called creamy zesty Italian.

15:51.233 --> 15:52.367
Only has one calorie.

15:53.033 --> 15:56.500
Mmm. If you ran it under the faucet,
it would have more flavor.

15:57.266 --> 15:58.633
Shoot.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.834
Honey, beware of anyone who says,
"No calories,"

16:01.900 --> 16:03.400
"Absolutely no charge,"

16:03.467 --> 16:06.033
and, "Let's just lie down on the bed
and watch television."

16:08.333 --> 16:09.600
-Hi.
-(Dorothy) Did you do it?

16:09.867 --> 16:10.767
-Yep.
-(Blanche) And?

16:12.533 --> 16:14.400
I'm gonna become a nun.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.867
I'm the kiss of death.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.600
It's the second time
a man has died in my bed.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.967
The second time?

16:21.633 --> 16:22.667
Dorothy knows.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.400
-Charlie.
-(gasps)

16:24.467 --> 16:25.700
-No!
-Yes.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.100
What exactly do you do in bed, Rose?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.767
Nothing. I do nothing.

16:33.834 --> 16:36.266
Well, maybe that's it.
They have to do it all.

16:40.166 --> 16:44.533
Come on, Blanche. It's not her fault.
She has a perfectly normal sex life.

16:45.266 --> 16:47.967
Now, I knew somebody
who had seven husbands,

16:48.033 --> 16:50.500
and six of them died of stomach ailments.

16:50.567 --> 16:51.834
Well, they arrested her.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.033
She'd been putting ground glass
in their salads.

16:54.567 --> 16:55.433
Why?

16:55.500 --> 16:57.700
Because she ran out of croutons!

17:00.000 --> 17:02.400
Because she wanted to kill them, Rose.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.567
We had a neighbor in Minnesota
who killed her husband.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.533
She backed over him with a combine,
and she didn't even know she had done it

17:10.600 --> 17:13.400
until she found little bits of plaid
in the corn.

17:16.533 --> 17:20.066
She said, "Funny, that looks like
bits of Joe's plaid shirt.

17:21.066 --> 17:24.100
And that looks like bits
of Joe's overalls.

17:24.500 --> 17:29.300
And that looks like bits of Joe's arms.
That looks like..."

17:29.367 --> 17:31.500
Rose! We get the picture.

17:32.867 --> 17:33.600
(sighs)

17:34.233 --> 17:36.467
-They had a very little coffin.
-Upp!

17:43.767 --> 17:47.100
Listen, Rose, you are not to blame.
Now, you know that.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.767
Of course, I know that.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.767
She was driving the combine.
I wasn't anywhere near their farm!

17:54.300 --> 17:57.300
(mellow music playing)

18:02.834 --> 18:05.967
Come on, Rose, it'll be fun.
You like square dancing.

18:06.033 --> 18:06.900
No, thanks.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.967
Oh, Rose, you're only gonna be dancing
with men.

18:09.033 --> 18:13.200
-You can't kill 'em by doing that.
-Nope. No more men.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.433
-That's it for me.
-No more men.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.900
My God, I would die. I would just die.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.367
-It's not like no more food, Blanche.
-It's worse.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.533
There are many women
who live happy lives without men.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.700
Oh, who?

18:25.767 --> 18:28.233
Well, Inga Lundqvist.

18:28.300 --> 18:30.500
Who was she, some Swedish lesbian?

18:31.934 --> 18:33.133
She was a neighbor of ours.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.900
Not by chance
the one who shredded her husband

18:35.967 --> 18:37.233
with some farm machinery?

18:37.700 --> 18:38.900
Yes!

18:39.567 --> 18:41.367
And she never remarried.

18:41.433 --> 18:44.834
And she led a very happy
rest of her life baking,

18:44.900 --> 18:47.266
sewing, gardening, tending the animals.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.900
Ooh, my favorite things.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.100
Ok, let's get this show on the road!

18:52.967 --> 18:55.066
Rose, you sure you don't want to come
and just watch?

18:55.533 --> 18:58.934
Come on, Rose. You'll sit and watch
my dentures eat corn on the cob.

18:59.000 --> 18:59.967
It's a lot of laughs!

19:02.133 --> 19:04.166
No, I don't want to kill anyone else.

19:04.233 --> 19:07.033
Honey, you sure you're gonna be
all right here alone?

19:07.100 --> 19:10.300
She'll be fine. If someone breaks in,
she'll just have to sleep with them.

19:13.100 --> 19:16.100
(mellow music playing)

19:18.200 --> 19:19.600
(doorbell rings)

19:26.600 --> 19:27.333
Who is it?

19:27.767 --> 19:28.867
(Mrs. Beatty) Mrs. Beatty.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.734
Oh, Mrs. Beatty, come in.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.667
I just had to come by.

19:34.100 --> 19:37.467
You were so caring
to come tell me in person what happened

19:37.533 --> 19:38.834
that I had to do something for you.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.400
Oh, that wasn't necessary.

19:41.467 --> 19:44.300
Well, I know you blame yourself
for Al's death.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.133
Well, I just got the autopsy results,

19:47.200 --> 19:51.266
and they showed that Al's arteries
were completely clogged.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.467
Oh, his diet was terrible.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.734
He never ate a vegetable,
he lived on fatty foods.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.500
He'd have meat for dessert.

19:58.567 --> 20:01.133
You didn't kill him, Mrs. Nylund.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.867
He killed himself.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.066
He committed suicide?

20:08.066 --> 20:10.133
In a manner of speaking.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.700
He'd have died
whether he'd been here or not.

20:13.166 --> 20:17.200
-I'm so glad, not that he's dead.
-I know.

20:17.266 --> 20:20.767
I just had to tell you
you had nothing to do with it.

20:20.834 --> 20:21.934
Thank you.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.767
And if he had to die, I'm glad
he didn't die alone on the street,

20:26.834 --> 20:31.967
but here, with a caring person,
doing what he liked to do best.

20:33.700 --> 20:36.734
(light music playing)

20:45.800 --> 20:47.233
-Ma!
-What?

20:48.800 --> 20:51.100
Will you stop telling her what to play!

20:51.166 --> 20:52.967
I'm not saying a word.
Did I speak, Blanche?

20:53.033 --> 20:53.934
Not a word.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.467
You keep shaking your head!

20:55.533 --> 20:57.934
I've been holding it up for 80 years.
You'd shake, too.

21:00.233 --> 21:02.834
Well, what do you think?

21:02.900 --> 21:04.166
Of what, honey?

21:04.233 --> 21:05.433
My new dress.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.133
-Oh, is that new?
-Yes.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.867
It's sort of old-fashioned looking.
I wasn't sure it was new.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.800
Oh, that's the style. The girl told me.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.367
What was she, a pilgrim?

21:15.433 --> 21:17.333
Come on, Blanche.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.700
You look wonderful, Rose,
absolutely lovely.

21:20.767 --> 21:22.834
Well, I suppose I should go.

21:22.900 --> 21:24.967
I haven't had a date in three months.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.934
But I just don't know what to do.
I adore Arnie.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.867
He's the sweetest man in the world
and very special to me,

21:30.934 --> 21:34.967
and it'll be hard not to, you know,
'cause I like him so much

21:35.033 --> 21:39.333
and since we're going away for the weekend
and since we already have, if I don't,

21:39.400 --> 21:40.867
then he'll think I don't like him anymore,

21:40.934 --> 21:43.567
and I do, so maybe I will,
but I don't know.

21:43.633 --> 21:44.400
I might not.

21:44.467 --> 21:45.333
Rose!

21:46.000 --> 21:46.700
(chuckles)

21:46.767 --> 21:51.033
Rose, honey, you know
you were not responsible for Al's death,

21:51.100 --> 21:54.700
so why don't you go on, have a good time,
and whatever happens, happens.

21:54.767 --> 21:59.200
I know Al had bad arteries,
but still, I can't be totally sure.

21:59.667 --> 22:00.433
Come on now, Rose.

22:00.500 --> 22:04.800
You do what makes you comfortable
and don't worry about anything else.

22:06.133 --> 22:06.834
Ok.

22:09.066 --> 22:12.834
-Well, I'm off.
-Totally!

22:14.834 --> 22:17.867
(mellow music playing)

22:23.934 --> 22:26.133
I wonder where she is.
She's almost two hours late.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.834
Oh, they probably had traffic.

22:27.900 --> 22:29.533
I bet she slept with him.

22:30.834 --> 22:32.934
I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't.

22:33.667 --> 22:36.467
Well, I sure couldn't be
with a man I liked and abstain.

22:37.533 --> 22:40.834
You know, I abstained
after Stan and I split up,

22:42.767 --> 22:46.367
but it wasn't a very different experience
from when Stan and I were together.

22:49.533 --> 22:51.500
-Oh, here she is.
-(Blanche) Well?

22:51.567 --> 22:54.100
-What happened? How was it?
-What? What, what, what?

22:54.166 --> 22:56.500
-You had a terrible time?
-You had a wonderful time?

22:56.567 --> 22:58.266
Honey, tell us what happened!

22:59.300 --> 22:59.967
Arnie.

23:00.600 --> 23:01.867
I slept with him.

23:01.934 --> 23:02.700
And?

23:03.166 --> 23:04.166
He died.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.734
-What?
-Oh, no, Rose.

23:11.200 --> 23:15.467
And the sheriff,
I told him about me, how I kill men.

23:17.233 --> 23:18.667
And he didn't believe me!

23:19.367 --> 23:21.667
He said, "Let's see. Sleep with me."

23:23.767 --> 23:25.033
So I did.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.200
And the sheriff died.

23:31.567 --> 23:33.600
(laughs)

23:36.700 --> 23:38.567
Arnie's fine!

23:38.633 --> 23:40.900
We had a wonderful time.
Everything's terrific.

23:40.967 --> 23:42.500
I was only joking!

23:44.433 --> 23:45.367
You what?

23:45.433 --> 23:46.967
(cackles)
It was a joke!

23:47.033 --> 23:49.166
-A joke?
-That's a terrible joke!
