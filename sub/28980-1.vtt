02:00.038 --> 02:03.836
- This is Lieutenant
Thomas, Venus explorer.

02:03.836 --> 02:04.730
Guess what?

02:04.730 --> 02:06.821
Our space flight was successful.

02:06.821 --> 02:07.738
We made it!

02:14.660 --> 02:18.775
The Vieutian beasts appear
to have a rudimentary city.

02:18.775 --> 02:19.894
We must be careful.

02:19.894 --> 02:20.894
Right Felix?

02:21.828 --> 02:23.901
Do you copy sidekick?

02:24.734 --> 02:26.477
What are you doing?

02:26.477 --> 02:29.674
- I'm exploring Venus, remember?

02:29.674 --> 02:31.265
- You need good air.

02:31.265 --> 02:33.848
- Maybe I adapted to Venus air.

02:47.657 --> 02:49.657
- See, that's great now.

02:52.219 --> 02:53.413
- Thomas.

02:53.413 --> 02:55.001
- I'm supposed to be alone mom.

02:55.001 --> 02:58.008
Being this is an uninhabited planet.

02:58.008 --> 03:01.070
- Actually, you're supposed
to be getting ready to leave.

03:01.070 --> 03:03.285
I told Mrs. Paul we'd
be there 10 minutes ago.

03:03.285 --> 03:04.566
- Who's Mrs. Paul?

03:04.566 --> 03:05.828
- Chester's mom.

03:05.828 --> 03:07.688
- Why am I going
to see Chester's mom?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.428
- You're going to see Chester.

03:09.428 --> 03:10.313
- Who?

03:10.313 --> 03:12.275
- He'll be in your class in the fall.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.933
- Not another one.

03:13.933 --> 03:16.118
- And Felix stays here.

03:16.118 --> 03:20.785
You're going to Chester's to
actually play with Chester.

03:32.425 --> 03:34.555
- I just don't want a repeat
of last fall to Rock Island.

03:34.555 --> 03:38.722
- Me either, that's why I
set this appointment up.

03:39.695 --> 03:41.023
Ready?

03:41.023 --> 03:42.331
- Nope.

03:42.331 --> 03:46.716
- You look like you got
some provisions here.

03:46.716 --> 03:47.716
Legos, okay.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.090
What's with all these clothes?

03:53.952 --> 03:55.185
- Be prepared.

03:55.185 --> 03:56.359
You know?

03:56.359 --> 03:58.004
- Okay.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.776
- Let's get this over with.

03:59.776 --> 04:02.146
- It's gonna be fun.

04:02.146 --> 04:03.205
- There's no Felix?

04:03.205 --> 04:05.139
- It's a human only trip.

04:05.139 --> 04:06.149
- Yup.

04:06.149 --> 04:07.399
Just us people.

04:15.210 --> 04:16.343
The trick is to outrun them.

04:16.343 --> 04:18.164
You don't want to get caught.

04:18.164 --> 04:18.997
Yes!

04:18.997 --> 04:20.069
Like that!

04:20.069 --> 04:22.069
Did you see that Thomas?

04:31.201 --> 04:32.368
You want next?

04:35.052 --> 04:35.885
- Thanks.

04:37.742 --> 04:39.575
- How goes it?

04:40.639 --> 04:42.722
- As smooth as Pop Rocks.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.629
- You should get ready to play.

04:47.629 --> 04:50.545
I don't think Chester's very good at this.

04:50.545 --> 04:52.133
- I've gotta get in all
my screen time today,

04:52.133 --> 04:55.218
'cause there won't be any at camp.

04:55.218 --> 04:56.815
Are you going to camp?

04:56.815 --> 04:58.765
Did they have camp in Illinois?

04:58.765 --> 05:00.932
Around here everyone goes.

05:04.022 --> 05:04.855
Oh no!

05:06.554 --> 05:09.893
Okay, you could have next next turn.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.367
Camp is toad's awesome.

05:11.367 --> 05:14.950
Aside from the no screen
thing, that sucks.

05:22.380 --> 05:23.213
Mom!

05:24.795 --> 05:28.712
You're a nut job!

05:36.159 --> 05:38.742
- Can you pass the peas please?

05:40.650 --> 05:42.008
Thank you.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.425
- You're welcome.

05:48.688 --> 05:49.612
Shut up.

05:49.612 --> 05:51.182
- Excuse me?

05:51.182 --> 05:53.635
- I was talking to Felix.

05:53.635 --> 05:54.468
- See.

05:54.468 --> 05:55.764
- I know.

05:55.764 --> 05:56.597
I know.

05:56.597 --> 05:57.430
- What?

06:00.581 --> 06:01.692
- Hey!

06:01.692 --> 06:04.027
- Your dad and I think you're spending

06:04.027 --> 06:05.957
too much time with Felix,

06:05.957 --> 06:08.354
and not enough time
with kids your own age.

06:08.354 --> 06:09.404
- That's silly.

06:09.404 --> 06:10.619
I just saw Chester.

06:10.619 --> 06:13.409
- Yeah, and his mother banned
you from her house forever.

06:13.409 --> 06:16.492
- Felix will think this is hilarious.

06:18.992 --> 06:21.949
- Listen, we just want you to make friends

06:21.949 --> 06:23.090
before the school year.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.057
- I have a friend.

06:25.057 --> 06:26.075
A good friend.

06:26.075 --> 06:29.155
- If you spend as much time making friends

06:29.155 --> 06:30.642
as you do making things up--

06:30.642 --> 06:33.559
- Thomas, since we are the parents,

06:34.412 --> 06:37.387
we've talked about it and--

06:37.387 --> 06:38.220
- And we

06:39.766 --> 06:41.162
are

06:41.162 --> 06:43.523
sending you to summer camp.

06:43.523 --> 06:46.023
You're going to Slumber Falls.

06:46.995 --> 06:48.381
- It's gonna be great.

06:48.381 --> 06:49.214
I went to camp when I was a kid.

06:49.214 --> 06:51.059
I had a fantastic time.

06:51.059 --> 06:52.729
- Felix doesn't like swimming.

06:52.729 --> 06:53.608
Or water even.

06:53.608 --> 06:54.842
- Tom.

06:55.766 --> 06:59.456
We don't think you should take Felix.

06:59.456 --> 07:01.420
- It's just, none of the other kids

07:01.420 --> 07:04.124
are gonna have a teddy bear.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.607
- He's a fox.

07:05.607 --> 07:10.180
- Well, they're not really
gonna have a fox either.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.254
Come on, it'll be great for you.

07:11.254 --> 07:13.411
You get to meet the other kids and--

07:13.411 --> 07:15.672
- How can I make friends with other kids?

07:15.672 --> 07:18.428
You guys keep moving me around.

07:18.428 --> 07:21.604
I've been friends with Felix forever.

07:21.604 --> 07:23.566
- I am sure you and the other kids

07:23.566 --> 07:25.899
are gonna have a great time.

07:35.154 --> 07:35.987
- I know.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.474
- Thomas?

07:59.341 --> 08:01.591
It's time to say goodnight.

08:03.556 --> 08:05.723
You wanna sing it with me?

09:48.558 --> 09:51.804

09:51.804 --> 09:53.284

11:19.598 --> 11:22.235
I didn't pack him like a rain jacket or--

11:22.235 --> 11:23.630

11:29.234 --> 11:30.563
- That's our canteen?

11:30.563 --> 11:31.396
- I'm so gonna drown.

11:31.396 --> 11:32.378
- No you're not.
- No you won't.

11:32.378 --> 11:33.529
- No you won't,
you're a good swimmer.

11:33.529 --> 11:34.362
You're just being dramatic.

11:34.362 --> 11:35.647
You know that we're gonna miss you.

11:35.647 --> 11:37.980
- It's gonna be fun alright.

11:44.031 --> 11:45.770
You know what, he's gonna be fine.

11:45.770 --> 11:46.603
He'll probably call us tonight

11:46.603 --> 11:50.103
telling us how much fun he's having right?

11:51.221 --> 11:52.054
- Yeah.

12:03.059 --> 12:04.976
- Because, mom says so!

12:08.789 --> 12:09.622
What?

12:29.736 --> 12:31.721
- This is the guy.

12:31.721 --> 12:34.554
Your mom is gonna buy me a new TV.

12:38.418 --> 12:40.372
It's a sign of the Order of the Owl.

12:40.372 --> 12:41.421
It's sacred.

12:41.421 --> 12:42.832
Members only.

12:42.832 --> 12:44.842
And don't try to steal one.

12:44.842 --> 12:48.190
- You try to steal one,
Ian the terrible will,

12:48.190 --> 12:49.489
break your legs.

12:49.489 --> 12:51.463
- He broke Ben Hensley's leg last year,

12:51.463 --> 12:53.225
just for running in the dining hall!

12:53.225 --> 12:55.308
- Broke it right in half!

13:03.258 --> 13:04.615
- I'm up top.

13:04.615 --> 13:05.837
Do you pee the bed?

13:05.837 --> 13:08.074
- He does.

13:08.074 --> 13:10.491
- Only when I drink Kool-Aid.

13:27.559 --> 13:30.392
- Just like I thought it would be.

13:41.409 --> 13:42.452
- What are you doing?

13:42.452 --> 13:43.693
- I was just--

13:43.693 --> 13:45.078
- Oh wait, I forgot, I don't care.

13:45.078 --> 13:46.744
It's swim trials.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.327
Get out there asap.

13:49.536 --> 13:51.666
Bring your canteen.

13:51.666 --> 13:54.162
Canteen goes with you everywhere.

13:54.162 --> 13:57.245
And your swimsuit, get your swimsuit.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.317
And stay inside the white rocks,

14:00.317 --> 14:01.452
or else you'll wind up off the path

14:01.452 --> 14:04.285
and lost and a bear might eat you.

14:05.544 --> 14:08.871
And I'll be the one looking for you.

14:15.219 --> 14:18.137
We do laps so that we can
tell if you're a good swimmer.

14:18.137 --> 14:20.437
If you're a good swimmer
you get a blue bead.

14:20.437 --> 14:22.402
If you do okay you get a yellow.

14:22.402 --> 14:23.652
And then a red.

14:24.509 --> 14:25.676
- And red for?

14:28.475 --> 14:29.808
- A non-swimmer.

14:30.805 --> 14:33.905
- No thanks, I'm a conscientious objector.

14:33.905 --> 14:36.322
I didn't even bring my towel.

14:51.138 --> 14:52.305
- Hey fill it.

14:53.419 --> 14:54.586
Stay hydrated.

14:55.556 --> 14:58.389
- I'm already like 75% water.

15:01.100 --> 15:01.933
Sorry.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.679
- Hi Thomas.

15:18.679 --> 15:19.847
- Hi clones.

15:19.847 --> 15:21.493
- You have to change for dinner.

15:21.493 --> 15:22.848
- Everyone has to go to every meal,

15:22.848 --> 15:24.181
even, red beads.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.154
- I'm not a red bead, I'm a no bead.

15:29.154 --> 15:31.158
I wear this bead in protest.

15:31.158 --> 15:32.021
- You have to wear it.

15:32.021 --> 15:34.021
So we know you'll drown.

15:38.490 --> 15:40.830
- I don't need your dumb blue beads.

15:40.830 --> 15:43.501
I've been to places you
can't even think of.

15:43.501 --> 15:44.584
The lake, ha!

15:45.529 --> 15:46.657
Kids stuff.

15:46.657 --> 15:49.657
I'll show you guys a real adventure.

16:07.471 --> 16:12.425
- Look, he's been playing
with his stuffed animal.

16:12.425 --> 16:13.425
Like a baby!

16:43.264 --> 16:45.879
- Trying new things is hard.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.962
- Don't say I didn't try.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.059
- Hey, that's for emergencies.

16:52.059 --> 16:54.109
- This is an emergency.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.201
- Thomas, how's camp?

16:58.201 --> 16:59.034
You making friends?

16:59.034 --> 17:00.712
- Dad, you need to come
and get me out of here.

17:00.712 --> 17:02.619
- Look, just hang in there.

17:02.619 --> 17:04.987
It'll make your mom so happy.

17:04.987 --> 17:05.819
- Does he sound okay?

17:05.819 --> 17:08.249
- He sounds fine, hold on a second.

17:08.249 --> 17:09.694
- They laughed at me.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.622
- What about Chester?

17:12.622 --> 17:15.528
- You're taking their side now.

17:15.528 --> 17:17.665
No one's on my side but me and Felix.

17:17.665 --> 17:18.758
- We're giving you a chance to

17:18.758 --> 17:20.148
get away from your stuffed animal

17:20.148 --> 17:22.905
and try to make some real friends.

17:22.905 --> 17:25.571
- Wait, what is he saying?

17:29.959 --> 17:31.652
- On our own Felix.

17:37.352 --> 17:38.685
- Dinner squirt.

17:40.365 --> 17:41.977
Hurry it up.

17:41.977 --> 17:45.910
The monster's in the mess hall tonight.

18:22.770 --> 18:24.687
- Good evening campers!

18:26.718 --> 18:30.368
- Good evening Counselor Mike!

18:30.368 --> 18:32.350
- I'd like to welcome you old hats

18:32.350 --> 18:34.246
back to Slumber Falls.

18:34.246 --> 18:37.288
And I'd like to welcome some
of our new campers as well.

18:37.288 --> 18:39.954
Now we here at Slumber Falls,
we have a little tradition.

18:39.954 --> 18:41.964
Just because it's summer, that doesn't

18:41.964 --> 18:43.138
mean that learning's done.

18:43.138 --> 18:44.796
Mm mm.

18:44.796 --> 18:46.556
You all know what I'm talking about.

18:46.556 --> 18:48.616
- Useless information

18:48.616 --> 18:49.533
of the day!

18:51.483 --> 18:52.392
- That's right.

18:52.392 --> 18:54.606
It's time for useless
information of the day.

18:54.606 --> 18:55.578
What day?

18:55.578 --> 18:56.995
- Day one!

18:58.044 --> 18:59.758
- And to help me out, I'm gonna need to

18:59.758 --> 19:01.324
bring up our monsters.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.676
So please, put your hands together

19:03.676 --> 19:07.143
for the monsters horror shop quartet.

19:11.519 --> 19:12.666
- Trio!

19:12.666 --> 19:13.583
- Oh, trio.

19:21.466 --> 19:22.900
- It's time for.

19:57.261 --> 19:59.594
in the entire state of Iowa.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.813
That's cool.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.002
- What, you don't wanna see the monsters?

20:25.002 --> 20:26.148
- I've already seen them.

20:26.148 --> 20:27.003
- Oh yeah?

20:27.003 --> 20:29.364
You caught the early?

20:29.364 --> 20:30.962
- Exactly.

20:30.962 --> 20:32.263
Great show.

20:32.263 --> 20:33.322
Excuse me.

20:33.322 --> 20:34.437
- Nah da da da.

20:34.437 --> 20:36.296
Hold up, there is no early show.

20:36.296 --> 20:37.490
Go back to your seat.

20:37.490 --> 20:39.157
- I don't even know what
they're talking about.

20:39.157 --> 20:39.990
Iowa?

20:39.990 --> 20:41.281
Scientists?

20:41.281 --> 20:42.114
Monkeys?

20:44.358 --> 20:45.851
- Is there a problem here?

20:45.851 --> 20:48.434
- There's no problem here, Ian.

20:49.595 --> 20:51.433
- Okay, well you can come with me squirt.

20:51.433 --> 20:54.683
You've wandered off one too many times.

20:56.564 --> 20:58.019
- You know, hold on Ian.

20:58.019 --> 21:01.686
This young man just
volunteered for KP duty.

21:08.174 --> 21:09.007
- KP?

21:11.283 --> 21:12.612
- Get your back into it.

21:12.612 --> 21:14.945
Really get into those beans.

21:18.069 --> 21:20.319
So, where were you heading?

21:21.719 --> 21:24.029
- Nowhere, just out.

21:24.029 --> 21:25.601
- Out's good.

21:25.601 --> 21:27.983
I had some things out there.

21:27.983 --> 21:29.900
Most I like especially.

21:30.788 --> 21:33.069
- Things like what?

21:33.069 --> 21:34.069
- Who knows.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.202
- Well it's gotta be better than here.

21:39.202 --> 21:41.512
They threw me in the water this morning.

21:41.512 --> 21:44.083
- Can't swim?

21:44.083 --> 21:46.546
- I can swim awesome.

21:46.546 --> 21:47.818
That was a protest.

21:47.818 --> 21:49.293
- Oh sure.

21:49.293 --> 21:52.652
Like running out of dinner was a protest?

21:52.652 --> 21:55.086
Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.

21:55.086 --> 21:57.406
Go find adventures where you like.

21:57.406 --> 21:59.489
- See, you understand me.

22:00.515 --> 22:02.834
I wanna go find adventures where I like.

22:02.834 --> 22:03.751
- Like say,

22:05.784 --> 22:07.784
run off into them woods?

22:09.805 --> 22:11.055
- I can manage.

22:12.057 --> 22:15.064
- Yeah, there's no one
there to tell you to swim.

22:15.064 --> 22:18.564
Say go to bed and live off the wilderness.

22:21.213 --> 22:24.630
You can live in your own world out there.

22:26.563 --> 22:29.713
I hear they have a nice
campfire opening night.

22:29.713 --> 22:32.130
That sound like an adventure?

22:34.660 --> 22:36.153
I'll take care of the rest.

22:36.153 --> 22:36.986
Maybe

22:38.233 --> 22:40.138
put up these tubs of dirty dishes

22:40.138 --> 22:41.333
off across the lake.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.833
Off to that land of Who Knows.

22:47.406 --> 22:48.239
- Thanks.

22:54.510 --> 22:55.343
- Oh boy.

23:05.524 --> 23:08.471
- I open this first campfire of the summer

23:08.471 --> 23:11.471
in the name of the Order of the Owl.

23:13.457 --> 23:15.707
We, like the owl, are wise.

23:17.032 --> 23:20.449
We respect the woods and the great totem.

23:22.367 --> 23:25.947
We stay on the path clearly marked.

23:25.947 --> 23:29.652
- Shh, I don't know what's
with the white rocks.

23:29.652 --> 23:33.069
- They just mark a safe path around here.

23:34.101 --> 23:35.814
- I heard they control the totem.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.681
- Oh great totem,

23:37.681 --> 23:40.049
help me to call down favors to help

23:40.049 --> 23:43.799
these young campers on
their summer journeys.

24:06.791 --> 24:08.874
Behold and be not afraid.

24:09.834 --> 24:12.751
The great forest totem is among us.

24:14.710 --> 24:16.210
- That's just Ian.

24:21.338 --> 24:23.349
- It's a sacred ceremony.

24:23.349 --> 24:25.641
Why can't you just get into it?

24:25.641 --> 24:28.657
Pretend along with the rest of the kids.

24:28.657 --> 24:29.549
Just go to your cabin.

24:29.549 --> 24:32.799
Just stay there all day for all I care.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.891
- We don't need these people
telling us when to eat,

24:41.891 --> 24:43.702
how to swim, and how much to drink.

24:43.702 --> 24:45.896
- Or how many
monkeys know sign language.

24:45.896 --> 24:46.729
- Yeah.

26:38.912 --> 26:39.745
- Your bead!

26:39.745 --> 26:41.866
- That's a sign of my oppression.

26:41.866 --> 26:45.112
Here we can make a new necklace.

26:45.112 --> 26:46.554
We're master swimmers.

26:46.554 --> 26:47.932
Shell level swimmers.

26:47.932 --> 26:50.616
- Man, we're gonna look good.

26:50.616 --> 26:53.783
- Now what shall we do with our world?

27:09.383 --> 27:10.966
Whoa, look at this.

27:12.374 --> 27:13.992
An ancient trail.

27:13.992 --> 27:15.906
- Maybe it's a sign of the totem.

27:15.906 --> 27:17.739
- Yeah right.

27:19.682 --> 27:21.973
I thought exploring took longer.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.890
- There is no set time.

27:44.018 --> 27:45.662
- This is definitely home base.

27:45.662 --> 27:47.522
Fortress in the Who Knows.

27:47.522 --> 27:49.726
- This is just like being
back at camp though.

27:49.726 --> 27:52.586
Foxes don't hang around home base.

27:52.586 --> 27:53.419
They roam.

27:54.528 --> 27:57.165
- There's no one to tell us
what to do or where to go.

27:57.165 --> 27:58.411
We can do anything we like.

27:58.411 --> 27:59.552
- We can roam?

27:59.552 --> 28:00.440
- Yeah.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.357
But we have a base now.

28:32.217 --> 28:33.307
Search party!

28:33.307 --> 28:34.557
- What?

28:37.748 --> 28:39.832
Should we say hi?

28:39.832 --> 28:42.884
- You don't understand
running away do you?

28:43.933 --> 28:45.472
Do you think they'll give up?

28:45.472 --> 28:47.380
- I don't think they can.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.036
Not until they find you.

28:50.036 --> 28:51.119
Or your body.

28:53.193 --> 28:55.120
- My body?

28:55.120 --> 28:57.212
- They've gotta know.

28:57.212 --> 28:58.770
You're either there

28:58.770 --> 29:01.270
or you know, in the Who Knows.

29:02.147 --> 29:02.980
- Weird.

29:05.535 --> 29:08.993
- Maybe we should go back.

29:08.993 --> 29:09.826
- No.

29:21.023 --> 29:23.252
So, we catch the fish

29:23.252 --> 29:25.752
and then we just eat the fish?

29:29.468 --> 29:31.885
- If it's cold, that's sushi.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.641
- Should we cook it?

29:38.623 --> 29:42.202
- It doesn't seem right to
cook anybody in the Who Knows.

29:42.202 --> 29:44.285
A man's gotta eat though.

29:48.105 --> 29:49.857
Got anything?

29:49.857 --> 29:51.429
- Nope.

29:51.429 --> 29:54.512
Are you sure fish like peanut butter?

29:55.537 --> 29:58.857
That kid Randy was allergic to nuts.

29:58.857 --> 30:03.025
Maybe fish are allergic to peanut butter.

30:03.025 --> 30:04.358
- Yeah.

30:05.855 --> 30:10.140
♪ Useless information of the day ♪

30:10.140 --> 30:10.973
- Stop it.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.107
Hey, Felix.

30:31.280 --> 30:35.780
It gets dark pretty quickly
out here in the Who Knows.

30:36.900 --> 30:40.419
- We got a whole sky to sleep under.

30:40.419 --> 30:42.086
- But we got a base.

30:45.355 --> 30:47.817
- What if there's a totem out here?

30:47.817 --> 30:48.650
- Exactly.

30:49.633 --> 30:51.966
We got a base with lanterns.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.537
Oh!

31:03.537 --> 31:05.601
- What's with the rocks?

31:05.601 --> 31:07.542
- Just, you know,

31:07.542 --> 31:10.489
in case I need to use them.

31:10.489 --> 31:13.539
Way better than a dumb campfire right?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.553
- It's something.

31:15.553 --> 31:18.805
Search party probably won't see.

31:18.805 --> 31:22.012
- We'll leave it on while we sleep.

31:22.012 --> 31:23.297
Just in case.

31:23.297 --> 31:25.464
- In case of what?

31:30.020 --> 31:31.933
- It'll be on all night.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.071
If anything comes, it'll be on tape.

31:35.071 --> 31:36.775
- You mean film?

31:36.775 --> 31:37.805
- I mean digital.

31:37.805 --> 31:40.944
It's kind of like a security camera.

33:08.472 --> 33:09.305
Get up.

33:10.560 --> 33:12.393
- Foxes are nocturnal.

33:14.302 --> 33:17.250
- What do you think it saw?

33:17.250 --> 33:19.417
- Lots of snoring.

33:24.951 --> 33:26.875
- It'll be on all night.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.909
If anything comes, it'll be on tape.

33:29.909 --> 33:31.409
- You mean film?

33:31.409 --> 33:32.604
- I mean digital.

33:32.604 --> 33:33.873
It's kind of like a security.

33:33.873 --> 33:35.206
This is awesome.

33:46.842 --> 33:47.675
Wait.

33:48.576 --> 33:49.493
It stopped.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.156
- I know, keep going.

33:52.156 --> 33:54.239
- No, I mean, that's all.

34:04.675 --> 34:05.692
- What was that?

34:05.692 --> 34:07.525
- A bird, a mega bird.

34:09.429 --> 34:10.512
Maybe an elk.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.489
- What's that totem supposed to look like?

34:14.489 --> 34:16.484
- That's hokey camp stuff.

34:16.484 --> 34:17.317
- Right.

34:18.371 --> 34:21.797
- Okay, so I don't know what it is now,

34:21.797 --> 34:24.880
but I will, and I'm gonna capture it.

34:31.393 --> 34:35.257
And we're using the
marshmallows as bait of course.

34:35.257 --> 34:39.434
- But all we have left
to eat is marshmallows.

34:39.434 --> 34:41.458
- We can eat herbs and
spices from the woods.

34:41.458 --> 34:42.946
- Or we could go back.

34:42.946 --> 34:45.313
Safety in numbers, you know?

34:45.313 --> 34:47.463
I'll even sleep in the thermos.

34:47.463 --> 34:50.713
- And miss the discovery of a lifetime?

34:52.958 --> 34:56.569
How big do you figure this thing is?

34:56.569 --> 34:58.784
- Probably average.

34:58.784 --> 35:00.737
- Average to what?

35:00.737 --> 35:02.487
- Spirit type things.

35:04.329 --> 35:07.052
- I plan to make it as big as a deer.

35:07.052 --> 35:07.969
Small deer.

35:09.180 --> 35:12.039
- It had the phone way up by the roof.

35:12.039 --> 35:15.789
- You're right, better
add some pokey sticks.

35:20.054 --> 35:22.455
- You know, the Native Americans honored

35:22.455 --> 35:24.832
their spirits and deities.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.836
They respected them.

35:26.836 --> 35:27.803
- You have to be pretty crazy

35:27.803 --> 35:29.502
to believe in that kind of stuff.

35:29.502 --> 35:32.752
Come on, help me with the marshmallows.

35:34.745 --> 35:39.213
If the Native Americans had
all those spirits and stuff,

35:39.213 --> 35:40.358
where did they go?

35:40.358 --> 35:41.581
- Maybe they knew you were coming

35:41.581 --> 35:43.998
and took an early retirement.

35:46.094 --> 35:48.329
- Why can't the scientists find them?

35:48.329 --> 35:52.912
- I don't think scientists
know about the marshmallows.

35:58.910 --> 36:01.077
What's this tied here for?

36:02.443 --> 36:06.860
- It'll sound and set off
an alarm and seal its fate.

36:09.634 --> 36:10.467
Well?

36:12.501 --> 36:14.501
- I foresee no problems.

36:16.892 --> 36:20.069
Maybe it can't smell the bait.

36:20.069 --> 36:21.638
- Maybe it smells us.

36:25.836 --> 36:27.253
- And I'm hungry.

36:33.279 --> 36:36.529
I don't know if fish like marshmallows.

36:37.517 --> 36:39.793
- We should start hunting.

36:39.793 --> 36:41.912
I have a knack with traps.

36:41.912 --> 36:42.745
- Clearly.

36:51.754 --> 36:54.009
- Do you really believe
something's out there?

36:54.009 --> 36:54.842
- What?

36:54.842 --> 36:56.555
In the forest?

36:56.555 --> 36:57.805
- The universe.

37:00.154 --> 37:03.904
What could be out there
in a big empty space?

37:05.462 --> 37:08.465
- I'm not sure it's that far away.

37:08.465 --> 37:10.063
- I mean, how ridiculous to think

37:10.063 --> 37:12.740
that some invisible good
could be floating around

37:12.740 --> 37:14.744
and patrolling things.

37:14.744 --> 37:17.911
It certainly doesn't help me out much.

37:19.173 --> 37:22.756
- I guess it depends
on how you see things.

37:26.970 --> 37:28.838
You hear that?

37:28.838 --> 37:31.629
- Yeah, it's bugs and stuff.

37:31.629 --> 37:32.462
Come on.

37:34.238 --> 37:36.405
- No, it's something else.

37:40.368 --> 37:41.201
It's the

37:43.593 --> 37:46.352
defacer!

37:46.352 --> 37:48.019
You've been defaced!

37:49.429 --> 37:50.262
- Give it back!

37:50.262 --> 37:51.095
- No!

38:07.032 --> 38:08.992
- Do you think
they know I'm gone?

38:08.992 --> 38:11.909
- They're probably worried.

38:13.131 --> 38:15.964
- Those kids didn't sound worried.

38:18.694 --> 38:21.861
- Your parents
might send a search party.

38:21.861 --> 38:23.596
- I'll keep moving.

38:23.596 --> 38:25.251
- How far are you going to go?

38:25.251 --> 38:26.675
Another city?

38:26.675 --> 38:27.782
Another country?

38:27.782 --> 38:28.615
The moon?

38:38.450 --> 38:42.465
♪ Soar up honey ♪

38:42.465 --> 38:45.997
♪ The moon is not too far ♪

38:45.997 --> 38:49.560
♪ And the stars not out of reach ♪

38:49.560 --> 38:52.689
♪ Take a step ♪

38:52.689 --> 38:55.689
♪ And reach the sky ♪

39:29.760 --> 39:30.593
Felix.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.041
Hey, Felix!

39:42.041 --> 39:44.708
We need to get back to the base!

40:19.978 --> 40:21.228
- Chubby bunny?

40:23.984 --> 40:25.703
- Are you kidding me right now?

40:25.703 --> 40:26.691
You're not even smart enough

40:26.691 --> 40:28.478
to not set off a trap.

40:28.478 --> 40:30.036
How long have I known you?

40:30.036 --> 40:30.971
Years.

40:30.971 --> 40:32.511
That's my whole life.

40:32.511 --> 40:33.877
Sly as a fox.

40:33.877 --> 40:35.724
Crazy like a fox.

40:35.724 --> 40:40.293
I'm gonna go ahead and add
treacherous like a fox.

41:10.030 --> 41:10.927
Monster!

41:10.927 --> 41:11.760
Run!

41:12.609 --> 41:13.442
Run!

41:25.721 --> 41:27.202
See it?

41:27.202 --> 41:29.128
- I thought you were trying to catch it?

41:29.128 --> 41:33.961
- That was before it was all
goggly eyed and big and real.

41:38.290 --> 41:41.411
- So, do you wanna run away?

41:41.411 --> 41:42.367
- I wanted to catch it

41:42.367 --> 41:44.914
so I didn't have to run away.

41:44.914 --> 41:46.215
- Then go talk to it.

41:46.215 --> 41:48.120
- You go talk to it.

41:48.120 --> 41:49.537
- I'll be nearby.

41:54.709 --> 41:58.709
- Okay, if I hoot like
an owl that's our signal.

42:02.580 --> 42:04.447
For our plan.

42:04.447 --> 42:06.352
- What plan?

42:06.352 --> 42:08.019
- I'm working on it.

42:09.481 --> 42:10.314
- Okay.

42:11.516 --> 42:13.183
I'll go draw it out.

42:22.020 --> 42:22.853
Come out.

42:26.728 --> 42:28.859
I meant that in a, come out

42:28.859 --> 42:31.936
and let's have a nice chat sort of way.

42:31.936 --> 42:35.353
Not as a come out and eat me sort of way.

42:52.180 --> 42:54.347
Hello there little friend.

43:10.231 --> 43:13.564
- Hey, stop fraternizing with the enemy.

43:44.932 --> 43:45.765
Hey.

43:49.110 --> 43:49.943
Wait.

44:19.260 --> 44:20.093
Gotcha!

44:45.114 --> 44:46.531
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:55.412 --> 44:56.245
Ow.

44:58.769 --> 44:59.602
- Ow.

45:01.542 --> 45:04.323
- Way to stick to the plan.

45:04.323 --> 45:06.993
- Was that the plan flying pass?

45:06.993 --> 45:08.660
It looked wonderful.

45:27.574 --> 45:29.689
- Let's regroup.

45:29.689 --> 45:32.512
Okay, first of all, those bugs.

45:32.512 --> 45:33.345
- Sprites.

45:34.184 --> 45:37.121
- Okay, how do we know they're okay?

45:37.121 --> 45:39.748
They're friends with that monster.

45:39.748 --> 45:42.998
- It doesn't seem that monstrous to me.

45:45.198 --> 45:48.800
- It didn't mess up my pokey stick.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.368
- Have you considered inviting it?

45:51.368 --> 45:52.285
- Oh right.

45:53.632 --> 45:55.874
I'll just ask it to tea.

45:58.386 --> 46:00.303
- We tried it your way,

46:01.217 --> 46:03.884
how about trying it another way?

46:05.124 --> 46:06.207
- Not a trap.

46:08.909 --> 46:11.074
Maybe some place it likes.

46:11.074 --> 46:12.824
- Some place special.

46:36.155 --> 46:39.321
- I never quite
got the white rocks thing.

46:39.321 --> 46:41.321
- More inviting.

46:52.556 --> 46:55.472
- Well, to have a friend,
you have to be a friend.

46:55.472 --> 46:56.639
Mom said that.

46:59.781 --> 47:03.781
I don't know whether to
be excited or terrified.

47:05.647 --> 47:07.480
- Maybe both are okay.

47:17.384 --> 47:20.580
- Do you think I scared it away?

47:20.580 --> 47:22.402
- I don't know.

47:22.402 --> 47:24.319
You did try to trap it.

47:26.895 --> 47:27.728
- Yeah.

47:31.265 --> 47:32.941
- You know,

47:32.941 --> 47:36.349
the Who Knows is an unusual place.

47:36.349 --> 47:40.131
A little magical, a little dangerous.

47:40.131 --> 47:41.922
Most people don't even look for it

47:41.922 --> 47:43.755
but you're still here.

47:46.362 --> 47:47.515
- What do you think would happen

47:47.515 --> 47:49.473
if I brought somebody else out here?

47:49.473 --> 47:51.056
- To the Who Knows?

47:54.794 --> 47:55.711
- Like dad.

47:56.612 --> 47:57.445
Or mom.

48:00.785 --> 48:02.118
Or even Chester.

48:04.072 --> 48:05.405
- Maybe nothing.

48:07.540 --> 48:10.040
But then, maybe something too.

48:56.769 --> 49:00.519
- I've never even imagined
anything like you.

49:59.583 --> 50:01.125
- Come on, off into the Who Knows!

50:02.221 --> 50:03.804
- Wait up!

♪ She was wise ♪

50:22.384 --> 50:23.805
♪ Beyond all others ♪

50:54.324 --> 50:55.157

- Felix.

51:05.124 --> 51:05.957
Felix!

51:07.019 --> 51:08.618
The rain and bugs will get in.

51:08.618 --> 51:10.608
- Out here, I don't think we need

51:10.608 --> 51:12.650
a home base anymore.

51:23.943 --> 51:25.776
- Pretty neat.

51:27.779 --> 51:30.236
- But it's not home base.

51:30.236 --> 51:31.962
- An improvement.

51:31.962 --> 51:35.629
We still have walls,
but now we have a view.

51:51.489 --> 51:52.822
- Neat.

52:17.734 --> 52:20.337
- It wants us to fly.

52:20.337 --> 52:21.619
- I don't know about foxes,

52:21.619 --> 52:24.286
but people are attached to dirt.

52:27.416 --> 52:29.785
- I'm sure these get inspected for safety.

52:29.785 --> 52:30.871
- Oh,

52:30.871 --> 52:31.704
sure.

52:54.464 --> 52:55.547
Is this real?

53:04.775 --> 53:06.546
Let's go see the camp.

53:06.546 --> 53:08.465
- We can do that?

53:08.465 --> 53:11.215
- Look at us, we can do anything.

53:12.187 --> 53:14.437
- That's what you wanna do?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.360
- Just to see how lame they are.

53:36.246 --> 53:37.525
Let's go.

53:37.525 --> 53:38.358
- Where?

53:39.199 --> 53:40.831
- Someplace cool.

53:40.831 --> 53:43.138
- You don't wanna do their owl dance?

53:43.138 --> 53:44.689
- Not even a little bit.

53:44.689 --> 53:46.050
We can go anywhere we want

53:46.050 --> 53:48.380
and I don't want it to be here.

53:48.380 --> 53:52.673
- We could check in on
home if we wanted to.

53:57.225 --> 54:00.975
I bet your mom's making
those chewy brownies.

54:03.214 --> 54:07.364
- I guess it wouldn't
hurt to check in on them.

54:07.364 --> 54:09.447
- Donald, come on!

54:21.097 --> 54:22.965
- Can't they tell we're up here?

54:22.965 --> 54:24.226
- Up this high?

54:24.226 --> 54:25.833
Not very big.

54:25.833 --> 54:28.166
We fit between your fingers.

54:29.446 --> 54:33.161
- Look at them, just peas in a pod.

54:33.161 --> 54:34.990
- We could say hi.

54:34.990 --> 54:36.404
- Yeah right.

54:36.404 --> 54:39.571
They've been waiting to get rid of me.

54:45.357 --> 54:47.190
Let's get out of here.

54:58.555 --> 55:00.317
I just got a great idea.

55:00.317 --> 55:01.375
- You're gonna call them?

55:01.375 --> 55:05.158
- No, we can do this flying
thing to keep exploring.

55:05.158 --> 55:06.276
- The forest?

55:06.276 --> 55:07.980
- And beyond.

55:07.980 --> 55:10.916
We can just keep floating and floating.

55:10.916 --> 55:13.661
- But we have to bring it back.

55:13.661 --> 55:15.076
It's the totem's.

55:15.076 --> 55:16.426
- We don't need the totem.

55:16.426 --> 55:19.375
- The totem's our friend now.

55:19.375 --> 55:20.958
- You're my friend.

55:23.202 --> 55:26.670
- It can't be just you and me forever.

55:26.670 --> 55:27.837
You know that.

55:28.855 --> 55:29.688
- Why not?

55:34.486 --> 55:38.319
I want things to go back
to the way they were.

55:39.350 --> 55:43.476
- Don't you think you're
missing something?

55:43.476 --> 55:45.976
- You sound just like 'em now.

55:48.686 --> 55:50.659
There's no one on my side except me.

55:50.659 --> 55:52.143
Just me.

55:52.143 --> 55:53.310
I'm all alone.

55:57.299 --> 55:58.132
Felix!

55:59.746 --> 56:00.579
Felix!

56:27.095 --> 56:27.928
Felix!

56:30.917 --> 56:32.667
Felix, are you there?

56:36.068 --> 56:37.659
I lost my friend!

56:37.659 --> 56:38.992
Please, help me!

56:45.804 --> 56:46.637
Felix!

56:47.779 --> 56:48.612
Felix!

57:01.140 --> 57:01.973
Felix?

57:22.816 --> 57:23.899
Chubby bunny.

57:54.587 --> 57:55.754
Hold on Felix!

57:57.759 --> 57:58.676
I'm coming!

58:05.253 --> 58:06.086
Oh!

58:08.719 --> 58:09.886
Got stuck huh?

58:11.914 --> 58:14.591
I couldn't even find the white rocks.

58:14.591 --> 58:19.251
You should've seen me
running all over the place.

58:19.251 --> 58:22.186
You got me really worried.

58:22.186 --> 58:24.603
I was actually really scared.

58:25.545 --> 58:26.378
For real.

58:28.329 --> 58:31.226
Hey, at least I found you.

58:31.226 --> 58:33.982
Just me, my friend Felix,

58:33.982 --> 58:36.565
having adventures in the woods.

58:37.610 --> 58:41.584
I know you didn't think
I'd find you, but I did.

58:41.584 --> 58:44.183
It was a really big tree,

58:44.183 --> 58:45.850
but I wasn't afraid.

58:50.730 --> 58:52.980
Did you get sick out there?

58:54.004 --> 58:56.914
We'll find all kinds of
trouble to get into tomorrow.

58:56.914 --> 58:59.414
Depends on what you're up for.

59:00.445 --> 59:01.445
What's that?

59:02.969 --> 59:04.171
Oh.

59:04.171 --> 59:06.588
I thought you said something.

59:07.839 --> 59:12.256
Come on, we might actually
catch something this time.

59:25.022 --> 59:25.855
Come on.

59:55.723 --> 59:56.973
He's not right.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:03.175
Please help me.

01:00:03.175 --> 01:00:04.008
Please!

01:00:10.683 --> 01:00:11.516
Hey, no!

01:00:41.825 --> 01:00:45.042
I'm sorry I always mess things up.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:47.981
Just bring back my friend, okay?

01:00:47.981 --> 01:00:50.148
I'll do anything you want.

01:00:54.827 --> 01:00:56.077
Please help me.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.789
It's you!

01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:19.622
- Mostly.

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.643
You're squishing my guts.

01:03:32.623 --> 01:03:34.437
- What's with them?

01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:35.270
- Oh.

01:03:36.119 --> 01:03:37.702
They're my friends.

01:03:39.968 --> 01:03:40.801
- I don't know if we're gonna have

01:03:40.801 --> 01:03:43.609
enough marshmallows for everyone.

01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:46.234
- They don't really eat marshmallows.

01:03:46.234 --> 01:03:48.114
- You can eat them.

01:03:48.114 --> 01:03:49.776
I'll find herbs and
berries from the woods.

01:03:49.776 --> 01:03:50.609
- Thomas--

01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:52.244
- And we can go back to
the camp if you want.

01:03:52.244 --> 01:03:54.411
It'll be just like before.

01:03:55.278 --> 01:03:58.278
Okay, we could do anything you like.

01:03:59.328 --> 01:04:00.745
We can stay here.

01:04:02.602 --> 01:04:03.977
- I don't think this is the sort of place

01:04:03.977 --> 01:04:05.977
you can stay in forever.

01:04:07.693 --> 01:04:10.026
- What is this place really?

01:04:11.469 --> 01:04:14.466
- You can't really
understand the Who Knows.

01:04:14.466 --> 01:04:17.268
'Cause then it's just The Knows.

01:04:17.268 --> 01:04:18.768
- Not even a hint?

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:22.246
- You'll know some day.

01:04:22.246 --> 01:04:24.663
You're already halfway there.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:31.057
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do without you.

01:04:31.057 --> 01:04:32.643
- You might feel lonely sometimes,

01:04:32.643 --> 01:04:33.476
but,

01:04:34.954 --> 01:04:37.121
you're never really alone.

01:04:40.744 --> 01:04:44.744
- I'm glad you get to
stay with the totem Felix.

01:04:46.785 --> 01:04:47.911
- You'll have even bigger adventures

01:04:47.911 --> 01:04:49.828
than these ones Thomas.

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:02.568
- Felix.

01:05:07.752 --> 01:05:10.072
You're my best friend.

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:24.486
Don't burn your cabin down.

01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:32.088
Mom!

01:06:33.891 --> 01:06:35.058
I'm over here!

01:06:40.438 --> 01:06:41.271
I'm here!

01:06:44.942 --> 01:06:45.775
I'm alive!

01:06:47.512 --> 01:06:48.345
I'm alone!

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:02.168
- Tom?

01:07:02.168 --> 01:07:03.001
- Mom?

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:18.557
Hey!

01:07:20.218 --> 01:07:21.357
I'm here!

01:07:22.286 --> 01:07:23.761
Mama!

01:07:23.761 --> 01:07:24.674
- Thomas!

01:07:24.674 --> 01:07:25.507
- Hey!

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:26.854
- Are you okay!

01:07:26.854 --> 01:07:28.043
Are you okay?

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.268
- Yes!

01:07:29.268 --> 01:07:31.212
- Stay there, stay!

01:07:31.212 --> 01:07:32.435
- Babe you good?

01:07:32.435 --> 01:07:33.268
Yeah?

01:07:39.185 --> 01:07:40.018
- You okay?

01:07:40.018 --> 01:07:40.851
You okay?

01:07:40.851 --> 01:07:42.184
You're not hurt?

01:07:47.403 --> 01:07:49.736
- 7285, code six.

01:07:55.193 --> 01:07:57.276
- Did you make that fire?

01:08:16.363 --> 01:08:18.026
- You cannot run away like that.

01:08:18.026 --> 01:08:19.508
- I know.

01:08:19.508 --> 01:08:21.300
- You could have starved bud.

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.883
- I had all those marshmallows.

01:08:24.872 --> 01:08:28.048
- You see what happens when
you go outside the white rocks?

01:08:28.048 --> 01:08:29.386
You get lost.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:30.466
That's why we have protocol.

01:08:30.466 --> 01:08:31.697
- And did you get lost or did you just

01:08:31.697 --> 01:08:33.957
go out there to wander?

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:37.011
- I wandered around til I
got lost enough to come back.

01:08:38.412 --> 01:08:40.260
- Lost is just lost.

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:41.252
- Yeah, sounds like you ain't never

01:08:41.252 --> 01:08:43.669
been lost in your whole life.

01:08:56.291 --> 01:08:59.064
- We thought you'd drowned or something.

01:08:59.064 --> 01:09:03.319
- I was on the other
side, in the Who Knows.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.639
- What's that?

01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:07.697
- It's a secret sort of thing.

01:09:07.697 --> 01:09:09.322
- What does that even mean?

01:09:09.322 --> 01:09:10.596
- Don't say it.

01:09:10.596 --> 01:09:14.264
If you say it, it won't
be a secret anymore.

01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:17.939
Awesome.

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:18.939
- Oh my god!

01:09:20.846 --> 01:09:22.513
He's back.

01:09:22.513 --> 01:09:24.018
And they were looking everywhere.

01:09:24.018 --> 01:09:26.094
How'd you even make it all the way over?

01:09:26.094 --> 01:09:28.926
- I'm Thomas, and this is for you.

01:09:32.245 --> 01:09:33.078
- Me?

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:34.892
- I got it for crossing the lake.

01:09:34.892 --> 01:09:37.916
- No one's ever crossed the lake before.

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:39.638
- Me and Felix crossed the lake.

01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:41.970
We had some real adventures.

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:44.924
- Where is Felix now?

01:09:44.924 --> 01:09:47.282
- He went right into the Who Knows.

01:09:47.282 --> 01:09:48.698
He's still there.

01:09:51.076 --> 01:09:51.908
- Felix.

01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:55.717
Felix the fox.

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:04.113
You're a crazy kid.

01:10:05.207 --> 01:10:07.575
I tell you about the time he broke my TV?

01:10:07.575 --> 01:10:10.608
He had a game controller
wrapped around the ceiling.

01:10:10.608 --> 01:10:12.706
He was swinging all over
the place like a monkey.
