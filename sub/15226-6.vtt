01:23.282 --> 01:25.884
Oh, no! No!

01:25.951 --> 01:27.218
Ah, why me?

01:27.286 --> 01:28.386
What's wrong, Tony?

01:28.453 --> 01:30.221
I've been called
                  for jury duty.

01:30.289 --> 01:32.056
Oh...
     Ah, you're very lucky.

01:32.124 --> 01:33.324
You're getting a chance
         to participate

01:33.392 --> 01:34.358
in the judicial system.

01:34.426 --> 01:35.559
It's really a privilege.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.895
Have you ever been called?

01:37.964 --> 01:40.165
Not so far.
                           Yeah.

01:40.232 --> 01:41.699
Here you go.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.935
(phone ringing)

01:44.036 --> 01:48.206
Yo...

01:48.273 --> 01:50.742
Alex, phone for you.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.543
Oh, thanks, Jim.

01:52.611 --> 01:54.479
Who is it?
Your father.

01:56.281 --> 01:57.882
I don't want to talk to him.

01:57.983 --> 02:00.752
He'll have to call you back.

02:02.255 --> 02:04.356
Are you anywhere near a phone?

02:09.195 --> 02:10.762
He says it's important.

02:10.829 --> 02:11.996
(mouthing words)

02:12.098 --> 02:13.398
You're not gonna
      talk to your father?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.199
Look, I'll, uh,
      I'll trade ya, okay?

02:15.267 --> 02:17.234
You talk to him
  and I'll do your jury duty.

02:17.236 --> 02:18.903
Oh, come on, Alex.

02:18.971 --> 02:20.905
I know you're not
close to your father,
          "Not close"?

02:20.973 --> 02:23.374
but don't you think this is...
   We've talked exactly once
     in the last 20 years.

02:23.442 --> 02:24.909
Why is he calling me now?

02:24.944 --> 02:28.746
Well, you know, some people
  yakkety-yakkety-yakkety-yak.

02:30.349 --> 02:32.250
Come on, pick up that phone.
      No, no, no, no, no,
        Elaine. Elaine.

02:32.318 --> 02:34.085
Right now,
it's the first step.
      I don't want to talk

02:34.187 --> 02:35.219
to the guy!
Give me this. Give me this.

02:35.287 --> 02:36.320
Elaine, please.
     Here. Alex.

02:38.891 --> 02:41.392
Hello?

02:41.460 --> 02:43.260
Yeah.

02:45.264 --> 02:47.231
So, what's goin' on?

02:48.300 --> 02:49.968
Come on, what'd I miss?

02:50.035 --> 02:51.202
Come on, come on,

02:51.269 --> 02:53.838
what's new in the always
       fascinating world

02:53.906 --> 02:56.708
of my drivers?

02:56.775 --> 02:58.543
Why should we tell you?

02:58.611 --> 02:59.911
None of your business, Louie.

02:59.945 --> 03:02.313
Alex got a call from his father.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.483
Hey, what the heck?

03:09.255 --> 03:11.055
Tony's got jury duty.

03:11.123 --> 03:12.924
Oh...

03:14.760 --> 03:16.627
Well, the law says

03:16.695 --> 03:19.597
"everyone's entitled
to a jury of their peers."

03:19.665 --> 03:21.566
Who are they tryin',
a pinhead?

03:23.302 --> 03:26.704
Ha-ha-ha, Louie.

03:26.772 --> 03:28.206
I give the kid this--

03:28.274 --> 03:31.142
he's never at a loss
for a comeback.

03:31.210 --> 03:35.713
Boy, can you imagine
being some poor defendant?

03:35.781 --> 03:40.318
You're caught in a web
  of circumstantial evidence.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.752
You've got all your hopes

03:41.820 --> 03:45.156
pinned on an incredibly
      complicated defense.

03:45.223 --> 03:47.758
You glance over at the jury box

03:47.826 --> 03:50.195
and there's Banta
     playin' with his lips.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.475
Oh. Are you okay?

04:04.576 --> 04:05.744
Yeah, I guess so.

04:05.811 --> 04:07.812
He wants to take me to lunch.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.081
Oh.
 He said he's coming over here
       in a few minutes.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.517
Well, well, did he say
what's on his mind?

04:12.584 --> 04:14.953
Yeah, only that we've been
  strangers for so many years,

04:15.020 --> 04:17.055
he figures it's time
    we became friends again.
Good.

04:17.123 --> 04:19.824
Sounds like a pretty nice
          fella to me.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.729
Who are we talkin' about?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.297
Alex's father, Jim.

04:26.399 --> 04:27.965
Oh, oh, uh, right, right.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.200
ALEX:
                            Jim.

04:29.301 --> 04:31.669
Jim, he walked out on the family
        when I was a kid

04:31.737 --> 04:32.937
and I haven't seen him since,

04:33.005 --> 04:34.606
except that one time
  when he was in the hospital.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.040
What, is he in town
          on business?

04:36.108 --> 04:38.443
No, no, no,
       he lives here now.
Since when?

04:38.511 --> 04:41.745
1974.

04:41.814 --> 04:45.049
And you haven't seen him
       in all that time?
           Look, Elaine, Elaine,

04:45.151 --> 04:47.885
just leave me alone--
    look, I'm entitled to resent
       what he did to my mother.

04:47.953 --> 04:50.355
Your mother?!
    My God, who is this man?

04:54.126 --> 04:56.695
He's always been
   a compulsive ladies' man.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.063
And a real charmer,
too, by the way.

04:59.131 --> 05:00.898
I mean, that,
that was his curse.

05:00.966 --> 05:03.067
You know, every woman he saw
became a challenge to him.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.669
Okay, Alex, but, you know,

05:04.736 --> 05:07.404
time presumably has taken care
     of that little habit.

05:07.439 --> 05:10.875
Yeah.
     He's probably just a sweet,
             little old man now.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.110
Oh, big deal. What am I gonna do
 with a sweet, little old man?

05:13.178 --> 05:14.379
I mean, what are
      we gonna talk about?

05:14.447 --> 05:15.747
Oh, God, I hate it.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.915
It's always so awkward
     when we get together.

05:17.983 --> 05:19.884
We don't know
 whether to shake hands or hug.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.953
We end up standing
   and staring at each other.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.187
Look, whatever you do,

05:23.255 --> 05:24.555
don't make a big deal
       out of this, okay?

05:24.623 --> 05:26.224
Just don't anybody
        make a big fuss.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.159
Oh, God, here he comes now.

05:28.227 --> 05:29.093
Look, just cool it, all right?

05:29.161 --> 05:30.428
Just cool it.

05:43.909 --> 05:45.243
Hello.

05:46.878 --> 05:49.046
Hi, Joe.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.452
(sighs)

05:54.587 --> 05:56.320
Why don't you
       just get up and...

05:56.389 --> 05:59.090
Elaine, Elaine, stop.
            Don't do this to me.

06:03.195 --> 06:05.163
You push a girl like that away?

06:09.034 --> 06:10.735
You're still mad at me?

06:10.836 --> 06:12.403
Look, we'll talk later, okay?

06:12.471 --> 06:14.572
Um, uh, uh,
        this is Elaine.

06:14.606 --> 06:16.808
This is Tony.
                    This is Jim.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.843
This is Joe Reiger.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.752
That's for all the sons
          in the world

06:27.819 --> 06:29.721
who never hugged their fathers.

06:31.156 --> 06:33.424
This is the one I talked to
    on the phone, isn't it?

06:39.397 --> 06:40.931
Nice seeing
you again, Alex.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.633
Been such a long time.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.235
It sure has.

06:44.303 --> 06:45.836
Running around
       with other women,

06:45.904 --> 06:47.838
leaving your mother
        was inexcusable.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.440
I wasn't good
as a husband,

06:49.507 --> 06:51.642
I wasn't good as a father,
but at least I was

06:51.743 --> 06:53.778
a good enough
human being to realize

06:53.846 --> 06:56.848
what a bad influence
I was and simply leave.

06:56.915 --> 06:58.850
Yeah, and never
                    send a dime.

06:58.917 --> 07:00.518
I didn't say "perfect,"
I said "good."

07:02.621 --> 07:04.421
For Heaven sake, Alex,
        I'm an old man.

07:04.489 --> 07:06.691
I'm not saying we can
   be a close father and son.

07:06.758 --> 07:08.192
I'm not saying
       we can be friends.

07:08.259 --> 07:10.260
I'm just saying
  can't we be a couple of guys

07:10.328 --> 07:11.495
who don't bother each other?

07:15.233 --> 07:17.167
I guess so.
          I guess so.

07:17.235 --> 07:18.836
Okay, we can give it a shot.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.376
How come you never remarried?

07:25.478 --> 07:26.644
I don't know.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.012
I guess it's kind
                 of hard to find

07:28.079 --> 07:29.514
the woman I'm looking for.

07:29.581 --> 07:31.148
What are you looking for?

07:31.183 --> 07:32.984
Well...

07:34.720 --> 07:37.154
Someone who's interested
     in the world and, uh,

07:37.222 --> 07:38.890
doesn't take it too seriously.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.992
Someone who's not afraid to ask
      for what she wants.

07:41.059 --> 07:42.359
Excuse me,
               if you're through

07:42.427 --> 07:44.194
with that newspaper,
              could I borrow it?

07:44.262 --> 07:46.764
I want to see the <i>Doonesbury</i>
      cartoon on Alexander Haig.

07:46.832 --> 07:48.900
Yeah, sure.
                      Thank you.

07:49.001 --> 07:53.805
Uh, someone who's, uh,
         not afraid to be happy.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.607
(laughing)

07:56.675 --> 07:58.810
And someone
      who appreciates me.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.078
Thank you very much.
           That was nice of you.

08:04.049 --> 08:06.817
Alex.
                       Hmm?

08:10.856 --> 08:12.990
Oh, yeah,
        that's amazing.

08:13.058 --> 08:14.491
She's lovely.

08:14.559 --> 08:16.560
And you spotted her
    before I did, didn't ya?

08:16.629 --> 08:17.996
I saw her park her car.

08:18.063 --> 08:19.831
I memorized
her license plate.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.400
Excuse me.

08:22.468 --> 08:23.968
Joe! Joe,
cool it, will ya?

08:24.035 --> 08:26.470
I'm not going
       to embarrass you.

08:26.538 --> 08:29.474
Hi. This young man here

08:29.541 --> 08:31.742
was just describing
       the perfect woman,

08:31.810 --> 08:34.145
and he described you to a "T."

08:34.212 --> 08:35.913
Oh, come on.

08:36.014 --> 08:37.782
Joe, would you stop, please?

08:37.849 --> 08:39.751
Alex, there's nothing wrong
        with nice people

08:39.818 --> 08:41.284
acknowledging
      they're nice people.

08:41.352 --> 08:42.519
Well, that
                  was very nice.

08:44.456 --> 08:46.224
I think she likes you.

08:46.325 --> 08:47.658
Oh, please.

08:47.726 --> 08:50.427
What's your name,
          sweetheart?

08:50.529 --> 08:52.663
Karen.
"Karen."

08:52.731 --> 08:53.698
This is Alex.

08:53.765 --> 08:55.166
He's a wonderful person--

08:55.233 --> 08:57.902
kind, sensitive,
          very quiet.

08:57.969 --> 09:00.270
So without further ado,
           here he is

09:00.338 --> 09:02.139
to ask you what you're
           doing tomorrow night.

09:02.207 --> 09:03.941
Joe, please!

09:05.777 --> 09:06.978
(chuckles)

09:07.045 --> 09:08.212
What are you doing
        tomorrow night?

09:08.279 --> 09:11.415
Good, Alex.
         Joe, come on.

09:11.516 --> 09:13.584
I'm sorry, this must be
   very embarrassing for you.

09:13.652 --> 09:16.554
I mean, it's very embarrassing
      for me, believe me.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.557
Yeah, but as long
    as we've come this far,

09:19.624 --> 09:21.759
I'm not doing anything
        tomorrow night.

09:21.794 --> 09:24.261
Great (chuckles).

09:24.329 --> 09:25.562
Let's go out.

09:25.664 --> 09:27.365
Great. Where are we going?

09:29.435 --> 09:30.568
How about a movie?

09:30.636 --> 09:32.069
Oh, come on, Joe.

09:32.137 --> 09:33.738
That's not very
      imaginative of you.

09:33.806 --> 09:36.273
I mean, uh,
        I thought, uh...

09:36.341 --> 09:38.375
I know a great place
    in the Village for jazz.

09:38.410 --> 09:39.843
Oh, I love movies.

09:39.911 --> 09:42.079
Yeah? Well I hate jazz anyway.

09:42.147 --> 09:43.947
I was just foolishly
       trying to show you

09:44.015 --> 09:45.482
that I have a mind of my own.

09:45.550 --> 09:47.751
Now, here's Joe to make
  the arrangements; go ahead.

09:49.421 --> 09:51.823
Why don't you meet here
      at 8:00 for drinks?

09:51.857 --> 09:53.724
See you then.

09:53.826 --> 09:55.726
Okay.

10:00.432 --> 10:01.999
She's great, isn't she?

10:02.066 --> 10:04.202
Yeah, she really is.

10:04.269 --> 10:06.304
Hey, look, Joe, um,
                   this was, uh,

10:06.371 --> 10:08.605
this was a lot better than
      I even imagined, you know?

10:08.673 --> 10:10.107
Why don't we do
              it again sometime?

10:10.175 --> 10:12.109
It's been great.
                     Okay, soon.

10:12.177 --> 10:14.111
I'll pay the check.

10:16.748 --> 10:18.683
Tommy, here.

10:20.218 --> 10:21.919
Thank you.
                 Karen, I'll see
                  you right here

10:21.986 --> 10:23.120
tomorrow at 8:00.

10:23.188 --> 10:24.888
I'm looking forward
to it, Alex.
                      Me, too.

10:26.858 --> 10:29.794
Smooth, Reiger, smooth.

10:37.269 --> 10:40.871
Hi. I just wanted to say
I'm sorry if I made you, uh,

10:40.939 --> 10:42.707
feel uncomfortable
a few minutes ago.

10:42.775 --> 10:44.075
Oh, no, that's okay.

10:44.142 --> 10:46.744
I'm Joe McGinty.

10:50.449 --> 10:53.550
Sometimes I find it hard
     to resist being cute.

10:53.618 --> 10:54.952
I've tried to stop it.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.754
I even went
    to Cutie-Pies Anonymous.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.325
I must say, I do
           feel like dunking you
             in a cup of coffee.

11:01.392 --> 11:02.860
Oh...

11:02.927 --> 11:05.696
Well, it's nice
meeting you.

11:05.764 --> 11:08.132
Oh, by the way,

11:08.200 --> 11:10.901
uh, I see that you're
        a big fan of <i>Doonesbury.</i>

11:10.969 --> 11:12.903
If you like
                political humor,

11:12.971 --> 11:15.740
I think you'd be
         interested in a lecture

11:15.807 --> 11:17.941
down at the New School
             on Wednesday night:

11:18.009 --> 11:21.178
Art Buchwald,
                 Jules Pfeiffer,
                  Russell Baker.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.581
Why, that's fantastic.
         Maybe I'll go.

11:23.648 --> 11:25.315
Yeah, and maybe
      I'll see you there.

11:25.383 --> 11:27.484
Oh, no!

11:27.553 --> 11:30.554
I just realized you have
   to have tickets for that,

11:30.622 --> 11:32.389
and I think they're sold out.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.992
Oh...
                 Well, if you're
                that interested,

11:35.060 --> 11:37.127
uh, how about my tickets?

11:37.162 --> 11:39.463
Oh, no,
    I wouldn't think of it.

11:39.564 --> 11:42.633
Why don't you take just one?

11:44.002 --> 11:46.003
Now, wait a minute.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.172
I don't think
   that's a good idea either.

11:48.239 --> 11:49.974
I just made a date
       with your friend.

11:50.041 --> 11:51.843
I'd feel funny
      dating both of you.

11:53.879 --> 11:55.045
JOE:
                   First of all,

11:55.113 --> 11:56.646
this isn't really a date.

11:56.715 --> 11:59.917
Second of all, he's
           really not my friend.

11:59.984 --> 12:03.487
We've only seen each other
 two times in the last 20 years.

12:03.555 --> 12:06.090
So I'll leave a ticket
              at the box office.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.858
If you feel like coming,
            I'll meet you there.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.493
Well, then I don't suppose
there's any harm

12:09.561 --> 12:11.095
in dating both of you.
              Oh, of course not.

12:11.163 --> 12:12.963
It's the most natural
             thing in the world.

12:13.031 --> 12:16.867
Especially if one of us happens
      to be a harmless, old man.

12:16.935 --> 12:18.536
Which one of you is that?

12:18.603 --> 12:20.204
(chuckles)

12:20.272 --> 12:21.905
Then it's a date?

12:21.973 --> 12:24.175
(giggles):
      Okay.
                   I'll walk you
              to your blue Alpha

12:24.243 --> 12:26.343
with the brown seats.
           Why, you!

12:29.013 --> 12:30.948
(laughing)

12:33.152 --> 12:34.385
Hey, uh, what's
                so funny, Louie?

12:34.419 --> 12:38.222
Reiger's on thin ice,
and I'm a blow torch.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.000
Hey.

12:50.068 --> 12:53.070
Tony. I thought you'd
be at jury duty.

12:53.138 --> 12:54.738
Yeah, I was.

12:54.806 --> 12:58.309
Except, uh, I kept
             getting turned down
             by all the lawyers.

12:58.377 --> 13:00.811
And for the dumbest reasons,
   too, like, "Where do I live?"

13:00.913 --> 13:02.480
Oh, come on.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.682
They don't challenge you
  off a jury because of that.

13:04.749 --> 13:06.784
It's true.
 I filled out a questionnaire.

13:06.851 --> 13:08.920
It asked if I was a resident
       of New York City.

13:08.987 --> 13:10.021
I wrote "yes."

13:10.088 --> 13:11.388
Then it asked
      length of residence.

13:11.456 --> 13:13.423
I wrote "about 30 feet."

13:15.627 --> 13:19.463
Uh, maybe you measured wrong.

13:23.401 --> 13:25.202
(Alex whistling)

13:26.371 --> 13:27.705
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

13:27.839 --> 13:29.807
And meanwhile,
      while you were away,

13:29.874 --> 13:31.676
Alex got himself
       a new girlfriend.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.276
TONY:
Oh...
   Well, I wouldn't go so far

13:33.344 --> 13:34.712
as to say she was
        my "girlfriend."

13:34.779 --> 13:35.980
Yeah, who is she?
Who is she?

13:36.081 --> 13:37.714
She's a commercial artist
          named Karen.

13:37.782 --> 13:39.049
Woo-woo.
                 Yeah.

13:39.117 --> 13:41.452
You've been seeing a lot
            of her, haven't you?

13:41.519 --> 13:44.221
Well, I guess I have been
       monopolizing her.

13:44.256 --> 13:46.023
(hysterical laughter)

13:51.964 --> 13:53.531
Excuse me.

13:54.966 --> 13:57.067
Oh, I can't contain myself.

13:57.135 --> 13:59.069
Pay no attention.

14:00.305 --> 14:01.471
What is it, Louie?

14:01.539 --> 14:03.440
Something I said
      about me and Karen?

14:03.542 --> 14:05.642
(hysterical laughter)

14:11.316 --> 14:14.050
Certainly not.

14:14.152 --> 14:15.753
Oh, come on.

14:15.821 --> 14:17.120
If there's something
          so hilarious

14:17.188 --> 14:18.856
about me and Karen,
      I'd like to hear it.

14:18.957 --> 14:21.925
You don't understand, Reiger.

14:21.993 --> 14:24.261
This is special.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.697
It just can't be blurted.

14:28.433 --> 14:30.066
Well, suit yourself.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.537
It's like a fine wine.

14:33.604 --> 14:36.673
First, we should
                      uncork it.

14:36.808 --> 14:38.509
(pops)

14:38.577 --> 14:41.278
Then, we let it breathe.

14:41.346 --> 14:43.514
Then, we pour it.

14:43.581 --> 14:45.016
(mimics pouring)

14:46.150 --> 14:48.386
Then, we taste it.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.223
(gargles)

14:54.292 --> 14:56.560
Then, we swill it down.

14:56.627 --> 14:58.562
Can I have some
                  of that, boss?

15:01.199 --> 15:03.700
(indistinct)

15:06.004 --> 15:07.805
Was he making you curious?
                           Yeah.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.306
Well, he's not
       making me curious.

15:09.374 --> 15:11.308
Whatever's on his mind,
  I'm not the least bit curious.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.743
What the hell is on your mind?

15:12.811 --> 15:15.713
Well, I was just wondering

15:15.781 --> 15:20.083
whether you and this Karen woman
       have a, you know,

15:20.151 --> 15:22.886
"exclusive" relationship,

15:22.954 --> 15:27.224
or whether
     she dates other <i>guys?</i>

15:28.727 --> 15:30.894
Oh, what happened,
     what happened, Louie?

15:30.962 --> 15:32.963
You saw her
     with some other <i>guys?</i>

15:33.031 --> 15:37.234
Well, I happen to know
           she dates other <i>guys.</i>

15:37.301 --> 15:38.936
And it happens
             to be okay with me.

15:39.037 --> 15:41.438
Well, I don't mind
      tellin' you, Reiger,

15:41.506 --> 15:45.476
that takes some
       broad-minded guy.

15:45.543 --> 15:47.611
I take my hat off to ya.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.447
Come on, Louie, why are you
      going on like this?

15:50.515 --> 15:52.049
You keep acting
    like you know something

15:52.116 --> 15:53.483
that he doesn't,
         so what is it?

15:53.552 --> 15:56.554
Well, I mean...

15:56.621 --> 15:59.557
it takes some kinda guy

15:59.624 --> 16:01.892
to share a woman...

16:01.960 --> 16:04.762
with his own father.

16:10.569 --> 16:15.138
I was there the first time
   the old boy asked her out.

16:15.206 --> 16:18.108
I've seen them leave
       Mario's together.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.479
She's two-timing you
              with your old man.

16:22.547 --> 16:24.381
(hysterical laughter)

16:30.922 --> 16:32.690
Hey, Reiger,

16:32.758 --> 16:35.225
I'm sorry I had to be
      the one to tell you.

16:49.607 --> 16:50.808
Hi, Alex.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.509
Karen, before
this relationship

16:52.577 --> 16:54.978
goes one step further,
I have a question to ask you.

16:55.046 --> 16:56.379
I, uh, heard some gossip,

16:56.448 --> 16:58.315
uh, something some
little bat told me.

16:58.382 --> 17:01.251
You aren't by any chance
dating my father, are you?

17:01.352 --> 17:03.387
Dating your father?
Yeah?

17:03.455 --> 17:05.922
(laughing)

17:05.990 --> 17:08.559
Oh, now, Alex, that's absurd.

17:08.626 --> 17:09.925
Oh, God...

17:09.994 --> 17:11.494
Thank you.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.762
That's a relief.

17:12.830 --> 17:14.832
I mean, that would be ludicrous,
          wouldn't it?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.567
Oh...
                 Oh, now listen.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.669
I think I know
                  what happened.

17:18.736 --> 17:20.604
I have been seeing Joe,

17:20.638 --> 17:24.007
the guy that you were
        with here the other day.

17:24.075 --> 17:26.410
Someone obviously mistook
            him for your father.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.078
Yeah, me and my mother.

17:29.514 --> 17:31.181
Oh, no.

17:31.249 --> 17:33.216
Alex, what are you saying?

17:33.284 --> 17:35.619
(groaning)

17:35.687 --> 17:38.155
That munchkin I was having lunch
    here with the other day

17:38.222 --> 17:39.322
<i>is</i> my father!

17:39.357 --> 17:40.524
(gasps)

17:40.559 --> 17:42.960
Oh, now, come on, Karen,
it's not that bad.

17:43.027 --> 17:44.495
(screams)

17:44.563 --> 17:46.530
Karen, it's really
not that bad.

17:46.598 --> 17:48.098
At least we nipped it
in the bud

17:48.166 --> 17:49.800
before anything
embarrassing could happen.

17:51.102 --> 17:53.837
(moaning)

17:53.872 --> 17:55.805
I can't believe it!

17:55.874 --> 17:57.440
The man lied to me.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.109
Maybe he lied
               about everything.

17:59.177 --> 18:01.144
He seemed so dear
                      and sweet.

18:01.212 --> 18:02.313
(groans)

18:02.380 --> 18:04.315
Oh, Alex, I'm so sorry.

18:04.415 --> 18:06.083
If I had known,
       I wouldn't have...

18:06.785 --> 18:08.585
Oh...

18:08.653 --> 18:10.587
Karen, just tell me
one thing, will ya?

18:10.655 --> 18:12.922
I mean, what is it
about that guy?

18:12.991 --> 18:15.659
All his life he's had
   the most beautiful women.

18:15.727 --> 18:18.328
Women so beautiful,
    it took my breath away.

18:18.396 --> 18:20.430
Even thinking about them
      took my breath away.

18:20.498 --> 18:22.432
My mother thought I had asthma.

18:23.768 --> 18:25.402
I mean, I hated him
     for what he was doing,

18:25.470 --> 18:27.504
but at the same time,
  I was always in awe of him.

18:27.639 --> 18:28.872
What does he have?

18:28.940 --> 18:31.674
Well, he makes me laugh.

18:31.809 --> 18:33.043
Makes you laugh? How?

18:33.111 --> 18:35.078
Well, I don't know.

18:35.146 --> 18:37.213
Silly things.

18:37.281 --> 18:38.915
He imitates soup.

18:40.451 --> 18:41.685
Pardon me?

18:41.719 --> 18:43.854
Pea soup.

18:43.922 --> 18:47.124
Oh, I know what it is
           about Joe:

18:47.191 --> 18:49.292
he loves women.

18:49.427 --> 18:50.594
But I love women.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.830
No, no, no-no-no--
    I mean, he loves women.

18:53.898 --> 18:57.267
I-I've seen his eyes
       glisten with tears

18:57.334 --> 18:59.803
at the way I put on an earring.

18:59.871 --> 19:02.272
Oh, talking about him
       this way makes me

19:02.339 --> 19:04.407
almost wish he wasn't slime.

19:04.442 --> 19:05.875
Now wait a minute,

19:05.943 --> 19:07.744
that's my father
     you're talking about.

19:07.812 --> 19:09.146
Please continue.

19:09.214 --> 19:11.615
He's expecting me
                     for dinner.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.284
I am going to go over
            there-- No, I'm not.

19:14.351 --> 19:16.653
Why not? Go ahead. Do it.
               No, I'm not gonna
                  go over there.

19:16.721 --> 19:18.855
I'm gonna call him and
    give him a piece of my mind.

19:18.923 --> 19:19.957
No, wait a minute,
         wait a minute.

19:20.025 --> 19:21.291
Don't you think this
  should be done face-to-face?

19:21.359 --> 19:22.626
I don't want to go over there.

19:22.694 --> 19:23.894
I never want to see him again.

19:24.028 --> 19:26.730
No, I was thinking more
of my face and his face.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.165
For the first time in my life,

19:28.233 --> 19:30.533
I'm looking forward to seeing
      that father of mine.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.168
Uh, I'll call you later.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.212
(knocking on door)

19:47.919 --> 19:50.621
Joe, this is the lousiest thing
      I've ever heard of!

19:50.688 --> 19:52.489
This is the lousiest thing
       you've ever done,

19:52.557 --> 19:53.690
and that's saying something!

19:53.758 --> 19:55.425
You went behind
                        my back!

19:55.493 --> 19:57.594
You lied, it's the most
      despicable thing...

19:57.662 --> 19:59.029
This place is gorgeous.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.968
Thank you. My second
wife left me a bundle.

20:04.035 --> 20:06.203
I'd ask you to explain

20:06.271 --> 20:08.372
how you could do such
     a thing to Karen and to me,

20:08.440 --> 20:09.906
but I don't think in
    a million years you could...

20:09.975 --> 20:11.842
There's no fish
                   in this tank.

20:13.678 --> 20:15.112
I always wanted

20:15.179 --> 20:16.947
a fish tank;
       they're so pretty.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.849
But the fish
      are too much bother.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.050
Oh! You know, you're amazing!

20:21.118 --> 20:22.719
Did it ever occur to you

20:22.787 --> 20:24.621
how, how you could hurt
         Karen and me?

20:24.689 --> 20:26.490
Your second wife?

20:26.557 --> 20:28.024
You were married again?

20:28.126 --> 20:30.160
Yeah, 15 years ago.

20:30.228 --> 20:31.962
She was a doctor.

20:34.098 --> 20:36.633
This is your step-brother Mel.

20:36.701 --> 20:37.801
"Mel"?

20:37.835 --> 20:39.903
Now look, Joe, I didn't come
            here to talk to you.

20:39.971 --> 20:42.106
I came here to tell you
        something; I'm-a tell it
               to you right now.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.507
I don't respect
          anything you stand for

20:44.575 --> 20:45.942
and I never want
               to see you again.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.778
Good, I'm glad
you feel better.

20:48.913 --> 20:50.580
You were so upset
when you came in.

20:50.648 --> 20:52.849
Now that that's settled,
why don't you go

20:52.917 --> 20:54.785
because Karen is going
to be here any minute.

20:54.852 --> 20:56.219
No-no, no-no, no-no,
                  no, she's not.

20:56.287 --> 20:58.155
She doesn't want to have
   anything more to do with you.

20:58.189 --> 21:01.258
You mean I cooked
   my specialty for nothing?

21:01.325 --> 21:02.626
What's your specialty?

21:02.693 --> 21:03.894
Tuna casserole.

21:03.962 --> 21:05.862
That was Mom's specialty!

21:05.930 --> 21:07.097
Remember her?

21:07.131 --> 21:10.200
Yes. I got the recipe
           from her.

21:10.268 --> 21:11.801
I changed it a little.

21:11.869 --> 21:13.504
She always used a little
         too much salt.

21:13.571 --> 21:15.939
She used absolutely
   the right amount of salt!

21:16.006 --> 21:18.275
She used the perfect
 amount of salt, you lousy rat!

21:20.611 --> 21:21.879
It's a matter of taste.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.347
Why don't you sit down
         and have some?

21:23.414 --> 21:25.615
You're not even
bothered by the fact

21:25.683 --> 21:27.084
that I said I'm never
gonna see you again?

21:27.151 --> 21:28.652
What is it?
It's like hitting air.

21:28.719 --> 21:31.121
You're wrong, Alex, it would
    bother me a great deal.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.290
But it's not true.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.125
Why isn't it?
You have to see me.

21:35.193 --> 21:37.260
You have to listen
to me, 'cause I'm old.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.729
I'm going to die.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.831
Probably a long time before you.

21:40.899 --> 21:43.266
And anytime I call, you'll come,

21:43.334 --> 21:45.969
'cause it could be
  the last time you'll see me.

21:47.739 --> 21:50.774
Tonight could be
   the last time you see me.

21:54.312 --> 21:56.213
I don't like you, Joe.

21:56.280 --> 21:58.048
I like you.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.984
Call it love, call it blood,
         call it genes,

22:01.052 --> 22:04.420
but every ten years or so,
     I have got to see you.

22:06.591 --> 22:08.492
You're not
such a dull guy.

22:08.559 --> 22:10.627
You've still got
a little kick in you.

22:10.695 --> 22:13.263
And you're not bad
with the ladies,
from what I saw.

22:13.330 --> 22:16.166
Oh, yeah? Well, you're not
         so bad with 'em either,
           from what I've heard.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.601
Karen?

22:17.669 --> 22:19.036
I did the pea soup.

22:19.103 --> 22:20.537
What the hell is the "pea soup"?

22:20.605 --> 22:23.941
Thick pea soup
   coming to a furious boil.

22:43.594 --> 22:47.197
You can't do that
without getting
a pinch on the cheek.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.465
Women really like that?

22:48.532 --> 22:51.268
Drives 'em nuts.

22:51.336 --> 22:54.371
Listen, the only thing you can
      do right now, Alex,

22:54.439 --> 22:57.040
is kiss me on top of the head
     and sit down and eat.

22:57.108 --> 22:59.376
I'm not gonna kiss you
on top of the head.

22:59.444 --> 23:01.278
Your loss.

23:13.925 --> 23:15.292
(clanking)

23:43.921 --> 23:45.722
¶

23:57.602 --> 24:00.537
(theme song playing)

24:23.227 --> 24:24.895
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:24.963 --> 24:25.996
(man grumbling)
