WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.304
(Meredith)
SURGEONS CAN'T BE LAZY.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.005
THE RISKS ARE TOO GREAT.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.277
THAT ONE LOOKS LIKE
AN ISLET CELL.

00:06.277 --> 00:08.039
WHICH ONE?

00:08.039 --> 00:11.312
THAT ONE. IT'S ALL PUFFY
AND INSULIN PRODUCING.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.114
IT LOOKS LIKE A CLOUD.

00:13.114 --> 00:16.147
IT LOOKS LIKE AN ISLET CELL
OR MAYBE A BUFFALO.

00:16.147 --> 00:18.149
THE SECOND WE STOP
PUSHING OURSELVES,

00:18.149 --> 00:19.390
SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAPPENS,

00:19.390 --> 00:21.292
SOMETHING WE NEVER SEE COMING.

00:21.292 --> 00:24.055
I HAVE NO IMAGINATION,
MER.

00:24.055 --> 00:26.127
TEDDY SUCKED IT OUT OF ME.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.328
OH, LET'S NOT GO THERE.

00:27.328 --> 00:30.131
WE'RE JUST GONNA BELIEVE THAT
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.162
MM.

00:31.162 --> 00:32.403
WE'RE KEEPING THE FAITH.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.165
YEAH.

00:34.165 --> 00:36.367
SHE DID SAY THAT SHE HAD
SOMETHING GREAT FOR ME TODAY.

00:36.367 --> 00:38.169
WHAT ARE YOU ON?

00:38.169 --> 00:39.370
CABBAGE PATCH.

00:39.370 --> 00:42.313
O.B. STILL? YOU GOTTA GET OUT
OF THOSE PINK SCRUBS.

00:42.313 --> 00:43.374
WHY?

00:43.374 --> 00:45.176
BAILEY'S GOT ME BLACKBALLED
FROM EVERY SURGERY.

00:45.176 --> 00:46.317
BESIDES, IT'S QUIET.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.179
I GET TO WORK
ON THE TRIAL STUFF.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.381
I THOUGHT BAILEY TOLD YOU TO
STAY AWAY FROM THE TRIAL STUFF.

00:50.381 --> 00:52.153
I KNOW,
BUT I JUST CAN'T HELP IT

00:52.153 --> 00:54.155
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
I'M THIS CLOSE TO--

00:54.155 --> 00:55.186
(both) HEY!

00:55.186 --> 00:56.427
THAT COULDA HIT US.
CAREFUL.

00:56.427 --> 00:58.259
NICE HUSTLE.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.060
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THIS IS JUST

01:00.060 --> 01:02.093
MORE AVOIDING
THINKING ABOUT ZOLA.

01:02.093 --> 01:03.264
DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.266
NO. I--WE'VE BUGGED JANET
TILL SHE'S SICK OF US,

01:05.266 --> 01:07.138
AND SHE DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW ANYTHING,

01:07.138 --> 01:09.069
SO WE JUST HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE COURT TO GIVE US

01:09.069 --> 01:10.401
A HEARING DATE,
AND WE'RE JUST...
KEEPING THE FAITH.

01:10.401 --> 01:12.103
KEEPING THE FAITH.

01:12.103 --> 01:13.344
(Owen) KAREV, THROW THE BALL!

01:13.344 --> 01:15.346
(indistinct shouting)

01:15.346 --> 01:17.378
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.110
AAH!
COME ON!

01:19.110 --> 01:20.181
ROBBINS,
DON'T BE AFRAID OF IT.

01:20.181 --> 01:23.083
WAIT. I--OH!
WELL, IT FLEW AT MY HEAD.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.455
(woman) NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.

01:24.455 --> 01:26.157
YOU LIKE THAT?

01:26.157 --> 01:27.318
(laughs)
I SAID NOT BAD.

01:27.318 --> 01:29.120
DON'T GO CRAZY.
UH-HUH.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.121
(laughs)

01:30.121 --> 01:32.092
(Derek) SLOAN.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.093
HEY, SLOAN.
YO!

01:33.093 --> 01:34.225
(whistles) FOCUS. HELLO?
OKAY.

01:34.225 --> 01:35.226
WHO IS THAT?

01:35.226 --> 01:38.098
(Arizona) OH, JULIA CANNER
OR KINNEY.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
SHE'S AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST
FROM SEATTLE PRES.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.232
MARK'S BEEN... SEEING HER.

01:41.232 --> 01:42.473
(laughs)
EVERY NIGHT THIS WEEK.

01:42.473 --> 01:44.305
YAY.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.307
ALL RIGHT, NICE THROW, ROBBINS.
THAT'S THE WAY.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.279
(Callie) HEY, WEBBER,
WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN HERE

01:48.279 --> 01:50.281
AND SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE?

01:50.281 --> 01:51.382
UH, LET ME FINISH
THE CHAPTER.

01:51.382 --> 01:53.244
I NEED MY ENERGY
FOR THE GAME.

01:53.244 --> 01:55.346
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
WE'LL NEED IT.

01:55.346 --> 01:57.117
MM-HMM.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.419
WHO'S UP?

01:58.419 --> 02:00.321
HEY, HUNT.

02:00.321 --> 02:01.492
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON IN.

02:01.492 --> 02:03.454
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA LET ME PITCH?
I'M A REALLY GOOD PITCHER.

02:03.454 --> 02:05.196
UH, WE'RE FINE.

02:05.196 --> 02:07.328
SHEPHERD THROWS AN UNBEATABLE
SCREWBALL, ALL RIGHT?

02:07.328 --> 02:09.160
NOW... (clears throat)
LITTLE GREY,

02:09.160 --> 02:10.231
LET'S GO.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.463
(indistinct conversations)

02:12.463 --> 02:13.464
(man) GO, LEXIE!

02:13.464 --> 02:15.506
DROP THE BAT.
GO, GO.

02:15.506 --> 02:17.408
RUN TO THIRD.
DON'T STOP. ALL RIGHT.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.270
COME ON, EVERYONE.
LOOK ALIVE.

02:19.270 --> 02:22.513
YANG, GREY, YOU--YOU COULD
AT LEAST STAND UP.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.245
(laughs)
HI, HONEY.

02:24.245 --> 02:25.376
(man) LOOKING GOOD,
CHIEF HUNT.

02:25.376 --> 02:26.517
HI, CHIEF MacDOUGALL.

02:26.517 --> 02:28.319
MAKE IT BRAD.

02:28.319 --> 02:31.151
I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU
OUT HERE, HUNT.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
OOH!
WE'VE HAD THIS FIELD
EVERY MORNING.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.485
IS THIS
YOUR FIRST PRACTICE?

02:34.485 --> 02:36.327
UH, NO. NO, NO.
WE'VE BEEN...

02:36.327 --> 02:38.229
OH. I WOULD'VE THOUGHT
IT WAS.

02:38.229 --> 02:40.431
KUDOS FOR PUTTING A TEAM
TOGETHER AT ALL THIS YEAR,

02:40.431 --> 02:42.393
WHAT WITH ALL THE UPHEAVAL
OVER AT SEATTLE GRACE.

02:42.393 --> 02:44.335
YEAH, WELL, WE'VE GOT
A LOT OF GOOD PLAYERS--

02:44.335 --> 02:47.268
WEBBER BEING OUSTED,
ALL THAT NASTY BUSINESS

02:47.268 --> 02:49.400
WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S TRIAL
BEING SHUT DOWN--

02:49.400 --> 02:52.203
NO WONDER THEY PUT
A TRAUMA GUY IN CHARGE.

02:52.203 --> 02:53.274
(chuckles)

02:53.274 --> 02:54.475
YOU MUST FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE JUST SCRAMBLING

02:54.475 --> 02:56.477
TO STOP THE HEMORRHAGING
OVER THERE.

02:56.477 --> 02:57.508
(laughs)

02:57.508 --> 02:59.380
WE GOT ANOTHER HALF-HOUR
OUT HERE OR SO,

02:59.380 --> 03:02.182
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA BE READY
TO KICK YOUR ASSES TOMORROW.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.355
OH, JUST A HALF-HOUR?

03:04.355 --> 03:06.287
IS THAT ALL YOU NEED?
(cell phone rings)

03:06.287 --> 03:07.558
(beeps)

03:07.558 --> 03:09.490
HUNT, I GOTTA GO.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.491
(Owen) WHAT?
LEXIE.

03:10.491 --> 03:11.492
(Lexie) YEAH.
WE GOT A CONSULT.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.364
OKAY.
NO. NO, WAIT. WE'RE--

03:13.364 --> 03:14.565
I GOTTA CHECK ON A SICK KID.
CAN I GET A RIDE?
LISTEN, NO--

03:14.565 --> 03:16.267
I GOTTA UPDATE THE BOARDS.
NO, NO.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.268
(Cristina) IS THAT IT?
(Owen) NO, WE'RE STILL--

03:17.268 --> 03:18.399
ARE WE DONE?
JUST--JUST WAIT...

03:18.399 --> 03:20.471
(Derek) HUSTLE.
EVERYONE. NO, NO.

03:20.471 --> 03:21.502
WHOA. LOOKS LIKE
YOUR HALF-HOUR'S UP.
WAIT.

03:21.502 --> 03:24.204
(blows whistle)

03:24.204 --> 03:25.276
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

03:25.276 --> 03:26.477
COME ON. LET'S DO IT.

03:26.477 --> 03:28.279
(indistinct conversations)

03:28.279 --> 03:29.480
ALL RIGHT.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.211
(man) GOT IT?

03:31.211 --> 03:32.343
(man) I GOT THIRD. I GOT THIRD.

03:32.343 --> 03:34.415
(Cristina)
YOU SAID "GREAT."

03:34.415 --> 03:35.546
IS IT A TRANSPLANT?

03:35.546 --> 03:37.418
OH, IS IT
A HETEROTOPIC TRANSPLANT?

03:37.418 --> 03:38.489
NO.

03:38.489 --> 03:40.491
BUT YOU SAID "GREAT."
IS IT--IS IT BIG?

03:40.491 --> 03:43.223
WELL, IT'LL PROBABLY
TAKE YOU ALL MORNING.

03:46.327 --> 03:48.429
MR. FELKER,
THIS IS DR. YANG.

03:48.429 --> 03:52.232
AND SHE WILL BE PERFORMING
YOUR ANGIOPLASTY.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.404
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:57.308 --> 03:58.569
(lowered voice)
ANY FIRST YEAR CAN DO THIS.

03:58.569 --> 04:01.241
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE
WORKING ON A HEART.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.343
(lowered voice)
YOU'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON

04:02.343 --> 04:04.375
PREVENTING MR. FELKER
FROM HAVING A HEART ATTACK.

04:04.375 --> 04:06.317
I MEAN, I THOUGHT I WAS
GONNA BE WORKING ON A HEART

04:06.317 --> 04:07.448
IN THE O.R.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.249
HEY.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.581
IS SOMEONE GONNA ROTO-ROOTER
MY VEINS OUT?

04:12.323 --> 04:13.384
(taps chart)

04:13.384 --> 04:15.486
MM-HMM.

04:15.486 --> 04:18.559
(beeping continues)

04:18.559 --> 04:19.630
SO I TYPED IT UP FOR YOU.

04:19.630 --> 04:21.292
UH, FIELDING POSITIONS,
BATTING ORDER--

04:21.292 --> 04:22.393
IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE.

04:22.393 --> 04:23.464
YOU'RE A GOOD
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.296
THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S NOT A COMPLIMENT.

04:25.296 --> 04:26.537
I THINK BEING CHIEF RESIDENT
HAS SET YOU BACK.

04:26.537 --> 04:30.270
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU GETTING
OFF THE SIDELINES MORE.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.472
(Callie) ONE, TWO, THREE.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.273
OKAY, WHAT DO WE HAVE?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.406
CARL SHATLER,
SANITATION WORKER, MID 30's.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.577
FELL OFF THE BACK
OF A GARBAGE TRUCK,

04:36.577 --> 04:38.409
THEN HIT BY A CAR
BACKING OUT OF A DRIVEWAY.

04:38.409 --> 04:40.351
OKAY, VITALS ARE STABLE
BUT HE HAS MULTIPLE CONTUSIONS,

04:40.351 --> 04:42.483
SCALP LAC,
AND OBVIOUS HAND INJURIES.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.485
OKAY, CARL?
CARL, I'M DR. HUNT.

04:44.485 --> 04:46.317
(groans)
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?

04:46.317 --> 04:47.418
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
(moans)

04:47.418 --> 04:49.420
G.C.S. 10, AND PUPILS
ARE EQUAL AND REACTIVE.

04:49.420 --> 04:52.563
I'M GONNA NEED THE PORTABLE
X-RAY AND ULTRASOUND.

04:52.563 --> 04:54.395
(April) RIGHT AWAY.

04:54.395 --> 04:55.666
OH, THIS HAND'S HAMBURGER.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.328
HE'S GONNA LOSE
SOME OF THIS.

04:57.328 --> 04:58.529
OH, GOD. NO!

04:58.529 --> 04:59.630
CALM DOWN.
NO!

04:59.630 --> 05:01.632
CALM DOWN. KEPNER,
WHERE IS THAT ULTRASOUND?

05:01.632 --> 05:03.634
(moaning)
GIVE US SOME ROOM HERE,
TORRES.

05:03.634 --> 05:05.406
OKAY, I JUST NEED
TO STABILIZE THE HAND,

05:05.406 --> 05:06.437
AND THEN I WILL--
I SAID, GIVE US SOME ROOM.

05:06.437 --> 05:07.638
THE HAND IS NOT
THE PRIORITY RIGHT NOW.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.640
FINE. PAGE ME
WHEN YOU NEED ME.

05:09.640 --> 05:11.412
MM-HMM.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.344
(trash can lid clatters)

05:13.344 --> 05:14.485
HEY, KAREV,
I NEED YOU TO SIGN THESE.

05:14.485 --> 05:15.646
WHAT IS IT?

05:15.646 --> 05:17.488
A-A SUBPOENA
FOR ZOLA'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

05:17.488 --> 05:18.689
THEY'RE TRANSFERRING HER CARE
TO SEATTLE PRES.

05:18.689 --> 05:21.321
WAIT. WHY?
WE'RE HER DOCTORS.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.353
WELL, IT'S
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST

05:22.353 --> 05:23.424
BECAUSE HER PROSPECTIVE PARENTS
WORK HERE.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.525
THAT'S GENIUS.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.626
FIRST THEY TAKE HER AWAY
FROM SHEPHERD AND GREY,

05:25.626 --> 05:26.697
NOW THEY WANT TO TAKE HER
AWAY FROM HER DOCTORS?

05:26.697 --> 05:28.328
WAIT, WAIT, THE FILE.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.329
YOU HAVE TO SIGN--

05:29.329 --> 05:30.330
DON'T WORRY. I GOT THIS.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.402
(sighs)

05:31.402 --> 05:32.563
(telephone rings)

05:32.563 --> 05:34.565
(elevator bell dings)

05:34.565 --> 05:36.567
LET'S SEE. THE PATIENT JUST
FLEW IN FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

05:36.567 --> 05:38.569
SHE HAS
A HYPOTHALAMIC HAMARTOMA.

05:38.569 --> 05:39.670
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

05:39.670 --> 05:41.612
H.H. TUMORS ARE SLOW-GROWING,
NONCANCEROUS.

05:41.612 --> 05:42.673
THEY SIT IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS--

05:42.673 --> 05:44.645
MS. BAYER,
CAN I HELP YOU?

05:44.645 --> 05:46.417
NO, IT'S BEST
IF I JUST HOLD HER.

05:46.417 --> 05:47.648
IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.719
HOW LONG
HAS SHE BEEN SEIZING?

05:48.719 --> 05:50.721
WELL, THIS IS
THE FOURTH ONE TODAY.

05:52.423 --> 05:53.624
AH.

05:53.624 --> 05:55.486
IT'S GETTING WORSE,

05:55.486 --> 05:57.488
SO PLEASE TELL ME
YOU CAN HELP HER.

05:57.488 --> 05:58.729
IT'S, UH, IT'S TRICKY.

05:58.729 --> 06:01.462
CHARISSA'S TUMOR IS ECCENTRIC.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.663
IT OFF TO ONE SIDE
MORE THAN THE OTHER.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.665
PROTOCOL IS
A SUBFRONTAL APPROACH

06:04.665 --> 06:07.438
FROM HERE,
BUT I'D NEVER GET IT ALL.

06:07.438 --> 06:09.440
WELL, THE SURGEON
IN SAN FRANCISCO SAID

06:09.440 --> 06:11.442
THAT EVEN IF YOU JUST GOT
A LITTLE BIT OF IT,

06:11.442 --> 06:12.673
THE SYMPTOMS WOULDN'T BE
AS BAD.

06:12.673 --> 06:15.576
FOR NOW,
UM, UNTIL IT GROWS BACK.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.748
WELL, WE'LL TAKE
ANY RELIEF THAT WE CAN GET.

06:17.748 --> 06:21.652
I KNOW THE RISKS,
AND I'VE DONE MY RESEARCH.

06:21.652 --> 06:23.714
AND YOU...

06:23.714 --> 06:26.557
YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL
ON 87% OF YOUR SURGERIES

06:26.557 --> 06:27.758
LAST YEAR.

06:27.758 --> 06:30.721
SO WE WANT THE SURGERY
AND WE WANT YOU TO DO IT.

06:33.464 --> 06:35.395
I'D LIKE TO TRY
SOMETHING ELSE.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.467
EXCUSE ME?

06:36.467 --> 06:38.599
I'D LIKE TO COME IN
FROM HERE,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.730
FROM ABOVE.

06:39.730 --> 06:41.532
I THINK I'D HAVE
A MUCH BETTER VISUALIZATION

06:41.532 --> 06:42.733
AND I THINK
I COULD GET IT ALL.

06:42.733 --> 06:45.476
BUT NONE OF
THE EIGHT OTHER NEUROSURGEONS

06:45.476 --> 06:47.538
WE TALKED TO
EVEN SUGGESTED THAT.

06:47.538 --> 06:50.481
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S
NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.785
WELL, WHAT ARE THE RISKS?

06:54.785 --> 06:57.748
UH, WELL, YOU'RE PASSING
BETWEEN TWO HEMISPHERES,

06:57.748 --> 06:59.690
SO THERE'S A GREATER RISK
OF INJURY,

06:59.690 --> 07:01.552
INCLUDING
SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS,

07:01.552 --> 07:04.525
UM, STROKE,
AND EVEN DEATH.

07:04.525 --> 07:06.527
NO.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.728
I CAN'T DO THAT.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.702
I UNDERSTAND.
I REALLY DO.

07:11.702 --> 07:15.536
A SUBFRONTAL APPROACH
IS A VERY STANDARD PROCEDURE.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.737
YOU COULD PROBABLY FIND
ANOTHER SURGEON

07:16.737 --> 07:18.509
WHO'S QUALIFIED TO DO THAT.

07:18.509 --> 07:20.571
CAN I SEE THE LIST
OF WHO YOU TALKED TO?

07:20.571 --> 07:22.643
UH... YES, BUT...

07:22.643 --> 07:24.475
I'D RATHER HAVE YOU.

07:24.475 --> 07:25.676
DR. SAMUELSON IS FANTASTIC.

07:25.676 --> 07:27.718
I DON'T THINK YOU COULD
DO BETTER THAN HIM.

07:27.718 --> 07:28.779
(rustles paper)
(sighs)

07:28.779 --> 07:30.551
IT WAS VERY NICE MEETING YOU,
MS. BAYER,

07:30.551 --> 07:31.822
AND I WISH YOU
THE BEST OF LUCK.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.505
SO WHY DID I JUST HAVE
AN IRATE MOTHER

07:54.505 --> 07:56.476
CLAIM THAT YOU REFUSE
TO SAVE THE LIFE

07:56.476 --> 07:57.678
OF HER TEENAGE DAUGHTER?

07:57.678 --> 07:59.550
IT WAS A CONSULT
FOR AN H.H. TUMOR.

07:59.550 --> 08:01.211
I TOLD HER THAT WITH
A TRANSCALLOSAL APPROACH,

08:01.211 --> 08:02.553
I THINK I COULD GET IT ALL.

08:02.553 --> 08:03.684
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO TAKE THE RISK.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.715
IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.517
SO DO IT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

08:06.517 --> 08:08.619
THERE ARE PLENTY OF SURGEONS
IN SAN FRANCISCO

08:08.619 --> 08:10.661
AS QUALIFIED AS I AM
TO DO THAT.

08:10.661 --> 08:12.623
BUT THEY WANT YOU.
THEY GOT ON A PLANE.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.224
I WON'T DO IT.
IT WILL GROW BACK.

08:14.224 --> 08:15.596
MAYBE IT WON'T.
MAYBE.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.227
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST WAIT
AND SEE AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

08:17.227 --> 08:18.769
YES.
NO. I'M NOT GONNA
DO THAT ANYMORE.

08:18.769 --> 08:21.802
I HAD A KID IN A CRIB
IN MY BEDROOM FOR A WHILE,

08:21.802 --> 08:24.535
AND SOCIAL SERVICES
TOOK HER AWAY.

08:24.535 --> 08:25.736
AND THE ONLY THING
THEY'RE GONNA SAY TO ME NOW

08:25.736 --> 08:27.738
IS THAT YOU GOTTA
WAIT AND SEE

08:27.738 --> 08:28.779
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.510
IT'S FRUSTRATING.
I GET THAT.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.583
I AMSICKOF HALF MEASURES.
NOT IN MY O.R.

08:32.583 --> 08:34.244
NOT TODAY. I CAN'T.

08:34.244 --> 08:35.515
I THINK YOU CAN.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.588
I THINK HER BEST SHOT
IS IN YOUR HANDS,

08:37.588 --> 08:39.590
AND SO DOES THAT MOTHER.

08:39.590 --> 08:40.791
WE DON'T SEND PEOPLE HOME,
DEREK.

08:40.791 --> 08:44.524
IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE.
IT'S NOT WHO YOU ARE.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.256
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.530
DON'T SEND HER BACK.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.531
SO THEN YOU'LL DO IT?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.733
NO.

08:52.733 --> 08:56.637
I'M GONNA PROVE TO HER
MY WAY WILL WORK.

08:58.308 --> 09:01.742
(Teddy) SO BASICALLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

09:01.742 --> 09:06.276
THE DEVICE THAT YOU PUT IN HIM
IS DEFECTIVE.

09:06.276 --> 09:07.648
I'M SAYING,

09:07.648 --> 09:09.750
YOU--YOU GOT ONE OF
THE ORIGINAL DEVICES,

09:09.750 --> 09:12.623
AND THERE ARE
SOME KINKS TO WORK OUT.

09:12.623 --> 09:13.824
SO IT'S A COLLECTIBLE.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.826
WHEN I DIE, YOU SHOULD
JUST PUT IT ON eBay.

09:15.826 --> 09:18.328
FOR NOW, THE ONLY ISSUE

09:18.328 --> 09:20.290
IS THAT YOU HAVE TO RESUME
DAILY TESTING--

09:20.290 --> 09:22.292
BECAUSE HE COULD
BECOME DIABETIC AGAIN.

09:22.292 --> 09:23.634
IS THAT RIGHT?

09:23.634 --> 09:26.637
BECAUSE THE DEVICE
IS BASICALLY A HUGE FAILURE.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.739
NO, IT'S--IT'S GOT
SOME PROBLEMS.

09:28.739 --> 09:29.800
WHICH SHE IS TRYING TO FIX.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.602
THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT
A TRIAL.

09:31.602 --> 09:32.803
HEY, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

09:32.803 --> 09:34.645
WE FIGURED OUT
WHAT WAS WRONG.

09:34.645 --> 09:38.308
AND WE'RE TRYING HARD
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIX IT.

09:38.308 --> 09:39.650
LOOK, I-I KNEW THE RISKS

09:39.650 --> 09:41.682
WHEN THEY PUT
THIS TIDDLYWINK IN ME.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.785
PLUS, ALL THE CHECKUPS MEAN
I GET TO SEE YOU MORE.

09:46.857 --> 09:48.789
DON'T WORRY.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.721
YOU'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.899
OKAY, MR. FELKER. I'M GOING TO
INSERT THE CATHETER NOW.

09:58.899 --> 10:01.902
I'LL GUIDE IT UP TO THE ARTERIES
SURROUNDING YOUR HEART.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.735
GET READY TO SEE A LOT
OF CHEESEBURGERS AND FRIES.

10:04.735 --> 10:06.336
I WORK IN FAST FOOD.

10:06.336 --> 10:07.838
OH.

10:07.838 --> 10:09.780
SO IS THIS ALL YOU DO
EVERY DAY,

10:09.780 --> 10:11.812
SUCK CRAP
OUT OF CLOGGED VEINS?

10:11.812 --> 10:13.814
ARTERIES.
THEY'RE CALLED ARTERIES.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.786
I'M MORE OF
A RENAISSANCE-TYPE GUY.

10:15.786 --> 10:16.917
I'M A MANAGER,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.819
BUT I HAVE TO KNOW
HOW TO WORK THE FRY MACHINE,

10:18.819 --> 10:20.691
MAN THE GRILL, MAKE SHAKES.

10:20.691 --> 10:22.622
HELL, WHEN EVERYONE ELSE
IS BUSY,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.655
I'M EVEN THE GUY
WHO MOPS OUT THE JOHN.

10:24.655 --> 10:26.727
OKAY, WE'RE GIVING YOU
A LITTLE MORE SEDATION NOW.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.399
I GUESS EVERYONE ELSE
IS BUSY, HUH?

10:29.399 --> 10:30.901
THEY GAVE YOU JOHN DUTY.

10:30.901 --> 10:35.365
(laughs)

10:35.365 --> 10:36.837
(sighs)

10:40.640 --> 10:42.843
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

10:42.843 --> 10:43.914
WOW. SOMEONE LOOKS LIKE
THEY GOT--

10:43.914 --> 10:45.716
THEY GOT WORSE NEWS
THAN US.

10:45.716 --> 10:46.847
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I'M CHEERED UP ALREADY.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.850
I MAY HAVE JUST LOST MY PITCHER
TO A BRAIN SURGERY.

10:49.850 --> 10:52.652
BUT--BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
I-I CAN PITCH.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.654
HONEY, YOU WERE
A PRO BALLPLAYER.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.826
COME ON. TELL HIM.
TELL HIM.

10:55.826 --> 10:56.857
TELL HIM I CAN PITCH.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.388
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER PITCH.

10:58.388 --> 10:59.860
YOU'RE A PRO BALLPLAYER?
(elevator bell dings)

10:59.860 --> 11:00.961
WELL, FORMER.
I'M A PRO SHIPPING CLERK NOW.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.432
CAN YOU PLAY TOMORROW?

11:02.432 --> 11:03.764
DOESN'T HE
HAVE TO WORK HERE?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.866
I-I-I WILL HIRE YOU NOW
AND FIRE YOU AFTER THE GAME.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.898
YOU ARE NOW
MY ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT.

11:07.898 --> 11:10.801
CAN'T I BE SOMETHING COOL,
LIKE A VASCULAR SURGEON OR--

11:10.801 --> 11:11.902
(laughs) YOU CAN BE
WHATEVER YOU WANT

11:11.902 --> 11:13.844
IF YOU HELP US BEAT
SEATTLE PRES.
(laughs)

11:13.844 --> 11:15.846
(elevator bell dings)
I CAN HELP YOU BEAT
SEATTLE PRES.

11:15.846 --> 11:17.908
I'M TELLING YOU,
I CAN PITCH.

11:17.908 --> 11:19.710
(clears throat)

11:19.710 --> 11:21.882
HEY, GREY, I WAS JUST IN
GIVING THE TYSON FAMILY

11:21.882 --> 11:23.413
AN UPDATE ON THEIR PREEMIE,

11:23.413 --> 11:24.785
AND THE MOM'S COMPLAINING
OF CHEST PAINS.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.986
ALREADY CALLED ALTMAN
FOR A CONSULT.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.818
OKAY, GREAT.

11:27.818 --> 11:29.890
UH, DID YOU--HAVE YOU
TALKED TO KAREV?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.691
ABOUT?

11:31.691 --> 11:33.894
WELL--WELL, THE COURT ASKED
FOR ZOLA'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

11:33.894 --> 11:34.995
WHY?

11:34.995 --> 11:36.466
WELL, IT'S PRO--
IT'S PROBABLY NOTHING.

11:36.466 --> 11:37.768
I MEAN, DON'T READ
ANYTHING INTO IT.

11:37.768 --> 11:39.770
I JUST--
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

11:39.770 --> 11:40.901
THANKS.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.833
MM. INTERACTIVE PROPERTIES
OF ISLET CELLS?

11:42.833 --> 11:44.704
IS--IS THAT BAILEY'S THING?

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
I'M WORKING WITH BAILEY
ON THIS.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.879
I THOUGHT BAILEY
WAS PISSED AT YOU.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.481
NO. NO, WE'RE GOOD.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.984
OKAY.GOOD, THEN.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.886
(sighs)

11:55.886 --> 11:57.848
(woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

11:57.848 --> 11:59.790
(indistinct conversations)

11:59.790 --> 12:01.952
(woman) NEXT IN LINE.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.797
HEY. UM, I'M TRYING
TO GET SOME INFORMATION

12:06.797 --> 12:08.728
ABOUT THIS ADOPTION CASE.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.030
THE NAME IS ZOLA--

12:10.030 --> 12:12.032
FAMILY SERVICES.
WHAT?

12:12.032 --> 12:13.463
REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

12:13.463 --> 12:15.005
CAN BE MADE IN WRITING
TO FAMILY SERVICES.

12:15.005 --> 12:16.937
UH, LOOK,
I'M HER DOCTOR.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.839
AND, UH, THEY SUBPOENAED
HER MEDICAL RECORDS--

12:18.839 --> 12:20.510
I CAN'T TAKE YOUR FILES.

12:20.510 --> 12:21.912
LOOK, I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

12:21.912 --> 12:23.944
I'M JUST--I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS ADOPTION.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.746
IT TAKES SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS
TO PROCESS REQUESTS.

12:26.746 --> 12:27.948
NEVER MIND.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.880
NEXT.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.021
WHERE DO I WRITE?
WHAT'S THE ADDRESS?

12:31.021 --> 12:32.823
THIS ADDRESS.

12:32.823 --> 12:35.886
OFFICE OF FAMILY COURT SERVICES,
FIFTH FLOOR.

12:35.886 --> 12:37.757
FIFTH FLOOR. THANKS.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
UH, SO C.T.'s NEGATIVE
FOR INTERNAL BLEEDING,

12:39.759 --> 12:41.031
SO CHIEF HUNT SAYS
MR. SHATLER'S ALL YOURS.

12:41.031 --> 12:42.833
OH, THAT'S SUPER.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.835
HEY, TELL CHIEF HUNT
I'M SO GRATEFUL

12:44.835 --> 12:46.036
HE GAVE ME THE GO-AHEAD.

12:46.036 --> 12:48.799
OKAY. W--
WAS THAT SARCASTIC?

12:48.799 --> 12:49.940
(elevator bell dings)

12:49.940 --> 12:51.041
(chuckles) SORRY.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.843
UM, HEY, IS THERE ANY CHANCE

12:52.843 --> 12:53.974
YOU NEED AN ASSIST
ON THAT HAND?

12:53.974 --> 12:55.045
I NEED MORE O.R. TIME.

12:55.045 --> 12:56.847
SURE.
GO SCHEDULE AN O.R.

12:56.847 --> 12:58.048
OH, AND, UH, WISH ME LUCK.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.850
I'M ABOUT TO TELL A GUY

12:59.850 --> 13:01.882
HIS CRAPPY DAY
JUST GOT CRAPPIER.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.884
(Callie) CONSIDERING
ALL YOU WENT THROUGH,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.886
YOU WERE LUCKY, REALLY.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.089
THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SETUP
FOR BAD NEWS.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.861
UH... (sighs deeply)

13:10.861 --> 13:12.863
SOME OF THE BONES IN YOUR HAND
WERE PULVERIZED.

13:12.863 --> 13:14.895
OH.
THERE WAS EXTENSIVE
NERVE AND TISSUE DAMAGE.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.027
I'LL KNOW MORE ONCE WE GET
IN THE O.R. AND CLEAN IT UP,

13:17.027 --> 13:20.000
BUT THERE'S A CHANCE YOU COULD
LOSE THESE TWO FINGERS.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.872
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S A SHOCK...

13:21.872 --> 13:23.073
DAMN IT.
BUT YOU SURVIVED
A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT--

13:23.073 --> 13:24.975
SON OF A--
WHOA. HOLY CRAP.
WHAT ARE YOU--

13:24.975 --> 13:27.037
UH, WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
OH, NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT A WEAPON.

13:27.037 --> 13:28.578
UM--
THAT--THAT'S A--

13:28.578 --> 13:29.579
A SPITSTICKER.

13:29.579 --> 13:30.881
I-I DO--

13:30.881 --> 13:33.013
I DO WOODCARVING,
UM, WOOD PRINTS.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.885
I, UH, I CARRY THIS STUFF
WITH ME

13:34.885 --> 13:36.086
'CAUSE I HAVE
A LOT OF DOWNTIME ON MY JOB.

13:36.086 --> 13:38.588
I...

13:38.588 --> 13:40.090
OKAY.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.052
UM, I'M SORRY.

13:42.052 --> 13:43.854
IT'S JUST, YOU KINDA...

13:43.854 --> 13:45.595
YEAH.
AND THAT SCARED THE HELL
OUTTA ME.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.898
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR MY PHONE
TO--TO CALL MY WIFE.

13:47.898 --> 13:49.059
OKAY. (chuckles)

13:49.059 --> 13:51.601
ARE YOU GONNA FREAK OUT IF
I STICK MY HAND IN HERE AGAIN?

13:51.601 --> 13:53.033
NO. (chuckles)

13:58.568 --> 14:00.040
WOW. THIS...

14:00.040 --> 14:02.572
THIS IS GORGEOUS.

14:02.572 --> 14:03.843
CAN I...

14:03.843 --> 14:04.915
YEAH.
DO YOU...

14:06.846 --> 14:07.918
WOW.

14:07.918 --> 14:08.979
DO YOU...

14:08.979 --> 14:10.120
DO YOU SELL THIS STUFF?

14:10.120 --> 14:11.151
NO, NO.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.852
COLLECTING GARBAGE
PAYS THE BILLS.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.884
THIS--

14:13.884 --> 14:15.125
THIS--THIS KEEPS ME SANE.

14:15.125 --> 14:16.586
MM.

14:16.586 --> 14:17.928
OR IT DID...

14:17.928 --> 14:20.060
TILL TODAY.

14:20.060 --> 14:22.632
(chuckles) YOU MIGHT
WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

14:22.632 --> 14:24.965
SHE'S GONNA BE
PRETTY UPSET.

14:26.897 --> 14:30.070
MAKE SURE YOU, UH, TELL HER
THAT I'M...

14:30.070 --> 14:32.602
I'M SOMETHING
OF AN ARTIST MYSELF.

14:32.602 --> 14:33.603
(chuckles)

14:33.603 --> 14:35.605
HOW ABOUT NOW? ANY LIGHTS?

14:35.605 --> 14:37.877
YEAH. SUPPLEMENTAL
MOTOR AREA.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.080
GREAT. I JUST PARALYZED
THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.953
SO SHE'S
COMPLETELY PARALYZED.

14:42.953 --> 14:44.154
WE HIT THE RIGHT SIDE
EARLIER.

14:44.154 --> 14:45.615
MM.

14:45.615 --> 14:48.158
ALL RIGHT.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.961
LET'S TRY ANOTHER ANGLE.

14:50.961 --> 14:52.022
DING.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.093
DAMN. WHAT WAS THAT?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.665
FORNIX. OOH, THROUGH
TO THE BASILAR.

14:55.665 --> 14:56.927
SO SHE'D BE, UH...

14:56.927 --> 14:59.169
MUTE, MEMORY LOSS,
BRAIN DEAD.

14:59.169 --> 15:00.670
HOW'S IT GOING?

15:00.670 --> 15:02.672
I JUST CAN'T FIND
A CLEAN APPROACH.

15:02.672 --> 15:04.975
LEXIE, SHUT DOWN
THE MONITOR.

15:04.975 --> 15:07.107
I GUESS I OWE THE MOM
A SURGERY.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.638
NO, NO, NO. NO, NOT YET.

15:08.638 --> 15:10.010
NOT YET. TRY IT AGAIN.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.982
ALL RIGHT, NOW YOU'RE
REALLY GETTING ON MY NERVES.

15:11.982 --> 15:14.014
I'M JUST PRACTICING
MY COACHING SKILLS.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.115
(chuckles)

15:15.115 --> 15:17.187
SERIOUSLY, SHEPHERD.
PICK UP THE DAMN PROBE.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.923
(blowing air rhythmically)

15:25.695 --> 15:27.197
ALL RIGHT.

15:27.197 --> 15:28.928
TURN IT BACK ON.

15:31.201 --> 15:32.202
DING.

15:32.202 --> 15:33.933
(sighs)

15:40.570 --> 15:42.672
OH. HEY.

15:42.672 --> 15:45.675
TEDDY GAVE ME
A MARATHON ANGIOPLASTY.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.677
HER "GREAT" THING
WAS A PLUMBING JOB.

15:47.677 --> 15:50.520
THEY'VE SUBPOENAED
ZOLA'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.651
WELL, THAT...

15:51.651 --> 15:53.653
THAT'S GOOD.
IT'S MOVEMENT.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.525
(beeping continues)

15:55.525 --> 15:56.686
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:56.686 --> 15:58.989
I'M GONNA E-MAIL JANET
AND SEE IF SHE KNOWS ANYTHING.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.432
WE'RE KEEPING THE FAITH,
RIGHT?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.634
DID I MENTION, I CAN'T CRACK
THIS ISLET CELL THING EITHER?

16:04.634 --> 16:07.967
I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING RESPONSES
ALL DAY TO AN INSULIN CHALLENGE,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.569
AND JUST NOTHING.
(beep)

16:09.569 --> 16:11.741
SEE THAT,
THAT RIGHT THERE?

16:11.741 --> 16:13.543
OOH, YEAH!

16:13.543 --> 16:16.546
THAT USED TO BE
A CURLY FRY.

16:16.546 --> 16:18.508
AND I USED TO BE
A SURGEON.

16:18.508 --> 16:19.579
(laughs)
(cell phone chimes)

16:19.579 --> 16:20.980
OOH. JANET.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.582
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU KEEP THE FAITH.

16:22.582 --> 16:25.515
"DEAR CLIENT, I WILL BE
OUT OF THE OFFICE ALL WEEK."

16:28.018 --> 16:29.989
I'VE BEEN PICTURING HER
MAKING CALLS,

16:29.989 --> 16:31.721
FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT
TO GET ME MY KID BACK,

16:31.721 --> 16:33.563
NOT SITTING ON A BEACH
SOMEWHERE.

16:33.563 --> 16:35.595
I KNOW. MER.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.567
ZOLA'S PROBABLY FORGOTTEN US
BY NOW.

16:38.768 --> 16:40.600
(door closes)

16:43.533 --> 16:46.536
(indistinct conversations)

16:49.739 --> 16:52.482
UH, HEY. UH...

16:53.783 --> 16:55.485
EXCUSE ME.

16:55.485 --> 16:56.716
UM, I'M TRYING TO GET
SOME INFORMATION

16:56.716 --> 16:58.548
ABOUT AN ADOPTION CASE.

16:58.548 --> 16:59.789
I'M SURE YOU'LL MAKE
A WONDERFUL FATHER,

16:59.789 --> 17:02.052
BUT UNTIL THE JUDGE RULES
A CASE CLOSED, I CA--

17:02.052 --> 17:03.793
OH, I'M NOT THE DAD.
I'M THE DOCTOR.

17:03.793 --> 17:05.525
THE KID'S SICK AND--

17:05.525 --> 17:07.557
SWEETHEART, I'VE HEARD
EVERY SAD STORY IN THE BOOK.

17:07.557 --> 17:09.729
IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT
WE DON'T RELEASE INFORMATION

17:09.729 --> 17:11.561
ON PENDING CASES

17:11.561 --> 17:13.663
YOU KNOW, I, UH...

17:13.663 --> 17:16.606
I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE
THE DYSPLASTIC NEVUS--

17:16.606 --> 17:18.538
THE MOLE.
WHAT?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.070
YEAH, ANYONE EVER
CHECK THAT FOR YOU?

17:20.070 --> 17:21.711
YES, BUT...

17:21.711 --> 17:23.543
THEY SAID
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.674
NOT NOW ANYWAY.

17:24.674 --> 17:26.776
ME? I WOULDN'T TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

17:26.776 --> 17:28.518
OH, DEAR.

17:28.518 --> 17:31.050
OH, RIGHT.
CRAPPY GOVERNMENT INSURANCE.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.722
THAT WOULD BE
ON THE DEDUCTIBLE.

17:32.722 --> 17:34.084
(sighs)
(chuckles)

17:34.084 --> 17:36.556
HEY, LOOK,
I'M A SURGEON.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.058
YOU GIVE ME THE STATS
ON THIS KID,

17:39.058 --> 17:41.531
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU
FOR FREE.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.541
(typing)

17:51.541 --> 17:52.602
(beep)

17:52.602 --> 17:53.643
YEAH, SHE'S ON
JUDGE BRENTNER'S DOCKET.

17:53.643 --> 17:55.745
LET'S SEE IF, UH...

17:55.745 --> 17:57.547
OH, WAIT. HE'S NOT EVEN
HERE TODAY.

17:57.547 --> 17:58.808
HE'S GETTING CHEMO.

17:58.808 --> 18:00.750
SO SAD. PROSTATE.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.552
MM.

18:02.552 --> 18:04.814
HEY, YOU'RE A DOCTOR.
IS THAT ONE OF THE BAD ONES?

18:04.814 --> 18:07.117
MM, NOT NECESSARILY.

18:07.117 --> 18:10.620
DEPENDS ON WHERE
HE'S GETTING IT TREATED.

18:14.824 --> 18:17.567
IT COULD BE
POSTPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.129
I'LL TRANSFER HER
TO TELEMETRY.

18:19.129 --> 18:20.630
OKAY.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.672
HEY, DR. ALTMAN.

18:22.672 --> 18:24.674
WHY IS CRISTINA DOING
AN ANGIOPLASTY?

18:24.674 --> 18:25.775
EXCUSE ME?

18:25.775 --> 18:27.777
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
AND I KNOW SHE WAS, TOO.

18:27.777 --> 18:30.109
IS--IS THIS ALL
GOING SOMEWHERE?

18:30.109 --> 18:31.811
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S
NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT--

18:31.811 --> 18:33.112
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.115
AS A FIRST YEAR,

18:36.115 --> 18:37.887
YOU DO AN ANGIO
TO LEARN A TECHNICAL SKILL,

18:37.887 --> 18:41.591
BUT AN ANGIO AS A FIFTH YEAR
IS ABOUT LEARNING RESPECT--

18:41.591 --> 18:43.122
RESPECT FOR THE HEART DISEASE

18:43.122 --> 18:45.625
THAT CRISTINA WILL SEE
FOR THE REST OF HER CAREER.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.827
IT ALL STARTS THERE,
IN THE ARTERY.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.699
YOU HAVE TO GO BACK
TO THE BEGINNING

18:49.699 --> 18:51.801
TO UNDERSTAND THE END.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.869
BACK TO THE BEGINNING.

18:59.869 --> 19:01.171
ALL RIGHT, SO MOVE AVERY
TO SHORTSTOP

19:01.171 --> 19:02.642
AND PUT BAILEY
IN CENTER FIELD.

19:02.642 --> 19:03.673
BAILEY? WHY BAILEY?

19:03.673 --> 19:04.774
WELL, BECAUSE BAILEY'S
A LEADER.

19:04.774 --> 19:06.176
SHE'LL KNOW WHO TO GET
THE BALL TO.

19:06.176 --> 19:07.817
SHE'S NOT YOUR CUTOFF MAN.
AVERY, HE'S YOUR CUTOFF MAN.

19:07.817 --> 19:08.848
OKAY.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.820
SHE'S TALL.
WHERE DO YOU HAVE HER?

19:10.820 --> 19:12.822
UH... LEFT FIELD.

19:12.822 --> 19:14.684
CAN SHE CATCH?
(clipboard clatters)

19:14.684 --> 19:16.926
UH, LET'S FIND OUT.

19:16.926 --> 19:18.828
GREY, CATCH.

19:18.828 --> 19:20.790
HUNT, WHAT THE HELL?

19:20.790 --> 19:22.762
NOW HE'S YOUR CUTOFF MAN.
YEAH.

19:22.762 --> 19:23.763
(elevator bell dings)

19:23.763 --> 19:25.695
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.

19:25.695 --> 19:26.836
I NEED MY MOTHER'S JOURNALS.

19:26.836 --> 19:27.937
WHY? WHAT'S UP?

19:27.937 --> 19:29.769
WELL, I NEED TO SEE
HER ORIGINAL HYPOTHESIS.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.170
IF I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON,

19:31.170 --> 19:32.902
THEN I NEED TO START
WHERE SHE STARTED.

19:32.902 --> 19:34.704
AHA! (lowered voice) AHA.

19:34.704 --> 19:36.706
I KNEW ONCE YOU PICKED IT UP,
YOU COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.

19:36.706 --> 19:38.908
DON'T GLOAT.
WHERE ARE THEY?
COME ON.

19:38.908 --> 19:39.909
(elevator bell dings)

19:39.909 --> 19:40.910
(bat hits ball)
(Derek grunts)

19:40.910 --> 19:41.911
NICE.

19:41.911 --> 19:43.182
UH...
(grunts)

19:43.182 --> 19:44.784
THE PATIENT AND HER MOTHER

19:44.784 --> 19:46.856
ARE WONDERING
IF SHE'S HAVING SURGERY TODAY.

19:46.856 --> 19:48.918
SHOULD I TELL THEM
THAT YOU ARE STILL WORKING?

19:48.918 --> 19:50.220
WE ARE WORKING.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.662
SOMETIMES THE BODY
THINKS BETTER THAN THE BRAIN.

19:52.662 --> 19:53.863
(groans)
(cell phone rings)

19:53.863 --> 19:55.765
GREY, TOSS HIM A BALL.

19:55.765 --> 19:57.927
HELLO. YEAH. YEAH.

19:57.927 --> 19:59.899
I THOUGHT THE BOARD MEETING
WOULD BE PUSHED TO THURSDAY.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.971
MM. (grunts)

20:01.971 --> 20:03.833
OH, YOUR SWING'S TOO HIGH.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.235
DID YOU PLAY BALL?

20:05.235 --> 20:06.736
YEAH.

20:06.736 --> 20:07.807
I WAS A PITCHER.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.239
REALLY?
YEAH.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.210
RIGHT, INTO THE PARKING...
(speaks indistinctly)
(grunts)

20:11.210 --> 20:12.812
MARK'S IN LOVE.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.913
OH, WITH AN EYE DOCTOR.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.685
THAT SHOULD LAST 48 HOURS.

20:15.685 --> 20:16.986
YEAH, WELL,
I SHOULD BE HAPPY FOR HIM.

20:16.986 --> 20:18.718
(grunts)

20:18.718 --> 20:19.749
(Owen) DON'T WORRY ABOUT.

20:19.749 --> 20:20.750
JUST SHAKE IT OFF
OR SHAKE IT OUT

20:20.750 --> 20:22.221
OR I DON'T KNOW,
SHAKE SOMETHING.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.853
IT'S HIS
NEW COACHING PERSONA.

20:23.853 --> 20:25.755
YEAH, I'M STILL WORKING
ON IT.

20:26.756 --> 20:27.757
(grunts)

20:27.757 --> 20:28.958
YOU'RE STILL
COMING AT IT WRONG.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.830
YOU'RE--YOU'RE--YOU'RE
APPROACHING THE BALL WRONG.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.961
I'M HOLDING THE BAT WRONG?

20:31.961 --> 20:33.863
NO, NO, NO, IT'S NOT THE BAT.
IT'S YOUR BODY.

20:33.863 --> 20:35.905
YOU NEED TO...
ADJUST YOUR HEAD,

20:35.905 --> 20:38.007
DROP YOUR SHOULDER.

20:38.007 --> 20:40.840
I MEAN,
YOU'RE NOT CONNECTING.

20:43.973 --> 20:45.915
THE HEAD'S AT THE WRONG ANGLE.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.778
I'VE BEEN ADJUSTING
THE PROBE.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.920
YOU NEED TO ADJUST
THE ANGLE OF HER HEAD.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.758
I WENT BACK TO THE LAB
TO TEST MY APPROACH.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.490
THERE'S A VERY GOOD SHOT

21:00.490 --> 21:02.532
I CAN ACCESS THE TUMOR
FROM ABOVE.

21:02.532 --> 21:04.464
I THINK WE CAN GET IT ALL.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.795
A GOOD SHOT?

21:05.795 --> 21:07.637
THIS IS MY CHILD.

21:07.637 --> 21:09.539
MM. WELL, THERE ARE RISKS
EITHER WAY,

21:09.539 --> 21:10.840
UH, BUT THIS CERTAINLY HAS
MORE RISKS.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.643
SO SHE COULD DIE
IN SURGERY.

21:13.643 --> 21:14.774
(sighs)

21:14.774 --> 21:17.507
LOOK, THANK YOU FOR TRYING,
DR. SHEPHERD, BUT I...

21:17.507 --> 21:20.550
I CAN'T LET MY LITTLE GIRL
BE YOUR GUINEA PIG.

21:22.712 --> 21:24.654
MRS. BAYER,

21:24.654 --> 21:26.656
NOW IN ALL YOUR RESEARCH,

21:26.656 --> 21:29.789
HAVE YOU EVER FOUND A STORY
OF A KID WITH AN H.H. TUMOR

21:29.789 --> 21:32.492
WHO EVER GOT BETTER...

21:32.492 --> 21:33.863
WHO EVER GOT A JOB,

21:33.863 --> 21:35.765
HAD A LIFE?

21:38.598 --> 21:41.631
THIS IS THE BEST SHOT
YOU'LL HAVE.

21:54.784 --> 21:56.716
(Owen) ALTMAN.
SLOAN, YOU'RE ON FIRST.

21:56.716 --> 21:58.718
OH, BAILEY,
YOU'RE CENTER FIELD.

21:58.718 --> 21:59.889
WE'RE DOING
SOME SHUFFLING.

21:59.889 --> 22:00.890
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

22:00.890 --> 22:02.722
I WORK HERE.

22:02.722 --> 22:04.794
UH, I MAY NOT EVEN
MAKE THE GAME.

22:04.794 --> 22:08.658
I GOT 49 TRIAL PATIENTS
LEFT TO CALL.

22:08.658 --> 22:10.800
I GOTTA GIVE THEM THE SAME
BAD NEWS I GAVE YOU.

22:10.800 --> 22:11.861
OUCH. THAT'S ROUGH.

22:11.861 --> 22:13.763
WE NEED A SUB
FOR CENTER FIELD.

22:13.763 --> 22:15.805
YEAH. UH, SHEPHERD,
PITCHER.

22:15.805 --> 22:16.906
SHEPHERD'S OUT.

22:16.906 --> 22:18.738
HE TOLD ME HIS BRAIN SURGERY
COULD BE A MARATHON.

22:18.738 --> 22:20.570
OH! ME. LET ME PITCH.

22:20.570 --> 22:21.841
OKAY.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.713
ALL RIGHT, ALTMAN, PITCHER.
YES.

22:23.713 --> 22:24.714
SLOAN, FIRST.

22:24.714 --> 22:25.715
SHEPHERD CAN BE
A PINCH HITTER.

22:25.715 --> 22:26.716
OKAY, TORRES, YOU'RE ON--

22:26.716 --> 22:27.877
I NEED YOU TO SIGN
FOR THIS.

22:27.877 --> 22:30.820
BONE PLATES AND TITANIUM MESH?
THAT'S A LOT OF HARDWARE.

22:30.820 --> 22:33.683
MM-HMM.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS GUY'S
HAND WASN'T SALVAGEABLE.

22:33.683 --> 22:34.884
YEAH, WELL, I'M GONNA TRY
AND REBUILD IT.

22:34.884 --> 22:37.787
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY COOL.
APRIL, MEET ME IN THE O.R.

22:37.787 --> 22:38.858
I NEED A SMALL.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.730
OH, THEY'RE ALL LARGES.
(April) WHAT?

22:40.730 --> 22:42.892
NO. WE CAN'T BE OUT
OF SMALLS ALREADY.

22:42.892 --> 22:45.665
I TOLD THEM WE NEEDED
AN ASSORTMENT OF SIZES.

22:45.665 --> 22:48.668
I... I WAS VERY CLEAR
ON THE PHONE.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.669
(sighs)

22:49.669 --> 22:50.940
SWEET.

22:50.940 --> 22:52.942
I'LL LOOK FANTASTIC IN THIS.

22:52.942 --> 22:54.944
AND WHEN YOU LOOK GOOD,
YOU PLAY GOOD.

22:54.944 --> 22:56.706
AM I RIGHT, AVERY?

22:56.706 --> 22:58.608
YOU KNOW IT.

22:59.649 --> 23:01.881
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
WHAT?

23:01.881 --> 23:03.913
WHAT, ARE YOU GUYS PLEDGING
DELTA CHI TOGETHER?

23:03.913 --> 23:05.655
NO, SLOAN'S PRETTY COOL,
ACTUALLY.

23:05.655 --> 23:07.657
HE'S, UH, BEEN IN
SUCH A GOOD MOOD LATELY,

23:07.657 --> 23:09.619
HE'S LETTING ME DO
HALF HIS PROCEDURES.

23:09.619 --> 23:12.722
HE LET ME RUN
THE BURN CENTER LAST NIGHT.

23:13.893 --> 23:14.924
NEAT.

23:14.924 --> 23:16.666
OKAY.

23:16.666 --> 23:17.867
OKAY, GREY, YOU'RE, UH...

23:19.869 --> 23:21.701
WINNING IS AN ATTITUDE.

23:21.701 --> 23:22.932
WE'RE WINNERS.

23:22.932 --> 23:24.904
YEAH.

23:26.876 --> 23:28.978
(Callie) OKAY, SO THIS

23:28.978 --> 23:30.940
WILL HOLD HIS HAND
IN PLACE

23:30.940 --> 23:32.942
SO I CAN SEE THE TENDON
AND NERVE GAPS, AND--

23:32.942 --> 23:35.645
WHAT THE CHIEF DOESN'T REALIZE
IS THAT A LOT OF THE WORK I DO

23:35.645 --> 23:37.887
MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR
THESE SURGERIES TO TAKE PLACE.

23:37.887 --> 23:38.918
I MEAN, ALL THE--

23:38.918 --> 23:41.751
ALL THE STAFFING
AND SCHEDULING, I--

23:41.751 --> 23:42.892
I MEAN, SO MAYBE--

23:42.892 --> 23:44.854
OKAY, MAYBE I'M NOT
IN THE O.R. ALL THE TIME--

23:44.854 --> 23:45.955
APRIL.
BUT I--

23:45.955 --> 23:47.757
DO YOU WANT TO BE
AN ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT?

23:47.757 --> 23:48.898
IS THAT WHAT MAKES
YOUR HEART SING?

23:48.898 --> 23:49.959
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

23:49.959 --> 23:51.661
THEN STOP BEING A WHINER.

23:51.661 --> 23:52.862
STOP HIDING BEHIND PAPERWORK.

23:52.862 --> 23:55.705
IF YOU LOVE IT, DO IT.
JUST GET IN THE O.R.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.007
OKAY? DON'T SLEEP, DON'T EAT.

23:58.007 --> 24:00.670
JUST DO THIS.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.741
(instrument clatters)

24:01.741 --> 24:02.772

24:02.772 --> 24:04.844
YOU WANT ME TO PLACE
THE K-WIRE?

24:04.844 --> 24:06.916
WILL IT MAKE YOUR HEART SING?

24:06.916 --> 24:08.748
(laughs) YES.
YEAH, RIGHT.

24:08.748 --> 24:09.779

24:09.779 --> 24:11.821
OKAY, PLACING THE WIRE.

24:11.821 --> 24:13.983
OKAY. OH, YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.
OKAY, I GOT IT. SORRY.

24:13.983 --> 24:15.955
THERE YOU GO. RIGHT THERE.
GOOD. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.657
(monitor beeping erratically)
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
I SWEAR.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.788
DAMN IT. NO, JUST STOP.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:18.788 --> 24:19.829
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT HIS PRESSURE'S TANKING.

24:19.829 --> 24:20.960
I'M HANGING BLOOD.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.962
IT LOOKS LIKE
ELECTRICAL ALTERNANS.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.764
HE'S TAMPONADING.

24:24.764 --> 24:26.035
WHAT THE HELL? PAGE CARDIO.

24:26.035 --> 24:27.867
THESE THINGS I NEED DONE.
IS THAT OKAY?

24:27.867 --> 24:29.899
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

24:29.899 --> 24:30.970
SORRY.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.803
WHAT IS THAT?

24:33.803 --> 24:35.705
UH, MY MOM'S JOURNAL.

24:35.705 --> 24:37.677
NO, I KNOWWHATIT IS.
WHY DO YOU HAVE IT?

24:37.677 --> 24:40.950
BECAUSE IT'S MY MOM'S JOURNAL.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.958
(monitor beeping erratically)

24:48.958 --> 24:51.691
FREEZE IT. INTRALUMINAL FLAP
AND PERICARDIAL EFFUSION.

24:51.691 --> 24:52.822
DAMN IT.
HE'S GOT A DISSECTION.

24:52.822 --> 24:53.893
THAT'S WHY HE FELL.

24:53.893 --> 24:54.894
IT MUST HAVE STARTED
WHEN HE WAS ON THE TRUCK.

24:54.894 --> 24:55.895
HE PROBABLY PASSED OUT.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.967
OH, GOD.
UH, WE NEED TO GET ALTMAN.

24:57.967 --> 24:58.968
WHY? DO WE NEED TO GO--

24:58.968 --> 24:59.969
YES, WE NEED TO OPEN HIM
RIGHT NOW.

24:59.969 --> 25:01.701
UM, APRIL START
THE THORACOTOMY.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.703
WHAT? ME? WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:03.703 --> 25:05.735
GETTING GOWNED AND GLOVED.
CRACK HIS CHEST.

25:05.735 --> 25:07.777
BUT I--I'M ASSISTING. I--
IT'S ALL RIGHT. I GOT THIS.

25:07.777 --> 25:08.838
GO DO YOUR THING.

25:08.838 --> 25:10.009
BUT I'VE NEVER DONE
AN AORTIC DISSECTION.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.741
APRIL, CRACK HIS CHEST NOW.

25:11.741 --> 25:13.743
UM, 10-BLADE.

25:13.743 --> 25:15.785
HERE YOU GO, DOCTOR.
THANK YOU.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.792
(beeping continues)

25:27.857 --> 25:29.528
(whirs)

25:29.528 --> 25:30.760
OKAY, HERE'S THE TEAR.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.802
OKAY, OPEN THE AORTA
LONGITUDINALLY.

25:32.802 --> 25:35.534
(suction gurgling)

25:35.534 --> 25:36.535
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:36.535 --> 25:37.807
NOW TRANSECT PROXIMAL

25:37.807 --> 25:39.609
TO THE INNOMINATE ARTERY.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.872
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS?

25:42.872 --> 25:44.814
YOU'RE ALREADY THERE.

25:44.814 --> 25:45.815
(door opens)

25:45.815 --> 25:47.717
(Teddy) ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

25:47.717 --> 25:49.649
A THORACIC AORTIC DISSECTION.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.820
UH, KEPNER EXCISED
THE DEFECT

25:50.820 --> 25:52.682
AND HE'S GOING TO NEED
A GRAFT.

25:52.682 --> 25:54.624
ALL RIGHT.
LET ME GET SCRUBBED.

25:54.624 --> 25:56.626
YOU'LL FIRST ASSIST.
TORRES, CAN YOU CLEAR OUT?

25:56.626 --> 25:57.787
CAN YOU WORK AROUND ME?

25:57.787 --> 25:59.659
UH, I MEAN, I'D--I'LL MOVE
IF I HAVE TO, BUT--

25:59.659 --> 26:00.760
TORRES, I'M TRYING TO--

26:00.760 --> 26:01.761
I KNOW, BUT TRUST ME,
I'M SAVING HIS LIFE, TOO.

26:01.761 --> 26:02.892
CAN YOU WORK AROUND ME?

26:02.892 --> 26:04.563
FINE.

26:07.597 --> 26:09.568
YANG, WHY DIDN'T YOU
JUST START THE GRAFT?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.601
I DIDN'T NEED TO.
KEPNER HAD IT.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.677
OKAY.

26:17.677 --> 26:18.878
I'VE GOT SOME OF IT,

26:18.878 --> 26:22.682
BUT I NEED TO CHANGE THE ANGLE
TO GET THE REST OF IT.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.814
OKAY, LET'S RELEASE
THE MAYFIELD, PLEASE.

26:24.814 --> 26:26.656
I NEED YOU
TO HOLD THE PROBE STEADY

26:26.656 --> 26:28.818
SO I CAN ADJUST THE ANGLE.

26:28.818 --> 26:30.589
YOU'RE NOT TAKING IT OUT?

26:30.589 --> 26:31.761
IT'S TOO RISKY.

26:31.761 --> 26:32.892
IF WE GO OUTSIDE OF THE TRACK,

26:32.892 --> 26:35.594
WE COULD HIT
HEALTHY BRAIN TISSUE.

26:35.594 --> 26:36.726
COME ON. TAKE THE PROBE.

26:36.726 --> 26:37.927
HOLD IT STILL.

26:37.927 --> 26:39.899
MOVE IT EVEN 1 MILLIMETER,
IT'S OVER.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.932
READY?
LET'S GIVE IT A WHIRL.

26:42.932 --> 26:44.734
OKAY, GOOD. I THINK...

26:44.734 --> 26:45.975
THE TUMOR'S DROPPED
INTO THE FIELD.

26:45.975 --> 26:47.677
LET'S TIGHTEN THE DEVICE.

26:47.677 --> 26:48.708
(exhales deeply)

26:48.708 --> 26:49.779
OKAY. GOOD JOB.

26:49.779 --> 26:51.911
OKAY, LET'S START

26:51.911 --> 26:54.744
VERY SLOWLY.

26:56.886 --> 26:57.947
GO AHEAD.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.852
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:02.852 --> 27:04.754
HEART RATE'S 130.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

27:04.754 --> 27:05.895
THE TUMOR IS PULLING
ON THE HYPOTHALAMUS.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.927
PUSH 20 OF LABETALOL,
PLEASE.

27:07.927 --> 27:09.759
GREY, HOLD THE RETRACTOR.

27:09.759 --> 27:10.930
LET ME TAKE THIS.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.763
HEART RATE'S 160.

27:13.763 --> 27:14.964
AH, DAMN IT.
I'M PULLING OUT THE PROBE.

27:14.964 --> 27:15.965

WE'RE NOT G--

THERE'S STILL TUMOR LEFT.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.852

27:32.852 --> 27:35.825

27:46.736 --> 27:47.897

27:50.970 --> 27:52.872
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
START THE GRAFT YOURSELF?

27:52.872 --> 27:53.973
WHY'D YOU WAIT?

27:53.973 --> 27:55.975
IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION?

27:55.975 --> 27:57.777
NO. I'M ASKING.

27:57.777 --> 27:58.848
OH, COME ON.

27:58.848 --> 28:00.750
NOW I'M IN TROUBLE
FOR WAITING FOR YOU?

28:00.750 --> 28:02.712
YOU WOULD'VE RIPPED ME A NEW ONE
IF I DID IT MYSELF.

28:02.712 --> 28:04.984
TWO MONTHS AGO, YOU WOULD'VE
BODYCHECKED KEPNER

28:04.984 --> 28:06.685
IN ORDER TO GET
INTO THIS GUY'S CHEST,

28:06.685 --> 28:07.957
AND NOW YOU LET HER
JUST DO THE SURGERY?

28:07.957 --> 28:09.058
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
LIKE KEPNER.

28:09.058 --> 28:11.761
THIS IS TRUE.

28:11.761 --> 28:13.022
(Cristina) UH, YES,
I COULD'VE DONE IT MYSELF,

28:13.022 --> 28:14.824

28:30.840 --> 28:32.041

28:32.041 --> 28:34.043

WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO.

28:34.043 --> 28:36.045
I AM IN TROUBLE IF I CUT.
I'M IN TROUBLE IF I DON'T CUT.
