00:27.129 --> 00:28.510
I'm not late, am I?

00:28.539 --> 00:30.609
No, no, we're still
waiting on a few people.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.060
Help yourself to a beverage.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.250
- Thank you.
- Hello.

00:35.140 --> 00:37.369
I'll just have a black coffee,
please.

00:37.399 --> 00:39.590
- OK.
- Oh, no, no.

00:39.619 --> 00:40.909
Jackie doesn't work here.

00:40.939 --> 00:43.079
She's our member of the public.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.780
She's actually on the jury.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.289
Gosh, sorry. I didn't mean to...

00:46.320 --> 00:48.270
Oh, that's all right,
I don't mind!

00:48.439 --> 00:49.960
I'm Clive Carol.
Pleased to meet you.

00:49.990 --> 00:52.359
Clive's one of our finest
writers, aren't you?

00:52.390 --> 00:54.710
He won the Breakthrough Talent
Award for television drama.

00:55.310 --> 00:55.950
When was this?

00:55.979 --> 00:59.210
- Oh, a couple of years ago.
- 2003, wasn't it?

01:00.880 --> 01:02.710
Was it that long ago? Yeah,
I suppose it was, actually.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.828
Now,
obviously you'll know Rupert.

01:04.858 --> 01:05.730
Have you two worked together?

01:05.760 --> 01:07.379
No, I'd love to. Huge fan.

01:07.409 --> 01:08.039
Hello.

01:08.069 --> 01:11.109
And this is Gordon Norris.

01:11.390 --> 01:12.079
We know each other.

01:12.109 --> 01:13.879
Hi, Gordon.

01:13.909 --> 01:16.689
It's all a bit bloody pointless,
if you ask me.

01:16.750 --> 01:19.500
We already know who's
going to win, don't we?

01:19.530 --> 01:21.739
What's she called,
the girl who's in everything?

01:21.769 --> 01:22.829
Shona Andrews.

01:22.859 --> 01:26.299
Let's not prejudge.
There's a long way to go yet.

01:26.329 --> 01:28.319
Gordon, I don't know
if you've had a chance

01:28.349 --> 01:30.140
to have a quick read of
that script I sent through?

01:30.170 --> 01:30.780
No, I haven't, Clive.

01:30.810 --> 01:33.979
I'm in post on Doctor Who and I'm
prepping the new Jimmy Nesbitt vehicle,

01:34.009 --> 01:35.180
so I'm a little tied
up at the moment.

01:35.210 --> 01:37.920
Yeah, it's just that Sky are
really, really interested.

01:37.950 --> 01:40.670
And, you know, script by me, directed
by you, that's a really good package.

01:40.700 --> 01:44.789
Yes, Clive. It's on the list,
but it's, er... It's not for now.

01:44.819 --> 01:47.020
Absolutely. I agree.
Whatever you say.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.299
Oh, it's here, April!

01:49.329 --> 01:50.640
We're in here!

01:50.689 --> 01:53.299
Hello, everybody.

01:56.490 --> 01:58.759
Oh,
and I'm Paula and I'm the couch.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.310
Rupert?

02:01.930 --> 02:04.700
God, you're here?

02:04.980 --> 02:06.849
Oh, you got old!

02:09.479 --> 02:12.610
Oh, have you met?
What was your name, sweetheart?

02:14.639 --> 02:16.180
Yes, I know Rupert.

02:16.319 --> 02:17.960
I've interviewed him
on several occasions.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.379
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

02:22.759 --> 02:25.150
- Who is this?
- Got no idea.

02:25.300 --> 02:27.219
Right well, we are all met,

02:27.250 --> 02:30.729
so shall we make a start as there's
a huge amount to get through?

02:31.849 --> 02:35.069
Can I suggest we begin in time-honoured
fashion by just going around the room

02:35.099 --> 02:36.750
and saying who we
are and what we do?

02:36.780 --> 02:39.389
So, I'm Giles Grindlay-Orme,

02:39.420 --> 02:43.050
and I am Associate Chair of the
Television Committee here at the Academy.

02:43.870 --> 02:47.370
I'm June Bright
and I'm an alcoholic.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.870
No!

02:50.990 --> 02:55.280
I'm a journalist and TV critic
for the Sunday Mirror.

02:56.009 --> 02:59.819
Rupert Dennis, actor,
treader of boards,

03:00.090 --> 03:02.370
now old, apparently.

03:05.949 --> 03:08.949
Oh, is it me? I'm Jackie.

03:09.129 --> 03:11.800
I'm a dentist's receptionist.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.129
I've never done anything
like this before.

03:14.449 --> 03:15.840
I won a competition.

03:15.870 --> 03:17.590
Yes, I should point
out the Academy thought

03:17.620 --> 03:20.310
it was very important to
hear the voice of the viewer.

03:20.340 --> 03:24.389
So, this year each jury
has a member of the public

03:24.420 --> 03:27.039
giving us the benefit
of their unique insight.

03:27.170 --> 03:28.370
Gordon?

03:29.170 --> 03:31.420
Oh, yes. Gordon Norris.

03:31.569 --> 03:33.079
Film and TV director.

03:34.409 --> 03:37.229
Clive Carol, scribbler, dreamer.

03:38.639 --> 03:39.699
Also a member of the public.

03:39.729 --> 03:41.500
I did win the
Breakthrough Talent Award.

03:41.530 --> 03:42.840
Yada, yada, yada!

03:42.870 --> 03:45.000
I'm Paula, you all know me.

03:45.030 --> 03:47.189
And I'm here doing
a West End show.

03:47.659 --> 03:50.379
And I've got a costume fitting at
four, so we'd better, you know...

03:50.409 --> 03:52.139
Oh, absolutely,
thank you, Paula.

03:52.170 --> 03:55.620
So, we are here to judge
the Best Actress category.

03:55.650 --> 03:57.689
I have to ask that you have
all watched the performances

03:57.719 --> 03:59.150
up for consideration this year

03:59.180 --> 04:03.030
and that there are no conflicts of
interest that may colour your judgment.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.270
Right, well, let's begin.

04:05.300 --> 04:09.280
As you know, we have a
long list of eight names,

04:09.310 --> 04:11.919
which we need to whittle
down to four nominees.

04:11.949 --> 04:14.300
I'm sure we can get rid of a
few of these pretty quickly.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.560
Zoe Chappell?

04:15.759 --> 04:17.410
No. No. No.

04:17.439 --> 04:19.379
She's off the list.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.430
Tina Waddingham, anyone?

04:21.459 --> 04:23.170
- She was good.
- Not for me.

04:23.199 --> 04:24.459
No, me neither.

04:24.569 --> 04:27.170
Yeah,
I don't think it's her year.

04:27.199 --> 04:29.089
As I thought.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.300
What about Brenda Dobbie?

04:30.329 --> 04:31.529
No!

04:32.300 --> 04:35.639
Ok. That's pretty clear.
Poor Brenda.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.290
- Kelly Marsden?
- Absolutely not.

04:39.319 --> 04:42.500
I don't understand how
she even got on the list.

04:42.529 --> 04:43.829
I've interviewed Kelly.

04:43.860 --> 04:46.930
She's a very clever girl,
believe me. Very ambitious.

04:49.670 --> 04:53.209
Can we keep the discussion just
to her acting ability, please?

04:53.240 --> 04:55.120
Well, in that case,
I thought she was pretty good.

04:55.149 --> 04:58.209
- I liked her.
- Well, that's good enough for me.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.430
Samira Denham?

05:01.810 --> 05:03.339
Terrible. Too young.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.949
Well, you know,
Samira can be good.

05:04.980 --> 05:06.110
She just needs a good director.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.110
I don't know what was
going on with her acting.

05:08.139 --> 05:09.269
She was supposed to
be doing Cockney.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.529
She sounded like
she was Australian.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.069
Yeah, she's shit.
It was like, you know,

05:12.100 --> 05:15.529
"Go down the apples and pears
and get me some jellied eels!"

05:16.100 --> 05:17.310
I'm just agreeing with you,
Gordon.

05:17.339 --> 05:18.709
Yeah, that is so true.

05:18.740 --> 05:20.269
Well, she's gone.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.399
So, by my reckoning that
leaves us with a shortlist of

05:23.430 --> 05:27.579
Shona Andrews, Dame Dorothy Sutton,
Kelly Marsden and Anna Adeyemi.

05:27.610 --> 05:30.240
Is everyone happy with
these four as our nominees?

05:30.269 --> 05:31.430
Yes.

05:31.459 --> 05:33.069
Good. Well, that was painless.

05:37.220 --> 05:40.149
So, what we'll do now is
discuss each one in turn,

05:40.180 --> 05:43.949
then you'll all get a chance to vote
anonymously to determine the winner.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.459
I myself will remain impartial.

05:46.490 --> 05:49.090
OK, let's kick off with Shona.

05:50.590 --> 05:51.959
Who wants to start?

05:53.129 --> 05:54.329
Jackie!

05:55.310 --> 05:57.579
Just brilliant.

05:57.610 --> 05:59.480
She's always brilliant,
isn't she?

05:59.509 --> 06:01.120
You could watch her in anything.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.540
She did that thing a couple of
years ago when she was a nurse.

06:05.569 --> 06:07.620
- What was that called?
- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

06:07.649 --> 06:09.529
Look, I mean,
I've never worked with her.

06:09.569 --> 06:10.839
But the camera loves her.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.759
She's got that 360 range and
she's always, always committed.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.699
- I think she nailed it.
- Paula, would you agree?

06:17.980 --> 06:21.329
Shona Andrews stole my heart.

06:21.670 --> 06:25.120
Moving, truthful, devastating.

06:25.149 --> 06:27.730
This was a different kind
of role for her, wasn't it?

06:27.759 --> 06:29.230
Just talk a little
bit about that.

06:29.259 --> 06:33.100
Well, this was a different kind of
role for her, totally different.

06:33.840 --> 06:35.170
She played, er...

06:36.220 --> 06:37.540
Madam Curry.

06:37.569 --> 06:38.990
Marie Curie.

06:39.019 --> 06:41.569
Yes, the woman who
invented the radio.

06:41.909 --> 06:44.769
And I totally bought it,
the whole package.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.879
Yeah, she is what I call
one of the anointed.

06:47.909 --> 06:49.149
She can do no wrong.

06:49.470 --> 06:51.879
And even though she was 30
years too young for the part,

06:51.909 --> 06:53.459
I have to admit she
was really very good.

06:53.490 --> 06:55.629
Well, what does it
matter how old she is?

06:55.829 --> 06:57.850
She brought Marie
Curie to life for me.

06:57.879 --> 07:00.930
I mean, it was a very
dry and boring subject,

07:00.959 --> 07:03.560
but my ex-partner and
I sat there transfixed.

07:03.709 --> 07:06.720
I never even knew Marie
Curie was a real person.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.379
I thought it was a magazine.

07:08.670 --> 07:10.300
And that made it even more...

07:11.569 --> 07:14.350
..Better, if that's not
a stupid thing to say.

07:14.379 --> 07:16.959
No. No, no, it isn't,
not at all.

07:16.990 --> 07:20.290
It's exactly that kind of observation
we were hoping to get from you, Jackie.

07:20.480 --> 07:20.949
Well done.

07:20.980 --> 07:23.470
I have a problem
with this actress.

07:23.500 --> 07:25.620
She mumbles.

07:25.790 --> 07:29.019
I couldn't make out
half of what she said.

07:29.050 --> 07:33.159
Having said that, I was a
blubbering wreck by the end.

07:33.189 --> 07:34.990
A remarkable performance.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.670
- I agree.
- Oh, great.

07:37.699 --> 07:39.649
- Can we go now?
- No, no, no.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.560
We have to discuss all the nominees,
but let's just put a big tick for now

07:43.590 --> 07:45.840
and move on to Dame Dorothy.

07:46.990 --> 07:48.189
Rupert?

07:48.519 --> 07:50.959
I'm guessing you had no
problems with her diction?

07:50.990 --> 07:52.730
Absolutely not.

07:52.759 --> 07:54.090
Clear as a bell.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.800
I've got a lot of
time for Dotty.

07:57.159 --> 08:00.689
We came up through
the RSC together.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.699
Isn't that a
conflict of interest?

08:02.730 --> 08:05.470
No, we were on nodding terms,
that's all.

08:05.500 --> 08:08.389
She did a lot of nodding,
from what I heard.

08:08.430 --> 08:10.250
- Let's just...
- What's that supposed to mean?

08:10.279 --> 08:13.100
Come on, Rupert. You and
Dame Dotty do have a history.

08:13.129 --> 08:14.180
You can't deny it.

08:14.209 --> 08:14.769
I don't think

08:14.800 --> 08:20.860
a handjob in the car park
of the Dirty Duck in 1976

08:20.889 --> 08:22.509
is going to cloud my judgment.

08:22.540 --> 08:23.509
Well,
it does colour things slightly.

08:23.540 --> 08:25.829
Oh, come off it,
she did it for everybody!

08:25.860 --> 08:26.800
Well, let's not...

08:26.829 --> 08:29.019
Robin Nedwell, Brian Glover...

08:29.050 --> 08:31.449
I think we're going a
little bit off-piste there.

08:31.790 --> 08:34.299
But for the sake of
complete impartiality,

08:34.330 --> 08:37.110
why don't you sit out on this
one, Rupert, if you don't mind?

08:37.139 --> 08:38.340
Fine.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.370
Mumbling girl's going
to win it anyway.

08:43.679 --> 08:44.879
Paula?

08:45.730 --> 08:49.320
Dorothy Sutton stole my heart.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.669
She was perfectly
cast in the role,

08:53.129 --> 08:55.529
which saw her transform from

08:55.559 --> 08:59.970
waspish librarian to
warm-hearted widow

09:00.000 --> 09:02.679
with all the skill
of a seasoned pro.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.169
Hang on, that's my review!

09:04.659 --> 09:06.909
I wrote that for
the Sunday Mirror.

09:06.940 --> 09:08.769
Great minds think alike.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.840
Paula, you have watched all
these performances, haven't you?

09:11.870 --> 09:14.460
Sure, sure, my agent set
me up with all the links.

09:14.490 --> 09:17.190
OK. Gordon, what did you think?

09:17.220 --> 09:20.769
Yeah, I mean, yeah, she's a national
treasure and she's given a lot of people

09:20.799 --> 09:22.000
a lot of pleasure
over the years.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.960
Some more than others,
apparently.

09:23.990 --> 09:27.159
But I feel in this case she
was let down by the script,

09:27.190 --> 09:29.690
which just didn't seem
to go anywhere original.

09:29.720 --> 09:30.639
Yeah, I agree. I agree,

09:30.669 --> 09:33.419
because the script should take
you on a journey, shouldn't it?

09:33.450 --> 09:34.629
So if you read episode one,

09:34.659 --> 09:36.330
you really want to know
what happens in episode two,

09:36.360 --> 09:38.620
and there are many more ideas
that can be explored there.

09:40.700 --> 09:41.480
I will read it, Clive.

09:41.509 --> 09:42.049
Brilliant, no worries.

09:42.080 --> 09:45.639
Let's just remember what this
award is for, Best Actress,

09:45.669 --> 09:48.500
and we should be focusing on
just the elements of performance.

09:49.080 --> 09:52.360
Jackie, let's get the view
from the sofa, as it were.

09:52.389 --> 09:54.419
Are you a Dame Dotty fan?

09:54.450 --> 09:58.000
I love her. She really
reminds me of my grandma.

09:58.529 --> 10:02.240
Apart from the wanking
men off in car parks bit.

10:02.730 --> 10:06.779
But she's always
so funny and so...

10:07.899 --> 10:10.820
..Twinkly, if that's a word?

10:10.850 --> 10:12.850
It is. It is a word.

10:12.879 --> 10:16.830
But it's interesting, because the
character she's played here, Mrs Crabbe,

10:16.860 --> 10:20.039
is actually quite cantankerous
and sour to begin with, isn't she?

10:20.070 --> 10:24.049
Yeah. And that's what
makes her a good actress,

10:24.080 --> 10:27.679
because she's not like
that in real life, is she?

10:30.409 --> 10:33.409
She doesn't suffer fools,
put it that way.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.100
Yeah, she knows what she wants.

10:37.580 --> 10:41.509
In terms of performance,
though, another tick.

10:41.539 --> 10:43.929
Right, next up is Kelly Marsden.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.669
Who wants to talk about Kelly?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.659
Kelly Marsden stole my heart.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.220
- What, again?
- Yes.

10:50.789 --> 10:53.090
All these girls are real,
moving.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.250
I don't want to choose between
them, but we have to, right?

10:55.279 --> 10:58.480
Yes, but based on the performances
that we have all definitely seen.

10:58.509 --> 11:01.500
Absolutely. But let me
just say one thing here.

11:01.679 --> 11:05.090
You cannot judge between
this cup of coffee

11:05.120 --> 11:07.750
or this cup of coffee
or this cup of coffee.

11:07.779 --> 11:08.960
This is tea.

11:08.990 --> 11:09.950
Whatever.

11:09.980 --> 11:14.409
All I mean is all these
girls are real, moving.

11:14.730 --> 11:16.629
They're all uniquely brilliant

11:16.659 --> 11:19.070
and you cannot sit in judgment
of these performances.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.330
Of course we bloody can -
that's what we're here for.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.950
Well, there speaks a man who's
never been up for an award,

11:23.980 --> 11:25.149
- because if you had...
- Excuse me!

11:25.179 --> 11:29.000
Because if you had, you would
know to be entered into a race

11:29.029 --> 11:32.559
you did not choose to enter,
and then to lose...

11:33.049 --> 11:34.720
to Jessica Lange...

11:37.779 --> 11:39.129
Well, that hurts.

11:40.279 --> 11:41.190
Period.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.649
And I know, because when I won
Breakthrough Talent in 2003...

11:43.679 --> 11:45.389
Yeah, Clive, OK...

11:45.730 --> 11:48.580
Sorry, can I just bring
this back to the acting bit?

11:48.610 --> 11:50.950
Yes, thank you,
Jackie, please do.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.210
This Kelly girl,
she made me and my mum cry.

11:54.240 --> 11:57.240
Good. Not good, but... Carry on.

11:57.269 --> 12:01.850
She was just so moving and believable,
I totally cared what happened to her.

12:01.879 --> 12:03.779
She is definitely talented.

12:03.809 --> 12:05.570
I mean, you know, she's auditioned
for me a couple of times,

12:05.600 --> 12:08.419
not got them, obviously,
but, I think,

12:08.450 --> 12:11.129
I think this has just come a
little bit too soon for her.

12:11.159 --> 12:13.090
Is this the flat-chested one?

12:13.120 --> 12:14.470
- Didn't like it.
- Rupert!

12:14.500 --> 12:16.620
Am I not allowed an
opinion on this one either?

12:16.649 --> 12:18.659
Look, Kelly's come
up through the soaps,

12:18.690 --> 12:20.500
and I think they learn
a lot of bad habits.

12:20.529 --> 12:24.370
But, getting back to what
Gordon said, I think he's right.

12:24.399 --> 12:28.080
I think in a couple of years, we
could be looking at a Suranne Jones

12:28.110 --> 12:30.110
or a Sarah Lancashire.

12:30.139 --> 12:30.730
But not yet.

12:30.759 --> 12:33.360
I'm with Gordon on this one,
I'm afraid. I wasn't convinced.

12:33.389 --> 12:35.950
If you're going to be addicted to
gambling, live on a council estate,

12:35.980 --> 12:37.490
you've got to do more than
scrape your hair back,

12:37.519 --> 12:39.129
paint a love bite on, I'm sorry.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.179
OK, OK, so not the most
glowing comments we've had.

12:42.210 --> 12:45.450
I'm just going to put a question
mark next to Kelly for now.

12:45.659 --> 12:48.850
Finally, Anna Adeyemi,

12:48.879 --> 12:53.360
who played Trish in
Channel 4's Clickbait.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.509
Who wants to talk about her?

12:57.269 --> 12:58.470
Gordon.

13:03.129 --> 13:04.509
What are you all
looking at me for?

13:04.980 --> 13:08.690
Just because you are a director and
you may well have some thoughts on...

13:08.720 --> 13:11.210
- The black actress.
- No, no, no, not at all.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.659
She is AN actress
nominated for this award.

13:14.690 --> 13:16.529
Oh,
so it's not the coloured girl?

13:16.559 --> 13:18.480
- What did you...
- It's...

13:18.620 --> 13:22.090
The nominee we are
discussing is Anna Adeyemi.

13:22.120 --> 13:24.240
Anna Adeyemi stole my heart.

13:24.269 --> 13:25.299
I see what this is.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.629
I see what this... I now
understand why I'm on the panel.

13:27.659 --> 13:30.480
It's my unique insight
into all things black.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.879
Not at all. You are here because you
are a valued industry professional,

13:33.909 --> 13:35.529
same as everybody else.

13:36.009 --> 13:36.850
Except Jackie.

13:36.879 --> 13:38.840
Well, we have to have one,
don't we?

13:38.870 --> 13:40.000
I read it somewhere.

13:40.029 --> 13:41.659
- Isn't that right, Giles?
- No, no, no.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.429
- That's not...
- I just can't believe this.

13:43.460 --> 13:45.750
No, what I meant is,
it's a good thing.

13:45.779 --> 13:47.429
We ought to have one.

13:47.659 --> 13:50.000
Bloody hell. They damn you if
you do, damn you if you don't.

13:50.029 --> 13:50.840
Rupert, stop it now.

13:50.870 --> 13:55.330
Look, it is not my fault that Idris
Elba didn't make a TV show this year,

13:55.360 --> 13:57.860
so you can all tick your little
diversity box and have at it.

13:57.889 --> 14:01.090
- Oh, come on!
- You know what? This is bullshit.

14:02.149 --> 14:03.259
- I'm leaving.
- No, no, no.

14:03.289 --> 14:05.659
I am leaving! I'm leaving!

14:05.690 --> 14:07.710
We need you on this panel.

14:07.740 --> 14:08.940
Hear, hear.

14:16.690 --> 14:17.889
Fine.

14:18.950 --> 14:20.149
Fine, Giles.

14:21.600 --> 14:26.990
But let it be known that I do not
want to go first in this discussion.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.399
Understood.

14:29.210 --> 14:30.409
Thank you.

14:31.350 --> 14:32.549
Clive.

14:32.980 --> 14:34.820
What did you think of
Anna's performance?

14:45.659 --> 14:47.750
I think she...

14:49.450 --> 14:50.649
..Was...

14:52.230 --> 14:53.320
..Brilliant.

14:53.350 --> 14:57.190
Actually. It's a very contemporary
story, very well told.

14:58.230 --> 15:02.659
She brought great authenticity
to that world, it was fantastic.

15:04.210 --> 15:07.519
- Jackie.
- Again, really, really good.

15:08.080 --> 15:11.990
I actually couldn't
see her acting.

15:12.200 --> 15:17.370
And that really added to
the storyline, in my eyes.

15:17.610 --> 15:19.179
Well, we already know
what Paula thinks.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.350
June.

15:20.379 --> 15:21.350
I've always loved her.

15:21.379 --> 15:24.559
I've given her two
thumbs up in the past.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.039
Isn't that a
conflict-of-interest?

15:26.070 --> 15:27.830
I'd be very happy if
she got this award.

15:27.860 --> 15:29.769
Rupert,
what did you make of Anna?

15:30.110 --> 15:36.039
Truthfully, I wasn't that
impressed, I'm afraid to say.

15:36.070 --> 15:37.279
Another mumbler.

15:37.309 --> 15:42.159
I found her very wooden,
unsympathetic, woefully miscast.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.639
I'm sorry, but there it is.

15:43.669 --> 15:45.639
All right. And, er...

15:46.470 --> 15:49.409
..Finally, Gordon.

15:50.710 --> 15:54.980
I Well, I have to say
that I agree with, erm...

15:56.110 --> 15:57.309
..With Rupert.

15:58.559 --> 16:00.330
I thought she was
out of her depth.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.980
She didn't quite have
the emotional range

16:02.009 --> 16:05.850
and I felt that she fell far
short of what was required.

16:05.940 --> 16:07.779
Yep, I agree. Can see that.

16:08.230 --> 16:11.029
Wait a minute, you said you thought
she was brilliant, like, a second ago.

16:11.059 --> 16:12.700
Well,
I'm allowed to change my mind.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.299
Gordon's made some really
interesting points.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.320
And how could you say she
lacked the emotional range?

16:16.350 --> 16:17.110
She went through
the mill in this.

16:17.139 --> 16:18.789
I don't know, June.
How could you say

16:18.820 --> 16:20.809
my direction of Hotel
Babylon gave you a headache?

16:20.840 --> 16:22.769
I never said that.

16:22.799 --> 16:25.570
"Gordon Morris directs
like a toddler with ADHD

16:25.600 --> 16:27.950
and his showy camera moves 'had
me reaching for the paracetamol

16:27.980 --> 16:29.340
- in the first ten minutes."
- I think that's...

16:29.370 --> 16:32.409
Like I said, Gordon, it's water
under the bridge. It doesn't matter.

16:32.440 --> 16:35.769
Yeah... it doesn't matter, cos
nothing that you do matters, June.

16:35.799 --> 16:36.480
What's that supposed to mean?

16:36.509 --> 16:38.269
- You don't have to answer that, Gordon.
- No, I want to answer it.

16:38.299 --> 16:40.750
- Let him speak.
- You, you are a parasite.

16:40.779 --> 16:42.500
Jackie has more to
contribute than you.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.500
Leave it, honey. You only ever
remember your bad reviews.

16:45.529 --> 16:47.240
You must have a
bloody good memory.

16:47.379 --> 16:49.740
Fuck you, you withered asshole.

16:49.769 --> 16:52.389
All right, everybody,
please, let's just, er...

16:53.070 --> 16:54.419
Let's just calm down.

16:55.049 --> 16:57.470
I suggest we take a
five-minute break, come back.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.539
And, if we can, choose a winner.

17:01.490 --> 17:04.259
Just going for a
pee and a ciggy.

17:05.059 --> 17:07.230
I'm sorry about that, old chap.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.980
Crossed wires, I think.

17:09.089 --> 17:10.920
- No offence.
- It's fine.

17:18.980 --> 17:20.180
Jesus.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.509
Bit awkward, wasn't it?

17:22.539 --> 17:24.529
Yeah, he's apologised,
it's fine.

17:25.400 --> 17:30.150
Just so you know, there's going to be
lots of diversity in Blood Oranges.

17:31.210 --> 17:33.000
- Blood Oranges?
- My script.

17:33.069 --> 17:36.799
- I know you haven't read it.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, no, no, I haven't.

17:36.829 --> 17:41.259
Well, when you do, just bear in mind
that any of the characters could be...

17:43.640 --> 17:45.099
..diversified.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.450
What do you mean?

17:48.589 --> 17:51.190
Just that if there's anything you
don't like or you don't agree with,

17:51.750 --> 17:53.190
I don't mind changing it.

17:53.460 --> 17:56.059
Clive, you're not supposed to
feel that about your own script.

17:56.089 --> 17:57.990
You're supposed to
be protective of it.

17:58.019 --> 17:59.990
I want a writer that totally
believes in their work.

18:00.019 --> 18:01.000
But I am, I do.

18:01.029 --> 18:05.170
But, equally, I don't mind
completely changing it

18:05.440 --> 18:07.079
if it means it'll get made.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.740
You all right?

18:24.710 --> 18:25.910
Yes.

18:26.490 --> 18:28.589
Just having a little think.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.960
So, how did you win this
competition, Jackie?

18:32.990 --> 18:35.470
I had to write a pretend
review of a programme.

18:35.559 --> 18:36.890
what did you choose?

18:36.920 --> 18:40.589
- Bake Off.
- Oh, yeah, I reviewed that once.

18:40.809 --> 18:43.390
I did the whole thing
as if it were a recipe.

18:43.420 --> 18:46.930
Take two ripe presenters,
that sort of thing.

18:47.450 --> 18:48.650
Sounds good.

18:49.630 --> 18:51.329
I'd love to have your job.

18:51.549 --> 18:52.940
Do you enjoy it?

18:54.059 --> 18:57.940
Well,
I'm invited to every premiere.

18:58.359 --> 19:00.680
I'm at every awards ceremony.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.980
I get to walk the red
carpet alongside the stars.

19:04.089 --> 19:08.269
I get to visit the sets of
all my favourite TV shows,

19:08.299 --> 19:09.529
sitting in the corner.

19:10.869 --> 19:12.480
Watching these...

19:13.160 --> 19:14.960
..amazing things.

19:17.410 --> 19:21.180
And... I've got nothing
to do with any of it.

19:22.160 --> 19:23.359
He's right.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.759
I'm the loneliest
woman in the world.

19:27.789 --> 19:29.730
So, Paula, how's the play going?

19:29.890 --> 19:31.099
It's a piece of shit, honey.

19:31.130 --> 19:32.529
What theatre are you in?

19:32.609 --> 19:35.640
the Trafalgar Studios,
that's West End, right?

19:35.670 --> 19:37.470
Yes, technically.

19:37.829 --> 19:41.069
- Who's directing it?
- Nobody, that's the problem.

19:41.309 --> 19:42.779
But we'll get through it.

19:42.809 --> 19:44.500
That's what we do.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.369
So, um, I've just been
speaking to your agent.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.720
She said she did send through
a link to the viewing portal.

19:50.750 --> 19:51.490
That's right.

19:51.519 --> 19:54.680
She also gave you some notes
about each of the nominees.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.140
What are you getting at, Giles?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.039
Shit, or get off the pot.

19:59.069 --> 20:02.230
Just that it is a requirement, as
per the declaration you signed,

20:02.259 --> 20:05.269
that you have actually watched
the performances we're discussing.

20:05.299 --> 20:06.680
Don't worry about that.

20:06.849 --> 20:08.480
I know all these bitches.

20:08.509 --> 20:11.369
I don't know who they are,
but they're types.

20:11.910 --> 20:15.289
The star, the dame, the girl
next door, and the ingenue.

20:15.319 --> 20:18.309
- I don't think...
- Honey, I vote in the Academy Awards.

20:18.339 --> 20:21.789
I picked the best film nine
times in the past ten years,

20:21.849 --> 20:24.589
and I've never seen a
motherfucking one of those movies.

20:25.079 --> 20:26.950
So trust me, hmm?

20:28.549 --> 20:29.789
I got this.

20:31.789 --> 20:34.140
I've just bumped
into Wayne Sleep.

20:34.309 --> 20:39.150
He's on the panel for Reality and
Constructed Factual, whatever that is.

20:39.180 --> 20:39.930
I'll tell you what that is.

20:39.960 --> 20:44.319
That is a continuing drama without the
need of a scriptwriter, apparently.

20:44.349 --> 20:46.220
It's like improv,
with real people.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.029
What, you mean they give you
an award for eavesdropping?

20:49.180 --> 20:50.380
I'm afraid so, yeah.

20:51.039 --> 20:54.170
Right, well,
shall we all reconvene?

20:55.460 --> 20:57.559
I just want to remind
everybody of the categories.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.539
This is Best Performance by
an Actress in a Leading Role.

21:01.569 --> 21:03.950
Now, do we feel like we
are perhaps in a position

21:03.980 --> 21:07.079
to eliminate a couple of the candidates,
turn it into a two-horse race?

21:07.109 --> 21:10.410
Absolutely. Ditch the two younger
ones, it's too soon for them.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.950
It'll only screw
up their careers.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.190
That's the spirit, Paula.

21:13.220 --> 21:16.220
You were never one for sending
the lift back down, were you?

21:16.250 --> 21:18.309
Fuck that, they can use
the stairs, like I did.

21:18.339 --> 21:21.529
Anyone else agree that we
should lose Kelly and Anna?

21:21.859 --> 21:23.269
Anna, yes. Kelly, no.

21:23.299 --> 21:25.420
I dunno, I like them all.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.680
It's so hard, isn't it?

21:26.710 --> 21:28.730
Well, can we all at least
agree on keeping Shona?

21:28.759 --> 21:29.980
Everyone seemed to like her.

21:30.009 --> 21:34.049
Er, yes, just looking at some of
the comments, she was "truthful",

21:34.079 --> 21:37.250
it was "a remarkable performance",
someone said she stole their heart.

21:37.279 --> 21:38.779
I think we all
know who that was.

21:38.859 --> 21:41.759
Jackie said she's always
brilliant in every part she plays.

21:41.789 --> 21:43.109
Yep, again, anointed.

21:43.140 --> 21:45.799
She's brilliant in everything, she
also wins awards for everything.

21:45.829 --> 21:47.630
She won for Best Actress
last year, didn't she?

21:47.660 --> 21:49.890
She did, but that must
not affect our decision.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.839
Wait a minute,
she won last year?

21:52.119 --> 21:54.289
I didn't know that.
Well, that changes everything.

21:54.319 --> 21:56.589
Yeah, and if I remember rightly,
she was hardly in it.

21:56.619 --> 22:00.910
She won it because she's Shona Andrews
and it is completely unacceptable

22:00.940 --> 22:03.289
to not give her an award if she's
been in a programme that year.

22:03.319 --> 22:07.299
Oh come on, that's not fair, she wins
because she's an exceptional talent.

22:07.329 --> 22:09.400
I'm not denying that, but equally
my heart would sink a little bit

22:09.430 --> 22:11.759
if I was watching this on
telly and she gets up again.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.859
- He's got a point.
- I agree, it's too much.

22:13.890 --> 22:15.029
Oh, guys, this is rubbish.

22:15.059 --> 22:19.599
All I am saying is can we be the jury
that doesn't just hand the award to

22:19.630 --> 22:22.279
Shona Andrews
simply for existing?

22:22.380 --> 22:23.859
Well, let's take a vote.

22:24.029 --> 22:27.740
All those in favour of
removing Shona from the list.

22:32.920 --> 22:34.839
Well, that's a majority.

22:34.869 --> 22:37.329
Shona is off the list.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.359
Though still a very great
honour to be nominated.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.059
Right, if we could lose one
more, that would be great.

22:46.349 --> 22:49.549
let's recap what
was said about Anna.

22:50.109 --> 22:52.500
Rupert wasn't impressed,
thought she was another mumbler.

22:52.529 --> 22:55.279
Clive said she was fantastic,
great authenticity.

22:55.309 --> 22:57.029
Gordon thought she
was out of her depth.

22:57.059 --> 22:59.190
Clive then changed his mind
and agreed with Gordon.

22:59.220 --> 23:02.000
- I'm allowed.
- Yeah, she's gone, let's wrap this up.

23:02.029 --> 23:04.730
You can't hurry this, these
are such important decisions.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.660
Yeah, cos I can't wait to find
out who won Constructed Reality

23:07.690 --> 23:10.279
Right, well,
let's put it this way, then.

23:10.509 --> 23:13.509
Does anybody think Anna
gave the best performance?

23:17.089 --> 23:21.690
In that case, she's another worthy
nominee, but not our winner.

23:22.170 --> 23:24.190
So, it comes down to these two.

23:24.220 --> 23:29.579
Dame Dorothy, "A national treasure",
"Twinkly", stole Paula's heart,

23:29.609 --> 23:32.069
and Kelly also
stole Paula's heart.

23:32.099 --> 23:34.299
- They all did.
- "Very moving",

23:34.329 --> 23:37.250
"Flat-chested" -
not sure that's really relevant.

23:37.569 --> 23:40.990
A bit soapy, perhaps, but - and
this is very important, I think -

23:41.019 --> 23:43.380
she did make Jackie
and her mum cry.

23:43.410 --> 23:45.710
Well, that just about nails it,
then.

23:45.740 --> 23:49.369
So, can we take a quick show of hands,
just to get the temperature of the room?

23:49.400 --> 23:51.269
All those for Kelly.

23:54.869 --> 23:56.630
And for Dame Dorothy?

23:58.630 --> 24:00.539
So, both ladies have
three votes each.

24:00.569 --> 24:03.339
Oh, Jesus Christ,
I just requested my Uber.

24:03.369 --> 24:06.569
Can we not call them ladies,
please? It's really patronising.

24:06.599 --> 24:09.369
- What are they then, kangaroos?
- They're actors.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.269
- Well, actresses.
- I don't like that either.

24:11.299 --> 24:13.309
OK, you know what? I switch.

24:13.339 --> 24:15.140
- Sorry?
- Who did I vote for?

24:15.170 --> 24:16.599
Just change it to the other one.

24:16.630 --> 24:20.220
All right, so now it's four
to Kelly and two to Dorothy.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.849
You can't do that,
Paula, that's unfair.

24:21.880 --> 24:22.430
Watch me.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.670
Well, hold on, if she's changing to
Kelly, I'm changing to Dame Dotty.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.950
- Oh, for goodness' sake.
- So, it's back to three-all.

24:27.980 --> 24:29.549
Yes,
I switch to Dorothy as well.

24:29.579 --> 24:32.779
Now that's four to
Dorothy and two to Kelly.

24:32.809 --> 24:35.440
For God's sake, Clive, will
you stand on your own two feet?

24:35.470 --> 24:37.000
- But I'm agreeing with you.
- Well, don't.

24:37.029 --> 24:38.710
I'm not going to do your script,
OK?

24:38.740 --> 24:41.130
- What?
- Blood Oranges, I read it last night.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.730
It's just a rehash of Spooks,
it's shit.

24:42.759 --> 24:43.809
Well, which bit? I'll change it.

24:43.839 --> 24:46.480
- All of it.
- Well, I switch to Kelly, then.

24:46.589 --> 24:47.980
You have to respect the process.

24:48.009 --> 24:49.589
And it's three-all again.

24:49.619 --> 24:51.470
Can we just do the final vote,
please?

24:51.500 --> 24:53.210
Khalid is two minutes away.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.859
Why don't you just
give it to Dotty?

24:54.890 --> 24:55.920
I thought you already had.

24:55.950 --> 24:57.369
Exactly,
his vote shouldn't be counted.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.400
Oh, yes, so that's two to
Dorothy and three to Kelly.

25:00.430 --> 25:02.259
What a load of bollocks.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.859
If you don't want the professional
opinion, 50 years' experience,

25:05.890 --> 25:10.539
you may as well ask some witless
couch potato who they want to win.

25:10.569 --> 25:12.400
Well, we do have Jackie with us.

25:12.430 --> 25:16.339
Jackie, is there anything you'd
like to add to the debate?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.269
No, it's all right.

25:19.460 --> 25:21.240
Every opinion is valid.

25:21.339 --> 25:22.539
Even yours.

25:27.210 --> 25:29.970
I'm not clever like all of you.

25:31.269 --> 25:34.779
I didn't realise you had to think
about all these other outside things,

25:34.809 --> 25:39.660
like how old they are, or how
many other awards they've won...

25:40.369 --> 25:42.619
..Or who's popular
in the industry.

25:43.809 --> 25:48.329
It's not fair on the ladies -
sorry, the actors -

25:48.829 --> 25:51.279
to have someone like
me passing judgment.

25:51.990 --> 25:55.230
I think I'm just going to go and leave
you all to it, if you don't mind.

25:57.440 --> 26:01.200
I've made a fool of myself.
I'm so sorry.

26:10.190 --> 26:13.240
Well, that's what happens
when you invite the public.

26:19.569 --> 26:23.819
Right, erm, shall we dish
out the electronic devices?

26:24.630 --> 26:28.369
Remember, these will
lock in your final vote.

26:28.890 --> 26:32.250
As there are only five of you
left, there's no chance of a tie.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.410
Well, I've got to go.

26:40.990 --> 26:42.420
It's been a pleasure.

26:43.029 --> 26:44.940
If you want a lousy
night at the theatre,

26:44.970 --> 26:47.380
come to the Trafalgar
Studios next month

26:47.779 --> 26:50.609
and help me drown my sorrows
in the bar afterwards.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.289
Yes, I'd love to do that.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.200
We should swap numbers.

26:58.609 --> 27:02.089
Well, I've got a screening
to get to, so, er...

27:03.299 --> 27:04.950
Keep up the good work, everyone.

27:05.799 --> 27:07.980
Can't wait to see
what you all do next.

27:08.009 --> 27:12.450
Anyone fancy a swift debriefing session
down at the Coach and Horses? Gordon?

27:12.480 --> 27:13.640
No, thanks.

27:13.670 --> 27:16.220
If Shona Andrews passes,
let's try Kelly Marsden.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.759
I'll come. Er, I've not got
much cash on me at the moment.

27:18.789 --> 27:20.650
Typical bloody writer,
I'll treat you.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.329
There's actually a
part in Blood Oranges

27:22.359 --> 27:23.940
you would be perfect for,
if you wouldn't mind reading it.

27:23.970 --> 27:26.549
- Oh, yes? - It's a 30-year-old
Japanese woman at the moment,

27:26.579 --> 27:28.029
but I don't mind changing it...

27:52.069 --> 27:54.289
Sorry, forgot my phone.

27:54.319 --> 27:56.000
Oh, Jackie.

27:56.859 --> 27:58.920
I hope that wasn't
too bruising for you.

27:59.430 --> 28:03.160
These artistic types can be fairly
temperamental, as I'm sure you're aware.

28:03.450 --> 28:04.970
So, do you know who won?

28:05.000 --> 28:07.700
Yes,
and I think you'll be satisfied.

28:07.730 --> 28:11.279
Let's just say they voted with their
hearts rather than their heads,

28:11.309 --> 28:14.660
and part of that is down to you,
so well done.

28:15.720 --> 28:16.920
Cheerio.

28:21.559 --> 28:23.309
No, Giles.

28:41.759 --> 28:44.640
It's because I'm
the best actress.
