WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.336
Previously on medium:

00:03.337 --> 00:05.372
Joe: There were five
of us in that room.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.540
Only two of us
made it out alive.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.410
My name is Cooper Conroy.
I'm an attorney, Mr. Dubois.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.011
Can you talk for a moment?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.380
Talk about what?

00:13.381 --> 00:16.383
About millions of dollars
I believe you're entitled to.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.385
What is this?
It's a liability waiver.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.087
You're saying
if I don't sign these,

00:20.088 --> 00:22.089
I can't come back to work?

00:22.090 --> 00:22.923
Walter Paxton

00:22.924 --> 00:25.358
chopped his wife's head off

00:25.359 --> 00:27.327
and kept her head as a souvenir.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.395
We find the defendant

00:28.396 --> 00:30.863
guilty of murder
in the first degree.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.465
Scanlon: I thought
you needed to see this.

00:32.466 --> 00:36.203
It's Natalie Paxton's head
on Ramona hensley's body.

00:36.204 --> 00:38.971
Devalos: City hall's already
being inundated with people

00:38.972 --> 00:40.740
calling for the immediate
release of Walter Paxton.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.276
Allison: The woman who hit
my car, she wants to have lunch.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.011
What's it like working
for the da?

00:45.012 --> 00:46.279
I need to talk to you

00:46.280 --> 00:47.414
about a dream I just had.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.015
You said there are five victims,

00:49.016 --> 00:50.750
and you said that your friend
is victim number four.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.552
I thought about you

00:51.553 --> 00:53.686
in that hotel by yourself.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.423
Don't be concerned. There's
thousands of hotel rooms

00:56.424 --> 00:57.924
in Phoenix
and only one recapitator.

00:57.925 --> 01:01.228
Devalos gets fired after
the death of the fifth victim.

01:01.229 --> 01:04.964
I like being the new da
of Phoenix.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.433
Don't let your friend
get murdered.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.201
Stop the murder,
stop the murderer.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.736
Cheryl Ann potts, 24 years old.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.070
A maid found her

01:11.071 --> 01:12.439
in the hotel bathtub.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.374
The previous victim's head
was there as well.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.476
It was her head that ends up
on Debra's body.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.378
We can't allow it to happen.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.447
This nationalreporter,
p.D. McCall,

01:20.448 --> 01:22.449
has been writing some
pretty nasty pieces about me.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.251
Talked about some of the
work you do for us.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.085
Where would something like that
come from?

01:26.086 --> 01:27.954
Is it apparently came from you,
Allison.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.456
I don't even know a p.D. McCall.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.823
Devalos: I think maybe you do.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.091
Allison: P.D.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.561
You're not at all who
you say you are, are you?

01:34.562 --> 01:36.963
Okay, but then if you were
really the psychic

01:36.964 --> 01:39.166
you claim to be,
wouldn't you have known that?

01:39.167 --> 01:40.633
You cannot run this story.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.469
I told you things in confidence.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.571
Crazy things, Allison.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.375
I told you those things
to save your life!

01:50.878 --> 01:52.880
Joe: Hey.

01:54.482 --> 01:58.951
Allison: Baby, honey.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.487
Try not to wake your sister.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.556
Daddy and I have to talk to you.

02:03.557 --> 02:05.692
You know how we never
really told anyone

02:05.693 --> 02:07.494
about mommy's dreams?

02:07.495 --> 02:11.298
About how mommy sees things,
knows things sometimes?

02:11.299 --> 02:13.933
Well, now that this
article's in the paper,

02:13.934 --> 02:15.268
people are going to know.

02:15.269 --> 02:19.172
Some people, some people...

02:19.173 --> 02:22.275
Are going to think
that mommy's lying.

02:22.276 --> 02:26.379
And some people might even
think that mommy's crazy.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.048
And you two may hear
some of that at school

02:29.049 --> 02:30.417
and when you're out.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.953
You really think people
are going to think that?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.856
Some.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.625
So what do we do?

02:38.626 --> 02:41.528
I mean, if someone
says something bad?

02:41.529 --> 02:43.863
Well, what I'd like
you to try to do

02:43.864 --> 02:45.165
is to ignore it.

02:46.534 --> 02:51.271
I mean, we know
the truth, right?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.939
Excuse me, are you
Allison Dubois?

02:52.940 --> 02:55.575
You just pulled into her
parking space. If you'll just...

02:55.576 --> 02:57.143
Is this her? I think so.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.445
I have to get to work.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.779
Can you talk about your
relationship as

02:59.780 --> 03:01.548
a spiritual advisor
to the district attorney?

03:01.549 --> 03:03.550
Do you actually
talk to dead people?

03:03.551 --> 03:04.884
Are there any dead
people here now?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.553
Could you point them out to us?

03:06.554 --> 03:08.087
I really have to get to work.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.389
(Reporters clamoring)

03:13.594 --> 03:17.597
and brought to you by Toyota.
Moving forward.

03:17.598 --> 03:21.735
Choose any direction
as long as it's moving forward.

03:56.103 --> 03:59.038
Scanlon: The fourth victim's
name was Pamela Franklin.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.673
27 years old.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.409
Does she even look like
your reporter friend?

04:02.410 --> 04:05.044
She's not my friend.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.947
Sorry. Just curious.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.048
No, not even close.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.149
Scanlon: Speaking of which,

04:10.150 --> 04:12.852
we have removed all surveillance
and protective manpower

04:12.853 --> 04:15.054
from Ms. Livingston...
That is to say Ms. McCall...

04:15.055 --> 04:16.555
And her hotel.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.024
I mentioned it to
the deputy mayor.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.059
She's going to make sure
the press is informed.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.127
Gee, if I had known,

04:21.128 --> 04:23.996
I could have mentioned it
to the welcoming committee

04:23.997 --> 04:24.997
of reporters who greeted me

04:24.998 --> 04:26.899
in the parking garage
this morning.

04:26.900 --> 04:27.934
(Sighs)

04:27.935 --> 04:30.803
I'm sorry, you were briefing us
on victim number four.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.872
(Knock at door)

04:32.873 --> 04:34.707
Got an old friend
of yours out here.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.976
Mind if I bring him in?

04:36.977 --> 04:40.079
Devalos: Tom.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.649
Fantastic.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.285
I am so glad that you
could make this work.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.755
For you, Manny, anything.

04:48.756 --> 04:52.359
I'm not going down
like my predecessor.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.363
I like being the new d.A.
Of Phoenix.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.331
(Both chuckling)

04:58.332 --> 04:59.599
Came straight from the airport.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.200
I'd like you all to
meet an old law school

05:01.201 --> 05:03.436
buddy of mine, Tom Van dyke...
Assistant district attorney

05:03.437 --> 05:05.137
out of flagstaff
and a good friend.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.407
The governor suggested
that I bring in a new face

05:07.408 --> 05:09.909
to help, um... how'd he put it?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.911
Dissipate some of the
heat we're feeling,

05:11.912 --> 05:13.880
and Tom was the first
man I thought of.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.648
You've already met Lynn.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.116
This is detective Lee scanlon.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.150
Detective. Pleasure.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.853
And over here is Allison
Dubois from my office.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.655
I think I read about you
on the plane.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.492
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.559
(Chuckles)

05:26.560 --> 05:29.729
Actually, your
timing is perfect.

05:29.730 --> 05:32.098
Lee was just briefing us
on the tragic killing

05:32.099 --> 05:34.701
last night... a young woman
named Pamela Franklin.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.003
27, physical therapist.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.138
Where was she from?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.874
That's one of the things that's
throwing us for a bit of a loop.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.142
She isn't from
anywhere... she's local.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.243
Lived here all her life.

05:44.244 --> 05:45.578
Local? I don't get it.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.113
Then why was she
staying in a hotel?

05:47.114 --> 05:49.649
We're still trying
to figure that out.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.651
Coroner got a time of death?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.821
Almost down to the minute.

05:55.155 --> 05:55.956
Now, nobody knows this,

05:55.957 --> 05:58.558
but unlike our previous
three victims

05:58.559 --> 06:01.761
victim number four was not
completely beheaded.

06:01.762 --> 06:04.597
What does that mean,
not completely?

06:04.598 --> 06:05.965
He started the job,

06:05.966 --> 06:09.536
but a fire alarm went off
at exactly 7:17 last night.

06:09.537 --> 06:12.138
It apparently spooked
him, sent him fleeing

06:12.139 --> 06:13.740
before he could finish.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.842
He didn't happen
to leave behind...?

06:15.843 --> 06:18.044
Victim number three's head?

06:18.045 --> 06:20.781
Unfortunately not.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.885
(Bell ringing)

06:25.886 --> 06:27.353
(Phone ringing)

06:27.354 --> 06:28.855
Hi. Joe Dubois.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.023
Mr. Dubois, this is
Cooper Conroy.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.058
We met several days ago.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.994
Yes, Mr. Conroy, I know I
haven't gotten back to you.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.597
Things have actually gotten
a little more complicated

06:37.598 --> 06:39.466
with my employer.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.233
They want me to sign some papers

06:41.234 --> 06:43.369
before they'll let me
go back to work, and...

06:43.370 --> 06:44.871
I need to meet you tomorrow.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.540
Maybe at the same coffee shop,
10:00?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.208
Sure.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.643
Is everything all right?

06:50.644 --> 06:53.146
I'll see you at 10:00,
Mr. Dubois.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.188
I'm heading out.

07:04.224 --> 07:07.159
You're the last one here.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.128
You okay?

07:09.129 --> 07:12.031
I'm, uh...

07:12.032 --> 07:14.033
I'm great, actually.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.036
Really? What are you taking
and where can I get some?

07:17.037 --> 07:19.672
Allison, I do believe
I have survived

07:19.673 --> 07:24.143
the worst day of my career,
and I can't explain it, really,

07:24.144 --> 07:27.580
except to say
that people get it.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.982
The mayor gets it,
the governor gets it.

07:29.983 --> 07:32.685
Everyone understands
we make mistakes,

07:32.686 --> 07:36.255
and I find that gratifying,

07:36.256 --> 07:38.592
exhilarating.

07:39.727 --> 07:42.194
Have you checked in at home?

07:42.195 --> 07:44.897
No, it's weird.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.399
There are no reporters
camped out on the front lawn.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.235
The kids were fine at school.

07:49.236 --> 07:53.773
I guess at the end of the day,
Pamela Franklin's murder

07:53.774 --> 07:58.178
was a bigger story than you
or your oddball sidekick.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.571
â™ª â™ª

08:33.313 --> 08:34.214
(Gasps)

08:34.215 --> 08:37.116
Oh, excuse me, I didn't know
anyone was here.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.385
How did you not hear
the hair dryer?

08:40.386 --> 08:41.854
I'm sorry, I...

08:41.855 --> 08:43.956
Can you just please get out?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.758
You want me to come back later?

08:45.759 --> 08:48.629
No, I don't want you
to come back ever.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.701
Do you see this?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.903
This means do not disturb, okay?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.138
I don't care about the stupid
sheets or the towels.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.140
I don't want anyone in my room.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.909
Not with everything that's
going on around here.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.310
And when I checked in,

09:04.311 --> 09:05.778
I told you people that.

09:05.779 --> 09:06.813
I understand.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.283
Excuse me. Con permiso...

09:24.431 --> 09:26.600
(Gasps)

09:33.907 --> 09:35.242
(Sighs)

09:40.714 --> 09:43.315
Man: It's a very
generous, generous offer.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.316
Woman: May I?

09:44.317 --> 09:45.852
Yes. Thank you.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.087
This has been cleared?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.121
Mm-hmm.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.057
And that is money
you will actually see,

09:51.058 --> 09:53.626
not money you have
to fight for in a court of law

09:53.627 --> 09:55.327
for six or seven... years.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.595
(Clears throat)

09:56.596 --> 09:58.765
Sorry,

09:58.766 --> 10:02.601
I, uh, didn't realize
anyone was in here.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.336
Mr. District attorney.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.773
Manuel.

10:07.307 --> 10:11.343
Will you two just, uh,
give me a moment?

10:11.344 --> 10:13.280
Sure.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.254
I'm sorry to surprise you.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.156
That meeting came
together very quickly.

10:24.157 --> 10:28.060
I apologize if anything
looks untoward, Manny,

10:28.061 --> 10:29.829
but the mayor, the governor,

10:29.830 --> 10:31.898
everyone just felt
that the most efficient path

10:31.899 --> 10:34.366
to a quick settlement
out of court would be to put

10:34.367 --> 10:35.434
a new face...

10:35.435 --> 10:36.703
A quick settlement?

10:36.704 --> 10:38.037
What are you talking about?

10:38.038 --> 10:40.172
They're threatening to file

10:40.173 --> 10:42.541
a wrongful prosecution suit
against the city...

10:42.542 --> 10:43.810
$50 million.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.078
And I've been told to take
the lead on this.

10:46.079 --> 10:50.649
"Get out in front of it,"
so that's what I'm doing.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.185
Again, I apologize that you were
out of the loop. I...

10:53.186 --> 10:57.289
No, I certainly see the wisdom

10:57.290 --> 11:01.193
in having a new face broker
that sort of conversation. Um...

11:01.194 --> 11:03.796
I appreciate
you understanding, Manny.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.197
Well, I'd better
get back inside.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.833
We're sort
of at a delicate spot.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.335
Of course.

11:16.576 --> 11:18.245
(Rattling lock)

11:35.128 --> 11:36.396
(Sighs)

11:38.231 --> 11:39.032
Good morning.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.000
We'll see about that.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.969
You have to listen to
what I'm about to tell you.

11:42.970 --> 11:44.603
I have no interest

11:44.604 --> 11:45.872
in anything you have to say.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.506
You think the storm is over,

11:47.507 --> 11:49.575
you think the worst is past,
but you're wrong.

11:49.576 --> 11:50.810
It's only just begun.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.244
Even as we speak,
I have to believe

11:52.245 --> 11:54.580
that the people above him
are doing everything they can

11:54.581 --> 11:55.714
to isolate your boss

11:55.715 --> 11:57.283
and completely distance
themselves from you.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.685
Fine. There's going to come
a time when you're going

11:59.686 --> 12:01.420
to want to get your side
of the story out.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.255
And there's gonna be all kinds
of people vying for that story.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.958
I hope you'll think
of me. You're insane!

12:05.959 --> 12:07.459
Whatever you say.

12:07.460 --> 12:08.727
After all you've done to me,

12:08.728 --> 12:10.229
after all you've done
to my family,

12:10.230 --> 12:12.799
why would I ever speak
to you again?

12:12.800 --> 12:16.236
Come on, Allison,
I'm the devil you know.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.795
Sorry, I'm late.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.096
Not to worry.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.365
My employer, my boss
gave me this to sign.

12:46.366 --> 12:49.301
It came with
a very generous check.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.003
But the implication
was pretty clear:

12:51.004 --> 12:53.305
"If you don't sign this,
you can't come back to work."

12:53.306 --> 12:56.242
Well, then by all means,
you should sign it.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.244
I don't think you understand.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.678
It's a liability waiver
of some kind.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.313
Um, I think that if I sign this,

13:01.314 --> 13:03.049
it's going to make it
very difficult for you

13:03.050 --> 13:04.116
for you to take them to court.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.351
You might want
to take a look at it.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.319
I don't need to look at it.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.323
This woman who's helped
the d.A. Get in all this trouble,

13:11.324 --> 13:13.325
she's your wife, isn't she?

13:13.326 --> 13:16.028
Why? What does that
have to do with anything?

13:16.029 --> 13:18.430
Well, according
to these articles,

13:18.431 --> 13:21.968
she claims to talk
to dead people.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.036
Do you believe that?

13:24.037 --> 13:27.207
You believe she talks
to dead people?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.343
Actually, I do.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.345
But what does this have to...?

13:33.346 --> 13:35.582
And you'd swear to that
under oath?

13:37.584 --> 13:41.053
Mr. Dubois, for me to prevail
in this case,

13:41.054 --> 13:43.489
I have to convince a jury
to believe you,

13:43.490 --> 13:46.158
to believe in you.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.361
If before I can do that,
I have to convince them

13:49.362 --> 13:51.932
that dead people talk
to your wife...

14:00.573 --> 14:01.807
I would sign that paper.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.211
Cash that check.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.147
It was very nice
meeting you, sir.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.220
Announcer (on TV):
First pitch to him...

14:14.221 --> 14:15.654
Testing test, one, two.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.523
Testing test, one, two.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.192
(Over TV): Get the hitter
to chase that rising fastball,

14:20.193 --> 14:22.228
but the two-one pitch.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.130
Swing at the ball, hit in
the air into foul territory

14:24.131 --> 14:25.131
in shallow right.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.367
The 1-oh pitch on the way.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.069
Mr. Paxton, thank you
for coming.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.470
Oh, how could I not?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.940
You've been my greatest
supporter, my greatest defender.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.407
Just trying to get to the truth,

14:35.408 --> 14:38.044
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.412
I believe there's a book
in all of this,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.281
in everything that's happened
to you;

14:42.282 --> 14:43.882
an important one...
My publisher does, too.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.485
I was hoping
I might persuade you

14:46.486 --> 14:48.255
to collaborate.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.423
The two-one pitch.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.526
There's a swing
and a soft liner...

14:54.527 --> 14:55.661
Arizona's down by three.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.263
Tough luck for Arizona.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.432
And anyone
who has a bet on them.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.434
The shortstop will make
a nice throw over to first.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.470
I know they've frozen your bank
accounts while they hash out

15:04.471 --> 15:05.904
the details
of your wife's estate.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.439
My publisher is

15:07.440 --> 15:11.343
willing to extend their generous
advance immediately.

15:11.344 --> 15:15.114
I don't need money, Ms. McCall.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.249
Oh, well, you'll need
to live on something

15:17.250 --> 15:21.653
while you mount a suit
against the city.

15:21.654 --> 15:22.654
You know about that?

15:22.655 --> 15:24.256
I know a lot of things.

15:24.257 --> 15:27.459
Litigation can take a long time,

15:27.460 --> 15:30.496
and my sense is that
district attorney devalos

15:30.497 --> 15:32.631
is not inclined
to settle quickly.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.467
Well, I have reason to believe
that that decision

15:35.468 --> 15:38.870
will soon be out of
the district attorney's hands.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.108
I appreciate your offer,
miss McCall.

15:42.109 --> 15:46.078
I'll look forward to reading
your next article.

15:46.079 --> 15:50.383
Struck him out and now he is
just one out...

15:55.088 --> 15:57.323
I don't appreciate
your attitude, Ariel!

15:57.324 --> 15:58.524
I've had a horrible day, too.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.492
Bridgette, can you get
Marie a snack?

16:00.493 --> 16:02.595
Mommy wants to get out
of her work clothes.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.035
That must be nice.

16:09.036 --> 16:10.036
(Phone rings)

16:10.037 --> 16:11.470
It isn't.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.472
Hello.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.706
Good-bye.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.375
Who was that?

16:16.376 --> 16:18.510
Some reporter from some paper.

16:18.511 --> 16:20.712
They've been calling
all afternoon,

16:20.713 --> 16:22.114
which I really don't appreciate

16:22.115 --> 16:24.516
because I'm waiting for a call
from my boss.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.517
Your boss? Why?

16:25.518 --> 16:28.420
Have you decided whether
or not to sue?

16:28.421 --> 16:29.389
Oh, yeah.

16:29.390 --> 16:31.990
Yeah, the lawyer
made it real easy for me.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.692
Really? What'd he say?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.861
He said he was
dropping me as a client.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.130
He seemed to think that in light
of recent events,

16:38.131 --> 16:39.631
that, uh, I might have a bit

16:39.632 --> 16:42.868
of a credibility problem
with the juries.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.970
'Cause of me.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.738
(Phone rings) Hello.

16:46.739 --> 16:47.873
Good-bye.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.709
Did something else happen?
That phone all of a sudden

16:50.710 --> 16:51.743
is ringing off the hook.

16:51.744 --> 16:52.579
Yeah, something's happened.

16:52.580 --> 16:54.346
The whole world's fallen
off its axis.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.747
What does that mean?

16:55.748 --> 16:56.882
I don't know.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.850
I went to work... no devalos;
He's just not there.

16:58.851 --> 17:01.019
I can't get a straight answer
from anybody.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.454
I call his house, no answer.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.556
Turns out that his friend
they brought in to help

17:04.557 --> 17:06.492
is suddenly running the place.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.328
He sends an assistant over to me

17:09.329 --> 17:11.363
to tell me that my part-time
consulting services

17:11.364 --> 17:14.965
probably won't be needed
for the foreseeable future.

17:14.967 --> 17:17.336
Ariel hates me because some kid

17:17.337 --> 17:18.869
at school found out
that she got the highest grade

17:18.871 --> 17:21.140
on the algebra test,
and they're convinced

17:21.141 --> 17:23.575
that I got the answers from
that Morrissey kid who died

17:23.576 --> 17:25.777
in that swimming mishap
last summer.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.912
Come on.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.214
I had a dream last night,

17:28.214 --> 17:30.682
the fourth victim has
a spare head

17:30.683 --> 17:33.652
in her hotel fridge,
which would either imply

17:33.653 --> 17:36.788
that she is the killer
and killed herself or...

17:36.789 --> 17:38.324
Or?

17:38.325 --> 17:39.925
Or Debra is right,
and I'm crazy,

17:39.926 --> 17:44.063
and this whole dreaming thing
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.269
So we're not suing?

17:50.637 --> 17:52.138
No?

17:52.139 --> 17:54.340
So there's no millions,
no tens of millions.

17:54.341 --> 17:57.075
Uh, no, I'm going back
to my old job.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.944
Thousands, tens of thousands.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.612
Because of me.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.982
No, 'cause that's
the way it should be.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.185
I never really felt right

18:06.186 --> 18:09.188
in profiting from
all that death.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.824
The truth is I miss my work.

18:12.825 --> 18:16.628
Um... so I'm okay.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.697
If my boss would
only call me back.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.233
And what about devalos and your

18:21.234 --> 18:23.469
crazy dream and
your angry daughter?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.103
What are we going
to do about that?

18:25.104 --> 18:26.605
I just want to go to sleep

18:26.606 --> 18:28.174
and not wake up for 20 years.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.641
I like that.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.643
Deal with your problems head on.

18:31.644 --> 18:34.680
I'll go look in on Ariel.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.849
You get some rest.

19:07.079 --> 19:10.517
â™ª â™ª

19:25.898 --> 19:27.634
Housekeeping.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.938
Housekeeping!

19:32.939 --> 19:36.343
Can you step back please,
so I can see you?

19:39.145 --> 19:40.646
Sorry about that.

19:40.647 --> 19:43.283
I guess I'm a little paranoid
with everything on the news.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.925
You know what?
Forget about the bathroom.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.093
I'm just now running a bath.

19:55.094 --> 19:57.454
Would you mind just leaving me
towels and making up the bed?

19:58.798 --> 20:00.567
Thanks.

20:14.647 --> 20:15.615
Excuse me.

20:15.616 --> 20:17.916
I thought I told you
to just do the bed...

20:17.917 --> 20:19.951
No! (Screaming)

20:19.952 --> 20:22.422
(Gasps)

20:22.955 --> 20:24.557
(Dialing)

20:25.958 --> 20:30.729
(Phone rings)

20:30.730 --> 20:31.730
Lynn dinovi.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.732
Lynn, hi.
This is Allison Dubois.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.434
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.968
That's okay, Allison.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.937
I'm just getting home
from a task force meeting.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.339
What can I do for you?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.507
I'm looking for Lee.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.108
I can't seem
to get a hold of him

20:43.109 --> 20:45.644
you haven't seen him, have you?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.746
No. I mean,
he was at this meeting,

20:47.747 --> 20:50.549
but where he went after that?
You know Lee.

20:50.550 --> 20:51.817
Do me a favor. If you see him,

20:51.818 --> 20:54.620
will you let him know
that I need to speak with him?

20:54.621 --> 20:55.855
Will do.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.727
Perfect.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.505
Allison.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.707
I thought we were friends.

21:15.708 --> 21:18.710
I thought I could count on you...
You and devalos.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.312
I have things to tell you!

21:20.313 --> 21:21.813
I am still dreaming
about this case!

21:21.814 --> 21:23.715
Look, I understand
that Manny is in hot water.

21:23.716 --> 21:26.718
I know you're on thin ice
where you are, but...

21:26.719 --> 21:28.954
We are friends,
but it's really not smart

21:28.955 --> 21:31.122
for me to be seen
talking to you.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.024
Not here. Not now.

21:33.025 --> 21:34.259
And as for Manny...

21:34.260 --> 21:35.827
Yeah, okay,
let's talk about him.

21:35.828 --> 21:38.296
I get it.
Someone told him to stay home.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.666
But neither
of you takes my calls?

21:40.667 --> 21:43.301
Allison, Manny is on a boat
in the Gulf of Mexico fishing.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.036
He isn't taking anybody's calls!

21:45.037 --> 21:47.539
And when he comes back...
If he comes back...

21:47.540 --> 21:49.508
It'll be because
the city of Phoenix

21:49.509 --> 21:51.743
gets Walter Paxton
to sign a settlement agreement.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.712
And, hopefully, for a lot less
than $50 million!

21:53.713 --> 21:55.981
And as for you,
what do you want me to say?

21:55.982 --> 21:56.783
You're toxic!

21:56.784 --> 21:59.651
You just are! So I'm sorry.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.752
Given the way things are going,

22:00.753 --> 22:02.754
nobody wants
to hear your dreams!

22:02.755 --> 22:04.891
Nobody wants to hear
from Allison Dubois.

22:10.963 --> 22:13.366
(Sighs)

22:17.370 --> 22:19.137
All right, I'm sorry.

22:19.138 --> 22:20.972
Tell me. I want to hear it.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.173
Tell me your dream.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.910
Pamela Franklin.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.478
Victim four.

22:26.479 --> 22:29.781
I saw her
put on a maid's uniform,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.384
talk her way
into Cheryl Ann potts' room.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.952
She brought knives.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.555
She brought
victim number two's head.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.657
It doesn't make any sense.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.025
I know it doesn't
make complete sense,

22:40.026 --> 22:41.993
but it answers
a lot of questions.

22:41.994 --> 22:42.862
Like?

22:42.863 --> 22:44.730
Like how does he get
into the room?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.798
He impersonates a housekeeper.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.800
The victims let him in.

22:48.801 --> 22:51.102
And why is it we can't
figure out who he is?

22:51.103 --> 22:52.604
'Cause he isn't a he at all.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.806
That's very nice.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.975
It's... it's...
It's very interesting.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.910
But aren't you
leaving something out?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.812
I don't know
who killed Pamela Franklin.

23:00.813 --> 23:03.815
Maybe it's someone
outside this whole situation.

23:03.816 --> 23:07.085
Maybe that's why he didn't
finish chopping her head off.

23:07.086 --> 23:08.153
Maybe that's why he didn't

23:08.154 --> 23:10.155
leave behind
victim number three's head.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.823
Or you're just wrong.

23:11.824 --> 23:15.061
Like you've been on just
about every aspect of this one.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.068
Go home, Allison.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.604
Let us figure this one out
the old-fashioned way.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.708
The way we used to do it.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.625
You still interested
in talking to me?

23:46.626 --> 23:47.994
'Cause no one else is.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.433
I need you
to do something for me.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.868
I need you to change hotels.

23:56.869 --> 23:59.972
And I need you to do it now.

24:01.741 --> 24:05.076
So what's going to
happen to me this time?

24:05.077 --> 24:06.645
What?

24:06.646 --> 24:08.647
You know, I just realized

24:08.648 --> 24:10.816
that it seems like
you're always expecting a call.

24:10.817 --> 24:14.452
Oh. Yeah. Trade secret.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.187
It's also a digital recorder.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.623
I like to make sure
I have it out

24:17.624 --> 24:18.890
when I'm about to
have a conversation

24:18.891 --> 24:21.893
that might be quote-worthy.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.964
So why am I changing hotels?

24:25.965 --> 24:29.334
I had another dream last night.

24:29.335 --> 24:30.802
Of course you did.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.104
I saw the third murder.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.406
Really? You saw it?

24:35.407 --> 24:37.108
So who did it?

24:37.109 --> 24:38.376
Doesn't matter.

24:38.377 --> 24:40.579
I beg to differ, Allison.

24:40.580 --> 24:41.913
It's all that matters.

24:41.914 --> 24:43.715
No. You don't understand.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.916
I saw the third murder.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.317
I thought it was important.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.485
I went to the police.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.920
I tried telling them
about my dream.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.922
But of course,
they won't listen to me anymore.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.724
They can't listen to me anymore.

24:52.725 --> 24:54.926
I was really upset.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.128
I really started to believe
that there was no one to tell,

24:57.129 --> 24:58.930
no one that mattered.

24:58.931 --> 25:02.734
And then I realized
there was still you.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.871
And in a strange way,

25:05.872 --> 25:09.541
you're the only one
who ever really mattered anyway.

25:09.542 --> 25:14.145
Because, Debra,
you're still next.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.748
Wow.

25:16.749 --> 25:21.052
You're like a dog with a bone.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.621
Listen.

25:22.622 --> 25:23.955
Follow my reasoning.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.624
Victim number four's head

25:25.625 --> 25:27.659
was never completely severed
from her body.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.127
So the killer didn't leave

25:29.128 --> 25:31.029
victim number three's head
in its place.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.964
Which means
it's still out there.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.733
Which means
it could still be placed

25:34.734 --> 25:37.035
on your body
after the killer kills you.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.870
If you stay in this hotel...

25:38.871 --> 25:40.972
Allison, you already
made this prediction,

25:40.973 --> 25:43.875
and I'm happy to say
it didn't come true.

25:43.876 --> 25:47.178
No. I was right about everything
except for the numbers.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.547
It all still works
if you're the fifth victim.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.182
If you're next.

25:51.183 --> 25:53.118
In my dream, he said
there were five victims.

25:53.119 --> 25:56.988
I saw victim number three's head
on your body.

25:56.989 --> 26:00.025
I just assumed
it was a natural mistake,

26:00.026 --> 26:02.227
but now I have figured it out.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.729
You're next.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.130
Allison, you're not
making any sense again.

26:05.131 --> 26:07.065
If you were really
concerned about me...

26:07.066 --> 26:09.167
If you did actually
see the third killing...

26:09.168 --> 26:11.269
Wouldn't it just
be a whole lot easier

26:11.270 --> 26:14.105
to tell everyone who did it?
Who the killer is?

26:14.106 --> 26:19.845
No. Because
it wouldn't clarify anything.

26:19.846 --> 26:23.882
And actually,
I'm beginning to believe

26:23.883 --> 26:26.217
that there must be two killers.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.755
Two killers?

26:29.756 --> 26:33.358
In my dream...

26:33.359 --> 26:39.230
The person that
I saw kill Cheryl Ann potts

26:39.231 --> 26:41.232
was Pamela Franklin.

26:41.233 --> 26:45.236
Dead Pamela Franklin?

26:45.237 --> 26:46.571
The fourth victim?

26:46.572 --> 26:49.174
Which is the reason I believe
there are two killers...

26:49.175 --> 26:50.909
Pamela Franklin
and the person who killed

26:50.910 --> 26:53.411
Pamela Franklin.
Pamela Franklin.

26:53.412 --> 26:56.648
So come on. Just... just do it.

26:56.649 --> 26:58.917
Just change hotels.

26:58.918 --> 27:02.253
You really are crazier
than I thought.

27:02.254 --> 27:05.623
Truly certifiable.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.893
And you know the craziest part?

27:07.894 --> 27:10.829
You know how I absolutely know
you're out of your mind?

27:10.830 --> 27:12.831
After all I've done to you,

27:12.832 --> 27:16.201
you are still here
trying to save my life.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.703
Okay. Ooh!

27:17.704 --> 27:19.070
You're right. You know what?

27:19.071 --> 27:21.139
I'm crazy. Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
Yeah, I'm crazy.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.709
So just, you know...
Just humor me.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.510
Come on. What will happen?

27:25.511 --> 27:27.913
Nothing. You'll still be alive.

27:27.914 --> 27:29.748
I'll still be crazy.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.283
You can laugh
about the delusional lady

27:32.284 --> 27:34.786
who talked you into changing
hotel rooms in Phoenix.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.087
You can even... you can even

27:36.088 --> 27:37.422
write a chapter
of your book about it.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.290
Come on. What's the downside?

27:39.291 --> 27:41.459
I'll even help you pack.

27:41.460 --> 27:44.730
But what if I'm wrong?

27:44.731 --> 27:48.099
What if you're not delusional?

27:48.100 --> 27:53.705
No. I'm going to be as good
to you as you're being to me.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.673
I think I'm going to stay here,

27:55.674 --> 27:58.309
and let the recapitator
come and get me.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.878
I mean, think about it.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.212
If it's true... if you're right...

28:01.213 --> 28:04.249
Then it would be a
great vindication of you

28:04.250 --> 28:07.385
and everything you stand for.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.687
I owe you that.

28:09.688 --> 28:13.225
Now leave.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.995
Or I'll call the police.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.463
And I'm reasonably sure

28:18.464 --> 28:22.001
they'll listen to everything
I have to say.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.480
Hi, Elizabeth.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.648
Listen, I know that I
don't have an appointment,

28:37.649 --> 28:39.751
but I was just wondering if I
could get two minutes with him.

28:39.752 --> 28:41.119
I have these papers that
he asked me to sign.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.687
I just wanted to find out
about a couple of things.

28:42.688 --> 28:45.457
Let me stick my head in there,
see what I can do.

28:50.763 --> 28:54.065
(Sighs):
Well, this is embarrassing.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.268
I don't know how I...

28:57.269 --> 28:58.569
What?

28:58.570 --> 29:02.141
He's actually not in there...
He's off-site today.

29:04.777 --> 29:06.512
Mr. Dubois, please...

29:10.616 --> 29:12.317
Hello, Joe.

29:12.318 --> 29:15.854
Hello, Marcus.

29:15.855 --> 29:17.856
I brought your papers back.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.324
They're signed.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.759
That's all right.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.294
I'm afraid the insurance company

29:23.295 --> 29:25.931
had a change of heart about you.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.800
I know that they became nervous

29:28.801 --> 29:30.936
when you didn't sign at first.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.938
Well, what can I do
to calm them down?

29:32.939 --> 29:34.539
I'm not going to sue, Marcus,
I promise you.

29:34.540 --> 29:37.208
I just want to go back to work...
I just want things

29:37.209 --> 29:39.644
to go back to the way they were
a month ago.

29:39.645 --> 29:43.448
Joe, if I can't insure you,
I can't bring you back.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.383
Of course you can...
This is your company,

29:45.384 --> 29:47.052
I'm your employee, you know me.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.154
Yes, Joe, it is my company,

29:49.155 --> 29:52.690
but if I violate my
agreements with my insurers,

29:52.691 --> 29:55.994
I will have no company,
no government contracts,

29:55.995 --> 29:58.029
no lines of credit.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.332
300-and-some-odd people
will be out of work.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.135
I'm sorry.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.137
You're backing me
into a corner, Marcus.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.173
You see that, don't you?

30:08.174 --> 30:10.741
I mean, if you don't
bring me back,

30:10.742 --> 30:13.811
i-I'm gonna have no choice,
I have to sue you.

30:13.812 --> 30:18.017
I know... but that
we're covered for.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.586
I like having sandwiches
for dinner.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.789
I think we should always
have sandwiches for dinner.

30:24.790 --> 30:28.159
It's just funner than hot food.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.628
Ariel: Quiet, bridge.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.931
Mom and dad are thinking.

30:32.932 --> 30:35.166
(Dog barking in distance)

30:35.167 --> 30:38.603
$4,382... that's the minimum

30:38.604 --> 30:42.373
that we've got to come
up with each month.

30:42.374 --> 30:46.312
That's mortgage,
car insurance, food.

30:47.446 --> 30:51.250
$4,500... that's
the magic number.

31:01.928 --> 31:04.495
(Woman moans sensually, laughs)

31:04.496 --> 31:06.797
(Man moans)

31:06.798 --> 31:10.336
(Man and woman moaning, panting)

31:15.908 --> 31:18.110
(Both moaning)

31:20.212 --> 31:22.780
(Woman moans, laughs)

31:22.781 --> 31:25.550
(Moaning continues)

31:25.551 --> 31:27.352
(Man chuckles)

31:27.353 --> 31:30.489
(Both moaning, chuckling)

31:35.928 --> 31:37.662
(Sighs)

31:37.663 --> 31:41.367
Honey, how much am I worth?

31:43.002 --> 31:44.936
Baby...

31:44.937 --> 31:47.372
You're worth everything to me.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.007
(Laughs softly)

31:49.008 --> 31:52.078
No. I mean, money.

31:52.811 --> 31:57.182
Well... let's see.

31:57.183 --> 32:01.386
My late wife was worth about...
$88 million,

32:01.387 --> 32:06.992
so... as soon as you become
Mrs. Walter Paxton,

32:06.993 --> 32:09.962
you'll be worth 44.

32:11.797 --> 32:13.798
(Laughs)

32:13.799 --> 32:15.266
And when will that be?

32:15.267 --> 32:18.836
When will I get to be
Mrs. Walter Paxton?

32:18.837 --> 32:20.871
Well, it can't be too soon.

32:20.872 --> 32:24.475
That would be... unseemly.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.978
Do you miss her?

32:26.979 --> 32:29.414
You miss your wife?

32:29.415 --> 32:31.282
Pamela,

32:31.283 --> 32:33.351
I slit her throat,

32:33.352 --> 32:37.455
then I cut off her head
with an electric knife,

32:37.456 --> 32:41.492
and kept it in formaldehyde
for six months.

32:41.493 --> 32:46.031
If I did miss her, I'd have
no one to blame but myself,

32:46.032 --> 32:48.167
wouldn't you think?

32:49.301 --> 32:51.702
I love you, Pamela.

32:51.703 --> 32:53.838
I think that's pretty clear.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.474
I love you, too, Walter.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.176
I know.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.445
I knew it the second
you said yes,

33:00.446 --> 33:06.452
the second you said you'd kill
that woman for me, both of them.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.861
How could I say no?

33:16.862 --> 33:19.230
It was such a great plan.

33:19.231 --> 33:22.667
You kill your wife,
give her head to me,

33:22.668 --> 33:25.870
and go to jail...
But six months later,

33:25.871 --> 33:29.640
I kill a random woman and leave
your wife's head behind,

33:29.641 --> 33:32.343
so they know it
couldn't have been you,

33:32.344 --> 33:35.346
and two days later,
I do it again,

33:35.347 --> 33:37.382
just so they're sure.

33:37.383 --> 33:42.053
And then we live
happily ever after...

33:42.054 --> 33:44.355
Get married.

33:44.356 --> 33:48.359
Well, after tonight.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.128
That's right, after tonight.

33:50.129 --> 33:54.099
One more tonight.

33:54.100 --> 33:56.701
Who's the lucky lady?

33:56.702 --> 33:58.637
That would be you.

34:03.075 --> 34:06.611
(Gagging)

34:06.612 --> 34:09.348
Ask me again
how much you're worth.

34:24.096 --> 34:26.496
(Alarm blaring)

34:26.498 --> 34:28.167
(Gasps)

34:37.042 --> 34:39.110
Van dyke: Tomorrow morning,

34:39.110 --> 34:42.347
I will be convening a meeting
of every detective on the force.

34:42.348 --> 34:44.014
There's going to be
a lot of changes made

34:44.014 --> 34:45.315
in the way we do things
around here.

34:45.317 --> 34:48.319
And I just, I want to be clear.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.456
I don't see a bright future
for you here in Phoenix.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.463
Allison: Hey.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.368
Well, look who's here.

35:03.369 --> 35:06.504
Aren't you the lady who
predicted p.D. McCall's murder?

35:06.505 --> 35:08.839
Allow me to introduce myself.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.341
I'm the guy who canceled

35:10.342 --> 35:12.177
her round-the-clock protection

35:12.178 --> 35:13.544
so that your prediction
could come true.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.613
I went to look for you
at police headquarters.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.282
They said they thought
you were here.

35:17.283 --> 35:19.484
Yeah, well...

35:19.485 --> 35:21.286
This new substitute d.A.
Van dyke's

35:21.287 --> 35:24.121
taken a special shine to me.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.356
(Elevator dings)

35:25.357 --> 35:27.358
I'm heading out right now
to key his car.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.059
Youwant to come?

35:29.060 --> 35:30.361
I had another dream.

35:30.362 --> 35:32.297
Fabulous. Was I in it?

35:32.298 --> 35:33.964
More importantly,
was I employed?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.401
We were right.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.036
We were right the whole time;
It was Paxton.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.138
Walter Paxton killed his wife.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.373
His lover was Pamela Franklin.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.375
She killed all the others
to convince the world

35:44.376 --> 35:45.976
that he was innocent,
then he killed her.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.479
And I'm figuring, last night,
he killed p.D. McCall.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.381
Really? Walter Paxton?

35:50.382 --> 35:52.317
The man we already
prosecuted and released?

35:52.318 --> 35:55.220
The man who's suing the city
for $50 million?

35:55.221 --> 35:56.387
That Walter Paxton?

35:56.388 --> 35:57.988
Come on. Come on, Lee.

35:57.989 --> 36:00.391
You just admitted I was
right about p.D. McCall,

36:00.392 --> 36:02.260
and I'm telling you,
I'm right about this, too.

36:02.261 --> 36:04.028
Let's go tell that Van dyke guy.

36:04.029 --> 36:06.096
Van dick? I don't think so.

36:06.097 --> 36:08.399
You know how he's
spinning this to the press?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.435
You didn't predict it,
you inspired it.

36:10.436 --> 36:11.969
By making this crazy prediction,

36:11.970 --> 36:13.938
you gave this lunatic
a fabulous new target.

36:13.939 --> 36:16.407
And me, I'm the idiot who left
her vulnerable to the attack.

36:16.408 --> 36:18.643
I don't care
what he thinks about me.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.511
And you shouldn't care
what anybody thinks about you.

36:20.512 --> 36:21.746
We just have to get Paxton.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.514
We're not going to get Paxton,
no one is.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.749
Walter Paxton's bulletproof.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.651
At this point, nobody can
accuse him of anything.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.119
I'm telling you, if he got
caught robbing a bank tomorrow,

36:29.120 --> 36:30.388
they'd have a parade for him.

36:30.389 --> 36:32.423
He personally murdered
three people,

36:32.424 --> 36:34.325
and he helped plan the murder
of two others.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.426
That's all well and good,
Allison,

36:35.427 --> 36:36.594
but you don't have any evidence.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.062
Your dreams are not evidence.

36:38.063 --> 36:42.234
Would it be possible for you to
get me into Debra's hotel room?

36:46.137 --> 36:48.239
It's 4:45 in the morning.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.440
I need you out of here

36:49.441 --> 36:51.208
before the techies
show up again at 8:00.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.444
That shouldn't be a problem.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.779
I'm sorry to leave
you on your own,

36:54.780 --> 36:56.447
but I got to run
home and shower.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.048
My fellow incompetent detectives
and I have been summoned

36:58.049 --> 37:00.585
to the conference room at
7:00 A.M. for a what I know

37:00.586 --> 37:03.688
is gonna be a truly
inspirational ball busting.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.591
It'll be fine.

37:31.817 --> 37:34.419
Come on, Debra.

37:34.420 --> 37:36.555
Talk to me, show me something.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.894
(Cell phone rings)

37:52.371 --> 37:54.506
Hello?

38:02.548 --> 38:06.451
Debra: Is this the same case
you were working on yesterday?

38:06.452 --> 38:08.152
I'm guessing you're a lawyer.

38:08.153 --> 38:10.321
Allison: Oh, no. I didn't
actually finish law school.

38:10.322 --> 38:11.522
I work for
the district attorney...

38:11.523 --> 38:13.391
Uh, Manuel devalos.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.494
Sounds impressive.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.228
(Beep)

38:18.229 --> 38:19.530
Debra: I feel so badly for you.

38:19.531 --> 38:20.831
I feel so badly for your boss.

38:20.832 --> 38:23.534
They're just destroying
him on television.

38:23.535 --> 38:26.504
I know. I can't help but think
a lot of that's my fault.

38:26.505 --> 38:27.605
Debra: How do you mean?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.206
Allison: Before Paxton... (Beep)

38:29.207 --> 38:31.343
(Knock at door)

38:38.550 --> 38:40.551
This is a surprise.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.152
Is this a bad time?

38:42.153 --> 38:44.221
Absolutely not, no. Come in.

38:44.222 --> 38:45.691
Thanks.

38:50.095 --> 38:51.697
Excuse the mess.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.165
Forgive me; I'm
expecting a call.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.434
Can I get you a drink?

38:56.435 --> 38:58.168
A mini drink from my minibar?

38:58.169 --> 39:00.270
No, I'm good.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.507
I was, uh...

39:02.508 --> 39:04.476
Thinking about our
conversation the other day.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.013
You called it.

39:09.014 --> 39:12.050
I've only been out three
days, and already I'm broke.

39:13.919 --> 39:16.754
So I was wondering if we could
have one more conversation

39:16.755 --> 39:18.589
about that book deal.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.792
You did say something
about an advance?

39:26.665 --> 39:28.899
Would $10,000 tide you over?

39:28.900 --> 39:30.134
Mm-hmm.

39:30.135 --> 39:32.703
I think if you were willing to
sign some papers in the morning,

39:32.704 --> 39:35.305
I'm fairly sure my publisher
could come up

39:35.306 --> 39:36.607
with at least that
fairly quickly.

39:36.608 --> 39:40.145
That would be a lifesaver.

39:42.213 --> 39:45.516
So... what do you hear?

39:45.517 --> 39:49.186
Are the police any closer to
figuring out who's doing this?

39:49.187 --> 39:53.658
Well, I did hear
one really nutty theory today.

39:53.659 --> 39:55.626
But it's not going to make you
feel any better.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.394
It's pretty out there.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.564
What's that?

39:59.565 --> 40:01.131
Two killers.

40:01.132 --> 40:02.332
Two killers?

40:02.333 --> 40:04.569
(Laughing) Are you sitting down?

40:04.570 --> 40:06.637
(Laughing): Obviously you are.

40:06.638 --> 40:08.205
I can see that.

40:08.206 --> 40:09.774
Pamela Franklin

40:09.775 --> 40:12.643
and whoever killed
Pamela Franklin.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.178
Pamela Franklin?

40:14.179 --> 40:15.646
Mmm.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.649
Well, I don't get that.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.151
Why would she kill
all those people?

40:21.152 --> 40:22.653
And who's saying that?

40:22.654 --> 40:23.954
Is it the police?

40:23.955 --> 40:26.457
And who are they saying
Pamela Franklin killed,

40:26.458 --> 40:29.660
everybody except herself?

40:29.661 --> 40:30.995
No, I don't get that.

40:30.996 --> 40:35.533
I don't know if the person
who told me this even knows.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.902
And, no, it's not the police,
not really.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.104
Yeah, I think the thinking was

40:40.105 --> 40:44.174
that Pamela killed everyone
and then someone killed her.

40:44.175 --> 40:47.546
But nobody is saying
who that someone might be?

40:49.247 --> 40:52.817
And why would that woman
want to kill my wife?

40:52.818 --> 40:55.252
Well, you don't know.

40:55.253 --> 40:57.021
This may have nothing to do
with your wife.

40:57.022 --> 41:00.758
It may only be about...
The second victim.

41:00.759 --> 41:02.960
And all the other deaths
were committed

41:02.961 --> 41:04.529
to throw people off the scent.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.764
Or it could have been
about the third victim.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.232
But you know what?

41:08.233 --> 41:11.401
I haven't really given it
much thought, but the truth is

41:11.402 --> 41:14.605
women don't really
do these things,

41:14.606 --> 41:15.740
not on their own.

41:15.741 --> 41:18.909
Go into a hotel room
and cut off someone's head?

41:18.910 --> 41:20.578
No.

41:20.579 --> 41:22.412
I'm betting
when the smoke clears,

41:22.413 --> 41:25.315
if she was doing it,
she was doing it for a man.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.718
Not to sound sexist,

41:27.719 --> 41:29.453
but it's always a man.

41:29.454 --> 41:33.759
She was in love with someone,
someone she couldn't have and...

41:37.128 --> 41:38.597
And?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.035
And nothing.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.241
We have a problem.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.745
What's that?

41:54.746 --> 41:56.882
I didn't bring my tools.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.654
(Panting)

42:03.655 --> 42:04.955
(Screams)

42:04.956 --> 42:06.892
(Grunting)

42:11.062 --> 42:13.865
Don't go away.

42:21.406 --> 42:24.675
(Sobbing softly)

42:24.676 --> 42:27.244
Van dyke: All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

42:27.245 --> 42:29.780
five women are dead now...

42:29.781 --> 42:33.751
All brutally murdered
by the same sociopath.

42:33.752 --> 42:36.153
Are you embarrassed?

42:36.154 --> 42:37.788
Are you ashamed?

42:37.789 --> 42:40.758
I know I am.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.893
Our local hotels and restaurants

42:42.894 --> 42:45.395
are losing millions in revenue.

42:45.396 --> 42:47.031
Our convention center is empty.

42:47.032 --> 42:48.933
Every day brings
a new cancellation.

42:48.934 --> 42:54.005
Well, I won't have it,
not on my watch.

42:56.107 --> 42:59.810
I'm not going down
like my predecessor.

42:59.811 --> 43:03.714
I like being
the new d.A. Of Phoenix.

43:03.715 --> 43:06.351
Allison: Well, before
you get too comfortable...

43:09.520 --> 43:12.757
I would appreciate it if you
would issue an arrest warrant

43:12.758 --> 43:15.993
for Walter Paxton
in the death of p.D. McCall.

43:15.994 --> 43:18.830
Here's the evidence,
on this tape recorder.

43:25.737 --> 43:28.974
You can thank me later.

43:37.248 --> 43:41.251
and brought to you by Toyota.
Moving forward.

43:41.252 --> 43:45.255
Choose any direction
as long as it's moving forward.
