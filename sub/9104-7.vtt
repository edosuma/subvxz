&lrm;Wh-What I meant was...

04:49.920 --> 04:53.040
&lrm;did you see Ladybug yesterday?
&lrm;Isn't she amazing?

04:53.200 --> 04:55.200
&lrm;I wonder who she really is.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.200
&lrm;Up too late DJing, Nino?

04:58.360 --> 05:00.920
&lrm;Obviously, you didn't get

05:02.680 --> 05:04.360
&lrm;Alya's looking in your locker.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.000
&lrm;That's a lie, I so was not.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.720
&lrm;Give it back!

05:09.880 --> 05:11.040
&lrm;[he giggles]

05:15.360 --> 05:17.680
&lrm;Who's the little liar now?

05:20.040 --> 05:23.720
&lrm;She's guilty of invasion
&lrm;of privacy. I have proof!

05:24.080 --> 05:27.200
&lrm;What? All I did
&lrm;was take a measly photo.

05:27.680 --> 05:30.960
&lrm;I'm sorry, there's no policy
&lrm;on invasion of privacy.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.120
&lrm;Then breaking and entering.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.120
&lrm;I didn't break into her locker.
&lrm;It was open.

05:36.240 --> 05:37.560
&lrm;Nothing was stolen?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.400
&lrm;Only my very soul.

05:39.720 --> 05:41.800

&lrm;Right. An hour of detention, Alya.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.120
&lrm;Are my ears failing me?

05:56.280 --> 06:01.200

06:08.160 --> 06:09.720
&lrm;Yes, but she hardly stole...

06:10.240 --> 06:13.400
&lrm;I'm not sure that my father would agree.

06:13.560 --> 06:14.920
&lrm;[principal]
&lrm;Well...

&lrm;[clearing his throat]
&lrm;You're suspended for a week.

06:29.880 --> 06:34.080

11:52.640 --> 11:54.440
&lrm;I thought you were Ladybug.

11:54.560 --> 11:58.160
&lrm;Sorry to bust your news story.
&lrm;Next time double-check your facts.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.160
&lrm;You'll be sorry.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.440
&lrm;[Chloe yells]

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
&lrm;Alya?

12:09.600 --> 12:12.680
&lrm;Alya's been disconnected.
&lrm;I'm Lady Wifi.

12:12.840 --> 12:16.200
&lrm;Newsflash. Ladybug,
&lrm;let's find out who you really are.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.880
&lrm;[zapping]

12:19.520 --> 12:20.560
&lrm;Follow me.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.080
&lrm;[Cat Noir] What's the plan?

12:28.200 --> 12:31.920
&lrm;Her powers come from her phone.
&lrm;In the basement, there's no service.

12:32.200 --> 12:34.520
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;No service, no power. Nice one.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.920
&lrm;We have to go lower.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.880
&lrm;[Lady Wifi] I've got you, Ladybug.

12:44.080 --> 12:44.920
&lrm;[she groans]

12:46.320 --> 12:47.360
&lrm;Get ready.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.720
&lrm;What do you do
&lrm;when you're not Ladybug?

12:49.880 --> 12:50.920
&lrm;[she sighs]

12:51.400 --> 12:53.400
&lrm;We're a bit busy right now.

12:53.520 --> 12:55.280
&lrm;[fast footsteps]

12:55.840 --> 12:57.760
&lrm;She's back in the hotel.

12:57.880 --> 12:59.760
&lrm;[Cat Noir] She locked the doors.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.680
&lrm;You realize we might know
&lrm;each other in real life?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.760
&lrm;[Ladybug] I doubt it. It's locked.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.400
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Not this one.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.600
&lrm;[Ladybug] Get ready for an ambush.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.120
&lrm;One, two, three!

13:13.680 --> 13:15.720
&lrm;So much for the ambush.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.560
&lrm;[Ladybug] Follow me.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.760
&lrm;Where is she hiding?

13:23.080 --> 13:25.360
&lrm;And what's up with all these phones?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.880
&lrm;[whooshing]

13:28.040 --> 13:29.160
&lrm;[cackling]

13:32.240 --> 13:33.560
&lrm;How now brown cow?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.920
&lrm;I thought it was you she was after.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.760
&lrm;[he groans]

13:37.880 --> 13:39.080
&lrm;[yelling]

13:42.920 --> 13:45.560
&lrm;[Lady Wifi] You can't get me.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.040
&lrm;Yes, I can.

13:56.320 --> 13:57.680
&lrm;[gasping]

13:58.200 --> 14:01.160
&lrm;No, no, no.
&lrm;Hold on in there, Ladybug!

14:04.120 --> 14:06.120
&lrm;Of course, the service elevator.

14:06.960 --> 14:08.040
&lrm;[banging]

14:13.960 --> 14:15.640
&lrm;[she groans]

14:20.880 --> 14:22.000
<i>&lrm;Who is Ladybug?</i>

14:22.120 --> 14:24.880
<i>&lrm;Is she a superhero or a super-weirdo?</i>

14:25.040 --> 14:29.160
<i>&lrm;How can we trust the girl</i>
<i>&lrm;when we have no idea who she is?</i>

14:29.320 --> 14:31.120
<i>&lrm;We have the right to know.</i>

14:35.120 --> 14:36.480
&lrm;[groaning]

14:37.280 --> 14:38.680
&lrm;Why doesn't it come off?

14:38.840 --> 14:40.000
&lrm;Because it's magic?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.240
&lrm;[beeping]

14:41.400 --> 14:44.200
&lrm;[Cat Noir]
&lrm;You're out of minutes, Lady Wifi.

14:44.960 --> 14:48.560
&lrm;How romantic.
&lrm;Tomcat's come to save his lovebug.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.520
&lrm;I am not his lovebug.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.600
&lrm;We'll come back to that later.

14:52.760 --> 14:53.800
&lrm;[zapping]

14:57.560 --> 14:59.760
&lrm;[Plagg shivers]

15:01.000 --> 15:02.760
&lrm;Oh, my ring.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.560
&lrm;[Plagg pants]
&lrm;So chilly in here.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.520
&lrm;[Adrien]
&lrm;Where is it? I could use help.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.360
&lrm;[Lady Wifi]
&lrm;What am I gonna do with both of you?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.400
&lrm;[Hawk Moth]
&lrm;Get her to use her lucky charm.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.200
&lrm;She'll switch back,
&lrm;her identity will be revealed

15:18.360 --> 15:20.760
&lrm;and the Miraculous will be mine.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.680
&lrm;If you don't get him out fast,
&lrm;he'll soon be slush.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.240
&lrm;[she cackles]

15:29.760 --> 15:31.840
&lrm;Good luck with your cat-popsicle.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.520
&lrm;I have other news to cover.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.720
&lrm;[police sirens]

15:39.880 --> 15:41.000
&lrm;[Mayor] Come on!

15:41.120 --> 15:42.080
&lrm;[sobbing]

15:42.480 --> 15:44.320
&lrm;[phone rings]

15:45.080 --> 15:46.080
&lrm;[they gasp]

15:46.520 --> 15:47.880
&lrm;[Lady Wifi]
&lrm;What's up, peeps?

15:48.000 --> 15:50.680
<i>&lrm;Listen everyone. I present you</i>

15:50.800 --> 15:53.200
<i>&lrm;with an award-winning news story.</i>

15:53.600 --> 15:57.120
&lrm;[banging and panting]
&lrm;I'll get you out, Cat Noir.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.480
&lrm;[shivering]
&lrm;Take your time.

15:59.920 --> 16:04.280
&lrm;Ladybug is about to drop the bomb
&lrm;on her real identity.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.440
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:11.800 --> 16:14.360
&lrm;This better be some lucky box.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.640
&lrm;[clinking]

16:19.040 --> 16:20.600
&lrm;Of course, the microwaves.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.360
&lrm;Gotcha. Gotcha!

16:35.280 --> 16:37.480
&lrm;Come on, micro-thingies,
&lrm;jam the signal.

16:37.640 --> 16:38.960
&lrm;[fizzing]

16:40.960 --> 16:42.240
&lrm;[shivering]

16:42.800 --> 16:43.800
&lrm;[she gasps]

16:45.640 --> 16:47.200
&lrm;You OK, Cat Noir?

16:47.320 --> 16:48.360
&lrm;[bleeping]

16:48.520 --> 16:49.680
&lrm;You used your lucky charm.

16:49.960 --> 16:51.200
<i>&lrm;There's not much time.</i>

16:51.360 --> 16:52.480
&lrm;Exactly.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.520
&lrm;[Cat Noir] Zap open the door.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.120
&lrm;We can't, the microwave's busted.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.280
&lrm;[whispering]
&lrm;Here's what we'll do.

16:59.440 --> 17:00.440
&lrm;Got it.

17:01.920 --> 17:02.960
&lrm;[giggling]

17:04.599 --> 17:06.240
&lrm;What is she up to?

17:06.720 --> 17:08.560
&lrm;Don't let my Miraculous get away.

17:08.720 --> 17:09.599
&lrm;Right.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.640
&lrm;I'll jam the wifi antenna.

17:11.800 --> 17:12.680
&lrm;Good luck.

17:13.480 --> 17:14.520
&lrm;[elevator beeps]

17:17.680 --> 17:19.319
&lrm;[gasping]

17:26.119 --> 17:27.240
&lrm;[buzzing]

17:28.400 --> 17:29.400
&lrm;Here you are.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.320
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:39.280 --> 17:40.760
&lrm;Nice idea, kitty-cat

17:40.920 --> 17:43.320
&lrm;but I won't let you
&lrm;cut me off so easily.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.240
&lrm;[he groans]

17:45.880 --> 17:46.920
&lrm;[bleeping]

17:47.080 --> 17:48.760
&lrm;Hurry, Cat Noir.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.760
&lrm;No!

18:04.080 --> 18:05.840
&lrm;[yelling]

18:15.440 --> 18:16.720
&lrm;Lost the signal.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.520
&lrm;Give me that phone!

18:26.280 --> 18:27.520
&lrm;[evil laugh]

18:27.640 --> 18:29.680
&lrm;[groaning]

18:36.360 --> 18:38.080
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.640
&lrm;Time to de-evilize!

18:47.480 --> 18:48.520
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:49.960 --> 18:52.000
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.120
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:02.440 --> 19:03.480
&lrm;What?

19:04.600 --> 19:05.920
&lrm;Pound it!

19:06.400 --> 19:08.480
&lrm;Ladybug, wow... and Cat Noir!

19:08.640 --> 19:11.520
&lrm;Can I get a quick interview?
&lrm;I'll grab my phone.

19:11.640 --> 19:12.720
&lrm;[bleeping]

19:12.880 --> 19:15.000
&lrm;Gotta go.
&lrm;You've only got a minute.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.800
&lrm;So... No, where did they go?

19:19.440 --> 19:20.640
&lrm;[gasping]

19:24.440 --> 19:27.880
&lrm;Stay. I won't tell anyone
&lrm;who you are, cat's honor.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.960
&lrm;Nobody must know who we really are,
&lrm;not even us.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.000
&lrm;[whooshing]

19:42.880 --> 19:44.200
&lrm;[he sighs]

19:45.080 --> 19:46.960
&lrm;[Tikki sighs]
&lrm;That was close.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.400
&lrm;Tell me about it.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.600
&lrm;[comic music]

19:57.360 --> 20:00.120
&lrm;You were about to know
&lrm;who your love is.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.800
&lrm;What were you thinking?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.360
&lrm;That's the thing.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.120
&lrm;I wasn't thinking. I followed my heart.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.440
&lrm;Your mask will fall one day, Ladybug.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.920
&lrm;Then you'll have to hand over
&lrm;your precious Miraculous.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.280
&lrm;[Tikki]
&lrm;Is that true? You're gonna tell him?

20:17.440 --> 20:19.280
&lrm;Is that what your heart says?

20:19.400 --> 20:24.000
&lrm;Your heart tells you one thing,
&lrm;but a superhero listens to her head.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.480
&lrm;[Alya] Got it!

20:26.800 --> 20:29.480
&lrm;My new smartphone puts
&lrm;the old one to shame.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.600
&lrm;Just look at these pics.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.800
&lrm;What's with all these photos
&lrm;of Adrien?

20:35.960 --> 20:38.680
&lrm;Well... with a mask and a costume...

20:39.200 --> 20:41.440
&lrm;doesn't he look like Cat Noir?

20:41.760 --> 20:44.000
&lrm;Are you out of your mind?

20:44.160 --> 20:47.200
&lrm;He's tons more legit than Cat Noir.

20:47.320 --> 20:50.240
&lrm;I happen to think
&lrm;that Cat Noir is pretty slick.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.400
&lrm;Stop taking photos of Adrien...

20:52.560 --> 20:54.720
&lrm;unless you give them to me.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.160
&lrm;-Give it back!
&lrm;-No.

20:57.320 --> 20:59.920
&lrm;Come on, what if you drop it?

21:00.040 --> 21:02.200
&lrm;You're so clumsy.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.480
&lrm;[they giggle]

21:03.600 --> 21:06.760
&lrm;[cheerful music]

21:07.480 --> 21:10.120
&lrm;[lively music]
