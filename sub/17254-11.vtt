- Hey, Pop.
- Hey, kid. I got news.

00:07.208 --> 00:08.576
Coco left me.

00:08.609 --> 00:09.710
Turns out
she was banging her yogi.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.345
Oh, I'm sorry, Pop.

00:11.379 --> 00:12.546
(Frank)
Sorry?
I set the whole thing up.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.082
It's fine.
It's fine.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.883
Paid for her yoga retreat
to Nicaragua.

00:15.916 --> 00:17.885
Been trying to get those two
together for a year.

00:17.918 --> 00:20.388
I did it, and now I'm like
a dog off his leash.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.090
Okay, Dad.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.491
And let me tell you,
I didn't waste any time.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.093
I'm on the Tinder.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.894
Oh, okay, well,
it sounds like you're good.

00:26.927 --> 00:29.063
I'm banging my balls off!

00:29.097 --> 00:30.364
Medium rare, medium rare.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.699
I want that burger
medium rare.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.666
Are you at the OTB?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.502
Yes, I am.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.337
And you'll never believe
what horse is running today--

00:36.370 --> 00:37.505
Daddy's Revenge.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.006
How perfect is that?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.508
I got big money
on this one, kid.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.410
- And they're off!
- They're off!

00:42.443 --> 00:45.012
Go, go,
you son of a bitch, run!

00:45.045 --> 00:48.249
Spike him, spike him,
you miserable little munchkin.

00:48.282 --> 00:51.119
Hit him! Hit him like
you're wearing big boy pants!

00:51.152 --> 00:53.020
That's it!
Oh, faster, faster!

00:53.053 --> 00:55.256
Santa needs you back
at the village, yes!

00:55.289 --> 00:57.725
Go, you son of a bitch, go!
Yes!

00:57.758 --> 01:01.529
Winner! Revenge!

Hey, Frank, it's me,
Smolinski.

01:18.779 --> 01:21.715
Yeah, I don't know how comas
work, but if you can hear me,

01:21.749 --> 01:24.618
screw you and wake up,
you big shit.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.587
Nora, Johnny,
you need anything--

01:26.620 --> 01:28.222
Gary, Gary, get a plate.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.424
You just dropped mustard
on my half-dead ex-husband.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.065
How you holding up?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.168
Surreal, man.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.135
All the patients
we brought here,

01:41.169 --> 01:42.136
it's never personal.

01:42.170 --> 01:45.306
This is--I don't know.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.940
Hey, Mac said you can take
the day off tomorrow.

01:46.974 --> 01:47.908
Take as much time
as you need.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.343
Oh, no. I'm working.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.011
I sit here all day,
I'll go crazy.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.680
I came
as soon as I could.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.249
- What'd the doctor say?
- Could go either way.

01:55.283 --> 01:58.018
All right,
so we got options.

01:58.051 --> 02:00.921
(Nora)
Okay, everybody, I'm selling
squares 10 bucks a pop.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.357
We're also doing pool bets--
over/under's at three days.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.792
- Mom--
- Over/under for what?

02:04.825 --> 02:05.826
If he lives?

02:05.859 --> 02:07.661
Either way pays.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.529
[whispers] I thought
Johnny's parents were divorced.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.464
They are.

02:10.498 --> 02:13.033
There's no way an Irish woman
would miss a good death.

02:13.066 --> 02:15.269
Mom and Dad have
a complicated relationship.

02:15.303 --> 02:16.270
It's not complicated.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.938
I hate him.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.641
But if my coma bets pay off,
I'll love him.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.344
Frank, whatever you're
gonna do, do it on Wednesday.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.012
You have to be careful
what you say

02:25.045 --> 02:26.380
around a coma patient,
Mrs. Farrell.

02:26.414 --> 02:27.481
A lot of times
they can still hear

02:27.515 --> 02:28.449
what's going on around them.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.318
Listen, kid,

02:30.351 --> 02:31.952
if he knew he was dying
and we weren't taking action,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.854
he'd be pissed.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.290
Besides, I bought him a few
squares in case he comes out

02:36.324 --> 02:38.292
'cause he gave me my Johnny.

02:38.326 --> 02:39.560
And nothing else.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.467
Your dad's hospital room
is really nice, Johnny.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.337
Yeah, they're taking
really good care of him.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.074
How much does a room
like that cost?

02:54.107 --> 02:55.843
I don't know,
he's got good insurance

02:55.876 --> 02:57.511
through the fire department,
so it's pretty much covered.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.714
Good, good.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.516
Ball park, what do you think
it normally costs?

03:02.550 --> 03:05.018
Like, a night?
Six, seven?

03:05.052 --> 03:07.421
600 or 700?
Wow.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.389
6,000 or 7,000, Brian.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.691
Shut up. Shut up!

03:10.724 --> 03:13.727
That room was so tiny.

03:13.761 --> 03:16.364
Whoever set those prices
is a criminal and deserves

03:16.397 --> 03:20.000
to spend the rest of their life
in that miserable little room.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.535
I mean, did you see the view?
Of course you didn't.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.904
Because there wasn't one.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.945
'Cause I did.
I was not impressed.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.247
You took my dad's Jell-O?

Well, it looks like
you got a broken fibula,

03:37.150 --> 03:39.687

until we get some X-rays.

Wow, that music
just goes on and on, huh?

You got to listen
to that shit all day?

03:44.458 --> 03:46.527
You get used to it.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.562
Yeah, we're gonna go ahead
and put you in this air cast.

03:48.596 --> 03:49.963
It's gonna keep
everything stabilized

03:49.997 --> 03:52.132
until the doctor
can examine it.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.735
Zach, I wasn't trying
to hurt you, dude.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.203
I thought I heard
you yell "all clear."

03:56.236 --> 03:57.538
Oh, and this has nothing
to do with the fact

03:57.571 --> 03:59.206
that I've been talking
to Ashley?

03:59.239 --> 04:01.141
I'm sick of your passive
aggressive bullshit, Nate.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.643
I'm sorry she likes me more.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.077
We have common interests.
Deal with it.

Hey, hey, take it easy, buddy.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.747
Don't tell me
to take it easy.

for the first time in ages.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.384
My ex-best friend
just broke my leg.

I think I might break
my own leg

to this song all day.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.423

- Take me away now, please.

really have a chance

how much I loved them.

You know what
we got to do, T.

tell people right in the moment

how much they mean to us.

too good, I guess.

won in the sixth.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.200
I'm skipping
the early races

'cause you said that those
were all for the amateurs.

right, Dad?

Won 24 bucks,
that's sweet.

I got to think that you
would've put some money on her

'cause you always
liked the ladies.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.215

06:55.248 --> 06:57.117
Hungry Heart only paid out
4 bucks in the eighth.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.286
Probably 'cause it's a favorite.
Who bets on a favorite, huh?

tomorrow.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.063
There's a big stakes race.

a shitload of money on that.

gonna say anything at all, cool?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.730
Small comfort,
I know, but--

08:49.763 --> 08:51.064
Thanks, Cash.
I appreciate it.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.332
But I got to tell you,
I never really got

08:52.365 --> 08:53.567
that "walk towards the light"
business.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.202
Many people who have had

08:55.235 --> 08:56.904
near-death experiences
have reported seeing--

08:56.937 --> 08:59.506
I know what they say.
I'm just saying I don't get it.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.108
Folks find the idea
comforting, John.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.542
- I know I do.
- I don't.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.344
Maybe I'm a distrustful bastard,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.613
but how do we know
what's beyond that light?

09:05.646 --> 09:07.681
Okay, John.

09:07.715 --> 09:09.617
Maybe that light's leading
somewhere you don't want to go.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.118
How do you know
it's not hell?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.385
The light for hell
would be red, obviously.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.454
Would it, Stats?

09:14.487 --> 09:16.256
Wouldn't the devil try to trick
you by also using a white light?

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
He is the master of deception.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.127
You know what I don't get?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.229
If you're going to hell
for doing all these bad things

09:22.262 --> 09:23.731
and the devil
spends all his time

09:23.764 --> 09:26.033
trying to get you to do
all those bad things,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.702
then wouldn't he treat you
awesome when you got down there?

09:28.736 --> 09:30.771
God damn it, Voo, I spent
12 years of Catholic school

09:30.804 --> 09:31.805
wondering
that exact same thing.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.206
Wouldn't the devil
be like:

09:33.240 --> 09:35.609
"There he is,
that terrible son of a bitch.

09:35.643 --> 09:37.878
"You did a lot of bad shit
up there.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.647
"I want to party with you.
I'm not gonna make you burn.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.581
I'm gonna make you a margarita
and a steak"?

09:41.615 --> 09:46.219
Totally--the worse you are,
the better you'd be treated.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.255
What you don't want to do
is barely make it into hell.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.558
Oh, yeah, you do not want to be
the devil's least favorite.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.960
"Coveting?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.728
"That's how your ass
got down here?

09:54.762 --> 09:55.763
"Everybody covets.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.397
"Get your ass back upstairs

09:57.430 --> 09:59.399
until you can come back
with some real sins."

09:59.432 --> 10:03.170
Shit, bear some false witness
at least, you know?

10:03.203 --> 10:05.138
Adultery--
work with me here.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.480
Well, well, well,

10:47.514 --> 10:51.819
Johnny Farrell returns
to the scene of the crime.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.721
Hey, Monsignor Sullivan.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.189
You praying for forgiveness
for the 40 bucks you stole

10:56.223 --> 10:57.991
from the St. Vincent de Paul
box for the poor?

10:58.025 --> 11:00.660
Come on,
you never proved that.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.796
October 1993.

11:02.830 --> 11:06.033
I remember it 'cause the money
went missing the same day

11:06.066 --> 11:09.336
the Sox lost the AL Championship
to the damn Blue Jays.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.671
A Canadian team, John.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.674
And who do I see waltzing out
the side door right by the box?

11:14.708 --> 11:17.344
A lot of people had access to
that box, and it barely locked.

11:17.377 --> 11:19.079
Any kid could've jimmied
his little hand in there.

11:19.112 --> 11:21.648
Uh-huh.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.150
That money
was for the poor, John.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.985
Look, I'm not saying
I took the money,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.920
but maybe the kid that did--
and I'm just spitballing here--

11:26.954 --> 11:29.156
maybe that kid
needed a new mitt.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.991
And maybe his mom didn't have
the cash to get him one,

11:31.024 --> 11:32.860
so, you know,

11:32.893 --> 11:36.696
if you think about it,
that kid was kind of poor too.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.733
That box is for the people who
don't have food to eat, John.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.772
Listen, I heard
about your dad,

11:44.805 --> 11:48.241
and we've been praying
for him.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.878
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

11:50.911 --> 11:53.781
You know, those candles don't
work unless you put $3 in them.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.749
Oh, yeah?

11:57.985 --> 11:59.152
Oh.

12:03.957 --> 12:04.892
You have change for a 5?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.293
I do not.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.961
But I'll take the fiver.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.263
We'll consider it down payment
on the 40.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.604
Of course I took the money,
Brian,

12:17.637 --> 12:19.272
but that mitt was sweet.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.541
Rawlings, Heart of the Hide.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.710
- The Gold Glove model?
- Top of the line.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.979
I spent the entire off-season
working that thing in.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.215
Rubbing oil on it,
tied a baseball up in it.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.283
My first game back,
I made this sweet diving catch

12:30.317 --> 12:32.119
on a liner
right up the middle, oh!

12:32.152 --> 12:33.954
But then you left it on the bus
or lost it somewhere 'cause

12:33.987 --> 12:35.488
you were subconsciously trying
to punish yourself, right?

12:35.522 --> 12:37.424
Hell, no.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.425
I used that mitt all the way
up to college.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.593
Still have it.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.229
23 years, it's the longest
relationship I've ever been in.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.764
- Hmm.
- I love that mitt.

12:44.798 --> 12:45.966
We should go out
and throw sometime.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.667
- Tonight?
- Oh, no, I can't.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.069
I've got to meet my mom
at the hospital.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.238
- Want company?
- No, I'm good.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.339
'Cause we're here for you
if you need us.

12:52.372 --> 12:53.273
He knows that, Brian.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.607
Good.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.181
(Nora)
I can't count the times
I wished you dead,

13:01.214 --> 13:03.817
miserable son of a bitch.

13:03.851 --> 13:08.088
Literally can't count
the times.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.691
Let me tell you, I always
thought you'd outlive me.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.293
You were always so full
of damn life.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.594
Used to piss me off.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.097
Goddamn sparkle
in your eye

13:17.130 --> 13:18.966
just like the day
I met you,

13:18.999 --> 13:20.767
like you were still 21.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.436
I used to imagine you
outliving me.

13:23.470 --> 13:28.475
Standing over my grave, getting
cigar ashes on my headstone.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.510
Terrible.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.748
But here we are.

13:37.918 --> 13:41.454
Looks like
I'm outliving you.

13:41.488 --> 13:46.226
I spent the last 25 years
of my life hating you.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.494
25?

13:47.527 --> 13:51.498
No, at least 27.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.633
Do I regret it?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.169
Not for a second.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.838
You and I weren't always
nice to each other,

13:58.872 --> 14:01.341
but we never,
ever lied to each other.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.677
Now who am I
supposed to hate?

14:09.382 --> 14:11.051
Probably my mom.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.185
Can you believe
she's still alive,

14:12.219 --> 14:13.386
making everybody miserable?

14:17.724 --> 14:21.761
God, who sent you
these ugly carnations?

14:21.794 --> 14:23.263
[scoffs]

14:23.296 --> 14:26.233
Stink Hands,
yeah, figures.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.544
I'm sorry it didn't work out
between us, Frank.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.112
You weren't a bad guy.

14:40.380 --> 14:43.716
Kind of a bad guy.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.953
But you got better.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.058
[crying]
And I--

14:57.164 --> 14:59.066
I always loved you anyway.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.505
I'm glad you came back
into Johnny's life.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.809
Mom.

15:09.842 --> 15:11.611
Can you believe this asshole?
He's still asleep.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.285
I heard you
talking to him.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.588
Yeah, well, we're
an emotional lot, the Irish.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.589
[clears throat]

15:22.622 --> 15:23.823
Giving up on him?

15:23.856 --> 15:28.428
No, just making my peace
with him.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.563
You should too.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.966
I mean, maybe he's just waiting
around for you to tell him

15:33.000 --> 15:35.102
it's all right
for him to go.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.836
And I'm not saying that

15:36.869 --> 15:39.606
just 'cause I had him going
today in the pool.

15:39.639 --> 15:43.943
Although that would be
a nice parting gift!

15:43.977 --> 15:46.446
I don't know
what to say.

15:46.479 --> 15:47.947
You'll think of something.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.652
Thanks.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.629
[clears throat]

16:08.401 --> 16:09.636
[sighs]

16:14.807 --> 16:18.878
Okay, Dad, um,
we love you.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.015
You've been a good dad.

16:22.049 --> 16:25.185
You've been an--
You've been an okay dad.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.986
On a scale of one to ten,

16:27.020 --> 16:30.990
I'd say you were a six--
you were a five.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.492
Um...

16:34.727 --> 16:37.497
But look, last year,
you really made a comeback.

16:37.530 --> 16:40.533
I mean, you were--

16:40.567 --> 16:42.435
you were almost an eight.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.075
But I get it.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.477
You saved people's lives

16:50.510 --> 16:52.412
for a living.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.051
I always admired that.

16:58.085 --> 17:01.254
You'd walk into a burning
building, save your worst enemy.

17:02.889 --> 17:07.094
Time to save yourself now,
Dad.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.961
Okay?

17:11.098 --> 17:13.533
Walk into the light.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.104
It's okay.
Don't worry about us.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.772
We're gonna be fine.

17:21.941 --> 17:24.311
You don't have to suffer.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.882
You did your job.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.751
Take care of yourself, Pop.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.957
I love you.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.761
Walk into the light.

17:52.004 --> 17:53.940
Bye.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.992
So you know
if your dad could talk right now

18:13.025 --> 18:16.229
he'd tell you you were acting
like a big pussy?

18:16.263 --> 18:17.397
Thanks, Mom.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.266
- I love you.
- Love you too.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.942
You did good, man.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.512
No matter what happens, you'll
know you did right by your dad.

18:32.545 --> 18:33.846
I don't even know
if he could hear me,

18:33.880 --> 18:35.182
but I guess
it needed to be said, right?

18:35.215 --> 18:37.284
Johnny,
I'm so proud of you.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.619
Being able to cry in front of
your dad like that, that's huge.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.789
Who told you I cried?

18:42.822 --> 18:43.856
Hank.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.592
Your mom ratted you out, bro.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
She was taking prop bets
on whether or not you'd cry.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.697
She lost big
on that one.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.964
You got a big mouth.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.966
I'm serious.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.303
I really do think that this is
a big step for you, Johnny.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.671
Life is so much richer
when you allow yourself

18:58.705 --> 18:59.672
to tap
into some vulnerability.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.441
Do yourself a favor.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.543
When you get home,
turn on the Hallmark Channel.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.678
Just live in it
for a few hours.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.979
Brian, just stop,
all right?

19:07.013 --> 19:10.617
- All right, but I just think--
- Brian.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.084
Oh, shit,
that's Dad's room.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.390
[laughter]
- [sighs] Dad.

19:17.424 --> 19:20.026
- You!
- [sighs]

19:20.059 --> 19:21.328
You told me to go
into the light.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.630
- What?
- Oh, yeah. There was a light.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.665
I almost walked right
into the goddamn thing,

19:25.698 --> 19:27.300
you ungrateful little shit.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.901
You wanted me dead.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.403
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.372
And I'm a freaking five?

19:32.405 --> 19:33.806
I said
you were making a comeback.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.174
I'm a goddamn ten.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.344
[sighs]
I'm just--

19:37.377 --> 19:39.078
I'm just glad you're alive.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.580
I know you are, kid.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.482
I'm just breaking your balls.
[laughs]

19:42.515 --> 19:44.317
Look at this.
I've been up ten minutes.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.885
Already my Tinder
is blowing up.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.487
Yeah, all right.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.522
- How do you feel, Mr. Farrell?
- Never better.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.359
These comas are a dynamite way
to catch up on your sleep.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.227
I might need another one
in a couple of months.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.496
Being single is exhausting.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.064
Oh, guys, check this shit out.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.932
I woke up
holding a winning ticket.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.868
Daddy's Revenge, 20 grand!

20:01.901 --> 20:03.035
Oh!

20:03.069 --> 20:04.871
- God damn it!
- Oh.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.706
I knew you'd outlive me.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.875
I'm invincible, sweetheart.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.710
All right,
let's see who won the pool.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.078
When did you wake up?

20:12.111 --> 20:15.081
Uh, let's call it 11:20.

20:15.114 --> 20:16.616
[laughs]
That's my square!

20:16.649 --> 20:17.750
250 bucks!

20:17.784 --> 20:19.552
I love you, Frank.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.020
I love you too, dollface.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.289
Five minutes off.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.623
You bet on my dad's death?

20:23.656 --> 20:24.791
- You didn't?
- [sighs]

20:24.824 --> 20:26.393
Ah, baby,
you won the over/unders.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.427
100 bucks.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.061
Everybody's a winner.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.398
Stink Hand, watch the door.
Daddy needs a cigar.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.132
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, for God's sakes, Frank.

20:33.165 --> 20:35.034
No, no, Dad, Dad, Dad, come on.
I think--

20:35.067 --> 20:37.637
Why don't you just order
Italian beef while you're at it?

20:37.670 --> 20:40.239
- Jesus, Frank.
- That's a good idea, honey.

20:40.273 --> 20:43.310
[humming carousel music]

20:43.343 --> 20:45.312
W--

20:45.345 --> 20:47.714
Jesus Christ, I can't get that
goddamn song out of my head.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.516
It's so catchy.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.294
Okay, we're even.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.663
No, no.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.197
Oh, shit.

21:07.867 --> 21:08.901
No.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.737
I don't believe it.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.439
Again, Johnny?

21:12.472 --> 21:13.840
No, Monsignor,
this is not what it looks like.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.609
It never is.

21:16.643 --> 21:19.346
Can I get a little help here?

21:19.379 --> 21:21.914
- Nope.
- Where are you going?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.483
No, Monsignor.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.352
No, but my hand is--

21:25.385 --> 21:27.920
No, please.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.522
No, come on.
