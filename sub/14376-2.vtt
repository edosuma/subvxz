Ok, ok.
Thank you, dear.

16:38.266 --> 16:40.050
But I want to press
the button.

16:40.083 --> 16:45.400
Just as I thought.
I will have to make
myself an assistant.

16:47.366 --> 16:52.116
I've got the brain.
Now for someone
to put it in.

16:52.150 --> 16:54.066
No, no. Too small.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.133
No, no.
Not at all.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.083
No, no. Too big.

16:58.116 --> 17:02.100
Oh, no. I must be
flipping my wig.

17:02.133 --> 17:05.166
I will use Dee Dee.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.133
Hmm...

17:25.416 --> 17:26.383
Whew!

17:26.416 --> 17:31.183
And now to start
the synapses firing.

17:45.016 --> 17:49.033
It appears that
your brain transplant
was successful.

17:49.066 --> 17:51.266
Congratulations,
Dexter.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.183
Eureka! It worked.

17:53.216 --> 17:54.433
And now,
my dear assistant,

17:54.466 --> 17:58.050
it is time for
the final run-through.

17:58.266 --> 18:00.266
Dexter: Dee Dee,
are you ready?

18:00.300 --> 18:03.466
Dee Dee: Dexter, I don't
think this will work.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.300
Quiet with
your foolishness!

18:05.333 --> 18:07.250
Just press
the button.

18:07.283 --> 18:09.000
Ok.

18:09.033 --> 18:11.133
Computer, engage
test sequence.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.050
Computer: Engage
josular switch.

18:13.083 --> 18:15.116
Release transputic
pressure.

18:15.150 --> 18:22.116
Press spectro button
in 10...9...8...7...

18:22.150 --> 18:25.150
6...5...4...

18:25.183 --> 18:26.283
Press it!

18:26.316 --> 18:29.050
2...1...

18:29.083 --> 18:30.333
Sequence engaged.

18:30.366 --> 18:32.366
It's working!

18:33.250 --> 18:37.016
Wait. S-S-Something
is wrong!

18:37.316 --> 18:41.133
Computer:
Experiment terminated.

18:41.166 --> 18:44.466
I'm sorry, Dexter,
but according to
my calculations,

18:45.000 --> 18:46.383
your calculations
were incorrect,

18:46.416 --> 18:50.366
but I will kindly
guide you to the problem.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.316
Computer, lights on.

18:52.350 --> 18:54.433
This way, Dexter.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.083
Nobody commands
my computer.

18:58.116 --> 19:01.133
Computer,
lights off!

19:04.016 --> 19:05.233
Easy...

19:05.266 --> 19:06.383
Easy...

19:06.416 --> 19:08.100
Dexter, I wouldn't--

19:08.133 --> 19:09.150
quiet, woman!

19:09.183 --> 19:11.050
But that's not
going to--

19:11.083 --> 19:12.266
assistant?

19:12.300 --> 19:13.300
Yes?

19:13.333 --> 19:15.416
Will you please
assist me

19:15.450 --> 19:17.283
by shutting up?

19:17.316 --> 19:20.083
You are interrupting
science.

19:20.116 --> 19:23.483
It takes
a steady hand.

19:25.433 --> 19:27.216
My hair is on fire!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.333
My hair is on fire!

19:28.366 --> 19:30.116
My hair is on fire!

19:30.150 --> 19:32.116
My hair is...

19:33.416 --> 19:35.216
There, there, Dexter.

19:35.250 --> 19:39.016
You can use my
hair-restoring formula.

19:39.050 --> 19:42.000
Rrrr!

19:51.466 --> 19:55.166
Hmm...this must be
the wire i--

19:55.200 --> 19:57.216
Dee Dee: Ahem.

20:01.216 --> 20:03.183
[Clearing throat]
Wrong.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.483
Take note,
dear assistant.

20:07.016 --> 20:08.416
By simple process
of elimination,

20:08.450 --> 20:11.416
I have
disregarded that
which is wrong,

20:11.450 --> 20:15.433
and I am left with
that which is right.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.133
How could
this happen?

20:19.166 --> 20:20.400
To put it simply,
Dexter,

20:20.433 --> 20:24.050
the right answer is that
they were all wrong.

20:24.083 --> 20:27.266
How dare you
interfere with
my computations?

20:27.300 --> 20:29.316
I created you.

20:29.350 --> 20:31.350
I command you!

20:31.383 --> 20:32.433
That's it, Dexter.

20:32.466 --> 20:36.066
I'm far too intelligent
to lower myself

20:36.100 --> 20:37.366
to your
incompetent level,

20:37.400 --> 20:39.183
but here is an assistant

20:39.216 --> 20:42.133
more suitable
to your needs.

20:42.166 --> 20:45.216
Good-bye, Dexter!

20:45.250 --> 20:49.100
You won't question
my computations.

20:49.133 --> 20:50.200
Will you?

20:50.233 --> 20:52.466
Announcer: The competition's
been unusually close

20:53.000 --> 20:55.166
at this year's
annual science fair,

20:55.200 --> 20:58.150
but the judges
finally made their choice.

20:58.183 --> 21:00.300
The winner is...

21:00.333 --> 21:03.000
Dee Dee!

21:03.033 --> 21:06.016
Woman:
Oh, splendid!

21:07.016 --> 21:09.100
Rrrr!

21:09.133 --> 21:12.433
This is all your fault!
