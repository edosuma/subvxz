We never would have mentioned
it, really, to anybody.

You certainly wouldn't have

43:16.803 --> 43:20.014
written a fucking book about it.

43:22.183 --> 43:24.227
And if we had mentioned it,

I would have been given credit
for standing by you.

you want me to say.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.842
that you're not at
Whitney's wedding right now.

44:37.925 --> 44:40.678
And it does feel like
a familiar pattern between us

44:40.761 --> 44:42.555
where I get exiled
and you come rescue me.

44:42.638 --> 44:45.224
And we know how that ends.
Don't we?

44:48.728 --> 44:50.271

you've got a pathology

44:50.354 --> 44:52.732

with you.

44:55.735 --> 44:59.530
But even if we do
love each other, it...

we're good for each other.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.545
"good for each other"?

45:14.629 --> 45:16.756
Well, I think certain couples

45:16.839 --> 45:19.300
have hurt each other less
than we have.

45:23.429 --> 45:25.723

than we have, too.

True.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.785
I mean, what's the endgame here?

We're just supposed to get old
and lose our‐our...

45:48.746 --> 45:51.374
hearing and our hair...

45:51.457 --> 45:54.335
our memory, and then we die?

45:56.212 --> 45:59.048
I guess so.

46:06.097 --> 46:08.599
You know, I know the story
I'm supposed to tell

46:08.683 --> 46:12.311
is that this all happened
for a reason and that...

46:12.395 --> 46:14.981
I'm stronger now
because of what happened,

46:15.064 --> 46:18.359
and so I'm better now

46:18.442 --> 46:19.568
than I was
when we were together.

46:19.652 --> 46:23.489
And most of the time, I do
really believe that that's true.

46:25.783 --> 46:29.787
But some days
when I'm feeling really...

46:31.622 --> 46:34.041
...sad or really happy...

46:36.752 --> 46:40.715
And I just think about how
we're not here for long at all.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.050
And when we're gone,
we're gone forever.

46:48.431 --> 46:51.267
Those are the days
I just forget to remember

46:51.350 --> 46:53.311
that it all happened
for the best.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.866
Um, he promised
to be nice to her,

47:48.949 --> 47:52.161
and then she promised
to be nice to him.

47:52.244 --> 47:53.662
‐Mm, that's good.
‐Yeah.

47:53.746 --> 47:56.248
That should keep them going
for the first six months.

the same mistakes we did.

49:29.800 --> 49:32.011
Yeah.

49:32.928 --> 49:34.054
Is everything all right?

49:35.681 --> 49:37.516
What?

49:37.600 --> 49:39.685
You seem a little sad.

49:39.768 --> 49:42.062
I'm always like this.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.357
Oh, that's a good book.

49:45.441 --> 49:47.401
I'm reading that myself.

49:47.485 --> 49:48.903
Yeah, it's okay.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.197
You don't like it?

49:51.280 --> 49:54.033
I'm sort of loosely connected
to the author,

49:54.116 --> 49:56.827
so I have a kind of weird
perspective on it.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.370
Really?

49:58.454 --> 50:00.581
What's that?

50:04.001 --> 50:05.961
Are you this curious
with everyone who comes in here?

50:06.045 --> 50:10.299
Well, I don't have
many customers anymore.

50:10.382 --> 50:12.510
You're my first this week.

50:15.596 --> 50:19.350
Look, I have
a big decision to make,

50:19.433 --> 50:21.727
so if you don't mind,

50:21.810 --> 50:24.230
I'd like to be alone.

50:27.483 --> 50:28.275
Well, be brave.

50:30.277 --> 50:30.819
What?

50:30.903 --> 50:34.073
Make the difficult choice.

50:34.990 --> 50:37.117
I wasn't actually asking
for your advice.

50:37.201 --> 50:39.787
Well, I'm offering it anyway.

50:41.956 --> 50:45.459
The universe rewards courage.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.586
Mister, I just found out

50:47.670 --> 50:49.338
that my mom's boyfriend
murdered her

50:49.421 --> 50:50.756
30 years ago and
got away with it,

50:50.839 --> 50:53.092
so I don't need
your fucking advice.

50:53.968 --> 50:55.678

51:48.939 --> 51:49.815
I took my bracelet off.

51:52.526 --> 51:53.652
I left it at a restaurant.

when I first got there.

52:37.154 --> 52:38.572
Didn't look at it.

52:38.656 --> 52:42.743
And apparently
I admitted to being mental.

52:42.826 --> 52:44.286
What?

52:44.370 --> 52:46.538
So when I brought
the police back,

52:46.622 --> 52:48.082
he showed them the release
and played them a recording

52:48.165 --> 52:50.417
of me saying
I wanted to kill him.

And after they divorced,

Helen was like a

thing as forgiveness.

but there are certain people
who are actually capable of it.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.649

58:20.956 --> 58:22.666

58:22.749 --> 58:25.961
because we shared
a certain history.

58:26.044 --> 58:26.962
Because I thought
you might be able

58:27.045 --> 58:28.714

and I might be able

58:28.797 --> 58:29.881

58:29.965 --> 58:32.217
‐Is that such a crime?

58:32.300 --> 58:33.593
‐No.
‐And I wanted to tell you.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.554
I was going to, but...

58:35.637 --> 58:38.056
you were just always dealing

‐EJ, this isn't right.

Yes, you will.

maybe not tomorrow,

Hey, Noah.

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:19.551
Your father knew.

1:01:19.634 --> 1:01:21.469
Knew what?

1:01:21.553 --> 1:01:24.180
He always said
Ben must have killed her.

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:27.851
'Cause she would never
have chosen to leave you.

1:01:27.934 --> 1:01:29.311
My dad said that?

1:01:29.394 --> 1:01:31.271
That surprises you?

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:34.232
Um, a little, actually.

1:01:34.316 --> 1:01:37.777
He spent his entire life

1:01:37.861 --> 1:01:39.529
Well, what did he tell you?

1:01:39.613 --> 1:01:42.449
That she was crazy.

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:45.243
That he tried to save her
and he couldn't.

1:01:45.327 --> 1:01:47.871
And that we were
better off without her.

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:49.789
Oh, wow.

1:01:49.873 --> 1:01:51.791

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:06.890

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:11.227

under the circumstances,

1:02:14.898 --> 1:02:16.858

How long have you

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:24.115
I moved back here after
my oldest daughter's wedding,

1:02:24.199 --> 1:02:26.534
which was 30 years ago now.

1:02:26.618 --> 1:02:29.871
‐That's when we left.
‐I know.

1:02:29.955 --> 1:02:32.457
And the day Cole
came back into town,

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:34.167
he walked through
that door and...

1:02:34.250 --> 1:02:35.293

But when I'm with them,
I can't...

1:03:31.766 --> 1:03:34.060
I can't even hold them

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:40.400
I have this friend who's a, uh,

1:03:40.483 --> 1:03:44.154
he's an epigeneticist.

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:45.864
And he has a theory

1:03:45.947 --> 1:03:48.241
about trauma being passed down.

1:03:48.324 --> 1:03:50.535
What's his name?

1:03:50.618 --> 1:03:52.328
Uh, Eddie. He's like a,

1:03:52.412 --> 1:03:54.247
he's kind of like
a‐a nephew of mine.

1:03:54.330 --> 1:03:56.750
Fascinating.

1:03:56.833 --> 1:03:57.959
‐Go on.
‐Well, he says that trauma

1:03:58.043 --> 1:04:02.756
can be passed from one
generation to another.

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:04.966
That it actually changes
the DNA.

1:04:05.050 --> 1:04:08.845
And he says there
are studies where, uh,

1:04:08.928 --> 1:04:13.224
where there are rats who...

1:04:14.517 --> 1:04:16.269
...who are shocked

1:04:16.352 --> 1:04:20.815
every time they, uh,
smell cherry blossom.

1:04:20.899 --> 1:04:22.817
And then they breed the rats

1:04:22.901 --> 1:04:27.572
and their babies are afraid
of cherry blossom.

1:04:27.655 --> 1:04:28.782
Wow. Amazing.

1:04:28.865 --> 1:04:31.284
Anyway, my point is
that your parents

1:04:31.367 --> 1:04:32.077
went through
a lot of trauma.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:35.663
They, I mean,
they lost a child.

1:04:35.747 --> 1:04:37.248
So it would make sense
that you, too,

1:04:37.332 --> 1:04:39.209
were afraid of loss.

1:04:40.668 --> 1:04:43.755
And maybe even a bit
paralyzed by it.

1:04:43.838 --> 1:04:45.757
Yeah, no, I know a bit
about that theory.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:47.300
There's a question
about whether the children

1:04:47.383 --> 1:04:50.261
of trauma survivors
also inherit their resilience.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:52.889
Oh, I didn't know that.

1:04:52.972 --> 1:04:54.766
That's wonderful.

1:04:54.849 --> 1:04:56.726
So maybe you inherited
her resilience

1:04:56.810 --> 1:04:57.644
as well.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:04:59.979
You mean his resilience.

1:05:00.063 --> 1:05:02.190
No, no, no, I mean hers.

1:05:02.273 --> 1:05:05.610
No. No offense to Cole,
but he‐he never changed.

1:05:05.693 --> 1:05:07.028
I mean, your mother always said

1:05:07.112 --> 1:05:10.115
that Cole used to run away
from his problems.

1:05:10.198 --> 1:05:11.908
But Alison, she was
always working on herself.

1:05:11.991 --> 1:05:14.452
She was a work in progress
and she knew it.

1:05:14.536 --> 1:05:17.789
She was so present.

1:05:17.872 --> 1:05:22.627
Feeling everything
so deeply and...

1:05:22.710 --> 1:05:25.505
She made herself stay awake
and was so disappointed

1:05:25.588 --> 1:05:28.550
when other people seem

1:05:28.633 --> 1:05:32.262
so asleep in their lives.

1:05:32.345 --> 1:05:35.723
Noah, when I was four years old,

1:05:35.807 --> 1:05:39.352
she dumped me on Cole and
Luisa's doorstep and took off.

1:05:39.435 --> 1:05:41.271
To get help.

1:05:41.354 --> 1:05:43.314
And then, six months later,
she came back

1:05:43.398 --> 1:05:45.191
and she fought
your father in court.

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:45.817
No, she didn't.

1:05:45.900 --> 1:05:48.319
You‐you don't know this?

1:05:48.403 --> 1:05:51.489
I thought they just
let her have me back

1:05:51.573 --> 1:05:53.575
because they felt sorry for her.

1:05:53.658 --> 1:05:55.243
No, Joanie, no, no.

Cole and Luisa tried
to keep you from her.

1:05:57.745 --> 1:06:00.540
She had
to humiliate herself.

1:06:00.623 --> 1:06:03.543

you know this:

Everything she did,
she did for you.

She tried to get help so that
she could be there for you.

1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:26.024
She was trying to give you
a better life than she had,

1:06:26.107 --> 1:06:28.776
and she was succeeding.

1:06:30.945 --> 1:06:35.325

she's one of the only people

1:06:35.408 --> 1:06:36.826

managed to change.

1:06:40.205 --> 1:06:44.334
When I met her, she was
this shell of a person,

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:46.711

she had a job

achieve that?

married men.
