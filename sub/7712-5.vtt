(Michael)
WE ARE MAKING A COMMERCIAL

00:05.573 --> 00:07.075
FOR DUNDER MIFFLIN TODAY.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.176
OUR FIRST AD EVER.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.578
CORPORATE PURCHASED
SOME AIRTIME IN LOCAL MARKETS

00:10.611 --> 00:12.646
TO SPREAD THE WORD
ABOUT DUNDER MIFFLIN INFINITY,

00:12.680 --> 00:16.284
AND THEY ARE EVEN SENDING UP
A PROFESSIONAL AD COMPANY

00:16.317 --> 00:17.551
TO HELP US MAKE IT LATER,

00:17.585 --> 00:21.089
SO IT'S, UH, NOT TOO SHABBY.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.523
BEST AD EVER?

00:22.556 --> 00:24.458
* GIMME A BREAK

00:24.492 --> 00:25.326
* GIMME A BREAK

00:25.359 --> 00:27.728
* BREAK ME OFF A PIECE
OF THAT-- *

00:30.864 --> 00:33.201
I AM TOTALLY BLANKING.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.268
WHAT IS THE THING?

00:34.302 --> 00:35.469
NOBODY TELL HIM!

00:35.503 --> 00:37.238
WHAT?
NO--WHY?

00:37.271 --> 00:38.539
YOU GOT IT.
YOU'RE SO CLOSE.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.141
* BREAK ME OFF A PIECE

* PIECE OF THAT CHRYSLER CAR

00:51.485 --> 00:52.786

00:52.820 --> 00:54.322
IT'S FOOTBALL CREAM.
IT'S FOOTBALL CREAM.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.789
ALL RIGHT, SO ANYBODY ELSE?

00:55.823 --> 00:58.159
I'M TAKING
A COMPUTER ANIMATION CLASS,

00:58.192 --> 00:59.493
SO I COULD TRY TO DO
A LOGO.

00:59.527 --> 01:00.694
LOOK AT THAT.

01:00.728 --> 01:01.762
EVEN THE RECEPTIONIST
IS GETTING IN

01:01.795 --> 01:03.164
ON THE CREATIVITY.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.332
VERY GOOD.
VERY GOOD.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.399
HELLO, HELLO.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.635
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

01:07.668 --> 01:08.802
HEY, MICHAEL.
REGIONAL MANAGER.

01:08.836 --> 01:09.603
HI, MICHAEL.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.739
EXCITED TO TALK IDEAS.
US TOO, MAN.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.874
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WANT THIS TO BE CUTTING EDGE.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.844
I WANT IT TO BE FAST,
QUICK CUTS, YOU KNOW?

01:16.877 --> 01:20.714
YOUTHFUL, SORT OF
A MTV ON CRACK KIND OF THING.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.250
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.

01:22.283 --> 01:24.218
WELL, THIS IS WHAT
WE HAVE TO WORK WITH.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.219
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO MEET

01:25.253 --> 01:26.720
ANDREW BERNARD.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.889
THE 'NARD DOG.
WHO LET THE 'NARD DOG OUT?

01:28.922 --> 01:31.592
HOO HOO
HOO-HOO!

01:31.625 --> 01:33.194
HE GIVES THE BEST BACK RUBS
IN THE OFFICE.

01:33.227 --> 01:34.562
(Andrew)
THAT'S TRUE.
I GIVE A MEAN BACK RUB.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.464
I ALSO DO GOOD AROMATHERAPY.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.166
[makes raspberry]
NOT!

01:38.199 --> 01:40.834
YOU JUST GOT
'NARD DOGGED!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.703
NOW THIS GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE

01:42.736 --> 01:45.139
IS THE KEY TO OUR URBAN VIBE.

01:45.173 --> 01:46.340
URBAN?

01:46.374 --> 01:47.908
(Stanley)
I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.744
WHAT ABOUT ME
SEEMS URBAN TO YOU?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.613
STANLEY IS HILARIOUS.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.648
PHYLLIS IS LIKE
OUR MRS. BUTTERWORTH.

01:54.682 --> 01:58.519
KIND OF A LESS URBAN
AUNT JEMIMA.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.388
THESE ARE OUR ACCOUNTANTS.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.190
AND AS YOU CAN SEE,

02:02.223 --> 02:04.925
THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT SIZES.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.827
WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO

02:06.860 --> 02:11.299
IS KIND OF A PAPA BEAR,
MAMA BEAR, BABY BEAR THING.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.466
THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF FUN.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.667
MAMA BEAR.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.668
(Michael)
WHO ELSE?

02:14.702 --> 02:15.903
I THINK IT'S GREAT

02:15.936 --> 02:17.371
THAT THE COMPANY'S MAKING
A COMMERCIAL.

02:17.405 --> 02:20.541
BECAUSE NOT VERY MANY PEOPLE
HAVE HEARD OF US.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.576
I MEAN, WHEN I TELL PEOPLE
THAT I WORK AT DUNDER MIFFLIN,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.678
THEY THINK THAT
WE SELL MUFFLERS,

02:24.712 --> 02:29.350
OR MUFFINS, OR MITTENS, OR...

02:29.383 --> 02:31.619
AND FRANKLY, ALL OF THOSE
SOUND BETTER THAN PAPER,

02:31.652 --> 02:33.754
SO I LET IT SLIDE.

02:33.787 --> 02:36.390
[cheerful music]

*

03:11.925 --> 03:13.261
YOU PLAYING THAT GAME AGAIN?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.962
SECOND LIFE IS NOT A GAME.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.931
IT IS A MULTI-USER
VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.967
IT DOESN'T HAVE POINTS
OR SCORES.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.435
IT DOESN'T HAVE WINNERS
OR LOSERS.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.437
OH, IT HAS LOSERS.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.274
I SIGNED UP FOR SECOND LIFE
ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.775
BACK THEN MY LIFE WAS SO GREAT

03:27.808 --> 03:29.643
THAT I LITERALLY WANTED
A SECOND ONE.

03:29.677 --> 03:32.746
IN MY SECOND LIFE,
I WAS ALSO A PAPER SALESMAN,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.648
AND I WAS ALSO NAMED DWIGHT.

03:34.682 --> 03:37.017
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
WAS THE SAME,

03:37.050 --> 03:39.387
EXCEPT I COULD FLY.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.789
LITTLE GIRL IN A FIELD

03:41.822 --> 03:43.324
HOLDING A FLOWER.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.692
WE ZOOM BACK

03:44.725 --> 03:46.760
TO FIND THAT SHE'S
IN THE DESERT,

03:46.794 --> 03:49.797
AND THE FIELD IS AN OASIS.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.532
WE ZOOM BACK FURTHER.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.734
THE DESERT IS A SANDBOX

03:53.767 --> 03:56.604
IN THE WORLD'S LARGEST
RESORT HOTEL.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.805
ZOOM BACK FURTHER.

03:57.838 --> 04:01.775
THE HOTEL IS ACTUALLY
THE PLAYGROUND

04:01.809 --> 04:05.045
OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRISON.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.046
ZOOM BACK FURTHER--

04:06.079 --> 04:07.315
OKAY, I'M--

04:07.348 --> 04:08.349
I CAN TELL THAT YOUR TIME
IS VALUABLE.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.518
ACTUALLY I DON'T GET PAID

04:10.551 --> 04:12.320
BY THE HOUR ANYMORE,
BUT THANK YOU.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.622
I GET PAID BY THE YEAR, SO...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.056
THAT ALL SOUNDS
REALLY, REALLY AMBITIOUS.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.725
YEAH, I KNOW.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.727
WHY DON'T WE SHOW YOU WHAT
WE DID WITH THE NATIONAL BRANCH.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.596
MM, OKAY.

[bossa nova music]

04:25.633 --> 04:31.639

04:53.927 --> 04:55.729
THAT'S WHAT NATIONAL
CAME UP WITH?

04:55.763 --> 04:57.665
THAT SUCKS!
WOW!

04:57.698 --> 05:00.568
THAT'S WHAT WE CAME UP WITH.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.802
WELL WE CAN DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.970
WELL THE MAIN PART
OF THE AD

05:03.003 --> 05:04.438
HAS TO STAY THE SAME,
ACTUALLY.

05:04.472 --> 05:05.473
YEAH, IT'S THE LAST FIVE SECONDS

05:05.506 --> 05:08.976
WHERE WE HAVE SOME LEEWAY.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.444
THE WAVING?

05:10.478 --> 05:11.912
WELL NO, NO.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE WAVING.

05:11.945 --> 05:12.913
THAT WAS JUST WHAT THEY DID.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.749
YOU GUYS CAN BE CLAPPING,
SITTING.

05:15.783 --> 05:18.051
STANDING OUTSIDE, INSIDE,
WHATEVER.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.754
I MEAN, THIS IS WHERE
YOU REALLY GET TO BE CREATIVE.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.590
(Andy)
I NEED SOME ADVICE.

05:22.623 --> 05:23.924
BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

05:23.957 --> 05:25.559
MAKING OUT WITH ANGELA
LATELY.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.395
WE'VE BEEN NECKING,

05:27.428 --> 05:29.863
BUT ONLY NECKING, RIGHT?

05:29.897 --> 05:34.502
NOT ACTUALLY KISSING...
OUR MOUTHS.

05:34.535 --> 05:36.770
JUST A NECK ON NECK.

05:36.804 --> 05:40.007
IT'S JUST LIKE RUBBING/NUZZLING
OUR NECKS TOGETHER.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.643
IT'S HOT.
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.944
BUT IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.480
BUT YOU SEEM LIKE A GUY
WITH ANSWERS.

05:46.514 --> 05:49.550
SO HOW DO I FAST-TRACK THIS,
GET TO FIRST BASE?

05:49.583 --> 05:55.122
WE CANNOT TALK ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE...

05:55.155 --> 05:56.690
SOMEONE MIGHT HEAR US.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.493
WE'LL USE CODE NAMES.

05:59.527 --> 06:03.096
ANGELA CAN STAY THE SAME,

06:03.130 --> 06:06.634
BUT WE'LL CHANGE ANDY
TO DWIGHT.

06:06.667 --> 06:10.571
THAT'S NOT DIFFERENT ENOUGH.

06:10.604 --> 06:12.372
DWIKE?

06:15.075 --> 06:17.845
YOU HAVE A CALL
FROM EDDIE MURPHY.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.051
HELLO?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.687
[Michael over speaker]
SHREK!
SHREK, I'M A DONKEY!

I'M A DONKEY, SHREK!

06:30.824 --> 06:32.960
IT'S ME.
HELLO, RY.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.695
WHAT?

06:34.728 --> 06:35.763
OKAY, CALM DOWN.

06:35.796 --> 06:37.230
I HAVE A SMALL PROBLEM.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.198
[Ryan on speaker]
I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL
ABOUT SMALL PROBLEMS.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.168
YEAH, WELL WHEN I CALL
ABOUT BIG PROBLEMS,

06:41.201 --> 06:42.603
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER,

06:42.636 --> 06:44.605
SO MAKE UP YOUR MIND, KIDDO.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.873
HERE IS THE DEAL.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.508
THE AD GUYS THAT YOU SENT

06:47.541 --> 06:50.511
ARE LOCKING ME
IN A CREATIVE BOX

06:50.544 --> 06:52.680
AND SORT OF IGNORING
MY IDEAS.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.615
THAT'S GOOD.
THEY'RE CREATIVE, YOU'RE NOT.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.050
I'M CREATIVE, RYAN.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.552
IT'S NOT PART OF YOUR JOB.

06:58.586 --> 07:00.087
IT'S LIKE,
MAYBE YOU CAN COOK.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.690
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD START A RESTAURANT.

07:02.723 --> 07:05.092
WELL, ACTUALLY I CAN'T COOK,
AND I AM STARTING A RESTAURANT.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.994
MIKE'S CEREAL SHACK.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.696
I'M THINKING WE'LL HAVE

07:08.729 --> 07:10.931
AS MANY VARIETIES
AS YOU CAN BUY IN THE STORE.

07:10.964 --> 07:12.800
OKAY, I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED
IN THAT RIGHT NOW.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.536
I'M DELEGATING CREATIVITY
TO CREATIVE PROFESSIONALS.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.737
IT'S A DIFFERENT SKILL SET.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.038
LOOK, I WASN'T GOOD AT SALES,
RIGHT?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.006
YEAH!

07:19.039 --> 07:20.708
BUT I'M GOOD
AT MANAGING PEOPLE WHO DO SALES.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.709
ARE YOU?

07:21.742 --> 07:22.843
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE DOING

07:22.876 --> 07:24.478
SUCH A GREAT JOB HERE,

07:24.512 --> 07:26.780
SUPPRESSING IDEAS
AND CREATIVITY.

07:26.814 --> 07:28.649
(Michael)
ALL RIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.684
TELL ME IF YOU THINK
THIS IS CREATIVE.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.119
WHEN I WAS FIVE,

07:32.152 --> 07:37.124
I IMAGINED THAT THERE WAS
SUCH A THING AS A UNICORN.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.628
AND THIS IS BEFORE I HAD
EVEN HEARD OF ONE

07:40.661 --> 07:41.895
OR SEEN ONE.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.998
I JUST DREW A PICTURE
OF A HORSE

07:45.032 --> 07:48.168
THAT COULD FLY OVER RAINBOWS

07:48.201 --> 07:50.938
AND HAD A HUGE SPIKE
IN ITS HEAD.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.842
I WAS FIVE.
FIVE YEARS OLD.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.877
COULDN'T EVEN TALK YET.

HEY, GUYS.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.781
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:00.814 --> 08:03.517
WE CANNOT SHOOT
THIS AD TODAY.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.686
OKAY, WHEN SHOULD WE
COME BACK?

08:05.719 --> 08:09.122
HOW ABOUT NEVER HUNDRED HOURS,
SIR?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.258
WAIT, WE WERE SENT HERE
TO HELP YOU--

08:11.291 --> 08:12.926
I'M NOT GONNA ARGUE
WITH THIS GUY.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.762
LET'S GO.
GOOD LUCK, DUDE.

08:14.795 --> 08:15.763
HEY THANKS.

WHAT IS THIS ABOUT
DISMISSING THE AD PEOPLE?

08:20.868 --> 08:22.536
YEAH, I'M GLAD YOU CALLED.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.838

[Ryan on speaker]
I'M ON, MICHAEL.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.041
WHAT'S UP, MY BROTHER?

08:28.075 --> 08:30.010
LISTEN, DAVID.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.680
I WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS AD
IN HOUSE.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.616
I WANT TO USE ONLY
THE CREATIVITY

08:35.649 --> 08:37.651
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT HERE
IN THE OFFICE.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.720
AND I WILL SEND IT TO YOU
TOMORROW MORNING.

08:39.753 --> 08:40.988
TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.090
IF YOU DO NOT THINK
THAT IT'S READY TO AIR,

08:43.123 --> 08:45.659
SEND THE AD AGENCY
BACK DOWN HERE

08:45.693 --> 08:49.630
AND WE'LL DO IT ON MY DIME.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.698
[David on speaker]
THIS IS WEIRD.

08:50.731 --> 08:54.802
I'M WILLING TO STAKE
MY ENTIRE REPUTATION ON IT.

08:54.835 --> 08:55.869
[David on speaker]
OKAY.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.671
I'LL SEE IT TOMORROW.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.641
OKAY.
OKAY.

AND THUS MICHAEL SCOTT
SEALED HIS OWN DESTINY...

09:06.847 --> 09:08.548
IN A GOOD WAY.

09:10.117 --> 09:13.053
HAS ANYONE EVER COME UP TO YOU
AND SAID,

09:13.086 --> 09:15.088
"YOU'RE NOT CREATIVE."

09:15.122 --> 09:16.356
YES.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.025
WELL, THEY'RE WRONG.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.059
YOU ARE CREATIVE.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.961
YOU ARE DAMN CREATIVE.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.596
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.765
YOU ARE SO MUCH MORE CREATIVE

09:24.798 --> 09:26.800
THAN ALL OF THE OTHER DRY,
BORING MORONS

09:26.834 --> 09:29.703
THAT YOU WORK WITH.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.071
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO
SPECIFICALLY?

09:31.104 --> 09:34.775
I KIND OF KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE IN COMMERCIALS.

09:34.808 --> 09:40.648
MY NICKNAME IN HIGH SCHOOL
USED TO BE KOOL-AID MAN.

09:40.681 --> 09:41.849
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
I ALWAYS WANTED

09:41.882 --> 09:43.083
TO BE AN ACTOR IN COMMERCIALS,

09:43.116 --> 09:45.152
THEN I REALIZED
I HAD A BRAIN.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.887
I'M EXCITED ABOUT DOING THE AD,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.723
BUT I'M NOT REALLY USED
TO DOING VIDEOS

09:49.757 --> 09:51.825
WITH SO MANY PEOPLE AROUND.

09:51.859 --> 09:54.194
WE HAVE THREE SCENES TO FILM,
BIG SCENES.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.629
WE HAVE A SONG TO WRITE,

09:55.663 --> 09:57.264
SO LET'S GET CRACKING.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.099
KELLY, I WANT YOU TO DO
MAKE-UP.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.169
OSCAR, I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO DO COSTUME DESIGN OBVIOUSLY.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.804
PHYLLIS, I'D LIKE YOU
TO LOOK AROUND TOWN

10:03.837 --> 10:05.072
AND SEE IF WE HAVE
ANY CELEBRITIES

10:05.105 --> 10:07.407
IN OUR LOCAL AREA.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.308
[Phyllis gasps]

10:08.341 --> 10:10.210
SUE GRAFTON IS AT
THE STEAMTOWN MALL!

10:10.243 --> 10:11.779
SHE'S DOING A BOOK SIGNING
RIGHT NOW.

10:11.812 --> 10:12.913
OKAY, OKAY.

10:12.946 --> 10:13.947
PHYLLIS, THIS IS WHAT
I WANT YOU TO DO.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.282
I WANT YOU TO GO DOWN
TO THE MALL.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.817
I WANT YOU TO GET IN LINE.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.721
I WANT YOU TO GET HER
TO BE IN THIS COMMERCIAL.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.957
THIS WOULD BE A HUGE COUPE,
PEOPLE.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.659
ALL RIGHT,
DO NOT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.794
OKAY.

10:26.827 --> 10:27.761
(Andy)
DOES ANYONE ACTUALLY KNOW

10:27.795 --> 10:29.296
WHAT SUE GRAFTON LOOKS LIKE?

10:29.329 --> 10:30.731
I MEAN, IS SHE HOT OR--

10:30.764 --> 10:31.665
SHE'S CRAZY HOT.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.835
WELL THEN MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST USE ANGELA

10:34.868 --> 10:35.836
AND SAY SHE'S SUE GRAFTON.

10:35.869 --> 10:36.837
WOULD ANYONE NOTICE?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.371
THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

10:38.405 --> 10:41.074
I FIND THE MYSTERY GENRE
DISGUSTING.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.844
I HATE BEING TITILLATED.

10:43.877 --> 10:44.978

11:23.784 --> 11:25.819
THAT THIS WAS GOING

14:19.692 --> 14:21.261
I ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED
TO BE IN THE AD,

14:21.294 --> 14:22.662
AND SHE SAID "NO, THANK YOU."

14:22.695 --> 14:24.397

15:32.265 --> 15:35.102
I WORKED UNTIL ABOUT
2:45 AM.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.203
AND THEN I HAD TO DECIDE

15:36.236 --> 15:37.337
IF I WANTED TO SPEND THE NIGHT

15:37.370 --> 15:40.107
WITH MICHAEL EDITING
IN HIS OFFICE,

15:40.140 --> 15:42.976
AND DWIGHT WATCHING MICHAEL EDIT
IN HIS OFFICE,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.545
OR DRIVE HOME AND PROBABLY
FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL

15:45.578 --> 15:47.180
AND DIE IN A FIERY CAR WRECK.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.283
I PASSED OUT ON MY KEYBOARD
TRYING TO DECIDE.

15:52.585 --> 15:53.653
LET ME POUR YOU SOME BUBBLY,

15:53.686 --> 15:56.656
BECAUSE SOMEBODY GOT

15:56.689 --> 15:59.359
ANDY, I CAN'T HEAR THIS
RIGHT NOW.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.393
NO, NO, NO,
THIS IS GOOD.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.195
YOU KNOW HOW WE HAVEN'T REALLY
GOTTEN ANYWHERE

16:02.229 --> 16:04.364
THAT I WANT TO GET TO

16:04.397 --> 16:07.367
WELL, LAST NIGHT
THAT CHANGED.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.302
WE'RE MAKING OUT.

16:09.336 --> 16:11.171
I'M KISSING HER NECK,
AND HER CHEEK,

16:11.204 --> 16:13.006
AND HER EARLOBE.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.774
AND SHE'S NOT REALLY
KISSING ME BACK,

16:14.807 --> 16:16.643
BUT SHE CLOSES HER EYES

16:16.676 --> 16:22.015
AND SHE'S, LIKE,
"OH, D. OH, D."

16:23.716 --> 16:26.486
SHE CALLED YOU D?

16:26.519 --> 16:30.190

WITH AN IDEA.

18:48.795 --> 18:52.599

WHERE AN IDEA WILL END UP.
