WEBVTT

00:13.500 --> 00:14.665
What is this, dog meat?

00:14.700 --> 00:16.500
Looks like the same
crap we had yesterday.

00:16.535 --> 00:18.000
You should've ate it all yesterday.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.900
Anyone seen Lieutenant Ferris?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.400
Check the head, sir. Been in
his office since breakfast.

00:22.435 --> 00:24.400
Probably plotting his
revenge against Mitas.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.500
Bite me.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.465
Couldn't taste any worse than this chow.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.500
All right, one of you guys better
go check to see if he's okay.

00:30.535 --> 00:32.100
Ferris. You all right?

00:32.700 --> 00:34.000
Yeah, I'm fine, sir.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.000
At least until I ate this crap.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.500
No new orders from STRATCOM?

00:37.700 --> 00:39.000
No, sir, just checked.

00:39.200 --> 00:40.200
Nothing.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.900
Hair of the dog, Ferris?

00:42.300 --> 00:43.500
Go to hell, Mitas.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.100
Man, what's the matter?

00:52.200 --> 00:53.400
Takada, what's wrong?

00:59.300 --> 01:00.600
Get him to sick bay!

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
Now!

02:16.581 --> 02:18.481
Don't you have paperwork, DiNozzo?

02:18.581 --> 02:19.881
What do you think I'm doing?

02:20.081 --> 02:21.281
I take the paper...

02:21.681 --> 02:22.781
and I make it work.

02:29.081 --> 02:30.581
- Tonight's the night.
- What night?

02:30.981 --> 02:32.681
- Brain Matter.
- Brain Matter?

02:32.781 --> 02:34.681
Yeah, my friend's band. Remember?

02:35.081 --> 02:36.381
Brain Matter.

02:36.481 --> 02:38.381
Yeah, you guys all
promised you'd go with me.

02:38.581 --> 02:40.081
- All of us?
- All of you.

02:40.181 --> 02:41.681
- Even me?
- Even you.

02:42.081 --> 02:43.081
And you...

02:43.981 --> 02:46.181
- and you.
- I don't think I can make it tonight.

02:46.281 --> 02:47.431
I've got to...

02:47.466 --> 02:48.581
catch up on

02:48.881 --> 02:49.881
paperwork.

02:49.981 --> 02:51.581
And I've got a very important thing.

02:51.616 --> 02:52.981
And other thing.

02:53.281 --> 02:54.981
And, I-I've got...

02:55.481 --> 02:58.281
Some people wear these
spiky things just for show.

03:00.681 --> 03:01.681
I don't.

03:03.181 --> 03:05.881
I've got nothing better
to do than-than to see...

03:05.981 --> 03:07.481
A dead body, McGee?

03:07.581 --> 03:08.781
You read my mind, boss.

03:08.816 --> 03:09.816
It's a quick read.

03:09.881 --> 03:11.281
Pack up. Full kit.

03:13.481 --> 03:14.781
Motion sickness meds?

03:14.881 --> 03:16.781
Chopper's waiting at N.A.S. Anacostia.

03:18.081 --> 03:19.581
I'm fine on a chopper, boss.

03:20.881 --> 03:23.281
Chopper takes us to the ship, McGee.

03:23.381 --> 03:24.981
USNS Chimera.

03:25.081 --> 03:26.346
Get briefed at Anacostia.

03:26.381 --> 03:29.081
You know, Brain Matter's
playing a really late set.

03:29.281 --> 03:30.581
That's odd, there's...

03:30.681 --> 03:32.181
no Chimera on the register.

03:32.381 --> 03:33.681
Any reason why that would be?

03:34.981 --> 03:36.581
We'll get briefed at Anacostia.

03:37.781 --> 03:38.946
Okay, I'll get my gear.

03:38.981 --> 03:41.781
I'll get Duck. Pack a toothbrush.
We're going to be there a while.

03:41.881 --> 03:43.581
Well, look on the bright side, Probie.

03:43.616 --> 03:44.881
Ixnay on the AinMatterBray.

03:44.981 --> 03:46.181
Really wish I could go,

03:46.581 --> 03:47.581
sorry.

03:50.081 --> 03:51.081
Thanks anyway.

03:55.081 --> 03:56.081
Take a...

03:56.381 --> 03:57.381
Brain check?

03:58.581 --> 03:59.581
Sorry.

04:01.481 --> 04:03.481
We received word of
the death this morning.

04:03.581 --> 04:04.981
They say what killed the guy?

04:05.181 --> 04:06.881
Isn't that your job, Agent Gibbs?

04:07.981 --> 04:11.181
Commander Wilkins will have you
out to the Chimera by nightfall.

04:11.381 --> 04:13.181
Chimera's not listed in the Navy fleet.

04:13.281 --> 04:14.581
It's not on the books.

04:15.081 --> 04:16.880
The Chimera's a highly sophisticated,

04:16.981 --> 04:18.581
top-secret research vessel.

04:18.880 --> 04:19.981
Researching what?

04:20.581 --> 04:21.680
That's need-to-know.

04:21.880 --> 04:22.881
And you don't.

04:23.481 --> 04:26.281
That's the "top secret" part, McGee.

04:27.281 --> 04:28.246
Go in,

04:28.281 --> 04:29.331
get the body,

04:29.366 --> 04:30.381
come back out.

04:30.481 --> 04:31.881
We've got a death to investigate.

04:32.081 --> 04:33.281
Take witness statements,

04:33.381 --> 04:34.581
do what you need to do.

04:34.981 --> 04:36.981
Just don't ask anything
beyond your pay level.

04:38.281 --> 04:39.681
We'll do our jobs, Commander.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.846
NCIS was called out
because no other federal

04:42.881 --> 04:45.881
investigative agency has
clearance to get on the Chimera.

04:46.281 --> 04:49.081
That said, even you guys don't
have clearance to know what's on it.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.731
I get it, boss.

04:50.766 --> 04:51.881
It's a black ship.

04:52.181 --> 04:53.181
Black sheep?

04:53.481 --> 04:54.731
No, they don't exist.

04:54.766 --> 04:55.981
I've seen black sheep.

04:56.181 --> 04:58.181
No, I said "black ship," not sheep.

04:58.681 --> 05:00.781
Clearly the US Navy is
still intent on pulling

05:00.816 --> 05:02.881
the wool over the eyes
of the American people.

05:02.916 --> 05:04.381
- Sir.
- No photos.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.181
It's standard procedure.

05:07.381 --> 05:09.081
There's nothing standard
about the Chimera.

05:09.181 --> 05:11.481
I don't want anyone
documenting what's on that ship.

05:13.281 --> 05:14.481
Bring the camera, McGee.

05:18.081 --> 05:21.081
I suggest you keep your
inquiry focused on that body.

05:24.881 --> 05:28.581
Chimera, Lady 8-0-6 approaching
your deck for landing. Over.

05:30.081 --> 05:32.081
Chimera, do you copy? Over.

05:33.181 --> 05:34.881
The ship's LZ is obstructed.

05:34.981 --> 05:36.681
We'll hold above deck in a hover.

05:39.581 --> 05:42.181
We still can't raise any of
the crew on the radio, sir.

05:42.281 --> 05:43.881
Alert Commander Skinner.

05:43.916 --> 05:44.981
Will do.

05:56.081 --> 05:57.581
Where's the welcoming committee?

05:57.781 --> 05:58.981
The deck lights are on.

05:59.281 --> 06:00.281
Nobody's home.

06:00.381 --> 06:02.881
This is most unusual, Jethro.

06:02.981 --> 06:04.981
- It is creepy.
- It's a ghost ship.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.181
Agent Gibbs, we have reserve fuel.

06:07.281 --> 06:08.981
We need to know if you're staying, sir.

06:09.016 --> 06:10.381
Boss, I've got to tell you...

06:10.581 --> 06:12.381
I don't have a real
good feeling about this.

06:18.281 --> 06:19.381
We're staying.

06:35.081 --> 06:37.481
So this is the highly sophisticated,

06:37.581 --> 06:38.981
top secret ship?

06:39.681 --> 06:41.681
Looks more like an old tramp steamer.

06:41.881 --> 06:44.181
I suppose they were trying
to look inconspicuous,

06:44.381 --> 06:45.681
hoping to be left alone.

06:49.281 --> 06:51.481
Can you get any more alone than this?

06:59.681 --> 07:02.781
I'm beginning to wonder whether
they dropped us on the right ship.

07:04.081 --> 07:05.081
Right ship.

07:06.881 --> 07:07.981
Wrong night.

07:24.281 --> 07:25.381
Every room is empty.

07:25.881 --> 07:27.581
It's like the entire crew disappeared.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.281
Welcome aboard the USNS Houdini.

07:31.381 --> 07:32.481
Still playing.

07:33.781 --> 07:35.481
Hey, it's your favorite, McGee.

07:35.981 --> 07:36.981
Brain Matter.

07:37.581 --> 07:38.581
Thanks.

07:39.381 --> 07:40.781
I feel bad enough already, okay?

07:40.981 --> 07:42.081
Take another pill.

07:43.181 --> 07:44.181
Sorry.

07:46.381 --> 07:48.081
Wait a second, this
doesn't make any sense.

07:48.381 --> 07:49.681
Something suspicious?

07:49.781 --> 07:50.881
Absolutely.

07:50.981 --> 07:53.081
This guy had a full
house. Why would he fold?

07:56.181 --> 07:57.981
"Dear Mary Beth. Good news.

07:58.181 --> 08:01.081
Overheard the captain say they
had a good dive last night.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.981
If they found what
they were looking for,

08:03.081 --> 08:04.881
we could be heading home any day.

08:05.081 --> 08:07.381
I can't tell you much
about the mission, but..."

08:09.681 --> 08:10.681
But...?

08:12.281 --> 08:13.281
It stops there.

08:16.381 --> 08:19.181
You think they all just
went out for an evening swim?

08:19.281 --> 08:20.781
You notice something missing, Duck?

08:20.881 --> 08:21.981
People.

08:22.081 --> 08:23.081
Life boats.

08:23.381 --> 08:26.181
Yeah, I didn't notice any
on the starboard side either.

08:26.381 --> 08:27.481
The ship was abandoned.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.146
In a hurry, it would seem.

08:29.181 --> 08:30.781
Too much of a hurry to send a Mayday?

08:30.881 --> 08:33.780
No, no, Jethro. No questions
beyond your pay level.

08:37.881 --> 08:39.181
Five minutes.

08:39.280 --> 08:40.381
You owe me ten bucks.

08:43.381 --> 08:44.381
Where's McGee?

08:44.481 --> 08:45.446
Calling Earl.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.631
Shouting groceries.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.781
Making street pizza.

08:48.081 --> 08:49.281
Technicolor yawn.

08:53.281 --> 08:54.631
I found something.

08:54.666 --> 08:55.981
Lost something, too.

09:09.481 --> 09:11.981
I guess you can't judge
a black ship by its wool.

09:12.016 --> 09:13.446
What are they researching, Duck?

09:13.481 --> 09:15.681
Something to do with
rats, if I were to guess

09:15.781 --> 09:17.381
from these empty cages.

09:17.481 --> 09:19.081
Skinner seemed pretty paranoid.

09:19.281 --> 09:21.281
Guessing the mission
wasn't purely humanitarian.

09:21.481 --> 09:23.081
I doubt it's even human.

09:23.381 --> 09:24.781
Thermosalinographs,

09:24.881 --> 09:27.681
fluorometer, carbon analyzer...

09:28.181 --> 09:29.681
Whatever it is,

09:30.181 --> 09:32.281
it's not visible to the naked eye.

09:36.781 --> 09:37.981
What was that?

09:38.381 --> 09:39.946
Could be the metal of the ship

09:39.981 --> 09:42.081
contracting in the cool of the evening.

09:43.781 --> 09:44.746
Or not.

09:44.781 --> 09:47.481
Sounded as if it was coming
from the cargo hold above us.

09:48.081 --> 09:49.181
Duck, you're with me.

09:49.481 --> 09:50.681
Check out the cargo hold.

09:50.781 --> 09:52.781
I was afraid you were going to say that.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.000
Baa baa, black ship...

10:02.900 --> 10:05.800
Have you any wool?

10:07.100 --> 10:09.900
Yes sir, Yes sir...

10:10.300 --> 10:11.565
But no one gets to see it.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.000
You're gonna need top secret
government clearance...

10:16.900 --> 10:18.600
Someone or something's on the ship

10:18.900 --> 10:19.900
with us.

10:20.500 --> 10:21.500
I can feel it.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.600
Yeah, I can see it.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.600
Scared much, DiNozzo?

10:29.900 --> 10:31.000
Stuff it, McBarf Bag.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.600
It's just a cute, little rat.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.300
Why the irrational fear?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.500
It's not cute.

10:35.600 --> 10:36.665
It's not little.

10:36.700 --> 10:37.900
And it's not irrational.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.300
Cowardly then?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.700
Not if you're uh,

10:40.800 --> 10:43.100
someone who survived a
bout of pneumonic plague,

10:43.135 --> 10:44.400
thank you very much.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.200
Rats are a known carrier.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.900
I used to love rats before the plague.

10:49.700 --> 10:52.100
- I was a regular Willard.
- What is a Willard?

10:52.200 --> 10:53.300
It's a movie.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.500
Willard had a pet rat named Ben.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.000
Social misfit.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.900
Made fun of by his coworkers.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.100
He had a creepy boss.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.500
No wonder you're related.

11:02.600 --> 11:03.900
You think Gibbs is creepy?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.800
I think she meant the social
misfit, made fun of part.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.200
Did you hear that?

11:09.500 --> 11:10.565
- No.
- No.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.900
There's something aboard.

11:12.300 --> 11:13.700
Other than a rat.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.000
What do your astute

11:17.100 --> 11:19.300
ninja Mossad senses tell you it is?

11:19.800 --> 11:23.200
In Mossad part of the training is
to be open to things you cannot see.

11:23.400 --> 11:24.565
Or even understand.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.000
You mean the supernatural?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.365
Call it what you want.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.600
Not everything can be explained
by the laws of the natural world.

11:30.800 --> 11:32.000
You believe in ghosts?

11:32.100 --> 11:34.400
I do not not believe in ghosts.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.700
Or demons.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.500
Or monsters.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.900
We are on a ship called the Chimera.

11:41.100 --> 11:43.600
I thought Chimera meant
delusion or fantasy.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.465
In Greek mythology,
a Chimera is a monster

11:46.500 --> 11:49.700
with a lion's head, a goat's
body and a dragon's tail.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.700
So you think they named
this ship the Chimera

11:51.735 --> 11:53.300
because there's a monster on board?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.200
They did not name it the Puppy.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.500
Boo.

12:03.900 --> 12:04.900
Get in here.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.500
Well, whatever's on this
boat must be pretty damn scary

12:11.600 --> 12:14.100
if it got them to ditch
this delicious-looking...

12:14.800 --> 12:15.900
What is this stuff?

12:16.800 --> 12:17.800
Don't ask me.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.700
That's not a request, it's a command.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.600
The plot sickens.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.100
This is our crime scene.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.300
If there was a crime.

12:27.900 --> 12:29.100
Well, you see these

12:29.300 --> 12:31.800
little flecks of brown in the blood?

12:32.900 --> 12:34.565
Coffee-ground emesis.

12:34.600 --> 12:37.200
Usually a sign of alcoholism but

12:37.700 --> 12:41.800
you can get it from severe
gastrointestinal distress.

12:46.100 --> 12:47.200
Steady, Probie.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.200
Tell that to my stomach.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.500
Steady, Probie's stomach.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.500
I would not stand there if I were you.

12:55.500 --> 12:56.700
That's a good point.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.600
You don't want to
compromise the crime scene.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.100
Gibbs.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.600
Partial footprint.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.700
In blood. They lead out of here.

13:10.700 --> 13:11.700
In here.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.700
You were right, Ziva.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
Someone is on board with us.

13:33.400 --> 13:34.400
Not him.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.700
There's something alive.

13:36.100 --> 13:37.100
I can feel it.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.100
A lion-headed dragon goat?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Maybe.

13:43.900 --> 13:47.200
Someone tossed a month's supply of
creamed corn to make room for him.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.800
Please don't say that again.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.265
"Tossed"?

13:50.300 --> 13:51.600
No. "Creamed corn."

13:51.800 --> 13:54.400
There's significant petechial
hemorrhaging in the eyes.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.700
These little pinpoints of blood.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.100
It's often a sign of asphyxia.

13:59.500 --> 14:02.700
Well, we won't know for sure
until we conduct some tests.

14:03.200 --> 14:04.600
McGee, get me a satellite link.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.800
Abby.

14:21.100 --> 14:22.100
Abby!

14:23.700 --> 14:24.700
Abby!

14:25.900 --> 14:26.900
McGee!

14:27.300 --> 14:29.100
You shouldn't sneak
up on people like that!

14:29.200 --> 14:30.800
What the hell is that noise?

14:33.300 --> 14:34.300
Brain Matter.

14:35.900 --> 14:36.900
I love them.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.100
You guys okay?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, yeah, we're peachy.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.400
I am dealing with my boat phobia,

14:42.700 --> 14:44.300
Tony's dealing with his rat phobia,

14:44.400 --> 14:46.200
and Ziva's dealing
with her ghost phobia.

14:46.235 --> 14:48.000
So, what's Gibbs dealing with?

14:48.900 --> 14:49.865
Them.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.700
Abs, patch me through to the Director.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.400
No need, Jethro, I'm
here. What's the status?

14:54.435 --> 14:56.200
Well, the crew has disappeared...

14:56.500 --> 14:58.600
- except for one.
- Did he tell you where they are?

14:58.635 --> 14:59.900
No. He's dead.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.900
Have you ID'd him?

15:02.400 --> 15:03.400
Yeah, hang on.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.700
Dr. Satoshi Takada.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.500
What do you got on him, Abs?

15:10.900 --> 15:12.400
Dr. Satoshi Takada.

15:12.435 --> 15:13.865
Marine biologist.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.500
Lieutenant Commander
for the Navy since 1997.

15:16.700 --> 15:18.600
PhD in biology from LSU.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.000
Make sure Skinner knows he's got
20 men stranded in life boats.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.000
I'll get right on it. Does
Ducky have a cause of death?

15:25.200 --> 15:27.600
We're still doing tests.
Don't know what killed him yet.

15:27.700 --> 15:28.700
Yes, we do.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.265
My initial

15:31.300 --> 15:34.400
diagnosis of asphyxia
was incorrect, I'm afraid.

15:34.900 --> 15:36.700
It looks as if Takada died of

15:36.800 --> 15:38.700
viral hemorrhagic fever...

15:38.900 --> 15:41.700
to which, by now, we
have all been exposed.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.100
Can't leave the ship.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.100
Well, that's not a problem, Jethro.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.300
If my diagnosis is correct...

15:49.800 --> 15:51.400
we'll all be dead by morning.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.500
STRATCOM has received no
signals from any life boats.

16:04.535 --> 16:07.200
A crew of 20 doesn't just
disappear into thin air.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.100
Trust me, we'll find those men.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.465
We're dispatching our
rescue-and-recovery ops,

16:11.500 --> 16:14.100
and getting a relief crew
out to the Chimera ASAP.

16:14.730 --> 16:18.630
I need you to tell me what kind of
research the Chimera was involved in.

16:18.930 --> 16:20.830
Deep-sea marine-life
exploration.

16:20.930 --> 16:23.030
I'm afraid I can't say
anything more than that.

16:23.065 --> 16:23.995
It's classified.

16:24.030 --> 16:26.395
I have top secret clearance, Commander.

16:26.430 --> 16:28.730
The mission is above
top secret, Director.

16:28.765 --> 16:31.030
But trust me, it's pretty mundane stuff.

16:31.130 --> 16:33.095
My medical examiner believes

16:33.130 --> 16:35.730
that Dr. Takada died from a deadly virus

16:35.830 --> 16:39.130
he may have contracted
from the "mundane stuff"

16:39.230 --> 16:40.430
he was studying.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.530
Then he must be mistaken in
his preliminary diagnosis.

16:43.630 --> 16:45.430
Something on that ship killed him.

16:45.465 --> 16:47.230
We have no reason to believe

16:47.330 --> 16:49.930
that Dr. Takada's research had
anything to do with his death.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.880
Commander, if you insist
on stonewalling me,

16:52.915 --> 16:55.730
I can take this to a
higher command level.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.430
I'm not stonewalling, Director.

16:57.630 --> 16:58.830
I'm telling you the truth.

16:58.930 --> 17:00.430
You're not telling me a damn thing.

17:00.630 --> 17:03.930
You do not run black ops to
carry out mundane research.

17:04.030 --> 17:06.829
The lives of my agents
are being threatened,

17:06.930 --> 17:09.530
and I need to know what
is threatening them.

17:13.730 --> 17:15.530
Primitive conditions, Duck.

17:15.730 --> 17:16.730
Primitive?

17:16.829 --> 17:18.930
You remember that tiny thatched cottage

17:19.030 --> 17:21.230
I used as an examination
room in Namibia?

17:21.329 --> 17:23.730
Yes, of course then I
was working on Pygmies.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.030
You know what killed him?

17:25.130 --> 17:28.230
Well, if Dr. Takada was a
bit too fond of his Scotch,

17:28.329 --> 17:30.630
what I'm seeing here
is oesophageal varices,

17:30.730 --> 17:34.530
and this tear caused blood
to enter his oesophagus,

17:34.565 --> 17:36.030
causing him to vomit blood.

17:36.330 --> 17:40.430
Or, Dr. Takada could have had a
severe gastrointestinal infection,

17:40.630 --> 17:42.930
that produced a Mallory-Weiss tear.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.030
In which case, the vomiting
would have come first.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.930
Neither diagnosis is inconsistent
with haemorrhagic fever.

17:50.030 --> 17:51.230
And if we were exposed?

17:51.330 --> 17:52.330
Well, I'm...

17:52.430 --> 17:54.630
hampered from
prognosticating further until

17:54.730 --> 17:57.830
Dr. DiNozzo gives me a
proper blood analysis.

17:58.030 --> 18:00.530
Abby, where's the gas chromato-thinga?

18:00.630 --> 18:03.380
It's the, uh, boxy-looking
thing with the,<lll>

18:03.415 --> 18:06.130
um, circular door-like
thing on the front.

18:07.730 --> 18:09.230
- I got it.
- Okay, good. Now,

18:09.330 --> 18:13.230
put the sample in the circular
rack-like thing at the top.

18:14.330 --> 18:15.295
Got it.

18:15.330 --> 18:17.380
Okay, press the blue start button.

18:17.415 --> 18:19.430
It's-it's blue-ish
and square-ish.

18:19.830 --> 18:21.630
It's on a tower on the top, Tony.

18:21.665 --> 18:22.830
The tower-like thing.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.080
- Got it.
- While we're waiting the

18:25.115 --> 18:26.595
analysis, let's get the blood count.

18:26.630 --> 18:29.030
So, place a small amount
of blood on your slide.

18:29.230 --> 18:31.430
It's amazing what you
can learn from blood,

18:31.465 --> 18:33.330
even before it's analyzed. I mean,

18:33.430 --> 18:35.730
the color, the texture, the smell.

18:35.930 --> 18:39.530
Okay, um, now take out the
dropper of Methylene Blue.

18:39.730 --> 18:41.830
It's blue-ish and
it's dropper-like.

18:42.230 --> 18:43.195
Got it.

18:43.230 --> 18:46.630
Okay, now place two drops of
the Methylene Blue on your slide.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.195
- We're good.
- Of course,

18:51.230 --> 18:53.630
blood that's passed through
someone's GI tract has a very

18:53.730 --> 18:55.030
particular smell.

18:56.030 --> 18:59.030
But since this guy may have died
from a highly contagious virus,

18:59.230 --> 19:00.830
whatever you do, do not inhale it.

19:03.430 --> 19:04.530
We're not good.

19:05.330 --> 19:07.230
Hey, you okay, DiNozzo?

19:07.630 --> 19:08.630
Not for long.

19:08.830 --> 19:11.430
Where's my blood analysis, DiNozzo?

19:11.530 --> 19:13.530
I'm working on it, Ducky.

19:14.030 --> 19:15.530
Maybe the last thing I do.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.330
Let's hope not.

19:17.430 --> 19:18.430
May I?

19:20.130 --> 19:22.930
There's definitely an
increased white blood count,

19:23.130 --> 19:25.430
with an absolute increase in lymphocytes

19:25.465 --> 19:27.295
having an atypical appearance.

19:27.330 --> 19:29.630
That would be consistent
with an acute viral infection.

19:29.730 --> 19:33.330
I have located three rodent
bites on Takada's body.

19:33.530 --> 19:36.830
Perhaps he contracted the
virus from a diseased rat.

19:37.230 --> 19:38.330
That would be bad.

19:38.430 --> 19:40.130
Maybe the top-secret

19:40.330 --> 19:42.930
whatever-it-was that Takada
is studying is what killed him.

19:43.030 --> 19:44.930
In which case it would be airborne.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.730
That would be really, really bad.

19:47.930 --> 19:50.495
Boss, I've got a feed from
MTAC with Director Shepard

19:50.530 --> 19:53.530
and Commander Skinner. They want
you and Ducky patched in right away.

20:00.830 --> 20:03.130
I'm flying a crew out to
take control of the ship.

20:03.430 --> 20:05.030
The risk is too great.

20:05.230 --> 20:07.530
Director, you cannot
allow anyone on this ship.

20:07.565 --> 20:09.830
I can put anyone I want to on that ship.

20:10.230 --> 20:13.430
Then I have no choice but
to quarantine the Chimera.

20:13.465 --> 20:14.630
On whose authority?!?

20:14.730 --> 20:15.530
Ours.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.830
Dr. Mallard is a medical examiner,

20:17.930 --> 20:20.030
Agent Gibbs is a federal officer.

20:20.130 --> 20:22.395
- That's my ship!
- Not anymore.

20:22.430 --> 20:24.530
What kind of game you
think you're playing, Gibbs?

20:24.565 --> 20:25.895
Any word from the missing crew?

20:25.930 --> 20:28.730
We have every possible
resource looking for those men.

20:28.930 --> 20:32.230
Look, given what we know,
this is high precedence.

20:32.330 --> 20:35.430
Those men may well have been
exposed to the virus, too.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.630
They may also need to be quarantined.

20:37.830 --> 20:40.430
You don't need to explain to
me the dangers involved here.

20:40.530 --> 20:42.730
It might've helped if you
had explained them to us.

20:43.130 --> 20:44.330
If that is all, Director,

20:44.430 --> 20:47.430
I'd like to go find out what
this virus is before it kills me.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.630
And quite possibly, everyone
else on this ship, too.

20:51.630 --> 20:52.630
Commander,

20:52.930 --> 20:56.330
I think it's time you tell me what
I need to know about your ship.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.695
I cannot divulge

20:57.730 --> 21:00.330
any more about the Chimera's
mission than I already have.

21:00.430 --> 21:03.530
Seeing as how my agents now
have control over your ship,

21:03.730 --> 21:06.230
I am going to instruct
them to investigate

21:06.330 --> 21:09.395
any and all aspects of
the Chimera's operation

21:09.430 --> 21:12.430
that will help them determine
what they are up against.

21:12.530 --> 21:14.930
Nothing will be off limits.

21:15.030 --> 21:16.030
You can't do that.

21:16.130 --> 21:17.430
You can't stop me.

21:17.530 --> 21:19.230
This is a classified mission.

21:19.330 --> 21:21.030
Then read me into it.

21:23.430 --> 21:25.730
Even if I wanted to read you
into the Chimera's mission,

21:25.830 --> 21:28.230
I can't do that over an MTAC feed.

21:28.630 --> 21:30.930
The file has to be
read to you in person.

21:30.965 --> 21:33.595
If you think I'm going to stand

21:33.630 --> 21:36.430
idly by while my agents'
lives are in danger,

21:36.530 --> 21:38.930
you are sadly mistaken.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.630
I will be waiting for you and your file,

21:41.730 --> 21:42.730
Commander.

21:42.830 --> 21:43.830
Now, you.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.330
We've been through almost
every room on this ship.

21:48.365 --> 21:50.730
"Almost" only counts in
horseshoes and hand grenades.

21:53.230 --> 21:54.730
Could... be a rat.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.230
Have to be an awfully big one.

21:56.330 --> 21:57.330
Or a ghost.

21:57.430 --> 21:59.530
- Are you done?
- Done searching the ship?

22:00.730 --> 22:02.230
We could always search it again.

22:02.330 --> 22:03.830
I could stay here with Ducky.

22:05.230 --> 22:06.630
Well, so he's not left alone.

22:06.730 --> 22:07.830
I'm not alone.

22:08.630 --> 22:10.530
I've got Takada to keep me company.

22:10.630 --> 22:11.630
Duck.

22:12.230 --> 22:13.230
Got it.

22:14.430 --> 22:15.695
So, Takada,

22:15.730 --> 22:18.230
as one doctor to another,

22:18.430 --> 22:19.630
what is this

22:19.930 --> 22:23.130
horrid virus which caused your demise?

22:24.030 --> 22:25.330
Anyone else feeling itchy?

22:25.530 --> 22:26.730
Maybe that's a bug bite.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.130
Or a rat bite.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.430
No, no, no, look at that spot.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.430
- It's a freckle.
- It's not a freckle.

22:32.530 --> 22:34.730
- Freckle.
- Never had a freckle there.

22:34.765 --> 22:36.330
You've always had that freckle.

22:37.230 --> 22:39.741
How would you know whether I had
a freckle or didn't have a freckle?

22:39.765 --> 22:41.565
And by the way, I have
never had that freckle!

22:42.330 --> 22:43.430
Yes, Jethro?

22:43.630 --> 22:45.695
Give me the symptoms
for hemorrhagic fever.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.030
Well, initially, one
might experience a feeling

22:48.130 --> 22:50.895
paranoia and a growing sense of dread.

22:50.930 --> 22:55.030
Then, more obvious physiological
symptoms would manifest themselves.

22:55.530 --> 22:56.495
Such as?

22:56.530 --> 22:59.730
Such as the appearance
of atopic melanosomes.

23:00.030 --> 23:01.095
Come again?

23:01.130 --> 23:03.430
Spots. Possibly itchy.

23:03.630 --> 23:06.230
Then, a fast-rising fever, of course.

23:06.930 --> 23:08.730
I knew it. I'm gonna die.

23:08.830 --> 23:10.630
I inhaled it. God!

23:12.130 --> 23:14.595
Definitely didn't picture
my demise like this. I always

23:14.630 --> 23:17.230
figured I'd go out like Cagney
in White Heat. Fiery explosion.

23:17.330 --> 23:20.130
Or Redford and Newman in
Butch Cassidy hail of bullets.

23:20.230 --> 23:21.930
Or Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush.

23:22.430 --> 23:23.530
How did he die?

23:23.830 --> 23:24.930
Silently.

23:28.030 --> 23:29.030
Ziva!

23:38.330 --> 23:40.230
- Didn't you see that?
- See what?

23:40.430 --> 23:42.130
Someone, something was running.

23:43.730 --> 23:45.930
Surely I'm not the
only one who saw that.

23:45.965 --> 23:47.030
The Chimera?

23:47.330 --> 23:49.430
I swear there was something there.

23:49.730 --> 23:50.830
It's not here now.

23:51.030 --> 23:54.330
It ran down the passageway, it
made a right here and then it...

23:55.830 --> 23:56.830
And then?

23:57.530 --> 23:58.630
It disappeared.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.230
I know there was something there.

24:00.330 --> 24:01.530
Like my freckle!

24:03.830 --> 24:04.830
Boss?

24:06.630 --> 24:07.730
Biohazard.

24:08.230 --> 24:09.230
Sounds inviting.

24:09.830 --> 24:10.830
McGee?

24:12.530 --> 24:14.330
Looks like some kind of cyber-lock

24:14.730 --> 24:16.630
with a bar code and touch memory.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.330
It's right up your alley, McGeek.

24:18.365 --> 24:19.530
It's going to take time.

24:20.030 --> 24:21.330
We're not going anywhere.

24:29.330 --> 24:31.330
Thought you said you
weren't going anywhere.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.730
If you want, Ziva I
could check you for spots.

24:37.765 --> 24:40.030
- No, thanks.
- I'm sure you've got hot spots,

24:40.730 --> 24:42.130
- warm spots...
- DiNozzo.

24:43.330 --> 24:44.430
Get this to Ducky.

24:45.130 --> 24:46.130
Me?

24:46.530 --> 24:47.730
That's a dead, diseased...

24:48.530 --> 24:49.530
rat...

24:51.030 --> 24:54.030
which is why it may aid Dr.
Mallard with his investigation.

24:54.430 --> 24:55.830
Which is why I'd be

24:56.230 --> 24:58.430
pleased as punch to
walk back through this

24:58.930 --> 24:59.930
ship with a...

25:01.030 --> 25:02.530
dead, diseased rat.

25:03.230 --> 25:04.630
You can show Ducky your freckle.

25:10.530 --> 25:12.030
You stinky, stinky.

25:18.030 --> 25:21.730
Yes, Alex, I'll take "Horror Films
That Take Place on Ships" for $500.

25:22.230 --> 25:23.230
Thank you.

25:25.230 --> 25:26.730
Oh, goodie. Double Jeopardy!

25:27.730 --> 25:28.930
Oh, geez.

25:30.230 --> 25:31.230
Oh, dear.

25:34.330 --> 25:35.530
Oh, crap.

25:44.830 --> 25:47.430
- I don't suppose you hear footsteps?
- Yeah, I hear 'em.

25:54.930 --> 25:55.930
It's just me.

25:56.630 --> 25:57.630
And Ben.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.530
- Bag that thing.
- Ziva?

26:01.730 --> 26:02.730
Thanks.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.630
Well, this moment is almost perfect.

26:06.665 --> 26:07.830
All we need is a storm.

26:16.030 --> 26:17.030
McGee?

26:17.130 --> 26:18.630
- Yeah.
- You all right?

26:20.430 --> 26:21.730
I've had better days, Boss.

26:22.230 --> 26:23.930
Tripped over a barrel.
Made this kinda...

26:24.130 --> 26:25.930
Bangy, crashy sound, like thunder?

26:27.530 --> 26:28.630
You crack the lock?

26:29.930 --> 26:31.130
No. Not yet.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.130
The touch screen... it's a bit...

26:33.830 --> 26:34.795
I'm working on it.

26:34.830 --> 26:36.830
Why don't you work on
turning the lights back on?

26:37.230 --> 26:39.230
I think we just passed
the electrical room.

26:41.630 --> 26:43.530
It's like Aliens. Numero Uno.

26:43.630 --> 26:44.730
Ripley, light in hand,

26:44.930 --> 26:46.380
moving through endless corridors

26:46.415 --> 26:47.830
searching for a hideous monster.

26:48.830 --> 26:50.330
You ever see Run Silent, Run Deep?

26:50.530 --> 26:52.230
The "run silent" part sounds good.

26:52.930 --> 26:54.930
The electrical room should be...

26:58.030 --> 26:59.130
right here.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.130
Let me out of here!

27:22.330 --> 27:24.130
Here's the crew list. He's the cook.

27:24.165 --> 27:25.730
Get these shackles off of me!

27:25.830 --> 27:27.795
- Why were you hiding?
- Why did you attack us?

27:27.830 --> 27:30.130
- Why'd the crew abandon ship?
- What happened to Takada?

27:30.165 --> 27:31.230
You asking me?

27:31.830 --> 27:33.630
It was that thing, wasn't it?

27:33.830 --> 27:35.530
What thing? I knew there was a thing.

27:35.630 --> 27:37.880
- What thing?
- They brought a thing out of the water.

27:37.915 --> 27:40.155
Takada was studying it. That's
what killed him. Isn't it?

27:40.430 --> 27:42.330
- Don't know.
- Don't lie to me!

27:43.230 --> 27:44.730
It's killing me, too, isn't it?!

27:44.830 --> 27:47.230
You know what if I don't
kill you first. Sit down,

27:47.265 --> 27:48.630
and tell us what happened here.

27:48.830 --> 27:50.030
What happened to the crew?

27:52.330 --> 27:53.430
They abandoned ship.

27:53.730 --> 27:54.495
Why?

27:54.530 --> 27:56.930
They thought whatever
killed Takada was contagious.

27:57.730 --> 27:59.630
Captain forced me to stay behind.

28:00.230 --> 28:02.530
He thought I had already been
exposed from all the blood

28:02.565 --> 28:04.730
- he puked on me.
- Nobody sent a Mayday.

28:05.130 --> 28:07.930
The radio operator was supposed to.
He was the last to leave the ship.

28:08.330 --> 28:09.630
So you were left here alone?

28:09.730 --> 28:10.730
I thought I was.

28:12.030 --> 28:13.230
And then someone hit me.

28:13.530 --> 28:14.295
Who?

28:14.330 --> 28:16.330
I don't know. They hit me from behind.

28:16.530 --> 28:18.130
Maybe they did, maybe they didn't.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.230
Why would I lie?

28:19.330 --> 28:21.330
- Why were you hiding?
- Why did you run?

28:21.630 --> 28:23.330
I thought you were the ones that hit me.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.530
There's someone else on this ship.

28:26.730 --> 28:28.130
What's in that biohazard room?

28:28.530 --> 28:29.995
Don't ask me. I'm just the cook.

28:30.030 --> 28:32.130
Come on! You never
overheard one conversation,

28:32.230 --> 28:34.030
one argument about
what's locked up in there?

28:34.130 --> 28:37.530
- That area was off limits to me!
- Sit down! You live with these people,

28:37.630 --> 28:39.330
you sleep with them, you work with them,

28:39.365 --> 28:41.030
you can't tell me what's in that room?!

28:43.530 --> 28:44.730
That's where it is.

28:46.230 --> 28:47.230
The bug.

28:50.430 --> 28:51.430
I don't get it.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.830
The breakers aren't tripped,

28:53.030 --> 28:54.530
the conduits are fine.

28:56.330 --> 28:58.230
Tony, check behind this panel over here.

29:04.530 --> 29:05.930
- Tony?
- Feel my head.

29:06.930 --> 29:07.930
Why?

29:08.230 --> 29:09.330
Just feel it.

29:12.730 --> 29:14.230
I don't want to. It's all sweaty.

29:14.830 --> 29:15.830
Exactly.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.930
I got the freakin' fever.

29:18.230 --> 29:19.330
I'm burning up, man.

29:19.830 --> 29:22.130
The ventilation is off,
Tony. We're all burning up.

29:22.165 --> 29:23.430
This is different.

29:26.330 --> 29:27.530
I'm dying, McGee.

29:29.030 --> 29:32.330
You know, the last time you
were dying of a horrible disease,

29:32.365 --> 29:34.630
you were a little bit more
stoic about the whole thing.

29:34.665 --> 29:35.730
I was younger then,

29:36.530 --> 29:37.530
carefree.

29:38.030 --> 29:39.130
It was two years ago.

29:39.830 --> 29:42.330
The last time I almost
died, someone blew up my car,

29:42.930 --> 29:45.130
so I've almost died twice,
and this is the third time,

29:45.330 --> 29:48.030
and bad stuff happens in
threes, and I'm out of almosts.

29:51.230 --> 29:53.130
I'm telling you, man,
this time I'm dying.

29:54.230 --> 29:55.230
I know it.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.930
But until...

30:05.430 --> 30:06.730
you are actually dead...

30:08.430 --> 30:10.130
can you please help me fix this thing?

30:13.730 --> 30:16.030
Go take a look behind
that panel over there,

30:16.430 --> 30:18.330
see if maybe one of the leads got fried.

30:20.030 --> 30:21.030
Thanks.

30:37.230 --> 30:38.630
I think I found the problem,

30:40.030 --> 30:41.030
assuming...

30:41.430 --> 30:42.895
this ship runs on

30:42.930 --> 30:44.130
tiny little batteries.

30:45.630 --> 30:46.630
Lithium.

30:47.030 --> 30:48.230
Like camera batteries.

30:48.530 --> 30:50.430
Odd. Someone must have
hidden them in there.

30:51.530 --> 30:52.530
Transponders.

30:52.930 --> 30:53.930
From what?

30:54.330 --> 30:55.830
Well my guess... EPIRBs.

30:57.830 --> 30:59.230
That's my guess, too.

31:00.230 --> 31:01.430
What are EPIRBs again?

31:03.330 --> 31:07.130
"Containment of aforementioned
microbial species, deadly or otherwise,

31:07.430 --> 31:10.730
is to remain under the guardianship
of the operation's chief scientist

31:11.030 --> 31:13.230
until such time it can
be safely transported

31:13.265 --> 31:14.630
to Naval Research Headquarters."

31:15.030 --> 31:18.130
Biowarfare research is
illegal. We signed a treaty.

31:18.330 --> 31:19.430
So did the Russians,

31:19.730 --> 31:22.530
and we've spotted their fishing
trawlers in areas of the Bering Sea

31:22.565 --> 31:24.030
that aren't considered fishable.

31:24.330 --> 31:26.930
So two wrongful fishing
expeditions make a right?

31:28.230 --> 31:30.530
We're just trying to get our
hands on the next generation

31:30.565 --> 31:32.930
of biological weaponry
before our enemies do.

31:33.230 --> 31:35.730
Do you file that under
deception or hypocrisy?

31:41.330 --> 31:42.630
Non-disclosure agreement.

31:46.030 --> 31:49.230
Do you understand why the Navy doesn't
want anyone to know where the ship is

31:49.330 --> 31:50.430
or what it's doing?

31:51.630 --> 31:55.630
And do you understand the Navy's
secret could cost my agents their lives?

31:55.930 --> 31:58.930
I got a support vessel on its way
with medical facilities on board

31:58.965 --> 32:00.330
and a decontamination unit.

32:00.730 --> 32:01.730
Great.

32:02.030 --> 32:03.030
Show it to me.

32:03.630 --> 32:05.430
How exactly do you propose I do that?

32:05.530 --> 32:08.530
There must be an ORION or two
that you could scramble overhead.

32:09.430 --> 32:11.030
I think you're gonna have to trust me.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.330
I don't know you well enough, Commander.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.330
We can fix that.

32:19.330 --> 32:20.530
You can cut the charm.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.730
Higher-ranking, richer,

32:22.930 --> 32:25.695
and definitely better-looking
men have tried that on me

32:25.730 --> 32:29.230
and didn't get very far. Now, I
can't speak for you, Commander,

32:29.730 --> 32:31.830
but I didn't get where
I am because of my looks,

32:31.930 --> 32:34.930
so get your eyes off of me
and put some on that ship.

32:48.830 --> 32:49.795
What's that?

32:49.830 --> 32:51.630
Transponders taken off the life jacket.

32:51.665 --> 32:52.595
Why I'd do that?

32:52.630 --> 32:55.030
You didn't want the crew
located once they abandoned ship.

32:55.065 --> 32:57.130
I didn't sabotage any life jackets!

32:57.330 --> 32:59.630
- There's no one else on the ship.
- There has to be.

32:59.730 --> 33:02.030
You were in the electrical
room when the power went out.

33:02.330 --> 33:04.130
I wouldn't know how
to shut off the power.

33:04.165 --> 33:05.530
I told you, I'm just the cook!

33:05.930 --> 33:06.930
Just the cook?

33:07.730 --> 33:09.630
That's what Steven Seagal
said in Under Siege,

33:09.665 --> 33:11.230
look at the havoc he wreaked.

33:11.630 --> 33:13.830
What about The Hunt for
Red October? The saboteur...

33:13.930 --> 33:14.930
was the cook.

33:17.030 --> 33:18.430
I'm sorry, boss, I'm just saying,

33:18.730 --> 33:20.680
that, you know, just
'cause he says he's the cook

33:20.715 --> 33:22.630
doesn't mean he's any
less potentially guilty.

33:23.030 --> 33:25.330
He could have slipped
poison into Takada's food.

33:25.530 --> 33:26.530
I swear,

33:26.830 --> 33:28.030
I didn't kill Takada!

33:28.730 --> 33:30.330
Not with poison, at least.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.095
The good news is I've confirmed

33:35.130 --> 33:38.430
beyond a doubt that Takada did
indeed die of hemorrhagic fever.

33:38.730 --> 33:40.230
That's great news, Ducky.

33:40.430 --> 33:43.130
However, the virus was
injected into him...

33:43.330 --> 33:44.930
it was not airborne.

33:45.030 --> 33:49.030
I've also examined the dead rat that
Tony so heroically brought to me.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.530
Ironically, it died from
having bitten Takada.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.430
So I'm not gonna die?

33:53.630 --> 33:56.630
Well, the bottom line is there
was no outbreak on the ship.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.595
He was injected without knowing it.

33:58.630 --> 34:00.930
If I could do a proper
and thorough toxicology,

34:00.965 --> 34:02.030
I think we'd find

34:02.530 --> 34:04.130
that he had first been drugged.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.730
Takada was murdered.

34:07.130 --> 34:08.429
Why would someone do that?

34:08.530 --> 34:10.030
To scare everyone off the ship.

34:10.330 --> 34:11.330
But why?

34:12.630 --> 34:14.630
I mean what's so valuable on this ship

34:15.130 --> 34:16.530
that someone would kill for it?

34:18.530 --> 34:19.530
About time, McGee.

34:20.730 --> 34:22.080
I had nothing to do with it.

34:22.114 --> 34:23.429
Someone's messing with us.

34:24.030 --> 34:25.179
Maybe Mitas is right.

34:25.215 --> 34:26.330
Someone else is aboard.

34:27.530 --> 34:28.630
Gibbs, up here!

34:33.530 --> 34:35.030
I saw something running on deck.

34:35.065 --> 34:36.195
Something or someone?

34:36.230 --> 34:38.530
- I don't know, it was moving fast.
- It or him?

34:38.565 --> 34:39.929
I don't know, I have lost it.

34:40.429 --> 34:41.530
I'll say.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.630
- Gibbs, I swear...
- I believe you, Ziva.

34:44.929 --> 34:47.230
See? Someone else who believes
in what they cannot see.

34:47.264 --> 34:49.830
No, I believe what I can
see wasn't there before.

34:55.730 --> 34:57.130
Someone's sending a signal.

35:06.630 --> 35:07.630
I believe you.

35:20.530 --> 35:21.830
Mitas was telling the truth.

35:22.330 --> 35:25.230
He's not a ghost, but he's got a
certain "B horror flick" thing going.

35:25.265 --> 35:26.930
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

35:26.965 --> 35:28.030
I think we do...

35:28.930 --> 35:30.230
Lieutenant Ferris.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.730
Communications Officer.

35:33.030 --> 35:35.430
Who failed to communicate
his crewmates abandoned ship.

35:35.730 --> 35:37.895
You're not very good at
your job, are you Lieutenant?

35:37.930 --> 35:40.141
- You're wasting your time.
- I think we're wasting yours.

35:40.165 --> 35:42.006
The Navy's on its way.
You're going to the brig.

35:42.030 --> 35:45.230
- You'll be dead before they arrive.
- Save it. We know about the virus.

35:45.330 --> 35:46.430
Outbreak was a hoax.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.830
It's not the virus that'll kill you.

35:51.930 --> 35:53.030
Satisfied, Director?

35:53.830 --> 35:55.130
I'm not that easy, Commander.

35:55.530 --> 35:56.830
That doesn't surprise me.

35:59.330 --> 36:00.830
That must be your support vessel.

36:01.030 --> 36:02.130
Can we get any closer?

36:02.430 --> 36:03.530
I'm sure we can.

36:08.730 --> 36:12.130
It's going to reach the Chimera a
lot faster than you said it would.

36:14.030 --> 36:15.430
That's not our support vessel.

36:24.394 --> 36:27.094
The approaching craft has
no known identification.

36:27.394 --> 36:29.594
That seems to be the way
things operate around here.

36:30.094 --> 36:32.194
Looks to be the size of
a small assault vessel.

36:32.394 --> 36:34.494
Same type of boats I've
seen used by marauders.

36:34.894 --> 36:36.594
- Pirates?
- Cruise ships,

36:36.694 --> 36:37.959
tankers, steamers...

36:37.994 --> 36:39.694
they'll attack anything to make a buck.

36:39.994 --> 36:40.994
How long?

36:41.094 --> 36:43.094
You should be able to
put eyes on it any minute.

36:43.294 --> 36:45.194
These people come heavily
armed, Agent Gibbs.

36:45.229 --> 36:47.459
Automatic weapons, grenades, even RPGs.

36:47.494 --> 36:49.894
- What are they after?
- I can't divulge that information.

36:49.929 --> 36:50.759
Hold on.

36:50.794 --> 36:53.194
You tell me heavily armed
pirates are coming to attack me,

36:53.229 --> 36:55.194
you better tell me what
they're looking for.

36:55.394 --> 36:56.794
Your agent hasn't been read in.

36:56.894 --> 36:59.194
I don't give a damn about
your secrets, Commander.

36:59.294 --> 37:01.094
I care about keeping my team safe.

37:01.494 --> 37:02.694
Tell me what they want.

37:02.794 --> 37:04.094
I can't do that.

37:04.294 --> 37:06.094
Can someone give me a damn answer?

37:06.694 --> 37:08.594
- Put me through to STRATCOM.
- All right!

37:08.794 --> 37:09.794
Wait!

37:09.894 --> 37:10.894
Look.

37:11.894 --> 37:14.794
The secret material they have
dredged up from the ocean...

37:14.894 --> 37:17.494
What am I looking for? Something
the size of a bread box?

37:17.529 --> 37:18.559
A gallon drum?

37:18.594 --> 37:19.794
It can fit in a vial.

37:20.194 --> 37:21.294
But it's untested.

37:21.694 --> 37:24.494
- Unproven.
- Ferris has already killed one guy.

37:24.794 --> 37:26.294
He's put 20 others at risk.

37:26.694 --> 37:28.294
This is worth something to someone.

37:28.594 --> 37:29.794
Boss, I cracked it.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.294
Now, before we go in there,

37:36.594 --> 37:38.994
the power is back on, so the ventilation

37:39.094 --> 37:41.594
and filtration system
should also be back on.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.459
I know it says "biohazard,"

37:43.494 --> 37:45.694
but if there's anything
biological in there,

37:45.994 --> 37:47.894
the room should be negatively pressured.

37:48.094 --> 37:49.294
Thing is, this...

37:50.494 --> 37:51.794
room is not.

37:52.994 --> 37:53.994
Boss...

37:55.194 --> 37:58.494
You-you really could risk exposure
if you stay in there very long.

38:05.894 --> 38:06.894
What is it?

38:07.794 --> 38:08.794
Gibbs!

38:10.394 --> 38:12.094
We've spotted the assault craft.

38:12.294 --> 38:13.994
Five minutes, maybe less.

39:52.894 --> 39:53.994
Aleksei?

40:04.594 --> 40:05.694
Aleksei?

40:17.094 --> 40:18.194
Ferris.

41:31.494 --> 41:33.494
Ducky, how long before Ferris wakes up?

41:33.594 --> 41:34.794
A couple of hours.

41:34.994 --> 41:38.894
It'll take him considerably
longer to wipe off the fake blood.

41:39.194 --> 41:40.994
How'd you disable the ship, McGee?

41:41.294 --> 41:42.594
Spew all over the engine?

41:42.794 --> 41:44.894
Steering has several
nonlinear effects...

41:45.194 --> 41:46.294
saturation,

41:46.494 --> 41:47.794
dead-zone, rate-limiting...

41:48.594 --> 41:51.094
Bottom line is, ship's still able...

41:51.194 --> 41:52.794
able to sail in one big circle.

41:52.894 --> 41:53.894
Russian.

41:55.794 --> 41:57.294
Orders from the Russian Navy.

41:57.694 --> 41:58.894
They weren't pirates?

41:59.094 --> 42:01.394
Soviet state-sponsored pirates.

42:01.994 --> 42:02.994
But why?

42:03.294 --> 42:04.294
McGee?

42:07.994 --> 42:09.594
Russian nuclear warhead?

42:09.694 --> 42:10.959
There's your ghost, Ziva.

42:10.994 --> 42:13.794
The ghost of Soviet Project K629.

42:14.094 --> 42:17.994
So, this whole thing was a Russian
black ops mission to recover their nuke?

42:18.194 --> 42:22.094
So, pirates that weren't really pirates
but were actually Russian sailors

42:22.129 --> 42:24.994
were on a covert mission to
steal a Navy research ship

42:25.029 --> 42:27.594
that wasn't actually
a Navy research ship

42:28.094 --> 42:30.794
in order to get back nuclear
weapons that we thought

42:31.094 --> 42:32.594
they didn't think we had retrieved?

42:34.694 --> 42:36.394
Perhaps we should call the Navy.

42:36.694 --> 42:38.894
Tell them that we're on
the Russian black ship,

42:38.994 --> 42:40.694
and the Russians are on theirs.

42:52.894 --> 42:56.094
I guess the Navy didn't want anyone
to know their black ship ever existed.

42:56.394 --> 42:58.294
How did they know we were off the ship?

42:59.494 --> 43:00.894
Don't think they did.
