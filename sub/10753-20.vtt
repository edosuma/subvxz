00:07.765 --> 00:11.644
- Hello, Rachel.
- (Rachel) 'Thanks for taking my call.

00:11.982 --> 00:15.577
'I'm involved in a strange love triangle.'

00:15.906 --> 00:19.615
- This is sweeps week!
- 'l recently married a widower.

00:19.956 --> 00:23.631
'Phil is a real good man, he's a kind man.

00:23.964 --> 00:25.920
'But there's one problem.

00:26.177 --> 00:29.249
'He insists on keeping an urn
with his late wife's ashes

00:29.559 --> 00:34.474
- 'on the dresser in our bedroom.'
- That is a definite "yikes".

00:34.861 --> 00:37.329
'l knew that wasn't normal!
He says it is...'

00:37.617 --> 00:41.610
Rachel, before you go off half-cocked,
let's try to remember,

00:41.958 --> 00:43.869
this is a sensitive issue
for your husband.

00:44.129 --> 00:46.643
Those ashes mean a lot to him.

00:46.927 --> 00:49.805
It's not appropriate
to keep them in the bedroom,

00:50.100 --> 00:52.330
but you could move them
to another room.

00:52.605 --> 00:56.280
'l could try that. Maybe I'll move them
into the guest room.'

00:56.613 --> 00:57.966
(Crash)

00:58.199 --> 00:59.951
'Oops!'

01:01.957 --> 01:06.553
- What happened?
- 'Oh, nothing. I'd better run, Dr Crane.

01:06.925 --> 01:09.803
'I've got some vacuuming to do.'

01:10.098 --> 01:14.888
As Rachel helps
Phil's first wife off the floor,

01:15.275 --> 01:18.347
we're at the end of our second hour.
We're back after the news.

01:18.657 --> 01:23.333
Please join me, Frasier Crane,
and my invaluable producer...

01:24.919 --> 01:28.355
...uh...uh...

01:28.677 --> 01:31.510
- Roz!
- Roz.

01:34.480 --> 01:37.950
KACL talk radio, 780AM.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.357
Roz, I'm so sorry!

01:42.622 --> 01:46.012
Your name was in front of me,
and I couldn't put my finger on it!

01:46.337 --> 01:50.250
- Forget about it.
- It's been happening to me a lot lately.

01:50.595 --> 01:55.225
Last night I walked into the kitchen,
and I couldn't remember what for.

01:55.605 --> 01:58.915
- Don't make yourself crazy. It's normal.
- OK.

01:59.238 --> 02:01.593
Your hairstylist
confirmed your appointment.

02:01.868 --> 02:04.177
I don't remember making one.

02:04.456 --> 02:07.095
You didn't. I was just gaslighting you.

02:08.506 --> 02:10.622
- That is not funny!
- Oh, lighten up.

02:10.886 --> 02:13.764
- Here, sign these.
- All right.

02:14.811 --> 02:17.883
Will you say it
or make me wait till the end of the day?

02:18.192 --> 02:20.581
- Say what?
- "Happy birthday."

02:20.865 --> 02:22.821
It is not your birthday.

02:24.747 --> 02:30.026
Oh, God, it is! Oh, Roz, I'm so sorry!
Let me take you out after work, OK?

02:30.425 --> 02:34.498
- You are so easy!
- Oh, that's it! I'm out of here!

02:34.851 --> 02:38.639
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- No, I am not!

02:38.984 --> 02:41.942
You can't blame a girl for trying.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.550
Five, four, three, two...

02:46.917 --> 02:49.147
We're back.

02:51.968 --> 02:53.924
(Growling)

02:55.809 --> 02:57.208
Ten.

02:57.437 --> 02:58.631
15-2.

02:58.857 --> 03:04.727
No, Eddie, no. Dad, ask your dog
to stop burrowing at my shoes.

03:06.455 --> 03:10.209
It took six months to have them sent
from a blind cobbler in Seville.

03:11.632 --> 03:16.660
- He won't stop till you scratch him.
- Oh. All right, Eddie, all right.

03:23.239 --> 03:28.154
You know, I'm beginning to think
I have an affinity for animals.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.657
Would you mind
if I noodle at the piano?

03:30.921 --> 03:34.470
- Would it stop you if we said, "yes"?
- Point well taken.

03:36.056 --> 03:40.208
(# BEETHOVEN:
"Sonata No 5, Op 10, No 1 ")

03:41.609 --> 03:43.600
(Hits clinker)

03:43.864 --> 03:48.380
That's strange. For the life of me,
I can't remember the next note.

03:54.009 --> 03:55.920
(Hits clinker)

03:57.265 --> 03:59.256
I know this backwards and forwards!

03:59.519 --> 04:03.432
Perhaps if you start at the end,
you'll have better luck.

04:12.128 --> 04:14.084
(Wrong notes)

04:14.341 --> 04:18.300
Oh, come on. You know how it goes.
It goes: da-da-da-da...

04:18.641 --> 04:22.190
Oh, thank you, Dad.
Now it's perfectly clear(!)

04:24.194 --> 04:26.150
(Fumbles)

04:28.954 --> 04:33.391
That was very nice, Son. How about
something from "South Pacific"?

04:34.924 --> 04:38.712
I'm sorry, I'm just getting fed up
with this nonsense.

04:39.057 --> 04:44.006
I keep forgetting names. Last week,
twice I forgot where I parked my car.

04:44.401 --> 04:47.074
Join the club, pal. You're getting older.

04:47.365 --> 04:51.404
Of course I'm getting older.
We all are. I'm not that old.

04:51.749 --> 04:55.139
I'm afraid Dad may have a point.
I know you'd like to believe

04:55.465 --> 04:59.617
we're still the same devilish sprigs
we always were,

04:59.974 --> 05:02.568
sitting on mother's davenport
in our tweeds and tams

05:02.855 --> 05:05.369
listening to the
"Texaco Symphonic Hour".

05:07.823 --> 05:11.418
But the cold, hard reality
is you're middle-aged.

05:11.747 --> 05:16.582
I'm 41. That's hardly middle-aged.
Middle-aged is more like 50, 55.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.922
Only if you live to be 110.

05:20.390 --> 05:22.824
I'm ready to go.

05:23.104 --> 05:25.937
- Where are you off to?
- I'm giving Daphne a lift.

05:26.235 --> 05:30.751
I'm meeting me friends for darts
and a few pints. It's best in that order.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.998
Just ask Blind Willie, the bartender.

05:35.838 --> 05:39.228
Before you go,
I'd like to ask you a little question.

05:39.553 --> 05:44.786
When you look at me, do you see me
as a young man or as an older man?

05:45.189 --> 05:48.784
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not getting me into that Vietnam.

05:50.033 --> 05:53.548
There are three questions
you never answer honestly:

05:53.874 --> 05:55.830
"How old do I look?",
"Do you like me hair?",

05:56.086 --> 05:58.395
and "Was it good for you, too?"

05:59.801 --> 06:02.235
Coming, Dr Crane?

06:04.603 --> 06:06.355
Dr Crane?

06:07.734 --> 06:10.373
I'm sorry, I was someplace else.

06:11.825 --> 06:13.975
It was a warm and friendly place.

06:24.894 --> 06:29.331
Big surprise, I got a headache.
I need to get an aspirin.

06:29.694 --> 06:33.926
The very suggestion
that I'm descending into old age...

06:34.287 --> 06:39.202
Just because I can't remember
some names and a tune on the piano.

06:41.009 --> 06:43.887
Your arm's not long enough
for that, is it?

06:44.182 --> 06:46.377
Let me ask you a few questions.

06:46.645 --> 06:51.082
Can you get through the night
without having to go to the john?

06:51.447 --> 06:56.202
Can you get in and out of a chair
without going, "Arrrgh"?

06:56.582 --> 07:01.975
Can you eat a slice of pizza less than
twelve hours before you go to bed?

07:02.385 --> 07:06.264
- What's on the pizza?
- Ah, I thought so.

07:06.602 --> 07:10.595
Now that we've established
you're middle-aged, take some advice.

07:10.944 --> 07:13.174
Don't fight it. It'll go a lot easier.

07:13.449 --> 07:16.168
Are you suggesting
I'll rush off to a surgeon

07:16.455 --> 07:18.730
for an eye lift and a chin tuck?

07:19.002 --> 07:21.391
Oh, dear God!

07:21.673 --> 07:24.346
When guys get to this stage,

07:24.638 --> 07:27.277
they do things
they would never have done before.

07:27.560 --> 07:29.516
Dad, please spare me.
I am a psychiatrist,

07:29.773 --> 07:33.448
- I know the routine.
- Who is that?

07:33.781 --> 07:37.137
That's me, in '74,
going through my own little stage.

07:37.455 --> 07:41.528
I died my hair black, bought a
leather jacket and a Harley Davidson.

07:43.592 --> 07:46.664
My God, Dad,
you look like one of the Village People.

07:48.811 --> 07:52.326
I came to my senses before you
got back from Harvard that summer.

07:52.652 --> 07:57.931
- Are those love beads?
- All right, that's enough.

07:58.330 --> 08:03.882
Just keep your guard up,
and don't do something stupid, all right?

08:04.301 --> 08:06.451
- OK, Dad.
- You might think it's tough

08:06.722 --> 08:09.919
being middle-aged, but think about me.

08:10.229 --> 08:12.743
I got a son who's middle-aged.

08:15.531 --> 08:17.487
(Groans)

08:17.744 --> 08:19.894
(Dad)
'l heard that.'

08:27.222 --> 08:29.816
Didn't this use to be Pinsky's store?

08:30.102 --> 08:33.936
- No idea.
- We'd bring you kids here all the time.

08:34.277 --> 08:37.553
Man, it was a great store.
You could buy lingerie,

08:37.866 --> 08:41.063
a bag of popcorn and transmission fluid,
all under the same roof.

08:42.251 --> 08:44.686
Finally something I'm glad I forgot.

08:46.218 --> 08:48.778
I believe I came here on a mission.

08:49.057 --> 08:52.254
I don't want anything fancy
or that comes in tubes.

08:52.564 --> 08:55.032
I want them white, plain and boxers.

08:56.280 --> 08:59.795
That kind of lack of imagination
sunk the British Empire.

09:01.999 --> 09:06.789
Check out these dress pants.
They got elastic panels in the waist.

09:07.176 --> 09:10.248
You can eat all you want
and not cut off your circulation.

09:12.270 --> 09:14.545
Milan must be beside itself.

09:15.651 --> 09:18.324
An innovative use of synthetic fibres.

09:18.616 --> 09:21.653
You can recycle these
and turn them into milk containers.

09:21.955 --> 09:24.025
You going to get them or not?

09:24.294 --> 09:27.206
You brought these over for me?

09:27.508 --> 09:30.944
The sands of time are shifting,
mostly south.

09:31.266 --> 09:34.736
Maybe you could go with suspenders.

09:35.065 --> 09:39.104
If you keep your jacket closed,
your gut can hang down to here.

09:39.449 --> 09:43.761
I do not have a gut! I have contours.

09:45.962 --> 09:48.795
Excuse me. Is anyone helping you?

09:49.094 --> 09:51.927
Oh, no!
She's looking at something with stripes!

09:52.225 --> 09:56.184
Daphne! Come on, let's go!

09:56.525 --> 10:00.677
You're not getting those, are you?
I have something much better here.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.069
What do you think of these?

10:03.330 --> 10:06.561
They could work on
a nice tall guy like you.

10:06.878 --> 10:11.269
- You really think so?
- Yeah, you've got a great build.

10:11.638 --> 10:14.710
- Thank you very much, uh...
- Carrie.

10:15.020 --> 10:17.136
- Carrie.
- Let's see.

10:17.400 --> 10:21.109
This is kind of a young look,
but you could really pull it off.

10:21.450 --> 10:24.408
I don't really think it's me.

10:24.706 --> 10:27.618
Are you sure?
This would look good on you.

10:27.920 --> 10:32.516
I could try it on. But just out of curiosity,
how old do you think I am?

10:32.889 --> 10:36.040
- I don't want to do that.
- No, please. Go ahead.

10:36.355 --> 10:39.472
I don't know, um... 36?

10:39.778 --> 10:41.928
Are you serious?

10:42.200 --> 10:46.432
Sorry, you're probably 34.
Now you don't want to buy anything.

10:46.792 --> 10:50.831
Are those Armani shirts expensive?

10:52.178 --> 10:54.248
- Yeah.
- I'll take two.

10:54.516 --> 10:57.952
- Great. Changing room's right this way.
- Ah.

10:58.273 --> 11:02.551
I love to guess what my customers do
by what they wear.

11:02.907 --> 11:06.502
- You're an architect, right?
- No, I'm a psychiatrist.

11:06.832 --> 11:11.667
Oh, I've taken psychology courses.
What are you, Freudian, Reichian?

11:12.050 --> 11:17.761
Lately, I've been leaning more towards
Jung because I'm "jung" at heart.

11:18.856 --> 11:21.006
The oldest joke in the shrinks' book.

11:21.653 --> 11:24.690
- Can't believe I said it.
- I can't believe I laughed.

11:24.993 --> 11:26.870
You must laugh at all customers' jokes.

11:27.122 --> 11:29.238
No, just the cute ones.

11:31.590 --> 11:35.981
- Cute jokes or customers?
- You figure it out.

11:45.409 --> 11:48.321
- You ready?
- I'm trying on some pants.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.616
Did you notice that girl that helped us?

11:51.922 --> 11:53.878
Sure. I'm not dead.

11:55.513 --> 11:57.469
We just had a little conversation,

11:57.725 --> 12:01.320
and I could swear
she was flirting with me.

12:03.737 --> 12:06.649
Trust me, Son, she's on commission.

12:07.954 --> 12:11.424
Oh, no, that was no sales pitch.

12:11.753 --> 12:15.871
She is definitely interested in me.
I'll have to see where this may lead.

12:16.220 --> 12:20.611
I know you're forgetting things,
but don't you remember our little talk?

12:22.316 --> 12:25.228
Oh, dear,
it sneaks right up on you, doesn't it?

12:25.531 --> 12:30.366
What am I thinking? A 41-year-old man
going out with a girl of 22, 23?

12:30.750 --> 12:34.663
- Young enough to be your daughter.
- Thanks for pointing that out.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.594
This is Dr Frasier Crane,

12:39.851 --> 12:43.082
KACL talk radio
thanking you for joining us today.

12:43.400 --> 12:49.032
Up next, Bob "Bulldog" Brisco
and the "Gonzo Sports Show"!

12:49.454 --> 12:53.891
Until tomorrow,
here's wishing you good mental health.

12:55.173 --> 12:59.564
Hey, Doc. Hear the news?
Ken Griffey Jr's groin pull is healed!

12:59.933 --> 13:02.970
Thank God.
We'll all remember where we were

13:03.272 --> 13:05.308
when we heard the joyful news.

13:05.569 --> 13:08.766
- Excuse me, Dr Crane?
- Hi, Carrie.

13:09.076 --> 13:11.874
- Hi, I have your pants.
- Whoa, Doc!

13:12.165 --> 13:14.360
(Toots a horn)

13:15.506 --> 13:17.940
- Where'd you leave them?
- They're new.

13:18.219 --> 13:20.938
Finer stores
deliver garments to their customers.

13:21.225 --> 13:24.137
We don't.
I just wanted to see you again.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.876
Excuse me. You look very familiar.

13:28.197 --> 13:31.826
Didn't I let you pour a flaming tequila
shooter down my throat

13:32.164 --> 13:35.474
at Sloppy Nick's
during last year's Indy 500?

13:35.796 --> 13:39.755
- Er, no.
- What you doing next Memorial Day?

13:40.096 --> 13:42.690
As certain as I am that any young lady

13:42.977 --> 13:46.652
would love to set your face on fire,
Carrie is here to see me.

13:46.985 --> 13:49.135
You can't blame a dog for trying.

13:50.409 --> 13:54.880
Just on the off chance it might make
a difference, I drive a '94 Camaro.

13:57.255 --> 14:00.088
Is he gay?

14:00.387 --> 14:04.778
I've been studying about this.
It seems like he's overcompensating.

14:05.146 --> 14:09.822
I'm not sure, but I look forward
to running that theory by him.

14:10.198 --> 14:14.908
Thank you for the pants.
Do I owe you anything?

14:15.291 --> 14:18.681
No, I enjoyed meeting
you yesterday,

14:19.007 --> 14:21.362
and we had a few laughs together.

14:21.638 --> 14:25.916
And maybe we could go out
and have a cup of coffee sometime.

14:26.272 --> 14:30.151
Listen, Carrie, I'm very flattered
that you'd like to go out with me,

14:30.489 --> 14:34.164
and you're a beautiful young woman...

14:34.497 --> 14:38.410
- But?
- Well, it's our ages. How old are you?

14:38.755 --> 14:40.905
22. How old are you?

14:41.176 --> 14:43.326
That's not polite.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.445
It wouldn't be appropriate for us to date.

14:47.732 --> 14:50.121
How about we just live together?

14:51.907 --> 14:54.899
I'm just lightening
an uncomfortable moment.

14:55.204 --> 14:58.992
- Ha-ha, well done.
- Well, I'm sorry,

14:59.338 --> 15:02.728
but if you change your mind,
you know where I am.

15:03.054 --> 15:07.332
- Enjoy your pants.
- Same to you.

15:13.825 --> 15:17.500
I only got a second here, but...
HELLO!

15:17.833 --> 15:20.666
ANYONE THERE?

15:20.965 --> 15:23.923
She wanted to go out with you!
You didn't have to chase her!

15:24.221 --> 15:26.177
You didn't have to harass her.

15:26.434 --> 15:29.904
You didn't have to pay her!
It was like a miracle!

15:31.235 --> 15:33.954
- She's too young!
- Are you following this?

15:34.241 --> 15:36.675
- I don't expect you to understand.
- I don't. You're not dating her?

15:36.955 --> 15:40.072
- No.
- Good. Maybe I can catch up with her.

15:40.378 --> 15:42.846
Maybe she's never dated
an ex-pro hockey player.

15:43.134 --> 15:45.602
You've never played hockey.

15:45.889 --> 15:48.801
It's like we're from different planets.

15:50.064 --> 15:52.100
- Talk about pathetic.
- Isn't he?

15:52.360 --> 15:56.638
- I meant you.
- You think I should go out with her?

15:56.995 --> 15:59.463
It's hard enough to find somebody.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.345
When an opportunity comes along,
grab it.

16:02.632 --> 16:06.227
- What about the age thing?
- What about it?

16:06.556 --> 16:11.152
You see an old man in the street
with a young girl, what do you think?

16:11.524 --> 16:14.243
I think he must be really rich.

16:15.991 --> 16:19.461
- Then I try to make eye contact.
- Ah.

16:25.511 --> 16:28.548
There you are, Frasier.
I'm so glad you called me.

16:28.850 --> 16:31.045
Thanks for coming.

16:31.856 --> 16:36.247
Maris's friends introduced me to
a party game I'd like to share with you...

16:36.616 --> 16:39.574
- I'd really like to talk.
- This first. It's a hoot.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.847
If you were on a desert island
with one meal,

16:44.131 --> 16:46.770
one aria and one bottle of wine,
what would they be?

16:47.053 --> 16:49.362
- Niles, I really...
- Frasier.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.678
OK.

16:51.980 --> 16:55.609
A Big Mac,
"I'm Your Venus" and Ripple.

16:58.660 --> 17:01.857
If you're going to mock the game,
don't play.

17:02.167 --> 17:06.160
- Gladly.
- Are you still cramped up about age?

17:06.508 --> 17:09.227
No, I'm fine. By the way, you were right.

17:09.513 --> 17:11.550
Oh, I love to hear that.

17:11.810 --> 17:16.441
Yes, but I do have a problem.
The other day I was asked out by, er,

17:16.820 --> 17:19.493
this 22-year-old girl
that I met in the mall.

17:19.786 --> 17:22.175
- That is alarming.
- I turned her down.

17:22.457 --> 17:24.811
In a mall? Did anyone see you?

17:26.131 --> 17:29.043
Niles. I'm just wondering
if I made the right decision.

17:29.346 --> 17:33.385
I would love to go out with this girl.
She's fantastic.

17:33.730 --> 17:37.882
But I could look like some old fool
chasing after a young girl,

17:38.239 --> 17:41.868
becoming a walking midlife crisis cliché,

17:42.205 --> 17:45.436
running around
like that buffoon Stanley Barrister.

17:45.754 --> 17:51.033
- Oh, that is embarrassing.
- That girl, how old can she be?

17:51.432 --> 17:53.468
- 21, if she's a day.
- Frightening!

17:53.728 --> 17:56.640
I saw them last Tuesday night together.

17:56.943 --> 18:02.017
- I saw them Wednesday morning.
- (Both) Ew!

18:02.412 --> 18:06.530
- That's disgusting!
- People will say the same about me!

18:06.880 --> 18:10.156
Stanley Barrister is a 60-year-old man

18:10.470 --> 18:12.426
who wears a toupee
that looks like something

18:12.683 --> 18:14.958
he pulled out of a shower drain.

18:16.190 --> 18:19.580
You are 41
and obviously not wearing a toupee.

18:22.035 --> 18:23.991
Thank you, Niles.

18:24.247 --> 18:27.557
- You think it's OK for me to date her?
- It doesn't matter.

18:27.880 --> 18:31.236
- I value your opinion.
- It's irrelevant.

18:31.553 --> 18:34.625
Don't be coy,
and please stop pursing your lips.

18:34.936 --> 18:38.895
You look like one of those old women
they carve out of dried apples.

18:41.281 --> 18:47.754
Don't you see? What I think about you
dating a younger woman is immaterial.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.680
- What matters is what you think.
- Hm...

18:50.968 --> 18:54.438
Would you be doing it
to run away from your age

18:54.767 --> 18:58.362
or because
this could become a relationship?

18:59.694 --> 19:02.254
- I don't know.
- Find out.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.649
- Then to hell with what people think.
- You are right.

19:05.956 --> 19:09.346
Oh! There it is again.
I never tire of hearing that.

19:09.672 --> 19:12.425
Let the tongues
of the doubting nabobs wag.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.871
- If it feels right, make yourself happy.
- Thank you.

19:16.185 --> 19:22.055
On a desert island, what would be
your favourite meal, aria and wine?

19:22.489 --> 19:26.038
The <i>coulibiac</i> of salmon at Guy Savoy,
"Vissi d'arte" from Tosca,

19:26.371 --> 19:29.841
and the Côtes du Rhône
Châteauneuf du Pape '47.

19:31.215 --> 19:34.048
You are so predictable.

19:43.405 --> 19:47.523
- Carrie, hi.
- Hi. I didn't expect to see you here.

19:47.873 --> 19:52.503
I could say I came down to shop,
but I came to see you.

19:52.883 --> 19:55.443
That's great.
I've been thinking about you.

19:55.722 --> 20:00.477
Me, too. I wanted to chat
about why we shouldn't go out.

20:00.857 --> 20:04.372
- OK.
- I thought I was in a midlife crisis.

20:04.698 --> 20:10.375
I was afraid if I dated you,
I would be trying to recapture my youth.

20:10.794 --> 20:15.822
I thought I asked you out
only because I was trying to work out

20:16.221 --> 20:20.373
some unresolved issues
about my father or something.

20:20.731 --> 20:23.450
So I went back and forth.
I felt like a fool...

20:23.737 --> 20:25.853
Me, too, back and forth.

20:26.116 --> 20:31.065
- Maybe you came along to fill a need.
- Or this could be something serious.

20:31.460 --> 20:36.454
Exactly. So, well,
I asked myself a few tough questions.

20:36.846 --> 20:39.838
- Me, too.
- I finally came to a decision.

20:40.144 --> 20:43.261
Me, too. I think us going out
would have been really stupid.

20:43.567 --> 20:46.081
Me, too!

20:48.035 --> 20:52.506
You and I would never have been
on a very firm footing.

20:52.878 --> 20:57.474
You knew all that, but you just
let me figure it out for myself.

20:57.846 --> 21:02.044
Yes, I'm sort of like the Wizard of Oz.

21:03.565 --> 21:07.353
It's no wonder everybody listens
to your radio show. You're so smart.

21:09.619 --> 21:11.610
Actually, I am full of crap.

21:12.793 --> 21:16.388
I had no idea you might be grappling
with personal issues.

21:16.717 --> 21:19.675
Some psychiatrist, huh?

21:19.974 --> 21:23.853
The truth is I came down here
to try to talk you into going out with me.

21:24.232 --> 21:27.030
I guess it's still a pretty bad idea.

21:27.322 --> 21:29.438
You're being so honest with me.

21:29.701 --> 21:33.296
That is such
an attractive quality in a man.

21:37.634 --> 21:41.752
Well, you know,
let's not go down that road again.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.693
OK.

21:45.441 --> 21:47.557
See you around.

21:49.491 --> 21:51.800
Bye.

22:05.356 --> 22:09.429
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.491 --> 22:12.163
# Quite stylish

22:12.412 --> 22:18.203
# Maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:19.592 --> 22:23.267
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.481 --> 22:28.790
# They're calling again

22:29.362 --> 22:33.913
# Scrambled eggs all over my face
What is a boy to do? #

22:36.084 --> 22:37.358
Good night!
