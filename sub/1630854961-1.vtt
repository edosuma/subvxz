02:02.208 --> 02:05.833
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's "Blind Date".

02:05.958 --> 02:09.583
And here is your host,
Miss Cilla Black!

02:30.375 --> 02:32.291
Thank you!

02:32.416 --> 02:34.166
Hello and welcome to "Blind Date",

02:34.291 --> 02:36.333
the show that tries
to find a boy and a girl

02:36.458 --> 02:38.625
who go together
like birds of a feather.

02:38.750 --> 02:41.541
Will the billing and cooing
lead to wooing?

02:41.666 --> 02:45.125
Or will the day they both met
be the day that they'll regret?

03:14.833 --> 03:16.000
It's been quite a week

03:16.125 --> 03:18.250
for clashes and confrontations
in the arts.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.666
The British Prime Minister,
Mrs Margaret Thatcher became

03:20.791 --> 03:22.541
the patron
of an admirable new scheme

03:22.666 --> 03:26.208
to get business and industry
to sponsor the arts at the same time

03:26.208 --> 03:29.333
as the Conservative Government
that she heads was under fire

03:29.458 --> 03:31.666
from prominent figures
in the arts world.

03:31.791 --> 03:35.041
The bone of contention is a clause,
Clause 28...

03:39.625 --> 03:41.625
If you're just joining us,
this is Peter Brackley.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.208
Welcome to "Sports Report".

03:43.333 --> 03:44.500
FA Cup, sixth round:

03:44.625 --> 03:47.416
Everton two, Ipswich Town one.

03:47.541 --> 03:49.208
Tottenham Hotspur nil,
Liverpool one...

03:49.333 --> 03:53.166
# Give me courage
When the world is rough

03:53.291 --> 03:57.500
♪ Keep me loving
Though the world is tough... ♪

04:10.375 --> 04:12.208
- What?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.208
I could forge your nan's signature
better, Siobhan.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.875
- But I didn't.
- Do you want me to call her?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.708
No. Don't.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.541
If there's a problem at home,
you can tell me, you know?

04:21.291 --> 04:23.791
Can't have my star player missing
any more matches, can I?

04:25.250 --> 04:27.916
- OK. I'll call her.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.791
You and your bloody fan club!

04:48.083 --> 04:49.666
Carol.

04:49.666 --> 04:51.708
Would you prefer
to take the class yourself?

04:52.916 --> 04:55.000
OK. Erm...

04:55.750 --> 04:58.291
Can anyone tell me
what "fight or flight" means?

04:59.833 --> 05:01.250
I'm not just talking about netball.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.333
"Fight or flight", any ideas?

05:08.333 --> 05:09.416
Carol?

05:09.416 --> 05:11.125
You can see me after, OK?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.500
There you go.

05:20.375 --> 05:21.791
Instincts.

05:21.916 --> 05:23.541
I'm talking about instincts.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.208
The body responds
far quicker than the brain.

05:27.041 --> 05:29.791
Faced with sudden danger,
the body begins to respond

05:29.916 --> 05:31.833
before the brain has even thought
about it.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.041
Steak pie, that, man.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.250
What you having for dinner?

05:37.375 --> 05:39.708
Don't, man, honestly.
Martin's got us on this new diet.

05:39.833 --> 05:42.333
Have you heard of it?
It's called "SlimFast".

05:42.791 --> 05:45.000
Just one of these in the morning
and one at night.

05:45.125 --> 05:46.708
Martin says
I'll be wasting away by Easter.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.666
Oh, God. Ah, dear...

05:52.791 --> 05:53.833
Nah. This, man.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.291
- That's horrible.
- That's minging.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.916
I want that, though.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.375
- Hiya.
- Oh, hello.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.458
- How are you?
- Hiya! Yeah, OK.

06:53.250 --> 06:54.458
Hey.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.250
- Hiya.
- Hey.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.125
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

07:14.625 --> 07:17.125
- Oh, come on, Baby Jean.
- Right, stop... stop calling me that.

07:17.250 --> 07:18.333
- Come on.
- It suits ya.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.208
- Lightweight! Lightweight!

07:26.333 --> 07:28.291
This is exciting.

07:28.416 --> 07:29.458
Out my way.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.666
All right, then, love.

07:34.791 --> 07:36.583
Have a lickle stretch.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.958
- Excuse me.
- That's... I'm not having this.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.291
Oh, no. Oh... stop it.

07:55.416 --> 07:56.958
What? No way!

07:58.000 --> 07:59.333
Nice shot.

08:06.125 --> 08:07.125
There she is!

08:07.250 --> 08:08.541
I'm bored.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.375
It's not over
till the fat lady sings.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.458
Well, I'm the fat lady,
and I'm calling it!

08:13.583 --> 08:15.333
Now someone get us a drink!

08:15.458 --> 08:16.666
- Drink, drink, drink!
- Go on, Jean.

08:16.791 --> 08:17.833
- Your go.
- Your turn.

08:17.958 --> 08:19.333
- Me?
- Teacher, you won.

08:19.458 --> 08:23.583
- I got the last one.
- I know, but the winner gets the drinks in.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.333

08:27.833 --> 08:29.250

08:29.375 --> 08:30.500
Thanks, love!

08:30.625 --> 08:31.541
Hello!

09:15.875 --> 09:18.250
Oh, no. Please. No, not that again.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.291
I need it.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.708
You're sick in the head,
you know that, don't you?

09:23.833 --> 09:26.875
I would just like you
to imagine as you lie there

09:27.000 --> 09:31.666
that the body is powering down,
ready to sleep for the night.

09:31.791 --> 09:36.541
Allow thoughts to come and go,
but begin to notice the sensation

09:36.666 --> 09:39.708
of the muscles in your legs
switching off.

10:35.750 --> 10:38.208
Any second now,
she's gonna get clattered.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.583
He's gonna take her down
and she'll come crying to me.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.041
-  Why is he so boisterous?

10:43.625 --> 10:44.750
Look at that.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.958
- Well, that's a waste, isn't it?
- Why's that?

10:50.708 --> 10:53.833
Well, she'll not be needing footwork
like that on a netball court.

10:53.958 --> 10:55.291
Well,
you could always sign her on.

10:56.291 --> 10:58.666
And you'll take the boys
for netball, too, will you?

10:59.791 --> 11:01.250
I don't see why not.

11:17.625 --> 11:19.333
- Abigail Dawson.
- Yeah, Miss.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.291
- Mindy Singh.
- Yeah, Miss.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.333
Lois Jackson.

11:25.583 --> 11:26.875
Does anyone know where Lois is?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.416
-  Who?
-  Dunno.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.166
- Gary Blakefield.
- Here, Miss.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.416
Christopher... Lois!

11:34.541 --> 11:35.500
Lois?

11:35.625 --> 11:36.625
Come on in.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.625
I'm Miss Newman.
Have youse got your kit yet?

11:38.625 --> 11:41.041
- No.
- Er... that's OK.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.791
We'll find you something.
Michelle, do we...

11:42.791 --> 11:45.500
- Can I just watch?
-  Can you just watch?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.333
Is there something funny, Mike?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.583
- Nah, Miss.
- OK, then, grow up.

11:54.541 --> 11:56.375
Erm...

11:56.375 --> 11:58.208
Yeah, OK, you can sit this one out,

11:58.333 --> 11:59.791
but in future,
it's not really optional.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.250
I need you in two teams.
Jimmy, can you get over here?

12:06.375 --> 12:07.625
Mike, over there.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.416
Come on, then, guys.

12:12.541 --> 12:14.250
One, two, three, bulldog!

12:16.125 --> 12:17.833
That's it, Mike!

12:20.541 --> 12:23.208
Come on! One, two, three, bulldog!

12:27.666 --> 12:30.041
One, two, three, bulldog!

12:35.750 --> 12:37.958
Come by the office tomorrow.
I'll sort you out with some kit.

12:38.083 --> 12:39.083
All right?

12:42.625 --> 12:44.666
- You thought about joining the netball team?
- No.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.875
You could come along later
and get a feel for it, if you like.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.125
- Have you played?
- No.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.541
But I know you can't run
when you've got the ball.

13:00.166 --> 13:01.708
I reckon you'll be good at it.

13:01.833 --> 13:03.125
Nah, I'm good.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.041
Let me know if you change your mind.

13:31.875 --> 13:33.041
What?

13:35.541 --> 13:36.333
Nothing.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.541
Oh... really?
Am I distracting you?

13:41.666 --> 13:42.833
No.

13:43.958 --> 13:45.708
- Just quite loud.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.208
Oh, yeah?

13:48.500 --> 13:50.083
How loud?

13:51.000 --> 13:52.250
Sounds like you're snoring.

13:52.375 --> 13:53.666
- No, it doesn't.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.666
- Come on, show us what it's like.

14:02.375 --> 14:04.208
-  Ladies and gentlemen...

14:06.250 --> 14:07.833
Wow! OK.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.750
...Miss Cilla Black!

14:09.875 --> 14:11.666
Oh, no, no way.

14:11.791 --> 14:13.333
What?

14:13.458 --> 14:15.291
- No way. We're not watching that.
- Why?

14:17.708 --> 14:20.333
"Oh, Kevin! If you fall for me,

14:20.458 --> 14:23.208
I promise I'll suck your cock
every week

14:23.333 --> 14:26.000
and never ever emasculate you
in front of your friends."

14:27.666 --> 14:30.666
You do realise they fill our tellies
with this here to distract us

14:30.791 --> 14:32.333
from what's really going on?

14:32.458 --> 14:33.875
Such a conspiracy theorist.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.041
I'm telling you.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.166
Not everything is political.

14:38.291 --> 14:39.416
Of course it is.

15:12.583 --> 15:13.791
Who's that?

15:14.666 --> 15:16.041
How should I know?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.291
Erm...

15:19.541 --> 15:21.041
Er... hang on.

15:23.791 --> 15:24.708
Oh, shit.

15:28.708 --> 15:31.375
- What's going on?
- It's... it's my sister.

15:32.166 --> 15:35.041
Can you just... you know?

15:41.208 --> 15:42.458
Fuck.

15:45.833 --> 15:47.416
Sorry, Jeanie. I tried ringing.

15:47.416 --> 15:49.333
Erm... Tim's mam's been taken
to hospital.

15:49.333 --> 15:51.083
They think she might have had
a stroke.

15:51.208 --> 15:53.416
Could you watch our Sammy?
I don't think it'll be too long.

15:53.541 --> 15:55.625
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Of course, yeah, that's fine.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.500
Oh, really? Thank you so much.
You're a star.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.541
Yeah, we'll be OK, won't we, Sammy?

15:59.666 --> 16:02.416
Don't go all shy on us.
Say hello to Auntie Jean.

16:02.541 --> 16:03.375
If you're lucky,

16:03.500 --> 16:05.208
I'll let you watch cartoons
before bed.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.208
- How's that?
-  Thank you.

16:07.375 --> 16:08.375
- OK.
- Thank you.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.416
OK. Right, off you go.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.750
Love you! Bye!

16:12.875 --> 16:14.125
Bye. Bye-bye.

16:17.750 --> 16:19.500
His gran's just been rushed
to hospital.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.083
They didn't want to take him with them.

16:21.208 --> 16:22.333
Who's that?

16:22.333 --> 16:24.125
Sammy, this is my friend, Viv.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.500
Viv, this is Sammy.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.458
Hiya.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.458
You can watch telly for five minutes,
OK?

16:32.583 --> 16:34.166
And then I'll take you up to bed.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.041
Sorry.

16:39.875 --> 16:40.916
"Friend", is it?

16:43.291 --> 16:45.041
- Well, he's five.
- And?

16:46.041 --> 16:47.125
Don't.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.041
Don't what?

16:49.833 --> 16:51.875
Well, don't tell me how to be
with my own family.

16:54.666 --> 16:55.958
OK.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.666
I'll, er... call you tomorrow, then?

17:02.041 --> 17:03.166
OK.

17:05.541 --> 17:06.583
Enjoy your cartoons.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.958
"I like women to be feminine.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.666
"What is the most feminine thing
about you?"

17:24.666 --> 17:25.708
Hmm...

17:29.375 --> 17:31.250
Right, come on, then, Sam.
Bath time.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.000
It's not finished.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.333
I don't care.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.333
Quickly!

17:39.375 --> 17:40.625
Up you go.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.208
Hey. Stop that!

18:04.791 --> 18:06.666
Stop it! Right, that's it!

18:16.083 --> 18:18.083
Hey. Hey, it's OK.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.291
It's OK.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.833
I'm sorry.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.125
I shouldn't have yelled at you.

18:41.333 --> 18:42.583
Good boy.

18:48.375 --> 18:51.125
-  Shall we read a story? Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.541
What do you wanna read?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.166
Superman.

19:02.041 --> 19:03.833
Me, too.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.375
- Ready?
- Yeah.

19:08.500 --> 19:09.583
Come on, then.

19:40.458 --> 19:41.708
Hello?

19:43.083 --> 19:44.250
I'm sorry.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.000
Oh, yeah? What for?

19:48.833 --> 19:50.375
For being an idiot.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.583
Right.

19:54.375 --> 19:58.875
Meet me by the holiday park
on Blyth Road in half an hour.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.291
Why?

20:08.583 --> 20:09.583
What is it that scares you?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.500
- All of it.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.041
Well, you're not backing out now.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.708
- Are you OK back there?
- Look at the road!

21:07.041 --> 21:08.750
- Wait for me!

21:21.833 --> 21:24.000
Whoo!

21:27.208 --> 21:30.916
You can phone the organisers
on 0-1-8-3-7-6-6-6-6.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.875
That's 0-1, if you're calling
from outside London,

21:34.000 --> 21:36.750
8-3-7-6-6-6-6.

21:36.875 --> 21:37.916
Lucy?

21:38.041 --> 21:41.208
In Haringey, positive images
of homosexuality prompted

21:41.333 --> 21:44.125
a violent response
from protesting parents.

21:44.625 --> 21:48.125
The New Clause is a group
of Conservative MPs' response.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.916
The central provisions are
that homosexuality

21:51.041 --> 21:53.333
must not be promoted
in state schools,

21:53.458 --> 21:56.958
and it outlaws teaching
the acceptability of homosexuality

21:57.083 --> 21:59.958
as a pretended family relationship.
The bill...

22:00.083 --> 22:01.291
What does that even mean?

22:01.291 --> 22:03.666
"Pretended family relationships".

22:03.666 --> 22:07.541
The clause is expected to go through
substantially unchanged, not least...

22:07.666 --> 22:09.250
I found myself lying the other day.

22:11.375 --> 22:13.500
I had to call one of
the kids' parents and I got...

22:16.000 --> 22:17.250
I dunno.

22:18.791 --> 22:20.375
And I told her I was my boss.

22:22.416 --> 22:25.083
I didn't plan it or anything,
but I felt like if I had...

22:25.875 --> 22:29.083
...told her it was me,
she might think...

22:29.208 --> 22:31.208
There's something going on
between you two?

22:31.875 --> 22:33.250
Yeah.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.166
Between me and the kids.

22:36.500 --> 22:38.250
- It's stupid.
- No, it's not stupid.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.916
You know that's what they want,
though, don't you?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.416
- Right, love. What can I get you?
- Fish 'n' chips.

22:58.541 --> 23:00.958
- Do you want peas or beans with that?
- Er, peas, please.

23:01.083 --> 23:03.083
- Won't be long.
- She's friendly.

23:07.916 --> 23:10.500
This is not a beauty parlour.
Get cracking, please, ladies.

38:47.916 --> 38:50.916

by three young women,

38:51.041 --> 38:54.250
who launched a commando-style raid
on the chamber.

38:54.375 --> 38:56.791
They abseiled down ropes
from the public gallery,

38:56.916 --> 39:00.375
landed on the floor among
a chamber full of startled peers

39:00.500 --> 39:03.583
and were hustled out by Black Rod
and several doorkeepers.

39:03.708 --> 39:06.708
It was a protest against the clause
in the Local Government Bill,

39:06.833 --> 39:10.333
which curbs the promotion
of homosexuality by councils.

39:11.250 --> 39:15.500
We care on this side,

42:27.833 --> 42:30.875
No. We're not talking about me.

42:35.083 --> 42:36.916

42:46.958 --> 42:48.708
for that kind of behaviour.

42:50.000 --> 42:52.833
I know it seems unfair.

42:55.041 --> 42:56.750
But I'm trying to help you.

42:58.041 --> 43:01.416
If you want this,
fight for it, not against it.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.458
Hey...

43:04.458 --> 43:05.958
Hey, don't!

43:16.708 --> 43:18.583
Oh, no, what happened?

43:18.583 --> 43:20.291
Er, it was just a graze.

43:20.291 --> 43:22.500
- You all right, pet?
- I'm fine.

43:29.916 --> 43:31.291
Poor love.

43:32.166 --> 43:33.333
Yeah, she's OK.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.416
All sorts of rumours flying around
about that one.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.041
Not sure she helps herself, though.

43:40.958 --> 43:42.208
Everything OK with you?

43:42.916 --> 43:44.833
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, fine.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.291
Long day.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.208
Take it you don't wanna come
for a pint, then?

43:53.333 --> 43:54.958
One day.

43:55.083 --> 43:57.208
One day, I will crack you,
Jean Newman.

43:57.333 --> 43:58.333
And when I do,

43:58.333 --> 44:01.083
Fergus Shelton will be
a very happy man.

44:01.208 --> 44:02.583
- Yeah.

44:09.625 --> 44:13.583
My overriding concern is
the promotion of positive images

44:13.708 --> 44:17.041
of homosexuality in schools
and primary schools right through,

44:17.166 --> 44:19.083
and that is what is causing
many parents

44:19.208 --> 44:20.833
real concern and offence.

44:20.958 --> 44:23.833
I obviously don't want
children taught

44:23.958 --> 44:26.791
that the gay and lesbian lifestyle is
natural or normal.

44:26.916 --> 44:30.000
It is not, it never has been,
and it never will be.

44:30.125 --> 44:31.625
Children who need to be taught

44:31.750 --> 44:34.458
to respect traditional moral values

44:34.583 --> 44:38.833
are being taught that they have
an inalienable right to be gay.

45:27.625 --> 45:28.833
Here y'are, Jeanie.

45:30.958 --> 45:32.333
Can I have some?

45:32.458 --> 45:33.916
You won't like that, sweetheart.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.375
But I want it.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.875
Eat what you're given, OK, Sammy?

45:39.000 --> 45:40.000
But why?

45:40.125 --> 45:43.416
Well, Auntie Jean is allergic
to chicken.

45:44.458 --> 45:45.666
But we're not.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.125
Sammy.

45:50.583 --> 45:52.875
That is enough, Sam!

45:53.583 --> 45:57.083
We do not behave like that
in this house!

45:59.583 --> 46:01.666
What on earth
do you think you're playing at?!

46:01.791 --> 46:04.083
You've just wasted
perfectly good food...

46:04.208 --> 46:05.333
Sorry about this.

46:05.333 --> 46:07.083
I don't think so...

46:07.208 --> 46:08.375
It's OK.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.666
"At last, the Caterpillar took
the hookah out of its mouth

46:16.791 --> 46:19.333
"and addressed her
in a languid, sleepy voice."

46:23.833 --> 46:27.041
"'Who are you?'
said the Caterpillar."

46:28.000 --> 46:31.208
"This was not an encouraging opening
for a conversation.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.250
"Alice replied rather shyly,

46:33.375 --> 46:36.833
"'I hardly know, sir,
just at present.'"

46:36.958 --> 46:39.458
"'At least, I know who I was
when I got up this morning,

46:39.583 --> 46:42.125
"'but I think I must have been
changed several times since then...'"

46:42.250 --> 46:44.458
Come on, Sammy.
Let's go and play outside.

46:44.583 --> 46:47.000
But I don't want to.
Well, you've been inside all day.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.375
I'm gonna count to three.

46:51.166 --> 46:53.083
One, two...

46:53.208 --> 46:55.208
We'll finish it another time, OK?

47:20.833 --> 47:23.083
Can I show you something quickly
while they're out there?

47:23.208 --> 47:24.958
I bought something for Tim
for our anniversary,

47:24.958 --> 47:26.125
but I need a second opinion.

47:26.250 --> 47:27.833
Thought I'd asked you
to get rid of this.

47:27.958 --> 47:30.333
Ah, I love that one.
You look so happy.

47:32.333 --> 47:33.583
Yeah, I know, I know.

47:35.041 --> 47:36.083
Please.

47:36.208 --> 47:37.541
I don't have any recent ones.

47:38.333 --> 47:40.791
- And I miss your hair like that.
- You sound like Mam.

47:40.791 --> 47:42.833
How would you know?
You never go and see her.

47:44.041 --> 47:45.458
I don't like seeing it there.

47:47.375 --> 47:49.666
- What?
- I dunno, it's just...

47:50.833 --> 47:53.500
Well, it's not as if everything that
came before is, you know, a lie.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.208
What are you talking about?

47:56.333 --> 47:59.083
I don't think it's right
you wanna erase part of your life.

47:59.208 --> 48:00.583
And you expect us to.

48:00.708 --> 48:02.708
I thought I just asked you
to replace one photograph.

48:02.708 --> 48:04.708
- You know what I mean.
- Well, I don't, actually.

48:04.833 --> 48:07.041
You're trying to erase your marriage.

48:07.166 --> 48:08.208
Am I, now?

48:08.208 --> 48:09.666
Don't be a child.

48:16.458 --> 48:19.208
Why didn't you tell me
you weren't alone the other night?

48:19.333 --> 48:20.416
What?

48:20.416 --> 48:22.375
Sammy told me you had a woman there.

48:24.375 --> 48:26.750
Look, what you do in your own home
is your own business.

48:27.416 --> 48:30.500
You know I'm supportive of... it.

48:30.625 --> 48:32.541
But Sammy's only five.

48:32.666 --> 48:33.958
It's confusing for him.

48:35.041 --> 48:37.791
He wet the bed.
He never wets the bed.

48:37.916 --> 48:39.416
His grandmother had just
been rushed to hospital.

48:39.416 --> 48:42.375
I just don't think it's fair for you
to put me in that position.

48:44.333 --> 48:46.333
She actually left
right after you dropped him off.

48:46.458 --> 48:48.125
OK, but...

48:48.250 --> 48:50.541
Do you see? It's hard for me, well...

48:50.666 --> 48:51.833
to trust you.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.250
So...

49:00.708 --> 49:02.333
Come on, who is she, then?

49:09.791 --> 49:11.333
Got ya!

49:21.458 --> 49:24.416
- Bye, Auntie Jean!
- Bye!

49:24.541 --> 49:25.833
- Bye!
- Bye!

50:28.208 --> 50:29.875
- Hey.
- Hiya.

50:30.791 --> 50:32.208
What's wrong? You look stressed.

50:33.416 --> 50:35.041
- Thanks.

50:36.166 --> 50:37.500
Here.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.583
What's going on?

50:42.541 --> 50:44.125
Nothing. Just, erm...

50:44.250 --> 50:45.958
- shattered, you know?
- Oh.

50:46.083 --> 50:47.625
Well, maybe we should go away.

50:47.750 --> 50:50.333
Cos the girls and I were actually
talking about taking a trip...

50:54.291 --> 50:56.125
That a no, is it?

50:56.250 --> 50:57.833
Er, no. Er... no.

50:57.833 --> 50:59.666
Hey, lady.

50:59.791 --> 51:01.875
Hiya. Thanks.

51:02.916 --> 51:05.208
Wow, you seem... tense.

51:05.333 --> 51:06.458
That's what I said.

51:06.458 --> 51:08.541
Leave her alone, you lot.

51:10.208 --> 51:11.791
- Hey!
- 'Ey, the kid's good.

51:12.666 --> 51:14.458
Wanna play?

51:14.583 --> 51:16.250
Jean here's unbeaten.

51:16.250 --> 51:17.833
You can be on my team.

51:17.958 --> 51:19.416
Come on, it'll be fun.

51:19.541 --> 51:21.208
No, I don't... I don't really...

51:22.333 --> 51:24.291
- Can't take the heat.
- Come on, Jeanie.

51:29.750 --> 51:31.583
- Jeanie!
- Oi!

51:36.541 --> 51:37.541
Yeah!

52:08.750 --> 52:10.500
Ah, no! It's all over.

52:11.791 --> 52:12.791
Ooh.

52:12.916 --> 52:14.291
You can take it.

52:14.416 --> 52:16.125
No way. Finish her off.

52:30.291 --> 52:33.083
- Ohhh!
- She did it! She fuckin' did it!

52:35.083 --> 52:36.291
Got your loser speech?

52:50.875 --> 52:52.250
Hey!

52:52.250 --> 52:54.375
What are you doing?

52:54.500 --> 52:55.500
You need to leave.

52:55.500 --> 52:56.500
Why?

52:56.625 --> 52:57.916
You know why.

52:57.916 --> 52:59.250
Do whatever you want.

52:59.375 --> 53:00.833
Wherever you want.

53:00.958 --> 53:02.125
But not here, OK?

53:02.125 --> 53:03.541
Why do you care so much?

53:03.541 --> 53:05.541
You're 15.
You shouldn't even be in here.

53:05.666 --> 53:07.666
So what? Haven't told anyone, have I?

53:07.666 --> 53:09.416
Hey! Hurry up!

53:09.416 --> 53:11.791
Go. Otherwise, you're off the team.

53:11.791 --> 53:13.083
What?!

53:16.958 --> 53:18.250
Oh...

53:18.791 --> 53:20.041
Viv!

53:20.041 --> 53:21.458
Wait.

53:28.583 --> 53:29.666
Viv.

53:31.083 --> 53:32.500
Please!

53:32.500 --> 53:34.625
Just tell us what you were
doing in there so I know.

53:34.625 --> 53:36.583
She's one of my students,
she's on the team.

53:36.583 --> 53:37.833
What?

53:37.958 --> 53:39.791
- Are... are you...
- No. Course not.

53:41.583 --> 53:43.125
Then why didn't you say something?

53:44.458 --> 53:46.041
I don't know.

53:48.166 --> 53:49.916
- You're lying.
- I'm not. Look...

53:51.916 --> 53:53.125
It's complicated, OK?

53:55.375 --> 53:58.208
- I was asking her to leave.
- In the toilet?

53:58.208 --> 54:00.541
Why?
Why were you asking her to leave?

54:01.708 --> 54:04.250
I don't want my students
knowing every part of my life.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.333
-"Every part" of your life? What...
- Yeah.

54:07.791 --> 54:09.791
I don't know what you want me to say.

54:09.791 --> 54:11.791
You have to create boundaries
as a teacher.

54:11.916 --> 54:13.208
It is part of the job.

54:14.208 --> 54:16.833
If anyone found out,
I'd never work again.

54:18.125 --> 54:19.583
It's quite a stretch.

54:19.583 --> 54:21.458
- Don't you think?
- No. It isn't.

54:21.583 --> 54:23.333
- And what about her?
- Who?

54:23.333 --> 54:26.541
That girl.
Come on, how old is she, what, 16?

54:26.666 --> 54:27.875
15.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.000
What kind of example
are you setting for her?

54:31.250 --> 54:32.541
That's not fair.

54:33.333 --> 54:34.875
None of this is fair.

54:35.000 --> 54:37.583
Just cos I don't parade my sexuality
around like a badge of honour.

54:38.583 --> 54:39.666
And I do?

54:40.625 --> 54:41.791
Is that it?

54:43.041 --> 54:45.250
How is that girl ever gonna learn
she has a place in this world

54:45.375 --> 54:47.333
if you, of all people,
tells her that she doesn't?

54:47.333 --> 54:49.333
What makes you think
she has a place in this world?

54:55.125 --> 54:56.583
- No. I can't do this.
- Oh, Viv...

54:56.583 --> 54:57.958
GET OFF!

55:16.458 --> 55:18.958
♪ I see a ship in the harbour

55:20.166 --> 55:22.458
♪ I can and shall obey

55:23.166 --> 55:26.666

♪ Tell me now how should I feel?

56:03.208 --> 56:06.291
I would just like you
to imagine as you lie there

56:06.416 --> 56:11.083
that the body is powering down,
ready to sleep for the night.

56:11.208 --> 56:12.875
Allow thoughts to come and...

57:56.750 --> 57:58.166
Got a sec?

57:59.250 --> 58:01.458
Found something on your desk
when I got in this morning.

58:02.375 --> 58:04.125
Obviously,
with everything that's going on,

58:04.125 --> 58:07.333
I didn't want anyone else to see it.
But I thought you should know.

58:08.750 --> 58:10.416
Any idea who might have put it there?

58:10.541 --> 58:12.333
Erm...

58:13.458 --> 58:15.208
Er, yeah, I've got some ideas.

58:18.625 --> 58:20.208
Don't look so worried.

58:22.416 --> 58:24.125
I've had far worse in my time.

58:50.250 --> 58:51.791
I need to talk to you for a second.

58:52.708 --> 58:54.541
- Let me guess. I'm off the team?
- No.

58:54.666 --> 58:57.083
Look, I need this to stop.

58:57.083 --> 58:58.541
- What?
- All of it.

58:59.708 --> 59:02.916
This isn't a game, Lois.
It's my job. It's my life.

59:02.916 --> 59:04.833
What is it you think I've done?

59:04.958 --> 59:07.041
- You know exactly.
- Are you married or something?

59:07.041 --> 59:09.250
You think you're so brave, don't you?

59:10.375 --> 59:12.125
You don't know anything about me.

59:18.416 --> 59:19.291
Fuck!

59:19.416 --> 59:22.125
Good of you to join us, Lois.
Perhaps you'd like to tell us

59:22.250 --> 59:24.333
how many elements make up
the periodic table?

59:25.625 --> 59:27.000
- No?
- What did she want?

59:27.000 --> 59:27.833
Anyone?

59:27.958 --> 59:29.625
She's got a massive crush on me
and she won't drop it.

59:30.666 --> 59:32.958
Something you'd like to share
with the class, Lois?

59:33.083 --> 59:34.166
No, Miss.

59:34.291 --> 59:37.250
Right.
Textbooks open to page 93, please.

59:39.250 --> 59:40.375
Today.

59:59.208 --> 1:00:01.708
You don't actually think
it was hers, do you?

1:00:01.833 --> 1:00:03.333
I thought she was married.

1:00:03.458 --> 1:00:04.791
Divorced, apparently.

1:00:05.750 --> 1:00:07.000
I didn't realise.

1:00:08.083 --> 1:00:10.208
Who broke it off, do you know?

1:00:10.333 --> 1:00:12.375
She doesn't really talk about it,
to be honest.

1:00:13.666 --> 1:00:15.416
She's a secretive one, that one.

1:00:46.458 --> 1:00:48.875
Thought I might sit in
on practice today.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.083
- If you don't mind.
- Yeah. Course.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:55.375
Er, can we start with shuttle...

1:00:56.333 --> 1:00:58.041
...warm-up, please?

1:01:28.583 --> 1:01:30.583
OK, well done.
You can get your bibs.

1:01:36.791 --> 1:01:39.000
Miss? She took my bib.

1:01:39.666 --> 1:01:41.333
You can sub in for each other
at half-time.

1:01:41.458 --> 1:01:43.833
- But it's my position.
- It's just practice, Siobhan.

1:01:44.541 --> 1:01:45.541
- Give it back.
- Piss off.

1:01:45.541 --> 1:01:46.625
Give it back! Give it back!

1:01:47.666 --> 1:01:50.208
Enough! Both of you!
On the bench, now!

1:01:50.208 --> 1:01:51.416
- But...
- But she started it!

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:53.541
You answer back to me
and you're off the team, OK?

1:01:53.666 --> 1:01:54.833
Me? What about her?

1:01:54.958 --> 1:01:57.625
Both of you, on the bench, now!

1:02:15.208 --> 1:02:16.541
Here!

1:02:31.541 --> 1:02:33.000
What are you doing?

1:03:00.916 --> 1:03:02.208
It's OK.

1:03:28.041 --> 1:03:30.375
Get off me!

1:03:35.291 --> 1:03:37.250
Siobhan! Siobhan!

1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:39.541
- Are you OK?
-  Give her some space.

1:03:39.666 --> 1:03:41.916
Get her out. Come here.

1:03:41.916 --> 1:03:43.791
Sit down.

1:03:43.916 --> 1:03:45.291
What's going on?

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:50.291
Can someone tell me
what's going on, please?

1:03:51.416 --> 1:03:53.000
She attacked me.

1:03:54.083 --> 1:03:55.625
What do you mean she attacked you?

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:58.208
She shouldn't be allowed in here.

1:03:59.458 --> 1:04:01.041
Get her out! Get out!

1:04:02.541 --> 1:04:04.625
Get out, Lois!

1:04:05.791 --> 1:04:07.541
I'm gonna need you
to supervise this lot

1:04:07.666 --> 1:04:09.250
so I can get her out of here.

1:04:09.833 --> 1:04:11.083
Come on, darling.

1:04:18.291 --> 1:04:20.875
She said that she attacked her.
She needs to get kicked out!

1:04:41.416 --> 1:04:43.916
:
She's saying this isn't the first time.

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:47.583
That there was a fight
a few weeks ago

1:04:47.708 --> 1:04:49.125
that you didn't report.

1:04:50.958 --> 1:04:52.208
She's even gone as far as to say

1:04:52.333 --> 1:04:54.166
there might be something going on
between you two.

1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:56.416
You and Lois, that is.

1:04:57.666 --> 1:04:59.958
Jean, can you please tell me
what's going on,

1:05:00.083 --> 1:05:02.375
or am I gonna have to take
her word for it?

1:05:06.208 --> 1:05:07.708
Lois is, erm...

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:15.833
She's become a little over-attached,
you could say.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.333
If that's the case,
why didn't you report it to me?

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:24.000
I didn't think it was anything
to worry about.

1:05:26.375 --> 1:05:27.875
You know what they're like.

1:05:28.916 --> 1:05:30.375
I've had worse.

1:05:30.500 --> 1:05:31.958
And the changing room?

1:05:37.041 --> 1:05:38.458
I saw something but, erm...

1:05:38.583 --> 1:05:40.291
What? What did you see?

1:05:44.583 --> 1:05:46.041
I saw them together.

1:05:47.916 --> 1:05:49.541
Siobhan pushing Lois off.

1:05:53.333 --> 1:05:54.791
Now, Miss Murphy,

1:05:54.916 --> 1:05:57.250
it's very important that we ascertain
exactly what went on

1:05:57.375 --> 1:06:00.166
between you and Miss Jackson
earlier today.

1:06:00.291 --> 1:06:03.416
We take these kinds of accusations
extremely seriously.

1:06:03.541 --> 1:06:06.750
The perpetrators of sexual assault
have no place in this school.

1:06:07.750 --> 1:06:09.250
Now, I don't want to keep you long.

1:06:09.250 --> 1:06:12.083
I just need you to repeat
what you told the PE staff

1:06:12.208 --> 1:06:13.791
earlier this afternoon.

1:06:19.416 --> 1:06:20.750
I don't remember.

1:06:22.666 --> 1:06:25.916
Look, I know it isn't easy for you.

1:06:26.708 --> 1:06:28.458
So let me try and help, OK?

1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:34.166
Earlier, today, if you remember,
you were very upset.

1:06:35.666 --> 1:06:39.000
I was in the hall
when I heard you scream.

1:06:39.125 --> 1:06:41.458
I then ran into the changing room,

1:06:41.583 --> 1:06:44.208
where I found you in the corner
very distressed.

1:06:44.333 --> 1:06:45.500
I took you to my office,

1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:48.208
where you told me
that Lois had assaulted you.

1:06:48.333 --> 1:06:49.583
Is that right?

1:06:49.708 --> 1:06:52.041
No, it's not. Tell them!

1:06:52.166 --> 1:06:53.208
Lois!

1:06:53.208 --> 1:06:55.416
I'll need you to calm down.

1:06:59.083 --> 1:07:02.291
Just nod if that's what happened,
my love.

1:07:12.166 --> 1:07:13.750
You just have to nod, my love.

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:18.541
Well done.

1:07:19.791 --> 1:07:21.416
I see.

1:07:22.833 --> 1:07:25.458
You were there, Miss Newman?
You saw what happened?

1:07:27.416 --> 1:07:29.208
Yeah, I did, yeah.

1:07:31.958 --> 1:07:33.250
Right.

1:07:35.250 --> 1:07:37.625
- What is wrong with you?
- Er, that's enough, Lois.

1:07:37.750 --> 1:07:39.416
I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to call your father.

1:07:39.541 --> 1:07:41.625
- Don't bother.
- Er, sit back down, please.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:44.208
Do you know, you haven't even
asked me what happened.

1:07:44.333 --> 1:07:46.666
You've asked all of them but not me.

1:07:47.583 --> 1:07:49.750
If you've got something to say...

1:07:52.708 --> 1:07:54.250
You're the worst of the lot.

1:07:54.916 --> 1:07:56.500
And you know it.

1:08:03.333 --> 1:08:04.708
Let her go.

1:08:11.666 --> 1:08:14.375
One, two...  Lovely.

1:08:14.500 --> 1:08:16.416
I lose track.

1:08:16.541 --> 1:08:18.041
Actually, no, I lie.

1:08:18.750 --> 1:08:21.333
He'd just turned two there.
It was election night.

1:08:21.458 --> 1:08:23.458
Me and Bill were glued to the TV.

1:08:23.583 --> 1:08:25.500
Didn't notice him puking
all over himself.

1:08:28.916 --> 1:08:30.333
You never wanted kids?

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:34.208
Ah, you'd be a great mum.

1:08:34.333 --> 1:08:36.375
I see you with the younger ones.

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:37.833
They're lucky to have you.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:49.916
Looks more like a Mr Whippy
than a pint of Guinness.

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:03.000
Watch us as we steal the show!

1:10:03.125 --> 1:10:07.291
T-Y-N-E-S-I-D-E, Tyneside!

1:10:11.166 --> 1:10:13.916
Here at home,
there's been another demonstration

1:10:14.041 --> 1:10:17.208
against Clause 28
of the Local Government Bill,

1:10:17.333 --> 1:10:19.500
the clause which seeks
to stop councils

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:21.333
from promoting homosexuality.

1:10:21.333 --> 1:10:25.000
Well over 15,000 people marched
through Manchester,

1:10:25.125 --> 1:10:27.208
clogging the streets
before staging a rally

1:10:27.333 --> 1:10:28.625
in the city centre.

1:10:28.750 --> 1:10:31.791
As ordinary men and women,

1:10:31.916 --> 1:10:36.458
we demand the same rights,

1:10:36.583 --> 1:10:38.666
no more, no less.

1:10:39.666 --> 1:10:44.500
The same rights as other ordinary,
civilised, human beings...

1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:47.333
"
by the Nightwriters)

1:12:13.208 --> 1:12:14.166
Go away.

1:12:15.333 --> 1:12:17.416
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm late for work.

1:12:17.541 --> 1:12:18.833
I can give you a lift.

1:12:20.416 --> 1:12:21.583
I'm fine walking.

1:12:22.333 --> 1:12:24.625
- Lois...
- Why can't you just leave me alone?

1:12:33.916 --> 1:12:36.083
Do you actually think
I attacked Siobhan?

1:12:37.916 --> 1:12:39.041
No.

1:12:40.291 --> 1:12:41.250
Then why?

1:12:44.708 --> 1:12:46.875
I know you want more from me,
but it's not...

1:12:49.958 --> 1:12:51.375
I can't be that person for you.

1:12:51.375 --> 1:12:53.500
I never asked you to be anything.

1:12:55.125 --> 1:12:57.750
Not about what you ask,
though, is it?

1:13:34.791 --> 1:13:36.458
I don't like women
to use bad language.

1:13:36.583 --> 1:13:38.291
Very much against that, like.

1:13:38.416 --> 1:13:40.916
If you stub your toe
or drop a teacup or something...

1:13:42.166 --> 1:13:43.083
...what do you say?

1:14:14.708 --> 1:14:16.208
-  Hi.
- Hiya.

1:14:17.750 --> 1:14:20.083
Erm... thanks for coming.

1:14:20.791 --> 1:14:22.125
Of course.

1:14:26.583 --> 1:14:28.416
Want something to drink?

1:14:28.416 --> 1:14:31.541
Erm, yeah. Yeah, in a sec, thank you. Erm...

1:14:32.583 --> 1:14:34.041
Look...

1:14:35.250 --> 1:14:37.500
I'm really sorry.

1:14:38.791 --> 1:14:40.333
- It's OK.
- No.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.041
No, it's not.

1:14:43.041 --> 1:14:44.333
I should've told you,

1:14:44.458 --> 1:14:46.458
and I should've done everything differently.

1:14:47.583 --> 1:14:48.750
Erm...

1:14:50.041 --> 1:14:51.791
Sick in the head, remember?

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.500
She reminded me a bit of you,
you know?

1:14:59.083 --> 1:15:00.583
First time we met.

1:15:01.541 --> 1:15:03.666
- Who, Lois?
- That girl, yeah.

1:15:05.291 --> 1:15:06.583
No, she's nothing like me.

1:15:07.750 --> 1:15:10.208
Debs thought so, too,
you know, like...

1:15:10.333 --> 1:15:13.125
like, erm...
a deer in the headlights.

1:15:14.375 --> 1:15:16.583
I'm not a deer in the headlights,
am I?

1:15:16.708 --> 1:15:18.250
Sometimes.

1:15:18.375 --> 1:15:20.333
You know... skittish.

1:15:20.458 --> 1:15:21.416
Skittish?

1:15:23.041 --> 1:15:24.125
Is it?

1:15:25.083 --> 1:15:26.625
Anyway...

1:15:29.375 --> 1:15:30.583
Do you want something to eat?

1:15:32.291 --> 1:15:34.708
I ate before.
OK, yeah, I might.

1:15:39.333 --> 1:15:40.916
I'm sorry I didn't return your calls.

1:15:42.708 --> 1:15:44.916
- It's fine.
- No, it isn't.

1:15:48.666 --> 1:15:50.291
Look, I've...

1:15:50.291 --> 1:15:52.708
been here before with Donna, and...

1:15:52.708 --> 1:15:55.291
Donna cheated on you
with her husband.

1:15:55.291 --> 1:15:56.833
Yeah.

1:15:56.958 --> 1:15:58.333
Yeah, but, erm...

1:15:59.541 --> 1:16:02.000
...in the end, it's the same.

1:16:02.625 --> 1:16:04.125
Because she wasn't ready.

1:16:04.833 --> 1:16:05.958
And...

1:16:07.333 --> 1:16:10.208
I...I can't do that again.

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:12.375
- I'm gonna quit my job.
- What?

1:16:12.500 --> 1:16:14.000
- Why?
- Because...

1:16:16.375 --> 1:16:17.833
You... you...

1:16:17.958 --> 1:16:19.291
I don't think
you should quit your job,

1:16:19.416 --> 1:16:21.791
because you love your job
and you're good at your job.

1:16:25.208 --> 1:16:26.250
I did something terrible.

1:16:29.916 --> 1:16:31.583
That girl, Lois from the club...

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:37.541
...I dobbed her in
to get her off my case.

1:16:39.958 --> 1:16:42.666
She's been suspended and I doubt
she's coming back after this.

1:16:47.625 --> 1:16:48.916
I...

1:16:50.041 --> 1:16:52.916
I don't think you should be
so hard on yourself.

1:16:54.625 --> 1:16:56.375
I wanna be with you, Viv.

1:16:57.291 --> 1:16:59.291
- We could go away somewhere.
- No...

1:16:59.416 --> 1:17:02.291
Look, if we forget everything
that's happened...

1:17:02.416 --> 1:17:03.833
then there will be something else.

1:17:03.833 --> 1:17:05.333
No.

1:17:05.458 --> 1:17:06.666
No, there won't.

1:17:06.791 --> 1:17:09.625
But... anyway,
I don't want to go away,

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:11.625
because I like it here.

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:14.166
Like, I'm happy. Here.

1:17:15.416 --> 1:17:19.250
This isn't what I wanted,
but I can't keep doing this.

1:17:19.250 --> 1:17:22.875
- You don't have to do this.
-  I'm sorry, but I can't.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.666
- Please, Viv...
- I'm sorry. I can't.

1:17:25.791 --> 1:17:28.250
Come on, please. Viv, please!

1:17:51.583 --> 1:17:53.833
Excuse me.
You cannot smoke in here, pet.

1:17:53.958 --> 1:17:55.458
Well, what is this here for, then?

1:18:25.666 --> 1:18:27.250
Punch!

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:31.416
Police stations don't offer crèches
for their employees.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:32.875
Why should hospitals?

1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.541
It's a ridiculous idea.

1:18:34.666 --> 1:18:37.708
No, what the nursing profession needs
is more men.

1:18:37.833 --> 1:18:40.916
If nursing were perceived
as a male and female occupation,

1:18:41.041 --> 1:18:43.541
the same as, say, teaching,
or the civil service,

1:18:43.666 --> 1:18:46.125
there'd be a stronger gut feeling
amongst the powers that be

1:18:46.250 --> 1:18:47.333
to raise nurses' salaries.

1:18:47.458 --> 1:18:49.500
- I hadn't thought about it like that.
- In the meantime,

1:18:49.500 --> 1:18:51.291
what happens
when our children get sick?

1:18:51.416 --> 1:18:53.125
And they're picketing
outside the hospitals

1:18:53.250 --> 1:18:54.666
instead of doing their damn jobs.

1:18:54.666 --> 1:18:56.000
Well, quite.

1:18:56.625 --> 1:18:58.333
What's your take on all this,
Jean?

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.083
- Well, erm...
- You must have an opinion.

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:05.541
No, come on. That's enough.

1:19:05.541 --> 1:19:08.000
Tim, why don't you go refresh
the punchbowl?

1:19:14.083 --> 1:19:16.708
God, half-term really drags,
doesn't it?

1:19:16.833 --> 1:19:18.333
Feel like I'll need a holiday
to recover.

1:19:18.458 --> 1:19:19.791
Tell me about it.

1:19:23.791 --> 1:19:25.375
Right, who wants to go play
some party games?

1:19:29.125 --> 1:19:30.166
Sammy, you coming?

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:32.041
We're gonna play party games.

1:19:32.166 --> 1:19:33.375
Go, go, go.

1:19:33.958 --> 1:19:34.916
Let's go, guys.

1:19:34.916 --> 1:19:36.500
It's been a nightmare.

1:19:36.625 --> 1:19:39.166
And it just drags on and on and on,

1:19:39.291 --> 1:19:41.375
and you know,
each time the lawyers are involved,

1:19:41.500 --> 1:19:43.875
you're paying out,
for them and the kids.

1:19:45.708 --> 1:19:47.416
Are they staying with their mum?

1:19:47.541 --> 1:19:50.000
Mostly, yeah, yeah.
I mean, like... yeah.

1:19:50.125 --> 1:19:53.083
I'm lucky if I see them once a week.
And you know, it's...

1:19:53.208 --> 1:19:56.041
I was, er, just telling Tim
about my divorce proceedings.

1:19:56.166 --> 1:19:58.833
They're bleeding me dry, I tell you. You...

1:19:58.833 --> 1:20:02.208
You women don't realise
how good you have it.

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:05.750
It's just a joke.

1:20:07.041 --> 1:20:08.208
Bad joke.

1:20:08.208 --> 1:20:09.500
No offence meant.

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:10.541
None taken.

1:20:11.083 --> 1:20:13.166
Jean went through all this
a few years back.

1:20:13.291 --> 1:20:16.375
Oh, right.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:19.083
Well, you're still in one piece,
so that bodes well.

1:20:19.208 --> 1:20:20.708
Yeah, I quite enjoyed it, actually.

1:20:24.208 --> 1:20:25.916
Er, so, what do you do, Jean?

1:20:26.666 --> 1:20:28.291
- I'm a teacher.
- Fantastic.

1:20:28.416 --> 1:20:30.041
- What do you teach?
- PE.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:32.250
Right. That must be, er...

1:20:33.583 --> 1:20:34.833
Er, which school?

1:20:34.958 --> 1:20:36.291
Tyneside.

1:20:36.416 --> 1:20:38.250
Oh. That's a commute and a half,
isn't it?

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:40.458
You didn't fancy, er...

1:20:40.583 --> 1:20:42.791
- What's Sammy's school called?
- St Christopher's.

1:20:42.916 --> 1:20:44.583
Yeah, St Christopher's.

1:20:44.583 --> 1:20:46.375
Jean actually used to teach
at St Christopher's.

1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:48.583
- Oh?
- I did for a while, yeah.

1:20:48.708 --> 1:20:50.416
What made you...?

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:52.791
I got a bit sick of running
into the kids in the local shop.

1:20:52.916 --> 1:20:55.208
Fair enough.

1:20:55.333 --> 1:20:58.375
You know, I'd never thought of that.
It must be a right pain.

1:20:58.500 --> 1:21:01.333
Although, parent-teacher evenings...

1:21:01.458 --> 1:21:04.125
probably quite a good hunting ground
for the recently divorced.

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:06.666
- Am I right, eh?

1:21:08.333 --> 1:21:09.625
Sorry.

1:21:10.833 --> 1:21:12.125
It's OK.

1:21:13.041 --> 1:21:15.583
You got a man on the scene
at the moment, then, have you, Jean?

1:21:16.291 --> 1:21:17.458
No. I haven't, no.

1:21:18.291 --> 1:21:20.375
Ah, well. Well, I'm sure...

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:21.916
I'm a lesbian.

1:21:24.333 --> 1:21:25.375
Right.

1:21:39.500 --> 1:21:41.458
I've actually got to head off.

1:21:41.583 --> 1:21:43.375
Erm...

1:21:45.041 --> 1:21:46.500
Can you give this to Sammy?

1:21:48.916 --> 1:21:51.500
Thanks for the party. I love the...

1:21:54.458 --> 1:21:55.958
Nice to meet you, Carl.

1:21:56.458 --> 1:21:57.875
Er, Craig.

1:23:54.125 --> 1:23:55.208
What are you doing?

1:23:56.041 --> 1:23:57.291
- Can you get in the car?
- What?

1:23:58.125 --> 1:23:59.791
I wanna show you something,
that's all,

1:23:59.916 --> 1:24:02.166
- and I'll drop you home after.
- I'm grounded.

1:24:03.250 --> 1:24:05.208
Don't tell me
you've been sticking to that.

1:24:05.333 --> 1:24:07.750
I don't even have to talk to you,
OK?

1:24:09.041 --> 1:24:11.041
- Can you just get in?
- OK.

1:24:42.750 --> 1:24:43.916
Where are we?

1:24:46.541 --> 1:24:47.541
Look...

1:24:51.833 --> 1:24:53.833
...I'm damaged. OK?

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:01.916
And in a way, you're not.
Well, at least, you don't have to be.

1:25:02.041 --> 1:25:03.625
If I don't have to be,
then why do you?

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:05.125
I don't know.

1:25:05.250 --> 1:25:07.000
- Maybe it's too late.
- It's not right.

1:25:07.000 --> 1:25:09.708
- Pretending.
- Look, I don't expect you to understand.

1:25:09.708 --> 1:25:11.666
You're right. I don't.

1:25:11.666 --> 1:25:13.250
Look, people failed me.

1:25:25.291 --> 1:25:27.208
And now I failed you.

1:25:34.291 --> 1:25:37.041
I'm not trying to get myself
off the hook or anything like that.

1:25:47.375 --> 1:25:48.875
But I see you carrying this...

1:25:50.958 --> 1:25:52.416
...this thing.

1:25:54.583 --> 1:25:56.125
And you don't have to.

1:25:56.250 --> 1:25:57.833
You're the one with the problem.

1:25:57.958 --> 1:25:58.916
- Not me.
- Yeah, I know.

1:25:59.041 --> 1:26:01.416
- I don't know why you think that...
- Yeah, I know.

1:26:02.375 --> 1:26:04.041
Yeah, I know.
I know what I did was wrong.

1:26:12.958 --> 1:26:14.916
You know...

1:26:15.041 --> 1:26:17.083
it was Siobhan that kissed me.

1:26:21.708 --> 1:26:23.166
Not that it matters now.

1:26:44.958 --> 1:26:46.208
Shall we go?

1:27:07.500 --> 1:27:09.958
- Hey, you came!
- Hiya.

1:27:10.750 --> 1:27:13.083
- And who's this one?
- I'm Lois.

1:27:13.083 --> 1:27:15.041
Hiya, Lois. Welcome.

1:27:15.041 --> 1:27:16.625
You a friend of Jean's then?

1:27:19.333 --> 1:27:20.916
Speech!

1:27:22.375 --> 1:27:26.291
I just wanted to say
that as some of you already know,

1:27:26.416 --> 1:27:28.250
money's been
a little scarce this year,

1:27:28.375 --> 1:27:31.291
but thanks to the heroic efforts
of the Bog Fund...

1:27:33.250 --> 1:27:35.583
...we were able to throw
a little something together.

1:27:36.375 --> 1:27:38.708
So, Debs...

1:27:38.833 --> 1:27:40.041
my love...

1:27:41.125 --> 1:27:44.208
...these are for you. From all of us.

1:27:44.333 --> 1:27:47.083
Well, technically not from us,
but they are for you.

1:27:47.208 --> 1:27:49.666
Love you, babes. Happy birthday!

1:27:49.791 --> 1:27:52.250
- To the Bog Fund!
-  The Bog Fund!

1:27:54.833 --> 1:27:56.625
Now let's get fucked up!

1:28:01.333 --> 1:28:03.583
Hi, lady.

1:28:03.708 --> 1:28:05.708
- We missed you.
-  You all right?

1:28:07.333 --> 1:28:08.333
What's the Bog Fund?

1:28:09.750 --> 1:28:12.250
Right, so, say you get kicked out
by your parents,

1:28:12.250 --> 1:28:14.583
or you can't pay your rent
or summat,

1:28:14.583 --> 1:28:16.250
or you need a new pair of shoes,

1:28:16.375 --> 1:28:18.541
then you can ask for money
from the Bog Fund.

1:28:19.416 --> 1:28:22.166
Wait, so, anyone can ask for money?

1:28:22.291 --> 1:28:25.083
Yeah, well, any poor lesbians
from the North East.

1:28:25.208 --> 1:28:27.666
Babes, you don't have a drink.
Let's get you a drink.

1:28:29.333 --> 1:28:30.625
I'll keep an eye on her.

1:28:32.416 --> 1:28:35.000
- Where's the money come from?
- People like her.

1:28:35.958 --> 1:28:37.708
Lesbians with proper jobs.

1:28:37.833 --> 1:28:39.833
Teachers, lawyers, whatever.

1:28:39.958 --> 1:28:43.750
They can put money in to, you know,
help out those who are more hard up.

1:28:46.833 --> 1:28:49.041
How old are you, anyway?
You old enough for a drink?

1:28:50.250 --> 1:28:52.583
Yeah, all right.
