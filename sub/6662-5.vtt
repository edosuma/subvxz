00:05.296 --> 00:06.631
My name is Bridget.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.216
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.258 --> 00:11.177
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.013
We'll protect you.
<b></b>
You don't get it.

00:13.054 --> 00:16.182
Bodaway wants me dead,
I'm dead.

00:16.224 --> 00:19.519
I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.438
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:21.479 --> 00:24.649
Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.734
It was so easy.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.736
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.612
They all think that I'm her.

00:29.654 --> 00:31.156
Her husband.

00:31.197 --> 00:32.782
Her stepdaughter.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.075
You're high.

00:34.117 --> 00:35.076
Was high.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.077
Her lover.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.704
That baby is ours.

00:37.746 --> 00:38.913
Her best friend.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.707
I have a few questions.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.958
About Siobhan Martin?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.251
No, about Bridget Kelly.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.336
The only person I could trust.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.838
Let me help you.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.007
That's for sleeping with
my husband, you whore!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.717
I'm not who you think I am!

00:50.759 --> 00:51.968
I'm not Siobhan.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.053
I'm Bridget.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.638
MAN:
Siobhan, we have a problem.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.723
Bridget's still alive.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.896
MAN: ♪ Now that we are gathered
here today ♪

01:05.065 --> 01:07.317
♪ Let's have a drink... ♪

01:07.358 --> 01:08.818
GEMMA:
You've reached Gemma.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.737
Don't be boring.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.363
It's Siobhan.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.324
Please call me back.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.366
No luck?

01:17.744 --> 01:20.830
And you really have no idea
why Gemma left the Hamptons?

01:20.872 --> 01:22.165
I already told you--

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
no.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.795
What exactly did you say to her?

01:26.836 --> 01:27.295
Nothing.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.343
I've been looking
all over for you.

01:33.384 --> 01:34.427
That's for sleeping

01:34.469 --> 01:36.387
with my husband,
you whore!

01:36.429 --> 01:38.431
I swear to you, I'm not Siobhan.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.599
I'm Bridget.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.642
What?

01:40.683 --> 01:42.268
Gemma, it's the truth, OK?

01:42.310 --> 01:43.853
I know it's a lot
to take in.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.814
That's your excuse for
sleeping with my husband?

01:45.855 --> 01:47.023
That you're her twin?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.024
You're insane.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.067
Stay away from me.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.568
Gemma, you don't understand.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.903
My life was in danger.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.030
It was the only choice
that I had.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.323
Please, you can't
tell anyone.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.574
Save it, Siobhan.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.118
You know, I married
a first-class liar,

01:58.159 --> 01:59.953
but you are the
gold standard.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.038
It's pathetic, really.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.039
BRIDGET:
Wait, please!

02:13.091 --> 02:14.884
Don't worry.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.053
I'm sure Gemma will turn up.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.055
(rap music playing loudly)

02:40.994 --> 02:44.581
(rap music playing loudly)

02:44.622 --> 02:45.582
Oh, my God.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.170
Hello?

02:50.211 --> 02:51.212
Andrew, wait.

03:01.222 --> 03:02.223
Got to go.

03:03.975 --> 03:06.477
Excuse me.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.896
Who are you?

03:07.937 --> 03:10.690
Um, Erica.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.774
Where is my daughter?

03:17.822 --> 03:18.990
Juliet!

03:24.037 --> 03:25.455
What the hell happened?

03:27.457 --> 03:30.126
Wow. Way too bright in here.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.044
Why aren't you at your mother's?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.091
What's your problem, Siobhan?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.384
You always have so much to say.

03:43.348 --> 03:44.599
ANDREW:
Juliet, we're not done here.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.895
Your mother didn't tell me
you were coming back early.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.355
Mom doesn't tell you
a lot of things.

03:50.396 --> 03:51.606
(music stops)
<b></b>
Don't be cute with me!

03:51.648 --> 03:53.316
You and your friends
trashed this place!

03:53.358 --> 03:54.359
I'm allowed to have
friends over.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.485
It's not a biggie.

03:55.526 --> 03:57.946
You destroyed
Siobhan's photo.

03:57.987 --> 04:00.782
I think it's an improvement.

04:00.823 --> 04:01.991
I don't understand.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.701
I thought you two
were getting along.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.828
Dad, she held my hair back
while I was puking.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.372
We're hardly besties.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.539
Well, she doesn't deserve this.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.166
You're going to apologize.

04:10.208 --> 04:13.670
I will never apologize
to that woman.

04:13.711 --> 04:16.506
Look. You better find
some respect for this family.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.383
Look, I know you and Siobhan
have had your differences,

04:18.424 --> 04:19.926
but to act out like this...

04:19.968 --> 04:21.636
You don't know
the half of it.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.681
Well, clearly we all need
to go back to therapy.

04:24.722 --> 04:26.641
Of course we do.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.850
Yeah, that's your answer
for everything.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.689
GEMMA:
You've reached Gemma.

04:32.730 --> 04:34.315
Don't be boring.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.776
Gemma, it's me.

04:36.818 --> 04:37.777
If you're getting
these messages,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.113
will you please call me back.

04:40.154 --> 04:40.613
We need to talk.

04:43.157 --> 04:45.118
(indistinct chattering
over computer)

04:49.914 --> 04:51.457
Happy New Year!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.345
(door opens, closes)

05:10.059 --> 05:11.019
Seriously?

05:11.060 --> 05:13.229
You're here?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.606
Why'd you ditch me?

05:15.648 --> 05:17.191
Everybody's worried
about you.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.193
I doubt that.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.695
All right, what is going on?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.447
I thought we called a truce,
yesterday on the beach,

05:22.488 --> 05:24.490
and then you stormed off
at dinner last night,

05:24.532 --> 05:25.700
and when Siobhan
went to talk to you,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.744
you, like,
you totally freaked out.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.374
Did, uh, Siobhan...

05:33.416 --> 05:34.709
did she say something to you?

05:34.751 --> 05:35.752
Are you guys having a fight?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.841
You can be honest with me.

05:41.883 --> 05:44.218
You want me
to be honest with you?

05:44.260 --> 05:45.720
Yeah.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.763
I do.

05:56.314 --> 05:57.273
What are you looking at?

06:01.277 --> 06:02.236
Gemma.

06:03.279 --> 06:04.572
Gemma!

06:04.614 --> 06:06.616
Just give me
some space, please.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.688
Hey, I tried Gemma's office,
but there was no answer.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.815
I'm gonna go over there.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.735
You OK?

06:42.777 --> 06:44.946
Juliet stormed off again.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.823
And I'm doing damage
control from last night.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.411
Anything I can do to help?

06:51.452 --> 06:53.121
She'll come back.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.122
Eventually.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.376
You know, I
saw you two.

07:01.587 --> 07:04.215
The night she got sick.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.176
Before she went to Miami.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.636
You did?

07:08.678 --> 07:10.096
I heard the noise
and came out to help,

07:10.138 --> 07:13.891
but turns out,
she didn't need me.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.059
You had your arms
around her,

07:15.101 --> 07:17.395
and I was really touched.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.275
But then something happened.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.651
I just don't know
what her problem is.

07:27.905 --> 07:28.906
I think I do.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.290
What are you doing?

07:37.331 --> 07:38.541
I'm looking for drugs.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.001
I confiscated
those weeks ago.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.628
And you don't think
she got her hands on more?

07:42.670 --> 07:43.880
Andrew, did you see her?

07:43.921 --> 07:45.089
Her eyes were
completely bloodshot

07:45.131 --> 07:47.508
and her pupils were dilated.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.887
I'm guessing oxycodone
or uppers.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.432
I know it's hard to admit,
but your daughter is using.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.933
That's why
she's acting this way.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.727
Look, I don't want
to argue, Shiv.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.520
But I've
always respected
Juliet's privacy.

07:59.562 --> 08:00.771
I think this should
be a conversation,

08:00.813 --> 08:01.814
not a ransack.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.903
And you think she's gonna be
honest with you, just open up?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.654
Andrew, you can't count
on her to be the adult.

08:08.696 --> 08:09.697
You have to be.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.075
You're upset with me.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.580
Just, uh, surprised.

08:17.622 --> 08:18.623
Why do you
even care?

08:20.917 --> 08:23.169
I, um, I guess I never told you,

08:23.211 --> 08:25.713
I had a cousin
that went through this.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.466
It didn't end well.

08:28.508 --> 08:31.677
Look, I'm not naive.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.429
I just don't want
to think of her that way.

08:33.471 --> 08:34.972
She's my little girl.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.307
I know.

08:36.349 --> 08:36.849
That's why we're
going to help her.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.605
Not to mention we have
a baby on the way.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.483
If Juliet's living
under this roof, then...

08:45.525 --> 08:46.776
Drugs are out of the question.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.362
I get it.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.073
But just...just let me
handle this, will you?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.377
Let me see your arm.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.419
Gemma.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.217
You don't h-have a scar.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.680
So everything you said was true?

09:18.391 --> 09:21.394
Siobhan burned herself
in a cooking class.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.062
She had a scar that you don't.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.732
Can we go somewhere
and talk?

09:30.278 --> 09:32.363
MAN: You must really love
Bridget Kelly.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.156
Dosed you with a lot of junk
the last couple days,

09:34.198 --> 09:35.658
but you still won't talk.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.410
So we're gonna
change things up.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.411
Please stop.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.747
Congrats,
you're an addict again.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.381
JULIET:
It's 31 ounces.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.382
And it rocks.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.149
I don't believe this.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.442
I know it was her idea.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.485
Daddy would never
go through my stuff.

10:11.527 --> 10:15.740
She just manipulates him,
makes him not trust me.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.034
We were so close
before Siobhan came along.

10:18.075 --> 10:20.494
She just...
she messed it all up.

10:23.414 --> 10:27.376
She'll freak and tell me
I'm being vindictive.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.547
(laughs)

10:31.589 --> 10:32.965
But I learned from the best.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.887
(laughs)

10:40.181 --> 10:41.140
Tomorrow night?

10:43.517 --> 10:44.560
Will it be a real party, though?

10:47.021 --> 10:48.648
(laughs)

10:48.689 --> 10:51.025
Not Jersey boys with Saint Marks
haircuts, though, right?

11:00.534 --> 11:02.620
Holy crap.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.621
I got to go.

11:10.711 --> 11:14.090
I can't believe Siobhan
killed herself.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.925
I mean, she was
my best friend.

11:15.966 --> 11:18.594
I didn't know she was
in so much pain.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.263
There was a lot of things
I didn't know.

11:21.305 --> 11:22.682
There was a lot of things that I
didn't know

11:22.723 --> 11:24.475
about Siobhan, either.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.395
She was like
a sister to me.

11:27.436 --> 11:29.689
Which makes the betrayal
even worse.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.983
I'm so sorry, I can't even
imagine how you must feel.

11:33.025 --> 11:36.070
Yeah, I don't know
what to feel anymore.

11:36.112 --> 11:42.118
My best friend slept with my
husband and got pregnant.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.703
Do you think it was Henry's,
for sure?

11:43.744 --> 11:44.829
I don't know.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.792
How long?

11:49.834 --> 11:51.127
How long what?

11:51.168 --> 11:54.630
How long have you been
pretending to be her?

11:54.672 --> 11:57.299
Two weeks.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.843
I don't get it.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.553
It's complicated.
<b></b>
No, I mean,
I don't get

12:00.594 --> 12:03.723
what kind of a person does this
to their own sister.

12:03.764 --> 12:06.726
A desperate one.
Gemma, I didn't want to do this.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.477
I didn't have a choice.

12:08.519 --> 12:11.230
The man that I'm supposed to
testify against wants me dead.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.276
You can't tell anyone.

12:15.317 --> 12:18.487
I guess you are
Siobhan's sister.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.698
You've somehow made this all
about you.

12:24.577 --> 12:29.540
For the record, I don't have
to do anything you ask me.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.708
I don't even know you.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.044
(whistles loudly)

12:45.222 --> 12:46.932
I'm just so overwhelmed.

12:46.974 --> 12:53.189
The only thing that kept me
from using was...coming here.

12:53.230 --> 12:58.402
I recently opened up to someone
about...who I really am.

12:58.444 --> 13:03.199
I...keep trying to make
up for my mistakes.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.702
One of the steps is to make
amends with those we've harmed.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.912
It's important
that you follow that.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.834
It's just...now that
I've told the truth,

13:13.876 --> 13:17.588
I'm not sure I can live
with the consequences.

13:17.630 --> 13:23.511
I thought lying was bad,
but compared to the truth...

13:23.552 --> 13:25.012
I thought the truth was
supposed to set you free.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.101
Yeah, well, clichés are crap.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.646
And secrets only
make addictions worse.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.899
Every addict knows--
you come clean,

13:36.941 --> 13:37.900
you stay clean.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.324
Worst
after-party ever.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.659
I'm sorry?

13:46.700 --> 13:49.537
Oh, it's my NA joke.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.289
Clearly not a very good one.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.833
I didn't introduce myself.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.627
Name's Charlie,
I'm sober four years.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.547
I just switched to this
meeting from Flushing.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.841
The coffee in Queens is
so much better, FYI.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.512
And you are?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.430
I thought this was supposed
to be anonymous.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.473
It is.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.645
I should be going.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.980
CHARLIE:
I've been in your
shoes, you know.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.276
(continues indistinctly)

14:23.320 --> 14:27.700
Look, if you ever want
to talk, give me a call.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.786
Thank you, Charlie.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.250
Nice meeting you,
Ms. Anonymous.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.779
(music playing,
indistinct conversations)

15:32.389 --> 15:35.059
WOMAN:
You lost?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.144
Lookin' for somethin'?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.145
The exit.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.819
MAN:
Morning, sunshine.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.655
Have a nice trip?

15:47.696 --> 15:49.657
(chuckles)

15:55.621 --> 15:58.165
Juliet, don't you have something
to say to Siobhan?

16:00.626 --> 16:03.087
Sorry for ruining
your wedding dress.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.755
And?

16:04.797 --> 16:05.923
I'll pay for it to be fixed.

16:08.884 --> 16:11.929
Thank you. But it's not the
dress that I'm worried about.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.473
It's you.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.557
Highly doubt that.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.813
Juliet and I have had
a little talk.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.983
Haven't we? And things are going
to be different in this house.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.194
Aren't they?

16:32.032 --> 16:35.494
So what'd you do today, Siobhan?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.454
I, uh...I ran some errands.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.791
Really? What
kind of errands?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.626
Why do you ask?

16:42.668 --> 16:45.754
'Cause I thought I saw
you at Union Station.

16:45.796 --> 16:46.880
Were you on the train?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.802
I was.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.595
You took the subway?

16:53.637 --> 16:56.390
You don't take the train
anywhere.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.226
I've realized it's faster
during rush hour.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.978
No, it was in the
middle of the day,

17:01.020 --> 17:04.273
and there's not much traffic
going into Brooklyn.

17:04.314 --> 17:05.274
Isn't that where you were?

17:07.609 --> 17:08.694
I'm sorry, am I,

17:08.736 --> 17:10.446
um...missing out
on something here?

17:10.487 --> 17:12.281
I figured out what your little
secret is, Siobhan.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.120
She was at Narcotics Anonymous.

17:18.162 --> 17:20.456
You followed me?
Yeah, I did.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.874
I can explain...
<b></b>
Don't bother.

17:21.915 --> 17:22.875
Daddy...

17:26.712 --> 17:27.671
I'm not going to rehab.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.006
Rehab?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.633
You're not putting me
into some program.

17:31.675 --> 17:33.761
I saw those people
you were with.

17:33.802 --> 17:36.889
I'm not some low-life
degenerate addict-loser.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.313
Is this true?

17:44.354 --> 17:47.024
I wanted to do some
research on addiction.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.567
Didn't I ask you to
let me handle this?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.194
Yeah...

17:50.235 --> 17:54.323
I just don't want matters to get
out of hand, please.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.241
Trust me.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.451
I've got a plan.

17:57.493 --> 17:58.452
(elevator bell dings)

18:04.666 --> 18:06.168
Hmm.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.003
ANDREW:
Gemma?

18:08.045 --> 18:10.589
Hi...

18:10.631 --> 18:13.133
Ah! Hey, come and sit with us.
I'll fix you some dinner.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.761
No, thank you.
I need to talk to you.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.970
Actually, I was wondering

18:17.012 --> 18:18.263
if I could maybe
speak to Gemma alone?

18:20.974 --> 18:23.852
Well, why don't I give
you ladies some privacy?

18:23.894 --> 18:25.896
Actually, I need
to talk to both of you.

18:25.938 --> 18:28.315
What I have to say
is a game changer.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.441
Gemma, don't.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.361
Siobhan, please.

18:32.402 --> 18:34.113
I know how close
the four of us are,

18:34.154 --> 18:39.910
and you may not like
what I'm about to say.

18:39.952 --> 18:43.163
I...can't continue to work

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
on the loft.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.375
What?

18:46.416 --> 18:48.168
I'm overwhelmed.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.046
Between what's going on with
Henry and the contractor fiasco,

18:51.088 --> 18:54.007
I just...my head's not in it
and I think I need to step away.

18:54.049 --> 18:55.801
Well, that's very
disappointing.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.678
But we completely understand.

18:57.719 --> 18:59.763
Of course.
<b></b>
And I'm not going
to leave you hanging.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.057
I've got a great list
of replacements.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.642
Do you promise
that you don't hate me?

19:03.684 --> 19:06.520
Oh, that would
be impossible.
Wouldn't it, Shiv?

19:06.562 --> 19:09.231
Yes.

19:09.273 --> 19:10.315
Look, um...

19:10.357 --> 19:11.483
if you'll excuse me.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.031
Thank you.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.576
Yeah, don't thank me yet.

19:20.617 --> 19:23.787
I have a favor to ask you.

19:23.829 --> 19:29.293
These last 24 hours
have been torture.

19:29.334 --> 19:32.171
Knowing Henry's
cheating on me.

19:32.212 --> 19:35.132
Pretending like
nothing's happened.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.967
I can't even imagine.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.678
He was the love of my life.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.891
I gave him my whole heart,
and he just crushed it.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.350
What can I do to help?

19:45.392 --> 19:46.894
I've given this
a lot of thought,

19:46.935 --> 19:52.774
and recognize how
unique this situation is.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.444
I want to divorce Henry.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.655
But he does not deserve
a dime of my money.

19:58.697 --> 20:02.367
Or custody of our children.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.621
We have an infidelity clause
in our prenup.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.372
OK.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.083
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna tell
Henry I have a work emergency.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.627
I'll be gone all night.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.921
He'll be alone
at the apartment.

20:13.962 --> 20:17.633
I need irrefutable evidence
that he's cheating on me.

20:17.674 --> 20:22.346
And if I catch him in the act,
he can't deny it.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.807
What exactly are you getting at?

20:25.849 --> 20:27.643
I want you to sleep
with my husband...

20:29.895 --> 20:31.813
...or I'll tell everyone
who you really are.

21:05.597 --> 21:06.556
(sighs)

21:11.186 --> 21:12.604
(phone line ringing)

21:12.646 --> 21:14.731
(phone vibrates)

21:24.283 --> 21:26.201
RECORDING: You've reached
Professor Malcolm Ward.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.078
Please leave
a message at the tone.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.913
Malcolm, where are you?

21:29.955 --> 21:33.000
Why aren't you answering
my calls?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.668
I'm suffocating.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.837
I can't do this.
I need your help.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.879
Will you please call me?

21:44.469 --> 21:45.429
(whispers):
What am I doing?

22:00.652 --> 22:02.696
9:00 a.m.,
I almost took a handful.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.573
Well,
you felt powerless,

22:04.614 --> 22:06.533
and then you took
personal inventory.

22:06.575 --> 22:10.746
That's one of the steps.
That takes strength.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.955
I hate how this feels.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.126
Could you tell me a little bit
more about your problem?

22:19.379 --> 22:20.422
Yeah, I remember

22:20.464 --> 22:22.507
when I first
started the program,

22:22.549 --> 22:24.217
I had a hard time
showing my cards, too.

22:29.097 --> 22:34.603
Either I do something that I
know is wrong to save my family

22:34.644 --> 22:38.815
or I risk losing it all.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.609
It's a no-win.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.569
It's a heavy choice.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.321
I know if I go through with it,

22:44.363 --> 22:46.281
I won't be able
to live with myself.

22:46.323 --> 22:47.657
And you're afraid
you're gonna relapse.

22:50.494 --> 22:55.332
It's hard to give advice
if I don't have all the details.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.126
But at the end of the day,
you just got to stay clean.

22:58.168 --> 23:00.754
And the only way you can do
that is if you take the road

23:00.796 --> 23:02.964
that's gonna preserve
your dignity.

23:03.006 --> 23:06.760
We addicts, we feed on shame.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.804
And this addiction, man,
it's tricky.

23:08.845 --> 23:10.430
Inevitably, you
have to remember

23:10.472 --> 23:12.516
it's only gonna lead to jail,

23:12.557 --> 23:15.644
being institutionalized,
or death.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.062
Hey, look at me;
I'm two for three.

23:20.399 --> 23:21.775
That help?

23:21.817 --> 23:25.112
Yeah, it does.

23:25.153 --> 23:28.407
I'm not gonna lie,
you've got a bumpy road ahead.

23:28.448 --> 23:32.786
But if you're interested,
I'll be your sponsor.

23:32.828 --> 23:33.912
Thank you.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.497
I really do
appreciate the offer,

23:35.539 --> 23:38.041
but I already have one.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.126
Ah, yeah, OK.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.585
Really?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.379
Where was your sponsor
when you almost broke today?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.470
I didn't think it would feel
this bad, but it does.

23:50.512 --> 23:53.765
I mean, I'm just trying
to figure out what went wrong.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.017
Yeah, OK.

23:56.059 --> 23:59.855
Will you call me later if you
can think of another approach?

23:59.896 --> 24:02.065
Yeah. Bye.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.191
Everything all right?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.860
No.

24:04.901 --> 24:07.446
Just seems like the bottom
keeps falling out lately.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.578
Well, maybe you need to make
more of an effort.

24:14.619 --> 24:15.996
A real one.

24:16.037 --> 24:17.956
I don't know,
I thought that I was.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.292
But maybe you're right.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.502
It's just so...hard.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.176
This is how I define myself,
and the thought of losing it

24:29.217 --> 24:32.762
makes me question who I am.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.931
Maybe you don't
have to lose it.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.683
No, th-they were pretty clear.

24:36.725 --> 24:40.228
Publishers are dropping me.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.438
Use my manuscript for firewood.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.446
This is about
your book?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.072
What did you think
I was talking about?

24:51.114 --> 24:53.867
You define yourself
by your book?

24:53.909 --> 24:56.495
Not by being a
husband or a father?

24:56.536 --> 24:57.704
Hey, that's not what I meant.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.289
Oh, my God, Henry,
this is the problem.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.458
This has always
been the problem.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.043
God, I'm an idiot!

25:03.084 --> 25:04.419
I'm going to the
loft to pack up.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.549
(tools whirring)

25:21.394 --> 25:23.188
It's not gonna happen.

25:23.230 --> 25:25.065
I'm not going through
with your proposal.

25:25.106 --> 25:26.733
You don't have a choice.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.652
Gemma, I'm here
to reason with you.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.986
I've already
fallen into a hole

25:30.028 --> 25:32.197
I can barely
crawl out of.

25:32.239 --> 25:33.532
I won't do it again.

25:33.573 --> 25:35.283
I had a feeling
you might say that.

25:35.325 --> 25:37.202
Have you considered
the fallout

25:37.244 --> 25:38.828
when the cat's
let out of the bag?

25:38.870 --> 25:40.205
Please keep your voice down.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.873
How is Andrew gonna feel
when he realizes

25:41.915 --> 25:44.960
that his real wife is dead
and he's been sharing a bed

25:45.001 --> 25:50.257
with a drug addict,
stripper, whore?

25:50.298 --> 25:51.383
Where did you hear that?

25:51.424 --> 25:53.051
Oh, I did my research, Bridget.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.351
You know who else would love
to know your secret?

26:01.393 --> 26:03.144
That FBI guy.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.272
It's a good thing
I kept his number.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.732
I wonder how he'll feel when
he finds out that the fugitive

26:07.774 --> 26:11.027
he's been chasing has been
under his nose all along.

26:11.069 --> 26:12.487
I mean, did you really
think this through?

26:12.529 --> 26:14.155
It's ridiculous.

26:14.197 --> 26:16.950
Aren't you supposed to be
pregnant, for crying out loud?

26:16.992 --> 26:20.328
You had no right to do this
to the people in Siobhan's life.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.913
I'm trying to help them.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.415
My sister left behind
a huge mess.

26:23.456 --> 26:24.624
I'm trying to clean it up.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.084
This has nothing
to do with them.

26:26.126 --> 26:29.170
Everything you've done
has been self-serving.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.171
That's not true.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.464
Prove it.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.800
The rendezvous with Henry
happens tonight.

26:33.842 --> 26:37.554
Do you have any idea how many
lives you would be destroying?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.681
It's not just me
you're punishing.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.433
What about your boys?

26:41.474 --> 26:44.519
Andrew, Juliet.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.689
I'm not planning on
being my sister forever.

26:47.731 --> 26:50.650
Just long enough to fix things.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.068
Just give me a chance, and I...

26:52.110 --> 26:55.488
By midnight,
or I'll tell Andrew everything.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.489
Your call.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.578
I won't do it.
<b></b>
Yes, you will.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.204
We both know
you don't have a choice.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.833
JULIET: So can we get
this lunch thing over with?

27:06.875 --> 27:09.711
We're not going to lunch.
Sit down.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.005
If this is about rehab,
I already told you, I'm not...

27:12.047 --> 27:13.131
You start tomorrow.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.094
Public school?

27:18.136 --> 27:19.262
Well...

27:19.304 --> 27:21.014
But all my friends
go to Wessex Prep.

27:21.056 --> 27:23.016
The semester's already started
at private schools, Juliet.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.643
There's no other option.
<b></b>
You can give them

27:24.684 --> 27:26.394
a donation,
and they'll let me in.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.063
I'm not paying anyone off.

27:28.104 --> 27:29.439
Why am I being punished?!

27:29.481 --> 27:31.858
You're not being punished.

27:31.900 --> 27:33.443
This is a fresh start,

27:33.485 --> 27:35.445
and it's something
you're in desperate need of.

27:35.487 --> 27:37.030
I'm not sending you
to rehab,

27:37.072 --> 27:39.157
but you will stay clean.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.076
So you're sending me
to public school.

27:41.117 --> 27:42.952
Your friends are
a terrible influence.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.579
I'm sick and tired
of you hanging out

27:44.621 --> 27:46.498
with kids who've been
in and out of rehab three times

27:46.539 --> 27:47.791
before their 16th birthday.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.169
(sighs softly)

27:53.672 --> 27:57.050
Juliet, I can't believe
this is about drugs.

28:00.261 --> 28:02.555
You're so much better than this.

28:02.597 --> 28:05.016
Dad, it's not about drugs.

28:07.394 --> 28:09.479
It's about Siobhan.

28:09.521 --> 28:11.439
Stop blaming Siobhan.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.942
She has nothing to do with this,
other than trying to help.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.819
She's not helping.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.196
She's rummaging
through my stuff,

28:18.238 --> 28:19.656
going to
druggie meetings,

28:19.698 --> 28:21.991
narc-ing me out.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.911
It's like she's a whole
new kind of bitch.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.664
Watch your mouth.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.791
Siobhan cares about you.

28:29.833 --> 28:33.128
You trashed her closet
yet she didn't bat an eyelid.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.131
All she's concerned about
is your well-being.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.799
You and I both know
the only person

28:37.841 --> 28:41.886
Siobhan cares about
is herself.

28:41.928 --> 28:43.888
Well, I don't believe that.

28:43.930 --> 28:44.597
You really want to know
why I hate Siobhan?

28:47.267 --> 28:50.645
Because she's a cheating bitch
who sleeps with married men.

29:00.572 --> 29:02.532
(rock music playing)

29:15.295 --> 29:17.380
It's not like you to call me
six times, Siobhan.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.466
Where's the fire?

29:19.507 --> 29:20.759
We need to talk.

29:20.800 --> 29:22.010
(chuckles)

29:22.051 --> 29:24.345
Can I get a scotch
with a water back?

29:24.387 --> 29:25.346
BARTENDER:
You got it.

29:25.388 --> 29:27.432
You look fantastic.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.225
Remember when we'd just
sit here for hours

29:29.267 --> 29:32.437
talking about how wrong it was
that we were together?

29:32.479 --> 29:35.648
You called us Rick and Ilsa.

29:35.690 --> 29:39.736
"Just because you despise me,
you're the only one I trust."

29:43.823 --> 29:44.866
You got somewhere
you got to be?

29:48.953 --> 29:50.830
Mmm.

29:50.872 --> 29:52.791
I forgot
how you sparkle up close.

29:58.004 --> 29:59.714
Your wife knows about us.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.469
She overheard us
in the Hamptons.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.513
She knows about the affair,
the baby.

30:06.554 --> 30:08.348
That's why she left.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.850
She wants me to get you in
bed, so she can catch us.

30:10.892 --> 30:13.603
Have irrefutable proof
so you lose everything--

30:13.645 --> 30:14.604
your money,

30:14.646 --> 30:15.730
your home, your kids.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.731
She wouldn't.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.025
Oh, she would
and she will.

30:19.067 --> 30:22.028
She wants me to lose everything,
too--my family.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.947
We can't let her do that.

30:23.988 --> 30:25.490
Henry, you need
to fix this.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.575
You need to keep her quiet.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.702
How the hell am I
supposed to do that, Siobhan?

30:29.744 --> 30:31.371
Go home.

30:31.412 --> 30:32.664
Make things right.

30:32.705 --> 30:35.124
Tell her you love her.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.835
I can't do that.

30:36.876 --> 30:40.421
I don't love her, I love you.

30:40.463 --> 30:41.881
You can learn to love her again.

30:41.923 --> 30:43.216
Just try.

30:43.258 --> 30:44.259
For your kids.

30:46.302 --> 30:49.055
I'm sorry.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.724
You may be able to live a lie
like that, but I can't.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.646
I'm not gonna do it anymore.

30:56.688 --> 30:57.647
I'm done.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.817
Then I'm out of moves.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.293
MAN: Taxi!

31:37.061 --> 31:38.062
She told me.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.404
I really hoped Juliet
would never find out.

31:48.698 --> 31:49.657
Juliet?

31:49.699 --> 31:52.035
W-What are you talking about?

31:52.076 --> 31:54.787
When Juliet was
down in Miami,

31:54.829 --> 31:57.457
her mother told her
I cheated with you.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.961
That marriage was long over
before we even met.

32:02.003 --> 32:06.507
But what we did scarred Juliet.

32:06.549 --> 32:08.593
I'm worried about her, Shiv.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.594
(sighs)

32:09.636 --> 32:11.387
Where is she?

32:11.429 --> 32:13.640
She snuck out.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.099
I called her friend Erica's,

32:15.141 --> 32:17.310
spoke to her parents,
but they're not there.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.478
Now she's not answering
her cell.

32:18.519 --> 32:19.479
Should I call the police?

32:25.526 --> 32:28.237
(sighs)

32:28.279 --> 32:29.572
Try here first.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.865
You go.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.076
I'll wait here
in case she comes back.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.955
Great, I'll call you
when I find her.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.122
(sighs)

32:43.711 --> 32:44.671
Had to tie him up again.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.880
He was beginning
to sober up.

32:47.340 --> 32:48.758
Call Bridget back now.

32:51.177 --> 32:53.179
Only if you dose me first.

32:53.221 --> 32:54.180
Knew you'd like it.

32:56.432 --> 32:58.393
(undoing restraints)

33:01.646 --> 33:02.772
(screams)

33:07.944 --> 33:09.862
So that's it,
we're killing him?

33:11.280 --> 33:12.699
He should be so lucky.

33:14.450 --> 33:15.702
(elevator bell dings)

33:15.743 --> 33:16.744
Andrew?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.206
Andrew?

33:24.669 --> 33:26.337
He's not here.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.131
It's past midnight.

33:28.172 --> 33:31.009
I stood outside our apartment
waiting for you to show up.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.219
Henry wandered in,
but you didn't.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.887
You realize
your time's up.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.389
I gave you a
chance to help me.

33:36.431 --> 33:39.183
Now there's nothing you
can do to help yourself.

33:39.225 --> 33:42.520
Everyone's going to know
who you really are, Bridget.

33:42.562 --> 33:45.314
Do you have any idea how many
twisted things I've learned

33:45.356 --> 33:47.358
about my sister's life
in the last few weeks?

33:47.400 --> 33:49.027
Well, she kind of sucks.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.238
Yeah, and her stepdaughter's
future is in your hands.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.198
This has nothing
to do with Juliet.
<b></b>
She is

33:54.240 --> 33:56.868
in a really fragile place,
Gemma.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.037
If any of this gets out,
I'm afraid...
<b></b>
Don't use

33:59.078 --> 34:01.456
her stepdaughter
as your bargaining chip.

34:01.497 --> 34:02.832
I mean, you're embarrassing
yourself.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.586
I know how angry you are,

34:06.627 --> 34:08.588
but I'm the one
who called it off.

34:08.629 --> 34:10.673
I'm the one who told
Henry it was over.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.842
I don't want anything
to do with your husband.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.762
You have to know that.

34:15.803 --> 34:18.639
I know how alone
you must feel.

34:18.681 --> 34:19.932
I know what it's like
to feel

34:19.974 --> 34:21.184
like there's no one
you can count on.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.314
Siobhan failed you as a friend

34:26.355 --> 34:30.818
but...give me a chance.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.570
Maybe I can be the friend
that she wasn't.

34:37.700 --> 34:39.035
What the hell am I doing?

34:41.913 --> 34:43.790
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.294
(car horn honks)

34:48.336 --> 34:50.630
(phone rings)

34:50.671 --> 34:51.672
Hello?

34:51.714 --> 34:53.007
HENRY:
You have got some nerve.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.634
Excuse me?

34:54.675 --> 34:57.470
I know what your plan is,
and I am one step ahead of you.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.513
What are you talking about?

34:58.554 --> 34:59.889
You are trying to set me up,

34:59.931 --> 35:01.974
planning to take my boys
away from me.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.101
Who told you that?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.560
Siobhan--we met
for drinks tonight

35:04.602 --> 35:05.561
and she told me everything.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.980
You are sick, do you know that?

35:08.022 --> 35:10.233
You saw Siobhan tonight?

35:10.274 --> 35:13.820
No, no, you are not going
to get away with this, Gemma.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.114
I am not losing my kids.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.532
I, I'm not having
this conversation.

35:17.573 --> 35:19.158
I'm picking up my car
at the office

35:19.200 --> 35:21.244
and then I'll be home.
<b></b>
You know what, you know what?

35:21.285 --> 35:23.246
Don't bother.
I'm going out.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.126
BRIDGET:
I got your text.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.377
ANDREW:
Thanks for coming.

35:29.418 --> 35:31.420
The doorman says
she's inside.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.422
(music playing,
overlapping chatter)

35:38.261 --> 35:39.220
She's there.

35:41.848 --> 35:42.974
Again?

35:43.015 --> 35:44.475
Wow, this blows.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.606
Code red behind you.
<b></b>
What?

35:50.648 --> 35:51.774
You're joking.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.901
You're here,
both of you?

35:53.943 --> 35:55.528
That way, now.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.376
Juliet, this has got to stop.

36:10.418 --> 36:12.003
What happened is in the past.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.005
But it's not.

36:14.046 --> 36:15.631
She's in my face,

36:15.673 --> 36:17.884
living in my home.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.886
She's the reason
you and Mom aren't together.

36:19.927 --> 36:21.095
She's why Mom moved to Miami.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.680
She is not.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.974
Your mother and I had problems
long before I met Siobhan.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.767
But you could have worked
things out.

36:28.227 --> 36:31.689
If you never met Siobhan,

36:31.731 --> 36:33.983
you and Mom
might have had a chance.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.360
Instead,
you cheated

36:36.402 --> 36:37.820
and it was all over.

36:37.862 --> 36:38.821
You're right.

36:40.740 --> 36:42.742
Your father and I never
should have been together

36:42.783 --> 36:43.993
while he was
still married.

36:44.035 --> 36:44.994
Siobhan, please.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.078
I need to say this.

36:48.789 --> 36:51.709
Juliet, I never meant
to hurt you

36:51.751 --> 36:54.629
or to break up your family,

36:54.670 --> 36:59.133
and if hating me is what helps
you cope, then go for it.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.511
You can trash as many pictures
of me as you'd like,

37:02.553 --> 37:06.140
but you have to stop
hurting your father...

37:06.182 --> 37:07.183
and yourself.

37:12.146 --> 37:14.190
And I'm sorry.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.441
ANDREW:
Siobhan,

37:15.483 --> 37:16.817
you shouldn't be
the one apologizing.

37:16.859 --> 37:19.362
If anybody should be sorry,
it's Juliet.

37:19.403 --> 37:20.488
Not this time.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.912
I've done a lot of crappy things

37:27.954 --> 37:29.622
and I would like the chance
to make up for them.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.378
Juliet.

37:38.923 --> 37:39.966
I want to go home.

37:42.176 --> 37:43.886
Why don't I go
get a cab?

37:43.928 --> 37:47.640
Can we stop for something
on the way?

37:47.682 --> 37:49.725
My head is pounding.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.185
I'll, uh, go to
the drugstore.

37:51.227 --> 37:52.186
You'll take her home?

37:54.063 --> 37:55.147
If that's all right with Juliet.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.328
(phone rings)

38:09.370 --> 38:10.746
Hello?

38:10.788 --> 38:12.206
GEMMA (crying over phone):
Andrew, it's me.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.958
Gemma, is everything all right?

38:14.000 --> 38:14.959
No, it's not.

38:15.001 --> 38:16.502
Can you meet me at my house?

38:16.544 --> 38:18.004
I need to tell you something.

38:18.045 --> 38:19.297
Look, it's late.

38:19.338 --> 38:21.215
Please, it's an emergency.

38:41.861 --> 38:42.820
JULIET:
You're doing it wrong.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.341
Gemma.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.389
What are you doing here?

39:10.431 --> 39:12.099
Well, Gemma called,
asked me to come over.

39:12.141 --> 39:15.102
Is everything all right?
<b></b>
Sure.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.270
Well, so is she here?

39:16.312 --> 39:17.605
No, I haven't seen
her all night.

39:17.646 --> 39:20.274
Maybe...maybe she called
you from her office.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.275
Uh, well, can I come in?

39:21.317 --> 39:22.651
I don't mind waiting.

39:22.693 --> 39:27.615
No, I, uh, I've got
some work I got to do.

39:27.656 --> 39:29.033
Talk tomorrow?

39:29.075 --> 39:31.118
Yeah, uh, let her know
that I stopped by.
