I'm in a zappin' mood. Zappity zapptiy zap -- aah!

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
I will soon be moving to the Sheepy Jungle.

We don't have enough folks.

All right, Grup, I --

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
Huh? He's actually here.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
I can't believe he's gracing us with his presence.

Who in the blue blazes is that?

Does it matter? Put me in.

I am famous.  Um...

Sure. Let me show you

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
how it's done.

They'd rather have a guy they've never even heard of play

Wait, so he's  in that box thing?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
He's been here the whole game, hasn't he?

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
I can't believe he'd just take off like that.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Of course he took off.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
You wouldn't let him play the game he invented.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
I'm surprised at you two.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Until you unleashed your inner weirdo,

you weren't playing very well, either.

We never gave Grup a proper chance.

Grup is the weirdest little weirdo we know.

Grup, buddy, we're sorry for being so shortsighted.

We've got astigmatism. Will you help us win the match?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
Won't I just make you guys lose?

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
Absolutely not. We want you to go out there

Get that ball back! This is the game-winning point!

Tall has the ball. I hope he don't fall.
