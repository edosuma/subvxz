WEBVTT

01:32.696 --> 01:34.201
Keep it running.

02:11.537 --> 02:12.404
Woof!

02:23.285 --> 02:25.285
Final notice.

02:26.585 --> 02:31.324
Surprised you and your
filthy brood...

02:31.887 --> 02:33.491
are still here.

02:33.526 --> 02:36.296
I told you. I'm not
giving you the land.

02:36.331 --> 02:39.464
That's the beauty
of it, sweetheart.

02:40.731 --> 02:43.468
It's already mine.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.570
You have 48 hours to evacuate.

02:46.605 --> 02:50.343
Then the bulldozers come in.

02:51.346 --> 02:53.841
The great spectacle...

02:55.317 --> 02:58.010
of progress!

02:58.045 --> 03:01.849
You should stick around
and watch the fireworks.

06:06.739 --> 06:08.838
Yeah. Our house
is basically done.

06:08.873 --> 06:10.510
Stayed up 'til 10 finishing it.

06:10.545 --> 06:11.874
Just now?

06:11.909 --> 06:14.778
Wow. I thought you'd be
done with that by now.

06:14.813 --> 06:17.044
Frank moved our
Halloween stuff to storage.

06:17.079 --> 06:19.046
It took a while to get back.

06:19.081 --> 06:21.521
Is he okay with you
calling him Frank?

06:21.556 --> 06:23.787
What else would I call him?

06:23.822 --> 06:27.054
Anyway, I'm just waiting for
him to hang the darn lights.

06:27.089 --> 06:29.122
Oh, what, you can't
do 'em yourself?

06:30.191 --> 06:31.663
-Oh, come on.

06:31.698 --> 06:33.731
You can't
still be afraid of heights.

06:33.766 --> 06:35.898
That fall was a decade ago.

06:35.933 --> 06:36.965
It was six years.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.032
Oh, yeah. Big difference.

06:38.067 --> 06:40.067
And it's not a
fear of heights.

06:40.102 --> 06:41.541
It's a love of the ground.

06:41.576 --> 06:42.742
-Huh.
-Right, right.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.809
So it's not the fall that scares
you. It's the sudden stop.

06:48.550 --> 06:49.483
Whoah.

06:50.277 --> 06:52.112
Shut the freddy puk.

06:52.147 --> 06:54.620
Pop-up Halloween
store in a creepy lot?

06:54.655 --> 06:55.588
Awesome.

06:59.924 --> 07:00.824
Let me see.

07:03.224 --> 07:05.598
Bummer. It won't upload.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.599
Dead zone?

07:06.634 --> 07:07.567
Dead zone.

07:07.602 --> 07:09.965
-Let's check it out.
-Cool.

07:11.133 --> 07:12.803
Come on, Carson.

07:12.838 --> 07:14.706
I'm coming, Bo Peep.

07:27.215 --> 07:30.282
Or a trick.
Remember this card.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.119
It'll be the last thing--

07:33.727 --> 07:35.254
...you'll ever see!

07:36.090 --> 07:38.532
Dude, saw that
coming a mile away.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.259
Yeah, sure you did. Come on.

07:44.100 --> 07:46.298
We're so coming here
for our costumes.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.644
You two have put it
off long enough.

07:51.679 --> 07:53.272
Yeah, about that.

07:56.717 --> 07:57.947
Look, so I know you're like

07:57.982 --> 08:00.147
a whole year younger
than me basically.

08:00.182 --> 08:02.754
Eight months, Carson. Chill.

08:02.789 --> 08:05.185
Don't forget to duck,

08:05.220 --> 08:07.594
or you'll be a dead
duck.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.391
See, here's the thing.

08:14.361 --> 08:15.193
Eight months from now,

08:15.229 --> 08:16.999
you'll be growing
hair on your chest

08:17.034 --> 08:18.165
and stealing your
dad's aftershave.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.573
He's not my dad.

08:19.608 --> 08:22.169
Wait, you grew hair
on chest? Congrats.

08:22.204 --> 08:23.103
Thanks.

08:23.139 --> 08:25.711
I mean, it's more
like fuzz, but still.

08:26.043 --> 08:29.649
Carson who gives a crap
about your peach fuzz.

08:29.684 --> 08:31.079
What's your point?

08:32.379 --> 08:34.115
I'm not trick or
treating this year.

08:36.086 --> 08:37.052
What?

08:39.122 --> 08:40.286
Halloween's for kids.

08:40.321 --> 08:44.092
We trick or treat every
year. It's what we do.

08:44.963 --> 08:45.995
Bo, tell him.

08:46.030 --> 08:47.832
Yeah, Bo. Tell him.

08:48.835 --> 08:49.801
Yeah.

08:49.836 --> 08:51.803
Well, I mean, it is kind
of cold this year, Jake.

08:51.838 --> 08:54.168
Look, we could do
something actually fun,

08:54.203 --> 08:55.402
like sneak into Ray
Marino's Halloween party.

08:55.438 --> 08:58.073
You'd seriously rather go to
some stupid high school party

08:58.108 --> 08:59.239
you're not even invited to?

08:59.274 --> 09:00.680
We don't have to do that.

09:00.715 --> 09:03.309
I'm just saying we can't
trick or treat forever.

09:05.885 --> 09:07.280
Jake, come on man.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.374
Tell me what you
like about her.

09:35.409 --> 09:39.147
Um, I love her gems
and her orange hair...

09:39.182 --> 09:40.885
-So pretty, right?
-And her teal eyes.

09:41.756 --> 09:43.250
Are you kidding me.

09:43.285 --> 09:45.824
Jake, this is Joanie's
house now too, all right?

09:45.859 --> 09:49.762
I don't care. We don't do
princesses on Halloween.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.995
It's meant to be scary.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.667
Me and dad always
did it scary.

09:53.702 --> 09:55.867
But I wanna be a
princess for Halloween.

09:55.902 --> 09:58.133
Princesses suck.
So that's stupid.

09:58.168 --> 10:00.102
Jake, that is enough.

10:01.743 --> 10:04.744
Honey, honey,
honey, honey.

10:04.779 --> 10:06.405
It's a family tradition.

10:07.342 --> 10:11.685
Well, it might be time
to start a new tradition.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.117
Why don't you finish this.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.660
Seriously?

10:20.960 --> 10:24.159
Are you kidd--? You
know nothing about me!

10:41.178 --> 10:42.177
Hello?

10:59.361 --> 10:59.860
Ahhhh!

10:59.895 --> 11:01.900
Surrender your soul!

11:02.903 --> 11:05.233
-Geez.
-Your face.

11:05.873 --> 11:07.873
Sorry, I couldn't help myself.

11:08.975 --> 11:09.908
Is Carson home?

11:09.943 --> 11:11.503
Oh yeah. He's in his
room hiding from chores.

11:11.538 --> 11:14.209
But who needs him when
I have you, right?

11:14.244 --> 11:15.881
-Wanna help?
-Yeah.

11:16.818 --> 11:18.785
Um, I mean, yes.

11:19.414 --> 11:21.018
Yep, sure.

11:33.395 --> 11:34.999
Related?

11:35.034 --> 11:36.330
She's much better
looking than Carson.

11:45.979 --> 11:47.209
Rah!

11:47.244 --> 11:49.178
Wow. Impressive.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.413
Boy Scouts. Very cute.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.989
What's this?

11:58.024 --> 11:59.793
Oh, that's probably
from Mrs. Tulmeister.

11:59.828 --> 12:01.124
My third grade teacher.

12:01.159 --> 12:03.357
Ms. Dullmeister?
Yeah, I had her too.

12:03.392 --> 12:04.325
You did?

12:04.360 --> 12:07.097
She always hands out
apples instead of candy.

12:07.132 --> 12:09.165
Oh yeah, apples and buttons.

12:09.200 --> 12:11.134
I guess some things
never change.

12:11.169 --> 12:12.399
Can I keep it?

12:12.434 --> 12:14.907
Only if you promise to wear it.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.106
It's not for me.

12:16.141 --> 12:17.074
Hey, not judging.

12:17.109 --> 12:18.944
Who knows that your kids
are into these days?

12:20.948 --> 12:22.310
Yeah.

12:22.345 --> 12:23.212
Who knows?

12:42.035 --> 12:43.463
Miss me so soon?

12:49.911 --> 12:51.174
Where's all your
Star Wars stuff?

12:51.209 --> 12:52.571
Dude, we're gonna be in
high school next year.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.441
It's like you're in denial.

12:54.476 --> 12:57.345
Yeah, but you still
play with toy guns?

12:57.380 --> 12:58.546
That's no toy.

12:58.581 --> 13:01.349
With dart mods, I've got it
to military-grade accuracy.

13:02.990 --> 13:04.484
You gonna change your mind?

13:04.519 --> 13:05.584
On what? Trick or treating?

13:09.163 --> 13:10.424
What's gotten you so whacked
out over trick or treating?

13:10.459 --> 13:12.030
It's just not
that fun anymore.

13:12.065 --> 13:13.198
Yeah.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.462
So hanging out with me and
Bo is not that fun anymore?

13:15.497 --> 13:16.903
Well, Fright Night's
tomorrow night,

13:16.938 --> 13:17.971
which is basically
Halloween anyway.

13:18.006 --> 13:21.039
Basically Halloween
is<i> not</i> Halloween.

13:21.074 --> 13:22.370
Dude, no! Not that one!

13:24.913 --> 13:26.440
Dart mods. Like I said.

13:26.475 --> 13:28.211
We're doing something
Saturday.

13:28.246 --> 13:32.017
The three of us, best holiday
of the year, just like always.

13:32.052 --> 13:32.952
It's gonna be awesome.

13:32.987 --> 13:33.886
All right, all right, sheesh.

13:33.922 --> 13:36.890
Figure it out, but
don't shoot me over it.

13:36.925 --> 13:38.386
Better not be
lame, or I'm out!

14:12.719 --> 14:15.027
Whatcha doing?

14:15.062 --> 14:17.029
Heading out with my friends.

14:17.064 --> 14:20.065
I'm sorry your dad died
'cause of bone cancer.

14:22.564 --> 14:24.201
It was blood cancer.

14:24.236 --> 14:28.304
But yeah, I guess blood's
made in the bones.

14:28.339 --> 14:30.405
Mom says that's why
you're mad all the time.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.604
Uh .

14:32.673 --> 14:34.673
Hey, Frank offered to
take you guys to pick out

14:34.708 --> 14:37.148
your Halloween
costumes tomorrow.

14:37.183 --> 14:39.018
-Yay!
-Yay!

14:39.053 --> 14:41.680
I know it's a little last
minute, but will you go?

14:41.715 --> 14:42.681
Mom...

14:44.190 --> 14:47.158
Mom, no. I'm not even trick
or treating this year.

14:47.193 --> 14:48.092
What are you talking about?

14:48.128 --> 14:50.161
You guys go trick or
treating every year.

14:50.196 --> 14:51.327
Carson thinks we're too old

14:51.362 --> 14:54.297
and Bo's too much
of a wuss to argue.

14:57.038 --> 14:59.973
I'm sorry, honey. I know how
much you look forward to it.

15:00.008 --> 15:02.107
But hey, you
could take Joanie.

15:02.637 --> 15:04.472
-The fairytale princess?
-Mm-hmm.

15:04.507 --> 15:06.342
Yeah, Jake! Please take me.

15:07.708 --> 15:09.114
Okay, go brush
your teeth, honey.

15:09.149 --> 15:10.016
I'm gonna get you!

15:11.349 --> 15:12.480
Look, I need to make en effort

15:12.515 --> 15:14.218
to spend time with
them, all right?

15:14.253 --> 15:15.120
I mean it.

15:17.091 --> 15:19.124
Have a good time tonight.

15:39.509 --> 15:42.444
Oh Alec,
please don't go.

15:42.479 --> 15:44.512
The town's people fear her.

15:44.547 --> 15:46.679
They say she is...different.

15:48.056 --> 15:49.682
Yes, I think it's
high time I paid a visit

15:49.717 --> 15:51.387
-to the old matron.

15:51.422 --> 15:53.521
I am a business man after all,

15:53.556 --> 15:56.128
surely she could
be reasoned with.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.658
I will make her an
offer she can't refuse.

16:05.403 --> 16:08.305
If you must have my
hand, Mr. Windsor-

16:08.340 --> 16:09.240
Wait!

16:09.275 --> 16:11.737
Then you'll have it forever.

16:11.772 --> 16:13.376
She's a witch!

16:18.152 --> 16:22.253
And so it is believed
that the spirit of the deceased

16:22.288 --> 16:24.519
is bound to this dimension.

16:24.554 --> 16:28.787
A body never found,
a curse never broken.

16:29.229 --> 16:32.791
He roams waiting for the
one night of the year:

16:32.826 --> 16:35.068
All Hallow's Eve,

16:35.103 --> 16:39.171
the anniversary of his
death, to claim his way back

16:39.206 --> 16:42.306
from his doom, purgatory.

16:48.710 --> 16:50.116
Do you really think
there's a cursed body

16:50.151 --> 16:51.678
under this town somewhere?

16:51.713 --> 16:52.812
Heck no.

16:52.848 --> 16:54.582
It's just some stupid local
legend to keep kids home

16:54.617 --> 16:56.254
and out trouble on Halloween.

16:56.289 --> 16:59.125
No, I mean Alec Windsor's
definitely a real guy.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.621
He built over half the town.

17:00.656 --> 17:03.525
And one day, he
just disappeared.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.066
Yeah, yeah. It's a mystery.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.300
Hey, who's that
talking to your sister?

17:09.335 --> 17:11.401
Ray Marino? Dang.

17:11.436 --> 17:15.108
Ray Marino? Can he even string
a sentence together?

17:15.407 --> 17:16.439
You don't
need sentences

17:16.474 --> 17:18.342
when you got
touchdowns, bro.

17:18.674 --> 17:22.379
Is he seriously wearing
<i>himself</i> as a costume?

17:27.320 --> 17:28.484
Bye.

17:30.422 --> 17:32.686
So sis, Ray Marino, huh?

17:32.721 --> 17:33.852
None of your business, Carson.

17:33.887 --> 17:34.820
Well, I heard he's throwing

17:34.855 --> 17:35.788
the party of the year tomorrow.

17:35.823 --> 17:39.363
Mm-hmm, and you're not
going. No kids allowed.

17:39.398 --> 17:41.365
Yeah, well, if I'm not
going, then you're not.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.566
Why?

17:42.601 --> 17:44.368
Mom's gonna be out of town
tomorrow and you're in charge.

17:44.403 --> 17:46.799
Carson, you can crash at
my place tomorrow night.

17:46.834 --> 17:50.173
Perfect. Thank you
Jake! I owe you one.

17:54.248 --> 17:56.413
Dude, what was that?
That was our in.

17:56.448 --> 17:58.910
What do you mean, our in?
Carson, read the room.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.683
Besides, we've got
our own awesome plans.

18:02.718 --> 18:04.454
Do we though?

18:04.489 --> 18:07.556
No, but we're
working on it, right?

18:08.559 --> 18:09.625
Right.

18:09.660 --> 18:11.758
We can always just watch
a scary move at my place.

18:11.793 --> 18:14.233
Oh, will your mom
give you milky and cookie?

18:14.268 --> 18:15.498
Could she gimme your blankie?

18:15.863 --> 18:16.762
Dude! Grow a pair.

18:16.798 --> 18:19.205
We need something super
creepy or I'm out.

18:19.240 --> 18:19.898
-I mean it.

18:23.904 --> 18:25.772
You want something
really creepy?

18:25.807 --> 18:28.280
How about a night
locked in here?

18:28.315 --> 18:29.047
What?

18:29.083 --> 18:30.579
The
Halloween Megastore.

18:30.614 --> 18:32.779
Now we're talking.

18:32.814 --> 18:33.912
Are you crazy?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.815
Why the heck would
we wanna do that?

18:35.850 --> 18:37.553
Because we're not giving
up a Halloween tradition

18:37.588 --> 18:39.720
just because Carson
grew a chin hair.

18:40.558 --> 18:43.559
It's<i> chest</i> hair and there's
way more than one, F.Y.I.

18:43.594 --> 18:46.364
-Yeah. No, not in.
-Bo, come on.

18:46.399 --> 18:48.531
Come on Bo-peep, you're
told to be scared of ghosts.

18:48.566 --> 18:50.236
Am I too old to be
scared of the law?

18:50.271 --> 18:53.932
Bo, please. Just one in,
all in. Like always?

18:55.771 --> 18:57.903
My god, you guys
are seriously nuts.

18:57.938 --> 18:59.212
Booya!

19:10.984 --> 19:11.851
Yo.

19:12.820 --> 19:16.724
No, I say Bo's, you
say mine, Bo says yours.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.464
No, I've downloaded
movies on the tablet.

19:22.435 --> 19:23.368
Okay, cool.

19:24.602 --> 19:25.469
Bye.

20:06.644 --> 20:10.481
Hey, trick or treat.
What would you like?

20:20.889 --> 20:22.559
Hey, Grandma G.

20:28.896 --> 20:33.537
Don't stay out late
Jake. You hear me?

20:36.674 --> 20:38.938
Grandma, stop
scaring my friends.

20:38.973 --> 20:42.645
Listen Bo, you
stay safe, please.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.614
-Always.
-Please.

20:44.649 --> 20:45.912
Yes, I know.

21:03.866 --> 21:07.065
So, what's your new
girlfriend Kate up to tonight?

21:07.100 --> 21:09.540
Okay, she's not my
girlfriend.

21:09.575 --> 21:12.972
Besides, Carson's
sister? Come on.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.677
She still thinks
we're little kids.

21:14.712 --> 21:17.482
Half sister...
And we're not.

21:17.517 --> 21:20.452
Yeah, well, she's only
into guys like Ray Marino,

21:20.487 --> 21:22.949
football legend slash town hero

21:22.984 --> 21:26.491
slash party planner
of the century.

21:26.526 --> 21:28.526
Yeah, well, he's too obvious.

21:28.561 --> 21:31.991
Okay, next time
you see her, say

21:32.026 --> 21:34.796
"Hey, are you made of
copper and tellurium?

21:34.831 --> 21:37.095
Because baby, you're cute."

21:38.670 --> 21:41.473
Copper's C U and
Tellurium's T E.

21:42.707 --> 21:44.608
It'll probably work
better on paper.

21:44.643 --> 21:45.939
Boo!

21:45.974 --> 21:47.173
Oh my god, Carson.

21:47.209 --> 21:49.811
It's not a joke if you have
to explain the punchline, dude.

21:49.846 --> 21:50.977
Whatever.

21:51.012 --> 21:53.881
What's that? Gonna
play us some tunes?

21:53.916 --> 21:56.488
Nah, this is gonna
make you guys dance!

22:10.438 --> 22:12.405
Trick or treat, or
illegal trespass?

22:12.440 --> 22:14.737
I feel like there might've
been an option in-between.

22:14.772 --> 22:17.773
Oh come one, Bo-peep,
it'll be be wicked.

22:17.808 --> 22:19.412
This is amazing.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.869
Psst.

22:47.904 --> 22:50.674
Hey Bo, they gone?

23:06.692 --> 23:09.627
What's wrong with you?
It's not even midnight yet.

23:09.662 --> 23:10.892
I think I saw--

23:12.533 --> 23:13.928
The... the... the... what?

23:13.963 --> 23:15.129
The light.

23:15.164 --> 23:17.899
What light? Bo, the store
closed, and we're still inside.

23:17.934 --> 23:19.200
As planned.

23:19.236 --> 23:21.166
You mean the store's locked
and we're<i> trapped</i> inside.

23:26.811 --> 23:28.008
That scared me!

23:28.043 --> 23:30.483
You guys are serious
wusses, you know that?

23:35.787 --> 23:36.686
If only we had peach fuzz

23:36.722 --> 23:39.822
to make us big and
strong like you, Carson.

23:39.857 --> 23:41.054
I gotta take a whizz.

23:41.089 --> 23:42.154
Pretty sure you just did.

24:45.054 --> 24:47.989
I was wrong about
tonight.<i> This</i> is fun.

24:48.024 --> 24:49.727
Hell yeah.

24:49.762 --> 24:53.225
Jakey, you wanna tell
us a scary story?

24:55.636 --> 24:56.735
What was that?

24:56.771 --> 24:59.968
Glitchy generator. Chill.
This building is ancient.

25:00.003 --> 25:01.970
Here's some spare
balls, Bo-Peep.

25:02.005 --> 25:03.675
Yours seem to be missing.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.013
Was that there before?

25:12.048 --> 25:13.982
I'm
gonna say...yes?

25:15.656 --> 25:18.085
Here, how about we share 'em?

25:30.231 --> 25:31.769
Here.

25:31.804 --> 25:34.805
No, sorry. Lactose intolerant.

25:34.840 --> 25:36.741
A man can't live on
Skittles alone.

25:36.776 --> 25:39.040
-Come on, here, just try 'em.
-Fine.

25:42.815 --> 25:46.113
Here, "The Legend
of Alec Windsor".

25:46.148 --> 25:47.752
Where do you think this was?

25:47.787 --> 25:49.688
Who knows. I mean, it
could've been anywhere.

25:50.757 --> 25:52.020
Wait.

25:54.959 --> 25:59.159
Guys, the twin chimneys.
Is that the old mill?

26:00.195 --> 26:01.128
It has to be!

26:01.163 --> 26:03.196
-Hold on. Gimme this.
-Dude!

26:05.805 --> 26:08.267
Holy crap, that's a
few blocks from here!

26:15.111 --> 26:17.342
That was a good Halloween.

26:17.377 --> 26:19.850
Yeah man,
one of the best.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.058
Nope, yeah.

26:30.093 --> 26:31.862
I'm done, too creepy.

26:31.897 --> 26:34.194
Too creepy? This is
why we came here.

26:36.132 --> 26:37.934
Trick or treat?

26:37.969 --> 26:41.839
Remember this card, it'll
be the last thing...

26:47.011 --> 26:47.878
Yikes.

26:52.478 --> 26:55.688
I told you it was
an old building.

26:55.723 --> 26:57.415
We should find the breaker box.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.890
We should find an exit.

26:59.925 --> 27:01.386
Come on wimps. I bet
it's in the back.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.191
See, Bo is always right.

27:04.226 --> 27:05.929
This is how every
horror movie starts.

27:23.047 --> 27:23.947
Hi, Mama.

27:25.214 --> 27:26.444
Yeah, everything's great.

27:26.479 --> 27:28.853
I'm on my way to
the party right now.

27:28.888 --> 27:31.086
Carson is at Jake's for
the night. Remember?

27:31.121 --> 27:32.989
Yes, I made sure to
turn off all the lights.

27:33.959 --> 27:35.354
Yes, I--

27:35.389 --> 27:39.699
Yes. I also made sure that
Carson took his phone.

27:41.032 --> 27:43.329
Relax Mama, I've
got this, seriously.

27:43.529 --> 27:46.299
Everyone's great. I promise.

27:46.334 --> 27:47.333
All right.

27:47.368 --> 27:48.708
Love you. Bye.

27:51.845 --> 27:53.306
Darn it, Carson.

28:11.425 --> 28:13.865
-Oh my god!
-Seriously?!

28:13.900 --> 28:16.835
Oh my god, give a kid
a heart attack. Jeez!

28:19.367 --> 28:20.938
So we're good then. Right?

28:34.217 --> 28:35.480
-Kate? Hi.
-Hi.

28:36.285 --> 28:39.121
Frank, I said pause
it. I'm sorry.

28:40.190 --> 28:40.956
Happy Halloween!

28:40.991 --> 28:42.927
Um, Carson left
his phone at home

28:42.962 --> 28:44.390
and Mom likes him
reachable, so.

28:45.459 --> 28:47.393
The boys aren't here,
they're all at Bo's.

28:47.428 --> 28:50.869
Oh. Oh my gosh,
you're right. Sorry.

28:50.904 --> 28:52.003
It's okay.

28:52.039 --> 28:56.039
Hey, Carson didn't say he
was staying here, did he?

28:56.074 --> 28:58.404
No, no, I blanked.
Sorry about that.

28:58.439 --> 28:59.812
I will swing by there.

28:59.847 --> 29:01.407
-Have fun!
-Okay.

29:17.491 --> 29:18.930
Hi, Grandma G.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.342
-No one's home, Kate.

29:35.377 --> 29:36.244
Okay.

29:37.346 --> 29:39.049
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

29:39.084 --> 29:41.348
It's late, child. Go home.

29:42.417 --> 29:43.856
Okay.

29:43.891 --> 29:44.549
Bye.

30:17.958 --> 30:20.090
You little brats.

30:36.372 --> 30:38.009
-Gimme this.
-Bro!

30:39.012 --> 30:41.507
Will Bo die never been kissed?

30:45.051 --> 30:46.281
Too bad, so sad.

30:47.284 --> 30:48.382
Will Carson?

30:49.583 --> 30:51.220
Dude. Unoriginal.

30:52.652 --> 30:55.620
How the heck do I
get out of here?

30:58.394 --> 31:00.460
Ask
the right questions,

31:00.495 --> 31:02.627
you'll get the right answers.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.598
Like that's not creepy.

31:14.608 --> 31:16.608
This thing is awesome.

31:18.381 --> 31:23.120
Ask the right questions,
you'll get the right answers.

31:24.255 --> 31:26.156
Is the town haunted
by a lost spirit?

31:26.191 --> 31:28.389
Is Alec Windsor
roaming tonight?

31:28.424 --> 31:31.656
Are you two serious right now?

31:35.398 --> 31:36.430
Really?

31:36.465 --> 31:38.036
So does he want something?

31:38.071 --> 31:40.533
Or is he here to
like, hang out?

31:45.177 --> 31:46.572
What does he want?

32:08.134 --> 32:11.102
-You!

32:18.540 --> 32:23.543
The reaper
comes in dark of night.

32:27.252 --> 32:29.384
And so do I!

32:35.491 --> 32:37.326
-Bo!
-Nighty night!

32:43.664 --> 32:47.435
I only need one of
you to get to sleep.

32:47.470 --> 32:51.505
Now, who wants a lullaby?

32:54.411 --> 32:58.182
Fee fi fo fum,

32:58.217 --> 33:00.646
I smell the blood

33:00.681 --> 33:04.386
of some child-like scum.

33:07.358 --> 33:09.127
What the heck just happened?

33:09.162 --> 33:10.128
I don't know.

33:10.163 --> 33:11.393
But I'd love my guitar
case right about now.

33:11.428 --> 33:13.593
Forget the guitar!

33:13.628 --> 33:15.562
We can overtake it if
we catch it by surprise.

33:15.597 --> 33:16.630
Are you kidding me?

33:16.665 --> 33:18.367
It's like The Hulk trapped
in the reaper's body.

33:18.402 --> 33:19.665
We'll rip its legs off!

33:19.700 --> 33:20.899
Dude, gross.

33:20.935 --> 33:24.142
-It's not like it'll bleed.
-It'll possess something else.

33:24.177 --> 33:26.375
Maybe something smaller.

33:43.856 --> 33:44.622
Dude.

33:44.657 --> 33:47.396
I told you,
lactose intolerant.

33:47.431 --> 33:50.102
-Woof!

33:50.137 --> 33:51.862
-Come on, go, we gotta go!
-Go, go, go!

33:56.638 --> 33:57.703
Kids.

34:02.710 --> 34:05.084
Filthy rodents!

34:10.487 --> 34:12.619
Time to sleep.

34:14.821 --> 34:16.458
Hold still.

34:16.493 --> 34:17.624
Carson, now!

34:21.630 --> 34:22.728
Jake, come on!

34:40.748 --> 34:43.485
Good thinking
with the mirror.

34:47.854 --> 34:49.524
No more candy, Bo.

35:16.784 --> 35:18.487
<i>Hey, it's Lydia.</i>

35:18.522 --> 35:20.555
<i>Sorry I missed you.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

35:28.499 --> 35:31.170
-Hey, Mrs. T.

35:32.272 --> 35:33.964
Hey, wait, you're break--

35:33.999 --> 35:35.570
Yeah, you're breaking
up. Sorry, what?

35:35.605 --> 35:37.704
Look, Jake's phone
just seems like

35:37.739 --> 35:40.938
it's out of service
range somehow,

35:40.973 --> 35:44.810
but did you talk to them or
did you only talk to Lydia?

35:44.845 --> 35:46.647
<i> Hello?</i>

35:46.682 --> 35:47.549
Kate?

35:48.717 --> 35:50.849
Kate, can you hear?

35:50.884 --> 35:53.885
Hi. Yeah, sorry, you cut out.

35:53.920 --> 35:55.557
But you know kids
and their phones.

35:55.592 --> 35:58.692
Never charge 'em and
never on 'em, right?

35:58.727 --> 36:00.397
No, but yeah, but
they're doing great.

36:00.993 --> 36:05.204
Okay, well that's a
relief, thank you Kate.

36:06.339 --> 36:09.571
-Have a good night.
-Okay, all right, bye.

36:25.754 --> 36:26.918
God damn, Carson.

36:30.495 --> 36:33.727
You think Jake will
ever change his mind?

36:33.762 --> 36:34.926
About what, honey?

36:34.961 --> 36:37.962
About taking me
trick or treating.

36:39.933 --> 36:43.605
I guess I would just
say, you never know.

36:44.707 --> 36:47.642
Your brother's kinda
silly sometimes.

36:48.546 --> 36:51.745
Hey, did you get that tonight?

36:51.780 --> 36:54.649
No, I thought you or
Dad left it for me.

36:54.684 --> 36:55.947
I found it by my bed.

36:58.589 --> 36:59.852
No. We didn't.

37:02.626 --> 37:04.890
But I love that someone did.

37:13.901 --> 37:15.604
This is so stupid.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.795
So what the heck are we
dealing with here, Bo?

37:41.830 --> 37:43.632
How should I know?
Jake's the horror geek.

37:43.667 --> 37:46.569
All right, Jake, best
guess? Dude, come on.

37:46.604 --> 37:47.900
A spirit that can't
let go of this life,

37:47.935 --> 37:49.638
possibly someone who died here.

37:49.673 --> 37:51.409
Alec Windsor.

37:51.444 --> 37:52.343
I don't know who it is,

37:52.379 --> 37:55.039
but I don't think
they wanna be friends.

37:55.074 --> 37:59.483
Theoretically, if it is
all that, what could it do?

38:00.486 --> 38:01.485
Well, I need my book.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.717
But based on what we've seen,

38:02.752 --> 38:04.587
I'd say affect things
or possess them.

38:04.622 --> 38:05.786
What's the difference?

38:05.821 --> 38:07.425
Well, one's making things move

38:07.460 --> 38:09.361
and the other's
bringing things to life.

38:09.396 --> 38:09.889
Like the reaper!

38:09.924 --> 38:11.057
Great.

38:11.092 --> 38:12.595
So I guess we've got Jake
to thank for this crapshoot.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.091
Carson, chill out.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.763
You wanted to come here.

38:15.798 --> 38:18.029
No, dude, I wanted to
go to a cool party.

38:18.064 --> 38:19.230
You wanted to come here.

38:19.265 --> 38:21.098
Only 'cause you were too selfish
to do what we usually do!

38:21.133 --> 38:23.573
Oh, and what's that? Stay
10-years-olds forever?

38:23.608 --> 38:24.507
Guys, come on,
let's just--

38:24.543 --> 38:26.136
Wanting to change
things up isn't a crime,

38:26.171 --> 38:27.137
last I checked, Jake.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.578
You should try it sometime;

38:28.613 --> 38:30.382
might make you more
fun to be around.

38:41.824 --> 38:43.087
What was that?

38:48.732 --> 38:49.599
Guys?

38:55.772 --> 38:56.639
Idiots.

38:58.907 --> 39:00.709
Guys, where are you?!

39:01.074 --> 39:02.546
Was that Kate?

39:31.071 --> 39:31.905
Hi.

39:31.940 --> 39:33.038
How did you get in here?

39:33.073 --> 39:34.446
I broke in.

39:34.481 --> 39:35.744
Guys, you know how
insane this is?

39:35.779 --> 39:38.582
Good job, sis. Let's go!

39:38.617 --> 39:41.112
We have to go!
We'll explain later.

39:41.147 --> 39:42.652
Hey!

40:09.714 --> 40:12.176
You guys are in serious
trouble. This place is wrecked.

40:12.211 --> 40:14.145
Kate! Where did you break in?

40:14.180 --> 40:15.817
I know you're not
yelling at me.

40:15.852 --> 40:17.489
You're the little brat
who left his phone at home

40:17.524 --> 40:18.557
and lied about where he is.

40:18.592 --> 40:20.591
And now I'm missing my
party because the three--

40:20.626 --> 40:21.724
-Kate.
-What?

40:21.759 --> 40:24.892
Please. Just,
where's the window?

40:24.927 --> 40:27.664
What? You came in
through the roof?

40:27.699 --> 40:28.731
Yeah.

40:28.766 --> 40:30.931
Okay Bo, you're the lightest.

40:30.966 --> 40:32.130
Yeah, and I'm also the weakest.

40:32.165 --> 40:32.999
True.

40:33.034 --> 40:34.033
We'll boost you up.

40:34.069 --> 40:35.606
You can go open the doors
when you're outside.

40:35.938 --> 40:37.102
They're dead bolted, genius.

40:37.137 --> 40:39.236
We're all gonna have
to climb out this way!

40:39.271 --> 40:41.645
All right, come on Jake,
it's not that high.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.412
Try falling from up there,

40:42.448 --> 40:43.647
then tell me it's
not that high.

40:49.622 --> 40:51.490
Hey, how is
that bear moving?

40:52.284 --> 40:53.591
You don't wanna know.

40:53.626 --> 40:56.088
Need to warm up
these legs.

40:56.123 --> 40:58.497
Someone overstuffed this guy.

40:59.863 --> 41:03.260
Just so we're all
clear on the rules,

41:03.295 --> 41:06.769
I can't leave here
without a body.

41:06.804 --> 41:08.639
That's a weird thing to say.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.299
Bo, hustle!

41:09.334 --> 41:10.166
I can't reach it!

41:10.202 --> 41:12.742
Welcome to the
party, princess.

41:12.777 --> 41:15.547
Oh my god, oh my god, oh
my god! What's happening!?

41:15.582 --> 41:16.977
The store is
trying to kill us.

41:17.012 --> 41:18.209
Carson, help!

41:20.246 --> 41:22.147
-Here.
-What?

41:22.182 --> 41:23.720
-I don't know.
-A pumpkin?

41:28.859 --> 41:29.825
Bo, move it!

41:29.860 --> 41:30.958
It's not enough, I need--

41:30.993 --> 41:32.157
I can't, we gotta go.

41:32.192 --> 41:33.598
It's too late. Bail!

41:33.633 --> 41:35.226
Oh my god, Bo. What?

41:35.261 --> 41:36.128
Come on!

41:40.937 --> 41:41.804
Help!

41:44.204 --> 41:47.040
Hope you like earth,
you filthy maggot.

41:47.075 --> 41:48.041
Help me!

41:48.076 --> 41:49.306
-Bo, hold on!
-Hold on.

41:49.341 --> 41:52.111
'Cause you're
about to eat dirt!

41:52.146 --> 41:53.651
All right, distract it.

41:53.686 --> 41:55.147
We'll get Bo, and get
back to the storeroom.

41:55.182 --> 41:56.016
Okay.

42:01.155 --> 42:03.155
Oh my god, I'm gonna die!

42:05.225 --> 42:06.763
Hey Ted!

42:16.236 --> 42:19.303
Not so fast.

42:22.781 --> 42:24.143
Let me go, you
demonic bear!

42:24.178 --> 42:25.342
Hey, take this.

42:35.156 --> 42:37.189
-Where's my case?
-Who cares!

42:37.224 --> 42:39.631
I just need one
of you runts!

42:43.428 --> 42:44.094
Wait!

42:45.265 --> 42:47.133
-Go, go, go, go!
-Jake, come on!

42:47.168 --> 42:48.398
-Jake!
-Dude!

42:52.140 --> 42:53.040
Keep it shut!

42:54.813 --> 42:56.340
Go, go, Bo!
Hurry! Please!

42:59.279 --> 42:59.811
Come on!

42:59.846 --> 43:00.712
This is crazy.

43:00.747 --> 43:01.346
You guys couldn't
do something simple,

43:01.381 --> 43:02.852
like camp in the backyard?

43:02.887 --> 43:03.985
Backyard camping's for kids.

43:04.020 --> 43:05.253
Exactly!

43:05.288 --> 43:07.120
What do we do, what do we do,
what do we do, what do we do?

43:07.155 --> 43:09.859
Teddykins wants in.

43:09.894 --> 43:11.190
Jake, come on,
give us something!

43:11.225 --> 43:13.929
-Hold on.
-Yeah, hurry up!

43:13.964 --> 43:16.129
Here, hauntings, malicious.

43:16.164 --> 43:17.361
Tortured spirits,
cursed to Earth,

43:17.396 --> 43:18.295
or reluctant
to cross over,

43:18.331 --> 43:20.001
express themselves
through angry outbursts

43:20.036 --> 43:21.101
of energetic phenomena.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.872
Tortured spirits?

43:23.975 --> 43:25.138
For one hour on the
anniversary of their death,

43:25.173 --> 43:26.645
they can possess things...

43:28.176 --> 43:29.307
or people.

43:29.342 --> 43:30.407
Seriously?

43:30.442 --> 43:32.046
What? Are you freaking
kidding me?

43:32.081 --> 43:34.147
It says here you
need to be asleep

43:34.182 --> 43:35.753
or unconscious to be possessed.

43:35.788 --> 43:36.987
Well, I guess I'm good.

43:37.023 --> 43:38.250
'Cause I'm not sleeping for the
rest of my life after this!

43:38.285 --> 43:39.416
Oh my god, oh my god.

43:41.189 --> 43:43.024
Here's Teddykins!

43:47.261 --> 43:48.865
Dude, bug spray?

43:49.868 --> 43:51.769
-You got a better idea?
-100 of 'em.

43:51.804 --> 43:53.430
There has to be
another way out!

43:53.465 --> 43:55.267
There better be. That
or we're dead.

43:58.470 --> 43:59.876
Blueprints!

43:59.911 --> 44:00.943
Maybe there are floor
plans or something,

44:00.978 --> 44:02.373
they could show us a way out!

44:02.408 --> 44:03.308
Uh, yeah.

44:19.128 --> 44:21.128
-You mean, like this?

44:23.429 --> 44:25.033
Everything okay?

44:27.169 --> 44:29.169
I'm not sure.

44:29.204 --> 44:31.006
-Jake?
-Yeah.

44:31.041 --> 44:33.404
It's just he's not answering his
phone and neither is Lydia.

44:34.913 --> 44:38.178
They're probably all in a
candy coma, fast asleep by now.

44:41.051 --> 44:43.854
He's with his
buddies, he's fine.

44:45.055 --> 44:46.989
I won't be gone long.

44:56.429 --> 44:59.034
Okay, here we
are. Access door?

44:59.069 --> 45:01.168
-Access to what?
-Maybe a basement space?

45:02.369 --> 45:04.105
Where is it?

45:04.140 --> 45:04.908
Right, right here.

45:20.893 --> 45:21.826
Hey guys?

45:21.861 --> 45:24.290
Uh! Where do you
think you're going?

45:25.865 --> 45:27.425
-Fan-freakin-tastic.

45:27.460 --> 45:29.900
I need something stronger.

45:29.935 --> 45:32.166
We gotta get out of here.

45:45.918 --> 45:47.511
-It's freezing.
-Yeah.

45:47.546 --> 45:49.920
-Here, just take this.
-Oh, thank you.

45:58.095 --> 46:00.293
It just goes down.

46:21.019 --> 46:22.480
What is this place?

46:23.516 --> 46:25.582
Well, it's not an exit.

46:31.898 --> 46:32.556
Guys.

46:38.465 --> 46:42.137
Sacred Hearts home
for Wayward Children.

46:47.045 --> 46:48.275
The orphanage.

46:48.310 --> 46:49.947
This is it.

46:49.982 --> 46:52.345
We've been right on top
of it this whole time!

46:52.380 --> 46:54.314
The same picture
is in my book.

47:14.204 --> 47:15.533
Hey guys, I think
I found our exit.

47:36.721 --> 47:40.294
Uh. Ahhhh!

47:41.297 --> 47:45.101
I need to find
one with hands.

48:12.064 --> 48:16.099
Holy cow. This must have
been a coal mine or something.

48:16.464 --> 48:18.299
Or an insane bootlegging den.

48:18.730 --> 48:20.433
What's a bootlegging den?

48:20.468 --> 48:22.567
You'll learn about
it when you're older.

48:22.602 --> 48:25.339
Like high school? Less
than a year from now?

48:25.374 --> 48:26.604
Sure, Carson.

48:28.047 --> 48:31.378
Yeah! Oh, that'll do.

48:31.611 --> 48:34.480
That'll do just fine.

48:51.499 --> 48:53.235
It's, it's, it's...

48:53.270 --> 48:54.467
Spit it out, Bo Peep!

48:54.502 --> 48:55.334
Whoa.

48:55.370 --> 48:57.734
-It's him.
-Alec Windsor.

48:57.769 --> 48:59.373
Like the legend?

49:00.376 --> 49:02.211
-No way.
-Yes way.

49:02.246 --> 49:04.180
So they just dumped
his body down here?

49:04.215 --> 49:07.117
That's sick. And
not the good sick.

49:42.385 --> 49:43.714
Hey, hey, wait.

49:45.157 --> 49:47.520
If we make it out
of here alive,

49:47.555 --> 49:50.622
I think I'm gonna take your
advice and go for it with Kate.

49:50.657 --> 49:51.656
Seriously?

49:51.691 --> 49:52.591
Yeah.

49:52.626 --> 49:54.494
I mean, I'm no football hero,

49:54.529 --> 49:57.662
but after this we'll sure
as heck be legends, right?

49:57.697 --> 49:58.564
Yeah.

49:59.567 --> 50:01.765
Yeah, eat dust, Ray Marino.

50:33.502 --> 50:34.468
Holy cow.

50:53.489 --> 50:55.687
How creepy is this?

51:07.338 --> 51:09.173
-Whoa!

51:09.208 --> 51:09.866
What?

51:11.441 --> 51:12.704
Don't do that.

51:15.775 --> 51:17.742
What's the
point of this?

51:24.784 --> 51:26.355
Ew. Ew, ew, ew.

51:35.762 --> 51:38.169
Carson, do you still
have that stupid lighter?

51:38.204 --> 51:40.336
Oh yeah, here.

52:05.297 --> 52:07.561
There he
is. Alec Windsor.

52:13.899 --> 52:16.372
"Burn three things
he haunts with glee,

52:16.407 --> 52:18.803
"seal with a sacrifice
to set him free.

52:18.838 --> 52:21.212
"If by midnight
he inhabits thee,

52:21.247 --> 52:24.677
"your body he'll
take for eternity."

52:24.712 --> 52:27.383
Do you think that's
the antidote?

52:27.418 --> 52:31.354
Well, if a curse can be cast,
maybe it can be retracted?

52:31.389 --> 52:32.685
Wait, so if it
inhabits our body,

52:32.720 --> 52:35.193
it can keep it for...eternity?

52:36.460 --> 52:39.362
Yeah, no. This
doesn't sound fun,

52:40.464 --> 52:42.266
apart from the
superhuman strength.

52:48.736 --> 52:49.669
Screw this. Let's
get out of here.

52:56.480 --> 52:57.611
Shut the door!

53:30.877 --> 53:32.514
Okay, he's made out of plastic
and polyester, right?

53:32.549 --> 53:34.043
-Carson give me your lighter!

53:34.078 --> 53:35.484
-Why?
-Give me your lighter!

53:35.519 --> 53:36.551
Okay!

53:36.586 --> 53:37.453
Here.

53:41.019 --> 53:43.360
Everything's soggy down here!

53:43.395 --> 53:44.559
I need some kind of fuel.

53:44.594 --> 53:45.293
What?

53:57.035 --> 54:00.707
-Ow, ow, ow!

54:05.010 --> 54:06.845
Go, go! Go, go!

54:14.019 --> 54:14.886
Bo!

54:25.129 --> 54:26.733
What are you doing? Come on!

54:26.768 --> 54:28.504
Trust me! Throw
me the spray can!

54:33.676 --> 54:36.578
Hey, Windsor! Are you made
of lithium and tritium?

54:36.613 --> 54:38.448
'Cause baby, you are lit!

54:51.727 --> 54:53.628
-Come on.
-Come, Bo, come on.

54:56.996 --> 54:59.436
-Bo, that was awesome.
-Yeah Bo. Nice.

54:59.471 --> 55:02.098
Ladies and gentleman, chemistry.

55:04.674 --> 55:08.412
Come on, let's get
back to the hatch!

55:08.447 --> 55:09.776
Race you to
the top, Jake!

55:09.811 --> 55:11.382
Last one out owes
me five bucks.

55:15.982 --> 55:17.113
Oh, dang it!

55:18.754 --> 55:20.116
There is literally no way out!

55:20.151 --> 55:22.019
We're all gonna die in here.

55:22.626 --> 55:26.056
Well, Kate, at least
we go down together.

55:28.632 --> 55:29.862
You know I'm
actually pretty impressed

55:29.897 --> 55:31.501
that you guys
lasted this long.

55:32.438 --> 55:34.603
It's kind of legendary.

55:34.638 --> 55:36.374
Thanks for noticing.

55:40.138 --> 55:43.942
Those despicable,

55:44.813 --> 55:47.143
wretched brats!

55:47.816 --> 55:51.719
This will end tonight!

56:03.227 --> 56:04.094
What?

56:09.607 --> 56:10.639
It's coming.

56:10.674 --> 56:13.169
And it's getting stronger.

56:13.204 --> 56:16.172
You know what? Enough running.

56:16.207 --> 56:19.076
We have to stop
Windsor, for good.

56:20.519 --> 56:22.585
All right, Bo.

56:22.620 --> 56:24.015
Let's do this.

56:26.624 --> 56:30.428
No, no. No, I'm not
doing whatever that is.

56:32.058 --> 56:33.662
Booya!

56:41.507 --> 56:43.837
"Burn three things
he haunts with glee,

56:43.872 --> 56:46.774
seal with a sacrifice
to set him free."

56:46.809 --> 56:49.909
We've already burned
one thing. So, two more?

56:49.944 --> 56:52.208
"Sealed with a sacrifice"
sounds like a ritual.

56:52.243 --> 56:53.814
Maybe we should burn three
things together,

56:53.849 --> 56:54.848
just to be sure?

56:55.147 --> 56:56.685
What's the sacrifice?

56:56.720 --> 56:58.082
Like an animal?

56:59.987 --> 57:01.053
No, no.

57:01.088 --> 57:02.922
It's more like something
that means a lot to someone.

57:02.957 --> 57:05.496
Oh, it's like
Carson's chest hair?

57:06.257 --> 57:07.960
Very funny.

57:07.995 --> 57:09.194
Here.

57:09.230 --> 57:11.898
"A sacrifice is often used to
release a spirit from limbo.

57:11.933 --> 57:12.998
An offering of high importance

57:13.033 --> 57:14.571
that's different for everyone.

57:14.606 --> 57:18.509
For the hungry - food.
For the poor - currency."

57:18.544 --> 57:20.071
For the grieving, a
photo of their dad.

57:20.106 --> 57:21.644
Carson.

57:21.679 --> 57:22.843
What did you just say?

57:22.878 --> 57:24.482
-Here, I have this.
-Nothing.

57:26.112 --> 57:28.486
It was my
grandmother's locket.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.213
Kate, dude.

57:30.248 --> 57:32.050
It's okay. Take it.

57:35.594 --> 57:37.528
You're the horror geek, so.

57:49.102 --> 57:50.266
Okay, what else
did it possess?

57:50.301 --> 57:52.136
-The Fortune Teller!
-Okay, I'll get it.

58:09.991 --> 58:10.990
What's up?

58:12.664 --> 58:14.763
The necklace. It's gone.

58:14.798 --> 58:16.028
What? How?

58:16.063 --> 58:17.799
It was right here.

58:19.605 --> 58:22.672
Hey, we need to
use something else.

58:24.808 --> 58:27.006
Jake, it's just a photo.

58:27.041 --> 58:29.646
Yeah, exactly.
It's just a photo.

58:29.681 --> 58:32.946
Oh good, you got it! I
couldn't find anything else.

58:32.981 --> 58:36.686
Kate, I lost your
necklace. I'm so sorry.

58:37.821 --> 58:39.150
Jake, how?

58:39.185 --> 58:41.185
Jake has a photo with
his dad. We can use that.

58:41.220 --> 58:42.252
Tell him, Bo.

58:43.255 --> 58:46.091
I mean, I don't know.
Is there something else?

58:46.126 --> 58:47.730
Man the heck up for
once and tell him

58:47.765 --> 58:49.930
he's the only one with
something here to sacrifice.

58:49.965 --> 58:50.997
You don't know that!

58:51.032 --> 58:52.801
<i>Everyone</i> knows that!

58:52.836 --> 58:55.100
Jake, we need to at least try.

58:55.135 --> 58:57.036
Look, we're all sorry
you lost your dad, dude,

58:57.071 --> 58:58.037
but at least you had one.

58:58.072 --> 58:59.643
Give it a rest, Carson!

58:59.678 --> 59:01.777
We're here now, alive. No
thanks to you, by the way.

59:01.812 --> 59:03.207
Carson, chill out!

59:03.242 --> 59:04.241
Hey.

59:04.881 --> 59:05.748
Hey!

59:08.819 --> 59:09.752
Guys.

59:09.787 --> 59:12.821
This is ridiculous,
you two. Stop, grow up!

59:12.856 --> 59:14.757
You act like you know
everything, but you don't!

59:14.792 --> 59:16.187
Obsessing over gym
freaks on your phone

59:16.222 --> 59:17.892
doesn't make you
a grown up, Carson!

59:17.927 --> 59:20.092
Growing up means a lot of things
you don't know jack about,

59:20.127 --> 59:23.161
like letting go of the past
and accepting things change.

59:23.196 --> 59:25.867
Or having a darn opinion even
when no one else likes it.

59:26.771 --> 59:30.102
Who knows, maybe growing
up means growing apart.

59:30.137 --> 59:31.268
See you kids later.

59:31.303 --> 59:32.676
Carson!

59:32.711 --> 59:34.205
You wanna know my
opinion, Carson?

59:34.240 --> 59:36.207
Sure, Jake needs to
stop avoiding change,

59:36.242 --> 59:37.780
but you need to
stop forcing it!

59:37.815 --> 59:38.748
It's gonna happen,

59:38.783 --> 59:40.849
with or without you
two fools interfering.

59:40.884 --> 59:42.818
So both of you grow up!

59:47.418 --> 59:50.122
Just forget about him,
we have to get this done.

1:00:05.436 --> 1:00:07.304
Okay, fortune
teller's one,

1:00:07.339 --> 1:00:09.647
reaper's two, and
teddy's three.

1:00:11.079 --> 1:00:12.683
We need the sacrifice.

1:00:27.194 --> 1:00:28.798
You should do it.

1:00:39.173 --> 1:00:40.436
Whoah!

1:00:40.471 --> 1:00:41.305
Kate!

1:00:48.820 --> 1:00:49.619
Kate?

1:00:52.417 --> 1:00:55.055
Go. Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:01:14.846 --> 1:01:19.112
-Jackpot!

1:01:28.024 --> 1:01:28.891
Hi!

1:01:56.448 --> 1:01:58.514
Your girlfriend
is a little scary.

1:01:58.549 --> 1:02:00.252
You mean my sister?

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:03.123
Oh, so you're back
to play with us kids?

1:02:03.158 --> 1:02:07.193
You guys are gonna
need me. Let's move it.

1:02:12.904 --> 1:02:15.905
-What the hell?

1:02:21.176 --> 1:02:23.209
Oh baby, there you are.

1:02:24.608 --> 1:02:26.047
We don't have a sacrifice.

1:02:26.082 --> 1:02:29.281
Yes we do. The
Encyclopedia of Shadows.

1:02:29.316 --> 1:02:31.448
It was a gift from my dad.

1:02:34.585 --> 1:02:36.420
Let's get that
sucker back then.

1:02:36.455 --> 1:02:38.356
Only 10 minutes till midnight.

1:02:38.391 --> 1:02:40.094
Okay.

1:02:40.129 --> 1:02:41.194
For Kate.

1:03:05.022 --> 1:03:05.955
Up there!

1:03:09.224 --> 1:03:12.060
Windsor's using her to
control the monsters.

1:03:29.244 --> 1:03:30.606
Okay, I have a plan.

1:03:30.641 --> 1:03:32.883
Carson, pull the creeps off.

1:03:32.918 --> 1:03:33.983
Bo, cover me.

1:03:36.955 --> 1:03:39.021
Jake, don't be stupid!

1:03:50.100 --> 1:03:52.496
Yo, Dead Heads! Wanna dance?

1:04:20.691 --> 1:04:24.066
Hey Kate, you're
not being very nice!

1:04:27.170 --> 1:04:30.138
Stop pestering
me, you little twit!

1:04:44.550 --> 1:04:45.417
Jake!

1:04:47.190 --> 1:04:48.057
Hello!

1:04:56.562 --> 1:04:57.461
Okay.

1:05:05.472 --> 1:05:06.405
Ah, no!

1:05:14.151 --> 1:05:15.348
Stay back.

1:05:34.501 --> 1:05:35.467
Hey, you!

1:05:38.373 --> 1:05:40.736
Give it up, kid.
I'm warning you!

1:05:40.771 --> 1:05:44.542
I get it! You want
your old life back!

1:05:44.577 --> 1:05:49.085
But that body you're in
belongs to my girlfriend!

1:06:02.199 --> 1:06:03.132
I got it!

1:06:04.135 --> 1:06:05.233
Guys, now!

1:06:13.177 --> 1:06:15.078
-We need some more!
-Got 'em!

1:06:28.324 --> 1:06:32.326
No, no, no!

1:06:43.537 --> 1:06:44.404
Jake!

1:06:45.737 --> 1:06:47.003
<i> It's a</i>
<i>family tradition.</i>

1:06:47.039 --> 1:06:50.278
<i> Mom says that's why</i>
<i>you're mad all the time.</i>

1:06:58.156 --> 1:06:59.452
No, no, no, no!

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:39.327
Like I said, couldn't
you do something simpler

1:07:39.362 --> 1:07:42.198
like camp in the backyard?

1:07:42.233 --> 1:07:44.662
Backyard camping's for kids.

1:07:45.632 --> 1:07:46.664
Whoah, Jake.

1:07:49.735 --> 1:07:51.735
I love you, you're my hero,

1:07:51.770 --> 1:07:53.770
but that is never
gonna happen.

1:07:53.805 --> 1:07:54.903
I'm your hero?

1:07:54.938 --> 1:07:58.544
Sure.

1:07:58.579 --> 1:08:00.447
Ugh, what is that
god-awful smell?

1:08:00.482 --> 1:08:02.878
Oh, it's Carson, it's
singed hair.

1:08:02.913 --> 1:08:05.518
Yeah, Carson, we
needed a sacrifice.

1:08:05.553 --> 1:08:07.124
Yeah, took it while
you were sleeping.

1:08:08.688 --> 1:08:10.721
Very funny, numbskulls.

1:08:10.756 --> 1:08:13.625
Best Halloween<i> ever.</i>

1:08:14.496 --> 1:08:16.166
Booya!

1:08:18.236 --> 1:08:19.598
No, I'm still not saying it.

1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:21.567
Come on.

1:08:24.638 --> 1:08:28.310
Kate, maybe next year we
throw our own Halloween party.

1:08:28.345 --> 1:08:30.444
One to outdo Ray Marino.

1:08:32.448 --> 1:08:36.153
Well, you'll be in
high school, so maybe.

1:08:37.354 --> 1:08:38.188
Mom?

1:08:38.223 --> 1:08:39.387
-Jake!
-Mom?

1:08:39.422 --> 1:08:42.291
Oh, thank
god you're okay.

1:08:42.326 --> 1:08:43.459
I was so worried.

1:08:44.691 --> 1:08:48.594
What in the world is going
on? Why are you even out here?

1:08:48.629 --> 1:08:50.365
-What were you thinking?
-Mom.

1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:52.235
You have all got a lot
of explaining to do.

1:08:52.270 --> 1:08:53.698
It's my fault,
Mrs. T. I'm sorry.

1:08:53.733 --> 1:08:55.832
Kate, it's fine.

1:08:55.867 --> 1:08:57.537
Mom, I'll explain everything.

1:08:57.572 --> 1:08:59.539
Just can I walk home
with my friends?

1:08:59.574 --> 1:09:00.441
No.

1:09:05.811 --> 1:09:08.713
You know what? Okay.

1:09:08.913 --> 1:09:12.222
Sure. I'll see you at home.

1:09:12.389 --> 1:09:14.917
Jake, there's no way
I'm turning down a ride.

1:09:14.952 --> 1:09:16.688
Do you mind, Mrs. T?

1:09:16.723 --> 1:09:19.625
Not at all. Let's
get out of here.

1:09:19.660 --> 1:09:23.464
-Wait, guys, our bikes.
-Leave 'em.

1:09:28.933 --> 1:09:30.570
Thanks, Dad.

1:09:43.288 --> 1:09:43.946
Hey.

1:09:51.527 --> 1:09:55.232
Thank you, Jake,
for everything.

1:10:00.470 --> 1:10:01.997
Okay, let's go home.

1:10:36.671 --> 1:10:38.638
Holy mother...

1:10:50.421 --> 1:10:53.356
You guys wanna do one last
round for old time's sake?

1:10:53.391 --> 1:10:54.753
Trick or treating?

1:10:54.788 --> 1:10:56.854
Nah man, we gotta help
Kate with the party.

1:10:56.889 --> 1:10:58.724
You still coming
though, right?

1:10:58.759 --> 1:11:00.088
Absolutely.

1:11:00.123 --> 1:11:02.827
-Jake, I'm ready.
-Oh my gosh.

1:11:03.830 --> 1:11:06.831
-Have fun, dark princess.
-Better not be late.

1:11:09.539 --> 1:11:12.573
One last thing. Perfect.

1:11:13.576 --> 1:11:14.806
Shall we?

1:11:14.841 --> 1:11:16.074
Have fun, kids.

1:11:16.109 --> 1:11:18.810
Oh, you look great, you
look great. You look so good.

1:11:19.549 --> 1:11:20.416
Hey, hey.

1:11:23.113 --> 1:11:23.980
Thanks.

1:11:25.621 --> 1:11:26.587
I'm real proud of you.

1:11:34.729 --> 1:11:38.093
All right, get going.
Be safe, be safe.

1:11:38.128 --> 1:11:39.028
Have fun!

1:11:41.406 --> 1:11:42.768
Home before dark!

1:12:33.920 --> 1:12:37.790
<i>Vos requiem.</i>

1:12:39.596 --> 1:12:40.496
<i>Ut...</i>

1:12:41.796 --> 1:12:46.634
<i>Vos requiem.</i>

1:12:50.673 --> 1:12:51.540
Rest.

1:12:53.203 --> 1:12:54.037
Rest.

1:12:56.745 --> 1:12:57.579
Rest.
