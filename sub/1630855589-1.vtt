00:49.250 --> 00:52.292
5TH AUGUST 2019
LAHORE, PAKISTAN

00:56.708 --> 00:57.708
What are you looking at?

00:58.458 --> 00:59.417
It's cancer.

01:00.083 --> 01:02.292
Not some pretty girl's Instagram page.

01:04.917 --> 01:06.125
How long have I got?

01:06.750 --> 01:08.833
Three years.
-

01:09.208 --> 01:10.167
Maybe.

01:13.375 --> 01:16.083
The Indian government
has made the shocking decision today

01:16.083 --> 01:18.125
to revoke Kashmir's special status.

01:18.667 --> 01:23.083
The Indian Parliament has unilaterally
announced Article 370 is abrogated.

01:23.833 --> 01:27.458
Pakistan's Foreign Affairs Office has
condemned this unilateral action and said

01:27.625 --> 01:31.750
that Pakistan will weigh up all
options and give a befitting response.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.417
Article 370 canceled!

01:33.708 --> 01:34.750
How can India do that?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.708
-This is wrong, sir.
-

01:36.958 --> 01:38.000
This is not wrong.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.875
It's a declaration of war.

01:42.458 --> 01:43.583
You said three years, right?

01:50.417 --> 01:51.292
It's long enough.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.917
Time for diplomacy has passed, sir.

01:55.625 --> 01:57.167
If we wait for the UN resolution,

01:57.167 --> 02:00.792
then India will take control
of our Azad Kashmir next.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.667
A man of God cannot challenge them.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.083
It's time to befriend the Devil.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.042
-

02:19.167 --> 02:20.125
Jim.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.083
General Qadir for you.

02:23.667 --> 02:25.875
General Qadir, all in order?

02:26.458 --> 02:27.375
Don't want order,

02:27.958 --> 02:28.833
I want chaos.

02:29.542 --> 02:30.500
What do you want?

02:30.833 --> 02:32.417
To bring India to its knees.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.667
You sure?

02:35.167 --> 02:36.417
Once that bullet is fired,

02:37.417 --> 02:39.250
it won't go back into the gun.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.083
You need to be sure.

02:41.667 --> 02:42.542
Can you do it?

02:43.458 --> 02:45.708
It'll take time, but it can be done.

02:52.750 --> 02:55.500
3 YEARS LATER

02:55.958 --> 02:59.042
SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA

02:59.542 --> 03:02.458
-

03:18.500 --> 03:19.708
A radar can't detect it,

03:20.167 --> 03:21.500
no signal can stop it.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.375
It fears nothing,

03:24.125 --> 03:25.750
nor can it be reasoned with.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.792
Once it's launched,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.292
it's like a djinn from Hell.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.875
Countdown to Judgment Day starts.

03:33.833 --> 03:34.792
Good.

03:35.292 --> 03:37.125
Jim will let you know
where to deliver it.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.583
Why? Doesn't he trust you?

03:39.792 --> 03:40.750
Jim?

03:44.083 --> 03:47.125
If God asked him to name
anything he wanted,

03:47.792 --> 03:50.833
he'd say, "Are You playing a trick on me?"

03:51.042 --> 03:51.917
Hmm.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.417
Jim keeps his cards close to his chest.

03:56.292 --> 03:59.083
Boss, is this man Raafe?

03:59.250 --> 04:00.083
Why?

04:00.667 --> 04:01.542
One man come.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.208
He asked for Raafe.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.000
We say don't know Raafe.

04:05.833 --> 04:07.542
He say Raafe come to see Fayyad.

04:07.708 --> 04:08.833
-Where is he?

04:09.417 --> 04:12.375
VIP area, getting special treatment.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.167
-

04:23.083 --> 04:24.583
-

04:51.458 --> 04:53.167
Who are you?

04:53.833 --> 04:55.583
Hey, Hindi.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.417
Speak up!

04:59.000 --> 05:00.708
Talk in Hindi!

05:01.042 --> 05:03.917
No fun swearing at you in Arabic.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.542
You'll take five seconds to be surprised.

05:10.417 --> 05:13.667
Five seconds to wonder
where you've heard this voice.

05:15.625 --> 05:18.167
And five more seconds
to get over your disbelief.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.500
Then you'll ask...

05:25.375 --> 05:28.583
"Pathaan? You?"

05:33.583 --> 05:34.958
Still alive.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.250
Where is she?

05:43.750 --> 05:44.750
How did you survive?

05:44.833 --> 05:47.083
Answer my question first.

05:48.667 --> 05:49.625
Where is Rubai?

05:52.625 --> 05:53.500
Oof!

05:53.875 --> 05:56.208
Mr. Pathaan has a broken heart.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.833
Love and perfume cannot be concealed.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.958
She's far from your reach.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.083
-Now you'll be going far away too.
-Ouch.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.042
Any last message?

06:14.208 --> 06:15.958
I have a gift for her.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.000
-

06:20.958 --> 06:23.875
Your dancing bells are undone, Raafe.
So dance!

06:24.208 --> 06:25.417
-

06:43.292 --> 06:44.208
Kill him!

06:49.333 --> 06:50.583
What are you waiting for?

06:57.208 --> 07:02.583
But there's no one around

07:03.500 --> 07:08.875
And darkness everywhere

07:09.833 --> 07:15.375
But there's no one to dare

07:15.583 --> 07:21.500
And set the order right

07:21.792 --> 07:26.167
Shining so bright

07:29.958 --> 07:31.875
-

07:47.333 --> 07:48.208
Kill him!

08:08.417 --> 08:10.500
-

08:30.083 --> 08:31.792
There's a storm coming, Raafe.

08:32.083 --> 08:33.750
Fasten your seat belt.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.417
-

08:49.500 --> 08:51.042
Close the door!

09:11.417 --> 09:12.583
Sorry, Raafe.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.167
-

09:41.958 --> 09:44.875
YASH RAJ FILMS
PRESENTS

09:47.375 --> 09:52.417
PATHAAN

09:53.000 --> 09:55.625
NEW DELHI, INDIA

09:56.000 --> 09:56.833
J.O.C.R. HEADQUARTERS

09:59.000 --> 10:02.625
-

10:04.042 --> 10:05.042
I'm on my way, Barun.

10:05.625 --> 10:08.417
If you go on about the cake,
how can I finish my work?

10:08.500 --> 10:10.583
Light the candles.
Start singing "Happy Birthday",

10:10.625 --> 10:12.333
and I'll be home
before the candles go out.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.000
Ma'am, I've got
all the information.

10:14.083 --> 10:15.625
-

10:15.708 --> 10:16.750
Yeah. Check again.

10:17.167 --> 10:19.875
I need all the information now.
Run it past the Finance Ministry.

10:19.958 --> 10:21.542
-Uh, ma'am?
-Yes?

10:21.917 --> 10:22.958
We have a red flag.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.542
Our scanner
has just identified someone.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.417
Who is it?
-

10:35.583 --> 10:36.542
Rubai?

10:37.917 --> 10:38.750
Where?

10:38.792 --> 10:39.625
Paris.

10:39.792 --> 10:42.042
A security camera at
Palais Royal metro station.

10:42.292 --> 10:43.250
When?

10:43.375 --> 10:44.375
15 minutes ago, max.

10:45.167 --> 10:46.417
Get a team on it right away.

10:46.583 --> 10:48.292
Keep eyes on her.
Do not intercept.

11:02.292 --> 11:03.208
Get a plane.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.667
Use the blue channel. We need
permission for immediate takeoff.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.250
Yes, ma'am.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.750
And yes, tell Barun...

11:10.792 --> 11:13.208
To keep a slice of cake
for you in the fridge.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.125
How much longer?

11:27.125 --> 11:28.750
Uh, five hours, max.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.500
Uh... ma'am?

11:33.000 --> 11:33.875
Hmm?

11:35.042 --> 11:37.667
Ma'am, are we going after Pathaan?

11:42.917 --> 11:44.542
What do you know about Pathaan?

11:46.250 --> 11:47.167
Not much, ma'am.

11:48.125 --> 11:52.625
Whenever he's mentioned,
everyone gets uncomfortable.

11:53.833 --> 11:54.875
They change the subject.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.792
Ma'am... is he on our side?

12:00.625 --> 12:02.333
He was once.

12:03.625 --> 12:04.500
Not just on our side,

12:05.625 --> 12:07.333
he was our center-forward.

12:08.625 --> 12:11.333
Opening batsman, opening bowler...

12:12.333 --> 12:14.250
wicketkeeper and four slip fielder too.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.208
You know, if it weren't for Pathaan...

12:19.875 --> 12:22.250
we would not be doing what we do.

12:23.542 --> 12:25.542
Nor would the JOCR Department exist.

12:27.292 --> 12:29.792
Two years ago,
during a Myanmar mission,

12:30.167 --> 12:31.875
Pathaan got badly injured.

12:32.750 --> 12:36.542
He lay in a hospital for weeks.
It was touch and go.

12:38.458 --> 12:41.625
Everyone believed
the Pathaan chapter was closed.

12:43.292 --> 12:45.083
We didn't realize that...

12:46.458 --> 12:48.458
he was writing a whole new book.

12:50.625 --> 12:53.250
INDIAN MILITARY HOSPITAL, NEW DELHI
2 YEARS EARLIER

13:07.583 --> 13:09.250
I heard you got badly hurt.

13:09.917 --> 13:10.750
Ma'am...

13:11.625 --> 13:12.542
yes.

13:12.833 --> 13:13.875
I have a metal plate in my foot,

13:15.000 --> 13:16.333
a titanium disc in my neck,

13:16.708 --> 13:18.667
and bio-absorbable screws in my shoulder.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.125
But you look very well.

13:23.542 --> 13:26.958
It's tough. My body goes
beep, beep, beep at airport security.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.667
Looks like retirement doesn't suit you.

13:32.042 --> 13:33.083
-Why?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.000
Retirement can be peaceful, Pathaan.

13:36.667 --> 13:40.458
There are so many ways
to spend one's time.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.875
Tomorrow we could be a MasterChef
and Indian Idol the next day.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.167
You need to
get a hobby, Pathaan.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.000
Found it.

13:51.208 --> 13:52.125
Kintsugi.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.000
Is that Punjabi?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.875
Japanese.
And I know you know what it means.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.708
I know.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.542
If precious pottery breaks,

14:04.083 --> 14:06.542
the Japanese put the broken pieces
together with molten gold.

14:07.458 --> 14:10.125
The object looks stronger
and more beautiful.

14:10.167 --> 14:12.917
It's even considered more valuable.

14:14.042 --> 14:15.958
Ma'am, look at this file.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.875
These are the broken pieces
of our organization.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.583
-They're soldiers like me.

14:20.917 --> 14:24.250
Forced to retire
because of injury or trauma.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.417
But they're not done yet.

14:26.917 --> 14:29.500
They're still full of guts and passion.

14:30.167 --> 14:33.667
They're ready to fight and die for India.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.458
So what do you want?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.875
To form a new unit?

14:38.375 --> 14:39.292
Yes, ma'am.

14:39.417 --> 14:42.250
Do you realize how many people
will need convincing?

14:43.083 --> 14:45.208
There will be so much red tape,
your hands will get glued together.

14:46.292 --> 14:47.125
Try it.

14:47.375 --> 14:51.000
You think
I've just been growing my hair out?

14:51.458 --> 14:53.833
I've tried it.
And better, I've done it.

14:59.625 --> 15:02.833
J.O.C.R.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.000
JOCR?

15:06.000 --> 15:08.083
Joint Operations and Covert Research,
ma'am.

15:10.458 --> 15:11.792
Giving me a new job?

15:12.667 --> 15:13.583
No, ma'am.

15:15.875 --> 15:19.375
Just returning my boss her chair.

15:20.750 --> 15:22.250
You were looking for a new hobby.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
Try Kintsugi, please.

15:26.458 --> 15:31.375
These broken soldiers
need new meaning in their lives.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.333
They're ready for a mission.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.875
You are the molten gold
who can put them together.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.583
Stronger than before...

15:42.292 --> 15:43.958
and more dangerous.

15:47.167 --> 15:49.125
-

15:58.292 --> 16:00.375
That was the birth of Team JOCR.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.542
Every important mission for India

16:04.083 --> 16:08.625
that no one else could carry out,
or take the responsibility for...

16:09.833 --> 16:11.250
that was our playground.

16:11.500 --> 16:13.208
We had no rules to stop us.

16:13.583 --> 16:15.458
So obviously
anyone who loved rules...

16:16.833 --> 16:21.208
had a problem with us.
Like our Colonel Luthra.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.500
Wow!

16:23.083 --> 16:24.042
Beautiful!

16:25.083 --> 16:26.083
Very beautiful!

16:27.333 --> 16:31.833
This space was reserved for a recreational
club for us and other departments.

16:32.375 --> 16:35.167
A gym, sauna, pool tables, etc.

16:35.208 --> 16:36.833
Sauna? Pool tables?

16:37.375 --> 16:39.167
Excuse me, sir,
you can't be serious.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.125
These people are my officers.
- They're not officers!

16:42.458 --> 16:45.875
You've made JOCR
with some broken jokers!

16:46.542 --> 16:49.083
They're just broken eggshells.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.708
How dare you!
-

16:55.542 --> 16:56.750
Good invention, guys.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.958
-Rishi, well done!
-Thank you, sir.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.500
Did you think I actually...
-No, ma'am.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.833
Oh, come on, Pathaan!
I was just playing along.

17:07.167 --> 17:09.375
Would I talk
to a superior like that?

17:09.708 --> 17:10.625
No, never.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.000
Don't be a child.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.458
I admit
Rishi's invention is very real.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.792
But, Pathaan,
you can't mess with me.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.625
Is this a bad time?
- No, sir.

17:20.958 --> 17:21.875
Oh!

17:23.375 --> 17:25.375
He looks a little pale.

17:26.375 --> 17:29.667
And he has those bags
under his eyes, which you guys missed.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.125
Have you seen
Luthra's double chin?

17:32.750 --> 17:35.208
It hangs down to his belly.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.250
And Luthra's paunch?

17:39.875 --> 17:40.792
Sir!

17:41.083 --> 17:42.000
Very good!

17:42.875 --> 17:44.333
Very serious department!

17:44.667 --> 17:47.292
Now I can make recommendations
to the Defense Secretary.

17:48.125 --> 17:53.167
I told you that you're broken eggshells.
That's all.

17:54.125 --> 17:55.208
Paunch, ma'am!

17:55.875 --> 17:56.833
Sir. Sir.

17:57.333 --> 17:59.458
Sir, now that you're here,
wait two minutes, please.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.292
I must show you something.

18:02.833 --> 18:05.917
Aeroflot 394C, 144 casualties.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.667
Daesh claimed it was their doing.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.125
Norwegian ship, Asgard.

18:10.333 --> 18:12.250
Pirates destroyed it in the Gulf of Aden.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.250
Biggest ecological
disaster of the decade.

18:14.750 --> 18:15.833
Courtesy Boko Haram.

18:16.500 --> 18:17.792
Chemical attack on the Japanese--

18:17.833 --> 18:21.125
The Japanese outfit Aleph
claimed responsibility.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.958
You think I have no intel on all this?

18:25.083 --> 18:25.958
No, sir.

18:26.042 --> 18:27.000
It wasn't Aleph...

18:27.917 --> 18:29.292
or Boko Haram or Daesh.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.750
At least, they weren't directly involved.

18:31.958 --> 18:36.250
They outsourced these attacks
to a private terrorist group.

18:36.333 --> 18:39.333
They work on contract,
not for ideological reasons.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
Really?

18:41.458 --> 18:43.542
Terrorists are corporations now?

18:44.833 --> 18:47.000
Let's say a group like this exists,
so what?

18:47.583 --> 18:49.833
They're Interpol's problem, not India's.

18:49.917 --> 18:52.542
Actually, sir, now it is.

18:54.208 --> 18:56.917
Because their next episode
is an India special.

18:57.750 --> 18:59.375
And this is a big one.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.208
In Dubai.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.875
Sir, through the darknet,
we found out that

19:04.917 --> 19:08.000
Outfit X is planning
something big in Dubai.

19:08.583 --> 19:10.500
At the Asian Scientific Conference,

19:10.750 --> 19:13.667
two Indian scientists
will represent India and our--

19:13.750 --> 19:17.042
At the conference, our President...

19:18.292 --> 19:19.708
is giving the keynote address.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.458
They're after the President.

19:25.875 --> 19:26.917
We think so, sir.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.542
I'll make sure the security is tripled.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.625
They won't
get near the President.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.167
Thank you, sir.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.333
-Thank you.
- Another request, sir.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.458
If you don't mind...

19:39.458 --> 19:40.333
these...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.500
eggshells will come with me to Dubai.

19:44.125 --> 19:45.125
Trust me, Luthra.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.292
You look after
the President's security,

19:47.875 --> 19:49.583
we'll handle Outfit X.

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
DUBAI, UAE

19:57.167 --> 19:58.917
We took no chances, Pathaan.

19:59.042 --> 20:01.750
Frankly speaking, your intel is paranoia.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.500
I changed the President's
travel itinerary at the last minute.

20:04.583 --> 20:06.458
- No sign of explosives.

20:06.583 --> 20:09.833
There are no spots
for a sniper to hide.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.917
Absolutely nothing suspicious.

20:12.250 --> 20:13.417
Intel was real, sir.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.750
But now there's radio silence.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.875
They've either become more careful or...

20:20.958 --> 20:23.667
Sir, you said you changed
the President's travel route.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.583
What was it before?

20:24.625 --> 20:28.375
He was to travel with
the two scientists and the press.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.750
Showing support for science.

20:29.833 --> 20:32.875
Now he's taking
another route. With full security.

20:32.958 --> 20:35.833
What about our scientists?
Will they travel with the President?

20:35.917 --> 20:38.500
No. Multiple vehicles
make security tricky.

20:38.583 --> 20:41.583
I want our NSG commandos
to focus on the President.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.958
So the two scientists who had NSG cover,

20:45.458 --> 20:47.042
no longer have it.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.042
Damn it!

20:49.375 --> 20:52.042
They tricked us
into changing the travel itinerary.

20:53.042 --> 20:54.750
Their target is not the President, sir.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.333
-

20:59.250 --> 21:02.208
I was hoping to take a selfie
with the President,

21:02.583 --> 21:04.333
and impress the missus!

21:04.958 --> 21:07.417
You still want to impress her,
after thirty years?

21:08.167 --> 21:09.917
Science is easy, Farooqui.

21:10.583 --> 21:11.625
Love is hard.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.417
PATRIOT

21:50.625 --> 21:53.000
-

21:59.750 --> 22:01.000
Sir, we've been attacked!

22:05.208 --> 22:06.667
You were right, Pathaan.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.917
They've attacked the scientists' convoy.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.458
Shweta, lock me to the scientists' phone.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.417
On it, sir.
- Now!

22:16.333 --> 22:17.917
Wait. Don't shoot!

22:22.625 --> 22:24.542
Dr. Sahani, Dr. Farooqui.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.833
Take my advice.
Be more scared than you are.

22:27.667 --> 22:28.667
You're pretty screwed.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.750
He's got the scientists
in a gray Hummer, Pathaan.

22:37.917 --> 22:39.708
Sir, I've sent you
the Hummer's location.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.167
-

22:56.083 --> 22:57.250
There's the Hummer, sir!

24:21.000 --> 24:25.292
Pathaan, I've been waiting
for a long time to meet you.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.917
I heard a lot about you
when I was in RAW.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.042
They call me Jim.

24:32.583 --> 24:33.458
Jim?

24:33.792 --> 24:35.583
You probably heard I was dead.

24:36.625 --> 24:37.542
So?

24:40.458 --> 24:43.000
Well, I am actually dead for India.

24:44.917 --> 24:46.042
Here's the proof.

24:47.875 --> 24:49.167
Bravery award.

24:52.000 --> 24:53.375
I died a bloody hero.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.208
How come, Jim?

24:58.958 --> 25:00.833
I heard you--
-Were the best?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.667
You heard right. I still am.

25:05.167 --> 25:06.500
She broke my heart.

25:07.667 --> 25:08.792
She'll break yours too.

25:10.500 --> 25:11.750
You know her.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.083
The difference is
I considered myself her lover,

25:16.583 --> 25:18.833
and you think you're her son.

25:21.667 --> 25:22.667
Mother India!

25:25.792 --> 25:26.667
You're lucky.

25:27.667 --> 25:30.667
You'll die believing your patriotism
meant something.

25:31.833 --> 25:34.292
I'm sure they'll throw a medal
for bravery on your grave.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.167
They'll call you a martyr.

25:37.292 --> 25:38.542
But cost to the country?

25:40.250 --> 25:41.167
Zero.

25:43.833 --> 25:46.000
If life was different,
perhaps we'd be friends.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.167
What a pity!

25:50.708 --> 25:53.250
We have to play the cards we're dealt.

25:54.750 --> 25:57.000
And in this round,
I hold all the aces.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.250
Raza! Rishi!

26:11.583 --> 26:12.958
-Rishi...
-

26:13.042 --> 26:14.333
-

26:14.417 --> 26:15.708
My seat belt.
- I'm stuck!

26:15.917 --> 26:18.083
-Pathaan, I'm stuck!
-I can't unfasten my seat belt!

26:19.917 --> 26:21.583
Rishi!
-

26:26.125 --> 26:27.458
Yeah! Come on.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.875
-

26:33.958 --> 26:36.000
I can't! My legs are stuck!
- Come on!

26:38.417 --> 26:39.625
My leg is stuck, sir.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.125
-Rishi.
-

26:41.542 --> 26:42.833
-My leg!
-Don't worry, Rishi.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.375
My leg! I can't...
- Pathaan!

26:44.458 --> 26:45.792
Sir, my leg is stuck.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.542
-We must go, Pathaan!
-Wait!

26:47.625 --> 26:49.375
-Raza! Wait!
-The car is about to explode!

26:49.500 --> 26:51.750
-Raza, take him away!
-There's nothing you can do.

26:51.833 --> 26:53.458
Pathaan, we must go.
- Go, sir.

26:53.542 --> 26:56.000
There's nothing we can do!
- Sir, it's been an honor.

26:56.083 --> 26:57.458
We must go, Pathaan!

26:58.042 --> 26:59.958
Pathaan!

27:00.042 --> 27:02.000
Jai Hind!
-

28:05.250 --> 28:07.333
-

28:49.958 --> 28:50.917
Block the road.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.708
These choppers
won't fly through the tunnel,

30:25.125 --> 30:26.917
they'll crash into the building.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.458
Well, Pathaan? What next?

30:30.625 --> 30:32.292
Their lives hang by this rope.

30:32.667 --> 30:34.375
Only you can untie the knot.

30:35.708 --> 30:37.125
So, what's it gonna be, buddy?

30:37.583 --> 30:39.792
Sacrifice? Or common sense?

30:48.208 --> 30:49.667
Say hello to Mother India!

30:49.958 --> 30:51.417
Tell her I'm coming soon.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.250
I have a score to settle.

31:19.125 --> 31:22.083
Can't trust dead men
to stay dead.

31:23.083 --> 31:24.167
Was Jim working for RAW?

31:25.833 --> 31:28.125
-Jim and Kabir.
-

31:28.750 --> 31:30.208
Our best agents.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.833
They were quite similar.

31:34.792 --> 31:37.625
Calculative, precise, methodical.

31:39.542 --> 31:41.000
Not like our Mr. Pathaan.

31:41.792 --> 31:45.625
He first listens to his heart,
then to his superiors.

31:46.625 --> 31:47.750
So, what went wrong?

31:48.208 --> 31:49.125
A job.

31:49.750 --> 31:53.583
Remember the ONGC drilling
team the Somalian pirates kidnapped?

31:53.667 --> 31:54.875
-Hmm.

31:55.125 --> 31:56.625
Jim went in solo.

31:57.292 --> 32:01.708
He managed to save
six hostages, totally unharmed.

32:03.583 --> 32:05.417
The pirates swore to take revenge.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.250
They finally tracked Jim down.

32:10.000 --> 32:13.167
They asked for a ransom of ten crore
rupees in exchange for Jim and his wife.

32:13.708 --> 32:16.625
But we don't negotiate with terrorists.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.583
You love your country too much.

32:24.958 --> 32:26.083
But your country...

32:27.667 --> 32:28.667
no love you.

32:38.500 --> 32:39.375
No!

32:40.125 --> 32:41.667
No!

32:43.458 --> 32:44.500
No! No!

32:45.000 --> 32:46.083
No!

32:46.917 --> 32:47.792
No.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.083
No!

32:53.667 --> 32:57.333
No! Please leave her!

32:58.625 --> 32:59.583
No!

33:00.292 --> 33:01.125
No!

33:01.917 --> 33:03.958
-

33:04.917 --> 33:07.417
- No!

33:07.792 --> 33:08.875
No!

33:12.667 --> 33:14.375
No!

33:15.000 --> 33:18.083
No!

33:19.917 --> 33:21.625
We never found Jim's body.

33:22.083 --> 33:23.458
So we assumed he was dead.

33:24.042 --> 33:25.708
Jim was given a medal,
the bravery award.

33:26.583 --> 33:28.333
One of his uncles received it.

33:28.958 --> 33:33.708
Couldn't you have paid the ransom for
an agent like him and his family?

33:36.333 --> 33:38.875
Your department does not
lack funds, sir.

33:39.292 --> 33:41.458
Our funds can't be wasted
on personal matters, Pathaan.

33:42.833 --> 33:44.250
Such honesty, sir!

33:45.583 --> 33:47.542
What if it was a minister's family?

33:47.917 --> 33:50.292
Only the weak go down
on their knees, Pathaan.

33:51.875 --> 33:52.792
Not soldiers.

33:53.208 --> 33:56.458
Now this soldier will have us
on our knees.

33:57.042 --> 33:57.875
Colonel...

33:59.917 --> 34:01.417
I have looked into his eyes.

34:03.833 --> 34:06.917
He's beyond right and wrong,
good and bad.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.792
Your decision has convinced him
that his actions are justified.

34:14.625 --> 34:15.500
And now...

34:16.125 --> 34:18.750
he will not stop.

34:32.042 --> 34:33.500
Shweta, check for leads on the darknet.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.708
-Raktbeej.
- What's that?

34:36.833 --> 34:38.792
The word keeps popping up.

34:38.958 --> 34:42.542
-Raktbeej. Sounds like a code word.
-For a man? Or an object?

34:42.625 --> 34:43.500
Mm-hmm.

34:43.917 --> 34:45.292
Have the dead in Dubai been identified?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.875
Yes, sir.
All ex-soldiers or secret agents.

34:48.042 --> 34:50.458
They recently received money transfers.

34:50.833 --> 34:51.750
From one account?

34:51.917 --> 34:55.083
Yes. From a Pakistani doctor.
Rubina Mohsin.

34:57.917 --> 34:59.000
She lives in London.

34:59.083 --> 35:02.792
Her account was inactive for months.
Then these transfers were made.

35:03.042 --> 35:04.583
Who knows if she was even aware.

35:05.000 --> 35:07.875
The bank would've alerted her
about the transfers.

35:08.292 --> 35:10.583
We've hacked her emails.
She hasn't logged in for a month.

35:10.750 --> 35:12.000
Her phone is off too.

35:12.042 --> 35:14.375
But two hours ago,
she checked in online.

35:14.875 --> 35:15.917
She's taking a flight.

35:16.875 --> 35:17.833
Where to?

35:18.583 --> 35:20.875
If it was another agent,
she'd be off to Iraq or Syria.

35:21.625 --> 35:22.667
As it's you...

35:23.583 --> 35:24.500
it's Spain.

35:24.792 --> 35:25.708
Mm-hmm.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.542
I'm desperate for a vacation.

37:46.083 --> 37:49.167
Shweta, I'm sending you info
on Dr. Rubina Mohsin. Check it.

38:31.708 --> 38:35.792
When I feel
A wave of modesty

41:18.625 --> 41:19.583
Cool, no?

41:20.667 --> 41:23.792
Throw a few seeds on the ground
and the ants come crawling.

41:24.375 --> 41:26.542
A bank account, a SIM card...

41:27.500 --> 41:30.042
and Pathaan appears
in flesh and blood.

41:31.125 --> 41:32.125
The hunter...

41:34.833 --> 41:35.708
hunted!

41:40.667 --> 41:41.958
Meet my team, Pathaan.

41:43.167 --> 41:45.625
Raafe, ex-GID.

41:46.250 --> 41:48.375
Sergei, ex-SBU.

41:48.917 --> 41:50.958
Begio, ex-AISE.

41:51.375 --> 41:53.458
Dietrich, ex-BDD.

41:55.125 --> 41:58.250
-And Rubai, ex-ISI.
-Hmm.

41:58.375 --> 41:59.292
Nice.

42:00.583 --> 42:03.458
The world's top-secret agencies
are all represented here.

42:05.917 --> 42:07.125
Only India is missing.

42:10.167 --> 42:11.125
Will you oblige?

42:17.333 --> 42:18.292
Are you for real?

42:18.792 --> 42:20.833
Actually, I came here
to offer you a position

42:22.083 --> 42:23.958
in a six feet hole I've dug for you.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.417
There's room to lie down too.

42:27.458 --> 42:29.458
Will you come half naked like this?

42:30.708 --> 42:32.125
Or must I drag you out?

42:34.083 --> 42:36.458
I already have a grave
with my name on it, Pathaan.

42:37.542 --> 42:38.708
You do too.

42:40.167 --> 42:41.458
Since the day you became a soldier.

42:43.167 --> 42:45.750
That's all that Mother India offers.

42:47.250 --> 42:48.833
A never-ending supply of coffins.

42:49.792 --> 42:52.458
Only the names of the corpses change.

42:54.875 --> 42:56.125
See, Pathaan.

42:56.667 --> 42:59.542
We're not answerable
to anyone. Family, foe or friend.

43:01.750 --> 43:03.333
We choose the jobs we want.

43:03.833 --> 43:05.000
And demand the price we want.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.375
Join us, Pathaan.

43:07.917 --> 43:08.875
Be rich.

43:09.792 --> 43:10.875
Be powerful.

43:15.458 --> 43:16.500
Or be a corpse.

43:18.167 --> 43:19.125
Simple.

43:20.542 --> 43:22.042
Shall I cuss you in English?

43:22.375 --> 43:24.708
Or explain in Hindi?

43:28.292 --> 43:29.292
Pay up, guys.

43:30.208 --> 43:31.875
I wagered
you'd refuse my offer.

43:35.125 --> 43:37.042
Even your death wins me a bet.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.292
-Sorry, Pathaan.
-

43:40.375 --> 43:44.250
If you're not on my side, I can't
afford to let you be against me.

44:16.042 --> 44:17.000
Sorry, Pathaan.

44:19.750 --> 44:20.708
Nothing personal.

44:20.875 --> 44:22.042
- Really?

44:29.833 --> 44:30.708
Ow!

44:36.042 --> 44:36.875
-

44:36.917 --> 44:38.542
-Ooh!
-

44:48.583 --> 44:49.500
Women!

45:05.750 --> 45:06.708
Yours, ma'am.

45:14.708 --> 45:16.208
-

45:16.583 --> 45:17.833
-Let's go.
-Of course.

45:22.417 --> 45:23.333
Oh!

45:24.167 --> 45:26.583
- Are you ex-ISI?

45:27.083 --> 45:28.000
Not ex.

45:28.333 --> 45:31.125
You thought you were the only ones
monitoring Outfit X?

45:33.042 --> 45:35.042
I've been with them for a year,
undercover.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.708
-Why all this?
-

45:39.458 --> 45:42.083
With you, we'll get what I want faster.

45:42.917 --> 45:45.333
When did we become a "we"?

45:46.292 --> 45:47.667
When I saved your life.

45:48.167 --> 45:49.750
You endangered it!

45:51.542 --> 45:53.417
You know that, right?

45:53.708 --> 45:54.542
You...

45:54.583 --> 45:55.542
Run!
- Where are you?

45:56.917 --> 45:57.875
Where are you going?

45:58.333 --> 45:59.250
-Wait!
- Duck.

46:00.542 --> 46:01.458
Good shot.

46:01.542 --> 46:03.333
-

46:09.917 --> 46:10.792
Oh!

46:10.958 --> 46:12.500
You aim well.

46:13.500 --> 46:14.500
So do they.

46:15.625 --> 46:18.125
-

46:59.292 --> 47:00.542
Father!

47:02.417 --> 47:03.333
Father!

47:06.833 --> 47:07.792
Morning.

47:09.167 --> 47:10.708
You were out for 18 hours.

47:11.250 --> 47:13.042
- Take it easy.

47:14.667 --> 47:15.625
Fever's down.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.417
No infection. And luckily the bullet
didn't touch any vital organ.

47:19.167 --> 47:20.750
You were calling for your father
and crying.

47:21.292 --> 47:23.583
You kept asking them
to let your father go.

47:25.208 --> 47:26.167
Father...

47:27.417 --> 47:29.042
He was a journalist in the Middle East.

47:30.583 --> 47:32.333
He asked too many questions.

47:33.333 --> 47:35.000
Printed too many answers.

47:35.500 --> 47:36.750
So he was brutally tortured...

47:37.417 --> 47:40.333
and we were made to watch
from the front row.

47:40.750 --> 47:44.458
Then you went to Pakistan with
your mother and joined medical college.

47:45.000 --> 47:46.500
Dr. Rubina Mohsin.

47:52.208 --> 47:54.167
After that, to serve humanity...

47:55.917 --> 47:57.083
you joined the ISI.

48:02.083 --> 48:03.000
Hmm.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.708
Oh! Of course.
-

48:10.875 --> 48:11.792
Cheers.

48:22.458 --> 48:23.917
Couldn't you
find a cheaper drink?

48:25.208 --> 48:28.250
Thing is, we don't
have big budgets like the ISI.

48:29.292 --> 48:30.167
But seriously...

48:31.375 --> 48:32.542
why did you save my life?

48:34.333 --> 48:36.458
Aren't your good looks
and personality enough?

48:37.167 --> 48:39.708
Normally they are. I'm so sexy.

48:40.417 --> 48:43.750
You said we'd get what
you wanted faster with me.

48:44.042 --> 48:44.917
Hmm.

48:45.500 --> 48:49.250
So I want to know,
what do "we" want?

48:50.792 --> 48:51.750
Raktbeej.

48:53.125 --> 48:54.083
Heard the name?

48:54.958 --> 48:57.375
Hmm. He was a demon.

48:58.167 --> 49:00.125
Wherever a drop of his blood fell,

49:00.333 --> 49:02.000
another Raktbeej was born.

49:02.750 --> 49:05.542
Basically, it was impossible
to destroy Raktbeej.

49:10.417 --> 49:12.083
Whatever this Raktbeej is,
it's in Russia.

49:13.542 --> 49:14.542
In seven days...

49:15.708 --> 49:16.667
In seven days...

49:18.208 --> 49:19.083
what?

49:20.292 --> 49:22.625
Jim will take delivery
of Raktbeej in seven days.

49:22.667 --> 49:23.542
Hmm.

49:23.792 --> 49:25.583
Then all hell will break loose.

49:27.708 --> 49:30.667
-So basically, we have...
-Seven days. Got it.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.375
Cheers.

49:32.875 --> 49:33.917
Bottoms up!

49:35.792 --> 49:39.625
I think you skipped school
the day they spoke about ISI and India.

49:40.792 --> 49:43.542
You see we don't get on so well.

49:45.875 --> 49:51.958
Besides, the first day we met, you put
Jim's gun against my head. Remember?

49:52.875 --> 49:54.167
So don't take it personally...

49:55.042 --> 49:56.750
if I have a few trust issues.

49:57.542 --> 49:59.917
Some things are
more important than trust issues.

49:59.958 --> 50:03.458
Like these seven days and Raktbeej.

50:05.458 --> 50:06.333
So are you in?

50:07.333 --> 50:08.167
Or are you out?

50:08.875 --> 50:09.708
Hmm...

50:11.708 --> 50:12.792
So am I in?

50:14.417 --> 50:15.667
Or am I out?

50:18.958 --> 50:20.458
Russia's a big place.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.083
Do you know the address?

50:23.000 --> 50:24.042
Any landmark?

50:24.083 --> 50:25.333
You know? Something.

50:26.500 --> 50:29.000
Vault 412, Moscow,

50:30.042 --> 50:31.000
Woskwich Tower.

50:31.708 --> 50:33.125
You must know the address.

50:34.042 --> 50:35.958
You were posted in Russia
for three years.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.417
Oh!

50:38.000 --> 50:39.667
What else
do you know about me?

50:40.667 --> 50:41.833
Do you want me to tell you
everything now?

50:42.375 --> 50:43.458
Scary.

50:43.625 --> 50:47.083
An ISI agent tells us there's something
in Moscow that Jim's after.

50:47.375 --> 50:48.292
Yes, ma'am.

50:48.833 --> 50:51.167
I've heard
about Raktbeej on the darknet.

50:52.042 --> 50:53.167
Do you know what it is?

50:56.208 --> 50:57.042
No, ma'am.

50:57.083 --> 51:00.333
So, let's hope wherever it is,
it stays unknown.

51:00.667 --> 51:03.083
I know you're familiar
with every corner of Russia.

51:03.625 --> 51:06.667
But Russia is still
a friendly country and a crucial ally.

51:07.542 --> 51:11.083
A scandal will not be
tolerated in Moscow or in Delhi.

51:11.625 --> 51:13.458
Ma'am, you know
Jim wants Raktbeej.

51:14.042 --> 51:16.042
If he can't buy it, he'll steal it.

51:17.000 --> 51:19.042
-And if you get caught?
-

51:19.542 --> 51:21.292
Don't try negotiating for me.

51:23.292 --> 51:24.167
I'm not Jim.

51:26.042 --> 51:27.000
Damn it!

51:28.583 --> 51:30.458
Whatever Raktbeej is...

51:31.292 --> 51:35.167
neither Jim nor ISI should
get their hands on it.

51:35.458 --> 51:36.500
Go, get it!

51:37.667 --> 51:38.625
Love you, ma'am.

51:39.542 --> 51:42.250
MOSCOW, RUSSIA

51:42.583 --> 51:43.667
Welcome.

51:43.792 --> 51:45.375
Sir, let me show you around.

51:45.708 --> 51:47.542
Hmm. Same to you.

51:49.625 --> 51:51.917
-For an English dictionary.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

51:52.125 --> 51:53.917
You need anything, contact Andrei.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.000
You have a great honeymoon.

51:58.625 --> 52:00.458
You didn't tell me
we were on our honeymoon.

52:00.958 --> 52:03.792
If you had denied it, it would've
broken Andrei's heart.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.083
Look. What a stunning view!

52:12.208 --> 52:13.042
Wow!

52:13.708 --> 52:17.958
I never thought I'd see such a big
building on my wedding night!

52:18.250 --> 52:20.000
If you stay with me,
there's more fun to come.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.333
Many corporates have their offices
in that building.

52:23.417 --> 52:24.250
WOSKWICH TOWER

52:24.292 --> 52:25.792
This is the Woskwich Tower.

52:25.875 --> 52:29.333
The 92nd floor is home to
the world's most secure vault.

52:29.417 --> 52:30.250
92ND FLOOR -SECURED VAULT

52:30.750 --> 52:33.292
The vault is a 30ft x 30ft room.

52:33.375 --> 52:37.000
No key or explosive can open it.

52:37.292 --> 52:40.917
No laser can cut through.
No acid burn through.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.917
Can't cut it, can't break it.
Can't blow it up, can't burn it.

52:45.667 --> 52:46.667
But we can open it!

52:47.500 --> 52:49.958
But... there's only one problem.

52:50.583 --> 52:54.833
The vault has a lock and key
but two different people have them.

52:54.917 --> 52:55.875
So when you need to open it,

52:56.417 --> 52:58.750
an uncle brings the lock from his home,

52:59.208 --> 53:00.708
and an aunty brings the key.

53:01.208 --> 53:05.333
The lock and key meet like the union
of the Ganges and Jamuna.

53:05.375 --> 53:06.958
-Access granted.
-

53:12.542 --> 53:15.083
So, must we steal
both lock and key?

53:15.208 --> 53:16.583
Yes, exactly.

53:16.875 --> 53:18.750
But there's a complication.

53:18.958 --> 53:23.167
The lock is 12 kms away
in Uncle Grigor's office.

53:23.208 --> 53:24.000
GRIGOR UNCLE -12 KMS

53:24.042 --> 53:28.042
And the key is 16 kms away
with Aunty Karen.

53:28.125 --> 53:28.958
KAREN AUNTY -16 KMS

53:29.000 --> 53:32.583
And of course, their offices
are in opposite directions.

53:32.667 --> 53:33.667
And the best part?

53:33.917 --> 53:36.792
We must get to the vault
in ten minutes once we've stolen them.

53:36.833 --> 53:37.667
10 MIN

53:37.708 --> 53:38.750
Say what?
- What?

53:39.500 --> 53:40.708
I love this sugar-free yogurt.

53:41.792 --> 53:44.083
As soon as
the lock and key are removed,

53:44.375 --> 53:46.583
a timer starts ticking.

53:47.000 --> 53:50.708
Within ten minutes, at FSB headquarters,
someone must enter an "all-clear code".

53:51.125 --> 53:54.208
This confirms all is well,
and it's not Rubai and Pathaan.

53:54.875 --> 53:55.750
Or else...

53:56.292 --> 53:57.125
Or else?

54:02.125 --> 54:03.542
Total lockdown. That's it.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.958
Lock, key or prayers,
nothing makes a difference.

54:07.708 --> 54:11.083
Unless the system
is reset in three places.

54:13.292 --> 54:14.208
Game over.

54:14.417 --> 54:17.458
How can we reach the vault
in ten minutes in Moscow traffic?

54:17.542 --> 54:18.917
Mm-hmm. Step one.

54:19.042 --> 54:22.375
To get to the main lock,
we must first open another lock.

54:22.500 --> 54:25.792
To open that, we need
Uncle Grigor's fingerprints.

54:25.875 --> 54:28.208
-

55:40.208 --> 55:41.500
Any cops in sight?

55:42.083 --> 55:42.917
Why?

55:43.750 --> 55:46.625
Because you're looking like a bomb!

55:50.000 --> 55:50.875
Oh!

55:56.750 --> 55:57.792
Ooh!

55:59.583 --> 56:00.458
Have a blast.

56:00.792 --> 56:01.833
Oh, I will.

56:11.250 --> 56:12.250
Boom!

56:14.167 --> 56:15.083
Step two.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.292
Our key-holding Aunty Karen.

56:17.417 --> 56:18.917
You'll seduce her?
-

56:19.250 --> 56:20.208
I wish!

56:20.458 --> 56:21.875
I'm not her type.

56:22.708 --> 56:26.292
She'll be knocked out
by some sleeping pills.

56:51.750 --> 56:54.167
Good night, K-K-K-Karen.

56:58.375 --> 56:59.292
Step three.

56:59.458 --> 57:02.250
We need two planes. And two pilots.

57:02.583 --> 57:04.125
Absolute professionals.

57:04.292 --> 57:06.083
-

57:06.208 --> 57:07.292
You picked this place?

57:07.708 --> 57:09.625
No. Our pilots did.

57:10.542 --> 57:12.542
Pilots? Right.
-Hmm.

57:14.042 --> 57:14.958
They're late.

57:15.333 --> 57:16.208
Very professional.

57:16.667 --> 57:20.917
Uh, actually, flying is just their hobby.

57:21.417 --> 57:23.583
Professionally, they're singers.

57:26.417 --> 57:27.250
Singers?

57:28.083 --> 57:29.000
Singers.

57:41.417 --> 57:43.375
Hey! What about the bill?

57:43.625 --> 57:45.333
Rubai, listen.
You'll have some cheese?

57:48.667 --> 57:50.042
Now for step four.

57:50.167 --> 57:51.667
- What step is this?

57:51.917 --> 57:53.625
Never mind. It's fun.

57:54.833 --> 57:58.708
Are you and the, uh, missus
looking for anything in particular?

57:59.958 --> 58:01.375
Very particular.

58:03.083 --> 58:04.958
How would you like
to earn 20,000 boobles?

58:06.750 --> 58:07.667
Rubles!

58:09.542 --> 58:10.500
What did I say?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.042
I meant rubles.

58:23.583 --> 58:25.708
Let's sleep early.
Tomorrow's a big day.

58:26.125 --> 58:29.417
We have a meeting with Raktbeej.
Our final step.

58:40.875 --> 58:41.750
Uh...

58:45.167 --> 58:50.417
Uh, I think you're taking this
honeymoon suite too seriously.

58:51.208 --> 58:52.958
Tomorrow we have
an appointment with Raktbeej.

58:52.958 --> 58:55.417
So, you know, get some rest.

58:56.875 --> 58:59.583
This may be our last night
outside a Russian jail. So...

59:02.167 --> 59:04.000
Then we shouldn't waste it.

59:04.625 --> 59:06.417
Yeah! Waste is not good.

59:07.500 --> 59:08.958
Maybe I...

59:09.083 --> 59:10.750
Could you help with my bandages?

59:11.250 --> 59:12.750
Yeah-- Bandages? Of course.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.958
Nothing better I'd like to do
than change your bandages.

59:19.458 --> 59:20.375
Pathaan.

59:22.083 --> 59:23.292
I mean, you're actually a Pathaan?

59:25.125 --> 59:26.083
Are you a Muslim?

59:28.708 --> 59:31.458
Rubai, I don't know what I am.
Who I am.

59:32.625 --> 59:33.875
Or who my parents were.

59:36.750 --> 59:39.000
Or why I was abandoned
in front of a cinema.

59:42.708 --> 59:43.708
Landed up in an orphanage,

59:44.250 --> 59:45.417
then a juvenile center,

59:46.333 --> 59:47.583
then a remand home.

59:52.667 --> 59:56.833
So, it was really my country
that raised me.

59:58.667 --> 1:00:00.167
When I was older,

1:00:01.167 --> 1:00:02.500
I wanted to be a good son

1:00:03.458 --> 1:00:05.667
and serve my parents.
Pay them back.

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:09.458
So I joined the Indian army.

1:00:14.875 --> 1:00:15.833
I'm sorry.

1:00:16.042 --> 1:00:17.208
No, it's okay.

1:00:19.083 --> 1:00:20.083
By the way...

1:00:21.667 --> 1:00:23.958
what film was playing
at the cinema where they left you?

1:00:30.292 --> 1:00:31.917
You don't take emotions seriously?

1:00:33.917 --> 1:00:34.875
Do you?

1:00:39.250 --> 1:00:40.083
Never.

1:00:42.042 --> 1:00:45.458
So... how did you turn from
Lawaaris to Khuda Gawah?

1:00:47.292 --> 1:00:48.208
It was in 2002.

1:00:48.625 --> 1:00:51.417
I was in Afghanistan on a joint
mission with the US army.

1:00:53.542 --> 1:00:54.542
My first mission.

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:55.417
U.S.A. MILITARY BASE, AFGHANISTAN

1:00:55.500 --> 1:00:57.500
The US target that day
was a Salauddin Husseini,

1:00:57.833 --> 1:00:58.917
a Taliban leader.

1:00:59.458 --> 1:01:02.083
A missile was locked
on to the location of his phone.

1:01:06.667 --> 1:01:10.875
This Mr. Husseini was a teacher
in a madrasa.

1:01:11.833 --> 1:01:12.833
People started to run.

1:01:13.917 --> 1:01:17.417
The problem was there were
30 kids still in the madrasa,

1:01:17.750 --> 1:01:20.083
and the missile was to strike
in one minute.

1:01:21.208 --> 1:01:23.417
The missile was locked
on to the location of his phone.

1:01:24.125 --> 1:01:26.167
The kids were still inside.

1:01:46.750 --> 1:01:48.500
I was in a coma for a month.

1:01:49.375 --> 1:01:55.375
A day did not go by without someone
in that village praying for me.

1:01:59.042 --> 1:02:00.083
Subhanallah.

1:02:04.792 --> 1:02:05.750
How are you?

1:02:06.875 --> 1:02:07.750
Hmm.

1:02:08.292 --> 1:02:09.667
-Adaab.
-Salaam.

1:02:10.833 --> 1:02:14.125
Everyone has been praying
for your good health.

1:02:15.208 --> 1:02:18.083
I swear, no Pathaan mother

1:02:18.333 --> 1:02:21.625
has ever given birth to someone
as brave as you.

1:02:22.292 --> 1:02:25.042
From today, we are yours
and you are ours.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.125
Our Pathaan.

1:02:35.125 --> 1:02:36.083
You know what?

1:02:36.875 --> 1:02:39.917
Every year, without fail, I try...

1:02:40.458 --> 1:02:43.583
and celebrate Eid with everyone
in that village.

1:02:46.875 --> 1:02:48.875
With my Pathaan family.

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:09.875
Oh, man...

1:04:17.250 --> 1:04:19.083
Once we have the bag, we have
ten minutes. Don't forget.

1:04:31.542 --> 1:04:33.208
Set.
- Rubai, start your timer now.

1:04:33.708 --> 1:04:35.375
Three, two, one.

1:04:35.792 --> 1:04:36.958
-Go!

1:04:38.125 --> 1:04:39.708
Karen, do you have a copy...

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:41.542
Who are you?

1:05:08.417 --> 1:05:11.083
-

1:05:47.208 --> 1:05:48.125
MALFUNCTION

1:05:48.917 --> 1:05:49.917
Rubai!

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:52.667
I have a release malfunction.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.667
Rubai, when you're
above the building, cut your rope.

1:06:06.125 --> 1:06:07.625
Captain, listen to me.

1:06:09.292 --> 1:06:10.333
Are you crazy?

1:06:10.792 --> 1:06:11.708
Just do it!

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:19.667
What the...

1:07:42.792 --> 1:07:43.875
We're 90 seconds late.

1:07:43.917 --> 1:07:45.667
The alarm will go off
in a minute. Let's go!

1:07:47.708 --> 1:07:49.083
-Vault number?
-412.

1:08:05.875 --> 1:08:07.083
How do these steps open?

1:08:07.542 --> 1:08:08.417
No time for that.

1:08:20.333 --> 1:08:21.250
Here.

1:08:24.708 --> 1:08:25.583
Throw it to me.

1:08:33.917 --> 1:08:34.833
Pathaan...

1:08:35.750 --> 1:08:36.667
I'm sorry.

1:08:54.708 --> 1:08:56.417
It's impossible
to open that vault.

1:08:56.875 --> 1:08:57.750
It is possible.

1:08:58.792 --> 1:08:59.667
For Pathaan.

1:08:59.833 --> 1:09:00.667
Pathaan?

1:09:01.208 --> 1:09:02.625
Why would he help you?

1:09:05.667 --> 1:09:06.583
Mate-check.

1:09:07.167 --> 1:09:08.292
You mean "checkmate"?

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:11.875
When the king thinks the queen
will sacrifice herself for him,

1:09:12.458 --> 1:09:15.625
and all his concentration
is on saving the queen.

1:09:20.167 --> 1:09:23.125
When the king realizes the queen
has switched sides, it'll be...

1:09:24.583 --> 1:09:25.542
too late.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:27.917
Checkmate.

1:09:30.667 --> 1:09:33.042
The king is dead.

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:04.083
PRESENT DAY

1:10:05.667 --> 1:10:07.250
Please be seated for landing.

1:10:09.375 --> 1:10:12.167
So, did the Russians arrest Pathaan?

1:10:13.833 --> 1:10:14.833
Yes.

1:10:15.417 --> 1:10:17.042
And they tortured him badly.

1:10:19.208 --> 1:10:21.583
BLACK PRISON

1:10:28.708 --> 1:10:30.625
Not that one, not that one!

1:10:30.792 --> 1:10:31.958
It will hurt like hell.

1:10:42.375 --> 1:10:43.667
Talk, Pathaan.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.958
You know everyone talks in the end.

1:10:47.625 --> 1:10:48.917
Your Hindi is damn good.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:53.083
Was your mother in India?
Or a joint operation?

1:10:55.708 --> 1:10:58.667
I know you can take a lot of pain.

1:10:59.208 --> 1:11:00.167
How much more?

1:11:04.750 --> 1:11:07.458
Pathaan was put into
a high security prison.

1:11:08.125 --> 1:11:10.333
That's where I last saw him.

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:29.875
He's not with us.

1:11:31.125 --> 1:11:32.875
Oh, please, Ms. Grewal.

1:11:33.458 --> 1:11:35.375
We know he's Marcos's agent.

1:11:36.042 --> 1:11:36.958
He was.

1:11:37.292 --> 1:11:38.250
He went rogue.

1:11:38.833 --> 1:11:40.625
Do you think
we would sanction this stupidity?

1:11:41.958 --> 1:11:45.042
Whatever he has done,
we have no stake in it.

1:11:45.667 --> 1:11:49.750
So you don't care how we deal
with this situation?

1:11:51.125 --> 1:11:52.250
Be my guest.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:56.542
And if this
situation survives...

1:11:57.625 --> 1:11:59.917
pump him with two bullets from me.

1:12:01.208 --> 1:12:02.667
I'll reimburse you.

1:12:05.167 --> 1:12:07.792
-

1:13:08.125 --> 1:13:10.917
I'm going to
crush your bones to powder.

1:13:11.625 --> 1:13:14.333
You're a dead man walking.

1:13:30.375 --> 1:13:31.500
What was he saying?

1:13:36.292 --> 1:13:39.542
I'm going to kill you.

1:14:30.458 --> 1:14:33.000
Ow!

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:35.292
Guys. Timeout, guys!

1:14:35.917 --> 1:14:36.792
Please.

1:14:37.125 --> 1:14:38.167
Wait...

1:14:39.167 --> 1:14:40.375
-

1:15:28.292 --> 1:15:29.792
Stopped at a coffee shop?

1:15:30.208 --> 1:15:31.125
And a pharmacy.

1:15:31.667 --> 1:15:32.625
Here. Painkillers.

1:15:33.792 --> 1:15:35.625
Men don't feel pain.

1:15:35.750 --> 1:15:37.000
-Hmm.
-

1:15:37.208 --> 1:15:38.167
Take them, brother.

1:15:38.875 --> 1:15:39.833
They're coming.

1:16:02.125 --> 1:16:03.250
You've taken it easy too long.

1:16:04.333 --> 1:16:05.917
Let's get to work.

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:31.875
Tiger, he's got a grenade!

1:16:32.083 --> 1:16:33.042
So what!

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.708
I have the pin.

1:16:35.458 --> 1:16:37.167
When will you stop pulling pins?

1:16:38.208 --> 1:16:39.125
I'm sorry.

1:16:59.875 --> 1:17:01.583
I'm having a blast.
Are you?

1:17:03.792 --> 1:17:04.833
Oh, man!

1:17:15.792 --> 1:17:16.708
Behind you!

1:17:38.625 --> 1:17:40.333
Mission accomplished!
-Hmm.

1:17:45.792 --> 1:17:47.500
Did they come for you?
-Mm-hmm.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:48.583
For you.

1:17:50.583 --> 1:17:52.000
You made big trouble, didn't you?

1:17:52.208 --> 1:17:53.208
I'm a Pathaan.

1:17:53.917 --> 1:17:55.375
-Shall we run?
-Me first.

1:18:15.250 --> 1:18:16.708
You got scared, right?

1:18:16.958 --> 1:18:18.125
-Yes.
- I know.

1:18:18.625 --> 1:18:19.500
For you.

1:19:01.792 --> 1:19:03.750
-

1:19:07.542 --> 1:19:08.417
Look back!

1:20:05.917 --> 1:20:06.750
Run!

1:20:06.792 --> 1:20:08.542
Run, Pathaan! Run!

1:20:48.500 --> 1:20:49.542
-Listen.
- Hmm.

1:20:50.667 --> 1:20:52.125
I'm going on a big mission.

1:20:52.458 --> 1:20:53.333
Hmm.

1:20:54.333 --> 1:20:56.250
Tiger may need Pathaan.

1:20:57.625 --> 1:20:58.667
So stay alive.

1:21:01.375 --> 1:21:03.375
I will. I'll be there.

1:21:04.417 --> 1:21:06.958
Oh, man. I promise.

1:21:07.083 --> 1:21:08.667
-Don't need promises.
-Then what?

1:21:08.833 --> 1:21:10.125
I need those painkillers.

1:21:11.042 --> 1:21:14.000
Oh, painkillers. It's here.

1:21:17.333 --> 1:21:18.667
This is yours, this is mine.

1:21:26.667 --> 1:21:27.917
Bitter, isn't it?

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:29.958
It's a painkiller.
Not chewing gum.

1:21:33.542 --> 1:21:35.500
PRESENT DAY

1:21:36.083 --> 1:21:37.708
So, Tiger helped Pathaan in Russia?

1:21:38.625 --> 1:21:40.208
How come Pathaan was missing
for so long?

1:21:40.583 --> 1:21:42.708
That was the first time
anyone had defeated Pathaan.

1:21:43.583 --> 1:21:44.875
He swore...

1:21:45.625 --> 1:21:47.750
without Rubai, Jim and Raktbeej...

1:21:48.333 --> 1:21:49.833
he would not return.

1:21:50.833 --> 1:21:53.375
To maintain diplomatic relations
with Russia,

1:21:54.125 --> 1:21:56.500
Pathaan's absence suited us.

1:21:58.083 --> 1:21:59.083
And now?

1:21:59.625 --> 1:22:03.375
The time of Pathaan's exile is over.

1:22:27.042 --> 1:22:28.917
Pump him with two bullets from me.

1:22:30.875 --> 1:22:31.792
What could I have said?

1:22:32.542 --> 1:22:33.625
Pathaan is like a son to me,

1:22:36.917 --> 1:22:38.792
Why did Luthra let you go to Russia?

1:22:39.833 --> 1:22:40.708
Don't ask.

1:22:41.208 --> 1:22:42.417
He wanted to go himself.

1:22:43.042 --> 1:22:45.042
He would've shot you point-blank

1:22:45.792 --> 1:22:49.375
if he knew the reason
that I went there was to give you...

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.208
a message.

1:22:54.792 --> 1:22:55.917
He's not with us.

1:22:57.333 --> 1:23:00.583
WHY YOU HERE

1:23:01.958 --> 1:23:05.250
TIGER ON WAY

1:23:09.708 --> 1:23:10.917
Did Raafe tell you anything?

1:23:11.667 --> 1:23:12.500
Hmm.

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:14.625
Jim bought two Saber missiles.

1:23:15.375 --> 1:23:16.542
He doesn't know why,

1:23:17.250 --> 1:23:18.250
or where Jim is.

1:23:19.542 --> 1:23:20.500
Or...

1:23:21.542 --> 1:23:22.458
where she is.

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:25.167
Hmm.

1:23:29.500 --> 1:23:31.250
-Paris? When?
-

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.000
A few hours ago.

1:23:34.250 --> 1:23:35.083
Activity?

1:23:36.083 --> 1:23:37.750
Walks, cafes.

1:23:39.083 --> 1:23:42.000
Perhaps she's waiting for someone.

1:23:43.208 --> 1:23:45.542
Then I have to go.
-

1:23:47.417 --> 1:23:48.875
Can't keep a girl waiting.

1:23:49.833 --> 1:23:52.417
Pathaan, I don't know what
you stole from the Russians,

1:23:53.750 --> 1:23:55.583
but I've never seen them so tense.

1:23:57.417 --> 1:23:58.333
Find it.

1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:00.417
Find Jim.

1:24:01.875 --> 1:24:02.833
Ma'am.

1:24:10.333 --> 1:24:12.833
PARIS, FRANCE

1:25:06.125 --> 1:25:07.208
Salaam Alaikum.

1:25:08.583 --> 1:25:11.125
Wa 'alaikumu s-salaam.
May peace be upon on you too.

1:25:13.250 --> 1:25:14.125
Thank you, Raza.

1:25:16.500 --> 1:25:20.833
In romantic Paris,
two's company, three's a crowd.

1:25:21.792 --> 1:25:24.667
I must talk to her about
the pleasures of love.

1:25:25.875 --> 1:25:26.833
Alone.

1:25:29.292 --> 1:25:30.167
Alone, Raza.

1:25:32.417 --> 1:25:33.292
Thank you.

1:25:33.500 --> 1:25:35.917
You want to talk to me?
Or kill me?

1:25:38.250 --> 1:25:40.833
I figured
when I'd see you again,

1:25:41.583 --> 1:25:42.833
I'd shoot you first,

1:25:43.583 --> 1:25:45.208
then ask questions.

1:25:48.375 --> 1:25:52.292
But you called me here
of your own accord, so...

1:25:55.375 --> 1:25:56.292
Of course, Rubai...

1:25:58.167 --> 1:26:01.333
we conveniently got your photo
at the Paris metro.

1:26:02.083 --> 1:26:05.667
You knew I'd see that CCTV footage.
And I would...

1:26:08.167 --> 1:26:09.042
come to you.

1:26:09.625 --> 1:26:10.750
So, well, I'm here.

1:26:11.750 --> 1:26:13.208
Tell me quickly
what you have to say.

1:26:14.583 --> 1:26:16.250
-Raktbeej.
-

1:26:19.958 --> 1:26:21.250
You want to know what it is?

1:26:21.958 --> 1:26:22.875
What is it?

1:26:26.958 --> 1:26:27.958
Smallpox?

1:26:30.292 --> 1:26:32.417
It was eradicated in 1980.

1:26:34.667 --> 1:26:35.667
Yes...

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:39.250
but some research facilities
still have samples of the virus,

1:26:40.292 --> 1:26:42.667
in case we need to fight smallpox again.

1:26:44.333 --> 1:26:45.417
The virus samples were in Russia.

1:26:46.917 --> 1:26:48.042
We stole them.

1:26:49.792 --> 1:26:50.750
But why?

1:26:51.875 --> 1:26:54.542
Every country in this world
has a vaccine against smallpox.

1:26:58.292 --> 1:26:59.958
In case of an emergency outbreak.

1:27:00.792 --> 1:27:03.042
The vaccine works against
the old smallpox virus.

1:27:05.125 --> 1:27:06.875
Jim has mutated it.

1:27:08.167 --> 1:27:11.542
The mutated virus is far more dangerous.

1:27:11.625 --> 1:27:15.125
We have no vaccine against it.
No cure either.

1:27:16.375 --> 1:27:20.625
That's why he planned the big operation
in Dubai to kidnap Dr. Sahani.

1:27:30.208 --> 1:27:32.458
Who for? Who's paying him?

1:27:33.750 --> 1:27:36.000
-Do you know General Qadir?
-

1:27:40.708 --> 1:27:43.042
It's time to befriend the Devil.

1:27:46.208 --> 1:27:47.958
-Your government?
-No.

1:27:48.375 --> 1:27:51.250
The General joined forces
with ISI extremists...

1:27:52.208 --> 1:27:55.083
when India abrogated Article 370.

1:27:56.708 --> 1:27:57.792
Pathaan, I swear...

1:27:59.208 --> 1:28:01.292
I had no idea at all...

1:28:04.167 --> 1:28:08.292
that my own people would
do such a mad thing.

1:28:09.042 --> 1:28:10.458
If this virus spreads...

1:28:12.958 --> 1:28:14.875
how can Pakistan save itself?

1:28:15.208 --> 1:28:17.375
He has changed the virus's DNA.

1:28:19.000 --> 1:28:21.500
It does not follow the one-week
pattern like Covid-19.

1:28:23.125 --> 1:28:24.708
This kills within a few hours.

1:28:26.125 --> 1:28:29.417
Anyone infected by this virus
cannot go very far.

1:28:30.750 --> 1:28:35.417
Once it spreads, it decimates
a whole city in a matter of days.

1:28:36.375 --> 1:28:38.958
But it can also be contained
within a city's borders.

1:28:40.792 --> 1:28:42.375
It attacks one city at a time.

1:28:44.208 --> 1:28:45.292
Not the whole world.

1:28:48.042 --> 1:28:49.000
But how, Rubai?

1:28:52.458 --> 1:28:56.500
So why do you think
I can trust you again?

1:28:58.958 --> 1:29:00.458
I'm a soldier, Pathaan.

1:29:01.917 --> 1:29:02.917
Just like you...

1:29:04.708 --> 1:29:06.667
I will do anything for my country.

1:29:08.125 --> 1:29:09.125
But this?

1:29:10.583 --> 1:29:12.250
Killing thousands of innocents?

1:29:14.292 --> 1:29:15.292
This is not my idea of war.

1:29:22.917 --> 1:29:24.000
Trust me, Pathaan.

1:29:26.417 --> 1:29:27.542
Just once more.

1:29:30.375 --> 1:29:32.375
I'll always have my eye on you.

1:29:35.417 --> 1:29:36.333
One wrong move--

1:29:36.417 --> 1:29:38.542
I've made all the wrong moves I had to.

1:29:40.458 --> 1:29:42.250
Now I want them erased.

1:29:45.375 --> 1:29:46.333
Where's Jim?

1:29:48.875 --> 1:29:51.875
He's meeting Dr. Sahani
in his lab in two days.

1:29:56.333 --> 1:29:57.500
Tell me about this lab.

1:30:00.125 --> 1:30:01.042
Everything.

1:30:22.417 --> 1:30:23.708
So good to see you, sir!

1:30:25.167 --> 1:30:27.542
Mm-hmm... if we survive,
we'll hug then.

1:30:27.625 --> 1:30:28.792
Everybody, back to work.

1:30:28.875 --> 1:30:30.750
-I'll never hug you.
-

1:30:31.208 --> 1:30:33.000
There's only one way.

1:30:33.083 --> 1:30:34.125
Parachutes.

1:30:34.583 --> 1:30:37.292
Land here, above the lab,
and work your way down there.

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:39.583
Rubai?

1:30:41.000 --> 1:30:42.000
Pathaan...

1:30:42.333 --> 1:30:45.125
how can you trust her
after what happened in Russia?

1:30:46.500 --> 1:30:48.417
Okay.
We won't trust her.

1:30:49.250 --> 1:30:50.292
Next plan?

1:30:50.583 --> 1:30:51.542
Use a missile.

1:30:52.167 --> 1:30:53.167
Blow up the lab.

1:30:53.958 --> 1:30:55.792
And Jim, the virus, the lot.

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:58.583
What if the virus isn't destroyed
and it gets into the air?

1:30:59.542 --> 1:31:01.542
The virus could come down as rain...

1:31:01.958 --> 1:31:03.375
over three continents.

1:31:04.208 --> 1:31:05.542
Alright, Pathaan.

1:31:06.375 --> 1:31:07.333
Make it happen.

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:09.083
-Ma'am.
-And...

1:31:09.375 --> 1:31:10.333
get a trim.

1:31:13.958 --> 1:31:14.958
Really?

1:31:43.167 --> 1:31:44.125
Rubai!

1:31:45.625 --> 1:31:46.542
Jim.

1:31:48.792 --> 1:31:49.792
Looking good.

1:31:50.417 --> 1:31:51.375
Always.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:53.833
But you
haven't noticed me before.

1:31:54.375 --> 1:31:57.167
Who says
love is only at first sight?

1:32:09.083 --> 1:32:10.000
Want to drown in them?

1:32:14.833 --> 1:32:17.375
I know the difference
between the sea and lava.

1:32:33.125 --> 1:32:34.792
Did you design the virus as instructed?

1:32:51.875 --> 1:32:53.708
Are you really going to do this?

1:32:55.708 --> 1:32:56.750
For money?

1:32:57.125 --> 1:32:58.708
You think this is about money?

1:33:00.417 --> 1:33:02.667
I could've easily robbed a bank
blindfolded, Doctor.

1:33:05.125 --> 1:33:07.292
I was asked a question once.

1:33:08.667 --> 1:33:10.042
What's your price?

1:33:19.875 --> 1:33:21.125
Today you have my answer.

1:33:22.833 --> 1:33:26.500
And I will decide the price of your life.

1:33:28.375 --> 1:33:29.292
Do you have the power to buy me?

1:33:30.083 --> 1:33:30.958
So buy me.

1:33:31.542 --> 1:33:32.833
This is crazy.

1:33:34.417 --> 1:33:36.000
These are your own people.

1:33:37.333 --> 1:33:38.458
Your own country.

1:33:38.833 --> 1:33:40.292
Oh, Doc!

1:33:40.792 --> 1:33:42.500
Country, borders, etcetera.

1:33:43.333 --> 1:33:45.958
They exist to remind the weak
to stay in their place.

1:33:46.917 --> 1:33:48.542
While the real machines keep turning.

1:33:49.125 --> 1:33:51.375
Power and control.

1:33:52.458 --> 1:33:54.458
I don't care
for any country now.

1:33:55.750 --> 1:33:59.083
My country is wherever I happen to be.

1:34:00.833 --> 1:34:01.750
That's my world.

1:34:07.542 --> 1:34:08.750
SATELLITE PREF LOCATION

1:34:13.083 --> 1:34:14.042
Let me check.

1:34:34.667 --> 1:34:36.000
-

1:34:38.417 --> 1:34:39.458
CENTER D'INNOVATION
ET DE RECHFRCHE

1:34:42.792 --> 1:34:43.750
Stay out.

1:34:44.167 --> 1:34:47.292
If anything happens to these
orbs, then cut your own throat.

1:35:09.375 --> 1:35:10.375
Dr. Sahani!

1:35:10.750 --> 1:35:11.708
Dr. Sahani!

1:35:13.042 --> 1:35:14.125
Give me the orbs.

1:35:20.500 --> 1:35:22.500
-

1:35:26.208 --> 1:35:27.208
The orbs are safe.

1:35:28.125 --> 1:35:29.000
Let's go.

1:35:31.583 --> 1:35:33.208
Jim, I was trying to keep
Raktbeej safe...

1:35:33.250 --> 1:35:36.125
Normally when you lie,
it's so smoothly done.

1:35:37.625 --> 1:35:39.417
I'm touched you're scared of me.

1:35:39.542 --> 1:35:42.042
-Jim, trust me, I--
-Explain to your people...

1:35:43.625 --> 1:35:45.208
how you betrayed them.

1:35:46.750 --> 1:35:48.583
General Qadir is not "my people".

1:35:50.083 --> 1:35:52.542
When my people hear what he has done,

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.083
they'll bloody hang him.

1:35:59.375 --> 1:36:01.167
I... I have a daughter.

1:36:01.375 --> 1:36:04.333
I wanted you to stay alive for her sake.

1:36:10.833 --> 1:36:11.792
Bag?

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:30.917
-

1:37:57.500 --> 1:37:58.708
He must be close.

1:40:48.417 --> 1:40:49.375
Give it to me, Pathaan.

1:40:50.500 --> 1:40:51.875
No, sir. We have to destroy it.

1:40:52.125 --> 1:40:54.333
Right now.

1:40:54.417 --> 1:40:55.875
Absolutely not.

1:40:56.833 --> 1:40:59.500
Jim has mutated
the smallpox virus,

1:41:00.417 --> 1:41:02.917
-so we need to make a vaccine.
- I don't think so, sir.

1:41:03.000 --> 1:41:03.958
Give it to me.

1:41:04.417 --> 1:41:05.292
Sir.

1:41:07.583 --> 1:41:08.500
Sir...

1:41:11.750 --> 1:41:13.292
-Pathaan!

1:41:14.500 --> 1:41:16.250
What the hell, sir?
-

1:41:16.333 --> 1:41:17.167
What's going on?

1:41:17.250 --> 1:41:18.625
She's ISI, Pathaan.

1:41:18.875 --> 1:41:21.583
We have the virus orb, thanks to her.

1:41:21.833 --> 1:41:24.083
And thanks to her,
the virus landed in Jim's hands.

1:41:25.417 --> 1:41:27.083
She knows Jim's plans.

1:41:30.458 --> 1:41:31.375
We have
to question her, Pathaan.

1:41:31.417 --> 1:41:32.250
Ma'am...

1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:34.042
Besides, where can she go now?

1:41:34.542 --> 1:41:36.667
Jim and the ISI are looking for her.

1:41:37.417 --> 1:41:38.292
If we let her go,

1:41:39.458 --> 1:41:40.875
she won't survive for two days.

1:41:42.417 --> 1:41:43.292
Take her.

1:41:43.375 --> 1:41:44.708
Wait!
-

1:41:52.250 --> 1:41:53.208
Pathaan...

1:41:56.167 --> 1:41:57.208
You'll be okay.

1:41:59.958 --> 1:42:00.917
Pathaan's promise.

1:42:11.917 --> 1:42:12.875
-Where's Jim?
-

1:42:12.875 --> 1:42:14.208
Where is the antivirus?

1:42:14.250 --> 1:42:15.667
What is the missile's target?

1:42:15.750 --> 1:42:17.417
You know his plans.

1:42:17.458 --> 1:42:20.208
You think we believe
you know nothing!

1:42:20.250 --> 1:42:21.375
No one knows anything.

1:42:21.667 --> 1:42:24.583
What Jim thinks or plans,
only Jim knows.

1:42:24.958 --> 1:42:28.250
If anything goes wrong,
he has a backup plan.

1:42:28.375 --> 1:42:30.875
Things may be going wrong
for him right now,

1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:32.875
but soon his backup plan will kick in.

1:42:33.292 --> 1:42:34.500
This screw-up must have been...

1:42:35.542 --> 1:42:36.708
planned by Jim.

1:42:37.083 --> 1:42:39.792
INDIAN INSTITUTE OF
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES

1:42:51.333 --> 1:42:52.750
Ma'am, you'll have to wear this suit.

1:42:54.708 --> 1:42:55.583
Yes, Doctor?

1:42:56.083 --> 1:42:57.500
I got your message.

1:42:57.750 --> 1:42:59.292
Come, Nandini.
I must show you something.

1:42:59.375 --> 1:43:00.333
Show me.

1:43:00.417 --> 1:43:03.042
There are three layers
to get to the orb's core.

1:43:04.125 --> 1:43:07.375
Did you cut through?
-We got to the central core.

1:43:07.542 --> 1:43:08.583
Where the virus is.

1:43:09.292 --> 1:43:10.458
It was empty.

1:43:10.917 --> 1:43:11.833
What?

1:43:11.917 --> 1:43:13.333
We analyzed the liquid carefully.

1:43:13.750 --> 1:43:15.375
It's water. Only water.

1:43:17.458 --> 1:43:18.750
-

1:43:18.833 --> 1:43:20.000
What happened to the lights?

1:43:20.083 --> 1:43:22.083
Ma'am, our system has been hacked.

1:43:22.458 --> 1:43:23.750
There's an incoming
video call.

1:43:24.292 --> 1:43:25.208
It's Jim.

1:43:25.917 --> 1:43:26.833
Connect him.

1:43:30.625 --> 1:43:33.000
Hello, hello! How's everyone?

1:43:33.750 --> 1:43:34.667
Was it fun?

1:43:34.833 --> 1:43:38.375
Finding only pure distilled
mineral water in the orb?

1:43:38.750 --> 1:43:40.500
What the hell are you playing at, Jim?

1:43:40.958 --> 1:43:44.375
Just following my plan in case
anyone tried to force the orbs open.

1:43:44.958 --> 1:43:46.542
The orb has three layers.

1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:48.208
The first layer was empty.

1:43:49.333 --> 1:43:50.292
Only a vacuum.

1:43:50.958 --> 1:43:52.750
The second layer wasn't empty.

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:55.583
It contained an invisible corrosive gas.

1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:00.042
It's an acid that
melts plastic on contact.

1:44:00.625 --> 1:44:02.208
Your plastic suits, for example.

1:44:04.208 --> 1:44:06.708
The third layer contained my superstar.

1:44:09.208 --> 1:44:10.208
Raktbeej.

1:44:11.375 --> 1:44:13.167
The virus is now all over the lab.

1:44:13.792 --> 1:44:16.583
In the orb's center, you'll find
clean safe mineral water.

1:44:17.375 --> 1:44:20.792
You won't feel thirsty
when you're dying.

1:44:22.542 --> 1:44:23.542
You think I'm bluffing?

1:44:24.208 --> 1:44:26.417
Look at your
pretty white suits.

1:44:28.167 --> 1:44:29.542
Are they turning black?

1:44:31.292 --> 1:44:33.000
Your suits are of no use now.

1:44:33.417 --> 1:44:35.167
The virus you were
looking for in the water

1:44:35.875 --> 1:44:37.917
is invading your whole body.

1:44:42.208 --> 1:44:45.250
If pain is measured on a scale of ten...

1:44:47.542 --> 1:44:50.208
you'll experience it at 13 or 14.

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:51.958
Exciting, right?

1:44:52.875 --> 1:44:54.958
A demo of Raktbeej.

1:44:57.500 --> 1:45:01.167
So please, share your dying moments
on Instagram and Twitter.

1:45:01.792 --> 1:45:04.583
Things that are seen... they sell.

1:45:06.875 --> 1:45:07.833
Cheers!

1:45:09.208 --> 1:45:10.208
No!

1:45:10.833 --> 1:45:11.833
Lock down the lab!

1:45:12.292 --> 1:45:13.292
Lock the lab!

1:45:14.583 --> 1:45:16.750
Lock the lab!

1:45:16.875 --> 1:45:20.500
Others, get out of here!
-

1:45:20.583 --> 1:45:22.125
We're sealing the lab.

1:45:26.458 --> 1:45:28.083
Get out! Get out now!

1:45:28.167 --> 1:45:29.458
Get out all of you!

1:45:34.250 --> 1:45:37.208
We can decontaminate the atmosphere.

1:45:37.750 --> 1:45:39.583
UV radiation, gamma rays.

1:45:39.750 --> 1:45:42.042
But how can you
decontaminate us, Luthra?

1:45:42.667 --> 1:45:44.208
The virus is inside us.

1:45:53.042 --> 1:45:54.208
There's only one way.

1:46:09.708 --> 1:46:14.833
Very few people get the chance
to decide how they'll face their death.

1:46:15.375 --> 1:46:17.875
With fear? Hesitation?
Or will they panic?

1:46:20.250 --> 1:46:25.250
I will not give a bloody terrorist
that satisfaction.

1:46:26.083 --> 1:46:27.250
I'm a soldier.

1:46:29.167 --> 1:46:30.125
And now...

1:46:31.917 --> 1:46:32.917
all of you are too.

1:46:34.667 --> 1:46:36.167
Everyone dies someday...

1:46:38.625 --> 1:46:40.250
today it's our turn.

1:46:44.083 --> 1:46:45.208
I accept it.

1:47:03.167 --> 1:47:05.917
Colonel, you know what to do.

1:47:23.292 --> 1:47:25.083
Don't save RDX.

1:47:25.625 --> 1:47:26.833
We'll be dead anyway.

1:47:28.333 --> 1:47:31.250
Just make sure the virus does not spread.

1:47:33.667 --> 1:47:34.500
Thank you.

1:47:35.167 --> 1:47:36.167
Thank you, everyone.

1:47:36.875 --> 1:47:39.125
It was a great honor serving with you.

1:47:40.667 --> 1:47:44.583
You're the molten gold
that kept my life together.

1:47:49.375 --> 1:47:50.333
Ma'am...

1:47:54.458 --> 1:47:56.375
You are that gold now, Pathaan.

1:47:58.042 --> 1:47:59.750
You'll keep everyone together,

1:48:01.083 --> 1:48:02.333
and make them strong.

1:48:03.417 --> 1:48:04.542
You were always...

1:48:08.167 --> 1:48:09.042
the one who kept us together.

1:48:18.958 --> 1:48:20.000
Don't stop.

1:48:20.875 --> 1:48:21.833
Get Jim.

1:48:27.417 --> 1:48:29.875
I promise, ma'am.

1:48:30.792 --> 1:48:32.333
Make him die a death...

1:48:34.167 --> 1:48:35.833
far worse than ours.

1:48:46.083 --> 1:48:47.042
Ma'am.

1:49:15.208 --> 1:49:16.542
I hated guns.

1:49:19.667 --> 1:49:20.917
In the name of Lord Shiva!

1:49:53.583 --> 1:49:54.792
Hello, everyone.

1:49:56.292 --> 1:49:58.500
I know
this is a bad time for all of you.

1:49:59.458 --> 1:50:01.042
I respect your pain.

1:50:01.667 --> 1:50:04.875
So, I'll do my best
not to appear too cheerful.

1:50:05.917 --> 1:50:06.833
But come on!

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:08.917
It was some plan!

1:50:10.333 --> 1:50:11.667
You should be impressed.

1:50:12.167 --> 1:50:13.833
You were an Indian soldier. Dammit!

1:50:14.083 --> 1:50:17.000
And thanks to you,
I'm an Indian businessman now.

1:50:17.917 --> 1:50:20.833
If you survive, you might
become a client of mine.

1:50:21.042 --> 1:50:22.375
Then I'll get you anything you want.

1:50:22.958 --> 1:50:24.250
Right now, I serve another client.

1:50:24.875 --> 1:50:26.542
I'm doing what he wants.

1:50:26.750 --> 1:50:28.292
Do you even realize what you're doing?

1:50:28.833 --> 1:50:30.583
You're unleashing your wrath on humanity!

1:50:31.375 --> 1:50:33.625
History will
remember you as a monster!

1:50:33.750 --> 1:50:36.125
Oh! That never occurred to me.

1:50:36.458 --> 1:50:37.417
What can I do?

1:50:37.875 --> 1:50:39.167
Everything is ready.

1:50:40.917 --> 1:50:42.500
My Saber missile.

1:50:42.917 --> 1:50:44.042
Armed and ready.

1:50:44.792 --> 1:50:47.708
It's in a location
that only I know.

1:50:48.542 --> 1:50:49.375
The target?

1:50:50.042 --> 1:50:53.250
An Indian city, that only I know.

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.083
Such a pity!

1:50:55.500 --> 1:50:59.875
You blew up your lab before you could
see what Raktbeej was capable of.

1:51:00.500 --> 1:51:03.583
But when it spreads in Delhi,
Mumbai, Hyderabad or Amritsar...

1:51:05.583 --> 1:51:06.542
what will you do?

1:51:07.125 --> 1:51:08.625
Blow up those cities?

1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000
What do you want?

1:51:10.208 --> 1:51:13.292
I want you to negotiate with
a terrorist, Colonel Luthra.

1:51:13.917 --> 1:51:15.167
You didn't do it for me.

1:51:16.375 --> 1:51:17.833
Now you'll negotiate with me.

1:51:19.125 --> 1:51:21.875
What do you want?

1:51:22.292 --> 1:51:24.208
What do you think?

1:51:26.083 --> 1:51:26.917
Kashmir.

1:51:28.125 --> 1:51:30.000
Obviously, Kashmir.

1:51:31.583 --> 1:51:32.875
You have 24 hours.

1:51:33.833 --> 1:51:36.500
After 24 hours,
if a single soldier,

1:51:37.417 --> 1:51:39.750
a single tank, a single gun...

1:51:41.375 --> 1:51:43.708
or the Indian flag
is seen in Kashmir, then...

1:51:44.125 --> 1:51:45.292
That's impossible!

1:51:46.042 --> 1:51:47.708
How can I
make that happen in 24 hours?

1:51:49.250 --> 1:51:50.833
We need time to think.

1:51:50.917 --> 1:51:53.958
Perhaps I used the wrong word,
that's why you're confused.

1:51:54.667 --> 1:51:56.458
This is not a negotiation, Colonel Luthra,

1:51:57.125 --> 1:51:58.250
it's an ultimatum.

1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:00.708
Your time starts...

1:52:03.792 --> 1:52:04.625
...now.

1:52:08.208 --> 1:52:09.292
The situation you're in,

1:52:10.083 --> 1:52:11.875
the fear that's overcoming you,

1:52:12.417 --> 1:52:13.750
I've been there.

1:52:16.042 --> 1:52:21.000
No one took responsibility for
the death of my wife and unborn child.

1:52:21.917 --> 1:52:24.333
And now no one is
responsible for your death.

1:52:26.792 --> 1:52:27.833
How does it feel, guys?

1:52:29.792 --> 1:52:31.583
It's not appropriate
to say "Jai Hind".

1:52:32.500 --> 1:52:33.500
So, take care.

1:52:34.667 --> 1:52:35.833
Time is running out.

1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:42.208
Pathaan, you have to
stop this madman.

1:52:42.583 --> 1:52:44.000
-

1:52:45.917 --> 1:52:49.083
Mm-hmm. Look! Your innocent family.

1:52:49.250 --> 1:52:51.958
You know what we'll do to them?

1:52:54.708 --> 1:52:59.583
Whichever city the missile strikes,
that's where your family will be.

1:53:01.583 --> 1:53:02.875
Where is that missile?

1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:04.625
My job...

1:53:05.333 --> 1:53:07.875
was only to make payment.

1:53:08.208 --> 1:53:09.125
Mm-hmm.

1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.417
I said Jim would tell them
where to deliver it.

1:53:16.083 --> 1:53:17.542
If you don't know the city,

1:53:18.250 --> 1:53:19.625
you must know the country.

1:53:20.292 --> 1:53:21.417
Where?

1:53:25.417 --> 1:53:26.833
Afghanistan.

1:53:32.500 --> 1:53:33.708
Father!

1:53:34.292 --> 1:53:35.167
Father!

1:54:06.417 --> 1:54:07.708
I'm sorry, Rubai.

1:54:07.958 --> 1:54:09.833
Fear blinds people.

1:54:12.708 --> 1:54:14.125
But you can see...

1:54:16.583 --> 1:54:18.167
I'm not your enemy.

1:54:18.792 --> 1:54:19.750
I know.

1:54:26.708 --> 1:54:28.125
I shouldn't do this.

1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:33.042
It's wrong.

1:54:33.750 --> 1:54:34.792
I'm sorry.

1:54:36.708 --> 1:54:37.708
Pathaan?

1:54:38.125 --> 1:54:39.083
Not to you.

1:54:39.792 --> 1:54:40.708
To you!

1:54:48.333 --> 1:54:49.417
I said sorry.

1:54:55.583 --> 1:54:57.875
AFGHANISTAN

1:55:06.875 --> 1:55:07.875
All calm, General?

1:55:08.208 --> 1:55:10.667
I don't want calm, I want havoc.

1:55:11.750 --> 1:55:13.458
India will not give Kashmir, General.

1:55:13.958 --> 1:55:14.875
So...

1:55:15.792 --> 1:55:17.000
do we teach them a lesson?

1:55:22.917 --> 1:55:23.958
The missile is ready.

1:55:24.125 --> 1:55:27.000
You just have to press the button
and I have to get paid.

1:55:27.250 --> 1:55:28.167
Then...

1:55:28.250 --> 1:55:29.167
boom!

1:55:32.083 --> 1:55:33.083
ENTER AMOUNT

1:55:35.833 --> 1:55:36.750
General!

1:55:37.583 --> 1:55:38.500
Sir.

1:55:40.083 --> 1:55:44.125
Everyone in my village
was struck by a strange disease.

1:55:44.292 --> 1:55:46.833
They're all dead now.

1:55:47.125 --> 1:55:49.042
A metal ball fell here and no one
survived after that.

1:55:49.250 --> 1:55:50.542
What are they saying?

1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.667
The video is from an Afghan village,
some 200 kms away.

1:55:53.958 --> 1:55:55.792
The local TV is saying...

1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:57.875
a strange virus is spreading
through the village.

1:55:58.375 --> 1:55:59.625
It has the same symptoms as...

1:56:02.125 --> 1:56:03.667
smallpox.

1:56:06.917 --> 1:56:07.875
That's...

1:56:08.958 --> 1:56:09.958
that's impossible.

1:56:11.042 --> 1:56:12.042
Raktbeej.

1:56:14.042 --> 1:56:15.542
How can it be Raktbeej?

1:56:16.875 --> 1:56:18.000
One orb is on the missile...

1:56:20.292 --> 1:56:21.875
and the other was destroyed in India.

1:56:23.208 --> 1:56:24.708
Either you're a fool...

1:56:26.458 --> 1:56:28.375
or you think I am.

1:56:29.625 --> 1:56:30.958
If you want all your money,

1:56:31.042 --> 1:56:34.875
find out how this other Raktbeej
landed there.

1:56:39.500 --> 1:56:42.833
You're mistaken
if you think I'm your friend...

1:56:44.083 --> 1:56:46.458
or that I have sympathy towards Pakistan.

1:56:46.958 --> 1:56:48.708
Or that I need money.

1:56:49.292 --> 1:56:50.917
You haven't understood me, General.

1:56:52.417 --> 1:56:55.958
I am the demon Raktbeej.

1:56:56.042 --> 1:56:57.500
Leave me!

1:56:57.667 --> 1:57:00.167
If you want to see a free show,
why pick on Delhi?

1:57:01.625 --> 1:57:02.583
Change the co-ordinates.

1:57:04.792 --> 1:57:06.875
Let's party in Islamabad.

1:57:06.958 --> 1:57:10.583
No, sorry. I'm sorry. Don't do that.

1:57:14.792 --> 1:57:16.083
You handle it
yourself, right?

1:57:18.458 --> 1:57:19.833
Exactly as you told me.

1:57:20.458 --> 1:57:21.792
I don't know where it came from.

1:57:25.083 --> 1:57:26.208
Find out what's going on.

1:57:27.250 --> 1:57:28.458
Who's behind this?

1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:30.917
I want the answer...

1:57:32.500 --> 1:57:33.583
and his head.

1:57:35.417 --> 1:57:36.375
I want both.

1:58:04.167 --> 1:58:05.083
How?

1:58:06.042 --> 1:58:06.958
Welcome!

1:58:14.542 --> 1:58:15.542
To my home!

1:58:17.333 --> 1:58:18.792
This is my Afghan family.

1:58:19.833 --> 1:58:20.750
My people.

1:58:23.333 --> 1:58:24.667
Our Pathaan.

1:58:44.958 --> 1:58:45.875
What did you find there?

1:58:46.333 --> 1:58:47.708
The man who stands before you.

1:58:52.208 --> 1:58:53.167
Pathaan.

1:59:03.625 --> 1:59:05.250
You have this nasty habit.

1:59:06.250 --> 1:59:08.708
You smell a party and arrive uninvited.

1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:10.958
Never ever invited to a bash,

1:59:12.333 --> 1:59:13.292
Pathaan just loves to gatecrash.

1:59:14.042 --> 1:59:15.958
If you have a party in Pathaan's home,

1:59:16.917 --> 1:59:19.125
he has to be there to welcome you...

1:59:21.250 --> 1:59:22.708
with some fireworks.

1:59:24.417 --> 1:59:25.417
Some joke, General!

1:59:26.333 --> 1:59:30.708
Another of your agents
has fallen in love with the enemy.

1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:33.667
First there was Zoya and Tiger.

1:59:35.417 --> 1:59:36.333
And now...

1:59:41.500 --> 1:59:46.750
Has ISI turned into some
dating website for Indian agents?

1:59:46.833 --> 1:59:47.750
MISSILE STATE
UNARMED

1:59:52.333 --> 1:59:53.208
MISSILE STATE
ARMED 02:44

2:00:00.375 --> 2:00:01.625
Pathaan!

2:00:06.292 --> 2:00:08.250
Raza... Raza!

2:00:08.458 --> 2:00:09.375
Pathaan...

2:00:20.958 --> 2:00:23.375
Pathaan, Jim isn't a man to give up.

2:00:23.792 --> 2:00:24.750
There must be...

2:00:25.625 --> 2:00:26.458
Huh?

2:00:32.125 --> 2:00:32.958
-Amol!
-Sir!

2:00:33.042 --> 2:00:35.375
Amol, see if the orb
can be detached from the missile.

2:00:35.458 --> 2:00:36.417
Yes, sir!
- Duck!

2:00:38.708 --> 2:00:39.708
Let's do this, man.

2:00:40.167 --> 2:00:41.083
MISSILE STATE
ARMED 01:49

2:00:42.333 --> 2:00:44.208
I'll deactivate the missile.

2:04:26.583 --> 2:04:27.542
Where's the orb?

2:04:28.167 --> 2:04:30.750
Pathaan, the missile
was only a diversion.

2:04:31.167 --> 2:04:32.667
The real Raktbeej isn't here.

2:04:34.583 --> 2:04:36.333
Jim had another plan all along.

2:05:12.250 --> 2:05:13.250
Where is Raktbeej?

2:05:13.708 --> 2:05:14.792
What is Jim's real plan?

2:05:14.875 --> 2:05:16.750
-You traitor, I will--
-

2:05:17.292 --> 2:05:18.292
Wait! Wait!

2:05:18.875 --> 2:05:20.583
Only Sergei knows.

2:05:21.125 --> 2:05:21.958
Sergei.

2:05:39.125 --> 2:05:40.458
Flight LT-72.

2:05:49.792 --> 2:05:52.708
Pathaan and
Colonel Luthra, listen to me.

2:05:52.875 --> 2:05:54.125
Raktbeej is on a plane.

2:05:54.875 --> 2:05:57.458
Flight LT-72.
It's circling Delhi right now.

2:05:58.375 --> 2:06:01.792
There's a way to deactivate the orb...

2:06:02.667 --> 2:06:03.625
and only Jim knows how.

2:06:03.708 --> 2:06:05.792
Connect me to air traffic control. Now!

2:06:08.708 --> 2:06:10.833
-Pathaan, find Jim.
- Yeah...

2:06:11.375 --> 2:06:12.208
Yes.

2:06:30.083 --> 2:06:31.917
Flight LT-72, do you hear me?

2:06:32.333 --> 2:06:35.625
Ground Air Control,
this is Captain Mehra from Flight LT-72.

2:06:35.708 --> 2:06:38.792
Landing permission denied.
I repeat, landing permission denied.

2:06:39.042 --> 2:06:40.000
What?

2:06:47.208 --> 2:06:50.625
Raktbeej is sitting happily
in a plane over Delhi now.

2:06:52.750 --> 2:06:54.583
The orb has six minutes left.

2:06:57.542 --> 2:06:58.542
And so does Delhi.

2:06:59.958 --> 2:07:01.542
In six minutes, the virus...

2:07:02.750 --> 2:07:05.375
will spread through the plane's AC ducts.

2:07:06.208 --> 2:07:07.208
Unless...

2:07:08.583 --> 2:07:11.292
you can grab this
detonator switch from me.

2:07:13.875 --> 2:07:14.833
What a pity!

2:07:17.292 --> 2:07:18.125
It's unlikely.

2:07:25.750 --> 2:07:27.583
Captain Mehra,
this is Colonel Luthra from RAW.

2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:29.750
There's a biological weapon
on board.

2:07:30.083 --> 2:07:32.125
The device is in your AC ducts.

2:07:32.208 --> 2:07:33.042
What?

2:07:33.750 --> 2:07:36.333
What am I supposed to do, Colonel?
We're running low on fuel.

2:07:37.000 --> 2:07:38.917
Captain, you're carrying
a very dangerous weapon.

2:07:39.375 --> 2:07:41.875
Fly as far as you can
from Delhi, please.

2:08:25.750 --> 2:08:27.125
CONNECTING TO WI-FI.
CONNECTED

2:08:27.750 --> 2:08:28.833
I found it, Colonel.

2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:31.208
Only four minutes to go.

2:08:34.292 --> 2:08:35.333
Get me the minister.

2:09:00.750 --> 2:09:01.667
Yes, sir.

2:09:02.208 --> 2:09:03.542
There is no other option.

2:09:05.208 --> 2:09:06.167
Jai Hind.

2:09:07.375 --> 2:09:08.542
Connect me
to missile command.

2:09:08.625 --> 2:09:09.583
Yes, sir.

2:09:39.500 --> 2:09:42.250
Captain, we will
have to destroy the plane.

2:09:42.333 --> 2:09:44.125
There must be
another way, Colonel.

2:09:45.417 --> 2:09:49.417
I have 300 passengers
and many children on board.

2:09:52.333 --> 2:09:55.250
Right now, your plane is more
dangerous than a nuclear bomb.

2:09:55.792 --> 2:09:58.833
I'm sorry.
We... can't save you.

2:10:06.292 --> 2:10:07.250
Missile Control,

2:10:07.792 --> 2:10:09.417
initiate strike protocol.

2:10:15.667 --> 2:10:16.708
Come on, Pathaan.

2:10:18.792 --> 2:10:19.958
There's only one option.

2:10:20.708 --> 2:10:22.333
Remember how you
sacrificed your scientists?

2:10:23.458 --> 2:10:25.208
Play "Vande Mataram" on the plane

2:10:26.042 --> 2:10:27.458
and blow up the passengers.

2:10:27.708 --> 2:10:28.583
Fire.

2:10:33.417 --> 2:10:35.125
My family's lives were sacrificed.

2:10:35.792 --> 2:10:36.792
Now it's your turn to make a sacrifice.

2:11:25.750 --> 2:11:27.458
-

2:11:39.667 --> 2:11:41.125
-

2:11:53.750 --> 2:11:55.292
Farewell, Pathaan.

2:12:15.583 --> 2:12:18.500
The timer has stopped, sir.
Please stop the missile.

2:12:18.583 --> 2:12:20.292
Abort, abort, abort!

2:12:24.875 --> 2:12:26.375
Yeah!

2:12:26.750 --> 2:12:28.917
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

2:12:31.125 --> 2:12:33.125
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your Captain here.

2:12:33.208 --> 2:12:36.083
Please buckle up because
we're about to land in Delhi.

2:13:17.042 --> 2:13:18.917
You couldn't understand
something very simple, Jim.

2:13:20.542 --> 2:13:22.375
A soldier does not ask...

2:13:23.583 --> 2:13:25.042
what his country can do for him.

2:13:27.583 --> 2:13:28.583
He asks...

2:13:30.292 --> 2:13:32.458
what he can do for his country.

2:13:46.417 --> 2:13:48.375
You don't deserve this, Jim.

2:14:00.333 --> 2:14:03.500
Give your Mother India my last goodbye.

2:14:08.250 --> 2:14:09.167
Jai Hind.

2:15:00.417 --> 2:15:04.333
DIRECTOR
SIDDHARTH ANAND

2:15:04.875 --> 2:15:08.792
PRODUCER
ADITYA CHOPRA

2:15:19.708 --> 2:15:21.333
If anyone merits this medal,

2:15:22.625 --> 2:15:23.542
it's you.

2:15:24.708 --> 2:15:27.417
I've never met a braver soldier than you.

2:15:30.917 --> 2:15:31.833
Ma'am.

2:15:33.625 --> 2:15:34.458
Pathaan.

2:15:36.417 --> 2:15:38.125
Colonel, good news.

2:15:38.542 --> 2:15:39.458
I'm leaving.

2:15:39.875 --> 2:15:43.250
So you won't suffer from acidity
and blood pressure anymore.

2:15:43.667 --> 2:15:46.917
Our paths are separate now.

2:15:47.417 --> 2:15:49.583
-Thank you, sir.
-The war is not over, Pathaan.

2:15:51.542 --> 2:15:52.417
We need you.

2:15:52.792 --> 2:15:53.625
Me?

2:15:54.542 --> 2:15:55.792
But we are--

2:15:55.958 --> 2:15:58.458
What did you call us? Broken eggshells?

2:15:58.667 --> 2:16:00.625
I admit
mistakes were made, Pathaan.

2:16:02.167 --> 2:16:05.375
But this country cannot be saved
by Colonel Luthra alone.

2:16:06.625 --> 2:16:09.667
Or by Tiger or Kabir.

2:16:11.833 --> 2:16:12.958
Or even by Pathaan.

2:16:14.042 --> 2:16:15.292
Everyone is needed.

2:16:18.792 --> 2:16:21.250
There are many soldiers like them,
Pathaan.

2:16:21.792 --> 2:16:24.833
Some with wounded bodies,
others with damaged souls.

2:16:25.792 --> 2:16:30.417
But they are ready to sacrifice
their lives for this country.

2:16:31.167 --> 2:16:34.750
These broken folks can
only be put together with the gold...

2:16:37.792 --> 2:16:39.542
that has lived through fire.

2:16:42.208 --> 2:16:44.042
And that person is you.

2:16:45.458 --> 2:16:48.458
Make the sharpest sword, Pathaan,

2:16:49.167 --> 2:16:52.208
so the souls of the enemy tremble.

2:16:54.292 --> 2:16:56.208
But who will wield that sword?

2:16:56.750 --> 2:16:58.958
Who will it strike?
How will it strike?

2:17:00.208 --> 2:17:01.375
Who decides that?

2:17:02.125 --> 2:17:03.208
The sword is yours.

2:17:05.458 --> 2:17:07.083
So it is your call.

2:17:12.292 --> 2:17:14.375
Thank you.
Thank you very much, sir.

2:17:15.625 --> 2:17:17.167
Let's start.
-Yes, sir.

2:17:18.042 --> 2:17:19.375
Uh... sorry, sir.

2:17:20.417 --> 2:17:22.750
I have an urgent appointment.

2:17:23.583 --> 2:17:24.417
With whom?

2:17:25.792 --> 2:17:28.667
With... my hairdresser.

2:17:30.625 --> 2:17:31.542
Getting a haircut?

2:17:32.750 --> 2:17:33.708
No, sir.

2:17:34.917 --> 2:17:36.958
-Just shampoo.
-

2:18:59.375 --> 2:19:02.250
Gets into the groove, my love

2:19:17.667 --> 2:19:20.417
Gets into the groove, my love

2:21:12.958 --> 2:21:14.333
Can't do it anymore.

2:21:14.958 --> 2:21:16.250
Yeah.

2:21:17.375 --> 2:21:21.417
I've been thinking, it's been 30 years,
we should stop.

2:21:24.583 --> 2:21:26.292
But who'll replace us?

2:21:26.875 --> 2:21:28.000
Hmm...

2:21:33.208 --> 2:21:34.042
There's that guy.

2:21:34.917 --> 2:21:35.792
Hmm?

2:21:35.875 --> 2:21:36.792
That guy.

2:21:38.833 --> 2:21:39.708
No?

2:21:42.250 --> 2:21:43.375
What about that other guy?

2:21:44.458 --> 2:21:45.792
He has something.

2:21:46.792 --> 2:21:48.500
No, not him.

2:21:50.208 --> 2:21:51.792
He's got no style. Nah!

2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:53.042
No.

2:21:53.292 --> 2:21:54.208
Never mind.

2:21:57.250 --> 2:21:58.458
-And him?
-And him?

2:22:00.417 --> 2:22:01.750
-Nah!
-No.

2:22:02.167 --> 2:22:03.208
No.

2:22:05.250 --> 2:22:06.500
No.

2:22:08.583 --> 2:22:10.375
-It's up to us, Bhai.
-Hmm.

2:22:10.917 --> 2:22:11.917
Our country is at stake.

2:22:12.542 --> 2:22:14.125
We can't leave it to kids.

2:22:15.792 --> 2:22:17.625
Come on. Let's go.

2:22:18.417 --> 2:22:21.167
Help me up. Lift me up.

2:22:22.875 --> 2:22:23.875
Lower back.
