03:35.749 --> 03:39.440
Why don't you call Peggy?
She can come watch TV with you.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.527
That show that you like
is on tonight, isn't it?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.213
Hey, cutie.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.671
What's the name of it?

03:47.928 --> 03:50.942
Come on, Linda.
You're making me feel very guilty.

03:52.032 --> 03:55.122
It's just for a couple of hours.
I deserve this.

03:55.202 --> 03:57.037
I haven't been out for three months.

03:57.872 --> 04:02.548
Three months. That's exactly how long
it's been since I've been out.

04:05.146 --> 04:07.709
Looks like Mike almost has
his date for tonight.

04:12.053 --> 04:13.642
Nobody is taking dates.

04:13.722 --> 04:16.399
It's a bunch of guys going
to a boxing match, that's it.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.132
What?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.763
Why are you looking at me like that?

04:23.898 --> 04:25.320
'Cause I know your friends.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.088
They have the hormones of high school kids.

04:27.168 --> 04:28.657
Don't accuse me of running around.

04:28.737 --> 04:31.360
You're the only one
of your friends with a family.

04:31.440 --> 04:34.296
I think it's time you start
hanging out with grownups.

04:34.376 --> 04:35.754
My friends are grownups.

04:36.778 --> 04:37.900
Sorry.

04:37.980 --> 04:40.002
MAN, OVER P.A.:
If you look out of the starboard side...

04:40.082 --> 04:42.939
- What the hell is that?
- ...the aging but potentially dangerous...

04:43.019 --> 04:44.507
Mr. Frank Wyatt!

04:44.587 --> 04:47.843
Not since the turn of the century
has he come on vacations with us.

04:47.923 --> 04:50.180
Let's dust him off
and give him some applause.

04:50.260 --> 04:52.515
There's one of your grown-up friends.

04:52.595 --> 04:53.883
I got to go.

04:53.963 --> 04:55.136
Go.

04:56.599 --> 04:57.887
Go and have some fun.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.610
Maybe you'll stop walking around
with that look on your face.

05:03.939 --> 05:08.244
- Say bye.
- I have no regrets, okay?

05:09.111 --> 05:10.615
Whatever you say.

05:13.616 --> 05:15.848
Bye, gorgeous. Daddy's got to go.

05:18.455 --> 05:19.799
I love you.

05:20.557 --> 05:22.185
MAN, OVER P.A.: Oh, excuse me.

05:22.859 --> 05:24.215
I love you, too.

05:24.295 --> 05:25.949
MAN, OVER P.A.:
We've got some family values exhibition.

05:26.029 --> 05:27.499
I'll be home early.

05:28.265 --> 05:30.793
Yeah, Linda, say around 8:00 a.m.

05:32.736 --> 05:35.058
Thanks. I'm on the couch tonight for sure.

05:35.138 --> 05:37.228
- She hates me.
- She does not hate you.

05:37.308 --> 05:38.829
We've been married for two years...

05:38.909 --> 05:40.470
Remember your birthday?

05:43.647 --> 05:45.150
She hates you.

05:48.218 --> 05:50.807
I'll get rid of them and come back to you.

05:50.887 --> 05:51.975
Promise?

05:52.055 --> 05:54.493
Check it out inside.
It's bigger than your house.

05:56.693 --> 05:58.649
Prepare to have your
pleasure glands carpet bombed.

05:58.729 --> 06:01.008
Watch out for the floors
because they're marble.

06:06.838 --> 06:08.893
Cool system.

06:10.475 --> 06:13.242
Don't touch anything.

06:14.245 --> 06:15.658
That's not right for you.

06:15.747 --> 06:18.436
Don't put your dirty dogs
on my clean upholstery, either.

06:18.516 --> 06:20.472
Ray, where the hell did you get this thing?

06:20.552 --> 06:22.106
- I promoted it.
- What?

06:22.186 --> 06:25.443
I conned the dealer into letting
me take it out for the evening.

06:25.523 --> 06:26.811
How did you do that?

06:26.891 --> 06:29.614
Driving past the dealership,
I spotted this beast.

06:29.694 --> 06:32.950
I go inside and say, "This baby
is perfect for entertaining clients.

06:33.030 --> 06:37.121
"I was thinking about using it to buy
a few of them for my sales force."

06:37.201 --> 06:40.292
He begged me to take it out.
It was embarrassing.

06:40.372 --> 06:42.867
Wait. Your sales force?

06:43.542 --> 06:45.298
I may have some. I will.

06:45.378 --> 06:49.902
Tomorrow I'll return it and say, "Thank you,
"but under very careful consideration,

06:49.982 --> 06:51.970
"I would have to say it's not big enough.

06:52.050 --> 06:53.972
"I need an airbag in the bathroom...

06:54.052 --> 06:56.045
"and I'll see you."

06:57.055 --> 07:00.005
Ray Cochran... the man, the myth.

07:01.994 --> 07:03.148
Yes, indeed.

07:03.228 --> 07:04.550
We're running late. Where's Eddie?

07:04.630 --> 07:06.485
Eddie couldn't make it. He canceled.

07:06.565 --> 07:10.355
- I invited someone else.
- Who'd you invite?

07:14.072 --> 07:15.815
Who's the crash-test dummy?

07:18.210 --> 07:19.665
That's your little brother.

07:19.745 --> 07:22.068
Ray, don't start.

07:22.148 --> 07:24.204
Linda's been busting my balls
since I got home.

07:24.284 --> 07:26.172
Give him a break.

07:26.252 --> 07:27.807
John's a good guy.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.709
He's a pain in the ass.

07:29.789 --> 07:33.112
Every time you guys get together
it's like a slugfest.

07:33.192 --> 07:35.315
- That's not true.
- It's not true?

07:35.395 --> 07:37.384
He doesn't anger you when you get together?

07:37.464 --> 07:39.519
He's my brother, and I invited him.

07:39.599 --> 07:41.945
- Hey, Rayzor Man.
- That's cool.

07:42.769 --> 07:45.492
It's nice. What the hell is this thing?

07:45.572 --> 07:46.960
Just get in.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.695
Looks like Barbie's playhouse.

07:48.775 --> 07:51.665
You should know.
You're the one who plays with dolls.

07:51.745 --> 07:53.214
Where you been, buddy?

07:54.281 --> 07:56.603
Jesus, look at this thing.

07:56.683 --> 07:57.913
Yo, bro.

07:59.185 --> 08:02.008
My big brother actually
invites me to go somewhere?

08:02.088 --> 08:05.913
- You sick or something?
- You're late, as usual.

08:05.993 --> 08:08.716
What do you say, fight fans?

08:08.796 --> 08:11.018
Open some libations,
and let's get on the road.

08:11.098 --> 08:12.620
Beers are in the fridge.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.237
Beer.

08:15.636 --> 08:17.892
Let's hit it. All aboard!

08:17.972 --> 08:19.994
That's a conductor, not a bus driver.

08:20.074 --> 08:21.329
Sit down and shut up.

08:21.409 --> 08:22.897
That's a bus driver.

08:22.977 --> 08:24.732
Let me see your transfer.

08:24.812 --> 08:26.801
When have you ever been on a bus?

08:26.881 --> 08:28.829
I've seen a few.

08:43.230 --> 08:44.753
I got 600 on Davis.

08:44.833 --> 08:49.258
What? You idiot, Davis rhymes with "save us!"

08:49.338 --> 08:51.727
You should have given the money to us.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.095
We should have left earlier.
We'll miss the prelim.

08:54.175 --> 08:56.832
The Rayzor Man will not let you down.

08:56.912 --> 09:00.124
I don't intend to miss
one single, solitary punch.

09:01.383 --> 09:03.104
Where did this kid come from?

09:03.184 --> 09:05.574
Your boy's about to get beat.

09:05.654 --> 09:07.343
Bob and weave! Look at that.

09:07.423 --> 09:10.224
Thank God this thing has a satellite dish.

09:11.192 --> 09:13.282
Much better than sitting ringside.

09:13.362 --> 09:15.351
Much, much better.

09:15.431 --> 09:17.619
Another day in front of the boob tube.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.788
We'll be so close, we'll get blood on us.

09:19.868 --> 09:23.625
Coming from our noses,
the seats will be so high in the rafters.

09:23.705 --> 09:25.127
Give me a break.

09:25.207 --> 09:26.882
Oh, shit.

09:28.144 --> 09:29.591
Look at him!

09:30.580 --> 09:32.026
Hit him!

09:34.717 --> 09:36.186
Hell, yeah. Look at him go.

09:39.856 --> 09:42.078
See his feet? His legs are buckling.

09:42.158 --> 09:43.646
It's over.

09:43.726 --> 09:45.815
Betting on the other guy.

09:45.895 --> 09:49.151
Hernandez and that Martinez kid
won't last three rounds.

09:49.231 --> 09:51.454
We're gonna miss the main event.

09:51.534 --> 09:53.256
Mike's right. We should just settle in...

09:53.336 --> 09:55.492
Bullshit. We're not going to miss anything.

09:55.572 --> 09:56.593
Shut that TV off.

09:56.673 --> 09:58.828
Ray, take it easy.

09:58.908 --> 10:01.038
Do you want to make it to the fight?

10:14.925 --> 10:16.270
Shit.

10:18.596 --> 10:20.703
I don't believe this. He won't let me in.

10:21.899 --> 10:23.854
How about it? Can we get in?

10:23.934 --> 10:25.856
- How about what?
- Can we get over?

10:25.936 --> 10:28.592
Wait your turn like everyone else, asshole.

10:28.672 --> 10:30.361
Forget it. Hey, stop!

10:30.441 --> 10:32.480
Going to let us over?

10:33.010 --> 10:34.532
We're going to hit him!

10:34.612 --> 10:36.734
This guy's not stopping. Back off already.

10:36.814 --> 10:38.802
I'm not gonna back off.

10:38.882 --> 10:40.875
Back off! He's not stopping!

10:41.452 --> 10:43.407
Look out!

10:43.487 --> 10:46.163
This guy just hit me.

10:49.961 --> 10:51.683
Fuck you! What are you doing?

10:51.763 --> 10:53.756
Fuck you! You want some? Come on!

10:57.168 --> 10:58.290
Round one!

10:58.370 --> 11:00.792
Let's see something,
you little fucking weasel.

11:00.872 --> 11:02.093
Let's see what you got.

11:02.173 --> 11:04.729
- Get off me!
- Not tonight!

11:04.809 --> 11:06.064
I didn't think so.

11:06.144 --> 11:07.566
I can take this motherfucker!

11:07.646 --> 11:08.800
What?

11:08.880 --> 11:09.968
Fuck you!

11:10.048 --> 11:11.203
Come on, John Boy!

11:11.283 --> 11:13.372
I'll beat the shit out of both of you!

11:13.452 --> 11:14.989
What's this? What do you got...

11:17.856 --> 11:19.360
It hurts?

11:20.224 --> 11:21.713
Leave him alone.

11:21.793 --> 11:25.495
Yeah, relax. Take the pretty girl home.

11:26.130 --> 11:27.577
Unless you want me to.

11:30.370 --> 11:31.891
I can't hear you. I'm sorry.

11:31.971 --> 11:33.167
All right.

11:40.646 --> 11:41.910
You're not worth it.

11:44.784 --> 11:47.016
- Nice job, buddy.
- Shut up!

11:51.023 --> 11:52.402
Way to go, tough guy.

11:54.527 --> 11:56.907
I can't believe people in this fucking town.

11:57.863 --> 11:59.952
Married life making you soft?

12:00.032 --> 12:03.130
Once, your brother would have
dumped that guy on his ass.

12:07.373 --> 12:08.794
What is the matter with you?

12:08.874 --> 12:11.465
You can't fight every asshole
that looks at you funny.

12:11.545 --> 12:13.767
There's a lot of craziness
going on out there.

12:13.847 --> 12:15.769
You never know who's gonna pull a gun...

12:15.849 --> 12:17.304
and blow your goddamn brains out.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.640
It happens every day! You listen to me!

12:19.720 --> 12:23.182
What, Frank? What are you going to do?

12:24.925 --> 12:26.554
You're not my father.

12:29.596 --> 12:32.580
Way to go, little man. You showed some heart.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.489
What did I say? What did I tell you?

12:35.569 --> 12:37.324
- Remember what I said?
- I'm sorry.

12:37.404 --> 12:39.568
Don't encourage him with that macho shit!

12:41.508 --> 12:42.738
He's right, you know.

12:44.244 --> 12:45.543
About what?

12:47.914 --> 12:49.748
You're not his father, bro.

12:53.054 --> 12:54.709
That was really smart, baby brother.

12:54.789 --> 12:56.211
Hey, enough, Ray.

12:56.291 --> 12:57.879
Stop acting like you're three.

12:57.959 --> 12:59.681
Why do you say shit like that?

12:59.761 --> 13:01.015
Let's knock it off.

13:01.095 --> 13:03.738
I want to have a good fucking time tonight!

13:04.766 --> 13:06.475
Hold on. We're getting out of here.

13:09.170 --> 13:10.625
What the hell are you doing?

13:10.705 --> 13:13.233
I'm not going to miss this fight.

13:15.777 --> 13:17.565
I hate being late!

13:17.645 --> 13:19.627
Wait, a cop! I'm joking.

13:26.954 --> 13:29.358
Ray's the man! Do it!

13:52.080 --> 13:55.003
Here's to me and those like me...

13:55.083 --> 13:56.905
because very few were made.

13:56.985 --> 13:58.574
Thank God.

13:58.654 --> 14:02.044
This is an extraordinary piece
of navigation, my brother.

14:02.124 --> 14:04.079
Do you know how to get there?

14:04.159 --> 14:06.081
We double back around the expressway.

14:06.161 --> 14:07.506
How hard can it be?

14:19.008 --> 14:22.399
I bet there's some tremendous
real estate bargains down here.

14:22.479 --> 14:25.402
That's great, but where's
the damn expressway?

14:25.482 --> 14:27.704
Enough of this scenic route.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.606
They built the expressway logically.

14:29.686 --> 14:31.725
We hit the next intersection and cut over.

14:38.495 --> 14:40.817
I don't see any signs or anything.

14:40.897 --> 14:46.122
If I can cross over the one-way
street we exited on, we'll be fine.

14:46.202 --> 14:49.125
We've been around
this block a thousand times.

14:49.205 --> 14:52.372
We'll just cross the street,
and we'll be fine.

14:54.312 --> 14:56.213
You have no clue where you're going.

14:57.047 --> 14:58.603
A little faith, my friends.

14:58.683 --> 14:59.904
We have never been here.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.872
Look. The Brothers Johnson.

15:01.952 --> 15:04.074
I'm just being logical, right?

15:04.154 --> 15:06.477
When you're lost, you ask for directions.

15:06.557 --> 15:09.179
Let's ask those guys.
They know their way around.

15:09.259 --> 15:12.650
We'll say we're the Welcome Wagon,
and we have some baked goods for them.

15:12.730 --> 15:14.719
Excuse me. Gentlemen.

15:14.799 --> 15:16.487
, OVER P.A. We're the Welcome Wagon.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.656
Can you come here, please?

15:18.736 --> 15:21.659
Mr. Welcome would like to ask you something.

15:21.739 --> 15:24.195
Give me that. You know what, it's not funny.

15:24.275 --> 15:25.863
Here they come.

15:25.943 --> 15:27.481
They're coming to party, baby.

15:29.246 --> 15:30.368
How are you?

15:30.448 --> 15:32.637
Show them what you got. Check it out.

15:32.717 --> 15:34.461
- Watch this.
- Shit.

15:35.754 --> 15:37.309
What the hell are you doing?

15:37.389 --> 15:38.494
Let him have it.

15:42.494 --> 15:45.136
How is that funny? I don't get it!

15:47.265 --> 15:49.373
Just get us back on the expressway.

15:53.272 --> 15:55.026
- Lock the doors.
- You got the gun.

15:55.106 --> 15:56.995
Anybody comes to the door, blow them away.

15:57.075 --> 15:59.365
- Just lock the doors.
- I'll lock the goddamned door.

15:59.445 --> 16:02.543
I don't even know
if I'm insured on this thing.

16:05.984 --> 16:08.240
You really know how to
use this thing, Rayzor?

16:08.320 --> 16:10.632
Beretta nine millimeter. Shit happens, man.

16:11.923 --> 16:13.044
You were right.

16:13.124 --> 16:15.146
You never know what maniac's
gonna pull out a gun.

16:15.226 --> 16:17.301
The only maniac I know is you.

16:19.299 --> 16:22.222
You know what we need?
We need a frigging map.

16:22.302 --> 16:24.090
Who carries a map?

16:24.170 --> 16:27.927
Thousands of unarmed people
who drive Hyundais carry maps.

16:28.007 --> 16:29.989
How about getting us out of here?

16:35.147 --> 16:38.438
I think there's a map
in the glove compartment.

16:38.518 --> 16:41.320
- Right here?
- To the right of it.

16:43.222 --> 16:45.717
Here it is. You're closer than I am.

16:51.331 --> 16:53.085
What was that?

16:53.165 --> 16:55.187
I don't know. I think we hit something.

16:55.267 --> 16:57.136
Maybe a dog or something.

16:58.439 --> 16:59.510
No, we didn't.

17:01.041 --> 17:04.832
I felt it. I think we hit someone.

17:04.912 --> 17:07.768
You know where the hell we are?
They're scam artists.

17:07.848 --> 17:09.436
They make a living doing this.

17:09.517 --> 17:11.020
Doing what?

17:11.852 --> 17:15.064
They pretend to get hit
and blow your head off.

17:16.424 --> 17:18.018
Somebody might be hurt.

17:20.227 --> 17:23.359
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna check it out.

17:27.134 --> 17:29.557
You guys doing the Mother Teresa Show?

17:29.637 --> 17:31.346
Wait.

18:01.603 --> 18:02.947
Nothing down here.

18:28.598 --> 18:29.771
He's dead.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.129
Think again, asshole.

18:41.644 --> 18:42.942
It's gonna be all right.

18:44.146 --> 18:45.343
What's happening?

18:45.948 --> 18:48.625
We hit somebody. Call 911!

18:49.819 --> 18:51.619
Oh, my God. I don't believe it.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.543
911 emergency.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.745
- How long will it be?
- The phone's dead.

19:28.825 --> 19:31.502
There's no service
in this shit-hole part of town.

19:32.329 --> 19:34.322
Let's get him to an emergency room.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.342
How do you work this?

19:42.206 --> 19:44.929
I didn't see him. He came out of nowhere.

19:45.009 --> 19:46.513
It wasn't my fault.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.160
Hey, bring him into the RV.

20:07.932 --> 20:10.039
Is he okay?

20:14.872 --> 20:17.788
Easy. Careful.

20:31.357 --> 20:33.065
Get a towel.

20:37.963 --> 20:39.638
He's been shot.

20:41.099 --> 20:42.272
Put this under his...

20:44.002 --> 20:46.531
Careful. Easy.

20:54.847 --> 20:56.259
He's a thief.

20:56.915 --> 20:59.505
The cops probably shot him.
They'll be back any minute.

20:59.585 --> 21:00.806
Who shot you?

21:00.886 --> 21:02.040
Leave him alone.

21:02.120 --> 21:03.877
Goddamn it, somebody shot him!

21:03.957 --> 21:05.612
We could all be in danger.

21:05.692 --> 21:07.281
We're not leaving him here.

21:07.361 --> 21:09.516
I've had a lot to drink tonight.

21:09.596 --> 21:12.352
What's your problem? The kid is hurt.

21:12.432 --> 21:14.688
Want me to go to prison because of him?

21:14.768 --> 21:17.524
- It is not our concern.
- Yes, it is.

21:17.604 --> 21:19.693
They're coming after me. You got to help me.

21:19.773 --> 21:22.729
- We won't let anybody hurt you.
- Get me out of here!

21:22.809 --> 21:26.800
Shut up! Goddamn it!
I can't hear myself think!

21:26.880 --> 21:29.403
Who the hell are you telling to shut up?

21:29.483 --> 21:31.170
Listen.

21:33.353 --> 21:35.242
You can't tell them about the money.

21:35.322 --> 21:38.778
Don't worry. It's going to be fine.

21:38.858 --> 21:40.453
That's not what I'm worried about.

21:42.362 --> 21:44.285
- There they go!
- They didn't see us.

21:44.365 --> 21:45.753
We got to catch them.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.555
We should get our story straight.

21:47.635 --> 21:50.403
- If you won't drive, I will.
- Get the door! Let's go!

21:56.577 --> 21:57.875
Get out of the way.

22:03.684 --> 22:05.072
There they go!

22:05.152 --> 22:10.077
Hey, help! Police! We got somebody shot!

22:10.157 --> 22:11.627
They turned the corner.

22:22.770 --> 22:23.858
Take it easy.

22:23.938 --> 22:25.237
Where the hell are they?

22:57.939 --> 23:00.195
Ray, you okay?

23:00.275 --> 23:01.963
I'm all right. You all right, Frank?

23:02.043 --> 23:03.216
Yeah.

23:25.602 --> 23:26.756
What the hell hit us?

23:26.836 --> 23:28.625
My guess?

23:28.705 --> 23:31.661
Probably some no-insurance,
car-driving asshole...

23:31.741 --> 23:34.019
bashed into us in a fucking junker.

23:35.412 --> 23:37.400
Un-fucking-believable.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.758
- Ray, calm down.
- Calm down?

23:40.483 --> 23:42.239
This will cost me a fortune.

23:42.319 --> 23:44.674
I'm now the proud owner
of a little fax machine.

23:44.754 --> 23:48.279
Gonna fax myself. Might be nice for me.

23:48.359 --> 23:51.982
Large screen, brand-new, piece-of-shit TV.

23:52.062 --> 23:53.235
This'll be mine.

23:54.698 --> 23:57.044
- You okay, brother?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

24:05.175 --> 24:06.930
We're stuck in here.

24:07.010 --> 24:08.499
We're stuck, okay?

24:08.579 --> 24:10.968
We're stuck in this piece of shit
which I now own!

24:11.048 --> 24:13.281
This piece of fucking shit!

24:15.786 --> 24:17.016
Calm down!

24:19.089 --> 24:20.627
Try and start this thing.

24:22.460 --> 24:24.134
Get a window open or something.

24:25.696 --> 24:28.720
Damn thing's stuck. Great. Wonderful.

24:32.404 --> 24:33.825
It's dead.

24:33.905 --> 24:35.466
We're not going anywhere.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.733
They're out there.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.702
Who are you talking about? Who's out there?

24:43.782 --> 24:45.271
You guys don't know what you're messing with.

24:45.351 --> 24:46.872
We got to get out of here!

24:46.952 --> 24:49.808
Shut up! We're doing the best we can.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.358
Quiet.

24:54.192 --> 24:55.821
Hear that?

25:01.933 --> 25:03.608
I'm going to take a look around.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.679
Don't do that. They'll blow your head off.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.641
Ray, get the gun.

25:13.212 --> 25:14.682
Get the fucking gun.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.273
- It's gone.
- What?

25:20.353 --> 25:22.141
- It fell out when we hit.
- Then find it.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.310
It's got to be somewhere around here.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.383
- Look for it.
- I'm looking, man.

25:41.741 --> 25:42.880
You see anything?

25:45.678 --> 25:46.851
Nothing.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.141
It seems okay.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.600
We can all squeeze through there...

25:57.924 --> 25:59.613
What up, Teddy? Playing hide-and-seek?

25:59.693 --> 26:02.316
Come on out. Come here, motherfucker.

26:02.396 --> 26:05.710
Back the fuck off, please.

26:07.267 --> 26:08.689
You getting tough with me, kid?

26:08.769 --> 26:10.067
You want to keep him?

26:12.238 --> 26:14.027
Back off. You ain't got no balls.

26:14.107 --> 26:17.898
You children sit tight,
and no one will get hurt.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.425
Crack a window.

26:29.055 --> 26:30.525
This thing isn't working.

26:33.027 --> 26:34.929
You said there was no service.

26:40.935 --> 26:44.692
Look. Sykes, look, no.

26:44.772 --> 26:46.070
Shh.

26:51.979 --> 26:54.135
This is crazy. Sykes, you know me.

26:54.215 --> 26:56.704
- You see, Teddy, the problem is...
- No problem, man.

26:56.784 --> 26:58.379
You broke one of his rules.

26:59.554 --> 27:01.643
It's not like that. I didn't do anything.

27:01.723 --> 27:02.844
Just tell Fallon!

27:02.924 --> 27:05.046
- That's all I'm asking!
- Tell Fallon what?

27:05.126 --> 27:06.994
Well, go ahead. Tell him.

27:08.162 --> 27:10.385
It's not what you think.

27:10.465 --> 27:13.689
I wasn't running. You got it wrong.

27:13.769 --> 27:15.224
I got all the money right there.

27:15.304 --> 27:18.014
You can count it.

27:21.477 --> 27:22.923
How could you steal from me?

27:23.479 --> 27:25.034
I wasn't stealing from you.

27:25.114 --> 27:26.836
It's right there. All the money.

27:26.916 --> 27:30.906
Only thing I hate worse
than a thief is a liar, Teddy.

27:30.986 --> 27:34.961
You broke rule number one:
do not steal from me.

27:35.491 --> 27:37.012
What you thinking about, Teddy?

27:37.092 --> 27:39.549
Look, come on, we grew up.

27:39.629 --> 27:41.917
All you had to do was
keep the merchandise moving.

27:41.997 --> 27:43.952
No company car? Not long enough lunches?

27:44.032 --> 27:45.788
We can't just sit here.

27:45.868 --> 27:49.024
We're not going to do anything, Frank?

27:49.104 --> 27:50.660
We're not going to do one fucking thing?

27:50.740 --> 27:53.018
What do you want us to do?

27:56.680 --> 28:01.438
Did you mention my name
to the guys in the truck?

28:01.518 --> 28:04.073
I didn't say anything.

28:04.153 --> 28:06.226
I wouldn't rat you out or say shit!

28:08.358 --> 28:10.947
So you want me to let you go?

28:11.027 --> 28:13.717
Then I'm supposed to
conduct business on the street?

28:13.797 --> 28:15.785
Who's going to know, right?

28:15.865 --> 28:17.554
Nobody's going to tell.

28:17.634 --> 28:19.490
- He's not gonna tell. I'm not.
- That's right.

28:19.570 --> 28:22.041
No! Come on! All you got to do is...

28:41.859 --> 28:44.900
- We got another problem.
- How many guys in the truck?

28:45.730 --> 28:47.218
About four.

28:47.298 --> 28:50.288
North Shore plates, too. Just great.

28:50.368 --> 28:53.864
Well, boys, rule number two: no witnesses.

28:58.976 --> 29:00.321
Come on!

29:03.014 --> 29:04.187
We're next!

29:25.937 --> 29:27.192
Come on, Ray!

29:27.272 --> 29:28.867
What the hell are you doing?

29:35.280 --> 29:37.569
Where do these guys think they're going?

30:16.823 --> 30:17.996
Shit.

30:20.660 --> 30:22.081
Sorry, man.

30:22.161 --> 30:23.938
It's not what I had in mind.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.355
Thanks. That's what I'll tell the dealer.

30:28.435 --> 30:31.867
You won't be telling him nothing
unless we get out of here.

30:32.906 --> 30:35.262
That was great. Do it again.

30:35.342 --> 30:36.429
That's not funny.

30:36.509 --> 30:38.933
Hey, man, that was funny.

30:39.013 --> 30:41.542
Shit looks like the Hindenburg. Come on.

31:13.013 --> 31:14.186
Let's go, Ray.

31:40.241 --> 31:41.415
Stop.

31:45.380 --> 31:46.724
Where we heading?

31:51.753 --> 31:53.675
John, you all right?

31:53.755 --> 31:55.644
Why? Why'd they do it?

31:55.724 --> 31:57.136
They killed him.

32:00.930 --> 32:03.425
I don't think they'll follow us.
They won't do that.

32:04.467 --> 32:07.599
We saw them shoot that kid.
We were witnesses.

32:10.773 --> 32:12.368
Where the hell are we?

32:15.545 --> 32:17.500
Why'd you get off the expressway?

32:17.580 --> 32:19.802
Are we at the blaming stage now?

32:19.882 --> 32:22.798
I don't remember twisting your arm
to get off the expressway.

33:21.345 --> 33:23.268
Did they see us?

33:23.348 --> 33:25.842
I don't know. I don't think so.

33:41.866 --> 33:43.021
Frank was right.

33:43.101 --> 33:45.490
- They do want to kill us.
- I never said that.

33:45.570 --> 33:47.734
- What are we gonna do?
- Shut up.

33:52.877 --> 33:54.533
Look what the cat drug in.

33:54.613 --> 33:56.067
Keep your voice down.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.651
Hello, ladies.

33:58.650 --> 34:00.393
What do you think of the neighborhood?

34:03.856 --> 34:07.813
We call these condos down here. Nice, huh?

34:07.893 --> 34:12.150
Could be just like one of those
North Shore suburbs.

34:12.231 --> 34:16.411
Guess what. I knew you guys
would come straight here.

34:16.569 --> 34:18.558
You didn't pass "Go."

34:18.638 --> 34:20.415
So technically...

34:23.376 --> 34:24.897
You just sit tight.

34:24.976 --> 34:29.442
I'm coming door-to-door
like the goddamn Avon lady.

34:30.849 --> 34:34.426
By the way, you fucked up my car...

34:35.420 --> 34:36.924
and I don't have collision.

34:38.255 --> 34:44.099
Guy sounds like he wants to
do you bodily harm or something.

34:47.534 --> 34:50.023
I'm a college graduate.

34:50.103 --> 34:51.391
That's Buck.

34:51.471 --> 34:53.817
He's got the brain of a chicken.

34:56.510 --> 34:59.392
Sure would be a shame
if he heard you in here!

35:02.582 --> 35:04.290
Damn shame.

35:07.854 --> 35:10.644
They'd shoot us and then blow your heads off.

35:10.724 --> 35:12.467
I don't think so.

35:13.460 --> 35:17.640
Might even be grateful.
Might give us a reward.

35:19.866 --> 35:24.285
All right, goddamn it. Name your price.

35:27.007 --> 35:32.121
Gee, Mr. Businessman,
what did you have in mind?

35:37.385 --> 35:38.558
Don't move!

35:41.623 --> 35:43.160
Don't whisper.

35:44.826 --> 35:46.819
Don't even breathe.

35:53.835 --> 35:58.859
Don't you hate it when you try to be quiet,

35:58.939 --> 36:06.651
and every sound seems to be
amplified 20 or 30 times?

36:11.086 --> 36:12.282
What is that?

36:14.657 --> 36:15.811
What's that smell?

36:15.891 --> 36:17.486
You guys wearing cologne?

36:17.593 --> 36:20.087
Or is that fear?

36:29.872 --> 36:33.084
- Nice watch.
- Go to hell.

36:35.411 --> 36:37.299
Already there.

36:37.379 --> 36:40.055
Ray, give it to him.

37:11.681 --> 37:13.770
Lucy...

37:13.850 --> 37:15.388
I'm home!

37:16.686 --> 37:18.759
You got some explaining to do.

37:38.108 --> 37:39.612
Don't touch me.

37:42.079 --> 37:43.708
Don't be stupid, John.

38:14.346 --> 38:15.417
It's all I got.

38:25.256 --> 38:28.914
You guys are really starting to piss me off.

38:28.994 --> 38:31.417
This is eating into my drinking time.

38:31.497 --> 38:33.385
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

38:33.465 --> 38:37.622
Since I'm a nice person and
in touch with my inner child...

38:37.702 --> 38:39.258
I'll give you a chance.

38:39.338 --> 38:44.095
Come out, forget the bullshit,
and we'll discuss this.

38:44.175 --> 38:45.622
I'm going to count to three.

38:47.178 --> 38:49.601
One Mississippi...

38:49.681 --> 38:52.996
two Mississippi...

38:59.258 --> 39:02.698
Opportunity knocked,
and you failed to answer.

39:03.696 --> 39:05.689
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

39:08.668 --> 39:12.073
Let's talk! Let's mingle.

39:15.708 --> 39:18.317
Now I'm getting mad.

39:25.184 --> 39:27.052
This one's locked up, too.

39:28.020 --> 39:30.549
It's possible they didn't stop.
They just took right off.

39:33.293 --> 39:34.888
Just doesn't feel right.

39:51.177 --> 39:52.522
I'm a college graduate.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.478
I used to play college ball.

39:58.519 --> 40:00.501
I ain't got my jacket no more.

40:02.756 --> 40:04.100
That's too bad.

40:06.494 --> 40:08.148
Somebody stole it.

40:08.228 --> 40:12.118
You know, I had great hands, man.

40:12.198 --> 40:13.760
You should have seen me.

40:15.069 --> 40:16.607
Go out wide, Buck.

40:19.774 --> 40:22.610
- What are you doing?
- I'd go out wide.

40:23.277 --> 40:25.270
I could have been Walter Payton.

40:26.581 --> 40:28.893
He played too many games without a helmet.

40:29.784 --> 40:32.206
You think I'm funny or something?

40:32.286 --> 40:36.711
Who do you think you are coming down here,
wearing that jacket and calling me a liar?

40:36.791 --> 40:38.625
I'm a goddamned college graduate!

40:44.366 --> 40:46.439
How the hell can I shut him up?

40:53.841 --> 40:56.732
- Come on, let's get out.
- Come on, move it!

40:56.812 --> 40:58.555
Take-out time, boys.

41:27.577 --> 41:31.313
Shit. Hobo from Purdue. I hate Purdue.

41:33.849 --> 41:36.128
When's the last time they ever won anything?

41:37.988 --> 41:39.492
Plastic.

41:43.360 --> 41:44.806
That's one of them.

41:46.129 --> 41:48.318
Bums must have rolled them.

41:48.398 --> 41:50.174
Welcome to the neighborhood, boys.

42:06.116 --> 42:07.347
There they are!

42:35.913 --> 42:37.086
We can outrun them.

42:39.917 --> 42:41.090
This way!

43:19.024 --> 43:20.197
Hold it.

43:26.298 --> 43:27.643
Get up! Let's go!

43:42.148 --> 43:44.671
- I can't fucking keep up.
- You have to.

43:44.751 --> 43:47.641
Don't leave my ass down here. This is hell.

43:47.721 --> 43:48.975
You can do this.

43:49.055 --> 43:51.411
Take care of me,
I'll give you anything you want.

43:51.491 --> 43:54.681
All I want is for you to move your ass.

43:54.761 --> 43:57.370
We're gonna make it, man... all of us.

43:59.333 --> 44:00.654
I think we lost them.

44:00.734 --> 44:03.012
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

44:03.670 --> 44:05.992
Where are the cops? Someone heard the blast.

44:06.072 --> 44:08.428
You dynamite a city block,
they wouldn't come.

44:08.508 --> 44:11.002
- That's criminal.
- Look at this.

44:16.015 --> 44:18.122
Reach out and touch someone, my ass.

44:18.718 --> 44:19.892
Great.

44:20.688 --> 44:23.091
There's lights on in that building.

44:23.858 --> 44:25.202
Let's go get some help.

44:47.081 --> 44:48.636
Damn! I tore my jacket.

44:48.716 --> 44:50.971
I'd be worried about my ass, not my jacket.

44:51.051 --> 44:54.183
My ass doesn't cost 450 bucks.

45:02.931 --> 45:06.599
If anything happens, don't think, just run.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.995
Let's find someone
who'll let us use their phone.

45:14.075 --> 45:16.465
You think these freaks
will let us use their phone?

45:16.545 --> 45:18.367
These freaks are our neighbors.

45:18.447 --> 45:19.745
Not my neighbors.

45:20.516 --> 45:24.221
I bet we haven't been more
than 10 miles from your door.

45:27.222 --> 45:28.677
What that noise?

45:33.128 --> 45:34.301
We should talk to him.

45:37.499 --> 45:39.036
I got a better idea.

45:57.454 --> 45:59.287
There's a way in.

46:16.973 --> 46:20.789
Hi, sir. I need to use your phone.

46:22.680 --> 46:24.058
Thanks a lot.

46:24.815 --> 46:25.988
Take it easy.

46:26.684 --> 46:28.153
You, too, buddy.

46:28.652 --> 46:30.361
Hello. Anybody home?

46:31.422 --> 46:32.610
What's wrong with these people?

46:32.690 --> 46:34.077
They're just like you.

46:34.157 --> 46:35.579
- How is that?
- They're scared.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.334
They won't even talk to us.

46:38.396 --> 46:40.344
How are you? Can we use your phone?

46:44.735 --> 46:46.147
Nobody's gonna help us.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.929
Welcome to the real world. This is it.

46:52.009 --> 46:55.107
If you say that to me again,
I'm gonna kill you.

47:03.688 --> 47:05.209
Hello? Hello?

47:05.289 --> 47:06.463
Anybody in there?

47:07.426 --> 47:09.293
Please open the door if you're there.

47:20.705 --> 47:23.267
Wait. We don't want to scare her off.

47:27.879 --> 47:29.052
Excuse me.

47:30.982 --> 47:32.471
What do you want?

47:32.551 --> 47:33.672
I need to use a phone.

47:33.752 --> 47:36.918
Just hold it right there. Now, keep back.

47:39.223 --> 47:40.312
Please, just listen.

47:40.392 --> 47:42.981
I'll bust your goddamn heads.
Don't think I won't.

47:43.061 --> 47:45.150
- Are you all right?
- Get out of here.

47:45.230 --> 47:46.319
Just give us a chance...

47:46.399 --> 47:50.656
The only chance you're getting is to get
your asses in gear before I start swinging.

47:50.736 --> 47:54.159
Let's go. These people don't want to help us.

47:54.239 --> 47:56.161
We saw a boy get murdered tonight.

47:56.241 --> 47:58.163
The men that shot him did it in cold blood.

47:58.243 --> 48:00.199
If they catch us, they'll kill us, too.

48:00.279 --> 48:01.734
So they're following you?

48:01.814 --> 48:03.168
No. We lost them.

48:03.248 --> 48:05.561
You got to believe us.
We're telling the truth.

48:06.719 --> 48:09.642
We just want to use your phone
to call the police.

48:09.722 --> 48:10.910
That's it.

48:10.990 --> 48:12.619
We won't cause you any trouble.

48:19.932 --> 48:21.821
This is bullshit.

48:21.901 --> 48:24.635
We lost them. We're just wasting our time.

48:25.170 --> 48:28.061
You know something?
You're beginning to piss me off.

48:28.141 --> 48:29.396
Where he goes, we go.

48:29.476 --> 48:30.581
Shut the fuck up!

48:36.450 --> 48:38.839
These the punks you saw?

48:38.919 --> 48:40.374
They ain't the ones.

48:40.454 --> 48:42.175
What's up? You punks crazy or something?

48:42.255 --> 48:44.744
Chill out. We're looking for some citizens.

48:44.824 --> 48:47.147
He looking for some citizens.

48:47.227 --> 48:49.616
You ain't gonna find
nobody down here like that.

48:49.696 --> 48:50.851
This is our block.

48:50.931 --> 48:54.755
If you got any brains in your head,
you'll break now and don't look back.

48:54.835 --> 48:55.989
We just got some business.

48:56.069 --> 48:57.557
You got some business?

48:57.637 --> 48:59.393
What kind of business?

48:59.473 --> 49:00.727
Wait a minute.

49:00.807 --> 49:02.863
I've had about enough of this bullshit.

49:02.943 --> 49:04.565
I'm gonna ventilate your little cranium.

49:04.645 --> 49:07.134
What do you think about that? Now back off!

49:07.214 --> 49:08.593
Better get your boy.

49:10.151 --> 49:12.039
I got something, too, man.

49:12.119 --> 49:13.714
Little bit too much meat today.

49:14.889 --> 49:17.987
You don't like what I have to say, fuck me.

49:22.229 --> 49:24.552
- What you smiling at?
- I understand. I respect you.

49:24.632 --> 49:26.421
You're taking care of your block.

49:26.501 --> 49:28.756
These guys ripped me off. That can't happen.

49:28.836 --> 49:30.958
- You know what I mean?
- I don't know.

49:31.038 --> 49:33.661
I fuck with you, you're shit
in front of your boys.

49:33.741 --> 49:36.764
So you tell me, how much is this gonna cost?

49:36.844 --> 49:38.700
If I want your money, I'll take it.

49:38.780 --> 49:44.498
You can't take my money,
but you can take my money.

49:46.488 --> 49:48.444
- Go ahead.
- That money got blood on it.

49:48.524 --> 49:49.936
You ever seen any that didn't?

49:54.262 --> 49:57.907
Now go ask Webster over there
where those people went.

50:07.208 --> 50:08.587
I don't believe this.

50:09.545 --> 50:12.134
You're wearing a hole in the carpet, bro.

50:12.214 --> 50:17.039
Cops should be here by now.
It's been 17 minutes.

50:17.119 --> 50:19.341
Down here people die of old age
waiting for the cops.

50:19.421 --> 50:20.842
No goddamn way.

50:20.922 --> 50:23.906
This is bullshit. Watch this.

50:24.393 --> 50:27.559
I'll get their asses over here
in one goddamn second.

50:28.196 --> 50:30.086
- What's wrong?
- The phone's dead.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.727
What do you mean, it's dead?

50:36.906 --> 50:38.862
It must be them. They're here.

50:38.942 --> 50:40.497
Maybe you didn't pay your phone bill.

50:40.577 --> 50:42.741
- Right.
- Shut up, Ray.

50:45.014 --> 50:50.014
Francis Howard Wyatt.

50:51.421 --> 50:53.403
Used to have a girlfriend named Francis.

50:54.324 --> 50:56.346
She had blue eyes just like you.

50:56.426 --> 50:57.929
How does he know my name?

50:58.260 --> 51:00.425
Frank, beautiful baby.

51:01.765 --> 51:04.077
Lucky for you she looks just like your wife.

51:04.768 --> 51:06.856
What's your wife... Italian?

51:06.936 --> 51:09.859
I always wanted to fuck
an Italian girl, Frank.

51:09.939 --> 51:13.063
I'll tell you what, Frankie, Francis...

51:13.143 --> 51:17.401
since you won't meet me man-to-man,
I'm gonna take my case to the people.

51:17.481 --> 51:21.272
People of the housing project,
I got a headline for you.

51:21.352 --> 51:23.880
- This just in...
- Get the fuck out of my house.

51:26.123 --> 51:27.296
Mommy!

51:32.363 --> 51:34.051
Get the hell out of my house!

51:34.131 --> 51:35.886
...really starting to piss me off.

51:35.966 --> 51:37.322
This is the situation.

51:37.402 --> 51:41.926
Give them up, and this will not
be the worst night of your life.

51:42.006 --> 51:43.394
There's nothing on the fifth floor.

51:43.474 --> 51:45.796
- Two more to go.
- We got to take a break.

51:45.876 --> 51:48.633
I told you you should quit smoking.

51:48.713 --> 51:50.011
It's okay.

51:50.848 --> 51:52.649
Everything's going to be all right.

51:54.018 --> 51:55.741
- We can't stay here.
- Are you kidding?

51:55.821 --> 51:57.655
If we go outside, they'll kill us.

51:58.657 --> 52:01.280
These people put their lives
on the line for us.

52:01.360 --> 52:03.638
- Frank's right.
- Yeah, go!

52:05.397 --> 52:06.570
Let's do this.

52:07.499 --> 52:08.877
I'm not going out there.

52:13.304 --> 52:14.793
I'm not going anywhere.

52:14.873 --> 52:16.295
You son of a bitch.

52:16.375 --> 52:18.482
You had that thing the whole time?

52:18.577 --> 52:20.432
Why the hell didn't you use it earlier?

52:20.512 --> 52:22.601
Because I'm using it now.

52:22.681 --> 52:24.469
On us?

52:24.549 --> 52:26.338
Whoever thinks you'll get me
through that door.

52:26.418 --> 52:29.240
Goddamn it! What are you doing?
You're scaring the kid.

52:29.320 --> 52:30.709
The cops will be here any second.

52:30.789 --> 52:32.279
Let's wait here until they arrive.

52:32.359 --> 52:33.980
The cops are not coming.

52:34.060 --> 52:36.441
Yes, they are.

52:37.464 --> 52:40.869
Stay back. I am not going to die down here.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.957
These people weren't involved,
and they helped us.

52:45.037 --> 52:47.460
If those bastards find us here,
they'll kill everybody.

52:47.540 --> 52:49.442
Is that what you want?

52:51.711 --> 52:54.718
You got to trust me.
You don't want this deal.

52:56.382 --> 52:59.183
Come on, Rayzor. Give me the gun!

53:10.229 --> 53:11.684
Let's get out of here.

53:11.764 --> 53:12.985
Go to the roof.

53:13.065 --> 53:15.989
The kids have a way of getting
across to the next building.

53:16.069 --> 53:17.725
It's the only chance you have.

53:17.805 --> 53:18.876
Thanks a lot.

53:29.249 --> 53:32.506
We have a baby! Please leave us alone!

53:32.586 --> 53:34.659
Open the fucking door now!

54:17.532 --> 54:18.830
Give me the gun.

54:31.212 --> 54:33.160
Here. Use this.

54:39.488 --> 54:41.834
Knock, knock, faggot. Open the door.

55:02.144 --> 55:03.317
Fuck.

55:06.115 --> 55:07.288
I found it!

55:15.491 --> 55:17.690
Jesus, that's the escape route?

55:21.865 --> 55:23.038
Let's do it.

55:31.841 --> 55:33.219
Let's go, Ray.

55:44.788 --> 55:46.086
Kids do this.

56:01.739 --> 56:02.912
Let's go, Ray.

56:18.389 --> 56:21.065
Hang on, Mike. Hang on, buddy.

56:25.096 --> 56:26.269
I can't.

56:28.198 --> 56:29.759
The pipe. Use the pipe.

56:31.569 --> 56:34.097
You could shimmy down the drainpipe.

56:46.452 --> 56:48.980
We used to do this
when we were kids, remember?

56:49.655 --> 56:51.067
Just slide down.

56:52.425 --> 56:54.737
Whatever you do, don't look down.

56:55.461 --> 56:57.625
Thanks. I wasn't going to.

56:59.064 --> 57:00.986
I've got a great view from down here.

57:01.066 --> 57:03.422
That's funny. I'm glad you save
your best material...

57:03.502 --> 57:04.800
for the rooftop show.

57:05.638 --> 57:06.811
I'll be here all week.

57:09.342 --> 57:10.429
That's good.

57:10.509 --> 57:13.584
When I get down, I'm gonna
kick your fucking ass.

57:19.485 --> 57:22.141
John, get your ass across that ladder now.

57:22.221 --> 57:23.418
What are you guys doing?

57:25.525 --> 57:26.613
There's a way down over here.

57:26.693 --> 57:28.037
Let's go. Come on.

57:28.828 --> 57:30.216
All right. Come on, buddy.

57:30.296 --> 57:32.018
Don't look down, buddy. Look at me.

57:32.098 --> 57:35.255
That's it. Like the 40-yard line.

57:35.335 --> 57:37.591
There you go. The 30-yard line, man.

57:37.671 --> 57:41.133
The 20. You're at the 10.

57:44.110 --> 57:45.944
That's it. All right.

57:46.980 --> 57:48.368
- Next.
- Go ahead.

57:48.448 --> 57:50.247
I want to follow. You go first.

57:51.718 --> 57:53.407
- You're full of crap.
- Come on.

57:53.487 --> 57:55.375
Climbing across this won't kill you.

57:55.455 --> 57:57.644
- Those guys are!
- I swear to God.

57:57.724 --> 58:01.148
I know when you're full of crap,
and you're full of crap right now!

58:01.228 --> 58:03.183
Don't make me leave you up here!

58:03.263 --> 58:04.652
I said I would do it!

58:04.732 --> 58:05.962
Move it!

58:09.370 --> 58:10.634
You want it in writing?

58:14.074 --> 58:15.419
I will follow you.

58:17.812 --> 58:21.001
All right. Let's do it. Come on.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.188
Watch how simple this is.

58:42.804 --> 58:44.786
Shh. Shh. Shh.

58:50.546 --> 58:51.767
There they are!

58:51.847 --> 58:53.476
Come on, Frank! Move it!

58:55.283 --> 58:57.060
Motherfucker!

58:58.454 --> 58:59.627
Damn!

59:04.092 --> 59:06.803
- Don't believe they got guns.
- It's so easy these days.

59:16.070 --> 59:18.126
Frank!

59:18.206 --> 59:20.245
Go ahead, check it out.

59:25.482 --> 59:26.587
Nice move.

59:27.850 --> 59:29.228
Come to me, goddamn it!

59:38.661 --> 59:39.959
Give me your hand.

59:44.100 --> 59:45.729
I got you!

59:57.079 --> 59:59.335
- What are you doing?
- I ain't no acrobat.

59:59.415 --> 01:00:01.137
I'll negotiate with these guys.

01:00:01.217 --> 01:00:02.482
What with?

01:00:04.455 --> 01:00:06.403
I got them where I want them.

01:00:08.426 --> 01:00:11.638
- I'm the Rayzor Man, remember?
- Let's go!

01:00:31.314 --> 01:00:33.003
Easy, fellas. Hear me out a second.

01:00:33.083 --> 01:00:35.639
Just give me a chance to talk, okay?

01:00:35.719 --> 01:00:37.107
Talk about what?

01:00:37.187 --> 01:00:39.830
Something near and dear to my heart... money.

01:00:41.392 --> 01:00:43.180
- Money's good.
- No doubt.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:44.821
Money makes the world go round.

01:00:47.532 --> 01:00:49.035
You fire, they'll kill him.

01:00:50.802 --> 01:00:52.146
And if I don't?

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:58.830
- Start talking.
- There's no reason for this.

01:00:58.910 --> 01:01:01.400
Whatever happened to that kid,
I'm sure he deserved it.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.678
That's your business.

01:01:04.616 --> 01:01:06.638
Nobody's going to the police.

01:01:06.718 --> 01:01:08.573
All we want to do is get home.

01:01:08.653 --> 01:01:10.108
Home.

01:01:10.188 --> 01:01:12.022
Home is where the heart is, right?

01:01:13.491 --> 01:01:16.014
Excuse me for a minute.
Correct me if I'm wrong,

01:01:16.094 --> 01:01:18.550
but didn't you say something about money?

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.552
Yeah, I did.

01:01:20.632 --> 01:01:23.616
How about $100,000 cash?

01:01:24.569 --> 01:01:26.191
Then we go our separate ways.

01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.060
You can raise that kind of money?

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.337
Yes, I can.

01:01:31.076 --> 01:01:34.151
Let me ask you something.
What are those shoes? Italian?

01:01:38.017 --> 01:01:40.249
Yeah. They're actually Italian running shoes.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:43.424
Actually, kind of working well
for me this evening.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:46.979
And your dad's what? He's a stockbroker?

01:01:47.059 --> 01:01:50.182
Something like that. But I'm a self-made guy.

01:01:50.262 --> 01:01:52.885
I'm a self-starter. Just like you.

01:01:52.965 --> 01:01:54.320
That's funny.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:55.888
These guys say that to me.

01:01:55.968 --> 01:01:58.056
- That's why we hang with him.
- Self-made man.

01:01:58.136 --> 01:02:00.393
Tomorrow morning, you'll have the cash.

01:02:00.473 --> 01:02:03.274
In the meantime, how about a little deposit?

01:02:06.145 --> 01:02:07.491
May I see that?

01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:12.673
This is a beautiful ring.

01:02:12.753 --> 01:02:14.641
Take a look at this, man.

01:02:14.721 --> 01:02:17.344
- Check this out.
- That's beautiful, man.

01:02:17.424 --> 01:02:18.679
Take this home to your girl.

01:02:18.759 --> 01:02:21.648
How much is a ring like that worth?

01:02:21.728 --> 01:02:23.617
Retail, that's 15K.

01:02:23.697 --> 01:02:27.253
But for you guys, call it down payment.

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.894
Under the table.

01:02:30.003 --> 01:02:32.259
You know, I think we can cut a deal here.

01:02:32.339 --> 01:02:34.994
Oh, man. Yeah, that's beautiful.

01:02:35.074 --> 01:02:37.022
I can't believe this. He's doing it.

01:02:38.812 --> 01:02:40.281
You're pretty good. What's your name? Ray?

01:02:41.882 --> 01:02:44.671
You're a good negotiator because
you didn't even lowball me.

01:02:44.751 --> 01:02:47.841
I'm gonna come and lowball you?
Forget about that.

01:02:47.921 --> 01:02:49.344
Well, I got to trust you.

01:02:49.424 --> 01:02:50.845
There's the payment of the money,

01:02:50.925 --> 01:02:53.715
and then there's your friends
keeping their mouths shut.

01:02:53.795 --> 01:02:56.351
Hold on. We're businessmen, both of us.

01:02:56.431 --> 01:02:57.934
We have an understanding.

01:03:00.968 --> 01:03:03.132
Let me tell you something, Ray.

01:03:04.872 --> 01:03:09.030
You don't understand shit, okay? Nothing.

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:12.233
You got to check your pants
for your dick. I got one.

01:03:12.313 --> 01:03:16.858
You and your friends are the spoon-fed,
fucking fruit bait that I fucking hate!

01:03:18.386 --> 01:03:20.975
- I don't think you understood.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:03:21.055 --> 01:03:23.478
You speak when fucking spoken to, okay?

01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:25.547
This is not fucking high school,
motherfucker.

01:03:25.627 --> 01:03:27.715
I'll eat your fucking friends
for fucking lunch!

01:03:27.795 --> 01:03:30.986
You know who we are?
You have no fucking idea, do you? No.

01:03:31.066 --> 01:03:32.821
Jerks like you sail through life...

01:03:32.901 --> 01:03:35.023
reading about people like me
in the newspaper.

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:37.860
You're in a different place
now, motherfucker.

01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:39.828
$100,000 might buy you out of North Shore.

01:03:39.908 --> 01:03:43.040
Down here, that means shit!
This is my fucking world!

01:03:43.912 --> 01:03:45.359
Two hundred thousand.

01:04:03.666 --> 01:04:05.796
- We got a deal?
- Yeah.

01:04:09.104 --> 01:04:10.660
You schooled me!

01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:14.806
You took my heart
and surgically implanted it.

01:04:16.846 --> 01:04:18.885
Soon, my pulse will be back to normal.

01:04:21.785 --> 01:04:25.008
God. Music to my ears. It's beautiful.

01:04:25.088 --> 01:04:27.252
I'm getting off this roof in one piece.

01:04:38.501 --> 01:04:41.223
Jesus! It's all right.

01:04:41.303 --> 01:04:43.360
Let me go, Frank! Wait!

01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:45.182
Okay, come on, John! Go!

01:05:16.073 --> 01:05:17.486
Don't look at him, John.

01:05:18.175 --> 01:05:19.850
Come on, he's gone, man!

01:06:18.371 --> 01:06:19.867
Frank.

01:06:50.837 --> 01:06:52.432
We should've done something.

01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:58.479
Makes no sense for Ray to go out like that.

01:07:01.147 --> 01:07:03.277
Nothing about tonight makes much sense.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.820
I keep hearing him screaming.

01:07:11.158 --> 01:07:12.992
Hello, ladies.

01:07:14.595 --> 01:07:16.717
It's our little chickenshits.

01:07:16.797 --> 01:07:17.970
Go!

01:07:33.447 --> 01:07:35.075
This way!

01:07:42.023 --> 01:07:43.857
Frank, get down!

01:07:59.273 --> 01:08:00.495
This way!

01:08:00.575 --> 01:08:01.839
Right here!

01:08:36.211 --> 01:08:37.385
Mike.

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:42.890
John.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:45.322
We got to keep moving.

01:08:58.769 --> 01:09:00.390
Split up.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.326
This is stupid.

01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:03.966
You think we'll catch these guys?

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.654
You coming?

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:18.600
- Watch your ass.
- Shit. I always do, Mom.

01:09:43.814 --> 01:09:48.840
FALLON, SINGING:
Oh, when the saints go marching in

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.675
These guys don't give up.

01:09:50.755 --> 01:09:53.844
Oh, when the saints go marching in

01:09:53.924 --> 01:09:57.248
They're right on our ass.
We got to get out of here.

01:09:57.328 --> 01:10:00.312
Where are they coming from?
We don't want to run into them.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.222
No. It's too bright up there!

01:10:05.302 --> 01:10:07.725
Might as well stick a bull's-eye
on your back.

01:10:07.805 --> 01:10:09.035
What are we gonna do?

01:10:14.178 --> 01:10:16.534
We got to make a stand.

01:10:16.614 --> 01:10:18.596
It's our only chance of getting out alive.

01:10:21.487 --> 01:10:24.954
Always wondered how I'd do
in combat, could I cut it?

01:10:25.991 --> 01:10:27.700
You ever wonder about that?

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.425
Guess I'm about to find out.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:36.154
Mike, they got guns. We have nothing.

01:10:36.234 --> 01:10:37.613
Screw the guns.

01:10:39.337 --> 01:10:41.946
If we watch each other's back, we'll be okay.

01:10:51.016 --> 01:10:52.486
There you go, Johnny Boy.

01:10:53.519 --> 01:10:54.863
Let's do it.

01:10:56.088 --> 01:10:57.649
Hey, Frank.

01:10:59.525 --> 01:11:01.508
Let's show these punks what we got.

01:11:04.598 --> 01:11:06.085
Right.

01:11:06.165 --> 01:11:08.888
There's three ways in here.
There's three of us.

01:11:08.968 --> 01:11:10.438
We watch each other's backs.

01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:14.736
Let's go!

01:11:47.575 --> 01:11:49.021
You guys down there?

01:12:03.558 --> 01:12:04.936
I got your back.

01:12:07.395 --> 01:12:09.516
I'm relying on you, bro.

01:12:55.644 --> 01:12:56.732
Frank.

01:12:56.812 --> 01:12:58.487
Frank.

01:13:47.064 --> 01:13:48.319
Where are you guys at?

01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:50.381
Don't you move!

01:13:52.936 --> 01:13:54.838
Who's the chickenshit now?

01:13:55.906 --> 01:13:57.079
Gonna shoot me?

01:14:00.444 --> 01:14:03.468
You ever shoot anybody before?
I don't think so.

01:14:03.548 --> 01:14:05.636
Now, if you don't give me that back,

01:14:05.716 --> 01:14:08.484
the same thing that happened
to Ray will happen to you.

01:14:50.762 --> 01:14:52.960
Did you see the look on his face?

01:14:53.932 --> 01:14:55.607
He didn't think I could do it.

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:01.268
Let's move.

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:06.031
No, screw that!

01:15:06.111 --> 01:15:08.134
I say we stay down here, and we finish them.

01:15:08.214 --> 01:15:10.686
You know, things are a little different now.

01:15:11.784 --> 01:15:16.042
What is the matter with you?
This isn't a goddamn game!

01:15:16.122 --> 01:15:17.295
John, let's go.

01:15:19.792 --> 01:15:21.740
Hey, what happened to you, kid?

01:15:26.666 --> 01:15:28.568
I thought you had my back!

01:15:29.769 --> 01:15:32.081
Hey, John, I'm talking to you!

01:15:58.665 --> 01:16:00.225
We got to find some cover.

01:16:10.844 --> 01:16:12.519
What the hell happened down there?

01:16:15.315 --> 01:16:17.037
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

01:16:17.117 --> 01:16:19.953
Sorry doesn't cut it.
You almost got me killed.

01:16:21.187 --> 01:16:22.709
Back off, Mike.

01:16:22.789 --> 01:16:26.480
Your baby brother fucked up!
He better not do it again!

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:28.724
Oh, yeah? Or what?

01:16:36.438 --> 01:16:38.693
See? That's the Frank I used to know.

01:16:38.773 --> 01:16:40.219
You better believe it.

01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:43.841
Let's get off the street.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.644
Yes, sir, boss.

01:17:04.833 --> 01:17:06.508
This is great.

01:17:07.836 --> 01:17:12.587
I don't know about you guys,
but I didn't sign on for this.

01:17:13.442 --> 01:17:16.098
This is your fault, Fallon.

01:17:16.178 --> 01:17:19.516
Your best buddy's dead because
of you and your goddamn rules.

01:17:21.083 --> 01:17:23.851
Ever hear the one about
taking care of your own?

01:17:27.423 --> 01:17:29.645
You mean you'd let these guys
get away with this?

01:17:29.725 --> 01:17:31.228
No, I wouldn't let these...

01:17:43.038 --> 01:17:46.028
You know what I hate?
I hate whiners, you know?

01:17:46.108 --> 01:17:48.910
I hate people who just complain.

01:17:49.712 --> 01:17:52.702
I had a guy one time in the cell next to me.

01:17:52.782 --> 01:17:56.306
He used to yap about everything.
Used to yap about the food,

01:17:56.386 --> 01:17:59.275
yap about the guards,
yap about this and that.

01:17:59.355 --> 01:18:02.646
Yap, yap, yap all night long.
Fucking yap, yap, yap.

01:18:02.726 --> 01:18:04.714
Like a fucking 747.

01:18:04.794 --> 01:18:08.932
Like an engine stuck between your ears,
and you can't get away from it.

01:18:13.136 --> 01:18:14.674
I don't think he's getting up.

01:18:25.449 --> 01:18:27.043
He's gone now.

01:19:17.202 --> 01:19:18.467
Damn it.

01:19:20.539 --> 01:19:22.976
If those assholes were here right now, I'd...

01:19:25.778 --> 01:19:27.578
probably just freeze.

01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:35.352
I tried.

01:19:36.722 --> 01:19:38.397
I couldn't move, Frank.

01:19:41.126 --> 01:19:42.539
Keep it together.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:45.627
Keep it together?

01:19:47.265 --> 01:19:48.860
Fuck you, Frank!

01:19:50.001 --> 01:19:51.471
I'm scared.

01:19:53.772 --> 01:19:55.151
I'm really scared.

01:19:57.544 --> 01:19:59.890
I don't think I'll make it
through this night.

01:20:05.317 --> 01:20:06.821
I don't know what to do.

01:20:09.255 --> 01:20:10.429
Come here.

01:20:12.258 --> 01:20:16.074
Everybody gets scared,
whether they admit it or not.

01:20:17.797 --> 01:20:19.175
I'm scared, too.

01:20:30.377 --> 01:20:33.987
Look at me. I'm crying like a baby here.

01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:37.813
Thanks...

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:41.313
for sticking up for me.

01:20:42.523 --> 01:20:45.564
Yeah, well, Mike's as scared as we are.

01:20:49.397 --> 01:20:50.991
Nobody out on the street.

01:20:53.901 --> 01:20:55.523
So what do you think, boss?

01:20:55.603 --> 01:20:57.380
Cool it on that boss stuff.

01:21:09.016 --> 01:21:10.964
You guys aren't gonna believe this!

01:21:12.453 --> 01:21:13.592
Let's go!

01:21:20.595 --> 01:21:21.983
Hey, over here!

01:21:22.063 --> 01:21:23.236
Stop!

01:21:24.433 --> 01:21:27.599
Hey, lady! Hold up the bus!

01:21:28.570 --> 01:21:29.641
What are you doing?

01:21:30.839 --> 01:21:33.550
- Stop the bus!
- I don't think so.

01:21:39.415 --> 01:21:40.861
It's coming back.

01:21:41.916 --> 01:21:44.388
Come back here and give us a ride!

01:21:47.989 --> 01:21:51.380
I don't get it! You used to
have bigger balls than anybody!

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:53.915
Is that what you think this is about? Balls?

01:21:53.995 --> 01:21:55.717
What about using your goddamn brain!

01:21:55.797 --> 01:21:57.886
- Watch what you say!
- What are you trying to prove?

01:21:57.966 --> 01:21:59.456
That you can get us killed?

01:21:59.536 --> 01:22:01.657
Because that's exactly
what you're going to do!

01:22:01.737 --> 01:22:05.295
I got a wife and a little girl,
and I will get back to them!

01:22:05.375 --> 01:22:09.765
You want to go out down here like some
goddamn hero, then you do it alone.

01:22:09.845 --> 01:22:11.223
Let's go, John.

01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:16.906
Frank. Frank!

01:22:16.986 --> 01:22:18.284
What, goddamn it?

01:22:22.024 --> 01:22:23.437
Just wait up.

01:23:19.783 --> 01:23:21.413
Maybe there's another way in.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:27.227
It's kind of dark.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.214
I don't see anything.

01:23:30.294 --> 01:23:32.459
There's got to be a security guard.

01:23:33.465 --> 01:23:36.187
Well, let's try and wake him up!

01:23:38.837 --> 01:23:41.331
- Hello!
- We're in trouble now.

01:24:04.397 --> 01:24:06.800
Hey, concierge, I need a room!

01:24:09.969 --> 01:24:12.919
Hell of a security system.
Excellent response time.

01:24:16.842 --> 01:24:18.140
A little help!

01:24:19.912 --> 01:24:21.934
Hello, anybody home?

01:24:22.014 --> 01:24:24.360
Yeah, anybody got a problem with that?

01:24:26.852 --> 01:24:28.321
Come on and get us!

01:24:29.188 --> 01:24:30.453
Okay, freeze!

01:24:31.957 --> 01:24:34.347
- There's two of them!
- I said freeze!

01:24:34.427 --> 01:24:37.516
And put your hands on top
of the counter and spread them.

01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:39.184
Do it!

01:24:39.264 --> 01:24:40.653
Anything you say!

01:24:40.733 --> 01:24:42.623
All right, we're freezing!

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:45.859
We're freezing and spreading.
Anything else you want us to do?

01:24:45.939 --> 01:24:47.627
You frisk them. I'll call Five-0.

01:24:47.707 --> 01:24:50.229
Uh-oh, Frank. They're calling the cops.

01:24:50.309 --> 01:24:51.731
That's 9-1-1, buddy.

01:24:51.811 --> 01:24:54.852
Tell them to haul ass.
These creeps are really loaded.

01:25:18.405 --> 01:25:19.851
Let's get to work.

01:25:22.742 --> 01:25:24.565
- Listen, the reason...
- Save it, punk.

01:25:24.645 --> 01:25:26.233
- These guys are after us.
- Look.

01:25:26.313 --> 01:25:28.069
You tell it to the cops.

01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:30.428
They get paid to listen
to your bullshit stories.

01:25:33.353 --> 01:25:35.666
- Watch it.
- Careful, I'm ticklish.

01:25:40.327 --> 01:25:41.558
Mister, there's one thing I...

01:25:43.464 --> 01:25:46.354
Put your hands back up on the cooler.

01:25:46.434 --> 01:25:48.837
You understand me? Don't make a move!

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:52.026
FALLON, OVER P.A.: Attention, shoppers.

01:25:52.106 --> 01:25:56.597
We have a special in the frozen
foods department tonight...

01:25:56.677 --> 01:25:58.065
dead meat!

01:25:58.145 --> 01:26:01.277
Plump, juicy, and fresh
from our North Shore farm.

01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:05.033
Shop till you drop, right, Frank?

01:26:06.422 --> 01:26:09.406
Get back on the cooler! Get on there!

01:26:10.726 --> 01:26:13.582
You guys tell your friend
to get down here right now!

01:26:13.662 --> 01:26:15.283
Listen, this guy's not our friend!

01:26:15.363 --> 01:26:17.676
I'm tired of fooling around
with you, understand me?

01:26:32.313 --> 01:26:33.658
Motherfucker!

01:26:59.175 --> 01:27:01.852
Mike! Mike! Come on.

01:27:17.894 --> 01:27:19.067
Damn!

01:27:31.776 --> 01:27:34.419
- Go on.
- No way.

01:27:35.646 --> 01:27:39.176
I'm gonna deal with these guys.
I'm gonna handle this.

01:27:40.418 --> 01:27:44.274
Will you cut this heroics crap and let's go?

01:27:44.354 --> 01:27:47.911
Frank, you got a family.

01:27:47.991 --> 01:27:49.255
Me...

01:27:51.529 --> 01:27:52.998
All I got is you.

01:28:01.439 --> 01:28:02.669
Stay there.

01:29:22.855 --> 01:29:24.028
Mike.

01:29:51.585 --> 01:29:52.758
Hey, Frank.

01:29:58.625 --> 01:30:00.618
Why don't you come get your friend?

01:30:04.865 --> 01:30:06.061
Aah!

01:30:22.384 --> 01:30:23.471
Shh.

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:24.815
What's up, man?

01:30:45.474 --> 01:30:48.241
Let's stand together

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:53.789
It's all right with me

01:31:05.461 --> 01:31:07.203
Argh!

01:31:23.211 --> 01:31:24.476
Come on, get up!

01:31:41.898 --> 01:31:43.675
Jesus. Jesus, Mike!

01:31:50.574 --> 01:31:51.661
Get up!

01:31:51.741 --> 01:31:53.062
You guys are unbelievable!

01:31:53.142 --> 01:31:56.132
I was there, and I don't even believe it.

01:31:56.212 --> 01:31:57.841
Let's go! Let's move!

01:32:05.622 --> 01:32:06.910
Come on! This way.

01:32:06.990 --> 01:32:08.665
I'm okay.

01:32:34.685 --> 01:32:35.858
Come on.

01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.347
Mike, you're gonna be okay.

01:32:59.211 --> 01:33:02.200
I'm gonna go get help.
John's gonna stay here with you.

01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.625
Yes, sir, boss.

01:33:06.852 --> 01:33:08.150
Come on.

01:33:12.323 --> 01:33:13.520
Easy, easy.

01:33:19.164 --> 01:33:20.337
Give me your hand.

01:33:22.601 --> 01:33:24.549
Put your hand there and keep it there.

01:33:26.905 --> 01:33:28.078
You all right?

01:33:37.517 --> 01:33:38.895
Don't do anything stupid.

01:33:51.898 --> 01:33:54.632
Come out, Frank! Scumbag!

01:33:57.437 --> 01:34:00.649
Meet me man-to-man. Let's get it over with.

01:34:10.650 --> 01:34:12.062
What are you afraid of?

01:34:14.588 --> 01:34:15.784
Faggot!

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:28.303
Come on, Frank!

01:34:29.002 --> 01:34:31.986
I'm gonna kill you and
your two fucking pussy friends!

01:35:17.185 --> 01:35:18.655
You look fucked-up.

01:35:20.188 --> 01:35:21.692
At least I can walk.

01:36:14.744 --> 01:36:17.956
Hey, you fucking scumbag! I'm out here!

01:36:21.051 --> 01:36:23.455
I said I'm out here, you piece of shit!

01:36:52.082 --> 01:36:56.365
After I kill you, I'm gonna pay
a visit on that wife of yours.

01:39:23.104 --> 01:39:25.097
What were you gonna do to my wife?

01:39:26.273 --> 01:39:29.109
What's the matter, asshole?
Why so quiet all of a sudden?

01:39:46.495 --> 01:39:48.123
You fucking scum!

01:40:15.757 --> 01:40:18.103
Jesus Christ. You're Frank?

01:40:20.328 --> 01:40:22.367
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

01:40:26.868 --> 01:40:29.192
You think you hurt me tonight, is that it?

01:40:29.272 --> 01:40:33.095
Is that what you think, Francis? Answer me!

01:40:33.175 --> 01:40:35.157
You fucking prick. Get up!

01:40:37.146 --> 01:40:38.525
This how you're gonna go out?

01:40:42.519 --> 01:40:43.817
You're not getting away...

01:40:45.321 --> 01:40:47.155
because I know where you're going.

01:40:48.425 --> 01:40:50.771
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me?

01:40:52.696 --> 01:40:54.751
I don't think so, pal.

01:40:54.831 --> 01:40:58.555
Nineteen twenty-two Deadwood Drive.

01:40:58.635 --> 01:41:01.197
That's a fucking riot. Deadwood Drive.

01:41:02.539 --> 01:41:04.669
Bet you got a nice house up there.

01:41:06.208 --> 01:41:07.746
Can't wait to meet your daughter.

01:41:09.012 --> 01:41:11.067
What's her name again?

01:41:11.147 --> 01:41:13.528
Doesn't matter. You'll never
see her grow up, anyways.

01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:31.399
Help me, for Christ's sake!

01:41:34.539 --> 01:41:36.338
I knew you'd do the right thing.

01:41:41.311 --> 01:41:44.227
Give up, Francis. Coming with me?

01:41:45.616 --> 01:41:46.846
Come on, Francis.

01:41:48.118 --> 01:41:49.589
You're on your own, pal.

01:42:21.385 --> 01:42:23.060
And don't call me Francis.

01:43:24.951 --> 01:43:26.124
Frank!

01:43:28.321 --> 01:43:29.859
Frank, you all right?

01:43:32.927 --> 01:43:34.339
Where are you?

01:43:37.565 --> 01:43:40.606
Stay where you are! Everything's all right.

01:43:42.603 --> 01:43:43.901
It's over.

01:44:10.899 --> 01:44:12.120
Nine-one-one.

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.036
Hello. This is an emergency. I need help.

01:44:18.239 --> 01:44:20.768
Sir, are you still there?

01:44:23.978 --> 01:44:27.336
Look, my brother and my friend
are bleeding to death upstairs.

01:44:27.416 --> 01:44:30.038
- Get down on the floor.
- You're not listening to me!

01:44:30.118 --> 01:44:31.291
Down!

01:44:32.487 --> 01:44:35.110
- I don't fucking believe this!
- Al, he's telling the truth.

01:44:35.190 --> 01:44:36.819
It's like a battleground out here.

01:44:55.077 --> 01:44:57.165
Excuse me. How is he?

01:44:57.245 --> 01:45:00.047
He's lost a lot of blood.
His vital signs are good.

01:45:02.619 --> 01:45:04.247
Take it easy, man.

01:45:05.287 --> 01:45:07.743
Hey, buddy, they say you're gonna be okay.

01:45:07.823 --> 01:45:09.878
I better be.

01:45:09.958 --> 01:45:12.430
I got tickets to the Bears game next week.

01:45:13.162 --> 01:45:14.851
Well, you have a good time.

01:45:14.931 --> 01:45:18.154
Wait. I got seats on the 50-yard line.

01:45:18.234 --> 01:45:22.526
Listen, I'm gonna be home
with Linda and the baby,

01:45:22.606 --> 01:45:24.166
watching the game on TV.

01:45:25.542 --> 01:45:27.945
You... you're a wimp.

01:45:29.979 --> 01:45:31.483
Hey, John.

01:45:33.049 --> 01:45:34.883
Mike got tickets to the Bears game.

01:45:36.286 --> 01:45:37.756
No, thanks, Frank.

01:45:39.656 --> 01:45:41.330
I'm too young for this shit.

01:45:45.795 --> 01:45:47.298
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:45:48.565 --> 01:45:51.366
Mr. Wyatt, we found this inside.

01:45:52.536 --> 01:45:54.005
You must have dropped it.

01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:57.401
It's a good-looking family.

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.802
Mr. Wyatt, your wife's outside.

01:46:04.882 --> 01:46:07.012
Hey, Petowski, on the double.

01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.519
All right, here we go.
