02:00.920 --> 02:03.115
- Hello.
- Hot, isn't it.

02:07.227 --> 02:08.158
I'm home.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.290
Thanks.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.927
You don't need a bag for just milk!

02:17.103 --> 02:18.570
They put it in one.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.764
Just say 'no'! ...pour me some, too.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.837
Dad, want some barley tea?

02:24.277 --> 02:27.144
Please... I'll come there.

02:28.281 --> 02:31.842
- The word processor open?
- I'm still printing.

02:32.785 --> 02:35.447
I should buy an electronic notebook.

02:38.525 --> 02:41.016
You could've gone to your aunt's, too.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.958
No. Shiho wears me out.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.898
Oh, I've got work tomorrow.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.399
Do you need lunch?

02:48.501 --> 02:50.196
No, I'll eat out.

02:50.303 --> 02:54.296
The library's busy going to
a bar-code system.

02:54.407 --> 02:57.433
I like the book-cards better.

02:58.478 --> 02:59.968
Me, too.

03:00.079 --> 03:02.479
Hey, this isn't right...

03:02.582 --> 03:03.913
What?

03:04.984 --> 03:07.475
Did you leave out a line?

03:08.621 --> 03:10.111
You're right!

03:10.223 --> 03:13.681
Let me go first. I have to
get this right or my prof will complain.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.252
Amasawa Seiji

03:17.964 --> 03:19.295
This guy...

03:20.600 --> 03:22.864
You can read, but don't stay up too late.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.163
Yeah... good night.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.314
I thought I'd seen that name before...

03:39.219 --> 03:40.243
Here, too...

03:42.288 --> 03:47.487
Amasawa Seiji

03:48.061 --> 03:51.519
He's taken all these books out
before me.

03:59.272 --> 04:04.471
Amasawa Seiji... what's he like?
Is he good-Iooking?

04:12.218 --> 04:15.153
Amasawa Seiji

04:22.729 --> 04:25.755
Shizuku! Get up!

04:25.865 --> 04:27.526
I'm leaving!

04:29.602 --> 04:33.163
Did you sleep in your clothes?
Put the rice on.

04:33.673 --> 04:35.834
'Bye!

04:39.045 --> 04:41.946
Oh, no! I've got to meet Yuko!

04:44.550 --> 04:45.949
My purse...

04:47.186 --> 04:49.381
You ran back upstairs again?

04:49.489 --> 04:50.478
Yeah.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.191
That's funny...

04:53.860 --> 04:55.259
Try by the phone...

04:56.195 --> 04:57.127
Yes!

04:57.230 --> 04:58.720
...where you left it.

04:58.831 --> 05:01.356
I'm late! Lock the door!

05:01.634 --> 05:03.101
Silly!

05:11.611 --> 05:14.102
It's flying so low!

05:18.918 --> 05:20.545
Today's a lucky day!

05:45.378 --> 05:47.744
Is it ever hot!

05:55.855 --> 05:58.380
How's it going?

06:18.878 --> 06:20.573
Hit it!

06:20.980 --> 06:23.346
Hi, Shizuku!

06:23.850 --> 06:27.013
Hi!

06:30.623 --> 06:32.250
Miss Kosaka?

06:33.092 --> 06:35.526
Tsukishima? What are you doing here?

06:35.628 --> 06:37.755
Could I ask a favor?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.463
Nothing weird, I hope...

06:40.566 --> 06:42.124
Let me in the library!

06:42.235 --> 06:43.259
What?

06:43.636 --> 06:45.866
Can't you wait till school starts?

06:45.972 --> 06:49.601
I've read all my books,
and the public library's closed.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.777
I m reading 20 before school starts.

06:53.880 --> 06:58.044
You ve got high-school entrance exams,
don't forget.

06:58.551 --> 06:59.745
Hurry it up!

06:59.852 --> 07:01.649
Here it is!

07:01.821 --> 07:03.049
Bring it here.

07:05.158 --> 07:08.184
Give me your card and the book card.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.261
Yes, ma'am.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.930
No one's ever borrowed this book!

07:15.701 --> 07:19.228
It's rare. They don't even have it
at the public library.

07:24.477 --> 07:27.275
Donated

07:27.847 --> 07:30.315
'Amasawa'... Miss!

07:30.750 --> 07:33.344
Do you know who this 'Amasawa'is?

07:33.553 --> 07:36.579
Look what you made me do!

07:36.756 --> 07:40.021
Someone gave it to us.
I wouldn't know him.

07:40.126 --> 07:41.889
Ask an older teacher.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.325
Shizuku!

07:43.696 --> 07:48.759
What are you doing here?
I've been at the front gate since 11!

07:49.001 --> 07:52.562
If I have to stand in the sun
I get more freckles!

07:52.672 --> 07:53.536
Sorry!

07:53.639 --> 07:57.268
Relax, Harada. You take freckles
much too seriously.

07:57.376 --> 07:59.970
They're a serious problem, Miss!

08:00.313 --> 08:04.249
Yeah, yeah... OK, out of here,
both of you.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.114
Move up! Move up!

08:13.292 --> 08:17.991
I tried, but it's not going to work.
Why not just sing it in English?

08:20.032 --> 08:23.297
'White clouds spreading up
over a hill...

08:23.402 --> 08:27.771
'... a road winds up to the town.'

08:28.307 --> 08:32.174
'An old house with small windows...

08:32.278 --> 08:36.408
'An old dog waits
for me to come home...

08:36.515 --> 08:40.976
'Country road leading far away...

08:41.087 --> 08:45.581
'The road to my old home town...

08:45.691 --> 08:50.025
'West 'Ginia, my mother
the mountain...

08:50.129 --> 08:54.532
'My good old home town.'

08:54.767 --> 08:56.667
- That's not bad.
- Yes, it is.

08:57.803 --> 08:58.895
It's trite.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.133
Yeah?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.867
I wrote another one.

09:05.011 --> 09:09.607
'Concrete roads, everywhere...

09:09.849 --> 09:14.650
'Cut down all the trees,
filled in the valleys...

09:14.820 --> 09:17.220
'Western Tokyo...

09:17.323 --> 09:19.416
'Tama Mountain...

09:19.525 --> 09:23.894
'My home town is concrete roads.'

09:25.231 --> 09:27.028
What is this?!

09:28.067 --> 09:29.694
But what's this 'problem'?

09:30.870 --> 09:32.667
You don't need the lyrics yet...

09:32.772 --> 09:35.900
No... are you in love with anyone?

09:36.475 --> 09:37.407
What?

09:37.810 --> 09:41.576
Studying for entrance exams
would be easier having someone.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.410
We could encourage each other.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.718
Yuko! You're in love!

09:48.988 --> 09:50.819
You got a love letter?!

09:51.090 --> 09:51.886
Shh!

09:51.991 --> 09:54.084
When? Who? Is he handsome?

09:54.193 --> 09:57.492
He's in another class. He's not bad.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.794
Meet him, then! If you don't like him,
just say no!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.161
Yeah, but...

10:03.703 --> 10:06.171
So there's someone else you like!

10:08.307 --> 10:12.004
You can't hide it from me! Confess!

10:13.512 --> 10:15.446
It's Su... Su...

10:15.548 --> 10:17.277
Tsukishima!

10:18.117 --> 10:19.607
Bring me my bag, will you?

10:20.486 --> 10:21.316
Sugimura!

10:21.420 --> 10:24.116
That blue sports bag.

10:24.590 --> 10:26.114
Come on, Tsukishima!

10:27.226 --> 10:28.853
Throw it over here.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.795
Shut up and go back to the bench!

10:32.898 --> 10:36.561
I'm first-string, and we're
through to the regionals!

10:36.669 --> 10:37.761
Yuko?

10:49.715 --> 10:52.980
You're in love with Sugimura?

10:53.219 --> 10:57.121
What am I going to do?
The way I reacted, he might know!

10:57.323 --> 10:59.621
Don't worry. He's too dense.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.456
What about the guy who wrote you?

11:06.866 --> 11:09.596
I'll think about it a while.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.196
I see.

11:11.637 --> 11:15.266
At least your parents aren't
always a fter you to study.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.865
Silence isn't always great.

11:18.210 --> 11:19.802
I wonder...

11:20.880 --> 11:22.472
- Oh, no!
- What?

11:22.581 --> 11:24.811
I forgot my book! I'll go back.

11:24.917 --> 11:25.849
I'll ride you.

11:25.951 --> 11:28.818
No. You'll be late for cram school.

11:28.954 --> 11:30.683
I'll call you.

12:09.962 --> 12:11.691
That book...

12:12.298 --> 12:14.698
Oh, is it yours?

12:19.939 --> 12:21.600
Here, 'Tsukishima Shizuku'.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.605
How do you know my name?

12:25.044 --> 12:26.602
Guess!

12:27.913 --> 12:30.108
My library card...

12:30.449 --> 12:34.249
I'd forget about
'Concrete Road', though.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.121
You read it!

12:42.995 --> 12:44.895
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

12:46.699 --> 12:48.496
Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!

12:53.172 --> 12:54.298
Jerk!

13:04.750 --> 13:07.241
'I'd forget about "Concrete Road"...'

13:08.254 --> 13:09.380
Get lost!

13:48.460 --> 13:49.654
I'm home.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.931
Shiho? You're back already?

13:54.033 --> 13:56.228
I'm beat!

13:56.936 --> 14:00.428
I got a ride with someone
who was coming this way.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.133
Where's Mom?

14:03.275 --> 14:06.210
Summer Intensive Seminar.
Oad's at work.

14:07.213 --> 14:09.443
You could clean up a little...

14:09.782 --> 14:11.306
What about dinner?

14:11.483 --> 14:12.882
I'm going to wash the rice.

14:12.985 --> 14:16.011
Shizuku! The breakfast things
are still out!

14:16.589 --> 14:18.614
I'm getting to it!

14:21.260 --> 14:24.161
Mom's busy! We've got to help!

14:29.935 --> 14:33.962
Do the rice and put away the washing.
I'll take a shower and make dinner.

14:36.141 --> 14:39.269
Aunt says come see her
when you get into high school.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.180
Are you studying?

14:42.982 --> 14:46.941
Don't think you can take it easy
just because Mom and Dad don't bug you.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.217
I know!

14:50.956 --> 14:53.447
She even wanted me
to bring home soy sauce!

14:53.559 --> 14:55.584
That's your aunt, all right.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.958
It was the same thing last year.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.591
Yes! It was miso! Boy, was it heavy!

15:02.701 --> 15:04.828
Two kilos of it!

15:19.084 --> 15:23.316
Shizuku! Get up and vacuum
by your desk!

15:23.856 --> 15:25.585
I'm washing the sheets.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.687
And airing the bedding.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.288
Where's Mom?

15:30.396 --> 15:31.590
Long gone.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.133
Put that stuff away
and take Dad his lunch.

15:39.238 --> 15:40.227
Me?!

15:40.439 --> 15:43.806
Why not? You're going to the library.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.235
Shall I go instead?

15:47.579 --> 15:51.743
And you'll clean the toilet, the bath
and the balcony and go to the Co-op?

15:52.785 --> 15:56.619
Don't forget to turn the bedding
and fix dinner.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.859
I'm going!

16:08.000 --> 16:09.661
Shizuku!

16:10.369 --> 16:12.360
Mail these, will you?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.699
What?

16:13.872 --> 16:15.999
M-A-l-L!

16:21.747 --> 16:23.476
You don't have to read them!

16:24.183 --> 16:25.980
Take the paper-clip off.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.543
Your boyfriend?

16:27.653 --> 16:28.779
Idiot!

17:25.644 --> 17:27.339
Hey cat... are you alone?

17:32.418 --> 17:33.350
Where are you going?

17:37.122 --> 17:38.612
What's out there?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.853
Hey! Answer me!

17:55.674 --> 17:57.642
I get off here. What about you?

18:02.147 --> 18:03.580
See you.

18:16.895 --> 18:18.419
Hey! A cat!

18:38.684 --> 18:40.242
The library's that way!

19:04.276 --> 19:08.303
And it felt just like
the start of a story...

19:44.383 --> 19:45.577
There he is!

20:10.509 --> 20:13.774
No Entrance

20:39.938 --> 20:43.305
What a hill! How far up is he going?

21:02.427 --> 21:03.826
Cat?

21:05.230 --> 21:06.629
Cat?

21:11.036 --> 21:13.436
Does he live around here?

21:45.537 --> 21:49.132
Hey, cat! Where are you going?
Do you live around here?

22:08.994 --> 22:12.930
I never knew there was a place
like this way up here...

22:32.184 --> 22:35.642
That's not nice!
Going around teasing dogs!

22:47.866 --> 22:51.165
Maybe you're teasing me, too.

23:43.622 --> 23:47.058
I never guessed there was a store
like this up here either...

24:15.987 --> 24:17.887
Cool!

24:25.997 --> 24:27.931
Are you that cat?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.404
Oh, hello...

24:41.513 --> 24:42.537
Um...

24:42.647 --> 24:46.549
That's all right. Look around
all you want.

24:46.852 --> 24:48.945
The Baron gets bored.

24:50.222 --> 24:53.020
Is this doll 'the Baron'?

24:53.124 --> 24:57.959
Yep. Baron Humbert von Jechingen.
Quite the name...

25:06.771 --> 25:08.898
Sorry.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.271
Thanks. I'm fine now.

25:11.376 --> 25:12.934
That's a great clock.

25:13.044 --> 25:16.707
It was sitting in some castle,
all rusted out.

25:16.815 --> 25:17.907
Look...

25:21.219 --> 25:24.655
It's beautiful. What is it?

25:27.759 --> 25:30.159
Wait and see.

26:10.435 --> 26:12.596
What great dwarfs!

26:12.704 --> 26:18.142
So you're a young lady
who knows about dwarfs, are you?

26:20.211 --> 26:24.113
Watch the face... if it works.

26:42.367 --> 26:43.231
A fairy!

26:43.335 --> 26:46.133
The light shines on the glass.
Come up here.

26:51.409 --> 26:52.637
A princess?

26:52.811 --> 26:53.835
That's right.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.947
Are they in love?

27:06.491 --> 27:10.860
But they live in different worlds.
He's king of the dwarfs.

27:11.529 --> 27:16.489
Only while the clock is striking 12
is she changed back from a sheep.

27:16.701 --> 27:20.398
But he appears every hour...

27:20.505 --> 27:22.166
...and waits for her.

27:23.008 --> 27:28.310
The artisan who made this
must have been disappointed in love.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.740
That's why they both look so sad...

27:36.421 --> 27:38.184
This clock's fast, isn't it...

27:38.289 --> 27:40.883
Only about five minutes, though.

27:40.992 --> 27:42.220
Oh, no!

27:43.395 --> 27:45.863
I've got to be at the library!

27:46.564 --> 27:48.464
Can I come back sometime?

27:49.200 --> 27:52.601
Sure... but go lef t
to get to the library!

28:04.516 --> 28:06.313
I'm right above it!

28:11.890 --> 28:15.018
What a find! A place
where stories start!

28:17.195 --> 28:18.628
Fantastic!

28:20.231 --> 28:21.528
Tsukishima!

28:21.733 --> 28:23.360
Tsukishima Shizuku!

28:26.371 --> 28:27.633
Isn't this yours?

28:33.411 --> 28:35.276
Forgetful, aren't you.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.243
Thanks... but how...?

28:37.348 --> 28:39.145
Guess!

28:41.553 --> 28:44.454
The cat! Is that your cat?

28:44.789 --> 28:46.950
You sure eat a big lunch!

28:49.194 --> 28:50.218
No!

28:50.428 --> 28:53.886
'Concrete roads, everywhere'...

28:55.233 --> 28:57.463
It's not mine! Hey!

28:59.971 --> 29:01.165
Oh, here you are...

29:04.642 --> 29:06.872
What's wrong with you?

29:07.378 --> 29:09.278
It's hard to explain.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.048
I felt like I'd found
a treasure hidden in a cave.

29:14.152 --> 29:16.882
Then what someone said
buried me alive.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.022
Sounds complicated.

29:21.459 --> 29:22.926
Getting more books?

29:23.027 --> 29:25.495
Seven more to go.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.088
Still at it? What about lunch?

29:28.199 --> 29:29.188
I'll buy something.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.825
You will? Thanks, then.

29:53.858 --> 29:55.553
June 16 th...

29:56.294 --> 29:59.627
Wow! Amasawa's read this one, too!

30:00.799 --> 30:02.858
What's he like?

30:06.171 --> 30:08.071
No! He's not you!

31:01.626 --> 31:04.026
Shizuku! Hurry!

31:05.663 --> 31:06.823
I'm late!

31:08.166 --> 31:09.258
Pass my umbrella.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.295
Rain every day this term!

31:16.274 --> 31:19.675
At least you're studying
because you want to.

31:19.944 --> 31:20.933
Sorry.

31:21.179 --> 31:22.840
Study hard!

31:22.947 --> 31:24.414
Don't you worry!

31:32.290 --> 31:33.188
Shizuku!

31:33.291 --> 31:34.223
Hi!

31:34.325 --> 31:35.917
Hurry! We'll be late!

31:37.462 --> 31:39.521
I hate all these tests!

31:39.631 --> 31:41.599
One every day!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.167
Did you answer?

31:48.273 --> 31:49.297
No.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.840
Did he say anything?

31:51.776 --> 31:53.334
I'm going to say no.

31:53.845 --> 31:56.939
Yeah? Maybe that's best.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.538
Sugimura!

31:59.817 --> 32:01.284
Better hurry!

32:01.920 --> 32:03.820
I know!

32:13.164 --> 32:15.564
Time's up. Gather the papers.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.535
See you this a f ternoon.

32:27.478 --> 32:29.469
Let's go see Miss Kosaka.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.377
Let me go to the teachers'room first.

32:31.482 --> 32:32.471
Sure.

32:32.850 --> 32:34.875
- Tsukishima!
- What?

32:34.986 --> 32:37.147
I lucked out on the test!

32:37.255 --> 32:38.415
Isn't that nice.

32:38.756 --> 32:41.418
Everything I studied was on it!

32:41.859 --> 32:44.225
So you're not just a baseball goof...

32:44.329 --> 32:48.425
Yuko's good at guessing, too.
Why not study with her?

32:49.000 --> 32:49.864
With Harada?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.936
- Hey, Sugimura!
- What?

32:53.237 --> 32:54.568
Come on!

33:00.178 --> 33:02.078
Stop fixing me up!

33:02.180 --> 33:03.204
Was it obvious?

33:03.314 --> 33:05.339
I never just guess!

33:05.450 --> 33:06.474
Sorry!

33:08.086 --> 33:09.519
Excuse me...

33:12.857 --> 33:16.122
A library-book donor?
Gee, I don't know...

33:16.427 --> 33:20.227
Sorry to bother you at lunch-time.
There's this stamp in it.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.994
Oh...

33:25.703 --> 33:28.069
That's Dr Amasawa.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.197
I've read it. It's a good book!

33:30.608 --> 33:31.836
Yes, very.

33:31.943 --> 33:34.707
What kind of person is he?

33:35.213 --> 33:39.115
He was chairman of the PTA
a few years ago.

33:39.217 --> 33:43.017
The PTA? Would you know
his given name?

33:43.121 --> 33:44.816
His given name?

33:44.922 --> 33:49.382
Mr Kimura, do you remember
that Dr Amasawa's given name?

33:49.494 --> 33:52.725
Dr Amasawa? It was 'Koichi'.

33:53.331 --> 33:54.730
Amasawa Koichi...

33:55.199 --> 34:00.398
His youngest son's in your year,
Tsukishima. You don't know him?

34:00.738 --> 34:02.638
He is?!

34:03.041 --> 34:04.633
Thank you very much!

34:06.010 --> 34:07.341
Goodbye!

34:08.579 --> 34:09.705
Sorry!

34:11.882 --> 34:14.408
Shizuku, where are you going?

34:16.420 --> 34:17.978
What a surprise!

34:18.089 --> 34:19.647
Tell me about it!

34:20.491 --> 34:22.891
What's with you?!

34:23.860 --> 34:25.089
Sorry!

34:34.572 --> 34:36.665
Hey, where are you going?

34:53.458 --> 34:55.619
He ignored me! Of all the nerve!

34:55.726 --> 34:58.593
Who is he? Where are you going?

34:58.696 --> 35:01.392
He's a jerk! He won't make me
avoid him!

35:04.235 --> 35:07.932
I've been carrying her lunch
all over!

35:09.440 --> 35:11.738
Tsukishima with a boyfriend?!

35:11.843 --> 35:16.246
Looks like springtime has come
for Shizuku at last!

35:16.347 --> 35:18.076
It isn't true!

35:18.216 --> 35:21.344
You met a prince
from one of your books?

35:21.452 --> 35:22.510
Is he handsome?

35:22.620 --> 35:25.180
I just want to find out what he's like!

35:25.289 --> 35:29.350
Come on, Yuko, you heard his name.
Tell us!

35:30.128 --> 35:31.095
Yuko!

35:31.462 --> 35:33.259
It happened too fast.

35:33.364 --> 35:37.300
'Ma', something, 'Masaki', maybe...

35:37.401 --> 35:38.368
Hmm?

35:38.970 --> 35:39.902
Hmm...

35:40.004 --> 35:44.873
But it's like Tsukishima to run out
without hearing the end of something.

35:45.042 --> 35:47.840
You want to know, but you don't...

35:48.646 --> 35:51.877
Your heart beats
in misery and ecstasy!

35:51.983 --> 35:55.146
How terribly romantic!

35:56.053 --> 36:01.116
Should you really tease a girl
who has just written your lyric?

36:01.259 --> 36:03.420
- You finished?!
- Let's see!

36:05.463 --> 36:09.627
O Shizuku! O great poet!
We will not transgress again!

36:10.902 --> 36:12.199
All right, then.

36:13.371 --> 36:14.633
I'm not sure...

36:16.440 --> 36:21.673
I don't know about old home towns,
so I wrote about what I feel.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.007
This is great!

36:24.282 --> 36:29.379
'Country road, this old road...

36:29.654 --> 36:34.591
'lf I go right to the end...

36:34.825 --> 36:39.762
'Got a feeling it'll take me...

36:39.864 --> 36:44.665
'... to that town, country road.'

36:45.203 --> 36:47.433
This is good, Shizuku. I like it.

36:48.139 --> 36:49.436
It's not hard to sing?

36:49.607 --> 36:50.801
We'll manage.

36:50.908 --> 36:55.174
We can give this to the juniors
and sing it at the teachers'thank-you!

36:55.279 --> 36:56.576
There, too?!

36:56.681 --> 36:57.511
Slow down!

36:57.615 --> 36:59.082
I like this part.

36:59.183 --> 37:03.449
'I left because I was alone
and I had nothing...

37:03.654 --> 37:07.590
'Pushed away my sadness
and pretended I was strong... '

37:07.692 --> 37:09.956
Ladies, the bell.

37:17.602 --> 37:19.832
The sun's come out!

37:20.238 --> 37:21.170
Shizuku!

37:21.772 --> 37:25.469
Come to the choir room!
We'll show them your lyrics.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.942
No, I'm going to the library.

37:28.045 --> 37:30.172
There's another test tomorrow...

37:30.648 --> 37:31.945
I'll study there.

37:32.049 --> 37:33.209
Bookworm!

37:33.884 --> 37:34.908
'Bye

38:11.789 --> 38:12.756
Harada...

38:15.860 --> 38:18.260
Can I talk to you for a minute?

38:28.839 --> 38:30.466
It's closed.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.242
Have these flowers been watered?

38:46.023 --> 38:49.959
Baron's gone... maybe someone bought him.

38:56.067 --> 38:59.366
World Emporium: Nishi Shiro, Prop.

38:59.904 --> 39:03.931
'Nishi Shiro'... maybe that jerk's name
is 'Nishi', too.

39:17.488 --> 39:20.355
Shizuku! Shizuku!

39:25.596 --> 39:27.223
Yuko's on the phone!

39:28.099 --> 39:29.964
You'll go deaf, Shizuku.

39:30.735 --> 39:31.895
Yuko?

39:32.470 --> 39:34.938
What? I can't hear you.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.408
I'll be there in a minute.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.568
'Bye.

39:41.345 --> 39:43.438
- Where are you going?
- Not far.

39:50.454 --> 39:52.046
What's wrong?

39:52.957 --> 39:54.288
Shizuku!

39:54.392 --> 39:56.917
What's the matter?

39:57.194 --> 39:59.287
What am I going to do?!

39:59.397 --> 40:05.131
The guy who wrote the letter got
Sugimura to ask me to answer it!

40:06.871 --> 40:09.431
Uh-oh...

40:10.741 --> 40:13.141
Why you, of all people?!

40:15.279 --> 40:15.973
Hey!

40:19.617 --> 40:21.881
That guy is so dense!

40:22.319 --> 40:26.415
But he doesn't know
how you feel about him...

40:28.426 --> 40:35.491
I'll apologize to him. But I can't go
to school tomorrow looking like this.

40:35.699 --> 40:36.996
And miss the test?

40:37.501 --> 40:38.468
Yeah.

40:39.303 --> 40:40.497
Oh.

41:00.057 --> 41:01.081
Idiot!

41:03.727 --> 41:05.024
What?

41:07.097 --> 41:08.428
It was easy.

41:08.532 --> 41:10.500
The library again, Shizuku?

41:10.601 --> 41:11.659
I'm going to Yuko's.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.828
Say hello.

41:22.346 --> 41:24.246
Tsukishima!

41:25.516 --> 41:26.744
Wait up!

41:33.591 --> 41:35.354
About Harada...

41:42.500 --> 41:47.870
...then she started crying.
Did I say something wrong?

41:49.607 --> 41:54.203
She said, 'Why you, of all people,'
didn't she?

41:54.678 --> 41:57.704
Yeah. A guy on the baseball team
asked me.

41:58.182 --> 41:59.672
No!

41:59.783 --> 42:02.911
She didn't want to hear something
like that from you!

42:03.020 --> 42:04.453
Don't you understand?!

42:04.855 --> 42:06.413
No, I don't!

42:06.891 --> 42:07.880
Tell me!

42:08.626 --> 42:13.290
You really are dense, you know!
She likes you!

42:13.831 --> 42:17.289
What?! No way! I don't need this!

42:17.835 --> 42:22.795
You don't? How do you think Yuko feels?!
She stayed home sick today!

42:23.374 --> 42:26.810
But... I like you!

42:27.177 --> 42:28.269
What?!

42:29.346 --> 42:31.712
Don't make jokes
at a time like this!

42:31.815 --> 42:33.043
It's not a joke!

42:33.150 --> 42:35.084
I've liked you for a long time!

42:36.287 --> 42:39.085
Not me! You can't!

42:39.490 --> 42:42.425
You don't like me? Or do you have
a boyfriend?

42:43.027 --> 42:45.188
I don't have a boyfriend...

42:46.297 --> 42:47.457
But...

42:47.998 --> 42:48.692
I'm sorry!

42:48.899 --> 42:49.593
Wait!

42:50.234 --> 42:52.099
Tell me the truth!

42:52.636 --> 42:58.575
But we've always been friends...
I like you, but not...

43:01.712 --> 43:03.976
I'm sorry. I can't say what I mean.

43:10.387 --> 43:11.979
Just friends?

43:14.825 --> 43:16.292
Forever?

43:21.665 --> 43:22.927
I see...

44:10.481 --> 44:13.177
I m the one who's dense!

44:23.994 --> 44:26.861
The parcel delivery lef t this with me.

44:26.964 --> 44:29.364
Thank you... again!

44:43.881 --> 44:45.906
You don't have to do this!

44:46.016 --> 44:48.541
We couldn't eat all these ourselves.

44:49.319 --> 44:50.650
Oh, you're home...

44:51.822 --> 44:52.652
Shizuku?

46:13.771 --> 46:15.432
Hi.

46:17.508 --> 46:18.998
Have you been shut out, too?

46:22.746 --> 46:26.204
Do you live here? Are you hungry?

46:29.953 --> 46:33.218
You're not very nice. Just like me.

46:36.093 --> 46:41.224
Why do we change, I wonder?
I was always so sweet...

46:41.865 --> 46:45.801
Books don't even excite me
like they used to.

46:45.969 --> 46:51.202
There's always someone inside me
saying, 'Things aren't that easy! '

46:51.508 --> 46:53.169
I'm not very nice.

47:18.535 --> 47:20.025
Hey! Tsukishima!

47:22.105 --> 47:24.096
Moon lets you pet him?

47:24.474 --> 47:26.465
Moon, you're not coming in?

47:26.610 --> 47:28.305
Is that his name?

47:28.412 --> 47:30.505
He's like a full moon.

47:30.814 --> 47:33.180
That's why I call him that.

47:37.487 --> 47:39.546
Isn't he yours?

47:39.656 --> 47:41.453
He won't stay in one house.

47:41.558 --> 47:44.823
I heard him called 'Ball' at one place.

47:45.128 --> 47:47.221
I'm sure there's others.

47:47.431 --> 47:50.093
So he does the rounds...

47:51.468 --> 47:54.062
Yes! He commutes, on the train!

47:55.038 --> 47:55.800
The train?

47:56.306 --> 48:00.800
Yes, by himself! That's how
I came here. I followed him.

48:01.345 --> 48:05.805
And he brought me to a neat store,
just like out of a story.

48:06.683 --> 48:07.809
I insulted him.

48:08.819 --> 48:13.313
I said he wasn't very nice.
Just like me.

48:14.024 --> 48:17.084
You're not like Moon at all!

48:17.661 --> 48:20.824
He's half-devil, he is.

48:28.805 --> 48:29.999
- Um...
- Would you...

48:32.442 --> 48:36.503
Is your grandfather sick?
The store's been closed and I thought...

48:36.613 --> 48:40.640
He's fine. It's a weird store.
He doesn't open very often.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.616
I'm glad he's all right.

48:42.719 --> 48:46.621
I can't see Baron through the window.
Did he sell him?

48:46.723 --> 48:49.988
That cat doll? You want to see it?
Come on.

49:00.704 --> 49:01.728
Close the door.

49:22.092 --> 49:24.356
It's like we're in the sky!

49:33.036 --> 49:34.060
Afraid of heights?

49:34.171 --> 49:37.072
No, I like high places. This is great.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.178
This is the time it looks best.

49:46.283 --> 49:47.215
In here.

49:48.305 --> 49:54.470
