WEBVTT

00:12.349 --> 00:15.060
So, we won the raid?
I guess that was obvious.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.062
Yeah, and who's the Captain?

00:17.062 --> 00:19.606
He calls himself The Soul Reaper.

00:19.606 --> 00:21.983
I'm not calling him that.
What's his real name?

00:22.401 --> 00:24.444
It's John. John Bartholomew.

00:30.909 --> 00:32.661
And how is John taking defeat?

00:32.661 --> 00:34.246
Not very well.

00:34.246 --> 00:36.415
- He says he's gonna shoot himself in the--
- In the head,

00:36.415 --> 00:39.584
but he wants to look me in the eye
while he does it.

00:39.584 --> 00:41.670
- Yeah.
- Is that common?

00:41.670 --> 00:43.922
Embarrassingly so.

00:45.924 --> 00:50.095
Hi, I'm Zheng Yi Sao. You're John?

00:50.095 --> 00:52.973
You! You've bested me.

00:52.973 --> 00:57.060
We will lock eyes
as I send myself to Hell!

00:57.060 --> 00:59.980
No. I didn't best you.
That's the Captain.

01:01.022 --> 01:02.274
You've bested me!

01:02.274 --> 01:03.984
No, no, sorry, bruv.

01:06.486 --> 01:10.824
Hi.
I know, it's been a day.

01:10.824 --> 01:13.285
Culturally,
this must be very hard for you.

01:13.285 --> 01:17.873
Anyway, go ahead and blow your brains out,
but your last act on this planet

01:17.873 --> 01:20.667
will be surrendering to a woman.

01:23.378 --> 01:25.172
Or we could have drinks.

01:25.922 --> 01:27.424
Champers?

01:28.675 --> 01:31.720
I'm just trying to keep my crew fed,
ya know.

01:31.720 --> 01:35.265
And maybe make a few bucks on the side.

01:35.265 --> 01:37.476
Sure, but they won't let you.

01:37.476 --> 01:40.103
The Spanish, the Dutch,
the fuckin' English!

01:40.103 --> 01:41.063
Fuck them.

01:41.063 --> 01:43.273
Everyone is cracking down
on the little guy.

01:43.273 --> 01:46.276
Like, hello? How's a pirate supposed
to make a living?

01:46.276 --> 01:47.527
She's incredible.

01:47.527 --> 01:49.780
She's got him eating out
of the palm of her hand.

01:49.780 --> 01:51.448
...speak for everyone,
but I didn't get into

01:51.448 --> 01:54.326
this business to fight other pirates.
Did you?

01:54.326 --> 01:56.745
No, no, no, no. I mean, I'll do it, but.

01:59.206 --> 02:03.335
What if we could all work together,
support each other, and

02:04.377 --> 02:07.005
I don't know, be

02:09.966 --> 02:11.176
- Forget it.
- No, no.

02:11.176 --> 02:12.886
- It's stupid.
- No, no! Go on, please.

02:12.886 --> 02:13.887
No, no, no, no, no, no.

02:13.887 --> 02:15.138
Tell me, what is it?

02:16.640 --> 02:18.517
What if we could be partners?

02:27.192 --> 02:29.361
I'll never forget it.
I mean, he was gonna blow his brains out,

02:29.361 --> 02:31.279
and then you close the deal!

02:32.239 --> 02:34.658
I think what John really needed
was someone to talk to.

02:34.658 --> 02:36.993
That's what I always say.
Olu, don't I say that?

02:36.993 --> 02:40.038
- No. No, no, you--
- The seas would be a happier place

02:40.038 --> 02:41.998
if we could all just talk it through.

02:41.998 --> 02:45.419
Well, yeah, and if we don't,
there's always the second option.

02:45.419 --> 02:47.629
- You mean if he didn't?
- Yes! This is

02:47.629 --> 02:50.632
a "join me or die" situation.

02:51.425 --> 02:56.721
I didn't conquer China by letting people
go on and on about their feelings.

02:57.973 --> 03:00.350
- Dire.
- So...

03:00.684 --> 03:03.019
Yeah, the Captain's got a bit
of a packed schedj, mate.

03:03.019 --> 03:04.730
I'm sure she does.

03:05.355 --> 03:06.565
This is weird, isn't it?

03:07.315 --> 03:08.191
Musical.

03:10.569 --> 03:12.154
We've come across another ship.

03:12.738 --> 03:14.156
Two in one day. Wow.

03:14.156 --> 03:15.365
Cap--

03:15.741 --> 03:18.785
Looks like it hit a storm.
Sails are pretty messed up.

03:18.785 --> 03:21.288
- No wheel.
- Poor buggers.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.539
Permission to board?

03:23.999 --> 03:26.501
-"The Revenge."
- Our ship.

03:26.501 --> 03:27.794
Ed.

03:28.420 --> 03:29.379
Ed!

03:34.634 --> 03:38.221
She's returned to us, mostly.

03:38.221 --> 03:41.266
Well, maybe she's gone
through that triangle thing by Bermuda.

03:41.266 --> 03:43.226
- Has anyone told--
- Ed!

03:44.770 --> 03:45.729
I'm here!

03:50.233 --> 03:52.194
Oh, my God. Is he unconscious?

03:52.194 --> 03:53.570
Ed!

03:53.570 --> 03:55.447
Oh, no. There he goes.

03:56.406 --> 03:57.282
Ed!

04:15.383 --> 04:17.385
Oh, God.

04:22.015 --> 04:23.016
Ed!

04:25.102 --> 04:27.062
Ed, are you here?

04:36.571 --> 04:37.989
Let go.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.084
Guys.

04:53.088 --> 04:54.172
Hi.

04:58.343 --> 05:01.096
I just don't understand.
Where's Ed?

05:04.724 --> 05:06.601
There's no good way to say this, Stede,

05:06.601 --> 05:09.062
- but w--
- Oh, shit.

05:09.062 --> 05:11.314
Is this Stede?

05:11.314 --> 05:12.816
Like, Stede-Stede.

05:12.816 --> 05:15.485
- Watch your breath.
- What does that mean? Stede-Stede?

05:16.236 --> 05:21.199
Nothing. I just thought you'd be, ya know,
taller, muscly, you know?

05:21.199 --> 05:22.617
- Charismatic, you know, like--
- Why?

05:22.617 --> 05:23.577
Why are you saying that?

05:23.577 --> 05:26.121
Just the way people--
This is good soup, isn't it?

05:26.121 --> 05:27.372
Yeah, it's very, very good soup.

05:27.372 --> 05:29.499
Why can't I get a straight answer
from any of you?

05:29.499 --> 05:30.584
Bonnet.

05:31.084 --> 05:33.587
- Good to see you.
- Piss off, Izzy.

05:33.587 --> 05:34.838
I don't wanna hear from you.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.631
Frenchie?

05:36.631 --> 05:38.341
- Yeah?
- Where is Ed?

05:39.968 --> 05:41.303
He retired.

05:42.095 --> 05:44.681
What? Why are you all
looking at each other?

05:44.681 --> 05:46.433
When you get old,
if you don't wanna work anymore,

05:46.433 --> 05:47.642
you can just give up, I guess.

05:47.642 --> 05:49.019
Yeah, I know what retirement is.

05:49.019 --> 05:50.270
Yeah, that's where he went.

05:50.270 --> 05:51.521
That's our answer.

05:51.521 --> 05:53.148
Retired. He is.

05:53.148 --> 05:54.274
Got tired.

05:58.862 --> 06:00.447
We should kill them.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.115
Any particular reason?

06:02.115 --> 06:04.034
I smell mutiny.

06:05.077 --> 06:08.246
I smell leather, B.O., so.

06:08.246 --> 06:10.332
You're compromised.

06:10.791 --> 06:13.794
You just wanna keep the soft one happy.

06:16.004 --> 06:18.173
I'll get to the bottom of it.

06:18.173 --> 06:21.051
What about my painting?
Why is it all stabbed up?

06:21.426 --> 06:22.761
That was me.

07:09.474 --> 07:10.892
Hey, Ruthie.

07:11.768 --> 07:13.603
If you're not gonna help

07:14.354 --> 07:16.189
at least keep up.

07:35.751 --> 07:37.753
Oh, fuck.

07:45.761 --> 07:47.179
You?

07:50.098 --> 07:51.641
Am I your hostage?

07:52.142 --> 07:53.727
No.

07:53.727 --> 07:57.564
What did you do to me when I was out?

07:58.106 --> 08:00.609
- Anything weird?
- No.

08:00.901 --> 08:04.321
Just making you some soup.
Make your body better.

08:08.492 --> 08:10.118
Captain Hornigold?

08:10.368 --> 08:12.996
Ben now. Just Ben.

08:14.039 --> 08:15.749
Open up for the cargo ship.

08:15.749 --> 08:18.919
Fuck you! I'm not eating that.
Fuck off. Fuck off!

08:18.919 --> 08:20.170
Hey!

08:20.170 --> 08:22.547
Listen, I know you've probably got

08:22.547 --> 08:25.092
some bad memories
starring your captain here.

08:25.092 --> 08:27.594
Last time I saw you,
you said you were gonna

08:27.594 --> 08:29.471
flay my skin and feed it back to me.

08:29.471 --> 08:32.599
Yeah, alright, alright.
That was messed up. I'm sorry.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.142
I can see you're agitated.

08:34.142 --> 08:35.644
I was in a bad place back then.

08:35.644 --> 08:38.063
Last time, I was too much
on the rhino horn.

08:38.063 --> 08:40.315
- You need your nutrients now.
- No, it's poison!

08:40.315 --> 08:41.566
- No!
- It's fuckin' poison!

08:41.566 --> 08:44.069
Alright, have it your way!
I've gotta get these nutrients into you.

08:44.069 --> 08:45.320
Now, come on!

08:50.033 --> 08:51.493
Shut the fuck up!

08:54.454 --> 08:56.832
A man was brought down...

08:56.832 --> 08:58.125
- What?
- ...here.

08:58.708 --> 09:01.420
- No.
- His head was smashed

09:01.420 --> 09:05.382
right on this spot.

09:06.299 --> 09:08.051
No, not ringin' any bells for me.

09:08.051 --> 09:10.095
Me neither, Blackbeard. Oh, no.

09:10.095 --> 09:11.596
- I mean, Auntie.
- Fang, shut the fuck up.

09:11.596 --> 09:13.515
Auntie. Auntie. Auntie.

09:14.975 --> 09:19.187
He was about six foot tall.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.482
Head of silver,

09:22.482 --> 09:24.693
- tattoos, short beard?
- Holy shit.

09:24.693 --> 09:26.319
How can you tell that from the taste?

09:28.238 --> 09:29.448
You're sweating.

09:30.198 --> 09:33.910
Aye. It's hot, ma'am.

09:34.703 --> 09:35.579
It's quite hot.

09:35.579 --> 09:37.247
- I'm burnin' up here.
- It's hot.

09:37.247 --> 09:38.999
Should we go and get us some
coolin' bevvies?

09:38.999 --> 09:41.168
- Maybe it's the weather.
- Maybe it is.

09:41.168 --> 09:44.629
Or maybe, it's the guilt

09:44.629 --> 09:48.550
that's building a raging inferno
within you.

09:49.885 --> 09:52.512
No, I don't think it's that.
What it is, is he had a quite serious--

09:57.684 --> 10:00.020
- Shit tits.
- Where are you going?

10:02.397 --> 10:05.275
- Fuck, that is refreshing.
- Yeah, innit?

10:05.275 --> 10:07.611
Stede said it's called eu-calyptus-es.

10:07.611 --> 10:09.446
- Euc--
- Eu-calamp-tus.

10:09.446 --> 10:11.656
- I know, it sounds made up, innit?
- Yeah.

10:14.117 --> 10:15.410
I missed you.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.498
- I kissed someone.
- What?

10:20.582 --> 10:22.375
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:22.375 --> 10:25.378
It was actually a lotta kissing.

10:26.421 --> 10:28.298
It felt weird not telling you,

10:28.298 --> 10:31.259
- you know, because we--
- No, no, no. It's fine.

10:31.259 --> 10:35.555
No, and you're kind of the best friend
I tell things to.

10:40.602 --> 10:41.812
I'm glad you did.

10:42.312 --> 10:44.231
So, go on. Who was it? Archie?

10:45.273 --> 10:48.318
- She's cute.
- I saw her boobs.

10:48.318 --> 10:49.861
Oh, okay. Nice.

10:49.861 --> 10:51.321
- Both of them.
- Okay, that's enough.

10:51.321 --> 10:52.656
I don't need any more.

11:25.230 --> 11:27.232
Don't cry, Bonnet.

11:28.483 --> 11:30.068
We just redecorated.

11:30.068 --> 11:31.570
I don't mind, actually.

11:31.570 --> 11:34.072
I think the knives really help bring
the place together.

11:41.079 --> 11:42.873
What'd you do with him?

11:42.873 --> 11:44.958
I know he wouldn't have left by choice.

11:44.958 --> 11:47.210
I know you think you understand him.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.379
He was either gonna watch the world burn
or die trying.

11:49.379 --> 11:50.672
So, which was it?

11:50.672 --> 11:54.926
Alright, Bonnet. Have it your own way.

11:54.926 --> 11:57.596
He went mad. He tortured the crew.

11:57.596 --> 12:02.684
He took my fuckin' leg 'cause I dared
to mention your fuckin' name.

12:03.226 --> 12:07.939
He was a wild dog
and we dealt with him like one.

12:07.939 --> 12:09.900
You sent him to doggie heaven.

12:16.448 --> 12:19.284
No, I could never do that.

12:19.785 --> 12:24.081
We deserted him on a beach
left nature to do the rest.

12:24.081 --> 12:25.749
More than he would've done for us.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.877
You and me did this to him.

12:28.877 --> 12:32.798
And we cannot let this crew
suffer any more for our mistakes.

12:32.798 --> 12:35.175
- Why would they suffer?
- If your captain senses mutiny,

12:35.175 --> 12:36.301
she'll kill us all.

12:36.968 --> 12:39.429
That's pirate code.

12:41.264 --> 12:43.058
Bet you're wondering how I ended up here.

12:43.058 --> 12:45.727
- Nope.
- What? Not even a little bit curious?

12:47.187 --> 12:49.940
Mutiny.
It's always mutiny. It's pretty basic.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.442
It's not that basic.
Mine was pretty intense.

12:52.442 --> 12:54.694
Really? That's what everyone says.

12:54.694 --> 12:57.072
- I sailed my ship directly into a storm.
- Yeah.

12:57.072 --> 12:59.074
I forced people to fight each other
to the death.

12:59.074 --> 13:02.536
Then I threatened to shoot a cannonball
through the mast and kill us all.

13:03.203 --> 13:04.496
Is that basic?

13:05.163 --> 13:09.167
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.
Layin' some heavy shit on me, bro.

13:09.793 --> 13:11.503
You worried you're insane?

13:11.503 --> 13:13.463
Yeah, a little bit.

13:13.463 --> 13:17.467
You know, I once fed
a cabin boy a live crab.

13:17.467 --> 13:20.887
Yeah, I was there.
That cabin boy's name was Felix.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.973
He was a really nice guy.

13:22.973 --> 13:27.936
And that fuckin' crab clawed its way out
through his stomach, and it killed him.

13:28.395 --> 13:30.856
Little shitter didn't
nick any more rations, though, did he?

13:30.856 --> 13:32.232
You don't feel bad about it, do you?

13:32.232 --> 13:35.861
Feelin' bad isn't gonna rebuild
a abdominal wall, is it?

13:35.861 --> 13:38.363
You gotta move on, man.
You gotta move on, ya know?

13:38.363 --> 13:41.116
Or you blow your brains out.

13:42.075 --> 13:43.118
Those are the options?

13:45.370 --> 13:48.707
Or we could just make some soup.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.668
Yeah. Soup.

13:52.377 --> 13:54.421
- Come on. Come on.
- Let's do soup.

13:54.421 --> 13:58.633
So, it was a mutiny.
At least mutiny adjacent.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.510
Well, they couldn't keep living like that.

14:01.094 --> 14:04.097
Ed can be quite troubled.

14:04.723 --> 14:06.349
Girl, how are you?

14:06.892 --> 14:08.810
You must feel so weird.

14:08.810 --> 14:10.604
Like, you're glad he is alive,

14:10.604 --> 14:13.857
but then he did all this evil shit
to your friends.

14:19.362 --> 14:22.699
Well, it feels pretty complicated, actually.

14:23.742 --> 14:25.744
And bad. It feels bad.

14:26.453 --> 14:28.872
I feel like I let him down.

14:28.872 --> 14:31.583
And that I'm the cause of a lot of this.

14:31.583 --> 14:35.670
Yeah, I should've
just told him how I feel.

14:37.005 --> 14:41.301
But I was scared and now here we are.

14:41.301 --> 14:46.098
I've dated my fair share of guys
on "Wanted" posters.

14:46.098 --> 14:49.601
They're hot,
but it always ends in a massacre

14:49.601 --> 14:51.853
and then the wrong people get hurt.

14:53.522 --> 14:54.940
Okay.

14:56.358 --> 14:59.361
Maybe we could avoid that happening here.

15:01.446 --> 15:04.241
I am feeling a little merciful today.

15:09.413 --> 15:13.041
Jackpot. I found the jackpot.

15:16.336 --> 15:18.588
Not a bad shoe, Hornigold.

15:19.714 --> 15:21.675
You ever thought about selling them?

15:21.675 --> 15:24.928
You can make them right here
out of your grass and shit.

15:25.345 --> 15:28.306
Everything's gotta have
an angle for you, ay?

15:28.306 --> 15:29.433
Nah, mate.

15:29.433 --> 15:31.601
I'm actually just a very simple man.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.146
I actually thought about opening an inn.

15:35.897 --> 15:38.066
No, really.
It's a pretty good life.

15:38.066 --> 15:39.943
You get to walk around with a set of keys,

15:39.943 --> 15:42.946
like a jailer,
but all the prisoners like you,

15:42.946 --> 15:45.031
and they can go whenever they want.

15:45.615 --> 15:47.117
Kinda like to see that.

15:56.251 --> 15:57.836
Are you going to turn around?

15:57.836 --> 16:00.380
Not until you ring the bell, sir.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.174
- You gotta ring the bell.
- Fuck's sake.

16:02.799 --> 16:06.261
Ding, ding.
Does anyone even work here?

16:06.261 --> 16:09.181
Hello there, sir.
Welcome to Jeff's Inn By the Sea.

16:09.181 --> 16:13.477
- How can I help you?
- Guess. It's an inn.

16:13.477 --> 16:18.023
- Why else would I be here?
- You're looking for a room?

16:18.023 --> 16:20.275
- Do you have a reservation at all?
- Listen, mate, have you

16:20.275 --> 16:22.277
got a room or not? It's not that hard.

16:22.277 --> 16:24.196
Okay. Don't have to--

16:24.196 --> 16:25.614
Why are you being like that?
Why are you being a dick?

16:25.614 --> 16:27.407
I'm not being a dick.
You're gonna have to deal with

16:27.407 --> 16:28.867
- customers like that.
- Okay, but Jeff's being really nice.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.577
Jeff's being polite,
and Jeff's offering you--

16:30.577 --> 16:33.080
You need to deal with customers
like me, alright?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.791
It's a people business, buddy.
Okay?

16:35.791 --> 16:40.879
That's right, you're not very good
with people, are ya, Jeff?

16:41.922 --> 16:43.507
Don't fuckin' push me, mate.

16:43.507 --> 16:45.133
What are you gonna do, Jeff?

16:45.133 --> 16:46.718
Are you gonna kick me
out your fuckin' inn?

16:47.427 --> 16:52.265
Or maybe you wanna strangle me
like you did your old dad.

16:54.768 --> 16:56.478
How the fuck did you know about that?

16:56.478 --> 17:01.525
Grown man covered in tattoos.
Ay? With daddy issues.

17:01.525 --> 17:05.153
- I never told anyone about that.
- But you did, though, didn't you?

17:05.737 --> 17:08.782
Kraken didn't kill my dad. I did.

17:08.782 --> 17:10.951
<i>And he left you.</i>

17:10.951 --> 17:12.702
Fuck you.

17:14.246 --> 17:19.084
And it all boils down to this.
You're afraid you're unlovable.

17:19.751 --> 17:21.837
<i>I'm not a good person, Stede.</i>

17:23.004 --> 17:24.756
That's why I don't have any friends.

17:25.090 --> 17:26.216
I'm your friend.

17:28.802 --> 17:30.595
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

17:50.073 --> 17:51.783
You're fuckin' kidding me.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.330
You can't kill me, Eddie.

18:06.339 --> 18:07.799
It's my favorite shirt.

18:07.799 --> 18:10.510
What the fuck is going on?

18:10.510 --> 18:12.596
They tried to cover it up.

18:13.722 --> 18:15.348
They've been lying to us.

18:15.849 --> 18:17.058
What?

18:19.311 --> 18:21.521
I told you they killed him.

18:25.859 --> 18:28.653
<i>I mean, clearly, it was him or you.</i>

18:28.653 --> 18:31.323
Sucks you guys are probably
gonna be executed tomorrow.

18:31.323 --> 18:34.993
Nah. We've been livin'
second-to-second for a while now.

18:34.993 --> 18:37.412
It's actually kinda
nice to have a deadline.

18:47.506 --> 18:49.883
Go on, Bonnet. Give me your worst.

19:05.941 --> 19:07.776
Alright, so am I dead?

19:08.193 --> 19:10.904
Not exactly. No.

19:10.904 --> 19:12.447
But I'm not alive.

19:12.781 --> 19:14.783
You're in the gravy basket, man.

19:15.492 --> 19:18.078
Always has been. Never was.

19:18.078 --> 19:19.913
You know, the nether realm.

19:19.913 --> 19:22.624
The inevitable, and yet the impossible.

19:22.624 --> 19:24.793
You're talkin' about purgatory?

19:24.793 --> 19:26.211
No. What's that?

19:27.337 --> 19:29.714
- I've been trapped between life and death.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it.

19:29.714 --> 19:31.758
- That's the shit right there, bro.
- Oh, fuck!

19:31.758 --> 19:33.718
But purgatory,
that's a shit way of saying it.

19:33.718 --> 19:36.471
- It's gravy basket.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

19:36.471 --> 19:38.515
So who decides whether I live or die?

19:38.515 --> 19:40.350
- You?
- Oh, fuck no.

19:40.350 --> 19:44.438
No, no, no. I don't want any of that shit.
This is on you.

19:44.438 --> 19:46.481
Okay, well, I feel like I'm gonna choose--

19:46.481 --> 19:48.984
I feel like I'm supposed to choose live.

19:48.984 --> 19:50.777
It's a judgment-free zone, bro.

19:50.777 --> 19:54.030
We can make a list of the pros
and the cons, ya know?

19:54.030 --> 19:55.782
What do you like about livin'?

19:55.782 --> 19:57.325
No, no. Don't think.
Don't think. Don't think.

19:57.325 --> 20:01.037
- Just, just speak it. Speak it.
- Yeah. Okay, warmth.

20:01.788 --> 20:04.207
Being warm. Good food.

20:04.624 --> 20:05.834
Intercourse.

20:06.626 --> 20:07.919
- Okay, gr--
- Orgasms.

20:07.919 --> 20:09.045
- Oh, okay.
- Not just intercourse.

20:09.045 --> 20:10.297
No, that's--

20:10.297 --> 20:11.423
It's gotta finish with the good shit.

20:11.423 --> 20:12.674
- Warmth, good food. Orgasms.
- Orgasms.

20:12.674 --> 20:13.925
Yeah. Orgasms. Okay, great.

20:13.925 --> 20:16.219
Three solid things. That's a good start.

20:16.762 --> 20:18.096
What about cons?

20:20.056 --> 20:22.267
I don't think anyone's waiting for me.

20:23.852 --> 20:25.061
Fuck.

20:25.812 --> 20:28.106
That's really fucked your pros up.

20:28.106 --> 20:30.400
Fuck. Yes, it's fucked them!

20:32.819 --> 20:34.821
You got a lot on your mind, man.

20:35.363 --> 20:36.948
You wanna come to my thinking spot?

20:36.948 --> 20:40.368
- You got a spot just for thinking?
- Fuck yeah.

20:40.368 --> 20:42.996
Now pick up my fuckin' staff.

20:42.996 --> 20:45.707
'Cause if you execute them,

20:45.707 --> 20:48.960
I really think you'll come to regret it,
deep down.

20:50.128 --> 20:56.593
I realize that this is complicated
by your boat-mance with

20:57.928 --> 20:59.596
- Jim, is it?
- No.

20:59.596 --> 21:02.724
- Yes. Yes, we did have a boat-mance.
- But what,

21:02.724 --> 21:06.937
what is the status of that?
Is it ongoing or?

21:11.316 --> 21:13.151
We're best friends.

21:14.486 --> 21:16.113
Yeah. Family.

21:17.239 --> 21:21.993
Someone I'd like to see grow old
just like all my other friends.

21:21.993 --> 21:23.703
So.

21:25.455 --> 21:27.999
Well, then how would this

21:28.792 --> 21:32.379
this execution affect

21:36.550 --> 21:37.759
us?

21:40.053 --> 21:41.471
What do you mean, us?

21:43.098 --> 21:45.600
I was trying to seduce you.

21:46.393 --> 21:48.437
Was that not clear?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.355
- No, it wasn't clear.
- My timing is--

21:50.355 --> 21:52.357
I thought you were gonna
kill me instantly, but.

21:59.197 --> 22:00.824
Towel service.

22:04.202 --> 22:05.620
This one has a smell.

22:05.620 --> 22:08.623
Ooh, yes. It's Chamomile.

22:10.375 --> 22:11.293
Night-night.

22:11.752 --> 22:13.545
Wee John, take these.

22:13.545 --> 22:15.839
- Okay.
- Stede, what's going on?

22:17.340 --> 22:18.717
We're taking back "The Revenge."

22:18.717 --> 22:20.385
Yes, Stedey-boy!

22:20.969 --> 22:23.764
- Stay low and meet me at the bow.
- Love a last-minute escape.

22:23.764 --> 22:25.974
Wee John, I'll need you to get a wheel.

22:25.974 --> 22:28.643
<i>Meanwhile, the rest of us
will secure an exit.</i>

22:45.952 --> 22:47.537
So, so sorry.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.838
We've only got one shot.
That's on you, Black Pete.

22:56.838 --> 22:58.048
Me? Why me?

22:58.048 --> 22:59.966
You've always said you got perfect aim.

22:59.966 --> 23:02.219
- I never said that.
- You say that all the time.

23:02.219 --> 23:03.470
- Yeah.
- You said it today.

23:03.470 --> 23:05.931
Come on.
The entire escape relies on this.

23:05.931 --> 23:10.018
Fine, I'll do it. Jesus.

23:17.109 --> 23:19.694
Just breathe into it, Black P--

23:26.618 --> 23:28.203
Nope, I can't do it.

23:28.203 --> 23:30.080
- I've never even seen one of these.
- Seriously?

23:30.080 --> 23:31.748
Oh, ya cockeyed--

23:31.748 --> 23:32.791
Come on. Give it here.
Give it here.

23:32.791 --> 23:33.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:33.834 --> 23:35.544
I don't know if I can trust someone
I don't really know.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.962
Blue jay, go for that.

23:40.340 --> 23:42.551
Look at that. See that, Black Pete?

23:42.551 --> 23:43.969
- Yes.
- Look at--

23:43.969 --> 23:45.512
- Yes, Buttons.
- She has good form.

23:45.512 --> 23:46.680
Thank you, Buttons.

23:55.814 --> 23:57.566
Yes! Okay.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.067
- Right. Who's next?
- Me?

23:59.067 --> 24:00.110
Fang. Okay.

24:00.110 --> 24:02.028
- Let's get two tea towels for Fang.
- Okay.

24:06.074 --> 24:08.201
Yeah, I am so, so sorry.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.501
- Frenchie.
- Yes?

24:16.501 --> 24:17.753
You get started on the riggin'.

24:17.753 --> 24:20.630
Roach! Come here and brace the yard.
Come on!

24:28.013 --> 24:30.640
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

24:33.101 --> 24:34.561
Shit!

24:34.561 --> 24:36.855
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

24:36.855 --> 24:38.482
- Where's Olu?
- Olu?

24:38.482 --> 24:40.192
I don't know. Go find him.

24:41.485 --> 24:43.987
Right, who's next? Oh, yes, the wheel.

24:47.991 --> 24:51.703
Maybe we could make them work off
the punishment.

24:51.703 --> 24:52.662
Earn your trust.

24:52.662 --> 24:54.372
Let's talk about it later.

24:56.458 --> 24:59.878
Hey, hey!
Yo, get your pants on. They're escaping.

24:59.878 --> 25:01.296
I've got my pants on.

25:01.296 --> 25:02.839
Move! Hurry up!

25:02.839 --> 25:04.508
- Alarm! Alarm!
- Did you know about this?

25:04.508 --> 25:06.676
- Know what? No, no!
- Fuck!

25:06.676 --> 25:07.761
Wait!

25:10.639 --> 25:13.141
- Fuck.
- Hey! We have to leave now.

25:13.141 --> 25:16.228
- What's going on? Are you escaping?
- We don't have time. Come on!

25:17.437 --> 25:18.438
Olu!

25:21.942 --> 25:23.360
Set the sail!

25:25.821 --> 25:28.532
After them! Right now!

25:37.624 --> 25:39.626
They stole the wheel.

25:46.007 --> 25:48.969
- I don't wanna say, "I told you so."
- Then don't!

26:04.109 --> 26:06.486
I just wanted to thank you for--

26:15.495 --> 26:16.913
You come here for clarity?

26:16.913 --> 26:18.582
It's too windy to think.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.002
Clarity?
You've made your choice.

26:22.002 --> 26:24.045
What are you talkin' about?

26:24.755 --> 26:26.465
Oh, Christ,

26:26.465 --> 26:29.050
- you just don't fuckin' get it, do ya?
- Oh, what the hell?

26:29.050 --> 26:30.886
Fuck, you're as thick as pig shit.

26:30.886 --> 26:32.888
I'm not me. I'm you. You brought me here.

26:32.888 --> 26:34.973
Why would I do that?
I hate you.

26:34.973 --> 26:36.892
I've always hated your guts.

26:39.686 --> 26:41.396
Here we go.

26:41.396 --> 26:45.108
So if you hate me and I am you, then...

26:46.485 --> 26:49.362
- I hate myself.
- Bullseye! Finally!

26:49.362 --> 26:52.657
Jesus! It took ya long enough.
Even Calico Jack would've had it by now.

26:57.245 --> 26:58.538
I'm not lovable.

26:58.538 --> 27:00.582
And you're scared to do anything about it.

27:01.458 --> 27:05.087
But old Hornigold, he ain't scared.

27:05.879 --> 27:07.631
Wait, wait, wait!

27:12.803 --> 27:14.846
You're welcome, ol' chum.

27:48.046 --> 27:52.050
You nut. Why'd you have to go
and get yourself killed?

28:09.317 --> 28:12.279
I messed up. I messed all of this up.

28:13.905 --> 28:15.407
I'm sorry, Ed.

28:16.783 --> 28:18.160
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:18.910 --> 28:20.245
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

28:32.174 --> 28:35.969
Ed! Ed! Wake up!

28:35.969 --> 28:39.931
<i>Wake up, Ed! Please, I'm here!
Please wake up!</i>

28:39.931 --> 28:43.643
Come back to me! Ed, don't die.

28:43.643 --> 28:46.813
<i>Please don't die. I'm here now.</i>

28:46.813 --> 28:52.110
<i>I'm here, Ed! I'm here! Ed! Ed!</i>

29:01.328 --> 29:02.829
Ed, wake up!

29:02.829 --> 29:05.665
Wake up! Ed, wake up.
Come on.

29:07.000 --> 29:08.877
<i>I'm here.</i>

29:10.962 --> 29:14.174
<i>I'll never leave you.
I'll never leave again.</i>

29:15.342 --> 29:17.761
<i>I'm here. I'm here.</i>

29:19.054 --> 29:20.347
<i>You're safe.</i>

29:31.400 --> 29:33.235
Come back to me.
