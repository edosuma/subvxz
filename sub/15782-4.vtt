18:37.574 --> 18:39.075
No.Look.

18:39.159 --> 18:42.829
You would tell him
there's no Spanakopita?

18:42.912 --> 18:48.251
You would break a lonely,
little boy's heart?

18:48.335 --> 18:49.836
[gasps]

18:49.919 --> 18:51.087
Billy? You awake?

18:51.171 --> 18:52.589
White, where are
you?

18:52.672 --> 18:54.424
What did that monster
do to us?

18:54.507 --> 18:57.260
B-Billy, the s--
the sun is coming up!

18:57.344 --> 18:58.803
Oh, my gosh! My god.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.263
You stay with me, White!

19:00.347 --> 19:02.891
I'll get you out of this!

19:02.974 --> 19:05.310
Too tight!
I can't get loose!

19:05.393 --> 19:08.647
Bubo? What the fuck?

19:08.730 --> 19:11.566
Pei Wie?
Why is he helping us?

19:11.650 --> 19:14.569
The albino code --
a covenant more sacred

19:14.653 --> 19:16.780
than his loyalty
to St. Cloud.

19:16.863 --> 19:19.157
Namaste, Pei Wie.

19:21.076 --> 19:23.161
Oh, here it comes! Hurry!

19:23.244 --> 19:26.206
Hurry, Billy! Billy! Hurry!

19:26.289 --> 19:28.500
White! Get with me!

19:28.583 --> 19:29.584
Aah!

19:31.294 --> 19:34.589
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.176
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
I think we have the winner!

19:38.259 --> 19:39.928
Yes, it arrived this morning,
George. Thank you.

19:40.011 --> 19:43.139
Yes, yes.
And may it also be with you.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.849
Can we get on with this?

19:44.933 --> 19:47.310
I'd like my crown
and my X-1 now.

19:47.394 --> 19:49.354
Where is boy Cyclops
and the ghost man?

19:49.437 --> 19:51.481
They're all... tied up.

19:51.564 --> 19:55.360
No, wait -- they were too
burnt out to join us.

19:55.443 --> 19:57.612
Okay, then everybody count up
your drachma

19:57.696 --> 19:59.572
and we see who win
crown.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.241
Useless formalities.

20:01.324 --> 20:04.786
Pei? Give him my Drachmas.

20:04.869 --> 20:08.248
Look!

20:08.331 --> 20:12.544
[panting]

20:12.627 --> 20:16.256
What the hell
happened to you?

20:16.339 --> 20:17.590
The winner!

20:17.674 --> 20:20.009
In your face,
St. Cloud!

20:20.093 --> 20:22.679
Oh, yay.
A Pyrrhic victory.

20:22.762 --> 20:25.640
You see, once I learned of your
duplicitous collusion,

20:25.724 --> 20:29.686
I arranged with Giorgos here
to buy Spanakopita.

20:29.769 --> 20:32.647
- What?!
- See you next year, "D"-bags.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.482
Oh, wait -- no, I won't.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.401
Come, Pei Wie!

20:36.484 --> 20:38.987
What?
G-Giorgos, how could you?

20:39.070 --> 20:40.947
Oh, Dr. Venture.

20:41.030 --> 20:42.574
We Greeks, we have a saying --

20:42.657 --> 20:44.534
"Why sell a man your best goat

20:44.617 --> 20:47.370
when you can just wrap up
spinach and feta in a phyllo

20:47.454 --> 20:49.456
and call it a goat
instead?!"

20:49.539 --> 20:51.166
[ laughing ]
You see?

20:51.249 --> 20:52.584
It's all Greek
to me.

20:52.667 --> 20:54.461
I think what he's saying
is, uh,

20:54.544 --> 20:56.171
the only thing
old St. Cloud owns

20:56.254 --> 21:00.008
is a couple million bucks
worth of spinach humble pie.

21:00.091 --> 21:02.260
So you're not mad at me
for winning your crown?

21:02.343 --> 21:04.095
No, Billy.

21:04.179 --> 21:05.764
There's always next year, right?

21:05.847 --> 21:06.973
ALL:
No fucking way!

21:34.542 --> 21:37.962
You see, Dr. Venture, is all
a big misunderstanding.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.965
Here -- take some olive oil,
uh, for your trouble.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.134
Well, like I always say,

21:43.218 --> 21:45.094
"Oil's well that ends well!"

21:45.178 --> 21:47.013
[ laughter]

21:47.096 --> 21:48.556
Indeed!

21:48.640 --> 21:51.226
Kano?
Take Rusty outside, would you?

21:51.309 --> 21:54.771
I'd like to compensate these
fine gentlemen for their time.

21:54.854 --> 21:56.606
Bye-bye, Giorgos!

21:56.689 --> 21:58.149
Bye-bye, Rusty!

21:58.233 --> 22:01.903
Horace?
Lock the door.

22:01.986 --> 22:03.029
Oh, no-no-no-no!

22:03.112 --> 22:04.864
No! Oh, no-no-no!

22:04.948 --> 22:08.368
[blows landing]

22:09.410 --> 22:14.457
[all groaning]

22:14.541 --> 22:17.126
Some day, Dr. Venture,
I swear...

22:17.210 --> 22:20.171
I will make you pay!

22:20.255 --> 22:22.632
[laughing]

22:22.715 --> 22:26.052
$2,002, $2,003, $2,004...
