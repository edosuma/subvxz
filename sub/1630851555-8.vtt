00:06.506 --> 00:10.927
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.011 --> 00:13.179
-I don't understand.
-Yes you do.

00:14.180 --> 00:15.557
You drugged me.

00:16.141 --> 00:21.062
Stop the damn car. What am I doing here?
You're insane and you need help.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.063
Me?

00:23.189 --> 00:26.901
You spiked my damn drink that evening.
And you raped me.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.529
You're nuts. Why would I do that?

00:29.612 --> 00:33.950
Because you're a damn sicko
that's turned on by helpless women.

00:35.660 --> 00:39.581
Memories come back in time.
I remember everything, Simón.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.333
You're signing a confession
at the precinct.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.837
-Stop the damn car.
-No.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.882
-I said stop the car!
-No!

01:29.297 --> 01:34.052
I thought the first call I got
was someone trying to scare me,

01:34.135 --> 01:35.428
so I phoned you.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.098
But…

01:39.432 --> 01:41.851
the Tenerife police phoned today

01:43.603 --> 01:47.565
to confirm that the body they found
is Manny's.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.192
I'm so sorry.

01:50.318 --> 01:54.572
I ran out of the grocery store
like a crazy person.

01:55.573 --> 01:58.660
I don't even know how I got here.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.831
When did they find her?

02:03.414 --> 02:06.501
Five days ago.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.213
They couldn't reach me.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.178
We sent her to the lion's den.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.888
Trust in God, Manny.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.309
-What if he doesn't believe her?
-We know Simón will be skeptical.

02:23.393 --> 02:26.271
But he won't hurt her
in front of his own family.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.773
You don't know him. He's a psycho.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.695
I burned her documents.
She couldn't travel.

02:34.445 --> 02:36.656
Maybe she had another passport.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.534
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.249
Susana.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.503
I need to know who phoned you.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.464
I have to make sure it's not a trap.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.133
Whose trap? What for?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.595
Manny herself.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.516
-It's a perfect chance to erase her past.
-Simón!

03:03.600 --> 03:07.145
What? It is a real possibility,

03:07.812 --> 03:10.440
especially now that we know
about her criminal record

03:10.523 --> 03:12.525
and that sleazy world of hers.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.445
Manny was no saint.

03:16.863 --> 03:22.243
But just because she was a stripper
doesn't mean she'd stoop that low,

03:22.327 --> 03:27.373
knowing I'd die of grief,
only a monster would do that.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.225
Hello.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.311
She's in her apartment.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.191
Part two of our plan starts now.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.330
Did you read those papers?
Marroquín's the guy you're after.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.331
It's not him.

04:08.414 --> 04:13.253
He's the right age, imagine the scandal
if we prove the next minister…

04:13.336 --> 04:14.671
It's not him.

04:17.131 --> 04:21.177
His daughter called, I was mistaken.
He never worked for Conaculta.

04:21.678 --> 04:24.097
Forget about the whole thing, okay?

04:49.497 --> 04:51.457
Javier's expecting me in Tenerife.

04:52.750 --> 04:56.713
I never thought I'd be glad
you had an ex-lover in the Civil Guard.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.133
Be careful, Mom.

05:00.216 --> 05:01.718
I'm more concerned about you.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.221
Making me go to Mass is my only concern.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.558
Have a safe trip. See you soon.

05:09.934 --> 05:10.768
Bye.

05:12.228 --> 05:14.230
Go, they're looking for you guys.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.786
Get dressed, you'll corrupt the poor kids.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.622
They said you'd help me.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.169
Who are you running from?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.090
This is my second time here.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.346
Caridad stopped the guy who used me
as a whore from killing me.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.848
He would have, trust me.

05:52.393 --> 05:55.813
A stun gun saved me
from the guy that tried to kill me.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.111
Men have dicks, not brains,
in their heads.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.656
Their heads are in their dicks.

06:06.866 --> 06:08.826
It's a good thing I like women.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.833
Don't you like it?

06:18.544 --> 06:19.879
It's beautiful, Pocho.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.550
You didn't use my money
for immigration fees, did you?

06:27.887 --> 06:28.721
Let's see.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.474
I don't need a ring, Pocho.

06:31.974 --> 06:32.809
Yes, you do,

06:32.892 --> 06:37.730
so everyone can see at first glance
that you're private property.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.190
There.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.070
It's okay.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.115
Ask Daniel for an advance
for your papers.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.826
He treats you as his own kid.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.494
He won't say no.

06:56.457 --> 07:00.920
No, I want to pay my sisters a visit.

07:01.003 --> 07:01.963
Again?

07:03.631 --> 07:06.426
-They are my family.
-I am your family, Matilde.

07:11.013 --> 07:11.848
Come on.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.476
Show me how much you like the ring.

07:20.857 --> 07:21.691
Come on.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.410
Today's special, please. Thanks.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.966
I rehearsed something, but…

07:47.049 --> 07:48.718
I asked you to stay away.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.971
I will when you explain
why you dumped me like that.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.598
I deserve at least that.

08:05.443 --> 08:06.861
I just can't, Federico.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.286
Valentina, please tell me.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.164
Are you protecting me?

08:19.373 --> 08:21.792
That would be
the least painful explanation.

08:30.384 --> 08:32.678
Figuring this out is driving me crazy.

08:34.055 --> 08:35.264
Is it something I did?

08:37.016 --> 08:37.850
No!

08:40.186 --> 08:41.312
Me neither.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.359
It's not our fault.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.072
So, whose fault is it?

08:53.407 --> 08:54.283
Fate's.

08:58.663 --> 09:00.206
You need to forget me, Federico.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.708
And so do I.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.925
One day you'll understand.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.686
The Canary Islands cops
are worse than ours, boss.

09:22.186 --> 09:27.817
I had to provide proof of some kind
of relationship or police investigation.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.361
Assholes.

09:33.531 --> 09:36.951
In any case, she's gone.
Romero saw her get on the plane.

09:37.034 --> 09:38.536
We must stay alert anyway

09:38.619 --> 09:42.248
to avoid any surprises
before my confirmation hearing.

09:43.499 --> 09:44.333
He's here?

09:45.001 --> 09:46.127
Show him in.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.837
Leave us.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.887
It's too risky a plan
just to get back at Marroquín.

09:57.388 --> 10:02.059
Getting proof to force him to confess
is not revenge, it's called justice.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.353
You didn't need to come.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.025
I didn't want you to think I was shocked,

10:09.734 --> 10:11.736
or traumatized or anything like that.

10:15.656 --> 10:17.074
Can you tell I'm tense?

10:18.492 --> 10:21.871
We don't know who we're messing with, Val.

10:21.954 --> 10:27.460
If he has inside contacts and I'm fired,
I'd put all of us at risk and…

10:27.543 --> 10:30.755
It's a miracle Manny's alive.
Keeping quiet is riskier.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.882
We really need you.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.518
-Count on me.
-Thanks.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.730
It's so late already!

10:49.148 --> 10:50.399
I need to go.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.737
Can you give me a ride?

10:58.783 --> 10:59.825
Sure.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.830
See you.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.999
-Thanks again.
-You're welcome, Val.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.591
Get me samples
of the documents Susana needs.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.093
I'll handle it.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.432
Matilde didn't come because of a migraine.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.851
I'm worried about her.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.399
You were with Federico.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.694
He went to the cafe.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.239
You're right, he knows nothing, but…

11:40.199 --> 11:41.450
I think he hates me.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.667
Stop crying over that broad, dude.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.505
Focus on your future, dude.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.842
Your uncle's financing the business.
That's awesome!

11:57.925 --> 11:59.552
We need to celebrate that.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.013
And also
that Tina's got the hots for you.

12:04.598 --> 12:05.433
Right.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.312
Drink up and cheer up.
We're lucky, things are going great.

12:24.076 --> 12:24.910
Thanks.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.711
Caridad.

12:35.004 --> 12:39.049
I didn't dare call you
because I didn't know what to say.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.303
It wasn't necessary anyway.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.139
I wanted to tell you…

12:47.475 --> 12:50.436
I understand why you regretted it, and…

12:51.854 --> 12:53.314
and that's fine.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.112
I don't know what happened.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.699
We are sisters.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.828
I guess you saw her in me in a way.

13:10.498 --> 13:11.499
I mean Valentina.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.460
I know you're in love with Valentina.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.088
And that's fine, seriously.

13:18.923 --> 13:22.343
No, I regretted kissing you
because you're a nun.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.805
And your reaction…

13:29.308 --> 13:31.852
I can't be in love with Valentina because…

13:33.145 --> 13:34.563
I keep thinking about you.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.152
I know I shouldn't say this

13:40.236 --> 13:44.365
because you're a nun
about to take your vows.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.492
And…

13:48.452 --> 13:52.164
And well, I'm a police officer and…

14:06.887 --> 14:07.805
Fede.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.918
Are you leaving?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.671
I'll just take a quick shower.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.108
DELETE PHOTO?
ACCEPT - DECLINE

17:28.255 --> 17:29.173
What's up?

17:29.256 --> 17:30.174
-Hey.
-No.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.343
Have a drink.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.141
Why did you want to see me?

17:40.142 --> 17:43.479
Can't I just want to know
how my brother's doing?

17:45.272 --> 17:46.190
Worried.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.068
Lots of work at the office.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.738
And my confirmation hearing
is coming up.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.075
What exactly is that?

17:58.911 --> 18:04.792
I've got 20 minutes to convince the Senate
that I'm the ideal candidate.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.547
No, I'm not making fun of you.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.718
I was just wondering how you went

18:14.802 --> 18:18.597
from wanting to be a movie director
to becoming an attorney,

18:18.680 --> 18:21.558
and then Justice Minister. Cheers.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.603
Says the wannabe singer.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.317
Realizing I had a squeaky voice
is what stopped me.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.570
But it was Dad who stopped you.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.912
How can you stand him after Mom died?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.165
If I hadn't left…

18:45.249 --> 18:46.959
What if you hadn't left?

18:47.042 --> 18:50.712
You still think Dad had something to do
with her death?

18:53.298 --> 18:56.552
She didn't need to hang a rope
from the roof.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.138
She discovered something devastating.

18:59.221 --> 19:03.684
She was depressive, dude,
and also a huge pill-popper.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.602
And I'll tell you, after you left,

19:06.186 --> 19:09.148
Dad suffered a lot.

19:10.858 --> 19:12.442
Maybe more than we did.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.530
No wonder you're his favorite son.

19:18.031 --> 19:19.449
Thanks for the drink.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.471
Thanks, Betty.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.518
-Okay.
-Hey.

19:47.853 --> 19:48.854
Claudio.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.400
Is everything okay?

19:54.651 --> 20:00.199
Yes, I just need an advance, please,
for my immigration papers.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.619
Why ask me and not Daniel?

20:04.244 --> 20:05.787
Did you guys fall out or what?

20:07.206 --> 20:10.042
Daniel hates Pocho.
I don't want him to think the worst.

20:10.125 --> 20:13.086
He doesn't hate him,
he just worries about you.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.630
But Daniel's not my dad.

20:16.757 --> 20:20.928
I'm very grateful
for everything he did for me,

20:21.011 --> 20:24.306
and I really love him, but…

20:24.389 --> 20:26.433
I know exactly what you mean.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.233
Fine, I'll transfer the money.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.569
Send me the account number.
Is 5000 okay?

20:38.362 --> 20:40.405
-Thanks.
-Sure.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.408
Were you on a binge?

20:43.992 --> 20:45.285
On a weekday?

20:46.870 --> 20:51.333
I took a friend's advice
about the hair of the dog that bit me.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.086
That doesn't work, dude.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.629
Time is the only remedy.

20:56.129 --> 20:59.341
You might not get over her,
but at least you stop hurting.

20:59.883 --> 21:01.385
Or move to another town.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.805
Is that why you moved to California?

21:05.430 --> 21:07.182
I've always been a merry bachelor.

21:07.683 --> 21:11.979
Barhopping is tough with a wife,
and I've never lacked company.

21:13.772 --> 21:14.940
Go ahead.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.275
Coming.

21:20.696 --> 21:21.530
No!

21:22.406 --> 21:23.740
Seriously, Federico?

21:25.867 --> 21:26.827
Hi, Catalina.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.330
Hi. I wasn't expecting to see you.

21:30.414 --> 21:33.208
We have a dinner appointment.
Remember?

21:33.292 --> 21:37.421
Right. Sorry. I'll take a quick shower.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.922
Coming, Uncle?

21:39.506 --> 21:42.301
I'd like to, but I have a meeting.

21:42.384 --> 21:46.596
Read those papers when you're sober
and call me if you have questions.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.726
-But take that shower now.
-Yes. He's my new partner.

21:54.688 --> 21:55.647
You look great.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.607
Thanks. So do you.

22:16.209 --> 22:20.672
Confirmation hearings are public events.
You don't need a press pass.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.383
I want to be in the first row.

22:23.467 --> 22:27.179
You know The Victims' Law
depends on the new minister.

22:27.262 --> 22:29.097
A pass is useless.

22:29.181 --> 22:33.101
Only the biggest newspapers
and politicians get first-row seats.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.355
You can cover it
from the unreserved section.

22:37.272 --> 22:38.774
It's no big deal.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.944
Excuse me.
I need to deliver this urgent report.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.489
Pedro. Can you do me a favor?

22:47.699 --> 22:51.370
It's ready. We just need to file it.

22:51.453 --> 22:55.791
I got you samples
of the death and cremation certificates

22:55.874 --> 22:57.667
issued by the Canary Islands.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.421
Are you repatriating someone's remains?

23:02.672 --> 23:05.675
I hope you finished the reform piece.
It's urgent.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.391
Cremation Certificate.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.909
I have the documents.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.453
They're not hard to forge.

23:33.954 --> 23:35.872
The seals take the most time.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.334
DEATH CERTIFICATE
CERTIFICATE OF CREMATION

23:39.960 --> 23:42.879
I saw the papers
the lady filed with customs.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.006
Don't worry, boss.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.092
-Are you sure?
-Yes, it's her.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.858
You were lucky this time.

24:04.609 --> 24:09.197
But luck is not a trustworthy ally.
I hope you learned your lesson.

24:12.617 --> 24:15.620
Please tell your sister-in-law
I have business to attend.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.022
Manny was a great woman.

24:43.231 --> 24:44.733
I'm sorry for your loss.

24:46.735 --> 24:49.279
You know you can count on me for anything.

25:08.924 --> 25:10.675
Simón Marroquín?

25:12.010 --> 25:14.930
No wonder Dad and Rosa kept quiet.

25:16.139 --> 25:17.766
So you knew the family?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.851
Not personally.

25:20.644 --> 25:24.356
But my dad was Rogelio's accountant
his entire life.

25:24.439 --> 25:28.109
We relied on him.
He even paid our college tuition.

25:29.236 --> 25:34.908
I never thought Rosa and his son
had an affair.

25:36.201 --> 25:39.996
They don't mix with the help.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.791
He didn't just mix with her.

25:43.583 --> 25:45.293
The bastard got her pregnant.

25:49.673 --> 25:54.261
But he threatened me, Dad.
He says if I don't get an abortion, he'll…

25:54.344 --> 25:58.515
You'll be fine, my child.
I'll take you to the doctor tomorrow.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.059
It's okay, honey. Don't cry.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.144
He made her have the abortion.

26:04.854 --> 26:09.025
Rosa quit her job afterwards
and moved to Cancún.

26:10.110 --> 26:13.530
She came back with you a year later
and married to Marcos.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.949
Didn't Grandpa explain anything?

26:17.617 --> 26:18.660
Never.

26:20.287 --> 26:24.541
You said he took her to a woman doctor.
Did anyone mention her name?

26:27.252 --> 26:28.086
No.

26:31.631 --> 26:33.925
Rosa never threw away Dad's papers.

26:40.223 --> 26:43.977
Here's a gynecologist Salgado
and her address.

26:44.060 --> 26:44.894
Let me see.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.231
"Dr. Salgado. Gynecologist."

26:50.525 --> 26:53.486
Why don't we fix something to eat
in the kitchen?

26:56.948 --> 27:00.702
Sure, but we need to hurry.
I have to have dinner with Pocho.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.996
He likes us to have dinner together.

27:03.079 --> 27:05.790
There are lots of gynecologists
named Salgado,

27:07.542 --> 27:09.753
but none at this address.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.589
-Let's make a list.
-Right.

27:12.672 --> 27:16.051
Isn't the other Juana coming?

27:16.134 --> 27:19.804
No. She's better off at the shelter
until it's safe.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.733
Mom, why are you here?
Didn't they follow you?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.361
No. They quit watching me.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.697
Simón finally believes you're dead.

27:45.372 --> 27:47.082
ST. JAMES CAKE

28:07.727 --> 28:09.604
I need a 30-minute break.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.314
Thirty minutes?

28:13.024 --> 28:14.818
How about 15?

28:16.778 --> 28:21.491
I need to make up for at least
seven years of everything I missed.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.249
You abandoned your calling for me?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.798
Would you feel bad if I did?

28:41.511 --> 28:42.679
Maybe.

28:43.847 --> 28:45.140
But I'd rather know.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.564
I want no secrets between us.

28:57.819 --> 28:58.862
I always had doubts.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.824
But I never dared to face them.

29:04.993 --> 29:06.453
Until you kissed me.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.039
You kissed me.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.834
I'm not that forward.

29:13.334 --> 29:14.586
You're not?

29:16.504 --> 29:21.009
What happened a while ago
makes me think otherwise.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.305
Just remembering…

29:35.482 --> 29:37.317
Why didn't you take my calls?

29:38.943 --> 29:43.156
Sorry, Pocho, I didn't hear it.
I wasn't holding it.

29:43.239 --> 29:44.115
Where were you?

29:44.741 --> 29:46.701
At Valentina's with my sisters.

29:55.251 --> 29:56.294
I'm sorry.

29:57.045 --> 29:58.505
I'm sorry, honey.

29:58.588 --> 30:01.633
See what you make me do
when you disappear?

30:01.716 --> 30:03.009
I'm sorry, honey.

30:04.052 --> 30:04.969
I'm sorry!

30:06.346 --> 30:08.640
I'm such a jerk. I'm sorry!

30:10.517 --> 30:12.852
I'm sorry.

30:14.854 --> 30:15.897
I'm sorry.

30:23.655 --> 30:28.660
All we need is the judge's decision,
but no one takes the phone in his office.

30:28.743 --> 30:30.703
-Judge Guillermo?
-Yes.

30:30.787 --> 30:34.707
Remind me to phone him tomorrow.
Will that be all?

30:34.791 --> 30:38.545
Sir, a lady wants the police
to launch an investigation

30:38.628 --> 30:40.713
of her mother's death 20 years ago.

30:41.339 --> 30:44.133
Twenty years? Isn't she a little late?

30:44.217 --> 30:46.886
It caught my eye
because she was a famous actress.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.096
Her name was…

30:48.930 --> 30:49.931
Nicté Mai.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.977
She died in a car crash,
no one suspected any foul play,

30:54.060 --> 30:58.565
but she claims she can prove
it was wilful murder.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.528
I'll refer her to another law firm.

31:04.445 --> 31:05.280
Nicté Mai.

31:06.155 --> 31:08.867
I remember her well.
We're the same generation.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.538
Tell her to come and see me.
You got me curious.

31:15.248 --> 31:16.082
Excuse me.

31:17.417 --> 31:21.838
I wanted to offer you a job,
but you can't refuse, I warn you.

31:23.006 --> 31:24.007
A job?

31:24.549 --> 31:29.304
Yes, I need help to run my new brewery,

31:30.346 --> 31:32.515
and Mom says you're experienced.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.562
Yes, I am experienced, but…

31:43.067 --> 31:45.361
I don't think that's a good idea, Fede.

31:46.654 --> 31:50.450
I'm still pretty devastated and…

31:52.952 --> 31:55.455
That's precisely why, Aunt.

31:56.581 --> 32:01.210
It would help keep your mind from it,
or at least distract you.

32:02.462 --> 32:06.549
After all I've been through,
I need people I can trust around me.

32:07.467 --> 32:09.052
People I know won't betray me.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.306
Come on. If not for you, do it for me.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.600
You'd help me a lot.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.025
I just couldn't refuse.

32:25.234 --> 32:29.197
He's a good kid.
That no-good woman broke his heart.

32:29.864 --> 32:33.117
And I need the job.
I need to make a living somehow.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.871
I know what's worrying you guys.
Me too.

32:37.497 --> 32:41.709
I know I can handle it
so he won't suspect anything.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.964
In fact, maybe sometime in the future

32:46.047 --> 32:48.424
he could even be our ally.

32:48.508 --> 32:52.595
No way, he can't know about this
until it's all over.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.936
There's something you don't know.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.234
NICTÉ MAI IS DEAD

33:06.317 --> 33:08.486
Thank you for seeing me.

33:08.987 --> 33:14.325
The other two law firms
didn't even let me explain the issue.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.956
I remember your mom very well.

33:22.333 --> 33:23.710
A very beautiful woman.

33:24.585 --> 33:27.588
The sad news of her death
was all over the media.

33:32.218 --> 33:34.095
Were you a baby at the time?

33:35.805 --> 33:36.639
Not really.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.017
I was four.

33:43.312 --> 33:47.233
The police said she died instantly
during the car crash,

33:47.316 --> 33:48.568
but she didn't.

33:49.527 --> 33:51.863
How would you know that?

33:52.947 --> 33:54.240
I was in the car, sir.

33:57.076 --> 33:59.162
I said stop the damn car!

35:02.433 --> 35:03.518
That man,

35:04.727 --> 35:06.813
whoever he is, is a coward,

35:07.772 --> 35:11.067
for taking off when she was hurt
and leaving her for dead.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.489
I need your help, sir.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.535
You are my only hope
to find my mother's killer.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.417
