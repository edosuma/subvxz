03:33.131 --> 03:34.424
- Nice watch.
- Thanks.

03:34.924 --> 03:36.801
- What's the water resistance?
- 200 meters.

03:37.093 --> 03:38.928
- And it's got a date display?
- Yes, it does.

03:39.721 --> 03:41.973
I might have gone for a metal strap
instead of a leather strap.

03:42.056 --> 03:43.182
- Really?
- Yes.

03:44.017 --> 03:45.518
I think I'd prefer a metal strap.

03:46.519 --> 03:48.688
I've had this one for years.
It's as good as new.

03:48.771 --> 03:50.815
- What's the water resistance?
- 100 meters.

03:51.107 --> 03:52.817
- How long have you had it?
- Nine years.

03:53.818 --> 03:55.028
A little bored of it, actually.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.989
I've been thinking of getting a new one
for quite a while now.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.200
Okay, this is what we'll do.
We'll go to the place where I bought mine.

04:02.619 --> 04:04.162
If I tell them you're a colleague, a friend,

04:04.245 --> 04:05.663
they'll definitely give you a discount.

04:06.164 --> 04:08.750
Both the owner and his father have been
patients of mine for some time,

04:08.833 --> 04:11.294
so I know them quite well. Think about it.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.809
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:27.977 --> 04:31.147
Sorry to keep you waiting. Ah, did you eat?

04:31.564 --> 04:32.899
I just had some apple pie.

04:33.816 --> 04:36.986
Do you mind if I go grab something
to eat before we go? I'm starving.

04:37.070 --> 04:38.154
Sure. No problem.

04:39.030 --> 04:41.324
Are you sure you don't want anything?
Chicken wings or...

04:41.407 --> 04:44.327
No, thanks, I'm fine. Do you have money?
I can give you some.

04:44.410 --> 04:46.829
No, I've got money, thanks.
I'll be right back.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.476
- Did you get a haircut?
- Do you like it?

05:09.769 --> 05:10.728
Looks great.

05:14.399 --> 05:15.858
Aren't you going to eat your fries?

05:16.192 --> 05:18.361
- I'm saving them till last.
- Why?

05:19.237 --> 05:21.531
I really like fries.
I always save them for last.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.491
I do that, too.

05:38.297 --> 05:41.217
- Sorry I was late today, Steven.
- It doesn't matter.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.845
I was over at a friend's house.

05:44.429 --> 05:46.681
He got a new motorcycle.
I wanted to check it out.

05:47.724 --> 05:50.977
He took me for a ride. That's why I was late.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.729
It's fine.

05:53.896 --> 05:55.732
He even let me ride it for a little bit.

05:56.649 --> 05:57.900
I hope you were wearing helmets.

05:58.234 --> 06:02.155
Yeah, of course we were.
We weren't going very fast anyway.

06:12.165 --> 06:13.332
I got you a present.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.919
Oh, thank you very much. What is it?

06:17.962 --> 06:19.422
What is it?

06:26.095 --> 06:27.346
It's very nice.

06:29.474 --> 06:30.683
Can I give you a hug?

06:34.937 --> 06:36.105
Thank you very much.

06:45.782 --> 06:48.242
- That's fantastic.
- It's water resistant

06:48.326 --> 06:50.787
- up to 200 meters.
- Does this come off?

06:51.496 --> 06:52.663
I prefer a leather strap.

06:52.872 --> 06:56.042
It comes off, yes.
You can put on any strap you like.

06:57.001 --> 06:59.712
But metal are more hard-wearing,
that's why I got you the metal strap.

06:59.796 --> 07:01.047
It's more expensive, too.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.052
- Hey, Dad.
- Hmm!

07:06.135 --> 07:07.845
Do you remember Claire,
my friend from school?

07:08.721 --> 07:10.348
- Yes.
- It's her birthday

07:10.431 --> 07:12.558
and she's having
a party in two weeks, at her place.

07:12.934 --> 07:16.187
- Most of the class are invited. Can I go?
- We'll see.

07:17.355 --> 07:20.900
Dad, if Kim goes to the party,
can I go with her?

07:21.526 --> 07:22.443
I don't know, darling.

07:22.527 --> 07:24.237
Your mother and I will discuss it
and we'll see.

07:24.654 --> 07:27.490
I'd say they can go.
Claire is a very nice girl.

07:27.573 --> 07:29.450
She's the girl you met at the mall
with her parents

07:29.534 --> 07:31.160
who asked about becoming a doctor.

07:31.744 --> 07:33.538
She's the one who wants to be a cardiologist.

07:34.288 --> 07:35.748
Yes, I remember.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.709
How was work today?

07:40.711 --> 07:43.047
Fine. How about you?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.967
I've decided to make some changes
at the clinic.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.720
I think I'm gonna get it painted
and buy a new couch.

07:50.388 --> 07:52.348
Look at you all hunched over like that.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.726
How many times do I have to tell you,
you'll strain your back?

07:56.394 --> 07:58.646
Your hair is practically trailing
in your food.

07:58.729 --> 08:02.316
Bob, you promised me you'd get a haircut
and you still haven't done it.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.485
- I'll get a haircut.
- Tomorrow.

08:06.571 --> 08:08.739
Not tomorrow, Dad. After the party.

08:10.533 --> 08:13.494
I like his hair long. He has lovely hair.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.664
- What about mine?
- You have lovely hair, too.

08:17.123 --> 08:18.499
We all have lovely hair.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.753
I bought that dress that you liked.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.090
I'll wear it for you tomorrow.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.510
I can't show it to you now, it needed
alterations. I'm picking it up tomorrow.

08:29.969 --> 08:32.304
- The black one?
- It was the black one you liked,

08:32.388 --> 08:33.806
- wasn't it?
- Yes.

08:34.056 --> 08:37.476
The other one looked great on you, too.
But I think the black one was perfect.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.852
I'm worried it's a little too short.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.895
I'd like it better if it were below the knee.

08:41.105 --> 08:43.691
You look amazing,
however long or short the dress is.

08:44.442 --> 08:47.945
Tomorrow I'm gonna bake a lemon cake
and nobody's gonna eat any of it but you.

08:48.404 --> 08:49.530
Not even the kids?

08:50.156 --> 08:52.700
- Not even the kids.
- Poor kids.

08:53.159 --> 08:57.038
Did I tell you Bob announced the other day
that he wants to be an ophthalmologist?

08:57.121 --> 08:58.289
Yes, you did.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.333
Bob would be a coal miner
if you were one, too.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.336
Could you turn on some more light, please?

09:15.306 --> 09:16.432
General anesthetic?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.225
General anesthetic.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.467
How's that?

09:53.344 --> 09:54.261
Perfect.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.218
- Martin.
- Yeah.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.601
Look, I've told you, best not to come
to the hospital without calling me first.

11:24.101 --> 11:28.147
I know, you're right. I'm sorry.
I just wanted to thank you again.

11:28.647 --> 11:31.066
And to show you my new strap
I got for my watch.

11:31.525 --> 11:35.654
I, uh, exchanged the, uh, metal strap
for a leather one.

11:37.281 --> 11:40.910
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put you
in this awkward position.

11:42.953 --> 11:43.954
Goodbye.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.374
Martin. Come here.

11:49.543 --> 11:50.961
What kind of strap did you get?

11:51.170 --> 11:52.922
- Brown leather.
- Show me.

11:56.217 --> 11:57.676
- It's very nice.
- You think so?

11:57.760 --> 11:59.678
- Or are you just saying that?
- No, I really like it.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.891
Next time you want to come here,
please call me first. You have my number.

12:04.475 --> 12:05.643
It's for your own good.

12:06.227 --> 12:08.896
I might be with a patient, or in surgery,
or in a meeting.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.482
There's no point in you waiting around
if I can't see you.

12:11.690 --> 12:13.234
It's for your own... Good morning.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.402
Good morning, Steven,
I have those test results.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.112
Shall I leave them on the desk?

12:17.196 --> 12:18.447
Please do. Yeah, I'll take a look at them

12:18.531 --> 12:19.406
- in a minute.
- All right.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.783
We've got the same watch.

12:22.034 --> 12:23.035
Let me introduce you.

12:23.953 --> 12:28.123
This young man, is one of my daughter's
school mates.

12:29.542 --> 12:32.461
I ran into Martin and his parents
at the mall last week.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.089
He told me he's very interested in medicine.

12:35.881 --> 12:37.633
- He wants to be cardiologist.
- Ah...

12:38.467 --> 12:39.969
I suggested he stop by sometime...

12:41.095 --> 12:43.222
so he can see what being
a doctor's really about.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.850
Martin, this is Matthew.
Great friend of mine.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.768
And an excellent anesthesiologist.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.812
That's great.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.107
Nice to meet you.

12:54.191 --> 12:57.528
Nice to meet you, too.
Let me know when you're ready.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.368
I've got to go back in now.

13:05.077 --> 13:07.079
We'll talk on the phone to arrange
our next meeting. All right?

13:07.162 --> 13:08.414
Okay. Goodbye.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.448
I think your breathing's really
improved over the last three months.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.909
That's what the choir director said, too.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.744
Did you tell her to move
you closer to the front?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.330
Yes, I did.
She said she'd see what she can do.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.332
Bob, did you water the plants?

13:51.874 --> 13:53.083
Mum said she would water them.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.460
Your mother works very hard.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.087
That's why we said it would be nice
to help out all that we can.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.465
And we agreed that Kim would take care
of walking the dog.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.300
And you would take care of the plants.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.638
How about I walk the dog
and Kim can do the plants?

14:06.305 --> 14:08.724
You're too young to be wandering
around at night, by yourself.

14:10.935 --> 14:12.978
- Thanks for the brush.
- You're welcome.

14:14.063 --> 14:15.230
We have to go.

14:16.732 --> 14:19.276
Tell Bob to water the plants now
that the sun has gone down.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.904
I watered them already.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.032
- Goodnight, darling.
- Goodnight.

14:38.796 --> 14:42.341
A full 40 years have passed
since the German cardiologist,

14:42.424 --> 14:46.011
Andreas Gruentzig, performed
the first coronary angioplasty

14:46.345 --> 14:49.515
on September 16th, 1977.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.686
Today, that first patient
is still alive and well.

14:53.769 --> 14:57.189
Doctor Gruentzig, however,
had an unfortunate accident

14:57.564 --> 14:59.900
and met with an untimely end.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.570
In short, he is one of those rare cases
where we can say:

15:04.154 --> 15:05.823
"The operation was a success...

15:06.782 --> 15:07.783
but, unfortunately,

15:08.492 --> 15:11.745
the doctor didn't make it".

15:15.708 --> 15:20.004
In the four decades that have passed
since that first coronary angioplasty,

15:20.087 --> 15:21.171
many things have changed.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.967
A new wave of techniques
and scientific breakthroughs have...

15:25.050 --> 15:27.011
I'm going for a cigarette.
I'll be at the bar.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.430
- Okay.
- ...endovascular aortic surgery

15:29.847 --> 15:32.683
and new treatments
for heart failure that include

15:32.766 --> 15:36.729
stem cell therapy, left ventricular
remodeling and, by all indications,

15:36.812 --> 15:40.065
the rapidly expanding use
of mechanical circulatory support.

15:41.275 --> 15:43.444
The guy that made it told me what was in it.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.739
And now I can't remember now,
but it is very refreshing.

15:47.489 --> 15:49.742
- Would you like one?
- No, thank you.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.870
Just try it. It's really delicious.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.830
You can use this straw. I haven't touched it.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.291
He hasn't had a drink in three years.

15:57.875 --> 16:01.128
- High GGTs and elevated transaminases.
- Oh, good on you

16:01.211 --> 16:02.296
for not drinking.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.923
Well, I wouldn't say no
to a cocktail if you're offering.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.592
Of course. I'll get you one right away.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.761
- We should go soon.
- Yeah.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.846
- It's early.
- He's got surgery in the morning.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.848
- He needs to get some sleep.
- It's still early.

16:13.057 --> 16:14.224
We've got surgery in the morning.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.225
Fine, okay.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.687
- How are the kids?
- They're doing very well.

16:18.771 --> 16:22.399
Bob has started piano lessons.
The teacher says he's very talented.

16:22.983 --> 16:25.319
Now we have to get him one
so he can practice at home.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.072
I just haven't gotten around to it yet.
I'm renovating the clinic.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.866
- I'm on the phone all day.
- Our daughter started menstruating

16:30.949 --> 16:32.868
- last week.
- Great.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.245
Yes, she was a little scared
but she's okay now.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.664
- You haven't seen her in ages.
- Not since last summer

16:37.748 --> 16:38.791
at the school choir...

16:39.208 --> 16:40.084
recital.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.294
You and Mary should come
over one night for dinner.

16:42.795 --> 16:45.798
You really shouldn't stay late, either.
Drink that cocktail you've ordered.

16:45.881 --> 16:48.008
Get yourself home.
You've gotta be at the hospital

16:48.092 --> 16:51.386
- in six hours. Time to go, darling?
- Yes.

16:51.470 --> 16:52.930
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Matthew.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.769
- Oh, it was a good night.
- I think so.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.154
Do you have many friends?

17:10.280 --> 17:11.323
Not that many.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.202
I don't think people can have
a lot of friends.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.538
I mean, it's difficult.

17:19.205 --> 17:23.042
The most important thing in life is
to have good friends, not lots of friends.

17:25.796 --> 17:26.964
That's what my dad used to say.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.926
- Your father was absolutely right.
- Yes, I know.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.055
I have a very good friend
who plays basketball in school.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.391
Sometimes we play it together.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.063
I also consider my mom to be a friend.

17:44.273 --> 17:47.317
I know it might sound strange
but ever since my father died, we...

17:47.401 --> 17:50.237
we... we've been very close, me and my mom.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.950
We talk about things. Lots of things.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.245
She helps me as much as she can
with a lot of stuff.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.372
I help her too.

18:03.417 --> 18:06.420
I'd like to ask you a favor.
Only if you want to, of course.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.173
I don't want you
to feel pressured or obliged.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.050
It just seemed to me like
a good idea, so I thought I'd ask.

18:14.553 --> 18:18.223
I'd like you to come by my house one day
to meet my wife and children.

18:20.017 --> 18:22.936
I think you'll get along great.
What do you think?

18:44.708 --> 18:46.418
Good afternoon. You must be Martin.

18:46.668 --> 18:50.505
- That's right. You must be Anna.
- That's right.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.635
These flowers are for you.
Your husband told me you like orchids,

18:54.718 --> 18:58.722
but I couldn't find
any fresh cut ones so I brought you roses.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.599
How do you like roses?

19:01.016 --> 19:04.519
Thank you very much, Martin.
I love roses. That's very kind of you.

19:05.520 --> 19:09.483
Come on in.
Steven is waiting for you in the yard.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.328
- This is Bob.
- Very nice to meet you.

19:22.162 --> 19:23.205
And this is Kim.

19:23.664 --> 19:26.625
Very nice to meet you.
I brought you some little gifts.

19:26.917 --> 19:28.168
That's very kind of you.

19:28.794 --> 19:32.673
It's a key ring with a musical note on it
for Kim because I know she likes music.

19:34.967 --> 19:37.302
And one with a smiley face for Bob.

19:38.595 --> 19:41.181
- What do we say, Bob?
- Thanks.

19:43.934 --> 19:44.851
How lovely...

19:46.061 --> 19:48.355
Well, we should probably eat.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.941
- Are you hungry, Martin?
- I'm starving.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.948
How long have you been in the choir, Kim?

19:58.907 --> 20:02.786
Two years. Since I was 12.
Do you like singing?

20:03.578 --> 20:06.623
I love it, but I haven't got
a very good voice.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.794
- How old are you?
- 16.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.089
Have you got hair under your arms yet?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.883
- Yes.
- I just got my first period.

20:21.513 --> 20:24.433
- Do you mind if I light a cigarette?
- You'd better not.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.144
It's all right. Just go over by the window.

20:38.488 --> 20:39.948
Can you sing us something?

20:41.283 --> 20:42.826
What, now?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.494
Yes. Anything you like.

20:45.287 --> 20:46.872
No. Not right now.

20:47.873 --> 20:51.752
- She's embarrassed.
- No, I'm not. Just don't feel like it.

20:53.003 --> 20:54.421
When did you start smoking?

20:54.963 --> 20:57.883
About eight months ago.
I was over at a friend's place.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.634
It was a party, actually.

21:00.344 --> 21:04.014
And this girl offered me a cigarette
and I said, "Why not," and lit up.

21:07.017 --> 21:08.977
That was a mistake. I regret it.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.856
But it's too late now. I'm addicted.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.151
Can you show me the hair under your arms?

21:17.027 --> 21:17.944
Sure.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.075
You haven't got that much.

21:24.076 --> 21:25.702
Have you seen how hairy my dad is?

21:26.453 --> 21:27.371
No.

21:27.537 --> 21:30.374
He's got three times more hair than you do.

21:32.834 --> 21:36.088
- You've got a great body.
- Thanks.

21:40.175 --> 21:43.220
Do you wanna go out for a walk?
It's a nice day.

21:45.680 --> 21:47.391
I'd rather stay here and listen to music.

21:49.476 --> 21:53.355
- Is that my MP3 player or yours?
- Mine, and don't you dare take

21:53.438 --> 21:54.398
this one and lose it, too.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.234
What kind of music do you listen to?

21:57.984 --> 22:02.739
- All kinds.
- I'm into metal and punk. What about you?

22:03.281 --> 22:05.909
I think it's worth listening
to all kinds of music.

22:07.035 --> 22:09.037
Depends on my mood and what I'm doing.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.207
I'll come for a walk with you if you want.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.876
We can take the dog with us
if you don't mind.

22:15.961 --> 22:18.422
I'd prefer it if it was just the two of us.

22:19.297 --> 22:21.007
I get nervous around dogs...

22:22.050 --> 22:25.137
in case they get into a fight
with another dog.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.473
The idea of separating dogs fighting
scares me.

22:40.986 --> 22:45.031
<i># We... We don't have
to worry about nothing #</i>

22:46.491 --> 22:48.201
<i># 'Cause we got the fire #</i>

22:48.493 --> 22:51.371
<i># And we're burning #
# one hell of a somethin' #</i>

22:53.832 --> 22:54.749
<i># They #</i>

22:55.667 --> 23:00.922
<i># They're gonna see us from outer space #
# Outer space, light it up #</i>

23:02.048 --> 23:06.219
<i># Like we're the source #
# Of the human race, human race #</i>

23:07.679 --> 23:13.560
<i># When the lights started out #
# They don't know what they heard #</i>

23:14.019 --> 23:19.941
<i># Strike the match, play it loud #
# Giving love to the world #</i>

23:20.442 --> 23:26.198
<i># We'll be raising our hands #
# Shining up to the sky #</i>

23:26.615 --> 23:32.204
<i># 'Cause we got the fire, fire, fire #
# Yeah, we got the fire, fire, fire #</i>

23:32.579 --> 23:35.790
<i># And we're gonna let it burn #
# burn, burn, burn #</i>

23:36.041 --> 23:39.085
<i># We're gonna let it burn #
# burn, burn, burn #</i>

23:39.294 --> 23:42.422
<i># We're gonna let it burn #
# burn, burn, burn #</i>

23:42.506 --> 23:45.509
<i># We're gonna let it burn #
# burn, burn, burn #</i>

23:46.885 --> 23:51.431
<i># We can light it up, up, up #
# So they can put it out, out, out #</i>

23:54.643 --> 23:56.186
Is this homemade lemonade?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.647
- Yes.
- It's amazing.

23:59.439 --> 24:03.026
My mom makes lemonade, too.
She hasn't made it in a while, though.

24:03.235 --> 24:06.613
I'll ask her to make some. I love lemonade.

24:08.073 --> 24:12.202
I'd like to meet your mother.
And we can have a lemonade contest.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.037
She'd like that.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.874
The kids' rooms are amazing.
So big and bright.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.336
You're welcome to spend the night
if you want.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.464
We can easily fit a mattress
on the floor next to Bob's bed.

24:24.923 --> 24:27.759
You two can hang out in the morning
and I'll drop you home tomorrow afternoon.

24:28.093 --> 24:30.345
Thank you very much, but I'd rather not.

24:30.971 --> 24:34.266
I gotta get home tonight.
I don't like leaving my mom by herself.

24:36.101 --> 24:39.271
- Whatever you want.
- Where did you two go?

24:40.313 --> 24:43.316
- Just for a walk.
- I love this neighborhood.

24:43.984 --> 24:46.319
So quiet, clean, beautiful.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.780
Where do you live, Martin?

24:49.322 --> 24:53.076
We live in a not-so-nice neighborhood
in a not-so-nice house.

24:54.077 --> 24:55.745
Up... up... uh, up north.

24:59.124 --> 25:02.544
- What a charming boy.
- Isn't he?

25:04.671 --> 25:08.341
Yes, very. How did his father die?

25:09.884 --> 25:14.180
Car crash. Driving home.
Smashed into a pole. Killed instantly.

25:15.765 --> 25:16.975
How long have you known him?

25:17.809 --> 25:20.270
Quite some time.
He was a patient of mine years ago.

25:22.897 --> 25:25.900
- Did you go to the funeral?
- I did go, yes.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.528
Why didn't I go with you?

25:30.155 --> 25:32.490
I think I told you about it,
but you were busy or something.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.583
You should tell him to come round again.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.918
I will. He'll be great company for Bob.

25:44.294 --> 25:47.088
I thought next time I could take both
of them out somewhere, for a bike ride.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.258
You should get that.
It could be the hospital.

25:56.598 --> 25:59.684
- Hello?
<i>- Hello. How are you?</i>

26:01.936 --> 26:05.106
I'm fine, Martin. Is something wrong?

26:05.899 --> 26:08.193
<i>No, I just called to tell you I had...</i>

26:08.276 --> 26:09.944
<i>a wonderful time today.</i>

26:10.945 --> 26:12.280
I'm very pleased to hear that.

26:13.031 --> 26:16.576
<i>Yes. I thought I should return the favor.</i>

26:16.660 --> 26:20.705
<i>So I'd like to invite you to dinner,
at my house.</i>

26:21.081 --> 26:25.168
<i>My mom will be delighted to see you.
She hasn't seen you in two years.</i>

26:25.877 --> 26:29.464
<i>Not since the hospital. She'll make meatloaf.</i>

26:30.632 --> 26:32.175
That's very kind of you.

26:32.967 --> 26:34.052
We'll do that someday.

26:34.469 --> 26:36.763
<i>Tomorrow night. I told her already.</i>

26:37.263 --> 26:39.265
<i>I've asked her to make meatloaf and lemonade.</i>

26:40.266 --> 26:43.937
<i>I'll be home by 6:30. Around 7:3Ø?</i>

27:17.387 --> 27:19.013
Did you come by the hospital today?

27:19.347 --> 27:23.685
No. I was in school.
And then I went to the gym.

27:24.352 --> 27:25.979
Weren't you down at the hospital today?

27:26.438 --> 27:29.107
I was, but I was really busy.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.401
I just wondered whether you came by
and couldn't find me.

27:35.071 --> 27:37.282
I thought we could all
watch a movie together.

27:38.575 --> 27:39.492
If you don't mind.

27:40.410 --> 27:41.745
I'd like to watch a movie.

27:42.328 --> 27:46.082
I'm sorry, I have to be getting home soon.
I can't be out too late.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.544
I didn't tell my wife I'd be late tonight
and she might get worried.

27:50.587 --> 27:51.671
You could call her.

27:52.547 --> 27:55.175
Anyway, if you feel tired,
you could stop the movie.

27:55.258 --> 27:58.094
You could go home and we could watch
the rest next time you come.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.806
Please, it's my favorite movie.
It's also my father's favorite movie, too.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.852
<i>Special today is blueberry waffles.</i>

28:06.644 --> 28:08.980
<i>- Why are you telling me this?</i>
<i>- Because I want you</i>

28:09.063 --> 28:10.064
<i>to believe in me.</i>

28:10.774 --> 28:13.401
<i>You're not a god.
You can take my word for it.</i>

28:13.485 --> 28:15.320
<i>This is 12 years of Catholic school talking.</i>

28:16.070 --> 28:17.822
<i>I could come back if you're not ready.</i>

28:18.281 --> 28:20.825
<i>How do you know I'm not a god?</i>

28:20.909 --> 28:22.535
I think I'll go to bed.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.915
I'm sorry I can't watch the rest
of the movie with you.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.880
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Martin.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.761
<i>...groundhog, who, as legend has it,
can predict the coming of an early spring.</i>

28:40.970 --> 28:43.389
<i>So I guess the question we have
to ask ourselves today is...</i>

28:44.557 --> 28:45.975
Have you been married long?

28:47.352 --> 28:48.353
16 years.

28:57.195 --> 29:00.114
- You have lovely hands.
- Thank you.

29:01.157 --> 29:07.080
Most doctors have beautiful hands.
So white and soft and clean.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.040
- Really?
- Yes.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.129
I remember your hands from back
when I used to visit my husband

29:15.213 --> 29:16.297
at the hospital.

29:17.715 --> 29:20.051
In fact, I even told him about your hands.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.095
And he agreed.

29:23.096 --> 29:26.432
"You're right," he said.
"He has beautiful hands."

29:28.601 --> 29:29.769
Thank you very much.

29:31.938 --> 29:33.606
Do you remember me coming to the hospital?

29:34.691 --> 29:35.608
Of course.

29:37.235 --> 29:39.821
I was a little heavier then
and my hair was brown.

29:40.905 --> 29:41.823
Yes.

29:43.741 --> 29:47.203
I got tired of it.
I dyed it about a month ago.

29:48.997 --> 29:52.041
Did you prefer me with brown hair?
Like it was back then?

29:54.168 --> 29:56.170
I think it's... nicer now.

29:56.921 --> 29:58.089
Yes, I agree.

30:09.517 --> 30:12.145
Would you like some dessert?
I made a caramel tart.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.606
No, thank you.

30:14.939 --> 30:18.693
Maybe later then. You did have a lot to eat.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.247
Can I take a closer look at your hands?

30:52.268 --> 30:55.688
Don't worry, he's definitely asleep.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

30:56.147 --> 30:58.483
In any case, he wants this as much as I do.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.611
- I have to go.
- I'm sorry if I made you feel awkward.

31:01.694 --> 31:02.904
I didn't mean to.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.324
But I won't let you leave
until you've tried my tart.

31:06.991 --> 31:09.285
Please, I'll get you a piece now.
Please, sit down.

31:09.369 --> 31:12.080
I'm sorry, I really have to go. Goodnight.

31:34.435 --> 31:35.561
Good morning.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.980
What are you doing here?
Why aren't you in school?

31:38.064 --> 31:40.775
- My heart aches.
- What do you mean?

31:42.735 --> 31:45.738
I'm in pain. My chest, it hurts.

31:46.447 --> 31:50.326
- My heart. I'm worried.
- There's no need for you to be worried.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.957
I'm worried because it's hereditary.

31:56.624 --> 31:59.669
- You're too young to be worried.
- That's what you said about my father.

32:00.670 --> 32:04.549
He didn't smoke. He ate a very healthy diet.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.136
He went swimming almost every day.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.265
He should have come out of that surgery
alive but he died.

32:15.226 --> 32:18.646
I smoke. I started smoking recently.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.443
It hurts here.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.119
I hardly slept at all last night.

32:34.745 --> 32:37.331
My mom was so worried, I slept in her bed.

32:55.224 --> 32:58.811
If I had hair on my chest and belly,
how would you attach these?

32:59.812 --> 33:01.022
We'd shave the hair off first.

33:02.231 --> 33:04.317
How long does it take for the hair
to grow back?

33:04.901 --> 33:05.818
I don't know.

33:07.111 --> 33:08.779
About a month, I suppose.

33:11.449 --> 33:14.368
Your son told me that you've got
lots of hair under your arms.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.245
Three times more than I do.

33:16.871 --> 33:20.208
And that you've got a very hairy back
and a very hairy belly.

33:21.375 --> 33:24.003
I probably do have a little more hair
than you do because I'm older than you.

33:25.254 --> 33:28.591
But soon you'll have more hair, too.
It's all down to hormones.

33:29.842 --> 33:31.010
Can you show me, please?

33:32.386 --> 33:35.431
Can you take off your shirt
and show me, please?

33:37.767 --> 33:38.684
Please.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.461
Okay, you do have more hair than I do
but not three times more.

34:06.045 --> 34:08.839
Me and my mom thought it would be nice
if you came by for dinner tonight.

34:10.049 --> 34:11.717
We could watch the rest of the movie.

34:13.261 --> 34:14.679
Does eight sound good for you?

34:15.554 --> 34:17.764
That's very kind of you
but I just can't make it tonight.

34:19.308 --> 34:20.226
I need to be at home.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.980
- Can't you get away for a couple of hours?
- I can't. No.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.148
Some other time.

34:27.108 --> 34:28.484
My mom's gonna be upset.

34:29.318 --> 34:32.196
Can I tell you a secret?
But don't tell her I told you.

34:33.531 --> 34:37.784
I think she... I think she likes you.
I mean, she's attracted to you.

34:38.369 --> 34:41.289
But she says that's not true.
But it is, I'm sure.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.875
And, to be honest, I think you're perfect
for each other.

34:46.502 --> 34:47.753
You'd make a great couple.

34:49.170 --> 34:52.466
She's got a great body.
You've seen it for yourself.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.473
She lost weight
and she has a really great figure.

35:04.520 --> 35:05.938
Your mother is very beautiful, but the idea

35:06.022 --> 35:08.107
that she and I could ever be together
is ludicrous.

35:09.108 --> 35:10.985
Let me remind you, I'm a married man.

35:11.944 --> 35:15.489
And I love my wife very much and my kids,
and that we are very happy together.

35:16.616 --> 35:18.993
And for your information,
you're absolutely fine.

35:19.076 --> 35:19.994
There's nothing wrong with you.

35:20.703 --> 35:23.581
But you really should stop smoking.
Do you promise?

35:25.291 --> 35:28.210
So we're okay?
There is nothing wrong with me?

35:29.420 --> 35:30.463
You couldn't be healthier.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.799
You should really go now
because I'm late for my rounds.

35:41.724 --> 35:46.270
Don't use that knife. Here.
Use this one. It's much sharper.

35:47.355 --> 35:49.482
- There you go, Doctor.
- Thank you, Nurse.

35:52.193 --> 35:55.237
Oh, and don't forget to slice off
the cheeks. They're delicious.

35:55.571 --> 35:56.614
I can do that.

36:02.912 --> 36:04.080
<i>Where are you?</i>

36:05.998 --> 36:08.542
<i>I called you a hundred times.
Didn't you see my calls?</i>

36:10.378 --> 36:11.587
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

36:14.131 --> 36:17.510
<i>What do you mean you can't?
I got you a slice of apple pie.</i>

36:20.137 --> 36:24.100
No, no, you have to.
I've been waiting for over half an hour.

36:28.521 --> 36:32.692
Just come for a little while.
I can come closer to where you are.

36:33.567 --> 36:34.777
Are you at the hospital?

36:36.612 --> 36:38.322
I can bring you the apple pie.

36:40.282 --> 36:42.368
What's... what's so important?

36:44.245 --> 36:47.998
Is it a... is it an operation?
Are you at the hospital?

36:51.877 --> 36:53.713
I love the sound of those cooking.

37:04.849 --> 37:09.645
- Where were you?
- I was inside. Making a call.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.982
The fish is almost ready. Pass me your plate.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.569
I'll get them.
I need to wash my hands anyway.

37:17.361 --> 37:18.696
Thank you, my dear.

37:26.704 --> 37:29.206
- Do you need a hand?
- No, that's okay.

37:31.876 --> 37:34.253
I forgot to tell you
I saw that boy yesterday.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.297
Your daughter's school mate.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.132
Martin?

37:38.799 --> 37:42.261
Yes, right, Martin.
Couldn't remember his name.

37:43.721 --> 37:45.765
- Where did you see him?
- At the hospital.

37:46.390 --> 37:49.018
He was hanging around your car.
Looked like he was waiting for you.

37:49.977 --> 37:52.521
I tried to say hello
but he pretended not to see me.

37:52.855 --> 37:56.192
That's impossible. Can't have been him.

37:56.692 --> 37:59.111
I could be wrong,
but it looked a lot like him.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.158
Take my piece off the grill, will you?
I don't like it overdone.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.509
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.011
- Where have you been?
- Choir practice.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.806
- Have you eaten?
- Yes, I ate earlier.

38:27.306 --> 38:30.267
You don't have to take the dog for a walk.
I took her out already.

38:30.351 --> 38:32.228
- I got back a little while ago.
- Okay.

38:33.312 --> 38:34.855
Dad, do you know who I saw today?

38:35.397 --> 38:36.482
- Who, darling?
- Martin.

38:36.899 --> 38:37.817
Martin who?

38:38.067 --> 38:40.736
Martin, that boy who came over here
the other day.

38:41.237 --> 38:42.696
The son of your ex-patient.

38:43.364 --> 38:46.283
He brought me back from choir practice
on his friend's motorcycle.

38:46.784 --> 38:49.578
He's really funny.
I laughed so hard my ribs hurt.

38:51.163 --> 38:52.540
Yes, he is very funny.

38:54.333 --> 38:56.752
Kim, I don't want you riding
on motorcycles without a helmet.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.421
I was wearing a helmet. He gave me his.

38:59.839 --> 39:03.092
- Why didn't you ask him to come in?
- I did but he was in a hurry.

39:03.425 --> 39:04.552
He had to get home.

39:04.969 --> 39:06.720
- Where's Mom?
- She's taking a shower.

39:07.263 --> 39:08.389
Is there something you need?

39:09.974 --> 39:11.058
I'm going up to bed.

39:12.101 --> 39:13.102
Good night, darling.

40:08.157 --> 40:10.242
- Did you wake Bob?
- I did.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.579
He just likes lying in bed
before getting up. Leave him be.

40:14.371 --> 40:16.332
You want me to squeeze you
some more orange juice?

40:16.916 --> 40:18.542
He'll be late. Have you seen the time?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.211
School bus will be here any minute.

40:29.553 --> 40:32.348
Robert, do you have any idea
what time it is? Get up and get dressed.

40:35.309 --> 40:36.310
I can't get up.

40:36.769 --> 40:39.229
You have ten minutes to get washed,
dressed, and eat your breakfast.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.274
I'm not going to drive you to school,
and neither is your mother.

40:44.026 --> 40:45.027
I can't get up.

40:46.028 --> 40:48.113
Bob, get up and get dressed,
and stop messing around.

40:49.448 --> 40:53.118
Dad, my legs, they're numb.

40:54.828 --> 40:55.996
I can't move them.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.667
I can't stand up.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.078
<i>Do you know where you are right now?</i>

41:36.745 --> 41:39.415
I'm at the hospital,
in the neurology department.

41:39.957 --> 41:43.836
You are absolutely right.
Can you tell me what day it is today?

41:44.378 --> 41:46.338
- Thursday.
- Right again.

41:46.630 --> 41:48.549
Now, I'm going to take this pin,

41:49.133 --> 41:52.219
I'm going to touch the soles
of your feet and your toes

41:52.720 --> 41:55.139
and I want you to tell me...

41:56.265 --> 41:58.434
- Can you feel this?
- Yeah.

42:02.396 --> 42:03.897
Mm-hm. Yes.

42:04.314 --> 42:07.860
For this one, you're gonna sit up
and look right at me. Okay?

42:20.330 --> 42:22.166
Good. Now stick out your tongue...

42:37.598 --> 42:39.767
- What happened?
- Everything's absolutely fine.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.811
Larry gave him a thorough
neurological exam. It's nothing.

42:43.604 --> 42:45.564
You two go home. And we'll talk tonight.

42:46.190 --> 42:49.068
I won't be late.
My schedule today is pretty light. Okay?

42:49.943 --> 42:51.653
Maybe he should get an MRI.

42:52.279 --> 42:55.866
There's no need to bother with all that.
He just got scared, that's all.

42:57.409 --> 42:59.411
He's absolutely fine.
You're absolutely fine, aren't you?

42:59.495 --> 43:00.412
Yeah.

43:01.789 --> 43:03.248
I think maybe there was a test
at school today

43:03.332 --> 43:04.792
that we hadn't prepared for very well.

43:05.167 --> 43:08.003
Yes, he wanted to spend the day
at the hospital with Larry and us.

43:08.712 --> 43:09.630
Let's go.

43:10.172 --> 43:11.090
- Dad.
- Yeah?

43:11.381 --> 43:13.258
Aren't you going to show us
an operating theater?

43:13.342 --> 43:14.343
Another time, darling.

43:14.551 --> 43:16.095
They need me to prep for surgery right away.

43:16.178 --> 43:17.554
I have to go. I'll see you tonight.

43:48.669 --> 43:50.337
I can't feel my legs.

43:52.214 --> 43:53.674
- What?
- I can't feel my legs!

43:58.345 --> 43:59.596
Come on, roll over.

44:01.390 --> 44:03.267
Excuse me, can we get some help here?

44:04.935 --> 44:06.436
He needs some help. Thank you.

44:37.926 --> 44:42.222
<i>MRI, MRA both fine.
Blood work came back good.</i>

44:43.223 --> 44:45.767
<i>Cardiogram, chest X-ray, all clear.</i>

44:46.185 --> 44:49.479
<i>Has he been
under any psychological stress lately?</i>

44:49.938 --> 44:51.356
<i>Exams at school maybe?</i>

44:51.440 --> 44:54.109
- Yes.
- He's not stressed. He's fine.

44:54.568 --> 44:56.820
He's a little anxious
but that's just the way he is.

44:58.238 --> 45:01.533
In my opinion,
he should stay in tomorrow, as well,

45:01.617 --> 45:03.285
just so we can keep an eye on him.

45:03.702 --> 45:04.870
What about a PET scan?

45:05.162 --> 45:08.290
I don't think there's any need for that.
What do you think, Larry?

45:09.208 --> 45:11.168
And tomorrow he'll be well enough
to walk all the way home.

45:11.543 --> 45:13.670
Yes, I don't think
it's necessary at this point.

45:14.171 --> 45:18.050
Let's see how things go tomorrow
and we'll take it from there.

45:18.884 --> 45:20.886
There's nothing to worry about,
in my opinion.

45:21.470 --> 45:25.265
You go home, we'll speak tomorrow,
and I'll be here all day.

45:26.391 --> 45:29.102
And, Anna, great seeing you...

45:30.479 --> 45:31.772
even under these circumstances.

45:32.231 --> 45:34.274
- You, too, Larry.
- Good night.

45:34.775 --> 45:36.818
Goodbye, Larry. And thanks for everything.

45:37.819 --> 45:40.489
Do you want me to let them know
you won't be operating tomorrow?

45:40.572 --> 45:43.033
I said no. Stop going on about it.

45:43.367 --> 45:44.952
That won't be necessary, Matthew.

45:45.452 --> 45:47.412
I'll come by in the morning.
I won't go into the clinic.

45:47.496 --> 45:49.331
I'll bring in those doughnuts
he loves so much.

45:49.414 --> 45:51.750
Yes. I'm sure he'll be thrilled.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.348
- Where were you?
- At Claire's.

46:50.767 --> 46:52.853
- Is Dad asleep?
- Yes.

46:55.439 --> 46:58.567
- How's Bob?
- Bob is absolutely fine.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.402
They're just keeping him in as a precaution.

47:03.071 --> 47:06.450
- How are you feeling?
- I'm fine. How do you mean?

47:07.284 --> 47:10.495
- I mean, are you tired?
- I'm absolutely fine.

47:12.622 --> 47:14.708
- I'm a little tired, that's all.
- Okay.

47:18.128 --> 47:19.129
See you in the morning.

47:20.005 --> 47:22.632
Oh, and while Bob's in the hospital
you'll be responsible

47:22.716 --> 47:24.301
for watering the plants. Okay?

47:37.147 --> 47:39.358
Did he go to the bathroom? Did he get up?

47:39.441 --> 47:41.985
He hadn't when I passed by
about an hour ago. He didn't want to.

47:42.069 --> 47:43.737
He didn't want to pee or hadn't gotten up?

47:43.820 --> 47:46.031
- He didn't want to pee.
- Could he get up?

47:46.114 --> 47:47.949
He was asleep.
I didn't want to drag him out of bed.

47:53.330 --> 47:56.083
Good morning, Doctor.
How are you, Mrs. Murphy?

47:57.125 --> 48:00.170
I came by to see Bob.
Kim told me what happened.

48:01.213 --> 48:03.215
Hi, Martin. How nice of you.

48:04.341 --> 48:05.717
Good morning, darling.

48:06.843 --> 48:08.720
Did your friend Martin come to see you?

48:09.388 --> 48:12.307
I'll leave you alone now so you can spend
some time with him, too.

48:12.808 --> 48:13.850
I gotta go anyway.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.520
I'll come by and see him
again some other time.

48:17.270 --> 48:22.025
I offered to help him go to the bathroom
but he didn't want me to.

48:23.360 --> 48:24.569
He wet the bed.

48:27.531 --> 48:29.741
I brought some lemonade
my mom made yesterday.

48:30.492 --> 48:32.744
You should try some.
Let me know what you think.

48:32.828 --> 48:34.037
Thank you very much.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.332
Darling, do you know what's in this box?

48:38.625 --> 48:40.627
- What?
- Cinnamon doughnuts.

48:40.710 --> 48:42.796
Let's go to the cafeteria upstairs.

48:44.464 --> 48:45.674
Come whenever you can.

48:46.675 --> 48:48.802
I don't think I'll have time
today, as you might imagine.

48:49.261 --> 48:50.220
We'll talk some other time.

48:50.846 --> 48:54.975
No, today. To the cafeteria.
Just for ten minutes.

48:55.058 --> 48:56.560
Don't stand me up like last night.

49:04.860 --> 49:06.445
I brought you a present.

49:07.195 --> 49:10.699
You've given me so many presents
and I've not given you anything.

49:11.366 --> 49:12.617
I thought that was rude of me.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.620
Close your eyes.

49:17.372 --> 49:18.665
Close your eyes, please.

49:20.876 --> 49:22.294
It's a Swiss Army knife.

49:22.502 --> 49:26.047
I shouldn't have told you that.
I've just ruined the surprise. I'm sorry.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.551
- Thank you very much, Martin.
- I was dumb.

49:29.801 --> 49:31.470
Martin, I have to get back downstairs.

49:33.263 --> 49:34.181
Okay.

49:35.599 --> 49:39.186
I won't keep you much longer even though
you... you have been devoting,

49:39.269 --> 49:41.021
less and less time to me lately.

49:43.106 --> 49:45.775
I wanted to say one more thing.
I'm really sorry about Bob.

49:46.109 --> 49:47.694
- It's nothing serious.
- No, it is.

49:47.986 --> 49:50.238
That critical moment we both knew
would come someday...

49:51.490 --> 49:53.533
Here it is. That time is now.

49:56.745 --> 49:59.581
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

50:00.707 --> 50:02.918
Listen, Martin, I don't have time for this.

50:03.752 --> 50:07.255
Okay, I'm gonna explain this very quickly
so that I don't hold you up.

50:09.841 --> 50:11.760
Yes, it's exactly what you think.

50:11.843 --> 50:14.554
Just as you killed a member of my family,
now you gotta kill a member of your family

50:14.638 --> 50:16.348
to balance things out, understand?

50:16.431 --> 50:18.725
I can't tell you who to kill,
of course, that's for you to decide.

50:18.808 --> 50:21.686
But, if you don't do it,
they will all get sick and die.

50:21.770 --> 50:24.439
Bob will die. Kim will die.
Your wife will die.

50:24.523 --> 50:27.609
They will all get sick and die.
One: paralysis of the limbs.

50:27.692 --> 50:29.903
Two: refusal of food
to the point of starvation.

50:29.986 --> 50:33.323
Three: bleeding from the eyes.
Four: death. One, two, three, four.

50:33.406 --> 50:36.076
Don't worry, you won't get sick.
You've just gotta stay calm, that's all.

50:38.537 --> 50:41.081
There, I said it as quickly as I could.

50:42.457 --> 50:44.376
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

50:47.212 --> 50:49.089
Uh, one more thing.

50:50.173 --> 50:51.341
I'll be very quick.

50:51.591 --> 50:54.844
You only have a few days to decide
who to kill. Once stage three kicks in,

50:55.470 --> 50:58.223
you remember what stage three is?

50:58.932 --> 51:02.435
It's bleeding from the eyes,
that's stage three.

51:03.353 --> 51:06.106
Once the bleeding happens, it's only
a matter of hours before they die.

51:08.066 --> 51:10.443
Okay, there. I have nothing more to say.

51:10.527 --> 51:14.030
Unless you've... Unless you've any questions.

51:43.810 --> 51:47.188
- Has he eaten?
- No. He's not hungry.

51:48.815 --> 51:52.319
- What do you mean he's not hungry?
- He's not hungry.

52:07.083 --> 52:09.044
Come on, darling. Eat a doughnut.

52:09.878 --> 52:11.713
- I don't want it, Dad.
- You do.

52:12.881 --> 52:14.883
But you're afraid your mother
and I'll tell you off

52:14.966 --> 52:18.803
for eating doughnuts. Come on, eat it.
You have my permission.

52:19.512 --> 52:20.680
You have our permission.

52:20.764 --> 52:22.474
It's okay for him to eat a doughnut,
isn't it Anna?

52:22.557 --> 52:24.934
- Yes, of course.
- You heard your mother, eat it.

52:26.561 --> 52:27.479
Bob?

52:32.233 --> 52:34.944
Leave him alone. He doesn't want it.
He'll eat it later.

52:35.028 --> 52:36.029
That's right.

52:37.906 --> 52:40.450
That's right. Eat it. Now chew it. Swallow.

52:40.742 --> 52:44.371
- Leave him alone. He doesn't want it now.
- He's going to eat them right now.

52:44.454 --> 52:45.622
He is completely run down.

52:45.705 --> 52:47.999
That's why he keeps falling over
and crawling around on all fours.

52:49.584 --> 52:50.710
He's going to eat them, all of them.

52:50.794 --> 52:52.587
Five minutes flat,
I want to see that whole box empty.

53:26.705 --> 53:31.710
That means,
"On the bus there are winners and losers."

53:33.044 --> 53:37.340
But it's funny because it sounds like,

53:37.841 --> 53:41.886
"On the bus there are 20 hearts
and 20 asses."

53:41.970 --> 53:43.805
That is funny.

53:50.478 --> 53:52.230
Are you on your period?

53:53.606 --> 53:54.524
No.

53:57.652 --> 53:59.696
If you're hungry,
we can order something later.

54:00.655 --> 54:03.491
My parents won't be back till late
and they've left me some money.

54:05.535 --> 54:06.661
I'm not hungry.

54:42.405 --> 54:44.407
You're the prettiest girl I've ever met.

54:55.877 --> 54:57.504
I have to go, I'm sorry.

54:58.588 --> 54:59.631
Why?

55:00.340 --> 55:03.259
Stay a little longer.
We can listen to some music.

55:03.968 --> 55:06.012
I can't. It's late. I'm sorry.

55:10.475 --> 55:12.227
Are you mad at me because of my dad?

55:12.310 --> 55:14.729
Don't be stupid. I'm not mad at you at all.

55:15.522 --> 55:16.981
I thought I made myself clear.

55:18.775 --> 55:21.319
I don't feel angry at him.
I feel sorry for him.

55:22.904 --> 55:26.783
I have to go because it's late.
It's as simple as that.

55:27.909 --> 55:29.994
Don't be a drag. I thought you understood.

55:30.703 --> 55:33.498
I'm sorry, Martin. I love you so much.

56:15.790 --> 56:17.208
He stopped eating today.

56:18.501 --> 56:19.752
He refuses to eat.

56:22.213 --> 56:23.756
Some of the tests need to be done again.

56:24.299 --> 56:27.552
Take a deep breath.
Hold it for a few seconds.

56:27.635 --> 56:30.430
- They haven't detected anything.
- Okay, good. Breathe.

56:31.431 --> 56:33.308
It's been less than a day
since his last tests

56:33.391 --> 56:35.810
I don't think the results are gonna show
anything different.

56:36.519 --> 56:38.396
To be honest, I think what we have here

56:39.314 --> 56:42.233
<i>is a clear case
of some psychosomatic disorder.</i>

56:43.109 --> 56:44.861
<i>I'm inclined to agree with Anna.</i>

56:46.654 --> 56:47.655
<i>Well, what do you mean?</i>

56:47.989 --> 56:50.950
Shouldn't we rule out all possible causes
before we resort to the easy option

56:51.034 --> 56:52.410
of a psychosomatic disorder?

56:53.202 --> 56:55.079
We already have ruled out everything else.

56:59.375 --> 57:02.420
<i>I think with psychological
support and psychiatric treatment,</i>

57:02.503 --> 57:04.672
<i>if necessary, he will be just fine.</i>

57:05.298 --> 57:07.800
He'll walk again and he'll eat again.

57:08.593 --> 57:09.594
Of course he will.

57:15.183 --> 57:18.978
Anna, if Bob was near-sighted
and had a cataract or glaucoma

57:19.062 --> 57:20.521
then your opinion really would be valuable.

57:21.940 --> 57:23.691
But, thankfully, Bob's eyesight is perfect.

57:24.651 --> 57:26.486
And I can honestly say
that if he ever needed glasses

57:26.569 --> 57:28.029
you'd be the first person, I'd consult.

57:28.780 --> 57:31.032
But right now the boy can't eat
and he's paralyzed in both legs.

57:31.115 --> 57:33.952
So I'm sorry, I'm not remotely interested
in your medical opinion.

57:35.745 --> 57:37.997
<i>Doors opening. Take your turn.</i>

57:44.128 --> 57:45.296
<i>Doors closing.</i>

57:45.880 --> 57:47.966
<i>Please stand clear.</i>

58:09.028 --> 58:10.947
Come on, Bob. Let's go for a walk.

58:11.698 --> 58:13.616
Up you get. There you go.

58:14.033 --> 58:14.951
Okay.

58:15.284 --> 58:18.121
Ready? There we go.

58:38.474 --> 58:39.392
Bob?

58:45.189 --> 58:47.608
- Why don't we play a game?
- What game?

58:47.692 --> 58:49.902
I'll tell you a secret,
something I've never told you before.

58:50.319 --> 58:53.781
Then you'll tell me one and whoever
tells the best secret wins. Okay?

58:56.909 --> 59:00.329
When I was your age,
I'd only just started masturbating.

59:01.831 --> 59:05.585
And I'd only just started ejaculating.
Only a little, barely a drop.

59:06.753 --> 59:08.421
I was worried that I had some kind of problem

59:08.504 --> 59:10.923
because at school I'd heard
all sorts of stories.

59:13.551 --> 59:16.095
Then one day, when my father had had
a lot to drink,

59:17.055 --> 59:19.474
and my brothers were out
and he was sleeping in the bedroom,

59:20.475 --> 59:22.977
I crept inside, put my hand on his penis,

59:23.728 --> 59:25.438
and started stroking it until he ejaculated.

59:27.482 --> 59:28.649
The sheets were covered in sperm.

59:30.568 --> 59:31.611
I got scared and ran out.

59:34.530 --> 59:35.740
I've never told anyone that before.

59:37.950 --> 59:39.786
Now, it's your turn to tell me a secret.

59:41.704 --> 59:44.624
I don't know. I don't have one.

59:45.625 --> 59:48.002
That's impossible. You have to have one.

59:50.463 --> 59:52.423
No. I don't.

59:53.466 --> 59:56.135
Bob, if all this is just an act,
you should know that if you tell me now,

59:56.219 --> 59:58.096
I won't punish you.
And neither will your mother.

59:59.055 --> 01:00:00.515
We won't be angry with you, either.

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:03.434
It's not an act.

01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:06.813
But if it is an act and you don't stop
this stupid joke right now,

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:09.107
your punishment won't just be
no TV for two months.

01:00:10.233 --> 01:00:13.528
I will take my electric razor,
and I will shave your head

01:00:14.237 --> 01:00:15.154
and make you eat your hair.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:21.702
I mean it, I will literally make you eat
your hair. I'm not kidding.

01:00:23.079 --> 01:00:24.080
It's not an act.

01:00:41.806 --> 01:00:45.059
- I brought you a clean shirt.
- Thank you.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.355
Anything to tell me?

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:53.609
Hungry?

01:00:55.194 --> 01:00:56.696
Want me to bring you something to eat?

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.157
No, thank you.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.579
Maybe you were right.
Maybe it's all psychological.

01:01:05.746 --> 01:01:08.875
Everything will be all right, you'll see.
Trust me.

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:12.503
We're in this together.
It's all gonna be fine.

01:01:14.839 --> 01:01:15.882
Let's get you something to eat,

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:17.800
get some fresh air, and go up
and see the little one.

01:01:18.718 --> 01:01:21.637
<i># Christmas is here, bringing good cheer #
# To young and old #</i>

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:23.598
<i># Meek and the bold #
# Ding, dong, ding, dong #</i>

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:26.642
<i># That is their song #
# With joyful ring, all caroling #</i>

01:01:26.726 --> 01:01:30.855
<i># One seems to hear words of good cheer #
# From everywhere, filling the air #</i>

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:32.940
<i># Oh! How they pound #
# Raising their sound #</i>

01:01:33.024 --> 01:01:35.026
<i>#O'er hill and dale #
# Telling their tale #</i>

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:39.071
<i># Gaily they ring, while people sing #
# Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here #</i>

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:41.115
<i># Sing Merry, merry, merry Christmas #</i>

01:01:41.199 --> 01:01:43.034
<i># Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas #</i>

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:47.121
<i># On, on they send, on without end #
# Their joyful tone to every home #</i>

01:01:47.205 --> 01:01:49.081
<i># Hark! How the bells #
# Sweet silver bells #</i>

01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:51.042
<i># All seem to say, throw cares away #</i>

01:01:51.125 --> 01:01:52.960
<i># Christmas is here, bringing good cheer #</i>

01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:54.879
<i># To young and old, meek and the bold #</i>

01:01:55.129 --> 01:01:57.048
<i># Ding, dong, ding, dong #
# That is their song #</i>

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:59.091
<i># With joyful ring, all caroling #</i>

01:01:59.175 --> 01:02:03.304
<i># One seems to hear words of good cheer #
# From everywhere, filling the air #</i>

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.348
<i># Oh! How they pound #
# Raising their sound #</i>

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:07.433
<i>#O'er hill and dale, telling their tale #</i>

01:02:07.516 --> 01:02:11.312
<i># Gaily they ring, while people sing #
# Songs of good cheer, Christmas is... #</i>

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.307
Dad, I don't want any fruit.

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:52.645
Just one bite...

01:02:54.689 --> 01:02:55.648
for me.

01:03:18.713 --> 01:03:19.714
I can't.

01:03:20.756 --> 01:03:21.757
Okay.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:17.104
Open the door!

01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.865
I know you're in there!

01:04:30.493 --> 01:04:32.620
Open the door or I will smash it down!

01:04:34.288 --> 01:04:35.331
Martin!

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:39.293
Open the door or I will smash it down,

01:04:39.376 --> 01:04:42.213
and I will fuck you and your mother
just the way you wanted!

01:04:49.011 --> 01:04:52.473
If anything happens to my kids
or my wife, you'll die in prison.

01:04:53.432 --> 01:04:56.393
You know that... you'll die in prison!

01:05:09.031 --> 01:05:10.908
<i>How old was his father when he died?</i>

01:05:11.659 --> 01:05:12.660
<i>46.</i>

01:05:13.369 --> 01:05:14.912
<i>Had you been drinking that day?</i>

01:05:15.287 --> 01:05:17.289
<i>He had an arrhythmia, a stroke,
and that was it.</i>

01:05:17.373 --> 01:05:19.917
I asked whether you'd been drinking,
not how he died.

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:24.964
How long has this been going on?
How long have you been seeing this boy?

01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:27.174
About six months.

01:05:30.219 --> 01:05:31.929
- Where were you meeting?
- What does it matter?

01:05:32.388 --> 01:05:33.639
Where were you meeting him?

01:05:33.722 --> 01:05:35.933
At a diner and then we'd drive down
to the river.

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:38.519
He's got issues,
serious psychological issues.

01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:39.520
He always did.

01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:42.982
I knew he acted weird sometimes
but now he's lost it completely.

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:43.983
He's become dangerous.

01:05:44.817 --> 01:05:45.985
We have to take precautions.

01:05:46.902 --> 01:05:48.863
Go to the police and take some
precautionary measures.

01:05:49.989 --> 01:05:52.700
We're not going to the police.
We're not telling anyone about this.

01:05:52.783 --> 01:05:53.701
What's the point?

01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:59.248
Had you been drinking when you operated
on his father?

01:05:59.665 --> 01:06:02.209
Only a little. That had nothing to do
with the outcome.

01:06:02.751 --> 01:06:04.044
A surgeon never kills a patient.

01:06:04.295 --> 01:06:06.714
An anesthesiologist can kill a patient
but a surgeon never can.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.383
For example, Matthew has made
mistakes that have led

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.343
to the death of a patient, but I never have.

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:18.392
Bob seemed a little better today.

01:06:19.894 --> 01:06:22.146
He was in a better mood and he was less pale.

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:26.775
Why didn't you tell me you were seeing him?

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.362
At first I didn't see him that often.

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:33.199
It was only recently
that we began meeting more regularly.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.871
And I was going to tell you at some point.
I felt sorry for him.

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:41.248
I gave him some money.

01:06:43.167 --> 01:06:44.293
His mum's out of work.

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:10.694
Mom, when are we going home?

01:07:11.195 --> 01:07:13.656
Tomorrow, or the day after,
when all of the tests are done

01:07:13.739 --> 01:07:15.074
and the doctors say so.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.701
But you're doctors, too.

01:07:19.787 --> 01:07:21.246
Tell them we can go home.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:23.457
We'll tell them, darling.

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:26.919
Mom, did Martin come by while I was sleeping?

01:07:27.878 --> 01:07:28.796
No.

01:07:30.297 --> 01:07:31.924
Can you turn me on my side, please?

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:50.401
Is Dad here?

01:07:51.068 --> 01:07:52.361
No, he'll be here soon.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:55.447
Want me to get some juice for you?

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.909
No. Don't go anywhere. Stay here.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:10.754
Good morning.

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:13.507
How are you?

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:16.176
Aren't you coming by?

01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.138
Okay.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.975
Just my mom. My father will be here soon.

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:25.519
Okay.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.604
You're here?

01:08:30.232 --> 01:08:32.067
I can't. Are you coming up to see me?

01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:37.322
You really think that's possible?

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:52.421
Well, let's see. Okay. Okay.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:23.743
Yes, I stood up. Can you see me?

01:09:24.870 --> 01:09:25.953
Yes, thank you.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:31.335
Yeah, I'm standing at the window.
Can you see me?

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.046
I can't see you.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:36.924
I'm waving at you.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:52.773
Mom? I want to stand up like Kim.
How come she can get up and I can't?

01:09:53.273 --> 01:09:54.900
You'll be able to soon, my darling.

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:57.111
Kim's older than you,
that's why she can do it.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.321
Soon you'll be strong enough
to stand up, too.

01:09:59.404 --> 01:10:02.866
All right. I'm going back to bed. You, too.

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:08.163
Bye.

01:10:10.249 --> 01:10:11.792
Mom, I'm going over to the window.

01:10:17.381 --> 01:10:18.298
No!

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.898
Who were you talking to?

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.318
Martin. He sends his regards.

01:10:39.361 --> 01:10:41.405
I don't want you talking to him ever again.

01:10:42.114 --> 01:10:43.907
- Why?
- Because I said so.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:50.289
- Did you hear what I said?
- Fuck you.

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:54.126
- What did you say?
- I didn't say anything.

01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:56.461
Yes, you did. What did you say, Kim?

01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:59.339
Mom, let go, you're hurting me.
I didn't say anything.

01:11:00.424 --> 01:11:03.135
I'm not like your father.
If this is the way you want it,

01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.679
I'm confiscating your phone,
right here, right now.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:09.183
That will teach you to be rude
to your mother.

01:11:12.227 --> 01:11:14.730
- Give me my phone back.
- You can forget it.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:22.029
Don't be scared, Mom. Don't get hysterical.

01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:25.115
It's not that tragic.

01:11:26.158 --> 01:11:29.286
Sometimes your body hurts from not moving
and you can't sleep.

01:11:31.163 --> 01:11:32.080
That's all.

01:11:33.165 --> 01:11:36.835
The important thing is to make sure
that everything you need is within reach.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:38.879
That's all.

01:11:40.464 --> 01:11:41.381
You'll see.

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:44.051
You won't be able to move either.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:47.638
But you'll get used to it.

01:12:03.445 --> 01:12:04.780
<i>I really saw it happen.</i>

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:07.282
- <i>It was just a coincidence.</i>
- How can it be a coincidence?

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:08.742
How come neither of them have been able

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:10.244
to get up and walk until now?

01:12:10.327 --> 01:12:12.412
- Darling, listen to yourself.
- I saw it.

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:14.248
Okay. It just means
things are getting better.

01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:16.667
That's all it means.
That Kim is getting better.

01:12:17.167 --> 01:12:19.044
Now please go home and rest awhile, please.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:22.422
- They're not better. They're worse.
- This afternoon there'll be

01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:24.216
an emergency meeting with the Medical Board.

01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:27.469
Larry and I took the initiative to invite
two outstanding specialists

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:29.721
from the Presbyterian University Hospital
of Columbia.

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:31.848
<i>They already flew in from New York.</i>

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:34.893
<i>I'm meeting them this afternoon
to brief them about the case.</i>

01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:37.896
<i>One of them's actually a personal friend
of the director, Doctor Farrington.</i>

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:39.898
<i>You must've heard of him.
He's the best there is when it comes</i>

01:12:39.982 --> 01:12:42.317
<i>- to paralytic disorders.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:11.555
Good afternoon.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.519
Oh, thank you very much.

01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:23.191
I'd like to talk to you.
I'm not gonna take up much of your time.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:26.111
Of course, I've only got ten minutes

01:13:26.194 --> 01:13:27.946
'cause, I've gotta get to class.

01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:29.364
So, what's up?

01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:33.827
My husband told me about you and your father.

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:38.248
Oh, he did? Did he also tell you
about my mom?

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:40.751
No.

01:13:41.835 --> 01:13:45.464
Sorry, maybe I'm not the one
you should hear it from.

01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:52.846
But... ever since your husband killed
my father, he's been flirting with my mom.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:56.683
Constantly flirting.

01:14:00.854 --> 01:14:03.398
To be honest, she's got feelings
for him, too.

01:14:04.858 --> 01:14:10.614
She thinks he has very nice hands.
Truth is, he's... he has beautiful hands.

01:14:10.822 --> 01:14:13.200
All doctors have clean, nice,
beautiful hands.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:20.499
So, I told her, I said, "I've no problem
with it if you wanna go ahead."

01:14:21.666 --> 01:14:24.503
I mean, he seems like a nice guy,
a very nice guy.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.383
And I don't wanna get in the way of...

01:14:30.926 --> 01:14:33.303
of her trying to get her life back on track.

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:37.140
I'll be gone. I'll be gone in a few years.
I'll get a job.

01:14:42.145 --> 01:14:45.399
If my husband made a mistake,
if out of negligence or...

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:51.154
I don't know what... he caused
this tragic thing to happen

01:14:51.238 --> 01:14:53.907
I don't understand why I should have
to pay the price...

01:14:54.574 --> 01:14:56.618
why my children should have to pay the price.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:04.334
You know, not long after my dad died,

01:15:05.377 --> 01:15:09.256
someone told me that I eat spaghetti
the exact same way he did.

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:11.716
They said...

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:16.513
what an extraordinary impression
this fact had made on them.

01:15:18.265 --> 01:15:20.183
"Look at the boy. Look how he eats spaghetti.

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.727
Exactly the same way his father did.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:27.566
He sticks his fork in, he twirls it around
and around and around and around, around.

01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:32.154
Then he sticks it in his mouth."

01:15:36.408 --> 01:15:40.245
At that time, I thought I was the only one
who ate spaghetti that way.

01:15:40.996 --> 01:15:42.080
Me and my dad.

01:15:42.789 --> 01:15:47.127
Later, of course, I found out
that everyone eats spaghetti

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.378
the exact same way.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.423
Exact same way. Exact same way.

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:58.138
This made me very upset. Very upset.

01:15:59.598 --> 01:16:04.186
Maybe even more upset than when
they told me he was dead...

01:16:05.562 --> 01:16:06.688
my dad.

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:18.783
I don't know if what is happening is fair,
but... it's the only thing

01:16:18.867 --> 01:16:21.453
I can think of that's close to justice.

01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:31.379
Time's getting on and if I'm late
for class, I'm done for.

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.007
Have a good day.

01:16:50.440 --> 01:16:54.528
<i>So, I don't see any reason
for the children to stay in the hospital.</i>

01:16:55.737 --> 01:16:57.405
<i>You mean you think
you've done everything you can?</i>

01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:01.451
<i>Yes, Steven, I believe
we've done everything we can.</i>

01:17:02.285 --> 01:17:03.662
<i>I'm sorry, but if I was running this hospital</i>

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:05.330
<i>I'd feel like a complete failure.</i>

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:07.791
A loser. I wouldn't be able
to sleep at night.

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.881
- Goodnight, Anna.
- Goodnight, Ed.

01:17:20.554 --> 01:17:23.848
I suggest we sign the release forms
tomorrow and they can go home.

01:18:08.435 --> 01:18:11.229
Were you the anesthesiologist
for Jonathan Lang?

01:18:15.567 --> 01:18:18.737
- Oh, thank you. Do you want?
- No, thank you.

01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:21.740
Who's Jonathan Lang?

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:27.662
Male, 46 years old, patient
of Steven's, died on the operating table.

01:18:31.458 --> 01:18:35.378
Anna, there have been so many patients
over the years, so many operations.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:39.049
I don't remember him, unfortunately.
I'm sorry.

01:18:41.551 --> 01:18:44.929
Can you find me his file in the records
and show it to me, please?

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:49.434
I wanna see his medical history
and the cause of death.

01:18:50.435 --> 01:18:52.687
I don't think that's possible.
I'm sorry, Anna.

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:56.566
I can't just share files from the hospital.

01:18:59.152 --> 01:19:00.320
Why do you need it?

01:19:02.113 --> 01:19:03.156
Please.

01:19:08.286 --> 01:19:12.415
Look, I can't give you the file,
but I can tell you

01:19:12.499 --> 01:19:13.917
a couple of things about the case.

01:19:15.085 --> 01:19:20.757
I remember him now. I put him under.
But what do I get in return?

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:25.053
What you didn't get that day we came
for lunch at your house.

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:28.181
When?

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:31.559
Now.

01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:38.066
- Had Steven been drinking?
- Yes.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:41.403
- Can it be considered his mistake?
- Yes.

01:19:42.153 --> 01:19:43.822
It wasn't mine, that's for sure.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:48.993
You know an anesthesiologist is never
to blame for the bad outcome

01:19:49.077 --> 01:19:50.161
of an operation.

01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:53.581
The surgeon is always responsible.

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:59.087
He'd had two drinks that morning
before we went in to prepare.

01:20:00.171 --> 01:20:03.383
Luckily no one else realized.
I was the only one that knew.

01:20:04.217 --> 01:20:07.262
But, back then, that wasn't exactly unusual.

01:20:08.263 --> 01:20:09.347
You know that.

01:21:09.824 --> 01:21:10.825
Thank you.

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:26.758
Oh, this meat is delicious.

01:21:31.012 --> 01:21:34.808
I mean, you were right after all.
The children are much better off here.

01:21:37.435 --> 01:21:40.605
I was even thinking we might take them
to the beach house for a few days.

01:21:41.105 --> 01:21:43.608
A little fresh air and a change of scenery
might do us all good.

01:21:47.779 --> 01:21:49.864
Do you know what I've been craving?
Mashed potato.

01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:52.826
Why don't you make some tomorrow?

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:02.168
You have beautiful hands.
I never noticed before.

01:22:03.336 --> 01:22:05.880
Everyone's been telling me lately
what beautiful hands you have,

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:08.341
and now I can see for myself. Nice and clean.

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.845
But so what if they're beautiful?
They're lifeless.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.807
Sometimes, Steven,
you're just an incompetent man

01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:19.143
who goes on and on saying stupid things
like "Let's do a scan.

01:22:19.561 --> 01:22:21.604
Let's do an ultrasound.
Let's wear brown socks.

01:22:22.105 --> 01:22:24.816
Let's make mashed potatoes.
Let's go to the beach house."

01:22:25.149 --> 01:22:26.067
Excuse me?

01:22:27.986 --> 01:22:30.280
Our two children are dying
in the other room but, yes,

01:22:30.363 --> 01:22:32.282
I can make you mashed potatoes tomorrow.

01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:34.742
- Please don't talk to me that way.
- If you don't like it, why don't you

01:22:34.826 --> 01:22:37.120
go and live with Martin's mother.
I bet she'll talk to you better.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:39.831
You wanted the kids to come home,
and they came home.

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:44.210
- What else do you want me to do?
- Something to put an end to all of this,

01:22:44.294 --> 01:22:45.920
that's what I want. Can you do that?

01:22:46.713 --> 01:22:49.674
You do realize, Steven, we're
in this situation because of you?

01:22:53.136 --> 01:22:54.429
So, what do you suggest?

01:22:55.889 --> 01:22:56.890
Tell me.

01:22:58.558 --> 01:23:00.351
No, wait. I know, I've got it.

01:23:01.394 --> 01:23:03.104
There is a way we can put a stop to all this.

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:06.482
All we need to do is find the tooth
of a baby crocodile,

01:23:06.774 --> 01:23:08.902
the blood of a pigeon
and the pubes of a virgin.

01:23:08.985 --> 01:23:11.446
And then we just have to burn them all
before sunset. Let me see.

01:23:11.738 --> 01:23:13.740
Do we have any spare teeth lying around?

01:23:14.616 --> 01:23:16.868
Teeth? Pubes? No, nothing here!

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:19.704
There's nothing in here.

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:23.416
Let me see. Nothing here! Pubes? Teeth?

01:23:27.462 --> 01:23:29.047
Nothing in this box, either. Where are they?

01:23:30.048 --> 01:23:31.799
I'm sure they were here earlier.
I put them here myself.

01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:34.761
Who's been moving things around?
Unbelievable!

01:23:35.929 --> 01:23:37.847
I don't suppose you've got any pubes
I can have, by any chance?

01:23:38.765 --> 01:23:42.393
Oh, I forgot, you don't have any left.
We don't have any of the things we need.

01:23:46.856 --> 01:23:47.982
There's no need for us to argue.

01:23:49.150 --> 01:23:52.028
Everything's so difficult already.
There's no point in making it worse.

01:23:56.199 --> 01:23:58.326
If he was telling the truth,
wouldn't you be sick, too?

01:23:59.327 --> 01:24:02.705
Wouldn't you be paralyzed already?
How do you explain that?

01:24:03.915 --> 01:24:04.916
Yes, you're right.

01:24:05.291 --> 01:24:07.335
Let's wait a little longer
until we're all dead,

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:10.588
and then see what you can do about it.
There's really nothing to worry about.

01:24:19.222 --> 01:24:22.141
You need to go to the hospital tomorrow
and pick up more feeding formula

01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:24.811
- for the children. We're almost out.
- Okay.

01:25:20.533 --> 01:25:21.451
Good morning.

01:25:23.745 --> 01:25:24.662
Good morning.

01:25:25.872 --> 01:25:26.873
Did you get any sleep?

01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:31.169
What time is it?

01:25:33.546 --> 01:25:34.547
Ten past eight.

01:25:39.844 --> 01:25:41.554
Get up and come with me for a moment.

01:26:23.304 --> 01:26:24.680
You remember Martin, don't you?

01:26:25.848 --> 01:26:28.142
He came by for a play-date.
I told him the kids were feeling

01:26:28.226 --> 01:26:31.270
a little unwell, and he'll have
to stay here until they get better.

01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:37.026
Anna, go upstairs and make him
some of that lemonade he likes so much.

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:40.238
Would you? I'll stay here
and keep him company.

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:44.325
Please.

01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.589
Let me go. My mother's gonna be worried sick.

01:27:00.216 --> 01:27:01.968
Do you think
your mother's proud of you, Martin?

01:27:02.635 --> 01:27:06.472
Do you think she's happy
that her beloved son is a murderer?

01:27:07.056 --> 01:27:08.057
Murderer?

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.062
There is really no need
for such a dramatic, sensational,

01:27:13.146 --> 01:27:14.522
old-fashioned word.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:16.607
But if you insist,

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:19.777
the murderer, both in my father's case

01:27:19.861 --> 01:27:23.364
and our current situation, is not me.

01:27:23.823 --> 01:27:25.700
- Stop talking.
- Don't you understand

01:27:25.783 --> 01:27:29.453
that you're wasting time
and you don't have much time left.

01:27:29.537 --> 01:27:30.705
I said stop talking.

01:27:31.664 --> 01:27:33.749
Steven, it's gonna be better once it's done.

01:27:35.376 --> 01:27:39.213
Start over, clean slate. Don't you get it?

01:27:40.965 --> 01:27:42.341
Sometimes, I think you're naïve.

01:27:42.425 --> 01:27:45.094
But you can't be naïve.
You're a man of science.

01:27:45.511 --> 01:27:48.681
You can't be an idiot.
But, if I'd only just met you,

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.142
I would seriously question
your depth of judgment.

01:27:56.689 --> 01:27:59.358
I just want... want to show you an example.

01:27:59.442 --> 01:28:01.319
That's all.

01:28:02.862 --> 01:28:05.114
Just one little example
to show you what I mean.

01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:17.877
Should I apologize? No.

01:28:19.837 --> 01:28:21.672
Should I, should I stroke your wound?

01:28:22.298 --> 01:28:26.010
Actually, that would probably hurt
even more, touching an open wound.

01:28:26.594 --> 01:28:29.597
No, there's only one way to make
you and me both feel better.

01:28:47.531 --> 01:28:50.576
Do you understand? It's metaphorical.

01:28:52.036 --> 01:28:54.914
My example. It's a metaphor.

01:28:56.540 --> 01:29:00.836
I mean, it's... it's symbolic.

01:29:24.277 --> 01:29:25.403
Shut the door, Anna.

01:29:25.987 --> 01:29:28.281
Now, Martin, you'll know
what it's like to die.

01:29:28.906 --> 01:29:31.200
What it's like when your head cracks open
and your brains blow out.

01:29:31.284 --> 01:29:32.201
Don't shoot him.

01:29:32.285 --> 01:29:33.744
- And then?
- Shut up!

01:29:34.537 --> 01:29:36.455
Shoot me. Then what? Answer.

01:29:36.539 --> 01:29:40.167
I'll bury you in the yard. And you'll rot.
That's what.

01:29:40.418 --> 01:29:41.961
You won't be able to explain it.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:44.046
You won't understand
how it could have happened.

01:29:44.672 --> 01:29:47.091
You'll say, "But I only killed one person.

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:50.136
How come four people are dead?
I only shot one."

01:29:51.095 --> 01:29:54.473
So if you're gonna dig a hole in the yard,
better make it a big one.

01:29:54.557 --> 01:29:56.309
Steven.

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:29.216
He didn't kill him.

01:30:31.677 --> 01:30:34.096
- How do you know?
- I just do.

01:30:35.890 --> 01:30:38.601
Anyway, he made the right choice.

01:30:39.852 --> 01:30:42.897
Otherwise it would have been like
killing four people with a single shot.

01:30:44.857 --> 01:30:46.067
Wouldn't that be tragic?

01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.238
I'm going to live with Martin.

01:30:54.533 --> 01:30:56.494
I want you to know
that I'm really sorry, Bob.

01:30:57.828 --> 01:31:00.456
I really love you. We all do.

01:31:01.916 --> 01:31:03.042
Dad does, too.

01:31:03.876 --> 01:31:07.129
But he's in a really difficult position
and he doesn't have much of a choice.

01:31:08.089 --> 01:31:09.590
It's not because he doesn't love you.

01:31:12.343 --> 01:31:13.636
They bought me a piano.

01:31:17.306 --> 01:31:18.891
Mom told me it'd be here next month.

01:31:22.311 --> 01:31:23.813
They didn't tell you
so you wouldn't be scared.

01:31:30.111 --> 01:31:33.364
Bob, something terrible happened yesterday.

01:31:34.782 --> 01:31:37.118
I lost the MP3 player that Martin gave me.

01:31:39.453 --> 01:31:40.955
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:31:41.914 --> 01:31:44.542
I've lost two MP3 players
in the last ten days.

01:31:46.877 --> 01:31:48.504
So, I'd like to ask you a favor.

01:31:50.714 --> 01:31:52.758
Can I have your MP3 player when you're dead?

01:31:54.218 --> 01:31:56.429
Please. Please. Please.

01:33:18.469 --> 01:33:20.596
Dad. Look.

01:33:24.767 --> 01:33:26.560
I cut my hair just as you wanted me to.

01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:34.985
Good boy. Well done.

01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:39.031
I'm sorry I didn't listen to you
and get a haircut right away.

01:33:40.407 --> 01:33:42.284
I don't know
what I was thinking all this time.

01:33:43.536 --> 01:33:46.163
I would get so hot
and have to comb it all the time.

01:33:47.206 --> 01:33:48.374
It was a total hassle.

01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:52.211
I should have listened to you
and cut it off sooner.

01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:55.172
I'm gonna water the plants now.

01:33:55.589 --> 01:34:00.010
No, darling. I watered them this morning.
Tomorrow.

01:34:02.805 --> 01:34:03.722
Dad.

01:34:05.266 --> 01:34:07.142
I've been thinking about it and I've decided

01:34:07.226 --> 01:34:10.854
I wanna become a cardiologist.
Not an ophthalmologist.

01:34:12.856 --> 01:34:15.109
<i>I lied to Mom because I didn't want her
to get upset.</i>

01:34:17.194 --> 01:34:18.654
<i>I think I prefer what you do.</i>

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:22.366
<i>It's far more interesting and challenging.</i>

01:35:27.264 --> 01:35:30.017
<i>The boy is very good at math and physics.</i>

01:35:31.018 --> 01:35:35.022
<i>Kim, on the other hand,
apart from her natural aptitude for music,</i>

01:35:36.148 --> 01:35:37.900
<i>is very good at literature and history,</i>

01:35:38.609 --> 01:35:40.486
<i>areas in which Bob lags behind.</i>

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:44.907
She wrote a brilliant essay
on the tragedy of Iphigenia,

01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:49.286
which she read out in class.
She received an A-plus.

01:35:50.663 --> 01:35:51.997
What about their behavior in class?

01:35:53.749 --> 01:35:57.461
They're both a little restless, I'd say.
Equally so.

01:35:58.587 --> 01:36:00.923
I mean, I've had the occasional complaint
from their teachers

01:36:01.006 --> 01:36:03.133
about some minor misdemeanors,

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:06.178
but they've never been rude
to any of the staff.

01:36:07.513 --> 01:36:11.684
In any case, if they had ever acted out,
we would have told you about it.

01:36:13.852 --> 01:36:16.063
Do you especially like one of them
more than the other?

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:21.360
If you had to choose between them,
which would say is the best?

01:36:23.487 --> 01:36:24.822
That's a difficult question.

01:36:27.908 --> 01:36:29.702
I'm not sure I can give you an answer.

01:36:33.163 --> 01:36:34.164
I don't know.

01:36:37.251 --> 01:36:38.419
I don't know what to tell you.

01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:57.456
Thank you for bringing them down.

01:38:00.292 --> 01:38:04.713
I really wanted to see them.
I really wanted to see you.

01:38:06.799 --> 01:38:09.843
Hey, Bob. Hey, Kim.

01:38:13.096 --> 01:38:17.142
Bob, aren't you going to come over
and let me give you a hug?

01:38:19.812 --> 01:38:20.729
Bob?

01:38:22.731 --> 01:38:23.649
No?

01:38:25.567 --> 01:38:30.030
I understand. It doesn't matter.
You're a man.

01:38:32.157 --> 01:38:35.452
The man of the house
now your father isn't home.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.330
You can go back to bed.

01:38:41.083 --> 01:38:43.085
Don't trouble yourselves for my sake.

01:38:45.963 --> 01:38:47.464
You can take them away.

01:39:40.475 --> 01:39:45.731
Anna, if you're gonna do something,
you'd better be fast.

01:39:46.982 --> 01:39:48.358
The boy is about to die.

01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:30.335
I believe the most logical thing,
no matter how harsh this may sound,

01:41:30.419 --> 01:41:31.795
is to kill a child.

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:35.507
Because we can have another child.
I still can and you can.

01:41:36.383 --> 01:41:39.302
And if you can't, we can try IVF,
but I'm sure we can.

01:41:51.857 --> 01:41:53.525
<i>I'm sorry for what I did tonight.</i>

01:41:55.110 --> 01:41:56.319
<i>I don't know what I was thinking.</i>

01:41:58.071 --> 01:41:59.990
<i>I was only thinking about myself
and no one else.</i>

01:42:01.867 --> 01:42:03.160
<i>That was wrong of me.</i>

01:42:05.245 --> 01:42:06.538
<i>I was frightened.</i>

01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:10.584
<i>I shouldn't have been.</i>

01:42:14.087 --> 01:42:16.339
Let me be the one
who atones for your sins, Dad.

01:42:16.423 --> 01:42:19.426
Kill me right here in front of your eyes
so that you can be sure that I die,

01:42:19.509 --> 01:42:22.220
in case some fate
spares me at the last moment.

01:42:22.471 --> 01:42:25.265
Kill me right here in front of you
and leave me with the ultimate joy

01:42:25.348 --> 01:42:28.643
of saving my own mother
and beloved brother from certain death.

01:42:40.614 --> 01:42:41.615
Mom, tell him.

01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:43.241
Dad, please.

01:42:44.284 --> 01:42:45.577
I would do anything for you.

01:42:45.952 --> 01:42:48.288
I would even die for you
and here's my chance to prove it.

01:42:50.373 --> 01:42:54.711
They're all asleep. We can go now
and no one will notice.

01:42:56.755 --> 01:42:58.799
All you have to do is help me walk again.

01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:03.929
<i>My legs hurt after all this time
and I feel weak.</i>

01:43:06.056 --> 01:43:08.475
<i>But it's okay. It doesn't matter.</i>

01:43:10.936 --> 01:43:13.688
<i>I knew at some point this would all
be over and you would come.</i>

01:43:21.738 --> 01:43:23.573
I thought we could take
your friend's motorcycle

01:43:23.657 --> 01:43:24.908
and run away together.

01:43:26.118 --> 01:43:27.911
But you have to make me well first.

01:43:31.289 --> 01:43:33.291
<i>I'll untie you if you promise
you can make me better</i>

01:43:33.375 --> 01:43:36.461
and we'll run away together. Okay?

01:43:43.969 --> 01:43:47.556
It's not working. You have to try harder.

01:43:49.808 --> 01:43:51.101
Kim's not in her bed.

01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:56.439
I'm telling you, you have to try harder!

01:43:57.691 --> 01:43:58.859
Are you deaf?

01:43:59.901 --> 01:44:02.737
Martin. Try harder!

01:44:25.468 --> 01:44:27.095
- Where is she?
- She's gone.

01:44:29.181 --> 01:44:30.599
Where is she? What did you do to her?

01:44:45.739 --> 01:44:47.782
I love you so much, don't forget that.

01:44:49.201 --> 01:44:51.995
You gave me life and you, only you,
have the right to take my life away.

01:44:53.079 --> 01:44:54.539
That makes perfect sense.

01:44:57.417 --> 01:44:59.628
<i>You are my lords, my masters
and I am just someone</i>

01:44:59.711 --> 01:45:01.296
<i>who lives to obey your wishes.</i>

01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.471
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:45:10.013 --> 01:45:13.558
<i>Remember that when I'm lying in my grave,
unable to tell you that I love you.</i>

01:45:15.810 --> 01:45:18.563
I love you more than anything
in the world, you and my brother.

01:45:44.673 --> 01:45:45.799
Where have you been?

01:45:47.133 --> 01:45:49.803
I went to the hospital.
Got the feeding formula.

01:45:51.930 --> 01:45:54.266
Have you checked on him?
Did you give him the sedative?

01:45:56.559 --> 01:45:57.519
I let him go.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.358
- What are you talking about?
- He's not downstairs. I let him go.

01:46:07.445 --> 01:46:08.613
Why would you do that?

01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:13.785
Why did you let him go? Answer me!

01:46:14.619 --> 01:46:15.996
Are you a complete idiot?

01:46:19.165 --> 01:46:21.001
It's not gonna make any difference, Steven.

01:46:21.876 --> 01:46:23.837
It's not gonna solve anything.
We both know that.

01:46:58.538 --> 01:46:59.456
Mom?

01:47:00.373 --> 01:47:01.791
Do you remember that day when I was rude

01:47:01.875 --> 01:47:05.420
- to you at the hospital?
- Yes.

01:47:06.796 --> 01:47:08.089
Did you tell Dad about it?

01:47:08.798 --> 01:47:10.467
Of course I told him about it, Kim.

01:47:13.887 --> 01:47:14.929
I didn't mean it, Mom.

01:47:15.847 --> 01:47:18.266
Maybe it was just a side effect
of the drugs or something.

01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:20.477
Kim, can you please be quiet?

01:47:24.647 --> 01:47:27.025
Do your legs hurt? Do they feel numb?

01:47:27.567 --> 01:47:29.986
Does your back hurt? Has it started yet?

01:48:34.426 --> 01:48:38.680
Dad! Quick! Bob's dying!

01:48:40.598 --> 01:48:45.145
Dad! Bob's dying!

01:48:51.860 --> 01:48:52.819
Dad.

01:48:54.696 --> 01:48:55.697
Who's your best friend?

01:48:57.490 --> 01:48:58.616
I don't know, Bob.

01:49:05.623 --> 01:49:06.541
I have three.

01:49:08.168 --> 01:49:09.586
Two boys and a girl in my class.

01:49:11.796 --> 01:49:12.839
That's great, Bob.

01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:16.468
It's good to have a lot of friends.

01:49:50.502 --> 01:49:51.586
Bob's eyes are bleeding.

01:49:55.590 --> 01:49:56.591
Come to the living room.

01:49:57.842 --> 01:49:59.260
- Now?
- Yes.

01:50:01.012 --> 01:50:01.930
Now.

01:50:04.807 --> 01:50:06.142
Steven, where are the children?

01:50:07.894 --> 01:50:08.895
They're already there.

01:50:20.198 --> 01:50:22.283
I think I'm gonna wear
that black dress that you like.

01:50:24.744 --> 01:50:27.830
Wear whatever you want. Just hurry.
