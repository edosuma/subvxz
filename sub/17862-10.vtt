00:00.320 --> 00:01.359
And this new man is, what,

00:01.359 --> 00:03.700
some misguided attempt
to make George jealous?

00:03.792 --> 00:07.351
I'll be appealing to a far more
potent emotion than that.

00:07.352 --> 00:08.392
Do it.

00:11.192 --> 00:14.071
I have a message for Anna.
It's all her fault.

00:14.072 --> 00:17.872
You can't hurt us.
I give Mr and Mrs Dago a year.

00:20.392 --> 00:24.071
Andrew, I think I'd go mad
if I didn't have you to be honest with.

00:24.072 --> 00:26.631
I don't like the degree of intimacy
he's assuming with you.

00:26.632 --> 00:30.791
He's been a good friend to me.
Men and women can't be friends.

00:30.792 --> 00:33.151
Father's lost enough as it is,

00:33.152 --> 00:35.992
but the closer it gets,
the more I think about Jack.

00:37.312 --> 00:39.672
I wish they could both give me away.

00:41.992 --> 00:43.391
Sarah's back.

00:43.392 --> 00:46.111
Is she alone?
No.

00:46.112 --> 00:49.391
Mrs Nordmann and I are getting on
with our separate lives.

00:49.392 --> 00:51.512
I suggest we do the same.

00:52.530 --> 00:57.700

01:03.832 --> 01:06.831
It doesn't count
if it's not in our house!

01:06.832 --> 01:08.631
Put me down!

01:08.632 --> 01:10.671
It's ours for a week.
It is, isn't it?

01:10.672 --> 01:13.391
We could dine out!
Stay in.

01:13.392 --> 01:15.271
We could go to the theatre!
Go to bed.

01:15.272 --> 01:18.351
I'm gonna have trouble
getting you outside, aren't I?

01:18.352 --> 01:21.311
We... we did it.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.191
We did.

01:23.192 --> 01:24.752
We have a lifetime of this.

01:28.232 --> 01:32.112
Mmm! Ti amo cosi tanto.

01:33.232 --> 01:34.752
Ti adoro.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.512
Mmm!

01:39.472 --> 01:41.991
What a beautiful wedding.

01:41.992 --> 01:44.551
I'm glad you were part of the day.

01:44.552 --> 01:46.631
As am I, darling.

01:46.632 --> 01:50.951
I was surprised to see Jack
replace Amo as best man.

01:50.952 --> 01:53.391
Well, he and Gino have become close.

01:53.392 --> 01:57.551
So close? The Italians tend towards
sentiment in such matters.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.872
The new generation.

02:01.392 --> 02:03.031
Perhaps.

02:03.032 --> 02:04.792
Perhaps not.

02:06.592 --> 02:08.072
See you in the morning.

02:12.592 --> 02:15.991
You sure?
She was hinting at something.

02:15.992 --> 02:18.271
You had fairly spurious reasons
to be up there,

02:18.272 --> 02:20.591
and we were radiating
a certain glow.

02:20.592 --> 02:23.471
Yeah. You would just think
that we're happy.

02:23.472 --> 02:26.191
I've always refused
to name Anna's father

02:26.192 --> 02:27.911
and there we three were.

02:27.912 --> 02:29.711
She's not blind.

02:29.712 --> 02:31.391
So, what do we do?

02:31.392 --> 02:32.991
No stress, you said.

02:32.992 --> 02:36.391
Which is greater - having it
confirmed or having to wonder?

02:36.392 --> 02:39.392
For her? Being lied to.

02:41.472 --> 02:46.111
For a part well played. I added
something extra for discretion.

02:46.112 --> 02:49.591
I won't be here to gossip anyway.
I'm on the next ship to London.

02:49.592 --> 02:52.591
I can see you in the next
tawdry West End farce.

02:52.592 --> 02:55.351
Well, consider yourself
a benefactor to the arts.

02:55.352 --> 02:59.071
I'll drop you near the station
and then I'll head to Ash Park.

02:59.072 --> 03:04.111
And you'll, what, hurry hot
and distressed to the front door?

03:04.112 --> 03:05.832
Exactly.

03:07.352 --> 03:09.591
Satisfy my curiosity.

03:09.592 --> 03:11.471
Why this obsession?

03:11.472 --> 03:13.472
George seems rather dull to me.

03:15.312 --> 03:17.471
I was 15 when we first met.

03:17.472 --> 03:21.072
He was the most gorgeous thing
I'd ever seen.

03:23.592 --> 03:25.391
Elaine would never
have stood a chance

03:25.392 --> 03:27.351
if I'd been a few years older.

03:27.352 --> 03:30.831
I'd have had the property,
his heirs...

03:30.832 --> 03:32.632
..his affection.

03:35.752 --> 03:38.831
She rubbed my nose in it
whenever possible.

03:38.832 --> 03:41.471
I swore I'd have him one day.

03:41.472 --> 03:43.831
You missed your vocation.

03:43.832 --> 03:47.832
Your Lady Macbeth
would be spectacular.

If I can see this car,
someone else can.

04:09.352 --> 04:12.231
I didn't mean to stay.

04:12.232 --> 04:14.951
You done good today, Mr Bligh.

04:14.952 --> 04:16.952
Don't muck it up.

04:39.472 --> 04:41.232
There we are.

05:06.752 --> 05:08.471
He's exhausted.

05:08.472 --> 05:10.111
I'm not surprised.

05:10.112 --> 05:13.592
I reckon that tea'd
be brewed by now.

05:16.112 --> 05:17.632
Thanks.

05:19.952 --> 05:21.991
He has to know how much I love him.

05:21.992 --> 05:25.152
He saw how much
you've given up today.

05:33.472 --> 05:35.352
Yes?

05:39.232 --> 05:41.112
Today went very well.

05:43.552 --> 05:45.311
I didn't want to retire

05:45.312 --> 05:48.271
without thanking you for aiding
my rapprochement with Anna.

05:48.272 --> 05:50.312
Goodnight, then.

05:51.592 --> 05:53.551
I'm going away.

05:53.552 --> 05:56.751
Oh, well, a holiday might be just...

05:56.752 --> 05:59.071
I'm leaving Ash Park.

05:59.072 --> 06:01.471
It's time James took over the reins.

06:01.472 --> 06:04.551
It's his inheritance now anyway.

06:04.552 --> 06:06.551
Where will you go?

06:06.552 --> 06:08.111
Sydney at first.

06:08.112 --> 06:10.111
I need to meet with the accountants.

06:10.112 --> 06:11.951
Oh, George, I feel responsible...

06:11.952 --> 06:13.431
It's not you, Mother.

06:13.432 --> 06:15.792
It's not just you.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.631
It's too late at night
for momentous decisions.

06:21.632 --> 06:24.471
I've made my decision.

06:24.472 --> 06:27.991
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Mrs Standish is downstairs, sir.

06:27.992 --> 06:29.831
At this hour?
It's urgent.

06:29.832 --> 06:32.471
She said she only wants Mr Bligh.

06:32.472 --> 06:34.592
George...
Go to bed, Mother.

06:41.352 --> 06:43.711
Where is he now?

06:43.712 --> 06:46.271
I told him he had
no cause for jealousy,

06:46.272 --> 06:47.991
but he insisted there was
something between us.

06:47.992 --> 06:49.831
That's ridiculous.

06:49.832 --> 06:52.791
I didn't know where else to go.
I can't stay there.

06:52.792 --> 06:54.831
What if he comes back?
I'll inform the police.

06:54.832 --> 06:57.351
No. The scandal.

06:57.352 --> 06:58.991
Please.

06:58.992 --> 07:00.551
He needs to be punished.

07:00.552 --> 07:03.392
I just want to put
this whole sorry mess behind me.

07:04.472 --> 07:06.192
I've been a fool.

07:07.392 --> 07:08.872
Here.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.472
Don't cry.

07:17.912 --> 07:19.512
Alright.

07:34.472 --> 07:37.191
Regina's having
a few personal problems.

07:37.192 --> 07:38.792
She'll be staying with us for a time.

07:39.453 --> 07:41.532
Violence was involved.

07:41.533 --> 07:44.493
I'll postpone my departure
until she's feeling more secure.

07:44.531 --> 07:46.890
Departure?
I'll explain later.

07:46.891 --> 07:49.071
George, I see no reason
why you should

07:49.093 --> 07:51.092
tie your staying or going to Regina.

07:51.093 --> 07:52.572
I'll see to her.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.453
You'll be shocked.

07:56.173 --> 07:57.693
What's this about going?

08:03.333 --> 08:05.173
Come in.

08:07.973 --> 08:09.892
Oh.

08:09.893 --> 08:12.332
Oh, so this is the grand plan,
is it?

08:12.333 --> 08:15.252
Damsel in distress?
Tried and tested.

08:15.253 --> 08:18.572
This is outrageous,
even by your standards!

08:18.573 --> 08:20.892
A means to an end, dear.

08:20.893 --> 08:24.532
George is no-one's fool.
His morale is in tatters.

08:24.533 --> 08:26.892
He needs somewhere
to focus his energies.

08:26.893 --> 08:29.492
There'll be consequences
if you interfere.

08:29.493 --> 08:31.932
You coo over the baby and James

08:31.933 --> 08:34.292
all the while threatening to destroy
him for your own ends.

08:34.293 --> 08:36.611
You promise me George
and then renege.

08:36.613 --> 08:39.092
We're cut from the same cloth.

08:41.053 --> 08:42.732
I'll take breakfast in my room.

08:42.732 --> 08:45.652
I don't think I'm ready
to face anyone yet.

08:45.653 --> 08:47.373
Your hubris will be your undoing!

08:58.413 --> 09:00.533
Our life seems to follow a pattern.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.132
In what way?

09:04.133 --> 09:06.893
One problem resolves,
some other presents itself.

09:07.973 --> 09:10.613
Father leaving rather traps us here.

09:11.613 --> 09:13.093
I suppose it does.

09:14.453 --> 09:16.052
I wish we had a choice.

09:16.053 --> 09:18.173
We owe it to Georgie to stay.

09:21.693 --> 09:23.452
What?

09:23.453 --> 09:25.773
No, you're right.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.733
Ash Park is his inheritance.

09:32.293 --> 09:35.252
Darling, would you mind awfully
if I dashed to the city?

09:35.253 --> 09:37.452
Just overnight.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.532
Why?

09:39.533 --> 09:42.692
With your father leaving
and you taking over,

09:42.693 --> 09:44.532
it may be my last chance
for a while.

09:44.533 --> 09:45.972
What about Georgie?

09:45.973 --> 09:48.172
Your grandmother will love
having him to herself.

09:48.173 --> 09:50.732
And you'll stay at the hotel?

09:50.733 --> 09:52.853
Of course I will.

09:54.813 --> 09:57.333
I'd prefer if you avoided
the Swansons.

09:59.853 --> 10:03.252
Your jealousy of Andrew is unfair.

10:03.253 --> 10:05.092
I am not jealous.
Aren't you?

10:05.093 --> 10:07.853
Given what I offer,
another man was bound to appear.

10:09.613 --> 10:12.133
How can you even think that?

10:13.413 --> 10:15.373
I'm afraid of losing you.

10:18.013 --> 10:20.012
If you only knew...

10:20.013 --> 10:21.493
What?

10:24.573 --> 10:26.493
Nothing.

10:28.533 --> 10:31.532
Is this so important to you?

10:31.533 --> 10:33.413
Yes.

10:36.813 --> 10:42.252
Then I will see Andrew
one final time, to explain.

10:42.253 --> 10:45.013
You have to let me do that.

10:47.693 --> 10:49.333
Thank you.

10:52.013 --> 10:55.452
I'm not entirely sure,
but certainly within the week.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.172
You're leaving Ash Park?

10:57.173 --> 11:00.452
I don't quite know
what I'll do without you.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.612
There's nothing for me here.

11:02.613 --> 11:04.212
Where will you go?

11:04.213 --> 11:06.573
I have several options to consider.

11:09.813 --> 11:12.333
If a travelling companion
is ever required...

11:17.093 --> 11:19.012
I see there's a distance to go

11:19.013 --> 11:20.892
before I have regained
your full trust.

11:20.893 --> 11:22.373
Yes.

11:26.093 --> 11:28.253
You'll need friends
in the wider world.

11:38.813 --> 11:42.132
It's just... It's just
Roy shooting rabbits.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.612
Rene...

11:43.613 --> 11:45.173
J'adore.

11:46.413 --> 11:47.893
J'adore.

11:52.493 --> 11:54.013
J'adore.

12:07.733 --> 12:09.373
It won't be long.

12:19.813 --> 12:22.692
Oh, my apologies
for calling unannounced.

12:22.693 --> 12:24.692
I have an appointment
at the hospital.

12:24.693 --> 12:26.652
This will only take a moment,
please.

12:26.653 --> 12:30.292
Regina is attempting to dupe George

12:30.293 --> 12:33.532
by appealing to the quality
we love best in him - his decency.

12:33.533 --> 12:35.932
He may be vulnerable,
but he's not gullible.

12:35.933 --> 12:38.853
He needs to hear the truth about her
from someone other than me.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.052
I wish I could help. I can't.

12:42.053 --> 12:45.732
Regina made it clear James will
suffer if I interfere in any way.

12:45.733 --> 12:48.812
The same threat she holds over me.
She's vicious enough to do it.

12:48.813 --> 12:51.572
Well, you did intimate if there was
anything you could do...

12:51.573 --> 12:53.052
And I meant it.

12:53.053 --> 12:56.853
But I've since decided it's best
George and I don't see each other.

12:59.093 --> 13:01.572
He will listen to you.

13:01.573 --> 13:04.493
He still loves you deeply.

13:07.613 --> 13:10.132
And you clearly still care for him.

13:10.133 --> 13:13.013
George will see through her.

13:15.853 --> 13:17.373
Let's hope so.

13:52.203 --> 13:54.482
How can you read when you have me?

13:54.483 --> 13:57.563
I have to see if Jet Rink
seduces Lesley.

13:58.923 --> 14:00.762
Or me seducing you.

14:00.763 --> 14:03.243
Don't you dare lose my page!

14:04.843 --> 14:08.122
Half of me's still listening out
for footsteps at the door.

14:08.123 --> 14:10.562
We don't have to
sneak around anymore.

14:10.563 --> 14:14.602
A few words in a church and
what was scandalous before isn't.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.562
Sort of silly, really.

14:16.563 --> 14:18.083
Thank you.

14:25.563 --> 14:27.482
Why don't you write one?

14:27.483 --> 14:30.563
A novel?
Mmm. You've read enough of them.

14:30.659 --> 14:33.219
I couldn't.
You've written a diary for years.

14:33.288 --> 14:34.888
It's different!
Why?

14:36.208 --> 14:37.768
You wouldn't mind?

14:41.848 --> 14:44.647
You are not Mamma and I am not Papa.

14:44.648 --> 14:46.727
We don't have to live their lives.

14:46.728 --> 14:49.927
You know, everyone expects you
to tie me to the stove.

14:49.928 --> 14:52.207
Well, it will be fun
showing them how wrong they are.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.248
Won't it!

15:01.288 --> 15:02.927
What did I say about resting up?

15:02.928 --> 15:05.567
I'm too old to be scolded.
Not by me.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.488
You shouldn't be gadding about.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.647
Have you heard the latest news?

15:11.648 --> 15:13.367
Adam seemed charming at the wedding.

15:13.368 --> 15:15.207
No, I mean about your brother.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.647
He's talking of leaving.

15:16.648 --> 15:18.567
Believe it when I see it.

15:18.568 --> 15:20.007
Oh, his intention seems firm.

15:20.008 --> 15:22.287
So any topic which could disturb

15:22.288 --> 15:25.968
his sense of place in the family
should be avoided.

15:27.368 --> 15:29.648
Including your being Anna's father.

15:31.128 --> 15:34.568
I presume that's the reason for
your central role at the wedding.

15:37.008 --> 15:40.688
Please don't be upset.
I've only known myself a short time.

15:42.648 --> 15:46.328
And Anna?
About me, a few months.

15:51.088 --> 15:54.087
I presume you didn't reveal
the father's identity

15:54.088 --> 15:59.847
because you thought
I would turn against Jack.

15:59.848 --> 16:02.928
Everything he had back then
depended on you.

16:06.088 --> 16:07.568
And once I'd...

16:09.728 --> 16:11.487
..given up Anna,

16:11.488 --> 16:13.928
I thought it best
to leave well enough alone.

16:22.368 --> 16:24.008
Excuse me.

16:31.368 --> 16:32.968
I'll go.

16:42.128 --> 16:44.848
Another mirror held up to me.

16:47.768 --> 16:49.728
Would you rather I left you alone?

16:59.368 --> 17:02.567
For 20 years, you could have
been together,

17:02.568 --> 17:05.248
raising your daughter.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.488
But you weren't, because of me.

17:12.968 --> 17:16.127
The tragedy is
I would have approved.

17:18.728 --> 17:20.807
For so many reasons.

17:20.808 --> 17:22.728
Some I'll never explain.

17:24.407 --> 17:26.968
I've always loved you dearly.

17:28.968 --> 17:31.968
I wouldn't have sent Caroline abroad.
I wouldn't...

17:34.128 --> 17:37.327
I would have embraced you
into the family,

17:37.328 --> 17:40.087
despite the obvious differences.

17:40.088 --> 17:43.287
She couldn't have known that, huh?

17:43.288 --> 17:48.327
I've robbed you both of
a lifetime of happiness.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.448
No, no, no.
You tried to protect her.

17:55.288 --> 17:56.927
Talk to her.

17:56.928 --> 17:59.927
She needs to hear it.
It's better from you.

17:59.928 --> 18:02.208
That's not true.

18:06.408 --> 18:09.087
I have always done what is proper

18:09.088 --> 18:11.048
rather than follow my heart.

18:13.168 --> 18:15.728
I expected the same of my children.

18:16.808 --> 18:18.288
I forced you...

18:23.528 --> 18:25.008
No more.

18:28.168 --> 18:30.728
Though it comes years too late.

18:31.928 --> 18:33.608
Mother.

18:45.808 --> 18:47.888
Oh, thank you.

18:53.288 --> 18:55.008
Thank you.

18:57.648 --> 19:00.448
And for giving me the strength
to do what I must.

19:25.128 --> 19:27.728
My solicitor, Mr Davis,
please, Mildred.

19:34.768 --> 19:36.407
Well, I hope you're hungry,

19:36.408 --> 19:38.928
'cause I could eat the arse
out of a low-flying duck.

19:47.968 --> 19:49.448
Rene?

19:52.848 --> 19:54.368
Rene?

20:20.368 --> 20:22.087
Dr Nordmann!

20:22.088 --> 20:25.087
Monsieur! Attention!

20:25.088 --> 20:28.527
Perhaps... wait further back.

20:28.528 --> 20:32.047
In Australia, we stand
back from the rails.

20:32.048 --> 20:34.287
That's it.

20:34.288 --> 20:36.127
Thank you.

20:36.128 --> 20:39.008
I should not be 'ere.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.676
He said, "I should not be here."

20:51.677 --> 20:53.257
It was rather unnerving.

20:53.323 --> 20:56.843
By 'here', I didn't know whether
he meant Inverness or...

20:57.937 --> 20:59.615
Perhaps he's homesick.

20:59.616 --> 21:01.095
Despite how welcoming we are

21:01.096 --> 21:03.255
to those who settle in
our humble environs...

21:03.256 --> 21:05.575
Thank you for your help, Mrs Collins.

21:05.576 --> 21:08.455
In Mr Collins's last years,
silly thoughts crept in.

21:08.456 --> 21:12.216
Illness can weaken the strongest
man's fortitude.

21:32.256 --> 21:34.336
You gave Mrs Collins a fright.

21:37.736 --> 21:39.576
I am sorry.

21:40.576 --> 21:43.376
I truly believe Inverness
can be a good home.

21:44.736 --> 21:48.016
But if I've done the wrong thing
bringing you here, we can go back.

21:52.256 --> 21:54.855
I am leaving for your happiness.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.296
You are my happiness.

22:02.456 --> 22:07.255
Madame Bligh, his mother...

22:07.256 --> 22:09.256
You heard?

22:11.016 --> 22:13.136
I did love George.

22:15.936 --> 22:17.936
It will pass.

22:19.216 --> 22:21.455
Je promets.

22:21.456 --> 22:23.416
We are together forever.

22:34.776 --> 22:36.855
Sorry to keep you.

22:36.856 --> 22:40.495
Father refused to learn the art
of the succinct telephone call.

22:40.496 --> 22:42.975
You're in a good mood.

22:42.976 --> 22:46.575
Unexpected visits from attractive
women have that effect.

22:46.576 --> 22:50.255
Here's my formal acceptance
to his lordship's christening.

22:50.256 --> 22:51.776
Saves on post.

22:53.576 --> 22:55.975
I'm not sure how to say this.

22:55.976 --> 22:58.775
Shall I ask Diana to fetch me
something stronger?

22:58.776 --> 23:02.816
I'm afraid I can't see you anymore.

23:06.456 --> 23:09.615
Grandmother-in-law
or husband beating his chest?

23:09.616 --> 23:11.096
James...

23:12.656 --> 23:14.615
I'm so sorry.

23:14.616 --> 23:18.535
I've really come to care for you
and your funny ways.

23:18.536 --> 23:21.335
You're serious, aren't you?

23:21.336 --> 23:26.616
And I'm sorry, but I must ask you
not to attend the christening.

23:29.376 --> 23:31.375
James is so jealous?

23:31.376 --> 23:34.656
I can't tell him
what really binds us.

23:36.536 --> 23:38.656
I will miss you.

23:40.256 --> 23:43.536
And I will never forget
what you have done for me.

23:45.536 --> 23:47.016
Ever.

23:50.256 --> 23:52.056
Good Lord.

23:54.536 --> 23:56.535
You truly care for me.

23:56.536 --> 23:59.255
Andrew, of course I do!

23:59.256 --> 24:02.375
You must know that.

24:02.376 --> 24:04.416
Yes.

24:07.736 --> 24:09.335
I must go.

24:09.336 --> 24:11.096
Wait!

24:16.736 --> 24:19.136
James is a very lucky man.

24:24.816 --> 24:29.656
That is the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

24:43.976 --> 24:45.656
Goodbye, Andrew.

25:02.496 --> 25:05.375
There's someone moving around
outside. Furtively.

25:05.376 --> 25:06.855
I've heard nothing.

25:06.856 --> 25:08.855
I've been sitting
up there terrified.

25:08.856 --> 25:11.295
I'll check.

25:11.296 --> 25:13.096
You go back to bed.

25:21.736 --> 25:23.256
Yes?

25:24.216 --> 25:26.415
There's no-one. It must have been
one of the workers.

25:26.416 --> 25:28.815
Oh, I feel so foolish.

25:28.816 --> 25:30.855
Can I get you anything? A nightcap?
No.

25:30.856 --> 25:32.615
Thank you.

25:32.616 --> 25:33.975
Well, if there's nothing else.

25:33.976 --> 25:35.455
Stay?

25:35.456 --> 25:37.455
Chat?

25:37.456 --> 25:39.495
I'm tired.

25:39.496 --> 25:42.136
Sleep well, then.

25:53.576 --> 25:57.975
I appreciate your effecting this
so expeditiously, Mr Davis.

25:57.976 --> 26:00.176
Thank you for making the journey.

26:11.096 --> 26:12.695
George?

26:12.696 --> 26:14.855
The deed to Ash Park.

26:14.856 --> 26:17.015
I've changed my will.

26:17.016 --> 26:19.015
Again.

26:19.016 --> 26:22.135
I've signed it back to you.
I've reserved myself a simple annuity.

26:22.136 --> 26:24.575
What about James?

26:24.576 --> 26:26.695
It will come to him eventually,

26:26.696 --> 26:28.215
but you are now the sole owner.

26:28.216 --> 26:31.135
It was wrong of me to use
the property to punish you.

26:31.136 --> 26:34.455
If you think you can buy back
my affections...

26:34.456 --> 26:36.415
Oh, I'm under no such illusions.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.895
More that we can continue
under the same roof.

26:38.896 --> 26:42.575
It's unfair for you to undergo
a self-imposed exile,

26:42.576 --> 26:45.256
so I shall be leaving tomorrow.

26:59.757 --> 27:02.837
I certainly didn't expect you
to cut and run.

27:04.237 --> 27:06.476
I felt sure you'd
stick it out in the end,

27:06.477 --> 27:10.156
rattling around like Miss Havisham,

27:10.157 --> 27:12.797
weeping over photographs,
stopping clocks.

27:14.797 --> 27:16.357
Thank you.

27:18.077 --> 27:21.197
For guaranteeing that
I'll be mistress of Ash Park.

27:47.837 --> 27:49.516
Time for sweets.

27:49.517 --> 27:53.557
Oh! What was all that cake
you just consumed?

27:57.597 --> 28:00.156
Sweets for the sweet.
Oh, Jack.

28:00.157 --> 28:02.197
Caroline Bligh...
Please don't.

28:03.157 --> 28:04.636
What?

28:04.637 --> 28:06.556
Don't do what I think you're doing.

28:06.557 --> 28:08.596
What am I doing?

28:08.597 --> 28:10.357
You're proposing.

28:14.037 --> 28:15.956
Can you at least pretend
to think about it?

28:15.957 --> 28:17.997
I'm sorry.

28:21.917 --> 28:26.516
So after the wedding,
and yesterday with your mother...

28:26.517 --> 28:29.836
Those things brought us
closer together,

28:29.837 --> 28:32.916
but this is one thing,

28:32.917 --> 28:35.197
that is another.

28:36.397 --> 28:38.516
It means one of us
uprooting our life.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.836
Why?

28:40.837 --> 28:45.077
If I say, "Come to the city and
embrace my world," would you?

28:48.397 --> 28:50.316
And therein lies the problem.

28:50.317 --> 28:54.516
Because I don't know
if I can live here in perpetuity,

28:54.517 --> 28:56.837
and a marriage apart
is no marriage at all.

29:03.717 --> 29:05.517
It's not a no, then.

29:08.557 --> 29:10.836
It's no guarantee of a yes.

29:10.837 --> 29:13.277
No.

29:17.677 --> 29:19.756
Perhaps it's time one of us changed.

29:19.757 --> 29:22.077
Perhaps it is.

29:37.797 --> 29:39.637
You're back.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.557
What an incredible turn-about.

29:46.357 --> 29:49.156
It's right that Ash Park
comes to us through Father.

29:49.157 --> 29:51.996
And your grandmother leaving!

29:51.997 --> 29:55.036
It's like the order of
the universe has changed.

29:55.037 --> 29:57.356
Imagine the house without her.

29:57.357 --> 30:00.197
I don't know if I can.

30:02.917 --> 30:05.396
Father will still need my help.

30:05.397 --> 30:07.437
Of course. We must stay.

30:10.877 --> 30:15.357
James, my home is with you.

30:39.197 --> 30:41.837
Oh, I thought you were
playing tennis!

30:43.517 --> 30:47.997
You've been in a funk
ever since Olivia Bligh's visit.

30:52.237 --> 30:54.436
Oh, you HAVE been up to something.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.636
I've constructed
the most beautiful bomb.

30:57.637 --> 31:00.876
I'm not sure now
whether I can detonate it.

31:00.877 --> 31:02.716
I trust that is a metaphor.

31:02.717 --> 31:05.036
Anna humiliated me in church.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.876
I was hoping to return the favour
by doing the same to her family

31:07.877 --> 31:09.436
and letting her know
she was to blame.

31:09.437 --> 31:12.996
Please, Andrew!
Elizabeth Bligh's a dear friend.

31:12.997 --> 31:16.036
Oh, you and your penchant
for baroque revenge!

31:16.037 --> 31:17.557
Calm yourself, Mother.

31:19.157 --> 31:21.516
I always knew it would
devastate Olivia.

31:21.517 --> 31:23.797
But now...

31:25.877 --> 31:28.477
This must be what they call
a conscience.

31:29.917 --> 31:34.036
I have no idea what you're talking
about, and nor do I wish to.

31:34.037 --> 31:37.636
If it's such a dilemma for me,

31:37.637 --> 31:40.277
imagine what it would be
for the blushing bride.

31:55.757 --> 31:59.716
Still not dressed!
Well, it is your honeymoon.

31:59.717 --> 32:01.716
Get out.

32:01.717 --> 32:03.837
Did you tell her about
our last meeting?

32:04.997 --> 32:07.516
He gave me even more of
a reason to bear a grudge.

32:07.517 --> 32:09.076
Would you please leave?

32:09.077 --> 32:12.036
There is a cancer at
the heart of your family.

32:12.037 --> 32:13.676
What are you talking about?

32:13.677 --> 32:16.596
It's all in there.
If this is about James...

32:16.597 --> 32:18.676
Not directly, no.

32:18.677 --> 32:21.396
Then I'm not interested in your lies,
Andrew, whatever they are.

32:21.397 --> 32:26.356
No lies. That guarantees sleepless
nights whether you open it or not.

32:26.357 --> 32:30.556
So, which will it be?
Worrying or wondering?

32:30.557 --> 32:33.276
I said get out.

32:33.277 --> 32:34.797
I'm leaving.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.596
Think twice next time
you donate jewellery to the Micks.

32:41.597 --> 32:43.436
I won't open it.

32:43.437 --> 32:45.997
Then you'll never know, will you?

33:02.157 --> 33:04.396
They're your best results in weeks.

33:04.397 --> 33:06.156
Well, a little certitude
works wonders.

33:06.157 --> 33:09.716
But I still want you to see
a cardiologist as soon as you arrive.

33:09.717 --> 33:12.316
I'll be there tomorrow
to wave you off.

33:12.317 --> 33:14.397
One trusts.

33:16.957 --> 33:21.196
Would you mind if I use your office
for a moment with Mrs Nordmann?

33:21.197 --> 33:22.796
Sure.

33:22.797 --> 33:24.557
Uh, would you...
Yeah.

33:35.797 --> 33:38.357
Uh, I'm not about to
ask anything of you.

33:39.637 --> 33:41.596
But I've come to a decision,

33:41.597 --> 33:43.557
and I wanted to tell you personally.

33:45.037 --> 33:47.276
I'm leaving Ash Park,

33:47.277 --> 33:48.876
for a number of reasons.

33:48.877 --> 33:52.876
And consequently I find myself
in your position of two months past,

33:52.877 --> 33:55.876
traversing the platitudes
of farewells.

33:55.877 --> 33:57.716
We've never dealt in platitudes.

33:57.717 --> 33:59.437
No.

34:01.637 --> 34:06.596
I sensed when we met that you
would ruin my family, and you have.

34:06.597 --> 34:09.716
It's down around my ears.

34:09.717 --> 34:12.556
But I am determined to
rise from the rubble.

34:14.556 --> 34:16.275
I wish to thank you.

34:16.277 --> 34:19.795
I've lived in that house for decades,

34:19.797 --> 34:22.556
spinning a web intended to protect

34:22.556 --> 34:25.516
but weaving a rope
that bound instead.

34:27.237 --> 34:32.837
I've spent all of my adult life
being Elizabeth Bligh of Ash Park.

34:35.757 --> 34:40.716
I have no idea who
Elizabeth Bligh really is.

34:40.717 --> 34:42.677
I look forward to meeting her.

34:45.476 --> 34:47.157
As do I.

34:49.677 --> 34:51.917
My very, very best, Mrs Nordmann.

34:55.437 --> 34:57.517
Elizabeth?

34:58.597 --> 35:00.557
I'd like you to call me Sarah.

35:02.437 --> 35:03.957
Sarah.

35:37.079 --> 35:38.559
Yes.

35:41.010 --> 35:43.010
I am yours.

36:05.501 --> 36:08.340
A smile! That's better.

36:08.341 --> 36:10.820
I think perhaps
I'm getting through to him.

36:10.821 --> 36:13.140
Good on ya.

36:13.141 --> 36:15.260
I long for the day I see a smile.

36:15.261 --> 36:17.181
He hasn't since he came back to me.

36:19.541 --> 36:21.540
Soon.

36:21.541 --> 36:24.300
I'm off to Thommo's
to help with the drenching.

36:24.301 --> 36:25.900
I'll be back before your shift.

36:25.901 --> 36:27.021
Thank you.

36:28.021 --> 36:29.861
See ya.

37:09.421 --> 37:11.900
Thank you, ma'am.
Well deserved, Colleen.

37:11.901 --> 37:15.661
Thank you all for everything.
I shall miss you very much.

37:22.541 --> 37:25.380
Adrift, George was
vulnerable to your wiles.

37:25.381 --> 37:28.620
As master of Ash Park,
I doubt it will be so.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.821
We shall see.
We shall.

37:37.541 --> 37:39.540
Goodbye, my darling boy.

37:39.541 --> 37:41.500
The thought of Ash Park
without you...

37:41.501 --> 37:43.581
And me without Ash Park!

37:45.301 --> 37:48.380
You take care of both
the men in your life.

37:48.381 --> 37:50.460
Georgie will miss you.

37:50.461 --> 37:52.461
Little angel.

37:53.781 --> 37:56.061
I said it was just a matter of time.

38:08.141 --> 38:10.500
Keep an eye on her.
I will.

38:10.501 --> 38:12.621
And be happy.

38:23.341 --> 38:25.101
Cardiologist, remember?

38:36.781 --> 38:39.380
Well, who'd ever have
imagined this possible?

38:39.381 --> 38:41.100
Yes.

38:41.101 --> 38:43.221
Yet here we are.

38:47.301 --> 38:49.501
I hope your travels bring happiness.

40:01.541 --> 40:02.501
George!

40:18.341 --> 40:21.461
You look happy.
I am.
