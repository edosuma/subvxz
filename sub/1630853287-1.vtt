00:38.880 --> 00:42.280
A film by Paweł Łoziński

03:07.759 --> 03:13.520
I told you, not too fast.
Let me see your knee.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.960
It's okay, you're fine.
There's no blood, honey.

03:58.360 --> 04:01.479
Morning, do you have a moment?

04:01.560 --> 04:05.599
I'm making... if you'd please
stop here for a moment.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.960
-Do what?
-Stop here.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.840
-And hold that?
-Hold it? No, it's too short.

04:11.919 --> 04:15.400
-What's up?
-Nothing, everything's fine.

04:15.479 --> 04:18.199
I'm making a film, how are you doing?

04:18.279 --> 04:21.639
-Oh, I'm sorry, I'm not from Poland.
-Even better.

04:21.720 --> 04:26.040
Really, I need to catch the 156 bus,
I'm so sorry.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.600
Hello.

04:29.199 --> 04:31.480
I have a question.

04:31.560 --> 04:35.160
-Where are you going?
-Home, from the river.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.800
-How was the fishing?
-Not good.

04:37.879 --> 04:41.800
-Nothing?
-The water's very low.

04:41.879 --> 04:47.480
-How about a quick chat? About life.
-No. Because life is shit.

04:47.560 --> 04:53.839
-Please stop. I'm making a film.
-Felek, you're going to be in a film!

04:53.920 --> 04:57.639
-I'm looking for film ideas.
-Perfect.

04:57.720 --> 05:01.360
-Hold on, please don't run off.
-I'm a terrible idea.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.399
Hello, Father,
I'm making a balcony movie.

05:06.480 --> 05:09.600
Should I say something
for the sound check?

05:09.680 --> 05:13.759
No, something personal.
On life, the world, Poland...

05:13.839 --> 05:16.560
Would you be kind enough to...?

05:16.639 --> 05:20.519
No, not when I'm with
the Holy Sacrament.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.040
I'm coming with Lord Jesus,
after all.

05:24.120 --> 05:28.800
Hello, I'm doing a sound check.
Would you mind stopping here?

05:28.879 --> 05:32.079
Yes, of course. What is it?

05:32.160 --> 05:34.000
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

05:34.079 --> 05:37.199
I'm making a film about the people
who walk past here.

05:37.279 --> 05:39.920
And...?
-And I ask them questions.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.720
Do you want...?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.439
-Will you answer a question for me?
-What?

05:44.519 --> 05:48.920
I'm making a film about
the passersby, a metaphor for life.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.439
-A metaphor for life?
-That's right.

05:51.519 --> 05:54.439
-It's good, since I'm alive.
-Exactly.

05:54.519 --> 05:57.920
-Where there's life there's hope.
-What would you say?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.079
-Sorry?
-What would you say about yourself?

06:01.160 --> 06:04.399
As long as you're alive,
you're happy, right?

06:04.480 --> 06:10.759
-Sure. Are you satisfied?
-I'm happy. What about you?

06:12.480 --> 06:15.439
-It depends?
-It depends.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.680
Hello, excuse me, I'm...

06:19.759 --> 06:24.839
I'm making this balcony movie
about people who pass by my window,

06:24.920 --> 06:28.240
and I see you every day,
but I don't think we've spoken.

06:28.319 --> 06:31.319
-No, we haven't, hello.
-Could we talk?

06:31.399 --> 06:34.319
-So you live here?
-That's right.

06:34.399 --> 06:37.439
-For a long time now?
-Yeah, 20 years.

06:37.519 --> 06:40.120
I've only been here for two.

06:40.199 --> 06:43.160
-I'm guessing you're French?
-Yes.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.879
-And what are you doing in Poland?
-I work at the embassy.

06:48.639 --> 06:51.199
-Your wife is Russian, right?
-Yes.

06:51.279 --> 06:56.800
-And you work for the secret service?
-I work in the film service!

06:56.879 --> 06:59.120
Yes, I can see that.

07:01.000 --> 07:06.160
A bit closer, please, you've stepped
out of the frame, a bit closer.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.560
I'm asking everyone who they are,
what they want.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.800
You've chosen very trivial questions.
Go on then.

07:13.879 --> 07:19.000
-If you've got better questions...
-You ask, I'm here to give answers.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.519
-Good morning, Pani Zosia!
-Good morning.

07:27.879 --> 07:33.319
-Let's go. Let's keep going.
-Have you got time for a quick chat?

07:33.399 --> 07:36.439
-What sort of chat?
-A short one.

07:36.519 --> 07:38.399
How short?

07:38.480 --> 07:40.240
What's new?

07:42.240 --> 07:47.759
-I'll be around here tomorrow.
-And what are you up to today?

07:47.839 --> 07:53.759
Today I'm going to mow the grass
at 5 Walecznych Street,

07:53.839 --> 07:55.800
at Pani Jadwiga's.

07:57.439 --> 07:59.879
You know her, right?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.720
The chatty one.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.680
-Hello, Pani Jadwiga.
-Hello there.

08:06.759 --> 08:10.639
-Will you come a bit closer?
-God, no, I'm in a hurry to get home.

08:10.720 --> 08:12.839
Just tell me what's new?

08:12.920 --> 08:18.959
On my way back, later, but now I must
go home, someone's there waiting.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.399
Who's there waiting for you?

08:23.040 --> 08:24.519
My lover!

08:26.199 --> 08:28.560
-Hello, honey.
-Hello, honey.

08:28.639 --> 08:31.399
-Short of actors?
-Yes.

08:31.480 --> 08:36.440
The kind who'll stop here for a while
and say something.

08:36.519 --> 08:40.480
And what would you want them to say?
What have you recorded today?

08:40.559 --> 08:43.600
I'd like you to tell me
how to make this film.

08:43.679 --> 08:47.799
But I already told you at home,
I can't keep saying it all the time.

08:47.879 --> 08:50.159
Look what we got at the store.

08:52.759 --> 08:57.279
But I'm not sure if it's clear from
this recording that you're my wife.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.440
-Haven't you introduced me?
-No. My wife, Agnieszka.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.639
-Bye, honey, I love you.
-Bye.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.000
-Hi, girls.
-Hi, Dad.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.480
-What's up?
-I'm talking to Gosia. Gosia says hi.

09:16.559 --> 09:20.399
-Say hi for me.
-Dad says hi, from the balcony.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.120
Gosia, I'm filming from the balcony!

09:23.200 --> 09:26.679
Come to Warsaw, you'll be in a movie!

09:26.759 --> 09:31.559
Dad says you should come to Warsaw
if you want to be in the movie.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
He spends all day on the balcony,
impossible to get through to him.

09:59.159 --> 10:01.440
Hello, madam, hello!

10:01.519 --> 10:04.159
I'm up here, up here.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.720
Up here, please look up!

10:08.519 --> 10:12.759
Up! Here I am, hello.

10:12.840 --> 10:16.679
-Would you go over to that post?
-What for?

10:16.759 --> 10:20.360
I'm making a balcony movie,
talking to people who walk by.

10:20.440 --> 10:25.200
You know what, I'm deaf as a post,
it's no use trying to talk to me.

10:25.279 --> 10:28.960
But I'll talk very loud to you,
I promise.

10:29.039 --> 10:30.879
But I have nothing to say.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.799
I think you have a great deal to say,
just take a few steps back.

10:34.879 --> 10:36.960
But what can I say?

10:37.039 --> 10:40.039
Just a little bit, that's great.
Good day.

10:41.799 --> 10:43.720
Hello.

10:43.799 --> 10:48.000
I'm making a movie about people
who walk below my balcony.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.080
-I ask them, "How are you?"
-How am I?

10:52.559 --> 10:56.080
This old girl don't wanna die.

10:56.159 --> 10:58.279
You know...

10:58.360 --> 11:01.039
Say something about yourself.
Who are you?

11:01.120 --> 11:02.879
Oh, no.

11:04.120 --> 11:10.919
My resume, or curriculum vitae in
Latin, is not, how shall I put it...

11:12.480 --> 11:14.840
-Public broadcast.
-I see.

11:14.919 --> 11:18.919
I've nothing to be proud of,
and nothing to complain about,

11:19.000 --> 11:21.320
I'm glad of what I have.

11:21.399 --> 11:24.720
But I'd like to ask you
about the meaning of life.

11:24.799 --> 11:28.759
-Am I screaming?
-The meaning of life, the point?

11:28.840 --> 11:31.960
-Why do we live?
-Why do we live?

11:32.039 --> 11:35.600
I wish I knew. It's a mystery to me.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.679
-So who should I ask to find out?
-Definitely not me.

11:49.320 --> 11:53.279
Hello, I'm making a film here,
can I stop you for a moment?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.799
-Hello.
-Hello.

11:56.879 --> 12:00.600
I'm making a documentary
about people.

12:00.679 --> 12:05.639
I'm looking for topics. Would you say
something about yourself?

12:05.720 --> 12:08.480
-Me? About myself?
-Yes.

12:08.559 --> 12:13.080
-You're very smartly dressed.
-I'm a girl, obviously.

12:13.159 --> 12:18.279
-Right.
-I work in architecture, design.

12:18.360 --> 12:23.240
Fashion is my greatest passion,
I devote all my spare time to it.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.480
I've got my own blog,
I'm growing my Instagram account,

12:27.559 --> 12:29.559
I do photo sessions.

12:29.639 --> 12:34.879
I'm totally obsessed with fashion,
maybe that's why...

12:34.960 --> 12:37.080
I look like this.

12:37.159 --> 12:40.919
-I hope that's okay.
-Great.

12:41.000 --> 12:46.720
I'm rushing to my friend to download
the latest session we shot.

12:46.799 --> 12:50.799
-I need a hero for my film.
-I don't think it's me.

12:50.879 --> 12:54.480
I doubt it.
I'm off, have a nice evening.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.759
Hello, I'm not sure if you know,

13:14.840 --> 13:20.399
but the store's got
some really good curtain fabric.

13:20.480 --> 13:22.120
Here?

13:22.200 --> 13:27.120
I know your wife said you were going
to be redecorating.

13:27.200 --> 13:31.840
-It's the time for it.
-I can bring you some curtains.

13:33.039 --> 13:37.720
If you need a lamp,
I've got good taste, I'm an expert...

13:37.799 --> 13:40.279
A ceiling lamp?

13:40.360 --> 13:43.399
A ceiling lamp, I could come by...

13:43.480 --> 13:47.080
And I can furnish your flat for you,
it's no problem.

13:47.159 --> 13:50.000
Great, okay.

13:50.080 --> 13:54.600
And if I did a scene like that,
the audience would start to wonder:

13:54.679 --> 13:59.480
"Who's this neighbor?
Is she crazy? Or nosey?"

13:59.559 --> 14:04.440
And my stage partner would now know
he is a neighbor,

14:04.519 --> 14:07.480
but now they'd have decide,
instantly,

14:07.559 --> 14:11.440
if he's an old neighbor
who can't walk anymore,

14:11.519 --> 14:13.600
hence the neighbor's offer,

14:13.679 --> 14:15.759
or if he's young, just moved in,

14:15.840 --> 14:19.279
and she's making a pass at him,
even though he's married.

14:19.360 --> 14:21.360
Or maybe he's not?

14:21.440 --> 14:27.480
Maybe he's not and he'd say to me,
"She's not my wife, she's my sister,"

14:27.559 --> 14:29.159
and we'd have...

14:29.240 --> 14:31.320
And now my character...

14:32.799 --> 14:39.159
I must run, but if I manage
to come here for the recording

14:39.240 --> 14:42.360
I can do a lot of talking,
singing and dancing.

14:42.440 --> 14:45.480
Singing, too?
No one's danced for me yet.

14:45.559 --> 14:47.080
How about a little dance?

14:47.159 --> 14:51.960
'Cos I dance salsa and bachata,
but maybe in the next episode.

14:52.039 --> 14:54.279
One-two-three, one-two-three.

14:54.360 --> 14:58.440
So, darlings, I'll be back!

14:58.519 --> 15:01.519
-I'm Angela, a shout-out to you all!
-Bye.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.559
Excuse me, sir,

15:08.639 --> 15:12.120
I got out of jail two days ago,
could you spare some change?

15:12.200 --> 15:15.799
-I haven't got any.
-Good day to you, sir.

15:23.360 --> 15:29.240
So I wander the streets of Warsaw,
I don't know what to do with myself.

15:29.320 --> 15:34.039
Should go and rob something,
just go back to the old path,

15:34.120 --> 15:36.840
back to jail, 'cos that's easiest.

15:36.919 --> 15:39.720
-Better not.
-Yeah, better not.

15:39.799 --> 15:42.919
I've got no prospects.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.679
I took my high-school exams in jail

15:45.759 --> 15:48.720
and I've got a diploma
for a tiler's apprenticeship.

15:50.960 --> 15:54.240
I dunno what's next.
I've got a lot of...

15:55.879 --> 15:58.440
I came out full of enthusiasm,

15:58.519 --> 16:03.039
but a few days on,
I'm full of rage and anger.

16:04.519 --> 16:07.600
I haven't been aggressive
to anyone yet.

16:10.559 --> 16:13.799
-Where do you live?
-On the street.

16:17.759 --> 16:22.000
Hello, excuse me,
I'm making a film. Hello.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.879
-Hello.
-What are you reading?

16:24.960 --> 16:28.559
-Carl Sagan.
-I can't see it from here.

16:28.639 --> 16:32.080
Carl Sagan, "Billions and Billions."

16:32.159 --> 16:35.799
A highly engaging astrophysicist,
sadly no longer alive.

16:35.879 --> 16:37.559
-An astrophysicist?
-Yes.

16:37.639 --> 16:40.399
And what's it about?

16:40.480 --> 16:43.440
"What is mankind's place
within the universe?"

16:43.519 --> 16:49.840
"Is the Earth threatened by us?
Or are we a threat to ourselves?"

16:49.919 --> 16:52.720
It's about space,
and about everything,

16:52.799 --> 16:56.159
in the thoughts
of this wonderful man.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.600
He wrote what came into his mind.

16:58.679 --> 17:04.079
-So what do you think our place is?
-Entirely accidental and tiny.

17:05.480 --> 17:08.680
We have no special place
in the universe,

17:08.759 --> 17:11.440
we're like a tiny dot of chance

17:11.519 --> 17:15.559
somewhere in the ocean
of unimaginable space.

17:30.160 --> 17:31.720
Hi!

17:33.319 --> 17:35.200
Hello.

17:35.279 --> 17:38.200
How are you? All right?

17:47.720 --> 17:52.720
I am a woman who, by a twist of fate,
has become very happy.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.160
How did it happen?

18:03.559 --> 18:05.480
It's a secret.

18:09.559 --> 18:13.279
But now you've aroused my curiosity.
It's not fair.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.960
Maybe not, but...

18:17.200 --> 18:21.519
my happiness might be
someone else's unhappiness.

18:21.599 --> 18:24.240
That makes me all the more curious.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.039
Perhaps you'd reveal
just a little bit?

18:32.359 --> 18:37.039
Someone has departed
who caused me great pain all my life,

18:37.119 --> 18:43.960
and despite the pain, since
he's gone, right now I'm happy.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.079
Someone close?

18:50.319 --> 18:52.480
Both close and distant.

18:54.839 --> 18:56.759
But like...

18:59.279 --> 19:01.160
like...

19:03.079 --> 19:06.000
-A father?
-No.

19:06.079 --> 19:08.000
-Husband?
-Yes.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.720
-But ex-husband?
-Yes.

19:13.039 --> 19:15.960
Departed as in died or gone away?

19:18.119 --> 19:21.079
Departed and isn't here.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.640
-Simply divorced?
-No.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.480
-Moved out?
-No.

19:27.559 --> 19:30.319
Gone away?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.680
Crossed over to the other side.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.680
-And now life's better?
-It's great.

19:40.279 --> 19:43.960
In a short time,
I've achieved lots of things

19:44.039 --> 19:47.039
I never would have
if I were with him.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.079
And I'm happy.

19:57.400 --> 20:00.240
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.799
But why? I don't get it.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.720
Because I...

20:26.079 --> 20:29.440
I don't want to give up on life,
woman.

20:29.519 --> 20:32.480
And it's worth shit
without a car, huh?

20:32.559 --> 20:35.720
I like my car...

20:35.799 --> 20:38.240
Hello,
excuse me for bothering you...

20:51.440 --> 20:53.240
What a strange format...

20:53.319 --> 20:57.960
You stand there on your balcony,
while I have to crane my neck.

20:58.039 --> 20:59.839
You like to be comfy.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.440
I have to bend over,
it's giving me backache.

21:03.519 --> 21:07.119
Oh, so you're worse off than I am?

21:07.200 --> 21:11.880
-So, what's the meaning of life?
-Oh dear, don't ask.

21:11.960 --> 21:15.200
-I have to go deeper.
-We'd be stuck here till dark.

21:15.279 --> 21:19.559
-I've got the time.
-Well, I don't.

21:19.640 --> 21:24.200
Not to discuss such a serious topic.

21:24.279 --> 21:28.440
The meaning of life is profound,
but it takes time to work out.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.039
What this life is for.

21:32.119 --> 21:36.160
-Exactly. And...?
-What's it for?

21:36.240 --> 21:38.359
To live for someone.

21:39.599 --> 21:43.039
-Not for oneself.
-Who do you live for?

21:43.119 --> 21:45.279
For myself.

21:45.359 --> 21:47.599
-So it's not okay?
-Yeah.

21:52.279 --> 21:54.559
-And you'd rather live for...?
-Sorry?

21:54.640 --> 21:58.640
Who'd you rather live for? A woman?

21:58.720 --> 22:03.440
Not necessarily a woman,
just someone. Another person.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.279
Children, above all.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.440
-You've got none?
-No.

22:11.039 --> 22:15.240
We have to live on
and search for our place.

22:15.319 --> 22:19.359
But that's the meaning for me.
Unfulfilled.

22:41.680 --> 22:45.160
What's important,
for instance, in marriage...

22:45.240 --> 22:48.079
People call
that first infatuation "love."

22:48.160 --> 22:50.160
No, love only comes later on,

22:50.240 --> 22:53.759
once those people establish
a deep connection,

22:53.839 --> 22:59.440
making them essential to each other,
not in a material, physical sense,

22:59.519 --> 23:04.559
but like they're missing something
in life, like air. Literally.

23:04.640 --> 23:10.519
I was fortunate to find this, but
sadly, Andrzej passed on too soon.

23:11.880 --> 23:15.599
From his third heart attack.
I'd gone for a walk and...

23:15.680 --> 23:19.039
-Pan Paweł, I have to go.
-Thank you.

23:19.119 --> 23:23.240
You're welcome. You've got more
interesting interlocutors,

23:23.319 --> 23:25.359
I'm just a chatterbox.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.759
-A bientôt!
-A bientôt.

23:39.160 --> 23:43.720
Hello, I have a question,
could you kindly come over,

23:43.799 --> 23:45.799
under the... hello.

23:47.119 --> 23:49.279
-We're good.
-Okay.

23:49.359 --> 23:54.799
-I thought you needed sound.
-I do, but I need a picture too.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.799
-I'm making a film.
-What kind?

23:57.880 --> 24:01.559
-About the people who walk past here.
-Oh, all right.

24:01.640 --> 24:04.559
-Who are you?
-Well...

24:04.640 --> 24:07.359
I don't know, a person.

24:07.440 --> 24:11.640
What can you say about yourself?
What's your story?

24:11.720 --> 24:13.920
-Sorry?
-What's your story?

24:14.000 --> 24:17.200
I've been doing horse riding
since I was little, competing,

24:17.279 --> 24:20.960
now I'm trying to get lucky
to be able to compete again,

24:21.039 --> 24:25.119
because it costs a lot of money,
but I'm good.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.440
I was a drama student, but it was
too stressful, so now I'm not.

24:29.519 --> 24:32.279
-What year?
-Sorry?

24:32.359 --> 24:36.920
-In what year did you quit?
-The first. I left quickly.

24:37.000 --> 24:40.240
-What a lovely dog you have.
-That's Lolita.

24:40.319 --> 24:43.960
I have Bibi,
but she doesn't like other dogs.

24:44.039 --> 24:47.079
-Nor does mine much.
-All right, I'm off.

24:47.160 --> 24:49.759
And what's that?

24:49.839 --> 24:52.319
-A toy.
-Who's it for?

24:52.400 --> 24:58.039
I gave it to a girl for her birthday
and it's funny.

24:58.119 --> 25:01.519
-What girl?
-My girl.

25:01.599 --> 25:04.920
Cool. Now that's a story.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.880
There's always a story. OK, I'm off.

25:38.160 --> 25:40.519
-The Rosary.
-The Rosary?

25:40.599 --> 25:41.839
Yes.

25:43.160 --> 25:47.240
-Do you always have it with you?
-Yes, always.

25:47.319 --> 25:49.960
You have to say it
at least once a day.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.799
-You do?
-Yes.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.519
-And what makes the Rosary so...?
-Interesting?

25:57.599 --> 26:00.200
-Yeah.
-Everything, the whole of life.

26:01.519 --> 26:04.759
-Oh, wow.
-Haven't you ever heard of it?

26:07.599 --> 26:10.119
I've heard about it.

26:10.200 --> 26:14.799
-And have you said it, at least once?
-Me? No.

26:18.039 --> 26:21.039
I'm sorry, but...

26:21.119 --> 26:24.039
-It's all ahead of you.
-You think?

26:24.119 --> 26:25.440
Sure.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.880
Of course.

26:28.960 --> 26:33.880
-And what does the Rosary give you?
-It gives you strength, power...

26:33.960 --> 26:38.599
Above all, it stops you
from getting lost in life.

26:38.680 --> 26:45.319
It gives peace of mind, and love,
regardless of the circumstances.

26:46.559 --> 26:49.200
And it gives hope of salvation.

26:50.799 --> 26:53.039
-Nice.
-The real thing.

26:53.119 --> 26:55.880
-Sounds good.
-Very good.

26:55.960 --> 26:59.759
-I even feel an urge to try it.
-Do it.

26:59.839 --> 27:02.759
-Three Hail Marys, today.
-Okay.

27:02.839 --> 27:06.319
-Promise?
-Well... I can't promise.

27:06.400 --> 27:09.279
You're closed-minded, after all.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.039
-But are you religious?
-No.

27:14.119 --> 27:16.200
-No? Baptized?
-No.

27:16.279 --> 27:17.680
-No?
-No.

27:17.759 --> 27:20.279
-I can't believe it.
-It's true.

27:20.359 --> 27:23.640
Not baptized at all? Incredible.

27:23.720 --> 27:26.400
-My parents weren't religious.
-No?

27:26.480 --> 27:31.279
But how would you define
your affiliation or worldview?

27:32.519 --> 27:35.160
-Agnostic.
-Agnostic?

27:35.240 --> 27:39.440
But open to the metaphysical
and the mystery of the absolute.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.920
-Maybe more than one.
-I see.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.799
But maybe something, someone,
is watching over us up there,

27:47.880 --> 27:50.000
we don't know.

27:50.079 --> 27:53.519
-I'm open to signals.
-Incredible.

27:57.440 --> 28:01.000
In that case, may the grace of God
come down upon you.

28:07.559 --> 28:10.839
You should make a feature film.

28:10.920 --> 28:16.240
About your project, it could be
a very interesting screenplay.

28:18.400 --> 28:23.880
A guy stands on his balcony and...

28:25.839 --> 28:30.799
I mean, a guy... a filmmaker,
but a guy in general,

28:30.880 --> 28:34.319
anyway,
a guy who stands on the balcony

28:34.400 --> 28:39.039
and records the public's
stream of consciousness,

28:39.119 --> 28:43.720
but you'd have
to cast the actors well,

28:43.799 --> 28:48.240
you could make a superb feature film
out of that,

28:48.319 --> 28:51.920
you could write a story
into the stream of consciousness,

28:52.000 --> 28:54.240
which one passerby narrates,

28:54.319 --> 28:59.799
and it turns out he's connected
with the twenty-sixth in some way.

29:01.319 --> 29:05.640
Something like that
could be very interesting,

29:05.720 --> 29:09.559
in the style of Czech cinema.
But very interesting.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.960
I've found one, but it's striped,
I don't know if...

29:24.039 --> 29:28.880
Makes no difference, that would do,
even if it had spots.

29:30.039 --> 29:32.839
-Is that the way in?
-I'll throw it.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.559
Across? Can you manage?

29:36.640 --> 29:39.200
Watch it...

29:39.279 --> 29:42.440
-On the microphone...
-Incredible.

29:42.519 --> 29:45.880
-You couldn't, if you tried.
-All right.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.880
Jeez.

29:51.960 --> 29:53.960
-Is it okay?
-A perfect fit.

29:54.039 --> 29:58.759
-We're a similar size, it's an "L."
-Great.

29:58.839 --> 30:00.880
I'll fold it nicely.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.759
-It's been ironed.
-I can tell.

30:04.839 --> 30:08.400
-I feel bad about it...
-Don't.

30:08.480 --> 30:13.279
For the photo, it's only to here
or to here anyway, for my ID card.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.759
Maybe just put it on,
it won't get crumpled on you.

30:21.839 --> 30:26.559
Yeah, but I can't go around
like this, I'd look...

30:26.640 --> 30:28.200
True.

30:28.279 --> 30:33.759
I've got a bag here,
I won't put it in my backpack.

30:33.839 --> 30:37.799
Great. What's your name, anyway?
-I'm Paweł.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.319
-I'm Robert.
-Can I call you that?

30:40.400 --> 30:41.920
-I think so.
-Okay.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.079
-Okay, Paweł.
-My pleasure.

30:44.160 --> 30:47.599
-Thanks a lot! I'll return the shirt.
-Keep it.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.039
-It's for me?
-Sure!

31:08.400 --> 31:10.319
-Are you shy?
-I am.

31:10.400 --> 31:14.839
Overcoming shyness is important
in your profession, right?

31:14.920 --> 31:17.480
But in the street, off the cuff...

31:17.559 --> 31:22.200
There's nobody else here
but you and me, it's just us.

31:25.359 --> 31:27.039
I'm recording.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.160
Beautiful!

31:51.240 --> 31:54.559
You moved me,
I had shivers down my spine.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.319
I'm glad.

31:56.400 --> 31:59.400
She's badmouthing you
every other day.

31:59.480 --> 32:04.759
-I can sense it.
-She said you filmed her and her dog.

32:04.839 --> 32:08.839
That's possible, I've had lots
of ladies with dogs here...

32:08.920 --> 32:11.759
-You're a famous local lady-killer.
-No...

32:11.839 --> 32:16.039
Specializing in ladies with dogs.
You better watch out for him.

32:16.119 --> 32:21.079
My wife is listening, don't say that,
especially since it's not true.

32:21.160 --> 32:24.799
Are you on a prescription,
only for your wife?

32:26.440 --> 32:31.279
All the women deserve nice talk,
I'm not talking about some...

32:31.359 --> 32:33.720
But never with ill intentions or...

32:33.799 --> 32:38.759
To me the concept of "ill intentions"
is relative.

32:38.839 --> 32:44.680
So is "betrayal." "Marital betrayal."
How is that betrayal?

32:44.759 --> 32:49.079
It's not betrayal, but if
someone's got that sort of nature,

32:49.160 --> 32:53.000
and likes to eat not only at home
but at restaurants too,

32:53.079 --> 32:57.359
at least he's got a comparison.
Goodbye!

32:57.440 --> 33:01.759
What about your husband?
Did he only eat at home?

33:01.839 --> 33:05.640
I never... A woman is never sure.

33:05.720 --> 33:09.160
But he never made me feel
like he would. Never!

33:30.119 --> 33:32.599
What time will you be home, honey?

33:34.720 --> 33:36.480
What time?

33:37.720 --> 33:40.039
I'll be back when I'm back.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.680
A man's basic question.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.880
Bye, bye!

34:02.240 --> 34:04.519
Hello. Hello.

34:06.319 --> 34:10.639
-Have you got a moment?
-I'm in a hurry to get to the doctor.

34:10.719 --> 34:13.119
-Maybe you'd like to chat?
-About...?

34:13.199 --> 34:15.119
I talk to people about life.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.519
-You've got the wrong person.
-Why?

34:17.599 --> 34:21.719
Because my life is a mess,
at the moment.

34:21.800 --> 34:25.800
Could you come a bit closer?
Why is it a mess?

34:25.880 --> 34:29.960
It's just how it turned out.
It happens.

34:30.039 --> 34:33.880
-Could you elaborate on that?
-It's my birthday today and...

34:35.000 --> 34:41.199
-And... I'm feeling sad.
-You're even dressed in black.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.320
No, I usually wear black.

34:43.400 --> 34:49.880
It hasn't worked out as I wanted it,
and it's the second stage,

34:49.960 --> 34:53.760
where you expect everything
to work out wonderfully,

34:53.840 --> 34:57.760
but it's just completely different
than it used to be.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.280
Meaning...?

34:59.360 --> 35:04.719
Meaning all my plans, everything
I expected from my loved ones...

35:06.400 --> 35:07.840
...is gone.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.320
Meaning?

35:09.400 --> 35:12.320
It's completely different
from what I'd expected.

35:12.400 --> 35:17.559
My whole input, my efforts,
hopes, respect...

35:17.639 --> 35:23.639
everything that's essential
for functioning has gone somewhere.

35:23.719 --> 35:26.639
-Whose respect?
-Say again?

35:26.719 --> 35:29.280
-Whose respect?
-For me.

35:29.360 --> 35:32.280
-But whose?
-My loved ones.

35:32.360 --> 35:35.000
-Children?
-My loved ones.

35:36.320 --> 35:39.039
-Husband?
-My loved ones.

35:41.400 --> 35:45.320
-I'm off.
-I'm sorry. Happy birthday from me.

35:45.400 --> 35:48.880
-Thank you very much.
-Maybe tomorrow will be better.

35:48.960 --> 35:54.280
And maybe next year's
will be all flowers and candles.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.639
-Maybe.
-Goodbye.

36:01.039 --> 36:05.360
I did have a wife, and a second wife,
I haven't got kids.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.599
So there. I don't know.
You want more soul-searching?

36:17.400 --> 36:19.760
This is a bit like confession.

36:21.920 --> 36:25.280
Do you feel good in the confessional?

36:26.599 --> 36:30.000
But, you know, I'm not here as a...

36:30.079 --> 36:36.039
But you demand, I mean, maybe you
don't demand, but you wish me to...

36:36.119 --> 36:40.400
I'm curious.
But you don't have to answer...

36:40.480 --> 36:42.760
But I came here specially today,

36:42.840 --> 36:47.360
because lately I've been whizzing
around in a hurry,

36:47.440 --> 36:52.000
so today I came
because I've got a moment to talk.

36:52.079 --> 36:55.440
It's a good question,
do I feel good in the confessional.

36:55.519 --> 36:56.920
Right.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.440
Because they all come by
and tell you about something,

37:01.519 --> 37:05.519
and you draw them out too.

37:06.880 --> 37:08.280
Do you sleep at night?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.639
Because when you listen to all that,

37:10.719 --> 37:16.719
and you listen to a lot of people
and all sorts of stories, right?

37:16.800 --> 37:19.360
Is it tough or not?

37:19.440 --> 37:22.119
So what's the point of this film?

37:23.679 --> 37:26.280
-I've been wondering too.
-Got you!

37:55.440 --> 37:58.599
-Will this be in the film?
-I don't know.

37:59.800 --> 38:03.519
You'd have to say
something extraordinary.

38:03.599 --> 38:07.920
I love this ice cream.
It's super yummy.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
That's an ad, this is a documentary,
it has to be something real.

38:17.039 --> 38:20.199
I recommend this ice cream,
it's very, very yummy.

38:20.280 --> 38:23.480
Stop, that's an ad,
I'm making a documentary.

38:23.559 --> 38:27.039
-I don't know what to say, then.
-Something personal.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.599
What did you dream about?

38:36.480 --> 38:38.159
I forgot.

38:39.960 --> 38:44.119
-You forgot your dream?
-Sure, I did.

38:44.199 --> 38:47.199
Don't talk so loud into it.
Don't touch it.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
Don't touch it.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.360
You're a rascal, aren't you?

38:57.480 --> 39:01.039
-Come on, say something.
-But what?

39:01.119 --> 39:02.800
A rhyme.

39:04.039 --> 39:06.440
Or sing a song.

39:06.519 --> 39:09.599
-I don't know any.
-What? How old are you?

39:11.920 --> 39:14.360
-How old are you?
-Nine.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.440
-You don't know any songs?
-I do.

39:17.519 --> 39:19.280
Go on, then.

39:19.360 --> 39:23.119
-What can I wipe this on?
-Lick it off.

39:23.199 --> 39:26.360
-It's dirty.
-On your shirt.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.679
But it's brand new, sir!

39:46.280 --> 39:50.199
-Hello, it's been a long time.
-Hello, it has.

39:50.280 --> 39:53.239
-What's new today?
-Nothing.

39:53.320 --> 39:58.079
-Impossible.
-Nothing new, nothing new.

39:58.159 --> 40:01.639
Same old. So-so, the Asian flow.

40:03.719 --> 40:08.519
-Tell me about yourself.
-But what would I say?

40:08.599 --> 40:11.199
I'm a widow, on my own,

40:11.280 --> 40:18.000
I can't get anything sorted at those
offices unless I go there five times.

40:18.079 --> 40:20.920
You need a form,
they haven't got any,

40:21.000 --> 40:24.079
so you have to get it
at Grochowska Street...

40:24.159 --> 40:29.320
It's crazy. I get a referral
for cataract surgery,

40:29.400 --> 40:31.440
ten different tests,

40:31.519 --> 40:36.599
and tell me why they deduct
healthcare contributions

40:36.679 --> 40:40.800
from my miserable pension,
which I worked hard for,

40:40.880 --> 40:46.280
when I have to pay for half the tests
out of my own pocket?

40:46.360 --> 40:50.920
Why don't they let me
keep those deductions,

40:51.000 --> 40:53.800
I could afford private care then.

40:53.880 --> 40:58.239
Not only must I pay,
I have to wait seven years!

40:58.320 --> 41:01.559
I'll go blind before they do it.

41:01.639 --> 41:05.800
That's the real truth!
So where's this state of ours?

41:05.880 --> 41:09.800
The state's a fuck-up!
Record that and broadcast it.

41:17.079 --> 41:21.119
If a registered letter comes for you,
registered,

41:21.199 --> 41:26.159
I have to hand it to you,
and everything has to be tip-top.

41:26.239 --> 41:28.440
But if I...

41:31.679 --> 41:38.400
...have a rattle from China for you,
or a jigsaw puzzle, from China,

41:38.480 --> 41:41.360
and I come up to you,
then you know what?

41:41.440 --> 41:44.800
I'm not a postman anymore,
I'm a deliveryman.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.400
A deliveryman.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.119
They've turned me into a deliveryman,

41:51.199 --> 41:57.199
because they can't go to the store
and buy the simplest thing.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.760
Someone has to deliver it to them.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.519
To their Lordships.

42:03.920 --> 42:07.239
I used to be a postman,
and I was proud of it.

42:07.320 --> 42:09.920
I had a cap with an eagle on it,

42:10.000 --> 42:12.960
I had a uniform, a suit.

42:13.039 --> 42:17.599
And now
I have to buy my own sandals.

42:17.679 --> 42:22.039
I paid 100 złotys just to have
something to walk in.

42:22.119 --> 42:26.320
At the start of my career
I got leather shoes,

42:26.400 --> 42:29.559
it took me three years or more
to wear them out.

42:29.639 --> 42:33.159
I got leather sandals,
I wore them for five years or more.

42:33.239 --> 42:38.480
But now when I get those Chinese
shoes I just throw them away,

42:38.559 --> 42:43.159
'cos they're uncomfortable,
they stink of Chinese glue

42:43.239 --> 42:46.719
and they're not fit
to show in public.

43:26.559 --> 43:30.239
I've got everything,
I have my health,

43:30.320 --> 43:33.760
but I haven't got my best friend,
who died.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.920
And that's...

43:38.440 --> 43:40.599
Who was he?

43:42.000 --> 43:44.079
He was my love.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.719
-Your love?
-Yes.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.920
-Was he your partner?
-Yes.

44:15.679 --> 44:18.360
And how long were you together?

44:19.920 --> 44:21.880
40 years.

44:24.559 --> 44:26.920
Plus a bit.

44:32.360 --> 44:34.960
-Did you live together?
-Yes.

44:41.320 --> 44:43.599
And how did you do that?

44:45.000 --> 44:50.039
-Like he was my brother.
-Your brother?

44:50.119 --> 44:52.400
Your brother and partner?

44:52.480 --> 44:55.440
He wasn't my brother,
he was my partner,

44:55.519 --> 44:59.400
but if anyone asked,
he was my brother.

45:02.239 --> 45:06.079
That's how you did it.

45:06.159 --> 45:09.679
How else could we?
That's what we came up with.

45:11.199 --> 45:13.440
And did people believe you?

45:13.519 --> 45:19.000
Maybe not, but I didn't have any...
you know, because of it.

45:26.480 --> 45:30.199
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. See you.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.760
Thank you.

45:31.840 --> 45:35.679
I wish you the best of health
and an interesting life.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.719
Thank you.

45:55.599 --> 45:59.679
-Hello! Have we had a chance to talk?
-Not yet.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.559
-And could we?
-Yes.

46:01.639 --> 46:05.280
Just come a touch closer to the post.

46:05.360 --> 46:09.280
-You can bring the child.
-He's just gone to sleep.

46:09.360 --> 46:11.920
-Oh. I'm Paweł.
-I'm Judyta.

46:12.000 --> 46:16.679
I'm making a balcony movie,
asking passersby how it's going.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.440
Fine, though we were
in distress just now,

46:19.519 --> 46:22.679
I had to breastfeed him,
but he's fallen asleep.

46:22.760 --> 46:25.800
It's all new to me because
I've had him for three weeks.

46:25.880 --> 46:29.639
-That fresh?
-And we're learning to live together.

46:29.719 --> 46:33.920
-Awesome. Jesus... what's his name?
-Marcel.

46:34.000 --> 46:39.079
-Marcel? Same as my father.
-Amazing.

46:39.159 --> 46:40.800
Oh my...

46:40.880 --> 46:44.079
So what's it like being a mom?

46:44.159 --> 46:48.280
Awesome. I didn't think
having a family would be so great.

46:48.360 --> 46:52.360
So I'm happy,
in need of sleep, but it's fab.

46:54.599 --> 46:56.440
He's a "Madaddy."

46:56.519 --> 46:59.119
-Mama plus Daddy equals "Madaddy."
-Madaddy.

46:59.199 --> 47:02.440
-In one person.
-You're not the mama?

47:02.519 --> 47:06.119
-No, I could be these girls' granny!
-Granny, come on...

47:06.199 --> 47:08.920
-We've got a granny.
-They've got a granny.

47:09.000 --> 47:11.599
She's their aunt. Auntie Monika.

47:11.679 --> 47:14.559
-And where's their mom?
-Not here.

47:14.639 --> 47:18.559
-In another country!
-Another country... some story.

47:18.639 --> 47:22.519
-You're a rare specimen.
-But a hit!

47:22.599 --> 47:27.519
You see, with a father like him,
children don't need both parents.

47:27.599 --> 47:33.400
Audrey Hepburn said each child
needs one person they can trust

47:33.480 --> 47:36.199
and who's going to love them.

47:36.280 --> 47:39.840
One calm parent beats two who argue.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.960
-Please get down.
-Magda, don't touch.

47:43.039 --> 47:46.119
But what's it like, being a Madaddy?

47:46.199 --> 47:51.000
Crapping, shopping, mopping,
every day. They keep you busy!

47:51.079 --> 47:54.159
But I see you also find time
to work out.

47:54.239 --> 47:56.480
-It's a gift.
-You must work out.

47:56.559 --> 47:59.239
-He's an exceptional man.
-Is he?

47:59.320 --> 48:01.639
If he wanted me, I'd marry him.

48:01.719 --> 48:05.400
-I bet you get plenty of offers.
-Lots.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.519
I'm very busy.

48:09.400 --> 48:11.760
So what's happened, may I ask?

48:14.920 --> 48:16.960
Going through a divorce...

48:18.159 --> 48:20.639
There's a third party involved.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.559
And that's all.

48:24.639 --> 48:28.400
She changed me for a better,
newer model.

48:31.840 --> 48:35.119
-Clearly women can, too.
-Yeah, anyone can.

48:38.239 --> 48:40.679
And that's it.

48:40.760 --> 48:43.239
But how are you feeling now?

48:47.639 --> 48:52.880
Not entirely...
I don't know how to put it.

48:57.039 --> 49:00.000
It's just not my thing, that's all.

49:00.079 --> 49:03.239
-Was your relationship long?
-15 years.

49:04.559 --> 49:06.440
Three kids.

49:07.920 --> 49:14.480
14, 13, and the youngest,
long-awaited little girl is three.

49:18.880 --> 49:21.639
Tough, we have to deal with it.

49:24.639 --> 49:29.079
I won't hang myself or throw myself
under a tram, because it's pointless.

49:30.400 --> 49:36.199
It's hard, so if you ask how I'm
feeling, I don't feel comfortable,

49:36.280 --> 49:39.000
I don't know what to do with myself.

49:41.360 --> 49:43.599
I just don't know.

49:49.400 --> 49:52.800
-Things got screwed up.
-We drifted apart.

49:52.880 --> 49:56.320
I keep wanting to ask Iza why it...

49:56.400 --> 49:59.920
-Do I really have to say it?
-I still don't know.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.159
-Why I made that decision?
-Yes, please, you do.

50:03.239 --> 50:06.639
-You don't want it on film.
-It's okay.

50:06.719 --> 50:09.360
I don't have a problem with it.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.960
-You don't?
-No!

50:12.400 --> 50:16.920
I don't know... all right, then.
I caught my husband cheating on me.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.679
-You've got great stuff!
-Great stuff!

50:19.760 --> 50:22.840
And 15 years gone down the toilet.

50:34.239 --> 50:35.960
Hello, Pani Jadwiga!

50:36.039 --> 50:39.599
Hello, goodbye,
I won't stop because it's raining.

50:39.679 --> 50:43.119
-All right, see you.
-See you next time!

51:31.280 --> 51:33.199
Good morning.

51:36.599 --> 51:38.840
-Morning.
-Do you have a moment?

51:38.920 --> 51:41.519
-Sorry?
-Do you have a moment?

51:42.719 --> 51:44.320
A moment.

51:55.159 --> 51:58.400
Come over here, then.
I'm making a film.

52:01.039 --> 52:05.239
-I'm in a film already?
-Have you been sleeping in the car?

52:05.320 --> 52:07.599
-Yes, I have.
-For long?

52:07.679 --> 52:09.800
-One night.
-All night?

52:09.880 --> 52:11.840
Yes.

52:11.920 --> 52:15.000
But I'm heading out for coffee.

52:15.079 --> 52:16.679
That's me.

52:16.760 --> 52:18.760
-Good morning.
-Morning.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.360
-I'm Paweł.
-I'm Piotr.

52:24.599 --> 52:27.719
I didn't see you earlier,
but now I do.

52:27.800 --> 52:30.880
I'm here.
You didn't have your glasses.

52:30.960 --> 52:32.519
And no opportunity.

52:32.599 --> 52:35.320
-I'm here almost every day.
-I bet.

52:35.400 --> 52:39.079
-Do you often sleep in the car here?
-No, it was the second night.

52:39.159 --> 52:43.039
-The second night?
-With you filming, I'll be back.

52:43.119 --> 52:46.840
-Seriously, will you?
-Here? I don't know, we'll see.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.360
What happened?

52:51.440 --> 52:53.599
What do you think?

52:55.480 --> 52:57.519
Thrown out.

52:59.320 --> 53:01.280
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.360
-How did you mess up?
-I didn't.

53:07.159 --> 53:09.159
Long story.

53:11.599 --> 53:14.559
But it's not for long.

53:14.639 --> 53:20.639
-Will you be accepted back?
-The 8th time? I won't accept it.

53:23.519 --> 53:28.280
Choose your own path.
Just do it out of the blue.

53:38.559 --> 53:41.880
Hello, I'm making this movie...

53:41.960 --> 53:44.599
May we have a chat?

53:44.679 --> 53:47.079
-It's about life.
-About life.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.800
What?

53:51.880 --> 53:56.760
-How do you cope with life?
-We were just wondering about that.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.760
-Just now?
-Yes.

54:00.199 --> 54:03.239
-Any conclusions?
-None, yet.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.239
Some very intimate ones so far,
not entirely for the camera.

54:08.920 --> 54:12.440
-Just a little, maybe?
-Maybe.

54:12.519 --> 54:14.719
For the camera.

54:14.800 --> 54:18.239
We are a patchwork family.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.719
With our histories.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.079
Five people, five worlds.

54:25.400 --> 54:27.920
-Five children or...?
-Five of us.

54:28.000 --> 54:30.400
We have three daughters.

54:30.480 --> 54:33.840
-How many of them are yours?
-Two.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.800
And the third one.

54:37.079 --> 54:41.199
In our family there's four of us,
I'm also divorced.

54:41.280 --> 54:45.079
We're moving on somehow.
I've got two daughters...

54:45.159 --> 54:48.239
And...? Is it tough or not?

54:48.320 --> 54:51.719
It depends. It is, really...

54:51.800 --> 54:56.920
It was a huge change for us,
we've just moved here, so...

54:58.440 --> 55:01.280
-We're settling in.
-Looking for our place.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.639
Hello, honey. Come a bit closer,
you're out of frame.

55:10.719 --> 55:13.280
-That's a good thing.
-How come?

55:16.440 --> 55:20.960
-Is this how you see a woman?
-Burdened?

55:21.039 --> 55:27.639
Doing shopping, cooking, washing,
tidying, without you noticing?

55:27.719 --> 55:31.039
Without a "thank you", you mean?

55:31.119 --> 55:35.199
No, without you noticing,
as long as I stick to my role.

55:35.280 --> 55:38.239
You know, I do the shopping too.

55:38.320 --> 55:42.119
-Except now I'm on the balcony.
-Exactly.

55:42.199 --> 55:43.880
-Bye.
-Bye.

56:21.559 --> 56:24.280
-Cool? Perfect.
-Great.

56:41.599 --> 56:43.920
-Yo, man.
-No way!

56:44.000 --> 56:47.639
It's me. I didn't come on Monday
because I got a job.

56:47.719 --> 56:52.599
-How's that? Jeez, I'd lost hope.
-I got a job and all...

56:52.679 --> 56:55.000
Can we not record yet?

56:55.079 --> 56:57.840
Closer to the fence.
No, let's record.

57:00.119 --> 57:01.920
What's been happening?

57:02.000 --> 57:06.440
I got... Everything's okay,
the photos, ID application,

57:06.519 --> 57:09.679
my stuff is with the nuns
on Floriańska Street,

57:09.760 --> 57:11.159
there's a church there.

57:13.199 --> 57:18.119
And I got a job,
but I'm sorry, it's just too much.

57:18.199 --> 57:21.239
I'm working and sleeping
in night buses.

57:21.320 --> 57:24.000
The guy said he pays once a month.

57:24.079 --> 57:29.000
And that we'll sign a contract
when I show him an ID, and so on...

57:29.079 --> 57:31.320
Today I've taken the day off,

57:31.400 --> 57:37.239
I've got to tidy myself up, but
everything is... you can see, sir,

57:37.320 --> 57:40.360
-I mean...
-We're on first name terms.

57:40.440 --> 57:42.079
Paweł, right.

57:44.159 --> 57:46.719
Hello, I've got a quick question.

57:46.800 --> 57:49.559
-I don't speak Polish.
-I do speak English.

57:49.639 --> 57:51.199
How can I help you?

57:51.280 --> 57:54.400
Listen,
I got out of jail a few days ago...

57:54.480 --> 57:56.440
-Congratulations.
-Excuse me?

57:56.519 --> 57:58.639
-Congratulations.
-Ah, thanks a lot.

57:58.719 --> 58:02.559
And I'm trying to get myself
together, and...

58:02.639 --> 58:05.480
I need a little help.
Can you spare some change?

58:05.559 --> 58:09.960
I've got no złoty. I'm only here
to work and then go home.

58:10.039 --> 58:13.280
I need to go to the airport and work.
I've only got euro.

58:13.360 --> 58:16.719
Alright. I accept euro too.

58:16.800 --> 58:21.360
Twenty euros is my taxi home
from the airport. Sorry, I'm just--

58:21.440 --> 58:24.559
No, I'm just joking with you.

58:24.639 --> 58:26.760
-Okay.
-Then I'm going home.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.280
-Okay, have a good one.
-Enjoy your freedom.

58:29.360 --> 58:31.079
Alright, thanks.

58:34.400 --> 58:38.159
-Don't lose it!
-I hope so, I won't.

58:39.760 --> 58:43.639
-What did he say just now?
-Don't lose it.

59:11.119 --> 59:14.079
-Good morning, Pani Zosia!
-Good morning.

59:14.159 --> 59:15.960
Wow!

59:16.039 --> 59:18.760
Wow! Plenty of leaves, eh?

59:18.840 --> 59:23.000
But it's fine weather,
so the leaves are flying.

59:27.719 --> 59:32.599
Lucky it's not raining,
or it would be harder then.

59:33.920 --> 59:37.840
-Why's that?
-Because wet leaves are heavy.

59:37.920 --> 59:41.000
And more would fall.

59:41.079 --> 59:43.599
Rain would shake them off.

59:46.239 --> 59:48.960
As it is, they fall off on their own.

59:52.880 --> 59:55.840
I never met your husband.
Who was he?

59:55.920 --> 59:58.440
-Who?
-Your husband.

59:58.519 --> 1:00:01.639
But he's been dead for 21 years.

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:05.639
Were you even here back then? Right.

1:00:05.719 --> 1:00:09.360
A fattish bloke. Januszek.

1:00:09.440 --> 1:00:12.440
Liked to hit the bottle.

1:00:12.519 --> 1:00:14.000
Yeah...

1:00:16.519 --> 1:00:18.440
Work was "yuck."

1:00:21.440 --> 1:00:25.679
I used to work at the PZO...

1:00:27.039 --> 1:00:29.559
...the Polish Optical Works

1:00:29.639 --> 1:00:32.559
and that's where we met.

1:00:32.639 --> 1:00:34.719
He was a plumber.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:38.440
You know, those factory plumbers.

1:00:38.519 --> 1:00:44.119
How they used to be. Just carried
spanners around, that's all.

1:00:46.079 --> 1:00:50.280
And... they liked to drink.

1:00:51.599 --> 1:00:56.079
And later, when I was forced to...
because I was forced

1:00:56.159 --> 1:01:00.119
to quit the PZO
and take this caretaker job,

1:01:00.199 --> 1:01:04.280
and we came here, he had it made.

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:11.639
Completely. He worked
only if he felt like it, period.

1:01:11.719 --> 1:01:15.280
And I had to work, as the caretaker.

1:01:17.199 --> 1:01:20.920
So I was sweeping and raking,
and he was resting.

1:01:22.119 --> 1:01:24.159
The bottle at his side.

1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.199
Pani Zosia,
have you got five złotys?

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:35.400
I'd buy bread along the way.

1:01:37.559 --> 1:01:40.519
I've just got a 20.

1:01:40.599 --> 1:01:43.559
All right. It'll be 20 then.

1:01:46.079 --> 1:01:49.320
Not a thief's hand. It doesn't fit.

1:01:51.599 --> 1:01:55.840
Sure,
that'll last her till the 20th.

1:01:57.599 --> 1:01:59.920
I've got five, but I'm thinking,

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:04.880
"I'll give 20, or she'll be back
tonight for another five."

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:07.000
What's the point?

1:02:16.239 --> 1:02:21.480
My name's Piotr. I'm trying to find
my place in life again.

1:02:22.719 --> 1:02:27.199
I have someone nearby
who's helping me with that greatly,

1:02:27.280 --> 1:02:30.840
so I'm going to have a chat,
ask a few questions

1:02:30.920 --> 1:02:33.599
and seek some answers.

1:02:33.679 --> 1:02:36.360
Can you say more about your search?

1:02:39.039 --> 1:02:41.239
It's very personal, you know.

1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:49.039
I spent 34 years living in a fog,
then I decided to break free of it,

1:02:49.119 --> 1:02:54.360
and everything I'm experiencing now
is entirely new to me.

1:02:56.480 --> 1:03:00.039
And I'm trying to find my way
in this new life.

1:03:00.119 --> 1:03:03.159
-What sort of a fog was it?
-Alcohol.

1:03:06.239 --> 1:03:10.119
I see. And how are you doing?

1:03:10.199 --> 1:03:12.559
Fine. Fine, only...

1:03:13.719 --> 1:03:17.719
I'm just trying
to look at this world anew,

1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:22.440
understand it, and above all,
find myself within this new world.

1:03:22.519 --> 1:03:26.239
Come to terms with myself,
with my past,

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:29.119
to be able to move on.

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:33.639
-What's it like, being sober?
-Nice.

1:03:34.920 --> 1:03:38.400
-It's good.
-What are the upsides?

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:42.320
You know, the world tastes better.

1:03:42.400 --> 1:03:45.480
And you can hear yourself better.

1:03:45.559 --> 1:03:48.360
Because you're listening to yourself,

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:51.679
instead of sinking in alcohol
to stop the pain.

1:03:54.840 --> 1:03:58.559
-Take care. Have a nice day.
-Thank you, good luck.

1:04:07.880 --> 1:04:10.400
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:15.559
I keep changing my mind a lot,
first I'd like to be this, then that,

1:04:15.639 --> 1:04:19.800
but I can't really decide,
what I want to be.

1:04:21.199 --> 1:04:24.000
What was it first?

1:04:24.079 --> 1:04:27.000
First, my granny always...

1:04:27.079 --> 1:04:32.000
she really, really wanted me
to be a professor.

1:04:35.679 --> 1:04:37.519
A professor of what?

1:04:37.599 --> 1:04:42.599
She always says I should be
a professor, a director,

1:04:42.679 --> 1:04:46.679
but of what she doesn't say.

1:04:46.760 --> 1:04:52.159
Just that I should be one.
But of what... I don't know.

1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:57.639
-Would you like that?
-Yes, but it's...

1:04:57.719 --> 1:05:00.679
Sometimes wanting is not enough.

1:05:03.519 --> 1:05:05.559
Because...

1:05:05.639 --> 1:05:08.440
for instance,
you haven't got the luck.

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:17.320
-I see you're hard at work, filming.
-I'm at my post.

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:22.000
-In all kinds of weather, right?
-Absolutely.

1:05:22.079 --> 1:05:27.000
I'm afraid I'm in a hurry,
because despite the gloomy weather

1:05:27.079 --> 1:05:30.320
I must have my walk
in Skaryszewski Park.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:35.679
I've got to get some fresh air.
But I have some news.

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:38.840
Right here for the viewers.

1:05:38.920 --> 1:05:42.599
-Hold on, in that case I'll zoom in.
-All right.

1:05:42.679 --> 1:05:47.960
Not yet, not yet, not yet...
I still have to focus the camera.

1:05:48.039 --> 1:05:49.960
Not when I'm looking like this!

1:05:50.039 --> 1:05:54.079
-I'll leave it slightly out of focus.
-Do that.

1:05:54.159 --> 1:05:58.400
In two weeks and two days...

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:02.760
my husband and I will have
an addition to the family.

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:05.880
We're going to have a little baby.

1:06:05.960 --> 1:06:09.280
-How did you hide that from me?
-Sorry?

1:06:09.360 --> 1:06:12.039
How did you hide that from me?

1:06:12.119 --> 1:06:14.800
I'm such a magician I can hide it.

1:06:14.880 --> 1:06:18.119
Depends on what I'm wearing.
Now you can see it a bit.

1:06:18.199 --> 1:06:20.760
-Indeed.
-Two more weeks to go.

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:22.599
Two weeks! Brilliant.

1:06:22.679 --> 1:06:24.960
Please don't put it in focus,

1:06:25.039 --> 1:06:28.440
I'm not wearing make-up,
my hair's like felt.

1:06:28.519 --> 1:06:31.920
We don't want people saying
pregnant women look ugly,

1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:36.079
because as you know,
pregnant women can look good too.

1:06:36.159 --> 1:06:40.960
Look, Bolek, it's Lola!

1:06:41.039 --> 1:06:43.840
Lola, over there! Look up!

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:48.199
You don't know where to look
because you're such a dope. See?

1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:50.280
-It's Lolita.
-That's...

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:54.440
And there you go.

1:06:57.159 --> 1:07:00.599
-A beautiful serenade.
-He's turned into a bird.

1:07:00.679 --> 1:07:02.840
-Romeo and Juliet.
-Right.

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:07.960
Oh, Lola, see what emotions
you're stirring?

1:07:10.960 --> 1:07:14.199
I'll tell you what love is.

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:18.559
I've just bought some lovely cakes.

1:07:20.079 --> 1:07:23.039
Now I'm going to close this box,
get in the car

1:07:23.119 --> 1:07:26.760
and drive 500 km,
and I won't eat the cake on the way,

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:30.519
I'm just going to give it
to my wonderful mom.

1:07:30.599 --> 1:07:33.400
And that is love.

1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:36.519
If that's not love,
I don't know what is.

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.079
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:08:14.719 --> 1:08:17.560
A real pro, I see.

1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:19.600
-Robert?
-Robert.

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:26.640
-Jeez, when did I last see you?
-I don't know.

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:30.640
-In July, I guess, in the summer.
-A few months ago.

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:35.159
-How've you been?
-Working, as usual.

1:08:35.239 --> 1:08:37.800
I got my ID card then.

1:08:39.239 --> 1:08:43.079
I'm laying tiles, my fingers
are cracked from glue and grout,

1:08:43.159 --> 1:08:48.399
I can't even wash my head,
'cos my hands hurt so much.

1:08:48.479 --> 1:08:51.800
I've got an honest job.
And shit to show for it.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:59.239
Paradoxically, I work all day, and
beg at night for a place to sleep.

1:08:59.319 --> 1:09:01.760
And sometimes I catch a bite.

1:09:07.439 --> 1:09:12.000
I know I sound as if I'm crying,
feeling sorry for myself...

1:09:12.079 --> 1:09:16.960
I'm not, I'm just burned out.

1:09:28.880 --> 1:09:34.319
I get it, penance is penance,
but come on, how much can you take?

1:09:47.479 --> 1:09:52.640
-I'm making a film from the balcony.
-What?

1:09:52.720 --> 1:09:56.600
I said I'm making a film
from the balcony.

1:09:56.680 --> 1:10:00.159
-What's the theme?
-The theme is life.

1:10:00.239 --> 1:10:03.880
-Life.
-Can we talk about it?

1:10:05.159 --> 1:10:11.760
Could you come a bit closer?
I have a question.

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:14.319
What do you consider yourself as?

1:10:14.399 --> 1:10:16.199
A human being.

1:10:16.279 --> 1:10:21.119
That I can see, but...

1:10:24.119 --> 1:10:26.600
Who are you?

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:31.039
That's what I keep asking myself.
"Who am I?"

1:10:31.119 --> 1:10:33.760
I got my name from my parents.

1:10:38.039 --> 1:10:40.560
My status was ascribed by society.

1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:44.000
But there's no telling who I am.

1:10:44.079 --> 1:10:48.319
It's the question of a lifetime,
and I'm seeking the answer.

1:10:51.159 --> 1:10:53.199
And what do you do?

1:10:56.359 --> 1:10:59.479
Right now?

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:03.159
-Changing the gas meters.
-The gas meters?

1:11:03.239 --> 1:11:04.479
Yes.

1:11:08.119 --> 1:11:13.319
The white roses are in bloom again

1:11:13.399 --> 1:11:17.960
Johnny, come back from your war today

1:11:18.039 --> 1:11:22.039
Come back, kiss me
Like you used to do

1:11:22.119 --> 1:11:26.600
And the prettiest rose
Will be my gift to you

1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:31.039
I would give,
The day you left to fight

1:11:31.119 --> 1:11:35.279
For your gun,
A rose so pure and white

1:11:35.359 --> 1:11:39.560
But before you even went your way

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:43.960
Before you closed the door
The rose wilted away

1:12:13.319 --> 1:12:14.560
Got it.

1:12:18.039 --> 1:12:21.560
-We're celebrating tomorrow.
-Yes, we are.

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:25.279
But not today, 'cos these leaves
have to be cleared away.

1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:28.520
All right.

1:12:30.359 --> 1:12:33.479
Gentlemen, I'm making a film
about various things,

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:36.800
and today's a special day.
What can you tell me?

1:12:36.880 --> 1:12:39.039
Praise be to Great Poland!

1:12:39.119 --> 1:12:41.520
You've got to be proud
of being a Pole.

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:47.159
We must represent with due respect,
and take care of our own home turf.

1:12:47.239 --> 1:12:50.640
-Of our little fatherlands.
-And our big fatherlands.

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:53.159
We've got to understand that.

1:12:53.239 --> 1:12:57.720
Lots of people carry the flag
without understanding why.

1:12:57.800 --> 1:13:03.760
Or how to be a patriot if there's
no war, no bayonets to fix.

1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:06.479
But being a patriot means
caring for...

1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:11.399
-For our little fatherland.
-Work in Poland, pay taxes in Poland.

1:13:11.479 --> 1:13:16.880
Don't drink at your workplace,
be a credit to Poland,

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:19.439
respect the national emblem.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:21.119
Love thy neighbor.

1:13:21.199 --> 1:13:24.720
The basics. God, honor, fatherland.

1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.239
-I'll always fight for that.
-Never forget.

1:13:28.319 --> 1:13:34.760
Historically we've always gone
to battle singing "Mother of God."

1:13:34.840 --> 1:13:38.840
Not with equal rights and faggotry.

1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:41.720
-Sorry.
-Sorry, it slipped out.

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:46.840
God, honor, fatherland!

1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:49.199
God, honor, fatherland!

1:13:54.039 --> 1:13:57.079
Pride, pride, national pride!

1:14:00.039 --> 1:14:06.720
Every Pole, shout with us:
"No to fucking immigrants!"

1:15:04.880 --> 1:15:07.239
Merry Christmas, Pani Jadwiga!

1:15:09.359 --> 1:15:13.279
-You too.
-A very merry Christmas to you!

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:18.279
Please don't say that.
Don't wish me that.

1:15:18.359 --> 1:15:22.760
-So what can I wish you?
-A nice Christmas.

1:15:22.840 --> 1:15:27.479
How can I be merry
without my beloved husband?

1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:30.000
Show some tact.

1:15:33.159 --> 1:15:36.359
A nice Christmas then.

1:15:36.439 --> 1:15:39.239
Thanks for putting me in a good mood.

1:15:39.319 --> 1:15:42.279
I'm sorry, maybe I can start again?

1:15:52.279 --> 1:15:56.920
Hello, honey.
Did you film the first snow?

1:15:57.000 --> 1:15:59.920
-Yes.
-Good.

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.880
-Coming for a walk with us?
-I can't.

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:06.039
Set the camera, press the button
and come on down.

1:16:06.119 --> 1:16:09.399
-I've got to work.
-This is work too.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:14.720
Look how happy she is. Lola!

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:53.119
Hello!

1:16:55.920 --> 1:16:58.800
-I'm looking for a hero for my film.
-Sorry?

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:02.159
-I'm looking for a hero for my film.
-Oh dear, no.

1:17:02.239 --> 1:17:03.479
Why not?

1:17:07.279 --> 1:17:12.520
-I haven't got the self-confidence.
-This could help you to gain some.

1:17:14.279 --> 1:17:16.039
Absolutely.

1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:21.960
-You mean the film you're making now?
-Yes.

1:17:23.560 --> 1:17:27.960
-And do you mean this conversation?
-Yes, sure.

1:17:28.039 --> 1:17:30.000
Be my guest.

1:17:34.159 --> 1:17:35.840
-Come on!
-I can try.

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:40.960
-Yes.
-Just don't be surprised if I leave.

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.760
I have a question.

1:17:49.239 --> 1:17:52.279
Will you make a film
out of these conversations?

1:17:52.359 --> 1:17:56.479
-Yes, I edit them.
-Are you a film editor?

1:17:56.560 --> 1:17:59.720
That too, sometimes.
More of a director.

1:18:01.319 --> 1:18:03.359
And who are you?

1:18:04.840 --> 1:18:06.960
I'm uncomfortable.

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:11.239
But why? The situation is quite...

1:18:12.880 --> 1:18:16.079
Because I'm not so precisely defined.

1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:20.039
Meaning?

1:18:20.119 --> 1:18:25.159
I do various things
but I don't know if I'm this or that.

1:18:25.239 --> 1:18:27.439
What or who.

1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:30.560
But what do you consider yourself
to be, most of all?

1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:37.800
A person whom I'm have not fully
become yet.

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:40.239
I am almost that person.

1:18:42.199 --> 1:18:44.359
And what's your name?

1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:48.479
My name... I do have a name.

1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:05.479
I'm Paweł.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:13.279
For example. I'm Paweł.

1:19:20.079 --> 1:19:22.159
And I am Agnieszka.

1:19:24.119 --> 1:19:26.279
The same as my wife.

1:19:28.720 --> 1:19:30.000
A lovely name.

1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:36.720
And what are your dreams?

1:19:36.800 --> 1:19:39.399
No, I can't just tell you that.

1:19:39.479 --> 1:19:42.039
Do you really think
you can just ask...

1:19:42.119 --> 1:19:47.159
I guess you have no difficulty
communicating, right?

1:19:47.239 --> 1:19:50.199
You probably have no trouble
making contact,

1:19:50.279 --> 1:19:55.279
that's why you can ask a direct
question and expect an answer.

1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:01.960
Am I pestering you?

1:20:02.039 --> 1:20:06.560
I'm pleased I had the courage
to speak to you at all.

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:09.439
I was pleased I spoke to you at all,

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:14.079
I thought I wouldn't be able to cope
with the stress.

1:20:14.159 --> 1:20:19.720
But it turns out I can respond
to someone who decides to...

1:20:22.039 --> 1:20:26.720
...to fish me out, so to speak.

1:20:30.359 --> 1:20:33.760
I'm also glad you let yourself
be persuaded.

1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:42.199
But what will come of it now?

1:21:21.319 --> 1:21:23.199
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:21:24.840 --> 1:21:28.039
-How's your health?
-A bit better.

1:21:29.520 --> 1:21:31.840
-What's that?
-A bit better.

1:21:31.920 --> 1:21:34.279
But still...

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.520
The cough...

1:21:38.920 --> 1:21:42.600
-It's still there.
-But you've got to work.

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:44.960
-True.
-Unfortunately.

1:21:45.039 --> 1:21:48.079
The snow comes and goes.

1:21:48.159 --> 1:21:51.800
What can you do? It needs sweeping.

1:21:54.079 --> 1:21:56.640
Getting up early is not a problem?

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:01.600
-It's easier than in the summer.
-Is it?

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:06.880
Because when I look outside
and see all the snow, oh dear.

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:09.840
You'd be up at 2:00 a.m.,

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:13.600
and you're in the window
till 2:00 a.m., watching.

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:16.039
It's snowing, it's not.
It is, it's not.

1:22:17.359 --> 1:22:19.640
So out you rush, on you go!

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:31.359
Bolek!

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.880
Bolek.

1:22:37.159 --> 1:22:38.560
Hi.

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:45.039
Hi Bolek. You're going to be a daddy!

1:22:45.119 --> 1:22:47.319
-Is he?
-Yes.

1:22:47.399 --> 1:22:51.920
-Do you know how many babies?
-Six, so far.

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.079
-Six!
-Yes.

1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:58.960
-There are six.
-Bolek!

1:22:59.039 --> 1:23:00.600
Bolek, damn!

1:23:03.279 --> 1:23:06.439
-How touching.
-Very, for me.

1:23:06.520 --> 1:23:10.960
For me too. How long's the pregnancy?

1:23:11.039 --> 1:23:13.039
The Warsaw Uprising.

1:23:15.039 --> 1:23:17.119
-Until August the 1st?
-No.

1:23:17.199 --> 1:23:18.920
63 days?

1:23:21.680 --> 1:23:22.920
Right.

1:23:44.439 --> 1:23:47.279
Good day, madam.

1:23:47.359 --> 1:23:50.680
I'm making this film
from the balcony, you know?

1:23:50.760 --> 1:23:52.840
-Sorry?
-Good day.

1:23:52.920 --> 1:23:54.439
Good day, what?

1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:57.039
I'm making this film, you know.

1:23:57.119 --> 1:24:02.199
I ask each person what's new,
I'm looking for a hero for my film.

1:24:02.279 --> 1:24:06.199
-Oh no, I'm no hero, you see.
-Why not?

1:24:06.279 --> 1:24:10.520
Why? Because I've grown old.

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:14.159
You need someone young
and courageous.

1:24:14.239 --> 1:24:16.680
But why? People with experience...

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:22.279
Someone with good ideas for life,
and I've got only ideas for death.

1:24:22.359 --> 1:24:27.119
-What ideas for death have you got?
-No good ones, I'm afraid.

1:24:27.199 --> 1:24:31.039
-Not even for death.
-But what do you have in mind?

1:24:32.359 --> 1:24:36.960
Let's say,
I'm waiting for a surge of ingenuity.

1:24:38.199 --> 1:24:39.560
Meaning?

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:44.880
Meaning the attempt has
to be successful,

1:24:44.960 --> 1:24:47.960
because if it's not,
things get even worse.

1:24:49.399 --> 1:24:53.760
-Thinking along those lines, are you?
-Not thinking, experiencing.

1:26:13.720 --> 1:26:18.079
I regret showing Andrzej, my husband,
too little love.

1:26:19.960 --> 1:26:24.119
That sometimes...
I'm more of the kind...

1:26:26.159 --> 1:26:28.840
I hide my emotions.

1:26:28.920 --> 1:26:31.840
I've only eased up a bit
in my old age,

1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:34.520
but I really regret that I wasn't...

1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:39.439
I didn't take all those opportunities
to show him my love, true love,

1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:44.439
not the husband and wife nonsense,
because that's not me.

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:49.000
-So... all right, goodnight.
-Goodnight.

1:26:49.079 --> 1:26:54.039
Do you know the song, "Goodnight,
I hope you dream of me all night..."

1:26:55.239 --> 1:26:59.000
That was addressed to Andrzej,
not to you.

1:26:59.079 --> 1:27:01.119
I hope I dream of him.

1:27:01.199 --> 1:27:03.880
I often do, and it's already...

1:27:05.119 --> 1:27:10.920
12... 13 years in July since he died.

1:27:22.439 --> 1:27:23.880
Paweł!

1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:29.319
Paweł!

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:44.720
It's just...

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:51.520
I've lost all the values that were
instilled in me as a child...

1:27:53.199 --> 1:27:57.039
And my mom really did
bring me up well,

1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:00.840
to be a decent person.

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:06.840
But it all burst like a soap bubble,
in a single moment.

1:28:08.399 --> 1:28:11.079
-And later on...
-At what moment?

1:28:16.239 --> 1:28:18.800
I don't know, maybe...

1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:23.000
it was the moment when
I first hurt a man, physically.

1:28:23.079 --> 1:28:27.760
-What did you do to him?
-I broke his leg.

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:32.079
-With what?
-A metal pipe.

1:28:32.159 --> 1:28:34.439
Why?

1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:37.359
'Cos he owed money to this other lad.

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.359
But I didn't go to jail for that.

1:28:44.159 --> 1:28:46.840
-And what happened next?
-Sorry?

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:49.760
You broke his leg, and then what?

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:55.039
After that I came along once a week
and he paid me the money.

1:28:55.119 --> 1:28:58.600
I recovered the whole debt
and got a provision.

1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:02.079
I remember it,
I have dreams about it at night.

1:29:04.399 --> 1:29:07.399
I suffer because of it.

1:29:07.479 --> 1:29:09.600
I feel sorry for that man.

1:29:13.119 --> 1:29:17.479
-Did you go to see him?
-What, to apologize or something?

1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.439
No, come on.

1:29:25.319 --> 1:29:27.239
But I want to...

1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:34.840
...pass on as a decent man,
not as trash, a drunk...

1:29:36.840 --> 1:29:38.920
...and a criminal.

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:54.920
You have no idea how I envy you...

1:29:56.439 --> 1:30:00.000
...like, for the situation you're in.

1:30:00.079 --> 1:30:04.720
You're loved, you've got warmth,
you've got a home, a family...

1:30:06.199 --> 1:30:07.800
...a dog.

1:30:17.560 --> 1:30:19.680
Stability in life.

1:30:41.199 --> 1:30:43.479
Cherish it.

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:31.720
-Hello, neighbor.
-Hello.

1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:35.159
Stanisław, please show yourself
to the camera.

1:33:35.239 --> 1:33:39.640
It's not his first film take,
he's been in "Under the Surface."

1:33:39.720 --> 1:33:41.560
-Acted.
-Already?

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:45.439
Yes, he played a newborn baby.
In other words, himself.

1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:49.920
-That's the best.
-He has just sunk into sweet sleep.

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000
I'll go a step further.

1:33:52.079 --> 1:33:55.439
While you're little...
I'll take him out.

1:33:55.520 --> 1:33:59.600
-Staś is beautiful.
-In 20 years you will film a sequel.

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:04.479
-Right.
-Baby, show yourself to the camera.

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:07.720
There he is.

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:14.159
When you release this documentary,
or series about us in Saska Kępa,

1:34:14.239 --> 1:34:17.840
I wonder how tall Staś will be then?

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:20.279
How big will you be then?

1:34:24.439 --> 1:34:27.439
-Pan Paweł!
-Over here.

1:34:27.520 --> 1:34:30.800
I feel really sick,
but I have to go to the doctor

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:33.319
or I'd have to wait till Thursday.

1:34:33.399 --> 1:34:37.239
I'm fit as a fiddle, only here...

1:34:37.319 --> 1:34:41.039
It's probably something
with my hindbrain.

1:34:41.119 --> 1:34:44.119
Not the brain, luckily.
You'll be here tomorrow?

1:34:44.199 --> 1:34:46.039
-Yes.
-I'll come by.

1:34:46.119 --> 1:34:47.800
Okay.

1:34:47.880 --> 1:34:52.439
-I'm walking like my own granny.
-You're not!

1:34:52.520 --> 1:34:55.760
-Oh, really?
-You're speeding!

1:34:55.840 --> 1:34:59.239
My mood's better already!

1:34:59.319 --> 1:35:02.680
-A bientôt, Monsieur!
-A bientôt, Madame!

1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:51.640
-Pani Ania, the meaning of life.
-What?

1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:56.199
-What did you say?
-Pan Paweł's asking.

1:35:56.279 --> 1:35:58.760
-What?
-What's the meaning of life?

1:35:58.840 --> 1:36:03.199
The meaning of life?
Life is meaning.

1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:06.800
That's enough.

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.640
Life is meaning.

1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:15.000
Because if it has no meaning,
why on earth live?

1:38:19.479 --> 1:38:25.880
We would like to thank all
the passersby who confided in us.
