<i>Oh, thank you! What a terrific crowd!</i>

00:45.167 --> 00:48.500
<i>Welcome to my inauguration!</i>

00:48.583 --> 00:52.250
I'm Lucy, Lucy Mirando,
of the Mirando Corporation.

00:52.333 --> 00:56.125
Welcome to my grandfather's old factory.

00:56.208 --> 01:02.708
Now, I know, we all know,
that Grandpa Mirando was a terrible man.

01:04.875 --> 01:09.875
We know of the atrocities he committed
in this space.

01:10.625 --> 01:16.417
We know these walls are stained
with the blood of fine working men.

01:17.167 --> 01:20.958
But today, I reclaim this space...

01:22.042 --> 01:25.000
to tell you a beautiful story.

01:26.167 --> 01:28.875
<i>Now the rotten CEOs are gone.</i>

01:28.958 --> 01:31.917
<i>It's Mirando's new era with me,</i>

01:32.000 --> 01:35.167
<i>and with new core values,
environment and life.</i>

01:35.250 --> 01:36.417
<i>Awesome.</i>

01:36.500 --> 01:38.434
You're much more fun
than the last chief executive.

01:38.458 --> 01:42.083
Well, former CEO Nancy's my sister,
but, uh...

01:42.167 --> 01:43.458
we're very different people.

01:43.542 --> 01:47.375
We have very different ways of being.
We have very different business ethics.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.958
<i>But she's totally ignorant about humanity.</i>

01:50.042 --> 01:52.292
<i>She lacks vision
beyond her next round of golf.</i>

01:53.667 --> 01:56.500
<i>The world's population is
at seven billion.</i>

01:56.583 --> 02:00.542
<i>805 million human beings struggle
with hunger every day,</i>

02:00.625 --> 02:04.042
including 30 million right here
in the United States.

02:04.125 --> 02:08.083
The world is running out of food,
and we're not talking about it.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.167
We needed a miracle.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.208
And then we got one.

02:15.917 --> 02:18.167
Say hello to a super piglet.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.333
<i>This beautiful and special little creature</i>

02:21.417 --> 02:24.792
<i>was miraculously discovered
on one Chilean farm.</i>

02:25.417 --> 02:29.708
<i>We brought this precious girl
to the Mirando Ranch in Arizona.</i>

02:30.000 --> 02:34.125
Our scientists have been raising her
with love and care ever since,

02:34.208 --> 02:38.375
observing and performing various studies.

02:38.667 --> 02:42.708
And we've successfully reproduced
26 miracle piglets

02:42.792 --> 02:45.417
by nonforced, natural mating.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.667
They are like nothing on Earth.

02:54.625 --> 02:59.125
Last week, we sent the 26 super piglets

02:59.208 --> 03:03.167
to the 26 countries
where the Mirando offices are located.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.083
<i>Each one was given
to an esteemed local farmer.</i>

03:08.167 --> 03:12.583
<i>I have asked each farmer
to raise their special guest,</i>

03:12.667 --> 03:16.958
honoring traditional techniques
unique to their respective cultures.

03:17.042 --> 03:20.458
My top scientists
in the Mirando branch offices

03:20.542 --> 03:24.292
will be on hand to offer
whatever support is required.

03:25.958 --> 03:31.542
These little piggies will be the ancestors
of a whole new species.

03:32.125 --> 03:34.000
<i>Mama Nature's gift.</i>

03:34.083 --> 03:36.958
A revolution in the livestock industry.

03:37.833 --> 03:41.167
And now we have a competition!

03:43.708 --> 03:45.208
<i>Yeah!</i>

03:45.792 --> 03:51.583
One local farmer will raise the biggest,
most beautiful and special one.

03:51.667 --> 03:55.417
The ultimate super pig!
But who will it be?

03:58.458 --> 04:02.542
Hmm. I'm not an expert,
but I know someone who is.

04:03.250 --> 04:06.417
<i>TV's most beloved zoologist
and veterinarian,</i>

04:06.500 --> 04:09.583
and the new face
of the Mirando Corporation,

04:09.667 --> 04:11.833
Dr. Johnny Wilcox!

04:12.500 --> 04:15.375
Who said a brilliant scientist
can't be fun?

04:17.541 --> 04:20.333
See, everybody wants to eat him up.

04:20.416 --> 04:21.583
Aw!

04:22.250 --> 04:24.792
When the competition reaches its climax,

04:24.875 --> 04:29.917
Dr. Johnny will crown the winner
at a <i>Magical Animals</i> live telecast

04:30.000 --> 04:32.042
right here in New York City.

04:32.125 --> 04:35.875
<i>And that is when we will unveil
our super pigs to the world.</i>

04:35.958 --> 04:37.667
How long will the wait be?

04:37.750 --> 04:40.583
When do we get to see the big pig
with our own eyes?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.667
Ten years.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.458
Ten years?

04:45.542 --> 04:47.667
Jesus Christ, I'll be dead by then.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.000
<i>♪ All babies together... ♪</i>

04:54.542 --> 04:57.833
Our super pigs will not only
be big and beautiful,

04:57.917 --> 05:01.250
they will also leave a minimal footprint
on the environment,

05:01.333 --> 05:05.250
consume less feed
and produce less excretions.

05:05.333 --> 05:06.875
And most importantly...

05:08.792 --> 05:10.958
they need to taste fucking good.

05:13.292 --> 05:19.208
<i>♪ Oh, when will there be a harvest
For the world? ♪</i>

06:12.542 --> 06:15.000
It won't hurt. Don't move.

06:18.833 --> 06:19.833
It's okay.

06:25.542 --> 06:26.708
Not too hard!

06:37.167 --> 06:38.708
They're not even ripe yet.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.625
You had some already!

07:58.917 --> 08:00.250
Okja!

08:03.542 --> 08:05.250
Okja, what are you doing?

08:07.500 --> 08:11.000
Look at all the fish here!

08:19.375 --> 08:20.625
Okja!

08:20.708 --> 08:22.750
I want fish stew today!

08:59.917 --> 09:01.625
What? Now?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.292
Again?

10:18.750 --> 10:19.792
Mija!

10:22.750 --> 10:24.250
Is she not here yet?

10:24.792 --> 10:25.833
Mija!

10:29.000 --> 10:30.417
Where has she gone off to?

10:42.500 --> 10:49.333
Mija Joo of 37-1, Sanyang Town!

10:50.083 --> 10:55.500
Promptly return home for dinner. Mija!

10:58.250 --> 11:00.958
Come home quick. Grandpa is starving!

12:18.625 --> 12:21.042
Don't be scared. It's a shortcut.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.500
No! Go back up!

14:04.625 --> 14:05.625
Okja!

14:12.667 --> 14:14.000
Okja!

14:20.292 --> 14:21.625
Okja!

14:26.292 --> 14:28.083
Where are you?

14:30.542 --> 14:31.750
Okja!

14:32.583 --> 14:34.208
Okja!

14:59.000 --> 15:00.042
Okja.

16:29.958 --> 16:34.833
Mundo from the office is coming to visit.

16:34.917 --> 16:35.958
Mundo?

16:36.708 --> 16:39.375
To collect the money for Okja?

16:39.917 --> 16:43.833
I've already sent them the money.

16:43.917 --> 16:46.542
So Okja is ours now, right?

16:47.458 --> 16:48.625
Of course.

16:52.917 --> 16:53.958
Hmm...

16:54.042 --> 16:56.167
So why is he coming? Paperwork?

17:02.583 --> 17:05.291
They said soccer would be on.

17:06.708 --> 17:07.708
Hmm?

17:16.875 --> 17:17.875
Huh?

17:17.916 --> 17:19.166
Son of a...

17:19.250 --> 17:21.291
Great. Now we can buy a new TV.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.000
This one's still fine.

17:26.166 --> 17:28.041
Such a tightwad...

18:53.458 --> 18:55.458
Welcome. Hard climb?

18:55.542 --> 18:56.667
Good afternoon.

18:58.833 --> 19:01.417
Here, have some water.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.625
I thought a bunch of you were coming.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.125
They're behind me.

19:07.708 --> 19:08.792
Okja!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.208
Always on top of her dental hygiene!

19:14.417 --> 19:16.500
Wait, wait. Let me out, Okja.

19:16.583 --> 19:17.667
Mundo?

19:18.875 --> 19:20.333
Hello, Mundo.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.417
- Did you brush your own teeth?
- Yeah.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.167
Retina Display!

19:35.250 --> 19:36.583
Bring me the black box.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.875
Does Okja eat and poop well?

19:55.458 --> 19:58.375
Yes, and she has a super high metabolism.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.208
Right. That's what the readings say.

20:01.292 --> 20:02.583
Fuck me!

20:13.708 --> 20:15.042
I'm here!

20:17.542 --> 20:18.542
All right!

20:21.250 --> 20:23.500
I'm fucking here, God damn it!

20:27.333 --> 20:30.333
He... he's that guy!
From TV, right?

20:30.417 --> 20:31.417
He is.

20:32.417 --> 20:35.375
What was it? <i>Animal Magic!</i>

20:35.458 --> 20:38.125
He's the "very healthy" guy!

20:39.792 --> 20:43.792
All the other super pigs were
on flat land, accessible by car.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.208
Japan's one was five minutes
from the airport.

20:48.542 --> 20:52.917
And you... I notice that you had to leave
the fucking mountaintop super pig

20:53.000 --> 20:56.333
till the end, because you knew
that the climb would rile me.

20:56.417 --> 20:58.792
Well, guess what? I'm riled.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.417
Wow.
He looks exactly like he does on TV.

21:06.958 --> 21:08.292
Oh, that's great.

21:11.750 --> 21:12.833
Can somebody...

21:13.458 --> 21:15.750
Can somebody at least
bring me some water?

21:15.833 --> 21:19.042
Seeing as I'm about to be filmed
for fucking television!

21:19.125 --> 21:21.851
And not sparkling water. I don't want
to belch my way through the broadcast.

21:21.875 --> 21:22.917
Get him some water.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.375
I don't think they have
sparkling water here.

21:25.458 --> 21:26.708
Excuse me, sir.

21:26.792 --> 21:30.833
If you don't mind,
Dr. Johnny's a bit thirsty.

21:31.417 --> 21:32.500
Thank you.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.083
Here's your water.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.333
Wait, that’s Soju...

21:37.917 --> 21:41.375
Hey, that’s mine...

21:53.917 --> 21:55.208
Hey, Okja.

21:55.292 --> 21:57.167
It's okay. Come on out.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.917
That's it... Very good.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.625
Well, fucking film me, Jennifer!

22:23.875 --> 22:25.458
You can't fake these emotions.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.583
Oh! Uh, film him. Um...

22:27.667 --> 22:29.375
Get him his uniform. Quick.

22:29.667 --> 22:31.667
Oh!

22:32.250 --> 22:34.625
They're filming!

22:34.708 --> 22:36.684
Pick up his bag. Come on. Uh...

22:36.708 --> 22:38.833
Oh, that's it. Is your... Mundo?

22:38.917 --> 22:42.417
Mundo, get out of the shot, please.
Thank you very much. That's it.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.250
And, uh, his hat. Get his hat.
Looking good, Dr. Johnny.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.726
That's it. Everything's gonna be okay.

22:46.750 --> 22:49.042
Mundo, get out of the shot.
Thank you very much.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.417
And... roll.

22:51.625 --> 22:56.417
Ten years ago, 26 local farmers
from 26 far-flung countries

22:56.500 --> 22:59.250
were each given a super piglet.
This year, I traveled to each...

22:59.333 --> 23:01.292
- What's he saying?
- Dunno.

23:01.375 --> 23:05.750
One of those 26 farms to decide who
will be invited to The Best Super Pig Fest

23:05.833 --> 23:11.000
in New York City,
where it will be unveiled to the world.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.292
You've done an incredible job.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.833
Thank you.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.083
Pan to the old man!

23:17.667 --> 23:20.708
- Oh! Pan to Johnny.
- Johnny, Johnny!

23:20.792 --> 23:23.583
Ever since she was little,
I've always been fascinated with Okja

23:23.667 --> 23:25.958
and her monthly health reports and data.

23:26.042 --> 23:28.417
I've only known her through numbers
and graphs and pictures,

23:28.500 --> 23:29.917
but seeing her here today,

23:30.000 --> 23:33.375
and studying her
with my own eyes and hands,

23:33.458 --> 23:35.542
she amazes me even more.

23:35.625 --> 23:37.708
This is it. The moment of mutual trust

23:37.792 --> 23:42.625
between Mirando's very own Dr. Johnny
and the esteemed local farmer.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.417
She's truly exceptional.

23:53.292 --> 23:56.000
How did you do it?
What were your methods?

23:58.542 --> 23:59.667
Hmm.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.684
He just let her run around.

24:03.708 --> 24:07.417
"He just let her run around."
How beguiling!

24:07.500 --> 24:10.542
Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer,
and go!

24:14.125 --> 24:16.542
- Ready for the festival in New York City?
- New York?

24:19.917 --> 24:20.917
Mm.

24:23.875 --> 24:24.958
Very healthy.

24:27.542 --> 24:28.833
One more sash, please.

24:36.500 --> 24:39.042
A special sash for a special little lady,

24:39.125 --> 24:42.667
who I'm sure helped raise this super pig
in her own special little way.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.417
And cut.
Get some cutaways of the pig!

24:50.792 --> 24:53.500
Here. Autograph, please.

24:53.583 --> 24:56.458
Oh, I guess I'm still hip in Korea.

24:56.542 --> 24:58.958
The kids at home don't really
appreciate me anymore.

24:59.042 --> 25:01.208
But here...

25:01.958 --> 25:05.083
I'm sorry if I was a little grumpy
when I first came to the farm.

25:05.167 --> 25:07.750
But, you know, being
a television presenter can be stressful.

25:08.458 --> 25:11.708
I always have to be "on"...

25:13.000 --> 25:15.542
now that I'm the face
of the Mirando Corporation.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.333
Whoever thought that would happen?

25:21.833 --> 25:25.750
Mija.
Let's go visit your mom and dad.

25:26.250 --> 25:28.708
Now? I want to watch this.

25:28.792 --> 25:31.583
They'll be doing this all day.

25:31.667 --> 25:35.792
Your mom and dad appeared
in my dream last night

25:35.875 --> 25:38.250
and said they missed you.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.583
Come on.

25:40.625 --> 25:41.625
Thank you.

25:48.042 --> 25:49.333
Come quick.

25:50.708 --> 25:51.833
It won't take long.

26:07.292 --> 26:11.500
Who do you miss more?

26:12.208 --> 26:14.583
Mom or dad?

26:16.125 --> 26:17.583
I can't remember...

26:18.250 --> 26:19.250
their faces.

26:22.500 --> 26:27.583
It's been so many years.

26:28.208 --> 26:32.792
Just the two of us in the mountains.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.500
Not two. Three.

26:35.583 --> 26:36.708
Huh?

26:38.333 --> 26:40.583
Oh, sure. Three.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.000
The three of us.

26:47.292 --> 26:49.250
Okja, too.

26:53.458 --> 26:54.833
Ta-da!

26:54.917 --> 26:57.042
Our little fatty!

26:58.667 --> 26:59.667
What's that?

27:00.708 --> 27:01.708
This is...

27:02.417 --> 27:03.583
a gold pig.

27:05.375 --> 27:08.333
100% real gold.

27:09.167 --> 27:10.917
In the old days,

27:11.000 --> 27:17.708
the elders would give a gold pig
to their daughters as a wedding gift.

27:18.542 --> 27:21.833
Mija, it's yours now.

27:22.583 --> 27:23.583
Take it.

27:24.917 --> 27:26.958
Why all of a sudden?

27:37.500 --> 27:41.875
Well, you're not getting married now...

27:43.500 --> 27:49.417
but... Okja is going far away...

27:50.583 --> 27:57.250
so you can keep this gold pig instead.

27:58.417 --> 27:59.625
What?

28:00.167 --> 28:05.458
The pig competition's nearly over.

28:06.208 --> 28:10.042
So they're taking all the pigs back
to the company.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.208
But Okja's ours.

28:12.917 --> 28:14.375
We bought her from them.

28:15.042 --> 28:17.208
You sent them the money!

28:18.333 --> 28:19.625
Actually...

28:19.708 --> 28:22.792
they wouldn't let me buy Okja.

28:22.875 --> 28:27.000
So I bought you this gold pig instead.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.292
- What are you talking about?!
- Huh?

28:35.042 --> 28:36.625
Hey, did you hear that?

28:37.500 --> 28:41.750
Your daughter raises her voice at me now.

28:46.750 --> 28:47.750
Mija.

28:48.458 --> 28:55.042
They say Okja was selected
as the best pig.

28:55.125 --> 28:58.542
They have plans for her in America.

28:58.625 --> 28:59.917
America?

29:00.000 --> 29:05.375
She'll spend the night
at the Mirando building in Seoul.

29:05.958 --> 29:10.917
And tomorrow,
she'll be on a plane to America.

29:13.125 --> 29:17.375
She's a celebrity now!

29:21.958 --> 29:22.958
Mija.

29:23.792 --> 29:26.292
To be honest...

29:27.000 --> 29:29.667
you're nearly a grown woman now.

29:29.750 --> 29:36.542
I don't like you playing
with that pig all day.

29:37.042 --> 29:41.500
You should go to town, meet a boy and...

31:05.500 --> 31:06.583
Okja...

31:29.750 --> 31:30.875
Hmm!

32:05.167 --> 32:07.250
You must be hungry.

32:08.333 --> 32:12.250
I made your favorite, chicken stew.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.458
Go wash up so we can eat.

32:14.542 --> 32:17.250
I put in this and that.

32:18.958 --> 32:22.417
Everything that's good for you.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.833
Where are you going?

32:28.792 --> 32:29.792
Seoul.

32:30.542 --> 32:31.583
What?

32:32.292 --> 32:33.917
I'm going to bring Okja home.

32:34.458 --> 32:36.125
Are you crazy?

32:36.208 --> 32:40.125
Seoul? In the middle of the night?

32:40.208 --> 32:43.000
You have no money to go to Seoul.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.083
Stop! It's dangerous. Don't move!

32:50.167 --> 32:51.792
Oh, my God...

32:52.750 --> 32:54.417
Oh, God...

32:54.500 --> 32:55.750
Go away, you'll get hurt!

33:00.375 --> 33:03.042
Where do you think you're going?

33:03.125 --> 33:04.792
You're not going anywhere!

33:10.000 --> 33:11.042
Stop right there!

33:28.042 --> 33:31.208
Blade shoulder! Loin! Spare rib! Hock!

33:31.833 --> 33:32.833
Got it?

33:34.833 --> 33:38.000
This is what will happen to her.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.333
This is Okja's fate!

33:41.042 --> 33:42.167
Fate!

33:44.125 --> 33:45.125
Mija.

33:51.417 --> 33:53.083
Mija! Mija!

33:56.042 --> 33:57.083
Mija!

33:58.667 --> 33:59.667
Mija!

34:01.792 --> 34:03.375
Mija!

35:23.792 --> 35:25.792
Excuse me!

35:35.875 --> 35:37.083
I'm here for Okja!

35:38.625 --> 35:40.917
Use the phone.

35:57.042 --> 35:59.083
Hey, could you come to the lobby?

36:01.333 --> 36:05.375
No, some kid is here.
She wants me to open the door.

36:05.458 --> 36:08.000
<i>Please state the name you are looking for.</i>

36:08.708 --> 36:10.833
M-U-N-D-O.

36:10.917 --> 36:12.583
<i>Sorry, please speak clearly.</i>

36:13.250 --> 36:16.750
You can't just send anybody up here.

36:18.375 --> 36:20.292
Screen these people, okay?

36:20.375 --> 36:23.125
M-U-N-D-O!

36:25.875 --> 36:27.125
Excuse me!

36:29.792 --> 36:30.833
Excuse me!

36:59.542 --> 37:01.000
What the...

37:10.625 --> 37:13.167
You little bitch! Hey!

37:16.958 --> 37:18.375
Mundo!

37:37.292 --> 37:38.208
Hey!

37:38.292 --> 37:39.667
You little shit!

37:39.750 --> 37:42.708
- Stay where you are!
- Hey! Stop!

37:47.167 --> 37:49.542
Just open the door!

37:50.667 --> 37:53.208
Open the door so we can talk.

37:53.292 --> 37:54.292
Hey!

37:55.750 --> 37:58.083
Open the damn door!

37:58.167 --> 37:59.167
Okja!

38:02.667 --> 38:05.250
Okja! Okja!

38:06.083 --> 38:09.917
Come on, you guys. Stop taking photos,
okay? This is classified.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.500
These are direct orders
from HQ in America.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.458
No photos!

38:14.542 --> 38:19.208
I don't want to see anything
on Instagram or Facebook. Okay?

38:20.500 --> 38:22.020
Okja! Okja!

38:22.083 --> 38:24.667
Okja, I'm here! Okja!

38:24.750 --> 38:27.167
Let's talk!
Where are you going?

38:28.125 --> 38:29.125
Wait! No, stop!

38:46.417 --> 38:50.250
Look how tall the truck is! Right?

38:54.625 --> 38:55.667
Are you new here?

39:00.833 --> 39:02.125
Call the police!

39:02.208 --> 39:03.833
Wait! Stop! Damn it!

40:09.667 --> 40:13.000
What does that say? 4.2...

40:13.958 --> 40:17.542
This isn't taller than 4.2 meters, is it?
Is it?

40:19.042 --> 40:20.042
Oh!

40:24.208 --> 40:28.333
Do you have a license to drive this thing?

40:28.417 --> 40:29.542
A commercial license?

40:36.667 --> 40:40.167
Wait! Hey! Come on, now! Hey, no!

40:48.208 --> 40:50.958
Okja! Okja!

40:51.042 --> 40:53.750
Okja!

40:54.375 --> 40:56.708
What now? What's that noise?

40:57.875 --> 40:58.875
What's that?

41:09.625 --> 41:11.208
What the hell?

41:17.208 --> 41:18.375
Nice to meet you.

41:19.625 --> 41:20.917
We're not terrorists!

41:21.750 --> 41:22.833
What?

41:22.917 --> 41:24.250
We don't like violence!

41:25.000 --> 41:26.875
We don't want to hurt you!

41:26.958 --> 41:30.250
Stop... stop the truck!

41:31.667 --> 41:33.083
What the hell is he saying?

41:33.167 --> 41:34.333
Stop...

41:34.417 --> 41:36.375
Just cooperate, guy.

41:36.458 --> 41:37.500
What?

41:59.458 --> 42:00.375
Hi.

42:00.458 --> 42:03.083
- Hey. Hey, over here!
- What's going on?

42:03.167 --> 42:05.625
Hey, old man! Safety!

42:06.625 --> 42:08.042
I don't think he gets it!

42:08.917 --> 42:12.417
Buckle! Buckle!

42:12.500 --> 42:14.375
Put on your seat belt!

42:14.458 --> 42:16.417
'Cause we're gonna come
on board now, right?

42:16.500 --> 42:21.875
But we're not gonna hurt you.
You'll be okay. Yes? Okay.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.000
No compromise!

42:51.250 --> 42:53.708
Hey! Hands up!

42:53.792 --> 42:56.032
- We come in peace! Drop that!
- Stay back!

42:56.667 --> 42:59.000
Hello? Police?

42:59.083 --> 43:01.125
Terrorists! There are terrorists here!

43:01.833 --> 43:03.208
Hey!

43:15.542 --> 43:17.042
What's he writing?

43:19.458 --> 43:21.583
Is this fucking amusing to you?

43:21.667 --> 43:24.667
It's not mine. It's company property.

43:28.125 --> 43:31.042
Everybody follow...

43:31.292 --> 43:32.917
Okja!

43:42.625 --> 43:43.667
Okja!

43:44.625 --> 43:47.375
Hold her! Hold her!

43:47.458 --> 43:49.167
No, no. No!

44:03.083 --> 44:04.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:06.375 --> 44:08.333
- Hey! Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, stop!

44:09.458 --> 44:10.625
Catch her!

44:13.500 --> 44:14.667
Everybody in the van!

44:19.042 --> 44:21.583
They're leaving!
Start the truck! Quick!

44:22.292 --> 44:24.208
- Fuck it.
- What?

44:24.292 --> 44:27.792
What do I care?
I'm leaving this shithole anyway.

44:27.875 --> 44:28.875
Huh?

44:29.875 --> 44:30.917
You know what?

44:32.500 --> 44:35.458
I do have a commercial license,
but I don’t have workman’s comp.

44:37.750 --> 44:40.500
Insurance? You want insurance?

44:41.125 --> 44:43.417
Then show some loyalty to the company!

44:43.500 --> 44:46.167
This is what company loyalty looks like!

44:55.042 --> 44:56.042
This way!

44:57.458 --> 44:58.500
Go!

45:06.542 --> 45:07.875
I'm sorry!

45:10.167 --> 45:11.667
Get out of the way!

45:27.292 --> 45:30.542
Oh!

45:33.625 --> 45:34.750
Watch out!

45:58.750 --> 45:59.750

49:48.500 --> 49:49.792
Fruity Lucy Lemon?

49:50.458 --> 49:53.351
The girl showed up, so I'm
providing the team with unfolding intel.

49:53.375 --> 49:55.059
- I don't care. Sounds creepy.
- I'm not creepy.

49:55.083 --> 49:57.203
That's not... That's my voice.
That's my actual voice.

49:57.250 --> 49:58.833
Can you translate?

50:11.125 --> 50:12.417
My name is Jay.

50:14.958 --> 50:16.167
He's Jay.

50:17.625 --> 50:19.125
My name is K.

50:21.750 --> 50:22.750
I'm Red.

50:25.083 --> 50:27.250
- Silver.
- I'm Blond.

50:34.625 --> 50:37.958
I'm Mija. This is Okja.

50:38.042 --> 50:39.750
We are animal lovers.

50:43.333 --> 50:46.625
We rescue animals
from slaughterhouses, zoos, labs.

50:46.708 --> 50:49.667
We tear down cages and set them free.

50:49.750 --> 50:53.708
This is why we rescued Okja.

51:06.750 --> 51:08.150
Thank you very much.

51:09.500 --> 51:14.792
For 40 years, our group has liberated
animals from places of abuse.

51:18.583 --> 51:20.208
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

51:22.208 --> 51:23.208
Go on.

51:24.375 --> 51:27.833
- It's very important she gets every word.
- It's all right. That's it.

51:27.917 --> 51:31.375
We inflict economic damage on those
who profit from their misery.

51:31.458 --> 51:33.875
We reveal their atrocities to the public.

51:33.958 --> 51:37.458
And we never harm anyone,
human or nonhuman.

51:37.542 --> 51:40.250
That is our 40-year credo.

51:41.542 --> 51:43.833
We...

51:43.958 --> 51:46.083
fight people who harm animals...

51:46.875 --> 51:48.643
What was the second thing you said?

51:48.667 --> 51:50.893
- We reveal their atrocities...
- Yeah.

52:00.125 --> 52:01.708
- Whoa!
- Are you okay, Silver?

52:01.792 --> 52:03.000
I'm fine.

52:03.750 --> 52:05.875
- You okay?
- I'm good. I'm... I'm good.

52:05.958 --> 52:07.438
He still hasn't eaten anything?

52:07.917 --> 52:08.917
No, he's, uh...

52:09.958 --> 52:12.958
still trying to leave the smallest
footprint on the planet that he can.

52:13.042 --> 52:15.333
All food production is exploitative.

52:16.583 --> 52:17.792
- Try this.
- Mmm-mmm.

52:17.875 --> 52:19.167
Come on. It's just a tomato.

52:19.250 --> 52:21.375
Ripened in ethylene gas.
Transported in trucks.

52:21.458 --> 52:25.667
I admire your conviction, Silver,
but your pallid complexion concerns me.

52:30.125 --> 52:32.167
How long have you and Okja lived together?

52:36.708 --> 52:37.917
Since she was four.

52:39.208 --> 52:41.125
Do you know
where she was being taken?

52:44.042 --> 52:49.458
To America.
To the Best Super Pig Competition.

52:49.542 --> 52:53.083
Yes. But she was being taken
somewhere else first.

52:53.167 --> 52:56.708
This is where they're really taking Okja.

52:56.792 --> 52:59.792
This underground laboratory
in Paramus, New Jersey.

53:00.833 --> 53:03.792
This is the building
where Okja was created.

53:16.167 --> 53:20.625
She thinks she was born in Arizona
and her mom in Chile.

53:20.708 --> 53:24.708
Mija. Everything you believe you know
about Okja is a lie.

53:25.333 --> 53:29.333
Okja was created in this lab.
So was her so-called mother.

53:30.583 --> 53:33.000
This is the building
where Mirando experiments

53:33.083 --> 53:35.333
on their genetically-mutated animals.

53:35.958 --> 53:38.458
Because genetic mutation is too dangerous,

53:38.542 --> 53:42.667
Mirando's been disguising it
as natural, safe and non-GMO.

53:42.750 --> 53:44.625
But that's a complete scam.

53:44.708 --> 53:48.875
Millions of GM pigs are already lining up
in front of slaughterhouses.

53:48.958 --> 53:53.417
You and the other local farmers
are just promotional devices for them.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.292
Just a picturesque backdrop.

53:59.042 --> 54:00.417
Promotion.

54:00.500 --> 54:02.792
Mirando know their consumers
would be disgusted

54:02.875 --> 54:05.083
by the idea of eating mutant, GM foods.

54:05.750 --> 54:08.042
So ten years ago, their boss,
Lucy Mirando,

54:08.125 --> 54:11.375
went inside the lab and dug around
amongst all the disfigured creatures

54:11.458 --> 54:13.958
to find the 26 prettiest ones,

54:14.042 --> 54:15.708
like your Okja.

54:15.792 --> 54:19.500
And then, big fanfare,
she sent them around the world.

54:19.583 --> 54:21.708
They've been frantically
breeding their super pigs,

54:21.792 --> 54:26.208
and soon, the supermarkets will be filled
with their flesh and organs.

54:26.292 --> 54:29.625
Dog food, hot dogs, bacon and jerky.

54:29.708 --> 54:32.250
Our plan is to put a stop
to their project.

54:32.333 --> 54:35.833
But to do so,
we need video from inside the lab,

54:35.917 --> 54:40.000
footage of the horrible atrocities
being committed against the animals.

54:40.083 --> 54:44.083
And there's a problem.
The security is impenetrable.

54:44.667 --> 54:47.417
But... there is a way.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.417
Although we will only go ahead with it
if you give us your consent.

54:52.500 --> 54:56.417
Jay. If this kid doesn't give her consent,
what, we just abandon the mission?

54:56.500 --> 54:57.750
Is that what you're saying?

54:58.333 --> 55:01.500
'Cause, brother, we've come halfway
around the world for this.

55:01.583 --> 55:04.208
- We should get this done now.
- Ugh! Don't be so selfish.

55:04.292 --> 55:07.542
This isn't about you or us,
and she is Okja's family.

55:07.625 --> 55:09.167
So of course we need her consent.

55:09.250 --> 55:12.667
I will not harm her by forcing a mission
upon her that she does not consent to.

55:12.750 --> 55:15.750
As members of the ALF,
we are obliged to honor its credo.

55:15.833 --> 55:20.167
We are going to abort because some guy
from the 1970s wrote a fucking credo?

55:20.250 --> 55:21.875
Is that what you're saying?

55:21.958 --> 55:24.083
Tradition does not make
a movement strong.

55:25.417 --> 55:27.292
We make a movement strong.

55:27.375 --> 55:30.055
If that's how you feel, call yourself
something else and not the ALF

55:30.125 --> 55:31.165
and get out of this truck.

55:32.667 --> 55:38.083
In order to expose Mirando,
we need video from inside the lab.

55:38.167 --> 55:39.958
And this is where Okja comes in.

55:41.292 --> 55:44.625
The Mirando scientists are dying to run
tests on her in their underground lab.

55:44.708 --> 55:47.750
Their star super pig.
Which is why we've made this.

55:49.500 --> 55:52.417
It looks exactly like the black box
on her ear, right?

55:53.333 --> 55:58.125
Only this one can wirelessly send
a video feed to us from inside the lab.

55:58.208 --> 56:01.250
Okja will become a hidden camera.

56:02.125 --> 56:03.208
Hey, Buddy.

56:03.292 --> 56:04.708
Hi.

56:05.333 --> 56:06.333
Okay.

56:06.917 --> 56:10.833
I'm sorry, but this was our plan.

56:12.042 --> 56:17.958
Rescue Okja, replace the black box
and let Mirando retake Okja.

56:18.042 --> 56:22.042
You want to send Okja to America?

56:22.875 --> 56:23.875
To this laboratory?

56:23.958 --> 56:25.708
Yes. But don't worry.

56:27.583 --> 56:29.042
They wouldn't dare hurt her.

56:30.042 --> 56:32.833
She needs to be perfect
for their beauty pageant.

56:32.917 --> 56:36.375
Whatever tests they do on her in there
will need to be harmless.

56:36.458 --> 56:40.417
We have a detailed plan on how to rescue
her from the event in New York City.

56:40.500 --> 56:42.625
We promise to bring her back to you.

56:45.917 --> 56:47.375
If our mission succeeds,

56:47.458 --> 56:50.750
we'll be able to shut down Mirando's
super pig project completely.

56:51.750 --> 56:56.625
And we'll be saving millions
of super pigs like Okja from death.

56:57.208 --> 56:59.708
But we won't do it without your approval.

57:00.542 --> 57:04.583
If you don't approve,
we won't do the mission.

57:07.458 --> 57:08.708
What is your decision?

57:09.750 --> 57:11.917
Take Okja back to the mountains.

57:12.000 --> 57:15.208
She agrees to the mission.

57:17.208 --> 57:18.417
Thank you.

57:18.500 --> 57:23.125
- Thank you so much.
- This is a giant leap for animal kind.

57:24.875 --> 57:25.875
Thank you.

57:26.417 --> 57:27.625
It's Ziploc.

57:50.583 --> 57:53.125
- Water won't be so bad.
- Oh, it'll be great!

57:53.208 --> 57:57.417
Move! Move! I'm gonna do it!
Holy shit, I'm gonna do it!

57:57.500 --> 57:58.917
Whoa!

58:04.917 --> 58:06.625
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

58:06.708 --> 58:08.042
Hey!

58:08.125 --> 58:10.458
Okja, I'll see you in New York.

58:11.167 --> 58:12.208
Huh?

58:12.292 --> 58:13.417
Till we meet again.

58:15.750 --> 58:20.708
Mija! Try learning English.
It opens new doors!

58:20.792 --> 58:22.333
Hey, wait! Mister!

58:32.542 --> 58:33.684
Hey, you!

58:33.708 --> 58:35.125
Grab him!

58:36.000 --> 58:38.125
He jumped! How did he do that?

58:39.292 --> 58:41.625
Hey, kid. It's dangerous.

58:41.708 --> 58:43.500
Get out of there.

58:45.333 --> 58:48.250
Hey, kid. Hey, come out!

59:03.625 --> 59:06.292
- Are you kidding me?
- It's supposed to hold.

59:06.375 --> 59:08.042
You're a fucking joke-show, mate.

59:09.208 --> 59:11.375
- Fucking awesome, epic plan, man.
- It's a Ziploc.

59:11.458 --> 59:13.750
- Fucking Ziploc, my ass.
- It was supposed to hold.

59:13.833 --> 59:14.833
Seriously?

59:14.917 --> 59:17.792
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:30.333 --> 59:32.375
<i>Last night in South Korea,</i>

59:32.458 --> 59:35.917
<i>Mirando employees were securing
their super pig when a young girl</i>

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
<i>suddenly stepped in
and tried to stop them.</i>

59:38.083 --> 59:40.458
<i>These extraordinary events began
earlier in the day</i>

59:40.542 --> 59:45.542
<i>with a highly-organized pignapping attempt
made by the Animal Liberation Front.</i>

59:45.625 --> 59:49.375
I wouldn't worry too much, Luce.
The ALF technically failed.

59:49.458 --> 59:51.138
They weren't even able
to take the product.

59:51.167 --> 59:55.000
Yeah, it's a kerfuffle over nothing.
We shouldn't make a big deal out of it.

59:55.083 --> 59:58.208
It actually means our security here
in the US is so airtight,

59:58.292 --> 01:00:00.250
they wouldn't even think
about breaking in.

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:01.976
Which is why they went all the way
to Korea.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.875
<i>The ALF hasn't been in the headlines
for a number of years,</i>

01:00:04.958 --> 01:00:08.583
<i>but they're back in the spotlight
after today's chaotic events.</i>

01:00:08.833 --> 01:00:11.750
Well, the good news is that the pig
is on its way to New York now.

01:00:11.833 --> 01:00:15.583
Right. And the Best Super Pig Fest
will continue as planned.

01:00:15.667 --> 01:00:19.375
<i>Significant damage to Mirando's
stock price seems inevitable.</i>

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:22.083
<i>Yeah. Mirando is completely fucked.</i>

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:25.125
<i>Mirando.
That's your current employer, correct?</i>

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:27.583
<i>Yup. But I don't care.</i>

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.875
<i>They fucked, not me. They fucked up.</i>

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.250
I know what they're calling me,
those ALF fuckers.

01:00:39.958 --> 01:00:41.750
They're calling me a psychopath.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:45.667
You're not a psychopath.

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:48.167
They're the psychopaths.
Right, Ms. Mirando?

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:50.542
They're narcissists.

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.083
Do narcissists wear balaclavas?

01:00:55.167 --> 01:00:59.000
Crazy radicals have been
calling us psychopaths since the '60s.

01:00:59.083 --> 01:01:00.750
"You're a psychopath.

01:01:00.833 --> 01:01:04.667
Your sister was a psychopath.
Your father was a psychopath."

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:08.750
Well, Daddy was a psychopath, Frank.
I mean, that's hardly an unfair slur.

01:01:11.125 --> 01:01:12.833
"What did you do in the war, Daddy?"

01:01:13.417 --> 01:01:16.417
"I manufactured the napalm
that made everybody's skin fall off."

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:21.625
And this is a man
who called his child an idiot loser.

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:27.417
Well, in fairness to your father,
when he called you an idiot loser,

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:29.420
you had just signed up
for a course in California

01:01:29.458 --> 01:01:31.750
called "Unleash Your Calling."

01:01:31.833 --> 01:01:34.875
At a highly-respected institute
for the advancement of human potential

01:01:34.958 --> 01:01:36.917
where many a forward-looking CEO go.

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.083
And you know what I was doing
while I was at the institute?

01:01:40.167 --> 01:01:45.042
I was visualizing new
and better ways of doing business.

01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:48.125
While my sister was CEO...
What was the name of that lake?

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:49.417
Moose Lake.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.333
Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO,

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:55.792
dumping so much toxic waste
into Moose Lake that it exploded...

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:58.708
The only lake ever to explode.
Well done, Nancy.

01:01:58.792 --> 01:02:05.583
I was visualizing ways of turning the most
hated agrochemical company in the world

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:09.625
into the most likable
miracle pig-rearing company.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:11.708
And it's working! It's working!

01:02:11.792 --> 01:02:15.125
It was working until last night.

01:02:15.208 --> 01:02:17.000
Until six hours ago.

01:02:17.583 --> 01:02:23.375
The synthesis of old Mirando
and new Mirando was impeccable.

01:02:24.875 --> 01:02:28.000
I took nature and science,

01:02:28.917 --> 01:02:30.667
and I synthesized.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:33.083
And everyone loved it.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:37.292
You remember what the <i>New York Times</i>
said about our super pigs?

01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:39.208
"Intriguing," right?

01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:42.917
"Lucy Mirando is pulling off
the impossible.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.500
She is making us fall in love
with a creature

01:02:45.583 --> 01:02:47.500
that we are already looking forward
to eating."

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:51.250
I mean, these are journalists
who never write about pigs.

01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:54.667
They never write about pigs!
They wrote about our pigs.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:56.917
Ten years in planning!

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.667
On the cusp of a product launch
that will feed millions!

01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:02.292
And what happens?

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:05.625
We get tangled up in this terrorism thing,

01:03:05.708 --> 01:03:08.917
and somehow we end up being
the ones who look bad.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.625
We don't look too bad.

01:03:11.708 --> 01:03:15.125
- We don't? Open that thing!
- Yup.

01:03:17.583 --> 01:03:19.292
No, rewind. Rewind.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:22.458
Rewind!

01:03:23.292 --> 01:03:24.292
Okay, play.

01:03:25.292 --> 01:03:27.768
<i>The girl was later revealed
to be the granddaughter</i>

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:30.750
<i>of a local farmer selected
by Mirando CEO...</i>

01:03:30.833 --> 01:03:32.125
Pause, there.

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:34.000
That's it.

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:36.042
That's the image.

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.625
That is the image
that is gonna destroy us.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.625
Who are those morons?

01:03:42.708 --> 01:03:44.250
Find out and fire them.

01:03:46.125 --> 01:03:47.125
Sure.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:50.000
Abusing that adorable girl.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:53.667
And in the uniforms
that I personally designed myself.

01:03:54.667 --> 01:03:57.208
And shoving her best friend onto a truck.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.000
That's gonna kill us.

01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.875
Right there. That's it.

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:11.875
That image. We're dead.

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:53.000
Lucy, may I ask you a question?

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:58.000
The girl. You're thinking of bringing her
to New York, aren't you?

01:04:58.917 --> 01:05:00.417
I was about to say that!

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Yes, of course.

01:05:02.583 --> 01:05:05.042
You'll invite her
to The Best Super Pig Festival and...

01:05:05.708 --> 01:05:07.208
A moving reunion!

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:11.250
The best super pig and the adorable
farmer girl forced apart

01:05:11.333 --> 01:05:13.625
and somehow brought together on our stage.

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:14.958
Brilliant, Lucy.

01:05:15.042 --> 01:05:18.292
An emotional reunion,
and then they leave the stage together.

01:05:18.375 --> 01:05:20.583
Hand in hand. Hand in trotter.

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.667
She can be the new face
of the Mirando Corporation.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.333
She can be the embodiment
of the Mirando ideal.

01:05:26.417 --> 01:05:28.792
She's young, she's pretty, she's female.

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:32.000
She's eco-friendly and she's global!
She's a godsend!

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:34.333
Are you writing this down?

01:05:34.417 --> 01:05:35.417
Hey!

01:05:39.042 --> 01:05:41.542
She's not the face
of the Mirando Corporation. I am.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.667
You don't even know
if she can do anything but cry.

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:48.375
Whereas I am loved...

01:05:50.542 --> 01:05:52.042
all over the world.

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:55.792
Could you sit down and shut
the fucking squeaking and whining?

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:03.417
You know...

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:10.583
you are forcing me...

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.583
I'm forcing you to do what?

01:06:16.333 --> 01:06:18.833
To examine my options.

01:06:18.917 --> 01:06:21.000
Oh, really? Okay.

01:06:21.083 --> 01:06:23.000
Go ahead. Examine them.

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:26.625
Are you examining them now?
Have you finished examining them?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.667
Sit. You're a deadbeat.

01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:32.875
Your ratings are shit. Epic fail.

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:36.167
Jennifer, get her a first class ticket.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:39.333
Get her a passport. She probably
hasn't got a passport. Get her a visa.

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:41.708
We'll pay for all the damage
the super pig did in Korea.

01:06:41.792 --> 01:06:42.958
Get an attorney on that.

01:06:43.042 --> 01:06:46.667
Don't force an image on her,
like Benetton did with those Asian models.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.542
Oh, no. I have a much better idea.

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:59.292
Okay, we got it all figured out.
We got a strategy. We got a plan.

01:06:59.375 --> 01:07:01.083
We're gonna think of it like a love story.

01:07:01.167 --> 01:07:03.917
<i>That's what we're gonna do.
Hand those bits of paper out quickly.</i>

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.160
<i>We got a little girl
running around the city all alone.</i>

01:07:06.208 --> 01:07:07.917
<i>We've got a big, big giant pig.</i>

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.958
<i>We gotta bring them back together
because they miss each other.</i>

01:07:11.042 --> 01:07:12.143
<i>Now they go to New York City.</i>

01:07:12.167 --> 01:07:14.333
Look at her, so sweet. Cute.
Totally gorgeous.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:15.917
Totally sexy. Hot, tiny, perfect.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:20.958
At this rate,
she'll be doing Mirando commercials.

01:07:21.042 --> 01:07:23.417
- It's very likely!
- Thank you!

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.958
- Mija!
- Mija.

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:27.208
Everything is worked out!
Don't worry about a thing.

01:07:27.292 --> 01:07:29.458
Let's take a photo
for our company Twitter.

01:07:29.542 --> 01:07:30.625
Hold this.

01:07:33.833 --> 01:07:35.458
Get Okja on the phone now!

01:07:35.542 --> 01:07:36.917
I want to know how she's doing.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.542
On the phone? With a pig?

01:07:38.625 --> 01:07:41.101
And we gotta tell this
to everybody in New York City!

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:44.208
On Instagram, on YouTube, on Tumblr,
on Facebook, on Twitter.

01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:46.458
Okja. Okja, the giant pig.
She's, like, this big.

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:48.062
She's, like, oh, my God. She's bigger.

01:07:48.125 --> 01:07:49.750
Yeah, she's got one big, giant nipple.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:52.625
Hasn't Okja landed yet?

01:07:52.708 --> 01:07:54.542
Can we phone her now?

01:07:54.625 --> 01:07:56.500
Let's take a picture first, then call her.

01:07:56.583 --> 01:07:58.250
- Really?
- Of course.

01:08:02.542 --> 01:08:08.292
In the plane…
If you get airsick…

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:11.250
chew the end of this.

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.708
Like this, okay?

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:15.375
Look at me.

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.167
Mija. Take this.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:32.417
CONGRATULATIONS!
BEST SUPER PIG COMPETITION

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:43.750
ENGLISH FOR BEGINNERS

01:09:01.875 --> 01:09:03.957
Just what I need!

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:12.707
Hey, Nance.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:17.375
How's London? Is that rain?
That can't be good for the golf.

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:19.207
<i>Just letting you know I'm thinking of you.</i>

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:20.667
<i>You're having a moment, I see.</i>

01:09:20.750 --> 01:09:24.750
Yes, things are going super well.
It's all a massive success.

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:26.042
<i>Really?</i>

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:29.917
<i>They keep showing very
unflattering pictures of you in the press.</i>

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.792
<i>Those ones of you as a fat child
on Daddy's knee.</i>

01:09:33.875 --> 01:09:35.500
<i>Such nasty remarks.</i>

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.542
<i>All eyes are on you, aren't they,
squeaky clean icon?</i>

01:09:41.167 --> 01:09:43.750
<i>I've sent you a reminder of the true face</i>

01:09:43.832 --> 01:09:47.792
<i>of the most powerful CEO
Mirando has ever had.</i>

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:49.207
<i>You go, girl.</i>

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.417
Okay. Signal's good.

01:10:06.083 --> 01:10:07.500
We're seeing what Okja's seeing.

01:10:10.917 --> 01:10:12.583
Enjoy this moment.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:15.333
Because soon the whole world
will know what we know.

01:10:15.917 --> 01:10:19.000
Oh, my God, Jay.
We're about to change everything.

01:10:19.083 --> 01:10:21.042
With my shiny antennae.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:23.125
I'll put some distance
between us and them.

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:25.833
We have to test
how far the signal reaches.

01:10:48.958 --> 01:10:52.583
Oh, man. We're really cooking now.

01:10:52.667 --> 01:10:54.042
- There she goes.
- Wow.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:56.375
- Okja gets to see everything.
- Quiet.

01:10:56.958 --> 01:10:59.583
This is historical. It's historical.
This is history.

01:11:14.833 --> 01:11:17.375
Okja!

01:11:22.125 --> 01:11:25.125
Hi! Ah!

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:27.250
Ah!

01:11:28.292 --> 01:11:29.625
We're reunited.

01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:33.458
In this wretched laboratory, no less.

01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:36.083
Someone you're going to find very special.

01:11:36.167 --> 01:11:38.792
Here is Alfonso!

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:41.583
Where is he?

01:11:41.667 --> 01:11:44.833
I got a special treat
for Lucy's star super pig.

01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:48.292
Hey! Chop, chop!

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:54.750
Let me introduce you to someone.

01:11:54.833 --> 01:11:57.167
Alfonso, Okja!

01:11:57.250 --> 01:12:02.458
Okja, Alfonso! Your boyfriend.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:04.417
It's all good.

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.792
- Come on.
- Are we recording?

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:12.875
Yeah.

01:12:21.958 --> 01:12:23.333
Oh, my God.

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:38.917
We should never have sent her there.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.667
Can you turn it off, please?

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.250
No.

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:47.125
No, we need to record this.
We need to show this.

01:12:47.958 --> 01:12:49.625
At least turn the volume down.

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.708
- We knowingly sent her to that hellhole.
- No, we didn't.

01:12:54.792 --> 01:12:56.875
We didn't know
they were gonna do this to her.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:59.583
We didn't know they were gonna
put her through this mating.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:00.792
We suspected!

01:13:01.833 --> 01:13:03.750
Come on, we all suspected.

01:13:04.833 --> 01:13:06.667
Turn it off!

01:13:15.250 --> 01:13:16.708
I know it's painful.

01:13:18.292 --> 01:13:19.750
But we can't be weak.

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:20.833
That's right.

01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:24.500
This is why we need to stay focused.

01:13:24.583 --> 01:13:26.417
This is why we need
to stick to the mission.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.167
The little girl trusted us with Okja.
We have to respect her bravery.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:31.958
She never agreed to send Okja.

01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:34.958
What'd you just say?

01:13:38.833 --> 01:13:40.250
She was in our truck.

01:13:41.458 --> 01:13:43.667
She said...

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:46.667
"I wanna take Okja back
to the mountains."

01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:49.583
I lied.

01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:54.833
- God.
- Why did you lie?

01:13:56.042 --> 01:13:58.917
I don't know.
In that moment, it's just... I couldn't...

01:14:00.542 --> 01:14:02.125
I couldn't stop the mission.

01:14:02.917 --> 01:14:06.042
You know, this is...
this is the coolest mission ever.

01:14:06.125 --> 01:14:08.333
- I have all this stuff and...
- Hey, K... K.

01:14:10.500 --> 01:14:11.875
It's okay.

01:14:15.833 --> 01:14:17.625
I hold you dear to my heart,

01:14:17.708 --> 01:14:20.167
but you have dishonored
the 40-year history

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:23.708
and meaningful legacy
of the Animal Liberation Front.

01:14:23.792 --> 01:14:28.417
You have betrayed the great minds
and brave fighters that have preceded you.

01:14:29.792 --> 01:14:31.125
Never mistranslate.

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:35.458
Translation is sacred.

01:14:38.542 --> 01:14:39.750
From this moment on...

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:45.042
you are no longer a member of the ALF.
You are permanently banned.

01:14:47.042 --> 01:14:48.042
Get out.

01:14:49.458 --> 01:14:50.583
However...

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.917
since it is vital that we continue
with our mission...

01:14:55.625 --> 01:14:58.458
we will return your equipment to you
after its completion.

01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:02.000
Consider this your final contribution
to the ALF.

01:15:11.625 --> 01:15:13.583
Ah, shit.

01:15:13.917 --> 01:15:15.500
Oh, my God.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:20.417
You want some?

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:30.375
It'll make you feel better.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:52.250
This is an unspeakable place.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:57.917
I know. I know.

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.917
There are worse rooms out there.

01:16:07.333 --> 01:16:10.917
Lucy Mirando says
I'm not supposed to harm you in here.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.125
Well, at least not visibly.

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:17.292
She wants you perfect
for her big telecast!

01:16:18.667 --> 01:16:19.667
But...

01:16:22.875 --> 01:16:26.917
when a woman humiliates a man

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.333
in front of his own colleagues,

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:33.708
a man is inclined
to make his own decisions.

01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.875
This is nothing, really.

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:45.208
It's used on beef. I mean, live cows.

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.417
To check their marbling.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.208
Hi, Dr. Johnny. Is Okja with you?

01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:57.208
Yes!

01:16:57.292 --> 01:17:00.708
<i>Our precious farmer princess insists
that she speaks to her on the phone.</i>

01:17:00.792 --> 01:17:01.792
What?

01:17:02.292 --> 01:17:05.252
Whatever. She says you should lift
her ear and put the receiver underneath.

01:17:05.625 --> 01:17:08.042
- You're on speakerphone!
- Okja!

01:17:08.125 --> 01:17:09.292
<i>Okja!</i>

01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:13.250
<i>Okja! Are you okay?</i>

01:17:13.333 --> 01:17:15.542
Okja! Okja! What did you say?

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:16.875
I can't hear you!

01:17:16.958 --> 01:17:19.500
<i>Okja! Okja!</i>

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:21.167
<i>Okja! Are you okay?</i>

01:17:43.833 --> 01:17:45.542
Bang! Sirloin.

01:17:49.542 --> 01:17:50.542
Ooh!

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:52.125
The shank.

01:17:53.792 --> 01:17:57.000
Don't worry. You won't die.

01:17:58.167 --> 01:18:00.458
We're just gonna take some of your meat.

01:18:01.792 --> 01:18:05.708
And of course, I'm not gonna eat any.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:08.833
We have tasters for that.

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:13.292
They're a bunch of half-wit,
degenerate fucktards!

01:18:17.958 --> 01:18:22.125
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna poke you in five places.

01:18:22.708 --> 01:18:26.167
And I'm sorry. It's gonna hurt.

01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:29.458
I shouldn't be here.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:37.083
I'm an animal lover.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:40.625
Everybody knows that about me!

01:18:55.583 --> 01:18:56.583
Tasty.

01:18:58.708 --> 01:18:59.958
Fuck, yeah.

01:19:00.042 --> 01:19:04.542
That was the best I've ever had.
The best of the best.

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:15.792
<i>Today Mirando presents to you
our super gourmet sausage.</i>

01:19:16.417 --> 01:19:19.292
<i>Juicy like you've never tasted before.</i>

01:19:19.917 --> 01:19:23.500
<i>An exquisite taste
with a very affordable price!</i>

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:29.000
<i>Made fresh from our naturally-grown,
Grade A super pigs.</i>

01:19:29.083 --> 01:19:32.000
<i>Very healthy! Come and try!</i>

01:19:32.083 --> 01:19:33.309
Pink streamers, pink fireworks.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:34.976
Lucy's gonna be happy.
I'm gonna get my bonus.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.708
I'm gonna be...
What the hell is this?

01:19:36.792 --> 01:19:39.625
That's Lucy's autograph.
"Designed by Lucy Mirando."

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.125
Oh! She can't get enough of herself,
can she?

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:45.333
Hey! Oh, how's everyone doing?

01:19:45.417 --> 01:19:47.917
Still with this thing.
It looks super tacky.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.080
Don't touch it!

01:19:49.125 --> 01:19:50.226
Don't touch it.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.375
Okay, okay. The fanny pack is fine.

01:19:53.042 --> 01:19:54.976
I think she understands some English.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.542
So we should be careful what we say.

01:19:56.625 --> 01:19:59.042
Yes, yes, everything is fine.

01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:01.000
But you have to wear this.

01:20:01.083 --> 01:20:05.500
Oh, it's a special edition,
custom-made, just for you.

01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:08.625
Look. The CEO even autographed it.

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:10.083
Boop! Totally rad, right?

01:20:10.167 --> 01:20:11.667
Wow. Hmm?

01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:12.958
Now, let's put it on.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.375
Not until I see Okja.

01:20:15.958 --> 01:20:19.417
Mija... Oh!
Think about how dramatic it will be.

01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:22.417
Okja...
Okja doesn't even know you're here.

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:26.000
If you show up on stage
without telling her,

01:20:26.083 --> 01:20:28.042
it'll be such a great surprise.

01:20:28.625 --> 01:20:30.083
You know? Surprise?

01:20:30.167 --> 01:20:31.625
I don't care about that.

01:20:31.708 --> 01:20:34.500
I want to see Okja first.
Or I won't cooperate.

01:20:35.292 --> 01:20:37.042
- Mija...
- She said no.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:40.625
Mija. Mija, I don't think
you understand this situation.

01:20:42.542 --> 01:20:45.417
No, no, no.
We are the ones who have Okja. Okay?

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:47.792
We are doing you a favor.
Do you get it now?

01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:52.375
Yep, yep, yep.
You want to go back home with Okja, right?

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.625
Then do as you're told.

01:20:54.708 --> 01:20:58.375
Otherwise,
this is what will happen to Okja.

01:21:00.875 --> 01:21:01.875
Put it on.

01:21:03.667 --> 01:21:05.500
The turnout's looking good,
don't you think?

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:08.303
- Lucy must be thrilled.
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:09.583
All eyes on her.

01:21:09.667 --> 01:21:11.307
Thinks it's her own fashion show.

01:21:18.375 --> 01:21:19.375
Mija.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:22.417
It's me.

01:21:23.708 --> 01:21:24.708
Jay.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.542
Oh, shut up!

01:23:39.542 --> 01:23:42.042
Oh, man, this is so good, man.
You gotta try this.

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:43.458
It's actually really good.

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:51.625
Good day, all. Thank you very much.

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:54.875
These are for you.

01:23:54.958 --> 01:23:56.583
Oh! Thanks, Frank.

01:23:58.292 --> 01:24:01.000
Ten years.
An extraordinary accomplishment.

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:04.833
Ten years, finally coming to fruition.

01:24:06.083 --> 01:24:08.792
You have to try one of these.
They're completely delicious.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.000
Delicious.

01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:21.667
Beautiful.

01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:23.583
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:24.917
Mmm.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.250
Mmm.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:37.625
Such a shame we had to tell
all those little white lies.

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:45.375
It's not our fault that the consumers
are so paranoid about GM foods.

01:24:52.167 --> 01:24:53.917
These are really beautiful.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.542
Oh!

01:24:55.625 --> 01:24:58.417
Your taste is as impeccable as always.

01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.625
Oh.

01:25:00.292 --> 01:25:02.500
Well, the flowers aren't actually from me.

01:25:02.583 --> 01:25:03.583
Oh?

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:07.375
- Are they from Nancy?
- Yes.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.708
Nancy's here. Not in London.

01:25:10.833 --> 01:25:12.333
She's here? In New York?

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:14.708
Fuck Nancy.

01:25:15.417 --> 01:25:17.875
- She's been here a while.
- I told you to keep her away!

01:25:17.958 --> 01:25:19.583
She frightens people!

01:25:20.167 --> 01:25:21.708
You frighten people, too, Lucy.

01:25:24.042 --> 01:25:27.375
Yeah, but she really frightens people.
She reminds them of Daddy.

01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.833
This is mine. This is my project.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:42.000
She just wants to support you
on your special day.

01:25:43.625 --> 01:25:44.792
Is she watching me?

01:25:50.792 --> 01:25:52.958
Johnny's in the house!
Johnny's in the house!

01:25:53.542 --> 01:25:55.333
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.667
- Yes!
- We love you, Johnny!

01:26:02.208 --> 01:26:03.375
Yeah!

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.875
Whoo, whoo, whoo!

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:08.250
Johnny!

01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:14.667
Dr. Johnny's...

01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:17.000
Magical Animals!

01:26:18.417 --> 01:26:22.542
Everybody knows
Dr. Johnny can't stand anything boring!

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.292
No!

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:28.375
- Have I ever given you a boring show?
- No!

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:32.167
Who's ready?

01:26:40.292 --> 01:26:45.750
Ten years ago,
26 farmers from lands far away

01:26:45.833 --> 01:26:49.042
were each given a magical super piglet.

01:26:49.958 --> 01:26:53.458
This year, I met these wonderful people,

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:57.083
to decide which super piglet
would have the honor of being invited

01:26:57.167 --> 01:26:59.167
to this prestigious occasion.

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.250
Are you ready to meet
the winner of this contest?

01:27:04.333 --> 01:27:06.375
Yeah!

01:27:06.458 --> 01:27:10.000
The best super pig
on the face of the Earth?

01:27:10.083 --> 01:27:11.667
Yeah!

01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:17.250
Are you ready?

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:20.000
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna
have to meet somebody else first.

01:27:20.083 --> 01:27:21.875
Isn't that the way it always is?

01:27:21.958 --> 01:27:24.038
Before you meet the talent,
you gotta meet the suits.

01:27:24.958 --> 01:27:26.833
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

01:27:28.958 --> 01:27:31.417
She is an amazing little lady...

01:27:32.250 --> 01:27:37.375
and she happens to be the brain
behind this entire super pig project!

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:42.458
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

01:27:42.542 --> 01:27:45.208
for the one, the only,

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:48.250
Lucy Mirando!

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:02.792
"Lucy Mirando!"

01:28:04.792 --> 01:28:05.792
Fucking idiot.

01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:08.208
You look amazing!

01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:12.958
Oh, Johnny.

01:28:13.042 --> 01:28:17.083
You're skating on thin ice.
Watch out you don't fall in and drown.

01:28:17.167 --> 01:28:19.375
Don't worry.
I'm not here to put you to sleep

01:28:19.458 --> 01:28:22.500
with some corporate speech
like my boring sister might have.

01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:25.000
Yeah, there it is!

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.833
Go on, Lucy!

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.167
Lucy, we love you!

01:28:30.417 --> 01:28:35.583
No. I'm here to introduce you
to a real superstar.

01:28:36.292 --> 01:28:40.667
Maybe you've already seen her on YouTube,
enjoying her little shopping spree

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:43.583
in that underground mall in Seoul!

01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:47.708
So let's all welcome
an extraordinary little girl.

01:28:47.792 --> 01:28:51.542
A local farmer
who raised her beloved super pig

01:28:51.625 --> 01:28:54.625
in wild and beautiful nature.

01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:59.208
The fearless pig rider
from across the globe!

01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:00.500
Please welcome...

01:29:01.458 --> 01:29:02.458
Mija!

01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:17.333
And here she is! Our ultimate super pig!

01:29:17.417 --> 01:29:18.875
Okja!

01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:23.792
Okja! Okja!

01:30:27.708 --> 01:30:29.792
Hey, get her off the stage!

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000
Okja!

01:30:38.417 --> 01:30:40.083
Come on. Now!

01:30:40.167 --> 01:30:42.292
Good. Here's Johnny!

01:30:48.167 --> 01:30:49.625
Mija!

01:30:51.583 --> 01:30:52.875
Don't look back.

01:30:57.458 --> 01:30:58.667
Just look at me.

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:03.083
Turn it off! Turn it... Kill the screen!

01:31:03.167 --> 01:31:05.833
<i>I'm an animal lover.</i>

01:31:07.833 --> 01:31:08.833
Stop it!

01:31:13.458 --> 01:31:14.458
Go!

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:21.625
Save that pig!
Save that pig! Save that pig!

01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:24.417
No! No, no, no! No! No!

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.750
I promise... No, I pledge,
to learn everything I can,

01:31:31.833 --> 01:31:33.875
everything from this situation...

01:31:38.250 --> 01:31:40.351
For more details and shocking proof

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:43.500
of Mirando's crimes
against humanity and animals,

01:31:43.583 --> 01:31:47.000
go to YouTube and search
"Mirando is fucked."

01:31:47.083 --> 01:31:49.667
That's right, folks. Go to YouTube now

01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:55.250
and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."

01:31:55.958 --> 01:31:56.958
Fucked!

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.667
I don't think we have a choice, Nancy.

01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:13.208
You have to go out there.

01:32:14.833 --> 01:32:16.083
You don't say.

01:32:19.333 --> 01:32:21.083
What a clusterfuck.

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:24.375
Let's get private security in there.

01:32:25.917 --> 01:32:26.792
Black Chalk.

01:32:26.875 --> 01:32:29.125
We're on good terms
with the NYPD, correct?

01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:30.500
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

01:32:30.583 --> 01:32:32.000
<i>We have an arrangement.</i>

01:32:38.250 --> 01:32:39.500
Okja! No!

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.625
Black Chalk!

01:33:47.792 --> 01:33:50.032
- Let's go. Come on!
- You okay?

01:33:52.750 --> 01:33:55.083
- Blond! Let's move!
- Go, go, go!

01:33:57.083 --> 01:33:58.167
Come here, come here.

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:01.458
Red, let's go.

01:34:01.542 --> 01:34:02.542
Move!

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:06.976
- Where's the truck?
- Up to the right!

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.542
More Black Chalk! Hurry!

01:34:08.792 --> 01:34:09.875
Take 'em down!

01:34:27.167 --> 01:34:29.000
Move! Move!

01:34:30.292 --> 01:34:31.292
Go!

01:35:59.083 --> 01:36:03.625
Well, good luck
with clearing up my mess, twinny.

01:36:06.292 --> 01:36:09.833
Well, for a while back then,
you forgot you were such a loser.

01:36:24.042 --> 01:36:26.958
I mean, Daddy was a terrible man.

01:36:28.292 --> 01:36:29.625
He was a real horror.

01:36:31.875 --> 01:36:35.042
But, by God, did he know about business.

01:36:41.333 --> 01:36:43.917
Don't worry about your apology speech,
twinny.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.250
I'll pretend to be you
in front of the press.

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:48.792
Ah! The police.

01:36:49.458 --> 01:36:52.138
You'll understand that I will be
instructing our corporate attorneys

01:36:52.208 --> 01:36:54.333
not to assist you in any way.

01:36:54.417 --> 01:36:55.417
Frank.

01:36:58.292 --> 01:37:01.875
- Zero delay on the distribution plan.
- Of course.

01:37:01.958 --> 01:37:05.000
Scrap Lucy's precious
promotional marketing crap.

01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:08.875
- Tell everyone ASAP.
- Definitely.

01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:11.417
We already have FDA approval, correct?

01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:15.333
Yes, we do. But I'm not sure
how the customers will react after today.

01:37:15.417 --> 01:37:17.042
If it's cheap, they'll eat it.

01:37:17.125 --> 01:37:19.792
I guarantee early sales will be strong.

01:37:20.375 --> 01:37:22.792
Shut down the lab as already discussed.

01:37:22.875 --> 01:37:25.417
We'll visit the production facility
later tonight.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:27.583
Get all the execs there,
even the ones on vacation.

01:37:27.667 --> 01:37:29.125
Put all the pigs into production.

01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:31.333
Even the best super pig?

01:37:31.417 --> 01:37:33.458
Every last one of them.

01:37:44.167 --> 01:37:47.125
- You okay?
- K...

01:37:47.208 --> 01:37:48.458
What are you doing?

01:37:55.333 --> 01:37:56.375
Okja...

01:37:57.458 --> 01:37:58.667
We need to hurry.

01:38:04.417 --> 01:38:06.417
Look, I'm just saying that
if I call you one time,

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.768
I like for you to pick up the first time,
know what I mean?

01:38:08.792 --> 01:38:11.958
Like, I have a friend here
who's incredibly sick.

01:38:13.917 --> 01:38:16.375
Are you even certified?
Do you know what you're doing?

01:38:17.542 --> 01:38:19.917
The guy's bleeding out!
Do you know what you're doing?

01:38:38.125 --> 01:38:40.917
Mija, are you okay?

01:38:48.708 --> 01:38:50.250
She wants to know where we're going.

01:38:54.875 --> 01:38:55.958
We're going to Okja.

01:38:56.667 --> 01:38:57.667
Okja?

01:38:59.708 --> 01:39:03.708
Yes, but you should know
the situation is not good.

01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.458
What is it?

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:09.833
I didn't... There is no other way.

01:39:14.167 --> 01:39:16.333
I wish you didn't have to see this.

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.375
Just tell me where she is!

01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.958
We are going to need your help. Mija...

01:39:32.375 --> 01:39:33.625
Ah!

01:39:47.333 --> 01:39:48.542
Okja.

01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:49.792
Wait! Mija!

01:39:54.708 --> 01:39:56.417
Okja!

01:39:56.500 --> 01:39:58.000
Okja!

01:39:58.083 --> 01:40:01.583
- Okja! Okja!
- Okja!

01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:04.250
- Okja!
- Okja!

01:40:04.333 --> 01:40:05.583
Okja!

01:40:05.667 --> 01:40:07.833
- Okja!
- Okja!

01:40:08.292 --> 01:40:10.208
Okja!

01:40:10.292 --> 01:40:11.500
- Okja!
- Okja!

01:40:11.583 --> 01:40:14.792
Emergency, emergency.
We have intruders in section A-24!

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:15.875
Come on.

01:40:16.625 --> 01:40:17.667
I'm so sorry.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:21.250
This is nonlethal.
This is a nonlethal choke hold, okay?

01:40:21.333 --> 01:40:24.750
All right, you're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine. Okay?

01:40:25.292 --> 01:40:28.833
Six minutes, 45 seconds
before Black Chalk arrive!

01:40:30.208 --> 01:40:31.833
This is our last chance.

01:40:41.042 --> 01:40:43.458
- Okja!
- Okja!

01:40:44.500 --> 01:40:46.167
Okja!

01:40:49.625 --> 01:40:50.917
Okja!

01:40:54.250 --> 01:40:56.333
No! Don't go inside!

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:46.500
Hey!

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:03.042
Okja.

01:43:05.833 --> 01:43:06.833
Okja!

01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:08.583
No!

01:43:15.833 --> 01:43:17.917
- Okja...
- Wait.

01:43:23.792 --> 01:43:26.059
- This what caused the alarm?
- I believe so.

01:43:26.083 --> 01:43:29.208
I'm flummoxed that security is so lax
as to allow a bunch of hooligans

01:43:29.292 --> 01:43:31.208
to delay the production line,
even for a second.

01:43:31.292 --> 01:43:34.750
It won't happen again. Please note
that Black Chalk was here exactly on time.

01:43:34.833 --> 01:43:37.833
- No, guys, guys, this is...
- Please, don't touch her!

01:43:37.917 --> 01:43:40.667
- Sir! Sir, put the gun down. It's okay.
- Stop! Less violence!

01:43:40.750 --> 01:43:41.917
No! No violence!

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.500
Isn't this Lucy's beloved
fearless pig rider?

01:43:45.583 --> 01:43:49.875
She is. And that's our best super pig.

01:43:49.958 --> 01:43:51.292
Well, what's the hiccup?

01:43:52.208 --> 01:43:53.708
Why is it still alive?

01:43:54.375 --> 01:43:56.042
Why you want to kill Okja?

01:43:56.792 --> 01:43:58.958
Well, we can only sell the dead ones.

01:44:00.625 --> 01:44:03.917
I wanna go home with Okja.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.583
No, it's my property.

01:44:06.667 --> 01:44:10.042
- You're a fucking psychopath.
- You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:44:10.125 --> 01:44:13.208
Fuck off! We're extremely proud
of our achievements.

01:44:13.292 --> 01:44:15.167
We're very hardworking businesspeople.

01:44:15.250 --> 01:44:18.208
We do deals,
and these are the deals we do.

01:44:18.958 --> 01:44:22.083
This is the tenderloin
for the sophisticated restaurants.

01:44:22.167 --> 01:44:25.375
The Mexicans love the feet.
I know. Go figure!

01:44:25.458 --> 01:44:30.792
We all love the face and the anus,
as American as apple pie! Hot dogs.

01:44:30.875 --> 01:44:34.458
It's all edible.
All edible, except the squeal.

01:44:36.250 --> 01:44:39.958
- So you're the other Mirando.
- And you are?

01:44:41.250 --> 01:44:43.583
- Let Mija and Okja go.
- Why?

01:44:44.792 --> 01:44:46.625
You already have a shitload of money.

01:44:47.208 --> 01:44:49.625
- Please.
- This is business.

01:44:49.708 --> 01:44:53.625
Hey, Nancy!
I hold all creatures dear to my heart,

01:44:53.708 --> 01:44:56.250
but you are crying out to be an exception.

01:44:57.083 --> 01:44:58.083
Mija!

01:44:58.625 --> 01:45:00.125
Oh, okay.

01:45:03.125 --> 01:45:04.417
<i>Terminálo.</i>

01:45:05.833 --> 01:45:07.083
No, wait!

01:45:18.583 --> 01:45:21.708
I want to buy Okja... alive.

01:45:58.542 --> 01:45:59.958
Hmm.

01:46:00.042 --> 01:46:01.250
Very nice.

01:46:02.792 --> 01:46:04.167
We have a deal.

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:06.083
This thing is worth a lot of money.

01:46:06.167 --> 01:46:09.000
Make sure our customer
and her purchase get home safely.

01:46:09.083 --> 01:46:12.917
Our first ever Mirando super pig sale.
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:14.625
<i>Libéralo.</i>

01:49:48.167 --> 01:49:49.542
Did you pick a lot?

01:49:49.625 --> 01:49:50.625
Yes.

01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.083
Don't scare the chickens.

01:59:24.292 --> 01:59:27.208
It's gonna be big.
Record-breaking.

01:59:28.625 --> 01:59:31.333
Lot of folks flying in
from Midwest and Canada.

01:59:31.417 --> 01:59:32.417
Good.

01:59:33.458 --> 01:59:35.167
Oh, let me introduce you to a new member.

01:59:35.250 --> 01:59:36.250
Hey.

01:59:38.667 --> 01:59:41.875
He runs Mirandoisfucked.com.
Just got in from Seoul.

01:59:41.958 --> 01:59:43.792
- Hi. What's your name?
- Red.

01:59:43.875 --> 01:59:46.000
Red. Oh, it's because of your hair?

01:59:46.083 --> 01:59:48.792
Hey. Quit bugging her.

01:59:50.958 --> 01:59:52.199
He's a chatty one.

01:59:52.250 --> 01:59:54.167
I'm assuming Mirando bigwigs
will be there?

01:59:54.833 --> 01:59:57.042
- Of course.
- Mirandoisfucked.com.

01:59:57.125 --> 01:59:59.250
Including Nancy Mirando.

02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:09.750
There it is.
