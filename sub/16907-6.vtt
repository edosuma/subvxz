00:02.001 --> 00:03.754
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

00:03.921 --> 00:05.047
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

00:05.214 --> 00:08.639
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

00:08.926 --> 00:11.145
<i>Today, I fight that war on two fronts.</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:13.601
<i>By day, I lead Star City as its mayor.</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:15.732
<i>But by night, I am someone else.</i>

00:15.891 --> 00:17.939
<i>I am something else.</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:20.320
<i>I am the Green Arrow.</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.073
Previously on Arrow...

00:23.232 --> 00:25.075
Susan Williams.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

00:25.234 --> 00:28.158
<i>Unfortunately, Mayor Queen
doesn't seem to have the first clue</i>

00:28.320 --> 00:30.118
<i>of what's going on
within his own administration.</i>

00:30.280 --> 00:32.658
You give me one month with no attacks.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.952
- Let me show you what I can do.
- One month.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.415
- What's this?
- My personal cell.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.252
- Why would I need that?
- I think you can figure it out.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.797
- What are you doing in Russia?
- I'm here to kill Konstantin Kovar.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.837
Tell me if you can get me close to him.

00:45.003 --> 00:47.131
All right. But the only way will kill you.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.766
<i>I have no family. I have no home.</i>

00:50.175 --> 00:51.472
<i>I have no name.</i>

00:52.970 --> 00:56.474
You got much worse coming.
He calls himself Prometheus,

00:56.640 --> 00:58.608
and he's gonna end you.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.821
You want the Green Arrow.
I can give you his name.

01:02.980 --> 01:04.402
It's Oliver Queen.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.053
What's the status on Church's cell phone?

01:34.219 --> 01:35.971
<i>It's holding still
at Aparo and Puckett.</i>

01:36.138 --> 01:38.607
This is one well-traveled phone
considering its owner was killed

01:38.765 --> 01:40.187
on the other side of town last week.

01:40.350 --> 01:42.023
Prometheus is trying to bait me.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.983
<i>Yeah. That's the general point
I was trying to convey.</i>

01:44.187 --> 01:46.281
<i>And also that this is probably a trap.</i>

01:46.523 --> 01:47.991
You should've let me
call in the rest of the team.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.618
- No.
<i>- Why?</i>

01:50.068 --> 01:52.366
Because it's probably a trap.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.501
We've got this, Overwatch.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.162
Who is this?

02:40.744 --> 02:43.088
It's a lot of trouble to go to
for a prank.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.934
"And so it begins"?

03:04.351 --> 03:06.604
Who knew Prometheus was
a Babylon <i>5</i> fan-boy?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.613
Don't judge until you've seen it.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.774
- So what begins, that's the question?
- That's a good point.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.820
It would seem like he's already started,
considering he's dropped two bodies.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.122
I get killing Conahan, he led the ACU team

03:17.322 --> 03:19.871
to help the Green Arrow
rescue the city councilmen.

03:20.492 --> 03:23.291
- But why take out Church?
- According to Detective Malone

03:23.453 --> 03:25.956
it's because Church got in between
Prometheus and his real target.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.420
- The Green Arrow.
- Yes.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.961
So Church goes after you,
Prometheus goes after Church, and shunk!

03:32.921 --> 03:34.673
What? That was my
throwing star sound effect.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.093
- Why? What does yours sound like?
<i>- I just don</i> 't understand,

03:37.426 --> 03:39.394
a person that leaves a trail of dead cops

03:39.553 --> 03:42.147
just to kill a guy who's after you
because he wants to kill you himself.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.477
<i>Well, I'll say it again.</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:45.768
It's serious enough to warrant telling
the rest of the recruits.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.777
Who? Curtis and three people
we barely know?

03:47.936 --> 03:49.779
One of which gave up your identity
to Church,

03:49.938 --> 03:52.236
who we can only pray didn't share
that information with Prometheus.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.323
Well, for the record,
Rene didn't "give up" Oliver's identity.

03:55.652 --> 03:56.653
Okay? He was tortured.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.496
That's exactly
why we have to keep them out of this.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.498
I don't wanna put the recruits
in harm's way

04:00.657 --> 04:02.830
until we know exactly what it is
we're dealing with.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.009
Okay, once your wire is attached... Good.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.507
Now take the other one
and attach to battery

04:13.670 --> 04:15.513
and the other one to the igniter.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.183
I failed chemistry in high school.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.516
- Twice.
- Then learn like I did, in,

04:21.678 --> 04:24.522
- how you say, school of hard knock?
- I don't see the point of this.

04:24.681 --> 04:28.436
I'm here in Russia
to take out Konstantin Kovar.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.354
Not to learn how to make a bomb.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.194
You must be like sponge, Oliver.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.951
Making bomb, working with electronics,
welding metal.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.454
Bratva spend off hours
learning many trade.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.614
Fine.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.500
Attach one into igniter,
other one to battery terminal.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.660
Careful, do not touch circuit board.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.374
Oops.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.842
Get back!

05:00.050 --> 05:02.428
<i>It's okay, Oliver.</i>

05:02.719 --> 05:04.562
First time I try, I nearly lose finger.

05:23.573 --> 05:24.995
What the hell was that?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.536
Declaration of war against Bratva.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.704
<i>- By who?
- Your friend.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:31.331
Kovar.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.256
I'm proud of our new zoning ordinance.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.047
Along with the work
that's being done by the ACU.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.931
Our citizens need to feel safe,

05:40.131 --> 05:42.179
but they also need homes and jobs.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.429
Thank you for joining us.

05:45.595 --> 05:47.347
I, uh, overslept.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.434
- What're you gonna do? Dock my pay?
- No, no, it's just...

05:50.600 --> 05:52.728
It's not the first time
it's happened this week.

05:53.228 --> 05:54.946
Is there something you wanna tell me?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.778
If that's code for
"are you still drinking"

05:57.941 --> 06:01.115
then my answer hasn't changed
since the last 50 times you asked me.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.746
What the hell's he doing talking with her?

06:03.029 --> 06:04.622
It was his idea.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.118
She rakes him over the coals
about making me deputy mayor,

06:07.284 --> 06:08.957
- and now he gives her an interview?
- I think we're done.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.292
For all accounts, she's actually
going pretty easy on him.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.793
Great.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.418
- Thanks for taking the time.
- Thank you for giving me a chance

06:16.585 --> 06:18.053
to explain my side of the issues.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.135
Well, I said I'd give you a month
without any negative headlines.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.470
Clock's ticking.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.009
And it's ticking on the other thing, too.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.597
Right, um, the...

06:25.760 --> 06:27.478
Tick-tock, Mr. Mayor.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.888
<i>Ready?</i>

06:33.143 --> 06:35.316
You were not actually flirting
with that woman.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.572
She can <i>literally</i> ruin your career.

06:37.731 --> 06:40.280
I haven't done anything yet.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.153
- Wow.
- I hate that he just said "yet."

06:43.320 --> 06:45.573
Okay, come on.
There's something I wanna show you.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.502
- What is this?
- This is a music and arts festival.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.208
Seattle's been hosting one for decades.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.171
I mean, they are great for publicity,
and tourism, tax revenue...

06:57.334 --> 07:01.089
Except, revenue is what you're gonna need
to pull that off and we don't have revenue

07:01.296 --> 07:03.219
- to pull that off.
- Yes, we do, because

07:03.506 --> 07:05.929
the mayor's chief of staff
is a former nightclub owner.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.720
And all the right people
still owe me the right favors, so...

07:08.887 --> 07:11.060
I mean, I may not be able to get
all of these bands there,

07:11.222 --> 07:12.269
but enough to draw a crowd.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.685
Well, Speedy, this is, this is good work.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.688
Well, I... I still need a venue.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.357
Let's put together a list, I'll make
whatever calls you need me to make.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.524
Okay.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.444
Actually, I might have an "in"
at the Rockets Arena.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.866
Deputy Mayor Lance.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.908
Hold off on giving me keys to the city.
I just know a guy.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.664
I'm just trying to do
whatever I can to help.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.369
Thank you.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.357
Please... Please...

07:58.603 --> 08:00.776
Take whatever you want! Just don't...

08:01.272 --> 08:02.489
I have two children.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.191
Could we get the room for a minute?

08:43.857 --> 08:47.452
Neat trick. Must come in handy when
you lock yourself out of your place.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.908
I'm Adrian Chase. I'm the new D.A.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.870
I thought crime scenes
were below a D.A.'s pay grade.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.460
I'm not that kind of D.A.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.162
What's your excuse for being here?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.547
Radio call mentioned the murder weapon.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.338
Like Church and Lieutenant Conahan.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.256
What do you have on the victim?

09:04.586 --> 09:05.587
Gay Eked.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.802
Divorced mother of two.
And before you ask,

09:07.964 --> 09:10.683
her ex has an airtight alibi
and Mrs. Eked's criminality

09:10.842 --> 09:12.970
is limited to three parking tickets.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.142
What do you know that I don't?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.985
The killer calls himself Prometheus.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.690
And why would this Prometheus
target an average housewife?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.033
Another body just dropped.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.448
<i>Another throwing star murder.</i>

09:35.825 --> 09:37.919
<i>Peter Meld, 38, cab driver.</i>

09:38.078 --> 09:39.625
He was killed
while filling his taxi up with gas.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.381
Oliver's headed to the crime scene now.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.213
Okay. Any connection
between Meld and Gay Eked?

09:44.375 --> 09:47.094
Just the same M.O.,
killed by a throwing star.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.680
Hmm.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.431
You know, Felicity, it sure would be nice
to get our hands on one.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.685
Yeah.

09:56.012 --> 09:57.013
What?

09:57.305 --> 09:59.478
- Why're you looking at me like that?
- I'm not the one dating

09:59.641 --> 10:01.735
- a detective.
- Oh. No. Well, Billy doesn't know

10:01.893 --> 10:02.894
that I work with the Green Arrow.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.280
I'm not crazy about overlapping
my work and personal lives.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.782
And even if I was, what am I
supposed to do, steal it off his desk?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.534
Felicity, you're one of the
smartest people I know.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.114
I'm sure you'll think of something.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.121
Four bodies so far. Let's do
whatever we can to make sure

10:14.280 --> 10:16.282
- it doesn't become number five.
- Ah, that sounds like an argument

10:16.449 --> 10:18.042
in favor of looping in the recruits.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.454
When there's a reason to, we will.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.502
This is the reason, we should do it now.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.378
- What'd you find?
- Nothing but the victim's blood.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.468
No fibers, no shards, no prints.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.257
So how the hell
are we supposed to find this guy?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.891
Apparently, we're not.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.057
Oh. You do not look happy.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.476
Is it because I'm not bearing Americanos?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.392
- No, it's not the coffee, it's a case.
- The throwing star killings?

10:42.559 --> 10:44.732
Kind of hard to miss.
Although apparently this guy didn't.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.568
Oh. That was unexpectedly morbid. Coffee?

10:47.856 --> 10:49.529
Which actually brings me to why I'm here,

10:49.732 --> 10:51.234
not the coffee, the morbidness.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.078
I was friends with one of the victims
in your case.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.454
Well, more like, acquaintances.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.366
You know. Friend of a friend of a friend.

10:58.533 --> 11:02.037
Is this the, uh, same "friend"
whose housekeeper got their towel stolen?

11:02.203 --> 11:04.331
It wasn't a towel, it was a rag, and no.

11:04.789 --> 11:06.632
- Totally different friend.
- Wow.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.216
Another friend involved
in a random crime in the city.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.379
Ooh.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.306
You must run in
a pretty rough crowd.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.592
You have no idea.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.102
I'd have a better one
if you'd just cut the crap

11:18.261 --> 11:19.854
and tell me whatever it is
you're not telling me.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.356
What? There's no deception here.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.608
I actually was, kind of, sort of,
friends with a victim,

11:23.766 --> 11:25.143
- Gay Eked.
- "Kind of, sort of"?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.233
Pike wants us in his office.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.273
- We'll talk later.
- Uh...

11:41.951 --> 11:45.000
Okay. So, we've got
a problem with your girlfriend.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.590
- Who?
- Susan Williams.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.464
<i>Detective William Malone, who is believed
to be in charge of the investigation,</i>

11:53.630 --> 11:56.053
<i>- could not be reached for comment.</i>
- This is a <i>disaster.</i>

11:56.216 --> 11:58.560
<i>Nor has SCPD issued a statement
on the matter.</i>

11:58.718 --> 12:01.767
<i>But it is believed that this
"Throwing Star Killer" is responsible</i>

12:01.930 --> 12:05.400
<i>for a total of four deaths so far,
including that of reputed crime lord</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:07.936
- Tobias Church.
- "Throwing Star Killer"?

12:08.102 --> 12:09.649
You have to admit it has a certain flair.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.189
<i>I don't need
to be the one to tell you</i>

12:11.356 --> 12:13.984
that having a city-wide panic
is, like, the worst thing

12:14.150 --> 12:15.868
- that can happen before this festival.
- No, Thea.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.787
You don't have to tell me that.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.995
Anatoly? Why didn't you tell me

12:25.161 --> 12:27.459
that Kovar was making a move
against the Bratva?

12:27.622 --> 12:30.296
You know he's the reason
that I'm here in the first place.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.428
I told you, Kovar has army.
Who did you think his enemy was?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.931
You told me I could get at Kovar
by joining the Bratva.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.842
It looks like
you are going to get your chance.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.103
Well, <i>Pakhan</i> is going to be here
any moment. He'll explain everything.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.064
Tidy yourself up, show him your respect.

13:13.251 --> 13:16.221
Ah. The puppy speaks.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.470
<i>The infamous Oliver Queen. What?</i>

13:19.882 --> 13:22.226
Did you think that we would
not learn of your past?

13:22.677 --> 13:25.556
That we would allow rich American
into this organization

13:25.763 --> 13:27.231
without special circumstances?

13:27.432 --> 13:29.730
- I've earned my place here.
- So I hear.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.520
So why don't you tell me
what the hell is going on!

13:32.687 --> 13:33.813
Oliver, respect.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.608
It's okay, Anatoly. Hmm.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.743
I appreciate his eagerness.

13:42.071 --> 13:46.542
Kovar decided to expand his territory.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.079
A casino. What happened here tonight

13:49.245 --> 13:51.293
is warning for us to stay away.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.877
- But we're not going to do that.
- So what are we gonna do?

13:55.043 --> 13:57.091
Kovar needs money to expand.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.599
Investors. Like, say a rich American.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.676
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

14:03.926 --> 14:07.100
You can get meeting with his people.
When you do, you're gonna get inside

14:07.263 --> 14:09.607
and you're going to blow
his new casino up.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.269
And you thought making bomb
was waste of time.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.233
What do you say, Oliver?

14:14.395 --> 14:17.114
Ready to play
a rich American playboy again?

14:20.026 --> 14:23.155
Your new girlfriend certainly knows
how to whip a city into a frenzy.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.790
- Excuse me.
- Thea might've mentioned something about

14:25.948 --> 14:29.043
- you dating Susan Williams.
- I'm not dating Susan Williams.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.671
Did the person that you're dating
actually give you that?

14:31.829 --> 14:33.081
No.

14:34.665 --> 14:36.918
- I might've stolen it off his desk.
- Are you kidding...

14:37.085 --> 14:40.009
I generally don't kid about something that
could get me 10 years at Iron Heights.

14:40.171 --> 14:44.221
- Well, I hope it was worth it.
- Yeah, so far, not so much.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.558
And here I was just so happy Curtis got
our gas chromatograph working again.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.313
I'm hoping to have better luck with this.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.316
I've plugged the four victims
into an algorithm that ViCAP uses

14:52.475 --> 14:55.479
to track serial killers. The computer can
tease out connections between the victims

14:55.645 --> 14:57.898
- that the FBI generally doesn't make.
- Well, that's smart.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.817
And I cross-referenced in our own database
along with SCPD's to hopefully

15:00.983 --> 15:02.701
get better results.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.408
- What is that?
- News alert.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.709
<i>Reports are just coming in that someone
spotted the Throwing Star Killer</i>

15:09.867 --> 15:12.837
<i>at an outdoor shopping mall,
inciting widespread panic</i>

15:12.995 --> 15:15.498
<i>that is threatening to spill into nearby
streets and homes.</i>

15:15.665 --> 15:17.838
Well, I hope your new girlfriend
is happy with herself.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.422
Let's call the team
and have them meet me there.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.258
- All of them?
- All of them.

15:21.421 --> 15:24.015
They deserve to know
that this has escalated.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.180
And stop calling Susan Williams
my girlfriend.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.852
Yes, sir.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.292
Who the hell are those guys?

15:51.451 --> 15:52.953
They're just shooting into the dark.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.291
<i>GREEN ARROW". It's because they're scared.</i>

15:54.454 --> 15:56.377
<i>Prometheus probably
isn't even here.</i>

15:56.539 --> 15:58.382
Our job here is to keep the peace.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.339
Me, Spartan and Ragman
will handle the shooters.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.923
Everyone else get people to safety.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.054
Why's Ragman get to have all the fun?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.390
Because I said so.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.643
I'll never get tired of this part.

16:27.195 --> 16:30.574
Oh, no! Make it stop. Please.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.624
You're safe with us, okay? Come with me.

16:35.953 --> 16:37.921
You saved us. Thank you.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.665
It's okay.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.794
That's it. Come on.

16:47.590 --> 16:48.591
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:48.758 --> 16:50.977
Slow down. Slow down. Slow down.
Hey, man, you all right?

16:51.219 --> 16:53.768
I got you. Let's get out of here.
You're safe. Come on.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.564
There's no threat here. Go home.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.233
He's up there! Get behind me!

17:11.155 --> 17:15.410
The killer isn't here. You're safe. Go.
Move. Move. Now. Now! Go. Go!

17:17.286 --> 17:18.708
Put your weapon down!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.964
I've got a right to protect myself.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.261
- Hey, that's my property!
- Not anymore.

17:29.423 --> 17:33.223
The Throwing Star Killer isn't here.
All you are doing is causing panic.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.393
Go home. Now.

17:36.639 --> 17:39.017
<i>This is the SCPD.</i>

17:42.687 --> 17:45.315
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

17:51.320 --> 17:54.824
Well, if Prometheus wanted to
push the public into a frenzy,

17:54.991 --> 17:56.117
mission accomplished.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.254
Well, I'm guessing
we're not gonna like his encore either.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.167
I will stop helping.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.378
We need to canvass the city.
Felicity can coordinate.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.669
We need to help the SCPD maintain order.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.964
- Hold up a sec.
- More, like, back up. Way up.

18:09.130 --> 18:12.930
Yeah, tonight's the first we're hearing
of a serial killer operating in the city.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.517
He calls himself Prometheus.
He's the one who killed Tobias Church.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.182
Did you know about this?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.771
He knew about this.
Why didn't we know about this?

18:21.976 --> 18:24.525
You know about him now.
So let's get to work.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.362
These throwing star killings
are some kind of message

18:29.525 --> 18:32.825
that Prometheus is sending to Oliver.
He's calling him out.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.409
Sounds like, and I'm guessing,

18:34.572 --> 18:36.199
you and blondie have known
about this a while.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.084
- Yeah, that's not insulting at all.
- Evelyn, this isn't about feelings

18:39.327 --> 18:42.456
or ego. We had to vet the situation.

18:42.622 --> 18:46.047
He means the A-Team had to make
sure the B-Team was worthy enough

18:46.208 --> 18:47.209
of being kept in the loop.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.549
<i>All right,
the only team here is Team Arrow.</i>

18:49.712 --> 18:51.635
I actually agree with you guys.
But the whole city is going

18:51.839 --> 18:53.591
- nutso crazy right now so...
- She's right.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.556
- There's plenty of time for this later.
- Except for Curtis.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.187
I need your brain
on this victimology algorithm.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.563
- Sir.
- Victimology algorithm.

19:03.726 --> 19:06.320
This is just like Zodiac.
And I'm Jake Gyllenhaal.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.073
- Wait, wouldn't you be...
- Don't take this from me.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.620
Ollie, where are you?

19:14.779 --> 19:18.033
This place is going through
five kinds of hell right now.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.749
What do we have?

20:08.249 --> 20:10.422
You guys, uh, think you wanna
clear the room for us?

20:10.584 --> 20:11.585
Seriously, bro?

20:11.752 --> 20:14.301
Felicity and Curtis found
something, we wanna know what it is.

20:14.463 --> 20:16.886
Yeah, we're a team. Or at least we were.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.178
- Fine. What do we have?
- At first, not much of anything.

20:20.344 --> 20:24.474
No links between home addresses,
personal histories, favorite colors, nada.

20:24.640 --> 20:29.146
So the victimology algorithm moved on
to crazy Zodiac Killer kind of stuff.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.234
Such as looking for anagrams.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.616
In case Prometheus was sending a message

20:33.774 --> 20:36.152
in the names of the victims
he's been choosing.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.821
- Is he?
- Kind of.

20:39.488 --> 20:44.915
The first four victims, Tobias Church,
Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, Gay Eked.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.045
Victims three and four
were not random.

20:47.204 --> 20:51.004
We think Prometheus is using those names
as anagrams to spell out other names.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.171
Adam Hunt. Ted Gaynor.
Palmer Cokes. Sachi Beech.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.179
Those names supposed to
mean anything to us?

20:56.338 --> 20:57.885
They do to him.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.264
Care to enlighten?

21:01.552 --> 21:03.225
Those names are on the list.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.224
What the hell is the list?

21:15.274 --> 21:19.074
Let me get this straight,
you got a "to kill" list?

21:19.695 --> 21:22.039
- And I'm the out of control one?
- I haven't used that list,

21:22.198 --> 21:24.292
I haven't looked at it in four years.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.044
Wait. Four years, I thought
there was some other guy in the hood?

21:27.203 --> 21:31.674
No, that was Oliver. "The Hood,"
"The Arrow," "Green Arrow," all him.

21:31.832 --> 21:35.052
That notebook belonged to my father.
And when I was first starting out,

21:35.211 --> 21:37.464
I thought that it was my way
to save the city.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.804
Well, I think we now know the message
Prometheus is trying to send.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.310
You do? 'Cause, I don't. Do you guys?

21:43.469 --> 21:45.187
He's saying you're the serial killer.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.222
Harsh.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.063
- But feeling pretty accurate.
- I was trying to help this city.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.899
<i>Prometheus isn't.</i>

21:53.229 --> 21:56.654
You convinced me to not get revenge
on Ruvé Darhk

21:56.816 --> 22:00.992
for my parents because killing would
tarnish the Black Canary's legacy.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.037
How are you anything
other than a hypocrite?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.792
First, it would've tarnished her legacy.

22:06.951 --> 22:09.579
Second, you knew that I was a killer
when you came on board.

22:09.787 --> 22:12.757
Not a serial killer.
I know some of these names.

22:12.915 --> 22:16.385
You've got bankers in here.
Lawyers. A city councilman.

22:17.086 --> 22:20.010
You need to anagram the names on the list
against Star City's population.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.096
Because that should point us
towards Prometheus' next targets.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.809
I know it's not much to look at now,
but with your investment,

22:30.975 --> 22:33.444
we can make it a premier
destination in the area.

22:33.602 --> 22:38.779
No, look, as long as you have craps
in here. Right? I am awesome at craps.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.493
You gotta fill this place with girls.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.701
- Tons of girls.
- I'm sure you will be very pleased.

22:44.864 --> 22:47.413
All of your requests will be accommodated.

22:47.575 --> 22:50.419
I'm convinced, but my associate

22:50.619 --> 22:53.543
Would like to see the blueprints just
to make sure you're all buttoned up, yeah?

22:54.164 --> 22:55.962
Here you are.

22:58.043 --> 23:01.798
I can have copies sent to your hotel.
But first...

23:04.425 --> 23:05.597
Yes.

23:07.845 --> 23:10.519
- You want to see the money.
- Not to be rude, but, yes.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.150
That's fine. That's fine.
Show the man the money.

23:19.315 --> 23:24.321
This will do just fine, Mr. Queen.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.580
If you don't mind my asking,

23:26.739 --> 23:29.868
why you have not returned home?
Supposedly you're a big deal.

23:35.331 --> 23:39.837
All right. We wanna set the charges
there and there.

23:40.002 --> 23:42.721
For maximum damage. What?

23:43.297 --> 23:46.892
You play, what's American term,
"douche" very well.

23:47.051 --> 23:48.769
Let's get this over with.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.732
What?

24:05.736 --> 24:06.988
Quentin?

24:11.575 --> 24:12.952
Are you home?

24:17.706 --> 24:18.923
Quentin?

24:20.376 --> 24:21.753
- What're you doing...
- God!

24:21.919 --> 24:22.920
What're you doing? What are you...

24:23.087 --> 24:24.213
What, are you trying
to kill me or something?

24:24.380 --> 24:27.975
Where the hell have you been?
The whole city is in crisis.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.682
Well, yeah, my stomach's been
on a tear since lunch. l...

24:30.844 --> 24:34.724
It must have been some fish.
It was the fish. It was the damn fish.

24:34.890 --> 24:37.894
Yeah. Probably didn't wash down
well with all the whiskey.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.400
When did you relapse?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.527
You didn't... You...

24:47.361 --> 24:49.238
You've been drinking the whole time.

24:50.364 --> 24:51.581
You lied to me.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.742
Well, I'm a drunk, Thea.
That's what we do.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.628
- Yeah, okay. I'm taking you to a meeting.
- Hmm.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.295
You can't help a man
who doesn't wanna be helped.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.796
Watch me.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.932
Lam not giving up on you.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.598
And I'm not letting you give up
on yourself.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.305
I don't think that

25:14.471 --> 25:17.065
his deputy mayor
being seen at an A.A. meeting

25:17.224 --> 25:19.443
is exactly what your brother needs
right now.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.317
The second "A"
stands for "anonymous," right?

25:27.609 --> 25:29.361
What the hell is this thing?

25:30.696 --> 25:34.121
Oh, um, thanks. What is this?

25:34.658 --> 25:38.162
Regan family schnapps recipe.
It's strong and a little sweet.

25:38.787 --> 25:42.291
Just like you. I thought we could use some
considering the circumstances.

25:42.458 --> 25:45.462
- Would you care for some?
- Um, Rory, she's 17.

25:45.627 --> 25:48.005
So? My dad was giving me this stuff
when I was 11.

25:48.172 --> 25:50.971
And what a fine weirdo
you turned out to be. Mmm.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.635
Mmm.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.479
Look, if this little meeting is
because we learned Oliver's a killer,

25:55.637 --> 25:57.560
I've got news for you, it's not news.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.526
Look, killing Damien Darhk,
and Church's guys is one thing.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.062
But having a secret kill list...

26:03.228 --> 26:06.402
Yeah, that he never even told us about.
It's something completely different.

26:06.565 --> 26:09.068
Well, what's not different
is him not telling us stuff.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.861
Haven't you noticed when it comes to
information sharing,

26:11.111 --> 26:12.488
there seems to be two different teams?

26:12.821 --> 26:14.494
It's only gotten worse
since Diggle's been back.

26:14.656 --> 26:17.330
Make up your mind, guys, are you pissed
because Oliver killed people

26:17.493 --> 26:19.120
or that he doesn't tell us everything?

26:19.703 --> 26:21.125
How about both?

26:21.288 --> 26:24.041
How about I'm pissed that the guy
who only shares the important information

26:24.208 --> 26:26.176
with his inner circle
used to be a serial killer?

26:26.335 --> 26:28.758
Which again, he didn't tell us about.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.555
Look,

26:31.381 --> 26:33.099
we all want to believe
in Oliver's crusade.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.643
But how are we
supposed to follow him into a battle

26:35.844 --> 26:38.563
when his first instinct
is to hide the truth from us?

26:39.306 --> 26:41.604
First it's "I used to be a serial killer."

26:41.850 --> 26:43.523
What's tomorrow's revelation going to be?

26:45.854 --> 26:48.949
I don't know how to operate
with that in the back of my mind.

26:57.866 --> 27:01.040
Wow, haven't seen you do that
in quite some time.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.748
I wanted
to take my mind off things.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.960
Yeah. I don't think they make
enough tennis balls for that.

27:10.587 --> 27:13.386
Where's Felicity
with the list of potential targets?

27:13.549 --> 27:15.722
She's working on it. It's a big city.

27:15.884 --> 27:16.885
Yeah.

27:19.096 --> 27:22.475
Something tells me,
that's not the only thing weighing on you.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.227
- How are the recruits?
- Taking a little time out.

27:25.435 --> 27:28.814
I expected them to be upset
with me and that's fine. But...

27:28.981 --> 27:30.699
John, they seemed horrified.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.031
No, I wouldn't call it that.
Just a bit surprised.

27:33.193 --> 27:35.491
<i>Look on the bright side,
it does show how far you've come.</i>

27:35.654 --> 27:37.622
I haven't seen that guy in a long time.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.663
And the way the kids reacted...

27:41.493 --> 27:42.710
I think it proves how much you've changed.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.292
Except I haven't.

27:44.788 --> 27:48.133
I killed Damien Darhk,
and I haven't stopped since.

27:51.420 --> 27:55.095
Yeah, well, don't forget
who you're talking to, man.

27:55.757 --> 27:58.101
I know, first hand,
what it's like to be a murderer.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.515
I know the difference
between a good kill

28:02.723 --> 28:05.021
and one made out of pure rage.

28:07.936 --> 28:10.564
You killed Damien Darhk, Oliver,
because you had to.

28:10.731 --> 28:13.405
You took down Church's men,
because you had to.

28:13.567 --> 28:17.868
The list was something different.
You were targeting lawyers, stockbrokers.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.282
You were killing as a first resort,
not a last.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.201
And now Prometheus is just

28:23.160 --> 28:24.958
dredging all that up again.

28:27.372 --> 28:31.343
I wanna move forward.
I'm trying to move forward. But I...

28:34.630 --> 28:37.759
- I feel stuck.
- I think you're being hard on yourself.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.225
Which is a bit annoying because
that's usually mine and Felicity's job.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.310
But, Oliver, in that official capacity,

28:47.059 --> 28:48.481
I think you are moving forward.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.363
I think you're evolving.
I think you're growing.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.365
What makes you so sure?

28:53.523 --> 28:54.570
Because that guy with the list

28:54.775 --> 28:56.823
wouldn't have even thought
to ask the question.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.663
I need</i> a <i>cleanup on Aisle 12.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.700
<i>And, also,
I got a list of potential victims.</i>

29:07.996 --> 29:11.170
I know you're all upset with me.
So, thank you for showing up despite that.

29:11.333 --> 29:14.212
Well, we were afraid you would kill us
if we didn't.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.801
- Too soon? Okay.
- I was able to cross-reference the list

29:16.964 --> 29:21.060
with the city census,
nailing it down to six potential targets.

29:21.218 --> 29:22.515
How do we know who he'll hit?

29:22.678 --> 29:24.180
We don't. In order to cover
that much ground,

29:24.346 --> 29:26.644
we have to split up
and each take one potential target.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.401
We run surveillance. Whoever spots
Prometheus first, call it in.

29:29.559 --> 29:31.027
Then we all converge.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.479
Cool.

29:37.025 --> 29:39.278
- Is everything okay?
- No. It's not.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.115
For a long time, I blamed you
for my parents dying.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.876
That you were responsible
for leaving them to suffocate

29:46.076 --> 29:47.749
in one of Damien Darhk's
testing chambers.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.838
- I know.
- It took a lot

29:49.997 --> 29:51.465
for me to come work with you.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.375
Knowing all this,

29:54.710 --> 29:56.383
it doesn't make it any easier.

29:56.586 --> 29:59.556
Evelyn, are you sure
you should be out there tonight?

29:59.756 --> 30:01.178
Yes, lam.

30:01.341 --> 30:05.016
Because I'm doing this,
protecting people, for me.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.143
Not for you.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.383
- I've got eyes on Target Number Four.
<i>- Copy</i> that.

30:35.917 --> 30:37.510
You know, it seems we have a minute alone,

30:37.711 --> 30:40.339
- is there anything you want to talk about?
- No.

30:40.756 --> 30:42.383
Are you sure? 'Cause I'm kind of an expert

30:42.591 --> 30:45.185
when it comes to finding out
ugly things about Oliver's past.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.683
Actually, I'm the...
I'm the leading expert.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.063
<i>- Overwatch?</i>
- Yeah?

30:49.306 --> 30:51.024
I really don't want to talk about it.

30:58.440 --> 30:59.566
Oh, my God.

31:06.239 --> 31:07.491
Get back!

31:09.409 --> 31:12.288
- The hell?
- Get out of here! Go call 911!

31:13.121 --> 31:14.873
Stay away from him!

31:24.132 --> 31:25.600
- Go.
- We've got a problem.

31:25.759 --> 31:27.432
Artemis seems to have
disconnected her coms.

31:27.594 --> 31:28.686
<i>She in trouble?</i>

31:28.845 --> 31:30.893
I don't know, but I'm worried
she wouldn't tell us if she was.

31:31.056 --> 31:32.182
Do you have her 20?

31:32.349 --> 31:34.317
<i>When Wild Dog was kidnapped,
I put trackers in all their suits.</i>

31:34.476 --> 31:36.069
I'm sending you the information now.

31:37.646 --> 31:40.149
- She's moving.
- She's on a subway that's moving.

31:40.315 --> 31:42.488
Train's a few blocks from here.
I'll go check on her.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.153
You tell everyone else to hold
their position.

32:02.671 --> 32:06.016
Hey... Hey... Come on, man.
Come on, please!

32:17.727 --> 32:19.775
- You okay?
- Yeah. What the hell was that?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.531
Stop the train.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.404
<i>He'!-</i>

32:24.943 --> 32:27.196
- You all right?
- I wasn't going to be.

32:28.488 --> 32:30.161
Prometheus?
- Gone.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.746
Whatever he's planning,
it wasn't to engage me tonight.

32:32.909 --> 32:34.536
Hey, we got a problem.

32:34.703 --> 32:36.831
- We got a big problem.
- What?

32:43.044 --> 32:45.297
I don't have time to disarm that.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.557
We're getting off the train. Come on.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.890
You're joking, right? 'Cause now's a
really bad time to be trying out jokes.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.224
Trust me.

33:23.418 --> 33:24.795
Good as new.

33:25.921 --> 33:28.140
What's gonna happen to the train guy?

33:28.298 --> 33:32.303
This morning, Mayor Queen is gonna
put him and Prometheus' five other targets

33:32.511 --> 33:34.263
into witness protection
until this is over.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.852
Won't Prometheus just
find another way to go after you?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.016
Probably.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.060
But when he does, we will deal with it.

33:40.227 --> 33:43.106
And, I promise, you will find out
right when I do.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.111
I was a jerk.

33:52.197 --> 33:54.916
And I'm sorry.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.328
No, Evelyn, I'm...

33:59.162 --> 34:00.288
I'm sorry.

34:01.665 --> 34:02.882
I'm sorry for your parents.

34:04.918 --> 34:07.296
I'm sorry that I'm not the man
you thought I was.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.800
But John reminded me, as he does,

34:13.134 --> 34:16.353
that I'm trying to be that man.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.476
And I might actually be getting there.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.648
Slowly.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.148
In the meantime,

34:26.438 --> 34:28.533
I would really appreciate your patience.

34:28.858 --> 34:30.360
Sounds reasonable to me.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.375
When I was a boy

34:40.911 --> 34:43.415
my mother told me
a story about her grandfather.

34:44.791 --> 34:49.170
She said he grew a turnip so large
that he could not pull it up by himself.

34:50.505 --> 34:54.054
So he asked his wife to help,
but together they could not do it.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.016
So they asked my uncle,

34:57.178 --> 35:00.022
my aunts, everybody to pitch in, but...

35:00.181 --> 35:03.060
Yet they could not pull the turnip
out of the ground.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.112
And so I said,

35:07.522 --> 35:09.069
"Mama, Mama,

35:10.317 --> 35:12.820
"did he ever pull the turnip
out of the ground?"

35:14.029 --> 35:15.531
And she said, "Yes.

35:16.281 --> 35:17.453
"But only...

35:18.325 --> 35:21.044
"Only after they called everybody
in the village."

35:21.369 --> 35:23.963
Every man, woman and child.

35:24.414 --> 35:27.714
Every farmer, every Vagabond.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.383
Every animal even.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.513
The dogs and the cats.

35:33.840 --> 35:37.014
And finally, together,

35:39.596 --> 35:42.099
they wrestled it free.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.398
Does your story have a point?

35:47.354 --> 35:48.480
Yes.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.066
That without unity

35:51.691 --> 35:54.240
one cannot accomplish anything in life.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.622
As I got older, I realized it also meant
something else.

35:58.740 --> 35:59.992
That scum

36:00.742 --> 36:02.915
will never amount to anything
without help.

36:04.663 --> 36:09.134
That the Solntsevskaya Bratva
can pull at the turnip all they want.

36:09.292 --> 36:12.136
But they will never, ever,

36:13.088 --> 36:14.089
ever

36:15.590 --> 36:16.967
set it free.

36:17.884 --> 36:18.931
Oh.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.643
Yes, that and, uh...

36:25.809 --> 36:28.278
To become a damn farmer.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.285
Hello,

36:40.824 --> 36:42.292
Oliver Queen.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.297
My name is Konstantin Kovar.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.841
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

37:03.638 --> 37:04.810
<i>Hey.</i>

37:05.056 --> 37:09.311
Oh, so, to what latest crime or criminal
do I owe the pleasure of this visit?

37:09.477 --> 37:11.445
I thoroughly deserve that.

37:12.105 --> 37:14.278
Is there somewhere private we can go chat?

37:14.566 --> 37:16.193
Step into my office.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.498
Oh, yes, the interrogation room.
How appropriate.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.206
Felicity, I was just giving you
a hard time.

37:25.368 --> 37:29.373
I figure whenever you're ready to tell me
whatever's going on with you,

37:29.539 --> 37:30.882
you'll tell me.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.667
I'm gonna tell you now.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.135
I have this friend.

37:35.336 --> 37:36.758
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

37:37.005 --> 37:40.726
Who I just watched for the umpteenth
time not tell the people

37:41.217 --> 37:43.686
he's closest to what is going on with him.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.602
I don't want to be like that.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.560
I don't want you to be like that.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.779
So, what is it, are you,
like, a serial killer?

37:52.937 --> 37:55.531
Or something? The Throwing Star Killer?
A true crime groupie?

37:55.690 --> 37:58.364
I've got a million scenarios running
through my mind. Like, you're...

37:58.568 --> 37:59.615
I work for the Green Arrow.

38:05.200 --> 38:06.702
That wasn't one of 'em.

38:06.868 --> 38:10.122
It's why I keep odd hours and
why I disappear at random times.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.710
And it's why I keep asking you
for favors,

38:11.873 --> 38:12.874
and in case you haven't noticed,

38:13.082 --> 38:15.176
it's why I stole evidence off your desk.

38:15.376 --> 38:16.844
You know, I looked everywhere for that.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.630
It goes without saying that me
being like a criminal

38:18.797 --> 38:20.390
probably isn't good for our relationship.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.552
But you're not <i>like</i> a criminal, Felicity.
You are one.

38:31.059 --> 38:33.357
But it's for a good cause.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.739
Seriously? Are you not, like, mad?

38:36.898 --> 38:39.572
Or hurt? Or feeling a lack of trust?

38:39.734 --> 38:41.031
I'd be a jerk if I did.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.446
Felicity,

38:44.322 --> 38:46.165
you're helping save this city.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.751
Wow, that went a lot better
than I expected.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.878
I just got so many questions.

38:51.037 --> 38:54.291
Do you know where he lives?
Is his face all scarred or something?

38:54.457 --> 38:56.551
- Is that why he wears a hood?
- Billy, Billy, Billy.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.635
Shut up.

38:59.587 --> 39:00.930
Yes, ma'am.

39:07.929 --> 39:10.557
- Thanks for putting this together, Speedy.
- I can't take all the credit.

39:10.723 --> 39:13.476
- Lance did come up with the venue.
- Shouldn't he be here?

39:13.935 --> 39:17.610
Oh... Yeah. He came down with that flu
that everyone's been catching,

39:17.856 --> 39:20.780
- so he just decided to sit this one out.
- Oh. Hey!

39:21.025 --> 39:24.700
Well, if it isn't my favorite chief
of staff. How are you doing?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.410
Still not interested.

39:28.116 --> 39:33.464
Ooh. It's cool, man.
Nobody saw you get completely shot down.

39:35.373 --> 39:37.216
You know, 'cause we did see you get...

39:37.375 --> 39:39.753
- Everything looks really nice, Mr. Mayor.
- Thank you, Curtis.

39:39.919 --> 39:43.264
Yeah, I can't remember the last time
I saw a concert. Or danced.

39:43.423 --> 39:45.801
- Or smiled apparently.
- Okay.

39:45.967 --> 39:47.310
Come on, Rory. Just follow our lead.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.140
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.650
Can I talk to you privately?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.861
Yeah. Give us a second please, guys.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.731
- What's going on?
- You remember the throwing star

39:59.898 --> 40:01.445
that I stole from my boyfriend. From...

40:01.649 --> 40:03.743
My... From Malone? You remember the...
You remember this?

40:03.902 --> 40:05.119
You said it didn't turn anything up.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.073
- Pretty sure I used the word "yet."
- Okay. So, now?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.913
The alloy is very specific,
with trace quantities

40:11.075 --> 40:12.702
containing dozens of different
genetic markers.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.879
And I was able to nail
the forensic evidence down

40:15.079 --> 40:17.377
- to coming within the past four years.
- What're you trying to tell me?

40:17.582 --> 40:19.630
This is gonna sound crazy,
but so is Prometheus.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.011
I think that Prometheus has gotten
his hands on the various arrows

40:22.170 --> 40:23.888
you've used over the past four years,
melted them down

40:24.047 --> 40:25.549
and fashioned weapons out of them.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.774
But if that's true,
that would mean that...

40:34.933 --> 40:38.187
That would mean that Prometheus
has access to SCPD lockup.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.734
Oliver, I think we have a real lead
on who Prometheus is.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.282
He's a member of the SCPD.
