WEBVTT

00:11.900 --> 00:13.867
RICHARD AND CINDY?

00:13.867 --> 00:15.400
VERY DEEPLY IN LOVE.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.400
SINCE WHEN?

00:16.400 --> 00:17.400
LUNCH.

00:17.400 --> 00:18.867
WHAT DID THEY EAT?

00:18.867 --> 00:23.033
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IT DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE IT WAS ENOUGH.

00:23.033 --> 00:25.100
AH, MR. HECKLE
AND MR. JEKYLL.

00:25.100 --> 00:26.900
DON'T WE HAVE CLASSES
TO ATTEND?

00:26.900 --> 00:30.000
MR. FEENY,
SHOULDN'T YOU
BREAK THEM UP

00:30.000 --> 00:32.233
OR HOSE THEM DOWN
OR SOMETHING?

00:32.233 --> 00:35.133
OH, I WOULDN'T INTERRUPT
THEIR TRYST,
MR. MATTHEWS.

00:35.133 --> 00:38.800
THEY'RE BOTH A-MINUS
STUDENTS AND HAPPILY
STRUCK BY CUPID.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.934
IF THEY WERE C-MINUS
STUDENTS, YOU WOULDN'T
LET THEM KISS?

00:42.934 --> 00:45.133
SCHOOL POLICY,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

00:45.133 --> 00:46.133
SO I CAN'T KISS?

00:46.133 --> 00:47.834
WITH YOUR GRADES,
MR. MATTHEWS,

00:47.834 --> 00:49.900
YOU CAN'T EVEN
SHAKE HANDS.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.367
JUST WATCH, MR. FEENY.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.900
BY THE END OF THE YEAR,

00:52.900 --> 00:56.400
I PLAN TO HAVE
A A-PLUS AVERAGE
AND A HICKEY.

00:58.200 --> 01:01.800
DARE TO DREAM,
MR. MATTHEWS.

01:01.800 --> 01:05.000
HOLY COW.
JERRY AND SHOSHANA?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
DEEPLY.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.500
HAS THE WHOLE WORLD
PAIRED OFF?

01:08.500 --> 01:09.500
PRETTY MUCH.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.867
IS THERE A LIST
POSTED SOMEWHERE

01:11.867 --> 01:14.100
WITH THE GIRL
ASSIGNED TO ME?

01:14.100 --> 01:15.934
YOU WANT A GIRLFRIEND?

01:15.934 --> 01:17.133
NO, NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

01:17.133 --> 01:19.834
JUST A GIRL
WHO'S LIKE A FRIEND,

01:19.834 --> 01:21.300
BUT NOT A GIRLFRIEND.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.600
HOW ABOUT HER?

01:22.600 --> 01:24.800
HOW ABOUT THE NEW GIRL?

01:24.800 --> 01:25.900
NO.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.667
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW HER.

01:28.667 --> 01:29.900
SHUT UP!

01:29.900 --> 01:32.233
I WANT SOMEONE I KNOW.

01:32.233 --> 01:33.500
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS ME.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.834
SOMEONE WHO
WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

01:35.834 --> 01:38.000
SOMEONE, LIKE, UH...

01:38.000 --> 01:39.967
TOPANGA!

01:39.967 --> 01:41.467
TOPANGA.

01:41.467 --> 01:42.467
MY HONEY.

01:42.467 --> 01:44.667
MAY I CALL YOU HONEY?

01:44.667 --> 01:45.667
NO.

01:45.667 --> 01:47.700
TOPANGA...

01:47.700 --> 01:49.100
MY GIRL.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.500
MY FRIEND.

01:50.500 --> 01:53.967
MY GIRLIE FRIEND.

01:53.967 --> 01:56.367
I DON'T WANT THIS
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO,

01:56.367 --> 01:58.133
BUT EVERYBODY'S
PAIRING OFF.

01:58.133 --> 02:00.767
WE SHOULD SPARE OURSELVES
A LOT OF UNCOOLNESS

02:00.767 --> 02:02.600
AND WALK THROUGH LIFE
TOGETHER.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.600
CORY, MY DEAR LITTLE
BUTTHEAD.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.900
MAY I CALL YOU BUTTHEAD?

02:06.900 --> 02:08.300
SURE.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.200
I CAN'T
WALK THROUGH LIFE
WITH YOU.

02:10.200 --> 02:11.734
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?

02:11.734 --> 02:13.100
THERE'S EVERYBODY ELSE.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.700
WHY? WE'RE ALREADY
STANDING TOGETHER,

02:15.700 --> 02:18.200
AND WE LOOK GREAT.

02:20.767 --> 02:23.800
OH, COME ON.
WORK WITH ME HERE.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.600
WHEN GUYS AND GIRLS
GO OUT,

02:25.600 --> 02:28.100
FIRST THEY FALL
PASSIONATELY IN LOVE.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.700
THEN AFTER A WEEK,
THEY HATE EACH OTHER.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.800
SO FOR ONE GREAT,
PASSIONATE WEEK,

02:32.800 --> 02:34.867
WE'D LOSE
A LIFETIME FRIENDSHIP.

02:34.867 --> 02:36.800
I'M IN IF YOU ARE.

02:36.800 --> 02:38.033
CORY, DON'T WORRY.

02:38.033 --> 02:42.600
I'M SURE THERE'S
SOMEONE OUT THERE
FOR YOU.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.000
GIVE ME A NAME!

02:46.200 --> 02:48.667
FOR THE RECORD,
<i>I </i>DUMPED<i>HER.</i>

02:48.667 --> 02:51.200
THAT'S HOW I SAW IT.

02:53.100 --> 02:54.834
WELL,
DUBEN'S OUT SICK AGAIN.

02:54.834 --> 02:56.934
HEALTH TEACHER
SICK AGAIN?

02:56.934 --> 02:58.400
NOT A LOT
OF CREDIBILITY.

02:58.400 --> 03:03.133
I WONDER WHAT KIND
OF CREEPY SUBSTITUTE
WE GOT TODAY.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.867
WOW.

03:08.400 --> 03:13.367
THAT IS NO SUBSTITUTE.
THAT IS THE REAL THING.

03:13.367 --> 03:14.767
GOOD AFTERNOON, CLASS.
I'M MS. KELLY.

03:14.767 --> 03:18.467
I'LL BE FILLING IN
FOR MR. DUBEN
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

03:18.467 --> 03:22.000
ON BEHALF OF
THE ENTIRE CLASS,
I'D LIKE TO SAY,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.767
STAY AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

03:24.767 --> 03:27.867
NOW, RIGHT NOW,
YOU SEEM TO BE COVERING--

03:27.867 --> 03:30.400
CPR--AND I'M TODAY'S
DUMMY.

03:30.400 --> 03:34.967
NO. ACTUALLY,
WE SEEM TO BE UP TO
HUMAN REPRODUCTION,

03:34.967 --> 03:39.033
WHICH I HOPE
WE CAN DISCUSS
IN A MATURE FASHION.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.033
[GIGGLING]

03:40.033 --> 03:43.400
OH, STOP BEING SO YOUNG.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.233
I'M NOT AS YOUNG
AS THEY ARE.

03:46.233 --> 03:48.767
I'VE STAYED BACK,
LIKE, 50 TIMES.

03:48.767 --> 03:50.500
REALLY.
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

03:50.500 --> 03:51.800
24?

03:51.800 --> 03:56.567
REALLY?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN
A 7th-GRADE CLASSROOM?

03:56.567 --> 04:00.066
I'M A COP.

04:00.066 --> 04:01.834
SIT DOWN.

04:01.834 --> 04:03.400
ALL RIGHT, BUT...

04:03.400 --> 04:05.867
I'M WATCHING YOU.

04:07.100 --> 04:10.900
WHO CAN TELL US
THE NAME OF THE ORGAN

04:10.900 --> 04:12.767
WHERE THE EGGS ARE STORED?

04:12.767 --> 04:13.934
OFFICER?

04:13.934 --> 04:16.867
SORRY, MS. KELLY.
I DON'T HAVE
THAT STUFF.

04:16.867 --> 04:21.200
I CAN NAME THE STUFF
I HAVE.

04:21.200 --> 04:24.734
OR AT LEAST
WHAT I CALL THEM.

04:24.734 --> 04:28.400
THE NAME OF THE PLACE
WHERE THE EGGS ARE STORED.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.700
WHAT ARE THE GONADS?

04:30.700 --> 04:33.300
NO, SORRY.
I WAS LOOKING FOR,

04:33.300 --> 04:35.400
"WHAT ARE THE OVARIES?"

04:35.400 --> 04:36.400
OH, THE O--

04:36.400 --> 04:38.500
YEAH, I ALWAYS
MIX THOSE TWO UP.

04:38.500 --> 04:40.934
TRY NOT TO.
YOUR FUTURE
WILL BE BRIGHTER.

04:40.934 --> 04:44.300
CAN YOU TELL US
ANYTHING
ABOUT OVULATION

04:44.300 --> 04:45.667
OR HOW PREGNANCY OCCURS?

04:45.667 --> 04:48.767
THE MAN'S GOT THE SPERM,
AND THE WOMAN'S GOT THE EGG.

04:48.767 --> 04:52.400
ONCE A MONTH,
AN EGG SLIDES DOWN
THE PHILIPPINE TUBE

04:52.400 --> 04:53.467
TOWARDS THE UTERUS.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.100
THE FIRST SPERM
TO REACH THE EGG WINS.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.300
IT GETS A MEDAL,
IT'S BORN,
YOU NAME HIM CORY,

04:59.300 --> 05:00.400
PUSH HIM OUT THE DOOR,

05:00.400 --> 05:02.700
AND NOTHING MAKES SENSE
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

05:02.700 --> 05:07.000
YOU SEEM TO HAVE
A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING
OF THE LIFE CYCLE.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.934
HEY, I LIVE IT.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.934
ANY QUESTIONS?

05:11.934 --> 05:13.700
YES?

05:16.467 --> 05:21.233
HOW DO YOU GET A GIRL
TO SAY HI?

05:23.934 --> 05:27.033
MICHAEL AND LISA-MARIE?

05:27.033 --> 05:28.500
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.500
SINCE WHEN?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.467
JUST NOW.
THAT WAS IT.

05:31.467 --> 05:32.467
WHAT, THAT?

05:32.467 --> 05:34.100
YEAH.
YOU SAW IT HAPPEN.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.467
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

05:35.467 --> 05:39.600
I SAW IT HAPPEN,
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENS.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.834
STOP OBSESSING.
YOU'RE GOING TO
POP A LOBE.

05:42.834 --> 05:44.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I SHOULD RELAX.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.400
THIS COUPLING THING,
IT'S JUST A PHASE.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.600
HOW LONG CAN IT LAST,
A FEW WEEKS?

05:48.600 --> 05:49.867
THE CAFETERIA'S RIGHT HERE.

05:49.867 --> 05:52.500
THEY KNOW ME.
I'LL GET US A GOOD TABLE.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.200
YOU WOULD DO THAT
FOR ME?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.800
I'M VERY TIGHT
WITH BERTHA,
THE LUNCHROOM LADY.

05:56.800 --> 05:59.667
I ONCE RESCUED A DOLPHIN
FROM HER HAIR NET.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.834
O.K., MAYBE IT'LL LAST
A FEW YEARS.

06:02.834 --> 06:05.667
YES, I'M ACTING
PRINCIPAL NOW.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.900
AND THE PRESSURES
WOULD BE DAUNTING

06:07.900 --> 06:10.233
FOR A MAN
HALF MY AGE.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.467
FORTUNATELY,
I HAVE A VITALITY

06:12.467 --> 06:15.300
THAT BELIES MY YEARS.

06:15.300 --> 06:18.600
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
HOW IT'S DONE.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.400
I THINK
I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT KIND OF WORKS.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.400
WHAT?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.600
THIS.

06:25.734 --> 06:28.300
HI, SHAWN.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.400
WOW.
FROM ACROSS THE HALL.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.233
YEP. I GOT
A 30-FOOT RANGE.

06:33.233 --> 06:35.233
WHAT, YOU JUST
JERK YOUR HEAD?

06:35.233 --> 06:37.233
WATCH AGAIN.
I'M STILL YOUNG ENOUGH

06:37.233 --> 06:41.033
I CAN DO THIS
TWICE IN A ROW.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.100
SHAWN, IT'S SO STRANGE.

06:42.100 --> 06:44.967
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

06:44.967 --> 06:48.400
AND THAT'S WITHOUT
CONDITIONER.

07:01.600 --> 07:04.133
CORY, WHAT IS IT?

07:04.133 --> 07:06.700
YOU WERE JUST
DRAWN TO ME,
WEREN'T YOU?

07:06.700 --> 07:10.800
NO, I THOUGHT
YOU HAD HEAD LICE.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.000
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:12.000 --> 07:13.667
YEAH, I'M GREAT.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.300
OH, GOOD.

07:15.300 --> 07:16.367
HI, TOPANGA.

07:16.367 --> 07:19.734
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT YOU.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.767
I NEED NEW HAIR.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.700
HI, MOM.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.300
THIS IS REBECCA.
IT'S A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.767
DON'T SAY ANYTHING
TOO EMBARRASSING.

07:33.767 --> 07:37.033
HI, REBECCA.
HE WET HIS BED
TILL HE WAS 12.

07:37.033 --> 07:38.834
WHOOPS.

07:40.300 --> 07:41.967
WANT TO SIT?

07:41.967 --> 07:44.133
WEASEL, MOVE YOUR STUFF
OFF THE TABLE.

07:44.133 --> 07:46.767
WE GOT TO CRAM
FOR THE MATH TEST
TOMORROW.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.600
MY NAME'S NOT WEASEL.
IT'S MORGAN.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.233
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED IT
WHEN I CALLED YOU
WEASEL.

07:51.233 --> 07:52.567
I'VE NEVER LIKED IT.

07:52.567 --> 07:55.700
YOU LIKE IT SO MUCH,
IT'S YOUR NAME NOW--
WEASEL.

07:55.700 --> 07:59.100
WHAT AN ASSERTIVE
LITTLE SISTER YOU HAVE.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.300
OH, IT'S THE UNIFORM.

08:00.300 --> 08:03.600
WHEN SHE TAKES IF OFF,
SHE HAS A
VULNERABLE SIDE.

08:03.600 --> 08:05.000
O.K., MORGAN,
SOCCER PRACTICE.

08:05.000 --> 08:07.500
REMEMBER WHAT
WE LEARNED LAST WEEK?

08:07.500 --> 08:10.000
DON'T KICK THE COACH.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.000
BEFORE WE GET STARTED,
WHY DON'T WE
TAKE A BREAK?

08:14.000 --> 08:15.300
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

08:15.300 --> 08:19.100
I GOT FULL ACCESS
TO ALL THE MAJOR
KITCHEN APPLIANCES.

08:19.100 --> 08:21.000
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SHOW ME
YOUR HOUSE FIRST?

08:23.867 --> 08:25.867
YOU WANT TO SEE
THE HOUSE?

08:25.867 --> 08:29.600
SURE.
THIS IS THE HOUSE.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.100
ARE THERE
ANY OTHER ROOMS?

08:31.100 --> 08:34.133
UH, YEAH,
THERE'S PROBABLY ONE
RIGHT THOUGH HERE.

08:34.133 --> 08:35.367
DO YOU WANT TO...

08:35.367 --> 08:37.600
ALL RIGHT.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.867
HEY, I WAS RIGHT.

08:38.867 --> 08:40.867
THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM.

08:40.867 --> 08:42.200
THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE.

08:42.200 --> 08:47.000
THIS IS THE COUCH
WHERE MUCH OF THE SITTING
TAKES PLACE.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.033
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO SHOW ME
THE, UH, UPSTAIRS?

08:52.033 --> 08:54.133
YEAH, BOY, YEAH, BOY,
YEAH, BOY.

08:54.133 --> 08:55.300
I LOVE THE UPSTAIRS.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.400
WE WEREN'T EVEN GOING
TO HAVE AN UPSTAIRS,

08:57.400 --> 09:00.967
BUT I MADE THEM
PUT IT IN BECAUSE
I KNEW YOU WERE COMING.

09:00.967 --> 09:04.100
NOBODY TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS GIRL THING.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.600
I THOUGHT THEY WERE
JUST THERE.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.867
I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE INTERACTIVE.

09:09.867 --> 09:12.133
YOU'LL GET
THE HANG OF IT.

09:12.133 --> 09:15.400
SURE, IT'S EASY FOR YOU.
YOUR HAIR MOVES.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.867
THERE'S
OTHER TECHNIQUES.

09:16.867 --> 09:17.867
LIKE WHAT?

09:17.867 --> 09:19.767
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST DO HAIR.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.500
WHERE DO I GET
<i>MY </i>TECHNIQUE?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.800
ASK YOUR BROTHER.
HE'S GOT THE BOOM.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.100
LET'S JUST FORGET
THIS WHOLE SUBJECT.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.033
THERE ARE A MILLION
OTHER THINGS TO DO.

09:30.033 --> 09:33.500
WE'RE TOO YOUNG
TO WORRY ABOUT
FINDING MATES.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.000
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SEE YA.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.567
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

09:36.567 --> 09:38.500
I'M OFF TO MEET GIRLS.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.867
I'VE GOT A 30-FOOT RANGE.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.200
[GIRL]
IS THAT YOU, SHAWN?

09:43.200 --> 09:45.100
GET OUT.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.100
FINE.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.300
NO GIRLS FOR ME.

09:47.300 --> 09:50.567
I'LL JUST STUDY,
GET GOOD GRADES,
GET SMART,

09:50.567 --> 09:52.600
AND BECOME
A FAMOUS SCIENTIST,

09:52.600 --> 09:56.800

18:57.567 --> 18:58.900
I'M REALLY, REALLY SOR--

18:58.900 --> 19:01.700
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS,
FATHERS HAVE SAID
TO THEIR SONS,

19:01.700 --> 19:05.300
"DON'T RUSH INTO SEX,"
AND THE SONS
HAVE ALWAYS SAID,

19:05.300 --> 19:06.400
"YEAH, SURE, O.K."

19:06.400 --> 19:08.700
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
MY FATHER TILL NOW.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.100
YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND ME
TILL YOU'RE A FATHER,

19:11.100 --> 19:13.033
WHICH WON'T BE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME!

19:13.033 --> 19:14.033
DAD--

19:14.033 --> 19:16.000
LEARN HER NAME!
AS FOR YOU--

19:16.000 --> 19:18.200
REBECCA.
HER NAME WAS REBECCA.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.233
IS THAT ALL
YOU KNOW ABOUT HER?

19:20.233 --> 19:22.467
NOT TOO MUCH MORE,
I GUESS.

19:22.467 --> 19:24.300
DOES THAT MAKE YOU
FEEL GOOD?

19:24.300 --> 19:25.300
NO.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.567
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

19:26.567 --> 19:30.300
LET YOUR BRAIN IN
ON WHAT THE REST OF YOU
IS DOING.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.867
ARE YOU TWO
BOTH CLEAR ON THIS?

19:32.867 --> 19:34.600
IF I CAN'T USE
ERIC'S METHOD,

19:34.600 --> 19:36.867
HOW DO I
GET A GIRL
TO SAY HI?

19:36.867 --> 19:38.300
CORY.
YEAH?

19:38.300 --> 19:40.200
WHAT DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT GIRLS

19:40.200 --> 19:42.133
BEFORE YOUR BROTHER'S
EXCELLENT ADVICE?

19:42.133 --> 19:44.367
I DIDN'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

19:44.367 --> 19:47.800
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO WITH THAT?

19:57.100 --> 19:58.667
UM, READY TO GO?

19:58.667 --> 20:03.400
LOOK, ARE YOU FEELING
A LITTLE FUNNY
ABOUT THIS?

20:03.400 --> 20:06.100
YOU MEAN
ABOUT GOING OUT
ON A DATE?

20:06.100 --> 20:10.100
YEAH. BECAUSE
WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.400
A LITTLE FUNNY.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.000
SO DO YOU WANT TO,
LIKE,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.100
NOT GO OUT
ON A DATE?

20:16.100 --> 20:18.400
YEAH. IT DOESN'T
FEEL RIGHT.

20:18.400 --> 20:19.734
I UNDERSTAND.

20:19.734 --> 20:22.000
WE SHOULD STILL
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.233
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

20:23.233 --> 20:27.200
BECAUSE THEN
IN CASE WE EVER DID
WANT TO GO OUT...

20:27.200 --> 20:28.467
WE'D KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:28.467 --> 20:32.100
SO, UM, HOW DO YOU
WANT TO GET TO KNOW
EACH OTHER?

20:32.100 --> 20:34.867
WELL, WE COULD
GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK,

20:34.867 --> 20:37.467
IF YOU DON'T HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO.

20:39.300 --> 20:41.000
WELL, I DID,

20:41.000 --> 20:44.100
BUT, UM,
NOW I'M SUDDENLY FREE.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.300
GREAT. LET'S GO.

20:48.500 --> 20:52.200
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

20:52.200 --> 20:56.600
WELL, UM,
DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

20:56.600 --> 20:58.300
UH...

20:58.300 --> 21:00.767
IT'S WENDY.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.834
WENDY.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.400
WENDY?

21:07.400 --> 21:08.667
YEAH?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.200
HI.

21:10.200 --> 21:11.400
HI.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.133
LOT OF HOMEWORK?

21:23.133 --> 21:24.900
YEAH, A LOT.
YOU?

21:24.900 --> 21:28.033
YEAH.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.767
I KNOW
I'VE BEEN FORBIDDEN

21:29.767 --> 21:33.100
TO GIVE YOU
ANY ADVICE
ON ANY SUBJECT,

21:33.100 --> 21:34.700
SO IF THERE'S
ANY INFORMATION

21:34.700 --> 21:37.600
YOU'D LIKE TO VOLUNTARILY
OFFER ABOUT YOUR LIFE,
I'M LISTENING.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.200
HOW WAS MY DATE?

21:39.200 --> 21:40.200
YEAH.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.400
I HAD
A REAL GOOD TIME.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.500
WHAT WAS YOUR TECHNIQUE?

21:43.500 --> 21:47.100
LOOK, I KNOW YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT WOMEN,

21:47.100 --> 21:48.967
AND I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING.

21:48.967 --> 21:51.200
SO I DID
WHAT I DO BEST.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.967
I WAS REAL NERVOUS,
AND I NODDED A LOT.

21:54.967 --> 21:56.200
DID SHE LIKE THAT?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.734
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHEN I ASKED HER

21:58.734 --> 22:01.500
IF SHE WANTED
TO GO OUT AGAIN,

22:01.500 --> 22:03.400
SHE SAID,
"YEAH, I WOULD."

22:03.400 --> 22:04.900
COOL.

22:04.900 --> 22:05.934
COR?

22:05.934 --> 22:06.934
YEAH.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.700
SO HOW DID YOU NOD?

22:08.700 --> 22:12.300
I MEAN, WAS IT
LIKE THIS, OR...

22:12.300 --> 22:15.834
[LAUGHING]
