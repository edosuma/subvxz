00:14.181 --> 00:16.168
(Chuckles) Good morning.

00:16.169 --> 00:17.625
Good morning.

00:18.443 --> 00:20.554
So I guess we finally did it, huh?

00:21.144 --> 00:23.015
(Chuckles) Sure did.

00:24.070 --> 00:25.406
It was nice, right?

00:26.200 --> 00:27.379
Very.

00:29.332 --> 00:30.872
I'm glad we took it slow.

00:32.012 --> 00:33.613
Yeah, me too.

00:34.822 --> 00:38.755
But I wouldn't mind it
if, for the next sleepover,

00:38.756 --> 00:41.486
we lose the clothes and the baby.

00:43.346 --> 00:45.299
Good morning, Emma.

00:46.496 --> 00:48.281

01:01.076 --> 01:02.864
- Oh.
- Hi, morning.

01:02.865 --> 01:04.489
Sorry, I didn't know you were here.

01:04.489 --> 01:05.808
Nothing happened.

01:05.809 --> 01:08.417
I just slept over. Like, as in sleep.

01:09.579 --> 01:10.965
Whatever. (Laughs)

01:10.966 --> 01:12.438
It's cool. I'm fine.

01:12.439 --> 01:13.751
Why wouldn't I be fine?

01:13.752 --> 01:14.855
You and Ben, Ben and you...

01:14.856 --> 01:16.351
Just like a dream come true.

01:17.486 --> 01:18.796
Oh. Okay, good.

01:18.797 --> 01:20.312
Oh, my God, that's really good.

01:20.313 --> 01:21.931
I'm glad that we can talk about this,

01:21.932 --> 01:23.742
'cause I would just, you know,

01:23.743 --> 01:25.729
hate for things to be awkward between us.

01:25.730 --> 01:28.890
Oh, not awkward at all.

01:28.891 --> 01:30.744
Talk away.

01:30.745 --> 01:32.917
Okay. Great.

01:32.918 --> 01:36.234
Well, last night ended
up just being so sweet.

01:36.235 --> 01:37.661
And Ben was so romantic.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.780
Good talk. I gotta go.

01:40.645 --> 01:42.541
I'm late for the... bye.

01:43.582 --> 01:46.112
<i>- (Door opens, slams)
- Morning.</i>

01:46.561 --> 01:48.984
- Everything okay?
- Super!

01:49.729 --> 01:51.951
Not awkward at all.

01:52.675 --> 01:54.703
So glad that you're still here, Angela,

01:54.704 --> 01:56.525
which also isn't awkward.

01:57.731 --> 02:00.257
I can't believe I have an
apartment filled with women

02:00.258 --> 02:01.893
and none of them are mine.

02:03.419 --> 02:05.848
Thanks for letting me
stay on the couch, again.

02:05.849 --> 02:07.422
Oh, hey, it's no problem.

02:07.423 --> 02:08.919
Hey, she don't live here.

02:10.976 --> 02:12.687
I promise I'll find my own place soon.

02:12.688 --> 02:14.548
I so hate getting in the way of things.

02:14.549 --> 02:15.630
Really?

02:16.978 --> 02:19.049
But you know what? It's totally fine.

02:19.050 --> 02:21.253
You just stay as long as you like.

02:21.254 --> 02:23.348
Again, not really her decision.

02:25.247 --> 02:27.049
Well, I'll try and clear out tonight.

02:27.050 --> 02:29.492
Oh, you know, no need.
We won't even be here.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.317
We have a very special evening planned.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.418
Is this thing even on? What?

02:36.197 --> 02:37.354
(Door opens)

02:37.355 --> 02:38.791
Hey, I remember you.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.009
Morning. I made coffee.

02:41.010 --> 02:45.917
Hi, baby. Oh, I forgot how
cute you look when you wake up.

02:45.918 --> 02:48.738
- Isn't she adorable?
- I was actually talking about you.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.461
(Clears throat)

02:54.299 --> 02:56.371
This is really good coffee.

02:57.152 --> 02:58.694
(Chuckles) Well, while you enjoy it,

02:58.695 --> 03:01.614
I'm going to go get
our little girl dressed.

03:02.444 --> 03:04.147
(Whispers)

03:05.309 --> 03:07.176
And something tells me

03:07.177 --> 03:10.582
she's coming back to get you undressed.

03:12.285 --> 03:14.971
Okay, so it's not just me.
She was just flirting, right?

03:14.972 --> 03:17.368
Flirting? Dude, she made you coffee

03:17.369 --> 03:19.489
and she did this to your hair,

03:19.973 --> 03:21.447
just all around.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.587
In some cultures, you'd be engaged.

03:26.647 --> 03:28.322
What am I supposed to do, man?

03:28.323 --> 03:29.626
I mean, I guess I could sit her down,

03:29.627 --> 03:32.323
have a heart to heart, and tell
her it's never gonna happen.

03:32.324 --> 03:33.717
Or I could just avoid her.

03:35.142 --> 03:38.691
Ben, Angela is like the mold in our shower.

03:38.692 --> 03:42.604
You can ignore it, but it
just ain't going away, man.

03:44.186 --> 03:45.876
Really? 'Cause our shower looks great.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.630
Because I just cleaned it!

03:48.867 --> 03:50.810
Okay, just one more for my ex-husband.

03:50.811 --> 03:52.584
- Okay.
- (Camera clicks)

03:53.679 --> 03:55.444
- So, bon bon.
- Yeah?

03:55.445 --> 03:58.190
Third date and still I really
don't know that much about you,

03:58.931 --> 04:01.739
other than you don't
wait until the third date.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.514
(Both laugh)

04:03.515 --> 04:06.338
Well, you know, I'm
pretty much an open book...

04:06.705 --> 04:11.312
Just your average 31-year-old
air France flight attendant.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.726
Well, a good realtor knows when to close.

04:15.727 --> 04:17.975
- Okay.
- And to shower.

04:18.761 --> 04:21.026
Hey, who are these guys?

04:21.027 --> 04:23.748
Oh! Oh, them? They just
came with the frame.

04:23.749 --> 04:26.173
Ah. Well, I gotta get going.

04:26.174 --> 04:28.089
I got a ton of apartments to show today.

04:28.090 --> 04:31.071
No rest for Brad the pad.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.395
- (Mimics gunshot)
- Ooh! You got me. (Gasps)

04:33.960 --> 04:35.751
(Sighs)

04:37.203 --> 04:40.263
- Morning, mom.
- (Stammers) Shh! Shh!

04:40.264 --> 04:42.814
Keep your "mom" down.
What are you doing here?

04:42.815 --> 04:45.346
Sorry, my apartment's a
little sexually charged.

04:46.165 --> 04:47.860
Hey, whose pants are these?

04:48.576 --> 04:51.029
- A friend's.
- Oh, my God.

04:51.030 --> 04:52.457
Your place is charged too!

04:54.468 --> 04:56.678
I have nothing to apologize for.

04:57.034 --> 04:59.490
I am a vibrant, very young woman!

05:00.186 --> 05:02.980
I know. You've told me an
uncomfortable amount of times.

05:03.789 --> 05:05.301
- Where am I supposed to get breakfast?
- I don't know.

05:05.302 --> 05:06.818
A cafe, restaurant, coffee cart...

05:06.819 --> 05:08.217
You passed all three on your way here.

05:08.765 --> 05:11.777
- I don't have any shoes.
- Okay, here, take mine.

05:12.087 --> 05:14.859
They'll be a little big, but
you can stuff paper in 'em.

05:14.860 --> 05:16.482
Hey, why don't you want
me to meet this guy?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.364
Well, there's just a few
things we haven't discussed yet.

05:18.365 --> 05:20.221
- Like what?
- Like your existence and my real age,

05:20.222 --> 05:22.776
so just go go go go go go go go go go!

05:25.749 --> 05:27.542
Two of the smartest words to
ever come out of your mouth...

05:27.543 --> 05:28.818
To go.

05:32.798 --> 05:34.178
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

05:34.179 --> 05:36.890
- All right, you got it?
- Hang on. Almost there.

05:36.891 --> 05:39.408
<i>- (Cellphone ringing)
- Don't answer that.</i>

05:39.409 --> 05:40.942
No way. Not gonna happen.

05:42.518 --> 05:44.542
What if it's... Doesn't matter.

05:44.543 --> 05:46.004
- Ignore it.
- Yeah. You bet.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.701
(Moans)

05:48.702 --> 05:50.526
- Oh, it's Angela.
- Of course it is.

05:50.527 --> 05:51.958
- Let me... let me just for one second.
- (Beeps)

05:51.959 --> 05:53.383
Hey, what's up?

05:53.827 --> 05:55.779
Oh, my God, how bad is it?

05:56.237 --> 05:57.640
Okay okay okay, don't worry.

05:57.641 --> 05:59.061
I'll be there in a second.

05:59.423 --> 06:01.137
Riley, I'm so so sorry.

06:01.138 --> 06:02.315
- I have to go.
- Go.

06:02.316 --> 06:03.672
Look, I promise I will make this up to you.

06:08.206 --> 06:09.719
(Sighs)

06:13.245 --> 06:14.899
So do you wanna come in?

06:14.900 --> 06:17.172
I don't think my parents are home.

06:21.981 --> 06:25.693
- What's wrong?
- Oh, there's a giant mess in my apartment...

06:26.062 --> 06:28.003
One that I really regret making.

06:28.603 --> 06:30.912
Uh, so could I just get a rain check?

06:30.913 --> 06:34.007
Do you have a guy in there?
You're not two-timing me, are you?

06:34.008 --> 06:37.017
Oh, honey, I can barely one-time you.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.199
(Laughs) All right, so I'll call you.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.284
- I promise, all right?
- Okay.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.488
- (Mimics gunshots)
- Ah, you got... Ow ow ow ah!

06:47.353 --> 06:50.284
- Hi, mom.
- Danny, you have to stop coming over here.

06:50.761 --> 06:53.695
And quit eating my good cheese
puffs. Those are for company.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.141
I'm sorry. Was that the pants guy again?

06:57.477 --> 06:59.926
God, I'm just surrounded
by new relationships

06:59.927 --> 07:02.089
and happiness. Gross!

07:02.727 --> 07:04.207
Honey, you're Danny Wheeler.

07:04.752 --> 07:07.954
Every girl wants to be in a new
relationship and be gross with you.

07:10.131 --> 07:11.478
I can't believe they're together.

07:14.356 --> 07:15.834
Oh, honey.

07:16.579 --> 07:18.617
I know how hard this must be for you.

07:19.327 --> 07:22.219
But I promise you you won't be sad forever.

07:22.772 --> 07:24.187
You'll move on.

07:24.823 --> 07:26.318
And, sweetie, you have to,

07:26.319 --> 07:28.124
otherwise you are never gonna be happy.

07:29.593 --> 07:30.940
I love you.

07:33.743 --> 07:35.906
Danny, you're getting cheese
dust all over my dress.

07:37.277 --> 07:39.278
Sorry. But you're right.

07:39.736 --> 07:41.091
I know you're right.

07:42.325 --> 07:43.916
Tell me about your guy.

07:43.917 --> 07:47.992
Okay. This is him, Brad the pad on a pad.

07:49.174 --> 07:51.626
New York's #1 realtor.

07:53.229 --> 07:55.051
- That's what I need.
- Oh, honey, I don't think

07:55.052 --> 07:56.480
a younger man will fix your problems.

07:58.590 --> 08:00.870
No, you said it yourself...
I need to move on.

08:00.871 --> 08:02.475
I need to get my own place.

08:02.476 --> 08:03.994
Will you call him for me?

08:03.995 --> 08:05.728
Okay, so you want me to call my boyfriend

08:05.729 --> 08:08.176
who thinks I'm all of 30 and say,

08:08.177 --> 08:11.319
"hey, Brad, my 20-something
son needs an apartment.

08:11.320 --> 08:12.630
Can you help him out?"

08:13.881 --> 08:15.629
Yeah, that'd be perfect!

08:17.872 --> 08:20.713
Okay, she's finally asleep,
and I think it was just gas.

08:20.714 --> 08:23.822
Sorry if she scared you. She gets
her scream from her grandmother.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.308
(Laughs) My hero.

08:26.309 --> 08:28.065
- (Laughs)
- If I recall, Ben Wheeler,

08:28.066 --> 08:30.320
you've always been pretty
good at putting girls to bed.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.573
Oh, look, it's Tucker!

08:34.573 --> 08:36.667
Tucker's home! Yay, Tucker!

08:37.239 --> 08:38.495
Oh, hey, guys.

08:40.139 --> 08:41.866
What's going on?

08:43.092 --> 08:45.932
- There was something wrong with Emma.
- Oh, was there?

08:47.032 --> 08:50.732
- Angela called to tell me.
- Oh, did she?

08:50.733 --> 08:52.788
- Turns out it was just gas.
- Oh, was it?

08:54.542 --> 08:56.728
Well, I'm gonna go to bed now...

08:57.164 --> 08:58.693
In my room...

08:58.694 --> 09:00.995
Where I can hear everything.

09:04.035 --> 09:06.687
Is everything okay?
Things feel a little weird.

09:06.688 --> 09:08.445
Yeah yeah yeah. No no, nothing's weird.

09:09.541 --> 09:11.896
- I mean, yeah, a little weird.
- (Sighs)

09:12.445 --> 09:15.293
You have to admit, this
is a little uncomfortable.

09:15.294 --> 09:16.768
- Oh, my God, is it?
- (Laughs)

09:16.769 --> 09:19.157
I... I'm so sorry. I don't mean it to be.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.839
I just wish we could be open
and honest with each other.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.290
I wanna be able to talk to you.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.892
I wanna be able to talk to you, too.

09:25.575 --> 09:27.394
I am a pretty good talker.

09:27.395 --> 09:28.699
I remember that about you.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.308
I also remember you
being pretty good at this.

09:35.875 --> 09:36.811
What are you doing?

09:36.812 --> 09:38.472
You can't do that. I have a girlfriend.

09:38.473 --> 09:41.339
I'm... I'm so sorry. I guess
I got my signals crossed.

09:41.340 --> 09:43.232
What signal? I didn't
signal. There was no signal!

09:44.889 --> 09:47.868
And from now on, we'll be
keeping our hands to ourselves.

09:48.247 --> 09:49.654
Well, if you say so.

09:49.655 --> 09:50.917
I'm gonna go check on the baby.

09:50.918 --> 09:52.567
Yeah, okay, you do that.

09:53.708 --> 09:54.950
(Scoffs)

10:00.937 --> 10:02.297
Told you.

10:03.434 --> 10:04.874
Yo, you saw that, right?

10:04.875 --> 10:06.968
She was the kisser. I was just the kissee.

10:06.969 --> 10:08.168
Oh, I saw it.

10:09.766 --> 10:12.501
Look, Ben, the question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

10:12.502 --> 10:13.576
What do you mean what
am I gonna do about it?

10:13.577 --> 10:14.910
- I just did it.
- When?

10:14.911 --> 10:16.280
Just now. You heard me.

10:16.281 --> 10:17.539
I was pretty clear...

10:17.540 --> 10:18.945
Hands off the merchandise,

10:18.946 --> 10:20.353
not for sale.

10:21.597 --> 10:23.858
Oh, that? Hell no, you gotta throw her out.

10:25.248 --> 10:26.531
(Silent)

10:27.192 --> 10:28.360
Gone.

10:29.653 --> 10:32.164
Tucker, I can't throw
her out. She's Emma's mom.

10:32.516 --> 10:34.306
But trust me, this won't happen again.

10:34.307 --> 10:36.490
I'm putting this whole
Angela-Ben thing to bed.

10:38.866 --> 10:40.250
You know what I meant.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.667
So far, I like this one the best.

10:46.549 --> 10:48.070
The other ones were kinda...

10:48.627 --> 10:50.138
- Murdery.
- Yeah.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.920
- Bonnie.
- Brad.

10:53.567 --> 10:54.763
What... what are you doing here?

10:54.764 --> 10:56.495
Working. What are you d...

10:56.496 --> 10:58.323
Hey, aren't you that guy
from the picture frame?

10:58.324 --> 11:00.605
I thought you said you didn't know him.

11:01.091 --> 11:04.487
- Uh...
- Danny. Danny flyoffski.

11:04.488 --> 11:05.844
I'm a pilot.

11:07.296 --> 11:09.645
Uh, yes yes, he is.

11:09.646 --> 11:11.495
He's one of my pilots.

11:11.930 --> 11:15.276
Who occasionally models for picture frames.

11:16.028 --> 11:17.447
He needs an apartment.

11:17.448 --> 11:20.856
Oh, you should've called me.
You're standing in a Brad pad.

11:20.857 --> 11:22.499
Hey, would you mind signing
in with my assistant?

11:22.500 --> 11:24.304
She's just in the kitchen.

11:24.305 --> 11:26.457
Yeah. (Laughing)

11:26.458 --> 11:28.099
No talking while I'm gone.

11:31.136 --> 11:33.958
Okay, seriously, who
the hell are you, anyway?

11:33.959 --> 11:38.242
Do we need to step outside? And if we
do, you mind not messing up the face?

11:38.758 --> 11:41.233
Dude, calm down. It's not like that.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.778
We've known each other
since we were kids...

11:43.645 --> 11:45.395
Well, one of us was.

11:46.154 --> 11:48.068
- Hey, how old are you?
- 35.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.830
Th-thirty...

11:51.831 --> 11:53.430
Fine! I'm 28...

11:53.738 --> 11:56.178
- Almost.
- What?

11:56.179 --> 11:58.663
You're only like two years older than me.

11:58.664 --> 12:00.014
(Laughs)

12:00.015 --> 12:03.299
Which is neither here nor there.

12:04.399 --> 12:06.238
I always wanted to say that.

12:07.947 --> 12:10.994
(Laughs) I signed in as "Anita sandwich."

12:10.995 --> 12:13.184
(Both laughing)

12:14.430 --> 12:16.587
- Yeah.
- Anita...

12:16.588 --> 12:18.394
You're so pretty.

12:18.999 --> 12:21.107
So, bon, what do you
say we get out of here?

12:21.108 --> 12:22.856
I've got the rest of the afternoon off.

12:22.857 --> 12:24.528
You're on your own, flabowski.

12:30.167 --> 12:31.369
Angela?

12:31.370 --> 12:33.068
What are you doing here?

12:33.069 --> 12:34.200
Remember this morning's meeting?

12:34.201 --> 12:35.905
Everybody has to be out
of the house tonight.

12:35.906 --> 12:37.788
Calm down, jumpy. I got the memo,

12:37.789 --> 12:39.819
but Tucker called. He
can't watch Emma tonight.

12:39.820 --> 12:41.411
Said something came up.

12:41.412 --> 12:42.819
What could have come up?

12:45.229 --> 12:46.568
All right, Emma.

12:49.082 --> 12:52.593
Operation remove Angela
has officially begun.

12:53.669 --> 12:55.282
Tucker? What's the emergency?

12:55.654 --> 12:57.193
Is everything okay?

12:57.194 --> 12:58.342
And more importantly,

12:58.343 --> 12:59.726
what are you wearing?

13:00.464 --> 13:02.023
Look, we're incognito.

13:03.212 --> 13:05.277
Well, I am. Emma's just cold.

13:05.895 --> 13:07.262
Look, there's something you need to see.

13:07.580 --> 13:09.840
- What is it?
- Oh, just a little show

13:09.841 --> 13:12.750
I like to call "Angela
is stealing your man."

13:14.753 --> 13:16.218
Binoculars?

13:19.919 --> 13:22.147
Okay, so let me get this straight.

13:22.148 --> 13:24.685
You're ruining my romantic
dinner with boyfriend

13:24.686 --> 13:26.565
so that you can set up
a fake romantic dinner

13:26.566 --> 13:28.115
with him and his ex to prove that

13:28.116 --> 13:29.494
she's trying to steal him

13:29.495 --> 13:31.545
so that I'll help you kick her out?

13:31.546 --> 13:32.693
Oh, good.

13:32.694 --> 13:34.537
I was afraid it was gonna
sound a little crazy.

13:35.832 --> 13:38.738
Tucker, what kind of a plan is that?

13:38.739 --> 13:40.307
Well, Ben won't get rid of her,

13:40.308 --> 13:42.013
even after the whole kiss thing.

13:45.243 --> 13:46.564
Kiss thing?!

13:47.261 --> 13:48.468
There was a kiss thing?

13:48.469 --> 13:49.535
When was there a kiss thing?

13:49.536 --> 13:52.151
Oh, now I've got your attention, don't I?

13:53.895 --> 13:55.046
He kissed her?

13:55.348 --> 13:56.891
No, she kissed him.

13:58.477 --> 14:00.178
And Ben thinks he set her straight,

14:00.179 --> 14:02.825
but she's not gonna stop
until she gets what she wants.

14:02.826 --> 14:04.734
And what she wants is Ben.

14:05.775 --> 14:07.415
Are you really gonna let that happen?

14:08.106 --> 14:10.920
I don't know. I mean, I trust Ben.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.362
And I can't start a new relationship if...

14:13.363 --> 14:16.033
<i>(Angela laughs)</i>

14:19.988 --> 14:22.378
- You have
sound? - Mm-hmm.

14:22.379 --> 14:23.803
- Shove over.
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.714 --> 14:28.430
Wow, Riley is running really late.

14:29.612 --> 14:31.179
Maybe I'll go wait for her in the hallway.

14:33.104 --> 14:34.299
Ooh, here she is...

14:34.666 --> 14:36.696
Saying that she's stuck at work.

14:36.697 --> 14:39.564
And it seems Tucker and
Emma are stuck on the subway.

14:40.845 --> 14:42.990
Be a real shame to let this get warm.

14:44.877 --> 14:47.101
I can't believe she's drinking my wine.

14:48.539 --> 14:52.126
I think you might be
focusing on the wrong thing.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.174
(Scoffs)

14:54.649 --> 14:57.316
Ben, are you sure you
don't want to join me?

14:58.644 --> 14:59.987
Hey, guys.

14:59.988 --> 15:01.368
Look! It's Danny!

15:01.369 --> 15:03.161
Danny's home. Yay, Danny.

15:03.537 --> 15:04.895
Why don't you come have
a glass of wine with us

15:04.896 --> 15:06.149
until Riley gets back?

15:06.150 --> 15:07.392
(Phone rings)

15:08.438 --> 15:09.767
Hello?

15:09.768 --> 15:11.172
Oh, hey, what's up?

15:11.493 --> 15:13.846
No, okay.

15:13.847 --> 15:16.221
I guess. You have
anything to eat over there?

15:16.222 --> 15:18.235
Okay. See you.

15:18.977 --> 15:20.696
Wh... wh... Who was that?

15:20.697 --> 15:22.417
Wrong number.

15:24.246 --> 15:25.768
And he said, honey,

15:25.769 --> 15:27.596
<i>my tray table isn't the only thing</i>

15:27.597 --> 15:29.197
in the upright position.

15:29.198 --> 15:30.817
(Both laugh)

15:31.881 --> 15:32.911
Both: Hey, Mrs. Wheeler.

15:33.877 --> 15:37.494
Hey, guys! (Laughs)

15:37.983 --> 15:39.047
Oh, man,

15:39.048 --> 15:41.698
don't tell me you were grounded again?

15:42.248 --> 15:44.706
What? I haven't been
grounded since I was like ten.

15:44.707 --> 15:46.301
(Forced laugh)

15:50.036 --> 15:52.171
Flight attendant humor...

15:52.172 --> 15:54.056
Because that's what we are,

15:54.358 --> 15:56.470
three flight attendants.

15:57.044 --> 16:00.240
So, besties, this is Brad.

16:00.685 --> 16:02.423
- Hi.
- My boyfriend.

16:02.424 --> 16:05.660
(Laughs)

16:09.036 --> 16:10.589
Oh, my God!

16:10.590 --> 16:12.533
Oh... oh, you're serious.

16:14.960 --> 16:19.460
Brad, sit down and I'm gonna
get you a bottle of wine, okay?

16:19.461 --> 16:21.403
All right, what the hell
are you two doing here?!

16:21.404 --> 16:22.576
We're spying on Ben.

16:22.577 --> 16:25.019
- What?
- We're waiting for Angela to hit on him.

16:25.020 --> 16:27.036
Hey, whose baby is this?

16:27.037 --> 16:28.416
Both: She's mine.

16:29.705 --> 16:31.454
- Ours.
- Ours.

16:34.720 --> 16:36.236
We're in love.

16:41.072 --> 16:42.538
Great, yeah. I can move in tomorrow.

16:42.539 --> 16:44.677
Thanks. I got the place.

16:44.678 --> 16:46.442
Dan the man is moving out.

16:46.443 --> 16:48.308
Moving out? Bonnie, you two live together?

16:48.309 --> 16:49.373
No, you can't move out.

16:49.374 --> 16:50.593
You have to give me two weeks' notice.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.005
Danny, why would you move out?

16:52.006 --> 16:53.431
Is this because of me and Ben?

16:53.432 --> 16:55.455
No, it's Tucker.

16:55.456 --> 16:57.870
Dude, seriously, I'm sorry.

16:59.557 --> 17:02.525
Hey, you guys, why don't
you go over to your new place

17:02.526 --> 17:04.839
and you can all sort it out there, huh?

17:04.839 --> 17:06.888
They told me to come here so
that they could spy on Ben.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.631
Bonnie, what the hell is going on?

17:09.444 --> 17:10.662
Fine!

17:11.685 --> 17:13.361
They're not my flight crew.

17:14.198 --> 17:15.962
The big one is my kid.

17:15.963 --> 17:17.965
And these two little ones are his friends.

17:20.059 --> 17:22.330
Yeah, and the super little
one's her granddaughter.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.679
I hate you.

17:24.564 --> 17:26.344
So, she's... she's your kid?

17:26.345 --> 17:28.372
No, I have a brother. She's his kid.

17:28.373 --> 17:30.235
How many kids do you have?

17:30.236 --> 17:32.767
After today, zero.

17:33.264 --> 17:35.044
Oh, my God, you've got to be at least 40...

17:35.045 --> 17:37.178
Ah, LA LA LA LA LA!

17:38.948 --> 17:40.969
Hey, people, can we take it down a notch?

17:40.970 --> 17:42.334
It is getting good over here.

17:42.335 --> 17:44.768
<i>Angela: Ben, it's no secret
that I really like you.</i>

17:45.258 --> 17:47.654
<i>I can't help feeling
the way I feel about you.</i>

17:48.473 --> 17:50.373
And I think you feel something too.

17:51.316 --> 17:53.453
Angela, I'm with Riley.

17:53.454 --> 17:54.738
She's my girl.

17:57.168 --> 17:58.565
That's my guy.

17:59.907 --> 18:01.612
But what if there was no Riley?

18:02.324 --> 18:04.027
What if it was just you and me?

18:04.810 --> 18:06.495
You think we might have a chance?

18:06.859 --> 18:08.128
(Sighs)

18:08.129 --> 18:09.142
Don't answer, Ben.

18:09.143 --> 18:10.127
Do not answer that.

18:10.128 --> 18:11.728
- Answer it.
- No, don't!

18:15.042 --> 18:16.968
What? I'm invested.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.202
Well, I mean, you are Emma's mom,

18:22.203 --> 18:24.060
and we did make her together...

18:24.061 --> 18:26.002
Which wasn't completely terrible.

18:26.003 --> 18:27.151
<i>(Angela chuckles)</i>

18:27.152 --> 18:30.346
So I guess if there was no Riley,

18:30.347 --> 18:32.610
then yes.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.958
- (Sighs)
- I'd try to see if we could make it work.

18:35.727 --> 18:37.224
<i>All: No!</i>

18:37.975 --> 18:39.147
What was that?

18:42.006 --> 18:43.837
(Muttering)

18:53.044 --> 18:54.234
<i>So since you obviously</i>

18:54.235 --> 18:55.722
saw that nothing happened,

18:55.723 --> 18:57.282
can we forget this ever happened?

19:00.544 --> 19:01.810
I wish I could.

19:02.463 --> 19:03.979
No no no no. You can.

19:03.980 --> 19:05.157
It's really easy.

19:05.158 --> 19:06.582
I forget stuff all the time.

19:08.124 --> 19:09.268
I can't.

19:11.281 --> 19:14.176
Ben, I was in love with you

19:14.177 --> 19:17.010
before I even knew what love really was...

19:18.913 --> 19:22.044
You know, before I ever dreamed
that there could be an us.

19:25.668 --> 19:28.147
And that's why I know
this just isn't right.

19:29.724 --> 19:31.085
What are you talking about?

19:32.650 --> 19:35.244
You said yes, Ben.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.560
I watched the word come out of your mouth

19:37.919 --> 19:40.043
and I can't make it go away.

19:40.044 --> 19:42.058
But Angela said if you weren't here.

19:42.059 --> 19:43.032
It was a trick question

19:43.033 --> 19:44.176
because here you are.

19:44.177 --> 19:45.963
Yeah...

19:45.964 --> 19:47.140
But it lets me know

19:47.141 --> 19:49.032
that maybe you need to
see if it could work.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.089
But I want to be busy
seeing if you and I can work.

19:51.090 --> 19:55.266
Ben, if you and I are
ever gonna have something,

19:56.842 --> 19:59.301
you need to make sure that you and Angela

19:59.302 --> 20:00.914
have nothing.

20:02.499 --> 20:03.865
You owe it to yourself...

20:05.899 --> 20:07.425
And to Emma.

20:10.214 --> 20:11.356
(Sniffs)

20:13.534 --> 20:16.311
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

20:22.150 --> 20:23.558
(Exhales)

20:23.559 --> 20:25.835
Please stop me. Please stop me.

20:26.220 --> 20:28.255
<i>- (Elevator dings)
- Please stop me.</i>

20:32.437 --> 20:33.630
<i>(Dings)</i>

20:36.664 --> 20:38.151
Riley, wait!

20:40.598 --> 20:43.195
<i>(Emma cries)</i>

20:45.524 --> 20:48.680
Are you sure you saw our
beer in my mom's fridge?

20:48.681 --> 20:52.207
Yes, right next to my
leftover pasta from Dimitri's.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.889
And I know it was mine because the foil

20:53.890 --> 20:55.401
was in the shape of a "t."

20:55.866 --> 20:57.248
Dude, she's stealing from us,

20:57.249 --> 20:59.085
and I am gonna prove it.

20:59.656 --> 21:02.973
<i>Bonnie: Mmm, I just love leftover pasta.</i>

21:03.468 --> 21:05.652
Oh, I got you now, thief.

21:08.412 --> 21:10.708
Yeah, I steal your food.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.370
You want to do something about it?

21:12.751 --> 21:13.956
Nope, I'm good.
