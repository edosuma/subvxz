WEBVTT

00:04.212 --> 00:06.506
This is just too much.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.842
If I don’t see them being,
like, the father of my children,

00:08.883 --> 00:11.594
then, like, I just don’t see
the point of dating them.

00:15.056 --> 00:16.516
Nat’s just so confusing, man.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.268
She needs to decide
does she wanna be, like,

00:18.309 --> 00:19.853
a really good friend,
or does she wanna lie in bed

00:19.894 --> 00:22.022
and kiss all night?

00:22.063 --> 00:23.023
Hey, guys!

00:23.064 --> 00:24.607
I grew up in Decatur, Alabama,

00:24.649 --> 00:27.777
and it’s just a small town,
with small-town charm.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.738
I’m gonna shoot some
from here, okay?

00:29.779 --> 00:31.406
Nice.

00:33.324 --> 00:35.618
Butt up in the air,
legs crossed.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.745
My God.

00:41.750 --> 00:43.209
Tash told me about her ex,

00:43.251 --> 00:45.462
they have had
difficulties for years.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.297
So, obviously
there’s always a bit of hope

00:47.339 --> 00:49.132
she would run away
from her boyfriend,

00:49.174 --> 00:51.259
and look who would be there.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.640
No.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.517
If you think you’re gonna
come for me like

00:59.559 --> 01:01.895
you come for everyone else,
you’re highly ----ing mistaken.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.065
I’ll switch that bitch off
in two ----ing seconds.

01:05.106 --> 01:07.150
She’s saying you and I need
to manage our time properly,

01:07.192 --> 01:09.235
we’re the most ridiculous
chief stews...

01:09.277 --> 01:11.279
-Wait, wait, wait.
-...your job.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.406
Don’t talk about
a crewmember in front of me.

01:19.371 --> 01:21.706
And I called you a bitch
behind your back, number two.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.125
-Who’d you to, Tash?
-To David.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.127
Yesterday, he goes,
"I called you a bitch,"

01:26.169 --> 01:27.337
and I was like, "Okay."

01:27.379 --> 01:29.089
No, I wanted to be honest,

01:29.130 --> 01:30.423
because that came out
like I hate you.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.841
I’m glad you were honest.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.927
No, I told her, I hate calling
women bitches,

01:33.968 --> 01:35.512
that really irritates me,
when...

01:35.553 --> 01:37.430
He did.

01:37.472 --> 01:38.765
Are you being a bitch?

01:38.807 --> 01:40.433
-You and Captain Sandy?
-Are you being a bitch?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.685
-How am I a bitch?
-You and Captain Sandy?

01:41.726 --> 01:44.604
She stepped in
and she said, "No."

01:44.646 --> 01:45.772
I’ve got nothing to speak about.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.440
I told you what
I told you, facts.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.109
No, you didn’t mention
a few other things.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.111
I’ve got nothing else more to
explain to you than what I did.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.946
If you’re looking for attention,
you’re not gonna get it from me.

01:52.987 --> 01:53.988
-Kyle...
-Look at you now.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.281
"Look at you now."

01:55.323 --> 01:56.741
-Cut this bullsh--.
-Kyle, pipe down.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.368
And Nat, stop.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.460
Looking for attention.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.586
Yeah.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.629
-Cut this bullsh--.
-Kyle, pipe down.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.423
You’ve been ----ing Tash...

02:11.464 --> 02:12.674
I’m literally the most calmest
person sitting here.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.217
-Kyle...
-I’m ----ing calm. Read me.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.802
You’re the one causing
drama already.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.470
No, it’s not--

02:17.512 --> 02:18.471
You been having this fun time.
I ----ing apologized to you,

02:18.513 --> 02:19.931
you got more problems with me.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.891
Face your ----ing sh--.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.268
Yeah, it’s not me,
it’s the team.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.770
-You just did it.
-Guys, stop.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.771
Kyle, come on.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.193
I know that you’re not trying to
be a ----ing knob

02:32.235 --> 02:33.486
or whatever, but...

02:33.528 --> 02:36.614
I’m not gonna apologize
again for this.

02:45.457 --> 02:46.916
But it wasn’t...

02:46.958 --> 02:49.336
it wasn’t that type of vibe,
it was very chill.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.465
I’m not saying...

02:53.506 --> 02:55.675
Yeah, but Nat, you acted
super off to me, and, like,

02:55.717 --> 02:57.802
all I’ve done is try and
be super nice to you.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.471
And I’m sorry that I
didn’t--

03:03.892 --> 03:05.769
No, not you,
I’m speaking about me.

03:09.397 --> 03:11.691
My team, I just feel like

03:11.733 --> 03:14.611
everything’s just exploded
into this big drama.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.072
This is the most traumatic,
dramatic table

03:17.113 --> 03:18.406
I’ve ever sat at in my life.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.701
It is becoming a ----ing
sh---show.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.121
I feel like I need to stop it,
but I don’t know...

03:25.163 --> 03:26.623
I don’t know what to do.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.291
Trust me, it’s not
normally this wild.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.627
I get along with everybody,
but I’m not having someone yell,

03:30.669 --> 03:33.088
"Face the facts, bitch,"
and walk off.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.757
-Bosun’s chair, sit down.
-Bosun’s chair, sit...

03:35.799 --> 03:39.094
-stand... stand up!
-Stand up!

03:39.135 --> 03:40.970
So, what’s the plan?

03:41.012 --> 03:43.932
I’ll sit at the opposite
side of the table.

03:43.973 --> 03:46.351
But I’m not gonna shut up for
people who constantly attack.

03:46.393 --> 03:48.186
No, I appreciate the way

03:48.228 --> 03:49.688
that you stick up for
all of the crew.

03:51.731 --> 03:52.774
No!

03:55.026 --> 03:56.778
I understand I’m in a
restaurant setting,

03:56.820 --> 03:58.613
I understand why I’m,
like, trying to remain calm,

03:58.655 --> 04:00.240
when normally,
if I were called a bitch,

04:00.281 --> 04:01.866
that is not how I’d remain.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.910
If you wanna see angry, wait
till we get back to the yacht

04:03.952 --> 04:07.664
when I actually give that
’tude back to Kyle.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.959
And it’s, like, the one thing
that I learned in conflict

04:11.001 --> 04:14.504
is that if you’re in public,
deal with it later.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.589
-Yeah, but what can I do?
-Private.

04:16.631 --> 04:18.466
-I’m sitting here calm.
-In private.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.301
[Kyle sighs]

04:20.343 --> 04:22.971
You deal with it later.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.183
Not at all, after what
you just said to me.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.435
We are not any longer...

04:28.476 --> 04:29.894
we are colleagues,
we are not friends

04:29.936 --> 04:31.479
after how you
just acted to me.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.648
Kyle.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.151
Okay, that’s tragic, but...

04:36.192 --> 04:37.485
I actually have.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.611
-Kyle, please.
-I don’t care, Kyle.

04:38.653 --> 04:40.196
Just ignore what she’s saying,

04:40.238 --> 04:44.200
block it out, and then say,
okay, you know what, cool.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.662
I have no idea what this is
about, but fortunately enough,

04:47.704 --> 04:50.498
in college, when people
got drunk, they fought.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.126
I would try
to lessen the tension

04:53.168 --> 04:55.628
-Nat, look, I’m not...
-Reid, keep it to yourself.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.799
I think you guys just
need to hold your peace.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.635
Tash, there’s holding peace
and then there’s [bleep].

05:02.677 --> 05:04.137
You know what you need
to say to him.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.680
-You don’t speak...
-I’m not at work right now.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.223
-But...
-It’s happened in work.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.641
I’ve spoken to...

05:08.683 --> 05:10.101
It happened in work and you
were there, you--

05:10.143 --> 05:11.978
-It’s your role to say...
-I wasn’t there.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.605
You can’t call someone a bitch,
that’s your colleague.

05:13.646 --> 05:14.981
I don’t know what happened,
I’m sorry.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.816
Oh, don’t worry,
I’ll tell you.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.985
Tash, you’re chief stew,
you’re the chief stew.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.404
If you want to, like this
not to happen out of work,

05:21.446 --> 05:24.032
you should have handled
this within work hours.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.785
All right, let’s go.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.417
She’s got no balls whatsoever.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.381
Hello, hello!

05:39.422 --> 05:40.715
What up, Gs.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.509
That’s really cute.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.763
Don’t sit at the end.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.224
We don’t need gaps
in the table, Dave.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.142
They don’t want to sit
next to each other.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.563
We’ve got two charters left.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.065
I never have to see
Nat’s face again,

05:57.107 --> 05:58.316
she never has to see mine.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.484
All three of you,
you’re interior.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.735
Like, everyone speak.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.862
I don’t want to
be affected in this.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.864
You’re the chief stew,
so you’re affected in this,

06:04.906 --> 06:06.408
because you haven’t stood
up for me and said

06:06.449 --> 06:07.909
when he called me bitch.
You are the chief stew.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.953
You’ve not addressed
my colleague.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.496
Guys, you’re adults.
I’m not sticking up for anybody.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.997
-Period, she hasn’t.
-She hasn’t

06:13.039 --> 06:14.541
Guys, if you wanna talk,
argue it out between you both.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.709
I don’t need to...

06:15.750 --> 06:17.127
No, Tash, you are
the chief stew.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.753
What do you want me to say?

06:18.795 --> 06:20.964
You called me a bitch within
work hours in front of the...

06:21.006 --> 06:22.215
the captain heard it.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.426
You called me a bitch...

06:27.554 --> 06:28.847
It’s got nothing to do with me.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.224
You called me a bitch, so the...

06:31.266 --> 06:32.308
Look at that.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.309
I will--
look at your attitude!

06:33.351 --> 06:35.270
Look at your attitude.

06:35.311 --> 06:36.688
That is the most tragic thing

06:36.730 --> 06:38.523
I’ve ever seen in
my absolute life.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.026
-Nat ----ing hell.
-Okay, well, I’m off.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.819
Mzi, I found a McDonald’s
for you.

06:42.861 --> 06:45.739
I walked inside,
I ordered six cheeseburgers,

06:45.780 --> 06:48.158
and they said,
"Sorry, we’re closed."

06:49.951 --> 06:50.994
Where is she?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.454
Right now, what needs
to happen is...

06:52.495 --> 06:54.330
-Is I go home?
-You go home... Yeah.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.707
with Storm...

06:55.749 --> 06:57.542
Storm, you’re gonna
go home with Nat.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.585
-No.
-Yes, you are.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.295
I don’t think she wants to.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.963
No, Storm, shut the [bleep] up,
you’re gonna go home with Nat.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.006
Sure.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.257
Define "bitchy"
how you want to...

07:04.299 --> 07:05.925
that’s immature bitchy attitude.

07:05.967 --> 07:10.263
I want to literally go and
put knives in Kyle’s pillow.

07:10.305 --> 07:13.975
I went on my hands and
knees to apologize to her.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.810
She accepted it,
and you still wanna

07:15.852 --> 07:17.103
attack me across the table.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.396
Why don’t we
stop talking about it

07:18.438 --> 07:19.898
and talk about something else?

07:19.939 --> 07:22.359
I’m really sorry how
everything’s turned out.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.736
The thing is, I’m glad
I got... I’m glad

07:24.778 --> 07:27.947
said this from day one,
yes, I was angry at the table

07:27.989 --> 07:31.618
before, obviously, but that’s
angry because to be honest...

07:31.659 --> 07:32.952
What’s that?

07:32.994 --> 07:34.120
I don’t know,
I just put it in my bra.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.248
-I was annoyed.
-You had every right to be.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.917
You forgot to mention,
it’s like,

07:38.958 --> 07:40.293
you know how the situation
happens with, like...

07:40.335 --> 07:41.670
Yes, of course.
I apologize.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.006
Okay, guys, what
the [bleep] is going on?

07:46.883 --> 07:49.469
Well, of course, I have your
back more than anything.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.805
This situation needs
to be resolved.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.598
You know, like,
you’re the chief stew.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.934
At some point you have to have
a bit of professionalism and be,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.812
like, right, Nat’s not okay,
I’m gonna speak to her.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.730
I just wanna deal with
this tomorrow.

08:00.772 --> 08:03.316
Like, I’m not taking any sides.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.317
You three need to have a chat.

08:04.359 --> 08:05.819
Perfect.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.195
Tomorrow morning, you three
need to have a chat.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.822
I know we don’t have
much to talk about,

08:08.863 --> 08:10.740
but I don’t wanna be in
the middle of that.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.454
I’ve been ----ing
frustrated with Nat

08:16.496 --> 08:18.081
and how things have been for us.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.624
I don’t wanna get hurt,
you know?

08:23.003 --> 08:26.673
But to see her like this,
you know, I still...

08:26.715 --> 08:28.091
I care about her.

08:28.133 --> 08:31.553
I just wanna make sure
she’s okay, yeah.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.889
Mm-hmm.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.443
Hey!

08:46.484 --> 08:49.362
Lads and ladies, let’s go.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.739
[panting]

08:52.365 --> 08:53.575
-You’ll be all right, Tash.
-Yeah.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.118
There’s only 10 days left.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.537
I appreciate your support
when I’ve needed it.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.497
Always. I’m always there.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.583
Not just today, always.

09:08.173 --> 09:09.090
[bell tolling]

09:10.967 --> 09:12.635
What time is it,
is it midnight?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.220
Tash.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.680
What?

09:21.102 --> 09:22.896
You’re a very complicated
person, Tash.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.565
I know, I’m sorry
I’m not a vibe.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.234
I just want the truth,
that’s all, nothing else.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.487
I kind of probably should
give up at this point,

09:30.528 --> 09:33.490
but I still think
there is a little bit of hope

09:33.531 --> 09:34.991
with me and Tash.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.785
I can’t help it,
it’s just the way I feel.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.957
Huh?

09:44.459 --> 09:45.585
Let’s go.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.962
Ah... oh!
No, come in, dude!

09:49.381 --> 09:50.757
No, he’s in a bad mood.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.093
What up, D-Money?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.260
Oh, yeah.

10:03.228 --> 10:06.398
It was just a bad
argument tonight.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.816
Period.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.112
Ah, thank you, my friend.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.699
Ooh.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.701
Sh-- day and
a sh-- night.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.869
Going to bed now.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.371
Okay, good night.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.123
Night-night.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.625
How was your night?

10:25.667 --> 10:27.085
Yeah, I don’t know,
it was fine.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.494
Coming up...

11:01.536 --> 11:02.579
Are you sure this is safe?

11:02.620 --> 11:03.830
Yeah, yeah, you’ll be fine.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.373
Honestly, I’ve never
been in a tender

11:05.415 --> 11:06.791
with swells this bad before.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.377
-----ing gnarly.
-Whoa.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.383
Oh! Oh!

11:40.867 --> 11:41.659
I just feel like
I have no need

11:43.119 --> 11:44.954
to even bother
going out next time.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.260
Oh, my God.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.888
Um, [bleep]

12:05.308 --> 12:07.519
I was like, you all
need to ----ing speak.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.442
Yeah.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.573
This wind is making
things difficult.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.576
Ooh.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.495
Jesus, I’m drunk.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.250
The wind is terrible.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.346
[sighs]

12:50.645 --> 12:53.773
I do want Dave to realize
that there are boundaries,

12:53.815 --> 12:57.777
and that there is this line
that he cannot cross.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.071
Like, I don’t wanna
go back into that whole mess

13:00.113 --> 13:02.240
that we were in before.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.585
Oh sh--.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.046
I’ve got enough on
my plate right now.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.339
That’s the last thing I want.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.548
[bleep] it.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.843
I’ve done the swim platform
on main deck.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.720
I’m just gonna go around with
a chamois on the railings,

13:23.762 --> 13:26.389
because they’re all sal-tay.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.601
It’s gonna be, like, over
30 knots of wind in here.

13:31.353 --> 13:34.189
The swells are massive,
what a bummer.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.857
David, Natasha, Storm,
meet me in the crew mess

13:35.899 --> 13:37.359
for a preference sheet meeting.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.943
<i>Copy.</i>

13:44.491 --> 13:45.658
Okay.

13:49.579 --> 13:54.501
Charter number eight, and
we’re all still together.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.336
Hell, yeah.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.879
Strong team.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.423
Garold and Catherine Miller
are no strangers to luxury boats

14:00.465 --> 14:03.176
and have their own
58-foot sailing yacht.

14:03.218 --> 14:04.719
They are looking forward to
celebrating

14:04.761 --> 14:06.054
their 25th wedding anniversary

14:06.096 --> 14:08.264
and having the crew tend
to their every need.

14:08.306 --> 14:10.725
Lila, their youngest daughter,
is a yacht broker,

14:10.767 --> 14:13.019
and she’s looking forward
to celebrating

14:13.061 --> 14:14.729
her 21st birthday on board.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.314
What are you gonna do?

14:16.356 --> 14:19.025
Well, when they arrive
I’m gonna smash out some sushi.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.611
Then for their
25th anniversary celebration,

14:21.653 --> 14:23.488
so, a Spanish theme, yeah,
we can either go tapas

14:23.530 --> 14:25.448
or we can just do
a big paella.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.866
Great idea.

14:26.908 --> 14:29.411
The Millers spend their summers
jet-skiing, snorkeling,

14:29.452 --> 14:33.748
so they want all water toys
out all the time.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.376
Too bad, it doesn’t look like
we’re gonna get off the dock.

14:36.418 --> 14:37.544
Sh--.

14:37.585 --> 14:40.130
We have a major weather
system coming in.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.715
This is not gonna change.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.300
There is no way I’ll be able
to get off the dock,

14:44.342 --> 14:46.678
because it’ll be
so rough out there

14:46.720 --> 14:48.638
there’s no protection
in this weather.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.140
The pressure’s on, huh?

14:50.181 --> 14:52.100
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:52.142 --> 14:54.102
So, port side
hasn’t been washed?

14:54.144 --> 14:55.437
-Yeah, it has.
-It has?

14:55.478 --> 14:57.147
Yeah, I’m just washing
the windows now.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.148
It just needs drying.
Okay.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.650
-Good morning.
-Hi.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.319
Yeah.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.126
Well, okay.

15:18.168 --> 15:24.591
So, this is the meeting I would
have liked to have yesterday,

15:24.632 --> 15:27.594
but it actually
ended up happening out.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.971
Someone gets alcohol
into their system,

15:30.013 --> 15:32.432
it just gets heightened
and raged.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.143
There was no need
to all be shouting.

15:35.185 --> 15:37.812
That was just...

15:37.854 --> 15:39.856
for me, the push-over was
that cabin yesterday.

15:39.898 --> 15:43.068
Then it wasn’t just a situation
where you called me a bitch,

15:43.109 --> 15:46.029
it was a situation where you
actually apparently got really

15:46.071 --> 15:47.614
hotheaded to the point
that Captain Sandy

15:47.655 --> 15:49.824
actually stepped in,
which I’ve heard,

15:49.866 --> 15:51.409
and said that’s not appropriate.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.829
I agree that situation did
happen, but I came down to you,

15:54.871 --> 15:56.247
and I feel like I was wrong,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.833
and that’s 100 percent
what I took on me.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.168
I appreciate that apology,

16:00.210 --> 16:01.169
but then you went ahead
and called me

16:01.211 --> 16:02.295
a bitch again last night.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.172
So, you’ve just done it again,

16:04.214 --> 16:05.799
so that apology
means nothing to me.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.552
Last night, in an out-of-work
zone, you called me a bitch now

16:09.594 --> 16:11.346
within my-- which isn’t a funny.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.556
You’ve then called me a bitch
at the table...

16:13.598 --> 16:15.600
And I called you that, and
I also said that to your face.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.810
Exactly, you said it
at the dinner table

16:16.851 --> 16:18.186
in front of the crew.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.521
It was not appropriate,
and you last night...

16:19.562 --> 16:20.855
And you attacking me
in front of the crew

16:20.897 --> 16:22.232
or in that time
is appropriate?

16:22.273 --> 16:23.233
-You’re the--
-You’re talking about

16:23.274 --> 16:24.693
Tash being professional,

16:24.734 --> 16:26.486
you’re talking about me
being professional...

16:26.528 --> 16:28.029
get your sh-- together and
you start acting professional.

16:28.071 --> 16:29.572
I said... see, look how
aggressive you’re getting.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.199
Look how aggressive
your approach is, sis.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.617
When that voice comes out,
that is exactly--

16:32.659 --> 16:33.618
Look at your voice.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.203
-Kyle?
-Yeah.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.413
The difference here is that
I say stuff to people’s face,

16:36.454 --> 16:37.706
not behind their back.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.332
And if you wanna go
down that trail...

16:39.374 --> 16:40.709
-And I said everything...
-I will take that.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.960
I disagree with this,
because I have heard

16:42.002 --> 16:43.920
that I was called a bad manager,

16:43.962 --> 16:46.798
I can’t manage my time,
I’m unapproachable...

16:46.840 --> 16:48.633
I’ve never said you were
unapproachable.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.011
And these are all the things
that were said behind my back.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.556
Things get said about people
in heat of the moment,

16:54.597 --> 16:56.266
and I understand that,
because clearly,

16:56.307 --> 16:57.934
everyone said something.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.937
I think maybe going forward, if
you feel like there’s something

17:00.979 --> 17:04.232
that’s upsetting you
or needs to change,

17:04.274 --> 17:06.484
then I think we just
speak about it first.

17:06.526 --> 17:10.447
Stop arguments later down
the line of us getting stressed,

17:10.488 --> 17:13.158
and I think we just try
to make things better.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.451
Okay, I agree with that.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.001
Nat, I’m not blowing
smoke in your ass,

17:23.043 --> 17:25.045
I’m saying facts is facts.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.755
Work-wise, you’re outstanding.

17:26.796 --> 17:32.677
I am genuinely apologetic
for the use of the words.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.888
I have no excuse but complete
exhaustion,

17:34.929 --> 17:39.225
and sorry, I just...

17:48.360 --> 17:51.529
Can we just stop bitching now,
because we--

17:57.077 --> 17:58.161
I naturally defend myself.

17:58.203 --> 18:00.121
I grew up having to be that.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.707
I was bullied immensely in
high school

18:02.749 --> 18:04.459
and primary school,
thrown in bins.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.795
That was a very
tough time for me.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.214
With Nat, I haven’t
been thinking

18:09.255 --> 18:10.548
where she’s coming from.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.883
It doesn’t feel right.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.468
Okay, new rule...

18:13.510 --> 18:15.553
no one talk sh-- about
each other because I’m happy...

18:15.595 --> 18:19.015
I wouldn’t say... like I love us
talking sh-- about other people.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.308
-Yeah.
-Maybe not interior.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.643
Let’s not change
too many things now.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.270
-We’re all good in here!
-We’re fine.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.689
Coming up...

18:32.070 --> 18:34.030
There’s no chance.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.281
I thought there was.

18:35.323 --> 18:36.282
I just wanna run away.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.334
The weather looks ----ing sh--.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.213
Oh, wow, it’s coming off
beautifully.

18:50.255 --> 18:51.631
Towels, towels.

18:54.175 --> 18:58.513
Towels, towels, more towels.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.559
Yeah, I think I need a coffee

19:02.600 --> 19:04.436
and I’m gonna grab
a doughnut, too.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.062
Did you...
are you having a coffee, Kyle?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.939
Yeah, I’m making coffees.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.318
That’s all right,
I can just--

19:12.360 --> 19:13.987
Sorry?

19:16.406 --> 19:17.949
I’ll make it.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.579
What?

19:24.581 --> 19:26.499
All crew, all crew,
we have provisions.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.336
All crew, we have provisions
on the dock.

19:29.377 --> 19:30.587
Copy.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.630
When did the golf balls arrive?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.631
[laughing]

19:36.509 --> 19:39.929
Very light, this is going
to be party decorations

19:39.971 --> 19:41.473
for the next two days.

19:45.977 --> 19:49.314
All crew, all crew, meet
in the main salon in your whites

19:49.356 --> 19:52.359
at 11:55 for a 12:00 arrival.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.611
Copy for interior.

20:00.158 --> 20:02.327
Oh, my God, it’s just...

20:02.369 --> 20:04.621
I don’t know what
this knot’s from.

20:04.662 --> 20:06.498
Ow!

20:11.336 --> 20:12.379
I’m hungry.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.546
Crew mess looks good.

20:15.924 --> 20:18.009
The guests are actually
walking up to us right now.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.637
-We are coming home.
-It’s a sick boat.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.055
All crew to the dock, please,

20:22.097 --> 20:24.349
all crew to the dock
for guest arrival.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.017
-Oh, it’s...
-It’s beautiful.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.102
Yeah, I love it.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.311
Oh, I’m so excited.

20:28.353 --> 20:29.521
Oh, and there’s our crew.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.522
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!

20:30.563 --> 20:31.856
-Hey!
-Hello!

20:31.898 --> 20:33.316
Oh, my God, it’s so elegant.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.568
-Hi, I’m Garold.
-Nice to meet you.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.611
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Hi, I’m Natasha.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.321
Lila, nice to meet you.

20:38.363 --> 20:41.324
Oh, I wore my boating shoes, so
I can just slip ’em right off.

20:41.366 --> 20:43.827
Dad’s got the Guccis on.

20:43.868 --> 20:46.204
-Welcome aboard...
-Thank you.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.205
your Home away from home.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.415
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:48.456 --> 20:49.416
Our chief stew is gonna
show you around.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.084
Great.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.335
And then I’m gonna come chat
to you about the weather.

20:52.377 --> 20:53.336
-Okay.
-All right.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.754
Okay.

20:54.796 --> 20:55.964
The good weather, right,
it’s beautiful.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.257
Oh, God.

20:57.298 --> 20:58.550
-Yeah, at least it’s sunny.
-It’s so sunny.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.801
I don’t know if it’s the...

20:59.843 --> 21:01.052
we’re not leaving
the dock today,

21:01.094 --> 21:02.595
but I’ll tell you about
it in there.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.639
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.349
Perfect tanning weather.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.227
They see sunny skies, and
right now the wind’s not bad.

21:09.269 --> 21:13.148
However, on the outside
of this port it’s really bad,

21:13.189 --> 21:15.692
and wind brings waves, period.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.193
There are big waves.

21:17.235 --> 21:18.987
I’m literally gonna cry.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.658
-That’s a bummer.
-What’s that?

21:23.700 --> 21:25.160
That we’re not
leaving the dock.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.037
Yeah, I mean, it is a bummer,
can you believe it?

21:27.078 --> 21:28.621
All right, thank you.

21:28.663 --> 21:30.832
-Here we go, cheers.
-Thank you.

21:30.874 --> 21:32.125
Cheers, Li.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.419
Kinda look like a
’90s porn star right now.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.004
-Me?
-Yeah, you do, very much.

21:36.046 --> 21:38.298
-Moustache and glasses.
-It’s the yellow lenses, yeah.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.382
Yeah.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.425
You’re taking us on the tour?

21:40.467 --> 21:41.426
Yes, I am, is everyone ready?

21:41.468 --> 21:42.761
-Yes.
-Of course.

21:45.096 --> 21:46.306
Ooh, this is so pretty.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.599
Wow.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.808
Oh, so, yeah,
here’s our lunch table.

21:48.850 --> 21:49.768
Gorgeous.

21:51.436 --> 21:53.563
It’s ridiculous, isn’t it?

21:53.605 --> 21:55.148
So, this seems like
the party place, up here.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.566
-This is the party pad.
-This is the party pad.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.401
This is where we
gotta have my birthday.

21:58.443 --> 22:00.612
Yeah, we kinda heat this up
because it’s a bit cold.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.364
I’ll make it hotter
when I get in.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.865
Oh, wow.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.164
Yeah.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.085
Is this all of it?

22:15.126 --> 22:16.378
Yeah.

22:16.419 --> 22:17.587
Lunch will be served
in 10 minutes,

22:17.629 --> 22:18.922
so you’ve gotta hurry up.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.548
All right, we’ll hurry up.

22:20.590 --> 22:21.633
We’ll speed up.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.218
Don’t be shellfish.

22:23.259 --> 22:24.844
Is there a certain time you
might like to have lunch?

22:24.886 --> 22:27.222
Do we wanna finish with
the tour, freshen up,

22:27.263 --> 22:29.474
maybe get settled a little,
and then have lunch?

22:29.516 --> 22:30.725
Yeah.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.394
-So, should we say, like, 1:30?
-1:00?

22:32.435 --> 22:33.520
Let’s say 1:00.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.854
What’s the beam throughout here?

22:34.896 --> 22:37.273
Like, this feels kinda,
like, short, almost.

22:37.315 --> 22:39.609
Do you... you mean, like,
it’s quite small?

22:39.651 --> 22:40.860
The width.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.779
Yeah, like, the beam
of this room.

22:42.821 --> 22:43.822
Oh, I can find out for
you if you like.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.031
-Yeah?
-Yeah, sure.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.324
I’m curious.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.784
I’ve had a charter broker
as a guest before,

22:47.826 --> 22:50.620
and it was actually a nightmare.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.955
He tested us.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.957
He went around the boat
and he did things

22:53.998 --> 22:55.667
to check that we’d checked.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.086
He stuck, like, a piece
of chewing gum behind an apple

22:58.128 --> 23:01.798
in a fruit bowl to check that we
were checking the fruit bowls.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.135
What year is this boat,
do you remember, 2018?

23:05.176 --> 23:06.928
It’s 2016, ’17.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.472
<i>Dave, Dave, Tasha.</i>

23:09.514 --> 23:12.183
<i>They would like lunch at 1:00.</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:18.064
Hi.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.149
Hi, I wanted to say hi.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.109
-Since you’re a boater...
-Yeah.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.736
I was gonna come
talk to you guys.

23:22.777 --> 23:24.696
-So, this is what we’re...
-Working with?

23:24.738 --> 23:25.947
Yeah, it’s terrible.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.073
Oh, gosh.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.325
Yeah, so this is the wave,
so see this?

23:29.367 --> 23:31.453
-Oh, my God.
-This is meters.

23:31.494 --> 23:32.579
-Yeah.
-So, it’s crazy.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.164
It’s bad.

23:34.205 --> 23:38.043
Right now, we’d be...
it would be dangerous to leave.

23:38.084 --> 23:38.877
Yeah.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.462
What do you think tomorrow?

23:40.503 --> 23:41.671
Well, we can’t leave the dock.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.548
Tomorrow, we look
at the weather.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.924
Yeah, we’ll just cross
our fingers.

23:44.966 --> 23:47.260
The minute it lays down,
I’ll take off.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.845
Yeah. Okay.

23:54.392 --> 23:55.894
Dave?

23:57.062 --> 23:58.646
1:00 for lunch?

24:02.400 --> 24:04.235
-Davey?
-Yeah.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.236
Thirty minutes to lunch.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.738
Thirty minutes?

24:06.780 --> 24:09.032
-They want it at 1:00?
-Yeah, 30 minutes to lunch.

24:09.074 --> 24:10.867
They want it at...

24:53.243 --> 24:53.827
Where’s my parents?

24:54.869 --> 24:56.496
Oh, here they are.

24:56.538 --> 24:58.331
I need a drink.

25:01.418 --> 25:02.961
What’s that?

25:06.381 --> 25:08.091
How am I being rude?

25:08.133 --> 25:09.467
I just, I... I... it’s not
my fault we’re out of mint.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.302
You’ve been rude to me
all morning, Dave.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.471
Sorry, how have
I been rude to you?

25:13.513 --> 25:14.639
I haven’t said anything.

25:14.681 --> 25:15.974
I’m just getting
on with my job.

25:16.016 --> 25:17.392
Exactly, that’s the thing.

25:17.434 --> 25:18.977
Well, then...

25:19.019 --> 25:20.270
You won’t communicate
with me.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.776
All right.

25:26.818 --> 25:28.069
The wind here,
but this is the waves.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.404
Yeah.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.281
It’s deceiving, because
you can’t see the swell.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.824
Do you want me to find a bay
that we can go

25:32.866 --> 25:34.159
and put you in the water
with some of the toys?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.994
Duck out with the tender,
check it out.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.580
All right, Courts and I are
gonna go and have a look, okay?

25:38.621 --> 25:39.914
Yeah.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.458
I wanna go, like,
swimming or something.

25:41.499 --> 25:42.834
I wanna go do something, yeah.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.294
Look at how cute Mom looks.

25:44.336 --> 25:47.547
See if she’ll marry me
another 25 years.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.424
We’re gonna go to the other
side of the marina

25:49.466 --> 25:52.135
to go see if it’s accessible for
us to actually get in the water.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.389
Yeah.

26:00.393 --> 26:03.772
Will you tie my top a
little tighter, actually?

26:04.773 --> 26:05.732
Mom.

26:05.774 --> 26:07.025
Thanks, mate.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.151
Okay. You can go, Courts.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.865
See, look at the horizon,
it’s ----ing gnarly.

26:13.907 --> 26:15.700
Yeah, man.
[bleep] me.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.868
You sure this is safe?

26:16.910 --> 26:18.620
Yeah, yeah, you’ll be fine.

26:18.661 --> 26:21.164
Okay, punch it,
straight up the middle.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.084
[bleep] me, like, honestly,

26:24.125 --> 26:27.212
I’ve never been in a tender
with swells this bad before.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.214
Whoa.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.675
All I can see is these
massive ----ing waves,

26:31.716 --> 26:33.760
like, holy [bleep].

26:35.345 --> 26:36.346
No.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.140
Yeah.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.935
-I’m hungry.
-This is so awesome.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.688
Okay, they’re having
a seat now.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.189
We’re gonna start
with the bread.

26:46.231 --> 26:47.190
Okay, great.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.108
Thank you.

26:48.149 --> 26:51.444
-You’re welcome.
-Good job.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.323
My stomach’s going
[rumbles].

26:55.365 --> 26:58.243
I took Courtney to where we
usually do our water sports...

26:58.284 --> 26:59.494
huge swells.

26:59.536 --> 27:00.495
Not safe for the guests at all.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.122
Okay, so you went through...

27:02.163 --> 27:03.415
We went through the bridge,
we went to the opposite side,

27:03.456 --> 27:04.791
and it’s not safe.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.584
Honestly, the whole boat
was like this at one point,

27:06.626 --> 27:07.585
and like this.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.754
-Hectic.
-Yeah.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.256
So, definitely
not going out now.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.091
Shall I take them to, like,
a museum or something?

27:13.133 --> 27:15.010
Just phone Rico and ask him
can they organize

27:15.051 --> 27:16.594
a tour guide and some cars?

27:16.636 --> 27:18.013
Yeah, okay, good.

27:18.054 --> 27:19.806
I’m glad you checked it
out without the guests.

27:19.848 --> 27:20.807
-All right, cool, thanks.
-Yeah, me too.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.434
That’s always good.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.519
It’s just bad timing, and
especially for this charter,

27:24.561 --> 27:25.687
they’re super active.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.355
All they wanna do
is water sports.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.191
We need to think of something
or we’re totally screwed.

27:30.233 --> 27:33.778
Sake, sake, sake,
boom, boom, boom.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.904
And then you chug it.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.573
Oh, yeah, get it!

27:36.614 --> 27:37.741
So proud, oh!

27:37.782 --> 27:39.117
So proud of my girls.

27:39.159 --> 27:40.577
Hey, dude, the ocean’s
too dangerous

27:40.618 --> 27:41.578
for me to take them on.

27:41.619 --> 27:42.787
It’s terrible out there.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.581
Is there any way that
we can take them

27:44.622 --> 27:45.874
on a guided tour today?

27:45.915 --> 27:47.625
I know it’s pretty late notice.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.420
We recently went to some sort of
fort and restaurants and stuff.

27:50.462 --> 27:52.464
Is that something we
could potentially do?

27:52.505 --> 27:53.840
Let me know, thanks.

27:53.882 --> 27:55.967
Ooh, what are these?

27:56.009 --> 27:57.969
Prawn, avocado,
and spicy salmon.

27:58.011 --> 28:00.722
Oh, my God,
this looks beautiful.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.890
Thank you, what about the food?

28:01.931 --> 28:03.767
[laughing]

28:03.808 --> 28:05.060
Ah, this is the life.

28:07.854 --> 28:09.647
I’m trying to think
about what’s next.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.066
Yeah, right?

28:11.107 --> 28:13.860
At 3:30, we need them
on the swim platform.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.487
We’re taking them
to the cannons,

28:15.528 --> 28:16.738
and at least we can get them off
the boat for, like, two hours.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.114
Thank God.

28:18.156 --> 28:19.741
Wow, you polished off
those wontons, huh?

28:19.783 --> 28:23.036
She might have been worried
that you were gonna take them.

28:23.078 --> 28:24.204
I think she was.

28:28.041 --> 28:29.626
-Nat?
-Hi, girl.

28:29.668 --> 28:31.711
<i>Kyle, you can do the cabins,</i>
<i>turning them over.</i>

28:31.753 --> 28:32.921
<i>You can go on a break.</i>

28:32.962 --> 28:33.922
Copy.

28:33.963 --> 28:35.423
I’m, like, stuffed.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.966
I wanna walk around
the boat a little.

28:37.008 --> 28:38.551
Let’s go.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.554
I’m gonna trip on this thing.

28:41.596 --> 28:43.473
Kyle, Nat’s gonna head
on her break now.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.600
Well, where is everyone?

28:45.642 --> 28:47.268
I wanna ----ing be underway

28:47.310 --> 28:51.898
and sit in those
----ing superhero chairs.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.571
Hey, guys, we’ve organized for
a private tour to this...

28:58.613 --> 29:02.200
every afternoon at 12:00 and
at 4:00 they set off cannons.

29:02.242 --> 29:03.702
Okay.

29:03.743 --> 29:05.412
So, basically, in half an hour,
if you could make your way

29:05.453 --> 29:07.038
to the stern, to the back
of the boat,

29:07.080 --> 29:08.164
we’re gonna put you in
a bunch of cars,

29:08.206 --> 29:10.208
and then set the cannons
of for you guys.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.668
-Oh, up there?
-Yeah.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.253
-All right?
-Yeah.

29:16.131 --> 29:18.383
Hey Courts, will you get
changed into your polo?

29:18.425 --> 29:19.592
Yeah.

29:19.634 --> 29:20.969
You, Mzi, and Reid are
gonna go with them.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.303
Okay, cool.

29:22.345 --> 29:24.055
You guys are leaving in 15
minutes, okay?

29:24.097 --> 29:25.557
Okay, sweet,
I’ll go get changed.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.894
Ready, Lila Rose?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.062
Yes.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.772
Back into my schoolboy outfit.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.232
Yeah, hello, hello.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.067
-Hey, little buddy!
-Hey, little buddy!

29:36.109 --> 29:37.569
All right, I have
my phone, right?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.945
That’s the most important thing,
to take pictures.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.321
I don’t, but I don’t need it.

29:40.363 --> 29:42.615
You may call me
a 12-year-old boy, but...

29:44.951 --> 29:46.578
-Hi.
-Hi.

29:46.619 --> 29:49.956
All right, enjoy, guys.
Have a good time, yeah?

29:49.998 --> 29:53.293
-Yeah, kids in one?
-Yeah.

29:53.335 --> 29:54.753
Let’s go shoot some cannons!

29:54.794 --> 29:56.338
Hey.

29:56.379 --> 29:57.756
Why didn’t you come in earlier,
I’ve been waiting.

29:57.797 --> 29:59.591
Because I thought you
were having a snooze.

29:59.632 --> 30:00.925
Yeah, but I was waiting for you.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.218
What exactly is
going on right now?

30:02.260 --> 30:03.762
We’re going to a tower.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.431
We’re going to a tower,
because they let of cannons.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.309
Basically, these big cannons
go off every day.

30:11.644 --> 30:15.315
Have a cuddle, couple of kisses,
and you fell asleep with me.

30:15.357 --> 30:17.609
You guys, you think we’re gonna
get off the dock tomorrow?

30:17.650 --> 30:20.362
I think we should
get off tomorrow.

30:20.403 --> 30:21.529
Awesome.

30:21.571 --> 30:22.906
I hope we’re able
to get off the dock.

30:22.947 --> 30:25.450
This is our last
few days together.

30:25.492 --> 30:27.619
Yeah.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.454
Storm’s really in
the good books at the moment.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.748
You know, I’ve been a little
stressed lately with, like,

30:31.790 --> 30:33.625
what’s going on with,
like, the interior,

30:33.667 --> 30:36.419
so it’s nice to have him,
like, around to, like, cuddle.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.338
It makes me happy to see him.

30:38.380 --> 30:39.547
Don’t tell him I said that.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.010
Whoa.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.933
Oh, my God!

30:49.974 --> 30:51.309
Hey, guys, we’re
gonna go this way.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.478
We’re off to see some cannons.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.650
Okay, are we good,
have we got everyone?

30:58.692 --> 31:00.944
All right, we have seven
minutes still, we’re okay.

31:00.985 --> 31:04.322
Go, go, and we’ll get you some
drinks, ready for the cannons.

31:06.324 --> 31:07.784
Oh, what can I get you to drink?

31:07.826 --> 31:08.952
What do you have?

31:08.993 --> 31:10.995
Prosecco, wine,
beers, champagne.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.039
-Rosé.
-Rosé?

31:16.251 --> 31:17.669
This is amazing.

31:17.711 --> 31:18.753
That’s beautiful.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.173
In that corner, you know,
see where the red boat...

31:22.215 --> 31:23.591
-Yeah.
-The big red ships are?

31:23.633 --> 31:25.844
To the right of them
in that little bay there,

31:25.885 --> 31:27.721
that’s where we wanna take you
to do water sports tomorrow.

31:27.762 --> 31:29.472
Okay.

31:29.514 --> 31:30.640
If we can’t leave the dock,
then we’ll head over there.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.517
And it looks protected,
at least.

31:32.559 --> 31:34.686
If the weather’s okay, are we
gonna go out into the open?

31:34.728 --> 31:36.312
Yeah, so, Captain Sandy wants
to obviously

31:36.354 --> 31:37.689
take the boat out
as soon as we can.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.442
So, if the swell gets
a bit better, we will.

31:40.483 --> 31:43.028
It’s really hard to keep guests
entertained for, like,

31:43.069 --> 31:44.696
a full ----ing day,
like, 12 hours.

31:44.738 --> 31:46.781
They’re all sailors,
they’re all in yachting.

31:46.823 --> 31:50.326
Like, yeah, it’s not
a great situation.

31:50.368 --> 31:52.370
I think the cannon’s
about to go.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.581
Evening gun, fire!

31:54.622 --> 31:56.750
-[bleep]
-Oh!

31:56.791 --> 31:58.335
-[bleep]
-[cheering]

31:59.878 --> 32:01.421
Coming up...

32:01.463 --> 32:03.006
Do you guys not think
dinner’s taking a long time?

32:03.048 --> 32:04.257
You can speak up, but...

32:04.299 --> 32:05.800
-Well...
-Just pace yourself, it’s fine.

32:05.842 --> 32:07.260
But, like, really.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.720
Are these ready to go?

32:08.762 --> 32:10.889
There are too many
people hanging around.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.557
Yeah.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.152
What’s going on out here?

32:25.653 --> 32:27.322
We’re going Spanish theme.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.407
They want the theme
to match the food.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.950
Is today the anniversary?

32:30.992 --> 32:32.786
Yeah, can you believe
they’ve been together 25 years?

32:32.827 --> 32:35.580
They don’t look old
enough for that.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.916
Oh, my God, are you playing
with your balls again, honey?

32:37.957 --> 32:40.335
-Yeah.
-Hope you enjoyed that.

32:40.377 --> 32:41.628
-We loved it!
-Yes, that was very cool.

32:41.670 --> 32:44.631
So, if you want to ask
any questions,

32:44.673 --> 32:46.800
we just move near
the guns there,

32:46.841 --> 32:48.802
and I will give you
any answers you like.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.428
Okay.

32:50.470 --> 32:52.639
So, do we think that tomorrow
we’re gonna get off the dock?

32:52.681 --> 32:54.224
Right here.

32:54.265 --> 32:55.809
Thanks, hon.

32:55.850 --> 32:58.103
Have we go that Mad Hatter’s
cake stand somewhere?

32:58.144 --> 32:59.104
Yeah, it’s in the bilge.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.814
I’ll pull it out now.

33:00.855 --> 33:03.066
Apparently we’re gonna use it
for dinner tonight on the table.

33:03.108 --> 33:04.317
Oh, okay.

33:04.359 --> 33:06.403
Talk to me,
what’s the dinner plan?

33:06.444 --> 33:08.697
It’s paella.

33:08.738 --> 33:09.698
No.

33:09.739 --> 33:10.824
Sh--.

33:10.865 --> 33:12.117
So, I need massive spot
on the table?

33:12.158 --> 33:13.326
Set it up inside, then.

33:13.368 --> 33:14.703
-Okay.
-How many starters?

33:14.744 --> 33:17.872
I’m kind of just doing
as many as I can.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.667
-Are you okay?
-Not really.

33:20.709 --> 33:24.212
I’m just having a hard time
processing it.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.214
There’s no chance.

33:26.256 --> 33:27.590
I thought there was.

33:27.632 --> 33:29.426
But it’s so dumb,
it’s stupid.

33:29.467 --> 33:32.929
Like, I just wanna run away.

33:39.310 --> 33:42.063
Come on, David.
----ing hell.

33:42.105 --> 33:43.565
Guys, that was awesome.

33:49.362 --> 33:51.197
Thanks, Dad!

33:51.239 --> 33:52.490
[car honks]

33:52.532 --> 33:54.743
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
beep, beep.

33:58.997 --> 34:00.832
Dave seems like a bit
in a mood, doesn’t he?

34:00.874 --> 34:03.209
Oh, he’s not even
talking to me at all?

34:03.251 --> 34:04.919
Why, what has happened?

34:04.961 --> 34:06.379
Not even a word.

34:06.421 --> 34:08.256
He’s been messaging me,
so I told him to stop.

34:08.298 --> 34:10.258
Oh, you [bleep].

34:10.300 --> 34:11.885
-Right.
-Silly things, it’s just...

34:11.926 --> 34:12.886
Yeah.

34:12.927 --> 34:13.970
Well, hang in there.

34:14.012 --> 34:15.930
You’re doing so good
to maintain.

34:17.891 --> 34:18.933
The guests are here.

34:18.975 --> 34:20.393
Are you able to come down
and greet

34:20.435 --> 34:22.145
with these sangrias
that I’ve made?

34:22.187 --> 34:23.772
-Yeah.
-Welcome back.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.148
Thank you.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.149
Hi, guys, welcome back.

34:26.191 --> 34:27.400
-How are you?
-Hi.

34:27.442 --> 34:28.401
How was that?
Can I take it from you?

34:28.443 --> 34:29.402
Yes, please, thank you.

34:29.444 --> 34:30.570
More drinks?

34:30.612 --> 34:31.946
Sangria.

34:31.988 --> 34:33.239
You’ll probably have time
to, like, freshen up,

34:33.281 --> 34:34.491
and if you wanna change.

34:34.532 --> 34:35.909
I’m thinking, like,
dinner at 8:00?

34:35.950 --> 34:37.202
-I mean, I don’t know.
-Dinner at 8:30...

34:37.243 --> 34:38.620
Well, yeah, 8:00, 8:30?

34:38.661 --> 34:39.746
Perfect.

34:39.788 --> 34:40.997
Ah.

34:54.344 --> 34:57.305
We look good, baby.

34:57.347 --> 34:58.640
I feel like
I’m, like, a housewife.

34:58.682 --> 35:00.308
I’m about to bake
you a cherry pie.

35:00.350 --> 35:02.769
I want you to
pop my cherry pie.

35:02.811 --> 35:03.978
Look at you.

35:04.020 --> 35:07.107
Hey, you’re looking
a little crazy!

35:07.148 --> 35:09.275
So, tensions are high.

35:09.317 --> 35:10.443
What?

35:10.485 --> 35:11.736
Like, I went down to the galley,

35:11.778 --> 35:13.530
and he’s being
so short with her.

35:13.571 --> 35:15.615
----ing hell.

35:15.657 --> 35:17.409
<i>Deck crew, deck crew,</i>

35:17.450 --> 35:19.828
<i>we’re gonna have to all help</i>
<i>interior however we can.</i>

35:21.204 --> 35:22.706
Say!

35:25.041 --> 35:26.626
Do you want any help,
you want me to wash up?

35:26.668 --> 35:29.045
-No, I’m good, mate.
-Okay, no worries.

35:29.087 --> 35:30.046
No, yeah, all good.

35:30.088 --> 35:31.172
Hi.

35:31.214 --> 35:33.008
Wow, this is awesome.

35:33.049 --> 35:34.134
Who did that?

35:34.175 --> 35:35.802
-Tash.
-It was a magician.

35:35.844 --> 35:37.804
-No, Tash did the roses.
-Beautiful.

35:37.846 --> 35:39.222
Considering we’re on the dock,

35:39.264 --> 35:41.307
the crew are pulling
out every stop.

35:41.349 --> 35:43.518
The table setting, the themes,

35:43.560 --> 35:46.813
the courses that David
has to make to keep up.

35:46.855 --> 35:48.940
That’s a lot of pressure
on the chef.

35:48.982 --> 35:52.444
They’re all, like, committed
to this, which I’m really happy,

35:52.485 --> 35:54.154
to try to keep
the guests happy.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.613
How clever is that?

35:55.655 --> 35:57.032
Okay, Dave, what do
you need for cutlery?

35:57.073 --> 35:58.783
Just need, like, ramekins
and stuff, do you know?

35:58.825 --> 36:01.619
Little dishes just
to put this stuff in.

36:01.661 --> 36:03.038
Oh, my God, that’s so cool.

36:03.079 --> 36:04.873
Mom, look what they
did for you guys.

36:04.914 --> 36:07.042
Oh my God,
I love that, it’s so pretty.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.501
Yeah, well, let’s eat.

36:08.543 --> 36:09.669
-Did you see them on...
-I’m starving, Mom.

36:09.711 --> 36:11.463
I’m so sorry you’re so hungry.

36:11.504 --> 36:12.630
-I think we’re--
-Are you so hungry?

36:12.672 --> 36:13.631
We have to wait a moment,
though.

36:13.673 --> 36:15.008
When are we eating, at 8:30?

36:15.050 --> 36:16.092
Hey, happy anniversary.

36:16.134 --> 36:17.844
Thanks, honey.
I love you.

36:17.886 --> 36:19.679
I love you, too.

36:19.721 --> 36:21.598
Don’t fill up to
the top, top, top.

36:21.639 --> 36:23.600
So, we’ve got rye
and cacao bread.

36:23.641 --> 36:26.686
Okay, rye and cacao.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.855
What can I use for this,
can I use this?

36:28.897 --> 36:30.190
I don’t know, man,
you have to...

36:30.231 --> 36:31.691
-that’s not my...
-Okay.

36:31.733 --> 36:33.068
[bleep] it, I don’t know.

36:34.944 --> 36:38.573
Sh--, he’s in a mood,
and not good at all.

36:38.615 --> 36:40.408
Thank you, fantastic, yeah.

36:42.744 --> 36:45.205
Ladies and gentlemen,
I’m sorry to disturb you.

36:45.246 --> 36:47.082
Obviously, there’s no rush,
but to let you know,

36:47.123 --> 36:48.708
we’re ready for service when
you are at the top, yeah.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.043
-Oh, great.
-Awesome.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.628
Let’s go.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.466
Yeah, come hang.

36:56.508 --> 36:59.427
-This is beautiful.
-This looks so great.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.887
The wines will roll out shortly,

37:00.929 --> 37:02.681
but we’ll start with
the waters, all right?

37:02.722 --> 37:04.224
Let’s get this going.

37:04.265 --> 37:05.392
Awesome.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.727
Would you like sparkling
or still water?

37:07.769 --> 37:09.187
Sparkling, please.

37:09.229 --> 37:11.648
Okay, Davey, guests are
at the table,

37:11.690 --> 37:13.066
they’ve started with the breads,

37:13.108 --> 37:14.609
we’re filling in waters now,
all right?

37:14.651 --> 37:15.777
Okay, mate.

37:15.819 --> 37:16.903
Oh, my God, what are you making?

37:16.945 --> 37:18.446
It’s called a leg-spreader.

37:18.488 --> 37:19.906
-Oh, my God.
-I’m just making it up.

37:19.948 --> 37:22.867
Tash is busy with cocktails,
so I will be here.

37:22.909 --> 37:24.077
Okay.

37:24.119 --> 37:26.079
Do you mind if I start with
these while--

37:26.121 --> 37:28.248
You can go, yeah,
you can do as you want, man.

37:28.289 --> 37:31.459
He said that was rye bread
with cacao, the dark one.

37:31.501 --> 37:33.253
With what?

37:33.294 --> 37:34.796
-Cacao, chocolate.
-Rye with cacao chocolate.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.256
Oh. Sorry, I thought
you said "with cow."

37:36.297 --> 37:37.465
-Yeah, with cow.
-No, cacao.

37:37.507 --> 37:38.508
Well, for you it’s cow.

37:38.550 --> 37:39.676
Are these ready to go?

37:42.012 --> 37:43.680
----ing [bleep].

37:43.722 --> 37:46.266
We have the
Spanish tortilla.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.767
Here, we have cod.

37:47.809 --> 37:49.060
Shall I get a tray for this?

37:49.102 --> 37:50.228
Yeah, all right, mate.

37:50.270 --> 37:51.438
Can you take one of
these trays, please?

37:51.479 --> 37:53.857
-Yes.
-And...

37:53.898 --> 37:55.025
Hello.

37:55.066 --> 37:56.818
-Ooh!
-Hola!

37:56.860 --> 37:58.945
There are too many people
hanging around.

37:58.987 --> 38:00.071
Yeah.

38:00.113 --> 38:01.656
Too many people
asking questions.

38:03.950 --> 38:05.785
Random plastic bag,
may look like rubbish...

38:05.827 --> 38:07.287
they use this for stuff.

38:07.328 --> 38:09.831
So, pop that in here.

38:09.873 --> 38:12.500
These underwear...
dirty, don’t touch them.

38:12.542 --> 38:14.669
[laughing]

38:19.215 --> 38:20.800
-Which would you like?
-What is it again?

38:20.842 --> 38:22.135
-This is cod.
-Yeah?

38:22.177 --> 38:24.346
In flour batter,

38:24.387 --> 38:25.930
and then we have
mentega over there.

38:25.972 --> 38:27.390
Yeah, I’ll pass.
Thank you.

38:27.432 --> 38:28.975
No worries.
You’re welcome.

38:29.017 --> 38:30.810
I don’t know what
I’ve been told...

38:30.852 --> 38:33.480
where do these plates go?

38:33.521 --> 38:35.148
If this has been used,
throw it away?

38:35.190 --> 38:37.817
It’s not been used,
it’s a shower cap.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.110
-It’s a shower?
-Cap.

38:39.152 --> 38:41.321
Oh, for the head.

38:41.363 --> 38:42.322
So, what’s coming next?

38:42.364 --> 38:44.157
Chicken and prawn paella.

38:44.199 --> 38:45.784
There you go.

38:48.036 --> 38:51.039
Dave, just to let you know,
we’re clearing now.

38:51.081 --> 38:52.832
-You’re clearing now, okay.
-Ready for the paella.

38:52.874 --> 38:54.668
Okay.

38:59.172 --> 39:00.882
Food.

39:00.924 --> 39:02.509
So, we’re gonna put
the paella out,

39:02.550 --> 39:04.344
we’ll go round the table,
all round the table with it.

39:04.386 --> 39:07.681
Oh, I thought we were gonna just
come and present it and be,

39:07.722 --> 39:08.973
like, here’s your chicken...

39:09.015 --> 39:10.183
Yeah, so, all round the table,
exactly,

39:10.225 --> 39:11.393
and then we go back
to the top bar...

39:11.434 --> 39:12.435
To the bar, yeah.

39:12.477 --> 39:13.853
and then we serve it on the...

39:13.895 --> 39:15.605
you’ll ask if they
want chicken or prawn.

39:15.647 --> 39:17.023
Then we’ll serve it and then
we’ll dish it out to them, yeah?

39:17.065 --> 39:19.025
Yeah.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.319
Okay.

39:21.361 --> 39:25.198
It’s unprofessional that
Dave’s trying to give me

39:25.240 --> 39:27.534
the cold shoulder just
from trying to set

39:27.575 --> 39:29.285
a boundary towards him.

39:29.327 --> 39:31.037
Our job is communicating,

39:31.079 --> 39:32.789
especially with these guests.

39:32.831 --> 39:34.207
-Is it clear?
-It’s clear now.

39:34.249 --> 39:36.042
-So, are we ready to start?
-Yeah.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.752
-See what I’m doing here?
-Yeah.

39:37.794 --> 39:39.379
We’re diamonding it off to say

39:39.421 --> 39:42.841
"We’ve been here, we’ve
touched your toilet paper."

39:42.882 --> 39:44.884
Do you guys not think
dinner’s taking a long time?

39:44.926 --> 39:46.386
You can speak up, like...

39:46.428 --> 39:47.971
-Well, it’s--
-Just pace yourself, it’s fine.

39:48.013 --> 39:49.931
-Like, relax, enjoy.
-But, like, really...

39:49.973 --> 39:51.558
Oh, they’re bringing sangria...
uh-oh.

39:51.599 --> 39:53.601
-Okay, we’ll ask him.
-What’s taking a while...

39:53.643 --> 39:55.437
yeah, it’s taking a
little while.

39:55.478 --> 39:56.938
No, Dad, at any restaurant,

39:56.980 --> 39:58.356
we’d be, like, what
the hell’s going on.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.108
No, it’s fine.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.240
Primary’s daughter
was saying, like,

40:07.282 --> 40:09.034
"If this was a restaurant,
he’d be complaining."

40:09.075 --> 40:10.243
Really?

40:10.285 --> 40:13.121
Yeah, so why isn’t
he complaining now.

40:13.163 --> 40:15.665
Primary’s daughter,
Lila, they’re not stoked.

40:17.125 --> 40:19.669
We’re gonna go to the restroom.

40:19.711 --> 40:21.254
I’m just annoyed,

40:21.296 --> 40:23.757
and at this point it’s
just, like, embarrassing.

40:23.798 --> 40:25.884
The service is supposed
to be seven-star service.

40:25.925 --> 40:28.053
It’s been slow as [bleep]
all night,

40:38.438 --> 40:40.065
What?

40:46.071 --> 40:47.238
Why?

40:55.163 --> 40:57.916
And the next course, how long...

40:57.957 --> 40:59.709
-when is that gonna be ready?
-Yes.

40:59.751 --> 41:01.711
I’ll go check in the galley.

41:01.753 --> 41:02.879
So, tomorrow, off the dock,

41:02.921 --> 41:04.381
or what do we think
about tomorrow?

41:04.422 --> 41:06.132
Positive thoughts
we’re getting off the dock,

41:06.174 --> 41:07.717
and we’re gonna be going
down that slide tomorrow.

41:07.759 --> 41:09.302
Hopefully.

41:09.344 --> 41:11.179
If you’re going on that slide,
you better have one.

41:11.221 --> 41:12.555
I have special clothes for that.

41:12.597 --> 41:13.640
Everything’s strapped in.

41:13.682 --> 41:14.891
There’ll be, like, duct tape.

41:14.933 --> 41:19.062
Okay, so three chicken...

41:19.104 --> 41:20.021
Sorry?

41:24.067 --> 41:25.735
It seems like there’s
some major tension

41:25.777 --> 41:28.697
between David and Natasha,
and I’m not sure why.

41:28.738 --> 41:32.742
So, I’m going to keep my eye on
them so they stay at that level.

41:32.784 --> 41:34.285
So, here’s the one with both.

41:34.327 --> 41:35.745
Oh, that’s delicious-looking.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.414
Oh, thank you.

41:37.455 --> 41:40.750
Tell me what you want as
we go, and then...

41:40.792 --> 41:43.753
Three shrimp, I think I said...
did I say?

41:43.795 --> 41:45.296
And two chicken.

41:47.966 --> 41:49.467
My rice is crispy.

41:49.509 --> 41:51.761
Dad, you probably
shouldn’t eat that,

41:51.803 --> 41:53.221
I don’t think it’s that good.

41:53.263 --> 41:55.598
I don’t think it’s
seven-star amazing.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.642
I think it’s good, I just
don’t think it’s, like, wow.

41:57.684 --> 41:59.269
It’s just, like, different.

41:59.310 --> 42:00.478
It’s not, like, what you’re
used to, I feel like.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.190
What?

42:07.819 --> 42:09.487
I’m not gonna say
sh-- now, yeah.

42:09.529 --> 42:12.949
I feel like telling Dave
about this paella right now

42:12.991 --> 42:15.535
is not gonna help any situation,

42:15.577 --> 42:19.456
because to make a new paella
would take around 45 minutes.

42:19.497 --> 42:21.708
And these guests clearly
do not wanna wait

42:21.750 --> 42:23.626
any longer for any more food.

42:23.668 --> 42:25.420
Sorry, it’s just,
like, oh, my God.

42:25.462 --> 42:26.796
It’s not the best thing
he’s made us yet.

42:26.838 --> 42:28.006
Yeah, no.

42:32.802 --> 42:35.180
Can I take anything else,
Dave, or is it all up there now?

42:35.221 --> 42:37.557
-That’s it for now.
-Okay.

42:37.599 --> 42:38.892
They’re eating away, yeah?

42:38.933 --> 42:41.686
Yeah, they’re all happy,
thanks, Dave.

42:41.728 --> 42:43.313
All right, good night,
everybody.

42:43.355 --> 42:44.606
Thank you guys so
much for dinner.

42:44.647 --> 42:45.899
-Bye!
-Thank you so much.

42:45.940 --> 42:47.525
-Good night!
-Keep it separated, guys.

42:47.567 --> 42:48.818
Wait, Isaac, remember, boys in
the bunk and girls in the room.

42:48.860 --> 42:50.612
You go to your room, and...

42:50.653 --> 42:51.905
Ai-yi-yi.

42:51.946 --> 42:53.531
Just keep the buns
in the bread aisle.

42:55.492 --> 42:56.826
What time do you
want me to go down?

42:56.868 --> 42:58.119
You guys...
you can go down now.

42:58.161 --> 42:59.829
Okay, they’re going down.

42:59.871 --> 43:02.332
Dinner was amazing.

43:02.374 --> 43:04.000
Kind of.

43:04.042 --> 43:07.003
Oh, she’s literally gorgeous.

43:07.045 --> 43:08.088
You’re so in love.

43:08.129 --> 43:09.130
Are you kidding me?

43:09.172 --> 43:10.924
You’re in love.

43:10.965 --> 43:12.550
Am I allowed to appreciate the
fact that somebody’s really hot?

43:12.592 --> 43:14.928
-Yeah.
-She’s very hot.

43:14.969 --> 43:16.471
Happy anniversary.
I love you.

43:16.513 --> 43:18.139
Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,
and if you do,

43:18.181 --> 43:19.849
-name it after me, okay?
-Nope.

43:19.891 --> 43:21.059
[laughing]

43:24.813 --> 43:27.107
Whew, what a night.

43:27.148 --> 43:28.900
-Good night.
-Okay, sweet dreams.

43:28.942 --> 43:30.151
Good night.

43:30.193 --> 43:31.152
You’re going to bed?

43:31.194 --> 43:32.612
See you in the morning.

43:32.654 --> 43:34.239
Is there talk of us going
off the dock tomorrow?

43:34.280 --> 43:36.074
I don’t think anyone knows,
to be honest.

43:36.116 --> 43:38.034
Can’t see it happening, but...

43:38.076 --> 43:39.619
See you later, tip.

43:39.661 --> 43:40.787
Yeah.

43:40.829 --> 43:42.205
All right, see you
in the morning.

43:42.247 --> 43:43.915
All right, thank you.

43:48.920 --> 43:49.879
[crash]

43:49.921 --> 43:52.382
Oh! Oh!

43:52.424 --> 43:53.258
What was that?

43:53.299 --> 43:54.592
-Nat!
-What just happened?

43:54.634 --> 43:56.594
-Oh!
-Kyle!

43:56.636 --> 43:58.263
Oh sh--.

44:00.598 --> 44:02.434
-Oh!
-Kyle has fallen.

44:03.893 --> 44:05.562
Ah, oh.
