00:06.799 --> 00:07.634
Alfred.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.385
- The manor.
- It's my fault.

00:10.803 --> 00:11.930
Mr. Cobblepot.

00:13.223 --> 00:14.140
(Oswald shouts)

00:14.307 --> 00:16.643
This never would have happened
if you stayed with me!

00:18.186 --> 00:19.812
You're having a baby
with Barbara.

00:20.230 --> 00:20.939
BARBARA:
You don't think I'm fit

00:21.105 --> 00:22.857
- to be a mother?
- What do you think?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.777
- You're leaving Gotham.

You found a way
out of Gotham?

00:30.573 --> 00:31.783
It's a submarine.

00:32.366 --> 00:35.036

You two here to pick up
your grandchildren?

01:14.158 --> 01:15.285
Come on, Babs.

01:15.451 --> 01:17.287
You got the only full bar
in Gotham.

01:17.453 --> 01:19.914
And if you two dinosaurs want
to keep coming here,

01:20.081 --> 01:21.749
you better up your intel.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.252

<i>ALFRED: Can you please repeat
your story for Mr. Wayne, madam?</i>

02:39.452 --> 02:41.829
We live in the shelter
on West End.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.915
There are so many of us
crammed in there.

02:44.082 --> 02:44.999
Uh...

02:45.583 --> 02:47.043
so much uncertainty,

02:47.377 --> 02:48.378
fear.

02:49.420 --> 02:51.631
And with the river poisoned,
it should've been awful,

02:51.798 --> 02:54.008
but... people came together,

02:54.550 --> 02:55.635
made it a home.

02:57.053 --> 02:57.804
What happened?

02:57.970 --> 02:59.847
<i>Couple
of weeks ago, we...</i>

03:00.014 --> 03:02.725
heard rumors about something
underneath the building...

03:03.184 --> 03:04.268
(exhales)

03:04.435 --> 03:05.728
...where it connects
to the sewer.

03:06.646 --> 03:08.648
<i>Then people
started going missing.</i>

03:10.191 --> 03:12.026
Hank, my husband,

03:14.153 --> 03:15.405
wanted to look for them.

03:17.407 --> 03:19.158
Said we were a family.

03:19.701 --> 03:21.828
So the two of you
went searching for them.

03:24.080 --> 03:25.373
It was so dark.

03:25.998 --> 03:27.333
I didn't see
what attacked us.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.501
(exhales)

03:29.210 --> 03:29.877
I hit my head.

03:30.044 --> 03:32.255
And when I woke up,
Hank was gone.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.051
Please, Mr. Wayne.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.680
<i>We have a daughter.</i>

03:42.014 --> 03:44.016
We'll do everything
we can.

03:50.648 --> 03:51.941
Should we tell
Gordon?

03:52.775 --> 03:54.277
He's stretched
thin as it is.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.904
Alfred, we don't know who
or what is down there.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.699
We know there's a man
down there, in danger,

04:00.241 --> 04:02.076
and we know this
lady sent for us.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.996
So go on, then. What do
you think we should do?

04:07.457 --> 04:08.875
Let's go find him.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.130
Under normal circumstances,
I wouldn't call you

04:14.338 --> 04:15.798
for a couple of stiffs.

04:16.007 --> 04:17.550
What do you normally do
when a couple of your patrons

04:17.716 --> 04:19.093
- get stabbed?
- Bury the bodies.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.178
Find out who did it and
then bury those bodies.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.347
See, that's not something
you should be telling a cop.

04:23.514 --> 04:24.974
We're living
in a different world, Harvey.

04:25.141 --> 04:26.392
GORDON:
So why did you call us?

04:26.559 --> 04:27.977
Take a look.

04:32.648 --> 04:33.858
Boggs and Lewis.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.485
You know them?

04:35.902 --> 04:36.569
They were cops.

04:36.736 --> 04:37.820
They were gone
before you joined.

04:37.987 --> 04:39.238
- What happened?
- They came around,

04:39.405 --> 04:41.115
peddling third-rate intel.

04:41.616 --> 04:43.117
It was closing time,
so I let 'em in.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.119
And then some other fossil
knifed them.

04:45.411 --> 04:46.162
You saw him?

04:46.329 --> 04:48.122
Yeah, he must've snuck in.
Looked like a cop, too.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.540
These two knew him.

04:49.707 --> 04:51.125
Bartender said
they called him

04:51.584 --> 04:52.877
Micks... Hicks...

04:54.086 --> 04:54.962
Dix?

04:55.129 --> 04:55.963
Maybe.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.132
No way.

04:58.758 --> 04:59.967
Dix was Harvey's
old partner.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.011
Well, there we go.
Case closed.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.388
So you're telling me this guy
rolled in here in a wheelchair,

05:04.555 --> 05:06.265
stabbed these two,
and rolled on out?

05:06.599 --> 05:08.059
He wasn't in a wheelchair.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.560
Then it couldn't be Dix.
He's been paralyzed

05:09.727 --> 05:10.937
for the last 15 years.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.898
Harvey, you're confusing me
with someone who cares.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.608
I called you as a courtesy.
And now I'm wishing

05:15.817 --> 05:17.485
I just dumped these two
corpses in an alley.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.029
Do we even know
if Dix is still in Gotham

05:20.196 --> 05:21.697
after the bridges blew?

05:22.406 --> 05:24.867
I heard he moved into an
apartment about a year ago.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.496
I meant to check up on him,
but... it can't be him.

05:28.663 --> 05:30.456
I hear what you're saying,
but we should still talk to him.

05:30.623 --> 05:31.874
Maybe he knows something.

05:32.959 --> 05:33.960
Fine.

05:42.051 --> 05:42.844
(sighs)

05:43.010 --> 05:44.178
How are you feeling?

05:44.345 --> 05:45.805
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

05:46.180 --> 05:46.973
Look,

05:47.640 --> 05:48.641
I've been giving you space,

05:48.808 --> 05:50.351
but we have to talk
about how this is gonna work.

05:50.476 --> 05:51.811
I'm gonna be a part
of this kid's life.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.563
Oh, you seem pretty confident
about that.

05:53.938 --> 05:54.939
I am.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.566
Reunification's gonna happen.

05:56.732 --> 05:57.733
You should think
about what kind of person

05:57.900 --> 05:59.151
you want to be when it does.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.655
It's a chance
for you to start anew.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.032
I like who I am.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.868
Uh-huh.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.919

06:40.401 --> 06:41.694
You were due hours ago.

06:41.861 --> 06:43.321
Yes, I was.

06:43.738 --> 06:45.031
But I had to get us lunch.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.575
- And I met Dale.
- I see that.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.410
Do you see this?

06:49.994 --> 06:52.580
Our secret plan
to get off this island.

06:52.872 --> 06:53.706
Relax.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.833
Dale is
completely trustworthy.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.461
How do you know we can trust him
if you just met him?

06:58.628 --> 07:01.297
Because he's mute
and dumb as a post.

07:02.006 --> 07:05.134
Look, I know you're paranoid
about people watching us.

07:05.301 --> 07:07.345
Someone is watching us!

07:07.553 --> 07:10.139
Why do you think I installed
this alarm system?

07:11.182 --> 07:12.016
(Oswald chuckles)

07:12.141 --> 07:13.476
And as safe as I feel

07:13.643 --> 07:15.728
with yourjingle bell
contraption in place,

07:15.937 --> 07:17.897
I went out
and procured us some muscle.

07:18.064 --> 07:19.273
You're welcome.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.068
(quietly): At least
you're doing something.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.653
Ah.

07:23.903 --> 07:25.529
<i>How's</i> my SS <i>Gertrud</i>

07:25.696 --> 07:27.865

07:28.032 --> 07:30.409
is coming along
just fine, thank you.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.161
I've been working
on the sonar,

07:32.662 --> 07:33.955
which, turns out, is...

07:34.705 --> 07:36.582
far more complex
than I anticipated.

07:36.749 --> 07:39.085
Well, I am confident
you will figure it out.

07:42.213 --> 07:43.756
Of course I will figure it out.

07:44.966 --> 07:47.426
Because I figure
everything out.

07:48.219 --> 07:49.637
The navigation system.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.472
The oxygen exchange.

07:52.223 --> 07:53.641
I will figure everything out,

07:53.808 --> 07:56.143
because I'm the
only one working!

07:56.644 --> 07:58.604
This was supposed
to be a partnership.

07:58.771 --> 07:59.981
It is!

08:00.147 --> 08:01.399
I already did my part

08:01.565 --> 08:03.275
by stealing everything valuable
in Gotham,

08:03.442 --> 08:04.402
of which you get half!

08:04.568 --> 08:05.236
No!

08:05.736 --> 08:06.821
Your goons stole it,

08:06.988 --> 08:08.155

expecting, Oswald?

08:13.744 --> 08:15.162
I told you
someone's watching us.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.456
Dale, go do
what I pay you for.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.794
Protect us!

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
Wait!

08:42.773 --> 08:45.109

I-l was there.

08:46.193 --> 08:46.902
This whole time,

08:48.237 --> 08:51.449
but you're alive!

be too careful.

10:25.709 --> 10:27.294
Figured you forgot about me.

10:28.045 --> 10:29.046
Look, partner,

10:29.213 --> 10:30.881
when the bridges came down,
I got busy and...

10:31.048 --> 10:32.049
Oh, sure, sure.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.467
You forgot me.

10:33.968 --> 10:35.136
Everybody forgets.

10:35.845 --> 10:36.846
I didn't forget.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.598
Planning on taking a trip?

10:40.850 --> 10:41.851
Maybe.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.687
I like to keep a bag
packed, just in case.

10:44.854 --> 10:46.230
Yeah? Where were
you last night?

10:46.397 --> 10:47.439
Where was I?

10:47.898 --> 10:49.108
I was right here.

10:49.275 --> 10:50.317
Anybody else
here with you?

10:50.484 --> 10:51.902
Anybody that can
back up your story?

10:52.862 --> 10:55.156
You're asking me
if I was out there killing

10:55.322 --> 10:56.448
Boggs and Lewis?

10:59.451 --> 11:01.954
Does it look like I was out
there killing Boggs and Lewis?

11:02.121 --> 11:03.164
So you heard
about that?

11:03.956 --> 11:05.249
Let me tell you something.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.709
If it meant

11:06.876 --> 11:09.670
that I can get out of
this son of a bitch wheelchair,

11:09.837 --> 11:13.841
I would confess right here
and now to Boggs, to Lewis,

11:14.133 --> 11:15.759
to anybody you want me
to confess to.

11:15.968 --> 11:18.387
All right, fine.
But you were a detective.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.680
What would you say
if you were us?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.724
We come in here, you're
packing a suitcase.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.979
I would say either I did it,
which I didn't,

11:27.313 --> 11:30.816
or I'd be very worried
that I'd be next.

11:31.650 --> 11:32.776
What do you mean,
you being next?

11:32.943 --> 11:34.653
What's your connection
to Boggs and Lewis?

11:36.947 --> 11:38.240
Come on. What?

11:39.033 --> 11:42.620
Nothing. I just worked
with them. That's it.

11:44.455 --> 11:47.041
We, uh... we worked
a case together.

11:49.001 --> 11:49.877
The four of you?

11:50.169 --> 11:51.003
BULLOCK:
Yeah.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.131
- <i>(bird cooing)</i> - <i>Dix
wasn't my partner then.</i>

11:54.298 --> 11:55.841
I was a rookie cop.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.635
Wet behind the ears.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.886
So what was the case?

11:59.303 --> 12:00.554
Woman killed her husband.

12:00.721 --> 12:03.057
As far as I can remember,
it was pretty open and shut.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.393
But at least we can agree
that Dix didn't walk

12:06.560 --> 12:08.479
into The Sirens
and stab those two guys.

12:08.646 --> 12:12.858
So who did? Barbara said Boggs
and Lewis recognized the killer.

12:13.359 --> 12:14.360
They called him "Dix."

12:14.526 --> 12:17.321
We come in here, he's packing
a suitcase, he shoots at us.

12:17.488 --> 12:18.322
This stinks, Harvey.

12:18.489 --> 12:19.823
(knocking at door)

12:22.409 --> 12:23.911
(knocking continues)

12:24.078 --> 12:26.121
(wheels squeaking)

12:26.288 --> 12:28.582
Hey. (grunts)

12:30.876 --> 12:32.711
(grunts)

12:36.799 --> 12:37.675
GORDON:
You all right?

12:41.512 --> 12:42.846
What the hell?

12:47.559 --> 12:51.230
(birds squawking)

12:51.397 --> 12:52.648
(footsteps)

12:52.731 --> 12:54.483
(water trickling)

12:57.194 --> 12:59.780
ALFRED: These basements run
along Gotham's sewers.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.324
The river is right next to it.

13:02.992 --> 13:04.952
You mean the river filled
with Jeremiah's toxins?

13:05.911 --> 13:08.038
Who knows what kind of damage
these chemicals could do?

13:08.831 --> 13:10.082
Yeah, you're right.

13:10.249 --> 13:12.459
(rats squeaking)

13:12.710 --> 13:14.586
Just don't you touch anything.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.549
(low growling)

13:21.760 --> 13:22.970
(water dripping)

13:23.053 --> 13:24.596
(footsteps)

13:29.184 --> 13:30.394
<i>ALFRED:
Hold on.</i>

13:41.155 --> 13:42.114
Oh.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.742
Bite marks.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.245
Animal?

13:48.370 --> 13:50.164
Well, it's no human
I've ever seen.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.624
Whatever it was...

13:55.002 --> 13:56.170
<i>...it dragged him that way.</i>

13:58.756 --> 14:00.716
Seems like human skin.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.801
Here's the file you asked for.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.428
Victoria Cartwright.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.847
- How'd you, uh...?
- I had Harper

14:07.014 --> 14:08.599
run every case the
four of you worked,

14:08.766 --> 14:11.310
cross-referenced with any woman
that killed her husband.

14:12.061 --> 14:13.729
Do I need to read it, or are
you gonna tell me what's in it?

14:14.646 --> 14:16.273
Victoria Cartwright
was a banker.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.150
She led a very boring life.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.027
<i>DIX:
Until she snapped and</i>

14:20.194 --> 14:22.821
put two .38 caliber slugs
into her husband.

14:23.364 --> 14:24.365
End of story.

14:25.657 --> 14:26.742
You guys
rehearse that?

14:31.413 --> 14:33.248
Says there was no
physical evidence.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.917
She was convicted
on the statement

14:35.084 --> 14:37.127
of her seven-year-old
daughter, Jane.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.296
This was 20 years ago.
Where's Jane now?

14:39.505 --> 14:41.215
What's the point?
The killer's a man.

14:41.382 --> 14:43.384
A man that can
imitate friggin' faces.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.010
What was the name
of the guy that Strange

14:45.177 --> 14:47.429
got to imitate you?
A Basil something?

14:47.596 --> 14:49.098
That's who
we should be looking for.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.934
That was different, and you
know it. Do we have an address

14:52.101 --> 14:53.394
- for this Jane?
- No.

14:53.769 --> 14:55.270
But the family's old home
is in the Green Zone,

14:55.437 --> 14:57.856
- just east of the clinic.
- Jim, it's a dead end.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.525
Is there anything else
you want to tell me?

15:02.277 --> 15:03.946
You know what? Why
don't you hang back?

15:04.321 --> 15:07.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.
You benching me?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.743
Killer's still out there.
Keep an eye on your partner.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.045
<i>OSWALD:
Penn. Arnold.</i>

15:20.212 --> 15:22.756
It's... Arthur.

15:23.382 --> 15:25.926
(chuckling)
You're holding a doll.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.469
It's not a doll.

15:28.429 --> 15:29.555
It's a dummy.

15:31.140 --> 15:32.349
Oh, this is great.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.642
I'm going
back to work.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.477
- Excuse me.
- You're saying

15:35.727 --> 15:37.146
he made you come here?

15:37.312 --> 15:39.565
Mr. Scarf ace is very persuasive.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.817
(chuckling)

15:42.317 --> 15:43.402
Persuasive?

15:44.027 --> 15:46.697
He made me tell him
about your...

15:47.906 --> 15:49.158
(quietly):
treasure.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.119
Penn...

15:54.413 --> 15:55.873
I think you need a rest.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.917
And perhaps a psychiatrist.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.130
Then we can discuss
you resuming your former duties.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.133
Obviously, I won't pay you
for the time you were gone.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.010
Shut your piehole!

16:09.803 --> 16:11.555
This the one
you were telling me about?

16:11.722 --> 16:13.557
Punk who thinks
he's in charge?

16:13.724 --> 16:14.641
Yes, sir.

16:14.808 --> 16:16.560
That's Mr. Cobblepot.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.480
Oswald, if you don't
make him leave, I will.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.816
- Yeah.
- No one's going anywheres.

16:23.400 --> 16:24.193
Penn,

16:24.359 --> 16:27.112
show these dewdroppers
we're serious.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.282
Forgive me.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.912
(gunshot)
(cries out)

16:37.164 --> 16:38.749
(Oswald panting)

16:39.041 --> 16:41.710
Now, let's
talk turkey...

16:42.419 --> 16:43.420
turkeys.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.633
(indistinct chatter, typing)

16:48.926 --> 16:51.053
- What a mess, huh?
- Yeah.

16:51.220 --> 16:54.848
(sighs) Boggs and Lewis were
idiots, complete idiots.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.643
They should've known when
they see a guy walking,

16:57.809 --> 16:58.977
that it ain't me.

17:00.771 --> 17:02.606
You think the Cartwright girl
said something?

17:03.190 --> 17:04.358
How would I know?

17:07.486 --> 17:09.820
So, how you been
since the bridges came down?

17:10.821 --> 17:12.156
You getting enough food?

17:12.324 --> 17:13.575
Medicine?

17:13.742 --> 17:15.202
What if I said "no"?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.454
I'd feel like crap.

17:18.789 --> 17:19.790
Then no.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.416
(chuckling)

17:24.502 --> 17:26.213
The Cartwright girl is dead.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.590
A buddy of mine,

17:28.757 --> 17:31.510
who was a screw
over at Arkham, he said

17:31.677 --> 17:33.887
she was an inmate there, and
she died a couple of years ago,

17:34.054 --> 17:36.348
so this has nothing
to do with her.

17:39.518 --> 17:42.938
(crows cawing)

17:44.356 --> 17:46.817

17:48.652 --> 17:49.945

17:51.530 --> 17:52.531

18:03.041 --> 18:04.376

18:17.514 --> 18:18.515
HARPER: <i>Looks like this place</i>

18:18.682 --> 18:20.809

21:22.657 --> 21:24.284
You're gonna have to
take that mask off.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.331
The only way you're gonna keep
that mask on is if you talk.

<i>Otherwise,

Nobody.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.843
You're not Jane Cartwright?

21:43.637 --> 21:45.555
Because you were
in her childhood home.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.517
You're about the right age.

21:49.476 --> 21:50.769
Talk to me, Jane.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.939
I know after
your mother

21:54.105 --> 21:56.191
was convicted, you ended up
a ward of the state.

<i>In and out of institutions

22:01.404 --> 22:02.614

<i>What happened to you?</i>

Okay.

22:18.672 --> 22:19.673
What happened to Jane?

22:22.259 --> 22:23.510
<i>Oh.</i>

22:27.722 --> 22:30.183
Lots happened to Jane.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.813
She was taken from Arkham.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.191
Down, down...

22:38.733 --> 22:40.360
down, the doctor
did things to her,

22:40.527 --> 22:42.237
experiments on her and others.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.407
You're talking
about Hugo Strange?

22:45.949 --> 22:47.492
You were taken
to Indian Hill?

22:48.159 --> 22:51.246
The professor was obsessed
with the power to change.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.165
The way a chameleon
would change its skin.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.710
He wanted humans
to have that power.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.338
He made it so Jane
could change her skin...

23:00.839 --> 23:03.592
her bones, her hair,
the color of her eyes.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.844
All it takes is a single touch,

23:06.011 --> 23:08.013
and her body becomes a mirror.

23:09.639 --> 23:12.350
When it's done, she sheds
her skin and starts anew.

23:14.769 --> 23:17.522
It remembers
everyone it touched.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.861
It's touched you, Detective.

Jane Cartwright is dead.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.039
She died in Arkham.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.961
That's when Jane Doe was born.

23:42.839 --> 23:44.299
So why kill all these cops?

23:47.218 --> 23:49.137
Do you want to know
why they died?

24:40.438 --> 24:41.982
(growling nearby)

24:44.275 --> 24:45.777
(whispers):
What is that?

24:55.537 --> 24:56.454
(quietly):
Aw.

24:57.497 --> 24:58.790
We should head out.

24:59.207 --> 25:00.375
My battery's dying. (grunts)

25:00.542 --> 25:04.087
(grunting, yelling)

25:05.171 --> 25:07.424
(gasping) Please.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.134
He's coming. He's coming.

25:09.300 --> 25:10.343
Who's coming?
What happened?

25:10.510 --> 25:11.511
He's going to kill me.

25:11.678 --> 25:13.221
(panting):
I barely got away.

25:14.973 --> 25:15.932
Are you Hank?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.058
Yes.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.601
<i>ALFRED:
Your wife sent us.</i>

25:18.768 --> 25:20.228
Is anyone else left alive
down here?

25:20.395 --> 25:22.480
- They're all dead.
- (growling nearby)

25:22.856 --> 25:25.025
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.235
(panting):
Oh, God. Oh, God.

25:27.402 --> 25:29.195
(low growling)

25:29.279 --> 25:30.280
<i>Oh, God.</i>

25:32.323 --> 25:34.367
(low growling continues)

25:36.244 --> 25:38.538
(low growling)

25:42.542 --> 25:45.253
(roars)

25:48.798 --> 25:51.760
(Hank screaming)

25:53.803 --> 25:54.512
ALFRED:
Hank!

25:54.679 --> 25:56.598
- Hank! Hold on, Hank!
- (Hank screaming)

26:00.518 --> 26:02.854
(Scarf ace chuckles)

26:03.438 --> 26:05.148
Hand over the heaters!

26:05.315 --> 26:06.733
If you don't mind.

26:07.525 --> 26:10.695
Mr. Penn, can't we
just talk this through?

26:10.862 --> 26:12.572
- (gunshot)
- Get back!

26:13.239 --> 26:14.532
I'm so sorry.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.620
At least tell me what
happened after Haven.

26:18.787 --> 26:21.081
Help me to
understand...

26:21.164 --> 26:22.332
this.

26:23.792 --> 26:25.251
Go on.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.755
Sing your song.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.634
After I was shot...

26:34.010 --> 26:36.221
I woke up in
the GCPD morgue.

26:36.971 --> 26:38.223
<i>I was alone.</i>

26:38.932 --> 26:42.519
I patched my wounds
as best I could and crawled out.

26:43.853 --> 26:44.979
I hid in a store.

26:45.855 --> 26:48.733
An abandoned magic shop.

26:48.900 --> 26:52.529
That's where
Mr. Scarf ace found me.

26:53.071 --> 26:56.783
And he told me all about you.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.911
How you used him.

27:00.370 --> 27:01.371
Chewed him up

27:01.538 --> 27:03.248
and spat him out.

27:03.832 --> 27:05.834
Treated him like a palooka!

27:06.000 --> 27:07.001
That's a lie!

27:07.085 --> 27:10.130
Oh, please, Oswald.
It's what you do.

27:10.213 --> 27:11.506
Arnold...

27:12.423 --> 27:13.424
Arthur.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.009
What do you want?

27:15.176 --> 27:16.511
I don't want anything.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.306
But Mr. Scarf ace, well...

27:21.724 --> 27:23.059
...he wants your treasure.

27:23.852 --> 27:25.270
And...

27:25.395 --> 27:26.437
to be boss.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.065
Flaughs)

27:29.691 --> 27:30.942
Really?

27:31.276 --> 27:35.363
The-the dummy wants to be
the boss of Gotham?

27:35.530 --> 27:37.991
Bingo!
Now, give me the key

27:38.158 --> 27:39.993
- <i>to your treasure room.</i>
- <i>Why would</i> I do <i>that?</i>

27:40.118 --> 27:41.995
You're obviously gonna
kill me anyway.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.205
What am I doing?

27:44.664 --> 27:46.374
I'm talking to a doll.

27:46.499 --> 27:47.709
Dummy.

27:47.792 --> 27:48.751
Seriously?

27:48.835 --> 27:49.794
You know what,
Oswald?

27:49.961 --> 27:51.462
Honestly, you
deserve this.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.131
Nobody asked you.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.549
You are
opportunistic,

27:54.716 --> 27:57.677
your loyalty is...
shaky, at best,

27:57.844 --> 28:02.056
and you will hurt anyone,
anyone to get what you want.

28:03.558 --> 28:06.144
I hardly think you're
one to throw stones!

28:06.477 --> 28:07.687
Listen, Penn...

28:07.854 --> 28:09.981
Eyes down here, pal.

28:10.148 --> 28:12.233
(chuckles)
Sorry.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.360
Mr. Scarf ace, I got
a question for you.

28:14.527 --> 28:15.904
Shoot
(chuckles)

28:16.070 --> 28:17.363
(chuckles)

28:17.947 --> 28:19.282
After you get your...

28:20.116 --> 28:22.035
tiny wooden hands
on that treasure,

28:22.410 --> 28:23.411
what are you gonna do?

28:23.620 --> 28:24.996
<i>Where are you
gonna go?</i>

28:25.163 --> 28:26.497
<i>People are gonna come
after you eventually.</i>

28:26.748 --> 28:29.042
Then I'll, uh...

28:29.209 --> 28:30.835
I'll take 'em all on!

28:30.919 --> 28:31.920
Yeah.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.296
Show 'em who's boss.

28:33.463 --> 28:34.464
Ah.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.008
You wouldn't
have to do that

28:37.217 --> 28:39.385
if you could get off this
island, now, would you?

28:39.802 --> 28:41.179
What are you doing?

28:41.346 --> 28:44.390
Shut it!
Let the smart one talk.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.394
How do you feel...

28:48.811 --> 28:50.813
about submarines?

28:53.983 --> 28:55.735
(indistinct chatter in distance)

28:56.194 --> 28:57.195
What are we doing here?

28:57.362 --> 28:59.530
I just wanted
to take us, uh,

28:59.697 --> 29:01.074
someplace quiet

29:01.866 --> 29:03.159
where we could talk.

29:05.536 --> 29:06.537
We did a bad thing.

29:06.704 --> 29:09.082
Oh, come on, not that again.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.668
We put a killer in jail,
all right?

29:11.960 --> 29:13.253
What do you keep
moping about?

29:13.419 --> 29:16.214
She was guilty.
She got what she deserved.

29:16.506 --> 29:17.507
Drop it.

29:18.216 --> 29:19.717
Did you get what
you deserved?

29:19.884 --> 29:21.261
What?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.430
You made that girl
into a murderer.

29:24.973 --> 29:26.266
Oh, come on.

29:27.100 --> 29:28.434
You...

29:28.977 --> 29:30.228
your friends...

29:31.104 --> 29:33.356
- the kid.
- Come on, you're...

29:33.523 --> 29:35.650
I'm gonna make sure you
never do that again.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.194
(grunting)

29:42.490 --> 29:43.950
Harper, where's Dix?

29:44.158 --> 29:45.827
I saw Bullock
take him in the back.

29:47.620 --> 29:48.830
Barbara. What are
you doing here?

29:48.997 --> 29:51.874
Seems my bartender overheard
the killer say something

29:52.041 --> 29:53.876
before he ice-picked
Harvey's pals.

29:54.043 --> 29:55.545
I thought I'd be a good citizen.

29:56.254 --> 29:57.380
Okay.

29:57.463 --> 29:59.299
"The kid's guilty, too."

29:59.799 --> 30:00.800
The kid.

30:02.343 --> 30:05.179
Listen... what you said before,

30:05.596 --> 30:07.515
about me being a known criminal.

30:07.682 --> 30:10.560
I was on some list your army buddy had.
When the government

30:10.727 --> 30:12.395
rolls in,
am I gonna be arrested?

30:12.603 --> 30:14.230
(sighs) Honestly,
I don't know.

30:14.397 --> 30:15.940
But that would work out
for you, right?

30:16.441 --> 30:18.443
I go to jail.
You get the baby.

30:18.818 --> 30:19.944
I don't want that.

30:21.070 --> 30:22.322
Is that a promise?

30:22.405 --> 30:23.698
<i>I go straight,
I'm clear?</i>

30:24.449 --> 30:25.533
Stay right here.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.536
Hey, Harvey,
where'd you take Dix?

30:29.120 --> 30:30.705
I didn't take Dix anywhere.

30:35.293 --> 30:37.295
Oh, God. Oh.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.883
She got into your locker.
Must have taken your clothes.

30:42.050 --> 30:44.052
We have to lock
down the GCPD.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.180
Hey, Harvey.

30:48.014 --> 30:49.223
We'll find her.

30:49.766 --> 30:50.767
Come on.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.398
(screaming)

30:57.607 --> 30:58.900
ALFRED:
Look at the size of it.

30:59.067 --> 31:00.985
(roaring)

31:01.152 --> 31:02.153
Living down here,

31:02.362 --> 31:03.196
the toxins in the river

31:03.363 --> 31:05.406
must have driven him mad.
Get out of here! Now!

31:06.657 --> 31:08.242
(grunting)

31:09.285 --> 31:11.079
(snarling)

31:11.162 --> 31:12.413
(claflg)

31:12.622 --> 31:14.123
(yells in pain)

31:17.293 --> 31:18.836
(metal shatters)

31:18.920 --> 31:21.172
(snarling)
(blows landing)

31:34.268 --> 31:35.269
Alfred!

31:40.191 --> 31:41.109
I'm sorry!

31:41.275 --> 31:42.151
Alfred!

31:42.819 --> 31:43.986
Alfred! Stop!

31:44.153 --> 31:46.656
(weak, raspy breathing):
Stop. Stop...

31:49.409 --> 31:51.786
(weak growling)

31:57.708 --> 32:02.797
All right, everybody, listen up.
GCPD is now in lockdown.

32:03.381 --> 32:05.758
Nobody goes in or out
unless I say so.

32:06.717 --> 32:07.802
She could look like
anybody by now.

32:07.969 --> 32:08.886
How are we supposed
to find her?

32:09.053 --> 32:10.721
(panting):
Jim!

32:12.140 --> 32:14.016
Barbara?
What happened?

32:14.934 --> 32:15.893
What do you mean,
what happened?

32:16.060 --> 32:16.978
I've been attacked.

32:17.145 --> 32:18.146
Where'd she go?

32:18.312 --> 32:19.105
Wait a minute.

32:21.107 --> 32:22.400
How do we know
it's really you?

32:22.692 --> 32:23.651
Seriously?

32:25.361 --> 32:27.029
This isn't proof enough?

32:28.239 --> 32:29.157
What the hell?

32:29.323 --> 32:30.199
That's her.

32:30.408 --> 32:31.993
She's the imposter.
Shoot her!

32:35.746 --> 32:37.165
It's me, you idiot.

32:37.665 --> 32:39.000
That sounds like Barbara.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.170
Barbara.

32:43.463 --> 32:45.047
Tell me where we first met.

32:50.261 --> 32:51.179
Don't shoot.

32:51.846 --> 32:52.889
I'm leaving here.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.808
Anyone tries to follow me,
she dies.

32:57.935 --> 32:58.811
Shoot her.

32:59.228 --> 33:00.354
We can't risk it.

33:00.730 --> 33:01.814
Stay back!
(grunts)

33:01.898 --> 33:03.232
(gunshon

33:05.943 --> 33:06.861
Bullock, wait!

33:08.613 --> 33:09.572
I'm fine.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.698
All right,
take her to my office.

33:10.781 --> 33:11.782
Don't let her out of your sight.

33:11.866 --> 33:12.909
- Qkay_
- (grunts)

33:17.663 --> 33:20.333
(dog barking)

33:27.381 --> 33:30.635
I cannot believe that you
told him about the sub.

33:30.843 --> 33:33.054
And that you're playing
along with his psychosis.

33:33.221 --> 33:34.722
Obviously,
he was gonna kill you.

33:35.348 --> 33:36.557
I bought us time.

33:41.145 --> 33:42.146
I have an idea.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.398
If you can just keep him busy
and wait for the signal.

33:44.857 --> 33:45.858
Wait, what's the signal?

33:46.025 --> 33:47.401
Quit your jawing.

33:48.736 --> 33:49.737
So...

33:50.530 --> 33:54.867
Mr. Scarf ace and I
have discussed our options.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.372
And the submarine
sounds like a good plan.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.082
SCARFACE:
And since we'll need

34:01.207 --> 34:03.584
the smart one
to build this hayburner,

34:03.751 --> 34:05.503
<i>he can keep sucking air.</i>

34:06.045 --> 34:09.005
But Penguin ain't so lucky.

34:10.257 --> 34:11.592
Do it, Penn.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.594
Ventilate that mook.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.558
I'm so sorry, Mr. Cobblepot.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.476
- Oh. - I wish things would've
turned out differently.

34:21.643 --> 34:23.521
Arthur, I want you to listen

34:23.688 --> 34:25.690
to what I'm saying.
You accuse me

34:25.856 --> 34:27.483
of manipulating you,
but what about him?

34:27.650 --> 34:29.735
I never asked you
to kill anybody.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.280
That is true.

34:32.362 --> 34:33.364
Hey.

34:33.447 --> 34:36.826
Think of everything
that we went through together.

34:36.993 --> 34:38.452
Sofia Falcone.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.330
Getting cut off
from the mainland. Starving.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.583
You mean Penn was starving!

34:44.166 --> 34:45.543
Fighting for scraps

34:45.710 --> 34:47.753
while your dog ate steak.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.797
I welcomed you into my home.

34:52.049 --> 34:55.511
And yes,
I was not a good friend.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.513
To you or to anyone.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.268
It's why I'm alone.

35:03.853 --> 35:06.606
But I saw you for what you are,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.649
and I valued that.

35:09.483 --> 35:10.276
Flaughs)

35:10.443 --> 35:12.570
That must be worth something.

35:15.197 --> 35:16.699
Applesauce!

35:17.491 --> 35:19.869
You're a liar and a thief.

35:20.036 --> 35:21.912
All you do is take,

35:22.496 --> 35:23.289
<i>take...</i>

35:23.873 --> 35:24.582
PENN:
Take.

35:25.541 --> 35:27.501
And you never give anything.

35:28.669 --> 35:30.296
<i>You worked me to the bone.</i>

35:31.005 --> 35:33.132
Forced me to be your puppet.

35:35.176 --> 35:36.260
Well, no more.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.515
You hear me?

35:42.642 --> 35:45.019
No more.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.731
- (sonar pings)
- (shouts)

35:49.482 --> 35:51.400
<i>SCARF ACE:
Take that. And that.</i>

35:51.567 --> 35:53.611
(both grunting)

35:59.450 --> 36:00.701
- No.
- (screams)

36:00.785 --> 36:02.161
(gunshon

36:02.244 --> 36:03.954
(panting)

36:05.164 --> 36:06.248
Mr. Cobblepot.

36:08.292 --> 36:10.378
You freed me. (chuckles)

36:11.253 --> 36:12.880
How can I ever thank you?

36:13.047 --> 36:14.340
(gunshon

36:15.216 --> 36:16.217
Aah!

36:17.134 --> 36:19.095
(Oswald panting)

36:20.137 --> 36:21.722
Why did you do that?

36:22.640 --> 36:25.226
- He wasn't the threat. The
dummy was the threat. - Oswald.

36:26.769 --> 36:29.647
I accept you for the
person that you are.

36:30.940 --> 36:33.192
Just as you accept me for
the cold logician that I am.

36:35.152 --> 36:37.071
That's why this friendship
is great.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.156
<i>And as friends,</i>

36:39.657 --> 36:41.742
I think we can both
agree that that lunatic

36:41.909 --> 36:43.285
had to be stopped.

36:44.120 --> 36:46.497
(chuckling softly)

36:50.376 --> 36:51.794
Perhaps, Edward...

36:52.837 --> 36:54.797
we really are meant
for each other.

36:55.506 --> 36:58.426
(both laughing)

37:06.892 --> 37:10.020
(floorboards creaking)

37:16.610 --> 37:17.653
Jane.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.535
I know you're up here.

37:40.259 --> 37:42.553
Jane. I knew
you'd be here.

37:44.388 --> 37:45.473
I'm sorry.

37:47.683 --> 37:50.060
It was my job to protect you,
and I let you down.

37:52.104 --> 37:54.231
You made Jane into a killer.

37:55.733 --> 37:58.652
You and your friends. There
have to be consequences.

37:58.986 --> 38:01.697
You killed three men already.
When is it enough?

38:03.657 --> 38:04.742
When you're dead.

38:06.410 --> 38:07.661
Put the gun down!

38:08.120 --> 38:09.622
Shoot me.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.335
You killed Jane years ago,
and you didn't even know it.

38:14.502 --> 38:16.295
Just shoot me.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.096
Let me see your face.

38:28.349 --> 38:29.642
Your real face.

38:30.643 --> 38:31.644
Why?

38:31.811 --> 38:33.854
(voice breaking): So you can see
what a monster she is?

38:37.274 --> 38:39.527
Hugo Strange
only destroyed her face.

38:39.693 --> 38:41.570
You destroyed her soul.

38:45.616 --> 38:46.909
Let me see it.

38:48.369 --> 38:51.163
(crying)

39:10.975 --> 39:12.142
<i>You see?</i>

39:13.769 --> 39:15.729
You see what they did?

39:21.569 --> 39:22.695
Jane...

39:25.030 --> 39:26.031
we can work this out.

39:26.240 --> 39:27.616
<i>Just put the gun down.</i>

39:28.033 --> 39:30.661
The only way this ends is
with one of us dead.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.931
Oh, Hank,
thank God you're alive.

39:51.140 --> 39:53.434
The nurse thinks the man that
attacked us will never recover.

39:53.976 --> 39:54.977
The toxins in the river

39:55.144 --> 39:57.062
have done irreparable damage
to his brain.

39:57.813 --> 39:58.856
I just think it's a
shame we couldn't save

39:59.064 --> 40:01.525
the rest of the people who
went missing, Master Bruce.

40:02.526 --> 40:04.069
We should've went to Gordon
from the start.

40:04.862 --> 40:06.530
- We were reckless.
- Ah, that's nonsense.

40:06.697 --> 40:09.074
We took decisive action.
We saved a man's life.

40:09.575 --> 40:11.327
The people in this city
have suffered, Master Bruce.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.913
They need someone that
will protect them.

40:15.831 --> 40:17.082
I agree.

40:19.043 --> 40:21.503
But there are better ways
to find absolution.

40:24.298 --> 40:26.091
I, um, I don't follow.

40:27.343 --> 40:29.053
What happened to Wayne Manor
wasn't your fault.

40:30.596 --> 40:32.556
<i>I know you've been
blaming yourself.</i>

40:34.308 --> 40:35.684
You didn't destroy our home,
Alfred.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.519
But I feel like I did.

40:38.395 --> 40:40.522
I feel like
I wasn't strong enough

40:40.689 --> 40:43.108
to fight Tetch
or that bastard Valeska.

40:44.652 --> 40:46.278
I feel like
because of my weakness,

40:46.862 --> 40:48.697
you lost your last tie
to the past.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.535
You lost your home,
Master Bruce.

40:57.414 --> 40:59.375
I must never be that weak again.

41:03.087 --> 41:05.714
Part of being a family
is that we can be strong

41:05.881 --> 41:07.424
<i>for each other.</i>

41:13.347 --> 41:15.474
And when did you get so smart?

41:16.225 --> 41:17.685
I had a good teacher.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.733
Victoria Cartwright
killed her husband.

41:25.609 --> 41:28.487
After we arrested her,
she admitted it.

41:28.988 --> 41:30.280
Later, she recanted.

41:31.865 --> 41:33.492
<i>But the physical evidence
wasn't there.</i>

41:33.659 --> 41:36.453
I was a new cop.
I wanted to make detective.

41:36.620 --> 41:37.871
So you leaned on Jane.

41:39.123 --> 41:41.709
Coerced a statement out of
her to put her mother away.

41:43.460 --> 41:45.254
The woman was guilty.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.424
<i>Later I found out
the husband...</i>

41:49.842 --> 41:51.969
beat the mother and Jane.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.555
I didn't know till after.

41:57.641 --> 42:00.644
The bartender overheard Jane
say something about,

42:01.311 --> 42:02.604
"the kid's guilty, too."

42:04.940 --> 42:06.442
She meant the young cop.

42:07.568 --> 42:08.902
She meant you.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.032
I knew something was wrong.

42:14.950 --> 42:16.326
I felt it.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.204
I said something,

42:19.371 --> 42:20.706
and they told me
to keep my trap shut,

42:20.873 --> 42:23.208
just close the case,
put a bow on it.

42:26.712 --> 42:29.089
After a while,
I stopped feeling it.

42:30.591 --> 42:33.218
And I went down that path
for a long time

42:33.635 --> 42:35.095
until I met you.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.144
However much I've changed...

42:43.228 --> 42:45.481
I can't change the past.

42:47.024 --> 42:49.109
I made that girl a killer.

42:51.779 --> 42:53.864
What do you want from me,
Harvey?

42:55.574 --> 42:56.909
Forgiveness?

42:59.661 --> 43:01.413
Can't give that to you.

43:03.957 --> 43:06.043
I just needed you to know.
