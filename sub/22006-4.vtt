WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.797
Previously on SEAL Team...
JASON: That's Ash Spenser's kid.

00:02.830 --> 00:05.298
My dad's book... I know a lot
of guys had a problem with it.

00:05.330 --> 00:06.763
His dad's only persona non grata
because he had

00:06.800 --> 00:07.630
the bad manners to write a book

00:07.670 --> 00:09.638
without being an officer.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.035
Look, if we're taking a break,
then we're taking a break.

00:11.070 --> 00:12.606
Problem was I was never here.

00:12.640 --> 00:13.800
No. Our problem is

00:13.840 --> 00:15.637
you're not here even
when you are here.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.147
You're a teacher?
A grad student.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.647
Literature.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.648
RAY:
Where's that blood coming from?

00:20.680 --> 00:21.578
l_\late's death
Isn't on you.

00:21.620 --> 00:24.180
Nate was hiding a burner
phone from his wife.

00:24.220 --> 00:27.815
You think, because Nate had a
phone, he was cheating on Molly.

00:27.860 --> 00:30.078
All the calls are to and from
one number.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.098
JASON:
It's the same address, Norfolk.

00:32.130 --> 00:33.722
What's in Norfolk?

00:40.500 --> 00:42.832
(rain falling)

00:42.870 --> 00:45.065
(thunder rumbles)

00:47.310 --> 00:49.301
(coughing)

00:50.710 --> 00:52.712
(crying)

01:02.330 --> 01:04.321
(man shouts in distance)

01:20.440 --> 01:22.442
(thunder rumbles)

01:26.520 --> 01:27.509
(rapid gunshots)

01:27.550 --> 01:29.541
(screaming)

01:46.240 --> 01:48.629
WOMAN:
Mr. Carter?

01:48.670 --> 01:51.434
Mr. Carter? Mr. Carter.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.700
Director Johnson
wrll see you now.

01:53.740 --> 01:54.707
If you follow me,
please?

01:54.740 --> 01:56.742
Thank you.

01:58.680 --> 02:02.741
We need to protect him
'cause he's an asset.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.588
I'm not arguing this
with you anymore.

02:05.620 --> 02:08.680
At the end of the day,
it's my call.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.722
Good. Then we won't
have a problem.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.921
When's the next time
you're gonna have comms?

02:12.960 --> 02:16.919
All right, Doug.
I'll talk to you then.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.926
I thought you were supposed
to say upstairs now,

02:18.970 --> 02:20.835
with the rest of
the elder statesmen.

02:20.870 --> 02:23.361
You cannot imagine just how
boring it gets up there.

02:23.410 --> 02:24.809
(laughs)

02:24.840 --> 02:26.307
So Doug's back
in the Tribals?

02:26.340 --> 02:28.274
Oh.

02:28.310 --> 02:31.802
Right. That's
individually cleared.

02:31.850 --> 02:33.613
You know the thing
nobody tells you

02:33.650 --> 02:35.311
about getting kicked upstairs
at this place

02:35.350 --> 02:37.318
is the higher you go,
the less you know.

02:37.350 --> 02:40.683
Look, Oliver, I'm actually late
for dinner already.

02:40.720 --> 02:41.914
Who are you meeting?

02:41.960 --> 02:44.485
You remember my friend Helen
from State?

02:44.530 --> 02:46.293
Oh, my God.
She's gonna kill me.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.649
How many times did I warn you

02:47.700 --> 02:50.692
not to let the Agency become
your one true love?

02:50.730 --> 02:52.766
That's awfully
heteronormative of you.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.836
How do you know Helen
and I aren't an item?

02:54.870 --> 02:58.362
Gonna move to the Berkshires,
open a pit bull rescue.

02:58.410 --> 02:59.672
Oh, God.

02:59.710 --> 03:00.802
I already have two
actual parents,

03:00.840 --> 03:03.274
so if you just came down here

03:03.310 --> 03:04.743
to talk about when I'm
gonna meet a nIce man...

03:04.780 --> 03:07.647
Mandy.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.649
The director just gave
the green light, finally.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.317
We're gonna go get him.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.713
The Butcher of Travnik.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.886
Baljic?

03:14.920 --> 03:16.785
The devil himself.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.627
And I want you
to quarterback it.

03:21.500 --> 03:22.797
I don't know what to say.

03:22.830 --> 03:24.388
I'm honored.

03:24.430 --> 03:25.692
(bell rings)

03:25.730 --> 03:28.893
MAN:
Now, Mr. and Mrs. Hayes.

03:28.940 --> 03:30.635
As your son Michael

03:30.670 --> 03:32.570
may have told you, we
like to view our, uh,

03:32.610 --> 03:35.602
disciplinary matters as just one
more opportunity for learning.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.574
Right. Teachable moments.

03:37.610 --> 03:39.612
That's not language
we use anymore,

03:39.650 --> 03:41.470
but that's essentially the idea.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.784
Look, who knows what
the world has in store

03:43.820 --> 03:45.344
for our young people
once they venture

03:45.390 --> 03:46.880
beyond our walls.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.525
We, uh, we can't anticipate
every situation

03:49.560 --> 03:50.720
they're likely to face,

03:50.760 --> 03:52.921
so what we try to do is, uh,

03:52.960 --> 03:55.599
give them the tools to-to make
the best decision

03:55.630 --> 03:57.518
no matter the-the circumstance.

03:57.570 --> 04:02.769
And Michael didn't make the best
decision given the circumstance.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.370
Fighting's never
the right decision.

04:05.410 --> 04:06.832
I'm sorry, who are you?
What do you do again?
Jason.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.768
Yeah.
You remember Mr. Fazzano.

04:08.810 --> 04:10.778
Michael's guidance counselor.

04:10.810 --> 04:11.902
Please, call me Keith.

04:11.950 --> 04:13.679
I'm sorry,
but you were telling us

04:13.720 --> 04:15.347
how it's not right to fight.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.813
You disagree.

04:16.850 --> 04:18.386
Well, it sounds to me like
the world that you're preparing

04:18.420 --> 04:19.887
your students for
is a world

04:19.920 --> 04:21.979
where, if you ask really nice,

04:22.020 --> 04:24.284
the bad guys
will leave you alone.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.729
Is that what you see?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.853
I fear that we've, uh,

04:27.900 --> 04:30.619
wandered some distance
from the pomt.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.036
As-as I was saying, because it's
the first time that Michael

04:33.070 --> 04:35.459
has exhibited problem behavior,

04:35.500 --> 04:37.536
we'll want to take a look

04:37.570 --> 04:40.778
at any recent changes to
the, uh, home environment.

04:40.810 --> 04:44.371
KEITH:
Now, we understand that the two
of you have been living apart.

04:44.410 --> 04:47.641
Uh, yes, for about
six months or so.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.443
And how does Michael
feel about this?
How do you think he feels?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.913
ALANA:
I don't think
I have to tell you

04:51.950 --> 04:54.783
how inexpressive
11-year-old boys can be.

04:54.820 --> 04:55.957
Believe me, Mrs. Hayes,
Michael is hardly the worst

04:55.990 --> 04:56.627
on that score.

04:56.660 --> 04:58.821
Mostly they grow out of it.

04:58.860 --> 05:01.829
Well, he seemed to be
taking it in stride, so...

05:01.860 --> 05:04.090
KEITH:
And in the months
since Mr. Hayes moved out,

05:04.130 --> 05:05.961
has there been any further

05:06.000 --> 05:08.332
evolution of the
domestic arrangements?

05:09.840 --> 05:12.570
Are you, are you asking
if we started dating?

05:12.610 --> 05:14.578
In _instances _
of marital separation

05:14.610 --> 05:16.646
children_ can become
hypersenSItIve to change.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.978
Right. Well, I suppose I can
only answer for myself,

05:19.010 --> 05:22.719
but as far as that goes,
the answer is no.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.844
No further evolution.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.118
KEITH:
Mr. Hayes.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.957
Same question.

05:28.990 --> 05:33.529
Has your domestic situation
recently continued to evolve?

05:33.560 --> 05:35.027
Mr. Hayes?

05:35.060 --> 05:37.062
*

05:46.610 --> 05:48.601
(grunts)

05:55.550 --> 05:56.949
Look, doesn't it bother you

05:56.990 --> 05:59.049
that_ our-our son_ is
growmg up at a tIme

05:59.090 --> 06:01.149
where he's taught not to
punch the bully in the face?

06:01.190 --> 06:02.953
Uh, not really.

06:02.990 --> 06:05.049
Besides, Caden's not a bully.

06:05.090 --> 06:07.991
He was_one of Michael's
closest friends all last year.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.965
As far as his mom and I
can put together,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.161
they got in some falling out
over a girl.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.031
Or maybe Xbox.

06:16.870 --> 06:19.668
Do you think Michael knows
that we've been...?

06:19.710 --> 06:21.632
What? Fooling around?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.148
Oh, is that what we're doing?
Yeah. (laughs)

06:24.180 --> 06:25.875
Mmm.

06:25.910 --> 06:27.719
I don't care what
you want to call It.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.787
All I know is that I want
to keep doing it, that's all.

06:30.820 --> 06:31.946
Why?

06:31.990 --> 06:33.810
Wh...? I didn't
even really think

06:33.860 --> 06:34.952
that would need
an explanation.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.958
Okay. I'm saying...

06:36.990 --> 06:39.458
what's changed?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.058
We started missing each other?

06:41.100 --> 06:42.863
(laughs)
I feel like,

06:42.900 --> 06:44.527
Ifeel like I'm 15 again
and we're in the back

06:44.570 --> 06:45.969
of your uncle's truck.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.934
You still look the same.

06:47.970 --> 06:51.906
Yeah.
That's kind of the problem.

06:51.940 --> 06:56.070
You look the same, too,
but you're not.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.977
Jason,

06:59.010 --> 07:02.639
when you first
started deploying,

07:02.690 --> 07:05.716
hard as it was to have you
gone all those months,

07:05.750 --> 07:08.218
it was worth it.
(chuckles)

07:08.260 --> 07:09.921
'Cause I knew
you'd be back.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.928
(sighs)

07:11.960 --> 07:15.088
Then, somewhere in there,

07:15.130 --> 07:18.463
you stopped coming back.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.766
I don't know, Alana.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.835
I don't know.

07:24.870 --> 07:26.929
I guess we're not 15 anymore.

07:29.710 --> 07:31.769
No.

07:31.810 --> 07:33.869
No, I guess we're not.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.946
OLIVER:
Luka Baljic,
Serbian weapons broker.

07:38.990 --> 07:42.084
We have reason to believe he's
the guy supplying the Taliban

07:42.120 --> 07:45.089
with the .50-cal armor-piercing
sniper rifles

07:45.130 --> 07:46.995
they've been using
against our APCs.

07:47.030 --> 07:48.588
Those are the weapons
that killed the four marines

07:48.630 --> 07:49.858
a couple weeks ago in Kandahar?

07:49.900 --> 07:51.094
Mm-hmm.

07:51.130 --> 07:53.234
Next shipment's a load of SA-7s.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.637
Baljic's due in Estonia in
72 hours to oversee delivery

07:56.670 --> 07:59.707
of his next shipment to his
runners, chiefly this man,

07:59.740 --> 08:03.540
Abukhan Kadyrov,
Chechen national.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.241
Ex-Excuse me. These guys
are shipping weapons

08:05.280 --> 08:06.975
to Afghanistan
via Estonia?

08:07.020 --> 08:09.784
They obviously don't know
how to look at a map.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.186
_ We're confident in our _
Intelligence and our analy5is.

08:12.220 --> 08:15.018
Where your expertise comes in
is coming up with a way

08:15.060 --> 08:17.028
to snatch Baljic that does
as little damage as possible

08:17.060 --> 08:18.880
to our diplomatic relations.

08:18.930 --> 08:20.591
Maybe I'm just
a little bit behind here,

08:20.630 --> 08:22.257
because Estonia's
still in the EU.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.598
Right? Why don't you just get
the local authorities

08:24.630 --> 08:26.894
to pick him up
and hand him over?

08:26.940 --> 08:28.168
There is some concern the
Estonians might be reluctant

08:28.200 --> 08:30.031
to arrest him.

08:30.070 --> 08:31.765
They're in a delicate
situation, diplomatically.

08:31.810 --> 08:35.268
Sadly, some Serbian hard-liners
still regard this guy as a hero.

08:35.310 --> 08:36.800
So, what, he
fought in Bosnia?

08:36.850 --> 08:37.999
Commanded a
Scorpion division.

08:38.050 --> 08:41.110
Oh, that's not good.
No.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.243
Baljic's personally responsible
for the murders

08:43.290 --> 08:46.748
of_ over a thousand
Bosnian Muslim CIVIlians.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.111
What? So he's an arms dealer
and a war criminal.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.628
At least he's not lazy.
Must be, like, what,

08:51.660 --> 08:53.196
20 years since we went
after a war criminal.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.652
Baljic's weapons
have killed

08:54.700 --> 08:56.668
dozens of American servicemen,

08:56.700 --> 08:59.965
which is why we now
consider him an imminent threat.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.106
1994, Travnik--
the massacre

09:03.140 --> 09:05.131
I told you about.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.671
Kandahan
two weeks ago.

09:08.940 --> 09:10.168
Take your pick.

09:27.660 --> 09:28.922
What's the security like?

09:28.960 --> 09:30.996
His protection detail's
made up exclusively

09:31.030 --> 09:32.099
of guys who served
under him.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.165
So they're war
criminals, too.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.736
He doesn't go anywhere

09:34.770 --> 09:36.032
without at least two
or three of them.

09:36.070 --> 09:37.332
Look, anyone want
to make a case

09:37.370 --> 09:40.203
for taking him
at the hotel?

09:40.240 --> 09:43.243
It'd be a tough sell
to Command, anyway.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.077
State Department's
real worried about

09:45.110 --> 09:46.816
the destruction
of private property.

09:46.850 --> 09:48.818
Oh, it's good to know
the priorities.
Hmm.

09:48.850 --> 09:49.885
Okay, we know the priorities--
hotel's out.

09:49.920 --> 09:51.217
Too many variables, right?

09:51.250 --> 09:52.786
We could wait till
he comes outside,

09:52.820 --> 09:54.014
nab him in the street.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.015
What if he
doesn't leave,

09:55.060 --> 09:56.288
only orders room service?

09:56.320 --> 09:57.628
Okay, look, anywhere else

09:57.660 --> 09:58.888
we're sure he's gonna be?

09:58.930 --> 10:00.056
Only thing we know
on his itinerary

10:00.100 --> 10:01.249
is the Kadyrov meet.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.289
JASON: We got
a when, where?

10:02.330 --> 10:03.820
Where's the Port of Tallinn.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.292
When's variable.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.763
It depends on when
the shipment arrives.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.665
Should be in the next 72 hours.

10:08.700 --> 10:09.906
Can we hit him in the port?

10:09.940 --> 10:11.202
Military's got security
at the port, right?

10:11.240 --> 10:13.674
MANDY: Mm-hmm.
(chuckles)
Good one.

10:13.710 --> 10:15.678
What?
I-I'm sorry, we're
supposed to be afraid

10:15.710 --> 10:16.870
of the Estonian military?

10:16.910 --> 10:18.798
RAY: It's not about
being afraid, knucklehead.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.841
It's about avoiding
the possibility some unluclq

10:20.880 --> 10:23.986
Estonian MP sticks his nose in,
gets himself smoked--

10:24.020 --> 10:25.908
poor son of a bitch ends up
starting a war.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.053
I'm just saying,
my money's on us.

10:27.090 --> 10:28.785
Okay, keep in mind
we're operating low-viz

10:28.820 --> 10:29.980
in a NATO country.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.986
That means no helos,
all indig weapons.

10:32.030 --> 10:34.919
So we're talking Glocks and AKs?
Sounds about right.

10:34.960 --> 10:37.292
Hit him in transit,
vehicle to vehicle.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.763
Whoa.
RAY:
Yeah?

10:38.800 --> 10:40.131
Kickin' it old school.
JASON: That's right.

10:40.170 --> 10:41.432
Seriously, when's
the last time we ran

10:41.470 --> 10:42.835
a vehicle-based vehicle
interdiction?

10:42.870 --> 10:44.929
Ah, man, it's like
riding a bike, Davis.

10:44.970 --> 10:46.267
JASON: It's like riding bikes.
RAY: I'm on point.

10:46.310 --> 10:48.335
JASON: You're not on point.
I'm on point!

10:48.380 --> 10:49.631
JASON:
No, you're not.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.941
Hey.

10:53.980 --> 10:55.174
What's the deal
with Oliver?

10:55.220 --> 10:56.812
What's his story?

10:56.850 --> 10:57.919
He mentored me through
my first posting,

10:57.950 --> 10:59.679
fresh out off the Farm.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.051
Always hitting us
with these little nuggets

11:01.090 --> 11:03.684
of intel wisdom he'd found.
Right.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.880
Rogers' "Rules of Ranging"?
Among others, yeah.

11:05.930 --> 11:09.320
Some of that stuff, I'm
pretty sure he just made up.
Yeah.

11:09.360 --> 11:12.898
He's a bit, uh, senior
for deploying, don't you think?

11:12.940 --> 11:15.238
(chuckles)
Oliver spent

11:15.270 --> 11:17.864
about four years
chasing Baljic in the '905.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.879
And then 9/11, suddenly,
no one cared about a target

11:20.910 --> 11:23.344
unless you could show a nexus
with international terror.

11:23.380 --> 11:25.701
So Baljic is "the
one that got away"?

11:25.750 --> 11:28.071
Pretty much.
And, trust me,

11:28.120 --> 11:30.714
you don't have to worry
about Oliver's objectivity.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.752
I trust you.

11:36.090 --> 11:38.183
STELLA: You know, it's come
to my attention that, um...

11:38.230 --> 11:42.189
that there's a guy
with your same last name

11:42.230 --> 11:44.221
is giving a reading
in Norfolk tomorrow

11:44.270 --> 11:46.295
from his,
uh, his book

11:46.330 --> 11:50.767
about his legendary career
as a... as a Naw SEAL.

11:50.810 --> 11:54.075
Can I just assume
that that's not a coincidence?

11:54.110 --> 11:56.101
So, now who's
Dog the Bounty Hunter?

11:56.140 --> 11:57.903
You said that your
father was in the Navy.

11:57.950 --> 11:58.905
Yeah, he was.

11:58.950 --> 12:00.918
In SEAL Team Six.

12:00.950 --> 12:03.282
Yeah, it's actually... it's
not really called that anymore.

12:03.320 --> 12:05.880
Whatever it's called,
your dad is, like, a legend

12:05.920 --> 12:07.888
_ _ in the same _ _
ridiculously competitive unit

12:07.920 --> 12:09.478
that you're trying to get into.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.488
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Again...
(clears throat)

12:11.530 --> 12:14.920
look, my, um, my selection
and-and training status

12:14.960 --> 12:17.497
is, like... it's really...
it's not something

12:17.530 --> 12:19.225
that I'm supposed to divulge,
so if you could just, like...

12:19.270 --> 12:21.033
(chopping sound)
just let that go.

12:21.070 --> 12:23.504
You know I minored in
psych as an undergrad?

12:23.540 --> 12:26.168
Yeah, you mentioned it.

12:27.910 --> 12:30.049
Why? Is-is this the part
where you're gonna tell me

12:30.080 --> 12:32.048
that what I'm really training
for is to kill my father

12:32.080 --> 12:34.810
and replace him
in my mother's affections?

12:35.820 --> 12:37.913
So, you gonna go?

12:37.950 --> 12:40.214
To the reading?
Mm-hmm.

12:40.260 --> 12:44.082
Um, I mean, I... wasn't
really planning on it.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.324
How come?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.794
Because I already know
what happens in the book.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.127
I don't.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.039
Come on, we'll go together.

12:55.070 --> 12:58.039
It'll be fun. Iwant
to meet the famous dad.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.038
You want to meet my father?
Mm-hmm.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.002
And this is, what,
like, our third date?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.005
This is a date?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.005
(chuckles)

13:05.050 --> 13:07.018
(chuckles)

13:07.050 --> 13:09.268
Seriously, though,
I want to meet him.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.185
Yeah, I'm-I'm sure
that you will, at some point.

13:11.220 --> 13:13.450
It just... You know,
this feels like...

13:13.490 --> 13:15.117
like maybe we ought to wait

13:15.160 --> 13:17.151
till we know each other
a little better.

13:18.190 --> 13:19.521
We should probably...

13:19.560 --> 13:21.027
know each other
a little bit better

13:21.060 --> 13:23.028
before we sleep together again,
right?

13:23.070 --> 13:24.298
No, no, no, no, no.

13:24.330 --> 13:25.297
I got to go. Excuse me.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.139
Hold on, hold on.
(squeaks)

13:27.170 --> 13:29.161
Hold on.
What?

13:29.200 --> 13:32.260
Boss, I'd like
to register a grievance.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.074
It's kind of
a human resources thing.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.907
Yeah, I'm all ears.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.542
This should be good.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.309
RAY: I've let it be known
for some time now that I find

13:40.350 --> 13:42.318
vehicle-to-vehicle interdictions
pretty damn badass,

13:42.350 --> 13:44.181
and if we ever got to do one
for real...

13:44.220 --> 13:46.518
Ray, it's a low-viz hit in an
area where you're not low-viz.

13:46.550 --> 13:49.155
Excuses.
ERIC: All right,

13:49.190 --> 13:50.179
let's cut the chatter.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.857
Let's do a run-through.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.893
*

14:01.170 --> 14:04.139
(tires screeching,
engine rewing)

14:06.510 --> 14:08.273
(gunfire)

14:19.420 --> 14:21.479
(shouts)

14:21.520 --> 14:23.886
*

14:25.160 --> 14:27.856
(tires screeching)

14:37.470 --> 14:39.609
24 seconds.

14:39.640 --> 14:40.607
Nicely done.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.437
(panﬁng)

14:42.480 --> 14:44.641
Let's get it under 20.
All right.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.171
Let's bring it back,
run through it again.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.181
I could do better.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.347
You forget that thing
we talked about forgetting?

14:52.390 --> 14:54.210
I can't remember.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.353
I'm being serious,
Jason.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.596
You already went.

15:00.630 --> 15:03.224
The address we found
in Nate's truck--

15:03.270 --> 15:05.568
you already went,
didn't you?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.534
(Ray scoffs)

15:09.240 --> 15:11.435
That's who
lives there.

15:11.470 --> 15:14.109
Well, Nate always had
good taste.

15:14.140 --> 15:15.630
Now what?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.571
(chuckles) I don't get it, man.
You find Jesus, finally?

15:21.620 --> 15:23.508
What do you mean, find Jesus?
What are you talking about?

15:23.550 --> 15:25.586
I'm just trying to understand
why you care so much.

15:25.620 --> 15:27.258
I mean, it's not like Nate
was the first teammate we had

15:27.290 --> 15:28.689
to get some on the side--
this only proves

15:28.720 --> 15:30.585
that he wasn't the exception.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.258
Or-or are you mad that he was
keeping a secret from his boys?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.120
It's not, okay? It's Alana.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.593
She keeps asking me
ifI know anything

15:36.630 --> 15:38.063
or if I found anything out.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.294
I don't know
what I'm gonna tell her.

15:39.330 --> 15:40.934
I-I have no idea.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.538
You know what, man,

15:45.570 --> 15:48.300
I don't know why lying
gets such a bad rap.

15:48.340 --> 15:51.070
I mean, you want to tell me
something that I can't change?

15:51.110 --> 15:53.271
Yeah.
Something
that's gonna cause me hurt?

15:53.320 --> 15:55.174
Lie to me, baby.
Well, whatever happened

15:55.220 --> 15:59.179
to, uh, "he who walketh
the path of deceit

15:59.220 --> 16:01.359
shall see the tongues..."
"He that practices

16:01.390 --> 16:04.154
"deceit shall not dwell
in my house, nor tarry
in my presence."
Yeah.

16:04.190 --> 16:07.159
Yeah.
Here's the thing, lying
is not necessarily deceit.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.350
Especially when it helps
protect a good man's memory.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.992
(sighs)

16:11.030 --> 16:13.191
Nate was
definitely a good man.
(bottle cap clatters)

16:27.580 --> 16:29.741
(indistinct chatter)

16:44.800 --> 16:48.292
Eyes on.
Target heading north into alley.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.229
Got him.
Heading towards the market.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.278
Paralleling you north,
west side.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.258
Target now moving west
through market.

17:23.170 --> 17:26.105
Sonny, he's
about 30 seconds out.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.428
(beeps)

17:56.370 --> 17:57.598
*

18:08.380 --> 18:10.382
Tracking device set.
On the move.

18:10.420 --> 18:12.115
Copy.

18:24.630 --> 18:28.236
Target is stopping at vendors.
Stand by.

18:32.210 --> 18:35.839
Target is continuing
through market.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.303
Three,

18:38.350 --> 18:40.318
two,

18:40.350 --> 18:41.510
one.

18:41.550 --> 18:43.438
You should have him.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.310
Got him.

18:45.350 --> 18:49.150
Target crossing Rava, westbound.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.225
Copy.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.619
Now crossing

18:54.660 --> 18:58.369
northbound on Allika,
east side of the street.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.561
Yeah, sorry.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.211
Where'd he go?

19:14.250 --> 19:15.444
We have a visual?

19:20.320 --> 19:23.289
I saw him enter the first
building off Allika.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.389
Can't tell which door
from my angle.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.227
Damn it.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.421
I can't get any closer
without drawing attention.

19:29.460 --> 19:30.791
All right, keep your eyes
on the doors.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.491
I'm coming your way.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.778
Brock, you got near, I got far.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.311
Sonny, hold tight
in case they come back outside.

19:51.350 --> 19:52.487
Copy.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.591
*

20:04.530 --> 20:05.622
All call, break.

20:05.670 --> 20:07.490
Repeat, break contact.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.461
What's the word, big daddy?

20:11.510 --> 20:13.432
One of the bodyguards,
we know each other.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.539
We're burned.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.388
Jakub Kowal. Polish.

20:23.420 --> 20:24.614
We operated with him
in Afghanistan.

20:24.650 --> 20:26.618
13 years.
Polish Special Forces.

20:26.650 --> 20:27.753
He was with GROM?

20:27.790 --> 20:29.655
JASON: Oh, yeah.
Tough bastards.

20:29.690 --> 20:32.921
Appears Baljic's decided
to upgrade his security posture.

20:32.960 --> 20:34.052
Guy's the real deal.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.352
Damn shame he decided to work
for an ethnic cleanser.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.992
All right,
what does this do to the op?

20:38.030 --> 20:40.931
Anyone see a way
that we don't abort?

20:41.840 --> 20:43.398
OLIVER:
All right, look,

20:43.440 --> 20:45.738
y-you two are the ones
he knows on sight, yeah?

20:45.770 --> 20:47.476
Yeah, he knows
me as well.
All right, so we take

20:47.510 --> 20:48.772
the three of you
off the snatch team.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.869
Doesn't leave much
of a snatch team, does it?

20:50.910 --> 20:52.400
There's not gonna be
a snatch team.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.416
All right? Kowal is just
gonna keep him in that hotel

20:57.450 --> 20:58.781
till he takes him
to the airport.

20:58.820 --> 21:00.788
So we hit 'em on the way
to the airport.
VVhen?

21:00.820 --> 21:02.959
What do you mean?
VVhen?
VVhen?

21:02.990 --> 21:04.719
He means, when are
they going to the airport?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.955
Or do you know something
we don't know?
Yeah.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.322
All right, all right.
So, we watch the hotel.
How long?

21:09.360 --> 21:11.499
You keep him in there all week.
Yeah, during which time,

21:11.530 --> 21:13.589
he'll have those vehicles
make fake airport runs,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.596
keep us constantly guessing
whether Baljic's in one
of the vehicles.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.369
All right,
so we go into the hotel!

21:19.940 --> 21:22.033
Mossad did it a few years ago
in Dubai.
Mossad.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.877
It was an assassination,
with months to plan.

21:23.910 --> 21:25.878
And they still ended up
getting their pictures taken.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.775
RAY: Either way, the
target that they hit,

21:27.820 --> 21:29.469
they didn't know
they were coming.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.579
Kowal and his guys are inside
that hotel room right now,

21:31.620 --> 21:34.919
waiting on us, reinforcing the
doors, packing out the windows.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.053
OLIVER: How do you know that?
Because we know him.
We trained with him,

21:37.090 --> 21:38.955
we worked with him,
we fought alongside him.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.325
That's exactly what we would do.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.099
Davis,

21:45.130 --> 21:47.291
get me, uh,
Baljic's hotel number, can you?

21:54.040 --> 21:56.372
Go get him
at the hotel?

21:56.410 --> 21:59.447
It's been a while since I was
this close to the action, okay?

21:59.480 --> 22:01.516
It was the adrenaline.
I got carried away.

22:01.550 --> 22:03.381
Long as that's all it is.

22:03.420 --> 22:04.910
What does that mean?

22:04.950 --> 22:08.852
It‘s our careers.
It's their lives, remember?

22:08.890 --> 22:10.983
Of course I remember.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.554
Oliver, I know
you've been trying

22:12.590 --> 22:14.751
to get this mission green-lit
since '01.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.927
Just want to make sure,
now we're getting so close,

22:16.960 --> 22:18.894
you're not gonna catch
gold fever.

22:18.930 --> 22:22.468
I guess that you lucked out
with Samir as your white whale.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.764
Guy was a walking terror nexus.

22:24.810 --> 22:27.734
I mean, I bet you never got
turned down for a green light.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.930
Oh, true, I never had to talk
anybody into targeting him.

22:29.980 --> 22:31.902
Finding him was always
the hard part.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.542
Baljic was easy to find.

22:33.580 --> 22:35.013
Once he realized _
we changed our priorities,

22:35.050 --> 22:37.587
he came out of hiding
and went back to his old life.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.645
Figures as long
as he steers clear

22:39.690 --> 22:42.659
of any terror nexus,
the bill for those murdered kids

22:42.690 --> 22:44.920
will never come due.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.985
Oh, anyway.

22:47.030 --> 22:50.420
I suppose there's nothing
to do now but sit back,

22:50.470 --> 22:52.995
hope Jason's plan's enough
to stop Baljic

22:53.030 --> 22:55.430
from wriggling off the hook
yet again.

23:15.220 --> 23:18.553
Ash Spenser spent 15 years
in the SEAL Teams,

23:18.590 --> 23:21.889
the Tier One SEAL unit
formerly known as SEAL Team Six.

23:21.930 --> 23:23.966
He's the founder of Ash Spenser
Tactical Firearms Training,

23:24.000 --> 23:25.695
as well as

23:25.730 --> 23:27.493
Ash Spenser
Security Consulting

23:27.540 --> 23:30.100
and Ash Spenser Tactical
Security Solutions,

23:30.140 --> 23:31.903
as well _
as a frequent contributor

23:31.940 --> 23:34.875
on various_ cable news outlets
as a subject-matter expert

23:34.910 --> 23:37.606
on tactics and security.

23:37.650 --> 23:40.517
Ladies and gentlemen,
please help me welcome

23:40.550 --> 23:42.711
to _our Conversations
With Authors series

23:42.750 --> 23:45.878
a true American hero,

23:45.920 --> 23:48.411
Senior-Chief Ashland Spenser!

23:50.630 --> 23:52.188
Thanks, man, thank you.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.551
(audience members whoop)

23:54.600 --> 23:56.192
Well, that was quite a mouthful
there, Rick.

23:56.230 --> 23:58.221
Thank you
for that introduction. Yes.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.159
Um, you know, I was sitting
over there a bit concerned

24:01.200 --> 24:03.088
while I was listening
to that rsum

24:03.140 --> 24:05.165
that some of you might be
expecting Arnold Schwarzenegger,

24:05.210 --> 24:07.678
but you get little old me,
and you might be deciding

24:07.710 --> 24:08.972
that you're in
the wrong room.

24:09.010 --> 24:10.602
(laughter)
The truth is,

24:10.650 --> 24:16.941
most Tier One operators
aren't much to look at.

24:16.980 --> 24:18.641
No, we're not
superheroes.

24:18.690 --> 24:21.682
We don't look like
professional athletes.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.779
And we put our pants on
one leg at a time.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.957
Well, most of the time.
(mouths)

24:25.990 --> 24:28.129
So before we get started
this evening,

24:28.160 --> 24:30.151
I'd like to find out
how familiar the audience is

24:30.200 --> 24:32.020
with some of the subjects
we're gonna be touching base on,

24:32.070 --> 24:36.131
so, by a show of hands, how many
of you know what BUD/S is?

24:36.170 --> 24:40.732
Excellent. And that is why
I love reading in Virginia!

24:40.780 --> 24:42.771
(laughter)
(Ash clears throat)

24:49.050 --> 24:51.541
I appreciate the call,
but I was hoping

24:51.590 --> 24:53.148
you were only
here on holiday.

24:53.190 --> 24:56.512
Hmm. What gave it away?

24:56.560 --> 24:58.084
The umbrella in my drink?

24:58.130 --> 25:01.122
You're here for Baljic?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.822
What if I told you I wasn't?
Would you believe me?

25:03.870 --> 25:07.124
Eh, probably not.

25:07.170 --> 25:10.037
You used to hunt these guys.

25:10.070 --> 25:12.106
Yeah, that was
a long time ago,

25:12.140 --> 25:13.732
even before
you and I met.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.031
(sniffles)

25:15.080 --> 25:18.072
Now you're working for them.

25:18.110 --> 25:20.203
Ah, Baljic's not so bad.

25:20.250 --> 25:22.309
Never treats you
like a servant.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.648
Pours you one when
your shift ends.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.284
Even crack a joke
now and then.

25:27.320 --> 25:30.983
And his money spends.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.782
Most of the time.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.695
He trust a
profe55ional's judgment

25:34.730 --> 25:36.220
about where he
can and can't go.

25:36.260 --> 25:40.094
You didn't want him
to make the trip?

25:40.130 --> 25:42.166
Didn't want him to
leave Serbia at all.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.758
I could see that.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.062
No one's gonna go in there
after him and grab him.

25:50.140 --> 25:52.176
You know, you can still
walk away from this guy.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.075
Make it interesting for you.
Maybe get you a little

25:54.120 --> 25:57.009
bounty money.
(laughs)

25:57.050 --> 26:01.157
Be a blow to my professional
reputation, though, yes?

26:01.190 --> 26:04.182
You're really ready to go down
with the ship for this guy?

26:05.990 --> 26:09.926
It's a question for when
the ship is going down.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.359
Yeah.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.960
So far, all we've done
is spot the iceberg.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.128
You can't stop us
from taking him.

26:17.170 --> 26:19.764
I think I can.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.629
Let me ask you a question.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.602
Three years after leaving GROM,

26:24.650 --> 26:27.141
and here you are
working for the bad guys?

26:27.180 --> 26:29.148
Wait till you've
been out a few years...
Mm-hmm.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.613
...you've seen what
the options are.

26:30.650 --> 26:32.117
You want to go on
making a living

26:32.150 --> 26:33.856
using the talents
God gave you.

26:36.020 --> 26:38.887
You're a bodyguard
who works for a guy

26:38.930 --> 26:40.989
who massacres women and kids.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.718
(sighs)

26:45.770 --> 26:48.261
Didn't see Ray with
you this afternoon.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.303
Ray.
Decided to sit him out
of your little recce?

26:51.340 --> 26:52.762
Yeah, well,
you know what?

26:52.810 --> 26:54.675
He draws a lot of eyes
around here.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.234
This place isn't exactly
a melting pot.

26:56.280 --> 26:58.009
(sighs)

26:58.050 --> 26:59.642
Hope you'll give
him my best.
Mm-hmm.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.046
Thanks for the drink.
Yeah.

27:08.720 --> 27:11.052
He didn't go for it.

27:11.090 --> 27:14.651
We heard. Well, don't
tell me you're surprised.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.190
Tell you what.

27:16.230 --> 27:18.664
Gonna need you to book us
a commercial flight back.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.089
You and the guys aren't gonna
fly back with the rest of us?

27:27.710 --> 27:29.234
Thank you, sir.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.235
RICK:
This was great.

27:30.280 --> 27:31.941
Hey, Rick,
real pleasure.
Thank you, sir.

27:31.980 --> 27:33.174
Real pleasure.
Thank you.

27:33.210 --> 27:34.416
Ah!

27:34.450 --> 27:36.714
Alone at last.
(Stella laughs)

27:36.750 --> 27:38.240
You must be Stella.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.281
Uh, I'd better be.
Nice to meet you.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.719
Listen, I was warned

27:41.760 --> 27:43.955
that there were certain subjects
that, uh,

27:43.990 --> 27:46.049
should be
avoided tonight?
Oh.

27:46.090 --> 27:48.126
But there were so many of them,
ranging from politics

27:48.160 --> 27:50.424
to religion to baby pictures
of you know who,

27:50.460 --> 27:52.360
and whether or not I have
any of those on me--

27:52.400 --> 27:53.958
there's no way
I'm gonna be able

27:54.000 --> 27:55.365
to keep all that
crap straight.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.834
So, I'm gonna apologize
in advance

27:57.870 --> 27:59.804
for any offense
that I may cause.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.876
Thank you.
Right back at you.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.229
You know, uh, when
I first met your son,

28:03.280 --> 28:06.101
he tried to tell me
what "feminism" means?

28:06.150 --> 28:08.015
You're kidding me.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.249
Well, we haven't known
each other that long,

28:11.290 --> 28:13.781
but I don't think I'd be
putting myself out on a limb

28:13.820 --> 28:16.311
if I said that is not the way
to pick up on you.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.282
And yet, here we are.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.355
He was raised
better than that.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.255
How would you know?

28:24.330 --> 28:27.390
What my son is referring to,
Stella, is the fact

28:27.430 --> 28:29.830
that I was away from home
quite a bit,

28:29.870 --> 28:31.861
even before his mother
and I split up.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.832
Oh.
You see, being a father
and being a Navy SEAL--

28:33.880 --> 28:36.030
that's a contradiction.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.502
Doesn't have to be.

28:37.540 --> 28:41.215
STELLA:
Kind of like being a woman
and having a career?

28:41.250 --> 28:43.138
Right?

28:43.180 --> 28:45.410
Exactly.

28:45.450 --> 28:48.317
Where have you been all my life?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.351
Come here. Ah.

28:50.390 --> 28:52.381
We, uh... we finished here?

28:52.430 --> 28:54.057
(laughs)

28:54.100 --> 28:55.419
I like this girl.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.896
I hope to see you
again, young lady.

28:58.930 --> 29:00.932
Call me later.
We'll have dinner.

29:00.970 --> 29:03.336
All right.

29:05.470 --> 29:07.461
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

29:09.880 --> 29:12.246
We get free booze on this bird?
That's first class.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.542
Wait, we're not first class?

29:13.580 --> 29:15.411
Who said anything
about "we"?

29:15.450 --> 29:17.441
(laughs)
See, that's-that's
not fair, man.

29:17.480 --> 29:19.311
That's not fair, Jason.
It's okay.

29:19.350 --> 29:22.012
No, it's not okay.
(laughing):
Yes.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.051
(indistinct chatter)

29:51.320 --> 29:54.312
*

30:22.020 --> 30:25.012
*

30:34.160 --> 30:36.128
Good news. Looks like
your airport play worked.

30:36.160 --> 30:37.422
Kadyrov meet's
back on.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.122
Bad news--
Baljic changed the location.

30:40.170 --> 30:42.434
Instead of the port,
they're going to Freedom Square.

30:42.470 --> 30:44.233
It's high density,
packed with people.

30:44.270 --> 30:45.965
Well, he's awful careful.
I got to give him that.

30:46.010 --> 30:48.478
Yeah, Baljic probably figures if
if our airport play was a bluff,

30:48.510 --> 30:49.909
we'd be too scared
to grab him

30:49.940 --> 30:51.407
in the middle of
all those people.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.145
Guy makes his name
machine-gunning civilians,

30:53.180 --> 30:54.442
and now he wants
to hide behind 'em.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.471
From a diplomatic
relations standpoint,

30:56.520 --> 30:57.885
it's even worse
than the hotel.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.387
Fine. I'll tell you what.

30:59.420 --> 31:01.183
We just intercept him
before he gets to the square.

31:01.220 --> 31:03.188
Yeah, we do. Davis, give
me the current imagery.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.984
SONNY:
Vehicle to vehicle?
Just like we planned.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.429
Cue me up.

31:07.460 --> 31:09.348
All right. Any route
they take from the hotel

31:09.400 --> 31:11.493
to the square forces them
to go through this

31:11.530 --> 31:14.237
intersection right here.
SONNY: All right, this
is the channelized area

31:14.270 --> 31:15.897
right here.
Actually, you know what?

31:15.940 --> 31:18.033
Might be too channelized
in order for that to work.

31:18.070 --> 31:20.504
Yeah, what's that mess? Looks
like someone clacked off an IED.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.178
Looks like a construction site.

31:22.210 --> 31:23.905
Oh, you want
to talk about congestion.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.599
That's gonna make it real
difficult to get close enough.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.277
You're telling me. In the
middle of the city like that,

31:27.310 --> 31:29.517
right, the police response
is gonna be a lot shorter

31:29.550 --> 31:30.949
than we drilled for.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.480
We're gonna have
to speed up the V.I.
Yeah.

31:32.520 --> 31:35.080
Okay, what's your access
to vehicles around here?

31:35.120 --> 31:36.485
You got any preference
as to type?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.555
Heaw.

31:47.430 --> 31:49.591
(engine rewing)

31:55.680 --> 31:57.602
I'm here.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.608
How far out are they?

31:59.650 --> 32:03.108
About two klicks out.
Should be to you soon.

32:03.150 --> 32:05.539
Copy that.

32:32.010 --> 32:34.672
(door squeaks shut)

32:37.220 --> 32:39.688
Five blocks out, boys.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.359
It's go time.

32:54.040 --> 32:56.065
KOWAL:
Hey!

32:56.100 --> 32:58.239
(horn toots)

32:58.270 --> 33:00.738
(horn honking)
Hey, hey, hey!

33:00.770 --> 33:02.738
(honking)

33:09.120 --> 33:11.179
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

33:11.220 --> 33:12.983
Come on!

33:16.490 --> 33:18.481
Go time.
Three...

33:18.530 --> 33:21.351
two, one!

33:22.660 --> 33:25.299
(exclaiming in Polish)

33:44.720 --> 33:46.278
JASON (over comm):
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.548
Negative visual on the target.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.012
He is not in the vehicle.

33:50.690 --> 33:51.759
He's in the alley.

33:57.700 --> 34:00.396
TOC, target heading
north. In pursuit.

34:13.510 --> 34:17.048
*

34:45.250 --> 34:49.619
(panﬁng)

34:52.450 --> 34:54.680
Good to see you
again, Raymond.

34:54.720 --> 34:58.258
Of all the gin joints
in all the world, huh, Jakub?

35:03.700 --> 35:05.190
You don't want
to do this.

35:05.230 --> 35:06.868
Not for him.

35:08.400 --> 35:11.233
Lifeboat time.

35:25.350 --> 35:27.341
(speaking Serbian)

35:29.260 --> 35:32.252
(Baljic groaning)

36:05.260 --> 36:08.195
I know what you did.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.391
Well, that sounds
expansive.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.397
Who's Zaid Pashtan?

36:13.430 --> 36:15.330
He's a source.

36:15.370 --> 36:16.894
I've been reading his file.

36:16.940 --> 36:18.567
Turns out he is the only source

36:18.610 --> 36:20.498
says Baljic's weapons
are going to the Taliban.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.679
What about the intercepts?

36:22.710 --> 36:25.508
Couple of Taliban guys
talking on their sat phones,

36:25.550 --> 36:27.472
saying how grateful they are
about the coming shipment?

36:27.510 --> 36:29.341
That can mean anything.

36:29.380 --> 36:32.440
Intelligence analysis
is the art of pulling together

36:32.490 --> 36:33.684
various types of...

36:33.720 --> 36:35.654
He's you. Zaid.

36:35.690 --> 36:37.578
You made him up.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.850
Give Baljic a nexus with terror,

36:39.890 --> 36:41.653
green-light this mission.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.520
Luka Baljic is headed
to The Hague

36:43.560 --> 36:46.597
to be locked away where he can't
do any more harm.

36:46.630 --> 36:48.939
And to answer for the harm
he's already done.

36:48.970 --> 36:51.768
The world is a safer
and more just place now

36:51.810 --> 36:54.370
than it was yesterday.

36:54.410 --> 36:56.970
Doesn't matter how
we got here, we're here.

36:57.010 --> 36:59.274
You falsified intel.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.574
Those rockets were never
headed for the Taliban.

37:02.780 --> 37:04.884
of a European capital city?

37:04.920 --> 37:06.740
For even a small chance
of success,

37:06.790 --> 37:10.248
that op requires Tier One
operators.

37:11.490 --> 37:12.684
well, they're not
important enough

37:12.730 --> 37:15.449
to justify the use
of Tier One operators.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.751
The old men needed

37:16.800 --> 37:20.395
an imminent threat.

37:20.430 --> 37:22.694
Only way I saw
to check that box.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.901
You used me.

37:33.050 --> 37:35.348
Everything okay?

37:36.920 --> 37:39.013
Yeah. Fine.

37:39.050 --> 37:41.416
You?
Yeah, fine.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.695
You figure out
what you're gonna do

37:50.730 --> 37:52.027
about Nate's mystery woman?

37:52.070 --> 37:53.765
I think it's best
for all concerned,

37:53.800 --> 37:54.994
we just put it to bed.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.793
Smash Nate's burner phone,

37:57.840 --> 38:00.035
let all his secrets
just die along with him.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.709
I seem to recall advocating
for something

38:02.740 --> 38:03.775
along those very lines.

38:03.810 --> 38:06.404
Means having to lie to Alana.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.714
Well, you know, lying is not
necessarily deceit.

38:15.820 --> 38:17.048
CLAY: You're looking
pretty rough, huh?

38:17.090 --> 38:18.580
(laughs)

38:18.630 --> 38:21.019
Did you tie one on
again last night?

38:21.060 --> 38:23.893
Couple of the old guys
wanted to see me.

38:23.930 --> 38:26.899
It's not like we can go
hang out on the base.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.398
How's my girl Stella doing?

38:29.440 --> 38:31.431
She's fine.
She sends her best.

38:31.470 --> 38:33.802
She, um... she wanted me to
tell you she had a good time--

38:33.840 --> 38:35.728
she's sorry we couldn't
do it again last night.

38:35.780 --> 38:39.341
I told you you didn't have
anything to worry about.

38:39.380 --> 38:41.348
Everybody likes me.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.019
Oh, yeah.
So I hear.

38:44.050 --> 38:45.608
God...

38:46.950 --> 38:49.783
(exhales)
Those guys.

38:49.820 --> 38:51.424
They're so afraid
to be seen with me,

38:51.460 --> 38:52.927
I swear to God, the bar
they picked last night

38:52.960 --> 38:54.848
must have been
halfway to Richmond.

38:54.900 --> 38:57.357
Guess that's what they mean
by PNG'd, huh?

38:57.400 --> 38:58.992
All this over
a stupid book.

38:59.030 --> 39:00.122
(groans)

39:00.170 --> 39:01.797
I guess I should
just be grateful

39:01.840 --> 39:04.434
that they haven't tried
to stop you from seeing me.

39:04.470 --> 39:05.937
Yeah, well, you know,
Adam says he sees

39:05.970 --> 39:09.076
the persona non grata policy
as "don't ask, don't tell."

39:09.110 --> 39:13.001
Adam told me that you
were bottom-fived.

39:13.050 --> 39:14.847
Once.

39:14.880 --> 39:18.441
Well, I guess I owe you
an apology.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.811
I know being my son
makes you a target.

39:20.850 --> 39:23.683
This had nothing
to do with you.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.085
I just wasn't performing.

39:25.130 --> 39:27.826
I guess you would know.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.896
I mean, I'm just saying
it couldn't have

39:29.930 --> 39:31.488
helped your case any,
and the book tour

39:31.530 --> 39:32.690
coming through here
put me in front

39:32.730 --> 39:33.697
of everybody's mind.

39:33.730 --> 39:36.460
Yeah, well, I guess, uh...

39:36.500 --> 39:39.105
guess you could have asked
to skip one stop on the tour.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.835
You know, maybe just
held off reading here

39:40.870 --> 39:42.929
until after Selections
or till I get dropped.

39:42.980 --> 39:44.948
You're not getting dropped.
But, you know,
that would require you

39:44.980 --> 39:46.470
to consider someone
other than yourself.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.807
You know what, I was
just thinking

39:47.850 --> 39:49.477
I haven't heard from
your mother lately,

39:49.520 --> 39:50.669
and here she is.

39:52.990 --> 39:55.117
I-I'm sorry, that was...
that was low.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.650
Don't talk about my mom.

39:56.690 --> 39:57.850
It was just a joke.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.619
Then don't joke.

40:01.230 --> 40:02.822
Clay.

40:04.900 --> 40:07.960
I know it was rough on you
after we split up.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.035
Yeah, you know, and it
would have been a lot rougher

40:09.070 --> 40:10.537
if you stuck around.

40:10.570 --> 40:11.832
You know, it would have
given you more time

40:11.870 --> 40:13.132
to teach me to be like you.

40:13.170 --> 40:15.070
You know, if I was
so terrible,

40:15.110 --> 40:16.975
why is my only son
spending his life

40:17.010 --> 40:18.568
following in my footsteps?

40:18.610 --> 40:21.841
I'm not following
in your footsteps.

40:21.880 --> 40:23.575
I'm erasing them.

40:23.620 --> 40:24.814
You think that being
an absent dad

40:24.850 --> 40:25.885
is because of the Teams?

40:25.920 --> 40:27.182
You were absent because of you.

40:27.220 --> 40:28.983
Would you spare me
the psychobabble?

40:29.020 --> 40:32.080
You spent your whole life
looking in the mirror.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.451
You think that's the kind
of man I want to be?

40:38.970 --> 40:41.029
Clay.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.061
Clay.

40:43.100 --> 40:45.102
Don't do this.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.972
(dog barking in distance)

41:18.040 --> 41:19.564
(dialing)

41:28.310 --> 41:29.971
Hey, it's me.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.214
Uh, it went straight
to voice mail,

41:31.250 --> 41:33.184
so you must be
with a client or something.

41:33.220 --> 41:35.211
Look, I just wanted to tell you
that I-I'm planning on

41:35.260 --> 41:37.979
coming by this weekend
to get Michael

41:38.020 --> 41:39.681
and have a little
man time with him.

41:39.730 --> 41:40.754
You know, a little
father and son--

41:40.790 --> 41:42.291
see what's going on with him.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.561
As far as Nate's burner phone
is concerned,

41:45.600 --> 41:49.297
look, there's no good way
to access the location history,

41:49.340 --> 41:50.898
so that's a dead end.

41:50.940 --> 41:52.965
We'll talk about it
when I see you.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.638
Give those babies
a kiss from me, all right?

42:12.990 --> 42:15.049
(clears throat)

42:20.070 --> 42:21.935
(sighs)

42:26.010 --> 42:27.568
(chuckles)

42:32.750 --> 42:34.672
(chuckles)

42:59.110 --> 43:01.977
What are you doing
in Afghanistan?
