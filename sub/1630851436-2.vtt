00:05.464 --> 00:08.033
-
I'm not complaining, Tom,

00:08.133 --> 00:09.701
but you clearly said,
"Come over.

00:09.801 --> 00:11.103
I'm having a pool party."

00:11.169 --> 00:13.271
- I mean, pool, hose.
Same thing, Right?

00:13.338 --> 00:15.340
- There's no such thing
as a hose party.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.809
I've never heard
of a hose party.

00:17.876 --> 00:19.878
- It's not a great turnout.
I mean, I'll admit that.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.546
- Look, man, I might take off.
It's hard to picture

00:21.647 --> 00:23.215
this party
taking a turn for the better.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.549
- Yeah.

00:24.650 --> 00:26.051
- Take off?
Oh, no, please, no, please.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.219
- What is that?

00:27.319 --> 00:28.186
Do you hear that?

00:28.286 --> 00:29.554
- Uh-oh.
- Ice cream man!

00:29.655 --> 00:31.023
- All right, here we go.
I don't have money.

00:31.123 --> 00:32.858
Can I borrow?
- Sorry, Tom.

00:32.958 --> 00:34.226
With all due respect, man,

00:34.326 --> 00:35.694
I just don't think
you're good for it.

00:35.794 --> 00:36.962
- You don't think
I'm good for the money?

00:37.029 --> 00:38.363
- Yeah.
- Dakota?

00:38.463 --> 00:39.831
- No, my mom would never
let me, she'd flip.

00:39.898 --> 00:41.466
- Please, she's wealthy.
She won't miss it.

00:41.533 --> 00:42.701
- Tom, she doesn't like you
and your quote "ilk,"

00:42.801 --> 00:43.969
and you know that.

00:44.036 --> 00:45.303
- She doesn't like me
and my ilk?

00:45.370 --> 00:46.905
- She thinks I'm
at ballet right now.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.473
- All right, you know what?
I'll hit up my mom.

00:48.540 --> 00:49.675
I'll meet you there.
Tell the guy to wait.

00:49.741 --> 00:50.876
- I make no promises!

00:50.976 --> 00:52.544
- Let's go!
Let's go, baby!

00:52.644 --> 00:54.479
- Mom, real quick, I need
$1.25 for the ice cream man.

00:54.546 --> 00:56.148
Don't ask any questions.
Just give me the purse.

00:56.214 --> 00:57.683
Go, go, go!

00:57.749 --> 00:59.818
- What is this?
A bank robbery in the old west?

00:59.885 --> 01:01.153
"Give me the purse?"

01:01.219 --> 01:02.654
- Mom, please,
this is an emergency.

01:02.721 --> 01:04.423
- Well, I'm sorry,
but we can't afford it.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.725
- We can't afford $1.25?
Everybody can.

01:06.825 --> 01:09.428
- Except for us.
I gotta tell you something.

01:09.528 --> 01:10.829
Come here
and sit on Mommy's lap.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.597
- Sit on Mommy's lap?
- Yeah.

01:12.698 --> 01:13.732
- I knew this wasn't gonna be
easy.

01:13.832 --> 01:14.933
It's never easy.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.902
- Ice cream man.
My favorite person!

01:17.002 --> 01:18.203
I'll take a fudgsicle.

01:18.270 --> 01:19.571
- Oh, oh!
Me, too.

01:19.671 --> 01:21.006
Fudgy fudgy fudgy!
- No, me first, me first!

01:21.073 --> 01:22.674
- Whoa, whoa.
Right out of the gate,

01:22.741 --> 01:26.712
I need you guys to take
the energy down, like, 90%.

01:26.778 --> 01:28.113
- Why?

01:28.213 --> 01:30.382
- All day long with the kids
and the excitement.

01:30.449 --> 01:32.517
I'm ready to blow
my brains out in here.

01:32.584 --> 01:34.119
- What?
Why are you so grouchy?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.455
You've got the dream job.
- Here's the thing, Rambo.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.556
- Rambo?
- What?

01:37.622 --> 01:39.458
- Life is a lot like ice cream.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.594
It starts out sweet,
but then it gets sticky.

01:42.694 --> 01:43.595
- Oh.

01:43.695 --> 01:45.797
-
And then you die.

01:45.897 --> 01:47.299
- Wow.
- This is the worst

01:47.399 --> 01:48.800
ice cream man banter
I've ever heard.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.202
- What did you guys want?

01:50.268 --> 01:51.770
- I'm not even in the mood
for this anymore.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.138
- Was it a fudgsicle?
And what did you want?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.906
-
Okay.

01:54.973 --> 01:56.141
- Is the lap necessary?

01:56.241 --> 01:57.909
- I need to know
if you're familiar

01:57.976 --> 02:00.412
with the phrase
"philandering rat."

02:00.479 --> 02:02.214
- It doesn't come up
too often, no.

02:02.280 --> 02:05.083
- Um, hoo.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.219
I've gotta tell you,

02:07.285 --> 02:09.621
your dad is not
on a business trip to London.

02:09.721 --> 02:11.757
- Okay.
What's he doing?

02:11.823 --> 02:13.959
- He's going to dance clubs.

02:14.059 --> 02:15.660
- Dance clubs.
What?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.395
- With someone named Tina
in Myrtle Beach.

02:17.462 --> 02:18.497
She's a masseuse.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.932
- Oh, that's a lot to take in.

02:20.999 --> 02:22.567
You know, that actually
makes more sense.

02:22.634 --> 02:24.069
I never knew why
they'd fly a plumber

02:24.136 --> 02:25.570
to London for a month.

02:25.637 --> 02:27.572
- I was highly adrenalized
when I made that lie up.

02:27.639 --> 02:29.007
- They wouldn't do it.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.408
- If I'm in London,
and I want a plumber,

02:30.475 --> 02:31.743
I don't want some American guy.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.178
- It's a regional job,
in general.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.646
- It was a terrible lie.

02:34.746 --> 02:35.981
There are not a lot
of international plumbers,

02:36.081 --> 02:37.349
and I panicked.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.617
- So we're poor,
is what you're saying?

02:38.683 --> 02:39.985
- We're kind of poor now,
buddy,

02:40.085 --> 02:41.353
but I'm gonna make you
this promise.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.622
- Okay.
- I promise you

02:43.688 --> 02:46.691
if you work hard, and you
earn that money for yourself,

02:46.792 --> 02:48.760
you can buy
all the ice cream you want.

02:48.827 --> 02:51.196
- What's the--
what's the promise exactly?

02:51.296 --> 02:53.365
You won't interfere
with me earning my own money?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.100
- That is my vow to you.

02:55.934 --> 02:58.470
- If you're serious,
I can sell you the dinosaur

02:58.537 --> 03:01.373
and the machine that makes
fart noises for $1.50.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.708
Just mull it over.
I'll be here if you need me.

03:03.809 --> 03:07.045
- A garage sale?
What is this, the 1950s?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.647
- 1950s?
No, what's going on?

03:08.713 --> 03:10.282
- You tell me, man.
You look pathetic out here.

03:10.348 --> 03:11.550
- Pathetic?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.051
- I can't have my man, Tom,
out here--

03:13.151 --> 03:14.219
- I've got the table,
I've got the sign.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.687
I need to earn money,

03:15.787 --> 03:17.556
or this is going to be
the worst summer ever.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.224
I can't even afford ice cream.
- Man, we gotta do a GoFundMe.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.959
- GoFundMe?
What's that?

03:21.026 --> 03:22.561
- You take some pictures and
write "

03:22.661 --> 03:24.229
I'm too poor
to enjoy my summer."

03:24.329 --> 03:26.398
Then, boom!
Money comes in.

03:26.498 --> 03:27.666
- Just free money?

03:27.732 --> 03:29.134
- Free money!
Give me your phone.

03:29.201 --> 03:30.836
- I don't--
I don't have a phone.

03:30.902 --> 03:32.637
- Come on, Tom!
- Don't act surprised.

03:32.704 --> 03:34.239
- You still don't have a phone?
- I never got one.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.907
- How are you gonna
make it in this world?

03:36.007 --> 03:38.243
- I just run around and play.
- I've got two phones.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.312
One of mine is for checking in
with my parents.

03:40.378 --> 03:41.847
This is for doing weird stuff.

03:41.913 --> 03:43.515
- We're using
the weird one then.

03:43.582 --> 03:45.083
- Yeah, let's take some pics.
Stand by the garbage can.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.418
- Garbage?
No.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.752
- Come on, man!
- All right, how's that?

03:47.853 --> 03:48.920
- Come on,
slouch a little more.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.088
- Slouch?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.256
- When we write
this description,

03:51.356 --> 03:52.757
people gotta feel sad for you.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.259
- All right, how's this?
- Yes, baby, now we talking!

03:54.359 --> 03:55.927
- You like what you're seeing?

03:56.027 --> 03:57.562
- Yeah, I like what I'm seeing.
Hey, get in the trash can.

03:57.662 --> 04:00.498
- Get in the can?
- In the can.

04:00.565 --> 04:01.900
- How's that?
- This is it, baby.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.602
- You like this?
- I love it.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.270
Take that chicken
and smear it on your face.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.439
- This is going to make people
buy ice cream for me?

04:07.539 --> 04:08.607
- Nibble.
I need a nibble.

04:08.707 --> 04:09.674
- Nibble?
No.

04:09.741 --> 04:11.109
- I need you to appear hungry.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.510
- Like I'm hungry?
- Like you're hungry,

04:12.577 --> 04:14.913
but you gotta
save some for later.

04:15.013 --> 04:16.948
- So I'm just--I'm starving,
but I'm just nibbling to--

04:17.048 --> 04:18.183
- Now look up.

04:18.250 --> 04:20.185
Make prayer hands.
There you go.

04:20.252 --> 04:22.921
We finna make some money now.
- Just make me look good.

04:23.021 --> 04:25.624
If my mom sees this, she wants
me to look presentable.

04:26.958 --> 04:28.927
- Tom is sleeping
in a dumpster?

04:29.027 --> 04:31.363
- Eating old chicken
from garbage cans?

04:31.429 --> 04:33.131
- He's working in a coal mine?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.033
I didn't even know
they had those here.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.968
- Oh, listen.
Not on my watch.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.372
- Where's my wallet at?
- Not on my watch.

04:40.438 --> 04:41.907
- A street urchin?

04:41.973 --> 04:44.409
That's the saddest thing
I've ever heard.

04:44.476 --> 04:45.911
- Nelson?

04:45.977 --> 04:47.379
- Yo, what's up, man?

04:47.445 --> 04:48.613
- Nelson, I'm not happy.

04:48.713 --> 04:50.382
- Again?
What's going on?

04:50.448 --> 04:51.883
- What did you write
in the fundraiser?

04:51.950 --> 04:53.318
- Oh, man, just the basics.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.453
You know, lack of funds,
et cetera, et cetera.

04:55.553 --> 04:56.488
- Lack of funds?

04:56.588 --> 04:58.056
Did you maybe say that

04:58.123 --> 04:59.624
I'm an unbathed street urchin

04:59.724 --> 05:01.660
who sleeps in a dumpster
and eats leftover chicken?

05:01.760 --> 05:04.329
- I might have slipped that in
just for effect.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.463
- You might have slipped it in?

05:05.563 --> 05:06.598
- Before you get mad, look.

05:06.665 --> 05:08.066
Take a look at this tally.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.402
- What's this?
- Six Gs!

05:10.468 --> 05:11.836
- Six Gs?
That's too many Gs.

05:11.937 --> 05:14.306
We only asked
for "some ice cream money."

05:14.406 --> 05:15.941
- Yeah, this is
"some ice cream money."

05:16.007 --> 05:17.776
- No, Nelson.
We have to give it back.

05:17.842 --> 05:19.811
I mean, if you go
past the goal, you have to--

05:19.911 --> 05:22.180
- We can't give it back, man.
We could go to jail for fraud.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.682
- You have
to give something back.

05:23.782 --> 05:25.250
You gotta give at least
four Gs back.

05:25.317 --> 05:26.518
- Hey, Dad.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.086
If you make extra money
on a fundraiser,

05:28.153 --> 05:29.955
let's say, for ice cream,
do you get to keep it?

05:30.021 --> 05:31.022
- Of course.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.190
Just spend the money

05:32.290 --> 05:33.858
on "ice cream-related items."

05:33.959 --> 05:35.193
- Ice cream-related items?

05:35.293 --> 05:37.162
- Yeah, you know,
like cones and sprinkles.

05:37.262 --> 05:40.265
Anything that's
ice cream-related.

05:40.332 --> 05:41.800
- That's what I thought.

05:41.866 --> 05:43.702
- Honestly, from what
I've observed in my years,

05:43.802 --> 05:45.036
this sounds like embezzlement.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.705
- Embezzlement?
We kids, man.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.674
That falls under the category
of "summertime hijinks."

05:49.774 --> 05:51.109
- Summertime hijinks.

05:51.176 --> 05:52.610
All right,
that sounds like fun.

05:53.845 --> 05:55.480
- What do you think?

05:55.547 --> 05:57.148
We're going all ice cream or
we're gonna get some pudding?

05:57.215 --> 05:58.216
Or what--what do we--
- Spoons.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.151
- Multiple spoons.

06:00.218 --> 06:01.319
- Hey.
- Multiple cups.

06:01.386 --> 06:02.721
- Hey, hello.
- Napkins.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.189
- Ice cream as far
as the eye can see.

06:04.289 --> 06:05.490
- Hello, hi.

06:05.557 --> 06:06.558
- Hey, buddy.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.159
Are you going to buy anything?

06:08.226 --> 06:10.161
- Tom, he wants to know
if we're gonna buy anything.

06:10.228 --> 06:11.629
- That makes me chuckle.

06:11.696 --> 06:13.398
- What are we not buying?
That's the question.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.867
- Okay, I don't know
what's going on here,

06:15.967 --> 06:18.036
but I've got a line
of customers behind you, so--

06:18.136 --> 06:20.572
- You call those customers?

06:20.672 --> 06:21.840
What you got?
Skittles?

06:21.906 --> 06:23.208
That's it?

06:23.308 --> 06:25.343
We real customers.
Those are small potatoes.

06:25.410 --> 06:28.013
- Let's start with $6,000
worth of Klondike bars.

06:28.079 --> 06:29.481
- Wrap them up.

06:29.547 --> 06:32.684
- We don't keep that many
Klondike bars in stock.

06:32.751 --> 06:35.420
If you buy that whole shelf,
it's $40.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.489
- Call someone.
- Call Klondike?

06:37.555 --> 06:38.923
- What, you scared?

06:39.024 --> 06:40.525
Give me Klondike's number.
I'll call them.

06:40.592 --> 06:42.761
- I'm not scared
to call Klondike.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.062
- This guy's scared to call.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.563
- This is such
a weird challenge

06:45.663 --> 06:46.998
from two children.

06:47.065 --> 06:48.566
- What part of six Gs
do you not understand?

06:48.666 --> 06:49.868
- I'm a cashier.

06:49.934 --> 06:51.436
It doesn't matter
how much money you have.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.937
- Wait, whoa, whoa.
So you don't own the place?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.606
- You don't own 7-Eleven?
- No!

06:54.706 --> 06:57.575
Do I look like
an owner of anything?

06:57.675 --> 06:58.710
- I don't think
we've got a deal.

06:58.777 --> 07:00.278
I think we're at an impasse.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.746
- Man, they don't make cashiers
like they used to.

07:02.514 --> 07:06.117
- Okay, so remember, Tom,
no matter how tough things get,

07:06.217 --> 07:08.286
we always make time for church.
- Do we?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.754
We've literally
never done this.

07:09.854 --> 07:11.122
- Since your dad
took off with the floozy,

07:11.222 --> 07:12.624
this is our PR move.
- Oh.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.526
- Single mom with her son.
It's a classic.

07:14.592 --> 07:18.296
- But we sing the songs
and say the prayers or we--

07:18.396 --> 07:20.865
- When it's written
in the book, you sing it.

07:20.932 --> 07:22.434
If you don't know it,

07:22.534 --> 07:24.769
♪ Ah, na, na, na, na, na ♪

07:24.869 --> 07:26.638
- Oh, okay.
It's just for show.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.039
- Mm-hmm, yep.
- We're mouthing it.

07:28.106 --> 07:30.542
- Hi, Tom.
I wanted to give you this.

07:30.608 --> 07:34.112
I just found out
that you're a street urchin.

07:34.212 --> 07:36.781
- Oh, thank you, Yasmine.
That's very, uh, very kind.

07:36.881 --> 07:38.283
- What was that all about?

07:38.383 --> 07:39.651
- Uh, I'm in a school play.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.052
I'm playing the street urchin.

07:41.119 --> 07:42.720
- Oh.
Would have been nice to know.

07:42.787 --> 07:44.622
- Good morning, congregation.

07:44.722 --> 07:46.558
Good morning, friends.

07:46.624 --> 07:49.327
Today we're going
to talk about compassion.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.097
We have some new members here,
and we want them

07:52.163 --> 07:54.165
to know that no one
looks down on them

07:54.265 --> 07:57.001
because they sleep
in a filthy dumpster.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.404
As we know from the Bible

07:59.471 --> 08:00.839
in the book of Thomas,

08:00.939 --> 08:03.508
God loves all types
of families.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.610
Single mothers with one child.

08:05.677 --> 08:08.113
- Is he talking about us?
- No, I can't imagine.

08:08.179 --> 08:09.647
- He looks down on them
and blesses them

08:09.747 --> 08:12.083
while they nibble
on an old chicken bone

08:12.150 --> 08:14.085
that they found
on the side of the street.

08:14.152 --> 08:15.520
- Is he pointing at us?

08:15.620 --> 08:16.521
- Us?
No.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.156
- God loves this family.

08:18.256 --> 08:20.492
God hopes
that they suck the marrow

08:20.592 --> 08:21.793
from that old chicken bone.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.495
- Tom,
what did you tell people?

08:23.595 --> 08:25.530
- He's just making stuff up.
You know, I gotta get going.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.532
I gotta use the bathroom.
I'm gonna run home real quick.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.633
- Right now?

08:28.700 --> 08:30.101
- I'm not comfortable urinating

08:30.168 --> 08:32.036
with the Lord watching.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.472
- What?
No, Tom, you're not leaving.

08:34.539 --> 08:35.773
- All right,
I'll use the church bathroom.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.142
If I don't come back at all,

08:37.208 --> 08:38.309
just don't even worry about it.

08:38.376 --> 08:39.844
- What?
Tom, Tom!

08:43.481 --> 08:45.183
- Listen, we need
to unload the money now.

08:45.283 --> 08:46.551
- Tom.
- Right now.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.719
My mom's going to find out
what we did.

08:47.819 --> 08:48.720
She's onto it.

08:48.820 --> 08:49.888
- Tom, listen to yourself.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.823
Breathe.
Who's in charge here?

08:51.890 --> 08:53.158
- Who's in charge?
Me.

08:53.224 --> 08:54.492
I'm wearing a suit.
I'm the boss.

08:54.559 --> 08:55.560
- Don't pull
the suit card on me.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.561
- I'm just saying.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.829
- There's no dress code

08:57.896 --> 08:59.063
in corporate America
these days.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.798
- Listen,
in the next half hour,

09:00.865 --> 09:02.467
I want the money off the books,
like we never had it.

09:02.534 --> 09:04.836
- That's it!

09:04.903 --> 09:07.739
The ultimate
ice cream-related item.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.073
- I'm not following.
What do you want to buy?

09:09.174 --> 09:10.575
You want
to buy some fudgsicles?

09:10.675 --> 09:13.244
- Brother,
we buying the whole truck.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.046
- Oh.
- Look at her.

09:15.146 --> 09:18.183
- That is the ultimate ice
cream-related item, isn't it?

09:18.249 --> 09:19.517
- Ah, great.

09:19.584 --> 09:21.319
More kids looking
for a sugar high.

09:21.386 --> 09:23.087
- We have a proposal.
You sitting down?

09:23.188 --> 09:25.023
- Do I look like--I'm
standing in the fucking truck.

09:25.089 --> 09:26.724
I'm not sitting down.
What's your proposal?

09:26.824 --> 09:28.426
- In general,
we've got some funds

09:28.526 --> 09:29.694
that we need
to get off the books.

09:29.761 --> 09:31.996
- We got six grand.
- Hmm.

09:32.063 --> 09:34.265
- You clearly hate this job

09:34.365 --> 09:35.433
and are very disgruntled.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.701
- Ah.
Very perceptive.

09:36.768 --> 09:38.603
- The truck that is now yours,

09:38.703 --> 09:39.771
would become ours.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.106
I know you're thinking--
- Done.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.708
- Done?
Wow.

09:43.775 --> 09:44.943
That was a little easier
than I thought.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.911
- Done!
Anything to get out.

09:47.011 --> 09:49.747
I'll sell it to little kids.
I don't give a fuck.

09:49.847 --> 09:50.949
- I mean, you still
gotta drive it though.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.116
We don't have any licenses yet.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.384
- I love it.
It's a deal.

09:53.451 --> 09:55.220
- This is great.
- Yeah, whoo-hoo!

09:55.286 --> 09:56.788
- Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

09:56.888 --> 09:58.590
I'll go call Geico
and write up the bill of sale.

09:58.690 --> 10:00.391
- Nice.
- You stay here with the truck.

10:00.458 --> 10:01.793
Can I leave you
in charge for a minute?

10:01.893 --> 10:03.094
- I'll leave myself in charge.

10:03.194 --> 10:04.562
I'm kind of the boss, but sure.

10:04.629 --> 10:07.465
- Okay, if that makes you
feel, uh, good.

10:08.266 --> 10:11.302
- The best two days of an
ice cream truck owner's life?

10:11.402 --> 10:13.638
The day you buy it
and the day you sell it.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.073
- Uh, excuse me.

10:15.139 --> 10:18.076
Hi, we've been waiting
for 10 minutes, I'd say.

10:18.142 --> 10:20.812
- Listen, toots.
I'm on a smoke break.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.314
- Did you just call me toots?
I want to speak to the manager.

10:23.414 --> 10:24.816
Who do I call?
- He's right here.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.385
- Shh, shh, shh!
- The manager's in the truck?

10:27.452 --> 10:28.653
- No.
- The manager and owner.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.421
- Shut up!
- Tom, stop hiding.

10:30.488 --> 10:31.723
- Tom?

10:31.789 --> 10:33.057
- These ladies want
to file a complaint.

10:33.124 --> 10:34.292
- Tom!
Tom, is that you?

10:34.392 --> 10:35.460
- Oh, hey!
Yeah, I'm in here.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.828
- I thought you had no money.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.429
Now your family owns
an ice cream truck?

10:38.496 --> 10:39.931
- Drive, drive, drive!
Drive or you're fired.

10:39.998 --> 10:41.799
- All right, here we go.

10:41.899 --> 10:43.268
- Bye, Tom.

10:44.502 --> 10:46.170
- Oh, my God.
This is not good.

10:46.271 --> 10:47.305
All right, let me think.

10:47.405 --> 10:48.506
Think, Tom.
Think, boss.

10:48.606 --> 10:49.774
What would Nelson do?

10:49.841 --> 10:51.109
What would Nelson do?

10:51.175 --> 10:52.510
You know what?
Here it is.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.178
If there's no truck,
I can deny it all.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.180
Executive decision,
we gotta sink it.

10:56.281 --> 10:59.584
- You sure about that?
- I see literally no options.

10:59.651 --> 11:01.653
We need to submerge the truck
in the river.

11:01.753 --> 11:03.154
What do you think?
You like that idea?

11:03.254 --> 11:04.922
- Whatever you want, man.
It's your show.

11:04.989 --> 11:06.591
- So it's a good idea?
- I love it.

11:06.658 --> 11:08.660
- All right, I feel
like it's a unanimous decision.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.194
- Two to zero.

11:10.295 --> 11:11.863
- Nelson's not here.
All right, we got the votes.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.198
<i>♪ ♪</i>

11:14.299 --> 11:16.668
- Oh, beloved truck,

11:16.768 --> 11:18.469
thank you for the good times

11:18.536 --> 11:21.706
you've given to the children
over many summers,

11:21.806 --> 11:24.542
of yesteryear and days of yore.

11:24.642 --> 11:27.045
You have caused much,
much happiness--

11:27.145 --> 11:30.214
- But also much sorrow
and pain.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.050
- You've also caused
much sorrow and pain

11:32.150 --> 11:34.118
for many people.
- Great pain.

11:34.185 --> 11:35.820
- You've really ruined
many lives.

11:35.887 --> 11:37.288
- Soul-searing pain.

11:37.355 --> 11:39.891
- And on that note,
we bid you farewell.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.225
- Preach.

11:44.962 --> 11:46.698
-
Wow.

11:46.798 --> 11:49.467
- You're officially a man now.
- Thank you.

11:49.534 --> 11:51.469
- You sank
your first ice cream truck.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.171
- Tom!
What the hell are you doing?

11:53.237 --> 11:54.572
- What am I doing?
We sank the truck.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.474
- I left you in charge
for one hour.

11:56.541 --> 11:58.142
- Listen, we had no choice.
- No choice.

11:58.209 --> 12:00.578
- No options whatsoever.
My mom was going to find out.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.214
I pulled the trigger.
I said we gotta sink it.

12:03.314 --> 12:04.916
- We could've just
signed over the title.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.250
You know,
written up a bill of sale.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.652
- Oh.
- I didn't think of that.

12:07.719 --> 12:09.153
- We could have just
hid the truck

12:09.220 --> 12:11.055
for a few months
and filed an insurance claim.

12:11.155 --> 12:13.391
- Those are all good ideas.
- So many options.

12:13.491 --> 12:15.827
- Ah, man, maybe I'm not
leadership material after all.

12:15.893 --> 12:17.161
This is, uh--
- You think?

12:17.228 --> 12:19.063
- Not a good debut.
- Okay, dudes.

12:19.163 --> 12:22.834
You owe me $5,000 for the
truck, $800 for inventory,

12:22.900 --> 12:25.903
and $200
for miscellaneous expenses.

12:26.003 --> 12:27.271
- All right, pay the man.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.107
- Um, about that.

12:29.207 --> 12:31.042
The GoFundMe
is in my dad's account.

12:31.109 --> 12:33.778
I just knew the password.
- Come again?

12:33.878 --> 12:37.081
- I have no way
to get you the actual funds.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.751
All right,
this is the last time

12:39.851 --> 12:42.286
I go into business
with two 10-year-olds.

12:42.387 --> 12:44.455

you did it in the first place.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.591
- It was surprising
how quickly he agreed.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.593
- When he said,
"Done," I was like, "Oh.

12:48.693 --> 12:49.961
Oh, we're really doing this."

12:50.061 --> 12:52.230
