00:11.636 --> 00:12.095
-"Previously on
"Notorious Queens"...

00:12.096 --> 00:14.596
-And stay! Yeah! Ah!

00:14.597 --> 00:16.306
-I'm trying to focus, you know,

00:16.307 --> 00:17.850
but I just feel like
there's so many things

00:17.851 --> 00:19.143
pulling my focus right now

00:19.144 --> 00:22.563
because, like, I'm trying
to find a place to live.

00:22.564 --> 00:23.939
-It doesn't look like you

00:23.940 --> 00:27.151
about to be ready for
a listening party in three days.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.569
-This is my book.
It's my life.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.070
- And it's your story, yeah.
- And my story.

00:30.071 --> 00:32.614
But I have to discuss
these things with them.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.324
Plus, they're part of my story.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.744
My biggest fears
about writing this book

00:36.745 --> 00:39.955
is how my family
are gonna look at me.

00:39.956 --> 00:41.498
-Have you even mentioned it
to any of them?

00:41.499 --> 00:43.917
-No, I'm really nervous
about it,

00:43.918 --> 00:45.627
just sucked the air out of me.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.338
- Hi, Jasmine.
- How are you ladies?

00:48.339 --> 00:49.715
- Good. How are you?
- How are you?

00:49.716 --> 00:52.801
I introduced Mehgan
to the matchmaker.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.804
I know that you're gonna
be able to help her love life

00:55.805 --> 00:58.015
and find her
the man of her dreams.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.850
- Period, 'cause I got a list.
- I can't wait to see it.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.226
-I'm a little terrified,

01:01.227 --> 01:03.395
but I'm sure
we'll figure it out.

01:03.396 --> 01:05.272
-With Tonesa, there was
a social-media post,

01:05.273 --> 01:08.776
and I just felt like a post or
comment was kind of subbing me.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.235
-Have you guys had
that conversation?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.695
- We haven't.
- Okay.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.906
-I know you and Toni
have a relationship.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.741
I just felt like
I had caught a beat.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.117
-She's pretty direct.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.912
If she felt like that about you,
she'll let you know.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.497
- Yeah.
- She said that y'all had, like,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.832
a little Internet beef.
- Me and Stormey did?

01:23.833 --> 01:26.293
-Mm-hmm.
So did y'all get to talk yet?

01:26.294 --> 01:28.504
Did y'all hash out y'all's...

01:28.505 --> 01:30.547
- No.
- Hash out what?

01:30.548 --> 01:32.800
-No, I had mentioned to Mehgan,

01:32.801 --> 01:34.343
and I also mentioned it
to La'Britney --

01:34.344 --> 01:35.719
I felt like the post
was subbing.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.346
It wasn't that big of a deal.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.556
-But you remembered it
enough to tell them.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.974
-I just met Mehgan, and she --

01:40.975 --> 01:43.310
-And she coming to me
and telling me what's going on.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.645
-Well, that's why
I'm telling you now.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.063
And she didn't
have to bust it out.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.856
I was gonna address it anyway,

01:47.857 --> 01:49.608
'cause I don't need nobody
to speak for me.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.235
-If y'all have something
y'all need to hash out,

01:51.236 --> 01:52.611
it just needs to be hashed out.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.071
-Well, maybe I didn't
fucking feel like it.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.447
-Well, maybe you wasn't gonna
tell her at all.

01:55.448 --> 01:56.990
-Maybe I didn't
fucking feel like it.

01:56.991 --> 02:00.452
Ain't nobody gonna make me
do a motherfucking thing.

- Girl, let me tell you.

02:47.041 --> 02:49.793
So you know Toni set up
a meeting with Mehgan and I.

02:49.794 --> 02:50.878
-How'd that go?

02:50.879 --> 02:52.462
-It actually went better
than expected.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.964
- Okay.
- You know, she and I --

02:53.965 --> 02:55.465
We actually really needed
to sit down

02:55.466 --> 02:56.842
and have a conversation
as women.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.094
I apologize if I was
overly aggressive,

02:59.095 --> 03:00.304
You know what I mean?

03:00.305 --> 03:02.514
I know that I have
a tendency to blow up,

03:02.515 --> 03:04.266
and I am trying to, you know,
work on that.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.602
-But I am glad that we did
get to talk about it...

03:06.603 --> 03:08.353
- Me, too.
- 'cause I'd hate to feel

03:08.354 --> 03:09.438
uncomfortable.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.607
-You know, we actually
reconciled.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.692
-Really? You apologized?

03:13.693 --> 03:15.152
-Yes, I did apologize.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.280
Mehgan wanted to, you know,
put whatever we had behind us,

03:18.281 --> 03:20.407
and I wanted you to, too,
you know what I mean?

03:20.408 --> 03:24.161
I don't feel like I should have
had to apologize to Mehgan.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.495
I didn't do nothing wrong
to that girl.

03:25.496 --> 03:26.955
That girl was messy
from the gate.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.082
But you know what?
I can reconcile with anyone

03:29.083 --> 03:31.251
but the devil,
and she ain't the devil.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.922
And we can put it behind us,
and we can move on.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.757
-I feel like she was just
a little messy

03:36.758 --> 03:38.258
with that situation.
- You know what?

03:38.259 --> 03:41.011
-You know, like, we had
the same conversation,

03:41.012 --> 03:44.723
and I didn't find it necessary
to run back and, like, you know,

03:44.724 --> 03:47.059
cause any drama
between you and Toni.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.561
-And that's why I was
so upset with her.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.687
-Yeah.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.606
If it was me, I probably
wouldn't have apologized.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.734
I would have been expecting
Mehgan to apologize to me.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.320
I think you just got to
watch Mehgan.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.780
You just got to be careful
with her

03:59.781 --> 04:02.908
because you don't really seem,
like, trustworthy.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.160
-Well, enough about me, girl.
What's been up with you?

04:05.161 --> 04:06.828
You got so much
going on as well.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.122
-I know, girl.
I finally found a crib.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.166
- Good.
- I'm so relieved and happy.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.210
You know, little Russell
just got out here.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.796
I'm ready to just get
settled in, get comfortable.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.840
You feeling me? Like...

04:18.841 --> 04:23.345
The fact that I finally have
found a place to live

04:23.346 --> 04:25.973
here in Los Angeles, California.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.475
I feel like I could conquer
the world right now,

04:28.476 --> 04:29.726
I ain't even gonna lie.

04:29.727 --> 04:31.228
My listening party is coming up.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.023
Like, everything just, like,
happened all in perfect timing.

04:35.024 --> 04:38.443
Not a lot of times
do I pat my own self on my back.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.570
But...

04:40.571 --> 04:43.156
I just been feeling, you know,
just, like, all over the place,

04:43.157 --> 04:45.075
trying to prepare
for the listening party.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.702
-I was just about to
ask you about that.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.746
-Everybody's pretty excited,
but like, anxious, too,

04:49.747 --> 04:52.416
to see what the response
and feedback is gonna be

04:52.417 --> 04:54.167
with the new music, you know?

04:54.168 --> 04:55.627
Everything's just been
having me, like,

04:55.628 --> 04:58.505
stressed out, you know?
- You need a release.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.924
-Girl, I need to do
something fun.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.719
Everything is closed.
We can't go to no clubs.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.429
We can barely get a reservation
at a restaurant.

05:05.430 --> 05:09.266
- Shit is whack right now.
- COVID got it so dead out here.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.601
- Yeah.
- But my choreographer did

05:11.602 --> 05:15.147
tell me about this girl who does
pole-dancing classes,

05:15.148 --> 05:16.398
private ones.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.734
- Pole dancing, thought?
- Pole dancing, yeah.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.818
It'll be fun!

05:19.819 --> 05:21.528
-But more like a fitness side,
right?

05:21.529 --> 05:22.988
-I mean, fitness, sexy,
whatever.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.533
You know, just tap into
our inner Catwoman.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.994
-Uh-oh, see? [Laughs]

05:28.995 --> 05:30.996
You bringing it out.
Well, you know what?

05:30.997 --> 05:32.748
We could do it at the house
if you want.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.542
-Okay, I'ma call Toni and Mehgan
and see if they down.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.252
- Okay, I think it'll be fun.
- You cool with that?

05:37.253 --> 05:39.671
I think so, too.
- Yeah.

- You did?

06:12.914 --> 06:16.750
-Yeah. It was cool.
We did end up having fun...

06:16.751 --> 06:19.169
without you, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.713
- You know?
- I know you the turn-up queen.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.216
-Period. You gonna have fun
wherever you go.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.176
-I like hanging out with Mehgan.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.677
She has so much energy,

06:27.678 --> 06:29.971
and I need somebody younger
I can keep up with.

06:29.972 --> 06:32.432
You know, they keep me going,
gonna keep me poppin'.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.769
-Well, you know, me and Stormey
little conversation

06:35.770 --> 06:37.187
was real little.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.023
We had some coffee
and, you know, every--

06:40.024 --> 06:42.984
We squashed it.
- Yeah, she went in.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.111
-She went in.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.946
-Do you know what
fucking beef is?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.489
You know what I mean?
- Look, I'm like 10 years

06:47.490 --> 06:49.658
younger than y'all.
When somebody say, "We beef" --

06:49.659 --> 06:51.576
-So when you say "beef,"
that shit is real.

06:51.577 --> 06:54.871
-But, you know, I don't --
I don't disrespect my elders.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.165
You know, I was raised
better than that...

06:57.166 --> 06:59.334
- Okay.
- Period.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.211
Stormey and I are
in a decent place.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.047
Like, we're good.
I'm mostly past it.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.091
But I feel like Stormey's
just kind of weird.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.010
Like, Stormey was more mad at me
than she was at Toni,

07:09.011 --> 07:11.221
which is crazy
because her problem with Toni

07:11.222 --> 07:14.015
was the source
of where all this came from.

07:14.016 --> 07:16.017
What was the conversation?
What was the post?

07:16.018 --> 07:18.687
You got to fill me in
on y'all conversation.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.356
-It was just, you know,
we talked -- the post --

07:21.357 --> 07:23.400
I still don't understand
the post.

07:23.401 --> 07:24.985
It wasn't for her.
- Mm-hmm.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.737
-I don't even know what she was
in her feelings about that.

07:27.738 --> 07:31.283
- So y'all good?
- We're good, you know? We cool.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.203
-I was really surprised that
I'm the one that told you

07:35.204 --> 07:36.872
and La'Britney didn't.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.833
-Yeah. Why -- Why did you
have to tell me?

07:39.834 --> 07:41.501
We just met.
- Mm-hmm.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.879
-I know her.
Why didn't she say it?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.255
- Mm-hmm.
- You know?

07:45.256 --> 07:46.715
-I talked to La'Britney
a couple days ago.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.425
I said, "La'Britney,
I want to tell Toni this.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.010
This has been on my heart."
'Cause I did have

07:50.011 --> 07:51.553
some reservations
about bringing it up.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.889
-I didn't even realize
La'Britney even knew.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.600
Now I'm seeing there's a lot
of little shade

07:56.601 --> 07:58.059
happening in our group.

07:58.060 --> 08:02.606
We come from the same town,
same clique, same circle.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.191
- Mm-hmm.
- So why?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.400
-According to Toni, like,

08:05.401 --> 08:06.902
La'Britney and Toni are
really close.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.862
They knew each other for years
and years and years.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.406
So I would have thought
that La'Britney would have said

08:11.407 --> 08:12.908
something to Toni

08:12.909 --> 08:15.076
about Stormey's problem with her
before I did.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.953
But La'Britney seems like
a person

08:16.954 --> 08:18.163
that's all about herself.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.707
So I think she just
doesn't care about Toni.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.210
If I was La'Britney, like,
my loyalty would lie

08:23.211 --> 08:25.462
with my -- the person I've known
the longest in my friends.

08:25.463 --> 08:27.172
- Right!
- So it's just like,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.423
I don't know.
- I do.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.925
I need to know,
what was she thinking?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.927
Why she didn't say shit?
Where were you at?

08:31.928 --> 08:35.805
What side you on?
- Is she playing both sides?

08:35.806 --> 08:38.433
-This conversation with Mehgan

08:38.434 --> 08:41.978
has made me view La'Britney
in a different light.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.649
I'm usually the one
that pop off right away,

08:45.650 --> 08:51.112
but I've been taking a new view
at the way I handle things.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.449
So I might have to, you know,
sit on this for a minute,

08:54.450 --> 08:57.702
marinate on it, and see how
I'm gonna react to it.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.872
I'm just gonna have to
keep my eye out on La'Britney,

09:00.873 --> 09:03.708
'cause we already had a
conversation about some bullshit

09:03.709 --> 09:05.210
that went on in Detroit.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.296
I pulled up to pick up my man...
- Uh-huh.

09:08.297 --> 09:10.674
- And your titties
was hanging out,

09:10.675 --> 09:12.008
and I know you.
- Yeah.

09:12.009 --> 09:14.219
-And so I'm like, "Well,
she know that's my nigga."

09:14.220 --> 09:16.972
-Oh, no, but it was never about
your nigga.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.808
-You know, we tried to --
We cleared that up.

09:19.809 --> 09:20.934
I hope we cleared it up.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.519
But I'm still gonna
watch your ass.

09:22.520 --> 09:26.565
-La'Britney is a very, like,
hard, like, anti-bullshit,

09:26.566 --> 09:29.442
like, no fun,
like, I ain't playing with you

09:29.443 --> 09:31.194
type of attitude type of girl.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.696
And Miss T is
kind of the same way.

09:32.697 --> 09:34.781
So I think the conversation
with La'Britney and Toni,

09:34.782 --> 09:38.702
when it eventually does happen,
is gonna be really spicy.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.121
- So what else has been up?
- Girl, so La'Britney took it

09:41.122 --> 09:43.748
upon herself to set me up
with a matchmaker girl.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.751
- Oh!
- And I gave her my list.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.170
We just -- we just gonna see
what she come up with.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.714
- Oh, okay.
- I might like the man.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.966
-Did La'Britney use them also?

09:52.967 --> 09:55.218
-No, La'Britney -- one of
La'Britney's friends use her.

09:55.219 --> 09:57.095
She said that her friend's,
like, happily married.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.430
But like...
- Oh, really?

09:58.431 --> 10:00.223
-Yeah, but like, you know,
I got standards.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.767
I'm not budging.
Like, I'ma continue to decline

10:02.768 --> 10:05.520
until I get what I want,
and that's all, period.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.690
-Okay. Don't keep declining
and you'll be 50.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.483
- Then I'm just gonna be 50.
- No!

10:10.484 --> 10:13.069
-Me and my little box
of vibrators.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.655
-Mehgan in her head.
Really?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.782
She thinks she can find
the perfect man,

10:17.783 --> 10:19.326
but she's sadly mistaken.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.786
You know, I don't think there's
a perfect person out there.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.998
I used to be, you know,
unrealistic also.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.500
But now I'm just like,
I want, you know,

10:27.501 --> 10:30.545
somebody that genuinely loves me
and cares about me.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.589
You know, I don't want 'em
butt ugly, though.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.801
La'Britney -- she is giving
a pole-dancing party

10:36.802 --> 10:38.011
at Stormey's.

10:38.012 --> 10:41.473
-I want to have
a pole-dancing class

10:41.474 --> 10:44.309
for us and all the girls
at Stormey house

10:44.310 --> 10:46.853
to just, like, have some fun

10:46.854 --> 10:49.105
and release some anxiety,
you know?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.815
- Okay, I'm down.
- Okay.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.442
- Did you call Mehgan?
- No, if you talk to her,

10:52.443 --> 10:56.029
let her know 'cause I'd love
for her to come through.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.697
-Okay. I'll let her know.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.492
We're gonna go try and,
you know, have a good time.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.577
-Yeah, I'm down.
I miss hanging out.

11:02.578 --> 11:03.912
- Yeah.
- We gonna see what

11:03.913 --> 11:06.581
you gonna do, Miss T,
since you the realist.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.751
We gonna see.
- Yeah, you'll see.

- What you doing?
- I'm doing schoolwork.

11:34.485 --> 11:36.653
Typing right now.

11:53.170 --> 11:56.506
-It feels so good to be
in my own crib

11:56.507 --> 11:57.882
with little Russell here.

11:57.883 --> 12:02.887
I was actually able to find
a house with everything

12:02.888 --> 12:04.264
that I was looking for.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.517
There's enough space.
It's in a great location.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.810
It's the double-O vibe.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.271
L.A. is starting to feel
more and more like home.

12:11.272 --> 12:15.108
I'm so happy that
you have finally made it here.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.735
I hate that your brother
couldn't come.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.738
You know, he had to take care
of his business at home, though.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.239
- Yeah.
- But he'll be out here soon.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.824
- Yeah.
- So, I mean, how do you feel

12:22.825 --> 12:24.033
about Los Angeles?

12:24.034 --> 12:26.911
Russ -- Rusty Russ in L.A.
How do you feel?

12:26.912 --> 12:30.081
-Like, I'm just excited
to be out here for long-term.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.877
-Yeah, I'm excited to see you
meet some new friends out here.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.004
-Yeah. I'm excited to go to,
like, school

12:36.005 --> 12:38.423
and meet new people,
and so it'll be cool.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.635
-I know. It's just so weird now
with, like, COVID going on

12:42.636 --> 12:46.556
and you not being able
to go to an actual school

12:46.557 --> 12:48.433
and everything being online.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.353
But it's a really social type
of community out here.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.190
So I think you making friends --
It won't be hard.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.525
Plus, you've got such an amazing
personality.

12:57.526 --> 12:59.027
Like, people are gonna
love you anyway.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.154
And you my son.
- Um...

13:01.155 --> 13:04.741
-[Laughs] You got me twisted.
I like this haircut.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.495
-Thank you. I walked over
to the Americana the other day

13:08.496 --> 13:09.871
and I went shopping and stuff

13:09.872 --> 13:12.874
and I got some clothes and stuff
and went out to eat.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.209
-You cashed out?

13:14.210 --> 13:18.254
-I spent -- I spent like --
I think I spent like $300.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.590
-You ballin'!
What'd you buy me?

13:20.591 --> 13:22.175
-[Laughs] Nothing.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.886
- You just spent my money.
- Yeah, I did.

13:24.887 --> 13:27.722
I spent all the money
you gave me.

13:27.723 --> 13:30.642
-So how do you like
the new crib?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.894
You know,
it took me a long time.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.021
-Yeah, it did.
It took you forever.

13:35.022 --> 13:37.273
-I know, because I just wanted
it to be right,

13:37.274 --> 13:41.027
but I took my time
and found us something spacious,

13:41.028 --> 13:42.278
nice, you know what I'm saying,

13:42.279 --> 13:43.863
like, so we can
really be comfortable

13:43.864 --> 13:45.698
and do what we got to do
out here.

13:45.699 --> 13:48.159
- Yeah.
- So I have a listening party

13:48.160 --> 13:51.037
for "Ducked Off"
in a couple of days,

13:51.038 --> 13:53.248
and I definitely want you
to be there.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.415
-Yeah.

13:54.416 --> 13:55.750
-What do you think
about "Ducked Off"?

13:55.751 --> 13:57.210
You have a really good ear
for music.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.795
You tell me what you think

13:58.796 --> 13:59.921
-I really like the song.

13:59.922 --> 14:01.381
It's probably my favorite one
of yours.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.757
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.050
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's definitely

14:04.051 --> 14:05.927
one of my favorites.
- That mean a lot.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.720
- [Laughs]
- For real.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.055
And now that you here, I can

14:09.056 --> 14:12.100
put my mind to ease
a little bit, you know?

14:12.101 --> 14:15.311
Well, now I got my crib,
now that my son is out here,

14:15.312 --> 14:17.605
now I can really focus
on this listening party.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.065
There's a lot at stake here.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.484
It's the first time I'm having
a listening party in L.A.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.695
first time
I'm performing my new music,

14:23.696 --> 14:26.114
you know, so I really need this
to go well.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.199
I need to be able
to open new doors for me

14:28.200 --> 14:32.245
to be able to make more money
so I can provide for my family.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.163
You good.
You gonna get it together.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.083
Make sure you finish
that science work.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.501
-I've been doing it.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.461
-Get to it, buddy.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.505
- I will.
- Mm-hmm.

-It's gonna be
a hot one this week.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.314
- Yes, girl.
- I heard you talked to Mehgan.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.566
-I heard you guys
squashed your beef.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.110
-We did.
So, yes, I felt like it was just

15:04.111 --> 15:05.987
petty enough where we could
just put this behind us.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.866
And I'm glad that we were able
to squash our little issue.

15:09.867 --> 15:11.868
So, girl, I know you writing
this book.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.120
How's that going?
- It's going good.

15:14.121 --> 15:17.040
You know, actually,
the more I write,

15:17.041 --> 15:19.334
things are just
pouring out, you know,

15:19.335 --> 15:20.793
it's just like a rain fall.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.254
It just be coming, coming,
coming, and I'm like, "Damn."

15:23.255 --> 15:24.797
I start thinking about stuff.
I'm like,

15:24.798 --> 15:26.799
"Ooh, I need to put that here
and put that here."

15:26.800 --> 15:28.259
So, yeah,
I be going through that.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.470
You know, I have to
go backwards and stuff like that

15:30.471 --> 15:33.181
because I had these moments
that I forgot about.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.724
-So it's like going through
memory lane.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.100
- Right. Right.
- Mm-hmm.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.478
-'Cause I do -- I've --
I've forgotten a lot

15:38.479 --> 15:41.689
until I start writing.
I was like, "Oh, shoot.

15:41.690 --> 15:44.150
I really did that," you know?

15:44.151 --> 15:45.902
-I know exactly what
you mean by that.

15:45.903 --> 15:51.532
-I still have not told Terry
or my boys about my book.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.534
-Have you talked to your sons
about it?

15:53.535 --> 15:55.036
-No, I haven't.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.955
-Do you think the reason why
you haven't talked to them

15:56.956 --> 15:59.374
because you're afraid they're
gonna give you pushback?

15:59.375 --> 16:02.835
-[Exhales] I've been holding off
on telling them.

16:02.836 --> 16:04.587
-Yeah, but, sis,

16:04.588 --> 16:07.131
that conversation
needs to happen.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.258
-You right. I'm glad
I talked to you about it.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.135
And I have a lot to think about.

16:11.136 --> 16:13.763
I've always
put other people first,

16:13.764 --> 16:15.556
but this book is about me.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.559
So now it's my turn
to put myself first.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.062
I wanted to read the story
to you and the girls.

16:21.063 --> 16:24.565
I wanted to know if I can invite
the girls over to your house...

16:24.566 --> 16:25.733
-Oh, of course.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.026
- Read a couple of chapters
to you.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.528
-I think that would be
wonderful.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.154
I'm actually honored that
you want to share, you know,

16:30.155 --> 16:31.614
what you've written already,
so yes.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.492
-I am, too.
It's really important to me

16:34.493 --> 16:37.245
that I get y'all feedback.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.872
I want to read some of the pages
to my girls

16:39.873 --> 16:42.250
'cause they don't know
certain parts of me.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.544
You know, they just know,
oh, the surface Toni

16:44.545 --> 16:47.005
or what they heard
in the streets.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.090
I've never really, you know,

16:49.091 --> 16:51.217
opened myself
completely up to them.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.012
So now I have to be
very vulnerable.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.304
I have to just, you know,

16:55.305 --> 16:58.099
just give it to them
just like, "This is me.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.101
This is who I -- who I was."

17:00.102 --> 17:04.105
And I'm just nervous about
how they might feel.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.481
- Well, yes!
- I'm excited.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.899
- I'm excited, too.
- Yeah.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.235
-I look forward.
Definitely look forward to it.

17:09.236 --> 17:13.031
-So are we about to have this
pole-dancing thing going on?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.034
-Yes. So La'Britney came through
with some fun

17:16.035 --> 17:17.577
because, girl...
- You need that.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.579
- I need that. I feel like
we all need that, though.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.497
And it's a good bonding
for all of us.

17:21.498 --> 17:22.999
-Yeah, it's gonna be fun.

17:23.000 --> 17:26.669
-La'Britney set up this
pole-dancing party this week.

17:26.670 --> 17:28.171
It's supposed to be fun,

17:28.172 --> 17:30.965
but I'm still in my feelings
about La'Britney

17:30.966 --> 17:34.260
not telling me that Stormey
had an issue with me.

17:34.261 --> 17:37.930
It's just like, you know,
what's going on here?

17:37.931 --> 17:39.640
I need answers.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.003
- Right?
- Yes, it is.

18:09.004 --> 18:12.840
-So I brought a couple chapters
from my book.

18:12.841 --> 18:18.763
I'm dedicating this to my mom,
who's no longer here,

18:18.764 --> 18:21.474
and also, um, to my sons.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.811
And maybe they'll understand
their crazy mom a little bit,

18:24.812 --> 18:27.355
[laughs] you know, like,
why is she so crazy?

18:27.356 --> 18:30.483
Today is a big day for me.
I'm really nervous about it.

18:30.484 --> 18:34.987
I want their true opinions about
what they think about my story.

18:34.988 --> 18:38.116
So if I get a little emotional
or if I stumble over something,

18:38.117 --> 18:42.411
sometimes it's kind of hard to
read your own stuff, you know?

18:42.412 --> 18:43.955
- We're ready.
- Y'all ready?

18:43.956 --> 18:46.332
- Yes!
- Okay.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.710
I definitely had a realization
about La'Britney

18:49.711 --> 18:52.505
when me and Mehgan
was talking the other day.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.383
Even though I'm definitely
still a little pissed,

18:55.384 --> 18:58.719
it's just not the time
to bring it up.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.806
Okay.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.017
"July 13th, 2020.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.770
This isn't just
any other day for me.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.481
The sun beams down on me
as I'm awarded

19:10.482 --> 19:12.150
the Spirit of Detroit plaque.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.070
To go from breaking the law
to this -- a full 180.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.073
It's a drastic change
from where my life started.

19:19.074 --> 19:20.783
Growing up in Detroit --
It wasn't easy.

19:20.784 --> 19:23.786
It was easy to get mixed up
in the fast life,

19:23.787 --> 19:25.955
dating hustlers,
driving fast cars,

19:25.956 --> 19:27.456
wearing full-length minks,

19:27.457 --> 19:30.418
and coveting the latest
ha-handbag."

19:30.419 --> 19:31.961
- Don't be nervous, T.
- I know!

19:31.962 --> 19:33.462
-You're over there shaking
and stressing.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.048
-I know! But it's just --
It's --

19:36.049 --> 19:37.842
I'm feeling nervous.
- Yeah.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.304
-For a woman who has sold drugs

19:41.305 --> 19:44.307
or, you know,
been around the world,

19:44.308 --> 19:47.894
you wouldn't think reading
a book would be this scary.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.313
But let me tell you, it is.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.106
-You have our undivided
attention.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.566
- You do.
- Okay.

19:53.567 --> 19:57.111
"After spending some 800 or so
odd nights in federal prison,

19:57.112 --> 19:59.614
I know I got off easy,
and only God knows

19:59.615 --> 20:01.782
that it was about time
I pay for the dirt

20:01.783 --> 20:03.159
I've done in my life.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.453
It was a small price to pay
to come home

20:05.454 --> 20:07.538
with my mind intact,
a loving family,

20:07.539 --> 20:09.665
and an opportunity
to build again,

20:09.666 --> 20:11.876
this time the right way."

20:11.877 --> 20:15.129
-Toni reading her book --
I feel very proud of her.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.464
- "I gotta get out."

20:16.465 --> 20:19.800
-You know, she's T's ex,
or T's current girlfriend,

20:19.801 --> 20:22.178
or she's the First Lady of BMF.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.804
You know, people might think
that she's, like,

20:23.805 --> 20:26.182
some kind of hard-core woman
and when she's actually

20:26.183 --> 20:27.767
a very soft woman,
you know what I mean?

20:27.768 --> 20:31.771
And so the book is just
humanizing herself, to me.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.733
-"Just then I strongly believe
God himself had come down

20:35.734 --> 20:39.612
and whispered that he had
better use for me."

20:39.613 --> 20:42.531
- Mm.
- Okay, snaps. Yes.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.242
-Thank you for sharing
that with us.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.576
-I'm ready to read
the whole book.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.620
-I know it takes
a lot of courage.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.914
- It does.
- I commend you for being brave

20:49.915 --> 20:52.750
enough to tell your story,
you know?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.418
That's what's up. Respect.

20:54.419 --> 20:56.045
- Yeah, 'cause it's really scary.
- Yeah.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.505
-Yeah, 'cause like I said,
I'm reliving.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.632
-You're exposing yourself
to everyone, yeah.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.217
-So I have to relive all that.

21:01.218 --> 21:05.596
And I started to feel a lot
of shame and regret, you know,

21:05.597 --> 21:07.682
and especially
that my mom is not here.

21:07.683 --> 21:10.935
I'm like, "God, I was -- I was
kind of horrible sometimes."

21:10.936 --> 21:14.105
I had to put a lot of pressure
on my family,

21:14.106 --> 21:17.858
you know, living this selfishly,
just like a, you know --

21:17.859 --> 21:19.777
I was just a time bomb.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.071
-But you were in --
You were in survival mode.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.990
- Yeah.
- And I know your mom is

21:23.991 --> 21:26.575
looking down and she is proud.
- Absolutely.

21:26.576 --> 21:28.035
- Yeah.
- She is proud.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.787
-Whew! That got...

21:29.788 --> 21:32.373
- She is proud.
- [Crying] I'm sorry.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.250
-It's okay, Miss T.
We proud of you.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.626
You did great.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.546
-It takes a lot of courage
to do what you're doing.

21:38.547 --> 21:40.214
You know what I mean?

21:40.215 --> 21:42.550
-It's so new. So new.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.343
[Sniffles]

21:44.344 --> 21:47.638
-Just think about all the lives
that you're about to touch,

21:47.639 --> 21:49.598
the women
that you're gonna help.

21:49.599 --> 21:53.686
- Yeah.
- Gotta give you a hug.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.313
-We got you, Toni.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.356
Thank you for sharing,
seriously.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.442
- Strong woman, for real.
- Aw!

21:59.443 --> 22:03.154
-[Normal voice] These are ladies
that have become my sisters.

22:03.155 --> 22:05.990
It felt really --
It felt really good.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.908
They embraced me, you know,

22:07.909 --> 22:12.705
and just coming over these
obstacles of, you know, my life,

22:12.706 --> 22:16.292
and now I have these girls
and I have the support of them,

22:16.293 --> 22:17.585
I just feel good.

22:17.586 --> 22:22.132
I mean, it felt good
to be able to read it to them.

22:23.258 --> 22:26.469
[Sighs]
- So how's your family taking it?

22:26.470 --> 22:30.389
-You know, um,
I have three sons, um,

22:30.390 --> 22:35.186
and I haven't been able
to share it with them yet, um...

22:35.187 --> 22:37.480
but hopefully before it's done,

22:37.481 --> 22:40.358
we'll all be able to sit down
and talk about it,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.485
and they'll get
to read it first.

22:42.486 --> 22:43.861
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

22:43.862 --> 22:46.572
-So I need a signed and
autographed copy, period.

22:46.573 --> 22:47.698
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

22:47.699 --> 22:50.076
-You are a notorious queen,
for real.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.745
- We all are notorious queens.
- Real life.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.705
-Your own way, yes.
[Laughs]

22:54.706 --> 22:57.666
-Group hug.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.918

23:25.695 --> 23:27.780
-Hey, girl, hey!
How are you?

23:27.781 --> 23:30.032
-Just calling for some updates!

23:30.033 --> 23:31.659
So, where my man at?

23:31.660 --> 23:34.245
-Well, our last discussion,
you were talking about

23:34.246 --> 23:36.455
the types of men
you were interested in,

23:36.456 --> 23:38.290
this list that exists,

23:38.291 --> 23:42.211
um, that you know,
in many aspects is realistic,

23:42.212 --> 23:43.838
in some aspects, not so much.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.590
-I want a guy
that's 6-foot minimum.

23:46.591 --> 23:47.925
I want him to have nice hair.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.301
I don't want him
to have any kids.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.970
I want to marry me
a Black man, period,

23:50.971 --> 23:53.013
'cause, you know,
Black Lives Matter, okay?

23:53.014 --> 23:55.850
I want him to have money.
I want him to be successful,

23:55.851 --> 23:57.893
like, well-known and respected.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.187
-So, um, I've been
going through the process

24:00.188 --> 24:04.567
of looking for,
evaluating, uh, men for you.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.111
And as I was going
through my database,

24:07.112 --> 24:08.737
I came across a guy.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.906
He's a wellness entrepreneur.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.034
He owns his own business.
He makes six figures.

24:14.035 --> 24:16.370
He's very driven.
He's successful.

24:16.371 --> 24:17.746
-Is he darker than a paper bag?

24:17.747 --> 24:20.875
-He is dark-skinned, yes.
And he is fine.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.752
You know, I know the income
was a real, you know,

24:23.753 --> 24:25.045
sticking point for you.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.797
You wanted someone
who was self-sufficient,

24:26.798 --> 24:28.966
someone who attractive enough
to be on your arm,

24:28.967 --> 24:30.551
and he hits all of those marks.

24:30.552 --> 24:33.637
But I will say,
I've come across an obstacle.

24:33.638 --> 24:34.763
-An obstacle?

24:34.764 --> 24:36.599
I was so excited
when Jasmine told me

24:36.600 --> 24:37.808
that she found me a guy.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.727
Like, oh, my God,
my perfect match, my man,

24:39.728 --> 24:42.897
my husband, my future husband,
who knows, my baby daddy.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.692
And now she telling me
about some obstacle.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.943
What type of obstacle?

24:47.944 --> 24:50.488
Yo, there's a billion people
in the world,

24:50.489 --> 24:52.072
like 4 billion, to be exact.

24:52.073 --> 24:56.660
There has to be one guy
that matches my list.

24:56.661 --> 24:59.955
-Absolutely matches some
of the things on the list,

24:59.956 --> 25:01.749
but not every single thing.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.710
You know, I know how you feel.
I see your face.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.045
What is your first thought?

25:06.046 --> 25:08.589
- 5'11".
- He's 5'9".

25:08.590 --> 25:11.717
-Oh, my God, girl.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.219
Will you be able to pick me up?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.678
-Pick you up in what way?

25:14.679 --> 25:17.389
-I'm thick.
There's a lot back here to hold.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.850
-Well, let me tell you,
he's -- he's fit.

25:19.851 --> 25:23.437
So he will not have any
problems with picking you up.

25:23.438 --> 25:25.856
I'm a thicky.
I come from the South.

25:25.857 --> 25:28.150
We eat cabbage
and macaroni and cheese,

25:28.151 --> 25:30.903
and, like, I want my man
to be able to pick me up

25:30.904 --> 25:34.156
and, like, you know,
throw me around.

25:34.157 --> 25:37.660
And I don't see a little man
that's 5'9" or whatever

25:37.661 --> 25:39.078
being able to do that.

25:39.079 --> 25:42.582
-But here's the other part.
He has a kid.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.043
-How old is this kid?

25:46.044 --> 25:48.128
-Child is 8.

25:48.129 --> 25:51.549
-Strike number two.
Shorty has a kid!

25:51.550 --> 25:52.883
I don't date guys with kids

25:52.884 --> 25:54.969
'cause they always go back
to their baby mom.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.595
What happened with him
and his baby mama?

25:56.596 --> 25:58.305
Because, you know, I said
I wasn't getting with

25:58.306 --> 26:00.516
no guy that had no kids
unless they baby mom had died

26:00.517 --> 26:01.934
or something already.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.019
-Okay, well, she didn't die,

26:04.020 --> 26:06.647
but they do have
a good relationship, so...

26:06.648 --> 26:08.107
- A good relationship?
- They're co-parenting

26:08.108 --> 26:10.025
in a positive way.
- How good?

26:10.026 --> 26:12.570
-Well, I mean, obviously,
they're not sleeping together.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.364
- Oh, how do you know?
- [ Laughs ]

26:15.365 --> 26:18.158
Listen, listen,
there's a lot of people

26:18.159 --> 26:21.954
who have kids that don't
sleep with their exes.

26:21.955 --> 26:24.331
-I don't know.
Do I have a plan B,

26:24.332 --> 26:27.001
or just this is --
Is this plan A, B, C, D, and E?

26:27.002 --> 26:29.128
