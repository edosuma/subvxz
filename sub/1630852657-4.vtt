WEBVTT

00:08.916 --> 00:14.000
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:16.000 --> 00:19.125
I knew I'd find you here,
but not like that.

00:19.625 --> 00:20.750
What's up with you?

00:21.791 --> 00:22.625
Come here.

00:23.875 --> 00:25.791
Lay down. Wow.

00:26.916 --> 00:28.166
Now, look up,

00:29.958 --> 00:33.208
and imagine if the world
were upside down like this.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.666
It'd be beautiful, huh?

00:35.875 --> 00:36.708
Yeah.

00:37.958 --> 00:39.333
It's really beautiful.

00:39.416 --> 00:43.416
Vilma will turn upside down
if we're late for our shift.

00:44.041 --> 00:45.541
She won't stop talking.

00:51.416 --> 00:52.250
Hey…

00:58.541 --> 00:59.916
You don't need to hide.

01:01.958 --> 01:03.375
I feel the same way.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.333
What the hell, Miguel?

02:00.666 --> 02:01.541
Chai, I--

02:02.916 --> 02:05.708
I saw that you got my texts.

02:07.375 --> 02:09.916
I know it must be hard for you,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.208
but I almost didn't sleep
trying to talk to you.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.875
Good morning! Look what I've brought you.

02:15.958 --> 02:20.125
Just the way you like it.
No sweetener, no sugar, no fun.

02:20.625 --> 02:21.916
Yasmin, no.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.583
Please, get up. You promised
you were going to help me.

02:25.666 --> 02:26.541
All right.

02:27.666 --> 02:28.708
Ah.

02:30.125 --> 02:30.958
Here.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.166
What's this?

02:34.166 --> 02:36.875
-A BuzzFeed quiz?
-Exactly, do it.

02:39.458 --> 02:42.583
"Do you feel you'll only be happy
after buying stuff?"

02:43.083 --> 02:45.250
No lying, Catarina.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.750
"Do you feel empty after buying stuff?"

02:48.833 --> 02:51.291
YES - NO

02:51.375 --> 02:53.166
"Have you ever felt depressed?"

02:54.208 --> 02:55.041
YES - NO

02:55.125 --> 02:58.250
Why wasn't this on my SATs?
I'd have aced it.

02:59.250 --> 03:02.708
Okay, conclusion:
"Your result might indicate oniomania."

03:03.291 --> 03:05.375
See why I don't like this? It's overkill.

03:05.458 --> 03:06.583
It's a diagnosis.

03:06.666 --> 03:09.375
Check the results, go ahead.
See what it means.

03:09.458 --> 03:14.708
"Oniomania: an obsessive urge
to buy things in order to seek happiness

03:14.791 --> 03:15.875
even if…"

03:17.500 --> 03:20.833
"Even if they harm themselves or others."

03:24.458 --> 03:27.583
Let's assume this is true--

03:27.666 --> 03:29.791
Assuming this is true…

03:32.250 --> 03:34.041
I read that the first step

03:35.500 --> 03:37.208
is to get rid of temptation.

03:39.666 --> 03:40.583
Okay, but how?

03:40.666 --> 03:42.916
Well, I would donate it,

03:43.000 --> 03:47.041
but I've also read
it's better if you decide.

03:48.750 --> 03:50.166
I can sell it.

03:51.791 --> 03:54.333
I can start an online thrift shop,
you know?

03:54.416 --> 03:57.125
We can buy an air-conditioning
with the money.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.000
Now we're talking.

04:00.375 --> 04:03.750
Wow, I can't believe this ugly bag
is so expensive.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.416
-Jeez.
-It's so pretty.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.875
-Good morning.
-Morning.

04:14.833 --> 04:15.791
You look pretty.

04:21.750 --> 04:22.666
Are you okay?

04:24.083 --> 04:27.083
-I need to talk to you--
-Mom, Diego's here!

04:27.750 --> 04:31.166
Diego, I'm so glad you came!
Check out my drawing.

04:31.833 --> 04:33.083
It's beautiful!

04:33.166 --> 04:34.625
It's called "My Family."

04:36.541 --> 04:39.125
Did you do it for your painting classes?

04:39.208 --> 04:40.041
Yes.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.916
-Is it today?
-You're coming, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:44.708
-Do you want me to?
-Yes.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.875
Give me a hug.

04:47.750 --> 04:49.416
Honey, come here.

04:50.416 --> 04:51.583
Come here with me.

04:51.666 --> 04:55.291
Mommy already told you
who your dad is, remember?

04:57.541 --> 04:59.250
Diego is just Mommy's friend.

05:00.791 --> 05:02.791
I'll have to make another drawing.

05:02.875 --> 05:06.166
-Hey. I'll help you later, okay?
-Yay!

05:11.416 --> 05:12.500
Do you wanna talk?

05:13.833 --> 05:14.666
Not now.

05:15.458 --> 05:18.708
Sofia! Come here, I need to dress you up!

05:26.125 --> 05:28.916
<i>If you need anything,</i>
<i>call me and I'll help you.</i>

05:29.000 --> 05:31.166
As my dad always says,

05:31.250 --> 05:34.166
"Long-standing clients
deserve special treatment."

05:36.250 --> 05:37.833
Sure. Perfect.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.541
All right. See you next time.

05:41.625 --> 05:45.958
OMNIA ENTERPRISES

05:46.041 --> 05:47.125
Tired already?

05:48.708 --> 05:51.416
Why introduce me to clients?
Don't they know me?

05:51.500 --> 05:54.708
No. They knew you
when you were just a boy,

05:54.791 --> 05:58.291
and didn't commit to anything.
But you've changed.

05:58.375 --> 06:00.958
Now they'll know a real man,

06:01.041 --> 06:04.041
who fights for the company
that will be his someday.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.625
Isn't that right? Huh?

06:38.541 --> 06:41.541
Son, you need to talk to Guimarães.

06:41.625 --> 06:43.541
There's something wrong with--

07:07.666 --> 07:08.500
Look.

07:09.916 --> 07:13.500
Ta-da! I've promoted my shop
on my profile.

07:14.958 --> 07:18.083
I'm happy for you.
You've taken a big step today.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.416
You knew this day would come, right?

07:22.083 --> 07:24.083
What about your guy? Any texts?

07:24.750 --> 07:29.250
No. I'm going out with Maresia later,
and there's no signal there.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.541
What for?

07:32.250 --> 07:33.291
A tour.

07:33.791 --> 07:34.666
By boat.

07:35.166 --> 07:36.625
Wow!

07:37.208 --> 07:41.083
Where's that city girl
afraid of water and boats?

07:41.166 --> 07:43.916
It's a long story, Catarina.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.083
-Someone's interested.
-He sent me an audio.

07:48.166 --> 07:49.916
I knew it! It's a designer bag.

07:50.416 --> 07:52.291
-Oh no--
-What is this?

07:52.375 --> 07:54.875
-What's going on?
-Is the internet down?

07:54.958 --> 07:56.958
You've gotta be kidding me.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.166
-I'll try the hallway.
-Okay.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.500
For Christ's sake, it can't be.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.541
Reception desk.

08:05.916 --> 08:07.000
No connection?

08:08.208 --> 08:09.916
Okay. All right.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.583
I'll check it.

08:13.791 --> 08:14.625
Hello?

08:15.833 --> 08:16.666
Hello?

08:20.041 --> 08:21.500
Hey, Big Rider!

08:22.083 --> 08:26.208
Are you ready for the whales?
I just need my copilot.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.291
Maresia, I'm not gonna make it today.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.625
Checkout time is over, it's less busy now.

08:35.125 --> 08:35.958
But I--

08:37.125 --> 08:41.458
I'm waiting for a call from a supplier.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.083
Yasmin, are people complaining
about the Wi-Fi?

08:46.166 --> 08:50.375
Yes. They were calling,
but even the landline is dead now.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.041
Call the staff and tell them

08:52.125 --> 08:54.458
we'll have an emergency briefing in 30.

08:54.541 --> 08:55.541
-Okay.
-Thank you.

09:00.333 --> 09:03.041
Love, there's a network cable
in the warehouse.

09:03.125 --> 09:06.708
That was the issue last time.
Can you check it for me?

09:07.875 --> 09:09.958
-Sure.
-I'll check the radio.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.291
<i>Please, hold. We'll be with you shortly.</i>

09:29.125 --> 09:32.875
DNA PATERNITY TEST

09:36.000 --> 09:37.875
Vilma? Is Maresia here?

09:37.958 --> 09:39.333
He's in the warehouse.

09:39.916 --> 09:40.875
Nice tune.

09:40.958 --> 09:43.458
Not when you've heard it three times.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.083
Thank you.

09:46.041 --> 09:47.166
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:49.333 --> 09:50.958
<i>Please hold.</i>

09:53.208 --> 09:55.625
I think you don't remember,

09:56.125 --> 09:58.625
but last time you asked me to train you--

09:59.375 --> 10:02.666
No, sorry. You can't remember
because you weren't there.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.208
I was there, I remember.

10:04.291 --> 10:06.833
The referee wanted
to start the competition,

10:06.916 --> 10:09.583
and I begged him to wait five minutes

10:09.666 --> 10:12.333
because my student would be there soon.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.000
But you never showed up.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.208
Hold this.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.166
Maresia, I was only 13, okay? Thirteen.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.791
I've changed. I'm willing to try.

10:21.875 --> 10:22.875
Have you changed?

10:25.958 --> 10:28.500
To show you
this is water under the bridge,

10:28.583 --> 10:32.083
I want to invest in your time.
What's your price?

10:35.125 --> 10:39.500
I'll tell you something
that may be hard for you to understand,

10:39.583 --> 10:41.166
but I'll tell you anyway.

10:41.916 --> 10:44.625
There are some things money can't buy.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.333
Trust is one of them.

10:47.291 --> 10:50.333
You told your dad
about Miguel, didn't you?

10:52.875 --> 10:56.416
Maybe you haven't changed
as much as you think.

10:57.833 --> 10:58.875
Never mind.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.041
I can get by.

11:06.375 --> 11:10.375
I've gathered you because we need
to act fast as a team, okay?

11:10.875 --> 11:14.625
I've talked to the provider,
and the issue is on the antenna.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.875
We need to keep the guests calm
until the issue is resolved.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.166
You know they hate not having internet.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.000
I printed some posters.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.458
Let's hang them in the hallways
and around the hotel.

11:26.541 --> 11:29.333
I've just come from the sea,
and the signal was fine.

11:29.916 --> 11:32.208
No, it must be Floripa's. Right?

11:32.291 --> 11:35.458
…at the seashore,
but they go crazy without internet.

11:36.458 --> 11:40.708
So, I'll repeat.
We need to keep calm today, okay?

11:40.791 --> 11:43.208
Are you waiting for Beyoncé to call you?

11:44.166 --> 11:46.666
Quiet, guys, I need to keep going.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.583
If anyone asks about the Wi-Fi,

11:48.666 --> 11:51.916
you'll say we're taking
the necessary measures.

11:52.958 --> 11:55.625
-If they ask which measures--
-Yasmin, relax.

11:56.208 --> 11:59.458
I was just being curious.
We wanna know, right, Conrado?

12:00.166 --> 12:01.458
It's my boyfriend.

12:01.541 --> 12:04.083
We'll call the provider and pray on it.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.000
Wow.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.125
She's full of surprises.

12:08.666 --> 12:11.833
So, have a nice day at work.
Let's do this.

12:12.416 --> 12:13.250
Let's go.

12:14.666 --> 12:15.916
-Miguel.
-Hey.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.666
Can you come to my office in ten?

12:18.750 --> 12:19.958
Yes, boss.

12:38.916 --> 12:40.541
I'll leave this here, okay?

12:46.958 --> 12:49.000
Hey, this isn't the locker room!

12:49.666 --> 12:52.916
Don't worry, I'm not naked.
Just look the other way.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.791
Unless you miss it.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.666
Rodrigo, please.

12:59.791 --> 13:03.541
Can you keep it for me, please? Okay?

13:23.333 --> 13:24.375
Aloha, I'm here.

13:25.125 --> 13:26.875
What is it? The Wi-Fi?

13:27.750 --> 13:28.708
The Wi-Fi--

13:29.833 --> 13:31.000
Have a seat, Miguel.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.000
I'll go straight to the point, okay?

13:35.833 --> 13:38.833
You know drugs are not allowed
in the hotel, right?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.125
I know, and I'm against it.

13:41.875 --> 13:43.750
Did they find anything? I know.

13:43.833 --> 13:47.625
-At the long-haired guy's bungalow, right?
-Elias found this.

13:50.375 --> 13:51.541
What happened?

13:54.666 --> 13:55.666
What is it?

13:55.750 --> 13:58.666
Are you the boss's son's mule now?

13:59.750 --> 14:02.833
I've tried hard for you
to stay on this island.

14:02.916 --> 14:04.583
I confronted my partner again

14:04.666 --> 14:08.583
because I know
how much this job matters to you.

14:08.666 --> 14:10.458
So, please, man.

14:10.541 --> 14:12.500
Don't force my hand on this.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.708
Miguel.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.250
This is the first

14:23.333 --> 14:26.875
and the last time
we're having this conversation.

14:27.375 --> 14:28.208
Okay?

14:35.541 --> 14:39.041
-Miguel, are you okay?
-Yeah.

14:39.708 --> 14:40.541
Hey!

14:42.875 --> 14:44.000
Holy crap!

14:46.041 --> 14:47.250
I'll help you.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.166
Thank you.

15:13.541 --> 15:14.458
Miguel!

15:18.375 --> 15:21.500
Hey! Calm down.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.583
Relax, I'm here.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.125
Come on, breathe for me.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.916
One, two, three, inhale, exhale.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.625
Deep breaths, come on. Fill your lungs.

15:29.708 --> 15:32.333
Come on, I'm with you. Breathe for me.

15:34.083 --> 15:37.250
Yes, that's it. Come on, slowly now.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.166
Oh God, what a day.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.083
Did the provider call?

15:45.750 --> 15:46.625
Maresia?

15:47.458 --> 15:50.375
-Did you hear me?
-Yes. No, they didn't call.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.291
It's been a terrible day.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.833
Hey. Excuse me.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.208
I just wanted to know if our tour stands.

16:01.041 --> 16:03.375
Yay. Absolutely.

16:04.416 --> 16:06.750
Affirmative, copilot.

16:06.833 --> 16:09.583
Sorry, Yasmin,
this has nothing to do with you.

16:10.458 --> 16:14.666
It's chaotic in here. We have no internet,
we don't know when it'll be back.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.875
Are you gonna leave me alone here?

16:16.958 --> 16:20.666
Honey, I think that
it can be good for our guests,

16:20.750 --> 16:25.250
they won't spend so much time
on their phones. It's like a detox.

16:25.833 --> 16:29.125
And when the signal is back,
whenever it might be,

16:29.208 --> 16:32.708
it won't make any difference
if I'm here waiting

16:33.291 --> 16:34.583
or at the sea.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.041
We'll be back soon.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.291
Okay?

16:42.208 --> 16:43.041
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.291
Yay!

16:48.041 --> 16:48.875
So?

16:50.291 --> 16:51.208
Feeling better?

16:59.083 --> 17:02.000
-Why?
-What? What the hell?

17:02.666 --> 17:05.458
What the fuck? I'm trying to help you!

17:05.541 --> 17:07.458
Here it is. Sorry for the delay.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.833
Miss, I didn't order this.

17:10.666 --> 17:12.666
-I don't want peanuts.
-Just a sec.

17:13.541 --> 17:14.916
I'm trying to help you!

17:15.000 --> 17:18.166
Help me? By stabbing my back?

17:18.250 --> 17:19.875
Fuck! I didn't tell on you!

17:21.250 --> 17:23.791
I don't know what happened,
but I didn't tell on you!

17:26.125 --> 17:28.708
Yes, you did. That's what you do!

17:29.458 --> 17:32.791
You put my ass on the line!
You've always been like this!

17:32.875 --> 17:35.291
Don't point your finger! I'm not a child!

17:35.916 --> 17:38.416
I'm not a snitch!
Is it hard to believe me?

17:40.083 --> 17:42.666
-I'm trying to help you.
-Leave me alone.

17:42.750 --> 17:44.083
Please, Rodrigo.

17:46.000 --> 17:46.833
Go.

18:22.708 --> 18:23.541
Hi.

18:24.083 --> 18:27.458
-Hi. How are you?
-What's up? You know what I was thinking?

18:27.541 --> 18:29.666
Lifeguards help people, right?

18:31.416 --> 18:33.791
What is a person who helps lifeguards?

18:34.750 --> 18:35.583
I don't know.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.708
A guardian angel?

18:37.791 --> 18:40.458
I like it. That's me, your guardian angel.

18:43.958 --> 18:44.791
Thank you.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.166
I mean, even life on Earth.

18:57.250 --> 19:01.000
The first life form on Earth
appeared underwater, in the sea.

19:01.083 --> 19:02.333
The first bacteria.

19:03.708 --> 19:07.250
We, humans, when we're inside
our mom's belly, we're--

19:08.500 --> 19:09.875
we're underwater, right?

19:11.041 --> 19:15.916
This thing about people wanting to see
other planets doesn't make sense

19:16.000 --> 19:19.416
when we have so much yet to explore
under the sea, right?

19:19.916 --> 19:24.208
I doubt there's an ET
more incredible than whales.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.833
Did you know
whales and hippos are cousins?

19:30.083 --> 19:32.583
-Wow, but they look nothing alike.
-Yep.

19:35.625 --> 19:39.625
What I like the most about whales
is the way they communicate,

19:39.708 --> 19:42.125
by singing far away from each other.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.208
They don't need cellphones.

19:44.291 --> 19:48.958
When they wanna talk,
they say, "Girlfriend!"

19:52.125 --> 19:53.791
Come here!

19:53.875 --> 19:55.833
Get on the boat!

19:57.416 --> 19:58.291
Come on.

20:04.125 --> 20:05.125
Watch your step.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.625
B, insolation.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.666
Good job! Correct.

20:18.750 --> 20:19.958
Okay, last one.

20:20.666 --> 20:23.125
"Check the option…" No peeking.

20:23.208 --> 20:26.541
"…indicating the consequences
of drowning."

20:26.625 --> 20:29.791
"A, decreasing carbon dioxide."

20:29.875 --> 20:31.416
"B, hyper…"

20:31.500 --> 20:32.958
-Hyperoxia.
-Yes.

20:33.458 --> 20:37.083
-"C, lactic acid accumulation."
-Okay.

20:37.750 --> 20:41.333
The lack of oxygen forces the cells
to work anaerobically,

20:41.416 --> 20:43.458
resulting in lactic acid.

20:43.541 --> 20:45.500
So, letter C.

20:46.583 --> 20:47.583
I'm in shock!

20:48.791 --> 20:51.375
I didn't know you were a biology genius.
Good job!

20:52.583 --> 20:53.416
Let me see.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.541
Okay. So, now, the next level.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.583
We need more space.

21:00.666 --> 21:03.083
-So, let's go.
-Yes.

21:03.166 --> 21:06.125
THE WI-FI IS DOWN
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE

21:07.458 --> 21:09.458
It's chaotic today, huh?

21:09.541 --> 21:11.958
That must be Mercury retrograde, I swear.

21:13.208 --> 21:14.166
Conrado,

21:15.458 --> 21:17.041
aren't you feeling this?

21:17.125 --> 21:18.041
Feeling what?

21:18.625 --> 21:20.250
This terrible vibe!

21:23.291 --> 21:25.666
You've been talking to Marília too much.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.333
First, the Wi-Fi,

21:27.416 --> 21:30.500
then a guest is rude to me
'cause his order was wrong.

21:30.583 --> 21:31.791
And Miguel's fight.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.833
-It's not a coincidence.
-What happened?

21:33.916 --> 21:36.791
He said he ordered a rosemary drink,
I wrote peanuts.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.583
I blame the Wi-Fi. If we had--

21:38.666 --> 21:40.416
No. What happened to Miguel?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.791
He left Maresia's office stumbling.

21:42.875 --> 21:45.250
He was pale. He knocked down my peanuts.

21:45.333 --> 21:48.791
He looked like Will, from <i>Stranger Things</i>,
in the upside down. Weird.

21:48.875 --> 21:52.333
Miguel was just like him.
And I'm not one to gossip,

21:52.416 --> 21:56.208
you know me, but right after that,
he was fighting with Rodrigo.

21:56.791 --> 21:57.916
Out of the blue.

21:58.666 --> 21:59.791
I think I know why.

22:00.666 --> 22:02.708
Look, hold this for me, okay?

22:08.875 --> 22:11.291
Gosh! Stay here!

22:12.041 --> 22:14.250
It's late to save this one, isn't it?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.666
-Do you think?
-I have an idea.

22:16.750 --> 22:17.583
What?

22:18.375 --> 22:20.625
-What?
-Help me, I'm drowning.

22:22.333 --> 22:23.375
That's better, right?

22:23.458 --> 22:25.458
Drowners don't speak.

22:26.708 --> 22:29.166
Let's see. The first step

22:29.250 --> 22:31.416
is lying the victim on their back.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.333
-Excuse me.
-Your hand is cold.

22:34.416 --> 22:35.958
Excuse me. Okay.

22:36.041 --> 22:38.916
-Wow. Are you dead?
-Yes.

22:39.791 --> 22:42.125
Okay. Done.

22:42.208 --> 22:45.166
Next step, opening the airway.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.041
Okay.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.625
Close the nostrils.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.125
Like this.

22:51.208 --> 22:52.333
Okay.

22:53.083 --> 22:55.000
-And--
-Will it take too long?

22:55.583 --> 22:56.416
Hold on.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.458
It's the last step.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.875
Artificial ventilation.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.750
We should stop here.

23:14.375 --> 23:17.041
I have to be somewhere else now.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.833
-Okay.
-I'm leaving. Okay?

23:18.916 --> 23:21.333
-Can you tidy up later?
-Sure.

23:21.416 --> 23:23.125
-Thank you.
-No problem.

24:14.083 --> 24:16.958
What are you planning to study in college?

24:17.958 --> 24:21.416
-I'm sorry?
-As a career. What do you like?

24:21.916 --> 24:25.666
I applied to journalism,
but I didn't hear from them yet.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.916
Vilma studied journalism too.

24:28.666 --> 24:31.791
I studied social science.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.125
-Really?
-Yeah.

24:33.208 --> 24:36.750
I didn't know if I should try
social science or journalism.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.333
-Really?
-Yeah. How was it?

24:38.916 --> 24:41.541
I wasn't ready, I was too young.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.458
I dropped out.

24:50.875 --> 24:52.083
Got it.

25:13.083 --> 25:15.041
I knew I'd find you here.

25:17.916 --> 25:20.291
What's up, Conrado? What are you up to?

25:27.125 --> 25:28.375
I know what happened.

25:29.625 --> 25:31.625
-Are you okay?
-Yep.

25:32.291 --> 25:34.791
I just learned that I need to be smarter.

25:35.625 --> 25:37.500
Was that all you had to learn?

25:38.750 --> 25:39.750
What do you mean?

25:40.583 --> 25:42.416
Don't you think it was a sign

25:43.791 --> 25:47.583
of something bigger
trying to show you a better path?

25:47.666 --> 25:49.875
Conrado, believe it or not,

25:50.375 --> 25:53.166
the bad things I do are for the better.

25:54.750 --> 25:57.583
Listen, this thing about right and wrong

25:57.666 --> 25:59.041
is very relative to me.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.250
I'm not judging you.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.833
I just think that if it were true,

26:04.916 --> 26:07.375
you wouldn't be in trouble all the time.

26:12.541 --> 26:14.208
Look, I believe in God,

26:14.291 --> 26:18.416
but we haven't talked for a while,
so I've learned to live by myself.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.541
That's where you're wrong.

26:21.125 --> 26:23.041
You've never been alone.

26:23.791 --> 26:25.208
Miguel, look at you.

26:26.666 --> 26:28.625
God's always been with you.

26:29.375 --> 26:30.541
Just talk to Him.

26:32.208 --> 26:33.208
Talk to God?

26:34.041 --> 26:34.958
Talk to God.

26:35.666 --> 26:36.666
I mean it, man.

26:38.041 --> 26:39.583
The way you want to.

26:42.333 --> 26:43.333
What's up, God?

26:44.125 --> 26:45.000
How are You?

26:46.291 --> 26:47.458
So,

26:47.875 --> 26:50.250
it's been a long time, I know.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.708
I'm here with Conrado. Anyway,

26:53.791 --> 26:56.333
if You think I should change my lifestyle,

26:56.416 --> 27:00.458
send me a sign.
A smoke signal, maybe a DM,

27:00.958 --> 27:02.041
an angel emoji.

27:02.833 --> 27:04.416
Anything, okay?

27:06.000 --> 27:06.833
Done.

27:22.625 --> 27:23.875
Oh man!

27:26.583 --> 27:28.041
Nobody will believe this!

27:39.083 --> 27:40.041
Are you okay?

27:44.958 --> 27:45.791
What?

27:48.708 --> 27:49.875
Let's go back.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.125
<i>Yasmin?</i>

28:49.291 --> 28:50.375
Yasmin?

28:55.000 --> 28:56.083
Yasmin?

28:57.583 --> 28:59.041
Yasmin, are you okay?

29:01.208 --> 29:03.125
Hey.

29:05.000 --> 29:05.958
What happened?

29:14.833 --> 29:16.375
How are you feeling?

29:19.958 --> 29:20.833
Guilty.

29:21.625 --> 29:23.541
No, you shouldn't.

29:23.625 --> 29:27.125
Accidents happen.
I should've given you a life jacket.

29:29.416 --> 29:31.083
That's not what I mean.

29:33.750 --> 29:34.625
I lied.

29:35.958 --> 29:38.333
I lied about who I am.

29:39.500 --> 29:40.583
I can't swim.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.166
This was the first time
I got into the water.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.041
I know nothing about whales.

29:46.125 --> 29:49.541
Those pictures, I asked Catarina
to go into the sea for me.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.708
I have no idea what a big rider is.

29:55.833 --> 29:59.875
But I never asked you
because when I say that, you smile at me.

30:00.666 --> 30:01.500
See?

30:05.083 --> 30:07.208
I've dreamed about seeing this smile

30:08.291 --> 30:09.583
my whole life.

30:13.416 --> 30:15.791
Yasmin, when you fell off the boat,

30:15.875 --> 30:17.375
I was looking for you,

30:18.333 --> 30:20.000
and I couldn't see you.

30:22.208 --> 30:23.833
And you wouldn't come back.

30:26.208 --> 30:27.833
I felt so empty inside,

30:28.833 --> 30:30.500
like I've never felt before.

30:33.291 --> 30:35.083
You're an amazing girl.

30:37.250 --> 30:40.000
And there's nothing in this world, Yasmin,

30:40.791 --> 30:42.416
that'll change this.

30:53.708 --> 30:54.583
Maresia!

30:56.666 --> 30:57.750
It's a whale!

30:59.000 --> 30:59.833
Look!

31:24.541 --> 31:28.458
This was the most beautiful drawing
of the exhibition, you know?

31:29.458 --> 31:30.416
I'll keep it.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.875
I'll pay it by tickling
the most intelligent girl in the world!

31:36.250 --> 31:38.000
Mom, isn't Diego really nice?

31:38.916 --> 31:39.791
Yeah.

31:40.916 --> 31:42.958
I'm kidding, Sofia. This is yours.

31:43.666 --> 31:44.666
I just had an idea.

31:44.750 --> 31:46.875
I'll draw your family.

31:47.750 --> 31:48.833
How's your family?

31:50.916 --> 31:52.750
Do you have a little brother?

31:54.958 --> 31:57.791
It's snack time!
The last one won't drink juice!

32:01.166 --> 32:02.333
I won!

32:12.541 --> 32:13.541
Does it hurt?

32:14.291 --> 32:15.250
A little bit.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.875
Oh God, it's all wet now.

32:21.916 --> 32:23.166
Look at this picture.

32:25.875 --> 32:26.791
Where is it?

32:27.291 --> 32:29.000
It doesn't look like this island.

32:29.750 --> 32:30.750
It is Caraíva.

32:31.791 --> 32:34.083
Many years ago.

32:35.791 --> 32:39.333
This picture was taken
by a very special person.

32:41.708 --> 32:42.583
My mom?

32:46.791 --> 32:49.666
When I dropped out of college,

32:49.750 --> 32:52.375
I decided I wanted to travel the world

32:52.875 --> 32:55.791
on a sailing boat.
A brilliant idea, right?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.125
I spent months getting ready,

32:59.666 --> 33:03.083
and I sank on the bay, at the first stop.

33:03.625 --> 33:04.958
Did you get hurt?

33:05.625 --> 33:07.250
No, not on the outside.

33:08.416 --> 33:10.333
But in that moment I realized

33:10.833 --> 33:14.541
that things don't always go as planned.

33:14.625 --> 33:15.458
Oh.

33:16.166 --> 33:18.458
-That's a fact, look at us.
-Yeah.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.666
But that's not always bad.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.958
This picture reminds me of that.

33:24.458 --> 33:26.250
If I hadn't sunk,

33:26.750 --> 33:28.666
we wouldn't be here right now.

33:30.375 --> 33:34.000
And there's no other place in the world

33:34.666 --> 33:35.958
I'd rather be.

33:40.416 --> 33:43.250
-Was it on this trip that--
-Yes, it was.

33:43.333 --> 33:48.125
This is the best proof that the best thing

33:49.000 --> 33:51.083
is just going with the flow.

33:53.041 --> 33:54.541
Right, Big Rider?

33:57.625 --> 34:00.500
Won't you tell me what it means?

34:00.583 --> 34:01.666
Yes, I will.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.000
Big rider is what we call

34:05.041 --> 34:07.916
a careless surfer

34:09.333 --> 34:10.875
who faces the sea

34:11.583 --> 34:13.458
without being afraid of it.

34:27.416 --> 34:29.708
Don't touch it! I'm gonna be sick.

34:31.625 --> 34:34.666
-Is it burning?
-I had it worse falling off the skate.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.458
-Is it here?
-Yes.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.791
-Thank you.
-Don't get used to it.

34:43.875 --> 34:45.791
-This isn't your locker.
-I know.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.000
The sea was wild today.

34:49.958 --> 34:52.458
But you know me, I can get by.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.291
Meet you at the beach tomorrow?

35:03.125 --> 35:04.541
What about the internet?

35:05.333 --> 35:06.541
Thank God it's back.

35:06.625 --> 35:10.083
Yay. I'll change my clothes
and come back to help you.

35:10.166 --> 35:13.250
Okay. Let me apply this.

35:14.625 --> 35:15.750
I think it'll help.

35:17.250 --> 35:19.000
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

35:20.458 --> 35:22.583
-Thanks, Vilma.
-No problem.

35:23.708 --> 35:24.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

35:26.083 --> 35:28.250
-Let me see.
-Look. I'm brand new.

35:39.958 --> 35:44.125
Let me tell you something
that will make you happy.

35:44.208 --> 35:45.125
Wait for it.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.791
Guess who sold everything?

35:48.666 --> 35:50.291
Wow, a businesswoman.

35:50.375 --> 35:53.291
The guy will meet me here,
I don't have to leave.

35:53.375 --> 35:55.333
A guy? Is he hot?

35:55.416 --> 35:56.708
We'll see.

35:57.833 --> 36:00.166
What about your guy? Any news?

36:00.791 --> 36:03.083
I need to check. My phone died.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.916
Put it on rice.

36:17.291 --> 36:20.708
<i>I'm sorry for the delay, Yasmin.</i>
<i>I've been hiding.</i>

36:21.500 --> 36:25.458
<i>There's no easy way to say this,</i>
<i>so I'll go straight to the point.</i>

36:25.541 --> 36:27.250
<i>We can't see each other anymore.</i>

36:28.375 --> 36:30.000
<i>So, it's over.</i>

36:31.166 --> 36:32.541
<i>It's for the best.</i>

36:34.000 --> 36:34.958
<i>Take care.</i>

36:48.958 --> 36:51.458
She fell asleep. The poor thing was tired.

36:52.833 --> 36:55.500
I'm sorry for not telling you I was going.

36:55.583 --> 36:57.500
I decided at the last minute<i>.</i>

36:57.583 --> 36:59.666
-I had no Internet.
-Sofia loved it.

37:02.708 --> 37:05.083
Apparently, you didn't. Wanna talk?

37:18.583 --> 37:20.291
I know you kissed Catarina.

37:25.291 --> 37:27.291
It meant nothing to me.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.541
She has nothing to do with me.

37:30.625 --> 37:32.083
We have something real.

37:33.000 --> 37:33.958
Look at me.

37:35.416 --> 37:37.916
-It's real.
-It doesn't seem like it.

37:38.541 --> 37:40.333
-What do you mean?
-It doesn't!

37:41.250 --> 37:44.250
Sofia just asked you
about your past, your family.

37:44.333 --> 37:45.958
I don't know who you are.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.916
The past is in the past.

37:52.625 --> 37:54.166
Let's live in the present.

37:54.875 --> 37:55.750
Please.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.000
I'd love to live in the present with you.

38:03.416 --> 38:06.750
But I have a daughter,
and I'll think about her future.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.625
You shouldn't sleep here today.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.500
You have a test tomorrow, right?

38:17.708 --> 38:18.625
Are you serious?

38:20.166 --> 38:21.000
I am.

38:52.708 --> 38:53.541
Good evening.

38:54.958 --> 38:58.333
-Did you forget something?
-We have an appointment.

38:58.416 --> 39:00.583
No, I'm waiting for the guy who--

39:02.250 --> 39:06.500
Exactly. I saw your post,
and I felt sorry for you.

39:08.000 --> 39:09.958
-Got it.
-Catarina, wait.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.125
I felt sorry

39:14.041 --> 39:17.458
'cause I know how you feel
when you buy something you like.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.416
That bothered me.

39:22.458 --> 39:26.000
So, I had the idea of buying everything.

39:27.375 --> 39:28.500
Rodrigo.

39:28.583 --> 39:31.666
And give it to you as a gift.

39:33.541 --> 39:34.625
Really?

39:34.708 --> 39:35.541
It's yours.

39:38.416 --> 39:39.291
Enjoy it.

40:30.250 --> 40:31.583
I wanted to thank You

40:32.083 --> 40:34.500
for the sign. I think I understood it.

40:43.291 --> 40:44.291
Please,

40:45.625 --> 40:47.916
give me strength to face everything.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.208
STAFF ONLY

42:27.666 --> 42:29.375
Hey, listen.

42:29.875 --> 42:31.208
Good news.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.541
I wanted you to be the first to know.

42:38.041 --> 42:40.625
Forget it. I'm coming to meet you.

42:40.708 --> 42:42.833
I'm telling you in person, okay?

42:53.125 --> 42:54.125
What's up?

43:05.708 --> 43:08.625
-I passed!
-You scared me!

43:08.708 --> 43:11.000
-Really? Congratulations!
-Yes!

43:17.416 --> 43:19.083
Thanks to your help.

43:20.375 --> 43:21.291
Thank you.

43:24.125 --> 43:25.083
It was nothing.

43:29.541 --> 43:31.666
Do you know when is the second test?

43:31.750 --> 43:33.208
No. Hold on.

43:36.708 --> 43:37.541
What?

43:38.041 --> 43:41.541
-February 25th.
-So? Do you have other plans?

43:43.416 --> 43:45.416
That's the day Danilo--

43:47.791 --> 43:49.458
That's when my brother died.
