(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:29.195 --> 00:32.240
I know exactly what happened
'cause it almost got my leg blown off.

00:32.323 --> 00:34.075
Tell me, briefly, exactly what happened.

00:34.242 --> 00:36.786
Those two fool teenagers
come running past me,

00:36.953 --> 00:39.414
then turn and almost shoot
directly at my leg.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.375
You knocked your leg
against this corner here.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.627
You would lie in church on Sunday.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.588
Now that was an execution.

00:46.921 --> 00:48.298
He knew that man,
and he was waiting for him.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.216
He shot him down and finished him off.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.385
Both those men were police officers,
Mr. Lewis.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.679
-Don't change nothing.
-MACKEY: We got two cops down.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.514
Szymanski's off duty,
gets shot in the shoulder

00:56.639 --> 00:58.224
coming out of that dry cleaner,

00:58.725 --> 01:01.603
shoots the other guy,
who's a street crime plainclothesman

01:01.686 --> 01:03.104
in the middle
of a foot pursuit with his partner.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.814
Who were the plainclothesmen chasing?

01:05.023 --> 01:06.941
Two kids with a gun.
They pulled a holdup three blocks down.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.026
They got away.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.695
The kids shot Szymanski
or the plainclothesmen did?

01:11.029 --> 01:13.239
The plainclothesman
that isn't wounded said,

01:13.364 --> 01:15.241
he nor his partner ever threw a shot,

01:15.742 --> 01:17.243
and the kids they were chasing
never turned around.

01:17.869 --> 01:19.245
What's the wounded
plainclothesman's name?

01:19.537 --> 01:21.456
Hudson.
And his partner's name's Donaldson.

01:23.458 --> 01:24.667
This could be some jackpot.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.170
Listen, don't push him,
but see can he tell you anything.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.006
(ANDY SIGHS)

01:32.342 --> 01:35.178
I'm on foot post.
I was actually down ways.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.097
They'll still probably
want to talk to you.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.974
Sure. It's just that I didn't see much.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.602
Yeah. Well, they just
want to touch all the bases.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.939
It's Andy Sipowicz, Szymanski.
What happened here?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.858
-Szymanski: This was not racial.
-Don't tell me what it wasn't.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.028
I didn't know he was a cop.
He shot me and I didn't know who he was.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.196
You're sure he shot first?

01:53.571 --> 01:56.491
I'm shot. I see him
pointing his gun at me. I returned fire.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.535
His partner says neither of them two shot.

01:58.618 --> 02:00.745
I'd just been shot.
The guy I shot was pointing his gun at me.

02:00.870 --> 02:01.913
What the hell was I supposed to do?

02:01.996 --> 02:04.249
All right. All right.
Calm down, Szymanski. Lower your voice.

02:04.457 --> 02:06.459
If it wasn't him, who the hell was it?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.212
The kid was on foot post.
He's worth a conversation.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.422
Says he didn't see anything, twice.

02:11.714 --> 02:12.715
Get yourself looked at.

02:12.841 --> 02:13.967
-We'll talk more at the house.
-Yeah.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.761
That guy swears the kids did the robbery
live in the Baruch projects.

02:17.387 --> 02:18.763
Them and ten thousand other people.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.058
Uh, he says he'd know 'em
if he saw 'em again.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.102
Anyways, we'll ride him over
and see what he comes up with.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.478
DIANE: Yeah, we'll go canvass.

02:25.895 --> 02:26.896
Hey, Andy.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.233
Possible complication.
Our boss has it in for this Szymanski.

02:30.775 --> 02:32.777
Over what?
What's the boss pissed off about?

02:34.070 --> 02:36.990
Getting stopped
for a busted taillight two years ago

02:37.365 --> 02:38.825
and the death of Martin Luther King.

02:44.122 --> 02:45.874
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:02.075 --> 04:05.203
-What do you know about it?
-My detectives haven't got back yet.

04:05.662 --> 04:06.663
You know it's Szymanski.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.624
Yeah. I know Szymanski's
one of the cops involved.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.836
Being he is, would you be more comfortable
I.A.B. coming in front on this one?

04:14.003 --> 04:14.921
No.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.006
I'm saying with your history
with this guy.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.592
And I'm saying I'm comfortable
running the investigation.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.807
-You check with the hospital?
-Szymanski's been treated and released.

04:26.224 --> 04:27.934
Andy and the crime guys
are bringing in him

04:28.142 --> 04:29.852
and the partner
of the plainclothes cop he shot.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.730
The plainclothes Szymanski shot
can't give us anything?

04:33.147 --> 04:34.857
No. He's just hanging on.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.238
If it is racial, this is a disaster.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.116
Szymanski put five in him.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.410
There's no way to pretty that up.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.122
Not that anyone would want to.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.083
I'll keep you up to speed.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.253
Like I said,
anytime you're more comfortable

04:55.378 --> 04:57.672
us getting in front,
that's all right, too.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.881
Yeah.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.967
I'm gonna handle it.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.977
-Just give us a second.
-Sure.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.230
-Just gotta talk to our boss.
-No problem.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.901
-How's it going?
-The better for seeing you.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.365
That's the rat squad.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.201
Yeah, they'd sometimes
have to do with us over in narcotics.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.454
Andy: Don't break balls.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.165
(SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

05:32.707 --> 05:33.833
They're bringing Szymanski

05:33.958 --> 05:35.543
and the shot undercover's
partner from Bellevue.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.046
That rookie cop was also on the scene.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.007
For a guy with nothing to tell us
he was hanging around pretty good.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.800
So, Andy, you'll talk to this rookie cop?

05:44.385 --> 05:45.386
No.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.639
Being Szymanski's the principal player,
I thought I'd talk with Szymanski.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.183
All right.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.019
-So I'll talk with this rookie cop Baker?
-Yeah, good.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.354
DANNY: Let me get him a soda.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.902
So when Szymanski gets here,
you mind if I sit in on your interview?

06:01.361 --> 06:02.445
Sit in meaning watch?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.198
Well, if I meant watch, Andy,
I would've said watch.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.951
So sit in means that you may want
to be asking questions?

06:09.535 --> 06:12.455
-If the spirit moves me, yeah.
-You do the interview.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.249
I didn't say I wanted to do the interview.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.709
No, you do the interview.

06:17.168 --> 06:19.587
'Cause I am not gonna have
someone sitting over me

"Did you screw this guy
to the wall hard enough

06:23.216 --> 06:25.468
"over shooting that innocent
black plainclothesman?"

06:33.851 --> 06:36.729
Szymanski,
talk to me here in the coffee room.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.400
-Talk to you?
-Yeah, talk to me.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.200
How you doing, Donaldson?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.495
How you doing?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.124
Sorry about your partner.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.335
He did me a solid once
when I was first cop on the scene.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.254
Yeah, that sounds like him.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.382
Sorry about your partner, too.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.058

balls at the academy?

07:14.600 --> 07:15.810
Mr. Clean?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.896
-Yeah, he's still teaching Martial arts.
-You guys called him Mr. Clean?

07:19.147 --> 07:21.524
Yeah, the shaved head,
looks exactly like that genie

07:21.607 --> 07:22.817
on the Mr. Clean bottles.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.611
Oh. When I was there
he still had like a bozo fringe.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.488
I guess he went total after I left.

07:29.198 --> 07:30.533
So what do you got for me, Neil?

07:32.201 --> 07:34.287
On the shooting incident,
I got nothing, you know?

07:35.746 --> 07:36.998
Just that it's a hell of a thing.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.334
-The plainclothes cop down?
-Yeah, the whole thing.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.838
You know, the off-duty cop
got one in the shoulder also.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.465
That Szymanski?

07:48.801 --> 07:50.720
All right, well, why don't you give me

07:50.803 --> 07:52.722
the nothing you got
for me in detail, Neil,

07:53.097 --> 07:54.682
so instead of spending the afternoon

07:54.849 --> 07:56.809
with my my pain in the balls
dinosaur partner

07:56.893 --> 07:59.270
pissing in my ear
I got inadequate information,

07:59.979 --> 08:02.148
I can spend it him
pissing in my ear I got too much.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.067
-That's that Sipowicz.
-Yeah, he's breaking me in.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.820
Giving me the advanced course in anxiety.

08:08.654 --> 08:12.533
One thing you want to avoid, Danny,
the one thing you want to avoid,

08:12.867 --> 08:15.745
do not make a mistake
your opening years on the job.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.290
A mistake coming up
will haunt you, your remaining career.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.251
So that's got me good and relaxed.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.504
Yeah, I know how that goes.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.299
I don't think you can do the job
looking over your own shoulder like that.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.009
I do what I think is right,

08:30.176 --> 08:32.845
and I'm not tying myself up
after with second-guessing.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.224
-Yeah, well.
-Yeah, well, what?

08:38.392 --> 08:40.478
Yeah, well, it's easy
not second guessing yourself

08:40.686 --> 08:44.315
if you haven't done anything wrong,
and making hypothetical statements.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.569
-Yeah, well, that's the point.
-Yeah.

08:53.324 --> 08:58.538
Although, if I did whatever I did
and my intentions were right,

08:59.455 --> 09:02.375
by me not second-guessing myself
or covering things up,

09:03.042 --> 09:04.794
I got a chance
of my intentions coming out.

09:05.294 --> 09:07.713
Those are seen,
and not just whatever I did.

09:07.838 --> 09:09.257
Yeah, well, what is it
you're trying to say?

09:09.674 --> 09:10.841
What are you driving at?

09:12.343 --> 09:14.679
I'm talking to another cop, Neil.
I'm not driving at nothing.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.432
I'm saying if another cop
told me something

09:18.516 --> 09:20.726
where some intention of his went wrong,

09:21.185 --> 09:23.104
I'm making damn sure his intentions

09:23.187 --> 09:25.648
cast a good strong light
on whatever it is he did,

09:25.773 --> 09:29.610
that didn't have the outcome he wanted.
I'm making damn sure of that.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.780
But first, I gotta know what happened.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.042
Well, maybe I got something to say.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.505
SZYMANSKI: I hear a shot outside.
I draw my gun.

09:50.047 --> 09:51.132
(SNIFFLES)

09:52.091 --> 09:54.510
My first step out,
a round hits me in the arm.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.389
Someone dressed like a bad guy
is pointing his gun at me.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.392
I defended myself.

10:02.518 --> 10:05.438
-What would you do?
-The guy dressed as a bad guy is Hudson.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.524
The plainclothes cop,
as I found out later.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.860
And you believed
it was Hudson who had fired on you.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.778
Riding over here, after the fact.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.948
His partner Donaldson
tells me Hudson didn't fire,

10:17.366 --> 10:20.661
-and he didn't fire either.
-And you shot Hudson five times.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.081
Somebody fired on me, Lieutenant,

10:24.999 --> 10:26.751
and it sure as hell,
looked like it was him.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.631
What was this, the phantom bullet?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.470
Me and Hudson
were on opposite sides of the street

10:37.553 --> 10:39.221
pursuing two robbery suspects.

10:39.847 --> 10:43.434
I'm looking ahead of me up the street.
I hear this gunshot over on Hudson's side.

10:43.643 --> 10:47.063
I see this guy. I don't know who he is,
this Szymanski.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.690
Now, he's holding a handgun
and he shoots Hudson,

10:49.940 --> 10:51.692
close range, a bunch of times.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.694
Neither you or Hudson
are wearing your vests at the time?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.655
Man, you know how uncomfortable
those things are.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.575
All right. So you see Hudson getting shot
a bunch of times

10:59.784 --> 11:01.285
while you're running
across the street to help him?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.996
I'm running across the street.
I'm shouting, "we're cops."

11:04.246 --> 11:05.873
(SCOFFS) Crazy as he looked,

11:06.624 --> 11:09.502
never occurred to me
this guy standing over Hudson,

11:09.627 --> 11:12.672
-this Szymanski, was a cop, too.
-Until he identified himself.

11:12.963 --> 11:15.883
Yeah. Until he identified himself,
it never occurred to me.

11:16.342 --> 11:20.554
So the other cops would know who you were,
you and your partner in plainclothes,

11:20.763 --> 11:23.766
I'm assuming that the both of you
were wearing the color of the day.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.352
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
-(PHONE RINGING)

11:30.356 --> 11:31.524
(SIGHS)

You with me, Donaldson?

11:34.985 --> 11:37.738
Color of the day for plainclothes,
were you wearing 'em?

11:38.864 --> 11:39.865
No, we were not.

11:44.620 --> 11:45.955
No, you were not.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.207
Sipowicz, you know as well as I do

11:48.374 --> 11:51.168
plainclothes don't wear the color
all the time so they don't get made.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.296
They put it on when trouble jumps off.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.757
And this that happened
in the street today,

11:57.007 --> 11:58.217
that don't count as trouble?

11:58.342 --> 12:01.220
It jumped off too quick.
The trouble happened too fast.

12:01.679 --> 12:04.432
Now, we were chasing bad guys.
We couldn't get the colors on.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.520
-You understand what happened?
-Yeah, I do.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.732
I'll be back with you in a minute.

12:18.779 --> 12:21.532
When the trouble starts,
him and the shot plainclothes

12:21.615 --> 12:22.658
aren't wearing the color of the day.

12:22.783 --> 12:25.703
How was Szymanski supposed to know
that these guys are cops?

12:26.620 --> 12:29.623
This Baker, Andy,
he says now he threw a shot in the street.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.208
From where?

12:31.417 --> 12:34.044
From the other side of these plainclothes,
from where Szymanski was.

12:35.087 --> 12:37.423
He says he thinks
it's his bullet hit Szymanski.

12:37.548 --> 12:39.842
If the bad guys are up the street
the other direction,

12:40.134 --> 12:41.677
who in the hell
is this rookie shooting at?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.013
Well, he didn't know about the bad guys
up the street, this Baker.

were the bad guys.

-Remains to be seen.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.775
How is this Szymanski
gettin' jammed, Andy?

12:56.525 --> 12:58.778
If these plainclothes weren't wearing
the color of the day,

12:59.111 --> 13:02.698
they got weapons drawn, and Szymanski
gets shot from their direction.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.742
Heat of the moment,
Szymanski's gotta believe

13:04.825 --> 13:06.035
they're the guys who shot him.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.828

13:48.577 --> 13:51.997
Szymanski insists they shot at him.
I want to make sure he's not right.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.625
-Plainclothes didn't shoot at him.
-And how do we know that?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.710
'Cause it's the one mistake
they didn't make.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.588
My guy threw the shot,
hit Szymanski's boss,

13:59.964 --> 14:01.131
this rookie cop, Baker.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.718
-And he admits that?
-Yeah, he admitted it to me.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.179
He thought the plainclothes
were the bad guys,

14:07.721 --> 14:10.015
throws a shot that hits Szymanski instead.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.060
This being behind the plainclothes
not wearing the color of the day,

14:13.185 --> 14:16.188
so neither this Baker
nor Szymanski know they were cops.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.857

made, too?

14:31.120 --> 14:32.746
No, I don't think
Andy's saying that, boss.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.250
No, I think we can put the five bullets
off Szymanski being shot

in front of him with a gun

as a cop while Szymanski

14:45.926 --> 14:47.761
poured round after round
after round in him.

14:47.887 --> 14:51.181
Yeah, well, maybe if he was wearing
a vest like he was supposed to do,

14:51.390 --> 14:53.934
Hudson'd be conscious now
so he could tell us that.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.605
You had Donaldson sitting in front of you.
Did you ask him what Szymanski looked like

14:57.771 --> 14:59.523
while he was putting five
in Hudson's belly?

14:59.690 --> 15:02.693
No, I didn't ask Donaldson
what Szymanski looked like.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.696
I didn't know that facial expressions
were possible felonies.

15:05.946 --> 15:09.491
Five bullets is a lot of bullets.
I'm interested in Szymanski's mind-set.

Hey, boss,
if you still need to hurt Szymanski,

15:12.745 --> 15:16.415
you better do it with a blunt instrument,

weren't wearing the color of the day.

that they weren't wearing something?

if those plainclothes were white,

27:20.347 --> 27:21.598
you would've thought twice.

I would've given them
a better chance at being on the job.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.770
Of course, then they wouldn't
have been as good at fitting in.

They should've been wearing the color.

I don't disagree.

As far as you putting five in Hudson.

27:35.695 --> 27:37.364
Lieutenant, five years ago,

27:37.572 --> 27:39.240
I was with my wife-to-be
out in Park Slope,

27:39.449 --> 27:41.284
and I got jumped and beaten
by three black kids.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.578
Once these three black kids
realized I was a cop,

27:43.703 --> 27:47.082

27:53.630 --> 27:55.340
was I looking to get back
at those three kids?

27:56.257 --> 27:59.969
And if I was, maybe that's how
this black plainclothes wound up shot,

28:00.136 --> 28:02.681
'cause pissing you off
got me transferred to this precinct

28:02.931 --> 28:04.933

over on Houston

28:05.183 --> 28:08.478
and putting me out on the street today
to shoot that black plainclothes cop.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.689

made me put five into him
