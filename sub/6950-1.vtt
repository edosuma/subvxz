MELVILLE:
How does one come to know the unknowable?

01:19.000 --> 01:21.890
"What faculties must a man possess?

01:22.040 --> 01:23.849
"Since it was discovered that whale oil

01:24.000 --> 01:27.322
"could light our cities
in ways never achieved before,

01:27.520 --> 01:29.602
"it created global demand.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.329
"It has pushed man to venture
further and further

01:33.480 --> 01:36.529
"into the deep blue unknown.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.603
"We know not its depths,

01:38.760 --> 01:41.650
"nor the host of creatures
that live there.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.370
"Monsters.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.681
"Are they real?

01:55.640 --> 01:59.531
"Or do the stories exist only to make us
respect the sea's dark secrets?

02:13.360 --> 02:15.931
"The question both vexes and excites me

02:16.080 --> 02:19.724
"and is the reason I've written you
a second time to request a meeting.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.128
"A conversation with you, sir,
I believe will serve me well

02:22.280 --> 02:23.884
"for the novel I intend to write,

02:24.400 --> 02:27.085
"currently entitled Moby Dick.

02:28.320 --> 02:31.005
"I hope you will reconsider my offer.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.327
"The unknown.

02:34.480 --> 02:37.006
"That is where my imagination
yearns to venture.

02:38.880 --> 02:41.360
"And so the question plagues me still.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.844
"How does a man come to know

"Sincerely, Herman Melville."

We're closed.

02:51.760 --> 02:53.250
No boarders after 8:00.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.931
You came.

03:06.760 --> 03:08.046
(DOOR OPENS)

03:14.920 --> 03:17.446
Someone here for you, my love.

03:17.600 --> 03:18.806
Tom Nickerson?

03:21.960 --> 03:23.291
Herman Melville.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.809
We received your letter.

03:26.640 --> 03:30.880
You're either a desperate man or a fool
to come all the way to Nantucket.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.531
Well, my offer still stands.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.528
Three months' lodgings
for a single night's talk.

03:40.800 --> 03:42.564
All I have in the world.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.961
But I prefer to think of it
as an investment.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.841
I want you to tell me
what happened to the Essex.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.081
(SIGHS) What do you think happened?

03:59.760 --> 04:02.650
There are rumblings.
Rumors that the Essex was...

04:02.840 --> 04:03.887
What do you want?

04:04.040 --> 04:06.008
What story do you expect to hear?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.605
That of the whale.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.326
The Essex ran aground.
There was a full inquiry.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.286
I believe the inquiry
was less than truthful.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.166
Get out.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.845
You are the last survivor
of the Essex, sir.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.604
If you won't talk, who will?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.685
Did you not hear me? Leave. Now.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.970
(DOOR CLOSES)

04:34.280 --> 04:36.601
- No. You mustn't go. Please.
- He is in no mind to talk.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.331
And I haven't come all this way
to be humiliated and waste my time.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.482
Please, Mr. Melville.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.889
He won't talk about the Essex to me.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.771
To anyone. Never has. Never.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.602
There's an agony about him.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.804
His soul is in torment,

04:55.960 --> 04:58.201
and in need of confession.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.089
Please, just let me talk to him.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.480
Please.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.247
Love.

05:13.760 --> 05:17.048
I believe it would do you good
to talk to the man.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.281
No.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.769
You listen well.

05:25.720 --> 05:29.008
Who holds this place together
while you drink yourself to death?

05:29.800 --> 05:34.882
You will talk with this man as much
as is necessary to keep the money.

05:36.440 --> 05:38.807
You know our circumstances, Thomas.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.123
Only as much as is necessary.

05:57.600 --> 05:59.250
I'll get whiskey.

06:04.960 --> 06:09.688
MELVILLE: I neglected to mention it
in my letter, but I was a whaler once.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.808
One trip, I mean.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.641
Green hand.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.848
So, you've seen it all.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.804
My wife read your books.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.969
She enjoyed them.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.284
I'm happy to hear it.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.048
I've had good sales.

06:29.240 --> 06:32.210
And I think this story
could surpass the success

06:32.360 --> 06:34.806
of even my first novel,
which did quite well.

06:35.320 --> 06:38.324
Another of your seafaring yarns?

06:42.240 --> 06:44.208
Have you read Hawthorne, Mr. Melville?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.409
Now there's a writer.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.010
Great writer.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.366
He is.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.690
But he is not here. And I am.

06:57.760 --> 06:59.125
For my own particular reasons.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.809
I will tell you of the Essex.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.564
I believe you will be disappointed.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.646
But every word I say will be true.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.245
Story of the Essex
is the story of two men.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.891
Captain George Pollard and his first mate,

07:28.560 --> 07:29.925
Owen Chase.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.728
- Owen. You don't wanna be late.
- (HAMMERING)

07:33.280 --> 07:34.645
I'll be there.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.724
Besides, can't have our daughter
sleeping under a leaky roof, can we?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.082
What makes you so sure it's a girl?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.126
Well, it has to be.

07:42.280 --> 07:45.563
So she can remind me why I still
love you when you're being stubborn.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.691
Well, if it's to be a daughter,
she'll be a version of you, not me.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.730
Blond locks and determined
to conquer the world.

07:51.880 --> 07:55.130
I suppose after today, you'll be
trading in that tunic for a uniform.

07:55.280 --> 07:56.406
That's right.

07:56.560 --> 07:59.925
Finally out of this patch of dirt,
into a captain's house like you deserve.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.609
PEGGY: I don't need one of those houses
in town with stuffy neighbors.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.171
There's plenty of room here
for the three of us.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.488
You know, sometimes your kind heart
and good nature is just unbearable.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.328
Go get your captaincy.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.769

09:32.640 --> 09:34.642
- Good morning, Mr. Chase.
- Mr. Mason.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.251
Come in, please.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.481

09:38.080 --> 09:40.128
My partner, Benjamin Fuller.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.406
CHASE: Good morning, sir.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.170
Do sit down.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.084
Mr. Chase.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.686
I do hope you realize how satisfied we are

09:51.840 --> 09:53.683
with the work you've done for us
over the years.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.569
Thank you, sir.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.927
Now, one of our ships, the Essex,

09:58.080 --> 10:02.202
has just been refitted at great expense
and is to go to sea.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.928
Now, having made
such an investment in her,

10:05.120 --> 10:08.681
we want to be sure
she's in the best possible hands.

10:08.840 --> 10:13.687
So, it gives us great pleasure
to offer you a position aboard her.

10:14.640 --> 10:16.529
As first mate.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.281
As first mate?

10:20.560 --> 10:21.561
Mmm-hmm.

10:22.360 --> 10:25.762
Mr. Mason, you promised me
command of a ship after my last voyage

10:25.920 --> 10:28.207
when I brought you back 1,500 barrels.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.044
Do you remember? You gave me your word.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.725
That promise must now be deferred.

10:33.880 --> 10:36.804
Like everyone else,
we've had a lean time recently.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.086
No, never on my watch.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.045
Nantucket now dominates the world market.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.808
That must not change.

10:43.960 --> 10:46.611
This is no time for experimentation.

10:47.400 --> 10:50.483
The Essex will be captained
by George Pollard,

10:51.080 --> 10:53.731
scion of a great whaling family.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.569
His father also happens to be ourpatron.

10:57.760 --> 10:59.000
MASON: Blood, Mr. Chase.

10:59.160 --> 11:01.686
You can have all the voyages
under your belt you want,

11:01.840 --> 11:03.490
but blood will always win out.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.650
Yes, well, blood is not gonna fill
a ship with oil, Mr. Mason.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.370
To successfully command,
a captain needs respect.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.250
Now, what if the men don't respect him?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.729
You will make sure that they do.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.048
Ah, good day, gentlemen.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.641
MASON: I understand your disappointment,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.007
so, a one-fifteenth lay.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.371
That's more than
I've ever paid any first officer.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.646
And if you bring back
2,000 barrels of oil,

11:29.800 --> 11:31.768
I give you my word,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.325
next time, you will have your captaincy.

11:35.480 --> 11:38.211
You've given me
your word before, Mr. Mason.

11:40.440 --> 11:42.283
No, this time, I'll take it in writing.

11:47.080 --> 11:48.127
(DOOR CLOSES)

11:55.800 --> 11:57.529
Captain Pollard.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.483
We've just had a most
agreeable conversation with Mr. Chase.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.166
He'll be honored to serve under you.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.844
I'm glad to hear it.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.523
Now I'm to babysit a greenhorn.

12:10.120 --> 12:13.921
Some chinless Nantucketer born
with a damn silver spoon in his mouth.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.208
You know, I should've thrown
the offer back in their faces.

12:16.360 --> 12:19.807
Why? You now have
the offer of command in writing.

12:19.960 --> 12:23.765
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless,
even on paper.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.971
You know, I'd love you just as much
if you were a merchant captain.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.603
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.000
I won't be gone two years.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.842
A Bedford whaler came back
last week who was gone three.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.480
She lost two men
and still with her hull half empty.

12:46.640 --> 12:49.206
Yeah, well, they were from Bedford,
and they didn't have me on board.

12:54.360 --> 12:55.930
Son of a bitch!

12:58.600 --> 13:00.364
I will captain my own ship!

13:02.240 --> 13:03.730
A whaling ship.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.881
Up to them, all we'd ever have
is this patch of dirt,

13:07.040 --> 13:08.405
and that's not gonna happen, Peggy.

13:08.760 --> 13:10.364
Those are your father's words, not yours.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.524
What's wrong with his words?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.324
He wanted things
for his family, for himself.

13:16.680 --> 13:17.841
He was a dreamer, Owen.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.889
Yes, he was.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.325
Dreamed of the sea and never got
to sail it because of men like them.

13:23.680 --> 13:25.489
At least he got to see his children born.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.010
It's all I know.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.290
I'm sorry.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.365
I married a whaleman.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.926
Hey.

13:55.720 --> 13:58.451
I'll come back as quick
as a summer's night, I swear.

14:09.360 --> 14:10.885
Just come back.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.286
Promise me.

14:15.560 --> 14:18.450
I already swore to you.
Now you want me to promise, too?

14:23.080 --> 14:24.605
I promise.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.849
POLLARD SR.: Son, a word with you.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.171
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend.

14:46.360 --> 14:47.486
You are their superior.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.601
Never forget that.
Never let them forget that.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.966
Thank you, sir.

14:53.160 --> 14:57.006
Your great-grandfather and a few others
created this industry.

14:57.720 --> 15:01.566
Without us, without you,
the world plunges into darkness.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.004
I hope to bring honor to
the Pollard family name, sir.

O Father, grant that your glorious light

15:46.280 --> 15:49.443
Ensure them a prosperous voyage,

15:49.600 --> 15:52.888
that they may return safely
and with a full ship,

15:53.640 --> 15:57.201
so that the white flames
of Nantucket whale oil

15:57.360 --> 16:00.204

that drive our great nation forward

16:10.160 --> 16:13.607
as our noble species evolves.

16:13.760 --> 16:16.570
In your name, we pray.

16:25.080 --> 16:29.290
- So, what month was this?
- Late in the year.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.326
We were one of the last ships to go out,

16:32.480 --> 16:34.562

Barzillai and I got a berth.

Scared, but more scared to show it.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.770
Barzillai was 17.

They're whale pins, Thomas.

17:04.160 --> 17:06.288
How do I get one of them?

17:06.440 --> 17:08.488
Well, you gotta thrust the killing lance

Well, well, you being on board
means only one thing.

17:30.800 --> 17:34.131
Yeah, at least there's one person on this
ship who knows the truth about Owen Chase.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.682
No, that all the other ships
have already crewed up.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.206
Now, now.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.646
I'm a reformed man, Owen.

- Dry as sand.

Ah, serene as the church.

17:50.040 --> 17:52.486
I'll believe that when I see it.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.642
And given our captain,

17:54.840 --> 17:58.162
I'll give your serenity about 48 hours?

That's an off-island name, isn't it?

18:13.800 --> 18:15.165
Yes, it is.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.840
And very shortly, we will be
off-island for some time,

18:18.000 --> 18:19.365
and I'll be very much at home.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.728

33:39.000 --> 33:42.206
You will then apologize to them
for interfering with a captain's order,

33:42.360 --> 33:44.761
which nearly cost the lives
of every man on this ship today.

33:45.120 --> 33:46.121

- It was your order to set stunsails, sir.
- That decision was sound.

So you send them into a storm?

33:57.720 --> 33:59.165
That was unlucky.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.368
No, it was bad seamanship.

is just plain weakness.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.888
Do you know who you're speaking to?

34:08.040 --> 34:10.646
My name is Captain George Pollard.

34:10.800 --> 34:11.801
Pollard!

And you, Mr. Chase,
no matter how many whale pins

34:17.800 --> 34:21.244
you may have on your lapel,
are nothing more than the son of a farmer

34:21.639 --> 34:24.688
who's managed to bully his way
into an officer's tunic.

34:26.440 --> 34:27.771
Now get out.

34:31.199 --> 34:35.364
To return to port without a single
barrel of oil would be a mistake, sir.

34:36.159 --> 34:38.561
And not behoove a man
whose name is Pollard.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.849
Or Chase, for that matter.

34:41.480 --> 34:45.571
And the best thing for both of us
would be to work all hours God sends us,

34:45.719 --> 34:48.485
fill this ship with oil
and be home inside a year

34:48.639 --> 34:50.688
and rid of one another
as quickly as possible.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.851
Trust me, I am every bit
as desirous of that as you.

will tolerate each other, Mr. Melville.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.204
But an ill-married couple
can also bring down a ship.

35:24.760 --> 35:26.000
Are you married, Mr. Melville?

the Essex did not return to port.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.647

- She continued out to sea.
- Yes, she did.

44:59.960 --> 45:01.041

45:01.960 --> 45:04.327
Well, that's where the treasure is.

45:15.400 --> 45:17.641

45:17.800 --> 45:19.131
That they had.

45:20.040 --> 45:22.646
So, we headed further out.

45:25.320 --> 45:26.526
Yeah.

Our hold was almost empty.

46:11.560 --> 46:14.530
And to gaze upon our paltry efforts

46:14.680 --> 46:16.842

A thousand leagues along the equator.

50:00.760 --> 50:04.401
Where knowledge ended, speculation began.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.849

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.089
We're nothing. We're...

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.561
We're specks. And dust.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.928
We sail into the sun at dawn.

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:16.402
If we are to die,
then with God's grace, let us die as men.

Mr. Wright?

I can't do it, sir.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:45.730
Me, Wrights and Weeks,

01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.160
we're staying.

CHASE: You ready to go, Matthew?

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:10.920
I'll give you a hand.
Here, you gotta get up.

01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:12.491
No, there's no point. You hear me?

01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:14.483
No, we're going home. We're going home.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.971
There's no point.

01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:18.490
- Just go.

It's all right.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.841
Well, I'll send a boat for you
the minute we get back.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.361
Then we'll play cards
back in Nantucket, all right?

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.766
Yeah.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:37.644
- It's a deal.
- Good.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:46.811
You want me to open that for you?

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.171
I think I'll manage.

If it comes to that.

01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:00.249
God be with you, brother.

MR. BOND: Brother Peterson?

Why don't you come in our boat

Mr. Lawrence. Mr. Lawrence, wake up.

Look at me, Benjamin.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:12.286
No right-minded sailor discards
what might yet save him.

01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.883
So it was decided.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.724
We prepared the body.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.768
We removed the organs.

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:21.251
Separated his limbs from his body

01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.491
and cut all the flesh from the bones.

01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.246
After which,

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:34.164
we closed the body

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.721
and we sewed it up

01:28:37.720 --> 01:28:39.722
as decently as we could

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.561
and committed it to the sea.

01:28:44.640 --> 01:28:46.449

It is out.

01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.204
And you've never told anyone?

01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:22.807
No.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.806
Not even your wife?

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:29.521
Do you think she could ever love me

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.809
if she knew the abominations
I had committed?

01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.883
MRS. NICKERSON: Yes. She would.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:39.802
And if you had told me
the story when we met,

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:43.330
I would still wear your ring today.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.048
The strength of that boy

was that everyone would die,

we were still 800 miles from land.

They looked after us as best they could

till we found a ship
that would carry us home.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.243
That voyage took another three months.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:04.003
It looked like the whole island
turned out to see us return.

01:41:05.400 --> 01:41:07.129
But there were no cheers.

01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.446
Only silence.

we were apparitions,

knew of our privations.

when he was stopped and
made to return to the Maritime office.

There were business matters
still in question.

So, to the matter.

And as captain and first mate,
we will be expected to give an account

01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:57.646
of what happened.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.086
Yes, of course.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:03.643
And having discussed this
with the ship owners and my father,

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:08.526
it is clear that full disclosure
will have ramifications.

01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.487
Terrible ramifications
for the whole industry.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.161
That a whale brought down the Essex.

01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.806
But it's the truth.

01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.962
If the insurance houses and investors

01:44:28.120 --> 01:44:32.967
were to start worrying
about sea monsters sinking ships,

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:35.367
sailors drawing lots to survive...

01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.690
We are in the oil business.

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:40.646
All of us.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.486
And as in any business,

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:46.201
the probability of success must
always be greater than the risk incurred.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.808
So, what are you suggesting, George?

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.049
That you say the ship ran aground.

01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:55.201
That's a lie.

01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:58.569
- And that the men that died, drowned.
- And that's another lie.

01:44:58.840 --> 01:45:00.126
Think on it. They will make you captain.

01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.408
Well, that pledge I already have
in writing.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:06.042
Only on the condition
you bring home a ship full of oil.

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.286
This way, it's guaranteed.

01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:11.449
FULLER: You would be a wealthy man.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.965
The name Chase need
no longer be a landsman's name,

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:16.407
but an established name

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:19.291
that belongs among the great families
of Nantucket.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:22.961
You want me to whitewash
what happened for profit?

01:45:23.920 --> 01:45:26.685
We are asking you to be pragmatic.

01:45:42.680 --> 01:45:44.762
The Essex was stove by a white whale.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.924
And those of us that survived
in ill-equipped whaleboats

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.050
had to commit abominations
in order to survive.

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:56.967
And, on our return,
we're expected to spread barefaced lies

01:45:58.120 --> 01:46:00.248
so that you, the ship owners of Nantucket,

01:46:01.280 --> 01:46:04.204
might line your pockets
and sleep well at night?

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.442
Well, I will not embroider the truth.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.449
Nor should you, George.

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:32.327
NICKERSON: That last time I saw him...

01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:33.720
Mr. Chase, sir!

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.245
I couldn't find the right words
to say what I wanted to.

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.321
Thomas.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:42.449
NICKERSON: Perhaps there are no words.

01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:43.807
Um...

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:48.487
I'm gonna be on my way to Falmouth and...

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.406
It's...

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.961
It's been an honor, sir, to sail with you.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:03.042
The honor's been mine, Mr. Nickerson.

01:47:20.320 --> 01:47:21.367
Here.

01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:28.565
Good luck out there, Thomas.

01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:31.520
And you, sir.

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:03.530
Next day, George Pollard was called
before the inquiry.

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.322
(CROWD MURMURING)

01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:09.965
MASON: Gentlemen, Captain George Pollard.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.203
NICKERSON: And all the important men
in Nantucket were there.

01:48:14.920 --> 01:48:16.524
It was a formality.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.844
Good day to you, Captain. Please sit down.

01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:27.125
For the record, then...

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:34.607
The Essex was stove by a white whale
1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.885
It was as if Owen Chase himself
had spoken.

01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:41.285
Told them the truth.

01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:47.568
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.286
But the inquiry was a sham.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:54.201
Pollard went out again,

01:48:57.560 --> 01:48:59.164
looking for the white whale.

01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:01.120
He never found it.

01:49:02.880 --> 01:49:05.042
He ran a second ship aground off Hawaii.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:07.800
Twice cursed.

01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:10.687
Never sailed again.

01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:12.321
And Owen Chase?

01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.009
He was a man of his word.

01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.127
First, he sent a boat back
to Ducie Island.

01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:22.051
Mr. Joy had passed.

01:49:22.760 --> 01:49:25.969
But the other three were,
incredibly, still alive.

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.206
And then?

01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.488
And then he packed up his family
and moved to New Bedford.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.005
Started over.

01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:40.251
Became a merchant captain,

01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:43.162
sailing on his own terms.

01:49:52.680 --> 01:49:55.729
Well, you certainly got your
money's worth, Mr. Melville.

01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.760
These February nights
are the longest of the year.

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:00.843
Well, you can both rest now.

01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:02.411
Believe me,

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:04.688
I shall not be resting for some time.

01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.686
NICKERSON: Why?

01:50:07.680 --> 01:50:09.284
You got your story.

01:50:09.840 --> 01:50:12.366
You know, your plot. It's all there.

01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.162
Maybe it wasn't a plot I was after.

01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.530
No. What, then?

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.842
- Something else you've given me tonight.
- And what's that?

01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:27.811
The courage to go where
one does not want to go.

01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.405
Mr. Melville,

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.566
what you've heard, what I've told you,

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.725
will it all be of service to your book?

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:46.483
It will be a work of fiction,
Mr. Nickerson,

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.450
inspired by truth.

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.243
But I don't believe
I'll feel the need to use all of it.

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:05.289
- Thank you.
- Here.

01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:08.762
- Take that with you.
- No. The money is for you. I insist.

01:51:09.920 --> 01:51:11.604
I insist you keep it.

01:51:11.760 --> 01:51:15.526
And I insist one person
in this conversation is sober.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:29.091
- So it's back to, uh...
- Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.490
Well, good luck.

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.441
Thank you.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:39.286
You know,

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:43.528
I heard a man from Pennsylvania
drilled a hole in the ground recently

01:51:44.600 --> 01:51:46.125
and found oil.

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:47.966
That can't be true.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:49.921
I heard it, too.

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.124
Oil from the ground.

01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:57.891
Fancy that.

02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:41.161
