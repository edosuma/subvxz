00:51.342 --> 00:52.218
Are you done?

00:52.927 --> 00:55.764
No, I'm not done.
I haven't even taken off...

01:01.478 --> 01:02.687
Tell me when you're done.

01:08.693 --> 01:10.153
<i>What is this situation?</i>

01:14.741 --> 01:16.159
<i>This is like...</i>

01:16.993 --> 01:18.787
<i>going to an island together</i>

01:19.287 --> 01:20.997
<i>and missing the last ferry back.</i>

01:29.297 --> 01:31.132
<i>But there's only one room.</i>

01:32.258 --> 01:33.468
<i>Isn't this what it's like?</i>

01:40.308 --> 01:42.685
<i>I must be going crazy.</i>
<i>What am I thinking?</i>

01:47.398 --> 01:49.025
Turn around in 20 minutes.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.070
-What?
-Stay still for 20 minutes.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.989
-Hey!
-Is this a punishment or what?

01:55.406 --> 01:56.783
-Why should I?
-10 minutes, then.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.535
BASED ON THE WEBCOMIC
<i>MY ID IS GANGNAM BEAUTY </i>BY KI MAENG-GI

01:58.618 --> 02:01.371
I don't want you to know exactly
when I changed.

02:04.582 --> 02:05.708
Turn around.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.669
-I'll give you 20 seconds.
-What?

02:09.002 --> 02:10.964
-Hey.
-Start.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.723
By the way, how will you know
when 20 seconds are up?

02:21.307 --> 02:22.267
12.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.227
13.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.855
14.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.107
15.

02:31.234 --> 02:32.152
16.

02:33.945 --> 02:34.779
17.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.365
18.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.493
19.

02:45.915 --> 02:46.749
20.

03:06.978 --> 03:08.605
I'm done.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.837
You're wearing it backwards.

03:32.921 --> 03:33.922
What?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.013
I'll give 30 seconds.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.309
Hey, don't do that.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.104
Just don't turn around
until I tell you that I'm done.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.575
Will you leave without watching it?

04:03.117 --> 04:04.577
You can stay and watch it.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.248
Why are you suddenly in a bad mood?

04:09.749 --> 04:11.709
I'm not. I'm just tired.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.462
Sua.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.007
Why did you only call Sua?
Ji-hyo is here too.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.677
Hi, Ji-hyo.

04:20.760 --> 04:21.928
No need to call my name.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.764
Are you not going to watch
the performance?

04:24.847 --> 04:26.557
I want to leave because I'm tired.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.269
Already?
You should stay for a little longer.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.732
Hey, he's been looking for you
all day long.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.943
At least take a photo with him.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.570
-Hey.
-Just be quiet, okay?

04:40.029 --> 04:41.155
Let's take a photo.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.619
Oh, my goodness. It's your lucky day, man.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.622
Then... go stand over there, will you?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.874
A little further back.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.715
Oh, my. What nice scenery.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.300
-Ji-hyo.
-Yes?

05:00.383 --> 05:01.801
-Get out.
-Me?

05:01.884 --> 05:03.011
Yes, get out.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.308
Sua, you look so pretty. This is great.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.059
Won-ho, smile.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.689
All right, I'm going to take it now.
1, 2...

05:14.772 --> 05:16.357
-Hey!
-Hold on! Just a second.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.151
Let's take it together.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.863
-What is this about? Gosh!
-Can't we be in this photo?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.365
All right. You can eat this. Here.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.576
-Let's take it.
-She wants us in the photo.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.119
Send the photo to us too.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.579
Sure, no problem.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.039
Here we go.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.125
One, two, three.

05:36.085 --> 05:37.337
-Another one?
-Yes.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.671
Okay, sure.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.798
All right. Here we go!

05:42.508 --> 05:43.968
-Perfect.
-Is it perfect?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.386
-It's perfect.
-You're always so serious.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.721
KYUNG-SEOK, PLEASE JOIN
THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN

05:46.804 --> 05:48.473
-Have fun, guys.
-Okay.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.642
-Did you finish it?
-Was it not good?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.527
You were...

06:02.570 --> 06:03.654
cool yesterday.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.866
What you did to Trash.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.537
What's cool about it?

06:12.455 --> 06:14.332
Everyone found out my nickname.

06:16.584 --> 06:19.337
It wasn't a surprise to you
since you already knew.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.254
I didn't know.

06:21.798 --> 06:22.632
What?

06:24.258 --> 06:25.593
That nickname of yours.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.053
I didn't know.

06:29.555 --> 06:31.933
You didn't know what everyone else knew?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.103
Was I an outcast?

06:39.148 --> 06:42.610
Nobody made you an outcast.
You probably wanted to be alone.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.695
Everyone wanted to be friends with you.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.864
With me? Why?

06:46.948 --> 06:48.241
Because I'm handsome?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.120
If you...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.164
hadn't gotten the wrong idea,

06:56.165 --> 06:57.792
could we have been friends?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.304
You'd never have wanted...

07:11.514 --> 07:12.849
to be friends with me.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.562
There were many pretty girls.

07:22.024 --> 07:23.359
Looks aren't everything.

07:25.778 --> 07:26.821
I don't like...

07:29.198 --> 07:30.491
pretty girls.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.333
So are you saying...

07:42.170 --> 07:44.422
I'm ugly?

07:47.008 --> 07:49.343
Well, you're funny.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.805
Do you think I'm funny because I'm ugly?

07:54.390 --> 07:55.224
No.

07:56.517 --> 07:59.687
I just thought
your dance on the bench was funny.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.358
I liked that you were funny.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.120
Let's head inside.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.511
Hey!

08:32.220 --> 08:33.304
Were you here together?

08:34.429 --> 08:35.306
Yes.

08:35.389 --> 08:38.601
What are you guys doing here?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.895
I came here to get changed.

08:40.977 --> 08:41.854
What?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.566
Thank you.

08:47.902 --> 08:48.778
Thanks.

08:52.323 --> 08:53.908
She came to get changed?

08:57.453 --> 08:59.080
I guess I'm no longer a loner.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.791
I have a friend now.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.084
What?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.169
I have you.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.926
<i>I never had a guy friend before.</i>

09:14.053 --> 09:15.930
<i>I can't believe I'm friends with him.</i>

09:22.353 --> 09:23.604
That's so pretty.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.323
In one, two, three.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.065
You should go now.
You don't need to walk me home.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.233
It's not like I shouldn't.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.489
My bus is here.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.492
I'll go now. See you.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.391
I have a friend now.

11:23.474 --> 11:24.684
What?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.019
I have you.

11:37.321 --> 11:38.656
BUS 7010 ROUTE

11:42.868 --> 11:44.328
Sir.

11:54.755 --> 11:55.631
Sua.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.592
Look at this.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.928
He's Kyung-seok's dad.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.398
CANDIDATE DO SANG-WON GOES
CAMPAIGNING FOR VOTES

12:16.652 --> 12:18.279
HIS EX-WIFE IS NA HYE-SUNG,
THE CEO OF KELUN KOREA,

12:18.362 --> 12:20.239
AND THE TWO GOT DIVORCED TEN YEARS AGO.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.340
What are you doing?

12:38.674 --> 12:42.470
Kyung-hee came in 23rd out of 26 students.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.475
The other three didn't take the test,
and don't come to school.

13:11.165 --> 13:13.375
I know I did something wrong,

13:14.752 --> 13:16.212
but this is just too much.

13:17.004 --> 13:18.214
What did you do wrong?

13:20.883 --> 13:22.760
Getting bad grades isn't a bad thing.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.513
Right?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.322
<i>Kyung-seok, stop crying right now.</i>

13:43.405 --> 13:45.407
A man shouldn't cry over
something petty.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.202
What's wrong with you?

13:48.285 --> 13:50.704
The least you could do is
try to console him.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.792
Guys need to have a strong mindset.
Why do you cry so easily?

13:54.875 --> 13:58.337
Gender has nothing to do with crying.
He can cry if he feels upset.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.216
I gave him everything he wanted,
and now he's just weak.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.806
Don't even think about coming inside.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.850
He's so mean.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.270
-Dad's so mean.
-Why did you cry?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.397
Did something upset you?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.023
Yes.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.400
It's okay.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.199
Guys can cry if they want to.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.451
That doesn't mean you're weak.

14:30.619 --> 14:32.329
That's not what Dad says.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.331
A true strong person is...

14:34.915 --> 14:39.253
someone who tries not to hurt the people
who are weaker than them.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.215
Kyung-seok, you're healthy

14:43.382 --> 14:46.552
and very handsome.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.596
So you'll have to be extra careful.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.367
-According to the freshmen...
-Yes?

15:10.576 --> 15:13.037
...Kyung-seok's
dad used to be a congressman.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.164
-Really?
-Yes.

15:16.040 --> 15:16.916
Who?

15:17.875 --> 15:19.501
His name was Do something.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.463
Well, of course, his last name is Do.

15:23.839 --> 15:25.257
-Gosh.
-Do...

15:25.466 --> 15:26.467
What was his name?

15:27.468 --> 15:28.844
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.012
-Really?
-Yes.

15:30.095 --> 15:34.266
Gosh, if my mom was the CEO of Kelun,
I would've beaten Chan-woo up as well.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.768
Chan-woo must've known.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.312
Otherwise,
he wouldn't have let him get away.

15:38.395 --> 15:41.982
But I haven't seen him around
for a really long time.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.901
You're the one who should know.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.111
-What do you mean?
-He's your best friend.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.614
-What are you saying?
-You didn't have to hit me.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.804
FROM: DAD
DON'T SKIP YOUR MEALS.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.812
<i>I'll visit you on Saturday.</i>

16:21.814 --> 16:24.733
-His dad used to be a congressman.
-Really?

16:25.192 --> 16:26.193
The perfume company.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.196
-I use their perfume.
-I love their products.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.163
<i>They're probably talking about me.</i>

16:48.298 --> 16:50.342
His mom's the CEO of Kelun.

16:51.010 --> 16:51.885
He's really rich.

16:51.969 --> 16:54.304
-My gosh.
-He comes from a great family.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.433
I heard his parents got divorced.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.018
No wonder he's so cold.

16:59.101 --> 16:59.935
Hey, Sua.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.687
-Hi.
-Hey.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.522
He's so good-looking.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.608
-He really is.
-He's so handsome.

17:08.902 --> 17:09.737
Hey, Mi-rae.

17:10.863 --> 17:11.821
Hey.

17:11.905 --> 17:16.660
Kyung-seok's dad is a congressman
and his mom's the CEO of Kelun.

17:16.743 --> 17:17.994
-Really? Who?
-Yes.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.204
He's from a rich family.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.790
No wonder he's so rude.

17:22.207 --> 17:23.250
-I get it now.
-Yes.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.585
He lacks nothing.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.088
Did you tell everyone?

17:28.922 --> 17:29.757
Well...

17:35.971 --> 17:36.889
Hey.

17:48.734 --> 17:49.651
Give me his phone.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.540
You dropped this yesterday.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.881
You're coming to the after-party?

18:13.425 --> 18:14.676
You really are the worst.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.428
What?

18:26.939 --> 18:27.940
Hello.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.275
-Hello.
-Hello.

18:32.569 --> 18:36.406
Let's talk about the assignment
you must submit before the final exam.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.621
Watch one of the movies
that are currently playing at theaters

18:43.288 --> 18:45.332
and submit your report on that movie.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.460
There isn't any format or guideline, okay?

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
-Yes, professor.
-Yes, ma'am.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.759
Hey, let's go watch a movie together.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.597
Did you get shot in the head?

19:03.225 --> 19:04.309
Bang, bang.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.521
Kyung-seok.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.024
Are you going to the after-party?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.025
What about you?

19:12.109 --> 19:13.652
I think I'm going.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.530
I'll think about it.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.740
Okay.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.288
-You took the wrong bus, didn't you?
-No.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.958
I had to go somewhere yesterday.

19:36.967 --> 19:37.843
Hello, Woo-young.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.460
You're here.

20:12.502 --> 20:13.503
Hello.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.464
-Come sit here.
-Okay.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.765
Why did you want to see me?

20:24.848 --> 20:27.976
I have to visit the office of Kelun Korea
regarding our partnership.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.811
The director wants you to come.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.313
Me?

20:31.396 --> 20:34.858
She wants to know
how you made the candles.

20:35.108 --> 20:36.318
Seems like you did a great job.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.654
Well...

20:39.071 --> 20:40.989
How about today?
Any plan after school?

20:41.073 --> 20:43.784
We're having the festival after-party.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.790
I think I can go there late
after visiting the office with you.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.416
-Really?
-Yes.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.710
-Then I'll see you later.
-Okay.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.254
Mi-rae.

20:57.798 --> 20:58.966
How do you do this?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.094
Wait, that's...

21:02.844 --> 21:07.099
I can follow the choreography
except for this part.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.684
Can you teach me how to do it?

21:10.394 --> 21:12.187
-Well...
-Well, later.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.772
-See you later.
-Okay, bye.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.360
You came early.

21:18.443 --> 21:21.488
I have no part-time work today,
so I came to help you.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.282
Thank you.

21:36.086 --> 21:38.547
By the way, aren't you hiring
any part-timers?

21:42.551 --> 21:43.385
What is it?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.096
-None of them are pretty?
-That's not it.

21:46.596 --> 21:47.556
I have no money.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.141
What?

21:49.766 --> 21:51.435
I think my business is going badly.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.813
I might have to take out my house deposit
to pay for the rent here.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.190
Let me take a look at the ledger.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.317
Ledger?

22:00.193 --> 22:03.405
Even elementary school students would do
a better job than this.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.615
You have to organize this with Excel.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.034
Excel?

22:08.660 --> 22:11.747
-You're pretty smart.
-You don't even know such a thing?

22:12.497 --> 22:15.792
If you lack experience,
you should hire an experienced part-timer.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.336
Business isn't a joke.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.050
Pass.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.510
You're hired.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.477
Did you think I'd be excited?

22:34.436 --> 22:36.021
This isn't time to play around.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.568
1, 2.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.489
Who taught you that dance?

22:45.572 --> 22:47.783
I just watched video clips...

22:47.908 --> 22:49.993
You learned this
only by watching videos?

22:50.077 --> 22:51.995
-Stop it.
-Why? It's cool.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.164
I respect those who are good at dancing.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.041
How did you...

22:59.753 --> 23:01.088
Amber Five?

23:02.839 --> 23:05.509
-But it smells a bit different.
-It is Amber Five.

23:08.303 --> 23:10.514
I knew you were interested
in perfume, too.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.600
Well, I'm the teaching assistant
of the chemistry department.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.523
But it smelled a bit different
from the familiar scent of Amber Five.

23:19.606 --> 23:23.193
People all have their own body scent.
It affects the scent.

23:24.694 --> 23:27.823
Like how you dance this move is
different from how I do it.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.326
That's not how you do it.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.744
This.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.165
All right, look.
Stand still like this.

23:39.126 --> 23:40.710
Put your arms like this.

23:41.294 --> 23:44.005
-Like this.
-Like this?

23:45.006 --> 23:46.341
I respect that, seriously.

23:55.892 --> 23:57.936
I plan to hold a housewarming party
this Saturday.

23:59.396 --> 24:01.690
I'm going to see my parents this Saturday.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.485
Then how about Sunday?

24:06.903 --> 24:09.281
Good for me,
but I'm not sure about Hyun-jung.

24:09.656 --> 24:10.490
Really?

24:10.866 --> 24:13.368
How about we create a group chat
to talk about it?

24:14.035 --> 24:15.745
Sure, I'll make it.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.249
Let's not make it grand
like a real party.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.960
Let's just gather up
and eat delicious food.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.378
Kyung-seok said he'd come.

24:24.129 --> 24:25.255
-What?
-Why?

24:28.216 --> 24:29.301
It's nothing.

24:33.513 --> 24:35.307
<i>We're friends. Friends.</i>

24:41.813 --> 24:42.689
GROUP CHAT ROOM

24:42.772 --> 24:44.065
ARE YOU FREE THIS SUNDAY?

24:44.149 --> 24:45.942
I'M GOOD
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYUNG-SEOK?

24:46.026 --> 24:46.860
Kyung-seok.

24:48.945 --> 24:49.946
Well...

24:52.115 --> 24:54.117
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

24:54.201 --> 24:58.246
I didn't mean to look at your phone
on purpose.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.208
It's just that a message popped up
on the screen.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.127
I told only a few of my friends,

25:04.211 --> 25:07.297
but word got out in the entire department.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.176
Sorry.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.559
I heard it from Ji-hyo.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.813
-Sorry about misunderstanding.
-It's nothing new.

25:24.689 --> 25:25.607
I'm fine.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.236
I was shocked more by...

25:30.695 --> 25:33.031
how you sounded like
you expected this from me.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.160
I realized how you thought of me.

25:38.578 --> 25:42.207
You must've kept misunderstanding
if it hadn't been for Ji-hyo.

25:46.419 --> 25:50.882
You think
all my behaviors are intentional.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.848
How you think about me is up to you.

26:00.141 --> 26:02.310
But it was a bit upsetting for me
this time.

26:09.234 --> 26:10.068
You know...

26:14.656 --> 26:15.991
I don't have a mom either.

26:18.493 --> 26:24.165
That's why I know how it feels
to have my hurtful experience...

26:25.625 --> 26:26.668
revealed to others.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.339
No one knows about it.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.133
You're the first.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.805
You know what it means, right?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.737
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYUNG-SEOK?

26:54.321 --> 26:55.405
Okay.

26:57.073 --> 26:57.907
Okay.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.747
The CEO was taken to the emergency room
just a while ago.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.665
The director went with her.

27:05.749 --> 27:08.668
-What?
-Why was she taken to the hospital?

27:08.752 --> 27:10.170
I'm not sure.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.797
-Let's go.
-Okay.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.132
Thank you. Goodbye.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.761
All right, guys.

27:18.511 --> 27:22.724
These two have something to tell you.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.060
Come on.

27:27.520 --> 27:31.733
I think I offended you
during the preparation period.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.070
I didn't know you were that sensitive.
I'm sorry.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.031
-Me, too.
-What are you sorry about?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.910
Well, for criticizing you
about your looks.

27:41.993 --> 27:43.370
I can't hear you.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.834
I'm sorry that I criticized you
about your looks...

27:50.418 --> 27:53.838
and forced only the female students
to wait tables.

27:54.422 --> 27:55.674
What about the uniforms?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.093
I'm sorry.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.261
I'm really sorry, too.

28:01.179 --> 28:03.306
We'll never do that again. We're sorry.

28:05.809 --> 28:08.728
Stop being mad at us.
I scolded these two harshly.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.899
We have to see each other around.
Will you keep being awkward?

28:12.982 --> 28:16.528
They can sound mean and rude,
but you know that they're not bad guys.

28:16.611 --> 28:17.612
-Aren't I right?
-Yes.

28:17.696 --> 28:18.655
Yes.

28:20.156 --> 28:24.828
We will accept your apology, but how
you behave from now on matters more.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.663
Thanks, Yoon-byeol.

28:26.746 --> 28:28.832
Then let's raise our glasses, everyone.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.835
Good work with the festival,
and we're sorry again.

28:31.918 --> 28:33.753
My, what a beautiful sight!

28:33.837 --> 28:36.214
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers!

28:36.297 --> 28:37.882
Good work, everyone.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.350
Have the two of you been hanging out
often lately?

28:47.934 --> 28:50.937
Seeing the two of you together is
a bit weird.

28:51.020 --> 28:53.732
What's weird about it? We're close.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.108
Right, Kyung-seok?

28:57.527 --> 28:58.737
Yes.

28:59.654 --> 29:03.158
-Does it mean we have a new couple?
-Does it mean we have a new couple?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.079
What did she eat?

29:08.163 --> 29:10.331
She must've eaten spoiled food.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.208
Thankfully, she's okay this time.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.043
She can be discharged tomorrow.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.212
Has something like this happened before?

29:16.796 --> 29:19.591
She has been in the ER
after eating spoiled food.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.969
It must've smelled very bad.

29:23.762 --> 29:26.139
She probably hasn't told either of you,

29:26.639 --> 29:30.226
but she can barely smell anything
at the moment.

29:30.810 --> 29:31.895
-Sorry?
-Pardon?

29:33.188 --> 29:36.858
She was in a big accident and
her olfactory nerve was severely damaged.

29:36.941 --> 29:38.318
My goodness.

29:38.401 --> 29:41.529
That's why she ends up eating spoiled food
at times.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.616
Then Kelun Korea... What about perfumes?

29:44.699 --> 29:46.367
She's very impressive.

29:46.826 --> 29:50.997
It's like a singer losing her voice
and a painter losing her sight.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.462
Excuse me for a moment.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.548
Yes, sir.

30:01.341 --> 30:04.803
Something urgent came up.
Yes, I apologize.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.721
I'll call you in a bit.

30:07.347 --> 30:08.181
Okay.

30:09.432 --> 30:12.268
You can go if you need to.
I'll stay here.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.312
Would you really do that for me?

30:14.687 --> 30:16.731
I can be back in two to three hours.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.484
Yes, I'll stay right by her side.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.569
You can get going too.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.071
Gosh, how could I...

30:23.154 --> 30:25.156
It's okay. You can go.

30:25.240 --> 30:26.574
Please look after her.

30:39.254 --> 30:42.423
Oh, does Ms. Na have no family?

30:43.299 --> 30:45.343
Didn't Professor Park tell you?

30:45.885 --> 30:46.803
About what?

30:46.886 --> 30:48.763
It was in the newspapers too.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.724
She got divorced years ago.
She lives alone.

30:52.976 --> 30:53.977
I see.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.648
I actually wanted to get in touch
with her son earlier,

30:58.982 --> 31:01.985
but I didn't because she'd probably
get mad at me if she found out.

31:02.819 --> 31:04.654
He's in the chemistry department.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.365
He's in our department? What's his name?

31:07.448 --> 31:08.867
His name is Do Kyung-seok.

31:09.784 --> 31:13.329
Please pretend you know nothing.
Ms. Na hasn't seen him in years.

31:14.497 --> 31:15.540
Oh, okay.

31:16.124 --> 31:19.377
-This has to stay between us.
-Yes.

31:57.165 --> 31:57.999
Thanks.

32:01.085 --> 32:04.047
I didn't want to tell anyone about it.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.967
But I do feel much better
now that I've told someone.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.183
Do Kyung-seok and Hyun Sua.

32:15.308 --> 32:17.518
Both are good-looking
and from rich families.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.728
Parallel theory?

32:20.855 --> 32:22.565
Parallel lines never meet.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.567
Look at you. You sound so confident.

32:24.859 --> 32:27.570
-Just go and grab the microphone.
-The microphone?

32:35.078 --> 32:36.371
KANG MI-RAE

32:55.556 --> 32:57.642
Ladies and gentlemen.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.978
Next up is the star of Hankook University.

33:00.144 --> 33:01.854
The most beautiful angel,

33:02.063 --> 33:05.191
Hyun Sua, will sing for us!

33:05.358 --> 33:07.694
Please give her a big hand!

33:08.361 --> 33:11.864
-Hyun Sua!
-Hyun Sua!

33:14.033 --> 33:14.867
Where are you?

33:18.329 --> 33:19.414
You're at a hospital?

33:19.497 --> 33:23.334
<i>Ms. Na is hospitalized</i>
<i>because of food poisoning.</i>

33:24.502 --> 33:26.462
<i>She ate food that had gone bad.</i>

33:30.967 --> 33:34.721
I heard she can't smell things anymore
due to an accident.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.181
Did you know about it?

33:39.642 --> 33:42.353
<i>I'm staying with her now</i>
<i>because she has no one else.</i>

33:45.440 --> 33:46.691
Will you come?

33:50.862 --> 33:51.779
No.

33:55.867 --> 33:59.412
Well, there's something
I have to tell you.

34:00.204 --> 34:04.417
I actually saw her back in middle school.

34:06.753 --> 34:09.755
<i>I'm saying I saw your mom</i>
<i>in our neighborhood.</i>

34:11.090 --> 34:13.259
She must've come to see you.

34:15.553 --> 34:16.596
I have to go.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.869
<i>Room 1013 at Hankook University Hospital.</i>

34:40.536 --> 34:43.164
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I won't meddle in your business anymore.</i>

34:54.550 --> 34:57.011
-Are you okay?
-How do you feel?

34:57.094 --> 35:00.139
Yes. I'm so sorry
that you had to stay here.

35:00.431 --> 35:03.017
Soo-hyun, please drive Mi-rae home.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.937
No, I can take the bus home.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.146
I'll call a cab.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.650
Director Lee.
I want you to go home as well.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.027
I can't leave you alone.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.863
Don't worry. I'm not a kid.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.824
You're more stubborn than a kid.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.660
I'll be off now.

35:21.369 --> 35:23.830
-Bye.
-Hold on, Mi-rae.

35:26.332 --> 35:27.416
Thank you.

35:29.752 --> 35:30.878
No problem.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.549
Goodbye. Take good care of yourself.

35:53.192 --> 35:54.569
Hey, Woo-young.

35:55.486 --> 35:58.739
Ms. Na woke up. Don't worry.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.325
Bye.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.495
-Woo-young came as well?
-Yes.

36:05.746 --> 36:06.873
What am I going to do?

36:07.999 --> 36:09.208
I caused everyone trouble.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.294
That's why you should hire an assistant.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.672
What kind of a CEO doesn't have
an assistant and drives herself?

36:14.755 --> 36:17.800
I really hate it when someone keeps...

36:19.552 --> 36:20.595
following me around.

36:20.678 --> 36:24.098
Gosh, what if you get into an accident?

36:24.307 --> 36:26.184
I've never been in a car accident.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.709
Then at least date someone.

36:52.376 --> 36:55.796
Isn't it sad that I'm the only one
who's here to take care of you?

36:55.880 --> 36:59.050
You're not really caring for me.
Gosh, stop nagging and leave.

36:59.133 --> 37:02.803
Are you going to get old all by yourself,
just missing your kids?

37:03.387 --> 37:05.139
You should start settling down.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.600
If I meet a few more of your girlfriends,
it'll add up to 100.

37:07.683 --> 37:09.769
What are you talking about?

37:09.852 --> 37:11.020
You should leave now.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.481
I'll get discharged on my own,
so don't come.

37:22.406 --> 37:23.574
Kyung-seok.

37:30.623 --> 37:31.457
Do Sang-won!

37:31.540 --> 37:33.334
-I'm a fan.
-Do Sang-won!

37:33.960 --> 37:35.544
-Have some.
-Do Sang-won!

37:35.711 --> 37:37.004
-Here.
-Do Sang-won!

37:37.588 --> 37:39.006
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

37:39.632 --> 37:41.342
Goodness, have a drink.

37:41.801 --> 37:44.178
-It will cheer you up.
-Okay, thank you.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.221
Drink up.

37:45.763 --> 37:46.597
Do Sang-won!

37:46.681 --> 37:48.140
Gosh, that's nice.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.976
-Sir.
-Yes?

37:50.142 --> 37:52.687
Kyung-seok and Ms. Na are together
right now.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.355
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

37:54.438 --> 37:56.399
I'm sorry. I'll report to you later.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.985
-Do Sang-won!
-Do Sang-won!

38:02.238 --> 38:05.283
I never even imagined that you would come.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.830
I'm so grateful toward Mi-rae.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.207
You too.

38:17.461 --> 38:19.046
I missed you so much.

38:20.381 --> 38:24.176
But now that you're here,
I don't know what to say.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.181
I can't even bring myself to apologize.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.183
If you're sorry,

38:32.810 --> 38:34.186
you should apologize.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.317
What are you sorry about?

38:42.194 --> 38:44.572
For leaving you and your sister.

38:49.493 --> 38:50.870
I regretted it a lot.

38:52.580 --> 38:56.334
I figured I should've tried
to think about things differently.

39:00.963 --> 39:04.383
You should quit work.
You don't need to earn money.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.927
Money isn't the problem.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.598
It's my life-long dream
to become a perfumer.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.689
I told you that
I'm working overtime today.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.233
Why do you always have trouble putting
the kids to bed?

39:22.318 --> 39:26.906
I looked after the kids every time
you had a plan or went to play golf.

39:27.198 --> 39:30.534
But I still managed to become
the youngest head researcher.

39:30.951 --> 39:32.411
I can't quit now.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.207
What are you trying to become
by working so hard?

39:36.290 --> 39:38.918
Everyone else dreams of becoming
a stay-at-home mom.

39:40.211 --> 39:43.172
<i>You know the typical question</i>
<i>that everyone asks actresses?</i>

39:43.589 --> 39:46.967
<i>"What's more important?</i>
<i>Your work or your family?"</i>

39:48.719 --> 39:52.223
I never thought there'd come a day
when I had to answer that question.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.060
Is that all?

40:02.566 --> 40:06.070
I got into an accident
and lost my ability to smell.

40:07.321 --> 40:08.906
I also went through a lot with it.

40:11.158 --> 40:13.411
Because I could no longer work
as a perfumer.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.675
FATHER

40:32.388 --> 40:33.806
Kyung-seok isn't picking up?

40:36.434 --> 40:40.312
But is there a reason
why he shouldn't meet his mom?

40:42.064 --> 40:44.275
Is there something
he shouldn't know about

40:44.358 --> 40:48.112
that might make him leave you
and run off to live with his mother?

40:52.116 --> 40:53.534
Never mind. I'm sorry.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.912
Cut the nonsense,
and just focus on giving me reports.

40:57.037 --> 40:57.913
Yes, sir.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.971
It's late. You should go home.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.058
You should sleep.

41:19.268 --> 41:20.436
I'll go a little later.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.489
Stay healthy.

43:26.228 --> 43:27.146
Kyung-seok.

43:28.314 --> 43:29.857
Did you spend the night somewhere?

43:30.399 --> 43:31.317
Yes.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.320
Kyung-seok, come inside.

43:43.996 --> 43:44.872
Sit down.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.335
Where were you?

43:50.502 --> 43:51.795
I met Ms. Na.

43:56.050 --> 43:59.637
Okay. I'm sure you missed her.
I understand.

44:00.304 --> 44:01.930
But it's hard to understand her.

44:02.681 --> 44:05.809
She never reached out to you for 10 years,
and now shows up.

44:05.893 --> 44:07.895
She once came
when I was in middle school.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.231
I didn't get to meet her.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.319
Did she tell you
that I didn't let her meet you?

44:21.659 --> 44:23.577
Okay, fine. I didn't let her meet you.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.705
How dare she show up
when she left after having an affair?

44:29.249 --> 44:30.250
That's not true.

44:30.793 --> 44:31.669
What?

44:32.503 --> 44:33.712
She didn't have an affair.

44:37.424 --> 44:38.967
Why did you lie?

44:40.969 --> 44:41.970
Why did you do that?

44:45.599 --> 44:48.394
I can't believe she made up an excuse
to meet you.

44:51.563 --> 44:52.690
Did you even...

44:53.816 --> 44:54.692
have me followed?

44:55.859 --> 44:57.194
Or did you do that to her?

45:00.364 --> 45:01.740
That wasn't an excuse.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.285
You must know it was food poisoning.

45:05.786 --> 45:07.579
And that she hurt her olfactory nerves.

45:08.163 --> 45:08.997
What?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.798
That was a mistake.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.008
Just once.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.220
I hit her one time by mistake.

45:32.855 --> 45:33.856
For a woman,

45:35.941 --> 45:38.944
it was natural to be responsible
for her family, not her job.

45:39.027 --> 45:41.864
Who would like his wife
to keep staying outside?

45:41.947 --> 45:45.451
Every time, work came first
before family for her.

45:51.540 --> 45:53.917
I told you to stay home comfortably.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.253
What's comfortable for me?

45:56.920 --> 45:59.715
I have no intention of living
the way you want.

46:00.090 --> 46:02.009
I'm doing my best here.

46:02.092 --> 46:06.513
You keep talking back to your husband.
You think you're that great?

46:07.181 --> 46:08.098
How pathetic.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.641
What?

46:10.726 --> 46:12.978
How you're trying to have control over me.

46:16.231 --> 46:17.649
Did you really say that?

46:20.861 --> 46:21.695
Why you...

46:30.746 --> 46:32.456
Hye-sung.

46:32.539 --> 46:36.794
<i>When I knew that her olfactory sense was</i>
<i>paralyzed, I begged as hard as I could.</i>

46:37.419 --> 46:40.547
I promised her thousands of times
that I'd make her happy

46:40.714 --> 46:42.800
after she resigned from being a perfumer.

46:43.759 --> 46:46.303
But she cared only for her job.

46:47.513 --> 46:49.431
That was why she went crazy.

46:50.015 --> 46:51.600
You ruined someone else's life,

46:53.852 --> 46:55.437
and you said you'd make her happy?

46:57.314 --> 46:58.148
What?

46:58.232 --> 47:01.235
You even ruined our lives
with your lies until now.

47:03.862 --> 47:05.489
And you cared about your family?

47:07.157 --> 47:08.534
Watch what you say.

47:09.034 --> 47:10.577
I raised you until now.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.871
I wouldn't have let you
had I known sooner.

47:13.372 --> 47:14.331
Kyung-seok.

47:14.414 --> 47:16.291
I would've chosen to grow up alone.

47:17.876 --> 47:19.086
Then get out.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.053
You must've kicked my mom out...

47:29.054 --> 47:30.305
this way, right?

47:31.223 --> 47:32.182
What?

47:39.189 --> 47:42.109
Kyung-seok. Stop right there.
Kyung-seok!

47:58.000 --> 47:59.668
<i>Does anyone not like pork?</i>

47:59.751 --> 48:00.669
<i>Not me.</i>

48:00.752 --> 48:02.713
<i>I can't eat it because there isn't any.</i>

48:02.796 --> 48:04.089
<i>Is pork belly okay then?</i>

48:04.172 --> 48:05.048
<i>Good.</i>

48:06.300 --> 48:07.384
<i>Me too.</i>

48:09.094 --> 48:11.471
GROUP CHAT ROOM

48:15.267 --> 48:17.144
INCOMING CALL: DAD

48:18.395 --> 48:19.438
Hey, Dad.

48:20.981 --> 48:23.817
I'm almost there.
I'm getting off at the next stop.

48:27.946 --> 48:29.031
Okay.

48:36.538 --> 48:38.373
Wait. Dad.

48:42.544 --> 48:45.547
You didn't have to come all the way here.
I could've walked.

48:47.257 --> 48:48.342
Get in.

49:05.317 --> 49:06.652
It's amazing.

49:08.528 --> 49:10.364
You're pretty

49:11.990 --> 49:13.575
however I take pictures of you.

49:15.744 --> 49:17.412
Let her have her meal.

49:17.496 --> 49:19.456
You're still awkward with her looks.

49:19.539 --> 49:20.707
What do you mean?

49:20.791 --> 49:23.502
You worried about her every day,
but you can't see her.

49:23.585 --> 49:25.212
What do you mean, I can't?

49:37.015 --> 49:39.184
It's still awkward, isn't it?

49:39.267 --> 49:40.143
No, no.

49:44.648 --> 49:45.732
It's pretty and nice.

49:47.150 --> 49:48.568
Are you not angry anymore?

49:48.652 --> 49:51.905
He blew off his anger a long time ago.
He's just awkward.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.616
Stop it already. I'm not awkward.

49:55.450 --> 49:56.660
How about karaoke?

49:56.743 --> 49:58.370
-Karaoke?
-Yes.

49:58.453 --> 50:00.288
How about we go for a round?

50:01.915 --> 50:02.749
Sounds great.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.043
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

50:05.627 --> 50:07.254
Mom, you should hurry up too.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.090
Dad.

50:12.884 --> 50:14.011
I think he ran away.

50:16.972 --> 50:19.057
<i>I'll call you. Take care.</i>

50:31.737 --> 50:32.821
<i>Who are you?</i>

50:32.904 --> 50:34.406
Is Seo Yoo-jin there?

50:34.489 --> 50:35.407
<i>Mom.</i>

50:36.992 --> 50:38.160
<i>Who is it?</i>

50:39.870 --> 50:41.329
Isn't this Seo Yoo-jin's house?

50:41.413 --> 50:44.499
<i>No, it's not. We just moved in here.</i>

51:02.684 --> 51:04.436
Why did you fight with your father?

51:05.020 --> 51:06.396
A bed in this room?

51:06.480 --> 51:08.315
It costs money to throw it away.

51:08.398 --> 51:11.318
And I can't sleep on the floor.
My back will hurt.

51:13.320 --> 51:16.573
You're just as pathetic.
You have no plans.

51:18.950 --> 51:19.785
Do you have money?

51:24.206 --> 51:26.041
The summer season is coming up soon.

51:26.124 --> 51:29.127
I'm not sure if I'll be able
to turn on the air conditioner.

51:31.421 --> 51:33.006
I'm not that sensitive to heat.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.008
Don't act up and move back in.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.760
Living alone isn't easy.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.262
You'll be just like me
if you miss the timing.

51:54.277 --> 51:55.278
Sua.

51:57.989 --> 51:59.449
Hey, you.

52:00.158 --> 52:01.785
What brings you here?

52:01.868 --> 52:05.080
-Do you live in this neighborhood?
-Yes.

52:06.331 --> 52:08.792
Didn't you say you live in Dogok-dong?

52:08.875 --> 52:11.169
I moved out recently.

52:11.253 --> 52:12.337
Oh, really?

52:12.420 --> 52:13.839
It hasn't been a few days.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.801
I'll leave you then. See you at school.

52:17.884 --> 52:19.219
Okay, bye.

52:29.813 --> 52:32.566
Yes!

52:32.774 --> 52:35.026
-Goodness.
-Gosh, I'm tired.

52:35.735 --> 52:37.612
Mi-rae. Let's...

52:39.156 --> 52:41.950
add some more time now.

52:42.033 --> 52:43.869
Give us...

52:43.952 --> 52:46.997
-One more hour!
-One more hour!

52:47.873 --> 52:49.040
Let's go!

52:50.709 --> 52:53.295
Mom, wait up.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.547
I need to go home and lie down.

52:56.006 --> 52:57.174
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

52:58.175 --> 53:01.303
We did all the singing.
Why is she exhausted?

53:01.928 --> 53:04.055
Dad, you sang twice as much as I did.

53:05.015 --> 53:08.185
I hadn't been to karaoke in so long.
There were many new songs.

53:25.035 --> 53:27.120
Dad, you still got it.

53:32.167 --> 53:33.752
I'm sorry about everything.

53:36.671 --> 53:37.547
No, don't be.

53:38.840 --> 53:40.508
Just because I adore you,

53:41.176 --> 53:42.886
it doesn't mean you can be happy.

53:44.429 --> 53:46.306
I was too self-centered.

53:59.861 --> 54:01.363
You're still pretty,

54:02.906 --> 54:04.032
my dear daughter.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.162
It must've been very hard for you, Dad.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.957
I'm sorry.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.469
It's okay.

54:27.430 --> 54:28.974
You'll look ugly if you cry.

54:33.979 --> 54:34.813
Let's go.

54:37.274 --> 54:40.610
Oh, right. I forgot about BTS.

56:11.117 --> 56:12.410
Where is he?

56:16.748 --> 56:17.707
Honey.

56:20.794 --> 56:22.170
Where did he go?

56:35.225 --> 56:36.976
Where did he go?

56:49.948 --> 56:51.574
What are you doing out here?

57:18.726 --> 57:23.731
I wish I had a chance to say goodbye
to Mi-rae's old face.

57:28.736 --> 57:30.113
I'm sorry.

57:56.848 --> 57:58.057
Let's go back inside.

58:01.436 --> 58:02.812
I'm really sorry.

58:06.566 --> 58:07.650
Let's go back in.

59:07.752 --> 59:09.045
-Excuse me.
-Oh, my.

59:09.504 --> 59:11.381
Your place is so nice.

59:11.881 --> 59:13.299
It looks really nice.

59:14.342 --> 59:17.011
My gosh, you have such a nice place.

59:18.721 --> 59:21.683
Woo-young, take this.
It's my housewarming gift for you.

59:21.766 --> 59:23.309
Mi-rae made it.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.107
Oh, a Chypre scent.

59:30.817 --> 59:31.651
Thank you.

59:31.734 --> 59:35.697
I thought the scent would suit you.
That's why I chose it.

59:37.657 --> 59:40.118
Ms. Na was right.
You really have the talent.

59:48.334 --> 59:50.461
The view from here is incredible.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.298
Isn't it pretty good for the rent
I'm paying?

59:53.381 --> 59:54.966
Your place is amazing.

59:56.968 --> 59:58.636
It's like a penthouse.

59:59.762 --> 1:00:01.306
Can we come over often?

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:02.557
Yes, of course.

1:00:05.143 --> 1:00:06.978
The first time
I'm having girls over.

1:00:07.061 --> 1:00:08.813
-Seriously?
-Yes.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.189
Are you conservative?

1:00:10.773 --> 1:00:12.108
No, not really.

1:00:12.650 --> 1:00:15.862
I couldn't when I was living in a dorm
or a basement apartment.

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:17.655
I thought they'd be uncomfortable.

1:00:19.490 --> 1:00:20.950
You're very honest.

1:00:21.826 --> 1:00:23.536
By the way, isn't Kyung-seok coming?

1:00:25.496 --> 1:00:28.583
I'm not sure. I haven't heard from him.

1:00:30.043 --> 1:00:32.378
GROUP CHAT

1:00:34.297 --> 1:00:36.299
IS EVERYONE OKAY WITH PORK BELLY?

1:00:53.024 --> 1:00:56.152
It's not brand new,
but it was bought recently.

1:01:22.303 --> 1:01:25.682
<i>Could Do Kyung-seok have a crush on you?</i>

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:27.433
Mi-rae, we should watch a movie.

1:01:27.517 --> 1:01:30.311
<i>She'll watch a movie with a guy</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

1:01:30.395 --> 1:01:31.646
<i>With a handsome guy.</i>

1:01:31.729 --> 1:01:33.773
<i>No, it's just an assignment.</i>

1:01:33.856 --> 1:01:35.358
<i>Why do I miss him?</i>

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:38.361
-How about a movie with me?
-I'm going with someone else.

1:01:38.444 --> 1:01:40.697
-You want to be my roommate?
-Yes.

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:42.240
<i>What on earth is this about?</i>

1:01:42.323 --> 1:01:44.033
Are you trying to get back at me?

1:01:44.117 --> 1:01:45.952
<i>Is it possible?</i>

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:49.872
<i>To think of a guy like that</i>
<i>just as a friend.</i>
