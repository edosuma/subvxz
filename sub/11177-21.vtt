00:02.560 --> 00:05.360
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family
who lost everything...</i>

00:05.440 --> 00:07.360
<i>and the one son
who had no choice...</i>

00:07.480 --> 00:09.400
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:16.280
<i>It's Arrested Development.</i>

00:19.360 --> 00:22.520
<i>Michael was heading off
to work when his son, George Michael...</i>

00:22.600 --> 00:25.240
<i>- reminded him of a yearly tradition.
- Hey, don't forget me.</i>

00:25.320 --> 00:28.080
- For what?
- It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.400
And unless you had a daughter
I don't know about, I'm your girl.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.880
<i>Michael had first made
this joke when George Michael was six.</i>

00:34.000 --> 00:37.440
Well, she's not my daughter,
but it's about as close as I'm gonna get.

00:37.560 --> 00:39.480
I'm a good little girl.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.240
<i>It was a joke Michael was
starting to grow concerned about...</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:45.120
<i>- as it had not worn well with age.
- Hey, Dad.</i>

00:45.240 --> 00:47.520
They're out of sanitary napkins
in the ladies' washroom.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.000
Weird kid.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.680
I don't think this
year's such a good idea.

00:53.715 --> 00:54.960
You know you're getting older and...

00:55.040 --> 00:58.080
Yeah, right. Pretty soon I'm going to have
to start wearing a bra. Right, Dad?

00:58.200 --> 01:00.680
<i>- All right, give me one minute.
- Really, let's not this year.</i>

01:00.800 --> 01:03.240
I cannot kill this joke.

01:03.360 --> 01:05.600
<i>Hey, shouldn't you
be getting dressed?</i>

01:05.720 --> 01:07.880
- Nope. I'm going with
my dad to work today.

01:07.915 --> 01:09.120
- Hey, peanut butter cup.

01:09.240 --> 01:11.400
This is work?
Watching entertainment news?

01:11.520 --> 01:14.400
Well, excuse me, Michael, for not raising
the perfect daughter that you did.

01:14.520 --> 01:17.280
<i>I indulged this ritual
for years in Boston.</i>

01:17.400 --> 01:21.160
<i>As a psychotherapist, Tobias was on
the forefront of the self-esteem movement.</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:25.120
There's, like, this longing, this pull.

01:25.240 --> 01:28.000
I mean, does that make me,
you know, like some kind of...

01:28.080 --> 01:31.160
- Homosexual.
- Maeby, please.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.000
She's right though.
You probably are a homosexual.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.800
So, Maeby, this is what
you're gonna do this year?

01:38.835 --> 01:39.880
You're gonna watch him watch TV?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.840
<i>Behind the scenes
at Entertainment Tonight.</i>

01:41.920 --> 01:46.080
Oh, bless her. It's like she knew
what I was going to do next.

01:46.200 --> 01:50.200
<i>It's here! Girls with
- Newport Beach.</i>

01:50.280 --> 01:52.320
From the act I did
on the beach over spring break.

01:52.440 --> 01:55.200
<i>- Any magician...
- Gob had done a magic show...</i>

01:55.320 --> 01:58.760
<i>where he had made the Bluth
family yacht... disappear.</i>

01:58.880 --> 02:03.480
<i>It was spring break, and the act
was filmed for the popular video series...</i>

02:03.560 --> 02:06.360
Girls with Low Self-Esteem.

02:06.440 --> 02:09.120
This puts me back on top of
the old magic career though.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.160
You're not gonna put that in.
There's nudity on that.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.080
Maeby, why don't you go
upstairs and get dressed?

02:13.160 --> 02:14.245
I must warn you, Michael.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.360
She doesn't respond well
to strict directives.

02:16.480 --> 02:18.640
All right.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.400
- That was odd.
- Not really. Kids love boundaries.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.480
<i>Look at these girls.
Is this what you want?</i>

02:23.560 --> 02:24.039
- Oh, God, no.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.880
- 'Cause this could be where
your daughter is headed.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.120
Oh, no, no. I don't want this
for Maeby either, no.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.120
Oh, here it is. Here it is.

02:30.240 --> 02:32.040
<i>It was a wild time on the beach.</i>

02:32.160 --> 02:34.920
<i>And if you like magic, look away.</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:39.240
<i>The only thing this guy could
make fly away was the crowd.</i>

02:39.360 --> 02:42.800
Douche chill.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.440
I can't believe they used that part.

02:45.520 --> 02:47.360
The one part where I screw up.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.520
It's not like they used the part
where I made the yacht disappear.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.320
Sunk the yacht.
Blew it up, sunk it.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.240
- We sure did.
- We? No.

02:54.360 --> 02:56.160
I gave you permission to use
the yacht. You blew it up.

02:56.280 --> 02:58.520
Yeah, well, if you give someone
permission to use a tissue...

02:58.600 --> 03:01.000
you can't be upset
if they blow their nose.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.200
Right? I mean, right?

03:03.320 --> 03:06.400
<i>Lindsay, new outfit?</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:08.600
No, I've had this for years.
It's a hand-me-down from Mom.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.800
- Got a price tag right there.
- Is there?

03:10.880 --> 03:14.360
Oh, I guess she wanted me to have
something new. Sweet old thing.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.520
Only two of those words describe Mom,
so I know you're lying to me.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.240
Fine. I bought it before
we went broke, okay?

03:20.275 --> 03:21.840
I just haven't worn it yet.

03:21.920 --> 03:25.400
- What about the outfit yesterday?
- Old Thing gave it to me.

03:25.480 --> 03:28.520
- Where are you getting all the money?
- It's not costing you anything.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.400
Unless you're stealing or working,
I'm pretty sure it is.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.640
<i>That's right. I stole it.</i>

03:32.760 --> 03:35.320
<i>In fact, Lindsay,
tired of wearing last year's fashions...</i>

03:35.400 --> 03:38.480
<i>went to an upscale department store
and in a moment of desperation...</i>

03:38.560 --> 03:41.240
<i>- applied for a job.
- Can I have a job application please?</i>

03:41.320 --> 03:43.520
<i>But she was ashamed
ofbeing a shopgirl...</i>

03:43.600 --> 03:45.760
<i>and was relieved when Michael
gave her the out.</i>

03:45.880 --> 03:47.440
Well, they expect a
certain amount of theft,

03:47.475 --> 03:48.720
Michael. It's built into the price.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.520
If I didn't take it, then people
would be overpaying for nothing.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.440
You're telling me that you
walked into a store...

03:53.560 --> 03:55.440
and without anyone noticing
took an entire outfit?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.920
<i>There's no way that you could
do sleight ofhand that well.</i>

03:58.040 --> 04:00.400
- I don't even think that I could do it.
- Yeah, I've seen your tape.

04:00.480 --> 04:04.320
<i>- Lindsay, this is appalling.
- What'd you use for misdirection?</i>

04:04.440 --> 04:07.920
- Misdirection?
- Yeah, I mean, if you're so good at magic...

04:08.000 --> 04:10.320
what'd you have them looking at
to divert their attention?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.440
I don't know... my ass.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.560
- My ass. You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.920
- You're gonna take that back.
- No, I'm not.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.600
This has nothing to do with you.
You're not my father.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.839
No, our father is in prison
for stealing, remember?

04:21.920 --> 04:23.640
<i>- Which might not be a bad
place for you to get used to.</i>

04:23.675 --> 04:24.119
- Michael...

04:24.120 --> 04:25.920
it was shoplifting,
and I'm white.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.040
<i>- I think I'm going to be okay.
- Shoplifting?</i>

04:28.160 --> 04:31.720
<i>- Cool. Can you take me?
- No. Hey, not cool. You know what?</i>

04:31.840 --> 04:33.680
Maeby, you're gonna come
with me to work today.

04:33.715 --> 04:34.840
You're gonna be my daughter.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.840
You're gonna have a role model
in your life who is honest...

04:36.960 --> 04:42.440
who doesn't steal, doesn't lie and,
I don't know, watch entertainment news.

04:42.560 --> 04:45.280
Michael, don't worry about it, okay?
She's not gonna go with you.

04:45.400 --> 04:46.840
- Okay.
- Great.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.720
That was odd.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.440
I'm going to teach you two a little
something about hands-on parenting.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.120
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

04:53.240 --> 04:55.840
Do you think this purse
goes with this outfit?

04:57.040 --> 05:01.160
- Where'd my dad go?
- Douche chill.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.320
<i>And so Michael took his niece
to Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.</i>

05:04.440 --> 05:06.000
You can just drop me off
at the mall.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.160
Oh, no, you're-you're
really coming with me.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.160
You're gonna learn a little
something about hard work.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.040
Hey, Maeby! Maeby!

05:16.200 --> 05:20.720
<i>Okay, so you can run faster than me.
But you can't make me work.</i>

05:20.800 --> 05:22.560
No one's making you
do anything, you know.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.840
It's just a chance for us to spend
some time together. Learn about business.

05:25.920 --> 05:29.400
You know, you might find that you're
good at things you didn't even know about.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.560
See that? Who knew you were
such a good little climber?

05:36.720 --> 05:38.560
Now listen,
let's make this fun, okay?

05:38.680 --> 05:40.480
We're family.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.880
What is better than hanging out
with family? Hmm?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.160
Oh...
It's my mother.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.520
- Hi.
- She called you, huh?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.560
I guess I'm not good enough
to be her husband.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.480
What? What's going on?

05:51.560 --> 05:54.600
Okay. Mother wants someone
to go to my soccer game with.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.640
She don't want other soccer moms
think that she a single mother.

05:57.760 --> 05:58.685
<i>- She old school.</i>

05:58.720 --> 06:01.080
- I liked it better when
he just said annyong.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.640
Hey, Mom, why can't Buster
pretend to be your escort?

06:03.760 --> 06:05.400
- That's the way he's got
it in all his cartoons.

06:05.435 --> 06:06.480
- They already know he's my son.

06:06.560 --> 06:09.200
I wouldn't go even if you asked.
You didn't let me play soccer as a child.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.000
Why should I have to
sit and cheer Annyong?

06:11.035 --> 06:11.960
Annyong never cheers me.

06:12.040 --> 06:14.000
Go, fatty.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.920
Stop it! He's your little brother!

06:18.040 --> 06:20.000
No, he's not!
I came out of you! He didn't!

06:20.120 --> 06:23.440
Can you not call me with
these little things, please?

06:23.520 --> 06:25.680
The office is a mess.
I still haven't replaced Kitty.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.640
<i>Michael had recently fired
his father's longtime assistant, Kitty.</i>

06:29.760 --> 06:31.960
Did you hear that everyone?
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

06:32.040 --> 06:33.760
<i>- Shh, shh, shh.
- It had not been a clean break.</i>

06:33.880 --> 06:34.925
So, I've got a lot of work to do.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.440
Plus, it's Bring Your
Daughter to Work Day.

06:36.520 --> 06:39.000
- Oh, where is George Michael?
- I told him not to come.

06:39.120 --> 06:42.080
I- I thought it was more
important to bring Maeby this...

06:44.160 --> 06:44.519
Damn it!

06:44.520 --> 06:47.520
Can't you just find somebody else,
please, to look like your husband?

06:47.640 --> 06:51.720
<i>In fact, there was someone else
who looked like Lucille's husband...</i>

06:51.840 --> 06:53.840
<i>- his twin brother, Oscar.
- Lucille.</i>

06:53.920 --> 06:57.040
<i>- And although she knew it was
wrong to play with his heart...</i>

06:57.075 --> 06:58.080
- Oscar, it's Lucille.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.600
<i>she really didn't want to go
to the soccer game alone.</i>

07:00.680 --> 07:04.320
I need you.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.240
<i>And back at the model home...</i>

07:06.360 --> 07:08.880
<i>three of the Bluth men
struggled with their manliness.</i>

07:08.960 --> 07:11.320
You know, I make jokes about
being a daughter for my dad.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.360
I know I'm a man.
It's his insecurity, not mine.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.800
There's no security at that store.
That's how she was able to shoplift.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.120
They probably don't have
a regular security guard.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.240
Well, of course I could get a job
as a security guard.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.800
I mean, if I have to have a job
to impress my daughter.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.720
If she needs something that butch.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.560
<i>Yeah. I can hang out with my uncles.
Three men. What's butcher than that?</i>

07:29.640 --> 07:32.160
- I'm going to the mall.
- Me too.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.800
Yeah, maybe a new pair
of shoes will cheer me up.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.440
And now I'm filling out
an expense report...

07:37.560 --> 07:40.760
so I can sleep well at night
knowing that I have been honest.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.680
You're not asleep.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.640
- I was.
- You were not.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.920
I would like to see if you could
go one day without telling a lie.

07:47.040 --> 07:49.920
just one whole day
without being like your mom.

07:50.040 --> 07:53.160
- What's in it for me if I do?
- You'll win my respect.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.600
- Good night.
- And 50 bucks.

07:55.680 --> 07:58.240
Fine. I'll do it if you do it.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.360
- That-a-girl. This is gonna be fun.
- I win.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.480
<i>- We're looking for Michael Bluth?
- That's me.</i>

08:05.600 --> 08:06.485
- I'm Michael Bluth.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.760
- I'm Officer Taylor.
That is Officer Carter.

08:08.840 --> 08:12.680
Our daughters, Tammy and Moni...
Oh, God, where... where did they go?

08:12.800 --> 08:14.840
- I'm on it.
- How can I help you?

08:14.920 --> 08:18.200
Well, we're here investigating
the disappearance of Kitty Sanchez.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.800
Apparently, you're the last person
to see her... alive.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.640
Or around town or whatever.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.240
I don't know anything about that.
I do know that, uh...

08:27.360 --> 08:29.920
she was my secretary,
uh, but she left.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.000
<i>Or I-I fired her.</i>

08:32.120 --> 08:34.080
<i>Did you ever threaten her?</i>

08:34.200 --> 08:35.919
No, no. God, no.
Of course not.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.760
Michael Bluth is threatening me!

08:38.880 --> 08:41.080
I did. I threatened her
at a restaurant.

08:41.159 --> 08:45.440
- But, you know...
it's a restaurant, so...

08:45.475 --> 08:46.239
- Yep.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.520
Certainly she's been seen since then?

08:48.640 --> 08:51.440
Not alive.

08:51.520 --> 08:53.640
Or dead or whatever.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.720
We'd love to speak with you
down at the station.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.920
Sure. Uh, you know,
I- I-I'm happy to cooperate.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.240
But I really don't know
anything more than you know.

09:01.320 --> 09:04.320
I certainly didn't... didn't kill her
and drop her in a back bay.

09:06.840 --> 09:08.280
- Boy, I hope that's
not what happened to her.

09:08.315 --> 09:09.115
- I'm sure it isn't.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.800
Please send Officer Davis
and Little Hanna to the back bay.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.880
So you killed Kitty, huh?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.800
No, I didn't kill Kitty.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.400
But I will go down to the station
and answer those nice men's questions.

09:19.520 --> 09:23.040
You know why? Because I have no secrets
to hide. Because I'm an honest man.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.160
<i>And apparently a fun one.</i>

09:25.280 --> 09:27.120
Let's go see what's
going on in the back room.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.840
Were those the last words
Kitty ever heard?

09:29.920 --> 09:32.160
No. I will not kiss her.

09:32.240 --> 09:36.280
Hey, hey, guys, what are you doing?
It's Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
<i>- Yeah, that's my Caitlin.
- Okay.</i>

09:38.440 --> 09:40.560
There is work to be done.
Can we get back to it? Thank you.

09:40.640 --> 09:44.840
Oh, and has anybody,
uh, seen or heard from Kitty lately?

09:44.960 --> 09:49.680
<i>I think that's her
right behind you there.</i>

09:49.760 --> 09:51.005
- Oh, my God. That is Kitty.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.120
- And that's the boat
that Uncle Gob blew up.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.480
<i>Hey, now you have something
to tell them at the station.</i>

10:02.520 --> 10:05.760
<i>Tobias sought out a security
position at the nearby mall.</i>

10:05.840 --> 10:10.200
I do know stage combat if the partner
is willing and a bit more petite than I.

10:10.320 --> 10:14.480
But I have a daughter to impress
and I need this job.

10:14.560 --> 10:18.360
Well, it's gonna be a couple of days
before we can get you a gun license...

10:18.480 --> 10:21.440
so you'll have to use mine.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.640
Wow!

10:23.760 --> 10:27.040
<i>Meanwhile, Gob had taken
George Michael on a mysterious errand.</i>

10:27.120 --> 10:29.520
What are we getting?
Is it something for a magic trick?

10:29.600 --> 10:31.680
- In a way.
- That's cool.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.200
You know, it's so great
to be hanging out with you.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.880
There are certain
things that I can talk to

10:35.915 --> 10:37.440
you about that I can't
really with my dad.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.720
<i>Like, uh, were-were you ever
awkward around girls?</i>

10:40.800 --> 10:41.600
What do you mean?

10:41.600 --> 10:44.680
Like if there were three of us
and I didn't know where to start?

10:44.800 --> 10:46.600
No, I think I did pretty well.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.720
Not a lot of complaints,
if you know what I mean.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.200
At least not from the girl.

10:51.320 --> 10:53.840
- You're saying I should just be myself?
- And he had to drive her home.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.800
So I think I did pretty good.
Pretty damn good.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.720
<i>- Hey, guy.
- Yes, sir?</i>

10:58.800 --> 11:02.080
How many mice will $13 buy?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.600
<i>And at the prison,
George Sr. had a surprise visit.</i>

11:04.720 --> 11:06.760
I just wanted to check in
and make sure you're aware...

11:06.880 --> 11:10.400
that your ban on organized sports
in this family has been violated.

11:10.480 --> 11:12.320
Ban on organized sports?

11:12.440 --> 11:15.320
You know, how you wouldn't let me
sign up for anything when I was a kid.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.600
Is that what you've been
thinking all these years? No, no.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.560
You were... You were
just a turd out there, you know?

11:20.640 --> 11:25.080
You couldn't kick and you couldn't run.
You know, you were just a-a turd.

11:25.200 --> 11:27.440
Prison has destroyed
the way you talk.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.920
If that's what it takes to
impress these guys around here,

11:29.955 --> 11:31.200
then they are not your friends.

11:31.280 --> 11:34.760
Anyway, Annyong's playing soccer,
but I guess I should just ignore it.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.400
Look the other way
as Mom and Uncle Oscar

11:36.435 --> 11:37.920
and Annyong have the
perfect little family...

11:38.040 --> 11:40.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,
wait, wait. Oscar? My brother Oscar?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.840
- Oscar's been coming around?
- No touching!

11:43.920 --> 11:46.080
No touching. No touching.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.720
You listen to me. You've got to
take care of this Oscar situation.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.640
You get him out of there, all right?

11:50.720 --> 11:53.440
You make him wish that he'd never
shown that ludicrous head of hair...

11:53.560 --> 11:55.520
and that nice face of his.

11:55.640 --> 11:59.000
- I will do it, Dad.
- Good. Put her there.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.600
- No touching!
- Oh!

12:01.720 --> 12:04.520
Her self-esteem is through the roof.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.000
<i>And Michael arrived
at the police station with Maeby.</i>

12:07.120 --> 12:09.280
I got here as quickly as I could.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.800
<i>- I didn't know you had a daughter?
- I don't.</i>

12:10.880 --> 12:12.800
I thought you wanted me
to call you Daddy?

12:12.880 --> 12:16.320
Why don't you wait
for Daddy in the car?

12:16.440 --> 12:19.520
- All right. What do we have here?
- Gob sunk the yacht.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.560
The last time Kitty was seen,
she was getting onto it. It's on tape.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.760
- Ooh! Did you see this?
- Yep.

12:25.840 --> 12:30.560
Ooh! Chills.
Why do I keep getting these bruises?

12:30.640 --> 12:32.840
- Barry!
- Okay. Until we get all the facts...

12:32.960 --> 12:35.200
don't say anything
that can incriminate you.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.920
Or me. Just try to
keep me out of this.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.805
- Lie. Both of you.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.320
- No, what are you talk...
We don't lie in this family.

12:41.440 --> 12:44.480
- Maeby, why don't you get a soda?
- Okay.

12:44.560 --> 12:47.120
If I lie in front of
her, it costs me 50 bucks.

12:47.155 --> 12:48.760
I do think that we should lie.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.760
<i>Meanwhile,
Lindsay was at work...</i>

12:51.840 --> 12:54.560
<i>and starting to getjealous that
her daughter was at work with Michael.</i>

12:54.640 --> 12:57.120
Hello, Michael. I know you think
I'm such a horrible mother...

12:57.240 --> 12:59.560
but I was just seeing how
my daughter was doing at work.

12:59.680 --> 13:03.880
Uh, she's, um, she's making
lots of friends already.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.360
<i>- Can you help me there, please?
- It was at this moment...</i>

13:06.480 --> 13:09.000
<i>that Gob and George Michael
arrived at the store.</i>

13:09.120 --> 13:10.285
Say what you will about America...

13:10.320 --> 13:12.160
13 bucks stills gets you
a hell of a lot of mice.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.080
Who said anything bad
about America?

13:14.160 --> 13:17.160
No. Well, I meant...
So what are the mice for?

13:17.280 --> 13:19.440
Oh. No, that's just for misdirection.

13:19.520 --> 13:23.000
We'll see who the sleight-of-hand artist
is in this family.

13:23.120 --> 13:26.000
Okay, now when I yell "Mice!"
I want you to open this box...

13:26.080 --> 13:28.600
- and I'm gonna start stuffing
some shirts down your pants.

13:28.635 --> 13:29.119
- Shirts?

13:29.120 --> 13:31.840
- Gob, are we shoplifting?
- Mice!

13:31.920 --> 13:34.080
<i>Mice! Call security!</i>

13:34.160 --> 13:36.640
- Michael, I'm not as bad an
influence as you think I am.

13:36.675 --> 13:38.000
- Well, you're not a great one.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.960
You're a criminal, Lindsay.
What kind of message does that send?

13:40.040 --> 13:42.640
Bluth. We're ready to question you now.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.760
That's what I am, Michael.
I'm a shoplifter!

13:44.840 --> 13:46.680
I've got a whole bag
of clothes I shoplifted.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.720
<i>But Tobias was now a guard.</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:51.880
<i>And a surprisingly catlike one.</i>

13:52.000 --> 13:56.680
<i>- Wow. I guess we didn't need the mice.
- Freeze...</i>

13:59.520 --> 14:01.800
<i>While the rest of the Bluths
were in police custody...</i>

14:01.920 --> 14:03.720
<i>Lucille was with
her brother-in-law.</i>

14:03.840 --> 14:08.000
I am blown away that you... that you
called me and that we're-we're together.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.320
And my camper made it
all the way up here.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.880
Do you think it's safe over there?
Because I only have a hanger for a lock.

14:12.960 --> 14:16.440
What are they gonna take,
the one can of Comet you've got in there?

14:16.520 --> 14:20.800
Oh, your tongue is as sharp
as your body is still taut.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.800
What are you doing?

14:22.880 --> 14:27.160
Oscar, this is a children's
soccer game, not Woodstock.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.360
That was another era, huh?
The music and the pot.

14:31.440 --> 14:32.445
Will you excuse me?

14:32.480 --> 14:35.080
I need to go to my camper
for just a quick sec.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.240
Open.

14:44.640 --> 14:49.680
- Hey, Uncle.
- Hey, Buster.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.280
No, no, no.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.000
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.800
No! No! No! I came here
to say something.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.920
You do not belong here.
My mother's been spoken for.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.440
You know, I may never have
played organized sports, but I am a man.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.039
- Buster.

15:09.040 --> 15:11.880
- And I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.600
Okay. But, uh, I never meant
to break up your family.

15:16.680 --> 15:20.040
Your mom called me for a reason.
And I don't think she's happy.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.000
No, she's happy.
She's just mean all the time.

15:28.480 --> 15:32.160
Uh, no, no, no, Uncle, let me get you.
I'm a man. Move.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.000
<i>Michael submitted
to the detective's questions.</i>

15:39.080 --> 15:41.720
You haven't seen any evidence of Ms.
Sanchez or where she might have gone?

15:41.800 --> 15:44.640
I have, uh, no idea. None.

15:44.720 --> 15:47.160
Are you willing to take
a polygraph to that effect?

15:49.560 --> 15:53.400
- Are you nuts?
- Not without a better lawyer.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.960
You're holding out on us!

15:56.040 --> 15:57.880
Fantastic. Now Emma's awake.

15:57.960 --> 16:01.560
- You know what? Let me take care of this.
- Please.

16:05.440 --> 16:08.640
Kitty had evidence against your father,
and you didn't want that to come out.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.320
But now you've got bigger problems,
my friend. So why don't we make a deal?

16:11.400 --> 16:14.360
I give you evidence against my father,
and you pretend that I didn't kill Kitty?

16:14.480 --> 16:16.640
I mean, I-I didn't kill Kitty.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.560
Hello. Oh, hey,
George Michael.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.280
Uh, I'm sorry.
In your pants?

16:24.360 --> 16:29.240
I'll be right there.
Um, my son has an emergency.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.640
<i>You know, there's a Grover book...
I Can't Hold It In.</i>

16:32.720 --> 16:35.840
Worked for us.

16:35.960 --> 16:40.240
<i>Buster emerged from Oscar's trailer
with a newfound sense of manliness...</i>

16:40.320 --> 16:42.960
<i>and then received
a serendipitous gift.</i>

16:44.440 --> 16:47.480
Kick it back!

16:47.560 --> 16:51.480
- If you can kick, fatty.
- I'm a man.

16:59.480 --> 17:02.840
What are you doing?
Get off the field!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.920
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

Advertise your product or brand here

17:21.160 --> 17:24.040
<i>And Buster realized
he may havejust scared away a man...</i>

17:24.160 --> 17:27.960
<i>who supported him in the way
he'd always hoped his own father would.</i>

17:35.760 --> 17:37.320
<i>And Michael headed
over to the mall.</i>

17:37.440 --> 17:38.565
- So what the hell is this?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.960
- Hey, Dad, I didn't know
we were shoplifting, okay?

17:41.080 --> 17:43.480
Shoplifting?
What's the matter with you, Gob?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.760
What's the matter with me?
She's the shoplifter!

17:45.880 --> 17:48.560
- I wasn't shoplifting, you twit.
- Yes, thanks to me.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.880
No. I work here.

17:51.000 --> 17:51.800
At least I used to.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.800
They fired me because they thought
I was helping this idiot shoplift.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.480
Also, they said I wasn't
a very good salesgirl.

17:57.600 --> 18:00.520
You can't be serious?

18:00.640 --> 18:02.520
<i>A salesgirl.</i>

18:02.640 --> 18:04.800
I knew it! I knew you
couldn't pull it off.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.640
There's only one magician
in this family and that is me.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.560
And you got caught by a 13-year-old girl.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.600
You know, this is why I'm constantly
asking you to stay away from my son.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.640
Yeah, well, it's not like you were there
to spend any time with me, Dad.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.600
Because I'm not daughter
enough for you.

18:17.720 --> 18:22.160
George Michael, um,
I'm always there for you, okay?

18:22.240 --> 18:23.800
It's just you're getting
a little too manly

18:23.835 --> 18:25.080
for Bring Your Daughter to Work Day.

18:25.160 --> 18:26.725
- Dad, that's what makes it funny.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.760
- I also wanted to give Maeby
a good role model for a change.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.440
Yeah, well, I guess, you looking out for
her is probably something she could use.

18:33.520 --> 18:35.520
Where is Maeby?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.160
<i>Michael realized he had
to get to the police station...</i>

18:38.240 --> 18:42.200
<i>before they got ahold of Maeby, to whom
he'd promised $50 to tell the truth.</i>

18:42.320 --> 18:44.280
I've put a bounty on my own head.

18:44.360 --> 18:48.280
<i>But Maeby's instincts to lie returned.</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:50.200
Hey, you can't go in there.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.840
No, it's okay.
I'm Detective Fellows's daughter.

18:52.960 --> 18:56.920
Oh. Oh, sorry. It's four-three-five.
And that opens any door in the building.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.920
Great. Thanks.

19:04.640 --> 19:08.120
<i>And it was there that Maeby
discovered the key to Michael's freedom.</i>

19:08.200 --> 19:10.040
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

19:10.120 --> 19:12.440
Maeby. What-What-What'd she say?

19:12.520 --> 19:15.000
I said there's a tape of Kitty getting
on the boat and that you guys blew it up.

19:15.080 --> 19:17.760
I told them the truth,
like you told me.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
That-a-girl.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.800
That's right. That's,
uh, that's the truth.

19:21.835 --> 19:23.160
That's everything that we know.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.520
You're free to go.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.480
Great. Here we go.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.960
- What the hell just happened?
- Relax. They got nothing on you.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.680
They're bluffing. Kitty's alive.
I just saw her in the back room.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.600
They just wanted to get you scared,
so you'd testify against Pop-Pop.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.640
Unbelievable. Oh, that's great.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.240
You just told them the truth;
they let us walk.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.560
