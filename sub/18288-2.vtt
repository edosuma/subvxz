00:01.609 --> 00:02.604
I don't wanna break up with you.

00:02.639 --> 00:04.061
You think
we should go to therapy?

00:04.096 --> 00:05.844
Therapy's for people
with problems.

00:07.039 --> 00:09.277
Tell me you never want
to see me again.

00:09.312 --> 00:10.898
I never wanna see you again.

<b>MUSIC</b>

00:12.515 --> 00:14.460
What I want to do now,
Kit, is just to be

00:14.495 --> 00:16.271
a really good
business partner to you

00:16.277 --> 00:19.370
- and this whole night club thing.
- The Hit Club!

00:19.410 --> 00:21.625
- Hit! It's a hit!
- That's a great name for a club.

00:21.669 --> 00:22.772
I'm gonna call William.

00:22.819 --> 00:24.162
Did you hear
what happened with the movie?

00:24.199 --> 00:25.503
- No.
- They'll reshoot the ending.

00:25.538 --> 00:27.972
- To what?
- Jesse goes back to Jim and

00:28.008 --> 00:30.412
decides she isn't
maybe lesbian after all.

00:30.497 --> 00:33.281
I didn't call you
at 2:15 in the morning

00:33.315 --> 00:35.100
to accuse you
of being a sellout.

00:37.457 --> 00:38.442
Oh my God!

00:38.488 --> 00:40.140
You need to fight for Jenny.

00:40.187 --> 00:41.932
You're my best friend
I've ever had

00:41.968 --> 00:44.940
and I'm profoundly ashamed
of what I've done.

00:44.977 --> 00:46.193
It's Jenny. She said:

00:46.197 --> 00:48.193
"If you still wanna
come over and see me, you can".

00:48.298 --> 00:51.881
You're nothing but a self absorbed,
self-indulgent little brat.

00:53.006 --> 00:55.753
And our little feeling on set
was a showmance.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.461
It's time for you to go.

01:05.736 --> 01:07.781
Baby, don't be sad.

01:07.826 --> 01:09.503
It's so boring.

01:09.547 --> 01:10.682
Get off of me!

01:11.575 --> 01:13.820
Who the hell
does she think she is?!

01:13.856 --> 01:16.363
She called me,
she wanted me!

01:16.406 --> 01:19.131
And then she goes all
Paris and Britney on me just like:

01:19.166 --> 01:21.542
"Oh, I never liked you
and it was a showmance!"

01:22.368 --> 01:23.291
<b>MUSIC</b>

01:23.338 --> 01:25.063
Can you believe that?

01:25.818 --> 01:28.243
She fucks me all night long
and then she has the nerve

01:28.286 --> 01:29.833
to say that's a showmance!

01:29.876 --> 01:31.872
I mean, I don't even know
what the fuck that is!

01:31.916 --> 01:33.600
- I'm googling.
- Oh, it's, uh...

01:33.647 --> 01:35.520
Oh, it's, uh...

01:36.475 --> 01:40.360
"Phony romance that happens
during a movie or a TV show"

01:40.407 --> 01:42.530
"usually between two stars,
but it can"

- "also be between a star and"...
- You know what?

01:44.608 --> 01:46.251
I got it, alright?

01:47.176 --> 01:49.840
Do you know how many times
has she said that she loved me?

01:49.885 --> 01:52.513
She's officially a liar
and I officially hate her!

01:52.556 --> 01:54.163
You know what?
Fuck her, alright?!

01:54.205 --> 01:56.943
I got over 16 million
on my opening week end and

01:56.978 --> 01:59.471
<b>she can't even get in at
the premiere of my next movie.</b>

01:59.508 --> 02:00.961
She payed someone.

02:00.967 --> 02:03.303
God! Makes wonder
who broke her heart.

02:03.305 --> 02:06.861
I can't believe she told you
it wasn't you. That was so harsh!

02:06.868 --> 02:09.250
You must feel horrible.

02:10.065 --> 02:11.212
You know what?

02:11.218 --> 02:14.493
You are out of my 5!

02:15.195 --> 02:18.181
- Nikki, you're my best friend!
- No, get out!

02:18.895 --> 02:21.011
Right now! Get out!

gonna get away with this.

- I didn't order that.
- Oh, they're from her.

05:23.026 --> 05:25.161
Jenny, Shane wants you to know

05:25.208 --> 05:27.573
that she made them
especially for you.

05:33.128 --> 05:34.462
Excuse me, Alice?

05:35.788 --> 05:37.443
Do you mind just
mentionning to Shane

05:37.448 --> 05:39.162
that I don't want her waffles?

05:45.177 --> 05:47.541
She doesn't want your waffles.

05:52.906 --> 05:55.201
How much do you love
the New Valley service?

05:55.238 --> 05:58.042
{\a6}Oh, my God, Helena's taking
this place to a whole new level.

06:00.577 --> 06:03.170
Oh, and waffles! Look!
I know that I love waffles.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.371
I'm getting waffles.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.152
{\a6}Or not.

06:11.985 --> 06:14.501
{\a6}Haven't you heard that there are
people starving in this world?

06:14.605 --> 06:16.723
{\a6}I'm sure
they don't want waffles, Kit.

06:21.146 --> 06:23.701
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

06:23.736 --> 06:26.591
Shit! Okay, that's one to one.

06:28.316 --> 06:30.320
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

06:30.358 --> 06:33.473
- Fuck! I always loose.
- 'Cause you're always rock.

06:33.517 --> 06:34.900
- Always.
- Is that what it is?

06:37.528 --> 06:38.631
Have fun with the martyrs.

06:38.668 --> 06:40.210
Have fun with the cheaters.

06:49.768 --> 06:52.202
Wow, everyone's so industrial.

06:52.235 --> 06:53.480
What are you doing?

06:54.336 --> 06:56.610
- Learning.
- I'm writing my new treatment.

06:57.078 --> 06:58.433
What are you writing, Alice?

07:02.018 --> 07:02.850
A treatment.

07:05.028 --> 07:06.252
A treatment for a film?

07:07.305 --> 07:10.993
I just... I had this kinda
killer idea so I thought

07:11.038 --> 07:14.333
I'll just write
a great screenplay and then

07:14.365 --> 07:17.331
sell it for millions
and buy a house in Malibu?

07:17.365 --> 07:19.093
I don't like Malibu.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.970
- You've never been to Malibu.
- I have been there.

07:23.558 --> 07:25.981
I didn't know you wanted
to be a screenwriter.

07:26.018 --> 07:28.022
Well, I mean, you know,
I never really did.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.512
Really, but I thought how hard

07:30.548 --> 07:33.801
can it be? Right? Jenny?
I mean, it's like,

07:33.847 --> 07:35.300
you get paid big time.

07:37.888 --> 07:40.742
Well, if you, if you actually,
Alice, if you would to amortize

07:40.788 --> 07:43.493
the payment of the 17 drafts
that I did on "Lez Girls",

07:43.537 --> 07:46.812
you'll see that you actually
don't get paid very much. So...

07:48.028 --> 07:50.032
Alice is writing a treatment
for a script.

07:50.065 --> 07:51.463
Hope we're not in it.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.061
Amen to that.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.042
Actually,

07:54.235 --> 07:56.942
writing a good screenplay
is what's really hard.

07:56.987 --> 07:59.392
And Jenny's become
a very good screenwriter.

07:59.397 --> 08:00.311
Thank you, Tina.

08:00.415 --> 08:02.023
You should ask her
to read your treatment.

08:04.097 --> 08:05.480
Sure.

08:05.510 --> 08:06.985
Sure, sure, sure.

08:07.789 --> 08:09.642
I would love to give you notes.

08:17.069 --> 08:18.772
What?
I need the carbs for training.

08:18.809 --> 08:22.020
But do you need them that fast?
You have them all over your suit.

08:26.527 --> 08:28.683
Wow, you look amazing.

08:28.715 --> 08:30.841
- Thank you.
- I dressed her.

08:32.047 --> 08:34.490
- Do a little spinzy, come on.
- No.

08:34.535 --> 08:36.780
It's her first day
at the police academy, so...

08:36.815 --> 08:38.172
Excited?

08:38.215 --> 08:39.553
Yeah, I am, actually.

08:39.597 --> 08:42.443
All my friends had the training,
it's really, it's really rough.

08:42.477 --> 08:44.212
I tried to dress her
in my morning, but

08:44.256 --> 08:45.943
she just thought
she looked like a girl.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.521
- It was inappropriate.
- You looked so good in that.

08:48.568 --> 08:51.070
You know it. You just hate
to look good or something.

08:51.117 --> 08:52.640
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

08:53.848 --> 08:55.591
There is like a lack of effort.

08:57.706 --> 08:59.062
Tell me about fashion.

08:59.098 --> 09:00.853
<b>Fashion for...
I don't know.</b>

09:02.618 --> 09:04.691
When you guys are gonna
go to therapy?

09:12.086 --> 09:15.043
There is a thing
called privacy, Alice.

09:22.536 --> 09:23.640
Privacy.

09:23.686 --> 09:26.172
Well, I see you
at Dan Foxworthy's at 6.

09:26.916 --> 09:28.623
There's parking on the...

09:29.295 --> 09:32.041
Wow, look at you!
You look a million dollars!

09:34.466 --> 09:35.772
Fuck, you know?

09:35.807 --> 09:37.092
Bad vibes.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.012
You and Shane should
work your shit out,

09:40.045 --> 09:42.720
'cause this place is becoming
like the black hole of Calcutta.

09:44.937 --> 09:48.621
It's good to see we're still asunder;
nothing like a little

09:48.658 --> 09:50.793
dyke drama
to tear the place out.

09:50.838 --> 09:52.311
That's what I'm saying.

09:52.356 --> 09:54.373
- Bad vibes, man.
- Helena,

09:55.258 --> 09:56.850
why don't you come
and sit with us?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.630
No, I'm

09:58.678 --> 10:00.553
not picking sides, alright?

10:00.586 --> 10:01.891
I love you both.

10:01.927 --> 10:03.070
Going for a run.

10:03.816 --> 10:05.260
Go Swizerland!

10:05.296 --> 10:07.781
- We have some good news.
- Yeah, we have good news.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.273
Yeah, good news.
Do you wanna tell them?

10:11.047 --> 10:12.331
Why don't you tell them?

10:12.377 --> 10:15.591
Bette and I are registered
with three different agencies

10:15.628 --> 10:17.952
and they said the chance of us
getting a baby

10:17.997 --> 10:20.802
within the next six months
is really good.

10:20.838 --> 10:21.713
What?!

10:23.717 --> 10:25.690
- Congratulations.
- And we're starting construction

10:25.738 --> 10:27.840
on the second storey
'cause we need an other bedroom.

10:27.936 --> 10:29.630
But I thought you guys
were talking about selling?

10:29.678 --> 10:31.780
- We're staying.
- We couldn't sell. Not now.

10:31.825 --> 10:35.742
I mean, with the poperty values,
plumbing and everything. So...

10:35.788 --> 10:38.392
When were you gonna tell me
about construction?

10:38.427 --> 10:40.122
We're telling you now.

10:40.156 --> 10:42.253
We have to.
We need a room for the baby.

10:42.286 --> 10:44.910
How am I supposed to write
with all that noise?

10:44.945 --> 10:48.811
I'm sorry, Jenny.
We will do our best not to

10:48.815 --> 10:50.292
disturb you.

10:50.655 --> 10:52.491
But you might wanna get
some earplugs.

10:53.725 --> 10:55.850
I have to get a new roomate.

10:56.358 --> 10:58.110
This is gonna be impossible

10:58.148 --> 11:00.231
- with your racket.
- Jenny, please!

11:00.278 --> 11:02.233
You don't need a new roomate!

11:02.275 --> 11:04.051
You have not spoken to me
in a week.

11:04.087 --> 11:06.270
Would you just talk to me?
I know we can work this out.

11:06.316 --> 11:08.922
Oh, right. So,
you want me to forgive you

11:08.967 --> 11:10.640
because you made me waffles?

11:11.887 --> 11:13.062
Well, why wouldn't you?

11:13.748 --> 11:16.992
Because you create
this trail of destruction

11:17.026 --> 11:19.230
you don't take
any responsibility for it.

11:20.458 --> 11:22.833
Why should you be the only one
that doesn't pay?

11:23.198 --> 11:24.582
I am paying.

11:27.037 --> 11:28.761
You are so full of shit.

11:35.388 --> 11:37.100
The black hole.

11:39.016 --> 11:40.391
- How you're doing?
- Hi, Shane.

11:41.178 --> 11:44.113
So you're putting in those
flower boxes Jenny wanted, huh?

11:46.016 --> 11:48.221
How many more things
you're gonna do for her?

11:48.266 --> 11:49.461
I don't know yet.

11:55.455 --> 11:57.473
There's something wrong
with my computer

11:57.505 --> 11:59.241
and I wondered
if you could fix it.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.791
You know what? I can't 'cause
I'm going to my final consult today.

12:12.145 --> 12:13.973
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

12:15.687 --> 12:18.693
- Alright. Are you ready for this?
- Do it.

12:21.975 --> 12:23.431
I love it.

12:23.478 --> 12:24.753
Love it.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.852
Love it!

12:25.897 --> 12:27.073
We thought you would.

12:27.977 --> 12:29.592
"The Girls", it's so fucking hot.

12:29.628 --> 12:32.382
This thing is gonna make
"Sex in the city" like a Disney movie.

12:32.418 --> 12:36.900
What's "The Girls"?
The movie is called "Lez Girls".

12:37.496 --> 12:39.423
- "Lez".
- I haven't had a chance to

12:39.468 --> 12:41.423
talk to Tina about
the market research.

12:41.455 --> 12:43.413
I'll full you in in a minute.

12:43.447 --> 12:44.782
In the meantime,

12:45.485 --> 12:46.613
why don't you just

12:46.645 --> 12:48.692
give me a briefing
on the release.

12:48.727 --> 12:50.463
After the initial two weeks,
we'll go wide.

12:50.466 --> 12:53.871
We have 2000 screens nation wide
and select cities in here.

12:53.947 --> 12:56.000
- France is gonna eat this up.
- No.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.172
No what?

13:00.857 --> 13:02.220
No way. I am

13:02.267 --> 13:04.861
not gonna let you get away
with this. I'm not gonna

13:04.897 --> 13:06.500
let you market this as some

13:06.537 --> 13:09.071
bullshit boy meets girl
love story!

13:09.116 --> 13:11.810
- That's not what this is!
- It's more than that. It's

13:11.846 --> 13:14.611
boy meets girl,
boy almost looses girl to girl...

13:14.698 --> 13:17.382
But in the end the audience
wants love to prevail.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.711
That's the winner hear. The new ending
tested through the roof.

13:19.758 --> 13:20.891
What?

13:21.467 --> 13:22.543
The new...

13:22.557 --> 13:24.780
What you mean
the new ending tested?

13:24.785 --> 13:26.501
When did you have
a test screening?

13:26.525 --> 13:27.943
Get on board, Tina.

13:27.995 --> 13:30.011
Train's not going to Lezzie town.

13:33.775 --> 13:35.653
This is amazing.

13:35.675 --> 13:39.071
Art General uses the correlation
about how she uses

13:39.105 --> 13:42.572
human emotions like
pieces of scrapped metal,

13:42.617 --> 13:45.472
words like found materials.

13:45.507 --> 13:48.070
It works on so many levels.
I mean, here is the Curator

13:48.116 --> 13:50.502
who told people
their work wasn't worthy.

13:50.535 --> 13:52.673
The gallerist
who wouldn't show an artist

13:52.727 --> 13:55.920
and now the Dean
who rejects applications.

13:55.956 --> 13:57.221
Exactly.

13:57.715 --> 13:59.162
A woman who has

13:59.208 --> 14:02.323
stood in judgment of our art
her entire career

14:02.426 --> 14:05.810
<b>is now being thrust into
the spot light as the art...</b>

14:06.335 --> 14:08.011
It's brilliant.

14:08.557 --> 14:11.540
This kind of praise
is fantastic for our program.

14:12.096 --> 14:13.941
I can guarantee
that we're gonna see...

14:13.996 --> 14:15.433
We could use
the same material throughout

14:15.467 --> 14:17.401
<b>and...</b>

14:17.437 --> 14:19.650
I can't talk right now.
Alright, bye.

14:20.796 --> 14:23.643
Forgive me. I had
the contractors on the phone.

14:23.678 --> 14:25.403
Do you know we're doing
that second storey

14:25.435 --> 14:27.082
on the house for the baby...

14:27.126 --> 14:29.481
Phyllis, would you mind just
finishing what you were saying?

14:29.525 --> 14:31.990
What I was saying was
that based on

14:32.027 --> 14:35.031
C.U. associations with Jodi,
I wouldn't be surprised

14:35.075 --> 14:39.043
if we see a significant increase
in applicants this coming semester.

14:50.915 --> 14:53.553
So one of my goals is to be able
to take my shirt off at the beach

14:53.588 --> 14:54.981
within a year. That's my goal.

14:56.085 --> 14:58.840
Feel my pecs. I've been doing
like 200 pushings today.

14:59.305 --> 15:00.841
Feel like I'm already bigger.
That's awesome.

15:00.868 --> 15:02.931
Very good.
That's very impressive.

15:05.006 --> 15:06.572
Yeah, I think I'm doing good
with the contour.

15:06.595 --> 15:09.412
I just, I hope I grew more chest
to cover the scars.

15:09.457 --> 15:12.042
Well, I think Dr. Stanhouse
is gonna try

15:12.088 --> 15:13.861
to do the key whole procedure
on you?

15:13.957 --> 15:15.151
Yeah, I'm hoping so.

15:15.195 --> 15:18.250
And is your schedule for surgery
on wednesday?

15:18.286 --> 15:19.950
Yeah, he called me this morning
and he said that

15:19.997 --> 15:21.993
as soon as he gets the lab reports
we're gonna be able to...

15:23.796 --> 15:27.073
I'm afraid there's a problem.

15:27.705 --> 15:29.182
What's the problem?

15:31.828 --> 15:32.871
You're pregnant.

15:37.595 --> 15:39.262
No, I can't,
I can't be pregnant.

15:39.297 --> 15:41.333
- No, I've been taking testosterone.
- Have you had intercourse?

15:41.376 --> 15:43.311
Have you and Tom had
unprotected sex?

15:43.328 --> 15:45.641
Yeah, but we've been both
tested for H.I.V.

15:45.688 --> 15:47.023
We've been monogamous.

15:47.057 --> 15:49.750
If you and Tom have had
vaginal sex.

15:49.786 --> 15:52.870
I know you might not
call it that,

15:52.907 --> 15:54.633
but unfortunately,

15:54.677 --> 15:57.023
that doesn't stop it from
working the same way.

15:57.058 --> 16:00.482
Taking testosterone doesn't
shut down the reproductive system.

16:02.358 --> 16:04.080
What about my surgery?

16:06.076 --> 16:08.331
We're gonna have
to postpone your surgery.

16:09.568 --> 16:12.340
We're gonna have to find out
how far along you are and

16:12.838 --> 16:15.733
you're gonna have to decide
what you wanna do about it.

16:18.415 --> 16:20.583
We'll have your budget done
by the end of the week.

16:20.617 --> 16:22.261
We cannot afford to have
the art department

16:22.347 --> 16:23.741
<b>last... again.</b>

16:24.168 --> 16:25.143
Thank you.

16:35.467 --> 16:37.840
Can I ask how she responded?

16:39.068 --> 16:40.243
Our Dean?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.283
How did she respond to the work?

16:50.646 --> 16:53.782
He asks how I responded
to your work.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.093
I don't know.

16:59.057 --> 17:00.551
How did you like the show?

17:07.577 --> 17:08.900
But I can't.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.231
I have paints.

17:18.068 --> 17:19.671
Can I talk to you, please?

17:19.717 --> 17:21.941
Sure, let's go to my office.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.980
I hope
Preston didn't bother you.

17:26.028 --> 17:28.691
<b>He's an old fool
with a... for gossip.</b>

17:28.736 --> 17:30.513
It wasn't really about Preston.
I mean, the truth is

17:30.525 --> 17:33.442
that Jodi's behavior
was completely inappropriate...

17:33.477 --> 17:37.443
Baby, when it comes down to it,
this is all I have to offer you.

17:37.475 --> 17:39.413
- And if you can't love this...
- Joyce!

17:39.458 --> 17:40.753
Cover your junk!

17:40.798 --> 17:41.910
Sorry, Bette.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.340
We reschedule?

17:45.208 --> 17:46.693
Joyce, what are you doing?

17:46.727 --> 17:49.861
You can't just pop out
from behind a plant butt naked.

17:49.896 --> 17:51.272
We have rules here.

17:51.306 --> 17:54.921
I checked first to make sure
you didn't have anything.

17:54.958 --> 17:57.082
I was acting with my heart.

17:57.128 --> 17:59.071
I'm a woman in love.

17:59.108 --> 18:01.472
<b>Please, take a lot of.</b>

18:05.837 --> 18:07.080
Phyllis

18:07.115 --> 18:08.553
Eleonore

18:08.597 --> 18:11.060
Victoria Kroll,

18:11.096 --> 18:13.072
you are one hell of a woman.

18:13.108 --> 18:15.223
While the law
in the state of California

18:15.226 --> 18:17.701
continues to acknowledge our love,

18:17.787 --> 18:20.211
I would like to ask you
to take my hand

18:20.245 --> 18:22.372
in holy matrimony.

18:34.825 --> 18:37.052
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes.

18:37.736 --> 18:39.760
- How many carats is this?
- Four!

18:40.097 --> 18:41.890
- Say yes!
- How much did you spend?

18:41.935 --> 18:44.472
- This must have cost a fortune.
- I've got a friend who has a friend...

18:44.496 --> 18:47.011
Say yes, Phyllis, please.

18:48.065 --> 18:50.883
But I said I never wanted
to get married again.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.440
We'll go to San Fransisco,

18:52.447 --> 18:54.543
<b>we'll get married on...
of City Hall,</b>

18:54.636 --> 18:56.472
Gavin said he'd marry us.

18:56.507 --> 18:58.343
Gavin Newsom?

18:58.805 --> 19:01.393
- The mayor of San Fransisco?
- That's right.

19:01.438 --> 19:03.281
We raised
a lot of money for that guy.

19:04.886 --> 19:06.621
Say yes, Phyllis.

19:08.125 --> 19:09.081
I'm freezing.

19:18.005 --> 19:21.972
- Yes.
- Damn, lady! Come here, you!

19:24.736 --> 19:26.772
You've made me
one happy woman.

19:37.035 --> 19:38.720
<b>MUSIC</b>

19:38.738 --> 19:40.331
Who wants to tell me
why you're here?

19:40.366 --> 19:41.983
Oh, we're just here
for a tune-up.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.641
Does that seem like an accurate
assessment to you, Tasha?

19:44.685 --> 19:47.182
She's the one who called it that.
We've just had a couple of little,

19:47.218 --> 19:48.853
little things come up lately.

19:50.007 --> 19:52.392
- What sorts of little things?
- Money,

19:52.438 --> 19:54.023
I make a lot more
than she does.

19:56.555 --> 19:58.293
How's that make you feel, Tasha?

19:58.328 --> 19:59.531
Resentful.

19:59.576 --> 20:01.832
She doesn't want me
to spend this much because

20:01.865 --> 20:03.043
she can't afford it.

20:04.398 --> 20:06.842
- Is that true?
- Absolutely.

20:06.878 --> 20:08.823
We couldn't even get
a bigger appartment because

20:08.867 --> 20:10.682
she couldn't share the rent
fifty-fifty.

20:10.717 --> 20:12.290
And I also think she resents me

20:12.337 --> 20:14.101
because I don't clean
as much as she does.

20:16.097 --> 20:17.290
Do you?

20:18.735 --> 20:20.141
Oh, look, now she's mad.

20:24.068 --> 20:25.623
Is there anything else?

20:26.655 --> 20:28.491
Tasha broke up with me
last week.

20:30.048 --> 20:31.383
Really?

20:31.428 --> 20:33.633
Why did you break up
with Alice, Tasha?

20:33.688 --> 20:35.183
Because she thought I cheated

20:35.216 --> 20:36.673
when I didn't even
kiss the girl.

20:42.045 --> 20:43.691
Did you

20:43.735 --> 20:45.160
think about it?

20:46.278 --> 20:48.412
Yeah, but, I mean,
she wouldn't have even known

20:48.448 --> 20:50.451
if I didn't tell her.
So I think that mere fact

20:50.488 --> 20:53.873
that I disclosed the information
should count to something.

20:54.538 --> 20:56.833
- Right?
- But if you knew Tasha's feelings

20:56.906 --> 20:58.801
about the subject of cheating,

20:59.556 --> 21:01.340
why did you choose
to tell her?

21:02.197 --> 21:03.820
I think we're past it.

21:06.655 --> 21:09.391
- I think what we have to work...
- Alice,

21:09.856 --> 21:12.393
this is called couples' therapy
for a reason.

21:13.877 --> 21:16.741
Now, Tasha, this process
works much more effectively

21:16.745 --> 21:18.120
if you participate.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.090
Why do you think
Alice told you?

21:30.598 --> 21:32.143
She doesn't even wanna be here.

21:35.827 --> 21:39.443
I think that she told me because
she wanted to break up with me

21:39.486 --> 21:42.870
and bringing this woman between us
was the easiest way to do that.

21:42.906 --> 21:45.002
She knew how I felt,
she knew that

21:45.048 --> 21:47.842
I would break up with her
and when I did, she got scared.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.492
That's why we're here.

21:57.505 --> 21:59.111
Can I help you?

21:59.666 --> 22:02.102
Uh, yes, I have an appointment?

22:02.138 --> 22:04.391
<b>I called in earlier?</b>

22:11.417 --> 22:14.402
Hi, I'm Max Sweeney.
I have an appointment.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.961
- For your girlfriend, or...
- No.

22:16.995 --> 22:18.933
It's for me.
I need an abortion.

22:18.976 --> 22:20.980
- What did he say?
- If this is your idea of a joke

22:21.026 --> 22:21.840
it's not funny.

22:22.878 --> 22:25.052
I'm not joking, alright?
I'm pregnant.

22:25.097 --> 22:28.131
Sir, if you don't leave now,
I'm gonna have to call the security.

22:28.165 --> 22:31.341
Look, I'm a F.T.M. transsexual,
alright?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.931
Yeah, that's right!
Take a good look!

22:36.975 --> 22:39.073
I'm a man and I'm pregnant.

22:39.117 --> 22:41.800
It happens. Don't you read
the fucking tabloids?!

22:42.995 --> 22:44.953
Can I have my appointment now,
please?

22:46.245 --> 22:47.711
- "Run Run" by Those Dancing Days -

23:10.547 --> 23:12.111
I'm trying to write.

23:21.458 --> 23:22.831
Can I have my keys?

23:43.578 --> 23:45.353
I promise

23:45.908 --> 23:48.563
to make room in the appartment
for your things.

23:52.577 --> 23:54.253
And um,

23:54.297 --> 23:57.803
I promise to try to see things
through your point of view.

23:57.836 --> 24:02.143
And to not talk to you
with so much judgment.

24:03.377 --> 24:06.272
And tomorrow when I wake up,

24:06.308 --> 24:09.110
for work,
I'm gonna make you breakfeast.

24:13.156 --> 24:14.672
I love that!

24:14.708 --> 24:16.413
It's good, right?

24:16.458 --> 24:17.880
Yeah, I know, it's good.

24:20.057 --> 24:23.671
So, um, are you gonna give us
more exercizes or...?

24:25.007 --> 24:27.171
I mean, maybe some homework.
I think we're ready for some homework.

24:27.256 --> 24:29.403
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm ready. Bring in on.

24:30.568 --> 24:32.162
I'm not gonna give you
homework.

24:33.378 --> 24:35.781
I don't think you two
should be in therapy.

24:36.367 --> 24:38.812
- That's what I said. See?
- We rock.

24:40.908 --> 24:43.110
You two have
so little in common.

24:43.816 --> 24:46.270
I really don't think
you belong together.

24:49.305 --> 24:51.123
I mean, what the fuck?

24:52.076 --> 24:53.703
It's like, we spent what,

24:54.138 --> 24:56.971
55 minutes with this guy?

24:57.556 --> 24:58.873
Where is he fucking go off?

24:58.916 --> 25:02.241
- I told you. Therapy's bullshit.
- It's bullshit, you're right.

25:02.285 --> 25:05.000
He knows nothing about what we do
and don't have in common.

25:05.028 --> 25:07.841
What the hell is he talking about?
We don't have anything in common.

25:07.878 --> 25:09.680
- Really? Dan?
- I know, it's crazy.

25:09.697 --> 25:11.460
- Give me my helmet.
- I don't know.

25:11.507 --> 25:12.560
Thank you.

25:13.095 --> 25:14.183
Upsetting.

25:18.628 --> 25:19.853
I'll see you tonight?

- "Flava In Ya Ear" by Craig Mack -

25:28.016 --> 25:29.013
Come here.

26:04.305 --> 26:05.962
Hey, are you okay? Sorry,

26:06.017 --> 26:07.420
I couldn't get any sooner.

26:07.455 --> 26:08.921
Should you be op already?

26:08.967 --> 26:10.092
They wouldn't do it.

26:10.138 --> 26:11.793
I'm too far along already.

26:11.827 --> 26:13.880
- How far along?
- Four months.

26:13.915 --> 26:15.860
How did this happen?

26:16.555 --> 26:18.313
How the fuck do you think
it happened?!

26:19.167 --> 26:20.913
But, I didn't think you could.
You've been...

26:20.946 --> 26:22.512
Yeah, I thought
if I was seeking testosterone,

26:22.518 --> 26:24.401
I couldn't get pregnant, okay?
I was wrong.

26:24.457 --> 26:26.521
Why wouldn't your doctor
tell you something like that?

26:26.567 --> 26:27.672
I don't know.

26:27.717 --> 26:29.371
Maybe because she didn't think
I was stupid enough

26:29.418 --> 26:32.471
- to let some faggot fuck me!
- Hey, fuck you! Don't blame this on me!

26:33.526 --> 26:36.140
Who the hell am I
supposed to blame, huh?

26:36.188 --> 26:38.480
Who the hell has his dick
been inside me?

26:38.496 --> 26:39.923
How am I supposed to know?

26:43.237 --> 26:45.661
You got me pregnant, you faggot!
It was you!

27:02.015 --> 27:03.852
I can't do this, Max.

27:05.046 --> 27:06.543
I'm not ready.

27:07.887 --> 27:09.150
- "Great DJ" by The Ting Tings -

27:14.777 --> 27:17.692
We gotta make a list.
Clear the desk.

27:19.085 --> 27:20.541
What kind of a list?

27:20.586 --> 27:22.012
Pros and cons list.

27:23.028 --> 27:25.182
My mother used to make this
all the time

27:25.228 --> 27:28.012
to kinda decide whether she's
gonna divorce her ex-husbands.

27:28.047 --> 27:30.031
And that's the model
we're gonna follow?

27:30.988 --> 27:33.501
Well, she had
very successful divorces.

27:37.447 --> 27:38.562
Pro.

27:41.965 --> 27:44.262
Hold on.
Why con gotta be black though?

27:45.927 --> 27:49.453
It's not a race thing.
It's just...

27:49.796 --> 27:52.203
Red is happy.
Red is like pro...

27:52.246 --> 27:54.102
No, red represents the devil.

27:56.728 --> 27:57.613
Fine.

27:58.457 --> 28:00.621
I'm writing down
"color weirdness" .

28:12.027 --> 28:14.652
The work is really good
but the show is uneven.

28:15.158 --> 28:17.953
This is, uh... This is weird.

28:17.995 --> 28:19.002
I think it's weird.

28:24.887 --> 28:26.401
Hey,
someone spent some money, huh?

28:26.435 --> 28:28.090
Yes,
she's spent a small fortune.

28:28.127 --> 28:29.071
Really?

28:29.116 --> 28:30.862
God, I would kill
to have a piece like this

28:30.898 --> 28:32.291
when I have my own gallery.

28:33.066 --> 28:33.973
Me too.

28:36.338 --> 28:38.292
Do you know
who Kelly Wentworth is?

28:38.327 --> 28:40.642
A rich divorcée.

28:41.248 --> 28:45.253
She walked away with 80 million
dollars of Dick Wentworth's fortune.

28:45.296 --> 28:46.602
And decided to spend it

28:46.676 --> 28:48.980
on making herself a presence
in the art world.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.042
Do you like my vanity project?

28:53.128 --> 28:55.101
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.

28:56.285 --> 28:58.643
Oh, it was 89 million.

29:03.237 --> 29:05.701
Bette Porter?
Kelly Wentworth.

29:05.746 --> 29:06.850
Please to meet you.

29:07.845 --> 29:10.490
It's really a spectacular space.

29:10.527 --> 29:12.402
You've been here a long time?

29:13.066 --> 29:14.742
You really don't remember me?

29:17.805 --> 29:21.270
Juicy fucking Freemont?!
Jesus!

29:21.305 --> 29:23.472
Oh my God!

29:25.545 --> 29:27.521
I swear to fucking God,

29:27.556 --> 29:29.483
you look better
than you did in college.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.090
- Bitch!
- Look at that biatch!

29:31.126 --> 29:33.412
- The blond looks so good on you.
- Thank you.

29:34.435 --> 29:36.383
Look at your body.

29:36.417 --> 29:37.632
Are you still a runner?

29:39.567 --> 29:42.211
I mean, sometimes.
Not, not really often.

29:43.297 --> 29:45.911
God, what the hell
are you doing in L.A.?

29:45.988 --> 29:47.973
I thought you were married
to New York forever.

29:47.987 --> 29:51.263
Well, I thought I was married
to Dick Wentworth forever.

29:54.716 --> 29:56.831
Holy fucking shit!

29:56.865 --> 29:59.951
I'm so, so happy to see you.

30:06.435 --> 30:10.642
Oh my God... Oh, God, I'm sorry.
This is Tina Kennard, my partner.

30:11.677 --> 30:13.671
- Hello.
- Still gay, hey, Porter?

30:13.716 --> 30:16.150
Yeah, well, I lack of imagination
in some areas.

30:16.188 --> 30:17.431
Not many.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.171
This is Kelly Frimont.

30:22.748 --> 30:24.352
The Kelly Frimont!

30:24.385 --> 30:27.613
Oh, Kelly Frimont,
the college roomate!

30:27.645 --> 30:28.931
Right.

30:28.978 --> 30:31.262
Well, I've heard a lot about you.

30:31.298 --> 30:33.411
Did you tell Tina
about you and me?

30:34.146 --> 30:36.053
Well, I told her that you

30:36.097 --> 30:38.582
let me kiss you once
and were so ceased

30:38.617 --> 30:40.621
by a deep and abiding
homosexual panic

30:40.685 --> 30:42.401
that you moved out of the house
immadiately.

30:42.445 --> 30:44.293
She got over me in two minutes.

30:44.327 --> 30:45.150
Ten.

30:48.495 --> 30:51.432
This piece is beautiful.

30:51.466 --> 30:53.453
- I know.
- You have great taste.

30:53.488 --> 30:55.042
I love the tonality.

30:55.845 --> 30:58.882
I just ordered a roadster in

30:59.227 --> 31:00.572
this colour.

31:02.375 --> 31:03.393
I did!

31:10.328 --> 31:12.733
Well, we're gonna go
see the rest of the show.

31:12.797 --> 31:14.983
Okay, but, don't leave

31:15.016 --> 31:16.512
without saying goodbye.

31:16.548 --> 31:17.721
- I will.
- We will.

31:22.438 --> 31:24.051
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

31:31.025 --> 31:32.723
-"Killalady" by Justine Electra -

31:32.767 --> 31:35.292
There is way more cons
than pros.

31:49.758 --> 31:51.432
Alright, let's say this,

31:51.468 --> 31:53.371
like "doesn't cook with pepper"

31:53.417 --> 31:54.412
ever,

31:54.925 --> 31:55.832
right?

31:55.867 --> 31:58.512
It, uh, it shouldn't be,
it shouldn't count

31:58.545 --> 31:59.943
as many points as, like,

31:59.985 --> 32:01.801
"makes me wanna be
a better person".

32:01.837 --> 32:02.940
Right?

32:02.985 --> 32:04.481
It's pretty good.

32:04.528 --> 32:06.310
So we should do it
on a point system.

32:06.358 --> 32:07.492
Like,

32:07.535 --> 32:11.382
"doesn't cook with pepper"
should get what, two points, and...

32:11.425 --> 32:14.143
- Like a point system?
- Yeah, like a point system exactly.

32:14.155 --> 32:17.443
And then "is spontaneous",
I just pick that one 'cause I,

32:17.476 --> 32:19.480
I really appreciate that
about you.

32:25.576 --> 32:27.363
"Likes to get spanked"
you should add.

32:29.927 --> 32:32.870
Okay,
this would get like 8 points.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.731
Okay, that is so smart.

32:35.735 --> 32:38.423
Very smart. I mean,
you're smart. You're smart.

32:38.507 --> 32:39.781
Give me this.

32:45.226 --> 32:47.732
- How many points?
- Oh, nine. You get 9.

32:48.945 --> 32:50.883
Oh yeah,
the pros are so winning now.

32:56.028 --> 32:59.461
So, call me and
we'll arrange a studio visit.

33:04.627 --> 33:07.440
Just one of the many things
I love about the art world.

33:07.487 --> 33:09.590
Yeah, well,
he's a terrible artist.

33:09.637 --> 33:12.183
Luckily I'm not interested
in his work.

33:14.357 --> 33:16.881
Oh, you guys aren't going,
are you?

33:17.805 --> 33:18.872
- Yeah, we are.
- Yeah.

33:18.905 --> 33:22.021
Well, we have to make a plan,
lunch, diner, whatever.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.471
I really wanna pick
that brain of yours.

33:24.518 --> 33:26.063
Yeah, well, the first thing
I would tell you

33:26.107 --> 33:28.130
is not to sign an artist
that you wanna fuck.

33:28.166 --> 33:30.230
That comes
from firsthand experience?

33:30.287 --> 33:31.751
I read your
article on the Art Journal.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.723
- It was amazing.
- Oh, thank you!

33:40.787 --> 33:41.913
Do you mind?

33:41.956 --> 33:43.503
No, I think you should.

33:43.548 --> 33:45.153
Excuse me.

33:45.665 --> 33:46.721
Just a second.

33:46.766 --> 33:48.823
The cover? Incredible.

33:48.865 --> 33:50.441
I loved your lips.

33:53.337 --> 33:54.902
I need to talk to you.

33:57.216 --> 33:58.301
I'm sorry.

34:00.826 --> 34:02.062
Just a second.

34:14.456 --> 34:15.351
Now what?

34:15.357 --> 34:17.531
James has been trying to
schedule an appointment with you

34:17.574 --> 34:19.199
and you haven't
come back to him.

34:19.955 --> 34:21.330
I've been busy.

34:23.068 --> 34:25.021
Do you realise
that you report to me?

34:25.068 --> 34:27.181
And if I ask to see you,

34:27.216 --> 34:28.802
then you make it happen.

34:28.846 --> 34:30.371
I don't report to you, Bette.

34:30.407 --> 34:32.340
I don't report to anybody.

34:34.036 --> 34:35.683
You have until tomorrow.

34:35.717 --> 34:36.850
Or what?

34:36.897 --> 34:38.840
<b>I knew about it
if I couldn't choose my T.A.</b>

34:38.875 --> 34:42.409
I saw her. It was like
one after the next, little

34:42.458 --> 34:45.922
moths to a flame.
She burnt everyone of them.

34:45.955 --> 34:47.891
- Really?
- You know.

34:48.998 --> 34:49.880
You're ready?

34:53.387 --> 34:55.722
- It was really great to see you.
- You too.

34:55.757 --> 34:57.163
- You too.
- Good luck with the gallery.

34:57.205 --> 34:58.890
Thank you. I'll see you soon.

35:01.736 --> 35:02.813
Nice to meet you.

35:06.045 --> 35:08.292
<b>MUSIC</b>

35:10.095 --> 35:11.810
Yeah, you two are a great pair.

35:11.847 --> 35:13.452
No alcohol, no sex. It's...

35:13.496 --> 35:14.700
Well, that's what you have to do

35:14.735 --> 35:16.331
to keep your sanity and

35:16.368 --> 35:18.582
not to mention your shirt on
in this business.

35:18.638 --> 35:21.750
But, I mean, I'm not a complete nun.
I have the occasional drink.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.482
I even have sex
every now and then.

35:23.566 --> 35:24.993
Alright,
just not with people you like?

35:25.065 --> 35:26.781
Yeah, that's my new M.O.

35:26.828 --> 35:28.853
All business, no attachment.

35:37.258 --> 35:39.351
What the fuck?

35:40.546 --> 35:41.541
What?

35:42.626 --> 35:43.970
Twelve o'clock,

35:44.005 --> 35:45.843
the female
in the lesbo sandwich.

35:45.886 --> 35:49.143
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!

35:49.177 --> 35:51.600
Dylan, did she come out
of the closet?

35:53.375 --> 35:55.180
That girl used to be straight?

35:55.226 --> 35:58.113
Well, she wasn't gay back
when she was fucking Helena.

36:02.575 --> 36:06.040
Wow, looks like someone's carpet
is about to get munched.

36:07.237 --> 36:08.272
You're okay?

36:09.175 --> 36:10.490
Of course,

36:10.527 --> 36:12.131
why wouldn't I be?

36:12.718 --> 36:14.243
You're not freaking out?

36:14.815 --> 36:18.241
- No, there's no reason to.
- But that's the woman

36:18.275 --> 36:20.453
who extorted you for
sexually harassing her!

36:21.728 --> 36:23.420
What is wrong with you?

36:23.497 --> 36:24.643
I'm just saying.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.861
Of all the gin joints
in all the world?

36:50.358 --> 36:51.510
I've been calling you.

36:52.957 --> 36:54.181
I know.

36:56.406 --> 36:57.801
My phone broke.

37:05.626 --> 37:08.153
I wanted to say I'm sorry
for the way I reacted.

37:10.088 --> 37:12.012
You just caught me by surprise.
I...

37:13.367 --> 37:14.881
I've started to think
about it.

37:19.835 --> 37:21.501
What do you think about
having the baby?

37:24.417 --> 37:25.772
Fuck off!

37:26.276 --> 37:29.101
Don't you wanna be a couple
of West Hollywood fag dads?

37:32.386 --> 37:34.172
I don't know.

37:37.468 --> 37:39.422
How we're fucking handle this?

37:40.598 --> 37:41.700
We can handle it.

37:43.317 --> 37:45.653
We can.
We both make a decent living.

37:46.605 --> 37:48.002
We love each other.

37:48.045 --> 37:50.530
We've said we want
to spend our lives together.

37:54.596 --> 37:56.382
I'll have to think about it.

38:03.017 --> 38:04.763
Sorry I kicked you in the balls.

38:07.046 --> 38:08.421
I'm sorry I knocked you up.

38:18.007 --> 38:20.920
Oh my God,
she was so irritating.

38:20.956 --> 38:22.673
Did you hear her?

38:23.268 --> 38:24.991
"Look at your body"!

38:25.806 --> 38:27.361
"Are you still a runner"?

38:28.036 --> 38:29.152
While you were talking to Jodi,

38:29.158 --> 38:30.753
she asked me
if you were still a player.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.733
I was never a player.

38:32.778 --> 38:34.153
That's not what Kelly said.

38:34.485 --> 38:37.260
She said no matter whether
you're in a relationship or not,

38:37.308 --> 38:40.320
you've always had at least
two other women on the side.

38:40.357 --> 38:43.051
Kelly was too busy
fucking every male professor

38:43.086 --> 38:45.351
to pay attention to
what I was doing.

38:45.786 --> 38:47.560
Oh and another thing,
she's sorry

38:47.596 --> 38:50.811
she didn't take you up
on that offer 20 years ago.

38:52.958 --> 38:54.793
Did you tell her we're exclusive?

38:54.826 --> 38:56.803
No, I didn't, Bette.

38:56.845 --> 39:01.080
I figured if some gorgeous woman
from your past come along,

39:01.128 --> 39:03.153
talking about how hot you are

39:03.197 --> 39:05.663
and how sorry she is
she didn't sleep with you,

39:06.248 --> 39:07.752
I'm not gonna be the one

39:07.787 --> 39:10.143
to tell her that you're not
available for a redo.

39:10.576 --> 39:12.030
But you know that I'm not.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.580
But you were flirting.

39:17.527 --> 39:19.042
I was not flirting.

39:23.055 --> 39:24.413
Yes, you were.

39:24.967 --> 39:26.291
You can't help it.

39:26.827 --> 39:29.343
- What? You never flirt?
- Of course I flirt,

39:29.385 --> 39:32.023
but it's different for you.
It feeds you.

39:33.456 --> 39:35.330
You feed off people wanting you.

39:35.376 --> 39:37.403
And they do want you.

39:38.346 --> 39:41.553
It's...
It's like blood to a vampire.

39:41.585 --> 39:43.551
So now, I'm a vampire?

39:46.016 --> 39:48.380
I love you.
I don't wanna deprive you

39:48.425 --> 39:51.250
of something that's
so fundamental to who you are.

39:56.615 --> 39:58.201
You need to trust

39:58.765 --> 40:00.870
that I know who I am.

40:02.697 --> 40:04.651
And I know what to do with it.

40:06.238 --> 40:08.082
I don't know what that means.

40:18.256 --> 40:21.262
It means that
everyone else can fuck off

40:22.738 --> 40:24.803
because I only want you.

40:41.835 --> 40:43.623
I only wanna be wanted by you.

40:48.188 --> 40:49.561
<b>MUSIC</b>

41:09.058 --> 41:10.420
Thank you.

41:17.086 --> 41:18.260
Thank you, gorgeous.

41:18.306 --> 41:21.393
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

41:39.816 --> 41:41.021
You're with me?

41:41.048 --> 41:42.860
- What? What are we gonna do?
- Get my back.

41:44.696 --> 41:46.291
What did she do to Helena?

41:46.368 --> 41:49.440
Wait a minute. Right now,
I wanna tell her

41:49.475 --> 41:51.773
where she gets off
messing with my friend.

41:51.816 --> 41:53.063
I'm gonna tell her.

41:53.096 --> 41:54.410
I'm so telling her.

42:01.518 --> 42:02.972
Really...

42:03.727 --> 42:05.930
- Really?
- Excuse me?

42:05.978 --> 42:09.490
I mean, come on, the hair.
The hair... and the documentaries!

42:10.566 --> 42:12.070
It's like...

42:12.146 --> 42:15.892
I'm... not... gay!

42:20.735 --> 42:23.001
Yeah, it's a good one.
A good one.

42:23.047 --> 42:24.120
I got this.

42:25.518 --> 42:26.651
She's got it.

42:34.588 --> 42:36.500
You look, you look amazing.

42:42.386 --> 42:44.032
Can we talk?

42:45.065 --> 42:47.630
Okay, so basically,
that skankful Dylan Moreland

42:47.667 --> 42:49.273
almost ruined
entire Helena's life.

42:49.306 --> 42:51.613
First, she pretended
to be in love with her, okay?

42:51.657 --> 42:53.502
So she and her boyfriend
could sue her

42:53.565 --> 42:55.001
for sexual harassment

42:55.036 --> 42:57.161
and extort million of dollars
from her.

42:57.237 --> 42:59.031
Hi, we were...
Sorry, dude, we just left.

43:01.016 --> 43:03.193
- Can you believe it?
- Get me a Pellegrino.

43:04.917 --> 43:05.940
So,

43:06.677 --> 43:08.702
are you aware that
this is my club?

43:08.757 --> 43:10.540
No, I just came back into town

43:10.578 --> 43:13.872
and, I mean, I heard that
this was the best girl club in L.A.

43:13.905 --> 43:18.322
And you were looking for
a girl club, a lesbian girl club?

43:19.617 --> 43:21.641
Yes, I mean, you know.
Obviously,

43:21.686 --> 43:23.831
you, you helped me with that.

43:24.375 --> 43:26.463
I mean, I finally
figured it out, right?

43:26.498 --> 43:27.670
Good.

43:30.876 --> 43:32.240
I just...

43:33.337 --> 43:35.790
I can't begin to tell you about

43:35.836 --> 43:38.361
how sorry I am
about everything, about

43:38.406 --> 43:40.882
the way I behave,
the way I treated you.

43:41.528 --> 43:43.743
And I don't expect for you
to care about my life at all

43:43.778 --> 43:44.923
right now. I...

43:46.475 --> 43:49.770
I certainly don't expect for you
to care that I've,

43:49.818 --> 43:51.682
I've never stopped thinking
about you.

43:51.727 --> 43:52.880
Ever.

43:52.927 --> 43:54.880
And wishing that I'd met you

43:54.917 --> 43:56.530
at a different time in my life.

44:00.748 --> 44:03.223
I can go if you want me to go.

44:05.178 --> 44:07.610
No, it's fine. Look,
I only came over

44:07.657 --> 44:09.182
because it would be
akward for me

44:09.226 --> 44:11.803
not to say anything,
especially since it's my club.

44:11.837 --> 44:15.562
Stay, stay, have a good time.
Enjoy it. Be with your friends.

44:22.925 --> 44:25.562
So, her mother get so mad

44:25.606 --> 44:27.711
she cuts Helena off,
so she has to come live with me

44:27.765 --> 44:29.771
- and become a cook!
- I was a caterer.

44:29.807 --> 44:31.600
Which was a disaster,
and let's face it

44:31.647 --> 44:34.072
Helena is used to
a certain standard of living.

44:34.075 --> 44:36.612
So she meets
this shady high-roller lady.

44:36.658 --> 44:37.931
they hook up but

44:38.016 --> 44:39.881
she uses Helena
and takes all her money

44:39.918 --> 44:42.363
and when Helena takes it back, and
we still don't know where she buried it,

44:42.436 --> 44:44.930
she gets arrested
and has to share a cell

44:44.968 --> 44:46.432
with some killer!

44:46.476 --> 44:48.580
- She was in for text fraud.
- Alright.

44:48.626 --> 44:49.972
So, her mother
can't take it anymore,

44:50.015 --> 44:51.201
she bails Helena out,

44:51.245 --> 44:53.401
but she doesn't wanna live under
her mother's thumb anymore.

44:53.435 --> 44:56.043
So she springs Dusty from jail,
they go to Tahaa

44:56.085 --> 44:57.881
which she doesn't ever
want to talk about,

44:57.928 --> 44:59.542
so it couldn't have been
that great, right? 

44:59.997 --> 45:00.831
Right.

45:00.868 --> 45:04.281
And her mother gets stung by
a jellyfish, all because of this woman.

45:04.927 --> 45:06.443
Want me to kick her ass?

45:08.435 --> 45:09.343
Thank you.

45:09.387 --> 45:11.641
You're a better person that me.
I'd have to beat a bitch down

45:11.675 --> 45:14.441
- if she tried to do that shit to me.
- Are you okay?

45:19.786 --> 45:21.093
I'm perfect.

45:22.628 --> 45:24.270
And don't even get me started
on her kids,

45:24.278 --> 45:25.593
'cause where did they go?

45:38.015 --> 45:40.710
I don't give a fuck
who's idea it was.

45:40.758 --> 45:43.971
You took part. You manipulated
my emotions, you used me,

45:44.017 --> 45:45.790
and you humiliated me,
and you've got

45:45.837 --> 45:48.481
to be fucking insane thinking
you could just prance in here

45:48.525 --> 45:51.101
act as if nothing ever happened,
tell me that you're happy,

45:51.146 --> 45:54.483
tell me that you're out of the closet,
tell me that you're oh so sorry

45:54.517 --> 45:56.810
for destroying my fucking life.

45:57.375 --> 45:58.411
Fuck you!

46:03.018 --> 46:04.012
Thank you!

46:08.037 --> 46:09.591
Now I know you care.

46:28.358 --> 46:30.391
I need my stuff. Open the door.

46:45.846 --> 46:46.860
Thanks.

47:04.027 --> 47:06.380
So that's it?
You're done trying?

47:06.428 --> 47:07.852
I'm out.

47:08.418 --> 47:10.050
I don't see
the point with you anymore.

47:12.918 --> 47:15.321
Shane, you know
that it was you, right?

47:16.517 --> 47:19.080
When I said that
you broke my heart?

47:19.886 --> 47:21.771
I was talking about you.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.742
- "From the Valley to the Stars"
by El Perro Del Mar -

47:27.087 --> 47:29.570
You know, when I said it
I felt like my,

47:29.616 --> 47:31.881
my, my heart was breaking.

47:50.585 --> 47:52.453
I tried to tell you

47:53.266 --> 47:55.422
all week how sorry I am.

48:01.408 --> 48:04.450
I'm not ever gonna hurt you
like that again.

48:05.798 --> 48:08.602
I also realized
that I'm in love with you.

48:13.525 --> 48:15.893
Now I'm like
all those stupid girls.

48:34.878 --> 48:35.892
What?

48:37.517 --> 48:38.573
What?!

49:17.337 --> 49:18.980
titelilie
www.forom.com

49:24.598 --> 49:27.162
The negative was stolen
from the lab, Tina!

49:27.198 --> 49:28.421
We have no more film!

49:28.515 --> 49:30.352
And I'm holding you
personally responsible for it.

49:30.398 --> 49:32.850
Jenny, I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

49:32.886 --> 49:35.431
<i>On the next all new episode of
"The L Word"...</i>

49:35.465 --> 49:37.361
Homophobia is alive and well.

49:37.816 --> 49:40.063
- I'm gotta get fired.
- You don't always get rewarded

49:40.097 --> 49:41.933
for doing the right thing.
I got punished.

49:41.967 --> 49:44.133
Are you really gonna
make this about you right now?

49:44.178 --> 49:45.553
I'm gonna have to fire you.

49:45.597 --> 49:47.471
Having her around makes you
uncomfortable.

49:47.485 --> 49:49.191
That's sexual harassment.

49:49.235 --> 49:51.230
Are you threatening to sue me
for sexual harassment?

49:51.546 --> 49:53.673
- We're making a mistake?
- No.

49:53.708 --> 49:56.330
I don't have expectations
for our relationship.

49:58.538 --> 49:59.772
Oh my God!

50:01.088 --> 50:02.893
So you guys are like a couple?
