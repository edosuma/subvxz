03:52.274 --> 03:54.823
Add a bit more shadow.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.950
But it looks very nice, Ineke.
Yes.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.872
- How are things going, Ellen?
- I'm a bit stuck.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.584
Just focus a bit more
on the vanishing point.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.384
- It is perfect... Very nice.
- Yes.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.803
Yes.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.055
Okay. Nice.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.962
We have arrived.

05:42.008 --> 05:43.885
Grandma.

06:19.421 --> 06:23.767
- Serge how about this one?
- No, too much hair.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.360
- And this one?
- Oh, no, way too ugly.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.159
Excuse me.

15:47.238 --> 15:50.913
Do you happen to be that girl
from the Crystal White commercial?

15:50.992 --> 15:52.710
Yes, but...

15:53.327 --> 15:56.501
Please keep it a secret
for everyone else.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.757
Yes.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.176
Well, then.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.872
Grandma, watch over me.

25:37.411 --> 25:39.834
Hey, over there.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.565
Excuse me, Rubysan.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.645
Rubysan.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.450
- Listen, over there in the Woods...
- Shut up.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.721
Meguchan...

29:22.135 --> 29:23.853
Meguchan!

33:14.701 --> 33:16.203
Meguchan!

33:51.154 --> 33:52.827
Grandma...

34:01.039 --> 34:04.168
You must have been
so awfully lonely.

34:04.251 --> 34:06.800
The agony
you had to go through.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.130
I'm so sorry.

34:11.216 --> 34:17.018
I loved you so much, grandma,
but I had reached my limit.

34:17.097 --> 34:20.271
I couldn't bear it any longer.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.029
Grandma...
I had to abandon you.

34:25.522 --> 34:27.945
What have I done?

34:38.702 --> 34:42.127
Grandma, I'm truly sorry.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.051
Let's go.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.608
- Rubysan!
- Takashi! What happened?

42:40.683 --> 42:43.812
I'm glad everyone is safe.
Rubysan, I know what we need to do.

42:43.895 --> 42:46.648
- What are you saying? I don't understand...
- We're going to be fine.

43:35.071 --> 43:36.823
What's going on here,
Rubysan?

43:52.797 --> 43:55.095
Ruby, I'm sure this is Hell.

43:55.174 --> 43:58.303
- We're standing at the gateway to Hell.
- Please be quiet.

43:58.386 --> 44:02.016
Jennifer and I saw Nicholas get killed.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.226
We're all going to be killed
by that demon.

44:10.523 --> 44:13.572
Right now we're standing
right in front of the gate of Hell.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.403
Speak slowly.

44:18.156 --> 44:20.955
- Jigoku?
- Yes... It means Hell.

44:21.033 --> 44:24.958
And at this rate
everyone is going to die.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.664
I've seen the demon.

51:09.733 --> 51:13.488
Ruby, let's light a holy fire
to call upon our ancestors.

51:13.571 --> 51:16.666
- Okay.
- Maybe it can save you.

51:23.038 --> 51:25.917
It's not here...
Over there?

51:29.712 --> 51:31.009
Shit.

54:17.880 --> 54:22.886
The key to a healthy,
sparkling set of teeth.

58:45.981 --> 58:48.029
Jennifersan,
we have to burn it down.

59:02.622 --> 59:03.293
Rubysan.

59:05.042 --> 59:05.668
Rubysan!

59:14.259 --> 59:15.932
Rubysan!

59:22.517 --> 59:25.441
Rubysan!

59:40.118 --> 59:42.120
I'm sure she's all right.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:31.427
Yes, that's it.
Here!

01:00:32.337 --> 01:00:36.092
Let's burn down the windmill.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.428
Yes, fire!

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.319
There it is.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.121
Look at that.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.338
Wait a minute.

01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.422
With this.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.506
Happy Holland Tour Bus.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.311
Yes, exactly!

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.834
Painful situations like this
sometimes arise.

01:05:54.909 --> 01:05:59.255
If that happens,
it's my task to help the master.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.544
He takes care of the sinners
and I...

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.509
Right

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:18.651
One remorseful Asian down...
and an innocent little boy to go.
