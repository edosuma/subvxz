00:03.932 --> 00:05.398
Why we got to get a divorce?

00:05.708 --> 00:06.907
Because I have grown up

00:06.909 --> 00:09.109
and you are still
the same guy you were at 19.

00:09.111 --> 00:10.160
No, that is not true.

00:10.162 --> 00:11.512
I got a lot more money now.

00:11.514 --> 00:13.781
Not about what you have;
it's about who you are.

00:13.783 --> 00:15.115
Oh.

00:15.117 --> 00:17.985
Well, I'm pretty much

And I don't know how things
are going to play out,

02:45.490 --> 02:48.274

I'd like to bring her back here

02:48.276 --> 02:50.276

Is she homeless, too?

that she has a teenage son,

to forgive you for?

03:24.395 --> 03:27.179
Oh... I, uh...
I called her a slut

was sleeping with my brother,
