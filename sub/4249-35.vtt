11:49.250 --> 11:51.377
- I'LL DROP THE ARTICLE.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.211
- [gasps]

11:52.294 --> 11:54.255
[whispering]
YES. YES.

11:54.338 --> 11:56.340
- [muffled]

11:57.425 --> 12:01.971
- YOU REALLY NEED ME
TO DO THIS, SO...

12:02.054 --> 12:04.515
I'LL DO IT.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.725
- THANK YOU.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.773
- [sighs]

12:12.857 --> 12:14.692
SO...
- SO...

12:14.775 --> 12:17.319
- YOU DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.572
- NO.

12:19.655 --> 12:20.489
- YOU KNOW I KNEW THAT
BEFORE YOU CAME IN MY ROOM

12:20.573 --> 12:22.867
ALL HIGH HORSE AND STUFF.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.368
- AND WHAT ABOUT MARA?

12:24.452 --> 12:25.661
- WHAT ABOUT MARA.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.497
- ADMIT IT: YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME JEALOUS.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.750
- DON'T PUSH IT, YACKER.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.210
[sighs]
OKAY, MAYBE A LITTLE.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.170
WILL YOU CUT ME SOME SLACK NOW?

12:34.253 --> 12:36.005
- I GUESS.

12:36.672 --> 12:38.299
[footsteps approaching]

12:45.931 --> 12:49.059
- [sighs]
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.645
- OF COURSE.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.689
I'M JOY.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.609
- OKAY.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.861
- [inhales shakily]

12:58.944 --> 12:59.778
[exhales shakily]

13:06.869 --> 13:08.245
- I DID IT.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.455
- YOU DID?

13:09.538 --> 13:10.623
- YEAH.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.833
SHE'S NOT GOING TO PUBLISH
THE ARTICLE.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.211
- WOW!
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

13:15.294 --> 13:17.463
[giggles]

13:17.546 --> 13:19.089
- HMM.

13:23.552 --> 13:28.224
- EDDIE, ABOUT THIS ARTICLE...
- UH-HUH.

13:28.307 --> 13:33.479
- MARA ASIDE, I DON'T GET
WHY YOU'RE DOING IT.

13:33.562 --> 13:35.356
I THINK IT'S KIND OF LAME.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.149
- [scoffs]
I THINK IT'S REALLY COOL.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.985
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF GHOSTS
REALLY EXIST,

13:40.069 --> 13:41.237
BUT THE MORE YOU LOOK INTO IT,
THE LESS LAME IT GETS.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.447
TRUST ME.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.241
- WOW, YOU'RE REALLY SERIOUS
ABOUT IT.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.992
- SURE.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.537
BUT, I MEAN, YOU THINK
IT'S STUPID, SO...

13:49.620 --> 13:53.207
- NO.
ACTUALLY...

13:53.290 --> 13:55.417
I DON'T.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.920
BUT DON'T DO IT THE WAY
JOY WANTS IT.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.921
MARA'S RIGHT.

13:59.004 --> 14:02.132
YOU NEED IT TO BE TAKEN
SERIOUSLY...

14:02.216 --> 14:05.594
OR YOU WON'T BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.639
- YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:21.986 --> 14:22.903
- [exhales heavily]

14:34.081 --> 14:35.416
IS THIS A RAID?

14:37.668 --> 14:38.794
- SIT DOWN, BUDDY.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.921
WE'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT.

14:42.881 --> 14:42.965
- [scoffs]

14:49.221 --> 14:53.183
- TELL ME THIS ISN'T AS BAD
AS IT LOOKS.

14:55.894 --> 14:58.397
- IT'S ACTUALLY MUCH WORSE.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.948
- DO YOU WANT THE GOOD NEWS
OR THE BAD NEWS?

15:08.032 --> 15:09.116
- WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.784
- EDDIE AND I ARE GOOD AGAIN.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.037
- SHE COULDN'T DO IT.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.413
- I COULDN'T DO IT.

15:14.496 --> 15:17.875
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
FABIAN WAS AMAZING.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.543
I MEAN, YOU MUST HAVE BEEN.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.463
HE GOT JOY TO DROP THE ARTICLE.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.089
- THERE YOU ARE.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.508
JEROME'S GOT SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

15:26.592 --> 15:30.054
- TELL THEM.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.222
- HE TOOK THE DOLLHOUSE!
- WHAT?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.183
- SORRY, YOU TELL THEM.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.517
- I TOOK THE DOLLHOUSE.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.353
- BUT WH--
- WAIT. THERE'S MORE.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.647
- IT WAS FOR JASPER!

15:39.730 --> 15:40.481
SORRY.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.691
- I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT!

15:42.775 --> 15:43.859
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

15:43.942 --> 15:46.070
- 'CAUSE HE WAS BEING
BLACKMAILED.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.780
- AMBER!
- SORRY. SORRY.

15:47.863 --> 15:51.075
- JASPER IS NOT THE BAD GUY,
FABIAN.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.785
HE WAS BEING BLACKMAILED

15:52.868 --> 15:55.037
BY THE PERSON WHO KIDNAPPED
TRUDY.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.497
both: WHAT?

15:57.956 --> 15:58.832
- GET OUT.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.542
- VERA--VERA IS HIS AGENT.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.544
- WHOSE AGENT, JEROME?

16:02.628 --> 16:05.506
- RUFUS IS BACK.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.840
- RUFUS.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.717
NO!

16:08.801 --> 16:11.553
NO, HE'S DEAD.
WE READ HIS OBITUARY.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.390
- TRUST ME, HE'S ALIVE AND WELL.
- HOW?

16:14.473 --> 16:17.393
- ALL I KNOW IS IF HE DOESN'T
GET WHAT HE WANTS,

16:17.476 --> 16:20.270
THEN TRUDY IS D--

16:20.354 --> 16:23.565
TRUDY IS IN TROUBLE.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.068
- WHAT DOES HE WANT?
- SOMETHING IN THE HOUSE.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.152
HE'S BEEN SEARCHING
HIGH AND LOW

16:27.236 --> 16:30.239
FOR ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING
FROBISHER.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.908
THAT IS WHY HE WANTED
THE DOLLHOUSE.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.285
- NOT TO PLAY DOLLS.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.745
- HEY, I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
TELL YOU,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.707
BUT THERE WAS SO MUCH AT STAKE,
OKAY?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.709
TRUDY, YOU...
- ME?

16:41.792 --> 16:44.878
- YOU THREATENED JASPER, FABIAN.

16:44.962 --> 16:48.340
WE COULDN'T TELL YOU.
WE COULDN'T PUT YOU IN DANGER.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.009
- IT'S OKAY.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.265
- WHAT NOW?

16:56.348 --> 16:59.017
- WE HAVE TO TELL VICTOR.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.103
- RUFUS ZENO IS DEAD.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.272
- WELL, THEN HE FAKED IT,
BECAUSE HE'S NOT NOW.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.483
- VICTOR, I SAW HIM
WITH MY OWN EYES!

17:06.567 --> 17:09.778
AND VERA'S INVOLVED.
- NOW YOU HAVE GONE TOO FAR!

17:09.862 --> 17:12.281
- IT'S TRUE.
SHE WORKS FOR RUFUS.

17:12.364 --> 17:13.781
- ASK YOURSELF HOW SHE GOT
THE JOB.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.117
WERE THERE ANY OTHER APPLICANTS?

17:15.200 --> 17:16.452
- NO ONE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY--

17:16.535 --> 17:19.038
- VERA DEVENISH IS THE FINEST
HOUSEMOTHER

17:19.121 --> 17:20.455
THIS PLACE HAS EVER HAD.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.874
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!

17:21.957 --> 17:22.624
- MARA WAS RIGHT.
- SHE'S EVIL.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.960
- ENOUGH!

17:25.042 --> 17:27.253
- WHAT'S ALL THE COMMOTION?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.756
- [clears throat]

17:28.839 --> 17:32.259
- VICTOR?
- NOTHING.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.720
USUAL NONSENSE.
BE GONE, ALL OF YOU.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.263
- VICTOR--
- NOW!

17:43.020 --> 17:44.354
[clears throat]

17:49.777 --> 17:51.320
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:51.403 --> 17:54.323
- NOTHING.
[clears throat]

17:54.406 --> 17:59.953
WE'LL, UM, HAVE TO STAY CLOSE
TO THEM, THOUGH.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.413
[clears throat]

18:04.208 --> 18:05.334
- YOU'RE WHAT?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.711
- YOU HEARD ME.
I'M NOT RUNNING THE STORY.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.921
- WELL, WHY?

18:09.004 --> 18:11.089
- BECAUSE I'M THE EDITOR,
AND I SAY SO.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.008
- BUT IT'S A GREAT STORY.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.885
IT COULD BE HUGE FOR THE SITE.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.845
THINK OF THE "EYEBALLS."

18:16.929 --> 18:18.472
- I'M JUST GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
<i>THE JACKAL</i>

18:18.555 --> 18:20.015
A SUCCESS WITHOUT IT.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.184
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
AROUND HERE WHO CAN WRITE, MARA.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.103
- THIS WAS MY ONLY CHANCE
TO GET MY WORK OUT THERE.

18:25.187 --> 18:25.896
- I KNOW, AND I'M SORRY.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.398
BUT AFTER WHAT SWEETIE SAID,

18:28.482 --> 18:32.319
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PUT
YOUR NAME TO IT ANYWAY.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.322
- HUH.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.368
WELL, THAT MARKS THE END
OF MY "MAKING AN EFFORT" PHASE.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.162
- [sighs]

18:48.126 --> 18:50.629
- I BROUGHT YOU A CUP OF TEA
AND SOME FIG ROLLS.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.589
- OH, I'M NOT HUNGRY, VERA,
THANK YOU.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.884
- VICTOR, YOU HAVE TO KEEP UP
YOUR STRENGTH.

18:55.968 --> 18:56.552
HERE.
- OH.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.679
- [giggles]

19:00.097 --> 19:02.516
ANY PROGRESS?

19:02.599 --> 19:08.564
- UM, WELL, SOME OF THESE
PICTURES--

19:08.647 --> 19:12.734
THE SCARAB WITH THE ANKH
ON ITS BACK, THE CUPBEARERS--

19:12.818 --> 19:14.820
I THINK I'VE WORKED OUT
THAT TOGETHER

19:14.903 --> 19:17.698
THEY REFER TO A SILVER GOBLET

19:17.781 --> 19:21.034
WHICH ONCE BELONGED
TO SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.411
- DID YOU KNOW HER WELL?

19:22.494 --> 19:26.707
- HMM?
OH, YES. YES.

19:26.790 --> 19:28.458
ALL MY LIFE.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.294
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

19:30.377 --> 19:36.967
- OH, WELL, WE GREW APART,
AND...

19:37.050 --> 19:41.138
SOON AFTER I FOUND HER AGAIN,
SHE--SHE--SHE DIED.

19:41.221 --> 19:44.433
- OH.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

19:44.516 --> 19:48.061
- WELL, DEATH COMES TO ALL OF US
EVENTUALLY, VERA.

19:48.145 --> 19:52.608
WELL, MOST OF US, AT LEAST.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.902
- UH, SO THIS SILVER GOBLET--
WHERE IS IT NOW?

19:54.985 --> 19:59.114
- AH, NOW, THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

19:59.197 --> 20:02.868
IT STOOD IN THE DOWNSTAIRS
DRESSER FOR DECADES AND DECADES,

20:02.951 --> 20:05.370
BUT IT IS NO LONGER THERE.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.331
- WELL, THEY'VE BEATEN US TO IT.
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.124
- BUT VICTOR--
- OH, NOT TO WORRY.

20:09.207 --> 20:12.127
THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.588
WE HAVE THREE OF THE REFLECTORS,
YOU KNOW.

20:15.505 --> 20:18.467
- HE'S GOT THREE REFLECTORS?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.719
THAT MUST MEAN HE HAS
THE DOLL'S EYE AND TWO OTHERS.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.679
WHAT ARE THEY?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.389
- SEARCH ME, BUT HE'S ONTO US.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.017
HE'S FIGURED OUT
THE GOBLET'S MISSING,

20:27.100 --> 20:28.727
AND THEY KNOW IT WAS US.

20:28.810 --> 20:30.062
WE HEARD HIM TELLING VERA.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.189
- WAIT, HE TALKED TO VERA
ABOUT THIS?

20:32.272 --> 20:34.232
- YUP, AND TRUST ME,
THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

20:34.316 --> 20:36.318
OF ROMANTIC TENSION
BETWEEN THOSE TWO.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.904
- YEAH, BUT SHE'S WORKING
FOR RUFUS.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.405
- MAYBE SHE'S A DOUBLE AGENT.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.575
- YOU'VE GOT TO HAND IT TO HER.
SHE IS GOOD.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.952
- YEAH, SHE IS.

20:45.035 --> 20:49.873
THE LYING, DOUBLE-CROSSING
MASK-HIJACKING WITCH!

20:49.957 --> 20:51.500
HOODWINKING US
WITH HER CAKEY WAYS.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.543
- BACK IN THE ROOM, ALFIE.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.505
MAYBE VICTOR AND RUFUS
HAVE TEAMED UP.

20:56.588 --> 20:59.132
- WELL--
- THAT IS NOT A NICE THOUGHT.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.510
- EITHER WAY, VERA'S GOT VICTOR
WRAPPED AROUND HER FINGER.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.513
DID YOU SEE THE WAY SHE STUCK UP
FOR HIM THE OTHER DAY?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.807
- YUP.
A TOTAL PUPPY DOG.

21:06.890 --> 21:08.058
SO IN LOVE.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.644
- I--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.188
ALL I DO KNOW IS THAT WE CAN'T
TRUST EITHER OF THEM.

21:13.271 --> 21:15.983
- CAN WE RECAP
ON WHO I <i> CAN</i> TRUST,

21:16.066 --> 21:17.734
BECAUSE MY HEAD IS LITERALLY
ABOUT TO EXPLODE.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.946
- WHOEVER HE'S WORKING FOR,
GUYS, IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:21.029 --> 21:23.490
WE'VE GOT THE OTHER
THREE REFLECTORS, REMEMBER?

21:29.788 --> 21:30.831
[door opens]

21:41.842 --> 21:45.345
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.931
- [shakily] YEAH.

21:48.015 --> 21:51.810
IT WAS JUNK.
I THREW IT OUT.

21:51.893 --> 21:53.937
- THAT'S WHY YOU'RE THERE
AND I'M HERE.

21:54.021 --> 21:57.357
THIS THING IS PRICELESS.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.067
IT'S WORTH MORE THAN YOU,
IN FACT.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.028
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

22:01.111 --> 22:03.238
- IT MEANS SIMPLY
THAT VERY SOON,

22:03.321 --> 22:07.159
YOU WILL NO LONGER BE NEEDED.
