00:04.129 --> 00:06.173
IT WAS JUST A WEIRD COINCIDENCE

00:04.129 --> 00:06.173
THAT I WALK IN,

00:06.214 --> 00:07.925
AND CHRISTOPHER HAPPENS

00:06.214 --> 00:07.925
TO BE LEAVING A MESSAGE.

I'M NOT GONNA LIKE IT

00:07.967 --> 00:09.677
WHEN CHRISTOPHER CALLS,

EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.371
GOT TO GYPSY'S SHOP

01:59.078 --> 02:01.371

02:01.413 --> 02:03.498
THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER

02:01.413 --> 02:03.498

THAT'S HIS FAVORITE SPOT.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.165
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NEXT?

02:45.206 --> 02:47.084
TELL HIM HE CAN'T DRINK

02:45.206 --> 02:47.084

02:53.757 --> 02:55.634
WHAT?

NO.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.765
ADOPTED ANOTHER ONE?

05:47.430 --> 05:48.765
NO.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.142
WHAT?

05:50.184 --> 05:51.601
RECORDED THEIR MEOWS,

05:50.184 --> 05:51.601
DID SOME EDITING,

05:51.643 --> 05:53.645
AND CUT A RECORD OF THEM

05:51.643 --> 05:53.645
SINGING "RING OF FIRE."

05:53.687 --> 05:55.563
THAT GOES STRAIGHT

05:53.687 --> 05:55.563
TO THE TOP OF MY CHARTS.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.898
I STARTED READING

05:55.605 --> 05:56.898
"BEOWULF,"

05:56.940 --> 05:58.275
THAT NEW TRANSLATION

05:56.940 --> 05:58.275
YOU RECOMMENDED.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.734
THE SEAMUS HEANEY?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.734
GOOD FOR YOU.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.236
AND "STOPPED READING

05:59.776 --> 06:01.236
'BEOWULF'"

06:01.278 --> 06:03.280
JOTTED ON THE SAME SLIP

06:01.278 --> 06:03.280
THREE MINUTES LATER.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.823
YOU GAVE IT

06:03.322 --> 06:04.823
THE OLD COLLEGE TRY.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.950
OOH, THIS IS A NEW ONE.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.950
KIRK'S GOT A NEW HOBBY.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.368
HE'S DOING TAI CHI?

06:06.992 --> 06:09.368
HOW'D YOU KNOW THAT?

06:09.410 --> 06:11.038
BECAUSE HE'S DOING IT

06:09.410 --> 06:11.038
RIGHT THERE.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.498
IS IT POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO DO

06:11.079 --> 06:13.498
SOMETHING WITHOUT LOOKING SILLY?

06:13.540 --> 06:14.624
HE WOULDN'T BE KIRK THEN.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.710
BENDELSCHNITZ?

06:16.751 --> 06:18.419
THAT'S NOT ENGLISH.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.505
I KNOW. I'LL ADD IT

06:18.461 --> 06:20.505
TO THE ONES I CAN'T MAKE OUT.

06:20.547 --> 06:23.842
AND RAZZLEFRAT.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.843
ANOTHER UNREADABLE ONE.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.261
THEY'RE STACKING UP.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.972
OKAY.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.972
NOW WAIT OUT HERE.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.515
WHY?

06:30.557 --> 06:32.684
IT'S A THING, A MOMENT THING.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.684
JUST WAIT HERE.

06:34.853 --> 06:35.812
HEY.

06:37.438 --> 06:39.733
FOR THIS -- THE MOMENT

06:37.438 --> 06:39.733
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.360
[ ROLLS TONGUE ]

06:41.400 --> 06:42.819
WHAT'S THAT?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.819
IT'S A DRUM ROLL.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.363
SOUNDED MORE

06:42.861 --> 06:44.363
LIKE A HELICOPTER.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.405
NO, IT'S A DRUM ROLL.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.405
GO WITH IT, OKAY?

06:46.447 --> 06:48.283
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,

06:46.447 --> 06:48.283
RORY GILMORE!

06:55.707 --> 06:59.627
IT'S GREAT, YOU KNOW?

06:55.707 --> 06:59.627
YAY.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.129
I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER

06:59.669 --> 07:01.129
SAID "YAY" BEFORE.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.214
IT SOUNDED WEIRD.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.214
A LITTLE.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.422
COME. SIT, SIT.

07:03.464 --> 07:04.507
WHAT WAS THAT SOUND

07:03.464 --> 07:04.507
YOU WERE MAKING?

07:04.549 --> 07:05.884
A DRUM ROLL.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.219
IT SOUNDED LIKE A HELICOPTER

07:05.926 --> 07:07.219
OR SOMETHING.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.553
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.138
HAS NO ONE HEARD

07:08.595 --> 07:10.138
A DRUM ROLL BEFORE?

07:10.180 --> 07:12.140
HEY, I SAVED YOU THE BEST TABLE

07:10.180 --> 07:12.140
IN CASE YOU SHOWED.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.017
IN CASE?

07:12.182 --> 07:14.017
IT WAS MANDATORY.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.144
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

07:14.059 --> 07:16.144
NEVER MIND.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.022
I'M GONNA BRING YOU

07:16.186 --> 07:19.022
EVERYTHING YOU LIKE.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.022
SOUNDS GOOD.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.816
YOU WERE WITH ME WHEN

07:19.064 --> 07:21.816
I WROTE THIS. WHAT DOES IT SAY?

07:21.858 --> 07:25.320
OH, THIS IS FROM THAT STUPID

07:21.858 --> 07:25.320
MEXICAN RESTAURANT WE WENT TO.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.947
I WROTE SOMETHING

07:25.362 --> 07:26.947
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.198
MAN, THIS PLACE STUNK!

07:28.240 --> 07:30.033
I KNOW, BUT READ

07:28.240 --> 07:30.033
THE BACK THERE.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.036
LOOK WHAT WE PAID.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.036
UNBELIEVABLE.

07:30.075 --> 07:33.036
DOWNRIGHT USURIOUS.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.996
LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE

07:33.078 --> 07:34.996
THERE -- THE "RAZZLEFRAT."

07:35.038 --> 07:36.957
THEY DID CHARGE ME

07:35.038 --> 07:36.957
FOR THAT SECOND BEER.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.417
SCANDALOUS,

07:36.998 --> 07:38.417
BUT THE OTHER SIDE.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.335
6 BUCKS FOR GUACAMOLE.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.879
OH, JUST BRING ME

07:40.377 --> 07:42.879

SO, LUKE, WAIT. YOU HAVEN'T TOLD

07:42.921 --> 07:45.382
ME ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.383
WHAT'S NEW WITH YOU?

07:46.425 --> 07:49.052
WITH ME?

07:46.425 --> 07:49.052
UH, NOTHING.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.304
WE'RE ENGAGED,

07:49.094 --> 07:50.304
YOUR MOM AND ME.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.888
I KNOW THAT,

07:50.345 --> 07:51.888
BUT ANYTHING ELSE?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.641
NO. NO, WHY?

07:51.930 --> 07:54.641
JUST WONDERING.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.393
WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD?

07:54.682 --> 07:56.393
NOTHING.

07:54.682 --> 07:56.393
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING.

07:56.435 --> 07:58.853
WELL, THERE'S YOUR ANSWER --

07:56.435 --> 07:58.853
NOTHING'S NEW.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.481
I'M GONNA GO PUT IN

07:58.895 --> 08:01.481
YOUR ORDER, OKAY?

08:01.522 --> 08:03.191
WE'LL BE WAITING

08:01.522 --> 08:03.191
HUNGRILY.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.320
DID I INADVERTENTLY STEP

08:03.233 --> 08:06.320
INTO SOMETHING THERE?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.320
NO IDEA.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

08:06.361 --> 08:08.363
TOGETHER AGAIN,

08:08.405 --> 08:09.614
AND ALL IS RIGHT

08:08.405 --> 08:09.614
WITH THE WORLD.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.907
HI, LORELAI.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.907
HI, LANE.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT,

08:10.949 --> 08:12.492
I NEED YOU.

08:12.533 --> 08:13.910
TELL ME

08:12.533 --> 08:13.910
YOU'RE NOT BUSY.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.412
I'M NOT SURE.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.412
WHY?

08:15.454 --> 08:17.122
WE'RE DOING A SHOWCASE,

08:15.454 --> 08:17.122
ME AND THE BAND.

08:17.164 --> 08:20.459
NOT A GIG, A SHOWCASE,

08:17.164 --> 08:20.459
AND A LABEL'S GOING TO BE THERE.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
I'M SHAKING!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.002
I SHOULDN'T SHAKE.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.878
I'M A DRUMMER.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.878
IT'LL MESS UP THE BEAT.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.505
BUT, MY GOD,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.505
WE'RE PLAYING FOR A LABEL.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.049
WOW, LANE, I'M ABSOLUTELY THERE.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.049
THIS IS BIG.

08:28.091 --> 08:30.177
UNLESS IT'S

08:28.091 --> 08:30.177
A "WAITING FOR GUFFMAN" THING,

08:30.218 --> 08:32.304
AND THE LABEL GUYS

08:30.218 --> 08:32.304
DON'T SHOW UP.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.055
DID I JUST JINX IT?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.224
LET'S DO THAT UN-JINXING THING

08:34.097 --> 08:36.224
WE USED TO DO JUST IN CASE.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.434
GOOD.

08:37.476 --> 08:38.893
Both: JINX BACK,

08:37.476 --> 08:38.893
DOUBLE PINKY,

08:38.935 --> 08:41.271
AROUND THE SIDE,

08:38.935 --> 08:41.271
DOUBLE PINKY, JINX BACK.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.772
HEY,

08:41.313 --> 08:42.772
I WANT TO DO THAT.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.149
IT'S A SERIOUS THING.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.149
YOU DON'T JUST DO IT.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.608
SORRY.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.694
WELL, LANE, YOU GUYS

08:45.650 --> 08:47.694
ARE SO PREPARED FOR THIS.

08:47.735 --> 08:50.822
THAT TAPE YOU GAVE ME

08:47.735 --> 08:50.822
OF YOUR NEW STUFF WAS AWESOME.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.282
HEY, WHAT IF I JINX IT?

08:52.324 --> 08:53.825
DO I GET TO DO

08:52.324 --> 08:53.825
THE UN-JINXING THING THEN?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.827
IF WE JINX BACK A SECOND TIME

08:53.867 --> 08:55.827
WITHIN THE HOUR,

08:55.869 --> 08:57.745
IT CANCELS OUT

08:55.869 --> 08:57.745
THE FIRST JINX BACK.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.745
SORRY.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.498
WHAT WERE YOUR FAVORITES

08:57.787 --> 08:59.498
ON THE TAPE?

08:59.539 --> 09:03.084
"MELISSA" WAS CATCHY

08:59.539 --> 09:03.084
AND "CALLING FRANCINE,"

09:03.126 --> 09:06.129
BUT THAT OTHER ONE --

09:03.126 --> 09:06.129
"REBECCA IN THE MORNING"?

09:06.171 --> 09:08.173
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.173
MINE, TOO!

09:08.215 --> 09:10.217
ZACH'S INTO SONGS

09:08.215 --> 09:10.217
WITH GIRLS' NAMES, HUH?

09:10.258 --> 09:12.177
HE THINKS THAT'S OUR BEST SHOT

09:10.258 --> 09:12.177
AT RADIO PLAY.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.429
IT WORKED FOR THE POLICE,

09:12.219 --> 09:14.429
THE KNACK, FRANZ FERDINAND.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.723
GOOD THINKING.

09:14.471 --> 09:16.723
DO YOU WANT TO BE

09:14.471 --> 09:16.723
OUR D.A. PENNEBAKER?

09:16.764 --> 09:18.392
WE'RE BORROWING

09:16.764 --> 09:18.392
A VIDEO CAMERA,

09:18.433 --> 09:20.143
AND WE NEED SOMEONE SOBER

09:18.433 --> 09:20.143
TO DO THE PHOTOGRAPHY.

09:20.185 --> 09:22.103
I CAN SET MY CRACK PIPE ASIDE

09:20.185 --> 09:22.103
AND DO THAT.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.813
THANKS!

09:22.145 --> 09:23.813

OH, OKAY.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.152
HOW ABOUT YOU, LORELAI?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.154
WORKING THAT NIGHT, SWEETIE,

09:29.194 --> 09:31.154
BUT BREAK A LEG.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.114
DOES THAT GET ME

09:31.196 --> 09:33.114
A HAND THINGY?

09:31.196 --> 09:33.114

AS LONG

09:37.952 --> 09:39.704
AS YOU'RE PRYING...

09:37.952 --> 09:39.704
I WASN'T.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.997
BRIEFLY, SUCCINCTLY --

09:41.039 --> 09:42.916
LOGAN AND I

09:41.039 --> 09:42.916
ARE NOT TALKING RIGHT NOW.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.501
AH.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.087
WE HAD A FIGHT,

09:44.543 --> 09:47.087
A BIG ONE, IN PUBLIC.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.087
OOPS.

09:47.128 --> 09:50.465
I THINK WE NEEDED A LITTLE

09:47.128 --> 09:50.465
BREAK. IT'S MORE LIKE A HIATUS.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.093
WELL, SOMETIMES A BREAK

09:50.507 --> 09:53.093
IS GOOD.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.093
SOMETIMES.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.221
ALL RIGHT, FOOD,

09:53.134 --> 09:56.221
FIRST WAVE ONLY.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.722
