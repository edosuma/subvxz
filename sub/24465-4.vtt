07:07.680 --> 07:08.500
JOHNNY LAW.

07:08.600 --> 07:09.820
THEY CORNERED ME.

07:09.920 --> 07:11.860
I HAD TO BUG OUT ââ LAY LOW IN

07:11.960 --> 07:13.180
THE SHAG.

07:13.280 --> 07:14.700
( FOOTSTEPS APPROACH )

07:14.800 --> 07:16.860
( GUN COCKS )

07:16.960 --> 07:19.020
BUT THEY TOOK MY RIDE INTO

07:19.120 --> 07:19.940
IMPOUND.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.500
I COULDN'T ESCAPE.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.220
SO, I SURVIVED OFF THE CRUMBS

07:23.320 --> 07:24.860
DROPPED BY THE FUZZ OVER THE

07:24.960 --> 07:28.620
YEARS.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.940
IT WAS A BUM RAP, MAN.

07:31.040 --> 07:31.980
Rigby: HEAVY.

07:32.080 --> 07:33.780
SO, WHEN YOU FELLAS BROUGHT

07:33.880 --> 07:35.620
THESE BURRITOS INTO MY CAR, I

07:35.720 --> 07:36.900
COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.500
THEY SMELLED SO OUT OF SIGHT.

07:38.600 --> 07:38.940
DIG?

07:39.040 --> 07:40.700
OLD BARRY'S GONNA ENJOY SCARFIN'

07:40.800 --> 07:41.900
THESE LITTLE NUMBERS.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.460
Mordecai: EXCEPT WE BOUGHT

07:43.560 --> 07:44.700
THEM, SO THEY'RE OURS.

07:44.800 --> 07:45.740
NOW GIVE 'EM BACK!

07:45.840 --> 07:47.540
TAKE YOUR LAST WHIFF, 'CAUSE

07:47.640 --> 07:49.060
