00:02.364 --> 00:03.886
Here's the situation.

00:04.296 --> 00:06.088
Your parents went away on vacation.

00:06.584 --> 00:08.466
They left the keys
to the brand new Porsche.

00:08.879 --> 00:10.146
Would they mind?

00:10.577 --> 00:11.802
Of course not.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.370 --> 00:58.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:59.719 --> 01:01.268
Just a little something I know.

01:01.795 --> 01:05.043
- So what's up?
- Someone is on fire in Ramsett park.

01:05.168 --> 01:07.108
They need you to get
down there right away.

01:08.035 --> 01:09.085
Oh, my God.

01:29.939 --> 01:32.591
I've been spending the summer
doing a lot of zoo promotions.

01:34.393 --> 01:36.011
Parrots live a very long time,

01:36.179 --> 01:37.847
so we had a birthday party

01:38.015 --> 01:39.563
for a parrot that turned 60.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.167
Chimpanzees are very smart,

01:45.404 --> 01:47.356
so we had them graduate

01:47.524 --> 01:48.509
from college.

01:48.634 --> 01:51.360
And they like to fling their feces,
so we hoped they'd fling their hats,

01:51.669 --> 01:53.779
but they...
they just flung their feces.

01:55.584 --> 01:58.913
The Pawnee zoo recently purchased
two South African black-footed penguins,

01:59.038 --> 02:00.065
Tux and Flipper.

02:00.190 --> 02:02.136
And as part of our zoo promotion,

02:02.261 --> 02:04.540
we gonna give them
a marriage ceremony...

02:05.568 --> 02:07.279
because they mate for life.

02:07.816 --> 02:08.616
Tux...

02:08.957 --> 02:10.286
do you take Flipper

02:10.411 --> 02:12.330
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

02:15.303 --> 02:16.303
I do. I do.

02:17.023 --> 02:18.673
By the power vested in me

02:18.798 --> 02:21.043
from the department
of Parks and Recreation,

02:21.168 --> 02:23.406
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.363
Okay, well at least they're married.

02:37.756 --> 02:39.406
Are they making babies?

02:39.869 --> 02:42.620
No, not those two.
Those are both boy penguins.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.080
Sorry?

02:44.471 --> 02:46.277
Tux and Flipper are both boys.

02:46.402 --> 02:49.502
So you should have pronounced them
husband and husband, technically.

02:49.862 --> 02:51.112
That's awesome.

02:54.054 --> 02:56.550
Still... you couldn't have
asked for better weather.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.691
You big sandwich eater.

03:01.859 --> 03:03.109
Cut it out now.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.804
Just to be clear,
that was a friend punch.

03:05.929 --> 03:07.843
There was no flirtatious meaning

03:07.968 --> 03:09.939
behind that playful punch
I gave your arm.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.213
I do understand.

03:11.338 --> 03:12.746
You've made it abundantly clear

03:12.871 --> 03:15.486
that there's no romantic element
to our relationship in any way.

03:15.958 --> 03:16.772
Good.

03:17.080 --> 03:19.782
Isn't it good to be able
to horse around like this as friends?

03:19.950 --> 03:21.226
- It is...
- Yeah.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.202
I really hit rock bottom that night.

03:23.846 --> 03:25.746
And I mean that I literally fell

03:25.914 --> 03:28.127
to the bottom of a pit
and hit a rock.

03:28.378 --> 03:30.204
I remember laying there, thinking,

03:30.806 --> 03:33.286
"There's probably a good reason
why I'm down here...

03:33.675 --> 03:34.778
"and single. "

03:36.771 --> 03:39.135
And then I started thinking
that I need morphine.

03:39.419 --> 03:40.803
I hear you made

03:40.971 --> 03:43.264
two male penguins very happy today.

03:43.781 --> 03:46.016
You're making history.
I like that, sticking your neck out.

03:46.293 --> 03:48.394
I didn't stick my neck out.
It was an accident.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.104
Out of the mainstream, that's cool.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.791
- I'm in the mainstream.
- I know.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.856
- Not out of it.
- Social activism.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.571
People in this town don't really like
government employees being activists.

03:59.137 --> 04:00.947
Last year, a garbage man
was suspended

04:01.072 --> 04:03.159
for wearing a livestrong bracelet.

04:04.393 --> 04:06.996
Some guy who owns a gay bar
sent you a cake.

04:07.228 --> 04:08.726
Pawnee has a gay bar?

04:09.732 --> 04:10.583
The Bulge.

04:12.242 --> 04:13.803
It's behind my house.

04:13.928 --> 04:15.578
The Bulge is a gay bar?

04:16.291 --> 04:17.795
The nights I've wasted there.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.570
"Leslie, hey girrrrrrrrl. "

04:21.043 --> 04:22.245
With eight "r"s.

04:22.621 --> 04:24.782
"Thank you for supporting
the gay marriage.

04:24.907 --> 04:27.107
You rock!
The boys at the Bulge. "

04:27.476 --> 04:29.226
They thought
that was a political gesture?

04:29.782 --> 04:32.374
Nobody eat that cake.
Tom, step into my office.

04:32.499 --> 04:34.273
- That's also my office.
- Whatever.

04:34.398 --> 04:36.265
- I know that you are not gay.
- I'm not.

04:36.390 --> 04:38.012
- But you're effeminate.
- What?

04:38.137 --> 04:40.613
You're wearing a peach shirt
with a coiled snake on it.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.699
- Yes, 'cause it was featured
in Details magazine and it's awesome.

04:44.294 --> 04:46.519
Effeminate.
Anyway, so the point is...

04:46.644 --> 04:49.997
do you think that marrying penguins
made some kind of statement?

04:50.165 --> 04:52.831
Yes, the statement
was that you're very lonely,

04:52.956 --> 04:54.001
and you need a pet.

04:55.308 --> 04:56.997
They sent you t-shirts too.

04:57.345 --> 04:59.105
Look they sent us a t-shirt.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.178
Mine has a collar on it.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.491
There she is.

05:09.333 --> 05:12.280
This is my boyfriend, Derek,
and this is Derek's boyfriend, Ben.

05:15.153 --> 05:16.815
Wait, sorry.
What's the situation?

05:17.324 --> 05:19.393
- What do you mean?
- How does this work?

05:19.821 --> 05:21.623
Derek is gay.
But he's straight for me,

05:21.748 --> 05:23.700
but he's gay for Ben,
and Ben's gay for Derek.

05:23.825 --> 05:24.881
And I hate ben.

05:25.006 --> 05:26.408
It's not that complicated.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.369
Yeah. Sure.

05:28.537 --> 05:32.001
The thing about youth culture
is I don't understand it.

05:33.236 --> 05:36.169
- So what can I do for you guys?
- They just really wanted to meet you,

05:36.294 --> 05:38.545
because you're kinda
like their hero now.

05:40.832 --> 05:42.801
Please, it was just penguins.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.219
I'm a public servant,

05:44.344 --> 05:46.178
and I can't take a political stance.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.150
But you did, and it was awesome.

05:48.275 --> 05:50.396
None of the other politicians
ever take a stand,

05:50.521 --> 05:52.518
and it means a lot
to the gay community.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.658
It does. And we're gonna have this party
tomorrow night at the Bulge,

05:56.880 --> 05:58.602
and we had something to ask you.

05:58.727 --> 06:00.734
We really want you
to be the guest of honor.

06:01.058 --> 06:01.934
Oh, my!

06:02.445 --> 06:05.061
- It'd be amazing if you came.
- Yeah, you have to come.

06:05.186 --> 06:07.481
- Who made this?
- We did.

06:07.606 --> 06:08.867
- How?
- Photoshop.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.364
- What?
- Computers.

06:14.514 --> 06:15.874
Why are you all dolled up?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.604
It's a long story.

06:17.729 --> 06:19.982
I'm the guest of honor
at this gay bar.

06:20.163 --> 06:22.499
I guess gay men
are starting to like me.

06:22.999 --> 06:25.433
I don't know,
they think I'm fabulous or something.

06:25.977 --> 06:27.396
You look good, girl.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.138
You gonna turn somebody tonight.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.860
That was, hands down,
the best interaction

06:35.985 --> 06:37.438
I've ever had with Donna.

06:39.173 --> 06:41.259
This is Marcia Langman

06:41.610 --> 06:45.070
from the Society
for Family Stability Foundation.

06:45.752 --> 06:48.305
- Hello. I love your top.
- Thank you so much.

06:48.430 --> 06:51.785
I was hoping you had a moment to discuss
the events at the zoo yesterday.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.371
Well, I have nothing
to do with this, so...

06:54.982 --> 06:58.604
What can I do for you
and those fine people at...

06:59.108 --> 07:00.276
the SFSF?

07:00.629 --> 07:01.430
Well...

07:02.223 --> 07:04.631
you could resign.
If you're up for it.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.342
You're serious?

07:07.539 --> 07:10.662
When you performed
a marriage for gay penguins

07:11.018 --> 07:13.719
using taxpayer money
on government property,

07:13.844 --> 07:16.073
you were symbolically taking a stand

07:16.198 --> 07:18.548
in favor of the gay marriage agenda.

07:19.396 --> 07:21.303
I'm sorry,
but hold on a second there.

07:21.428 --> 07:24.247
Marcia, that was
not my intention at all.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.737
Why else would you marry penguins?

07:27.494 --> 07:29.988
Because I firmly believed
that it would be cute.

07:30.113 --> 07:31.113
And it was.

07:31.486 --> 07:32.534
Are you married?

07:33.898 --> 07:35.316
Not yet, Marcia.

07:35.916 --> 07:37.331
Soon.
Probably.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.034
I have a plan, but not...
no, not now.

07:40.159 --> 07:43.253
Not dating anyone yet.
Focusing on my career, but...

07:43.596 --> 07:44.777
I thought so.

07:44.902 --> 07:47.252
So you couldn't possibly understand.

07:47.377 --> 07:49.129
But when gays marry,

07:49.254 --> 07:51.845
it ruins marriage
for the rest of us.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.364
So either you annul the wedding

07:54.766 --> 07:56.975
or I'll publicly
ask for your resignation.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.348
You know what?

08:00.473 --> 08:02.754
I'm terrible with directions.
If I'm heading to the parking,

08:02.879 --> 08:05.109
- do I make a left, or I go right?
- Left.

08:05.832 --> 08:07.611
- You're welcome.
- Annul the wedding!

08:14.511 --> 08:16.332
I'm supposed
to meet Leslie for lunch,

08:16.457 --> 08:18.664
but she actually works, so...

08:20.532 --> 08:23.223
Mark was brought to my hospital
the night of the accident.

08:23.348 --> 08:24.753
He was here for a week.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.964
I think when his head hit the ground

08:27.146 --> 08:28.831
it must've knocked something loose,

08:28.956 --> 08:31.706
because he's actually
a pretty nice guy now.

08:32.951 --> 08:34.804
And Andy, after we broke up,

08:34.972 --> 08:37.414
he told me he was going to Kansas

08:37.623 --> 08:38.976
to climb mountains.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.589
So, I don't... I don't
really know where he is.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.358
Have you seen
that documentary about food yet?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.417
No, I haven't. But I heard
it's really good. I want to see it.

08:49.793 --> 08:51.128
We should go together.

08:52.481 --> 08:53.481
What?

08:54.050 --> 08:55.663
I don't...
I don't think so.

08:55.788 --> 08:57.953
That would be like a date.

08:59.470 --> 09:00.570
Say no more.

09:02.715 --> 09:03.865
I hate salad.

09:05.951 --> 09:07.880
I don't want to ever keep secrets
from you.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.993
Me neither.

09:09.118 --> 09:11.513
Let's invent our own secret language
that only we understand,

09:11.638 --> 09:14.679
and then we can use it around people
and no one will know what we'resaying.

09:16.755 --> 09:19.874
But in the meantime,
I'm just gonna tell you in English,

09:19.999 --> 09:21.977
Mark kind of asked me out.

09:23.256 --> 09:24.480
He weirdly asked me

09:24.648 --> 09:26.364
to go see a movie with him.

09:26.489 --> 09:27.941
And I said no, of course.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.136
But I just...

09:29.261 --> 09:31.069
I just wanted to let you know.

09:33.951 --> 09:36.033
I'm feeling a lot of confusing things
right now.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.351
No, of course you are.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.466
And your friendship
is the most important thing to me.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.929
And he's off-limits.

09:47.712 --> 09:48.712
Thank you.

09:49.839 --> 09:51.984
I was really serious
about that secret language.

09:52.109 --> 09:52.841
I know.

09:56.332 --> 09:57.939
I can't believe this is a gay bar.

09:58.064 --> 10:01.038
Especially with that heterosexual cowboy
greeting us on the way in.

10:01.163 --> 10:02.392
Where should I drink now?

10:02.560 --> 10:05.062
There's a bar called
Pitchers and Catchers. You can go there.

10:06.426 --> 10:07.606
Here's the plan.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.359
Our position is we have no position.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.210
So let's say
thank you for the party,

10:11.335 --> 10:14.738
but we regretfully decline
your offer to honor me.

10:15.058 --> 10:16.406
I can't believe you came.

10:17.978 --> 10:20.285
- It's Leslie Knope!
- Leslie Knope, you're my hero.

10:21.080 --> 10:21.828
Nice.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.960
- You are looking hot.
- Really?

10:24.984 --> 10:26.020
Thank you, Ben!

10:26.145 --> 10:28.345
I'm really enjoying this hug.

10:29.136 --> 10:31.046
It's so nice, but I need
to tell you something.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.408
- This one is on us.
- Well, if it's free.

10:43.118 --> 10:46.186
She's Leslie Knope
and she wants to recruit you.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.056
Oh, my. Okay, please...

10:52.844 --> 10:54.691
gentlemen, first of all...

10:55.035 --> 10:58.249
I would like to say thank you so much
for throwing me this party.

10:58.374 --> 11:00.492
Especially on a night
when the Colts are playing.

11:02.413 --> 11:03.913
We love you, Leslie!

11:07.843 --> 11:09.053
This is green.

11:19.304 --> 11:23.143
I wanted to tell you that I wasn't
really trying to take a stand

11:23.543 --> 11:25.879
when I married those...

11:26.418 --> 11:27.418
penguins.

11:29.419 --> 11:30.772
You're chanting my name.

11:34.394 --> 11:35.868
I just have one thing to say.

11:35.993 --> 11:38.320
Together we can
change Pawnee forever!

11:38.445 --> 11:39.545
Let's dance!

11:43.289 --> 11:46.330
Leslie Knope's in the building, y'all.
Let's get wild!

11:53.004 --> 11:55.287
- I've seen so many dudes
from city hall here tonight,

11:55.412 --> 11:56.462
it's crazy.

11:57.332 --> 11:59.126
But I guess
they've seen me here too.

11:59.251 --> 12:00.870
So, that's not great.

12:03.945 --> 12:05.640
I got your text, is everything okay?

12:06.216 --> 12:08.812
They're having a party in my honor.
Go to the bar.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.977
If you're my friend,
you can drink for free.

12:12.532 --> 12:15.734
And maybe next time, don't use the words
"medical emergency. "

12:16.280 --> 12:17.944
I'm so glad you're here!

12:18.112 --> 12:20.489
- I'm really sober.
- Okay, I'll get you a drink.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.696
You know why tonight's fun?

12:29.821 --> 12:31.571
'cause everyone's so gay.

12:32.207 --> 12:35.266
And they know how to have fun,
and the dancing!

12:36.305 --> 12:37.305
Just...

12:37.660 --> 12:39.955
it's everyone is just who they are,

12:40.080 --> 12:42.844
and who they are
is just stone-cold gay.

12:58.247 --> 12:59.695
I'm having such a nice time.

12:59.999 --> 13:01.958
I've met many interesting people.

13:02.083 --> 13:04.641
And there's two bisexual guys here,

13:04.766 --> 13:06.735
and I got both
of their phone numbers.

13:17.377 --> 13:18.407
All morning.

13:24.729 --> 13:25.887
Have fun last night?

13:26.055 --> 13:29.299
I had three drinks named after me,
so that's pretty fun.

13:29.424 --> 13:31.868
Plus, Ben and Derek
are taking me shopping on Saturday.

13:31.993 --> 13:34.104
And we're gonna find out
my actual bra size.

13:35.432 --> 13:37.566
I guess I'm kind of like
queen of the gays.

13:38.373 --> 13:39.532
Bully for you.

13:39.657 --> 13:42.571
<i>I just got a phone call.
They want you to go on Pawnee Today.</i>

13:42.903 --> 13:44.781
That's huge!
What's the topic?

13:45.896 --> 13:49.327
That Marcia from the family thing
is calling for your resignation.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.872
You gotta go on and defend yourself.

13:52.066 --> 13:55.125
Why? I haven't even officially
taken a stand on gay marriage.

13:56.122 --> 13:59.552
That's funny, somebody just told me
you were queen of the gays.

14:01.202 --> 14:02.340
That was me.

14:04.806 --> 14:06.842
<i>Pawnee Today, with Joan Callamezzo.</i>

14:06.967 --> 14:08.999
<i>It's kind of like
the Meet The Press of our town.</i>

14:09.124 --> 14:10.473
It's the big time.

14:10.598 --> 14:12.392
I know, it is.
I'm nervous.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.189
I just wish I was here
under different circumstances.

14:15.523 --> 14:16.523
Guess who!

14:17.134 --> 14:19.316
Megan Fox?
One of the Desperate Housewives?

14:20.234 --> 14:21.526
Joan Callamezzo.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.953
What's up?
Good to see you!

14:24.078 --> 14:26.072
Tom comes all the time.
Joan loves him.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.241
You have the softest skin
of any woman in Pawnee.

14:29.379 --> 14:30.633
I wish you could reach

14:30.758 --> 14:33.394
from your TV screen
and just touch Joan's skin for a second.

14:33.519 --> 14:36.041
That's sweet.
You're pretty soft yourself.

14:36.245 --> 14:38.376
- How are your kids doing?
- They're pretty good.

14:38.644 --> 14:41.213
Is it tough for them
to have a mother that is so beautiful?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.215
What's it like being
the most attractive?

14:43.421 --> 14:46.635
Keep up those funnies.
I'll have to invite you over for supper.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.428
I'll have to come over for supper.

14:48.772 --> 14:49.804
You well seem.

14:54.972 --> 14:55.934
My God!

14:56.396 --> 14:57.771
Ann Perkins.
How you doing?

14:58.400 --> 15:01.024
I'm good.
How was mountain climbing?

15:02.803 --> 15:03.693
What?

15:06.741 --> 15:09.241
Can I come in?
I wanted to talk to you for a second.

15:09.943 --> 15:10.824
Sure.

15:14.641 --> 15:17.290
<i>We have a controversial topic today.</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:20.008
<i>The gay penguin marriage
at the Pawnee Zoo.</i>

15:20.586 --> 15:23.463
So Marcia,
what is all the fuss about?

15:23.856 --> 15:26.156
The fuss is that Miss Knope

15:26.384 --> 15:29.761
claimed that she was not advocating
for this gay cause.

15:30.361 --> 15:31.867
And then that very night,

15:31.992 --> 15:35.262
she was the guest of honor
at a pro-gay marriage rally

15:35.387 --> 15:37.575
at a bar called The Bulge.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.312
How do you respond?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.232
I'd first like to say that I wasn't
trying to advocate for anyone.

15:42.604 --> 15:45.441
I did not know
that both of the penguins were males,

15:45.634 --> 15:48.834
and I was just trying
to perform a cute, fun ceremony

15:49.056 --> 15:50.490
to promote our local zoo.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.075
I have to say that

15:52.250 --> 15:54.557
that stunt that you did
with the penguins

15:54.682 --> 15:56.371
was clearly over the line.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.709
What if anything can Miss Knope do

15:59.834 --> 16:01.251
to make it right?

16:01.639 --> 16:04.877
- We don't want to be unreasonable.
- Of course not.

16:05.193 --> 16:08.091
We think
that she should separate the penguins,

16:08.259 --> 16:10.035
annul the marriage,

16:10.303 --> 16:11.469
reimburse the taxpayers

16:11.637 --> 16:13.805
for the cost of the wedding,
of course.

16:14.278 --> 16:15.849
And then resign.

16:16.089 --> 16:17.309
Is that it?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.206
- That would do it.
- Anything else?

16:19.331 --> 16:21.771
Want me to jump off a building?
Perform Harry Caray?

16:21.939 --> 16:23.982
Move to a different town.
No, I kid.

16:24.642 --> 16:25.844
Full of ideas today.

16:25.969 --> 16:28.503
This is the reason
why people don't go into politics.

16:28.628 --> 16:30.064
Because I bust my ass

16:30.189 --> 16:32.177
for the people in this city,
and I can't win.

16:32.450 --> 16:34.057
I have one night of fun

16:34.182 --> 16:36.913
with some of the best dancers
I've ever danced with,

16:37.038 --> 16:38.984
and suddenly
everybody's freaking out?

16:39.207 --> 16:41.170
Look at that!
We're lighting up here.

16:41.295 --> 16:43.501
Good, great, let's go for it.
Bring it on.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.848
How does this work?

16:44.973 --> 16:47.862
- There, you press that one...
- You're on the air.

16:48.530 --> 16:50.281
<i>I think that lady should resign.</i>

16:50.406 --> 16:52.365
Good, thank you.
Next caller.

16:52.869 --> 16:55.377
<i>You should resign
and repay your salary.</i>

16:55.502 --> 16:56.839
Two for resign.

16:56.964 --> 16:58.344
Thank you, next caller.

16:58.469 --> 17:01.478
<i>I just want to say that I love the zoo
and the zoo is really fun.</i>

17:03.326 --> 17:05.560
Thank you.
That's really sweet.

17:05.722 --> 17:07.442
<i>And I think you should resign.</i>

17:10.464 --> 17:12.364
You look great.
You look amazing.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.934
Thanks.
You look fancy.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.061
Yeah. The monkey suit.

17:17.186 --> 17:19.287
It cost 3,000 bucks,
but totally worth it.

17:19.617 --> 17:20.666
I sold out.

17:21.460 --> 17:24.969
I got a boring office job in town,
so I gotta dress up.

17:25.094 --> 17:26.510
You know, the grind.

17:26.635 --> 17:29.422
But I'm really happy,
and I really feel like I've matured...

17:30.287 --> 17:31.142
a lot.

17:31.768 --> 17:33.040
Good, that's...

17:33.165 --> 17:34.701
I'm happy for you.

17:35.096 --> 17:37.455
I was sitting
in the cubicle the other day,

17:37.580 --> 17:38.922
doing some thinking,

17:39.047 --> 17:40.183
some growing...

17:40.351 --> 17:43.144
- And some maturing.
- Yes, maturing.

17:45.371 --> 17:47.315
Darn it if I don't just miss you.

17:48.805 --> 17:50.955
And... "a"- cakes, just let me...

17:51.993 --> 17:53.467
I love you, and...

17:54.499 --> 17:57.784
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.
I was the worst boyfriend ever.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.869
I know that.
And I...

18:00.311 --> 18:02.706
I think it would behoove us
to give it another shot.

18:03.903 --> 18:05.053
Yeah, look...

18:05.417 --> 18:07.560
I'm really happy
for you about your job

18:07.685 --> 18:10.059
and that you've learned
some new words,

18:10.184 --> 18:12.590
but I'm sure about my decision.

18:15.717 --> 18:17.364
OK. Say no more.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.888
Listen, hit me up on my cell phone.

18:20.013 --> 18:21.516
I'll be around.

18:21.999 --> 18:24.352
And if you wanna talk
or grab coffee,

18:24.520 --> 18:26.354
- or something like that, OK?
- OK.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.356
Gotta get back to the office.

18:28.797 --> 18:30.901
- Have a good one. Good seeing you.
- Bye.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.638
The hardest part
about living in this pit?

18:48.045 --> 18:50.495
It's probably keeping
my suit pressed.

18:54.420 --> 18:55.570
And the rats.

18:56.427 --> 18:59.095
It's like a freakin' rat parade
every night.

18:59.487 --> 19:02.948
I just want to be close to her house
because I need to protect her.

19:03.073 --> 19:06.436
'cause there are some weird people
that live around here.

19:06.604 --> 19:09.484
<i>If you let penguins get married,
where does it end?</i>

19:09.609 --> 19:12.177
<i>I mean, would you let me
marry my guinea pig?</i>

19:12.302 --> 19:16.071
<i>Because I want to marry my guinea pig.
I'll take my answer off the air.</i>

19:16.239 --> 19:19.708
- That's a valuable point.
- Attendance is up 30% at the zoo.

19:19.833 --> 19:21.042
You're welcome!

19:21.167 --> 19:24.454
And that penguin wedding was cute.
And I'm not gonna annul it.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.997
I'd ask you to reconsider.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.792
Well, I'd ask you to stop asking me.

19:29.038 --> 19:31.419
Because It's not gonna happen,
Marcia

19:31.587 --> 19:33.932
- Is that right?
- Last time I checked, I don't think...

19:34.057 --> 19:35.507
I murdered anyone,

19:35.675 --> 19:38.303
or had an affair, or did drugs!

19:38.551 --> 19:40.119
But I apologize.

19:40.244 --> 19:43.473
I apologize for having fun
and for making something cute.

19:46.142 --> 19:49.542
- Where are you from originally?
- What did I do?

19:51.384 --> 19:54.943
- So you will not be annulling...
- No, I will not be annulling.

19:59.953 --> 20:01.103
Look at them.

20:01.825 --> 20:03.887
They're just in their own little...

20:04.012 --> 20:05.512
penguin love bubble.

20:07.005 --> 20:08.191
That's what it's like

20:08.316 --> 20:11.089
when you meet your mate
and know you're gonna be together.

20:17.015 --> 20:19.519
You know what I realized?
We're just animals.

20:19.644 --> 20:21.654
We don't know anything about love.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.739
You should go with Mark.

20:25.705 --> 20:27.331
Really, I thought about it.

20:27.456 --> 20:30.854
Look, he might not be my gay penguin,
but he could be yours.

20:31.216 --> 20:34.149
Look, I told you, I'm not
going on a date with him.

20:34.317 --> 20:37.821
If you don't wanna go out with him,
don't. But don't do it because of me.

20:37.946 --> 20:39.112
I'm fine with it.

20:40.171 --> 20:42.198
All that's important
is we're friends.

20:42.516 --> 20:44.264
- Me too.
- Good, great.

20:47.776 --> 20:51.171
Plus, I already called and told him
that you were dying to go out, have fun.

20:53.755 --> 20:56.488
So I transferred
the penguins to a zoo in Iowa.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.483
Gay marriage is legal there,
so hopefully they'll be happy.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.457
At least they'll be together.

21:06.420 --> 21:09.359
Look! Six Flags!
I should take them on a water slide.

21:09.798 --> 21:12.348
They might die.
But it would be so cute!
