01:34.259 --> 01:35.861
Burial ground.

01:35.894 --> 01:36.762
Apache.

01:44.368 --> 01:45.271
What are you doin'?

01:47.305 --> 01:50.843
Redskins, Apache and
otherwise tend to entomb

01:50.876 --> 01:54.780
their department with some
finery, jewelry and the like.

01:56.147 --> 01:57.950
I think you should
leave it alone.

02:00.052 --> 02:01.854
Superstitious, are ya?

02:07.224 --> 02:08.258
I'm headin' off.

02:08.293 --> 02:09.395
You wanna stay,
that's fine by me.

02:31.983 --> 02:32.852
Hugo.

02:34.118 --> 02:36.288
That's my name.

02:36.320 --> 02:40.192
I know but, what
kinda name is that?

02:40.224 --> 02:41.326
Where you from, anyway?

02:43.194 --> 02:45.897
Two weeks on the trail
you finally think to ask me.

02:47.199 --> 02:48.100
Forget it then.

02:50.102 --> 02:51.236
Hunger pains.

02:53.805 --> 02:55.408
Skinny as you are must be hard.

02:59.343 --> 03:02.381
Here, last of the jerky.

03:06.050 --> 03:09.721
Don't fret, be dawn
in a few hours.

03:11.323 --> 03:15.861
Should run across
something more substantial.

03:17.361 --> 03:19.965
This is what we get for
coming back empty-handed.

03:21.332 --> 03:23.234
I wouldn't say empty-handed.

03:28.139 --> 03:30.208
Put that up.

03:30.241 --> 03:31.375
What'd you say?

03:31.408 --> 03:33.111
I said put it up.

03:33.145 --> 03:34.313
Why?

03:34.346 --> 03:35.948
I don't think you
should've took it.

03:37.816 --> 03:41.086
White Mountain Apache, maybe.

03:41.118 --> 03:41.986
Navajo.

03:43.388 --> 03:44.355
Not so sure.

03:47.092 --> 03:48.993
Don't matter nohow.

03:49.026 --> 03:51.095
All that counts is I know
it fella out in Tunstall

03:51.128 --> 03:53.733
who pays tiptop for
all this Injun stuff.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.137
It's wrong misusin'
your dead like that.

03:59.403 --> 04:00.239
Why?

04:01.973 --> 04:03.475
Dead ain't got no
use for things.

04:26.497 --> 04:28.199
Hugo?

04:28.233 --> 04:29.134
Somethin' bit me.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.502
Rattler, I think.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.005
Yep, got you good.

04:40.245 --> 04:41.112
Ow!

04:46.250 --> 04:47.819
That's disgusting.

04:47.853 --> 04:50.122
Sorry you
find this unpleasant.

04:51.288 --> 04:53.257
Make sure you suck
out all the poison.

04:53.290 --> 04:55.060
Ain't my first
snake bite, Benny.

04:57.928 --> 04:59.397
Give me that hooch.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.998
Does that hurt?

05:02.033 --> 05:03.968
It hurts like
moth piss, goddammit.

05:06.103 --> 05:06.971
Easy!

05:11.343 --> 05:12.511
That's our only bottle.

05:14.144 --> 05:15.914
Your concern is quite
touching, Benny.

05:17.214 --> 05:18.082
Yeah.

05:24.189 --> 05:25.224
Ahg!

05:25.257 --> 05:27.425
Oh, god.

05:30.362 --> 05:31.230
Ow.

05:32.163 --> 05:34.032
Get some air on it.

05:34.064 --> 05:35.100
Yeah, thanks Mom.

05:37.369 --> 05:39.004
Should be right come mornin'.

05:42.206 --> 05:43.509
Go to sleep, Benny.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.620
Venom runnin' it's course?

05:56.521 --> 05:57.389
Christ, Hugo!

05:59.925 --> 06:00.559
Help me.

06:10.367 --> 06:11.536
Hey, partner, hey.

06:25.382 --> 06:28.019
What the hell is goin' on here?

08:13.524 --> 08:14.392
Elmer.

08:17.127 --> 08:18.163
Hey.

08:18.196 --> 08:19.264
Hell, woman.

08:19.297 --> 08:21.133
That's Mrs. Jackson to you.

08:22.533 --> 08:23.401
Okay.

08:25.702 --> 08:28.239
Reminding me of the
overly familiar?

08:28.273 --> 08:29.141
Get up.

08:32.076 --> 08:32.745
Shit.

08:39.616 --> 08:41.251
Elbows.

08:41.284 --> 08:42.453
What?

08:42.486 --> 08:43.453
On the table.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.324
That they are.

08:46.356 --> 08:48.360
You want some breakfast,
you'll be movin' 'em.

08:53.398 --> 08:56.134
Fitting to make a proper
gentlemen out of me still?

08:57.368 --> 08:59.403
Too late for that, I'm afraid.

08:59.437 --> 09:01.406
But a meager amount of
proper manners from you

09:01.438 --> 09:03.474
makes your company
more acceptable.

09:06.211 --> 09:07.145
Could be Dalton.

09:09.714 --> 09:10.783
Get out of sight.

09:19.423 --> 09:20.292
Elmer.

09:21.192 --> 09:21.826
Till!

09:34.739 --> 09:37.341
Top of the mornin'
to ya, Ms. Jackson.

10:58.655 --> 11:00.458
All that my own
two arms can carry.

11:01.826 --> 11:04.428
Come now, that's
hardly half a bushel.

11:21.346 --> 11:22.214
Nelly.

11:28.485 --> 11:29.554
Lord above us.

11:33.890 --> 11:34.759
Go!

11:56.547 --> 11:57.615
Hello!

12:02.720 --> 12:04.923
What do you make
of this, Marshall?

12:04.956 --> 12:06.358
Place is deserted.

12:07.725 --> 12:08.894
Who goes there?

12:11.461 --> 12:12.764
Better watch where you're
pointin' that gun, boy.

12:12.797 --> 12:14.332
I ain't your boy, mister.

12:15.566 --> 12:17.269
I would venture not.

12:17.302 --> 12:20.038
Still, as one law
man to another,

12:20.071 --> 12:22.540
I'd ask you to take
that gun off my deputy

12:22.572 --> 12:24.375
as they have a way of goin' off.

12:31.649 --> 12:32.850
He puts his away first.

12:48.700 --> 12:49.901
Much obliged to ya.

13:00.644 --> 13:01.513
Ow.

13:07.818 --> 13:09.853
I sure wish you
wouldn't shoot me.

13:09.886 --> 13:13.291
But at this point, it
might be a mercy killin'.

13:20.965 --> 13:22.533
Damn it all.

13:22.567 --> 13:23.668
What's happened here?

13:24.936 --> 13:25.804
Plague.

13:27.038 --> 13:27.871
Plague?

13:27.904 --> 13:29.473
Yes, plague.

13:29.506 --> 13:30.941
Cholera.

13:30.975 --> 13:34.045
It took half the town,
the ones that didn't run.

13:34.077 --> 13:35.780
Name's Marshall Bascom.

13:37.081 --> 13:38.615
Okay.

13:38.649 --> 13:42.419
I have in my custody
a one Margaret Jackson,

13:42.452 --> 13:45.889
fugative wife of the
outlawed Dalton Jackson.

13:45.923 --> 13:48.426
The one with the bullet
in him's Elmer Till.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.494
I need to speak with
Sheriff Farnsworth

13:50.528 --> 13:52.697
'cause there's a reward
out for both of 'em.

13:55.700 --> 13:58.370
The sheriff died last week.

14:02.740 --> 14:03.875
His deputy, then.

14:04.841 --> 14:06.912
The deputy died two weeks ago.

14:08.178 --> 14:11.815
The young man, James,
has taken upon himself

14:11.849 --> 14:13.852
to keep me safe.

14:17.889 --> 14:18.823
What now?

14:20.557 --> 14:22.360
We'll make for
Prescott Junction.

14:23.628 --> 14:26.564
That's them
mountains, that's hard ridin'.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.432
Of course you could
just cut loose to me,

14:28.466 --> 14:29.768
save yourselves the trouble.

14:33.703 --> 14:34.872
I'll lighten the load.

14:36.206 --> 14:38.610
That one ain't worth half
a bucket of horse piss.

15:04.235 --> 15:06.071
Wondering
when you'd wake up.

15:10.674 --> 15:11.876
How long was I out for?

15:12.809 --> 15:13.878
Few hours at least.

15:15.679 --> 15:17.548
That's a nasty
gash you got there.

15:19.216 --> 15:20.851
How'd you tie me up?

15:20.884 --> 15:22.086
I'll ask the questions.

15:24.922 --> 15:25.556
Ask then.

15:26.857 --> 15:29.092
You got blood on your shirt.

15:29.125 --> 15:30.194
Beast or man's?

15:31.863 --> 15:33.098
A bit of both, I guess.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.836
What can you
tell me about this?

15:40.671 --> 15:42.507
Rummage through
my pockets, did ya?

15:42.539 --> 15:44.208
Passed out on my property.

15:44.241 --> 15:46.777
Kind of figures that gives me
a right to do is as I see fit

15:46.811 --> 15:48.713
with a man and
anything on his person.

15:52.149 --> 15:54.186
You wanna rob me, fine.

15:55.253 --> 15:59.124
It's all yours in
exchange for some water.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.927
You know what this is?

16:05.028 --> 16:06.730
A necklace.

16:06.764 --> 16:07.999
What kinda necklace?

16:09.767 --> 16:10.635
Indian.

16:13.236 --> 16:15.139
An elder death token.

16:15.172 --> 16:16.841
Sacred.

16:16.874 --> 16:19.009
Worn by only the high
and finest among them.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.644
That so?

16:20.677 --> 16:23.215
The only thing is, it's
never worn by the livin'.

16:24.315 --> 16:26.951
Chiefs and medicine men
are buried with 'em.

16:26.984 --> 16:28.620
Truly fascinating.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.556
You're a grave robber.

16:31.589 --> 16:32.891
You're a kidnapper.

16:32.923 --> 16:33.792
Tell me.

16:36.226 --> 16:37.095
Fine.

16:38.229 --> 16:41.066
So I picked up off
a dried up redskin.

16:43.701 --> 16:45.069
That a hangin' offense now?

16:45.101 --> 16:47.872
Doesn't cause a pinch of
insult to me personally.

16:49.005 --> 16:50.608
But the Indians
on the other hand.

16:51.808 --> 16:53.644
I guess they'd
be none too happy.

16:54.845 --> 16:56.980
And that there's
what makes for concern.

16:57.014 --> 16:59.182
See, I've lives peaceably
among these folks,

16:59.216 --> 17:00.851
passin' near 14 years.

17:01.985 --> 17:04.288
Trade with 'em, one or two

17:05.589 --> 17:07.558
I'd go so far as to
call friends of a sort.

17:08.925 --> 17:10.294
At least what passes for
friends on this mountain.

17:16.098 --> 17:17.201
Happy for ya.

17:19.836 --> 17:22.906
So, hopin' in all that time

17:22.940 --> 17:24.942
I've managed to square
away enough goodwill

17:24.976 --> 17:26.778
that if I return
this here trinket,

17:28.112 --> 17:32.083
and the one that took it, all
go on friendly like before.

17:33.217 --> 17:34.652
What?

17:34.684 --> 17:35.919
No, you can't be serious.

17:35.952 --> 17:36.820
Claire!

17:38.388 --> 17:39.957
I'm leaving our
guests in your charge

17:39.990 --> 17:42.660
while I go callin'
on Chief Red Feather.

17:42.692 --> 17:43.827
Now just hold up a minute.

17:43.861 --> 17:45.296
Prefer to hand him
over less spoiled,

17:45.328 --> 17:47.331
but if he gives
you any problems,

17:47.365 --> 17:49.067
I wouldn't have you hesitate.

17:49.099 --> 17:49.967
Understand?

17:51.669 --> 17:52.804
I do.

17:52.836 --> 17:53.704
Good girl.

17:56.773 --> 17:57.641
Hold up!

17:58.643 --> 17:59.310
Mister!

18:33.911 --> 18:34.778
Masie!

18:42.153 --> 18:43.020
Masie!

19:08.479 --> 19:10.048
You got a name?

19:10.980 --> 19:12.450
Yes, ma'am.

19:12.482 --> 19:13.817
Can you tell me?

19:14.751 --> 19:15.419
Riggs.

19:16.721 --> 19:18.189
Riggs.

19:18.221 --> 19:20.224
Your mama must not've
liked you much.

19:21.892 --> 19:24.228
Well, Nathaniel.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.431
Friends call me Nat though.

19:26.463 --> 19:29.966
Well that doesn't fit 'cause
I can hardly call you friend.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.369
I guess we'll have
to live with Riggs.

19:32.403 --> 19:33.872
That or Deputy Marshall.

19:35.005 --> 19:36.441
I like Riggs better.

19:36.473 --> 19:37.708
Fine by me.

19:38.942 --> 19:41.778
Your friend there,
is he always that way?

19:41.811 --> 19:42.946
What way's that?

19:47.084 --> 19:48.986
Hey, boss man.

19:49.019 --> 19:50.087
You know my husband and his men

19:50.121 --> 19:51.322
are gonna come looking for me.

19:51.355 --> 19:52.691
I expect they will.

19:54.057 --> 19:56.760
But that's no
cause for concern?

19:56.794 --> 19:58.697
Kinda getting
ahead of Angel Vet.

19:59.963 --> 20:02.733
That was my reason for
takin' ya in the first place.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.736
Take a man's wife.

20:04.769 --> 20:06.837
Sound enough way to
draw them into a trap.

20:08.806 --> 20:09.973
That was my reckonin'.

20:11.541 --> 20:14.177
Only you hadn't heard
about the plague in Redstone.

20:14.211 --> 20:16.314
Hadn't figured on havin'
to fend off his gang

20:16.346 --> 20:19.083
with the help of
only a single deputy.

20:19.115 --> 20:20.919
You got a good
read on things, miss?

20:22.153 --> 20:24.823
I'm not overly fond of
fraternizin' with my prisoners.

20:27.290 --> 20:28.859
I'm gonna need you to stop.

20:30.126 --> 20:31.294
Huh, that so?

20:31.327 --> 20:32.196
Yeah.

20:33.130 --> 20:33.965
Why?

20:33.998 --> 20:34.865
Call of nature.

20:36.467 --> 20:37.435
You can't hold it?

20:39.103 --> 20:40.238
Wouldn't of had all that tea

20:40.270 --> 20:41.873
had I known I was
about to be abducted.

20:42.972 --> 20:44.341
Shit.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.542
Piss, actually.

20:45.576 --> 20:46.844
Marshall.

20:46.876 --> 20:47.511
I heard it.

20:48.913 --> 20:52.784
Myself,
so it's up ahead there.

21:03.160 --> 21:04.362
Wo, wo, wo, wo.

21:05.829 --> 21:06.497
You go with her.

21:07.932 --> 21:09.467
She tries to run.

21:13.971 --> 21:14.838
Yes, sir.

21:16.472 --> 21:18.276
And don't let her
outta your sight.

21:30.186 --> 21:31.188
Will this suffice?

21:35.192 --> 21:36.059
All right, then.

21:39.230 --> 21:40.163
Would you?

21:40.196 --> 21:41.064
Ma'am?

21:42.132 --> 21:43.835
I can't go if you're watching.

21:46.303 --> 21:47.438
You got 30 seconds.

21:47.471 --> 21:48.905
I'm timin' you.

21:48.939 --> 21:50.074
You're a true gentleman, sir.

21:50.106 --> 21:51.209
Yeah, yeah.

21:56.946 --> 21:59.583
I ain't hearing
any water, ma'am.

22:00.651 --> 22:02.452
Ah, geez, ah!

22:05.189 --> 22:06.057
Geez!

22:06.089 --> 22:06.957
Fuckin' leg.

22:06.990 --> 22:08.125
I knew it.

22:12.962 --> 22:13.831
Stop goddammit.

22:14.632 --> 22:16.000
Don't make me shoot you.

22:23.507 --> 22:24.375
Ugh!

22:34.384 --> 22:35.586
Get your filthy hooks off of me.

22:35.618 --> 22:37.988
Gotta set a long on you

22:38.021 --> 22:40.323
and a wonderful,
colorful vocabulary.

22:40.356 --> 22:41.358
Fuck you to hell.

22:43.661 --> 22:46.096
Quite the visage
of feminine virtue.

22:50.667 --> 22:52.936
Turned your back
on her, didn't ya?

22:54.203 --> 22:55.038
Sorry, boss.

22:56.205 --> 22:58.041
Point, the fault
was in thinking you

22:58.075 --> 23:00.144
were conversin' with a lady

23:00.176 --> 23:04.347
instead of a sullied,
little harlot.

23:04.381 --> 23:07.384
Let that busted leg be
the lesson of the day.

23:07.417 --> 23:10.020
She could feign a
grace and composure

23:10.054 --> 23:13.557
of the prim and proper,
but she's the serpent.

23:15.392 --> 23:17.295
And that was but a
drop of her venom.

23:19.229 --> 23:20.431
Live and learn, son.

23:29.506 --> 23:34.345
Now, as for you, you get to
walk the rest of the way.

23:34.377 --> 23:36.547
Not really a lesson
as I'm well advised

23:36.579 --> 23:38.348
that you're far
from reformation.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.253
Punishment has its place too.

23:56.066 --> 23:57.168
Dalton, you okay?

23:58.268 --> 24:00.038
You got some smarts
about ya, Vern,

24:01.538 --> 24:03.473
but yet there's one
stupid fuckin' question.

24:07.044 --> 24:07.711
Hitch is back.

24:14.018 --> 24:14.952
What'd you learn?

24:16.386 --> 24:19.155
Well, some good and
some bad, I'm afraid.

24:19.189 --> 24:20.557
Spill it.

24:20.590 --> 24:21.992
Well, Masie's alive.

24:23.493 --> 24:26.630
Ah, thank God.

24:29.432 --> 24:30.367
And the bad?

24:31.769 --> 24:35.573
They.

24:35.605 --> 24:36.673
Shit.

24:36.707 --> 24:37.775
Hardest nut in the territory,

24:37.807 --> 24:40.044
I didn't know he was tailing us.

24:40.076 --> 24:41.211
Where?

24:41.244 --> 24:42.980
Couldn't turn her
over in Redstone.

24:44.781 --> 24:45.949
Man I spoke with
said he's fixin'

24:45.982 --> 24:49.252
to cross over the mountain,
pass her off in Prescott Valley.

24:50.686 --> 24:52.222
He tell you when they set out?

24:52.256 --> 24:53.591
They dispatched
Elmer this morning

24:53.624 --> 24:55.226
and then headed for the hills.

24:57.294 --> 24:58.162
Goddamn.

25:03.166 --> 25:04.034
All right.

25:05.803 --> 25:07.371
They gotta have a day's
head start at least.

25:07.403 --> 25:09.240
We ride hard, we might be
able to cover enough ground.

25:09.272 --> 25:11.375
Yeah, to ride into
a well-laid ambush.

25:11.407 --> 25:13.109
Man said he only had
one deputy with him,

25:13.143 --> 25:15.278
so I doubt he's
planning a big ambush.

25:18.147 --> 25:20.217
You know there's
another way about this.

25:21.417 --> 25:22.552
What's that?

25:22.586 --> 25:25.789
Only one road fit for
horses through that mountain,

25:25.823 --> 25:27.358
so we know where they'll be.

25:27.391 --> 25:29.125
I used to trap in that
country and it seems like

25:29.159 --> 25:30.294
there's another way.

25:31.761 --> 25:34.130
We're gonna have to
leave the horses here.

25:34.163 --> 25:38.568
On foot, one miserable
bastard of a climb, but-

25:38.602 --> 25:39.769
- If you cut 'em off.

25:39.803 --> 25:42.673
Make up for lost
time and then some.

25:42.705 --> 25:46.109
And hell, maybe even give
'em a surprise of our own.

25:46.143 --> 25:47.045
Damn right.

25:48.011 --> 25:49.613
All right, we're not
wastin' another minute.

25:49.645 --> 25:50.647
Leave the way, Vern.

26:05.362 --> 26:06.230
Mister?

26:07.730 --> 26:09.799
What's gotten ahold of you?

26:12.903 --> 26:13.770
It's a fever?

26:16.839 --> 26:17.707
Hey.

27:00.683 --> 27:02.385
Why are you away
from your perch?

27:02.419 --> 27:04.488
There's something terrible
and wrong with that man.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.523
All the more reason
to keep your gun on him.

27:06.557 --> 27:07.490
Go.

27:07.523 --> 27:09.325
I think he's dying, Judith.

27:09.358 --> 27:10.528
I don't know what to do.

27:11.795 --> 27:14.599
All right, let's
have a looksy.

27:23.207 --> 27:23.875
Give that here.

27:40.624 --> 27:41.491
Hey fella.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.493
Is he dead?

27:46.462 --> 27:47.330
Wake up now.

28:00.309 --> 28:02.445
Got off easy, all considerin'.

28:03.713 --> 28:06.482
Shutter to think what the
Indians would've done with him.

28:06.516 --> 28:07.852
What happened to his face?

28:08.751 --> 28:10.486
Should we bury him?

28:10.519 --> 28:11.388
No.

28:12.788 --> 28:13.657
Leave him.

28:28.638 --> 28:29.873
Somethin' spook ya, boy?

28:31.040 --> 28:34.711
Hey, hey, c'mon,
calm down, calm down.

28:38.582 --> 28:39.884
Agh, goddamn, ah.

28:44.488 --> 28:45.855
Don't, don't.

28:45.888 --> 28:49.960
Please just, you were
lookin' for this, right?

28:52.395 --> 28:53.630
I was fixin' to
bring that to ya.

28:55.565 --> 28:56.433
Please, please.

29:01.672 --> 29:04.775
You've been awful quiet
this past mile or so.

29:05.909 --> 29:07.778
Blow it out your
backside, Marshall.

29:09.846 --> 29:13.750
Maybe she could use a
rest, but short one, I mean.

29:13.784 --> 29:15.786
Got that softness in ya, son.

29:16.653 --> 29:18.389
Runs as deep as devilry.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.492
Sir, I hate to risk offense,

29:22.526 --> 29:24.327
but I must speak
to the contrary.

29:25.095 --> 29:25.997
That so?

29:27.663 --> 29:29.932
As I said, I hate
to risk offense,

29:29.965 --> 29:33.469
but I'm no wiltin' flower.

29:33.502 --> 29:34.937
I've done shed my
share of blood.

29:34.971 --> 29:36.274
Killed a man?

29:37.406 --> 29:38.341
Yes, sir.

29:38.375 --> 29:39.042
How many?

29:40.544 --> 29:43.013
Well, just, just the
one, but the point being.

29:43.046 --> 29:44.481
How'd that set with you?

29:46.549 --> 29:47.717
What?

29:47.750 --> 29:51.388
After the deed was done,
how'd you feel about yourself?

29:54.458 --> 29:56.594
That, right there.

29:58.461 --> 29:59.930
What right there?

29:59.962 --> 30:02.098
Remorse, regret.

30:02.132 --> 30:03.433
Call it what you will.

30:04.701 --> 30:07.070
Now you and me, Mrs. Jackson,

30:07.104 --> 30:09.440
we suffer from none such demon.

30:10.673 --> 30:12.108
Pity you weren't born a man.

30:12.142 --> 30:14.411
You'd a made one
hell of a Marshall.

30:14.443 --> 30:15.680
Parish the notion.

30:17.713 --> 30:19.716
But to you, Riggs,
you did that killin'.

30:19.750 --> 30:20.951
Was it righteous?

30:20.983 --> 30:22.819
I was defendin' myself.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.855
And yet you carried on somber.

30:26.823 --> 30:27.692
For awhile.

30:30.126 --> 30:31.095
A waste.

30:32.461 --> 30:33.564
I'm not caring if I offend,

30:33.596 --> 30:35.932
so I'm just gonna out and say

30:37.401 --> 30:39.737
if I ever thought it
possible to become so callus,

30:39.769 --> 30:42.605
so cruel and heartless,
that killin' a man

30:42.638 --> 30:44.073
gave him no cause for sorrow,

30:44.106 --> 30:46.644
prefer to become half the
killer you profess to be.

30:48.010 --> 30:49.879
Well then I think I'd
put a bullet in my skull.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.156
I just wanna talk.

33:54.663 --> 33:55.298
Looks good.

33:56.665 --> 33:58.134
That was the last of the salt.

34:00.202 --> 34:02.972
All right, you know
where we keep the stores.

34:04.340 --> 34:07.844
Come with me, Clara, please.

34:10.146 --> 34:11.648
Of course.

34:11.681 --> 34:12.949
Oh, what's ya afraid of?

34:14.650 --> 34:15.985
Dead men don't bite.

34:38.842 --> 34:40.277
What the?

34:40.309 --> 34:41.710
Were did he go?

34:54.224 --> 34:55.859
What has got you riled?

34:55.891 --> 34:56.759
He's gone.

34:57.693 --> 34:58.695
No, wait, what?

34:58.728 --> 35:00.396
That man, he's not there.

35:00.429 --> 35:01.998
Lady of the house.

35:02.032 --> 35:03.200
Who's that?

35:03.233 --> 35:04.134
What now?

35:09.838 --> 35:11.340
Speak on your intentions.

35:11.373 --> 35:15.711
It's an unfortunate
impediment, sad to say,

35:15.744 --> 35:20.116
but we three are in need of
food and shelter for the night.

35:22.184 --> 35:23.753
Are you them grave robbers?

35:28.425 --> 35:30.260
Not that I'm aware of, ma'am,

35:30.293 --> 35:31.928
I mean we have robbed some,

35:31.960 --> 35:33.663
but they were all above ground.

35:35.297 --> 35:36.866
Well you should clear on off.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.202
My husband'll be back soon.

35:39.268 --> 35:40.136
That so?

35:41.938 --> 35:42.806
It is.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.710
Ma'am, we mean you no harm,
but if you're not willing

35:47.744 --> 35:49.980
to part with some
food and water,

35:51.047 --> 35:52.382
well it's like I was saying.

35:54.317 --> 35:55.184
We rob some.

35:57.987 --> 35:59.423
You forget yourselves,

35:59.456 --> 36:01.358
seeings as I got
you in my sights.

36:02.925 --> 36:04.126
Yes, ma'am, you do.

36:04.159 --> 36:06.797
You do, and you got two
barrels on that gun.

36:06.829 --> 36:10.266
Sad part for you is that
there's three of us.

36:15.237 --> 36:16.940
So you'd harm a woman.

36:18.041 --> 36:20.277
Just what kind of vile
creatures are you?

36:22.277 --> 36:25.048
The kind that have tracked
all day over rough terrain.

36:26.215 --> 36:31.087
You know it would cause
me great, great sadness.

36:37.126 --> 36:39.395
We'll take what we need
if it ain't offered up.

36:44.867 --> 36:46.436
You leave your
pistols out here.

36:54.943 --> 36:56.846
As you would have it.

37:00.250 --> 37:01.818
C'mon, boys.

37:01.851 --> 37:03.153
Make the assistance.

37:10.460 --> 37:13.163
Is it your plan to
keep moving all night?

37:13.195 --> 37:15.364
Hoping old dogs
has found our trail.

37:16.465 --> 37:19.435
He's as close as you
say, then maybe he has.

37:19.469 --> 37:21.271
All the more reason
to keep moving.

37:23.273 --> 37:25.108
I'm asking 'cause
blisters on my feet

37:25.141 --> 37:27.110
got blisters of their own.

37:27.143 --> 37:28.278
Don't even start.

37:28.311 --> 37:29.513
You got to only
yourself to blame

37:29.545 --> 37:32.114
for having to hoof
it on the dogs.

37:32.148 --> 37:33.817
Another question, though.

37:33.849 --> 37:35.818
How far you thinkin'
of the pushin' it?

37:37.019 --> 37:38.954
I don't like this mountain.

37:38.987 --> 37:41.257
Got a way about it
stirs my senses.

37:42.992 --> 37:45.963
A darkness, a feelin'.

37:46.896 --> 37:47.965
What's the feelin'?

37:48.965 --> 37:51.534
Don't rightfully know,
something's off is all.

37:53.036 --> 37:56.139
And seein' as I ain't
gonna get a wink of sleep,

37:56.172 --> 37:58.175
well, sally forth.

38:01.911 --> 38:03.813
What about us?

38:03.847 --> 38:05.482
Rank has its privileges.

38:06.916 --> 38:07.785
Whoa, Whoa.

38:14.389 --> 38:15.324
Campfire.

38:17.126 --> 38:18.262
You stay here.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.878
Hey, hey, hey, who's there?

39:11.079 --> 39:11.949
Who is it?

39:13.382 --> 39:14.884
Help me, help me.

39:15.684 --> 39:17.487
What the hell is that?

39:17.519 --> 39:19.355
I don't know where they went.

39:19.389 --> 39:21.925
Can you get this off me
before they come back?

39:21.958 --> 39:22.626
I don't know.

39:25.061 --> 39:28.064
What do you mean
you don't know?

39:28.097 --> 39:30.267
You must've done
something awful bad

39:30.300 --> 39:32.002
to bond such creativity.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.904
As something of an expert
on inventive punishment,

39:34.938 --> 39:36.340
I do admire the work.

39:39.242 --> 39:40.143
Are you a madman?

39:43.512 --> 39:44.380
Tell me.

39:46.014 --> 39:46.884
Indians.

39:48.483 --> 39:51.554
Think I stole from 'em,
but they got it wrong.

39:51.586 --> 39:52.456
Oh yeah?

39:53.690 --> 39:54.657
Cut me loose!

39:57.059 --> 39:57.927
C'mon!

39:59.329 --> 40:00.330
All right.

40:03.132 --> 40:06.970
Ah, c'mon, just
settle yourself down.

40:07.003 --> 40:10.507
I am settled.

40:10.539 --> 40:11.440
Thank you.

40:11.474 --> 40:12.910
Don't go thankin' me just yet.

40:14.110 --> 40:16.146
There's still more
than half a chance

40:16.179 --> 40:17.414
my fingers'll slip.

40:17.447 --> 40:19.615
They got this on here
all sorts of good.

40:19.648 --> 40:21.317
Behind you!

40:23.452 --> 40:24.320
Marshall!

40:40.003 --> 40:41.371
My compliments.

40:41.403 --> 40:43.072
Mighty fine vittles, ladies.

40:52.248 --> 40:53.150
Gun shot.

41:05.594 --> 41:06.495
Marshall!

41:10.500 --> 41:12.001
Goddamn it.

41:12.034 --> 41:13.168
Marshall.

41:13.202 --> 41:15.071
Said I had a feelin'
about this place.

41:15.103 --> 41:17.606
Hey, you there,
please get this

41:17.639 --> 41:19.375
copper suckin' thing of me.

41:21.510 --> 41:23.547
I'm sorry, I have
to help the Marshall.

41:25.114 --> 41:28.552
Ma'am, I don't know how
much longer I can take.

41:30.152 --> 41:31.754
That makes two of us.

41:31.788 --> 41:32.688
Cut me loose.

41:33.688 --> 41:35.057
No.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.525
Cut me loose so I
can save this man.

41:36.559 --> 41:37.760
That ain't gonna happen.

41:37.793 --> 41:39.261
You take pressure off that
wound for more than a moment,

41:39.295 --> 41:40.496
the Marshall bleeds to death.

41:40.530 --> 41:44.534
Stay as you are and this man
dies, so cut me loose already.

41:44.567 --> 41:46.536
Don't, don't.

41:47.836 --> 41:48.672
Fuck!

41:53.809 --> 41:55.411
Okay, okay.

41:56.545 --> 41:57.413
Now do your part.

42:00.516 --> 42:01.351
Miss.

42:01.384 --> 42:02.351
Easy now, mister.

42:09.425 --> 42:11.193
Goin' for a smoke.

42:11.226 --> 42:13.797
Send Hitch on
back in here then.

42:13.829 --> 42:16.465
I don't feel safe
alone with these ones.

42:16.498 --> 42:17.366
Will do.

42:37.719 --> 42:39.355
Dalton! Get out here!

42:46.394 --> 42:47.264
Take this.

42:54.302 --> 42:56.405
Wild animal, bear maybe.

43:00.275 --> 43:01.210
Man eater.

43:03.346 --> 43:04.815
Lock the door, lock the door.

43:07.215 --> 43:08.717
She just locked us out.

43:10.219 --> 43:11.721
And she took our guns.

43:11.753 --> 43:12.889
Can you hear out there, boys?

43:12.922 --> 43:15.592
Was awful nice of you
to pay us a visit,

43:15.625 --> 43:18.293
but it's best you
clear on off now.

43:18.327 --> 43:20.463
You mean to turn us
away deprived of the means

43:20.496 --> 43:22.331
to defend ourselves!

43:22.364 --> 43:23.732
Count yourselves lucky.

43:23.766 --> 43:26.202
I'm lettin' you depart while
still standin' upright.

43:26.235 --> 43:27.671
Now get on!

43:58.601 --> 44:00.170
Okay, deep breath.

44:01.469 --> 44:03.639
That was the easy
part, sad to say.

44:03.672 --> 44:04.740
Just get on with it.

44:08.777 --> 44:10.812
I got it, okay, got it loose.

44:10.846 --> 44:12.916
Just one final pull
and you're home free.

44:15.384 --> 44:16.219
Ready?

44:24.793 --> 44:28.164
All right, time
for the Marshall.

44:36.606 --> 44:38.441
Bad as it looks, I'm afraid.

44:39.307 --> 44:40.677
I've seen worse.

44:40.710 --> 44:43.512
I've had worse, but I was
a hell of a lot younger.

44:44.646 --> 44:46.583
We're gonna have
to pull it outta ya.

44:46.615 --> 44:48.818
Fancy yourself a
doctor now too, deputy?

44:48.851 --> 44:51.421
We gotta get it outta you
before it brings on the putrid.

44:51.454 --> 44:52.956
You pull it out,
you're gonna be taking

44:52.989 --> 44:55.525
half my guts along with it.

44:55.557 --> 44:56.425
Leave it be.

44:56.458 --> 44:57.859
He's right, Riggs.

44:57.893 --> 45:00.829
All it'll cause him to
do is bleed out quicker.

45:00.862 --> 45:02.298
We have to do somethin'.

45:04.800 --> 45:06.536
You could stop talkin'.

45:06.568 --> 45:08.304
That'd be somethin'.

45:54.516 --> 45:56.752
I don't speak your words.

45:58.054 --> 45:59.521
I speak yours.

46:03.626 --> 46:07.497
This was taken off dead
one with great powers.

46:12.635 --> 46:17.540
Her spirit now free
to roam this world.

46:22.644 --> 46:25.514
I want to see right
by your friend

46:30.820 --> 46:35.825
has forced an early
end to my journey.

46:41.130 --> 46:42.965
May you find the way.

46:47.969 --> 46:49.371
You may speak our words,

46:49.405 --> 46:53.843
but I ain't making
any sense of this.

47:42.490 --> 47:43.893
It was a good ride, partner.

47:45.161 --> 47:49.565
Wish I could have gave
you a proper sendoff.

47:49.597 --> 47:52.134
But as it usually
goes with our kind,

47:52.168 --> 47:54.838
circumstances won't
allow for proper burial.

47:58.106 --> 47:58.974
Wanna.

48:02.644 --> 48:03.545
Got any shovels?

48:04.512 --> 48:05.514
In the store shed.

48:10.719 --> 48:11.653
You're burnin' up.

48:13.856 --> 48:15.825
You really should
let me see ya to bed.

48:17.059 --> 48:18.528
That's a house of death.

48:19.494 --> 48:20.929
We'll stay out here, thank you.

48:23.532 --> 48:24.800
We can see to your girl.

48:26.469 --> 48:27.137
If you like.

48:29.572 --> 48:31.941
To bury her next to
some godless outlaw?

48:38.514 --> 48:40.416
Called the great
reckonin', ma'am.

48:42.818 --> 48:44.086
Saints and sinners alike.

48:46.188 --> 48:48.758
All the recoil after the
light leaves their eyes.

48:57.632 --> 48:58.900
That man that attacked us.

48:58.934 --> 48:59.736
He was no man.

49:01.536 --> 49:02.971
Not of any natural
sort, at least.

49:03.005 --> 49:04.874
Well, I gathered that.

49:04.907 --> 49:07.477
Like those stories
folks would tell,

49:07.510 --> 49:09.545
the evil that dwells
in these lands.

49:09.577 --> 49:11.047
Haven't heard of this one.

49:11.079 --> 49:15.117
Just red man's talltales.

49:16.784 --> 49:17.653
Pray tell us.

49:22.525 --> 49:24.693
They call 'em skinwalkers.

49:24.726 --> 49:27.096
Can take on the shape
of men or beast,

49:29.264 --> 49:30.467
but they're neither.

49:31.266 --> 49:32.501
Well what then?

49:34.603 --> 49:35.605
An angry spirit.

49:37.940 --> 49:41.878
Restless 'cause they're,
they were wronged somehow.

49:42.978 --> 49:43.847
Damn.

49:45.847 --> 49:48.918
This one here came upon us
wandering out of the forest.

49:48.951 --> 49:50.519
Found a trinket on him.

49:50.552 --> 49:54.990
Her husband found an
amulet or some such.

49:55.023 --> 49:55.891
A death totem.

49:56.893 --> 49:58.193
News is, thinkin' the
man must've robbed it

49:58.226 --> 49:59.561
from an Indian grave.

50:01.195 --> 50:04.166
So he set out to return it.

50:09.905 --> 50:11.074
Your pa, you mean?

50:14.043 --> 50:14.911
Not her pa.

50:18.347 --> 50:19.249
Her husband.

50:22.784 --> 50:23.752
I thought you said that-

50:23.786 --> 50:24.820
- That's right.

50:27.690 --> 50:29.192
Both wives of Mr. Willard.

50:32.061 --> 50:33.062
Clara was too.

50:42.838 --> 50:45.173
Well, to each
their own, I suppose.

50:48.710 --> 50:49.846
How old are you, girl?

50:55.083 --> 50:55.918
13.

51:03.257 --> 51:04.860
What's that for?

51:06.762 --> 51:07.897
I didn't say a word, ma'am.

51:09.130 --> 51:11.967
You got a problem with the
way we live our lives, outlaw?

51:19.641 --> 51:20.710
No concern of mine.

51:34.956 --> 51:35.824
Sorry.

51:36.724 --> 51:38.126
I dozed off.

51:38.159 --> 51:39.161
It's the Marshall.

51:41.130 --> 51:42.898
He doesn't have long.

51:53.375 --> 51:54.242
Marshall Bascom.

52:02.451 --> 52:05.221
Some fakes I've outridden.

52:05.253 --> 52:08.257
It's the last thing I
get to see on this road

52:10.192 --> 52:14.163
is a petty little scowl
of a man who loathes me.

52:14.195 --> 52:16.665
I spoke in haste.

52:16.699 --> 52:18.835
Hastey words are honest.

52:19.934 --> 52:22.270
I'm still sorry I said 'em.

52:22.304 --> 52:23.172
I'm not.

52:24.472 --> 52:26.708
For it takes iron to tell
a mean old head hunter

52:26.742 --> 52:28.911
what you truly thin of him.

52:32.414 --> 52:35.818
And I was happy to
see ya had it in ya.

52:42.990 --> 52:43.860
Look at me.

52:47.896 --> 52:49.832
Iron is what'll keep you alive,

52:50.766 --> 52:51.968
get you off this mountain,

52:53.168 --> 52:57.440
and through the many perils
that this world has in store

52:57.472 --> 53:02.244
for those of us fool
enough where the tin star.

53:06.215 --> 53:07.850
You keep on, son.

53:11.487 --> 53:12.355
Sorry.

53:13.355 --> 53:14.222
That's

53:19.193 --> 53:20.429
Deputy Marshall.

53:48.190 --> 53:49.057
Damn.

53:50.125 --> 53:51.092
Let me see.

53:51.126 --> 53:53.095
Just leave it.

53:53.128 --> 53:54.130
I will not.

53:55.496 --> 53:56.364
That so?

53:58.266 --> 53:59.134
That hurt?

54:01.469 --> 54:02.337
That's fine.

54:03.237 --> 54:04.373
How about now?

54:04.405 --> 54:05.775
Goddamn.

54:05.807 --> 54:07.242
Okay, I'll take
that as a solid yes.

54:07.275 --> 54:08.109
Yes.

54:08.143 --> 54:09.512
It must be broken.

54:09.545 --> 54:11.347
Well, seein' as though
what you were makin' it,

54:11.380 --> 54:12.914
I'll take your word for it.

54:14.016 --> 54:15.918
You're just gonna have
to grin and bear it.

54:19.487 --> 54:20.822
Well, it needs to be set

54:20.856 --> 54:22.158
or you're gonna
wind up with a limp.

54:25.226 --> 54:26.094
Fine.

54:27.429 --> 54:29.030
I'll be as gentle as I can.

54:31.432 --> 54:32.534
Just get on with it.

54:44.880 --> 54:46.148
May I ask you where you

54:46.181 --> 54:48.016
acquired your
knowledge of medicine?

54:51.320 --> 54:54.557
One of the few slight
advantages having with an outlaw.

54:54.590 --> 54:58.094
Times often enough I've been
called on to spread remedy.

54:59.193 --> 54:59.996
I see.

55:11.306 --> 55:13.842
I wish I had a shovel.

55:13.876 --> 55:17.346
Wanna give me a
thumpin', do you?

55:17.378 --> 55:20.181
Although that might give
me some slight pleasure,

55:20.215 --> 55:21.983
I was thinking
about the Marshall.

55:25.253 --> 55:26.188
It's not fair.

55:27.922 --> 55:32.560
He didn't deserve this,
dying on this mountain.

55:32.594 --> 55:34.297
Becoming food for
these critters.

55:35.664 --> 55:38.000
Few end up where
they deserve, Riggs.

55:42.371 --> 55:44.173
Guess there's
some truth in that.

55:47.275 --> 55:48.911
Why you helpin' me, Masie?

55:50.244 --> 55:51.579
What do you mean?

55:51.612 --> 55:54.048
Makin' me
so your husband and his men

55:54.081 --> 55:55.217
can come cut me down.

55:58.253 --> 55:59.121
It's finished.

56:00.454 --> 56:02.991
It's best if you can keep
your weight off of it.

56:05.226 --> 56:07.163
Fine chance of that.

56:12.668 --> 56:14.403
Good night, Riggs.

56:15.403 --> 56:16.271
Yeah.

56:28.684 --> 56:30.253
Hole's big enough for two.

56:32.054 --> 56:33.255
You mean bury 'em together.

56:33.288 --> 56:35.990
I don't care if she
stays above ground,

56:36.023 --> 56:37.492
as long as I don't have
to dig another hole.

56:37.525 --> 56:38.426
Savages.

56:40.494 --> 56:41.931
What was that?

56:41.963 --> 56:42.632
Nothing.

56:43.597 --> 56:44.666
Good.

56:44.699 --> 56:48.169
It's just, she
deserves better, is all.

56:50.672 --> 56:52.141
Of that I have no doubt.

56:55.610 --> 56:58.681
You think there's any sense
to what that child was sayin'?

56:58.713 --> 56:59.547
Nope.

57:01.983 --> 57:03.217
Doesn't mean it
ain't true though.

57:03.251 --> 57:05.254
Never seen a man
like that before.

57:07.054 --> 57:09.157
There's a darkness in him.

57:09.190 --> 57:10.492
Like a rabbid wolf.

57:13.128 --> 57:15.965
I guess an evil spirit's
as good an answer as any.

57:15.998 --> 57:17.934
You know, I'm
long past exhausted.

57:19.601 --> 57:21.436
Should try and get some rest.

57:21.469 --> 57:23.972
Gonna need your strength
for when we run into Bascom.

57:24.005 --> 57:25.473
That goes for both of us.

57:25.507 --> 57:29.445
We got the element of
surprise, but one gun short.

57:31.079 --> 57:32.481
No cause for concern to me.

57:34.349 --> 57:36.318
You've never heard the
same stories of Bascom

57:36.351 --> 57:37.452
that I've heard.

57:37.485 --> 57:39.087
Man's got my Masie.

57:40.222 --> 57:42.358
Sure is pain if it be
him who shits the brick.

58:02.077 --> 58:02.745
Judith?

58:31.139 --> 58:33.675
Judith, what's wrong?

58:35.242 --> 58:36.478
It's taking me.

58:38.813 --> 58:40.048
Stay away.

58:41.583 --> 58:45.086
No, I can't leave you.

58:45.119 --> 58:46.154
Run, Nelly!

58:48.190 --> 58:49.592
I'll bring help!

59:51.652 --> 59:53.355
How far is this
cabin of yours?

59:56.490 --> 59:58.293
Less than an hour's ride.

59:58.326 --> 59:59.394
What about on foot?

01:00:01.228 --> 01:00:02.097
Why?

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.800
Horses got away
from us in the night.

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:06.501
That, or somebody stole 'em.

01:00:07.601 --> 01:00:09.504
Subduction just
keeps getting better.

01:00:10.605 --> 01:00:11.840
You all right to travel?

01:00:14.242 --> 01:00:15.410
Yeah.

01:00:15.443 --> 01:00:16.545
You all right?

01:00:17.545 --> 01:00:18.681
Not particularly.

01:00:19.947 --> 01:00:21.516
Seein' as we got no choice.

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:30.726
Judith!

01:00:35.396 --> 01:00:37.365
Take my hand, Judith.

01:00:37.398 --> 01:00:38.800
Take my hand, Judith.

01:00:41.202 --> 01:00:42.637
Keep away from her.

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:43.905
No!

01:00:43.938 --> 01:00:46.207
Can you see she's
sick, girl, she's sick.

01:00:46.942 --> 01:00:48.811
We need to help her.

01:00:51.579 --> 01:00:52.882
Don't move any closer.

01:00:55.717 --> 01:00:58.354
You can't leave me like this.

01:01:13.335 --> 01:01:14.202
That gunfire?

01:01:15.603 --> 01:01:16.838
Well, they just hunters.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.443
Bet ya that's Festicate,
not far from my homestead.

01:01:21.675 --> 01:01:22.911
No!

01:02:05.387 --> 01:02:06.622
Agh!

01:02:06.655 --> 01:02:07.589
Fuck!

01:02:07.621 --> 01:02:08.956
Jesus.

01:02:08.989 --> 01:02:09.857
Goddammit.

01:02:11.425 --> 01:02:12.293
Jesus.

01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:27.909
Whatever it was took
over that woman,

01:02:29.777 --> 01:02:31.746
she passed it to
me, I'm sure of it.

01:02:32.847 --> 01:02:33.916
Talkin' crazy.

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:37.253
I know.

01:02:39.753 --> 01:02:42.456
You saw for yourself the
way that woman turned.

01:02:42.489 --> 01:02:44.759
Well, maybe she's just
saddened by the loss

01:02:44.793 --> 01:02:45.861
of her sister wives.

01:02:47.027 --> 01:02:47.895
No.

01:02:51.432 --> 01:02:54.635
I can feel it.

01:02:54.668 --> 01:02:55.836
How?

01:02:55.869 --> 01:02:58.706
Can't put words to
it, it's just a feelin'.

01:03:01.076 --> 01:03:02.644
I know I'm gonna be like her.

01:03:03.577 --> 01:03:04.746
What are you gonna do?

01:03:10.518 --> 01:03:13.789
I think you know
the answer to that.

01:03:13.822 --> 01:03:15.057
Oh, hell no.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:15.990
Hell, yes.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.929
Believe me, old friend,
you'd me showin' me favor.

01:03:23.697 --> 01:03:26.499
Not yet.

01:03:28.769 --> 01:03:31.706
It was a night and a morning
for old girl lost her marbles,

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.608
so we have some time.

01:03:34.641 --> 01:03:35.510
Time?

01:03:39.581 --> 01:03:40.449
Find Masie.

01:03:42.449 --> 01:03:43.785
Hold her one more time while

01:03:46.987 --> 01:03:48.523
I still have hold of myself.

01:03:51.559 --> 01:03:52.561
Can you hold firm?

01:04:00.168 --> 01:04:03.771
Let's go pay a visit
to Marshall Bascom.

01:04:07.007 --> 01:04:08.609
You hear that?

01:04:08.643 --> 01:04:09.978
Hear what?

01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:12.614
Real faint, but it
sounded like voices.

01:04:12.646 --> 01:04:14.014
Natives?

01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:14.916
I don't know.

01:04:16.518 --> 01:04:20.422
Small breeze, rustle
in the trees maybe.

01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:23.958
'Cause you never hear an
Indian unless he wants you to.

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:25.127
Yeah, probably right.

01:04:27.429 --> 01:04:29.431
Let's keep goin' then.

01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:36.003
Not fairin' so well.

01:04:37.137 --> 01:04:39.440
I'll be fine, I
just need a minute.

01:04:45.713 --> 01:04:46.681
You know, you
could hole up here.

01:04:46.713 --> 01:04:49.518
I could find Masie and
bring her back to you.

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:56.392
Leave you to take
Bascom and his men alone?

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:58.960
No offense, but I'm
wondering how much

01:04:58.992 --> 01:05:00.528
you should be to fight any.

01:05:06.201 --> 01:05:07.536
Suppose that's fair.

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.740
This just ain't right.

01:05:12.773 --> 01:05:13.674
I'll manage it.

01:05:14.943 --> 01:05:16.178
I mean this whole thing.

01:05:20.815 --> 01:05:23.085
Hitch, Elmer.

01:05:27.121 --> 01:05:28.157
Ain't no money in it.

01:05:30.090 --> 01:05:31.592
Everything considerin',
you should be trying

01:05:31.626 --> 01:05:32.627
to lengthen the
distance between you

01:05:32.659 --> 01:05:34.429
and the likes of Bascom.

01:05:35.663 --> 01:05:38.634
I'm just a much a sentimental
fool as you, I guess.

01:05:41.568 --> 01:05:43.771
You're a good
man, Vernon Wesley.

01:05:43.804 --> 01:05:44.806
I wouldn't go that far,

01:05:44.838 --> 01:05:46.574
but we take care
of our own kind.

01:05:52.713 --> 01:05:53.815
Honor among thieves.

01:05:54.849 --> 01:05:55.717
Yeah.

01:06:03.992 --> 01:06:06.760
I got a little problem
leading ya, friend.

01:06:06.793 --> 01:06:08.629
You're weight's
gettin' overbearing.

01:06:09.597 --> 01:06:10.666
I gotta stop.

01:06:12.666 --> 01:06:13.634
How much further?

01:06:14.568 --> 01:06:15.603
Almost there.

01:06:16.603 --> 01:06:21.609
Just over that ridge.

01:06:22.744 --> 01:06:24.946
Hey, where you goin'?

01:06:24.978 --> 01:06:27.615
Just over that ridge.

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:28.650
Goddammit.

01:06:37.759 --> 01:06:38.726
My god.

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:39.628
Vern!

01:06:41.028 --> 01:06:42.597
Well, I'll
be damned, Masie.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:43.565
Vern.

01:06:43.597 --> 01:06:45.634
How the hell you'd
get away from Bascom?

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.835
Well, long story.

01:06:47.869 --> 01:06:48.937
How the hell you'd find me?

01:06:48.969 --> 01:06:50.271
That's an even longer story.

01:06:50.304 --> 01:06:51.205
Dalton with you?

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:55.743
What?

01:06:55.777 --> 01:06:57.112
What's wrong?

01:06:57.144 --> 01:06:59.581
He up a short ways from here.

01:06:59.614 --> 01:07:02.650
Before you see him,
he ain't go long.

01:07:05.887 --> 01:07:08.256
Goddamn, where is she?

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:10.057
You got an eye
for her, I think.

01:07:11.159 --> 01:07:12.794
Think again, partner.

01:07:12.827 --> 01:07:14.229
She's a married woman.

01:07:14.262 --> 01:07:16.798
And that's the river
callin' ya all on across.

01:07:18.932 --> 01:07:20.235
Very happy to hear it.

01:07:21.168 --> 01:07:22.036
Hold on.

01:07:28.943 --> 01:07:30.245
It's who she's married to

01:07:30.277 --> 01:07:32.680
that makes it all so
easy to avoid temptation.

01:07:33.847 --> 01:07:35.650
And who might that be?

01:07:35.682 --> 01:07:37.219
A lowdown outlaw.

01:07:40.954 --> 01:07:42.690
Speaking of lowdown outlaws.

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:50.699
Vern?

01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:54.336
Who's there?

01:07:54.369 --> 01:07:55.336
Speak out!

01:07:59.974 --> 01:08:01.109
Masie.

01:08:01.141 --> 01:08:02.143
Dalton.

01:08:02.175 --> 01:08:03.244
Masie.

01:08:03.277 --> 01:08:04.880
It's me, Dalton.

01:08:06.914 --> 01:08:08.350
Don't touch me girl.

01:08:08.382 --> 01:08:09.384
Don't come no closer.

01:08:09.416 --> 01:08:10.250
Why?

01:08:10.284 --> 01:08:11.251
Don't, agh.

01:08:11.284 --> 01:08:12.686
Dalton.

01:08:12.719 --> 01:08:13.721
Ah, Jesus!

01:08:13.755 --> 01:08:15.624
Just run.

01:08:15.657 --> 01:08:17.792
What's happening to you?

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.865
I just wanted to
see ya one more time.

01:08:24.899 --> 01:08:26.701
Dalton, you're scaring me.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:29.404
Keep your eyes open.

01:08:29.435 --> 01:08:34.108
Stop, stop, stop!

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:35.376
Keep your eyes open.

01:08:39.747 --> 01:08:40.749
Wake up, Dalton.

01:08:47.421 --> 01:08:49.724
Wake up, wake up, Dalton.

01:09:01.935 --> 01:09:03.304
What is it, what?

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:05.372
Run, Masie!

01:09:05.404 --> 01:09:06.774
No, I'm not leaving you.

01:09:06.807 --> 01:09:11.813
Goddammit, woman.

01:09:12.912 --> 01:09:14.715
What are you doing?

01:09:15.817 --> 01:09:17.185
Get the hell
outta here, Masie.

01:09:17.216 --> 01:09:18.920
I'm not leaving you!

01:09:18.953 --> 01:09:21.790
Get the hell
outta here, Maise!

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:24.292
What are you doing?

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:29.729
Masie, god dammit!

01:09:36.904 --> 01:09:37.773
Dalton!

01:09:38.904 --> 01:09:39.774
Dalton!

01:09:41.242 --> 01:09:43.877
Keep your hands where
I can see 'em, law dog.

01:09:43.911 --> 01:09:45.046
Trying to help wounded man.

01:09:45.078 --> 01:09:46.180
Keep your eyes forward

01:09:46.212 --> 01:09:48.684
and let me worry
about gimpy Joe there.

01:09:49.817 --> 01:09:51.920
You were saying
Bascom was cut down

01:09:51.953 --> 01:09:53.787
by a couple of redskins?

01:09:53.819 --> 01:09:55.189
You expect me to believe that?

01:09:55.222 --> 01:09:56.925
I don't care what you believe.

01:09:58.192 --> 01:10:00.328
Dalton!

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.796
Masie!

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:47.509
You all right?

01:10:47.542 --> 01:10:49.244
I can't make
any sense of this.

01:10:51.845 --> 01:10:53.380
He was dead, Vern.

01:10:53.413 --> 01:10:54.948
My Dalton.

01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:58.886
One moment his heart had
stopped and he was awake again.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.188
Only-

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:01.756
- He was changed.

01:11:03.157 --> 01:11:04.292
Like a man possessed.

01:11:05.225 --> 01:11:06.127
Where'd he go?

01:11:10.264 --> 01:11:11.132
Masie.

01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:13.868
That way.

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:15.069
Into the forest.

01:11:18.171 --> 01:11:20.908
Look here, this
is very important.

01:11:23.211 --> 01:11:24.378
Did he touch ya?

01:11:28.048 --> 01:11:29.050
Are you sure?

01:11:33.186 --> 01:11:34.890
I lay my hand upon his forehead.

01:11:35.957 --> 01:11:37.592
He didn't scratch
ya or nothin'?

01:11:37.625 --> 01:11:39.795
Why does that matter?

01:11:41.028 --> 01:11:43.231
You know I was
talking to Ms. Jackson.

01:11:43.264 --> 01:11:47.101
No, he seemed set on
avoiding me altogether.

01:11:47.134 --> 01:11:49.337
Why don't you tell us
what's goin' on here?

01:11:52.606 --> 01:11:55.443
It's a way this thing
seems to function.

01:11:55.475 --> 01:11:59.246
Has to draw blood to move
from one soul to another.

01:12:00.948 --> 01:12:02.350
Lost your marbles, friend.

01:12:02.382 --> 01:12:03.984
Well, I ain't your friend,

01:12:04.018 --> 01:12:07.255
and as far as I'm concerned,
it can take ya all to hell.

01:12:07.287 --> 01:12:09.890
My only concern is
for Ms. Masie alone

01:12:09.923 --> 01:12:12.092
and getting her off
this goddamn mountain.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.395
You should let her rest.

01:12:14.427 --> 01:12:16.530
Homestead is just a
stone's throw from here.

01:12:16.564 --> 01:12:19.234
And what are you,
the Sultan of Persia?

01:12:20.434 --> 01:12:21.603
I don't take your meaning.

01:12:21.636 --> 01:12:23.938
You know the man
with all them wives,

01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:25.339
he kept 'em for himself.

01:12:25.372 --> 01:12:26.507
What about my wife?

01:12:29.042 --> 01:12:29.911
They're dead.

01:12:30.845 --> 01:12:33.248
Two of 'em anyway
and the youngest one,

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.381
she ran off somewhere.

01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:38.253
You run off my wife.

01:12:42.122 --> 01:12:44.658
And you remove all
notions of heroics.

01:12:44.692 --> 01:12:47.194
I ain't the one that
pillaged your harem.

01:12:48.095 --> 01:12:50.597
I may be a low down highway man,

01:12:50.631 --> 01:12:53.368
but I've never laid a
hand on the fairer kind

01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.569
as Ms. Jackson can attest to.

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:58.506
Now you take my words as truth.

01:12:58.538 --> 01:13:01.576
There ain't nothin'
back there but corpses,

01:13:01.609 --> 01:13:03.678
and you do as you like.

01:13:03.711 --> 01:13:05.547
My concern is for Masie.

01:13:07.148 --> 01:13:08.449
I'm not going anywhere.

01:13:10.251 --> 01:13:11.085
Hey.

01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:11.987
Not without Dalton.

01:13:15.155 --> 01:13:17.457
You said it yourself,
Dalton's dead.

01:13:17.490 --> 01:13:18.693
You seen him expire.

01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:21.061
I was mistaken.

01:13:21.095 --> 01:13:21.996
You weren't.

01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:23.465
I was, I must've been.

01:13:25.432 --> 01:13:26.333
He went off that way.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:27.268
I'm gonna go follow.

01:13:27.301 --> 01:13:29.271
Forgive me for being familiar.

01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:51.992
Dalton!

01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:52.693
Come now.

01:13:53.661 --> 01:13:54.663
Almost there.

01:13:56.262 --> 01:14:00.033
Hey, I'm leaking like a sieve.

01:14:00.067 --> 01:14:02.136
Ah, busted open again.

01:14:02.168 --> 01:14:03.037
Damn me.

01:14:04.204 --> 01:14:05.206
Oh, damn me.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:09.077
Give me a beat or
two, I gotta sit down.

01:14:17.184 --> 01:14:18.586
Have my pistol back, please.

01:14:20.387 --> 01:14:21.256
Thank you.

01:14:25.225 --> 01:14:26.360
Hold it, don't shoot.

01:14:47.747 --> 01:14:50.351
I know it's you, old friend.

01:15:09.537 --> 01:15:10.405
Nelly?

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.612
I feel a fever coming over me.

01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:25.153
I can't make it back
to the cabin by myself.

01:15:30.858 --> 01:15:32.560
Why you being so cold to me?

01:15:34.528 --> 01:15:35.396
Is it true?

01:15:37.097 --> 01:15:38.432
Are Judith and Clara really?

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:49.577
Oh my god.

01:15:51.712 --> 01:15:52.580
Ow.

01:16:07.494 --> 01:16:09.497
You know his words?

01:16:09.529 --> 01:16:10.398
Some of it.

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:17.572
She was a noble woman.

01:16:25.712 --> 01:16:28.315
Let us go across the plains.

01:16:28.349 --> 01:16:29.217
Here we live.

01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:35.489
Lakota, Navajo, Apache, all
as one people, one tribe.

01:16:45.498 --> 01:16:48.403
Led us to this
mountain, our new home.

01:16:58.645 --> 01:17:01.681
But something turned in her.

01:17:01.715 --> 01:17:03.118
A dark and ancient evil.

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:13.226
In her madness, Red Feather
led us in rebellion.

01:17:17.264 --> 01:17:21.234
Before she died, she swore
that she would return.

01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:29.676
What was that last part?

01:17:33.881 --> 01:17:34.816
And now she has.

01:17:37.618 --> 01:17:39.187
Who has?

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:40.922
What does any of this mean?

01:17:45.826 --> 01:17:47.561
When her grave was disturbed.

01:17:50.831 --> 01:17:51.932
She awoke a...

01:18:01.742 --> 01:18:02.677
Skinwalker.

01:18:04.612 --> 01:18:07.215
What's a skinwalker?

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:08.282
Shapeshifter.

01:18:09.515 --> 01:18:11.284
It can turn from beast to man.

01:18:18.492 --> 01:18:20.561
Here spirit will
travel at will,

01:18:20.594 --> 01:18:22.462
from one living body to another.

01:18:29.603 --> 01:18:32.507
One whose heart still
beats, blood she's drawn.

01:18:36.476 --> 01:18:37.345
Fairytales.

01:18:39.345 --> 01:18:43.717
No, legend says
dark and ancient evil

01:18:43.751 --> 01:18:45.886
will move from
creature to creature,

01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:47.354
killing all in its path.

01:18:48.622 --> 01:18:50.725
And they can't be killed.

01:18:50.757 --> 01:18:51.626
No.

01:18:56.029 --> 01:18:57.931
This is very interesting, but.

01:18:57.965 --> 01:18:58.800
The amulet.

01:19:01.034 --> 01:19:02.135
What?

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:05.038
That Indian gave you
before he died, give it here.

01:19:05.072 --> 01:19:05.905
Why?

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:06.807
Just do it.

01:19:14.648 --> 01:19:15.550
This was hers?

01:19:16.516 --> 01:19:17.385
Return it to her.

01:19:17.417 --> 01:19:18.385
Here, take it.

01:19:34.967 --> 01:19:36.037
It made your husband
an evil spirit.

01:19:36.069 --> 01:19:36.938
No!

01:19:59.926 --> 01:20:01.394
Holy cow.

01:20:36.563 --> 01:20:38.666
We need to go.

01:20:38.698 --> 01:20:40.734
Preachin' to the choir.

01:20:52.179 --> 01:20:53.081
What now?

01:21:07.627 --> 01:21:08.929
Don't fall.

01:21:08.962 --> 01:21:09.831
Okay.

01:21:21.908 --> 01:21:22.777
Girl.

01:21:26.779 --> 01:21:29.817
All right, made
believers out of us.

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:30.718
Quiet.

01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:37.158
Some kind of ritual?

01:21:37.190 --> 01:21:38.759
Yes, must be calling
on her soul to return

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:39.794
to the spirit world.

01:21:41.929 --> 01:21:44.132
Looks like we just
ran out of praying time.

01:21:45.231 --> 01:21:45.865
Stay back.

01:21:48.734 --> 01:21:51.104
I know what's goin' on here.

01:21:52.104 --> 01:21:54.674
I know what's happening to me.

01:21:58.177 --> 01:22:01.181
I just wanted to
say goodbye, Nelly.

01:22:08.855 --> 01:22:10.425
Do what you gotta do.

01:24:55.154 --> 01:24:57.358
What the hell was that!

01:24:57.390 --> 01:24:59.225
Something no one
would ever believe.

01:24:59.259 --> 01:25:01.962
Hell, I saw it and I
don't even believe it.

01:25:01.994 --> 01:25:02.863
Wait!

01:25:04.096 --> 01:25:05.832
Where are you going?

01:25:08.268 --> 01:25:10.837
I'd say he's got
the right of it.

01:25:22.983 --> 01:25:24.385
All right, then.

01:25:27.453 --> 01:25:29.389
Off to Brisky Junction.

01:25:57.117 --> 01:25:58.386
So California, is it?

01:26:01.054 --> 01:26:04.324
Or Chicago, New York, even.

01:26:04.356 --> 01:26:06.292
Run as far as you can.

01:26:06.326 --> 01:26:07.761
No shame in that.

01:26:07.793 --> 01:26:08.762
No, none at all.

01:26:09.962 --> 01:26:11.998
But take heed because
it's a hell of a way

01:26:12.032 --> 01:26:12.967
to live your life.

01:26:13.934 --> 01:26:16.804
Lord knows I had to find
that out the hard way.

01:26:16.837 --> 01:26:17.705
Yes.

01:26:19.805 --> 01:26:21.107
And don't marry an outlaw.

01:26:22.341 --> 01:26:24.811
I'm not likely to be
marrying anybody again.

01:26:26.179 --> 01:26:28.015
She's smart beyond her years.

01:26:32.519 --> 01:26:33.387
Ladies.

01:26:39.126 --> 01:26:43.463
Trip to California and
some spending cash.

01:26:44.898 --> 01:26:46.867
I can't take
your money, deputy.

01:26:46.899 --> 01:26:48.101
Already have miss.

01:26:48.135 --> 01:26:50.503
I don't wanna hear
another word on it.

01:26:50.537 --> 01:26:52.073
I don't have words for it.

01:26:53.472 --> 01:26:55.176
I'm grateful, sir, truly.

01:26:56.976 --> 01:26:58.211
And after I find work, I can-

01:26:58.244 --> 01:26:59.113
- Sure.

01:26:59.979 --> 01:27:02.148
If for some godforsaken reason

01:27:02.181 --> 01:27:04.150
you find yourself
back in the territory,

01:27:04.184 --> 01:27:08.122
but for your sake, Nelly,
I hope this is the last

01:27:08.154 --> 01:27:09.222
we see of each other.

01:27:11.957 --> 01:27:13.993
Thank you, Nat.

01:27:20.934 --> 01:27:23.170
All right, go on then,
don't miss your train.

01:27:23.203 --> 01:27:24.205
Be well, Nelly.

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.481
She called you Nat.

01:27:35.515 --> 01:27:37.284
A lot of my friends do.

01:27:37.317 --> 01:27:41.421
Well, got some
unfinished business.

01:27:42.922 --> 01:27:46.159
I know the jail house ain't
far, but salon's closer.

01:27:47.426 --> 01:27:49.028
Buy me a drink
before turning me in?

01:27:52.998 --> 01:27:54.300
It'll get you as
far as California,

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:58.005
but if I was you,
I'd get on a ship

01:27:58.037 --> 01:28:00.273
and I'd sail to
China or something.

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.641
Grace.

01:28:02.676 --> 01:28:07.114
I ain't letting you go, but
I'll give you a head start.

01:28:08.849 --> 01:28:12.286
China, I heard it's
lovely this time of year.

01:28:17.923 --> 01:28:20.060
You're a kind man, deputy.

01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:27.168
Thank you, Riggs.

01:28:29.903 --> 01:28:31.539
Friends call me Nat.

01:28:32.471 --> 01:28:34.340
I think is still prefer Riggs.

01:28:36.376 --> 01:28:37.244
As you like it.

01:28:39.511 --> 01:28:40.947
Take care of yourself.

01:28:43.216 --> 01:28:44.485
Yeah, you too.

01:29:27.359 --> 01:29:28.194
Is this seat taken?

01:29:28.228 --> 01:29:29.630
Ms. Jackson.

01:29:29.662 --> 01:29:30.530
In the flesh.

01:29:33.132 --> 01:29:36.403
Today's news, latest and
greatest in the territory.

01:29:37.404 --> 01:29:38.639
Thank you.

01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:41.274
Extra,
extra, today's news.

01:29:48.247 --> 01:29:49.115
Sergeant.

01:29:50.283 --> 01:29:51.151
Colonel's coming.

01:29:55.721 --> 01:29:57.291
Found another dead body, sir.

01:29:57.323 --> 01:29:59.058
This one down by the river.

01:29:59.091 --> 01:30:00.126
What the hell happened?

01:30:00.159 --> 01:30:01.427
Don't rightly know, sir.

01:30:02.561 --> 01:30:04.331
Well, back to
the task at hand.

01:30:04.363 --> 01:30:06.532
Meeting some resent
from the natives.

01:30:06.565 --> 01:30:09.168
Chief Red Feather tells
them this is their mountain,

01:30:09.202 --> 01:30:10.905
sacred birthright of the people.

01:30:22.282 --> 01:30:23.350
What is all this?

01:30:25.985 --> 01:30:27.386
Haven't you heard?

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:29.623
All the Indians have been
ordered off this mountain.

01:30:54.113 --> 01:30:55.081
What's this?

01:30:56.483 --> 01:30:58.018
Mountain yours.

01:31:29.181 --> 01:31:31.417
Nelly, you feeling okay?

01:31:39.807 --> 01:31:44.807
