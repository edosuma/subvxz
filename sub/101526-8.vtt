WEBVTT

00:06.159 --> 00:08.576
This one guy I knew, this gangster

00:08.826 --> 00:10.534
we called him the Violin Man.

00:10.618 --> 00:11.576
He was born into nobility

00:11.659 --> 00:13.493
and he played
from when he was like 2 years old.

00:13.576 --> 00:15.367
No one plays the violin
when they're 2 years old.

00:15.451 --> 00:16.284
Sure they do.

00:16.493 --> 00:17.868
They don't make violins that small.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.451
To a baby like that,
it'd be like playing a fucking cello.

00:20.534 --> 00:21.951
Okay.
2, 3, whatever.

00:22.075 --> 00:25.659
The point is, his family
was killed off in the revolution

00:25.951 --> 00:28.075
and he wound up out on the streets.

00:28.159 --> 00:31.075
Turned out he could scrap
like a motherfucker.

00:31.159 --> 00:32.201
He joined a Tong.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.534
After a while, his hands
got so fucked up from the fights

00:36.034 --> 00:37.201
he couldn't play anymore.

00:37.284 --> 00:39.951
So he pulled the strings
off of his violin..

00:40.034 --> 00:42.826
His tiny violin.
- No, he was older now.

00:42.910 --> 00:44.242
You guys are fucking up my story.

00:44.743 --> 00:47.743
Anyway, he pulled the strings
off his violin

00:48.075 --> 00:49.326
and he would carry them with him.

00:49.743 --> 00:50.951
And when he killed people

00:51.034 --> 00:53.034
he would choke them out
with the same violin strings

00:53.117 --> 00:54.910
he used to play fucking Mozart with.

00:55.034 --> 00:56.576
Hence, the Violin Man.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.743
How did we get on this topic?

00:59.826 --> 01:01.367
You asked him
why he fights with that rope.

01:01.451 --> 01:04.201
Oh, yeah.
What's the connection?

01:04.284 --> 01:05.784
It's my trademark, man.

01:05.868 --> 01:09.159
The Violin Man had his strings,
I have my chain.

01:09.701 --> 01:11.117
Did you play Mozart on it?

01:12.075 --> 01:13.034
What?

01:14.034 --> 01:14.951
No.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.367
Then I don't get it.
- Me either.

01:21.618 --> 01:23.075
Fuck you guys!

01:26.659 --> 01:28.034
"The Rope Man."

01:28.159 --> 01:29.159
Come on.

01:29.576 --> 01:31.201
That doesn't have
the same ring to it.

01:31.409 --> 01:33.159
It's not a rope, it's a chain.

01:34.618 --> 01:37.242
Rope Man, you tell
any Fung Hai still breathing

01:37.659 --> 01:38.743
they work for us now.

01:41.075 --> 01:42.910
I don't think
anyone is still breathing.

01:46.701 --> 01:47.784
That works, too.

03:28.201 --> 03:29.159
Ready.

03:29.826 --> 03:30.784
Nice and sharp.

03:42.159 --> 03:43.117
There you go.

03:44.576 --> 03:47.075
No!
No! No!

03:47.367 --> 03:49.409
You get the hell away from me!

03:53.493 --> 03:55.951
Damn it.
Someone get something in his mouth!

03:56.284 --> 03:57.409
Please.
We're trying to help you.

03:57.493 --> 03:59.826
Get off me! Don't!
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!

03:59.910 --> 04:02.576
No, no!
Don't take it! Don't! Do..

04:02.826 --> 04:04.367
Please, don't!
Don't!

04:04.451 --> 04:07.868
Don't take my leg!
Don't take my leg!

04:09.159 --> 04:10.618
Please!
- I'm sorry.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.075
I-It's too far gone.

04:12.701 --> 04:14.451
No.
- It will be over soon.

04:14.534 --> 04:15.493
No.

04:16.117 --> 04:17.242
I promise.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.284
Mr. Buckley.

04:48.784 --> 04:50.242
Mr. Buckley, wake up!

04:56.284 --> 04:57.534
Yes?
What is it?

04:57.618 --> 04:58.784
The police are here.

05:06.868 --> 05:08.159
How long ago?

05:09.367 --> 05:11.034
An hour, maybe two.

05:12.701 --> 05:13.743
Neighbors heard shouting.

05:13.826 --> 05:15.659
They saw someone
running away from the house.

05:16.075 --> 05:17.576
Sent a footman to the station.

05:19.242 --> 05:20.951
Jesus.
What a mess.

05:23.367 --> 05:24.951
Has Mrs. Blake made a statement?

05:25.075 --> 05:26.034
Not yet.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.451
I thought it best not to press her
until you arrived.

05:35.284 --> 05:36.493
You did the right thing.

05:47.951 --> 05:49.326
Mrs. Blake, are you hurt?

05:53.284 --> 05:54.826
Can you tell me what happened here?

05:58.743 --> 06:00.534
Your husband
has been killed, Mrs. Blake

06:00.618 --> 06:02.284
and you've clearly
been in a struggle.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.117
I'm gonna need you to speak.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.826
Did you kill your husband,
Mrs. Blake?

06:12.826 --> 06:13.951
He was drunk.

06:14.618 --> 06:15.910
He attacked me.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.451
So you were defending yourself?

06:19.493 --> 06:22.034
He was strangling me.
I-I couldn't breathe.

06:28.534 --> 06:30.034
The thing is, Mrs. Blake

06:30.534 --> 06:32.576
your husband was hit
on the back of the head

06:32.659 --> 06:34.242
with a poker, by the looks of it.

06:35.409 --> 06:37.701
You couldn't have hit him like that
if he was strangling you.

06:38.618 --> 06:39.743
I don't know.

06:42.951 --> 06:44.743
It all happened so quickly.

06:46.034 --> 06:47.910
Perhaps, your sister saw
what was happening

06:47.951 --> 06:49.367
and came to your aid?
- No.

06:50.075 --> 06:52.493
She tried,
but he threw her into a wall.

06:53.534 --> 06:56.201
So, if not her..

07:08.284 --> 07:10.075
It was Jacob.
- Sophie! - What's this now?

07:10.159 --> 07:12.075
I'm not letting you go to jail
for something you didn't do.

07:12.159 --> 07:13.493
She's confused.
She hit her head.

07:13.576 --> 07:14.701
Samuel was trying to kill her!

07:14.784 --> 07:16.784
Jacob, he hit him,
but he was defending her.

07:16.868 --> 07:18.326
That is not what happened!
- Excuse me!

07:18.409 --> 07:20.159
Mrs. Blake, what are you doing?

07:21.784 --> 07:24.326
Jacob's not a murderer.

07:24.409 --> 07:27.117
The Mayor of San Francisco
has been killed in his own home.

07:27.201 --> 07:28.784
Someone is gonna be arrested
for murder.

07:28.868 --> 07:30.034
Now it can be you

07:30.367 --> 07:32.910
or it can be the man
who actually killed him.

07:35.159 --> 07:38.409
Or maybe it wasn't him.
Maybe it was your sister.

07:40.868 --> 07:42.743
No.
- Is he still in the house?

07:45.868 --> 07:47.075
Search the house to be sure

07:47.159 --> 07:49.659
but I suspect we'll need
to track down this Chinaman, Jacob.

07:49.743 --> 07:50.743
Please!

07:51.242 --> 07:53.659
He was just defending me.
- Of course, he was.

07:53.743 --> 07:56.034
But fleeing the scene
isn't helping his case.

07:56.284 --> 07:58.784
I think we should leave
Mrs. Blake and Ms. Mercer to recover.

07:58.868 --> 08:00.493
They've been through
a terrible ordeal.

08:03.409 --> 08:04.868
I'll leave a man on the door.

08:06.701 --> 08:09.576
Chief Flannagan,
may I speak to you for a moment?

08:17.618 --> 08:18.826
So, what do you think?

08:19.576 --> 08:22.159
I think it's clear.
The Mayor was murdered by a Chinaman.

08:22.242 --> 08:23.201
You say it like that

08:23.284 --> 08:25.117
we'll have pandemonium
in the streets.

08:25.201 --> 08:26.659
And that's why
we're gonna stay ahead of it.

08:26.743 --> 08:28.826
We're gonna search
every inch of Chinatown.

08:29.534 --> 08:31.493
Can we pull policemen
from other beats?

08:31.576 --> 08:33.451
I suppose that's up to you now.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.618
You're the acting Mayor.

08:37.493 --> 08:40.159
Yes, I suppose I am.

08:42.618 --> 08:44.618
Every badge you can muster,
first thing in the morning.

08:44.701 --> 08:46.659
I want a large scale
and very visible manhunt

08:46.743 --> 08:48.951
already underway
before we announce the Mayor's death.

08:49.075 --> 08:50.743
Do you understand?
- Do you want me to put on a show?

08:50.826 --> 08:51.784
A big one.

08:52.034 --> 08:54.201
I wanna keep the city calm
and catch a murderer.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.242
That'll take some doing.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.075
For one thing,
we don't know what he looks like.

08:57.159 --> 08:58.367
Just get it started.

08:58.451 --> 09:00.992
It's important that the people know
we're on top of things.

09:01.117 --> 09:03.659
Even when we aren't?
- Especially then.

09:17.743 --> 09:19.201
I don't understand
why we don't just burn

09:19.284 --> 09:21.659
this fucking place to the ground,
send a message.

09:22.034 --> 09:24.034
Our colors
on the Fung Hai headquarters

09:24.117 --> 09:25.493
is the message

09:25.576 --> 09:27.701
one Mai Ling
has to live with every day.

09:28.242 --> 09:31.659
The longer she waits to retaliate,
the weaker she looks.

09:32.659 --> 09:35.493
But she can't retaliate because..
- Because of the Six Companies.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.701
Blah-blah-blah.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.868
Either way, she's fucked.

09:38.951 --> 09:39.992
It makes sense.

09:40.075 --> 09:41.242
But I didn't ice out the old man

09:41.326 --> 09:43.409
just to wait around for someone else
to make the first fucking move.

09:44.034 --> 09:47.868
This is the move.
Get me?

09:48.534 --> 09:49.951
When did you get so smart?

09:52.326 --> 09:53.493
I don't like to show-off.

09:53.576 --> 09:55.409
Well, we both know that's not true.

09:59.701 --> 10:03.326
Okay, we'll try this.
See how she reacts.

10:03.910 --> 10:06.117
But I'm not gonna keep us
in a stalemate forever.

10:11.451 --> 10:13.034
I underestimated him.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.534
You think this was Ah Sahm?

10:19.326 --> 10:21.992
Father Jun wouldn't authorize
a direct attack right now.

10:22.075 --> 10:24.117
They hit the Fung Hai
when they were at their weakest.

10:25.159 --> 10:26.534
This was strategic

10:27.493 --> 10:28.868
but it was also personal.

10:31.784 --> 10:35.826
He's provoking me,
daring me to break the treaty.

10:37.451 --> 10:39.743
I didn't think they'd move
so quickly after Zing.

10:41.618 --> 10:43.743
Because you weren't looking
at the bigger picture.

10:47.367 --> 10:48.701
So what do we do?

10:51.659 --> 10:52.951
There are other avenues.

10:54.701 --> 10:56.534
People who aren't
the least bit concerned

10:56.618 --> 10:58.034
about our little treaties.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.159
The bigger picture.

11:03.201 --> 11:04.284
Exactly.

11:36.242 --> 11:37.451
What's this?

11:37.951 --> 11:39.159
A celebration.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.576
We took out the Fung Hai
and fucked the Long Zii hard

11:44.659 --> 11:46.159
without breaking the treaty.

11:47.868 --> 11:50.992
And how many of your brothers
did you lose in the process?

11:55.910 --> 11:57.534
At least I did something.

11:58.618 --> 12:00.242
You're right, you did.

12:00.701 --> 12:02.826
And I'm sure
it was a hell of a scrap.

12:03.910 --> 12:06.409
But you've been in-charge
for, what, two days?

12:06.576 --> 12:08.075
And you're already waging war.

12:08.159 --> 12:10.618
The Fung Hai needed to go.
- Of course, they did.

12:10.826 --> 12:13.034
But maybe
there was a smarter way to do it

12:13.117 --> 12:15.117
one that wouldn't have cost you
good men.

12:16.493 --> 12:18.159
You've always been too impulsive.

12:18.451 --> 12:20.117
I tried to teach you patience.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.576
Maybe that's something
that can't be taught.

12:25.992 --> 12:28.284
Maybe that's something
you have to learn the hard way.

12:47.242 --> 12:48.242
All right.

12:48.326 --> 12:51.367
I don't need to tell you boys
what we're up against here.

12:51.701 --> 12:54.951
Every second that goes by
without that Chinaman in handcuffs

12:55.284 --> 12:58.075
only increases the chances
that we'll never see him again.

12:58.159 --> 12:59.367
And if that happens

13:00.034 --> 13:01.075
God help us.

13:01.367 --> 13:04.826
Chinatown is closed.
Effective immediately.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.659
I want every filthy,
god-forsaken corner in that shithole

13:08.784 --> 13:12.951
torn to shreds
until this Jacob is found.

13:13.451 --> 13:14.992
Someone gets in your way,
get him out.

13:15.201 --> 13:16.242
Someone doesn't wanna open the door

13:16.326 --> 13:17.951
kick it in.. - Buckley pulled in
every cop in the city.

13:18.534 --> 13:19.826
Should be a hell of a show.

13:21.868 --> 13:24.576
Christ, Lee.
You even up for this?

13:24.826 --> 13:25.784
Up for what?

13:26.117 --> 13:28.701
I reckon when push comes to shove

13:28.784 --> 13:31.034
you'll just pin it
on the first Chinaman you find.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.075
Right, Sergeant?
- All right.

13:33.409 --> 13:35.159
Get it done, get it done fast.

13:35.534 --> 13:36.493
Godspeed.

13:39.159 --> 13:41.701
Lee. Hey.

13:43.242 --> 13:45.826
I thought we were past this shit.
- You planted that watch.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.326
Yeah, you planted it
and you made me believe.

13:49.409 --> 13:51.242
You made me a part of your lie.

13:52.618 --> 13:53.701
What are you talking about?

13:54.367 --> 13:55.868
I spoke to Timmons' widow.

13:58.034 --> 14:00.534
You had a problem with the Fung Hai,
so you framed him.

14:04.326 --> 14:05.910
Keep your fucking voice low.

14:07.493 --> 14:09.701
What, are you telling me
he didn't deserve to go down?

14:10.701 --> 14:11.868
For God's sake, Bill.

14:12.326 --> 14:14.951
We lost men.
McLeod, Donnelly, Gallahue.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.242
You think I don't know that?

14:16.868 --> 14:18.868
They died in the line of duty.

14:20.117 --> 14:21.701
You say that
like you almost believe it.

14:21.784 --> 14:23.743
Oh, you sanctimonious, little prick!

14:25.242 --> 14:26.451
I don't know who it was that told you

14:26.534 --> 14:27.743
that the world
was black and white, Lee.

14:27.826 --> 14:30.117
But, believe me, they didn't do you
any fucking favors!

14:30.201 --> 14:32.826
At least I know
where to draw the line. - Yeah?

14:33.534 --> 14:36.451
And which side of that line
does killing your own kin fall on?

14:39.201 --> 14:41.992
Fuck! You are picking up
some bad habits, Lee

14:42.075 --> 14:45.034
and throwing punches at me
is top of the fucking list!

14:47.618 --> 14:48.493
Fucking..

14:51.910 --> 14:53.951
That's enough, goddamn it!

14:55.826 --> 14:58.701
What the hell is going on here?
- He's lost his fucking mind!

15:06.201 --> 15:08.201
Georgie, good morning.
- Mr. Leary.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.618
Morning, William.
How's the family?

15:12.784 --> 15:13.743
Hungry.

15:14.951 --> 15:16.992
I'm sorry to hear that.
Truly.

15:23.117 --> 15:26.159
It's not nearly enough, I know,
but maybe it'll help.

15:26.242 --> 15:27.659
I don't want a fucking handout.

15:28.367 --> 15:30.201
I want a job, like you promised.

15:31.868 --> 15:33.576
What the fuck do you think
I'm doing out there, huh?

15:34.201 --> 15:35.201
Day in and day out?

15:35.493 --> 15:38.743
I'm fighting for you.
I'm fighting for all these men.

15:39.951 --> 15:41.367
Change doesn't come overnight.

15:41.743 --> 15:43.868
Aye.
So you say.

15:44.034 --> 15:45.451
And so you've been saying.

15:46.034 --> 15:47.534
But we're all still here

15:48.034 --> 15:51.284
watching the goddamn chinks
ride past us every day

15:51.367 --> 15:52.868
on the way to our jobs.

15:53.284 --> 15:55.868
I pay my dues, we all do

15:56.409 --> 15:58.117
on what little we make.

15:58.284 --> 16:00.826
And I'm tired of fucking waiting.
- He's right!

16:02.409 --> 16:03.451
We need work!

16:06.493 --> 16:09.075
Settle down, all of you!

16:10.992 --> 16:12.534
You all heard the Mayor's speech.

16:13.534 --> 16:16.784
He's taken our side,
gonna force the coolies out.

16:17.284 --> 16:19.117
Any day now, you'll be back to work.

16:19.826 --> 16:22.117
And who do you think
put the fucking screws to him?

16:22.618 --> 16:24.367
It was my boot on their fucking neck.

16:24.451 --> 16:25.576
I delivered the message

16:25.659 --> 16:28.034
that you take our jobs
at your own fucking peril.

16:32.409 --> 16:35.868
If you think you can do better,
be my fucking guest.

16:37.826 --> 16:39.201
Maybe you're right

16:39.618 --> 16:41.159
but that's just words right now.

16:41.576 --> 16:44.784
And a politician's promises
won't put bread on my family's table.

17:00.910 --> 17:01.868
Here.

17:03.117 --> 17:05.409
What happened?
Who the fuck did this to you?

17:07.284 --> 17:08.910
Blake.
- The Mayor?

17:11.409 --> 17:12.409
He's dead.

17:12.951 --> 17:13.910
What?

17:14.618 --> 17:16.576
He attacked my sister. I..

17:16.992 --> 17:18.242
Oh, he was insane.

17:18.326 --> 17:21.784
I-I tried to stop him,
but he was too strong.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.784
Oh, my God, he's dead.

17:28.326 --> 17:29.284
It's okay.

17:29.659 --> 17:31.576
It's okay. It's okay.

17:33.075 --> 17:34.117
It's okay.

17:35.493 --> 17:37.910
Just..
Just breathe slow and easy.

17:40.409 --> 17:41.367
Now

17:42.034 --> 17:43.242
are you saying
it was you that killed him?

17:43.326 --> 17:44.534
It was Jacob.

17:45.659 --> 17:46.910
The-The..
Our valet.

17:47.242 --> 17:49.159
The Chinaman?
- She didn't want me to say anything

17:49.242 --> 17:51.284
but I couldn't let them
arrest her for it.

17:52.493 --> 17:53.784
She hates me now.

17:54.743 --> 17:55.701
The Mayor is dead.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.409
Someone's gonna swing for it.
You did the right thing.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.618
If Blake's gone,
who the fuck is in-charge?

18:07.075 --> 18:09.409
Raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.451
I, Walter Franklin Buckley..

18:12.534 --> 18:14.992
I, Walter Franklin Buckley..

18:15.326 --> 18:17.034
Do solemnly swear..

18:17.242 --> 18:18.951
Do solemnly swear..

18:20.075 --> 18:22.075
That I will support and defend

18:22.159 --> 18:24.618
the Constitution
of the United States..

18:25.201 --> 18:26.868
That I will support and defend

18:26.951 --> 18:29.326
the Constitution
of the United States..

18:30.701 --> 18:33.784
And the Constitution
of the State of California..

18:34.284 --> 18:36.951
And the Constitution
of the State of California..

18:38.659 --> 18:41.659
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic..

18:43.201 --> 18:47.075
Against all enemies,
foreign and domestic..

18:53.367 --> 18:55.618
That I will bear
true faith and allegiance

18:55.701 --> 18:57.868
to the Constitution
of the United States

18:57.951 --> 18:59.576
and the State of California..

18:59.868 --> 19:02.159
And that I will bear
true faith and allegiance

19:02.242 --> 19:04.201
to the Constitution
of the United States

19:04.284 --> 19:05.784
and the State of California..

19:08.159 --> 19:10.493
That I take this obligation freely

19:10.576 --> 19:14.451
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..

19:15.284 --> 19:17.493
That I take this obligation freely

19:17.618 --> 19:20.659
without any mental reservation
or purpose of evasion..

19:21.159 --> 19:23.117
And that I will well and faithfully

19:23.201 --> 19:26.659
discharge the duties
upon which I am about to enter..

19:28.784 --> 19:30.701
And that I will well and faithfully

19:30.784 --> 19:33.618
discharge the duties
upon which I am about to enter..

19:36.159 --> 19:37.701
And during such time

19:37.784 --> 19:40.951
as I hold the office
of the Mayor of San Francisco.

19:41.367 --> 19:42.910
And during such time

19:42.951 --> 19:46.618
as I hold the office
of the Mayor of San Francisco.

19:47.117 --> 19:50.659
Congratulations, Mr. Mayor.
The city is yours.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.159
Have you seen this man?

20:04.159 --> 20:06.576
Have you seen him?
This man, have you seen him?

20:15.034 --> 20:16.201
No!

20:20.576 --> 20:21.659
Come with me.

20:30.201 --> 20:32.326
Down!
Down with the chinks!

21:34.117 --> 21:35.242
You've seen this?

21:35.493 --> 21:39.284
If it's any consolation, it bears
almost no resemblance to you.

21:39.367 --> 21:41.576
I don't give a damn
about the quality of the rendering.

21:41.659 --> 21:42.701
Where are we in the search?

21:42.784 --> 21:44.701
We're looking for a Chinaman
in Chinatown.

21:44.784 --> 21:46.493
Could be a while.
- I don't have "a while."

21:46.576 --> 21:48.701
And neither do you, if you hope
to remain Chief of Police

21:48.784 --> 21:50.868
during my tenure.
- Sir, if you want a Chinaman

21:50.951 --> 21:53.367
I can get you one this morning,
but not the Chinaman

21:53.451 --> 21:54.826
not the one who murdered the Mayor.

21:55.034 --> 21:57.159
I can't just yank him out of a hat.

21:57.242 --> 22:00.451
Put a curfew in place.
And road blocks.

22:00.534 --> 22:03.618
No one comes or goes from Chinatown
without talking to a cop.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.201
I take it you'll approve
the extra hours for the men.

22:08.284 --> 22:10.326
I want the entire force
on the streets

22:10.409 --> 22:11.784
I don't care what it costs.

22:12.284 --> 22:15.075
Nobody sleeps until we have our man.

22:26.576 --> 22:29.034
Mr. Mayor.
Just the man I was looking for.

22:29.117 --> 22:30.576
Acting Mayor.

22:30.826 --> 22:33.576
Sorry to hear about Blake,
God rest his soul.

22:34.284 --> 22:35.826
He may have been
a twisted son of a bitch

22:35.910 --> 22:37.367
but he was a friend
of the working-man.

22:37.451 --> 22:39.618
Is there something
I can do for you, Mr. Leary?

22:39.701 --> 22:40.951
I'm in a bit of a rush.

22:41.367 --> 22:42.951
It's okay, I think I can keep up.

22:43.618 --> 22:44.951
These are dark times.

22:45.951 --> 22:47.534
First, they attack a cop
in his own home

22:47.618 --> 22:49.034
and now
they've assassinated the Mayor.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.493
They're straying from their pen
more and more.

22:52.242 --> 22:54.117
Some might get the idea
that our local government

22:54.201 --> 22:56.034
has lost all control
of the Chinese situation.

22:56.117 --> 22:57.576
If there's a point
you're trying to make..

22:57.659 --> 22:59.826
You don't have nearly enough men
to find the chink who did this.

22:59.910 --> 23:03.117
I have one of the most highly-trained
police forces in the entire country.

23:03.201 --> 23:05.576
That may be, but you're still
outmanned 100 to 1.

23:06.159 --> 23:07.618
I can tip the odds in your favor.

23:07.743 --> 23:09.367
And yours, presumably.

23:10.701 --> 23:12.659
The important thing
is to see justice served.

23:12.826 --> 23:13.784
Publicly.

23:13.951 --> 23:15.534
Especially for a brand-new Mayor.

23:16.201 --> 23:17.618
Show them he's up to the job.

23:17.701 --> 23:19.117
Demonstrate his will and whatnot.

23:19.201 --> 23:21.951
And how is it
you propose to help, exactly?

23:22.284 --> 23:24.534
Deputize one working-man
for every cop you've got looking

23:24.618 --> 23:25.701
until the search is over.

23:26.201 --> 23:27.409
You'll double your reach.

23:27.618 --> 23:29.242
I'll get you
the sharpest fellas we got.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.826
$3 a day ought to do it.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.951
Even if that was
a reasonable suggestion

23:34.034 --> 23:35.075
which we both know it isn't

23:35.159 --> 23:37.451
the city's budget won't accommodate
anything close to that.

23:37.534 --> 23:38.493
$2, then.

23:38.659 --> 23:40.784
A small price to pay
to keep these men occupied

23:40.868 --> 23:42.284
tensions being as high as they are.

23:43.784 --> 23:45.201
We wouldn't want to see vigilantes

23:45.284 --> 23:46.868
roaming the streets
on your watch now, would we?

23:47.493 --> 23:49.409
I mean, how would that look?

23:50.326 --> 23:52.951
You weren't able to intimidate me
when I was Deputy Mayor.

23:53.034 --> 23:55.409
What makes you think
you're gonna intimidate me now?

23:57.034 --> 23:58.409
There's more to lose, I guess.

24:00.534 --> 24:02.493
Before he went tits up,
Blake made a speech

24:02.576 --> 24:04.451
promising the working-men
would be taken care of.

24:05.034 --> 24:06.326
It would be a big fucking mistake

24:06.409 --> 24:08.534
for the man who succeeds him
to forget that promise.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.618
Mayor Blake never gave a speech
I didn't put in his mouth.

24:14.743 --> 24:18.701
It could be I will have use
for your crude tactics down the road.

24:18.826 --> 24:21.618
Until then, you and the working-men
will have to wait in line.

24:22.242 --> 24:24.659
I have more urgent matters
to deal with.

24:39.159 --> 24:42.534
San Francisco Police Department!
Everybody stay where you are!

24:42.618 --> 24:44.701
Easy there, big fella.
We're not here for a fight.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.409
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are looking for this man.

24:48.659 --> 24:50.075
The sooner you help us find him

24:50.159 --> 24:51.743
the sooner
we can get out of your hair.

24:51.826 --> 24:54.576
Harrison, start upstairs.
Search every room.

24:56.659 --> 24:59.534
Ah Toy.
- This man not here.

24:59.826 --> 25:01.701
Then you've got
nothing to worry about.

25:02.284 --> 25:04.743
Too many cops not good for business.

25:05.034 --> 25:06.910
Well, I've got more bad news for you.

25:08.117 --> 25:10.326
It's curfew,
means everyone's shut down

25:10.868 --> 25:13.159
until we find our man.
Including you.

25:26.618 --> 25:28.117
Look who's back from the dead.

25:29.367 --> 25:30.326
Remember me?

25:32.075 --> 25:34.451
Hard to say, you all
kind of look the same to me.

25:35.784 --> 25:37.534
Well, it's a wonder
you're here to crack wise

25:37.618 --> 25:38.951
after that beating you took.

25:39.618 --> 25:40.618
You saw that?

25:41.201 --> 25:42.367
And stopped it, too.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.493
See, that pause there
is where you thank me

25:45.576 --> 25:46.659
for saving your life.

25:48.992 --> 25:50.784
That's a lot of cops for one man.

25:51.159 --> 25:52.784
Well, a Chinaman killed the Mayor.

25:53.409 --> 25:55.201
We take that sort of thing
personally.

25:56.701 --> 25:58.284
Mayor Blake?
- That's right.

25:58.409 --> 26:00.951
Caved his head in with a fire poker
and then went underground.

26:01.075 --> 26:02.493
No one's seen him since.

26:02.826 --> 26:05.409
I don't have to tell you this doesn't
bode well for your people.

26:06.576 --> 26:09.242
The sooner we catch this guy,
the better for all concerned.

26:10.326 --> 26:13.159
Maybe you know him?
Name's Jacob.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.409
We don't all know each other.

26:19.493 --> 26:20.451
Well, maybe.

26:21.242 --> 26:23.242
But he was Mrs. Blake's manservant.

26:23.826 --> 26:24.992
I know you know her.

26:28.743 --> 26:30.910
Barely.
- Barely?

26:32.201 --> 26:34.576
Well, in the meantime,
no one gets in or out of Chinatown

26:34.659 --> 26:35.826
until we find our man.

26:35.910 --> 26:38.659
And my men will not stop
tearing this place apart.

26:39.117 --> 26:41.493
So, if you know anything..
- I don't.

26:41.951 --> 26:43.201
Would you tell me if you did?

26:45.534 --> 26:46.493
Nah.

26:46.743 --> 26:47.701
Well, then

26:48.701 --> 26:49.659
fuck off.

26:53.367 --> 26:55.451
And tell your friends
to stay off the streets.

26:55.618 --> 26:57.743
Today would be the wrong fucking day,
do you hear me?

27:18.618 --> 27:20.534
Evening, Mr. Mayor.
Come to check up on us?

27:20.618 --> 27:21.951
Something like that.

27:22.951 --> 27:24.534
Any action?
- None to speak of.

27:24.618 --> 27:25.659
But we'll get him, sir.

27:26.034 --> 27:27.117
Let him through!

27:27.242 --> 27:28.409
All right.
Yes, sir.

27:30.826 --> 27:31.784
Move along.

28:04.910 --> 28:06.868
It's been a while, Mr. Buckley.

28:07.117 --> 28:09.159
I was beginning to think
you'd forgotten me.

28:09.242 --> 28:11.117
I've been busy.
- So I hear.

28:12.493 --> 28:14.868
Congratulations on your promotion.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.784
It's funny.
When I came to San Francisco

28:20.284 --> 28:23.159
I never imagined I'd be granted
an audience with the Mayor.

28:23.242 --> 28:25.451
Well, let's see if we can make it
worth your while.

28:26.201 --> 28:28.951
I need to find this murderer, Jacob,
yesterday.

28:29.034 --> 28:30.284
That won't be easy.

28:30.659 --> 28:34.075
Chinatown may not be long or wide,
but it's very deep.

28:34.159 --> 28:37.451
True. But anything's possible
with the proper motivation.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.493
If you don't help me
locate this criminal

28:40.576 --> 28:42.743
it'll mean the end
of your opium supply

28:42.910 --> 28:44.951
and the beginning of a new era
in Chinatown

28:45.034 --> 28:48.367
one in which the Long Zii
are no longer immune to prosecution.

28:50.743 --> 28:52.534
So, not the carrot, but the stick.

28:52.618 --> 28:54.618
I cannot stress
how not in the mood I am

28:54.701 --> 28:55.784
for repartee.

28:59.242 --> 29:00.826
I can find your Jacob.

29:01.534 --> 29:02.826
But I'll want something in return.

29:02.910 --> 29:06.075
I already told you my terms.
- And now I'm telling you mine.

29:07.493 --> 29:09.201
It's simple, really.

29:10.201 --> 29:12.784
I want my enemies to be your enemies.

29:13.201 --> 29:14.826
And when the time comes

29:14.992 --> 29:18.117
your cops will help me
crush the Hop Wei.

29:19.784 --> 29:20.868
Do we have a deal?

29:25.868 --> 29:27.034
Find the coolie.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.784
It's me.
Nellie.

29:47.701 --> 29:48.659
Nellie?

29:53.701 --> 29:54.826
Come in.
Quick.

29:58.576 --> 30:00.576
I heard about the curfew,
I was worried.

30:01.201 --> 30:02.868
Oh, it wasn't easy
getting into Chinatown.

30:02.951 --> 30:04.117
The police were everywhere.

30:05.201 --> 30:06.534
Have they given you any trouble?

30:07.117 --> 30:08.701
They close business.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.284
But..
But I'm okay.

30:12.117 --> 30:13.075
Good.

30:13.493 --> 30:15.743
You must think me ridiculous
checking up on you.

30:16.743 --> 30:19.910
No.
It's very kind.

30:21.493 --> 30:23.743
I'm gonna head back out
to the vineyard

30:23.826 --> 30:26.534
I thought maybe you might
wanna come with me.

30:27.868 --> 30:28.951
Now?
- Yeah.

30:30.034 --> 30:31.576
With things in Chinatown how they are

30:31.659 --> 30:33.743
I thought it might be good
to get away for a few days.

30:34.493 --> 30:36.367
And, well, to be honest

30:36.451 --> 30:38.159
it would be nice
to spend some time together.

30:45.784 --> 30:46.826
Officer.

30:50.576 --> 30:51.951
Can I help you?

30:53.618 --> 30:55.117
Is there anyone else in here tonight?

30:56.201 --> 30:57.951
No.
Just us.

31:00.618 --> 31:02.159
Ma'am, you need to leave now.

31:03.367 --> 31:04.493
Excuse me?

31:05.159 --> 31:06.618
There's a curfew in effect.

31:06.701 --> 31:07.784
It's okay.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.159
Sergeant O'Hara already come.

31:12.534 --> 31:15.201
He sent us back.
Surprise inspection.

31:15.284 --> 31:16.951
I don't care who sent you.

31:17.367 --> 31:19.743
You can't just barge in here
without a proper..

31:20.284 --> 31:21.242
Nellie!

31:56.868 --> 31:58.784
Get back here, you whore!

32:11.284 --> 32:12.451
Stay down, bitch.

32:35.743 --> 32:36.868
Get it over with.

33:06.868 --> 33:07.826
No!

33:08.826 --> 33:09.784
No!

33:15.201 --> 33:16.159
No.

34:19.534 --> 34:20.618
Ah Toy.

34:29.409 --> 34:30.576
You must go.

34:31.201 --> 34:33.117
I'm not leaving you here like this.

34:33.576 --> 34:34.951
You need medical attention.

34:35.075 --> 34:36.534
Not safe for you here.

34:36.618 --> 34:37.868
Don't be ridiculous.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.326
We need to get you to a doctor.
- I said, go!

34:44.910 --> 34:46.284
You don't know me.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.493
And you don't belong here.

34:50.326 --> 34:52.159
No place for a white woman.

34:52.826 --> 34:54.034
Now, go!

35:33.159 --> 35:35.159
I asked you a question, slant.

35:36.075 --> 35:37.201
What's your fucking name?

35:37.284 --> 35:39.409
It's Wang Chao.
And he's not your man.

35:39.868 --> 35:40.951
You shouldn't be out here tonight.

35:41.034 --> 35:43.659
It's dangerous.
- Dangerous for everyone.

35:43.910 --> 35:45.659
I told you, he's not your man.

35:45.743 --> 35:48.159
Now get on with you,
or I'll feed you that fucking stick!

35:54.743 --> 35:56.326
You save that cop's life.

35:56.910 --> 35:58.826
And here I thought
I was saving yours.

35:59.618 --> 36:01.743
Forget about him. It's probably
his first time in Chinatown.

36:01.826 --> 36:04.117
Well, I see him again,
it will be his last time.

36:04.284 --> 36:06.117
Well, help me find this Jacob

36:06.451 --> 36:08.159
and we can get all these cops
out of here.

36:10.493 --> 36:13.326
I give you Zing and the Fung Hai.

36:14.034 --> 36:15.784
I help you with your swordsman.

36:15.868 --> 36:18.618
How many time I do your job
for you, Sergeant, hmm?

36:19.242 --> 36:21.242
Maybe you give me badge.

36:22.451 --> 36:23.659
I'll make it worth your while.

36:23.743 --> 36:26.826
Until next problem.
Then you shut me down again.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.868
I got you up and running
as fast as I could.

36:34.826 --> 36:36.201
I don't know this man.

36:36.701 --> 36:37.659
You sure?

36:37.951 --> 36:39.159
I know who I know.

36:40.701 --> 36:42.493
Well, if you hear anything,
you know where to find me.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.367
Of course.

36:44.659 --> 36:46.284
I am friend to police.

36:47.659 --> 36:48.618
Good night.

36:49.534 --> 36:50.826
And stay off the street.

36:56.242 --> 36:58.201
I am sorry
about shutting you down, Chao.

38:26.326 --> 38:27.326
Ah Toy?

38:33.117 --> 38:35.326
My God.
What happened to you?

38:37.659 --> 38:39.659
You try to kill me.

38:40.075 --> 38:41.784
What?
What are you talking about?

38:41.868 --> 38:42.951
I-I've been home all night.

38:49.701 --> 38:50.868
Dear God.

38:54.367 --> 38:55.326
Oh, no.

39:02.159 --> 39:03.451
I don't understand.

39:04.868 --> 39:06.201
Who are those men?

39:07.242 --> 39:08.618
Did they do this to you?

39:12.201 --> 39:13.576
You sign.

39:15.701 --> 39:16.659
Now.

39:18.117 --> 39:19.326
Sign what?

39:20.117 --> 39:23.201
You sign, or you die.

39:26.326 --> 39:27.618
Make choice.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.951
Surely you don't think
I had anything to do with this.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.201
I would never hurt you, Ah Toy.
Never.

39:36.784 --> 39:37.868
Lie again

39:38.659 --> 39:41.034
your children die in their beds.

39:46.493 --> 39:47.826
Finish sign.

39:48.284 --> 39:50.951
You go far away.

39:52.034 --> 39:53.534
I ever see you

39:55.117 --> 39:56.409
you dead man.

39:59.659 --> 40:00.784
I'm sorry.

40:59.451 --> 41:01.992
Who are you?
What the fuck do you want?

41:08.159 --> 41:09.117
Please.

41:10.534 --> 41:11.534
Help me.

41:14.743 --> 41:16.826
Please, help..

41:17.034 --> 41:18.034
Help me.
