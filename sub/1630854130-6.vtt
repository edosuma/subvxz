WEBVTT

00:04.743 --> 00:06.484
Run.

00:06.484 --> 00:07.964
Chicago PD!
Get your hands up!

00:07.964 --> 00:10.445
I run a safe place program.
I'm looking for Abby.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.360
You go looking for every kid
that comes through your doors?

00:12.360 --> 00:13.752
What the hell
is he doing in here?

00:13.752 --> 00:16.842
Sean has been playing me
this entire time.

00:16.842 --> 00:18.148
<i>I have more on Abby
than you're gonna get</i>

00:18.148 --> 00:19.976
in your DCFS file.
Just let me help.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.630
There are
over two dozen girls

00:21.630 --> 00:24.328
<i>that have gone through Safe
Place that no longer exist.</i>

00:24.328 --> 00:26.200
What are you actually saying?

00:26.200 --> 00:29.551
The chief's son is
trafficking underage girls.

00:31.901 --> 00:33.076
Ha.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.469
Jordan, you funny, man.

00:34.469 --> 00:36.819
For real.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.517
Vinessa's comin' up
from Texas next week,

00:39.517 --> 00:42.520
so you might as well just
stay with me until she leaves.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.262
You know she gon' wanna
yap your head off anyway.

00:45.262 --> 00:48.526
Right, we doin' family dinner,
she say.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.442
Girl & the Goat, right.

00:51.442 --> 00:54.358
Nah,
I just gotta see what I got,

00:54.358 --> 00:56.230
'cause I got four units
already done,

00:56.230 --> 00:58.145
but all that's Section 8.

00:58.145 --> 01:01.191
Yeah, boy, I got tenants moving
in the building next month,

01:01.191 --> 01:03.411
so you can crash with me until
we find something you like.

01:03.411 --> 01:05.891
We don't gotta rush it.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.589
Oh, Jordan, I gotta go.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.112
Just got here.
Love you, bro.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.201
You're late.

01:11.201 --> 01:12.898
Lower Wacker was flooded, Sarge.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.118
Yeah, rain'll do that.

01:15.118 --> 01:16.859
No disrespect,
but aren't I the one

01:16.859 --> 01:18.513
that's doing you the big
last-minute favor, Sarge?

01:18.513 --> 01:21.342
Yes, because your colleague,
Hailey Upton,

01:21.342 --> 01:23.257
unceremoniously canceled on me,

01:23.257 --> 01:25.389
and all of this
will be remembered.

01:25.389 --> 01:29.263
Mm, okay,
so who are we doin' today?

01:29.263 --> 01:33.397
We are doing a group
of patrol officers.

01:33.397 --> 01:36.183
The lecture series is supposed
to assist those inside

01:36.183 --> 01:38.794
who are very young
and also very wound up.

01:38.794 --> 01:41.275
The majority look like
tiny, little chickens

01:41.275 --> 01:43.364
who just discovered
what's on the menu,

01:43.364 --> 01:45.583
so don't go in there
all breezy.

01:45.583 --> 01:46.715
All right.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.066
But also,
don't go at 'em too hard.

01:50.066 --> 01:53.939
And don't middle ground it
and waste their time.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.159
Thank you for that, Sarge.
You just left me with a lot.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.395
Sanchez?
- Yes, sir?

02:14.395 --> 02:15.874
Get your wimpy ass up.

02:15.874 --> 02:17.180
Stand right there.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.834
There you go.
Everybody, get up.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.096
Get up.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.663
Get up!

02:21.663 --> 02:23.273
Get in a circle.
Fill in the gaps.

02:23.273 --> 02:24.405
Wherever you not at,
fill in the gaps.

02:24.405 --> 02:25.884
There you go.
Come on.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.932
Yeah, you feel that?

02:29.932 --> 02:31.629
Tension.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.457
Anxiety.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.198
I felt it as soon
as I walked in the room,

02:35.198 --> 02:38.984
but you feel it a lot more when
you stand like this, don't you?

02:38.984 --> 02:42.466
That's what half this job
is about--readin' that.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.902
Readin' the room
when you walk in.

02:43.902 --> 02:46.775
Readin' the car
when you pull it over.

02:46.775 --> 02:48.646
Feelin' violence
that just happened

02:48.646 --> 02:50.387
and violence
that's on the way.

02:50.387 --> 02:54.522
Feeling tension and anxiety
in the air.

02:54.522 --> 02:57.351
It's okay there's a little
tension around here right now,

02:57.351 --> 02:59.179
but you acknowledge that here.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.833
You feel it here,

03:01.833 --> 03:03.444
and then you leave it.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.360
Everybody, take a breath.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.368
Leave it.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.718
Don't take it out there
on the street with you,

03:16.718 --> 03:18.285
because it gonna be
hard as hell

03:18.285 --> 03:19.982
for you to read the air
when you need to.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.679
So instead,

03:21.679 --> 03:24.639
when you walk out of this room,

03:24.639 --> 03:26.771
take your empathy with you.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.514
Right?

03:30.514 --> 03:32.951
Empathy is what you take
out there on the streets.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.518
Empathy is where it starts,

03:34.518 --> 03:36.520
and empathy is what we gon'
be talkin' about today,

03:36.520 --> 03:37.782
whatever the hell that is.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.567
So let's get these desks back
in order.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.743
And if y'all got any questions,
we can start with that.

03:41.743 --> 03:42.874
Go ahead, Sanchez.

03:46.878 --> 03:49.272
Man, I can't believe
Platt roped you into that.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.361
Mm, sound like somebody

03:51.361 --> 03:53.320
who doesn't know Platt
that well yet.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.712
It was a good speech, though.

03:54.712 --> 03:57.324
Aw, appreciate that, dawg.
Appreciate that.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.716
I tried.
I tried.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.370
You know, I remember
being 21 years old,

04:00.370 --> 04:02.372
being scared out of my mind.

04:02.372 --> 04:03.852
I signed up
for the steady paychecks

04:03.852 --> 04:06.724
so I could feed myself
and to protect my siblings,

04:06.724 --> 04:09.814
and every old-ass FTO
said the same thing:

04:09.814 --> 04:11.251
"Show no fear.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.469
They ain't gon' respect you
unless you make 'em."

04:12.469 --> 04:13.688
I never really connected
to that.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.646
That wasn't really my style.

04:15.646 --> 04:18.388
<i>Units in the citywide
and units in 21st district,</i>

04:18.388 --> 04:20.608
<i>we're getting calls of an
armed carjacking in progress.</i>

04:20.608 --> 04:22.349
<i>26th and Canal.
Silver sedan.</i>

04:22.349 --> 04:23.741
- Mm-hmm, feel good about it?
- Yeah.

04:23.741 --> 04:24.655
Let's take it.

04:24.655 --> 04:26.483
50-21 Ocean.
50-21 David.

04:26.483 --> 04:29.051
Plainclothes officers responding.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.488
Clear right. Nothing.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.663
Clear left.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.015
There, there!
Pull up there!

04:37.015 --> 04:39.017
Help me!
Help me!

04:40.410 --> 04:42.934
Stop! Stop! Stop!

04:42.934 --> 04:44.588
No, please, my son!

04:44.588 --> 04:46.024
- Hey--
- He tried to fight them off!

04:46.024 --> 04:48.113
He's still in the car!
- Get her out the way!

04:48.113 --> 04:49.332
Stay with her!
I'm goin'!

04:49.332 --> 04:50.420
I got her, I got her.
Go, go, go!

04:50.420 --> 04:52.074
He's still in the car.
Oh, my God.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.082
50-21 David.
That call was bona fide.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.605
And my partner's
with the victim.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.391
Vehicle was last seen
goin' northbound on Canal.

05:04.391 --> 05:05.957
Second male victim
has been abducted.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.264
Offenders are armed.
We needs cars over here!

05:27.152 --> 05:28.197
Hey.

05:28.197 --> 05:29.590
Hang on.
I got you.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.287
I got you, I got you.
I'm police.

05:31.287 --> 05:33.289
50-21 David, on scene.

05:33.289 --> 05:34.638
Male victim
has sustained injuries

05:34.638 --> 05:36.248
to the leg, arms, and head.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.989
I need ambos
at 25th Place and Canal.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.687
Please advise all units
that the stolen vehicle

05:39.687 --> 05:40.862
is still in the wind.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.254
My mom?

05:42.254 --> 05:43.473
My mom, is she--
- She's safe.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.649
She's safe.
She safe.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.824
Let's worry about you
right now, okay?

05:46.824 --> 05:48.826
- Is she--
- Don't worry about her.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.698
She's okay.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.700
Did you see
the carjackers' faces?

05:52.700 --> 05:55.529
I had--I had to stop them.

05:58.706 --> 06:01.752
Listen, you did very good.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.058
Okay?

06:03.058 --> 06:04.451
She's not hurt.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.410
You saved your mama.
You did good, man.

06:07.410 --> 06:08.933
You did good.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.501
She's gonna be fine.

06:45.579 --> 06:48.973
It's okay.
Right this way.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.327
All right.
What do we got?

06:55.327 --> 06:57.025
Another violent
armed carjacking.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.506
- Yeah?
- Victims are a mother and son.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.811
Robin and Miles Reeves.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.510
Miles didn't make it.
Robin is still in shock.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.946
Was she able
to tell you what happened?

07:04.946 --> 07:07.688
Yeah, she said her son
was pumping gas in his BMW.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.298
She was walking
towards the passenger side

07:09.298 --> 07:10.473
after leaving the bathroom.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.519
The jackers ran up,
hit hard and fast.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.911
- Well, she get a look at 'em?
- Yeah.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.391
She said it was two of 'em,
both of 'em masked.

07:15.391 --> 07:16.914
One of 'em was armed.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.089
The one with the gun dragged
her out the passenger side.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.613
The other one
hit the driver side.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.831
- Hmm.
- How'd he end up here?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.920
Yeah, so many blocks away?

07:22.920 --> 07:25.575
The jacker yanked him
inside the car.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.490
Started drivin',
dragged him eight blocks.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.623
Had to be goin' at least 90
miles an hour by his injuries.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.276
Then they just tossed him out.

07:31.276 --> 07:34.671
All right, so let's get a
BOLO out on the stolen vehicle.

07:34.671 --> 07:36.107
Start chattin' up witnesses.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.283
Pull the surveillance video
from the gas station.

07:38.283 --> 07:39.589
Let's go.

07:48.816 --> 07:50.600
Anything about Sean?
- No.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.602
Well, nothing actionable.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.212
But he's been
with a young boy or girl

07:54.212 --> 07:56.040
every time I've seen him.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.781
That is his job.

07:57.781 --> 07:59.130
We should push him.

07:59.130 --> 08:02.438
No, listen.
We gotta be patient, okay?

08:02.438 --> 08:03.787
If there's something--
- There is.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.789
There's something there.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.138
We should loop in
the rest of the team,

08:07.138 --> 08:08.531
that way there's always
someone tracking him.

08:08.531 --> 08:09.837
We always have eyes.
- Hailey.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.317
If--or when--we have
actionable evidence,

08:12.317 --> 08:13.710
we will.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.974
Till then, I wanna keep this
between you and me.

08:20.500 --> 08:21.762
All right,
a 30-year-old dad of two

08:21.762 --> 08:23.633
just died
tryin' to save his mom.

08:23.633 --> 08:25.156
That's the case
we've got right now.

08:25.156 --> 08:26.288
Let's work it.

08:32.163 --> 08:33.382
Excuse me.

08:33.382 --> 08:34.992
I'm Officer Burgess.
This is Officer Ruzek.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.690
The carjacking that
just happened at pump four,

08:36.690 --> 08:37.952
did you see anything?
- Nope.

08:37.952 --> 08:39.736
Can't see pump four from here.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.174
All right.
Um, there was a woman.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.785
Her name was Robin.
She was one of the victims.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.134
She came in
to use the restroom.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.962
What do you remember?

08:47.962 --> 08:50.051
A lot of customers
come in here.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.662
Your name's Clarita?

08:53.576 --> 08:54.577
Right.

08:54.577 --> 08:55.839
Well, Clarita, while your help

08:55.839 --> 08:57.319
has been overwhelming,

08:57.319 --> 08:58.973
it's probably best you just
show us the lot footage

08:58.973 --> 09:01.149
and we can check
for ourselves, okay?

09:01.149 --> 09:03.847
None of these cameras work.
They're decoys.

09:03.847 --> 09:05.588
Owner's a cheap-ass.

09:05.588 --> 09:07.416
- Huh.
- This is Chicago.

09:07.416 --> 09:11.072
Cars get jacked around here
two, three times a day.

09:11.072 --> 09:12.726
I'm surprised
you guys showed up.

09:12.726 --> 09:13.944
You don't always.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.251
Yeah.
Well, we're here now.

09:17.861 --> 09:19.384
Look, I didn't see anything,

09:19.384 --> 09:23.780
but the guy across the street--
owns the liquor store--

09:23.780 --> 09:25.826
he's obsessed
with security cameras.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.309
All right.
Where are we?

09:31.309 --> 09:32.876
Still going
through old security footage

09:32.876 --> 09:34.225
from the past two months.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.227
Carjackings have tripled
in the Near South Side.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.229
That south loop area,
where the jackings took place,

09:38.229 --> 09:39.230
has been hit the hardest.

09:39.230 --> 09:40.884
- Same M.O.? Same men?
- Uh-huh.

09:40.884 --> 09:42.625
For that stretch,
that's what it looks like.

09:42.625 --> 09:44.627
Always two masked guys, armed,

09:44.627 --> 09:46.803
one of them always
in a black track jacket.

09:46.803 --> 09:47.891
Between the height,
weight, and masks,

09:47.891 --> 09:49.589
it's a pretty good match, Sarge.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.764
Clarita,
the gas station clerk,

09:50.764 --> 09:52.374
she may not be big
on customer service,

09:52.374 --> 09:53.418
but the girl can count.

09:53.418 --> 09:54.550
This pair has been doing two,

09:54.550 --> 09:55.595
three jackings a week.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.552
All right, all right.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.598
I got the latest footage.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.990
Okay, okay.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.387
Jesus,
they hit it hard and fast.

10:05.387 --> 10:06.954
They move like they know
what they're doing too.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.173
Never lookin' near a camera.

10:12.307 --> 10:13.308
Damn.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.746
All right,
the stolen cars fit

10:16.746 --> 10:18.487
any recent shootings?
- No, sir.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.749
None of them pops on any crime.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.185
They're not just doin' this
for joyrides.

10:21.185 --> 10:23.100
They're flipping 'em
for cash.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.233
Got something a block
from the carjacking.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.713
New traffic cam.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.411
This was minutes
before the carjacking.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.065
Jackers get out of this car.

10:31.065 --> 10:33.067
Car's registered
to an Andrew Chaffey.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.895
49 years old.
No priors, no backgrounds.

10:34.895 --> 10:36.505
He owns three homes,

10:36.505 --> 10:39.508
but this Nissan is registered
to his mansion in Lakeview.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.814
Never was reported stolen.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.772
All right, Kev, Adam,
you guys hit Lakeview.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.121
Rest of you,
split up the other two.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.949
Let's move.
- Good work.

10:55.916 --> 10:57.526
No, you swore to me!

10:57.526 --> 10:58.919
You know how this works!

11:00.703 --> 11:02.531
No, you promised him.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.185
You don't get to tell me
how things are.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.665
Go, go, go!

11:05.665 --> 11:07.188
- Hey!
- Hey!

11:09.843 --> 11:11.845
Hey! Chicago PD!

11:11.845 --> 11:13.107
I'm breaking left!
I'm breaking left!

11:13.107 --> 11:14.543
Copy.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.153
50-21 David,
in foot pursuit.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.720
<i>Headed west toward Halstead</i>

11:17.720 --> 11:19.722
<i>in between
Roscoe and Cornelia.</i>

11:19.722 --> 11:21.158
<i>White male,
slim build.</i>

11:21.158 --> 11:22.333
Black male,
black track jacket

11:22.333 --> 11:23.683
in connection
with the carjacking

11:23.683 --> 11:24.858
and the homicide.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.251
Hey!

11:28.905 --> 11:30.515
Son of a bitch.

11:30.515 --> 11:31.691
50-21 Ida.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.823
I got an Asian male,
about 5'4".

11:33.823 --> 11:36.043
Just hopped into a stolen
silver BMW, no plates,

11:36.043 --> 11:37.697
<i>heading north
towards Cornelia.</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:39.220
Uh-huh.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.092
You see that?
There's nowhere else to go.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.615
Okay?

11:43.615 --> 11:46.009
I need y'all to put your hands
up where I can see 'em.

11:47.532 --> 11:49.404
I'm puttin' my weapon away.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.492
Everybody's gonna be okay.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.102
Why the hell
you chasin' us, Cop?

11:52.102 --> 11:53.625
Because you're persons of
interest, and you're runnin'.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.931
Hey, Ruz,
I got two in the back.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.150
<i>Yeah, copy.
I'm heading back.</i>

11:56.150 --> 11:57.847
Hey, hey,
what the hell are you doin'?

11:57.847 --> 11:59.109
Don't go reachin'
for nothin', man!

11:59.109 --> 12:00.328
Why, so you can shoot us

12:00.328 --> 12:01.808
and say you was
fearin' for your life?

12:01.808 --> 12:02.983
Yeah, a'ight,
just keep your hands

12:02.983 --> 12:04.332
where I can see 'em, okay?

12:04.332 --> 12:06.160
- I didn't do anything, please.
- Okay.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.291
That don't matter now, Johnny.

12:07.291 --> 12:08.423
You see that gun?
You see it?

12:08.423 --> 12:09.903
- Listen.
- No, you don't understand.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.775
Okay, well, cooperate
and put your hands up.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.908
If you didn't do anything,
everything's gonna be okay.

12:14.908 --> 12:16.213
I'm gonna get a chance
to listen to both of you.

12:16.213 --> 12:17.562
Nah, man.
You put the gun down first.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.913
Put it down.
- I really didn't do anything.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.436
Okay, all right.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.047
Put your hands up then, Johnny.
It's gonna be okay.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.788
If you didn't do anything,
we gon' get a chance

12:25.788 --> 12:27.137
to work it all out.
- Nah, man!

12:27.137 --> 12:28.660
No, we ain't goin' to jail!
Right, Johnny?

12:28.660 --> 12:30.575
What? Jail?
I can't--

12:30.575 --> 12:31.881
I'm not going to jail!

12:31.881 --> 12:33.665
Johnny, don't listen to him.
Look at me.

12:33.665 --> 12:34.884
Matter of fact, you ain't
even supposed to chase us

12:34.884 --> 12:36.581
no more, Cop.
You made the mistake.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.496
Look at me.

12:38.496 --> 12:42.413
Hey! Hey!

12:45.634 --> 12:47.984
Oh.
Oh, God.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.725
Ruz.
Ruz, where you at?

12:49.725 --> 12:51.118
I need you!
I need an ambo!

12:51.118 --> 12:53.250
<i>Copy you.
Almost there.</i>

12:54.904 --> 12:56.079
Listen to me.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.864
It's okay.
You're okay.

12:57.864 --> 12:59.735
I was just--

12:59.735 --> 13:00.823
Shh.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.651
You're okay.
You're okay.

13:02.651 --> 13:05.132
I was just...

13:07.743 --> 13:09.092
50-21 Ida.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.225
Young male, white.
GSW to the stomach.

13:11.225 --> 13:13.270
I need an ambo right now.
Kev, you good?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.011
Yeah, I'm good. I'm good.
I just need that ambo!

13:15.011 --> 13:16.230
Where's the other offender?
Ambo's on its way.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.971
Don't worry about it.
Come on!

13:19.320 --> 13:20.408
You're okay.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.583
What happened?

13:21.583 --> 13:22.889
He lunged.
He lunged at me.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.847
I...
- I...

13:24.847 --> 13:26.980
I was just...

13:28.459 --> 13:30.984
Dispatch, I need an ETA
on that ambo right now.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.121
Hey, man.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.515
Kev?

13:41.951 --> 13:42.952
Wait.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.824
Wait, wait.
Stay here.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.349
Second one today, Sarge.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.482
Yeah, it's one of them days.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.832
All right.
Talk to me.

13:54.311 --> 13:55.704
We were approaching
three young males

13:55.704 --> 13:57.793
outside Andrew Chaffey's LKA.
- Okay.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.273
One of them had on
a black track jacket

13:59.273 --> 14:00.622
from the carjacking footage.

14:00.622 --> 14:02.537
The other one split
to the stolen vehicle.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.452
It's obviously the crew.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.019
I chased the third one
in there.

14:06.019 --> 14:08.760
Ruzek gets his ID out
of his pocket in the ambo,

14:08.760 --> 14:12.721
and it's Andrew Chaffey's son, Johnny.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.985
Listen,
kid's still hangin' on, okay?

14:15.985 --> 14:18.161
Just got to Med.
Adam's with him.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.296
Look, now I need you
to take a few breaths.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.775
- I'm fine.
- All right, Kev.

14:23.775 --> 14:25.168
I get that.

14:25.168 --> 14:28.128
Still, I need you
to take a few breaths

14:28.128 --> 14:30.695
before you talk to IRT, okay?

14:34.961 --> 14:36.919
Yeah, and then I was
in foot pursuit of both of 'em.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.965
At this point,
you were the only officer?

14:38.965 --> 14:40.444
At this point,
yes, sir.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.926
I drew my weapon
to clear this area.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.669
Once I corned both of 'em,
I seized my weapon,

14:47.669 --> 14:50.324
I gave 'em both verbal commands
to raise their hands

14:50.324 --> 14:51.368
at least three or four times.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.761
They both refused.

14:52.761 --> 14:55.590
And one of 'em,
the unidentified Black male,

14:55.590 --> 14:56.896
reached.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.854
I drew my weapon again.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.552
It was just his cell phone,
and the kid panicked.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.165
- The offender?
- Right.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.428
Right.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.603
Panicked offender.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.997
That's okay.
It's just the facts.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.259
Keep going.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.435
Yeah, well,
he was just a kid.

15:16.045 --> 15:19.440
I tried to de-escalate,
talk to both of 'em.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.964
I told them
that I would listen to 'em.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.489
The kid--the offender--
charged me.

15:26.664 --> 15:30.538
He got his hand on my arm,
the grip.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.756
He pushed the trigger.

15:31.756 --> 15:33.758
The offender
pushed the trigger?

15:33.758 --> 15:35.064
Yes, sir.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.892
I did my best to point
my weapon away from him,

15:36.892 --> 15:39.068
keep my finger off
of the trigger.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.635
He fired it.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.551
The only witness?

15:43.551 --> 15:45.074
Was the other individual
that fled--

15:45.074 --> 15:47.772
the other person of interest
in our carjacking.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.165
Okay.

15:49.165 --> 15:51.124
Now,
we're gonna need your clothes.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.168
We're gonna need
your service weapon

15:52.168 --> 15:53.865
to check for GSR as well.

15:53.865 --> 15:54.910
All right.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.965
All right.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.757
- Kev--
- Mm-hmm.

16:19.108 --> 16:22.198
A'ight, we got anything
on the two that got away?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.678
Not yet.
We don't have their IDs.

16:23.678 --> 16:24.984
We didn't catch 'em on cams.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.291
They were already scrappin'
when we got there.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.076
- Yeah.
- Right?

16:30.076 --> 16:32.556
The oldest of the three--
the one with the track jacket--

16:32.556 --> 16:34.863
he was roughing Johnny up already.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.430
Johnny was screamin' somethin'
about,

16:36.430 --> 16:37.909
"You promised.
You promised."

16:37.909 --> 16:39.868
I feel like they knew
each other pretty well.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.478
I'll run
his last known associates,

16:41.478 --> 16:42.697
A'ight, we got anything
on his logs

16:42.697 --> 16:43.915
from the phone carrier?

16:43.915 --> 16:45.004
Been runnin' 'em.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.266
Last calls and texts
were to his mom.

16:46.266 --> 16:47.354
Nothing pops yet.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.011
Officer Atwater,
do you have a minute?

17:01.237 --> 17:04.849
Johnny Chaffey just died
at Med.

17:04.849 --> 17:08.331
Chaffey was an honor student
at Latin Prep High School.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.290
He had no criminal record.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.510
The Chaffeys are
a very wealthy family.

17:13.510 --> 17:16.992
They are also
politically active.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.690
What are you saying?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.301
They've already
retained legal counsel

17:21.301 --> 17:22.954
and have called
a press conference.

17:24.608 --> 17:28.873
They're claiming
the shooting was unprompted.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.484
They're claiming
that their son's death

17:30.484 --> 17:32.921
was CPD incompetence.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.968
They're claiming
that it was murder.

17:46.674 --> 17:50.199
<i>He was a friend to many.</i>

17:53.985 --> 17:55.074
<i>Our son.</i>

17:57.815 --> 17:59.469
<i>But yesterday,</i>

17:59.469 --> 18:02.037
<i>Johnny was beaten
and gunned down by CPD</i>

18:02.037 --> 18:05.040
<i>like something he's not--
a criminal.</i>

18:05.040 --> 18:09.262
<i>The cop claims our son
tried to take his gun,</i>

18:09.262 --> 18:10.611
<i>shot himself,</i>

18:10.611 --> 18:12.656
<i>but not gunshot residue
was found on Johnny.</i>

18:12.656 --> 18:15.703
<i>The only GSR was found
on the officer.</i>

18:15.703 --> 18:18.053
<i>Johnny's prints
weren't on the gun.</i>

18:18.053 --> 18:19.881
<i>There's no footage.
There no body cam.</i>

18:19.881 --> 18:22.710
<i>There's no evidence.</i>

18:22.710 --> 18:24.929
<i>We asked you here,</i>

18:24.929 --> 18:27.889
<i>hoping you'll extend us
the same humanity</i>

18:27.889 --> 18:29.412
<i>and accountability
you show</i>

18:29.412 --> 18:33.155
<i>for our friends in the NAACP
and Black Lives Matter,</i>

18:33.155 --> 18:35.897
<i>so that this cop,
who happens to be Black,</i>

18:35.897 --> 18:37.551
<i>can be treated the same</i>

18:37.551 --> 18:38.943
<i>as white cops guilty...</i>
- Kev.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.075
<i>Of illegally shooting down
Black children.</i>

18:40.075 --> 18:41.250
You don't need
to be watching that.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.818
<i>He's a bad cop.
He's a bad cop.</i>

18:43.818 --> 18:45.863
We got work to do.
Come on.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.648
They know
I tested positive for GSR

18:47.648 --> 18:48.605
and they know that I'm Black?

18:48.605 --> 18:49.780
How do they even know that?

18:49.780 --> 18:51.782
Because someone
on our end is talkin'.

18:51.782 --> 18:53.393
Believe me,
I'm lookin' into it.

18:53.393 --> 18:56.047
Nah, Johnny got that black
eye from the other carjacker.

18:56.047 --> 18:57.919
The street was wet, so
the GSR would've never stuck.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.094
And I'm plainclothes, Sarge,

18:59.094 --> 19:00.443
so I don't wear a body cam.
- Kev,

19:00.443 --> 19:02.750
Kev, you did nothin' wrong.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.360
I know that.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.623
We all know that.
- Sarge.

19:06.623 --> 19:07.798
It doesn't matter
what you know.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.931
You and I both know that.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.063
It does not matter.
We have no witnesses.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.195
Yeah, but we got footage.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.545
The carjacker was filming, right?

19:15.545 --> 19:19.201
So all we gotta do is find him
and find his phone.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.334
Okay, we got two carjackers
out there

19:21.334 --> 19:24.554
who just brutally dragged a man
to his death.

19:24.554 --> 19:28.210
They also got video footage
of a police-involved shooting.

19:28.210 --> 19:31.692
So let's do our jobs
and find 'em.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.476
All right,
tell me we got somethin'.

19:33.476 --> 19:34.695
No IDs on them yet.

19:34.695 --> 19:36.131
We're running
Johnny's social media.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.089
He's got lots of friends,
lots of posts,

19:38.089 --> 19:40.048
but no gun flashing,
no gang disses,

19:40.048 --> 19:43.225
no joyride videos--
nothing.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.227
The Latin High School
has been really cooperative.

19:45.227 --> 19:47.490
They sent a list
of Johnny's friends,

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
teachers,
club members, mentors.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.278
We've been going through it,
but so far, nothin'.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.105
But...

19:54.105 --> 19:56.369
the carjacker filming
wasn't a kid.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.327
He was older.
Maybe he's leadin' 'em.

19:58.327 --> 20:00.373
Okay,
so let's expand our search.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.940
Run every offender
with a vehicular arrest.

20:02.940 --> 20:04.507
Then work backwards.
Let's go.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.771
I got the guy I chased--
the kid that fled in that BMW.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.991
Ran kids no longer in school.

20:09.991 --> 20:13.168
This is Cam Wong.
Expelled a year ago.

20:13.168 --> 20:14.909
He was in every grade school
class with Johnny.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.389
I'm thinkin' they're friends.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.260
Cam lives with his grandmother
in Irving Park.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.175
So bring him in.
Let's move.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.052
Can I help you?

20:28.052 --> 20:32.187
Ma'am, is there anyone
inside the house?

20:32.187 --> 20:33.188
- No, you can't go back there!
- Ma'am.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.711
I need you to step back!
Hey!

20:34.711 --> 20:35.886
Step back, ma'am.
- Hey.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.323
Hey.
- You're all right.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.499
Okay, ma'am, I need you
to take a deep breath, okay?

20:39.499 --> 20:40.543
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

20:43.677 --> 20:46.027
We got the BMW!
Let's go!

20:46.027 --> 20:47.289
He's going westbound
on Waveland!

20:47.289 --> 20:48.986
He's going westbound!
Go, go!

20:50.466 --> 20:54.253
50-21 David, in pursuit
of a stolen silver BMW sedan

20:54.253 --> 20:57.343
that's going westbound
on Waveland.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.520
50-21 David,
goin' north on Kimball.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.876
Whoa, this kid's driving
way too erratic.

21:11.618 --> 21:12.706
Son of a bitch.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.752
Whoa!

21:17.406 --> 21:18.755
Uh-uh.

21:18.755 --> 21:20.061
Nah, we blew it.
We're done. We're done.

21:20.061 --> 21:21.323
We gotta call this.
- Kev--

21:21.323 --> 21:22.759
That kid's been driving
way too dangerous.

21:22.759 --> 21:24.805
- We need him in custody.
- We gotta stop right now.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.936
- Bro, you need him in custody.
- No!

21:29.418 --> 21:31.725
Stop the car, Ruz.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.248
We're callin' it.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.903
50-21 David, we're terminatin'
the chase immediately.

21:35.903 --> 21:38.122
No cars needed.
We're terminatin' the chase.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.298
Kid, why you not slow--

21:50.396 --> 21:52.267
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.017
Uh, I don't know.
Kev made the right call.

22:03.017 --> 22:05.846
He called off the chase,
but this kid, he just--

22:05.846 --> 22:07.195
he just kept goin'.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.240
He's not responsive,
but he still has a pulse.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.807
All right.
And the grandma?

22:10.807 --> 22:12.418
Said she knew
Cam was up to something.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.115
Kept seeing different cars
in the driveway,

22:14.115 --> 22:15.377
but claims
that's all she knows.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.770
She says
she swears she doesn't know

22:16.770 --> 22:17.945
who he was working with.

22:17.945 --> 22:20.861
Nah, not with. For.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.819
They're kids.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.126
Somebody else has them
working for them,

22:25.126 --> 22:27.433
and whoever that is
is responsible for this.

22:29.696 --> 22:31.306
Lead carjacker
has to be someone

22:31.306 --> 22:32.960
who has access
to these kids, right?

22:32.960 --> 22:34.875
Through their neighborhood,
through school.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.878
Right, or maybe
somebody they met online.

22:37.878 --> 22:39.358
Officer Atwater.

22:41.447 --> 22:42.970
It was you.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.450
You killed our son.

22:44.450 --> 22:45.973
Our boy.

22:45.973 --> 22:50.194
You murdered him,
yet here you are at work.

22:50.194 --> 22:52.283
Just another day,
suffering nothing.

22:52.283 --> 22:54.677
- Kev, let's go upstairs.
- No, I'm good.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.418
How ya feel?

22:56.418 --> 22:58.638
You feel proud?

22:58.638 --> 22:59.987
You coward.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.336
You crooked coward.

23:01.336 --> 23:04.426
Sir,
I know you don't believe me,

23:04.426 --> 23:06.472
but I did my job.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.995
I'm sorry.

23:07.995 --> 23:09.300
I'm so sorry.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.955
Doing your job?

23:13.435 --> 23:14.784
You're sorry?

23:14.784 --> 23:16.569
I am.

23:16.569 --> 23:18.005
I'm sorry for your loss.

23:18.005 --> 23:20.747
Turn in your badge today,
or we'll destroy you.

23:20.747 --> 23:21.922
- Hey!
- I'll spend

23:21.922 --> 23:24.011
the rest of my life
destroying you!

23:24.011 --> 23:25.839
You! This department!
This whole damn city!

23:25.839 --> 23:27.580
What were
my son's last words?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.364
You won't be able
to walk in Chicago

23:29.364 --> 23:30.974
without fear
when we're done with you!

23:30.974 --> 23:32.454
Okay, that's enough.
Kevin, go upstairs.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.761
Please, please.
What were my son's last words?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.458
Kevin, go upstairs.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.851
- Please.
- Ma'am.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.026
- Please?
- Ma'am.

23:42.203 --> 23:44.945
Please.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.257
They shouldn't know
who he is.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.128
That goes
against every protocol

23:54.128 --> 23:55.259
that we have.
- Yeah?

23:55.259 --> 23:56.783
Well, there was a leak.
- Okay, IRT?

23:56.783 --> 23:59.220
No, PPO Sanchez.

24:00.700 --> 24:03.833
He was doing mandatory
rotation hours

24:03.833 --> 24:06.227
with Detective Nowak,

24:06.227 --> 24:09.273
and he teased the screenshot
of the report to the Chaffeys.

24:09.273 --> 24:10.927
They sent him money,
and he leaked it.

24:10.927 --> 24:13.190
Have you fired him yet?
Because I'd be happy to.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.975
He's gone.

24:16.672 --> 24:20.328
Officer Atwater,
I need to speak with you.

24:20.328 --> 24:22.765
If you would rather we talk,
just you and I--

24:22.765 --> 24:25.899
No, I'm happy
to talk right here.

24:27.161 --> 24:30.512
The Chaffeys,
they're not gonna stop coming,

24:30.512 --> 24:33.559
so the superintendent
and the mayor

24:33.559 --> 24:36.475
would like to avoid
the media firestorm

24:36.475 --> 24:39.652
the Chaffeys' money will bring
in courtroom drama.

24:39.652 --> 24:44.700
And given the lack of evidence
tying their son to this crime--

24:44.700 --> 24:47.007
Sir, just come out with it
if you're telling me

24:47.007 --> 24:49.618
that the CPD is goin'
leave me out here to dry.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.317
I offered them a solution,

24:53.317 --> 24:55.624
and a case
for sympathetic reflex

24:55.624 --> 24:57.365
is corroborated
by the evidence.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.672
It would also be corroborated
by COPA.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.282
Okay, sympathetic reflex.

25:01.282 --> 25:05.416
So you want me to say that
I accidentally shot the kid?

25:05.416 --> 25:07.767
That my body betrayed me?

25:07.767 --> 25:11.597
Sympathetic reflex can
be proven by science, right?

25:11.597 --> 25:15.339
It would allow CPD to back you.
You wouldn't lose your job.

25:15.339 --> 25:17.603
It's the best way
that I can protect you.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.219
No.

25:25.219 --> 25:27.351
I don't need protection.

25:27.351 --> 25:30.441
- Kevin, the Chaffeys--
- Trudy.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.402
I'm listenin' to everything
that you all are sayin',

25:34.402 --> 25:35.925
and I hear you.

25:35.925 --> 25:38.275
But what they're claiming
this shooting was--

25:38.275 --> 25:41.496
a bad cop killing
an unarmed kid--

25:41.496 --> 25:45.369
is not it, and it is
not sympathetic reflex.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.589
It's sad.

25:47.589 --> 25:49.156
And I don't want that
to be the truth

25:49.156 --> 25:54.117
just as much as anybody else,
but that is what happened.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.597
I...

25:55.597 --> 25:57.947
You got your answer.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.650
Am I benched yet?

26:05.999 --> 26:09.350
No.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.004
Well,
I gotta get back to work.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.664
How is it
that we don't have any leads

26:18.664 --> 26:20.056
off of Johnny's contacts?

26:20.056 --> 26:21.405
It's like he didn't even know
the carjackers.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.582
I know.
It's very strange, Kev.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.496
But there is nothin'.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.716
I hear you,
but there has to be.

26:27.716 --> 26:30.327
I ran all previous
aggravated carjackings.

26:30.327 --> 26:31.894
No one with priors was a match.

26:31.894 --> 26:35.202
Okay, okay,
so this guy's good at this.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.507
He uses kids.

26:36.507 --> 26:39.336
Kids are easy to manipulate,
easy to control.

26:39.336 --> 26:40.773
He uses people
who won't roll on him.

26:40.773 --> 26:43.514
But what's in it for them?
Where's the money?

26:43.514 --> 26:44.820
I mean,
kids would wanna get paid,

26:44.820 --> 26:47.040
or else why the hell
would they be doing this?

26:47.040 --> 26:49.390
There's nothing in Johnny's
bank account, nothing in Cam's.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.000
Both their Venmos are clean.

26:54.395 --> 26:55.788
When Jordan was a teenager,

26:55.788 --> 26:57.703
the only thing he wanted
in the world were sneakers.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.792
Gifts.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.054
Hell yeah.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.273
The lead carjacker's
paying them in gifts.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.667
Oscar Boyd.
Same guy I chased.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.277
Same guy that filmed us
in the alley.

27:07.277 --> 27:10.063
This man sent over $3,000 worth
of luxury goods

27:10.063 --> 27:11.630
to Cam Wong's address.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.675
Never been arrested for
aggravated vehicular hijacking,

27:13.675 --> 27:15.068
but his two cousins have.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.243
That's his M.O.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.462
- The chop shop?
- Oscar runs it.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.638
Huh.

27:23.293 --> 27:24.686
Go.
I got him.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.775
Hey, let me see your hands!

27:26.775 --> 27:28.385
Turn around!
- Clear!

27:28.385 --> 27:30.474
Turn around!

27:30.474 --> 27:32.259
Down on your knees!

27:34.870 --> 27:36.698
Chicago PD!

27:37.743 --> 27:39.527
Put your hands up!

27:39.527 --> 27:41.398
Chicago PD!
Let me see those hands!

27:41.398 --> 27:42.617
Let me see 'em!

27:42.617 --> 27:44.227
Chicago PD!

27:44.227 --> 27:45.794
Get your hands up!

27:45.794 --> 27:47.448
Turn around!
- Yo.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.455
Uh-uh.

27:54.455 --> 27:57.719
Fight me
so I can fold yo' ass up.

27:59.242 --> 28:00.722
It ain't here.

28:00.722 --> 28:04.117
That little movie you want,
it ain't here.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.514
Hey, you get the phone?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.081
No, Sarge.
He's clear.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.954
All right, let's find it.
Tear this place apart.

28:16.651 --> 28:19.610
Contributing
to the delinquency of minors,

28:19.610 --> 28:22.222
multiple aggravated
vehicular hijackings

28:22.222 --> 28:23.397
with a deadly weapon,

28:23.397 --> 28:24.746
assault with a deadly weapon.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.269
What am I missing, Kev?

28:26.269 --> 28:28.794
- Felony murder.
- That's right, felony murder.

28:30.317 --> 28:31.710
You've been real busy, Oscar.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.842
Are you done
listing my charges?

28:33.842 --> 28:35.844
Does that mean
it's my turn now?

28:35.844 --> 28:37.411
- For what?
- Oh.

28:37.411 --> 28:40.283
For me to say that
I waive my right to a lawyer.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.284
Mm.

28:41.284 --> 28:43.112
Don't need one.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.854
See, us three, we just
gon' talk like real men.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.073
Mm.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.162
'Cause I got leverage.

28:50.685 --> 28:52.731
You.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.212
You.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.692
You shot that white boy

28:57.692 --> 28:59.781
like he killed
a unarmed Black man.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.523
Whoo, finally one for us!

29:02.523 --> 29:04.873
My man.

29:09.312 --> 29:13.708
Or maybe it was something else.

29:15.014 --> 29:17.712
You probably want
some proof of that.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.195
You probably need it.

29:24.153 --> 29:28.157
What I need is for you two
to lessen the charges.

29:28.157 --> 29:29.550
No more than two years.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.986
That sounds about right.

29:30.986 --> 29:34.990
And I need protective custody.

29:34.990 --> 29:38.428
And I need money each week
on my books,

29:38.428 --> 29:39.908
and a mattress pad,

29:39.908 --> 29:42.128
and two ergonomic pillows.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.045
That'll do it.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.398
We tossed Oscar's place--

29:51.398 --> 29:54.357
every closet, cabinet, drawer,
pulled up the floors.

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
There's still no burner phone.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.187
The video's not in any
of his tech, not in the cloud.

29:58.187 --> 30:00.668
I pulled all the data
from his registered cell phone.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.191
It's clean,
of course.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.845
All right,
what about his vehicles?

30:03.845 --> 30:05.760
His last knowns?
- They're all clean.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.544
Wherever the phone is,
we don't have it.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.375
All right, let's get
ASA Chapman on the phone,

30:12.375 --> 30:14.203
see what kind of deal
we can get in writing.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.248
No.

30:16.684 --> 30:18.904
We're not makin' a deal.
- Kev.

30:20.862 --> 30:21.820
I mean, you gotta know.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.821
I mean, the Chaffeys,

30:22.821 --> 30:25.084
they got cash, lawyers.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.217
I mean, they will get this
to a courtroom

30:28.217 --> 30:29.566
in front of a jury.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.785
Let 'em.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.747
I won't lie.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.099
We'll find another way.

30:46.757 --> 30:48.150
I don't know
that this is gonna work.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.412
It'll definitely gonna work.
Trust me.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.327
It's not gonna work
if Oscar saw Torres.

30:51.327 --> 30:53.503
Torres was coverin' the back
when we breached.

30:53.503 --> 30:55.462
I'm sure Oscar
didn't see Torres.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.333
Look, I'm just worried
that if it doesn't work

30:57.333 --> 30:58.639
and it pisses Oscar off more,

30:58.639 --> 31:00.249
he's gonna be harder
to make a deal with, Kev.

31:00.249 --> 31:01.468
It doesn't matter,
because we're not making a deal

31:01.468 --> 31:02.948
with him anyway, Ruz.

31:05.776 --> 31:08.779
I appreciate you,
but I meant what I said.

31:08.779 --> 31:09.780
You ready?

31:09.780 --> 31:11.521
I'm ready.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.045
But I can't go in clean.

31:22.228 --> 31:23.969
Yo.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.274
Son of a bitch.

31:25.274 --> 31:26.406
You can't be
roughing people up.

31:26.406 --> 31:29.104
You know that, right? Huh?

31:29.104 --> 31:30.932
- Sleep it off.
- Okay.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.499
Yeah.

31:32.499 --> 31:35.284
You know
this ain't legal, right?

31:35.284 --> 31:37.156
I'm sober.
I'm sober now.

31:37.156 --> 31:38.113
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah!

31:38.113 --> 31:40.289
Uh-huh, yeah!

31:40.289 --> 31:41.334
You're gonna have to answer

31:41.334 --> 31:43.640
for not giving me
my phone call!

31:43.640 --> 31:45.512
Son of a bitch!

31:45.512 --> 31:48.645
Hey!
- They gone.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.788
All right, y'all.
Here we go.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.539
<i>They're screwing with me.
That's what they're doing.</i>

32:12.539 --> 32:15.194
<i>Yeah, you're not giving me
my phone call!</i>

32:16.499 --> 32:18.110
Ain't doin' what the law says!

32:18.110 --> 32:19.763
Stop screaming.

32:22.418 --> 32:24.594
They ain't gon' be back
for hours.

33:07.202 --> 33:08.943
<i>Come on, man.</i>

33:20.346 --> 33:22.652
What you in for, man?

33:24.089 --> 33:27.005
Okay, we're movin'.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.485
<i>Tried to boost
a Jeep TrackHawk on Mag Mile.</i>

33:29.485 --> 33:32.923
The woman in it had a Glock.

33:32.923 --> 33:35.665
Almost capped my ass.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.798
The police came,
arrested me,

33:37.798 --> 33:40.018
and let the lady
with the Glock 19 walk.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.629
What?

33:42.629 --> 33:45.110
Yeah, she had a CCL,
no records.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.981
<i>I had warrants.</i>

33:46.981 --> 33:48.287
Come on.

33:48.287 --> 33:49.723
He ain't gonna be able
to resist this.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.116
Come on.

33:51.116 --> 33:52.334
Come on, man.

33:55.163 --> 33:58.427
Mag Mile is way too hot.

33:58.427 --> 34:01.256
Yeah. Okay, bro.

34:01.256 --> 34:02.605
It's got them fancy rides,

34:02.605 --> 34:05.347
but it's got
them fancy cameras too.

34:05.347 --> 34:06.827
It's a green move.

34:06.827 --> 34:10.309
Yo, what--what the hell
do you know about it, bro?

34:14.182 --> 34:16.184
So when you get out of here?

34:16.184 --> 34:20.188
My girl's gonna bail me out
as soon as I get my phone call.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.278
Mm-hmm.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.243
Come on.

34:32.461 --> 34:34.246
<i>Bro, what you in for?</i>

34:37.727 --> 34:39.990
What you think?

34:39.990 --> 34:41.992
Except I actually get the car.

34:44.865 --> 34:47.824
You ever wanna learn
the real thing,

34:47.824 --> 34:49.261
find me when you get out.

34:49.261 --> 34:50.914
Yo.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.351
You jacked a car,

34:52.351 --> 34:55.528
and you think
you're getting out before me?

34:55.528 --> 34:58.487
I wasn't violent.
The lady was violent.

34:58.487 --> 35:02.535
I already got my call, kid.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.754
I got all the calls I need.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.235
But you--

35:09.672 --> 35:11.239
I can get that bitch
to come unlock the door,

35:11.239 --> 35:13.937
give me anything I want.

35:13.937 --> 35:16.462
My insurance.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.594
Matter of fact,
that's a free gain for you.

35:18.594 --> 35:21.815
Always get yourself
some insurance.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.861
Bro,
what are you talking about?

35:26.559 --> 35:28.300
- You watch the news?
- Yeah.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.258
You see the white boy
that got shot?

35:30.258 --> 35:31.781
Yeah, so what?

35:33.174 --> 35:35.568
I got a video of it,

35:35.568 --> 35:38.919
and the police are gonna
give me whatever I want

35:38.919 --> 35:40.921
for my movie.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.408
Yo,
police are gonna find that.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.237
I ain't stupid.

35:52.237 --> 35:55.109
I ain't keep it on me.

35:55.109 --> 35:56.806
My girl's got it.

35:58.634 --> 36:01.246
Who the hell
is his girlfriend?

36:01.246 --> 36:02.986
We got anything on the girl?

36:05.467 --> 36:07.600
Nothing on social.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.776
Okay.
What about phone records?

36:09.776 --> 36:11.386
Bunch of texts.
None of them stand out.

36:11.386 --> 36:12.909
None of them sound
like a girlfriend.

36:12.909 --> 36:15.347
A'ight, get PODs outside
his home and his chop shop.

36:15.347 --> 36:17.262
You run any vehicle
comin' or goin'.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.741
- I'm already on it.
- Uh-huh.

36:18.741 --> 36:20.743
Frequent callers?
Anything?

36:20.743 --> 36:21.962
They're all
a bunch of burners.

36:21.962 --> 36:22.876
It's gonna take time.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.443
We also got WhatsApp, Venmo.

36:24.443 --> 36:25.748
He could've met her
on a dating site.

36:25.748 --> 36:28.011
Or on his block.
I think I got her.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.277
All right,
plates are Charlie, George,

36:32.277 --> 36:33.713
one, four, three, six, seven.

36:33.713 --> 36:37.499
Charlie, George,
one, four, three, six, seven.

36:37.499 --> 36:39.849
Yep, Clarita Bolvine.

36:39.849 --> 36:41.155
Clarita?

36:41.155 --> 36:43.810
Yeah, lives in Humboldt Park.
No priors.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.465
I knew she was acting funny.

36:46.465 --> 36:47.857
This is the woman
from the gas station.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.120
Grab Torres.

36:50.120 --> 36:52.035
I'll get the warrant
while you're on your way.

36:52.035 --> 36:53.123
Copy that.

36:56.866 --> 36:58.955
Clarita Bolvine, put
your hands where I can see 'em.

36:58.955 --> 37:01.001
Put 'em up.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.568
You under arrest.
It's over.

37:02.568 --> 37:04.004
Don't act like you don't know
what the hell is goin' on.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.398
It's not what you think.
I was just his lookout.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.530
And I really--

37:08.530 --> 37:09.923
I didn't--
I didn't want--

37:09.923 --> 37:11.664
You didn't what?
Clarita, look at me.

37:11.664 --> 37:14.493
Oscar doesn't give a damn
if you go to jail.

37:14.493 --> 37:16.408
Did he give you his phone?

37:21.848 --> 37:23.806
<i>Come on, man.
Everybody just needs to relax.</i>

37:23.806 --> 37:25.417
We're gon' be fine.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.210
I mean, that's cut and dry.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.864
CPD will release it.

37:37.864 --> 37:40.301
I'm sure
we can isolate the footage.

37:40.301 --> 37:44.044
We'll be transparent,
I'm sure.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.963
Is that all?
Are we done?

37:52.270 --> 37:54.010
Yeah.

38:07.459 --> 38:09.896
No, no, no.
I don't need to see you.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.507
- I know that.
- Look, I saw the video.

38:12.507 --> 38:16.642
If you're here looking for an
apology, you'll never get one.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.557
That's not why I came.

38:18.557 --> 38:22.387
That video
didn't change a thing.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.781
You killed my son.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.783
Get the hell off my property.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.324
Why are you here?

38:47.368 --> 38:52.068
I'm not leavin' until I can
help fill in some gaps for you.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.549
May I do that, please?

38:58.379 --> 38:59.772
What do you mean?

39:03.428 --> 39:04.820
The man responsible

39:04.820 --> 39:06.648
for your son being involved
in all of this

39:06.648 --> 39:09.434
is Oscar Boyd.

39:09.434 --> 39:12.959
Oscar Boyd is goin' to prison
for the rest of his life.

39:14.395 --> 39:17.485
This man recruited a child
to help him steal cars.

39:17.485 --> 39:19.574
The child's name was Cam Wong.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.752
Your son's friend.

39:23.752 --> 39:26.755
And I think a lot of people
turned their backs on Cam

39:26.755 --> 39:29.845
after he got expelled--
everybody but your son.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.718
Oscar knew that
Cam was easily manipulated,

39:32.718 --> 39:34.676
knew that he needed cash,

39:34.676 --> 39:36.025
knew that he needed
to feel accepted,

39:36.025 --> 39:39.246
so he used that,
and he exploited it.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.424
Did he do that to Johnny too?

39:43.424 --> 39:45.121
Mm-mm.

39:45.121 --> 39:49.038
There is no evidence that
your son took any deals, no.

39:49.038 --> 39:51.258
But we do know
that Cam wanted out.

39:51.258 --> 39:55.480
Cam wanted to stop,
and Oscar wouldn't let him.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.482
So Cam told your son, Johnny.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.527
Oh, God.

39:59.527 --> 40:02.182
And Johnny just wanted
to help his friend.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.579
Ma'am.

40:09.798 --> 40:12.235
You raised a good man.

40:16.283 --> 40:20.418
Your son's last words were,

40:20.418 --> 40:22.332
"I was just."

40:24.030 --> 40:27.512
And I think
what he was tryin' to say was

40:27.512 --> 40:29.775
he was just...

40:29.775 --> 40:32.081
tryin' to help.
