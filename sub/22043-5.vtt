WEBVTT

00:02.401 --> 00:04.941
- [Gordon] I'm visiting
an inn in Massachusetts

00:04.941 --> 00:07.244
that's being run by a
dysfunctional couple.

00:07.244 --> 00:10.633
- I love you so much, but you
suck as a business partner.

00:10.633 --> 00:11.711
- [Gordon] He's lost...

00:11.711 --> 00:13.301
- I have no idea what I'm doing here.

00:13.301 --> 00:14.766
- [Gordon] And she's lost it.

00:14.766 --> 00:15.701
(sobs)

00:15.701 --> 00:17.710
- Just wanted to keep it together tonight.

00:17.710 --> 00:19.407
- And with the staff suffering as well...

00:19.407 --> 00:21.094
What's the worst thing
she's ever done to you?

00:21.094 --> 00:22.360
- Smacked me on the back of the head.

00:22.360 --> 00:24.633
- [Gordon] I'm not even sure
if I can get through to them.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.523
The whole operation is screwed.

00:26.523 --> 00:27.780
- What do you think we should do?

00:27.780 --> 00:28.613
- Close.

00:28.613 --> 00:30.363
- Have a nice night.

00:33.341 --> 00:36.008
(melodic music)

00:37.583 --> 00:39.869
- [Gordon] Nestled in the
heart of scenic New England

00:39.869 --> 00:42.235
lies the small industrial
town of Southbridge,

00:42.235 --> 00:43.402
Massachusetts.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.450
It's home to the Vienna
Inn and Restaurant.

00:47.450 --> 00:50.043
Husband and wife, Jonathan and Lisa Krach,

00:50.043 --> 00:51.715
have owned and operated the inn

00:51.715 --> 00:54.963
since buying the property
back in the year 2000.

00:54.963 --> 00:57.493
- Jonathan had this crazy idea

00:57.493 --> 01:01.883
of creating the Vienna
as an Austrian restaurant

01:01.883 --> 01:03.882
and bed-and-breakfast.

01:03.882 --> 01:06.725
- She said, "Have you been drinking?"

01:06.725 --> 01:09.262
I said, "No, not yet."

01:09.262 --> 01:12.403
- We try to transport
people and to give them

01:12.403 --> 01:14.445
that feeling of being in Vienna

01:14.445 --> 01:16.778
without having to fly there.

01:19.364 --> 01:22.035
- When people come in and they
stay here for the first time,

01:22.035 --> 01:24.659
they think that Jonathan and
Lisa are very gracious hosts.

01:24.659 --> 01:27.087
Charming, the perfect married couple.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.107
But if you dig a little bit deeper

01:29.107 --> 01:31.103
and you stay a little bit longer,

01:31.103 --> 01:33.146
you find out it's quite a different story.

01:33.146 --> 01:34.699
- Lisa is an emotional person.

01:34.699 --> 01:36.098
She does get upset often.

01:36.098 --> 01:38.202
She will just, you know, explode

01:38.202 --> 01:40.988
and she can't help but be upset.

01:40.988 --> 01:42.639
She's over the top.

01:42.639 --> 01:44.511
(snaps belt)

01:44.511 --> 01:47.106
- My beautiful wife, my boss,

01:47.106 --> 01:49.724
sometimes she's not so nice to me.

01:49.724 --> 01:53.107
- Why do you always have to
dress like a goddamn like bum?

01:53.107 --> 01:55.755
- There has been a time where
I called her a psycho bitch

01:55.755 --> 01:57.565
'cause she was being a psycho bitch.

01:57.565 --> 01:58.949
- Clean up, man.

01:58.949 --> 02:00.504
I'm done with this.

02:00.504 --> 02:02.420
- I don't feel like Lisa's authentic.

02:02.420 --> 02:05.169
When she's crying, I don't
feel like she ever means it.

02:05.169 --> 02:07.336
(sobbing)

02:09.640 --> 02:12.561
- Jonathan and Lisa live
in a room at the inn.

02:12.561 --> 02:14.217
You can hear them screaming at each other.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.744
You can hear it in the dining room.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.343
So there's no boundaries.

02:17.343 --> 02:19.480
They'll come down after the
shift at the end of the night,

02:19.480 --> 02:21.355
and they'll have cigars, have some drinks.

02:21.355 --> 02:23.977
The environment can quickly
become unprofessional.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.432
- She'll go up to a
table and ask them about,

02:25.432 --> 02:26.688
like, their sex lives.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.912
- You are good-looking.

02:28.912 --> 02:31.123
- We don't get that many
locals at the Vienna.

02:31.123 --> 02:34.148
There's, like, a lot of things
that people think in town

02:34.148 --> 02:35.368
about the Vienna,

02:35.368 --> 02:37.921
and I think it's become a little taboo.

02:37.921 --> 02:40.143
- You have those rumours going around.

02:40.143 --> 02:42.004
People say, "Ooh, the Vienna.

02:42.004 --> 02:43.090
They're all swingers.

02:43.090 --> 02:44.401
It's a big brothel."

02:44.401 --> 02:46.589
It's just ridiculous.

02:46.589 --> 02:48.746
It's ridiculous.

02:48.746 --> 02:52.296
- That being said, we're
very friendly people.

02:52.296 --> 02:53.463
Very friendly.

02:55.077 --> 02:57.685
(gentle music)

02:57.685 --> 02:59.849
- People from the outside
think the Vienna's

02:59.849 --> 03:02.311
doing very well and we're very prosperous,

03:02.311 --> 03:04.829
but somewhere in there, we're losing.

03:04.829 --> 03:06.559
- They're dragging us down with them,

03:06.559 --> 03:08.488
and if they want us to help them,

03:08.488 --> 03:10.238
they need to help us.

03:11.506 --> 03:15.740
- The Vienna is our home,
has been for 13-plus years.

03:15.740 --> 03:19.073
And, you know, it's hanging by a thread.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.913
(melodic music)

03:32.005 --> 03:34.228
- And this, 5:30 at table five.

03:34.228 --> 03:35.456
- He's walking right in.

03:35.456 --> 03:37.623
We wanna be ready for him.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.060
- Look at this place.

03:40.060 --> 03:41.031
My God.

03:41.031 --> 03:42.781
What happened to him?

03:43.866 --> 03:46.705
He didn't last very long, did he?

03:46.705 --> 03:49.288
- [Jonathan] He found our cat.

03:50.643 --> 03:52.156
- Well, bloody hell.

03:52.156 --> 03:53.736
Dead cat and a cabbage.

03:53.736 --> 03:55.319
- Isn't that funny?

03:56.166 --> 03:57.900
Hello, welcome.
- Good morning.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.038
Nice to meet you.

03:59.038 --> 03:59.871
- Likewise, good to see you too.

03:59.871 --> 04:00.704
Gordon.

04:00.704 --> 04:01.656
First name is?

04:01.656 --> 04:02.637
- Melissa.
- Melissa.

04:02.637 --> 04:03.668
- Good morning.

04:03.668 --> 04:04.501
How are you?
- How are you?

04:04.501 --> 04:05.334
Lisa Krach.

04:05.334 --> 04:06.167
- Lisa, nice to see you.

04:06.167 --> 04:07.275
You don't look very happy.

04:07.275 --> 04:08.608
- I do.

04:08.608 --> 04:10.545
It's my resting face.
- Oh, this is your happy face?

04:10.545 --> 04:11.500
- Wow.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.988
- Yes, welcome to the Vienna.

04:12.988 --> 04:14.032
- So happy to be here.

04:14.032 --> 04:15.470
What happened to the cat?

04:15.470 --> 04:16.526
(Lisa chuckles)

04:16.526 --> 04:17.358
Poor thing.

04:17.358 --> 04:18.493
- [Lisa] Cat got run over.

04:18.493 --> 04:19.326
- Oh, I see.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.658
And you got it stuffed?

04:20.658 --> 04:21.589
- [Lisa] For Halloween.

04:21.589 --> 04:22.548
- [Gordon] Right.

04:22.548 --> 04:25.672
- Actually, better to see you now.

04:25.672 --> 04:27.651
- Right, yeah.

04:27.651 --> 04:29.822
Love the attire, by the way.

04:29.822 --> 04:31.037
- Thank you.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.575
Everyone wears this.

04:32.575 --> 04:33.491
- Wow.

04:33.491 --> 04:34.886
How much are the outfits?

04:34.886 --> 04:36.442
- About $300, $400.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.303
- $300?

04:37.303 --> 04:38.650
- Average, you know.
- $300.

04:38.650 --> 04:39.645
They get their own.

04:39.645 --> 04:41.202
I mean, they're their
own dresses, you know?

04:41.202 --> 04:42.355
- Oh, you buy your own uniforms?

04:42.355 --> 04:43.188
- Yes.
- Yes, they do.

04:43.188 --> 04:44.021
- Stop it.

04:44.021 --> 04:44.854
- [Melissa] We do.

04:44.854 --> 04:45.998
- Well, they have 'em for many years.

04:45.998 --> 04:47.838
And it reminds them to not gain weight.

04:47.838 --> 04:49.915
(chuckles)

04:49.915 --> 04:51.954
- [Gordon] Wow, so who designed the place?

04:51.954 --> 04:53.921
- Well, my husband and I.

04:53.921 --> 04:56.738
- And whose idea was it to buy it?

04:56.738 --> 04:57.824
- My husband.

04:57.824 --> 04:58.913
- So it wasn't yours?

04:58.913 --> 04:59.969
- It was not my idea.

04:59.969 --> 05:01.626
I was actually very much against it.

05:01.626 --> 05:02.834
- Wow.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.258
Why were you against it?

05:04.258 --> 05:05.398
- It was very overwhelming.

05:05.398 --> 05:06.988
I had two small children.

05:06.988 --> 05:11.115
Probably, after I lost
my mind the first year...

05:11.115 --> 05:13.191
I think we started to get a hang of it.

05:13.191 --> 05:14.083
- And who's Austrian?

05:14.083 --> 05:14.916
Are you from-

05:14.916 --> 05:16.694
- My husband's half-Austrian and Polish.

05:16.694 --> 05:17.527
- Right.

05:17.527 --> 05:18.897
- I'm not nearly as exotic.

05:18.897 --> 05:19.933
I'm very American.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.545
- Right, and he's the chef, right?

05:21.545 --> 05:24.167
So he runs the restaurant,
kitchen, and you run the inn.

05:24.167 --> 05:25.000
- Correct.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.130
- [Gordon] And whose idea
was the violins on the table?

05:27.130 --> 05:28.136
- [Lisa] Mine.

05:28.136 --> 05:29.443
- [Gordon] Where'd that come from?

05:29.443 --> 05:31.979
- That was actually from an
estate sale down the street.

05:31.979 --> 05:33.515
- A dead man's violin?

05:33.515 --> 05:35.388
- Yeah, why not?

05:35.388 --> 05:37.947
- I don't wanna sit across
a table with my wife

05:37.947 --> 05:39.551
and look at a dead man's violin.

05:39.551 --> 05:40.384
- Well...

05:40.384 --> 05:41.389
- Bit freaky, no?

05:41.389 --> 05:42.222
- I don't know.

05:42.222 --> 05:43.981
What would you rather look
at when you see the Vienna?

05:43.981 --> 05:44.939
- Her.

05:44.939 --> 05:45.876
- Who's her?

05:45.876 --> 05:46.709
- My wife.

05:46.709 --> 05:48.031
- Oh, your wife, yes.

05:48.031 --> 05:52.086
But you have to have something
to make up that white space.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.951
What would you suggest?

05:53.951 --> 05:54.909
- My wife.

05:54.909 --> 05:55.932
(chuckles)

05:55.932 --> 05:57.179
- You gonna put her on the table?

05:57.179 --> 05:58.589
That's kind of scandalous.

05:58.589 --> 06:00.215
- I am so fucking confused.

06:00.215 --> 06:01.637
Dead man's violin.

06:01.637 --> 06:03.833
What about some flowers?

06:03.833 --> 06:08.833
Bloody hell, is this place
always as clustered as this?

06:09.248 --> 06:10.764
And who's that there?

06:10.764 --> 06:12.092
- A Prussian family, of course.

06:12.092 --> 06:16.048
That was Friedrich, that their
family all was murdered...

06:16.048 --> 06:16.881
- Murdered?

06:16.881 --> 06:17.714
- Yes.

06:17.714 --> 06:20.627
- Wow, so dead man's violin,
murderer on the wall.

06:20.627 --> 06:24.095
Great story to encourage a
nice, warm, welcoming dinner.

06:24.095 --> 06:26.977
So why don't I check in upstairs?

06:26.977 --> 06:28.401
- You can do that right now.

06:28.401 --> 06:29.234
- Yes, please.

06:29.234 --> 06:30.067
Yeah why not?

06:30.067 --> 06:30.900
Thank you.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.317
- You're welcome.

06:34.615 --> 06:35.517
- Wow.

06:35.517 --> 06:36.723
Interesting indeed.

06:36.723 --> 06:37.707
Just a clutter.

06:37.707 --> 06:39.188
- [Lisa] Your bedroom's over here.

06:39.188 --> 06:40.146
- [Gordon] Rocking chair?

06:40.146 --> 06:40.979
Where's that from?

06:40.979 --> 06:43.223
- That's actually the first
piece I ever refinished.

06:43.223 --> 06:44.339
- Wow.

06:44.339 --> 06:46.684
So you're quite an antiques hoarder.

06:46.684 --> 06:47.918
(knock at door)

06:47.918 --> 06:48.961
- [Val] Room service.

06:48.961 --> 06:49.957
- Oh, room service.

06:49.957 --> 06:50.915
Come in.

06:50.915 --> 06:51.995
Holy mackerel.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.180
- Now, what we have here
is some pulled boar.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.013
- Shredded.

06:55.013 --> 06:56.124
Shredded.
- Oh, pulled.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.126
- And then you have a little
celery root right on top.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.209
- [Gordon] Wow.

06:59.209 --> 07:00.156
And what's that?

07:00.156 --> 07:01.957
- [Lisa] It's a little parsley.

07:01.957 --> 07:03.040
- Excellent.

07:04.577 --> 07:05.474
Take one.

07:05.474 --> 07:06.880
- Would you like me to have one?

07:06.880 --> 07:07.713
- Yeah, of course.

07:07.713 --> 07:08.999
There's three pieces.

07:08.999 --> 07:09.957
Excellent.
- Okay.

07:09.957 --> 07:10.790
- Sure.

07:10.790 --> 07:11.748
- Thank you.

07:11.748 --> 07:12.666
- Thank you for sharing.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.624
- You're welcome.

07:13.624 --> 07:14.457
Hold on.

07:14.457 --> 07:15.290
Wait, wait.

07:15.290 --> 07:16.123
Let me put a little bit
of the garnish on there...

07:16.123 --> 07:17.013
- You want me to have that?

07:17.013 --> 07:20.263
- Yeah, we'll have a little piece each.

07:28.696 --> 07:31.444
What did you think of that, by the way?

07:31.444 --> 07:34.077
- Celery root, really don't like it.

07:34.077 --> 07:37.366
The pulled boar, maybe
just a bit more salt.

07:37.366 --> 07:38.199
- Wow.

07:38.199 --> 07:39.079
And what did you think of that?

07:39.079 --> 07:40.822
- I think it's a nice
little surprise for people

07:40.822 --> 07:44.246
when they come in to
liven up their appetite.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.770
- [Gordon] Boar was very watery.

07:45.770 --> 07:46.850
- It was very watery.

07:46.850 --> 07:47.767
I did notice that.

07:47.767 --> 07:49.823
- And the bread was soggy, soaking wet.

07:49.823 --> 07:51.255
- From the celery root.

07:51.255 --> 07:52.213
- [Gordon] Thank you.

07:52.213 --> 07:53.380
- Enjoy your stay.

07:53.380 --> 07:55.465
- Please pass on my comments to the chef.

07:55.465 --> 07:57.132
- I definitely will.

07:58.617 --> 07:59.700
- Here we go.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.673
- [Gordon] Oh, dear.

08:02.673 --> 08:03.506
Okay.

08:03.506 --> 08:04.339
Wow.

08:04.339 --> 08:05.613
And who designed these bedrooms?

08:05.613 --> 08:07.418
- I designed everything.

08:07.418 --> 08:08.468
- You designed?

08:08.468 --> 08:09.301
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.301 --> 08:10.834
I wallpapered it as well.

08:10.834 --> 08:12.223
- Seriously?

08:12.223 --> 08:13.823
What's this?

08:13.823 --> 08:15.526
- [Lisa] That's another closet.

08:15.526 --> 08:16.844
- What do you mean, another closet?

08:16.844 --> 08:18.358
- I don't have a closet in my bedroom.

08:18.358 --> 08:20.609
That's the closet that we
have because there's an area

08:20.609 --> 08:22.333
over here for guests to use.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.256
- But where am I gonna hang my clothes?

08:24.256 --> 08:25.756
- Right over here.

08:28.754 --> 08:29.587
- But...

08:31.333 --> 08:33.335
- You don't need an entire closet.

08:33.335 --> 08:35.687
- So if you need clothes
out of your closet

08:35.687 --> 08:37.477
you come in my bedroom?
- I have to plan ahead.

08:37.477 --> 08:39.017
Do you have the key on you?

08:39.017 --> 08:39.850
- I do.

08:39.850 --> 08:40.907
- Can I see inside?

08:40.907 --> 08:43.220
I just, I'm a bit freaked with
locked doors in my bedroom.

08:43.220 --> 08:44.053
- Gosh.

08:44.053 --> 08:45.200
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

08:45.200 --> 08:46.329
Thank you.
- It's okay.

08:46.329 --> 08:47.197
- It's right here.

08:47.197 --> 08:48.222
- Oh, it's there?

08:48.222 --> 08:49.055
Wow.

08:50.805 --> 08:53.244
(chuckles)

08:53.244 --> 08:54.737
- [Lisa] Just my closet.

08:54.737 --> 08:56.130
- Holy crap.

08:56.130 --> 08:57.399
Stop it.
- Yeah.

08:57.399 --> 08:58.232
- Stop it?

08:58.232 --> 08:59.084
- Seriously?

08:59.084 --> 09:00.485
- [Lisa] All my stuff.

09:00.485 --> 09:02.765
- [Gordon] It's like a
garage sale in a closet.

09:02.765 --> 09:04.270
- [Lisa] That's why we keep a lock on it.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.906
- I've got no interest in
wearing any of the garments,

09:05.906 --> 09:07.071
but thank you.

09:07.071 --> 09:07.904
- [Lisa] You sure?

09:07.904 --> 09:09.117
- I'm positive.

09:09.117 --> 09:10.462
100% positive.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.223
Bloody hell.

09:12.223 --> 09:13.895
What's the price of this room?

09:13.895 --> 09:14.989
- [Lisa] This one is 220.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.570
- $220.

09:16.570 --> 09:17.678
Yeah?
- Correct.

09:17.678 --> 09:20.816
And I have to share my
wardrobe with the owner.

09:20.816 --> 09:22.468
What's through this room here?

09:22.468 --> 09:24.602
- [Lisa] That actually goes to my bedroom.

09:24.602 --> 09:25.718
- [Gordon] So do you just walk in

09:25.718 --> 09:27.474
when you need to get some clothes?

09:27.474 --> 09:28.307
- From here?

09:28.307 --> 09:30.530
- No, but from your bedroom to my bedroom.

09:30.530 --> 09:34.392
- [Lisa] Well, I only do
that once or twice a week.

09:34.392 --> 09:35.892
- And what's this?

09:37.058 --> 09:38.174
Wow.

09:38.174 --> 09:40.295
- It's an antique purse that was actually

09:40.295 --> 09:41.668
found in the house,

09:41.668 --> 09:44.916
and we thought it was really
neat to be able to have.

09:44.916 --> 09:47.194
That's a toothbrush
holder in case you decide

09:47.194 --> 09:48.593
to take it along with you.

09:48.593 --> 09:49.842
- That's a toothbrush holder?

09:49.842 --> 09:51.086
- Or you could stick tampons in there

09:51.086 --> 09:53.107
if you really wanted to.

09:53.107 --> 09:54.535
We do usually have those...

09:54.535 --> 09:55.793
Oh, they're not in there right now.

09:55.793 --> 09:56.626
There you go.

09:56.626 --> 09:57.857
- [Gordon] It's an old lady's case.

09:57.857 --> 09:59.765
- Mm-hmm, just trying
to think of clever ideas

09:59.765 --> 10:03.103
to make this feel like a historic inn.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.311
- Historic.

10:04.311 --> 10:05.188
- Mm.

10:05.188 --> 10:06.715
- It's definitely historic.

10:06.715 --> 10:07.798
Oh.

10:07.798 --> 10:08.773
Bloody hell.

10:08.773 --> 10:09.770
How old is that?

10:09.770 --> 10:10.728
- You need that?

10:10.728 --> 10:12.702
- No, just fascinated to
see what's in my basket.

10:12.702 --> 10:14.068
Thank you for that.

10:14.068 --> 10:15.026
Oh, dear.

10:15.026 --> 10:16.262
Everything looks dated.

10:16.262 --> 10:19.831
I mean, first impressions,
it looks very, very tired.

10:19.831 --> 10:21.180
What is all that?

10:21.180 --> 10:23.635
- [Lisa] That's if somebody
wants to throw roses on the bed.

10:23.635 --> 10:24.898
- [Gordon] Oh, for God's sake.

10:24.898 --> 10:26.480
- [Lisa] Isn't that adorable?

10:26.480 --> 10:28.704
- And then they go back in the drawer

10:28.704 --> 10:31.621
once you've used them.
- I guess so.

10:32.642 --> 10:35.146
Okay, well, I'll look forward
to seeing you downstairs.

10:35.146 --> 10:35.991
I'll have lunch.

10:35.991 --> 10:36.824
- Super.

10:36.824 --> 10:37.657
- Thank you.

10:37.657 --> 10:39.301
- You're welcome.

10:39.301 --> 10:40.765
- Wow.

10:40.765 --> 10:41.598
Jesus.

10:43.126 --> 10:44.837
That's freaky.

10:44.837 --> 10:47.799
The owner's bedroom is
literally a metre away.

10:47.799 --> 10:49.581
The place is so dated.

10:49.581 --> 10:50.581
What a mess.

10:52.241 --> 10:53.074
Fuck.

10:54.895 --> 10:57.303
Everything's just cluttered.

10:57.303 --> 10:58.303
What a mess.

11:01.121 --> 11:02.350
Look at this.

11:02.350 --> 11:03.183
Ay-yi-yi.

11:04.322 --> 11:05.822
I mean, seriously.

11:07.056 --> 11:08.151
Bloody hell.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.444
Packed with shit everywhere.

11:10.444 --> 11:11.777
Old decorations.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.180
Terrible.

11:15.180 --> 11:17.847
(gentle music)

11:19.336 --> 11:20.490
Shall I sit here, then?

11:20.490 --> 11:21.323
- Right here.

11:21.323 --> 11:22.641
Have a seat.
- Thank you.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.552
You can sit wherever you prefer.

11:24.552 --> 11:25.862
- Boom, boom, boom.

11:25.862 --> 11:27.042
Let's get some food out.

11:27.042 --> 11:28.148
You wanna get some food out?

11:28.148 --> 11:29.359
- [Man] Yeah.

11:29.359 --> 11:31.131
- What's in here?

11:31.131 --> 11:32.127
Jesus.

11:32.127 --> 11:33.126
Lisa.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.694
There's junk everywhere.

11:34.694 --> 11:35.527
- Mm-hmm.

11:37.352 --> 11:38.409
Yeah, I know.

11:38.409 --> 11:39.326
Everywhere.

11:40.747 --> 11:42.702
- Is the whole house packed like this?

11:42.702 --> 11:44.077
- Of course it is.

11:44.077 --> 11:44.931
It's crazy.
- Why?

11:44.931 --> 11:46.394
- Have you always been this bad?

11:46.394 --> 11:48.652
- It's a new thing I'm
coming to terms with.

11:48.652 --> 11:49.576
- Right.

11:49.576 --> 11:51.119
But you do have a problem with it?

11:51.119 --> 11:52.052
- Actually, no.

11:52.052 --> 11:54.358
I think I've actually gotten
rid of a lot of things

11:54.358 --> 11:55.663
in the past couple years.

11:55.663 --> 11:57.312
- You don't have a problem with everything

11:57.312 --> 11:59.208
I've just seen in the last 10 minutes?

11:59.208 --> 12:00.043
Wow.

12:00.043 --> 12:01.421
Oh, well.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.921
- There you go.

12:02.921 --> 12:04.279
- Right, let's...

12:04.279 --> 12:05.362
Oh, jeez.

12:05.362 --> 12:07.137
Do you know how to say all these?

12:07.137 --> 12:09.728
How do you pronounce that?

12:09.728 --> 12:11.312
You've been here a long time.

12:11.312 --> 12:12.612
You must know the lingo.

12:12.612 --> 12:13.852
(speaking German)

12:13.852 --> 12:14.943
- [Gordon] A lot people must point to

12:14.943 --> 12:16.576
what they want to order, right?

12:16.576 --> 12:17.409
- Yes.

12:17.409 --> 12:18.242
- Or just pick up the last line.

12:18.242 --> 12:19.283
How do you pronounce that?

12:19.283 --> 12:20.664
- Koenigsberger klopse.

12:20.664 --> 12:21.497
- Wow.

12:21.497 --> 12:23.914
And how long's this menu
been running like this?

12:23.914 --> 12:24.954
- Since the beginning.

12:24.954 --> 12:25.869
- Oh, 13 years ago?

12:25.869 --> 12:26.702
Stop.
- Yes, yes.

12:26.702 --> 12:27.535
Seriously?

12:27.535 --> 12:28.368
- Yes.

12:28.368 --> 12:29.824
- Let's start off with...

12:29.824 --> 12:31.223
Go for the scallops.

12:31.223 --> 12:32.957
Let's do the beer-battered sauerkraut.

12:32.957 --> 12:34.352
Yeah, let's go for that.

12:34.352 --> 12:37.042
And throw the vegetarian
mushroom ravioli in as well.

12:37.042 --> 12:38.000
- Wonderful.

12:38.000 --> 12:38.958
- Okay, great.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.115
I'll keep hold of the menu for now.

12:40.115 --> 12:40.948
- Okay.

12:40.948 --> 12:41.816
- [Gordon] Thank you.

12:41.816 --> 12:43.284
- Sear it in first.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.213
Whoa.

12:44.213 --> 12:45.406
Almost lost it.

12:45.406 --> 12:46.823
Regroup, regroup.

12:48.055 --> 12:49.232
Where is Missy?

12:49.232 --> 12:50.403
- [Val] I'll bring it right out.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.728
- This is Ramsay's first.

12:51.728 --> 12:52.954
- [Val] Red pepper beurre blanc?

12:52.954 --> 12:54.942
- [Jonathan] Yes, sir.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.252
- Our seared diver scallops
with a red pepper beurre blanc.

12:58.252 --> 12:59.228
- Wow, thank you.

12:59.228 --> 13:00.548
And scallops are normally round, right?

13:00.548 --> 13:01.381
- Yes, they are.

13:01.381 --> 13:02.568
We have beautiful sea scallops.

13:02.568 --> 13:04.436
I'm not sure why they cut it up today.

13:04.436 --> 13:05.440
- No, nor am I.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.273
Oh, well...

13:06.273 --> 13:07.296
Thanks.
- Okay, enjoy.

13:07.296 --> 13:08.432
Thank you very much.

13:08.432 --> 13:09.973
Looks like the dog's chewed them.

13:09.973 --> 13:11.473
I mean, seriously.

13:13.909 --> 13:15.761
That's rancid.

13:15.761 --> 13:16.903
(speaks indistinctly)

13:16.903 --> 13:17.736
- [Gordon] Excuse me?

13:17.736 --> 13:18.955
- What you like me to give any
comments to back to the chef?

13:18.955 --> 13:19.788
- Comments?

13:19.788 --> 13:20.752
Yeah, they were shit.

13:20.752 --> 13:21.585
- [Val] Thank you.

13:21.585 --> 13:22.543
- Terrible.

13:22.543 --> 13:24.546
We'll have Val take care of it for you.

13:24.546 --> 13:25.438
- Who's Val?

13:25.438 --> 13:26.271
- Me.

13:26.271 --> 13:27.104
- [Gordon] I like the way you talk about

13:27.104 --> 13:28.385
yourself in third person.

13:28.385 --> 13:30.889
- [Val] Seared diver
scallops taste like shit.

13:30.889 --> 13:32.539
- Taste like shit, really?

13:32.539 --> 13:33.372
Wow.

13:33.372 --> 13:34.205
Okay.

13:34.205 --> 13:35.871
Any specific kind of shit or just...

13:35.871 --> 13:36.704
- [Val] No.

13:36.704 --> 13:38.299
- Diarrhoea.
- General shit.

13:38.299 --> 13:39.161
- Wow.

13:39.161 --> 13:43.205
- These here are the
Sauerkraut en Backtieg.

13:43.205 --> 13:45.021
- [Gordon] And are these
edible flowers or not?

13:45.021 --> 13:45.854
- [Melissa] They are.

13:45.854 --> 13:46.687
Chrysanthemums.

13:46.687 --> 13:47.520
- They are?

13:47.520 --> 13:48.397
Okay, great, thank you.

13:48.397 --> 13:49.712
- All right.

13:49.712 --> 13:50.545
- Hmm.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.289
Dear oh dear.

13:56.025 --> 13:57.813
They are terrible.

13:57.813 --> 13:59.705
I mean, the food is so dated.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.061
It's extraordinary.

14:01.061 --> 14:04.561
They look like a pair of camel's bollocks.

14:05.590 --> 14:06.423
Hmm.

14:07.470 --> 14:11.771
- This I have here is the mushroom crepes.

14:11.771 --> 14:12.997
- Tarragon crÃ¨me.

14:12.997 --> 14:13.830
Wow.

14:13.830 --> 14:16.163
I mean, what a fucking mess.

14:19.697 --> 14:20.692
There she is.

14:20.692 --> 14:21.774
Fucking hell.

14:21.774 --> 14:22.982
Val.

14:22.982 --> 14:23.815
Val.

14:23.815 --> 14:24.648
- [Val] Yes?

14:24.648 --> 14:25.917
- Delicious.

14:25.917 --> 14:27.014
I mean, fucking-

14:27.014 --> 14:27.847
- You're kidding me?

14:27.847 --> 14:28.916
- No, no, fucking delicious.

14:28.916 --> 14:29.749
Seriously.

14:29.749 --> 14:30.602
Really good.

14:30.602 --> 14:32.040
No, the flowers I'm on about.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.802
- Oh, you had me going
there for a whole second.

14:33.802 --> 14:35.456
I thought it was all about the food.

14:35.456 --> 14:36.461
I...

14:36.461 --> 14:37.763
- Maybe next course.

14:37.763 --> 14:39.941
- [Val] Jonathan, the flowers
are absolutely delicious.

14:39.941 --> 14:41.234
- The flowers?

14:41.234 --> 14:43.937
- And this menu doesn't
change every decade?

14:43.937 --> 14:45.666
It's the same menu that's
been on for 13 years?

14:45.666 --> 14:46.769
- [Lisa] Jonathan doesn't change much.

14:46.769 --> 14:47.795
- Except for the additions.

14:47.795 --> 14:49.398
- Oh, sorry, I asked you a
question, Lisa always answers.

14:49.398 --> 14:50.231
Go on, you.

14:50.231 --> 14:51.459
- Jonathan doesn't change much.

14:51.459 --> 14:52.311
- Oh Jesus.

14:52.311 --> 14:53.144
- [Lisa] I'm sorry.

14:53.144 --> 14:54.649
- You answer Melissa's question first

14:54.649 --> 14:55.791
then I'll go back to Melissa.

14:55.791 --> 14:57.634
- You said this doesn't
change but once a decade,

14:57.634 --> 14:59.564
and I said, "Jonathan
doesn't change much."

14:59.564 --> 15:00.397
- Right.

15:02.647 --> 15:04.274
You've been here a long time.

15:04.274 --> 15:06.497
You've seen the place in decline.

15:06.497 --> 15:08.151
What's the big issues here?

15:08.151 --> 15:10.093
- Little disorganisation.

15:10.093 --> 15:11.178
Things unclear.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.011
- Yeah.

15:12.011 --> 15:12.861
Nothing consistent?

15:12.861 --> 15:13.694
- Yeah.

15:13.694 --> 15:15.031
And, you know, one puts the other on edge,

15:15.031 --> 15:16.957
and we get the brunt end of it.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.505
- Lisa's listening to
every word you're saying.

15:19.505 --> 15:21.883
- I can barely hear you.

15:21.883 --> 15:24.312
- No, no, I was just talking to Melissa.

15:24.312 --> 15:25.145
- Okay, I'm sorry.

15:25.145 --> 15:25.978
I'll leave.

15:25.978 --> 15:28.509
- Do whatever you need to do.

15:28.509 --> 15:30.992
What's the worst thing
she's ever done to you?

15:30.992 --> 15:33.084
- Smacked me on the back of the head

15:33.084 --> 15:34.854
in front of the customers.

15:34.854 --> 15:35.937
- Seriously?

15:35.937 --> 15:37.375
In front of the customers?

15:37.375 --> 15:38.208
- Not hard.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.487
But still, demeaning.

15:40.487 --> 15:42.396
- Yeah, I'll say.

15:42.396 --> 15:43.601
Damn.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.205
- He said it was under-seasoned?

15:45.205 --> 15:46.184
- Over-seasoned?

15:46.184 --> 15:47.329
- [Lisa] Under-seasoned.

15:47.329 --> 15:48.249
- [Jonathan] Really?

15:48.249 --> 15:49.082
Which?

15:49.082 --> 15:50.420
- [Lisa] Everything.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.253
- Wow.

15:51.253 --> 15:52.599
Where's Lisa?

15:52.599 --> 15:55.434
- I will grab her for you
right away, Mr. Gordon.

15:55.434 --> 15:57.409
- And grab Jonathan, too,
as well, will you, please?

15:57.409 --> 15:59.211
And anybody else in the kitchen, please.

15:59.211 --> 16:00.294
- [Val] Okay.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.359
Excuse me, Lisa, Jonathan.

16:02.359 --> 16:03.247
- Yes?

16:03.247 --> 16:05.174
- Can we meet up in front with Gordon?

16:05.174 --> 16:08.424
- That's the most edible thing in here.

16:09.895 --> 16:10.728
Right.

16:10.728 --> 16:12.046
Ooh, la.

16:12.046 --> 16:13.444
First impressions...

16:13.444 --> 16:16.322
I look outside, historic inn.

16:16.322 --> 16:18.786
Unfortunately, you've misspelt that.

16:18.786 --> 16:20.012
It's prehistoric.

16:20.012 --> 16:21.463
Everything's so dated.

16:21.463 --> 16:23.434
I go up to the room,
and the room's shoddy.

16:23.434 --> 16:25.468
Jonathan, do you not think
it's a bit weird that,

16:25.468 --> 16:27.532
A, my door's open
adjacent to your bedroom,

16:27.532 --> 16:31.639
but your wife's clothes are in my closet?

16:31.639 --> 16:33.302
- I never thought of it that way,

16:33.302 --> 16:35.286
but I guess that is odd.
- It's weird.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.953
- That was shocking.

16:37.794 --> 16:39.796
You just served me one
of the worst lunches

16:39.796 --> 16:41.818
I've ever eaten.

16:41.818 --> 16:45.224
And it was that bad I started
eating the edible flowers.

16:45.224 --> 16:47.824
You can't be proud of
what you just served me

16:47.824 --> 16:49.065
and charged me.
- No, absolutely not.

16:49.065 --> 16:49.898
- Absolutely not.

16:49.898 --> 16:50.731
You're correct.

16:50.731 --> 16:53.064
- You clearly have given up.

16:54.284 --> 16:56.860
It tastes like it, and it feels like it.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.384
- What do you think we should do?

16:58.384 --> 17:01.283
- Close, because your heart's not in it.

17:01.283 --> 17:04.693
And I think your head's
just in with the clouds.

17:04.693 --> 17:05.776
Embarrassing.

17:09.214 --> 17:11.131
- Pretty fucking awful.

17:13.856 --> 17:14.689
It sucked.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.431
- Caught me off guard completely.

17:19.431 --> 17:21.380
- I mean, you knew he was coming.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.213
- I did.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.453
- Really embarrassing.

17:28.453 --> 17:31.703
I really thought we tried harder and...

17:37.984 --> 17:39.245
- I let you down.

17:39.245 --> 17:40.078
I'm sorry.

17:40.078 --> 17:41.228
- You did let me down.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.728
- [Jonathan] I'm really sorry.

17:45.316 --> 17:47.744
- I always try to tell you
that we need to change things

17:47.744 --> 17:49.304
and we need to make them sexier,

17:49.304 --> 17:51.336
and you never wanna listen to me.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.433
(crying)

17:53.433 --> 17:55.021
I've always wanted to change,

17:55.021 --> 17:57.874
and you always say I'm
too random, and it's not.

17:57.874 --> 17:58.826
I'm not random.

17:58.826 --> 18:00.812
I'm trying to show you ideas and things

18:00.812 --> 18:03.309
that we could do differently.

18:03.309 --> 18:05.476
(sobbing)

18:09.456 --> 18:12.039
(tense music)

18:16.587 --> 18:17.704
This sucks.

18:17.704 --> 18:20.009
You couldn't have cooked
worse than you did.

18:20.009 --> 18:21.224
Can you pull my ankle?

18:21.224 --> 18:22.388
It hurts so much.

18:22.388 --> 18:24.083
I'm never gonna be able to walk tonight.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.679
Oh, God.

18:25.679 --> 18:27.315
Don't worry about it.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.367
We'll be fine.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.887
We'll figure something out.

18:29.887 --> 18:31.825
He doesn't fucking listen to me, does he?

18:31.825 --> 18:33.742
Oh, that feels so good.

18:34.873 --> 18:36.562
I'm not really that upset.

18:36.562 --> 18:39.556
I'm just crying because
I want to right now.

18:39.556 --> 18:41.332
- I've heard rumours around town

18:41.332 --> 18:43.977
that the basement is known
as a swingers' hangout

18:43.977 --> 18:46.038
and is used for late-night parties.

18:46.038 --> 18:48.518
So, before dinner service,
I want to take a look

18:48.518 --> 18:50.905
at what's downstairs.

18:50.905 --> 18:52.113
Wow.

18:52.113 --> 18:53.196
Look at this.

18:54.261 --> 18:55.094
My God.

18:57.264 --> 18:59.475
Some really expensive stuff.

18:59.475 --> 19:00.539
This is crazy.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.966
I can't believe how much
stock there is here.

19:02.966 --> 19:04.516
It's like they're spending their money

19:04.516 --> 19:06.477
in all the wrong places.

19:06.477 --> 19:07.400
Look at that.

19:07.400 --> 19:09.567
This place goes on and on.

19:11.107 --> 19:12.024
Oh, my God.

19:13.346 --> 19:16.842
Please shower before
entering the mineral spa.

19:16.842 --> 19:17.842
Mineral spa.

19:19.181 --> 19:20.098
Oh, my God.

19:23.067 --> 19:25.023
This place is like a dungeon.

19:25.023 --> 19:27.023
A dungeon for swingers.

19:28.225 --> 19:30.793
Tonight is crucial because
I need to get my eyes

19:30.793 --> 19:33.621
on how Jonathan and Lisa
are running the hotel,

19:33.621 --> 19:36.374
since both of them seem
to be on different pages.

19:36.374 --> 19:38.131
- Can I get you beverages to start with?

19:38.131 --> 19:39.375
- We're getting some wine.

19:39.375 --> 19:43.120
- Okay, I was thinking
cosmos, but wine is great.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.679
- There's so much stuff in here.

19:44.679 --> 19:46.460
I've never seen a kitchen so cluttered.

19:46.460 --> 19:48.324
- It's been worse, believe it or not.

19:48.324 --> 19:50.103
- [Gordon] How come the
food just sits there?

19:50.103 --> 19:53.685
- Right at the moment, our
timing is really not at all good.

19:53.685 --> 19:55.449
- [Gordon] What are these for, Jonathan?

19:55.449 --> 19:56.921
- [Jonathan] Those are little pre-meals.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.639
Little crackers, little piece of cheese.

19:58.639 --> 19:59.472
- Pre-meals.

19:59.472 --> 20:01.697
Can I give that to you
to get rid of, please?

20:01.697 --> 20:02.709
- To get rid of?

20:02.709 --> 20:04.375
- Yeah, i.e. trash.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.208
- Oh.

20:05.208 --> 20:07.582
- You can't serve that on bits of paper

20:07.582 --> 20:09.023
for customers to eat.

20:09.023 --> 20:12.047
You can't ask them to
dip into a fucking doily

20:12.047 --> 20:14.201
with a cracker and then a flower.

20:14.201 --> 20:15.700
Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.533
It's just...

20:16.533 --> 20:17.503
No, it's a bit fucked up.

20:17.503 --> 20:18.461
Do you know what I mean?

20:18.461 --> 20:22.948
It's not your place, but
it's just a bit weird.

20:22.948 --> 20:24.433
(exhales deeply)

20:24.433 --> 20:25.266
You okay?

20:25.266 --> 20:26.099
- Yeah.

20:26.099 --> 20:26.932
No, I'm fine.

20:26.932 --> 20:27.765
I'm okay.

20:27.765 --> 20:29.232
- When were the chickens roasted?

20:29.232 --> 20:30.219
- Two days ago.

20:30.219 --> 20:32.110
That's the last of them.

20:32.110 --> 20:34.191
- Why do we roast them
two days in advance?

20:34.191 --> 20:35.697
- They're delivered twice a week.

20:35.697 --> 20:37.734
They're cooked up the delivery day.

20:37.734 --> 20:40.869
- What kind of impression do
you think you're sending out

20:40.869 --> 20:42.509
to your customers when
that chicken's roasted

20:42.509 --> 20:44.149
two days before they come?

20:44.149 --> 20:45.816
- I-I-I...

20:52.763 --> 20:55.362
- When do you think this
chicken was roasted?

20:55.362 --> 20:56.536
You ordered it...

20:56.536 --> 20:57.369
- Oh, my goodness.

20:57.369 --> 20:58.327
I hope it was today.

20:58.327 --> 21:00.283
- It was roasted two and a half days ago.

21:00.283 --> 21:02.740
- I am not happy to hear that at all.

21:02.740 --> 21:04.946
- That was gonna be dry as a dog's bone.

21:04.946 --> 21:06.608
But anyway, try to enjoy.

21:06.608 --> 21:07.492
- [Male] Okay, thanks.

21:07.492 --> 21:08.573
- I don't feel well anymore.

21:08.573 --> 21:10.446
Thank you, I will try.

21:10.446 --> 21:12.276
- They've been coming for 12 years.

21:12.276 --> 21:15.331
You need to seriously just focus
on getting this night done.

21:15.331 --> 21:16.737
And they sit there all schmuck.

21:16.737 --> 21:18.517
I wanna kick them out right now.

21:18.517 --> 21:20.590
Do you want us to take the food back?

21:20.590 --> 21:22.647
I mean, this is, like, so disappointing

21:22.647 --> 21:23.980
that you guys feel this way.

21:23.980 --> 21:25.245
I thought we were friends,

21:25.245 --> 21:26.502
and I thought you would've maybe told us

21:26.502 --> 21:28.592
if you felt the food
sucked that much, you know?

21:28.592 --> 21:29.425
It's really...

21:29.425 --> 21:30.508
Gosh, I feel...

21:30.508 --> 21:32.579
I feel like I wanna pass out right now.

21:32.579 --> 21:33.912
- Fucking hell.

21:35.897 --> 21:37.934
The lady you were just
talking to over there

21:37.934 --> 21:41.318
had no idea her chicken was
roasted two and a half days ago.

21:41.318 --> 21:43.347
- It was roasted two and a half days ago?

21:43.347 --> 21:44.180
- [Gordon] Yeah.

21:44.180 --> 21:45.232
- I didn't know that.

21:45.232 --> 21:46.688
I mean, it's not my business
with him in the kitchen.

21:46.688 --> 21:47.521
- No, I'm just...

21:47.521 --> 21:49.852
God, you two are so defensive.

21:49.852 --> 21:52.209
- There's 1,000 different
ways to make spaetzle.

21:52.209 --> 21:53.350
- That has nothing to do with it.

21:53.350 --> 21:54.795
I'm talking about the chicken.

21:54.795 --> 21:56.338
- I'd love to find out the proper way.

21:56.338 --> 21:58.044
- Chicken, I'm talking
to you about the chicken.

21:58.044 --> 21:59.309
- Yeah, well...

21:59.309 --> 22:01.446
- Make an excuse again.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.029
Nothing resonates with you, does it?

22:04.029 --> 22:05.103
- It certainly does.

22:05.103 --> 22:07.780
Absolutely, it all does.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.363
- What in the hell?

22:10.731 --> 22:13.530
- Ah, I just wanted to
keep it together tonight.

22:13.530 --> 22:14.840
That's all.

22:14.840 --> 22:17.185
(laughing)

22:17.185 --> 22:18.039
Ah, crazy.

22:18.039 --> 22:19.476
- Are you, like, manic or something?

22:19.476 --> 22:20.309
- I'm manic.

22:20.309 --> 22:22.370
Yes, I am right now.

22:22.370 --> 22:23.675
How's it going, guys?

22:23.675 --> 22:25.943
- Something between shitty and awful.

22:25.943 --> 22:27.338
What does it mean when it feels like

22:27.338 --> 22:28.752
an elephant's sitting on your chest?

22:28.752 --> 22:30.027
- Oh, you don't have a heart.

22:30.027 --> 22:31.627
You can't have a heart attack.

22:31.627 --> 22:33.122
- [Jonathan] Are you hungry, Gordon?

22:33.122 --> 22:34.372
- What is this?

22:37.012 --> 22:37.956
- That is bacon.

22:37.956 --> 22:39.533
Should be on a different shelf.

22:39.533 --> 22:40.519
- And this here?

22:40.519 --> 22:45.344
- [Jonathan] That shouldn't
be thrown there either.

22:45.344 --> 22:46.275
- [Gordon] What's that?

22:46.275 --> 22:47.753
- [Jonathan] Beer batter for
the beer-battered shrimp.

22:47.753 --> 22:50.606
That should be thrown out.

22:50.606 --> 22:51.647
- And this one?

22:51.647 --> 22:52.714
Let me just set that on top.

22:52.714 --> 22:54.153
- Sure, put it right on top.

22:54.153 --> 22:56.486
- [Gordon] What is all this?

22:58.738 --> 23:00.155
- That was bacon.

23:01.689 --> 23:02.836
- No, no, no.

23:02.836 --> 23:03.812
- Okay.

23:03.812 --> 23:05.444
- Why is it in the fridge like this?

23:05.444 --> 23:07.557
- I dropped it one shelf below.

23:07.557 --> 23:09.019
Instead of putting it where it belongs,

23:09.019 --> 23:10.256
I put it on the corner.

23:10.256 --> 23:11.648
Normally these things are pretty orderly.

23:11.648 --> 23:15.059
This is a complete cluster fuck.

23:15.059 --> 23:16.191
- And what's that?

23:16.191 --> 23:18.046
- Corned beef.

23:18.046 --> 23:19.549
- Let's get outside.

23:19.549 --> 23:21.466
Lisa, let's go outside.

23:23.547 --> 23:25.193
What is going on?

23:25.193 --> 23:27.539
The whole operation is screwed.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.369
The kitchen, shocking.

23:29.369 --> 23:31.000
The line, disaster.

23:31.000 --> 23:34.107
Cross-contaminated, raw meat, cooked meat.

23:34.107 --> 23:35.421
Shit everywhere.

23:35.421 --> 23:37.856
And then the biggest asset
where all the money is

23:37.856 --> 23:40.208
is downstairs in the wine cellar.

23:40.208 --> 23:42.630
Who's maintaining standards here?

23:42.630 --> 23:43.463
- He is.

23:43.463 --> 23:47.203
- I cannot believe what
you've just done in there.

23:47.203 --> 23:48.565
- I really enjoy it.

23:48.565 --> 23:49.842
- You can't enjoy that.

23:49.842 --> 23:51.015
- I swear to God, I do.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.688
I must be, like, cuckoo
in the head or something.

23:52.688 --> 23:53.695
- Well, you need help.

23:53.695 --> 23:54.528
- Maybe.

23:54.528 --> 23:55.486
- He does.

23:55.486 --> 23:57.319
- You need to wake up.

24:01.078 --> 24:01.911
Fuck me.

24:05.511 --> 24:06.748
- I think we can do this.

24:06.748 --> 24:07.934
I know we can do this.

24:07.934 --> 24:10.225
- Yeah, but not just you and you.

24:10.225 --> 24:11.797
I want it to be you and I,

24:11.797 --> 24:14.186
because you so don't listen
to me most of the time.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.011
Like, when I tell you, "It's
time to come home, Jonathan.

24:17.011 --> 24:18.942
It's time to fucking come to bed."

24:18.942 --> 24:20.667
And you just say, "Fuck you."

24:20.667 --> 24:22.522
You know, fuck you now.

24:22.522 --> 24:24.315
Fuck you, Jonathan.

24:24.315 --> 24:26.610
I love you so much and
you're such a great guy,

24:26.610 --> 24:28.620
but you suck as a business partner.

24:28.620 --> 24:30.029
You really suck.

24:30.029 --> 24:30.862
- Thanks.

24:30.862 --> 24:32.332
So you wanna re-create this.

24:32.332 --> 24:33.481
You wanna...

24:33.481 --> 24:34.510
- Get divorced.

24:34.510 --> 24:35.526
- I don't wanna get divorced.

24:35.526 --> 24:36.420
You wanna get divorced?

24:36.420 --> 24:37.799
- No, I don't wanna get divorced.

24:37.799 --> 24:40.229
Why has it always been your way?

24:40.229 --> 24:42.193
'Cause you know more than me?

24:42.193 --> 24:43.709
- Apparently I don't.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.501
I'm as stupid as you
think I am, if not worse.

24:46.501 --> 24:47.334
(Lisa sighs)

24:47.334 --> 24:48.735
- Thank God.

24:48.735 --> 24:50.933
Let's go in the back door.

24:50.933 --> 24:51.766
Fuck me.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.435
Okay, give me a drink.

24:54.435 --> 24:57.253
I couldn't get this down fast enough.

24:57.253 --> 24:58.906
That looks pretty good.

24:58.906 --> 24:59.739
All right.

24:59.739 --> 25:02.173
(bottles clinking)

25:02.173 --> 25:03.760
Have a nice night.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.486
(Melissa chuckles)

25:06.486 --> 25:07.790
(Lisa sighs)

25:07.790 --> 25:09.547
- [Melissa] It's gonna be okay.

25:09.547 --> 25:11.515
- Thanks for being on the other side.

25:11.515 --> 25:12.682
Appreciate it.

25:14.703 --> 25:15.666
(coughs)

25:15.666 --> 25:16.627
Oh, sorry.

25:16.627 --> 25:18.345
(coughing)

25:18.345 --> 25:20.409
That bourbon was really strong.

25:20.409 --> 25:22.185
(coughing)

25:22.185 --> 25:23.018
Crap.

25:24.477 --> 25:25.571
- Crying again?

25:25.571 --> 25:27.653
- It's not really crying.

25:27.653 --> 25:29.360
It's just releasing.

25:29.360 --> 25:30.499
- Release it.

25:30.499 --> 25:32.519
- Lisa, can I have you
and him together, please?

25:32.519 --> 25:33.686
- [Lisa] Sure.

25:37.210 --> 25:39.996
- I'm unconvinced, and
I've never met a couple

25:39.996 --> 25:41.908
so undeserving of my time.

25:41.908 --> 25:45.424
And I think you, Lisa,
you're just faking it.

25:45.424 --> 25:46.566
- I'm just trying to-

25:46.566 --> 25:47.477
- [Gordon] No, just-

25:47.477 --> 25:48.867
- Trying to get through the night tonight.

25:48.867 --> 25:49.964
- No, you're acting.

25:49.964 --> 25:51.280
The crocodile tears are there.

25:51.280 --> 25:52.551
Next minute's a laugh.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.112
- It's self-preservation.

25:54.112 --> 25:56.662
And it's the only way for
me to get through the day.

25:56.662 --> 25:57.651
- There's no heart.

25:57.651 --> 25:58.623
There's no feeling.

25:58.623 --> 25:59.567
- There's a lot of heart.

25:59.567 --> 26:00.635
- No, there's not.

26:00.635 --> 26:02.183
- I love what I do.

26:02.183 --> 26:04.314
- And what do you love,
drinking with your friends?

26:04.314 --> 26:06.093
- I don't do much drinking.

26:06.093 --> 26:07.608
I'm not the party girl.

26:07.608 --> 26:08.998
He's the party boy.

26:08.998 --> 26:11.685
- So there's no parties way
on after service downstairs

26:11.685 --> 26:13.923
in the basement with the customers?

26:13.923 --> 26:16.376
- Not in the past, like, 10 years.

26:16.376 --> 26:18.965
- Jonathan, you've lost interest.

26:18.965 --> 26:20.212
- I'm a mess.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.735
- [Lisa] Yeah, you are.

26:22.735 --> 26:26.150
- So the first thing I want you
both to do is to pack a bag.

26:26.150 --> 26:28.650
I want you to get out of here.

26:29.979 --> 26:31.851
Start packing.

26:31.851 --> 26:34.351
(tense music)

26:39.180 --> 26:41.585
After sending Lisa and
Jonathan away for the night,

26:41.585 --> 26:43.409
I'm hoping they can start to realise

26:43.409 --> 26:45.947
the effects they are having on the Vienna.

26:45.947 --> 26:49.189
But before they return, I
called a staff meeting...

26:49.189 --> 26:50.022
Morning.

26:50.022 --> 26:51.034
- Good morning.
- Morning.

26:51.034 --> 26:51.867
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

26:51.867 --> 26:53.352
- So I can get a better understanding

26:53.352 --> 26:57.735
of the damage that Lisa
and Jonathan are doing.

26:57.735 --> 26:59.796
I didn't get a chance
to meet you yesterday.

26:59.796 --> 27:00.629
- I'm Jamie.

27:00.629 --> 27:01.851
Do the housekeeping here.

27:01.851 --> 27:02.694
- Okay, great.

27:02.694 --> 27:03.925
Let's get one thing right.

27:03.925 --> 27:04.970
I'm here to help.

27:04.970 --> 27:06.793
Having done my research, I mean,

27:06.793 --> 27:09.028
the one positive feedback I've had

27:09.028 --> 27:10.599
is about how good the staff are,

27:10.599 --> 27:12.835
'cause I know, you know,
just how bad things are,

27:12.835 --> 27:15.092
and having witnessed
that service last night,

27:15.092 --> 27:16.118
I'm appalled.

27:16.118 --> 27:17.398
Is it always like that?

27:17.398 --> 27:18.231
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:18.231 --> 27:19.174
- [Gordon] The screaming?

27:19.174 --> 27:20.007
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:20.007 --> 27:20.840
- At each other-

27:20.840 --> 27:22.355
- People can hear them in the dining room.

27:22.355 --> 27:24.096
I've had tables that have asked

27:24.096 --> 27:26.162
if everything was okay in the kitchen.

27:26.162 --> 27:29.386
- We can't be expected to
be professional all the time

27:29.386 --> 27:31.276
when they're not professional.

27:31.276 --> 27:33.727
- After our shift, they'll
sit down with a table

27:33.727 --> 27:35.573
and expect us to wait on them,

27:35.573 --> 27:37.123
hand them drinks till midnight.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.713
If we leave, they get upset.

27:38.713 --> 27:40.590
So guests stay here, and
they're drinking downstairs

27:40.590 --> 27:42.721
in front of those guests,
sometimes with the guests.

27:42.721 --> 27:45.805
See, there's no separation
between business and personal.

27:45.805 --> 27:47.906
- When you're sitting here
entertaining your table,

27:47.906 --> 27:50.206
she'll find something
wrong that you're doing,

27:50.206 --> 27:51.905
and she'll come and point it at you

27:51.905 --> 27:53.530
right in front of your table.

27:53.530 --> 27:54.492
- She's just rude.

27:54.492 --> 27:57.192
She texts me sometimes really
rude text messages like,

27:57.192 --> 27:59.686
oh, you forgot this or you forgot that,

27:59.686 --> 28:02.043
or why didn't you do this
and why wasn't this done?

28:02.043 --> 28:03.077
- It's crazy.

28:03.077 --> 28:04.821
- Another problem that
we've really been having

28:04.821 --> 28:06.859
is we don't have an actual payroll system.

28:06.859 --> 28:08.233
- There's no payroll system?

28:08.233 --> 28:09.578
- And then they'll say,
"Yeah, I'll get you one."

28:09.578 --> 28:10.877
And you just never...

28:10.877 --> 28:12.301
- Asking for your salary?

28:12.301 --> 28:14.236
- Yeah, we have to ask for our checks.

28:14.236 --> 28:15.955
- Yeah, I got 20 bucks right now,

28:15.955 --> 28:17.413
that's all I got right now, here.

28:17.413 --> 28:19.002
Tomorrow morning I'll see you.

28:19.002 --> 28:21.325
- They're drip-feeding your salaries.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.027
- My bank does not take the checks.

28:23.027 --> 28:24.142
- Neither does mine.

28:24.142 --> 28:25.854
- When was the last time
you had a staff meeting

28:25.854 --> 28:27.017
and discussed this?

28:27.017 --> 28:28.022
- [All] Never.

28:28.022 --> 28:30.194
- I'm sorry, but I wanna
put an end to all this.

28:30.194 --> 28:32.623
Here's what we're gonna do.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.338
They're arriving any minute now.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.829
And my message to them is
if they're not prepared

28:37.829 --> 28:40.325
to bring in a level of professionalism

28:40.325 --> 28:42.341
and understand those
boundaries need to be met

28:42.341 --> 28:44.852
on a daily basis, they're
gonna lose the inn

28:44.852 --> 28:46.245
and they're gonna lose you.

28:46.245 --> 28:48.736
Let me go and get them.

28:48.736 --> 28:51.184
- I let myself continue to be abused.

28:51.184 --> 28:53.411
They need to know that it has to change.

28:53.411 --> 28:56.864
And it can't just be brushed off anymore.

28:56.864 --> 28:58.524
- I had a chat with the team.

28:58.524 --> 29:00.256
They're not in a good place.

29:00.256 --> 29:01.791
And you've abused them.

29:01.791 --> 29:03.323
There are no boundaries.

29:03.323 --> 29:04.600
They're your staff.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.995
And they need to be treated a certain way.

29:07.995 --> 29:09.995
Let's go to Jamie first.

29:11.552 --> 29:13.692
I'm really concerned
about the abusive texts

29:13.692 --> 29:14.949
that you send him.

29:14.949 --> 29:16.586
Why would you send him abusive texts?

29:16.586 --> 29:18.043
- It's like you would send me a picture,

29:18.043 --> 29:19.225
like, "Oh, you forgot this,"

29:19.225 --> 29:20.631
or, "You didn't do this right."

29:20.631 --> 29:22.766
- You told me that you worked
at a lot of other places

29:22.766 --> 29:24.161
and you knew how to clean,

29:24.161 --> 29:25.855
and then the toilets
aren't cleaned and stuff.

29:25.855 --> 29:26.952
It's really important.

29:26.952 --> 29:28.466
- But some of that stuff doesn't work.

29:28.466 --> 29:30.024
So it's, like, I'm
sitting there scrubbing,

29:30.024 --> 29:32.128
and nothing's coming
up, and you'll be like,

29:32.128 --> 29:33.806
"Well, go do it again."

29:33.806 --> 29:37.196
And it's like, I'm
trying to do what I can.

29:37.196 --> 29:41.696
- None of these talented
individuals get paid on time.

29:42.538 --> 29:45.609
I want to know why they
don't get paid on time.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.930
- Because I don't have a payroll
system in place right now.

29:48.930 --> 29:51.612
- Well, that's a fucking disgrace.

29:51.612 --> 29:53.772
That is disgusting.

29:53.772 --> 29:55.861
And then you want them waiting on you

29:55.861 --> 29:57.939
up until all hours of the early morning

29:57.939 --> 30:00.180
while they tidy up after your crap

30:00.180 --> 30:05.180
and then you can't even be
bothered to pay them on time.

30:05.541 --> 30:06.574
- It's a mess.

30:06.574 --> 30:08.324
- No, you are a mess.

30:09.195 --> 30:11.308
- I need to say something, though.

30:11.308 --> 30:13.137
That almost every single person here,

30:13.137 --> 30:14.534
we've given them loans.

30:14.534 --> 30:16.181
- You're lending them
money to buy uniforms

30:16.181 --> 30:17.741
to work in your goddamn business.

30:17.741 --> 30:18.574
- Right.

30:18.574 --> 30:19.595
- [Gordon] That's absurd!

30:19.595 --> 30:20.553
- Why?

30:20.553 --> 30:21.386
- Why?

30:21.386 --> 30:23.039
- Absurd to pay for a uniform?

30:23.039 --> 30:25.421
- The business should be
providing the uniform.

30:25.421 --> 30:26.933
- Well, maybe we need to do that.

30:26.933 --> 30:27.766
- Yes, you do.

30:27.766 --> 30:29.008
- I never thought about it that way.

30:29.008 --> 30:30.910
- Whose business is this?

30:30.910 --> 30:32.472
(sighs)

30:32.472 --> 30:34.846
- I've tried to create
here a place where people

30:34.846 --> 30:39.596
can come and relax and escape
from their stressful lives.

30:42.009 --> 30:44.257
- Escape from their stressful lives,

30:44.257 --> 30:46.977
to hear you and Lisa scream at each other?

30:46.977 --> 30:49.927
Are you fucking kidding me?

30:49.927 --> 30:51.916
- We don't always scream at each other,

30:51.916 --> 30:53.300
but when we do...

30:53.300 --> 30:54.983
- Look how small this place is.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.559
You live here, so you've got no idea

30:56.559 --> 30:59.200
how many times you do it.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.896
The love, affection, and respect that

31:01.896 --> 31:04.311
they've shown you is extraordinary.

31:04.311 --> 31:08.144
And the sad news is you
both don't deserve it.

31:08.144 --> 31:10.855
(tense music)

31:10.855 --> 31:12.559
- I'm sorry.

31:12.559 --> 31:13.809
I will change.

31:13.809 --> 31:17.331
I just hope you guys wanna continue.

31:17.331 --> 31:22.331
- I just wanna say thank you
for your honesty, loyalty.

31:22.517 --> 31:24.207
There's some other important people

31:24.207 --> 31:25.643
that I want to introduce
you to this morning.

31:25.643 --> 31:26.726
Thank you.

31:26.726 --> 31:28.404
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

31:28.404 --> 31:29.791
- Thank you, guys.

31:29.791 --> 31:32.874
(slow melodic music)

31:37.317 --> 31:38.548
- Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

31:38.548 --> 31:39.381
- [All] Morning.

31:39.381 --> 31:40.525
- [Lisa] Good morning.

31:40.525 --> 31:44.741
- So, Lisa and Jonathan,
I've asked some ex-customers,

31:44.741 --> 31:48.530
locals, to come and
give you some feedback.

31:48.530 --> 31:50.682
Has anybody stayed there recently?

31:50.682 --> 31:51.515
- We did.

31:51.515 --> 31:55.469
The room we stayed in, it
had tools and screws...

31:55.469 --> 31:57.842
and instruction manuals.
- Light bulbs.

31:57.842 --> 31:59.055
- Wow.

31:59.055 --> 32:00.780
- So it's not just me.

32:00.780 --> 32:02.800
- For the air conditioners
and stuff, yeah.

32:02.800 --> 32:03.633
That's right.

32:03.633 --> 32:04.466
You're right.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.385
- Madame, give us an insight
to your experience, please.

32:06.385 --> 32:09.343
- I do have to say, my
husband ordered scallops,

32:09.343 --> 32:10.927
and they were raw.

32:10.927 --> 32:12.257
We returned them.

32:12.257 --> 32:15.756
The decor was very outdated,
and it feels very cluttered.

32:15.756 --> 32:17.612
You feel like you're locked in a closet.

32:17.612 --> 32:19.628
It's just overwhelming when you're trying

32:19.628 --> 32:20.687
to have a nice dinner.

32:20.687 --> 32:24.288
I would never come back
there if things don't change.

32:24.288 --> 32:25.314
- Okay.

32:25.314 --> 32:27.348
- What do you guys think
about the uniforms?

32:27.348 --> 32:28.322
- It's a bit much.

32:28.322 --> 32:30.962
- The poor ladies were kind of revealing.

32:30.962 --> 32:33.858
- Our server was the nicest person,

32:33.858 --> 32:36.219
but I think it takes a lot away from them.

32:36.219 --> 32:38.257
- It doesn't need to be in your face.

32:38.257 --> 32:41.163
- The reputation locally is crucial.

32:41.163 --> 32:42.556
What have you guys heard?

32:42.556 --> 32:45.928
- I've heard that it's
a swingers' hangout.

32:45.928 --> 32:47.726
- I heard that as well.

32:47.726 --> 32:50.366
When I had mentioned the Vienna, they say,

32:50.366 --> 32:53.106
"That's where the swingers go."

32:53.106 --> 32:56.667
You eat downstairs, and
then you go upstairs

32:56.667 --> 32:58.250
is what I was told.

32:59.897 --> 33:02.147
- [Gordon] But you've heard this before?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.861
- We've heard it for 13 years.

33:04.861 --> 33:06.958
- But is this due to
your late-night drinking

33:06.958 --> 33:07.890
and the partying?

33:07.890 --> 33:08.859
- I don't think so.

33:08.859 --> 33:10.405
- [Man] Fact or not, that's
how we see it, you know.

33:10.405 --> 33:12.012
- Yeah, cause you're living there.

33:12.012 --> 33:14.587
But what I'm trying to say is
that there are no boundaries.

33:14.587 --> 33:17.422
It's an oasis down there
that has got a Jacuzzi,

33:17.422 --> 33:20.309
a massage table, and if
the word has gotten out

33:20.309 --> 33:23.196
around town and then you're...

33:23.196 --> 33:25.016
- People misunderstood that room,

33:25.016 --> 33:26.264
and that's where it all started.

33:26.264 --> 33:29.431
- I'm just saying, it's either a business,

33:29.431 --> 33:30.721
or it's your home.

33:30.721 --> 33:32.304
There's no crossover.

33:32.304 --> 33:34.571
The mixed messages you're sending

33:34.571 --> 33:38.654
is your own fault 'cause
you haven't been clear.

33:39.568 --> 33:41.546
- I used to come to the restaurant

33:41.546 --> 33:43.417
probably every month or so,

33:43.417 --> 33:46.078
and I can tell you have a lot of, like,

33:46.078 --> 33:47.792
passion for your heritage,

33:47.792 --> 33:50.659
but it's not in the food anymore.

33:50.659 --> 33:53.582
If Gordon can help you take your heritage

33:53.582 --> 33:55.839
and the food and modernise it

33:55.839 --> 33:57.477
and you can progress with that,

33:57.477 --> 33:58.408
I'll come every Friday.

33:58.408 --> 33:59.241
Mark my words.

33:59.241 --> 34:00.824
It's a promise.

34:00.824 --> 34:03.864
- Do you have anything to say,
both of you, to these guests?

34:03.864 --> 34:07.590
- Thank you so much for
your honesty and input, and,

34:07.590 --> 34:09.367
really, really appreciate it.

34:09.367 --> 34:12.065
We're gonna be making some big changes

34:12.065 --> 34:16.143
to address many of the
things you talked about.

34:16.143 --> 34:19.032
- The staff have been incredibly loyal.

34:19.032 --> 34:20.572
They haven't been treated the way

34:20.572 --> 34:22.255
they should have been treated.

34:22.255 --> 34:24.277
I'm undecided about these two,

34:24.277 --> 34:26.136
but I am committed to that team,

34:26.136 --> 34:28.150
'cause I see what is at stake

34:28.150 --> 34:31.021
and the jeopardy they face going forward.

34:31.021 --> 34:35.603
Now I've got something
else important to sort out.

34:35.603 --> 34:38.187
(upbeat music)

34:39.800 --> 34:41.520
After leaving Jonathan and Lisa,

34:41.520 --> 34:44.735
I moved forward with my plans
to help renovate the inn.

34:44.735 --> 34:46.744
I brought in sommelier Dave Foss

34:46.744 --> 34:48.437
to create a beverage programme...

34:48.437 --> 34:49.882
Just have a look in here.

34:49.882 --> 34:50.715
I mean...

34:50.715 --> 34:51.994
- That wine's fantastic.

34:51.994 --> 34:54.300
- [Gordon] From the excessive
inventory they weren't using.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.132
- '03.

34:55.132 --> 34:56.480
Oh, that's delicious.

34:56.480 --> 34:58.438
- [Gordon] My team worked
up to the last minute

34:58.438 --> 35:01.661
transforming the many
spaces at the Vienna.

35:01.661 --> 35:02.673
- Wow.

35:02.673 --> 35:03.536
Oh-ho.

35:03.536 --> 35:04.369
- [Man] Wow.

35:04.369 --> 35:05.620
That is amazing.

35:05.620 --> 35:06.902
- Holy smokes.

35:06.902 --> 35:08.700
This is beautiful.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.064
This is incredible.

35:11.064 --> 35:12.314
Bravo.

35:12.314 --> 35:14.910
- The Vienna had no
organisation for managing

35:14.910 --> 35:16.810
their day-to-day operations.

35:16.810 --> 35:18.863
So I gave them a state-of-the-art system

35:18.863 --> 35:21.704
to help with all their
hotel operational needs.

35:21.704 --> 35:25.053
Welcome to the WebRezPro system.

35:25.053 --> 35:27.649
And this will help
transform your business.

35:27.649 --> 35:29.703
It will link up to the POS system,

35:29.703 --> 35:32.398
and it will give you data
like you've never had before.

35:32.398 --> 35:33.231
- Fabulous.

35:33.231 --> 35:36.828
- You need to be organised,
from the inventories

35:36.828 --> 35:39.537
to the wage costs to the salaries

35:39.537 --> 35:42.083
to the POS systems to the checking-in

35:42.083 --> 35:44.514
and the checking-out system.

35:44.514 --> 35:47.445
And the good news, guests
can now book online.

35:47.445 --> 35:50.695
So this should relieve a huge headache.

35:52.121 --> 35:54.052
I could see that everyone was thrilled

35:54.052 --> 35:55.668
with the changes at the Vienna.

35:55.668 --> 35:56.501
Good.

35:56.501 --> 35:57.455
Have a good look round.

35:57.455 --> 35:58.929
But as I watched Lisa...

35:58.929 --> 36:00.622
- Where's this stuff from?

36:00.622 --> 36:02.336
- [Gordon] I noticed she was dissatisfied

36:02.336 --> 36:03.657
with the renovations.

36:03.657 --> 36:05.142
- These are different
chairs from the other ones,

36:05.142 --> 36:06.475
aren't they?

36:06.475 --> 36:09.330
I was just seeing if it was 100% cotton.

36:09.330 --> 36:10.653
Is that a pull-out?

36:10.653 --> 36:12.758
- No, it doesn't need to be a pull-out.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.996
And right now I'm worried
where Lisa's head is,

36:15.996 --> 36:18.829
going into relaunch this evening.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.186
Good evening!
- Good evening.

36:27.186 --> 36:28.369
- I can help you with your bags.

36:28.369 --> 36:29.593
First let's get you checked in.

36:29.593 --> 36:30.652
- [Gordon] While it was time to relaunch

36:30.652 --> 36:31.875
the inn and restaurant...

36:31.875 --> 36:33.447
- Little more modern.

36:33.447 --> 36:34.510
- We have an order.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.945
- [Gordon] I provided the
staff with brand-new uniforms

36:36.945 --> 36:39.120
that go with the new updated menu

36:39.120 --> 36:42.004
that includes wine
pairing and beer flights.

36:42.004 --> 36:44.039
- First is going to be the grapefruit,

36:44.039 --> 36:46.245
then the second is
going to be the pilsner.

36:46.245 --> 36:47.398
- These are up here.

36:47.398 --> 36:49.101
- Please get out of here, Lisa.

36:49.101 --> 36:50.428
Off the line.

36:50.428 --> 36:53.178
- Shall I just turn this lamp on?

36:55.001 --> 36:56.345
No light bulb.

36:56.345 --> 36:57.412
(chuckles)

36:57.412 --> 36:58.245
Oops.

36:59.120 --> 37:00.001
Excuse me.

37:00.001 --> 37:01.215
- [Gordon] What's wrong?

37:01.215 --> 37:02.275
- No light bulb in there.

37:02.275 --> 37:03.450
I just wanna turn that light on.

37:03.450 --> 37:04.797
- Don't worry about it.

37:04.797 --> 37:06.460
Who's complaining about the light bulb?

37:06.460 --> 37:08.360
- Oh, just making sure that
they have enough light.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.413
Trying to turn it on,
then realised it later.

37:10.413 --> 37:11.381
- Doesn't matter.

37:11.381 --> 37:12.412
It doesn't matter.

37:12.412 --> 37:13.722
Let's focus on the big things.

37:13.722 --> 37:16.253
Are you always like this over
little details like that?

37:16.253 --> 37:18.888
- I like to have things
feel right, and so...

37:18.888 --> 37:21.056
I'm feeling extra, like, an extra need

37:21.056 --> 37:23.375
to make sure everything's
right, that's all.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.208
- OTT.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.103
- Just a fusser.

37:25.103 --> 37:26.061
- OTT.

37:26.061 --> 37:26.920
- Probably.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.079
Whatever that means.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.294
- Over the top.

37:29.294 --> 37:30.181
Over the top.

37:30.181 --> 37:31.200
- Well, I guess I don't have to be

37:31.200 --> 37:32.618
so over the top now, do I?

37:32.618 --> 37:34.213
- You do not.

37:34.213 --> 37:35.296
Jesus Christ.

37:41.181 --> 37:43.046
What is wrong with her tonight?

37:43.046 --> 37:44.129
Do you think she's gonna go back

37:44.129 --> 37:45.412
to her old ways when I leave?

37:45.412 --> 37:47.008
- [Melissa] She might accidentally.

37:47.008 --> 37:48.260
- Customer's coming.

37:48.260 --> 37:49.093
Welcome.

37:49.093 --> 37:51.787
While Lisa is nitpicking
everything unnecessarily...

37:51.787 --> 37:54.222
- [Jessica] Do you guys have
the appetiser for table five?

37:54.222 --> 37:55.055
- Oh, sorry.

37:55.055 --> 37:55.888
- [Jonathan] We didn't give you that yet?

37:55.888 --> 37:56.846
- [Jessica] No, you didn't.

37:56.846 --> 37:57.679
- No?

37:57.679 --> 37:58.512
- [Jessica] No.

37:58.512 --> 38:00.279
- [Gordon] Jonathan is
lost in the kitchen,

38:00.279 --> 38:02.744
and service is starting to suffer.

38:02.744 --> 38:04.563
What table number's this, please?

38:04.563 --> 38:05.746
- That is table number 11.

38:05.746 --> 38:06.998
They're waiting on two
flank steaks with it.

38:06.998 --> 38:08.412
- Where's the flank steak?

38:08.412 --> 38:09.370
Are they coming?

38:09.370 --> 38:10.203
- Moments.

38:10.203 --> 38:11.286
Moments.

38:11.286 --> 38:12.119
Minutes.

38:12.119 --> 38:13.310
- Who's cooking the flank steak?

38:13.310 --> 38:15.534
Come on, guys, we can do one
four-top at the same time, yes?

38:15.534 --> 38:17.935
I designed the menu around
the size of the kitchen,

38:17.935 --> 38:21.685
the speed of both you
working together, okay?

38:22.986 --> 38:24.734
Come back for the flank.

38:24.734 --> 38:26.223
- What the hell is this?

38:26.223 --> 38:28.009
- Look at me, both of you, both of you.

38:28.009 --> 38:29.501
Cut the shit, okay?

38:29.501 --> 38:30.334
Look at me.

38:30.334 --> 38:32.247
You're more than capable of
doing four fucking main courses

38:32.247 --> 38:33.428
at the same time,

38:33.428 --> 38:34.945
especially when there's two of you.

38:34.945 --> 38:37.064
And one of those main
courses is the same dish.

38:37.064 --> 38:38.317
We've gotta talk to each other,

38:38.317 --> 38:39.894
but I'm not gonna start
sending one dish at a time

38:39.894 --> 38:40.977
for a four-top.

38:40.977 --> 38:41.810
- Serious?

38:41.810 --> 38:42.643
- Doesn't matter.

38:42.643 --> 38:44.942
It doesn't matter at all.

38:44.942 --> 38:46.750
- Jonathan, hey, look at me.

38:46.750 --> 38:47.583
Look at me.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.132
I need some fucking effort
from you a little bit.

38:49.132 --> 38:50.239
I need a little bit of respect,

38:50.239 --> 38:51.631
a little bit of effort from you, okay?

38:51.631 --> 38:52.635
Yeah, and look at me.

38:52.635 --> 38:54.337
You're the man holding this
fucking thing together.

38:54.337 --> 38:56.678
If you go down, the whole
fucking place is gonna go down.

38:56.678 --> 38:58.275
I need you to step up, okay?

38:58.275 --> 38:59.593
I need you to talk a little bit.

38:59.593 --> 39:02.573
And I want four main courses
at the same fucking time.

39:02.573 --> 39:03.406
- Oh, dear God.

39:03.406 --> 39:04.239
- [Gordon] Jonathan.

39:04.239 --> 39:05.072
- Yes?

39:05.072 --> 39:06.780
- You can get your mind set
around four main courses

39:06.780 --> 39:07.863
at the same fucking time.

39:08.831 --> 39:11.857
(melodic music)

39:11.857 --> 39:13.991
Understand, we're serving
one table at a time,

39:13.991 --> 39:15.612
and we're gonna complete that table,

39:15.612 --> 39:18.203
four main courses, three main
courses, five main courses.

39:18.203 --> 39:19.323
We're gonna talk together.

39:19.323 --> 39:20.986
- Sausage goes with what, the two soups?

39:20.986 --> 39:22.340
- What's coming next?

39:22.340 --> 39:24.762
- It's gonna be sausage, two carrot soups,

39:24.762 --> 39:25.919
and a fried cheese.

39:25.919 --> 39:26.752
- Good.

39:26.752 --> 39:27.748
- For table seven.

39:27.748 --> 39:28.955
- Okay, so we're talking now.

39:28.955 --> 39:29.824
- Yep.
- Good.

39:29.824 --> 39:30.657
- Carrot?

39:30.657 --> 39:31.763
- Thank you very much.

39:31.763 --> 39:33.188
- I have your flank steaks.

39:33.188 --> 39:35.354
Your wine is coming right away, okay?

39:35.354 --> 39:36.935
- Your sausage.

39:36.935 --> 39:38.519
You guys are all sharing, right?

39:38.519 --> 39:39.504
- Yes.
- Yeah.

39:39.504 --> 39:41.210
- [Jessica] I think the
new Vienna will definitely

39:41.210 --> 39:43.080
attract a younger crowd.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.222
- Oh, my God.

39:44.222 --> 39:45.484
- So beautiful.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.793
- I'm super excited about the new changes,

39:47.793 --> 39:49.779
and I hope they'll last.

39:49.779 --> 39:50.779
I really do.

39:52.468 --> 39:53.381
- Right.

39:53.381 --> 39:57.696
We've had ups and downs, but
tonight is a prime example

39:57.696 --> 40:01.635
of how good and how profitable
this business can be.

40:01.635 --> 40:03.109
Customers loving the food.

40:03.109 --> 40:04.431
They love the decor.

40:04.431 --> 40:06.198
I'm leaving you with all the tools

40:06.198 --> 40:08.940
to get this place back to
where you want it to go.

40:08.940 --> 40:10.434
I do wanna ask you one thing.

40:10.434 --> 40:11.267
- Sure.

40:11.267 --> 40:12.934
- Is there anything
that's happened this week

40:12.934 --> 40:14.362
that you're not happy with?

40:14.362 --> 40:16.362
- Yes, I had expected the
Blumen's room to be done,

40:16.362 --> 40:17.388
not the Koenig.

40:17.388 --> 40:19.757
It was the room I didn't expect.

40:19.757 --> 40:22.024
- And the room that we've done-

40:22.024 --> 40:23.612
- Is amazing.
- Still has problems.

40:23.612 --> 40:25.746
- Can I just tell you
something really important?

40:25.746 --> 40:27.702
This is not a makeover show.

40:27.702 --> 40:29.068
- I know that.
- Yeah.

40:29.068 --> 40:30.796
- But you're complaining about-

40:30.796 --> 40:32.412
- I wasn't saying I didn't love that room.

40:32.412 --> 40:34.471
- It'd be a great shame for
you to sound ungrateful.

40:34.471 --> 40:35.890
- Oh, I'm not ungrateful.

40:35.890 --> 40:36.938
I am just so shocked-

40:36.938 --> 40:39.744
- From the new management system to Dave,

40:39.744 --> 40:40.775
you've got no idea-

40:40.775 --> 40:42.481
- I'm coming across wrong if you think

40:42.481 --> 40:45.084
that I'm being ungrateful,
'cause I'm really not.

40:45.084 --> 40:46.737
- It sounds like that.

40:46.737 --> 40:47.729
- No.

40:47.729 --> 40:48.692
Not at all.

40:48.692 --> 40:50.218
- I can't come in and wave a magic wand

40:50.218 --> 40:51.781
and transform 15 bedrooms

40:51.781 --> 40:53.153
and put a brand-new kitchen.

40:53.153 --> 40:55.203
You now know what needs to happen.

40:55.203 --> 40:56.036
- I do.

40:56.036 --> 40:57.498
- But I need to tell you something

40:57.498 --> 40:58.904
that you're not gonna like.

40:58.904 --> 41:01.010
I arranged for a new stove...

41:01.010 --> 41:01.993
- You did?

41:01.993 --> 41:04.603
- To come, and then
when I got the engineer

41:04.603 --> 41:07.397
to come and survey the
place, unfortunately,

41:07.397 --> 41:10.985
he had to leave, because he
was gonna shut the place down,

41:10.985 --> 41:13.436
'cause there's practises that
are taking place in there

41:13.436 --> 41:14.791
that aren't appropriate.

41:14.791 --> 41:16.743
- You're saying the gas systems or...

41:16.743 --> 41:18.398
- The whole setup underneath there.

41:18.398 --> 41:20.248
Nothing's been changed in 13 years.

41:20.248 --> 41:23.862
And it's on the verge
of running illegally.

41:23.862 --> 41:26.000
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.206
- Listen, I came here to help,

41:28.206 --> 41:30.192
but you need to help yourselves

41:30.192 --> 41:33.789
and dig deep and stick together, okay?

41:33.789 --> 41:35.004
Thank you.

41:35.004 --> 41:36.003
- Thank you.

41:36.003 --> 41:36.935
- Good luck.

41:36.935 --> 41:38.384
- Okay.
- Thank you, Gordon.

41:38.384 --> 41:39.217
- Okay.

41:39.217 --> 41:40.050
Good night.

41:40.050 --> 41:41.633
- Thank you.

41:41.633 --> 41:44.210
Auf wiedersehen.
- Safe travelling.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.579
(exhales deeply)

41:45.579 --> 41:47.579
- Man, that's hard work.

41:54.153 --> 41:55.782
(upbeat music)

41:55.782 --> 41:58.490
Soon after I left, Lisa
and Jonathan reverted

41:58.490 --> 41:59.775
to the old Vienna...

41:59.775 --> 42:02.044
- [Lisa] This is something
that belongs here.

42:02.044 --> 42:03.930
That came with the house.

42:03.930 --> 42:05.540
- What are you doing?

42:05.540 --> 42:06.616
You're insane.

42:06.616 --> 42:08.227
- [Gordon] By changing the decor

42:08.227 --> 42:10.034
and bringing back the original menu.

42:10.034 --> 42:11.399
- It's worse than it was.

42:11.399 --> 42:12.516
It looks horrible.

42:12.516 --> 42:14.051
- [Gordon] They chose
not to take my advice

42:14.051 --> 42:15.459
about running the inn properly...

42:15.459 --> 42:16.661
- [Lisa] Listen to me about what should be

42:16.661 --> 42:17.914
going on in the kitchen.

42:17.914 --> 42:18.953
- [Gordon] And as a result,

42:18.953 --> 42:22.453
their reputation in town remains the same.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.657
- [Announcer] One potato, two potato.
