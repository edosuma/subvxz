00:42.877 --> 00:48.174
They're memories that have
persisted for 30 million years.

00:48.383 --> 00:52.303
Memories of when
people's feelings transcended time

00:52.512 --> 01:00.770
amid its ceaseless,
never-reversing, never-crossing flow.

01:00.979 --> 01:05.942
Memories of when people's feelings
arrived at the gates of fate.

01:12.532 --> 01:14.033
A dream...?

01:42.270 --> 01:46.983
<i>intertwined threads grate against each other</i>

01:47.192 --> 01:53.281
<i>and overwrite their contradictory scenes</i>

01:53.490 --> 01:58.328
<i>The irrationality leads to several crossed lines</i>

01:58.536 --> 02:04.083
<i>that nullify love and even the future</i>

02:05.210 --> 02:10.924
<i>All of the irreplaceable
connections and attachments</i>

02:11.132 --> 02:16.262
<i>that come to mind with each new scene</i>

02:16.471 --> 02:27.690
<i>are imprinted on these bright, dazzling badges</i>

02:28.858 --> 02:30.068
<i>I believe it.</i>

02:30.276 --> 02:35.740
<i>The world flies away, and as the end begins</i>

02:35.949 --> 02:41.329
<i>it engulfs the inconvenient future</i>

02:41.538 --> 02:47.043
<i>Wracked by the déjé vu of utter loneliness</i>

02:47.252 --> 02:52.590
<i>the circuits are eventually cut</i>

02:52.799 --> 02:58.263
<i>With 1s replaced by Os,
and with perceptions shifted,</i>

02:58.471 --> 03:04.519
<i>what do your eyes see now?</i>

03:15.154 --> 03:17.323
Hey, you there.

03:17.532 --> 03:19.242
Can you see us?

03:19.450 --> 03:20.910
Why won't you answer?

03:21.119 --> 03:23.329
--I'm talking to you, the stupid-face
on the other side of the screen!

03:24.956 --> 03:26.457
Call me Mayushii!

03:26.666 --> 03:29.377
Lab Member 003, the super haxOr.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.129
Do you have anything to add?

03:31.337 --> 03:34.257
It's "hacker," not "hax0r," nOOb.

03:34.465 --> 03:37.051
He never says anything, does he?

03:37.260 --> 03:39.137
But there has been a development.

03:39.345 --> 03:42.223
Thanks to our constant,
year-long inquisitiveness...

03:42.432 --> 03:46.394
...he's finally produced offspring!

03:46.603 --> 03:47.937
How cute!

03:48.146 --> 03:49.731
Real-lifer. GTFO.

03:49.939 --> 03:53.359
It's indeed clear that
this game contains a secret code

03:53.568 --> 03:57.739
that will reconstruct
the world's ruling structure.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.074
<i>I will</i> expose it!

04:00.283 --> 04:03.369
I, Hououin Kyouma, swear it!

04:03.578 --> 04:05.705
Do you want some barley tea, Daru-kun?

04:05.914 --> 04:07.415
Oh. Yes, plz.

04:07.624 --> 04:08.958
Mayushii, Mayushii.

04:09.167 --> 04:11.961
When you offer tea, you should say, "T4U."

04:12.170 --> 04:13.379
IIT4U I'?

04:13.588 --> 04:16.673
Yeah. As in, "Here's some
tea for you if you'd like."

04:16.882 --> 04:19.052
How about you, Okarin?

04:19.260 --> 04:23.222
Do you honestly believe I'd drink
a plebian beverage such as tea?

04:23.431 --> 04:26.351
<i>I</i> drink the intelligent drink
of choice individuals!

04:26.559 --> 04:28.311
Dk Pepper, right?

04:29.604 --> 04:34.108
Mayuri. Activate Future Gadget #10:
Cool Visitor, if you would!

04:34.317 --> 04:35.526
What?

04:35.735 --> 04:39.322
But this doesn't cool the air very much...

04:39.530 --> 04:41.324
Fear not.

04:41.532 --> 04:44.452
It's been half a day since
we halted continuous operation.

04:44.661 --> 04:47.413
It's filled with plenty of chilly air.

04:47.622 --> 04:49.499
Are you sure?

04:51.459 --> 04:53.336
See? Pleasant, isn't it?

04:53.544 --> 04:55.838
It doesn't feel much different
from an ordinary fan.

04:56.047 --> 05:00.635
If anything, the motor gives off
more heat than it gives off cool air.

05:00.843 --> 05:03.763
The tea isn't very cold anymore, either.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.348
SHence!

05:05.556 --> 05:07.976
This new invention goes far beyond--

05:10.687 --> 05:16.234
Shutting down like that
is bad news for save files...

05:17.568 --> 05:19.153
<i>You“).!</i>

05:20.488 --> 05:22.615
If I lost my save
with every portrait unlocked,

05:22.824 --> 05:24.659
I'm gonna kill you and then kill myself!

05:24.867 --> 05:26.619
--Tears...?
--Okabe!

05:26.828 --> 05:29.455
--Crap!
--Get your ass down here!

05:29.664 --> 05:33.751
If you need to see me, logic dictates
that you come up here, Mr. Brown.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.587
Shut up! I'll raise your rent by 5,000 yen!

05:36.796 --> 05:37.922
I'll be right there!

05:38.131 --> 05:40.091
Oh! Nae-chan!

05:40.299 --> 05:43.219
Big Sis Mayuri!

05:44.345 --> 05:46.889
Summer, 2010...

05:47.098 --> 05:49.475
A year has passed since I reached
the Steins Gate world line.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.689
In this world,
Mayuri doesn't end up dead...

05:54.897 --> 05:57.483
...Kurisu doesn't get murdered...

05:57.692 --> 06:01.904
...and time machines
and D-mails never exist.

06:02.113 --> 06:05.074
Time marches forward here

06:05.283 --> 06:09.287
with no reversions and no revisions,

06:09.495 --> 06:13.624
free from any other world lines.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.251
Mayuri?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.484
Okarin!

06:41.069 --> 06:42.445
ls something the matter?

06:42.653 --> 06:44.530
No...

06:44.739 --> 06:46.991
Say, Okarin.

06:47.200 --> 06:48.951
Are you really okay?

06:49.160 --> 06:52.371
Yes. I have a mission I must complete.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.958
The survival of the
Future Gadget Laboratory depends on it.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.336
--A dangerous mission
given to me by Mr. Brown--

06:59.545 --> 07:02.924
Then I should be going.
Ruka-kun is waiting.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.390
Welcome back.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.351
Are you on summer holiday?

07:13.559 --> 07:15.853
Not your business.

07:16.813 --> 07:19.023
Where is she? Where is she?

07:19.232 --> 07:22.443
Her plane landed a while ago.
She should be here any minute now.

07:22.652 --> 07:24.070
Oh!

07:28.116 --> 07:29.826
Ku risu-chan!

07:30.034 --> 07:32.829
Welcome back!

07:33.037 --> 07:36.082
Mayuri! You came all this way for me?!

07:36.290 --> 07:37.041
Mm!

07:37.250 --> 07:40.920
I just couldn't wait!

07:41.129 --> 07:42.839
It's good to see you again.

07:43.047 --> 07:44.590
It's been a while!

07:44.799 --> 07:46.759
Urushibara-san, right?

07:46.968 --> 07:48.427
Yes!

07:48.636 --> 07:50.388
But he's a dude.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.266
You can stop by the lab, right?

07:54.267 --> 07:57.603
O-Of course. It's still early
in the day and all.

07:58.771 --> 07:59.480
Wow.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.399
The station's changed a lot, too.

08:01.607 --> 08:06.195
Yeah. There's a brand-new
Gunbam café and an idol shop!

08:06.404 --> 08:09.198
Even the Radio Building was rebuilt!

08:09.407 --> 08:11.367
So much can change in one year.

08:11.576 --> 08:13.494
What about the lab?

08:13.703 --> 08:16.873
Nothing much has changed, I guess.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.040
But guess what!

08:18.249 --> 08:21.085
Daru-kun made a friend!

08:21.294 --> 08:22.295
A girl friend!

08:22.503 --> 08:23.296
No way!

08:23.504 --> 08:24.839
She's a cosplayer.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.968
Amane... Yuki-san, was it?

08:29.177 --> 08:32.638
Yes. I hear they met online.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.932
She's really cute, too.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.976
Cute...?

08:37.184 --> 08:38.269
This is her!

08:38.477 --> 08:40.938
Wait, is Hashida's family
rich or something?

08:41.147 --> 08:42.982
No, I don't think so.

08:43.191 --> 08:45.443
Then did he win the lottery or something?

08:45.651 --> 08:47.945
I haven't heard anything like that, either.

08:48.154 --> 08:49.822
--Then he must be--
--Oh!

08:50.031 --> 08:51.449
There's Daru-kun!

08:51.657 --> 08:52.992
Daru-kun!

08:53.201 --> 08:54.243
Oh! Mayush--

08:54.452 --> 08:55.453
Whoa, Ms. Makise!

08:55.661 --> 08:57.997
--Long time--
--You're tricking her! Just admit it!

08:58.206 --> 09:00.666
Huh? What are you talking about?

09:03.628 --> 09:06.297
Daru-kun is tricking her?

09:06.505 --> 09:09.050
I don't think he is...

09:09.258 --> 09:12.595
He even said they
exchanged photos the other day.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.513
What photo did you send her?

09:14.722 --> 09:16.766
Err, well...

09:18.184 --> 09:19.685
Adobe® Photoshop®, huh?

09:19.894 --> 09:24.649
Yes, this is the only way a girl
would ever get close to a pervert like you.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.984
That's cruel! It's not nice to judge!

09:27.193 --> 09:32.114
But she said she likes
bear-like guys, didn't she?

09:32.323 --> 09:33.115
Mm.

09:33.324 --> 09:37.912
When a girl says, "l love bear-like people!"
she's not saying, "Fatties OK."

09:38.120 --> 09:40.331
Whoa, you scare me.

09:46.504 --> 09:48.839
I see the place is as messy as ever.

09:49.048 --> 09:50.383
Ku risu-chan!

09:50.591 --> 09:51.926
T4u!

09:52.134 --> 09:53.636
<i>Th,“!</i>

09:55.054 --> 09:57.348
Still talk like an @channe|er, I see.

09:57.556 --> 09:58.933
Shut up!

09:59.141 --> 10:01.560
Still, Okarin's really late.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.146
He said he was going to
Ame-Yoko to buy something

10:04.355 --> 10:06.482
right after his errand for Mr. Brown.

10:06.691 --> 10:08.859
What a shame. Ms. Makise is here and all...

10:09.068 --> 10:10.861
I-It's fine!

10:17.368 --> 10:19.412
Are you all right, Kurisu-chan?

10:19.620 --> 10:21.747
L-I 'm okay, Mayuri!

10:21.956 --> 10:25.084
<i>In fact, I'm relieved he's not here!</i>

10:25.293 --> 10:27.586
Now I don't have to
waste energy dealing with him.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.755
<i>A template tsundere, FTW.</i>

10:29.964 --> 10:31.757
lam nothing of the sort!

10:31.966 --> 10:34.218
Curse that Mr. Brown.

10:34.427 --> 10:37.555
Sending me to that lousy,
far-flung parts shop...

10:46.397 --> 10:48.357
It's me! Yes, that's right!

10:48.566 --> 10:51.569
The Organization has sent
yet another agent!

10:51.777 --> 10:54.822
What?! An emergency request?!

10:55.031 --> 10:56.365
Yes! All right!

10:56.574 --> 10:59.785
If that's the choice of Steins Gate!

10:59.994 --> 11:02.079
El Psy Congroo.

11:02.288 --> 11:04.457
He's still as obnoxious as ever.

11:04.665 --> 11:05.666
Sorry.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.585
Long time, no see, Assistant.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.587
I mean, Christina.

11:09.795 --> 11:13.132
I mean, experiment-loving pervert girl...

11:13.341 --> 11:15.009
...or "pervert" for short!

11:15.217 --> 11:18.471
It's possible to be too rude!
And that isn't an abbreviation!

11:18.679 --> 11:19.847
From your reaction,

11:20.056 --> 11:22.767
it would seem you're indeed
the bona fide Christina...

11:22.975 --> 11:24.226
...Christina!

11:24.435 --> 11:26.604
Quit it with the "tina" already!

11:26.812 --> 11:28.606
Still, Hisstina!

11:28.814 --> 11:32.443
The Future Gadget Laboratory
is home to a clandestine organization.

11:32.651 --> 11:36.781
It goes without saying that you
need proper authorization to enter.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.032
Remember that.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.909
I'm a member of this lab.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.995
I have the right to come and go as I please.

11:43.204 --> 11:46.457
You're absent from the lab for
nearly a year, yet claim you have rights?

11:46.665 --> 11:51.253
--And you call yourself my assistant?!
--It's like the good old lab is back.

11:51.462 --> 11:54.715
--I'm not your assistant or Christina!
--Yes! I'm very happy!

11:54.924 --> 11:59.428
--You're right. You're actually an
experiment-loving, perverted genius girl.
--No!

11:59.637 --> 12:02.264
Why have you come to Japan, pervert girl?

12:02.473 --> 12:04.433
Are you here to apologize
for ditching the lab?

12:04.642 --> 12:07.269
Why should I have to
apologize for anything?!

12:07.478 --> 12:10.564
I only stopped by because
there's a conference in Japan!

12:10.773 --> 12:13.359
Plus, I missed Mayuri!

12:13.567 --> 12:15.111
Here! A souvenir!

12:15.319 --> 12:16.862
Oh! Really?!

12:17.071 --> 12:19.073
Thank you!

12:19.281 --> 12:21.659
It's a sewing set I found overseas.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.744
For you too, Urushibara-san!

12:23.953 --> 12:25.121
Thank you!

12:25.329 --> 12:28.874
Did you get an uncensored
North American version of something for me?

12:29.083 --> 12:31.502
That'd get you arrested at customs.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.796
I have nothing for you guys.

12:34.004 --> 12:37.258
I only came to see them, after all.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.680
I never hoped for anything
from the very start!

12:42.888 --> 12:47.101
Now, begone from here at once!

12:47.309 --> 12:49.687
You don't need to tell me! I <i>will</i> "begone"!

12:49.895 --> 12:51.522
I need to check in to my hotel anyway.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.275
Aww! You're leaving already?

12:54.483 --> 12:58.612
I'm in Japan for a little while.
I'll get in touch again.

12:59.738 --> 13:03.367
Kyouma! We're here, meow!

13:03.576 --> 13:05.119
Sorry... to disturb you.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.329
Faris-chan and Moeka-san!

13:07.538 --> 13:08.706
What are you doing here?

13:08.914 --> 13:11.500
Huh? Aren't we having
a barbecue, meow?

13:11.709 --> 13:13.794
Kyouma came by and told us, meow!

13:14.003 --> 13:19.508
He said we should have a barbecue
today because you're visiting!

13:19.717 --> 13:21.510
He... e-mailed me.

13:21.719 --> 13:22.970
--Okarin...
--What?!

13:23.179 --> 13:25.973
Increased solar storm activity
is producing auditory hallucinations

13:26.182 --> 13:29.351
and highly improbable
communications signals all over?!

13:29.560 --> 13:30.394
Oh, no!

13:30.603 --> 13:33.522
Don't tell me the Seven Sages
of Seiryuzan have taken action, meow?!

13:33.731 --> 13:35.357
Absolutely inexcusable!

13:35.566 --> 13:38.068
--Forget apologies! I demand--!
--Calm down.

13:38.277 --> 13:41.071
Having all the lab members gather like this

13:41.280 --> 13:43.407
must be the choice of Steins Gate.

13:43.616 --> 13:45.659
Mayuri! Ready a round table meeting!

13:45.868 --> 13:46.702
Right!

13:46.911 --> 13:47.745
Rukako.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.288
Y-Yes?!

13:49.497 --> 13:52.374
You've forgotten the code phrase.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.002
E-El... Psy...

13:55.211 --> 13:56.170
...Congree?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.547
It's "Congroo," Ruka-kun!

13:58.756 --> 14:00.549
Kurisu-chan! You have time, right?!

14:00.758 --> 14:01.842
l-l suppose.

14:02.051 --> 14:04.053
No more tsundere, okay?

14:04.261 --> 14:05.846
You too, Okarin!

14:06.055 --> 14:07.431
Sheesh...

14:07.640 --> 14:10.142
He just always has to hide his feelings.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.609
--Mixy, mixy! Mixy, mixy!
--Woot!

14:18.817 --> 14:22.404
Eye Contact Mixy-Mixy Yakisoba!

14:22.613 --> 14:24.406
--Mixy, mixy!
--Oh, you pain me so, Faris-tan!

14:24.615 --> 14:26.825
Oh, I think that might be
a little undercooked...

14:27.034 --> 14:28.661
That's all right.

14:28.869 --> 14:32.873
Oh, I want to die this instant!
And let this feeling last forever...!

14:33.082 --> 14:35.125
It was undercooked.

14:40.798 --> 14:42.258
The next one was okay!

14:42.466 --> 14:45.844
Oh! You can eat green peppers, Nae-chan!

14:46.053 --> 14:46.929
I'm impressed!

14:47.137 --> 14:50.015
Yeah! But my dad won't eat them at all!

14:50.224 --> 14:52.560
One year, huh...

14:59.650 --> 15:02.027
What... was that?

15:02.236 --> 15:04.613
Okabe!

15:04.822 --> 15:06.031
What is it, Christi--

15:06.240 --> 15:08.867
I just can't accept it, however I look at it!

15:09.076 --> 15:10.327
What are you talking about?

15:10.536 --> 15:12.079
Time machines!

15:12.288 --> 15:16.875
--They're theoretically impossible!
--You're too close!

15:17.084 --> 15:19.128
Wait, are you...?!

15:19.336 --> 15:22.172
But we only brought non-alcoholic beer--

15:22.381 --> 15:23.799
Huh?

15:27.636 --> 15:30.806
Now this is a beer!

15:31.890 --> 15:33.100
Hey, are you listening to me?

15:33.309 --> 15:36.312
--A-About what?
--About what you said before.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.897
You told me about it
when you came to America!

15:39.106 --> 15:43.277
Other world lines and stuff
that happened to other versions of me...

15:43.485 --> 15:50.075
And then, while I was so
confused by it all, you went and...

15:50.284 --> 15:53.329
I went and...?

15:54.288 --> 15:58.125
W-W-Wait! You're going to
bring that up here?! Now?!

15:58.334 --> 16:00.252
What?

16:00.461 --> 16:02.046
So it's really that embarrassing for you?

16:02.254 --> 16:03.922
Oh, err, uhh...!

16:04.131 --> 16:07.343
To be honest, it made me feel...

16:07.551 --> 16:08.677
It made me feel...

16:08.886 --> 16:10.220
H-Hey!

16:10.429 --> 16:11.555
ls something the matter, meow?

16:11.764 --> 16:12.681
Wha...?! No.,,!

16:12.890 --> 16:16.727
My special End-of-the-Century
Yakisoba is almost ready, meow!

16:16.935 --> 16:21.273
This guy never sent me
a single e-mail since last summer!

16:21.482 --> 16:25.319
Even after what he did--
and saying that he loves me--

16:25.527 --> 16:27.863
now he's blaming it on other world lines»!

16:29.782 --> 16:32.534
Knock it off! Come with me!

16:33.744 --> 16:36.497
Let go! Let go of me!

16:38.374 --> 16:40.209
Whoa, watch it!

16:41.210 --> 16:42.378
Okabe...

16:42.586 --> 16:44.797
Y-Yeah...?

16:45.005 --> 16:46.465
Hold me.

16:50.386 --> 16:52.471
Wh-What are y--

16:52.680 --> 16:54.264
Wham?

16:56.767 --> 16:57.559
Rub, rub!

16:57.768 --> 17:00.854
--Wh-Whoa! Hold on!
--Rub, rub!

17:01.063 --> 17:02.564
It feels prickly...

17:03.649 --> 17:04.775
What if someone shows up?!

17:04.983 --> 17:06.109
--That a problem?
--Huh?!

17:06.318 --> 17:07.778
Don't want anyone to see, huh?

17:07.986 --> 17:10.114
N-No, it's not like that--

17:10.321 --> 17:11.615
Then you're okay with it!

17:11.824 --> 17:13.325
N-No, I don't think it's--!

17:13.534 --> 17:14.617
Which is it?!

17:14.827 --> 17:17.496
Which one is your so-called
"choice of Steins Gate"?!

17:17.704 --> 17:19.123
Err, what I mean is...!

17:19.330 --> 17:21.625
Make up your mind already!

17:22.459 --> 17:23.877
Whoa! Wait!

17:35.431 --> 17:36.890
Here, Assistant.

17:37.099 --> 17:39.143
Use this to cool your head.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.353
Th-Thanks.

17:41.562 --> 17:42.438
You're unbelievable.

17:42.646 --> 17:44.606
What do you mean by that?

17:44.815 --> 17:47.067
Are you <i>still</i> gonna bicker with me?

17:48.777 --> 17:52.072
I'm the one who should say
you're unbelievable.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.782
I'm a scientist.

17:53.991 --> 17:58.871
I refuse to believe in things like
past-life encounters and fate.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.999
Not to mention world lines
and time machines.

18:02.207 --> 18:02.916
I know.

18:03.125 --> 18:06.420
Even so, however hard I try
to deny it with logic,

18:06.628 --> 18:09.214
there's still something about it all...

18:09.423 --> 18:12.384
Something that gets my head all mixed up.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.929
Oh, this is just...!

18:19.057 --> 18:21.226
A spoon and a fork?

18:21.435 --> 18:24.480
You wanted some before, remember?

18:25.773 --> 18:28.859
Oh, right. I did...

18:29.067 --> 18:32.029
But I've never told you about that.

18:32.237 --> 18:36.116
Oh, yeah. On this world line...

18:36.325 --> 18:41.622
It almost feels like
you're peeking into my mind.

18:41.830 --> 18:43.499
Sorry. I'm going to rest a bit.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.417
M-Mm.

18:53.175 --> 18:53.967
Oh!

18:54.176 --> 18:57.471
You're going to miss out
on the yakisoba, Okarin!

18:57.679 --> 18:59.389
O-Oh, right.

19:00.682 --> 19:03.602
Hey, Mayuri.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.104
I told you before, right?

19:06.313 --> 19:09.691
About how I traveled across
other world lines to get here...

19:09.900 --> 19:11.026
Yeah.

19:11.235 --> 19:15.531
And you were with other Mayushiis
and Kurisu-chans, right?

19:15.739 --> 19:18.075
What's your opinion of that?

19:18.283 --> 19:19.451
Why do you ask?

19:19.660 --> 19:22.621
It's Kurisu, you see...

19:24.122 --> 19:31.463
I don't think you're lying,
so it's probably true!

19:31.672 --> 19:37.094
But that might be because
I don't understand complicated stuff,

19:37.302 --> 19:45.561
but Kurisu-chan is smart and is
thinking hard about what you're saying.

19:45.769 --> 19:48.438
Well, I'll be on the roof!

19:50.315 --> 19:52.776
Time machines can't be...

19:59.783 --> 20:00.784
What is this?!

20:00.993 --> 20:02.411
Mayuri!

20:11.461 --> 20:12.713
Okarin.

20:12.921 --> 20:16.216
Do you know where
we put the new dishcloth?

20:16.425 --> 20:19.011
If it's not on the top shelf, then...

20:19.219 --> 20:21.096
Was it under the stove?

20:21.305 --> 20:24.725
Here you are, New Mr. Dishcloth!

20:24.933 --> 20:27.019
What's the matter, Okarin?

20:27.227 --> 20:28.729
This is...

20:35.903 --> 20:38.989
Eating outside sure is fun,
even on top of the lab!

20:39.197 --> 20:39.990
Yeah!

20:40.198 --> 20:43.160
I feel all the feels
having a barbecue with Faris-tan!

20:43.368 --> 20:44.620
“Mayuri!
--What?!

20:44.828 --> 20:46.246
--Come with me!
--Okarin! What's wrong?!

20:46.455 --> 20:47.623
Get up, Kurisu!

20:47.831 --> 20:50.083
--Hurry!
--What's going on?

20:50.292 --> 20:51.877
Just hurry!

20:55.005 --> 20:57.090
Okabe! What in the world-f?!

20:57.299 --> 20:58.926
Quiet...

21:01.219 --> 21:03.805
Hey, guys. You forgot this on the roof--

21:04.014 --> 21:05.474
Don't move!

21:05.682 --> 21:08.310
Wh-What is this, Okabe?! Why are you--?

21:08.518 --> 21:11.188
Kurisu! Hurry and start
the time leap machine!

21:11.396 --> 21:12.814
There's no time! Hurry!

21:13.023 --> 21:15.859
Calm down, Okabe! There is no such thing!

21:16.068 --> 21:17.444
Don't be stupid!

21:17.653 --> 21:19.780
It's sitting right there on the--!

21:29.289 --> 21:32.250
This is... the Steins Gate world line?

21:32.459 --> 21:33.543
H-Huh?

21:33.752 --> 21:34.711
Steins...?

21:34.920 --> 21:38.507
That's right! You told me about it before!

21:38.715 --> 21:41.551
This is the world line you finally reached!

21:43.971 --> 21:45.347
Oh...

21:45.555 --> 21:47.557
I'm sorry.

21:52.813 --> 21:55.148
What the hell was that?

22:01.238 --> 22:05.450
What was that I just saw?

22:05.659 --> 22:08.745
A dream? A delusion?

22:08.954 --> 22:12.916
No. It was definitely real!

22:13.125 --> 22:15.669
I was on a different world line.

22:15.877 --> 22:20.716
I haven't used any D-mails
or time machines, though...

22:20.924 --> 22:22.509
No! Think calmly!

22:22.718 --> 22:24.302
It's just not possible!

22:24.511 --> 22:26.930
It was a delusion! A daydream!

22:27.139 --> 22:32.185
My memories from other world lines
are simply making it seem real--

22:33.270 --> 22:35.397
This is a nice view!

22:35.605 --> 22:40.110
I guess humans need
times like this too on occasion!

22:40.318 --> 22:44.698
I'd rather be working on
the time leap machine.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.783
I'm so hot...

22:46.992 --> 22:49.745
How did I get myself into this?

22:49.953 --> 22:56.251
Oh, Daru-kun. You really should
exercise more. You're overweight.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.961
What is this place?

22:58.170 --> 23:00.547
Talk about pathetic.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.507
You'll never survive like that.

23:02.716 --> 23:04.134
Suzuha“.

23:05.677 --> 23:07.429
You're going 150 Pa)!-

23:07.637 --> 23:09.639
You're all going to pay for driving my dad...

23:09.848 --> 23:11.516
--FB! FB! FB! FB!
--...to his death.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.143
Stop...

23:14.478 --> 23:17.814
Stop!

23:23.695 --> 23:26.573
Now they're... lasting longer?

23:26.782 --> 23:28.325
Okarin.

23:33.205 --> 23:33.997
Mayuri...

23:34.206 --> 23:36.458
Are you okay?

23:36.666 --> 23:39.503
Y-Yes! I'm fine!

23:39.711 --> 23:41.755
Sorry about earlier.

23:41.963 --> 23:47.135
My right arm decided
to run amok on its own, you see.

23:47.344 --> 23:51.139
It's all right. It was a little scary, though.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.642
You're sweating so much!

23:55.811 --> 23:57.020
Sorry to bother you...

23:57.229 --> 24:02.901
No, it's okay. This is all I can really do.

24:04.778 --> 24:07.781
I've had this dream lately.

24:07.989 --> 24:13.745
In it, you keep saving me. Over and over.

24:13.954 --> 24:19.709
I always end up making you look sad...

24:19.918 --> 24:21.545
Mayuri.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.216
It's just a dream.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.176
Okarin...

24:28.385 --> 24:33.056
--It's a dream. Nothing more.
--Mm. You're right.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.311
--Let's go.
--Mm.

24:39.813 --> 24:43.733
You held me like this then too.

24:43.942 --> 24:46.778
Thanks, Okarin.

25:06.423 --> 25:08.175
Excuse me!

25:15.891 --> 25:17.392
Good morning, Faris-chan!

25:17.601 --> 25:19.853
Good meowning!

25:21.438 --> 25:22.606
How does it look?

25:22.814 --> 25:25.692
B-Bad, Sir.

25:25.901 --> 25:27.611
It's no good?

25:28.612 --> 25:34.618
This month's utility bill alone
puts us 28,568 yen in the red.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.456
Maybe I seriously should raise their rent!

25:58.934 --> 26:00.936
Since I'm in Japan and all,

26:01.144 --> 26:05.106
I should take a nice,
long bath at least once...

26:11.905 --> 26:13.907
Who's there?

26:15.242 --> 26:17.452
The hotel maid?

26:19.829 --> 26:22.582
I'm sure I put up the "Do not disturb" sign.

26:31.341 --> 26:32.342
Huh?

26:32.550 --> 26:33.635
What's going on?

26:33.843 --> 26:36.179
Makise Kurisu.

26:36.388 --> 26:38.848
There isn't much time, so I'll just say this.

26:39.057 --> 26:39.933
Who are you?

26:40.141 --> 26:41.977
Cell phone.

26:42.185 --> 26:44.187
Microwave oven.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.106
SERN.

26:46.314 --> 26:48.191
Don't forget.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.777
As long as you don't forget,
you have a chance.

26:50.986 --> 26:53.405
As long as you keep observing...

26:55.073 --> 26:56.825
...you can do it.

27:12.173 --> 27:13.842
Who's there?

27:19.889 --> 27:25.937
Cell phone... Microwave oven... SERN...?

27:34.571 --> 27:36.448
<i>What was that?</i>

27:36.656 --> 27:40.410
They didn't steal anything, but, still...

27:40.618 --> 27:44.539
I'm creeped out.
I think I'll switch to a different room.

27:44.748 --> 27:45.749
Hmm?

27:45.957 --> 27:50.170
What creeps you out, Christina?

27:51.379 --> 27:53.923
I-It's nothing!

27:54.132 --> 27:58.053
Nothing scary happened to me
at my hotel at all...

27:58.261 --> 28:01.431
A-Anyway! What are you doing here?!

28:01.639 --> 28:03.850
That's my line to you.

28:04.059 --> 28:06.311
I'm removing the decorative
honors known as grime

28:06.519 --> 28:09.314
that I've amassed over the
course of my daily research,

28:09.522 --> 28:13.443
while also reflecting upon
my successes thus far.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.236
Please don't disturb me.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.907
Unfortunately, this is neither
the lab nor your home!

28:19.115 --> 28:20.075
Let me through!

28:20.283 --> 28:23.578
Even if I <i>am</i> reluctant
to do laundry with you.

28:23.787 --> 28:24.496
Hey.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.622
Don't open that.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.750
You should empty it as soon as it's done!

28:28.958 --> 28:31.878
Wow, this lab coat's seen better days.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.213
Sheesh.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.965
Assistant. Those are Daru's...

28:36.174 --> 28:37.592
...panties.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.143
Good thing I brought disinfectant!

28:47.352 --> 28:50.146
Daru would be saddened by that reaction.

28:50.355 --> 28:52.482
It's not my fault! You're always
wearing that tattered lab coat!

28:52.690 --> 28:54.359
Of course I mistook the two!

28:54.567 --> 28:58.113
The fact that it's in tatters
is what gives it character.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.824
Only to a point!

29:02.617 --> 29:04.953
See? Your sleeve is torn.

29:05.161 --> 29:08.164
Give it here. I'll sew it for you.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.254
Wh-What?

29:14.462 --> 29:16.714
No... It's nothing.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.384
Even I carry a sewing kit, you know.

29:19.592 --> 29:22.262
Oh, right.

29:22.470 --> 29:24.180
Here.

29:24.389 --> 29:26.558
It's a lab coat we use overseas.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.685
You should at least have a spare.

29:28.893 --> 29:33.231
It's American, so it should fit
your height perfectly, just by luck.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.316
Oh...

29:35.525 --> 29:37.068
You bought it just for me?

29:37.277 --> 29:40.071
N-No! It's just coincidence!

29:40.280 --> 29:43.491
They just gave me an extra one they had!

29:43.700 --> 29:48.663
Plus... You did give me
the spoon and fork...

29:54.294 --> 29:56.463
Before you can say anything...

29:56.671 --> 29:59.174
No complaining about my sewing work.

29:59.382 --> 30:03.803
Also, I don't have any white thread...

30:04.012 --> 30:06.264
I see.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.516
What is it?

30:08.725 --> 30:10.143
Nothing...

30:11.978 --> 30:15.064
More alternate world line stuff?

30:15.273 --> 30:20.028
Yes. But also no.

30:20.236 --> 30:23.698
What kind of self-contradicting
nonsense is that?

30:23.907 --> 30:27.744
It's true that my
Reading Steiner ability has allowed me

30:27.952 --> 30:32.999
to retain memories of
other world lines that I've observed.

30:33.208 --> 30:38.213
Countless world lines exist,
all continually converging and diverging.

30:38.421 --> 30:40.924
I drifted along them,
until I miraculously reached

30:41.132 --> 30:45.303
the one and only
world line I kept looking for.

30:45.512 --> 30:49.307
On this world line, you're right here,
sitting in front of me,

30:49.516 --> 30:51.768
and Mayuri is working at May Queen.

30:51.976 --> 30:53.686
That's all that matters.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.064
That's all that I want.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.398
Okabe...

30:57.607 --> 31:03.196
It's possible I've told you
too much again on this world line,

31:03.404 --> 31:05.949
just to have you know more about me.

31:06.157 --> 31:07.408
I apologize.

31:07.617 --> 31:10.954
--Wh-What brought all this on?!
--That's all I have to say.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.623
Your hands have stopped, Assistant.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.375
Y-Yes, I know!

31:15.583 --> 31:21.506
I just... can't help but wonder
if everything you said is true.

31:21.714 --> 31:24.342
I don't blame you for being skeptical.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.803
The idea of multiple world lines existing...

31:27.011 --> 31:28.304
I don't mean that.

31:28.513 --> 31:31.933
Assuming countless world lines <i>do</i> exist,

31:32.141 --> 31:37.397
it's hard to believe you're the only one
who can retain memories across them.

31:37.605 --> 31:41.651
The idea of the Reading Steiner
being yours alone...

31:41.859 --> 31:43.069
Does that bother you?

31:43.278 --> 31:45.363
Not really. It's just...

31:45.572 --> 31:49.117
For example, I'm sewing
your lab coat for you right now.

31:49.325 --> 31:51.869
There's no explanation for it,
but for some reason...

31:52.078 --> 31:55.290
...| feel like I've done
this exact same thing before.

31:55.498 --> 31:58.626
Sounds like déjé vu, doesn't it?
I thought so too.

31:58.835 --> 32:03.423
But it happens a lot whenever I'm with you.

32:03.631 --> 32:08.928
Tell me. Have I done this same thing
on a different world line?

32:10.555 --> 32:13.391
I have, haven't I?

32:13.600 --> 32:14.684
What's your point?

32:14.892 --> 32:15.768
Déjé vu.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.938
It's said to be a memory glitch that occurs

32:19.147 --> 32:22.442
when short-term memory
and long-term memory overlap.

32:22.650 --> 32:26.571
In other words, it's caused
when memories get out of sync.

32:26.779 --> 32:29.824
On the other hand, your
Reading Steiner ability retains memories

32:30.033 --> 32:33.911
of multiple world lines that are produced
whenever the past is changed.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.622
The two share one thing in common:

32:35.830 --> 32:38.207
They're both memory malfunctions
caused by the brain

32:38.416 --> 32:40.251
due to unsynchronized memories.

32:40.460 --> 32:44.922
As evidence, I just correctly attributed
a memory I recognized as déjé vu

32:45.131 --> 32:49.010
to an event that occurred
on a separate world line.

32:49.218 --> 32:53.014
Are you saying déjé vu
is a form of Reading Steiner?

32:53.222 --> 32:57.727
It'd be difficult to prove, but it is possible.

32:57.935 --> 33:01.981
I plan to write a paper on it after I fly back.

33:02.190 --> 33:05.234
You never change, do you?

33:05.443 --> 33:07.028
You inane, experiment-loving girl.

33:07.236 --> 33:09.530
I'll take that as a compliment.

33:09.739 --> 33:13.910
So tell me whenever
anything unusual happens.

33:14.118 --> 33:15.995
That'll make it easier--

33:29.258 --> 33:33.054
Too-too-roo! Lunch break!

33:33.262 --> 33:36.474
Mayushii. Did you get me a lunch?

33:36.683 --> 33:37.350
Yeah!

33:37.558 --> 33:42.480
Today's is a Juicy #1 Chicken Tender
lunch set! It's a new item!

33:42.689 --> 33:45.274
Huh? Didn't we have that yesterday?

33:45.483 --> 33:47.527
--Doing more inventing?
--Yeah.

33:47.735 --> 33:52.657
I was just upgrading
Future Gadget #10: Cool Visitor.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.325
It's perfect this time!

33:54.534 --> 33:57.245
You sure love to invent, Daru-kun!

33:57.453 --> 34:03.251
That is why I founded
the Future Gadget Laboratory, FWIW.

34:04.919 --> 34:07.338
Oh, Kurisu-chan!

34:07.547 --> 34:09.716
What's wrong?

34:09.924 --> 34:12.051
Wh-Where is he?!

34:12.260 --> 34:13.219
Who?

34:13.428 --> 34:14.721
You know!

34:14.929 --> 34:18.808
He was with me at the laundromat
and just suddenly disappeared!

34:20.560 --> 34:21.978
Who are you talking about?

34:22.186 --> 34:24.438
What do you mean?
I'm talking about, you know...

34:24.647 --> 34:28.192
The person who's always here.
This lab's founder.

34:28.400 --> 34:29.402
This lab's?

34:29.610 --> 34:30.777
That'd be me.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.697
Huh? Wh-What are you talking about?

34:33.906 --> 34:35.533
Do you maybe mean Ruka-kun?

34:35.742 --> 34:36.993
No!

34:37.201 --> 34:39.871
Faris-tan? Or Ms. Kiryuu?

34:40.079 --> 34:43.248
No! You know! Err...

34:43.458 --> 34:45.585
Oh, yes! Lab Member 001!

34:45.793 --> 34:47.003
001?

34:47.210 --> 34:49.547
001 is unused.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.091
We told you before, remember?

34:52.300 --> 34:55.344
We decided to leave 001 open.

34:55.553 --> 34:58.055
B-But...

34:58.264 --> 35:00.141
Then... whose lab coat is this?!

35:00.349 --> 35:03.102
It's yours, of course.

35:03.311 --> 35:05.104
Mine?!

35:09.358 --> 35:11.277
You're right...

35:11.486 --> 35:14.989
Why was I so flustered?

35:15.198 --> 35:18.409
I was worried that
something had happened!

35:18.618 --> 35:19.786
S-Sorry!

35:19.994 --> 35:21.746
Have you gone wacko too, Ms. Makise?

35:21.954 --> 35:22.872
No!

35:24.457 --> 35:30.213
I think that moment was
the first time things felt "off" to me.

35:33.716 --> 35:35.593
Something was missing.

35:35.802 --> 35:41.599
Something that was always around
was now clearly gone.

35:41.808 --> 35:44.352
I was certain of it...

35:45.770 --> 35:48.397
...yet I didn't know what it was.

35:49.649 --> 35:54.904
Things felt wrong. As if this world
wasn't real, but a fabrication.

35:55.112 --> 35:59.826
I was worried someone
might be manipulating my memory

36:00.034 --> 36:05.081
while simultaneously fearing
that this was all a delusion

36:05.289 --> 36:09.585
and that I'd just lost my mind.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.843
I was filled with
both the urge to remember

36:17.051 --> 36:20.012
and the temptation to forget
everything and be at peace.

36:20.221 --> 36:23.599
These feelings
constantly clashed inside me...

36:26.644 --> 36:28.229
A week later, after the feeling
of "wrongness" had begun to fade away...

36:29.814 --> 36:31.148
And Personal Spoon

36:35.486 --> 36:39.657
...a hint presented itself.

36:39.866 --> 36:41.742
My personal fork?

37:10.479 --> 37:13.357
As long as you don't forget,
you have a chance.

37:20.907 --> 37:21.866
Hello?

37:22.074 --> 37:24.035
Do you have a minute?

37:24.243 --> 37:27.830
Super Fappy Time just ended,
so I'm all ears.

37:28.039 --> 37:30.750
Too much information!

37:30.958 --> 37:33.002
You've heard of SERN, right?

37:33.210 --> 37:38.215
Eep! What the heck?
Did you sneak a peek at my PC?

37:38.424 --> 37:39.717
What are you talking about?

37:39.926 --> 37:42.887
I hacked into it on my own, TBH.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.598
You hacked into SERN?!

37:45.806 --> 37:48.309
--What for?
--Well, because...

37:48.517 --> 37:50.686
I'm not sure.

37:52.188 --> 37:55.066
Stay at the lab. I'll be right there!

38:05.576 --> 38:07.536
Cell phone...

38:09.497 --> 38:10.915
SERN!

38:24.428 --> 38:27.390
Oh, that's a cute ribbon!

38:27.598 --> 38:29.350
Isn't it, though?

38:29.558 --> 38:34.063
Do you want to try it on? I have
plenty of other costumes for Comima!

38:34.271 --> 38:35.272
Cosplay, huh...

38:35.481 --> 38:37.525
Oh, are you interested?

38:37.733 --> 38:42.822
O-Of course not!
I couldn't dress like that in public...

38:43.030 --> 38:44.240
It's done!

38:44.448 --> 38:45.783
Ta-dah!

38:45.992 --> 38:47.952
I win!

38:48.160 --> 38:49.286
You got us!

38:49.495 --> 38:51.539
But we're done too.

38:51.747 --> 38:52.832
It's finished now!

38:53.040 --> 38:54.959
This is...

38:56.335 --> 38:59.213
This is the time leap machine, zomg?

38:59.422 --> 39:01.424
I don't fully believe it, either.

39:01.632 --> 39:04.969
But we're taking brain signals,
usurping SERN's LHC to compress them,

39:05.177 --> 39:09.557
and then sending them back in time
with this microwave oven.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.309
Theoretically, it's sound.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.146
How'd you come up with all this?

39:15.354 --> 39:19.859
If anything, it'd be more correct
to say that I "remembered" it.

39:20.067 --> 39:23.279
You mean you've made this before?

39:23.487 --> 39:25.823
No, I have no memory of it.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.033
But I can recall it in bits and pieces.

39:28.159 --> 39:29.326
Time Leap Machine

39:29.535 --> 39:29.702
Wait, is it déjé vu then?

39:32.621 --> 39:33.080
I don't know.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.417
But, for example, Hashida.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.794
What made you decide to hack into SERN?

39:39.003 --> 39:41.297
Huh? Well...

39:41.505 --> 39:44.258
I guess I thought it'd be |33t and exciting...

39:44.467 --> 39:45.259
ls that all?

39:45.468 --> 39:46.802
Was there...

39:47.011 --> 39:51.557
Was there some part of you
that said you needed to do it?

39:51.766 --> 39:52.558
Mayuri.

39:52.767 --> 39:55.478
Why do you always buy that Dk Pepper?

39:55.686 --> 39:59.607
Huh? I just figure someone will drink it...

39:59.815 --> 40:03.110
Neither Hashida nor I
are particularly fond of it.

40:03.319 --> 40:05.488
Neither are you, I assume.

40:05.696 --> 40:09.158
But you buy some almost every day.

40:09.366 --> 40:13.162
Hmm... I guess you're right...

40:13.370 --> 40:15.039
Somethings...

40:15.247 --> 40:17.750
Something's not right.

40:17.958 --> 40:18.542
Something's missing.

40:19.710 --> 40:21.128
What is?

40:21.337 --> 40:22.880
I don't know.

40:23.089 --> 40:24.924
That's why...

40:25.132 --> 40:26.092
No way!

40:26.300 --> 40:28.844
You're really going to use this, Kurisu-chan?

40:29.053 --> 40:30.262
I'm hesitant, too.

40:30.471 --> 40:33.724
If this really does send me back in time,

40:33.933 --> 40:39.480
it's possible I might alter past events
and drastically affect the world.

40:39.688 --> 40:43.359
But I can't ignore
this current situation, either.

40:43.567 --> 40:45.194
What do you plan to do?

40:45.402 --> 40:49.073
I'll go back to the day before
I went to the laundromat.

40:49.281 --> 40:52.201
I remember most everything I did then.

40:52.409 --> 40:57.164
Huh? You can go back more than 48 hours?

40:57.373 --> 41:00.584
Who said that 48 hours is the limit?

41:00.793 --> 41:02.920
Wham?

41:03.129 --> 41:06.465
Why <i>didl</i> assume that?

41:06.674 --> 41:08.300
I'll act in line with my memories

41:08.509 --> 41:11.178
and minimize my impact on past events.

41:11.387 --> 41:13.097
There's only one thing I need to ascertain.

41:13.305 --> 41:16.392
I need to figure out
why things feel "wrong" now.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.769
Do you think this will work?

41:18.978 --> 41:20.563
If it doesn't, I'll leave it at that.

41:20.771 --> 41:24.150
And I'll never use this machine again.

41:24.358 --> 41:27.069
Neither should you two.

41:31.949 --> 41:33.409
We're in.

41:33.617 --> 41:36.537
Are you sure about this, Ms. Makise?

41:41.667 --> 41:43.002
If you would, Hashida!

41:43.210 --> 41:44.003
I Kay.

41:44.211 --> 41:46.046
Here goes nothing!

42:04.690 --> 42:09.153
--Mixy, mixy! Mixy, mixy!
--Woot! Eye Contact Mixy-Mixy Yakisoba!

42:09.361 --> 42:11.447
--Mixy, mixy!
--Oh, you pain me so, Faris-tan!

42:11.655 --> 42:15.534
Oh! You can eat green peppers, Nae-chan!

42:15.743 --> 42:16.744
I'm impressed!

42:16.952 --> 42:20.080
--Yeah! But my dad won't eat them at all!

42:20.080 --> 42:22.208
--Nae-chan... Mayuri...
--Yeah! But my dad won't eat them at all!

42:22.416 --> 42:23.959
Hashida...

42:24.168 --> 42:26.170
Fa ris-san...

42:26.378 --> 42:27.630
The shopkeeper...

42:27.838 --> 42:29.757
Kiryuu-san...

42:29.965 --> 42:32.301
And Urushibara-san...

42:37.264 --> 42:38.390
Okabe?!

42:38.599 --> 42:41.268
What's wrong, Kurisu-chan?

42:41.477 --> 42:43.270
ls something the matter with Okarin?

42:43.479 --> 42:46.315
O-Okabe?

42:46.523 --> 42:48.734
How did I forget him?

42:48.943 --> 42:51.820
No... I hadn't forgotten.

42:52.029 --> 42:55.115
It was as if he had never existed.

43:00.120 --> 43:00.913
Now, then!

43:01.121 --> 43:05.251
As this lab's founder,
I would like to make a toast!

43:05.459 --> 43:08.045
First, does everyone have a drink, meow?

43:08.254 --> 43:11.674
Geez, hurry up! Cheers!

43:11.882 --> 43:14.927
Now Okabe has never existed...

43:15.135 --> 43:16.971
Here, Big Sis!

43:24.311 --> 43:27.648
I wonder if Okarin will have any shrimp...

43:34.029 --> 43:35.614
Okabe!

43:44.331 --> 43:47.751
It looks like your time leap was a success.

43:50.379 --> 43:51.297
Who is this?

43:51.505 --> 43:53.716
On the building to your right.

44:09.898 --> 44:13.152
To talk to you about this, Makise Kurisu...

44:13.360 --> 44:18.866
...| first needed you to become
an observer of this world.

44:19.074 --> 44:20.659
Observer?

44:20.868 --> 44:23.454
By time-leaping to this point,

44:23.662 --> 44:26.332
you're now able to perceive
Okabe Rintaro's disappearances--

44:26.540 --> 44:27.416
Wait!

44:27.624 --> 44:30.044
First, just who are you?

44:31.086 --> 44:34.089
Sorry! I haven't introduced myself, have l?

44:34.298 --> 44:37.176
I'm Amane Suzuha.

44:37.384 --> 44:39.094
I came from the future...

44:39.303 --> 44:43.599
...in a time machine your future self built.

44:43.807 --> 44:46.894
That <i>I</i> built?

44:47.102 --> 44:49.188
I don't blame you for not believing me.

44:49.396 --> 44:56.320
But Okabe Rintaro's existence on
the Steins Gate world line is very fragile.

44:56.528 --> 45:00.532
His memories of other world lines
are overloading his Reading Steiner,

45:00.741 --> 45:04.411
which has made it difficult for him
to stay on this world line.

45:04.620 --> 45:06.538
Then where is he now?!

45:06.747 --> 45:10.167
On the R world line, most likely.

45:10.376 --> 45:17.341
A world line that's only 0.000001% off
from this Steins Gate world line.

45:17.549 --> 45:20.552
This is the one and only world line
that avoids the convergences

45:20.761 --> 45:24.014
of Shiina Mayuri's
and Makise Kurisu's deaths.

45:24.223 --> 45:28.102
Thus, it's less stable than other
world lines and prone to fluctuations.

45:28.310 --> 45:34.108
There also exists an R world line--
one that exists right next to this one.

45:34.316 --> 45:37.361
Okabe Rintaro's memories
from drifting across world lines

45:37.569 --> 45:39.988
have overloaded
his Reading Steiner so much

45:40.197 --> 45:44.660
that he now picks up on those fluctuations
and gets sent to the R world line.

45:44.868 --> 45:49.998
And that results in him
never existing on this world line...

45:50.207 --> 45:53.627
ls that the cause of my dizzy spells?

45:53.836 --> 45:55.045
Okabe!

45:55.254 --> 45:56.588
You were listening?

45:56.797 --> 45:57.756
Yeah.

45:57.965 --> 46:00.092
I find it hard to believe,

46:00.300 --> 46:03.303
but if the Part-Time Warrior
says it's true, then it must be.

46:03.512 --> 46:06.682
Part-Time Warrior? What's that?

46:06.890 --> 46:07.683
Oh, right.

46:07.891 --> 46:12.729
You're not a part-timer
or a warrior on this world line.

46:12.938 --> 46:14.440
Okabe!

46:22.448 --> 46:23.949
Okabe?!

46:32.374 --> 46:33.417
I disappear?

46:33.625 --> 46:35.794
Yes, tomorrow morning.

46:36.003 --> 46:43.427
And after that, it's as if
you've never existed for any of us.

46:43.635 --> 46:45.888
Never existed...

46:46.096 --> 46:49.725
Your powerful memories
from other world lines act as a trigger

46:49.933 --> 46:52.769
and cause you to perceive
this world line's fluctuations.

46:52.978 --> 46:58.442
And then you, observing this world
as reality, end up fluctuating too.

46:58.650 --> 47:01.320
You can't control memories.

47:01.528 --> 47:03.197
This is bad.

47:03.405 --> 47:06.074
Even if you try your hardest
to forget certain memories,

47:06.283 --> 47:10.329
parts of them will always stick with you
whether you want them to or not.

47:10.537 --> 47:11.997
Especially in your case.

47:12.206 --> 47:17.127
You experienced all sorts of intense fear
and sorrow on other world lines.

47:17.336 --> 47:23.175
The feelings of self-blame
remain fresh in your memory, too.

47:23.383 --> 47:25.177
And now you're surrounded

47:25.385 --> 47:30.307
by the exact same people, the same room,
the same city, and the same words.

47:30.516 --> 47:32.935
Trying to forget would be impossible.

47:33.143 --> 47:37.856
Your memories of other world lines
are like dreams, yet aren't dreams.

47:38.065 --> 47:41.944
They're memories that are real,
but shouldn't be real.

47:42.152 --> 47:47.157
That ambiguity makes your awareness
of those memories even more dangerous.

47:47.366 --> 47:51.495
And you came here from the future
to save me from that?

47:51.703 --> 47:53.622
You could say that.

47:53.830 --> 47:58.585
Taking a time machine to the past
is the only way to save Okabe Rintaro.

47:58.794 --> 48:00.504
--Which is why--
--I refuse!

48:00.712 --> 48:02.548
Return to the future right now!

48:02.756 --> 48:05.551
And destroy the time machine.

48:05.759 --> 48:08.053
It must not be allowed to exist!

48:08.262 --> 48:10.764
Destroy it immediately!

48:10.973 --> 48:11.974
Wait!

48:12.182 --> 48:13.517
If she does that...!

48:13.725 --> 48:17.563
After all I went through to time-leap here!

48:19.189 --> 48:21.692
Wait... You're saying...

48:21.900 --> 48:23.569
...you time-leapt here?!

48:23.777 --> 48:27.364
H-Hashida and I built it.

48:27.573 --> 48:29.074
Using a cell phone, microwave oven, and--

48:29.283 --> 48:30.659
Why did you build it?!

48:30.867 --> 48:34.621
Time-leap machines and
time machines mustn't ever be built!

48:34.830 --> 48:37.708
Even if you come up with the theory
or figure out how to make it work,

48:37.916 --> 48:40.586
you must <i>never</i> build one!

48:40.794 --> 48:43.630
Okabe... You're hurting me...

48:45.090 --> 48:46.800
Sorry...

48:48.760 --> 48:52.806
You're going to disappear if I do nothing...

48:53.015 --> 48:56.685
You'll never have existed.

48:56.893 --> 48:59.563
The only way to prevent that
is to change the past--

48:59.771 --> 49:02.065
What if it doesn't work?!

49:04.651 --> 49:07.988
What if you change the past
but it doesn't ﬁx things?

49:10.532 --> 49:12.200
The answer is simple.

49:12.409 --> 49:13.744
You'll try again.

49:13.952 --> 49:17.623
You'll keep going back in time,
trying over and over until you succeed.

49:17.831 --> 49:21.460
As long as there's a way to go back
in time, that's what a person <i>will</i> do!

49:21.668 --> 49:23.462
That's what they'll end up doing!

49:23.670 --> 49:27.716
But it'll only increase their suffering.

49:27.924 --> 49:32.929
A single change to the past
will always affect something else.

49:33.138 --> 49:37.851
Nothing will ever change
exactly as you want.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.603
If you save someone...

49:39.811 --> 49:42.189
...you'll lose someone.

49:42.397 --> 49:44.900
You'll undo dreams
that have finally come true.

49:45.108 --> 49:48.070
You'll take away
long-held wishes and destroy them.

49:48.278 --> 49:52.908
Yet, even after all that, you'll never
achieve the changes you want.

49:53.116 --> 49:55.786
Instead, you'll keep facing
an inescapable reality!

49:55.994 --> 49:59.206
Over and over and over and over...

50:00.082 --> 50:03.043
Can you understand the sorrow of bearing
the responsibility for all those losses,

50:03.251 --> 50:06.338
yet having to repeat it over and over?

50:06.546 --> 50:10.217
Can you understand the horror
of having that wear away at your mind

50:10.425 --> 50:12.886
and take away your humanity?

50:13.095 --> 50:15.764
--But...
--Even if there is a way,

50:15.972 --> 50:18.725
the past must never be changed.

50:18.934 --> 50:21.978
"What ifs" must <i>never</i> be made real.

50:22.187 --> 50:24.481
The fact that nobody knows the future--

50:24.690 --> 50:26.692
the fact that there are no do-overs-

50:26.900 --> 50:29.945
is what lets people accept all sorts of
hardship, pain, and unfair accidents

50:30.153 --> 50:31.947
and then move forward.

50:32.155 --> 50:35.075
Then what are you going to do?!

50:35.283 --> 50:36.201
Okabe...

50:36.410 --> 50:39.204
You're going to disappear
for good, you know!

50:39.413 --> 50:42.332
I... saw it...

50:42.541 --> 50:45.210
A world where you never exist...

50:45.419 --> 50:49.297
A lab with only Mayuri, Hashida, and me...

50:49.506 --> 50:52.759
A lab where no one remembers you...

50:52.968 --> 50:56.096
That's even worse than death!

50:56.304 --> 51:00.434
You'll have lived for nothing!
You won't have lived at all!

51:04.229 --> 51:05.939
I don't care.

51:08.734 --> 51:09.901
Okabe...

51:10.110 --> 51:13.196
All I wanted was for you
and Mayuri to survive

51:13.405 --> 51:16.575
and keep on living into the future.

51:16.783 --> 51:18.702
That's all.

51:18.910 --> 51:20.704
That's all that matters to me.

51:20.912 --> 51:24.249
Everything you're saying now,
everything you've ever done,

51:24.458 --> 51:26.251
and even your name...

51:26.460 --> 51:27.961
It's all going to be forgotten!

51:28.170 --> 51:32.507
But Mayuri won't die,
and you'll live on too.

51:52.486 --> 51:55.197
How long are you going to
keep following me?

51:55.405 --> 51:59.034
I'm not. I'm just going to the station.

51:59.242 --> 52:00.619
Your hotel isn't this way.

52:00.827 --> 52:02.329
I have things to do.

52:02.537 --> 52:03.371
Where?

52:03.580 --> 52:06.416
What does it matter? I can do what I want.

52:31.399 --> 52:33.527
There's one thing I should say.

52:33.735 --> 52:35.028
What is it?

52:35.237 --> 52:38.406
The moment I disappear tomorrow...

52:38.615 --> 52:44.162
...no one around you
will think I ever existed.

52:44.371 --> 52:50.627
But, because you time-leapt here,
you might still remember me.

52:50.836 --> 52:53.213
Y-Yes, that's true.

52:53.421 --> 52:58.593
Everyone has the Reading Steiner ability,
even if just a little bit.

52:58.802 --> 53:04.015
Since you've traveled across time,
you might experience it even more.

53:04.224 --> 53:07.936
So... What are you trying to say?

53:08.144 --> 53:09.646
Forget.

53:10.814 --> 53:12.566
Forget me.

53:12.774 --> 53:17.195
Think of me as someone who
never existed, just as the others will.

53:17.404 --> 53:20.949
Think of this moment as a dream.

53:21.157 --> 53:26.830
It's painful being the only one who
remembers something nobody else does.

53:27.038 --> 53:31.626
You can't talk to anyone about it.
Even if you try, no one understands.

53:31.835 --> 53:34.087
You're all alone.

53:34.296 --> 53:38.133
ls that... how it's always been for you?

53:39.676 --> 53:41.428
If so...

53:43.722 --> 53:45.515
Kurisu...

53:45.724 --> 53:48.685
If so, then I can't accept that.

53:48.894 --> 53:51.688
I need you to exist!

53:59.487 --> 54:03.533
If I listened to you
on a different world line...

54:03.742 --> 54:05.577
...then do the same for me!

54:05.785 --> 54:09.873
Stay with me and hear me out!

54:10.081 --> 54:12.667
You suffered all alone for so long...

54:12.876 --> 54:15.337
...and now you're vanishing all alone...

54:15.545 --> 54:19.299
That's... That's...

54:19.507 --> 54:21.384
...too selfish!

54:24.179 --> 54:25.972
There's nothing to worry about.

54:26.181 --> 54:28.767
Daru is my right-hand man.

54:28.975 --> 54:31.603
You can count on him when you need to.

54:31.811 --> 54:36.441
Despite how she seems, Mayuri is
more mature than you in some ways.

54:36.650 --> 54:38.944
When you're hurting,
you can cry on her shoulder.

54:39.152 --> 54:41.363
She'll be there for you.

54:41.571 --> 54:45.200
So will Faris, Rukako, and everyone else.

54:45.408 --> 54:47.494
There's nothing to worry about.

54:47.702 --> 54:48.912
You dummy!

54:49.120 --> 54:52.666
That's not what I'm trying to say...!

55:13.144 --> 55:14.938
That's not fair...

55:15.146 --> 55:18.942
You do something that'll remain
so intensely in my hippocampus...

55:19.150 --> 55:21.027
...and then ask me to forget?

55:21.236 --> 55:23.279
It's not fair.

55:23.488 --> 55:24.948
Sorry.

55:25.156 --> 55:27.367
It's not fair...

55:45.719 --> 55:50.849
Okabe didn't contact me at all after that.

55:51.057 --> 55:54.269
No calls, no e-mails...

55:54.477 --> 55:57.814
I didn't contact him, either.

55:58.023 --> 56:00.734
I wasn't sure what to say.

56:02.027 --> 56:05.196
There was nothing I <i>could</i> say...

56:05.405 --> 56:09.617
I'm sure the same was true for him...

56:29.846 --> 56:33.933
From‘. Okabe
Goodbye

56:39.439 --> 56:41.066
Dummy...

56:50.450 --> 56:52.077
You dummy!

56:52.285 --> 56:53.620
Why?

56:53.828 --> 56:55.663
Why?!

56:55.872 --> 56:58.458
This makes me seem like the stupid one!

56:58.666 --> 57:01.920
You tell me a bunch of nonsense,
boss me around,

57:02.128 --> 57:03.880
and then say you love me...!

57:04.089 --> 57:06.382
For some reason, I can't forget you!

57:06.591 --> 57:07.759
If l...

57:07.967 --> 57:09.969
If I don't do something now...!

57:10.845 --> 57:12.889
Okarin!

57:13.098 --> 57:15.683
This is the color of Dk Pepper, right?

57:15.892 --> 57:20.438
Indeed. It truly gives off
the aura of intelligence.

57:21.856 --> 57:24.275
I wanna see you wearing it, plzkthx.

57:24.484 --> 57:26.820
Quiet, Perverted Gentleman.

57:30.156 --> 57:32.909
Okabe... Okabe!

57:37.705 --> 57:39.541
What's your problem?!

57:39.749 --> 57:42.418
There's no way I can forget!

57:42.627 --> 57:43.878
After all...

57:44.087 --> 57:47.757
I've known you for a long, long time!

57:47.966 --> 57:51.803
I've had feelings for you
for a long, long time...

57:54.389 --> 57:59.686
And I'll keep feeling that way...
for a long, long time!

58:03.773 --> 58:05.567
Okarin?

58:07.026 --> 58:10.113
Oh, I'm fine.

58:12.574 --> 58:14.576
Big Sis!

58:17.036 --> 58:18.621
Okabe!

58:19.497 --> 58:20.290
Kurisu?!

58:20.498 --> 58:23.293
Okabe, l...!

58:34.179 --> 58:35.763
Mayushii! Tissues!

58:35.972 --> 58:38.725
--Get some tissues!
--Oh, right!

58:38.933 --> 58:41.644
--There! There!
--Tissues, tissues...

58:48.151 --> 58:49.527
Ku <i>risu-chan?</i>

58:49.736 --> 58:52.030
What's wrong?

58:54.240 --> 58:56.367
--Where is he?
--Who?

58:56.576 --> 59:00.288
Him. He was just right there...

59:00.496 --> 59:01.539
Who are you talking about?

59:01.748 --> 59:05.251
I'm talking about, you know...!

59:05.460 --> 59:09.172
The person who's always here.
This lab's founder.

59:09.380 --> 59:11.466
<i>This lab?</i>

59:13.718 --> 59:15.887
That'd be me.

59:26.773 --> 59:29.817
O... kabe...

59:30.026 --> 59:33.404
Rin... ta... ro...

59:34.405 --> 59:36.491
Yes...

59:36.699 --> 59:40.245
Okabe... Rintaro...

59:46.417 --> 59:48.878
What's wrong, Kurisu-chan?

59:49.087 --> 59:51.172
Did someone grope you?

01:00:09.065 --> 01:00:10.858
Hashida! Give me your cell phone!

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.443
Huh? What for?

01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:14.070
Just do it!

01:00:14.279 --> 01:00:16.322
And then hack into SERN right away!

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:18.283
“Huh?!
“Quiddy!

01:00:18.491 --> 01:00:20.410
This is wrong.

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:25.873
I don't care what you said!
I can't accept this!

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:31.296
You shouldn't, Kurisu-chan.

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:32.338
Mayuri...

01:00:32.547 --> 01:00:35.591
I don't really know why,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.804
but I think it'll only bring you pain.

01:00:50.023 --> 01:00:53.526
That's when I made up my mind.

01:00:55.987 --> 01:00:59.615
I decided to abide by your wishes.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:05.163
I decided to give up controlling time
and manipulating the past,

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:07.081
and to accept this world--which you
struggled to preserve-as reality.

01:01:11.294 --> 01:01:13.629
I decided to forget my memories of you--

01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:17.884
even the name "Okabe Rintaro"--

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:24.015
and move forward into the unknown future.

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:28.478
Because that's what you wanted.

01:01:33.358 --> 01:01:35.651
Oh, Daru-kun?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:37.153
Oh, you're not coming today?

01:01:37.362 --> 01:01:41.657
It's too hot in the lab,
plus today's the Rai-Net tournament.

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:42.658
Oh...

01:01:42.867 --> 01:01:46.537
You should come, too!
You and Faris-tan can do a Twin Battle!

01:01:46.746 --> 01:01:50.208
I would, but I'm not
scheduled to work today.

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.459
Later, then.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.086
Mm.

01:01:59.634 --> 01:02:01.052
Are you ready?

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:05.014
We will now commence
Operation Midgard!

01:02:17.568 --> 01:02:20.822
Oh, Moeka-san! What brings you here?

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:25.535
My boss... needs to talk to you.

01:02:25.743 --> 01:02:29.831
In short, many believe that neuroscience
has yet to reach any accurate conclusions

01:02:30.039 --> 01:02:36.462
regarding the phenomenon of "dreams"
and the function they serve.

01:02:36.671 --> 01:02:41.509
I plan to discuss this subject
during my next lecture.

01:02:42.885 --> 01:02:44.679
<i>Stimulus
Error</i>

01:02:58.443 --> 01:03:03.406
I need to decide where to have dinner...

01:03:04.907 --> 01:03:07.118
There's nothing we can do.

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:09.245
Are you serious?!

01:03:09.454 --> 01:03:13.583
I gathered up all my pocket money too,
but it's just not enough...

01:03:13.791 --> 01:03:17.086
So you're just going to give up?!
We're going to lose the lab!

01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:21.257
Why are you so upset?

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:22.425
l~\

01:03:22.633 --> 01:03:28.806
Paying rent's been
a pain lately anyways, IMO...

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:30.558
Oh...

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:34.061
I started this lab
thinking we could do something,

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:35.730
but we never really did.

01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:37.523
But what about Mayuri?!

01:03:37.732 --> 01:03:39.650
Where is she going to go
if we lose this place?!

01:03:39.859 --> 01:03:43.696
I'll be fine. I always have the café I work at.

01:03:43.905 --> 01:03:45.740
Mayuri...

01:03:45.948 --> 01:03:49.160
To be honest, this place has felt

01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:55.500
kind of sad and lonely for me too lately.

01:03:55.708 --> 01:04:00.880
It's like... something's missing, I suppose.

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:06.719
Missing? What is?

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:11.182
That's the thing. I'm not really sure.

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:14.101
Oh.

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:16.521
--See you later.
--Mm.

01:04:16.729 --> 01:04:19.023
The lab isn't going to vanish
right away or anything.

01:04:19.232 --> 01:04:21.317
I'll e-mail you if anything happens.

01:04:21.526 --> 01:04:22.527
Mm.

01:04:22.735 --> 01:04:25.154
Cheer up, Kurisu-chan.

01:04:25.363 --> 01:04:28.241
Yeah. I'll be okay.

01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:30.826
Well, I should go.

01:04:41.546 --> 01:04:44.590
<i>This</i> is reality... <i>This</i> is the world...

01:04:44.799 --> 01:04:46.133
That's right.

01:04:46.342 --> 01:04:49.387
This is the reality of this world line.

01:04:50.930 --> 01:04:54.767
I figured I should see you one last time.

01:04:54.976 --> 01:04:57.853
I've decided to return to the future.

01:04:59.272 --> 01:05:03.818
If you've decided to accept this world
where Okabe Rintaro no longer exists,

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:07.905
then I have no reason to stay anymore.

01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:10.533
I'll ask one final time.

01:05:10.741 --> 01:05:13.411
Are you sure you won't change your mind?

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:15.413
Unfortunately, there are no records

01:05:15.621 --> 01:05:19.792
of Okabe Rintaro appearing
on this world line any time after this.

01:05:20.001 --> 01:05:22.086
In other words, once I leave,

01:05:22.295 --> 01:05:24.672
you'll never see Okabe Rintaro again.

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:28.884
Are you really okay with that?

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:34.724
Okabe told me not to
change the past, no matter what.

01:05:34.932 --> 01:05:38.060
I agree with him. The risks of altering--

01:05:38.269 --> 01:05:40.146
That's not what I'm asking!

01:05:40.354 --> 01:05:42.648
How do you feel about it?!

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:47.862
My feelings... won't change.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:51.449
I should've guessed it would be this way.

01:05:51.657 --> 01:05:56.245
The truth is... you build
a time machine in the future.

01:05:56.454 --> 01:05:57.330
What do you mean?

01:05:57.538 --> 01:06:00.249
Makise Kurisu developed a time machine.

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:04.587
But she kept anyone from using it.
She asked my dad to seal it away.

01:06:04.795 --> 01:06:07.923
She says that's what Okabe Rintaro wanted.

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:11.302
In other words,
you keep contradicting yourself.

01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:13.721
You want to save Okabe Rintaro
and see him again,

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:18.059
so you devise a way to go back in time
and then build a time machine.

01:06:18.267 --> 01:06:22.229
But then you give up,
because you can't be honest with yourself.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:25.232
You repeat that over and over.

01:06:25.441 --> 01:06:27.151
So that's why you...?

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:33.199
I thought maybe your earlier self
might be honest with her feelings.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.371
But it turns out you're hard-headed after all.

01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:40.373
What?! That's a rude way to put it!

01:06:40.581 --> 01:06:41.374
It's the truth.

01:06:41.582 --> 01:06:43.459
I'm a scientist!

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:46.087
I act on logic and certainty!

01:06:46.295 --> 01:06:48.673
I can't be swayed by emotions--

01:06:48.881 --> 01:06:51.300
You always pretend to be
cool-headed like that!

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:54.220
You're so irritating to be around!

01:06:54.428 --> 01:06:57.223
The feeling's mutual!

01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:00.434
Okabe Rintaro is gone.

01:07:00.643 --> 01:07:06.691
But the world keeps on going,
as if nothing had ever happened.

01:07:06.899 --> 01:07:09.902
But you <i>do</i> build a time machine.

01:07:10.111 --> 01:07:11.487
What's most important to you?

01:07:11.696 --> 01:07:14.365
Your pride as a scientist? Your ethics?

01:07:14.573 --> 01:07:15.950
ls that all that matters?

01:07:16.158 --> 01:07:19.912
Do you have anything
to live for in this world?!

01:07:27.712 --> 01:07:29.422
This is the time machine?

01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:30.923
Let's go.

01:07:31.132 --> 01:07:32.550
ls this really possible?

01:07:32.758 --> 01:07:35.136
Your future self said so.

01:07:35.344 --> 01:07:38.681
It's true that altering the past
will move the world line.

01:07:38.889 --> 01:07:41.350
So you'll need to change
Okabe Rintaro's memories

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:44.019
without actually changing
any events whatsoever.

01:07:44.228 --> 01:07:45.396
His memories?

01:07:45.604 --> 01:07:51.360
Okabe Rintaro is unable to perceive this
Steins Gate world line as the real world.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.779
You need to make him recognize
that this world line

01:07:53.988 --> 01:07:58.117
is the only one that's
clearly different from all the others.

01:07:58.325 --> 01:08:01.162
And his memories are the key to that?

01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:03.581
Yes.

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:07.543
You need to plant in him just one powerful
memory that no other world line has.

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:10.129
That will put it into his brain
that this world line

01:08:10.337 --> 01:08:12.298
is clearly different from all the others,

01:08:12.506 --> 01:08:17.845
thus freeing him from his
overloaded Reading Steiner state.

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:21.348
That is a sound hypothesis.
I have to hand it to my future self.

01:08:21.557 --> 01:08:24.935
You never attempted to travel back in time,
though, despite knowing all that.

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:26.187
Sit there.

01:08:26.395 --> 01:08:30.191
That's my conscience as a scientist.
It's praiseworthy, if anything.

01:08:30.399 --> 01:08:31.274
Narcissist.

01:08:31.484 --> 01:08:33.611
How rude. It's not like that at all.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:36.738
I'm... just a scientist.

01:08:36.947 --> 01:08:39.033
You're just like her in that regard.

01:08:39.241 --> 01:08:42.328
I guess it's only natural.
You are the same person.

01:08:42.536 --> 01:08:44.205
Okay, let's go. What year do you want?

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.081
Huh? You haven't chosen?

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:48.959
You should know better than I do

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:54.215
when the best time would be to plant
a powerful memory in Okabe Rintaro's brain.

01:08:56.091 --> 01:08:58.219
--2005.
--Based on what?

01:08:58.426 --> 01:09:00.930
Something Mayuri told me.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:05.225
Intense memories are created by
and associated with intense events.

01:09:05.434 --> 01:09:08.229
All right. I'll put my trust in you.

01:09:08.437 --> 01:09:09.229
Here we go!

01:09:09.438 --> 01:09:12.107
The Gs will be intense, so be ready!

01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:30.042
It's up to you now.

01:09:30.251 --> 01:09:31.836
You won't have a cell phone, so contact me--

01:09:32.044 --> 01:09:35.005
Wait, what exactly am I supposed to do?

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:39.218
I told you what the goal is.
But I don't know how to achieve it.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:41.804
You said you would know how to plant

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:45.890
a powerful memory in him
better than I would.

01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:49.353
--My future self said that?
--Yes.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.399
I do have Mayuri's address,

01:09:53.607 --> 01:09:55.067
but I have no way to get Okabe's,
since he disappeared from the world line.

01:09:58.863 --> 01:10:01.448
I assume it's around here.

01:10:01.657 --> 01:10:04.451
But... If I do find him, then what?

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:07.037
How should I talk to him? What should I do?

01:10:07.246 --> 01:10:09.039
If I mess up...

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:13.586
"A single change to the past
will always affect something else."

01:10:13.794 --> 01:10:18.215
"Nothing will <i>ever</i> change
exactly as you want."

01:10:30.102 --> 01:10:32.187
Okabe...

01:10:39.945 --> 01:10:43.741
Okabe!

01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:45.034
Okabe!

01:10:45.242 --> 01:10:46.952
Okabe!

01:10:47.161 --> 01:10:49.663
Wait! I need to talk to you!

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:08.974
It's okay. The world will converge.

01:11:09.183 --> 01:11:10.351
I see...

01:11:10.559 --> 01:11:14.647
So Okabe absolutely won't die there.

01:11:14.855 --> 01:11:15.981
It's okay...

01:11:16.190 --> 01:11:18.317
I have nothing to worry about...

01:11:18.525 --> 01:11:20.945
Even so, I can't help but wonder...

01:11:21.153 --> 01:11:23.072
If I were to go back in time again,

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.617
would Okabe get hit by a car again?

01:11:26.825 --> 01:11:30.913
Or would the past get changed
in an even worse way?

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:35.250
Both are very possible if I interfere.

01:11:35.459 --> 01:11:39.088
Even so, Okabe Rintaro
won't die in that time period.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:41.256
Don't you understand, Amane-san?

01:11:41.465 --> 01:11:43.634
The fact that he absolutely won't die then

01:11:43.842 --> 01:11:47.680
also means I absolutely
won't be able to save him!

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.598
But, your future self says...!

01:11:49.807 --> 01:11:57.648
Okabe endured this sense
of helplessness all alone for so long!

01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:00.567
But it's too much for me...

01:12:05.239 --> 01:12:05.614
Large-sized Garbage
Handling Fee Coupon

01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:15.708
Oh, Kurisu-chan! Too-too-roo!

01:12:15.916 --> 01:12:16.417
Hello.

01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:20.421
Say, would you consider this
furniture or audio equipment?

01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:22.798
--You're throwing it out?
--Yeah.

01:12:23.007 --> 01:12:27.261
Daru-kun asked me to put stickers
on all the oversized garbage.

01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:28.887
Oh.

01:12:30.264 --> 01:12:33.058
You seem kind of down.

01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:34.727
Yes...

01:12:34.935 --> 01:12:37.438
But it can't be helped.

01:12:37.646 --> 01:12:39.732
Mm...

01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:42.860
Say, Kurisu-chan.

01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:50.409
Do you know what "Okarin" means?

01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:56.331
For some reason, that word pops
into my head whenever I'm in the lab.

01:12:56.540 --> 01:13:00.002
When I'm cleaning up,
when I'm making my costumes,

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:03.047
and even when I'm eating.

01:13:09.845 --> 01:13:11.346
No...

01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:14.975
Ku <i>risu-chan?</i>

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.691
Makise-san!

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.985
Urushibara-san.

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:27.863
You're training, I see.

01:13:28.072 --> 01:13:28.906
Yes!

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:31.200
I do 100 swings a day,

01:13:31.408 --> 01:13:34.036
to unleash the true power
of the Supernatural Sword Samidare!

01:13:34.244 --> 01:13:37.289
That's a neat name! Did you pick it?

01:13:37.498 --> 01:13:38.499
Yes!

01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:42.252
E-Err, no...

01:13:43.295 --> 01:13:49.802
Umm, I feel like someone
might've given me this katana.

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.932
Stop...

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:01.939
Virus, meow!

01:14:02.147 --> 01:14:05.234
<i>Getting Owned by Paris-tan, FTW‘.!</i>

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:06.443
8to 0.

01:14:06.652 --> 01:14:09.029
What a one-sided game!

01:14:11.156 --> 01:14:13.450
Oh! You came too, Kurisu-chan!

01:14:13.659 --> 01:14:14.743
What's everyone doing here?

01:14:14.952 --> 01:14:17.454
They were having
Rai-Net battles at May Queen,

01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:21.208
when Faris-chan suddenly wanted
to battle our lab's representative!

01:14:21.416 --> 01:14:24.461
--Meow.
--Faris-tan summoned me after
I finished my part-time job interview.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.088
--Faris-tan summoned me after
I finished my part-time job interview.

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:30.551
- Job?
--Yeah. I'm hoping I can
at least pay the lab's rent.

01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:33.011
I think we should keep the lab after all.

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:34.972
Hashida...

01:14:35.681 --> 01:14:37.724
But somethings off, meow.

01:14:37.933 --> 01:14:39.977
The lab's representative used to be way...

01:14:40.185 --> 01:14:41.145
Better?

01:14:41.353 --> 01:14:45.315
No, worse, meow. So bad it was scary.

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:49.611
But I also feel like
he was way livelier, meow!

01:14:52.239 --> 01:14:54.241
--Real-life combat?
--No, meow!

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.493
But, he, like...

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:58.620
Daru-nyan! Do a pose, meow!

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.747
L-Like this?

01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:04.376
No, meow!

01:15:04.585 --> 01:15:06.545
I think I understand.

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.422
There's another person.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:10.382
Another person?

01:15:10.591 --> 01:15:13.302
He's not here, but...

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:15.512
Déjé vu.

01:15:15.721 --> 01:15:17.389
It's really true...

01:15:17.598 --> 01:15:20.392
Déjé vu <i>isn't</i> the brain producing delusions.

01:15:20.601 --> 01:15:23.645
Déjé vu is the Reading Steiner ability itself.

01:15:23.854 --> 01:15:28.192
It's the memories of countless other yous
on countless other world lines.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.568
They come together...

01:15:29.776 --> 01:15:33.488
All the memories come together...
and make who you are now.

01:15:33.697 --> 01:15:36.033
The one and only you.

01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:39.703
Your intense obnoxiousness could
never truly vanish from anyone's mind.

01:15:39.912 --> 01:15:41.371
Even if we <i>think</i> we've forgotten you,

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:45.459
we'll have memories of you
somewhere inside us, always.

01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:49.296
I tried to give up.

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:52.257
I tried many times to forget.

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:55.052
I thought it was pointless,
even with a time machine.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:16:00.182
Even so, I feel like everyone
is telling me not to forget.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.808
l~\

01:16:02.017 --> 01:16:05.312
Ku-nyan? What's wrong, meow?

01:16:05.520 --> 01:16:06.772
lam...

01:16:08.649 --> 01:16:10.984
...Hououin Kyouma!

01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:14.238
My goal is to transform
the world's ruling structure!

01:16:14.446 --> 01:16:15.822
For that aim,

01:16:16.031 --> 01:16:18.825
the Future Gadget Laboratory
is tasked with creating inventions

01:16:19.034 --> 01:16:22.537
that will unleash chaos upon this world!

01:16:25.499 --> 01:16:28.001
What? Did the heat make you go crazy?

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:29.962
But I've seen this before, meow.

01:16:30.170 --> 01:16:30.963
Stop...

01:16:31.171 --> 01:16:34.883
Hold thy tongue, super haxOr!
You're speaking to a mad scientist!

01:16:35.092 --> 01:16:37.094
That's your made-up character!

01:16:37.302 --> 01:16:39.471
Huh? What am I saying?

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.556
Don't remember...

01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:44.476
Mayuri! Give me the intelligent
drink of choice individuals!

01:16:44.685 --> 01:16:45.644
Good evening!

01:16:45.852 --> 01:16:47.437
--Oh?
--Rukako!

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:49.648
“Keep Practi <i>~</i>
“Enng. Y°our swinging!
‘R'9ht!

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:52.276
Indeed. Through training,
you must unleash

01:16:52.484 --> 01:16:55.237
the hidden power in
the Supernatural Sword Samidare.

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:56.863
Right!

01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:58.031
Don't...

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:01.118
I can't save him...

01:17:01.326 --> 01:17:02.786
Here, Kurisu-chan!

01:17:02.995 --> 01:17:05.289
Dk Pepper!

01:17:07.082 --> 01:17:11.295
But, you aren't Hououin Kyouma, you know.

01:17:11.503 --> 01:17:14.339
Hououin Kyouma is...

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:18.302
Hououin Kyouma is...

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:22.681
...Okabe Rintaro.

01:17:22.889 --> 01:17:26.101
Okabe Rintaro...

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:28.020
Oka... Rin...

01:17:28.228 --> 01:17:30.814
Okarin? Somehow I know that name.

01:17:31.023 --> 01:17:32.774
It's right on the tip of my tongue...

01:17:32.983 --> 01:17:36.153
Okarin? Do you mean Kyouma, meow?

01:17:36.361 --> 01:17:38.280
Okabe-kun...

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:41.700
Oka-- Kyouma-san!

01:17:42.492 --> 01:17:44.536
Okarin...

01:17:44.745 --> 01:17:46.371
Okarin...?

01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:49.458
I'm not sure who he is,

01:17:49.666 --> 01:17:56.089
but my heart feels really warm
whenever I say that name.

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:58.717
I wonder why...

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:13.648
People are always focused on something
important other than themselves...

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:16.651
...just as you observed and watched over us.

01:18:20.113 --> 01:18:22.949
Even if you're gone from this world,

01:18:23.158 --> 01:18:25.952
even if there are no signs of you here,

01:18:26.161 --> 01:18:30.874
people's feelings <i>do</i> transcend world lines.

01:18:31.083 --> 01:18:32.918
But...

01:18:35.796 --> 01:18:41.009
You'll pass by here soon, just like last time.

01:18:41.218 --> 01:18:45.514
I've come this far,
but I don't know what I should do.

01:18:50.018 --> 01:18:52.479
What can I do to save you?

01:18:52.687 --> 01:18:56.691
Even if feelings transcend world lines,
events still converge.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:59.444
So what can I possibly do?

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:01.905
Won't anything I do be pointless?

01:19:02.114 --> 01:19:04.533
Caught without an umbrella?

01:19:08.412 --> 01:19:11.915
You're still sopping wet!
Don't you need an umbrella?!

01:19:16.711 --> 01:19:21.049
I don't know anything about Okabe.

01:19:21.258 --> 01:19:23.552
All I do know is in bits and pieces.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.388
Just a few memories from this world line

01:19:26.596 --> 01:19:30.851
and my déjé vu memories
from other world lines.

01:19:32.436 --> 01:19:34.563
Before this, I never would've believed

01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:38.150
in time machines or changing past events.

01:19:38.358 --> 01:19:41.069
Because I never had anything
I so badly wanted to protect.

01:19:43.321 --> 01:19:46.408
But now I've finally found something.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:51.288
I still haven't told him how I feel at all.

01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:57.752
Every time I saw him, I just got stubborn
and bickered for no good reason...

01:19:57.961 --> 01:20:01.840
I never got to tell him
what I really wanted to say.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:10.474
I've been that way since I was a child.

01:20:10.682 --> 01:20:13.852
I acted like I could do
everything on my own...

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:18.732
I put up walls around myself,
saying I didn't need anyone's help...

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.442
What a horrible kid.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.488
It's no wonder my dad hated me.

01:20:24.696 --> 01:20:30.494
But, in truth,
I did want someone to talk to me.

01:20:30.702 --> 01:20:37.167
Someone to say, "I'm watching,"
even if I was the only one there.

01:20:59.147 --> 01:21:01.399
Are you lost?

01:21:06.404 --> 01:21:11.576
There's a girl I've known since I was little...

01:21:11.785 --> 01:21:15.497
She's been depressed for a long time.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:19.042
I don't know what I should say to her...

01:21:19.251 --> 01:21:24.214
I wonder if there's nothing I can do...

01:21:34.724 --> 01:21:40.730
Do you know who Hououin Kyouma is?

01:21:40.939 --> 01:21:42.566
Hououin?

01:21:42.774 --> 01:21:47.362
He's a scientist. But no ordinary one.

01:21:47.571 --> 01:21:51.366
He's a <i>mad</i> scientist. As mad as they get.

01:21:51.575 --> 01:21:56.997
He acted crazy,
and everyone always ridiculed him.

01:21:57.205 --> 01:22:02.544
No one ever believed him,
his research, or his discoveries.

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:06.965
But what he discovered
was something no one else could see.

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:09.217
Only he could see it.

01:22:09.426 --> 01:22:12.887
He realized it brought people
pain and suffering...

01:22:13.096 --> 01:22:16.182
...and that it could even destroy the world.

01:22:16.391 --> 01:22:20.353
So he struggled desperately
to protect everyone.

01:22:20.562 --> 01:22:24.399
He kept fighting, to save the world.

01:22:25.358 --> 01:22:30.822
And, in the end, he managed
to save everyone dear to him.

01:22:31.031 --> 01:22:35.285
But not a single person knows that he did.

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:39.331
He remained a mad scientist forever.

01:22:39.539 --> 01:22:43.710
He remained a laughingstock forever.

01:22:48.423 --> 01:22:51.718
That's a sad story.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:56.931
Really? I think it's a lovely one.

01:23:01.353 --> 01:23:03.647
Now, go on.

01:23:03.855 --> 01:23:07.484
I'm sure there's someone waiting for you.

01:23:20.872 --> 01:23:22.457
Mayuri!

01:23:25.293 --> 01:23:27.170
Okarin?

01:23:27.379 --> 01:23:29.964
I won't let you get taken away.

01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:32.342
You're my hostage!

01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:35.553
You're my living sacrifice
for my human experiments!

01:24:03.498 --> 01:24:05.083
CRT
VVOFKShOp

01:24:06.584 --> 01:24:08.044
Sanpo Beef Bowls

01:24:38.533 --> 01:24:44.080
If you're ready,
I'll now outline Operation Norn.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.633
What are you gawking at?! Pervert!

01:25:05.185 --> 01:25:07.854
What...

01:25:08.062 --> 01:25:11.274
...are you doing here?

01:25:14.778 --> 01:25:16.863
I didn't come here.

01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:24.120
You're trying to return to
the Steins Gate world line, from this one.

01:25:24.329 --> 01:25:25.413
Think back.

01:25:25.622 --> 01:25:30.460
When you wandered across
the world lines, I was always with you.

01:25:30.668 --> 01:25:34.047
Mayuri, Hashida, Faris-san,

01:25:34.255 --> 01:25:37.926
Urushibara-san,
Kiryuu-san, and Amane-san...

01:25:38.134 --> 01:25:41.304
...haven't forgotten you, either!

01:25:41.513 --> 01:25:47.018
You're pretty conceited to think you're
propping up the world all by yourself!

01:25:47.227 --> 01:25:48.812
Don't forget.

01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:52.065
No matter what world line
you're on, you aren't alone.

01:25:52.273 --> 01:25:54.901
No matter where you are, I'll find you.

01:25:55.109 --> 01:25:57.237
I'll keep observing you,

01:25:57.445 --> 01:26:01.574
just as you kept observing me.

01:26:16.548 --> 01:26:20.176
All right. If that's the choice of Steins Gate.

01:26:21.678 --> 01:26:23.805
Now then, Christina.

01:26:24.013 --> 01:26:26.099
Would you kindly return it to me?

01:26:29.018 --> 01:26:32.230
My first kiss.

01:26:34.899 --> 01:26:36.484
Nope.

01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:50.081
<i>When we look back at
things someday in the future,</i>

01:26:52.584 --> 01:26:58.006
<i>you'll always be here, smiling</i>

01:27:02.927 --> 01:27:08.641
<i>Amid the cruel passage of time</i>

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:13.313
<i>we continually sought something:</i>

01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:23.781
<i>an invisible light trapped within passing worlds</i>

01:27:25.408 --> 01:27:35.585
<i>I could never be open
with the one I had a special love for</i>

01:27:35.793 --> 01:27:41.507
<i>Every single day that passed</i>

01:27:41.716 --> 01:27:47.388
<i>converted my confusion into a periodic pattern</i>

01:27:47.597 --> 01:27:53.686
<i>When we look back at
things someday in the future,</i>

01:27:53.895 --> 01:27:58.816
<i>you'll always be here, smiling</i>

01:27:59.025 --> 01:28:08.826
<i>People's combined feelings
are what create a world line</i>

01:28:09.035 --> 01:28:15.124
<i>No rain can ever drench
the feelings of trust we share</i>

01:28:15.333 --> 01:28:20.421
<i>For the observers in the sky,</i>

01:28:20.630 --> 01:28:28.262
<i>this sky is proof that there's a tomorrow</i>

01:28:49.033 --> 01:28:54.998
<i>Ever since we met that day,
we've been here searching</i>

01:28:55.206 --> 01:29:00.128
<i>for something that's important</i>

01:29:00.336 --> 01:29:10.138
<i>We know the significance found
in time's indifferent flow</i>

01:29:10.346 --> 01:29:16.436
<i>No matter how far the two become separated,</i>

01:29:16.644 --> 01:29:21.774
<i>for the observers in the sky,</i>

01:29:21.983 --> 01:29:30.366
<i>this sky is proof that there's a tomorrow</i>
