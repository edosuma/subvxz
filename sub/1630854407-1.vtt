00:19.587 --> 00:23.725
<i>Currently
it's 72 right now, with
those winds on the calm side.</i>

00:23.758 --> 00:27.161
<i>It's just a glorious
Tuesday morning here
in Pittsburgh.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:28.696
<i>We can see around us...</i>

00:28.730 --> 00:30.865
<i>Dear Zoe.</i>

00:30.899 --> 00:33.367
<i>Reports of a tie-up
on I-79 north of the city...</i>

00:33.401 --> 00:36.270
<i>I have memories
of you from before
you were even born.</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:38.338
<i>I just remember us
sitting around the kitchen,</i>

00:38.372 --> 00:40.274
<i>arguing about
what your name should be...</i>

00:42.142 --> 00:43.778
<i>...and how that somehow
made you a real person</i>

00:43.812 --> 00:45.613
<i>before I even saw you face.</i>

00:48.148 --> 00:52.186
<i>Mom told us Zoe means life,
that this name would
protect you...</i>

00:52.219 --> 00:54.021
Zoe!

00:54.054 --> 00:56.858
<i>but nothing could have
protected you that day,</i>

00:56.891 --> 00:59.794
<i>except me, and I didn't.</i>

01:01.930 --> 01:05.265
<i>-I was just an ordinary girl
with ordinary problems.
-Mom!</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:08.202
<i>Divorced parents,
annoying stepdad,</i>

01:08.235 --> 01:09.737
<i>lousy grades.</i>

01:09.771 --> 01:12.105
<i>Kind of lousy friends.</i>

01:12.139 --> 01:15.577
<i>But you,
you were extraordinary,</i>

01:15.610 --> 01:17.946
<i>and I loved being
your big sister.</i>

01:17.978 --> 01:20.981
<i>I'd get pissed if someone
said you were only
my half-sister,</i>

01:21.014 --> 01:23.418
<i>because you were never
half of anything.</i>

01:23.451 --> 01:25.854
<i>...as the towers
of the World Trade Center...</i>

01:25.887 --> 01:28.222
<i>But then you
left us</i>

01:28.255 --> 01:30.758
<i>on the worst day
imaginable.</i>

01:30.792 --> 01:33.260
<i>It's right on top of us right now.
We gotta get out of the way!</i>

01:33.293 --> 01:35.763
<i>On the news,
they've been saying all year</i>

01:35.797 --> 01:37.632
<i>that history
will forever be divided</i>

01:37.665 --> 01:42.102
<i>between what happened
before 9/11 and after.</i>

01:42.135 --> 01:44.271
<i>But that erases your death,</i>

01:44.304 --> 01:48.242
<i>because you died on that day
but not because of that day.</i>

01:48.275 --> 01:51.044
<i>You died because of me.</i>

01:53.681 --> 01:57.384
Along the way, you might
experience anxiety,

01:57.418 --> 02:00.688
depression,
anger, even guilt.

02:00.722 --> 02:04.124
Whenever you feel the urge,
write down in these notebooks

02:04.157 --> 02:05.927
anything you want
to say or to remember.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.362
Why would we want
to remember any of this?

02:12.901 --> 02:15.703
- Tessie!
- Tess, get back here!

02:17.906 --> 02:21.108
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.610
Come here.

02:26.213 --> 02:28.550
That was rude.

02:28.583 --> 02:31.719
I'm done talking, and I won't
write in any stupid notebook.

02:31.753 --> 02:35.122
So, you guys,
you can enjoy your trip
down "recovery road,"

02:35.155 --> 02:36.624
but I'm not going.

02:36.658 --> 02:38.459
You gonna tell her that?

02:42.396 --> 02:45.833
We need to do it
to get better.

02:45.867 --> 02:47.301
Come on, sweetie.

03:39.454 --> 03:43.190
<i>Guilt and grief
are a powerful combination.</i>

03:43.223 --> 03:45.927
<i>They make you question things
you used to do before.</i>

03:45.960 --> 03:48.730
Less time on makeup, more time on breakfast.
Come on!

03:48.763 --> 03:52.399
<i>Like, how I'd get
into disturbingly
in-depth discussions with Em</i>

03:52.433 --> 03:54.535
<i>about how you'd always
stink up the bathroom.</i>

03:54.569 --> 03:56.269
Ohhh!

03:56.303 --> 03:58.606
<i>And how I'd pick
my daily fight with David</i>

03:58.640 --> 04:01.876
<i>about wanting
to go to art school
instead of college.</i>

04:01.909 --> 04:07.048
<i>And my weekly fight with Mom
about not wanting to spend
time over at my dad's.</i>

04:07.081 --> 04:11.753
<i>Or how I used to gossip
about boys with my friends
on the bus</i>

04:11.786 --> 04:18.158
<i>and suffer through long,
boring days at school...</i>

04:18.191 --> 04:21.095
<i>when I'd much rather
have just stayed home
and played with you all day.</i>

04:21.129 --> 04:22.597
Oh, come here!

04:22.630 --> 04:24.398
Ohh! Mmm!

04:24.432 --> 04:26.100
<i>Then we could have all gone
to the market...</i>

04:26.134 --> 04:28.069
Oh, you're gonna
have a funnel cake.

04:28.102 --> 04:30.337
<i>...where I could have
flirted with cute Justin.</i>

04:30.370 --> 04:32.607
<i>And you could have flirted
with cute Justin.</i>

04:32.640 --> 04:35.777
And now to bag
this sack of potatoes!

04:35.810 --> 04:38.245
Motatoes!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.915
<i>Maybe if I did
something different,</i>

04:40.948 --> 04:42.784
<i>things would be different.</i>

04:42.817 --> 04:44.852
<i>Or maybe not.</i>

04:44.886 --> 04:46.888
<i>I honestly
just don't know anymore.</i>

04:48.823 --> 04:52.325
<i>Because at the end
of every goddamn day,</i>

04:52.359 --> 04:54.128
<i>reality set in...</i>

04:56.564 --> 04:59.701
<i>...and I was just left
with before...</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:03.438
<i>and after.</i>

05:06.541 --> 05:08.042
<i>October.</i>

05:08.076 --> 05:10.445
<i>November.</i>

05:10.478 --> 05:12.447
<i>December.</i>

05:12.480 --> 05:14.048
<i>Words that meant
the same thing--</i>

05:15.817 --> 05:17.518
<i>after.</i>

05:20.755 --> 05:24.192
Hey, Em.
What are you doing in here?

05:25.693 --> 05:26.928
I like the wallpaper.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.598
Can I see?

05:35.368 --> 05:37.004
What is it?

05:37.038 --> 05:41.075
Santa lying face down, crying.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.489
Em needs Christmas.

05:54.522 --> 05:56.457
We don't have
a tree or anything.

05:59.594 --> 06:00.962
Seriously?

06:04.699 --> 06:07.535

09:14.588 --> 09:17.124
Hiya, Tess.
How's your mother?

09:17.158 --> 09:18.526
She's good, I guess.

09:36.277 --> 09:38.612
So, uh, what can I get ya?

09:38.646 --> 09:42.984
We need a pound of turkey
and some ham.

09:48.823 --> 09:50.157
Okay.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.231
Hey, Tess, wait up.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.335
Hi. How are you?

10:01.369 --> 10:02.970
I'm good.

10:04.105 --> 10:06.540
I'm great, actually.

10:07.942 --> 10:09.510
Would you give this to Elly?

10:09.543 --> 10:11.278
I-- I mean your mom.

10:11.312 --> 10:13.848
It's her monthly statement.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.196
Your boyfriend
gave this to me.

10:32.467 --> 10:34.702
-Is that my dress?
-No, take it. Really.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.472
It's beautiful.
It's poetry, honestly.
It's amazing.

10:37.506 --> 10:39.441
Poetry? What are you...?

10:48.082 --> 10:51.118
-It's not what you think.
-Or it's exactly
what I think it is.

10:51.152 --> 10:53.320
No. You-- honey, you--

10:53.354 --> 10:54.822
Don't touch me!

10:54.855 --> 10:56.624
Actually, I think it's great.

10:56.657 --> 10:59.193
Really. I hope you guys
are just so happy together,

10:59.226 --> 11:02.497
because I didn't think
you gave a shit about
anyone, to be honest.

11:02.531 --> 11:04.231
Especially not
your own family.

11:04.265 --> 11:06.501
-Let me see.
-No.

11:06.535 --> 11:09.504
Oh! Okay, wait, no, I get it.
This is, like, your thing,
right?

11:09.538 --> 11:13.307
It's your thing because,
yeah, well, we met David
in a grocery store.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.510
And we met Justin
in a grocery store.

11:15.544 --> 11:19.013
-So, what, is Justin
gonna be my new dad?
-Give me that! Stop it!

11:19.046 --> 11:22.249
This has nothing
to do with Zoe!

11:23.884 --> 11:25.953

Hey, Tessie girl.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.424
What are you--
what are you doing here?

14:16.458 --> 14:17.925
Uh...

14:17.958 --> 14:21.496
Wait. Can you give me
one minute?

14:21.529 --> 14:22.664
-One, just...
-Yeah.

14:22.697 --> 14:23.732
-Yeah? Yeah?
-Yeah.

14:23.764 --> 14:25.165
One second. Okay.

14:26.900 --> 14:27.935
You gotta go.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.671
My kid's here.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.439
You got a kid?

14:31.473 --> 14:33.441
I'll call you later.

14:33.475 --> 14:36.243
You gotta be kidding me.

14:49.624 --> 14:50.858
What's going on?

14:50.891 --> 14:52.860
Is your mom okay?

14:52.893 --> 14:54.763
-Um...
-Did you come here for a visit?

14:54.795 --> 14:56.598
Yeah, sort of.

14:56.631 --> 14:59.434
Wait. When's your bedtime?

15:00.602 --> 15:02.369
Can I come in?

15:02.404 --> 15:04.305
- Get out!
- Of course you can.

15:04.338 --> 15:06.807
- Yo, bro!
- Get a real job!

15:15.784 --> 15:17.452
Show's over. Okay?

15:17.485 --> 15:19.654
Go right in.
Got a new litter of puppies.

15:19.688 --> 15:21.822
You know, just be careful.
They're gonna get
real excited.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.033
Would you just pipe down?

15:37.137 --> 15:39.840
You remember Tinnie girl?

15:42.876 --> 15:44.345
Badass, right?

15:45.814 --> 15:47.014
Totally.

15:50.317 --> 15:51.586
You remember your old room?

15:53.822 --> 15:55.956
-I got it.
-Thanks.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.358
Okay.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.702
Tessie!

16:13.575 --> 16:15.610
What do you think?

16:17.344 --> 16:18.713
It's amazing.

16:20.482 --> 16:22.216
Ah, the ladies!

16:22.249 --> 16:25.352
Yeah, I found those
in a box under the bed.

16:25.386 --> 16:27.455
You, uh...
you still play with them?

16:30.525 --> 16:32.960
I just, you know,
I've been keeping it nice

16:32.993 --> 16:35.362
for the day when you
might finally come over.

16:35.396 --> 16:37.231
I just, uh...

16:39.434 --> 16:41.536
I didn't think you'd, uh...

16:41.569 --> 16:43.203
come over
on your own free will

16:43.237 --> 16:45.573
or without calling,

16:45.607 --> 16:47.241
or in the middle of the night.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.214
You hungry?

16:54.248 --> 16:55.784
I can order us pizza.

17:04.859 --> 17:07.394
I'm really glad you're here.

17:09.697 --> 17:11.800
-Yeah, me too.
-Okay.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.343
<i>After the break,
we'll be talking</i>

17:23.377 --> 17:25.547
<i>with Secretary of State
Colin Powell.</i>

17:25.580 --> 17:28.248
<i>- Our guest is truly
an inspiration.</i>

17:28.282 --> 17:30.017
<i>Colin Powell
is our country's first</i>

17:30.050 --> 17:32.754
<i>African-American
National Security Advisor</i>

17:32.787 --> 17:35.956
<i>and the first
African-American chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,</i>

17:35.989 --> 17:38.460
<i>and the first African-American
Secretary of State.</i>

17:38.493 --> 17:41.094
<i>Before all of that...</i>

17:41.128 --> 17:44.131
<i>...he was a four-star
general with a long
and distinguished career.</i>

17:44.164 --> 17:46.568
<i>After retiring
from the military,</i>

17:46.601 --> 17:49.804
<i>he built one of America's
largest volunteer
organizations</i>

17:49.838 --> 17:52.474
<i>that supports more than
ten million children...</i>

18:00.582 --> 18:02.717
<i>- Yeah?
-  -You are in such big trouble!</i>

18:02.750 --> 18:04.251
<i>-Mom, Mom, Mom!
-You are so grounded!</i>

18:04.284 --> 18:06.688
<i>-Jeez, pull it together.
-What?</i>

18:06.721 --> 18:09.156
<i>You run off
in the middle of the night
without telling me?</i>

18:09.189 --> 18:12.292
<i>You had me so worried.
Tess, you are coming home
right now.</i>

18:12.326 --> 18:16.798
No, no, I'm not,
because you'd have to get off
the couch to make me, so...

18:16.831 --> 18:19.333
Nick, are you home? Nick?

18:19.366 --> 18:20.969
Open up the door!

18:21.001 --> 18:23.805
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:23.838 --> 18:26.106
-What are you doing?
-Elly, What are you doing?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.175
Why is she here?!
Why, why?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.644
-She just came here.
-Why?

18:29.677 --> 18:31.412
'Cause she came here.
Calm down!

18:31.446 --> 18:33.448
-Hey, let her go! Go get her.
-Listen!

18:33.481 --> 18:36.451
No, you listen! Elly's
the custodial parent, not you.

18:36.484 --> 18:38.252
Huh? Not you!

18:38.285 --> 18:41.456
You are contractually obligated
to send Tess home!

18:41.489 --> 18:45.493
Look, I know
youse been through hell,

18:45.527 --> 18:47.361
and I have no idea
how you're coping.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.464
-I really don't.
-Mm-hmm.

18:49.497 --> 18:54.469
But I know that that kid
in there is obviously
hurting too.

18:54.502 --> 18:56.004
Come on.

18:56.036 --> 18:57.438
You're scaring her.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.953
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.590
We were just--
we were just talking.

19:17.492 --> 19:20.160
Give Tess some space.

19:20.193 --> 19:25.500
David, give yourself
some space.

19:25.533 --> 19:27.902
For the weekend at least.

19:31.039 --> 19:34.141
I'm just letting everything
fall apart, uh...

19:34.174 --> 19:35.375
Nah, man.

19:36.678 --> 19:38.713
The world just blew up.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.885
And nobody could stop it.

20:06.474 --> 20:07.575
Thanks.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.981
Good night.

20:25.627 --> 20:26.794
You need a name, huh?

20:28.763 --> 20:32.634
Something that's gonna help you
grow big and strong, yeah?

20:32.667 --> 20:33.701
Oh!

20:37.572 --> 20:40.575
Jesus Christ.
Hey, turn that shit off!

20:52.754 --> 20:55.723
<i>Pirates are
wrapping up a good summer
and first month.</i>

20:55.757 --> 20:57.425
<i>They had 13 wins
against eight losses</i>

20:57.458 --> 20:59.393
<i>going into
today's double header...</i>

20:59.427 --> 21:01.663
-Dad, I did something wrong.
-Already? You just got here.

21:01.696 --> 21:03.798
Gave this little guy a name.

21:03.831 --> 21:05.466
-Ow! Ugh!
-Let me guess.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.935
-Chompers.
-Colin Powell.

21:07.969 --> 21:10.772
You named that pup
after the Secretary of State?

21:12.272 --> 21:13.941
I know who he is.

21:13.975 --> 21:17.078
-Can we keep him?
-You may keep him.

21:17.111 --> 21:19.447
You gotta take care of him.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.417
That means you gotta spend
a weekend here every now
and again, all right?

21:22.450 --> 21:23.985
Deal.

21:24.018 --> 21:26.319
Man. Takes a puppy
to get you to come here.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.089
Look at that freakin' omelet.

21:28.122 --> 21:29.924
-Yeah, that's a freakin' omelet.
-Yeah.

21:29.957 --> 21:32.927
Better than that damn nebnose
I used to slave for.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.495
You used to?

21:37.397 --> 21:41.201
Here's the thing about
working for the man, Tessie.

21:43.171 --> 21:46.708
They don't have a clue,
but they're in charge.

21:46.741 --> 21:48.843
And you're stuck under them.

21:48.876 --> 21:50.545
Right?

21:50.578 --> 21:53.715
In this world,
you've gotta be self-starting.

21:53.748 --> 21:56.918
You gotta take what you want,
be a go-getter.

22:14.035 --> 22:16.471
-You workin' for Nick?
-Yeah.

22:16.504 --> 22:18.106
Now and again.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.810
Hey, hurry up!

22:22.844 --> 22:24.311
We ain't got all day!

22:25.413 --> 22:27.014
Yo, Nick!

22:29.784 --> 22:31.886
Won't Tinnie miss her puppies?

22:31.919 --> 22:34.589
Nah, she'll be happy
to have them out of the house.

22:34.622 --> 22:36.524
She's already starting
to get annoyed.

22:36.557 --> 22:38.358
I thought they'd kill for them.

22:38.391 --> 22:42.096
Sure. Don't mean she want them
hanging around forever.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.443
Hey-ey-ey! Huh?

22:55.476 --> 22:58.880
Let me take a look at you!

22:58.913 --> 23:02.016
You are finger-lickin' good!

23:05.920 --> 23:07.387
All right, Trav.

23:07.421 --> 23:09.322
Pretty sure he's talking to you.

23:13.661 --> 23:15.963
Are you makin' fun of me?

23:15.997 --> 23:19.133
Well, if I were, I'd start
with that God-awful shit
you crank out at night.

23:19.167 --> 23:23.204
So, you don't even know me,
and you're already
trashing my music.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.673
All right. Cool, cool, cool.

23:27.108 --> 23:28.276
I'm Tess.

23:32.446 --> 23:34.015
I'm Jimmy.

23:35.183 --> 23:36.584
That little one friendly?

23:47.094 --> 23:48.162
Hi.

23:50.131 --> 23:54.435
So, Tess, you run
a construction firm?

23:54.468 --> 23:57.438
That's your shitty truck
out there with your name on it?

23:57.471 --> 23:59.106
What are you driving,
a Porsche?

23:59.140 --> 24:01.475
I'm not what you would
call legal to drive.

24:01.509 --> 24:03.277
Well, how come?
You're old enough.

24:03.311 --> 24:06.981
Let's just say, the last time
I got pulled over,

24:07.014 --> 24:11.252
if I'd have had my license,
they would have taken it
from me, yet again.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.688
Well, see, if I ever
get my license,

24:13.721 --> 24:17.258
I'm not gonna treat it
like some lame-ass boyfriend
I'm not really into.

24:17.291 --> 24:19.060
You got me there.
Come on.

24:21.195 --> 24:23.598
So, how old are you, Tess?

24:24.866 --> 24:26.334
Seventeen.

24:26.366 --> 24:30.171
Well, 16, but, um, 17 soon.

24:30.204 --> 24:33.074
-August 26th.
-Is that why you wear
so much makeup?

24:37.645 --> 24:39.447
You're real smooth,
you know that?

24:39.480 --> 24:41.381
I didn't mean it like that.

24:41.415 --> 24:44.919
I just meant you don't
really need it, that's all.

24:49.857 --> 24:51.025
You want a beer?

24:51.058 --> 24:52.560
What?

24:52.593 --> 24:54.595
You heard me?

24:59.500 --> 25:01.669
Come on, ump,
get a new pair of glasses.

25:01.702 --> 25:03.070
Come on!

25:03.104 --> 25:04.238
Hey.

25:07.441 --> 25:09.844
Giles, you overpriced,
West Coast piece of--

25:09.877 --> 25:12.747
Hit the goddamn ball!

25:12.780 --> 25:16.050
Put it back, and tell him
to get the hell out of here.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.052
What?
Dad, come on, he's harmless.

25:18.085 --> 25:20.454
- Put it back.
- Dad!

25:20.488 --> 25:22.023
I don't want you
hanging around with him.

25:22.056 --> 25:24.258
-Why not?
-Because I said so.

25:24.292 --> 25:26.394
What am I supposed
to do, hang out with you
all the time?

25:26.427 --> 25:30.564
Finally! Finally
he gets a hit! Yes!

25:30.598 --> 25:32.667
Uh, sure, yeah.
You want to sit down?

25:32.700 --> 25:34.869
You can hang out with Tinnie
and I and watch the Buccos?

25:34.902 --> 25:36.337
-No.
-You can invite
your friends over.

25:36.370 --> 25:38.039
They're from
Murdoch Farms, Dad.

25:38.072 --> 25:40.274
They wouldn't be
caught dead in Braddock.

25:40.308 --> 25:42.710
Dad, what's the big deal?

25:42.743 --> 25:44.679
'Cause your mom
would freak out.

25:44.712 --> 25:46.948
I thought you were cool,
but you're the worst!

25:46.981 --> 25:48.582
Why are you yelling?

25:50.985 --> 25:52.853
I heard all of that.

25:52.887 --> 25:55.890
I don't know
what his problem is.

25:55.923 --> 25:57.792
Me?

25:59.593 --> 26:01.862

Thank you so much,

26:48.175 --> 26:51.512
for encouraging us to worship
the God of our salvation.

26:51.545 --> 26:53.280
Love is an action.

26:53.314 --> 26:56.317
On 9/11, many men and women
rushed into places

26:56.350 --> 26:58.919
that they otherwise
would not have gone into.

26:58.953 --> 27:02.457
They gave selflessly
of themselves.

27:02.491 --> 27:04.191
Will you stand?

27:04.225 --> 27:06.093
We need to sing out.

27:06.127 --> 27:07.928
They have given their lives

27:07.962 --> 27:10.197
in sacrifice for the lives
of the people,

27:10.231 --> 27:13.601
and therefore
we cannot forget!

27:16.471 --> 27:17.905
<i>Tessie!</i>

27:50.638 --> 27:54.175
<i>Dad's driving me

27:54.208 --> 27:56.811
So, what, I mean, is he
going to give you a ride home?

27:56.844 --> 27:58.480
No, I'm going to be
hitchhiking back.

27:58.513 --> 28:00.881
Please don't talk
about stuff like that.

28:00.915 --> 28:02.517
<i>Mom, it's fine.</i>

28:02.551 --> 28:05.886
<i>Well, you know
that I worry.</i>

28:05.920 --> 28:10.157
Em keeps asking me
when you're coming home, so...

28:10.191 --> 28:11.225
<i>when are you coming home?</i>

28:11.258 --> 28:13.060
I need some time, okay?

28:13.094 --> 28:15.229
<i>-I have to clear my head.
-I mean, how much time?</i>

28:15.262 --> 28:17.398
I mean,
when are you gonna be home?

28:17.432 --> 28:19.733
I don't know, like a week?

28:19.767 --> 28:21.602
<i>-A month?
-A month!</i>

28:21.635 --> 28:23.572
A month?

28:27.975 --> 28:30.377
Look, if-if...

28:30.412 --> 28:32.246
if this is about...

28:33.482 --> 28:35.349
Justin...

28:35.382 --> 28:37.651
it was nothing.

28:39.653 --> 28:41.622
It's none of my business.

28:41.655 --> 28:44.358
He was just someone
who I could be with

28:44.391 --> 28:47.462
and I could talk to
or laugh

28:47.496 --> 28:50.264
<i>for a couple minutes,</i>

28:50.297 --> 28:54.235
to-- to actually feel good.

28:54.268 --> 28:55.970
Like I said,
it's not my business.

29:03.277 --> 29:04.645
Come on,
gather around.

29:04.678 --> 29:06.448
Story time.

29:10.951 --> 29:12.286
Guys, come on.

29:13.622 --> 29:14.722
Hi.

29:16.591 --> 29:18.092
Thank you.

29:31.005 --> 29:32.873
You doing okay?

29:34.175 --> 29:36.076
Are you coming back home?

29:39.847 --> 29:41.849
You left your notebook.

29:41.882 --> 29:45.186
There's paper everywhere.

29:51.225 --> 29:53.694
So, why did you come here?

29:53.727 --> 29:55.863
Because I missed you.

29:58.533 --> 30:00.067
And I, um...

30:01.735 --> 30:05.773
I wanted you to know
that me leaving,

30:05.806 --> 30:07.676
it had nothing to do
with you.

30:14.215 --> 30:15.816
Do you want a ride home?

30:15.849 --> 30:18.285
You learned to drive?

30:18.319 --> 30:21.088
Yeah.

30:27.328 --> 30:30.164
I see you lookin'.

30:30.197 --> 30:31.999
You like my truck?

30:32.032 --> 30:34.168
I could fall out.

30:34.201 --> 30:36.671
- Actually, it's like
a ride at Kennywood.

30:36.705 --> 30:38.205
Oh, yeah,
we're hooked together.

30:38.239 --> 30:40.040
Mm-hmm.

30:40.074 --> 30:44.512
You know, we could pick you up
every day after school.

30:44.546 --> 30:45.946
Would you like that?

30:47.415 --> 30:48.483
Hmm... Yeah?

30:55.189 --> 30:56.890
Thank you.

31:05.799 --> 31:08.302
So you don't forget
what she looks like.

31:11.105 --> 31:12.674
Is Mom asleep?

31:14.241 --> 31:15.477
You gonna be okay?

31:17.278 --> 31:18.747
Same drill tomorrow?

31:19.947 --> 31:22.182
Just don't tell Mom
or David.

31:22.216 --> 31:23.718
Love you.

31:23.752 --> 31:25.085
Love you.

31:33.227 --> 31:34.596
You comin', Red?

31:43.638 --> 31:45.939
-Will you teach me
how to drive?
-Oh.

31:45.973 --> 31:48.576
Those are scary words.

31:48.610 --> 31:51.879
It's right up there with, uh,
"Where do babies come from?"

31:51.912 --> 31:52.946
Hmm.

32:00.588 --> 32:02.757
What the hell are you doing?

32:02.791 --> 32:06.093
Huh? I can't hear you.
It's too loud!

32:06.126 --> 32:08.262
I said, what are you doing?

32:08.295 --> 32:11.131
I don't know
what you're trying
to say to me right now. Bye!

32:15.804 --> 32:19.006
Oh, my God,
just turn the music off!

32:20.307 --> 32:21.743
Hey.

32:21.776 --> 32:23.645
-Hi.
-I wanna show you something.

32:29.149 --> 32:31.619
No, absolutely not!
No, no!

32:31.653 --> 32:32.920
Oh, my God!

32:34.988 --> 32:36.458
I'm fine. Oh, my God!

32:36.491 --> 32:38.258
Jimmy, are you serious?

32:38.292 --> 32:41.962
Uh, you're insane.
This is insane.

32:41.995 --> 32:44.532
Oh, my God, okay, be careful.

32:44.566 --> 32:47.201
-Hey again.
-Hi.

32:47.234 --> 32:49.370
Uh, what are you doing?

32:49.404 --> 32:51.205
If my dad
finds out that you're here,
we're both screwed.

32:51.238 --> 32:52.873
Don't trip.

32:54.241 --> 32:58.379
Um... I know that guy.

32:58.413 --> 33:00.280
-Are you wearing makeup?
-Yeah.

33:00.314 --> 33:02.149
-"Guyliner," so they call it.
-Hmm.

33:02.182 --> 33:04.452
I figured, don't knock it
till I try it, so...

33:04.486 --> 33:06.286
Yeah, yeah, it's not bad,
actually.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.222
- Thank you.
- Yeah, mm.

33:08.255 --> 33:10.124
Your eyebrow's messy, though.

33:10.157 --> 33:11.892
Now it is.

33:13.595 --> 33:16.831
Um, so... where did
you go to school?

33:16.865 --> 33:19.801
Butler High, and I still go.

33:19.834 --> 33:22.837
-But I've been taking
the scenic route.
-Oh, my God.

33:22.871 --> 33:25.305
Okay. That's enough of that.

33:27.941 --> 33:30.344
Yo, this is amazing.

33:30.377 --> 33:31.846
Oh, my God.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.516
So, um, the scenic route,

33:34.549 --> 33:37.585
that includes being home
a month before school ends?

33:37.619 --> 33:42.189
Funny story, my dad sent me
to live with my grandmama,

33:42.222 --> 33:43.924
'cause he's an asshole.

33:43.957 --> 33:47.194
She caught me smoking weed,
sent me back here.

33:47.227 --> 33:48.897
'Cause apparently
I'm an asshole.

33:50.765 --> 33:52.600
Speaking of which...

33:54.436 --> 33:56.270
you wanna fire this up?

33:57.806 --> 34:00.508
Screw your lame-ass
gateway drugs.

34:05.979 --> 34:08.850
Sounds to me like
you've never smoked before.

34:15.723 --> 34:17.124
What's that?

34:18.893 --> 34:21.962
It's my zero gravity pendant.

34:21.995 --> 34:24.031
You know, zero gravity.

34:24.064 --> 34:25.767
Spacemen and weightlessness.

34:25.800 --> 34:27.936
Yeah, no, I know
what zero gravity is.

34:27.968 --> 34:29.904
-I'm gonna graduate on time.
-Hmm.

34:29.938 --> 34:33.106
I'm just asking,
why do you wear it?

34:33.140 --> 34:35.142
'Cause it's sexy.

34:35.175 --> 34:37.445
Oh. That's debatable.

34:37.479 --> 34:39.379
All right.

34:39.414 --> 34:42.316
So, suburban girl.

34:42.349 --> 34:44.384
What are you doing
here in Braddock?

34:44.419 --> 34:46.153
I'm looking at a punk ass.

34:47.622 --> 34:50.625
You're obviously
from somewhere better, though.

34:50.658 --> 34:51.926
So, what's up?

34:55.295 --> 34:56.664
Smart boy.

34:56.698 --> 34:58.466
Now, get the hell
out of my room.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.133

-Just, bothering everybody.

36:14.074 --> 36:16.076
Weed Wacker Enterprises.

36:16.109 --> 36:18.546
Tess.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.180
Okay. Yeah.

36:20.213 --> 36:23.150
Just give me 20, huh?
All right.

36:24.552 --> 36:26.386
Uh, I gotta go see some people.

36:26.421 --> 36:28.056
Hopefully about a job?

36:28.121 --> 36:29.757
Yes.

36:29.791 --> 36:31.391
You gonna be okay
getting home?

36:31.426 --> 36:33.193
Yeah, sure.

36:33.226 --> 36:35.730
Oh, you know what, I'll call
my teen prostitute pals.

36:35.763 --> 36:38.566
Turn a few tricks on the way,
shoot some heroin.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.134
Yeah, okay, or you could
do none of that.

36:48.543 --> 36:49.844
Hey, girlie.

36:51.913 --> 36:54.549
You're Nick's kid, ain't ya?

36:54.582 --> 36:56.283
Yeah.

36:56.316 --> 36:59.353
I seen you. Naked.

37:02.590 --> 37:04.859
You was little then.

37:04.892 --> 37:06.761
Mmmm.

37:06.794 --> 37:10.197
You ain't so little no more.

37:13.835 --> 37:16.704
Um, we sold all the puppies.

37:16.738 --> 37:19.540
I ain't here for a puppy.

37:21.943 --> 37:25.913
Oh! Where you going,
scaredy-cat?

37:25.947 --> 37:28.750
The money's for your daddy.

37:28.783 --> 37:30.718
He ever let you, uh...

37:30.752 --> 37:33.888
...sample the product?

37:37.692 --> 37:40.227
Travis!

37:40.260 --> 37:42.563
What the hell!

37:45.700 --> 37:47.502
- Who was that?
- Nobody.

37:47.535 --> 37:49.504
Oh, really?
I wish nobody

37:49.537 --> 37:51.304
dropped off money
for me every once in a while.

37:51.338 --> 37:53.608
No idea
what you're talking about.

37:53.641 --> 37:57.011
So, you lost your job
at the diner and now
you're selling drugs?

37:57.045 --> 37:59.147
Drugs? So I sell
a little weed here and there

37:59.179 --> 38:01.449
to some friends
for some personal use.

38:01.482 --> 38:02.950
Nothing hard.

38:02.984 --> 38:04.619
Soft, hard, call it
what you want,

38:04.652 --> 38:07.320
Dad, it's still drugs
and it's still illegal!

38:07.354 --> 38:10.925
In the war on drugs,
your old man is far
from the front lines.

38:10.958 --> 38:13.628
I am just a conscious objector
doing my part.

38:13.661 --> 38:16.263
-Conscientious.
-Exactly!

38:16.296 --> 38:19.600
And in my world,
if a guy works hard all day

38:19.634 --> 38:22.202
and he wants to get baked
before supper, so be it.

38:22.235 --> 38:25.506
Speaking of, burgers tonight.

38:25.540 --> 38:28.375
-What happened
to the food truck idea?
-It's still moving forward.

38:28.409 --> 38:32.113
Okay, I just got to get
a little more money
to fix the truck.

38:32.146 --> 38:34.048
Isn't that what
the construction business
was for?

38:34.082 --> 38:35.883
That whole thing's
a racket, okay?

38:35.917 --> 38:38.619
Kickbacks, favors,
no room for real growth.

38:38.653 --> 38:40.188
But you know what?

38:40.220 --> 38:42.790
It was a blessing,
because in that madness,

38:42.824 --> 38:44.525
that's when it all
came to me.

38:44.559 --> 38:46.728
I could be my own boss. Right?

38:46.761 --> 38:49.664
I could make my own hours
driving around the neighborhood,

38:49.697 --> 38:53.167
spreading happiness to everyone,
like an ice-cream man,

38:53.201 --> 38:55.302
but with weed.

38:55.335 --> 38:57.370
Ice-cream man?
Dad, what are you
talking about?

38:57.405 --> 38:59.006
Listen to me,
it's amazing, right?

38:59.040 --> 39:01.175
You know how
the ice-cream truck has, like...

39:01.209 --> 39:03.978
ding-di-di-ding-ding
ding-ding, right,
and everybody goes nuts?

39:04.011 --> 39:06.481
I play the Dead from my truck,
and all these stoners

39:06.514 --> 39:08.315
come running out
of their house, right?

39:08.348 --> 39:10.818
But, like, slow,
when I say running, right?

39:10.852 --> 39:13.221
Like, slow, they're like,
"Yo, dude, dude, slow down!"

39:13.253 --> 39:16.157
Like, "Slow down, dude!
I broke my flip-flop!"

39:16.190 --> 39:18.993
And I'm telling you,
it's working

39:19.026 --> 39:22.295
because by the end of the year,
I'm gonna have that truck
in tiptop shape.

39:29.103 --> 39:31.739
-Well, aren't you scared?
-Of what?

39:31.773 --> 39:34.942
-Getting caught.
-I'm more scared of being broke.

39:34.976 --> 39:38.679
Well, you know, there's
this thing I heard about,
it's called a job.

39:38.713 --> 39:40.347
It ain't that easy.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.550
Dad, it is that easy--
you work, they pay.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.786
Not what I'm worth.

39:44.819 --> 39:45.987
All right?

39:48.089 --> 39:51.759
Tess, I want to be able
to give you things,
to buy you stuff.

39:51.793 --> 39:56.898
You've got a DVD, a satellite,
a big grill outside.

39:56.931 --> 39:58.833
How much is in
my college account?

40:04.438 --> 40:08.308
News flash:
I'm a shitty father.

40:10.912 --> 40:13.781
No. No, Dad, you're not.

40:13.815 --> 40:15.817
But in prison, yeah.

40:15.850 --> 40:18.886
In prison, you'd be
a really shitty father.

40:26.160 --> 40:28.896
Hey, ladder boy.

40:31.098 --> 40:32.567
Incoming!

40:36.304 --> 40:39.173
Not really my type,
but thank you.

40:39.207 --> 40:41.309
Get over here.

40:50.618 --> 40:53.154
All right, so hit it.

40:53.187 --> 40:55.289
Get it in your lung...

40:55.323 --> 40:57.725
and let it out real slow.

40:59.961 --> 41:01.028
Yeah.

41:03.865 --> 41:05.132
I feel nothing.

41:05.166 --> 41:07.068
Nothing, you total stud?

41:08.870 --> 41:10.638
Yeah, nothing, swear to God.

41:10.671 --> 41:13.373
Hmm. Just wait.

41:17.645 --> 41:19.847
-There should be a film...
-Mm-hmm.

41:19.881 --> 41:22.049
<i>...called Lord of the Fleas.</i>

41:22.083 --> 41:25.820
And it's just,
it's about a bunch of fleas

41:25.853 --> 41:28.990
fighting for dominance
on top of a dog.

41:29.023 --> 41:30.992
What?

41:31.025 --> 41:32.526
I'd watch that.

41:32.560 --> 41:35.029
Colin Powell would hate it.

41:37.899 --> 41:40.201
It's weird, I feel like...

41:40.234 --> 41:41.869
I feel like I'm really smart.

41:41.903 --> 41:43.804
Mm-hmm. That's the weed.

41:43.838 --> 41:46.807
It, like, heightens
who you actually are.

41:46.841 --> 41:48.376
-Oh.
-Yeah.

41:48.409 --> 41:50.645
So you think I'm smart?

41:50.678 --> 41:52.880
Girl, you laying
here with me.

41:52.914 --> 41:54.916
That makes you a genius.

41:59.086 --> 42:01.122
You want to do this
again sometime?

42:05.693 --> 42:08.029
Can I kiss you good night?

42:08.062 --> 42:09.130
Yes.

42:17.138 --> 42:19.507
Good night, Tess DeNunzio.

42:19.540 --> 42:20.908
Good night.

42:30.618 --> 42:33.422
So, Em, how was
your last day at school?

42:35.656 --> 42:38.125
Hey!

42:38.159 --> 42:41.028
You know, if you're gonna
give me the silent treatment,

42:41.062 --> 42:43.432
I think I deserve to know why.

42:43.464 --> 42:46.934
This is the only way
I get to see you.

42:46.968 --> 42:48.469
What do you mean?

42:48.502 --> 42:50.304
You've been picking me up
every day,

42:50.338 --> 42:52.139
but school's over now.

42:53.408 --> 42:54.475
Hey.

42:59.013 --> 43:01.983
-Dad, keep going.
-I can't just drive off
with his kid.

43:02.016 --> 43:03.484
He doesn't know
we've been picking up Em.

43:03.517 --> 43:04.986
- It's okay.
- Daddy!

43:05.019 --> 43:06.620
-Tessie, just--
-Dad, I can't be here!

43:06.654 --> 43:08.789
What the hell
are you doing?

43:08.823 --> 43:11.392
Come here.
I got you, baby,
I got you, huh?

43:11.426 --> 43:13.761
I don't ever want her
in this thing again,
do you hear me?

43:13.794 --> 43:15.730
The door is wide open!

43:15.763 --> 43:17.798
I know, I've been meaning
to fix that damn thing, David.

43:17.832 --> 43:20.401
- I got this.
- What about you?

43:20.435 --> 43:22.770
Thinking about coming home
anytime soon?

43:22.803 --> 43:25.172
Calling your mother?
You could call her, you know.

43:25.206 --> 43:28.142
- Now is not the best time.
-  -Now is not the best time?

43:30.277 --> 43:32.747
David, David, David, she just
ain't ready to come back yet.

43:32.780 --> 43:35.316
She's doing good,
she's doing really, really good.

43:35.349 --> 43:38.085
Oh!

43:38.119 --> 43:41.322
Hey, Tess DeNunzio!
What are you doing?

43:41.355 --> 43:43.324
Move over. Move over.

43:43.357 --> 43:47.628
What is wrong with you?
You could have killed someone!

43:51.198 --> 43:54.602
- Dad, just go.
- It's okay, it's okay.

43:54.635 --> 43:56.270
Dad, go!

44:04.479 --> 44:07.982
When you try
that bullshit, you know what
that makes me look like?

44:08.015 --> 44:10.051
Dad, just leave it!

44:10.084 --> 44:13.020
I'm going to tell you
something, young lady.

44:13.054 --> 44:15.589
If you plan on staying here,
no more free rides.

44:15.623 --> 44:18.626
You're gonna start redding up
your room and you're gonna
get a freaking job!

44:20.227 --> 44:21.362
Tess!

44:24.499 --> 44:27.868
Cheers to me.

44:32.339 --> 44:33.774
I can get you a job.

44:35.510 --> 44:37.344
What kind of job?

44:39.046 --> 44:41.816
What kind of job?

44:43.518 --> 44:46.187
So you hold
the cup under, push the button,

44:46.220 --> 44:47.588
out it comes.

44:47.621 --> 44:49.690
Even a princess like you
can do it.

44:49.723 --> 44:51.826
<i>Welcome to Kennywood!
- Gates are open.</i>

44:51.859 --> 44:54.195
Here they come.
Quick, put this on.

44:54.228 --> 44:56.163
Uh, do I have to wear this?

45:30.965 --> 45:34.536
You know me and Jimmy
go way back, right?

45:34.569 --> 45:36.538
I've known him
practically all my life.

45:38.139 --> 45:39.807
So don't break his heart.

45:39.840 --> 45:42.943
I'm just hoping
he doesn't break mine.

45:45.179 --> 45:46.615
Yo, yo!

45:48.450 --> 45:50.684
Is it cool
if this one knocks off early?

45:53.687 --> 45:56.056
I guess princess
gets what princess wants.

45:56.090 --> 45:57.324
Thanks.

45:57.358 --> 45:59.126
Hey.

46:00.761 --> 46:02.531
All right, you do that.

46:04.698 --> 46:06.468
Bye!

46:08.669 --> 46:14.409
They're dropping 18 stories
at 75 miles an hour.

46:16.177 --> 46:18.112
I can ride it for free
late at night.

46:18.145 --> 46:20.114
Which means you can too.

46:23.618 --> 46:25.487
Looks like falling
out of the sky.

46:25.520 --> 46:28.523
Exactly.
Yo, you gotta try it.

46:28.557 --> 46:31.358
No! No, there's no way
I'm going up on that thing.

46:45.172 --> 46:46.774

46:46.807 --> 46:50.010

-Huh?

47:36.957 --> 47:38.926
You feeling naughty?

47:38.959 --> 47:41.862
You know, my brain's
telling me to say no.

47:41.895 --> 47:43.130
All right.

47:48.035 --> 47:50.004
What? Oh, my God!

47:56.444 --> 47:59.079
How did you find this place?

48:00.715 --> 48:05.052
I was walking on the ledge,
being a punk ass.

48:05.085 --> 48:06.521
I fell in.

48:07.821 --> 48:08.956
Silver lining.

48:08.989 --> 48:11.358
It's amazing.

48:22.336 --> 48:26.073
These guys, they just
line up and look at her.

48:26.106 --> 48:28.142
It's so juvenile.

48:28.175 --> 48:30.578
So, does your hot new friend
have a hot mom?

48:30.612 --> 48:34.315
Oh, my God, Dad, no.
Eww. Gross.

48:34.348 --> 48:36.884
Besides, don't you
already have a girlfriend?

48:36.917 --> 48:41.121
Blonde, half-naked,
snuck out of here one night
about a month ago?

48:41.155 --> 48:43.591
Hmm?

48:43.625 --> 48:46.827
She doesn't mind you have
a photo of you and mom
on display, does she?

48:48.630 --> 48:50.297
The light's usually off.

48:51.766 --> 48:53.233
-Hmm!
-You asked.

48:53.267 --> 48:55.269
Nope.

49:01.443 --> 49:03.645
-Hey, supper, 15.
-All right.

49:03.678 --> 49:06.648
Oh, call your mom.

49:06.681 --> 49:07.948
You promised.

49:07.981 --> 49:09.517
And you promised
you'd get a job,

49:09.551 --> 49:11.151
so, really, it's your turn.

49:11.185 --> 49:15.457
Relax.
I'm working some angles.

49:15.490 --> 49:17.625
You're always
working some angles.

49:27.401 --> 49:28.503
Hi.

49:30.538 --> 49:31.606
That bad?

49:33.808 --> 49:36.210
-You're gonna be real proud
of your old man.
-No way!

49:36.243 --> 49:38.480
-You got it?
-Hold your horses,
hold your horses.

49:38.513 --> 49:41.014
I still gotta pass muster
with the top chef,
and then they said

49:41.048 --> 49:43.685
I gotta come back sometime
next week and cook with him
like a test.

49:43.718 --> 49:45.820
You'll be amazing, come here.

49:45.854 --> 49:47.354
I'm proud of you.

49:47.388 --> 49:49.858
See, going legit
isn't that bad, huh?

49:49.923 --> 49:51.659
We'll see.

49:51.693 --> 49:54.128
So, how about we call
your mom and Em and David,

49:54.161 --> 49:56.296
we invite them over for
Fourth of July barbecue, right?

49:56.330 --> 49:57.898
I could practice
on all of them.

49:57.931 --> 50:00.401
-It's a great idea.
-They wouldn't come.

50:00.435 --> 50:03.203
No, no, no, it would be
real nice, and then we'll invite
your friends from school.

50:03.237 --> 50:05.906
-You haven't seen them in weeks.
-They wouldn't come either.

50:05.939 --> 50:08.075
Look, you invite
who you want to invite, okay?

50:08.108 --> 50:10.344
-How about we go celebrate?
-Yeah.

50:10.377 --> 50:12.814
-Primanti's?
-Like you even had to ask.

50:12.847 --> 50:14.516
Primanti's!

50:37.439 --> 50:38.740
Thank you.

50:39.908 --> 50:42.009
- That's good?
- Yeah.

50:48.282 --> 50:50.350
Are you still in love
with mom?

50:54.087 --> 50:56.624
I knew I should have
put that photo away.

50:56.658 --> 50:59.126
Then why don't you?

51:07.000 --> 51:09.169
'Cause it's the happiest
I've ever been.

51:13.908 --> 51:15.375
King of the world.

51:17.579 --> 51:19.481
Prettiest girl in my arms.

51:22.349 --> 51:23.618
And you on the way.

51:38.466 --> 51:40.267
So you seeing anybody?

51:40.300 --> 51:43.404
No, Ma,
I'm taking a little breather

51:43.438 --> 51:45.940
with the ladies
while Tess is here.

51:45.974 --> 51:49.343
Gotta get my act together,
focus on being a parent.

51:49.376 --> 51:51.946
Yeah?
How is that working out?

51:51.980 --> 51:56.016
Oh, lordy,
she looks just like
her mother at that age.

51:56.049 --> 51:58.118
Oh, hi, how are you?
Thanks for coming.

51:58.151 --> 51:59.821
Headstrong like her too.

51:59.854 --> 52:02.089
That Elly O'Connor
was a real piece of work.

52:02.122 --> 52:04.759
She never appreciated
where she came from.

52:04.792 --> 52:06.761
Couldn't get out of here
fast enough.

52:10.063 --> 52:12.266
Hi, thanks for coming.

52:13.635 --> 52:15.369
Are those new clothes?

52:15.402 --> 52:17.337
This one seems headed
the opposite direction.

52:18.740 --> 52:20.742
Keep your eye on things.

52:34.656 --> 52:36.824
-Hi.
-What's up, Nick?

52:36.858 --> 52:38.960
I don't remember inviting you.

52:38.993 --> 52:41.228
Oh, no, Dad.
Dad, it's cool, I invited him.

52:41.261 --> 52:44.364
I told him to dress nice
and bring something.

52:44.398 --> 52:45.800
It's apple.

52:45.833 --> 52:47.869
Looks delicious,
thank you, Jimmy.

52:49.069 --> 52:50.705
Bro, chill out.

52:50.738 --> 52:53.841
She invited me, so...
what am I gonna do?

52:53.875 --> 52:56.310
I couldn't say no.
It would have been suspicious.

52:57.579 --> 53:01.049
Nah. You chill, Jimmy.
In fact, get out.

53:01.081 --> 53:02.750
Whoa, Dad, be nice.

53:08.856 --> 53:09.924
Jimmy.

53:18.098 --> 53:19.634
Nice one, Dad.

53:21.234 --> 53:22.870
Hey, Jimmy, stop!

53:22.904 --> 53:24.906
Please slow down!
Oh, my--

53:30.745 --> 53:35.083
Tess, this...
this is not gonna work.

53:35.115 --> 53:38.118
Not as long as
your father thinks that
I'm not good enough for you.

53:38.151 --> 53:41.723
I-- I admit it, this afternoon
didn't go according to plan,

53:41.756 --> 53:43.825
but we just
have to keep trying.

53:43.858 --> 53:46.293
For what? You got to go
back to the burbs,

53:46.326 --> 53:48.195
I gotta go back
to my grandmama's crib,

53:48.228 --> 53:50.431
so maybe we should
just call it right now.

53:52.667 --> 53:54.102
Is that what you want?

54:08.181 --> 54:10.183
I want you, Tess.

54:23.330 --> 54:27.234
<i>I knew full well I didn't
deserve to be so happy,</i>

54:27.267 --> 54:30.170
<i>but in the moment, it seemed
convenient to just go with it.</i>

54:36.276 --> 54:38.446
<i>July melted into August.</i>

54:43.618 --> 54:45.620
Jimmy!

54:45.653 --> 54:47.021
Jim...

54:54.962 --> 54:56.864
Shit.

55:03.336 --> 55:04.906
I'm sorry.

55:06.140 --> 55:08.910
And for that,
you come over here.

55:10.678 --> 55:13.181
Yeah, just take it
step by step.

55:13.213 --> 55:14.816
There you go,
you're almost there.

55:14.849 --> 55:16.884
-Take your time.
-Yeah, but you have to help me.

55:16.918 --> 55:19.520
Hey, look,
you're doing this crab walk.

55:19.554 --> 55:22.156
-I told you, face down, ass up.
-What am I supposed to do?
I don't want to look down!

55:22.190 --> 55:25.126
Come on, just take my hands.

55:25.159 --> 55:27.995
- Hmm-mm.
- Oh, duck your head.

55:28.029 --> 55:30.230
See? Easy, huh?

55:30.263 --> 55:31.799
-I hate you.
-Yeah, whatever.

55:33.701 --> 55:35.503
Dude, damn!

55:35.536 --> 55:38.005
You got sexy-ass pajamas
on right now.

55:38.039 --> 55:40.174
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

55:40.208 --> 55:42.744
Oh, my God,
your room is crazy.

55:42.777 --> 55:44.579
-Thank you.
-Shut up.

55:44.612 --> 55:47.081
Ehh, "You park
like an asshole."

55:47.115 --> 55:48.916
Somebody left that
on my dad's car

55:48.950 --> 55:50.885
like two years ago.

55:50.918 --> 55:53.421
Cracked me up when I saw it.

55:53.454 --> 55:56.591
Kind of like my window, Tess?

55:56.624 --> 55:58.860
-I keep telling you
to get a phone.
-Mm.

55:58.893 --> 56:00.795
All the good ones
are over here, though.

56:04.065 --> 56:05.233
Hmm.

56:08.536 --> 56:12.272
"Think of me when you're
visiting the big cat house.
Mom."

56:13.441 --> 56:16.276
Oh. A field trip to the zoo?

56:16.309 --> 56:17.578
Mm-hmm.

56:19.981 --> 56:22.216
That's really sweet.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.485
Yeah, it was.

56:25.987 --> 56:28.422
She, uh, died that day.

56:29.657 --> 56:31.259
The day she wrote that.

56:37.231 --> 56:38.331
I'm sorry.

56:40.134 --> 56:41.636
That's life, right?

56:47.241 --> 56:49.977
How did you-- how did you
know to keep the note?

56:53.481 --> 56:55.216
She...

56:55.249 --> 56:58.219
she had to go
to the hospital that morning.

56:58.252 --> 57:00.955
We didn't know
what was wrong with her.

57:00.988 --> 57:02.957
Um...

57:02.990 --> 57:05.660
I was so...

57:05.693 --> 57:08.663
I was so worried
that whole day,

57:08.696 --> 57:11.364
I couldn't eat the lunch
that she had packed me.

57:12.667 --> 57:14.635
My stomach was turning knots.

57:17.004 --> 57:18.472
So, when I got home...

57:18.506 --> 57:20.107
oh, shit...

57:20.141 --> 57:23.311
I was hungry.
I was so damn hungry.

57:23.343 --> 57:27.982
So I sat right here,
I ate lunch.

57:28.015 --> 57:30.585
When I got to the bottom,
I found that.

57:34.956 --> 57:36.624
But it's your turn, though.

57:36.657 --> 57:38.993
You gotta tell me
some really sad shit now.

57:45.365 --> 57:46.767
Zoe!

57:49.871 --> 57:51.539
Tell me more about your mom.

57:57.712 --> 57:59.447
She gave me this.

58:36.717 --> 58:39.020
- Come on, what you doing?
- Excuse me, just hang on.

58:39.053 --> 58:40.755
Employee coming through.

58:44.025 --> 58:46.160
Take me up.

58:46.193 --> 58:49.263
No. You can't cut the line.

58:49.297 --> 58:51.032
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

58:51.065 --> 58:53.935
Besides, you're not
even tall enough to ride.

58:53.968 --> 58:55.069
Dick.

58:56.405 --> 58:57.905
You really want to ride?

58:59.573 --> 59:01.342
Yes.

59:01.375 --> 59:04.211
No, no, no, no, no!

59:04.245 --> 59:06.514
Take me down, take me down!
No, I can't do it.

59:06.547 --> 59:09.283
- Baby, we're good.
-No, I'm scared of heights, please.

59:09.317 --> 59:11.285
-Trust me, I got you.
-No, I don't care.

59:11.319 --> 59:13.621
Just tell them
to take me down!

59:13.654 --> 59:16.357
Can't turn back now,
we're already a hundred
some odd feet up.

59:16.390 --> 59:18.392
No, I don't care,
please, just make them stop.

59:18.427 --> 59:20.294
-Please!
-Stop like that?

59:20.328 --> 59:22.296
Open your eyes.

59:22.330 --> 59:24.098
-Tess, open your eyes.
-No!

59:24.131 --> 59:25.566
Come on, open your eyes!

59:25.599 --> 59:27.601
Hmm-mm.

59:27.635 --> 59:30.471
That's what you wanted.
We here now.

59:30.504 --> 59:32.139
-Open your eyes.
-No!

59:32.173 --> 59:34.675
Look, you gotta look at this.
Open your eyes.

59:35.810 --> 59:37.412
I love you.

59:37.446 --> 59:39.380
Open your eyes.

59:41.949 --> 59:44.618
What did you say?
What-- what did you say
just now?

59:44.652 --> 59:46.787
-What did you say just now?
-No, what did you just say?

59:46.821 --> 59:49.323
I said, "Open your eyes,"
you gotta see...

59:49.357 --> 59:50.958
-lemonade stand and...
-No!

59:50.992 --> 59:52.427
...there's Vicky right there.

59:52.461 --> 59:54.862
No, look,
I'm serious.

59:58.165 --> 1:00:00.768
I said--
I said I love you.

1:00:00.801 --> 1:00:02.636
I said I love you, Tess.

1:00:02.670 --> 1:00:04.872
Oh, my God, I love you!

1:00:06.207 --> 1:00:07.341
I love you too.

1:00:07.375 --> 1:00:09.110
Then let's fly.

1:00:14.348 --> 1:00:18.152
- Oh, my God!
- Wheeee!

1:00:18.185 --> 1:00:20.489
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

1:00:28.829 --> 1:00:31.032
Hey, Tessie.
Your mom's on the phone.

1:00:46.147 --> 1:00:47.449
Tess DeNunzio!

1:00:52.019 --> 1:00:54.188
Outside now!

1:00:55.589 --> 1:00:57.691
You stay away from him,
you hear me?

1:00:57.725 --> 1:00:59.960
But I'm almost 17.
I'm not a little girl anymore.

1:00:59.994 --> 1:01:02.897
-Yeah, well, it's my house
so it's my rules.
-My body, my rules.

1:01:02.930 --> 1:01:06.233
What? Gee, your bod-- No!
No, I'm putting my foot down.

1:01:06.267 --> 1:01:08.202
If I catch you two
together again,

1:01:08.235 --> 1:01:10.704
I'm going to rip that stupid
piercing out of his face

1:01:10.738 --> 1:01:13.174
and puncture
his entire body with it.

1:01:13.207 --> 1:01:14.909
Oh, my God, I hate you!

1:01:14.942 --> 1:01:16.478
Yeah? Good.

1:01:16.511 --> 1:01:18.012
Good.

1:01:19.346 --> 1:01:20.482
Good.

1:01:20.515 --> 1:01:22.716
I hated my parents too.

1:01:26.187 --> 1:01:30.024
Oh, shit.
Your mom's still
on the phone.

1:01:30.057 --> 1:01:32.827
<i>Tess, do I not get
to see you on your birthday?</i>

1:01:32.860 --> 1:01:35.830
I'm not thinking
that far ahead, Mom. Okay?

1:01:35.863 --> 1:01:37.566
No, it's not okay,

1:01:37.598 --> 1:01:39.534
- because you're there...
- and I'm here,

1:01:39.568 --> 1:01:41.068
and we're supposed
to be together.

1:01:41.102 --> 1:01:44.038
<i>-Mom.
-You're everything to me,</i>

1:01:44.071 --> 1:01:46.340
the one thing
I couldn't lose,

1:01:46.373 --> 1:01:49.110
and now I'm--
and now I'm losing you.

1:01:51.112 --> 1:01:53.448
I can't lose you both.

1:01:53.482 --> 1:01:55.249
I can't.

1:01:55.282 --> 1:01:57.586
But, Mom, Mom,
you're not losing me.

1:01:58.919 --> 1:02:00.455
Things have been...

1:02:00.489 --> 1:02:02.424
<i>okay.</i>

1:02:02.457 --> 1:02:04.959
I got a summer job and...

1:02:04.992 --> 1:02:07.094
<i>Dad's been great, actually.</i>

1:02:07.128 --> 1:02:09.630
Your dad's been great?

1:02:09.663 --> 1:02:13.134
Okay, great,
well, I always knew

1:02:13.167 --> 1:02:15.402
that you would run off
to him one day,

1:02:15.437 --> 1:02:18.939
but I did not know that
it would be for stability.

1:02:18.973 --> 1:02:21.942
So have fun. Oh.

1:02:43.764 --> 1:02:45.966
Hey, Tessie girl.

1:02:47.502 --> 1:02:49.870
Um...

1:02:51.606 --> 1:02:54.175
I never done this before.

1:02:54.208 --> 1:02:56.677
I don't know what
I'm doing.

1:02:56.710 --> 1:02:58.513
I realized, uh...

1:03:01.348 --> 1:03:03.585
I ain't never asked you
what's going on.

1:03:05.853 --> 1:03:08.557
I know you had to clear out
of there for a while.

1:03:10.391 --> 1:03:11.859
You want to talk about it?

1:03:19.668 --> 1:03:21.570
'Cause you can, you know.

1:03:23.871 --> 1:03:25.706
Anytime with me.

1:03:32.079 --> 1:03:34.449
Your mom and me...

1:03:34.482 --> 1:03:36.551
we, uh...

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:42.122
we managed
to do one thing right.

1:03:53.435 --> 1:03:56.070
Tess! Oh, my God!

1:03:56.103 --> 1:03:58.239
Where have you been?
We haven't seen you in weeks.

1:03:58.272 --> 1:04:01.175
-Yeah, well, um...
-Hey, a little help over here.

1:04:01.208 --> 1:04:03.043
Oh. Do you work here?

1:04:03.077 --> 1:04:06.247
-Yeah, I got a summer job.
-Eww.

1:04:06.280 --> 1:04:08.182
Actually, it's really fun.

1:04:08.215 --> 1:04:11.586
Get to go on rides for free
and eat cotton candy.

1:04:11.620 --> 1:04:14.888
Besides, my dad,
he insisted that I get a job
while I'm staying with him.

1:04:14.922 --> 1:04:16.658
You're living in Braddock?

1:04:16.691 --> 1:04:18.526
Hey, stop babbling
and get your ass over here.

1:04:18.560 --> 1:04:20.060
Listen, guys,
it was really nice to see you.

1:04:20.094 --> 1:04:22.096
Um, let's catch up soon.

1:04:22.129 --> 1:04:26.333
Sure. And we can gossip about
what a bitch your coworker is.

1:04:27.968 --> 1:04:30.871
Ashley, your family
may have a lot of money,

1:04:30.904 --> 1:04:33.173
but it doesn't mean
you have to be such a snob.

1:04:44.051 --> 1:04:45.119
Here.

1:04:48.822 --> 1:04:50.492
Thanks, princess.

1:04:52.026 --> 1:04:54.462
Thanks, Vicky,
see you tomorrow.

1:04:56.498 --> 1:04:58.533
Dad.

1:04:58.566 --> 1:05:01.770
What-- what happened?
Why aren't you at
the restaurant?

1:05:01.802 --> 1:05:03.772
I couldn't do it.

1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:08.677
Tess, you wouldn't understand.

1:05:11.345 --> 1:05:12.547
Try me.

1:05:17.585 --> 1:05:18.787
I was going.

1:05:20.954 --> 1:05:25.092
I was, uh, all dressed
and ready,

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:26.594
and...

1:05:26.628 --> 1:05:28.563
I caught sight of myself
in the mirror,

1:05:29.464 --> 1:05:31.131
I realized that...

1:05:34.602 --> 1:05:36.970
I'm not the guy.

1:05:37.004 --> 1:05:38.339
Not the guy?

1:05:38.372 --> 1:05:40.140
Dad, what guy?

1:05:40.174 --> 1:05:43.944
I was the guy
a million years ago.

1:05:43.977 --> 1:05:47.114
But now I just don't know
what to do anymore.

1:05:47.147 --> 1:05:49.316
I don't know how
to keep a job.

1:05:49.350 --> 1:05:51.653
I don't know how
to support my family.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:56.658
I don't know how to make
something more of my life.

1:05:58.727 --> 1:06:00.528
My stupid friggin' life.

1:06:12.239 --> 1:06:13.441
Hello?

1:06:13.475 --> 1:06:15.477
<i>Tess, your...</i>

1:07:19.106 --> 1:07:21.108
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

1:07:21.141 --> 1:07:23.578
What you mean, nothing?
You was just driving the truck.

1:07:25.413 --> 1:07:27.080
My mother
tried to kill herself.

1:07:29.417 --> 1:07:32.386
She tried, like...
she gonna be okay?

1:07:32.420 --> 1:07:35.857
Yes, yes, but you have no idea,
so don't pretend that you do.

1:07:35.890 --> 1:07:37.926
What you mean, I don't know?
My mom died.

1:07:37.958 --> 1:07:39.461
-Died.
-Yeah.

1:07:39.494 --> 1:07:42.931
Of a disease.
It's not the same thing.

1:07:42.963 --> 1:07:44.965
What do you mean,
it's not the same thing?

1:07:46.434 --> 1:07:48.536
What was in the lunchbox
on that last day?

1:07:48.570 --> 1:07:50.605
What did she pack for you?

1:07:50.638 --> 1:07:52.807
What difference
does it make?!

1:07:52.841 --> 1:07:56.076
The last thing your mother
ever did was take care of you!

1:07:56.109 --> 1:07:57.946
My mother doesn't give
a shit about me.

1:07:57.978 --> 1:07:59.647
She'd rather be dead
than be a mother.

1:07:59.681 --> 1:08:02.282
So, no, no,
you don't understand.

1:08:22.369 --> 1:08:24.304
Yo, Vicky, what's up?

1:08:28.041 --> 1:08:29.611
Are you two ever
gonna make up?

1:08:29.644 --> 1:08:31.311
Shut up.

1:08:31.345 --> 1:08:33.313
Jesus, you've been
a bitch for, like, weeks.

1:08:33.347 --> 1:08:36.316
You know, maybe you could ask
if anything was wrong.

1:08:36.350 --> 1:08:39.587
Okay, sorry.

1:08:39.621 --> 1:08:41.756
Is there anything wrong?

1:08:44.526 --> 1:08:46.226
It's none of your business.

1:09:02.075 --> 1:09:04.311
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, baby.</i>

1:09:04.344 --> 1:09:07.314
<i>-Are you home?
-Yeah, I was sleeping.</i>

1:09:07.347 --> 1:09:09.349
<i>I had some, uh...</i>

1:09:09.383 --> 1:09:11.452
the-the truck acting up again.

1:09:11.486 --> 1:09:15.222
<i>-I'm not sure
exactly, um, when...
-Dad?</i>

1:09:15.255 --> 1:09:17.492
Are you okay?

1:09:17.525 --> 1:09:20.495
Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Um...

1:09:20.528 --> 1:09:22.830
<i>Dad, where are you?</i>

1:09:22.864 --> 1:09:25.500
<i>Dr. Justin to the booking area.</i>

1:09:25.533 --> 1:09:27.301
- Ah, shit.
- Where's my call?

1:09:27.334 --> 1:09:29.336
I got busted.

1:09:29.369 --> 1:09:32.674
<i>I got no freakin' idea
when I'm getting out of here.</i>

1:09:32.707 --> 1:09:35.375
<i>I don't know
what I'm gonna do.</i>

1:09:35.410 --> 1:09:38.046
<i>-I can't believe you.
-Listen to me, Tessie...</i>

1:09:38.078 --> 1:09:41.516
<i>Hey, wish her
a happy birthday.</i>

1:09:41.549 --> 1:09:44.251
<i>Ah, shit.
That's right, it's your birthday.</i>

1:09:44.284 --> 1:09:45.687
Was that Jimmy?

1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:48.388
<i>He was with you?</i>

1:09:49.724 --> 1:09:51.191
Great.

1:09:51.224 --> 1:09:53.093
Surprise party, thank you.

1:10:12.580 --> 1:10:13.715
Tess?

1:10:13.748 --> 1:10:15.416
David.

1:10:15.450 --> 1:10:17.752
<i>I need your help.</i>

1:10:17.785 --> 1:10:19.252
What time is it?

1:10:19.286 --> 1:10:21.522
What's going on?
You all right?

1:10:21.556 --> 1:10:23.223
No, no, I'm fine,
this isn't about me.

1:10:23.256 --> 1:10:24.926
I just...

1:10:24.959 --> 1:10:26.995
I need you to promise
not to tell Mom, okay?

1:10:29.464 --> 1:10:32.199
<i>What's going on, Tess?</i>

1:10:32.232 --> 1:10:33.968
It's about my dad.

1:10:42.677 --> 1:10:44.946
Happy birthday.

1:10:44.979 --> 1:10:46.146
Mom?

1:10:49.584 --> 1:10:52.319
I shouldn't have-- I shouldn't
have surprised you like this.

1:10:52.352 --> 1:10:54.889
I'm sorry, I was--
I was going to call,

1:10:54.922 --> 1:10:56.124
but then, um...

1:10:58.092 --> 1:11:00.895
I was afraid that you
wouldn't want me to come, so...

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:04.065
I would have wanted
you to come.

1:11:06.333 --> 1:11:08.402
Where is your dad?

1:11:09.771 --> 1:11:11.673
Um...

1:11:11.706 --> 1:11:14.509
he-- he's at the gym.

1:11:20.148 --> 1:11:23.151
Tess, oh, my God.

1:11:23.183 --> 1:11:25.687
Tessie, these are beautiful.

1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.756
I'm so happy
you're drawing again.

1:11:33.226 --> 1:11:37.665
Oh, uh, David told me
to tell you that it's handled.

1:11:37.699 --> 1:11:39.534
Um, he said that you
would know what that means.

1:11:44.038 --> 1:11:46.007
Oh, um...

1:11:48.910 --> 1:11:50.545
Thanks.

1:11:50.578 --> 1:11:53.948
It's obviously not a car.

1:12:01.823 --> 1:12:03.858
These are really cute.
Thank you.

1:12:03.891 --> 1:12:05.693
I love that color on you.

1:12:08.228 --> 1:12:10.164
Your dad got me that.

1:12:10.198 --> 1:12:12.633
I thought that you
might like it.

1:12:12.667 --> 1:12:14.202
It's great, thank you.

1:12:19.239 --> 1:12:22.510
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

1:12:22.543 --> 1:12:24.746
Why did you marry Dad?

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:28.583
You guys are--
you're so different.

1:12:31.351 --> 1:12:33.921
Well, I was pregnant with you,

1:12:33.955 --> 1:12:37.225
so that might have been
part of it.

1:12:37.257 --> 1:12:39.794
I don't know, um...

1:12:39.827 --> 1:12:42.597
I think I was also trying
to get away from my parents.

1:12:46.768 --> 1:12:50.438
You know,
I remember the exact moment

1:12:50.471 --> 1:12:52.707
that I knew
that I wanted to marry him.

1:12:52.740 --> 1:12:54.675
I was at a football game,

1:12:54.709 --> 1:12:57.545
and he had just scored
the winning touchdown.

1:12:57.578 --> 1:12:59.614
And after the game,
I saw him

1:12:59.647 --> 1:13:02.917
and two of his friends
walking across the field,

1:13:02.950 --> 1:13:05.553
and so I started
down the bleachers,
and then all of a sudden,

1:13:05.586 --> 1:13:07.955
I saw all these guys,
I don't know, like ten of them

1:13:07.989 --> 1:13:09.957
from the other school,

1:13:09.991 --> 1:13:11.859
heading towards Nick
and his two buddies,

1:13:11.893 --> 1:13:15.897
and I thought, "Oh, God,
something bad's gonna happen."

1:13:15.930 --> 1:13:18.533
I started calling out
and Nick turns

1:13:18.566 --> 1:13:22.737
and one of the other guys
called out to him and he said,

1:13:22.770 --> 1:13:25.473
"You ain't so tough now,
Nicky DeNunzio."

1:13:25.506 --> 1:13:28.042
And your dad just

1:13:28.075 --> 1:13:32.547
turned and,
without blinking an eye,

1:13:32.580 --> 1:13:34.882
he said,
"You ain't got enough guys."

1:13:38.619 --> 1:13:40.154
I fell in love on the spot.

1:13:40.188 --> 1:13:41.656
I know, that was
kind of stupid.

1:13:41.689 --> 1:13:44.492
No, it's, um...
it's kind of romantic.

1:13:46.928 --> 1:13:48.328
Well, um...

1:13:48.361 --> 1:13:49.564
thank you.

1:13:49.597 --> 1:13:51.632
I-- I love the presents.

1:13:51.666 --> 1:13:54.035
Yeah. I'm so happy.

1:14:02.176 --> 1:14:03.511
Okay.

1:14:03.544 --> 1:14:05.980
Tess, um, I know

1:14:06.013 --> 1:14:08.950
that this is not the sort
of thing that people talk about,

1:14:08.983 --> 1:14:12.420
-but I need to explain
to you what happened.
-No, Mom.

1:14:12.453 --> 1:14:15.456
-You don't have to explain.
That's fine.
-Stop, listen to me.

1:14:15.489 --> 1:14:20.161
You need to know that
I did not try to kill myself.

1:14:20.194 --> 1:14:23.531
After what happened,

1:14:23.564 --> 1:14:25.066
I felt like...

1:14:26.033 --> 1:14:28.202
the life
got knocked out of me.

1:14:30.137 --> 1:14:32.440
And I couldn't sleep.

1:14:32.473 --> 1:14:36.811
And so, I, um, I started
taking sleeping pills.

1:14:36.844 --> 1:14:38.779
You know,
but no matter how many--

1:14:38.813 --> 1:14:41.048
no matter how many I took,
it just didn't work.

1:14:41.082 --> 1:14:43.451
-Mom, please, just stop, okay?
-You have to believe me.

1:14:43.484 --> 1:14:47.555
You have to believe me
because I would never,

1:14:47.588 --> 1:14:49.590
ever leave you.

1:14:51.425 --> 1:14:52.560
Never.

1:15:05.239 --> 1:15:06.540
Thank you.

1:15:49.884 --> 1:15:52.421
Can I, uh,
can I come in real quick?

1:16:04.098 --> 1:16:06.968
Look, I'm so sorry
that I lied to you.

1:16:08.069 --> 1:16:11.706
I just didn't know
when the right time
or place was to tell you.

1:16:16.844 --> 1:16:20.982
But I brought you
a birthday gift if you want it.

1:16:27.288 --> 1:16:28.990
Happy birthday, Tess.

1:16:34.463 --> 1:16:36.330
"This bag contains
all the makeup

1:16:36.364 --> 1:16:39.166
Tess DeNunzio will ever need
for the rest of her life."

1:16:43.137 --> 1:16:45.039
Yeah, very funny.

1:16:47.041 --> 1:16:49.910
That's not supposed
to be a joke.

1:18:03.384 --> 1:18:06.320
Hey, hey, hey.

1:18:06.353 --> 1:18:08.222
Tess, what's wrong?

1:18:08.255 --> 1:18:10.891
What's going on, Tess?
Talk to me.

1:18:10.925 --> 1:18:12.760
Tess.

1:18:12.793 --> 1:18:14.328
Hey.

1:18:30.878 --> 1:18:32.680
I had a baby sister.

1:18:48.095 --> 1:18:49.797
Her name was Zoe.

1:18:57.938 --> 1:19:00.040
Wait! Hey, Wait up!

1:19:00.074 --> 1:19:03.244
<i>Mom and David both knew,
but they wouldn't say.</i>

1:19:03.277 --> 1:19:05.312
<i>Even Em knew the truth.</i>

1:19:08.249 --> 1:19:10.651
<i>That I was supposed
to be watching you.</i>

1:19:10.684 --> 1:19:13.387
I'm going to go grab
a couple things and then
I'll drive you to school.

1:19:13.421 --> 1:19:16.223
Hey, Tess, tell your mom
a plane just hit
the Twin Towers.

1:19:16.257 --> 1:19:17.725
Zoe, come on,
let's go inside.

1:19:17.758 --> 1:19:20.294
-Come find me.
-Just stay there, okay?

1:19:20.327 --> 1:19:22.830
<i>What we're seeing is a gaping
hole in one of the towers</i>

1:19:22.863 --> 1:19:24.165
<i>at the World Trade Center...</i>

1:19:24.198 --> 1:19:25.634
Where's your sister?

1:19:25.666 --> 1:19:29.136
-Um, she's outside.
-Go get her.

1:19:29.170 --> 1:19:31.172
- My ball!
- Zoe!

1:19:33.107 --> 1:19:36.911
No! Mom! Mom!

1:19:43.184 --> 1:19:46.153
<i>While we waited to hear
if you were going to be okay,</i>

1:19:46.187 --> 1:19:50.024
<i>I kept playing it back
over and over in my head.</i>

1:19:50.057 --> 1:19:52.661
<i>What if I hadn't taken
so much time on my makeup?</i>

1:19:52.693 --> 1:19:54.962
<i>Then I wouldn't
have missed the bus.</i>

1:19:54.995 --> 1:19:57.364
<i>And if the weather
hadn't been so nice,</i>

1:19:57.398 --> 1:20:00.100
<i>I wouldn't have been
out front playing with you.</i>

1:20:00.134 --> 1:20:03.638
<i>Or what if Mrs. Martin
hadn't walked by
at that exact moment?</i>

1:20:03.672 --> 1:20:06.273
<i>I couldn't stop
thinking about it,</i>

1:20:06.307 --> 1:20:11.312
<i>because if someone, anyone
had just done one thing
differently that day,</i>

1:20:11.345 --> 1:20:13.847
<i>the whole world
might be different!</i>

1:20:13.881 --> 1:20:17.117
<i>Like, what if I had
just grabbed you
and taken you inside?</i>

1:20:20.221 --> 1:20:22.189
<i>You would still be here.</i>

1:20:22.223 --> 1:20:24.058
Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone.

1:20:24.091 --> 1:20:26.894
No!

1:20:26.927 --> 1:20:30.632
<i>Why didn't I
take you inside?</i>

1:20:30.665 --> 1:20:33.734
<i>I'm your big sister.</i>

1:20:33.767 --> 1:20:36.471
<i>I was supposed
to protect you.</i>

1:20:41.075 --> 1:20:43.645
It's not your fault, Tess.

1:20:43.678 --> 1:20:45.513
It's not your fault.

1:20:45.547 --> 1:20:49.684
It was a terrible,
awful accident.

1:20:49.718 --> 1:20:52.420
But that's all it was, Tess.

1:20:52.454 --> 1:20:54.422
It was just an accident.

1:20:55.423 --> 1:20:56.790
Okay?

1:21:25.986 --> 1:21:27.589
You sure you don't want
your pendant?

1:21:27.622 --> 1:21:29.356
Nah. You hang onto it.

1:21:29.390 --> 1:21:32.192
Plus, I'm coming home
for Thanksgiving, so...

1:21:35.062 --> 1:21:36.531
Are you gonna be okay?

1:21:38.232 --> 1:21:39.300
Yeah.

1:21:47.642 --> 1:21:48.876
Bye.

1:22:05.092 --> 1:22:07.462
<i>I made a deal
with David that I'd come home</i>

1:22:07.495 --> 1:22:10.097
<i>if he got my dad
and Jimmy out of jail.</i>

1:22:10.130 --> 1:22:11.666
<i>I didn't know exactly when,</i>

1:22:11.700 --> 1:22:14.602
<i>but surprisingly
someone else did.</i>

1:22:14.636 --> 1:22:17.971
You've got that same look
of disappointment as your mom.

1:22:18.005 --> 1:22:20.341
And that's fair.

1:22:20.374 --> 1:22:22.309
You're gonna figure
things out, okay?

1:22:25.045 --> 1:22:29.283
Tessie, I am so sorry.

1:22:29.316 --> 1:22:32.754
Worst day of my life
was when your mom drove away.

1:22:32.787 --> 1:22:34.689
This is the second.

1:22:38.493 --> 1:22:40.260
Come on.

1:22:53.708 --> 1:22:56.811
<i>I don't
want this to come out
the wrong way, but...</i>

1:22:56.845 --> 1:22:59.313
<i>it was easier to forget
about you at my dad's,</i>

1:22:59.346 --> 1:23:02.349
<i>especially once Jimmy and I
started hanging out together.</i>

1:23:07.522 --> 1:23:10.190
<i>Just like Mom,
I needed a little distance</i>

1:23:10.224 --> 1:23:13.360
<i>to feel something
that wasn't sadness</i>

1:23:13.394 --> 1:23:15.129
<i>or anger.</i>

1:24:27.802 --> 1:24:31.639
<i>At night,
you slept with a TV remote
instead of a teddy bear.</i>

1:24:31.673 --> 1:24:34.476
<i>You called potatoes
"motatoes."</i>

1:24:34.509 --> 1:24:38.546
<i>And you wouldn't
ever go anywhere
without your bunny ears.</i>

1:24:38.580 --> 1:24:42.650
<i>Your were precocious
and funny and loud</i>

1:24:42.684 --> 1:24:44.251
<i>and sweet,</i>

1:24:44.284 --> 1:24:47.956
<i>and I will never,
ever forget you.</i>

1:24:47.988 --> 1:24:50.959
<i>Zoe, your name...</i>

1:24:52.594 --> 1:24:53.962
<i>it means life.</i>

1:25:07.942 --> 1:25:10.143
It's okay.

1:25:16.551 --> 1:25:18.753
I'll drop your stuff
by tomorrow, all right?

1:25:21.890 --> 1:25:23.758
My, um...

1:25:23.791 --> 1:25:27.261
my yellow notebook, it's,
um, it's on my nightstand.

1:25:27.294 --> 1:25:29.196
And...

1:25:29.229 --> 1:25:32.266
there's a-- there's
a picture of Mom and Zoe

1:25:32.299 --> 1:25:33.835
and it's tucked
under my pillow.

1:25:33.868 --> 1:25:35.937
Promise me
you won't forget that, okay?

1:25:35.970 --> 1:25:37.605
I promise.

1:25:39.841 --> 1:25:41.609
What about Colin Powell?

1:25:43.678 --> 1:25:46.213
Do you mind if he
stays at your place?

1:25:46.246 --> 1:25:49.450
At least for a little while.

1:25:49.484 --> 1:25:52.453
Seems like staying at
my place for a little while
is becoming a thing.

1:26:10.237 --> 1:26:13.273
- All right.
- All right, that's enough.

1:26:18.245 --> 1:26:19.614
Tessie girl.

1:26:22.717 --> 1:26:24.251
Thank you.

1:26:41.803 --> 1:26:43.938
Tess!

1:26:47.442 --> 1:26:49.611
Hi! Come here!

1:26:49.644 --> 1:26:52.513
Baby, come here!
I missed you!

1:26:53.715 --> 1:26:56.249
Are you staying?

1:26:56.283 --> 1:26:59.286
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

1:27:03.424 --> 1:27:07.061
<i>I'm not saying
everything is okay,
'cause it's not,</i>

1:27:07.095 --> 1:27:12.265
<i>but like the whole country,
our story is far from over.</i>

1:27:12.299 --> 1:27:15.335
<i>A story about
before and after.</i>

1:27:17.472 --> 1:27:19.941
<i>Before you were born</i>

1:27:19.974 --> 1:27:22.275
<i>and after.</i>

1:27:22.309 --> 1:27:25.113
<i>Before you left us
far too soon</i>

1:27:25.145 --> 1:27:27.280
<i>and after.</i>

1:27:29.083 --> 1:27:31.085
<i>Before I ran away
to my dad's house...</i>

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:34.287
<i>...and after.</i>

1:27:34.321 --> 1:27:38.126
<i>Before I was ready
to get better</i>

1:27:38.158 --> 1:27:40.028
<i>and after.</i>

1:27:47.835 --> 1:27:49.470
<i>Love always,</i>
