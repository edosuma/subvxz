-To say hello in the laundry room.

knew Mrs. Earle?

to get in touch with him?

21:23.448 --> 21:24.866
How he might've known her.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.203
He was active in the building,
selling his nuts.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.373
Oh.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.668
But you don't know for certain
one way or another

21:34.793 --> 21:36.795
if your husband and Mrs. Earle
were acquainted?

21:36.878 --> 21:38.880
No, not for certain if Raul knew her.

21:39.506 --> 21:42.676
Well, um, thanks for being
so cooperative, Mrs. Montez.

21:43.343 --> 21:45.137
And I don't know why I get this feeling,

21:45.220 --> 21:48.557
but if you were in your apartment
when we were in the building earlier,

21:48.682 --> 21:51.852
and you were afraid to talk with us,
don't be embarrassed about that.

21:52.561 --> 21:55.022

to have to do with the police.

when she was walking in.

-and not makin' nothin' out of it.
-Well, if they came in separate,

22:45.781 --> 22:48.158

means she thinks he's involved.

-I... I... I plead guilty.
-What I'm accusing you of, Mrs. Steinman,

is what we get in a lot of this cases,
you’re holding a grudge.

out to be a little more useful.

Someone leavin' town
tends not to want to be looked for.

(PAPER BALL THUDS SOFTLY)

41:47.963 --> 41:50.883
How can them doctors
just let him leave like that?

41:52.343 --> 41:54.136
Hey, maybe you got a million friends.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.639
-Conservatively.
-Yeah, well, I don't, all right?

41:57.389 --> 42:01.018
-So, this upsets me, it stirs me up.
-Who do you talk to?

42:01.101 --> 42:03.187
How can I talk to him, Andy,
if I don't know where he is?

42:03.312 --> 42:05.314
I'm sayin' who do you talk to
when you get stirred up?

42:05.397 --> 42:06.482
I don't like bein' stirred up.

42:06.565 --> 42:08.776
What, do you get stupid
after working hours?

42:16.408 --> 42:17.493
I apologize.

42:22.039 --> 42:24.542
Want some company lookin' for your friend?

42:30.089 --> 42:33.217
What I’m hopin' is,
maybe he headed off early to Peekskill.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.970
That's where you're doin'
your reserve duty?

42:36.095 --> 42:37.179
Yeah.

42:38.013 --> 42:39.974
So, let me look around
our usual places tonight,

42:40.099 --> 42:41.684
see if he maybe changed his mind.

42:42.977 --> 42:46.272
Or otherwise, I'll hope we find him
up at reserve duty this weekend.

42:47.314 --> 42:51.235
No, he's gone. He's gone.
He's not gonna show up in Peekskill.

42:51.360 --> 42:54.738
He's gotten on a bus to crazy,
and he's probably gonna hurt himself.

42:57.575 --> 42:59.994
Sometimes, you lose people you love.

43:00.995 --> 43:01.996
Yeah.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.458
I understand that.

43:09.712 --> 43:11.547
I apologize for bein' disrespectful.

43:13.507 --> 43:14.592
Don't worry about it.

43:16.343 --> 43:19.471
-All right, Andy, I'll see you tomorrow.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

43:21.390 --> 43:26.145
(SOFT MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING)

43:36.113 --> 43:37.239
See you tomorrow.
