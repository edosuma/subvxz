00:14.597 --> 00:16.725
WHAT TO DO WHEN SHE IS MAD AT YOU

00:16.891 --> 00:19.060
Why on earth did she get mad?

00:19.185 --> 00:20.687
I have no clue.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.064
Seok, I've lived longer than you,

00:23.189 --> 00:26.359
and I know there's always a reason
when a woman gets mad.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.580
- You lazy bum!
- Oh, my!

00:38.705 --> 00:41.499
Don't be such a sloth,
and go sell the chickens!

00:41.624 --> 00:43.626
Oh, my life!

00:45.086 --> 00:46.713
What's the matter with you?

00:46.838 --> 00:48.506
She came back from the alumni reunion.

00:48.631 --> 00:50.383
Oh, I see.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.725
Oh, how can I get her to forgive me?

00:59.517 --> 01:00.852
I'm really bad at this.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.521
You're really bad at this,
but you're good at one thing.

01:03.646 --> 01:06.107
Her birthday is coming.
How about a surprise party?

01:07.650 --> 01:08.485
Yeah?

01:10.111 --> 01:12.238
He ran away! I know, he ran away!

01:12.363 --> 01:15.450
- Your mom.
- Eat them all.

01:16.868 --> 01:18.953
The veggie juice lady.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.374
- The veggie juice lady!
- The veggie juice lady!

01:33.968 --> 01:37.013
- Today is your birthday, right?
- None of your business.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.560
I have to work.
Sorry, I can't meet you.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.999
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU, AE-BONG

02:12.590 --> 02:16.511
My plan for Mom's birthday failed,
but I'll surely succeed this time.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.936
My parents are coming today.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.941
Why make such a big deal
about her birthday?

02:30.066 --> 02:32.026
She has no boyfriend
to throw a party for her.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.070
- She needs us.
- What? Her parents?

02:36.656 --> 02:37.699
What's this?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.539
What's all this?

02:45.707 --> 02:51.337
Oh, poor thing.
She must be so lonely.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.299
She planned her own birthday party.

02:55.717 --> 02:58.678
- It's good that we came.
- You're right.

02:58.803 --> 03:00.013
AE-BONG'S BIRTHDAY PARTY

03:01.890 --> 03:06.144
What's happening?
Why do I always end up like this?

03:08.146 --> 03:10.773
Doesn't she clean her room?

03:12.066 --> 03:16.362
Honey, why don't we invite
the landlords living upstairs?

03:16.487 --> 03:19.574
Right, Ae-bong said
she hadn't met them yet.

03:19.699 --> 03:22.744
We should say hello to them.
Why don't you go upstairs and invite them?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.871
Okay, I will.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.624
What? The landlords?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.834
Oh, I've got to get out of here.

03:29.959 --> 03:33.212
- Hi, my daughter lives downstairs.
- Oh, hi.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.217
We're having dinner now.
Why don't you join us?

03:37.342 --> 03:39.969
My daughter said she hadn't met you yet.

03:40.094 --> 03:42.513
Oh, you're too kind.

03:43.139 --> 03:46.351
Well, my husband is on his way home.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.478
I'll come down with him later.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.648
- Yes, that's great.
- All right.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.944
- They're coming.
- Good.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.279
There's no way out.
I'm going nuts!

03:58.404 --> 03:59.447
- Honey!
- Yeah?

03:59.572 --> 04:01.407
- Come here in the bathroom.
- Why?

04:01.532 --> 04:03.451
The sink is clogged.

04:03.576 --> 04:04.911
- Let me see.
- Here.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.040
- I'll take care of that.
- It's clogged.

04:09.165 --> 04:10.166
- Let's see.
- Now!

04:22.720 --> 04:26.808
Oh, thank you.
My husband isn't coming.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.102
So it's just me.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.937
She's here.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.522
Oh, hi.

04:32.647 --> 04:34.274
Hi.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.067
Where's her husband?

04:36.192 --> 04:38.278
Looks like she brought
her grandson instead.

04:38.736 --> 04:40.488
Come on in.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.615
- Please.
- Thanks.

04:43.950 --> 04:47.370
- Come on in.
- Yeah, hi.

04:47.495 --> 04:51.040
What do I do now?
They don't know who I am.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.256
Help yourself, please.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.343
Oh, it all looks delicious!

05:02.468 --> 05:03.845
You prepared a lot of food!

05:03.970 --> 05:07.348
- Have you met my daughter yet?
- No, not yet.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.644
While I was at my son's house,
my husband signed the contract.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.604
Right?

05:21.237 --> 05:26.743
Your husband? Not your grandson?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.953
No, it's just the two of us.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.831
What do you mean by "grandson"?

05:33.624 --> 05:35.335
She's a femme fatale.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.963
So many younger men marry
older women these days.

05:39.088 --> 05:40.214
Right.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.011
How did you know
I am older than my husband?

05:46.637 --> 05:48.890
You could be a psychic.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.975
Oh, my gosh!

06:00.693 --> 06:02.737
Oh, it's done.

06:05.656 --> 06:09.327
She hardly does the laundry.

06:09.452 --> 06:12.997
So we do the laundry for her
whenever we come here.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.291
Young ladies have no time for laundry,

06:15.416 --> 06:20.338
because they're busy playing games.

06:24.175 --> 06:26.886
She has particular tastes.

06:27.011 --> 06:30.014
So she insists on her own style.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.691
A floral print?

06:45.279 --> 06:47.782
- They're pretty.
- She collects them.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.257
Today's her birthday,
so I brought some old pictures.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.176
- Do you want to see?
- Yes, please.

07:08.761 --> 07:09.846
Here.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.683
Oh, she's so pretty!

07:13.808 --> 07:15.643
Is she your first child, or the second?

07:15.768 --> 07:17.061
She's our only child.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.356
We wanted to give her the best,
so we only had her.

07:20.481 --> 07:22.859
- Right.
- An only child?

07:26.028 --> 07:29.866
But she doesn't have "it."

07:29.991 --> 07:31.617
- What?
- It?

07:31.742 --> 07:36.205
- Oh, that.
- We gave her that.

07:36.330 --> 07:37.790
We thought she might need it.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.584
Is that possible?

07:39.709 --> 07:43.546
Sure, everything is possible.

07:54.182 --> 07:59.103
Oh, it may rain soon.
My shoulders are aching.

07:59.228 --> 08:03.941
After I turned 50, my body aches all over
when it's about to rain.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.818
So I give you a massage every day.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.030
Oh, you still love each other so much.

08:09.947 --> 08:14.243
My husband never does that.

08:14.368 --> 08:19.248
Why wouldn't he?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.261
What are you doing? I'm fine.

08:35.139 --> 08:38.142
- He really looks like her grandson.
- Shut up.

08:55.201 --> 08:56.452
I'm sorry.

08:56.953 --> 09:01.249
How did you meet your husband?

09:01.374 --> 09:05.127
Oh, you can't imagine!

09:05.253 --> 09:08.422
He was a well-known Casanova in town.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.509
All the women fell for him.

09:11.634 --> 09:17.306
He was popular
even when he went overseas.

09:17.431 --> 09:20.810
- No way!
- You're kidding!

09:20.935 --> 09:24.063
Once he laid eyes on a woman,

09:24.188 --> 09:28.150
she fell for him within three seconds.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.695
Oh, that's unbelievable.

09:33.698 --> 09:36.075
My favorite TV show is about to begin.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.994
- Oh, I see.
- Okay.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.870
- It was delicious.
- Wait a minute.

09:40.246 --> 09:43.207
This is for you.
I made it last week.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.585
Oh, thank you.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.462
You shouldn't have.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.923
Oh, well--

09:51.048 --> 09:53.050
Oh, she took me seriously.

09:53.175 --> 09:55.344
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.430
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.932
Goodbye.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.144
You need not see me off.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.521
She wants us to see her off. Get up.

10:05.646 --> 10:07.523
Oh, I see.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.358
Okay, this looks natural.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.862
I can leave like this, naturally.

10:12.987 --> 10:15.865
Naturally, naturally.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.828
Oh, thanks.
I'm home now. Talk to you later.

10:20.953 --> 10:21.996
Oh, she's here.
What do we do?

10:22.121 --> 10:23.414
Hide!

10:23.664 --> 10:24.540
Hide with us!

10:24.665 --> 10:25.958
- Hurry!
- Yeah!

10:35.134 --> 10:37.595
- Happy birthday to you, Ae-bong!
- Happy birthday!

10:39.055 --> 10:45.019
- What are you--
- Happy birthday, Ae-bong!

10:47.229 --> 10:50.232
Ae-bong, he lives upstairs.

10:50.358 --> 10:52.818
Thank you! I love you!

10:54.779 --> 11:00.451
"Once he laid eyes on a woman,
she fell for him within three seconds."

11:02.912 --> 11:05.873
Get off my daughter, you dirty dog!

11:06.624 --> 11:10.628
Be careful!
He has a wife and children!

11:10.753 --> 11:12.713
- Oh, no.
- Mom!

11:12.838 --> 11:13.798
- Mom.
- Oh, my.

11:15.341 --> 11:18.260
What are you doing?

11:18.386 --> 11:21.263
Come here! What did you do?

11:22.264 --> 11:23.474
What did you do?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.646
What is your secret?

11:31.065 --> 11:35.403
ASK YOUR DAUGHTER

11:51.377 --> 11:55.047
Seok said he planned an event
for Ae-bong.

11:56.048 --> 11:58.300
I should do the same.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.063
Who-- who are you?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.356
Who are you?

12:12.481 --> 12:15.067
I'm her boyfriend.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.402
I'm her lover.

12:16.527 --> 12:19.196
- Oh. What?
- Well--

12:19.321 --> 12:21.073
- I'm--
- I'm--

12:31.459 --> 12:33.669
- Who are you?
- I'm her husband.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.172
What?

12:37.298 --> 12:40.301
- I'm--
- I'm--

12:40.426 --> 12:42.178
Wait.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.392
Hey--

12:52.229 --> 12:53.898
Who are you?

12:54.023 --> 12:55.399
Boyfriend!

12:57.234 --> 12:59.028
- Hey.
- No, you can't!

13:00.279 --> 13:02.698
How do you say this in English?
Many, many.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.493
- Full, full!
- Many.

13:12.166 --> 13:17.296
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Oh, my God!

13:21.467 --> 13:22.551
Wow!

13:27.765 --> 13:31.393
SHANGHAI, CHINA

13:38.901 --> 13:41.695
I'm homesick after a month in China
on a business trip.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.489
I miss Korea.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.574
I miss Korean people.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.580
Oh, right.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.041
Why hadn't I thought of that?

13:54.667 --> 13:59.296
Oh, good! Take the call.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.764
What is it? What do I touch?

14:08.889 --> 14:11.600
- Oh!
- Mom!

14:11.725 --> 14:13.769
Mom, Mom, it's me, Jun!

14:13.894 --> 14:17.189
Jun, what is this?

14:17.314 --> 14:18.607
Can we see each other like this?

14:18.732 --> 14:19.817
Wow, this is amazing!

14:19.942 --> 14:22.736
Mom, the Internet is so advanced now.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.742
INTERNET MAN

14:28.868 --> 14:30.077
Where is everybody?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.955
Where's Dad? Where's Seok?

14:33.080 --> 14:34.373
They're busy.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.875
No, I'm not busy. Why?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.294
I'm sorry.
Please, go to my school in my place.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.463
- I'm in a hurry now.
- Your school?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.509
Do you want me to answer
the roll call for you?

14:45.926 --> 14:49.471
- I have Girlfriend's concert tickets.
- Okay!

14:49.889 --> 14:52.224
- I'm going out.
- Say hello to your brother.

14:52.349 --> 14:55.185
- I'm late. I'll talk to him later.
- Hey, Seok! It's me!

14:55.311 --> 14:57.605
It's your brother from China!
Where are you going?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.608
He always pretends he's busy.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.443
Mom, did you eat? What did you eat?

15:02.568 --> 15:04.111
I'm asking you if you ate.

15:04.236 --> 15:07.740
- What did you do today?
- One thing at a time.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.575
I ate lunch and was watching a TV show.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.536
A TV show? I want to watch that.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.455
I'm so bored. TV. TV.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.207
I want to watch Korean TV shows!

15:17.333 --> 15:18.792
Okay!

15:21.170 --> 15:24.048
Right, I love Korean TV shows.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.674
Great.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.719
I want to marry her.
Please allow us to get married.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.220
- No.
- Why not?

15:30.346 --> 15:33.223
Why? She's your half-sister!

15:33.349 --> 15:35.309
In fact, she's your half-sister.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.687
Right! I told you so!

15:38.812 --> 15:42.024
And she comes back a few years later
with a mole on her cheek.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.359
But no one recognizes her.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.320
Nice to meet you.
You're so beautiful.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.197
Nice to meet you.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.493
That's it! Isn't this cool?
No one recognizes her!

15:53.327 --> 15:55.496
Oh, a coffee shop? I know.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.873
Insert some product placement here.

15:57.998 --> 16:02.002
Hey, make sure you don't block the logo!

16:02.127 --> 16:03.712
Here's your coffee.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.467
Good! The logo is showing!

16:08.592 --> 16:12.096
And then the mother gives
the woman an envelope.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
"This should be enough."

16:13.847 --> 16:15.224
This should be enough.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.061
Right! But the woman

16:19.186 --> 16:21.230
flatly refuses now!

16:21.897 --> 16:23.565
I can't take this.

16:23.691 --> 16:27.194
Then the mother throws water
on her.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.738
"How dare you lay eyes on my son?"

16:29.863 --> 16:32.032
How dare you lay eyes on my son?

16:33.575 --> 16:35.536
Ta-da! Mom, am I right?

16:35.661 --> 16:36.912
Mom, I must become a psychic.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.373
Mom, could I be a psychic?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.501
Where are you going, Mom?

16:42.626 --> 16:43.919
Mom, you have to watch this!

16:44.044 --> 16:46.338
She's going to slap her with kimchi!

16:46.463 --> 16:47.965
You must see it!

16:48.090 --> 16:50.676
You keep watching.
I'm going to the supermarket.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.553
Where? The supermarket?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.263
Mom, I want to go to the supermarket.

16:54.388 --> 16:56.056
Mom, take me, take me with you.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.891
Take this with you!

16:58.017 --> 17:00.269
Mom, I'm bored!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.771
I'm bored! Mom, I'm so bored!

17:08.110 --> 17:10.112
No, not that one.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.365
Mom, that ramen is healthier.

17:13.490 --> 17:18.537
There's no MSG added,
but I love MSG!

17:21.498 --> 17:23.667
No, not that one.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.377
That one is the No.1 ramen

17:25.502 --> 17:27.463
when you add rice in the soup,

17:27.588 --> 17:30.174
but I don't like adding rice in ramen.

17:30.299 --> 17:33.886
Mom, put that down.
Right, get that one, that one.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.722
Right, in the back, that one.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.893
Mom, how come you don't know
my taste?

17:41.018 --> 17:41.894
The spicy one!

17:43.645 --> 17:44.813
Yes, that one.

17:53.822 --> 17:55.324
Hello, baby.

17:55.449 --> 17:58.202
Hi, hi.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.496
Merry Christmas!

18:03.332 --> 18:06.376
Get the ramen next to you.
It tastes great with rice.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.964
Here it is. Lecture room 103.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.677
- Mr. Seok Cho?
- Yeah.

18:15.803 --> 18:17.429
I heard you were coming.

18:17.554 --> 18:20.015
Why did he tell her
I'm going to answer to the roll call?

18:20.140 --> 18:21.433
Yes.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.442
- Please, sit here.
- Thank you.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.950
It's been a while since I've done this.
Feels like I'm back in college.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.209
What am I going to do to kill time?

18:52.673 --> 18:54.049
WEBTOON ARTIST SEOK CHO'S
SPECIAL LECTURE

18:54.174 --> 18:56.593
He's a professor?

19:20.534 --> 19:25.080
I don't want to give you
a typical lecture today.

19:25.205 --> 19:28.500
I want you to express your own creativity.

19:28.625 --> 19:32.171
Shall we draw a 4-panel cartoon?

19:32.296 --> 19:33.255
Okay.

19:42.389 --> 19:45.350
If you open your mouth once more,
I'll turn this off.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.426
Where are your manners?

20:19.551 --> 20:23.472
No, I didn't do it. It's my son.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.271
Mom, what are you doing on the bus?
Did you fart, or poop?

20:32.231 --> 20:36.443
- You're lying!
- Actually, my mom is a good lady.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.503
They could've noticed.
Let's just play with my laptop.

20:54.628 --> 20:56.421
It's so nice to be a professor!

20:56.546 --> 20:59.591
Turn off the speaker,
tilt the screen...

20:59.716 --> 21:02.928
and mumble some terminologies.
That'll make it perfect.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.556
Illustration, pixel.

21:13.772 --> 21:18.735
When you have a hard time
drawing something, look at real images.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.677
ACTORS IN LOVE?
BOTH DENY THE RUMORS

21:48.181 --> 21:49.975
Yeah! I'm the first!

21:52.853 --> 21:54.146
I personally believe that

21:54.271 --> 21:58.859
a three-dimensional effect
is most important for cartoons.

22:16.043 --> 22:17.377
Focus on your cartoons.

22:17.502 --> 22:20.339
It may look like I'm doing nothing,
but I'm watching you.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.260
Quiet, quiet!

22:27.137 --> 22:29.681
If you make noise like this
during the class,

22:29.806 --> 22:31.892
I can't give you what I've got.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.269
All my knowledge, all my skills...

22:34.394 --> 22:35.479
I want to give you everything.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.897
I'm the giving tree.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.523
Focus, all of you!

22:44.780 --> 22:48.325
When you get back home,
I'll kill you.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.243
- Where are you going?
- To see friends.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.788
It's Jun. Take it.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.166
- What's this?
- Dad, where are you going?

22:56.291 --> 22:58.585
Jun, are you doing okay?

22:58.710 --> 23:02.714
- Are you still ugly?
- Yes, Father. Thank you for the blessing.

23:02.839 --> 23:03.882
Where are you going?

23:04.007 --> 23:05.842
- To have a drink.
- A drink?

23:05.967 --> 23:09.638
Dad, take me. I want to have a drink.

23:09.763 --> 23:11.098
- With you.
- Okay.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.558
- Let's go.
- Thank you!

23:15.852 --> 23:19.189
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

23:26.363 --> 23:29.199
Jun, have a drink.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.784
Here, here.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.829
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.623
Your love is overflowing!

23:41.002 --> 23:42.879
Give him a big hand!

23:43.004 --> 23:46.716
Drink up, drink up!

23:46.842 --> 23:50.137
- Ah-hh!
- Yummy!

23:50.262 --> 23:51.930
Here, have some peanuts.

23:52.055 --> 23:55.016
- Yummy!
- He's a great son.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.226
Yeah, thanks.

23:59.855 --> 24:04.025
Are you happy there?

24:04.609 --> 24:06.153
Hello.

24:09.906 --> 24:13.285
The next song is--

24:15.745 --> 24:17.831
Dad, wait a second.
Someone's at the door.

24:17.956 --> 24:22.085
Who is it? Your girlfriend?
Hey, where are you?

24:29.509 --> 24:31.303
One, two, three, four!

24:31.928 --> 24:37.559
I am your--

24:44.399 --> 24:47.777
When I feel lonely,

24:47.903 --> 24:50.113
who'll be my friend?

24:50.238 --> 24:52.616
It's you, Dad.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.368
Dad, Dad.

24:57.829 --> 25:01.583
I'm your

25:03.084 --> 25:06.922
Eternal song!

25:09.132 --> 25:12.969
Dad, thanks to you,
it was so much fun today.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.347
I had fun, too.

25:15.472 --> 25:16.932
I'll have some food now.

25:30.320 --> 25:31.529
Why is the screen so dark?

25:31.655 --> 25:34.491
Dad, where are you?

26:04.479 --> 26:06.648
I'll show you my favorite thing.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.942
Which one? Show me.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.492
Take a look.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.080
This one. Isn't this pretty?

26:22.205 --> 26:25.333
It was so hard to get this one.
This is from a used clothes shop.

26:25.458 --> 26:28.503
This needs some wear and tear.
That's why it looks nice, you know.

26:28.628 --> 26:29.879
How would I know that?

26:30.005 --> 26:31.339
Lately I wear this every day.

26:31.464 --> 26:35.677
I feel so confident when I wear it.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.345
That's why people
wear something like this.

26:40.682 --> 26:43.685
Dad, I need to go.
I'm hanging up now.

26:44.602 --> 26:45.729
Oh, he hung up.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.024
He doesn't know how nice it is.

- Yeah.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.373
You called, you asshole!

27:08.043 --> 27:11.212
Oh, Seok is logged on now.
Didn't he say he was busy?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.465
Pick it up, Seok!

27:15.133 --> 27:17.594
- Seok!
- Who's this?

27:18.345 --> 27:21.222
Why did he leave his laptop
unattended?

27:21.348 --> 27:23.183
What if it gets stolen?

27:23.308 --> 27:24.267
Hey!

27:26.811 --> 27:28.980
- Who are you?
- We want to turn it off.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.565
Turn it off? Why would you do that?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.901
Buzz off!

27:33.026 --> 27:35.737
Let's just turn it off.

27:35.862 --> 27:37.781
Get out of my face!

27:37.906 --> 27:40.575
Or I'll give you a present.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.911
- Oh.
- Oh, shit!

27:43.036 --> 27:45.705
Mom, see my butt!

27:45.830 --> 27:47.749
I see my butt!

27:47.874 --> 27:50.085
My butt!

27:52.837 --> 27:54.923
Surprise, you morons!

27:55.048 --> 27:57.634
Buzz off! Go away!

27:57.759 --> 27:59.344
Oh, yeah? Okay.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.888
What is he doing?

28:04.599 --> 28:05.767
Hey, I'm taking my pants off!

28:05.892 --> 28:07.602
Let's run! Go!

28:07.727 --> 28:09.396
On the count of three!

28:09.521 --> 28:11.689
One!

28:13.108 --> 28:14.943
I know what you really want!

28:15.068 --> 28:16.111
See my undies!

28:16.236 --> 28:17.112
Know who I am?

28:17.695 --> 28:19.572
I'm the big brother of Seok Cho

28:19.697 --> 28:21.449
who owns this laptop!

28:21.574 --> 28:24.536
It's not everyday you can see me
like this.

28:24.661 --> 28:27.288
You want to see my butt? Wait!

28:27.914 --> 28:30.750
Think I won't take my pants off?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.128
How ridiculous!

28:33.253 --> 28:35.171
Hey, take a good look.

28:35.588 --> 28:38.425
There you go.

See? This is a king-sized dumpling.

And she's already married.

29:17.046 --> 29:19.549
Oh. That's why.

29:21.968 --> 29:22.969

- Shut up!

29:26.139 --> 29:28.767
- How delicious!
- Yeah.
