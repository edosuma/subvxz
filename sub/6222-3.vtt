40:32.639 --> 40:33.849
Come on!

40:35.017 --> 40:37.352
Please, come on, you stubborn old goat!

40:44.192 --> 40:47.154
Who are you calling an old goat?

41:05.297 --> 41:07.633
You mean to tell me
it was you who was responsible

41:07.716 --> 41:12.929
for the baldness, the flatulence,
the boils and Arthur's donkey ears?

41:16.058 --> 41:17.726
| fear I was, my lord.

41:17.809 --> 41:21.355
Or at least the goblin was,
while I was possessed by it.

41:22.356 --> 41:25.984
Magic has the power to corrupt
even the most honorable of men.

41:26.860 --> 41:31.990
Indeed. Though I must assure you
that Merlin was entirely innocent.

41:35.702 --> 41:36.745
Then he is pardoned.

41:38.246 --> 41:41.083
(GROWLING)

41:41.583 --> 41:46.088
May I suggest it is kept
where no one will ever open it.

41:47.089 --> 41:49.257
See that it's placed in the vaults.

41:52.427 --> 41:53.595
Gaius.

41:55.430 --> 42:00.018
Do you know who was responsible for
releasing the goblin in the first place?

42:01.937 --> 42:04.022
I'm afraid I've no idea, my lord.

42:11.154 --> 42:12.489
(GROWLING)

42:14.324 --> 42:15.409
Now.

42:15.867 --> 42:17.452
Secure it now.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.714
-My lord.
-Guinevere.

42:35.303 --> 42:40.142
The events of the last few days, I...

42:41.393 --> 42:43.645
| think it would be best if we

42:44.771 --> 42:45.897
never spoke of them.

42:47.441 --> 42:49.693
| don't even know what events
you're referring to.

42:51.653 --> 42:52.821
Quite.

42:53.280 --> 42:57.492
It's been entirely uneventful.

43:08.086 --> 43:09.171
| need to train my men.

43:09.254 --> 43:11.089
| must see to these sheets.

43:11.673 --> 43:12.841
(SIGHS)

43:23.018 --> 43:25.687
| see you've been busy
undoing the goblin's magic.

43:26.229 --> 43:28.648
As usual, I'll get no thanks
for it whatsoever.

43:28.732 --> 43:32.152
Since releasing the goblin
was entirely your fault, Merlin,

43:32.235 --> 43:34.196
| am not sure you deserve any thanks.

43:36.448 --> 43:37.657
Arthur doesn't know that.

43:38.033 --> 43:40.577
For your sake,
you better hope it stays that way.

43:50.670 --> 43:51.880
(BRAYS)

43:56.384 --> 43:57.552
Merlin.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.430
Just one more day.

44:00.514 --> 44:02.057
(CLEARS THROAT)

44:02.432 --> 44:04.100
It's too good.

44:10.273 --> 44:11.608
Merlin.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.737
The melee is the ultimate test
of strength and courage.

44:16.905 --> 44:18.198
Are you sure we're talking
about the same thing?

44:20.367 --> 44:21.493
I'm Gwaine.

44:22.702 --> 44:24.037
The man saved my life, Gaius.

44:24.788 --> 44:26.122
That serving boy is on to us.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.417
Merlin should be back by now.

44:31.837 --> 44:33.463
| think they mean
to Kill Arthur in the melee.
