WEBVTT

00:10.400 --> 00:13.280
Too upset... to cry.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.080
That might be the most
I've ever told them off.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.280
That might be the most
she's ever told us off.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.360
I've just never seen Alison
so angry.

00:52.360 --> 00:55.320
She used a word
I'd never heard before

00:55.320 --> 00:57.120
as a verb and a noun.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.320
Yes, was
rather colourful. I mean,

00:59.320 --> 01:01.640
I did some pretty awful things
back in the day,

01:01.640 --> 01:05.080
but I have never been rebuked
like th...

01:05.080 --> 01:07.680
Oh, hang on, actually.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.560
There was this one time...

01:09.560 --> 01:11.800
Oh, and they just go on
and on and on and on.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.640
And they know
that we're stressed,

01:13.640 --> 01:15.120
with the Gatehouse
and this place.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.560
I know. They're a lot.

01:17.560 --> 01:20.280
I mean, I find them a lot,
and I can't see or hear them.

01:22.680 --> 01:24.160
Turns out,

01:24.160 --> 01:27.840
the arms contract had been sold
to the newspapers

01:27.840 --> 01:30.040
by one of the prostitutes.

01:30.040 --> 01:33.360
Too confused to cry.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.880
So, how do we make things
right?

01:35.880 --> 01:38.400
Well, you'd have to refund
the Libyans,

01:38.400 --> 01:39.800
find the prostitute...

01:39.800 --> 01:41.160
With Alison!
Oh.

01:41.160 --> 01:44.160
Well, is obvious.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.760
We need say sorry.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.560
Huh?

01:48.560 --> 01:50.960
No. No, no, no, no, no.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.320
No, that... Ye...

01:52.320 --> 01:55.280
Yeah, no, just... Just thanks
for letting us know.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.040
Yeah. All the best, yeah.
Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.000
Bye.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.960
Unbelievable!

02:01.960 --> 02:03.680
I mean, how selfish can you be?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.520
What happened?
The Carters just cancelled.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.840
What? Why?

02:06.840 --> 02:08.680
Because they're evil.

02:08.680 --> 02:10.600
Er, and maybe
because their cat's ill.

02:10.600 --> 02:12.120
But mainly cos they're evil.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.840
I mean, what is the point

02:13.840 --> 02:15.840
in us offering
five-star service

02:15.840 --> 02:18.200
if there's no-one here
to give it five stars?

02:18.200 --> 02:20.760
Hey, you know what this means?
That we're going to go bankrupt?

02:20.760 --> 02:21.800
It means that

02:21.800 --> 02:24.000
a very nice little guesthouse
that I know of

02:24.000 --> 02:26.280
happens to have
a last-minute vacancy.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.600
Yeah, I just told you that.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.000
No, I mean... for us.
Well, for you.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.120
You never lose it
like you did this morning,

02:34.120 --> 02:35.200
even with that lot.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.880
You're frazzled.
You need to unwind.

02:37.880 --> 02:41.080
Listen, if I said
you had a day off

02:41.080 --> 02:43.480
and you could do anything
you wanted, what would it be?

02:43.480 --> 02:45.720
I don't know.

02:45.720 --> 02:48.360
Like... maybe a spa day?

02:48.360 --> 02:49.560
Mm.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.280
Or maybe like a nice meal.

02:51.280 --> 02:53.160
Or a picnic!

02:54.280 --> 02:56.080
Or the cinema.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.400
Well, that's what we'll do.

02:57.400 --> 02:58.840
Which?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.520
All of it.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.880
We have to be very careful.

03:01.880 --> 03:05.000
I'm just saying, if we want
Alison to hear us out,

03:05.000 --> 03:07.680
we should send the person
she likes the most.

03:07.680 --> 03:10.280
Very well. I shall try,
but I can't guarantee...

03:12.040 --> 03:14.400
I was thinking more Kitty.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.560
Is that wise under
the circumstances? After all,

03:17.560 --> 03:19.240
it was Kitty who pushed her
over the edge.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.960
That's a lie!

03:20.960 --> 03:22.520
You said you wished
she was dead.

03:22.520 --> 03:23.880
No, I didn't.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.360
Quite the opposite. I said
that I wanted to comfort her

03:26.360 --> 03:28.320
and hope that one day,
God willing,

03:28.320 --> 03:30.560
I'll be able to hug her
and hold her and...

03:30.560 --> 03:31.920
Yes, I see what you mean.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.920
But it was you who made her
use the C-word.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.360
It was you
who was being callous. Oh!

03:38.360 --> 03:40.320
Come on,
it was one little finger.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.840
It was inappropriate.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.240
I just so missed the texture.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.520
Mm. I was being the soldier.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.280
You are not to use that term!
Oh, here he goes,

03:49.280 --> 03:51.440
barking his orders.
No wonder she's sick of you.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.920
Do not lay this
at my door, sir!

03:53.920 --> 03:56.680
I was merely telling Robin
not to play with the lamps...

03:56.680 --> 03:58.480
Hey, no you pin this on me!
Was Fanny,

03:58.480 --> 04:00.240
with the yibbayabba, yibbayabba.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.240
Excuse me, Robin!
It was nothing to do...

04:11.080 --> 04:12.160
Oh!

04:12.160 --> 04:14.600
Five stars, right?
Yeah.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.200
And it's all ours.

04:18.120 --> 04:19.840
Ooooh, yeah. Oh,

04:19.840 --> 04:22.640
you've go to have a go
on some of... What?

04:22.640 --> 04:26.120
Sorry. I'm just thinking about how
long it takes to change the bedding.

04:26.120 --> 04:28.600
No, no, no. No. We're not thinking
about bedding,

04:28.600 --> 04:30.480
or cleaning,

04:30.480 --> 04:32.320
or hoovering or dusting
or bin change...

04:33.640 --> 04:35.600
Yeah, you're right.
It was a terrible idea.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.240
It's never going to happen, is it?

04:37.240 --> 04:39.440
So, day off's off?
No, day off's on.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.600
Just... not here.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.240
Er... I've got a better idea.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.600
You want a piece of me?!

04:46.600 --> 04:48.400
Right. Right. Right!

04:50.240 --> 04:51.440
Bang!

04:51.440 --> 04:53.320
Oh! What are you doing?

04:53.320 --> 04:55.400
I was firing my pistol
into the air.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.360
You don't have a pistol.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.800
Well, we didn't win the war with
attitudes like that, did we?

04:59.800 --> 05:02.280
This blame game
is getting us nowhere.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.080
It's quite clear that we all
share some responsibility

05:05.080 --> 05:07.840
for provoking
Alison's outburst,

05:07.840 --> 05:10.960
whether it's Julian fingering,
Fanny's lip

05:10.960 --> 05:12.720
or Mary and her...

05:12.720 --> 05:17.440
Why, Mary, I do believe that
you didn't do anything wrong.

05:17.440 --> 05:21.120
Oh, no. Er... No.
I suppose... I suppose not.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.840
Hey, this is perfect!

05:23.840 --> 05:25.920
Alison can't be cross
with Mary

05:25.920 --> 05:27.640
if she's done nothing wrong.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.880
Let's send Mary in
with our apologies,

05:30.880 --> 05:33.320
wait for the dust to settle,
and then...

05:33.320 --> 05:34.400
Yeah, no, actually.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.320
No. I'm thinking... no.
To that. To doing that.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.680
But you're our secret weapon, Mary.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.800
Yeah. No. Right. It's just...

05:42.800 --> 05:45.920
Erm, I tooks the fall
for something I didn't do

05:45.920 --> 05:47.880
once before,
and it didn't turn out

05:47.880 --> 05:50.360
all that well for me.

05:50.360 --> 05:53.200
So I'm... I'm thinkin', erm,
maybe this time

05:53.200 --> 05:55.960
I'm going to leave the guilt
for the guilty.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.560
Cos someone in this room
has done nothing wrong!

06:02.440 --> 06:05.720
Ah. Looks like
it has to be one of us.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.600
Any volunteers?

06:09.120 --> 06:12.360
Or we could do nominations?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.760
Ah, well in that case...

06:19.360 --> 06:21.080
Oooh.
Mm!

06:21.080 --> 06:24.560
I like it. Homely.
Really homely.

06:24.560 --> 06:27.080
Oh, I think these
might be the owners.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.560
Oh-ho, she did all right!

06:29.560 --> 06:30.840
What are you doing?

06:30.840 --> 06:33.320
You can't go lying down,
you've got relaxing to do.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.120
Do you hear yourself?

06:35.120 --> 06:36.960
We have a list. Your list.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.360
And we've just lost 45 minutes
going nowhere.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.040
Well, if it's my list,
I'm adding lying down.

06:43.120 --> 06:46.360
OK, OK. But it's already 10.30,
so we can't just go adding...

06:47.920 --> 06:50.960
You know what?
It's fine. Er...

06:50.960 --> 06:53.840
If we combine it with
"listening to some music,"

06:53.840 --> 06:56.280
then I think
I can make it work.

06:56.280 --> 06:57.640
Deal.

06:57.640 --> 06:59.200
OK, so I just add that on,

06:59.200 --> 07:01.440
cross it off,

07:01.440 --> 07:04.440
and we're back on track. Almost.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.360
Right. See you in 30.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.680
Where are you going?
Shop. We need ingredients.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.000
Ingredients for what?

07:10.000 --> 07:12.080
Whatever you want.
It's your day.

07:12.080 --> 07:14.680
Oh. OK, so could we get...?

07:14.680 --> 07:15.880
No time. Text me.

07:19.200 --> 07:20.400
No, no...

07:22.440 --> 07:23.480
Er...

07:23.480 --> 07:25.560
You've got the most
to apologise for.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.440
Tadadadadadada!
Tadadadadadada!

07:29.440 --> 07:31.640
Chacachac,
clink, clink, clink...

07:31.640 --> 07:33.160
Now...

07:33.160 --> 07:36.440
Yeah. I did not for a moment
want to bring out

07:36.440 --> 07:38.120
the Bren Mark 1
light machinegun

07:38.120 --> 07:40.520
in such an enclosed space,
but you forced my hand.

07:40.520 --> 07:43.560
Is he having a breakdown?
Very hard to tell.

07:43.560 --> 07:45.840
This bickering is futile.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.880
If nobody wants
to take on this mission,

07:47.880 --> 07:50.720
then, as ranking officer,
I shall step up to the plate

07:50.720 --> 07:53.440
and issue an apology
on behalf of the entire unit.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.600
My command experience
has taught me

07:55.600 --> 07:57.800
a thing or two
about effective communication

07:57.800 --> 08:00.800
you have to be direct,
concise and to the point.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.360
Apologies.

08:05.360 --> 08:07.120
Not accepted. Understood.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.880
She can't be reasoned with.
Nothing to be done.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.600
We shall just have to avoid her
until she dies.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.080
Probably longer.

08:16.080 --> 08:19.360
Yes, well, whilst I'm sure
you mined every ounce

08:19.360 --> 08:21.120
of your natural warmth,
do you think

08:21.120 --> 08:23.240
you could take us through
your key messaging?

08:24.280 --> 08:26.800
What?
Yeah, thought so.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.240
You see,
you can't just go around

08:28.240 --> 08:29.920
shouting orders at people
any more.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.000
He's got a point. Silence.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.240
Communication's become
much more nuanced

08:34.240 --> 08:38.040
in this modern age
of car phones and pagers.

08:38.040 --> 08:41.000
But, luckily,

08:41.000 --> 08:42.880
you're looking
at one of history's

08:42.880 --> 08:44.360
greatest communicators,

08:44.360 --> 08:45.600
the brains behind some of

08:45.600 --> 08:48.000
the most memorable
political slogans

08:48.000 --> 08:50.160
of the 20th century. Erm...

08:50.160 --> 08:54.360
"Family, family, family."
Yours truly.

08:54.360 --> 08:57.600
As was..."Better for Britain."

08:57.600 --> 08:59.240
"I'm in. Are you?"

08:59.240 --> 09:03.560
And of course...
"A dog's just for Christmas."

09:03.560 --> 09:06.440
I think it was..."A dog's
not just for Christmas."

09:06.440 --> 09:09.040
No. One year,
there was a surplus.

09:09.040 --> 09:11.640
Must have been the heat.
Oh, surely not him.

09:11.640 --> 09:14.720
Yep, that was another one.
Election '83.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.560
OK, then.

09:38.560 --> 09:43.360
I now declare this meeting
of Being In The Right Club

09:43.360 --> 09:45.000
officially open.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.400
What's that?

09:47.400 --> 09:50.000
Oh, no, it's just, erm,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.320
just us today, Flo.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.400
Just us.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.360
No. Yeah.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.440
Yes?

10:21.440 --> 10:23.360
We're closer...

10:23.360 --> 10:25.480
...together.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.600
What?

10:27.600 --> 10:29.800
We're closer... Yeah?

10:29.800 --> 10:33.200
...together. Mm-hm.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.800
Than what?
Oh, come on!

10:34.800 --> 10:37.640
This is very clear messaging.
How are you not getting this?

10:37.640 --> 10:43.480
We - you and us - are closer
you know, rubbing along,

10:43.480 --> 10:45.480
despite your over-sensitivity,

10:45.480 --> 10:47.480
together -

10:47.480 --> 10:49.720
ie, not off moping
in our rooms about,

10:49.720 --> 10:51.920
I don't know,
whatever petty grievance it is

10:51.920 --> 10:54.000
that's got you in such a tizz.

10:54.000 --> 10:58.160
So let's admit mistakes
were made on both sides

10:58.160 --> 10:59.480
and hope that tomorrow

10:59.480 --> 11:01.360
you get out of the bed
the right side.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.240
Because the fact is...

11:04.240 --> 11:06.240
...we are closer...

11:06.240 --> 11:08.560
...together.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.120
Go away.

11:13.960 --> 11:15.640
Now, that's clear messaging.

11:22.040 --> 11:23.440
Did you forget your keys?

11:23.440 --> 11:26.120
No, no, I'm still at the shop.
Ingredients crisis.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.560
There's chicken, but no breadcrumbs,
so Milanese is off.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.680
Er, I can do salmon
if you can live without lemon.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.760
Do they have broccoli?
Normal, not purple,

11:32.760 --> 11:34.600
but I could switch
for asparagus if...

11:34.600 --> 11:36.280
Without lemon?
I wasn't thinking. OK.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.720
Yeah. Let's bring back the chicken.
We'll go peri peri.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.200
Do they have paprika?
Er, normal, not smoky.

11:41.200 --> 11:42.920
OK, OK. Let's make it satay.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.880
Which aisle is peanuts?

11:44.880 --> 11:47.360
Just get peanut butter.
Smooth or crunchy? Just get both.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.400
But that's back with jams. I haven't
got time. Just leave it. Get out.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.680
I'm coming out.
Go! Go!

11:51.680 --> 11:53.000
Any joy?

11:53.000 --> 11:54.760
Well, you know, er,

11:54.760 --> 11:57.160
how does one define success?

11:58.280 --> 11:59.440
Messed it up.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.520
I suppose
Elton John was right.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.640
Sorry does seem to be
the hardest word.

12:05.640 --> 12:08.720
No. Hardest word is
"apolocathry."

12:09.800 --> 12:11.280
Ap...

12:11.280 --> 12:15.160
Hang on.
Maybe Elton John had a point.

12:15.160 --> 12:19.840
If it's too hard to say it,
could we sing it?

12:22.640 --> 12:25.240
Hey. Still relaxing?
All relaxed?

12:25.240 --> 12:26.560
Where have you been?

12:26.560 --> 12:29.320
Yeah. Well, turns out
that if you run out

12:29.320 --> 12:31.480
of a supermarket still holding
a pack of stock cubes,

12:31.480 --> 12:33.360
security want to have
a little word with you.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.160
Oh, God.
Yeah, no, it's fine.

12:35.160 --> 12:38.080
I, er.. I made this great joke
about pinching their stock,

12:38.080 --> 12:39.920
and we're basically mates now.
He loved it.

12:39.920 --> 12:42.120
Yeah?
Yeah. Whoa, OK.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.320
Er, there's no time to cook
and we have nothing to cook,

12:45.320 --> 12:48.000
so I thought
we can order something in.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.840
Like... pizza?
What's faster than pizza?

12:49.840 --> 12:51.280
Pizza's fine.
Yeah?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.560
Yeah.
OK, great.

12:52.560 --> 12:53.760
Well, you order the pizza,

12:53.760 --> 12:57.040
and I will dig out the picnic set.
Pizza picnic?

12:57.040 --> 12:58.080
Yeah.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.560
Well, you wanted a picnic,
so you're having a picnic.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.640
Aw.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.120
I think it may be... carpet picnic.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.080
Good call.
All right.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.360
You just keep relaxing.

13:10.360 --> 13:11.880
OK. Er... OK.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.560
But order a pizza!
Oh, all righty!

13:17.560 --> 13:19.960
But lyrics
are a form of poetry,

13:19.960 --> 13:22.960
and mastery of
the English language is my...

13:24.640 --> 13:25.840
...thing.
Yeah, I know.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.120
It's just that you can be
a little maudlin, mate,

13:28.120 --> 13:30.280
and I think it should be
something upbeat,

13:30.280 --> 13:32.160
like, have you heard
of Ging Gang Goolie?

13:32.160 --> 13:33.240
The disease?

13:33.240 --> 13:34.640
What?

13:34.640 --> 13:37.160
No. As in like, you know,
"Ging Gang Goolie gotcha."

13:37.160 --> 13:38.560
It most certainly did not!

13:38.560 --> 13:41.360
Although I hear
Byron had a terrible case.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.960
Wha...?
Look, clearly neither of you

13:43.960 --> 13:45.640
are exactly Cole Porter.
Who?

13:45.640 --> 13:48.440
My Heart Belongs To Daddy?

13:50.320 --> 13:52.560
Philistines. My point is,
perhaps you should look

13:52.560 --> 13:55.160
to a more skilled songsmith
for your inspiration.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.400
I mean,
how does John Elton compose?

13:57.400 --> 14:00.160
Oh, for the last time,
it's not Elton, comma, John.

14:00.160 --> 14:02.960
It's Elton John!
And he has a co-writer.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.400
Bernie does the words,
and Elt does the music.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.760
Ah!
Music's being taken care of,

14:07.760 --> 14:09.320
thank you very much.

14:17.880 --> 14:21.280
OK. Sure my note was
in there somewhere.

14:28.520 --> 14:31.600
No, no. I want no part
in this embarrassing spectacle,

14:31.600 --> 14:34.800
this circus of contrition!

14:34.800 --> 14:36.720
Oooh! That's a good name
for the band.

14:36.720 --> 14:38.320
Cool name. Yeah.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.840
Apoloclubby.

14:39.840 --> 14:40.880
Apothecary.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.960
Apottecaty.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.920
Apothecary.
Apoppercappy.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.920
Just say chemist.
No, no, no.

14:45.920 --> 14:48.280
Come on. Come on. Ugh.

14:48.280 --> 14:49.760
Apothecary.

14:49.760 --> 14:51.520
Apolicecathery.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.800
No, no...

14:54.800 --> 14:57.240
No point wailing 'bout it.
You made your beds.

14:57.240 --> 15:01.040
Perhaps you'll think 'bout your
actions from this day hence.

15:03.480 --> 15:06.920
Justice is a fickle wench,

15:06.920 --> 15:08.920
but 'pon this occasion

15:08.920 --> 15:10.680
fairly served,

15:10.680 --> 15:13.280
for 'tis heartening indeed

15:13.280 --> 15:16.680
to feel not a licking flame,

15:16.680 --> 15:18.720
but the warmth
of a righteous sun.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.120
I think things are clearing up
a bit, Flo.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.600
No. I don't want a refund,
I want our pizza.

15:28.600 --> 15:30.480
What do you mean,

15:30.480 --> 15:32.760
you can't find the house?
It's the only house.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.520
If you're within three miles and
there's a building, that's us.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.920
Hello? Hello?

15:39.680 --> 15:42.920
slight change of plan.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.320
Today's picnic will be courtesy

15:44.320 --> 15:45.760
of the little shop
at the garage.

15:45.760 --> 15:49.040
But they only do crisps.
They do more than crisps.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.360
All right, I'll be back in ten.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.400
Er...

15:54.720 --> 15:57.080
Relax!
Yep.

15:59.160 --> 16:00.800
...poth...
...poth...

16:00.800 --> 16:04.040
...ecary. ..ecary. Apothecary. Apothgagary.

16:04.040 --> 16:07.320
Which is it? Which is it?

16:07.320 --> 16:09.480
It's all one thing - R&B.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.280
Like S&M.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.840
What's S&M?
Ah, well...

16:12.840 --> 16:15.360
More electronic, I think.
A lot of fun, a bit naughty.

16:15.360 --> 16:17.440
Is it a firm no to country?
I think it should be

16:17.440 --> 16:19.160
pop music.
Country is pop.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.800
Hey. Hey!

16:21.800 --> 16:24.480
Order! Orderrrr!

16:24.480 --> 16:26.480
Thank goodness.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.480
I don't think I had
a grenade-launcher in me.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.120
All this
petty squabbling.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.040
God knows
how they pulled off Band Aid.

16:32.040 --> 16:34.400
Ah, now, there's only one way
to pull off a Band-Aid -

16:34.400 --> 16:37.240
smooth, quick motion
against the grain of the hairs.

16:37.240 --> 16:41.040
No, no, Band Aid.
Christmas '84.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.360
Or were you already, er...?

16:44.560 --> 16:47.000
I was dead. Yes, I had passed.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.800
Blimey.
You really did go too soon.

16:49.960 --> 16:52.080
No, Band Aid
was a charity single,

16:52.080 --> 16:55.000
featuring all the top pop acts
of the day.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.640
Like S Club.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.280
Er, more like Culture Club.
Yeah. Was number one for ages.

16:59.280 --> 17:01.600
What, and they all
just mucked in?

17:01.600 --> 17:02.720
Like, sung it together?

17:02.720 --> 17:05.440
Yeah. They all kind of did
a little bit each, you know.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.280
Have you tried
a cheese and onion one

17:16.280 --> 17:17.560
with a roast beef one?

17:17.560 --> 17:19.040
Tastes like a pasty.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.040
I think I've tried
all the combinations now.

17:23.080 --> 17:25.600
Any luck with the bath?
Nearly there.

17:25.600 --> 17:27.840
Water pressure is a joke.
It doesn't matter.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.360
It doesn't need to be deep.

17:29.360 --> 17:32.080
I'll just sink anyway.
I'm mostly potato now.

17:32.080 --> 17:36.240
Mm, delicious. In that case,
your bath is drawn, m'lady.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.120
Oh, wow. You know those are for
sharing, right?

17:41.120 --> 17:42.680
Too late.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.680
It's not quite a day spa, but...

17:46.680 --> 17:48.240
No, it's perfect.

17:48.240 --> 17:49.720
You're the best.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.320
I am the best.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.520
Right, get in. We've got 34 minutes
if you want to make the cinema.

17:54.520 --> 17:55.960
Go, go, go.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.680
Oooh...

18:00.960 --> 18:04.200
Oh. Wine. Er, one sec.

18:08.680 --> 18:12.720
Yeah, and Robin,
Captain and then Kitty to end.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.880
Should I not...?
Kitty to end.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.480
OK, here we go.

18:17.480 --> 18:22.200
A-one. A-two.
A-one, two, three...

18:27.640 --> 18:32.560
OK. A-one, a-two.
A-one, two, thr...

18:38.040 --> 18:39.400
In a-one...

18:39.400 --> 18:41.120
Got it.

18:41.120 --> 18:46.160
Now, I know today hasn't been
entirely plain sailing so far,

18:46.160 --> 18:47.880
but I am about
to turn it around.

18:47.880 --> 18:51.160
Because, tonight,
we are dining

18:51.160 --> 18:52.280
at the French place.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.000
Mm-hm!
Mm!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.240
Ooh la la!
Ooh la...

18:55.240 --> 18:56.640
Let me just give them a call

18:56.640 --> 18:58.120
and check that they've got
a table.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.160
Actually,
I should've done that first.

19:00.160 --> 19:01.520
Er...

19:01.520 --> 19:02.800
Bonjour.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.640
Er, I am just wondering
if you have a table tonight

19:05.640 --> 19:07.160
for two, around eight-ish?

19:08.240 --> 19:10.080
You can squeeze us in?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.120
Yes!
Wonderful.

19:11.120 --> 19:12.680
Merci. Yes, the name is, erm...

19:12.680 --> 19:14.720
Argh! Phone. No.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.680
Oh!
Wine! Waah!

19:16.680 --> 19:19.200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.520
Fine. You shower off,
I'll call 'em back.

19:23.520 --> 19:25.520
Oh, it's in my hair!
Where's your phone?

19:25.520 --> 19:27.080
Oh, it's on the be...

19:27.080 --> 19:28.280
Oh! Oh!
What now?

19:28.280 --> 19:29.640
No more hot!

19:31.320 --> 19:32.640
Argh!

19:32.640 --> 19:34.720
Oh, hello? Yes, we were
just on the phone...

19:35.760 --> 19:37.520
No, no, no, that's just my wife screaming.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.680
I was just talking to you
earlier about a table

19:39.680 --> 19:42.480
when we got... You're kidding me!
It was like one minute ago.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.080
Fine, but you're telling
my wife.

19:45.080 --> 19:47.920
Hello? Hello?

19:47.920 --> 19:49.360
Table's gone.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.120
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.600
You have to listen
to what I am doing.

20:05.960 --> 20:07.400
I mean, come on.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.240
One is reminded
of Battersea Dogs Home.

20:09.240 --> 20:12.400
Really? Was there a fire?

20:18.920 --> 20:20.440
Perfick.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.200
Hardly!
You were nowhere near my note.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.200
Yeah. I think maybe
piano need tuning.

20:25.200 --> 20:28.520
Yeah, so, you know,
we might need to tweak the end.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.320
But, overall, I think
that went pretty well.

20:31.320 --> 20:32.360
You know? I mean,

20:32.360 --> 20:34.240
some parts were better
than others.

20:34.240 --> 20:37.360
But with a bit of polish,

20:37.360 --> 20:40.280
well, it would be a cold heart
not to be won over

20:40.280 --> 20:41.480
by the sentiment.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.320
Well, it did nothing for me.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.360
Right, then,
once more from the top?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.880
We're probably going to have
to burn the towels, but, erm...

20:52.880 --> 20:54.200
No, no, no, no.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.800
What?
No cleaning. Day off.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.120
Well, we missed the cinema,
so I thought...

20:59.120 --> 21:02.040
No. This is the cinema.
Your own private cinema.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.520
The AlisOdeon.

21:04.520 --> 21:05.960
The AlisCineworld?

21:05.960 --> 21:08.720
Oh, yeah. The Alis...

21:08.720 --> 21:10.680
No, there's no more.
All right. Come on,

21:10.680 --> 21:13.240
the feature presentation
is about to begin.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.400
Hooray. OK.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.200
What is it?

21:17.200 --> 21:19.200
I think I found
the perfect chill-out movie.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.520
It's only 90 minutes long

21:20.520 --> 21:22.520
and it could not sound
more relaxing.

21:22.520 --> 21:23.960
A Quiet Place.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.360
Ooh.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.160
Well, that is
the most traumatic thing

21:35.160 --> 21:36.280
I will see today.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.160
Alison,
we've written you a song!

21:38.160 --> 21:39.280
Here we go.

21:39.280 --> 21:41.280
I may have spoken too soon.

21:41.280 --> 21:42.400
What?

21:43.440 --> 21:44.640
Oh, front row!

21:45.600 --> 21:46.920
Right.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.080
No, no...

21:52.080 --> 21:54.640
What are they doing?

21:54.640 --> 21:57.280
Er, I'm looking at it,
and I don't know.

22:51.720 --> 22:54.440
RAPS # Oh, my heart doth pine
for that face divine

23:05.880 --> 23:07.920
This is not in the tone
of the piece.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.520
Skip to the end.

23:12.760 --> 23:15.000
Now, Kitty!
I can't.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.760
Oh!

23:20.480 --> 23:22.000
Apothecary.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.040
Apologies.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.600
Oh, you know, what he say.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.200
At the end of the day,
you know, sorry.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.800
That felt weird.
You have no idea.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.600
Yeah, well, it was a little
rough around the edges.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.280
And further apologies
for the middle eight...

23:36.280 --> 23:37.400
Yeah. She liked it!

23:37.400 --> 23:39.840
But, you know,
you get the idea.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.000
We really are very sorry, Alison.

23:43.840 --> 23:45.320
Sorry for what?

23:45.320 --> 23:48.840
Well, for, er,
what happened, erm...

23:48.840 --> 23:50.720
...earlier.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.240
What did happen earlier?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.520
Why... Why was I upset?

23:59.960 --> 24:02.040
No, no, no!

24:03.080 --> 24:06.760
It's no one thing,
or one person.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.480
And it's not just today.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.560
It's that, every day,
we are breaking our backs

24:13.560 --> 24:15.320
to make this guest-house work,

24:15.320 --> 24:18.400
and I'm already waiting
on eight people.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.160
Nine. Every day,

24:20.160 --> 24:21.320
it's "Turn that page,"

24:21.320 --> 24:22.840
"Oh, it's time
for my programme,"

24:22.840 --> 24:24.920
or, "Google this horse,"

24:24.920 --> 24:28.480
and without even a word
of thanks.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.400
No, I don't want an apology.

24:31.440 --> 24:35.160
And I don't want
some big song and dance.

24:35.160 --> 24:38.440
I just want, like,
a little bit of thought

24:38.440 --> 24:40.440
and a little bit of help.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.160
Yes, of course you can't help,

24:43.160 --> 24:45.520
but do you really
have to not help

24:45.520 --> 24:48.680
24 hours a day?

25:00.840 --> 25:02.080
I think that might be

25:02.080 --> 25:04.320
the second most
we've ever been told off.

25:04.320 --> 25:05.360
Yeah.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.200
I think you guys
should probably go.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.320
OK. I'm going to go out
on a limb here and say

25:15.320 --> 25:20.280
it's possible that you're still
a little bit stressed. Hmm?

25:20.280 --> 25:21.640
Sorry.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.400
I know you really tried.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.000
Not hard enough, though.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.240
What?

25:26.240 --> 25:28.040
You did everything. I...

25:29.720 --> 25:31.000
Give me the list.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.360
That's what I want to do today.

25:44.360 --> 25:47.360
We can squeeze that in.
Yeah? Yeah.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.200
Best bit of the day.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.840
Mmm.

26:09.840 --> 26:11.560
Oh.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.320
Someone's posted a new review.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.880
Any good?

26:15.920 --> 26:18.440
Yeah. Amazing.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.640
But we don't have any guests.

26:23.640 --> 26:25.080
Better?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.720
Still a bit crampy
around the knuckle.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.360
I've been on it ten minutes. Hey.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.240
You?

26:33.240 --> 26:34.560
Ah.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.920
Just the typing.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.600
We all composed a bit.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.120
And helped to edit Thomas's.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.040
But she is a radiant beauty.
Is off topic!

26:43.040 --> 26:45.360
That is really,
really lovely, guys.

26:45.360 --> 26:48.840
But you have to delete it.
It's like cheating or...

26:48.840 --> 26:50.360
Nonsense.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.920
We are guests in your house
every day.

26:52.920 --> 26:56.600
And you are
the most incredible hosts.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.240
Yes. Every word's the truth.

27:00.240 --> 27:01.720
"We never wanted to leave."

27:01.720 --> 27:03.880
Bit of luck, eh?

27:06.640 --> 27:08.800
Thanks, guys.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.560
Friends?

27:11.600 --> 27:12.840
Friends.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.240
Aw!

27:18.800 --> 27:22.120
You see?
We're closer... together.

27:22.120 --> 27:24.440
Yeah. It sounds better
now that you...

27:24.440 --> 27:25.800
What?!

27:25.800 --> 27:28.160
But they be in the wrongs,
Al'son.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.720
Where be the punishment?
Where be the trial?

27:30.720 --> 27:32.680
Oh, no. Oh, no, Mary, we've...

27:32.680 --> 27:34.080
We've made up.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.840
Made up?

27:35.840 --> 27:37.320
But... But I was...

27:37.320 --> 27:39.840
Have you forgottens?

27:39.840 --> 27:43.000
Now, you listen to me,
Alison Coopers!

27:47.120 --> 27:49.840
I think that might be the most
I've ever been told off.
