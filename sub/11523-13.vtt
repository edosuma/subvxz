WEBVTT

00:06.923 --> 00:09.467
Oh, your mail is so boring.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.136
Cyndee met a rabbit.

00:11.219 --> 00:14.556
Donna Maria's mole sauce is in <i>goop.</i>

00:14.639 --> 00:17.976
Leah Remini joined Gretchen's church.

00:18.059 --> 00:20.437
Who cares?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.188
Wait, you're leaving already?

00:22.272 --> 00:24.107
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

00:24.190 --> 00:27.902
Lillian, the Carnivore Cruise Lines
flagship ship <i>Ocean Skank</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:30.613
leaves in two days,
and this girl's got a mom to find.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.008
We'll be back before you know it.

00:32.031 --> 00:33.074
Yeah?

00:33.158 --> 00:35.035
W-what if Titus gets discovered

00:35.118 --> 00:38.621
and moves to LA and gets big fake breasts?

00:38.705 --> 00:41.166
I don't want to see him like that.

00:41.249 --> 00:43.460
And you're gonna find your real mom,

00:43.543 --> 00:46.963
and then you won't need
your fake mom anymore.

00:47.046 --> 00:50.258
I'll be all alone,
just like after Roland left.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.135
Was shot in the face by you.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.595
Look, if you get lonely,

00:53.678 --> 00:55.346
just watch some of my old audition tapes.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.866
Maybe you can appreciate them in a way

00:56.890 --> 00:58.808
that Dick Wolf's snooty doorman could not.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.312
Go if you're gonna go.
I'm used to being ignored.

01:02.395 --> 01:04.522
Mm-hmm,
remember when you chained yourself

01:04.605 --> 01:07.484
to that bulldozer for a week
and no one noticed or cared?

01:07.567 --> 01:09.287
I'll bring you back
a real Florida souvenir,

01:09.360 --> 01:10.862
like a python or a gun!

01:16.242 --> 01:18.244
Don't worry about me.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.330
I'll just be here

01:20.413 --> 01:22.540
smelling your clothes,

01:22.624 --> 01:25.418
wondering if you're ever coming back,

01:25.502 --> 01:29.047
my voice getting quieter and quieter

01:29.130 --> 01:32.175
until I can't be heard at all.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.260
And what difference will that make?

01:34.344 --> 01:36.805
Quit being a bummer, Lillian!

01:38.181 --> 01:40.225
What if I get seasick?

01:40.308 --> 01:42.435
Why do boats float and Tituses sink?

01:43.603 --> 01:46.403
What if a sea witch says I can meet
Prince Eric if I give her my voice?

01:46.481 --> 01:47.690
I do it, right?

01:47.774 --> 01:49.668
Are you even listening
to what I'm saying to you?

01:49.692 --> 01:51.569
Sorry. I've got a lot on my mind.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.071
I rented a car for the first time.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.823
I declined gator insurance,

01:54.906 --> 01:56.324
which has proven to be a mistake.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.451
- Not again!
- That's 11.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.246
And tomorrow I'm gonna ambush my mom
at the Rip Ride Rockit,

02:01.329 --> 02:05.208
and then all that drama you always told me
to save for my mama?

02:05.291 --> 02:07.168
Well, I did.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.795
Sweetheart, maybe I should go with you

02:09.878 --> 02:11.131
so that I can film it.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.799
No. You have to get to Miami.

02:12.882 --> 02:15.176
And I've got to do this alone.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.595
When I visualize this meeting,
like Andrea told me to...

02:17.679 --> 02:18.972
- Drivinghighway!
- Oh!

02:20.932 --> 02:24.060
Lori-Ann Schmidt is not a lady who says,
"I'm sorry."

02:24.144 --> 02:26.980
Even when you're supposed to,
like in a board game scenario.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.208
But I'm gonna tell her
everything I've been thinking about

02:29.232 --> 02:30.608
for the last 15 years.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.610
And she will apologize.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.904
Girl, let me see you do one of these.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.156
Unh-unh.

02:36.781 --> 02:37.699
Uh-uh.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.159
Take it back. Undo it.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.119
No, sirree...

02:41.202 --> 02:42.370
Bob.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.796
Bar mitzvah.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.049
I'd like to sell these.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.511
Tomorrow I need an apartment
full of expensive furniture

02:58.595 --> 03:00.179
for a catered Thanksgiving.

03:00.263 --> 03:03.182
My boyfriend's family is coming
from Washington.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.476
I mean, not boyfriend, I guess.

03:05.560 --> 03:06.978
I mean, fingers crossed,

03:07.061 --> 03:08.855
but he doesn't want to russ it...

03:08.938 --> 03:11.232
"Russ"? What am I talking about?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.568
- His name is Russ.
- I get it.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.236
My wife's name is Shira,

03:15.320 --> 03:18.323
which sounds like She-Ra,
He-Man's sister.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.074
So that's fun.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.202
These are good quality.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.496
You were hot piece rich man?

03:25.580 --> 03:27.498
I was. Thank you.

03:27.582 --> 03:31.502
But now I'm falling in love
for the first time.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.672
I finally understand what
all those love songs are talking about,

03:34.756 --> 03:37.425
like Sheena Easton's "Sugar Walls."

03:38.092 --> 03:39.385
No, sorry.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.637
Not this one.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.267
I just don't know if Russ feels
the same way about me.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.936
If I could win over his family...

03:48.019 --> 03:49.062
Family is key,

03:49.145 --> 03:51.439
but take everything I say
with grain of salt

03:51.522 --> 03:53.524
because I was, how you say,

03:53.608 --> 03:54.859
shot in brain by robber.

03:56.000 --> 04:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.466 --> 04:21.803
Wow, Beverly Hills.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.514
I feel like a prostitute
getting a necklace.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.848
Oh! Hey, little guy.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.767
Get in there, Jayden. Say hi to...

04:27.850 --> 04:29.394
- Smile with...
- Irish Dora.

04:29.477 --> 04:30.687
Whoville Lady or whatever.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.980
Oh, I'm not a character here.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.063
Give her a kiss, Jayden.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.483
Thanks, but I'm Kimmy.

04:35.566 --> 04:36.943
You hear that? It's Kimmy.

04:37.026 --> 04:39.129
Now take a picture with it
and let's get back to the Camry

04:39.153 --> 04:40.780
'cause I'm done.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.324
Come on.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.705
I'm just a person.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.711
Okay, look for the telltale signs
of coasterheads:

04:54.794 --> 04:56.587
no kids, strap-on sunglasses,

04:56.671 --> 04:57.964
airbrushed clothes,

04:58.047 --> 04:59.367
water pistols full of margaritas.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.384
Got to stay hydrated.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.012
- Go ahead.
- Do it.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.972
Mommy.

05:06.931 --> 05:08.141
Lori-Ann Schmidt!

05:09.600 --> 05:11.144
I've got some stuff to say to you.

05:14.063 --> 05:15.106
Baby!

05:16.357 --> 05:18.651
My baby! Ha-ha.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.653
Ah.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.739
Oh, God, you're alive!

05:22.822 --> 05:24.365
I love you so much.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.451
Kimmy, I'm so sorry, baby.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.119
I'm so sorry.

05:28.202 --> 05:31.164
Oh, my God, you're alive!

05:31.247 --> 05:34.292
This is my baby!

05:34.375 --> 05:36.794
My baby is alive!

05:36.878 --> 05:42.133
Lori-Ann! Lori-Ann!
Lori-Ann! Lori-Ann!

05:42.216 --> 05:44.343
Lori-Ann! Lori-Ann!

06:13.456 --> 06:15.083
You look real pretty.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.000
Thanks, Mom.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.293
You too.

06:17.376 --> 06:21.047
But I, uh, was kind of hoping
I could talk to you alone.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.341
Oh, Joe and them are like family to me.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.634
And it's Thanksgiving.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.636
Yeah, but I actually am family.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.514
That scar on his neck
goes all the way around.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.390
Got decapitated in '96

06:31.474 --> 06:32.874
when I stood up on the Grim Reaper.

06:32.934 --> 06:36.020
The whole middle part of his neck
is pig neck.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.564
Look, Mom.

06:38.648 --> 06:40.167
I have some stuff I need to say to you...

06:40.191 --> 06:43.069
Oh, baby, I tried everything to find you:

06:43.152 --> 06:44.612
made T-shirts,

06:44.695 --> 06:46.489
walked through the woods in a arm chain.

06:46.572 --> 06:47.406
I know...

06:47.490 --> 06:49.659
Heck, I spent so much time
at that police station,

06:49.742 --> 06:52.954
I ended up marrying the guy
who was in charge of your investigation.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.039
Figured if anyone could find you,
he could.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.209
He was smart and cool,
like Jimmy Smits.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.336
- I've met Randy.
- Never mind, then.

07:00.419 --> 07:03.131
- Mom, I...
- But I never gave up hope.

07:06.509 --> 07:07.760
You know what? Look.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.012
I still have the Christmas present
I was gonna give you

07:10.096 --> 07:11.848
that year you got...

07:11.931 --> 07:13.766
Anyway, I carry it with me everywhere.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.394
"Mom's Super Fun Christmas Coupon Book."

07:16.477 --> 07:18.729
Yeah.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.566
"Foot Rub,"

07:21.649 --> 07:23.943
"Pancakes For Dinner,"

07:24.026 --> 07:26.070
"Try One Cigarette."

07:26.154 --> 07:29.365
Oh, it was '98, before people knew
cigarettes were bad.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.534
Now I only smoke cinnamon Parliaments.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.871
This one says you'll take me to see
<i>Patch Adams.</i>

07:34.954 --> 07:37.039
Yeah, and I will now.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.499
I always knew I'd find you.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.168
But you left Durnsville.

07:40.251 --> 07:42.503
I know, right? It was so frustrating.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.839
I couldn't stay.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.642
Everywhere I went,
people were looking at me

07:46.716 --> 07:48.509
like I was a bummer, you know,

07:48.593 --> 07:50.011
with their eyes all watery,

07:50.094 --> 07:51.888
"I'm so sorry for your tragedy,"

07:51.971 --> 07:55.057
when I just was trying
to get one minute of peace

07:55.141 --> 07:56.934
on a mechanical bull.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.312
Six or seven years of that, and I just...

07:59.395 --> 08:02.148
I had to haul ass, honey.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.859
I just couldn't stand
people looking at me like that.

08:04.942 --> 08:06.360
Ugh. I hate that look.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.987
I don't want pity.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.790
It's like, I'm more than this one
terrible thing that happened to me.

08:10.865 --> 08:11.699
Exactly.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.035
I'm all the terrible things
that have happened to me.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.412
And I'm not a bummer. I'm fun.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.997
- You are fun.
- I know.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.415
I'm like a box of puppies

08:19.499 --> 08:21.834
that got found by chimps on Christmas.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.544
All fun. Period.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.922
I mean,
I'm about to break the female record

08:26.005 --> 08:30.259
for most rides on a German-designed
steel X-coaster.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.222
Back in Indiana, they just wanted me
to be sad all the time.

08:34.304 --> 08:37.600
I never thought about how hard
it must have been for you too.

08:37.683 --> 08:38.976
Lori-Ann, heads up,

08:39.059 --> 08:40.977
we got the Rockit again in seven minutes.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.067
I'll do it later.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.110
I'm gonna get Kimmy and I
new express passes

08:48.194 --> 08:49.987
so me and her can ride that thing
together.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.406
But, Lori-Ann,
you'll have to wait for hours.

08:52.490 --> 08:55.201
Yeah, you don't have to do that.

08:55.284 --> 08:56.827
Lori-Ann, you are crazy.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.747
No. What? No.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.165
Want to kill some time with me?

09:01.249 --> 09:03.125
Get our fun on?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.670
Can our fun include "Cartwheel Race"?

09:05.753 --> 09:06.837
It can't not.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.134
Hurry up! Hurry!

09:29.652 --> 09:32.071
- You coming or not?
- I don't know.

09:32.154 --> 09:33.739
Is this cruise the right thing to do?

09:33.823 --> 09:36.450
- Sir, this is a bus.
- It's four months.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.202
I've never been on a boat before.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.913
And what if my choreography
requires standing?

09:41.956 --> 09:45.209
I know I don't often pray,
but if you're listening,

09:45.293 --> 09:49.046
Black Jesus from the Madonna
"Like a Prayer" video, give me a sign.

09:52.675 --> 09:55.094
"Titusville"?

09:55.177 --> 09:57.722
Okay, Black Jesus,
that's a little on the nose,

09:57.805 --> 09:59.098
but I trust you.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.696
<i>Now to the video the entire city
has been buzzing about.</i>

10:13.779 --> 10:16.449
<i>It is cell phone footage
of an uptown Manhattanite</i>

10:16.532 --> 10:18.284
<i>going on the ride of her life.</i>

10:18.367 --> 10:20.536
<i>Evidently this woman fell asleep</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:23.122
<i>while protesting a new development
in East Dogmouth,</i>

10:23.205 --> 10:26.751
<i>and she continued to snooze
as construction resumed.</i>

10:26.834 --> 10:28.878
'Cause I'd had a lot of turkey.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.721
<i>Despite the attention
over the protest,</i>

10:30.796 --> 10:33.591
<i>developers say they are still on schedule</i>

10:33.674 --> 10:35.885
<i>and the video may have actually
raised awareness</i>

10:35.968 --> 10:37.887
<i>about the neighborhood
among Internet-havers.</i>

10:37.970 --> 10:40.431
What? No.

10:40.514 --> 10:43.434
Someone did notice me,

10:43.517 --> 10:46.520
and it made everything worse.

10:52.777 --> 10:53.611
Thank you!

10:53.694 --> 10:55.988
No one in New York
ever wants to high-five.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.114
That's dumb.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.534
What do they do
when Truckasaurus eats a car?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.246
Who is this guy?

11:04.330 --> 11:07.500
Do kids like Cheese Businessman?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.507
My name is Inga.

11:14.590 --> 11:19.387
I came all da vay from Sweden
to dis vacation.

11:19.470 --> 11:22.139
And I came from Jamaica, now.

11:22.223 --> 11:25.476
My name is a-Terence a-Trent a-D'arby.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.980
So, you ready to face your fears
and eat this worm?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.775
You want me to eat a worm? Oh, no.

11:32.858 --> 11:35.820
I've never had to eat
anything gross before.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.696
- Psych!
- Eat the worm, honey.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.615
The prize is sweatbands!

12:00.219 --> 12:03.431
My wife, Kirsten, loves this design stuff.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.394
For her birthday, I bought her
a master's of interior design from DePaul.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.312
- She knows all the colors now.
- Mm.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.398
Can you believe she's had four kids?

12:13.691 --> 12:16.318
Honey, show Jacqueline the back.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.903
There you go.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.613
Want to bounce a quarter off that?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.782
A quarter? What's a quarter?

12:21.866 --> 12:23.617
Right answer.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.743
I like you.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.873
Hey, sorry I'm late.

12:28.956 --> 12:32.001
I-I had a pumpkin pie,
but I sat on it on the subway,

12:32.084 --> 12:35.713
and the only store I could find open
was a Talbots, so...

12:35.796 --> 12:37.173
Hey, Duke... Oh!

12:37.256 --> 12:38.507
What are you doing, Russ?

12:38.591 --> 12:39.776
Why are you staring at the walls?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.969
Say hi to Jacqueline.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.888
Ha-ha, that's funny. Hi, Jacqueline.

12:43.971 --> 12:46.724
Duke, has Jacqueline met
Russ' last girlfriend?

12:46.807 --> 12:48.368
Pleased to meet you.

12:48.392 --> 12:50.311
I'm Handgela.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.522
How do you do?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.359
This one's a keeper, Russ.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.945
Go easy on him, boys. He can't help it.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.697
His name is Russ.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.948
You named me that.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.993
Oh, Russ had to be named by his daddy.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.998
Jacqueline, you are a pretty girl.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.500
Him and you have a kid,

13:12.583 --> 13:15.085
your genes might water all that down.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.378
Oh, Mr. Snyder...

13:16.462 --> 13:17.671
Oh, please, call me Orson.

13:17.755 --> 13:18.881
Well, Orson,

13:18.964 --> 13:21.050
I would love to water that down,

13:21.133 --> 13:22.301
if he'll have me.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.553
He should be so lucky.

13:25.679 --> 13:27.973
I once caught him kissing a bird.

13:28.057 --> 13:32.019
Yeah. He said it was CPR.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.604
Then why the tongue?

13:33.687 --> 13:35.731
Huh?

13:39.818 --> 13:41.153
Welcome to Titusville,

13:41.237 --> 13:42.988
home of the Kennedy Space Center.

13:43.072 --> 13:46.617
In 1962, John F. Kennedy was inspired
to go to the moon

13:46.700 --> 13:49.870
while feeling up a particularly buxom
coat-check girl.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.915
Uh-huh, anyway, I was sent here by fate.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.000
See, my name is Titus.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.585
Oh, how cute.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.462
Obviously, I had to come and see my town.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.297
What is there to do here?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.675
Titus-friendly attractions, I assume?

14:02.758 --> 14:04.385
Interactive couch museum,

14:04.468 --> 14:07.096
a "shirts required" swimming pool?

14:07.179 --> 14:09.265
- Food?
- Sure, we have restaurants.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.768
But Titusville is best known as being home
of the U.S. space program.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.771
Okay, I like space.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.941
Ever since I was a child,
I was always fascinated

14:19.024 --> 14:21.527
by Major Tony Nelson's
failed space flight:

14:21.610 --> 14:24.154
his capsule crash-landing
on a desert island,

14:24.238 --> 14:26.949
knocking over a genie bottle,
releasing Barbara Eden.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.285
Thank you, NASA.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.953
She was his slave.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.746
Oh, well.

14:32.830 --> 14:34.832
Uh, would you like to enter our raffle?

14:34.915 --> 14:37.251
Win dinner with a real astronaut?

14:37.334 --> 14:40.254
Of course astronauts live in Titusville.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.548
I bet this town is full of heroes.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.216
Well, our founder, Colonel Henry Titus,

14:44.300 --> 14:46.802
would have been a Civil War hero
if the right side had won.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.638
I'll allow it.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.353
Good luck.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.650
Hey, uh...

15:03.027 --> 15:05.029
Uh, oh!

15:07.448 --> 15:09.575
My neighborhood is ruined.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.202
And it's my fault.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.787
I did it.

15:13.871 --> 15:16.332
Just like O.J. Simpson...

15:18.083 --> 15:21.211
against the Dolphins in '69.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.923
Twelve yards on ten carries?

15:24.006 --> 15:26.216
Well, unforgivable.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.538
Titus, I did it. I found her.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.415
I'm so happy for you, Baked Kimberlay's.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.060
Did you tell her everything
you wanted to say?

16:00.084 --> 16:01.460
Did you throw white wine on her?

16:01.543 --> 16:02.378
<i>I didn't have to.</i>

16:02.461 --> 16:03.963
She apologized right away.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.006
<i>- She even cried.</i>
- Wait.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.591
What do you mean "right away"?

16:07.675 --> 16:08.968
She didn't let you say anything?

16:09.051 --> 16:12.388
Um, I said, "Lori-Ann Schmidt!"

16:12.471 --> 16:13.472
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

16:13.555 --> 16:14.658
And when you went to confront her,

16:14.682 --> 16:16.684
did she keep a random friend there
as a buffer?

16:16.767 --> 16:19.061
You mean Joe?
I don't even think he was listening.

16:19.144 --> 16:21.689
His head was, like,
all the way the other way.

16:21.772 --> 16:24.024
Oh, Lori-Ann's good.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.318
I did not realize she was a Get-A-Header.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.945
- What does that even mean?
- Ugh.

16:28.028 --> 16:31.073
"Get-A-Heading"...
trademark my ex-friend Timothy...

16:31.156 --> 16:33.158
It's when you take control of a situation

16:33.242 --> 16:35.327
by saying negative things
before anyone else can,

16:35.411 --> 16:37.579
like when Madonna said "Dangerous Game"
was terrible

16:37.663 --> 16:38.956
before the critics could

16:39.039 --> 16:40.374
or how I'm telling you right now

16:40.457 --> 16:41.709
I didn't go to Miami.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.645
I'm in a town called Titusville,
and I love it here.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.045
Wait, what?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.964
You don't "wait, what" me.
I "wait, what" you.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.692
<i>If you haven't told your mother
how you feel</i>

16:48.716 --> 16:51.218
but you think you two are all good,
you are lying to yourself.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.262
Oh, I'm lying to myself?

16:53.345 --> 16:54.847
You're supposed to be in Miami.

16:54.930 --> 16:57.057
Jeez, Titus, I thought we were past this,

16:57.141 --> 16:59.184
but you're just hiding
from the real world again.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.686
Or maybe I found where I belong.

17:00.769 --> 17:02.146
There's a space museum here.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.522
Since when do you care about space?

17:04.606 --> 17:06.983
Weightlessness, non-melting ice cream,

17:07.067 --> 17:08.318
buff scientists.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.862
I think the burden's on you to prove

17:09.944 --> 17:12.031
that I haven't cared about space
this entire time.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.342
I know you're afraid Mikey won't be there
when you get back.

17:14.366 --> 17:15.951
<i>You're afraid of failure.</i>

17:16.035 --> 17:18.412
Also success, birds, escalators...

17:18.494 --> 17:20.622
We Titusvillians are afraid of nothing,

17:20.705 --> 17:23.250
not the moon, not the Union Army,

17:23.333 --> 17:26.045
not this sinkhole that keeps...

17:26.127 --> 17:27.171
Whatever.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.840
All I know is, I got what I came here for.

17:29.923 --> 17:31.216
She apologized.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.926
<i>Titus?</i>

17:33.010 --> 17:34.887
<i>Hello?</i>

17:34.970 --> 17:38.140
Lori-Ann Schmidt is playing you
'cause she doesn't want to deal.

17:38.223 --> 17:39.141
<i>You just watch.</i>

17:39.224 --> 17:41.393
<i>If she even gets a whiff
of anything serious,</i>

17:41.477 --> 17:42.728
she'll just change the subject

17:42.811 --> 17:45.397
faster than a theoretical
speed-of-light spacecraft

17:45.481 --> 17:47.107
on which I would age more slowly.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.942
See? I love space!

17:52.362 --> 17:54.323
Oh, the game's almost on!

17:54.406 --> 17:56.206
Hey, Jacqueline,
you're not one of those girls

17:56.241 --> 17:57.618
who don't like football, are you?

17:57.701 --> 18:00.120
Are you kidding? I hate those women.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.789
I love football.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.001
We Snyders love our football.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.711
We all had to play it in high school.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.339
- Don't! I'm not open yet!
- Ha-ha!

18:10.422 --> 18:12.883
<i>We're minutes away from kickoff
here in Dallas</i>

18:12.966 --> 18:15.969
<i>as the Cowboys prepare to take on
the, uh...</i>

18:16.053 --> 18:18.180
<i>team that is from Washington.</i>

18:18.263 --> 18:21.850
<i>And what a game we have for you today.</i>

18:23.393 --> 18:26.772
So you guys are Redskins fans?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.857
Well, I don't want to brag, but, uh,

18:28.941 --> 18:30.526
we kind of own the team.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.778
How is that not the first thing
you say to women?

18:32.861 --> 18:34.655
Huh? What do you lead with,
your foot nipple?

18:34.738 --> 18:36.490
- No.
- Hmm.

18:36.573 --> 18:39.118
Honey, we've owned the Redskins
since 1938.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.203
You see, while the team was driving
to Philadelphia

18:41.286 --> 18:43.539
for a game,
they got lost on my grandfather's land,

18:43.622 --> 18:45.833
and in exchange for the trademark,
he let them live.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.296
But don't you think the name is a little,

18:51.380 --> 18:53.298
uh, old-fashioned?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.842
Exactly. It's been around forever.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.844
And I happen to respect tradition.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.762
It's why I get operated on by my barber.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.807
And the name is honoring
those Native guys.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.517
It's saying they're tough.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.437
Plus, how do you know that "Redskins"
isn't about potatoes?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.730
Bingo.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.318
It's just some people find it offensive...

19:13.402 --> 19:15.487
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Jacqueline, look,

19:15.571 --> 19:18.532
some of my best statues are of Indians.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.826
And the Redskins' very first coach
was Lone Star Dietz,

19:20.909 --> 19:22.744
a man who pretended to be Indian

19:22.828 --> 19:24.663
so that he could get out of World War I.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.039
That's right.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.709
<i>♪ Heil to the Redskins ♪</i>

19:28.792 --> 19:32.045
<i>♪ Scalp the other team ♪</i>

19:32.129 --> 19:35.799
<i>♪ Celebrate with fire water ♪</i>

19:35.883 --> 19:38.927
<i>♪ Help Germany win the war ♪</i>

19:45.934 --> 19:49.605
Man, a ball pit is definitely
my favorite kind of pit.

19:50.355 --> 19:52.107
Sweetie, get your shoes on.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.818
I just realized this watch we found
in Fievel's Playland

19:54.902 --> 19:56.278
was set to mountain.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.405
Rip Ride Rockit's in ten minutes.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.990
See you, guys! You're the best.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.325
You're too big.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.994
Kimmy, we got to go.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.205
Mom, I'm hurrying.

20:06.288 --> 20:08.999
If we miss this, I don't get
another chance to break my record.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.876
I just got to get my shoes on.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.886
Oh, my gah.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.679
Why can't you do that any faster?

20:22.763 --> 20:24.681
Because you never taught me
how to tie my shoes.

20:25.265 --> 20:29.978
Then the bunny's ear
goes around the other ear and into...

20:30.062 --> 20:32.022
Why would he put his ear inside himself?

20:32.105 --> 20:34.524
We've been working on this for a year!

20:34.608 --> 20:36.151
Who raised you?

20:36.235 --> 20:37.945
- Huh?
- Oh!

20:38.028 --> 20:40.864
Bunny wraps one ear around the other ear,

20:40.948 --> 20:42.491
pokes it into his skull,

20:42.574 --> 20:43.992
'cause he has his reasons.

20:46.370 --> 20:49.373
Why can't you just wear them Velcro shoes
like I used to get you?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.083
Because Velcro freaks me out now.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.459
I don't know why.

20:52.542 --> 20:53.770
Maybe it's something the Reverend would...

20:53.794 --> 20:56.213
Ah, what? Come on, let's not...

20:57.130 --> 20:58.590
You know what? I'm going.

21:01.510 --> 21:03.428
We've got time!

21:06.265 --> 21:08.016
Titus was right.

21:10.894 --> 21:11.770
Ow!

21:11.853 --> 21:14.564
Ugh.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.025
Ugh. Mom!

21:21.488 --> 21:24.032
I tried everything I could think of

21:24.116 --> 21:27.744
to keep this neighborhood weird
and dangerous.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.747
Now the only thing left to do

21:30.831 --> 21:33.458
is to sell to some yuppie creeps,

21:33.542 --> 21:34.876
take the money,

21:34.960 --> 21:38.547
and leave a good-looking corpse
in Waikiki.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.383
Then I travel the world.

21:44.177 --> 21:48.515
What white creep in a suit
is this gonna be?

21:50.058 --> 21:52.352
Ms. Kaushtupper?
I saw you on New York One.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.771
- It was inspiring.
- "Inspiring"?

21:54.855 --> 21:57.232
What are you, an ironic hipster?

21:57.316 --> 22:00.068
My name is Winfred O'Prah.
I work for ISUS.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.945
- ISIS?
- ISUS.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.781
The Interborough Society
for Urban Settlement.

22:04.865 --> 22:07.451
We're devoted to curtailing
new development

22:07.534 --> 22:09.411
in New York's historic neighborhoods.

22:09.494 --> 22:12.122
Also, we had the name first.

22:12.205 --> 22:15.208
Ms. Kaushtupper, have you ever thought

22:15.292 --> 22:17.961
about running for office?

22:18.045 --> 22:21.048
I hadn't thought of that.

22:21.131 --> 22:24.384
"Mayor Kaushtupper Still At Large,

22:24.468 --> 22:29.056
colon, Authorities Baffled."

22:29.139 --> 22:31.683
Let's talk, you white prick.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.402
I can't believe I won that raffle.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.071
You know how I'm like an astronaut?

22:44.154 --> 22:45.614
I'm out of this world,

22:45.697 --> 22:48.116
and I once had to poop in a vacuum.

22:48.200 --> 22:50.077
I love Titusville.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.037
Ooh, you know what we should do?

22:52.120 --> 22:54.706
We should use "Titus"
the way Smurfs use "smurf."

22:54.790 --> 22:58.585
May I have a glass
of Titus with some Titus?

22:58.668 --> 23:01.546
But no Titus on it.
I'm deathly allergi-Titus.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.384
"That's one small soup for man,

23:06.468 --> 23:09.638
one giant sandwich for mankind."

23:09.721 --> 23:12.099
Hi, Titus, I'm your astronaut,
Captain Mooney.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.391
No pun intended.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.310
None gotten.

23:15.393 --> 23:18.146
- You're an astronaut?
- Mm-hmm.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.773
Prove it.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.399
Tell me a story about space.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.902
Oh, I've been to space many times.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.697
From a distance,
the Earth looks blue and green.

23:27.781 --> 23:31.326
And the snowcapped mountains? White.

23:31.409 --> 23:35.080
From a distance,
the ocean meets the stream,

23:35.163 --> 23:36.832
and the eagle takes to flight.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.458
Space Judas!

23:38.542 --> 23:40.782
Those are the lyrics to Bette Midler's
"From A Distance."

23:40.836 --> 23:42.963
- You're no astronaut.
- No, I am. Really.

23:43.046 --> 23:44.589
It's just...

23:44.673 --> 23:47.843
they shut down the manned space program
before I got to do anything.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.262
And I found out about it
in the worst way possible:

23:50.345 --> 23:52.931
from a very smug chimp.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.809
Ground Control to Major Confusion.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.520
I know that we stopped going to the moon

23:58.603 --> 24:02.232
because it kept changing shapes,
making landing impossible, but...

24:02.315 --> 24:03.400
Forget the moon.

24:03.483 --> 24:06.153
No one's gone to space at all since 2011.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.864
So space is like American Apparel?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.992
Titusville used to be a place
where we reached for the stars.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.368
Now we reach for the...

24:13.451 --> 24:15.370
free bread.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.042
I guess NASA decided it was too risky
to keep trying.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.961
They got scared.

24:23.044 --> 24:26.006
Now Titusville is just a place
where dreams go to die.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.883
Oh, God.

24:27.966 --> 24:31.178
If I stay here,
am I no better than a U.S. astronaut?

24:31.261 --> 24:33.513
I know. I'm pathetic.

24:33.597 --> 24:36.474
You spend your whole life training
to do something,

24:36.558 --> 24:38.310
and then it's not worth the risk?

24:38.393 --> 24:39.853
What a waste.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.689
Well, it's not too late for me.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.233
I can still get on my rocket ship
to the stars.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.820
Or in my case, a bus to a van to a boat.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.031
Failure is not an option.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.616
I'm not gonna end up like NASA:

24:52.699 --> 24:54.242
scared, afraid,

24:54.326 --> 24:57.245
standing for "Never Accomplishing
Space Anymore."

24:57.329 --> 24:58.622
I'm gonna go to Miami.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.750
And I'm gonna go to that place I saw
on <i>Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.</i>

25:01.833 --> 25:03.251
And then I'm getting on that boat.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.765
Hey, they're about to start
serving dinner.

25:16.848 --> 25:18.850
I can't see you anymore.

25:21.519 --> 25:24.898
Is this 'cause of that obvious lie
about the pumpkin pie?

25:24.981 --> 25:26.483
I soiled myself on the subway

25:26.566 --> 25:28.777
and I sat on the pie to cover it up, okay?

25:28.860 --> 25:30.862
No. I'm sorry, Russ.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.198
I really liked you,

25:33.281 --> 25:34.449
but the Redskins?

25:34.532 --> 25:36.284
How is that still a thing?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.205
These are my parents.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.832
My family is Lakota Sioux.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.793
On the rez, they call me...

25:44.876 --> 25:47.295
No one invited you, Yellow Head.

25:49.089 --> 25:51.883
I spent every penny I had
trying to help them,

25:51.967 --> 25:53.385
but nobody cared.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.779
And the fact that you don't care either,

25:54.803 --> 25:56.680
it's just too much.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.682
The truth is, I'm not rich
like I said I was.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.558
I don't own this apartment.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.603
And I can't tie a cherry stem into a knot
with my tongue.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.314
I just always keep one in my cheek
in case it comes up.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.486
But I would rather live on the street

26:11.569 --> 26:13.446
than be with a man who sings that song.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.407
I'm sorry, Russ. It's over.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.960
That is the hottest thing
I have ever heard.

26:27.043 --> 26:28.043
You care.

26:28.086 --> 26:29.629
Nobody cares...

26:29.713 --> 26:31.339
about anything.

26:33.258 --> 26:36.678
No, Russ. Your family owns the Redskins.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.388
You think I like these people?

26:38.471 --> 26:40.390
They're horrible.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.891
They told me I was adopted.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.143
When I was 18,

26:43.226 --> 26:46.354
I found out they were my real parents
all along.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.440
But why? Why?

26:48.523 --> 26:50.233
And that name?

26:50.317 --> 26:52.986
For years, I've been trying
to get them to change it

26:53.069 --> 26:55.238
to something cool like the Prancers

26:55.322 --> 26:59.534
or the Muscle Men or...

26:59.617 --> 27:00.618
Mystique.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.682
But every time I bring it up,
they force me to hit myself

27:04.706 --> 27:06.082
with my own girlfriend... hand.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.459
Hand.

27:07.542 --> 27:10.712
But maybe...

27:10.795 --> 27:12.922
together...

27:13.006 --> 27:16.843
We can take down the Washington Redskins.

27:16.926 --> 27:17.761
Yeah.

27:29.064 --> 27:30.106
Oh.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.319
Oink.

27:34.402 --> 27:37.238
Lori-Ann Schmidt,
I got some stuff to say to you!

27:39.157 --> 27:40.617
Why didn't you find me?

27:40.700 --> 27:43.453
You were supposed to look for me
until you found me.

27:43.536 --> 27:45.872
Not just for a while. Until.

27:45.955 --> 27:47.707
I bet you were glad I was gone,

27:47.791 --> 27:49.918
'cause you never wanted me
in the first place.

27:50.001 --> 27:52.670
Ahh! How is this fun?

27:56.091 --> 27:57.884
Ahh!

28:05.642 --> 28:09.187
You were a bad mom.
You were never there for me.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.730
I packed you lunch every day,

28:10.814 --> 28:12.482
and you never ate the fruit!

28:12.565 --> 28:15.860
- Ahh!
- Whoo-hoo!

28:15.944 --> 28:19.781
You were selfish, and you just wanted
to party like it was 1999,

28:19.864 --> 28:22.951
and it was only 1998!

28:23.034 --> 28:25.703
I am so mad at you,

28:25.787 --> 28:27.622
and I'm entitled to that emotion.

28:29.332 --> 28:33.128
We're going again.
I got some stuff to say.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.588
First of all, of course I didn't want you.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.758
I was 17 years old.
But I kept you, didn't I?

28:38.842 --> 28:40.885
I loved you from the moment you were born,
didn't I?

28:40.969 --> 28:42.679
So get off my jock!

28:42.762 --> 28:44.305
One time, you had croup,

28:44.389 --> 28:46.808
and I sat in the shower all night with you

28:46.891 --> 28:49.227
even though the demolition derby
was in town,

28:49.310 --> 28:52.063
and I gave my ticket to a girl
who got to be on the news

28:52.147 --> 28:53.773
for getting hit by a tire.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.358
That could have been me!

28:55.442 --> 28:58.319
- I don't actually like this!
- Whoo-hoo!

28:58.403 --> 29:00.655
- Whoo!
- Ahh!

29:03.742 --> 29:07.162
- Oh!
- Whoo! Whoo!

29:15.670 --> 29:18.173
You think this is my fault somehow?

29:18.256 --> 29:21.134
You sound like them reporters
and police station ladies

29:21.217 --> 29:24.846
treating me like you got kidnapped
'cause I wore a tube skirt.

29:24.929 --> 29:28.224
- Ahh!
- Whoo-hoo!

29:28.308 --> 29:30.977
Well, what the fudge does that have to do

29:31.060 --> 29:33.104
with the price of meat in Muncie?

29:33.938 --> 29:37.150
A crazy man snatched you
and locked you up.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.443
Oh!

29:38.526 --> 29:41.738
Men keep doing that, every dang day,
every dang way.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.699
When are we gonna talk about that, world?

29:44.783 --> 29:48.411
I don't hurt kids!
And women don't rape things!

29:48.495 --> 29:51.164
Hey, not all men.

29:51.247 --> 29:53.374
I know, Shane.
You've always been a real gentleman.

29:53.458 --> 29:55.043
According to recent CDC numbers,

29:55.126 --> 29:57.837
40% of all sexual assaults
are committed by women.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.757
That seems high.
Keep the bars down 'cause...

30:00.840 --> 30:02.217
We're going again!

30:02.300 --> 30:04.302
You are so full of baloney!

30:04.385 --> 30:06.262
I bet you knew I'd been rescued.

30:06.346 --> 30:07.180
Of course I did!

30:07.263 --> 30:09.390
I just didn't want to have
this conversation.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.601
I wish you were Geena Davis!

30:11.684 --> 30:13.436
Me too, dude!

30:13.520 --> 30:15.605
- Ahh!
- Whoo-hoo!

30:15.688 --> 30:17.524
Whoo!

30:17.607 --> 30:20.735
- Ahh!
- Whoo! Whoo!

30:24.572 --> 30:25.865
Whew.

30:26.866 --> 30:28.576
That coast was epic.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.413
Man, we both got some stuff
off our chests.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.708
I broke my record. Ah.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.085
Yeah!

30:38.419 --> 30:40.004
Look, we're cool, right?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.673
Maybe I wasn't the best mom,

30:41.756 --> 30:46.928
like those penguins who hold their eggs
in their mouths or whatever, but...

30:47.011 --> 30:48.680
I did the best I could, sweetie.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.139
I really did.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.783
I know that should make me feel better.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.867
Ooh!

31:08.950 --> 31:12.036
Ugh! Dang shoe.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.373
Come on, Mom.
I'm too big for Velcro shoes.

31:15.456 --> 31:17.709
Can't teach me how to tie laces,

31:17.792 --> 31:20.003
but you can teach me how to open a beer
with a lighter.

31:22.839 --> 31:24.048
Excuse me, miss.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.219
Can you tell me how to get
to the nursing college?

31:28.303 --> 31:30.096
<i>You did your best?</i>

31:30.179 --> 31:33.057
You couldn't even be bothered
to teach me to tie my shoes,

31:33.141 --> 31:34.309
and my mittens got caught,

31:34.392 --> 31:35.894
and the Howson twins kept walking,

31:35.977 --> 31:37.353
and I was alone!

31:37.437 --> 31:40.064
I got kidnapped because of you!

31:40.148 --> 31:43.276
Is that your best? Unh-unh-unh!

31:43.359 --> 31:44.359
Right.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.616
Kimmy, what are you doing?

31:54.454 --> 31:56.205
I thought I knew why I came down here.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.958
Rays and rails, baby.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.419
But there's nothing I can say

32:01.502 --> 32:02.837
that will un-kidnap me

32:02.921 --> 32:05.298
or fix my childhood

32:05.381 --> 32:07.508
or give you the life you wanted
before you had me.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.802
I could have been Whitesnake's Yoko Ono.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.888
And I just have to accept that.

32:14.390 --> 32:16.100
I just have to accept that.

32:16.184 --> 32:18.561
So like I said, we're cool, right?

32:18.645 --> 32:20.980
Yeah. We're cool.

32:24.275 --> 32:25.735
All right.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.028
Yeah.

32:27.111 --> 32:29.030
Now we're back in touch, who knows?

32:29.113 --> 32:31.115
Maybe I come up and stay with you
sometime.

32:31.199 --> 32:32.408
Sure.

32:32.492 --> 32:34.369
Hey, we just did Thanksgiving.

32:34.452 --> 32:37.121
Put me down for Christmas.
Wouldn't that be fun?

32:37.205 --> 32:40.333
You know, they got some great
old wooden coasters up north.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.793
We could do the Cyclone.

32:41.876 --> 32:42.876
I've done it.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.632
Why do you like roller coasters
so much anyway?

32:49.926 --> 32:53.096
Sometimes you just want to scream
your head off.

32:53.179 --> 32:56.474
A coaster's the only place
no one looks at you weird.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.195
You all right?

33:37.932 --> 33:39.475
Thanks, Mom.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.315
Well, I know what I'm thankful for:

33:46.399 --> 33:48.568
loving someone other than myself...
