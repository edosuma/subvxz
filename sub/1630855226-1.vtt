WEBVTT

00:14.097 --> 00:16.057
I get it with no pulp.

00:16.099 --> 00:17.559
If it has pulp,
I'm gonna send it back.

00:17.642 --> 00:18.560
Okay.

00:18.601 --> 00:20.562
Sarah, your nanny's
here with the triplets.

00:20.645 --> 00:24.441
Oh, yay. Oh, my babies!

00:24.524 --> 00:25.442
Good luck, Mommy.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.278
Oh, sweetie,
I don't need luck.

00:28.319 --> 00:30.155
You're a disgrace
to my people.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.449
I know. Mommy's so bad.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.284
Mommy, when will you be home?

00:34.367 --> 00:35.577
Mommy, when will you be home?

00:35.618 --> 00:38.288
I'll be home when I'm home,
all right?

00:38.371 --> 00:40.582
Colleen, thank you so much.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.541
You're so amazing.

00:41.624 --> 00:44.419
You know, everyone said,
don't get a hot nanny.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.843
Oh, here I go.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.553
Listen to Colleen, okay?

00:53.636 --> 00:55.805
Do whatever she says.
Make sure you brush your teeth.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.432
Your breath smells like shit.

00:57.515 --> 00:58.475
Okay.

00:58.558 --> 01:02.145
People of Earth,
introducing Sarah Silverman!

01:02.228 --> 01:04.689
Sparkle, peanut.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.664
Hi, hello.

01:23.792 --> 01:24.751
Hmm.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.342
Holy shit!

01:32.425 --> 01:33.885
Thanks.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.184
I know, I'm gonna start
with, like, a--

01:41.226 --> 01:43.561
a joke book style joke.

01:45.146 --> 01:49.067
Uh, what did the Jewish mother

01:49.150 --> 01:53.238
say to her porn star daughter

01:53.321 --> 01:56.616
after watching her
in a gangbang?

01:58.993 --> 02:00.745
You were the best one.

02:05.375 --> 02:11.423
You were the best one
of all of them!

02:11.506 --> 02:13.717
That's a great stereotype,
you know.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.719
It's true--Jewish mothers,

02:15.802 --> 02:19.139
they're just so bananas
for their kids.

02:19.222 --> 02:23.226
"My Sharon had
all holes filled."

02:27.439 --> 02:29.816
I've never seen
anything like it.

02:29.899 --> 02:35.196
Anywhere you could put a penis,
there was a penis in my Sharon.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.871
I have a girlfriend who told me

02:42.912 --> 02:46.875
she's switching gears,
career-wise, and is now a--

02:46.958 --> 02:48.543
a life coach?

02:51.755 --> 02:55.800
Look, I'm not saying
all life coaches are crazy,

02:55.884 --> 02:58.345
but I would maybe say that, uh,

02:58.428 --> 03:02.223
crazy people are life coaches.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.516
Is that fair?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.605
She is in absolutely
no position

03:08.688 --> 03:10.982
to give other people
advice at all.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.776
It's so odd.

03:12.859 --> 03:16.112
Maybe it's like the cobbler's
son has no shoes kind of vibe,

03:16.154 --> 03:18.406
but it's bananas.

03:18.448 --> 03:21.034
She can't be alone.
She's a total wreck.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.787
She's like,
"I can't find a boyfriend,

03:23.828 --> 03:27.415
"and there's no single guys,
and half of men are gay,

03:27.457 --> 03:30.001
and I can't tell, and I don't
wanna waste my time."

03:30.085 --> 03:33.254
And I'm like, "I don't know
if that's an exact statistic."

03:33.296 --> 03:37.133
Then she says,
"I just wish that gay men

03:37.175 --> 03:39.969
would wear some kind
of symbol."

03:44.808 --> 03:48.228
And I said, "Um, somebody
thought of that already."

03:50.814 --> 03:52.232
Look, is that the best
joke ever written?

03:52.315 --> 03:55.151
No, I'm not saying it is.

03:55.193 --> 03:58.321
But I do feel like
it's a very fresh take

03:58.363 --> 04:00.990
on a Holocaust joke, you know,
it's--

04:04.327 --> 04:07.330
'Cause during the Holo--
oh, God, I'm sorry.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.917
Uh...

04:11.001 --> 04:13.712
during the alleged Holocaust...

04:16.006 --> 04:21.678
Homosexuals were made
to wear pink triangles,

04:21.761 --> 04:25.640
and Jews had to wear
yellow stars.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.269
Hold on a second--when was
Lucky Charms invented?

04:31.062 --> 04:32.814
This cannot be a coincidence.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.441
There's no way.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.863
I'm not saying that
Lucky Charms are Nazis,

04:39.904 --> 04:44.826
but I would be very interested
in knowing

04:44.868 --> 04:49.414
what side of World War II
General Mills was on.

04:53.752 --> 04:54.919
All right, sure.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.093
Was there an armband involved?

05:02.177 --> 05:07.640
Was he putting Jews
in ovens thinking,

05:07.724 --> 05:10.602
"You know what cereal needs?

05:10.685 --> 05:14.898
"It's gonna sound so crazy,
but marshmallows.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.233
"Not--you're thinking
of the big fluffy ones.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.611
"No, these would be like
the small crunchy ones.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.489
Is that even a thing?
Oh, my God, you guys."

05:24.616 --> 05:25.700
My boyfriend was like,

05:25.742 --> 05:27.994
"You can't say
'putting Jews in ovens.'

05:28.078 --> 05:29.245
"It's, like, too harsh.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.539
It doesn't help the joke,
you know,"

05:31.581 --> 05:34.376
and I was just like, "Okay, so

05:34.417 --> 05:36.753
"you want me
to soften the Holocaust?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.546
"Is that--

05:38.588 --> 05:41.091
"what should I say instead
of 'putting Jews in ovens'?

05:41.132 --> 05:44.761
"Like, 'when he was being,
like, super cunty to Jews,'

05:44.803 --> 05:47.806
does that work better for you?"

05:50.850 --> 05:55.105
I would never buy a German car,
and my parents before me,

05:55.188 --> 05:58.358
they never bought a German car,
because, you know,

05:58.441 --> 06:01.111
we don't wanna give
our money to Nazis.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.113
But, um,

06:03.154 --> 06:05.657
I just bought a German car.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.494
But only because
they're so good, you know?

06:09.577 --> 06:12.288
Plus I feel like
all the original Nazis

06:12.372 --> 06:14.582
are dead, you know.

06:14.624 --> 06:19.504
And sure, there are new Nazis,
but, you know,

06:19.587 --> 06:22.007
they don't know how
to make a car.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.518
Just imagine somebody watching
that, like, "Yes, I do!"

06:33.601 --> 06:36.021
Like, oh, so you're a Nazi?

06:38.189 --> 06:40.567
You know what I feel like?

06:40.650 --> 06:42.944
I feel like I could walk up
to anyone on the street

06:42.986 --> 06:48.867
and be like, "Hi, I don't know
you, this is so weird, but um,

06:48.950 --> 06:54.664
"someone you love who has
passed on wants you to know,

06:54.748 --> 06:57.417
"um, it's not your fault.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.086
Does that make sense for you?"

07:00.170 --> 07:01.838
I don't know.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.594
I just feel like
maybe 100% of people

07:07.677 --> 07:11.306
will know exactly
who I was talking about,

07:11.348 --> 07:14.476
exactly what
I was talking about,

07:14.517 --> 07:18.146
and they would be unburdened,
you know?

07:18.188 --> 07:23.151
I mean, what a mitzvah,
you know.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.653
I mean, I guess you could
get drunk with power,

07:25.695 --> 07:27.489
by, you know, take it all back,
you know, like,

07:27.530 --> 07:30.617
"Oh, there's something else,
wait.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.160
"It's not your fault.

07:32.202 --> 07:36.247
"It's their fault for expecting
too much from you?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.916
Does that resonate?"

07:40.877 --> 07:42.629
My best friend Heidi is gay.

07:42.712 --> 07:45.674
Actually, she just called me,
and she was like, look,

07:45.715 --> 07:48.051
I don't care if you say
that I'm gay.

07:48.093 --> 07:51.054
I don't care if you
call me a lesbian.

07:51.096 --> 07:54.557
But if you're interested
in how I identify,

07:54.599 --> 07:57.394
I identify as queer.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.813
And I was so excited
because, you know,

07:59.896 --> 08:02.065
she's my best friend.
I wanna honor that.

08:02.107 --> 08:08.196
But also because I am from
this area, the Boston area.

08:11.324 --> 08:16.579
And it's just so exciting
to be able to be progressive

08:16.663 --> 08:19.249
whilst saying,
"Hold on a second,

08:19.290 --> 08:20.834
you're fucking queer?"

08:23.962 --> 08:26.381
She's like, "Yes."

08:26.464 --> 08:30.677
So my best friend Heidi
is fucking queer.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.387
She's like,
"I actually don't think

08:32.429 --> 08:34.180
you have to say 'fucking'
before it."

08:34.264 --> 08:36.224
Yes.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.435
I said I'm sorry.

08:38.476 --> 08:41.104
She said,
"It's okay, I love you."

08:41.146 --> 08:43.106
I said, "I love you, too,"
and we hung up,

08:43.189 --> 08:44.774
and my boyfriend was like,
"Who was that?"

08:44.858 --> 08:46.776
I go, "Some fucking queer."

08:50.947 --> 08:54.576
But you know, I don't know if
it's growing up in New England

08:54.617 --> 08:56.661
or growing up in the '80s
or some kind

08:56.745 --> 08:58.204
of combination of both,

08:58.288 --> 09:01.624
but homophobia was so
deeply embedded in us,

09:01.708 --> 09:03.126
we didn't even notice it.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.087
I mean, we played a game
on the playground

09:06.129 --> 09:08.256
called Smear the Queer.

09:08.298 --> 09:09.674
And it was just like nothing.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.134
I mean, even teachers
were like,

09:11.176 --> 09:12.635
"Look, if you're gonna play
Smear the Queer,

09:12.677 --> 09:13.845
"do it on the other wall.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.847
They're taking the PSATs
over here."

09:18.475 --> 09:21.686
Just nothing, just normal.

09:21.770 --> 09:24.814
So Heidi lives in New York,
and whenever I'm in New York,

09:24.856 --> 09:27.192
we hook--you know, we--
not hook up, but we hang out.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.985
We have--

09:29.027 --> 09:31.821
we hang out and

09:31.905 --> 09:34.574
scissor our pussies
together--no.

09:36.618 --> 09:40.372
But we hang out,
and we meet, and--

09:40.455 --> 09:41.456
by the vagina.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.833
No, stop it!

09:43.875 --> 09:45.794
Stop it.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.295
So we meet in Washington.

09:47.337 --> 09:49.631
We met in
Washington Square Park.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.508
And she said, "I don't know
what's going on.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.177
I've had diarrhea
for three straight days."

09:54.219 --> 09:56.012
And I was like...

09:56.096 --> 09:59.099
"Yeah, I don't know." And--

10:04.354 --> 10:05.563
Well, you know,
I'm not a doctor.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.190
So--and we're backpack people,

10:07.273 --> 10:10.360
so she goes, "Go in my backpack
and get my water."

10:10.443 --> 10:13.613
So I go in her backpack,
and I look,

10:13.697 --> 10:18.368
and there is a huge,
mostly-eaten bag of prunes.

10:23.665 --> 10:28.253
I pull it out, I'm like,
"Heidi, I solved the case.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.550
You're, like, mowing prunes."

10:33.633 --> 10:35.051
She takes the bag.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.220
"They're not prunes,
they're dried plums."

10:40.807 --> 10:43.935
I said,
"Let me ask you something.

10:44.019 --> 10:46.646
What do you think prunes are?"

10:47.981 --> 10:50.817
She said,
"Are they dried plums?"

10:50.900 --> 10:52.569
She's a therapist, by the way.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.239
I feel like I need you
to know that.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.407
But look, I get it.

10:57.449 --> 11:01.619
Big Prune was probably like,
"We need to rebrand.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.747
We're the shit fruit."

11:05.874 --> 11:07.000
I get it, it's smart.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.335
I'd love to be
in that pitch meeting.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.502
Pete, what do you got?

11:09.586 --> 11:12.339
Uh, Texas raisins?

11:12.422 --> 11:17.052
Okay, sure, they are like
big, wrinkly raisins.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.512
But raisins is already a thing.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.264
Pamela, what do you have?

11:21.306 --> 11:24.100
Uh, bathtub toes?

11:24.142 --> 11:26.061
Okay.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.898
That's creative,
a bit of a thinker.

11:29.981 --> 11:32.609
But of course,
they went with dried plums.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.027
Good.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.528
They should go
with dried plums, of course.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.988
That's what they are.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.783
But there should be a warning
on the label, you know.

11:39.824 --> 11:43.370
Warning--these are prunes,
though, right?

11:48.124 --> 11:51.294
So we're walking and talking,
as we love to do,

11:51.378 --> 11:54.631
and we kind of park ourselves
across the street

11:54.673 --> 11:57.634
from a Catholic school
that's letting out.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.803
And first of all,
I just wanna say,

11:59.844 --> 12:03.306
I'm so glad there's still
Catholic school.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.643
Because, you know,
they canceled the Boy Scouts.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.436
And then I thought
they were gonna cancel,

12:08.478 --> 12:11.022
like, all the molesty things.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.110
No, they held strong.

12:15.193 --> 12:16.319
Good for them.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.740
I feel bad for the Boy Scouts.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.159
It's so unfair, you know?

12:23.243 --> 12:27.038
All they wanna do is learn
how to, like, tie knots.

12:27.122 --> 12:29.541
And now they can't
because grown-ups

12:29.624 --> 12:31.668
won't stop trying to fuck them.

12:31.710 --> 12:36.047
It's like--
and they're punished.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.298
It's stupid.

12:37.340 --> 12:40.301
I--listen, I'd love
to think of a solution.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.887
I'm spitballing here,
but I'd love to be able

12:42.971 --> 12:45.640
to have the Boy Scouts again.

12:45.724 --> 12:48.018
It's just an idea--

12:48.101 --> 12:51.354
cameras and boys' assholes.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.859
Hear me out.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.193
Hello, Sharks.

12:57.235 --> 12:58.236
No.

13:01.197 --> 13:02.782
You're probably
thinking of, like,

13:02.866 --> 13:06.202
a colonoscopy type situation.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.831
No, this would be facing out,
you know, like a--

13:09.873 --> 13:13.293
like a Ring camera, you know?

13:13.376 --> 13:16.379
And you can send your kid there
and not worry

13:16.421 --> 13:18.923
and just keep an eye out.

13:19.007 --> 13:23.178
If any shenanigans happen--oh!

13:23.219 --> 13:27.432
Get away
from our son's asshole!

13:27.515 --> 13:30.226
Okay. He's gone.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.104
I'm gonna put down
the make-believe phone.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.692
So we're standing
across the street

13:37.734 --> 13:40.236
from a Catholic school
that is letting out.

13:40.278 --> 13:43.198
And it's boys
and girls leaving,

13:43.239 --> 13:46.576
and the girls are all wearing

13:46.659 --> 13:50.663
Catholic schoolgirl uniforms...

13:50.747 --> 13:53.124
like from porn.
I--

13:56.628 --> 13:59.839
I have only ever
seen that in porn.

13:59.923 --> 14:03.593
It was very jarring.

14:03.635 --> 14:07.430
Look, I get it, you know,
Catholic school started it,

14:07.514 --> 14:10.225
but, like, porn finished it.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.686
I--you know?

14:12.769 --> 14:15.105
Maybe it's time
to go another way,

14:15.188 --> 14:19.234
you know, a slack, maybe,
or something.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.945
But they're really
holding strong.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.363
You know,
it's like people who go,

14:23.446 --> 14:26.157
"You know, the swastika
was originally

14:26.241 --> 14:29.536
a Hindu symbol for good luck."

14:29.619 --> 14:31.788
Okay, but, like--

14:31.830 --> 14:34.416
not anymore, right?

14:37.335 --> 14:40.922
Okay, so we're standing
across the street

14:40.964 --> 14:42.799
from a Catholic school
that's letting out,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.300
and the kids are leaving,

14:44.384 --> 14:48.013
and I can no longer contain
myself like I once could,

14:48.096 --> 14:51.391
and I just went,
"There's no hell!"

14:54.310 --> 15:00.400
And one of the kids
was like, "What?"

15:00.483 --> 15:06.156
"I--I'm an adult, and I
promise you, there is not hell.

15:06.197 --> 15:11.619
"It's a const--
it's made up by people

15:11.661 --> 15:14.122
"to manipulate you
through fear.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.832
"It isn't real, I promise.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.085
"And I promise that
knowing there isn't hell,

15:19.169 --> 15:21.671
"you won't suddenly
murder or something.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.173
You'll still be a good person."

15:23.256 --> 15:25.425
And Heidi said, "You can't
tell other people's kids

15:25.508 --> 15:27.802
there's no hell,"
and I was like...

15:27.844 --> 15:30.013
"Did I ruin hell for them?"

15:33.183 --> 15:35.143
But I just can't
bear the thought

15:35.185 --> 15:37.270
of people fearing hell,

15:37.354 --> 15:40.899
moving through their lives
fearing hell.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.984
Hell is so terrifying,
you know.

15:43.026 --> 15:45.695
I went to church growing up
all the time,

15:45.737 --> 15:47.989
because I grew up
in New Hampshire.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.700
And I would sleep over at
friends' houses on Saturday,

15:50.742 --> 15:54.245
and then I would have to go
to church with them on Sunday.

15:54.329 --> 15:57.123
And it was terrifying,
you know.

15:57.207 --> 16:00.210
I mean, the priest was
threatening us with hell.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.796
It was so scary, you know.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.881
The only fun part
was the wafer.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.758
And every time I went to go up,

16:06.841 --> 16:09.010
the mother would go, "Not you!"

16:13.556 --> 16:15.642
I mean, even as a little kid
I was like,

16:15.725 --> 16:17.894
"You know, it's not really
the body of Christ.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.188
You--like, you bought this
at Costco."

16:21.606 --> 16:23.692
What is your fear,
that I'm gonna, like,

16:23.775 --> 16:25.777
put a schmear on it?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.991
But it is really scary, church.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.786
I mean, I'm sure,
hashtag, not all priests.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.122
But it was terrifying.

16:37.205 --> 16:41.251
Like, if you saw
a person screaming

16:41.292 --> 16:44.921
at a kid on the street, telling
them they're gonna, you know,

16:44.963 --> 16:48.133
burn in a fire for eternity,
you'd probably

16:48.216 --> 16:51.219
call, like, Child Services,
you know.

16:51.261 --> 16:55.306
Yeah, there's a man
threatening a child.

16:55.390 --> 16:59.519
What's--oh, he's in all black,
and he's got, like,

16:59.602 --> 17:03.314
a, um, like, a white
embellishment on the collar.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.068
Oh, that's okay?

17:07.110 --> 17:09.195
All right. I'm sorry?

17:09.279 --> 17:10.864
Oh, and they don't
pay taxes, great.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.115
Okay, bye-bye.

17:23.543 --> 17:27.213
I just--I can't bear
the thought of people

17:27.297 --> 17:31.676
making choices from, like,
fearing hell, you know.

17:31.760 --> 17:36.806
I mean, I'm sure this is a
godless crowd, but I mean--

17:38.308 --> 17:40.060
Yeah, sure, I mean,

17:40.143 --> 17:41.936
doesn't make you better
than anyone else,

17:41.978 --> 17:44.230
but yes,
we're mostly godless here.

17:44.314 --> 17:46.232
I'm sure there are
some people that are--

17:46.316 --> 17:49.361
believe in hell and st--
not like, "Who are you?

17:49.444 --> 17:51.071
Raise your hand."
I mean, I--

17:51.154 --> 17:53.281
No, I have God people
in my life, you know.

17:53.323 --> 17:54.824
My sister's a rabbi.

17:54.908 --> 17:59.704
My--I sexted with a "Jeshuit"
priest for three years.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.581
So hot.

18:01.664 --> 18:06.544
My God, and it is "Jeshuit,"
because, like, I said Jesuit,

18:06.628 --> 18:09.047
and then he was, like,
"No, it's 'Jeshuit,'"

18:09.130 --> 18:13.259
And then I was like,
"Is it Je-shus?"

18:13.343 --> 18:16.763
I wasn't sure if it was
a speech impediment.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.474
But no, it's "Jeshuit."

18:22.519 --> 18:24.521
But if you fear hell, I just,

18:24.562 --> 18:26.690
I wish I could release you
from it.

18:26.731 --> 18:32.445
So, um, someone you love
who has passed on...

18:34.197 --> 18:37.158
Wants you to know, no hell.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.911
There's no hell.

18:39.994 --> 18:40.912
How about this?

18:42.455 --> 18:44.582
Oh, thank you, all four of you.

18:46.584 --> 18:49.129
Audiences,
they usually work as one,

18:49.212 --> 18:53.174
but you really made a choice.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.850
How about this?

19:01.933 --> 19:03.226
If there's hell,

19:03.309 --> 19:05.687
may God strike me dead
right now.

19:19.951 --> 19:21.661
See? No God.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.163
I, um--

19:25.123 --> 19:26.750
I don't--
look, maybe there's hell.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.419
I mean, I know I seemed
really positive about it,

19:29.461 --> 19:31.588
but the only way I know--
listen, if the burden of proof

19:31.629 --> 19:35.300
were on me, no, I can't prove
there's no hell.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.344
But I just know
there is no hell

19:37.427 --> 19:40.972
because I believe it
with my whole heart.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.475
And that's science.

19:47.103 --> 19:51.524
You know, but I really do.

19:51.608 --> 19:55.236
It's like anti-choice
protesters, you know,

19:55.278 --> 19:57.489
outside of our
dwindling abortion clinics

19:57.572 --> 20:00.492
with their big posters
of fetuses,

20:00.575 --> 20:04.412
and, you know, they believe
with their whole heart

20:04.496 --> 20:06.289
that abortion is murder.

20:06.331 --> 20:10.919
So that puts me in a pickle,
but I--

20:10.960 --> 20:13.630
I almost feel, like,
a fucked up kinship with them

20:13.713 --> 20:15.340
because I don't like
what they're doing,

20:15.423 --> 20:17.092
but they just
believe something.

20:17.133 --> 20:21.471
Really, it's the disingenuous
politicians that are stripping

20:21.554 --> 20:24.516
our rights away
for no good reason

20:24.599 --> 20:28.144
that I hope go to the hell
I don't believe in, I guess.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.312
But I--

20:36.486 --> 20:40.699
But these people, you know,
they just believe.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.617
And I know what that is.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.744
I know what that feels like
to just believe something

20:44.828 --> 20:48.832
with your whole heart, so much
so that you want other people

20:48.915 --> 20:50.625
to believe it, too, you know.

20:50.667 --> 20:55.338
I just think that if what
you believe is righteous,

20:55.380 --> 20:58.174
you should be able
to convince other people

20:58.216 --> 21:01.428
using just only
what is the truth.

21:01.511 --> 21:06.641
And, uh, fetuses
are not poster-sized.

21:06.725 --> 21:07.726
They're just--

21:09.227 --> 21:10.895
They're only small.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.817
I mean, if fetuses
were poster-sized,

21:15.859 --> 21:18.111
I'd be like, yeah,
that's a life, you know,

21:18.194 --> 21:21.364
but they're not.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.284
They're just teeny-tiny.

21:27.495 --> 21:29.372
I mean, if fetuses
were poster-sized,

21:29.414 --> 21:32.459
those same people would
probably hunt them.

21:40.550 --> 21:43.428
It's conjecture on my part,
and I looked it up,

21:43.511 --> 21:45.055
and that is the right word.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.600
Look, make the poster.

21:48.683 --> 21:52.062
I support you, just make it
actual size, you know?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.022
This is life!

21:55.315 --> 21:57.942
This is life!

21:58.026 --> 21:58.985
This--

22:01.112 --> 22:02.614
That's life.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.034
Oh, buh.

22:09.704 --> 22:11.748
You're just,
you're not changing my mind.

22:11.831 --> 22:16.586
You're just convincing me
and everyone at FedEx Kinko's

22:16.628 --> 22:19.464
that you're, like, super gross.

22:21.174 --> 22:22.258
I don't know.

22:22.300 --> 22:26.221
I just don't buy
that this is about life

22:26.304 --> 22:28.890
or caring for life or--

22:28.932 --> 22:30.433
Thank you.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.606
And I feel so weird
saying this,

22:36.648 --> 22:42.278
but it's gotta be
about hating women or...

22:42.320 --> 22:45.990
maybe fearing women?

22:46.074 --> 22:50.161
You know, because if fetuses
weren't inside our bodies,

22:50.245 --> 22:52.706
they'd be everywhere.

22:52.789 --> 22:55.500
You know, we'd spray for them.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.092
Yeah, all right.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.971
If fetuses weren't
inside our bodies,

23:08.054 --> 23:10.640
it would just be like,
"Yeah, I was talking to Mike

23:10.682 --> 23:13.810
"about doing a block party.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.645
"Maybe everyone could
bring their own--

23:15.729 --> 23:18.982
"I'll bring my famous egg--
oh, gross.

23:19.024 --> 23:20.775
My famous egg salad."

23:23.486 --> 23:24.988
I'm not a good improviser.

23:25.030 --> 23:26.489
I don't know how that--

23:28.783 --> 23:31.036
Where the block party
came from.

23:33.830 --> 23:40.545
I had an existential crisis,
a crisis of existence.

23:40.628 --> 23:43.465
It was--well,
I was watching TV.

23:43.506 --> 23:45.967
Listen, I'm cool,
I watch all the streamers,

23:46.009 --> 23:51.348
but at night,
I watch regular cable TV

23:51.389 --> 23:54.517
because I must fall asleep
to "Law & Order."

23:54.559 --> 24:01.024
And you know, that's on,
like, USA or Ion Television

24:01.066 --> 24:03.318
or MeTV or whatever.

24:03.401 --> 24:06.446
And I just--I don't know
what it is--

24:06.529 --> 24:09.657
I can't fall asleep unless
it's to the dulcet tones

24:09.741 --> 24:11.368
of softcore murder.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.120
But, um--

24:14.204 --> 24:16.706
so I'm watching,

24:16.790 --> 24:18.833
and this commercial comes on.

24:18.875 --> 24:23.546
It's for Cottonelle Extra
Clean, which--

24:25.590 --> 24:26.883
Thank you.

24:32.305 --> 24:35.558
I wipe my pussy with it.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.894
All right.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.398
Well, I do--it is--

24:41.481 --> 24:45.235
as a sidebar to this
existential crisis story,

24:45.276 --> 24:48.780
it is my brand, I will say.

24:48.863 --> 24:51.741
I just--because I like
the ripples, and it really--

24:51.783 --> 24:54.911
it doesn't break apart into
a thousand pieces in my vag--

24:54.953 --> 24:58.581
I'm not trying to make
you all come, but I need--

24:58.623 --> 25:00.917
a strong toilet tissue

25:00.959 --> 25:04.087
for my asshole and vagina,
and--

25:04.170 --> 25:06.923
or vagina and asshole.

25:07.007 --> 25:10.301
It's a front-to-back
correction for the ladies.

25:10.385 --> 25:11.636
Wait.

25:13.638 --> 25:15.598
No, but everyone, not the la--

25:15.640 --> 25:19.144
everyone wipes front to back,
right?

25:19.227 --> 25:21.771
Did you just say no? Oh, yes.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.440
You know why I wasn't
thinking men

25:23.481 --> 25:25.608
is 'cause I, um,

25:25.692 --> 25:27.485
I don't know
where your front starts,

25:27.569 --> 25:29.112
you know, like, I just--

25:29.195 --> 25:32.157
But I'm the worst, though,
like, I'm gonna be hon--

25:32.240 --> 25:38.204
I don't know where my pee comes
out of specifically, you know.

25:38.288 --> 25:41.791
I only know it's
at least three places, but I--

25:41.875 --> 25:44.669
okay, back on track,
the special.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.383
Oh, existential crisis.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.302
So this commercial comes on.

25:52.385 --> 25:55.722
It's for Cottonelle
Extra Clean.

25:55.805 --> 25:59.017
And this is the commercial--
there's a woman standing

25:59.100 --> 26:02.645
in a field with a microphone,
and then there's a row

26:02.687 --> 26:05.148
of outhouses where I guess--

26:05.231 --> 26:07.317
I don't know,
people come from far and wide

26:07.400 --> 26:08.443
to take shits?

26:08.526 --> 26:10.612
And--is the premise.

26:10.653 --> 26:14.324
And as people come out,
she interviews them.

26:14.407 --> 26:20.205
Okay, so a guy comes out,
and she says, "How did it go?"

26:20.288 --> 26:24.459
And he goes, "Good."

26:24.501 --> 26:28.088
And then she goes,
"Do you feel clean?"

26:28.171 --> 26:31.758
And he goes, "Yeah."

26:31.841 --> 26:34.678
And then she says--

26:34.719 --> 26:37.972
by the way, what's this?

26:38.014 --> 26:41.017
There's a microphone
right here.

26:41.101 --> 26:43.895
What's this?
I don't need to do that.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.152
So she says, "How'd it go?"
He says, "Good."

26:51.194 --> 26:53.780
She says, "Do you feel clean?"
He says, "Yes."

26:53.863 --> 26:59.994
And then she says,
"Clean enough to go commando?"

27:00.036 --> 27:04.499
This is when everything
I understood about life

27:04.541 --> 27:07.627
just went kablooey because--

27:13.633 --> 27:17.679
Do we wear underwear

27:17.721 --> 27:21.266
to keep from getting shit
in our pants?

27:25.603 --> 27:28.606
I've never understood life
to be this way.

27:28.690 --> 27:31.985
We're--we're just
ballparking it

27:32.068 --> 27:38.408
and then pulling up
a cotton shit shield.

27:40.785 --> 27:43.288
Keep our chinos clean.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.000
That's fucking disgusting.

27:48.752 --> 27:51.421
I'm sorry,
I do not leave a bathroom

27:51.504 --> 27:55.800
unless I am clean
2 inches deep.

27:59.054 --> 28:01.765
You're supposed to wipe
until it comes back clean.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.558
Are you fucking kidding me? No.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.144
For me, there must be blood.

28:09.814 --> 28:11.941
Just a dot, you know.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.610
It's just like a stoplight.

28:13.651 --> 28:15.320
Red means stop.

28:18.073 --> 28:21.910
Green means go, I guess,
to the hospital, I guess?

28:23.620 --> 28:25.747
Hello? Hello?

28:25.830 --> 28:27.415
I can get pretty low.

28:27.457 --> 28:30.001
When I come home, I'm scared,
and I walk around my house

28:30.085 --> 28:33.713
like this--
Hello, hello.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.508
I look under my bed. Hello!

28:36.591 --> 28:38.968
Look in the closets. Hello!

28:39.052 --> 28:40.720
Hello!

28:42.972 --> 28:44.474
I don't know
what I'm going for.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.601
It's like, it's not just that
I wanna sound like a man.

28:46.643 --> 28:49.187
I wanna sound like
a fucking lunatic.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.816
Hello!

28:52.857 --> 28:54.484
What do I think
is gonna happen, like,

28:54.526 --> 28:56.778
murderers are gonna be like,
"Let's get out of here,

28:56.820 --> 28:59.948
"this guy's crazy!

28:59.989 --> 29:02.534
What is he, a life coach? Oh!"

29:02.617 --> 29:05.453
Oh! Yeah!

29:05.495 --> 29:07.706
It's called the callback, baby.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.417
Oh, my God. What happened?

29:15.380 --> 29:17.007
Jesus Christ.

29:17.048 --> 29:18.508
I know this is impossible,

29:18.550 --> 29:20.427
but it feels like
they switched.

29:25.223 --> 29:26.349
I have a dog.

29:26.391 --> 29:29.102
She's not gonna protect me
if murderers come over.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.729
You know,
she'll just lie on her back

29:30.812 --> 29:33.523
and be like, "Rub my belly."

29:33.565 --> 29:36.234
But I don't know, in that way
I feel like she would

29:36.317 --> 29:38.445
protect me 'cause murderers
would be like,

29:38.528 --> 29:40.488
"Oh, what are we doing?"

29:46.077 --> 29:47.620
Oh, I got
the greatest road gig.

29:47.704 --> 29:49.831
I got to go to Hawaii
to do stand-up.

29:49.873 --> 29:52.083
Like, I got paid
to go to fucking Hawaii.

29:52.167 --> 29:57.839
And thank you, thank you.

29:57.881 --> 30:02.260
So I go--I go to the hotel,
super fancy hotel,

30:02.344 --> 30:03.803
and I go to check in.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.680
Oh, and the lady at the
front desk recognized me,

30:05.722 --> 30:08.558
and she was like,
"Oh, my God, I love you!

30:08.600 --> 30:12.937
You are in my top four
all time favorite comedians."

30:13.021 --> 30:15.732
And I was like,
"You know that I know

30:15.815 --> 30:18.276
that means I'm fourth, right?"

30:20.904 --> 30:23.239
I'm not walking away
from this like,

30:23.281 --> 30:27.577
"Ooh, maybe I'm second,"
you know, no.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.288
There's no top four.

30:32.290 --> 30:34.292
I should've
just said thank you.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.214
So I go put on my bathing suit.
I'm so excited.

30:39.297 --> 30:41.257
I'm gonna go swimming
in the pool,

30:41.341 --> 30:45.887
fancy schmancy hotel pool,
cabanas, the whole thing.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.807
And in the pool area,
there is a sign,

30:48.890 --> 30:51.726
like, a professionally made
sign.

30:51.810 --> 30:56.898
And it says,
"If you have diarrhea

30:56.940 --> 31:02.112
"or have had diarrhea
in the past two weeks,

31:02.195 --> 31:05.281
you are not permitted
in our pool."

31:09.786 --> 31:12.956
I mean, just say it--
no Jews allowed.

31:17.043 --> 31:18.962
That's a micro-aggression.

31:21.339 --> 31:22.590
Right?

31:22.674 --> 31:23.758
Are there any Jews here
tonight?

31:25.135 --> 31:26.928
Whoa, okay, keep it down.

31:26.970 --> 31:31.182
Just do this.
These are precarious times.

31:31.266 --> 31:34.102
I've been so worried
on this tour because I'm in,

31:34.144 --> 31:37.147
like, every town,
and I feel like people--

31:37.230 --> 31:38.857
you know, there might be
someone going,

31:38.940 --> 31:41.943
"I wanna kill all the Jews
in Boston.

31:41.985 --> 31:45.572
But how will we get them all
into one room?"

31:45.655 --> 31:47.991
Hello.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.952
Real Lenny/Squiggy moment.

31:50.994 --> 31:53.163
Who's Jewish, just real close?

31:53.246 --> 31:55.623
You, doll.

31:55.665 --> 31:56.833
What's your name, doll?

31:56.875 --> 31:57.917
Kim.

31:58.001 --> 31:59.836
Kim.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.338
What'd you say?

32:03.715 --> 32:06.051
Oh, Kim Epstein. Aw.

32:06.134 --> 32:09.179
No, don't let him have Epstein.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.769
Think of Juan Epstein. Hey!

32:15.852 --> 32:18.188
Signed, Epstein's mother.

32:18.271 --> 32:20.357
Huh? This is your wife?

32:20.440 --> 32:22.442
All right.

32:22.525 --> 32:23.693
She took your name?

32:25.779 --> 32:26.863
So--
Hyphened.

32:26.946 --> 32:28.198
Oh, what's the hyphen?

32:28.281 --> 32:29.991
Martin.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.369
Huh.
Now I forgot your first name.

32:34.579 --> 32:37.415
Kim Martin-Epstein, hello.

32:37.499 --> 32:43.338
Can I--all right, Kim, may I
ask you a question as a Jew?

32:43.421 --> 32:45.632
Okay.

32:45.715 --> 32:50.679
Have you ever gone 14 days
with zero diarrhea?

32:52.889 --> 32:54.432
That would be absurd, I know.

32:57.894 --> 33:00.063
No, that would be--
that would be, uh...

33:00.105 --> 33:03.983
considered a miracle
in our religion, right?

33:04.067 --> 33:06.778
I mean, what's the big miracle?

33:06.861 --> 33:07.946
Hanukkah.

33:08.029 --> 33:09.906
You know what that miracle is?

33:09.948 --> 33:11.616
A lamp worked.

33:13.576 --> 33:15.286
Longer than expected.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.873
This blows that
out of the water.

33:18.957 --> 33:21.918
We light this candle

33:22.002 --> 33:25.046
to celebrate

33:25.088 --> 33:27.674
Kim Martin-Epstein,

33:27.757 --> 33:34.639
who, despite only having enough
Imodium A-D for two nights...

33:37.475 --> 33:40.937
Lasted 14 nights.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.480
And she was able to swim

33:42.564 --> 33:45.817
at the Four Seasons pool,
praying and--

33:49.529 --> 33:53.783
I don't know why people
hate Jews so much, you know.

33:53.867 --> 33:58.121
I mean, I get a little,
but so much?

33:58.163 --> 34:00.832
There's barely any of us.

34:00.915 --> 34:06.296
I mean, Jews make up, what,
like, 1/5 of 1% of the world.

34:06.379 --> 34:11.384
Like, if you round down,
there are zero of us.

34:11.468 --> 34:16.097
Fucking relax, Jews will not
replace you, Tyler.

34:16.139 --> 34:18.558
We could barely
replace ourselves.

34:18.641 --> 34:22.103
I even asked Siri.
I go, "Hey, Siri." Boop boop.

34:22.145 --> 34:24.773
"How many Jews
are in the world?"

34:24.814 --> 34:27.859
And she said, "Too many."

34:31.196 --> 34:34.491
I was like, Siri!

34:34.532 --> 34:36.701
Disable location.

34:36.785 --> 34:38.411
Just to be safe.

34:41.748 --> 34:42.874
Let's switch gears.

34:42.957 --> 34:44.334
Hitler wrote a book.

34:44.376 --> 34:46.002
Oh, snap!

34:46.044 --> 34:48.129
We stayed on topic.

34:49.756 --> 34:51.675
What's Hitler's book called?

34:51.758 --> 34:53.718
all:
"Mein Kampf."

34:53.802 --> 34:58.264
Some of the non-Jews I feel
like answered that as well.

34:58.348 --> 35:02.227
No, I keep it
on mein nightstand.

35:07.774 --> 35:10.068
What does "mein kampf" mean?

35:10.151 --> 35:11.903
all: My struggle.
My struggle!

35:13.154 --> 35:15.198
Don't yell at me about it.

35:16.533 --> 35:20.245
That's what "mein kampf" means,
my struggle.

35:21.705 --> 35:27.210
That's what Hitler's book
is called, "My Struggle."

35:27.252 --> 35:33.258
That's what "mein kampf" means,
my struggle.

35:33.341 --> 35:38.221
Is there a more
Jewish-sounding book than

35:38.263 --> 35:40.765
-actual Hitler's book?

35:46.062 --> 35:48.148
Should I call this special
"My Struggle"?

35:48.231 --> 35:50.191
Wouldn't that be funny?

35:51.651 --> 35:57.657
I mean, I should call it
"My Struggle."

35:57.741 --> 36:00.577
Honestly, because I feel like
people would believe

36:00.660 --> 36:02.746
that I would take myself
that seriously

36:02.787 --> 36:05.790
to call my comedy special
"Sarah Silverman--

36:05.874 --> 36:07.834
My Struggle."

36:07.917 --> 36:09.711
But also because, like,

36:09.753 --> 36:13.965
when it, you know,
gets translated for Germany...

36:19.346 --> 36:23.350
Some people who would buy it
would be in for, like,

36:23.433 --> 36:25.894
a really big surprise.

36:27.479 --> 36:29.522
I read something about Hitler
I couldn't believe.

36:29.606 --> 36:31.107
I thought I knew everything
there was to know

36:31.191 --> 36:34.986
about Hitler because, you know,
Jews are real Hitler heads.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.323
We wanna know everything.

36:38.406 --> 36:41.326
But I was Wikipedia-ing him,

36:41.409 --> 36:44.788
and--because I had
five minutes.

36:44.871 --> 36:46.456
I never knew this--
maybe you know this.

36:46.498 --> 36:47.999
I never knew this.
This is true.

36:48.083 --> 36:52.545
Hitler, for years,
molested his niece.

36:52.629 --> 36:55.465
Yeah, now he's really canceled.

36:58.885 --> 37:00.970
Can you believe it?

37:03.515 --> 37:04.683
I can.

37:06.601 --> 37:10.063
He's probably like, "I don't
know, I killed 6 million Jews.

37:10.146 --> 37:13.983
What, am I gonna
not molest my niece now?"

37:14.067 --> 37:17.320
Yeah, that was
the right response.

37:17.362 --> 37:20.323
I just feel so--

37:20.365 --> 37:25.120
Like, I do this podcast,
and on it, I'm so--thank you.

37:27.706 --> 37:30.000
But I'm so earnest
on it, you know.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.126
And in the past
couple of years,

37:31.167 --> 37:35.005
I've been so Jewy on it,
you know?

37:35.088 --> 37:37.507
Like, I'm godless.

37:37.549 --> 37:38.925
Well, I'm a godless Jew.

37:39.009 --> 37:40.510
People are like, "How can you
be a godless Jew?"

37:40.552 --> 37:41.511
You can.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.679
That's what's so great
about it.

37:42.721 --> 37:44.681
But I--

37:44.764 --> 37:47.851
I, um, I've just been
so Jewy on it,

37:47.892 --> 37:50.353
and I think because
there's been so much--

37:50.437 --> 37:54.024
such a rise in anti-Semitism,
and it's like--

37:54.107 --> 37:56.860
I don't know, it's like
if you go, "My mom's a bitch,"

37:56.901 --> 37:58.945
and your friend goes, "Yeah,
your mom's a fucking bitch,"

37:59.029 --> 38:01.448
and you're like,
"What'd you say about my mom?"

38:04.367 --> 38:06.661
But then, you know,
my boyfriend goes,

38:06.703 --> 38:08.246
"Yeah, but then
you do stand-up,

38:08.329 --> 38:10.123
"and you're like,
'Jews are gross,

38:10.206 --> 38:11.374
Jews have diarrhea.'"

38:11.458 --> 38:14.836
And I'm like, "Aw."

38:14.878 --> 38:16.046
Try to justify it.

38:16.087 --> 38:17.339
Like, maybe it's like
I'm, like,

38:17.380 --> 38:21.801
taking back the night
kind of vibe.

38:21.885 --> 38:23.386
But no, I'm, um,

38:23.470 --> 38:26.723
selling out my culture
for laughs.

38:28.433 --> 38:29.893
I mean, if you think about it,

38:29.976 --> 38:32.771
what could be more
authentically Jewish?

38:35.732 --> 38:38.026
No, I'm sorry. I can't help it.

38:38.109 --> 38:40.111
It makes me so much money.

38:44.824 --> 38:46.659
Thank you.
Well--

38:46.743 --> 38:49.746
not your problem, this is my...

38:49.788 --> 38:53.958
kampf to deal with
on mein time.

38:58.046 --> 39:04.260
I feel like I have relationship
advice, really, for men.

39:04.302 --> 39:07.222
You know what?
For tops, I would say.

39:07.263 --> 39:09.683
But, um,
how do I get into this?

39:09.766 --> 39:14.020
Like, I have these friends,
they're a couple.

39:14.104 --> 39:15.605
They're a heterosexual couple,

39:15.647 --> 39:18.066
and I'm good friends
with both of them.

39:18.149 --> 39:22.487
But my God, the guy just--

39:22.570 --> 39:25.323
I watch him repeat the same
pattern over and over again

39:25.407 --> 39:29.285
and it drives me insane.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.704
How do I explain it?

39:30.787 --> 39:32.622
There's an example,
like, she cut her arm.

39:32.706 --> 39:34.457
She's like, "Ow, my arm!"

39:34.499 --> 39:37.627
He says, "You're okay."

39:39.629 --> 39:40.964
Has that ever worked?

39:42.298 --> 39:43.883
Ow, my arm!

39:43.967 --> 39:45.510
You're okay.

39:45.593 --> 39:48.013
Oh, my God, you know what?
I am okay.

39:48.096 --> 39:50.724
Thank you. No!

39:50.807 --> 39:53.309
She doesn't feel worried about.

39:53.351 --> 39:56.062
There's no gesture of concern.

39:56.146 --> 39:57.313
Now she has to double down.

39:57.355 --> 39:59.065
It fucking hurts!

40:00.900 --> 40:03.528
Is that what you were
looking for, Kevin?

40:05.363 --> 40:07.657
Was that the reaction
you wanted?

40:07.741 --> 40:10.827
And yet he does it again
and again, he does this.

40:10.910 --> 40:11.828
And I get it.

40:11.911 --> 40:13.747
I know why he says,
"You're okay."

40:13.830 --> 40:18.460
It's because he very much
wants her to be okay, you know.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.920
And also it's probably
partly like,

40:21.004 --> 40:25.967
you know how with toddlers,
like if a toddler falls down,

40:26.009 --> 40:29.721
our reaction is like,
"Oh, uh, um--mm."

40:29.804 --> 40:32.307
You know,
because they look to us

40:32.349 --> 40:33.850
for a cue,
so we've gotta, like,

40:33.892 --> 40:37.437
fucking pull our shit together
and act like they're fine.

40:37.520 --> 40:40.774
I get that, but women

40:40.857 --> 40:44.527
are not toddlers, they're--

40:46.529 --> 40:52.202
They're just like
regular people, you know?

40:52.243 --> 40:56.873
They want to feel like
you are worried or you're--

40:56.956 --> 41:00.001
just like you do, you know,
just some kind of, like--

41:00.043 --> 41:01.961
just triple the worry.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.756
That's all he has to do,
and he'll get--

41:04.839 --> 41:07.384
he doesn't even
have to mean it, you know?

41:07.467 --> 41:08.468
Ow, my arm!

41:08.551 --> 41:10.679
Fuck, babe, are you okay?

41:12.222 --> 41:14.307
Now she feels cared for.

41:14.391 --> 41:16.017
Now she is okay.

41:16.059 --> 41:17.811
Oh, it's all right,
it's just pain.

41:17.894 --> 41:18.645
What's up?

41:18.728 --> 41:20.563
You know, like, it's--

41:20.605 --> 41:22.440
that's what you want.

41:22.524 --> 41:24.484
He never learns.

41:24.567 --> 41:27.737
Although I will say,
my boyfriend has watched me

41:27.821 --> 41:30.365
do this bit a few times now,

41:30.407 --> 41:35.078
and I swear to God, he has
been markedly more attentive.

41:36.746 --> 41:39.416
So I guess my advice would be,

41:39.499 --> 41:42.961
start doing stand-up comedy.

41:43.044 --> 41:47.424
Really hone it
for years, decades even.

41:47.465 --> 41:49.884
Become one
of the all-time greats.

41:51.344 --> 41:52.637
Or--

41:58.768 --> 42:02.272
Or hey, you know,
somewhere in the top four.

42:04.524 --> 42:08.987
And manipulate your loved ones
through observational comedy.

42:11.197 --> 42:14.951
It's so funny how language
is always changing, obviously.

42:14.993 --> 42:17.454
We don't walk around
saying "doth"

42:17.537 --> 42:20.915
or whatever, a good example?

42:20.999 --> 42:22.459
You know, now we
get the pronouns

42:22.542 --> 42:24.127
and everything--good.

42:24.210 --> 42:25.670
It's really not a big deal.

42:25.754 --> 42:27.339
It's so funny to me
when people are like,

42:27.422 --> 42:29.966
"God, with these pronouns!"

42:30.050 --> 42:31.468
You can fight it.

42:31.551 --> 42:33.303
We're all gonna be saying it
like muscle memory

42:33.386 --> 42:34.637
in five years, you know.

42:34.679 --> 42:36.306
But they always fight it.

42:36.389 --> 42:38.725
I'm so excited to call you
they/them

42:38.808 --> 42:43.146
or whatever the fuck, and I
fuck it up 100% of the time.

42:43.188 --> 42:44.773
And I go, "Oh, God!"

42:44.814 --> 42:47.150
And they're always like,
"Yeah, don't worry about it."

42:47.192 --> 42:49.027
They just--just try.

42:49.110 --> 42:51.154
They just want you to try,
that's all, a little effort.

42:51.196 --> 42:53.573
It's like what they say
when you go to France.

42:53.656 --> 42:55.158
You don't just
walk up to someone

42:55.241 --> 42:58.203
and be like,
"Where's the Eiffel Tower?"

42:58.286 --> 42:59.996
You know, it's like, fuck you.

43:00.080 --> 43:02.457
Just, you have to try,
that's all.

43:02.499 --> 43:03.833
You know,
they do all speak English,

43:03.917 --> 43:07.170
but you have to go,
"Uh, parlez-vous--"

43:07.212 --> 43:08.713
oh, don't worry about it.
I speak English.

43:08.797 --> 43:10.799
What do you want? You know.

43:10.882 --> 43:12.425
But I believe in us.

43:12.509 --> 43:16.179
We learned Galifianakis
after just one Hangover movie.

43:16.221 --> 43:17.972
We can do this.

43:19.849 --> 43:23.186
Then there's language
that we've just always known

43:23.228 --> 43:25.730
since we were born,

43:25.814 --> 43:27.816
and we don't think twice
about it.

43:27.899 --> 43:29.734
You know,
we don't question it at all.

43:29.818 --> 43:31.528
I'm talking about balls.

43:31.611 --> 43:32.821
You know, we--

43:32.904 --> 43:35.907
I get it, you know, balls.

43:35.990 --> 43:39.369
She's got balls up there, you
know, a girl pair of balls.

43:39.452 --> 43:41.705
Or, like, oh, he's got balls.

43:41.788 --> 43:43.581
That's what we're using?

43:43.665 --> 43:45.917
Balls? Really?

43:46.001 --> 43:50.046
I mean, to mean guts
or moxie or nerve

43:50.130 --> 43:55.010
or courage or strength,
human balls?

43:55.051 --> 43:57.137
I'm sorry.

43:57.220 --> 44:00.390
Is there anything more fragile
in the whole world?

44:06.938 --> 44:08.898
Even a Faberge egg you could,
like,

44:08.940 --> 44:11.276
kick down a step, you know?

44:14.237 --> 44:17.073
Balls have to be
the exact right temperature.

44:17.157 --> 44:19.284
Like, they're more finicky
than the Moderna vaccine.

44:19.367 --> 44:20.452
You know, they--

44:22.579 --> 44:24.414
Oh, my God,
balls are so fragile.

44:24.456 --> 44:27.167
Like, when you go in the ocean,
your balls are like,

44:27.250 --> 44:28.585
"Ooh, I'm cold!

44:28.668 --> 44:32.589
I've gotta get up close
to the body!"

44:32.672 --> 44:37.427
That's what we're using
for courage, bravery?

44:37.469 --> 44:39.429
Oh, I'm hot,
I've gotta get low.

44:39.471 --> 44:40.930
Lower!

44:41.014 --> 44:43.475
Let me just peek out
your shorts for one second.

44:47.896 --> 44:49.689
I get it, balls is fun.

44:49.773 --> 44:52.317
You know--balls is fun?

44:53.777 --> 44:55.570
That can't be right. No, it is.

44:55.612 --> 45:00.617
Balls--balls the--
the--the phrase.

45:00.700 --> 45:02.327
What is it?

45:02.410 --> 45:05.121
Right, it seems like
it should be balls are fun.

45:07.374 --> 45:09.000
Thank you, lesbian.

45:13.296 --> 45:14.631
No, I get it.

45:14.714 --> 45:16.174
Grammar-wise, I go,
balls is fun to say.

45:16.257 --> 45:18.968
But, like,
"balls" the phrase is fun.

45:19.010 --> 45:21.471
Sorry, my mother
was a grammar Nazi.

45:24.599 --> 45:26.476
The worst kind of Nazi.

45:29.979 --> 45:31.856
But listen,
it doesn't offend me.

45:31.940 --> 45:34.025
Yeah, I say balls.
Yeah, he's got balls.

45:34.109 --> 45:36.236
But you know what I say now,
and it's so much more fun?

45:36.319 --> 45:39.322
Grow a pair of lips.

45:39.364 --> 45:42.158
It's so good.

45:42.242 --> 45:47.539
That guy's got lips to say
that, got fucking lips.

45:47.622 --> 45:48.665
It's fun.

45:48.707 --> 45:52.002
Even my boyfriend says it now,
and he's a toxic male.

45:53.795 --> 45:55.380
But it just
makes more sense too.

45:55.463 --> 45:57.674
I'm not just trying to be
like "the feminist version."

45:57.716 --> 46:00.677
I mean,
vaginas are so resilient.

46:00.760 --> 46:05.015
You know, they push out
entire human beings

46:05.056 --> 46:08.643
and then snap back, like,
maybe 60%, but--

46:08.685 --> 46:10.228
that's hot.

46:12.564 --> 46:15.275
It's just crazy.
Balls are pussies.

46:17.235 --> 46:19.070
Pussies are balls.

46:26.995 --> 46:30.999
You know when you hear about,
like, mindfulness, you know,

46:31.082 --> 46:34.627
mindfulness, ooh, mindfulness.
Be mindful.

46:34.711 --> 46:36.921
I feel like it gets
a real eyeroll.

46:37.005 --> 46:38.923
Yeah, it sounds very, like,

46:39.007 --> 46:41.885
coastal elite
liberal tears-ish.

46:41.926 --> 46:44.888
What the fuck
is happening right now?

46:56.066 --> 46:57.567
Hold on, I'm gonna
piece this together.

46:57.650 --> 46:58.860
I know what happened.

46:58.902 --> 47:00.487
He saw no way out.

47:00.570 --> 47:02.906
He had to pee,

47:02.989 --> 47:06.326
and then
he went over a railing.

47:06.409 --> 47:08.328
And it seems like
he wanted attention,

47:08.411 --> 47:10.330
but he didn't,
because I was like,

47:10.413 --> 47:13.249
we're all looking at him,
and he was just like...

47:18.880 --> 47:20.882
I gave you a tucked ass,
but I--

47:22.258 --> 47:25.428
I have a juicier ass
if I want it.

47:25.470 --> 47:27.430
But I can slip a disk.

47:32.811 --> 47:36.690
Mindfulness, yes,
can be very eye-rolly.

47:36.773 --> 47:39.317
But the truth is,
all it means is, like,

47:39.401 --> 47:43.238
to be aware of something
and then act accordingly.

47:43.321 --> 47:45.323
Mindfulness--
it isn't a big deal.

47:45.407 --> 47:48.410
It's like if you're going
to a party and your friend,

47:48.451 --> 47:50.954
before you went, said, "Listen,
you might see Nancy there.

47:51.037 --> 47:54.791
You should know her son passed
away a couple years ago."

47:54.833 --> 47:56.042
Mindfulness.

47:56.126 --> 47:58.712
Now you not to go up to Nancy
and be like,

47:58.795 --> 48:01.423
"Nancy, how's your alive son?"

48:03.049 --> 48:04.467
It's pretty simple.

48:04.551 --> 48:07.262
You know, it's not a big deal.

48:07.303 --> 48:12.142
Although I--
one time I was, um,

48:12.183 --> 48:15.645
I did a television pilot
with a producer

48:15.729 --> 48:17.063
who's in a wheelchair.

48:17.147 --> 48:19.315
He's been in a wheelchair
his whole life.

48:19.357 --> 48:23.153
And after work one day,
we all went out to eat,

48:23.236 --> 48:25.780
and we're laughing, talking.

48:25.864 --> 48:27.741
People are talking about,
like, you know,

48:27.824 --> 48:29.534
what they're watching on TV,
whatever.

48:29.617 --> 48:32.162
And all of a sudden I get
this idea, and I'm so excited.

48:32.245 --> 48:35.123
And I look at him, and I go,
you know what you would love?

48:35.165 --> 48:38.001
And he said, "What?"
And I said, "Walking."

48:42.172 --> 48:46.593
Yeah, I thought it was funny,
too, you know?

48:46.676 --> 48:50.138
He did not laugh.

48:51.389 --> 48:54.476
My heart, it was--
I felt so bad.

48:54.517 --> 48:57.812
And it was even worse, too,
because when I thought of it,

48:57.854 --> 48:59.856
I got so giddy and excited.

48:59.898 --> 49:01.066
And I was like...

49:01.149 --> 49:04.319
"You know what you'd like?"

49:04.402 --> 49:05.570
Fucking asshole.

49:07.238 --> 49:09.783
In my defense,
I was not made aware

49:09.866 --> 49:12.077
that he could not take a joke.

49:18.750 --> 49:22.253
Oh, I have new, um, porn.

49:22.337 --> 49:25.840
I have a new, like,
porn genre I watch,

49:25.924 --> 49:27.342
different from my last special,

49:27.425 --> 49:30.220
so I thought
I should catch you up.

49:30.303 --> 49:32.722
It's really--
I feel good about it

49:32.764 --> 49:37.102
because it feels like
a victimless crime, you know.

49:37.185 --> 49:42.107
It's basically, like,
very verbally abusive,

49:42.190 --> 49:44.943
verbally dominant men

49:45.026 --> 49:47.362
having sex with pocket pussies.

49:47.445 --> 49:48.405
Now...

49:50.115 --> 49:51.741
What is a pocket pussy?

49:51.783 --> 49:52.909
Some of you may not know.

49:52.992 --> 49:55.245
It's just what it sounds.

49:55.286 --> 50:00.166
It's a disembodied vagina
that you can have sex with.

50:00.250 --> 50:04.754
And, uh, it's k--um--
I guess--and the--

50:04.796 --> 50:07.590
what it is, is, they--

50:07.674 --> 50:10.427
they take the pocket pussy--
it's very niche.

50:10.468 --> 50:12.595
There's only a few
of these videos.

50:12.637 --> 50:17.600
But they seem to, like, wedge
it between their mattress

50:17.642 --> 50:19.561
and their box spring.

50:19.602 --> 50:22.272
And I don't know
if this is part of it,

50:22.355 --> 50:23.982
but there always seems
to be maybe, like,

50:24.065 --> 50:27.152
a pile of laundry
in the background.

50:28.486 --> 50:30.030
And then they have sex with it.

50:30.113 --> 50:32.198
And then the verbal part is,
they're like,

50:32.282 --> 50:34.284
"Yeah, you whore,
you want this,

50:34.325 --> 50:36.119
you slut, you bitch."

50:36.202 --> 50:38.580
And it just does it for me.

50:38.663 --> 50:39.748
I don't know why.

50:41.124 --> 50:43.710
I would not want this
in real life.

50:43.793 --> 50:45.211
Oh, my gosh, look at you.

50:45.295 --> 50:47.964
There is a grown man
like this--

50:48.048 --> 50:49.507
ah!

50:51.468 --> 50:52.552
It's so cute.

50:52.635 --> 50:54.137
Oh, my gosh.

50:54.179 --> 50:57.891
It's also just when they do it,
it does it for me.

50:57.974 --> 50:59.809
But it also--and I know,
they're so, like,

50:59.851 --> 51:02.354
verbally abusive and--

51:02.437 --> 51:05.357
but it's also just very
vulnerable because, you know,

51:05.440 --> 51:08.693
like, there's--there isn't
a person there.

51:11.488 --> 51:15.950
I don't know, look--are men
who film themselves having sex

51:15.992 --> 51:17.702
with a pocket pussy creeps?

51:17.786 --> 51:19.662
Sure, yes.

51:21.498 --> 51:27.295
But what does that make the
nice lady who's watching them?

51:31.299 --> 51:33.218
I'll tell you--a hero.

51:42.352 --> 51:44.521
I just feel like, too,
if I had a penis,

51:44.562 --> 51:47.107
I feel like
I would love a pocket pussy

51:47.190 --> 51:48.441
just from the sound.

51:48.525 --> 51:50.860
Like, it sounds like--

51:50.944 --> 51:52.862
I can't do it.

51:52.904 --> 51:55.657
I didn't know, it's suctiony.

51:55.740 --> 51:57.701
What else is in the news?

51:57.742 --> 51:59.119
All right.

52:01.371 --> 52:07.085
God, my biggest fear,
my all-time number-one fear

52:07.168 --> 52:11.381
is getting dementia
and masturbating in public.

52:11.423 --> 52:13.925
I am...

52:14.009 --> 52:17.220
terrified,

52:17.262 --> 52:19.389
terrified of this.

52:19.472 --> 52:21.766
And it's really ruined
my life because even when

52:21.850 --> 52:26.354
I go to do what's perfectly
natural in my own bedroom,

52:26.396 --> 52:31.568
under my own covers with my
phone, which is masturbate--

52:31.609 --> 52:34.571
to that--

52:34.612 --> 52:37.240
I can't even
come to fruition anymore

52:37.282 --> 52:40.368
without suddenly feeling like,

52:40.410 --> 52:44.539
"Oh, my God, am I doing this
at my grandson's bar mitzvah?"

52:44.581 --> 52:45.707
Like, you know.

52:53.506 --> 52:56.301
Bet you never
thought of that one.

52:57.469 --> 52:59.429
Anyway, now you will.

53:02.223 --> 53:03.683
You know, I was thinking
about this today,

53:03.767 --> 53:10.440
and I have
a very strong moral compass.

53:10.482 --> 53:13.026
I was just thinking
about this today--

53:13.109 --> 53:16.613
very strong moral compass.

53:16.696 --> 53:20.909
And then I realized that
you can't say moral compass

53:20.992 --> 53:23.286
without come and piss.

53:23.370 --> 53:25.372
And I was so excited, you know?

53:27.332 --> 53:32.796
And then I realized that
you can't say moral compass

53:32.879 --> 53:36.925
without oral, come, piss.

53:37.008 --> 53:39.010
And I was so jazzed.

53:40.845 --> 53:45.475
And then I realized that
you can't say moral compass

53:45.517 --> 53:49.187
without mmm, oral, come, piss.

53:49.270 --> 53:50.980
And I was so excited.

53:51.022 --> 53:52.649
I was like, "That's me!"

53:52.732 --> 53:54.984
