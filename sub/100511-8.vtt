00:00.718 --> 00:02.552
Previously on <i>When Calls the Heart...</i>

00:02.577 --> 00:05.029
Virginia Woolf is doing a reading
in Union City tomorrow night.

00:05.054 --> 00:06.093
Would you be my guest?

00:06.118 --> 00:07.498
<i>So, there's a cash flow problem?</i>

00:07.523 --> 00:08.802
No, no. Not at all.

00:08.827 --> 00:09.921
But if there was a problem,

00:09.946 --> 00:11.413
as your partner, I have a right to know.

00:11.438 --> 00:12.968
Minority partner and I'm telling you now

00:12.993 --> 00:14.608
that there isn't a problem.

00:14.911 --> 00:16.720
I guess you heard about
Elizabeth and Lucas.

00:16.745 --> 00:17.908
They're free to do whatever they want.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.171
So, it doesn't bother you then...

00:19.196 --> 00:20.897
Of course not. Why would it bother me?

00:20.922 --> 00:23.912
<i>You know, it's a big step moving
into someone else's home.</i>

00:23.937 --> 00:27.174
Maybe he's put you and
this place on a pedestal.

00:27.199 --> 00:30.934
While we're here I want
to make it our house.

00:31.535 --> 00:34.001
Never mind about Lucas and Nathan.

00:34.026 --> 00:36.412
What do you want to do?

00:43.336 --> 00:46.297
<i>Life is always full of surprises.</i>

00:46.640 --> 00:49.808
<i>It was certainly a surprise when
Lucas invited me to Union City</i>

00:49.833 --> 00:52.136
<i>to hear a reading by Virginia Woolf.</i>

00:53.497 --> 00:55.467
<i>Always the perfect gentleman,</i>

00:55.492 --> 00:58.518
<i>he drove us through the
beautiful countryside.</i>

00:58.743 --> 01:02.021
<i>We went to the theatre
and had a lovely meal.</i>

01:02.301 --> 01:04.900
<i>Talk about a whirlwind weekend.</i>

01:06.280 --> 01:09.320
<i>I could say that this trip
had no impact on Nathan</i>

01:09.790 --> 01:11.824
<i>but I don't think that's true.</i>

01:12.578 --> 01:13.784
Hi.

01:13.809 --> 01:15.786
<i>He's good at hiding his feelings,</i>

01:15.832 --> 01:18.120
<i>but I sense a shift in him.</i>

01:19.357 --> 01:22.301
<i>Any single woman would be
lucky to have either man</i>

01:22.326 --> 01:24.014
<i>as a potential suitor,</i>

01:24.244 --> 01:27.088
<i>and I find myself genuinely torn.</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:31.550
<i>Still, I don't want to
hurt one or the other.</i>

01:32.098 --> 01:36.305
<i>For now, all I can do is be
honest with both of them.</i>

01:50.187 --> 01:51.587
Is everything alright, sweetheart?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.869
No. No, actually, it's not.

01:54.970 --> 01:55.978
What is it?

01:56.003 --> 01:57.208
What's wrong?

01:57.233 --> 01:59.370
Are you feeling alright?

01:59.395 --> 02:00.694
Never better.

02:00.719 --> 02:02.206
What's the matter?

02:02.573 --> 02:04.373
Well, I was thinking about it and,

02:04.398 --> 02:07.378
uh, I still owe you an anniversary trip.

02:08.407 --> 02:09.551
It's hardly a problem.

02:09.577 --> 02:11.351
No, no, a promise is a promise.

02:11.376 --> 02:13.636
Well, you're very busy, I understand.

02:13.661 --> 02:14.926
Yes, I have been busy,

02:14.951 --> 02:18.353
but things have slowed
down so in one month...

02:18.378 --> 02:21.619
- Mmmhmm?
- We are going to Los Angeles!

02:23.657 --> 02:24.989
What?

02:25.014 --> 02:27.469
Lee, we already had
tickets to Los Angeles

02:27.494 --> 02:29.384
and we gave them to Clara and Jesse.

02:29.409 --> 02:31.111
Not this time.

02:32.421 --> 02:34.767
Alright, well, I won't hold my breath.

02:34.792 --> 02:35.830
Hey.

02:36.134 --> 02:37.751
Why on earth would I
think that this time

02:37.776 --> 02:39.392
is going to be any different?

02:39.623 --> 02:43.515
Because this time we have
to be in Los Angeles

02:43.540 --> 02:47.626
to catch our cruise to Santiago, Chile.

02:47.746 --> 02:48.812
Cruise?

02:48.837 --> 02:50.413
At which point we will continue on

02:50.438 --> 02:53.086
around the horn to Rio de Janeiro.

02:53.111 --> 02:55.217
- Rio?
- And finally,

02:55.620 --> 02:57.094
to New York City.

02:57.119 --> 02:58.462
Oh.

02:58.487 --> 03:01.251
Lee Coulter, don't you dare play
with my emotions like this.

03:01.276 --> 03:03.260
Sweetheart, I am so sorry

03:03.285 --> 03:04.963
that none of the other trips worked out.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.148
But this time we're going.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.320
Really?

03:11.345 --> 03:12.478
Really.

03:19.697 --> 03:22.347
Oh... well, don't throw your back out!

03:22.372 --> 03:24.580
We have a trip to go on.

03:26.217 --> 03:28.126
<i>I think we should have a talk.</i>

03:28.567 --> 03:29.584
About?

03:29.660 --> 03:30.767
Our financials.

03:30.917 --> 03:32.947
If there's a problem I would
like to know about it.

03:32.972 --> 03:35.539
Well, if there was a problem
then I would let you know.

03:35.564 --> 03:36.968
Would you?

03:39.218 --> 03:41.347
Why did you take over
the books from Mike?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.354
What is it that you're asking me?

03:43.379 --> 03:44.645
I would like to see the ledger.

03:44.670 --> 03:47.269
I am under no obligation
to show you that.

03:47.475 --> 03:48.631
I'm your partner.

03:48.656 --> 03:51.392
I have the final say over the
operations of this company

03:51.417 --> 03:53.181
and you knew full well
when you invested.

03:53.206 --> 03:54.259
Do I need to remind you

03:54.284 --> 03:56.684
that without my money
none of this would exist?

03:56.830 --> 03:59.041
No bank would touch you
with a ten-foot pole.

03:59.578 --> 04:03.286
I have a right to know our
company's financial situation.

04:04.655 --> 04:06.706
Are you gonna show me the ledger or not?

04:09.935 --> 04:13.420
If there's nothing else I'm very
busy and I have work to do.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.437
<i>Don't forget,</i>

05:04.462 --> 05:07.519
tomorrow is this side
of the classroom's turn

05:07.544 --> 05:08.944
to go on the field trip.

05:08.969 --> 05:10.225
It was fun last week.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.433
Yes, it's a fun way to learn, isn't it?

05:12.458 --> 05:13.791
Now it's our turn.

05:13.978 --> 05:16.272
Now remember, you need to
return your permission slips

05:16.297 --> 05:17.884
or you will be in school tomorrow.

05:17.909 --> 05:20.439
Wait, does that mean the rest
of us have class tomorrow?

05:20.697 --> 05:23.765
Yes. Doctor Shepherd has agreed
to be your substitute teacher.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.236
- Doctor Shepherd?
- Mmmhmm.

05:25.261 --> 05:27.202
Who better than him to
give you a science lesson?

05:27.227 --> 05:29.860
Science? I was kinda hoping
we'd have the day off.

05:29.885 --> 05:34.169
Oh. Well, your hope did not pan out.

05:34.829 --> 05:37.056
Class dismissed.

05:37.081 --> 05:38.392
I hope my mom lets me go.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.237
I'm sure my uncle will let me.

05:40.262 --> 05:43.197
And don't forget to a wear warm
jacket and bring your lunch.

05:43.222 --> 05:44.509
I hope we see a bear.

05:44.814 --> 05:46.613
No, Opal, you do not.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.759
Just a little one?

05:48.009 --> 05:50.562
Where there's a little one there's
bound to be a bigger one.

05:50.587 --> 05:52.697
Besides, bears usually live
up in the higher forest

05:52.722 --> 05:54.772
and we are just going
to the lower woods.

06:00.470 --> 06:01.667
<i>Uncle Nathan.</i>

06:01.692 --> 06:04.001
I need you to sign my permission slip.

06:04.877 --> 06:06.477
We're going on a field trip.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.062
Oh, what kind of field trip?

06:08.087 --> 06:10.121
Into the woods to learn
about the various plants

06:10.146 --> 06:11.480
and trees in the region.

06:11.505 --> 06:13.708
And hopefully see some wild animals.

06:15.278 --> 06:16.622
How far are you going?

06:16.647 --> 06:18.080
Just up to Simon's Pass.

06:18.105 --> 06:20.372
We'll get an early start
and be back before sunset.

06:20.475 --> 06:21.807
That sounds like fun.

06:21.832 --> 06:23.087
Ready to go?

06:23.469 --> 06:24.610
Bye, Mrs. Thornton.

06:24.643 --> 06:26.346
- Bye.
- Bye, girls.

06:28.219 --> 06:29.307
Hi.

06:29.892 --> 06:31.141
Hi.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.239
Hi, Carson.

06:32.264 --> 06:34.274
I hear you're gonna be
our substitute tomorrow.

06:34.299 --> 06:36.392
That's right. It's gonna be fun.

06:36.417 --> 06:37.423
With science?

06:37.448 --> 06:39.505
Yeah, sure. What, you don't think so?

06:39.530 --> 06:41.485
Not as fun as baseball.

06:41.712 --> 06:43.278
We'll see about that.

06:43.614 --> 06:44.948
I'm sorry about that.

06:44.973 --> 06:46.239
That's okay.

06:46.264 --> 06:48.743
Is now a good time to go
over tomorrow's schedule?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.579
Perfect. Let's go inside.

06:58.666 --> 07:00.546
Anything else I can get for ya, Mike?

07:01.346 --> 07:03.129
A tab?

07:03.686 --> 07:05.264
I didn't get paid on Friday.

07:05.289 --> 07:07.261
Henry said he was a little behind.

07:08.460 --> 07:09.625
How far behind?

07:09.684 --> 07:10.973
I don't know.

07:11.593 --> 07:12.975
This has gone on long enough.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.477
I didn't mean to stir up any trouble.

07:14.502 --> 07:15.563
Oh no, you didn't.

07:15.588 --> 07:16.999
I appreciate you telling me.

07:17.181 --> 07:19.231
I'll get that tab started for you.

07:21.191 --> 07:24.404
I am going to need to take a look
at my ledger, if you don't mind...

07:24.563 --> 07:28.324
Thank you for a lovely weekend.

07:31.875 --> 07:34.248
These look delicious. But not necessary.

07:34.367 --> 07:38.668
Lucas, you paid for the tickets,
the dinner, and the hotel rooms.

07:38.772 --> 07:41.336
The very least I can do
is bake you some cookies.

07:41.954 --> 07:43.020
Thank you.

07:43.056 --> 07:44.188
You're welcome.

07:44.309 --> 07:47.509
I actually have something for you, too.

07:47.830 --> 07:49.197
Lucas!

07:58.478 --> 08:00.856
You got Virginia Woolf's autograph?

08:01.741 --> 08:02.941
Oh...

08:05.289 --> 08:06.778
Is this what took you so long

08:06.803 --> 08:08.670
when you were getting
snacks at the reading?

08:08.695 --> 08:10.420
Guilty.

08:10.592 --> 08:12.389
I actually wanted to
give it to you yesterday

08:12.414 --> 08:15.412
but I thought it should be bound
in something more special.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.290
Thus, the leather cover.

08:19.924 --> 08:21.585
It's very beautiful.

08:21.953 --> 08:23.352
Thank you.

08:26.730 --> 08:28.748
Well, I guess I should be going.

08:28.773 --> 08:30.428
I have a busy day tomorrow.

08:30.453 --> 08:31.638
School?

08:31.663 --> 08:33.982
Actually, we're taking a
field trip into the woods.

08:34.008 --> 08:35.053
Have a wonderful time.

08:35.078 --> 08:36.475
Thank you.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.477
And thank you.

08:45.203 --> 08:47.236
Okay, keep them closed.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.895
Can I open them yet?

08:48.920 --> 08:50.866
No, no. No, no, no.

08:50.891 --> 08:52.325
Okay.

08:52.541 --> 08:53.660
Now.

09:03.902 --> 09:05.254
What's the occasion?

09:05.339 --> 09:06.872
Do I need one?

09:06.923 --> 09:09.716
I'm still trying to get a hang
of this whole marriage thing.

09:09.805 --> 09:12.637
Oh. No occasion needed.

09:13.022 --> 09:14.120
Thank you.

09:14.145 --> 09:16.456
Mmmhmm. Oh, it gets even better.

09:16.481 --> 09:17.915
Hold on.

09:20.623 --> 09:24.023
Oh, my favourite! Grilled cheese.

09:24.286 --> 09:25.686
Allow me.

09:31.377 --> 09:33.045
Champagne for the lady?

09:33.070 --> 09:34.793
Yes, please.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.117
How was your day?

09:36.246 --> 09:37.829
It was good. Busy.

09:37.854 --> 09:40.665
But this makes up for everything.

09:47.238 --> 09:48.761
A toast.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.906
To married life.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.620
To married life.

09:58.914 --> 10:00.247
Mmm.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.269
Are you hungry?

10:02.452 --> 10:03.984
Yes, please.

10:04.116 --> 10:06.261
Oh, did I tell you, Lee's
gonna let me manage

10:06.286 --> 10:07.589
my own timber block?

10:07.614 --> 10:08.652
Oh, really?

10:08.677 --> 10:10.456
Yeah. I'm going timber
cruising tomorrow.

10:10.481 --> 10:12.199
Uh, timber what?

10:12.888 --> 10:15.782
It's where you uh, survey
and measure the timber.

10:17.942 --> 10:19.911
That's great, sweetie.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.980
There's one downside.

10:23.005 --> 10:24.207
Oh.

10:24.433 --> 10:26.486
I have to wake up at 5:00am.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.422
I know, I'm sorry. I'll try to be quiet.

10:29.788 --> 10:31.758
No, it's okay.

10:31.883 --> 10:35.650
I'll get up early and
make you some breakfast

10:35.675 --> 10:37.241
and pack you a lunch.

10:37.266 --> 10:38.410
You don't have to do that.

10:38.435 --> 10:42.144
I like doing nice things for my husband.

10:50.889 --> 10:53.070
<i>Look. That one instead?</i>

10:53.263 --> 10:55.072
And what about this one?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.696
Yeah?

10:56.832 --> 10:59.884
Looks like he's gonna be a
builder just like his daddy was.

11:00.569 --> 11:02.436
He's definitely getting
the hang of this.

11:02.461 --> 11:05.493
We will be gone all day so if
there's any emergency just-

11:05.518 --> 11:06.947
I'll go to Mrs. Coulter.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.690
Thank you.

11:08.715 --> 11:10.019
Be a good boy for Laura.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.611
We should be home by 5:00.

11:11.636 --> 11:12.877
Bye, Jack.

11:12.902 --> 11:14.591
Bye.

11:16.239 --> 11:17.297
Uh-oh.

11:17.322 --> 11:18.522
Uh-oh.

11:20.083 --> 11:21.264
Woah!

11:21.289 --> 11:22.550
Woah!

11:22.727 --> 11:26.520
Oh, boy. That's a good boy.
Thank you for the kisses.

11:26.545 --> 11:27.938
Yes, thank you.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.898
Oh, nice dog.

11:30.364 --> 11:31.566
Oh.

11:31.591 --> 11:32.754
- Good morning.
- Hi.

11:32.779 --> 11:36.003
After you left I remembered that
I have a pair of binoculars

11:36.089 --> 11:38.066
and I thought you might
like to take them with you

11:38.091 --> 11:39.449
on your outing.

11:39.703 --> 11:41.230
Lucas.

11:41.603 --> 11:42.759
Thank you.

11:42.784 --> 11:44.788
The children will love these.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.777
<i>Wow, you can really see so far.</i>

11:56.531 --> 11:57.635
Thank you.

11:57.660 --> 11:58.817
You're welcome.

11:58.951 --> 12:00.221
Bye.

12:11.010 --> 12:13.527
You know, Mr. Bouchard
lent us some binoculars.

12:13.552 --> 12:14.614
Would you like to try them?

12:14.639 --> 12:16.139
- Sure.
- I would.

12:16.596 --> 12:18.232
Boys, don't go too far!

12:18.257 --> 12:20.942
I promised your parents
I'd get you home safely.

12:21.254 --> 12:23.076
Alright, here you are.

12:24.963 --> 12:26.621
Wow.

12:30.244 --> 12:31.977
You can see all the
way up to the forest.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.171
Mmmhmm.

12:35.948 --> 12:38.009
I found an arrowhead!

12:38.302 --> 12:40.496
Oh, my goodness.

12:43.035 --> 12:45.535
<i>- An arrowhead!
- Wow.</i>

12:45.560 --> 12:47.392
Oh, wow, Emily.

12:47.754 --> 12:48.948
Isn't it beautiful?

12:48.973 --> 12:50.192
<i>It's lovely.</i>

12:50.217 --> 12:53.883
You know, many consider an
arrowhead to be a work of art.

12:53.908 --> 12:55.140
I can see why.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.621
How did they make it?

12:56.646 --> 12:59.556
Well, they would take a
hard stone like flint

12:59.581 --> 13:01.310
and with another stone
they would strike it

13:01.335 --> 13:03.047
over and over and over again

13:03.072 --> 13:05.410
until it got much thinner and smaller

13:05.494 --> 13:07.329
and in the shape of an...

13:07.652 --> 13:08.728
Arrow.

13:08.753 --> 13:09.989
Yes.

13:10.574 --> 13:11.640
How old is it?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.190
There's no way to know for sure.

13:13.215 --> 13:16.129
It could be a hundred
years old, maybe more.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.512
Wow.

13:17.626 --> 13:19.874
You found real buried treasure.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.207
You're so lucky.

13:21.232 --> 13:24.127
Maybe you should have Mrs. Thornton
hold onto it for you.

13:24.152 --> 13:25.555
I can take care of it.

13:26.601 --> 13:28.934
Alright, everyone. Let's keep going.

13:32.431 --> 13:33.774
<i>Good morning.</i>

13:33.799 --> 13:35.990
<i>Good morning, Doctor Shepherd.</i>

13:36.015 --> 13:38.421
The first thing I want
you to do is draw me

13:38.446 --> 13:41.447
a picture of a heart real
fast and hold it up.

13:50.515 --> 13:55.092
Okay, those are all very nice
representations of our hearts.

13:55.338 --> 13:59.091
And they're also all very... wrong.

13:59.555 --> 14:03.636
This is what a real heart looks like.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.775
Now, I'm sure Mrs. Thornton
has told you that the heart

14:06.800 --> 14:10.892
is an organ but did you know
that it's made from muscle?

14:10.936 --> 14:12.170
Let me see your muscles.

14:12.195 --> 14:14.062
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:14.121 --> 14:17.557
And it's also one of the most
important organs that we have.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.507
It's located right here,
on the left side,

14:20.532 --> 14:22.506
<i>just behind the breast bone.</i>

14:22.531 --> 14:24.740
Also known as the sternum.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.535
Any questions?

14:27.929 --> 14:29.411
Yes, Timmy.

14:29.575 --> 14:32.665
You said this was gonna
be as fun as baseball.

14:33.011 --> 14:35.733
Right. Well, it's still early.

14:36.449 --> 14:37.882
Give me time.

14:37.907 --> 14:39.273
You're gonna like this.

14:39.298 --> 14:42.275
The heart has four chambers.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.570
<i>The left and right atrium</i>

14:43.595 --> 14:45.720
<i>and the left and the right ventricle.</i>

14:49.653 --> 14:51.892
You think we'd at least see a beaver.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.365
- What's wrong?
- There's a wolf!

14:57.390 --> 14:59.100
- You saw one?
- In the woods!

14:59.125 --> 15:00.373
Over there!

15:00.878 --> 15:02.677
Let me see those binoculars.

15:14.599 --> 15:16.553
Robert.

15:16.578 --> 15:19.326
You should have seen the
looks on your faces!

15:19.811 --> 15:22.046
It isn't funny to scare people.

15:22.071 --> 15:23.737
You should really apologize.

15:23.762 --> 15:24.861
You're right.

15:24.886 --> 15:25.920
I'm sorry.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.692
Maybe it's for the best we haven't seen

15:27.717 --> 15:29.351
any real wild animals?

15:30.618 --> 15:31.952
Let's go.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.214
What're you doing?

15:42.239 --> 15:45.321
Hey, Nathan. Just uh,
switching out a bulb.

15:45.346 --> 15:47.197
Tail light burned out.

15:47.384 --> 15:49.157
You know a lot about cars?

15:49.480 --> 15:51.547
Don't let this fool ya.

15:51.631 --> 15:55.253
No, this is about the extent
of my automotive prowess.

15:55.312 --> 15:58.125
Any more than this and I
gotta take it to a mechanic.

15:58.960 --> 16:03.004
How uh... how did you
learn how to drive?

16:03.758 --> 16:08.160
Uh, well, um... my father
was a travelling salesman

16:08.185 --> 16:10.589
and he had this little runabout.

16:10.614 --> 16:12.734
Back then the steering
wheel was a stick.

16:12.759 --> 16:14.893
Now that was a fun car to drive.

16:14.936 --> 16:18.683
I guess that was the beginning
of my fascination with cars.

16:19.137 --> 16:23.306
Is it um... is it hard
to learn how to drive?

16:23.339 --> 16:24.433
No.

16:24.459 --> 16:26.520
No, not at all. Why, are
you thinking about it?

16:26.545 --> 16:27.941
Oh, I-I don't know.

16:27.966 --> 16:30.292
It's not like I have much use for it.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.118
You never know.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.221
I guess you never know.

16:34.246 --> 16:36.478
I'd be more than happy to
teach you if you want.

16:36.503 --> 16:38.191
- Really?
- Absolutely.

16:38.216 --> 16:40.582
Sorry to interrupt,

16:40.607 --> 16:43.408
but I thought you should know
Jesse hasn't checked in yet.

16:43.519 --> 16:45.379
Really? He should have
checked in an hour ago.

16:45.404 --> 16:46.651
Yeah. And I hear the winds

16:46.676 --> 16:48.394
are starting to pick up on the mountain.

16:48.419 --> 16:50.427
More than likely he just hunkered down.

16:50.480 --> 16:51.995
<i>Or he lost track of time.</i>

16:52.020 --> 16:53.994
All the same, I was thinking
I'd go look for him.

16:54.019 --> 16:55.387
No, no. I'll take the car.

16:55.412 --> 16:57.247
You, you go to the office,
wait by the phone

16:57.272 --> 16:59.534
in case they call from the mill.
Thanks, Kurt.

16:59.559 --> 17:01.605
What's all this about the wind?

17:02.011 --> 17:04.440
Well, the winds can be pretty
dangerous up on that mountain.

17:04.464 --> 17:06.098
Elizabeth's up there with the kids.

17:06.165 --> 17:07.660
<i>She's doing a field trip.</i>

17:07.701 --> 17:09.135
I better go make sure they're okay.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.558
Okay. Alright.

17:16.810 --> 17:19.664
Giddy up, let's go!

17:27.815 --> 17:29.815
Alright, we are gonna
our heart rates up.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.684
<i>Let's start with squats.</i>

17:31.709 --> 17:32.918
Follow me.

17:32.943 --> 17:33.961
One.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.208
Two.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.767
Four. Keep going.

17:38.922 --> 17:40.518
<i>A little faster.</i>

17:40.951 --> 17:42.435
<i>Good, that's right.</i>

17:42.460 --> 17:44.059
Now running in place.

17:46.142 --> 17:47.808
<i>Pump your arms.</i>

17:47.883 --> 17:49.262
<i>High knees.</i>

17:49.287 --> 17:50.381
Yeah, yeah.

17:50.406 --> 17:52.300
What's next? Star jumps.

17:53.992 --> 17:55.534
<i>A little faster.</i>

17:55.836 --> 17:58.704
<i>And stop.</i>

17:59.056 --> 18:00.890
Alright, put your hand on your neck.

18:01.120 --> 18:02.458
And now when I say "start"

18:02.483 --> 18:03.801
I want you to do the math

18:03.826 --> 18:05.219
and figure out your heart rate.

18:05.244 --> 18:07.129
Now it's science and math?

18:09.082 --> 18:11.799
How would you like to
listen for your heart beat

18:11.824 --> 18:12.980
instead of your heart rate?

18:13.005 --> 18:14.404
How?

18:16.379 --> 18:17.553
With this.

18:17.578 --> 18:18.974
Sure.

18:19.484 --> 18:21.332
Put these in your ears,

18:21.683 --> 18:24.718
bring this right up to your
heart on the left side.

18:26.382 --> 18:27.690
Do you hear that?

18:28.064 --> 18:29.330
Yeah?

18:29.355 --> 18:30.818
Okay.

18:31.173 --> 18:36.616
Alright, begin counting... now.

18:45.197 --> 18:46.563
That's a fern.

18:46.588 --> 18:49.128
That's one of the oldest species
of plants in the woods.

18:49.211 --> 18:52.216
Mrs. Thornton, look at this
beautiful flower I found.

18:52.241 --> 18:54.510
- What kind is it?
- That's called a cone flower.

18:54.535 --> 18:56.961
And if you dry out the petals
you can make a wonderful tea.

18:56.986 --> 18:58.018
- Really?
- Mmmhmm.

18:58.043 --> 18:59.931
I better go get some more.

19:12.473 --> 19:15.196
Robert, would you please
help me with the blanket?

19:15.341 --> 19:17.033
Children, it's time to get going.

19:17.058 --> 19:18.820
Aww, already?

19:18.845 --> 19:20.577
Well, the wind is picking up.

19:20.602 --> 19:22.288
It's not that bad.

19:22.442 --> 19:25.498
Still, better safe than sorry.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.218
Clara, did you order these?

19:40.293 --> 19:42.861
Oh, yes.

19:42.886 --> 19:46.019
Mrs. Anderson asked me to sew
some baby clothes for her.

19:46.056 --> 19:47.756
This one's sweet.

19:47.824 --> 19:49.190
Oh.

19:49.327 --> 19:51.774
I wanted to practise
making little dresses.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.171
Oh.

19:53.196 --> 19:55.612
I mean, I don't know when
it's going to happen

19:55.786 --> 19:58.406
but I hope it does.

19:59.351 --> 20:02.118
You and Jesse will make
wonderful parents someday.

20:02.440 --> 20:03.786
Thank you.

20:05.883 --> 20:08.750
You don't think that I'm
jinxing myself, do you?

20:09.340 --> 20:11.373
Uh, no. Of course not.

20:11.635 --> 20:14.590
One can never be too
prepared for motherhood.

20:25.855 --> 20:26.884
Lucas.

20:26.909 --> 20:27.947
Judge.

20:27.972 --> 20:30.271
Oh, this sounds like an official visit.

20:30.341 --> 20:31.774
I need your help.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.266
What's the problem?

20:33.429 --> 20:36.430
Henry is refusing to show
me our accounting books.

20:36.455 --> 20:38.369
Now, it's one thing for
my money to be held up

20:38.394 --> 20:40.594
but I hear he's late
paying our employees.

20:40.619 --> 20:42.424
You think there's foul play?

20:42.647 --> 20:45.703
I don't know, but that's
what I want to find out.

20:46.009 --> 20:48.009
Well, you'll have to file a complaint,

20:48.142 --> 20:50.729
then I'll have to determine if
you're entitled to see the books.

20:50.754 --> 20:51.892
I am.

20:52.636 --> 20:54.650
Here's our partnership agreement.

20:58.322 --> 21:00.164
Well, you'll still have
to file your complaint.

21:00.189 --> 21:01.720
I'll read this over and if you're right

21:01.745 --> 21:03.378
I'll have your subpoena.

21:03.707 --> 21:04.932
Thank you.

21:11.406 --> 21:15.358
What happens if Henry still
doesn't want to turn them over?

21:15.676 --> 21:17.458
Well, then I'd hold him in contempt

21:17.483 --> 21:19.525
which would mean jail time for him.

21:20.379 --> 21:22.616
Does it have to go that far?

21:22.741 --> 21:24.775
Once you start the wheels
of justice turning

21:24.809 --> 21:26.828
it's out of your hands and into mine.

21:44.227 --> 21:45.429
Alright, everyone.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.558
It's too dangerous to head home now.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.858
We'll have to find a place
where we can wait things out.

21:49.883 --> 21:51.448
Now, I know where to go

21:51.473 --> 21:53.102
but I need all of you to hold hands

21:53.127 --> 21:55.664
and whatever you do, do not let go.

21:58.780 --> 22:00.381
You're going to be alright.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.573
I won't let anything happen to you.

22:03.254 --> 22:04.854
Everyone grab hands.

22:04.952 --> 22:06.325
Let's go.

22:16.690 --> 22:18.727
Oh, I'll be with you in
just a minute, Florence.

22:18.752 --> 22:20.673
Oh, I'm not here to shop.

22:20.862 --> 22:23.761
I wanted to see if you
heard any more on Jesse.

22:24.048 --> 22:25.470
What about Jesse?

22:25.648 --> 22:27.306
No one told you?

22:27.567 --> 22:29.016
No.

22:29.362 --> 22:30.528
What's going on?

22:30.586 --> 22:32.810
Jesse didn't check in
when he was supposed to,

22:32.911 --> 22:35.311
<i>so, Lee drove up to the
mountain to try and find him</i>

22:35.336 --> 22:38.225
<i>but that was some time ago now.</i>

22:39.739 --> 22:42.628
Lee would have called me if
there was anything wrong.

22:42.653 --> 22:43.852
Where did you hear this?

22:43.877 --> 22:46.033
I heard Lee and Nathan talking.

22:46.409 --> 22:48.014
I should get back to the switchboard.

22:48.039 --> 22:50.042
If I hear anything I'll
let you know right away.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.232
Mmmhmm.

22:53.251 --> 22:56.285
I'm sure Jesse just got busy
and lost track of time.

22:56.310 --> 22:57.331
It's a big mountain.

22:57.356 --> 23:00.463
Why, they're probably
already on their way home.

23:04.991 --> 23:06.891
Thanks everyone.

23:07.270 --> 23:09.055
Hope you learned something today.

23:09.340 --> 23:10.973
<i>Bye.</i>

23:11.215 --> 23:14.436
Mrs. Thornton will be
back tomorrow, so...

23:15.869 --> 23:18.273
<i>Bundle up, it's starting to get windy.</i>

23:19.702 --> 23:20.983
Here you go, Timmy.

23:21.048 --> 23:22.346
Thanks.

23:24.633 --> 23:25.966
Doctor Shepherd?

23:26.065 --> 23:29.617
It wasn't quite baseball but it was fun.

23:38.205 --> 23:39.545
Hello?

23:40.207 --> 23:42.421
Any word from them?

23:43.524 --> 23:45.258
Do we know the conditions up there?

23:45.645 --> 23:48.269
Okay. Let me know if you hear anything.

23:48.871 --> 23:50.285
What is it?

23:50.310 --> 23:51.379
No word yet.

23:51.404 --> 23:53.003
What about the conditions?

23:53.028 --> 23:54.144
It's windy.

23:54.169 --> 23:55.811
How bad, Kurt?

23:56.314 --> 23:58.105
Kurt, answer her, please.

23:58.149 --> 24:00.731
I'm told it's bad and getting worse.

24:01.127 --> 24:03.227
But I really don't think
there's any reason to worry.

24:03.252 --> 24:05.136
<i>I'm sure Lee and Jesse are
just holed up somewhere</i>

24:05.161 --> 24:07.239
<i>waiting out the winds.</i>

24:10.174 --> 24:11.993
It's over there!

24:15.141 --> 24:16.425
What're you doing?

24:16.450 --> 24:17.915
I forgot my arrowhead.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.104
It's not important.

24:19.129 --> 24:20.793
It is. I'll be right back.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.700
Emily!

24:24.868 --> 24:27.058
- Mrs. Thornton!
- Allie, what is it?

24:27.091 --> 24:28.625
It's Emily. She let go.

24:28.650 --> 24:30.983
She went back to get her arrowhead.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.497
Let's get all of you
into the hunting cabin

24:35.522 --> 24:37.081
and then I'll go after her.

24:37.106 --> 24:39.072
Come on. Inside.

24:39.097 --> 24:40.230
Let's go.

24:40.255 --> 24:41.648
<i>Elizabeth!</i>

24:44.136 --> 24:45.335
<i>Is everyone alright?</i>

24:45.395 --> 24:47.289
No. Emily ran off for something.

24:47.314 --> 24:48.380
I have to go back for her.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.034
No, you stay with the kids in the cabin.

24:50.059 --> 24:51.059
I'll get Emily.

24:51.084 --> 24:52.909
She probably went to the
clearing for her basket.

24:52.934 --> 24:54.237
She found an arrowhead.

24:54.262 --> 24:56.323
Okay. Here. Take Newton.

24:56.348 --> 24:58.214
This wind will spook him.

25:03.064 --> 25:04.099
<i>Henry.</i>

25:04.132 --> 25:05.181
Lucas, I'm busy.

25:05.214 --> 25:07.558
So am I, so let's get right to it.

25:08.065 --> 25:09.800
If you don't produce the books

25:09.825 --> 25:11.637
I'm going to get them
with a court order.

25:11.815 --> 25:13.854
You're going to file
an action against me?

25:14.109 --> 25:16.674
I've spoken to Bill, I
filled out the paperwork.

25:16.699 --> 25:18.058
It's just a matter of filing it.

25:18.083 --> 25:19.478
You know you'd be crossing the line

25:19.503 --> 25:21.001
that could not be uncrossed.

25:21.026 --> 25:22.941
Then don't force my hand.

25:23.419 --> 25:25.753
<i>Just hand over Gowen Petroleum's books.</i>

25:25.812 --> 25:27.253
Why don't you trust me?

25:27.278 --> 25:29.111
Why don't you trust me?

25:31.565 --> 25:34.159
You have 24 hours to
produce the ledgers.

25:35.392 --> 25:36.691
Or?

25:36.716 --> 25:39.372
Or be ready to be held in contempt.

25:39.557 --> 25:42.375
It appears as if that's
already happened.

25:50.238 --> 25:52.204
I'm worried about Emily.

25:52.405 --> 25:54.238
Your uncle will find her.

25:54.494 --> 25:55.929
How could you just let her go?

25:55.954 --> 25:57.393
I didn't.

25:57.418 --> 25:59.458
Robert, it's not her fault.

25:59.871 --> 26:01.118
I'm scared.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.143
Oh, Opal. I know.

26:03.203 --> 26:05.888
But listen, we are okay in here.

26:05.913 --> 26:07.524
Are you sure?

26:07.832 --> 26:10.009
Well, we're safer in here
than we are out there.

26:10.034 --> 26:11.821
What about Uncle Nathan?

26:12.279 --> 26:15.533
He'll be back soon with Emily.

26:15.662 --> 26:18.077
They will both be alright.

26:38.071 --> 26:39.586
Nathan's gone.

26:39.611 --> 26:41.160
I need your help.

26:41.185 --> 26:42.329
What is it?

26:42.354 --> 26:44.140
Jesse didn't check in
after doing some work

26:44.165 --> 26:45.173
up on the mountain.

26:45.198 --> 26:47.360
Lee went looking for him and
he hasn't come back yet.

26:47.385 --> 26:48.917
There could be a good explanation.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.962
I just spoke with Kurt. He's worried.

26:50.987 --> 26:52.863
Okay.

26:54.630 --> 26:57.042
This is the area that
Jesse was working in.

26:57.413 --> 26:59.662
There are a lot of trails up there.

27:00.149 --> 27:01.520
I'll assemble a search party.

27:01.545 --> 27:03.262
I think Kurt and some of
the other millworkers

27:03.287 --> 27:04.620
would be willing to help out.

27:04.645 --> 27:05.727
How's Clara?

27:05.752 --> 27:07.748
She'll be a lot better
once you find her husband.

27:07.773 --> 27:10.016
Of course. We'll head
up there right away.

27:10.115 --> 27:11.515
Thank you, Bill.

27:13.919 --> 27:15.619
We'll find them.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.305
<i>Emily!</i>

27:24.845 --> 27:26.312
Emily!

27:30.400 --> 27:31.891
Emily!

27:56.253 --> 27:58.091
Clara, what are you doing?

27:58.116 --> 27:59.720
I'm going to go look for Jesse.

28:00.885 --> 28:02.571
Bill has a search party.

28:02.596 --> 28:03.806
They're already headed up there.

28:03.831 --> 28:05.805
It's a big mountain. They're
going to need help.

28:05.830 --> 28:08.429
- Clara.
- I can't just stay here and do nothing.

28:08.454 --> 28:09.520
He's my husband.

28:09.693 --> 28:11.267
The wind isn't bad here

28:11.292 --> 28:13.101
but it can be much worse
up on the mountain.

28:13.126 --> 28:16.070
Which is exactly why I have
to go out and find him.

28:17.111 --> 28:20.074
Alright. Move over. I'm going to drive.

28:26.876 --> 28:28.291
Here we go.

28:32.675 --> 28:34.630
Mrs. Thornton!

28:35.400 --> 28:38.343
<i>Mrs. Thornton! Where are you?!</i>

28:41.100 --> 28:42.764
Emily!

28:45.375 --> 28:46.935
Mrs. Thornton!

28:54.083 --> 28:55.651
I'm going outside.

28:55.905 --> 28:57.116
No, Mrs. Thornton.

28:57.141 --> 28:58.190
I won't be gone long

28:58.215 --> 29:00.406
but I need you all to
promise to stay in here.

29:00.841 --> 29:02.341
Do you promise?

29:06.379 --> 29:09.142
Robert, you're in charge while I'm out.

29:09.279 --> 29:10.917
Okay, Mrs. Thornton.

29:17.402 --> 29:19.049
<i>Emily!</i>

29:20.101 --> 29:21.844
<i>Nathan!</i>

29:25.697 --> 29:27.767
<i>Mrs. Thornton!</i>

29:28.660 --> 29:30.520
Emily! Where are you!?

29:30.600 --> 29:32.135
Mrs. Thornton!

29:32.212 --> 29:34.168
Emily, keep calling!

29:34.193 --> 29:36.817
<i>Mrs. Thornton, over here!</i>

29:41.503 --> 29:42.935
Emily!

29:42.960 --> 29:44.575
Mrs. Thornton!

29:45.382 --> 29:46.448
Emily!

29:46.473 --> 29:47.745
Mrs. Thornton!

29:48.777 --> 29:50.247
Emily!

29:51.550 --> 29:53.512
Oh, thank god I found you!

29:53.537 --> 29:55.253
Let's get out of here.

30:05.215 --> 30:06.889
<i>Emily!</i>

30:11.776 --> 30:13.142
Emily!

30:13.167 --> 30:14.898
Nathan!

30:15.253 --> 30:17.733
It's okay. It's gonna be alright.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.736
Here, hold on to me.

30:22.740 --> 30:24.106
Okay.

30:36.653 --> 30:38.119
They're coming!

30:38.780 --> 30:40.382
They're okay!

30:59.226 --> 31:01.111
When are we going home?

31:01.856 --> 31:03.820
When it's safe to do so.

31:04.891 --> 31:06.825
Here comes Constable Grant.

31:11.764 --> 31:14.398
Okay, the wind's died down
enough for us to head back.

31:14.423 --> 31:15.802
Finally.

31:15.934 --> 31:18.155
But before we go I want all
of you to take your canteens

31:18.180 --> 31:20.213
and fill them up at the well, okay?

31:25.660 --> 31:27.387
Hey.

31:27.616 --> 31:29.222
Here you go.

31:29.702 --> 31:31.216
Thanks.

31:39.544 --> 31:41.192
It's safe now.

31:48.015 --> 31:49.647
You okay?

31:57.747 --> 32:00.674
The path that you took up here
is pretty much impassable,

32:00.856 --> 32:03.256
but I found another way home.

32:03.546 --> 32:05.091
Thank you.

32:05.789 --> 32:07.845
And thank you for earlier.

32:08.711 --> 32:10.445
You're not hurt or anything, are you?

32:10.582 --> 32:12.514
No. I'm fine.

32:12.938 --> 32:14.392
You?

32:14.662 --> 32:16.161
I'm fine.

32:18.321 --> 32:20.055
What's wrong?

32:21.434 --> 32:22.944
There's nothing.

32:23.294 --> 32:26.563
If there's something on your
mind please just say it.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.699
Okay, how about this?

32:30.333 --> 32:32.660
How about today you put
both our lives in danger?

32:32.885 --> 32:35.107
How about it wasn't smart for
you to go out after Emily

32:35.132 --> 32:37.143
- under those conditions?
- I take it back.

32:37.168 --> 32:39.057
Whatever's on your mind,
just keep it to yourself.

32:39.082 --> 32:40.995
Elizabeth, what were you thinking?!

32:41.142 --> 32:42.441
I was thinking that I heard Emily

32:42.466 --> 32:44.474
and I wasn't just going
to leave her out there.

32:44.499 --> 32:46.010
I told you I would get her.

32:46.035 --> 32:48.214
- But you didn't. I did.
- With my help.

32:48.239 --> 32:49.884
If I hadn't have gotten to
her she might have died.

32:49.909 --> 32:51.206
You both could have died!

32:57.367 --> 32:59.646
What is this really about?

33:00.130 --> 33:01.869
I don't know what you're talking about.

33:01.894 --> 33:06.396
I just... I'm going to put
this as simple as I can, okay?

33:06.410 --> 33:08.446
My focus is on two things.

33:08.471 --> 33:10.600
Raising Allie and
keeping this town safe,

33:10.625 --> 33:12.838
and today both of those
were put into jeopardy.

33:13.150 --> 33:18.386
So please, in the future, just...
just let me do my job.

33:26.007 --> 33:27.305
Lee!

33:27.520 --> 33:28.966
Jesse!

33:30.200 --> 33:31.636
Lee!

33:31.879 --> 33:33.245
Jesse!

33:33.270 --> 33:36.018
Faith is in Chicago and they
call that the "windy city".

33:36.043 --> 33:38.127
I've been there and I can
tell you it's nothing like

33:38.152 --> 33:39.604
what we just went through.

33:39.665 --> 33:41.655
<i>- Right.</i>
- Any sign of them?

33:41.680 --> 33:42.870
- No sign.
- No.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.799
Well, we passed by Lee's
car about a mile back.

33:44.824 --> 33:46.526
The road was blocked by a fallen tree.

33:46.551 --> 33:48.620
He must have continued to
look for Jesse on foot then.

33:48.645 --> 33:51.155
With this wind he couldn't
have gotten too far.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.170
If you see one of them fire a shot out,

33:53.212 --> 33:54.744
let everybody know. Understood?

33:54.806 --> 33:56.369
- Yep.
- Yep.

33:59.272 --> 34:01.207
Clara, it's going to be alright.

34:01.543 --> 34:03.005
Clara?

34:03.209 --> 34:05.623
First Peter and now Jesse.

34:06.091 --> 34:07.490
Don't think like that.

34:07.515 --> 34:09.148
I can't go through it again, Rosemary.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.106
You won't have to. Think positive.

34:11.232 --> 34:13.396
We're going to find both
of them perfectly healthy.

34:13.543 --> 34:14.886
You'll see.

34:15.315 --> 34:16.888
And when we do,

34:17.541 --> 34:19.766
do we hug them or scold them?

34:20.322 --> 34:21.810
I plan to do both.

34:22.300 --> 34:24.266
Alright. Here we go.

34:24.318 --> 34:25.815
This way.

34:27.347 --> 34:28.786
Jesse!

34:28.812 --> 34:30.146
Lee!

34:32.020 --> 34:34.407
Hi. Did you have a fun field trip?

34:36.612 --> 34:37.877
What?

34:38.054 --> 34:39.822
Robert will tell you all about it.

34:39.847 --> 34:41.580
Won't you, Robert?

34:42.554 --> 34:44.041
Thank you.

34:45.886 --> 34:47.210
Alright, everyone.

34:47.235 --> 34:48.819
School is over for the day.

34:48.844 --> 34:50.210
I'll walk the two of you home

34:50.235 --> 34:52.536
and I'll see the rest of you tomorrow.

34:53.752 --> 34:55.469
Bye.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.138
There you go.

35:08.659 --> 35:09.834
Listen I...

35:09.859 --> 35:12.097
Constable Grant! Have you heard?

35:12.122 --> 35:13.216
Heard what?

35:13.241 --> 35:15.447
Bill's got a search party out
looking for Lee and Jesse!

35:15.472 --> 35:16.808
- They're missing.
- Missing?

35:16.833 --> 35:17.908
<i>In the woods.</i>

35:17.933 --> 35:19.424
Well, do Rosemary and Clara know?

35:19.449 --> 35:20.769
I told them.

35:20.851 --> 35:23.439
<i>What area is Bill looking at?</i>

35:23.464 --> 35:25.222
The men at Lee's mill will know.

35:25.247 --> 35:26.313
I have to go.

35:26.366 --> 35:27.550
I know.

35:34.711 --> 35:36.077
Woah.

35:36.670 --> 35:37.676
Hi, Mrs. Thornton.

35:37.701 --> 35:38.706
Mummy.

35:38.731 --> 35:39.987
Hi, Laura.

35:40.012 --> 35:42.098
There you are, sweetheart.

35:42.247 --> 35:43.683
Ohh.

35:45.233 --> 35:46.298
Something wrong?

35:46.323 --> 35:49.022
No, I'm fine now.

35:51.309 --> 35:52.669
Woah.

35:52.694 --> 35:54.128
Woah.

35:55.230 --> 35:57.656
I don't have a good feeling
about this, Rosemary.

35:57.681 --> 35:59.658
Lee and Jesse both know the woods.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.910
Jesse!

36:03.589 --> 36:05.188
I think that means they found someone.

36:05.213 --> 36:06.832
Alright, come on.

36:06.857 --> 36:09.084
Come on. There you go.

36:13.783 --> 36:15.675
Woah. Woah.

36:16.082 --> 36:17.884
That's Jesse's wagon.

36:23.497 --> 36:25.059
Jesse!

36:26.502 --> 36:28.361
- I was so worried about you...
- I'm sorry.

36:28.386 --> 36:31.324
I tried to get back as soon as I
could but the tree fell down,

36:31.349 --> 36:33.150
it was blocking everything...

36:34.467 --> 36:35.994
I love you.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.863
I love you, too.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.452
I told you everything would be alright.

36:45.139 --> 36:46.572
Where's Lee?

36:50.069 --> 36:52.295
Jesse? Where's Lee?

36:58.764 --> 37:00.264
<i>Lee.</i>

37:04.147 --> 37:05.813
He's still breathing.

37:05.896 --> 37:10.520
It's ragged and faint,
but I hear a heartbeat.

37:10.815 --> 37:12.940
We need to get to the infirmary.

37:14.012 --> 37:18.029
Rosemary, you'll ride
with me in the wagon.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.967
Are they still not home?

37:30.992 --> 37:32.258
No.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.628
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

37:35.606 --> 37:37.273
I guess I'll just start dinner.

37:37.298 --> 37:38.831
- Puppy.
- Horsey?

37:40.563 --> 37:42.595
That's probably Mrs. Coulter.

37:49.247 --> 37:50.518
What happened?

37:52.738 --> 37:54.035
Um...

37:54.060 --> 37:55.261
Lucas.

37:59.518 --> 38:02.009
Jesse couldn't get his wagon
back because of a down tree.

38:02.034 --> 38:03.321
It blocked the trail.

38:03.346 --> 38:05.689
Lee arrived, they were
sawing it together,

38:05.714 --> 38:09.329
the tree gave way and Lee
fell, he hit his head.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.877
Any word on Lee?

38:10.902 --> 38:12.999
No. Nothing yet.

38:13.216 --> 38:15.335
Excuse me.

38:32.362 --> 38:33.728
How's Lee?

38:33.882 --> 38:36.048
His vital signs have improved.

38:36.156 --> 38:37.400
Slightly.

38:41.082 --> 38:43.531
But you don't know if
he's going to be okay.

38:45.173 --> 38:46.831
He suffered a major head injury.

38:46.856 --> 38:49.619
<i>I'm hoping for the best.</i>

38:52.050 --> 38:53.482
Rosemary?

38:53.604 --> 38:55.041
What can I do?

38:55.696 --> 38:57.517
You could comfort Jesse.

38:57.777 --> 38:59.588
He feels terrible.

39:00.175 --> 39:02.091
He's got Clara with him.

39:02.254 --> 39:03.758
Please.

39:04.877 --> 39:06.344
For me.

39:10.790 --> 39:12.924
I still can't believe this is happening.

39:13.093 --> 39:14.192
Poor Rosemary.

39:14.217 --> 39:16.646
Lee's a strong fella,
he'll pull through.

39:16.781 --> 39:18.195
He's got a good doctor in there

39:18.220 --> 39:20.041
and the support of everybody here.

39:20.188 --> 39:21.521
He'll get through this.

39:21.553 --> 39:23.596
I just wish there was
something I could do.

39:23.721 --> 39:25.454
You can join us if you want.

39:25.610 --> 39:27.476
We're holding a candlelight
vigil for Lee.

39:27.501 --> 39:28.833
Who's holding it?

39:28.982 --> 39:30.660
All his men.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.002
Any change?

39:47.783 --> 39:49.054
Are you okay?

39:51.151 --> 39:52.575
It's my fault.

39:52.820 --> 39:54.454
You can't control the weather, Jesse.

39:54.497 --> 39:57.562
I should have left as soon
as the winds picked up.

39:57.879 --> 40:01.524
If I hadn't waited so long none
of this would have happened.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.660
It should be me lying in there, not Lee.

40:03.697 --> 40:05.089
Don't say that.

40:05.114 --> 40:09.449
Jesse, Rosemary doesn't blame you.

40:10.185 --> 40:12.327
She's worried about you.

40:14.133 --> 40:15.748
Worried about me?

40:35.807 --> 40:37.311
Carson?

40:42.248 --> 40:45.403
You are going to use all
your medical know how,

40:46.367 --> 40:50.365
everything you have ever
learned to heal my husband.

40:53.578 --> 40:54.944
Do you hear me?

40:55.082 --> 40:56.830
I hear you, Rosemary.

40:57.861 --> 40:59.709
He is my life.

41:00.929 --> 41:02.670
I know.
