WEBVTT

00:04.045 --> 00:05.255
All right, last thing:

00:05.338 --> 00:07.257
I talked to Donna Martin
this morning,

00:07.340 --> 00:09.801
and she's gonna be returning
to work tomorrow.

00:09.884 --> 00:10.802
Oh, good for her.

00:10.885 --> 00:12.220
Uh, my suggestion?

00:12.303 --> 00:14.723
We, um, we act
like she's never been gone.

00:14.806 --> 00:15.807
Underplay the whole thing.

00:15.890 --> 00:16.933
That's probably a good idea.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.601
I'm sure she'd appreciate that.

00:18.685 --> 00:23.356
All right, if there's nothing
else, let's adjourn.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.818
Have I mentioned
that watching you

00:26.901 --> 00:28.278
run a meeting is
incredibly sexy?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.905
{\an1}You know,
you're a demented woman.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.656
{\an1}But I like that
in a woman.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.617
{\an3}You bastard.
Hi, Rusty.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.453
How dare you send
the cops after me.

00:36.536 --> 00:37.829
What are you talking about?

00:37.912 --> 00:39.080
Yeah, like you didn't finger me

00:39.164 --> 00:40.415
as the guy
who's been bothering Donna.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.459
I didn't say anything
to the cops about you.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.169
Rusty, they questioned everybody
at the station about it.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.295
Yeah, well, they came to my dorm

00:45.378 --> 00:46.421
and made me feel
like a criminal.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.798
Is there some reason you should
feel like a criminal?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.967
You think you're so superior.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.469
Hardly, but I do think

00:52.552 --> 00:54.137
I've earned the right
to be called "Mr. You Bastard."

00:54.220 --> 00:56.222
Yeah, well, someone ought
to knock you down a peg.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.058
All you people.

00:59.142 --> 01:01.311
I hope you and Donna
rot in hell!

01:01.394 --> 01:03.772
{\an1}Was he just blowing off steam
or was that a threat?

01:03.855 --> 01:05.899
I have no idea.

{\an1}Hey.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.639
I'm Donna Martin. I hear you
have a room for rent here.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.893
Very sunny. Ocean view.

03:04.976 --> 03:05.935
Sounds perfect.
I'll take it.

Hi!

03:07.020 --> 03:07.979
Welcome home.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.731
Thank you.
Tom, hey, oh, I'm sorry.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.441
I didn't mean
to interrupt you guys.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.610
I was just leaving.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.618

later on tonight?

03:21.701 --> 03:22.785
{\an3}Very good.

03:22.869 --> 03:23.953
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.122
{\an1}Okay, I'll see you
later, okay?

03:26.205 --> 03:27.540
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.877
{\an3}Bye.
Bye-bye.

03:35.089 --> 03:39.093
{\an1}You know I felt safe
at my parents,

03:39.177 --> 03:41.512
{\an1}but not until this
very second did I really feel

03:41.596 --> 03:43.097
{\an1}like this
whole ordeal is over.

03:43.181 --> 03:45.141
Well, Slan knew it was over

03:45.224 --> 03:46.768
the minute you got that
permanent restraining order.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.478
{\an3}That's why
he left town.

03:48.561 --> 03:52.357
Mm. I still cannot believe
that he is gone. Yes!

03:52.440 --> 03:54.317
Now you get to get your life
back to normal.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.444
Yep. Oh, right,

03:56.527 --> 03:58.655
like you would know anything
about normal.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.114
What? Flirting is normal.

04:00.198 --> 04:00.990
{\an1}Kel,

04:01.074 --> 04:03.159
you know how much
Valerie likes Tom.

04:03.242 --> 04:04.702
{\an1}And I,

04:04.786 --> 04:06.496
I don't know, I just think
it's a little beneath you

04:06.579 --> 04:07.997
to romance him
just to spite her.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.291
That is what I was doing
in the beginning,

04:10.375 --> 04:12.460
but now I really like the guy.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.504
Well, is it worth tearing
Valerie up to find out for sure?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.297
Worth it?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.351
That was really beautiful.

05:11.853 --> 05:14.564
I still can't believe it's
the first song you ever wrote.

05:14.647 --> 05:15.273
Thanks, David.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.401
{\an3}It's, it's been
a long time

05:18.484 --> 05:20.486
{\an3}since I've had someone
in my corner.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.531
What about your parents?

05:23.614 --> 05:24.782
Well, they kind
of disowned me

05:24.866 --> 05:26.075
after I dropped
out of school.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.745
They don't know you have a gift?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.371
Oh, no, they encouraged
my singing...

05:30.455 --> 05:32.415
in the church choir.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.542
My playing in a rock band
on the other hand...

05:34.625 --> 05:37.045
(chuckles)

05:37.128 --> 05:38.546
How long you been doing that?

05:38.629 --> 05:40.590
Long enough to learn
to live out of a suitcase,

05:40.673 --> 05:43.259
get a good night's sleep
on a bus.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.219
Sounds brutal.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.055
Yeah, well, I'm giving myself
six months.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.015
If I don't make something happen
by then,

05:49.098 --> 05:50.767
I'm just gonna
go back to school.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.436
And what?
What, just give up music?

05:53.519 --> 05:56.439
I'm pretty sure the industry
will carry on without me.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.275
See, and I'm pretty sure
if you have a good demo tape,

05:59.358 --> 06:01.152
the industry will sit up
and take notice.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.530
Yeah, well, I'll just have
to take your word on that.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.283
See, I'm way past short on cash.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.452
And last I heard, those demo
facilities cost lots of it.

06:09.535 --> 06:14.791
You know, I've actually got
a pretty nice recording studio

06:14.874 --> 06:15.917
set up at my house.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.628
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

06:18.711 --> 06:22.590
No, just the ones
that can top the charts.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.817
I hope you like it.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.652
Arnie, it's beautiful.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.366
{\an1}Uh, that's okay,
don't worry about us.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.450
We'll get the bags.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.994
{\an3}It's called being
in the zone.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.496
{\an1}Ballplayers do it
all the time.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.831
{\an1}It's like
they're unconscious.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.166
{\an1}I guess
lovers do it, too.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.001
{\an3}You know, a little
Christmas flirtation, fine,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.336
I can handle that,

07:00.419 --> 07:02.213
{\an3}but they're, like, drooling
all over each other.

07:02.296 --> 07:03.840
I know.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.174
Lovers.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.343
(chuckles)
Come on.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.181
So, what'll it be?

07:12.265 --> 07:13.182
{\an1}We have seminars
in history,

07:13.266 --> 07:16.185
{\an3}English,
sciences.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.645
Water torture?

07:17.728 --> 07:18.771
Oh, come on Steve,

07:18.855 --> 07:20.565
{\an1}I think this retreat
sounds terrific.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.358
We can register.

07:24.485 --> 07:27.196
{\an6}I don't think this
is gonna be such
a good idea.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.073
{\an1}Hey, this is
your idea,<i> sister.</i>

07:29.157 --> 07:30.533
Don't you remember?

07:30.616 --> 07:32.326
{\an1}Intellectual stimulation
by day,

07:32.410 --> 07:34.036
{\an1}physical stimulation
at night. (chuckles slyly)

07:34.120 --> 07:37.206
{\an3}This is probably
a good time to tell you

07:37.290 --> 07:39.000
{\an3}that, um, we're not
rooming together.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.126
What?

07:40.209 --> 07:43.921
What, you think I want our
parents sleeping together?

07:44.005 --> 07:46.382
{\an1}Clare, I am <i> not</i> rooming
with my mother.

07:46.465 --> 07:47.884
You don't have to.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.427
{\an1}Uh, I snore
like a howler monkey.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.553
Just so you know.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.973
{\an1}Oh, like father,
like daughter.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.899
It's a beautiful day.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.108
What are you
doing inside?

08:04.192 --> 08:05.985
I'm working.

08:06.068 --> 08:08.946
{\an3}Why don't you come
take a walk with me?

08:09.030 --> 08:10.615
I don't want to.

08:10.698 --> 08:11.949
Come on. Let's go.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.284
No, I don't.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.246
You know, maybe your working
here wasn't such a good idea.

08:17.330 --> 08:21.083
I just thought you could use
some sun is all.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.251
The stage hasn't been
well-prepped,

08:22.335 --> 08:23.586
the lighting's been sloppy.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.589
All right,
what are you saying, Val?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.591
That maybe if you devoted
more time to your job.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.134
Instead of to Kelly?

08:30.218 --> 08:31.761
She has nothing to do with it.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.011
Then what is it?

08:33.095 --> 08:34.554
What, that we're not sleeping
together?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.933
Don't flatter yourself.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.727
You know what?

08:39.809 --> 08:41.979
I'm gonna go take
that walk, okay?

08:43.063 --> 08:44.774
She's only with you
to hurt me.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.987
Tom?

08:52.031 --> 08:53.115
Tom...

08:55.159 --> 08:57.119
look, I'm sorry.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.247
Forget what I said
about your job.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.040
You do it great.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.293
Well, I did, anyway.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.795
What's that supposed to mean?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.964
I quit.

09:17.848 --> 09:19.350
I'm so glad
we're rooming together.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.811
Give us a chance
to get to know each other.

09:21.894 --> 09:22.853
Yeah, me, too.

09:22.937 --> 09:24.021
{\an3}I'm looking
forward to it.

09:24.105 --> 09:26.315
{\an1}Though I feel
like I know you already.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.900
Your father talks
about you so much.

09:27.984 --> 09:29.944
Well, talk I don't mind.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.154
{\an3}It's when he starts
bringing out

09:32.238 --> 09:34.657
{\an3}the old photo albums,
I get a little nervous.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.827
{\an1}Oh, but you were so cute,
even with the braces.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.997
{\an3}Oh, no!
He's the worst.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.498
He's proud of you.

09:42.581 --> 09:46.002
And from what I know,
he has every right to be.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.839
You wouldn't by chance be trying
to butter me up, would you?

09:49.922 --> 09:51.048
I mean every word.

09:51.132 --> 09:53.884
And of course I'm trying
to butter you up.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.594
Well, at least
you're honest about it.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.014
He loves you, Clare.

09:58.097 --> 10:02.810
He would never do anything
that you wouldn't approve of.

10:13.821 --> 10:17.825
(soft synthesizer chords
playing)

10:20.786 --> 10:22.413
{\an3}I love it.

10:22.496 --> 10:24.415
Oh, wait'll I finish
the rest of the mix.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.875
(phone rings)

10:25.958 --> 10:27.376
{\an1}Would you grab that
for me?

10:27.460 --> 10:28.461
{\an3}Hello?

10:28.544 --> 10:31.547
Hi. Uh, is David there?

10:31.630 --> 10:33.215
He sure is.
Would you like to talk to him?

10:33.299 --> 10:34.216
Yeah, I would.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.217
Who is this?

10:35.301 --> 10:36.260
Chloe.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.429
Chloe, hey, it's Donna.

10:38.512 --> 10:41.307
Oh, hey, Donna.
Here, I'll put you on with him.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.892
The guy is a killer.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.562
Hey, Don. What's up?

10:46.645 --> 10:47.730
Hey, "Killer."

10:47.813 --> 10:49.857
What's going on?

10:49.940 --> 10:53.402
Uh, actually, I'm, I'm running
out of material

10:53.486 --> 10:54.487
for my Wardrobe Weather routine.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.031
I was kinda hoping you could
help me write some more.

10:57.114 --> 10:58.324
Well, can't you just recycle?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.076
I mean, there's only
so many ways of saying

11:00.159 --> 11:01.702
"It's going to be 70 and sunny."

11:01.786 --> 11:04.413
I know.
I just, I want to be ready.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.917
Do you have enough to last
through the rest of the week?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.210
I think so.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.628
All right, then how about this?

11:10.711 --> 11:12.254
We'll get together this weekend

11:12.338 --> 11:14.256
and we'll come up with some
new stuff. It'll be great.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.760
David, why do I feel like I'm
getting the brush-off here?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.678
Donna, I'm just helping

11:19.762 --> 11:20.763
{\an1}Chloe out with her demo,
all right?

11:20.846 --> 11:21.764
It's no big deal.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.140
You promise?

11:23.224 --> 11:26.227
I promise. How about this?
As soon as I'm done,

11:26.310 --> 11:28.312
I'll, uh, go pick up
some Chinese and a movie

11:28.396 --> 11:29.438
and we'll spend some time
together.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.274
Thanks. It means a lot,

11:32.358 --> 11:34.568
but I really don't need
a babysitter anymore, David.

11:34.652 --> 11:38.114
All right. Well, I'll, uh, I'll
be here if you need me.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.115
That's nice,

11:39.198 --> 11:43.494
but it won't be necessary.
Everything's fine.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.662
Bye.

12:01.595 --> 12:02.805
That calls for something retro,

12:02.888 --> 12:06.475
maybe a suede jacket
to keep you toasty.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.645
But when those clouds part,

12:09.728 --> 12:12.982
you're gonna want
to go a little bit lighter,

12:13.065 --> 12:17.528
like a sweater,
which you can always peel off

12:17.611 --> 12:20.614
to take advantage of that...

12:20.698 --> 12:22.116
{\an3}MAN:
You bitch.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.503
{\an1}Dad, that's not cream sauce,
is it?

12:34.587 --> 12:36.755
You know that's bad
for your cholesterol.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.215
It's over 300.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.594
which, when combined
with his diabetes, phlebitis,

12:41.677 --> 12:42.511
{\an3}hardening of
the arteries...

12:42.595 --> 12:43.471
Clare!

12:43.554 --> 12:44.472
...and enlarged prostate,

12:44.555 --> 12:45.848
Clare...

12:45.931 --> 12:47.349
My main concern?

12:47.433 --> 12:50.060
Overstimulation of any kind.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.733
I think I'm gonna go get
seconds. Excuse me.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.405
Me, too.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.868
Bye.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.579
Clare, you really think
that was necessary?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.164
{\an1}What?
Well, I know

13:10.247 --> 13:11.790
you're worried about your father
getting hurt,

13:11.874 --> 13:14.001
but it's pretty obvious my mom
has flipped for the guy.

13:14.084 --> 13:14.919
For God's sake, she went

13:15.002 --> 13:16.003
to a seminar on the gold
standard with him.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.088
So what, you're not gonna help
me break them up?

13:18.172 --> 13:19.381
To keep them from having sex?

13:19.465 --> 13:20.382
Heck, no.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.384
I want them
to have sex!

13:22.468 --> 13:24.386
I hope we're having sex
when we're their age.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.638
Steve, I'm serious, okay?

13:25.721 --> 13:27.431
I really need your help.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.395
(both laughing)

13:33.479 --> 13:34.438
I don't know, honey.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.982
I haven't seen my mom look
so happy in so long.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.234
Happy?
Obviously, she's gonna be happy.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.861
Why wouldn't she be?
She's taking my dad.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.905
Taking him from who?

13:42.988 --> 13:45.574
From me.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.702
She's taking him from me.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.254
I had a good time.

13:58.337 --> 14:02.258
{\an1}Good, I'm glad.
So did I.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.885
Do you want
to come in?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.262
{\an3}Sure.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.306
After we straighten some things
out first.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.767
Like what?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.144
Are you trying to hurt Valerie
or something?

14:14.228 --> 14:17.106
Is that what she told you?

14:17.189 --> 14:19.984
Right before she threatened
to fire me

14:20.067 --> 14:21.569
if I didn't stop seeing you.

14:21.652 --> 14:26.282
Tom, she has no right
to do that.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.742
Look, I know you guys don't
like each other very much.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.288
Valerie's a friend of mine.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.416
I don't want to be your way
of getting back at her.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.972
Does that answer your question?

14:50.055 --> 14:52.349
No.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.146
I don't like her.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.775
But that's not why I'm with you.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.240
I should go.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.206
What'd you do?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.125
When?

15:18.208 --> 15:19.835
When she threatened your job?

15:19.918 --> 15:21.545
I quit.

15:35.517 --> 15:38.020
Hey, Rusty.

15:38.103 --> 15:39.313
What do you want?

15:39.396 --> 15:41.023
{\an3}Nothing.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.484
{\an3}It's just, uh, my first day
back in a while.

15:43.567 --> 15:46.028
I kinda wanted to get here
a little early and prepare.

15:46.111 --> 15:49.323
You actually prepare
that routine of yours?

15:49.406 --> 15:51.909
And here I thought you had
an excuse for being bad.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.538
I heard, uh, you
were pretty upset

15:56.622 --> 15:58.082
about the police
questioning you.

15:58.165 --> 15:59.708
I'm really sorry
it put you out.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.877
Yeah, well, save your pity
for someone who needs it.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.879
{\an3}Look, I'm just
trying to be nice.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.297
Yeah, well, don't be, okay?

16:05.381 --> 16:07.925
Everything good?

16:08.008 --> 16:09.718
And if it's not?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.261
Donna?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.055
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:13.138 --> 16:16.058
I think maybe you should leave.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.186
Yeah, well, nobody cares
what you think.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.314
Newsroom keys.

16:23.899 --> 16:25.943
Give them to the commandant.
I'm out of here.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.116
Hey, forget about him.

16:32.199 --> 16:37.079
{\an6}Yeah. It's just with
everything that's
been going on...

16:37.162 --> 16:39.289
Come here.
(sobbing softly)

16:39.373 --> 16:40.874
{\an1}Come here.

16:40.958 --> 16:44.211
{\an3}I just don't want
to be scared anymore.

16:46.046 --> 16:48.090
{\an3}We'll just tell them
that their dating puts

16:48.173 --> 16:50.259
{\an3}too much stress
on our relationship.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.761
{\an1}Yeah, thanks so much
for doing this for me, baby.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.222
And if they don't stop,

16:55.305 --> 16:56.390
{\an3}things between us
will unravel.

16:56.473 --> 16:58.016
{\an1}Yeah.
Yeah?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.477
Oh.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.813
{\an1}Oh!

17:02.896 --> 17:05.648
Hello? That's exactly what
we're trying to stop, okay?

17:05.733 --> 17:09.319
Yeah, okay. Well,
when they break,

17:09.403 --> 17:10.487
we'll move in.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.324
<i>If</i> they break.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.702
Mom!

17:19.663 --> 17:21.790
We can't do this.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.790
What's wrong?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.795
Samantha, I really like you.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.131
{\an1}I think
you already know that.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.175
It's Clare.

17:31.258 --> 17:34.636
She's not happy
about our being together.

17:34.720 --> 17:38.307
Give her time.
She'll get used to the idea.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.266
What about Steve?

17:39.349 --> 17:41.435
You think the same
will be true for him?

17:41.518 --> 17:43.020
Well, I think it should.

17:43.103 --> 17:46.815
{\an3}He does seem pretty
uncomfortable.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.649
{\an3}CHANCELLOR:
I wanted this retreat

17:47.733 --> 17:49.651
{\an3}to bring the four
of us together.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.237
I nev... I-I never dreamed
it could do the opposite.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.865
{\an3}Are you saying that we
shouldn't see each other?

17:54.948 --> 17:58.827
We have two great kids.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.455
{\an1}You know as well
as I do

18:01.538 --> 18:03.165
that they both seem
to have a real problem

18:03.248 --> 18:04.291
with our being together.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.671
As wrong as we think
they may be...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.882
I think we've got to start
listening to them.

18:20.307 --> 18:21.767
You know, working
behind the camera,

18:21.850 --> 18:25.479
{\an3}I look into
everyone's eyes.

18:25.562 --> 18:27.689
{\an3}And you're the only
one I felt was

18:27.773 --> 18:30.651
really talking to me,
the only one I feel...

18:30.734 --> 18:34.321
I don't know, makes
me feel important,

18:34.404 --> 18:38.659
like you really
understand me.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.786
{\an1}That's really nice
of you to say.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.749
Here, wear this.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.917
{\an1}Excuse me?

18:47.000 --> 18:48.919
{\an3}I think you'd look
great in it.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.550
The, the broadcast,
it's about to start.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.969
{\an1}Don't you, uh, have
to get ready or something?

18:57.052 --> 18:58.053
{\an3}No.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.891
Something wrong?

19:02.975 --> 19:06.728
No. I just, um,

19:06.812 --> 19:09.565
I'm, I still feel
a little shaken up by the thing

19:09.648 --> 19:11.358
that happened with Rusty,
that's all.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.819
You don't have to worry.
I'm here.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.573
Mm.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.077
How do I look?

19:22.160 --> 19:24.621
{\an1}Perfect.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.082
Don't.

19:27.165 --> 19:29.209
I know you like me.

19:29.293 --> 19:33.714
Evan, you're, uh, you're making
me very uncomfortable.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.924
The phone calls,

19:36.008 --> 19:38.468
the flowers.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.304
I know you like the attention.

19:40.387 --> 19:42.431
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.766
The sterling silver roses
are beautiful, aren't they?

19:46.560 --> 19:48.520
I picked them because they go
with your eyes.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.273
I'm sorry.

19:51.356 --> 19:53.609
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.485
You know we're meant
to be together!

19:55.569 --> 19:59.448
Look, um, if you sent me
flowers, I'm sorry,

19:59.531 --> 20:00.449
I didn't get them.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.117
{\an1}And, um,

20:02.201 --> 20:03.285
if-if you called me,

20:03.368 --> 20:06.455
you probably got my number
mixed up with somebody else.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.416
Look, if this is about the rat
or trying to run you down...

20:10.751 --> 20:15.339
I'm sorry,
but you made me mad.

20:16.715 --> 20:18.842
{\an1}Brandon!
Brandon, it's him!

20:18.926 --> 20:19.635
{\an3}TRACY:
Who?

20:19.718 --> 20:21.595
{\an1}Evan, he's the one
that stalked me.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.639
Hey, man, whatever she said
to you, it's a lie.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.099
{\an1}No.

20:26.183 --> 20:28.143
You know, Evan,
I think this may be something

20:28.226 --> 20:29.353
for the authorities to sort out.

20:29.436 --> 20:30.812
So I'm gonna call campus
security

20:30.896 --> 20:32.981
{\an5}and have them
come down here.
Put it down.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.359
Evan, don't make this any worse
for yourself than it already is.

20:35.442 --> 20:37.361
I said put it down!

20:37.444 --> 20:38.362
God.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.156
Donna, go lock
the outer doors.

20:41.240 --> 20:41.990
Now!

20:43.408 --> 20:44.660
{\an1}Evan, what
are you doing?

20:44.743 --> 20:45.827
Shut up!

20:45.911 --> 20:49.081
Everybody shut up!

20:49.164 --> 20:51.166
{\an4}Come here.
I want everybody
over here now!

20:51.250 --> 20:53.168
{\an1}Let's go!
Come on!

20:53.251 --> 20:54.544
Right here!

20:56.421 --> 20:57.464
Okay, everybody down.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.007
Everybody down flat

20:59.091 --> 21:01.426
{\an3}on your stomachs.
Do it now!

21:02.552 --> 21:04.471
{\an1}Hands behind your head.
Evan,

21:04.554 --> 21:05.347
take it easy, man.

21:05.430 --> 21:08.141
We're all gonna do
whatever you want.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.393
Why don't you just relax?

21:09.476 --> 21:10.519
I said do it!

21:16.775 --> 21:19.194
All right, Donna, come here.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.029
Donna, get up

21:21.113 --> 21:22.030
and get over here.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.332
All right, look,
I got something to say,

21:32.416 --> 21:34.501
{\an3}and she's going
to get hurt

21:34.584 --> 21:36.336
{\an1}if I don't get a chance
to say it.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.338
{\an1}So get your butt
in the control room, Walsh.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.305
(sobbing softly)

21:49.599 --> 21:50.600
Brandon.

22:04.281 --> 22:05.407
{\an1}Come on.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.369
Get up.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.496
Sit down.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.479
Tracy, get up.

22:36.688 --> 22:37.731
Now!

22:41.026 --> 22:42.277
Focus...

22:42.360 --> 22:43.737
Zoom.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.113
You do a good job,

22:45.197 --> 22:46.948
{\an1}or it's gonna be
the last job you do.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.366
Got it?

22:59.044 --> 23:00.337
(tapping on window):
You ready?

23:00.420 --> 23:03.215
Yeah. Yeah. You're on
in, uh... 30 seconds.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.259
This is 911.

23:06.343 --> 23:07.469
Is this an emergency?

23:07.552 --> 23:08.970
BRANDON:
Hey, Evan. Evan...

23:09.054 --> 23:10.180
I can handle this myself.

23:10.263 --> 23:12.307
Why don't you
let the hostages go?

23:12.390 --> 23:13.183
Did you say hostages?

23:13.266 --> 23:16.186
EVAN:
Why don't you shut your mouth!

23:16.269 --> 23:17.479
Just hang on, sir.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.443
What is that?

23:23.527 --> 23:24.653
What?

23:24.736 --> 23:25.737
What the hell is that?!

23:25.821 --> 23:29.449
I don't know.

23:29.533 --> 23:31.326
Must have just gotten
knocked off its cradle,

23:31.409 --> 23:32.911
that's all.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.329
Nothing funny, Walsh.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.164
If you try cutting me off
once I'm on the air,

23:36.248 --> 23:37.833
I'll see it
on the floor monitor.

23:37.916 --> 23:39.000
How much time?

23:40.252 --> 23:41.461
Ten seconds.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.174
{\an3}What are you
gonna say?

23:46.258 --> 23:48.343
I got plenty to say.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.137
Don't worry about me.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.346
Time!

23:51.429 --> 23:52.639
BRANDON:
You're on in three...

23:52.722 --> 23:53.974
two.....

23:54.057 --> 23:55.058
(switch clicks)

23:55.142 --> 23:58.061
{\an3}(whispers):
Evan.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.521
What?

23:59.604 --> 24:02.649
We're on the air.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.154
Right.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.322
So go ahead.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.534
Just a coffee. Thanks.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.494
EVAN:
Don't start playing your game.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.579
I-I, I don't, I don't...

24:15.662 --> 24:17.038
So go ahead!

24:17.122 --> 24:19.541
What is that?

24:19.624 --> 24:20.709
That's a gun.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.043
He's got a gun!

24:22.127 --> 24:23.670
(concerned murmuring)

24:23.753 --> 24:25.589
So go ahead!

24:25.672 --> 24:28.508
{\an3}I don't know what
you want me to say.

24:30.177 --> 24:32.554
{\an1}Tell them...
that you love me.

24:35.515 --> 24:37.350
Why are you doing this?

24:37.434 --> 24:38.226
Say it!

24:38.310 --> 24:41.062
Okay.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.065
It's true.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.067
I love you.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.573
Now, please...

24:51.656 --> 24:53.033
Please, put down the gun.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.910
Damn right, it's true.

24:54.993 --> 24:58.705
{\an1}See, I kept me
some documentation.

24:58.788 --> 24:59.956
Read this.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.458
Start here.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.883
"January 15th.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.054
"Donna Martin...

25:14.137 --> 25:16.473
"started working
at the station today.

25:19.017 --> 25:21.061
"We hit it right off.

25:21.144 --> 25:23.939
She even winked at me
during the newscast."

25:24.022 --> 25:25.774
Okay. Now...

25:27.484 --> 25:29.152
This.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.948
"January 25th.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.449
"Donna's...

25:39.454 --> 25:40.372
"Donna's...

25:40.455 --> 25:42.165
"Donna's a virgin.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.294
"I think it's
so romantic.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.296
{\an3}"she's only gonna give
herself to one man.

25:48.380 --> 25:52.467
"The way she looks at me
through the camera,

25:52.550 --> 25:54.636
I know that I'm the one."

25:54.719 --> 25:56.096
You see?

25:56.179 --> 25:57.973
You see what I'm talking about?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.266
There's plenty more.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.685
{\an1}Here, I want you
to read this.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.478
I want you to start here.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.029
McCarthy! Jones!

26:13.113 --> 26:14.656
Find every possible
way into the studio.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.157
Get the building blueprints
if you have to.

26:16.241 --> 26:17.242
{\an6}Right on
it, sir.
Peters!

26:17.325 --> 26:19.452
See if you can find someone
close to this guy...

26:19.536 --> 26:20.829
{\an5}Family,
professor,
anything.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.289
We're on it.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.124
Rudman, find the custodian.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.041
I want the air conditioner

26:25.125 --> 26:27.669
in the studio turned off,
the heat bumped.

26:27.752 --> 26:28.920
(phone ringing)

26:31.923 --> 26:32.674
Yeah.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.050
This is Detective Rendell.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.635
We have the building
surrounded.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.803
Is anyone hurt?

26:36.886 --> 26:38.054
No, not yet.

26:38.138 --> 26:40.265
From now on,
this line stays open.

26:40.348 --> 26:41.474
Listen to <i> me.</i>

26:41.558 --> 26:43.518
I want you to do
exactly as I say.

26:43.601 --> 26:44.894
DONNA:
I love you.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.438
Say it again.

26:47.856 --> 26:51.026
I love you.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.152
Like you mean it.

26:55.905 --> 26:56.823
I love you.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.158
Like you mean it!

27:01.328 --> 27:03.330
(Donna sobbing)

27:09.085 --> 27:10.712
Evan...

27:13.465 --> 27:14.799
I love you.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.385
That's good.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.553
{\an1}Yeah.

27:18.636 --> 27:22.724
{\an1}Now everybody
can see what I see.

27:25.810 --> 27:26.811
That you're a damn liar!

27:26.895 --> 27:28.938
BRANDON:
Evan, Evan.

27:29.022 --> 27:30.023
The police are here.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.524
They want to talk to you.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.736
No. No talking.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.572
No deal.

27:37.655 --> 27:38.490
Then you talk <i> for</i> me.

27:38.573 --> 27:40.241
Tell him we're willing
to work with him.

27:40.325 --> 27:42.869
Evan, the cops
want to be reasonable.

27:42.952 --> 27:44.245
They want to work with you.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.539
Well, they better or people
are gonna start dying.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.918
Evan, why don't you
let everybody go

27:50.001 --> 27:51.586
before you do something
really stupid.

27:51.669 --> 27:53.421
Don't tell me what to do!

27:53.505 --> 27:54.839
You hear me? Don't tell me!

27:54.923 --> 27:56.424
I hear you.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.426
Listen, the cops are saying
all you've done

27:58.510 --> 27:59.427
is hold some people up.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.303
You haven't hurt anyone.

28:00.387 --> 28:02.263
I'm sure if you'd
just talk to them...

28:02.347 --> 28:03.431
You may be hearing me,

28:03.515 --> 28:05.475
but you sure as hell
aren't listening.

28:05.558 --> 28:07.894
I said no talking.

28:08.853 --> 28:12.524
Now, put the phone down--<i> now!</i>

28:20.532 --> 28:21.950
Now, where were we?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.493
Oh, yeah. You were just

28:23.576 --> 28:24.744
lying to my face

28:24.828 --> 28:27.455
{\an1}just like you have
every day since we met.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.748
Just leading me on.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.626
No. No, I didn't.

28:31.709 --> 28:32.752
I think you have!

28:32.836 --> 28:36.256
Okay.

28:36.339 --> 28:37.632
You're right.

28:37.715 --> 28:38.967
I led you on.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.510
You're damn right you did.

28:40.593 --> 28:41.469
Always winking at me

28:41.553 --> 28:43.346
behind the camera,
running around the set,

28:43.430 --> 28:44.472
being all friendly.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.807
Hey, it's David.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.475
I'm not here,
so leave a message.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.812
David, where are you?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.355
Look, Donna is in real trouble.

28:52.439 --> 28:55.984
When you get this, um,
turn on CUTV and call me.

28:56.067 --> 28:57.318
EVAN:
This isn't over yet, Donna.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.822
Come here.

29:00.905 --> 29:01.823
All right.

29:01.906 --> 29:04.617
I want you to
repeat after me.

29:04.701 --> 29:08.538
"I am a manipulative..."

29:11.791 --> 29:15.170
"I...

29:15.253 --> 29:16.504
"am...

29:16.588 --> 29:18.548
a manipulative..."

29:18.631 --> 29:23.970
"spiteful bitch."

29:24.053 --> 29:27.056
"spiteful bitch."

29:28.600 --> 29:30.310
EVAN:
Everyone sit tight.

29:30.393 --> 29:31.978
We're gonna be here

29:32.061 --> 29:34.022
a long time.

29:39.777 --> 29:40.987
You okay?

29:41.070 --> 29:42.489
Yeah.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.699
No.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.035
{\an3}Mind if I, uh,
borrow him?

29:47.118 --> 29:48.620
Sure.

29:48.703 --> 29:49.996
Come on, Mom.

29:50.079 --> 29:51.706
Let me buy you a drink.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.377
Dad, I really love you.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.171
Thanks.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.424
I really love you.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.385
I didn't really realize

30:04.469 --> 30:06.721
{\an3}what that meant
until this afternoon.

30:06.804 --> 30:10.350
{\an3}I heard this, uh,
man say that...

30:10.433 --> 30:12.894
to really love someone means

30:12.977 --> 30:15.230
{\an3}wanting more for them
than you want for yourself.

30:15.313 --> 30:18.399
Smart man.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.361
Yeah, the smartest.

30:21.444 --> 30:23.321
{\an3}I don't want you
and Samantha to break up.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.240
Really?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.075
Yeah.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.410
(chuckling)
Oh!

30:29.494 --> 30:31.579
{\an3}Oh, you have no idea
how happy I am

30:31.663 --> 30:33.373
to hear you say that.

30:33.456 --> 30:35.208
{\an3}I'm sorry I tried
to sabotage everything.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.544
You don't need to apologize.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.213
{\an1}You know you're
my number one girl.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.257
{\an1}Don't you know
that nothing

30:42.340 --> 30:43.716
{\an1}is ever going
to change that?

30:43.800 --> 30:45.093
Yeah.

30:49.597 --> 30:51.140
I was getting between
you and the Chancellor

30:51.224 --> 30:53.560
because that's
what Clare wanted.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.937
It felt to me that's
what you wanted, too.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.107
The truth is...

30:59.190 --> 31:00.358
it is.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.527
{\an3}Mom, you're hardly
ever around.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.945
Then suddenly when
you do show up,

31:04.028 --> 31:04.946
it's to be with someone else.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.072
What is that?

31:08.074 --> 31:09.534
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.161
I've been horribly insensitive.

31:12.245 --> 31:13.621
I definitely

31:13.705 --> 31:15.582
should be around more.

31:15.665 --> 31:17.125
Well, judging by the way

31:17.208 --> 31:18.501
you and Arnold
are hitting it off,

31:18.585 --> 31:20.169
I'm sure you'll be
around a lot more.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.462
And that's okay with you?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.798
Oh, Mom, it's more than okay.

31:23.881 --> 31:25.174
That's what I want.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.974
May I borrow her?

31:33.057 --> 31:34.517
Be my guest.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.311
He's all yours.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.191
It's so hot in here.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.610
Did I say you could talk?

31:45.903 --> 31:48.197
What the hell's going on, Walsh?

31:48.281 --> 31:49.657
{\an1}Why's it so damn
hot in here?

31:49.741 --> 31:52.160
I have no idea.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.245
It's gotta be the cops.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.539
Put them on.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.627
(phone ringing)

32:00.710 --> 32:02.170
Yeah, hold on.
It's Walsh.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.838
Yeah.

32:03.921 --> 32:05.506
Yeah, I'm gonna put you on
with him over the P.A. system.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.799
Hold on.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.681
All right, you're on
with Detective Rendell.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.017
{\an1}You turn the damn air
back on!

32:16.100 --> 32:17.852
It's hot in there?
I had no idea.

32:17.935 --> 32:20.063
I'll put a man right on it.

32:20.146 --> 32:21.689
Meantime, how about
a nice cold drink?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.733
You're not coming in here.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.026
Of course not.

32:25.109 --> 32:26.944
{\an1}All right, bring them
to the outer doors.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.404
{\an1}Walsh.

32:28.488 --> 32:29.989
You, go get them.

32:38.081 --> 32:39.040
Look, if anything happens

32:39.123 --> 32:41.042
{\an1}when those doors are unlocked,
I'll start shooting.

32:49.926 --> 32:50.677
Help us, please!
He's gonna kill us!

32:50.760 --> 32:52.095
Put it down.

32:53.096 --> 32:53.721
Evan,

32:53.805 --> 32:56.391
{\an1}please, you've got
to let us go.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.975
I said put it down now!

32:59.644 --> 33:00.978
Get back on the ground
with everybody else.

33:02.563 --> 33:03.731
Go.

33:03.815 --> 33:06.025
(door opening)

33:06.109 --> 33:07.110
Here you go.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.404
Over there on the desk.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.367
Get over there.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.249
Tastes good, doesn't it, Evan?

33:21.332 --> 33:24.419
Yeah, yeah, it tastes good.

33:24.502 --> 33:27.046
I did something for you.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.631
I want you to do
something for me.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.758
I want you to let everyone go.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.552
(scoffs)

33:32.635 --> 33:33.761
No way.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.722
It would show me a lot

33:35.805 --> 33:37.306
if you let them go.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.642
{\an3}Evan, they haven't done
anything to you.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.436
I'm the only one you want.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.895
I'll stay.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.151
{\an1}Donna, get up
and come over here.

33:49.736 --> 33:51.362
Tracy, get back
on the camera.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.618
{\an3}Walsh, you open the doors
and let everybody out.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.245
Everybody get
the hell out of here,

33:59.328 --> 34:00.455
now, let's go.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.539
{\an1}Let's go!

34:04.959 --> 34:07.128
This is good.
This is real good.

34:08.337 --> 34:10.465
{\an1}Walsh, get back
in the control room

34:10.547 --> 34:13.009
where I can see you.

34:25.855 --> 34:27.315
Now, what do you need
to resolve the situation?

34:27.398 --> 34:30.735
(sighs)

34:30.818 --> 34:33.821
I need, uh...

34:33.905 --> 34:36.491
I need everyone to know

34:36.574 --> 34:38.826
what a lying bitch Donna is.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.496
What do you need from me?

34:41.579 --> 34:44.791
I need a, uh...

34:44.873 --> 34:45.833
I need a car.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.377
{\an1}Yeah.

34:48.460 --> 34:50.838
To take us wherever
we want to go.

34:50.922 --> 34:52.340
A car's good, I can do that.

34:52.422 --> 34:54.342
But you've got to give me
some time here though.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.344
So, how about letting Donna go?

34:56.427 --> 34:58.513
She's not a hostage.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.515
She's my girlfriend.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.351
We're in love.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.895
Besides, you heard her--
she wants to stay.

35:05.978 --> 35:07.855
If that's true, you can prove it
by laying your gun down

35:07.939 --> 35:09.148
and letting her walk
if she wants.

35:09.232 --> 35:11.150
I said she wants to.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.485
And if you're right,
then we don't have

35:12.568 --> 35:13.861
a kidnapping problem, do we?

35:13.945 --> 35:16.280
Problem is, there's
only one way to show that.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.074
What do you say?

35:38.636 --> 35:41.097
(sighs)

35:43.474 --> 35:45.393
What is that?!

35:45.476 --> 35:46.394
Who the hell is that?!

35:46.477 --> 35:49.397
Get back, or I'll kill her.

35:49.981 --> 35:50.898
Don't shoot.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.234
Back off. Now.

35:53.317 --> 35:55.194
Walsh, get them the hell
out of here!

36:03.161 --> 36:04.370
Back away.

36:14.672 --> 36:15.840
(door closing)

36:21.012 --> 36:23.431
Negotiation's over.

36:23.514 --> 36:25.725
Get a car within
an hour or Donna dies.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.119
(indistinct radio transmission)

36:46.245 --> 36:47.955
You ever been to Mexico?

36:50.541 --> 36:52.084
{\an3}You're going
to get us killed.

36:54.545 --> 36:57.798
What about South America?

36:57.882 --> 37:00.134
Did you hear what I said?

37:00.217 --> 37:03.262
I hear Brazil is incredible.

37:03.346 --> 37:06.140
Evan, it's over.

37:06.223 --> 37:08.643
No, it's not.

37:08.726 --> 37:09.644
Evan.

37:09.727 --> 37:10.686
I said it's not!

37:12.897 --> 37:15.316
I don't want to go
anywhere with you.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.485
Don't say that.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.487
How can I say anything else?

37:19.570 --> 37:21.030
{\an3}You want me to
care about you--

37:21.113 --> 37:23.199
when did you ever
give me the chance?

37:24.575 --> 37:25.660
When most people like somebody

37:25.743 --> 37:26.994
they ask them out on a date.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.663
You would have said no.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.664
You don't know that.

37:29.747 --> 37:30.957
{\an1}Yes, I do.
How?

37:31.040 --> 37:34.126
{\an1}Because without this
gun I'm a nobody.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.711
{\an3}So now you're a
somebody, is that it?

37:35.795 --> 37:37.046
Now you have all the power.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.464
Damn right.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.383
You don't have anything.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.678
Don't push me here.

37:43.761 --> 37:46.138
{\an3}You want to kill
me, go ahead.

37:47.598 --> 37:50.309
You want to have me,
what's stopping you?

37:50.393 --> 37:51.394
I said don't push me.

37:51.477 --> 37:53.646
I am pushing you.

37:53.729 --> 37:55.898
And you can't handle it,
not even with your gun.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.733
You want to know why?

37:57.817 --> 37:59.860
{\an3}Because you're
a creeper.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.029
{\an6}You creep into my
apartment when I'm gone.
Shut up.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.572
You creep around the
streets following me.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.157
(gun cocking)
I said shut up!

38:05.241 --> 38:07.201
{\an4}DONNA:
Yeah, well, I don't
want a creeper. I want a man.

38:07.284 --> 38:11.205
{\an3}Put down the gun
and be a man.

38:17.795 --> 38:20.297
{\an1}What the hell are you
looking at, huh?!

38:26.512 --> 38:28.347
Get the hell out of here.

38:39.483 --> 38:40.401
Come with me.

38:40.484 --> 38:41.944
No, no, I can't.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.946
{\an1}I've got to stay
with Donna.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.157
{\an6}If anything
happens to you...
It won't.

38:55.833 --> 38:57.918
That was a good move, Evan.
Very smart.

38:58.002 --> 39:00.087
Now, what can I do for you?

39:00.171 --> 39:01.881
Cut him off, Walsh.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.257
Evan, talk to me.

39:03.340 --> 39:04.467
Walsh!

39:07.053 --> 39:09.263
Damn it.

39:09.346 --> 39:11.140
He's gone.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.523
(sobbing)

39:28.908 --> 39:30.159
Don't hate me, Donna.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.162
I just can't live without you.

39:33.245 --> 39:35.122
Detective, with
flash grenades,

39:35.206 --> 39:38.125
we should be able to blind Evan
long enough to subdue him.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.294
Let's hope.

39:40.377 --> 39:41.879
Get in position.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.507
(sniffles)

39:44.590 --> 39:46.175
Will you come sit next to me?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.575
I didn't know
how much you cared.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.166
I just wanted us to be together.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.837
It's embarrassing.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.964
No, it's not.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.757
It's sweet.

40:28.592 --> 40:32.304
You know, it makes me think

40:32.388 --> 40:34.849
this could actually
work out between us.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.519
You're just saying that.

40:45.317 --> 40:47.903
I've never been
to South America.

40:51.448 --> 40:53.951
I hear the rain forest is
supposed to be incredible.

40:57.913 --> 41:00.124
We could be together there.

41:02.918 --> 41:04.378
Would you take care of me?

41:04.461 --> 41:06.964
Like a queen.

41:12.803 --> 41:15.931
What about your boyfriend?

41:18.976 --> 41:21.228
{\an1}Everyone knows
I care about you.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.231
Really?

41:24.315 --> 41:26.442
{\an1}Brandon...

41:27.610 --> 41:29.987
tell him.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.781
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, Evan.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.201
Donna's been talking
for a long time

41:35.284 --> 41:36.744
about breaking up with David.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.787
Actually she's
been telling me

41:38.871 --> 41:41.123
about the crush
that she has on you.

41:43.167 --> 41:44.835
No lie?

41:44.919 --> 41:46.837
{\an3}BRANDON:
No, no lie.

41:46.921 --> 41:48.380
In fact, she
just asked me

41:48.464 --> 41:51.759
this morning about the
Valentine's Day party

41:51.842 --> 41:53.302
I was gonna have next week.

41:53.385 --> 41:54.637
{\an3}She wanted
to invite you.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.013
Valentine's Day?

41:56.096 --> 42:00.434
Mm-hmm. So everyone
can see us together.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.144
{\an3}Kiss me.

42:02.228 --> 42:06.148
No, not with a gun
pointed at me.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.802
Now do you believe
how much I care?

42:35.844 --> 42:38.264
Yeah.

42:42.518 --> 42:43.936
(Evan grunting)

42:48.232 --> 42:49.441
Don't move!

42:53.279 --> 42:54.863
You wouldn't.

42:55.948 --> 42:57.616
Yes, I would.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.827
Go, go! Go, go, go, go, go!

42:59.910 --> 43:01.287
Turn over on
your stomach.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.538
{\an3}Put your hands
behind your back.

43:02.621 --> 43:03.664
{\an3}Don't move.

43:03.747 --> 43:04.957
Hook him up.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.542
Get him cuffed.

43:13.382 --> 43:15.342
You said you wouldn't leave me.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.011
I lied.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.185
(breathing heavily)
