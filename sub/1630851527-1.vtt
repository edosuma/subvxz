00:06.040 --> 00:07.973
Viewers like you make
this program possible.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.871
Support your local PBS station.

00:32.342 --> 00:33.999
[light music]

01:25.085 --> 01:27.052
Could I have the--?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.537
Thank you.

01:31.367 --> 01:33.921
[light music]

01:36.199 --> 01:38.132
We'll keep it in overnight.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.583
Their owner can
pick it up tomorrow.

01:42.654 --> 01:45.346
[cat meowing]

01:46.140 --> 01:48.349
I'll get cleaned up.

01:51.628 --> 01:53.078
[knocking]

01:54.907 --> 01:56.392
Finished up already?

01:56.426 --> 01:57.979
Being able to
visualise the break

01:58.014 --> 02:00.189
before I operated
certainly made life easier.

02:00.223 --> 02:02.191
It looks like a clean fracture.

02:02.225 --> 02:03.985
She's a young, healthy cat.

02:04.020 --> 02:05.677
Should heal well.

02:05.711 --> 02:08.162
Every practice in the country
should have an X-ray machine.

02:08.197 --> 02:10.026
Oh, well unfortunately
it doesn't come cheap.

02:10.060 --> 02:11.614
[cat meowing]

02:12.304 --> 02:14.134
I shall be sorry to see you go.

02:14.168 --> 02:15.549
We've got used to
having you around

02:15.583 --> 02:17.758
these last two weeks,
haven't we?

02:17.792 --> 02:20.036
Aye, it's been lovely.

02:20.070 --> 02:21.589
Glad to help out.

02:21.624 --> 02:23.177
A good vet is hard to find.

02:23.212 --> 02:25.179
I hope your boss
appreciates how lucky he is.

02:25.214 --> 02:26.836
In his own special way.

02:26.870 --> 02:28.458
Deep down.

02:28.493 --> 02:30.322
If you ever get the yearning
for home,

02:30.357 --> 02:33.222
the lad you're covering for
is joining up.

02:33.256 --> 02:36.121
Six months' time,
there's a job if you want it.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.778
That's a very kind offer, Bill,
but--

02:37.812 --> 02:40.884
Veterinary practice
isn't all about farm animals.

02:40.919 --> 02:44.164
Pets is where the future lies.

02:44.198 --> 02:47.167
I don't need your answer
right away.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.962
Take time to think on it, eh?

02:57.591 --> 03:00.283
[light music]

03:13.814 --> 03:16.610
[street chatter]

03:20.786 --> 03:23.168
[Vendor] Bring the lads home.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.757
Read all about it!

03:25.791 --> 03:27.379
Read all about it!

03:27.414 --> 03:28.898
[indistinct]

03:28.932 --> 03:29.933
Thanks, Craig.

03:29.968 --> 03:31.418
[car honking]

03:31.452 --> 03:34.352
[Vendor] Read all about it!
[continues shouting]

03:35.560 --> 03:38.425
[uplifting music]

03:43.809 --> 03:44.845
Pint, Jim?

03:44.879 --> 03:46.260
I can't stop.

03:46.295 --> 03:48.366
Ma will string me up if
I'm not home for my tea.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.781
You always were a mummy's boy.

03:49.815 --> 03:51.472
Get a pint at the till for me.

03:51.507 --> 03:53.267
Oh, you're hanging around long
enough to drink it, then?

03:53.302 --> 03:54.613
You're not going anywhere,
are you, Stevie?

03:54.648 --> 03:56.201
Ha, not likely.

03:58.548 --> 04:01.413
[uplifting music]

04:02.034 --> 04:03.519
Hold on!

04:06.694 --> 04:08.903
Dumbarton Road, please.

04:08.938 --> 04:11.975
[uplifting music]

04:22.986 --> 04:24.264
[woman] James!

04:27.163 --> 04:29.130
Haggis and tatties?

04:29.165 --> 04:30.822
Bet you can't get grub like that

04:30.856 --> 04:32.513
down where you've been, can you?

04:32.548 --> 04:34.515
I don't know.
Mrs. Hall cooks it.

04:35.758 --> 04:37.035
No.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.555
Nothing like the taste of home.

04:39.589 --> 04:42.765
And here's a pot of tea
to go with it.

04:42.799 --> 04:43.904
Thanks, Mum.

04:43.938 --> 04:45.388
And maybe we won't have to wait

04:45.423 --> 04:48.529
until next Easter for you
to show your face again.

04:48.564 --> 04:50.082
Hopefully not.

04:51.463 --> 04:53.534
That practice of Bill's
is always busy.

04:53.569 --> 04:56.537
It's a lovely wee business
he's setup for himself there.

04:56.572 --> 04:57.987
And it's not too far away.

04:58.021 --> 04:59.540
And you don't have
to go traipsing out

04:59.575 --> 05:03.026
in the cold at goodness knows
what time in the morning.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.097
Bill's been talking.

05:05.132 --> 05:08.273
Oh, ho, I'm so happy
for you, love!

05:09.343 --> 05:10.758
How's Dad doing?

05:10.793 --> 05:12.277
Soldiering on.

05:12.312 --> 05:15.315
At his age he struggles to
get picked out the line.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.041
I'm doing the odd bit
of needlework.

05:18.076 --> 05:20.112
Don't worry, we get by.

05:20.147 --> 05:22.183
Haggis, neeps, and tatties, eh?

05:22.218 --> 05:24.151
Somebody wants to
keep our boy home.

05:24.185 --> 05:28.017
Well he needs a decent meal
in him for the journey.

05:28.051 --> 05:30.882
It'll be six months
before he has another.

05:30.916 --> 05:32.366
You're taking the job then?

05:32.401 --> 05:33.885
Of course he is!

05:33.919 --> 05:36.128
I thought you made a bit of
a life for yourself down there?

05:36.163 --> 05:39.615
Aye, but home
is where the heart is.

05:39.649 --> 05:40.995
Is it not, James?

05:41.030 --> 05:43.722
Aye, Mum, it is.

05:43.757 --> 05:46.173
[dog panting]

05:46.207 --> 05:48.209
Good lad.

05:49.279 --> 05:50.384
Good lad.

05:54.284 --> 05:58.081
[train whistle blowing]

06:00.118 --> 06:03.328
[uplifting music]

06:21.242 --> 06:23.590
How's things with you then?

06:23.624 --> 06:25.005
Good grief.

06:25.039 --> 06:26.834
Two weeks away and I can
barely understand you.

06:26.869 --> 06:28.526
The place rubs off on you.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.975
Well, if you want
any of the farmers

06:30.010 --> 06:31.011
to understand
a word you're saying

06:31.045 --> 06:32.530
you'll have to rub it off again.

06:32.564 --> 06:34.394
Is that chocolate?

06:34.428 --> 06:35.740
Huh?

06:35.774 --> 06:36.672
No, no.

06:36.706 --> 06:37.949
No, I don't think so.

06:37.983 --> 06:39.744
That reminds me,
a present from Mrs. Hall.

06:39.778 --> 06:41.159
Easter egg.

06:43.713 --> 06:47.234
I'm afraid Jess got at it
while her back was turned.

06:48.062 --> 06:49.098
Uh, good break?

06:49.132 --> 06:49.961
Parents holding up all right?

06:49.995 --> 06:51.445
Aye, just about.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.102
Dad's struggling with his back.

06:53.136 --> 06:56.036
Mum's picked up some
extra work to get them by.

06:56.070 --> 06:57.417
How's it been here?

06:57.451 --> 06:58.763
Oh, you know how it
is with my brother.

06:58.797 --> 07:00.592
Peace and tranquillity.

07:00.627 --> 07:02.767
Mrs. Hall just about manages
to keep him in line.

07:02.801 --> 07:05.114
And you've been your
usual industrious self?

07:05.148 --> 07:07.944
Oh, you know me,
nose to the grindstone.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.638
[James] Where are we going?

07:11.672 --> 07:13.329
Oh, Benson's got
a load of ewes lambing.

07:13.363 --> 07:15.055
So he's letting you
off the leash a bit more?

07:15.089 --> 07:18.058
Happily still tethered to
the dispensary in the main.

07:18.092 --> 07:20.854
Siegfried's meeting us there.

07:21.786 --> 07:24.651
[uplifting music]

07:39.044 --> 07:40.494
Good afternoon, Mr. Farnon.

07:40.529 --> 07:41.702
Isn't it though?

07:41.737 --> 07:43.048
[bleating sheep]

07:43.083 --> 07:45.430
I see my gallant crew
have arrived.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.052
Clearing the decks
for their captain.

07:47.087 --> 07:49.469
Where's your tie, man?

07:49.503 --> 07:50.228
Oh, I...

07:50.262 --> 07:51.988
I left it in the car.

07:52.023 --> 07:53.196
A well tied tie is the mark--

07:53.231 --> 07:54.991
Mark of a well made man.

07:55.026 --> 07:56.476
Good to see you again,
Siegfried.

07:56.510 --> 07:57.925
Yes, you too.

07:57.960 --> 07:59.927
I had the fortitude to deal with
the caseload in your absence.

07:59.962 --> 08:01.342
Lesser men would have failed.

08:01.377 --> 08:03.379
I'm sure that's true.
What have you got?

08:03.413 --> 08:05.692
A big lamb, stuck right
in the birthing canal.

08:05.726 --> 08:08.039
My great mitts, no use
at bringing her out.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.558
It's a good job we've got those

08:09.592 --> 08:11.560
little lady hands of yours,
Mr. Herriot.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.147
The head's stuck fast.

08:13.182 --> 08:15.529
I can barely get
a finger inside.

08:15.564 --> 08:16.979
Now have you got
hold of the leg yet?

08:17.013 --> 08:18.601
Trying to.

08:18.636 --> 08:20.292
Come on, man, there's no need
to make such a meal of it.

08:20.327 --> 08:21.604
We're not getting
paid by the hour.

08:21.639 --> 08:22.881
I'm just trying to
bring it around now.

08:22.916 --> 08:24.400
She should come out after that.

08:24.434 --> 08:25.953
I can always take the reins
if it would help, James.

08:25.988 --> 08:27.852
I'm happy, Siegfried.
Thank you very much.

08:27.886 --> 08:29.681
Oh, hello.
Who's this little chap?

08:29.716 --> 08:31.234
[Rob] Herbert.

08:31.269 --> 08:33.685
Poor little lamb's mother
won't have him at any price.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.445
She took spite to him at birth.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.240
Though she thinks the world
of her other lamb.

08:37.275 --> 08:40.002
Yeah, sounds very reminiscent
of my upbringing.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.901
You were given
the love you deserved.

08:42.936 --> 08:44.316
He's been fending for himself.

08:44.351 --> 08:47.803
He goes from one to
another chancing his arm.

08:47.837 --> 08:50.530
Hey, Herbert.

08:51.738 --> 08:52.946
Mind yourself.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.844
Might get a kick.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.503
They don't always let him
have it. It's a crying shame

08:58.538 --> 09:01.126
but you've got to let
nature run its course.

09:04.129 --> 09:05.510
Here we go.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.098
It's coming.

09:08.409 --> 09:10.170
[bleating sheep]

09:12.862 --> 09:14.933
Oh, there she is.

09:14.968 --> 09:17.108
What a grand 'un.

09:19.697 --> 09:22.251
[light music]

09:23.459 --> 09:24.633
There we go.

09:25.634 --> 09:28.222
[light music]

09:33.124 --> 09:35.436
Hello, little one.

09:35.471 --> 09:36.506
Hello.

09:41.995 --> 09:43.444
That's good.

09:43.479 --> 09:45.274
A healthy wee lamb.

09:45.308 --> 09:47.069
Got there in the end.

09:47.103 --> 09:50.141
[bleating lamb]

09:52.074 --> 09:54.697
[dog barking]

09:54.732 --> 09:56.216
Is that one of yours?

09:56.250 --> 09:57.148
No.

09:58.045 --> 09:59.702
It belongs to Alderson.

09:59.737 --> 10:02.636
[dog barking]

10:02.671 --> 10:06.364
That'll be the second
time he's been over.

10:07.572 --> 10:09.919
[dog barking]

10:14.579 --> 10:17.202
[door opening]

10:19.239 --> 10:20.654
Oh, it's only you.

10:20.689 --> 10:23.381
Only, Mrs. Hall? Only?

10:23.415 --> 10:25.625
How far I've fallen
in your estimation.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.902
What's this?

10:26.936 --> 10:28.041
It's a bag.

10:28.075 --> 10:29.663
Yes, no, I see what it is.

10:29.698 --> 10:30.837
Then why'd you ask?

10:30.871 --> 10:32.908
-I meant--
-I got it for Tristan.

10:32.942 --> 10:34.357
I see.

10:34.392 --> 10:36.152
We can't have him
filling his pockets

10:36.187 --> 10:38.603
with scissors and goodness
knows what, the holes they make.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.501
I'll be darning night and day.

10:40.536 --> 10:42.607
You shouldn't have
done this, Mrs. Hall.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.471
-I didn't.
-You didn't?

10:44.505 --> 10:45.817
-You did.
-Did I?

10:45.852 --> 10:47.267
I took the money
out of the pine pot.

10:47.301 --> 10:49.062
I knew you'd want to get
him something special

10:49.096 --> 10:50.788
in recognition of
all his hard work.

10:50.822 --> 10:53.963
I thought you might give it
to him on his birthday.

10:53.998 --> 10:55.620
But it's not till the summer.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.691
Well, the best
preparation for tomorrow

10:57.726 --> 10:59.244
is getting it done today.

10:59.279 --> 11:01.074
Your heart is in the right place

11:01.108 --> 11:03.214
but I would have preferred it
if you'd asked me first.

11:03.248 --> 11:04.698
Well, I couldn't have done that.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.010
Why not?

11:06.044 --> 11:08.046
You might have said no.

11:08.081 --> 11:11.049
Yes, well, I'm sorry to put my
foot down like this, Mrs. Hall,

11:11.084 --> 11:13.155
but you can't give it to him.

11:13.189 --> 11:15.157
Are you aware of what this
mysterious contraption

11:15.191 --> 11:16.710
in the hall is for?

11:16.745 --> 11:18.022
It slips off.

11:18.056 --> 11:20.334
Because you don't
put it on properly.

11:21.646 --> 11:23.924
You hounded that boy
for the last five years

11:23.959 --> 11:25.374
to pass his exams.

11:25.408 --> 11:27.583
Now that he has,
the least you could do

11:27.617 --> 11:29.240
is reward him for it.

11:29.274 --> 11:31.035
You said you were proud of him.

11:31.069 --> 11:33.554
I am, it's not... I just.

11:33.589 --> 11:35.591
I'm not sure about qualification
letters after his name.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.731
It's very ostentatious,
very showy.

11:37.766 --> 11:40.009
Now you've got it next to
your name by the front door.

11:40.044 --> 11:41.286
I earned that qualification!

11:41.321 --> 11:43.392
What, and Tristan didn't?

11:43.426 --> 11:46.257
You know there was something
I was about to do.

11:48.466 --> 11:51.158
[dog barking]

11:53.782 --> 11:56.612
Oh, you're back.

11:56.646 --> 11:59.442
Good to see you, Mrs. H.

11:59.477 --> 12:00.547
Sit yourself down.

12:00.581 --> 12:03.067
I've made you dinner.
How was Glasgow?

12:03.101 --> 12:05.069
Your mother must have been
so pleased to see you.

12:05.103 --> 12:06.864
I want to hear all about it.

12:06.898 --> 12:07.934
There isn't much to tell.

12:07.968 --> 12:10.315
I don't believe a word of it.

12:10.350 --> 12:13.663
Oh, it's good to have you home.

12:14.837 --> 12:17.391
[light music]

12:27.643 --> 12:29.127
I've got a little list.

12:29.162 --> 12:30.784
I've got the little list.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.821
James, only a few for you today.

12:33.683 --> 12:34.926
Tristan, if you wouldn't mind.

12:34.961 --> 12:36.825
Dispensary,
mixing the medicines,

12:36.859 --> 12:39.241
feeding the animals, got it.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.933
We could be putting
Tristan to better use.

12:41.968 --> 12:44.971
Maybe it's time he
had a list of his own.

12:45.005 --> 12:46.835
To conquer the ziggurat of life,

12:46.869 --> 12:49.009
one must climb the first step.

12:49.044 --> 12:50.217
Quite right, big brother.

12:50.252 --> 12:52.047
Crawl before you can walk.

12:52.081 --> 12:53.807
We'd be freed up to do
the farm work more quickly.

12:53.842 --> 12:56.776
And it would allow us to
take on more small animals.

12:56.810 --> 12:59.088
We are principally
a farm practice.

12:59.123 --> 13:01.090
More and more people
are keeping pets now.

13:01.125 --> 13:03.299
Yes, why people keep animals
as pets is beyond me.

13:03.334 --> 13:05.370
A dog should have a function.

13:05.405 --> 13:08.546
Let it be used for
farm work, for shooting,

13:08.580 --> 13:11.445
for guiding, not just
hanging about the place.

13:11.480 --> 13:12.619
[phone ringing]

13:12.653 --> 13:13.965
Where's Jess?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.898
What about Mrs. Tompkins
budgerigar, for instance.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.038
It only needs its beak clipped.

13:18.073 --> 13:20.351
Surely Tristan can take
that one on by himself.

13:20.385 --> 13:22.974
Yes, I suppose there's only
so much harm he can do.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.391
What?

13:26.426 --> 13:28.117
Aren't you sick of not being
giving any responsibility?

13:28.152 --> 13:30.050
On the contrary,
I am at my happiest

13:30.085 --> 13:32.570
when he doesn't allow
me to do anything.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.228
It means I get to
finish my crossword.

13:35.262 --> 13:36.919
That were Mr. Benson.

13:36.954 --> 13:38.058
He's had a dog attack his sheep.

13:38.093 --> 13:40.302
Sounded pretty upset about it.

13:42.235 --> 13:43.236
James.

13:45.134 --> 13:47.688
[light music]

13:55.075 --> 13:57.008
Were that bloody dog
from next door again.

13:57.043 --> 13:58.389
The Aldersons'?

13:58.423 --> 14:00.770
Yeah, I caught him and
tied him up in our shed.

14:00.805 --> 14:03.221
I have half a mind to shoot
the damn thing me self.

14:03.256 --> 14:05.189
Let's hope it
won't come to that.

14:07.674 --> 14:09.158
Good god.

14:09.918 --> 14:12.610
[ominous music]

14:22.068 --> 14:24.311
-This one's still alive.
-This one too.

14:25.899 --> 14:29.109
[heavy breathing]

14:31.042 --> 14:32.181
Siegfried.

14:32.216 --> 14:33.769
There's nothing here.

14:33.803 --> 14:35.909
Not a single bite mark,
no blood.

14:35.944 --> 14:37.255
I can't find anything
wrong with them.

14:37.290 --> 14:38.947
This one's rasping a little.

14:38.981 --> 14:41.052
See how her head's
lolling like she's drunk.

14:41.087 --> 14:42.053
[Rob] What's that you're saying?

14:42.088 --> 14:43.606
They're still alive, Rob.

14:43.641 --> 14:44.987
Oh, thank God for that.

14:45.022 --> 14:46.886
Well, let's not be too hasty.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.439
There's still something
seriously wrong with them.

14:48.473 --> 14:49.923
Maybe it's something
they've eaten.

14:50.648 --> 14:52.892
I shouldn't think so.

14:53.962 --> 14:55.204
Can't calcium
deficiency be brought on

14:55.239 --> 14:56.826
by sudden exertion or stress?

14:56.861 --> 14:59.968
So it might occur after
being chased by a dog.

15:00.002 --> 15:02.142
They need a calcium injection.

15:02.591 --> 15:03.972
I've got one.

15:04.006 --> 15:06.250
I have more in the car.

15:13.119 --> 15:15.984
[light music]

15:23.543 --> 15:24.647
Good morning.

15:24.682 --> 15:25.579
Morning.

15:26.580 --> 15:29.342
[light music]

15:36.038 --> 15:38.558
[knocking]

15:38.592 --> 15:41.285
[light music]

15:44.012 --> 15:45.875
Hello, who is it?

15:45.910 --> 15:48.050
It's the vet, Mrs. Tompkin.

15:50.397 --> 15:51.640
Come in.

15:51.674 --> 15:53.228
Peter's in here, love.

15:53.262 --> 15:57.370
Poor little fellow can barely
eat with beak as it is.

15:57.404 --> 15:59.820
And I'm worried about him.

15:59.855 --> 16:02.133
He's my only companion, you see.

16:02.168 --> 16:04.342
Mind the table.

16:04.377 --> 16:05.412
Oh.

16:07.552 --> 16:08.968
Don't you worry.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.314
We'll soon see him right.

16:10.348 --> 16:13.006
Mr. Farnon, you do
sound different today.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.594
Have you a cold?

16:14.628 --> 16:17.424
No, it's Tristan,
Siegfried's brother.

16:17.459 --> 16:19.702
Oh, I see.

16:20.255 --> 16:22.429
Well, I don't actually.

16:22.464 --> 16:23.430
Barely.

16:23.465 --> 16:25.985
Not for 10 years now.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.608
Thankfully I've got this one.

16:28.642 --> 16:30.575
His singing keeps you company?

16:30.610 --> 16:34.027
It's a funny thing, but
Peter has never said owt.

16:34.062 --> 16:36.202
I think he's lazy.

16:36.236 --> 16:38.859
But I likes having him near me.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.759
I hear you fluttering, don't I?

16:41.793 --> 16:44.313
Yes, well, I can see
his beak has got long.

16:44.348 --> 16:46.281
Nothing I won't be
able to sort out.

16:46.315 --> 16:48.248
We'll have him done in a jiffy.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.113
Right, come on, Peter.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.496
Good lad, there he is.

16:54.530 --> 16:55.980
Come on then.

16:56.912 --> 16:58.396
Come on then, you.

16:59.087 --> 17:02.262
There he is, good boy, good boy.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.612
[clock ticking]

17:12.617 --> 17:13.929
Oh, God.

17:13.963 --> 17:16.173
Is something the matter, dear?

17:16.966 --> 17:19.555
He's a little love, isn't he?

17:19.590 --> 17:21.040
Yes.

17:22.006 --> 17:25.906
Um, I just need to, um...

17:27.391 --> 17:29.186
Mrs. Tompkin I think
it would be best

17:29.220 --> 17:31.809
if I did this in more
of a clinical setting.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.776
I'll take him back
to the surgery

17:33.811 --> 17:37.746
where I've got more... tools.

17:37.780 --> 17:39.161
Oh.

17:39.196 --> 17:41.784
If you're sure it's
not too much trouble.

17:41.819 --> 17:43.648
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

17:43.683 --> 17:44.822
Don't you worry.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.307
He's in perfectly capable hands.

17:48.274 --> 17:51.380
[farcical music]

18:15.197 --> 18:17.234
It were a hell of a thing.

18:17.268 --> 18:19.546
I thought I'd lost
the lot of them.

18:19.581 --> 18:22.618
Me heart were up here
where me throat should be.

18:22.653 --> 18:24.827
Thankfully the dog just
gave them a bit of a chase.

18:24.862 --> 18:26.553
Still doesn't excuse it.

18:28.866 --> 18:30.833
You were lucky not to lose any.

18:30.868 --> 18:32.249
[bleating sheep]

18:32.283 --> 18:33.836
[thudding]

18:33.871 --> 18:36.011
Mr. Farnon!

18:39.773 --> 18:41.050
I think she's in labour.

18:41.085 --> 18:42.707
We'll need water
and soap, please, Rob.

18:42.742 --> 18:44.330
I've got some by the pens.

18:46.953 --> 18:48.920
It's happening very quickly.

18:48.955 --> 18:50.025
Hold on a second.

18:50.059 --> 18:51.578
Easy girl, easy.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.236
Easy, girl.

18:54.271 --> 18:55.582
Was it brought on by the dog?

18:55.617 --> 18:57.653
Could well have been.

18:57.688 --> 18:59.138
Hang on.

19:00.518 --> 19:02.071
Hold on to her.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.144
I've got it.

19:10.770 --> 19:12.151
Right.

19:12.185 --> 19:15.878
Let's see if we can't
get this chap going.

19:16.672 --> 19:19.261
[sombre music]

19:39.005 --> 19:40.282
Sorry, Rob.

19:41.904 --> 19:43.492
Nothing we could do.

19:50.499 --> 19:52.639
They have so many
born each year,

19:52.674 --> 19:55.124
you'd be forgiven for thinking
it wouldn't hit them hard.

19:55.159 --> 19:56.505
Mm, but it does.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.852
One of us should drop
by the Aldersons'.

19:58.887 --> 20:00.129
They need to know this happened.

20:00.164 --> 20:01.338
There's no guarantee
the dog did this.

20:01.372 --> 20:03.098
We both know that
level of distress

20:03.132 --> 20:04.410
can cause a ewe to miscarry.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.515
Their dog was loose
in Rob's field.

20:06.550 --> 20:10.312
If something isn't done
it could well happen again.

20:10.347 --> 20:14.661
Hard as it is, one of us
needs to tell them.

20:14.696 --> 20:16.939
I'll pass by on my way through.

20:18.113 --> 20:20.978
[light music]

20:41.792 --> 20:42.862
Trist.

20:42.896 --> 20:44.035
Mm-hm?

20:44.070 --> 20:45.347
What are you up to?

20:45.382 --> 20:48.488
Mrs. H, you do have
a suspicious mind.

20:50.939 --> 20:52.561
It's not what it looks like.

20:52.596 --> 20:54.287
Is it a dead budgie?

20:54.322 --> 20:55.357
Yes.

20:55.392 --> 20:57.704
Then it's exactly
what it looks like.

20:57.739 --> 20:59.188
I didn't kill it.

20:59.223 --> 21:01.121
Well, I suppose I did,
but it was an accident.

21:01.156 --> 21:03.296
Entirely natural causes.

21:03.331 --> 21:05.091
All I did was try to pick it up.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.782
So not entirely natural.

21:06.817 --> 21:08.336
It must have been
on its last legs

21:08.370 --> 21:10.372
and the shock just
finished him off.

21:10.407 --> 21:12.650
I didn't have the heart
to tell Mrs. Tompkin.

21:12.685 --> 21:14.169
The bird's all she has.

21:14.203 --> 21:15.722
I don't see any way out of it.

21:15.757 --> 21:19.657
Unless you somehow learnt
the powers of resurrection.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.694
[light music]

21:21.728 --> 21:23.765
Mrs. Hall, you're a genius.

21:23.799 --> 21:25.387
-I am?
-You are.

21:27.009 --> 21:29.909
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, oi.

21:29.943 --> 21:31.842
What about this one?

21:31.876 --> 21:33.361
Ah, yes.

21:33.395 --> 21:36.640
Don't worry, I'll give him
a proper burial later.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.989
[farcical music]

21:41.748 --> 21:43.578
Good G...

21:51.655 --> 21:53.415
Scruff!

21:55.314 --> 21:56.625
Scruff!

22:01.492 --> 22:02.390
[dog barking]

22:02.424 --> 22:03.356
Scruff!

22:04.840 --> 22:07.498
[uplifting music]

22:16.887 --> 22:18.440
He was over at Benson's again.

22:18.475 --> 22:20.787
In with Rob's sheep.

22:20.822 --> 22:23.790
I'm afraid he lost
one of his lambs.

22:23.825 --> 22:26.483
Jenny, what did
I say would happen

22:26.517 --> 22:28.243
to that dog of yours
if he got out again?

22:28.277 --> 22:29.831
He didn't attack any of them.

22:29.865 --> 22:30.970
There were no bite marks

22:31.004 --> 22:32.523
but one of the ewes miscarried.

22:32.558 --> 22:34.939
We can't be sure it was
anything to do with Scruff.

22:34.974 --> 22:37.356
But he was chasing
them around before.

22:38.253 --> 22:41.463
Dad, what are you
gonna do to him?

22:42.844 --> 22:44.259
What are you gonna do to my dog?

22:44.293 --> 22:45.985
We've no choice, love.
He's got to be put down.

22:46.019 --> 22:49.298
No, you're not hurting him.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.266
You're not hurting my dog.

22:51.300 --> 22:52.405
Scruff!

22:52.440 --> 22:54.096
Jenny!

22:54.131 --> 22:55.960
Jenny, get yourself back here.

22:55.995 --> 22:58.204
Dad, Dad, don't bother.

22:58.238 --> 22:59.895
You'll never catch her.

22:59.930 --> 23:00.965
Girl's like a bloody whippet.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.415
[Helen] What happened?

23:02.450 --> 23:04.969
That hound of hers got in
with Benson's sheep.

23:05.004 --> 23:06.419
He's lost a lamb.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.834
He's not a dangerous dog.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.215
Young and over excited,

23:09.249 --> 23:11.700
but he doesn't have
a bad bone in him.

23:11.735 --> 23:13.944
Oh, aye, what do
you know about it?

23:13.978 --> 23:15.463
Dad.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.257
I do have some experience
with animals, Mr. Alderson.

23:17.292 --> 23:19.743
Yeah, well your animal
does something like that,

23:19.777 --> 23:21.607
hurts another man's stock,

23:21.641 --> 23:23.505
you should take
responsibility for it.

23:23.540 --> 23:25.438
It's not right to kill
a perfectly healthy animal.

23:25.473 --> 23:27.647
That's the way things
are done around here, son.

23:27.682 --> 23:32.480
Mind you, I don't expect
your type to understand that.

23:36.622 --> 23:37.968
He's upset.

23:38.002 --> 23:39.418
I can tell.

23:41.834 --> 23:43.560
You know the dog can be trained.

23:43.594 --> 23:45.285
It was just a mistake.

23:45.320 --> 23:48.530
Well, like Dad says,
this is the way things are done.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.467
I could go after her,
if you like.

23:54.502 --> 23:56.124
We could take my car.

23:57.988 --> 23:59.541
It's not the first time
she's run away.

23:59.576 --> 24:02.475
She always comes back,
eventually.

24:02.510 --> 24:04.063
All right.

24:04.097 --> 24:05.720
Well, you know
what's best for her.

24:05.754 --> 24:07.238
Yes.

24:08.964 --> 24:10.310
Bye, James.

24:12.589 --> 24:15.315
[light music]

24:35.922 --> 24:37.476
Jenny!

24:42.653 --> 24:46.139
Jump in, I'll give you a lift.

24:47.002 --> 24:48.176
[dog barking]

24:48.210 --> 24:51.248
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

24:54.700 --> 24:56.149
You do have one?

24:56.184 --> 24:58.704
Oh, fantastic.

24:58.738 --> 25:00.913
Yeah, I'll be there
first thing tomorrow.

25:00.947 --> 25:02.155
Thank you.

25:02.190 --> 25:04.157
Oh, sorry, one more thing.

25:04.192 --> 25:06.021
What colour is it?

25:06.539 --> 25:07.885
Mm, right.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.475
Uh, no, no, that'll
be fine, actually.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.719
Um, yep, tomorrow.

25:13.753 --> 25:15.410
I'll see you first thing.

25:16.549 --> 25:20.104
[Siegfried humming]

25:21.830 --> 25:24.937
[farcical music]

25:26.594 --> 25:28.941
-What are you doing?
-Doing? Nothing.

25:28.975 --> 25:30.736
Sounds about right, what's that?

25:30.770 --> 25:32.531
-What's what?
-That!

25:33.186 --> 25:34.740
-What, that?
-Yes.

25:34.774 --> 25:36.293
It's Mrs. Tompkins budgerigar.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.605
What's it doing here?

25:37.639 --> 25:39.296
I thought it needed
it's beak clipped.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.299
Yes, but I thought
I saw some mange,

25:42.333 --> 25:45.405
so I wanted to give him
a more thorough examination.

25:45.440 --> 25:46.648
Well, I'll have
a look if you like.

25:46.683 --> 25:48.063
No, don't!

25:48.995 --> 25:50.652
[clearing throat]

25:50.687 --> 25:52.585
You entrusted this case to me.

25:52.620 --> 25:55.864
For far too long now, I've
been shirking responsibility.

25:55.899 --> 25:58.660
Taking the easy way out,
but not any more.

25:59.281 --> 26:02.215
I'd really like to see
this one through myself.

26:03.631 --> 26:05.184
All right then.

26:06.530 --> 26:08.014
It's very quiet.

26:08.049 --> 26:10.465
The budgie. I haven't
heard a peep out of him.

26:10.499 --> 26:11.639
He's sleeping.

26:11.673 --> 26:12.778
Sleeping?

26:12.812 --> 26:14.573
Yeah.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.304
All right then.

26:28.345 --> 26:30.105
It's delicious, love.

26:30.140 --> 26:32.073
Just as mother cooked it.

26:32.107 --> 26:34.558
I burnt the onions
and I forgot leeks.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.077
As I said.

26:36.111 --> 26:38.251
You have to remember you only
got to eat your mother's meals

26:38.286 --> 26:40.599
when she spent years
perfecting 'em.

26:41.703 --> 26:43.187
I wish there were more for ya.

26:43.222 --> 26:46.535
Hey, never apologise
to me for that.

26:58.893 --> 27:00.273
[sighing]

27:00.308 --> 27:01.516
Hungry?

27:23.124 --> 27:24.953
How far did you go?

27:27.197 --> 27:31.304
Jenny, love, where's the dog?

27:32.478 --> 27:34.963
[light music]

27:42.419 --> 27:43.938
There you go.

27:43.972 --> 27:45.456
Good lad.

27:47.527 --> 27:50.185
[light music]

27:55.432 --> 27:58.366
[bells ringing]

28:01.990 --> 28:05.476
[bird chirping]

28:14.140 --> 28:16.039
He's not even the same colour.

28:16.073 --> 28:18.282
That's not going to
matter to Mrs. Tompkin.

28:18.317 --> 28:20.526
I don't know what's
more disappointing,

28:20.560 --> 28:22.908
the fact that you're
contemplating the thing

28:22.942 --> 28:25.013
or that I'm not even surprised.

28:25.048 --> 28:26.463
What's the problem?

28:26.497 --> 28:28.361
One budgie's not so
different from another.

28:28.396 --> 28:29.362
Herriot!

28:29.397 --> 28:30.916
[dog barking]

28:30.950 --> 28:32.262
I know what you're going to say.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.091
I wonder if you really do.

28:34.126 --> 28:36.507
We both know this is
not an aggressive dog.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.544
He can be trained
not to chase sheep.

28:38.578 --> 28:40.788
And the Aldersons have given
you permission to do this?

28:40.822 --> 28:41.789
Jenny has.

28:41.823 --> 28:43.100
Jenny?

28:43.549 --> 28:45.551
Oh, really, James. Have you
not done enough damage

28:45.585 --> 28:47.587
interfering in that
poor family's business?

28:48.968 --> 28:50.625
What does that mean?

28:54.215 --> 28:55.595
I want you to take this dog back

28:55.630 --> 28:57.494
to the Aldersons first
thing this morning.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.185
And if I don't?

28:59.220 --> 29:00.669
I think your time
away has led you

29:00.704 --> 29:02.775
to forget exactly who
it is you work for.

29:02.810 --> 29:05.226
I'm not entirely sure
that's possible, Siegfried.

29:05.260 --> 29:08.850
Take this dog back to
where it belongs, now!

29:10.093 --> 29:12.647
[light music]

29:16.237 --> 29:17.894
[sighs]

29:23.106 --> 29:25.039
[birds chirping]

29:25.556 --> 29:26.972
Good girl.

29:27.006 --> 29:29.284
That's it, Candy.

29:30.423 --> 29:32.322
Oh, good girl.

29:34.117 --> 29:36.844
[light music]

29:40.054 --> 29:41.710
Where are you off to?

29:41.745 --> 29:44.644
Dad wants me to get some
grain for the geese.

29:46.474 --> 29:48.994
[light music]

30:02.731 --> 30:04.423
[dog barking]

30:05.148 --> 30:06.597
Jim, hold on.

30:07.150 --> 30:09.497
I thought you could
do with the company.

30:18.678 --> 30:21.578
If you're lying to protect
the feelings of someone,

30:22.096 --> 30:23.822
is that really such a bad thing?

30:23.856 --> 30:24.823
Yes.

30:24.857 --> 30:26.100
How?

30:26.134 --> 30:27.584
If Miss Tompkin
knew Peter was dead,

30:27.618 --> 30:29.586
she'd be devastated, alone.

30:29.620 --> 30:30.794
Now she'll have company.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.485
But it's not her bird.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.004
You're not being honest.

30:34.039 --> 30:35.937
We don't all have to be
honest all of the time.

30:35.972 --> 30:38.250
Even you avoid the truth
when it suits.

30:38.284 --> 30:39.354
When?

30:39.389 --> 30:40.873
I assume we're
taking this one back

30:40.908 --> 30:42.875
to the Aldersons as agreed?

30:44.843 --> 30:46.499
This isn't going
to end well, Jim.

30:46.534 --> 30:47.811
Jenny loves that dog.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.226
It's not fair on either of them.

30:49.261 --> 30:50.710
Well, I hope that's
the real reason

30:50.745 --> 30:52.885
and not some misguided
attempt to win your way

30:52.920 --> 30:54.093
back into Helen's heart.

30:54.128 --> 30:55.370
Because if it is,
I'll tell you now.

30:55.405 --> 30:56.889
It's not.

30:58.684 --> 31:01.376
[light music]

31:09.660 --> 31:10.799
[dog barking]

31:10.834 --> 31:12.491
Hello, boy.

31:14.355 --> 31:16.391
Thanks again for this, James.

31:16.426 --> 31:18.186
-Hello, Trist.
-Hello.

31:19.774 --> 31:22.466
[light music]

31:24.468 --> 31:25.676
How's your sister?

31:25.711 --> 31:28.231
Haven't seen much of
her since the wedding.

31:28.265 --> 31:30.233
She's been going
on lots of walks.

31:30.267 --> 31:31.993
I think she feels guilty.

31:32.649 --> 31:34.064
You know, he's in France.

31:34.099 --> 31:35.928
I did, I do.

31:35.963 --> 31:37.447
He writes to her.

31:37.481 --> 31:38.931
A snuck a look once.

31:38.966 --> 31:41.175
I don't think you should
be doing that, Jenny.

31:41.209 --> 31:42.624
He still loves her.

31:42.659 --> 31:44.385
Keeps banging on
about how much it hurt

31:44.419 --> 31:47.664
when she called it off and
can he have another chance.

31:47.698 --> 31:50.839
But don't worry, she doesn't
write him back or anything.

31:50.874 --> 31:53.463
Worry? Why would I worry?

31:53.497 --> 31:56.293
You know, I was listening
by the door when she did it.

31:56.328 --> 31:58.054
You really shouldn't
have done that.

31:58.088 --> 31:59.572
Absolutely.

31:59.607 --> 32:02.437
And we absolutely do not
want to hear what was said.

32:02.472 --> 32:04.888
-Do we, Jim?
-Absolutely not.

32:07.166 --> 32:08.581
Ah, what's the harm?

32:08.616 --> 32:11.377
Helen said, it's not
that she didn't love him,

32:11.412 --> 32:12.620
because she did.

32:12.654 --> 32:14.725
But not in that way.
And he didn't understand.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.211
And I don't blame him, 'cos
I didn't understand either.

32:17.245 --> 32:20.386
I thought he were gonna cry,
but she wouldn't budge

32:20.421 --> 32:23.079
and said it was better
for both of them.

32:23.113 --> 32:25.081
Then Hugh got really cross

32:25.115 --> 32:27.980
and asked her if she
was only calling it off

32:28.015 --> 32:30.534
because she liked someone else.

32:38.094 --> 32:42.167
And um, did you happen
to hear what she said?

32:42.201 --> 32:43.996
Thought you said I shouldn't
be telling you all this?

32:44.031 --> 32:47.379
No, you're right. You shouldn't.

32:49.622 --> 32:51.003
But I have no such
moral compunction.

32:51.038 --> 32:53.178
Come on, Jenny, spill the beans.

32:53.212 --> 32:55.318
Dad dragged me away before
I could hear her owt.

32:55.352 --> 32:58.183
Give us a clip around
the ear for me troubles, too.

33:00.702 --> 33:03.464
[light music]

33:05.673 --> 33:07.330
Mrs. Hall!

33:08.089 --> 33:09.573
Mrs. Hall!

33:10.816 --> 33:13.508
It doesn't matter, found it.

33:14.337 --> 33:15.717
Whenever you want
to waste me time,

33:15.752 --> 33:17.512
feel free to holler.

33:17.547 --> 33:19.307
Matches.

33:19.342 --> 33:20.239
Oh.

33:22.069 --> 33:24.416
You weren't supposed
to see that.

33:26.487 --> 33:28.592
Did you know about this?

33:29.593 --> 33:31.181
Mrs. Hall?

33:32.941 --> 33:34.012
Mrs. Hall!

33:34.046 --> 33:35.772
Well, far be it for me to reveal

33:35.806 --> 33:39.396
the underhand goings on
in this establishment.

33:39.431 --> 33:43.607
Mrs. Hall, why on earth
is there a dead budgie?

33:43.642 --> 33:46.093
[bird chirping]

33:47.163 --> 33:48.578
No.

33:49.268 --> 33:51.029
I should have known
better than to trust him.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.031
And why might that be?

33:53.065 --> 33:54.618
If you have a point, Mrs. Hall,

33:54.653 --> 33:56.275
I'd rather you got on
and stabbed me with it.

33:56.310 --> 33:58.553
I had a very strange
phone call this morning.

33:58.588 --> 34:00.245
Given our clientele,
I can't imagine

34:00.279 --> 34:01.798
that's a unique occurrence.

34:01.832 --> 34:04.214
It were the dean of
Edinburgh Veterinary College.

34:04.249 --> 34:05.560
Ah.

34:05.595 --> 34:07.528
They wanted to know if
Tristan would be returning

34:07.562 --> 34:08.943
for the autumn term.

34:08.977 --> 34:11.256
I told them, they must
have made a mistake

34:11.290 --> 34:14.086
because Tristan passed
his exams last Christmas.

34:14.121 --> 34:16.675
Where was that, um,
thing I was after?

34:16.709 --> 34:18.815
Siegfried Donald Farnon!

34:18.849 --> 34:20.265
I've no doubt there's
a very simple,

34:20.299 --> 34:21.956
logical explanation
for all of this.

34:21.990 --> 34:24.096
You told him he passed his exams
when he blooming well didn't.

34:24.131 --> 34:26.719
One really mustn't leap
to outlandish conclusions.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.619
-All right, I did it.
-You lied to him.

34:29.653 --> 34:31.517
It was for his own good.

34:31.552 --> 34:34.348
What would the blasted
university call him for anyway?

34:34.382 --> 34:36.315
-Well, they didn't.
-What?

34:36.350 --> 34:38.006
I knew you were up to something.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.215
I knew you wouldn't
tell me the truth.

34:39.249 --> 34:40.250
Mrs. Hall, I'm shocked.

34:40.285 --> 34:41.734
A woman of your integrity.

34:41.769 --> 34:43.150
Don't even start.

34:43.184 --> 34:44.875
What is it the seventh
commandment tells us?

34:44.910 --> 34:46.325
Thou shalt not commit adultery.

34:46.360 --> 34:48.638
-Well, the other one then.
-What were you thinking?

34:48.672 --> 34:50.191
That it might be nice
if I wasn't constantly

34:50.226 --> 34:53.056
hounding him about
passing his damned exams.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.403
I thought we might be
able to salvage something

34:55.438 --> 34:58.130
that approximates
to a relationship.

34:58.165 --> 34:59.718
Oh, for goodness sake.

35:00.581 --> 35:02.169
You're both as
bad as each other.

35:02.203 --> 35:04.481
What's that supposed to mean?

35:05.482 --> 35:07.070
Mrs. Hall!

35:11.039 --> 35:13.456
[chirping]

35:15.768 --> 35:18.185
[sheep panting]

35:29.644 --> 35:31.646
-[Rob] All right there, Jim.
-Rob.

35:31.681 --> 35:33.407
Morning, Mr. Benson.

35:33.441 --> 35:35.167
Scruff's my dog.

35:35.202 --> 35:37.583
I wanna say I'm sorry
you lost your lamb.

35:37.618 --> 35:40.655
Well, it's big of ya to
come say so yourself.

35:40.690 --> 35:42.001
How's the mother?

35:42.036 --> 35:43.589
Not too clever.

35:44.072 --> 35:46.247
She won't get up,
won't feed or drink.

35:46.282 --> 35:48.560
That can happen
after a stillbirth.

35:48.594 --> 35:51.149
What she really needs
is a lamb to look after.

35:51.183 --> 35:52.909
How about that little
orphan you had?

35:52.943 --> 35:54.255
Hubert?

35:54.290 --> 35:55.360
Herbert.

35:56.395 --> 35:58.121
Well, it's worth
a go, I suppose.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.536
[whimpering dog]

35:59.571 --> 36:02.505
What the bloody hell's
that thing doing up here.

36:02.539 --> 36:04.127
I know this dog
is the last thing

36:04.162 --> 36:05.266
you want to see right now.

36:05.301 --> 36:07.026
But he didn't attack your flock.

36:07.061 --> 36:08.407
You saw that yourself.

36:08.442 --> 36:10.306
I still lost one of
my lambs all the same.

36:10.340 --> 36:13.032
Because he's not been trained
how to behave around sheep.

36:13.067 --> 36:14.586
He just got over excited.

36:14.620 --> 36:18.003
I don't see that as reason
enough to put him down.

36:18.590 --> 36:20.419
What if he comes back
and it happens again?

36:20.454 --> 36:22.732
We'll train him so he doesn't.

36:22.766 --> 36:26.011
With your permission,
I'd certainly like to try.

36:26.045 --> 36:27.909
[dog barking]

36:29.877 --> 36:32.569
[light music]

36:44.063 --> 36:45.513
Jenny!

36:48.965 --> 36:50.380
Jenny!

36:57.111 --> 36:58.768
They're hoggs,
so that means that--

36:58.802 --> 37:01.391
They're too young to have babies
and won't have lambs in them.

37:01.426 --> 37:03.842
It won't do them any harm if
they get a little startled.

37:03.876 --> 37:05.775
Now you need to hold him tight.

37:05.809 --> 37:07.225
Keep him close to your side.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.572
The moment he growls or
barks you pull him back.

37:09.606 --> 37:12.022
Tell him to stop, sit.

37:12.057 --> 37:14.301
Pull him back, stop, sit.

37:14.335 --> 37:15.819
And be firm.

37:15.854 --> 37:18.650
If he obeys your command,
give him a treat.

37:18.684 --> 37:20.893
-Tristan.
-Mm?

37:20.928 --> 37:23.689
Oh, sorry Jenny.
I was feeling a bit peckish.

37:23.724 --> 37:26.623
Come on, Scruff, that's it.

37:26.658 --> 37:28.246
Come on.

37:28.970 --> 37:30.627
That's it. Be good, Scruff.

37:30.662 --> 37:32.595
Do you really think
this is going to work?

37:32.629 --> 37:33.975
I hope so.

37:34.735 --> 37:36.184
And if it doesn't?

37:37.358 --> 37:38.842
-[dog barking]
-Scruff, stop!

37:38.877 --> 37:41.431
Stop it, Scruff.
Scruff no, stop.

37:41.466 --> 37:43.019
Stop! Scruff.

37:43.053 --> 37:44.572
[barking]

37:45.780 --> 37:48.024
-Stop!
-It's all right, Jenny.

37:48.058 --> 37:49.543
I've got him.

37:49.577 --> 37:51.269
Come on.

37:51.303 --> 37:53.305
Let's take him out for a minute.
Give him a moment to calm down.

37:53.340 --> 37:54.824
Why won't he stop barking?

37:54.858 --> 37:57.205
Don't worry, we'll try again.

37:57.240 --> 37:59.967
You need to stop,
Scruff, please.

38:00.830 --> 38:03.142
-Why won't he stop, James?
-He can still see the sheep.

38:03.177 --> 38:06.801
Here, walk him away and keep
talking to him, all right?

38:06.836 --> 38:08.286
Come on, Scruff.

38:08.320 --> 38:11.047
That's it, come on. Come on.

38:11.081 --> 38:13.152
[dog barking]

38:13.187 --> 38:15.672
Come on, Scruff, come on.

38:18.606 --> 38:20.056
What'd ya think?

38:20.090 --> 38:22.127
I really don't know.

38:24.819 --> 38:28.478
[farcical music]

38:41.733 --> 38:43.079
[bell ringing]

38:43.113 --> 38:45.150
I've got it!

38:48.567 --> 38:51.639
Mrs. Tompkin,
how lovely to see ya.

38:54.780 --> 38:57.231
Let me help you inside.

39:02.581 --> 39:04.549
Now you set yourself down there.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.516
Oh, don't worry.

39:06.551 --> 39:08.346
I can find my way.

39:09.139 --> 39:11.038
I'll fetch Mr. Farnon.

39:14.179 --> 39:16.423
Oh, here he is now.

39:18.425 --> 39:21.013
Mrs. Tompkin, what
an absolute pleasure.

39:21.048 --> 39:22.705
I know young Mr. Farnon said

39:22.739 --> 39:25.432
he'd bring my Peter
back this afternoon,

39:25.466 --> 39:27.813
but I couldn't wait.

39:28.262 --> 39:29.988
My boy don't come back to see

39:30.022 --> 39:32.784
his old mum as much as I'd like.

39:32.818 --> 39:36.546
It's hard, isn't it, when
children grow up and leave home?

39:36.581 --> 39:38.445
Well, it might silly to you,

39:38.479 --> 39:41.758
but hearing his
fluttering around

39:41.793 --> 39:45.866
and pecking at his cage,
it warms my heart

39:45.900 --> 39:47.592
knowing he's there.

39:47.626 --> 39:49.835
That doesn't sound silly at all.

39:49.870 --> 39:52.079
[chirping bird]

39:52.113 --> 39:53.114
What was that?

39:53.149 --> 39:54.530
[bird chirping]

39:54.564 --> 39:56.290
Is that?

39:56.324 --> 39:59.327
Well, that's not my Peter.

39:59.362 --> 40:01.778
Mrs. Hall, I believe
Tristan spoke

40:01.813 --> 40:03.987
to you about this matter.

40:04.436 --> 40:05.610
Well.

40:07.301 --> 40:08.198
Yes.

40:08.820 --> 40:10.580
Mrs. Tompkin.

40:13.341 --> 40:16.828
It is Peter, and he's already
for you to take him home.

40:16.862 --> 40:19.900
Oh, my goodness, thank you.

40:20.625 --> 40:23.593
But he never used
to be able to cheep.

40:24.663 --> 40:25.906
Um...

40:25.940 --> 40:27.494
Well...

40:27.528 --> 40:29.047
The thing is.

40:29.806 --> 40:32.395
Peter needed his beak trimmed

40:32.430 --> 40:35.467
and now that he has,
it's allowed him

40:35.502 --> 40:37.158
to find his voice again.

40:37.193 --> 40:40.230
Oh, how wonderful!

40:40.645 --> 40:43.233
He's like a different bird.

40:43.958 --> 40:46.789
Oh, thank you both so much.

40:46.823 --> 40:50.931
And say a big thank you
to that brother of yours.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.831
Let me help you out.

40:54.866 --> 40:57.109
Oh, I can manage.

40:57.144 --> 41:02.390
Once I've walked it once,
it's no bother doing so again.

41:02.425 --> 41:04.427
I'll bring Peter home
to you, Mrs. Tompkin.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.394
Thank you.

41:15.127 --> 41:17.267
And as far as his exams go,

41:17.302 --> 41:19.580
Tristan can never
find out the truth.

41:19.615 --> 41:20.616
Understood.

41:20.650 --> 41:22.031
You can't keep him hidden

41:22.065 --> 41:23.619
in that dispensary
cupboard, either.

41:23.653 --> 41:25.448
He needs to get
out and start doing

41:25.483 --> 41:26.725
some proper work.

41:26.760 --> 41:29.383
I'm sure I can fill any
gaps in his knowledge.

41:29.417 --> 41:31.799
And when his birthday comes,

41:31.834 --> 41:33.870
he's getting that bag.

41:34.906 --> 41:37.598
[light music]

41:40.739 --> 41:43.466
Let's see if you can't
keep each other company.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.881
Afternoon, Rob.

41:44.916 --> 41:46.987
I thought I'd drop
a few things round.

41:47.021 --> 41:48.713
Least we could do, considering.

41:48.747 --> 41:50.197
Oh, there's really no need.

41:50.231 --> 41:52.924
There is and we're sorry.

41:53.545 --> 41:54.960
Have you seen our Jenny?

41:54.995 --> 41:56.375
She took off this morning.

41:56.410 --> 41:57.825
We've not seen hide
nor hair of her since.

41:57.860 --> 42:00.518
Aye, she's in top
field with veterinary.

42:06.627 --> 42:08.526
Leave them be, Scruff.

42:12.357 --> 42:13.496
Trist.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.808
-Afternoon, Helen.
-Don't afternoon me.

42:14.842 --> 42:16.568
Look, none of this is my doing.

42:17.189 --> 42:19.847
He's only doing what
he thinks is right.

42:19.882 --> 42:21.608
It's all he ever does.

42:22.022 --> 42:23.989
Even if it's not easy.

42:25.094 --> 42:27.441
I'm sure that's something
you could relate to.

42:29.788 --> 42:31.549
It's good to see
you again, Helen.

42:33.205 --> 42:34.241
You too.

42:37.140 --> 42:39.108
Keep encouraging him.

42:39.142 --> 42:41.593
Leave them be, Scruff, leave.

42:42.629 --> 42:44.423
That's it, give him a treat.

42:45.632 --> 42:47.254
All right.

42:47.288 --> 42:49.877
Now you can try
letting go of the lead.

42:51.430 --> 42:53.087
Be good, Scruff.

42:53.122 --> 42:54.606
Please, be good.

42:58.127 --> 42:59.577
He's doing it, James!

42:59.611 --> 43:01.509
He's really doing it!

43:01.544 --> 43:03.097
Good lad, Scruff!

43:03.822 --> 43:07.515
-There you go!
-He's not even looking at 'em.

43:08.171 --> 43:09.621
Helen, we've just been--

43:09.656 --> 43:10.967
Jenny, get back up to the house.

43:11.002 --> 43:12.555
-But.
-Now please, Jenny.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.557
Sorry, I maybe should
have spoken to you--

43:14.592 --> 43:15.593
Maybe?

43:15.627 --> 43:17.905
There's no maybe about it.

43:18.803 --> 43:20.563
I know I'm not from around here

43:20.598 --> 43:22.220
and I might not understand
the way things are done.

43:22.254 --> 43:24.981
But I know the difference
between right and wrong.

43:25.016 --> 43:28.433
Killing a perfectly good
animal can never be right.

43:28.467 --> 43:31.436
It's not your dog
or your reputation.

43:31.470 --> 43:32.886
It was a mistake.

43:32.920 --> 43:35.095
Animals mess up sometimes.

43:35.129 --> 43:36.614
Just like people do.

43:37.200 --> 43:38.823
There's no reason for you

43:38.857 --> 43:40.859
to keep punishing
yourself for anything.

43:44.276 --> 43:46.037
What am I supposed to do?

43:46.071 --> 43:48.108
Carry on as if
nothing's happened?

43:48.142 --> 43:50.075
What's the alternative?

43:50.110 --> 43:51.698
The dog didn't do
anything wrong.

43:51.732 --> 43:53.561
He deserves a second chance.

43:54.597 --> 43:57.393
I think you both
deserve a second chance.

44:00.258 --> 44:02.053
I should get Jenny back.

44:06.713 --> 44:08.266
I've missed you.

44:12.063 --> 44:14.134
Missed you, too.

44:14.721 --> 44:17.344
[light music]

44:36.604 --> 44:38.676
There you go, little one.

44:40.436 --> 44:42.541
[light music]

44:50.342 --> 44:52.448
We've worked hard with Scruff.

44:52.482 --> 44:54.243
He's not going to
scare any more sheep.

44:54.277 --> 44:56.210
He's good now, Mr. Benson.

44:56.245 --> 44:59.835
And I'm gonna make sure he
never goes off again, anyways.

44:59.869 --> 45:02.976
All the same,
if you say he needs...

45:05.944 --> 45:07.290
You know.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.366
Nay, you carry on, lass.

45:15.436 --> 45:18.094
I reckon some good came
out of it after all.

45:19.924 --> 45:22.478
[light music]

45:32.626 --> 45:34.766
What do ya think Dad will say?

45:34.801 --> 45:38.218
Oh he'll huff and puff and
eventually blow himself out.

45:38.252 --> 45:41.083
And you won't let him
do anything to Scruff?

45:41.117 --> 45:43.948
Well, now he's been trained,
there's no need to.

45:43.982 --> 45:46.019
Don't worry,
I'll take care of it.

45:46.813 --> 45:48.884
It's not James' fault, you know?

45:48.918 --> 45:50.402
He wanted to take me home

45:50.437 --> 45:52.232
but I said I wouldn't
go unless he helped me.

45:52.266 --> 45:54.613
I'm not sure it was fair to
put him in that position.

45:54.648 --> 45:56.374
I don't think he minded.

45:56.892 --> 45:58.997
It gave me and him
a chance to talk.

46:00.412 --> 46:03.036
[light music]

46:10.768 --> 46:13.736
And what have you and
James got to talk about?

46:13.771 --> 46:15.565
You know, stuff.

46:17.533 --> 46:19.328
Aren't you interested?

46:19.362 --> 46:20.501
In what?

46:20.536 --> 46:22.227
In what we spoke about.

46:22.262 --> 46:24.333
Why would I be interested?

46:24.367 --> 46:26.128
Just thought you might be.

46:27.129 --> 46:29.062
Well, I'm not.

46:29.752 --> 46:31.271
He is great, though.

46:31.305 --> 46:34.515
Not a lot of blokes who stick
their neck out like that.

46:34.550 --> 46:36.172
He's got a good heart.

46:36.207 --> 46:38.657
-He's not bad looking, either.
-Jenny!

46:38.692 --> 46:40.349
I'm just saying.

46:40.383 --> 46:42.454
Yeah, well, you're too young
to be thinking about his looks.

46:42.489 --> 46:44.629
Good or otherwise.

46:45.768 --> 46:47.666
I am right though, aren't I?

46:48.219 --> 46:51.360
You're not wrong,
I'll give you that.

46:51.394 --> 46:53.120
[light music]

46:53.155 --> 46:55.467
-Good evening, James.
-Good evening.

46:57.607 --> 46:59.989
[light music]

47:05.546 --> 47:08.480
[bleating sheep]

47:19.422 --> 47:20.596
Here we go.

47:23.219 --> 47:25.843
Mm, I'll get you
one back next time.

47:29.018 --> 47:31.469
It was only a couple
weeks I was away.

47:31.503 --> 47:34.299
You forget how
beautiful this place is.

47:35.507 --> 47:37.061
There you are.

47:38.476 --> 47:41.134
I called in on Richard
Alderson this afternoon.

47:41.168 --> 47:42.894
Before you start, Rob
Benson agreed to it.

47:42.929 --> 47:45.138
I don't care if it was
sanctioned by the bloody Pope.

47:45.172 --> 47:46.208
I distinctly remember
telling you--

47:46.242 --> 47:47.485
You don't always have to live

47:47.519 --> 47:50.212
by the old rules on
how to do things.

47:50.246 --> 47:52.317
We can make some of our own.

47:52.352 --> 47:54.906
You made me a senior
vet because you thought

47:54.941 --> 47:57.391
I could add something
to the practice.

47:57.426 --> 48:00.187
I think you should start
trusting me to do that.

48:03.052 --> 48:04.640
Quite right.

48:04.674 --> 48:06.400
It's about time you started
ploughing your own furrow.

48:06.435 --> 48:08.092
[chuckling]

48:08.126 --> 48:10.473
Tell the truth, you
missed him, didn't you?

48:10.508 --> 48:12.717
-[Siegfried] As for you.
-Oh God, here it comes.

48:12.751 --> 48:14.892
Mrs. Tompkin popped in earlier.

48:15.685 --> 48:19.206
She was very happy to
be reunited with Peter.

48:20.932 --> 48:22.244
Was she?

48:24.763 --> 48:27.697
Well good, excellent.
I mean, why shouldn't she be?

48:27.732 --> 48:29.320
So thanks to James' good idea,

48:29.354 --> 48:30.977
we can look forward to you doing

48:31.011 --> 48:33.393
a lot more work
around the place.

48:33.427 --> 48:35.188
Under my expert tutelage,
obviously.

48:35.222 --> 48:37.466
Obviously. Eh, oh!

48:38.087 --> 48:40.848
Come on, mustn't keep
Mrs. Hall waiting.

48:41.297 --> 48:42.574
I think she wants to make sure

48:42.609 --> 48:44.507
you never dream of
going away again.

48:49.719 --> 48:52.722
[light music]

48:52.757 --> 48:53.896
Ah!

48:55.518 --> 48:58.280
[light music]

49:02.940 --> 49:04.700
Just a light meal tonight.

49:04.734 --> 49:06.736
There's no need to
drown the damn thing.

49:06.771 --> 49:08.117
It's dead already.

49:08.152 --> 49:09.739
I like to mop it up with
my Yorkshire pudding.

49:09.774 --> 49:11.327
Mop it up?

49:11.362 --> 49:13.605
This is the dinner table,
not some backstreet kitchen.

49:14.399 --> 49:15.538
Oh!

49:16.056 --> 49:17.540
There's plenty more in the pan.

49:17.575 --> 49:18.956
Mm.

49:19.784 --> 49:20.992
All right?

49:22.131 --> 49:23.995
It looks tremendous.

49:24.030 --> 49:26.480
Remember, it's not
the mountain we conquer.

49:26.515 --> 49:28.862
[Together] But ourselves!

49:29.828 --> 49:31.658
[Mrs. Hall] Welcome back, James.

49:31.692 --> 49:33.901
[Siegfried] Welcome back.

49:34.730 --> 49:38.078
[light music]
