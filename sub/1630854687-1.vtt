Mm...

00:44.002 --> 00:45.211
best alarm clock ever.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.839
Mm, that smells so good.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.466
You were smiling in your sleep.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.344
What were you dreaming about?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.890
I dreamed that I married
a handsome prince,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.641
and he woke me up with roses,

00:58.641 --> 01:01.061
and we lived in
the most lovely, old castle.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.354
And did this handsome prince

01:02.354 --> 01:04.689
make you a mushroom omelette
for breakfast?

01:04.689 --> 01:06.441
I don't know, did he?

01:06.441 --> 01:07.942
He tried.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.277
Aw, what dream
gets better than that?

01:09.277 --> 01:11.196
Well, he could be
a better cook,

01:11.196 --> 01:12.364
but he had good intentions.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.783
Well, if he had
an updated kitchen,

01:14.783 --> 01:16.076
and by updated,

01:16.076 --> 01:17.494
I mean something
from this century...

01:17.494 --> 01:18.578
Yes,

01:18.578 --> 01:20.663
well the, uh,

01:20.663 --> 01:22.665
the house whisperer is coming by
to give us an estimate.

01:22.665 --> 01:25.418
That's what my mother calls
the contractor she recommended.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.379
Mm, you know what?
He was in my dream.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.422
Yes, he had
a built-in refrigerator,

01:29.422 --> 01:31.257
a double oven,
and a six-burner stove.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.927
So, did you leave
the handsome prince for him?

01:33.927 --> 01:35.637
Well, what can I say?

01:35.637 --> 01:36.596
He had me at refrigerator.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.766
I don't like this story.

01:42.852 --> 01:44.562
So, Sam, what do you think?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.981
Well, I've got some good news
and bad news.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.400
Okay, let's start
with the good news.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.235
Okay, I gotta check
with my guys,

01:50.235 --> 01:51.319
but I think we have an opening.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.404
Great.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.489
Okay, now the bad news.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.117
This house
has some serious quirks.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.576
Like, really serious.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.953
Such as...?

01:59.953 --> 02:01.287
You'll have to bring

02:01.287 --> 02:02.247
the plumbing
and the electrical up to code...

02:02.247 --> 02:02.914
Oh, that's no big deal.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.249
Isn't it?

02:04.249 --> 02:05.792
...and you may have
a drainage problem.

02:05.792 --> 02:06.668
We can totally fix that.

02:08.795 --> 02:09.879
Ah, sorry Sam.
Just one second.

02:09.879 --> 02:10.922
Well, can't--

02:12.257 --> 02:13.717
- Oh, and one more thing...
- Mm?

02:13.717 --> 02:16.344
I'm having some real concerns
about this roof.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.307
- Hi!
- Grace, hi!

02:21.307 --> 02:23.143
You know what?
Your timing is so perfect.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.185
Sam's actually here right now.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.895
Oh, isn't he wonderful?

02:25.895 --> 02:27.439
Oh, he is very thorough,

02:27.439 --> 02:28.648
but he thinks there are a lot
of problems with the house.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.649
Come in.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.903
 Buying as is
is always a little bit risky,

02:33.903 --> 02:35.155
but it's got so much potential.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.531
♪ I think it's worth it ♪

02:37.907 --> 02:40.577
And Sam is simply the best.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.328
Well, thank you kindly, Mrs. H.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.248
Well, I've got to get
to my next appointment,

02:45.248 --> 02:47.250
so, uh, I'll send you guys
an estimate.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.793
Thank you so much.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.212
Thanks for all the good news.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.257
Whatever the estimate,
you couldn't be in better hands.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.344
You know, my visit here
overlapping Sam was no accident.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.346
Yeah, I'm getting it.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.181
You know,
I was an interior designer

03:01.181 --> 03:03.016
before I got married,

03:03.016 --> 03:04.392
so I was thinking
I might be of some use.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.479
Well, we would absolutely
love your help

03:07.479 --> 03:08.730
in turning this house
into a home.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.360
You married very well.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.363
So I've been told.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.464
You're here!

03:35.757 --> 03:36.758
This is amazing!

03:39.177 --> 03:41.513
Together again at last!

03:41.513 --> 03:44.015
Three grown-up, married ladies.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.433
All thanks to the veil.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.560
But one of us
has a grown-up, fancy house.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.562
It has so much history.
You guys are gonna love it.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.730
Come in,
I want to show you everything.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.107
- Oh, sure!
- Come on!

03:52.107 --> 03:53.733
I'm so glad you're here.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.781
See? I told you
I wasn't going to forget it.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.366
Well, it's going to be
the main attraction

04:01.366 --> 04:03.284
at my lace exhibit
at the museum.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.869
It just never loses
its charm for me.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.914
I brought something else
for your exhibit.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.378
The Christening gown
from Ariana's trunk!

04:13.378 --> 04:14.838
- Oh!
- You guys...

04:14.838 --> 04:16.256
Oh, no, no.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.258
We're not going down
that road again.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.968
There's no legend
attached to this.

04:19.968 --> 04:21.261
It's just timely.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.763
Paolo's grandmother
sent it to me.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.765
Pretty sure it was
a not-so-subtle hint.

04:28.601 --> 04:31.187
Oh, no, don't be alarmed.
It's just the house.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.981
I mean, it's over
a hundred years old.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.357
It's very expressive.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.192
I think it's just saying
it's happy you're here.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.861
I had a brownstone
that made noise like that,

04:37.861 --> 04:38.695
so I broke up with it.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.031
Come on!

04:43.491 --> 04:45.076
Do you realize
it's been over a year

04:45.076 --> 04:46.536
since the three of us
were together?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.954
Since my wedding, right?

04:47.954 --> 04:49.122
Wait, how is Nick?

04:49.122 --> 04:50.290
Oh, he's great.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.583
Super busy,
running two restaurants,

04:51.583 --> 04:53.877
and me running
the auction house...

04:53.877 --> 04:55.295
No, we have not figured out

04:55.295 --> 04:56.463
when we're going
to have a honeymoon.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.715
It's hard balancing
marriage and career.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.091
All of us--
we're all so busy.

05:00.091 --> 05:01.176
Oh, yeah.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.385
I know. I'm just so happy

05:02.385 --> 05:03.470
we were finally able
to get together.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.929
We should definitely
toast to that.

05:04.929 --> 05:06.348
Oh! Excuse me?

05:06.348 --> 05:08.391
Can we have three glasses
of the rosé, please?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.642
Ah, you know what?

05:09.642 --> 05:10.727
I'm just gonna stick with water. Thanks.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.066
Well, I'm driving, you know,
so I-- I should just--

05:16.066 --> 05:17.108
I should drink water.

05:19.694 --> 05:20.820
Ahem.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.656
Is there any chance

05:23.656 --> 05:27.452
that our designated driver
could be pregnant?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.536
Blink twice for yes!

05:28.536 --> 05:29.662
Maybe.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.247
Wait! Maybe?

05:31.247 --> 05:32.499
Did she say maybe?

05:32.499 --> 05:34.542
That was not
what I was expecting.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.502
What?

05:35.502 --> 05:37.337
Okay, a few months ago,

05:37.337 --> 05:40.006
I did have
a positive home pregnancy test.

05:40.006 --> 05:40.882
Peter and I were so excited,

05:40.882 --> 05:42.050
but...

05:42.050 --> 05:43.301
I went to the doctor,

05:43.301 --> 05:45.011
and, unfortunately,
I wasn't pregnant.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.682
They said the tests
are 99% accurate,

05:48.682 --> 05:49.808
and I was...

05:49.808 --> 05:50.934
the one percent.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.645
Oh, Avery, I'm so sorry.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.979
Thank you.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.189
It was--

05:56.189 --> 05:58.525
It was really hard,

05:58.525 --> 06:00.610
but this time,
I really think I'm pregnant.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.070
Don't-- Don't say anything.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.530
I don't want to tell Peter yet

06:03.530 --> 06:05.865
until I go to the doctor
and we know for sure, you know?

06:05.865 --> 06:07.075
'Cause I don't want to put him
on that rollercoaster again.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.536
Oh, my goodness,

06:09.536 --> 06:11.037
you guys are the first people
I've told.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.039
Don't say anything to anyone
until I know for sure, okay?

06:13.039 --> 06:13.998
Of course.
Not a word.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.041
Except for these three--

06:15.041 --> 06:16.042
"We love you."

06:16.042 --> 06:17.377
Yes, we love you so much.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.212
I love you.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.505
Being a mom
would mean the world to me.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.048
You are gonna be a great mom,

06:22.048 --> 06:24.259
and that kid is gonna be
the luckiest kid in the world!

06:24.259 --> 06:26.511
Only next to yours and Emma's.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.888
Ah, Paolo and I
aren't there quite yet.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.349
And I was willing
to go along with you both

06:31.349 --> 06:32.767
with the veil,

06:32.767 --> 06:34.728
but no, you can leave me out
of the Christening gown.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.854
Oh?

06:35.854 --> 06:36.938
Well, maybe I'll take it
for a test drive.

06:38.314 --> 06:39.649
I just don't think
I'm the mothering type.

06:39.649 --> 06:42.110
I don't think you know yourself
as well as we do.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.238
Well, maybe you're right.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.909
- I love you.
- I love you.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.748
Thank you guys
for bringing the veil,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.124
and the christening gown...

06:56.124 --> 06:57.542
and just thank you
for being you.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.502
One night is not nearly enough.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.629
Next time, we get
the whole weekend, okay?

07:01.629 --> 07:04.174
This does not count
as our annual antiquing trip.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.175
You know what I was thinking?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.092
Let's go to New Orleans next!

07:06.092 --> 07:07.302
Yeah, I love that idea.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.345
Okay, I love this conversation,

07:08.345 --> 07:09.679
but I don't like long goodbyes,

07:09.679 --> 07:10.847
and we have to get
to the airport, so...

07:10.847 --> 07:11.765
Oh, no, no!

07:11.765 --> 07:13.141
We forgot to take our selfie.

07:13.141 --> 07:14.267
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come in.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.894
One... two...

07:15.894 --> 07:17.354
Everyone say...

07:17.354 --> 07:18.938
Boston!
One, two...

07:18.938 --> 07:20.148
No...

07:20.148 --> 07:22.150
Everyone say "baby".

07:22.150 --> 07:23.485
- Aw, okay.
- Okay.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.236
One, two, three...

07:25.236 --> 07:26.154
"Baby!"

07:26.154 --> 07:27.697
Aw!

07:27.697 --> 07:29.699
Aw, that's a good one.
I love you.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.368
- I love you, too.
- Okay, come on!

07:31.368 --> 07:33.286
Please, call us
as soon as you know.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.162
- I will.
- Okay.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.997
- I will!
- Okay.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.207
Bye!

07:45.507 --> 07:47.592
So, the French lace
will hang here on this wall,

07:47.592 --> 07:48.718
and then I'm thinking

07:48.718 --> 07:51.054
the Italian pieces
can go here...

07:51.054 --> 07:53.515
and then the veil will sit
right here by the painting.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.518
I wish Sonya
was here to see this.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.186
Well, she got
such a great job at the Getty,

07:58.186 --> 07:59.396
we can't blame her for leaving.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.605
I know.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.524
The new guy starts on Monday.

08:02.524 --> 08:03.817
What's he like?

08:03.817 --> 08:07.028
He's not very warm
or fuzzy on the phone...

08:07.028 --> 08:09.030
Well, the Board's
thrilled to have him.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.198
They think Mason Sylvester

08:10.198 --> 08:11.866
can breathe new life
into the Stanbridge.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.369
Well, I think the Stanbridge
is breathing perfectly well.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.495
Make it more relevant,

08:15.495 --> 08:16.913
boost attendance...

08:16.913 --> 08:19.040
The Board is always
singing the same tune.

08:19.040 --> 08:20.333
Mm, you're on the Board.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.251
What tune were you singing?

08:21.251 --> 08:22.669
I'm singing whatever tune

08:22.669 --> 08:23.962
my lovely wife
would like me to sing.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.046
Very good answer.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.551
He's big in New York.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.885
He's got access
to high-profile artists.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.680
I know you were close
with Sonya,

08:33.680 --> 08:35.557
but I think
you should give him a chance.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.144
Well, I hope he likes lace.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.270
Who doesn't love lace?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.529
<i>Dr. Hawthorne's office.</i>

08:49.529 --> 08:50.697
- Hi...
- Hi!

08:50.697 --> 08:51.698
Hi!

08:53.616 --> 08:54.743
- Hi.
- Hi!

08:54.743 --> 08:56.036
I thought you were
in a Board meeting?

08:56.036 --> 08:57.954
Well, yeah,
but I had to duck out early.

08:57.954 --> 08:58.913
I'm gonna go teach
a class, remember?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.081
Oh, okay.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.250
You okay?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.793
Me?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.170
Yeah, no, I'm good.
Yeah, yeah, everything's great.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.505
You just seem...

09:07.505 --> 09:08.673
you know...

09:08.673 --> 09:09.841
Sorry, I'm fine.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.552
Okay, um...

09:12.552 --> 09:13.470
I'll see you at home.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.888
Okay, bye.

09:14.888 --> 09:15.847
Bye.

09:22.604 --> 09:23.646
<i>Dr. Hawthorne's office.</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:24.981
Hi, this is Avery Hastings.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.649
I'd like to make
an appointment, please?

09:26.649 --> 09:28.234
<i>Oh, Dr. Hawthorne
is out of the office</i>

09:28.234 --> 09:29.235
<i>until the 17th.</i>

09:30.737 --> 09:31.946
I think I might be pregnant.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.740
Would you like
to see somebody else?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.409
No, I--

09:36.409 --> 09:37.285
I thought I was pregnant
last time,

09:37.285 --> 09:38.745
and I wasn't,

09:38.745 --> 09:40.538
and it was really hard
on me and my husband, so...

09:40.538 --> 09:41.915
whether the news is good or bad,

09:41.915 --> 09:43.500
I just really need to hear it
from Dr. Hawthorne.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.876
<i>I understand.</i>

09:44.876 --> 09:47.921
<i>How is 9:45 on the 18th?</i>

09:47.921 --> 09:49.297
Oh, that'd be perfect.
Thank you so much.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.594
So, do you have any news?

09:54.594 --> 09:56.429
I'm seeing the doctor
next week.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.847
Does Peter know?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.891
<i>No, not until
I know for sure. Also...</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:03.812
There's another man in my life.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.440
Sorry, what did you say?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.900
I think I'm in love.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.444
What does Peter think?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.737
<i>Oh, Peter loves him, too.</i>

10:13.988 --> 10:15.323
He's the contractor we hired.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.451
You guys,
he really gets the house.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.619
<i>Oh, good.</i>

10:19.619 --> 10:21.287
Your Baby Daddy
and the other man

10:21.287 --> 10:22.247
are getting along.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.540
Tracy!

10:23.540 --> 10:27.127
- Too much?
- Too soon.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.878
No pregnancy jokes

10:28.878 --> 10:30.088
<i>until she knows for sure.</i>

10:30.088 --> 10:31.214
There's also
another man in my life.

10:31.214 --> 10:32.716
What is going on out there?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.342
Peter knows and he approves...

10:34.342 --> 10:35.969
but I'm not sure that I do.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.096
Okay, now I'm going
to need you to elaborate.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.306
He's the new Executive Director
of the Museum--

10:40.306 --> 10:41.766
Mason Sylvester.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.101
<i>I haven't actually
met him yet.</i>

10:43.101 --> 10:44.936
Oh, I have.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.438
He's been
to several of my auctions.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.731
Really?

10:47.731 --> 10:48.648
Well, give me the scoop.
What's he like?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.483
I find him grating.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.359
He is such a--

10:52.902 --> 10:55.155
an opinionated person.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.490
<i>Well, I'm sure you two
will do fine.</i>

10:57.490 --> 10:58.742
To know you is to love you.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.035
Aw, thanks.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.453
I just feel like
I have so much going on.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.663
Uh, could it be because you do?

11:03.663 --> 11:05.915
But we are here
for moral support, 24/7.

11:05.915 --> 11:07.208
Yeah, words
you may live to regret.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.293
Never.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.377
Ever.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.591
Sam says he's starting
the kitchen tomorrow.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.051
So, it looks like

11:16.051 --> 11:16.968
you'll be spared from my cooking
for a little while.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.428
I enjoyed every second of it.

11:18.428 --> 11:19.846
Liar.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.474
You know what?

11:22.474 --> 11:23.516
I gotta bring the veil
to the museum

11:23.516 --> 11:24.559
before the painters
start in here.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.519
What do you think about

11:26.519 --> 11:27.896
a cinnamon and toast
combination?

11:29.147 --> 11:30.023
For breakfast?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.107
No, for the walls and the trim.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.526
Too monochromatic?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.694
Yeah, too monochromatic.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.279
I'm gonna ask your mom.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.739
It's gonna be so great
to have her help.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.449
Yeah, I was surprised
she volunteered.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.036
I don't think
she would admit this,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.037
but...

11:44.037 --> 11:46.456
I think
she's a little lonely.

11:46.456 --> 11:47.832
Why? She's got friends,

11:47.832 --> 11:49.376
all the people
at the Foundation.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.044
Yeah, but maybe she needs,

11:51.044 --> 11:53.296
you know, a little romance
in her life?

11:53.296 --> 11:54.839
I don't know.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.217
Her and my father had
a pretty story-book marriage.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.885
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
she can't find love again.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.554
I just...

12:01.554 --> 12:02.764
I don't see my mother dating.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.893
I've got a big day tomorrow.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.728
I'm presenting my proposal
for that art program

12:08.728 --> 12:09.938
to the Board.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.606
Aw, I'm so proud of you.

12:11.606 --> 12:13.775
Well, hold your applause
until they say yes.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.173
Maybe apricot and toast?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.635
For breakfast
or for the walls?

12:40.635 --> 12:42.262
Both.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.740
Huh...

13:01.740 --> 13:03.616
Oh, sorry,
the exhibit's not open yet.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.827
This is it?

13:05.827 --> 13:07.579
A painting and some lace?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.665
I don't see
how this merits an exhibit.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.793
I guess, then,
you don't have to attend.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.837
I'm afraid I have no choice.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.339
I'm the Executive Director
at the Museum.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.966
Oh, right...

13:19.966 --> 13:21.217
Hi. Hi. Mason Sylvester?

13:21.217 --> 13:22.802
Guilty as charged.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.971
Ah, you must be Avery?

13:26.014 --> 13:27.974
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.392
Yeah, the exhibit
has already been announced.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.227
There are new pieces
arriving every day.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.981
So, we just
have to make the best of it?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.693
We have framed pieces of lace
from other countries,

13:38.693 --> 13:40.278
we have stand-alone pieces...

13:40.278 --> 13:43.573
and we also have
Amici's "Portrait of a Bride".

13:43.573 --> 13:44.699
It was actually found

13:44.699 --> 13:45.950
in the basement
of the Stanbridge.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.411
Yes, no, I'm aware
of its history.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.288
And the actual veil
that the bride is wearing

13:50.288 --> 13:51.331
will be on display.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.916
It's made
of the finest Burano lace.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.334
It's so beautiful.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.836
I found it in an antique store
in San Francisco.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.171
So, you have
a personal attachment.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.464
I do.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.174
I wore it at my wedding.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.467
Hmm.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.885
And you're married
to one of the Board members,

14:03.885 --> 14:05.053
Peter Hastings?

14:06.096 --> 14:07.013
I am,

14:07.013 --> 14:08.181
but I worked for the Stanbridge

14:08.181 --> 14:09.557
long before
Peter and I ever even met.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.767
Ah.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.186
Excuse me, Mason?

14:13.186 --> 14:15.689
I have the Tate Modern London
returning your call.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.065
Ah, excellent.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.400
If you'll excuse me.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.526
Sure.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.156
So, what do you think of Mason?

14:25.156 --> 14:26.700
Well, not warm and not fuzzy.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.034
No.

14:32.664 --> 14:34.708
I know Sam says
it has to be brought up to code,

14:34.708 --> 14:37.085
but I can just see it, you know?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.129
Stockings on the mantel,
a roaring fire...

14:39.129 --> 14:41.214
And a gentle rain
for good measure.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.091
Oh, I just love this house.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.176
I can't stop
thinking about it, you know?

14:45.176 --> 14:46.386
And what everything's
gonna look like.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.179
Oh, so it's the house
that inspires you?

14:49.556 --> 14:50.682
I guess it is.

14:50.682 --> 14:53.351
Ooh, I missed that.

14:53.351 --> 14:55.645
I may have to replace
these windows.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.188
Just don't replace that view.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.233
Now, did you decide
on any colors yet?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.901
Yes, you know what?
Let me grab my samples.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.737
I have a few ideas.

15:03.737 --> 15:04.738
Real-life examples

15:04.738 --> 15:06.072
are so much better

15:06.072 --> 15:07.657
than those little,
teeny, tiny paint swatches.

15:07.657 --> 15:10.577
They evoke the feeling
of a color.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.040
This will go with everything--

15:15.040 --> 15:16.041
from holiday dinners

15:16.041 --> 15:18.460
to casual Sunday brunch.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.502
For the dining-room walls.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.463
Elegant, yet warm...

15:22.964 --> 15:24.215
And I've been thinking a lot
about the bedroom,

15:24.215 --> 15:25.175
and I was having trouble,

15:25.175 --> 15:26.468
and then I found this.

15:29.137 --> 15:33.266
I wore this in my hair
the first time Peter and I met,

15:33.266 --> 15:34.809
and I just love the purple.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
Ah, the purple is so beautiful,

15:36.102 --> 15:37.187
but I'm thinking, you know what?

15:37.187 --> 15:38.063
Let's do it
a little bit more muted,

15:38.063 --> 15:39.439
a little bit more dusty,

15:39.439 --> 15:41.232
and then this deep charcoal,
right here?

15:41.232 --> 15:42.275
That would be great
for the floors.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.235
That could work.

15:44.235 --> 15:47.280
And I really love
this creamy color.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.656
I thought this would be great
for the trim,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.241
but maybe
with a splash of peach.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.785
I'm gonna have to find you
something for that color.

15:51.785 --> 15:53.244
Hey, sorry I'm late.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.579
My class went a bit long.

15:54.579 --> 15:55.622
- Hi!
- What'd I miss?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.040
The dining room...

15:57.040 --> 15:58.667
and the bedroom.

15:58.667 --> 15:59.668
For the walls.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.960
I don't get it.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.881
Real-life examples
evoke a feeling of color.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.257
Yes, just don't go too bright
with the purple.

16:06.257 --> 16:07.884
More dusty and muted. Gotcha.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.094
Yes. What do you think?

16:11.721 --> 16:12.847
Darling, if you love it,
I love it.

16:12.847 --> 16:14.140
Aw...

16:14.140 --> 16:15.392
That's the right answer.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.028
Aw, it's gonna be so gorgeous.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.323
How can you tell?
I haven't even started.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.492
Avery sees everything
through rose-colored glasses.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.660
Oh, yeah?

16:33.660 --> 16:34.786
Tell me how you see this.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.377
Yeah...

16:45.046 --> 16:46.881
What are we looking at here?

16:46.881 --> 16:49.676
Well, it's a leak of some kind,

16:49.676 --> 16:50.760
probably coming from the drain.

16:50.760 --> 16:51.720
It doesn't look that bad.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.389
Yeah, well, hang onto
your glasses now.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.183
I discovered another leak
in the laundry room.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.269
One second.
Grace, hi!

17:00.228 --> 17:02.105
Yes, that sounds great.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.773
Oh, I'd love that.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.442
Your mom wants us to look at
some furniture that she found.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.860
Well, I can't.

17:06.860 --> 17:07.485
I've gotta prep for my meeting
with the school board.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.821
Okay, I'll go.

17:09.821 --> 17:11.197
It looks like it'll just be me,
so I'll meet you there.

17:13.283 --> 17:16.411
Said she found some furniture
for the family room.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.662
Family room?

17:17.662 --> 17:19.372
I thought we were calling it
the library?

17:19.372 --> 17:22.917
What? No, I don't know
what to call it--not yet.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.878
Hey, we can call it
whatever you want, okay?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.713
You're right, no...

17:26.713 --> 17:27.964
It's-- We'll call it
whatever--

17:27.964 --> 17:29.215
It doesn't--

17:29.215 --> 17:30.759
It doesn't matter,
as long as we're together.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.093
Yeah, that's right.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.807
I'm sorry, I don't know
what got into her.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.395
I've been married for 22 years

17:42.395 --> 17:44.230
and my wife is still a mystery.

17:50.153 --> 17:52.197
There's a lot of great stuff
in here right now.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.699
This sofa might work.

17:54.699 --> 17:56.868
Oh, this is beautiful,

17:56.868 --> 17:57.952
and you know what?

17:57.952 --> 17:59.412
If we went
with something like this,

17:59.412 --> 18:00.955
it would give us
a lot of options for the drapes.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.123
Right.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.458
Now, Peter's tall,

18:03.458 --> 18:04.626
so we have to take that
into consideration.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.252
But it also has to work
for short people,

18:06.252 --> 18:07.462
so I think the sofa
should be deeper

18:07.462 --> 18:08.296
rather than high,

18:08.296 --> 18:09.589
so nobody falls off.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.508
Oh, excuse me a second.

18:14.302 --> 18:15.470
Hey, Lucy,
can I call you right back?

18:16.805 --> 18:18.264
Oh, yeah.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.392
Oh, yeah,
let me look for it.

18:20.392 --> 18:22.268
The Belgian Lace didn't arrive

18:22.268 --> 18:24.312
so she needs the invoice
to contact the courier.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.647
Can you hold this
for a second?

18:25.647 --> 18:27.691
I'll look in my purse
that I have with me,

18:27.691 --> 18:30.068
but I don't think...

18:30.068 --> 18:31.111
No, I don't see it.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.696
Did you check my desk?

18:32.696 --> 18:33.947
Okay, listen,
don't tell Mason, please?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.490
Absolutely not.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.200
No, really, don't tell him
because it's not lost,

18:37.200 --> 18:38.201
and we're gonna find it...

18:39.452 --> 18:41.204
Yeah, I'll be there
and we'll figure it out.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.925
Yeah, I'll be there
really soon, okay?

18:55.885 --> 18:56.970
Thank you.
Thank you for trying.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.014
Do not worry.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.056
How much longer
are we gonna be here?

19:00.056 --> 19:01.433
We're leaving right away.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.517
Okay, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

19:03.727 --> 19:04.978
Are you upset?

19:04.978 --> 19:06.271
I'm sorry if I was being
too picky about the sofa.

19:06.271 --> 19:07.647
No, it's not about the sofa.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.442
It's about that man over there.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.154
What about that man?

19:14.154 --> 19:15.989
He's someone I knew
in another life.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.240
Ooh, what other life?

19:18.783 --> 19:21.161
He's the man I almost married
before I met Peter's father.

19:21.161 --> 19:23.538
So, go over there
and say hello.

19:23.538 --> 19:25.123
No, I-I--

19:25.123 --> 19:26.291
It's been so long,

19:26.291 --> 19:28.043
I don't know
what I would even say.

19:28.043 --> 19:29.586
Well, apparently, he does.

19:32.756 --> 19:33.882
Grace?

19:35.091 --> 19:37.510
I thought that was you!

19:37.510 --> 19:38.887
Clark.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.347
What a surprise.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.140
It is so good to see you.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.558
It's good to see you, too.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.187
This is
my daughter-in-law, Avery.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.104
Hi, nice to meet you.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.147
You, too.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.482
If you'll excuse me,

19:50.482 --> 19:52.359
there's just something
I wanted to look at.

19:56.488 --> 19:57.489
Well...

19:59.866 --> 20:00.867
What are you doing in Boston?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.494
I just moved back.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.579
That's why I'm here,
looking for furniture.

20:04.579 --> 20:05.830
Oh.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.041
Isn't that a coincidence?

20:08.041 --> 20:09.584
Well, what are the chances?

20:10.627 --> 20:11.795
Well...

20:11.795 --> 20:14.172
It's great to run into you.

20:14.172 --> 20:15.715
Yeah, you too.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.925
Well, you look terrific.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.718
You look fantastic.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.261
Thanks.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.939
So, the Belgian lace
was delayed in shipping.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.399
- Lucy!
- Coming.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.162
Hello?

20:46.162 --> 20:47.288
Dr. Hawthorne, hi.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.128
Really?

20:53.128 --> 20:54.254
You're positive?

20:54.254 --> 20:55.630
It's 100% sure?

20:59.592 --> 21:00.927
Thank you!

21:00.927 --> 21:02.303
Thank you so much, doctor!

21:04.931 --> 21:05.890
I'm gonna have a baby.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.021
I'm gonna have a baby.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.369
It's official...

21:26.369 --> 21:27.662
I'm pregnant!

21:29.247 --> 21:30.457
Yes, I knew it!

21:31.499 --> 21:32.876
We're so happy for you!

21:32.876 --> 21:34.294
<i>I am so excited.</i>

21:34.294 --> 21:36.254
I can't believe it.

21:36.254 --> 21:37.464
You guys, I'm gonna be a mom.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.343
I'm just thrilled,
and I'm scared, and I'm nervous,

21:41.343 --> 21:43.470
<i>and I'm just
totally overwhelmed.</i>

21:43.470 --> 21:45.055
It's all those hormones.

21:45.055 --> 21:46.306
- Have you told Peter?
- <i>No, I haven't told him yet.</i>

21:46.306 --> 21:47.932
He's teaching right now.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.310
He is going to be so excited.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.853
You know, I've been dreaming
about how to tell him,

21:51.853 --> 21:52.979
and I was thinking

21:52.979 --> 21:54.481
I would take him

21:54.481 --> 21:55.857
to the Italian restaurant
where we had our first date.

21:55.857 --> 21:59.110
I mean, I'm telling
the man I love that I'm pregnant

21:59.110 --> 22:01.571
with someone he's gonna love
for the rest of his life.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.656
It's just a moment
we're gonna remember forever,

22:03.656 --> 22:05.700
and I want it to be perfect.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.411
That's very sweet.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.497
Very Avery.

22:20.215 --> 22:21.091
Mario, hi!

22:22.592 --> 22:24.719
Avery.
Are you coming for lunch?

22:24.719 --> 22:27.639
I just came to go over the menu
for the opening of the exhibit.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.682
Yes.

22:28.682 --> 22:31.059
I have it...

22:31.059 --> 22:32.143
right here.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.231
I added my Mozzarella Arancini.

22:36.231 --> 22:37.357
I know it's Peter's favorite.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.025
Ah, delicious.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.485
This looks amazing.

22:40.485 --> 22:41.861
Yeah, Peter loves this place.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.571
I mean, so do I.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.156
You know, we had
our very first date here?

22:45.156 --> 22:46.866
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:46.866 --> 22:50.495
I'd like to make a reservation
for Saturday night,

22:50.495 --> 22:52.330
and I want to sit
in the same spot.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.373
And where was that?

22:53.373 --> 22:54.624
Right here, at the bar.

22:54.624 --> 22:56.501
It was...

22:56.501 --> 22:58.503
Ah, it was these two seats.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.338
Well, consider them yours...

23:00.338 --> 23:01.673
and what time?

23:01.673 --> 23:03.591
The same time that it was then.

23:03.591 --> 23:05.051
8:00 p.m.
on Saturday night, please?

23:05.051 --> 23:05.927
<i>Ci vediamo.</i>

23:05.927 --> 23:06.928
<i>Ciao, Bella.</i>

23:06.928 --> 23:07.804
Good to see you!

23:16.146 --> 23:17.397
I was just gonna order
some dinner.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.233
Does Chinese or Thai sound good?

23:20.233 --> 23:21.860
Either one.

23:21.860 --> 23:23.069
Honestly, though,

23:23.069 --> 23:24.571
I'm just getting
sick and tired of take-out.

23:24.571 --> 23:25.697
I know.
Me, too.

23:27.782 --> 23:29.034
Hey, do you want to go out
on Saturday night?

23:29.034 --> 23:32.120
We could have
a nice romantic dinner...?

23:32.120 --> 23:33.204
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.291
Is that for the presentation?

23:36.291 --> 23:38.209
Yeah.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.377
I'm supposed to meet

23:39.377 --> 23:41.212
with the school board
Friday morning,

23:41.212 --> 23:42.922
but there's just--

23:42.922 --> 23:43.840
there's so much red tape.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.301
They don't seem to understand

23:46.301 --> 23:47.635
how important art is
for these kids' lives.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.472
They need a way
to express themselves.

23:52.557 --> 23:53.600
What's wrong?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.021
It's just...

23:58.021 --> 24:00.357
that's how I was as a kid...

24:00.357 --> 24:02.901
you know?

24:02.901 --> 24:04.569
I mean, my father's whole world
was science,

24:04.569 --> 24:07.113
and his one and only son was--

24:07.113 --> 24:08.615
he was into art.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.454
He never said it, but...

24:14.454 --> 24:15.872
but I know he was disappointed.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.585
It takes courage
to follow your own path,

24:20.585 --> 24:21.795
and you're just trying

24:21.795 --> 24:23.380
to give these kids
that same opportunity.

24:23.380 --> 24:24.923
I think--

24:24.923 --> 24:26.675
I think
he would have admired that.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.222
You know what,
my mother was right.

24:35.225 --> 24:36.267
I did marry well.

24:37.769 --> 24:39.104
So did I.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.071
This one really captures
the feel of the house--

24:48.071 --> 24:49.489
the architecture, the era...

24:49.489 --> 24:51.032
but this one?

24:51.032 --> 24:52.742
Well, this one
says "friendly kitchen",

24:52.742 --> 24:53.993
where we can gather around,

24:53.993 --> 24:55.704
we can cook,
we can laugh about our day...

24:55.704 --> 24:58.748
I think I'd go
with the talkative one.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.208
Really?

25:00.208 --> 25:02.669
Hey, you want to get in on
the backsplash sweepstakes?

25:02.669 --> 25:04.087
I can't make up my mind.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.257
Um, whatever you want.

25:07.257 --> 25:08.800
I just--
I need a few minutes.

25:20.895 --> 25:23.440
What happened
with the school board?

25:23.440 --> 25:26.026
The meeting was postponed
until Monday.

25:26.026 --> 25:27.027
Not a good sign.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.528
I'm sorry.

25:28.528 --> 25:31.031
I have 72 hours
to rewrite this proposal

25:31.031 --> 25:32.240
and make it stronger.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.117
It's just--

25:34.117 --> 25:35.785
There's so much riding on this.
I can't fail.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.246
Then you won't.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.207
Thanks.

25:42.876 --> 25:44.210
Of course.

25:45.503 --> 25:46.379
Hi, Mario.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.714
I am so sorry,

25:47.714 --> 25:48.423
but I actually have to cancel
our reservation

25:48.423 --> 25:49.716
<i>for Saturday night.</i>

25:49.716 --> 25:50.675
But you were so excited.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.135
What happened?

25:52.135 --> 25:53.303
<i>Peter has to work,</i>

25:53.303 --> 25:54.554
<i>and I just don't want
any distractions</i>

25:54.554 --> 25:56.014
<i>- when I give him the good news.</i>
- What news?

25:56.014 --> 25:56.973
Uh, what? Sorry?

25:56.973 --> 25:58.224
What news?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.685
Uh, that... that...

26:00.685 --> 26:01.936
That I got a new car.

26:03.355 --> 26:04.773
He didn't see it in the garage?

26:04.773 --> 26:07.650
Right, because that's something
he would have noticed...

26:07.650 --> 26:09.569
<i>Um, no, it--
You know what?</i>

26:09.569 --> 26:11.780
We ordered it.
It's being shipped.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.115
So, could we come
next weekend instead?

26:14.115 --> 26:16.826
Saturday night and 8:00?

26:16.826 --> 26:18.370
Perfect. Thank you so much.
We'll see you then.

26:29.923 --> 26:32.967
Well, dinner was great.

26:32.967 --> 26:35.303
Well, I just wanted to try
and thank you

26:35.303 --> 26:37.847
for agreeing
to furnish my place.

26:37.847 --> 26:40.475
You have a great eye, Grace.

26:40.475 --> 26:41.768
As keen and as green as ever.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.481
Well, I haven't been
on a date in ages,

26:46.481 --> 26:48.942
and I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.151
Well, I think
it's going great so far.

26:51.361 --> 26:52.404
I think it is, too.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.949
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

26:55.949 --> 26:57.158
Um...

26:59.494 --> 27:00.870
I really enjoy
your company, Grace.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.039
I really enjoy
yours, too, Clark.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.044
Probably more
than I feel I should admit.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.719
You know,
I was married to Daniel

27:15.719 --> 27:17.303
for such a long time

27:17.303 --> 27:19.222
that it just feels a little odd
to hold another man's hand.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.474
Mm.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.644
I can understand that...

27:24.644 --> 27:26.187
but it's not like we just met.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.606
No...

27:28.606 --> 27:30.358
And I've been wanting
to hold your hand again

27:30.358 --> 27:31.735
for a long time.

27:44.539 --> 27:46.332
Would you like a cup of coffee?

27:46.332 --> 27:48.084
Oh, no, thank you.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.002
Are you sure?

27:49.002 --> 27:50.378
Yes, very sure.
Thank you.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.382
It's my one indulgence,

27:54.382 --> 27:56.468
just the suggestion of caramel
without the carbs.

27:57.677 --> 27:58.845
I blend my own roast.

27:58.845 --> 28:01.723
Oh, well, you can really
smell that caramel.

28:01.723 --> 28:02.766
It's really good.

28:02.766 --> 28:04.100
I'm okay.
Maybe next time.

28:06.311 --> 28:09.689
Well, let's discuss
the decline in attendance.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.149
You know, when I took this job,

28:11.149 --> 28:13.568
my mandate was to bring
more attention to the museum.

28:13.568 --> 28:14.986
Well, you and I
have the same goal.

28:14.986 --> 28:16.446
Mm...

28:16.446 --> 28:18.865
yeah, I don't see
how a lace exhibit

28:18.865 --> 28:20.241
and a painting that's been
on the same wall for two years

28:20.241 --> 28:21.743
is going to create
a lot of excitement.

28:23.203 --> 28:26.373
Well, the Amici and lace
may not be your cup of tea...

28:26.373 --> 28:28.917
or coffee, or whatever...

28:28.917 --> 28:32.337
but it certainly resonates
with many of our patrons,

28:32.337 --> 28:34.130
and it resonates with me.

28:36.091 --> 28:38.885
See, I interned
at the Museum of Modern Art.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.178
I spent years at the Guggenheim,

28:40.178 --> 28:42.138
so my expertise
lies in modern art,

28:42.138 --> 28:44.140
and that is the direction that
I intend to take this museum.

28:45.558 --> 28:46.935
Well...

28:46.935 --> 28:48.103
I need to know
that I have your support.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.023
As long as
I can have my own opinion.

28:55.068 --> 28:56.111
I'm sorry.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.278
The Belgian lace
is about to be delivered

28:57.278 --> 28:58.405
and I need to sign for it.

28:58.405 --> 28:59.280
If you'll excuse me.

29:06.496 --> 29:07.414
Did you tell Peter?

29:07.414 --> 29:08.581
<i>Not yet,</i>

29:08.581 --> 29:09.916
but I have to this weekend.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.001
I mean, the secret's
getting harder to keep.

29:11.001 --> 29:12.419
I'm actually having symptoms.

29:12.419 --> 29:13.586
Morning sickness?

29:13.586 --> 29:14.629
<i>Yes, a little,</i>

29:14.629 --> 29:15.964
and "pregnancy brain".

29:15.964 --> 29:17.757
I-- I keep losing everything.

29:17.757 --> 29:18.633
Oh, and my sense of smell--

29:18.633 --> 29:20.510
it is like a super-power.

29:20.510 --> 29:21.761
Yeah, it's all those hormones.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.763
<i>Well, roses are amazing,</i>

29:23.763 --> 29:25.890
<i>salmon not so much.</i>

29:25.890 --> 29:27.225
Oh, Mason-- He drinks
this caramel-flavored coffee.

29:27.225 --> 29:28.727
I cannot stand it.
Just the thought of it

29:28.727 --> 29:29.561
<i>makes me feel ill.</i>

29:31.187 --> 29:32.397
How are the two of you
getting along?

29:32.397 --> 29:34.899
Well, he thinks I'm just
some sentimental woman

29:34.899 --> 29:36.443
who's married
to a Board member,

29:36.443 --> 29:39.529
but I happen to also be
a really amazing curator...

29:39.529 --> 29:40.697
who cannot find her car keys.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.615
Okay, well,
when you do find those keys,

29:42.615 --> 29:44.075
drive home carefully.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.660
You have
very precious cargo onboard.

29:45.660 --> 29:48.163
Aw, you might have
that cargo, too, someday.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.748
Oh, no.

29:49.748 --> 29:50.790
No cargo for me.

29:50.790 --> 29:51.958
I'm fine as I am.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.168
Hey listen, ladies,
I've gotta run.

29:53.168 --> 29:54.336
<i>I love you both.</i>

29:54.336 --> 29:55.211
Okay, talk soon.

29:57.922 --> 29:58.965
Where are those keys?

30:11.019 --> 30:12.812
I've got some samples
for the curtains here.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.939
When do you expect Avery?

30:14.939 --> 30:16.858
She can't find her car keys
so it might be a while.

30:18.693 --> 30:19.944
Oh, wow!

30:19.944 --> 30:21.279
Some of these
are quite impressive.

30:21.279 --> 30:23.323
Oh, yeah,
the kids in my class did them.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.991
I'm thinking about
getting them framed.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.535
You know, maybe I should
show these to the Board?

30:27.535 --> 30:28.661
They say more than I ever could.

30:28.661 --> 30:31.998
Aw, you just reminded me
of your father.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.249
Always fighting for your cause.

30:36.086 --> 30:37.212
Oh!

30:37.212 --> 30:38.672
Oh, I've gotta go home
and change.

30:38.672 --> 30:41.174
I'm going
to the theatre tonight.

30:41.174 --> 30:42.967
I'm going with someone
I've been seeing.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.221
Uh, wait...

30:46.221 --> 30:47.263
Like...

30:47.263 --> 30:48.515
Like a date?

30:48.515 --> 30:50.767
Yes.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.268
He's becoming
very important to me.

30:53.812 --> 30:55.397
We're going to Martha's Vineyard
for my birthday.

30:57.190 --> 30:58.775
Didn't you just
meet this guy?

30:58.775 --> 31:01.486
No, no, I've known Clark
since college.

31:01.486 --> 31:02.987
We were engaged to be married.

31:04.406 --> 31:05.824
What?

31:05.824 --> 31:07.951
I-- Why am I just
finding this out now?

31:07.951 --> 31:09.494
I never expected
to see him again.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.455
Mom, I think if this guy's
this important to you,

31:12.455 --> 31:14.082
he should meet your family.

31:14.082 --> 31:16.251
Well, then, why don't we
all have dinner together?

31:16.251 --> 31:17.502
Saturday night.

31:17.502 --> 31:19.421
I think you're going to like him
as well as I do.

31:20.714 --> 31:21.715
These are here.

31:21.715 --> 31:22.674
Bye!

31:25.927 --> 31:27.053
I don't think so.

31:34.519 --> 31:35.729
So, you already knew
about this guy?

31:35.729 --> 31:37.230
I was there when they met--

31:37.230 --> 31:38.440
or met again--

31:38.440 --> 31:39.566
at the furniture showroom.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.026
Why didn't you
tell me about it?

31:41.026 --> 31:43.570
Well, I just thought
Grace should tell you herself.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.071
My mother
is a very wealthy woman.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.364
She's a sitting duck

31:46.364 --> 31:49.117
for any old boyfriend
that suddenly reappears.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.493
I really don't think
you would say that

31:50.493 --> 31:52.037
if you'd seen them together.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.288
Well, we're going to see them
together on Saturday night.

31:53.288 --> 31:54.914
What do you mean?

31:54.914 --> 31:57.250
We have a dinner with them
at The Astoria.

31:57.250 --> 31:58.418
No, we're--

31:58.418 --> 31:59.711
We're going to Mario's
on Saturday night.

31:59.711 --> 32:01.463
I think The Astoria
is more my mother's speed.

32:01.463 --> 32:02.839
Yeah, but you and I

32:02.839 --> 32:04.341
are going to dinner together
on Saturday, remember?

32:05.550 --> 32:07.052
My mother seems
to really like this guy,

32:07.052 --> 32:08.887
and I don't want her
to get hurt.

32:08.887 --> 32:11.306
I need to check him out
before it's too late.

32:13.641 --> 32:14.601
Goodnight!

32:14.601 --> 32:16.019
Goodnight.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.067
Oh, sorry.

32:23.860 --> 32:26.363
Oh... Okay, let's just--

32:26.363 --> 32:27.781
We'll go on three.

32:27.781 --> 32:28.948
Like, go on three,
or right after three?

32:28.948 --> 32:30.158
The number three,
and then we clap.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.118
- Okay.
- Okay, one, two, three.

32:33.411 --> 32:34.662
There.

32:36.748 --> 32:38.375
You have gotta be kidding me.

32:45.674 --> 32:47.676
Thank you.

32:47.676 --> 32:50.178
The most extraordinary lace
arrived from Spain today.

32:50.178 --> 32:52.514
Some of it belonged
to Queen Isabella.

32:53.807 --> 32:56.476
Clark, why don't you
come with me to Avery's event?

32:56.476 --> 32:58.687
She's curating a new exhibit
at the Stanbridge.

32:58.687 --> 33:00.146
Oh, I would love to.

33:03.191 --> 33:05.652
So, Clark, what brought you
back to Boston?

33:05.652 --> 33:07.153
Actually, it was a job offer.

33:07.153 --> 33:09.739
I thought
that you were retired?

33:09.739 --> 33:11.157
Well, I did retire
from my practice.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.242
So, you're a lawyer?

33:12.242 --> 33:13.201
A doctor.

33:13.201 --> 33:14.369
Oh, what kind of doctor?

33:14.369 --> 33:15.495
A pediatrician.

33:15.495 --> 33:17.038
Aw, you must love kids.

33:17.038 --> 33:18.790
I do like kids.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.166
I love them.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.960
I never had any kids of my own,

33:21.960 --> 33:23.545
but I got to care
for thousands over the years.

33:24.796 --> 33:25.839
What was the job offer?

33:25.839 --> 33:27.507
Well, it's only part-time,

33:27.507 --> 33:29.843
but it's something
I've always wanted to do.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.219
What-- What is that?

33:31.219 --> 33:32.220
Teach.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.596
Peter teaches, too!

33:33.596 --> 33:35.682
Art.

33:35.682 --> 33:37.684
I'm starting this Fall
at the Harvard Medical School.

33:37.684 --> 33:38.852
Oh, great!

33:38.852 --> 33:40.854
He's actually starting
a program for kids

33:40.854 --> 33:42.772
that he really hopes
to take citywide.

33:42.772 --> 33:44.274
That is very impressive.

33:45.692 --> 33:47.318
Well, it's not as impressive
as Harvard.

33:53.283 --> 33:55.118
I ordered
the Chocolate Soufflé

33:55.118 --> 33:56.786
for dessert.

33:56.786 --> 33:59.414
Well, it's my most favorite
dessert in the world.

34:00.707 --> 34:02.125
Yes, I remember.

34:04.919 --> 34:05.879
Peter.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.005
What?

34:07.005 --> 34:08.590
Be nice.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.846
<i>What is that noise, Tracy?</i>

34:14.846 --> 34:16.389
<i>Are you jumping
on the trampoline?</i>

34:16.389 --> 34:19.059
Oh, yeah, we ended up
switching to a treadmill

34:19.059 --> 34:20.852
because Nick didn't want
to bounce,

34:20.852 --> 34:22.062
and there wasn't room for both.

34:22.062 --> 34:24.189
Oh, exercise
is really important.

34:24.189 --> 34:25.231
Really helps clear the mind.

34:26.983 --> 34:28.526
I have so much to do
before the baby arrives.

34:28.526 --> 34:29.778
<i>I don't recommend</i>

34:29.778 --> 34:30.945
<i>remodeling a house
while you're pregnant.</i>

34:30.945 --> 34:32.822
Avery, did you tell Peter yet?

34:32.822 --> 34:33.823
<i>I've been trying to.</i>

34:33.823 --> 34:34.949
We were supposed to have

34:34.949 --> 34:37.118
dinner at Mario's
on Saturday night,

34:37.118 --> 34:39.287
but he's so concerned
about his mom's new boyfriend,

34:39.287 --> 34:41.289
he insisted that we have
dinner with them instead.

34:41.289 --> 34:45.293
Wait, are you telling me
Grace Hastings has a boyfriend?

34:45.293 --> 34:48.213
Yeah. It's an old romance
that's been rekindled.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.756
We were shopping for a sofa,

34:49.756 --> 34:51.174
and actually,

34:51.174 --> 34:52.759
I was bringing
the veil to the museum,

34:52.759 --> 34:54.094
so I asked Grace--

34:54.094 --> 34:54.969
I asked her to hold it
for a second--

34:54.969 --> 34:55.929
and Clark just appeared.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.097
Oh, Avery.

34:57.097 --> 34:58.556
<i>I'm just saying,</i>

34:58.556 --> 35:00.141
they're on their way
to Martha's Vineyard right now.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.018
I'm happy for Grace.

35:02.018 --> 35:03.311
<i>I know.</i>

35:03.311 --> 35:04.521
Peter's having
a really hard time with it.

35:04.521 --> 35:05.980
I don't--
I don't really know why.

35:05.980 --> 35:07.273
<i>Well, if you decide</i>

35:07.273 --> 35:10.276
to tell Peter that
he's gonna be a father,

35:10.276 --> 35:12.028
I'm pretty sure
it'll improve his mood.

35:12.028 --> 35:13.113
I know.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.406
I have to tell him soon.

35:14.406 --> 35:15.657
My symptoms are getting
really hard to hide.

35:18.118 --> 35:19.494
I just want him to be
as excited as I am.

35:19.494 --> 35:22.372
I'm not sure that's possible.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.587
Oh, no.
What happened?

35:29.587 --> 35:30.839
Basement flooded.

35:30.839 --> 35:31.965
Did you call Sam?

35:31.965 --> 35:33.758
Yeah, he called the plumber,

35:33.758 --> 35:34.843
but then the plumber just called

35:34.843 --> 35:36.344
and said
that his truck broke down.

35:36.344 --> 35:37.721
Sam told me to turn off
the water until he gets here.

35:37.721 --> 35:38.680
Okay, what do we do?

35:38.680 --> 35:39.764
Buy another house.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.558
No, I love this place,
and so do you.

35:41.558 --> 35:42.851
I love it a lot more
when it's not leaking.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.729
Now we've gotta keep
the water off

35:45.729 --> 35:47.147
until Sam gets here,

35:47.147 --> 35:48.231
and then they might want
to turn off the electricity,

35:48.231 --> 35:49.232
so I say we just
go to a hotel tonight.

35:50.859 --> 35:52.110
That is perfect.

35:52.110 --> 35:53.528
Perfect?

35:53.528 --> 35:55.655
What's perfect about
no water and no electricity?

35:55.655 --> 35:56.781
No, I mean, just--

35:56.781 --> 35:57.991
Staying in a hotel, you know?

35:57.991 --> 35:58.825
It'll-- It'll be romantic.

36:01.369 --> 36:02.579
I have gotta get a pair

36:02.579 --> 36:03.788
of those rose-colored glasses
you've got.

36:03.788 --> 36:05.874
I can meet you there
after-- after work.

36:05.874 --> 36:07.083
If the house
doesn't float away.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.710
I'm gonna make
a reservation.

36:08.710 --> 36:09.794
It might float away.

36:13.673 --> 36:15.091
<i>Hotel Astoria,
how may I help you?</i>

36:15.091 --> 36:16.468
Oh, hi!

36:16.468 --> 36:18.178
I'd like to book
a really nice room.

36:18.178 --> 36:19.554
Is the honeymoon suite
available?

36:19.554 --> 36:20.847
<i>Yes. Is it for a honeymoon?</i>

36:20.847 --> 36:22.182
No, it's--

36:22.182 --> 36:24.893
It's not actually
our honeymoon, it's just--

36:24.893 --> 36:26.394
Well, it's
a very special occasion.

36:26.394 --> 36:27.937
One that we're always
gonna remember.

36:37.447 --> 36:38.907
Coming!

36:47.040 --> 36:48.124
Oh!

36:48.124 --> 36:49.417
Are you all right?

36:49.417 --> 36:50.919
I need to lie down.

36:52.587 --> 36:54.756
Okay, come over here.
What happened?

36:54.756 --> 36:57.217
Sam's plumber never showed up,
so we had to call another one.

36:57.217 --> 36:59.052
He was pretty sure
it was a busted pipe,

36:59.052 --> 37:01.596
but he couldn't be positive
until he got under the house,

37:01.596 --> 37:02.931
but he couldn't
get under the house

37:02.931 --> 37:04.391
until the extractor arrived.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.518
Extractor?
What's an extractor?

37:06.518 --> 37:08.269
It's a machine
that sucks up all the water.

37:09.312 --> 37:10.480
It was supposed
to be there at 3:00,

37:10.480 --> 37:12.816
which turns out
is code for 5:45.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.025
Oh, I'm so sorry.

37:14.025 --> 37:15.110
Why didn't you call me?

37:15.110 --> 37:16.444
So, while I was waiting,

37:16.444 --> 37:17.779
I went online
and I looked up "water damage",

37:17.779 --> 37:18.988
which reads like

37:18.988 --> 37:20.907
a Stephen King novel
for a homeowner.

37:20.907 --> 37:22.158
So, then I went downstairs,

37:22.158 --> 37:24.035
and I started bailing
the water out myself,

37:24.035 --> 37:24.994
and I pulled my back out.

37:26.913 --> 37:27.789
I'm so sorry.

37:30.208 --> 37:31.418
Roses and candles.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.336
Yeah, and a new dress.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.425
Sweetie, you look so pretty.

37:54.399 --> 37:56.317
We're having a baby.

38:06.453 --> 38:07.996
Mason wants me to cut
half the text

38:07.996 --> 38:09.998
describing each piece of lace.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.374
So, I guess people
can just guess

38:11.374 --> 38:13.376
who wore what, when,
and its cultural significance.

38:13.376 --> 38:15.128
Well, he's making
some other changes around here.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.796
Big changes.

38:16.796 --> 38:18.131
Like what?

38:18.131 --> 38:20.800
Well, he's trying to acquire
more modern pieces,

38:20.800 --> 38:22.302
and he wants to replace

38:22.302 --> 38:24.554
some of the older paintings
that are already on display.

38:24.554 --> 38:26.306
We better not be talking about
"Portrait of a Bride".

38:26.306 --> 38:27.182
That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

38:27.182 --> 38:28.308
What?

38:28.308 --> 38:29.684
But not until
after your exhibit.

38:29.684 --> 38:31.436
Is he planning on moving it
back to the basement?

38:31.436 --> 38:35.398
No, he's trying to exchange
five of our paintings

38:35.398 --> 38:36.566
from that museum in London

38:36.566 --> 38:38.068
with five of their paintings,

38:38.068 --> 38:39.486
but I'm not supposed
to say anything,

38:39.486 --> 38:41.112
so don't tell anyone?

38:41.112 --> 38:42.322
This is so wrong.

38:42.322 --> 38:43.365
I can't even find the words.

38:44.866 --> 38:45.867
I mean, I can't find the words
to say anything these days,

38:45.867 --> 38:47.202
or the time or the place
to say it--

38:47.202 --> 38:48.244
and you know what--
there are some things

38:48.244 --> 38:48.870
that just really need
to be said!

38:51.206 --> 38:52.749
Just don't say
anything to Mason.

38:54.084 --> 38:55.377
Of course. Sorry.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.761
Okay, Mom.
Talk soon.

39:08.556 --> 39:09.766
Just got off the phone
with my mother.

39:09.766 --> 39:11.685
Her and Clark
are having a lovely time

39:11.685 --> 39:12.894
and they decided
to extend their stay.

39:14.187 --> 39:16.106
Well, Peter, I'm happy for her,

39:16.106 --> 39:17.857
and you should be, too.

39:17.857 --> 39:18.942
I mean, he's--

39:18.942 --> 39:20.026
he's a pediatrician.

39:20.026 --> 39:21.111
He's not a gold digger.

39:21.111 --> 39:22.904
There's more to it
than that, Avery.

39:22.904 --> 39:24.698
Is this a bad time, folks?

39:24.698 --> 39:26.950
No, Sam, it's a--
it's a fantastic time.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.243
What is it?

39:28.243 --> 39:30.245
I've got some good news
and some bad news.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.580
Okay, why don't we start
with the good news?

39:32.580 --> 39:34.499
Well, we replaced
the pipe in the basement

39:34.499 --> 39:35.625
and it's completely dry.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.752
Okay...

39:37.752 --> 39:38.753
The bad news is

39:38.753 --> 39:40.046
we found a crack
in the foundation.

39:40.046 --> 39:41.589
Oh, come on.
Come on!

39:41.589 --> 39:42.966
Okay, it's not that bad.

39:42.966 --> 39:43.967
Yes, it is that bad!

39:43.967 --> 39:45.301
No, we'll fix it.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.636
Why is the bad news

39:46.636 --> 39:49.597
always so much worse
than the good news is good?

39:49.597 --> 39:51.599
When did you start seeing
the glass as half-empty?

39:51.599 --> 39:52.809
It's not empty, Avery.

39:52.809 --> 39:53.685
It's cracked!

39:57.939 --> 39:58.815
Avery, I...

40:02.652 --> 40:03.820
Avery!

40:05.572 --> 40:06.906
Avery, come on.

40:08.283 --> 40:09.784
Avery, I'm--
I'm sorry.

40:09.784 --> 40:11.536
I don't want you
to be sorry.

40:12.954 --> 40:14.122
I want you to be happy.

40:15.498 --> 40:16.416
I want you to be as happy
as you've ever been

40:16.416 --> 40:17.584
in your whole life.

40:17.584 --> 40:18.918
About the house?
It's falling apart.

40:18.918 --> 40:19.961
No, about the baby

40:19.961 --> 40:21.046
that's going to live
in the house.

40:21.046 --> 40:22.839
What?

40:25.550 --> 40:26.593
I'm-- I'm pregnant.

40:27.969 --> 40:29.471
I've...

40:29.471 --> 40:32.307
I've been trying to tell you
in the most romantic way.

40:32.307 --> 40:33.308
I wanted it to be memorable--

40:33.308 --> 40:34.351
Wait?

40:34.351 --> 40:39.022
I'm gonna be...

40:39.022 --> 40:40.565
I'm gonna be a dad?

40:41.649 --> 40:42.817
Yes.

40:43.902 --> 40:45.904
Yes!

40:45.904 --> 40:47.238
Oh, you wish--

40:47.238 --> 40:48.823
This is the happiest
I've ever been.

40:52.786 --> 40:54.204
I'll never forget this moment.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.458
Oh, my--

40:58.458 --> 41:00.085
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

41:07.592 --> 41:09.719
Mm. I dreamt I was married
to the love of my life

41:09.719 --> 41:11.012
and he woke me up with roses.

41:11.012 --> 41:13.014
And then they had a kid.

41:17.143 --> 41:19.062
I have been having
all of these funny symptoms,

41:19.062 --> 41:21.189
like I have
this crazy sense of smell.

41:21.189 --> 41:23.441
I mean, I can practically tell
what color this rose was

41:23.441 --> 41:25.151
just by its scent.

41:25.151 --> 41:26.861
I can't believe I didn't see
any of these signs.

41:26.861 --> 41:27.987
We can't tell anyone
I'm pregnant.

41:27.987 --> 41:29.197
Not yet.

41:29.197 --> 41:30.490
Most couples wait, you know,

41:30.490 --> 41:31.783
until the end
of the first trimester,

41:31.783 --> 41:32.992
and I think it's a good idea.

41:32.992 --> 41:34.160
Okay.

41:34.160 --> 41:35.495
And by anyone,
I mean everyone.

41:35.495 --> 41:37.497
I got it.
No one.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.707
No one knows
besides you and me.

41:38.707 --> 41:40.792
Except for Emma and Tracy.

41:40.792 --> 41:43.211
Wait, did they know
before I did?

41:43.211 --> 41:44.504
I didn't tell them.

41:44.504 --> 41:46.131
They guessed.
I can't keep anything from them.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.882
I don't want you to keep
anything from me, either.

41:47.882 --> 41:49.175
Aw!

41:49.175 --> 41:52.137
Like how
ridiculously happy I am?

41:52.137 --> 41:53.888
Yeah, stuff like that.

41:53.888 --> 41:55.682
I really don't want
Mason to know.

41:55.682 --> 41:56.975
I mean, he's already
written me off

41:56.975 --> 41:59.394
as the dilettante wife
of a Board member.

41:59.394 --> 42:01.396
Knowing I'm pregnant won't help.

42:01.396 --> 42:02.647
Well, it's gonna be
pretty hard to hide that

42:02.647 --> 42:03.606
in a few months.

42:03.606 --> 42:04.899
I know, I just--

42:04.899 --> 42:06.359
I wanna prove myself, you know?

42:06.359 --> 42:08.111
Before all he sees
is my baby bump.

42:08.111 --> 42:10.155
I can't think of
a more beautiful sight.

42:10.155 --> 42:11.573
Aw...

42:11.573 --> 42:13.908
and you're the father,
not my employer.

42:13.908 --> 42:15.785
No, I'm the luckiest
man in the world is what I am

42:15.785 --> 42:17.495
But you can't tell
anybody why...

42:17.495 --> 42:18.913
- Mm-'kay.
- Not yet.

42:18.913 --> 42:19.914
All right.

42:23.543 --> 42:24.794
Hey, Sam, how are ya?

42:24.794 --> 42:26.338
I'm good.

42:26.338 --> 42:28.840
We still need to talk about
that crack in the foundation.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.633
Oh, yeah, you know what?
I'm fine with it.

42:30.633 --> 42:33.261
Well, you might be fine,
but the crack isn't.

42:33.261 --> 42:35.347
Sam, in the grand scheme
of things,

42:35.347 --> 42:36.556
it's just a crack.

42:36.556 --> 42:37.766
Come on, it's all
about perspective.

42:37.766 --> 42:39.100
My perspective
is to get that thing sealed.

42:40.435 --> 42:41.144
Then that's
what we're gonna do.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.270
Have a good morning!

43:04.417 --> 43:05.794
<i>Guess where I am?</i>

43:05.794 --> 43:07.462
Where?

43:07.462 --> 43:08.630
<i>My favorite room
in the whole house.</i>

43:08.630 --> 43:10.298
My favorite room
in the whole world...

43:10.298 --> 43:11.424
the nursery.

43:11.424 --> 43:13.843
You have a nursery already?

43:13.843 --> 43:15.136
No, I mean, right now,

43:15.136 --> 43:16.429
it's just a really overcrowded
storage room,

43:16.429 --> 43:17.347
but it's gonna be beautiful.

43:17.347 --> 43:18.556
Wait, you told Peter?

43:18.556 --> 43:20.266
- I did.
<i>- Yes!</i>

43:20.266 --> 43:21.476
Tracy needs to know about this.

43:21.476 --> 43:22.644
Hold on.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.649
I don't have much time.
I have to walk into a meeting.

43:27.649 --> 43:29.025
<i>Avery told Peter.</i>

43:31.194 --> 43:32.654
How did it go?

43:32.654 --> 43:34.572
Well, nothing went
according to plan.

43:34.572 --> 43:35.990
I mean we had a flood,
we had a fight,

43:35.990 --> 43:38.618
I ended up just blurting it out
in the backyard...

43:38.618 --> 43:39.953
and, you guys, it was perfect.

43:39.953 --> 43:42.789
<i>We're as close
as we've ever been.</i>

43:42.789 --> 43:43.957
<i>Having a baby, it's--</i>

43:43.957 --> 43:45.625
It's almost like
having the veil.

43:45.625 --> 43:47.210
It just brings...

43:47.210 --> 43:48.336
the truest kind of love.

43:49.421 --> 43:52.632
Avery...

43:52.632 --> 43:53.883
you're gonna be a family.

43:53.883 --> 43:55.385
Aw.

43:55.385 --> 43:56.678
All right, go back to your day.
I don't want to keep you.

43:56.678 --> 43:58.388
I just-- I wanted to tell you
that he knew,

43:58.388 --> 43:59.806
and also remind you,
please don't tell anyone else

43:59.806 --> 44:01.349
<i>for another few weeks.</i>

44:01.349 --> 44:02.559
Mum's the word.

44:02.559 --> 44:04.686
"Mom's" the word!

44:05.562 --> 44:08.481
Emma, that was terrible.

44:08.481 --> 44:09.566
Leave the jokes to me, okay?

44:09.566 --> 44:10.817
Yeah, I love you.

44:12.277 --> 44:14.279
All right.
I love you both.

44:14.279 --> 44:15.530
Avery,

44:15.530 --> 44:16.656
can I show you
something in the kitchen?

44:16.656 --> 44:18.324
Oh, yeah, I'll be right there.

44:19.868 --> 44:21.828
So, what are you going
to do with this room?

44:23.371 --> 44:24.706
Live happily ever after.

44:25.832 --> 44:27.167
Sounds like a plan.

45:06.706 --> 45:07.624
Mm-hmm. Perfect.

45:07.624 --> 45:08.750
Thanks.

45:10.418 --> 45:11.711
Oh, hey, Mrs. H.

45:11.711 --> 45:12.796
Hey, Sam.
How's it going?

45:12.796 --> 45:14.214
Well, it's--

45:14.214 --> 45:15.215
It's coming along.

45:15.215 --> 45:16.466
Yeah.
Is Avery here?

45:16.466 --> 45:18.134
Yeah, she's in her happy place.

45:18.134 --> 45:19.969
Her happy place?

45:19.969 --> 45:21.596
Yeah, that little
spare bedroom upstairs?

45:21.596 --> 45:23.807
She loves it in there.

45:23.807 --> 45:25.266
I'll let her know you're here.

45:37.779 --> 45:39.489
So, tell me,
how was the weekend?

45:41.533 --> 45:43.660
Oh, it was wonderful.

45:43.660 --> 45:45.495
I never wanted it to end.

45:45.495 --> 45:46.955
That's as good
as a review gets.

45:46.955 --> 45:49.749
We're starting to talk about
a future together.

45:49.749 --> 45:52.043
I mean, everything's
moving so fast.

45:52.043 --> 45:54.295
Not just for me,
but for Peter, too.

45:55.755 --> 45:57.048
He'll come around.

45:58.299 --> 46:00.552
Daniel was his idol.

46:00.552 --> 46:02.053
He loomed so large in his life.

46:04.556 --> 46:05.807
He just wants
the best for you.

46:08.852 --> 46:10.687
Well, this sofa
looks just great in here.

46:10.687 --> 46:12.063
It does, right?

46:12.063 --> 46:13.148
I think the family room's
really coming along.

46:13.148 --> 46:14.649
Hey, you're back.

46:14.649 --> 46:15.942
How was your vacation?

46:15.942 --> 46:18.319
Oh, it was lovely, thank you.

46:18.319 --> 46:19.779
I see you got
your paintings framed.

46:19.779 --> 46:21.031
Yeah, well I'm hoping

46:21.031 --> 46:21.948
they're gonna help
sell the program

46:21.948 --> 46:23.158
to the school board.

46:23.158 --> 46:24.284
Do you know that
some of these kids

46:24.284 --> 46:25.285
are just 12 years old?

46:25.285 --> 46:26.494
Amazing.

46:26.494 --> 46:27.454
You know,
the girl that did this,

46:27.454 --> 46:28.788
uh, Maggie?

46:28.788 --> 46:29.998
I was there
when she finished this painting.

46:29.998 --> 46:32.167
You should have seen
the look on her face.

46:32.167 --> 46:33.335
Aw, you should see
the look on your face.

46:36.963 --> 46:38.423
You know, I should--

46:38.423 --> 46:40.050
I should get the kids
to come with me to the meeting.

46:40.050 --> 46:41.885
They say more
than I ever could.

46:41.885 --> 46:43.011
That's a really good idea.

46:43.011 --> 46:44.596
Yeah.

46:45.847 --> 46:47.807
- Oh, thank you, Grace.
- What for?

46:47.807 --> 46:49.601
For raising a son
who loves kids.

46:49.601 --> 46:51.019
I couldn't think of
a better quality.

46:51.019 --> 46:52.979
Aw, neither could I.

46:55.065 --> 46:56.066
Stop.

46:59.110 --> 47:01.196
Italian neoclassical artists
of that era

47:01.196 --> 47:04.366
were so literal and predictable.

47:04.366 --> 47:05.784
I wanna be surprised.

47:05.784 --> 47:07.660
And I wanna be moved.

47:07.660 --> 47:09.204
Yeah, well, I realize

47:09.204 --> 47:11.247
that you have a personal
connection with the painting.

47:11.247 --> 47:12.791
But it also happens
to be very good,

47:12.791 --> 47:14.209
and I'm not the only one
with that opinion.

47:14.209 --> 47:16.378
And yet attendance remains low.

47:18.380 --> 47:21.091
I'm afraid that "The Bride"
is past her prime.

47:21.091 --> 47:22.634
I think she's so beautiful.

47:22.634 --> 47:24.803
In this instance,

47:24.803 --> 47:27.889
beauty is in the eye
of the Executive Director.

47:27.889 --> 47:30.308
I'm negotiating a trade
with another museum.

47:30.308 --> 47:32.018
They have
some really striking pieces

47:32.018 --> 47:33.561
that could generate
real excitement.

47:34.688 --> 47:35.772
Hey, who knows?

47:35.772 --> 47:37.232
You might even like them.

47:38.400 --> 47:39.401
Maybe so.

47:53.707 --> 47:54.708
Thanks for calling me back.

47:54.708 --> 47:57.043
So, how are you feeling?

47:57.043 --> 47:58.628
<i>Well, my clothes
are getting tighter.</i>

47:58.628 --> 48:00.046
That's probably because of

48:00.046 --> 48:01.715
all the pineapple pizza
I can't seem to stop eating.

48:01.715 --> 48:03.216
I need your advice.

48:03.216 --> 48:04.926
<i>Well, if it's
pregnancy-related,</i>

48:04.926 --> 48:05.927
you've got the wrong number.

48:05.927 --> 48:07.053
<i>No, it's about Mason.</i>

48:07.053 --> 48:08.471
I don't know how to handle him.

48:08.471 --> 48:10.765
I feel like
every single thing I do or say,

48:10.765 --> 48:12.058
it just seems to make it worse.

48:12.058 --> 48:13.810
It is not you.
It's him.

48:13.810 --> 48:15.895
That guy is an egomaniac.

48:15.895 --> 48:17.397
<i>He wants to replace the Amici</i>

48:17.397 --> 48:19.274
<i>with something shiny and new
from some other museum.</i>

48:19.274 --> 48:21.067
<i>I don't know how to stop him.</i>

48:21.067 --> 48:22.569
Okay, well, listen to me.

48:22.569 --> 48:25.196
Mason Sylvester wouldn't know
good art from bad.

48:25.196 --> 48:26.406
<i>All he cares about is</i>

48:26.406 --> 48:27.949
<i>if it's selling,
or getting interest...</i>

48:27.949 --> 48:30.910
He doesn't know anything.

48:30.910 --> 48:32.912
I wish I could help you.

48:32.912 --> 48:34.122
Just talking it out helps.

48:34.122 --> 48:35.457
I mean, I love my job,

48:35.457 --> 48:36.916
but I feel like
he is making it impossible

48:36.916 --> 48:38.376
<i>to do my job.</i>

48:38.376 --> 48:39.669
<i>Oh, and, like,
the house is upside-down,</i>

48:39.669 --> 48:40.712
we're trying
to finish it in time--

48:40.712 --> 48:41.629
and did I mention
I'm having a baby?

48:42.839 --> 48:43.923
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

48:43.923 --> 48:45.008
I didn't mean
to go off like that.

48:45.008 --> 48:46.509
<i>You have a job to do
and so do I.</i>

48:46.509 --> 48:49.179
Yeah, of course.

48:49.179 --> 48:50.305
Love you!
Talk soon.

48:50.305 --> 48:51.556
Thanks.

48:58.938 --> 48:59.898
I just spoke with Avery.

48:59.898 --> 49:01.900
Aw, how's she doing?

49:01.900 --> 49:03.985
<i>Not good.</i>

49:03.985 --> 49:05.779
Why, what's wrong?

49:05.779 --> 49:07.280
I'm not sure,

49:07.280 --> 49:08.365
but she needs back-up
and a phone call is not enough.

49:10.283 --> 49:11.743
Then I guess
we're going to Boston.

49:11.743 --> 49:12.744
<i>We're going to Boston.</i>

49:21.294 --> 49:23.880
I don't know
about the lighting in here...

49:23.880 --> 49:25.256
And you're gonna use
that mannequin?

49:27.258 --> 49:28.968
What are you doing here?

49:28.968 --> 49:31.304
Where else would we be?

49:31.304 --> 49:33.682
The first to get married
and the first to be a mom.

49:33.682 --> 49:34.974
No one knows
about the baby yet.

49:34.974 --> 49:36.059
We can't say anything.

49:36.059 --> 49:37.394
Well, you're going to have to

49:37.394 --> 49:38.978
tamp down on that pregnancy glow
you have going on.

49:38.978 --> 49:40.522
It's the hormones.
They're making me crazy.

49:42.691 --> 49:44.025
Oh, Avery, this is beautiful!

49:46.528 --> 49:49.239
This whole lace exhibit
is just wall-to-wall history.

49:49.239 --> 49:50.532
You know, it's funny,

49:50.532 --> 49:52.951
all these countries
had so many grievances,

49:52.951 --> 49:56.162
but they had something
so beautiful in common.

49:56.162 --> 49:58.206
You know what?
I should put that on the wall.

49:58.206 --> 49:59.332
Well, your timing is perfect.

49:59.332 --> 50:00.458
I was just doing
all the Italian lace.

50:00.458 --> 50:02.752
This lucky lady
gets to wear the veil?

50:02.752 --> 50:03.878
Yes, she does.

50:03.878 --> 50:06.131
She's probably
gonna fall in love.

50:06.131 --> 50:07.549
Maybe her soulmate
will have a body.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.510
It always just knocks me out,
it's so beautiful.

50:11.720 --> 50:12.554
Oh, Avery...

50:15.974 --> 50:17.308
- Tracy!
- Mason.

50:17.308 --> 50:20.061
Well, this is a nice surprise.

50:20.061 --> 50:21.855
Uh, Mason is our new

50:21.855 --> 50:23.898
Executive Director
at the Museum.

50:23.898 --> 50:25.525
And this is our dear friend,
Emma Di Stéfano.

50:25.525 --> 50:26.526
How do you do?

50:26.526 --> 50:27.861
Nice to meet you.

50:27.861 --> 50:29.320
I teach art history

50:29.320 --> 50:30.488
and I just wanted
to congratulate you

50:30.488 --> 50:31.948
on this exhibit.

50:31.948 --> 50:34.242
It's as educational
as it is beautiful.

50:34.242 --> 50:35.827
I'm glad that you approve.

50:37.579 --> 50:38.705
This is the veil, is it?

50:38.705 --> 50:39.998
The one you wore
at your wedding?

50:39.998 --> 50:41.207
Yes, it is.

50:41.207 --> 50:42.167
Isn't it just exquisite?

50:43.251 --> 50:44.544
It's very nice, yeah.

50:44.544 --> 50:48.173
I actually researched
its provenance in Italy

50:48.173 --> 50:50.091
and it truly is a museum piece.

50:51.384 --> 50:52.469
You didn't wear it
at your wedding, did you?

50:54.721 --> 50:55.597
I did, actually.

50:56.931 --> 50:58.224
What I think is so amazing

50:58.224 --> 50:59.726
is that Avery has them
here together.

50:59.726 --> 51:01.603
The veil in person

51:01.603 --> 51:03.313
just adds to the value
of Amici's painting.

51:04.773 --> 51:05.732
You, too?

51:06.816 --> 51:07.859
Yes, I did.

51:10.153 --> 51:11.821
Well, that would explain
your enthusiasm

51:11.821 --> 51:13.865
for this particular
piece of lace.

51:15.909 --> 51:18.119
Ah, Flora Crawford.

51:18.119 --> 51:20.246
This is the hottest artist
in the UK.

51:21.831 --> 51:23.750
It was a pleasure
to meet you...?

51:23.750 --> 51:24.834
- Emma.
- Emma!

51:24.834 --> 51:26.002
Emma!

51:26.002 --> 51:27.253
And Tracy...

51:27.253 --> 51:28.463
always a pleasure.

51:28.463 --> 51:31.049
No, stop, please.

51:31.049 --> 51:33.009
The pleasure is...

51:33.009 --> 51:34.594
not mine.

51:36.137 --> 51:38.848
I very much dislike that man.

51:38.848 --> 51:39.849
His arrogance.

51:39.849 --> 51:41.226
That eyebrow.

51:41.226 --> 51:42.268
And is that accent even real?

51:42.268 --> 51:43.853
So, it's not just me?

51:43.853 --> 51:45.230
I'm not just being
overly emotional?

51:45.230 --> 51:46.648
No, definitely not.

51:46.648 --> 51:47.732
I am so sorry.

51:47.732 --> 51:48.858
We came here to help,

51:48.858 --> 51:50.193
but I don't think
we did you much good.

51:50.193 --> 51:51.861
You being here has helped me
more than you know.

51:51.861 --> 51:52.821
Come here.

51:52.821 --> 51:53.822
Oh!

51:58.493 --> 52:00.995
Hi. Is it too late
to get a table for lunch?

52:00.995 --> 52:02.288
Okay, we'll be there. Thanks.

52:02.288 --> 52:04.124
Hey!

52:04.124 --> 52:05.000
I didn't know
you guys were in town.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.292
I didn't either!

52:06.292 --> 52:07.711
They came to lift my spirits.

52:07.711 --> 52:09.212
It was such a good surprise.

52:09.212 --> 52:10.171
I need a hug.

52:10.171 --> 52:11.339
Oh, yeah.
How are ya?

52:11.339 --> 52:12.507
- Hi.
- How are ya doing?

52:12.507 --> 52:14.175
Absolutely not.

52:15.093 --> 52:16.261
I'm just kidding!

52:16.261 --> 52:17.554
Oh, all right.

52:17.554 --> 52:18.638
Sorry.

52:20.181 --> 52:21.683
Wow, fell for that one.

52:21.683 --> 52:23.435
Yeah, you did,

52:23.435 --> 52:24.853
but can you join us for lunch?

52:24.853 --> 52:26.396
Uh, I'd love to,

52:26.396 --> 52:28.815
but my meeting went late
and I gotta go teach my class.

52:28.815 --> 52:30.191
I talked to Wallace, by the way,

52:30.191 --> 52:31.651
about bringing the kids
to the school board.

52:33.028 --> 52:34.821
Speaking of kids...

52:34.821 --> 52:36.072
I am so happy for you two.

52:36.072 --> 52:37.699
You must be so excited.

52:37.699 --> 52:41.161
Oh, yeah, excited,
nervous, hopeful, you know,

52:41.161 --> 52:43.329
you name it,
we're feeling it.

52:43.329 --> 52:45.206
Oh, you sound just like Avery.

52:45.206 --> 52:46.583
But pregnancy looks good
on both of you.

52:47.667 --> 52:48.752
Well...

52:48.752 --> 52:49.794
I draw the line
at pineapple pizza.

52:49.794 --> 52:50.837
What?

52:52.630 --> 52:53.965
You didn't?

52:56.551 --> 52:57.802
Mm.

53:00.180 --> 53:01.348
Mm!

53:02.390 --> 53:04.017
Do you wanna try this?

53:04.017 --> 53:05.352
No, no, I don't.

53:05.352 --> 53:06.728
Watching you is--

53:06.728 --> 53:07.854
...enough.

53:07.854 --> 53:09.356
Mm.

53:12.609 --> 53:13.902
I wake up
in the middle of the night

53:13.902 --> 53:15.320
craving this pizza.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.529
Really, I do.

53:16.529 --> 53:18.073
I mean, I go
from nauseous to starving,

53:18.073 --> 53:19.491
and then crying,

53:19.491 --> 53:20.367
because it all
just reminds me

53:20.367 --> 53:21.368
that I'm gonna be a mom.

53:21.368 --> 53:22.911
Oh!

53:22.911 --> 53:24.079
That was even more touching

53:24.079 --> 53:27.707
with this tomato sauce
on your face.

53:27.707 --> 53:29.250
Thank you.

53:30.418 --> 53:32.420
I do really wish
my mom was here for all this.

53:33.546 --> 53:34.547
Avery.

53:34.547 --> 53:36.007
Thank you for always being here.

53:36.007 --> 53:36.883
Any time.

53:36.883 --> 53:38.051
Anywhere.

53:38.051 --> 53:39.010
Yeah.

53:40.595 --> 53:41.846
Mario!

53:41.846 --> 53:43.306
Hey, you remember my friends,
Tracy and Emma?

53:43.306 --> 53:45.100
- Yes, good to see you.
- Hi.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.351
So...

53:46.351 --> 53:47.602
did Peter like the new car?

53:48.937 --> 53:50.188
He loved it...

53:50.188 --> 53:51.523
You got a new car?

53:51.523 --> 53:53.733
- Yeah.
- What'd you get?

53:53.733 --> 53:54.651
A minivan.

53:54.651 --> 53:55.777
Fancy.

53:57.112 --> 53:58.738
Enjoy your meal.

53:58.738 --> 54:00.281
Thanks.

54:01.783 --> 54:03.326
Okay, so, guys,
there is no minivan.

54:03.326 --> 54:04.994
It's a whole story
that I had to make up

54:04.994 --> 54:06.413
when I made the reservation for
Peter and I to have dinner here

54:06.413 --> 54:07.622
because I didn't want
Mario to know about the baby

54:07.622 --> 54:09.040
before Peter did.

54:10.291 --> 54:11.543
Did you follow that?

54:11.543 --> 54:12.752
Were we supposed
to follow that?

54:12.752 --> 54:14.462
I'm sorry.

54:14.462 --> 54:15.714
I know, I know, it's weird.

54:15.714 --> 54:17.340
It's just--
You know, it's pregnancy logic.

54:17.340 --> 54:18.383
You know what,

54:18.383 --> 54:19.801
you're doing great
with the nausea,

54:19.801 --> 54:21.094
and the hormones...

54:21.094 --> 54:22.804
You really are,

54:22.804 --> 54:24.264
and you're going to do great
with the diapers, too.

54:24.264 --> 54:25.765
I'm just gonna
be the fun aunt.

54:25.765 --> 54:27.475
Speaking of aunts,

54:27.475 --> 54:30.270
I wanted to ask you guys...

54:30.270 --> 54:31.563
if you would both...

54:31.563 --> 54:33.148
be the baby's Godmothers?

54:33.148 --> 54:34.357
Oh...

54:34.357 --> 54:35.650
- Can you have two?
- Can we both do it?

54:35.650 --> 54:38.319
Yeah, I had
two Maids of Honor,

54:38.319 --> 54:40.071
so, of course,
I'm gonna have two Godmothers,

54:40.071 --> 54:42.449
when you have two best friends
that you love so much.

54:42.449 --> 54:44.284
Mm, don't go all Avery on me.

54:44.284 --> 54:46.119
No, no,
go as Avery as you want.

54:46.119 --> 54:47.954
- Aw...
- Yes.

54:47.954 --> 54:49.914
Yes? The answer is yes?

54:49.914 --> 54:51.082
Okay.

54:51.082 --> 54:52.959
Hey, there you are!

54:55.462 --> 54:56.963
What are you doing out here?

54:56.963 --> 54:58.798
I just needed some air.

54:58.798 --> 55:01.009
This morning sickness
is no joke,

55:01.009 --> 55:02.385
and it's not just
in the morning.

55:02.385 --> 55:04.554
I mean, it hits me
on and off all day.

55:04.554 --> 55:06.139
I can't wait
until we can tell people,

55:06.139 --> 55:07.724
when the first trimester
is over.

55:07.724 --> 55:09.976
Yeah, it is getting
a bit awkward, isn't it?

55:09.976 --> 55:11.519
Sam can't seem
to figure us out.

55:11.519 --> 55:13.646
I know, but I feel like
we're lying to people,

55:13.646 --> 55:15.106
which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

55:15.106 --> 55:16.983
Maybe we should
just get a minivan?

55:16.983 --> 55:18.193
Why?

55:18.193 --> 55:20.028
Why would we do that?

55:20.028 --> 55:22.447
Well, I told Mario the big news
was buying a new car.

55:22.447 --> 55:23.406
I didn't want to tell him
I was pregnant,

55:23.406 --> 55:24.407
because you didn't know yet,

55:24.407 --> 55:25.492
and he asked about the car

55:25.492 --> 55:26.993
and I just...
said it was a minivan.

55:26.993 --> 55:28.703
So, wait.

55:28.703 --> 55:30.372
Now we have to get a minivan?

55:30.372 --> 55:31.414
Well, that way,
it will be the truth.

55:32.499 --> 55:33.833
Why couldn't you just tell him

55:33.833 --> 55:35.502
it was something cool,
like a Jeep or something?

55:35.502 --> 55:37.170
There's nothing cooler
on the road to a new mom

55:37.170 --> 55:38.088
than a minivan.

55:41.925 --> 55:43.635
All right.

55:43.635 --> 55:45.261
If you wanna get a minivan,
we'll--

55:45.261 --> 55:46.721
we'll get a minivan.

55:46.721 --> 55:48.014
Thank you.

55:48.014 --> 55:49.974
You know,
the first day we met,

55:49.974 --> 55:50.975
I called you "gallant".

55:50.975 --> 55:52.185
Do you remember that?

55:52.185 --> 55:53.728
Vividly and forever.

55:55.063 --> 55:56.314
I don't know

55:56.314 --> 55:57.107
that I actually knew
what that meant, though,

55:57.107 --> 55:58.233
until now.

55:58.233 --> 56:00.443
What does it mean to you?

56:00.443 --> 56:01.861
That you're going to be
as good to our kid

56:01.861 --> 56:02.904
as you are to me.

56:05.532 --> 56:07.492
I'm going to be a dad--

56:07.492 --> 56:10.286
which is just--

56:10.286 --> 56:14.290
I-- I grew up
in the shadow of a giant,

56:14.290 --> 56:15.792
and I feel like

56:15.792 --> 56:17.127
I'm still trying to figure out
who I am,

56:17.127 --> 56:18.545
but...

56:18.545 --> 56:20.213
but now I have a deadline

56:20.213 --> 56:23.008
because-- because
I'm gonna be a father.

56:24.676 --> 56:26.302
I know.

56:26.302 --> 56:27.762
I've been thinking about
my mom a lot, too.

56:29.597 --> 56:30.765
I wanna get this right.

56:32.350 --> 56:33.685
Me too.

56:47.824 --> 56:48.742
Lucy said you wanted to see me.

56:48.742 --> 56:50.577
Yes.

56:50.577 --> 56:52.287
Would you like a cup of coffee?
I just made it.

56:52.287 --> 56:53.747
No, thank you.
I'm good.

56:53.747 --> 56:54.748
Now, there is something
that I wanted to show you--

56:54.748 --> 56:56.124
something
I'm very excited about,

56:56.124 --> 56:56.916
and I hope that you are, too.

56:56.916 --> 56:58.001
Great.

56:58.001 --> 56:58.918
Yeah, follow me.

57:03.631 --> 57:05.800
Well,
it arrived this morning.

57:05.800 --> 57:07.552
Gosh, I've been chasing
this piece for years.

57:07.552 --> 57:09.137
It's a Crawford,
of course.

57:09.137 --> 57:10.388
Are you familiar
with her work?

57:10.388 --> 57:12.307
Yes, I am.

57:12.307 --> 57:13.350
It's called "Rush Hour".

57:13.350 --> 57:14.684
Ah, this--

57:14.684 --> 57:16.436
This is art that speaks to me.

57:16.436 --> 57:18.271
It's-- It's--

57:18.271 --> 57:20.273
It's very, um...

57:20.273 --> 57:21.566
It's striking.

57:21.566 --> 57:24.361
The urgency
of the brush strokes

57:24.361 --> 57:27.322
conveying a frustration
with modern life.

57:27.322 --> 57:29.240
It's--

57:29.240 --> 57:30.408
You don't like it?

57:30.408 --> 57:31.659
No, I-- I do.

57:32.702 --> 57:35.455
You don't look
like you like it.

57:35.455 --> 57:36.956
No, I'm just really--

57:36.956 --> 57:37.999
just really absorbing it.

57:41.836 --> 57:45.215
You know, you might prefer
romance and lace,

57:45.215 --> 57:46.132
but what hangs on these walls,

57:46.132 --> 57:47.175
that is up to me.

57:48.510 --> 57:50.804
Of course.

57:50.804 --> 57:52.555
It's a Crawford.

57:52.555 --> 57:53.890
It's unbelievable.

58:01.648 --> 58:03.483
How are ya feeling?

58:03.483 --> 58:04.984
I can't have another day
like the last,

58:04.984 --> 58:06.903
so I picked up
some of these wrist things.

58:06.903 --> 58:08.321
Why? What are they
supposed to do?

58:08.321 --> 58:09.656
I don't know.

58:09.656 --> 58:10.990
It's this band,
it hits a pressure point...

58:10.990 --> 58:12.659
It's supposed to help
with the morning sickness.

58:12.659 --> 58:14.744
Dr. Hawthorne's nurse
recommended them.

58:14.744 --> 58:16.496
It's not exactly
a fashion statement,

58:16.496 --> 58:19.499
but hopefully, it'll help me
get through the day.

58:19.499 --> 58:20.709
When is your meeting
with the Board?

58:20.709 --> 58:21.835
10:30.

58:21.835 --> 58:23.628
Assuming they don't
postpone it again.

58:23.628 --> 58:25.005
Wallace said that

58:25.005 --> 58:25.922
they didn't see the point
of bringing the kids,

58:25.922 --> 58:26.881
but he insisted.

58:28.633 --> 58:29.926
You know what?

58:29.926 --> 58:31.052
You're gonna be great
and so are the kids.

58:31.052 --> 58:33.304
You always look
so handsome in a suit.

58:33.304 --> 58:34.347
Well, you look
gorgeous in anything.

58:34.347 --> 58:35.849
Thank you.

58:35.849 --> 58:36.891
I'm gonna need some
maternity clothes soon, though.

58:36.891 --> 58:38.768
I feel like
I'm about to pop a seam.

58:38.768 --> 58:39.936
Well...

58:39.936 --> 58:41.521
do I look as nervous as I feel?

58:41.521 --> 58:43.106
You look like a guy

58:43.106 --> 58:45.817
who is about to do a lot of good
for a whole lot of kids.

58:47.068 --> 58:48.194
You hear that?

58:48.194 --> 58:49.571
She says you're good,

58:49.571 --> 58:51.364
so get over yourself
and get out there and do it.

58:51.364 --> 58:52.365
That's right.

58:52.365 --> 58:53.491
Be nice to him.

58:53.491 --> 58:54.826
He's the father of my baby.

59:00.540 --> 59:02.083
I can't wait.

59:03.376 --> 59:04.169
Can't wait for what?

59:05.378 --> 59:06.921
Uh, hi!

59:06.921 --> 59:08.298
I can't--

59:08.298 --> 59:10.216
I can't wait
for the exhibit to open.

59:10.216 --> 59:12.302
I'm sure it'll be
very exciting.

59:12.302 --> 59:15.096
You know, I first saw
Crawford's work at the Met,

59:15.096 --> 59:17.682
and she's challenging,
and dynamic, and...

59:17.682 --> 59:18.975
I understand
what you see in her.

59:20.602 --> 59:22.020
Well, that's hardly
a ringing endorsement.

59:22.020 --> 59:22.979
It's a sincere one.

59:24.981 --> 59:26.024
What's with the--

59:26.024 --> 59:26.983
the wristband there?

59:26.983 --> 59:28.318
What?

59:28.318 --> 59:29.652
Oh, oh, the wristband?

59:29.652 --> 59:30.487
This-- This--
This wristband?

59:30.487 --> 59:32.697
I-- I--

59:32.697 --> 59:34.032
You know what?

59:34.032 --> 59:36.576
My tennis instructor
suggested that I wear it.

59:36.576 --> 59:38.495
Well, you know
how tennis elbow is a thing?

59:38.495 --> 59:40.246
Well, I get tennis wrist.

59:40.246 --> 59:41.873
Tennis wrist?
Is that a thing?

59:41.873 --> 59:43.208
- Totally a thing, yeah.
- Really?

59:43.208 --> 59:44.584
I wear it,

59:44.584 --> 59:46.127
and it just helps support me
while I'm doing my--

59:46.127 --> 59:47.504
You know, these little exercises
to help build it up.

59:47.504 --> 59:49.172
Oh.

59:49.172 --> 59:50.423
Looks great in here.

59:50.423 --> 59:51.841
Hello, Peter.

59:51.841 --> 59:52.842
Do you play tennis as well?

59:53.927 --> 59:56.262
Uh, yeah, remember
I was just saying

59:56.262 --> 59:59.557
that I was wearing the band
to help with my wrist?

59:59.557 --> 1:00:00.850
I thought that was--

1:00:00.850 --> 1:00:02.102
For when I play--
No. When I play tennis.

1:00:02.102 --> 1:00:03.103
This helps my weak wrist?

1:00:03.103 --> 1:00:04.979
Right. Yeah, when she's--

1:00:04.979 --> 1:00:07.982
- She's a big tennis player.
- Yeah. All the time.

1:00:07.982 --> 1:00:09.317
I play.

1:00:09.317 --> 1:00:10.777
Oh.

1:00:10.777 --> 1:00:13.196
Some say I put the Ace
into Mason.

1:00:13.196 --> 1:00:15.198
We should totally play
doubles sometime?

1:00:15.198 --> 1:00:16.533
- Sure.
- Sure, yeah.

1:00:16.533 --> 1:00:17.826
Yeah, as soon as
I build up the wrist.

1:00:17.826 --> 1:00:18.952
Yeah... Ah, the wrist.

1:00:18.952 --> 1:00:20.036
Great!

1:00:20.036 --> 1:00:21.454
We would have
done it now, but...

1:00:21.454 --> 1:00:23.331
I'd love
to stick around and chat,

1:00:23.331 --> 1:00:25.625
but I have a conference call.

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:26.876
It's always a pleasure, Peter.

1:00:26.876 --> 1:00:28.294
Oh, yeah.

1:00:28.294 --> 1:00:29.462
I'll see ya on the court.

1:00:29.462 --> 1:00:31.089
Oh, you bet!

1:00:31.089 --> 1:00:33.174
- Ohh...
- 15-Love.

1:00:33.174 --> 1:00:34.426
Wow.

1:00:34.426 --> 1:00:35.677
- Okay, that was awkward.
- I caught it.

1:00:37.512 --> 1:00:38.596
How was the meeting?

1:00:38.596 --> 1:00:41.391
Good, yeah.

1:00:41.391 --> 1:00:42.642
They don't vote until next week,

1:00:42.642 --> 1:00:43.810
but Wallace says it's--
it's looking good.

1:00:43.810 --> 1:00:45.812
Aw, I'm so happy for you.

1:00:45.812 --> 1:00:47.814
Well, wait until
it's official.

1:00:47.814 --> 1:00:50.859
I don't have to wait for this.

1:00:50.859 --> 1:00:53.028
Mm...

1:00:58.825 --> 1:01:00.827
Aw, look at that.

1:01:00.827 --> 1:01:02.370
Right under the Amici,
where you proposed.

1:01:03.955 --> 1:01:05.373
That feels like
a lifetime ago...

1:01:07.459 --> 1:01:08.793
And then there were three.

1:01:23.183 --> 1:01:24.559
What do you think about these
for curtains?

1:01:24.559 --> 1:01:26.227
Uh, yeah... That's fine.

1:01:27.854 --> 1:01:28.980
Well, you didn't even look.

1:01:31.066 --> 1:01:32.233
I've got other concerns
about the house.

1:01:32.233 --> 1:01:33.401
Like what?

1:01:33.401 --> 1:01:34.736
Well, I've been
reading about it,

1:01:34.736 --> 1:01:35.945
and I think since
we're redoing the foundation,

1:01:35.945 --> 1:01:36.988
we should retrofit the house
for earthquakes.

1:01:36.988 --> 1:01:38.448
We never have earthquakes here.

1:01:38.448 --> 1:01:39.783
Exactly.

1:01:39.783 --> 1:01:41.993
So, we're overdue for one.

1:01:41.993 --> 1:01:43.661
You focus on the decorating,
I'll focus on the protecting.

1:01:43.661 --> 1:01:44.704
Well, I'm nesting.

1:01:44.704 --> 1:01:46.039
I'm protecting.

1:01:46.039 --> 1:01:47.499
Are we fighting?
I don't-- I don't want to fight.

1:01:47.499 --> 1:01:48.708
We never fight.

1:01:48.708 --> 1:01:50.251
We're not--
We're not fighting.

1:01:52.837 --> 1:01:54.631
Our lives are about to change,

1:01:54.631 --> 1:01:56.883
and we're just...

1:01:56.883 --> 1:01:58.510
we're just figuring it out
as we go along.

1:01:58.510 --> 1:02:01.137
I know, but I don't want
our relationship to change.

1:02:01.137 --> 1:02:02.180
The romance...

1:02:02.180 --> 1:02:04.599
Romance?
What are you talking about?

1:02:04.599 --> 1:02:05.767
We were just kissing
at the thing?

1:02:07.185 --> 1:02:08.269
Why did you stop
waking me up with roses?

1:02:10.939 --> 1:02:12.732
I guess I thought
that roses and morning sickness

1:02:12.732 --> 1:02:15.735
were kind of contradictory.

1:02:15.735 --> 1:02:17.987
We just have to always
make time for each other,

1:02:17.987 --> 1:02:18.905
you know?

1:02:18.905 --> 1:02:20.156
Flowers, and date nights,

1:02:20.156 --> 1:02:23.451
and those glances
across a crowded room.

1:02:25.954 --> 1:02:27.163
Does the room
have to be crowded?

1:02:30.709 --> 1:02:31.835
Oh, my...

1:02:33.628 --> 1:02:35.547
At least we know you're gonna
be really good at the Dad Jokes.

1:02:35.547 --> 1:02:36.464
You know it.

1:02:42.637 --> 1:02:45.598
Maybe it's because I'm Irish,

1:02:45.598 --> 1:02:47.851
but I think
the Irish lace is the best.

1:02:49.060 --> 1:02:50.437
Well, I mean, nothing compares
to the veil for me,

1:02:50.437 --> 1:02:51.938
but you know what?

1:02:51.938 --> 1:02:54.607
The Irish lace
is definitely a close second.

1:02:54.607 --> 1:02:55.859
Lucy, there you are.

1:02:56.818 --> 1:02:58.361
Uh, I need you
in the office.

1:02:58.361 --> 1:02:59.946
Yes, that's exactly
where I was just heading.

1:03:01.364 --> 1:03:02.365
Ta.

1:03:02.365 --> 1:03:05.076
Avery... um,

1:03:05.076 --> 1:03:06.286
there's something
that I need to--

1:03:06.286 --> 1:03:07.203
need to tell you.

1:03:09.164 --> 1:03:10.540
It's actually harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:13.209
Well, perhaps
you should just say it?

1:03:14.836 --> 1:03:17.005
I've agreed to the trade.

1:03:17.005 --> 1:03:19.341
Five new paintings
in exchange for five of ours.

1:03:21.134 --> 1:03:22.302
Including
"Portrait of a Bride"?

1:03:23.803 --> 1:03:25.555
Yeah, but not until
after the exhibit.

1:03:29.017 --> 1:03:29.976
I just want to say,
for the record,

1:03:29.976 --> 1:03:31.561
I think this is a huge mistake.

1:03:33.855 --> 1:03:35.315
I'm doing what I believe
is best for the museum.

1:03:51.748 --> 1:03:53.875
So, what do you want to watch?

1:03:53.875 --> 1:03:57.837
Looks like there's a movie
about an art heist.

1:03:57.837 --> 1:04:00.548
Mm, maybe I should
just steal the Amici.

1:04:00.548 --> 1:04:01.508
That would get
Mason's attention.

1:04:03.593 --> 1:04:04.928
Hey, folks.

1:04:04.928 --> 1:04:06.554
The fellas and I
are heading home.

1:04:06.554 --> 1:04:07.931
We'll be back early Monday.

1:04:07.931 --> 1:04:09.224
All right.

1:04:10.767 --> 1:04:11.851
You ever watch this guy?

1:04:11.851 --> 1:04:13.269
Yeah, I like
Fred Carruthers.

1:04:14.479 --> 1:04:15.772
He's the guy who does

1:04:15.772 --> 1:04:17.982
all the historic pieces
on places in Boston.

1:04:17.982 --> 1:04:19.234
Yeah, he did
a really cool story

1:04:19.234 --> 1:04:20.402
about a house I worked on once.

1:04:21.903 --> 1:04:23.113
He's a great guy.

1:04:23.113 --> 1:04:24.489
We hang out
every once in a while.

1:04:24.489 --> 1:04:27.450
Anyways, the Red Sox
are playing the Yankees tonight.

1:04:27.450 --> 1:04:28.535
Who do you like?

1:04:28.535 --> 1:04:29.911
Sox. Always the Sox.

1:04:29.911 --> 1:04:31.746
That is
the right answer, my friend.

1:04:31.746 --> 1:04:33.581
You folks have a great weekend.

1:04:33.581 --> 1:04:35.041
- All right. See ya.
- Thank you.

1:04:38.920 --> 1:04:40.839
You know...

1:04:40.839 --> 1:04:42.257
my father and I,

1:04:42.257 --> 1:04:45.218
we didn't always see
eye to eye on everything, but...

1:04:45.218 --> 1:04:46.970
we never missed a Red Sox game.

1:04:48.930 --> 1:04:50.515
That was kinda our thing.

1:04:51.933 --> 1:04:53.226
Do you think that's why

1:04:53.226 --> 1:04:55.270
you're having such a hard time
accepting Clark?

1:04:57.355 --> 1:04:59.315
Seeing my mother
with somebody new is, uh...

1:05:00.900 --> 1:05:03.737
It's just gonna take
some getting used to,

1:05:03.737 --> 1:05:05.155
and I don't think I'm there yet.

1:05:06.823 --> 1:05:08.533
Yeah.

1:05:08.533 --> 1:05:10.744
So, what's it gonna be?

1:05:10.744 --> 1:05:12.704
Carruthers or the art heist?

1:05:14.664 --> 1:05:15.874
Mm, Carruthers.
Tape the heist.

1:05:15.874 --> 1:05:18.251
All right.

1:05:18.251 --> 1:05:19.461
What do you want for dinner?

1:05:19.461 --> 1:05:21.379
Pineapple pizza.

1:05:21.379 --> 1:05:22.922
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:22.922 --> 1:05:23.965
We could call Mario's.

1:05:23.965 --> 1:05:25.925
Let's take the minivan.

1:05:25.925 --> 1:05:27.635
I'm sure
he's dying to see that.

1:05:39.064 --> 1:05:42.650
You know, there's
a little village in Provence.

1:05:42.650 --> 1:05:45.779
It's the most beautiful place
I've ever seen.

1:05:45.779 --> 1:05:49.157
I'd love to go back there...

1:05:49.157 --> 1:05:51.451
and I'd love to go with you.

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:55.080
Well...

1:05:55.080 --> 1:05:57.207
I have my work
at the Foundation,

1:05:57.207 --> 1:05:59.918
and my family, and...

1:05:59.918 --> 1:06:02.295
It would be hard to get away.

1:06:02.295 --> 1:06:04.631
Well, maybe just for
a few weeks in the summer?

1:06:07.926 --> 1:06:09.594
I'm sorry.

1:06:09.594 --> 1:06:11.346
I can't do this.

1:06:13.932 --> 1:06:16.142
Too much of my heart
still belongs to Daniel

1:06:16.142 --> 1:06:18.395
and I'm not ready to let go...

1:06:21.147 --> 1:06:23.024
...and I have to consider
Peter's feelings.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:26.695
I hope we can
still be friends?

1:06:31.032 --> 1:06:32.367
Of course, Grace.

1:06:46.047 --> 1:06:47.924
Sam thinks we need
to hire a landscaper.

1:06:47.924 --> 1:06:49.968
I want to plant
tons of rose bushes.

1:06:49.968 --> 1:06:52.387
Every color and variety.

1:06:52.387 --> 1:06:54.764
Roses mean a lot
to me and Peter.

1:06:54.764 --> 1:06:56.016
You know what?

1:06:56.016 --> 1:06:58.059
Daniel used to bring me daisies.

1:06:58.059 --> 1:06:59.936
He'd call them
the happiest flower on earth.

1:06:59.936 --> 1:07:01.730
You must really miss him.

1:07:01.730 --> 1:07:03.523
Yeah, I do.

1:07:05.859 --> 1:07:07.402
I told Clark

1:07:07.402 --> 1:07:10.447
that I wasn't ready to feel
the same way about anybody else.

1:07:12.073 --> 1:07:13.033
We'll remain friends,

1:07:13.033 --> 1:07:15.869
but anything more, I think,

1:07:15.869 --> 1:07:17.746
would be too much for me...

1:07:17.746 --> 1:07:18.955
and for Peter.

1:07:18.955 --> 1:07:21.666
Peter really does want
the best for you.

1:07:21.666 --> 1:07:23.710
Well, that's not how it works,

1:07:23.710 --> 1:07:25.837
and you'll understand that
a little bit better

1:07:25.837 --> 1:07:27.255
when you become a mother.

1:07:29.215 --> 1:07:31.217
I want the best for my son.

1:07:31.217 --> 1:07:33.803
His happiness
is everything to me,

1:07:33.803 --> 1:07:35.221
and that's what happens

1:07:35.221 --> 1:07:36.473
when you bring someone
into this world.

1:07:42.103 --> 1:07:44.689
Roses and more roses...

1:07:44.689 --> 1:07:46.232
I think that's a wonderful way
to fill your garden.

1:07:47.317 --> 1:07:50.111
Just plant a few daisies for me.

1:07:58.787 --> 1:08:00.497
Good news.

1:08:00.497 --> 1:08:02.749
Wallace came out and said
it passed by one vote.

1:08:02.749 --> 1:08:03.917
You did it.

1:08:03.917 --> 1:08:05.502
That minivan will be hauling

1:08:05.502 --> 1:08:07.671
art supplies
all around the city now.

1:08:07.671 --> 1:08:09.005
Aw, well, as long as

1:08:09.005 --> 1:08:10.131
there's enough room
for a car seat.

1:08:11.132 --> 1:08:12.258
I can't wait.

1:08:12.258 --> 1:08:14.636
Did you tell your mom
I'm pregnant?

1:08:14.636 --> 1:08:16.179
It's okay if you did.

1:08:16.179 --> 1:08:17.514
No, I didn't.

1:08:17.514 --> 1:08:18.890
Why?

1:08:18.890 --> 1:08:20.100
I saw her today

1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:22.102
and I just got the feeling
she knew.

1:08:22.102 --> 1:08:23.603
Maybe it was just
wishful thinking?

1:08:26.856 --> 1:08:27.982
Why do I feel
like there's more?

1:08:27.982 --> 1:08:32.445
I think
she really cares about Clark,

1:08:32.445 --> 1:08:34.531
but she told him she thought
they should just be friends.

1:08:36.324 --> 1:08:37.701
Honestly, I'm relieved.

1:08:37.701 --> 1:08:39.411
It's making her sad.

1:08:39.411 --> 1:08:40.370
Come on...

1:08:40.370 --> 1:08:41.996
Well, then why would she do it?

1:08:41.996 --> 1:08:43.790
Because of me?

1:08:43.790 --> 1:08:45.458
Well, I think she's conflicted.

1:08:45.458 --> 1:08:47.168
She knows it's hard for you.

1:08:47.168 --> 1:08:48.920
Avery, I can't help
the way I feel.

1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:50.630
I know, I just thought
you should know how she feels,

1:08:50.630 --> 1:08:51.631
that's all.

1:08:51.631 --> 1:08:52.882
Well, now I know.

1:08:56.469 --> 1:08:58.304
I don't want us to fight.

1:09:00.390 --> 1:09:03.476
I'm not fighting with you...

1:09:03.476 --> 1:09:05.562
I'm fighting to hold onto
the memory of my father.

1:09:09.649 --> 1:09:11.276
Lights off.

1:09:23.913 --> 1:09:25.206
I just can't believe

1:09:25.206 --> 1:09:26.499
the Amici won't be
at the Stanbridge anymore.

1:09:26.499 --> 1:09:29.419
It's like the "Mona Lisa"
not being at the Louvre.

1:09:29.419 --> 1:09:31.838
I'm not sure
I could go that far,

1:09:31.838 --> 1:09:33.506
but I know what you mean.

1:09:33.506 --> 1:09:36.384
And things are
so complicated at home.

1:09:36.384 --> 1:09:37.594
Grace broke up with Clark.

1:09:37.594 --> 1:09:39.012
What?

1:09:39.012 --> 1:09:40.221
No...
I thought she was so happy?

1:09:40.221 --> 1:09:42.349
But Peter wasn't,

1:09:42.349 --> 1:09:44.017
and now he's feeling guilty
about it,

1:09:44.017 --> 1:09:46.353
so I feel guilty
for even bringing it up...

1:09:46.353 --> 1:09:47.812
but I can't help the fact

1:09:47.812 --> 1:09:50.106
that I feel like Grace and Clark
are meant to be together.

1:09:50.106 --> 1:09:51.941
Ah, being a romantic
has its downside.

1:09:53.401 --> 1:09:55.445
These lunches are
supposed to be cheering you up.

1:09:55.445 --> 1:09:56.696
<i>I know.</i>

1:09:56.696 --> 1:09:58.323
<i>My emotions are just
all over the place.</i>

1:09:58.323 --> 1:10:00.533
I mean, what's going to happen
when I have the baby?

1:10:00.533 --> 1:10:02.285
Mason complains
if I take a long lunch,

1:10:02.285 --> 1:10:03.745
how's he gonna feel
about maternity leave?

1:10:05.288 --> 1:10:06.331
Speaking of long lunches,

1:10:06.331 --> 1:10:07.624
I should probably
get back to work.

1:10:09.334 --> 1:10:11.628
Uh, I've gotta go.

1:10:13.254 --> 1:10:14.339
You're pregnant?

1:10:16.049 --> 1:10:16.966
Yes.

1:10:18.176 --> 1:10:20.220
Well...

1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:21.304
that explains a lot.

1:10:21.304 --> 1:10:23.973
What does it explain, Mason?

1:10:23.973 --> 1:10:27.310
Why I love a painting so much,
because it moves me?

1:10:27.310 --> 1:10:28.687
Why I so badly
don't want to see it moved

1:10:28.687 --> 1:10:29.896
to some other museum

1:10:29.896 --> 1:10:31.564
when I know it belongs
exactly where it is?

1:10:31.564 --> 1:10:34.984
This is not pregnancy, Mason,
this is--

1:10:34.984 --> 1:10:36.569
This is me knowing I'm right.

1:10:36.569 --> 1:10:39.239
I think that your--
your passion is misplaced.

1:10:39.239 --> 1:10:40.657
I'm proud of how I feel.

1:10:42.033 --> 1:10:43.159
Passion is the essence of art.

1:10:43.159 --> 1:10:44.744
It's what an artist feels

1:10:44.744 --> 1:10:47.205
when they give us
the gift of their talent.

1:10:47.205 --> 1:10:48.123
They don't paint
with their heads,

1:10:48.123 --> 1:10:49.708
they paint with their hearts,

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.418
and that's exactly
how it's meant to be seen!

1:10:55.672 --> 1:10:57.507
And now if you'll excuse me,
I am going to lose my lunch.

1:11:04.347 --> 1:11:05.682
You know what?

1:11:05.682 --> 1:11:07.726
Mason may be my boss,
but he is dead wrong.

1:11:07.726 --> 1:11:09.394
I'm thinking about
taking this over his head.

1:11:09.394 --> 1:11:11.604
You know the Board
can't intervene.

1:11:11.604 --> 1:11:12.689
He insisted on creative control

1:11:12.689 --> 1:11:14.441
as part of a condition
for the job.

1:11:14.441 --> 1:11:15.775
No, I'm talking about
going above the Board.

1:11:15.775 --> 1:11:17.235
Taking it to the donors
and the patrons.

1:11:17.235 --> 1:11:19.029
How are you gonna do that?

1:11:19.029 --> 1:11:20.697
I go public with it.
I get publicity.

1:11:20.697 --> 1:11:22.490
I explain to people
why the Amici matters.

1:11:23.491 --> 1:11:25.535
Um, I was thinking...

1:11:25.535 --> 1:11:27.871
if Mason knows you're pregnant,
we should probably tell my mom.

1:11:27.871 --> 1:11:30.540
I know, and Lucy,

1:11:30.540 --> 1:11:32.208
but we shouldn't tell
anyone else.

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:33.460
Except for Sam,

1:11:33.460 --> 1:11:34.627
because I really want him

1:11:34.627 --> 1:11:36.296
to paint clouds
on the nursery walls,

1:11:36.296 --> 1:11:37.505
and that's probably going
to need an explanation.

1:11:37.505 --> 1:11:38.423
Okay.

1:11:38.423 --> 1:11:39.758
I don't know what to do.

1:11:39.758 --> 1:11:41.426
I feel like the baby's
not even here,

1:11:41.426 --> 1:11:42.802
and I'm already torn between,

1:11:42.802 --> 1:11:45.555
you know, our family,
and my job...

1:11:45.555 --> 1:11:47.474
I think
that's how everybody feels.

1:11:48.850 --> 1:11:50.769
You're going to be
all over town with your program.

1:11:50.769 --> 1:11:54.064
I can't have a baby
running around the museum.

1:11:54.064 --> 1:11:55.940
How...

1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:57.817
How are we gonna do this?
How are we gonna make it work?

1:11:57.817 --> 1:12:00.362
I don't know.

1:12:00.362 --> 1:12:01.821
I've never done this
before, either.

1:12:08.703 --> 1:12:10.246
So, once we finish
everything in here,

1:12:10.246 --> 1:12:11.414
what do you think

1:12:11.414 --> 1:12:13.166
if we put some clouds
on the ceiling?

1:12:13.166 --> 1:12:14.668
Oh, sure thing.

1:12:14.668 --> 1:12:15.710
I'll get my cloud guy
on it right away.

1:12:17.212 --> 1:12:18.296
I'm glad we told you, Sam.

1:12:18.296 --> 1:12:20.674
Hey, I am honored
to be in on your secret.

1:12:20.674 --> 1:12:22.175
Thank you.

1:12:22.175 --> 1:12:25.220
Sam, you said that you know,
uh, Fred Carruthers, right?

1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:26.680
Yeah.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:28.556
How did we just go
from clouds to Carruthers?

1:12:28.556 --> 1:12:30.100
Sorry.

1:12:30.100 --> 1:12:32.227
Do you think there's any way
you could text me his number?

1:12:32.227 --> 1:12:34.270
I really need to speak with him.

1:12:34.270 --> 1:12:35.647
Yeah, I can text it
to you right now.

1:12:37.148 --> 1:12:38.066
By the way, did you make up
your mind on those curtains?

1:12:39.317 --> 1:12:40.527
Uh, yeah, the curtains.

1:12:40.527 --> 1:12:42.195
We were gonna go
with the cream ones, I think?

1:12:42.195 --> 1:12:44.364
Uh, I thought you said blue?

1:12:44.364 --> 1:12:46.199
- Blue?
- Yeah.

1:12:46.199 --> 1:12:47.909
No, we can't do the--

1:12:47.909 --> 1:12:50.078
I don't think blue's gonna work.
Did I say blue?

1:12:50.078 --> 1:12:51.496
I don't know.

1:12:51.496 --> 1:12:53.873
I can't make up my mind
about anything anymore.

1:13:00.296 --> 1:13:01.631
Hey...

1:13:02.966 --> 1:13:04.551
You all right?

1:13:05.635 --> 1:13:06.886
I just want everything
to be so perfect,

1:13:06.886 --> 1:13:09.556
and I feel like
I'm failing on all fronts.

1:13:10.890 --> 1:13:11.683
Well, you're not.

1:13:11.683 --> 1:13:13.893
What, perfect or failing?

1:13:13.893 --> 1:13:15.687
Either one.

1:13:18.189 --> 1:13:19.441
I can't even
figure out the curtains.

1:13:20.608 --> 1:13:21.818
So we'll choose them together.

1:13:23.069 --> 1:13:23.945
One curtain at a time.

1:13:26.656 --> 1:13:28.992
There's one thing
I'm sure of...

1:13:28.992 --> 1:13:30.702
It's you and me.

1:13:39.753 --> 1:13:41.296
All right.

1:13:41.296 --> 1:13:42.714
There's something
I have to do.

1:13:49.137 --> 1:13:50.388
Mr. Carruthers, hi.

1:13:50.388 --> 1:13:52.474
I really appreciate you
taking my call.

1:13:54.642 --> 1:13:56.144
Well, we found
the painting in the basement,

1:13:56.144 --> 1:13:57.562
had it restored,

1:13:57.562 --> 1:13:59.439
and it has been hanging
on the wall ever since.

1:13:59.439 --> 1:14:01.274
My husband actually
proposed to me under it.

1:14:01.274 --> 1:14:02.525
It was very romantic.

1:14:03.985 --> 1:14:05.612
So, if people want to see
Amici's "Portrait of a Bride",

1:14:05.612 --> 1:14:06.946
they better come quickly,

1:14:06.946 --> 1:14:08.907
because it's only here
for eight more weeks,

1:14:08.907 --> 1:14:10.450
along with the veil.

1:14:10.450 --> 1:14:11.951
We have the actual veil

1:14:11.951 --> 1:14:14.662
that the bride is wearing
in the painting.

1:14:14.662 --> 1:14:17.040
How did a wedding veil

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:18.875
in a portrait
painted over a hundred years ago

1:14:18.875 --> 1:14:19.918
wind up here?

1:14:19.918 --> 1:14:21.127
It's a great story.

1:14:21.127 --> 1:14:23.338
My friends and I
found it in an antique shop,

1:14:23.338 --> 1:14:24.714
and we agreed
to buy it together,

1:14:24.714 --> 1:14:25.924
especially when we heard

1:14:25.924 --> 1:14:27.550
there was a legend
attached to the veil.

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:29.511
What kind of legend?

1:14:29.511 --> 1:14:32.722
That whoever possesses the veil
will find true love.

1:14:34.516 --> 1:14:36.226
Did it prove to be true?

1:14:36.226 --> 1:14:37.811
Well, the three of us
fell in love

1:14:37.811 --> 1:14:40.480
and we were all married
wearing the veil...

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:41.690
and it's still working
its magic.

1:14:41.690 --> 1:14:43.024
Really?

1:14:46.653 --> 1:14:47.612
This is incredible.

1:14:47.612 --> 1:14:49.197
I mean,
look at all these people.

1:14:49.197 --> 1:14:50.990
It's more than I even hoped.

1:14:50.990 --> 1:14:53.034
Well, if we put it on TV,
they will come.

1:14:53.034 --> 1:14:54.786
And keep on coming.

1:14:54.786 --> 1:14:57.539
They started lining up
an hour ago.

1:14:57.539 --> 1:14:58.707
Come on, let's finish
getting ready.

1:14:58.707 --> 1:14:59.874
Okay.

1:15:13.972 --> 1:15:16.182
Avery, you have done
a marvelous job.

1:15:16.182 --> 1:15:18.018
Aw, thank you, Grace.

1:15:18.018 --> 1:15:19.728
Mom, the exhibit

1:15:19.728 --> 1:15:20.979
is not the only thing
that we're celebrating tonight.

1:15:20.979 --> 1:15:21.938
Oh?

1:15:24.149 --> 1:15:25.150
We're having a baby.

1:15:26.484 --> 1:15:27.902
She's pregnant.

1:15:27.902 --> 1:15:29.863
Oh!

1:15:29.863 --> 1:15:31.823
Oh...

1:15:31.823 --> 1:15:33.575
Oh!

1:15:33.575 --> 1:15:34.826
Oh, I'm so happy.

1:15:36.119 --> 1:15:37.746
You know, I had a feeling.

1:15:40.331 --> 1:15:43.418
You have been a gift as a son,

1:15:43.418 --> 1:15:45.837
and you two are going to be
amazing parents.

1:15:45.837 --> 1:15:47.589
Thank you.

1:15:47.589 --> 1:15:48.798
We're so excited.

1:15:48.798 --> 1:15:49.924
I know!

1:15:51.426 --> 1:15:52.802
Clark!

1:15:54.012 --> 1:15:55.764
Hi...

1:15:55.764 --> 1:15:57.182
It's a wonderful exhibit, Avery.

1:15:57.182 --> 1:15:58.266
Thank you for having me.

1:15:58.266 --> 1:15:59.559
Oh, I'm thrilled you're here.

1:15:59.559 --> 1:16:01.102
Both of you.

1:16:02.437 --> 1:16:05.273
I wasn't sure
if I should come or not...

1:16:07.359 --> 1:16:09.277
Um...

1:16:10.987 --> 1:16:13.281
Clark, I feel like
I owe you an apology.

1:16:16.409 --> 1:16:17.285
I'd settle for your friendship.

1:16:19.954 --> 1:16:21.373
Well, let me earn it, first.

1:16:24.417 --> 1:16:26.127
Missing my father doesn't mean
that I can't like you.

1:16:28.713 --> 1:16:30.048
I like that my mother

1:16:30.048 --> 1:16:33.510
lights up every time
you're around her,

1:16:33.510 --> 1:16:35.595
and I like the fact
that my wife likes you,

1:16:35.595 --> 1:16:37.597
because she's always been
such a...

1:16:37.597 --> 1:16:39.599
such a great judge of character.

1:16:39.599 --> 1:16:41.309
And I like
that you're a pediatrician,

1:16:41.309 --> 1:16:42.102
because we're gonna need one.

1:16:42.102 --> 1:16:43.436
Oh...

1:16:43.436 --> 1:16:44.854
And I like
having you by my side.

1:16:47.732 --> 1:16:49.150
And so do I.

1:17:04.666 --> 1:17:06.751
My sister
never comes to these things

1:17:06.751 --> 1:17:07.877
and she's here!

1:17:07.877 --> 1:17:08.837
She brought her boyfriend...

1:17:08.837 --> 1:17:10.714
They're standing
next to the veil.

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:13.216
Well, Stanbridge
has never had a bigger turnout,

1:17:13.216 --> 1:17:14.509
or a more enthusiastic one.

1:17:14.509 --> 1:17:16.720
Yeah, the headcount
is off the charts.

1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:18.805
I still don't know

1:17:18.805 --> 1:17:21.474
what to make
of you or your methods...

1:17:21.474 --> 1:17:22.809
but it is working.

1:17:24.060 --> 1:17:25.270
I'd like to think

1:17:25.270 --> 1:17:27.022
that I'm honest enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

1:17:27.022 --> 1:17:28.732
Does this mean
the Amici can stay?

1:17:30.525 --> 1:17:33.028
Yes, as part of
the permanent collection.

1:17:34.529 --> 1:17:35.780
I'm so happy.

1:17:35.780 --> 1:17:37.824
I am so happy,
I could just hug you,

1:17:37.824 --> 1:17:39.492
but I--
I'll quit while I'm ahead.

1:17:39.492 --> 1:17:40.952
That's probably best.

1:17:42.078 --> 1:17:43.079
I also understand

1:17:43.079 --> 1:17:44.164
that congratulations
are in order?

1:17:45.832 --> 1:17:47.584
You're a lucky man.

1:17:47.584 --> 1:17:48.918
Thanks.

1:17:51.046 --> 1:17:52.339
I'm hormonal.
Indulge me.

1:17:52.339 --> 1:17:53.340
Okay...

1:17:57.344 --> 1:17:58.219
Well done.

1:17:59.262 --> 1:18:00.221
Thank you.

1:18:01.639 --> 1:18:02.640
To the Amici...

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:03.975
To the Amici.

1:18:13.193 --> 1:18:14.110
What are you doing?

1:18:15.904 --> 1:18:16.821
I just want to show you

1:18:16.821 --> 1:18:18.114
that I'll always be the one

1:18:18.114 --> 1:18:21.034
that wakes you up in the morning
with roses.

1:18:21.034 --> 1:18:21.993
Thank you.

1:18:24.204 --> 1:18:25.330
I can't believe

1:18:25.330 --> 1:18:27.499
we're standing here
in our family room.

1:18:27.499 --> 1:18:28.333
Soon to be a family.

1:18:28.333 --> 1:18:30.085
Yeah.

1:18:31.544 --> 1:18:33.254
- You know what I've realized?
- What?

1:18:33.254 --> 1:18:35.131
It's not about curtains
and sofas, it's...

1:18:35.131 --> 1:18:36.925
It's about us.

1:18:38.468 --> 1:18:39.386
This room
will never be finished,

1:18:39.386 --> 1:18:41.721
because there'll be more kids,

1:18:41.721 --> 1:18:42.806
more decisions to make...

1:18:44.599 --> 1:18:46.685
You know,
and with all those kids,

1:18:46.685 --> 1:18:48.603
we're gonna have to get a dog,

1:18:48.603 --> 1:18:50.313
and the dog
is gonna ruin the sofas.

1:18:50.313 --> 1:18:52.315
No, don't say that.

1:18:52.315 --> 1:18:53.483
I love those sofas.

1:18:53.483 --> 1:18:54.484
We'll just get them reupholstered.

1:18:54.484 --> 1:18:55.735
Yeah.

1:18:55.735 --> 1:18:58.905
Yeah, as we go along,
we'll just--

1:18:58.905 --> 1:18:59.989
we'll keep what works,

1:18:59.989 --> 1:19:01.449
and we'll redo the rest.

1:19:02.909 --> 1:19:04.160
I can imagine

1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:05.245
all the memories
we're going to make in here.

1:19:07.872 --> 1:19:09.290
How about we make
one of those memories right now?

1:19:39.404 --> 1:19:40.572
Well, welcome to the family.

1:19:40.572 --> 1:19:42.449
Thank you, Peter.

1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:54.919
Here we are...

1:19:54.919 --> 1:19:57.422
Yes, here we are.

1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:15.065
It was so nice of Grace
to invite us to her wedding.

1:20:15.065 --> 1:20:16.816
I know. I gave her the veil
and told her the legend,

1:20:16.816 --> 1:20:18.860
and she insisted

1:20:18.860 --> 1:20:20.904
that she share her day
with the three of us.

1:20:20.904 --> 1:20:22.655
As far as mother-in-laws go,
you picked a good one.

1:20:22.655 --> 1:20:24.282
She's the best.

1:20:24.282 --> 1:20:27.327
Do you know that Clark proposed
to her underneath the Amici?

1:20:27.327 --> 1:20:29.287
It's become the place
for couples to get engaged.

1:20:29.287 --> 1:20:31.081
And it all started
with you and Peter.

1:20:32.207 --> 1:20:34.292
Speaking of the perfect family,

1:20:34.292 --> 1:20:36.586
can we sneak another peek
at our Godson?

1:20:36.586 --> 1:20:37.671
That is a great idea.

1:20:37.671 --> 1:20:38.838
He's not sleeping, is he?
Please?

1:20:38.838 --> 1:20:40.173
No, he should be awake by now.

1:20:40.173 --> 1:20:41.508
Come on.

1:20:45.053 --> 1:20:47.263
Hi.

1:20:47.263 --> 1:20:48.306
Hello.

1:20:48.306 --> 1:20:49.557
Hi!

1:20:49.557 --> 1:20:50.558
Look who's here to see you.

1:20:51.768 --> 1:20:54.145
Yeah.

1:20:54.145 --> 1:20:55.605
- Hi, Daniel.
- Hello.

1:20:55.605 --> 1:20:56.940
Look who came
to see you, Daniel.

1:20:58.483 --> 1:21:02.153
He is just officially
the cutest baby on the planet.

1:21:03.738 --> 1:21:05.115
Well, you could have one, too?

1:21:05.115 --> 1:21:06.574
Maybe you should just have two.

1:21:08.827 --> 1:21:11.037
Then we get to be Godmothers
all over again.

1:21:12.205 --> 1:21:14.124
Honestly, how could you ever
even top him?

1:21:14.124 --> 1:21:15.375
I know.

1:21:15.375 --> 1:21:16.501
- He's the best.
- Isn't he the most precious?

1:21:16.501 --> 1:21:18.003
Yeah.

1:21:18.003 --> 1:21:18.920
Oh, I wanted to give you
the Christening gown back.

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:20.130
Yeah, oh, thank you.

1:21:22.298 --> 1:21:25.427
Hello, Mr. Man.

1:21:25.427 --> 1:21:27.053
It's okay.

1:21:27.053 --> 1:21:28.263
Did Paulo's grandmother
put you up to this?

1:21:30.015 --> 1:21:30.890
What do you think, Daniel?

1:21:30.890 --> 1:21:32.225
Are you hungry?

1:21:32.225 --> 1:21:34.060
Oh, you want to eat my arms?
Are you hungry?

1:21:39.315 --> 1:21:41.443
Every time I see you guys,
someone's getting married.

1:21:41.443 --> 1:21:43.028
What is this,
our fourth wedding together?

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:46.031
Well, there's more to come
now that Carly is engaged.

1:21:46.031 --> 1:21:49.659
Gia was hoping to give the veil
to Nick's sister, Monica.

1:21:49.659 --> 1:21:50.785
Oh, I love that.

1:21:50.785 --> 1:21:51.745
- Yeah?
- That's a great idea.

1:21:51.745 --> 1:21:53.121
Oh, that's great. Yay.

1:21:53.121 --> 1:21:55.123
Oh, I'm being summoned
by the bride and groom.

1:21:55.123 --> 1:21:56.207
Okay.

1:21:58.543 --> 1:21:59.753
You know, we have to decide
where we're going

1:21:59.753 --> 1:22:00.920
for our next reunion weekend.

1:22:00.920 --> 1:22:03.465
I liked your idea
of New Orleans.

1:22:03.465 --> 1:22:05.300
Oh, but then we'll have
to make it a long weekend,

1:22:05.300 --> 1:22:07.093
because there's
so much good antiquing.

1:22:07.093 --> 1:22:09.054
And good food and good music...

1:22:09.054 --> 1:22:10.889
...and great company.

1:22:10.889 --> 1:22:12.098
Excuse me.
Would you mind?

1:22:13.808 --> 1:22:15.143
Thank you.

1:22:15.143 --> 1:22:16.019
We have to have
our traditional toast, right?

1:22:16.019 --> 1:22:17.645
- Just a little.
- Yes.

1:22:17.645 --> 1:22:20.398
To true love...

1:22:20.398 --> 1:22:21.608
...and friendship...

1:22:21.608 --> 1:22:23.777
...and to the veil,

1:22:23.777 --> 1:22:26.321
for the happiness
it continues to bring.

1:22:26.321 --> 1:22:28.323
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:22:28.323 --> 1:22:29.449
Cheers.

1:22:29.449 --> 1:22:30.992
Sweetie.

1:22:30.992 --> 1:22:32.535
Oh, I think
they're doing the cake.

1:22:32.535 --> 1:22:33.912
Oh! I love cake.

1:22:33.912 --> 1:22:35.497
We're going to cut the cake!

1:22:37.957 --> 1:22:42.003
♪ Can I stay forever? ♪

1:22:45.006 --> 1:22:46.675
♪ Can I stay forever? ♪

1:22:52.722 --> 1:22:54.724
♪ Forever ♪

1:22:59.312 --> 1:23:01.398
So, how did you two meet?

1:23:01.398 --> 1:23:03.650
Um, well...

1:23:03.650 --> 1:23:04.901
Well...

1:23:04.901 --> 1:23:06.319
She stole a cab from me,
I think.

1:23:06.319 --> 1:23:07.821
No, you stole my cab.
He stole my cab.

1:23:07.821 --> 1:23:09.948
No. I remember I actually had
my hand on the cab,

1:23:09.948 --> 1:23:11.324
and then you wanted it,
and I gave it to you.

1:23:11.324 --> 1:23:12.617
It was my cab,
but he gave it to me,

1:23:12.617 --> 1:23:13.618
and I called him gallant.

1:23:13.618 --> 1:23:15.203
Yeah.

1:23:15.203 --> 1:23:17.831
But you saw me with the veil
and thought I was engaged.

1:23:17.831 --> 1:23:21.793
Well, anybody carrying a veil
usually is getting married.

1:23:21.793 --> 1:23:23.169
But did you never stop to think

1:23:23.169 --> 1:23:25.171
I didn't have a ring
on my finger?

1:23:25.171 --> 1:23:28.008
What did you first notice
about Peter?

1:23:28.008 --> 1:23:29.300
His accent.
