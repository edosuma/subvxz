Raven: Raven's Home

00:04.004 --> 00:06.131
Can you guys believe
these are the last eggs

00:06.131 --> 00:07.799
I'll ever eat
as an eighth‐grader?

00:07.799 --> 00:10.010
Yeah, the next time
I eat strawberries,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.428
it will be
as valedictorian.

00:11.428 --> 00:15.098
The next time I drink juice,
it could be as Ramon's
girlfriend.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.809
And the next time
I eat Hula‐Loops, I'll...

00:19.186 --> 00:21.396
Oh wait,
nothing will be different.

00:23.190 --> 00:27.027
‐Oh!
‐Please, please,
no autographs, please!

00:27.027 --> 00:29.863
Yes. We put our pants on
one leg at a time

00:29.863 --> 00:31.782
just like
everyone else.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.992
Well, not me.
I need help.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.120
You look amazing, Mom.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.997
You and Auntie Rae
are going to crush it

00:38.997 --> 00:40.040
on <i>Spring‐Lake Spotlight.</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.708
Oh, I hope so, Levi.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.585
Chris Spring‐Lake's stamp
of approval could really put

00:43.585 --> 00:45.128
Your Best‐Dressed Life
on the map.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.296
What?

00:46.296 --> 00:48.340
Well, how will Chris
and his crew find our office

00:48.340 --> 00:50.175
if we're not even
on the map?

00:51.969 --> 00:54.721
You know what?
You have other gifts.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.976
You know what, family?
We are on fire!

00:58.976 --> 01:00.769
We've all got something

(laughing)

02:17.137 --> 02:19.890
I told you, Booker.
No peeking.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.975
You know I'm putting
the finishing touches

02:21.975 --> 02:23.894
on the Carver Quest
Treasure Hunt.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.687
Yeah, I know,
that's why I'm peeking.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.732
It's the biggest eighth‐grade
event of the year.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.150
And I want
my team to win!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.860
Well, you're not going
to win by cheating.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.529
What? It's not cheating
if you just help me.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.200
Look, I want to finish
eighth grade out on top

02:38.200 --> 02:40.202
and hit the
high school grounds running.

02:41.787 --> 02:43.163
What you up to,
shrimp toast?

02:44.164 --> 02:46.333
Top secret
Carver Quest business.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.417
I'm going to my room.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.127
Don't follow me!

02:51.505 --> 02:53.131
Can you believe it, Tess?

02:53.131 --> 02:55.550
We are going out as legends
at Carver Middle.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.135
I mean, me as valedictorian,

02:57.135 --> 02:59.346
and you as captain of the
championship basketball team.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.639
I know, right?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.974
I mean, I always knew
I'd be labeled a legend,

03:02.974 --> 03:04.393
just not this early
in life.

03:04.393 --> 03:07.145
(gasps) Should I start
my autobiography now?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.898
Um, legend?

03:09.898 --> 03:13.443
No, no, no. See, LeBron James
is a basketball legend, right?

03:13.443 --> 03:15.904
Mae Jemison,
astronaut legend.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.240
You two are just full
of yourselves.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.993
You just learned about
Mae Jemison last week.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.829
I‐‐ I knew
who Mae Jemison was.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.666
Okay, maybe I didn't.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.711
But the point is,
she's a legend and you're not.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.131
Booker, our names
will always be mentioned

03:34.131 --> 03:35.715
amongst the greats
that walked the halls

03:35.715 --> 03:37.008
of Carver Middle School.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.218
How are you
gonna be remembered?

03:42.931 --> 03:45.892
You deserve to be the legend
I always knew you were.

03:49.604 --> 03:52.482
Hello? Booker, how are you
gonna be remembered?

03:52.482 --> 03:54.568
‐Booker Baxter‐Carter...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.111
...snack legend. Mmm!

04:00.282 --> 04:02.284

04:04.202 --> 04:07.414
I have to say, Levi,
you're so well adjusted.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.249
If my siblings
were graduating

04:09.249 --> 04:11.251
and leaving me all alone
in middle school,

04:11.251 --> 04:13.879
I'd like to think I'd handle it
as well as you are.

04:14.463 --> 04:17.132
What? Booker and Nia
aren't leaving me all alone.

04:17.132 --> 04:19.468
They're just, you know,
going to high school.

04:19.468 --> 04:22.179
Exactly.
They're moving on.

04:22.179 --> 04:24.139
You won't see them
in the halls

04:24.139 --> 04:25.307
or have lunch with them.

04:25.307 --> 04:28.101
Not to mention all the
new friends they'll be making.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.104
Wow.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.606
I guess I never thought
about all that.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.192
(school bell rings)

04:35.192 --> 04:37.152
The treasure hunt starts
in five minutes.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.237
Levi, why don't you
go hide this last chest

04:39.237 --> 04:41.198
while I go handle
the masses in the gym?

04:48.163 --> 04:51.082
Okay, Chris Spring‐Lake
and his crew will be here
any minute!

04:51.082 --> 04:52.876
I know. I know.
Which means,

04:52.876 --> 04:56.630
I need to choose
my on‐screen persona
like yesterday.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.758
‐Your on‐what?
‐Ooh!

04:59.758 --> 05:04.095
Ooh, maybe I'll be
Ms. Divine Atwater.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.556
Mysterious,
silent, you know.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.183
What does she know?

05:08.183 --> 05:10.101
What is she hiding?

05:10.977 --> 05:12.604
Why is she even here?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.732
Ooh! Ooh, I know!
I'm gonna be...

05:15.732 --> 05:17.651

Tammy June Butterfield,

05:17.651 --> 05:19.361
who talks so much
no one else can get a word in.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.072
You know?
She just keeps talking.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.657
There's a Tammy on every one
of these shows.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.575
‐Chels. Chels.
‐She just keeps jaw‐jacking.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.369
‐(rambling indistinctly)
‐Tammy! Tammy!

05:29.412 --> 05:31.540
Can you bring Chels back?
She's more than enough.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.874
‐Yeah.
‐Okay, thanks.

‐They're here.
They're here. They're here.

You two look triple C.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.181
Hmm?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.182
Cha‐cha‐ching.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.017
‐Oh!
‐Oh yes. Yes.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.812
A little Spring‐Lake lexicon.
The focus groups love it.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.857
Now, are you ready
to film a TV show?

05:56.857 --> 06:00.193
(drawling):
Well, if you're asking
Ms. Tammy June Butterfield,

06:00.193 --> 06:02.070
you're rootin'‐tootin' right
we are!

06:03.154 --> 06:05.657
Nobody's asking, Tammy.
All right?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.451
What do you think
of our place?

06:08.451 --> 06:11.246
We designed it
so it had that friendly
television environment.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.456
‐Yeah.
‐I think this space
is amazing.

06:13.456 --> 06:15.542
‐(both squeal)
‐It looks perfect.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.711
‐I wouldn't change a thing.
‐Well, there it is!

06:18.753 --> 06:20.130
Okay, people.
We're changing everything!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.798
You know the drill.
Let's move!

06:21.798 --> 06:24.009
Wait, but hold up.
Wait a second.
You just said...

06:25.552 --> 06:27.888
Alexandra:
All right, eighth‐graders,

06:27.888 --> 06:31.224
who's excited for
this year's Carver Quest?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.101
(all cheering)

06:33.101 --> 06:35.270
I can't hear you!

06:35.270 --> 06:38.231
(cheering louder)

06:38.231 --> 06:39.900
I said I‐‐

06:40.400 --> 06:42.444
Oh, sorry, I still had
my earbuds in.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.114
As you know,
you'll break off into teams

06:46.114 --> 06:48.158
and will be given
an envelope with a clue

06:48.158 --> 06:50.452
that will lead you
to your first treasure chest.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.996
Each team will have
their own set of clues.

06:52.996 --> 06:55.165
But you're all competing
for the grand prize,

06:55.165 --> 06:56.499
to have your names engraved

06:56.499 --> 06:59.044
on The Wall
of Peanut Legends.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.007
I can see it now.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.175
The wall?

07:06.134 --> 07:09.012
No, my name...
on the wall.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.347
And I just sent out

07:10.347 --> 07:12.182
your team assignments

‐Me too.

bring to the table,

07:39.084 --> 07:40.669
we're going
to be legends!

07:40.669 --> 07:43.254
Look, Book, I'm not pressed
to win anything today.

07:43.254 --> 07:45.799
I've worked my tail off,

07:50.220 --> 07:51.930
Yes, Book,

07:56.101 --> 07:58.436
Nia, this is my chance
to leave my mark.

07:58.436 --> 08:00.563
I need my name
on that wall.

08:00.563 --> 08:01.940
It's not fair.

Over you, Tess?
Never.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.786
But, hey, if I were you,
I wouldn't trust Danisha.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.830
You know she stole
student council election
right from under me.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.405
I was stealing
the spotlight

19:16.405 --> 19:17.990
instead of shining it
on you two.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.159
No!

19:20.159 --> 19:21.577
Well...

19:21.577 --> 19:23.162
thanks, ladies,

19:23.162 --> 19:25.623
for putting a mirror up
and helping me see the real me.

19:25.623 --> 19:26.999
Aw, you're welcome,
Chris.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.168
Yeah. Because
with a face like mine,

19:29.168 --> 19:30.961
you can't help
but love a mirror!

19:32.296 --> 19:34.048
That five seconds
of humility

19:34.048 --> 19:35.591
‐was worth everything, Chelsea.
‐Yeah.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.259
Your name's Chelsea?

19:40.304 --> 19:42.181
Yo, guys,
I have the final clue!

19:42.181 --> 19:44.016
‐Let's hear it, Captain.
‐All right, all right.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.686
"Ice cream in summer,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.229
"safety in snow.

19:48.229 --> 19:50.022
"Around me, use caution.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.732
The third in the row."

19:53.275 --> 19:54.276
Cones.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.404
Traffic cones.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.823
Third one,
there it is!

20:02.743 --> 20:04.161
What?
We did it!

20:04.161 --> 20:05.621
Guys,
I'm so proud of you.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.956
We're proud
of you, Book.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.624
You led us
to victory.

20:08.624 --> 20:09.625
Booker!

20:09.625 --> 20:11.544
All: Booker! Booker!

20:11.544 --> 20:13.671
Guys, guys, guys,
please, now.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.005
You can do a little bit
better than that.

20:15.005 --> 20:16.424
Just a little louder,
come on.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.426
Booker! Booker!

20:18.426 --> 20:22.179
And the winner
of the Carver Quest,

20:22.179 --> 20:25.099
forever a Carver legend, is...

20:25.099 --> 20:26.392
the Blue Team!

20:26.392 --> 20:29.145
(cheering)

20:29.145 --> 20:33.149
Led by Captain
Booker Baxter‐Carter.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.359
(cheering)

20:38.654 --> 20:41.282
Sorry, Danisha,
you're too late.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.075
But, um, I hear
you're funny.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.994
Do you mind if I run
some jokes by you?

20:44.994 --> 20:47.204
I've got some great
legume material.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.498
Yes, Tess, finally!

20:49.498 --> 20:51.041
Um, I've wanted
to talk to you.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.626
Let me guess...

20:52.626 --> 20:54.044
‐Can we make us official?
‐...you're moving on
with Danisha.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.171
Both: Wait, what?

20:56.005 --> 20:57.840
I, I don't even
know Danisha.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.383
She rolls her eyes
more than she talks.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.178
You, you want me
to be your girlfriend?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.139
I mean, yeah.
Unless you don't want to be.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.766
You know, it's totally cool,
I'm, I'm cool‐‐

21:06.766 --> 21:08.392
Ramon.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.728
I totally want to be
your girlfriend.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.313
Cool.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.773
Hey, bestie!

21:14.273 --> 21:15.775
My boyfriend.
