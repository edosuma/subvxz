00:15.111 --> 00:16.838
Is that all you got?

00:19.088 --> 00:22.395
I was hoping to trade these
for some coffee beans.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.355
You hungry?

00:25.465 --> 00:26.723
Yeah.

00:27.259 --> 00:28.738
Get some water.

00:28.824 --> 00:30.391
I'll make lunch.

00:49.473 --> 00:51.059
You know what to do, son.

00:51.188 --> 00:52.512
Yes, sir.

00:52.598 --> 00:54.191
Remember...

00:54.735 --> 00:56.215
this is our land.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.245
It's kill or be killed.

01:07.779 --> 01:09.543
<i>Mr. Schwieger. State Police.</i>

01:09.667 --> 01:11.082
<i>I need you to step outside.</i>

01:11.168 --> 01:12.309
Now.

01:18.981 --> 01:20.891
Kill or be killed.

01:22.821 --> 01:23.857
So where are we going?

01:23.942 --> 01:25.293
What are we doing?

01:25.378 --> 01:27.656
And who is this wonder of
wonders I just have to meet?

01:27.742 --> 01:29.833
What did you call him?
A walking anachronism?

01:29.962 --> 01:32.320
Lucas Schwieger, 16.

01:32.406 --> 01:33.961
He never attended school.

01:34.141 --> 01:36.450
He lives a completely
sheltered existence

01:36.535 --> 01:39.102
in a cabin with no
electricity or running water

01:39.211 --> 01:41.274
in the woods above
Sullivan County.

01:41.414 --> 01:43.022
His father, whom
he lived with,

01:43.107 --> 01:45.625
described himself as
a radical survivalist.

01:45.766 --> 01:48.375
He was, as far as I can tell,
the only person

01:48.460 --> 01:50.377
that Lucas had any
sustained contact with

01:50.462 --> 01:52.446
during his 16
years of life.

01:52.635 --> 01:53.726
Wow.

01:53.820 --> 01:55.868
A caseworker with
Child Protective Services

01:56.066 --> 01:59.539
heard about him, grew concerned,
came to pay him a visit...

01:59.775 --> 02:02.399
escorted by
the New York State Police.

02:02.720 --> 02:05.348
"Father and son opened fire,
killing the caseworker

02:05.433 --> 02:07.698
"and wounding
the State Police officer,

02:07.783 --> 02:10.720
who fired back,
killing the father."

02:11.165 --> 02:14.053
Ballistics indicate that while
Lucas shot the police officer,

02:14.138 --> 02:17.118
wounding him in the leg,
he didn't actually kill anyone.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.024
It was the father's gun
that did that.

02:19.148 --> 02:21.680
Nonetheless, he's being charged
as an adult for murder

02:21.766 --> 02:23.337
as part of a joint venture.

02:23.517 --> 02:26.579
Does he even understand
what's going on? The charges?

02:26.715 --> 02:29.068
That they want him
to stand trial?

02:29.153 --> 02:30.977
They want to punish him
for what happened?

02:31.063 --> 02:33.201
He didn't even understand
what an attorney was

02:33.287 --> 02:34.938
until I explained it to him.

02:35.055 --> 02:36.970
You know, it's not like
he's mentally impaired.

02:37.056 --> 02:38.947
In fact, in the little time
I've spent with him,

02:39.033 --> 02:40.558
he seems innately intelligent.

02:40.644 --> 02:42.213
But his only understanding
of the world

02:42.299 --> 02:44.141
is what's been taught
to him by his father.

02:44.227 --> 02:46.085
Well, obviously,
some doctor, somewhere,

02:46.170 --> 02:47.626
deemed him fit
to stand trial.

02:47.720 --> 02:49.970
You should also know
that Lucas did speak

02:50.056 --> 02:51.930
to the police
on the record.

02:52.176 --> 02:54.180
He already admitted
he shot the officer.

02:54.265 --> 02:55.766
Expressed clear intent.

02:55.852 --> 02:58.332
Insisted he would
do it again.

03:18.885 --> 03:20.452
He's a friend.

03:24.596 --> 03:26.299
My name's Dr. Jason Bull.

03:26.384 --> 03:27.996
Dr. Statton wanted me
to meet you.

03:28.081 --> 03:29.401
See if I could help you.

03:29.869 --> 03:31.330
Doctor, huh?

03:31.973 --> 03:33.213
I'm not sick.

03:33.330 --> 03:35.854
No. I'm not the doctor
that helps sick people.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.073
I'm the doctor that helps people
when they get into trouble,

03:39.463 --> 03:41.190
when they have to go to court.

03:42.095 --> 03:43.307
Do you know what court is?

03:43.393 --> 03:46.135
Did Dr. Statton explain
about court to you?

03:50.321 --> 03:51.893
Let me start over.

03:53.367 --> 03:57.371
First of all,
I'm sorry about your father.

03:58.720 --> 04:00.505
They had better guns.

04:03.549 --> 04:05.885
How about your mom?

04:06.807 --> 04:08.330
Do you ever see her?

04:08.509 --> 04:09.949
Is there any way
I could talk to her?

04:10.034 --> 04:11.244
No.

04:11.528 --> 04:13.053
She hung herself.

04:13.474 --> 04:15.041
It was when I was a little kid.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.538
I'm sorry.

04:24.982 --> 04:26.332
Lucas...

04:27.314 --> 04:29.318
do you understand
you could spend

04:29.403 --> 04:31.463
the rest of your life
in here, in jail?

04:31.986 --> 04:34.002
And I'm guessing you don't
want that. Am I right?

04:34.088 --> 04:35.151
I just want to go home.

04:35.237 --> 04:38.346
And that's what we want to try
and make happen.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.198
You all right
with that?

04:45.271 --> 04:46.604
I guess so.

04:47.510 --> 04:48.760
All right.

04:49.123 --> 04:52.389
Let me get back to my office,
get this started.

04:52.638 --> 04:54.893
I'm sure I'm gonna want
to talk to you some more.

04:54.979 --> 04:57.393
In the meantime, is there
anything I can bring you?

04:57.512 --> 05:00.733
Anything you miss?
Maybe some books?

05:06.355 --> 05:09.471
Well, if you think
of anything.

05:17.668 --> 05:19.831
<font color=#FF00FF>*BULL (2016)*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03  Episode17</font>

05:20.064 --> 05:22.667
<font color=#FF00FF>*BULL (2016)*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Parental Guidance"</font>

05:24.908 --> 05:27.391
This is Lucas Schwieger.
16 years old.

05:27.476 --> 05:28.827
Charged with murder in the death

05:28.912 --> 05:31.213
of a New York State
Children's Services caseworker.

05:31.299 --> 05:33.806
Yeah. We all got Bull's e-mail
about this kid.

05:33.892 --> 05:35.650
He can't read. Barely speaks.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.095
Lived with his dad off the grid

05:37.181 --> 05:39.658
his whole life.
Oh, and let's not forget

05:39.744 --> 05:41.056
he confessed to the crime.

05:41.142 --> 05:42.322
So I'll just say it.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.056
Can we even help this boy?

05:44.142 --> 05:46.939
We've got the surviving
police officer's testimony.

05:47.025 --> 05:48.549
Plus the confession.

05:48.635 --> 05:50.104
And this client
doesn't seem like he's

05:50.189 --> 05:51.846
in a position to really help
his own defense.

05:51.931 --> 05:53.033
And what kind of narrative?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.518
What kind of story
can you tell a jury

05:54.603 --> 05:57.127
that makes it okay to ambush
a caseworker and a trooper?

05:57.213 --> 05:58.259
Bull wants to mount

05:58.345 --> 06:00.767
a defense based on
persuasive coercion.

06:00.853 --> 06:03.845
Our position will be that,
because of Lucas's sheltered

06:03.931 --> 06:06.533
and isolated upbringing, he
didn't know what he was doing,

06:06.658 --> 06:08.541
other than following
the instructions of,

06:08.627 --> 06:13.158
quite literally, the only person
in his life: his father.

06:13.799 --> 06:16.439
Norman Schwieger was delusional

06:16.525 --> 06:18.549
and paranoid and controlling.

06:18.705 --> 06:21.213
He was convinced
that humankind was on the verge

06:21.299 --> 06:23.611
of a cataclysmic end and thought
the only way to survive

06:23.697 --> 06:25.978
was to live a completely
self-sustaining life

06:26.080 --> 06:28.666
away from the scrutiny
of other human beings.

06:28.838 --> 06:31.806
And he forced his son
to live the same way...

06:32.025 --> 06:33.861
cloistered on their
small plot of land,

06:33.947 --> 06:35.955
which they didn't even
really own,

06:36.041 --> 06:38.127
which Norman rigged
with trip-wired alarms

06:38.213 --> 06:40.017
to warn them of any trespassers.

06:40.322 --> 06:41.299
Okay. I'll ask.

06:41.385 --> 06:42.978
What is persuasive coercion?

06:43.064 --> 06:45.931
Basically, Bull wants to argue
for all intents and purposes

06:46.026 --> 06:49.771
that Lucas's father exercised
a kind of mind control over him.

06:49.856 --> 06:51.512
Denied the boy a voice

06:51.597 --> 06:53.728
in any decision-making
of any kind.

06:53.814 --> 06:57.017
His job was simply to do
what he was told.

06:57.121 --> 06:59.606
And as a result,
he had no experience choosing

06:59.692 --> 07:02.088
between right and wrong,
no experience choosing anything.

07:02.283 --> 07:04.752
The problem is,
it's an affirmative defense.

07:04.861 --> 07:07.064
Hi. Zero years
of law school here.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.478
Though I did watch a lot
of Ally McBealback in the '90s.

07:09.564 --> 07:11.720
So what does that mean?
"Affirmative defense"?

07:11.806 --> 07:13.245
That means that
going in, we admit

07:13.331 --> 07:15.056
to what the prosecution
claims he did.

07:15.142 --> 07:17.666
And now it puts the burden on us
to present evidence

07:17.752 --> 07:19.496
that will negate
his having done it.

07:19.642 --> 07:22.107
Basically, yes, he shot
at those people, but no,

07:22.192 --> 07:24.338
given the circumstances,
it wasn't his fault.

07:24.431 --> 07:26.267
And how do we make
that argument?

07:26.454 --> 07:28.414
Is there anyone left to testify?

07:28.711 --> 07:32.029
With Lucas's father dead,
it leaves us without one witness

07:32.115 --> 07:34.822
who can tell the jury about the
crazy way that Lucas grew up.

07:34.908 --> 07:36.572
And based on Bull's e-mails,

07:36.658 --> 07:38.830
it's highly unlikely
that we'll be able

07:38.916 --> 07:40.698
to put Lucas himself
on the stand.

07:40.784 --> 07:42.791
Wait a second.
Someone saw something,

07:42.877 --> 07:44.315
because Child
Protective Services

07:44.401 --> 07:45.926
were sent to this house.

07:46.138 --> 07:47.541
I know those calls
are confidential,

07:47.627 --> 07:50.109
but I'll start digging and see
if I can find out who did it.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.041
You know what the
trick is gonna be?

07:52.251 --> 07:54.846
Trying to get a jury
to connect with this kid

07:54.940 --> 07:57.249
despite everything
about his life

07:57.335 --> 07:59.611
being vastly different
from their own.

08:00.319 --> 08:02.979
I can't wait to hear
what the big guy has to say.

08:04.854 --> 08:06.705
You ever seen
one of these before?

08:06.791 --> 08:08.587
It's called a tie.

08:08.961 --> 08:11.883
It's what men wear when they
want to be taken seriously.

08:12.655 --> 08:15.196
It hurts.
Hurts my neck.

08:16.648 --> 08:18.657
Well, every man who's ever
put one of these on

08:18.743 --> 08:21.751
has thought that,
but still...

08:22.236 --> 08:25.399
people have been wearing them
for hundreds of years.

08:27.860 --> 08:29.618
Went to church once.

08:29.802 --> 08:31.423
Saw some there.

08:34.169 --> 08:37.653
So, today... today is all
about picking jurors,

08:37.738 --> 08:39.844
the people who decide whether
to punish you or not.

08:40.063 --> 08:42.328
Mr. Colón is gonna be
asking people questions.

08:42.414 --> 08:43.876
You don't have to do
anything; just sit there.

08:43.962 --> 08:45.357
Try not to react.

08:45.443 --> 08:47.774
And don't say a word
unless I tell you to.

08:47.882 --> 08:50.800
Remember, people are gonna
be looking at you. Okay?

08:50.939 --> 08:52.769
Trying to figure
out who you are.

08:52.870 --> 08:54.930
They might make funny faces.
Don't make any back.

08:55.016 --> 08:56.324
You just sit there,
try to smile.

08:56.410 --> 08:57.978
It's probably gonna
take the whole day.

08:58.064 --> 08:59.633
Mr. Colón and I
will do our best

08:59.719 --> 09:01.798
to get you out of there
as quickly as possible.

09:28.279 --> 09:29.686
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:29.811 --> 09:31.381
Let me ask you all a question.

09:31.467 --> 09:34.639
How many of you, especially
when you were teenagers,

09:34.725 --> 09:37.772
had a less than terrific
relationship with your parents?

09:38.516 --> 09:39.717
You, sir.

09:39.866 --> 09:42.175
You were at war with
your folks a lot?

09:42.446 --> 09:44.709
Well, my old man
was a taskmaster.

09:45.116 --> 09:46.177
Very old-school.

09:46.262 --> 09:48.658
And I was the kind of kid
who didn't really like rules.

09:48.743 --> 09:49.964
Got it.

09:50.049 --> 09:52.183
And all of you pretty much feel
the same way?

09:52.444 --> 09:55.436
That your parents didn't
necessarily know best?

09:59.232 --> 10:01.467
Your Honor, the defense
would like to thank

10:01.553 --> 10:04.170
and excuse jurors number three,

10:04.280 --> 10:06.483
eight, ten and 12.

10:07.889 --> 10:11.248
We need jurors who see
Lucas was a part of a cult of two.

10:11.334 --> 10:14.952
Brainwashed to hate like a sort
of Manchurian Candidate.

10:15.291 --> 10:16.944
And how do we do that?

10:17.857 --> 10:21.084
We look for people who can be
persuaded to follow a leader.

10:21.214 --> 10:23.514
They may not understand
the environment Lucas

10:23.600 --> 10:25.868
was raised in,
but they can relate

10:25.954 --> 10:27.514
to his need to do as he's told.

10:27.615 --> 10:29.897
People who are risk averse

10:29.983 --> 10:32.031
and make middle-of-the-road
decisions.

10:32.439 --> 10:33.569
So, tell me, sir,

10:33.655 --> 10:35.311
do you invest in
the stock market?

10:35.397 --> 10:36.498
I do.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.142
Do you buy tech stocks,
high-risk investments,

10:39.228 --> 10:41.428
or are you more of a S&P 500

10:41.514 --> 10:42.561
kind of investor?

10:42.662 --> 10:44.579
I actually like to go
with mutual funds.

10:44.821 --> 10:47.391
Let someone who knows what
they're doing decide for me.

10:47.585 --> 10:49.804
Play it safe.
Get a steady return.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.952
Your Honor, the defense finds
this juror acceptable.

10:55.139 --> 10:56.726
And we have our jury.

10:56.944 --> 10:59.772
The court is in recess
until tomorrow morning.

11:01.447 --> 11:02.537
Nice job.

11:02.623 --> 11:04.655
You did everything
we asked perfectly.

11:04.869 --> 11:06.381
We had a good day.

11:07.319 --> 11:09.092
Does that mean
I can go home now?

11:09.959 --> 11:12.220
No. No.

11:12.577 --> 11:14.022
I'm sorry, this is...

11:14.350 --> 11:15.647
gonna take many days.

11:15.733 --> 11:18.127
Today was a good day
but not the only day.

11:19.897 --> 11:21.532
Are you going home?

11:22.803 --> 11:24.273
Yes.

11:27.886 --> 11:29.788
Is he going home now?

11:30.217 --> 11:31.567
Yes.

11:35.717 --> 11:37.504
But not me?

11:38.871 --> 11:40.209
Not yet.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.631
What are we gonna do
about this confession?

12:00.717 --> 12:03.709
Talk about taking advantage
of someone's limited capacity.

12:03.802 --> 12:05.289
That's why I hung around...
I wanted to get it

12:05.374 --> 12:07.561
- in front of both of you.
- It's pretty damning.

12:07.813 --> 12:09.313
I get the feeling,
if they had asked him

12:09.398 --> 12:11.678
where Hoffa's body was buried,
he would have told them.

12:11.842 --> 12:13.108
How about I
file a motion

12:13.194 --> 12:15.600
to get the confession thrown out
first thing in the morning?

12:15.827 --> 12:18.286
That's how you get to be
Benjamin Colón.

12:18.545 --> 12:20.030
Does that mean we're
done for the day?

12:20.116 --> 12:21.873
I know I am.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.354
Are you happy?

12:29.753 --> 12:31.538
I'm sorry?

12:31.897 --> 12:33.467
Are you happy?

12:33.746 --> 12:37.514
I am lying here naked
next to my naked husband,

12:37.768 --> 12:42.061
watching do-it-yourself bathroom
projects at 8:30 at night.

12:42.255 --> 12:43.928
I'm euphoric.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.709
Why?

12:48.881 --> 12:50.452
I don't know, uh...

12:50.678 --> 12:53.319
the mail was piling up,
and I finally got around

12:53.405 --> 12:54.975
to going through it,

12:55.136 --> 12:58.342
and there was a thing
from a fertility clinic.

12:59.022 --> 13:00.483
A bill.

13:01.258 --> 13:04.905
They wanted to know if they
should keep your eggs frozen

13:04.991 --> 13:07.850
or just... throw 'em away.

13:12.464 --> 13:16.288
I didn't even know that
you had frozen some eggs.

13:17.056 --> 13:19.147
I didn't even
know that you...

13:19.513 --> 13:20.725
wanted kids.

13:20.811 --> 13:22.272
I mean...

13:23.478 --> 13:25.639
I seem to recall
when we first got married

13:25.725 --> 13:27.881
that we sort of
figured out that...

13:28.085 --> 13:30.916
we didn't... want them.

13:31.413 --> 13:32.741
God.

13:32.934 --> 13:36.014
I so didn't see
this conversation coming.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.827
I love what we have.

13:40.148 --> 13:42.702
I love our life
just the way it is.

13:43.347 --> 13:45.342
But we're paying
to keep your eggs

13:45.428 --> 13:47.889
in some stranger's Deepfreeze.

13:48.503 --> 13:50.366
I know.

13:50.664 --> 13:53.624
How can I explain this to you?

13:55.047 --> 13:57.398
After our divorce...

13:58.905 --> 14:00.430
friends with kids
kept telling me

14:00.516 --> 14:02.016
that something's
gonna happen,

14:02.271 --> 14:04.580
that I'd suddenly
want them, too.

14:04.937 --> 14:08.396
That some switch would flip
and it would be too late,

14:08.481 --> 14:10.625
and this was something
I needed to plan for.

14:10.913 --> 14:12.266
And you're right,

14:12.352 --> 14:15.078
I never had that thing,
that... kid thing,

14:15.164 --> 14:18.422
but I thought:
"Don't be stupid.

14:18.773 --> 14:21.523
You don't know how you're
gonna feel in five years."

14:22.140 --> 14:23.766
So I did it. I...

14:24.379 --> 14:26.883
just... did it.

14:27.667 --> 14:29.406
I guess...

14:30.566 --> 14:32.437
deep down...

14:32.939 --> 14:35.102
I wanted to have
the option.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.305
So did it happen?

14:39.594 --> 14:42.586
Did your... switch flip?

14:44.886 --> 14:46.703
I really don't know.

14:48.523 --> 14:50.102
How would you feel
if it did?

14:50.188 --> 14:52.364
I really don't know, either.

14:56.202 --> 14:57.641
I think...

14:57.862 --> 15:02.215
I need to give it some
thought before I answer.

15:03.243 --> 15:04.781
Okay.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.062
I think I do, too.

15:08.133 --> 15:09.602
Okay.

15:25.468 --> 15:28.844
So, this morning is just
gonna be about Mr. Colón

15:29.006 --> 15:31.234
trying to convince
the court to ignore

15:31.320 --> 15:32.993
what you told the police
when they arrested you.

15:33.078 --> 15:34.430
The jury's not even
gonna be there.

15:34.515 --> 15:36.213
Did I say something bad?

15:38.196 --> 15:42.094
Well, you said you did it,
and you said you'd do it again.

15:45.825 --> 15:48.088
Should I say
something different?

15:49.901 --> 15:51.644
No. Just...

15:51.767 --> 15:52.806
do what you did yesterday:

15:52.891 --> 15:55.109
Don't speak
unless Mr. Colón asks you to.

15:55.543 --> 15:57.062
Just sit.

15:57.198 --> 15:58.906
We'll do the rest.

16:00.985 --> 16:02.953
Your Honor, the
defense would like to file

16:03.039 --> 16:05.652
a motion to suppress
Lucas Schwieger's statements

16:05.738 --> 16:07.805
to the police
at the time of his arrest.

16:07.948 --> 16:09.039
It's gonna be fine.

16:09.125 --> 16:11.562
Your Honor, there are simply
no grounds for this.

16:11.648 --> 16:13.664
The defendant made
a knowing and voluntary

16:13.750 --> 16:14.945
and intelligent waiver.

16:15.031 --> 16:18.133
"A knowing and voluntary
and intelligent waiver."

16:18.219 --> 16:20.745
Your Honor, prior to
my client's arrest,

16:20.831 --> 16:22.852
he had never even
seen a state trooper

16:23.043 --> 16:25.526
or a courtroom or, for
that matter, an attorney.

16:25.667 --> 16:27.625
He didn't even know
what an attorney was,

16:27.711 --> 16:30.133
didn't know he had rights
under the law.

16:30.227 --> 16:31.844
He didn't know anything.

16:31.936 --> 16:34.025
Nothing but what
his father told him,

16:34.111 --> 16:36.317
and his father,
who suffered from delusions

16:36.403 --> 16:39.470
and paranoia and a host
of other mental illnesses,

16:39.556 --> 16:40.777
basically told him

16:40.863 --> 16:44.165
that anyone who was not
one of the two of them

16:44.251 --> 16:45.704
was bad and needed to die.

16:45.790 --> 16:47.808
He never said that!
He-he just... he said

16:47.894 --> 16:50.220
it was our land,
and we had to kill or be killed!

16:50.306 --> 16:52.876
Lucas. My dad taught me how to carve.
He taught me how to fish.

16:53.211 --> 16:54.330
Lucas. He-he taught me how to shoot.

16:54.415 --> 16:55.853
Counselor, control your client.

16:55.939 --> 16:59.638
They came on our land.
It was kill or be killed! Lucas.

17:00.543 --> 17:02.408
My apologies, Your Honor.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.321
As you can clearly see...

17:05.819 --> 17:07.493
my client is a victim

17:07.579 --> 17:09.932
of a cruel
and sadistic upbringing,

17:10.086 --> 17:12.204
one that kept the world
away at all costs.

17:12.290 --> 17:13.884
He simply doesn't
know any better.

17:13.999 --> 17:16.290
He couldn't possibly
have been expected

17:16.407 --> 17:17.673
to understand his rights

17:17.759 --> 17:20.525
or the consequences of speaking
without an attorney present.

17:20.611 --> 17:22.354
No, no, no, no, no!
They killed him!

17:22.440 --> 17:24.290
They came on our land,
and they killed him!

17:24.376 --> 17:25.901
Lucas, stop. We shot at them,

17:25.987 --> 17:27.127
- but they came on our land!
- Mr. Schwieger,

17:27.212 --> 17:28.876
I need you to stay
in your seat.

17:28.962 --> 17:31.634
And to refrain from speaking.
I didn't do nothing wrong!

17:31.720 --> 17:34.266
Officer, return Mr. Schwieger
to holding, please,

17:34.352 --> 17:35.571
immediately.

17:37.573 --> 17:40.009
It's okay. You need
to go with him.

17:40.930 --> 17:42.407
It's gonna be all right.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.079
Let's go.

17:54.973 --> 17:58.020
This is one of those moments
in a judge's life.

18:00.765 --> 18:03.509
So... let's talk law.

18:04.155 --> 18:07.563
I certainly see the validity
of your argument, Mr. Colón.

18:07.649 --> 18:09.446
"Knowing and voluntary
and intelligent"

18:09.532 --> 18:11.318
hardly describes
what went on here.

18:11.557 --> 18:14.430
Your motion to suppress
Mr. Schwieger's statement

18:14.516 --> 18:16.712
to the police
from evidence is granted.

18:16.798 --> 18:18.282
However...

18:18.368 --> 18:20.485
I'm not sure the omission
of the statement

18:20.571 --> 18:23.924
will matter much to the jury
if you can't rein in

18:24.010 --> 18:25.759
your client's behavior.

18:26.184 --> 18:27.415
Yes, Your Honor.

18:27.501 --> 18:29.079
Thank you, Your Honor.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.352
What did we get
ourselves into here?

18:35.172 --> 18:36.698
He couldn't even
keep it together

18:36.784 --> 18:38.587
for a ten-minute
motion hearing.

18:38.771 --> 18:40.204
How is he supposed
to make it

18:40.290 --> 18:42.735
through eight hours
a day of court?

18:44.933 --> 18:46.485
May I ask who's calling?

18:47.257 --> 18:48.587
This is he.

18:50.437 --> 18:51.960
I see.

18:53.305 --> 18:54.649
I see.

18:54.771 --> 18:56.601
No, I'll be right over.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.712
I very much
appreciate the call.

18:59.745 --> 19:01.355
Everything all right?

19:03.124 --> 19:05.085
Lucas is in the hospital.

19:05.396 --> 19:07.399
After he returned
from court today,

19:07.680 --> 19:09.399
he tried to hang himself.

19:20.501 --> 19:22.418
Sorry I'm late.

19:22.930 --> 19:24.524
What kind of
shape is he in?

19:24.680 --> 19:27.140
Well, at the moment,
he's heavily sedated.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.852
One of the other inmates
heard him choking

19:28.937 --> 19:30.523
and called out
to the guards.

19:30.609 --> 19:33.168
They cut him down
and resuscitated him.

19:33.374 --> 19:36.168
The good news is he's
going to be fine.

19:37.945 --> 19:40.327
So, anybody venturing a guess
about when he'll be awake,

19:40.413 --> 19:41.741
when I can get him
back in court?

19:41.826 --> 19:43.890
They're guessing his
sedation wouldn't wear off

19:43.976 --> 19:45.234
until midday tomorrow.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.390
Oh.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.456
So...
what now?

19:48.542 --> 19:50.846
Now we roar into the courtroom
tomorrow morning

19:50.932 --> 19:52.643
before the prosecution
is any wiser,

19:52.729 --> 19:54.590
and Benny files a motion
to try and keep all this

19:54.675 --> 19:56.331
from being introduced
into the record.

19:56.417 --> 19:58.643
Why? I mean, I'm no lawyer,

19:58.760 --> 20:00.479
but if I'm on the jury,

20:00.565 --> 20:02.120
doesn't the
idea that he

20:02.206 --> 20:05.284
almost tried to kill himself
make Lucas look...

20:05.565 --> 20:06.674
sympathetic?

20:06.760 --> 20:08.377
You'd think so, wouldn't you?

20:08.823 --> 20:10.727
But that's not how
the other side will spin it.

20:10.812 --> 20:12.050
They will claim it is proof

20:12.136 --> 20:14.228
Lucas felt guilty
about what he did,

20:14.314 --> 20:17.135
that he knows he did something
he shouldn't have,

20:17.221 --> 20:19.839
and since we're telling the jury
the exact opposite...

20:19.925 --> 20:21.299
That he didn't know
the difference

20:21.385 --> 20:22.565
between right and wrong...

20:22.650 --> 20:24.131
The trial would
effectively be over

20:24.216 --> 20:26.741
before we ever called a witness.

20:27.872 --> 20:29.458
That the suicide attempt is

20:29.544 --> 20:31.864
somehow connected to
this caseworker's death

20:31.950 --> 20:33.576
is pure speculation.

20:33.661 --> 20:35.997
I mean, look at everything this
young man has been through.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.101
He watched

20:37.186 --> 20:39.755
as his father was shot to death
right in front of him.

20:39.841 --> 20:41.122
He's been pulled away

20:41.208 --> 20:43.036
from the only home
he's ever known.

20:43.122 --> 20:45.841
He's spent this last week
either in a-a courtroom

20:45.927 --> 20:47.067
or a jail cell.

20:47.152 --> 20:49.372
If we are going to hypothesize,

20:49.458 --> 20:50.544
shouldn't we say

20:50.630 --> 20:54.552
that maybe depression is the
cause of... of this behavior?

20:54.833 --> 20:56.083
Your Honor,

20:56.169 --> 20:57.474
Dr. Jason Bull.

20:57.560 --> 20:59.607
I'm part of the defense team
and a doctor of psychology.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.079
I know who you are, Dr. Bull.

21:01.165 --> 21:03.478
Well,
in my professional opinion,

21:03.564 --> 21:05.563
it's likely that this child
tried to kill himself

21:05.649 --> 21:09.470
because the only man he knew,
the only man he trusted,

21:09.603 --> 21:11.396
his father,
was being referred to

21:11.481 --> 21:14.834
as the person most responsible
for his own death

21:14.919 --> 21:16.368
and his son's incarceration.

21:16.454 --> 21:19.415
Now, this man was the boy's God.
His North Star.

21:19.501 --> 21:22.506
Everything he knew about life
he learned from this man,

21:22.604 --> 21:25.218
and to hear that he could be
so profoundly wrong

21:25.697 --> 21:27.729
had to be cataclysmic for him

21:27.900 --> 21:30.763
and was surely reason enough
for him to consider

21:30.848 --> 21:32.697
taking his own life.

21:35.324 --> 21:37.900
I'm not sure what I believe
the boy was thinking.

21:37.986 --> 21:40.817
Respectfully,
that's for the jury to decide.

21:41.143 --> 21:43.036
And they won't get to
decide if we withhold

21:43.122 --> 21:45.777
the defendant's suicide
attempt from them.

21:47.604 --> 21:50.049
I agree with the defense,

21:50.135 --> 21:52.350
and I find
the prejudicial impact

21:52.435 --> 21:55.018
outweighs the probative value.

21:55.627 --> 21:58.979
The attempted suicide will not
be allowed into evidence.

21:59.385 --> 22:00.643
When will the defendant

22:00.729 --> 22:02.689
be available
so that the trial can resume?

22:02.775 --> 22:04.493
We will get you the answer
to that question

22:04.578 --> 22:06.330
as soon as possible, Your Honor.

22:07.938 --> 22:09.893
I am so sorry.

22:09.979 --> 22:12.370
It's amazing what he can
do in a split second.

22:12.455 --> 22:13.763
It's fine.

22:13.894 --> 22:15.330
Here, Mommy.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.150
How old is he?

22:20.252 --> 22:21.336
22 months.

22:21.421 --> 22:23.250
Uh, almost two.

22:23.335 --> 22:25.143
Two years since I've had
a full night's sleep.

22:25.229 --> 22:26.775
Two years since
I've read a book.

22:26.861 --> 22:28.263
Two years since I've
been to the gym.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.784
You have kids?

22:30.586 --> 22:31.854
Yeah, I can tell.

22:31.953 --> 22:33.611
You lack frazzle.

22:35.132 --> 22:36.742
Bye.

22:41.392 --> 22:42.878
Well, turns out
the nearest neighbors

22:42.964 --> 22:44.604
are almost a quarter mile away.

22:44.690 --> 22:46.143
They seemed to know that
there was a teenager

22:46.228 --> 22:47.433
and an old man
living near them,

22:47.518 --> 22:49.486
but they said that they'd
sometimes hear gunfire,

22:49.572 --> 22:51.275
so they kept their distance.

22:51.619 --> 22:52.715
Maybe there's someone

22:52.800 --> 22:54.104
from their past.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.018
He told me his mother
hung herself when he was little.

22:57.104 --> 22:58.433
I'll bet that's where
he got the idea.

22:58.518 --> 23:00.765
- How horrible.
- Maybe there's someone

23:00.851 --> 23:02.565
who knew her, who was friends
with her before she...

23:02.650 --> 23:04.262
That
would be great.

23:04.454 --> 23:07.182
Someone we could
get to testify

23:07.268 --> 23:09.601
to how Lucas had a
normal life at one time

23:09.686 --> 23:12.736
and a completely isolated
one once the mother passed.

23:13.205 --> 23:14.861
I know it drives
the kid crazy,

23:14.947 --> 23:16.245
but we have to keep
hammering away

23:16.330 --> 23:18.111
at what a lunatic
the father was.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.723
What about the person who called
Child Protective Services?

23:20.871 --> 23:21.961
There's a reason why

23:22.046 --> 23:23.355
these folks went out
to take a look.

23:23.440 --> 23:25.135
Someone had to have
called in a complaint.

23:25.244 --> 23:27.783
Yep. A woman named
Yvonne Fowler.

23:27.869 --> 23:28.807
She won't take my calls,

23:28.893 --> 23:30.550
and she doesn't answer the door
when I visit her house,

23:30.635 --> 23:32.322
but I haven't given up.

23:32.408 --> 23:34.229
Well, I'm about to.
I'm exhausted.

23:34.315 --> 23:36.319
Court's back in session
first thing in the morning.

23:36.405 --> 23:38.059
You don't have
to tell me twice.

23:43.282 --> 23:46.200
My son is obsessed
with sending me poop emojis.

23:46.441 --> 23:48.141
I wonder if it means something.

23:48.227 --> 23:50.307
You are always on duty,
aren't you?

23:50.642 --> 23:51.896
On duty?

23:52.076 --> 23:53.705
That's a joke, right?

23:56.018 --> 23:57.721
Hey, let me ask you something.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.042
How'd you know
you wanted to have kids?

24:00.360 --> 24:01.826
Was it something...

24:02.229 --> 24:03.479
you just felt in your soul,

24:03.565 --> 24:06.135
or did you just sense
it was the right time?

24:06.317 --> 24:08.838
Neither. It was more like
a three-martini night,

24:08.924 --> 24:10.711
and nine months later
we needed a crib.

24:11.298 --> 24:12.471
I mean,

24:12.557 --> 24:13.647
it wasn't planned,

24:13.749 --> 24:16.623
but wouldn't trade it
for anything.

24:17.002 --> 24:18.450
You getting an itch?

24:19.596 --> 24:21.205
Not even a tickle.

24:21.628 --> 24:22.729
Greg?

24:23.536 --> 24:25.213
He wants what I want.

24:25.491 --> 24:27.330
At least, that's what he says.

24:27.518 --> 24:29.376
And you don't know
what you want.

24:29.743 --> 24:31.127
No.

24:31.752 --> 24:32.869
I envy you.

24:32.963 --> 24:34.760
Really? Why?

24:34.945 --> 24:36.643
It feels terrible
from in here.

24:37.158 --> 24:40.533
Because no matter what happens,
no matter what you do,

24:40.658 --> 24:42.424
it's gonna be wonderful.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.769
You're either gonna get
what you want,

24:45.854 --> 24:48.268
or you're gonna...
get what you want.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.447
The people would like to call
Yvonne Fowler to the stand.

24:55.679 --> 24:57.031
Yvonne Fowler?

24:57.155 --> 24:59.432
Isn't she the one Danny said
called in the complaint

24:59.518 --> 25:00.596
to Child Services?

25:00.682 --> 25:03.135
Looks like she took
the prosecution's call.

25:06.258 --> 25:07.478
I know her.

25:07.564 --> 25:08.764
Ms. Fowler,

25:09.104 --> 25:11.354
could you please tell the
court how you came to meet

25:11.440 --> 25:12.965
Lucas Schwieger?

25:13.666 --> 25:16.314
I'm a nurse
at St. Benjamin's Hospital,

25:16.400 --> 25:19.709
which is about five miles from
where Norman and Lucas lived.

25:20.080 --> 25:22.473
A few months ago,
Norman showed up

25:22.558 --> 25:24.678
in the middle of the night
at the hospital with Lucas.

25:24.822 --> 25:27.104
Norman had walking pneumonia.

25:27.206 --> 25:29.229
Once we got Norman checked in,

25:29.590 --> 25:31.986
I realized
Lucas had nowhere to go.

25:32.079 --> 25:34.562
So I brought him
home with me,

25:34.648 --> 25:36.923
thinking it would just be
for a day or so.

25:37.190 --> 25:40.618
But one day turned into two,
two turned into a week,

25:40.704 --> 25:44.399
and Lucas ended up staying
with us for three weeks.

25:44.536 --> 25:46.352
- And when you say "us"?
- Oh.

25:46.438 --> 25:47.876
My husband and two children.

25:48.236 --> 25:50.227
Boys. Seven and nine.

25:50.313 --> 25:52.220
So, when the defense
claims Mr. Schwieger

25:52.306 --> 25:54.829
spent his whole
life in isolation,

25:54.981 --> 25:56.970
that simply isn't true, is it?

25:57.125 --> 25:58.915
I don't know anything
about his whole life.

25:59.001 --> 26:00.709
Well, but you can
categorically state

26:00.795 --> 26:02.146
that he lived with you?

26:02.467 --> 26:04.747
Had running water,
home-cooked meals,

26:04.926 --> 26:08.060
slept in a warm bed
for a period

26:08.212 --> 26:09.724
of three weeks?

26:09.975 --> 26:11.154
Yes, he did.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.076
Now, you're very
active in your church,

26:13.162 --> 26:14.557
aren't you, Ms. Fowler?

26:14.691 --> 26:16.326
Our whole family is.

26:16.412 --> 26:17.981
I teach Sunday school.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.213
During the three weeks
Lucas lived with you,

26:21.303 --> 26:22.650
did you ever take
him to church?

26:22.736 --> 26:24.044
Every Sunday.

26:24.392 --> 26:27.092
He said he'd never stepped
inside a church before,

26:27.318 --> 26:29.892
and he seemed to like it.

26:30.197 --> 26:33.056
The singing,
the shaking hands, the sermon.

26:33.281 --> 26:34.885
My boys showed him how

26:34.971 --> 26:36.697
to put money
in the plate.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.767
Hard to know
if this is good or bad

26:38.853 --> 26:39.955
for our side.

26:40.041 --> 26:42.345
Anything that suggests
Lucas knew right from wrong

26:42.431 --> 26:43.956
- is not a help.
- So, I'm curious.

26:44.042 --> 26:46.353
Did you ever take Mr. Schwieger
with you to Sunday school?

26:46.439 --> 26:47.752
Yes, I did once.

26:47.875 --> 26:49.010
Could you tell the
court what lessons

26:49.095 --> 26:50.361
were being taught that Sunday?

26:50.447 --> 26:52.799
We talked
about the Ten Commandments.

26:53.155 --> 26:55.769
And that particular week
was the fifth commandment:

26:56.447 --> 26:58.275
thou shalt not kill.

27:01.392 --> 27:02.657
Jury's slipping away.

27:02.876 --> 27:04.291
They're starting to sense

27:04.377 --> 27:05.643
that he's seen
enough of the world

27:05.728 --> 27:07.136
to know the difference
between right and wrong.

27:07.221 --> 27:08.355
You don't just shoot people

27:08.441 --> 27:10.053
when they show up in
front of your house.

27:10.139 --> 27:11.880
So, how'd it go in there?

27:12.915 --> 27:14.330
We've had better days.

27:14.416 --> 27:16.487
You still interested in making
the father the villain?

27:16.572 --> 27:19.470
I'm not sure it much matters
to the jury at this point.

27:19.556 --> 27:20.815
Maybe that's because
they haven't heard

27:20.900 --> 27:22.905
- the really bad stuff.
- Really bad stuff? Like what?

27:22.990 --> 27:25.385
Like, how about
telling a child his whole life

27:25.471 --> 27:29.314
that his mother is dead
when she's actually alive.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.869
You good if I smoke?

27:40.641 --> 27:41.805
Anybody thirsty?

27:41.891 --> 27:44.541
We're fine. We just wanted
to ask you a few questions

27:44.627 --> 27:47.135
about your ex-husband, Norman,
and your son, Lucas.

27:47.350 --> 27:50.627
Oh, well, I mean,
I'll tell you everything I know.

27:51.569 --> 27:53.283
Did you know that Norman died?

27:53.768 --> 27:55.541
Shot by a state trooper.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.541
And that your son, Lucas,
is on trial for murder?

28:01.027 --> 28:02.616
No, I didn't know that.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.940
You aware that your son
thinks you're dead?

28:05.846 --> 28:07.187
Well, I'm not surprised.

28:07.273 --> 28:08.538
You ever meet his father?

28:08.624 --> 28:09.874
Never had the pleasure.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.609
What can you tell
me about him?

28:12.246 --> 28:14.250
Uh, he's crazy.

28:14.569 --> 28:15.632
I just finally said,

28:15.718 --> 28:18.287
"I'm gonna take Lucas
and leave."

28:18.373 --> 28:19.986
And how'd Norman
feel about that?

28:20.072 --> 28:21.726
Oh, that night
I woke up

28:21.812 --> 28:24.163
and find Norman on top of me
with a pistol in my mouth.

28:24.249 --> 28:26.398
And he said if I ever tried
to take the boy,

28:26.484 --> 28:28.343
he was gonna kill both of us.

28:29.071 --> 28:30.937
How old was Lucas?

28:31.218 --> 28:32.929
He'd just turned three.

28:33.827 --> 28:36.976
So, that night,
the second he fell asleep,

28:37.234 --> 28:38.257
I was out the window.

28:38.343 --> 28:40.882
I didn't even kiss
my baby good-bye.

28:42.741 --> 28:44.210
I know it's been a long time,

28:44.296 --> 28:45.656
but we need your
son's jury to hear

28:45.741 --> 28:48.046
what it was like to
live with that man,

28:48.132 --> 28:50.999
to hear the story
you just told us.

28:51.624 --> 28:52.928
Yeah, I don't think so.

28:53.014 --> 28:55.093
I got a really busy schedule.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.726
You have a drug problem,
Mrs. Schwieger?

28:57.812 --> 28:59.515
It's not a problem for me.

28:59.648 --> 29:01.386
Okay, I'm gonna step outside.

29:01.472 --> 29:02.735
She's gonna stay
in here with you.

29:02.820 --> 29:04.289
I want you to put on
the closest thing you have

29:04.374 --> 29:05.456
to a decent dress,

29:05.542 --> 29:07.597
and then we are going
to the courthouse.

29:07.683 --> 29:09.316
And don't try going
out the window.

29:09.635 --> 29:11.355
She's ex-FBI.

29:15.784 --> 29:17.125
She could be anybody.

29:17.211 --> 29:18.432
But she isn't.

29:18.518 --> 29:20.607
- Can I smoke?
- No.

29:22.956 --> 29:24.324
She's gonna tell the jury

29:24.410 --> 29:26.410
what life was like with
your father before she left.

29:26.495 --> 29:27.879
And you're not gonna like
hearing it,

29:27.964 --> 29:30.050
but I need you to promise
that you will not react.

29:30.136 --> 29:32.808
No noises. No faces.

29:33.019 --> 29:35.706
No standing. No talking.

29:37.674 --> 29:39.632
Don't worry, I
won't do nothing.

29:43.213 --> 29:44.474
I don't even know her.

29:45.886 --> 29:47.105
He knocked me around

29:47.191 --> 29:48.651
all the time.

29:48.737 --> 29:50.003
Wouldn't let us go out.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.284
He didn't trust anyone.

29:51.370 --> 29:54.292
Objection, Your Honor.
What does any of this have to do

29:54.440 --> 29:56.559
with whether or not Lucas
Schwieger shot a police officer?

29:56.644 --> 29:58.370
If it pleases the court,

29:58.456 --> 30:00.612
in order to understand
what happened

30:00.698 --> 30:02.894
the day of the shooting,
we have to understand

30:02.980 --> 30:05.339
what kind of environment
Lucas came from.

30:05.597 --> 30:06.802
Overruled.

30:07.089 --> 30:08.499
Now, you were saying...

30:08.584 --> 30:10.972
He just got stranger
and stranger.

30:11.120 --> 30:14.375
He-he stopped letting me
leave the cabin at all.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.986
He... he rigged up alarms

30:17.071 --> 30:19.175
so that he would know
if somebody came and went.

30:19.261 --> 30:20.337
He said that
the government

30:20.422 --> 30:22.323
was watching him
from satellites.

30:22.409 --> 30:23.543
From space?

30:23.629 --> 30:27.113
Yeah. Sometimes at
night he'd go outside,

30:27.299 --> 30:29.042
and-and he'd scream at them.

30:29.127 --> 30:31.097
He'd shoot his guns
up in the air.

30:31.183 --> 30:32.823
I mean, I was scared
all the time.

30:32.909 --> 30:34.237
It was no way to live.

30:34.323 --> 30:37.050
And it probably wasn't any
better for Lucas, either.

30:37.300 --> 30:40.026
Thank you. No further questions,
Your Honor.

30:40.112 --> 30:41.316
Well, that made an impact.

30:41.402 --> 30:43.425
No reds have flipped green,
but I can see

30:43.511 --> 30:45.980
that their attitudes
about Lucas are in flux.

30:46.105 --> 30:49.336
For the first time,
they're sympathizing with him.

30:50.504 --> 30:53.214
Let's take a moment
and talk about your past.

30:53.498 --> 30:55.519
Are you
the same Brenda Schwieger

30:55.605 --> 30:58.566
who was convicted
of forging checks?

30:58.878 --> 31:01.509
Sentenced
to court-appointed rehab twice?

31:02.097 --> 31:04.472
Hasn't had a full-time
job in almost 20 years?

31:04.558 --> 31:05.774
And you expect this jury

31:05.859 --> 31:07.259
to believe anything
you have to say?

31:07.589 --> 31:08.722
You got me.

31:08.808 --> 31:10.441
I don't even want to be here.

31:10.550 --> 31:12.520
I just was told that I had to.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.472
But I'll tell you this.

31:15.072 --> 31:17.198
My husband ruined me.

31:17.870 --> 31:20.714
I used to be a human being.

31:20.894 --> 31:23.444
So whatever kind of person
Lucas has become,

31:23.529 --> 31:27.100
trust me, it's because
his father got him there.

31:27.284 --> 31:29.537
If my little baby
has become a killer,

31:29.684 --> 31:32.077
it's because his father
turned him into one.

31:40.792 --> 31:42.347
She was good.

31:42.581 --> 31:43.836
You think it was enough?

31:43.922 --> 31:45.308
No.

31:45.815 --> 31:47.334
But I have an idea.

31:48.284 --> 31:49.605
So these are of

31:49.691 --> 31:50.870
the inside of the cabin.

31:50.956 --> 31:52.589
As you can see,
it's pretty spartan.

31:52.862 --> 31:54.083
You can use these to show

31:54.168 --> 31:56.216
the jury how little stimulation
was available.

31:56.301 --> 31:59.262
No books, no
radio, no TV.

31:59.768 --> 32:01.580
Obviously,
no computers.

32:01.774 --> 32:05.073
And most importantly,
no outlets for learning.

32:05.807 --> 32:07.925
All right, so these are
the air horns and the trip wires

32:08.010 --> 32:09.651
Norman installed
around the property

32:09.737 --> 32:11.174
to ward
against intruders.

32:11.260 --> 32:13.909
Got it.
Helps demonstrate the paranoia.

32:13.995 --> 32:15.784
Fear of outsiders,
the isolation.

32:15.870 --> 32:17.198
Ready for the
next series?

32:17.287 --> 32:18.979
Fire when ready.

32:24.001 --> 32:25.505
What are we looking at here?

32:25.838 --> 32:27.508
It's a
homemade target range.

32:27.674 --> 32:29.479
Metal head
and torso silhouettes.

32:29.565 --> 32:31.885
By the way,
the police dusted all of this.

32:31.971 --> 32:33.838
The guns, the targets.

32:33.924 --> 32:36.455
Lucas's fingerprints
were everywhere.

32:36.558 --> 32:38.627
His father's? Norman's?

32:38.737 --> 32:40.143
Not so much.

32:41.722 --> 32:43.002
Wow.

32:43.696 --> 32:45.619
All those bull's-eyes.

32:45.807 --> 32:47.385
One on top of the other.
Looks like

32:47.471 --> 32:48.846
Lucas was quite the shot.

32:48.987 --> 32:51.643
How far away would you say
the targets were

32:51.729 --> 32:53.511
from the stand where Lucas
would have been shooting from?

32:53.596 --> 32:55.492
- Had to be at least 50 yards.
- I'm not sure

32:55.577 --> 32:58.306
we really want the jury looking
at this target range.

32:58.537 --> 33:00.174
I mean, it's kind of horrific.

33:00.260 --> 33:02.666
Kind of like looking
at a murderer's training ground.

33:02.889 --> 33:04.658
Actually, I disagree.

33:05.035 --> 33:07.681
I think this is exactly
what the jury needs to see.

33:07.767 --> 33:10.377
Okay. Well, how are we
gonna get all this in?

33:10.462 --> 33:11.494
Who's on the stand?

33:11.580 --> 33:13.323
Can't just stand up
in front of a court

33:13.409 --> 33:15.556
and show photos
without any context.

33:15.642 --> 33:17.400
We need somebody
to authenticate them,

33:17.486 --> 33:19.664
to say that this is really
where Lucas lived,

33:19.819 --> 33:21.439
that this is really
what it looked like.

33:21.525 --> 33:23.527
Who are we gonna
get to do that?

33:25.996 --> 33:28.486
I was thinking... Lucas.

33:35.768 --> 33:37.174
Good morning, Lucas.

33:37.705 --> 33:39.713
First time
in a witness box?

33:40.721 --> 33:42.041
Yes.

33:42.455 --> 33:45.556
Well, you know
how this works, right?

33:45.861 --> 33:48.306
They made you raise your
right hand a moment ago, and

33:48.392 --> 33:49.838
you promised
to tell the truth.

33:49.971 --> 33:51.494
You understand that,
don't you?

33:51.728 --> 33:52.884
Yes.

33:53.252 --> 33:54.594
All right.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.431
Now...

33:57.429 --> 33:59.127
Does this picture...?

33:59.983 --> 34:02.225
Does this look
familiar to you?

34:02.535 --> 34:04.452
Does it look
like a place you know?

34:05.482 --> 34:06.774
Yes.

34:07.326 --> 34:08.710
It's behind my house.

34:08.918 --> 34:10.451
It's a target range.

34:11.038 --> 34:13.216
Right? A place where...

34:13.514 --> 34:15.522
people practice shooting guns?

34:16.067 --> 34:17.342
Yes.

34:17.489 --> 34:18.927
You shoot there a lot?

34:19.364 --> 34:21.049
Pretty much almost every day.

34:21.135 --> 34:22.295
All right.

34:22.645 --> 34:25.686
Now how far was that target
from where you shot?

34:27.842 --> 34:28.896
Uh, I-I don't get you.

34:28.982 --> 34:32.277
How many steps? I mean,
if you had to take a guess.

34:33.021 --> 34:34.342
Um...

34:35.380 --> 34:36.500
at least a hundred.

34:36.585 --> 34:37.679
Okay.

34:37.766 --> 34:41.279
And how far away from the house
was the state trooper

34:41.428 --> 34:43.594
and the lady
he brought with him?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.596
The one your dad shot?

34:46.130 --> 34:47.597
Maybe...

34:47.920 --> 34:49.475
20 steps.

34:50.052 --> 34:51.253
Never really counted.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.154
Objection. Relevance?

34:53.428 --> 34:56.428
If the court would just indulge
me for a moment more, please?

34:56.514 --> 34:57.605
Overruled.

34:57.691 --> 34:59.162
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:00.397 --> 35:02.623
Do you recognize
this picture?

35:03.639 --> 35:05.084
That's what I shoot at.

35:05.294 --> 35:06.795
So these are your bullet holes?

35:06.886 --> 35:07.998
I'm the only one

35:08.084 --> 35:09.117
who shoots there.

35:09.203 --> 35:10.373
Huh.

35:10.976 --> 35:15.881
So if you shoot at these targets
pretty much every day,

35:16.190 --> 35:18.889
and they're at least
a hundred feet away,

35:19.837 --> 35:22.287
why'd you shoot
that state trooper in the leg?

35:29.540 --> 35:31.936
The witness will answer
the question. Oh, that's all right.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.686
I'll rephrase.

35:34.061 --> 35:37.272
Didn't your father tell you,
"It's kill or be killed"?

35:40.692 --> 35:41.668
Again,

35:41.754 --> 35:43.201
the witness will answer
the question.

35:43.287 --> 35:45.127
I'll withdraw the question.
Let me ask another.

35:45.912 --> 35:47.881
Do you recognize the phrase,

35:47.967 --> 35:49.928
"thou shalt not kill"?

35:50.520 --> 35:52.131
Have you heard that before?

35:53.138 --> 35:54.488
Yes.

35:54.574 --> 35:56.099
Sunday school, right?

35:57.232 --> 35:58.407
Yes.

35:58.493 --> 35:59.624
And did it go
through your mind

35:59.709 --> 36:02.363
when your father told you,
"Kill or be killed"?

36:06.987 --> 36:08.217
Lucas?

36:11.581 --> 36:13.037
Yes.

36:14.217 --> 36:16.732
That's why you shot
that state trooper in the leg

36:17.365 --> 36:19.217
and not through
the head or the heart

36:19.303 --> 36:21.561
like you've been practicing
your whole life to do?

36:21.943 --> 36:23.256
Yes.

36:26.537 --> 36:27.715
Thank you, Your Honor.

36:27.942 --> 36:29.380
No further questions.

36:29.466 --> 36:31.772
Let's take
a 20-minute recess.

36:38.489 --> 36:40.058
Did you bring me in here
to gloat?

36:40.143 --> 36:42.183
I brought you in here
to see if we could cut a deal.

36:42.514 --> 36:43.756
A deal?

36:44.278 --> 36:45.756
Why would you want
to make a deal?

36:45.842 --> 36:47.937
The jury is almost
certainly going to vote

36:48.023 --> 36:49.632
to let the boy go free.

36:50.062 --> 36:52.331
Because I'm not
necessarily convinced

36:52.416 --> 36:54.288
that that's
the best thing for him.

36:56.687 --> 36:58.765
Seemed like you guys
were talking for an hour.

36:58.851 --> 36:59.898
Where's he going?

36:59.984 --> 37:01.945
To tell the judge
the good news.

37:02.108 --> 37:03.210
We're done.

37:03.296 --> 37:05.273
No more jail,
no more court.

37:06.593 --> 37:07.977
Yvonne,

37:08.063 --> 37:11.570
the woman you stayed with
for three weeks, has agreed

37:11.664 --> 37:14.242
to let you live with her and
her family until you're 18.

37:14.426 --> 37:16.898
It's what we
call "probation."

37:17.883 --> 37:19.711
It's kind of like a test

37:19.797 --> 37:22.328
to see if you can
follow the rules, and...

37:23.074 --> 37:24.609
you don't have
any problems.

37:24.695 --> 37:26.562
And the A.D.A. and I
would also like you

37:26.648 --> 37:30.727
to see Dr. Statton
once a week.

37:30.813 --> 37:32.203
You remember her
from the hospital?

37:32.289 --> 37:33.596
She introduced us?

37:33.699 --> 37:35.172
She's a good doctor.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.492
A doctor for
your feelings.

37:37.638 --> 37:39.305
Someone for you
to talk to.

37:41.189 --> 37:42.335
Okay.

37:42.523 --> 37:43.727
That's it?

37:44.205 --> 37:45.643
It's a pretty terrific deal.

37:45.729 --> 37:46.781
Nice work.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.055
I didn't do it.
Lucas did.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.039
He got on the stand
and told the truth.

37:53.050 --> 37:54.555
But I can't go home?

37:56.393 --> 37:58.055
Not to your old home, no.

38:00.118 --> 38:01.828
It was never really yours.

38:02.003 --> 38:04.742
Your father
was a squatter.

38:04.884 --> 38:07.078
A person who
lives someplace,

38:07.361 --> 38:08.914
but doesn't
really own it.

38:09.273 --> 38:11.062
That's why he was
so protective of it.

38:11.181 --> 38:13.141
The guns, the alarms.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.203
He knew he wasn't
supposed to be there.

38:17.200 --> 38:18.477
I'm sorry.

38:22.367 --> 38:23.844
The judge agreed.

38:28.582 --> 38:30.594
Does this mean
I can go to school now?

38:31.037 --> 38:33.042
I'm sure we can
figure something out.

38:33.819 --> 38:35.216
Learn to read?

38:35.352 --> 38:37.930
Oh, I'm sure
whatever school you end up at,

38:38.040 --> 38:39.945
they'd love
to help you with that.

38:40.142 --> 38:43.365
Hey, you ever been
to a restaurant?

38:43.488 --> 38:44.710
What's that?

38:44.900 --> 38:48.645
Well, you ever been
to a celebration?

38:48.862 --> 38:50.023
I-I don't know.

38:50.109 --> 38:52.078
What does one look like?

38:52.287 --> 38:54.828
Oh, you've got your whole life
ahead of you.

38:55.174 --> 38:56.836
So much great stuff.

39:00.779 --> 39:02.781
Ask me about work today.

39:05.433 --> 39:06.867
Okay.

39:08.107 --> 39:09.641
How was work today?

39:09.754 --> 39:11.234
We've been working on this case.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.629
This kid... he's, like, 16.

39:13.732 --> 39:16.383
Completely lost
the parent lottery.

39:16.890 --> 39:18.807
Up on murder charges.

39:18.916 --> 39:20.430
Mother's a junkie.

39:20.781 --> 39:22.359
Father was a delusional paranoid

39:22.445 --> 39:24.508
who thought
the world was coming to an end.

39:25.569 --> 39:27.310
And your point?

39:28.132 --> 39:30.049
It scares me.

39:31.593 --> 39:34.023
His parents must have been
in love once upon a time,

39:34.109 --> 39:36.155
or at the very least, in lust.

39:36.962 --> 39:40.375
This kid was... born a baby.

39:41.134 --> 39:43.867
A cute, beautiful baby.

39:45.709 --> 39:48.016
How did it all go so wrong?

39:49.124 --> 39:50.336
If God is so smart,

39:50.422 --> 39:53.961
why does he or she let people
like that have children,

39:54.134 --> 39:55.914
let alone be attracted
to each other?

39:56.000 --> 39:59.397
You are so much smarter
than that question suggests.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.429
Maybe I'm not.

40:03.484 --> 40:06.305
Maybe I'm not really any of
the things I like to think I am.

40:06.391 --> 40:08.258
I mean...

40:09.058 --> 40:10.906
look at my parents.

40:12.010 --> 40:13.820
Look at what happened to me.

40:16.569 --> 40:21.289
So this is how we're gonna
make this momentous decision.

40:21.904 --> 40:25.633
In the middle of the
night, half asleep.

40:27.201 --> 40:28.891
I don't know.

40:30.470 --> 40:32.289
Do you have an opinion?

40:33.985 --> 40:35.687
Actually, I do.

40:38.958 --> 40:42.758
I'm as frightened as you are...
of failing.

40:43.148 --> 40:46.750
I'm... terrified

40:46.924 --> 40:50.297
at the prospect of letting
another human being down.

40:52.090 --> 40:54.267
But there's also a part of me
that thinks it would be scary

40:54.352 --> 40:56.963
and dangerous
if I didn't have those fears.

40:59.317 --> 41:01.047
So what are you saying?

41:03.862 --> 41:06.195
I'm saying...

41:07.436 --> 41:10.787
your parents robbed
you of so much.

41:11.659 --> 41:14.180
Don't let them
rob you of this.

41:15.372 --> 41:17.039
This choice.

41:18.576 --> 41:21.781
If you don't want to
have a baby, let's not.

41:22.325 --> 41:25.807
But if you're afraid of having a
baby because of your parents...

41:28.032 --> 41:29.703
then I'm gonna
force you to have a baby

41:29.789 --> 41:31.391
just to prove you wrong.

41:32.787 --> 41:35.139
You and what army?

41:35.724 --> 41:37.703
Mm. Come here.

41:39.588 --> 41:41.141
I want to start
right now.

41:41.227 --> 41:44.070
You understand
this is not how this works.

41:44.156 --> 41:46.117
We go to an office.

41:46.352 --> 41:47.609
We don't do
it like this?

41:47.695 --> 41:48.977
Well, they show you porn.

41:49.063 --> 41:51.641
Porn? Really?

41:52.498 --> 41:53.977
Wow.

41:54.623 --> 41:56.891
The things we do
for our kids.
