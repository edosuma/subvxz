00:04.045 --> 00:06.256
<i>Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.</i>

00:12.804 --> 00:14.556
You're a rookie. You listen to me.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.599
I listen to the baby. Got it?

00:17.100 --> 00:18.226
So I'm lower than the baby?

00:18.309 --> 00:20.812
-This is Hooch.
-Grandpa wanted you to have him.

00:20.895 --> 00:22.981
Laura, I cannot take care of a dog.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.524
I'm in the middle of a big case.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.735
Hooch! No, no, no. No!

00:26.818 --> 00:28.236
-What?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.489
Maybe you should've chose a different day
to bring your dog to work.

00:31.573 --> 00:35.201
I run the K-9 explosives detection
training for the Marshal Service.

00:35.285 --> 00:37.120
If there's any way you can help me
with Hooch.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.997
Please, I'm-- I'm desperate.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.249
Dogs can tell if we're nervous,
or when we need love.

00:41.332 --> 00:43.585
I'm sorry.
You probably have tons of girlfriends.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.045
I don't.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.964
When I went back to that dumpster,
why did Hooch go straight for the mask?

00:48.048 --> 00:50.342
<i>Because he smelled Agent Long.</i>

00:50.425 --> 00:52.969
And Hooch figured it out all by himself.

00:56.139 --> 01:00.894
Because of Hooch's service, the two of you
are a K-9 Unit, effective immediately.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.354
<i>Hey, Scott. I'm at Mom's.</i>

01:02.437 --> 01:05.190
I think Dad was working on a case
before the heart attack.

01:05.273 --> 01:08.193
I think he was onto something scary enough
he didn't wanna tell anyone.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.702
Five more minutes.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.089
Hooch, no! That's $300.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.427
Good morning to you too.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.683
-That's better than yesterday.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.226
It's better than yesterday.

01:41.309 --> 01:42.227
All right.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
Okay, everybody.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.943
For you newbies, I'm Trent Havelock,
deputy in charge today.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.236
As you may have heard,

02:33.319 --> 02:35.613
the Olympic Committee is in town
for a couple days.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.283
Now, there has been
some chatter about threats,

02:38.366 --> 02:40.493
so we're helping the SFPD with security.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.080
The committee is staying
at The Bay Area Royal.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.875
That's a downtown hotel
that just finished a renovation,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.127
so they will be the only guests.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.337
We'll sweep that today.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.047
Then, we'll split into two teams.

02:52.130 --> 02:58.136
B-team, that's Baxter, X, dog man,
stays back at the hotel.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.306
As deputy in charge,
I take the A-team with me.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.391
Now, the A-team is the T-Squad,

03:03.475 --> 03:05.477
the group in the corner, you guys...

03:05.560 --> 03:08.146
Well, it's everybody.
It's everybody but the B-team.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.275
All of the chatter has been about...
city hall.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.862
-That's where the meeting's going down.
-That's right! It's going down.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.697
-Yeah.
-Yeah, squad!

03:18.448 --> 03:19.783
A-team! A-team!
-Yeah, squad!

03:19.866 --> 03:21.826
-Squad!
That's what I'm talking about.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.411
Okay, hey! This threat is serious.

03:23.495 --> 03:26.247
If that meeting gets hit,
we're going to hit back hard.

03:26.331 --> 03:27.999
T-Squad, convene.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.088
Yo. Hey, hey. Why are we B-team?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.007
Oh, that's right.
Turner hasn't worked with Trent yet.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.759
-Why? What's his deal?

03:37.842 --> 03:41.513
Well, I'm pregnant and Trent's convinced
I'll give birth if I sneeze.

03:41.596 --> 03:45.392
You're not covered in Axe body spray,
and you don't use enough hair gel.

03:45.475 --> 03:48.186
And X doesn't really care
what team he's on. Right, X?

03:48.269 --> 03:49.521
Which makes Trent's head hurt.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.648
But-- But-- But we just had the big case.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.400
Okay. Cool off, rookie.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.568
It's not about just one case.

03:55.652 --> 03:58.196
You do the job that's in front of you.
Right, X?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.364
100%.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.659
You gotta surf your own wave.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.619
Sure. What?

04:05.870 --> 04:08.081
Hey, Turner, need to talk to you.

04:08.164 --> 04:10.542
Oh, uh, come here, Hooch.

04:10.625 --> 04:11.626
Yeah?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.545
Heard from Marshal Sickerman this morning.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.672
You and the dog made it
into his presentation

04:15.755 --> 04:17.257
to senior leadership on new ideas.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.425
Oh, that's great.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.594
Yeah. Well, it's a priority for him,
which makes it a priority for me.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.263
Which means you need to deliver.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.558
-Hooch is still learning, but he's very--

04:26.641 --> 04:28.309
-You know, where he is promising--
-Turner.

04:28.393 --> 04:30.854
Trent's got you guys
securing the hotel, right?

04:31.438 --> 04:32.689
This needs to go well.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.524
A lot of eyes on this.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.109
Got it.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.736
I love eyes.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.946
You have beautiful eyes.

04:40.030 --> 04:42.949
I don't know why I said that.
Got it, Chief. Won't let you down.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.952
Hooch. Hooch.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.662
There's a lot of eyes on this, Hooch.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.976
Okay, Hooch.
Hooch. Remember the training?

05:10.060 --> 05:12.645
-Training, buddy. No, no, no. No.
Yo, check this out.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.191
-Darius wants to buy a $900 stroller.
-No. Hooch.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.859
-Over here.
-That's crazy, right?

05:17.942 --> 05:19.903
I'm so-- Uh, sorry I can't--

05:19.986 --> 05:22.822
No, seriously.
This thing costs more than my first car.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.282
-Okay.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.910
-Oh, my Go-- Oh, wait.

05:26.993 --> 05:27.911
Ah.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.080
-Here's what I think of your stroller.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.169
Okay. Follow me.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.634
You see what those dogs are doing?
Working, sniffing for bombs.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.718
Be like that.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.345
I believe in you.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.764
Sir, sir. The-- The dog.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.225
Sorry. He smells the food on your cart.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.851
-Yeah.
-Come here, Hooch.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.813
For the, uh... drool.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.024
Thanks.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.360
-And you're drooling, Hooch.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.488
This place already has one fountain.
It doesn't need another one.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.699
This is not a good look for us, Hooch.
You get that?

06:07.617 --> 06:08.868
Hooch! Hooch!

06:21.423 --> 06:23.341
No! Come back here.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.218
-Hooch! No!

06:25.301 --> 06:28.013
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't go in the fountain.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.556
-No! Uh...

06:29.639 --> 06:32.684
Okay, hey, Hooch. Get out right now.

06:34.519 --> 06:37.147
Just-- Please don't make me get in there.
All right.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.274
Okay. I--

06:39.357 --> 06:42.569
He's just checking the water
for contaminants.

06:42.652 --> 06:46.698
There's a lot of waterborne attacks
in San Francisco.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.117
Okay. Ugh.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.201
Okay.

06:50.285 --> 06:53.204
I'm so-- We're gonna-- O-Okay.
I'm just gonna--

06:54.622 --> 06:55.623
All right.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.126
He's still training.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.003
Hooch.

07:00.628 --> 07:03.548
That is the funniest dog in the world.
Is he yours?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.300
Uh, yeah. Unfortunately.

07:07.635 --> 07:08.678
Hooch, enough!

07:08.762 --> 07:10.972
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, sir.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.807
Maybe there's a towel or something.

07:12.891 --> 07:16.102
Kaya, get away from there.
You're going to get wet.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.479
Can I play with your dog?

07:17.562 --> 07:22.192
Oh, uh, Hooch? Well, uh, the thing is,
he's, um, he's working. So he can't play.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.653
He's making sure
that the carpet is, um, bomb-free.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.573
Sir. Sir. I am so sorry.

07:28.656 --> 07:30.158
-Give me one minute?
-Come on.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.535
Bro. What the hell?

07:32.619 --> 07:34.329
That was the head
of the Olympic Committee.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.830
Yeah. I-- I don't know what to say.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.957
-I tried to stop him.
-Yeah. Well, you didn't.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.918
Your dog chased a steak
into a water fountain.

07:40.001 --> 07:40.877
Yeah.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.380
This was your chance to show me
what you got. You let this happen.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.593
I think it's best for you and your dog
to take the rest of the day off, okay?

07:48.677 --> 07:51.221
-And you're paying for that steak, rookie.
-Yeah.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.515
Sir, again, my apologies.

07:53.598 --> 07:56.810
Let me assure you, he's new. His dog is...
I don't know what's wrong with it.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.437
But on the day, you're gonna have
the best of the best. The A-team.

07:59.521 --> 08:00.855
Seriously, man?

08:00.939 --> 08:03.525
How is it that I can't even get you
into a bath at home,

08:03.608 --> 08:06.444
but at work, you're all about jumping
into fountains, huh?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.948
We're not on the same page, Hooch.
We need to get on the same page.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.182
Hey, Scotty.
Thank you for coming. This is crazy.

08:36.266 --> 08:39.769
I've been looking through Dad's files,
and there's major criminals.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.982
There's smugglers and drug traffickers
and all this organized crime.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.901
I'm sorry. How was your day?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.237
It was... wet.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.239
I don't wanna get into it.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.033
Great. We can focus on the files?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.701
-Good.

08:54.784 --> 08:57.537
Based on everything
you've told me so far, I don't know.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.873
It just sounds like a bunch
of random criminals.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.041
Not sure I see a connection.

09:01.124 --> 09:04.627
Except that they were all found in the box
hidden in the back of Dad's closet.

09:04.711 --> 09:07.255
-You could say that's a connection.
-I know it's weird, but it's--

09:07.339 --> 09:10.050
I just feel like there's some
unfinished business here for Dad.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.635
Maybe. Yeah, maybe. Or maybe it's nothing.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.889
Right? I mean, look.
Dad's police work was what?

09:15.972 --> 09:18.016
Giving out speeding tickets
by the Dairy Queen.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.934
-I know, but...

09:20.685 --> 09:22.729
You think he was just doing
all of this for fun?

09:25.482 --> 09:26.483
Sorry.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.943
Uh, no. I don't.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.364
Maybe he was looking for a little
excitement in his golden years, you know?

09:32.447 --> 09:34.240
One last big case.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.284
What if he found it?

09:36.368 --> 09:38.912
I mean, what if this is his last big case?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.663
Am I supposed
to throw this in the dumpster

09:40.747 --> 09:42.582
with his copies of <i>Working Dog Magazine</i>?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.210
I know what you're thinking.

09:45.293 --> 09:47.462
"Flaky Laura, who never finishes anything.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.964
She'll give it up the next time
that a reality show

09:50.048 --> 09:51.925
about love on an island comes on."

09:52.008 --> 09:54.260
But I'm trying to change here, okay?

09:54.344 --> 09:57.347
It's about honoring Dad
and finishing what he started.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.641
Please, Scotty. Please.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.268
All right.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.396
All right. I'll look into it.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.648
Good. Okay.
We can do this together, for Dad.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.732
For Dad.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.862
Everything's in the fountain.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.657
-I'm wet. He's wet.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.283
It was a disaster.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.787
-Glad you think this is funny.
-No. I don't.

10:20.870 --> 10:24.249
I just got put on the streets here.
I really gotta prove myself.

10:24.332 --> 10:25.417
Yeah. I'm sorry.

10:25.500 --> 10:28.044
You know what?
I'm gonna wind up back on court security.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.089
Okay. Do you know the saying, um,
"watching paint dry"?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.967
Well, court security is guarding the paint
while it's drying.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.218
-Yeah.
-Oh, that sounds terrible.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.013
-He's gotta start taking this seriously.
-Okay.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.807
He needs to focus on work
and stop playing all the time.

10:40.890 --> 10:45.103
But dogs, they learn through play. Really,
work and play are the same for dogs.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.439
Oh, well,
then Hooch is due for a genius grant.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.484
Ah. You're so funny.

10:51.568 --> 10:56.031
Um...
I think that you need to have more fun.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.532
But how am I supposed to have fun

10:57.615 --> 10:59.868
when I'm trying to prove myself to,
like, everyone?

10:59.951 --> 11:02.871
Okay. Well, that's kind of the issue.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.081
It's like, you feel pressure

11:05.165 --> 11:07.083
and then he feels pressure.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.212
So, like, your job. Why do you do it?

11:11.796 --> 11:12.756
I--

11:12.839 --> 11:16.301
You know, when I was little,
my dad was like a local hero.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.803
You know, he solved this big case
before I was born.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.556
So, yeah. Of course. Yeah.
I wanted to be just like him.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.893
But he never did anything like that again,
you know?

11:24.976 --> 11:28.021
He was just, like, this small-town cop.

11:28.104 --> 11:30.523
And-- And I wanted to chase bad guys.

11:30.607 --> 11:33.026
That's what the marshals do. So...

11:33.610 --> 11:34.861
I joined.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.780
Wow. I, uh...

11:38.448 --> 11:40.700
I think you just have
a lot of feelings about this,

11:40.784 --> 11:43.119
and Hooch is probably
picking up on that a little.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.498
Oh, sorry.

11:46.581 --> 11:47.832
Oh.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.752
Oh, it's the chief.
Probably calling to fire me.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.837
-Oh.
-Hi, Chief. Uh...

11:52.921 --> 11:55.674
Look. A-About yesterday, I'm so sorry. I--

11:55.757 --> 11:57.676
Yeah. Listen, Turner.
I'm kind of in a rush,

11:57.759 --> 11:59.969
but I've got a special assignment for you.
Top priority.

12:00.053 --> 12:00.929
You do?

12:01.012 --> 12:03.098
<i>Yeah, I need you back at that hotel ASAP.</i>

12:03.181 --> 12:05.475
<i>Head of the Olympic Committee
requested you specifically</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:09.312
<i>to guard the hotel suite. Not sure why,
but apparently it's very important</i>

12:09.396 --> 12:11.481
to diplomatic relations or something.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.483
Anyway,
you'll be briefed when you get there.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.531
So? Not fired?

12:19.614 --> 12:20.615
No.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.617
Kind of the opposite, weirdly.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.704
-That's great.
-Yeah, right? Awesome.

12:25.787 --> 12:26.705
Wow. Yes.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.665
-Heck yeah. Solid.
-So... good.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.668
-I-- I should probably go change.
-Yeah.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.045
He said it's serious.
Wants us there right away.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.463
Oh, wow. Okay.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.674
Condogulations.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.135
-Thank you. Thank you very much.
-Yeah, absolutely.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.388
work, play, the same.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.765
-Got it. Thanks.
-Yeah.

12:46.725 --> 12:47.809
All right, Hooch.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.440
<i>Wait. I'm sorry.
You're my assignment?</i>

12:53.523 --> 12:54.858
We're having a playdate.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.068
My daddy called your boss.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.320
Now, you and your dog get to play all day.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.280
Are you sure?

13:00.363 --> 13:03.116
W-W-We could find you
another doggy to play with.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.660
Not like your dog. Tag!

13:08.079 --> 13:10.498
Under standard tag rules, you are now it.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.459
-It's customary to run.
-No--

13:12.542 --> 13:16.171
I thought getting stuck on hotel
security guard duty was bad.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.799
But the chief said
it was an important diplomatic--

13:19.883 --> 13:22.594
Mmm,
I think the word you want is babysitter.

13:22.677 --> 13:26.848
You should've held out for eight bucks
an hour and a pizza at least.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.726
Aw, come on. Don't feel too bad.
We don't have it much better.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.812
Trent and the T-Squad are at city hall,
where all the action is.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.356
No, we had some action earlier.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.566
We told those skateboarders
to get off the stairs.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.651
Mmm... no.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.362
Well, get in there, tiger.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.113
Do some, uh, "diplomacy."

13:42.197 --> 13:43.865
Do you need-- Do you need help?

13:43.948 --> 13:44.824
No. You got it.

13:44.908 --> 13:45.992
-Help.
-I believe in you.

13:46.076 --> 13:46.910
Help.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.331
Come on. Uh, no.

13:51.414 --> 13:55.043
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

13:55.126 --> 13:57.504
Hey, Darius,
are you kidding me with this thing?

13:57.587 --> 14:01.049
Space-age graphite wheels. No!

14:01.132 --> 14:03.635
Boss, two marshals are going inside.

14:03.718 --> 14:06.429
<i>Good. Commence the operation.</i>

14:18.650 --> 14:20.652
Your invitation to the tea party.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.863
Thank you. Thanks for the invite.
Um, but I-I have to work.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.824
You can have a tea party
with Hooch though.

14:25.907 --> 14:27.742
Hi. Can I get the Wi-Fi?

14:28.743 --> 14:31.788
A tea party with two guests
is not a party.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.290
I could drink some tea.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.126
Yeah.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.380
-All right. Great.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.590
Ah...

14:43.466 --> 14:45.468
No one else is sitting on the sofa.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.306
Oh, yeah. Right. Okay.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.226
Great.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.479
Some for you,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.231
some for Hooch...

14:59.691 --> 15:00.942
...and some for me.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.486
Now you drink.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.114
Okay.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.328
Ah.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.496
Good. Very good tea.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.001
Do you get special training for your job?

15:19.044 --> 15:21.004
Yeah. Yeah. There's training.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.214
Well, they should train you to drink tea.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.633
You need to put your pinky in the air.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.094
Oh, um...

15:29.220 --> 15:30.221
Higher.

15:30.847 --> 15:31.973
Higher.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.059
Higher!

15:35.894 --> 15:37.187
Uh.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.319
I don't know a lot about tea.

15:47.030 --> 15:50.408
-Hooch, you're hilarious.
-Come on. That's never coming out.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.578
Well, you're wonderful.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.832
Hey, Laura.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.084
Hey, Scott. Are you busy?

15:59.167 --> 16:00.668
<i>Yeah, well, kind of.</i>

16:00.752 --> 16:02.087
Chief's got me on babysitting duty

16:02.170 --> 16:04.255
with the daughter
of the head of the Olympic Committee.

16:04.339 --> 16:06.091
I've been at a tea party for two hours.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.551
Well, she's probably
just a lonely little kid

16:08.635 --> 16:11.346
<i>who's stuck with diplomats all day.
I mean, can't be that bad.</i>

16:11.429 --> 16:13.682
No, no, no. Bad. Very bad, Laura, okay?

16:13.765 --> 16:16.685
I got tea all over my suit because
she won't let me use all my fingers.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.938
She fed me so many cupcakes I'm dizzy.
I don't eat carbs, Laura.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.648
<i>I'm getting heart palpitations.</i>

16:21.731 --> 16:22.941
That's why you're grumpy.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.859
Hi, Scotty. Hi, Scotty. Hi.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.152
-What?
-I'm sorry.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.279
Someone brought in
a cockatoo for a nail-clipping.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.198
-It's driving me insane.
-Oh.

16:30.281 --> 16:34.035
<i>Hey, I was wondering if you found
out any more information on Dad's files.</i>

16:34.119 --> 16:35.829
Um... Yeah, you know, Laura,

16:35.912 --> 16:38.957
I-I-I-I checked the computer system
at the office before I came,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.709
<i>and there's just no connection.</i>

16:40.792 --> 16:41.960
Hey, Scotty! Scotty!

16:42.043 --> 16:43.086
Shut up!

16:43.169 --> 16:44.462
Ooh!
-What?

16:44.546 --> 16:45.797
-Oh, not you.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.049
<i>Me?</i>
-Not you. Um...

16:48.133 --> 16:50.927
All right. Well,
maybe I should talk to Mom about it.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.138
Oh, please, don't bother Mom with this,

16:53.221 --> 16:55.682
<i>'cause she's gonna bother me,
and I'm gonna bother you.</i>

16:55.765 --> 16:56.891
<i>You see the circle?</i>

16:56.975 --> 16:59.519
-Let's not do the circle of Turner--
Turner!

16:59.602 --> 17:02.188
It does not take that long
to clean a shirt!

17:02.272 --> 17:03.398
Laura, I gotta go.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.859
Yeah. Bye, Scott.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.068
Bye, Scott.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.153
Get your own phone.

17:09.612 --> 17:11.740
And I said to the princess,

17:11.823 --> 17:14.993
-"He's not just a dog. He's a wizard!"

17:15.076 --> 17:17.037
But she didn't believe me.

17:17.120 --> 17:20.457
So I told her she was never allowed
to come to a tea party ever again,

17:20.540 --> 17:22.250
or Hooch would turn her into a frog.

17:23.418 --> 17:24.586
That's great.

17:24.669 --> 17:29.049
Hey, um, I was thinking, um, maybe
we could invite some other kids over,

17:29.132 --> 17:30.925
and they could have my cupcakes, right?

17:31.009 --> 17:34.095
-Like, are there any other kids?
-No. I'm the only one.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.056
Mummy went to live
with the tennis teacher,

17:36.139 --> 17:37.432
because he was a good listener.

17:37.515 --> 17:41.102
I had a nanny, but she quit.
And then the other nannies quit.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.521
And then the nanny company
stopped calling Daddy back.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.732
So now I go everywhere with him.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.609
Oh.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.944
I'm sorry. That m-- That must be hard.

17:51.696 --> 17:54.657
Yes. Sometimes it's lonely.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.659
But Daddy says I have to stay strong

17:56.743 --> 17:59.412
until we can find a nanny
who's not afraid of a challenge.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.416
Now, eat another cupcake.
It's getting cold.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.919
Okay. Great.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.754
Mmm.

18:07.837 --> 18:08.880
Yeah.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.383
Better the eighth time.

18:11.466 --> 18:12.801
-Oh! Oh!

18:12.884 --> 18:14.552
-Okay.
-Hooch is giving you kissy-face!

18:14.636 --> 18:15.845
Okay, Hooch, Hooch.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.264
-Go, Hooch! Come on!
-Hooch, that's enough. All right.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.225
Great. You know what? Come here.

18:20.308 --> 18:24.646
Let's just say the tea party is over
for now, for now.

18:24.729 --> 18:27.190
It was great. You know I had a good time.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.692
All right. Come here.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.443
This needs to stop.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.321
No, he should do it more. It's so funny!

18:34.781 --> 18:36.449
Kissy-face!

18:36.533 --> 18:38.159
No, no. Hooch, no! No!

18:38.243 --> 18:39.744
-Come on!

18:39.828 --> 18:41.705
Oh, come on!

18:41.788 --> 18:44.249
This game's great!
Hooch, no. Hooch.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.918
Keep going, Hooch!
-Hooch, no. Can we just have the tea?

18:47.001 --> 18:48.420
Go, go, go!

18:51.339 --> 18:54.634
So the committee heads over to city hall
in an hour after lunch.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.636
Then we get to guard an empty hotel.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.015
Never know. Skateboarders might come back.

19:00.098 --> 19:02.100
-Yeah, that's all you.

19:02.183 --> 19:03.184
Oh.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.146
Well, well, well, if it isn't the manny.

19:06.229 --> 19:07.731
<i>How's it going up there?</i>

19:08.440 --> 19:11.067
It's awful. She's obsessed
with making Hooch jump on me.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.445
The only break I got was
when I agreed to a pedicure.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.155
It's a nightmare.

19:15.238 --> 19:18.700
Uh, no, a nightmare is when your husband
wants to blow your life savings

19:18.783 --> 19:20.535
<i>on a stroller with graphite wheels.</i>

19:20.618 --> 19:23.872
He's all over me to spend 900 bucks
on a stroller the kid won't even remember.

19:23.955 --> 19:25.081
<i>Hey, you know what?</i>

19:25.165 --> 19:28.418
I was thinking, would you and Xavier
maybe want to come up here for a while?

19:28.501 --> 19:31.171
Maybe, like, take a shift perhaps?
Is that a thing?

19:31.254 --> 19:32.422
<i>Kissy-face!
Uh-uh.</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:34.257
-What--
<i>Oh, no!</i>

19:34.341 --> 19:35.675
-Ooh.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.011
Uh, you know what? Um...

19:38.094 --> 19:41.348
<i>Are you seriously asking for backup
handling a seven-year-old?</i>

19:41.431 --> 19:43.183
-That's pretty bad.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.476
That's not funny.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.644
-Well, it is kinda fu--

19:46.728 --> 19:49.314
Hello? Yo. Scott?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.359
-That's weird.
-Hmm?

19:52.442 --> 19:55.945
Just lost reception. You got any bars?

19:58.740 --> 19:59.741
Nope.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.452
-Both at the same time?
-Hmm.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.579
Think someone's jamming the cell signals?

20:04.662 --> 20:08.458
You know, a couple of those cater waiters
came in with a big case a minute ago,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.877
and it looked a little too heavy
to be food.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.046
Yeah, we should check it out.

20:13.630 --> 20:15.507
Hands in the air.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.052
We are in control now.

20:31.356 --> 20:33.441
Should we do your fingernails now?

20:33.525 --> 20:35.568
Or is it time for more kissy-face?

20:39.531 --> 20:42.325
Actually, Kaya, I think it might not be
a good time for either.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.831
Hey, I got an idea for a new game.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.582
Ow!

20:50.792 --> 20:51.876
I, um...

20:52.627 --> 20:56.965
I have a-a-a-an idea
for a new game on the roof.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.049
On the roof.

20:58.133 --> 20:59.634
A game on the roof?

20:59.718 --> 21:01.553
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the best game ever.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.638
Um, okay, so the first rule is--
Come on, dear.

21:03.722 --> 21:04.723
Come on.

21:04.806 --> 21:07.225
So the first rule is
that we have to get up to the roof

21:07.308 --> 21:11.354
quickly and quietly,
or the, um, the wizards will see us.

21:11.438 --> 21:14.024
The wizards? The wizards are good.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.860
The evil wizards. Let's go. Come on.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.950
You ever see what zip ties do to sea life?
They get dumped in the ocean--

21:24.034 --> 21:25.160
-Shut up!

21:27.787 --> 21:31.541
Welcome, ladies
and gentlemen of the Olympic Committee.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.710
You are now under our control.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.963
Your protectors, the US Marshals,
are at city hall,

21:37.047 --> 21:39.090
where they think an attack is coming.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.800
You may recognize us.

21:40.884 --> 21:43.428
We have been serving you your meals
since you arrived.

21:43.511 --> 21:44.596
Give the phone.

21:44.679 --> 21:46.431
I do hope you enjoyed your breakfast.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.142
Breakfast?
I didn't get any damn breakfast.

21:49.225 --> 21:50.518
It was pretty good.

21:52.604 --> 21:55.774
Sir, what do you want? We--

21:56.691 --> 21:59.277
We are diplomats on a peaceful mission.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.363
Whatever your message,

22:01.446 --> 22:04.532
there are better ways for you
to go about getting it than--

22:10.914 --> 22:16.002
I am sure you have wonderful speech
about friendship between nations.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.754
But let's be honest,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.506
the Olympics is about money,

22:20.632 --> 22:22.008
and so are we.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.969
You will call about ransom shortly,

22:25.053 --> 22:28.598
but first we make sure
that no one is missing.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.185
Uh, we're all here.
Look, there's no need--

22:36.272 --> 22:39.859
Thank you so much for your help,
but I believe you are mistaken.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.445
Andre. Dimitri.

22:42.529 --> 22:45.782
Suite 410. Little girl. Go.

22:45.865 --> 22:49.411
No. Please. Please. No. No. She's-- No!

22:51.746 --> 22:52.747
Good job.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.125
All right.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.211
Okay. So the game is called
"Secret Princess,"

22:58.294 --> 23:03.717
and rules are that the secret princess
has to hide in her magic castle

23:03.800 --> 23:06.594
and-- a-a-and stay very quiet,
or she'll turn into a...

23:09.848 --> 23:12.183
a moose. You understand?

23:12.267 --> 23:14.436
Yes. I mean, yes.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.604
Yeah. Okay.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.148
Did you hear that?

23:19.399 --> 23:22.027
Shh.
We don't want to get turned into mooses.

23:26.865 --> 23:30.910
The other part of the game, right?
Is that I have to go on a quest,

23:30.994 --> 23:36.207
and the secret princess has to hide
in her magic castle with Sir Hooch.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.086
-Something dangerous is happening...

23:40.170 --> 23:41.379
...isn't it?

23:42.464 --> 23:45.050
It's okay. My daddy's a diplomat.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.052
He told me about emergencies.

23:48.678 --> 23:49.679
Yeah.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.058
Yeah, there's some bad men in the hotel,

23:53.141 --> 23:55.143
but I'm gonna stop them, okay?

23:56.102 --> 23:57.645
You must go with him, Sir Hooch...

23:57.729 --> 24:01.149
-...to protect him, to save the kingdom.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.990
Don't come out till I come for you.

24:09.074 --> 24:11.576
A secret princess always stays safe.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.622
Pinkies up.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.667
Shh.

24:20.418 --> 24:21.670
Come on.

24:37.477 --> 24:38.978
How are you still hungry?

24:39.854 --> 24:41.690
No, no, no, you cannot be drooling.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.733
Come here. Come here.

24:45.735 --> 24:47.445
Up here.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.783
Come on. This way. This way.

24:55.328 --> 24:56.329
To the left.

24:56.413 --> 24:58.039
No. This way.

24:58.123 --> 24:59.958
No. No, no, no. I look at blueprint.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.173
Oh, my foot.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.016
"Come up for a tea party.

25:16.099 --> 25:18.435
Eat some cupcakes.
Have a couple of laughs."

25:19.853 --> 25:22.605
She is the Olympic Committee boss's kid.

25:22.689 --> 25:24.733
-Worth more than others.
-Hmm.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.736
This is shortcut to suite
where little girl is.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.907
This is stupid.
Two men to find one little--

25:32.991 --> 25:34.325
Oh!

25:34.409 --> 25:36.411
Idiot.

25:36.494 --> 25:38.788
-Oh, my head. That hurts.
-Get up!

25:38.872 --> 25:42.125
It's my back. I can't move.

25:43.376 --> 25:47.839
I'm going to hurt my back now,
lifting your fat body.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.257
It's not fat.

25:49.341 --> 25:51.676
I have big bones since I was kid.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.430
Not fat? Then why are you too heavy
to lift off the floor?

25:56.848 --> 25:58.058
I'll make it easy for ya.

25:58.141 --> 26:01.478
Face down on the floor.
Hands and feet spread. Now.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.943
-'Sup.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.614
Andre. Dimitri. Come in.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.619
Andre. Dimitri. Come in.

26:18.870 --> 26:21.581
Huh. Now I have a machine gun.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.335
Mikhail,

26:25.418 --> 26:28.338
<i>pull up the security cameras
for the fourth floor.</i>

26:28.421 --> 26:29.422
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

26:40.517 --> 26:42.435
-Hooch.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.146
Hooch. You up for a little fetch?

26:45.230 --> 26:47.273
-You wanna play a little fetch, buddy?

26:51.027 --> 26:53.655
Okay. All right, buddy.
You like eating my socks, right?

26:53.738 --> 26:55.490
-It's a whole shoe. Come on.

26:55.573 --> 26:57.283
-Come on. Ready? Ready?

27:00.370 --> 27:03.540
-Bring it back. Bring it back, Hooch.

27:03.623 --> 27:05.750
-One more, all right? Come on. Go fetch.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.966
Boss, a camera went down.

27:13.675 --> 27:14.718
What? How?

27:14.801 --> 27:17.887
I don't know. I don't see anyone.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.600
Another camera down.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.852
<i>Someone's up there.</i>

27:23.935 --> 27:26.438
<i>If he got to Andre and Dimitri,
he has radios too.</i>

27:27.272 --> 27:30.275
-Sounds like we've got ourselves a cowboy.

27:30.358 --> 27:33.111
A smart move for a fish
that takes a walk on the beach

27:33.194 --> 27:35.822
is to call it off
while he can still reach the ocean.

27:35.905 --> 27:36.906
What?

27:36.990 --> 27:38.575
I'll put it another way.

27:38.658 --> 27:40.660
Know how many hostage situations

27:40.744 --> 27:43.288
in the US end with the bad guys
getting away?

27:43.371 --> 27:44.372
Zero.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.124
Like, since the Bee Gees were number one,

27:46.207 --> 27:48.084
and I don't see anybody
wearing bell-bottoms.

27:48.168 --> 27:50.045
So, you might want to quit
while you're ahead.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.339
Time to hop back in that ocean, fishy.

27:56.593 --> 27:57.761
Will you stop doing that?

27:57.844 --> 28:01.681
Thank you for your advice,
but, um, we are fine.

28:06.811 --> 28:07.812
Come on.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.442
I speak now to the cowboy
on the fourth floor.

28:13.443 --> 28:15.779
<i>We have more men and more guns.</i>

28:16.738 --> 28:18.156
<i>So you should ask yourself,</i>

28:18.239 --> 28:23.078
would you rather be hostage or,
how you say, corpse?

28:23.787 --> 28:26.331
Either way, my men are coming.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.876
Yippee. Kaya's in trouble, Hooch.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.009
Howdy from the US Marshals.

28:38.718 --> 28:39.844
No need to search.

28:40.762 --> 28:41.846
I'll find you.

28:45.308 --> 28:46.393
Alek. Marko.

28:46.476 --> 28:49.396
Go and find him.
And be careful of this man.

28:50.355 --> 28:53.233
There is something dangerous about him.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.111
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:02.283 --> 29:03.910
Hooch. Hooch. Hooch, come back. Come back.

29:06.621 --> 29:09.999
You liked eating my watch.
How'd you like to eat a radio?

29:22.887 --> 29:25.181
I'm trapped on the fourth floor.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.517
If anyone can hear me, I need help.

29:31.312 --> 29:34.983
If anyone can hear me,
I repeat, I need help.

29:37.527 --> 29:38.903
Please. I'm all alone in here.

29:41.698 --> 29:43.783
The storage room on the fourth floor.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.411
I need backup now.

29:48.538 --> 29:49.706
Too late for help.

29:50.457 --> 29:51.916
What?

29:52.000 --> 29:53.001
Ha!

29:55.587 --> 29:56.588
Good boy.

30:06.556 --> 30:09.142
Looks like somebody wants us
to take the stairs, Hooch.

30:10.268 --> 30:12.645
And if we do that,
we're not gonna last long.

30:13.897 --> 30:14.898
Hey, Hooch.

30:15.982 --> 30:17.484
You want some room service?

30:21.780 --> 30:23.406
Marko.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.908
Where are you?

30:26.493 --> 30:27.577
Marko!

30:27.660 --> 30:29.579
<i>Polo. Marko's not coming.</i>

30:29.662 --> 30:31.247
<i>You'll have to settle for me.</i>

30:34.626 --> 30:35.543
What the...

31:12.706 --> 31:14.874
Hooch! Hooch, are you okay?

31:18.211 --> 31:19.295
Forget it.

31:19.379 --> 31:21.881
Enjoy your third lunch.
I'll take care of this guy myself.

31:21.965 --> 31:23.425
It hurts.

31:23.508 --> 31:26.261
Yeah, of course it hurts.
You fell, like, four stories.

31:26.344 --> 31:29.848
Alek. Marko. Report in.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.059
Alek.

31:33.143 --> 31:36.896
Marko. Andre. Dimitri!

31:44.362 --> 31:46.322
See,
this is why we can't have nice things.

31:46.406 --> 31:47.991
Listen, man, just let us go.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.659
Hang it up before it's too late.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.369
It is never too late!

31:51.453 --> 31:53.079
No one can be everywhere at once,

31:53.163 --> 31:58.126
and I believe your friend has soft spot
for one of our guests.

31:58.209 --> 32:00.211
And I think I might know where she is.

32:00.295 --> 32:02.464
Stay here and guard the hostages.
I will go.

32:08.386 --> 32:11.056
You know your boss is blowing it, right?

32:11.139 --> 32:12.891
He's gonna get you caught.

32:12.974 --> 32:14.059
Shut up.

32:14.142 --> 32:16.269
Why should I? We already won.

32:17.020 --> 32:20.482
I'm telling you, that guy upstairs,
he's unstoppable.

32:20.565 --> 32:22.650
He already took out most of your guys.

32:22.734 --> 32:26.905
He's gonna pick off all of you idiots
one by one.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.323
Shut up.

32:28.406 --> 32:29.991
Oh, you're pointing the gun at her.

32:30.075 --> 32:32.077
He's afraid of the pregnant lady
calling him names.

32:32.160 --> 32:34.079
I said, "Shut up"!

32:34.162 --> 32:36.498
-Come over here and make me shut up!
-Yeah?

32:41.503 --> 32:43.546
Hey, hey. There's a knife in his belt.

32:43.630 --> 32:44.756
Come cut us loose.

32:48.093 --> 32:49.302
Yeah.

32:49.386 --> 32:50.387
Over here.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.559
Thank you.

32:56.643 --> 32:57.644
Don't thank us yet.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.148
Here.

33:06.444 --> 33:09.531
By my count,
there's one more guy in the security room.

33:09.614 --> 33:12.117
Yeah, same here.
So if we take care of him, we c--

33:16.287 --> 33:17.580
-Shh.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.833
Stay quiet. We got this.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.301
Don't move!

33:34.597 --> 33:35.598
Nice toes.

33:35.682 --> 33:36.933
Thanks for noticing.

33:37.017 --> 33:39.185
You been busy. Good to see you, cowboy.

33:39.269 --> 33:40.979
-And the horse you rode in on.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.106
Jess, where are the rest of them?

33:43.189 --> 33:45.191
Seems like you took care
of most of them, but--

33:45.275 --> 33:48.737
The boss is looking for Kaya.
We'll take care of the hostages. Go!

33:58.413 --> 33:59.831
Little girl!

34:02.625 --> 34:03.710
Where are you?

34:05.545 --> 34:07.464
You don't have to be afraid.

34:08.006 --> 34:11.176
I am very, very nice man.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.012
Friend of your father.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.264
I am Viktor.

34:16.348 --> 34:17.849
You are safe.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.144
But your father is very worried.

34:21.936 --> 34:22.937
Very worried.

34:30.070 --> 34:33.823
Kaya! Kaya! Kaya, it's me. Are you okay?

34:35.825 --> 34:37.660
He's here! He's here!

34:37.744 --> 34:39.412
Drop your weapon.

34:40.163 --> 34:42.624
-You got up here quick.

34:42.707 --> 34:43.792
Cardio's impeccable.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.211
-Drop it.

34:46.294 --> 34:48.254
All right,
I'm gonna put my weapon down, okay?

34:48.338 --> 34:49.506
Easy, easy.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.636
So, all of this trouble,

34:54.719 --> 34:58.682
all my men taken out by you and that dog?

34:59.516 --> 35:00.517
Be smart, man.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.229
Come on. You and your guys,
you could just walk away.

35:04.312 --> 35:07.065
The hostages are free. It's over.

35:07.857 --> 35:09.192
Oh, I don't think so.

35:12.612 --> 35:13.613
Attention,

35:13.697 --> 35:15.073
<i>everyone who is listening.</i>

35:16.074 --> 35:17.909
<i>I caught your friend.</i>

35:17.992 --> 35:20.662
<i>I was hoping to avoid bloodshed,</i>

35:21.413 --> 35:23.373
<i>but situation has changed.</i>

35:23.456 --> 35:26.626
You have five seconds to surrender
or he dies.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.212
Kaya. Kaya, it's okay. We're just talking.

35:29.295 --> 35:30.505
-It's okay. It's okay.

35:30.588 --> 35:34.259
Hey, listen, you don't have to do this,
right? Come on!

35:34.342 --> 35:36.511
-Five.

35:36.594 --> 35:37.762
[Viktor, on radio] <i>Four.</i>

35:39.556 --> 35:41.599
Three.

35:41.683 --> 35:44.853
Two.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.772
Kissy-face!

35:57.782 --> 35:58.950
Get it off.

35:59.034 --> 36:00.785
Oh, you don't like kissy-face either, huh?

36:00.869 --> 36:03.079
It's-- It's disgusting.

36:03.163 --> 36:05.165
-You're under arrest.

36:08.626 --> 36:10.628
I, uh--
I arrested the individual on the roof

36:10.712 --> 36:13.882
and then rejoined Deputies Baxter
and Wilson downstairs.

36:13.965 --> 36:16.676
Once we found the cell phone jammer,
I was able to contact Deputy Havelock.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.012
Then I came in with the A-Team
and secured the scene.

36:19.095 --> 36:22.098
Honestly, Chief, I'm glad I left Turner
and the dog at the hotel.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.308
This could've been a tragedy.

36:23.391 --> 36:25.643
Just feel bad I wasn't there.

36:31.524 --> 36:33.360
It's okay to feel bad sometimes.

36:33.443 --> 36:34.694
What?

36:36.237 --> 36:39.616
Uh-huh. Well, nice job, all of you.

36:40.533 --> 36:41.826
Thank you.

36:41.910 --> 36:43.912
Sir, can you give us any details?

36:43.995 --> 36:46.164
We're not releasing any information
at this time.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.333
Good job not dying, bro.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.293
Thanks.

36:51.211 --> 36:52.545
Might wanna lose the toenails.

36:55.131 --> 36:56.508
I dunno. I kinda like 'em.

36:56.591 --> 36:59.803
Anyway, I'm gonna check you two later.
I'm gonna go start on that paperwork.

36:59.886 --> 37:00.887
All right.

37:02.347 --> 37:05.266
Looks like Trent's taking
all the credit with the reporters.

37:05.350 --> 37:09.688
Hey, I know it sucks,
but don't be too hard on the chief.

37:09.771 --> 37:11.106
I mean, what are they gonna say?

37:11.189 --> 37:13.983
They got lucky and a junior deputy
and his dog were babysitting

37:14.067 --> 37:15.777
-when it all went down?
-Yeah.

37:15.860 --> 37:17.070
Excuse me!

37:18.029 --> 37:19.906
Oh, hey! Are you all right?

37:19.989 --> 37:22.742
Yes. I'm leaving now with my dad,

37:22.826 --> 37:24.661
but I wanted to say goodbye.

37:31.501 --> 37:32.919
Thank you, Sir Hooch.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.381
Can you kneel down?

37:40.135 --> 37:43.221
I knight you, Sir Scott of House Hooch,

37:43.304 --> 37:45.348
protector of the secret princess.

37:46.474 --> 37:47.475
You may rise.

37:49.227 --> 37:53.565
Thank you for saving me
and for the funnest day of my life.

37:53.648 --> 37:55.233
Thanks for the playdate.

37:56.026 --> 37:58.069
Stay safe, secret princess.

37:58.153 --> 37:59.154
I will.

38:03.992 --> 38:04.993
Thank you.

38:05.618 --> 38:08.747
Aw... Look who's good with kids!

38:08.830 --> 38:12.042
I'm gonna expect your babysitting services
when my little one arrives.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.626
Can't afford me.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.837
Oh, really? We'll see about that.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.131
All right, you ready to roll?

38:18.214 --> 38:20.842
We got a mountain of after-action reports
to get to.

38:20.925 --> 38:22.761
Yeah, let's do it.

38:26.639 --> 38:28.641
-[Darius, on phone] <i>Hey, babe.</i>
Hey, baby.

38:28.725 --> 38:30.310
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

38:30.393 --> 38:32.270
<i>Are you still mad at me
about the stroller?</i>

38:32.354 --> 38:35.899
Hey, so, I thought about it.

38:36.608 --> 38:39.361
Let's get the stroller
if it makes you happy.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.445
<i>Really?</i>

38:40.528 --> 38:44.115
Our baby's gonna glide on graphite wheels.

38:46.117 --> 38:49.287
All right, I gotta go. Love you.

38:50.872 --> 38:53.124
I guess you were right
about the playing thing.

38:53.208 --> 38:57.462
And I'm pretty sure Hooch saved my life
with the most disgusting game ever.

38:57.545 --> 39:01.174
Yeah, like I said, lots of potential.

39:02.008 --> 39:03.593
Yeah, about that, um...

39:03.677 --> 39:06.304
You know, I'm still not exactly sure on
how to train him.

39:06.388 --> 39:09.307
He seems really good
at learning to do things I don't like.

39:09.391 --> 39:12.310
-Right. Well, maybe you have to play more.
-Yeah.

39:12.394 --> 39:14.145
-Play, like how?
-I don't know.

39:14.229 --> 39:15.772
What do you like to do for fun?

39:15.855 --> 39:17.107
Um...

39:17.190 --> 39:18.400
using the Swiffer's fun.

39:18.483 --> 39:19.901
It's really fun.

39:19.984 --> 39:22.278
Uh, criminal justice podcasts.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.363
It's a good time.

39:23.446 --> 39:24.906
Uh, I jog.

39:24.989 --> 39:28.410
-Jogging. Jogging, yes! Jogging's fun.
-Yeah.

39:28.493 --> 39:30.578
I would know. I jog.

39:31.162 --> 39:34.416
Yeah. We could jog together
with Hooch and Angel.

39:34.499 --> 39:35.792
Yeah.

39:35.875 --> 39:36.876
Um...

39:37.585 --> 39:39.504
-How about Thursday?
-Yes!

39:39.587 --> 39:40.964
-Okay.
-It's a date!

39:41.047 --> 39:42.757
On the calendar called "Thursday."

39:42.841 --> 39:44.968
-And I'll see you on that calendar date.

39:45.051 --> 39:47.971
-Whoa! That was loud. Someone's barking.
-Yeah.

39:48.054 --> 39:50.265
It's my job to take care of it,
so I will. Bye!

39:50.348 --> 39:51.349
Bye.

39:51.975 --> 39:52.976
Coming!

39:57.439 --> 39:58.440
Hey, look!

39:58.523 --> 40:01.151
Aw, it's Dad's favorite sweater.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.153
Do we keep it, or...

40:03.236 --> 40:06.239
Oh, it feels wrong to get rid of it,
but what good's it gon--

40:06.322 --> 40:09.325
-Hey. Seems like somebody wants it.
-Hooch, that's rude.

40:09.409 --> 40:11.161
Tuppy would never do that. Right, Tuppy?

40:13.705 --> 40:15.457
You know, it was 30 years ago.

40:15.540 --> 40:18.376
I was riding around in a police car
with Scott and the first Hooch.

40:18.460 --> 40:19.377
Mmm.

40:20.086 --> 40:21.838
And I swear, they are just the same.

40:23.423 --> 40:25.800
Thanks for helping us pack up his stuff,
David.

40:25.884 --> 40:27.552
He-- He'd love that you're here.

40:27.635 --> 40:29.471
No place I'd rather be.

40:30.263 --> 40:32.265
Made sure
the Olympic Committee was safe

40:32.349 --> 40:35.060
and the San Francisco PD
took away the bad guys.

40:35.143 --> 40:39.105
Were you ever afraid that Hooch
wasn't gonna be able to catch all of them?

40:39.189 --> 40:41.316
Well, I mean, Hooch didn't do everything.

40:41.399 --> 40:42.984
But he did the main thing.

40:43.068 --> 40:45.695
I don't know about that.
I mean, when you say the main thing.

40:45.779 --> 40:48.948
He saved you by jumping on the boss
of the bad guys,

40:49.032 --> 40:50.784
-so that's a main thing.
-Some help.

40:50.867 --> 40:52.535
You're right. Hooch is great.

40:52.619 --> 40:54.996
Your grandpa thought
Hooch was a pretty special dog.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.083
It sounds like he was right
regardless of what your uncle says.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.544
What, are you taking his side?
He's literally slobbering on your carpet.

41:01.628 --> 41:04.422
-Isn't that what carpets are for?

41:04.506 --> 41:07.342
Can you help me and Uncle David
take these boxes down to the basement?

41:07.425 --> 41:08.259
Yeah, sure.

41:08.343 --> 41:11.262
And I will show you pictures
of the day we got Hooch.

41:11.346 --> 41:12.180
Yes!

41:12.263 --> 41:13.598
-Yes!
-Yes!

41:14.349 --> 41:16.059
-Okay, good to see you.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.478
Hey, Scott.
Since they're busy, I was thinking.

41:18.561 --> 41:20.563
Remember when Dad was on a case
when we were little,

41:20.647 --> 41:22.857
sometimes he would take us on a looky-loo?

41:22.941 --> 41:23.858
A look-see.

41:23.942 --> 41:25.485
-Yes, that!
-Yeah.

41:25.568 --> 41:28.530
I just wanna go on one last look-see...
for Dad.

41:28.613 --> 41:29.739
Come on.

41:30.657 --> 41:32.075
Let's go. Grab Hooch!

41:32.158 --> 41:33.827
I-- I didn't say yes.

41:34.452 --> 41:35.787
Did I say yes?

41:48.133 --> 41:49.134
All right...

41:49.968 --> 41:51.720
You ready to tell me
what we're doing here?

41:51.803 --> 41:54.931
You know,
I've been thinking more about Dad's case.

41:55.015 --> 41:57.475
I'm not even sure
we should call it a case.

41:57.559 --> 41:59.394
I mean, it's just a bunch of files.

41:59.477 --> 42:02.313
You do not actually believe that.
I mean, it has to be more!

42:02.397 --> 42:04.733
No, it doesn't have to be anything.

42:04.816 --> 42:06.026
Where even are we anyway?

42:06.109 --> 42:07.402
Valley Road.

42:07.485 --> 42:09.404
Where they found Dad
after the heart attack.

42:09.487 --> 42:11.114
Why? It's just a random road.

42:11.197 --> 42:12.198
Exactly!

42:12.282 --> 42:14.701
I mean, haven't you ever wondered
why was he here?

42:14.784 --> 42:16.494
Yeah, he was probably on some, like,

42:16.578 --> 42:18.788
hot pursuit looking for a lost cat
or something.

42:18.872 --> 42:20.331
Okay, well, we're here, okay?

42:20.415 --> 42:24.377
It's a look-see,
so we need to get out and look...

42:24.461 --> 42:26.755
-...and see.

42:26.838 --> 42:29.466
-We can see from here.
-No, that's--

42:29.549 --> 42:31.468
-There's nothing to see.
-No, that's a look-sit.

42:31.551 --> 42:32.635
That doesn't make any sense.

42:32.719 --> 42:36.264
We have to get out, you know, and, like--
and feel the vibes.

42:36.348 --> 42:39.642
The vibes are--
Vibes are not a thing, Laura. They're not.

42:39.726 --> 42:41.311
Not until you feel them.

42:49.611 --> 42:52.447
Can't believe
Dad spent his last moments here.

42:54.866 --> 42:56.034
At least it's pretty.

42:56.785 --> 42:57.786
Yeah, that's true.

42:57.869 --> 43:00.663
He could've been stuck in traffic
on Highway 116 or something.

43:01.998 --> 43:05.085
Hey. This is hard for me too.

43:05.710 --> 43:06.711
Yeah.

43:06.795 --> 43:10.757
But-- But we can't make this a thing
just 'cause we don't wanna let Dad go.

43:10.840 --> 43:12.258
Yeah, I know you're right. Yeah.

43:12.342 --> 43:13.968
Hey, Hooch. Cut it out.

43:14.052 --> 43:15.720
Hooch, cut it out.

43:15.804 --> 43:17.305
Let him sniff. What's the harm?

43:17.389 --> 43:21.184
Well, ruining my shoes for one thing.
You try bringing home a muddy dog!

43:21.267 --> 43:22.811
I bring home a muddy kid!

43:22.894 --> 43:24.562
What do you got? Come here.

43:28.400 --> 43:30.235
What is this? Ugh.

43:33.405 --> 43:34.406
What is it?

43:36.783 --> 43:38.368
I think it's Dad's old watch.

43:43.748 --> 43:44.749
Oh, my gosh.

43:46.334 --> 43:49.087
Scott, the band is snapped off.

43:49.921 --> 43:53.466
-What if something happened here?
-Let's-- Let's not jump to conclusions.

43:53.550 --> 43:55.093
Who's jumping? I'm not jumping.

43:55.176 --> 43:59.014
What? You think Dad just yanked
his watch off and threw it into the woods?

44:01.516 --> 44:02.934
Hooch is getting vibes.

44:05.353 --> 44:08.106
Admit it, you're getting them too.
Bad vibes.

44:11.693 --> 44:13.028
Yeah, maybe I am.
