[grunting]

00:23.166 --> 00:24.668
[Chatter] Bawk! Run for your lives!

[growling]

00:52.320 --> 00:53.446
[Wheeler] Get ready, Brag.

00:53.529 --> 00:56.783
Only about 15 minutes to San Francisco.

00:56.866 --> 00:59.243
[chuckles] And our ten million.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.330
Thanks to that little black market baby.
[laughing]

01:02.413 --> 01:04.540
I still can't believe we found a collector

01:04.623 --> 01:07.001
willing to pay that much
for a stinkin' ape.

01:07.085 --> 01:12.048
Come on, Wheeler, we might have bagged
the last wild ape on Earth!

01:12.131 --> 01:13.257

- [squeals]
- [metal clangs]

01:17.386 --> 01:19.263
Hey! How the heck did he get out?

01:19.347 --> 01:21.891
[Wheeler] Who cares?
Just get him back in the cage!

01:22.892 --> 01:24.310
[chitters]

01:24.393 --> 01:26.520
Stand still, you miserable little...

01:26.604 --> 01:27.814
[Brag grunts]

01:27.897 --> 01:29.232
Gotcha!

01:29.315 --> 01:30.316
- [hoots]
- [grunts]

01:31.150 --> 01:32.151
[grunts]

01:32.235 --> 01:34.738
Get off me, Brag, or we'll crash!

01:34.821 --> 01:36.530
[laughing] Uh-oh!

01:37.531 --> 01:39.492
- [alarm buzzing]
- [grunts]

01:42.078 --> 01:43.579
Hold on!

01:43.662 --> 01:45.039
[whimpers]

01:45.123 --> 01:47.208
- [men screaming]
- [helicopter crashing]

01:49.794 --> 01:51.838
[gasps] Don't move, Wheeler.

01:53.464 --> 01:55.591
Don't even breathe.

01:57.761 --> 02:00.513
- Oh, no!
- We gotta get outta here!

02:00.596 --> 02:04.517
- [chitters happily]
- Yeah, 'cause our ten mil is getting away!

02:10.523 --> 02:11.524
[gasps]

02:13.526 --> 02:15.444
Ahhh! [groaning]

02:16.445 --> 02:18.281
- [Wheeler yelling]
- [both grunt]

02:19.573 --> 02:22.243
No way we're letting
all that money escape!

02:23.244 --> 02:25.288
[Richard] Dad, did you hear that crash?

02:25.371 --> 02:27.415
Must have been the chopper
that just flew over.

02:27.498 --> 02:29.000
[Leo] I just spoke to 911.

02:29.083 --> 02:33.171
They're dispatching rescue workers,
but it will take time to get up here.

02:33.254 --> 02:37.716
We need to try and locate that crash
and see if there are any survivors.

02:37.801 --> 02:40.178
I'm sure the sound came
from this direction.

02:40.261 --> 02:43.848
You know these woods better than
anyone, so, lead the way, Lukas.

02:43.932 --> 02:45.934
[hooting]

02:50.646 --> 02:53.107
- [gun firing]
- [Brag] Gah! Missed!

02:53.191 --> 02:54.442
I'll nail the little...

02:56.820 --> 02:58.446
[Lukas] That sounded like a gunshot.

02:58.529 --> 03:01.240
I bet the pilot fired a rescue flare.

03:01.324 --> 03:04.035
Or maybe poachers are hunting
the Redwoods again!

03:04.118 --> 03:07.663
Either way, let's keep a sharp eye
and stick close.

03:08.456 --> 03:10.624
Don't worry, Dad, I know what I'm doing.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.336
Ugh! Oh, gross!

03:13.419 --> 03:16.089
- I just stepped in...
- [sniffing] Deer dung!

03:16.172 --> 03:18.007
[laughing] Oh, this is great!

03:18.091 --> 03:20.426
Thanks a lot, Lukas.

03:20.509 --> 03:23.387
No, I meant,
I haven't seen any for so long,

03:23.471 --> 03:25.556
I was afraid there might not be
any deer left!

03:25.639 --> 03:28.184
Between habitat destruction and poachers,

03:28.267 --> 03:29.560
in another ten or so years,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.105
I fear there won't be
any wild animals left.

03:32.188 --> 03:33.647
[panting]

03:33.731 --> 03:35.191
[guns firing]

03:38.277 --> 03:40.654
Too bad bugs aren't extinct.

03:40.738 --> 03:42.031
I hate them so much,

03:42.115 --> 03:45.576
I'm going to invent a gigantic
bionic insect-eating spider.

03:45.659 --> 03:49.205
Hello!
Spiders already eat insects, Richard.

03:49.288 --> 03:51.249
Nature takes care of itself.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.501
We don't need Richard's useless bionics.

03:53.584 --> 03:57.005
[gasps] I can't believe
you just dissed our dad!

03:57.088 --> 03:59.590
- I didn't.
- Yeah, he did!

03:59.673 --> 04:03.094
Dad's the most important bionics scientist
in the whole world.

04:04.428 --> 04:06.139
You know I didn't mean it like that!

04:06.848 --> 04:08.807
I understand how you feel, Lukas.

04:08.892 --> 04:10.268
I love nature, too.

04:10.351 --> 04:13.812
That's why I got into bionics,
to help people and injured animals.

04:13.897 --> 04:15.231
[distant gun firing]

04:17.274 --> 04:18.526
Lukas!

04:19.192 --> 04:20.778
[panting]

04:27.035 --> 04:29.078
- [guns cocking]
- [Kong gasps]

04:29.828 --> 04:31.039
[darts thudding]

04:31.122 --> 04:32.123
Ahhh!

04:34.167 --> 04:35.793
[Wheeler] We got him now!

04:35.877 --> 04:38.671
[Brag chuckles] No way out.

04:38.754 --> 04:40.756
- [whimpers]
- [gun beeps]

04:42.008 --> 04:43.592
[Brag groans] Out of tranq darts!

04:43.676 --> 04:45.594
- [Lukas] Psst.
- [exclaims]

04:45.678 --> 04:46.930
[Lukas] Come with me.

04:47.013 --> 04:50.391
[whispers] Hurry, this way.
I want to help you.

04:50.474 --> 04:51.976
Trust me.

04:59.150 --> 05:00.484
I'm your friend.

05:02.820 --> 05:06.324
[Brag] Hey! What the...
[Wheeler] Where'd that rotten ape go now?

05:07.200 --> 05:08.952
- Come on!
- There!

05:13.247 --> 05:14.707
[gun firing]

05:16.918 --> 05:19.045
- Cops!
- [helicopter whirring]

05:19.128 --> 05:20.379
[siren wailing]

05:20.463 --> 05:21.797
[Brag] We gotta get outta here!

05:23.174 --> 05:26.928
Okay, but I swear, one day,
I'll find that filthy brat

05:27.011 --> 05:30.348
that just cost us $10 million!

05:31.015 --> 05:32.350
[Leo] Your brother was right.

05:32.433 --> 05:36.270
The police said the helicopter they found
was definitely used by poachers.

05:36.354 --> 05:37.605
You think they got Lukas?

05:37.688 --> 05:39.565
- Maybe they'll hold him for...
- He's fine.

05:39.648 --> 05:42.776
Lukas sent a holo-text
saying he has a surprise for us.

05:42.860 --> 05:44.903
[Lukas whispers] I just had to wait
for the police to leave.

05:48.491 --> 05:50.368
Why? What are you hiding?

05:50.451 --> 05:52.786
Shh! Be quiet, you'll scare the baby.

05:52.870 --> 05:54.247
[both] Baby?

05:54.330 --> 05:55.873
[chittering]

05:56.749 --> 05:59.668
The poachers were shooting at him,
so I had to help.

05:59.752 --> 06:02.546
This is my dad, Dr. Leo Remy.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.215
And my brother, Richard.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.675
- [whimpers]
- It's okay.

06:06.759 --> 06:10.096
I swear, I'm never gonna let
anyone hurt you again.

06:10.929 --> 06:13.766
- [squeals]
- Lukas, you shouldn't lie!

06:13.849 --> 06:15.434
Even to a dumb monkey.

06:15.518 --> 06:17.103
Not a monkey, Richard.

06:18.104 --> 06:20.939
I'm certain that this is a baby gorilla,

06:21.024 --> 06:23.734
which were believed to be
extinct in the wild!

06:23.817 --> 06:25.903
Okay, fine. A dumb ape.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.613
But Lukas still lied.

06:27.696 --> 06:29.073
You can't protect it.

06:29.157 --> 06:33.077
We have to turn it over to the police
or a zoo or someplace...

06:33.161 --> 06:36.330
No! Dad, we have to keep him!

06:36.414 --> 06:40.209
If we don't, he could end up spending
his entire life locked in a cage!

06:40.293 --> 06:42.211
Or worse, in some lab!

06:42.295 --> 06:46.632
Now, I appreciate what you're saying, son,
but while he's cute and little now,

06:46.715 --> 06:48.926
once he becomes a full-grown gorilla...

06:49.009 --> 06:52.971
[Richard] Apes in the wild could grow
up to 5'11" and weigh over 500 pounds?

06:53.056 --> 06:55.015
[scoffs] Forget that!

06:55.099 --> 06:58.602
Anyway, if Mom were here,
she'd never let you keep it.

06:58.686 --> 07:01.939
Yeah, well, Mom moved back east with her
new husband, so why don't you just...

07:02.022 --> 07:05.568
- Now, that's not the point.
- Right! Dad...

07:05.651 --> 07:08.571
You've always told us
that it's every human's responsibility

07:08.654 --> 07:10.864
to do everything they can
to protect wildlife.

07:10.948 --> 07:14.285
So, this is our chance
to do the right thing!

07:16.287 --> 07:18.206
Please, Dad...

07:19.207 --> 07:20.958
[sighs] Very well.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.794
We can see how he does
back home in the city.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.546
But, it's just a test.

07:25.629 --> 07:27.090
No promises.

07:27.173 --> 07:30.968
And you boys will be responsible
for taking care of your...

07:31.052 --> 07:32.095
your pet.

07:32.178 --> 07:33.971
Nuh-uh! Not me.

07:34.055 --> 07:36.515
I didn't ask to live with a smelly ape.

07:36.599 --> 07:39.310
I'll do it!
I'll take care of everything he needs.

07:39.393 --> 07:40.603
I swear, Dad!

07:40.686 --> 07:43.147
[chuckling]
All right, we'll give it a try.

07:43.231 --> 07:45.023
Now let's start packing up.

07:45.108 --> 07:46.984
Hey, hey, you need a name.

07:47.068 --> 07:50.488
[chittering] Kong! Kong! Kong!

07:50.571 --> 07:52.323
[laughs] That's it, then.

07:52.406 --> 07:53.991
You are Kong!

07:57.203 --> 07:59.372
[Lukas] Hey, Dad, are you going
to the lab today?

07:59.455 --> 08:01.332
I wanna show Kong your island.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.544
[Leo] Now, let's just see
how baby Kong adapts first.

08:05.628 --> 08:08.922
Oh, he'll be great! No prob.
[softly] Oh, come on.

08:09.006 --> 08:10.216
Fit right in.

08:10.299 --> 08:13.844
Until Anita sees his ugly face
and freaks out.

08:14.637 --> 08:16.597
[whirring]

08:20.476 --> 08:22.770
You are late, Dr. Remy!

08:22.853 --> 08:25.022
But I made your favorite cookies, anyway.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.024
[Chatter] Bawk! Favorite cookies!

08:27.816 --> 08:31.862
Thank you, Anita,
but I need to warn you that...

08:31.945 --> 08:33.739
we have a little surprise.

08:33.822 --> 08:35.408
[Kong chitters]

08:37.118 --> 08:39.120
[exclaiming in Spanish]

08:39.203 --> 08:41.455
[Chatter squawking in Spanish]

08:41.539 --> 08:43.999
Let's get 'em, Kong! [laughing]

08:44.082 --> 08:46.710
It's all right, Anita, it's not a monster.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.463
It's, uh, just a baby gorilla.

08:49.547 --> 08:53.717
Oh, yeah, Anita's gonna quit
for sure if the ape isn't history.

08:53.801 --> 08:54.885
[Lukas] Wow, Anita!

08:54.968 --> 08:57.305
Baby Kong totally loves your cookies.

08:57.388 --> 08:58.847
[chitters happily]

09:01.099 --> 09:02.851
[laughing] Well...

09:02.935 --> 09:05.604
At least <i>el pequeño</i> has good taste.

09:05.688 --> 09:07.440
[chittering]

09:07.523 --> 09:09.983
Oh, what a good <i>niño!</i>

09:10.067 --> 09:12.069
You can have the last cookie!

09:12.153 --> 09:15.614
[Chatter] Bawk! No fair! Bawk! No fair!

09:15.698 --> 09:18.367
Aw, man, I can't believe this.

09:18.451 --> 09:21.454
[chuckling] Well, I'm very happy to see

09:21.537 --> 09:23.747
Chatter's new bionic wing
is working so well.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.583
First bionic bird! Bawk!

09:25.666 --> 09:27.376
First bionic bird! Bawk!

09:27.460 --> 09:29.420
[speaking Spanish]

09:29.503 --> 09:32.089
I am very glad you were able
to save his life,

09:32.173 --> 09:35.092
but did you have to save
his voice as well, Dr. Remy?

09:35.176 --> 09:37.553
- He's such an annoying chatter box!
- [Chatter] Bawk!

09:37.636 --> 09:39.222
One hurdle down.

09:39.305 --> 09:41.474
Kong seems to have won Anita over.

09:41.557 --> 09:45.186
Now let's see how the little fellow
does inside our houseboat.

09:46.144 --> 09:48.606
[Lukas] Hey, Kong, want to come
toss the ball with us?

09:48.689 --> 09:50.816
- [Kong chitters]
- Do you know how to throw a ball?

09:50.899 --> 09:51.984
Like this.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.819
- [grunts]
- Throw it back!

09:53.902 --> 09:55.779
No! That's my ball!

09:55.863 --> 09:57.406
Throw it! Don't eat it!

09:57.490 --> 09:59.032
[laughs] Like this.

09:59.116 --> 10:00.826
Like this.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.163
[both grunt]

10:06.207 --> 10:08.751
Whoa! That's some arm!

10:08.834 --> 10:10.336
Happy you're on my team.

10:12.588 --> 10:14.131
[Lukas laughs]

10:17.134 --> 10:19.052
Catch me if you can!

10:22.598 --> 10:24.141
[laughing]

10:24.725 --> 10:25.976
[Kong chitters]

10:27.895 --> 10:29.897
Hey! I'm trying to study here!

10:32.733 --> 10:35.861
[Lukas laughing] Come on, Kong! Over here!

10:42.785 --> 10:44.202
[hooting]

10:47.790 --> 10:49.417
[wood smashing]

10:51.419 --> 10:53.211
- [both] Uh-oh!
- [Anita speaking Spanish]

10:53.296 --> 10:55.088
[Leo] What happened? I...

10:55.172 --> 10:57.841
Kong grew... again!

10:57.925 --> 11:00.386
Stop that! Awk! Big ape! Bawk!

11:00.469 --> 11:06.016
[Leo] Kong is already as large and heavy
as any gorilla in recorded history.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.519
And he's still technically just a baby.

11:08.602 --> 11:10.521
And way stronger, too.

11:10.604 --> 11:12.440
Dad, you should see his fastball.

11:12.523 --> 11:14.274
Kong could pitch the World Series!

11:14.358 --> 11:16.360
Check out what he did to my mitt!

11:21.281 --> 11:23.075
- [smashing]
- [grunts]

11:24.327 --> 11:26.370
- [gasps]
- [rumbling]

11:28.622 --> 11:30.708
Everyone, outside! Now!

11:30.791 --> 11:33.711
- We need to get onto the dock!
- [Lukas] Is it an earthquake?

11:33.794 --> 11:36.464
No, it's your overgrown ape!

11:36.547 --> 11:37.923
[chitters nervously]

11:38.006 --> 11:40.133
[Chatter] Bawk! Run for your lives!

11:45.848 --> 11:48.892
- [crowd murmuring]
- [man] What is that thing? It's huge!

11:48.976 --> 11:51.812
I can't believe Kong wrecked our house.

11:51.895 --> 11:53.564
He grew right through it!

11:53.647 --> 11:55.691
Everything's gone!

11:55.774 --> 11:57.234
[grunts]

11:57.317 --> 11:59.945
[sighs] I'm just grateful no one was hurt.

12:00.028 --> 12:02.906
Don't worry, everything will be okay.

12:02.990 --> 12:03.991
Wanna bet?

12:04.074 --> 12:05.659
[sirens wailing]

12:08.871 --> 12:11.707
Uh-oh! Big ape! Bawk! Big trouble!

12:12.708 --> 12:13.959
Don't shoot!

12:14.042 --> 12:15.335
I'm Dr. Leo Remy.

12:15.419 --> 12:18.005
I assure you, this animal is harmless.

12:18.088 --> 12:22.134
Hold your fire, but keep
your weapons trained on that...

12:22.217 --> 12:23.761
giant gorilla?

12:25.095 --> 12:26.639
[sirens wailing]

12:27.556 --> 12:28.974
[roaring]

12:30.768 --> 12:33.228
Kong really blew it this time!

12:33.311 --> 12:36.940
The police are gonna put him away,
or maybe even destroy him for this!

12:37.024 --> 12:38.942
Nobody's gonna hurt my bro.

12:39.026 --> 12:41.529
Kong! Kong, listen to me!

12:41.612 --> 12:43.030
Hold your fire!

12:43.864 --> 12:46.199
It's okay, Kong,
you know you can trust me.

12:51.705 --> 12:52.831
Whoa!

12:52.915 --> 12:55.250
[laughs] Nice move, Kong.

12:55.333 --> 12:59.171
You see, Captain,
he's completely tame and quite gentle.

12:59.254 --> 13:02.758
[stammers] Kong really is a good boy.

13:02.841 --> 13:03.926
Well, maybe...

13:04.009 --> 13:07.596
but I still can't let this giant
home-wrecker run around free.

13:07.680 --> 13:09.640
He must be contained and controlled

13:09.723 --> 13:12.518
until a judge can decide
what should be done with him.

13:12.601 --> 13:14.019
Done with him?

13:14.853 --> 13:16.439
We gotta get outta here.

13:16.522 --> 13:19.608
I'm telling Dad, I'm taking you home.

13:21.694 --> 13:23.487
[whispers] Get ready, Kong. Now, go!

13:25.280 --> 13:27.032
[sirens wailing]

13:27.115 --> 13:29.452
[crowd shrieking]

13:31.161 --> 13:32.538
[officers clamoring]

13:32.621 --> 13:33.997
Why don't they start shooting?

13:34.081 --> 13:36.291
They can't risk hitting your brother.

13:36.374 --> 13:37.668
Dr. Remy?

13:37.751 --> 13:41.046
You are Dr. Leo Remy,
the famous scientist?

13:41.129 --> 13:42.756
He's my dad.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.842
Tell me, Doctor, is that creature

13:44.925 --> 13:48.178
some super-sized bionic experiment
of yours?

13:48.261 --> 13:51.056
I can assure you that Kong
is flesh and blood

13:51.139 --> 13:53.809
and poses no threat to anyone.

13:53.892 --> 13:58.564
I will stake my reputation on it
and I take full responsibility for him.

13:58.647 --> 14:00.899
And where are the boy
and the monster-ape going?

14:00.983 --> 14:04.695
Somewhere that Kong will be
no danger to society.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.614
<i>Or it to him.</i>

14:08.115 --> 14:12.119
Dr. Remy, what will we do now?
Where will we all live?

14:12.202 --> 14:15.956
Yeah, now that Kong totally trashed
our houseboat.

14:16.039 --> 14:17.791
[Chatter] Bawk! We're sunk!

14:17.875 --> 14:19.042
Before this happened,

14:19.126 --> 14:22.045
I'd already been thinking about
how we'd be able to keep Kong.

14:22.129 --> 14:25.007
So, I bought a place for us
in the Redwoods.

14:25.090 --> 14:29.136
What? But that's not fair!
I don't wanna leave the city!

14:29.219 --> 14:30.638
I hate the forest.

14:30.721 --> 14:32.222
And what about school?

14:32.305 --> 14:36.059
Ugh, you're home-schooled,
Richard, nothing changes there.

14:36.143 --> 14:39.522
Look, son, I'm sure you'll feel
differently when you see it.

14:47.154 --> 14:48.739
[Lukas] Hey, watch it!
[Richard] What's the big idea?

14:48.822 --> 14:53.285
[Lukas laughs] The paint's supposed
to go on the house, not on us!

14:53.368 --> 14:56.705
I made lemonade for my hard-working
<i>muchachos!</i>

14:58.707 --> 14:59.917
[Kong grunts]

15:00.000 --> 15:02.377
[Leo] For you, too, Kong.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.171
[chittering]

15:09.009 --> 15:10.385
[belching loudly]

15:13.346 --> 15:15.516
[Chatter] Bawk! Excuse you!

15:15.599 --> 15:18.310
Well, at least now we don't have to
worry about his belching

15:18.393 --> 15:21.063
waking the neighbors anymore.

15:21.146 --> 15:24.357
I still don't think it's fair
that Kong destroys our home,

15:24.441 --> 15:25.609
I lose all my stuff,

15:25.693 --> 15:28.403
and you move me to this bug-filled forest

15:28.486 --> 15:30.823
just so we can keep him!

15:30.906 --> 15:33.158
But, Richard, it wasn't just for Kong.

15:33.241 --> 15:36.453
I've always wanted room
for a state-of-the-art lab at home...

15:36.537 --> 15:42.042
where you will be able to begin that
robotic dinosaur you've always dreamed of.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.252
Seriously?

15:44.336 --> 15:45.879
Let's check it out!

15:50.258 --> 15:52.720
It's amazing!

15:52.803 --> 15:56.306
[Lukas] I can't wait to see
your first robotic dinosaur.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.811
[Leo] But, Richard, you can only work
on your project when I am present,

16:00.894 --> 16:05.107
and even then, you must never
touch any of the lasers.

16:05.190 --> 16:09.527
Now, I need your word of honor
that you will never go into the lab alone.

16:09.612 --> 16:10.696
I swear!

16:10.779 --> 16:12.740
[chittering]

16:12.823 --> 16:16.284
No, Kong! You are not allowed in here!

16:16.368 --> 16:17.995
[whimpers]

16:18.078 --> 16:20.664
There's just too many
delicate instruments,

16:20.748 --> 16:22.666
and extremely dangerous lasers.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.170
Now, Lukas, I want your word, too,

16:27.254 --> 16:30.507
that you will make certain
Kong never goes into the lab,

16:30.591 --> 16:32.217
no matter what.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.719
You don't have to worry, Dad.

16:33.802 --> 16:36.680
The last thing Kong and I want
is to be indoors

16:36.764 --> 16:38.807
when there's so much exploring
to do outside!

16:38.891 --> 16:39.933
[Kong grunts]

16:40.017 --> 16:41.351
[flies buzzing]

16:41.434 --> 16:43.353
[Lukas] We'll see you later!

16:43.436 --> 16:44.688
[whispers] Come on, bro.

16:44.772 --> 16:46.940
Time to start building
our top-secret fort.

16:47.024 --> 16:50.235
No one, not even Dad, can know about it.

16:50.318 --> 16:52.821
It's gonna be our own special hideout!

16:52.905 --> 16:54.657
Finger five on it, bro!

16:54.740 --> 16:55.991
[both laugh]

16:57.325 --> 16:58.576
You know, Kong,

16:58.661 --> 17:01.538
the California redwoods
are the tallest trees on Earth.

17:02.873 --> 17:06.001
[chuckling]
Luckily, they're even taller than you.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.102
[tightening]

17:25.353 --> 17:26.814
[whirring]

17:34.905 --> 17:38.075
That's what I call a real "king-size" bed.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.284
[chitters]

17:40.618 --> 17:43.997
And now I don't need to always take
the Kong-vator to get up here.

17:46.416 --> 17:48.210
[sighs] Wow!

17:48.293 --> 17:50.545
It's so cool being up so high!

17:50.628 --> 17:52.380
[chittering]

17:54.341 --> 17:55.467
[Lukas laughs]

17:55.550 --> 17:57.344
[laughing] Whoa!

18:01.139 --> 18:02.224
What a view!

18:02.307 --> 18:04.768
Our secret hideout is awesome!

18:04.852 --> 18:08.355
But I promise, one day,
when I'm old enough to afford it,

18:08.438 --> 18:11.984
we are gonna turn this place
into a real fortress!

18:12.067 --> 18:13.401
With high-tech camouflage,

18:13.485 --> 18:15.403
and I'll lay in enough banana chips

18:15.487 --> 18:18.782
and other survival food
to last a lifetime!

18:18.866 --> 18:22.953
So no matter what happens,
no one from down there, or anywhere,

18:23.036 --> 18:25.413
will ever be able to hurt you.

18:25.497 --> 18:26.957
- [crackling]
- Check it out, Dad!

18:27.040 --> 18:30.293
I made it so it can crush anything
that gets in our way!

18:31.169 --> 18:32.755
[clanging]

18:34.589 --> 18:37.050
Very impressive.

18:37.134 --> 18:39.803
[chuckling] Well, I'm proud of you, son.

18:40.888 --> 18:43.640
Thanks, Dad, but it's still not right.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.475
If I could just use your laser,

18:45.558 --> 18:48.061
I know I could get it as smooth
and shiny as my design.

18:48.145 --> 18:49.813
Out of the question, Richard.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.190
You know my lasers are off-limits.

18:52.274 --> 18:54.192
I don't see what's the big deal!

18:54.276 --> 18:55.736
I've watched you use them.

18:55.819 --> 18:57.988
No, they're too dangerous.

18:58.071 --> 19:01.074
But maybe when I have time,
I can do it for you.

19:01.158 --> 19:03.493
No! This is my invention!

19:03.576 --> 19:05.412
I have to do it all myself.

19:05.495 --> 19:08.999
Well, I think it looks amazing
and you did a great job.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.333
[clanging]

19:16.757 --> 19:18.175
[Kong hooting]

19:20.052 --> 19:21.178
See you after work.

19:21.261 --> 19:24.722
Dad, I can't find my computer tablet
with my school assignments.

19:24.807 --> 19:28.018
I'm sure I left it on my desk,
but it's not there anymore.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.812
I've looked everywhere for it!

19:29.895 --> 19:31.354
We have been searching, too.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.689
[Chatter] Bawk! No luck!

19:32.773 --> 19:35.275
I thought I saw Lukas
take it outside yesterday

19:35.358 --> 19:37.277
when he went to play
with Kong after class.

19:37.360 --> 19:38.946
No, I'm sure I didn't.

19:39.029 --> 19:40.030
[grunting]

19:40.113 --> 19:43.658
But now I can't do my classes online
and I have a big exam tomorrow.

19:43.741 --> 19:46.369
It's not like you to lose
something so important.

19:46.453 --> 19:48.789
Well, you'll have to fly
into the city with me today

19:48.872 --> 19:50.207
and buy a new tablet.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.375
[Lukas] I'm really sorry, Dad.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.752
I swear, I don't understand
how it happened.

19:54.837 --> 19:56.922
Richard, would you like to come with us?

19:57.005 --> 20:00.383
Thanks, Dad, but I really shouldn't
skip class today.

20:00.467 --> 20:03.053
Not with the big exam coming up.

20:04.972 --> 20:06.639

Dad's gonna see how right I was.

Then he'll really be proud of me!

No, Dr. Remy, I do not see
Richard or Kong,

but I call 911 and they are
sending a medivac...

21:40.650 --> 21:43.445
- [Kong coughing]
- [Anita gasps] I see them!

21:43.528 --> 21:46.198
Kong is carrying Richard out of your lab!

21:52.329 --> 21:54.706
I'm sorry, I wish I could tell you.

21:54.789 --> 21:57.834
Only Richard and Kong
know what really happened in there.

22:03.340 --> 22:04.799
Anita, did you talk to Dad?

- [Kong hoots]

22:13.976 --> 22:16.061

22:16.144 --> 22:20.732
I am afraid Richard told your father
that it was all Kong's fault.

22:20.815 --> 22:22.650
[stammers] What? No way!

22:22.734 --> 22:25.903
Your brother said he saw
Kong go into the lab

22:25.988 --> 22:27.905
and he was just trying to stop him.

22:27.990 --> 22:29.116
- I don't believe it.
- [Kong grunts]

22:29.199 --> 22:30.575
Kong would never disobey Dad,

22:30.658 --> 22:33.745
even if there was something in the lab
he wanted, which there isn't!

22:33.828 --> 22:38.000
Richard has begged your father to get rid
of Kong for causing the accident.

22:38.083 --> 22:40.918
Come on, Anita,
we both know Richard's lying.

22:41.003 --> 22:43.505
I just can't let anything bad
happen to Kong.

22:43.588 --> 22:47.134
Your father said Richard will need
to be away for some time.

22:47.217 --> 22:49.344
But he should be as good as new...

22:49.427 --> 22:52.597
thanks to advancements in bionics.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.267
Bionics? You mean Richard will be...

[Anita sniffles] I can't believe I have to
say goodbye to one of my boys.

23:27.465 --> 23:28.591
[sobbing]

23:28.675 --> 23:31.178
[blows nose]

23:31.261 --> 23:32.929
I know, Anita.

23:33.012 --> 23:34.972
It's hard for all of us.

23:35.057 --> 23:40.478
Son, I understand why your mother wants
you living in Boston with her, but...

23:40.562 --> 23:41.563
please.

23:41.646 --> 23:44.232
I wish you'd change your mind
and stay with us.

23:44.316 --> 23:47.944
Me, too. Come on, Richard, don't go.
We can work it out.

23:49.487 --> 23:51.281
[Richard] Okay, I'll stay...

23:52.282 --> 23:53.491
if Kong goes!

23:55.285 --> 23:56.953
[Lukas groans] You know he can't!

23:57.036 --> 23:58.996
This is the only place Kong's safe.

23:59.081 --> 24:04.461
Dad, how can you stick up for that
disgusting ape after what he did to me?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.296
Enough, Richard.

24:06.379 --> 24:09.006
I found your dinosaur model.

24:09.091 --> 24:10.925
I know what you did.

24:11.008 --> 24:13.095
Kong saved your life.

24:13.178 --> 24:14.471
[Richard scoffs]

24:14.554 --> 24:15.847
Well, I'm glad I'm going!

24:17.014 --> 24:19.934
I'm tired of living in this dumb forest,
in this ugly house,

24:20.017 --> 24:22.770
having to share everything with my brother
and his stinking ape!

24:22.854 --> 24:25.648
[Leo] Take it easy, Richard!

24:25.732 --> 24:27.817
Everything will be okay.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.902
I'll see you often.

24:29.986 --> 24:33.740
With all the advancements we're making
in bionics and prosthetics,

24:33.823 --> 24:37.285
why, it won't be long before
you're looking like your old self again.

24:38.828 --> 24:40.413
I'm glad I look different.

24:41.123 --> 24:42.957
I hated being a twin.

24:45.793 --> 24:46.919
[lightning crackles]

24:47.920 --> 24:52.300
Last report said that the storm may
force rescuers to abandon the search.

24:52.384 --> 24:55.220
I pray they can find
the missing campers in time.

24:55.303 --> 24:58.515
I'm so grateful you called Lukas
to come help.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.309
[Leo chuckles] Well, luckily,
he wasn't too far away.

25:01.393 --> 25:04.521
You know they were wrapping up
a whale rescue in Alaska?

25:04.604 --> 25:07.149
They had just delivered the injured beluga

25:07.232 --> 25:10.235
to the marine sanctuary in Seattle
when I called.

25:11.403 --> 25:13.112
Good to see you, son.

25:13.196 --> 25:14.322
You too, Dad.

25:15.323 --> 25:17.492
[laughs] Hey, bro! You miss me?

25:17.575 --> 25:19.369
[chittering]

25:22.455 --> 25:23.873
[blows nose]

25:24.749 --> 25:26.918
Ahhh! Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck!

25:27.001 --> 25:29.879
[laughs] Okay, that was seriously gross.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.381
Even for you, big guy.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.507
[Kong chuckles]

25:33.800 --> 25:35.635
Good to see you again, Dr. Remy.

25:35.718 --> 25:37.512
You too, Anita.

25:37.595 --> 25:39.514
Thanks for getting here so quickly,
Jonesy.

25:39.597 --> 25:42.184
I know how important your rescue work is.

25:42.267 --> 25:45.228
Well, we couldn't have saved
half the animals without your bionics,

25:45.312 --> 25:46.521
so let's call it even, sir.

25:46.604 --> 25:50.149
Now, don't forget to give credit
to Lukas' brother, Richard.

25:50.233 --> 25:53.570
He's made incredible advancements
in bionics and robotics

25:53.653 --> 25:56.406
in my lab for the past three years.

25:56.489 --> 25:59.367
None of us would be able to do
what we do without Richard's...

25:59.451 --> 26:01.494
Storm's building fast, we need to move.

26:01.578 --> 26:05.248
If we don't find the missing campers soon,
they'll freeze up there tonight.

26:07.459 --> 26:08.585
According to reports,

26:08.668 --> 26:11.504
they were last seen headed towards
a place called Edgewood Ravine.

26:11.588 --> 26:12.755
[grunting]

26:12.839 --> 26:14.466
Yeah, Kong and I used to hike there.

26:14.549 --> 26:17.969
Until we realized how unstable
the entire area is.

26:18.052 --> 26:20.137
Doesn't take much to trigger a landslide.

26:20.222 --> 26:22.557
Bro, you need to stay here
with Dad and Anita.

26:22.640 --> 26:25.142
Lay low, make sure none
of the searchers see you, okay?

26:25.227 --> 26:26.686
[chitters]

26:38.698 --> 26:40.325
[lightning cracks]

26:40.408 --> 26:41.659
Roger that.

26:41.743 --> 26:45.622
Bad news. Storm's already grounded
the rest of the rescue teams.

26:45.705 --> 26:49.459
Looks like we're their only hope.
Heat sensors picking up anything?

26:49.542 --> 26:51.085
Ah... no.

26:51.168 --> 26:54.756
The cliffs are loaded with shallow caves
that make the sensors useless.

27:00.553 --> 27:01.763
[children gasp]

27:02.972 --> 27:05.683
Daddy, it's getting really cold.

27:05.767 --> 27:08.019
I want to go home, please.

27:08.102 --> 27:12.231
Honey, I told you, we can't move
because of the landslide.

27:12.315 --> 27:14.942
But I'm sure Mommy has
rescue teams looking for us.

27:15.026 --> 27:17.779
We just need to stay safe until they come.

27:18.780 --> 27:20.031
I hear something!

27:20.114 --> 27:21.949
It sounds like a helicopter!

27:27.372 --> 27:29.624
Not sure how much more she can take.

27:29.707 --> 27:31.334
We can't give up, Jonesy.

27:31.418 --> 27:34.253
- Hey, who said anything about...
- [alarm beeping]

27:37.674 --> 27:40.843
- What is it?
- Main thrusters are down.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.846
The backup can't handle
this kind of beating much longer.

27:43.930 --> 27:46.391
I'm sorry, Lukas,
but if we don't head back now,

27:46.474 --> 27:48.560
they'll be searching
for our wreckage at first light.

27:49.226 --> 27:50.562
[lightning cracks]

27:54.148 --> 27:57.485
[girl] Don't leave! We're here!

27:58.277 --> 28:00.237
Help! We're stuck!

28:00.322 --> 28:02.740
Daddy, what are we gonna do now?

28:02.824 --> 28:04.867
[thudding]

28:04.951 --> 28:07.286
- [children gasp]
- Did you hear something?

28:11.374 --> 28:12.834
[Kong grunts]

28:12.917 --> 28:14.293
[all gasp]

28:17.088 --> 28:19.507
Daddy! It's Bigfoot!

28:19.591 --> 28:23.052
No way,
it looks like my little monkey doll...

28:23.135 --> 28:26.348
only way bigger.

28:28.057 --> 28:29.434
[grunts]

28:29.517 --> 28:30.977
[children screaming]

28:31.936 --> 28:36.315
Well, whatever it is, kids, it's clearly
risking its life to get to us.

28:36.399 --> 28:40.612
Or maybe it's super hungry
and we look tasty.

28:42.489 --> 28:44.031
[chittering]

28:46.117 --> 28:48.411
He wants us to climb on!

28:48.495 --> 28:50.204
[hooting]

28:50.663 --> 28:52.457
I think we should trust him.

28:53.666 --> 28:55.084
[grunts]

29:00.047 --> 29:01.424
Thank you.

29:01.508 --> 29:04.010
See? He's saving us!

29:07.389 --> 29:09.265
[chittering]

29:09.349 --> 29:10.850
Go on, Donny.

29:10.933 --> 29:13.185
This amazing creature is our last...

29:13.269 --> 29:14.604
and only hope.

29:16.105 --> 29:18.441
It's gonna be okay now, Donny.

29:18.525 --> 29:19.776
We're saved.

29:21.486 --> 29:22.862
[lightning cracks]

29:24.906 --> 29:26.408
[chittering nervously]

29:28.159 --> 29:29.994
- [man yelps]
- [children yelling] Daddy!

29:30.828 --> 29:32.414
[screaming]

29:32.497 --> 29:33.665
[Kong roars]

29:40.380 --> 29:41.756
[roars]

29:44.926 --> 29:46.428
[grunts]

29:46.969 --> 29:48.262
[children scream]

29:51.307 --> 29:52.475
[Kong grunting]

30:05.362 --> 30:07.239
[roaring]

30:12.119 --> 30:14.080
We're okay!

30:14.163 --> 30:15.582
Are you okay?

30:15.665 --> 30:17.625
[hooting]

30:30.096 --> 30:32.223
Everything checked out.
Chopper's ready to go.

30:32.306 --> 30:34.016
Then let's do it!

30:34.100 --> 30:35.560
But it'd be a miracle if they survived

30:35.643 --> 30:37.311
the freezing temperatures
up there last night.

30:37.394 --> 30:39.188
[faint thudding]

30:40.607 --> 30:44.527
Looks like they had a great big
beautiful ape keeping them warm!

30:47.739 --> 30:49.449
What in the world is that thing?

30:49.532 --> 30:53.911
That, my friends, is an amazing hero
that just saved three lives!

30:54.454 --> 30:56.623
[kissing loudly] We love you.

30:56.706 --> 30:58.374
[kissing loudly] You're the best.

31:00.376 --> 31:02.003
[grunts] Proud of you, bro!

31:02.086 --> 31:05.047
[chuckling] Even though
you didn't exactly lay low.

31:05.131 --> 31:07.049
[grunts]

31:07.133 --> 31:08.843
[girl] We will never forget you.

31:08.926 --> 31:09.927
[kisses]

31:17.894 --> 31:19.937
You gotta know this is gonna go viral,

31:20.021 --> 31:22.524
so looks like the whole world's
about to meet your big bro.

31:22.607 --> 31:24.441
What's that saying?

31:24.526 --> 31:26.486
"No good deed goes unpunished."

31:28.946 --> 31:33.785
<i>This magnificent creature
risked his life to save my family.</i>

31:33.868 --> 31:36.453
<i>Kong is a real live superhero.</i>

31:36.538 --> 31:38.915
[Richard] Oh, I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.417
<i>While there are many demanding
that this incredibly powerful</i>

31:41.501 --> 31:44.461
<i>and potentially dangerous wild beast
be destroyed,</i>

31:44.546 --> 31:46.213
<i>the governor's office admits</i>

31:46.297 --> 31:49.842
<i>that pleas to spare its life
are pouring in from around the world.</i>

31:49.926 --> 31:51.803
- [Richard] Sound off.
- [TV mutes]

31:51.886 --> 31:54.889
[Richard] Why can't they see
that freak for what he really is?

31:54.972 --> 31:57.433
Pictures do not lie...

31:57.517 --> 31:59.393
unless they are frauds.

31:59.476 --> 32:01.270
You mean like you, Botila?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.773
Negative, I am very real.

32:03.856 --> 32:07.694
I am the most highly advanced bionobot
in the known universe.

32:07.777 --> 32:10.738
Yes, I get that, I created you.

32:10.822 --> 32:12.907
And don't ever forget it.

32:12.990 --> 32:14.701
Sound up.

32:14.784 --> 32:16.703
[reporter on TV] <i>We are going live
to Dr. Leo Remy's home</i>

32:16.786 --> 32:18.287
<i>in the California Redwoods,</i>

32:18.370 --> 32:21.457
<i>where authorities are attempting
to capture the gigantic ape</i>

32:21.541 --> 32:23.417
<i>now known as Kong.</i>

32:23.500 --> 32:25.169
Okay.

32:25.252 --> 32:27.254
This is more like it.

32:27.338 --> 32:28.881
[grunting]

32:28.965 --> 32:32.468
Commissioner, please,
Kong hasn't done anything!

32:32.552 --> 32:34.511
[Anita blows raspberry] Of course he has.

32:34.596 --> 32:37.890
Kong just saved two beautiful
little children and their daddy.

32:37.974 --> 32:39.976
And this is how you thank him?

32:40.059 --> 32:42.687
[Chatter] Take cover! Bawk! Awk!

32:43.479 --> 32:45.732
[roaring]

32:46.315 --> 32:50.945
I give you my word,
Kong is completely harmless!

32:51.028 --> 32:54.657
Dr. Remy, we've been down
this road before.

32:54.741 --> 32:57.827
Yes, when you were still a police captain.

32:57.910 --> 33:01.330
Congratulations on your promotion,
Commissioner Decker.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.165
Uh, thanks, Doc.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.917
But I'll be back pounding a beat

33:05.001 --> 33:07.754
if you can't get that beast of yours
to surrender.

33:07.837 --> 33:09.421
[men grunting]

33:09.505 --> 33:12.258
[man] Let me out of here! Help!

33:12.341 --> 33:16.553
Dr. Remy, I need that thing
to put my men down right now!

33:16.638 --> 33:17.805
Understood.

33:17.889 --> 33:20.933
But I need your officers to back down.

33:21.017 --> 33:23.936
[Decker] My men will be
forced to open fire!

33:24.020 --> 33:26.147
Stop! What are you doing?

33:26.230 --> 33:28.440
Protecting my little boy!

33:28.524 --> 33:30.192
Hold your fire!

33:30.276 --> 33:33.445
You put those nice policemen down
this instant!

33:33.529 --> 33:36.365
I mean it! Or no more cookies ever!

33:36.448 --> 33:37.574
[grunts]

33:37.659 --> 33:41.621
Do it for me, please, <i>mi hijo!
Por tu Anita!</i>

33:41.704 --> 33:43.164
[sighs]

33:44.581 --> 33:47.877
[Anita gasps] That's my good boy.

33:47.960 --> 33:52.048
I am going to bake you the biggest batch
of banana chip cookies!

33:52.131 --> 33:53.132
[laughing]

33:53.215 --> 33:54.801
[chitters happily]

33:56.468 --> 34:01.182
He not only obeyed, but he actually
seemed to understand her.

34:01.265 --> 34:03.434
But what would have happened
if she wasn't here?

34:03.517 --> 34:05.519
It could have ended very badly!

34:06.103 --> 34:07.229
[kisses]

34:07.980 --> 34:09.273
[blows raspberry]

34:10.274 --> 34:13.569
[laughing] Hey, he's like
my two-year-old nephew.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.947
Actually, Commissioner,

34:16.030 --> 34:20.409
Kong's mind is on par with
a two- or three-year-old human child.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.746
What's most important, as you can see,

34:23.830 --> 34:28.167
he understands the difference
between right and wrong.

34:28.250 --> 34:31.503
So the question is,
what to do with this giant?

34:31.587 --> 34:33.422
There's still a lot of people demanding

34:33.505 --> 34:36.132
that the governor do something
about this threat.

34:36.217 --> 34:39.219
Tell him I promise to find a way.

34:39.303 --> 34:41.638
[Decker] Trouble is,
we don't really have a facility

34:41.723 --> 34:44.225
big enough or strong enough to hold him.

34:44.308 --> 34:46.601
Hmm, yes.

34:46.686 --> 34:47.853
Ah!

34:47.937 --> 34:53.317
But what about the most famous,
inescapable prison ever built?

34:53.400 --> 34:55.319
Alcatraz.

34:55.402 --> 34:59.615
[reporter] <i>In the last few weeks,
literally tens of thousands of people</i>

34:59.699 --> 35:02.618
<i>have flocked to San Francisco
from all around the world</i>

35:02.702 --> 35:05.454
in hopes of catching a glimpse
of the giant ape

35:05.537 --> 35:09.000
that, ironically, has been exiled
to Alcatraz Island.

35:09.709 --> 35:12.419
In appreciation
for the outpouring of support,

35:12.503 --> 35:15.339
Dr. Leo Remy has built a special tower

35:15.422 --> 35:18.467
in the center of the island
for Kong to climb...

35:18.550 --> 35:20.094
[hooting]

35:21.262 --> 35:22.764
[roaring]

35:24.431 --> 35:28.352
...making it easier for the world
to see this freak of nature.

35:28.435 --> 35:33.107
It would appear Kong, King of the Apes,
is a born entertainer.

35:33.190 --> 35:35.818
Perhaps that's why rumors are flying

35:35.902 --> 35:38.237
that Alcatraz Island
may soon be transformed

35:38.320 --> 35:40.156
into Kong Island.

35:44.994 --> 35:46.453
[grunting]

35:49.206 --> 35:53.419
[Lukas laughing] Good to see you, too,
you big show-off!

35:58.465 --> 36:01.677
Hey, Dad, everything okay?
What's the big news?

36:01.761 --> 36:04.096
I've been wondering the same thing.

36:05.431 --> 36:06.557
Richard.

36:07.308 --> 36:08.517
Lukas.

36:12.188 --> 36:13.898
I need your help,

36:13.981 --> 36:15.817
both my sons,

36:15.900 --> 36:18.861
to fulfill my lifelong dream.

36:18.945 --> 36:21.488
Thanks to Kong's extraordinary fame,

36:21.572 --> 36:24.826
I have the governor's blessing,
plus all the funding needed,

36:24.909 --> 36:29.038
to create the Remy Natural History
and Marine Preserve

36:29.121 --> 36:30.539
right here on the island!

36:30.622 --> 36:32.249
That's great, Dad!

36:32.333 --> 36:36.796
But, son, there is one major condition.

36:36.879 --> 36:41.467
They insist Kong be fitted
with a special control collar.

36:41.550 --> 36:43.219
No, no, no, forget that!

36:43.302 --> 36:45.762
Lukas, it's the only way.

36:45.847 --> 36:48.349
Kong wears a collar or they will...

36:48.432 --> 36:49.809
put him away.

36:51.143 --> 36:56.190
Richard, I assured them that you could
design the control collar for me.

36:56.273 --> 36:59.651
It will be my pleasure
to do this for you, Dad.

37:00.486 --> 37:02.071
[Kong grunts nervously]

37:03.114 --> 37:09.161
Lukas, we have the opportunity to create
a real and lasting sanctuary

37:09.245 --> 37:13.415
for the injured and endangered species
you and Jonesy rescue.

37:13.499 --> 37:17.879
A safe haven to protect
against future extinctions.

37:17.962 --> 37:20.464
Richard, with your exceptional
talents in robotics,

37:20.547 --> 37:24.343
you'll be able to bring natural history
to life like never before.

37:24.426 --> 37:29.098
You could create all of the life-size
dinosaurs you always dreamed of.

37:29.181 --> 37:31.893
So, what do you say?

37:31.976 --> 37:35.312
Well, I'm certainly not going to be
the one that stands in the way

37:35.396 --> 37:37.064
of my father's dream.

37:38.440 --> 37:40.442
[grunts nervously]

37:40.526 --> 37:42.028
Sure, Dad.

37:42.111 --> 37:44.821
I'll help you create... Kong Island.

37:44.906 --> 37:48.159
The Remy Natural History
and Marine Preserve.

37:48.242 --> 37:50.411
[scoffs] Yeah, tell it to them.

37:51.328 --> 37:53.205
[crowd laughing]

37:53.289 --> 37:54.748
Hey, I'm Doug Jones.

37:54.831 --> 37:56.292
My friends call me Jonesy.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.545
Botila. I do not have friends.

38:00.546 --> 38:03.590
Uh, trust me, Jonesy, you really don't
want to fall for that one.

38:03.674 --> 38:05.342
I'd never make a move
on your brother's woman.

38:05.426 --> 38:07.719
[laughs] How about his bionobot?

38:07.803 --> 38:10.389
Say what? You mean she's...

38:10.472 --> 38:13.684
- [exclaims] Unreal!
- [Lukas] Exactly.

38:13.767 --> 38:16.437
[automated voice on PA] <i>Intruder alert!
Intruder alert!</i>

38:16.520 --> 38:18.522
- Our security walls have been breached!
- [Richard] Hmm.

38:18.605 --> 38:21.483
See? Not everyone is a fan.

38:21.567 --> 38:24.695
There have also been
many threats against your ape.

38:24.778 --> 38:27.114
Sounds like someone plans
to make good on one.

38:27.198 --> 38:29.741
We keep these on board
to warn off poachers in the wild.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.994
No, Botila will handle them.

38:32.078 --> 38:35.456
I programmed her with every known
martial arts move.

38:36.373 --> 38:39.710
I have a few belts of my own,
maybe we can work out together sometime.

38:39.793 --> 38:43.214
As long as Kong is around,
we don't need weapons or Botila.

38:44.215 --> 38:45.632
[grunting]

38:47.051 --> 38:48.719
[roaring]

38:54.391 --> 38:56.643
Who are you and what do you want?

38:56.727 --> 39:01.482
Sorry to trespass, but you are
a very hard man to reach, Dr. Remy.

39:01.565 --> 39:04.610
I am Dr. Amy Quon
and this is my brother, Danny.

39:06.237 --> 39:09.281
Nice to meet you.
Now get off our island.

39:09.365 --> 39:13.327
Kong, dump them back in their boat
or whatever they used to trespass.

39:13.410 --> 39:16.080
[grunting]

39:16.163 --> 39:17.539
[laughing]

39:17.623 --> 39:20.334
He says, "Do it yourself."
He doesn't work for you.

39:20.417 --> 39:22.378
[chuckling]

39:22.461 --> 39:27.799
[scoffs] I suppose you came here
to say this boy can talk to apes.

39:27.883 --> 39:31.137
Kong's the first ape I ever met,
but yeah, turns out I can.

39:31.220 --> 39:34.390
[laughs] You know, you guys got
a seriously funny gorilla here.

39:34.473 --> 39:37.518
I've heard enough of this nonsense.
Time to throw them out.

39:37.601 --> 39:39.603
Actually, I want to hear more.

39:39.686 --> 39:42.314
I'm rather curious myself.

39:42.398 --> 39:44.691
So, Danny, what else is Kong telling you?

39:44.775 --> 39:47.403
That he really wants you to let me
and my sis work here with him.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.487
[grunts]

39:48.570 --> 39:49.946
[chuckles] Okay, I made that up.

39:50.031 --> 39:52.783
But I'm pretty sure he would have said it
if he knew that's why we came.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.661
[Lukas] How the heck did he know
what Kong was saying?

39:55.744 --> 39:58.414
Danny is a certified animal whisperer,

39:58.497 --> 40:01.542
and I'm a licensed veterinarian,
specializing in primates,

40:01.625 --> 40:03.502
particularly anthropoids.

40:03.585 --> 40:06.880
But, as you know, there are hardly
any left in the world.

40:06.963 --> 40:11.010
Just a few in zoos
and none that we know of in the wild.

40:11.093 --> 40:15.431
And certainly no creature on Earth
like Kong.

40:15.514 --> 40:18.184
I will do anything to be part of his team.

40:18.267 --> 40:20.102
She means, "We will."

40:20.186 --> 40:21.312
[whispering]

40:21.395 --> 40:23.522
- [Kong laughing]
- Oh, man!

40:23.605 --> 40:25.941
I'm gonna need hazard pay
and a snot protector.

40:26.025 --> 40:27.901
[laughs] I'm not kidding!

40:27.984 --> 40:29.028
Ugh!

40:29.111 --> 40:32.614
We will, of course,
need to verify your credentials,

40:32.698 --> 40:34.783
but I was already planning
to bring on a vet

40:34.866 --> 40:37.036
to care for the injured
and endangered animals

40:37.119 --> 40:40.039
Lukas and Jonesy will be
bringing to the preserve.

40:40.122 --> 40:42.916
If you check out, you're in.

40:42.999 --> 40:45.086
I promise, we both will.

40:45.169 --> 40:48.964
And it looks like Kong's already
hired himself a translator.

40:51.217 --> 40:52.218
[crowd laughing]

40:53.635 --> 40:56.097
[both laughing]

40:57.431 --> 40:59.433
Amy and Danny Quon...

40:59.516 --> 41:01.518
welcome to the team.

41:01.602 --> 41:02.894
[Danny] Shake on it, mega broski!

41:02.978 --> 41:04.480
[both laughing]

41:08.567 --> 41:10.694
Let them laugh now.

41:10.777 --> 41:14.198
They won't be laughing when I'm finished
with that hideous ape.

41:16.533 --> 41:18.410
[grunting]

41:20.579 --> 41:22.123
Come on, Dad.

41:22.206 --> 41:23.540
You can't do this to him.

41:23.624 --> 41:25.376
I'm sorry, Lukas.

41:25.459 --> 41:29.421
But either Kong wears the control collar
Richard made for him or he...

41:29.505 --> 41:30.839
Just relax.

41:30.922 --> 41:35.427
As long as your ape behaves himself,
we'll never have to use this.

41:35.511 --> 41:37.346
But, if he does get out of hand,

41:37.429 --> 41:41.308
the pain I can inflict will bring
Kong to his knees.

41:41.392 --> 41:43.602
Dad, you know Kong doesn't deserve this.

41:43.685 --> 41:45.896
[sighs] This is so wrong.

41:45.979 --> 41:47.398
I can't watch.

41:51.818 --> 41:54.571
- [electricity buzzing]
- [Kong groaning]

41:54.655 --> 41:57.199
Hey, buddy, I know how you feel.

41:57.283 --> 41:58.825
Amy made me wear a tie once...

41:58.909 --> 42:00.119
Totally hated it.

42:00.202 --> 42:01.203
[grunts]

42:01.287 --> 42:03.289
- [buzzing]
- [groaning]

42:03.372 --> 42:04.415
[Danny exclaims]

42:05.291 --> 42:06.375
[Danny] Help!

42:08.877 --> 42:10.379
[chuckles] It's okay.

42:10.462 --> 42:12.423
But you better leave that collar alone.

42:12.506 --> 42:13.674
[grumbles]

42:13.757 --> 42:14.883
Don't look so bummed.

42:14.966 --> 42:19.430
At least now the Remys can start turning
this rock into Kong Island!

42:19.513 --> 42:21.265
- Finger five?
- [grunts unhappily]

42:22.224 --> 42:24.310
Aw, come on, man, give it up!

42:24.393 --> 42:27.979
'Cause very soon you're gonna be
a full-blown superstar!

42:30.774 --> 42:33.235
Just don't forget, I knew you when...

42:39.283 --> 42:41.993
Can you believe how fast
this place is coming together?

42:46.290 --> 42:47.958
[worker] Okay!

42:49.418 --> 42:50.669
[indistinct chatter]

42:50.752 --> 42:53.088
- [pipes clattering]
- [workers yelling]

42:54.005 --> 42:55.966
- [workers screaming]
- [pipes thudding]

42:58.260 --> 43:00.304
[workers sighing] Thank you!

43:02.055 --> 43:04.891
You may loath Kong, but you must admit...

43:04.975 --> 43:06.727
he is quite the hero.

43:06.810 --> 43:08.895
He's nothing but a dumb ape.

43:08.979 --> 43:10.939
Look at him. He's pathetic.

43:12.608 --> 43:14.360
By my calculations,

43:14.443 --> 43:20.366
that dumb, pathetic ape just saved you
20 man-hours of highly-skilled labor.

43:25.871 --> 43:27.206
[thudding]

43:28.790 --> 43:30.334
[whirring]

43:36.965 --> 43:38.425
[electricity crackling]

43:48.018 --> 43:50.604
[Leo] I am so proud of you, son.

43:50.687 --> 43:52.564
Then wait until you see...

43:54.358 --> 43:55.359
this!

43:56.360 --> 43:57.403
[growling]

43:57.486 --> 44:00.447
[Leo] I remember when
you were a boy, you said

44:00.531 --> 44:03.992
your inventions would one day
surpass mine.

44:04.075 --> 44:07.246
[chuckles] Well, congratulations, son.

44:07.329 --> 44:08.914
You've finally done it.

44:08.997 --> 44:10.541
[roaring]

44:12.459 --> 44:14.295
- [collar buzzing]
- [roaring]

44:25.681 --> 44:27.766
[Anita] Hey, Dr. Remy,
what are you doing here?

44:27.849 --> 44:28.850
You are too pale.

44:28.934 --> 44:31.895
You should be in bed,
eating the chicken soup I made for you.

44:31.978 --> 44:34.147
I... [coughing]
I'm fine, Anita.

44:34.230 --> 44:35.482
Just...

44:35.566 --> 44:37.818
just a little tired is all.

44:37.901 --> 44:41.572
For so many months now,
you are working much too hard.

44:41.655 --> 44:42.989
All of you.

44:43.073 --> 44:46.368
Not me.
I have an inexhaustible energy source.

44:46.452 --> 44:49.162
- [chuckles] I bet you do.
- Okay.

44:49.245 --> 44:52.416
Richard, we're ready for this big show
you've been promising.

44:52.499 --> 44:55.877
Botila, activate the mobile control panel.

44:57.087 --> 45:00.757
This is what everyone will witness
at tomorrow's grand opening

45:00.841 --> 45:04.260
of the Remy Natural History
and Marine Preserve.

45:04.345 --> 45:07.222
[Danny sighs] Why can't that guy
ever just call it what it is?

45:07.305 --> 45:09.057
Kong Island.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.684
[both laugh]

45:10.767 --> 45:12.143
[exclaims]

45:13.437 --> 45:14.688
[Lukas laughs]

45:15.564 --> 45:17.065
[laughing] Whoa!

45:18.900 --> 45:21.528
Lukas? Earth to Lukas.

45:21.612 --> 45:22.779
[chuckles] Are you okay?

45:22.863 --> 45:26.575
I was just remembering how fun it was
being a kid with Kong.

45:26.658 --> 45:29.035
He's still like a big kid.

45:29.119 --> 45:32.873
Get ready, you are about to see
what I am certain the media will call

45:32.956 --> 45:36.167
the greatest attraction
in theme park history.

45:38.670 --> 45:40.756
[pterodactyl screeching]

45:41.673 --> 45:44.300
Perfect! Aren't they realistic?

45:44.385 --> 45:48.179
This is the reaction I'll get tomorrow
from the media and guests.

45:48.263 --> 45:50.557
Richard, are you...
[coughing]

45:50.641 --> 45:56.438
...are you absolutely certain
it will be completely safe for the public?

45:56.522 --> 45:57.898
Of course.

45:57.981 --> 45:59.483
Don't you trust me?

46:04.070 --> 46:05.280
[screeching]

46:05.363 --> 46:06.907
[Kong roars]

46:08.241 --> 46:10.118
[grunts] I think he's after me!

46:10.201 --> 46:12.538
Stop that, you dumb ape,
before you damage it!

46:12.621 --> 46:16.082
Make that expensive toy of yours back off
before someone gets hurt!

46:16.166 --> 46:18.419
Ugh, bring it down.

46:18.502 --> 46:22.255
Negative. Not possible.
There is no override button.

46:22.338 --> 46:23.924
[roaring]

46:30.305 --> 46:31.640
[roaring]

46:31.723 --> 46:33.058
[pterodactyl screeches]

46:36.061 --> 46:38.647
[sighs] Nice right hook, dude!

46:38.730 --> 46:42.484
That pterodactyl was programmed
to lead the air show tomorrow.

46:42.568 --> 46:44.861
There isn't nearly enough time
to replace it.

46:44.945 --> 46:48.073
That filthy ape destroyed
everything again!

46:48.156 --> 46:50.408
Now, it will be fine.

46:50.492 --> 46:53.704
You still have many more pterodactyls,

46:53.787 --> 46:59.417
plus, I'm sure everyone will be awed
by all your other amazing creatures.

46:59.501 --> 47:02.588
You know, Richard, if you don't want
Kong to break your toys,

47:02.671 --> 47:04.965
maybe you shouldn't
use them to torment him.

47:12.055 --> 47:15.684
Everyone who is anyone is here,
the mayor, governor,

47:15.767 --> 47:19.605
and frankly, too many movie stars
and celebrities to count...

47:19.688 --> 47:22.398
All here to congratulate Dr. Leo Remy

47:22.483 --> 47:26.361
on his latest and unquestionably
greatest achievement.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.404
<i>In addition to becoming a sanctuary</i>

47:28.489 --> 47:31.282
<i>for many of the world's
remaining endangered species,</i>

47:31.366 --> 47:34.244
<i>a massive aquarium encircles the island,</i>

47:34.327 --> 47:36.788
<i>created to protect
all kinds of marine life.</i>

47:38.749 --> 47:42.503
<i>The Remy Natural History
and Marine Preserve,</i>

47:42.586 --> 47:46.757
<i>already more commonly referred to as
"Kong Island,"</i>

47:46.840 --> 47:49.551
<i>is also home to many extinct species,</i>

47:49.635 --> 47:51.678
<i>such as prehistoric dinosaurs.</i>

47:51.762 --> 47:54.347
<i>Pterodactyls, triceratops,</i>

47:54.430 --> 47:56.642
<i>and even</i> Tyrannosaurus rex!

47:56.725 --> 48:01.563
<i>Of course they are all just harmless
bionobots created by Dr. Richard Remy.</i>

48:01.647 --> 48:03.439
[cheering]

48:03.524 --> 48:07.986
<i>Like the terrifying megalodons
and other prehistoric sea creatures.</i>

48:08.069 --> 48:10.614
<i>And even a monstrous giant squid,</i>

48:10.697 --> 48:14.325
<i>programmed to shock and delight
visitors arriving on the monorail.</i>

48:14.409 --> 48:16.036
<i>Everyone is suitably awed</i>

48:16.119 --> 48:19.665
<i>by all of the life-size dinosaurs
and marine monsters.</i>

48:19.748 --> 48:21.750
[Kong roaring]

48:21.833 --> 48:23.669
[crowd clamoring excitedly]

48:25.086 --> 48:28.131
But, clearly, everyone has come
to see Kong.

48:28.214 --> 48:32.761
<i>The one and only living,
breathing King of the Apes!</i>

48:32.844 --> 48:34.555
[roaring]

48:35.597 --> 48:37.223
[crowd cheering]

48:42.270 --> 48:44.064
[scoffs] I taught him that!

48:44.147 --> 48:46.692
We call it, "The mega butt bow."

48:46.775 --> 48:50.028
[laughing] Looks like
a real crowd pleaser.

48:50.111 --> 48:52.072
Your dad looks pretty pleased, too.

48:52.155 --> 48:55.158
Well, Dr. Remy, you pulled it off.

48:55.241 --> 48:56.868
Congratulations!

48:56.952 --> 48:59.705
Definitely a monumental day
for the Remy family.

48:59.788 --> 49:02.498
Yeah, so I wonder where Richard is.

49:02.583 --> 49:05.168
[Lukas] <i>I figured he'd be
eating up all this press.</i>

49:05.251 --> 49:10.173
It seems very few people are interested
in your artificial dinosaurs,

49:10.256 --> 49:12.050
now that Kong has appeared.

49:12.133 --> 49:13.594
Everything would be different

49:13.677 --> 49:17.430
if they had been able to witness
my spectacular pterodactyl air show.

49:17.513 --> 49:18.932
Perhaps.

49:19.015 --> 49:21.768
However, for some incalculable reason,

49:21.852 --> 49:26.648
humans are not simply fascinated by Kong,
they are drawn to him.

49:26.732 --> 49:29.693
Because most of them
are just ignorant fools,

49:29.776 --> 49:31.737
willing to pay to watch a freak of nature

49:31.820 --> 49:34.155
with less intelligence
than a three-year-old!

49:34.239 --> 49:36.825
Ordinary people, like my brother,

49:36.908 --> 49:39.577
are weak, and deserve to become extinct.

49:39.661 --> 49:43.123
The same as all the useless creatures
he's always trying to save!

49:43.206 --> 49:46.877
Bionics and robotics are the future.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.379
I will not argue with that.

49:49.462 --> 49:55.176
And one day I will prove it to him
and the world...

49:55.260 --> 49:59.264
Congratulations, Dr. Remy,
on your phenomenal success.

49:59.347 --> 50:03.644
[stammers] Now, most of the credit
goes to my two sons,

50:03.727 --> 50:06.229
Lukas and Richard,

50:06.312 --> 50:11.234
who I know will keep my dream alive
long after I am gone.

50:19.034 --> 50:20.786
Nearly one year to the day

50:20.869 --> 50:24.790
that the Remy Natural History
and Marine Preserve opened,

50:24.873 --> 50:28.543
its founder, Dr. Leo Remy,
has passed.

50:28.626 --> 50:30.295
[sniffles]

50:32.756 --> 50:34.841
[wailing]

50:37.052 --> 50:38.887
[Lukas] I know, bro...

50:38.970 --> 50:40.346
I miss him, too.

50:42.307 --> 50:44.059
[Richard] I'll make your dream come true.

50:44.142 --> 50:46.812
You mean yours.

50:48.939 --> 50:50.899
[Richard] Find someplace else
to put that thing.

50:50.982 --> 50:54.569
Construction on my new
dinosaur habitat starts today.

50:54.652 --> 50:57.197
Lukas didn't say anything
about moving the seal.

50:58.198 --> 51:01.076
I'm the boss while my brother is away!

51:02.077 --> 51:03.078
[Danny] Shh!

51:04.079 --> 51:05.080
[Lukas shouting] What are you doing?

51:05.163 --> 51:08.083
Don't tell me you're trying to take away
this poor creature's habitat!

51:08.166 --> 51:10.585
It's okay, Abe,
the seal is staying right here.

51:10.668 --> 51:11.712
[seal barks]

51:11.795 --> 51:15.256
We are supposed to be
entertaining our visitors.

51:15.340 --> 51:19.677
One useless seal is about as exciting
as watching paint dry.

51:19.761 --> 51:22.723
Animals aren't just
for your entertainment, Richard.

51:22.806 --> 51:27.060
And, anyway, don't worry,
Jonesy and I plan to rescue a lot more.

51:27.143 --> 51:29.020
You could have a hundred,

51:29.104 --> 51:33.233
but it can't compare to the prehistoric
shark show I've designed.

51:33.316 --> 51:34.735
[Danny laughs] Yeah, right.

51:34.818 --> 51:36.486
A fake-looking old shark.

51:36.569 --> 51:37.779
You keep forgetting,

51:37.863 --> 51:42.283
Dad's dream was for us to save
as many animals as we can from extinction.

51:42.367 --> 51:44.995
I suppose one of them did that to you?

51:45.078 --> 51:47.831
No, the poachers trying
to exterminate her did,

51:47.914 --> 51:50.876
which is why we need
more sanctuary space, not less.

51:50.959 --> 51:54.295
Which is what I came to talk about
in the first place!

51:54.379 --> 51:57.715
On the flight home,
I decided to go over the books.

51:57.799 --> 52:02.053
Turns out, you've already exceeded
your bionobot budget by several million.

52:03.304 --> 52:04.722
You can't stop me.

52:04.806 --> 52:06.141
We're equal partners.

52:06.224 --> 52:08.018
Equal vote in the business.

52:08.101 --> 52:10.896
You forget, Dad left Anita 10%.

52:10.979 --> 52:12.730
Anita agrees with me.

52:12.814 --> 52:14.482
The real animals come first.

52:14.565 --> 52:16.902
And don't even think about trying
something like this again

52:16.985 --> 52:18.569
when I'm away on a rescue mission.

52:19.570 --> 52:21.156
This isn't over.

52:21.239 --> 52:22.908
Actually, it is, Richard...

52:22.991 --> 52:24.534
so live with it.

52:24.617 --> 52:28.579
And now, I've got to go see
how the ligers we rescued are doing.

52:28.663 --> 52:30.415
- [both gasp]
- [Danny] Ligers?

52:32.167 --> 52:33.584
Botila!

52:33.668 --> 52:34.836
Botila?

52:34.920 --> 52:37.088
Where is that blasted bot?

52:38.548 --> 52:40.926
[Danny] I can't believe I'm going to get
a chance to communicate

52:41.009 --> 52:42.468
with a real, live hybrid!

52:42.552 --> 52:46.014
Wonder which language it's gonna speak,
lion or tiger? [laughing]

52:46.681 --> 52:48.058
[Jonesy] Maybe you can ask her.

52:48.724 --> 52:50.685
[growling]

52:50.768 --> 52:52.979
[Danny and Kong exclaiming]

52:53.063 --> 52:57.567
Easy, everyone, we do not
want to frighten the cats.

52:57.650 --> 52:59.610
- What are their names?
- Your sister decided

52:59.694 --> 53:01.905
that since she's such a beautiful
and majestic creature,

53:01.988 --> 53:03.281
we should call her, "Lady."

53:03.364 --> 53:04.532
Sweet!

53:04.615 --> 53:06.617
So, how come you guys had to rescue Lady?

53:06.701 --> 53:11.206
Unfortunately, some people think
it's cool to have an exotic pet.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.541
Then, when they discover
how dangerous they can be,

53:13.624 --> 53:15.085
they release them into the wild,

53:15.168 --> 53:19.339
without realizing most of these animals
never learn to survive in nature.

53:19.422 --> 53:21.674
Especially not with poachers hunting them.

53:22.675 --> 53:23.885
[thudding]

53:25.511 --> 53:26.554
[growls]

53:26.637 --> 53:28.849
Kong, you better back off.

53:28.932 --> 53:30.225
[hoots softly]

53:30.308 --> 53:32.060
Danny, see if you can talk to her.

53:32.143 --> 53:33.561
All right.

53:35.771 --> 53:37.023
[Danny grunts]

53:37.107 --> 53:39.234
- [Danny whispering]
- [liger growling softly]

53:39.317 --> 53:40.360
[growling stops]

53:41.987 --> 53:43.779
Attagirl! Whoa!

53:43.864 --> 53:45.740
[laughs] That's one big puddy cat!

53:46.782 --> 53:47.909
It's okay now.

53:47.993 --> 53:50.536
She gets that you're just
an overgrown softy.

53:50.620 --> 53:53.123
And so is this lovable little fella.

53:53.206 --> 53:55.666
They were very lucky
you found them when you did.

53:55.750 --> 53:56.918
Another day, and...

53:57.002 --> 54:00.171
Hey, that's a perfect name for you! Lucky!

54:00.255 --> 54:01.714
[Kong grunts]

54:01.797 --> 54:03.383
[Danny] Uh, Kong wants to feed him.

54:03.466 --> 54:06.511
Okay, but be very careful.

54:06.594 --> 54:07.888
You don't want to scare him.

54:11.141 --> 54:13.018
- [hooting]
- [Lucky mewing]

54:15.061 --> 54:16.604
[crowd cheering]

54:16.687 --> 54:18.481
You're right, Amy, something's off.

54:18.564 --> 54:20.233
I've examined Kong repeatedly

54:20.316 --> 54:23.153
and found no physical reason
for his attitude shift.

54:23.236 --> 54:25.405
He could just be missing Lukas and Danny.

54:25.488 --> 54:27.698
It's the first time your brother's been
away since you got here.

54:27.782 --> 54:31.661
I know. Danny couldn't pass up the chance
to see what's left of the Amazon.

54:31.744 --> 54:34.414
Lukas has even begun teaching him to fly.

54:35.373 --> 54:37.167
- [Kong snarling]
- [crowd exclaiming]

54:37.250 --> 54:39.127
[roaring]

54:39.210 --> 54:41.379
I've never seen the big guy act like this.

54:41.462 --> 54:43.256
Maybe we should call them back.

54:43.339 --> 54:45.133
Why not get Danny on the holo-screen?

54:45.216 --> 54:47.302
See if he can "read" Kong,
or whatever he does.

54:47.385 --> 54:48.553
- [Kong snarls]
- [crowd gasps]

54:48.636 --> 54:50.388
[roaring]

54:52.223 --> 54:53.558
Let's do it.

54:53.641 --> 54:56.394
[Amy on monitor] <i>So, we're hoping
Danny can tell us what's wrong.</i>

54:56.477 --> 54:58.354
Afraid we can't come back yet.

54:58.438 --> 55:01.232
They're clear-cutting one of
the last sections of rainforest,

55:01.316 --> 55:03.651
and we're hoping to get there
before the poachers close in.

55:03.734 --> 55:05.778
But I can try talking to Kong
over the link.

55:05.861 --> 55:07.948
See if I can get the big guy
to tell me what's up.

55:08.031 --> 55:09.782
Okay, here you go.

55:09.865 --> 55:11.326
- [grunting]
- [Jonesy] Come on, Kong.

55:11.409 --> 55:13.286
Don't you want to say hi
to Lukas and Danny?

55:13.369 --> 55:14.620
<i>Yo, Kong-O!</i>

55:14.704 --> 55:16.872
<i>You bent out of shape 'cause
I took off with your bro?</i>

55:16.957 --> 55:18.583
[laughs] <i>Promise I'll make it up to you</i>

55:18.666 --> 55:21.711
<i>with the biggest super-sized
banana smoothie on the planet!</i>

55:23.588 --> 55:24.755
- [Kong grunts]
- [Jonesy] Whoa!

55:25.756 --> 55:28.551
- [electricity crackling]
- [Kong groans]

55:28.634 --> 55:30.971
I can't believe
Kong would blow me off like that.

55:31.054 --> 55:34.724
I think we'd better move Lady and her cub
out of Kong's habitat.

55:34.807 --> 55:35.933
Just in case.

55:36.017 --> 55:37.978
Maybe we should come back right now.

55:38.061 --> 55:40.855
[Jonesy] <i>I'd hate to see you
abandon the mission when you're so close.</i>

55:40.938 --> 55:43.649
<i>We'll keep a sharp eye on Kong,
but if he gets any worse,</i>

55:43.733 --> 55:45.110
<i>then you'd better come back.</i>

55:48.446 --> 55:49.990
[growls]

55:52.117 --> 55:55.536
Now that I know my do-gooder brother
is far enough away,

55:55.620 --> 55:58.956
it's time to really amp things up.

55:59.040 --> 56:02.043
Increasing the frequency
on Kong's control collar.

56:02.127 --> 56:03.544
[Kong groaning]

56:03.628 --> 56:04.962
Wait! Wait!

56:05.046 --> 56:06.547
Not quite yet.

56:06.631 --> 56:09.425
I just wanted to be certain
that it would work.

56:09.509 --> 56:12.720
We don't want Amy telling Lukas
we need to close the park tomorrow

56:12.803 --> 56:17.100
because his "star attraction"
is actually a deadly savage.

56:17.183 --> 56:18.809
Turn it off...

56:18.893 --> 56:19.977
for now.

56:21.896 --> 56:27.068
I warned Lukas it wasn't over,
but it will be very soon.

56:30.238 --> 56:33.866
Well, I was monitoring Kong all night.
He seemed totally normal.

56:33.949 --> 56:36.369
It definitely looks like
he's back to his old self.

56:36.452 --> 56:37.578
Maybe it was just a bug.

56:39.122 --> 56:42.042
[belching]

56:42.125 --> 56:45.211
- [crowd cheering]
- [Jonesy laughs] Oh, yeah!

56:45.295 --> 56:46.879
The big guy's back.

56:46.962 --> 56:50.675
Good thing, too, because the ticket office
says the place is gonna be jammed.

56:50.758 --> 56:54.179
Apparently, Richard ran some kind of
one-day-only special promotion deal

56:54.262 --> 56:56.556
that's packing them in
even tighter than usual.

56:59.434 --> 57:01.186
[Botila] The monorail has stopped running.

57:01.269 --> 57:03.646
The island is now filled to capacity.

57:06.732 --> 57:07.858
Well, then.

57:07.942 --> 57:09.652
It's showtime!

57:12.738 --> 57:14.949
[beeping]

57:15.741 --> 57:17.202
- [buzzing]
- [roars]

57:19.912 --> 57:21.831
- [crowd laughing]
- [man] What's he doing?

57:22.748 --> 57:24.959
- [roaring]
- [electricity crackling]

57:25.043 --> 57:26.419
[roaring]

57:28.796 --> 57:29.797
Someone make him stop!

57:30.840 --> 57:32.508
[crowd screaming]

57:32.592 --> 57:35.136
- [Jonesy] Take it easy!
- Calm down, please!

57:36.221 --> 57:38.639
Look out! Please, be careful!

57:38.723 --> 57:39.932
Lukas!

57:40.015 --> 57:42.518
<i>Can you hear me? Something has happened.</i>

57:42.602 --> 57:46.272
I know. Richard called a few minutes ago
to say Kong's going berserk

57:46.356 --> 57:48.316
and that everyone's in grave danger.

57:48.399 --> 57:50.443
- But how did Richard...
- [screaming continues]

57:50.526 --> 57:52.237
- It just started! Oh!
- [phone clatters]

57:52.320 --> 57:53.904
- <i>Amy!</i>
- I'm okay.

57:53.988 --> 57:55.656
But we need your help.

57:55.740 --> 57:57.575
[Lukas] We're just outside San Francisco.

57:57.658 --> 58:00.953
Last night, Danny and I both had
the feeling we needed to get back.

58:01.036 --> 58:03.038
I just hope it will be soon enough.

58:03.123 --> 58:04.165
<i>Ahhh!</i>

58:04.249 --> 58:05.625
[monitor beeping]

58:05.708 --> 58:06.834
[Kong growls]

58:09.337 --> 58:10.880
[Kong roars]

58:16.136 --> 58:18.179
- [thudding]
- [screaming continues]

58:21.182 --> 58:23.184
[electricity crackling]

58:25.645 --> 58:27.355
[crowd yelling]

58:35.321 --> 58:36.572
[Kong groans]

58:41.327 --> 58:45.206
I can still increase his pain
by two full decimals.

58:45.290 --> 58:46.416
Not just yet.

58:46.499 --> 58:49.877
I wouldn't want to accidentally
put the beast down...

58:49.960 --> 58:51.296
too quickly.

58:52.755 --> 58:55.425
I am unable to compute your logic.

58:56.551 --> 59:02.014
My extraordinary bionobots need to save
these people from the savage monster,

59:02.097 --> 59:05.017
making me the hero of the hour.

[metal clanging]

59:18.656 --> 59:20.491
[pterodactyls screeching]

59:22.202 --> 59:23.994
Highly logical.

59:24.078 --> 59:26.331
Admirably diabolical.

59:26.414 --> 59:30.168
I am programming them to destroy
only their primary target...

59:31.794 --> 59:33.045
Kong!

59:33.128 --> 59:34.880

01:00:08.206 --> 01:00:09.374
[crowd clamoring]

01:00:09.457 --> 01:00:13.503
Ladies and gentlemen,
please try to remain calm.

01:00:13.586 --> 01:00:15.671
I am Dr. Richard Remy.

01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:17.089
Do not fear.

01:00:17.172 --> 01:00:20.009
<i>My bionobots will stop Kong.</i>

01:00:20.092 --> 01:00:21.844
- [crowd exclaiming]
- [man] He's right!

01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:24.347
[woman] Thank goodness!

01:00:27.016 --> 01:00:28.684

[groaning in pain]

Yes! Get him!

[Kong grunts]

01:01:26.326 --> 01:01:28.077
- [tail clanging]
- [Kong groans]

01:01:30.455 --> 01:01:31.581
[Danny] <i>Oh, no!</i>

01:01:31.664 --> 01:01:34.292
No! No! That thing's gonna destroy him!

01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:35.626
We have to do something!

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:37.420
Believe me, Danny...

01:01:37.503 --> 01:01:38.879
I wish we could.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:48.431
[both straining]

01:01:57.982 --> 01:01:59.108
[roars]

01:02:02.277 --> 01:02:04.029
This is not happening!

01:02:04.113 --> 01:02:06.449
It is definitely occurring in real time.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:10.119
Can't you see he's wiping out
half my bionobots?

01:02:10.953 --> 01:02:12.580
It's a rhetorical question, you...

01:02:14.499 --> 01:02:16.083
[both roaring]

01:02:17.585 --> 01:02:19.128

[roaring]

01:02:25.343 --> 01:02:27.928
I will make Kong pay for this.

01:02:28.012 --> 01:02:30.431
It appears you will need
to catch him first.

01:02:30.515 --> 01:02:32.433
By my calculations,

01:02:32.517 --> 01:02:35.728
he is planning to use the monorail
to escape the island.

01:02:35.811 --> 01:02:38.230
Don't just stand there,
we have to finish him!

01:02:40.065 --> 01:02:42.568

[Kong grunts]

01:03:18.729 --> 01:03:20.690
[Richard] What are you doing now, Botila?

01:03:20.773 --> 01:03:23.150
I am covering my audio sensors

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:27.071
in preparation
for your 99.9% probable tirade.

01:03:27.154 --> 01:03:30.408
Relax, I am perfectly calm.

01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:33.453
That... does not compute.

01:03:33.536 --> 01:03:37.039
I had hoped to take that filthy ape
down myself.

01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:43.003
However, a truly wise man knows when
it is time to bring in the big guns.

01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:45.715

[roars]

01:04:04.775 --> 01:04:05.943
[Richard] Hurry, Botila!

01:04:06.026 --> 01:04:07.945
I want to be front and center

01:04:08.028 --> 01:04:12.032
when the military finally shoots down
the King of the Apes.

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:14.118
[Richard chuckling]

[Kong grunting]

01:04:22.585 --> 01:04:24.169
[Botila] Interesting.

01:04:24.253 --> 01:04:28.340
It would appear that they will not
open fire for fear of hitting civilians.

01:04:28.423 --> 01:04:32.011
They will if Kong goes crazy enough.

01:04:32.094 --> 01:04:36.932
What say we push the overgrown ape
over the edge... literally?

01:04:37.016 --> 01:04:39.143
- [roaring in pain]
- [crowd screaming]

01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:40.853
Send it in now!

01:05:42.665 --> 01:05:43.999
[roaring]

01:05:46.001 --> 01:05:48.128
Time to end this!

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:52.132
No way will he be able to withstand
maximum strength for long.

01:05:52.216 --> 01:05:54.802
- [electricity crackling]
- [roaring]

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.518

01:06:25.290 --> 01:06:27.960
[Danny grunts] You really sure
I've had enough lessons?

01:06:28.043 --> 01:06:30.045
You'll be fine, Danny.

01:06:30.129 --> 01:06:31.922
When I give the word, veer clear,

01:06:32.006 --> 01:06:34.424
then activate the auto-pilot
right after I jump.

01:06:34.508 --> 01:06:36.510
Say what? Jump?

01:06:36.594 --> 01:06:39.096
- Kong! Listen to me, bro. You...
- [grunting]

01:06:39.179 --> 01:06:40.555
[Kong roars]

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:42.892
[exclaiming]

01:06:42.975 --> 01:06:44.184
Danny, get ready.

01:06:44.268 --> 01:06:45.978
- Now, go!
- Lukas!

01:06:53.485 --> 01:06:54.779
[roaring]

01:06:54.862 --> 01:06:56.446
Kong! Help me, bro!

01:06:57.197 --> 01:06:58.949
Bro!

01:06:59.033 --> 01:07:00.325
[Lukas grunts]

01:07:02.036 --> 01:07:03.037
[chuckles]

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.789
Thanks!
You had me worried there for a sec.

01:07:04.872 --> 01:07:08.375
That's good. Okay, now,
you need to put down the plane...

01:07:08.458 --> 01:07:11.170
- The plane, Kong...
- [Kong grunting]

01:07:11.253 --> 01:07:13.547
[roaring]

01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:16.258
No! Kong, I understand how you feel,

01:07:16.341 --> 01:07:19.303
but I know you really don't want
to hurt anyone.

01:07:19.386 --> 01:07:21.346
So put the plane down...

01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:22.890
[stutters] gently!

01:07:22.973 --> 01:07:24.099
[Kong grunts]

01:07:25.768 --> 01:07:27.687
That's good, bro! Very good.

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:29.063
Now, listen to me.

01:07:29.146 --> 01:07:31.982
Kong, you have to go to our secret place.

01:07:32.066 --> 01:07:33.150
Understand?

01:07:33.233 --> 01:07:34.777
[emphatically] Our secret place!

01:07:37.822 --> 01:07:39.114
Trust me.

01:07:40.407 --> 01:07:41.408
Trust me.

01:07:42.743 --> 01:07:44.745
I'll meet you at our secret place.

01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:45.996
Understand?

01:07:48.248 --> 01:07:50.292
- [electricity crackling]
- [Kong yelling]

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:52.586
Go! Now!

01:08:02.221 --> 01:08:03.430
You did this to Kong!

01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:06.600
You'll never be able to prove it.

01:08:06.684 --> 01:08:07.810
Get us out of here.

01:08:09.979 --> 01:08:12.481
Your hatred has destroyed everything...

01:08:14.483 --> 01:08:15.776
as always.

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:23.492
It will take weeks to assess
all the damage that savage did

01:08:23.575 --> 01:08:25.953
to the preserve and all my bionobots!

01:08:26.036 --> 01:08:29.874
True, but there is little doubt
it will amount to tens of millions.

01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:34.962
Commissioner, it's time that monster paid
for everything he's done!

01:08:35.045 --> 01:08:37.296
- [screeching]
- [Decker gasps]

01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:39.759
[clears throat] You better believe...

01:08:39.841 --> 01:08:43.095
Kong will be hunted down and destroyed.

01:08:46.265 --> 01:08:47.599
[sirens wailing]

01:08:54.273 --> 01:08:56.233
[Kong grunting softly]

01:09:01.029 --> 01:09:02.238
[roaring]

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:04.116
Easy, bro.

01:09:04.198 --> 01:09:06.410
- It's just your family.
- All of us.

01:09:06.493 --> 01:09:08.245
[grunts]

01:09:08.328 --> 01:09:10.997
[Chatter] Big boy! Bawk! Big trouble!

01:09:11.081 --> 01:09:13.000
[Kong sighing]

01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:17.587
<i>Chico,</i> I could put you over my knee...

01:09:17.671 --> 01:09:19.464
Well, if you wouldn't crush it...

01:09:19.548 --> 01:09:21.591
For the scare you gave me today.

01:09:21.675 --> 01:09:24.344
[Chatter] Ditto to that, bawk!
Ditto that, bawk!

01:09:24.428 --> 01:09:25.554
[Kong sighs]

01:09:25.636 --> 01:09:27.555
I know it wasn't your fault.

01:09:27.639 --> 01:09:30.434
It's that horrible collar
Richard put on you.

01:09:30.517 --> 01:09:32.937
Good news is,
we're out of range of Richard's remote,

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.189
so he can't keep hurting Kong.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:37.399
But we still need to figure out
how to get it off of him.

01:09:37.482 --> 01:09:38.483
I can do it.

01:09:38.567 --> 01:09:40.234
If Kong will give me a lift.

01:09:41.736 --> 01:09:43.447
[collar beeping]

01:09:43.529 --> 01:09:45.407
- [Kong grunts nervously]
- [Amy] There.

01:09:46.491 --> 01:09:49.286
It's really quite simple
once you know how.

01:09:49.368 --> 01:09:53.497
So, Lukas, where exactly
is this secret place you told us about?

01:09:53.582 --> 01:09:54.834
[chuckles]

01:09:54.917 --> 01:09:56.376
Right here.

01:09:57.127 --> 01:09:58.378
[humming]

01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:01.673
[Danny laughs]

01:10:01.756 --> 01:10:04.384
- Okay, that's totally...
- [Chatter] Awk-some!

01:10:04.468 --> 01:10:06.053
[Lukas laughs] Thanks to Kong's success,

01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:09.807
I was able to finance the last stage
of my childhood dream.

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:11.183
It renders the fort invisible,

01:10:11.266 --> 01:10:15.104
either just from the air, or,
as you just saw, from the ground, too.

01:10:15.813 --> 01:10:16.939
[chuckling]

01:10:17.022 --> 01:10:20.734
I always figured you boys were building
some kind of club house,

01:10:20.818 --> 01:10:23.612
but this tree house <i>es increíble.</i>

01:10:23.695 --> 01:10:25.823
Tree fortress is more like it.

01:10:25.906 --> 01:10:28.533
- [shouts] How about giving me the tour?
- [Kong grunts happily]

01:10:29.201 --> 01:10:32.496
So, pal, this place have room
for all of us?

01:10:32.579 --> 01:10:36.458
[chuckles] Look, I really appreciate
your help, all of you,

01:10:36.541 --> 01:10:38.585
but this is my problem.

01:10:38.668 --> 01:10:41.546
[scoffs] We are family. We stick together.

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:44.967
At least until we can find a way
to vindicate Kong.

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:46.176
[Kong hoots]

01:10:47.011 --> 01:10:48.220
Thanks, guys.

01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:51.723
One hundred seventeen million
ninety thousand, two...

01:10:51.806 --> 01:10:53.100
[Richard] I've heard enough!

01:10:53.893 --> 01:10:57.604
But I have not completed calculating
the total damage Kong has...

01:10:57.687 --> 01:11:01.025
Either shut your mouth
or I will shut you down.

01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:05.654
Bottom line, it will cost a fortune
to rebuild my facility.

01:11:05.737 --> 01:11:09.783
But more importantly,
I must replace my bionobots.

01:11:09.867 --> 01:11:13.787
We need the force and firepower
to finish off Kong.

01:11:13.871 --> 01:11:17.832
I am having trouble computing
why you are so calm.

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:20.710
Frankly, it makes my circuits "jumpy."

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:23.130
[circuits calibrating]

01:11:24.131 --> 01:11:27.801
The only logical deduction
is that you already have a plan

01:11:27.885 --> 01:11:30.512
for getting both the funds
and the firepower.

01:11:30.595 --> 01:11:34.224
With a little help from my brother.

01:11:34.308 --> 01:11:38.187
[Richard on monitor] <i>I strongly suggest
you surrender Kong to the authorities.</i>

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:39.854
[laughing]

01:11:39.939 --> 01:11:43.233
No problem, Richard.
Happy to do it, just as soon as you tell

01:11:43.317 --> 01:11:45.194
Police Commissioner Decker and the media

01:11:45.277 --> 01:11:48.530
that you used the control collar
to drive Kong mad!

01:11:48.613 --> 01:11:50.991
[laughs] <i>Don't be absurd, Lukas.</i>

01:11:51.075 --> 01:11:55.162
<i>No one will believe the esteemed
Dr. Richard Remy would do such a thing.</i>

01:11:55.245 --> 01:11:58.290
Well, if that's what you called to say,
then goodbye.

01:11:58.373 --> 01:12:01.543
<i>Fine, if you don't care
about your ligers anymore...</i>

01:12:01.626 --> 01:12:03.462
What? [stutters]
What about Lady and Lucky?

01:12:03.545 --> 01:12:08.133
<i>Thanks to Kong's vicious rampage,
their enclosure was destroyed,</i>

01:12:08.217 --> 01:12:11.095
<i>so your precious ligers
escaped the island.</i>

01:12:11.178 --> 01:12:13.555
- Where are they?
- I have no idea.

01:12:13.638 --> 01:12:17.184
You're the one who tracks animals
for a living, so do your job.

01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:19.478
Meanwhile, I've already spread the word

01:12:19.561 --> 01:12:22.772
that I am offering a reward
to anyone that finds them.

01:12:22.856 --> 01:12:24.441
I promise you, Richard,

01:12:24.524 --> 01:12:28.070
one day you will get
what's coming to you.

01:12:31.698 --> 01:12:34.326
- Well, what did <i>tu hermano</i> say?
- [Kong hoots]

01:12:34.409 --> 01:12:36.870
He said Lady and Lucky are missing.

01:12:36.954 --> 01:12:38.956
I know, bro, but we'll find them.

01:12:39.039 --> 01:12:41.708
Amy, the ligers are both
GPS-chipped, right?

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:43.961
Yes. I have the receiver
in my backpack.

01:12:44.044 --> 01:12:45.629
I smell a robotic rat.

01:12:45.712 --> 01:12:48.423
I checked on the cats
after Kong had already left the island,

01:12:48.507 --> 01:12:50.342
they were safely locked
in their temporary habitat.

01:12:50.425 --> 01:12:52.511
Yeah, I figured Richard was lying.

01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:55.097
You think he's using the ligers
to try and bait us into a trap?

01:12:55.180 --> 01:12:57.975
Yeah, but we still gotta save
Lucky and his mom, right?

01:12:58.058 --> 01:13:00.894
Don't worry, that's exactly what
Jonesy and I plan to do.

01:13:00.978 --> 01:13:02.479
[Kong grunting]

01:13:02.562 --> 01:13:05.524
No way, Kong, it's too dangerous.
You need...

01:13:05.607 --> 01:13:08.360
Save it, Lukas. Kong's made up his mind.
He's coming, too.

01:13:08.443 --> 01:13:11.863
[sighs] Kong is as <i>valiente</i>
as he is stubborn.

01:13:11.946 --> 01:13:15.284
- [Chatter] Stubborn <i>supremo!</i> Awk!
- I have their signal!

01:13:15.367 --> 01:13:18.287
Lucky and Lady are on the south side
of San Francisco.

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:21.623
[gasps] Lady's heart rate
is off the charts!

01:13:21.706 --> 01:13:23.375
She doesn't appear to be moving,

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:26.711
so she must be terrified
of something or someone.

01:13:26.795 --> 01:13:31.175
Okay, so how do you propose
we sneak a gigantic gorilla

01:13:31.258 --> 01:13:33.093
across a crowded city?

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.556
[Kong grunting]

01:13:37.639 --> 01:13:41.185
[laughing] This is the coolest ride ever!

01:13:41.268 --> 01:13:42.519
[Amy laughs nervously]

01:13:42.602 --> 01:13:47.274
Personally, I'm looking forward
to getting my feet back on terra firma.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:51.820
- [Kong grunts softly]
- [Lukas shushing] Quiet, Kong.

01:13:51.903 --> 01:13:54.906
He seems unusually nervous
for some reason.

01:13:54.989 --> 01:13:57.201
Duh, 'cause he never
learned how to swim.

01:13:57.284 --> 01:13:58.368
That's not true.

01:13:58.452 --> 01:14:01.288
We used to swim in the lake near our place
in the Redwoods all summer.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.248
[Kong snorts]

01:14:03.332 --> 01:14:04.374
Nuh-uh.

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:05.750
Kong says you were swimming,

01:14:05.834 --> 01:14:09.213
he was walking on the bottom,
the water barely came up to his waist.

01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.465
[Kong grunting]

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.716
- [alarm blaring]
- [Lukas] Hold it!

01:14:12.799 --> 01:14:14.301
- [horn continues blaring]
- [Danny] Duck!

01:14:15.302 --> 01:14:17.221
Everyone hide under the water!

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:22.892
[man] Hard to starboard!

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:26.813
Hmm, I don't remember any island here...

01:14:28.857 --> 01:14:31.276
[Amy] I'm certain the GPS is correct.

01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:32.902
But it doesn't make any sense.

01:14:32.986 --> 01:14:35.197
How could the ligers
even get in there?

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.866
All I know is,
their vitals are dangerously high.

01:14:37.949 --> 01:14:40.369
- We must find them before...
- [faint alarm ringing]

01:14:44.789 --> 01:14:46.875
Will you pathetic weaklings hurry?

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:49.253
Listen, lady, or whatever you are,

01:14:49.336 --> 01:14:52.339
we're not moving men,
we're professional poachers.

01:14:52.964 --> 01:14:56.885
Professional poachers,
an excellent example of an oxymoron.

01:14:56.968 --> 01:14:59.221
- What'd she just call us?
- Forget about it.

01:14:59.304 --> 01:15:02.849
Your boss didn't tell us
we'd be robbing a military warehouse.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:04.559
- I don't like it.
- Yeah.

01:15:04.643 --> 01:15:08.272
We get caught, and it's the rest
of our lives behind bars.

01:15:12.234 --> 01:15:15.445
You two are not the ones that will be
apprehended tonight.

01:15:15.529 --> 01:15:17.364
Here is your payment.

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:19.949
The two ligers, as promised.

01:15:20.033 --> 01:15:22.202
- [gasps] There they are!
- Easy, Danny!

01:15:22.286 --> 01:15:24.121
- We don't want them to see...
- [Kong grunts]

01:15:24.204 --> 01:15:26.665
[Kong roaring]

01:15:26.748 --> 01:15:28.833
- [Brag] Holy...
- It's that monster ape from the news!

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.630
[Kong growling]

01:15:37.634 --> 01:15:39.344
[roaring]

01:15:41.638 --> 01:15:44.724
[Brag] Hey, you can't just leave us
here alone with that monster.

01:15:44.808 --> 01:15:46.893
You won't be for long.

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:49.979
We have a little surprise
for Kong and his allies.

01:15:50.063 --> 01:15:51.190
- What?
- Why?

01:15:52.899 --> 01:15:54.193
[both exclaim]

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.988
- [screeching]
- [growling]

01:15:59.072 --> 01:16:00.449
[Kong roaring]

01:16:01.408 --> 01:16:04.494
[Botila] Everything has gone
exactly as planned.

01:16:04.578 --> 01:16:05.829
For once.

01:16:05.912 --> 01:16:11.125
Indeed. The stolen weapons
will net a fortune on the black market.

01:16:11.210 --> 01:16:12.627
What about the laser cannon?

01:16:12.711 --> 01:16:15.214
<i>Already installed and ready to go.</i>

01:16:15.297 --> 01:16:16.715
- [roaring]
- [screeching]

01:16:26.766 --> 01:16:31.188
Internal note,
reevaluate giant ape's capabilities.

01:16:47.912 --> 01:16:48.997
[both screaming]

01:16:55.254 --> 01:16:57.130
[thudding]

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:10.727
[Wheeler] Forget the cats,
let's get out of here!

01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:18.360
[Brag] What is it with us and apes?

01:17:18.443 --> 01:17:19.903
[panting] Hey, Wheeler,

01:17:19.986 --> 01:17:22.155
you don't think that giant could be
the baby we...

01:17:22.239 --> 01:17:24.073
Yeah, I bet, 'cause look there!

01:17:24.157 --> 01:17:26.743
He looks just like the guy
who stole from us!

01:17:26.826 --> 01:17:29.371
He was just a kid,
but I'm sure that's the one!

01:17:29.454 --> 01:17:33.542
I swore one day I'd get even with you,
and that goes double now!

01:17:53.895 --> 01:17:55.730
[rumbling]

01:17:56.898 --> 01:17:58.149
Look out!

01:17:58.858 --> 01:17:59.859
Ahhh!

01:18:03.822 --> 01:18:05.324
[Jonesy] It set off the detonation timer!

01:18:05.407 --> 01:18:06.533
[timer beeping]

01:18:07.409 --> 01:18:08.952
Let's do this before
the whole place blows!

01:18:14.291 --> 01:18:15.875
T-Rex is gonna crush Kong!

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:18.712
No, it's leaving!

01:18:18.795 --> 01:18:20.839
- [Kong groaning]
- [Danny] I don't get it.

01:18:21.965 --> 01:18:24.175
- [planes humming]
- [Danny] Now, I do.

01:18:24.258 --> 01:18:25.802
It's the Army!

01:18:28.096 --> 01:18:29.514
[gunships firing]

01:18:35.937 --> 01:18:37.689
We need to kill those lights!

01:18:37.772 --> 01:18:40.024
Pitch your fastball, Kong!
Aim for the lights!

01:18:48.408 --> 01:18:50.118
Okay, just one more!

01:18:50.201 --> 01:18:52.787
[Jonesy] No time! The bomb's gonna blow!

01:18:54.581 --> 01:18:56.916
Kong! Lady!

01:18:59.252 --> 01:19:02.464
[Lukas] This way, guys! Come on! Run!

01:19:05.925 --> 01:19:07.719
[explosion rumbling]

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:09.929
[both] Ahhh!

01:19:14.393 --> 01:19:16.310
[gasps] Where are they?

01:19:24.861 --> 01:19:26.112
[roaring]

01:19:28.239 --> 01:19:31.618
[sighs] They're okay!
Kong has Lady!

01:19:31.701 --> 01:19:35.747
Good job, Kong!
Now get us out of here, bro.

01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:39.376
<i>Footage taken from Army aircraft
this evening clearly proves</i>

01:19:39.459 --> 01:19:42.086
<i>that the giant ape known as Kong
is responsible</i>

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:46.800
<i>for stealing an entire stockpile
of military grade weapons,</i>

01:19:46.883 --> 01:19:49.636
with the help of his radical master,
Lukas Remy.

01:19:49.719 --> 01:19:51.262
[footsteps thudding]

01:19:52.556 --> 01:19:55.099
Oh, thank goodness
you are all right!

01:19:55.183 --> 01:19:57.268
We were just watching you
on the news.

01:19:57.351 --> 01:19:58.812
[Chatter] Bad news! Bawk!

01:19:58.895 --> 01:20:02.607
Looks like your brother did a great job
of framing Kong for the heist tonight.

01:20:02.691 --> 01:20:07.028
And his own <i>hermano.</i>
Not just Kong and Lukas, you, too.

01:20:07.654 --> 01:20:09.238
[Danny] Hey, count me in!

01:20:09.322 --> 01:20:11.115
Looks we're all fugitives now.

01:20:11.199 --> 01:20:12.742
Except Anita and my sis.

01:20:12.826 --> 01:20:17.205
I'm certain they'll be trying to find us,
too, since we all work together.

01:20:17.288 --> 01:20:19.833
[reporter on monitor] <i>The public outcry
is loud and clear...</i>

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.375
<i>capture these criminals.</i>

01:20:21.460 --> 01:20:23.837
<i>Hunt down and destroy Kong!</i>

01:20:25.296 --> 01:20:28.675
[Richard] My buyer is paying
a fortune for these.

01:20:28.758 --> 01:20:31.428
Enough that I can add
built-in weapons systems

01:20:31.511 --> 01:20:34.681
in all my new and improved bionobots.

01:20:34.764 --> 01:20:36.975
Maybe I'll even upgrade you.

01:20:37.058 --> 01:20:39.728
I am already state-of-the-art.

01:20:40.979 --> 01:20:42.731
- I am not.
- [metal whirring]

01:20:42.814 --> 01:20:47.652
My father didn't believe in using science
to make one man superior to another.

01:20:47.736 --> 01:20:49.237
I do.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:52.073
Once I'm finished upgrading myself,

01:20:52.156 --> 01:20:57.537
I will be the most powerful
bionoman on Earth.

01:20:57.621 --> 01:21:00.665
[Lukas] Now that we've seen the kinds
of weapons Kong may be up against,

01:21:00.749 --> 01:21:04.252
I think we'd better start working on some
armored bands, so he can deflect them.

01:21:04.335 --> 01:21:07.714
Yeah!
Or even better, bat 'em back to sender!

01:21:07.797 --> 01:21:09.215
[Kong grunts nervously]

01:21:09.298 --> 01:21:11.551
[laughs] Don't worry, I'll teach you.

01:21:11.635 --> 01:21:14.053
Looks like we're gonna be
on the defense for a while.

01:21:14.137 --> 01:21:16.014
[Chatter] Bawk! Go, team!

01:21:16.097 --> 01:21:18.892
At least until we can figure out
a way to clear our names

01:21:18.975 --> 01:21:20.935
and prove Kong is innocent.

01:21:23.855 --> 01:21:25.106
Hey, yo, Lucky!

01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:26.983
How you doing, little guy?

01:21:27.066 --> 01:21:29.653
Hey, where's his mom? Where's Lady?

01:21:32.196 --> 01:21:33.865
After everything Lady had been through...

01:21:33.948 --> 01:21:37.118
[stammers] her heart just couldn't...

01:21:37.201 --> 01:21:39.370
[Danny] Oh, no. She's gone?

01:21:41.455 --> 01:21:43.166
[Kong grunts softly]

01:21:45.293 --> 01:21:46.961
[Kong grunting]

01:21:47.045 --> 01:21:51.090
If only the rest of the world
could see how gentle he is.

01:21:51.174 --> 01:21:54.969
Unfortunately, my brother has
turned this into a war.

01:21:55.053 --> 01:21:56.888
And it's just begun.

01:22:08.107 --> 01:22:10.151
