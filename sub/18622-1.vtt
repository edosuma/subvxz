02:42.245 --> 02:44.071
Speech! Speech!

02:44.413 --> 02:47.617
No, no. I ain't
gonna make no speech.

02:47.834 --> 02:52.246
I want to thank you bums
for this wonderful birthday.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.001
One thing I learned
when I first started out...

02:55.216 --> 02:58.300
...a man who ain't got friends
stays poor...

02:58.511 --> 03:00.587
...until he goes out and buys good ones.

03:00.763 --> 03:05.010
Me, I got the best.

03:06.561 --> 03:11.057
Sheriff Glick! Stand up.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.313
Deputy Sheriff Potts!

03:13.526 --> 03:16.313
Guy Gisborne!

03:16.612 --> 03:20.444
All the rest of you mugs!
Wonderful pals!

03:21.033 --> 03:23.785
Friends who would go out
and cut a right arm off for me.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.622
All I gotta tell them, who.

03:26.789 --> 03:32.032
The reason I got such loyal
friends is because I'm thoughtful.

03:32.211 --> 03:36.209
I never asked nobody
to work on a holiday.

03:37.258 --> 03:41.920
Thanksgiving, New Y ear's,
Christmas, Fourth of July.

03:42.972 --> 03:47.184
Only one time I asked,
one Saint Valentine's Day...

03:48.019 --> 03:49.430
...a little cleanup job.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.108
I just want to thank
all you mugs again.

03:57.695 --> 04:02.653
Only thing I'm sorry is that
my good pal Robbo ain't here...

04:02.825 --> 04:05.447
...from New Orleans
where he's taking in the races.

04:06.871 --> 04:10.738
Well, that's all I've
got to say for now.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.494
Now everybody get drunk.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.995
Wait a minute!
Before you all get drunk.

04:17.214 --> 04:20.666
A toast to Big Jim.
Come on, let's hear it.

04:20.885 --> 04:24.930
- To Big Jim!
- Happy Birthday, Big Jim!

04:32.188 --> 04:35.639
Big Jim was a shmendrik.
He was no good.

04:35.816 --> 04:37.939
The man was tight,
he don't part with a dime.

04:38.110 --> 04:39.937
And besides, he was a slob.

04:40.112 --> 04:43.279
And on top of everything else,
he wasn't an American citizen.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.367
Things are different from here on in
in Chicago now.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.287
Let me give you the
benefit of my thinking.

04:50.456 --> 04:54.324
No more independent operations.
Forget them.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.830
We're putting them together.

04:56.003 --> 04:59.004
We're gonna merge them up
into one organization.

04:59.173 --> 05:01.960
There's gonna be just one big leader.

05:02.510 --> 05:06.508
Is there anybody
here that got any ideas...

05:06.681 --> 05:09.432
...who's gonna be the new leader?

05:13.104 --> 05:15.180
Tomatoes.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.227
How about picking
names out of a hat?

05:18.818 --> 05:21.819
We're gonna use your hat.

05:22.029 --> 05:25.861
Soon you're gonna have
nothing to wear it on.

05:26.367 --> 05:30.946
- May I make a suggestion?
- It's a democratic meeting. Yes.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.536
Thank you. Gentlemen...

05:33.749 --> 05:36.834
...as sheriff, I have to
keep law and order here.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.712
Now under Big Jim, it was
hard with everyone fighting.

05:41.924 --> 05:45.424
We don't want another mess
like Big Jim here.

05:45.636 --> 05:49.052
The crime commission's stronger.
People are fed up.

05:49.223 --> 05:53.055
We need a leader with courage,
strength, integrity.

05:53.227 --> 05:58.566
There's only one man who
fills that description: Guy Gisborne.

06:00.109 --> 06:01.817
I accept the nomination.

06:02.570 --> 06:06.983
Is there any objections before
the nominations is closed?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.824
You got something to say?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.576
I motion somebody open a window.

06:14.749 --> 06:19.576
Somebody open a window.
That's the stockyard side.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.256
Being a democratic meeting...

06:23.424 --> 06:25.880
...I motion that the
nominations is closed.

06:26.093 --> 06:28.881
I'm the only candidate,
so I'm the new leader.

06:29.096 --> 06:33.593
So I'm gonna thank you
for the whole thing. Next business.

06:33.809 --> 06:38.353
- What about Robbo?
- He joins like everyone else.

06:38.564 --> 06:42.479
He ain't gonna like it
somebody killed his pal.

06:42.693 --> 06:46.145
Robbo is in or he's under.

06:47.532 --> 06:51.695
You guys are gonna run
things just like always.

06:51.911 --> 06:54.616
Except now you're
getting protection.

06:54.789 --> 06:58.454
You're gonna get
City Hall protection.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.333
That's beautiful.
Of course, you have to pay a small...

07:02.547 --> 07:06.627
...service charge that's based
on a percentage of your take.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.959
- Soupmeat?
- How much service charge, boss?

07:11.514 --> 07:15.013
- I'm making it 50%.
- Fifty percent!

07:16.018 --> 07:17.299
Hatrack, what do you got?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.307
Couldn't we get less service?

07:20.815 --> 07:25.026
You can get less service.
But you're still paying 50%.

07:27.321 --> 07:31.817
If anyone has a problem,
I got a special complaint box.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.988
I can put your whole body in there.

07:35.162 --> 07:36.407
I still say-

07:36.622 --> 07:38.414
Forget Robbo!

07:38.624 --> 07:42.373
Don't tell me about Robbo!
What's the matter?

07:42.587 --> 07:47.165
You think you get protection
for free? That's not a gift.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.717
What do you think it costs?
Tell him.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.089
I'd rather not be involved.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.472
He don't want to be involved.

07:56.684 --> 08:01.013
You're in for 25%.
You're involved pretty good.

08:01.230 --> 08:05.310
Sure, 50% is high.
But he's grabbing 25.

08:05.526 --> 08:06.855
I don't like it either.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.519
I can't do it for less.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.945
Well, scratch a few cousins.

08:12.158 --> 08:13.533
I'm scratching nothing.

08:13.701 --> 08:16.406
My hands is tied.
I'm locked in.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.615
So, gentlemen, let me say this.

08:19.832 --> 08:24.126
Let me nominate the 50%
service charge as official.

08:24.712 --> 08:29.173
Is there any objections?
All right. Now, listen to me.

08:29.383 --> 08:32.087
This is the best thing for us.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.553
Now we're all together,
we're organized.

08:35.765 --> 08:40.474
We're...
If I could find the word...

08:40.686 --> 08:43.058
We're all for one.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.629
Pals!

10:01.142 --> 10:05.187
One thing, boss.
Exactly what are we gonna get?

10:06.147 --> 10:07.226
Nothing.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.696
Easy. Now just take it easy.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.818
How are you, Robbo?
What are you doing here?

10:20.995 --> 10:25.408
I thought you were down
in New Orleans doing well.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.866
- Who hit Big Jim?
- Hit who?

10:29.003 --> 10:32.668
- Him.
- You're looking good.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.794
Give the man a seat, get up!

10:36.928 --> 10:38.338
All right, who hit him?

10:39.513 --> 10:43.214
What's the difference?
Forget about it.

10:43.434 --> 10:44.845
Who was the brain?

10:45.061 --> 10:48.679
There were 34 killings
in the last two months.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.312
This town has had it.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.020
You answered my question.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.355
He had to go for the good of us all.

10:56.531 --> 11:00.279
You take that badge off,
you won't live to put it back.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.908
We've got a new setup.
There's no more independence.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.163
We merged into one organization.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.709
The boys made me their new leader.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.925
Looks like the day they fixed
the power in the death house.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.885
We're still gonna hustle...

11:23.057 --> 11:25.548
...now we're protected from the top.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.719
Fifty percent of the take.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.721
What it is-
When they started the United States...

11:31.941 --> 11:34.693
...they put the states in one union.

11:34.902 --> 11:37.689
And I'm like the first president.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.901
Give my regards to Martha.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.618
Robbo, you better think it over.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.119
I'll give it to you
straight, Mr. President.

11:50.334 --> 11:52.327
You stay out of the north side.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.795
You come like George Washington,
I'll send you back like Lincoln.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.424
Like Lincoln.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.387
Excuse me.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.765
I want to throw in a few words...

12:16.986 --> 12:21.981
...about our friend
that departed so suddenly.

12:27.914 --> 12:32.955
Now, I know Big Jim a long time,
and I want to say this.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.576
He did not have enemies.

12:35.796 --> 12:40.090
He had a lot of friends that didn't
like him but you can't please everybody.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.797
There was people calling him...

12:42.970 --> 12:47.431
...a fink, a chiseler,
a crooked hood.

12:47.642 --> 12:51.935
There was people that didn't
have nothing good to say.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.103
But I can tell you this.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.482
Big Jim had a- He was...

12:57.860 --> 13:00.316
...a very good dresser.

13:00.529 --> 13:04.444
I mean he looked mean
on the outside, but inside...

13:04.659 --> 13:08.193
Well, inside his closet
he had 280 suits.

13:09.747 --> 13:12.831
Now I want to introduce Robbo.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.792
Here's a man that...

13:15.002 --> 13:18.834
...was very close to
Big Jim in the past...

13:19.006 --> 13:23.964
...and he might even be
closer to him in the future.

13:31.644 --> 13:36.935
Well, all I want to say is Big Jim
has gone to meet the big G.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.020
Big Jim was an inspiration to me.

13:43.197 --> 13:47.693
When I was a kid, he caught me
stealing hubcaps off his car.

13:47.910 --> 13:52.656
He said, "Don't steal the
hubcaps. Steal the whole car. "

13:56.669 --> 14:00.168
Well, we're gonna miss you, Big Jim.

14:01.424 --> 14:05.635
There won't be a guy like
you around for a long time.

15:11.661 --> 15:14.697
I think she come to the wrong stash.

15:14.914 --> 15:19.659
- We should say something.
- It ain't none of our business.

15:31.305 --> 15:36.216
I think it was disrespectful.
What do you think, boss?

15:36.435 --> 15:39.769
- She's a good-looking dame.
- A relative?

15:40.815 --> 15:44.148
Big Jim never had
no relatives, only a brother.

15:44.569 --> 15:49.195
That dame ain't
nobody's brother. Come on.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.498
Relax with the horn.
Park it and wait.

16:05.673 --> 16:09.172
There's people trying
to sleep. Let's go.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.721
- Have a good time?
- Yes.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.355
I'm surprised.
They water the liquor here.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.851
- I want to see Robbo.
- Ain't in yet.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.312
Open up. I'll wait for him.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.703
- What'll you have?
- Nothing.

16:43.878 --> 16:47.247
That guy shooting pool is waiting too.

16:48.216 --> 16:52.427
- Who is he?
- I'm not sure.

16:54.972 --> 16:58.176
He's not a threat
with the cue stick.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.561
You play with the other end.

17:07.777 --> 17:12.902
I thought I recognized a friend.
I just blew in from Indiana.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.901
Let me give you some advice.

17:15.117 --> 17:19.743
Don't stop for a drink.
The bartender's my boyfriend.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.584
All I had in mind
was a game of pool.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.665
How come you're chalking your finger?

17:30.258 --> 17:32.630
For short shots.

17:37.932 --> 17:42.012
By the way, where's
the boss-man tonight?

17:42.228 --> 17:44.600
I don't know who you're talking about.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.736
I told you to stay
out of the north side.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.625
I'm trying to get
the record straight.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.452
You're right about the sheriff.

18:08.671 --> 18:12.122
He was behind it.
I was thinking...

18:12.300 --> 18:16.297
...we could make an arrangement
for you to join.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.344
- We do our own laundry.
- If there's an extra bundle...

18:20.558 --> 18:23.891
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.472
Give him a drink
and get out of here.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.815
Look at the way he's treating me.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.024
We ain't in-betweeners.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.811
We're either
best friends or enemies.

18:36.032 --> 18:40.279
- Why don't we be best friends?
- Your drink's waiting.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.000
It's too bad.
He has so much to live for.

18:50.338 --> 18:52.959
- You're blocking my way.
- Take a detour.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.163
I don't take detours.

18:54.425 --> 18:58.470
A little respect, or your friends
will carry you in a box.

18:58.679 --> 19:01.514
- Let me hit him, Robbo.
- Robbo?

19:01.724 --> 19:04.393
If you shot pool with your tongue,
you'd be good.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.437
I can't stand the taste of chalk.

19:07.647 --> 19:12.854
- Who are you?
- A bird lover who studies pigeons.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.688
You don't mean real pigeons.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.817
- No.
- Name your game.

19:19.033 --> 19:22.367
- It's your table.
- How about a hundred a ball?

19:22.578 --> 19:25.365
A hundred a ball?
I don't carry hundreds.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.616
How about a thousand?

19:27.833 --> 19:30.870
Knock off the lights, Will.
Rack them up.

19:33.297 --> 19:34.626
Give me a stick.

19:36.050 --> 19:40.712
Seven ways a game at
a thousand a way, 7000.

19:42.598 --> 19:46.845
How about goosing up the action
a little? A little side bet?

19:47.061 --> 19:50.228
- What kind?
- Oh, about 25 grand.

19:50.398 --> 19:53.268
All right. That's 32.

19:53.484 --> 19:57.233
You're a stranger.
You pick the stake holder.

20:02.910 --> 20:07.074
I noticed you've got
an honest face, baby.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.375
Let's see how good you can lag that.

20:29.604 --> 20:32.225
Pretty good. It's your break.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.064
Nothing.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.796
Excuse me.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.999
I bow to a mechanic.

22:59.212 --> 23:02.580
Your cushions are tired,
threw me off my game.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.666
Too bad. Pay him.

23:07.428 --> 23:11.757
I like a bank with
strong assets, baby.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.724
- Thank you.
- Sure.

23:14.685 --> 23:17.437
- What's your racket?
- I'm a brain surgeon.

23:18.356 --> 23:20.099
Follow me.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.033
- Your knitting.
- Oh, sorry.

23:33.246 --> 23:34.953
Lock it up.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.791
You a drinking man?

23:39.627 --> 23:41.121
Anytime.

23:42.213 --> 23:43.755
Help yourself.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.998
What's your name?

23:47.718 --> 23:48.833
Little John.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.469
- You know him?
- Used to work in Indiana?

23:52.640 --> 23:54.467
- Yeah.
- Like what?

23:54.684 --> 23:58.634
Beer, alky, dice. Nothing big.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.146
Why you in Chicago?

24:01.357 --> 24:03.895
Looking for new connections.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.649
- Try Gisborne?
- Nope.

24:07.321 --> 24:08.602
Why not?

24:08.823 --> 24:10.483
Crooked hood.

24:12.618 --> 24:16.450
This town is down to two slices:
him and me.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.822
I know all about it.

24:20.084 --> 24:24.082
He's organized. He's got 85 guns,
plus the sheriff.

24:24.297 --> 24:25.755
We're an even dozen...

24:25.965 --> 24:29.666
...if you include a hooker
who used to throw knives.

24:29.927 --> 24:32.928
You like the long shots.
Want to jump in?

24:34.724 --> 24:36.348
I'm in.

24:37.310 --> 24:39.682
Let me give you the bad news first.

24:39.895 --> 24:43.181
Gisborne's gonna hit,
and he's gonna hit fast.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.360
I don't know where. I have no idea.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.358
He can knock over everything at once.

24:51.574 --> 24:54.361
You ever think of knocking first?

24:54.577 --> 24:57.115
This guy don't hear so good.

24:57.330 --> 25:02.241
Eighty-five guns, he can knock
seven times harder than we can.

25:02.543 --> 25:06.375
- What's his pride and joy?
- A gambling joint.

25:09.383 --> 25:12.053
Last thing Gisborne
expects is a visit.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.301
That's a good reason
for paying a visit.

25:15.973 --> 25:20.552
That's not a bad idea.
We're gonna get it anyway.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.387
I was hoping we'd have help.

25:24.232 --> 25:27.980
You could also lose a few more guns.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.899
When your opponent's
got all the aces...

25:31.113 --> 25:34.399
...there's only one thing
to do: kick over the table.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.751
- What would you like?
- Nothing.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.796
Well, in my opinion-

25:56.013 --> 26:00.971
Drink your cocoa. There's
only one way to handle this thing.

26:01.185 --> 26:05.349
We pick 10 of the
best soldiers to kill Robbo.

26:05.565 --> 26:09.265
If they miss, we'll have a war.
This city won't go for it.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.353
How do we get rid of them?

26:11.571 --> 26:13.444
Give them the flu?

26:13.656 --> 26:14.984
- Break them.
- I will.

26:15.199 --> 26:16.991
Knock over his club.

26:17.201 --> 26:20.238
- He builds another.
- Knock it over.

26:20.454 --> 26:21.865
He'll be dry soon.

26:22.081 --> 26:24.239
Listen to this.

26:24.458 --> 26:28.456
Suppose he pays
me a visit over here.

26:28.671 --> 26:32.005
I got a quarter million
dollars tied up here.

26:32.216 --> 26:34.790
He'd have to be out of his skull.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.597
You better be right.

26:41.809 --> 26:45.059
I know I'm right.
I'd bet my life on it.

26:47.982 --> 26:50.651
You got a bet.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.163
All right, let's go.
Load up. Load up.

27:10.505 --> 27:12.248
All right, load up.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.210
Come on, move.

27:16.552 --> 27:19.257
Get your morning paper!

27:19.722 --> 27:22.509
Get your morning paper!

27:31.150 --> 27:34.519
Hey, that Gisborne over there?

27:35.446 --> 27:37.355
Yeah, it sure is.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.443
Ain't that Robbo over there?

27:43.663 --> 27:46.450
- It sure is.
- Where's he headed?

27:46.666 --> 27:50.746
Wherever it is, he's in
for a surprise when he returns.

27:51.379 --> 27:52.624
Where's he headed?

27:52.838 --> 27:56.539
Wherever it is, he's in
for a surprise when he returns.

28:18.281 --> 28:19.905
- Blue Jaw.
- Yeah, boss?

28:20.074 --> 28:23.110
- Itsy-bitsy pieces.
- Gotcha, boss.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.291
Out of the way, will ya?

28:49.770 --> 28:55.109
Oh, that's music. That's beautiful.
That's my favorite tune, eh.

29:10.583 --> 29:14.628
Oh, that's gorgeous.
Play that thing there, eh.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.209
Congratulations, you did good.

29:34.273 --> 29:38.141
Folks, this joint is now
closed for new alterations.

29:38.361 --> 29:43.188
Leave quietly and no one gets hurt.
Guys, have a good time.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.057
Hey, Will, I thought we was friends.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.229
We are. What are you worried about?

30:15.439 --> 30:17.895
I never miss anything I aim at.

30:18.109 --> 30:21.026
You came awful close.
You made me nervous.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.238
I didn't mean to make you nervous.

30:24.448 --> 30:28.114
Take a rest so you won't be nervous.
I'll take over.

30:28.327 --> 30:33.036
I appreciate that, thanks very much.
I don't feel good, my health...

34:40.538 --> 34:43.989
Hundred thousand hangovers
down the drain.

34:44.333 --> 34:47.204
I had the same thought exactly.

34:47.712 --> 34:52.539
Seventy-five feet by 82 feet.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.174
Let's see. That's not important.

34:56.637 --> 35:01.383
I have been a builder for 38 years,
but this is a new one on me.

35:01.601 --> 35:05.135
All we want is a club
that's 100% knock-proof.

35:05.312 --> 35:09.441
This is it.
If anyone can ever build it.

35:09.650 --> 35:11.857
You're the guy who'll do it.

35:12.069 --> 35:16.114
I better give you an idea
of what this will cost:

35:16.324 --> 35:20.322
- Close to 400,000.
- All right, start working.

35:21.746 --> 35:25.993
- Don't you want a competitive bid?
- You don't get the idea.

35:26.167 --> 35:29.287
It's secret.
We're talking to one builder.

35:29.503 --> 35:33.453
That builder ain't talking
to nobody, not even his crew.

35:33.674 --> 35:37.125
- They must look at blueprints.
- They look at nothing!

35:37.345 --> 35:41.841
Break it up so one guy don't know
what the other guy is doing.

35:42.767 --> 35:45.258
- Yes, sir.
- How long will it take?

35:45.478 --> 35:47.885
- Maybe six, seven months?
- Three.

35:48.105 --> 35:51.688
- But that's impossible-
- Three.

35:52.443 --> 35:54.732
- It's possible.
- Possible.

35:56.364 --> 36:00.657
- Hey, boss. Phone's ringing.
- Well, answer it.

36:00.868 --> 36:04.652
Why do they always ask me
to answer the phone?

36:04.872 --> 36:08.537
Everything all broken up here anyway.

36:08.751 --> 36:13.709
I don't even know where it is.
How can I answer the phone?

36:13.881 --> 36:18.709
If there's no phone, I'm leaving.
There's ringing, must be a phone.

36:18.886 --> 36:22.220
You keep ringing, baby.
I'm gonna find you.

36:24.308 --> 36:28.223
Where there's a wire,
there's gotta be a phone.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.606
Just get out.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.683
I done found it, boss.

36:38.739 --> 36:40.234
Hello?

36:43.244 --> 36:45.402
Guess who? It's Gisborne.

36:48.416 --> 36:53.327
- Three months.
- Three months is hardly time.

36:53.546 --> 36:56.713
I'm not a magician.
This is a big job-

36:56.924 --> 37:00.091
We'll split the difference.
Two months!

37:00.261 --> 37:01.755
Two?

37:01.971 --> 37:07.012
- Why do you want to argue?
- Me, argue? That's ridiculous.

37:07.226 --> 37:10.180
- Hello?
- What do you say, Robbo?

37:10.396 --> 37:14.394
- What's new, kid?
- Nothing much. What's new with you?

37:14.775 --> 37:18.643
Nothing much. I'm sorry
I wasn't here when you called.

37:18.863 --> 37:21.864
That's okay.
As long as you got my message.

37:22.074 --> 37:26.119
I got the message, believe me.
I got it pretty good.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.612
What are you going to do now?

37:28.831 --> 37:32.165
- You gonna build a new joint?
- Starting tomorrow.

37:32.376 --> 37:36.208
Don't use so many nails.
It's hard to take apart.

37:36.589 --> 37:40.634
- All right, pal, what's on your mind?
- I'll tell you.

37:40.802 --> 37:44.799
I've been thinking.
Why are we killing one another for?

37:44.972 --> 37:47.843
We're both starting from scratch.

37:48.059 --> 37:51.641
Why don't we build a joint together?
Be partners.

37:53.147 --> 37:58.308
I'd rather keep you as an enemy.
As long as I hate you, I've got taste.

37:59.278 --> 38:03.406
This guy's a funny bum, this guy.
Why you being stupid?

38:03.616 --> 38:07.316
I got you seven to one,
not even horse-betting odds.

38:07.495 --> 38:09.238
I'll improve the odds.

38:09.455 --> 38:12.789
Maybe you won't live that long.
That's a promise.

38:13.000 --> 38:16.619
You never kept a promise
in your life, you bum.

38:17.463 --> 38:20.713
- What's he pushing?
- He wants to be partners.

38:20.925 --> 38:22.882
How come he's so friendly?

38:23.094 --> 38:26.427
There's been a lot of heat
since they hit Big Jim.

38:26.639 --> 38:30.506
He figures he'll see action here,
so he's being chummy.

38:30.727 --> 38:36.017
That's nice. I'm going to put out
a good deal of money on this...

38:36.190 --> 38:40.354
...and you have certain
occupational hazards...

38:40.528 --> 38:42.520
Give him 50 G as a deposit.

38:42.738 --> 38:46.404
Tell the help they're on salary
and we'll open soon.

38:46.617 --> 38:49.903
- Get cleaned up, you look like a bum.
- Sorry.

38:50.121 --> 38:54.582
Hey, architect, you got two months.
You begin tomorrow.

39:05.136 --> 39:09.513
Look at that candy store.
Ricks, you count to 50.

39:12.685 --> 39:16.303
- How do you do, miss?
- How do you do, Robbo?

39:16.981 --> 39:19.187
- You know my name?
- Quite well.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.018
I'm Little John.
Didn't we meet at the polo matches?

39:23.237 --> 39:27.235
- Do you have a place we can be alone?
- Do I have a place-?

39:27.450 --> 39:28.992
- Down, boy.
- But-

39:29.201 --> 39:34.362
Handle your financial transaction.
I have a place we can be alone, Miss-

39:34.582 --> 39:38.580
- Please, call me Marian.
- Marian. Fine.

39:40.004 --> 39:43.752
Excuse us. We had some
untidy callers last night.

39:47.553 --> 39:51.385
- Where'd he dig that up?
- At the cemetery.

39:53.142 --> 39:56.725
The upstairs maid couldn't
get to this one either.

39:56.937 --> 40:00.223
- So I see.
- How about a chair?

40:00.441 --> 40:01.900
Thank you.

40:04.946 --> 40:08.528
- I shouldn't keep you in suspense.
- It's all right.

40:08.741 --> 40:10.615
I'm enjoying the view.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.692
My name is Marian Stevens.

40:15.915 --> 40:19.200
- Don't ring no bell with me.
- It will.

40:20.336 --> 40:24.120
- What were you doing at the funeral?
- Same as you.

40:24.340 --> 40:28.124
- But I was saying goodbye to Big Jim.
- So was I.

40:28.344 --> 40:32.508
- You mean, you knew him?
- Big Jim was my father.

40:33.891 --> 40:38.138
I was like a son to him.
He said nothing about a daughter.

40:38.354 --> 40:40.975
Then you weren't quite like a son.

40:42.567 --> 40:47.442
- Where you been all these years?
- Foxcroft, Vassar, the Sorbonne.

40:47.655 --> 40:49.648
Private schools.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.903
I don't recognize them
unless they got a PS in front of them.

40:54.120 --> 40:57.121
- You want a little drink?
- No, thank you.

40:57.331 --> 41:00.747
Mother died when I was born.
For obvious reasons...

41:00.960 --> 41:03.533
...Father kept me out of his world.

41:03.754 --> 41:06.328
Stevens was my mother's maiden name.

41:06.507 --> 41:09.674
- Sure you don't want a drink?
- No, thank you.

41:10.511 --> 41:15.636
- I liked Big Jim. He was some guy.
- He was very fond of you.

41:15.850 --> 41:18.637
What can I do for you?
Money? Contacts?

41:18.853 --> 41:20.133
There is something.

41:20.354 --> 41:23.640
Let's go to Blackstone.
We'll eat, we'll talk.

41:23.858 --> 41:27.642
No, I want to discuss it here, now.

41:30.031 --> 41:34.693
- Well, what's on your mind?
- I want my father's death avenged.

41:36.537 --> 41:39.704
You mean, you want me
to sue somebody?

41:39.916 --> 41:43.249
I want you to get the man
who killed my father.

41:43.461 --> 41:48.668
Classy-looking dame like you shouldn't
be making statements like that.

41:48.883 --> 41:53.212
- I'll pay you 25,000.
- Hold it. Wait a minute. Whoa.

41:54.055 --> 41:56.806
I run a gambling joint.
I hustle beer.

41:57.016 --> 41:59.851
I make people happy, not croak them.

42:00.061 --> 42:02.100
Thirty-five thousand.

42:03.397 --> 42:05.390
How about a little drink?

42:05.566 --> 42:09.564
You're upset about your old man.
I respect you for it.

42:09.737 --> 42:13.237
But shop for a killer?
It's walking in the jungle.

42:13.407 --> 42:16.574
- You'll get hurt.
- Do you know who did it?

42:16.744 --> 42:18.155
The sheriff!

42:18.371 --> 42:20.197
Fifty thousand.

42:21.249 --> 42:24.083
Don't be crazy.
Go back to your fox hunt.

42:24.293 --> 42:27.579
- You said you liked my father.
- I liked him!

42:27.755 --> 42:32.750
The cemetery's full of guys I liked!
I ain't ready to join that club!

42:36.013 --> 42:39.429
Wait a minute.
I didn't mean to holler on you.

42:39.642 --> 42:44.719
I'm just worried. I don't want
to see your pretty face pushed in.

42:45.523 --> 42:49.936
- How about we have dinner?
- I want the sheriff settled first.

42:52.613 --> 42:55.780
We can discuss
social activities afterward.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.994
You ain't dead, pal.

43:05.334 --> 43:08.288
You just put on high heels
and a skirt.

43:15.052 --> 43:18.967
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- You have more to be sorry for.

43:19.181 --> 43:21.803
Sit next to your cousin there.

43:22.685 --> 43:25.437
Look how lonesome he looks by himself.

43:26.022 --> 43:27.813
Is there an ashtray?

43:28.024 --> 43:31.060
He's worried about dirtying the floor?

43:31.277 --> 43:34.147
Before I call the meeting to order...

43:34.322 --> 43:37.441
...I want to apologize
for our surroundings.

43:37.658 --> 43:40.149
But there's nothing to worry about.

43:40.369 --> 43:44.153
What you see here
is part of the sheriff's plan...

43:44.373 --> 43:48.205
- ... how we're gonna break Robbo.
- Don't blame me for this.

43:48.419 --> 43:52.168
You're a big thinker.
Anybody can make a mistake.

43:52.381 --> 43:56.331
I called this meeting
because I thought you got a new plan.

43:56.510 --> 44:00.343
Like where will I get
the 250,000 to fix this joint?

44:00.514 --> 44:05.390
- I haven't got that kind of money.
- You ain't got it on your person.

44:05.603 --> 44:09.186
But you're getting 25%
of the juice, that's steep.

44:09.398 --> 44:14.025
I thought in view of the emergency,
you'd cut it down to 10%.

44:14.195 --> 44:16.686
Did that ever occur to you?

44:16.864 --> 44:20.696
- My people won't stand for it.
- Well, I was just asking.

44:20.910 --> 44:25.038
- I resent you putting the blame on me.
- Don't be resentful.

44:25.248 --> 44:29.874
I'd never hurt your feelings.
You're a marvelous human being.

44:30.086 --> 44:32.411
- Is the meeting done?
- That's all.

44:32.630 --> 44:35.714
I gotta go to City Hall.
Coming, Potts?

44:35.925 --> 44:38.546
Didn't you want to wait here?

44:38.719 --> 44:41.839
You were gonna see
the new insurance man?

44:43.891 --> 44:48.933
- Guy's agent's got a new life policy.
- Short-term.

44:55.695 --> 44:59.443
There's a man turned out to be
a big disappointment.

45:00.074 --> 45:05.069
Deputy? How would you describe
the word "insurance"?

45:05.288 --> 45:09.451
It's anticipating a catastrophe
and being prepared.

45:09.667 --> 45:13.036
Speaking about catastrophes,
suppose your boss...

45:13.254 --> 45:17.038
...caught a virus
and there was no more partnership.

45:17.258 --> 45:21.006
- What would the new sheriff charge?
- Ten percent.

45:24.348 --> 45:25.593
Call to order.

45:25.766 --> 45:30.559
Ways to dissolve partnership
with the old sheriff. T omatoes.

45:30.771 --> 45:34.354
- Let's pack him in limes.
- That's too dangerous.

45:34.567 --> 45:38.066
We can't take no chances
they'll find any evidence.

45:38.279 --> 45:41.446
How about making a deposit
in Lake Michigan?

45:41.616 --> 45:44.949
No good. They tried that
last year with Julius.

45:45.161 --> 45:49.372
Two days later, he's cruising
into port like a leviathan.

45:50.875 --> 45:52.914
Vermin, you got the floor.

45:53.127 --> 45:56.578
I make a motion
somebody open a window.

45:56.797 --> 46:00.166
Somebody open a window.
Fellas, let's go!

46:00.385 --> 46:04.382
You're not on a lunch break.
Think! Charlie Bananas.

46:04.638 --> 46:08.506
My uncle's a guard at
a steel mill in Gary, Indiana.

46:08.726 --> 46:11.299
How about we put him in the boiler...

46:11.479 --> 46:15.013
...throw him in with scrap,
he melts in the furnace...

46:15.233 --> 46:17.984
...next thing he's a chassis
for a Buick?!

46:18.152 --> 46:20.477
How do we get him to Indiana?

46:20.655 --> 46:25.317
I got it! Parcel post.
If we don't insure, it's very cheap.

46:25.493 --> 46:27.651
We gotta stay closer to town.

46:27.828 --> 46:31.909
Now, forget about Indiana
and the parcel post!

46:32.667 --> 46:36.499
What, Twitch?
You gonna sneeze or say something?

46:36.712 --> 46:41.006
I got a stonemason friend.
He's building some cornerstones...

46:41.175 --> 46:45.007
...for the new Knights of Pythias
building, a new bridge...

46:45.179 --> 46:47.966
- ... and the new police station.
- Go on.

46:48.182 --> 46:53.521
If someone wants to stash something,
not to be found for over 100 years...

46:53.687 --> 46:56.392
The sheriff in the police station?

46:56.607 --> 46:59.015
Will you let the man continue?

46:59.193 --> 47:04.318
The sheriff is over six feet,
the cornerstones is only three feet.

47:04.532 --> 47:09.573
- How about we fold him once?
- That'll work. Yeah, that'll work.

47:10.329 --> 47:14.991
In the police station.
I think that's very sentimental.

47:15.209 --> 47:18.459
That's like burying
a garbage man in the dump.

47:50.286 --> 47:55.244
- The sheriff will be real happy here.
- He wasn't goofing on the job.

47:55.416 --> 47:59.117
He was the first in,
and he'll be the last out.

48:00.671 --> 48:04.455
- Tell them them seats is taken.
- Them seats are taken.

48:04.675 --> 48:07.760
- Taken?
- In the back, you'll get nice seats.

48:07.928 --> 48:10.764
- Who else is coming?
- Robbo's coming.

48:10.932 --> 48:13.718
- You're kidding.
- I told him what we did.

48:13.935 --> 48:19.011
- He said he wouldn't miss it.
- I hate to disagree with you, but-

48:19.231 --> 48:20.642
Here he comes.

48:31.536 --> 48:33.327
Glad you could make it.

48:46.801 --> 48:52.139
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present
the honorable chief of police...

48:52.473 --> 48:56.340
...of our great and wonderful city:

48:56.561 --> 48:59.976
Chief Oscar C. Brockton.

49:04.402 --> 49:06.193
Thank you.

49:06.654 --> 49:10.983
Friends, it is a great privilege
and a distinct honor for me...

49:11.200 --> 49:13.738
...to dedicate this structure today.

49:13.953 --> 49:18.496
It's more than a structure.
It's a symbol of justice and order.

49:18.666 --> 49:20.706
Couldn't find a bigger room?

49:20.918 --> 49:24.334
The Knights of Pythias,
but he wasn't a member.

49:24.505 --> 49:28.005
I must inject one sad note
into these proceedings.

49:28.217 --> 49:33.009
The sudden and strange disappearance
of a man, a coworker...

49:33.180 --> 49:37.427
...who truly could be called
a cornerstone of this building:

49:37.643 --> 49:42.222
Sheriff Octavius Glick.
How I wish he were present today.

49:42.440 --> 49:44.728
Present? He's leaning on him.

49:45.151 --> 49:50.358
I trust he's out of town on business
and isn't the victim of foul play.

49:50.531 --> 49:54.114
That was no foul.
That was a solid hit.

49:55.411 --> 50:00.038
I know you will join me in
dedicating this great new building...

50:00.208 --> 50:03.541
...to Sheriff Glick,
a man of principle...

50:03.711 --> 50:08.088
...a man of determination,
a man who would not bend.

50:08.299 --> 50:12.379
- We had no trouble.
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

50:21.229 --> 50:24.229
Robbo. Listen, come here.

50:24.815 --> 50:28.647
I squared the books on Big Jim,
but I don't hear thanks.

50:28.861 --> 50:31.103
- Thanks.
- That's all you got to say?

50:31.322 --> 50:34.358
I'll give it to you straight.
Listen to me.

50:34.575 --> 50:37.529
You're out of line.
Get back in line.

50:37.745 --> 50:42.621
- Otherwise, I'm gonna have you hit.
- You do what you have to do.

50:42.833 --> 50:47.709
If that's the way you want it.
It's not for myself. I like you.

50:47.922 --> 50:51.505
But they're paying protection,
you ain't paying.

50:51.717 --> 50:55.382
- I understand.
- Then there's no hard feelings?

50:55.596 --> 50:58.266
No hard feelings. Forget it.

51:06.065 --> 51:09.481
- Liqueur in the drawing room, madame.
- Thank you.

51:14.073 --> 51:16.611
You're staring again, Robbo.

51:17.118 --> 51:20.818
I can't figure you and Big Jim
out of the same stable.

51:21.038 --> 51:23.909
If I'm not his daughter, who am I?

51:24.125 --> 51:27.328
A society dame with
the hots for tough guys.

51:27.545 --> 51:30.961
- You like society dames?
- Not especially.

51:31.632 --> 51:35.796
Then why did you accept
my invitation for dinner tonight?

51:35.970 --> 51:38.722
That's what my boys want to know.

51:38.931 --> 51:44.138
- They're worried you might be a decoy.
- Care to frisk me?

51:45.229 --> 51:46.854
I just did.

51:49.984 --> 51:52.901
Cointreau, brandy, help yourself.

51:53.112 --> 51:56.730
- What color you want?
- Cointreau, please.

52:06.417 --> 52:11.459
If I'm not Big Jim's daughter,
why did I ask you to do in his killer?

52:11.672 --> 52:14.163
For which, by the way, I thank you.

52:17.136 --> 52:22.475
I told you once, that's not my racket.
I had nothing to do with it.

52:25.103 --> 52:29.266
With Big Jim gone,
it leaves this town up for grabs.

52:29.482 --> 52:32.352
I don't know. There's still Gisborne.

52:32.568 --> 52:34.976
Father often spoke of retiring...

52:35.196 --> 52:38.980
...and the man he said he wanted
to follow him was you.

52:40.243 --> 52:41.820
Is that so?

52:43.913 --> 52:47.531
Considering where he finally went,
it's discouraging.

52:47.750 --> 52:52.910
You wouldn't be careless as to
let anyone throw you a birthday party.

52:53.422 --> 52:56.174
Only if I had a guncheck concession.

52:56.592 --> 52:59.083
It's time for the big move.

52:59.303 --> 53:02.719
Make it and it's all the way.

53:05.893 --> 53:09.760
- I get the feeling I'm being had.
- Had?

53:10.940 --> 53:12.185
Nudged.

53:12.400 --> 53:16.397
- Nudged?
- It's Italian. I'll tell you later.

53:16.571 --> 53:21.481
You misunderstand. You can take
over this town. I just want to help.

53:21.701 --> 53:25.070
When I want your help,
I'll ask for it.

53:25.246 --> 53:28.164
You want to be
a two-bit thief forever?

53:28.374 --> 53:32.454
Big Jim's daughter, sure.
I bet you never had a doll...

53:32.670 --> 53:35.126
...just a rattle on your tail.

53:35.339 --> 53:36.881
You like it dark?

53:47.477 --> 53:49.802
Some big guy comes in...

53:50.021 --> 53:54.018
...and gives me this box
from Miss Stevens.

53:54.233 --> 53:59.440
- It wasn't ticking, so I took it.
- It wasn't ticking, so you took it.

53:59.655 --> 54:04.994
There's a card too. "Thanks for
taking care of things. Marian. "

54:05.244 --> 54:08.329
I think Robbo's
an old-time mechanic.

54:08.539 --> 54:13.534
Spends an evening with a
doll and she sends $50,000.

54:14.795 --> 54:18.460
- Some girls is grateful.
- True, true.

54:18.633 --> 54:22.049
I had one like that.
She was a health nut.

54:22.261 --> 54:27.302
Whenever we went out,
she'd send me a bucket of yogurt.

54:28.267 --> 54:30.805
I think I got some stashed away.

54:31.020 --> 54:33.641
Maybe she wants some of the action?

54:33.814 --> 54:37.100
Robbo don't need no partners.

54:37.318 --> 54:41.481
- This here is yogurt.
- This is yogurt.

54:45.326 --> 54:46.357
What's this?

54:46.577 --> 54:49.614
It's from Miss Stevens.

54:49.831 --> 54:54.042
Fifty grand. America
needs you for the Olympics.

54:54.252 --> 54:56.540
She thinks I hit the sheriff.

54:56.754 --> 54:59.708
Let her be as
stubborn as she wants.

54:59.924 --> 55:02.249
- Take it back.
- Take it back?

55:02.468 --> 55:04.176
- Back.
- Back.

55:04.387 --> 55:05.667
It smells good.

55:05.846 --> 55:08.883
Wait. Can't we talk this over, boss?

55:09.100 --> 55:11.507
You'll hurt her feelings.

55:11.728 --> 55:15.227
If she's stubborn,
you'll have it back tomorrow.

55:15.439 --> 55:17.017
Dump it.

55:17.191 --> 55:18.733
You mean spread it-

55:18.901 --> 55:19.932
I don't mean that.

55:20.152 --> 55:23.604
I mean, find anything,
but get rid of it.

55:23.823 --> 55:25.981
- Okay.
- Hold it.

55:28.953 --> 55:30.198
Sorry.

55:32.540 --> 55:33.738
Back.

55:39.005 --> 55:41.330
This used to belong to Big Jim.

55:45.636 --> 55:48.886
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!

55:50.641 --> 55:54.057
Robin Hood sure is a nice guy.

56:01.819 --> 56:06.280
You want a pipe and slippers?
You paper moocher, you!

56:06.490 --> 56:11.733
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Robin Hood in Chicago!

56:11.954 --> 56:15.038
Steals from the rich
and gives to the poor!

56:15.249 --> 56:16.743
Thank you!

56:17.585 --> 56:22.377
Extra! Extra! Read all about it!
Robin Hood in Chicago!

56:24.467 --> 56:29.259
This Robin Hood's methods
differ from his predecessor.

56:29.472 --> 56:33.339
He uses gambling
and bootlegged beer...

56:33.559 --> 56:35.682
...to help orphans.

56:35.895 --> 56:38.564
All the world loves
a scoundrel, it seems...

56:38.773 --> 56:41.857
...and its newest hero is Robbo.

57:06.342 --> 57:07.670
Hold it, Robbo.

57:07.885 --> 57:10.044
Did you think this would happen?

57:10.263 --> 57:12.339
Wave your hat, Robbo.

57:13.099 --> 57:15.590
- What's the next charity?
- Which?

57:15.810 --> 57:17.304
I'll answer all your-

57:17.520 --> 57:20.141
- How far-?
- Did you hear him?

57:20.314 --> 57:21.559
Don't get smart.

57:21.774 --> 57:24.265
- What's that?
- I saw it in a movie.

57:24.485 --> 57:26.312
- Shut up.
- How far do you-?

57:26.529 --> 57:29.732
I may not like the climate
on page one.

57:29.949 --> 57:33.567
- What'd you have in mind?
- You can't print it.

57:33.786 --> 57:37.155
- This is the last?
- I'm Robbo, not Rockefeller.

57:37.373 --> 57:41.240
No more 50 grand from me.
I gotta go to work.

57:41.836 --> 57:43.994
All right, press, let's go.

57:53.347 --> 57:56.514
Who's Robin Hood?

57:57.643 --> 58:02.352
Must be some hood that steals birds.

58:02.815 --> 58:04.475
Who'd want a hot canary?

58:04.692 --> 58:06.850
- John, you know him?
- Who?

58:07.069 --> 58:08.184
This Robin Hood.

58:09.197 --> 58:10.691
He's an Englishman.

58:10.906 --> 58:14.987
He had an operation
going for him in the forest.

58:15.203 --> 58:17.575
Snatching birds, like I told ya.

58:18.372 --> 58:20.863
He had a raccoon hat.

58:22.084 --> 58:25.121
Sir Walter Raleigh had a raccoon hat.

58:25.713 --> 58:27.421
What was his angle?

58:27.632 --> 58:30.336
He put his coat over a mud puddle...

58:30.551 --> 58:34.679
...so this naked blond
could cross the street.

58:35.931 --> 58:39.383
I thought that was Daniel Boone.

58:39.560 --> 58:42.514
When you read, you larn. Learn.

58:43.773 --> 58:45.315
- Hi, boys.
- Hi.

58:45.524 --> 58:47.980
- Go see what's outside.
- What's going on?

58:48.194 --> 58:50.233
News reels and photographers.

58:50.446 --> 58:53.613
Like the boss beating a federal rap.

58:54.408 --> 58:57.196
Hey, boss, how about a shave?

58:57.411 --> 58:59.238
- No.
- How about a manicure?

58:59.413 --> 59:01.987
- I don't need one.
- Anything?

59:02.208 --> 59:04.414
- Surprise me.
- Okay.

59:04.627 --> 59:06.251
Look at these letters.

59:06.420 --> 59:10.798
"Home for the Aged," they want 10 Gs.

59:11.008 --> 59:14.508
"Home for Wayward Girls"-
I'll send something.

59:14.720 --> 59:19.097
This lady has 14 kids,
gonna be evicted.

59:19.267 --> 59:21.306
This guy who knew your dad.

59:21.519 --> 59:24.354
He wants to go to
Florida for his asthma.

59:24.772 --> 59:27.477
- Nice place for asthma.
- Send a few hundred.

59:27.692 --> 59:29.684
- They might be liars.
- Or not.

59:30.403 --> 59:33.238
You can't send everybody money.

59:33.447 --> 59:36.781
- They'll break you.
- Hey, boss.

59:36.951 --> 59:38.778
- There's a visitor.
- Who?

59:38.953 --> 59:41.029
Allen A. Dale.

59:41.247 --> 59:42.278
Send him in.

59:42.456 --> 59:45.623
He's got the whole town outside.

59:50.464 --> 59:53.999
- Is he in?
- It's in.

59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.928
Give him $300. He's got problems.

01:00:02.143 --> 01:00:06.187
No, perish the thought
at its inception, kind sir.

01:00:06.397 --> 01:00:10.062
This unheralded intrusion
into your presence...

01:00:10.276 --> 01:00:15.483
...is not with the purpose of
soliciting pecuniary offerings.

01:00:15.698 --> 01:00:18.699
I ask of you, do not misconstrue.

01:00:19.452 --> 01:00:21.740
He has a problem with his throat.

01:00:22.496 --> 01:00:26.162
So you know, I am the amanuensis...

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:29.370
...the secretary at
the institution...

01:00:29.587 --> 01:00:32.339
...which has benefitted
from your gift.

01:00:32.965 --> 01:00:36.334
I was so overcome that
I couldn't resist...

01:00:36.552 --> 01:00:39.672
...the urge to bring happy tidings...

01:00:39.847 --> 01:00:41.721
...to communications mediums.

01:00:41.933 --> 01:00:46.559
This act, sir, this act of
serendipity will be returned.

01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:49.392
He does have a problem
with his throat.

01:00:50.024 --> 01:00:51.815
- You talk English?
- Yes.

01:00:52.026 --> 01:00:54.149
- What do you want?
- Well...

01:00:54.362 --> 01:00:56.437
...I'm from the Orphan Home.

01:00:56.656 --> 01:00:59.063
I told the newspaper about you.

01:00:59.283 --> 01:01:02.154
And I made the Robin Hood comparison.

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:05.786
I didn't think it'd
take off like this.

01:01:05.998 --> 01:01:08.620
So you started this?

01:01:08.834 --> 01:01:12.120
I hope you're not disgruntled
by my impertinence.

01:01:12.338 --> 01:01:14.295
No, sit down, sit down.

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:15.882
Thank you, sir.

01:01:16.092 --> 01:01:17.123
Here you are, pops.

01:01:20.888 --> 01:01:22.797
Ain't I seen you somewhere before?

01:01:23.015 --> 01:01:26.016
I've been trailing you all day.

01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:28.184
You're popular, Mr. Robbo.

01:01:28.396 --> 01:01:30.388
A real Robin Hood.

01:01:30.648 --> 01:01:32.890
You like this character?

01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:36.229
He was the most beloved
rogue in literature.

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.901
Brave, handsome, compassionate.

01:01:39.114 --> 01:01:42.863
He's the only hood
who really made it.

01:01:43.202 --> 01:01:46.120
- I'm like him?
- Even your looks.

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:50.743
- Give this kid a drink.
- No, it's forbidden, you see.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:53.914
I've been warned
since I was brought in.

01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:57.082
Brought in? You an orphan?

01:01:57.258 --> 01:01:58.918
No, no, not an orphan.

01:01:59.135 --> 01:02:01.970
I was left with bread and a blanket.

01:02:02.763 --> 01:02:04.092
The old story.

01:02:05.516 --> 01:02:07.841
- How old were you?
- Fourteen.

01:02:08.144 --> 01:02:09.768
Why didn't you speak up?

01:02:10.646 --> 01:02:13.137
I liked the arrangement.

01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:15.267
My folks were deadbeats.

01:02:15.443 --> 01:02:16.771
We moved every other week.

01:02:16.944 --> 01:02:19.435
I learned to skip before I could walk.

01:02:19.655 --> 01:02:22.905
I was up for adoption
for 26 straight years.

01:02:23.117 --> 01:02:24.659
Terribly discouraging.

01:02:24.869 --> 01:02:27.704
Who wants a kid that's
older than his father?

01:02:27.913 --> 01:02:32.160
To fill in the time, I started doing
secretarial work at the home.

01:02:34.337 --> 01:02:39.627
- How about you move in with us?
- You mean you want to adopt me, sir?

01:02:39.842 --> 01:02:43.792
Tears your heart out, don't it?
No, I didn't mean that.

01:02:43.971 --> 01:02:48.633
Maybe you could help with the mail.
Separate sinceres from crocodiles.

01:02:48.809 --> 01:02:50.767
Send a couple dollars apiece.

01:02:50.978 --> 01:02:54.596
We got no time. We're rebuilding
a knocked-over joint.

01:02:54.815 --> 01:02:58.480
I'd be of inestimable service.
I could write speeches.

01:02:58.653 --> 01:03:02.485
Give items to the newspapers,
take care of your charities.

01:03:02.656 --> 01:03:05.147
I'd make you a legend
in your own time.

01:03:05.326 --> 01:03:10.237
- Start him off with a C-note a week.
- Thank you, sir, and bless you.

01:03:10.456 --> 01:03:12.994
Oh, gee, I'm a hood.

01:03:13.292 --> 01:03:15.332
I'm a hood! Ho!

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:20.834
That's a hood?

01:03:23.469 --> 01:03:26.340
That's right, right on in.
Take your place in line.

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:30.346
There you go. Right back here,
there's plenty for everyone.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.395
Right on in.
You get right in here, sir.

01:03:48.911 --> 01:03:51.746
There you are, Mark.
Here's one for you.

01:03:51.956 --> 01:03:53.236
- You new?
- Yes, sir.

01:03:53.457 --> 01:03:56.209
There you are.
Here's your Robin Hood hat.

01:03:56.377 --> 01:04:00.042
- The feather goes in the hat.
- In your hat!

01:04:00.214 --> 01:04:02.373
I don't appreciate your attitude.

01:04:02.592 --> 01:04:05.877
Mr. Robbo was considerate enough
to give us this.

01:04:06.053 --> 01:04:08.840
Accept it graciously
and be a merry man.

01:04:09.056 --> 01:04:11.678
That cockamamie outfit? You're nuts.

01:04:11.892 --> 01:04:16.020
- I got enough trouble being an orphan.
- Yeah. He gots trouble.

01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:20.892
I'm attempting to bring some
cohesiveness into this motley group.

01:04:21.068 --> 01:04:24.603
If you're going into a snippy snit,
remaining aloof...

01:04:24.822 --> 01:04:29.947
...I'll report you to the deportment
department with 12 demerits.

01:04:30.161 --> 01:04:32.830
I think something's wrong
with his throat.

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.746
That could mean automatic expulsion
from the brass band.

01:04:36.917 --> 01:04:39.373
What's the rap for shooting
an orphan with an arrow?

01:04:39.587 --> 01:04:40.618
I don't know.

01:04:40.838 --> 01:04:44.005
Hear ye, hear ye,
merry men of Robin Hood!

01:04:44.216 --> 01:04:48.925
I gaze upon you with pride and
admiration, 25, 24, brave, fearless...

01:04:49.096 --> 01:04:53.343
...courageous warriors dedicated
to the cause of right and truth.

01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:55.433
All hail Robin Hood!

01:04:55.645 --> 01:04:58.480
All hail Robin Hood!

01:05:00.649 --> 01:05:02.891
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:05.269
- Hip-hip-hooray!
- Hip-hip-hooray!

01:05:09.575 --> 01:05:11.900
You may turn in your tuba.

01:05:15.039 --> 01:05:19.119
- How do you like the sign, Robbo?
- That ain't bad.

01:05:19.293 --> 01:05:21.701
- Why not try it there?
- You got it.

01:05:21.921 --> 01:05:24.459
That ain't from the five-and-dime.

01:05:24.632 --> 01:05:27.586
- The costumes come yet?
- I ain't seen them.

01:05:27.802 --> 01:05:29.379
Maybe you better check.

01:05:29.595 --> 01:05:34.553
- More flowers. Lovely, ain't they?
- Yeah, they're lovely, yeah.

01:05:34.767 --> 01:05:38.302
- Got everything you need?
- Enough to float a battleship.

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:41.640
- How are you doing?
- What do I do with these?

01:05:41.857 --> 01:05:44.146
They usually belong on
gambling tables.

01:05:44.318 --> 01:05:47.770
-5000, 3000, 1000.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:50.314
- And count them.
- Me count?

01:05:50.533 --> 01:05:54.862
- How about raising the chandeliers?
- Ridiculous.

01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:58.448
- What did you say?
- We're gonna raise them.

01:06:03.921 --> 01:06:06.590
How do I know where your knitting is?

01:06:07.508 --> 01:06:09.133
What, are you tired, pal?

01:06:09.343 --> 01:06:12.510
I've been interviewing
cigarette girls all day.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.432
Good thing we only need two.
Come on.

01:06:19.437 --> 01:06:22.604
Do you think three dozen cans
will be adequate?

01:06:23.232 --> 01:06:24.857
That's all we ordered.

01:06:25.067 --> 01:06:28.732
I'll give the young ladies
a promotional talk.

01:06:28.946 --> 01:06:33.655
We'll open the joint in two hours,
so go home and get dressed.

01:06:33.868 --> 01:06:37.284
- Dressed, sir?
- This ain't a Halloween party.

01:06:37.497 --> 01:06:40.747
This is a classy opening.
You need decent clothes.

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:43.710
- I don't understand.
- Look at how you look.

01:06:43.878 --> 01:06:47.543
- Better you don't look.
- Yeah, maybe not.

01:07:04.231 --> 01:07:06.354
Am I correct in my assumption...

01:07:06.567 --> 01:07:09.237
...you find my habiliments
reprehensible?

01:07:09.445 --> 01:07:13.395
- Something's wrong with his throat.
- I said that six weeks ago.

01:07:21.082 --> 01:07:24.498
I hate to belabor the obvious,
but in the interest of semantics...

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:28.578
...I'm impelled to observe you
indulged in a mixed metaphor.

01:07:28.756 --> 01:07:30.464
- It's his throat.
- His throat.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.836
You look like something
of a disaster area.

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:56.042
You think I'm too bizarre?

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:59.214
I think you're too carnival.
Get out of here.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.959
Do you mind?

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:36.831
Well!

01:11:24.825 --> 01:11:26.617
- Hooray!
- Hooray!

01:12:41.986 --> 01:12:45.354
Sweetheart, buy the boys a drink,
will you?

01:13:02.089 --> 01:13:05.209
-14, red.
- Oh, dear, I lost again.

01:13:05.426 --> 01:13:07.584
She lost again, listen to this.

01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:13.090
- May I have $1 worth of 10-cent chips?
- Another dollar in 10-cent chips.

01:13:13.684 --> 01:13:15.060
How do you figure it?

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:19.720
What's to figure?
They're all over at Robbo's place.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.432
All of a sudden the bum's a celebrity.

01:13:22.610 --> 01:13:26.275
They made him into a Jean Harlow,
a Mickey Mouse.

01:13:26.447 --> 01:13:30.943
He gave $3 to a couple orphans and
they put his picture in the papers.

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.865
People want to look at him.
He's a celebrity.

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:38.291
In the meantime, I'm dying here.
Look at this joint.

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:41.200
But I've got nothing to worry about.

01:13:41.504 --> 01:13:44.291
Because I'm paying you protection.

01:13:44.465 --> 01:13:48.332
Just temporary, the novelty will soon
wear off, and you'll get the business.

01:13:48.553 --> 01:13:51.968
Somebody else will get the business
before then.

01:13:52.348 --> 01:13:54.637
What do you expect me to do?

01:13:55.727 --> 01:13:58.976
Cut down on your cocoa.
We'll start with that.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.810
My mind's made up. I'll send 50 of
my best boys there with cannons.

01:14:03.984 --> 01:14:07.982
They'll wipe out the whole joint.
One of them will get Robbo.

01:14:10.157 --> 01:14:12.648
Please! That would be a catastrophe.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:17.661
He has lots of influential friends.
The whole town would be down on us.

01:14:17.832 --> 01:14:20.405
What should I do with this joint?

01:14:20.626 --> 01:14:23.413
Be patient, wait a few days.
I have a plan.

01:14:23.629 --> 01:14:27.674
We don't have to use violence.
We lick Robbo by breaking him.

01:14:28.009 --> 01:14:30.500
- What was that?
- We break him!

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:34.800
That's what your cousin, the
other scientist I listened to-

01:14:35.015 --> 01:14:38.182
Just let me finish.
We'll knock over the joint.

01:14:38.352 --> 01:14:41.187
This time we'll make
the raid official.

01:14:41.355 --> 01:14:45.816
I'll use real cops. Keep the men
here in case he should hit back.

01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.732
- How many cops?
-20.

01:14:50.615 --> 01:14:51.645
Thirty.

01:14:52.324 --> 01:14:53.356
Thirty.

01:14:53.701 --> 01:14:55.824
- We'll move next week.
- Tonight.

01:14:56.037 --> 01:14:58.528
The place is full of big shots,
judges-

01:14:58.748 --> 01:15:00.159
Tonight.

01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:03.751
To the ground.

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:18.215
Something for the cause, please?

01:15:18.559 --> 01:15:20.302
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:23.470
Oh, you back so soon?

01:15:28.569 --> 01:15:32.270
Honey, you do have the busiest can
in the place.

01:15:36.702 --> 01:15:38.077
Here you are.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:44.658
Empty it. Empty it. Empty it.

01:15:48.464 --> 01:15:49.495
Thank you.

01:16:13.322 --> 01:16:16.074
- How do you like it?
- Good evening.

01:16:16.283 --> 01:16:19.119
Congratulations.
A wonderful night for you.

01:16:19.286 --> 01:16:24.447
- Congratulations to you, if it works.
- It will work, all right.

01:16:24.625 --> 01:16:27.413
You got your chance. It better work.

01:16:27.628 --> 01:16:29.537
Oh, it will work.

01:16:29.922 --> 01:16:30.954
I hope.

01:16:40.808 --> 01:16:45.304
All right, everybody knows what to do.
Now go to your stations.

01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:52.021
- You too. Come on!
- Okay, yeah.

01:16:54.655 --> 01:16:57.989
- I can't find my clothes.
- What do you mean-?

01:16:58.159 --> 01:17:00.732
There they are. Will you come on?

01:17:04.999 --> 01:17:06.493
Everybody set?

01:17:17.803 --> 01:17:20.674
Ladies and gentlemen,
a slight delay.

01:17:20.848 --> 01:17:23.968
T ake your chips
and go to the lounge, please.

01:17:24.227 --> 01:17:26.350
No need for alarm.

01:17:27.021 --> 01:17:28.765
Head for the lounge.

01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:30.353
That's it.

01:17:35.488 --> 01:17:37.314
Move right along there.

01:18:27.581 --> 01:18:29.705
Peace be with you, brother.

01:18:29.917 --> 01:18:33.084
Club is in violation of code 378.
Destroy it!

01:18:34.213 --> 01:18:36.253
Peace be with you, brother.

01:18:55.234 --> 01:18:57.108
Holy smokes.

01:18:57.945 --> 01:19:00.566
I'd have sworn there was
a joint here.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:06.072
Friends, we are gathered here tonight
to honor a good man, a righteous man.

01:19:06.454 --> 01:19:09.657
- We got the wrong place.
- How could we?

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:13.041
I am proud to introduce to you...

01:19:13.252 --> 01:19:16.039
...the Reverend Allen A. Dale.

01:19:30.812 --> 01:19:33.517
We are gathered here this evening,
brothers and sisters...

01:19:33.689 --> 01:19:38.150
...to explore the devious paths
of that demon: sin.

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:43.653
Sin can transport you to heights
of fame and fortune...

01:19:43.824 --> 01:19:48.486
...and plunge you to degradation,
demoralization and depravation.

01:19:51.332 --> 01:19:54.832
Sin promises many prizes,
appears in many disguises...

01:19:55.044 --> 01:19:58.330
...and fights like hell
before it demises.

01:20:02.426 --> 01:20:05.842
So we are met this evening in this
hallowed hall...

01:20:06.305 --> 01:20:10.634
...so you may recognize sin's henchmen
when they call.

01:20:11.352 --> 01:20:15.302
And our subject for tonight
is the most evil of them all.

01:20:15.522 --> 01:20:17.812
Who that? I mean, who's that?

01:20:19.026 --> 01:20:20.520
Alcohol.

01:21:02.987 --> 01:21:05.312
I'll testify. I want to testify.

01:21:05.531 --> 01:21:08.236
Then cleanse yourself, my child.

01:21:08.409 --> 01:21:11.196
I know this poor, unfortunate soul...

01:21:11.412 --> 01:21:14.366
...and the fight
she's waging against sin.

01:21:14.582 --> 01:21:18.247
That devil hooch has turned her
into an unsightly person.

01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:23.752
- Give us your testimony, my child.
- Well, it all began with Daddy.

01:21:25.468 --> 01:21:28.753
There's a gambling layout here
and we'll find it.

01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:33.219
Do you know how old he was
when he died?

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.055
He was 25.

01:21:39.273 --> 01:21:41.943
That's why I've got to come clean.

01:21:42.151 --> 01:21:45.603
- Why?
- Because I'm already 17.

01:22:18.062 --> 01:22:22.688
I want to testify!
You've got to let me testify.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.474
Come forward, dear brother.
Come forward.

01:22:25.653 --> 01:22:28.404
You see here a man who
just last year...

01:22:28.614 --> 01:22:32.778
...was the United States Olympic
heavyweight wrestling champion.

01:22:32.994 --> 01:22:36.991
A shadow of his former self,
wasted in health, ravaged by sin.

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:39.287
Give us your testimony, brother.

01:22:39.917 --> 01:22:41.625
I was cruel.

01:22:41.836 --> 01:22:46.047
- I was mean.
- He was mean.

01:22:46.257 --> 01:22:47.632
I was a...

01:22:47.842 --> 01:22:49.419
...pickpocket.

01:22:49.635 --> 01:22:52.672
Oh, no, not a pickpocket!

01:22:52.930 --> 01:22:54.508
Then, sin got me in-

01:22:54.682 --> 01:22:57.054
- Gin.
- A little bit of that too.

01:22:57.268 --> 01:23:01.681
Sin and gin got me in its clutches.
That's why I need forgiving.

01:23:01.897 --> 01:23:05.895
Now my hand shakes so much,
I can't even make a living.

01:23:18.039 --> 01:23:21.538
How do you believe this?
I tell you, it walked away?

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:23.542
Knock down the walls-

01:23:23.752 --> 01:23:27.371
- It's a revival meeting.
- It ain't a revival meeting.

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:30.081
Every crapshooter in town's here.

01:23:30.301 --> 01:23:32.874
There's a joint here. We'll find it.

01:23:36.223 --> 01:23:38.797
- I want to testify.
- You don't have to-

01:23:39.018 --> 01:23:41.058
- I want to.
- You don't have to-

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:44.556
- Oh, let him testify.
- Very well.

01:23:44.773 --> 01:23:49.234
Then let us lead you on the path
of righteousness. Not long ago...

01:23:49.445 --> 01:23:53.573
...he was the foremost brain surgeon
in this grand and glorious country.

01:23:53.783 --> 01:23:55.989
Success was smiling upon him.

01:23:56.202 --> 01:23:59.902
Go ahead, tell us your story,
oh, downtrodden one.

01:24:03.626 --> 01:24:07.754
I used spirits for medicinal
purposes only.

01:24:08.464 --> 01:24:12.675
I manufactured it for medicinal
purposes only.

01:24:14.261 --> 01:24:17.097
Then I drank what I manufactured...

01:24:17.265 --> 01:24:21.476
...and drank myself out of business
for medicinal purposes only.

01:24:21.686 --> 01:24:23.927
That's right!

01:24:47.503 --> 01:24:50.457
- I give up. I'm pulling my men.
- You can't.

01:24:50.631 --> 01:24:53.751
If I don't pull them,
I won't have any.

01:24:58.139 --> 01:24:59.882
We're leaving.

01:25:13.195 --> 01:25:15.235
Peace be with you, brother.

01:25:16.449 --> 01:25:18.821
You, brother, you can drop dead.

01:25:19.452 --> 01:25:21.278
Peace, all you fine gentlemen.

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.383
Now Robbo's a national personality.
People love him.

01:26:20.596 --> 01:26:23.846
They spend money in his joint
while we're dying.

01:26:24.058 --> 01:26:27.392
My old man's getting
free soup every day.

01:26:27.604 --> 01:26:29.726
Not important. Forget about it.

01:26:29.897 --> 01:26:32.898
I think he's a threat
to the younger generation.

01:26:33.108 --> 01:26:37.569
I caught a kid stealing my tires,
he pulls a bow and arrow on me.

01:26:37.738 --> 01:26:40.360
My old man gets free soup every day-

01:26:40.575 --> 01:26:42.567
Forget about that soup already!

01:26:42.785 --> 01:26:45.786
If you're so impressed,
go join his merry men.

01:26:45.997 --> 01:26:50.659
Stick a feather in your ear, walk
around in green drag, you'll be happy.

01:26:50.876 --> 01:26:55.373
What's the matter? You can't see
what he's doing in your heads?

01:26:55.589 --> 01:26:57.546
I gotta explain that to you.

01:26:57.758 --> 01:27:02.135
This man's organizing himself the
biggest bodyguard there ever was:

01:27:02.346 --> 01:27:03.924
The people of Chicago.

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.303
He's in so thick with them, you
can't touch him with a flagpole.

01:27:08.519 --> 01:27:11.354
Now once and for all,
this man's gotta go.

01:27:11.814 --> 01:27:14.981
We can't have any violence,
I warn you.

01:27:15.192 --> 01:27:18.276
Forget the warnings. Just sit down.

01:27:18.863 --> 01:27:23.774
My friend is working on
a cornerstone for a synagogue.

01:27:23.993 --> 01:27:27.243
- No.
- Even if we get Robbo to convert?

01:27:27.455 --> 01:27:30.242
Disappearing is the same as hitting.

01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:35.210
- Open a window.
- I got an idea.

01:27:36.255 --> 01:27:38.046
Somebody open a window anyway.

01:27:38.257 --> 01:27:43.464
Before we offed the sheriff,
I took some things from him.

01:27:43.679 --> 01:27:48.306
His badge, his gun, his
wallet with his driver's license.

01:27:49.435 --> 01:27:50.930
Keep talking, Vermin.

01:27:51.145 --> 01:27:53.387
Maybe we could use the stuff.

01:27:53.814 --> 01:27:56.057
We could put it in a certain place.

01:27:57.484 --> 01:28:02.823
I like what you're saying.
Keep talking. Just keep talking.

01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:06.153
I don't have
experience in this area.

01:28:06.369 --> 01:28:08.741
But I think I can handle it.

01:28:16.670 --> 01:28:20.004
Do you swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:28:20.216 --> 01:28:22.255
- I do.
- Take the stand.

01:28:27.557 --> 01:28:31.340
Mr. Gisborne, tell the
court of a conversation...

01:28:31.561 --> 01:28:36.187
...between you and the defendant
after Big Jim's murder.

01:28:36.399 --> 01:28:39.684
I'll tell you that story now.

01:28:39.902 --> 01:28:43.520
I was in the hotel
with some friends...

01:28:43.781 --> 01:28:47.281
...we meet to play mahjong.

01:28:47.493 --> 01:28:51.906
It's 12:30, Robbo comes in.
He don't knock, nothing.

01:28:52.123 --> 01:28:55.990
He barges right in,
and he declares himself.

01:28:56.210 --> 01:29:01.252
He says this, I'll never
forget it, now that Big Jim...

01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:03.125
...has gone to meet his maker...

01:29:03.342 --> 01:29:08.218
...he's decided- He means
that the man was dead.

01:29:08.431 --> 01:29:10.637
I want you to understand.

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:12.759
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:29:12.977 --> 01:29:16.761
Now he says Big Jim is
dead, he's the new boss...

01:29:16.981 --> 01:29:21.976
...and everybody has to pay him
a 50 percent service charge...

01:29:22.194 --> 01:29:24.068
...that's for protection.

01:29:24.822 --> 01:29:27.230
Tell me, Mr. Gisborne...

01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:30.569
...what was your reaction?

01:29:31.704 --> 01:29:35.998
Stunned. I was stunned.
In other words, I couldn't talk.

01:29:36.208 --> 01:29:40.420
Finally, I regained my composure,
and I said to him:

01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:44.420
"Robbo. Why do we
need a new boss for?

01:29:44.634 --> 01:29:47.753
We've got an honest man,
Sheriff Glick. "

01:29:48.763 --> 01:29:50.921
What did he say to that?

01:29:51.182 --> 01:29:52.842
You want the exact words?

01:29:53.059 --> 01:29:54.767
The exact words.

01:29:54.936 --> 01:30:00.178
Here's what he said.
"Don't worry about Sheriff Glick...

01:30:00.399 --> 01:30:03.436
...because I'm going
to fix his wagon. "

01:30:03.611 --> 01:30:06.861
Next thing I know,
the wagon is fixed.

01:30:07.615 --> 01:30:10.984
Did Robbo say how he planned to...

01:30:11.202 --> 01:30:13.775
...fix the sheriff's wagon?

01:30:13.996 --> 01:30:17.282
He did not.
But I'll tell you this.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:21.284
When he fixes a wagon,
it's an interesting ride.

01:30:21.504 --> 01:30:24.837
I object. This
comes from a witness...

01:30:25.049 --> 01:30:28.750
...who is a convicted
murderer and racketeer.

01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:30.345
He is under oath...

01:30:30.555 --> 01:30:33.888
...he knows the
consequences for lying.

01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:38.346
- Absolutely.
- Objection overruled.

01:30:38.562 --> 01:30:40.472
Thank you. He's nice.

01:30:40.648 --> 01:30:43.981
That will be all, Mr. Gisborne.
Sit down.

01:30:46.654 --> 01:30:48.113
Deputy Potts...

01:30:49.407 --> 01:30:53.902
...were there meetings
between Robbo and the sheriff...

01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.987
- ... prior to the murder.
- One, in particular.

01:30:58.208 --> 01:31:02.075
Robbo said something
would happen to Big Jim...

01:31:02.294 --> 01:31:06.873
...and asked the sheriff
if he wanted protection.

01:31:07.091 --> 01:31:09.582
The sheriff threw him out.

01:31:09.802 --> 01:31:13.171
I see. Did Robbo
contact him after this?

01:31:13.348 --> 01:31:18.554
He threatened him.
The sheriff was in fear of his life.

01:31:19.103 --> 01:31:23.397
In other words, the
sheriff could not be bribed.

01:31:23.607 --> 01:31:26.644
A man of honesty and integrity.

01:31:26.861 --> 01:31:31.522
- Y es.
- An upstanding public official.

01:31:34.702 --> 01:31:38.236
A very solid citizen.

01:31:46.297 --> 01:31:49.998
I've just returned from
a visit with our leader.

01:31:50.217 --> 01:31:53.966
What are we now?
The merry men of 574392?

01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:56.801
I demand to see the warden.

01:31:57.016 --> 01:32:00.432
I find your levity
tasteless and macabre.

01:32:00.645 --> 01:32:05.021
- How did he kill the sheriff?
- He didn't have anything to do...

01:32:05.232 --> 01:32:08.233
...with that.
Don't you believe him?

01:32:09.278 --> 01:32:11.603
Anybody want a hat?

01:32:11.822 --> 01:32:15.405
There's a good lesson
to learn from this.

01:32:15.618 --> 01:32:18.109
Robbo made mistakes in the past...

01:32:18.329 --> 01:32:21.081
...but they've come back to haunt him.

01:34:27.875 --> 01:34:29.868
Boy can he dance.

01:36:11.312 --> 01:36:12.854
I was framed!

01:36:22.907 --> 01:36:25.576
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thank you.

01:36:28.204 --> 01:36:31.738
Tell me, why did you leave Indiana?

01:36:32.416 --> 01:36:37.208
The boss, Grubby Mattson,
had a girl named Bumblebee O'Neill...

01:36:37.421 --> 01:36:42.333
...she was a dancer and he got
worried that I was also with her.

01:36:42.551 --> 01:36:47.509
He didn't like somebody else getting
the honey, so I decided to buzz off.

01:36:48.641 --> 01:36:51.428
You have two weaknesses:
women and pool.

01:36:52.562 --> 01:36:55.349
The day I find a gal that can
handle a cue, I got it made.

01:36:57.024 --> 01:37:01.104
Father taught me the game
when I was 12.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:06.113
- I still play once in a while.
- What kind do you like?

01:37:06.325 --> 01:37:07.868
Rotation.

01:37:10.246 --> 01:37:11.705
That figures.

01:37:15.543 --> 01:37:18.248
Brandy, Cointreau, help yourself.

01:37:18.462 --> 01:37:21.297
- And you?
- Brandy, please.

01:37:30.057 --> 01:37:31.386
John?

01:37:32.685 --> 01:37:36.517
- Where do go you from here?
- Robbo's store.

01:37:37.481 --> 01:37:40.648
- May take 20 years.
- At 2000 a week, I'll eat.

01:37:45.197 --> 01:37:46.857
- John.
- Yes?

01:37:47.658 --> 01:37:50.232
Do you always want
to be a storekeeper?

01:37:50.411 --> 01:37:54.076
When you see something you want,
you should take it.

01:37:55.541 --> 01:37:58.032
I'm beginning to get the ringings.

01:38:00.254 --> 01:38:03.255
I think we're on two different tracks.

01:38:03.466 --> 01:38:06.253
Keep talking.
We'll come to a junction.

01:38:06.677 --> 01:38:09.382
Just give me the right proposition.

01:38:10.348 --> 01:38:14.760
You're on top of the rightest
proposition you've had.

01:38:16.604 --> 01:38:21.645
If you're talking about taking over,
forget it. Robbo's my pal.

01:38:22.318 --> 01:38:24.357
Who's talking about that?

01:38:25.112 --> 01:38:29.276
I'm talking about using
what you have to its fullest.

01:38:30.284 --> 01:38:34.152
- Like what?
- Like the charities.

01:38:34.538 --> 01:38:36.780
If I had my way, I'd dump it all.

01:38:39.919 --> 01:38:42.789
It's the best horse in the race.

01:38:46.801 --> 01:38:52.008
- You talk like you want to be a jockey.
- You look like a front-runner.

01:38:55.518 --> 01:38:57.973
I think it's post time.

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.485
Let's make it a nice, long race.

01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:21.161
How do they look?

01:39:22.753 --> 01:39:25.245
Not good, Robbo. We'll appeal.

01:39:25.464 --> 01:39:27.208
The prospects are bad, but-

01:39:27.425 --> 01:39:29.500
- How bad?
- Twenty.

01:39:30.261 --> 01:39:34.009
- Years?
- If you're lucky.

01:39:34.682 --> 01:39:36.509
That's a lot of license plates.

01:39:36.684 --> 01:39:38.511
Everybody rise.

01:39:38.769 --> 01:39:40.478
Cook County, lllinois.

01:39:40.687 --> 01:39:42.597
Judge Komp presiding.

01:39:45.943 --> 01:39:49.775
Defendant is present.
Have you reached a verdict?

01:39:50.114 --> 01:39:54.527
It's irregular,
but I would like to make a statement.

01:39:54.910 --> 01:39:56.108
Proceed.

01:39:56.579 --> 01:40:01.739
For four weeks, this jury has
listened to the testimony.

01:40:02.209 --> 01:40:06.539
The defendant not only
supposedly killed the sheriff...

01:40:06.922 --> 01:40:11.465
...he started the Chicago Fire,
and killed Cock Robin.

01:40:13.471 --> 01:40:16.008
I've been a detective for 34 years...

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.433
...and I've seen good ringers.

01:40:21.312 --> 01:40:25.890
I think the prosecution
deserves congratulations for having...

01:40:26.066 --> 01:40:28.309
...the best collection...

01:40:28.527 --> 01:40:32.478
...of shifty-eyed, double-crossing
two-faced liars.

01:40:34.033 --> 01:40:38.494
This jury declares
the defendant innocent.

01:40:55.930 --> 01:40:58.171
Who mentioned Cock Robin?

01:40:58.390 --> 01:41:00.383
Things like this happen.

01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:09.238
Hey, boss, welcome home!

01:44:09.749 --> 01:44:10.947
Hey, boss!

01:44:11.458 --> 01:44:14.294
It's great to be back, everybody.

01:44:14.461 --> 01:44:17.416
I want the biggest
blowout ever seen tonight.

01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:19.713
Balloons and streamers.

01:44:19.884 --> 01:44:23.300
I'll get the dough for some shopping.

01:44:23.471 --> 01:44:24.965
What's the matter?

01:44:25.181 --> 01:44:26.675
It's been changed.

01:44:28.684 --> 01:44:29.716
Who changed it?

01:44:29.936 --> 01:44:32.474
- John, sir.
- Why?

01:44:32.646 --> 01:44:34.474
He thought you'd be-

01:44:34.649 --> 01:44:36.273
Change it back.

01:44:37.443 --> 01:44:40.479
Where's John been?
He wasn't at the trial.

01:44:40.654 --> 01:44:42.694
He's working on the charities.

01:44:42.907 --> 01:44:46.276
- That's your job.
- There have been changes.

01:44:46.869 --> 01:44:48.778
That so?

01:44:49.330 --> 01:44:51.239
Let's take a look.

01:44:51.749 --> 01:44:55.581
- Will he do anything rash?
- I hope he gets the same jury.

01:45:07.223 --> 01:45:10.093
Hi, boys. Hello, men.

01:45:12.853 --> 01:45:14.893
Everything seems okay.

01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:25.901
Open it.

01:45:43.759 --> 01:45:46.048
When did you get out?

01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.596
Where's John?

01:45:47.805 --> 01:45:50.972
Does anybody know
where the chief is?

01:45:51.434 --> 01:45:53.142
- The chief?
- Yeah, the chief.

01:45:53.353 --> 01:45:56.187
He's with her royal majesty.

01:45:56.397 --> 01:45:58.437
Yeah, that's where he is.

01:46:09.785 --> 01:46:13.913
Reports from Atlanta are great.
They passed 50,000 in 48 hours.

01:46:14.123 --> 01:46:17.409
Gus, New England is wide open.

01:46:17.626 --> 01:46:19.915
Get a soup kitchen in Boston.

01:46:21.547 --> 01:46:24.038
If they don't
drink minestrone...

01:46:24.258 --> 01:46:27.294
...toss in some clams
and call it chowder.

01:46:28.971 --> 01:46:30.596
Keep in touch.

01:46:35.394 --> 01:46:39.606
You should get up to see
if your legs still work.

01:46:39.774 --> 01:46:43.225
With something like you,
who needs legs?

01:46:48.741 --> 01:46:51.528
- I don't think-
- That's a good idea.

01:46:52.453 --> 01:46:54.576
Jail's out early today.

01:46:55.665 --> 01:46:59.614
I'm disappointed. I'd respect you
if you took over alone.

01:46:59.835 --> 01:47:03.785
It's not a takeover.
We raised the action.

01:47:03.964 --> 01:47:06.502
- It still has your name.
- Thanks.

01:47:06.717 --> 01:47:08.460
Show him the report.

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:12.840
We got no rules
for dames in our racket...

01:47:13.057 --> 01:47:16.971
...but you pay if you make a mistake,
so no more mistakes.

01:47:17.812 --> 01:47:22.141
That, I take it, is a special reprieve
for Big Jim's daughter.

01:47:22.316 --> 01:47:27.523
You're charitable. I'll tell you
how to be even more charitable.

01:47:28.531 --> 01:47:31.448
The Robin Hood Foundation stays as is.

01:47:31.659 --> 01:47:36.285
You will have an office,
where you will be given a pen...

01:47:36.497 --> 01:47:39.202
...and an allowance
for your benefaction.

01:47:40.334 --> 01:47:45.673
With only one slight modification:
I take, you give.

01:47:49.844 --> 01:47:51.386
My gift to you.

01:47:55.934 --> 01:47:57.511
You didn't do that right.

01:47:57.727 --> 01:48:00.811
Don't tell him he's a stooge,
he's got pride.

01:48:01.021 --> 01:48:02.895
He's got nothing!

01:48:03.691 --> 01:48:07.309
You should have
tried for a partnership.

01:48:07.528 --> 01:48:09.853
Robbo is no longer a consideration.

01:48:10.072 --> 01:48:13.690
We've got his rep,
tonight you get rid of him.

01:48:14.202 --> 01:48:16.110
I like Robbo.

01:48:16.328 --> 01:48:19.579
- I'm not hitting.
- You're scared.

01:48:19.791 --> 01:48:22.625
Not of him, you. You move too fast.

01:48:22.835 --> 01:48:25.326
I like things easy. I'm packing.

01:48:25.546 --> 01:48:29.129
I take a candy store Romeo...

01:48:29.508 --> 01:48:34.217
...stick half of Chicago in
his pocket, and this is my payoff?

01:48:34.889 --> 01:48:38.554
A guy shouldn't work
for a boss with great legs.

01:48:38.893 --> 01:48:44.231
Keeps his mind off business.
Robbo, he crosses his legs, nothing.

01:48:54.492 --> 01:48:56.817
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thanks.

01:48:59.664 --> 01:49:03.080
So you're Big Jim's little girl.

01:49:04.585 --> 01:49:07.420
You sure didn't inherit his build.

01:49:09.256 --> 01:49:12.590
- That's charming.
- I know some jokes.

01:49:13.511 --> 01:49:15.302
We must move quickly.

01:49:15.846 --> 01:49:17.673
- Guy.
- What?

01:49:18.933 --> 01:49:23.678
Call me Guy.
I want you to feel free with me.

01:49:24.939 --> 01:49:26.979
By quickly, I mean tonight.

01:49:27.650 --> 01:49:31.896
Tomorrow's better.
Tonight we get to know one another.

01:49:32.113 --> 01:49:34.022
We'll break up the ice a little.

01:49:34.949 --> 01:49:36.989
We move tonight or never.

01:49:37.952 --> 01:49:42.080
Tonight? I'm not against that.

01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:44.662
I'd like to move right now.

01:49:44.875 --> 01:49:47.331
Is anyone using this room?

01:49:48.128 --> 01:49:52.256
It's very rude to rise
when I'm still seated.

01:49:52.466 --> 01:49:56.464
- Stand up then.
- Charming.

01:49:56.637 --> 01:49:58.345
I can be debonair.

01:49:58.556 --> 01:50:00.465
Can I move this chair?

01:50:00.641 --> 01:50:04.425
I'm too far from you.
You're beautiful.

01:50:05.646 --> 01:50:09.727
- Mr. Gisborne.
- Guy. Call me Guy.

01:50:10.609 --> 01:50:13.979
While Robbo was away,
I got the charities.

01:50:14.154 --> 01:50:16.313
John was fronting for me.

01:50:17.033 --> 01:50:19.239
So you were behind that?

01:50:19.452 --> 01:50:24.161
I didn't think it was John,
because what does he know?

01:50:25.291 --> 01:50:29.585
I built it, and I have no
intention of giving it up.

01:50:30.337 --> 01:50:32.626
But I can't fight Robbo alone.

01:50:33.591 --> 01:50:38.052
Take care of him
and you and I can have a partnership.

01:50:39.680 --> 01:50:42.349
I like the whole idea.

01:50:42.684 --> 01:50:44.676
There's a few problems.

01:50:44.894 --> 01:50:50.019
It's not easy. He could get you
with both hands in his pockets.

01:50:50.232 --> 01:50:54.895
He could shoot with his navel.
Second, he's got friends.

01:50:55.112 --> 01:50:58.896
The people of Chicago
have made him into a hero.

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:02.865
That Robin Hood's been dead
600 years don't matter.

01:51:03.037 --> 01:51:05.493
Number three is his pal John.

01:51:05.707 --> 01:51:07.948
They're close, like this here.

01:51:08.167 --> 01:51:12.379
- You have to hit two, not one.
- Then hit two.

01:51:13.672 --> 01:51:14.704
Hit two?

01:51:15.216 --> 01:51:18.382
This operation clears 100,000 a week.

01:51:19.053 --> 01:51:23.549
In three months we can double that.
In a year, the moon.

01:51:24.392 --> 01:51:26.930
What'll we do with Deputy Potts?

01:51:27.228 --> 01:51:28.888
Get rid of him too.

01:51:29.063 --> 01:51:33.310
Him too. Who was
your mother, Dutch Schulz?

01:51:33.692 --> 01:51:37.393
I'll hit two, not the deputy.
He's protection.

01:51:38.113 --> 01:51:43.072
- Very well, forget the sheriff.
- Oh, thank you.

01:51:44.495 --> 01:51:46.867
That's two we're hitting.

01:51:47.456 --> 01:51:51.406
- That's a double jackknife.
- A double jackknife?

01:51:51.919 --> 01:51:55.122
That's a dry dive.
You have a phone?

01:52:01.762 --> 01:52:03.920
- Proceed.
- Thank you.

01:52:07.602 --> 01:52:10.271
Garfield 5525.

01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:13.229
Twitchy? Gisborne.

01:52:13.858 --> 01:52:16.812
Listen, regarding the stonemason.

01:52:17.445 --> 01:52:22.735
I want a double accommodation
for Robbo and his pal John.

01:52:23.617 --> 01:52:26.322
Not singles. You got a family-size?

01:52:27.788 --> 01:52:29.117
What do you got?

01:52:30.291 --> 01:52:34.040
No. Wait, what was that last one?

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.797
I like it. Oh, I like it.

01:52:40.468 --> 01:52:42.425
Prepare. Prepare.

01:52:43.679 --> 01:52:46.300
Everything will be all right.

01:52:46.682 --> 01:52:49.173
I'm curious, Mr. Gisborne.

01:52:50.478 --> 01:52:54.476
- Always Guy.
- You must give me the details.

01:52:54.982 --> 01:53:00.652
Can we find a more comfortable place
where we could talk? A couch?

01:53:00.821 --> 01:53:02.731
How will you kill them?

01:53:02.949 --> 01:53:07.657
That is a professional secret.
You can understand that.

01:53:07.870 --> 01:53:12.413
You can tell me. We are
going into business together.

01:53:12.625 --> 01:53:15.994
So we'll find a soft location
and have a conference.

01:53:16.754 --> 01:53:19.459
Would you prefer, Cointreau or brandy?

01:53:20.633 --> 01:53:22.672
Anything is fine.

01:53:23.261 --> 01:53:27.757
But first, you must
tell me all about it.

01:53:29.517 --> 01:53:30.976
Guysie.

01:53:31.185 --> 01:53:34.270
Guysie? Guysie?

01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:37.229
I'll tell you everything.

01:53:37.858 --> 01:53:39.732
Hey, you got it.

01:53:42.405 --> 01:53:44.196
Oh, but you forgot the rest.

01:54:01.716 --> 01:54:03.210
My dear friends...

01:54:03.676 --> 01:54:08.717
...when I came to this country
54 years ago, I had nothing...

01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:14.467
...but the heritage of six
generations of pretzel benders.

01:54:14.812 --> 01:54:20.103
Now I had made up my mind
to make a fortune in America.

01:54:20.859 --> 01:54:25.735
I knew that I had to do more
than just make another pretzel.

01:54:25.907 --> 01:54:30.070
So I deliberated and deliberated...

01:54:30.244 --> 01:54:34.574
...until I came up
with the solution known...

01:54:34.791 --> 01:54:39.037
...around the world as
the Hammacher twist.

01:54:39.253 --> 01:54:43.085
Twice as much pretzel in one pretzel.

01:54:47.094 --> 01:54:48.968
What's holding Guy?

01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:54.257
I'll tell you,
That crane's holding him up.

01:54:54.477 --> 01:54:57.762
He made one mistake:
he tried to do it alone.

01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:59.772
So you can shoot from the navel.

01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:04.816
- You got 48 hours to clear out.
- Carry the bags, fat boy.

01:55:05.029 --> 01:55:10.071
And now, my dear friends,
I invite everybody inside the bar.

01:55:10.451 --> 01:55:12.408
The schnapps is on Hammacher.

01:55:12.620 --> 01:55:15.111
Shouldn't we have one for Gisborne?

01:55:15.289 --> 01:55:18.955
Didn't we give him a short beer?

01:55:22.046 --> 01:55:25.462
- Please don't take my cocoa.
- Yes, sir.

01:55:29.178 --> 01:55:31.799
- Liqueur in the drawing room.
- Thanks.

01:55:34.183 --> 01:55:37.137
I am confident you've
arranged everything.

01:55:37.312 --> 01:55:41.475
I've rented the auditorium...

01:55:41.649 --> 01:55:45.267
...contacted the necessary parties
and found painters.

01:55:45.486 --> 01:55:47.858
We can't afford any slip-ups.

01:55:48.572 --> 01:55:52.072
When Robbo says 48 hours,
he doesn't mean 49.

01:55:52.285 --> 01:55:54.823
T omorrow will tell the tale.

01:55:55.872 --> 01:56:01.162
T omorrow is in the hands of fate,
but tonight is all ours.

01:56:02.336 --> 01:56:04.329
Oh, I agree.

01:56:05.172 --> 01:56:10.511
I don't know what you're going
to do with your part of it.

01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:12.179
I'm going to sleep.

01:56:12.346 --> 01:56:15.929
- Miss Stevens?
- Good night.

01:56:16.142 --> 01:56:18.099
Your hat and coat, sir.

01:56:19.854 --> 01:56:21.348
Good night.

01:56:21.564 --> 01:56:22.892
Ta-ta.

01:56:23.524 --> 01:56:25.268
Ta-ta to you too.

01:56:25.609 --> 01:56:28.183
- This way out-
- I know the way!

01:56:38.039 --> 01:56:41.372
Are you content
to raise your children...

01:56:41.542 --> 01:56:44.993
- ... in a city run by gangsters?
- No!

01:56:45.212 --> 01:56:49.459
Will you let your sons
idolize this phony Robin Hood...

01:56:49.675 --> 01:56:53.922
...who uses soup kitchens to
print counterfeit money?

01:56:54.138 --> 01:56:56.012
No!

01:56:56.223 --> 01:57:00.719
Thank you. Now I would
like to introduce a man who...

01:57:00.937 --> 01:57:03.771
...is dedicated to public service.

01:57:03.981 --> 01:57:06.733
A great officer of the law.

01:57:06.901 --> 01:57:09.273
The man who will lead us...

01:57:09.487 --> 01:57:12.274
...in our fight for
better government...

01:57:12.490 --> 01:57:15.195
...Deputy Sheriff Alvin Potts.

01:57:24.752 --> 01:57:26.791
Thank you, Miss Stevens.

01:57:27.713 --> 01:57:31.663
May I say that I
whole-heartedly support...

01:57:31.842 --> 01:57:34.084
...the Women's League
for Better Government?

01:57:51.737 --> 01:57:53.813
Once a hood, always a hood.

01:57:54.031 --> 01:57:56.902
Those with pride
in the soup kitchens...

01:57:57.117 --> 01:58:00.119
...were shocked to find the
kitchens were fronts...

01:58:00.287 --> 01:58:03.787
...for a large counterfeiting ring.

01:58:03.958 --> 01:58:08.370
The leopard, it seems,
cannot change his spots.

01:58:10.798 --> 01:58:15.625
Read all about it!
Robin Hood a hood!

01:58:19.432 --> 01:58:22.302
Paper? I always knew he was a hood.

01:58:23.185 --> 01:58:25.641
I must talk to Mr. Jake.

01:58:25.813 --> 01:58:29.182
- You knit one and you purl two.
- Okay.

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:32.816
Otherwise you drop
a stitch, you know-

01:58:32.987 --> 01:58:37.316
I insist on talking
to Mr. Jake. Y es.

01:58:37.575 --> 01:58:39.117
Give me that.

01:58:39.702 --> 01:58:44.163
I don't want any trouble
with you bums down there.

01:58:44.332 --> 01:58:47.333
Go clean up that soup kitchen.

01:58:48.002 --> 01:58:50.160
We run a charity.

01:58:50.671 --> 01:58:55.547
I can't work for two bosses.
That dame called this morning...

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:00.801
...and she said not to stop,
and not take orders from nobody.

01:59:06.937 --> 01:59:09.096
Everybody against the wall.

01:59:09.315 --> 01:59:11.937
Hello. Hello!

01:59:17.281 --> 01:59:22.073
He hung up on me. Let's go down
there, make a few ripples.

01:59:35.424 --> 01:59:38.378
- Holy mackerel!
- Those little-

01:59:38.552 --> 01:59:40.628
Close it and lock it.

01:59:41.722 --> 01:59:43.798
You're gonna let them do that?

01:59:44.016 --> 01:59:47.931
I can fight hoods or cops,
but not the people.

01:59:49.813 --> 01:59:51.355
Me first.

01:59:54.401 --> 01:59:56.524
I forgot my knitting.

02:00:00.241 --> 02:00:01.735
Oh, dear.

02:00:14.254 --> 02:00:18.169
Merry Christmas! Thank you!

02:00:18.384 --> 02:00:21.835
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!

02:00:24.724 --> 02:00:28.935
Ho, ho. Merry Christmas, thank you.

02:00:30.271 --> 02:00:33.805
- Let's get coffee.
- Let's see if the boss wants any.

02:00:36.527 --> 02:00:40.607
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas!

02:00:44.243 --> 02:00:46.319
How about some coffee?

02:00:46.537 --> 02:00:49.455
- I'm treating.
- Where'd you get the money?

02:00:49.707 --> 02:00:53.456
- Some guy missed the bucket.
- Follow me.

02:00:58.466 --> 02:01:00.708
Ain't that the dame's outfit?

02:01:00.926 --> 02:01:03.464
Yeah, "WLBG. "

02:01:04.180 --> 02:01:07.964
- They must be doing good.
- Yeah, come on.

02:01:26.202 --> 02:01:28.325
Happy Yuletide, gentlemen.

02:01:30.873 --> 02:01:33.364
This wet snow infuriates me...

02:01:33.584 --> 02:01:37.167
...but I can't wear galoshes
with evening clothes.

02:01:41.842 --> 02:01:43.669
Why, that dirty-

02:01:43.886 --> 02:01:47.469
Hey, we blow this job,
we won't have a pot.

02:01:47.682 --> 02:01:52.344
- What happened to Potts?
- He must be in there.

02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:56.142
Happy Yuletide, Mr. Potts.

02:01:57.305 --> 02:02:03.738
