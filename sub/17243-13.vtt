WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:07.038
Heavy panting

00:07.063 --> 00:10.765
(Footsteps pound, huffing and puffing)

00:10.790 --> 00:16.018
(Huffing and puffing)

00:16.053 --> 00:18.187
(Huffing and puffing)

00:18.353 --> 00:20.121
(Birds chirp, cicadas drone)

00:20.473 --> 00:22.773
(Door bursts open and bangs shut)

00:22.808 --> 00:24.976
(Gasping for breath)

00:30.219 --> 00:33.584
(Claps)

00:33.619 --> 00:35.185
(Tries to speak but can't)

00:35.220 --> 00:36.988
(Gasping for breath)

00:40.817 --> 00:44.991
We're getting out! (Panting)

00:45.015 --> 00:48.027
We're finally getting out!
(Hysterical high-pitched laugh)

00:48.061 --> 00:50.185
- Alexis: (Laughs unsurely)
- David: Oh my God.

00:50.593 --> 00:52.264
I mean it!

00:52.289 --> 00:55.184
Alexis and Moira: (Shriek excitedly)

00:55.218 --> 00:57.686
(High-pitched laugh)

00:57.720 --> 00:59.554
- Alexis: (Laughs and shrieks)
- David: Oh my-oh my God!

00:59.589 --> 01:01.323
Oh my God!

01:01.358 --> 01:02.830
Moira: (Bawling) Johnny...

01:02.855 --> 01:08.191
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -

01:08.269 --> 01:10.137
Johnny: Told you I'd sell
this town. Didn't I tell you?

01:10.171 --> 01:11.538
David: Yes. Not to diminish
your accomplishment,

01:11.572 --> 01:13.721
but you did say that a handful of times.

01:13.746 --> 01:15.247
I think eight, to be exact.

01:15.282 --> 01:16.781
It bears repeating.

01:16.815 --> 01:18.666
Alexis: My little suity-cases! Oh!

01:18.691 --> 01:20.874
Moira: David? Should I take this with me?

01:20.908 --> 01:23.009
If I'm being perfectly
honest, it's very low

01:23.043 --> 01:25.011
on the totem pole of coats
of yours that I like, but-

01:25.045 --> 01:26.045
Moira: It was a gift from your father.

01:26.080 --> 01:27.781
Hey, that's a good coat.

01:27.815 --> 01:30.650
I outbid Richard Branson for
it at the Kiminski auction.

01:30.685 --> 01:34.120
Moira: I did get sick of having
hot coffee and blood thrown at me.

01:34.154 --> 01:37.222
You know who covets this coat? Jocelyn.

01:37.256 --> 01:39.124
I could bestow it upon
her as a parting gift.

01:39.158 --> 01:41.126
We may want to put pen to paper

01:41.160 --> 01:43.496
before we start giving away
designer clothing, sweetheart.

01:43.530 --> 01:46.131
It would be her first piece of clothing

01:46.165 --> 01:49.896
made outside of mainland
China. I'm gonna do it.

01:49.921 --> 01:52.904
Alexis: Honestly, I cannot
wait to get to the beach.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.507
- David: What?
- Alexis: Yeah, I'm going to St. Barts

01:54.541 --> 01:57.175
with Jenna, Leisha, and...

01:57.210 --> 01:58.443
Some other girl with an "ah" name

01:58.478 --> 02:00.612
that I can't quite remember.

02:00.646 --> 02:03.248
- David: Huh.
- Alexis: Why? What are you doing?

02:03.282 --> 02:06.547
David: Well, I'm gonna go to New
York and um... see some people.

02:06.572 --> 02:08.363
Alexis: Oh! What people?

02:08.388 --> 02:10.720
You don't know them. Just people.

02:10.745 --> 02:13.625
I thought everyone just kind
of dropped you like flies

02:13.659 --> 02:16.860
when you couldn't pick up the
tab at the Waverly anymore?

02:16.895 --> 02:18.844
Well, that's absolutely not true.

02:18.869 --> 02:21.332
I just have a different kind
of relationship with my friends

02:21.366 --> 02:22.766
where we don't need to be in
constant contact with each other.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.963
Alexis: Okay.

02:24.988 --> 02:29.229
You should um... come to
New York after you're done.

02:29.254 --> 02:32.743
And do what, eat a cronut
at a Brooklyn flea market?

02:32.777 --> 02:36.113
Well, I was thinking
maybe we could get a...

02:36.148 --> 02:38.748
A two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan

02:38.782 --> 02:41.065
and not have to live in Brooklyn.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.754
Honestly, David, and like no offense,

02:44.788 --> 02:46.722
but when I get out of here,
I'm gonna get my own place

02:46.757 --> 02:49.554
so I can pack how I wanna pack

02:49.579 --> 02:52.174
and I don't have to be called
a circus freak all the time.

02:57.047 --> 02:58.380
Moira: Ding-dong.

02:58.414 --> 03:00.649
Jocelyn: Moira, hey!
Moira: Hi, Jocelyn.

03:00.684 --> 03:02.885
Gosh, you look so glamorous today.

03:02.919 --> 03:04.620
Oh, thank you. Some days it just works.

03:04.654 --> 03:06.321
Yeah. (Laughs)

03:06.356 --> 03:08.818
So I guess you heard the news.

03:08.843 --> 03:10.325
I heard there was someone
interested in buying...

03:10.360 --> 03:12.027
Yes, we're leaving.

03:12.061 --> 03:13.161
I didn't know it was finalized.

03:13.196 --> 03:14.864
And since we're leaving...

03:14.898 --> 03:17.665
dear God it feels good to be saying that!

03:17.700 --> 03:19.567
I would like to give you this

03:19.602 --> 03:22.037
as a little keepsake to remember me by.

03:22.071 --> 03:23.571
Wow.

03:25.508 --> 03:27.175
Is-is it a wig?

03:27.210 --> 03:32.867
No. It's a coat. It's the coat.

03:33.265 --> 03:34.682
What coat?

03:34.717 --> 03:37.218
The coat you kept going
on about that one time.

03:37.252 --> 03:38.986
Are you sure it was me?

03:39.021 --> 03:41.433
Oh, it's absolutely tragic, Jocelyn,

03:41.458 --> 03:45.027
that I will never see or
speak to you ever again.

03:45.052 --> 03:47.061
- Jocelyn: Well...
- Moira: But I will have my memories

03:47.095 --> 03:50.631
and you will have this incredible coat.

03:50.665 --> 03:53.100
Goodbye, dear friend.

03:53.135 --> 03:54.935
Goodbye, Moira Rose.

03:54.969 --> 03:56.570
(Car rumbles by)

03:56.604 --> 03:58.538
Ted: Hey! What're you doing here?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.007
- Alexis: Um, can I... ?
- Ted: Yeah, yeah, come on in.

04:01.042 --> 04:03.076
(Cat meows, dogs bark, phone rings)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.313
- Alexis: Hey.
- Ted: Hey.

04:07.348 --> 04:12.125
Um... so big news. We've sold the town.

04:13.047 --> 04:15.955
- Ted: Wow. O-okay, and...
- Alexis: And we're leaving.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.257
We're leaving?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.469
Well, me and my family are leaving.

04:22.140 --> 04:23.495
Oh.

04:23.844 --> 04:26.131
Yeah...

04:26.166 --> 04:28.605
Oh. Okay.

04:28.630 --> 04:31.113
Well, in that case then, um, here,

04:31.138 --> 04:34.139
there's something that I need to show you.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.908
Alexis: Okay.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.613
(Flustered) Uh...

04:38.638 --> 04:41.946
Originally, we were gonna be on an
all-inclusive vacation when I did this...

04:41.980 --> 04:44.014
What's an all-inclusive vacation?

04:49.721 --> 04:52.693
(Gasps)

04:52.718 --> 04:57.027
Alexis Claire Rose... Will you marry me?

04:57.062 --> 04:58.629
(Hesitating) Uh... uh...

05:04.135 --> 05:06.637
Yes!

05:08.640 --> 05:11.437
If I was staying, then yes!

05:11.462 --> 05:13.978
A thousand times, yes!

05:14.003 --> 05:16.947
And if things were different
and I wasn't leaving,

05:16.982 --> 05:20.717
um, then definitely yes!

05:20.751 --> 05:24.399
So... is that a no?

05:24.424 --> 05:26.155
Yes... ?

05:28.225 --> 05:29.158
(Box snaps shut)

05:29.192 --> 05:32.161
(Birds chirp)

05:32.195 --> 05:34.396
(Bag thumps)

05:34.431 --> 05:36.966
Stevie: Are you stealing Roland's truck?

05:37.001 --> 05:39.735
Yeah. It's not exactly a Tesla,

05:39.769 --> 05:43.138
but it'll get our bags to the airport.

05:43.172 --> 05:44.372
So you wanted to see me?

05:44.406 --> 05:48.051
Yeah. I had an idea.

05:48.076 --> 05:50.779
Oh-oh.

05:50.813 --> 05:54.783
What if you came with me to New York?

05:54.817 --> 05:57.118
- Stevie: (Laughing) What?
- David: Yeah.

05:57.152 --> 05:58.485
Are you ser... really?

05:58.520 --> 06:01.388
Mm-hmm.

06:01.422 --> 06:03.613
- Stevie: New York?!
- David: Yeah.

06:05.527 --> 06:07.361
I don't even know what I would do there.

06:07.395 --> 06:08.763
Oh, you just watch a season of "Girls"

06:08.797 --> 06:13.868
and do the opposite of
what they do. It's easy.

06:13.902 --> 06:16.302
You have this like whole life there,

06:16.336 --> 06:19.005
with all these fancy friends...

06:19.040 --> 06:21.141
Who, in my head, at
least all dress like you,

06:21.175 --> 06:23.143
and I feel like I'd get lost in the mix.

06:23.177 --> 06:24.918
Mm-hmm.

06:24.943 --> 06:31.410
Well, all of my friends will
probably be away for the summer

06:31.435 --> 06:34.187
and I have found a really beautiful
two-bedroom in the East Village.

06:34.221 --> 06:35.821
It's beautiful, so...

06:35.855 --> 06:38.223
Oh, two bedroom.

06:38.257 --> 06:39.758
Yeah. I mean, I was
looking at three bedrooms,

06:39.793 --> 06:42.094
but do I really need an
office? I don't... I don't know.

06:42.128 --> 06:45.964
Yeah... right.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.801
You're coming! You're coming to New York!

06:48.835 --> 06:50.969
Pack a bag. Pack two bags.

06:51.004 --> 06:53.072
- How many bags do you have?
- Stevie: (Laughs dryly)

06:53.106 --> 06:55.768
I'm saving you from this dumpy town.

06:57.822 --> 06:59.823
See you soon!

06:59.848 --> 07:01.688
(Music plays quietly,
dishes and cutlery clank)

07:03.949 --> 07:05.518
Johnny: Oh, Twyla...

07:05.543 --> 07:08.152
Twyla: Oh, hey, Mr. Rose. I
heard you guys were leaving.

07:08.187 --> 07:10.689
Johnny: Yes, yes, we are,

07:10.723 --> 07:13.057
and I just wanted to thank you for all
the great service over the past few months.

07:13.092 --> 07:15.026
You're welcome.

07:15.060 --> 07:18.395
Yeah, judging by your tips,
I was never really sure.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.976
Oh. I'll have a coffee
when you get a minute.

07:21.352 --> 07:23.180
(Door opens and closes)

07:24.302 --> 07:27.571
Roland: Johnny, I gotta talk to you.

07:27.606 --> 07:32.276
Listen, uh... I don't wanna
piss in your punch bowl, okay,

07:32.310 --> 07:36.446
but um... I got a bad feeling about
this buyer guy of yours, Andy...

07:36.480 --> 07:38.181
- Johnny: Roberts. Right, right.
- Roland: Roberts.

07:38.216 --> 07:41.274
Very successful. His family made
a fortune in the shelving business.

07:41.299 --> 07:42.915
Okay, fine. Um...

07:42.940 --> 07:46.429
He called me while he was
bumping uglies with this old lady.

07:46.454 --> 07:48.424
Oh no, really?

07:48.459 --> 07:50.794
But that's not the problem. The problem
is he put me on the speaker phone.

07:50.828 --> 07:52.376
I mean, who would do such a thing?

07:52.401 --> 07:53.696
I mean, that's something you would do.

07:53.731 --> 07:54.964
- As soon as he put me on his speakerphone,
- Johnny: No, no,

07:54.998 --> 07:55.798
- Roland: I thought of you.
- Johnny: That's not something...

07:55.832 --> 07:57.600
and I can't deal with another you.

07:57.635 --> 07:59.602
But-but-but don't worry, 'cause...

07:59.637 --> 08:01.203
- Roland: Well, I am worried!
- Johnny: It'll be fine. Roland.

08:01.238 --> 08:03.473
- Roland: This is the guy who's gonna buy the town?
- Johnny: Just relax.

08:03.507 --> 08:05.475
Man: (Obnoxious laughter)
Yeah, and here's the kicker...

08:05.509 --> 08:08.144
The second one was a hooker too!

08:08.178 --> 08:10.146
(Laughs) Yeah, yeah. Okay, see ya. See ya.

08:10.180 --> 08:11.813
Excuse me, honey,

08:11.847 --> 08:13.282
do you know where I can find Johnny Rose?

08:13.316 --> 08:16.151
I got a meeting with this freakin' douche.

08:16.185 --> 08:18.820
Roland: (Coughs) The
douchebag is right here.

08:23.426 --> 08:24.760
(Clears throat)

08:24.794 --> 08:28.129
(Birds chirp, rollers rattle)

08:30.999 --> 08:34.253
So... you're leaving.

08:34.936 --> 08:37.004
What'd Ted say about that?

08:37.038 --> 08:40.789
Uh... he proposed.

08:40.815 --> 08:42.809
Really.

08:42.844 --> 08:44.786
So what'd you tell him?

08:44.811 --> 08:46.426
I told him I was leaving.

08:46.451 --> 08:48.044
But if you weren't, you would?

08:48.069 --> 08:50.592
'Kay, is this a Barbara
Walter special or something?

08:50.617 --> 08:52.990
I'm leaving. That's it.

08:54.087 --> 08:56.122
You don't seem to be crying about it.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.525
Mutt: I think it's nice you're
going back to your natural habitat.

08:58.559 --> 09:01.528
I'm not a dolphin, Mutt.

09:01.562 --> 09:05.332
You know what I meant. I'm happy for you.

09:05.366 --> 09:09.167
Oh. I'm glad you're happy about it.

09:09.202 --> 09:10.736
You know, you should really work on

09:10.770 --> 09:12.938
expanding your emotional
range at some point.

09:12.972 --> 09:15.941
(Roller bangs against building)

09:15.975 --> 09:17.909
(Loud obnoxious laughter)

09:17.944 --> 09:20.464
Roland: So what you're saying is,
he got a little short with you?

09:20.479 --> 09:25.297
Andy and Roland: (Uproarious laughter)

09:26.152 --> 09:28.854
Johnny: You, uh, you weren't
quite seeing eye to eye?

09:28.888 --> 09:31.923
- Johnny: (Chuckles)
- Roland and Andy: (Silence)

09:31.958 --> 09:34.292
Andy: So, are we gonna
sign this puppy or what?

09:34.327 --> 09:36.794
Johnny: Oh, there's a good idea!

09:36.829 --> 09:40.231
Andy, I've got the bill of sale right here,

09:40.265 --> 09:44.101
and... if you wanna put your John
Hancock right there on that first tab-

09:44.135 --> 09:45.936
Roland: Whoa-Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba.

09:45.971 --> 09:48.594
Hold on a second here. I
think I got a better idea.

09:48.619 --> 09:50.575
- Andy: What's that?
- Roland: Why don't you come over to the house tonight

09:50.609 --> 09:52.510
and try some of Jocelyn's
famous mac and cheese.

09:52.544 --> 09:55.380
We can sign this then.

09:55.414 --> 09:58.582
- Andy: And cheese...
- Johnny: Or... or we can sign it now,

09:58.616 --> 10:01.651
and then we can dive
into some mac and cheese.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.353
- Right here, Andy.
- I... I love it.

10:03.388 --> 10:05.856
You know, I could really
use a good home-cooked meal.

10:05.890 --> 10:08.792
Well, right after we
sign, we can all have one.

10:08.826 --> 10:11.528
Andy: And according to Roland
here, Jocelyn's hot stuff.

10:11.562 --> 10:13.096
I can't leave town without meeting her.

10:13.130 --> 10:15.265
But then again, if she's that hot

10:15.299 --> 10:16.867
what's she doing with this guy?

10:16.901 --> 10:19.202
(Uproarious laughter)

10:19.236 --> 10:20.937
I can't help it if she's got taste!

10:20.971 --> 10:22.939
Andy: Oh yeah, right. Yeah, taste. Yeah.

10:22.973 --> 10:24.941
Roland and Andy: (Laughing uproariously)

10:24.975 --> 10:28.011
Johnny: (Feigned laughter peters out)

10:30.014 --> 10:31.014
(Birds chirp)

10:33.083 --> 10:35.785
(Stamping forcefully)

10:35.819 --> 10:38.087
Well, excuse you in that coat!

10:38.122 --> 10:41.156
I know! Jocelyn gave it to me.

10:41.190 --> 10:44.793
What?! Knock-off's are
getting so good these days.

10:44.827 --> 10:47.095
Thanks. I can't wait till winter.

10:47.130 --> 10:51.466
I'm gonna feel like Patty LaBelle.

10:51.500 --> 10:54.602
So you did good work, princess.

10:54.637 --> 10:56.638
- Alexis: Thank you.
- Ronnie: Yeah.

10:56.672 --> 11:00.708
Perfect attendance,
nothing but glowing reviews.

11:00.743 --> 11:04.725
And you must have done
a some number on Mutt.

11:04.750 --> 11:07.014
What do you mean?

11:07.049 --> 11:11.319
His hours were up a month
ago, he kept coming anyway.

11:11.353 --> 11:13.822
- Alexis: What?
- Ronnie: Yeah, maybe he just got bored...

11:13.856 --> 11:19.637
Or maybe he just likes
pretty girls in hippy hats.

11:20.126 --> 11:22.868
Know what I mean, string bean?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.001
David: (Frustrated sigh)

11:29.871 --> 11:32.806
Stevie: That's a lot of bags.

11:32.841 --> 11:35.640
David: There's still some space
for you though, so don't worry!

11:37.412 --> 11:41.780
Stevie: Yeah... so, um, about New York.

11:42.317 --> 11:45.718
Uh, it sounds amazing,
but I can't do it, so...

11:48.116 --> 11:51.692
Wha-what-what-? Why? What?

11:51.726 --> 11:55.380
Uh, I don't think we're on the same page

11:55.405 --> 11:58.264
with what going to New York means.

11:58.299 --> 12:03.217
Okay. What does it...
does it mean... something?

12:03.270 --> 12:04.838
Ugh...

12:06.840 --> 12:11.577
(Sighs) I like you.

12:11.612 --> 12:14.780
I don't want to like you but I do...

12:14.815 --> 12:18.518
And so sharing a space
with you as roommates

12:18.552 --> 12:20.487
isn't gonna work for me.

12:20.521 --> 12:27.059
Um... so I'm gonna take a pass, but um...

12:27.084 --> 12:28.594
I'm sure you have a lot of friends

12:28.629 --> 12:30.663
who would love to live with you.

12:30.697 --> 12:32.999
Yeah, not as many as you'd think, so...

12:33.033 --> 12:36.051
Um... okay.

12:37.137 --> 12:40.006
Well, thank you for being honest and um...

12:40.040 --> 12:44.744
I wish I could fix this situation.

12:45.744 --> 12:48.524
Um... you've been a great friend.

12:48.549 --> 12:54.041
You've been my o-only friend,
so... great, nevertheless.

12:54.854 --> 12:58.290
Um... you've made my life here survivable.

12:58.324 --> 13:01.260
Survivable. Thank-thank you.

13:01.294 --> 13:04.678
That is the nicest thing
anyone has ever said to me.

13:06.866 --> 13:11.336
David: So now I'm gonna go
back to New York... by myself

13:11.371 --> 13:14.725
and um... and you can just stay here then.

13:16.029 --> 13:19.610
(Shaky exhale) Yeah.

13:19.644 --> 13:22.262
I think that's... That's how it has to be.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.966
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:26.991 --> 13:28.258
(Sniffs)

13:31.129 --> 13:32.990
Stevie: Okay, bye.

13:33.024 --> 13:35.493
(Receding footsteps)

13:39.064 --> 13:41.498
(Sniffs and sighs)

13:44.821 --> 13:47.364
Andy: (Mouth full) Yeah,
my granddad... (Chewing)

13:47.389 --> 13:48.986
Opened our family's first shelf factory

13:49.020 --> 13:50.921
in a small town just like this one.

13:50.956 --> 13:54.616
I tell you, this place is
bursting with opportunity.

13:55.426 --> 13:58.695
Well, bursting seems to
be the operative word.

13:58.730 --> 14:01.998
- Andy: Mm! So good!
- Roland: Whoa! Slow down there, pal!

14:02.032 --> 14:05.134
We got dinner coming
and a big desert after...

14:05.169 --> 14:06.102
- Andy: Oh.
- Roland: Sex in a pan.

14:06.136 --> 14:08.171
Andy: Oh?

14:08.205 --> 14:09.105
Roland: Then we'll have dessert!

14:09.139 --> 14:12.408
(Laughing boisterously)

14:12.442 --> 14:15.478
I love it! This guy's
a prince. He's a prince!

14:15.512 --> 14:19.415
So... did you try it on?

14:19.449 --> 14:20.750
- Jocelyn: What?
- Moira: The coat.

14:20.784 --> 14:22.118
The one I gave you.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.720
(Lying) Yes. It's... it's great.

14:24.755 --> 14:26.221
- Moira: Not too snug?
- Jocelyn: Nope.

14:26.256 --> 14:27.719
Buttoned right up.

14:27.744 --> 14:29.892
It zips.

14:29.926 --> 14:33.313
Jocelyn: Zips. It zipped right up!

14:34.211 --> 14:36.680
Moira: You didn't try it on, did you?

14:36.705 --> 14:38.954
Jocelyn: No. Moira: Oh, why not?

14:38.979 --> 14:43.772
It's a great coat! At
least let us see it on you.

14:43.806 --> 14:46.408
(Fridge door slams) I gave it away.

14:46.442 --> 14:49.144
I'm sorry.

14:49.178 --> 14:53.748
It just... it didn't suit me
and... I thought about Ronnie

14:53.783 --> 14:56.118
and you know she could always use some
more feminine pieces in her wardrobe,

14:56.152 --> 14:57.852
and so I took it over to
her and she really liked it,

14:57.887 --> 15:01.447
so I paid it... forward.

15:02.658 --> 15:04.526
Moira: Well, Jocelyn, there are...

15:04.560 --> 15:07.061
certain things that are just not done:

15:07.095 --> 15:10.276
Smoking in a car with a baby,
unless you crack a window;

15:10.301 --> 15:14.580
tipping before tax;
mixing drinks with cola;

15:14.605 --> 15:17.739
and giving away a coat
that doesn't belong to you.

15:17.773 --> 15:19.441
(Birds chirp, chopping sound)

15:21.644 --> 15:23.210
(Knock at the door) It's open.

15:23.245 --> 15:26.539
(Door creaks open)

15:26.564 --> 15:31.031
Alexis: Hey. Um... I just came to say...

15:31.056 --> 15:34.922
That we'll be leaving as soon
as the sale's signed, so...

15:34.956 --> 15:36.457
Mutt: You must be super excited.

15:36.491 --> 15:40.060
Alexis: Yeah.

15:40.094 --> 15:43.163
Why did you do all that
extra community service, Mutt?

15:43.197 --> 15:44.832
Mutt: Extra community service?

15:44.857 --> 15:49.703
Alexis: Ronnie said that your
hours ended a long time ago, so...

15:49.737 --> 15:51.203
I like to stay active.

15:51.237 --> 15:52.972
Alexis: Really?

15:53.006 --> 15:54.442
Mutt: What do you want me to say?

15:54.467 --> 15:58.310
Alexis: Well, could it maybe be
because of the fact that you...

15:58.345 --> 16:00.212
Enjoy my company?

16:00.246 --> 16:02.348
Sure.

16:02.382 --> 16:03.683
Don't you even care that I'm leaving?

16:03.717 --> 16:05.518
Of course I care.

16:05.552 --> 16:07.119
- Alexis: Then what're you doing?
- Mutt: Why are you yelling?

16:07.153 --> 16:09.573
Okay, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

16:09.598 --> 16:13.959
Mutt, why did you do that
extra community service?

16:13.994 --> 16:15.160
(Whispers gruffly) You know why!

16:15.195 --> 16:17.229
Why can't you just say it?

16:19.987 --> 16:22.134
(Feet scuffle)

16:22.168 --> 16:24.736
(Passionate kissing)

16:30.058 --> 16:32.677
Roland: What a lovely surprise!
Come on in. How are ya?

16:32.712 --> 16:34.152
I'm just wondering if my dad is here.

16:34.179 --> 16:35.339
Roland: Yeah, your dad's here.

16:35.347 --> 16:37.181
Uh, Johnny?

16:37.216 --> 16:39.550
Your kid's here.

16:45.190 --> 16:46.790
- Jocelyn: Does he wanna come in?
- Roland: I don't think so.

16:46.825 --> 16:49.827
Jocelyn: He doesn't wanna come in, okay.

16:49.861 --> 16:51.862
David, what're you doing here?

16:51.897 --> 16:53.797
I'm just wondering when you think
we're gonna have the check ready?

16:53.832 --> 16:55.099
Well, this is not the time for that, David.

16:55.134 --> 16:56.934
Okay, well, you gave
me this town as a gift,

16:56.968 --> 16:58.903
so I feel like I'm owed a little bit more.

16:58.937 --> 17:01.805
So fifty percent for me,
fifty percent for you.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.741
David, I'm in the middle
of something important.

17:03.775 --> 17:06.410
Well, if I'm gonna be going
to New York, by myself,

17:06.444 --> 17:08.478
then I'm gonna need a
little bit more money.

17:08.512 --> 17:09.646
- Johnny: Well, that's not gonna happen.
- David: Well, it has to happen.

17:09.681 --> 17:10.247
- Johnny: It's not gonna happen.
- David: Well, it has to...

17:10.281 --> 17:11.982
Talk to the hand, son,

17:12.017 --> 17:14.585
because I've got to watch a pig eat.

17:17.955 --> 17:20.335
(Door opens and closes)

17:22.526 --> 17:24.928
Moira: What did David want?

17:24.962 --> 17:28.263
As owner of the town, he wants half.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.034
- I tell you, Joc, this freakin' delicious! Mm!
- Everyone's so greedy.

17:31.068 --> 17:33.269
Jocelyn: Well, let me take your plates.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.137
Andy: Okay, good.

17:35.172 --> 17:36.573
Johnny: There you go.

17:36.607 --> 17:40.076
Jocelyn: Um, Andy, you look a little dewy.

17:40.110 --> 17:42.211
- Andy: Oh.
- Jocelyn: I'll get you some fresh coffee.

17:42.245 --> 17:44.447
Andy: Oh, good idea.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.549
Is it just me or is it this dessert

17:46.583 --> 17:48.350
that's-that's making me horny?

17:48.385 --> 17:50.553
(Laughing)

17:50.587 --> 17:51.753
Johnny: I think it's just you, Andy.

17:51.788 --> 17:53.956
- Andy: Oh.
- Roland: You know what?

17:53.990 --> 17:56.358
I think I should let you guys do the nasty.

17:56.393 --> 17:58.294
(Clears his throat) And
then sign the contract!

17:58.328 --> 18:01.496
(Laughing) Andy: You! This guy! This guy!

18:01.530 --> 18:03.098
Johnny: Oh, he's a prince, isn't he?

18:03.132 --> 18:05.433
Andy: Yeah, he's a prince. Yup.

18:05.468 --> 18:10.747
Johnny: Okay, well... I think
you are getting bargain...

18:10.772 --> 18:12.140
- Andy: Really?
- Johnny: With this, Andy.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.558
And to make things easy,

18:14.583 --> 18:18.767
I'm going to uh... Put
my signature down first.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.415
How 'bout that?

18:20.449 --> 18:23.818
Andy: $975,000 dollars! Wow.

18:23.852 --> 18:25.352
That's a heck of a lot of cheddar!

18:25.386 --> 18:27.888
Don't you think so, sweet cheeks?

18:27.923 --> 18:30.057
Sweet cheeks? Aren't you
the old fashioned charmer.

18:30.092 --> 18:32.226
Oh! Rrrow! (Laughs)

18:32.260 --> 18:34.561
Ready for your signature, Andy.

18:34.596 --> 18:37.131
Drum roll please.

18:37.165 --> 18:39.934
You know, Andy, $975,000

18:39.968 --> 18:42.202
suddenly seems like such a girly number.

18:42.237 --> 18:43.637
What are we doing, honey?

18:43.671 --> 18:48.242
I mean, a million...
That's bold, that's sexy.

18:48.276 --> 18:50.196
Andy: That's quite the
little lady you have there.

18:50.211 --> 18:53.913
(Lecherous moan)

18:53.948 --> 18:56.016
You know, I think the little lady's right.

18:56.050 --> 18:57.884
What's an extra $25,000, Andy?

18:57.918 --> 18:59.919
Come on, it's chump change.

18:59.954 --> 19:04.324
It's cab fare. $25,000? For you?

19:04.359 --> 19:07.393
Come on. You can cough it up.

19:07.427 --> 19:09.387
All right, let's call it
a million! What the heck!

19:09.396 --> 19:10.630
Johnny and Moira: (Quietly) Yes! Yes!

19:10.664 --> 19:12.865
Andy: (Laughs uproariously)

19:12.899 --> 19:15.034
- Johnny: There we go!
- Andy: (Moans strangely)

19:15.068 --> 19:18.904
Johnny: Just initial and
sign on the dotted line.

19:18.938 --> 19:20.406
- Andy: (Moans)
- Johnny: Sign on...

19:20.440 --> 19:22.141
What's happening? What?

19:22.176 --> 19:24.910
Oh my God! Andy! Andy! (Andy moans)

19:24.944 --> 19:27.045
We had him, we had him. We had...

19:27.079 --> 19:29.947
Moira: Okay, put the pen in his
hand. Sign! He was going to sign.

19:29.982 --> 19:31.149
- Johnny: Here we go, here we go.
- Moira: He was going to sign!

19:31.184 --> 19:33.084
- Moira: You, sign!
- Johnny: Andy?

19:33.118 --> 19:36.354
- Moira: He wanted to sign, John.
- Johnny: Here we go.

19:36.389 --> 19:37.255
- He wants the town.
- That's it, that's it. Just on the line.

19:37.290 --> 19:39.558
Jocelyn: What is happening here?!

19:39.592 --> 19:42.394
Johnny: (Feigning surprise) What?
What happened? Oh no! Andy! What-

19:42.428 --> 19:44.796
Moira: Circulation, Johnny!
Circulation in his hand...

19:44.830 --> 19:46.830
Johnny: Circulation? He can't
even hold a pen, the poor guy.

19:46.864 --> 19:48.199
- Moira: There. He needs...
- Johnny: Circulation.

19:48.233 --> 19:49.533
Moira: Over the line, over the line.

19:49.568 --> 19:51.402
Jocelyn: I'm gonna call an ambulance.

19:51.436 --> 19:54.305
Johnny: What? No! Wait!
No, no, no, no! No, not yet!

19:54.339 --> 19:55.372
- Look, he's looking better already.
- (Shrieks) Wake up, Andy!

19:59.427 --> 20:01.216
People do come out of comas

20:01.241 --> 20:04.129
Moira: Oh, I'd kill for
a good coma right now.

20:04.154 --> 20:05.409
(Approaching footsteps)

20:05.420 --> 20:07.537
- Alexis: Hey.
- Moira: Where were you?

20:07.561 --> 20:10.154
Alexis: I was out. So
I'm gonna go keep packing.

20:10.179 --> 20:11.661
Moira: Wait.

20:11.686 --> 20:15.179
John? I don't have the heart.

20:15.204 --> 20:17.241
The deal fell through, honey.

20:17.266 --> 20:18.507
So when are we leaving?

20:18.532 --> 20:23.090
Moira: We're not leaving, Alexis.
We didn't sell.

20:23.115 --> 20:26.548
Alexis: We're not leaving?

20:26.582 --> 20:29.296
(Gasps) (Sinking in) Oh...

20:29.321 --> 20:32.187
Moira: Are you going to be all right?

20:33.910 --> 20:37.614
I'm pretty sure I'm engaged,

20:37.639 --> 20:42.598
and I'm pretty sure I
just cheated on my fiance.

20:42.623 --> 20:45.390
Johnny: She'll be okay.
Where's your brother?

20:45.602 --> 20:46.768
(Still stunned) Who?

20:46.793 --> 20:47.859
Johnny: David!
