01:10.028 --> 01:11.987
A long time ago...

01:12.238 --> 01:15.491
a young woman went off
into the world...

01:16.284 --> 01:18.786
like her brothers and sisters.

01:18.995 --> 01:20.788
She fought in wars...

01:20.997 --> 01:22.623
had children...

01:22.874 --> 01:23.874
suffered...

01:24.084 --> 01:26.418
and loved greatly.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.221
I was the sixth-born child...

01:37.472 --> 01:39.223
Phung Thi Le Ly...

01:41.643 --> 01:46.146
and I lived in the most
beautiful village on earth.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.863
My earliest memories were
working alongside Mother in the fields.

03:18.072 --> 03:19.823
Always working, my mother.

03:20.491 --> 03:24.536
Each grain of rice,
a symbol of life never wasted.

03:25.079 --> 03:29.583
While we worked, she would teach me
everything I had to know about life.

03:30.168 --> 03:34.046
Mama, where did I really come from?
Where do babies come from?

03:36.424 --> 03:39.259
From my bellybutton.

03:41.054 --> 03:45.224
Don't worry. God makes babies
and put them in your belly.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.226
You have plenty of warning.

03:50.271 --> 03:54.858
The fragile rice had to be
planted and transplanted several times.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.655
Our rice paddies were always
near the cemeteries...

03:59.906 --> 04:03.992
because we believed the spirits
passed through the soil into the rice...

04:04.202 --> 04:06.703
so the new generation,
in eating the rice...

04:06.913 --> 04:09.706
was sharing in the spirit
of their ancestors.

05:03.886 --> 05:08.056
Then one day,
in the summer of 1953...

05:08.308 --> 05:09.308
the French came.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.997
They destroyed our village.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.791
And the following year,
we went hungry.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.503
I will never forget
my father's eyes...

05:38.755 --> 05:42.299
as he watched our house
burn to the ground.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.887
But as it had happened to our village
for so many centuries...

05:47.096 --> 05:49.514
we rebuilt our lives.

06:42.485 --> 06:45.529
Mama, where do babies
really come from?

08:00.563 --> 08:02.856
Then in 1963...

08:03.483 --> 08:07.235
the peasant countryside
changed forever.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.215
When the Vietcong first
arrived that rainy season...

08:28.424 --> 08:32.177
some of them were remnants
from the war against the French.

08:32.385 --> 08:35.514
Many of them were displaced
immigrants from the North.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.099
All of them were angry.

08:54.992 --> 08:58.036
My parents taught me Vietnam is...

08:59.997 --> 09:01.831
a free nation.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.251
That is what this war is about.

09:04.460 --> 09:08.296
The Chinese, the Japanese, the French.
They have each tried to rule us.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.507
And we have won!

09:10.716 --> 09:13.927
The North and the South are
inseparable, like sisters.

09:14.178 --> 09:18.848
But in 1954 the French and American
allies gave themselves the right...

09:19.058 --> 09:21.810
to separate us
and kidnap the South.

09:22.853 --> 09:24.980
Can we stand by
and watch the kidnappers...

09:25.189 --> 09:28.942
taking turns raping
and corrupting our sister?

09:29.610 --> 09:32.237
That is what this war is about.

09:34.490 --> 09:35.991
Why should outsiders come in...

09:36.242 --> 09:40.412
divide the land and tell some people
to go north and then go south?

09:40.663 --> 09:43.331
If Vietnam were truly
for the Vietnamese people...

09:43.583 --> 09:47.002
shouldn't we be able to choose
the kind of government we want?

09:47.211 --> 09:51.047
A nation cannot have 2 governments any
more than a family can have 2 fathers.

09:51.465 --> 09:55.010
- They have bombs, 10 to one!
- He's right.

09:55.386 --> 09:56.886
What do we have?

09:57.888 --> 10:00.015
We have rags, we have rifles!

10:00.766 --> 10:03.059
And sticks! We have sticks!

10:04.228 --> 10:06.938
We have no rank, no promotion.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.108
We take no money.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.528
We are your servants.

10:14.405 --> 10:17.282
We respect your homes and shrines.

10:18.826 --> 10:20.493
We are your family.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.396
Do you want to dance?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.065
Le Ly, come on.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.956
It was my brother Sau
I loved the most.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.543
He was always there to protect me
and make me laugh.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.269
Hurry.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.523
Sweet rice, black beans.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.192
You be very careful. Write, Sau.

11:34.402 --> 11:35.694
I will return.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.368
- Take care.
- Le Ly, I will return.

11:43.577 --> 11:47.163
Be a big girl.
Always take care of Mama and Papa.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.499
Protect yourself from ghosts.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.042
Take care.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.340
As they went north to Hanoi
with the Vietcong...

11:57.758 --> 12:01.594
I felt it was the last time
I'd see my older brother, Bon...

12:01.804 --> 12:05.140
and my younger brother, Sau,
for a long, long time.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.100
Maybe forever.

12:08.310 --> 12:11.020
But it was Sau who was ripped
from my heart.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.240
You understand that a country
is more than dirt...

12:22.450 --> 12:24.451
rivers and forests?

12:28.205 --> 12:31.291
You know your brother Sau
may not come back?

12:38.632 --> 12:40.717
I told you many times...

12:41.010 --> 12:43.386
the Chinese ruled our land.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.806
Many die.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.435
Le Loi, Jia Long
and the Trung sisters.

12:50.728 --> 12:54.481
And your ancestor Phung Thi Chinh
fought to throw out the Chinese.

12:55.649 --> 12:58.943
Your grandfather fought
and died against the Japanese...

12:59.195 --> 13:01.112
just before you were born.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.656
We suffered much.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.869
When the Japanese came...

13:08.162 --> 13:10.914
your mother and I
were taken to Danang...

13:11.123 --> 13:13.249
to build a runway
for the airplanes.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.254
We worked like slaves.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.800
Our reward was a bowl of rice...

13:22.968 --> 13:25.136
and another day of life.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.306
Freedom is never a gift, be Ly.

13:29.016 --> 13:32.477
It must be won and won again.
You know that?

13:32.686 --> 13:33.686
I do.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.396
See this land?

13:36.106 --> 13:39.359
Vietnam is going to be yours now.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.070
If the enemy comes back...

13:42.363 --> 13:45.824
you must be both a daughter
and a son now.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.966
From my father I learned to
love God and people I could not see...

14:03.217 --> 14:04.968
my ancestors.

14:06.303 --> 14:07.762
But I would learn in time...

14:08.013 --> 14:11.891
my father's words
would be twisted by events.

15:29.929 --> 15:34.223
Government soldiers came with
the support of American advisors.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.975
Your village will be safe.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.853
They built barricades
against the Vietcong.

15:39.146 --> 15:41.314
It's part of the new Binh Ky hamlet.

15:42.066 --> 15:46.402
Many of you will be asked
to take militia training...

15:46.654 --> 15:48.696
so you will be prepared...

15:48.906 --> 15:52.075
to resist the Communist rebel!

15:52.493 --> 15:54.077
You will be rewarded...

15:54.286 --> 15:56.329
with food and money.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.749
Your older children
will be sent to camp...

16:00.000 --> 16:01.751
for military training.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.712
But younger children can go to school.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.759
Your village will be
happy and peaceful.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.679
Do you have any questions?

16:13.847 --> 16:15.431
Go to your leader.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.022
The soldiers ate our food,
slept with our women...

16:23.232 --> 16:24.774
and searched our homes...

16:24.984 --> 16:28.695
just as the soldiers of
the warlords had centuries before.

16:29.196 --> 16:33.533
But the government's leader, whose name
was Ngo Dinh Diem, America's ally...

16:33.867 --> 16:35.576
was a Catholic,
like the French...

16:35.786 --> 16:39.747
and that alone made him suspicious
to the Buddhists in our area.

16:41.917 --> 16:44.293
The Northern leader, Ho Chi Minh...

16:44.503 --> 16:47.755
had been a great patriot
against the Japanese and the French.

16:47.965 --> 16:52.719
And we always heard stories of his
compassion and his love for Vietnam.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.357
- You VC?
- No VC!

17:08.944 --> 17:10.319
What are they?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.738
Americans?

17:13.781 --> 17:17.035
They say they all have blind blue eyes
behind their glasses.

17:17.243 --> 17:21.289
If you take their shoes off,
they have soft feet and cry in pain.

17:21.498 --> 17:25.585
Take away their glasses,
their boots, they can't fight.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.795
Not very good soldiers.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.006
Not very good fence.

17:30.758 --> 17:33.593
Your president, Ngo Dinh Diem,
wants to know...

17:33.844 --> 17:37.055
what will you do
if you see a Vietcong...

17:37.264 --> 17:40.391
or hear about someone
who's helping them?

17:40.601 --> 17:44.937
Turn him in to the soldiers.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.731
Good.

17:46.774 --> 17:51.486
And get a big reward for
every Vietcong you help capture.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.281
During the day,
we were a government village.

17:55.616 --> 17:56.657
But each night...

17:56.867 --> 18:00.536
when the soldiers returned
to their base and we played...

18:00.954 --> 18:04.248
there was never any shortage
of Vietcong fighters.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.262
One night, the Vietcong
came for my teacher.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.820
Teaching these children
to betray their country!

18:40.911 --> 18:43.496
The first thing you should
learn on this night...

18:43.705 --> 18:46.290
Ky La was saved
from the boots of the oppressors.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.084
We're the liberators!

18:48.836 --> 18:50.545
The night belonged to the Vietcong.

18:51.421 --> 18:54.882
Even though I was scared,
there was no real choice.

18:55.551 --> 18:59.262
They fought for our freedom
against the Southern government.

18:59.888 --> 19:03.057
No matter who's asking
the questions, either side...

19:03.308 --> 19:06.227
play stupid, stupid, stupid child.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.191
- Any news from Sau or Bon?
- They're training in the North.

19:12.401 --> 19:16.362
- Any chance for a visit?
- There's no time for sons and mothers.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.577
I told them we needed her on the farm.

19:22.786 --> 19:24.537
For all the help she is here...

19:24.788 --> 19:27.039
maybe we should send her with Sau.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.375
That'll teach her the value of work.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.585
Don't say that!

19:30.794 --> 19:33.754
Le Ly must do her work
like everyone else.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.923
She thinks she's too good for work.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.467
Too busy flirting
with no-good schoolboys.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.180
- No, the big boys bother me...
- Don't talk like that.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.723
- Be quiet!
- Don't hit her.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.600
Do you hear me?

19:45.809 --> 19:48.436
Do you want to send all my children
to Hanoi or Saigon?

19:48.896 --> 19:52.273
If I can't have my family around me,
what's the point of living?

19:52.524 --> 19:54.692
You always think only of yourself!

19:54.902 --> 19:58.029
The French, the Japanese,
now the Americans are all over us!

19:58.238 --> 20:00.406
It's good they go north and fight.

20:00.657 --> 20:03.326
War is coming,
you stupid, selfish man!

20:03.577 --> 20:04.744
Stop it!

20:04.995 --> 20:06.078
Go!

20:12.711 --> 20:14.378
Forgive him, Mama.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.631
Don't cry.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.844
I've made your papa lose face.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.098
If you ever do that to a husband...

20:26.308 --> 20:30.186
I'll have both your cheeks glowing,
one from him and one from me.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.646
You hear me?

20:50.082 --> 20:52.083
Which one is first?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.627
Anybody? This is it!

20:54.878 --> 20:57.463
You talk now or it's bye-bye, Charlie!

20:59.216 --> 21:00.549
You dig, asshole?

21:10.227 --> 21:12.061
All right, it's your ass!

21:12.479 --> 21:14.146
Kiss it goodbye.

21:19.236 --> 21:20.611
You're next.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.488
You talk?

21:26.076 --> 21:28.077
You gonna talk?

21:29.788 --> 21:32.957
- Ah!
- Shhh.

21:59.443 --> 22:04.238
At my mother's request, a local
wizard examined the umbilical cords...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.240
of my two soldier brothers...

22:06.450 --> 22:08.451
who had not written
in over a year.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.161
The older one...

22:10.662 --> 22:12.621
is strong and healthy.

22:14.458 --> 22:15.958
The younger one...

22:16.209 --> 22:19.545
is in a place
too gray for me to see.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.049
No, this is not true.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.051
I know Sau is alive.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.761
I feel it in my womb.

22:33.393 --> 22:34.435
Did you hear...

22:34.644 --> 22:36.771
funny noises last night?

22:37.397 --> 22:40.608
Maybe voices last night in the rain?

22:41.443 --> 22:42.526
I did.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.155
Here is your trouble then.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.240
Your shrine...

22:48.658 --> 22:50.409
is too small.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.871
And we have a lost soul...

22:54.081 --> 22:55.581
who needs to come in.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.041
That's all.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.378
Just build a shrine outside...

23:00.629 --> 23:03.047
and everything will be fine.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.710
The Vietcong ingrained in us
a sense of xa...

23:42.295 --> 23:43.462
duty to land...

23:43.755 --> 23:45.381
duty to country.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.300
The ant became our moral model.

23:49.136 --> 23:53.514
We formed cells, associations where
no one accumulated power over others.

23:53.723 --> 23:58.102
Only in battle or by your
own hands will you be immortalized.

23:58.812 --> 24:03.566
You never moved up in the ant
society, you only moved further in.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.776
If the Vietcong won us over...

24:06.486 --> 24:09.238
it was because they lived
their lives with us.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.281
But every time we ambushed
the government soldiers...

25:34.741 --> 25:37.368
twice as many came back.

26:34.050 --> 26:37.636
Get your asses in there.
Get your smart asses down there!

26:47.606 --> 26:48.647
One day...

26:48.857 --> 26:50.482
they came for me.

26:53.069 --> 26:55.154
Papa! Help me!

27:23.767 --> 27:26.727
Tell me quickly.
Why were you on the road?

27:26.936 --> 27:29.813
Cutting grass for the water buffalo.
I didn't tell my parents.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.065
Liar.

27:35.278 --> 27:36.278
Again.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.491
Why were you on the road?

27:40.700 --> 27:42.951
I didn't mean any harm to anybody.

27:43.328 --> 27:44.620
Liar!

27:57.509 --> 27:59.176
You are can bo cai...

27:59.636 --> 28:01.637
VC cadre girl.

28:01.971 --> 28:04.390
You were giving warning
to your friends.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.772
Where's the VC base?

28:13.400 --> 28:14.900
I don't know.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.917
How many battles have you been in?

28:32.627 --> 28:34.002
What is your rank?

28:35.505 --> 28:36.505
Please...

28:39.926 --> 28:41.176
I'm just a girl.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.845
I haven't done anything.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.151
Do you know what this is for?

28:57.527 --> 29:00.279
Think about what
this can do to your body.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.824
How would your baby like you
with no nipples?

29:04.033 --> 29:07.995
Or maybe I could cut some skin off
your ass to make some sandals.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.955
Think about it...

29:10.623 --> 29:12.207
Miss Vietcong Hero.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.710
And when you're called again...

29:14.919 --> 29:18.213
you be prepared to tell me
everything you know.

30:28.493 --> 30:29.952
Don't move.

30:30.537 --> 30:31.578
Don't move.

31:06.322 --> 31:09.575
I haven't done anything!
I don't know anything!

32:28.363 --> 32:31.573
My mother used my dowry
to bribe a military official...

32:31.824 --> 32:33.575
to have me released.

32:33.785 --> 32:34.785
And now...

32:34.827 --> 32:39.706
the villagers were suspicious
of my family's ties to the government.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.547
Finally...

32:47.757 --> 32:50.050
the Vietcong came for me.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.138
- She did nothing!
- Stay back!

32:55.348 --> 32:56.348
No respect!

32:56.724 --> 32:57.849
You've no respect!

32:58.101 --> 33:00.936
- I'm coming too!
- No, the prisoner come alone!

33:01.980 --> 33:03.021
Stay back!

33:04.023 --> 33:05.774
Our men were betrayed.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.276
There are informers here!

33:08.611 --> 33:11.071
How else could the enemy know so much?

33:12.365 --> 33:15.617
This village is filled
with traitors...

33:16.536 --> 33:20.122
government sympathizers that
would sell us out for a relative...

33:20.415 --> 33:22.791
for money, for privilege!

33:23.459 --> 33:25.043
So I ask you:

33:25.586 --> 33:28.130
What should we do with these people?

33:28.339 --> 33:31.591
We must give these people a lesson
they will never forget.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.015
See?

33:38.891 --> 33:39.933
See it?

33:44.147 --> 33:46.064
- What is it?
- A grave.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.441
Your grave...

33:47.525 --> 33:48.734
stupid girl.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.447
What kind of deal
did you make to get out?

33:53.656 --> 33:56.825
Did you promise them
some of our ears for their belts?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.954
My mother bribed an official.
Why won't you believe me?

34:01.164 --> 34:02.414
Little rich girl!

34:29.942 --> 34:31.443
You want to live?

34:35.489 --> 34:37.324
My life is in your hands.

34:37.574 --> 34:39.159
What does that mean?

34:40.203 --> 34:42.454
I mean, I won't talk to the enemy.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.041
I've been shamed enough in my village.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.918
If you want, I'll go far away.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.004
I'll never come back.

34:56.135 --> 34:59.346
You talk about this,
we'll kill you for real.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.724
Oh, no! Oh, no!

35:03.726 --> 35:04.976
No, don't!

35:05.228 --> 35:07.062
No, get off!

35:11.651 --> 35:12.651
Shut up!

35:40.930 --> 35:43.765
I was never to understand
why I was raped...

35:43.975 --> 35:45.308
and not killed.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.272
Or if I had ever really
been sentenced by the Vietcong.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.111
It may have just been
a warning to my father.

35:58.030 --> 35:59.906
But it ended forever...

36:00.324 --> 36:02.617
my relationship to my village.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.478
My sister Hai found us
a job in the city.

36:30.730 --> 36:34.941
Papa stayed on the land to guard
the spirits of our ancestors.

36:36.319 --> 36:37.319
In Saigon...

36:37.862 --> 36:39.529
much to our confusion...

36:39.739 --> 36:41.948
the monks were being arrested.

36:52.877 --> 36:56.796
I've never seen so many cars,
so many people.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.758
The other one.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.612
Madame, they're ready.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.496
This way.

37:45.388 --> 37:47.973
Country fresh. Good workers.

37:52.061 --> 37:53.561
So which village?

37:53.813 --> 37:54.896
Ky La.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.065
Near Danang.

37:59.151 --> 38:01.319
Le is wonderful with children.

38:01.570 --> 38:03.238
Perfect babysitter.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.407
How old is she?

38:05.658 --> 38:06.741
Eighteen.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.619
Is she strong?

38:09.829 --> 38:14.457
Yes, she's very strong. She started
to work in the fields since she was 4.

38:17.586 --> 38:18.586
They'll do.

38:18.629 --> 38:20.422
Yes, ma'am. Let's go.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.134
Le Ly! Le Ly!

39:06.385 --> 39:09.012
You'll be punished for this,
you stupid girl!

39:09.221 --> 39:11.264
Making the master open the door!

39:11.474 --> 39:15.101
Don't be too hard on her.
It's been a long day for everyone.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.687
Run off to bed. I'm fine. Go on.

41:07.840 --> 41:09.340
I could not sleep.

41:09.842 --> 41:12.051
I couldn't either, master.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.635
I am not your first.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.596
Yes, you are.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.565
I was raped...

42:52.736 --> 42:55.238
by the village boys in Ky La.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.368
My poor thing.

43:35.487 --> 43:36.738
Have you bled?

43:44.288 --> 43:46.331
Stupid girl.

43:46.624 --> 43:50.293
You were not satisfied with
a perfect life in a perfect house?

43:50.502 --> 43:55.048
You had to seduce the husband!
Make him stray from his wife.

43:55.257 --> 43:56.716
Look what it brought you.

43:56.925 --> 44:00.386
That's not how it happened!
Anh cares for me, he loves me.

44:00.679 --> 44:05.016
Do you think a stupid girl like you
means anything to him?

44:05.225 --> 44:07.810
Now you're going to have his bastard.

44:08.187 --> 44:09.437
Perfect!

44:09.730 --> 44:11.773
You will just have to get rid of it.

44:12.816 --> 44:15.401
We'll go see the herbalist tomorrow.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.233
What are you doing, Le Ly?

44:55.984 --> 44:58.111
Oh, I'm sorry, madame.

45:02.282 --> 45:04.367
I'm expecting a child.

45:05.661 --> 45:07.078
Yes, I know.

45:07.496 --> 45:10.039
We learned it from the herbalist.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.875
Who is the father?

45:14.002 --> 45:16.212
Don't look so surprised.

45:19.758 --> 45:21.092
A boy.

45:22.010 --> 45:25.263
Someone I met in the park.
You don't know him.

45:26.014 --> 45:28.266
Why are you burning incense?

45:30.018 --> 45:31.436
Because...

45:32.020 --> 45:33.688
I don't want the baby.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.815
I was praying to be forgiven.

45:36.316 --> 45:39.360
In front of my husband's ancestors?

45:41.238 --> 45:43.322
I don't know what else to do.

45:43.532 --> 45:45.116
The boy's Catholic, like you.

45:46.034 --> 45:47.535
I'm a Buddhist.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.620
I see.

45:52.374 --> 45:54.333
Well, I have another explanation.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.339
I believe the father
of your baby is my husband.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.092
Oh, no! Anh, I mean the mas...

46:03.343 --> 46:04.927
Be silent!

46:13.020 --> 46:15.146
You know I'm not well.

46:16.064 --> 46:18.775
But I have given my husband sons.

46:19.276 --> 46:21.068
Beautiful boys.

46:21.528 --> 46:24.155
As fine as any woman
could have given him.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.364
So don't think...

46:26.909 --> 46:29.619
you won't pay for what you've done.

46:31.121 --> 46:34.165
You and your daughter must
leave the house at once.

46:34.374 --> 46:35.416
Leave?

46:36.418 --> 46:37.502
But why?

46:38.587 --> 46:40.588
Nobody knows but you.

46:41.381 --> 46:44.258
Let people think
the father is some soldier.

46:44.510 --> 46:46.844
I know, and that's enough.

46:49.264 --> 46:52.308
Men are like dogs pissing on posts.

46:52.518 --> 46:54.060
They go once, they go twice.

46:54.603 --> 46:58.439
But be Ly's no threat to you.
She has nothing for a proper man.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.525
She's just a country girl.

47:01.109 --> 47:04.153
An ignorant, stupid, foolish child.

47:04.446 --> 47:06.572
A maid that will never be a bride.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.825
She's nothing! Worthless!

47:09.034 --> 47:10.701
Absolutely not.

47:11.119 --> 47:13.120
I won't have her in my house.

47:13.455 --> 47:14.455
Not as a nanny.

47:15.374 --> 47:16.582
Not as a housekeeper.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.376
Then as number two wife!

47:19.127 --> 47:20.461
You're out of your mind.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.923
As concubine to the master.

47:24.132 --> 47:26.342
As your slave to kick around.

47:26.760 --> 47:29.971
To warm your husband's bed
when you have better things to do.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.682
Why waste your health
on a man's rutting...

47:32.891 --> 47:34.767
when a stupid girl can do it?

47:36.019 --> 47:39.397
You're always number one wife.
The law is on your side.

47:39.690 --> 47:42.233
- Please, Mama!
- Stupid, stop!

47:49.950 --> 47:52.785
They must go now.
Today, before supper.

47:53.078 --> 47:55.246
You tried to get rid of it?

47:55.664 --> 47:59.458
Yes, of course. But your seed,
master, is too strong.

47:59.668 --> 48:02.336
Now it has hold of be Ly too.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.673
Please, help us get by
the best we can.

48:05.924 --> 48:08.175
At least until the child is born.

48:09.177 --> 48:11.387
I won't throw you into the street.

48:11.763 --> 48:15.141
But I cannot ask my wife
to let you live with us.

48:16.143 --> 48:18.519
- I'll put you in an apartment.
- Not in Saigon.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.521
How far away do you want them?

48:21.440 --> 48:23.608
How far can you drive in a day?

48:26.445 --> 48:27.570
All right.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.408
They'll go to Danang...

48:32.618 --> 48:33.868
But we have nothing!

48:34.077 --> 48:36.245
With enough money
until the baby's born.

48:36.455 --> 48:38.122
I'll send you money monthly.

48:38.332 --> 48:39.832
To a bank or a relative.

48:40.459 --> 48:42.543
I don't want you
to know their address.

48:43.712 --> 48:45.796
That's an absolute condition.

48:48.050 --> 48:50.801
You will have enough to live on.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.513
My steward will handle everything.

48:55.474 --> 48:57.224
One day she'll come back!

48:57.559 --> 49:01.020
Don't forget her! She makes
an excellent second wife.

49:02.105 --> 49:03.856
Promise you won't forget her.

49:11.239 --> 49:12.615
But the money never came.

49:12.991 --> 49:15.076
Madame Lien saw to that.

49:15.869 --> 49:18.788
My mother sold snails
for a while in Danang...

49:18.997 --> 49:21.832
but soon gave up
and returned to Ky La.

49:22.334 --> 49:26.879
My father, ashamed that I was unmarried
and pregnant, refused to see me.

49:27.130 --> 49:29.006
- You want Mary Jane?
- Go away.

49:29.257 --> 49:31.092
Hey, G.I., number one cigarette?

49:31.343 --> 49:32.969
How about some boom-boom?

49:33.178 --> 49:35.179
No, me no hooker!

49:35.389 --> 49:37.264
- Give you $10.
- No. Cigarette?

49:37.474 --> 49:39.392
- $15.
- No. Cigarette?

49:39.601 --> 49:42.979
What you hiding there?
Those baby bellies turn me on.

49:43.188 --> 49:48.275
- Come on, give you $50. Come on.
- No can do! No, you fuck off!

50:06.962 --> 50:08.879
What's in the box?

50:09.339 --> 50:11.424
Johnny Walker, cigarette.

50:12.175 --> 50:14.051
- What's this?
- Marijuana, huh?

50:15.637 --> 50:17.471
This is all I have.

50:20.142 --> 50:21.559
That's okay.

50:54.968 --> 50:55.968
Where's Kim?

50:56.845 --> 50:58.429
Kim work.

50:58.722 --> 51:00.723
Kim work.

51:05.979 --> 51:07.855
I'll wait for her, little sister.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.982
No, baby san. Baby san.

51:11.651 --> 51:13.569
- You go bye.
- Beer.

51:13.779 --> 51:15.362
You go bye.

51:19.743 --> 51:20.785
Beer?

51:33.965 --> 51:35.341
Yeah?

51:38.095 --> 51:39.512
I look for Kim.

51:40.639 --> 51:42.014
Me daughter.

51:43.558 --> 51:45.768
- Kim here?
- She no here.

51:45.977 --> 51:48.104
Please. Me daughter, daughter.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.231
I come long way.

51:50.607 --> 51:52.316
- Go away.
- Please, please.

51:52.526 --> 51:55.194
Me Papa. Papa.

51:55.821 --> 51:57.446
No see long time.

51:58.323 --> 51:59.532
Please, please!

52:01.076 --> 52:03.786
Go now, you fucking
stupid gook asshole!

52:24.599 --> 52:27.935
- What are you doing here?
- Papa's at the house. Paul's back.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.895
Paul's back? So soon?

52:31.106 --> 52:34.859
Paul, good to see you, honey!
This isn't a good time.

52:35.193 --> 52:36.735
Oh, baby!

52:36.945 --> 52:41.866
I'm six weeks in the fucking bush.
I need some pussy bad! Now!

52:42.117 --> 52:45.035
Father came a long way to see me.
Not good time.

52:45.495 --> 52:47.454
He's got time, I don't. Get him out!

52:49.541 --> 52:50.541
Come back.

52:50.709 --> 52:53.836
I need some pussy, baby. Now!

52:54.045 --> 52:55.880
He pays my bills. He's my man.

52:56.131 --> 52:58.716
- Will you come on?
- Give me a little time, Papa.

52:58.967 --> 53:01.051
Come back in two hours.

53:03.471 --> 53:04.471
Let's do it.

53:07.475 --> 53:10.019
Ouch! Jesus Christ, baby.

53:29.039 --> 53:30.039
See you.

53:40.550 --> 53:42.801
I came to see your sister.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.136
She's at work.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.472
Selling near the base.

53:46.681 --> 53:49.683
- Is she doing well? Getting by?
- She's lazy.

53:50.018 --> 53:52.645
- But I help her all I can.
- And the baby?

53:52.854 --> 53:55.731
I don't know why she
seduced her master's husband.

53:55.982 --> 53:59.276
When she got caught,
did she keep quiet? No.

53:59.819 --> 54:01.695
She has brought shame on us.

54:01.947 --> 54:03.864
An unwed mother.

54:05.116 --> 54:08.869
But she's not the only one
who has brought shame to us.

54:11.957 --> 54:14.041
I do the best I can, Papa.

54:14.668 --> 54:16.460
I'll be late for work.

54:18.797 --> 54:20.089
When you see be Ly...

54:22.801 --> 54:25.094
tell her I came here to see her.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.432
I miss her very much.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.938
She should not worry about
being punished for her mistake.

54:37.857 --> 54:40.693
Life finds a way to balance itself.

54:45.323 --> 54:47.199
Will you tell her that for me?

54:48.326 --> 54:49.910
Of course, Papa.

54:51.454 --> 54:52.579
And me?

54:54.207 --> 54:56.208
You too, my sweet one.

55:05.260 --> 55:07.678
Your boyfriend treated Papa so bad.

55:08.221 --> 55:09.888
You would be ashamed.

55:10.098 --> 55:11.265
You were there.

55:12.100 --> 55:14.768
This is not the way
Papa taught us to be.

55:16.896 --> 55:19.773
Do you think I like what I'm doing?

55:20.108 --> 55:22.943
Somebody has to make
a living here. You don't help!

55:23.153 --> 55:25.237
I don't know why I let you stay here!

55:25.447 --> 55:26.947
My boyfriends complain about you!

55:27.657 --> 55:29.116
Pregnant women are bad luck!

55:29.617 --> 55:32.202
How disrespectful you are!
If Papa...

55:32.412 --> 55:33.537
Papa what?

55:34.164 --> 55:35.581
- An invader!
- Really?

55:36.124 --> 55:39.251
You sleep with the enemy!
You betray your family!

55:40.754 --> 55:42.087
That's enough!

55:42.297 --> 55:43.589
That's enough out of you!

55:45.133 --> 55:47.676
And I'll marry one too! You'll see!

55:48.470 --> 55:52.222
And I'll get out
of this goddamn country!

55:53.391 --> 55:55.642
And as for you, young lady...

55:55.894 --> 55:58.729
no more charity for you!

55:58.980 --> 56:00.189
Go on! Get out!

56:00.774 --> 56:05.444
Get out! Do you think that
you're the only one Papa loves?

56:05.695 --> 56:07.696
You spoiled!

56:09.783 --> 56:11.033
Spoiled!

56:22.170 --> 56:26.882
To survive, I picked through
the American base camp garbage.

56:37.102 --> 56:40.104
And it was there that
I first saw the remains...

56:40.313 --> 56:43.440
of poor prostitutes
who had been murdered by men.

56:53.618 --> 56:55.577
Thank heaven it's a boy.

56:55.787 --> 56:58.705
Put him up to feed quickly.
Too much blood.

57:01.835 --> 57:03.001
How will you care for him?

57:03.628 --> 57:06.130
Better give him away or kill him.

57:06.339 --> 57:09.049
And your shame will be washed away.

57:20.353 --> 57:24.606
You're lucky, among the indig
personnel referred to this office.

57:25.150 --> 57:28.610
I will have no problem placing you.

57:29.529 --> 57:32.239
Provided, of course, you play ball.

57:33.491 --> 57:34.491
No big deal.

57:35.326 --> 57:37.619
We'll do it any way you want.

57:37.871 --> 57:39.663
Now, you do your best...

57:40.748 --> 57:42.583
and I'll do my best.

57:47.797 --> 57:48.797
Open door!

57:50.383 --> 57:54.052
Don't make such a big deal about it.
Just a little suck...

57:58.683 --> 57:59.683
Bitch!

58:01.644 --> 58:02.769
Stop!

58:03.104 --> 58:05.314
You! Call MP now!

58:05.565 --> 58:07.191
This man try rape me!

58:07.442 --> 58:08.859
Go! Go!

58:10.487 --> 58:13.447
Supposed to be a joke, right?
It's a joke.

58:15.783 --> 58:17.117
Months went by.

58:18.036 --> 58:22.915
There were more prostitutes, black
marketeers. Everything had a price.

58:24.501 --> 58:26.001
My family was suffering.

58:26.211 --> 58:30.964
My papa had gotten old and sick
and could no longer work the land.

58:32.300 --> 58:35.093
Hey, G.I., you buy? You buy?

58:35.303 --> 58:38.931
- Not today.
- G.I., you buy? Smokes? You buy?

58:40.183 --> 58:41.517
G.I., you buy?

58:42.143 --> 58:43.185
Hey, Le.

58:43.436 --> 58:44.436
Hi, Big Mike.

58:44.479 --> 58:46.438
You look beaucoup sau.

58:46.648 --> 58:48.023
No good day.

58:48.566 --> 58:51.401
I got something to change
your mood. See those grunts?

58:52.070 --> 58:54.655
They're leaving for the world today.

58:55.031 --> 58:56.657
So what? They want souvenirs?

58:56.908 --> 58:59.993
I got Chinese jade, Big Mike.
Mary Jane. Titi money.

59:00.245 --> 59:03.914
No, they want a real souvenir.
They want boom-boom you.

59:04.749 --> 59:06.875
Beaucoup boom-boom over there.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.710
Plenty crabs too.

59:08.920 --> 59:13.340
These pencil-dicks are clean. They've
been in the bush since they got here.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.634
One of them's going home to his wife.

59:15.885 --> 59:19.596
Want them to go boom-boom some
scuzzbag and bring home the clap?

59:19.847 --> 59:22.558
They're willing to pay $20 each head.

59:23.560 --> 59:26.353
Le Ly good girl. Fuck off.

59:26.729 --> 59:30.232
Okay, 5 flags and that's just for one.
$100 for the other.

59:30.441 --> 59:33.151
Two hundred dollars, real money.

59:33.570 --> 59:34.570
Why?

59:35.280 --> 59:36.446
Too much.

59:36.906 --> 59:37.948
You joking.

59:38.199 --> 59:41.034
These guys got the bread
from being in the bush.

59:41.244 --> 59:43.787
I told them clean poon is expensive.

59:44.330 --> 59:45.872
Look, Le...

59:46.124 --> 59:49.793
They beat the odds.
They want to leave something behind.

59:50.044 --> 59:52.004
A memory. Something.

59:54.674 --> 59:56.883
Le Ly not that kind of girl.

59:57.552 --> 59:58.552
No deal.

59:58.636 --> 01:00:01.888
Jesus Christ,
you drive a hard bargain.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:05.225
400 fucking dollars. This is green.

01:00:05.643 --> 01:00:07.978
And that's it.
That's all they gave me.

01:00:08.187 --> 01:00:11.064
You give me 50 commission,
you pocket 350.

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:14.943
Support your family for a year, easy.
What's so hard about it?

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:19.197
15 minutes. It ain't even work.
Lie there and let them do the work.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:22.117
What'll they do that
ain't been done already?

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:27.289
They don't got all day.
Take the money...

01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.708
and give them
a story to bring home.

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.168
You're no cherry.

01:00:32.378 --> 01:00:34.463
Just do it for fucking world peace.

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.089
Come on!

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.426
Send the poor bastards home
with a smile.

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:05.554
My father was dying.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:10.183
I returned for the first time
to my village.

01:03:30.681 --> 01:03:32.057
What are you doing here?

01:03:32.725 --> 01:03:34.226
I heard there's trouble.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.977
Where's Papa?

01:03:37.396 --> 01:03:38.980
Your papa...

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:45.779
The Americans came one day
to look at our family bunker.

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:51.368
They think Vietcong inside,
make Papa go inside first.

01:03:51.577 --> 01:03:52.911
No VC!

01:03:53.371 --> 01:03:56.122
But he told them no one was inside.

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:58.041
They still throw grenade.

01:03:59.293 --> 01:04:00.961
But it did not explode.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.132
Then two Americans went in.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.802
No more.

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:13.014
They were very angry at your papa.

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:14.933
They beat him.

01:04:15.351 --> 01:04:16.935
Put paper on his back:

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:18.395
"VC."

01:04:19.063 --> 01:04:20.146
Took him to prison.

01:04:20.773 --> 01:04:23.066
Bad, bad beating.

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:28.864
Come, Mama. Come.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.052
Be Ly.

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:53.346
Papa.

01:04:56.350 --> 01:04:58.018
You're drinking now.

01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:02.397
Stupid wizard came by the other day.

01:05:05.943 --> 01:05:07.402
He said to me:

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:12.282
"I have nothing to tell you."
Just like that. I have no future.

01:05:13.117 --> 01:05:14.743
He didn't mean it.

01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:17.954
If I stay in the village, I die.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.416
You know wizards
hate to give people bad news.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:25.879
You're just imagining things.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.881
Who's worried?

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:32.677
What's wrong with living forever
with your ancestors?

01:05:33.554 --> 01:05:37.891
I'm worried about you.
But your mother is not the same.

01:05:38.142 --> 01:05:40.060
What happened to her?

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:45.315
The Vietcong came after Americans,
killed so many of them in a fight.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.067
They were angry.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.319
Traitor! Traitor!

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:59.663
Your Uncle Luc told him to stop.

01:05:59.872 --> 01:06:04.167
He yelled, "How can a woman who sends
two sons to die for the revolution...

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.544
think of betraying her country?

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.214
How can you accuse her?"

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:16.846
Tell her to keep her mouth shut.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:31.027
I never should have left Ky La.

01:06:31.487 --> 01:06:34.864
I should have stayed to fight
the Vietcong...

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.408
the government.

01:06:36.909 --> 01:06:39.077
What am I now, Papa?

01:06:39.286 --> 01:06:41.746
Not a warrior woman. Not a Phung.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:45.625
Just a tramp, begging in the streets.

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.753
So ashamed.

01:06:49.463 --> 01:06:51.047
Don't be ashamed.

01:06:51.465 --> 01:06:53.341
You did the best you could.

01:06:54.385 --> 01:06:56.052
Listen to me.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:59.848
You were born to be
a wonderful wife...

01:07:00.057 --> 01:07:01.516
and a mother.

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:04.185
Not a killer.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.025
No, be Ly.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.947
Don't ask what's right or wrong.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.409
These questions are very dangerous.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:22.704
Right is only the goodness
you carry in your heart.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.624
Love for your ancestors,
for your family.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:31.296
Wrong is all that comes
between you and that love.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.050
Go back to your son.

01:07:35.259 --> 01:07:39.304
Make him the best son you can.
That is the war you must fight.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:41.973
That is the victory you must win.

01:07:47.229 --> 01:07:50.065
Quick. Before they see you and talk.

01:07:57.198 --> 01:07:59.074
My little peach blossom...

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:02.577
what will you do without me?

01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:19.094
My father died soon after.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:22.596
He drank acid and died
on the ground he loved.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:27.185
My father taught me life is
simple and compassion follows.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.895
He taught me by forgiving me
for being unwed...

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:32.816
and taking to his heart
my little child.

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:44.327
I bought my father
the best funeral he could have...

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.996
and we mourned him for 100 days.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:08.225
A year passed.

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:12.647
I got work at the Korean
commissary, serving drinks for tips.

01:09:15.109 --> 01:09:20.196
The war got worse, and the Americans
became part of our landscape...

01:09:20.447 --> 01:09:21.823
part of us.

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.506
I want you to meet Steve.
He's sergeant.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.511
Look, he want to meet
nice Vietnamese girl.

01:10:09.038 --> 01:10:10.955
Give me the rest of the money.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:18.546
Hey!

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:25.845
Wait a minute!

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.638
Look back there!

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:09.931
Yeah, I know her.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:20.483
There she is. She's come back.
Money, money.

01:11:20.901 --> 01:11:24.237
Sorry, my friend no take
no for answer.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:29.117
She's scared you take back money.
You chase her.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:30.910
Not my fault.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.245
Sorry.

01:11:39.795 --> 01:11:40.837
Yes?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.047
You want something else?

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:50.346
I told you,
I no want to be your girlfriend.

01:11:50.556 --> 01:11:52.890
You want girl, you go see hooker.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.019
Don't bother me.

01:11:56.603 --> 01:11:59.939
I'm too old for hookers.
I just wanted to meet you.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.817
I don't care about the money.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:06.738
Your girlfriend introduced us,
and that's all I wanted.

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:09.699
Since I have gone
to all of this trouble...

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:12.869
you think it'd be all right
if I just came in...

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:16.164
talked to you for a few moments?
Just talk.

01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.374
Please. Just a moment.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.210
- Please.
- Okay.

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:22.420
One minute.

01:12:23.255 --> 01:12:25.006
I leave door open.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:27.675

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:31.179

Okay.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:08.007
Thank you for coming.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:11.511
- I hope you happy stay in Danang.
- I'll wait for you.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.098
I go long time. I work
at Korean casino. Serve booze.

01:13:17.101 --> 01:13:20.978
- Hostess.
- That's okay, I have no place to go.

01:13:21.188 --> 01:13:23.064
I gave my money to your friend...

01:13:23.273 --> 01:13:26.692
and I can't afford a taxi
out of here. To tell the truth...

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.821
I'm tired from our little race.

01:13:31.323 --> 01:13:33.491
Okay. You can stay.

01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.159
But not too long.

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:37.745
When you go, lock door, please.

01:13:37.996 --> 01:13:40.081
Maybe we can have dinner later?

01:13:40.290 --> 01:13:41.791
I have dinner. Not possible.

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:43.167
No problem.

01:13:43.377 --> 01:13:46.671
Nice meeting you.
Lock door when you go. Goodbye.

01:13:55.514 --> 01:13:57.056
Hi.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.893
I hope you don't mind if
I stretched out for a while.

01:14:01.145 --> 01:14:02.353
You're still here?

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:06.065
You said I could rest. And I did
want to take you to dinner...

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.609
to thank you for your hospitality.

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:12.655
You no understand.
I no want go dinner.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.949
Then we'll just go...

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.077
for a walk or a drink.
It doesn't matter to me.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.454
I want you didi.

01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:21.247

but I no want boyfriend.

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.418
You have a boyfriend?

01:14:27.588 --> 01:14:30.047
You dinky dau.

01:14:31.383 --> 01:14:32.884
No. No boyfriend.

01:14:35.721 --> 01:14:37.346
Me had boyfriend.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:39.474
But me no want new boyfriend.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:40.725
I'm sorry.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.019
It sounds like he hurt you.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:46.314
Yes.

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:48.149
Beg your pardon?

01:14:50.527 --> 01:14:52.695
You want me give you money for taxi?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.449
- I'm perfectly content right here.
- I know.

01:14:57.201 --> 01:15:00.244
I know you want stay here,
but this my house.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.331
You want woman, I call siclo.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:06.751
I'm not interested in prostitutes.
I'm interested in you.

01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:10.379
Is this your little brother?

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:13.424
Is this handsome little boy
your relative?

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:16.552
- My son.
- Oh, of course he is.

01:15:18.138 --> 01:15:22.391
He looks just like you.
A lot of spirit around the eyes.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.360
Steve.

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.111
That your name?

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.530
Yeah.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.075
I sorry I not very nice to you.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.743
You want some tea?

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:58.094
Fat girl is my sister.
And this is Mom's eight dogs.

01:15:58.345 --> 01:16:01.806
She has the eight ugliest dogs
in the United States.

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:14.110
I think I better leave you alone.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:28.958
Too much rain.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.797
No taxi.

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.761
You stay until no more rain.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.434
You sure?

01:17:33.023 --> 01:17:34.482
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:17:35.317 --> 01:17:37.360
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:39.528
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:57.356
Anyone home?

01:18:58.191 --> 01:18:59.442
Steve!

01:19:02.362 --> 01:19:03.362
What all this?

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:07.241
Just a few things
for you and your family.

01:19:07.868 --> 01:19:10.745
We're gonna have Christmas
all over again.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:13.622
No, Steve, please.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.499
You do not do this.

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:17.501
You cannot.

01:19:17.711 --> 01:19:19.920
Oh, yeah. Sure, I can.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:24.550
Le, I'm not very good with words.
Even if I could speak your language...

01:19:24.801 --> 01:19:28.679
I don't think
I could tell you how I feel.

01:19:30.807 --> 01:19:32.683
I just want peace and happiness.

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:36.854
I just want to be with you
and help you and your little boy.

01:19:37.314 --> 01:19:38.773
And your mom.

01:19:39.399 --> 01:19:44.111
- Anything wrong with that?
- I no want be your girlfriend, Steve.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.573
I no want boyfriend!

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:49.950
Me and men...

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:52.578
we have bad karma.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.705
You understand?

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.959
How much bad could have happened
to a little girl like you?

01:19:59.169 --> 01:20:01.045
You no ask. Goodbye.

01:20:01.254 --> 01:20:03.714
You nice man. You find better girl.

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.425
Now wait a minute. Hold on here.

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.969
I know all about karma.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:12.681
My karma has taken me all over
the world most of my life...

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.558
living out of a duffel bag.

01:20:16.019 --> 01:20:17.645
That's why I'm here.

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:23.108
It's time to settle down,
quit pretending I'll live forever.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.861
I'm going home...

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.738
to San Diego.

01:20:29.449 --> 01:20:30.825
I got a house...

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.576
family there.

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:34.995
I want you to be there with me.

01:20:35.288 --> 01:20:38.541
You'll be safe. You'll be free.

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:41.460
Your boy will have his freedom...

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.379
and an education.

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:50.094
My first wife taught me a real lesson
in my life. I'm serious.

01:20:51.054 --> 01:20:54.265
I need a good Oriental woman.

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:57.017
Like you.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.645
If you'll have me...

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.773
I want you...

01:21:02.983 --> 01:21:04.608
to be my wife.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:19.623
Three years passed.

01:21:20.667 --> 01:21:24.670
No, no, that's Tommy. And we're
going to change "Hung" to "Jimmy."

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.757
We moved to the Central
Highlands with Steve's new job.

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:32.928
Steve loved our new son, Tommy,
as if his life had started again.

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:36.765
When you come to California,
Mama san, to visit my mama san...

01:21:37.017 --> 01:21:39.476
we'll take you to Disneyland
in those pajamas.

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.312
Mama missed Papa too much...

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:45.774
and seemed to be living
between this world and the next.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:49.695
Everything's so hard.

01:21:49.905 --> 01:21:53.032
Your papa wanted you
to stay on the land.

01:21:53.283 --> 01:21:55.326
I can't. It's the past.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.578
Who will take care of the land?

01:21:58.038 --> 01:21:59.413
I'm old.

01:22:00.999 --> 01:22:02.499
Maybe Bon will come back.

01:22:03.084 --> 01:22:04.752
I know he will.

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.132
America, Mama.

01:22:10.383 --> 01:22:13.052
In America, I can save the children.

01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:16.096
The South is dying. Steve says...

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:18.974
it will fall faster
than anyone thinks.

01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:22.186
His mother and sister
are near San Diego...

01:22:22.395 --> 01:22:24.897
and he'll leave the Army soon
for a good job.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.149
He loves me.

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.403
I love him.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:33.030
You love him?

01:22:33.239 --> 01:22:34.281
Yes.

01:22:38.078 --> 01:22:39.954
He's good, Mama.

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:43.248
He loves the children.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.585
Americans are thu vo thuy vo chung.

01:22:47.504 --> 01:22:49.672
They have no beginning and no end.

01:22:49.881 --> 01:22:52.341
They don't care about their ancestors.

01:22:52.884 --> 01:22:56.470
So they think they are free
to do any bad thing they want.

01:22:57.597 --> 01:22:59.515
You will not be happy with this man.

01:23:00.725 --> 01:23:02.893
And your father's spirit
will not rest...

01:23:03.144 --> 01:23:05.688
till his most-loved child
sleeps in his house.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:24.331
- Where are we going?
- Just don't separate!

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.045
- What happened?
- They overran the base!

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:36.969
Don't separate!

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.363
Come on, come on!

01:23:56.573 --> 01:23:59.533
- Come on! Get everybody!
- Wait! Jimmy!

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:01.702
It's all right!

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.040
- Wait! Our things!
- There's no time! Get up there!

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.710
Take that, okay? Goodbye.

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:11.462
Steve, we gotta go!

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.257
Get the fuck out of here!

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:49.958
- This is the end of the line.
- But Saigon!

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:54.797
- You're getting out of here.
- You say you take us Saigon!

01:24:55.006 --> 01:24:56.381
No, come on! Go!

01:25:00.386 --> 01:25:02.596
You son of a bitch! Fuck you!

01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:04.264
Get out of here.

01:25:23.993 --> 01:25:27.121
My family was now blown
to the four winds.

01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:31.500
But on the road out of Qui Nhon,
I realized I was not alone.

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:35.546
My whole country was collapsing.

01:25:55.608 --> 01:25:56.984
Just be calm.

01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:13.393
Butler! Butler!

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:17.564
Steven J?

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:21.109
He's listed as missing in action.
Come back tomorrow.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:24.404
Batowski! Anyone for Batowski?

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:29.076
Ticket, American plane, $2000.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:33.705
You come with me, American man
give beaucoup greenback.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:37.668
For dollars. I got 10,000 piastres.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:14.037
Look! It's Daddy!

01:28:38.521 --> 01:28:40.439
How are you doing, boy?

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.922
It was everything I dreamed of.

01:29:06.341 --> 01:29:07.674
America.

01:29:12.221 --> 01:29:16.308
Big skies, and giant people
crushed me in their arms.

01:29:16.934 --> 01:29:20.312
And best of all was
my husband, Steve Butler.

01:29:20.563 --> 01:29:22.397
Marine Sergeant Butler.

01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:24.274
Here it is. The dream begins.

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:27.569
In his big, craggy face
was everything...

01:29:27.820 --> 01:29:30.030
I loved about America.

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:33.575
Played football with the guy
that lived in that house.

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:36.578
My first girlfriend lived
in this house.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.663
She was a real dog.

01:29:40.375 --> 01:29:42.167
You make me happy.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:45.504
You make me very happy.

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:53.887
He's here! They're early!

01:29:54.138 --> 01:29:55.680
She's so cute.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.516
Like a little China doll.

01:29:58.434 --> 01:30:00.977
Oh, I just want to hug you to pieces!

01:30:02.980 --> 01:30:03.980
And the kids!

01:30:05.108 --> 01:30:06.983
I'm just gonna eat you up!

01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:09.569
Hi, honey!

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:12.489
Home port. Lock and load!
There's Ma.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:13.865
- My baby!
- How are you?

01:30:14.117 --> 01:30:16.201
You can sure tell which is Steve's.

01:30:16.452 --> 01:30:17.828
That's Le Ly.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:21.248
I'm so happy to meet you, honey.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:26.086
The boys.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:27.671
Come on in.

01:30:34.387 --> 01:30:36.138
Look at this!

01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.978
Not bad, huh? It's ranch style.
We'll be here for a while.

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.147
But soon we'll get our own place.

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:48.400
- When did you get back?
- Last night. We got a C-130...

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:51.027
- How was the flight?
- Long, you know.

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:55.323
- Must've been terrible there.
- We don't wanna talk about that now.

01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:57.284
We'll talk about that later.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:31:00.662
I've got steak and baked potatoes
all planned, sweetie...

01:31:00.913 --> 01:31:02.622
just like you like it.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:07.043
And chocolate ice cream. Does that
sound nice? Do you eat that too?

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.920
I prepare tea if you show me kitchen.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:12.424
No, I'm supposed to do that.
You're the guest.

01:31:12.884 --> 01:31:13.884
Come on, this way.

01:31:17.513 --> 01:31:20.849
You hungry, Ly? You mind
if I call you Ly for short?

01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:32.486
Let's see, for dinner we have...

01:31:33.404 --> 01:31:35.530
steak, potatoes...

01:31:35.781 --> 01:31:36.781
peas.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:39.201
For dessert, strawberries.

01:31:39.452 --> 01:31:41.453
We'll have you back
to normal in no time.

01:31:48.961 --> 01:31:53.131
The meat will take more work,
but we've got that under control.

01:31:55.343 --> 01:31:56.384
Isn't that magic?

01:32:08.898 --> 01:32:11.858
Bless us, O Lord, and Thy
gifts which we are about to receive.

01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:15.028
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:21.910
- Were the bugs bad?
- Oh, yeah.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:26.373
- What about drugs?
- Some guys got involved, some didn't.

01:32:26.582 --> 01:32:30.001
- My Stevie wouldn't do anything bad.
- No way.

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:31.795
Johnny got killed.

01:32:33.464 --> 01:32:35.966
Le Ly, you got such pretty hair.

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:42.305
Then we got an R and R in Australia.
You should see those beaches.

01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:44.849
Was the money as good as they say?

01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:47.143
$14,000, I socked away.

01:32:47.395 --> 01:32:52.148
Combat pay, overseas pay, the best.
I'd go for another year, if I could.

01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.692
I guess it's over, though.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:55.318
Beverly's been calling.

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:00.782
I'm sure she wants it all too.

01:33:01.367 --> 01:33:02.993
Three more years.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.078
Then I'm in fat city.

01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:09.541
- How are the kids?
- Great. You gotta call in.

01:33:09.792 --> 01:33:11.334
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:33:11.544 --> 01:33:13.253
John's having trouble in school...

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:16.131
Yeah, look,
I'll get right on it, okay?

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:18.133
Can we just relax here?

01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:22.012
I'm sure Lee Lay's
really jet-lagged out.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:23.680
Aren't you, honey?

01:33:24.348 --> 01:33:26.182
You drink too much.

01:33:27.226 --> 01:33:28.643
You forgot my name.

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:31.646
I'm sorry, Le Ly.

01:33:33.524 --> 01:33:35.525
He was always slow in school.

01:33:44.535 --> 01:33:47.329
Just think of it as a Saigon taxi.
Just a rental.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.998
My personal vehicle's in the shop.

01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:55.128
You know, I understand about money.

01:33:55.796 --> 01:33:58.256
You in Marines a long time now...

01:33:58.507 --> 01:34:00.216
and you live with your mother.

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:04.179
The problem is Beverly.
She gets half my paycheck.

01:34:05.222 --> 01:34:07.682
Plus child support,
and she's still pissed.

01:34:08.351 --> 01:34:10.268
I'm in debt to the credit union...

01:34:10.519 --> 01:34:14.356
for a loan they made me in '67.
I'm practically bankrupt.

01:34:17.735 --> 01:34:21.571
I got three more years,
I'll get out with a good pension.

01:34:21.822 --> 01:34:24.574
Then I got a civilian job
waiting for me. Big bucks.

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:28.286
Just you and me. We're gonna
be back in the Far East.

01:34:29.705 --> 01:34:30.830
Indonesia...

01:34:31.082 --> 01:34:32.290
Singapore.

01:34:34.377 --> 01:34:38.546
Could be making 65,000 bucks
a year, guaranteed.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:39.964
Promised to me.

01:34:41.300 --> 01:34:42.634
What this job?

01:34:42.885 --> 01:34:46.054
I can't tell you. Not just yet.
It's confidential.

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:48.890
But I guarantee it'll work out.

01:34:57.900 --> 01:34:59.401
For your casserole...

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:03.321
we are featuring
the 8-ounce can of Spam.

01:35:05.449 --> 01:35:08.660
We need to go back to aisle
three where that cute guy is.

01:35:08.911 --> 01:35:11.746
- He'd make a cute snack.
- Yeah, great buns on him!

01:35:30.641 --> 01:35:31.891
Pick one.

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:35.478
Uncle Ben, I think.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:37.731
Uncle trusted man.

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:43.778
No, we're not feeding the village.

01:35:44.029 --> 01:35:46.531
Bernice doesn't even like this stuff.

01:35:46.782 --> 01:35:48.783
This is America, baby.

01:35:49.034 --> 01:35:51.911
Store stays open 24 hours.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.385
You don't need money in America.

01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:10.847
You just give this paper
to the bank, and the bank pays.

01:36:18.898 --> 01:36:20.523
They don't get it.

01:36:20.858 --> 01:36:22.150
I do.

01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:31.117
We'll lick them together.

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.037
We'll lick them together.

01:36:37.958 --> 01:36:41.127
Thank you, Lord, for watching
over us and giving us...

01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:43.630
these things
for which we are grateful.

01:36:43.881 --> 01:36:46.591
In the name of the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen.

01:36:50.387 --> 01:36:52.055
It was on a Danang street.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.599
Her girlfriend tried to rip me off.

01:36:54.850 --> 01:36:58.645
I had one like that in Okinawa. She
had thighs like that turkey.

01:36:58.896 --> 01:36:59.976
Cracked coconuts with them.

01:37:00.189 --> 01:37:02.023
Wait, it's not what you think.

01:37:02.274 --> 01:37:05.860
I chased her like a starving ARVIN,
hunting a grain of rice.

01:37:06.111 --> 01:37:07.111
Horseshit.

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:11.157
Don't run off with your filthy,
dirty, salacious mind.

01:37:11.742 --> 01:37:15.370
Don't give yourself a headache.
You and me are peas in a pod.

01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:19.582
Oriental women will tell you what
you wanna hear, do what you wanna do.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:22.418
But if you wanna believe that,
I'll salute you.

01:37:22.670 --> 01:37:27.006
What are you saying? Oriental women
are also very fucking loyal.

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:31.928
Have a drink. All I'm trying
to say is, more power to you, buddy.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.473
Come on, Ly, it's
Thanksgiving. You can eat.

01:37:35.724 --> 01:37:37.851
Think of the starving Vietnamese.

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.563
Leave her alone.
She always eats like a sparrow.

01:37:41.814 --> 01:37:43.690
Rice and fish, fish and rice...

01:37:43.941 --> 01:37:47.527
that's all the kids ever get.
They're starving for meat.

01:37:47.820 --> 01:37:51.322
Give her a break. She can't eat
for her whole damn country.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:55.159
I want her to know we're being
generous. I want her to be grateful.

01:37:55.411 --> 01:37:57.203
Let me tell you about grateful.

01:37:57.454 --> 01:38:01.916
We'd go to villages, and the first thing
old men and women said to us was:

01:38:03.919 --> 01:38:06.004
"Please, sir, don't kill me."

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:09.257
In Danang, we'd drive
past hospitals...

01:38:09.508 --> 01:38:11.718
past people our bombs
had blown to bits.

01:38:12.344 --> 01:38:14.053
And they'd wave.

01:38:14.638 --> 01:38:15.805
Boys and girls...

01:38:16.056 --> 01:38:19.934
with no arms, no legs, waving at us
like tourists going to the beach.

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:21.853
Why?

01:38:22.521 --> 01:38:26.274
Because they're happy to be alive
and glad to see us.

01:38:26.525 --> 01:38:28.109
We put them where they were.

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:31.988
And there's 20 of them dead
or mutilated for every one of us.

01:38:32.239 --> 01:38:35.783
So don't expect Ly to do handstands
over your goddamn turkey.

01:38:36.952 --> 01:38:41.664
She knows exactly what she's got,
and she knows what she's left behind.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:47.629
- Excuse me, baby brother.
- Steve is right.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.130
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler.

01:38:51.133 --> 01:38:52.592
Goddamn.

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:55.553
It's time the kids slept
in their own bed.

01:38:57.806 --> 01:39:00.266
They more loving
when they stay with us.

01:39:00.809 --> 01:39:03.728
Who going to protect them
from evil spirits?

01:39:03.979 --> 01:39:06.814
Look, it ain't Vietnam
in this bedroom.

01:39:07.066 --> 01:39:08.399
It's California.

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:11.319
How can I even see you
across all these bodies?

01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:14.447
Kids sleep alone.
Makes them more independent.

01:39:18.535 --> 01:39:21.704
You Le Ly hero.
Tonight, you protect Le Ly.

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:23.206
You good man.

01:39:23.457 --> 01:39:25.458
Just too much whiskey.

01:39:30.756 --> 01:39:32.131
Steve?

01:39:33.175 --> 01:39:34.759
Steve.

01:39:35.552 --> 01:39:38.388
I want to go work.
I want make money.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:40.848
I want get out of here, out of house.

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.977
Your family like their dogs
better than our boys.

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:46.145
What will you do, anyway?

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:47.563
Work factory.

01:39:47.815 --> 01:39:51.859
Restaurant. There plenty
Oriental restaurant growing here.

01:39:52.861 --> 01:39:54.654
I'd like to go back to Vietnam.

01:39:54.905 --> 01:39:57.156
Make a bundle.

01:39:57.408 --> 01:40:00.284
I'll tell you the truth,
I kind of miss it, in a way.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:04.205
What this job they want you do
for so much money?

01:40:05.541 --> 01:40:07.792
It's just between you and me, okay?

01:40:08.711 --> 01:40:13.214
Government has rules about what jobs
you can do after what I've done.

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.134
- What this job?
- It's arms.

01:40:17.386 --> 01:40:18.886
Selling arms.

01:40:19.888 --> 01:40:20.930
I don't understand.

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:23.850
You know, guns? Sell guns.

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.520
You joking?

01:40:27.771 --> 01:40:32.400
What do you think I did the last 17
years? What do military advisors do?

01:40:32.651 --> 01:40:35.611
I go to countries and teach them
how to use weapons...

01:40:35.863 --> 01:40:37.697
that our corporations sell.

01:40:37.948 --> 01:40:42.827
How can you go sell guns to government
that blow up women and children?

01:40:43.912 --> 01:40:46.622
If we didn't sell them,
the Communists would.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:49.250
And how would they
or we be better off?

01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:50.501
Guns! Communists!

01:40:51.628 --> 01:40:53.713
Is that all Americans think about?

01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:58.718
It's the only thing I know how to do.
At least I'll make money doing it.

01:40:58.969 --> 01:41:02.013
Do you ever listen
to anything Le Ly tell you?

01:41:02.264 --> 01:41:03.556
Oh, shit.

01:41:04.183 --> 01:41:06.350
You mean the Buddhist stuff.

01:41:06.602 --> 01:41:07.685
Not just that!

01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:10.646
I mean my family, my life.

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:19.947
We don't know anything
about each other, Steve.

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:23.076
You lied to me in Vietnam.

01:41:25.412 --> 01:41:27.288
No, it wasn't a lie...

01:41:28.290 --> 01:41:29.540
exactly.

01:41:31.835 --> 01:41:35.004
It was a white lie. A good lie.

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:38.424
Come on, baby, don't do this.

01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:41.886
Come on, please.
I love you, darling.

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:08.037
Much against Steve's wishes,
I found a job...

01:42:08.288 --> 01:42:10.832
working in
a circuit board factory.

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:17.547
I know the girls well,
so I borrowed 5000.

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:22.677
I need 10,000 to open a little deli
in a neighborhood with many immigrants.

01:42:23.637 --> 01:42:26.639
Vietnamese never trust bank.
Loan money to each other.

01:42:26.849 --> 01:42:28.307
- You winning?
- Of course.

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:29.642
Can I borrow money?

01:42:31.019 --> 01:42:33.563
I think I'll make
a $1400 profit a month.

01:42:33.814 --> 01:42:35.982
I did not tell Steve.
He would be angry.

01:42:36.233 --> 01:42:38.359
He didn't like
my starting a business.

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:40.153
This one, I don't know about.

01:42:40.404 --> 01:42:42.864
Those cost me 5000 in Vietnam.

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:45.449
Take it back to Vietnam.

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.368
I'm opening a restaurant.

01:42:47.619 --> 01:42:51.330
Steve want to give me money,
control me. But I used to working...

01:42:51.582 --> 01:42:55.710
having my own money. But in
America, he want me be housewife.

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.461
So I wear two hats.

01:42:58.255 --> 01:42:59.964
I'm lucky? What do you mean?

01:43:00.215 --> 01:43:03.217
You told me two years!
We had an agreement! Not one!

01:43:03.635 --> 01:43:05.178
No, no, no.

01:43:05.387 --> 01:43:09.682
Two years, not $10,000.
$20,000.

01:43:09.933 --> 01:43:11.267
I don't think so!

01:43:11.518 --> 01:43:14.437
I put in air conditioner!
I clean electric wiring!

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.731
I remodel! I put up shelves!

01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:19.984
I should pay 10,000 for two years,
and you know it!

01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:26.157
When I tell Steve, we have
a big fight, then more fights.

01:43:29.328 --> 01:43:30.870
Hung, now Jimmy...

01:43:31.121 --> 01:43:34.790
break my heart when he refused
to speak Vietnamese with me...

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:37.960
as did Tommy
and our new son, Alan.

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:41.547
In school, because of the war,
they said they were Mexican.

01:43:41.798 --> 01:43:43.090
I won't sign it.

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:44.759
Fine. No sign.

01:43:45.010 --> 01:43:48.012
I was starting to behave
like an American...

01:43:48.847 --> 01:43:51.390
yelling back at my husband,
frowns, scowls.

01:43:51.642 --> 01:43:54.310
And all the time
you spend at the temple!

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.812
Steve was drinking more...

01:43:57.064 --> 01:44:00.358
and seemed unhappy with his job
at the Marine base.

01:44:00.609 --> 01:44:02.193
Buddha don't know shit!

01:44:02.444 --> 01:44:05.863
There was another side
to Steve now I had not seen before.

01:44:06.573 --> 01:44:11.035
He speak angry words now.
All blood and thunder words.

01:44:13.205 --> 01:44:15.581
She's a bitch.
What do you want me to say?

01:44:16.124 --> 01:44:17.667
She wants more!

01:44:17.918 --> 01:44:21.504
No reason. Money goes like water
around here. I got five kids...

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:23.089
including your bastard.

01:44:23.715 --> 01:44:27.593
Marine Corps owns my body and my soul.
I got nothing of my own!

01:44:27.844 --> 01:44:31.180
Then why use $400
on two more guns? Why?

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:34.141
Still bitching about money
like a gook?

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:37.645
Don't call me that.
You have no right!

01:44:37.896 --> 01:44:41.816
These are valuable. I can sell them
for twice what I got in them.

01:44:42.067 --> 01:44:44.527
They could be the only thing
between you and death.

01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:46.404
Death? Death from who?

01:44:46.822 --> 01:44:49.615
You the only person
who waves gun around here...

01:44:49.866 --> 01:44:51.367
who drinks and shoots!

01:44:51.618 --> 01:44:55.621
Don't tell me what I should or
shouldn't have. They're my sons too...

01:44:55.872 --> 01:44:58.165
and I'll teach them
to hunt and shoot!

01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.543
They'll learn to survive.

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:03.838
No way, buddy. You will not
teach my sons to shoot!

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:06.716
I see too many guns in my lifetime.

01:45:06.967 --> 01:45:11.262
Killing no way to protect anything!
I don't want guns in my house!

01:45:11.513 --> 01:45:14.974
No more. You want them, you get out!

01:45:15.892 --> 01:45:16.934
Fuck you...

01:45:17.769 --> 01:45:19.520
you lying little bitch!

01:45:20.230 --> 01:45:22.523
Don't tell me to go.
I read your letter.

01:45:22.774 --> 01:45:23.941
What letter?

01:45:24.192 --> 01:45:28.487
The one from your dink lover.
I saw it stashed in your purse.

01:45:28.739 --> 01:45:29.780
Anh?

01:45:30.282 --> 01:45:32.033
You went through my things?

01:45:32.284 --> 01:45:34.577
What's he writing you
in Vietnamese about?

01:45:36.038 --> 01:45:37.455
He want you back?

01:45:39.249 --> 01:45:40.416
No.

01:45:40.625 --> 01:45:41.959
He asked about Jimmy.

01:45:42.210 --> 01:45:43.627
I send him pictures...

01:45:44.254 --> 01:45:45.755
answer his questions.

01:45:45.964 --> 01:45:47.256
- That's all.
- Bullshit!

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:50.718
Lying bitch!

01:45:51.636 --> 01:45:52.928
Steve.

01:45:53.180 --> 01:45:55.639
One time, I think I love you.

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:59.101
But I see now we're too different
inside to be soul mates.

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:02.063
No more mistake now.

01:46:02.272 --> 01:46:04.065
Not with children so young.

01:46:09.571 --> 01:46:12.114
Are you saying you wanna divorce me?

01:46:13.825 --> 01:46:15.159
Is that it?

01:46:15.410 --> 01:46:16.535
One thing I learn.

01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:19.372
In marriage, just one person
can't be happy.

01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:21.207
One miserable, both miserable.

01:46:21.416 --> 01:46:23.125
That the way life works.

01:46:23.335 --> 01:46:24.335
Oh, no, baby.

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:26.003
This is the way life works!

01:46:26.713 --> 01:46:27.963
Oh, my God!

01:46:33.512 --> 01:46:34.720
Steve.

01:46:42.562 --> 01:46:45.731
I felt my soul would go then,
any moment.

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:49.860
God is not cruel...

01:46:50.654 --> 01:46:51.779
just practical.

01:46:53.156 --> 01:46:54.198
In this life...

01:46:54.658 --> 01:46:57.076
sometimes against all knowledge...

01:46:57.285 --> 01:47:00.162
we're paying back for
a lot of bad past lives.

01:47:07.087 --> 01:47:08.629
I can't.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:25.062
I can't live without you!

01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:29.859
They got me so tied up.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:34.113
Who's doing this to you?

01:47:34.448 --> 01:47:36.073
The Marine Corps.

01:47:38.076 --> 01:47:41.245
I'm not gonna get the civilian job
I promised you.

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:45.541
I'm up for an Admin Board,
and they're gonna kick me out.

01:47:46.209 --> 01:47:48.461
You don't know the half of it,
darling.

01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:52.214
- You don't know the half of it.
- Tell me.

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.091
You must tell me all.

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:56.302
You feel better.

01:47:57.721 --> 01:47:59.180
I'm a killer.

01:48:00.432 --> 01:48:02.349
I killed so many over there.

01:48:04.394 --> 01:48:08.230
I got so good at it, they assigned me
to the projects.

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:10.107
Black Ops.

01:48:10.317 --> 01:48:12.776
We killed sometimes
three or four a night.

01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:14.320
All kinds.

01:48:14.571 --> 01:48:16.238
Rice farmers...

01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:20.201
rich fat cats
bankrolling the VC unit.

01:48:21.077 --> 01:48:22.870
It was a complete mind fuck.

01:48:23.121 --> 01:48:26.624
Psy ops, rip a man's guts out,
take a bite out of his liver...

01:48:26.875 --> 01:48:29.752
drop it on his chest
so he don't go to Buddha heaven.

01:48:29.961 --> 01:48:31.837
Leave him laying in the road.

01:48:32.506 --> 01:48:34.340
Cut his nuts off...

01:48:34.591 --> 01:48:39.261
stuff them in his mouth, sew up
his lips, leave him laying in his bed.

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:43.682
Blame it on the VC, I didn't care.

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:46.977
Drugs, running guns, slavery.

01:48:48.271 --> 01:48:50.189
You name it.

01:48:51.441 --> 01:48:54.318
One time, this guy killed
a gook girl I was...

01:48:54.569 --> 01:48:56.028
shacking with.

01:48:57.405 --> 01:49:01.283
We weren't to fraternize with
Viet nationals outside channels...

01:49:01.535 --> 01:49:05.204
so they killed her,
they cut her throat from ear to ear.

01:49:06.122 --> 01:49:07.790
I was in hell, baby.

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:10.584
I was in pure...

01:49:11.294 --> 01:49:12.628
hell.

01:49:15.298 --> 01:49:18.551
And maybe I went dinky dau over there.

01:49:20.095 --> 01:49:22.638
Maybe I am nuts, who the fuck knows?

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:27.268
The more I killed,
the more they gave me to kill.

01:49:27.602 --> 01:49:30.563
You know what it's like?
It's like being eaten alive...

01:49:31.147 --> 01:49:34.817
from the inside out by sharks.
You gotta keep hitting and moving...

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:38.946
because if you stop,
the sharks will eat you alive.

01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:48.831
One day, they cut me off.

01:49:50.667 --> 01:49:52.960
Then one day, I found you.

01:49:53.336 --> 01:49:56.797
And it all changed, I thought.
But, baby...

01:49:57.048 --> 01:49:59.341
nothing ever changes.

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:02.595
So fuck me, right?

01:50:08.893 --> 01:50:10.769
No, no, no.

01:50:17.569 --> 01:50:19.278
It's okay.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.706
What's gonna happen to me, baby?
I'm scared to death.

01:50:34.628 --> 01:50:36.712
I don't know.

01:50:41.092 --> 01:50:44.053
I too was a soldier in past lives.

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.389
I hurt many people.

01:50:50.018 --> 01:50:52.227
I lied, I stealed...

01:50:52.479 --> 01:50:54.104
I hate.

01:50:55.732 --> 01:50:57.399
Now I pay.

01:50:59.152 --> 01:51:01.904
Soldiers try to kill my life.

01:51:02.155 --> 01:51:05.741
Long time, I have no man love me.

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:07.743
No respect.

01:51:09.245 --> 01:51:10.788
It's my fate.

01:51:16.127 --> 01:51:18.212
We're the same, Steve.

01:51:18.546 --> 01:51:21.006
We have made bad karma.

01:51:21.216 --> 01:51:24.426
And our soul debt will come due,
if not in this life...

01:51:24.636 --> 01:51:26.387
then in another.

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:29.306
But we can't give up.

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.558
We must try.

01:51:36.106 --> 01:51:38.190
Different skin...

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:42.611
same suffering.

01:51:48.159 --> 01:51:50.202
Can you love me?

01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:55.874
Can you really love me?

01:52:10.473 --> 01:52:13.016
Oh, my baby.

01:52:19.983 --> 01:52:23.610
But the fights continued
and continued.

01:52:25.029 --> 01:52:27.156
Finally I went to see a lawyer.

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:32.953
In my heart, I thought I did not
belong in this country.

01:52:33.663 --> 01:52:35.998
And I thought of going home again.

01:52:43.256 --> 01:52:45.841
He's not supposed to be
taking furniture.

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:49.720
You better call your lawyer.

01:52:50.722 --> 01:52:53.348
No, it's okay, Sharon. Let him.

01:52:54.476 --> 01:52:57.728
That's what a divorce is.
That's when you divide everything.

01:52:58.229 --> 01:53:00.272
- Not now...
- Please.

01:53:00.523 --> 01:53:01.732
Let him go.

01:53:07.864 --> 01:53:08.947
Eat up.

01:53:17.123 --> 01:53:19.041
Daddy, you're back.

01:53:20.710 --> 01:53:22.711
- What you doing here?
- It's Sunday.

01:53:22.921 --> 01:53:25.756
- I came to take the kids to Mass.
- I don't think so.

01:53:27.008 --> 01:53:29.885
Get the hell out of the way!

01:53:30.136 --> 01:53:32.012
Jimmy, come!

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:39.436
- What're you doing?
- I'm going too.

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:43.607
No, you're not! You're gonna stay
right goddamn here and fix lunch!

01:53:58.248 --> 01:53:59.373
Steve, Steve.

01:54:01.626 --> 01:54:05.003
Lily, good to see you.
It's been far too long.

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:18.600
This is Steve.

01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:22.896
- How's Alan? Tommy?
- Fine. You wanna see them again?

01:54:23.147 --> 01:54:24.731
Of course! I'm worried sick!

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:26.191
The police want you.

01:54:26.442 --> 01:54:28.986
Fuck them. Do exactly what I tell you.

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:31.989
What do you want?

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:36.785
Write a letter to your bitch lawyer,
dropping the charges against me.

01:54:36.995 --> 01:54:39.746
Tell her you want the house
put into my name.

01:54:39.998 --> 01:54:43.584
Tell her you're dropping the divorce.
You listening to me?

01:54:44.335 --> 01:54:46.628
Yes, I'm listening.

01:54:47.839 --> 01:54:51.466
Get the letter notarized. Take it
to Father Bob. I'll call him.

01:54:52.302 --> 01:54:54.136
Do it, or you'll be sorry.

01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:57.014
You'll get the letter.
Just don't hurt them.

01:54:57.265 --> 01:55:00.559
They're ours.
They have our lives in them.

01:55:01.561 --> 01:55:03.312
You just get that letter.

01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.528
My boys.

01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:13.322
I birthed them with pain.

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:15.991
I chewed their food for them.

01:55:16.701 --> 01:55:18.118
I am shocked.

01:55:18.328 --> 01:55:20.871
I am insulted at the insolence of men.

01:55:22.123 --> 01:55:23.916
They don't respect women.

01:55:24.375 --> 01:55:28.378
I cannot believe such men
have known a mother's love.

01:55:30.673 --> 01:55:34.593
If I show you a tiny baby
killed by a bayonet...

01:55:34.844 --> 01:55:37.554
and say it is his karma...

01:55:39.307 --> 01:55:41.600
we may cry for the baby...

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:47.272
for the baby's karma and the
bad karma of the soldier who killed it.

01:55:50.234 --> 01:55:52.819
But we must never use our emotion...

01:55:53.905 --> 01:55:58.492
to deny the wheel of incarnation
that caused the act.

01:56:00.828 --> 01:56:02.663
It is as natural...

01:56:03.164 --> 01:56:04.623
as the movement...

01:56:04.874 --> 01:56:06.083
of the sun...

01:56:06.334 --> 01:56:07.334
and moon.

01:56:09.045 --> 01:56:10.087
Master...

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:15.425
how can I tell him we must be
friends and soul mates...

01:56:15.677 --> 01:56:17.844
without being husband and wife?

01:56:18.596 --> 01:56:22.599
He has created much soul debt
for himself.

01:56:25.603 --> 01:56:29.231
But if you fail to give him
the opportunity...

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.774
to redeem himself...

01:56:32.568 --> 01:56:36.488
you will only increase
your own soul debt.

01:56:38.282 --> 01:56:39.616
The man-hate...

01:56:39.867 --> 01:56:41.493
that blinds you...

01:56:41.911 --> 01:56:46.039
will blind any man you find
in a future life.

01:56:48.459 --> 01:56:50.335
If you turn Steve away...

01:56:51.504 --> 01:56:54.506
you will be rejecting
your own redemption.

01:56:59.053 --> 01:57:00.220
Child...

01:57:01.472 --> 01:57:04.224
you have forgiven the men...

01:57:04.642 --> 01:57:06.184
who raped you...

01:57:06.978 --> 01:57:08.645
destroyed your country...

01:57:09.313 --> 01:57:10.731
harmed your family.

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:14.359
This is how it should be.

01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:20.699
Your karma is mixed with Steve
to Tommy and Alan.

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:22.909
The future...

01:57:23.703 --> 01:57:24.953
the past...

01:57:25.204 --> 01:57:26.705
are all the same.

01:57:27.957 --> 01:57:29.624
If you divorce...

01:57:30.334 --> 01:57:33.962
you will only have to come back
again and work it out again.

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:38.675
The path to nirvana...

01:57:38.926 --> 01:57:41.261
is never being safe...

01:57:41.512 --> 01:57:43.930
but tricky and steep.

01:57:44.307 --> 01:57:47.476
And if you walk only on sunny days...

01:57:48.144 --> 01:57:51.354
you never reach your destination.

01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:55.567
Choose well...

01:57:56.194 --> 01:57:58.153
my peach blossom.

01:58:03.785 --> 01:58:06.161
A child without a father...

01:58:06.621 --> 01:58:10.415
is like a house without a roof.

01:58:29.393 --> 01:58:30.435
Hello?

01:58:31.020 --> 01:58:32.521
Listen carefully.

01:58:32.814 --> 01:58:37.317
My sister Kim came to America
and married Steve's military friend.

01:58:37.527 --> 01:58:41.530
Steve and the two boys are here now.
They're drinking.

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:45.158
He's getting ready to take them
to Canada.

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:46.785
The boys are upset.

01:58:46.994 --> 01:58:49.329
They don't wanna stay
with Steve anymore.

01:58:50.039 --> 01:58:51.373
Oh, fine, next Tuesday.

01:58:51.916 --> 01:58:55.085
- Whatever you want.
- Put Steve on. I must speak to him.

01:58:58.881 --> 01:59:01.925
Here. It's for you. Here.

01:59:03.427 --> 01:59:04.636
Let go, honey.

01:59:10.059 --> 01:59:11.101
Steve?

01:59:12.270 --> 01:59:16.148
Please, I know you hate me.
But I don't hate you.

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:18.900
Let me help you.

01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:21.111
Let me try.

01:59:22.155 --> 01:59:23.947
I feel your pain.

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:27.617
You come back home. No police.

01:59:28.077 --> 01:59:31.246
Just you, me, the children.

01:59:31.747 --> 01:59:33.373
We make this right.

01:59:34.333 --> 01:59:36.084
I'll go to your church.

01:59:37.295 --> 01:59:40.338
I try harder.
I'll put the shrine away.

01:59:42.633 --> 01:59:44.342
I love you, Steve.

01:59:47.513 --> 01:59:50.056
I love the man I saw in Vietnam.

01:59:54.478 --> 01:59:56.104
I find you again.

01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:00.984
He's still there, Steve.

02:00:03.738 --> 02:00:05.447
I still love you.

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:13.163
Steve, please.

02:00:28.846 --> 02:00:31.014
- You can't go in there.
- My children.

02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:36.186
They're all right! Steve...

02:00:37.313 --> 02:00:39.105
He killed himself.

02:01:13.891 --> 02:01:16.101
The spirits are here.

02:01:19.272 --> 02:01:21.314
Oh, this is marvelous.

02:01:24.652 --> 02:01:26.111
Your husband is here.

02:01:27.363 --> 02:01:29.239
He is a little shy.

02:01:30.741 --> 02:01:33.576
He doesn't want to come into the house.

02:01:35.413 --> 02:01:37.372
He's not used to this new world.

02:01:37.707 --> 02:01:39.666
He's in much pain.

02:01:40.293 --> 02:01:42.043
But he forgive you.

02:01:42.295 --> 02:01:43.712
He ask for you...

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:47.424
to take his soul
into the Buddhist temple.

02:01:49.218 --> 02:01:51.594
"Place me in the temple."

02:01:52.013 --> 02:01:53.638
As he finds peace...

02:01:53.889 --> 02:01:55.640
so will your family...

02:01:55.891 --> 02:01:58.685
and your children find peace.

02:02:00.563 --> 02:02:01.563
That's it.

02:02:04.692 --> 02:02:06.693
Are you sure that was Steve?

02:02:06.944 --> 02:02:09.112
He was such a strong Christian.

02:02:09.322 --> 02:02:10.697
Trust me.

02:02:11.032 --> 02:02:12.157
He change a lot.

02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:17.120
And by the way...

02:02:21.417 --> 02:02:23.084
This house...

02:02:23.461 --> 02:02:25.587
- What?
- Have to leave.

02:02:25.838 --> 02:02:27.047
No good.

02:02:28.049 --> 02:02:31.676
Your front door faces your back door.

02:02:32.261 --> 02:02:35.180
Everything that come into your life...

02:02:35.389 --> 02:02:38.141
the front way will go out the back.

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:39.768
Men...

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:41.269
money...

02:02:41.729 --> 02:02:42.937
happiness...

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.439
everything.

02:02:44.857 --> 02:02:46.441
Move fast.

02:02:54.241 --> 02:02:59.079
It was 13 years after the war
that I first returned to Vietnam.

02:02:59.997 --> 02:03:02.165
To the spirit of my father...

02:03:02.458 --> 02:03:06.628
to my sisters and brother Bon
who had survived the war...

02:03:07.254 --> 02:03:11.424
and to my mother,
who I had not spoken to in years.

02:03:12.259 --> 02:03:14.177
An ocean had come between us.

02:03:14.387 --> 02:03:18.348
But I feared it would be the last time
for my sons to see her.

02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:22.644
I had prospered in America, yes.

02:03:23.187 --> 02:03:26.689
I buy and rent houses,
became partner in a restaurant...

02:03:26.941 --> 02:03:29.609
working all the time,
losing touch as a mother.

02:03:30.361 --> 02:03:34.948
Affairs with different men,
none of whom touched my heart.

02:03:38.035 --> 02:03:40.245
Stopping in old Saigon first...

02:03:40.496 --> 02:03:42.122
now Ho Chi Minh City...

02:03:42.331 --> 02:03:47.252
my heart trembled with anticipation
as I took Jimmy to see his father...

02:03:47.545 --> 02:03:50.463
who, as a teenage girl,
I'd fallen madly in love with...

02:03:50.714 --> 02:03:52.882
twenty years before.

02:03:54.301 --> 02:03:55.677
Had he changed?

02:04:18.868 --> 02:04:19.909
Ahn.

02:04:21.912 --> 02:04:23.079
Be Ly.

02:04:26.876 --> 02:04:28.418
Don't you start that again.

02:04:40.347 --> 02:04:41.764
Papa.

02:06:15.276 --> 02:06:16.651
Mama.

02:06:20.197 --> 02:06:21.656
Be Ly.

02:06:25.202 --> 02:06:26.911
You look healthy.

02:06:29.039 --> 02:06:30.456
You're a ghost.

02:06:31.375 --> 02:06:32.792
I don't see you.

02:06:33.043 --> 02:06:34.877
I don't know where you are.

02:06:37.339 --> 02:06:39.340
How is your sister Kim?

02:06:41.051 --> 02:06:42.135
Fine.

02:06:44.138 --> 02:06:45.179
Fine.

02:06:48.934 --> 02:06:51.311
Your grandsons. My boys.

02:06:51.854 --> 02:06:53.563
Jimmy's Hung.

02:06:54.940 --> 02:06:56.899
Tommy's Chau.

02:06:57.568 --> 02:06:58.651
Alan.

02:06:59.028 --> 02:07:00.653
Born in America.

02:07:04.658 --> 02:07:06.034
What'd she say?

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:08.036
She says you're giant.

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:10.204
She can't believe your size.

02:07:10.748 --> 02:07:12.707
You used to scratch your back...

02:07:12.916 --> 02:07:14.959
on the wooden post in our house.

02:07:20.341 --> 02:07:22.592
- Look at her teeth!
- Stop that.

02:07:29.266 --> 02:07:30.475
Brother.

02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:32.727
Take a chocolate.

02:07:37.441 --> 02:07:38.816
School?

02:07:39.276 --> 02:07:42.028
School. I'm doing very good.

02:07:48.786 --> 02:07:51.079
Take one. Be polite.

02:07:52.456 --> 02:07:54.040
I'm sorry, I can't.

02:07:54.291 --> 02:07:55.833
Don't spoil the good time.

02:07:56.043 --> 02:07:59.879
My oldest son and my youngest daughter
are back with me.

02:08:00.089 --> 02:08:02.757
My two halves on either side.

02:08:03.008 --> 02:08:07.136
We share the same mother, I agree.
And I love her as a sister...

02:08:08.055 --> 02:08:10.515
but I cannot accept her gifts.

02:08:11.225 --> 02:08:15.520
I had this terrible fear
that you would despise me...

02:08:15.813 --> 02:08:20.316
because I married your enemy
and left while you were still fighting.

02:08:20.818 --> 02:08:23.111
It's been so many years.

02:08:23.821 --> 02:08:25.571
Much is forgiven.

02:08:26.573 --> 02:08:29.867
But you don't understand
how much suffering Americans caused.

02:08:31.245 --> 02:08:33.329
Things are very hard.

02:08:33.872 --> 02:08:37.208
We use our own excrement
to grow vegetables.

02:08:37.918 --> 02:08:40.837
All we had to hold on to was
the future...

02:08:41.171 --> 02:08:45.633
because we knew that future
would not arrive unless we won.

02:08:47.094 --> 02:08:50.138
So we kept dying, no matter what...

02:08:50.973 --> 02:08:54.225
just like ants beneath
the elephant's feet.

02:08:56.145 --> 02:08:58.438
It wasn't because we were brave.

02:08:58.647 --> 02:09:00.773
Because we had no choice.

02:09:01.692 --> 02:09:03.860
Our freedom was all...

02:09:04.778 --> 02:09:06.487
all that mattered.

02:09:08.532 --> 02:09:10.950
But when the future finally came...

02:09:11.452 --> 02:09:13.202
there was more war...

02:09:13.579 --> 02:09:17.081
the Cambodians, the Chinese.

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:21.794
When I came to look for Mama
in 1980...

02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:25.381
you have no idea how much
your mother suffered.

02:09:26.008 --> 02:09:28.801
She was too old to work the paddies.

02:09:29.303 --> 02:09:34.432
She had to give the land, our land,
to the state after liberation.

02:09:35.267 --> 02:09:39.020
When I found Mama and Hai,
they were starving.

02:09:39.229 --> 02:09:42.648
Their clothes were rags,
their farm tools were stolen...

02:09:42.858 --> 02:09:44.609
the animals slaughtered.

02:09:44.818 --> 02:09:46.444
The house was in ruins.

02:09:46.695 --> 02:09:48.696
Some wild dogs attacked them.

02:09:49.448 --> 02:09:51.824
Nobody in the village cared for them.

02:09:52.034 --> 02:09:54.118
They're just two old ladies
scavenging...

02:09:54.328 --> 02:09:57.079
and growing vegetables
to stay alive.

02:09:58.081 --> 02:10:00.082
Now you come here...

02:10:00.751 --> 02:10:02.668
a rich, strange foreigner.

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:05.713
You'll turn the village
against them...

02:10:06.173 --> 02:10:08.007
and against us...

02:10:09.676 --> 02:10:13.971
the Phungs,
who have suffered so much.

02:10:16.016 --> 02:10:19.393
Things were bad for everyone
after liberation.

02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:26.108
Many times, heaven and earth
changed places.

02:10:26.610 --> 02:10:29.237
If you ask me, rebuilding
a nation after a war...

02:10:29.446 --> 02:10:32.782
is like trying to start a family
by getting raped!

02:10:35.410 --> 02:10:39.288
If war produces one thing,
it's many cemeteries.

02:10:40.457 --> 02:10:43.709
And in cemeteries there are no enemies.

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:07.483
All I could think of for so long...

02:11:07.901 --> 02:11:10.611
was how I made your brother Sau
go to war.

02:11:11.071 --> 02:11:15.658
Your father wanted your brother to know
some of the joys of married life...

02:11:15.868 --> 02:11:19.370
but I said no, so sure I was
doing the right thing.

02:11:20.497 --> 02:11:25.126
Can you believe it? I gave up
a grandson to gain a soldier.

02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:27.336
And I lost both.

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:30.006
How wrong I was.

02:11:30.757 --> 02:11:33.426
It was also anh Sau's choice.

02:11:34.678 --> 02:11:37.889
He was just being a good son
when he obeyed me.

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:43.060
If I could, I would have stopped you
from going to America.

02:11:44.271 --> 02:11:46.814
What would've happened
to your sons here?

02:11:52.154 --> 02:11:54.697
I'm so proud of you, be Ly.

02:11:55.532 --> 02:11:59.827
You've grown up to see the side of
things that's hidden from most people.

02:12:09.171 --> 02:12:12.340
Tears are God's way
of paying you back...

02:12:12.549 --> 02:12:14.133
for what He's taken.

02:12:15.385 --> 02:12:17.470
I have no more tears.

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:21.891
I have cried them out
to all directions of the wind.

02:12:23.226 --> 02:12:25.311
My color's changing, Ly.

02:12:25.979 --> 02:12:27.688
It began last year.

02:12:28.398 --> 02:12:30.983
I have seen it before in others.

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:36.530
You have come back,
and that's what matters.

02:12:37.741 --> 02:12:40.743
You have completed
your circle of growth.

02:12:41.495 --> 02:12:43.746
Low tide to high tide...

02:12:43.997 --> 02:12:45.831
poor to rich...

02:12:46.166 --> 02:12:48.250
sad to happy...

02:12:49.169 --> 02:12:51.712
beggar to a fine lady.

02:12:53.715 --> 02:12:56.258
Your past is now complete...

02:12:57.678 --> 02:13:01.222
and my destiny as your mother
is now over.

02:13:08.146 --> 02:13:10.856
I'm looking forward to
joining your papa.

02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:22.618
That night, I slept
in the house my father built.

02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:39.635
Afterward, he found no need
to visit me in my dreams.

02:13:48.437 --> 02:13:51.981
I gave my offerings to all the dead
of the village.

02:14:08.999 --> 02:14:12.084
I had come home, yes.

02:14:12.961 --> 02:14:15.087
But home had changed...

02:14:16.089 --> 02:14:18.632
and I would always be in between...

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:20.634
South, North...

02:14:21.053 --> 02:14:22.595
East, West...

02:14:22.888 --> 02:14:24.305
peace, war...

02:14:25.057 --> 02:14:27.558
Vietnam, America.

02:14:28.143 --> 02:14:33.189
It is my fate to be in between
heaven and earth.

02:14:34.107 --> 02:14:37.234
When we resist our fate, we suffer.

02:14:37.444 --> 02:14:40.196
When we accept it, we are happy.

02:14:40.697 --> 02:14:43.949
We have time in abundance,
an eternity...

02:14:44.201 --> 02:14:46.077
to repeat our mistakes.

02:14:46.328 --> 02:14:49.497
But we need only once correct
our mistake...

02:14:49.748 --> 02:14:52.291
and at last hear
the song of enlightenment...

02:14:52.501 --> 02:14:56.128
with which we can break
the chain of vengeance forever.

02:14:58.507 --> 02:15:01.008
In your heart, you can hear it now.

02:15:01.551 --> 02:15:06.055
It's the song your spirit has been
singing since the moment of your birth.

02:15:07.808 --> 02:15:09.391
If the monks were right...

02:15:09.643 --> 02:15:12.103
and nothing happens
without cause...

02:15:12.312 --> 02:15:16.190
then the gift of suffering is
to bring us closer to God...

02:15:16.566 --> 02:15:19.318
to teach us to be strong
when we are weak...

02:15:19.569 --> 02:15:22.321
to be brave when we are afraid...

02:15:22.531 --> 02:15:25.449
to be wise in the midst
of confusion...

02:15:25.659 --> 02:15:29.203
and to let go of that
which we can no longer hold.

02:15:31.498 --> 02:15:34.375
Lasting victories are won
in the heart...

02:15:35.127 --> 02:15:37.419
not on this land or that.
