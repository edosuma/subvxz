[theme music]

00:12.046 --> 00:13.981
BECKY: Hey, who stole my bacon?

00:14.082 --> 00:14.948
DARLENE: Don't look at me.

00:15.049 --> 00:15.983
I don't eat meat anymore.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.086
ROSEANNE: Give it back, DJ.

00:18.186 --> 00:19.019
BECKY: Oh, Mom!

00:19.120 --> 00:19.953
He licked it!

00:20.054 --> 00:20.888
DJ: I did not!

00:20.988 --> 00:21.989
BECKY: Well, it's all slimy!

00:22.090 --> 00:23.091
ROSEANNE: Would
you guys shut up?

00:23.191 --> 00:24.625
Your dad's in there
trying to sleep!

00:28.096 --> 00:30.631
Now here, give me
that bacon he licked,

00:30.731 --> 00:31.799
and I'll feed it to your dad.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.471
Now, you know what to do, right?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.039
You pick DJ up from
school, and then

00:39.140 --> 00:40.541
take him to soccer
practice, and then

00:40.641 --> 00:42.410
come pick me up at the mall.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.345
Jeez, why don't you just
buy me, like, a chauffeur

00:44.445 --> 00:47.047
jacket and a little cap?

00:47.148 --> 00:49.417
You know, that's all I
ever hear from you, isn't it?

00:49.517 --> 00:50.418
I need new clothes.

00:50.518 --> 00:51.352
Buy me a hat.

00:51.452 --> 00:52.986
Buy me a jacket.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.155
Me, me, me.

00:59.627 --> 01:01.762
I thought you were sleeping.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.098
What and miss hearing my
family scream at the top

01:04.198 --> 01:05.099
of their lungs in the morning?

01:10.138 --> 01:12.406
Well, you know, it's
breakfast time, Dan.

01:12.506 --> 01:13.507
I did my best.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.378
Gee, you should be
thankful nobody was hurt.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.980
Oh, is this big pile of
dirty clothes on the floor

01:20.080 --> 01:21.282
here for me?

01:21.382 --> 01:22.683
Oh, honey!

01:22.783 --> 01:26.554
And it's not even my birthday.

01:26.654 --> 01:27.455
It was late.

01:27.555 --> 01:28.856
I was tired.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.658
I was gonna pick 'em up in the
morning after a full four hours

01:30.758 --> 01:32.626
sleep.

01:32.726 --> 01:33.861
Where's the towels?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.229
In the washer.

01:35.329 --> 01:36.964
DAN: What are they
doing in there?

01:37.064 --> 01:39.267
They're taking a ride.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.535
How am I supposed
to take a shower?

01:41.635 --> 01:44.205
Why do you have to wash all the
towels in the house at once?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.707
Just to tick you off.

01:46.807 --> 01:47.875
Here, sign this.

01:47.975 --> 01:50.043
Well, it's not look
they're dirty or anything.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.679
It's not like the
towels are dirty.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.414
When you take a shower,
you're supposed to be clean.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.516
The towels are just wet.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.651
Well, then, I'll just leave
you one towel, and you go ahead

01:57.751 --> 01:59.820
and use it over and over until
it gets hairier than you are.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.755
Wait a minute!

02:01.855 --> 02:02.756
What was that?

02:02.856 --> 02:03.991
Your report card?

02:04.091 --> 02:04.892
Damn.

02:09.763 --> 02:13.334
Four C's and a
D. Well, at least

02:13.434 --> 02:16.904
we know you're doing your best.

02:17.004 --> 02:20.107
Well, I'm just getting
to know my teachers.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.510
Oh, I liked last year's
excuse much better.

02:22.610 --> 02:23.744
Remember?

02:23.844 --> 02:28.249
I can't concentrate in class
because of the asbestos.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.317
Well, what do you want?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.485
Better grades or better excuses?

02:31.585 --> 02:32.886
No, no!

02:32.986 --> 02:35.122
With grades like that, you'll
be able to operate any Slurpee

02:35.223 --> 02:37.758
machine in this town.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.927
So what am I, grounded?

02:40.027 --> 02:40.861
No.

02:40.961 --> 02:42.430
Just go to school.
Follow Becky.

02:42.530 --> 02:43.464
She knows where it is.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.204
You let her off
mighty damn easy.

02:50.304 --> 02:51.772
What are you talking about?

02:51.872 --> 02:53.941
I'm talking about you
ought to start putting

02:54.041 --> 02:54.842
some pressure on that girl.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.176
Me?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.678
Yeah, you know, make her do
more homework or something.

02:57.778 --> 02:58.646
OK.

02:58.746 --> 02:59.680
Well, let me get
right on that, Dan,

02:59.780 --> 03:00.814
because I just don't
have enough to do.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.516
Well, how long are you
gonna let this go on?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.518
I mean, that girl doesn't
care about anything.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.954
Well, gee, Dan, let's
pretend like you're ever home.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.756
What would you do?
- Don't start.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.024
I'm killing myself
down at that shop.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.093
Oh, yeah like, uh, I don't
have a job and the restaurant

03:13.193 --> 03:14.362
and the kids.

03:14.462 --> 03:16.497
Well, at least you manage
to get eight hours sleep!

03:16.597 --> 03:17.831
Oh, eight hours!

03:17.931 --> 03:22.636
Oh, yeah, that's why I'm so
damn chipper in the morning!

03:22.736 --> 03:23.737
What is this about, Roseanne?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.506
Clothes, Darlene, what?

03:25.606 --> 03:26.607
Uh, no.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.108
Could you just take
me to the restaurant?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.142
Huh?
Could you?

03:29.243 --> 03:31.279
Could you do that
without us fighting?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.780
Yeah, I think I
can manage that!

03:32.880 --> 03:33.681
Fine!

03:42.089 --> 03:44.258
And don't use all the
toilet paper, either!

03:44.358 --> 03:46.260
That's our last roll!

03:46.360 --> 03:49.263
[theme music]

04:41.749 --> 04:43.784
How long you been here?

04:43.884 --> 04:46.354
Since hairy towels.
That was a good one.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.425
Well, Jackie, whatever
you're here for, just go ahead.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.527
Borrow it, eat it,
use it, or wash it.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.895
I don't give a damn.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.163
Jeez!

04:56.263 --> 04:57.598
What a mood!

04:57.698 --> 04:59.600
I just need a thermos of coffee.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.568
Well, there's the coffee.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.569
Knock yourself out.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.471
OK, thanks.

05:03.571 --> 05:06.139
Have you got a thermos?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.108
It's on top of
the fridge there.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.877
OK.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.980
Yep, got to stay
awake on the highway.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.048
Truckers' motto-- stay awake.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.288
So you want to talk about it?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.991
God, Jackie, don't you have
some load of innocent chickens

05:24.091 --> 05:28.028
to drop up at the nugget
factory or something?

05:28.128 --> 05:28.962
Come on!

05:29.062 --> 05:30.130
What's the deal?

05:30.230 --> 05:32.566
You guys have been fighting
all the time lately.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.934
No, that isn't true.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.537
We only fight when we see each
other, which is hardly ever.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.938
Come on.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.172
You know, I don't know.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.974
I guess it's just,
like, a combination

05:41.074 --> 05:45.112
of the fact that we are both
exhausted and he's such a jerk!

05:45.212 --> 05:47.448
[knocking]

05:50.818 --> 05:51.719
Oh, my god, it's Arnie.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.990
What's he doing here so
early in the morning?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.560
Perhaps he dropped by to
have sex with you again.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.534
I made a mistake, OK?

06:06.634 --> 06:08.569
When are you gonna
drop it already?

06:08.669 --> 06:09.470
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:09.570 --> 06:10.971
I was just crazed.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.806
Yeah, well, you
better get out of here

06:12.906 --> 06:14.842
because pretty soon, he's gonna
figure out where the door is.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.178
I got to go.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.447
I got to get on the road anyway.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.181
But just take-- you
know, take it easy.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.650
OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.717
[doorbell ringing]

06:23.817 --> 06:25.519
DAN: Hey, is anybody
gonna get the door?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.555
Yeah, anybody's on her way.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.222
Well, if you're gonna
make a big deal out of it,

06:29.322 --> 06:30.157
I'll get it!

06:30.257 --> 06:30.858
Did I make a big
deal out of it?

06:30.958 --> 06:31.959
Don't do me any favors!

06:32.059 --> 06:33.461
I was just going over
to answer this door.

06:33.561 --> 06:34.628
Hey, guys.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.096
I know it's really early,
but I brought Nancy

06:36.196 --> 06:37.965
with me so you'd let me in.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.399
Hi.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.101
Oh, so what?

06:41.201 --> 06:43.036
You guys are together
again, I see.

06:43.136 --> 06:44.672
Forever.

06:44.772 --> 06:46.206
It's official.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.108
I'm settling for Arnie.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.043
And we're getting
hitched, and we wanted you

06:50.143 --> 06:52.179
guys to be the first to know.

06:52.279 --> 06:53.881
No, you're not.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.282
You come over here
every couple of months,

06:55.382 --> 06:58.251
say you're gonna get
married, but you never do.

06:58.351 --> 06:59.587
This time, it's for real.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.421
You know, I always said I
wouldn't get married till I

07:01.522 --> 07:03.323
had a little money put away.

07:03.423 --> 07:08.696
Well, Nancy's dad gave me
$5,000 never to see her again.

07:08.796 --> 07:10.631
You are such a leech.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.332
Get off my back, you tramp!

07:12.432 --> 07:13.300
You're worthless!

07:13.400 --> 07:14.201
You're easy!

07:19.239 --> 07:20.107
I smell coffee.

07:20.207 --> 07:21.575
Come on, honey.

07:21.675 --> 07:22.876
He rules my world.

07:26.647 --> 07:31.084
That was a bad thing to see.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.053
So you're finally
gonna do it, huh?

07:33.153 --> 07:33.954
You got it.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.923
Just a small affair.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.659
Yeah, we want you guys to be,
like, best man and best woman.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.327
NANCY: I now it's short
notice, but you don't have

07:40.427 --> 07:41.862
to get a new dress or anything.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.030
It's very casual.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.131
Oh, no, It's OK.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.432
We'd love to, really.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.634
Yeah.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.035
Just name the time and
place, and we'll be there.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.002
Las Vegas, Nevada.

07:49.102 --> 07:49.903
We leave Sunday.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.605
We come back Tuesday.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.406
Vegas for three days?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.008
Jeez, I don't know.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.076
Hey, you guys love Vegas.

07:56.176 --> 07:58.078
Yeah, but we can't
afford it right now.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.412
Well, everything's on us.

07:59.513 --> 08:00.881
All you got to do is bring a
little money to gamble with.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.149
Hold on, Arnie.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.216
Come on, Dan.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.417
Just be the four of us.

08:04.518 --> 08:06.887
And if you guys don't go,
we won't have any fun.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.029
I can't just close down
the shop for two days.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.430
I'll get you tickets
to see Wayne Newton.

08:17.531 --> 08:18.398
Oh, Wayne!

08:18.498 --> 08:19.533
Oh--

08:19.633 --> 08:22.636
You know, Arn, if there
was any possible way,

08:22.736 --> 08:23.537
we'd love to do it.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.972
But we just can't.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.206
ARNIE: Aw, Dan.

08:26.306 --> 08:29.677
Arnie, he said no.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.444
Sorry for barging in.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.713
Thanks for the coffee.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.781
Please, guys?

08:33.881 --> 08:35.148
It'd be like a second
honeymoon for you.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.484
- Arnie!
- What?

08:37.585 --> 08:38.919
I don't think
you should grovel.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.087
ARNIE: Why not?
I'm good at it.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.559
You're ready to go to work?

08:48.896 --> 08:51.098
What?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.934
Well, thank you for
answering for both of us, Dan.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.002
You wanted to go?

08:55.102 --> 08:56.604
Yeah, I think it
would be a good thing.

08:56.704 --> 08:57.838
I think it would be
good for us, Dan.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.172
Well, why don't
you say something?

08:59.272 --> 09:01.609
Well, I tried.
But you were unstoppable.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.911
You want to just take
off and leave the kids?

09:04.011 --> 09:04.845
Yes, Dan!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.313
That's all I've ever wanted!

09:10.751 --> 09:12.953
Becky can take care of
everything around here.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.922
And remember, last year, I
was supposed to go to Vegas.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.625
But then you went and
screwed everything up!

09:17.725 --> 09:18.525
Oh, right!

09:18.626 --> 09:19.627
I made it snow.

09:19.727 --> 09:22.329
I closed down O'Hare
International Airport!

09:22.429 --> 09:23.396
I have that power.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.670
I want to see Wayne Newton!

09:29.770 --> 09:32.973
How am I supposed to close
down the shop for two days?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.107
Well, because,
you're the boss.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.744
And if you don't show
up, it's just closed.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.378
You know what your
problem is, Dan?

09:38.478 --> 09:40.247
You just never want
to go anywhere!

09:40.347 --> 09:43.516
Hey, I could use a vacation
as much as anybody else!

09:43.617 --> 09:44.785
- So what's stopping you?
- Nothing!

09:44.885 --> 09:45.919
Well, good!

09:46.019 --> 09:47.187
Then you call Arnie and
tell him we're going!

09:47.287 --> 09:48.088
Fine!

09:48.188 --> 09:49.022
Fine!

09:49.122 --> 09:50.858
- Second honeymoon!
- You're on!

09:57.530 --> 10:00.801

10:00.901 --> 10:03.536
DAN: (SINGING) Luck
be a lady tonight.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.974
Luck, be a lady tonight.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.375
Stick with me, baby.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.243
I'm the fella you came in with.

10:10.343 --> 10:11.912
Luck, be a lady tonight.

10:15.015 --> 10:18.218
ROSEANNE: (SINGING)
Luck, be a lady tonight.

10:18.318 --> 10:21.655
Luck, be a lady tonight.

10:21.755 --> 10:25.092
Luck, if you've ever been
a lady to begin with,

10:25.192 --> 10:28.095
luck, be a lady tonight.

10:28.195 --> 10:31.598
DAN: (SINGING) Luck be a lady.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.768
ROSEANNE AND DAN: (SINGING)
Luck, be a lady tonight!

10:42.710 --> 10:43.576
Yes!

10:43.677 --> 10:44.577
All right!

10:44.678 --> 10:46.079
Yes!

10:46.179 --> 10:47.647
Boy, you're doing good.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.949
Yeah, can't seem to lose.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.218
Great.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.887
Boy is this machine hot!

10:53.987 --> 10:56.156
Yes!

10:56.256 --> 10:59.659
Roseanne Conner from
Lanford, Illinois.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.329
Alice Thurber, Atomo, Iowa.

11:02.429 --> 11:03.663
Well, nice to meet you.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.135
- Yes!
- Oh, man!

11:08.235 --> 11:09.069
You won again!

11:09.169 --> 11:10.503
That's great!

11:10.603 --> 11:11.471
Yeah.

11:11.571 --> 11:12.806
I got a system.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.308
I walk up and down the aisles
until a machine sends off,

11:15.408 --> 11:16.409
you know, vibes.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.012
Well, this one was humming!

11:21.949 --> 11:22.750
Yes!

11:22.850 --> 11:24.184
DAN: There she is.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.618
Oh, baby!

11:25.719 --> 11:27.554
Oh, great!

11:27.654 --> 11:30.758
Hey, uh, Dan, Alice Thurber.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.993
Alice Thurber, my husband, Dan.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.394
Good to meet you, Alice.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.628
Same here.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.465
Yeah, Alice Thurber
is having a great night

11:38.565 --> 11:39.833
on these machines, Dan.

11:39.933 --> 11:40.968
Alice Thurber is?

11:41.068 --> 11:43.370
Alice Thurber is.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.605
Here you go for
gambling money.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.876
Me and Arnie are
gonna go shoot craps.

11:48.976 --> 11:50.377
Kiss for luck.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.579
Hey, Nance, can I get a
little more money from you?

11:52.679 --> 11:54.948
What'd you do with the
money I already gave you?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.050
I bought a hamburger.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.087
Here's another 20,
but make it last.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.356
Where's my kiss?

12:06.126 --> 12:07.928
Bye, sweetie.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.496
Hey, Dan, can I
get 20 from you?

12:09.596 --> 12:12.632
OK, but not on the lips.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.736
You know, I just want to thank
you for coming up here with us.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.538
It means so much
to Arnie and me.

12:18.638 --> 12:21.474
Oh, it just came at
the perfect time, Nancy.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.944
Me and Dan really
needed to get away.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.612
I should be thanking you.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.447
God, you guys have been
married, like, forever,

12:27.547 --> 12:28.348
haven't you?

12:28.448 --> 12:30.283
Last May.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.920
Any advice for the newlyweds?

12:33.020 --> 12:35.388
Well, since you
and Arnie are paying

12:35.488 --> 12:38.959
for the trip and the show and
the food and everything, no.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.498
Hey, I never did ask
you, how-- how did,

12:45.598 --> 12:47.567
uh, you and Arnie meet?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.502
Remember when he used to
work for the water department?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.570
Yeah.

12:50.670 --> 12:52.272
Well, he was reading
my meter one day.

12:52.372 --> 12:56.509
And I caught him peeping
through the blinds at me.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.378
Oh, he still does that?

12:58.478 --> 13:01.381
It was so perverted.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.617
So we started dating.

13:04.717 --> 13:05.819
One thing led to another.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.823
Next thing I know,
he's living in my car.

13:09.923 --> 13:12.159
MAN (ON INTERCOM):
Paging Alice Thurber.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.393
Doggone it.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.794
MAN (ON INTERCOM): Telephone
call for Alice Thurber.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.699
Me and Dan have a system, too.

13:27.107 --> 13:27.908
Whoa!

13:30.944 --> 13:33.813
[music playing]

13:34.915 --> 13:37.417
[phone ringing]

13:37.517 --> 13:38.751
Hello?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.553
Oh, hi, Mom.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.889
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.491
You want to talk to Becky?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.559
Well, she's in your bed
right now with Mark.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.594
Should I wake them?

13:47.694 --> 13:49.062
Give me the phone!

13:52.099 --> 13:55.135
DJ, go take a bath.

13:55.235 --> 13:56.636
I got to do a science project.

13:56.736 --> 13:57.537
So do it.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.239
Mom always helps me.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.610
Mom's in Las Vegas, DJ,
and she's never coming back.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.178
I got to make a sundial.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.380
Well, then, make a sundial.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.848
I don't know how.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.784
Just find something round.

14:11.885 --> 14:12.685
There.

14:20.393 --> 14:21.561
Now take it outside.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.096
And when it starts to
stink, it's tomorrow.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.238
Deej, you want to talk to Mom?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.173
No!

14:33.273 --> 14:35.208
No.

14:35.308 --> 14:39.379
Well, Mom you already
called twice today.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.280
No.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.181
No, Mom.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.283
We do too miss you.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.086
Well, we would if
you'd leave us alone.

14:46.186 --> 14:49.056
[music playing]

15:05.005 --> 15:06.739
Boo!
Call the kids?

15:06.839 --> 15:07.640
Oh, yeah.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.209
They're still there.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.744
How the hell do you
think this thing works?

15:11.844 --> 15:12.745
Well, you put a quarter in.

15:12.845 --> 15:13.947
It drops in.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.915
And if it pushes the other
quarters off the edge,

15:16.016 --> 15:16.950
you get to keep 'em.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.351
Man, look at that.

15:18.451 --> 15:22.555
There's like 100 quarters just
waiting to jump off the cliff!

15:22.655 --> 15:23.923
Man!

15:24.024 --> 15:25.225
Oh.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.528
Yeah, they got this sucker
nailed down pretty good.

15:28.628 --> 15:30.597
OK, we'll do it your way.

15:30.697 --> 15:31.965
Give me a quarter, Dan.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.300
This'll be easy money.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.301
Oh, well, golly.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.702
If it looks easy, I bet it is!

15:35.802 --> 15:38.905
Here, let me fish out a quarter,
and you go get us a big bucket

15:39.006 --> 15:41.641
to catch our winnings!

15:41.741 --> 15:43.810
Just give me the quarter.

15:43.910 --> 15:47.214
You know, the guy that invented
this game must be a moron.

15:47.314 --> 15:48.215
Give me another one.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.885
Give me another one.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.425
Give ma another one.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.792
Oh, here it comes!
Here it comes!

15:59.892 --> 16:01.728
Here it comes!
Give me another one.

Yahoo!

16:06.466 --> 16:07.934
Look at that, I won!

16:08.035 --> 16:08.835
A quarter!

16:08.935 --> 16:10.070
Look at that!

16:10.170 --> 16:12.372
Now don't go
giving all that back.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.441
Walk away a winner.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.542
So what do you want to do?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.844
Craps, blackjack?

16:17.944 --> 16:19.112
No.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.114
Guess again.

16:21.214 --> 16:22.549
Liberace Museum.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.917
Say something sexy, Dan.

16:25.018 --> 16:25.885
We're up 85 bucks.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.221
Ooh, let's go to the room.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.589
Could this be happening?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.324
No kids, no work.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.292
Just you and me?

16:32.392 --> 16:33.193
ARNIE: Dan!

16:33.293 --> 16:34.927
Rosie!

16:35.028 --> 16:36.896
And Nancy and sluggo.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.666
Hey, check it out!

16:39.766 --> 16:44.104
We've converted our craps
winnings into actual crap.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.005
Oh, man, you won, too?

16:46.106 --> 16:47.940
How does this place
stay in business?

16:48.041 --> 16:49.309
Isn't this the worst?

16:49.409 --> 16:50.477
God, I hope so.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.678
Hey, listen.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.713
You're my best man, so we
got to go rent me a tux.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.715
Can't you do that
by yourself, Arnie?

16:55.815 --> 16:56.783
Come on, Dan.

16:56.883 --> 17:00.287
You know I can't do
anything by myself.

17:00.387 --> 17:02.422
Oh, go on, Dan.

17:02.522 --> 17:03.323
Later?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.125
- Later.
- Yeah.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.726
And later, we're taking
you guys out to dinner.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.228
And I won't take hell
no for an answer.

17:08.328 --> 17:10.230
Let's go, Dan

17:10.330 --> 17:11.964
Honey, remember,
I'm wearing white.

17:12.065 --> 17:14.767
You should wear white, too.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.804
We're going as virgins.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.773
[music playing]

17:28.315 --> 17:29.549
Rosie, tell me the truth.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.717
You saw that woman in there.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.719
My boob job's better
than her boob job.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.454
You can't compare.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.055
It's apples and oranges.

17:36.156 --> 17:39.226
You know, when I first
decided to do this, Arnie

17:39.326 --> 17:40.927
and I got into a huge fight.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.662
I wanted to look like
Jamie Lee Curtis,

17:42.762 --> 17:44.564
and he wanted the
Adrienne Barbeau.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.267
But I didn't have enough skin.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.535
OK, look.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.437
We've down the buffet thing.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.738
We've done the gambling thing.

17:51.838 --> 17:52.839
We've done the shopping thing.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.274
What do you want to do tonight?

17:54.374 --> 17:56.476
Well, if you don't
mind, I'd just like to get

17:56.576 --> 17:58.578
Dan and do the alone thing.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.014
Oh, isn't that sweet,
after all these years?

18:02.115 --> 18:03.983
Yeah, I think
we're ready again.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.921
DAN: Give me.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.291
MAN: Come on.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.192
Seven.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.327
Yeah!

18:14.427 --> 18:17.330
Man, that third desert's
almost always a mistake, Dan.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.466
Yeah, but you definitely
got 'em rethinking the whole

18:19.566 --> 18:22.335
all-you-can-eat concept.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.772
All right.

18:25.872 --> 18:26.773
MAN: Seven!

18:26.873 --> 18:27.774
Winner, winner!

18:27.874 --> 18:28.908
Damn!

18:29.008 --> 18:30.843
You know, Arnie, you
keep betting against me,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.245
and it's really ticking me off.

18:32.345 --> 18:33.713
Hey, there's no rule
against that, Dan.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.081
I'm allowed to bet
any way I want to bet.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.549
Yeah, but it's
like a code, man.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.185
You don't bet
against your friends.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.719
You play your
way, I play mine.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.521
Now roll the dice.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.489
11!

18:42.589 --> 18:43.856
Yes!

18:43.956 --> 18:45.225
Hell!

18:45.325 --> 18:47.227
- You gonna bet on me now, man?
- No way, man.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.428
You're bound to lose sometime.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.963
Hey, can I borrow another 20?

18:51.063 --> 18:52.432
Miss me, sugar top?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.367
Did you notice I
was gone, bubble butt?

18:54.467 --> 18:56.135
Here, blow on the dice, baby.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.738
Let's shake the joint up.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.639
Are you winning?

18:59.739 --> 19:00.540
Winning?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.242
Yes.
Big winning.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.176
Big, big winning.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.645
Yay, Dan!

19:05.745 --> 19:07.113
11!

19:07.214 --> 19:08.114
Happy dance!

19:11.184 --> 19:12.519
Man, you guys
are making me sick.

19:12.619 --> 19:13.520
Let's get out of here.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.987
Let's all go to a
show or something.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.956
Arnie, it's just you
and me tonight, honey.

19:17.056 --> 19:18.925
They want to be alone.
- For what?

19:21.961 --> 19:23.330
Oh, I get it.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.365
You guys want to go out and
get us some wedding gifts, huh?

19:25.465 --> 19:26.433
Well, have a good time, Dan.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.334
Let's go, honey.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.506
Four, four.
The point's four.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.507
Dan.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.443
OK, just give me
one second, honey.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.944
One second.

19:38.044 --> 19:40.413
OK.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.314
Oh!

19:41.414 --> 19:42.282
Winner!

19:42.382 --> 19:43.316
Incredible!

19:43.416 --> 19:44.217
Dan.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.117
What?

19:45.218 --> 19:46.118
What, what, what?

19:46.219 --> 19:47.086
We had a date.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.054
Now?

19:48.154 --> 19:50.690
- Yeah, now.
- Rosie, I'm hot.

19:50.790 --> 19:55.628
- Well, so am I.
- Rosie, come on.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.630
I'm having a real
good time here.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.731
Oh, what?

19:58.831 --> 20:00.467
Like you wouldn't have
a good time with me

20:00.567 --> 20:01.634
alone up in the room?

20:01.734 --> 20:04.571
[crowd gasping]

20:04.671 --> 20:07.607
[music playing]

20:08.808 --> 20:10.243
Well, if you want to
go back to the casino,

20:10.343 --> 20:11.778
go back to the casino.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.546
Let's just do what
we came up here to do.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.686
Oh, you sweet talker, you.

20:19.786 --> 20:20.720
DAN: Look at this.

20:20.820 --> 20:23.189
You got your stuff
all over the place.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.457
Where am I supposed
to put my stuff?

20:24.557 --> 20:25.358
On the floor?

20:25.458 --> 20:28.261
Yeah, pretend
like you're home.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.396
DAN: Honey!

20:29.496 --> 20:30.963
There's something wrong
with the towel racks!

20:31.063 --> 20:34.767
Look, they got fresh, clean
towels hanging all over 'em!

20:34.867 --> 20:35.935
You know, we
could have this very

20:36.035 --> 20:38.338
same argument back in Lanford.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.806
You're the one that
dragged us out here.

20:39.906 --> 20:42.875
And just when I started having
fun, you drag me away from it.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.844
Hey, we had a date!

20:44.944 --> 20:47.314
And excuse me, but I
thought I was more important

20:47.414 --> 20:48.715
than that stupid game.
- You are.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.583
But it wouldn't have killed
you to wait a half an hour.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.952
We came here so we could
spend time together, Dan!

20:53.052 --> 20:55.588
We haven't had five minutes
alone since we got here!

20:55.688 --> 20:58.157
Well, now we're alone.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.926
I, for one, am
having a great time.

21:05.732 --> 21:08.501
You know, Dan, we should
have took separate vacations.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.104
I go to Vegas, and
you go to hell.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.442
