<i>Our town's boardwalk.</i>

01:34.194 --> 01:40.531
<i>Our last summer party:</i>
<i>The election of Miss Mermaid 1953.</i>

01:41.668 --> 01:43.135
<i>Nice crowd, no?</i>

01:43.336 --> 01:49.366
<i>Visitors, tourists,</i>
<i>and a Roman actress as judge.</i>

01:50.410 --> 01:51.809
<i>Everybody's here.</i>

01:53.313 --> 01:57.613
<i>And, of course, we're here too...</i>
<i>the guys...</i>

01:59.119 --> 02:00.484
<i>This is Alberto.</i>

02:05.992 --> 02:08.152
<i>This is Leopoldo, the intellectual.</i>

02:12.232 --> 02:15.360
<i>And here's Moraldo,</i>
<i>the youngest in our crowd.</i>

02:18.271 --> 02:20.330
Look at the lightning.
It's beautiful.

02:20.473 --> 02:24.534
<i>The tenor's Riccardo. As always,</i>
<i>this is pretty much his night.</i>

02:25.345 --> 02:30.009
<i>And here's Fausto,</i>
<i>our leader and spiritual guide.</i>

02:31.751 --> 02:33.184
Do you believe me now?

02:34.420 --> 02:38.720
Do you think I'm that stupid?
Give me my shoe.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.554
I will, but give me a kiss.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.025
- Let go.
- Give me a kiss.

02:44.230 --> 02:46.027
I said let go.

02:46.232 --> 02:50.032
- Don't be so coy.
- Let me go, you jerk!

02:50.837 --> 02:51.861
The nerve!

02:52.071 --> 02:54.596
Listen, you goose,
you promised me...

02:54.941 --> 02:59.139
- Promised you what?
- That before you left...

02:59.546 --> 03:02.310
You're so gullible.
People promise a lot of things.

03:02.515 --> 03:06.246
Think what you promised Sandra.
- Sandra who? You're hallucinating.

03:06.452 --> 03:09.114
So now you don't even know her?
That's rich.

03:09.322 --> 03:13.691
With four of five votes,
Miss Mermaid 1953 is

03:13.893 --> 03:15.292
Miss Sandra Rubini.

03:15.495 --> 03:21.229
My little girl! Just think,
you didn't even want to enter.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.029
Your little sister won!

03:25.538 --> 03:27.062
Go, dear, go.

03:30.843 --> 03:34.006
Miss Mermaid 1953!

03:37.283 --> 03:38.477
She's really excited.

03:38.685 --> 03:43.486
Ladies and gentlemen,
here from Rome is film star Lilia Landi.

03:43.690 --> 03:49.185
She will now place the sash
of Miss Mermaid 1953

03:49.295 --> 03:51.729
on our very own beauty queen.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.894
Party's over.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.892
A few words for the fans.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.299
- I...
- Wonderful! She said "I"!

04:04.744 --> 04:06.712
Look! It's lightning!

04:07.013 --> 04:09.777
- I didn't want to compete...
- It's just a passing shower.

04:09.983 --> 04:13.419
The party'll continue.
It's just a little...

04:17.457 --> 04:18.788
The check, Mr. Alberto.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.187
- Everyone's leaving.
- At least pay your share.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.834
- Introduce me to Lilia Landi.
- Not right now!

04:33.973 --> 04:36.100
There she is. Please.

04:40.079 --> 04:44.812
Miss Landi, meet one of
our most esteemed citizens,

04:45.018 --> 04:47.213
playwright Leopoldo Vannucci.
- Delighted.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.354
Most honored.
I've followed your career closely.

04:49.555 --> 04:52.490
He's also our resident poet.

04:55.094 --> 04:58.962
It's beautiful outside,
like the end of the world.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.609
Congratulations, Sandra,
Mrs. Rubini.

05:17.216 --> 05:18.945
Now you'll be in the movies.

05:27.093 --> 05:30.551
I want you to meet my little girl.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.990
My God! Moraldo!

05:36.202 --> 05:39.535
- What's wrong, Mama?
- Come here! Your sister's sick!

05:40.873 --> 05:45.003
- Excuse me, please.
- Get a doctor, quickly!

05:46.512 --> 05:51.074
Mama, calm down. It's nothing.
Is there a doctor around?

05:51.884 --> 05:53.351
Yeah... Mancinelli!

05:54.120 --> 05:56.918
Here I am. What's happened?
Step aside! Let me by!

05:57.123 --> 05:59.284
Doctor, my little girl...

05:59.492 --> 06:02.723
Here I am. What's happened?

06:05.365 --> 06:08.266
Get out of the way!
Let me through!

06:08.468 --> 06:10.368
It's nothing!
She just needs some air.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.742
- Look at poor Sandra!
- It's nothing, Mama. Calm down.

06:22.348 --> 06:25.749
- Fausto! Leopoldo, call Fausto!
- Fausto!

06:25.852 --> 06:26.978
Come here!

06:32.558 --> 06:36.619
- Calm down, Mama. It's nothing,
- Nothing? Look at her!

06:37.296 --> 06:39.764
Let me through.

06:43.503 --> 06:46.768
- What happened?
- Sandra fainted.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.675
Is she better?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.177
- Mama.
- Darling!

06:54.013 --> 06:55.446
What's wrong?

06:57.850 --> 07:00.182
I want to die!

07:00.386 --> 07:05.187
What? You want to die,
now that you're Miss Mermaid?

07:05.391 --> 07:09.384
Don't say that, even as a joke!
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

07:13.032 --> 07:14.158
Answer me.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.858
All right, everyone out!

07:59.412 --> 08:01.607
Back already?

08:01.714 --> 08:03.147
That's why it's raining.

08:03.549 --> 08:05.141
What are you up to?

08:05.718 --> 08:09.313
Papa, I gotta leave now,
on business.

08:09.522 --> 08:13.458
Remember that job offer
from Milan?

08:13.659 --> 08:16.457
Well, I've thought about it,
and I'm going to take it.

08:17.630 --> 08:18.790
At this hour?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.989
What have you done now?

08:21.200 --> 08:23.828
Nothing. I'm taking a job.
Aren't you satisfied?

08:24.036 --> 08:25.503
What sort of job?

08:25.705 --> 08:29.266
With a company.
They're reliable people.

08:29.408 --> 08:32.342
By the way, can you lend me
5,000 lire for the train?

08:32.445 --> 08:34.572
I'll pay you back
when I get there.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.873
You punk. What did you do?

08:38.150 --> 08:39.549
What did you do?

08:39.751 --> 08:41.652
Nothing. I just got a job.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.751
Don't you believe me?
I'm catching the 1:00 train.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.660
I'll see who it is.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.137
Hello, Mr. Francesco.
How are you?

09:00.640 --> 09:02.699
Hi, Moraldo. Come in.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.134
Come on in.

09:08.214 --> 09:08.908
Sit down.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.475
Excuse us, Papa. Okay?

09:17.256 --> 09:20.089
Some downpour, no?
Summer's over - too bad.

09:20.293 --> 09:21.453
Cigarette?

09:21.661 --> 09:24.653
- You only have one left.
- Never mind. I don't want it.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.894
It'll rain for days.

09:29.201 --> 09:30.532
Depressing, huh?

09:36.075 --> 09:38.339
- So you're going?
- Yeah, I'm splitting.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.813
- Will you be gone long?
- I don't know... depends.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.614
And Sandra?

09:44.817 --> 09:48.548
She's Miss Mermaid now.
She must be happy.

09:50.623 --> 09:52.454
Sandra's expecting.

09:53.693 --> 09:55.126
Yeah, I know.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.058
That's why I'm splitting.

09:59.098 --> 10:01.828
I'd like to do the right thing,
but how can I?

10:02.034 --> 10:05.492
I'm broke, like you.
That's why I'm going to Milan.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.764
I wanna do something with my life.

10:08.374 --> 10:12.470
Just till I get on my feet.
Don't you believe me?

10:14.046 --> 10:15.274
I didn't say a word.

10:15.781 --> 10:20.218
Look, we understand each other.
I really love Sandra.

10:21.187 --> 10:25.624
I'll swear by whatever you want,
by my own mother. I really love her.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.391
It was fate.

10:29.395 --> 10:34.492
Be honest. In my shoes, wouldn't you
first try to make it on your own?

10:36.702 --> 10:39.830
- I don't know.
- You're hopeless.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.277
Why not go with me?

10:46.512 --> 10:49.640
We'll go together.
This town's dead in winter.

10:50.516 --> 10:55.283
If not Milan, we'll go somewhere else.
We've always wanted to leave.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.616
- Right now?
- This is our big chance!

10:59.025 --> 11:01.516
And Sandra will be thrilled,
you'll see.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.627
Let's go and talk outside.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.224
Be quiet. Don't make any noise.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.729
- But I...
- Come on!

11:09.201 --> 11:11.032
Turn off the light.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.169
Papa! Excuse me, Moraldo.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.634
Can I have that 5,000 lire?

11:17.610 --> 11:19.271
What do you want it for?

11:19.945 --> 11:22.311
To run out?
- No, Papa.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.712
You get in trouble and you run.
I'll wring your neck.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.987
- Papa, please...
- Shut up! Come here!

11:29.321 --> 11:31.050
What are you gonna do, Papa?

11:32.725 --> 11:35.319
I swear I'll...
Get out of my way!

11:35.761 --> 11:36.853
You little weasel!

11:37.063 --> 11:41.124
I swear by your poor mother
that your foul escapades are over!

11:41.333 --> 11:43.665
That girl's father is a decent guy.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.431
Worked all his life, like me,

11:46.639 --> 11:50.803
idiot that I am,
to support his family honestly.

11:51.343 --> 11:55.803
You'll marry her, if I have to kick
your ass all the way to the church.

11:56.015 --> 11:57.277
You bastard!

11:58.951 --> 12:01.010
What's going on, Papa?

12:02.955 --> 12:04.081
Nothing.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.188
Go back to bed.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.596
You will marry her.
I'll make sure of that.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.542
Hey, Fausto.

12:41.527 --> 12:43.791
Go ahead, laugh, idiots.
My father's crying.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.768
<i>So they got married.</i>

12:56.976 --> 13:00.002
<i>It was a lovely wedding,</i>
<i>even if a bit hastily arranged.</i>

13:05.785 --> 13:10.154
<i>Riccardo sang</i> Ave Maria
<i>and made us all cry.</i>

13:25.671 --> 13:28.469
<i>And the parish priest,</i>
<i>who'd known us forever,</i>

13:28.808 --> 13:30.799
<i>gave a very moving speech.</i>

13:31.010 --> 13:32.807
My children...

13:33.179 --> 13:35.807
you can't imagine
what a joy it is for me

13:36.015 --> 13:38.575
to join you in holy matrimony.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.310
You, dear Fausto...

13:41.520 --> 13:43.283
and you, dear Sandra.

13:47.793 --> 13:51.524
See? Quick and painless.
Good for you.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.205
See, Papa?
I'm a married man now.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.245
My little girl.

14:26.165 --> 14:28.156
Hold it. Stand together.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.892
Alberto, you're standing
in front of the bride.

14:35.407 --> 14:37.637
Don't quarrel!

14:37.843 --> 14:40.971
Be careful crossing
the streets in Rome!

15:05.471 --> 15:07.268
What are you crying for?

15:15.614 --> 15:17.411
- Riccardo.
- I'm coming.

15:36.468 --> 15:39.062
- Where to now?
- Let's go to Marina.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.869
Good-bye, Francesco.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.566
Thanks, Mr. Rubini.

15:45.844 --> 15:49.280
You'll see.
Fausto's not really a bad kid.

15:49.581 --> 15:50.206
I know.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.850
This must be your little girl.
Your youngest?

15:53.052 --> 15:54.610
Yes, she's an angel.

15:54.820 --> 15:56.185
Of course,

15:56.355 --> 15:58.346
Fausto will live with us

15:58.457 --> 16:02.416
until he can support himself
and his wife.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.055
Good day.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.090
Why does she treat him like that?

16:09.168 --> 16:10.260
Take us home.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.234
Can we buy you a drink,
Mr. Francesco?

16:19.878 --> 16:22.870
No, thank you, Riccardo.
I'm going home.

16:30.189 --> 16:31.679
- Nine and two... that's 11.
- 11 to 20.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.551
You think you won?

16:34.159 --> 16:37.390
Leopoldo, mark two points
for me, please.

16:39.064 --> 16:40.588
Leopoldo, why the long face?

16:41.000 --> 16:42.092
I'm depressed.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.761
What's the big deal?
Just 'cause those two left...

16:45.404 --> 16:47.770
- I wonder if they're in Rome yet.
- What a drag!

16:47.973 --> 16:51.773
You gotta know your way
around Rome to have any real fun.

16:52.044 --> 16:55.343
If he'd gone with me,
it'd be a different story.

16:55.547 --> 16:58.277
A couple of phone calls
and we could have had a ball.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.042
And what about Sandra?

17:01.787 --> 17:03.584
I meant if we were single.

17:03.789 --> 17:09.250
If I went on a honeymoon,
I'd go to Africa, like Hemingway.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.396
Free, in the wild, in a Jeep.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.859
Sounds fabulous.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.397
Africa would be a real escape.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.627
I'd go there with Esther Williams.
- What about Franca Marzi?

17:20.239 --> 17:22.069
Franca Marzi, Ginger Rogers.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.866
Oh, I know!

17:24.076 --> 17:27.204
Remember the surveyor's girlfriend?
The one who burned her shoulder.

17:27.413 --> 17:31.042
- The Ciuffini girl.
- Yeah, Africa with her!

17:31.250 --> 17:33.013
I'd prefer India.

17:33.385 --> 17:34.409
Antonio.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.216
Come on, I called you.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.821
You're always in the way.
What do you want?

17:48.467 --> 17:51.868
You can talk all you like,
but he's in Rome and we're stuck

17:52.071 --> 17:54.539
in this dirty little rat hole.

17:57.643 --> 18:00.203
They make a nice couple, though.

18:00.345 --> 18:01.710
Nice couple?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.382
She's a pretty girl,

18:04.483 --> 18:06.451
but not Fausto, with that face!

18:06.652 --> 18:08.813
He's tall and well built.

18:09.054 --> 18:11.488
- And he has a decent voice.
- Big deal.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.482
We all have voices.

18:19.264 --> 18:22.495
Didn't you have any inkling
about Fausto and your sister?

18:22.701 --> 18:26.831
To be straight about it,
Fausto was a real cad.

18:27.039 --> 18:31.066
He's a scoundrel.
- I wouldn't go that far.

18:31.276 --> 18:35.975
He's a passionate creature,
driven by animal instincts.

18:36.181 --> 18:39.947
What are you talking about?
You think you're writing a play?

18:40.152 --> 18:43.713
Fausto's just a horny...
It's as if one of you went with my sister.

18:43.922 --> 18:45.719
Now there's an idea!

18:59.771 --> 19:01.762
Alberto, leave her alone.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.277
Bastards, you oughta be in bed!

19:30.569 --> 19:32.833
<i>What's left for us to do?</i>

19:33.038 --> 19:37.907
<i>Another day has come to an end.</i>
<i>Nothing to do but go home, as usual.</i>

19:39.378 --> 19:41.369
<i>Alberto lives</i>
<i>with his mama and sister,</i>

19:41.580 --> 19:44.743
<i>and he knows that</i>
<i>Mama waits up until he gets in.</i>

19:44.950 --> 19:46.315
Alberto's home.

20:05.270 --> 20:08.967
<i>Riccardo, as usual,</i>
<i>stares at his growing gut.</i>

20:16.748 --> 20:19.080
<i>Helluva time to walk in,</i>
<i>you little punk!</i>

20:19.284 --> 20:21.650
'Night, Papa. 'Night, Mama.

20:22.321 --> 20:26.314
<i>After eating the meal</i>
<i>his aunts have left for him,</i>

20:26.525 --> 20:29.187
<i>Leopoldo prepares to work</i>
<i>on his new play.</i>

20:29.895 --> 20:32.227
<i>He puts on his favorite</i>
<i>record,</i> Fly the Night

20:33.065 --> 20:35.124
<i>and sits at his table.</i>

20:38.136 --> 20:41.936
<i>Removing the cap of his pen,</i>
<i>he draws a triangle</i>

20:43.242 --> 20:45.676
<i>and watches his characters</i>
<i>parade across the ceiling.</i>

21:08.700 --> 21:09.530
Caterina.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.034
<i>She's the neighbors'maid.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:14.167
Hi, Caterina. How's it going?

21:14.373 --> 21:16.238
Not so good.
It's too cold out.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.643
How are you doing?
- Okay. I'm working.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.073
Really?

21:24.082 --> 21:25.982
What a lovely moon!

21:26.918 --> 21:29.386
- As lovely as you.
- Liar!

21:29.788 --> 21:32.222
Why do you always play that song?

21:32.591 --> 21:33.751
It inspires me.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.799
<i>Just like every other night,</i>
<i>only Moraldo walks the empty streets.</i>

22:06.625 --> 22:08.559
What if I left too?

22:19.171 --> 22:20.297
Where are you off to?

22:21.106 --> 22:24.007
It's 3:00 a.m.
Aren't you gonna sleep?

22:24.710 --> 22:27.873
Sleep? I just got up.
I always get up at 3:00.

22:28.113 --> 22:29.341
- Why?
- I go to work.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.280
Work?

22:32.617 --> 22:33.914
At the station.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.021
Sit down a minute.
What do you do?

22:41.626 --> 22:42.923
What kinda work?

22:43.128 --> 22:44.720
I just told you: I work.

22:50.001 --> 22:52.299
- Is this a railroad cap?
- Yeah.

23:00.345 --> 23:02.108
Tell me, are you happy?

23:03.181 --> 23:04.409
It's okay.

23:07.285 --> 23:08.445
- Want a smoke?
- Sure.

23:12.424 --> 23:13.789
I had one here...

23:16.995 --> 23:19.463
Sorry, I'm out.
- Never mind. I gotta go.

23:19.564 --> 23:20.394
Listen...

23:43.422 --> 23:46.186
- How's the helmet?
- Okay, it fits fine.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.118
- Will it fly?
- Sooner than my enemies think.

23:50.328 --> 23:54.662
So it does fly! Invite me,
and I'll bring a spoon to celebrate.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.231
Olga.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.694
Come out here for a moment.

24:09.581 --> 24:13.108
Do me a favor. I'll pay you back
on Sunday. I'm closing a deal.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.746
Lend me 1,000 lire.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.513
- So you'll pay me back?
- Yeah.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.322
You worked all night?

24:20.525 --> 24:24.621
They should give you a raise.
I'll have a word with the boss.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.760
- I only have 500.
- That's okay.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.426
Thanks, Olga. See you.

24:32.571 --> 24:35.131
Massimo and Leopoldo are off
to Bologna for the trotters.

24:35.340 --> 24:37.774
I've got an inside tip.
Let's get a bet down.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.342
A thousand would cover it.
I've got 300 - how about you?

24:43.782 --> 24:46.751
<i>Now, even on Sundays,</i>
<i>the beach is deserted,</i>

24:47.018 --> 24:49.543
<i>Still, we'd stare out to sea.</i>

24:54.626 --> 24:57.959
If you were offered 10,000 lire,
would you go in?

24:59.965 --> 25:00.932
I would.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.131
Let's go.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.031
Let's go and watch Giudizio fish.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.434
Come on, Riccardo.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.740
You know who Leopoldo looks like?
The priest!

26:16.875 --> 26:19.605
Please don't tell Mama you saw me.

26:21.713 --> 26:23.180
You said it was over with him.

26:26.351 --> 26:27.375
Listen.

26:27.586 --> 26:28.575
Let me go!

26:30.121 --> 26:32.316
Quit staring, guys.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.498
Come on,
let's go watch Giudizio fish.

27:07.225 --> 27:08.283
Hi, Alberto.

27:08.493 --> 27:11.257
- Look...
- We keep bumping into each other.

27:11.463 --> 27:13.522
You're making me look like a jerk
in front of my friends.

27:13.732 --> 27:16.963
Your friends mocking other people?
That's rich.

27:17.168 --> 27:19.432
Ya gotta break up with that jerk!

27:19.638 --> 27:21.435
What can you expect from him?

27:22.307 --> 27:23.365
Nothing.

27:25.877 --> 27:28.675
I don't expect anything.
- He's got a wife!

27:28.880 --> 27:31.678
- Stop yelling! Mama's sleeping.
- He's married!

27:31.883 --> 27:34.374
I know, but they're separated.

27:34.586 --> 27:36.713
So what?
Is he gonna marry you?

27:36.921 --> 27:39.685
Is he gonna marry you?
- Butt out, Alberto!

27:43.395 --> 27:46.387
I can take care of myself.
I know what I should do.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.725
- You work so you can do as you please?
- Yes.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.592
No, you can't!

27:51.703 --> 27:53.261
You're my sister!

27:53.471 --> 27:55.063
Get your hands off me!

27:55.507 --> 27:57.372
If you make Mama cry...

27:57.575 --> 27:59.338
Get outta here, Alberto!

28:02.881 --> 28:04.746
If you make Mama cry, I'll...

28:14.993 --> 28:18.156
<i>Then, one day, when we'd just about</i>
<i>forgotten about him...</i>

28:18.363 --> 28:20.024
Hey, guys!

28:20.231 --> 28:20.993
It's Massimo.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.929
- Guys! Fausto's back in town.
- He's really back?

28:24.135 --> 28:27.263
- Yeah, and he's got a mustache!
- Where is he?

28:27.806 --> 28:29.137
There he is!

28:30.008 --> 28:32.636
- Hey, boys!
- Fausto, how's it going?

28:34.179 --> 28:36.704
- How are you?
- Just great, thanks.

28:39.551 --> 28:42.850
Hi, Alberto! We've been looking
for you for an hour.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.488
Come over here, guys.
I've got something amazing to show you.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.887
- What's that?
- It's a gramophone.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.461
We saw Wanda Osiris.
- She was wonderful.

28:53.665 --> 28:57.658
Sure, it was a nice show,
but let's not go overboard.

28:58.036 --> 29:00.402
She came down this long staircase...

29:02.273 --> 29:05.333
Quiet, quiet.
Just listen to this mambo.

29:05.543 --> 29:09.001
There was a guy who danced like this.

29:23.294 --> 29:26.161
- Teach me. Is it hard?
- Just follow me.

29:38.676 --> 29:40.610
- Nice, isn't it?
- Are you happy?

29:40.812 --> 29:42.837
Yes, very happy.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.248
<i>Things would've gone on as usual</i>

29:53.458 --> 29:56.894
<i>if Fausto's father-in-law</i>
<i>hadn't come up with a crazy idea.</i>

30:01.833 --> 30:03.858
- Praise our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Forever and ever.

30:05.670 --> 30:09.333
My good friend,
you get younger by the day.

30:11.042 --> 30:12.441
How are you?

30:12.777 --> 30:14.745
This must be your son-in-law.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.244
Pleased to meet you.

30:16.447 --> 30:19.314
Belated congratulations!

30:20.185 --> 30:22.745
You're a lucky man.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.148
Very lucky.

30:25.089 --> 30:27.751
What's your name?
- Fausto Moretti.

30:28.793 --> 30:32.160
Let me be absolutely candid.

30:32.831 --> 30:37.063
This here is my establishment.
Somewhat small, perhaps...

30:37.502 --> 30:38.696
You call this small?

30:39.370 --> 30:41.861
Built through hard work.

30:42.073 --> 30:44.974
Frankly, what I really need

30:45.210 --> 30:49.271
is someone with experience:
A delivery man, handyman, stock boy.

30:49.547 --> 30:52.710
Someone who can open
in the morning and close at night.

30:52.917 --> 30:55.511
But I'd really prefer
to take you on instead.

30:55.720 --> 30:58.314
- Thank the gentleman, Fausto.
- Thank you.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.417
Don't mention it.

31:00.625 --> 31:05.324
I'm pleased to give
a young man a start in life.

31:06.397 --> 31:08.797
Feel right at home.
When can you start?

31:09.000 --> 31:10.467
- Right now!
- Now?

31:10.668 --> 31:13.501
Sure, you can start
learning the ropes.

31:13.705 --> 31:17.163
Giulia, this is Sandra's husband.
He'll be working here now.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.570
- Hello. The truck is here.
- I'll be right there.

31:19.777 --> 31:22.075
Shouldn't he get one of these?

31:22.981 --> 31:26.542
A work coat? I have an extra
he can use right over here.

31:26.651 --> 31:28.676
- Just to keep the dust off.
- Here we are.

31:29.954 --> 31:31.979
Wait, Giulia.

31:32.490 --> 31:33.354
Try it on.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.789
Mama'll make one just for you.

31:38.830 --> 31:41.321
Something wrong?
It's just been cleaned.

31:41.933 --> 31:44.231
Button up and tie the belt.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.569
Looks like it was tailor-made for him.

31:50.775 --> 31:52.242
Very nice.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.406
Now, young man, you start work.

31:55.613 --> 31:58.173
There are crates to unload.

31:58.383 --> 32:01.079
Get the shipping log from my wife.

32:06.658 --> 32:09.786
And keep an eye on the men
or they'll break everything.

32:09.994 --> 32:12.292
It's fragile stuff. Get going.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.767
- There he is.
- What's he doing?

33:15.193 --> 33:18.287
Come on, leave him alone.
He'll lose his job.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.311
How are you? Welcome back.

33:34.579 --> 33:37.343
- You look great.
- What a pretty hat.

33:38.182 --> 33:39.774
- You just got back?
- Yesterday.

33:39.984 --> 33:43.647
- How's married life?
- Where's Fausto?

33:43.855 --> 33:45.652
- He's got a job.
- He's working?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.415
Yes, I'm on my way to meet him.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.058
You're wise to keep an eye on him.

33:49.260 --> 33:54.061
Why? Fausto's a good boy.
He's just a little fickle.

33:54.265 --> 33:56.631
Do you like your new place?

33:56.834 --> 33:58.426
We're staying with Mama for now.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.332
Of course, you had so little time.

34:01.539 --> 34:03.734
Everything was so rushed.

34:03.941 --> 34:07.001
You're hardly showing at all.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.270
It's still a long way off, isn't it?

34:09.480 --> 34:12.141
- Sorry, I've got to run. Bye.
- Bye, dear.

34:14.284 --> 34:16.275
Let's get together,
and bring Fausto too.

34:30.201 --> 34:32.897
- I came to get you.
- Terrific!

34:33.871 --> 34:35.304
Watch this.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.666
How's that?
- Bravo!

34:41.379 --> 34:44.313
Fausto, not in public!

34:44.514 --> 34:46.277
What's the big deal?
We're married.

34:46.484 --> 34:49.146
Guess what.
Today I sold a statue this tall.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.014
- Really?
- Yes.

34:51.121 --> 34:52.282
I'm so proud of you.

34:52.389 --> 34:55.416
And now let's go to the movies.

34:55.626 --> 34:57.321
- Great!
- We have enough to get in?

34:57.528 --> 34:58.859
Yes, I've got it right here.

34:59.063 --> 35:00.826
That's my baby.

35:08.039 --> 35:10.132
There's a couple of seats over there.

35:25.389 --> 35:26.822
Is this okay?

35:27.024 --> 35:28.423
Can you see?

35:28.926 --> 35:31.486
- What a nice refrigerator.
- Soon we'll get one too.

35:32.763 --> 35:34.128
How adorable.

35:39.437 --> 35:41.268
Looking for your cigarettes?

35:42.340 --> 35:44.638
Thanks. I've got matches.

35:46.277 --> 35:48.245
Know what?
Papa really likes you.

35:48.446 --> 35:52.280
This morning Mama told me

35:52.483 --> 35:55.179
Papa is planning
an addition to the house.

35:55.386 --> 35:58.150
But it's to be a surprise.
- Got it.

35:58.356 --> 36:00.017
A light, please.

36:05.029 --> 36:05.927
Thanks.

36:06.230 --> 36:06.958
My pleasure.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.539
- So we can live together.
- What?

36:17.241 --> 36:19.209
So we can live together.

36:19.410 --> 36:20.104
Sure.

36:29.620 --> 36:34.353
<i>- Don't believe him, my dear.</i>
<i>- You mean I should trust you?</i>

36:34.559 --> 36:37.084
<i>I knew he found me irritating.</i>

36:55.379 --> 36:57.677
- Terrific, aren't they?
- Yeah, really good.

37:48.432 --> 37:52.027
Excuse me for a minute.
Be right back. Hold my seat.

37:52.236 --> 37:55.228
- You feeling okay?
- I'm fine. I'll be right back.

38:16.427 --> 38:17.086
Ma'am.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.595
Pardon me.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.704
Good evening, ma'am.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.084
When will I see you again?
- What do you want?

38:41.285 --> 38:44.812
- Your phone number.
- My number? Get lost.

38:45.022 --> 38:48.048
Wait, don't shut the door.
I must talk to you.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.499
- Are you out of your mind?
- I recognize you from the boardwalk.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.797
This summer you wore
that white bathing suit.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.632
So what?
I recognize you too.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.167
You were with a young lady
at the movie theater.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.503
Not me! When can I see you again?

39:08.746 --> 39:11.579
Get out of here.
I'm a married woman.

39:12.116 --> 39:13.845
My maid is upstairs.

39:18.622 --> 39:20.886
Let me see you.
Tomorrow night?

39:21.092 --> 39:22.787
No. Never.

39:23.327 --> 39:24.817
Day after tomorrow?

39:25.930 --> 39:28.296
Then when?
- Whenever we meet again.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.134
Let's leave it to fate.
Good-bye.

39:31.535 --> 39:32.331
Please, don't go yet.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.932
I must speak with you.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.107
Come back. Listen.

39:38.809 --> 39:41.573
I've got to speak with you.
- Go away!

40:24.722 --> 40:26.952
- Sandra, what are you doing here?
- Where were you?

40:28.192 --> 40:32.458
I had promised to see a guy off
at the train station.

40:32.663 --> 40:35.359
Am I late? Is the movie over?

40:35.566 --> 40:36.794
Too bad.

40:37.635 --> 40:41.002
How'd it end? Did she die?
- No, she didn't.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.729
- So what happened?
- They got married.

40:42.940 --> 40:46.603
What a fine actress. We saw her
in that movie when we were in Rome.

40:46.811 --> 40:48.244
What was the name of that picture?

40:48.579 --> 40:50.103
Sandra, are you crying?

40:51.482 --> 40:53.916
Yes, you are. What's wrong?

40:55.219 --> 40:56.413
I'm scared.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.212
Scared? Of what?

41:01.392 --> 41:03.917
I don't know.
I'm just scared, Fausto.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.117
I'm sorry.

41:12.169 --> 41:14.069
Don't, Sandrina.

41:14.738 --> 41:18.504
Don't worry. I'm being silly.
I just feel very sad.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.940
Sandra, there's no reason.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.341
I love you very much.

41:25.616 --> 41:27.675
Let me hold your little hand.

41:28.919 --> 41:31.114
I feel better now, darling.

41:31.889 --> 41:33.618
I can't stand to see you cry.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.725
I won't cry anymore.
Just be near me.

41:36.927 --> 41:38.622
I'll always be near you.

41:40.931 --> 41:43.627
- Let's go home.
- Yes, let's.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.067
<i>In the months that followed,</i>

41:53.277 --> 41:57.714
<i>the most important events were</i>
<i>Riccardo's mustache - just like Fausto's -</i>

41:57.915 --> 41:59.212
<i>and Alberto's sideburns.</i>

42:06.624 --> 42:09.320
<i>Fausto had, by now,</i>
<i>shaved his mustache.</i>

42:10.895 --> 42:14.353
<i>Occasionally his father and sister</i>
<i>would pass by the shop</i>

42:14.932 --> 42:16.661
<i>to see him at work.</i>

42:17.535 --> 42:21.471
<i>Leopoldo worked as usual.</i>
<i>He, in turn, cultivated a goatee.</i>

42:21.672 --> 42:22.502
It's scary.

42:24.441 --> 42:25.965
I thought you'd like it.

42:31.148 --> 42:34.982
<i>And, at last, the eagerly awaited</i>
<i>carnival season.</i>

42:50.000 --> 42:53.902
It'll be better this year.
People seem anxious to celebrate.

42:54.171 --> 42:56.401
Add a beauty mark on the other side.
- Nah, one's enough.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.097
Is my dress ready?
- Yes.

42:58.309 --> 43:03.474
Now leave me alone or your mother
will kill me. I have to do the sheets.

43:03.681 --> 43:07.879
- I need bigger breasts.
- I padded it in front.

43:08.686 --> 43:12.144
Look what he's done to himself,
such a good-looking boy.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.916
- So, you're sweet on Alberto?
- What a mouth.

43:17.494 --> 43:20.327
- Alberto, she's in love with you.
- Yeah, even Mama's noticed.

43:20.531 --> 43:23.398
- Is she really loaded?
- Why, do you want to marry her?

43:23.667 --> 43:26.101
Elvira, my hat.

43:26.303 --> 43:28.100
I don't have your hat.

43:28.305 --> 43:30.796
So who's got it?
Hold this. Mama.

43:32.676 --> 43:35.509
You're still here?
I'm ready to go now.

43:35.713 --> 43:37.044
I'm not going.

43:37.247 --> 43:39.772
Then let me have your hat.

43:40.050 --> 43:42.143
Come on.
- You know I don't wear hats.

43:42.353 --> 43:43.251
What am I gonna do?

43:45.823 --> 43:49.418
It's just not fair. When you wanna
have a good time, no one helps.

43:49.627 --> 43:53.427
Look in the trunk. You'll find something,
but don't make a mess.

43:54.798 --> 43:58.097
What's up? Why's she crying?

43:59.603 --> 44:02.902
What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a slight headache.

44:06.710 --> 44:08.644
You and I are gonna have it out.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.446
Alberto, come and look.
This chest is full of stuff.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.710
Don't mess things up.
Your mother will have a fit.

44:15.919 --> 44:19.377
Riccardo, I'm sure these are
the right moves. Watch me.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.182
Who's this bearded guy?

44:22.259 --> 44:23.851
That's my poor old man.

44:25.295 --> 44:27.525
Leopoldo, look at these pictures.

44:27.731 --> 44:28.891
Here's the hat.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.625
Look what I found.
- They're hilarious.

44:31.835 --> 44:33.769
- Who is that?
- I don't have a clue.

44:33.971 --> 44:35.666
What a kook!

44:35.873 --> 44:37.773
Look at me.

45:06.203 --> 45:07.192
Look at Alberto!

45:11.175 --> 45:12.767
Wanna dance?
- Yes, dear.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.776
- Mama, we're gonna dance.
- Don't exert yourself.

45:18.415 --> 45:20.110
Ever been up to the rafters
in this theater?

45:20.317 --> 45:21.944
No, and I have no desire to.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.560
Leopoldo, wait for me!

45:31.829 --> 45:34.389
What a coincidence -
we're both Chinese.

45:39.136 --> 45:41.104
I love you so much.

45:43.373 --> 45:44.533
And I love you too.

45:44.842 --> 45:47.140
- Why're you squeezing me?
- That's the Chinese way.

45:47.344 --> 45:50.404
- I'm going to get a drink.
- The bar's that way.

46:00.157 --> 46:04.753
I'll bet that one day you'll come here
to see one of my plays.

46:04.962 --> 46:06.691
I like variety shows.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.387
- What'll you have to drink?
- An orangeade.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.625
- Antonio, an orangeade.
- An orangeade, right away!

46:12.736 --> 46:15.432
Ever been up to the rafters
in this theater?

46:15.639 --> 46:17.436
- Recognize me?
- Of course I do!

46:20.811 --> 46:22.472
Here alone?
- No, with some girlfriends.

46:25.215 --> 46:26.876
Your costume is cute.

46:27.584 --> 46:29.449
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.951
I made a last-minute decision
to come.

46:32.156 --> 46:33.589
We'll have a dance later.
- Sure.

46:33.757 --> 46:35.054
Gisella, wait!

46:35.259 --> 46:36.089
Who's he?

46:36.794 --> 46:39.490
A great writer.
He's my neighbor, you know.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.590
Whiskey, darling?

46:41.799 --> 46:45.394
Whiskey? I want a sandwich.
A large one.

46:45.602 --> 46:46.728
Antonio, a sandwich.

46:47.237 --> 46:49.262
Here, ma'am, just made.

46:49.473 --> 46:50.838
Isn't this fun?

46:51.275 --> 46:53.869
A glass of milk.
- Right away, sir.

46:55.279 --> 46:57.440
Why the ham sandwich?

46:59.183 --> 47:00.741
- Because it's good.
- You're always eating.

47:02.052 --> 47:04.145
- I'm hungry.
- It doesn't look good!

47:15.399 --> 47:16.832
What a nice nose!

47:18.235 --> 47:19.862
May I dance with my sister?

47:20.070 --> 47:21.298
Go right ahead.

47:21.505 --> 47:22.995
Lose the sandwich!

47:25.609 --> 47:26.906
Come on.

47:30.414 --> 47:32.348
I'm going to show her the rafters.

47:32.549 --> 47:34.073
I'm starving.

47:34.284 --> 47:37.185
- Cognac, Giulia?
- No, no. I'm feeling dizzy already.

47:37.454 --> 47:38.352
Good evening.

47:40.657 --> 47:41.555
Good evening.

47:45.729 --> 47:48.459
Having fun?
- Lots. Aren't you?

47:52.002 --> 47:52.730
Yeah.

47:53.804 --> 47:55.738
Listen, they're playing
the Sioux Mambo.

47:55.939 --> 47:59.534
- Yes, it's a beautiful song.
- May I?

48:00.944 --> 48:03.469
Actually, I'm not alone.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.978
- Giulia, listen.
- Good evening, sir.

48:06.183 --> 48:08.651
Why don't we go over
to the other spread?

48:08.752 --> 48:10.117
Excuse me.

48:12.756 --> 48:15.884
Two orangeades, Antonio.
Why that face?

48:16.093 --> 48:17.993
- Did you see Michele's wife?
- No, who?

48:18.195 --> 48:22.962
My boss's wife. She's really classy.
Put it on my tab, Antonio.

48:37.881 --> 48:40.372
I don't think you've got it right.

48:43.520 --> 48:44.817
A master like me?

48:45.055 --> 48:47.683
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

48:52.162 --> 48:53.356
Where are you taking me?

48:58.702 --> 49:02.468
- Look, it's breathtaking.
- I'm getting dizzy.

49:02.673 --> 49:04.903
- Then don't look down.
- Now what?

49:05.108 --> 49:08.407
Nothing.
Tomorrow we'll go for a drive.

49:08.612 --> 49:10.944
- I'm not going.
- Of course you are.

49:11.148 --> 49:13.378
One more kiss on that lovely neck.

49:13.583 --> 49:15.983
Please.

49:16.186 --> 49:18.347
You're so annoying.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.123
Stop, stop now.

51:15.439 --> 51:19.273
Get out of here
with that damn trumpet!

51:27.117 --> 51:29.483
Come with me, sweet little head.

51:32.355 --> 51:34.550
Anita, come on.
Let's go to Mass.

51:47.437 --> 51:50.873
Why won't you believe me?

51:55.345 --> 51:57.973
Alberto, what's wrong?
Feeling sick?

51:58.782 --> 52:00.147
I'm okay.

52:00.350 --> 52:02.545
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- I'm okay.

52:02.752 --> 52:05.118
Get out of here.
- Moraldo.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.290
I'm taking you home.

52:07.491 --> 52:09.482
Go to Peking, why don't you.

52:09.693 --> 52:13.891
- Moraldo, leave him alone.
- I can't. He's a friend.

52:15.732 --> 52:17.666
Come on.
- Let go, I'm okay.

52:23.874 --> 52:27.571
- Hey, let's go swimming.
- Yeah, but home first.

52:27.777 --> 52:30.302
- Okay, home first.
- And then we go swimming.

52:30.514 --> 52:33.779
- Then we go swimming.
- We'll all go together.

52:35.185 --> 52:39.019
- Who the hell are you? Who?
- It's me, Moraldo.

52:39.890 --> 52:44.850
No, you're nobody.
You're all nobodies.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.725
What do you think you're doing?

52:51.968 --> 52:55.927
- Nothing, nothing.
- You make me puke. Let me go.

52:56.139 --> 52:58.903
But Alberto, if I let you go...

52:59.109 --> 53:00.906
Let me go.
I wanna go by myself.

53:01.144 --> 53:04.272
- Alberto, you'll get hurt.
- I want to go alone. I'll be okay.

53:04.481 --> 53:05.505
You're nothing.

53:05.849 --> 53:09.148
- Alberto, look out, you'll fall.
- You make me puke.

53:09.753 --> 53:12.950
- Moraldo, please, let's go.
- I can't just leave him.

53:13.156 --> 53:15.886
May I come along now?
- Yeah, sure.

53:16.126 --> 53:17.286
Come on, come on.

53:17.894 --> 53:22.194
What do you want with me?
- Nothing. Just keep walking.

53:22.732 --> 53:24.393
Moraldo, know what?

53:26.670 --> 53:29.468
We gotta get married.
- Yes.

53:32.142 --> 53:33.575
You see Fausto?

53:34.211 --> 53:38.409
He settled down.
He's happy.

53:38.615 --> 53:41.311
He has a house.
We just gotta get ourselves wives.

53:41.518 --> 53:42.849
Hey, Alberto!

53:44.354 --> 53:48.120
You gotta get married, Riccardo.
You just gotta.

53:48.325 --> 53:50.020
Okay, bye.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.888
See, I told him too.

53:55.732 --> 53:59.293
You know what we'll do instead?

53:59.402 --> 54:01.597
We'll go to Brazil.

54:02.572 --> 54:04.472
We'll take her along.

54:04.674 --> 54:05.902
Yeah, right.

54:08.178 --> 54:10.043
Brazil... by boat.

54:14.150 --> 54:15.981
Yeah, but first we go home.

54:16.186 --> 54:17.949
You gonna leave me here?

54:18.154 --> 54:21.248
I can't just leave him.
You come too.

54:54.557 --> 54:57.754
Alberto, you're home.
Do you want me to take you in?

54:57.961 --> 55:00.429
I don't wanna go home.
What's there for me?

55:06.503 --> 55:08.994
I've been waiting for you.

55:09.205 --> 55:11.400
I wanted to say good-bye.

55:11.608 --> 55:14.441
I'm leaving, Alberto. Forgive me.

55:14.644 --> 55:17.044
I just couldn't take it anymore.

55:18.181 --> 55:19.978
Take care of Mama.

55:20.183 --> 55:22.174
I'll always think of you.

55:25.522 --> 55:26.614
Good-bye.

55:28.058 --> 55:29.889
Bye, Alberto.

55:35.665 --> 55:37.633
Try to be sensible, Alberto.

55:44.341 --> 55:47.208
Olga, where are you going?

55:48.511 --> 55:49.808
Where's she going?

56:22.812 --> 56:25.246
Mama, what's going on?

56:25.515 --> 56:29.042
You can see. She's gone.

56:29.252 --> 56:32.653
How can my own daughter
do this to me?

56:32.856 --> 56:35.723
After all I've sacrificed for her.

56:37.961 --> 56:41.021
Don't cry, Mama.

56:43.199 --> 56:47.226
I'll stay. I'll always be here.

56:48.671 --> 56:52.607
You'll see, she'll change her mind
and come home. If not, better yet.

56:52.909 --> 56:58.006
For the few pennies she gave us.

56:58.114 --> 56:59.877
Good riddance!

57:02.819 --> 57:05.515
I'll get a job.

57:07.390 --> 57:09.790
- Really, Alberto? You will?
- Of course.

57:10.460 --> 57:11.893
Have you found something?

57:13.129 --> 57:14.756
Have you found something?

57:33.216 --> 57:35.514
- Good morning.
- See what that lady wants.

57:35.718 --> 57:38.209
- What lady?
- That lady. Over there.

57:38.588 --> 57:40.419
Hello. May I help you?

57:40.623 --> 57:43.251
Two candles,
the kind I bought last year.

57:43.460 --> 57:45.792
I wasn't here last year.

57:45.995 --> 57:47.986
She wants the same candles
she bought last year.

57:48.198 --> 57:50.166
So get them for her.
They're in the stockroom.

57:52.635 --> 57:53.863
Sir.

57:53.970 --> 57:54.664
Excuse me.

57:55.338 --> 57:56.600
Did you enjoy yourself last night?

57:57.273 --> 58:01.539
Try to get here earlier.
It's 11:00. We open at 9:00.

58:01.778 --> 58:03.541
My friend's sister ran away.

58:03.746 --> 58:06.010
Someone runs away every night.
You always have an excuse.

58:06.249 --> 58:08.114
- And I have a toothache.
- Get to work.

58:25.668 --> 58:27.932
Giulia, see what's happened
back there.

58:28.872 --> 58:30.567
I apologize.
Look at the craftsmanship.

58:31.608 --> 58:33.769
- What happened?
- They fell.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.976
Please, I'll take care of it.
I'm sorry.

58:57.000 --> 58:59.764
- Well?
- Just paying you back.

59:01.538 --> 59:03.529
Carnival is over.

59:12.315 --> 59:17.116
You should always wear
what you did last night.

59:45.515 --> 59:47.710
Hand me the receipts in that drawer.

59:47.917 --> 59:49.316
Which drawer?

59:49.652 --> 59:51.210
That drawer under the counter.

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:03.764
- The receipts you requested.
- Thank you.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.468
What are you doing?
I got no sleep last night.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:10.639
I waltzed with you
in my dreams, all night long.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.308
- Put away these books, please.
- Give me a hand.

01:00:13.509 --> 01:00:15.409
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:19.643
How passionate! Last night
I realized you're a real woman.

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:21.316
You must be drunk!

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:27.082
Yes, drunk with you,
your flesh, your scent.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:29.615
Enough! Stop this right now!

01:00:29.826 --> 01:00:32.294
You trying to tell me
you don't like it?

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.565
Please keep quiet about this.

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:50.674
It's sunny, but quite chilly.

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:09.729
Hello. Do you have
some angel ornaments?

01:01:20.576 --> 01:01:23.602
- Good night, sir. I'll go out this way.
- Wait a minute.

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:31.053
Why not come up
and have a drink with us?

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:34.951
Today's our anniversary.
Fifteen years.

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:37.991
Congratulations,
but I wouldn't want to intrude.

01:01:38.194 --> 01:01:41.095
On the contrary.
We'd love it.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:45.734
If I'd known, I would've brought
flowers or something.

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:47.425
Nonsense.

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.639
We live upstairs.
It's very convenient.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.331
After you.
- Thank you.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.341
Allow me.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:07.087
Come right in.

01:02:08.024 --> 01:02:10.993
Giulia, please bring
some vermouth.

01:02:12.495 --> 01:02:15.259
Giulia, the vermouth.
- Yes, Michele.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.693
Have a seat.

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.692
- It's lovely.
- You like it?

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:22.166
- Really lovely.
- Modest, but we like it.

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.205
I'm about to get our place set up.

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:27.638
- Is that so?
- Is that a real antique?

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:30.335
Yes. Here's the vermouth.

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:33.174
Evening, ma'am. Congratulations.
I hear it's your...

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:36.249
Thank you. I've got to finish.

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:37.919
Go ahead, dear.

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:40.522
Go ahead.

01:02:42.658 --> 01:02:44.057
My wife's a good woman, no?

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.319
Yes, very good, and...

01:02:46.529 --> 01:02:47.427
And what?

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:48.964
A good woman.

01:02:49.398 --> 01:02:50.729
Ah, yes.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:55.231
We're not so young,
but we still get along well.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.463
Since we have few friends,

01:02:57.573 --> 01:03:01.031
we spend most evenings
in this room.

01:03:03.179 --> 01:03:05.670
Sometimes we play cards.

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:09.214
That probably sounds dull
to you, no?

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:12.785
You'll find it amusing
that we play cards.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:17.016
Sometimes I read
while my wife knits.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.018
But we're not bored,
and do you know why?

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:23.492
Because we really
love each other.

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.097
But you wouldn't understand.

01:03:28.237 --> 01:03:30.228
Of course I understand.

01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:32.974
No, you don't.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:34.905
- But I really do.
- No, you don't.

01:03:35.678 --> 01:03:37.669
I really pity you.

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:43.311
And I pity your poor wife even more.

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:45.384
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:48.380
This.
Here's your month salary.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:52.550
Make up an excuse for your family.
Say you didn't like it. Too much work.

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:55.697
Give them any excuse.
You're really good at that.

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.492
But why are you firing me?

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.498
So you'll learn to live right.

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:06.037
I treated you like a brother
and you acted like a cad!

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:10.572
Now get out of here,
before I wring your neck.

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.349
I never expected this from you.

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.981
No, leave her out of this.

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:25.320
Giulia, Fausto's going.
He won't be working for us any longer.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.453
He just quit.

01:04:27.663 --> 01:04:30.029
So I shouldn't come in tomorrow?

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:33.094
Good evening.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:41.934
I was only kidding around, ma'am.

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.955
I lost my job

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:57.487
because of that silly woman,
my boss's wife.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:58.853
Who's that?

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:04.192
She came on to me, but out of respect
for Michele, I turned her down.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:08.496
She's an old lady. How could I go
for her? So she bad-mouthed me.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:10.936
And today he made up
some excuse to fire me.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.974
- What excuse?
- Huh?

01:05:13.142 --> 01:05:14.973
He just can't do that.
It's way too easy.

01:05:15.177 --> 01:05:19.307
Oh, he can and did. He said,
"Tell your family anything you like.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:20.812
Find any excuse at all."

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:25.784
That's unfair. You shouldn't have left.
And no severance at all, nothing?

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:29.446
He should have given you notice -
a month at least.

01:05:29.725 --> 01:05:31.022
No, no notice.

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:33.695
A month at least. He can't just
cheat you out of 30,000 lire.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.525
One can't just do that today.
You work. You've got a job.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.713
That was refreshing.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:59.017
Not drinking?
Aren't you thirsty?

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:04.717
Moraldo, can you keep a secret?

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:07.361
I don't know. Why?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.899
My boss should've
given me notice, right?

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:16.228
So I'm gonna get what's mine,
and we'll split it.

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.401
I don't understand.

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.341
Would you be up
to pulling off a job?

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:26.979
- A job?
- You know.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.780
- No. What do I have to do?
- Are you chicken?

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.319
- No.
- Then let's go.

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.087
Follow me.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.236
- Quiet.
- No, out of the way.

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:02.308
Where the hell are we?
- Quiet.

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:06.883
In the courtyard.

01:07:09.558 --> 01:07:11.685
Be careful. We don't want
to burn down the house.

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.831
- Where are you?
- Over here.

01:07:29.945 --> 01:07:31.173
What's that?

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.382
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:36.514
- What is it?
- An angel.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.186
Now we've gotta get it out.

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:43.619
You know how much it's worth?
40,000 lire. I saw the bill.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.994
And you're stealing it?
Let's split, Fausto.

01:07:48.197 --> 01:07:52.827
It's not theft. It was unpacked
and got left here. It's been two months.

01:07:52.935 --> 01:07:55.199
No one's noticed.
And you said I should've gotten notice.

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:56.896
So we'll take this instead.

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.471
But it's wrong.

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:07.175
Listen, Moraldo,
I have a family now. I need this.

01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:10.112
I've got a lot of things
to take care of.

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.354
If you're scared, I'll go it alone.

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:17.816
At least give me some light here.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.495
Look how beautiful.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.265
Beautiful.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:44.481
- Tell him to be quiet.
- Giudizio, cut it out!

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.635
Good morning, Sister.
Is Mother Superior in?

01:09:08.844 --> 01:09:09.742
Why?

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.609
I'd like to discuss some business
I think she'd find in her interest.

01:09:12.848 --> 01:09:14.975
What is it?
Mother Superior's in chapel now.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:15.843
Let's go.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.684
No, Moraldo, wait.
Let's show her.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:21.750
Show her.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:31.365
An angel, solid wood. It's been
in our house, but we're forced to sell.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:35.799
The Ursuline Convent
could have it for a reasonable price.

01:09:35.938 --> 01:09:38.133
Just look at that expression.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.572
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.640
Don't be afraid.
He's harmless.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.836
We already have
enough angels. Sorry.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:46.575
Sister, listen.

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:03.129
A brother, way up!

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:08.136
What do you want?

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:11.363
How are you today?
Would you like a cigarette?

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:14.008
Wait a moment. Here, catch.

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.068
Terrific.

01:10:19.415 --> 01:10:22.282
It's lovely here. This is the life.

01:10:22.484 --> 01:10:23.917
What's your name?

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.748
- Father Felice.
- Is the Father Superior in?

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:27.183
No.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.954
- So who's in charge in his absence?
- I am.

01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:33.686
Wonderful. We have
a real bargain for you.

01:10:33.963 --> 01:10:38.491
A magnificent statue.
Colorful, perfect for the altar.

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.566
- Is that it?
- Yes.

01:10:44.506 --> 01:10:45.803
Show it to him.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:50.677
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.006
Isn't it beautiful?
Look how expressive.

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.012
Where did you get it?

01:10:55.451 --> 01:10:57.476
It's from our house,
but we've got no place for it.

01:10:57.686 --> 01:11:00.211
We thought it would look
better in your church.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:03.653
We have no need for it here.

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.831
<i>They were unable to sell</i>
<i>the statue that day.</i>

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:19.030
<i>So that evening, Fausto and</i>
<i>Moraldo entrusted it to Giudizio</i>

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:20.765
<i>with a thousand instructions.</i>

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:15.227
Here's Papa.

01:12:17.766 --> 01:12:19.063
Good evening, Papa.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:23.570
Moraldo, come here.
Don't make me come after you!

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:27.198
- Papa, what did I do?
- You really have to ask?

01:12:28.243 --> 01:12:31.735
Hoodlum! Cheat!
Wait till I get hold of you!

01:12:31.947 --> 01:12:32.936
I haven't done anything.

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:35.412
What's the matter?
What's the poor boy done?

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:38.142
Poor boy! He's a monster!

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:43.553
We're all disgraced! Thieves!
Get out! Both of you!

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:44.716
What did they do?

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:46.384
They stole a statue!

01:12:46.595 --> 01:12:49.621
- No, Papa.
- Liars!

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:56.595
These two... I had to beg the police
not to arrest you in my home.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.739
Yes, the police, in my own home!

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:05.703
And this pig tried to force himself
on the wife of my dearest friend.

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:21.520
A pack of lies! I'm shocked
you believed them! Very shocked!

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.095
And you dare raise your voice?

01:13:23.298 --> 01:13:27.394
Yes, I will! You treat me like
a five-year old! I'm 30!

01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:32.836
Keep your crummy food!
You'll never see me again! Never!

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:56.553
It wasn't his fault.
Giulia came on to him,

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.966
then lied to her husband.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.201
Sandra, are you listening to me?

01:14:04.406 --> 01:14:05.430
Really?

01:14:05.641 --> 01:14:09.737
Yeah. Fausto never encouraged her.

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:13.440
Wouldn't give her a second glance.

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.978
And then they wouldn't pay him.

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:22.085
So we took the statue.

01:14:24.426 --> 01:14:26.155
He really didn't make a pass at her?

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.090
I swear.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.123
Now stop crying.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.199
Where is he now?

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.309
Out in the garden.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.649
I'm waiting for Moraldo.

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.758
Tell Papa I'm leaving.
I don't want to be a burden.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:01.988
What are you saying?
Moraldo told me everything.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.833
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry, I'll tell Papa

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:10.169
that that woman flirted with you.

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:16.972
- Let's forget about it.
- No, they have to know the truth.

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:22.513
Here, your cutlet.
You haven't eaten a thing.

01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:30.458
Damn it!

01:15:31.326 --> 01:15:33.851
Why did you take the statue?

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:38.294
Did you need money?
You should have told me, Fausto.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:42.266
Why didn't you? There should be
no secrets between us.

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:46.703
We have to cling to each other.
All we have is each other.

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.503
Mama is very kind,

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:52.776
but she treats me like a baby.

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:56.439
And Papa is always so busy.
He doesn't even know me.

01:15:56.785 --> 01:16:00.414
You're all I have, Fausto.
If you leave too...

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.898
Sandra, don't.

01:16:15.837 --> 01:16:19.000
- Do you still love me, Fausto?
- Yes.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:25.809
- Do you love our baby?
- Sandra, my Sandrina, our baby.

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:30.275
So will you stay with me?

01:16:30.485 --> 01:16:31.884
Yes.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:37.215
Then come on home.
Let's go talk to Papa.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:46.890
<i>So Fausto was forgiven and started</i>
<i>leisurely looking for another job.</i>

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:54.302
<i>They didn't pay him much attention</i>
<i>at home once the baby was born.</i>

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:57.808
<i>A veritable Adonis,</i>
<i>he looked just like Mama, Papa,</i>

01:16:58.013 --> 01:17:00.641
<i>Uncle, Grandfather, Grandmother</i>
<i>and even Moraldo.</i>

01:17:00.882 --> 01:17:04.682
He looks like my math teacher.
He's so ugly!

01:17:04.953 --> 01:17:09.788
<i>Sandra was happy, and one day</i>
<i>she quietly took the baby</i>

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:13.758
<i>to meet her father-in-law.</i>

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:16.157
- The coffee is almost ready.
- Good girl.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:20.062
Moraldino, why are you so fat?

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:23.432
Yesterday he said "blue."
I wonder what he meant.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.130
Has Fausto found a job?

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:31.913
I guess so.
He should start in a matter of days.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.512
Excuse me, Papa.
I'll see about the coffee.

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:38.845
- No, I'll go.
- Please, let me go.

01:17:39.054 --> 01:17:45.254
- Sandra, can I hold him?
- Be careful with him, Mirella.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:49.789
Come on, Moraldino,
give your auntie a kiss.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.660
No, Papa, you don't know
how to hold him.

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.099
That's no way to hold a baby.

01:17:58.373 --> 01:18:00.068
I don't know that one.

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:05.170
- Is that the farthest?
- Yes, it's called Sirius.

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.880
- Are there people living there?
- I don't think so.

01:18:11.753 --> 01:18:13.550
- Would you live there?
- Yes.

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.814
- I don't believe you.
- Sure I would.

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:19.449
- Will you walk me home?
- Sure.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:26.999
<i>The evenings were getting warmer.</i>
<i>Spring was in the air.</i>

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:56.259
<i>And now, a man whose heart</i>
<i>is as great as his name.</i>

01:18:57.099 --> 01:18:59.397
That's him. He's brilliant.
Listen.

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:03.226
<i>Mr. Sergio Natali.</i>

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:16.707
I shall recite <i>Reminiscence of Youth.</i>

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:18.317
- Is that Natali?
- Yes.

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:19.680
He's uglier than sin.

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.546
Grandpa, when is Papa coming home?

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:27.961
Little one,
your papa has already returned.

01:19:28.163 --> 01:19:31.655
He's here, lost in the crowd.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:34.527
He's watching you, smiling at you.
He just brushed by you.

01:19:34.736 --> 01:19:37.534
And you, little one,
didn't feel a thing.

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:39.400
Why not, Grandpa?

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:43.577
Because you're innocent.

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:49.678
Your papa left in the spring,
just like your grandpa.

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:52.920
As a lieutenant, amid flowers,

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:58.483
songs and a flag.

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:12.729
<i>Leopoldo has long awaited</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

01:20:12.941 --> 01:20:15.239
<i>The great actor has read his play</i>

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:18.140
<i>and will see him in his dressing room</i>
<i>after the performance.</i>

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.756
<i>His big moment has come.</i>

01:21:36.224 --> 01:21:39.022
<i>Even we grasped</i>
<i>the importance of this meeting,</i>

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:41.695
<i>and we were as excited</i>
<i>as Leopoldo.</i>

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:57.869
Ah, I see you've brought company.
Please, come in.

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.274
Please, come in.

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:03.781
Bring some chairs.
- That's all right, sir. We'll stand.

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.748
Forgive the candle.

01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:09.548
In these second-rate theaters,
they always steal the light bulbs.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:12.727
- Of course, sir. It's nothing.
- May I offer you a cigarette?

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:15.887
They're domestic, you know.

01:22:16.097 --> 01:22:19.396
American cigarettes
are very bad for you.

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:22.732
- Sir, I'm a great admirer.
- I saw you in <i>I due Foscari.</i>

01:22:24.039 --> 01:22:27.873
Yes, well, the best parts
were left on the cutting room floor.

01:22:28.076 --> 01:22:31.568
Please, have a seat
while I finish removing my makeup.

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:39.051
Sir, I've admired you for years.

01:22:39.254 --> 01:22:42.849
I saw you for the first time
in Bologna, in 1943.

01:22:43.124 --> 01:22:45.115
It was an unforgettable evening.

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.029
You revealed lbsen to me.
- Ibsen. Those were the days.

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:51.630
Feels like yesterday.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.866
Being principal actor
is hard work, my friend.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:59.873
And you're seeing me during a break,
a vacation, I'd like to call it.

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:01.970
It's temporary, of course.

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.166
Fausto, look who's here.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:07.805
Let me tell you,
I have great ideas for next season.

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:11.144
I want to put together
an amazing cast.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:14.186
A cast that will make history.

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:16.949
I might be able to get Ferrati,
and perhaps even Gassman.

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.892
Did you hear that?
He's gonna get Ferrati and Gassman.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:24.258
I want young playwrights, both
for the grants and for the challenge.

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:25.831
By the way,

01:23:26.267 --> 01:23:28.030
I read your piece.

01:23:29.070 --> 01:23:31.004
Skimmed it, really.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:35.167
You understand, I'm always so busy.
The theater is a tyrant.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.944
But you've got it.

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.808
You really liked it?

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:45.552
You've got it here... and here.

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:47.686
Sir.

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:52.152
"I'm a product of my time.
I am, alas, powerless.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:55.661
Do you understand, Frida,
the writhing agony of my soul?"

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.561
Frida laughs.

01:23:57.665 --> 01:23:59.326
"I understand, Roberto,
that you are consumed by pride..."

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:00.833
Salt.

01:24:00.935 --> 01:24:02.698
"...by your being. Roberto laughs.

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:06.940
What more damage can pride do
to a soul already ruined?

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.408
Blind man!
Only fear could save you."

01:24:09.644 --> 01:24:14.013
Blind man!
Only fear could save you.

01:24:14.549 --> 01:24:17.177
Brilliant! But that was Frida's line.
She goes on.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:21.114
"In the silence of your desert,
don't you hear a voice calling you?"

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:23.347
Robert, ironic: "Your voice, Frida?"

01:24:23.558 --> 01:24:25.583
"No... God's."

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:29.728
So ends Act II.

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:33.030
Beautiful.
Don't you think it's good?

01:24:33.234 --> 01:24:35.862
- I like it.
- May I start Act III?

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:38.665
- Go on.
- Act III, Scene i.

01:24:41.476 --> 01:24:42.465
The door!

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.238
I'll close it.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.810
Waiter, what have you got?

01:24:49.050 --> 01:24:50.915
- Have you eaten, sir?
- May I go on, sir?

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.552
Very well, thank you.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.314
- Of course, read on.
- Act III, Scene i.

01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:05.098
What's the omelet Romagnola?
The one with all that grease?

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.099
- It's our specialty, with béhamel.
- All right, I'll have that.

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:11.229
Ask Mr. Natali to introduce us.

01:25:12.140 --> 01:25:13.107
Why not?

01:25:15.844 --> 01:25:18.506
They'll be represented
by two figures clad in white.

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:24.074
Black light will give the scene
a nightmarish quality.

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.346
The wind from time to time
will carry in the cry of the gulls.

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:28.945
As if shaken by a sudden shiver,
Frida turns.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:32.924
She looks tired, aged. She approaches him.
"There will be no moon tonight."

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.153
I like you, baby.

01:25:35.263 --> 01:25:37.731
And if you're not drinking with me,
damn you to hell!

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:43.268
- Can you do Gary Cooper?
- Alberto, do the saw.

01:25:43.471 --> 01:25:46.201
I do a good saw.
But you've got to close your eyes.

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:48.198
Be quiet and listen!

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.604
My turn to do an impression.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:56.250
My grandmother.
- Granny, I'll never leave you.

01:25:56.584 --> 01:26:00.281
Can't you do impressions?
Why are you so serious?

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:03.785
I like this dark-haired boy.
He's got class.

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.417
That's true.

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:11.694
"No, not even crime horrifies me now.
Yet I can remember..."

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:18.200
Hey, there's a radio here.
I'm gonna turn it on.

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:21.706
That's a naughty thing to say.

01:26:53.808 --> 01:26:55.241
Leopoldo, where are you going?

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:58.244
I'll tell you later.
I feel poetically inspired.

01:26:58.446 --> 01:27:00.505
An idea worthy of a genius!

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:04.541
An ocean breeze, a night wind.

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:08.952
- Sir, my friends...
- Your friends disappoint me.

01:27:10.425 --> 01:27:13.792
He who cares not for art
cares not for life.

01:27:14.429 --> 01:27:16.158
Is the beach that way?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.991
Excellent!

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:21.429
Let's use first names -
we're both artists, after all!

01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:23.962
Your Frida is wonderful.
She's marvelous.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:28.031
What a well-sculpted character.
Perfect for Ferrati!

01:27:28.376 --> 01:27:34.110
Excellent! I'll write to her tonight.
She'll be thrilled.

01:27:34.782 --> 01:27:38.718
If Act IV is anything like
the first two you read me,

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:43.420
I can tell you we have
a guaranteed success on our hands.

01:27:44.192 --> 01:27:46.558
What's your name?
- Poldo, sir.

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:50.097
Leopoldo, in two months
you must come with me to Milan.

01:27:50.198 --> 01:27:53.929
- Really, sir? Are you serious?
- Call me Sergio.

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:58.094
- Sir, are you serious?
- Come, Leopoldo. Let's read Act IV.

01:27:58.206 --> 01:28:01.141
Sir, you have no idea
what this means to me.

01:28:01.342 --> 01:28:04.641
I was ready to give up
on all my dreams.

01:28:05.079 --> 01:28:07.479
- Is the beach this way?
- This way, sir.

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:13.111
Sergio, I can hardly express...
This town is blind to art.

01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:15.189
It's so hard,
being perpetually misunderstood.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:18.088
My friends don't even understand me.
They only care about material things.

01:28:18.192 --> 01:28:20.717
They live their sordid lives,
thinking of women and money.

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:24.161
I feel so alone.
And the winter is awful.

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:27.857
It's endless in this town.
I'm so full of sadness and anguish.

01:28:28.069 --> 01:28:32.369
At midnight the town goes dark.
How can an artist feed his demons?

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.131
How can he live in this silence?

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:38.611
The years go by,
then one morning you wake up.

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.977
Just yesterday you were a boy,
and now you're no longer young.

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.606
My hat!

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:47.817
But that's all over now. In two months
I'll go to Milan, Genoa, anywhere.

01:28:48.456 --> 01:28:52.187
I knew I shouldn't give up.
I knew I'd find my way,

01:28:52.293 --> 01:28:54.523
that one day you'd come along.

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:59.389
Where are you?

01:29:08.843 --> 01:29:12.540
The wind has died down.
Is that the pier?

01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:15.246
Come and read me Act IV.

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:19.250
Sir - Sergio, where are you going?

01:29:19.454 --> 01:29:21.183
We'll find a spot down there.

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.692
But it's dark down there.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.356
Come.

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.102
Come.

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:42.272
You aren't afraid of me, are you?

01:29:48.316 --> 01:29:52.047
Poldo, where are you going?
I was joking.

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.283
What did you think I meant?
Come back here, Poldo.

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.010
Bye.

01:30:20.815 --> 01:30:22.373
Bye, baby.

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.708
Don't catch cold.

01:30:26.687 --> 01:30:29.520
I'll come to the station
in the morning to see you off.

01:30:42.136 --> 01:30:43.865
What are you doing here?

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:49.437
- I was waiting for you.
- Good for you. Thanks.

01:30:49.644 --> 01:30:51.839
I think it's better
if we go home together.

01:30:52.213 --> 01:30:53.441
Of course.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.809
Man, what a woman!

01:30:59.086 --> 01:31:02.613
You know what she told me?
If I could sing, she'd hire me.

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.723
Honest. She was going
to take me on tour.

01:31:05.893 --> 01:31:07.485
It's not a bad life.

01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:11.529
You travel, you're free,
you have fun, no worries.

01:31:12.467 --> 01:31:14.162
Always surrounded by women.

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:24.177
What about you?

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:26.936
What about me? Nothing.

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:29.578
Why not?
She really wasn't bad-looking.

01:31:30.952 --> 01:31:32.544
What's wrong with you?

01:31:35.056 --> 01:31:36.614
Nothing. I was just thinking.

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:38.691
About what?

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:40.387
Sandra.

01:31:41.596 --> 01:31:45.191
What's she got to do with this?
You gonna preach to me now?

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:48.292
Is that why you waited for me?

01:31:50.638 --> 01:31:51.935
Answer me.

01:31:57.445 --> 01:31:58.605
Good night.

01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:01.739
You've still got lipstick
on your face.

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.007
Other side.

01:32:32.813 --> 01:32:34.474
Sandra, aren't you asleep yet?

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:37.676
Look at that little face.
- Don't touch him!

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.417
Why not?

01:32:42.156 --> 01:32:44.181
Are you crying?
- Go away. Get out.

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:47.125
- What did I do?
- Go away.

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:48.627
Sandrina.

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.557
- Don't touch me.
- You'll wake the baby.

01:32:52.533 --> 01:32:54.228
Tell me what I did, at least.

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:41.913
<i>That morning, Sandra left the house</i>
<i>at dawn without a word to anyone...</i>

01:33:43.184 --> 01:33:45.744
<i>and at noon</i>
<i>she still hadn't come back.</i>

01:33:48.522 --> 01:33:50.422
Here comes Riccardo
with Papa's car.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.587
Hi, Riccardo. Hi, Alberto.
Get in, Fausto.

01:33:54.795 --> 01:33:55.523
Hi, Fausto.

01:33:56.263 --> 01:33:58.788
Moraldo went to see Miss Rossi,
Sandra's old teacher.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:00.594
She might have gone to see her.

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.464
That's right, Fausto.

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.629
I think she might be there.

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:08.133
Let's go to the school
and then to her nanny's.

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:11.205
How far to the nanny's?
What about the gas?

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.779
What happened?
Did you have a fight?

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:36.297
Well?

01:34:37.238 --> 01:34:39.035
She hasn't seen her.

01:34:41.642 --> 01:34:43.507
Get in.
Let's go to the nanny's.

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:47.012
You go ahead.
I'll look for her on my own.

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:51.215
What's happened to her?

01:34:51.318 --> 01:34:52.683
Nothing, miss.

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:56.017
Forget about him. Let's go.

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:11.498
Leopoldo, how about before
we leave town we grab a bite to eat?

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:14.504
We could grab a bite to eat
before we leave town.

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:15.939
Shut up!

01:35:16.777 --> 01:35:19.371
I think we'll find her at the nanny's.

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.606
I'm sure of it.

01:35:20.815 --> 01:35:22.715
She went to show her
the baby. You'll see.

01:35:22.917 --> 01:35:26.080
That's what I think.
She went to show her the baby.

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:31.086
Did you have anything to eat
before you left the house?

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:33.951
Nothing at all?
- I'm not hungry.

01:35:34.061 --> 01:35:35.926
- A sandwich, maybe...
- I'm not hungry.

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.871
- Where are we supposed to turn?
- Let's get out.

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:56.010
- Let's ask for directions.
- Ask who? There's nobody here.

01:35:56.684 --> 01:35:58.515
There's a house down there.

01:35:58.686 --> 01:36:02.087
There's no one there.
This is a wasteland.

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:06.959
Fausto, where are you going?

01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:11.689
- Watch Leopoldo.
- Go ahead, do it.

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:18.066
- Hey, you could have hit me.
- Don't look at me. It was him.

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:21.566
Quiet.
Did you hear the pipit?

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:23.838
- What?
- The pipit.

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:25.375
That's no pipit.
That's a robin.

01:36:25.579 --> 01:36:28.241
That's no robin.
Robins sound like this...

01:36:31.218 --> 01:36:33.049
How do robins sound?

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:35.085
Robins sound like this...

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:56.508
<i>But Sandra wasn't at the nanny's either.</i>
<i>Fausto was getting scared.</i>

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.473
- What happened?
- Riccardo.

01:36:59.947 --> 01:37:02.438
We have to go back right away.
- The car won't start.

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.948
We'll have to take
the carburetor apart.

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:10.019
- May I borrow that bicycle?
- Of course, dear boy.

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.920
It belongs to Cesare,
but he won't need it today. Be careful.

01:37:13.027 --> 01:37:15.222
Would you like something to eat?
An omelet with bacon, maybe.

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:17.126
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Get out of my way.

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.596
Listen, Fausto.
Sandra is at home. I'm sure of it.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:22.168
I'll bet you anything
that she's at home.

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:24.669
- Cut it out. Out of my way.
- Now you feel guilty?

01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:27.240
It took you long enough.
- Out of my way, idiot!

01:37:27.341 --> 01:37:29.502
Worry about that sister of yours
who never came back!

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:32.636
Dirty rotten coward!
Lecher!

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.244
- You mentioned an omelet?
- Yes.

01:37:40.454 --> 01:37:43.480
- With bacon. Albertone.
- Leave me alone.

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:46.159
- With bacon.
- With bacon?

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:12.946
- Isn't anybody home?
- They're at the police station.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:15.314
They're looking for her
at the beach.

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:17.785
At the beach?

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:21.223
Why would they do that?

01:38:21.428 --> 01:38:23.293
I don't know.

01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:31.604
What should I do?
Should I start making lunch?

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:41.805
It's you.

01:38:43.050 --> 01:38:45.416
See? We meet again.

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.444
It's fate.

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:50.753
What's the matter?
Why haven't you shaved?

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:54.052
Where are you going
in such a hurry? The movies?

01:38:54.261 --> 01:38:56.320
I'm going home.

01:38:57.031 --> 01:39:00.194
Would you be a gentleman
and carry this for me?

01:39:00.401 --> 01:39:03.495
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I really can't.

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:38.935
Is she back?

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:45.601
If she doesn't come back,
I'll kill myself!

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:50.208
You'll never kill yourself.
You're a coward.

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:56.485
Moraldo, listen.

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.213
Mr. Michele.

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.157
What's the matter?

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.722
Sandrina has disappeared.

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:48.273
Hey, workers.

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:54.678
Stupid workers!

01:40:57.951 --> 01:41:00.886
- What's up with this car?
- Hey, why are you stopping?

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:04.549
- Get out. Open the hood.
- What do you want me to do?

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:08.484
Let me out.

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:10.492
Look at him. He's asleep.
- Hurry up.

01:41:14.368 --> 01:41:16.233
They're coming.

01:41:16.503 --> 01:41:18.232
Hey, we were only joking!

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:24.608
What's going on?

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:29.616
What did I do? I was asleep.

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:31.308
I'm a socialist.
- Socialist?

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.318
You're not even a man!

01:41:44.098 --> 01:41:46.191
- Are you looking for Sandra?
- Yes.

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:49.061
She's been here with us all day.

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.748
Hold it right there.

01:42:06.019 --> 01:42:08.852
Sandra, take the baby
in the other room.

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:12.287
- Papa, it's all right.
- Please, go in the other room.

01:42:16.897 --> 01:42:21.095
You too, Mirella.
- Please, Papa, let me stay.

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:25.266
What a day, Papa.

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:38.614
Papa, what are you doing?

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:41.849
- You hear that?
- No, I can't hear a thing.

01:42:41.955 --> 01:42:43.684
He's beating him!
Let me go in there!

01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:45.815
They're just arguing.
A little loudly, but they're men.

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:47.618
He's hurting him.

01:42:47.728 --> 01:42:48.922
Please, Papa!

01:42:49.796 --> 01:42:51.286
Leave them alone.
They're just playing.

01:42:52.432 --> 01:42:55.731
No, Papa, no!

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.566
Let me go in there.
Can't you hear them yelling?

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:02.540
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
- Mirellina, he'll kill him.

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:10.648
- He's beating him to a pulp.
- I don't think he's hurting him.

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:13.319
On the contrary...

01:43:15.222 --> 01:43:18.020
Please hold the baby.
I have to go in there.

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.418
Papa, enough!

01:43:41.381 --> 01:43:44.373
Allow me to shake your hand.
Michele Corti's the name.

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:47.076
It's an honor.

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:51.155
- You really gave me a scare.
- Did he hurt you, darling?

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:53.658
No. How are you?

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:06.862
Good night, Papa.

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:23.619
You scared me so, Sandra.
Never do that again, you hear?

01:44:24.191 --> 01:44:27.991
And if you make me mad again,
I'll beat you like your father.

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:29.961
But even harder.

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:32.861
I'll beat you senseless.

01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:35.425
That's how I like you!

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.038
Let me hold the baby.

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:44.772
- Don't let him catch cold.
- Look, Mirellina is at the window.

01:44:45.078 --> 01:44:46.670
Bye, Mirella.

01:44:54.187 --> 01:44:57.486
<i>Fausto and Sandra's story</i>
<i>ends here for now.</i>

01:44:58.592 --> 01:45:01.493
<i>As for Leopoldo,</i>
<i>Alberto, Riccardo</i>

01:45:01.695 --> 01:45:05.563
<i>and the rest of us,</i>
<i>you can imagine what happened.</i>

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:08.735
<i>We all talked about leaving,</i>

01:45:09.236 --> 01:45:13.502
<i>but only one of us, one morning,</i>
<i>without a word to a soul,</i>

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.340
<i>actually left.</i>

01:45:55.215 --> 01:45:57.683
- Are you leaving?
- Guido.

01:45:58.151 --> 01:46:00.346
- Yes, I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:04.182
I don't know. I'm leaving.

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.384
All aboard.

01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:08.291
All clear.

01:46:11.431 --> 01:46:14.195
- Why are you leaving then?
- I don't know.

01:46:14.401 --> 01:46:15.993
I have to go away. I'm leaving.

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:18.162
Didn't you like it here?

01:46:21.041 --> 01:46:24.033
Good-bye, Moraldo.

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:27.837
Good-bye, Guido.
