WEBVTT

01:57.159 --> 02:01.789
Electricity.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.703
Where am I?

02:54.216 --> 02:55.509
Just a second.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.474
Dougie!

03:02.600 --> 03:03.934
Dad?

03:04.059 --> 03:06.353
Dad? Dad!

03:09.398 --> 03:10.774
Home.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.340
Huh?

08:58.789 --> 08:59.790
Is it you?

09:02.668 --> 09:03.752
Is it really you?

09:07.881 --> 09:08.840
Yes.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.385
It's really me, Diane.

09:21.103 --> 09:22.145
Is it really you?

09:24.648 --> 09:25.732
Yes.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.263
You sure you want to do this?

10:54.988 --> 10:56.990
You don't know what
it's gonna be like once we‒

10:57.115 --> 10:58.200
I know that.

11:00.369 --> 11:01.745
We're at that point now.

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331
I can feel it.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.509
Look.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.513
Almost exactly 430 miles.

11:42.828 --> 11:45.372
Exactly 430 miles.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.134
Just think about it, Cooper.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.963
This is the place, all right.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.302
Kiss me.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.976
Once we cross,
it could all be different.

13:57.712 --> 13:58.547
Let's go.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.124
Turn off the light.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.133
What do we do now?

18:55.969 --> 18:57.345
You come over here to me.

19:13.945 --> 19:14.946
Diane.

"Dear Richard..."

24:11.868 --> 24:12.743
Richard?

24:14.745 --> 24:16.789
"When you read this,
I'll be gone.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.709
Please don't try to find me.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.794
I don't recognize you anymore.

24:23.004 --> 24:26.215
Whatever it was
we had together is over.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.676
Linda."

24:35.308 --> 24:37.018
Richard.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.144
Linda.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.048
Coffee?

27:15.134 --> 27:16.844
- More coffee?
- Yes.

27:52.296 --> 27:53.297
Coffee?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.848
Is there another waitress
that works here?

28:08.062 --> 28:09.063
Yeah.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.027
It's her day off.

28:17.238 --> 28:18.781
Actually,
it's her third day off.

28:23.869 --> 28:24.870
More coffee?

28:30.793 --> 28:32.169
Stop it.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.754
Stop it!

28:33.879 --> 28:35.589
Stop. Stop!

28:36.215 --> 28:37.049
Leave her alone.

28:51.772 --> 28:53.315
What the fuck you doing?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.359
What?

28:57.737 --> 28:59.905
Get the fuck out of that booth.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.660
Oh, fuck!

29:05.161 --> 29:06.328
Oh, shit!

29:08.080 --> 29:09.123
Oh.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.041
Oh, shit.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.504
Put your gun on the ground.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.673
I don't have a gun.

29:17.798 --> 29:20.760
Put your gun on the ground.

29:32.313 --> 29:33.147
Sit down.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.196
Oh, shit.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.784
Motherfucker.

29:47.286 --> 29:48.120
Shit.

29:51.499 --> 29:52.416
Fuck.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.544
Shit.

29:55.669 --> 29:57.129
Who is he?

30:17.733 --> 30:19.860
Write the address
on a piece of paper.

30:21.862 --> 30:22.696
What?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.868
Write the address
of the other waitress

30:27.993 --> 30:29.703
on a piece of paper.

30:52.309 --> 30:53.769
Where does this go?

30:53.894 --> 30:55.104
What?

30:55.229 --> 30:56.647
Where do you hang this?

30:57.648 --> 30:58.816
Above, in the slot.

31:30.180 --> 31:32.933
I don't know if the oil's hot enough
to set off those bullets,

31:33.058 --> 31:34.226
but I'd move away.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.404
Did you write down
her address for me?

31:47.740 --> 31:49.658
Yeah, but, um...

31:49.783 --> 31:51.243
It's okay.

31:51.368 --> 31:53.662
I'm with the FBI.

31:53.787 --> 31:54.872
FBI?

32:20.981 --> 32:23.275
What the fuck just happened?

34:08.547 --> 34:09.548
Who is it?

34:12.760 --> 34:13.761
FBI.

34:16.430 --> 34:17.723
Did you find him?

34:19.391 --> 34:20.684
Laura.

34:22.019 --> 34:23.312
You didn't find him?

34:24.396 --> 34:25.397
Laura.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.943
You got
the wrong house, mister.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.239
You're saying
you're not Laura Palmer?

34:35.741 --> 34:36.825
Laura who?

34:36.950 --> 34:39.578
No, I'm not her.

34:39.703 --> 34:40.788
Now‒

34:40.913 --> 34:41.747
What's your name?

34:46.376 --> 34:47.461
Carrie Page.

34:49.254 --> 34:50.380
Carrie Page?

34:51.173 --> 34:52.549
That's right.

34:52.674 --> 34:54.134
Now, I got to go, so...

34:54.259 --> 34:55.094
Wait.

34:57.513 --> 35:00.015
So the name Laura Palmer
means nothing to you?

35:03.227 --> 35:04.269
Look...

35:05.604 --> 35:08.816
...I don't know what you want,

35:08.941 --> 35:10.192
but I'm not her.

35:12.569 --> 35:14.488
Your father's name
was Leland.

35:17.282 --> 35:18.325
Okay.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.245
Your mother's name
is Sarah.

35:27.417 --> 35:28.627
S-Sarah?

35:29.753 --> 35:31.964
Yes, Sarah.

35:38.303 --> 35:40.305
What's going on?

35:41.557 --> 35:43.809
It's difficult to explain.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.811
As strange as it sounds,

35:45.936 --> 35:48.605
I think you're a girl
named Laura Palmer.

35:51.650 --> 35:55.237
I want to take you
to your mother's home...

35:55.362 --> 35:57.614
your home at one time.

35:59.408 --> 36:01.326
It's very important.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.084
Um...

36:12.796 --> 36:13.922
...listen.

36:16.550 --> 36:18.051
Normally...

36:19.386 --> 36:23.140
...somebody like you comes around,

36:23.265 --> 36:25.309
and I tell him to fuck off.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.147
This door would be slammed
in their face.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.652
Right now...

36:35.777 --> 36:37.696
I got to get
out of Dodge anyway.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.490
It's a long story.

36:42.576 --> 36:46.205
So riding with the FBI
just might save my ass.

36:51.627 --> 36:53.212
Where we going?

36:54.004 --> 36:55.839
Twin Peaks, Washington.

36:58.342 --> 36:59.801
D.C.?

36:59.927 --> 37:01.845
No, state.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.180
Washington State.

37:04.640 --> 37:05.974
It's a long way?

37:06.099 --> 37:07.392
It's a ways away.

37:10.270 --> 37:12.231
Let me get my things.
Come on in.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.867
Give me a minute.

38:08.704 --> 38:09.871
Washington.

38:09.997 --> 38:11.415
Is that, like, up north?

38:11.540 --> 38:13.000
Do I need a coat?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.543
Take a coat if you've got one.

38:14.668 --> 38:17.170
I've got a couple.

38:17.296 --> 38:18.297
I'll grab one.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.931
Listen...

38:28.056 --> 38:29.641
I don't have any food here.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.603
I'll get us some food
on the way.

38:34.813 --> 38:35.939
All right.

38:37.482 --> 38:38.317
Let's go.

38:55.208 --> 38:57.586
Are you really an FBI agent?

39:02.924 --> 39:03.759
Yes.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.934
Well, at least we're getting
out of this fucking town of Odessa.

41:12.179 --> 41:14.097
Is someone following us?

42:36.846 --> 42:38.223
Odessa.

42:42.769 --> 42:45.272
I tried to keep
a clean house...

42:48.817 --> 42:51.236
...keep everything organized.

43:11.047 --> 43:12.674
It's a long way.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.621
In those days...

43:44.956 --> 43:47.959
...I was too young
to know any better.

47:15.500 --> 47:17.126
You recognize anything?

47:30.598 --> 47:31.599
No.

47:55.498 --> 47:57.083
You recognize that house?

48:10.847 --> 48:12.223
No.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.137
Come on.

50:27.108 --> 50:28.526
Yes?

50:31.237 --> 50:32.321
FBI.

50:34.032 --> 50:36.325
I'm Special Agent Dale Cooper.

50:36.451 --> 50:38.119
Is Sarah Palmer here?

50:39.328 --> 50:40.204
Who?

50:43.124 --> 50:44.250
Sarah Palmer.

50:46.044 --> 50:48.004
No, there's no one here
by that name.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.844
Do you know Sarah Palmer?

50:55.928 --> 50:56.763
No.

51:01.309 --> 51:02.852
Is this your house?

51:02.977 --> 51:04.520
Do you own this house,

51:04.645 --> 51:06.731
or do you rent this house?

51:07.565 --> 51:09.567
Yes, we own this house.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.740
Who did you buy it from?

51:20.411 --> 51:23.623
Honey, what was the name
of the woman who sold us the house?

51:30.129 --> 51:32.173
Chalfont, a Mrs. Chalfont.

51:41.140 --> 51:43.976
Do you happen to know
who she bought it from?

51:46.896 --> 51:48.564
No, I don't, but...

51:49.816 --> 51:53.194
Honey, do you know who owned it
before Mrs. Chalfont?

51:58.825 --> 51:59.659
No.

52:07.458 --> 52:08.626
What is your name?

52:10.545 --> 52:12.463
Alice. Alice Tremond.

52:15.967 --> 52:16.801
Okay.

52:20.763 --> 52:23.141
Sorry to bother you
so late at night.

52:25.017 --> 52:26.519
That's okay.

52:28.437 --> 52:29.355
Good night.

52:29.480 --> 52:30.606
Good night.

54:02.073 --> 54:03.407
What year is this?

54:23.803 --> 54:25.930
Laura!
