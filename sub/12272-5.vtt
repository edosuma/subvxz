00:22.800 --> 00:23.900
Cut!

00:24.700 --> 00:26.200
Cut! Damn it!

00:26.300 --> 00:28.800
Can somebody please
get her a glass of water?!

00:29.200 --> 00:31.300
What happened? Babe?

00:31.700 --> 00:33.500
What are you doing?
Are you choking on the blood?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.600
I did what you
told me to.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.800
Yeah, but this time, get it on her face,
not in her mouth.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.000
The mouth is part
of the face.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.200
Yeah, I know, I know.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.800
But hit her from
the side, from the side.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.300
And get plenty on the rack.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.100
We're dying here.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.500
I'm going to go ring it.

00:47.500 --> 00:49.500
All right. Hey,
grab me a bear claw.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.100
How long have I known you, huh?

00:51.400 --> 00:52.600
This is you and me.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.200
Get the shot--
Not too tight.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.000
Wide enough to fit
in the fun bags.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.200
Baby-cakes...

00:58.200 --> 00:59.800
Where was i?
Want me to laugh?

00:59.800 --> 01:01.600
Don't laugh.
You were scary. Get away.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.400
Honey, this time,
don't inhale the blood, okay?

01:05.099 --> 01:06.700
All right, let's
get her cleaned up.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.400
- LET'S SHOOT THIS BITCH.
- OH...

01:08.600 --> 01:11.200
Not you, baby. The shot.
The shot's a bitch.

01:11.300 --> 01:12.700
I love one-ers.

01:12.800 --> 01:14.800
And you know what else I love?
I love sushi.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.800
Do you want to go for sushi?

01:15.800 --> 01:17.200
Our lead actress,
weatherly adams,

01:17.200 --> 01:19.800
had her dressing room
violated last night.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.900
So she's the one you
suspect is missing?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.200
She missed her call
this morning.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.100
The woman is nothing
if not professional.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.500
She's predictably
precisely 35 minutes late every day.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.700
You could set
your watch to it.

01:29.700 --> 01:32.500
She's already... Three hours late
and still no sign.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.500
Okay.

01:34.900 --> 01:36.000
Nothing to worry
about, gentlemen.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.200
It's just a bad bulb.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.200
If you will, please,
follow me.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.200
Here we are.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.500
Check out the flowers
in the vase.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.700
"congratulations
on your last film."

02:00.100 --> 02:02.600
any idea who sent her these,
mr. Vespucci?

02:02.900 --> 02:04.200
Stalkers, creeps,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
cranks, nut balls, degenerates--

02:06.700 --> 02:07.800
We get them
all here.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.100
Weatherly attracts
them like flies.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.600
These are, uh,

02:11.600 --> 02:13.800
some of the guys we've had
trouble with in the past.

02:14.000 --> 02:14.900
I'll take that.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.200
When was the last
time you saw her?

02:18.300 --> 02:19.300
At wrap yesterday.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.500
We shot all night, finished
about 4:00 in the morning.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.700
Did anyone see her
leave the building?

02:24.700 --> 02:26.400
Her car's still
parked out back.

02:27.200 --> 02:27.800
This hers?

02:27.800 --> 02:29.700
- HI, IT'S WEATHERLY.
- YEAH.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.100
Leave a message or i'll scream.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.600
Wallet, keys, and cell phone
still in there.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.300
Still no answer
on her home phone.

02:37.300 --> 02:38.600
I'll send a patrol car
to her house.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.600
You said there was a break in,
why don't you show me?

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
Ah, weatherly...

02:46.000 --> 02:48.700
How has she died for us,
let me count the ways.

02:50.000 --> 02:53.900
Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted,

02:54.700 --> 02:57.400
defenestrated,
decapitated,

02:58.300 --> 02:59.300
disemboweled,

02:59.900 --> 03:02.500
oh, yeah, and strangled
with her own intestines.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.500
Autopsied while
still alive.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.500
Made to eat her own liver,

03:07.800 --> 03:10.000
fed slowly through
a tree chipper,

03:10.500 --> 03:13.700
roasted and served on
a bed of belgian endive.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.200
When weatherly adams dies,
it's money in the bank.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.200
Here you are, gentlemen.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.800
Looks like somebody
broke the glass,

03:23.800 --> 03:26.000
reached in, unlocked it

03:26.100 --> 03:27.100
and opened it.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.700
Yeah, that's the way
i found it

03:28.700 --> 03:29.900
when I got here
this evening.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.300
Uh, jim...

03:54.100 --> 03:55.100
I got her.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.100
And I believe she's died
for the last time.

"i have to axe my mother"

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
whoever stuck around this poster

04:43.800 --> 04:46.500
was trying to send
a twisted message.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.500
Either that, or the killer's
got a wicked sense of humor.

04:53.900 --> 04:59.200
Lividity is fixed along
the anterior aspect, and...

04:59.200 --> 05:01.300
She is still
in full rigor.

05:02.300 --> 05:05.200
She was last seen alive
about 15 hours ago.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.900
No panties.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.700
I'll do an s.A.E. Kit.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.500
"the horror."

05:14.600 --> 05:16.100
the horror...

05:16.900 --> 05:17.900
Huh?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.000
Bra-brando?

05:20.500 --> 05:21.800
Brando from
apocalypse now?

05:21.800 --> 05:23.500
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I know, dave.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.600
Everybody knows that.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.100
Oh.
I'll get the gurney.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.100
Looks like the lady lost a heel.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.200
There's a whole lot
of something here,

05:39.200 --> 05:41.900
but it doesn't really
look like blood to me.

05:42.900 --> 05:44.900
No, it's, uh,
it's the wrong color.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.600
It's too red.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
Smells sweet.

05:52.100 --> 05:54.600
Karo syrup and food
coloring-- it's prop blood.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.200
And I am not seeing any prints.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.800
It's been wiped clean.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.100
The question is, where does
the fake blood end

06:01.100 --> 06:02.900
and the real blood begin?

06:09.200 --> 06:12.400
Now, I know this may come
as a shock to most of you,

06:12.900 --> 06:14.600
and i'm sorry
for your loss.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.400
I understand that weatherly
adams was a long-time member

06:17.400 --> 06:20.000
- OF THIS COMPANY...
- WELL, DO YOU HAVE A SUSPECT?

06:20.600 --> 06:23.700
uh, sir, we just found
the body about an hour ago.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.400
We're just beginning
our investigation.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.500
Yeah, I get it, I get it.
I mean, it could be anyone.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.000
Now, i'm going
to have to look at your ids

06:30.000 --> 06:31.200
and i'm going
to take statements

06:31.200 --> 06:33.300
and fingerprints
from all of you.

06:33.800 --> 06:36.400
And I thank you in advance
for your cooperation.

06:36.400 --> 06:37.900
Anything we can do to help.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.800
- SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO TODAY?
- EDIT.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.600
Excuse me, mr. Brass.

06:43.700 --> 06:47.100
Do you think that it
would be all right

06:47.100 --> 06:49.300
if we were to...
Continue to shoot...

06:49.300 --> 06:49.800
No.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.300
I want that little twerp zarco
found and locked up.

06:52.300 --> 06:53.400
Uh, who are you?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.500
Vincent lafoon.
This is my brother mason.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.200
We own this place.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.200
Who's zarco?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.900
Oliver zarco.
He used to work here.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.200
He had a thing for weatherly,

07:00.300 --> 07:03.700
and then he got hurt, blamed it
on us, went a little nuts.

07:03.700 --> 07:04.700
He was the one who got...

07:04.700 --> 07:07.100
He was the one who sent
the flowers and the note.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.300
So he's done this before.

07:08.300 --> 07:10.300
- YEAH, LIKE, THREE TIMES.
- WOULD YOU SHUT IT?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.900
Three times. He's your guy.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.200
Do you have video
surveillance by any chance?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.800
Yeah, only on the exterior,

07:16.800 --> 07:18.500
but the video system's
been on the fritz lately.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.800
I had it repaired three days
ago-- i'll get the tapes.

07:20.800 --> 07:21.700
Oh, good.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.400
Look, just find zarco, okay?

07:25.900 --> 07:27.000
Everyone,
come together.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.400
Um, I can't, I still can't
believe she's gone.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.300
I mean... She was a...
She was a real beautiful lady.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.300
Let's form a circle

07:35.300 --> 07:38.200
and touch hands with
someone you care about.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.400
Yea, though I walk
through the valley

07:42.400 --> 07:44.300
of the shadow of death,

07:44.500 --> 07:47.900
i will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.000
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me...

08:56.500 --> 08:57.600
How's it going in here?

08:58.100 --> 08:59.100
The vase is clean.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.100
I've got a
spiral notebook

09:01.100 --> 09:03.300
filled with dates,
times and weights.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.600
Looks like she was a bit
concerned about her size.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.300
Actors.

09:11.900 --> 09:13.700
You really don't
recognize her?

09:13.700 --> 09:14.700
No.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.700
You've ever seen
chop chop, fizz fizz?

09:16.700 --> 09:17.700
No.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.900
- CAN I LICK THE SPOON?
- PLEASE, DAVID.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.300
They're classics.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.100
Those are not classics.

09:25.500 --> 09:27.400
The exorcist.
The shining.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.700
Rosema's baby.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.500
Those are classics.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.300
You know what
i loved about her?

09:33.000 --> 09:35.500
She really made you
feel the terror.

09:35.800 --> 09:39.500
When she was scared
for her life, I was scared, too.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.300
Interesting.

09:49.400 --> 09:50.500
Mr. Zarco...

09:52.400 --> 09:54.500
Tell me about you
and weatherly adams.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.400
It was the happiest time
in my life.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.000
I had realized my dream.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.100
I was working in the movies.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.800
Though I was only in
an entry-level position,

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
weatherly and I were
already an item.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.100
Just like...

10:10.200 --> 10:12.300
Julia roberts
and what's his name.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.500
We were in love.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.600
Hi

10:22.000 --> 10:24.200
and then it was
all over in an instant.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.400
Oh, god!

10:27.400 --> 10:29.100
Oh, my god!

10:31.800 --> 10:33.800
I was in rehab for six months.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.200
That slime ball lafoon
convinced me

10:37.200 --> 10:40.000
not to file
a worker's compensation claim.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.200
He said that
he'd take care of me.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.500
And you trusted him?

10:44.500 --> 10:48.000
Yes. And then, when the deadline
passed to file my claim,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.800
vincent offered me two grand,

10:49.800 --> 10:53.300
take it or leave it,
and then he fired my ass.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.500
And I could have lived
with that, but...

10:57.200 --> 10:58.400
But what?

11:01.000 --> 11:02.100
Weatherly...

11:04.200 --> 11:05.300
Dumped me.

11:06.800 --> 11:07.800
She felt we
were no longer

11:07.800 --> 11:09.000
compatible.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.200
The truth was, she couldn't
stand to look at me.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.300
She cried when she told me.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.100
Actresses
can do that.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.400
The smell of her skin...

11:23.600 --> 11:27.600
Like fresh lemon poppy seed
scones baking in the oven.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.100
Gold flecks that
danced like valkyries

11:31.100 --> 11:33.400
in the emerald
depths of her eyes.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.900
Her hair-- oh, god...

11:36.200 --> 11:37.000
Her hair...

11:37.300 --> 11:39.300
So you started stalking her.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.300
I brought her gifts
from time to time,

11:42.300 --> 11:44.400
to let her know
that I still loved her.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.500
Is that against the law?

11:46.600 --> 11:48.700
It is if you break in to do it.

11:48.700 --> 11:50.300
They wouldn't let me
in the front door.

11:50.300 --> 11:52.100
So you came in
through the window.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.200
Only this time,
you got caught.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.400
You argued. She told you where
to shove your flowers,

11:57.400 --> 11:58.500
and you thought to yourself,

11:58.700 --> 12:01.600
"you know, do I really need this
aggravation?"

12:02.000 --> 12:03.600
so you killed the bitch.

12:04.400 --> 12:06.000
I think you killed the bitch.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.400
Why would I kill her?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.200
How should I know?
Do I know you?

12:09.200 --> 12:12.100
Listen, zarco,
you whack job, you'd better focus!

12:12.100 --> 12:14.200
You focus.
I'm trying to explain to you.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.300
I haven't been near that place
in over a year.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.600
You got the wrong guy.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.500
I don't do that anymore.
I'm in therapy now.

12:19.500 --> 12:20.600
Lots of therapy.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.900
Freudian, jungian, gestaltian--
All that crap.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.500
I've let go of my anger.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.100
Have you seen
catherine around?

12:31.500 --> 12:32.600
No, why?

12:32.600 --> 12:33.900
'CAUSE I JUST GOT
The dna results

12:33.900 --> 12:35.700
for weatherly adams, and
the skin under her nails

12:35.700 --> 12:37.500
and the semen from her
s.A.E., they both belong

12:37.500 --> 12:39.900
- TO VAUGHN KRUNTY.
- WHO?

12:39.900 --> 12:42.400
vaughn krunty,
aka "zack putrid."

12:43.700 --> 12:44.400
who's that?

12:44.400 --> 12:46.800
The titan of terror,
the sultan of slash.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.700
He's the movie director.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.300
I just... I found him in codis
for a statutory rape charge

12:50.300 --> 12:51.400
in laughlin when he was 18

12:51.400 --> 12:53.500
and the girl was 16.
Can you believe that?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.200
What's the matter
with you?

12:56.400 --> 12:57.300
Nothing.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.900
Go tell catherine what you
found, make sure that you pull

13:00.900 --> 13:03.300
all the old evidence out of
storage in case she needs it.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.600
Okay.

13:17.300 --> 13:18.000
Please.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.900
That looks pretty
stupid, doesn't it?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.900
Well, you could cut out earlier,
maybe go to

13:21.900 --> 13:25.100
a wide exterior shot, you
could carry the scream over

13:25.100 --> 13:27.900
a big flock of birds taking off.

13:29.000 --> 13:29.900
Yeah?

13:30.700 --> 13:31.700
Or... Yeah...

13:31.900 --> 13:34.000
Or not.
Or not, just...

13:34.300 --> 13:37.200
Bad idea.
All right, okay.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.500
Detective brass.

13:41.700 --> 13:43.000
Man, I love that.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.700
Detective brass.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.100
You're a detective,
and your name is brass.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.200
I can use that.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.700
That's like a cop
named officer copper.

13:50.700 --> 13:54.100
Or a tin horn sheriff named
sheriff tin.

13:54.700 --> 13:57.000
- YOU CANNOT WRITE THAT STUFF.
- LISTEN, BUDDY...

13:57.100 --> 13:58.700
Dude, I know
why you're here, okay?

13:58.700 --> 14:01.300
Weatherly and i, yes,
we were knocking boots, man.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.400
So, you acknowledge
having sex with her?

14:03.600 --> 14:05.800
Well, yeah, I just
said I had sex...

14:05.800 --> 14:07.400
Why would I deny it?

14:07.700 --> 14:09.600
Hey, I bang all
my stars.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.600
It builds trust.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.400
It's part of my process.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.200
We found traces of your skin
under her fingernails.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.000
Maybe she wasn't into your
"process, " so you raped her.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.800
You find that funny?

14:23.100 --> 14:24.600
Dude, you gotta see this.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.800
You're gonna love it.
Bring up double d.

14:26.800 --> 14:27.600
Yeah.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.400
Here goes.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.700
Hi, baby. Hi.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.100
Check it out.

14:33.700 --> 14:36.300
Money. Money.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.600
Oh, yeah.

14:38.900 --> 14:39.600
You're a star, baby.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.300
I can't believe this is my life.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.100
Oh, man, oh, man...

14:43.800 --> 14:45.300
Come over here, baby.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.600
Okay.

14:51.200 --> 14:52.600
This what you do all day?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.200
Does that look like a woman
being taken against her will?

14:55.200 --> 14:56.200
That still doesn't explain

14:56.200 --> 14:58.500
how your skin got under
her fingernails.

14:59.100 --> 15:00.200
Weatherly was...

15:01.100 --> 15:02.600
How can I put this
delicately?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.600
She was an ass-scratcher, man.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.800
She liked to
scratch my ass.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.500
She wasn't pushing me away, man,
she was pulling me in.

15:12.200 --> 15:14.000
Brass, look at my ass.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.800
Freaking claw marks.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.300
Are you trying to make me
throw up, mr. Putrid?

16:12.100 --> 16:13.700
Oh, my god.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.500
No way.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.900
That is so cool.
I can't believe you worked

16:17.900 --> 16:19.000
for repulsion pictures.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.300
Well, I did it on a whim.
I was supposed to be an extra,

16:21.300 --> 16:23.800
but then they liked me, so they
gave me this whole featured bit.

16:23.800 --> 16:27.000
I got 600 bucks for that.
What?

16:27.200 --> 16:28.400
What?
I was fresh out of college.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.700
I really needed the money.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.500
I don't get it--
What's the thrill here?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.500
It's always hot babes
with huge breasts

16:33.500 --> 16:35.300
falling out of their
shirts, getting hacked up...

16:35.300 --> 16:39.400
I don't have huge breasts.
Mine are kind of... Medium.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.600
But perfect...

16:42.400 --> 16:44.200
...LY ADEQUATE.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.200
Better, in fact.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.100
Okay.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.100
Uh, i'm out of here.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.200
Hey, let's watch it again.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.300
When I removed the axe,
i noticed that the dermis

16:55.400 --> 16:58.800
along the margin of the wound
showed no vital response,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.500
except in a small area

17:00.700 --> 17:02.700
on both sides of the center
of the track.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.300
The cause of death
was perforation

17:05.300 --> 17:09.000
of the liver,
spleen, and pancreas.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.300
But the injuries
are inconsistent

17:11.300 --> 17:13.200
with the position
of the axe wound.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.500
The axe isn't what killed her.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.400
Exactly. The perforation
was caused

17:17.400 --> 17:20.500
by a sharp, hollow,
cylindrical object

17:20.500 --> 17:21.900
entering through
the lower back,

17:22.099 --> 17:24.300
and then passing upwards
into the organs.

17:24.700 --> 17:27.200
Like a spear,
or a pipe of some kind?

17:27.200 --> 17:28.400
Perhaps.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.400
If the axe was planted
in her back postmortem

17:31.400 --> 17:34.300
to conceal the original
puncture site, then...

17:34.400 --> 17:35.600
We don't have a murder weapon.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
The only thing I found on the
surveillance tapes was this.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.000
That guy looks familiar.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.800
Oh, that's vincent lafoon.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.400
He and his brother
own the place.

17:48.500 --> 17:52.000
Well, here's
where it gets a little weird.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.100
He's trying to make it
look like somebody broke in.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.900
I think he's framing zarco.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
If he owns the place,

18:00.000 --> 18:01.800
he must have known about
the surveillance cameras.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.700
All right? Why would he let
himself get caught on tape?

18:05.500 --> 18:06.600
I don't know,
but according

18:06.600 --> 18:09.300
to brass' notes, he thought
the system was down.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.300
-

18:10.300 --> 18:12.200
So, we found
no physical evidence

18:12.200 --> 18:13.800
linking zarco to the scene.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.800
Vincent knew
he had an easy fall guy.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.500
He's been playing us
the whole time.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.600
Hey, you're making a big mistake;
you got the wrong dude.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.800
Yeah, a lot of guys
tell me that.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.100
But I didn't do anything.
Why would I kill weatherly?

18:32.100 --> 18:34.500
She was my company's best asset.
Plus, I liked her.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.600
She was my friend.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.700
That's him.
That's zarco.
That's your guy.

18:39.800 --> 18:41.000
What happened, lafoon?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.600
She get too old, so you
killed her for real?

18:45.600 --> 18:46.400
Where's he going?

18:46.600 --> 18:48.200
I don't know. Probably
out for a nice dinner.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.500
You're letting him go?

18:49.800 --> 18:50.500
Are you out of your mind?

18:50.500 --> 18:51.700
We've got nothing
on him.

18:51.700 --> 18:54.000
But i'm the one
getting set up here, me!

18:54.000 --> 18:56.600
Don't let him go-- i'm telling you --
You'll regret this.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.300
I never touched her.
You know it,

18:58.300 --> 18:59.600
i know it,
and they know it.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.900
You killed her,
and you're going down.

19:07.700 --> 19:08.600
Can I go now?

19:08.600 --> 19:11.000
Yeah, get out of here while i'm
still in a good mood.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.300
So long, lafoon.

19:12.500 --> 19:14.300
I hope they tear
you a big one.

19:24.700 --> 19:25.600
What's up?

19:31.700 --> 19:34.500
You know, in the slasher movies,
when they go after

19:34.500 --> 19:36.900
the dark-haired girl,
she always dies?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.500
Yeah. And the blond
always lives.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
Aren't you glad it
wasn't a movie?

19:52.500 --> 19:53.800
I think, um...

19:56.100 --> 20:00.000
I think I am sick of having my
face shoved in death every day.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.100
The murder rate has gone up every year
since i've been here.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.000
It's totally
out of control, and...

20:08.400 --> 20:10.600
We're not even
slowing them down.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.800
After examining the crime scene,
i determined there were between

20:14.800 --> 20:17.600
200 AND 300 MILLILITERS--
that's less than a cup--

20:17.600 --> 20:20.300
Of weatherly's actual
blood outside of her body.

20:20.300 --> 20:23.700
Originally, we had assumed that the axe
blade had sealed the wound,

20:23.700 --> 20:26.600
that the position of her body had caused her
to bleed internally.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.500
But if she had been gored first
by another weapon

20:28.500 --> 20:31.100
and then axed, there would have
been a lot more blood.

20:31.500 --> 20:34.000
Right, right. So, I compared
the initial coroner's report

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
with the last entry
in her weight loss journal--

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Which was taken no more than
an hour or two before her death.

20:39.000 --> 20:39.800
And guess what?

20:41.000 --> 20:42.100
Her body came up light?

20:42.100 --> 20:43.600
Six pounds light.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.400
That's six pints of blood

20:45.400 --> 20:48.500
at a pound each nowhere
in or around the body.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.200
She was moved.

20:53.900 --> 20:54.600
Hey.

20:55.300 --> 20:57.300
The trace from the
puncture wound came back.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.800
It's zinc, which is electrically
coated onto steel

21:00.800 --> 21:02.200
to make galvanized pipe.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.900
Well, we should go back,
expand the search perimeter,

21:07.900 --> 21:09.600
try to find
the actual murder site.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.000
Okay. I'll get a
hold to swing.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.100
We're going to
need some help.

21:12.100 --> 21:12.800
Okay.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.800
I heard you're
holding vincent lafoon

21:31.800 --> 21:33.300
on suspicion of murder.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.300
His lawyer
called me.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.200
I'd be surprised.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.100
Yes, the guy is a bit
rough around the edges,

21:39.100 --> 21:41.100
but I don't think
that he, uh...

21:43.700 --> 21:44.600
Hello.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.200
Nick.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.400
Why don't you, uh,
take the offices,

21:52.400 --> 21:54.800
and ronnie and I will start
in the storage area.

21:55.200 --> 21:56.300
My name is stanley.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.900
But you call me stan.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.600
- HEY.
- HEY, NICKY, WHAT YOU GOT?

23:07.400 --> 23:09.200
I've got the hat lafoon
was wearing

23:09.200 --> 23:10.400
in the surveillance video.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.600
The wear on the strap
indicates

23:12.600 --> 23:15.400
that's it's been set larger...
Like it was adjusted

23:15.400 --> 23:17.500
for somebody with a bigger head
or something.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.700
So i'm going to get it back, see
if I can get some prints off it.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.200
Okay, i'll, uh, meet you
back at the lab.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.700
Dickie jones.
And you are?

23:35.600 --> 23:36.400
Busy.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.100
How about after your shift, I take you out
for a cup of coffee?

23:40.700 --> 23:42.400
And I could tell you
my whole life story.

23:43.900 --> 23:44.900
No, thanks.

23:45.200 --> 23:46.700
It's just a cup
of coffee, doll.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.800
I'm not asking
you to make love.

23:52.200 --> 23:53.700
Not right away, anyway.

23:55.600 --> 23:58.500
You know, I could open up
new worlds to you.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.100
Have you ever had
the back of those thighs

24:00.100 --> 24:02.600
kissed by a man...
Who's standing up?

24:05.500 --> 24:07.000
So you find dwarves funny?

24:08.800 --> 24:10.600
Sometimes, yeah.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.000
Come on, what do you say?

24:12.400 --> 24:14.100
Is it because
of my receding hairline?

24:16.100 --> 24:17.900
I don't go out with persons
of interest

24:17.900 --> 24:19.500
in an ongoing investigation.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.200
Well, I just think you might
be missing out, pookie.

24:24.900 --> 24:26.200
Don't call me pookie.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.200
But you haven't told me
your name.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.100
Catherine.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.800
- CATHERINE.
- CATHERINE.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.400
Catherine.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
Well, catherine,

24:39.000 --> 24:41.400
we little people see things
from a different perspective--

24:41.600 --> 24:44.700
Things other people might miss.

24:47.500 --> 24:48.900
If you're implying
that you know something

24:48.900 --> 24:51.500
about weatherly's death,
and you're not giving it up,

24:51.500 --> 24:52.300
that makes you,

24:52.300 --> 24:54.900
at a minimum,
an accessory after the fact,

24:55.200 --> 24:58.600
and that buys a long stretch
for a stubby guy.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.400
I'm just talking, doll-face.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.600
Dickie.

25:02.300 --> 25:04.700
Why don't we leave the nice
woman alone to do her work?

25:05.300 --> 25:06.200
Here's my card.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.000
If there's anything
that you want to tell me

25:08.000 --> 25:09.700
as it pertains
to the case...

25:11.300 --> 25:12.400
Uh, call me.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.500
Hey, archie,
could you bring up

26:28.500 --> 26:30.900
the surveillance video
from repulsion pictures, please?

26:30.900 --> 26:32.400
Yeah, got it over here.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.400
What's the best you can get me
on the face?

26:49.500 --> 26:50.300
He seems to be

26:50.300 --> 26:52.300
deliberately looking away
from the camera.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.000
Take him to the window.

26:57.900 --> 26:58.700
Freeze that.

26:59.500 --> 27:00.700
Zoom in on the sleeve.

27:03.100 --> 27:06.300
Does that jacket look a little
small for that guy to you?

27:06.300 --> 27:07.200
Maybe.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.200
I measured the height
of the window.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.400
It's five feet.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.800
How tall is the guy?

27:15.200 --> 27:18.300
Well, he's a head
taller than that window.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.900
Vincent lafoon's
only five-foot-ten.

27:19.900 --> 27:22.300
This guy's six-foot-two,
six-foot-three, easy.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.900
And a lot rounder.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.500
The only guy that big
in the bunch is mason.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.200
Catherine, it's nick.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.000
Listen, the surveillance
video footage is a fake.

27:32.000 --> 27:32.500
I think we got

27:32.500 --> 27:34.000
the wrong brother
in custody.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.300
I think mason set up vincent
to set oliver up.

27:37.800 --> 27:39.000
It's getting complicated.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.200
Hey, ronnie, anything?

28:00.700 --> 28:01.700
No.

28:03.500 --> 28:05.200
This place is creeping me out.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.600
It's supposed to.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.600
I think we just found
our murder weapon.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.500
Hidden in plain sight.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.500
Catherine?

29:29.000 --> 29:30.300
I've got something else here.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.400
Looks like weatherly's
missing heel.

29:46.500 --> 29:47.700
This is where
she died.

29:54.300 --> 29:55.300
Ah, damn.

29:55.300 --> 29:56.500
Oh, good.

29:57.500 --> 29:59.900
Auxiliary generator
just kicked in.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.300
And I don't have any service.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.400
Mine's dead, too.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.300
I'm going to get a dolly
for you to move this thing.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.200
Photo it and get it
back to the lab.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.300
Okay.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.300
Here you go.

30:56.300 --> 30:57.200
Thanks.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.000
Damn it.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.600
Control, this is c-147 lake
for c13 willows.

31:20.600 --> 31:21.700
Copy, c-147.

31:21.700 --> 31:22.600
Stand by.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.900
C-147, you have c-13. Over.

31:27.100 --> 31:28.200
This is catherine.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.400
Hey, catherine,
i left my cell phone at the studio.

31:31.400 --> 31:32.900
I need to go back
and get it.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.100
Yeah, you'd better.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.200
They're department issue.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.200
And if you lose it,
you replace it.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.000
Does that include the
cost of the contract?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.100
Oh, yeah.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.100
Damn.

31:42.500 --> 31:43.500
I'll see you later.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.600
We found the pipe
that killed weatherly.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.200
It's in the print lab
being processed.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.800
She was killed
on the soundstage

32:15.800 --> 32:16.900
and then dragged over.

32:16.900 --> 32:18.600
We've got a warrant out
for mason lafoon.

32:18.600 --> 32:19.500
We're looking for him now.

32:19.700 --> 32:21.300
Okay. Let me know
what you find out.

32:28.000 --> 32:28.900
What do you want?

32:28.900 --> 32:31.100
- POOKIE, IT'S ME, DICKIE.
- I KNOW.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.500
I've got information I think
you might be interested in.

32:33.900 --> 32:35.100
Okay, shoot.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.000
No. It has to be in person.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.600
Where are you?

32:38.600 --> 32:39.900
I'm at the studio.

32:41.100 --> 32:43.100
I thought there was no phone
transmission from there.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.900
There wasn't.
Now there is.

32:44.900 --> 32:46.900
That's how it is with phones
and electrical storms.

32:46.900 --> 32:48.200
Look, it's urgent.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.400
Get here as soon as you can.

32:49.400 --> 32:50.400
I just came from there.

32:50.400 --> 32:52.700
Why didn't you tell me then,
you annoying little man?

32:53.700 --> 32:55.000
The situation is evolving.

32:56.500 --> 32:57.500
If you're screwing with me,

32:57.500 --> 33:00.300
i will to string you up
and beat you senseless.

33:00.700 --> 33:01.900
I look forward to it.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.000
Just hurry.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.300
That's you, mason.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.200
All six feet, three inches
of you

33:10.200 --> 33:11.900
impersonating your brother,

33:12.500 --> 33:14.400
which makes you good
for weatherly's murder.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.100
- YOU DID THAT ONE, TOO, DIDN'T YOU?
- NO, NO, NO.

33:16.100 --> 33:17.600
Nobody killed
weatherly, okay?

33:17.600 --> 33:18.800
- SHE KILLED HERSELF.
- OH, REALLY?

33:18.800 --> 33:20.200
What, she axed herself
in the back to death?

33:20.200 --> 33:21.300
No, you don't understand.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.600
She... She...
It was an accident.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
She tripped.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.000
Good night, weatherly.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.500
Good night, kid.
Yeah, great stuff tonight.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.100
- HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.900
Bye. See you tomorrow. Okay.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.000
Whoa, ah!

33:39.000 --> 33:40.000
Call 911!

33:40.300 --> 33:41.200
Call 911!

33:41.200 --> 33:42.000
Wait, let's
think about this.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.700
- NO, BUT STANLEY...
- MASON, SHE'S DEAD!

33:43.900 --> 33:45.100
This time she's
not coming back.

33:45.100 --> 33:47.300
We've got so many health
and safety violations.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.600
If we report one more
set-related accident--

33:49.600 --> 33:51.000
Especially one
resulting in a death--

33:51.000 --> 33:53.500
We will lose our bond,
our liability insurance,

33:53.600 --> 33:54.800
osha will shut us down,

33:54.800 --> 33:56.300
we'll get our asses sued
for wrongful death,

33:56.300 --> 33:58.400
and that will be the end
of repulsion pictures!

33:58.400 --> 33:59.400
Is that what
you want?

33:59.600 --> 34:00.800
Is that
what you want?!

34:00.800 --> 34:01.800
No!

34:02.800 --> 34:05.200
He... He said
"the show must go on, "

34:05.200 --> 34:07.900
th-that weatherly...
Would have wanted it that...

34:07.900 --> 34:08.900
I don't...

34:09.000 --> 34:10.900
We... We didn't kill anybody.

34:11.100 --> 34:12.300
But you made it
look like a murder,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.699
and then you framed
your brother.

34:14.100 --> 34:17.000
Well, he's been treating me
like crap my entire life.

34:20.500 --> 34:21.800
Yeah, but for that,
you're going to send him

34:21.800 --> 34:23.600
to jail for the rest
of his life?

34:24.300 --> 34:26.199
This was all...
This was all stanley's idea.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.199
Do you realize
how much trouble you're in?

34:28.500 --> 34:32.500
Look, stanley was the one who
wanted to frame vincent, okay?

34:32.500 --> 34:34.800
All I was supposed
to do was clean up

34:34.800 --> 34:37.500
the accident scene
and pretend to be vince

34:37.500 --> 34:39.300
and buy the roses
and that was it.

34:39.300 --> 34:40.500
The rest was him.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.699
If you don't believe me,
talk to the dwarf.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.500
Why? What did he have to do with it?

34:48.800 --> 34:50.100
Dickie saw the whole thing.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.000
...AND THAT WILL BE
The end of repulsion pictures.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.100
Is that
what you want?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.699
- IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!
- NO!

34:56.699 --> 34:59.600
And he's been trying to shake
down stanley ever since.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.200
Well, that would explain
the animosity.

35:50.800 --> 35:54.800
Control, this is c-13 willows,
trying to contact c-147 lake.

35:55.700 --> 35:57.600
C-13, control. Copy.
Stand by.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.200
Hello, dispatch?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Hello?

36:08.300 --> 36:11.400
C-13, control.
C-147 is not responding.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.400
Okay, thanks. Over and out.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.300
Catherine,

37:01.900 --> 37:02.800
it's ronnie.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.500
I'm stuck
at repulsion pictures.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.500
I need backup.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.900
- RONNIE...
- HELLO?

37:07.900 --> 37:09.300
Uh, i'm, i'm coming.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.000
- JUST...
- HELLO?

37:10.000 --> 37:11.500
Just stay
on the line.

37:13.100 --> 37:13.900
Ronnie?

37:13.900 --> 37:14.500
Hello?

37:15.400 --> 37:16.600
Ronnie!

37:17.900 --> 37:18.800
Hello?

37:21.300 --> 37:23.000
Dispatch, this
is c-13 willows

37:23.000 --> 37:25.700
requesting backup to meet
me at repulsion pictures.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.200
You gotta help me.

37:59.200 --> 38:01.000
I'm shot!
I'm shot!

38:01.000 --> 38:02.300
You gotta get us out of here.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.700
It's gonna be okay.
Keep your voice down.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.800
Do you know how many people
i've killed in this place?

38:09.500 --> 38:10.200
Shh!

38:10.200 --> 38:11.600
The irony is exquisite,

38:11.600 --> 38:14.400
but the pain is more formidable,
you know?

38:14.400 --> 38:17.200
I think the pain is preventing
me from enjoying the irony.

38:17.600 --> 38:18.600
Shh!

38:19.300 --> 38:20.200
Shut up!

38:21.000 --> 38:22.200
But I completely...

38:22.200 --> 38:23.200
For the love
of god,

38:23.400 --> 38:24.700
stop talking.

38:33.800 --> 38:34.900
Oh, that's not good.

38:36.200 --> 38:38.300
I should probably
stop talking

38:38.300 --> 38:39.700
and-and try and relax.

38:40.100 --> 38:41.300
That's good.
Yeah, stop talking.

38:41.700 --> 38:42.800
- BUT I CAN'T STOP TALKING.
- SHH.

38:42.800 --> 38:45.300
- I'VE GOT THAT THING THAT...
- SHUT UP OKAY? I KNOW.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.400
- IT'S A SYNDROME.
- SHH.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.000
It's a word...
There's a word for it.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.800
People have it. It's a syndrome.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.500
- I CAN'T STOP TALKING.
- OKAY.

38:52.700 --> 38:53.600
Zack.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.300
Stanley...

39:01.300 --> 39:02.600
Stanley, don't shoot me again.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.200
I don't want
to die, okay?

39:05.000 --> 39:06.800
You already
shot me twice.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.100
I learned my lesson, okay?

39:09.700 --> 39:10.600
Sir,

39:10.700 --> 39:11.700
i'm a csi.

39:12.500 --> 39:13.700
Think about what you're doing.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.900
Put down your weapon.

39:17.600 --> 39:20.100
I'm sorry, I don't think
i can do that.

39:43.600 --> 39:44.900
Are you okay?

39:47.200 --> 39:48.300
Yeah.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.400
I really loved her.

40:33.800 --> 40:36.300
I'm editing late,
like I always do,

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
and I hear a shot.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.800
So, I go outside
and check it out.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.200
Stanley!

40:53.600 --> 40:54.700
You gotta help me
hide the dwarf

40:54.700 --> 40:56.100
before the cops
come back.

40:56.500 --> 40:58.700
Dickie was blackmailing us
about weatherly's accident.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.400
He wants to bring
the whole company down.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.300
But you killed him!

41:02.500 --> 41:03.800
You killed dickie!

41:04.000 --> 41:05.100
What's it gonna be, zack?

41:05.100 --> 41:06.500
You gonna help me here or what?!

41:06.500 --> 41:08.700
Next thing you know,
i'm running for my life.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.500
And the nut job is chasing me.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.800
He shoots me,
and then I see the hot...

41:13.800 --> 41:14.600
You.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.100
And all I can think
the whole time is,

41:17.500 --> 41:19.100
"man, this is great.

41:19.800 --> 41:21.300
I could use this stuff."

41:21.500 --> 41:25.200
i mean, this is life
imitating art imitating life.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.800
You are so beautiful.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.000
You are... Your, your
face is so expressive.

41:30.300 --> 41:31.800
It-it emotes.

41:31.800 --> 41:33.400
You do terror so good.

41:33.500 --> 41:35.400
- I WASN'T ACTING.
- I KNOW.

41:35.800 --> 41:36.800
I'll see you.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.000
Well, hey, listen.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.400
If you ever get tired of
fighting crime, you know,

41:41.600 --> 41:43.700
there's always a future for you
in the horror business.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.400
I mean, i'll take you there.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.700
Thanks, but I like
what i'm doing.

41:48.200 --> 41:49.600
Oh, hey,
the offer's still good.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.700
Okay, thanks.

41:50.700 --> 41:51.400
No, i'm serious.

41:51.400 --> 41:53.500
I could build an entire
franchise around you.

41:53.500 --> 41:54.100
Bye.

41:54.100 --> 41:55.300
You me franchise

41:55.300 --> 41:56.300
call me. Sushi.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.300
That is impressive.

42:18.700 --> 42:20.700
As the woman's throat
is being slashed,

42:20.900 --> 42:24.300
you can actually see the entire
transverse view of the trachea.

42:24.300 --> 42:25.600
That's all you've got to say?

42:26.100 --> 42:28.400
I believe I can see
the epiglottis.

42:28.800 --> 42:29.900
Epiglottis?

42:30.600 --> 42:31.500
What about the pathos?

42:31.500 --> 42:33.700
I mean...
What about the humanity?

42:33.700 --> 42:36.100
This may be weatherly's
finest performance.

42:37.600 --> 42:39.400
Oh, just watch the movie.

42:39.400 --> 42:49.400
