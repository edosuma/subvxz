00:15.307 --> 00:16.350
- Hi, babe.
- Hi.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.453
I've still got 23 seconds left!

00:51.093 --> 00:52.302
One second, Simon!

01:03.146 --> 01:04.647
Awesome.

01:04.647 --> 01:06.275
- Okay.
- One minute!

01:09.069 --> 01:10.529
Five minutes is up. Let's go.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.867
Hold on. Hold on.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.327
Okay. Hold on.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.247
Oh, my God. Okay, great.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.542
Here. Let's get-- That's dirty.

01:23.542 --> 01:26.044
Quick. Quick sticks.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.798
- Okay. Here we go.
- Do you need this?

01:29.798 --> 01:31.550
- I'm seeing that house again today, babe.
- Right.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.843
The one with the five bathrooms?

01:32.843 --> 01:34.970
One for every single member
of this family.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.054
Can you imagine? I mean,

01:36.054 --> 01:37.723
I didn't know that was a thing.
It's like a chÃ¢teau.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.433
We're gonna have more bathrooms
than we know what to do with.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.767
What do you care? You shit at work.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.436
- We don't say "shit."
- You're right, I'm sorry.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.647
Well, you know what? When we move,
I will shit at home like a king.

01:45.647 --> 01:46.857
Shit, shit, shit.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.942
- Don't say "shit."
- Where's the baguette?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.444
- What? What baguette?
- I need a baguette

01:50.444 --> 01:51.945
and a beret for French class.
Where are they?

01:51.945 --> 01:54.656
What? I-- This is the first I've heard
about a baguette or a beret.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.033
- Oh, my God. Mom.
- What? I didn't--

01:56.033 --> 01:58.619
I didn't get an e-mail from Ms. Lauren.
Did you hear about the baguettes?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.120
- Sorry, I didn't. I gotta go.
- Or the beret?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.205
- Okay. See you.
- Good luck.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.831
- You can't close it because--
- I'm gonna fail!

02:02.831 --> 02:04.208
- Take this guy out.
- All right, buddy.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.544
- I am keeping it. I want it!
- Okay. But you cannot close your bag.

02:22.643 --> 02:26.688
- So, how was your night with Will?
- It was fun for, like, 30 seconds.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.649
And then it just
turned into total drama again.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.943
We were literally screaming at each other

02:30.943 --> 02:32.611
on a street corner
at 1:00 a.m. in the morning.

02:32.611 --> 02:37.658
Oh, my God. Just hearing that makes me
feel more alive than I have in 20 years.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.451
I need to start yelling more.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.869
- Yelling is so primal.
- I know.

02:40.869 --> 02:41.995
Nagging's not primal.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.289
No, it was-- I'm not gonna lie,
it was a great night.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.542
But I can't-- Like, honestly,

02:46.542 --> 02:48.877
I don't have enough time
for made-up problems in my life.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.755
I have enough real problems.
Like that one.

02:51.755 --> 02:55.509
I'm supposed to see that house today
in Encino for the third time.

02:55.509 --> 02:58.011
And I swear to God if I'm not gonna
buy it, she's gonna fire me.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.847
I told you not to hire Diane

02:59.847 --> 03:01.390
- as your Realtor.
- I know.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.517
She's an office mom.
She's out of our league.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.310
She's wearing a fucking blazer.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.728
- I get it. You work in an office.
- Yeah.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.897
Some of us,
we're still stuck working at home.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.859
Just 'cause I wear sweatpants
doesn't mean I don't have an actual job.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.777
- She's too fancy for me. I know.
- Yeah.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.655
I know that.
If we weren't both parents here,

03:16.655 --> 03:19.116
there's no way she would ever
work with me in the first place.

03:19.116 --> 03:21.076
- Never.
- Hi!

03:21.076 --> 03:23.453
- Diane!
- Don't imitate her face.

03:24.663 --> 03:25.998
- Hi, Sylvia.
- Hi.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.459
Such an exciting day.
We're putting an offer in.

03:29.459 --> 03:33.005
That's right. Today is totally about
buying a house with money.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.840
Because this one
put me through the wringer.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.133
- Guilty!
- We have looked at

03:36.133 --> 03:38.051
over 40 homes this year.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.845
- No.
- I sold Ellen and Portia their home

03:39.845 --> 03:40.929
in one day.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.765
- I heard good things about Ellen.
- Me too!

03:43.765 --> 03:45.642
I told her, "There are no shortcuts.

03:45.642 --> 03:48.187
You can't have square footage
and brand-spanking-new

03:48.187 --> 03:49.730
and location
all at a certain price point."

03:49.730 --> 03:51.982
I know. You were right. I was wrong.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.319
And what she got
was an amazing fixer-upper.

03:55.319 --> 03:57.070
- It's--
- I mean, it's a project, to be sure.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.657
But now that the little one's in
kindergarten, it'll be a dream next act.

04:00.657 --> 04:02.826
I finally have the time to do it.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.995
So anyway, listen, ladies.
I'm gonna be late.

04:04.995 --> 04:07.789
I gotta get to Malibu
to show a beach compound.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.168
Can't say who it's for,
but it rhymes with Schminn Liesel.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.713
But I will be back in
the deep Valley to see you later.

04:14.713 --> 04:16.507
- Thank you, Diane. You're the best.
- Bye-bye.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.550
Thank you for all your hard work,
your patience.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.927
- Good luck.
- You know what's crazy?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.178
Oh, my God.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.014
Schminn Liesel is actually the name
of my great-grandfather from Estonia.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.558
- No. No.
- <i>Papi</i> Schminn.

04:27.726 --> 04:31.146
I thought Schminn Liesel was
the fifth child in the von Trapp family.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.981
- I've heard that. Yeah.
- Schminnie.

04:34.066 --> 04:35.067
Oh, dear.

04:38.487 --> 04:41.615
So, what else?
We think of doing anything exciting today?

04:41.615 --> 04:43.951
- Oh, my God. It's a big one.
- Yeah. Walk me through it.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.328
Going to pick up
vaccination records for Sam.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.580
First sleepaway camp.
Yeah, it's pretty exciting. Yeah.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.832
- I just love days like these.
- You mean every day?

04:50.832 --> 04:52.125
I do.

05:03.846 --> 05:07.349
<i>Hello, Sylvia. It's Will.
It's a terrible emergency.</i>

05:07.349 --> 05:08.642
<i>You have to call me.</i>

05:13.814 --> 05:14.857
What's the emergency?

05:16.066 --> 05:18.151
There's not actually an emergency.
I was just joking.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.319
<i>How you doing?</i>

05:19.319 --> 05:21.029
Okay. What do you want?

05:21.029 --> 05:22.698
Let's chat. What are you up to?

05:23.490 --> 05:24.616
What's going on?

05:24.616 --> 05:28.954
Okay, fine. I'll tell you what's going on.
You left your credit card at my bar.

05:29.538 --> 05:31.707
- Fuck.
- If you wanted to hang out with me again,

05:31.707 --> 05:33.166
you didn't have to leave
some trinket behind.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.128
- You could've just asked me to lunch.
- I really-- I don't have time for this.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.462
- So, lunch?
- No.

05:37.462 --> 05:38.505
- Brunch?
- No.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.466
Dim sum? That's my final offer.
You dim sum, you lose some.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.593
Okay. Goodbye, Will.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.429
Come on. Wait.
Don't you want your credit card back?

05:45.429 --> 05:48.599
You yelled at me on the street
in the middle of the night last night.

05:48.599 --> 05:51.894
Nobody treats me like that in my life
except for all three of my children.

05:51.894 --> 05:54.396
You yelled at me too.
We yell. People yell.

05:54.396 --> 05:57.482
We texted each other after.
It's fine. It's all good.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.817
I'm over it. Get over it.

05:58.817 --> 05:59.902
You get over it.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.409
Well, the water's rising,
but I'm too afraid to flush it again.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.537
I don't know. Plunging might fix it,
it also might make it worse.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.623
Oh, yeah?
You should have a home repair show.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.625
I'm so ready to leave this house.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.710
- You got this.
- Oh, my God. It's overflowing!

06:16.710 --> 06:18.378
- What'd you do?
- Nothing. I was just looking at it.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.882
Oh, no! It's everywhere.
Why is this my life?

06:22.758 --> 06:24.384
Do you need me to come home?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.428
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye. Love you, babe.

06:26.428 --> 06:27.846
Toilet!

06:27.846 --> 06:30.307
Fuck. Shit. No!

06:37.397 --> 06:38.315
Fuck.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.734
Coming!

06:42.903 --> 06:44.112
What are you doing here?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.907
- They call it "being a hero."
- I don't have time for this.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.618
I am a great man.
They will write songs about me.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.995
- What are you doing?
- I need your help. Can you come in here?

06:51.995 --> 06:54.540
Can I grab some of these avocados?

06:57.167 --> 06:59.086
Oh, God.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.754
I promise you, it's just water.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.422
- Oh, yeah? Okay.
- Make it stop.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.966
I don't know how to make it stop.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.968
That ain't good.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.762
Did you do this? Was this you?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.138
- Could you just fix it?
- Yep.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.432
There you go.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.519
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- There you go. Where's your mop?

07:16.103 --> 07:18.814
It's in the kitchen.
But you don't have to do that.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.943
It's fine.
Like 60% of bartending is mopping.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.403
Thank you. You don't have to do that.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.113
Your house is very lovely. Very homey.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.322
You mean small.

07:27.322 --> 07:28.824
No, I mean very homelike.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.577
Oh, my God. There's his iPad.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.415
Secret iPad. Someone watching porno?

07:36.415 --> 07:37.916
- He's eight.
- And?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.752
When I was eight, I was disgusting.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.256
- Don't put that in there. That's gross.
- Why?

07:44.256 --> 07:46.425
- Why is that gross?
- Because people lie down in there.

07:46.425 --> 07:48.844
- Not gross. You can drink toilet water.
- You could do a lot of things.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.345
- Exactly. Thirsty?
- Please take that--

07:50.345 --> 07:52.723
You wanna suckle on the threads?

07:53.849 --> 07:56.560
What do you wanna do after this?
You wanna go to the beach?

07:56.560 --> 07:58.896
Get some oysters? Wanna go see a movie?

07:58.896 --> 08:03.275
I can't. I'm busy. I'm putting
an offer in on a house, actually.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.110
Yeah. After I do the final walk-through.

08:05.110 --> 08:06.987
Nice. What's wrong with this place?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.114
We've outgrown it.
It's too small for the five of us.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.575
There's one bathroom.
It's-- And-- Which is flooding.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.160
- Tell me about the new place.
- It's great!

08:13.160 --> 08:16.163
It's, you know, fixer-upper.
Needs a bit of work.

08:16.872 --> 08:18.582
- Can I come on the walk-through? Please.
- No.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.292
Please.
I'm actually very good with renovations.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.252
- Since when?
- I redid most of the bar by myself.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.170
Really?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.172
Yeah. It was a chicken slaughterhouse
when we got it.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.757
- Get out.
- Yeah.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.218
- Wow.
- We still find feathers and beaks.

08:29.718 --> 08:33.054
I know. Seriously, though. Can I come?
I'll be very helpful, I promise.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.265
Okay. Just don't talk.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.518
- I won't.
- Don't--

08:37.518 --> 08:39.394
Just don't talk to me or anybody.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.647
- No talking. Perfect.
- Nope.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.857
So, how often do you see Audrey?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.194
I don't know. Every few weeks.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.739
I still have a bunch of stuff
I haven't moved out of the house.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.951
So, you know, I'm periodically
going back there to get some shit.

08:53.951 --> 08:55.244
What? Why?

08:55.869 --> 08:58.080
Just-- You know.
Takes a long time to move.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.414
You can do it in a day.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.084
It's not just the stuff, you know.
Gandalf is still there.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.087
- Audrey has Gandalf?
- Yeah.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.756
But he was yours first.
You love that lizard.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.926
I still love Gandalf. It's just--
She insisted on keeping him

09:10.926 --> 09:14.137
'cause she didn't think I was
responsible enough to take care of him.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.973
Well, that's ridiculous.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.643
He's like your son in lizard form.
You should have custody.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.771
I have joint custody,
'cause I go see him all the time.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.357
What?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.985
- What? You can tell me. Tell me.
- Nothing. I just-- I don't know.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.822
It's hard to recover from a divorce
if your lives are still totally entwined.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.950
Well, divorce is a messy thing.
It's not like one day you're married,

09:34.950 --> 09:36.910
the next day
you never see each other again.

09:37.953 --> 09:41.081
Have you ever thought
that you leave your stuff there

09:41.081 --> 09:44.209
and she keeps Gandalf
so you two can stay connected

09:44.209 --> 09:48.255
and keep this drama
or whatever it is alive?

09:48.255 --> 09:53.093
Now that you mention it,
our arguments are pretty thrilling.

09:54.261 --> 09:58.056
And they often lead to sex.

09:58.056 --> 09:59.641
There you go. There you have it.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.143
Very exciting stuff.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.436
No, thank you.

10:02.436 --> 10:05.397
- We're talking charged fights.
- No, thank you.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.399
- Absolutely not. Nope.
- Is that gross to you?

10:07.399 --> 10:10.694
- Don't "yuck" my yum.
- Stop.

10:12.571 --> 10:16.033
So, tell me about this home.
What are we talking about here?

10:16.658 --> 10:19.494
- It's got really good bones.
- Okay.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.997
Bigger, square footage. There's a pool.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.249
Great. Is it, like, a full teardown?

10:24.249 --> 10:27.336
Just, like,
a kind of a renovation-type deal?

10:27.336 --> 10:30.964
It's not really a teardown or a flip.

10:32.216 --> 10:33.842
It's a...

10:33.842 --> 10:36.637
It's a former assisted living facility.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.019
Closed after COVID.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.981
- I bet it did.
- Fuck you. Fuck off.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.066
Uh-huh.

10:51.068 --> 10:53.737
- Just a little bit different. Okay? Yeah.
- Interesting. Can't wait to see.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.114
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:56.114 --> 11:00.077
- You made it. So glad to see you.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.703
And you must be Charlie. At long last.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.580
- Hi.
- It's so nice to finally meet you.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.957
- No.
- Hi. No.

11:04.957 --> 11:07.751
- This is Will. He's my contractor.
- I'm Will. Yeah. I'm a contractor.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.295
- Great. Glad you came to have a look.
- Professional contractor.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.674
And he's also the host of a TV show
on Nickelodeon called "We Be Jammin'."

11:13.674 --> 11:15.092
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, my goodness.

11:15.092 --> 11:18.053
And we teach children
to be confident using reggae.

11:18.637 --> 11:20.472
Haven't heard of it. Have to check it out.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.891
Charlie couldn't come today.
He was just too slammed at work.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.686
- So-- Yeah.
- This house is gorgeous.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.770
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.022
- The "buttrels." The-- All of this.
- Yeah.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.858
The-- These details.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.651
What-- The-- 1926, obviously?

11:32.651 --> 11:33.986
- 1986.
- That's what I was gonna say.

11:33.986 --> 11:36.029
- Close.
- It's got the 50-year cycle. You know--

11:36.029 --> 11:37.739
So, the interior of the house is--

11:37.739 --> 11:40.617
- 6,000 square feet, I would imagine?
- It is 3,500 square feet.

11:40.617 --> 11:42.244
- Meh, I don't know about that.
- But--

11:42.244 --> 11:43.787
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.163
Why don't we check that? I'll eyeball it.

11:45.163 --> 11:46.832
- Yeah. The lot is 6,000.
- Yeah, we'll eyeball it.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.209
So, it presents as a 6K there.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.253
Come on in and see it.
We're gonna do our fourth,

11:51.253 --> 11:53.213
and hopefully final, walk-through.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.632
- Come on!
- Praise Jah.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.593
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.929
And you got seven chess boards,
which is not easy to find. Even now.

12:00.929 --> 12:04.683
So, keep your mind clear,
this is a whole remodel. Yes.

12:04.683 --> 12:05.684
Wow.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.061
Yes. This could be the foyer or--

12:08.061 --> 12:10.230
Yeah. Nice high ceilings.

12:10.230 --> 12:11.899
Very high, very spacious...

12:11.899 --> 12:13.942
- Can barely touch 'em.
- ...great acoustics. Yeah.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.611
- Yeah, great acoustics.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

12:15.611 --> 12:19.114
And it's in a school system here.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.701
Lots of railings and ramps
if safety is your thing.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.578
- Look at this. Does this work?
- Yeah, and--

12:27.664 --> 12:29.791
It does! It works.

12:33.629 --> 12:36.715
Could you actually return that
to its starting position, please?

12:50.145 --> 12:51.563
Thank you. Thank you so much.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.689
What's this?

12:52.689 --> 12:54.900
<i>Medic.</i>

12:54.900 --> 12:56.735
<i>Medic. Medi--</i>

12:56.735 --> 12:58.320
Jesus Christ.

12:59.321 --> 13:00.864
Everybody loves that button.

13:02.241 --> 13:04.284
But you know what? The good thing is,

13:04.284 --> 13:07.371
with the wiring in the ceiling,
you could just put in a sound system...

13:07.371 --> 13:08.705
- Oh, yeah.
- ...throughout the whole--

13:08.705 --> 13:10.123
- That is a good idea.
- No, not--

13:10.123 --> 13:11.041
Yes,

13:11.041 --> 13:12.960
- we've got to clear all this stuff out.
- Well, that works.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.963
- Yeah, I guess so. My goodne--
- That suits you.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.465
- I would just--
- I wouldn't sit in that.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.050
- Don't even-- Don't--
- Be careful there. Do--

13:20.050 --> 13:23.345
- Oh, no. I wouldn't do that. What--
- I'm good. It's like a little hammock.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.056
- So, you're the contractor?
- You got it.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.351
Yes, I've been "contractoring"
for over a decade now.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.728
And we've never crossed paths
in all that time.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.314
I think we have, actually.
You just don't remember me.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.483
- I think I would remember.
- No.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.318
Yeah. Uh-huh.

13:40.070 --> 13:43.490
- Yeah, so this is my favorite room.
- Wow.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.742
It's got a real East Coast
kind of vibe about it.

13:45.742 --> 13:49.246
Yeah, sort of colonial hospice,
Cape Cod mortuary.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.457
Yeah, I'm gonna knock that wall down
and make this the big dining room

13:52.457 --> 13:55.002
- where we can entertain, and-- Yeah.
- Nice. Very cool.

13:55.002 --> 13:57.254
Does it feel to you like someone
has died in this room?

13:57.254 --> 13:59.089
'Cause it feels to me like someone
has died in here.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.425
- It's irrelevant.
- Not in this room. Yep.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.427
All right.
Does all this stuff come with the place,

14:03.427 --> 14:06.805
or do the owners plan on taking it
with them into the next realm?

14:06.805 --> 14:10.601
Can you just stop? Just stop, please.
I know you're having fun, but I--

14:10.601 --> 14:11.768
- Enough.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

14:11.768 --> 14:14.062
You're right. It's too much. You're right.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.481
- Thank you. Thank you.
- I apologize. The wood is very nice.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.734
- That's not real wood.
- Oh, well, great.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.487
And this would be Simon's room.

14:22.988 --> 14:24.198
It's got a little kitchen.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.326
Every boy's dream.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.458
Thank you.

14:34.458 --> 14:38.212
- This is Frances's.
- This one has a full-size fridge.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.674
There's teeth and blood in here.

14:42.674 --> 14:48.180
But I could contractor
that right out of here, no problem. Easy.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.849
- Yeah, that's easy to deal with.
- Yeah.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.688
- And this would be Maeve's room.
- Another little kitchen.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.858
What the fuck?

15:01.485 --> 15:04.446
- You saw that, right? You guys saw that?
- Drafts. Just drafts.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.781
That's happened before?

15:05.781 --> 15:07.324
Let's check out the parlor.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.743
That was not a draft.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.495
I mean, the kids will love that.

15:11.495 --> 15:12.538
Love what?

15:14.164 --> 15:15.749
What are you talking about?

15:15.749 --> 15:18.210
And this would be our bedroom.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.087
The primary.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.255
Yeah, and obviously, you know,

15:21.255 --> 15:23.382
we would put up a wall between
the toilet and the bedroom.

15:23.382 --> 15:26.385
And we'd move the kitchenette,
and the IV rack,

15:26.385 --> 15:28.512
and the rubber curtain,
and the rubber curtain rack,

15:28.512 --> 15:31.098
and the rails, and the safety bars, and--

15:31.098 --> 15:33.100
Yeah, and then we'd just put a few
windows here...

15:33.100 --> 15:34.101
- Oh, yeah.
- ... somehow.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.353
That's easy. You just
blow right through that wall.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.105
That is not an exterior wall.

15:38.856 --> 15:39.773
Look at this.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.984
- <i>Medic.</i>
- Jesus! Sorry.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.819
- <i>Medic.</i>
- You wanna press it twice.

15:43.819 --> 15:46.530
- <i>Medic. Me--</i>
- You wanna press it twice. It's--

15:47.865 --> 15:49.658
- Looks different from the other button.
- Yeah.

15:50.868 --> 15:51.869
Cool.

15:52.411 --> 15:53.495
Got a poo chair.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.038
Yeah.

15:55.622 --> 15:56.623
- Comes with. Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.958
- All right.
- Yeah, I just--

15:58.667 --> 15:59.668
Fix it up.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.592
- Please don't get in that thing.
- I really want to.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.594
- Please. I'm begging you.
- I really, really want to.

16:08.594 --> 16:09.970
Oh, man.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.098
What does Charlie think of this place?

16:13.098 --> 16:14.349
- He loves it.
- Yeah.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.311
But at this point, he would love anything
that was bigger and that we could afford.

16:17.311 --> 16:19.104
He'd move into an abandoned Blockbuster
if he could.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.273
Those are all GNCs now, unfortunately.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.568
But can I be honest with you?

16:24.568 --> 16:26.820
No, please, stick to
your usual tact and charm.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.531
Okay, this place is a nightmare.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.742
And it will cost so much money

16:31.742 --> 16:35.787
to make this anything other
than something that is terrible.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.998
Why don't you move into somewhere
more turnkey, you know?

16:37.998 --> 16:39.416
Isn't Charlie a lawyer?

16:39.416 --> 16:42.044
Yeah, but we have three kids
and one income.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.713
And we live in the second
most expensive city in America.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.465
So stop mooching and get a job.

16:46.465 --> 16:49.259
I've been out of the workforce
for 13 years, raising my children.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.802
I can't just "get a job."

16:50.802 --> 16:53.347
I'll sign you up for ZipRecruiter, okay?

16:53.347 --> 16:56.975
Some of the dumbest motherfuckers
on Earth have jobs. You can get a job.

16:56.975 --> 17:00.395
Look, if we want to get a bigger house,
this is what we can afford.

17:00.395 --> 17:05.150
So, I'm just gonna roll up my sleeves
and fix this thing up.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.944
It'll take a few years,
and then we'll move in.

17:07.944 --> 17:09.946
Yeah, a few years, a few crucifixes.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.532
Listen, we live very different lives,
Will. That's the fact, okay?

17:12.532 --> 17:14.701
You can do whatever you want
and go wherever you want

17:14.701 --> 17:17.454
with your crazy hats and whatever.

17:17.454 --> 17:21.208
Being a mom is basically doing
a lot of things you don't wanna do.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.126
You sound like a robot, okay?

17:23.126 --> 17:25.628
Those are not written rules.
Just bail on this motherfucker.

17:25.628 --> 17:26.964
- What?
- Yeah.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.423
Charlie wants to move.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.051
And the kids are getting older,
and they need more space.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.177
Do you wanna live here?

17:32.177 --> 17:34.930
Of course I don't wanna fucking live here.
What are you talking about?

17:34.930 --> 17:37.641
- No.
- I don't. I-- It's a haunted nightmare.

17:37.641 --> 17:42.020
Well, then why don't we get out of here,
douse ourselves in holy water,

17:42.020 --> 17:44.398
and tell Charlie that you
are not moving into this place?

17:45.858 --> 17:50.362
I'll tell Charlie if you go
to Audrey's place and get your stuff

17:51.280 --> 17:52.531
and just make a clean break.

17:52.531 --> 17:54.992
This is emotional blackmail.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.536
Because I care about you
you're gonna force me to do a thing

17:57.536 --> 17:59.288
- I don't wanna do?
- I care more about you.

17:59.288 --> 18:00.581
- I don't know about that.
- You need to

18:00.581 --> 18:02.332
- get out of that relationship.
- I don't know about that.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.626
- You need to get out of that girl's house.
- You know what?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.546
You're fucking on. Calling your shit.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.006
- Really?
- I'll do it. Yes.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.883
- Now, pull the plug. Yes.
- Really?

18:11.800 --> 18:13.427
Tell the scary lady
you don't wanna live here.

18:13.427 --> 18:15.846
- So now I have to do it?
- You do. Right now. They're coming.

18:15.846 --> 18:17.806
- We're on. We did it. We made the deal.
- How I'm supposed--

18:17.806 --> 18:19.308
- Go. Say it. Just go.
- I'm too scared.

18:19.308 --> 18:20.601
- Say it.
- Could you say it?

18:20.601 --> 18:22.060
All right, everybody.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.354
It's paperwork time.

18:24.354 --> 18:28.233
I know, everybody hates paperwork.
But I will make it fun and fast.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.944
We're just gonna get your name right th--

18:30.944 --> 18:33.572
I'm so sorry, I just-- I can't do it.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.407
- You got to be kidding me.
- I'm just-- I'm s--

18:35.407 --> 18:38.160
I'm fired. I'm definitely fired. I know.

18:38.160 --> 18:39.995
Let's be honest.
This place is terrible, okay?

18:40.662 --> 18:43.916
I mean, it's a real shitburger.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.043
It was my dad's.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.754
I'm so sorry.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.133
Oh, my God!

18:55.552 --> 18:56.970
I feel so much better.

18:56.970 --> 18:59.431
I'm not doing mine. Let's not do mine.
I don't wanna do it.

18:59.431 --> 19:00.933
- Let's get ice cream instead, okay?
- No.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.976
- I'll buy you ice cream.
- We are going to do your thing.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.394
- I don't want to. No.
- No. Absolutely not.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.104
- Come on. Please.
- Absolutely not.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.773
- We are going.
- It's so final.

19:07.773 --> 19:10.526
Once I take my stuff out, I will never
step foot in that house again,

19:10.526 --> 19:13.237
- and I hate thinking of that.
- Will, we're going.

19:13.237 --> 19:14.655
We're doing it. You're gonna feel good.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.198
- Oh, fuck.
- It's gonna be good.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.585
She's not home. Looks like
it's not meant to be. Let's go.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.295
Let's go around the side. Come on.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.008
Hello?

19:44.059 --> 19:45.060
Oh, my God.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.854
It's Gandalf.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.481
- Look at him.
- He looks miserable.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.150
- He looks so dejected. So sad.
- Yeah. He sees you.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.778
- Hi.
- He does. Look. Hi.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.280
- Hi.
- He just lit up.

19:56.822 --> 19:58.615
- He's so--
- His whole demeanor just shifted.

19:59.408 --> 20:01.076
- Hi.
- He lit up like a light.

20:01.827 --> 20:03.453
- Hi, little buddy.
- She's not home.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.622
Call her and figure out a time
to get your stuff.

20:05.622 --> 20:07.249
- Okay? Let's go.
- No. We gotta do it now.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.168
I'm gonna lose my nerve.
I need you for support.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.753
- Let's do it right now, okay?
- All right, how?

20:11.753 --> 20:13.755
You gotta get on all fours,
climb through this dog door.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.132
- What? No.
- You gotta do it.

20:15.132 --> 20:16.717
- It's the only way.
- You do it.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.343
- I won't fit, I've tried. Trust me.
- Come on.

20:18.343 --> 20:23.765
You gotta be very, very slender
and fit and flexible.

20:23.765 --> 20:27.644
Overall small, long torso, long legs.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.105
- I know what you're doing.
- Very narrow.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.233
- I like it. Okay.
- Good. Get through that doggy door.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.027
All right. I can do this.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.028
Hurry.

20:36.028 --> 20:39.489
Don't look at my ass unless
you want to get hypnotized.

20:39.489 --> 20:40.908
With all due respect, I do not.

20:40.908 --> 20:42.451
Just go. Come on.

20:46.622 --> 20:48.248
- Very graceful. Nice.
- Yes.

20:48.248 --> 20:51.084
- Look at that.
- You got it. Yes. Good.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.545
Nice. Get the door.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.508
- Nice. Good job. Here.
- Yes. Come on.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.760
- This way.
- Yeah.

21:11.772 --> 21:14.483
Will, what are you doing?

21:14.483 --> 21:15.984
Audrey, you're home.

21:15.984 --> 21:19.821
Will, you told me that this was
your house. What are you doing?

21:19.821 --> 21:21.490
- What are you doing?
- Sylvi--

21:21.490 --> 21:23.992
- No, I didn't. Wh--
- Sylvia, don't play dumb.

21:23.992 --> 21:26.161
I saw you crawl through the doggy door
on the security camera.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.372
You didn't tell me that you had
a fucking security camera.

21:28.372 --> 21:30.415
You wouldn't have
done that if you knew we did.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.377
I-- Look, in his defense,
he's just trying to come and get his stuff

21:33.377 --> 21:35.754
- and make a clean break. That's it.
- You don't get your stuff.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.714
- I want my stuff.
- You don't get your stuff

21:37.714 --> 21:39.842
because I'm pretty sure you can find
an old hairbrush

21:39.842 --> 21:43.220
and a cell phone charger somewhere else
instead of using it as a pathetic excuse

21:43.220 --> 21:46.640
- to come and stalk me.
- I'm stalking you now?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.724
As if.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.352
What the fuck, Sylvia?
Why are you even here?

21:50.352 --> 21:52.229
Don't you have kids and a family?

21:52.229 --> 21:54.648
I do. Do you--
Yes, you remembered. I do, yes.

21:54.648 --> 21:56.441
Well, if you really cared about Will,

21:56.441 --> 21:58.652
you wouldn't pull him into
whatever screwed up dynamic

21:58.652 --> 22:00.612
- you two have from years ago.
- Okay.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.490
You're like a couple of teenage girls
with your stupid nicknames

22:03.490 --> 22:05.450
and the catchphrases and the inside jokes.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.578
You'd be on the phone
until 4 a.m. all the time.

22:07.578 --> 22:10.706
I was up with a colicky baby.
Who else was I supposed to talk to?

22:10.706 --> 22:13.166
- Your husband.
- He was asleep. We had a system.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.544
Okay, so I was doing the nights
and he would do the mornings.

22:15.544 --> 22:16.837
So I would be breastfeeding--

22:16.837 --> 22:18.338
I don't give a shit.

22:18.338 --> 22:22.009
Your whole thing was so weird
and destructive.

22:22.009 --> 22:24.303
He would invite you to our date nights.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.138
He would wear clothes
that you picked out for him.

22:26.138 --> 22:28.182
What was I supposed to do?
Not set boundaries?

22:28.182 --> 22:29.183
It wasn't good for him.

22:29.183 --> 22:30.726
You know what? Now that we're broken up,

22:30.726 --> 22:34.229
I don't have to listen to your fucking
righteous bullshit speeches anymore, okay?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.439
Actually, you kind of do

22:35.439 --> 22:37.399
because you're standing in my dining room

22:37.399 --> 22:40.485
after crawling through the fucking
doggy door like a fucking dog.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.280
- Should we fuck?
- Get the fuck out!

22:43.280 --> 22:44.448
Get out!

22:44.448 --> 22:45.741
Do you mind if I use your toilet?

22:45.741 --> 22:47.868
- I'm so sorry to ask.
- Yes, just get out.

22:47.868 --> 22:49.203
Thank you.

22:51.330 --> 22:53.248
She makes me so mad.

22:53.832 --> 22:54.958
- You did really well.
- Did I?

22:54.958 --> 22:57.878
Yeah, except for the part where
you begged her to have sex with you.

22:57.878 --> 23:01.590
Yeah, that, in retrospect,
felt a little pathetic.

23:01.590 --> 23:03.050
- Yeah.
- If I had just--

23:03.050 --> 23:04.468
She was sending mixed signals, right?

23:05.177 --> 23:06.386
- I didn't read that.
- Really?

23:06.386 --> 23:08.138
- No.
- Were we not in the same room?

23:08.138 --> 23:09.765
I have something to cheer you up.

23:12.643 --> 23:15.938
- It's Gandalf.
- Yeah.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.607
Hey.

23:18.607 --> 23:20.150
- Look, you rescued him.
- Yeah.

23:20.150 --> 23:22.778
- He's already happier. I can tell.
- He looks so elated.

23:22.778 --> 23:24.112
He looks ten years younger.

23:25.155 --> 23:26.657
Thank you. Hello, baby.

23:26.657 --> 23:28.200
- Yeah.
- He's very sweet.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.035
Don't. Not-- No.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.079
Back off! I don't like it.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.456
- Look at him.
- We gotta get out of here.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.083
Can you believe she said
we were destructive?

23:36.083 --> 23:38.502
No. We're exactly the opposite.

23:38.502 --> 23:40.879
- We are constructive. We create.
- We're constructive.

23:44.550 --> 23:45.926
What happened?

23:47.678 --> 23:50.639
- Nice! Yes!
- Oh, the shame.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.474
I'm sorry, Audrey.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.143
Gandalf is so jacked up off of this shit.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.395
Oh. G-dawg.

24:04.486 --> 24:05.612
Okay.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.241
All right. Here we go. This is perfect.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.535
- So this is you, huh?
- This is me.

24:11.535 --> 24:13.579
- This is the hood. Nice.
- This is it, yeah.

24:13.579 --> 24:16.748
It's really nice during the day.
At night, a little weird.

24:16.748 --> 24:19.877
It's a lot of dogs barking
and humans screaming.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.587
And the occasional loud bang

24:21.587 --> 24:23.797
that you don't wanna ask
too many questions about.

24:23.797 --> 24:24.923
- You know what I mean?
- Well...

24:24.923 --> 24:26.508
- Yeah, but I like it.
- It's interesting.

24:26.508 --> 24:27.843
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:33.599 --> 24:35.809
Well, thank you for today.

24:35.809 --> 24:38.187
I don't think I would've had the courage
to say no to that dump

24:38.187 --> 24:41.565
if it hadn't been for your opinion.
So, thank you for that.

24:42.065 --> 24:47.571
Well, thank you for, you know,
finally making me cut ties with Audrey

24:47.571 --> 24:49.489
and pull that Band-Aid off.

24:49.489 --> 24:53.952
I should obviously not be seeing her ever,
so thank you.

24:56.622 --> 24:57.623
And...

24:58.749 --> 25:00.000
- And?
- And...

25:01.460 --> 25:03.587
- Thank you for rescuing Gandalf...
- Yes, you're welcome.

25:03.587 --> 25:06.089
- ...from that terrible environment.
- You're welcome.

25:06.089 --> 25:07.591
He says thank you as well.

25:07.591 --> 25:08.842
Look how elated he is.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.136
Yeah. Look at that.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.430
- Really appreciate it.
- You're welcome.

25:14.932 --> 25:17.809
The thing is, if I'm being honest,

25:17.809 --> 25:20.521
I'm not really cut out
to take care of Gandalf.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.357
You're not cut out
to take care of a lizard?

25:23.357 --> 25:26.568
I'm actually not cut out to take care of
really anything, including myself.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.779
It's a huge reason
why me and Audrey got divorced.

25:28.779 --> 25:31.573
- Will you take him? Please, take him.
- Absolutely not. Absolutely not.

25:31.573 --> 25:34.284
You have an instinct to protect him.
I saw it in you.

25:34.284 --> 25:37.037
Under no circumstances
am I taking that lizard.

25:37.037 --> 25:38.872
So, you were just driving home,

25:38.872 --> 25:41.250
and you thought we needed
a bearded dragon?

25:42.084 --> 25:44.753
Yeah, it was with one of those
lizard adoption things

25:44.753 --> 25:46.004
on the side of the road.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.506
And I-- My heart just broke.

25:47.506 --> 25:49.508
Really?
'Cause you never wanted a pet before.

25:49.508 --> 25:51.093
It's for the kids.

25:51.093 --> 25:53.178
- Most people get dogs.
- Dogs are a lot of work.

25:53.762 --> 25:55.013
So you're sure about the house?

25:55.013 --> 25:57.307
You don't wanna go by,
check it out one last time?

25:57.307 --> 26:01.979
No, that house is such a hassle.
And Will agreed. He saw it too.

26:02.813 --> 26:04.189
Will was there?

26:04.690 --> 26:07.025
Yeah, he just came by. Fresh set of eyes.

26:09.236 --> 26:11.697
What do you wanna call him?
I was thinking of...

26:13.282 --> 26:15.409
- Gandalf.
- No, I don't like that.

26:15.409 --> 26:16.451
- That's weird.
- Yeah?

26:16.451 --> 26:17.953
What about Jessipa?

26:18.495 --> 26:19.621
You mean Jessica?

26:19.621 --> 26:20.914
No, Jessipa.

26:20.914 --> 26:22.916
- She's...
- Do you even like lizards?

26:23.792 --> 26:25.377
Oh, yeah, I love them.

26:26.587 --> 26:27.671
Love them.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.386
Look at her face.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.847
- I can tell she loves it here.
- Yeah.

26:36.847 --> 26:38.182
I love Jessipa.
