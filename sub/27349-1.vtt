[chuckles softly]

02:05.080 --> 02:06.440
I've heard much worse.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.400
Two years on the front line.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.320
Language.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.240
At first,
I couldn't stomach it.

02:15.320 --> 02:16.720
But then I thought--

02:16.800 --> 02:19.200
[man] They're just words.

02:19.680 --> 02:20.520
Exactly.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.080
They really don't
mean anything.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.480
It's actions that matter,
that's what we're judged on.

02:35.640 --> 02:36.840
Don't you agree?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.720
[thudding]

02:46.480 --> 02:48.840
[man whispers]
Not everyone can be saved.

[thudding]

03:02.520 --> 03:05.320
[train whistling]

03:32.040 --> 03:34.000
We can industrialize
the murder of half

03:34.080 --> 03:37.560
the civilized world, but try
making a decent golf ball.

03:37.640 --> 03:39.640
It's more complicated
than murder.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.840
Hmm.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.800
That's rich coming
from you, Mrs. Christie.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.440
The reason I'm here--

03:45.520 --> 03:47.760
I hate talking
shop on the fairway.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.080
Let's play a few holes.

03:49.160 --> 03:50.480
I hate golf.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.240
Then what are you
doing at a golf course?

03:52.360 --> 03:54.400
Trying to talk
to you, Sir Arthur.

03:54.800 --> 03:56.960
I need help, with my writing.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.640
Well, I'm not going
to talk unless you play.

04:03.720 --> 04:05.000
Assuming you can,
of course.

04:08.000 --> 04:08.960
Yes.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.160
My husband loves golf.

04:14.520 --> 04:15.680
[Agatha clears throat]

04:43.160 --> 04:47.200
That detective,
your Flemish dandy.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.360
You learn to despise him.

04:50.800 --> 04:52.080
Likewise, your readers.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.240
[chuckles]

04:55.240 --> 04:57.120
They'll think your
creation is theirs.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.200
If I can't write anymore,
none of that will matter.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.120
Well, it's probably
for the best.

05:06.960 --> 05:09.840
I'd be far happier if
I never started again.

05:10.440 --> 05:11.920
You'd be much poorer.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.200
[Arthur] Yes.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.720
And everyone would hate you.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.880
That's true.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.040
What if Sherlock
Holmes had never existed?

05:20.520 --> 05:21.480
Hmm.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.080
Good riddance to
an intolerable dick.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.000
Ah! [chuckles softly]

05:40.000 --> 05:43.040
But it's not a character
I'm talking about, it's me.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
All right.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.600
What's the problem?

05:51.240 --> 05:52.360
Why can't you write?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.520
People are solving my murders.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.040
Yes?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.800
They're assuming it's
the most unlikely candidate

06:00.880 --> 06:02.720
and guessing correctly.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.120
[Arthur] And?

06:04.320 --> 06:06.520
Well, what would be the
point in reading 300 pages

06:06.600 --> 06:08.520
of clever insight and
deduction if the audience

06:08.600 --> 06:10.280
knew who the killer
was in the first five?

06:10.360 --> 06:11.200
Ah!

06:12.160 --> 06:14.560
[chuckles softly]
Clever bastards,
aren't they,

06:14.680 --> 06:15.760
your readers.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.480
I'm not sure that
guesswork is clever.

06:18.400 --> 06:21.120
You spend months and months
plotting and sub-plotting.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.200
Layering subterfuge
and sowing misdirection

06:25.680 --> 06:27.080
and the buggers find a shortcut

06:27.160 --> 06:28.840
and chop you off
at the knees, hmm?

06:29.720 --> 06:30.560
Exactly!

06:31.720 --> 06:32.760
But what do I do?

06:34.280 --> 06:35.520
I'd stop writing.

06:35.600 --> 06:36.880
I've only just started.

06:46.480 --> 06:47.840
I've never told anyone.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.160
But I dared to
start writing again.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.440
If you tell anyone,
I'll deny it

06:55.520 --> 06:58.640
and I'll make sure your name
is thoroughly dragged
through the mud.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.960
I understand.

07:00.040 --> 07:00.960
You're not gonna like it.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.760
At this stage,
I'd do anything.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.600
Design a golf course.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.600
That's what I did.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.760
It was like channeling
the hand of God.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.000
You said an hour,
it's been two.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.560
The writing's
gonna have to wait.

08:08.640 --> 08:10.680
How can I make
this fly properly?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.000
I must have an answer.
I can't wait any longer.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.000
Can we talk
about this later?

08:16.240 --> 08:17.600
There's nothing
to talk about.

08:17.840 --> 08:18.920
I want a divorce.

08:19.120 --> 08:20.240
I just need you to agree.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.480
Well, I won't.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.560
[scoffs]

08:23.920 --> 08:24.840
Nancy and I...

08:26.560 --> 08:28.080
You know how sorry we are.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.840
But the quicker this is done,
the less pain for everyone.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.880
Nancy is suffering too.

08:34.159 --> 08:35.480
[knocking on door]

08:37.720 --> 08:40.200
Yes, Carlo,
everything all right?

08:41.799 --> 08:43.159
There's a lady to see you.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.680
Who is it?
I've no appointments.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.080
A Miss Rogers.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.360
She says it's important.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.440
Since when did I
receive fans at home?

08:51.680 --> 08:52.800
She's a nurse.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.400
She can come
back another time.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.520
[Archie] It's okay, Carlo,
it's not your fault.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.320
Why don't you see
what she wants?

08:58.400 --> 09:01.120
If it's anything that can
wait, I'll send her on her way.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.680
God, I hate you.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.040
Then give me a bloody divorce.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.400
-[Agatha] No!
-Why not?

09:08.480 --> 09:09.640
Because I love you.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.240
But I don't love you.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
I know.

09:16.400 --> 09:17.880
[knocking on door]

09:24.560 --> 09:25.720
[door closes]

09:26.360 --> 09:28.040
[Carlo] This is Miss Rogers.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.720
Hello, Mrs. Christie.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.520
Is this a professional visit?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.600
I don't remember any
medical appointments.

09:33.680 --> 09:35.040
No, no, nothing like that.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.600
Then why are you here?

09:38.360 --> 09:39.920
I need your assistance.

09:40.720 --> 09:41.560
How so?

09:43.120 --> 09:45.040
I want you to help
me solve a murder.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.400
What?

09:47.840 --> 09:51.640
Six years ago, my friend
was bludgeoned to
death on a train.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.280
They never caught the killer

09:53.360 --> 09:55.960
and I've been
investigating ever since.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.600
I'm sure you know
the case. It was famous.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.400
She was called Florence.

10:00.720 --> 10:02.640
She was Nurse
Nightingale's god-daughter.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.600
I'm sorry, Miss Rogers,
but whatever fantasy

10:04.680 --> 10:06.960
you've been indulging,
I'm a writer,
not a detective.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.520
Let me just
outline the details.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.880
It's a mystery, like
one of your books.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.200
No doubt, Miss
Rogers, but still,

10:12.280 --> 10:14.280
there are a hundred
reasons why I can't.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.760
[door opens]

10:17.720 --> 10:19.080
Please could you
see Miss Rogers out,

10:19.160 --> 10:20.480
I must return to my work.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.160
Please! I've nowhere
else to turn.
She deserves justice.

10:29.480 --> 10:30.720
[sighing]

10:40.360 --> 10:42.520
[breathing heavily]

10:43.160 --> 10:45.320
Miss Rogers insisted
on leaving this.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.520
I tried to...

10:55.160 --> 10:56.000
Thank you.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.920
[Carlo] You'll
find a way through.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.400
I'm not sure that I will.

11:05.640 --> 11:07.240
Shall I type the manuscript?

11:07.640 --> 11:09.240
Seeing it printed
always helps you.

11:09.520 --> 11:10.520
No, not this time.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.320
A read through perhaps?

11:13.560 --> 11:14.400
A field trip?

11:14.520 --> 11:15.440
[sighs]

11:16.280 --> 11:17.320
I'll do anything to help.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.560
I know and I'm very grateful.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.560
But I think I need to
see a professional.

11:29.280 --> 11:30.240
Mrs. Christie?

11:30.320 --> 11:31.800
Sir Hugh will see you know.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.080
[Agatha] Thank you.

11:40.600 --> 11:41.600
Mrs. Christie.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.800
I am flattered you should turn
to me for research purposes.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.200
So many writers ride roughshod
over their source material.

11:49.320 --> 11:50.840
I'm very keen to understand

11:50.920 --> 11:52.920
the emotional dynamics
of course design.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.120
-You mean--
-[Agatha] Thank you.

11:56.600 --> 12:01.680
How one would go
about murdering someone
on a golf course.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.800
No, what makes one enjoy
playing a round of golf?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.120
As an alibi.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.960
How could one be playing
golf, but not playing golf.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.560
No, this has nothing
to do with my writing.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.440
I want to design a golf course.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.840
I see.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.400
-Really?
-Yes.

12:24.920 --> 12:28.040
Well, in that case,

12:28.240 --> 12:30.280
I'm afraid my
answer's quite short.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.640
You can't.

12:33.360 --> 12:34.200
Excuse me?

12:34.960 --> 12:36.440
There isn't a golf club I know

12:36.520 --> 12:38.760
that would commission
a design from a woman.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.720
I understand there has
been a trend of late

12:42.800 --> 12:44.280
for ladies to golf.

12:45.040 --> 12:48.560
But really, the sheer
complexity of a designer's task

12:48.640 --> 12:51.680
is beyond the
capabilities of a woman,

12:51.960 --> 12:54.400
no matter how capable
that woman is.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.800
[chuckles] I see.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.640
I hadn't realized.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.480
But thinking about it.
How could I have
been so stupid?

13:04.440 --> 13:07.880
[chuckles] Imagine a woman
being able to design
the preamble

13:07.960 --> 13:09.880
to putting something
small in a hole.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.280
A woman might just present
the hole and have done,
[chuckles]

13:14.360 --> 13:16.160
and where would be the
fun in that. [laughs]

13:16.240 --> 13:18.440
There'd be nothing
to groom for a start.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.000
But thank you for your time.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.640
It's been pointless.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.480
[door closes]

13:41.800 --> 13:44.120
Mommy, will you
play hide-and-seek?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.480
[Agatha] Yes, dear.

13:45.640 --> 13:47.240
What are you doing?

13:47.920 --> 13:49.080
Working.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.440
That's not work.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.240
Where's Carlo?

13:53.320 --> 13:54.440
She's hiding.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.120
Shouldn't you find her?

13:57.760 --> 13:59.280
How long will she hide for?

14:00.680 --> 14:02.520
[Agatha] I imagine
until you find her.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.720
But what if I don't find her?

14:06.960 --> 14:07.800
She'll starve.

14:08.560 --> 14:09.480
Really?

14:09.560 --> 14:10.560
Carlo.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.400
[laughing]

14:46.840 --> 14:47.960
Rosalind.

14:48.560 --> 14:49.960
I'm coming.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.160
Ready or not.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.800
"And who is to
blame for all this?

15:01.480 --> 15:04.040
Nobody is to blame
except the robots.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.520
No, we are to blame,
for our own selfish ends

15:07.600 --> 15:09.400
for profit, for progress.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.440
We have destroyed mankind."

16:42.280 --> 16:43.480
Miss Rogers.

16:43.960 --> 16:45.160
[Mabel] Thank you.

16:45.360 --> 16:47.520
You don't know how
much this means.
Come in.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.240
I haven't done anything yet.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.600
But you're here.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.840
You're going to help.

16:51.920 --> 16:52.800
I have some questions.

16:52.880 --> 16:54.240
Oh, of course, anything.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.200
Come through.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.520
I think her cousin killed her.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.000
He's called Randolph.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.319
He inherited the trust fund.

17:12.400 --> 17:14.400
At first, I thought it
might be her brother,

17:14.480 --> 17:15.880
but he was in
America at the time.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.680
He took back the pendant
Florence gave me.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.760
Randolph hates me.

17:20.839 --> 17:23.160
Florence says so
in her diaries.
I'll show you.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.400
You have her diaries?

17:24.480 --> 17:25.319
[Mabel] Of course.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.680
He'd never even met me.

17:30.360 --> 17:31.680
Um...

17:32.200 --> 17:35.960
Zaki Hanachi, one of
Florence's waifs and strays.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.800
He came to see her two weeks
before she was murdered.

17:38.920 --> 17:40.120
He wouldn't leave her alone.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.560
He wanted money, I'm sure.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.240
-Florence had money?
-Oh, yes.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.360
The police thought it
was a robbery gone wrong.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.600
There was a boxer,
but really he's a thief.

17:50.680 --> 17:51.920
Travis Pickford.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.360
Nasty piece of work.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.880
He was arrested, but they
said he didn't do it.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.240
His gun was covered in blood.

17:59.320 --> 18:02.680
And then there's
the nurse, Daphne.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.480
Florence's report would have
seen her barred from nursing.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.560
That boy would have died.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.040
It has to be one of them.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.080
[stutters] I just
don't know which one.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.280
[Agatha] Mabel.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.480
[Mabel] Yes.

18:15.640 --> 18:16.720
Is that Florence?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.160
[Mabel] Yes.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.520
Yes, it is.

18:25.680 --> 18:28.200
[Mabel crying]

18:31.080 --> 18:34.600
Look, [stutters] I know
how this must look.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.640
You were right, what you
said when I came to see you.

18:38.720 --> 18:39.840
This is a fantasy.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.480
But you've got to believe me.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.680
Florence wasn't
killed by a stranger,

18:45.960 --> 18:47.880
she was murdered for a reason.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.680
Let's start at the beginning.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.760
[train whistling]

19:08.080 --> 19:09.960
Florence always
took a corner seat

19:10.040 --> 19:12.040
in the last carriage
facing forwards.

19:13.400 --> 19:14.840
She didn't like trains.

19:15.800 --> 19:19.400
A friend of hers died in
Italy, suffocated in a tunnel.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.160
Bad coal, I think.

19:22.920 --> 19:26.080
The day she was attacked,
I found her a seat

19:26.160 --> 19:28.400
in the compartment next
door, but a woman told us

19:28.480 --> 19:29.920
it was taken, so
we came in here.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.200
[Agatha] What woman?

19:31.760 --> 19:32.960
I don't remember.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.680
And the man in the brown suit?

19:35.760 --> 19:38.400
He got on just
before the train left.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.880
But I don't remember his face.

19:41.280 --> 19:44.080
The police were convinced
he was the killer.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.320
If only I could give
them a description.

19:46.560 --> 19:47.760
You're sure it was a man?

19:47.840 --> 19:48.680
Yes.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.680
I mean,
he looked like a man.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.440
Did Florence recognize him?

19:56.840 --> 19:58.120
God, I can't remember.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.920
You must try.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.280
Murdering someone is easier
if you know their routine.

20:16.680 --> 20:18.600
Who knew about
Florence's train habits?

20:19.920 --> 20:21.360
Oh, everyone.

20:21.440 --> 20:24.480
I mean, she wasn't
embarrassed about her fears.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.040
She'd always make a
point of explaining it.

20:28.440 --> 20:32.120
Florence didn't believe
in pretending to be
something she wasn't.

20:35.760 --> 20:37.920
This is the tunnel
where it happened.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.320
That's what the
police thought.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.200
Seems harder to kill someone

20:43.280 --> 20:44.880
when you can't see
them very well.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.520
It took her four days to die.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.680
Bits of skull
stuck in her brain.

20:54.000 --> 20:58.200
Everyone saying it was
all right that she didn't
feel anything.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.320
But I'd seen it too many times
before with the soldiers.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.240
The mind finds a way through.

21:11.240 --> 21:15.800
She knew that she was broken,
she knew that she was dying,

21:18.800 --> 21:20.800
but she also knew
that I was there.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.400
And that I loved her.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.400
How long were you together?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.480
Twenty-six years.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.920
That's 15 more
than Archie and I.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.040
I'm very sorry.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.200
[train whistling]

22:03.400 --> 22:06.040
[Mabel] This is where the
person in her carriage got off.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.080
The man in the brown suit?

22:07.160 --> 22:09.920
Yes, but witnesses
described someone else.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.960
Heavier built and
different clothes.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.800
And the man you saw
getting in the compartment

22:13.880 --> 22:15.200
with Florence had
nothing with him.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.040
He couldn't have been
concealing a disguise?

22:17.120 --> 22:19.480
It was a cold day, but
he had no coat or bag.

22:19.560 --> 22:21.000
I remember that.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.760
So, one man got in the
compartment with Florence

22:23.840 --> 22:24.960
and another man got out.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.680
Yes, that's right.

22:26.760 --> 22:27.800
Impossible.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.240
Who was Florence visiting?

22:29.320 --> 22:30.560
Mrs. Pamela Rose.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.960
Her son James died in France

22:33.040 --> 22:34.680
and Florence tended to him.

22:34.760 --> 22:35.800
What happened?

22:35.880 --> 22:39.040
Ah, he was shot after
armistice by some madman

22:39.120 --> 22:41.720
who should've been in
front of a firing squad.

22:41.800 --> 22:43.720
Could she have blamed
Florence for not saving him?

22:43.800 --> 22:46.880
Oh, no, he was dying by
the time he got to Florence.

22:46.960 --> 22:49.000
All she could do was
make him comfortable.

22:49.960 --> 22:51.560
Had you met Mrs. Rose?

22:51.680 --> 22:53.800
This would've been
their first meeting.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.640
She'd only just
discovered that Florence
had helped her son.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.480
She wanted to hear
about his last few days.

22:58.560 --> 23:00.240
So she knew the
train Florence was on.

23:00.320 --> 23:02.440
Oh, she was to collect
her from the station.

23:03.240 --> 23:04.200
But you can't think--

23:04.280 --> 23:05.400
She's a suspect.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.840
Same is true for anyone who
knew what train she was on.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.000
So, that makes five.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.160
Well, unless you count me.
[chuckles]

23:31.040 --> 23:33.320
Don't worry, I'm not
going to berate you.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.400
I think it's time for a truce.

23:35.640 --> 23:36.480
You do?

23:39.240 --> 23:41.000
This is a course
I'd like to play.

23:42.040 --> 23:43.200
Where did you get this?

23:44.840 --> 23:46.120
I made it.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.920
[Archie] Bollocks!
You hate golf.

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I hate playing it.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.080
I don't understand.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.040
[Agatha] I enjoyed
the challenge.

23:58.600 --> 23:59.640
You made this for me.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.000
No, I didn't.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.200
You're a terrible liar.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.560
But look, I was
supposed to be going
to a Suicide Club reunion.

24:09.640 --> 24:10.880
Why don't I forego an evening

24:10.960 --> 24:14.560
of exaggerated flying
heroics and stay here?

24:15.200 --> 24:16.560
We can look at this together.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.960
I've already seen a couple
of small improvements.

24:21.040 --> 24:24.440
With a bit of work, we could
make this something special.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.280
You really like it?

24:29.760 --> 24:32.280
Yes, it's fabulous.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.840
That means a lot.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.480
But I really must be
getting back to my work.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.880
[door slamming]

25:22.120 --> 25:23.360
Anything else, Mrs. Christie?

25:23.440 --> 25:25.280
No, thank you, that's lovely.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
[Mr. Todd] I haven't seen
Florence in years.

26:02.840 --> 26:03.840
How is she?

26:05.680 --> 26:07.600
She died, I'm afraid.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.640
[Mr. Todd]
Oh, that's terrible.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.120
I'm surprised Mr.
and Mrs. Williams
didn't tell me about it.

26:14.760 --> 26:17.000
But then again,
maybe they did.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.880
My memory's not what it was.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.800
I'm borrowing the house
for a sort of memorial.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.360
They were very
fond of Florence.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.400
Florence was the only
good person I ever met.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.760
Mmm-hmm.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.520
It's been a while
since the family

26:49.600 --> 26:51.320
have been in the country.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.360
I'm afraid I'm finding it
harder to keep on top of it.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.600
[Mabel] Hmm.

26:55.760 --> 26:58.000
I hope your guests don't
mind a bit of mess.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.120
Oh, dear.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.640
I must have forgotten
to get this cleared.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.120
Don't you worry, miss,
I'll get right on it.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.840
You won't forget to collect
our guests from the station.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.200
All the important
things gets written down.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.760
Rosalind, dear.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.120
Rosalind?

28:06.400 --> 28:08.200
I'm going away
for a little bit.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.480
I need to solve a murder.

28:15.080 --> 28:16.920
I have to pretend
to be someone else.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.480
What color is a bunker?

28:20.560 --> 28:21.680
[Agatha] Yellow.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.120
Carlo will take you
to see your father.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.760
[Rosalind]
Will Nancy be there?

28:29.200 --> 28:30.280
I expect so.

28:30.560 --> 28:31.840
Nancy's pretty.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.280
My great-aunt told me

28:36.360 --> 28:38.640
it's better to be
pretty than clever.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.240
Was she pretty?

28:40.320 --> 28:41.640
She was clever.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.760
Can I meet her?

28:42.840 --> 28:44.200
She died.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.600
Long time ago.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.680
It's better to be
alive, than dead.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.200
That's right.

28:50.680 --> 28:52.560
Do you have a
disguise, can I see it?

28:53.320 --> 28:54.440
When I get back.

29:00.080 --> 29:01.560
Are you going somewhere?

29:09.000 --> 29:11.280
When I finish this, I'm
going to draw a picture of me

29:11.360 --> 29:12.960
so you always know where I am.

29:20.640 --> 29:22.040
Here you go,
Mrs. Westmacott.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.120
Thank you.

29:24.200 --> 29:26.440
Is there anything else?

29:26.760 --> 29:27.880
Some stamps perhaps?

29:29.880 --> 29:32.680
Is it true there's a writer
of detective novels
who lives nearby?

29:33.280 --> 29:35.240
Yes, Mrs. Christie.

29:35.320 --> 29:36.680
She's famous.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.120
Are her novels any good?

29:39.160 --> 29:43.560
Not as good as Stevenson,
but better than Conan-Doyle.

29:45.480 --> 29:46.520
Thank you.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.960
Florence here
will look after ya.

30:07.200 --> 30:09.000
I was beginning to think
you changed your mind.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.360
What a terrible journey!

30:10.440 --> 30:11.920
The car broke,
the train got stuck.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.360
I spent last night in what
I think was a brothel.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.480
Are they here?

30:15.560 --> 30:17.240
Yes, and they started
to talk to one another.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.760
I'm terrified they'll
make a connection.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.800
Well then, better get to it.
Any surprises?

30:20.880 --> 30:22.520
Miss Miller has brought
her father with her,

30:22.600 --> 30:24.200
or should I say,
he's decided to come.

30:24.280 --> 30:26.280
I don't think his
motivation is paternal.

30:26.360 --> 30:28.040
Mrs. Rose is with
her son Franklin.

30:28.120 --> 30:31.360
I get the impression
he's not completely
taken in by our lies.

30:31.440 --> 30:34.280
Mr. Hanachi is so nervous,
I'm wondering if it's an act.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.880
And Mr. Pickford looks capable
of just about anything.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.040
Any other surprises?

30:39.120 --> 30:40.320
Their luggage is missing.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.000
-Oh, and...
-What?

30:43.080 --> 30:44.200
What is it?

30:47.720 --> 30:49.240
[gasping] Oh, God.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.400
I'm not missing, I've
only been gone 48 hours.

30:54.040 --> 30:56.680
We'll have to try
and keep our suspects
away from the newspapers.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.320
At least there
isn't a picture.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.560
[Randolph] Mrs. Westmacott?

31:02.840 --> 31:05.120
Assuming you are
Mrs. Westmacott.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.320
Yes, that's correct.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.200
I must apologize for the delay.

31:09.280 --> 31:11.280
I'm sure you all have
a lot of questions.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.880
[Randolph] Why are we
being kept in the dark?

31:12.960 --> 31:13.920
Are you the secretary?

31:14.000 --> 31:15.800
-When do we get our money?
-Who's in charge?

31:15.880 --> 31:16.960
Where's the lawyer?

31:28.800 --> 31:29.720
Good morning.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.600
My name is Mary Westmacott.

31:31.680 --> 31:34.400
I am the representative of
Messieurs Kant, Hope, Delaney.

31:34.720 --> 31:35.840
We thought you might
want to change that

31:35.920 --> 31:38.960
to "Can't Help Delay
Me." [laughing]

31:42.120 --> 31:45.480
Firstly, I would like to
reinforce what was stated
in the letters you were sent.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.360
No one is under any
compulsion to stay.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.680
Our firm has no legal
power or responsibility

31:50.760 --> 31:52.080
other than that conferred on us

31:52.160 --> 31:53.960
as executors of
Mr. Dower's will.

31:55.480 --> 32:00.000
Mr. Dower's legacy is
valued at £186,000.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.080
This total, minus our
fees, is to be distributed

32:03.160 --> 32:06.040
proportionately amongst
you, his relatives.

32:06.120 --> 32:09.520
Tracing Mr. Dower's bloodline
has been very difficult.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.840
The purpose of calling
you here is twofold.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.880
To check our findings
regarding your lineage,

32:13.960 --> 32:16.640
and to satisfy a couple
of specific conditions
of the will.

32:16.880 --> 32:18.760
We weren't told
about any conditions.

32:18.840 --> 32:21.680
[Agatha] No, these are matters
to be discussed privately.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.320
There is a good deal of work
to be done and I have no wish

32:24.400 --> 32:26.680
to increase your fees
through wasted time.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.560
If anyone is unhappy
with these arrangements

32:28.640 --> 32:31.080
or feels they no longer wish
to engage in this process,

32:31.160 --> 32:32.600
now is the time to let me know.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.560
Given my late arrival,

32:39.640 --> 32:41.480
I won't start formal
interviews until the morning.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.320
Prior to that, are
there any questions

32:43.400 --> 32:45.040
which require an
immediate answer?

32:46.400 --> 32:47.760
Yes?

32:47.960 --> 32:50.040
Do you know where
my suitcase is?

32:50.120 --> 32:52.480
No, Mr. Hanachi, luggage
is not my responsibility.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.000
It's like Christmas
with the family.

33:21.120 --> 33:22.880
Only without anything to drink.

33:28.600 --> 33:30.280
Entrapped in a festive morgue.

33:31.280 --> 33:35.520
You know what?
You're absolutely right,
we are family.

33:36.080 --> 33:37.200
We're related.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.280
Yeah, well, go
back far enough,

33:40.360 --> 33:41.560
I'm related to the king.

33:42.640 --> 33:43.720
Or a shoe shiner.

33:53.040 --> 33:55.720
Mr. Hanachi, would
I be right in thinking

33:55.800 --> 33:57.080
you served in the war?

33:58.640 --> 33:59.600
How did you know?

33:59.680 --> 34:01.800
My other son fought at Verdun.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.680
Are you Algerian
or perhaps Moroccan?

34:07.520 --> 34:08.719
I'm French.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.239
Born in Constantine.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.280
Your English is excellent.

34:16.440 --> 34:17.760
I was a translator.

34:17.920 --> 34:18.800
Oh.

34:20.639 --> 34:21.840
As I remember it,
howitzer sounds

34:21.920 --> 34:24.280
-the same in English
as in French.
-[Pamela chuckles]

34:24.360 --> 34:25.440
You fought?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.800
No, I was a chaplain.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.840
Ha! I knew it.

34:28.920 --> 34:31.080
I had the feeling we were
in the presence of God

34:31.159 --> 34:32.440
ever since I got here.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.120
[Daphne] How funny to think
we're all related.

34:37.679 --> 34:39.840
I hardly know anyone
on my mother's side.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.760
When she died, there was
just her half-sister.

34:42.920 --> 34:44.920
Imagine all this family
I never knew I had.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.040
[scoffs]

34:46.960 --> 34:48.480
How did you track us all down?

34:48.560 --> 34:50.360
It was done by
a specialist firm.

34:50.440 --> 34:52.679
With a pin in a toy phone
book by the looks of it.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.560
[Randolph] Do feel free
to take your leave.

34:54.639 --> 34:56.320
A quarter share is preferable.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.280
My daughter will get hers.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.840
Your letter stated that
Mr. Dower spent most
of his life in America.

35:06.160 --> 35:07.360
What was his line of work?

35:07.440 --> 35:08.920
He sold cars.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.080
All that money from cars.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.200
I'm in the wrong business.

35:12.280 --> 35:14.040
What is your
business, Mr. Pickford?

35:14.120 --> 35:15.160
Removals.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.160
Little like you, Reverend.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.240
I no longer serve.

35:18.440 --> 35:19.920
-[Travis] God or country?
-Both.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.120
Shame, I could've
used your help.

35:23.560 --> 35:25.240
What happened to
change your mind?

35:26.120 --> 35:27.520
I stopped believing in either.

35:28.040 --> 35:29.680
Surely you don't mean that?

35:32.400 --> 35:33.960
What did you do
during the war?

35:35.080 --> 35:36.480
Administration.

35:36.560 --> 35:37.640
Mmm-hmm.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.440
You never saw the trenches.

35:40.600 --> 35:43.160
I read a great
deal concerning them.

35:43.240 --> 35:47.080
A million crimes
enabled by my country

35:47.760 --> 35:49.560
unpunished by my God.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.240
[door opens]

35:54.240 --> 35:56.440
Ah, any sign of our trunks?

35:56.520 --> 35:58.960
Yes, sir, I'm afraid they
went back to the station,

35:59.040 --> 36:01.160
but they'll be with you
again in the morning.

36:01.360 --> 36:04.640
Well, I suppose I should
thank God for that.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.320
[Wade] What time
do the interviews
start in the morning?

36:09.560 --> 36:10.560
10:00 a.m.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.920
Perhaps you and your daughter
would like to go first?

36:13.280 --> 36:14.360
Yes.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.400
How much of our inheritance
is locked in this pile?

36:21.480 --> 36:22.680
None of it.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.600
Mr. Dower's gift to his
relatives is a cash asset.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.200
And a good job too.

36:27.760 --> 36:29.680
This castle's built of paper.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.520
Spent last night listening
to the Frenchman snore.

36:34.160 --> 36:36.880
So, we're not inheriting
the whole estate.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.240
No. The bulk of it
is being handled

36:39.320 --> 36:41.520
by Mr. Dower's American
representatives.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.320
[Randolph] I thought that
might be the case.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.080
There's a great deal
more at stake here

36:45.160 --> 36:47.080
than a couple of hundred
thousand, isn't there?

36:48.240 --> 36:52.040
When all's said and done, we
might be due a bigger share.

36:53.280 --> 36:54.880
A much bigger share.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.040
We're safe, they're
in their rooms.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.400
Oh, that greedy bastard.

37:11.760 --> 37:13.920
He's already got the trust
he inherited from Florence.

37:14.240 --> 37:15.920
Imagine being offered
all that money

37:16.000 --> 37:18.440
and his first thought
is to want more.

37:18.680 --> 37:19.880
It doesn't make him a killer.

37:19.960 --> 37:20.880
He's watching us.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.440
-I know.
-He's no fool.

37:22.520 --> 37:24.200
Money makes most
people foolish.

37:24.960 --> 37:27.080
Wade's a bastard too.

37:27.480 --> 37:29.360
Mr. Hanachi
certainly thinks so.

37:29.440 --> 37:30.720
His poor daughter.

37:31.120 --> 37:34.000
Imagine living
with such a brute.

37:34.680 --> 37:37.160
His poor daughter is
one of our suspects.

37:37.360 --> 37:38.800
Pamela seems nice.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.000
Maybe she did it.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.840
How you going to
conduct the interviews?

37:42.920 --> 37:44.480
By keeping their minds
on the inheritance.

37:44.560 --> 37:45.760
What did you find
in their luggage?

37:45.840 --> 37:48.800
Hmm, come with me.

37:54.160 --> 37:59.920
So, um, Wade has a cleaning kit
for a pistol, but no pistol.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.840
Daphne has enough
make-up to put on a show.

38:05.640 --> 38:09.400
Uh, Pamela and Franklin's
cases are unremarkable.

38:09.480 --> 38:11.760
Couple of books,
copy of the Bible.

38:12.880 --> 38:17.640
Zaki's case has a few
clothes and a tin of coffee.

38:19.040 --> 38:23.160
Uh, Travis has a doctor's
case which is empty.

38:26.680 --> 38:28.080
And Randolph?

38:29.320 --> 38:30.720
Smut.

38:31.160 --> 38:32.520
And not the artistic kind.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.920
Could Florence really
have ended Daphne's career?

38:37.000 --> 38:40.640
Oh, yes. Her report
would have seen Daphne
barred from nursing,

38:40.720 --> 38:42.400
but she was killed before
she could write it.

38:42.480 --> 38:45.040
But that girl's scared
of her own shadow.

38:45.200 --> 38:48.000
Imagine Daphne
killing in cold blood.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.920
-Will this take long?
-[Agatha] I hope not.

39:00.680 --> 39:01.960
[Agatha clears throat]

39:03.880 --> 39:05.640
Your mother's maiden
name was Stone.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.360
She died on June 24th, 1922.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.680
You already know that.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.440
[Agatha] Do you have
the death certificate?

39:13.880 --> 39:16.920
Everything is exactly as
stated in my daughter's letter.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.360
Your mother's father,
Joshua Stone,
lived in Richmond.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.760
Her grandfather,
William Stone,
died in Aberdeen.

39:23.840 --> 39:25.280
I don't see how
this is going--

39:25.360 --> 39:27.480
The man found in our
searches was James Stone,

39:27.560 --> 39:29.760
not William Stone.
It's a different person.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.520
Well, clearly there's
been a mistake.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.320
William was probably
a middle name.

39:34.400 --> 39:36.000
It was definitely William.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.880
My mother used to tell
me stories about him.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.480
He was a cavalry trooper,
he fought at Waterloo.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.160
Well, you can't take
my wife's word for it.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.640
She was a drunk.

39:44.880 --> 39:49.160
If I remember correctly,
his name was
James William Stone.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.480
Yes, that's it.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.440
Well, that would
be unfortunate.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.600
Why?

39:59.680 --> 40:01.160
Because I've
discovered a mistake.

40:01.360 --> 40:05.360
James Stone was the
half-brother of Mr. Dower's
great uncle, Andrew Dower.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.560
William Stone was
a second cousin.

40:07.640 --> 40:09.560
If Daphne is correct that
her great-grandfather

40:09.640 --> 40:14.440
is William Stone,
she is the only surviving
direct descendant of Mr. Dower.

40:15.240 --> 40:19.320
I'll have to check no
similar mistake has been made
in regards his other relatives,

40:19.400 --> 40:22.160
but if I might, Daphne
would inherit the majority

40:22.240 --> 40:24.760
of Mr. Dower's estate with
a much smaller proportion

40:24.840 --> 40:26.600
going to his
other antecedents.

40:28.080 --> 40:30.040
Daphne's bound to be right.

40:30.120 --> 40:31.520
She always is.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.840
I'm no good with these things.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.720
Once removed, twice removed.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.200
It's all Greek to me.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.920
However, before
we can progress,

40:38.000 --> 40:39.600
there's something
I need to establish.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.400
Of course. Anything.

40:42.080 --> 40:44.600
You finished your nurses
training in February 1920.

40:44.840 --> 40:45.720
Yes.

40:45.800 --> 40:46.880
Shortly after completing it,

40:46.960 --> 40:48.920
you went in front of the
regional superintendent.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.760
They were looking into a
complaint serious enough

40:50.840 --> 40:52.200
to have you removed
as a Queen's nurse.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.000
What in God's name has
that got to do with this?

40:54.080 --> 40:57.320
As I said yesterday, there
are certain conditions
of the will that must be met.

40:57.560 --> 40:58.880
She was exonerated.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.480
No evidence against her.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.960
Just unfounded allegations
by a bull dagger,

41:03.040 --> 41:04.200
who got what she deserved.

41:09.480 --> 41:11.640
Look, I don't mean to
fly off the handle.

41:11.720 --> 41:15.320
It's just, it was a very
unpleasant time
for my daughter.

41:16.400 --> 41:18.320
That woman almost
ruined her life.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.240
Miss Miller?

41:22.760 --> 41:24.080
I was cleared.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.840
[Agatha] And the
allegations were incorrect?

41:26.920 --> 41:27.760
Yes.

41:30.760 --> 41:32.920
Then I have everything
I need to proceed.

41:33.920 --> 41:35.840
I'll explain the
situation to the others.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.120
Thank you.

41:37.320 --> 41:38.520
Come on, darling.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.280
[Agatha] Is there
something else?

41:42.360 --> 41:43.960
[Wade] There's a line
of people outside

41:44.040 --> 41:45.920
who'll be none too pleased
about the turn of events.

41:46.160 --> 41:47.960
Let's not waste
any more of their time.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.920
Mrs. Westmacott, who do
you want to talk to next?

42:03.120 --> 42:05.240
I'm afraid there's been
a change of circumstances.

42:06.560 --> 42:07.680
What does that mean?

42:09.880 --> 42:12.320
And why are you grinning
like a Cheshire cat?

42:12.400 --> 42:14.720
What does that man got
to be so happy about?

42:14.800 --> 42:16.960
As I understand it,
he's not even a relative.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.680
Not of yours, thank God.

42:19.880 --> 42:21.800
We're related where it counts.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.080
What's he talking about?

42:30.440 --> 42:33.440
You told them
most of the money's
going to Daphne!

42:33.520 --> 42:34.680
What if they just leave?

42:34.760 --> 42:37.080
They were angry, but some
money is better than no money.

42:37.520 --> 42:40.800
But I don't understand.
I mean, why take such a risk?

42:40.880 --> 42:42.680
Because Wade killed Florence.

42:46.320 --> 42:49.040
You think he killed her to
save his daughter's career?

42:49.120 --> 42:50.400
But there's no evidence.

42:50.480 --> 42:51.520
We'll find it.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.920
It's ironic. I can't
write at the moment

42:54.000 --> 42:56.160
because I'm so worried about
always making my murderer

42:56.240 --> 42:57.760
the most unlikely suspect.

42:57.840 --> 43:01.120
Talk about unlikely,
Wade wasn't even
supposed to be here.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.440
But there's no connection
to any other aspect
of the murder.

43:04.520 --> 43:06.200
We just need to keep digging.

43:07.240 --> 43:10.040
There must be something here
that links him to the crime.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.040
See if you can find it.

43:12.120 --> 43:13.600
I'm going to talk to him again.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.800
He'll help us if he thinks
it's going to make him rich.

43:17.680 --> 43:18.880
What if you're wrong?

43:19.320 --> 43:20.440
I'm not.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.480
But we have to find the proof
before we can set a trap.

43:43.760 --> 43:44.720
You looking for someone?

43:44.800 --> 43:45.960
Mr. Miller.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.360
Last I saw,
he was on the terrace.

43:47.920 --> 43:50.720
Uh, who represents Mr. Dower
in the United States?

43:50.800 --> 43:52.360
[gunshot popping]

43:53.120 --> 43:54.040
Was that a gunshot?

43:54.120 --> 43:55.760
Gunshots don't
sound like that.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.520
Travis probably
found some champagne.

43:58.760 --> 44:00.640
I'm afraid I have some
rather pressing business.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.320
[glass breaking and thudding]

44:08.720 --> 44:09.760
It's Wade.

44:12.320 --> 44:14.000
Someone tried to kill Daphne.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.400
How?

44:27.480 --> 44:28.840
Daphne said she
was in her room.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.840
The door opened
and a pistol was
pointed at her.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.320
Wade jumped in
front of the bullet,

44:33.400 --> 44:35.520
stumbled backwards and
fell through the window.

44:35.800 --> 44:38.480
Turns out that
deeply unpleasant man
was a bit of a hero.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.720
[Mabel] Has anyone checked
for signs of life?

44:49.000 --> 44:51.240
He looks like all the
other dead people I've seen.

44:52.360 --> 44:53.440
Are you a nurse?

44:54.440 --> 44:56.840
Oh, no, I used to
work in a hospital.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.680
You're right, he's dead.

45:01.440 --> 45:02.760
I think.

45:05.480 --> 45:06.720
It must have been a big gun.

45:09.160 --> 45:10.360
I'll call the police.

45:12.320 --> 45:13.520
[Randolph] Where's Travis?

45:13.720 --> 45:15.480
I wouldn't put it past
him to kill someone

45:15.560 --> 45:16.960
for a bigger share of the pot.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.280
Mabel, when you get back,
could you help Daphne?

45:20.360 --> 45:22.280
She has a nasty
cut from the glass.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.320
Yeah.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.520
Poor man was trying
to get dressed.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.920
Bit of food will do you good.

45:49.360 --> 45:50.680
Believe me, I know.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.160
Thank you.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.520
I couldn't bear
to be on my own.

46:01.080 --> 46:03.400
Never talk to the police
on an empty stomach.

46:03.720 --> 46:04.720
Is that so?

46:04.800 --> 46:05.880
[Travis] Not really.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.280
Never talk to the
police, full stop.

46:08.360 --> 46:10.360
You take that woman writer
that's topped herself.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.920
If everyone in her books
had kept their mouth shut,

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
that Poirot couldn't
catch a cold.

46:15.080 --> 46:16.520
You mean Agatha Christie.

46:16.760 --> 46:18.920
[Travis] Golden rule,
like my cousin says.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.320
Says what?

46:20.960 --> 46:22.640
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

46:28.280 --> 46:29.720
She's a very good writer.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.880
[Randolph]
But rather predictable.

46:32.960 --> 46:35.840
I read the
Murder of Peter Ackroyd,

46:36.400 --> 46:38.600
guessed the end
within a few pages.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.000
It's easy when you know how.

46:40.080 --> 46:41.440
[Agatha] Roger.

46:41.920 --> 46:42.960
Excuse me.

46:44.560 --> 46:46.000
Roger Ackroyd.

46:46.080 --> 46:48.360
[chuckles] I'm pretty sure
it was Peter.

46:50.120 --> 46:52.960
So, how we gonna guess
who knocked off Wade?

46:53.200 --> 46:55.520
No offense, but none of you lot
look like the killing type.

46:55.600 --> 46:57.160
[Randolph] That's how it is
in her books.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.000
The last person
you'd ever suspect.

47:00.040 --> 47:02.400
If Mrs. Christie
were writing this,

47:03.560 --> 47:05.480
Mrs. Westmacott
would be guilty.

47:05.560 --> 47:08.360
More like that
caretaker, Mr. Todd.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.120
Police can talk to him
all they like. He'll have
forgotten he did it.

47:11.200 --> 47:12.520
[laughing]

47:12.920 --> 47:15.520
Murder isn't like
a detective novel.

47:15.600 --> 47:16.640
Of course.

47:18.960 --> 47:19.960
Sorry.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.240
Your father was a brave man.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.600
He had his faults.

47:30.320 --> 47:33.080
But after my mother
died, he came home
to look after me.

47:34.320 --> 47:35.520
He was abroad.

47:37.200 --> 47:40.560
In New York, left in June '16.

47:41.800 --> 47:44.200
I didn't see him for six years.

47:44.520 --> 47:47.080
So many of my friends lost
their fathers in the war,

47:47.360 --> 47:50.440
I suppose
I should be grateful

47:51.240 --> 47:53.080
for the years that I had.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.280
[crying]

47:57.960 --> 48:00.000
[Zaki] Someone tried
to kill Miss Miller.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.800
Until the police get here,

48:01.880 --> 48:03.640
I will keep watch
outside her room.

48:04.040 --> 48:05.920
[Travis] Oh, very brave.

48:06.280 --> 48:07.480
You sure you're French?

48:08.400 --> 48:10.360
[Pamela]
It's very kind, Mr. Hanachi.

48:10.440 --> 48:11.880
Our room is next door.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.640
Franklin and I will be
sure to look after you.

48:16.680 --> 48:17.840
It will be reassuring

48:17.920 --> 48:20.480
to have a man who
served to keep watch.

48:21.120 --> 48:23.080
I served my country.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.280
Served them sugar,
meat, cigarettes. [chuckles]

48:27.360 --> 48:28.960
Much more of a
service than donating

48:29.040 --> 48:30.840
my bollocks to
French agriculture.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.480
[knocking]

48:35.000 --> 48:36.920
The police will
be here shortly.

48:37.320 --> 48:40.520
I've been asked to request
that no one leaves.

48:40.920 --> 48:42.240
Even if I did kill him,

48:43.400 --> 48:45.360
I'm not leaving
till I get my money.

48:50.840 --> 48:52.360
I said I was cleaning.
We don't have long.

48:52.440 --> 48:55.040
It couldn't have been Wade.
He was in New York.

48:55.520 --> 48:57.640
We got an innocent man killed.

48:57.800 --> 48:59.120
I don't think he was innocent.

48:59.200 --> 49:01.360
That's hardly the point.
They were our lies.

49:01.880 --> 49:03.600
But someone else's bullet.

49:03.720 --> 49:05.600
That doesn't make
any difference.

49:07.480 --> 49:09.720
I know what it's
like to kill by proxy.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.320
This isn't it.

49:13.320 --> 49:16.960
During the war,
Florence and I worked
at the clearing stations.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.800
It's where the
wounded are assessed.

49:19.960 --> 49:24.360
Who can wait, who is critical,
who it was pointless to help.

49:25.840 --> 49:27.400
I was good at it.

49:27.760 --> 49:31.240
I never dwelled on the hundreds
of people I sent to die.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.280
Florence wanted
to save everyone.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.640
She was a remarkable
woman, wasn't she?

49:42.360 --> 49:43.400
Mmm.

49:44.040 --> 49:47.240
Towards the end of the war,
a German called Keller

49:47.320 --> 49:49.560
came in with a treatable wound.

49:50.360 --> 49:53.080
I was told he'd
done something awful
and should be left to rot.

49:54.400 --> 49:56.640
When Florence found out,
she threatened to contact

49:56.720 --> 49:59.400
headquarters and then
treated him herself.

50:03.520 --> 50:05.080
She was better than me.

50:10.520 --> 50:12.040
We can't give up.

50:13.440 --> 50:14.680
The police are coming.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.640
They'll see through this
charade in a few hours.

50:16.720 --> 50:18.600
Then we don't have long.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.240
I was wrong about Wade.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.920
That doesn't mean we're
wrong about everything.

50:22.000 --> 50:24.680
I was thinking about my
writing, not the evidence.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.840
[Mabel] Well, what evidence?

50:25.920 --> 50:27.640
We've got to continue
the interviews.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.720
Whilst they still believe
in the inheritance,
we've still got a chance.

50:30.800 --> 50:31.720
How?

50:31.800 --> 50:34.880
I... I think I know
who killed Wade.

50:34.960 --> 50:35.960
Who?

50:36.040 --> 50:37.760
I'm not making the
same mistake twice.

50:37.840 --> 50:39.440
But if I'm right about Wade,

50:39.520 --> 50:41.960
Florence's killer can be
found in the same way.

50:42.400 --> 50:43.840
We can still solve this.

50:44.800 --> 50:46.600
[knocking]

50:49.320 --> 50:50.320
What are you doing?

50:50.400 --> 50:52.440
I had some work
for Miss Rogers.
What are you doing?

50:53.520 --> 50:54.600
The police are here.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.800
So you all received
the same invitation
from Miss Westmacott?

51:01.880 --> 51:03.360
Yes, she's the
one in the glasses.

51:03.440 --> 51:06.440
[DI Dicks] And you all
arrived at the house
at the same time?

51:06.520 --> 51:07.360
Yes.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.680
You certain about that?

51:08.760 --> 51:11.680
Now that you're all here,
I will introduce myself.

51:11.760 --> 51:14.000
My name is Detective
Inspector Dicks.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.040
This is PC Spencer.

51:17.360 --> 51:18.400
I'd rather not shout.

51:25.360 --> 51:28.840
As you may know,
the author Agatha Christie
has gone missing.

51:28.920 --> 51:33.040
There are currently
5,000 police personnel
searching for her,

51:33.120 --> 51:36.720
and as a consequence, my usual
compliment of 13 officers

51:36.800 --> 51:40.720
is running at three, myself
and PC Spencer included.

51:41.720 --> 51:44.080
So because of Mrs. Christie,

51:44.160 --> 51:46.800
I do not have enough officers
to take you to the station,

51:46.880 --> 51:49.000
so I'm forced to
question you here.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.280
We'll start with your
personal details.

51:52.640 --> 51:54.440
These will be
thoroughly checked.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.440
Any false information
will get you arrested,

51:56.520 --> 52:00.120
which, to be honest, will
make my job a little easier.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.640
Accommodating you in the
cells is not a problem.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.640
Although, I would
rather be here

52:05.720 --> 52:08.600
than searching for
authors in bushes,

52:09.000 --> 52:12.400
I do not like working with
one hand tied behind my back.

52:12.480 --> 52:15.280
This process will
take some time,

52:16.480 --> 52:19.320
but please do not keep
asking me how long.

52:19.520 --> 52:22.520
The more annoying you are,
the more of a bastard I'll be.

52:22.680 --> 52:25.360
And please, do not even
think of asking to leave.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.720
Now, Mrs. Westmacott,

52:28.800 --> 52:30.560
I've been told that you
are the person responsible

52:30.640 --> 52:32.960
for bringing everybody here,
so I'll start with you.

52:33.040 --> 52:34.120
Follow me please.

52:35.840 --> 52:37.280
Now, if you don't mind.

52:44.840 --> 52:45.840
Name?

52:45.920 --> 52:47.360
Mary Westmacott.

52:51.280 --> 52:52.480
Date of birth?

52:52.560 --> 52:54.840
September 1st, 1890.

52:56.960 --> 52:58.080
Occupation?

52:58.160 --> 52:59.360
Legal representative.

53:03.160 --> 53:04.520
Employer?

53:05.000 --> 53:07.720
Kant, Hope, Delaney,
26 York Street, W1.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.000
Telephone number?

53:11.080 --> 53:12.560
Mine or theirs?

53:12.640 --> 53:15.160
What would be the point
in having your number?

53:15.440 --> 53:18.800
I'm trying to verify
this ridiculous story
I've just been told.

53:19.080 --> 53:20.320
You always this rude?

53:21.440 --> 53:22.280
Yes.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.600
I'm fully aware of my rights.

53:24.880 --> 53:26.120
Well, that makes one of us.

53:26.400 --> 53:27.880
Are you going to
answer the question?

53:30.880 --> 53:33.000
My office number is London
7-7-3-4.

53:33.080 --> 53:34.400
The secretary's name
is Miss Fisher.

53:34.480 --> 53:35.880
She'll confirm everything.

53:36.600 --> 53:37.720
That'll do?

53:38.440 --> 53:40.200
Am I allowed to
continue my work?

53:40.320 --> 53:42.720
Does your work involve
undermining my investigation?

53:42.800 --> 53:44.520
-Course not.
-Then do what you like.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.120
Thank you, I will.

53:58.600 --> 54:00.480
[Travis sighing]

54:02.400 --> 54:05.160
DI Dicks, what a charmer.

54:06.280 --> 54:08.160
Do hope you're gonna
be a bit more gentle.

54:08.240 --> 54:09.520
Do you have the documents?

54:14.600 --> 54:17.040
Lawyer, goes to the dentist.

54:17.200 --> 54:20.000
When he comes round from
the ether, it's dark.

54:20.800 --> 54:22.720
He asks the nurse,
"What's going on?"

54:23.200 --> 54:26.880
She says, "There's a
fire across the road,
so we drew the blinds.

54:27.920 --> 54:29.920
Didn't want you to wake
up, think you'd died."

54:31.280 --> 54:33.680
[chuckles]

54:34.440 --> 54:35.920
That's very good.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.720
Ah, maybe you're not
such a scratch after all.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.720
You were arrested for
murder in January 1920.

54:41.800 --> 54:43.920
Is that true?

54:48.120 --> 54:50.120
You don't have to
answer my questions,

54:50.200 --> 54:51.560
but it means I can't
do my job,

54:51.640 --> 54:53.480
which means you
won't get your money.

54:55.240 --> 54:56.480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.160
A nurse called Florence.

54:59.040 --> 55:01.800
She was beaten to death.
It was a highly
publicized case.

55:03.040 --> 55:04.080
You've made a mistake.

55:10.960 --> 55:12.480
"No benefit of any kind

55:12.560 --> 55:15.560
can be transferred
to an individual charged
with a capital offense."

55:19.480 --> 55:22.600
Well, in that case,
there's no problem.

55:23.760 --> 55:24.880
I was never charged.

55:24.960 --> 55:26.000
But you were arrested.

55:28.560 --> 55:29.600
Sure.

55:30.560 --> 55:31.720
They tried to pin it on me.

55:31.800 --> 55:33.800
You just said you didn't
know anything about it.

55:34.840 --> 55:35.880
Well, what do you expect?

55:35.960 --> 55:37.760
I expect to be told the truth.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.520
As well as the requirements
to confirm identity,

55:42.600 --> 55:45.000
Mr. Dower gave his executors
a discretionary power

55:45.080 --> 55:48.120
with regards to the moral
suitability of his heirs.

55:50.400 --> 55:52.760
I'm suitable, just careful.

55:52.840 --> 55:54.760
But now I don't know
if you are who you
say you are.

55:54.920 --> 55:55.920
You've got my papers.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.000
Papers can be forged.

55:58.880 --> 56:00.520
Given the sums
of money involved,

56:00.600 --> 56:03.040
I'm sure you can appreciate
the need for thoroughness.

56:05.480 --> 56:06.680
Fair enough.

56:08.040 --> 56:09.960
Does your firm have any
dealings with Scotland Yard?

56:10.760 --> 56:11.720
Of course.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.680
Ask them why they let me off.

56:14.520 --> 56:15.880
For what purpose?

56:15.960 --> 56:18.240
They'll tell you something
they never told the papers.

56:18.840 --> 56:21.160
The killer left a
footprint in the blood.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.000
And?

56:24.080 --> 56:26.840
And there's no way I could
know this if I wasn't arrested.

56:27.920 --> 56:29.480
Took me all of five
seconds to point out

56:29.560 --> 56:31.280
me feet were three
sizes too big.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.960
They even tried to squeeze
me into an old trench boot

56:35.040 --> 56:36.880
like I was fucking Cinderella.

56:36.960 --> 56:38.120
A trench boot?

56:38.200 --> 56:41.360
Yeah, another thing they
never told the public.

56:42.320 --> 56:43.960
Doesn't look good when
our boys come home

56:44.040 --> 56:45.720
and start murdering civilians.

56:50.680 --> 56:51.760
Well...

56:52.280 --> 56:53.600
Guess that means, I've passed.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.680
I'll need to confirm this.

56:56.760 --> 56:58.000
Hmm, confirm away.

56:58.960 --> 57:00.280
The longer we wait,
the more chance

57:00.360 --> 57:02.920
another member of my
family has an accident.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.680
Say what you like
about the Germans,

57:16.760 --> 57:18.280
they know how to make coffee.

57:21.440 --> 57:22.480
Thank you.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.280
That's the first time
I've heard a Frenchman
compliment a German.

57:27.280 --> 57:30.320
After you got over the fact
they were trying to kill you,

57:30.560 --> 57:33.560
most of them are pretty
decent, in my experience.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.680
Your experience
doesn't amount to much.

57:38.640 --> 57:40.000
I lied before.

57:40.240 --> 57:41.360
I'm not really French.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.960
No, you're a bloody traitor.

57:45.160 --> 57:47.960
Come now, dear, we all
have different experiences.

57:48.040 --> 57:49.120
Clearly.

57:51.400 --> 57:53.400
I did not mean to offend.

57:56.280 --> 58:00.000
Mr. Hanachi, could we
speak in private?

58:00.080 --> 58:01.520
[Zaki] I have nothing to hide.

58:01.600 --> 58:04.440
No, but some of the details
of your case are personal.

58:07.520 --> 58:09.960
It does not take
a great detective

58:10.040 --> 58:14.360
to work out my connection
to Mr. Dower is illegitimate.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.800
Unfortunately, my notes
are upstairs.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.000
Okay, I'll come.

58:21.320 --> 58:24.240
But only if Miss Miller
promises to stay here.

58:24.560 --> 58:25.680
I promise.

58:28.680 --> 58:30.400
Don't say another word!

58:32.160 --> 58:34.000
She is a fraud.

58:34.280 --> 58:36.880
Her and that sorry
excuse for a maid.

58:36.960 --> 58:38.080
We've been set up.

58:38.160 --> 58:39.200
What, there's no inheritance?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.920
Ha, that's the least of it.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.040
This whole charade is--

58:43.120 --> 58:44.560
A murder investigation.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.680
Oh, God help me!

58:46.760 --> 58:48.440
-You admit it?
-[Agatha] Of course, I do.

58:48.520 --> 58:51.080
I'm amazed it took you
so long to work it out.

58:51.400 --> 58:53.440
I'm a private detective
hired by Miss Rogers.

58:53.520 --> 58:56.600
You are all suspects
in the murder of
Florence Nightingale Shore.

58:56.680 --> 58:58.640
Florence, but--

58:58.720 --> 59:00.080
How dare you!

59:01.840 --> 59:03.200
My beautiful cousin.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.880
What possible reason
could I have for killing her?

59:08.200 --> 59:09.720
The same reason
that brought you here.

59:10.000 --> 59:11.200
Money.

59:11.600 --> 59:12.920
[Pamela] Well!

59:13.000 --> 59:14.840
I suppose that makes
sense of things.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.120
No, it doesn't.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.240
What has this got
to do with me?

59:18.320 --> 59:20.640
She was killed by someone
wearing service boots.

59:22.880 --> 59:24.120
That's ridiculous.

59:25.080 --> 59:26.840
Florence was the only nurse

59:26.920 --> 59:28.680
who looked after us.
[speaking French]

59:29.440 --> 59:32.360
She didn't care who we
were or what we'd done.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.040
She was perfect.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.640
-I would never--
-You killed her.

59:35.720 --> 59:36.920
Now then.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.960
Now then.

59:39.240 --> 59:43.520
Murderer or not, Mr. Hanachi
is right about one thing.

59:43.600 --> 59:45.360
This is ridiculous.

59:45.760 --> 59:47.880
And a monumental
waste of my time.

59:49.840 --> 59:50.840
Spencer.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.440
I've already got one
murder to deal with.

59:53.520 --> 59:55.880
I couldn't give a rat's
ass about another one.

59:56.200 --> 59:59.040
When this bloody author's
found, I'm taking you all in.

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.920
In the meantime,
you'll stay in your rooms.

1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:05.880
Anyone ignoring this
will be considered
a suspect and arrested.

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:07.600
[Franklin] That is
completely unacceptable.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:10.880
My mother and I have nothing
to do with this absurd game.

1:00:11.240 --> 1:00:13.440
Daphne can attest
to our whereabouts
when Wade was killed

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.560
and we never met
that bloody nurse.

1:00:15.640 --> 1:00:17.160
I insist that we be
allowed to leave.

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:19.920
I'm happy to put you
in handcuffs right now
if that's what you want.

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.320
You've had it from the
inspector's point of view.

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:26.120
This is an
intolerable situation.

1:00:26.360 --> 1:00:29.160
Well, we can agree on that.

1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:35.200
[PC Spencer whispering]

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:43.040
Travis and the fake maid,
Miss Rogers, have gone missing.

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.400
PC Spencer will escort
you to your room

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.920
whilst I will amuse myself
playing hide-and-seek.

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:50.680
I advise you to use
your confinement wisely.

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:52.880
If any of you has
any information

1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:55.440
about the only murder
that I'm interested in,

1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:58.200
do yourself a favor
and come forward.

1:00:58.280 --> 1:01:00.280
Now is a good time to remember

1:01:00.360 --> 1:01:03.920
that there is a difference
between a cell and the gallows.

1:01:08.680 --> 1:01:09.720
All right.

1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:30.280
Are you really trying
to find Florence's killer?

1:01:33.320 --> 1:01:34.920
I'm sorry I got so heated.

1:01:36.080 --> 1:01:37.880
It was a great shock
seeing...

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:40.560
material.

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:44.640
I was never shown
the pictures of

1:01:46.720 --> 1:01:48.280
what was done to her.

1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:49.920
[exhales]

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:53.280
How well do you know Mabel?

1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:00.120
I'll bet she told you
how awful I was.

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:04.560
How the family hated her
relationship with Florence.

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:10.040
Truth is I couldn't care less
that my cousin preferred women.

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:14.920
I just didn't like the fact
that the woman she preferred

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:20.000
was such a controlling,
malign influence.

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:24.440
You have strong feelings
for a woman you never met.

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:27.240
Because Mabel always refused.

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.440
It was easier
to keep her distance

1:02:30.720 --> 1:02:33.040
and pour poison
into my cousin's ear.

1:02:34.520 --> 1:02:38.600
For all her experience,
Florence was very naive.

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:45.000
She had strong convictions,
but was blind to manipulation.

1:02:46.160 --> 1:02:47.560
You didn't know her.

1:02:51.720 --> 1:02:54.920
Mabel hates me because
she was always jealous

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:56.840
of anyone Florence cared for.

1:02:57.760 --> 1:02:58.840
[PC Spencer] Keep up!

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.040
Do you know what always struck
me about Florence's murder?

1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:10.800
The police never questioned

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:12.840
the last person
to see her alive.

1:03:16.080 --> 1:03:17.280
Mabel Rogers.

1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:16.720
PC Spencer?

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:19.520
Mr. Pickford is in the garden
talking to Mr. Todd.

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.720
I can see Mr. Todd,
but not Mr. Pickford.

1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:29.280
It was only a minute ago.

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.480
I'm sure Mr. Todd can
tell you where he's gone.

1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:34.160
Or should we wait
for Inspector Dicks?

1:04:36.760 --> 1:04:38.240
You'd better not be lying.

1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:55.280
Why are you out of your room?

1:04:55.440 --> 1:04:56.720
I could ask you
the same thing.

1:04:56.840 --> 1:04:57.880
What are you doing?

1:04:58.120 --> 1:05:00.240
What does it look like?
I'm crying.

1:05:01.920 --> 1:05:03.800
Is there something
I can do to help?

1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:07.720
Find me somewhere to sleep
where my father wasn't killed.

1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:12.760
You lied about
your job, didn't you?

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:16.800
Leave me alone.

1:05:18.120 --> 1:05:20.000
[Agatha] You almost
killed a young boy,

1:05:20.080 --> 1:05:23.040
then Florence was murdered
and your career was saved.

1:05:23.200 --> 1:05:24.560
What's wrong with you?

1:05:24.920 --> 1:05:26.240
It's a good motive for murder.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:28.080
I couldn't murder
anyone. I'm...

1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:30.400
I'm weak, and I'm stupid.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:32.440
I'm a pathetic little girl.

1:05:33.200 --> 1:05:34.240
Zaki was right,

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:37.720
Florence was better
than all of us.

1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:42.760
That maid is responsible
for all of this.

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:44.760
She deserves
everything she gets,

1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:47.680
and so do you.

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:52.640
[door slams]

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:25.760
I didn't do it!

1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:27.320
What are you doing in there?

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:29.960
-Hiding.
-From whom?

1:06:30.040 --> 1:06:31.000
The police.

1:06:31.360 --> 1:06:32.840
Where did you get that?

1:06:32.920 --> 1:06:34.520
Found it under my pillow.

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:36.040
-[Agatha] Is it loaded?
-Yes.

1:06:36.120 --> 1:06:37.560
Oh, for God's sake, unload it.

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:45.920
Soldiers used to love
showing me their guns.

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.040
[Agatha] Where have you been?

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:49.240
I saw Randolph
with our folder.

1:06:49.320 --> 1:06:52.120
I panicked and hid in here,
then someone came
into the room,

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:54.680
and when they'd gone,
I found this.

1:06:55.840 --> 1:06:57.280
I'm being set up.

1:06:58.000 --> 1:06:59.120
It seems so.

1:06:59.800 --> 1:07:00.840
[Mabel] But by whom?

1:07:01.680 --> 1:07:02.680
Daphne.

1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:06.640
She killed her father.

1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:09.000
Uh, why?

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.560
He beat her. She broke.

1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:15.560
The belt.

1:07:15.800 --> 1:07:17.240
Oh, the make-up.

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:19.720
His work will be under it.

1:07:20.840 --> 1:07:22.440
She was terrified of him.

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:25.640
So, this is Wade's gun.

1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:26.720
Yes.

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:29.120
But why blame me?

1:07:30.480 --> 1:07:33.720
The person who benefits
most from your arrest
is Florence's killer.

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:37.440
But surely Daphne
didn't kill Florence.

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:40.760
It doesn't make sense.

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.400
It does, we're just
missing something.

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:46.560
I need Florence's diaries.
Did Randolph take them?

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:47.760
Uh...

1:07:50.920 --> 1:07:51.960
No.

1:07:58.760 --> 1:08:01.000
I've looked through
them a hundred times.

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:10.280
Keller.

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:12.320
That's it!

1:08:12.760 --> 1:08:14.000
He killed Florence!

1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:15.080
-[door opens]
-Oh!

1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:18.960
This isn't what it looks like!

1:08:19.040 --> 1:08:20.880
Well, that's good
because what it looks like

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.439
is a murder suspect pointing
a gun at two police officers.

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:24.720
It's not loaded.

1:08:26.439 --> 1:08:28.640
Don't worry, you haven't
done anything wrong.

1:08:28.720 --> 1:08:29.880
Everything will be all right.

1:08:29.960 --> 1:08:32.800
Get her to the station
and bring some bloody help.

1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:35.359
You can't make it up.

1:08:35.439 --> 1:08:36.680
[Agatha stutters]
I can explain.

1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:38.640
-No, I mean it.
-So do I.

1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:42.319
No, you couldn't make it up,
could you, Mrs. Christie?

1:08:44.680 --> 1:08:45.760
How did you know?

1:08:47.080 --> 1:08:48.399
I spoke to Miss Fisher.

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:51.720
Oh, she was very convincing,
but the name rang a bell.

1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:53.319
Carlo Fisher,

1:08:53.399 --> 1:08:56.640
interviewed in connection
with the disappearance
of Mrs. Christie.

1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:00.120
And your disguise, I mean,

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:01.880
it's good,
but it's not that good.

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.160
You know they've got
aircraft out looking for you.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:07.960
Parliament practically
demanded it.

1:09:08.240 --> 1:09:09.200
Parliament!

1:09:09.279 --> 1:09:10.680
[DI Dicks]
You've no idea, have you?

1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:12.200
No.

1:09:12.880 --> 1:09:15.279
If it was up to me,
I'd make you pay for it.

1:09:15.800 --> 1:09:18.720
I'd have you writing
till the end of your days
to settle the accounts.

1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:23.760
Policemen don't get
paid much, but 5,000
of us soon adds up.

1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:28.319
I don't even know what
to charge you with.

1:09:28.399 --> 1:09:30.279
I mean, a ten-pound fine
for wasting police time

1:09:30.359 --> 1:09:31.640
hardly seems to cover it.

1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:35.279
Daphne killed her father.

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:37.319
I'll give you that.

1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:38.680
You knew?

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:41.200
Of course, she was
the only one in the room
when he got shot.

1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:44.680
Doesn't take Sherlock
Holmes to work out
she was the most likely.

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.080
Speaking of which,
there's another person you
need to make reparations to.

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:52.800
Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle
held a seance to try

1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:55.680
and track you down, used one
of your gloves apparently.

1:09:58.120 --> 1:10:00.560
Was the cut to her
hand from the recoil?

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:01.760
Probably.

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:04.120
Gun this size shouldn't
be shot from the hip.

1:10:04.200 --> 1:10:06.560
She killed him because
of what he did to her.

1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:08.520
That's a defense.

1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:10.640
The jury will understand
if she'll talk,

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.320
but I doubt she will.

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:16.920
If I was right about Daphne,
don't you think I might be
right about the other murder?

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:19.480
No.

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.360
No more playing detectives.

1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.440
[Agatha] Don't you want
to know what's going on?

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.480
[DI Dicks]
That's why I arrested
Miss Rogers.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.520
Have you ever been obsessed
with something, Inspector?

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:36.720
Just the law, Mrs. Christie.

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:41.240
A while ago, I realized
that's what I write
about, obsession.

1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:44.200
The inability to clear
something from one's mind.

1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:46.480
I'm not in the mood
for philosophizing.

1:10:46.560 --> 1:10:48.080
There's no philosophy
in obsession,

1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:50.000
just feeling, usually pain.

1:10:50.440 --> 1:10:51.600
I mean it, let's go.

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:54.280
Mabel is obsessed
with finding the killer
of the person she loved.

1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:58.000
I dare say she's been
obsessed with Florence
since the day they met.

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.080
That's what it's like
in my experience.
[chuckles softly]

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:03.920
My husband is leaving me.

1:11:06.320 --> 1:11:08.680
He's been having an
affair with a 24-year-old.

1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:13.280
They consummated their
relationship on a golf course.

1:11:17.920 --> 1:11:19.760
But I didn't come
here to escape him.

1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:25.240
If I could, I'd spend
every minute by his side.

1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:32.080
I recognized that
obsession in Mabel.

1:11:34.360 --> 1:11:36.080
I came here to help
the both of us.

1:11:51.960 --> 1:11:53.760
When I came back
from the war,

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:57.200
my wife gave me the clap.

1:12:04.280 --> 1:12:06.080
In my experience,

1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:09.600
obsession's like getting
caught in no-man's land.

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.880
You'd get out if you could,
but you don't know where

1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:15.200
the bullets are
coming from,

1:12:16.720 --> 1:12:21.080
so you're better off
sitting in the shell hole
and covering your ears.

1:12:23.720 --> 1:12:25.800
You never know,
you might get lucky.

1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:35.320
Do you really know
who killed Florence?

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.640
I have a plan,
but I need your help.

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:50.080
[Travis] Well,

1:12:50.760 --> 1:12:52.920
it's the first time
I've eaten with a pig.

1:12:53.280 --> 1:12:54.440
No offense.

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:55.960
[DI Dicks] This is a first
time I've eaten

1:12:56.040 --> 1:12:57.680
with a group of
people gotten together

1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:00.240
under false pretenses
with the promise
of an inheritance.

1:13:00.920 --> 1:13:02.760
-[Travis chuckles]
-When can we leave?

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:04.200
When PC Spencer gets back,

1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:06.280
he'll start ferrying
you to the station.

1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:09.040
Short statement, then
you're none of my concern.

1:13:09.880 --> 1:13:11.560
Unless, of course,
your impatience

1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:13.360
is the sign
of a guilty conscience.

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.440
Don't worry, I have my killer.

1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:23.040
I still do not understand
why Miss Rogers
tried to murder Daphne.

1:13:24.560 --> 1:13:27.880
I wouldn't normally
discuss a case,
but under the circumstances,

1:13:28.560 --> 1:13:30.880
Miss Rogers thought
that Miss Miller

1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:33.120
had killed her friend Florence.

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:36.360
This whole debacle was
an elaborate act of revenge.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.040
Unbelievable!

1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:42.600
What is it they
say about revenge?

1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:44.720
Dig two graves.

1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:45.960
She'll hang for sure.

1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.640
I want to apologize,

1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:54.200
when I take jobs,
I tend not to think
about the consequences.

1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:57.560
In my experience,
the greatest harm
is done by people

1:13:57.640 --> 1:13:59.360
who pursue a course of action,

1:13:59.440 --> 1:14:01.560
despite being told of
the damage it will do.

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:04.360
When I was in Verdun--

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:07.120
Oh, not the bloody war again.

1:14:08.080 --> 1:14:09.360
[Pamela clears throat]

1:14:11.040 --> 1:14:13.600
Here's to the
family that never was.

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:15.360
[scattered chuckling]

1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:19.960
Where's Daphne?

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:21.240
She's not feeling very well,

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:22.960
said she was going
to stay in her room.

1:14:23.040 --> 1:14:24.280
I'll check on her,

1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:26.560
given what I've put
that poor girl through.

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:28.720
[Randolph] For the record...

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:33.120
I think you should look again
at the murder of my cousin.

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:35.800
It's quite possible
this Rogers woman

1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:38.960
is some sort of
homicidal maniac.

1:14:40.040 --> 1:14:41.400
Yes, it's true.

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:43.680
Some people do get
a taste for murder.

1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.440
[door opens]

1:14:55.160 --> 1:14:58.040
Inspector Dicks said
you'd be coming to see me.

1:14:59.080 --> 1:15:00.280
What's going on?

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.840
Pamela said Miss Rogers
has been arrested.

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:06.000
Yes.

1:15:06.840 --> 1:15:09.520
She was found with the gun
you used to kill your father.

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.760
[sobbing]

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.400
I can't imagine what
you've been through.

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:21.360
I should have used
that gun on myself.

1:15:22.920 --> 1:15:24.720
All that matters now is
that we find the people

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:26.800
who blackmailed
you to frame Mabel.

1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:28.240
None of this is your fault.

1:15:32.560 --> 1:15:35.120
Did your father leave England
to escape conscription?

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:42.760
He beat my mother
and I our whole life,

1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:44.600
and then he ran
away from the fight.

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:48.760
If you tell the truth,
they'll understand.

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:50.960
The truth is,

1:15:52.200 --> 1:15:54.920
I wish I'd shot
that bastard years ago.

1:15:56.360 --> 1:15:58.040
I killed him.

1:15:58.120 --> 1:15:59.280
[Agatha] I know.

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:02.080
But you didn't plan it.

1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:03.640
You're not a murderer.

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:06.080
We'll help you.

1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:17.520
Someone else knew it was me.

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:20.400
[Agatha] Yes.

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:25.840
Why did you say "people"?

1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:38.120
How is Daphne?

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:39.960
[Agatha] As good
as can be expected.

1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:42.960
Perhaps you might take
her something to eat.

1:16:47.880 --> 1:16:49.320
Not very subtle, is he?

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:50.400
[chuckles]

1:16:50.920 --> 1:16:53.920
I still have some of
Miss Rogers' material.

1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:55.760
Given that most of it
relates to your cousin

1:16:55.840 --> 1:16:57.760
perhaps you would
like to take it,

1:16:58.040 --> 1:16:59.760
assuming the inspector
doesn't mind.

1:17:01.000 --> 1:17:02.080
That would be kind.

1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:06.640
That awful women kept
so much that was personal
to the family.

1:17:06.720 --> 1:17:09.280
It would be very
gratifying to get it back.

1:17:13.720 --> 1:17:16.560
Oh, I wouldn't worry
about the inspector.

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:18.320
He has other things
on his mind.

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:20.360
He's with Travis

1:17:20.440 --> 1:17:23.320
who seems to have
forgotten his cousin's
golden rule.

1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:29.040
Daphne asked if you would
check in on her after dinner.

1:17:40.480 --> 1:17:42.320
[knocking on door]

1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.760
Where's Daphne?
We're starting to worry.

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:18.200
When you beat Florence
to death, what did you
think about?

1:18:21.520 --> 1:18:22.800
I've always wondered.

1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:26.400
During the act of murder,
is there anything
but the act itself?

1:18:27.840 --> 1:18:30.320
Does the brain reject
what the body is doing,

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:32.000
or is there gratification?

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:34.840
Did you enjoy it?

1:18:36.800 --> 1:18:38.960
Did Florence even understand
why you were doing it?

1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:41.240
That she was being killed
for saving a man's life.

1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:42.560
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.960
Your son James would be
alive were it not for Florence.

1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:47.920
She saved the man
who murdered him,
Captain Dieter Keller.

1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:51.800
A man everyone told her should
be left to die, a monster.

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:56.120
But, as Mr. Hanachi said,
Florence helped everyone

1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.440
regardless of who they
were or what they'd done.

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:01.240
-We're leaving.
-Was it you in the
compartment next to Florence

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:03.200
making sure she was
alone with your son?

1:19:05.360 --> 1:19:07.800
This is as insulting
as it is stupid.

1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:10.760
Not as stupid as
leaving a bloody footprint
at the scene of the crime.

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:12.360
If you'd had the stomach
to kill her yourself,

1:19:12.440 --> 1:19:14.640
I doubt such a mistake
would have been made.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:17.120
You planned everything
so carefully.

1:19:17.200 --> 1:19:19.080
Florence told you which
train she was traveling on,

1:19:19.160 --> 1:19:20.440
which carriage she'd be in.

1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:22.680
You hid a coat and cap
underneath the bench seat

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:24.480
for Franklin to wear
when he escaped.

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:25.920
If I were you, I'd stop.

1:19:27.280 --> 1:19:29.120
You left evidence
in the compartment.

1:19:29.200 --> 1:19:30.960
Evidence the police still have.

1:19:31.040 --> 1:19:34.120
Evidence that will send you
and your mother to the gallows.

1:19:34.200 --> 1:19:35.360
The footprint?

1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:37.720
There's a million servicemen
it could have come from.

1:19:37.800 --> 1:19:39.920
And a million crimes
left unpunished.

1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:44.360
How did you feel
when you found out
that Florence wasn't dead?

1:19:44.760 --> 1:19:47.760
That despite all your
mother's plans, you'd failed.

1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.400
[sighing]

1:19:57.760 --> 1:19:59.200
I didn't want to kill her.

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:00.280
Franklin!

1:20:04.040 --> 1:20:06.960
I bashed her skull just
enough to get her attention.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:12.640
I wanted her to understand
why it was happening.

1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:19.200
I explained that her
death was the result
of her sanctimonious morality.

1:20:22.400 --> 1:20:24.840
And I bashed her
skull a bit more.

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:30.360
As an ex-priest,
I'm compelled
to offer confession

1:20:30.440 --> 1:20:32.480
and absolution to someone
approaching death.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:39.120
But as I told Florence before
I beat her into a coma...

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.680
not everyone can be saved.

1:20:47.120 --> 1:20:49.000
[grunting]

1:20:49.080 --> 1:20:50.520
[DI Dicks yelling]

1:20:50.800 --> 1:20:51.920
[gasping]

1:21:02.040 --> 1:21:02.920
[gasping]

1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:06.080
Something else I didn't
learn in the army.

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:09.200
We were in the next room.
We heard every word.

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:13.800
Who'd have thought that
the walls in this place
would be so thin?

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:16.600
But you knew that,
didn't ya?

1:21:16.720 --> 1:21:18.480
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:21:19.480 --> 1:21:22.400
You and your son listened to
what happened to Mr. Miller.

1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:26.000
And then you blackmailed Daphne
into framing Miss Rogers.

1:21:26.360 --> 1:21:27.720
-Really?
-[DI Dicks] Yes!

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:31.240
And you've implicated yourself
in a premeditated murder.

1:21:31.720 --> 1:21:35.040
The only thing that's
happened here is a vicious
assault on my son.

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.040
Whatever you
think you've heard,

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.280
I'd like to know what
evidence you have

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:42.480
to back up these
scandalous accusations.

1:21:42.880 --> 1:21:44.720
A murder weapon perhaps?

1:21:44.840 --> 1:21:46.200
Maybe an item of clothing?

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:50.080
I heard something about
a pair of bloody boots.

1:21:50.240 --> 1:21:51.560
That sounds incriminating.

1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:54.320
You have them, I assume.

1:21:58.600 --> 1:21:59.760
I didn't think so.

1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:03.520
Nothing that was said
here can be used in court.

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:07.440
This pathetic attempt
at entrapment is over.

1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:08.560
You failed.

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:15.400
Pamela Rose,
you are under arrest

1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:17.440
for the murder of Wade Miller.

1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:20.320
You do not have
to say anything,
but if you do say anything,

1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:22.800
it will be taken down and
may be used in evidence.

1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:26.080
You wouldn't?

1:22:32.600 --> 1:22:33.760
Zaki?

1:22:38.560 --> 1:22:41.400
I saw Mrs. Rose take the
gun from Wade's luggage.

1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:44.160
That's a lie.

1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:50.000
It was Mabel, she deserves it.

1:22:50.080 --> 1:22:51.280
You know that.

1:22:55.200 --> 1:22:58.720
Mrs. Rose left this note
in Daphne's room.

1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:07.760
There's been a horrible
misunderstanding.

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:11.120
Whatever they've told you,
it isn't true.

1:23:14.400 --> 1:23:17.320
I caught a glimpse
of the killer
through the door.

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:18.400
It was him.

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:24.520
You can't do this.

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:28.240
Let me know if his
balls don't recover.

1:23:28.320 --> 1:23:31.160
I'll say a prayer, or two.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:34.960
No.

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:37.520
No!

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:55.720
All right?

1:24:05.360 --> 1:24:06.920
Will you be all right?

1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:09.240
I hope so.

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:15.960
I'm sorry.

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:18.440
About Mabel?

1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:21.720
I was wrong about her.

1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:24.320
She surprised you.

1:24:25.280 --> 1:24:26.560
Yes.

1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.360
People don't often
surprise in a good way.

1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:33.120
No, no, I suppose not.

1:24:51.840 --> 1:24:53.640
Would you do me a favor?

1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:58.200
I'd like to ask Mabel to tea.

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:00.560
Tea?

1:25:00.920 --> 1:25:02.040
That's what he said.

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:06.600
Her family have spent
20 years pretending
I didn't exist.

1:25:14.840 --> 1:25:16.520
Inspector Dicks says
if I'm not found

1:25:16.600 --> 1:25:18.840
in the next 24 hours,
they'll call out the army.

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:21.040
Will you go home?

1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:22.760
What will you say?

1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:24.920
Can't remember.

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:29.200
One minute I was driving
my car, the next...

1:25:29.560 --> 1:25:30.720
Amnesia!

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:31.800
Really!

1:25:32.920 --> 1:25:34.760
It's like something
from a bad novel.

1:25:35.680 --> 1:25:37.880
Dicks told me
to keep it simple.

1:25:38.080 --> 1:25:39.040
He's going to help.

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.200
What will you do?

1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:47.560
Finding Florence's killer
is all I've thought
about for six years.

1:25:48.920 --> 1:25:50.240
How do I stop?

1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:54.760
I have no idea.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:25:59.640
[bell dinging]

1:26:09.160 --> 1:26:10.560
You have your family.

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:14.160
The police questioned
Archie about my disappearance.

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:17.640
They probably think
he knocked me off
in order to marry Nancy.

1:26:18.560 --> 1:26:20.720
And get an inheritance.

1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:22.520
-I better change my will.
-[Mabel chuckles]

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:31.720
I'll agree to a divorce.

1:26:34.600 --> 1:26:37.840
And I'll stop living my
life through Florence's death.

1:26:40.760 --> 1:26:42.200
I don't want to.

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:45.160
Me neither.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.120
Now then.

1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:53.400
Bloody hell, should I put
you two on suicide watch?

1:26:54.600 --> 1:26:56.120
We're discussing the future.

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:57.560
Bad, is it?

1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.280
Worse than being hung for
a crime you didn't commit?

1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:03.560
Or being caught up in
a scandal so spectacular,

1:27:03.880 --> 1:27:06.120
you'd want to settle down
with a nice big nightcap?

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:08.560
Knowing that
things could be worse

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:11.280
is not much comfort,
in my experience.

1:27:13.680 --> 1:27:15.160
Well, that's true.

1:27:19.040 --> 1:27:22.320
Still, be good
for your writing.

1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:25.320
The novel I'm working on
is terrible.
It won't help that.

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:28.240
With the sensation you've
caused, you could publish

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:31.600
a book on concrete ratios
and it'd still be
a bestseller.

1:27:31.840 --> 1:27:33.480
Just have to have
the right title.

1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:35.720
Make it simple.

1:27:37.040 --> 1:27:38.680
Murder on the Building Site.

1:27:40.040 --> 1:27:42.320
I don't think my
publishers would agree.

1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:45.960
Well, as we sat here talking,
they're busy getting
everything together they've got

1:27:46.040 --> 1:27:47.480
just in case you turn up dead.

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:49.880
Oh, thanks, I feel much better.

1:27:55.880 --> 1:27:57.680
Did we do the right thing?

1:27:59.800 --> 1:28:01.840
Well, I am glad
I'll join this conversation.

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.520
They'll hang.

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:07.200
They murdered
in cold blood,
that's what it's for.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:13.800
Does it feel like justice?

1:28:16.120 --> 1:28:17.240
Yes, but...

1:28:18.440 --> 1:28:20.800
[exhales] It's a funny
kind of justice

1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:23.240
that's carried out by
a group of strangers.

1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:28.120
If she were alive, Florence
would be helping strangers.

1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:38.640
You never told me
why you suspected

1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:40.640
Franklin and Pamela
in the first place.

1:28:40.720 --> 1:28:42.440
Apart from you,
they were the only people

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.920
who knew which train and
carriage Florence was in.

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.840
Once I stopped
indulging fantasies,

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:48.640
they were the most
likely suspects.

1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:51.240
Hmm.

1:28:51.840 --> 1:28:53.320
It's a shame
the truth of murder

1:28:53.400 --> 1:28:55.480
doesn't lend itself
to detective stories.

1:28:56.280 --> 1:28:58.440
Well, it won't be much good
if the person most likely

1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:00.280
to have done it,
actually did it.

1:29:01.200 --> 1:29:02.280
No,

1:29:03.440 --> 1:29:04.840
that would never work.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:06.800
Time to go.

1:29:06.880 --> 1:29:08.400
I just got comfy.
Was it something I said?

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:09.800
No, Inspector.

1:29:11.160 --> 1:29:12.960
Something I thought.
