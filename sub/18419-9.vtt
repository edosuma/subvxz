WEBVTT

02:08.229 --> 02:09.497
Shit.

02:17.738 --> 02:18.672
Are you all right?

02:18.739 --> 02:21.675
I'm sorry.
I had a moment.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.713
I can't get it
out of my head.

02:27.047 --> 02:29.217
The gun in my face
in that club.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.853
Ed just said Taishi's dead.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.956
I don't remember anyone
mentioning a gun in your face.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.359
I thought the kempeitai
was going to kill us.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.796
What happened exactly?

02:53.140 --> 02:54.642
You didn't tell me.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.447
Tell you about what?

03:02.883 --> 03:05.253
The club, the Yakuza,

03:05.253 --> 03:08.456
and the Pon
who pointed the gun
but didn't shoot you.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.262
Was that Kido
or Yoshida?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.814
Where did you get this?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.782
A journalist friend.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.218
Says it's a thousand
times more powerful

04:11.319 --> 04:13.354
than the bomb we
dropped on Hiroshima.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.823
The U.S. tested it
out in the open

04:15.889 --> 04:19.627
so they could taunt--
spook the Russians.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.343
Desperate times, Bill.

04:35.343 --> 04:37.578
What's Berlin saying?

04:37.645 --> 04:39.613
What you'd imagine.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.615
What do you think's
going to happen?

04:41.682 --> 04:44.184
Here you go, sir.
Dry martini.

04:44.251 --> 04:45.853
I think we're going
to drink some more,

04:45.919 --> 04:46.954
head back to the office,

04:47.020 --> 04:48.956
and hope someone
more important than us

04:49.022 --> 04:50.958
- has a plan.
- I'll drink to that.

04:53.961 --> 04:58.265
Mm. Pour us another.
I got to use the men's room.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.900
I'll get you
two more, sir.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.236
Henry.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.406
Julia.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.140
Is everything okay?

05:07.207 --> 05:08.976
Uh, it's Lucy.
We were having lunch,

05:09.042 --> 05:10.143
and she said
she felt faint.

05:10.210 --> 05:11.645
She said your office
was close by.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.382
- Is she all right?
- She collapsed in the lobby.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.716
They said you were here.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.651
She's just, um,
resting upstairs.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.388
Told her to go
to the doctor's,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.590
but she's stubborn
about it.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.958
I'm glad you were
with her, Julia.

05:25.025 --> 05:25.893
Thank you.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.462
Of course. Anyone
would do the same.

05:29.397 --> 05:30.598
Lucy?

05:30.664 --> 05:31.632
Lucy.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.636
Sit down.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.637
Julia.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.413
Who are you?

05:48.416 --> 05:50.283
We've got your wife.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.019
And if you don't want us

05:52.085 --> 05:54.522
to put a bullet
in her pretty little head,

05:54.588 --> 05:56.256
you'll do exactly
what I say.

05:56.323 --> 05:59.793
Now please sit down.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.632
I'll have you killed
for this.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.768
Please
just do what he says.

06:14.908 --> 06:15.709
I love my wife,

06:15.776 --> 06:18.879
but if you think
that Lucy or I

06:18.946 --> 06:20.648
would betray everything
that we ever believed in--

06:20.714 --> 06:23.183
Don't do it for her
or yourself.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.485
Do it for your kid.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.991
Oh. You don't know
that she's pregnant?

06:35.463 --> 06:36.897
You're lying.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.134
She, uh...

06:43.103 --> 06:45.138
didn't want to tell you

06:45.205 --> 06:47.340
until she was sure.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.943
She said you've been
trying for a while.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.926
What do you want?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.681
"American Reich."

07:27.748 --> 07:30.217
Two cops, one big city.

07:39.993 --> 07:41.829
He's one of
the only men in New York

07:41.895 --> 07:44.031
who can walk us
into a TV station.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.667
There's got to be
another way

07:46.734 --> 07:48.368
to get the message
out there.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.070
You, of all people,

07:50.137 --> 07:52.873
shouldn't doubt
the power of pictures.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.241
People believe
what they see,

07:54.307 --> 07:56.677
particularly when it comes
from the authorities.

07:56.744 --> 07:59.012
This is our best chance.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.549
If I do this, they're going
to know I'm working with you,

08:01.549 --> 08:03.083
and I can't go home.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.654
If I stay here,
I'm as good as dead.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.656
After you do this,

08:08.722 --> 08:11.091
our people will smuggle
you to the Neutral Zone.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.262
What about
what I did for Joe?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.866
All will be forgiven?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.568
Not forgiven.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.073
We'll call it even.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.609
What'll happen to Lucy?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.911
If he plays his part,
we'll let her go.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.445
What about him?

08:32.580 --> 08:33.914
Nothing good.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.650
The last time you tried
to protect a Nazi,

08:36.717 --> 08:38.819
you basically became one.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.899
My name is Henry Collins.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.602
I'm Deputy Minister
of Information

08:54.635 --> 08:56.136
for the Greater Nazi Reich.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.274
You've all been
the victims of a lie.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.276
For the past few days,
you've been told

09:03.343 --> 09:05.078
that the Führer
is alive and well,

09:05.145 --> 09:08.616
on vacation at his
retreat in Austria.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.854
But the truth...

09:13.921 --> 09:16.156
is that Adolf Hitler
died last night in Berlin.

09:17.357 --> 09:18.692
The forces of the Reich

09:18.759 --> 09:20.628
did not wish you
to know this truth--

09:36.176 --> 09:38.245
Henry Collins
was a personal friend.

09:38.311 --> 09:39.880
We believe
he was coerced.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.649
His colleagues
report he was
approached by a woman

09:41.682 --> 09:43.016
shortly before
he rushed off.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.952
- What about Lucy, his wife?
- Missing, sir,

09:45.018 --> 09:46.820
and there were
signs of a struggle at her home.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.657
Well, the Resistance
certainly timed this well.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.425
There were millions
of people watching
that broadcast.

09:52.492 --> 09:54.561
The news service is calling
it terrorist propaganda

09:54.628 --> 09:57.364
and reassuring the public
the Führer is alive and well.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.232
A bit late for that.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.169
Put all the S.S.
divisions on alert.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.039
Yes?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.209
Please hold for
the acting Chancellor.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.184
Chancellor Heusmann?

10:17.250 --> 10:18.952
It was my understanding

10:19.019 --> 10:21.354
that the Resistance there
were ineffectual,

10:21.421 --> 10:22.790
and yet they managed

10:22.856 --> 10:25.058
to make the tragic news
of the Führer public

10:25.125 --> 10:27.460
long before we were
prepared to do so.

10:27.527 --> 10:31.131
We will apprehend
the perpetrators,

10:31.198 --> 10:32.332
I assure you.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.667
I understand

10:33.734 --> 10:36.036
these are extraordinary
times, but

10:36.103 --> 10:39.372
I have to know that I can
rely on my senior officers.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.174
You can, sir.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.744
You have been very
effective until now.

10:43.811 --> 10:46.914
And I will never forget
what you've done for my son.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.883
But this does not
inspire confidence.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.786
I will restore order, sir,

10:52.853 --> 10:54.988
I assure you.

10:55.055 --> 10:57.024
See to it that you do.

10:57.090 --> 11:00.160
And remain at your post
until the upheaval is over.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.729
Yes, Chancellor.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.297
Heil Hitler.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.444
The monumental,
fast-moving events

11:17.510 --> 11:19.146
of the past 13 days

11:19.212 --> 11:21.348
apparently reached a peaceful
conclusion today...

11:22.649 --> 11:23.984
following Khrushchev's orders

11:24.051 --> 11:26.153
to withdraw all missiles
from Cuba.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.555
President Kennedy
spoke of the need

11:28.621 --> 11:30.023
for measures to ensure

11:30.090 --> 11:31.859
that the near-catastrophic
turn of events

11:31.925 --> 11:33.393
are never repeated.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.098
In order to assure
cooperation,

11:38.165 --> 11:41.001
the United Nations will
oversee the resolution.

11:41.068 --> 11:44.271
As we move toward the
conclusion of this crisis,

11:44.337 --> 11:46.273
the President
reminded Khrushchev

11:46.339 --> 11:48.541
there is still a grand
endeavor to undertake

11:48.608 --> 11:50.010
to soothe the fears of war

11:50.077 --> 11:52.245
between Russia
and the United States.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.647
Until wider measures
of disarmament

11:54.782 --> 11:55.983
can be agreed upon,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.284
the threat
of nuclear conflict

11:57.350 --> 11:58.351
continues to live.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.164
Happy days
are here again.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.800
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

12:20.107 --> 12:21.274
Okay.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.911
The parking garage
for the kempeitai building.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.448
I'd park the bomb right here.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.817
Number 5.

12:29.850 --> 12:32.252
In the middle of this building

12:32.319 --> 12:33.686
is their war room
where the kempeitai

12:33.821 --> 12:35.222
and their military
intelligence

12:35.288 --> 12:37.124
coordinate all their efforts
against the Resistance.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.826
Directly above the garage.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.861
So I go in, and I park.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.930
I set that timer.
I get out.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.865
I start walking up the stairs
through the lobby.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.033
I keep walking

12:46.099 --> 12:47.968
out the door,
nice and calm.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.638
Tick, tick, tick, boom.
Fuck you.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.342
How's that for bringing
your plague to the Pharaohs?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.644
Okay,
but they're on alert,

12:57.710 --> 12:59.546
so how do we get it
inside?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.214
You didn't tell me.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.120
Tell you about what?

13:10.423 --> 13:12.725
The club, the Yakuza,

13:12.860 --> 13:16.096
and the Pon
who pointed the gun
but didn't shoot you.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.869
Was that Kido
or Yoshida?

13:22.702 --> 13:23.904
I don't--

13:25.472 --> 13:27.440
I'm-- I'm not sure
what you're getting at.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.277
I'm getting
at the kempeitai
sparing your life

13:30.343 --> 13:32.245
instead of
shooting you dead.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.549
Childan told you
about that.

13:36.616 --> 13:37.985
Yeah.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.453
He doesn't know anything
about it, Frank.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.723
Neither do I.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.592
So start
explaining it to me.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.231
It's when I met Mr. Kido.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.666
He beat me,
and he starved me,

13:53.733 --> 13:56.303
and he told me he'd kill us
and everybody in the factory

13:56.369 --> 13:57.570
if I didn't agree.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.406
Agree to what?

13:59.472 --> 14:00.908
I told him things.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.375
You told him things.

14:02.442 --> 14:03.944
I-- I did, but listen.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.913
It was only
about the Yakuza

14:05.913 --> 14:07.047
and the counterfeiting.

14:07.114 --> 14:08.348
Most of the stuff
he already knew.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.983
What did you tell him
about the bomb?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.919
No, I didn't. I promise.
Nothing about the bomb

14:11.919 --> 14:13.921
or Gary or Sara
or any of that.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.389
Listen,

14:16.456 --> 14:18.926
I did it because
you're my best friend,

14:18.959 --> 14:20.928
and I did what I did
to keep you alive.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.029
- No.
- Yes, I did.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.596
- Piece of shit.
- No!

14:28.301 --> 14:29.836
All right,
so we have to find a way

14:29.937 --> 14:31.371
that they just
wave us through.

14:31.438 --> 14:33.006
- I do have an idea.
- I need to do this.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.711
You said we're taking out
the Chief Inspector?

14:38.778 --> 14:39.947
Yeah.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.414
Well, he's the Pon

14:41.481 --> 14:43.150
who gassed my sister
and her kids.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.317
They were innocent,
defenseless,

14:44.384 --> 14:45.852
and Kido gassed them
for no reason

14:45.953 --> 14:47.220
except that he could.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.824
I'm not afraid.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.726
I've seen myself die.
You know that.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.995
I've replayed the moment
in my head

14:55.062 --> 14:56.463
a dozen times at 2 a.m.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.965
I've reached back

14:57.965 --> 15:00.667
and felt the bullet hole
in my skull.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.238
I'm the one
who's meant to do this.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.979
I'm your driver.
I'm your bomber.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.383
I'm your man.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.594
Oh, good.
You found the place.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.030
Don't make me laugh,
Joe.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.598
Not here.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.671
I'll get it.

15:42.242 --> 15:45.012
I never imagined I would
set foot in here

15:45.045 --> 15:47.214
or expect
to see you here.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.017
You've never been
to your father's office?

15:50.050 --> 15:52.219
My father
isn't the Führer.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.721
Neither is mine.
he's acting Chancellor.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.191
Imagine the meetings
that have taken place here,

15:58.258 --> 16:01.194
the arguments,
the secret conversations.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.063
The decisions
made in this room

16:03.130 --> 16:04.697
have shaped the world.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.133
It's just an office.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.701
You don't believe that you
can work in this office

16:08.768 --> 16:10.170
and not be political.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.938
Here you are in the office

16:12.039 --> 16:14.041
of the most powerful
man on Earth,

16:14.041 --> 16:17.644
yet I'm not sure
you even believe in what
the Reich stands for.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.556
You know, when I was a kid...

16:30.457 --> 16:33.860
all I wanted was a father.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.129
That is the only
ambition I had.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.065
You know,
I used to imagine

16:38.098 --> 16:41.201
that he was this great man

16:41.268 --> 16:43.536
doing such important
things in the world

16:43.603 --> 16:45.638
that of course
he didn't have time

16:45.705 --> 16:48.075
to come to Brooklyn.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.911
After all these years,
I've...

16:51.978 --> 16:53.546
now found out the truth.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.184
Turns our he is
that man after all.

17:01.921 --> 17:05.525
I understand loyalty
to a person...

17:06.893 --> 17:08.361
not a cause.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.199
People of the Reich

17:12.265 --> 17:13.600
and its territories,

17:13.666 --> 17:17.104
as acting Chancellor
Martin Heusmann,

17:17.170 --> 17:21.274
I'm here to inform you
of a great tragedy.

17:21.341 --> 17:26.813
Our glorious Führer
Adolf Hitler...

17:26.879 --> 17:28.115
ist...

17:28.115 --> 17:30.350
has passed away.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.452
The period of mourning

17:32.519 --> 17:34.121
that will follow
the celebration

17:34.121 --> 17:35.455
of the Führer's life,

17:35.522 --> 17:37.390
will happen in a few days.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.360
It was believed that
the death of the Führer

17:40.427 --> 17:42.662
was due to natural causes.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.234
But, after a serious
investigation

17:47.300 --> 17:49.936
by the most renowned
doctors of the Reich,

17:50.002 --> 17:52.705
we have found out that
the blood of the Führer

17:52.772 --> 17:55.608
was tainted
with a rare poison.

17:57.744 --> 17:58.778
People of the Reich,

17:58.845 --> 18:01.013
it is our understanding,

18:01.148 --> 18:02.282
after the investigation,

18:02.349 --> 18:05.285
that our glorious Führer
Adolf Hitler

18:05.352 --> 18:06.619
was assassinated.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.323
Following our investigation,

18:10.390 --> 18:14.694
it has been found out
that our closest allies

18:14.761 --> 18:18.831
were the ones responsible
for the assassination.

18:21.301 --> 18:22.569
Be assured

18:22.635 --> 18:25.605
that our vengeance
will be swift

18:25.672 --> 18:27.574
and crushing.

18:27.640 --> 18:34.881
This crime is nothing else
but an act of war.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.896
Thomas. Hi.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.564
Y-You okay?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.932
May I come in?

18:52.999 --> 18:54.467
Sure.

18:58.405 --> 19:01.040
D-Do your parents
know you're here?

19:01.107 --> 19:02.375
Yeah.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.812
What, uh...

19:07.013 --> 19:08.415
What happened to me

19:08.481 --> 19:09.982
at the--

19:10.049 --> 19:12.285
at the funeral...

19:14.521 --> 19:17.290
Y-Y-You felt--
You felt faint.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.491
You were upset.

19:18.558 --> 19:20.427
No, I--
I know that's a lie.

19:22.229 --> 19:23.596
Please.

19:25.097 --> 19:27.834
Please, Julia, just...

19:27.900 --> 19:29.236
tell me.

19:33.706 --> 19:34.707
Please.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.648
I-- Thomas.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.087
Thomas.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.257
Thomas.

19:52.091 --> 19:55.295
Listen, I am so touched
that you came to me,

19:55.362 --> 19:56.663
but you have got to go home

19:56.729 --> 19:58.265
and talk to your parents
about this.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.932
They're not
telling me the truth

19:59.999 --> 20:01.268
about what's wrong
with me.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.503
I had looked my symptoms
up in the library.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.472
All the books
say that the symptoms

20:05.538 --> 20:07.807
point to signs
of a serious defect.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.942
Thomas, I don't know
any more than you do.

20:10.009 --> 20:13.212
Okay? But what I do know
is that we all have flaws--

20:13.280 --> 20:15.081
all of us,
every single one of us.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.616
It makes us who we are.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.886
What if my flaws
are the kind

20:19.952 --> 20:23.290
to be eradicated for--
for the good of everyone?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.157
Do not think that way,
okay?

20:25.224 --> 20:26.359
You cannot think that way.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.760
Then why does everybody
think that way?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.161
- I don't know.
- Why is it the law?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.464
I don't know.
But I know

20:31.531 --> 20:34.667
that your family loves
you so much, okay?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.237
And that is all
that matters.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.975
Now you go home
and talk to your mom.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.846
- Promise?
- Okay.

20:49.549 --> 20:50.550
Go on.

21:16.343 --> 21:20.447
Your efforts
to avoid this outcome
are an inspiration, sir.

21:21.881 --> 21:25.251
My efforts failed.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.354
But they're honorable.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.557
And I'm grateful

21:30.623 --> 21:32.425
that you allowed me
to take part.

21:44.937 --> 21:47.707
It is I who am grateful,
Sergeant...

21:49.409 --> 21:51.077
for your loyalty...

21:52.545 --> 21:54.381
and your friendship.

21:59.752 --> 22:00.920
Ah, kakka.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.523
Onoda-kakka.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.094
Sergeant, leave us.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.068
You saw the Nazi broadcast?

22:16.135 --> 22:17.269
Hai, kakka.

22:17.404 --> 22:18.871
Then you are aware

22:18.938 --> 22:21.408
of what the defector
Oberführer Diels
brought to us.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.643
I am aware
he brought evidence

22:23.710 --> 22:25.812
regarding the shooting
of Our Royal Highness.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.514
Evidence?

22:27.580 --> 22:30.750
He was sent by the Nazis
to provoke us.

22:30.817 --> 22:32.318
This so-called evidence--

22:32.419 --> 22:38.090
he claimed His Royal Highness
was shot by the Nazis--

22:38.157 --> 22:39.792
and we knew that
to be false,

22:39.859 --> 22:41.494
and we didn't
take the bait.

22:41.561 --> 22:45.498
So now they invent
a new lie...

22:46.899 --> 22:50.102
that Japanese agents
assassinated

22:50.169 --> 22:51.804
their führer.

22:53.272 --> 22:56.443
It is propaganda,
Kido-tai'i.

22:58.277 --> 23:03.049
The lie justifies what we
both know will happen next.

23:08.455 --> 23:10.022
And this city...

23:11.458 --> 23:14.961
will be one of the first
Nazi targets.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.363
Kakka,

23:17.464 --> 23:19.632
we must evacuate
our nuclear scientists.

23:19.699 --> 23:22.769
I have already given
the order,

23:22.835 --> 23:26.473
and the rest of us will
remain at our posts.

23:28.475 --> 23:32.111
This will be our last war,
Kido-tai'i.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.013
And it pleases me

23:34.080 --> 23:36.983
that we will fight this
together.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.518
Is everything
all right, Otousan?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.581
I have a favor to ask
of you, Juliana.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.168
Otousan?

25:41.608 --> 25:42.875
Yeah.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.278
Why do you want that?

25:48.447 --> 25:52.251
Proof that something
like this

25:52.318 --> 25:53.986
should never happen again.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.325
But I don't understand.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.996
You all have made me happy--

26:04.063 --> 26:07.099
Happier than I've been
in a very long time.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.640
There are some things
that are more important
than happiness.

26:15.141 --> 26:20.212
I have duties elsewhere
that I can no longer neglect.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.816
Are you leaving?

26:32.524 --> 26:35.394
We will see
each other again.

26:35.461 --> 26:38.297
Of that I am sure.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.174
Oh, don't go.
I'll be right back.

27:08.728 --> 27:09.996
My apologies,
Finance Minister.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.998
As I explained yesterday,

27:12.064 --> 27:14.166
the Trade Minister has
many other interests.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.737
I say his men will be able

27:17.804 --> 27:19.138
to help with important matters

27:19.205 --> 27:21.307
that are concerning you
at this time.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.612
Konichiwa,
Finance Minister Mori.

27:26.713 --> 27:31.017
If you will please
excuse us.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.785
Kotomichi.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.541
You've got it bad
for this one.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.177
Not like that.
Jules is different.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.446
She must be because I've
rarely seen you for weeks.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.814
Yeah, I'm sorry. It was--

28:01.881 --> 28:03.449
It was rough at first.
She couldn't be alone.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.751
And then, when she
could be alone,

28:04.751 --> 28:07.854
I-- I didn't want
to leave her alone.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.489
- Oh, one thing.
- Yeah.

28:10.556 --> 28:11.657
When you meet her,

28:11.758 --> 28:12.959
you can talk
about anything,

28:13.025 --> 28:14.827
except don't ask
about the accident.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.662
- Okay?
- Yeah. Got it.

28:16.763 --> 28:18.765
It's just it's
her first day out.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.767
I-- I don't
want to upset her.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.234
Okay, I got it.

28:30.877 --> 28:32.044
Hey, you made it.

28:32.111 --> 28:33.212
I did.

28:40.519 --> 28:43.555
Ed, this is, uh, Jules.

28:43.622 --> 28:44.656
Hi.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.826
Hi. He talks
so much about you,

28:46.893 --> 28:48.127
I really want to hug you,
but I--

28:48.194 --> 28:50.797
That's okay.
We can hug later.

28:53.866 --> 28:55.367
Ed, where'd you
put the glasses?

28:55.434 --> 28:57.036
- I thought you had them.
- No.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.404
It's okay.
Don't worry.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.839
Uh, wait here, okay?

28:59.906 --> 29:01.040
Don't go anywhere.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.976
Oh, uh, watch her,
will you?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.120
I don't actually
need watching.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.824
I suppose I did
at some point, but...

29:19.025 --> 29:20.426
Frank got in the habit,
I think.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.063
For that matter,
who even needs a glass?

29:35.207 --> 29:37.509
Tastes better than
hospital beer, I bet.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.512
You know,
I had the worst time

29:40.579 --> 29:42.181
getting decent
hospital beer.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.520
Frank told me you had
a pretty long hospital
stay yourself.

29:48.587 --> 29:50.857
Yeah. My lungs.

29:50.890 --> 29:52.724
Mustard gas really
did a number on them.

29:52.859 --> 29:55.327
Frank was great.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.796
He'd come by
pretty much every day,

29:57.864 --> 29:59.265
sit at my bed

29:59.331 --> 30:01.533
and tell me stories
from the outside.

30:03.169 --> 30:05.404
I guess I can say
it kept me sane.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.806
Without Frank, I probably
wouldn't be here.

30:07.874 --> 30:11.410
Well, we've got that
in common.

30:18.284 --> 30:20.052
Did he, uh,
did he ask you

30:20.119 --> 30:22.354
not to say anything
about the accident?

30:24.156 --> 30:25.424
Yeah.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.196
I can talk about it.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.934
I, uh...

30:37.736 --> 30:40.106
after everything
that happened,

30:40.172 --> 30:42.608
which is a long story,

30:42.674 --> 30:44.176
I, uh...

30:45.744 --> 30:47.213
I lost hope.

30:49.748 --> 30:50.983
And one day I found myself

30:51.050 --> 30:53.585
standing on a busy
street corner and...

30:55.922 --> 30:57.423
feeling completely alone,

30:57.489 --> 31:00.092
and I just made
a split-second choice.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.699
But I survived because,
as it turns out,

31:07.766 --> 31:09.135
I'm not alone.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.940
And I've had a lot of time
to think about that choice,

31:14.006 --> 31:15.274
and I know...

31:17.543 --> 31:18.844
it was the wrong one.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.446
I guess you could say

31:20.512 --> 31:22.949
you found yourself
a little bit of hope.

31:26.118 --> 31:27.954
I think I did.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.968
Edward.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.103
Edward?

31:44.170 --> 31:46.005
Edward!
Have you been listening?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.339
Do you have any more
room in there?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.976
No. There's no room.
It's full.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.077
Can you
pare it down a bit?

31:51.143 --> 31:52.178
We need to make
space for this.

31:52.244 --> 31:53.545
What are we going to do
with that

31:53.612 --> 31:54.580
in the Neutral Zone?

31:54.646 --> 31:56.315
We don't intend to do

31:56.382 --> 31:58.250
anything with it,
Mr. McCarthy.

31:58.317 --> 32:00.586
An objet does not
serve a function.

32:00.652 --> 32:04.890
Its value lies entirely
in its aesthetic.

32:04.991 --> 32:05.992
Hey, I need those.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.526
You must understand.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.895
Where we're going, there is
a total absence of culture.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.863
This vase dates back to 1798.

32:11.998 --> 32:13.832
It has a story, a history.

32:13.899 --> 32:15.267
Those are my pants.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.037
Well, I'm sure
they have a story, too,

32:18.104 --> 32:19.605
but just not one
I'm eager to hear.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.473
I have one bag. You've
already packed four trunks.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.009
Mr. Frink will help us
with the load,

32:23.075 --> 32:24.310
won't you, Mr. Frink?

32:27.313 --> 32:28.280
Frank.

32:36.722 --> 32:38.324
You didn't tell them,
did you?

32:39.725 --> 32:41.227
They would have killed you.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.263
But by not telling them,
I'm risking their lives.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.765
Damn it, Frank, how many
times do I have to tell you?

32:46.832 --> 32:49.501
I didn't say anything about
them to the kempeitai.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.203
Yeah, I believe you.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.373
How did you know

32:54.440 --> 32:55.674
the kempeitai
didn't follow you?

32:55.741 --> 32:56.708
tap our phones,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.244
bug the place?

33:02.081 --> 33:06.652
Childan, where's the cash
from the cufflink sale?

33:06.718 --> 33:08.220
Just one moment,
please.

33:08.287 --> 33:12.291
I've, uh, already
divided it

33:12.358 --> 33:14.093
into three equal shares.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.727
Go ahead and count it.

33:15.794 --> 33:18.364
Be my guest. I assure you
it's all there.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.740
I don't want that.
Why would I want your share?

33:28.807 --> 33:31.710
You find Jules if you can,

33:31.777 --> 33:33.479
and you tell her...

33:39.118 --> 33:41.087
Just tell her she was right.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.322
You're not their brother,

33:43.389 --> 33:45.291
no matter what they call you.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.725
If you're looking
for a family,

33:46.792 --> 33:47.759
you've got two of us:

33:47.826 --> 33:49.095
Jules and me.

34:01.140 --> 34:02.608
Fine.

34:02.674 --> 34:05.177
But take your share.
I don't want it.

34:10.116 --> 34:11.517
I'm not going to need it.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.532
Are you well,
Trade Minister?

34:26.598 --> 34:28.667
So very tired.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.607
But I suspect
you know the reason why.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.445
You're not from this world,
Kotomichi.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.214
Trade Minister--

34:42.281 --> 34:44.049
I learned in the other world

34:44.150 --> 34:46.685
defeat of our empire,

34:46.752 --> 34:49.821
the destruction of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

34:49.888 --> 34:51.523
where you were injured.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.336
My family, friends...

35:05.937 --> 35:07.406
perished in the bombing.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.975
As I lay in the hospital

35:10.041 --> 35:12.077
recovering from my burns,

35:12.178 --> 35:14.613
I learned
to escape the pain...

35:16.014 --> 35:18.217
in my body and my mind.

35:21.287 --> 35:24.190
By accident,
I found myself here.

35:25.491 --> 35:29.428
A happier world
where my family survived.

35:31.297 --> 35:36.735
I believe there's a reason
for my traveling, my powers.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.673
The armies
in the other world

35:41.740 --> 35:45.511
made their atomic
weapons larger,

35:45.577 --> 35:48.113
some a thousand
times stronger

35:48.214 --> 35:51.283
than the one
dropped on Nagasaki.

35:52.784 --> 35:57.689
I fear that they
will eventually
destroy themselves.

35:59.525 --> 36:03.529
If General Onoda does not
listen to reason,

36:03.595 --> 36:06.798
then I must speak to the
Crown Prince immediately.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.902
Arrange for my trip
with great haste.

36:10.969 --> 36:12.571
Trade Minister,

36:12.638 --> 36:16.308
travel to Japan is not
possible at this time.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.646
We will soon be at war.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.381
What?

36:23.282 --> 36:24.916
Hitler is dead.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.386
Poisoned.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.489
And the Nazis
have blamed the Empire.

36:30.556 --> 36:33.359
I fear your warning
comes too late.

36:38.797 --> 36:42.768
There may be one last
hope, Kotomichi.

36:44.636 --> 36:45.971
There are Resistance actions

36:46.037 --> 36:47.273
happening in every region

36:47.339 --> 36:49.841
from Miami to Concord,

36:49.908 --> 36:52.378
and there are similar reports
coming from the Pacific States.

36:52.444 --> 36:55.547
We knew the Resistance
would try to take advantage
of the Führer's death.

36:55.614 --> 36:58.183
Yes, but we haven't seen
this level of coordination

36:58.284 --> 36:59.385
since the end of the war.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.287
We should have
put it down then.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.754
We'll put it down now.

37:02.821 --> 37:03.789
Yes, sir.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.361
Excuse me, gentlemen.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.636
You Railings?

37:19.037 --> 37:20.506
At ease, son.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.714
So what are we looking at?

37:28.780 --> 37:31.483
This is Julia Mills'
dormitory,

37:31.550 --> 37:32.651
Obergruppenführer.

37:32.718 --> 37:37.356
And this...
is what I picked up.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.351
Thomas. Hi.
Are you okay?

38:05.351 --> 38:07.419
May I come in?

38:07.486 --> 38:08.987
Uh, sure.

38:09.054 --> 38:12.358
D-Do your parents
know you're here?

38:16.027 --> 38:18.397
What happened to me

38:18.464 --> 38:21.367
at the--
at the funeral...

38:23.369 --> 38:27.238
Y-Y-You felt--
You felt faint.
You were upset.

38:27.373 --> 38:28.974
No.
I know that's a lie.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.377
Please.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.645
Please, Julia,tell me.

38:35.581 --> 38:37.649
Just how sick am I?

38:39.885 --> 38:41.086
Really.

38:43.822 --> 38:44.990
I, uh...

38:54.933 --> 38:56.402
Thomas.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.005
Thomas,

39:00.071 --> 39:02.674
I am so touched
that you came to me,

39:02.741 --> 39:04.075
but you've got to go home

39:04.142 --> 39:05.877
and talk to your parents
about this.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.246
My parents aren't
telling me the truth

39:08.313 --> 39:10.582
about what's really
wrong with me.

39:10.649 --> 39:13.084
I looked up my symptoms
in the library.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.486
And the books all say

39:14.553 --> 39:16.488
the signs point
to a serious defect.

39:16.555 --> 39:19.525
All of us have flaws,
every single one of us.

39:19.591 --> 39:20.859
It makes us who we are.

39:20.926 --> 39:22.794
What if my flaws
are the kind

39:22.861 --> 39:25.096
that people vanish
for-- for the good--

39:36.207 --> 39:37.676
Thank you.

39:39.578 --> 39:42.748
Thank you for
notifying me directly.

39:49.721 --> 39:52.023
Have you shown this
to anyone else?

39:52.090 --> 39:53.158
No, sir.

39:57.362 --> 39:59.130
Yeah, I think
I'm going to need this.

40:16.047 --> 40:17.282
Hello.

40:17.348 --> 40:19.050
Helen, it's me.

40:19.117 --> 40:20.486
Have you found Lucy?

40:20.552 --> 40:23.321
No, but we're
looking everywhere.

40:23.388 --> 40:26.558
Uh, listen, honey,

40:26.625 --> 40:28.794
have you seen Thomas?

40:28.860 --> 40:32.030
No. Why?

40:32.097 --> 40:34.466
You haven't happened
to have seen, uh,

40:34.533 --> 40:36.067
Julia Mills.

40:37.469 --> 40:38.570
No.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.806
Why are you asking?

40:40.872 --> 40:42.874
It's nothing
to worry about.

40:42.941 --> 40:46.411
If you hear
from either of them,

40:46.478 --> 40:49.715
you just let me know.
Okay?

40:50.949 --> 40:51.950
Of course.

40:58.256 --> 41:00.025
I want them found, Erich.

41:08.099 --> 41:13.338
This is between seats
on the right-hand side.

41:13.404 --> 41:15.841
You park the car
in position.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.678
You flip the switch,
start the timer,

41:19.745 --> 41:21.713
and you get the hell
out of there.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.715
How long have I got?

41:23.782 --> 41:26.652
Plenty, as long as you head
straight for the exit.

41:26.718 --> 41:30.021
Frank, push this one
on this side of the car.

41:30.088 --> 41:32.290
If you don't, it'll
go off immediately.

41:32.357 --> 41:35.226
So you don't have to spend
your last hours in Earth

41:35.293 --> 41:37.563
in excruciating pain.

41:37.596 --> 41:39.364
Think you can
handle it?

41:39.430 --> 41:41.600
Yeah, Yeah,
if it comes to it.

41:41.667 --> 41:45.203
I got to say, Frank,
you are full of surprises.

41:47.238 --> 41:48.306
Are we going to hug now?

41:48.373 --> 41:50.141
Okay, then.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.944
You need this
and those.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.280
You know the part,
right?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.616
Yeah. Wait. We didn't
talk about her.

41:57.683 --> 41:59.117
You're driving in
as a chauffeur, Frank.

41:59.184 --> 42:01.587
The only way that's going
to work is with a passenger.

42:01.620 --> 42:02.788
She'll be
Onoda's niece.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.055
That sounds
pretty flimsy.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.391
"Niece" is Pon code
for mistress.

42:06.457 --> 42:08.426
The guy at the gate
won't make a fuss.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.829
The general's
calling for a girl
on the brink of war?

42:10.896 --> 42:12.598
It's not a perfect
plan, Frank.

42:12.664 --> 42:13.699
- It's our best shot.
- No. No.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.433
We never talked
about her coming.

42:15.500 --> 42:16.668
It's not your decision.

42:16.735 --> 42:18.036
I've already been
an asshole to you.

42:18.103 --> 42:19.504
I don't intend
to get you killed.

42:19.605 --> 42:20.839
Oh, that's a lousy
apology.

42:20.906 --> 42:22.473
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.875
I'm coming.

42:25.711 --> 42:28.714
I drive.

42:32.183 --> 42:33.151
Kido-tai'i.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.253
Good day
to you, Inspector.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.855
Trade Minister.

42:36.922 --> 42:39.490
Your absence has been
a matter of great concern.

42:39.625 --> 42:40.926
There's a more urgent matter

42:40.992 --> 42:43.028
that we must discuss
immediately.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.796
There are other duties
that require

42:44.863 --> 42:46.497
my full attention
at the moment.

42:46.632 --> 42:50.301
Yes. A war soon to be.
I understand.

42:50.368 --> 42:54.305
What I have to say may ensure
the survival of our empire.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.209
I will come to your office
as soon as I can get away.

42:58.276 --> 43:01.012
No. I will come to you
immediately.

43:23.168 --> 43:24.269
Konichiwa.

43:24.335 --> 43:26.738
I've brought
General Onoda's niece.

43:50.862 --> 43:52.463
What's going on?

43:52.530 --> 43:54.332
I'm not sure yet.

44:06.611 --> 44:08.346
It's not working.

44:16.855 --> 44:17.923
There is no record.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.357
You will wait here

44:19.424 --> 44:20.826
until we reach the general.

44:39.745 --> 44:41.913
Next time, make
proper arrangements

44:41.980 --> 44:45.083
so the general's niece
does not suffer embarrassment.

45:01.800 --> 45:06.237
It is now clear
that the Nazi dream

45:06.304 --> 45:10.776
is a world in which
we no longer exist.

45:10.842 --> 45:14.645
To them, like the Jews

45:14.780 --> 45:18.549
and the Slavs and the Gypsies,

45:18.616 --> 45:21.386
we are something foreign.

45:22.921 --> 45:27.192
Thus, the war machine
of the Reich...

45:28.493 --> 45:32.931
is poised to attack us.

45:33.865 --> 45:36.534
The men in this room

45:36.601 --> 45:38.804
may not live to see sunrise,

45:38.804 --> 45:44.475
but our grandchildren
will survive.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.177
And...

45:46.244 --> 45:54.820
we must never forget
the Empire is immortal.

45:56.822 --> 45:58.656
- Banzai!
- Banzai!

45:58.723 --> 46:01.726
Banzai! Banzai!

48:06.484 --> 48:10.121
The way we soldiers
face death today--

48:10.188 --> 48:11.957
Trade Minister
Tagomi has arrived.

48:11.957 --> 48:16.127
...will be history's
greatest demonstration

48:16.194 --> 48:18.629
of Japanese courage.

48:38.716 --> 48:39.684
Hai.

48:46.257 --> 48:49.594
We will speak with the
Trade Minister in my office.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.664
Frink.

52:02.187 --> 52:03.288
Hi.

52:03.354 --> 52:04.989
- Hi.
- What?

52:05.055 --> 52:06.824
Uh, nothing. We were
waiting for you,

52:06.891 --> 52:08.593
for the toast.

52:08.659 --> 52:09.994
All right.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.762
What shall we toast to?

52:11.829 --> 52:13.498
Uh, to us?

52:15.200 --> 52:16.501
The three of us.
