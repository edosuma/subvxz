of my head the things

02:02.404 --> 02:04.306
that he was so stern about.

02:04.306 --> 02:09.078
That makes it difficult. I need
to see some type of commitment

I asked you to move to Tampa,
thinking it'd be a good thing.

think that you, uh-- would

be plucked from your home.

02:33.435 --> 02:34.503
I don't know if I can do that.

If somebody asked me to do
it, I don't know if I could.

08:59.221 --> 09:00.255
No, thank you.

09:00.255 --> 09:02.457
Wait, Brie, I have
a question though.

09:02.457 --> 09:04.192
Summer, she's my riding partner.

09:04.192 --> 09:05.427
So what do I do?

09:05.427 --> 09:06.628
Is she allowed on the bus?
Or no?

09:06.628 --> 09:07.429
Yeah.

09:07.429 --> 09:10.065
She can come because I'd
feel bad not inviting her.

09:10.065 --> 09:11.967
I just don't know if I want
to ride, if Summer's on it.

09:11.967 --> 09:13.502
Like--
-Why?

09:13.502 --> 09:15.170
We couldn't be the same
locker room this weekend.

09:15.170 --> 09:18.006
There's this tension
between Nattie and Summer.

09:18.006 --> 09:21.276
But I think Summer is
a sweet person inside.

09:21.276 --> 09:23.579
And I'm hoping that
this fun, little,

09:23.579 --> 09:26.348
bus tour will get
Nattie to see, maybe,

09:26.348 --> 09:27.816
Summer's, like, good side.

09:27.816 --> 09:28.617
I don't know.

09:28.617 --> 09:31.019
She's just very passive
aggressive with me.

09:31.019 --> 09:33.055
And so I said, well, I'm
going to just change out in

09:33.055 --> 09:34.156
the middle of the hallway then.

09:34.156 --> 09:34.957
Yeah.

09:34.957 --> 09:37.392
I get really irritated with her.

09:37.392 --> 09:38.193
Whoa.

09:38.193 --> 09:39.494
What about the
other Funkadactyls?

09:39.494 --> 09:40.796
You can't take one
without the other?

09:40.796 --> 09:41.597
Yeah.

09:41.597 --> 09:42.664
Sorry, Ariane's allowed, too.

09:42.664 --> 09:44.666
We should have played you
and say she's not invited.

09:44.666 --> 09:46.702
Totally.

09:46.702 --> 09:48.537
This looks fun.

09:48.537 --> 09:49.738
-Oh, hey, girl.
-Hey, Summer.

09:49.738 --> 09:51.106
-Hey.
-What's up?

09:51.106 --> 09:51.907
How are you guys doing?

09:51.907 --> 09:54.576
Eva, girlfriend, we
have a photo shoot.

09:54.576 --> 09:55.377
I have all your stuff.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.945
I've been calling
you all morning.

09:56.945 --> 09:58.447
We haven't gotten our
breakfast yet though.

09:58.447 --> 10:01.350
Oh, well, we got to go.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.851
They've been, like,
calling my phone nonstop.

10:02.851 --> 10:04.019
I've been texting you, too.

10:04.019 --> 10:05.153
I'm sorry.

10:05.153 --> 10:05.954
Bye, guys.

10:05.954 --> 10:06.888
-But--
-Bye!

10:06.888 --> 10:07.689
Bye, guys.

10:07.689 --> 10:08.490
Don't worry, girl.

10:08.490 --> 10:09.891
We'll pay for your [BLEEP].

10:09.891 --> 10:10.826
[LAUGHING]

10:10.826 --> 10:11.627
Just put it on my tab.

10:11.627 --> 10:12.427
I got you, Eva!

10:12.427 --> 10:14.029
Thank-- Thank you, Nikki.

10:14.029 --> 10:15.397
Put something on for me!

10:15.397 --> 10:17.532
So Summer doesn't think
that Eva needs to finish

10:17.532 --> 10:18.700
up her conversation with us.

10:18.700 --> 10:19.801
It's annoying.

10:19.801 --> 10:21.703
But I do need to
invite her on the bus.

10:21.703 --> 10:23.038
Give her a chance
to show herself.

10:31.947 --> 10:33.715
So breakfast smelled good.

10:33.715 --> 10:35.851
I guess I just wasn't invited?

10:35.851 --> 10:37.586
Were they just talking
about me the whole time?

10:37.586 --> 10:40.956
Um-- well, you came in,
storming in like crazy!

10:40.956 --> 10:43.592
Girl, Corono has been
stalking me all morning.

10:43.592 --> 10:44.626
He's like, where's you and Eva?

10:44.626 --> 10:45.727
You and Eva need to come!

10:45.727 --> 10:46.528
No.

10:46.528 --> 10:49.197
I just got the text
from Nikki and Brie.

10:49.197 --> 10:53.201
So Brie and Bryan
are trying to think,

10:53.201 --> 10:55.003
like, we're going to
try the whole bus thing,

10:55.003 --> 10:55.837
because, you know--

10:55.837 --> 10:57.039
Oh, wow.

10:57.039 --> 11:01.243
The catch is, Brie thinks it's
a bright idea for all of us

11:01.243 --> 11:03.311
to be on the bus, right?

11:03.311 --> 11:04.312
So--

11:04.312 --> 11:05.113
Including me?

11:05.113 --> 11:07.482
Brie was like,
yeah, that's fine.

11:07.482 --> 11:08.917
And then Nattie--

11:08.917 --> 11:10.619
Oh, I'm sure Nattie
had a problem with that.

11:10.619 --> 11:14.656
Immediately was like, um--
I don't know about this.

11:14.656 --> 11:15.457
Or--

11:15.457 --> 11:17.192
Nattie talks about everyone.

11:17.192 --> 11:20.462
At the end of day, every
single girl on this roster,

11:20.462 --> 11:21.730
Nattie has run her mouth about.

11:21.730 --> 11:22.531
Mm hm.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.499
If she focused
that much time she

11:24.499 --> 11:28.236
does about running her mouth on
other people into her career,

11:28.236 --> 11:30.539
then maybe she would be
Diva's Champ right now.

11:30.539 --> 11:32.240
It's like, why is
she worried about--

11:32.240 --> 11:34.509
Because your blonde, dude!

11:34.509 --> 11:37.379
And she's like-- you're,
legit, her threat.

11:37.379 --> 11:38.980
Maybe if it gets
a little cold, I

11:38.980 --> 11:41.783
can borrow one of Nattie's
double breasted blazers.

11:41.783 --> 11:43.285
Ew!

11:43.285 --> 11:46.688
And her nice, like, button to
the top, like, high collared

11:46.688 --> 11:47.556
blouse.

11:47.556 --> 11:48.890
Totally.

11:48.890 --> 11:50.292
The shoulder pads.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.193
You're a performer.

11:51.193 --> 11:53.528
You're not an NFL linebacker.

11:53.528 --> 11:56.932
Pack some weapons in your
bag, some stiletto heels--

11:56.932 --> 12:00.702
not Nattie's, one
inch, grandma shoes.

12:00.702 --> 12:04.072
As long as I have your
back and you have mine--

12:04.072 --> 12:04.906
Red and gold, dawg.

12:04.906 --> 12:05.707
Red and gold.

12:12.013 --> 12:14.516
Bitch, you got to work!

12:14.516 --> 12:16.485
Hello, girls!

12:16.485 --> 12:17.719
Are we doing Instagram?

12:17.719 --> 12:19.821
I'll get out of the frame.

12:19.821 --> 12:21.957
You look good!

12:21.957 --> 12:23.225
We can sit down, girls.

12:23.225 --> 12:25.961
I, um-- I locked myself
out of my Instagram account.

12:25.961 --> 12:28.497
I, um-- have some
exciting news.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.364
Yeah.

12:29.364 --> 12:30.398
What is it?

12:30.398 --> 12:33.702
I get to go to Afghanistan.

12:33.702 --> 12:36.571
Every year, WWE
goes to Afghanistan.

12:36.571 --> 12:39.241
And it's a huge
deal because you get

12:39.241 --> 12:42.878
to go show respect to
everyone in the armed forces.

12:42.878 --> 12:45.714
And it's just, like, the
most amazing experience ever.

12:45.714 --> 12:48.116
I'm extremely honored
that Vince picked me.

12:48.116 --> 12:49.184
I mean, I'm brand new.

12:49.184 --> 12:49.985
I'm a newbie.

12:49.985 --> 12:52.387
So all red everything
is taking over.

12:52.387 --> 12:54.222
I've always seen
pictures of, like,

12:54.222 --> 12:56.892
the WWE, like, private jet.

12:56.892 --> 12:58.460
And I'm getting to go on it.

12:58.460 --> 13:00.862
All red everything
is about to go.

13:00.862 --> 13:02.764
Just all read everything, girl!

13:02.764 --> 13:03.832
Oh, damn!

13:03.832 --> 13:05.433
You put a little extra
on it right there.

13:05.433 --> 13:06.234
Yes.

13:06.234 --> 13:07.803
I just found out.

13:07.803 --> 13:10.238
Eva gets chosen to
go, which is amazing.

13:10.238 --> 13:13.008
But it's just like, OK, when
you just put extra-- like I'm

13:13.008 --> 13:15.277
riding on the jet, I'm
going to be with Vince,

13:15.277 --> 13:16.178
Vince hand chose me.

13:16.178 --> 13:18.547
It's like, Eva is still
considered a newbie.

13:18.547 --> 13:19.648
You have to come
in here and just

13:19.648 --> 13:21.216
be very humble and
gracious for what you have.

13:21.216 --> 13:22.250
Well, no, it's exciting that--

13:22.250 --> 13:23.819
She's just like, all
red everything-- it's

13:23.819 --> 13:24.820
like, it's all red everything!

13:24.820 --> 13:26.021
Oh!
Oh!

13:26.021 --> 13:26.822
My name is Eva!

13:26.822 --> 13:27.622
Yes!

13:27.622 --> 13:28.490
I've got the red hair.

13:28.490 --> 13:30.926
This is me being real.

13:30.926 --> 13:31.793
Seriously.

13:31.793 --> 13:32.594
I don't know.

13:32.594 --> 13:34.629
When you, like,
gloat, and, like,

13:34.629 --> 13:36.631
just act like you're
just the best thing

13:36.631 --> 13:37.899
that's ever happened
life, that's when

13:37.899 --> 13:38.800
it becomes really annoying.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.235
And one thing I've
learned about here

13:40.235 --> 13:42.671
is that today, you
can be the cats meow.

13:42.671 --> 13:45.140
And tomorrow, you'll be whatever
the hell is in the little box.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.141

in our careers,

Mm hm.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.618
I am so excited for the

I think my tooth is gone.

But eventually, you
know, to get this fixed,

16:18.126 --> 16:19.761
we'll have to put
a post up there

16:19.761 --> 16:21.396

16:24.099 --> 16:25.934
Unfortunately, in the
ring, pretty much anything

16:25.934 --> 16:28.370
can happen from bumps,
and bruises, and blood,

16:28.370 --> 16:30.338
and heaven forbid, you
get a tooth knocked out.

a tooth, isn't it?

16:39.047 --> 16:41.149
I don't want to get an implant.

16:41.149 --> 16:41.916
Ew.

16:41.916 --> 16:43.118
They're going to have to drill
all the way up in your gum.

16:43.118 --> 16:44.285
Don't!

16:44.285 --> 16:45.086
Ew!

16:45.086 --> 16:46.888
I look like a bum, huh?

16:46.888 --> 16:48.356
No.

16:48.356 --> 16:49.357
No.

16:49.357 --> 16:52.360
You got to get it
fixed though, Nicole.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.661
John's going to
think I'm hideous.

16:53.661 --> 16:54.462
Ew!

16:54.462 --> 16:56.064
He's not going to
think your hideous.

16:59.434 --> 17:02.437
John and I just made things
right in our relationship.

17:02.437 --> 17:04.806
And we've just been
back on cloud nine.

17:04.806 --> 17:09.344
And now, I feel like this
gapped, freak of nature--

17:09.344 --> 17:12.714
and I don't want John to see
me because all I want to do

17:12.714 --> 17:14.115
is make out with his face.

17:14.115 --> 17:15.683
I am like a bloody mess.

17:15.683 --> 17:17.886
Um-- do you guys have
anymore room on that bus?

17:17.886 --> 17:18.685
Yeah.

17:18.685 --> 17:19.721
Yeah, why?

17:19.721 --> 17:21.656
Well, I don't want
to see John like this.

17:21.656 --> 17:22.857
You got to be kidding.

17:22.857 --> 17:23.992
I look ugly, like a bum.

17:23.992 --> 17:24.792
No, you don't.

17:24.792 --> 17:25.894
I just don't want to see him.

17:25.894 --> 17:28.296
Your boyfriend should be
the first person you go to.

17:28.296 --> 17:30.231
Nicole, John will probably be
mad that you didn't tell me.

17:30.231 --> 17:31.299
I just want to go on the bus.

17:31.299 --> 17:32.100
Fine.

17:32.100 --> 17:33.201
You can come.

17:33.201 --> 17:34.469
But let's go wash your face.

17:34.469 --> 17:35.270
Yeah.

17:35.270 --> 17:36.771
Let's get you cleaned up.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.545
[CHEERING]

17:44.712 --> 17:45.513
Wow!

17:45.513 --> 17:47.749
Isn't this nice?

17:47.749 --> 17:50.952
I am so excited for the
first night on the bus

17:50.952 --> 17:53.822
because I kind of haven't hung
out with girls in a while.

17:53.822 --> 17:56.825
And I'm just excited to kick
back, have some wine, food,

17:56.825 --> 17:58.326
and just enjoy the ride.

17:58.326 --> 17:59.127
What's up, TJ?

17:59.127 --> 18:00.962
TJ.

18:00.962 --> 18:02.964
So there's bunks in the
back to put your stuff.

18:02.964 --> 18:03.898
Yeah.

18:03.898 --> 18:05.300
Oh, this is nice!

18:09.471 --> 18:10.605
Is everyone on the bus?

18:10.605 --> 18:12.273
I think so.

18:12.273 --> 18:15.110
So you guys, Bryan
has a couple rules.

18:15.110 --> 18:17.846
Rule number one-- no
pooping on the bus.

18:17.846 --> 18:18.646
What?

18:18.646 --> 18:20.281
And no tampons, if
you're on your period.

18:20.281 --> 18:21.082
Ew!

18:21.082 --> 18:23.651
And obviously,
no sex on the bus.

18:27.522 --> 18:28.389
Everyone have fun--

18:28.389 --> 18:30.125
But the second
you get annoying,

18:30.125 --> 18:32.293
you're getting
booted off the bus.

18:32.293 --> 18:34.596
No, you did not
just point at me!

18:34.596 --> 18:36.164
We're here for four hours.

18:36.164 --> 18:38.833
Maybe I should go
back on John's bus.

18:43.771 --> 18:45.740
I wish you got us sushi.

18:45.740 --> 18:46.975
This isn't John's bus.

18:46.975 --> 18:49.077
Is John's bus like this?

18:49.077 --> 18:49.978
Way nicer.

18:49.978 --> 18:50.778
Oh.

18:50.778 --> 18:51.579
No offence.

18:51.579 --> 18:53.481
When I got on here, I wish
I was back on his bus.

18:53.481 --> 18:55.049
Well, Nikki might be
the first kicked off.

18:55.049 --> 18:55.483
Yeah.

18:55.483 --> 18:56.985
You probably could on there,
but he might kick you back off.

18:56.985 --> 18:58.453
She could be kicked
off, just like her tooth.

18:58.453 --> 18:59.254
Oh!

18:59.254 --> 19:00.155
He didn't kick me off.

19:00.155 --> 19:01.623
I am toothless.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.491
So painful to eat,

19:03.491 --> 19:04.325
Did you have to see doc?

19:04.325 --> 19:05.160
What did he say?

19:05.160 --> 19:06.928
He said I have
to get an implant.

19:06.928 --> 19:07.795
That's why I'm on the bus.

19:07.795 --> 19:09.464
I can't go make out
with my boyfriend.

19:09.464 --> 19:10.298
He'll think I'm ugly.

19:10.298 --> 19:11.266
Oh my gosh.
You have issues.

19:11.266 --> 19:12.066
Oh my gosh!

19:12.066 --> 19:13.835
You can't even see it.

19:13.835 --> 19:14.802
There it is!

19:14.802 --> 19:16.070
There it is!

19:16.070 --> 19:16.871
There it is!

19:21.242 --> 19:24.445
You have no wine opener
and you got really [BLEEP]

19:24.445 --> 19:26.447
wine, but whatever.

19:26.447 --> 19:28.550
Quite frankly, you don't
need to be drinking, Nicole.

19:28.550 --> 19:28.816
Yeah.

19:28.816 --> 19:30.718
Well, I'm just going to
crack open the champagne then.

19:30.718 --> 19:31.653
Oh!

19:31.653 --> 19:33.054
[BLEEP]!

19:33.054 --> 19:34.155
Oh!

19:34.155 --> 19:35.790
How about-- let's
play truth or dare?

19:35.790 --> 19:37.525
I haven't played truth or
dare since middle school.

19:37.525 --> 19:39.761
Nattie, you have to ask
someone, truth or dare?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.796
Summer, I have a
question for you.

19:41.796 --> 19:44.699
Have you ever slept
with anybody at work?

19:44.699 --> 19:45.633
Whoa!

19:45.633 --> 19:46.434
Oh!

19:46.434 --> 19:48.469
Oh!

19:48.469 --> 19:50.638
You got to keep it-- you
got to keep it 100 now, girl.

19:50.638 --> 19:51.272
Yeah.
No.

19:51.272 --> 19:52.173
That's not hard.

19:52.173 --> 19:53.608
Why did everyone freak out?

19:53.608 --> 19:55.009
Is there rumors about me?

19:55.009 --> 19:56.244
[LAUGHING]

19:56.244 --> 19:57.045
There is.

19:57.045 --> 19:59.814
I don't hear any rumors
that I've heard rumors.

19:59.814 --> 20:01.816
Really?

20:01.816 --> 20:05.587
Bryan's a top in the WWE, so to
hear him say that he had heard

20:05.587 --> 20:08.323
this before was completely
different than all

20:08.323 --> 20:10.024
these girls just
running their mouth

20:10.024 --> 20:12.060
and trying to start
drama with me.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.229
I think it's the cutest thing
when Summer acts innocent.

20:14.229 --> 20:15.196
It's not innocent.

20:15.196 --> 20:17.465
I'm just telling y'all no.

20:17.465 --> 20:19.534
And I want to know who.

20:19.534 --> 20:21.202
Actually, I don't know,
if I want to know.

20:21.202 --> 20:22.070
Summer, your turn.

20:22.070 --> 20:22.870
OK.

20:22.870 --> 20:25.607
TJ, is Nattie the best
sex you've ever had?

20:25.607 --> 20:27.976
What if I said, the only.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.378
Oh!

20:30.378 --> 20:31.346
That is so cute!

20:34.983 --> 20:37.051
She doesn't have a lot of ammo.

20:37.051 --> 20:40.788
That's why she wears such
little outfits in the ring.

20:40.788 --> 20:42.190
It's your turn, TJ.

20:42.190 --> 20:43.191
This game's a bit rough, huh?

20:43.191 --> 20:44.959
It's probably cause I just
asked you, truth or dare?

20:44.959 --> 20:47.028
I know how she gets with
her men, and Eva, and--

20:47.028 --> 20:49.063
Actually, Eva and I are
getting along just fine.

20:49.063 --> 20:53.701
So it's just whoever's new on
the bottom you're intimated by?

20:53.701 --> 20:55.870
I, honestly,
can't put my finger

20:55.870 --> 20:59.574
on what it is about Summer that
really doesn't gel with me.

20:59.574 --> 21:01.442
Sometimes we'll have to
work together in the ring.

21:01.442 --> 21:03.244
And she, honestly, impresses me.

21:03.244 --> 21:05.446
But the little act that
she's an innocent lamb

21:05.446 --> 21:08.416
is something I'm not,
personally, buying anymore.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.684
It's always hot
when Summer's around.

21:09.684 --> 21:10.852
So it's your turn.

21:10.852 --> 21:13.221
Oh!

21:13.221 --> 21:14.188
It's true.

21:18.459 --> 21:19.327
Stop being a little girl.

21:19.327 --> 21:20.561
And you need to talk to John.

21:20.561 --> 21:21.362
Ew.

21:21.362 --> 21:23.131
I don't want him to
see me like this.

21:23.131 --> 21:24.766
Brie!

21:24.766 --> 21:25.767
Talk to him!

21:25.767 --> 21:26.868
I don't want to!

21:26.868 --> 21:28.603
Will you talk to him?

21:28.603 --> 21:31.272
Eva-- she has like some
scandalous pictures.

21:31.272 --> 21:32.640
Here's one.

21:32.640 --> 21:34.642
This is a little
more than bikini pics.

21:37.111 --> 21:37.912
Yeah.

21:47.188 --> 21:51.859
Nattie, I just want you
to give TJ a lap dance.

21:51.859 --> 21:54.796
[LAUGHING]

22:02.503 --> 22:04.272
Here's to Eva's
secret marriage,

22:04.272 --> 22:05.273
my tooth gone missing--

22:05.273 --> 22:06.641
Me getting the bus!

22:06.641 --> 22:08.276
Wait, you guys, I have
something to cheer about!

22:08.276 --> 22:09.544
Bryan getting the bus!

22:09.544 --> 22:13.414
I just got the cover of
"Rolling Out" magazine.

22:13.414 --> 22:14.515
No!

22:14.515 --> 22:15.316
Which one?

22:15.316 --> 22:16.150
"Rolling Out."

22:16.150 --> 22:16.951
[LAUGHING]

22:16.951 --> 22:17.885
[BLEEP].

22:17.885 --> 22:18.820
I didn't mean that!

22:18.820 --> 22:20.054
I thought you said-- I didn't
know if you said "Rolling

22:20.054 --> 22:21.189
Stone" or something out.

22:21.189 --> 22:21.989
No. "Rolling Out."

22:21.989 --> 22:22.890
Good job, girl!

22:22.890 --> 22:25.960
It's like a new, upcoming--
but a lot of celebs have-- TI

22:25.960 --> 22:27.495
did it, Snoop Dog, Meagan Good.

22:27.495 --> 22:28.296
Oh, that's great.

22:28.296 --> 22:29.097
Yeah.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.398
Guess who's getting
Maxim Hot 100?

22:30.398 --> 22:31.199
You?

22:31.199 --> 22:32.533
-You?
-Yes, I am!

22:32.533 --> 22:33.434
Oh my gosh!

22:33.434 --> 22:34.268
Congratulations!

22:34.268 --> 22:35.069
Aw!

22:35.069 --> 22:36.204
That's awesome?

22:36.204 --> 22:37.004
Really?

22:37.004 --> 22:39.173
I'm always really happy for
when someone gets something,

22:39.173 --> 22:41.909
but it's really annoying when
Eva makes it seem like she's

22:41.909 --> 22:42.977
better than everyone else.

22:42.977 --> 22:45.413
It's like, can you just
be happy for someone else?

22:45.413 --> 22:47.548
Why are you always try to
steal someone's thunder?

22:47.548 --> 22:48.649
Now do you get
to re-shoot or are

22:48.649 --> 22:50.184
they using your old picture?
-No.

22:50.184 --> 22:50.985
I'm going to re-shoot.

22:50.985 --> 22:52.186
-Oh, that's awesome.
-Yeah.

22:52.186 --> 22:53.121
That's freaking awesome.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.055
Cheers, bitches!

22:54.055 --> 22:54.856
Cheers!

23:01.529 --> 23:02.730
Eva, where are you going?

23:05.032 --> 23:05.833
See?

23:05.833 --> 23:07.568
She's totally touching herself.

23:07.568 --> 23:09.003
No, you're probably
about to go back there

23:09.003 --> 23:10.705
and touch yourself
until you see John.

23:10.705 --> 23:13.007
I'll admit, if I was the first
to go back there, the covers

23:13.007 --> 23:14.142
would be up and I'd be like--

23:14.142 --> 23:15.843
Oh my god, Nikki!

23:15.843 --> 23:17.412
I'm going to go to bed guys.

23:17.412 --> 23:18.346
Whatever.

23:18.346 --> 23:19.147
Ew!

23:19.147 --> 23:21.382
I thought you
were my other half.

23:21.382 --> 23:22.784
I have a photo shoot
early in the morning.

23:22.784 --> 23:24.419
Nattie, do you have a
photo shoot in the morning?

23:24.419 --> 23:26.988
I'm not important enough
to have one this month.

23:26.988 --> 23:28.589
I didn't say that.

23:28.589 --> 23:29.490
I'm just kidding.

23:29.490 --> 23:31.159
But you said it,
so there it is.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.360
OK, guys.

23:32.360 --> 23:33.327
See you!

23:33.327 --> 23:34.128
Goodnight.

23:34.128 --> 23:36.063
Night, night.

23:36.063 --> 23:37.932
Too comfortable.

23:37.932 --> 23:39.500
Look, it's not like we
have to sit there and go

23:39.500 --> 23:42.870
through this crazy initiation
with new girls that come up,

23:42.870 --> 23:44.572
but it's just etiquette.

23:44.572 --> 23:45.807
Is that crazy?

23:45.807 --> 23:46.607
No.

23:46.607 --> 23:48.609
A lot of times, like,
the new girls come up

23:48.609 --> 23:51.012
and then they show no respect.

23:51.012 --> 23:52.079
Like with Eva.

23:52.079 --> 23:53.781
I feel like she makes
herself seem like she's just,

23:53.781 --> 23:55.016
like, better than everyone.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.784
I'm not trying to be like
a little bit, but I'm like,

23:56.784 --> 23:58.586
I just want to see where
this girl comes from.

23:58.586 --> 24:00.087
And, you know,
everyone has, like,

24:00.087 --> 24:01.222
skeletons in their closet.

24:01.222 --> 24:03.157
She has, like, some
scandalous pictures.

24:03.157 --> 24:03.958
Here's one.

24:07.628 --> 24:10.998
Oh, [BLEEP].

24:10.998 --> 24:11.833
That sucks.

24:11.833 --> 24:12.633
Yeah.

24:12.633 --> 24:17.238
I guess this is a little
more than bikini pics.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.373
Well, you know, we all go
through a time in our life

24:19.373 --> 24:20.808
that we're not proud of.

24:20.808 --> 24:22.443
I think Eva had one
of those moments.

24:22.443 --> 24:24.412
Definitely not
proud of that one.

24:24.412 --> 24:25.613
Yeah.

24:25.613 --> 24:27.281
I feel like there's a
sadness in Eva's eye.

24:27.281 --> 24:28.082
Yeah.

24:28.082 --> 24:30.651
I would be embarrass if
those pictures got of me.

24:46.501 --> 24:47.969
Hey, ladies.

24:47.969 --> 24:49.704
I had some tea to share.

24:49.704 --> 24:50.838
-Does this involve me at all?
-No.

24:50.838 --> 24:51.639
It doesn't.

24:51.639 --> 24:52.707
Cause I was not really
trying to hear it.

24:52.707 --> 24:53.941
-Oh.
-Sandra!

24:53.941 --> 24:55.109
It's like a private--

24:55.109 --> 24:56.110
-Sandra!
-What?

24:56.110 --> 24:56.911
OK.

24:56.911 --> 24:58.045
Look what I found.

24:58.045 --> 24:59.113
Oh my god.

24:59.113 --> 25:00.781
That's even a swimsuit.

25:00.781 --> 25:02.049
That's a freaking Band-Aid.
-OK.

25:02.049 --> 25:03.684
Let's see now if
Vince is going to be

25:03.684 --> 25:06.087
very happy at seeing stuff
like that on the internet.

25:06.087 --> 25:07.822
And there's like so many more.

25:12.894 --> 25:13.728
Ambrose, you look great.

25:13.728 --> 25:15.196
You look like--
-Yeah.

25:15.196 --> 25:16.230
It looked like you leaned out.

25:16.230 --> 25:17.632
You were totally
checking him out, Nattie.

25:17.632 --> 25:19.300
Well--

25:19.300 --> 25:20.268
I am.

25:22.136 --> 25:23.738
It's still sore.

25:23.738 --> 25:24.572
Where's John?

25:24.572 --> 25:27.408
I'm hiding from him still.

25:27.408 --> 25:28.910
Nicole, you're
being ridiculous.

25:28.910 --> 25:30.611
Nikkie is beyond ridiculous.

25:30.611 --> 25:33.180
Why would John care
if you lost a tooth?

25:33.180 --> 25:34.849
Speaking of John--

25:34.849 --> 25:36.884
Don't say anything
about the tooth.

25:36.884 --> 25:37.685
Are you really hiding?

25:40.521 --> 25:41.956
I'm so embarrassed right now.

25:47.094 --> 25:48.629
Oh, look at your hair!

25:48.629 --> 25:49.530
Oh my god.

25:49.530 --> 25:50.965
Did your mom do that?

25:50.965 --> 25:51.766
Stop!

25:51.766 --> 25:52.567
Stop it, Candy.

25:52.567 --> 25:55.169
I got to go look at
some routines, dawg.

25:55.169 --> 25:57.271
You're looking good, girl.

25:57.271 --> 25:58.239
Hey, y'all.

25:58.239 --> 25:59.740
Summer Rae.

25:59.740 --> 26:00.875
What's going on?
-Nothing.

26:00.875 --> 26:02.276
I'm on my way to still photo.

26:02.276 --> 26:04.679
So have you seen the,
uh-- the Eva pictures?

26:04.679 --> 26:05.680
What do you mean?

26:05.680 --> 26:06.847
Like on dot com?

26:06.847 --> 26:07.648
Like--

26:07.648 --> 26:09.617
Um-- they're on dot come,
but it's not WWE dot com.

26:09.617 --> 26:10.418
Yeah.

26:10.418 --> 26:11.218
It's-- yeah.

26:11.218 --> 26:13.154
I think there might be a
couple Xs before the dot com.

26:13.154 --> 26:14.388
And maybe even after.

26:17.191 --> 26:18.492
-That's not Eva.
-Yeah, it is.

26:18.492 --> 26:19.760
Well, how do y'all
know about this?

26:19.760 --> 26:20.561
-They're circulating everywhere.
-No.

26:20.561 --> 26:21.362
It's insane.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.064
Around the guy's locker room?

26:23.064 --> 26:23.864
Um-- yeah.

26:23.864 --> 26:24.966
I mean, I got them.

26:24.966 --> 26:27.401
I feel really bad for Eva.

26:27.401 --> 26:28.469
They're pretty risky.

26:28.469 --> 26:31.839
I think Ariane first found
them, but I could be wrong.

26:31.839 --> 26:34.442
I'm going to tell Eva now that
those pictures are circulating.

26:34.442 --> 26:35.242
Cause that's my friend.

26:35.242 --> 26:36.143
She's had my back.

26:36.143 --> 26:37.912
I haven't heard anything
from the other girls.

26:37.912 --> 26:39.280
That's cause girls
all hate each other.

26:39.280 --> 26:40.548
That's-- that's the damn truth.

26:40.548 --> 26:41.515
But then they hug each other.

26:41.515 --> 26:43.584
I don't know what's
going on, but this is just

26:43.584 --> 26:47.888
a very manipulative,
backstabbing side of Ariane

26:47.888 --> 26:49.323
that I've never seen.

26:54.795 --> 26:57.865
My man knows when I'm
hiding something from him.

26:57.865 --> 26:59.767
I assumed that we were going
to be traveling together.

27:03.137 --> 27:04.772
That's why I came
to your fucking face

27:04.772 --> 27:06.407
instead of like
you, running around.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.408
That's like malicious [BLEEP].

27:07.408 --> 27:09.143
If there are pictures
that you're ashamed of,

27:09.143 --> 27:10.578
maybe you need to stop
thinking that you're

27:10.578 --> 27:11.646
better than everybody else.

27:23.457 --> 27:25.426
TV ANNOUNCER 1: We're back
on "Friday Night SmackDown."

27:25.426 --> 27:26.427
We're set for Pre.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.396
Bella to go one on
one with Tamina Snuka.

27:28.396 --> 27:30.865
I want to talk first
about what happened

27:30.865 --> 27:31.866
this past Monday night on Raw.

27:31.866 --> 27:33.834
We're actually going to
show you the footage now.

27:33.834 --> 27:36.303
And it looked here
like Nikki Bella

27:36.303 --> 27:37.772
was about to put
you away when Tamina

27:37.772 --> 27:39.206
kicked Nikki right in the face.

27:39.206 --> 27:41.175
TV ANNOUNCER 3: You know, if
you watch that in slow motion,

27:41.175 --> 27:45.146
you can pin point the exact
moment where she forgets mask.

27:45.146 --> 27:47.381
I know Tamina did not mean
to knock Nikki's tooth out.

27:47.381 --> 27:50.484
She is a trained
professional, but I'm

27:50.484 --> 27:52.987
definitely looking forward
to a little bit of payback

27:52.987 --> 27:55.556
right now.

27:55.556 --> 27:58.559
[CHEERING]

28:01.595 --> 28:04.098
Come on, Brie!

28:04.098 --> 28:05.266
TV ANNOUNCER 2: Brie countered!

28:05.266 --> 28:06.067
Shoulders down.

28:06.067 --> 28:07.068
And Brie--

28:07.068 --> 28:07.868
[BELL RINGING]

28:07.868 --> 28:09.070
Picks up the victory.

28:09.070 --> 28:10.538
And AJ's flipping out!

28:10.538 --> 28:11.539
Oh, man!

28:11.539 --> 28:13.040
Talk about a pie face!

28:13.040 --> 28:14.041
She had to love that.

28:14.041 --> 28:17.511
That had to feel
great for Brie Bella.

28:17.511 --> 28:19.013
Not only did Brie
get the victory,

28:19.013 --> 28:21.482
but she got a little bit
of retribution as well.

28:21.482 --> 28:23.451
The Divas of the
Year, the Bella twins!

28:27.922 --> 28:29.423
-Nice match.
-Thanks.

28:29.423 --> 28:30.391
Like, did you hear the crowd?

28:30.391 --> 28:32.259
Even on the replay, did
your hear the crowd?

28:32.259 --> 28:33.994
But have you talked to John yet?

28:33.994 --> 28:35.429
Do not--

28:35.429 --> 28:36.230
Shh.

28:36.230 --> 28:37.531
Nicole, stop
being a little girl

28:37.531 --> 28:38.933
and you need to talk to John.

28:38.933 --> 28:40.601
I don't want to.

28:40.601 --> 28:41.402
You know what?

28:41.402 --> 28:44.905
You're sounding like a little,
prissy, vain girl to me.

28:44.905 --> 28:47.742
The fact that you don't want to
see him because of your look--

28:47.742 --> 28:49.677
who cares?

28:49.677 --> 28:50.578
It's more than that.

28:50.578 --> 28:51.946
How is it more than that?

28:51.946 --> 28:54.448
When John hurt his elbow, who
was right there, beside him?

28:54.448 --> 28:55.349
Me.

28:55.349 --> 28:56.117
OK.

28:56.117 --> 28:57.585
And who wants to be
right for your side

28:57.585 --> 28:59.120
if they found out about this.
-Ugh!

28:59.120 --> 29:00.154
Him.
-OK.

29:00.154 --> 29:00.955
And then--

29:00.955 --> 29:02.223
It's just so gross looking.

29:02.223 --> 29:03.023
And like--

29:03.023 --> 29:06.560
And most importantly, when
was the last time you had sex?

29:06.560 --> 29:08.329
That's actually really true.

29:08.329 --> 29:09.130
That's a good point.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.831
Well.

29:10.831 --> 29:15.269
I'm usually a very confident
person, but in this situation,

29:15.269 --> 29:18.773
I was just like, ew, I don't
want him to see me like this.

29:18.773 --> 29:22.009
At the same time, two
days without sex-- no.

29:22.009 --> 29:23.344
That is not OK.

29:23.344 --> 29:24.745
Brie!

29:24.745 --> 29:25.813
Talk to him!

29:25.813 --> 29:26.614
OK.

29:26.614 --> 29:27.414
Fine.

29:27.414 --> 29:28.282
Will you talk to him?

29:28.282 --> 29:29.049
Yes.

29:29.049 --> 29:30.084
Tap.

29:30.084 --> 29:31.519
Tap.

29:31.519 --> 29:34.388
Tap.

29:34.388 --> 29:35.823
There you go.

29:35.823 --> 29:37.091
I can't believe
you just did that.

29:37.091 --> 29:38.058
Go.

29:38.058 --> 29:38.859
Ow.

29:38.859 --> 29:39.660
You hit me in my vagina.

29:39.660 --> 29:42.463
Well, the vagina
needed some action.

29:42.463 --> 29:43.764
Come on.
-Ow!

29:43.764 --> 29:44.732
That hurts.

29:44.732 --> 29:45.699
Let's go freshen you up.

29:52.506 --> 29:53.474
What's up?

29:56.377 --> 29:57.378
Are you OK?

29:57.378 --> 29:58.179
Mm hm.

30:04.919 --> 30:08.088
My man knows when I'm
hiding something from him.

30:08.088 --> 30:09.323
Principal's office.

30:09.323 --> 30:10.124
Now.

30:13.294 --> 30:18.265
I assumed that we were going
to be traveling together.

30:18.265 --> 30:20.734
What did I do now?

30:20.734 --> 30:22.236
What do you mean,
what did you do now?

30:22.236 --> 30:23.103
I don't know.

30:23.103 --> 30:26.841
You-- sometimes you--

30:28.742 --> 30:29.777
I don't get it.

30:29.777 --> 30:32.479
I lost my tooth.

30:32.479 --> 30:33.347
OK.

30:33.347 --> 30:35.316
Like, it's a tooth.

30:35.316 --> 30:36.383
If anything, I'm proud of you.

30:36.383 --> 30:37.184
My woman's tough.

30:37.184 --> 30:39.386
Really?

30:39.386 --> 30:40.988
Nicole, why would you
ever think that something

30:40.988 --> 30:42.223
like that would matter?
-I don't know.

30:42.223 --> 30:43.524
I just felt insecure.

30:43.524 --> 30:46.493
I thought I looked-- I
was like an ugly bum.

30:46.493 --> 30:48.162
Your smile's infectious.

30:48.162 --> 30:51.398
Even with one missing.

30:51.398 --> 30:54.468
I am feeling like
such a doofus.

30:54.468 --> 30:56.103
My man loves me no matter what.

30:56.103 --> 30:58.706
And if anything, he thinks
now I'm more beautiful.

30:58.706 --> 30:59.907
Even minus one tooth.

30:59.907 --> 31:00.708
I mean, come on!

31:00.708 --> 31:02.443
What do you guys think?

31:02.443 --> 31:05.746
I mean, is it that bad?

31:05.746 --> 31:06.747
Yes.

31:06.747 --> 31:07.548
It is.

31:09.149 --> 31:12.419
As long as you
promise no tooth jokes.

31:12.419 --> 31:13.454
No jokes.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.255
That's the tooth.

31:17.324 --> 31:18.559
I'm totally kidding.

31:24.932 --> 31:26.867
SUMMER RAE: Let's get this
party on the road, guys!

31:32.773 --> 31:33.807
Cam, that's like your t-shirt.

31:33.807 --> 31:34.708
Right?

31:34.708 --> 31:36.310
Like, that's the label
like your t-shirt.

31:36.310 --> 31:37.111
Mm.

31:37.111 --> 31:38.646
No, it's not bye,
bye, it's girl bye.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.446
Oh.

31:39.446 --> 31:40.314
Girl bye.

31:40.314 --> 31:41.882
Yes.

31:41.882 --> 31:43.918
I'm about to get my
all red everything shit.

31:43.918 --> 31:46.620
Well, I mean, I wasn't
done talking about my girl

31:46.620 --> 31:47.755
bye shirt, but good for you.

31:47.755 --> 31:48.555
Yeah.

31:48.555 --> 31:49.356
Thanks.

31:51.258 --> 31:52.059
What?

31:53.560 --> 31:56.397
I think it is my place to
tell Eva what's going on.

31:56.397 --> 32:00.801
I think anyone who maliciously
goes into your past

32:00.801 --> 32:02.536
and looks for
things to bring you

32:02.536 --> 32:04.772
down-- showing
pictures and spreading

32:04.772 --> 32:05.873
these rumors about Eva.

32:05.873 --> 32:07.508
Of course, I'm going
to have Eva's back.

32:07.508 --> 32:10.778
Eva's going to walk into a room
and everyone's going to know

32:10.778 --> 32:12.913
what's going on except her.

32:12.913 --> 32:14.348
That's a crappy feeling.

32:14.348 --> 32:18.752
Um-- so Ariane's been showing
people you're old, racy photos.

32:21.522 --> 32:23.824
If they're the photos
that I think they are,

32:23.824 --> 32:25.192
they're disgusting.

32:25.192 --> 32:27.394
I'm completely
shocked and so caught

32:27.394 --> 32:29.096
off guard because
I don't really know

32:29.096 --> 32:30.698
how many people she showed.

32:30.698 --> 32:35.302
But she definitely has no
idea, by just bringing them up

32:35.302 --> 32:38.372
and showing these photos that
I did when I was like 20,

32:38.372 --> 32:40.107
how hurtful it is to me.

32:40.107 --> 32:41.608
First of all, say it to my face.

32:41.608 --> 32:42.409
Yeah.

32:42.409 --> 32:45.012
Don't be a little brat
and, like, run around

32:45.012 --> 32:46.013
to everybody that I work with.

32:46.013 --> 32:46.814
Yeah.

32:46.814 --> 32:48.482
If she has a problem
with me, that's fine.

32:48.482 --> 32:49.917
Like come and address me.

32:49.917 --> 32:53.754
I just can't believe it that--
I don't know-- that, I guess,

32:53.754 --> 32:54.855
she stopped to,
like, that level.

32:54.855 --> 32:55.856
Yeah.

32:55.856 --> 32:58.158
She's always saying that
she tells it how it is.

32:58.158 --> 32:59.193
She comes up to your face.

32:59.193 --> 33:01.061
You know, she doesn't need
to talk behind your back.

33:01.061 --> 33:01.962
Give me a break.

33:01.962 --> 33:04.598
I'm going to see, you know, if
there's truth behind whatever

33:04.598 --> 33:05.733
Summer was telling me.

33:05.733 --> 33:07.901
So I have something to say.

33:07.901 --> 33:09.670
Like I don't really
appreciate you

33:09.670 --> 33:12.806
going around and showing my
business to, like, everyone

33:12.806 --> 33:15.242
that we work with.

33:15.242 --> 33:17.678
First of all, you need
to relax and sit down

33:17.678 --> 33:19.413
because you are
standing above me, like,

33:19.413 --> 33:21.682
and talking to me like that.

33:21.682 --> 33:23.217
And if you do have a problem--
-I do.

33:23.217 --> 33:24.518
That's why I came
to your [BLEEP]

33:24.518 --> 33:26.754
face instead of like
you, running around

33:26.754 --> 33:27.888
to everybody that we work.
-OK.

33:27.888 --> 33:29.490
First off, I found those
pictures on Twitter.

33:29.490 --> 33:31.325
So you need to relax and
if there's pictures--

33:31.325 --> 33:32.126
Cool.

33:32.126 --> 33:33.327
Then come to [BLEEP] me.
-OK.

33:33.327 --> 33:34.728
If there are pictures that
you're ashamed of-- no one

33:34.728 --> 33:35.829
told you to do
nothing like that.

33:35.829 --> 33:37.598
Maybe you need to start
calming yourself down

33:37.598 --> 33:39.500
and stop thinking that you're
better than everybody else.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.801
Who said I was better
than everybody else?

33:40.801 --> 33:41.568
-You do it all the time.
-Really?

33:41.568 --> 33:42.069
Yes!

33:42.069 --> 33:43.537
If I think I'm better
than anybody else,

33:43.537 --> 33:45.406
I'm not going to bring
up their [BLEEP] dirt.

33:45.406 --> 33:46.373
-Yeah.
-Who does that?

33:46.373 --> 33:47.207
That's like malicious [BLEEP].

33:47.207 --> 33:48.475
You walk around
all the time, trying

33:48.475 --> 33:49.610
to act like you're just it.

33:49.610 --> 33:50.878
And, like, you put
other people down.

33:50.878 --> 33:51.678
And yeah.

33:51.678 --> 33:53.113
That is a way of
shutting you up.

33:57.351 --> 33:58.786
Hey, man.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.221
You all right?

34:01.221 --> 34:03.023
Oh, Eva!

34:03.023 --> 34:04.725
Don't cry on me right now!

34:04.725 --> 34:06.727
Those pictures mean
so much more to me

34:06.727 --> 34:09.596
because it kind of brings back
a past that I kind of thought,

34:09.596 --> 34:10.964
you know, I've overcome.

34:10.964 --> 34:12.699
Like they come at me,
like, that hard, too.

34:12.699 --> 34:13.500
Totally.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.301
We don't need that.

34:14.301 --> 34:16.770
But now it's like, if they
want to play like that,

34:16.770 --> 34:18.237
I'm coming to bat, you know?

34:22.576 --> 34:24.110
If I think I'm better
than anybody else,

34:24.110 --> 34:25.746
I'm not going to bring
up their [BLEEP] dirt.

34:25.746 --> 34:26.480
-Yup.
-Who does that?

34:26.480 --> 34:27.614
That's like malicious [BLEEP].

34:27.614 --> 34:28.982
You walk around
all the time, trying

34:28.982 --> 34:29.983
to act like you're just it.

34:29.983 --> 34:31.418
And, like, you put
other people down.

34:31.418 --> 34:32.219
And yeah.

34:32.219 --> 34:33.687
That is a way of
shutting you up.

34:36.857 --> 34:38.225
You're trying to embarrass me.

34:38.225 --> 34:39.659
You're embarrassing
yourself right now.

34:39.659 --> 34:40.094
How?

34:40.094 --> 34:41.295
For coming at me
and talking crazy.

34:41.295 --> 34:42.896
You just barge in here
and just start talking

34:42.896 --> 34:44.565
to me like you have no sense.

34:44.565 --> 34:45.364
Oops, your bad.

34:45.364 --> 34:46.233
Oops, not really.

34:46.233 --> 34:47.900
-Uh-- yes.
-Who brings up someone's past?

34:47.900 --> 34:49.335
They were pictures
out on the internet.

34:49.335 --> 34:50.603
They're my past pictures.

34:50.603 --> 34:52.272
But you have no idea what
was going on in my life

34:52.272 --> 34:53.474
at that time.
-Oh, OK.

34:53.474 --> 34:54.942
And clearly, I'm
in a different spot.

34:54.942 --> 34:56.543
So I just really don't
appreciate you trying to,

34:56.543 --> 34:58.812
like, bring up a
sensitive topic for me.

34:58.812 --> 34:59.680
OK.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.914
Well, um-- my bad.

35:00.914 --> 35:04.418
The fact that she sees, like,
no wrong in her doing to me

35:04.418 --> 35:05.486
is so bizarre.

35:05.486 --> 35:07.654
The last thing I want to do
is look at her because I just

35:07.654 --> 35:09.723
want to sock her in her face.

35:09.723 --> 35:12.426
I think I'm definitely
over this bus.

35:12.426 --> 35:14.728
I won't be riding on the
bus the rest of the week.

35:19.766 --> 35:21.201
Yay.
We're here.

35:21.201 --> 35:22.002
Goodnight, you guys.

35:25.072 --> 35:27.474
I'm completely over
everything on this bus.

35:27.474 --> 35:29.510
I just want to get off,
and get my own hotel room,

35:29.510 --> 35:30.911
and not be around anybody.

35:30.911 --> 35:31.712
Hey, man.

35:31.712 --> 35:32.713
You all right?

35:32.713 --> 35:33.714
No, I'm good.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.215
You sure?

35:35.215 --> 35:38.152
Oh, don't cry!

35:38.152 --> 35:39.520
Oh, Eva!

35:39.520 --> 35:40.988
Don't cry on me right now!

35:43.790 --> 35:45.759
Those pictures mean
so much more to me

35:45.759 --> 35:47.294
because it kind of
just brings back

35:47.294 --> 35:50.130
a past that I kind of thought,
you know, I've overcome.

35:50.130 --> 35:52.032
I was abusing alcohol.

35:52.032 --> 35:54.101
Things were just spiraling
out of control for me.

35:54.101 --> 35:55.669
And it was time for
me to make a change.

35:55.669 --> 35:57.538
And that change
was what's driven

35:57.538 --> 36:01.275
me to clean it up, and get
sober, and get on with my life.

36:01.275 --> 36:05.212
It's just like such a sore,
sensitive topic because, like--

36:05.212 --> 36:06.013
I know.

36:06.013 --> 36:08.482
I'm, like, sober now because
of, like, [BLEEP] like that.

36:08.482 --> 36:09.249
You know what I mean?

36:09.249 --> 36:10.551
But we all have a past.

36:10.551 --> 36:14.254
And that doesn't make her better
than you or any of us better

36:14.254 --> 36:15.055
than you.

36:15.055 --> 36:17.124
We all got skeletons,
you know what I mean?

36:17.124 --> 36:19.359
None of us don't want
things that we're

36:19.359 --> 36:22.196
not proud about to be
brought up in the present.

36:22.196 --> 36:23.463
Especially when
it's like-- you know,

36:23.463 --> 36:25.832
I feel like I've overcome a lot.

36:25.832 --> 36:28.135
And, like, I'm so happy
with where I'm at now.

36:28.135 --> 36:29.102
And you have.

36:29.102 --> 36:29.636
So it's like I
don't even want to go

36:29.636 --> 36:31.104
back to where I was, you know?

36:31.104 --> 36:32.139
But you have.

36:32.139 --> 36:33.974
She don't know [BLEEP]
about you, really.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.275
Don't let it get to you.

36:38.478 --> 36:40.681
One of the girls was showing
me some pictures of you.

36:40.681 --> 36:41.481
It was kind of weird.

36:41.481 --> 36:42.282
Thanks.

36:42.282 --> 36:44.351
At this point, the
entire boy's locker room

36:44.351 --> 36:47.254
has seen these pictures.

36:47.254 --> 36:48.121
Ow!

36:48.121 --> 36:49.923
Guess-- who am I?

36:49.923 --> 36:50.824
Summer?

36:50.824 --> 36:51.625
Yeah.

36:51.625 --> 36:52.426
She came up.

36:52.426 --> 36:54.595
She goes, we're going
to be opening the show.

37:06.039 --> 37:07.040
[PHONE RINGING]

37:07.040 --> 37:08.242
JONATHAN: Hi, baby.

37:08.242 --> 37:09.042
Hi, babe.

37:09.042 --> 37:10.344
JONATHAN: What are you doing?

37:10.344 --> 37:12.212
I'm like so upset right now.

37:13.780 --> 37:17.417
Well, basically,
Ariane went ham on me.

37:17.417 --> 37:19.052
At this very moment,
I'd much rather

37:19.052 --> 37:21.755
stay in a hotel room
with Summer because I'm

37:21.755 --> 37:23.390
totally so over that bus.

37:29.429 --> 37:30.530
Um--
[KNOCKING]

37:30.530 --> 37:31.798
Oh, that's my door.

37:31.798 --> 37:34.301
I think it's Summer.

37:34.301 --> 37:35.769
Hey, what's going on?

37:35.769 --> 37:36.637
Is that your boo boo?

37:36.637 --> 37:37.437
Yeah.

37:37.437 --> 37:38.238
Hi.

37:40.073 --> 37:40.874
Yeah.

37:40.874 --> 37:42.342
I'm going to talk to
her for a little bit

37:42.342 --> 37:43.510
and then I'll call you back, OK?

37:44.945 --> 37:45.912
OK, bye, babe.

37:45.912 --> 37:46.880
Bye.

37:46.880 --> 37:48.482
Oh!

37:48.482 --> 37:49.283
Thank you.

37:49.283 --> 37:51.752
Summer has been
really cool throughout

37:51.752 --> 37:52.719
this whole situation.

37:52.719 --> 37:55.689
I'm definitely grateful she
has my back no matter what.

37:55.689 --> 37:56.857
-This affects your work.
-This is my career.

37:56.857 --> 37:57.758
-Yeah.
-This is my job.

37:57.758 --> 37:59.559
This is like-- what
if-- I don't know.

37:59.559 --> 38:01.295
This isn't like you did
something in the ring

38:01.295 --> 38:02.095
or something happened.

38:02.095 --> 38:04.364
She was blatantly digging
to attack you on something.

38:04.364 --> 38:05.165
Totally.

38:05.165 --> 38:05.966
And we don't need that.

38:05.966 --> 38:08.035
Like they come at me
like that hard, too,

38:08.035 --> 38:10.237
and I see that
they do it to you.

38:10.237 --> 38:13.340
And it just-- it comes from
a place of insecurity, so--

38:13.340 --> 38:14.675
But not it's
like, game on then.

38:14.675 --> 38:18.145
If they want to play like that,
I'm coming to bat, you know?

38:31.258 --> 38:32.092
There you are.

38:32.092 --> 38:33.093
I've been looking for you.

38:33.093 --> 38:33.894
What's up, girl?

38:33.894 --> 38:34.695
I need to talk to you.

38:34.695 --> 38:35.762
Come on.

38:35.762 --> 38:36.530
Oh.

38:36.530 --> 38:37.731
Step into my office.

38:37.731 --> 38:40.600
I know she's pissed off and
wanting to get back at Eva,

38:40.600 --> 38:43.170
but to bring up
someone's past, something

38:43.170 --> 38:47.040
that really hurts them, it
takes it to a whole other level.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.843
What the heck is going
on with you and Eva?

38:49.843 --> 38:51.712
I just feel like she's
always trying to, like,

38:51.712 --> 38:53.213
rain on someone's parade.

38:53.213 --> 38:56.883
But what would
possess you to go

38:56.883 --> 39:00.921
as far as pulling up her dirt?

39:00.921 --> 39:03.390
Like do you know about,
like, her past and, like,

39:03.390 --> 39:04.624
what those picture symbolize?

39:04.624 --> 39:05.425
Because--

39:05.425 --> 39:08.995
Like it's way deeper than
it just being a picture.

39:08.995 --> 39:11.798
Well, it wasn't like I was
maliciously trying to do it.

39:11.798 --> 39:13.900
Yeah, you were.

39:13.900 --> 39:15.202
Yes, you were.
-Yeah.

39:15.202 --> 39:16.970
But it's OK for her to just
rain on my moment and--

39:16.970 --> 39:17.771
No.

39:17.771 --> 39:21.108
It's not, but you lowered
yourself to make her look bad.

39:21.108 --> 39:25.245
Here's my thing, your-- your
mug shots are on the internet,

39:25.245 --> 39:26.046
right?

39:26.046 --> 39:28.782
Two years ago, I got
pulled over for a DUI.

39:28.782 --> 39:30.884
In my case, the thing
that was never said

39:30.884 --> 39:33.553
was that I was wrongly
accused and that I

39:33.553 --> 39:34.821
was found not guilty.

39:34.821 --> 39:37.524
And when that whole incident
happened, it was a whole mess.

39:37.524 --> 39:39.025
You were stereotyped.

39:39.025 --> 39:40.560
Think of like how
mad you get when

39:40.560 --> 39:43.296
people Tweet or say stuff about
that because they don't know--

39:43.296 --> 39:44.097
What the story was.

39:44.097 --> 39:45.499
You were falsely accused.

39:45.499 --> 39:48.568
So imagine her, like, bringing
something up like that to you.

39:48.568 --> 39:50.570
She was very hurt and upset.

39:50.570 --> 39:52.606
Like, she was crying
to me about it.

39:52.606 --> 39:53.407
She was crying?

39:53.407 --> 39:54.207
Yes.

39:56.009 --> 39:56.810
Damn.

39:56.810 --> 39:57.611
OK.

39:57.611 --> 39:58.845
I feel really bad now.

39:58.845 --> 40:01.014
Well, I hope you feel something
because it was-- it was shady.

40:08.221 --> 40:10.624
Looking good.

40:10.624 --> 40:12.058
Thanks.

40:12.058 --> 40:13.026
You see yet?

40:13.026 --> 40:14.494
What?

40:14.494 --> 40:16.096
The pictures.

40:16.096 --> 40:17.898
What do you mean?

40:17.898 --> 40:20.400
You know, one of the girls was
showing me some pictures of you

40:20.400 --> 40:21.334
back in the day.

40:21.334 --> 40:24.704
It was kind of-- kind of weird.

40:24.704 --> 40:25.505
Thanks.

40:25.505 --> 40:28.642
If Fandango has
seen these pictures,

40:28.642 --> 40:30.143
that means the
entire boy's locker

40:30.143 --> 40:31.578
room has seen these pictures.

40:31.578 --> 40:33.447
At this point, I'm
like, [BLEEP] it.

40:33.447 --> 40:35.715
But she went to my
workplace and that's,

40:35.715 --> 40:37.451
to me, the lowest of the low.

40:37.451 --> 40:38.418
I can't believe her.

40:49.863 --> 40:52.833
[CHEERING]

40:57.804 --> 40:59.206
Oh, hi.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.073
What are you doing?

41:00.073 --> 41:01.408
Stretching.

41:01.408 --> 41:02.742
A match with Tamina.

41:02.742 --> 41:05.212
Oh, cool.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.680
We are opening the show.

41:09.616 --> 41:10.784
Oh, hey!

41:10.784 --> 41:11.818
-You ready?
-Yes.

41:11.818 --> 41:12.652
I'm ready.

41:12.652 --> 41:13.453
We have to go.

41:13.453 --> 41:14.588
Ta, ta!

41:14.588 --> 41:15.589
I will talk to you later.

41:19.159 --> 41:19.960
[INAUDIBLE].

41:19.960 --> 41:21.394
Holler!

41:21.394 --> 41:23.330
REFEREE: Summer Rae!

41:23.330 --> 41:24.798
TV ANNOUNCER 1: Summer Rae.

41:24.798 --> 41:27.234
Mrs. Fandango!

41:27.234 --> 41:28.134
Ow!

41:28.134 --> 41:31.171
Guess-- who I am?

41:31.171 --> 41:33.540
Uh-- Summer?

41:33.540 --> 41:34.341
Yeah.

41:34.341 --> 41:35.141
She came up.

41:35.141 --> 41:38.411
She goes, we're going
to be opening the show.

41:38.411 --> 41:41.548
I'm like, [BLEEP] off.

41:41.548 --> 41:43.917
TV ANNOUNCER 1: Summer Rae
looking lovely tonight.

41:43.917 --> 41:46.353
TV ANNOUNCER 2: As compared--
she didn't lovely last week?

41:46.353 --> 41:48.255
TV ANNOUNCER 1: She looks
lovely all the time!

41:48.255 --> 41:51.658
[INAUDIBLE] fantastic!

41:51.658 --> 41:52.859
That's so sweet.

41:52.859 --> 41:54.227
Yes.

41:54.227 --> 41:55.328
Hey, Sandra.

41:55.328 --> 41:56.129
Hey, girl.

41:56.129 --> 41:56.930
How you doing?

41:56.930 --> 41:58.698
Hey, girl, do
you have a minute?

41:58.698 --> 41:59.833
Um-- sure.

41:59.833 --> 42:00.634
Can I talk to you?

42:00.634 --> 42:01.434
Yeah.

42:04.371 --> 42:06.706
I want to apologize to
Eva, so we can just kind of

42:06.706 --> 42:08.341
put all this stuff in the past.

42:08.341 --> 42:10.844
Trin came to me and she
said that you were really

42:10.844 --> 42:12.145
upset about the pictures.

42:12.145 --> 42:15.682
And that was like a time for
you that was a hard time.

42:15.682 --> 42:18.652
And it was a place that
you weren't happy to be at.

42:18.652 --> 42:19.819
And I didn't know that.

42:19.819 --> 42:22.022
And now I feel like
a complete [BLEEP]

42:22.022 --> 42:23.156
because that wasn't
my intention.

42:23.156 --> 42:26.359
If I knew that those pictures,
like, symbolized something very

42:26.359 --> 42:28.962
hurtful-- I just want to
apologize for that because that

42:28.962 --> 42:30.130
was wrong on my behalf.

42:30.130 --> 42:32.198
I appreciate you coming
to me and apologizing,

42:32.198 --> 42:36.202
but those photos, like, bring
up so much of, like, my past

42:36.202 --> 42:37.837
that I thought I had,
like, tucked away.

42:37.837 --> 42:42.342
And that's like a bitch move
to do because that's shady.

42:42.342 --> 42:44.744
You're like putting my [BLEEP]
on blast behind my back.

42:44.744 --> 42:46.313
And then I got to hear
it from everybody else.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.081
And now, when I walk into
a room, I'm embarrassed.

42:48.081 --> 42:50.850
There's no reason to even
bring that up at work.

42:50.850 --> 42:53.920
That's something between me and
you that has nothing remotely

42:53.920 --> 42:56.423
close to do with, like,
business whatsoever,

42:56.423 --> 42:57.958
except for you to humiliate me.

42:57.958 --> 43:01.561
Not only is it childish, but
it's extremely unprofessional.

43:01.561 --> 43:03.597
I just think she's
full of [BLEEP].

43:03.597 --> 43:04.798
-That wasn't my--
-Well done.

43:04.798 --> 43:05.498
Good job.
-That wasn't my intention.

43:05.498 --> 43:07.300
But I'm definitely not
accepting your apology.

43:17.577 --> 43:20.280
ANNOUNCER: Next week
on "Total Divas"--

43:20.280 --> 43:21.648
No erections on the bus!

43:21.648 --> 43:22.449
Weird.

43:22.449 --> 43:24.284
Summer actually came up
to me and she was like,

43:24.284 --> 43:25.986
I care what you think
about people thinking

43:25.986 --> 43:27.187
I've slept with somebody.

43:27.187 --> 43:28.221
I'm going to find her.

43:28.221 --> 43:30.690
Summer, when it
comes to my man-- no.

43:30.690 --> 43:33.760
That is a slutty, rude,
classless thing to do.

43:33.760 --> 43:35.295
You come out there
and you shake your ass.

43:35.295 --> 43:36.262
You practically wear nothing.

43:36.262 --> 43:37.063
Nattie--

43:37.063 --> 43:37.931
Divas are role models.

43:37.931 --> 43:38.732
Nattie, please!

43:38.732 --> 43:40.500
You're on the verge
of being a stripper!

43:40.500 --> 43:43.570
[GASPING]
