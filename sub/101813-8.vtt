HIGGINS:
For the laymen

08:07.530 --> 08:09.053

a pneumothorax is...

08:09.097 --> 08:10.968
Air in the pleural cavity,

08:11.012 --> 08:12.709
generally caused by
a punctured lung.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.668
See, the air can't escape,
so the pressure increases,

08:14.711 --> 08:16.191
compressing the heart, right?

08:16.234 --> 08:17.584
That's correct.

08:19.542 --> 08:21.544

08:21.588 --> 08:25.243
X-ray also revealed some sort
of odd metallic object.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.419
It could be what caused
the puncture, I'm not sure,

08:27.463 --> 08:29.900
but I asked Paul
if he had swallowed anything,

08:29.944 --> 08:31.859
or if he knew what it could be.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.730
He said "no."

Okay.

Where do we come in?I'm sorry. I'm getting there.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.082
I told him I needed
to do more imaging

08:38.126 --> 08:39.780
to better define the object.

08:39.823 --> 08:41.782
Then I would do surgery
to remove it

08:41.825 --> 08:42.913
and then repair the lung.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.567
But when the nurse
went to take him

08:44.611 --> 08:47.135
to CT, he was gone.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.223
He just left?

08:48.266 --> 08:49.877

Maybe he got scared.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.356

force him into anything.

he didn't come back.

a police matter.

09:44.192 --> 09:45.933
How much time do we have?

09:45.976 --> 09:49.589
Without surgical intervention,
the pneumo will likely expand,

09:49.632 --> 09:52.243
ultimately causing
cardiovascular collapse.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.594
If we don't do something soon,

09:54.637 --> 09:56.683
Paul will be dead
in a few hours.

10:05.517 --> 10:07.345

10:07.389 --> 10:08.651

like doctors.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.174
Well, aside

10:16.398 --> 10:17.617
a hundred tests and find out

10:17.660 --> 10:19.401
you either wasted
a bunch of money,

10:19.444 --> 10:21.229
or there's six
other things wrong with you.

10:21.272 --> 10:23.361
Is that the reason
that you refused

10:23.405 --> 10:25.712
to go to a doctor for
your recent bout of insomnia?

10:25.755 --> 10:27.191
Not going to the doctor
for something

10:27.235 --> 10:28.497
that's gonna fix itself.

10:28.540 --> 10:30.673
Ah, the old "ignore
the problem, and it will

10:30.717 --> 10:33.371
just go away" strategy,
yeah, 'cause that always works.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.679
Listen, if you do change
your mind, Ethan's up to speed.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.247
Yeah, apparently.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
Magnum,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.381
sleep is one of the most
important parts of your health,

10:43.425 --> 10:47.690
and you're suffering,
so I asked a doctor some advice.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.822
Is that a big deal?

10:48.865 --> 10:50.040
No.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.260
Anything else on Paul?

10:55.655 --> 10:58.005
I pinged his cell.
There's no signal.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.093
Looks like it's been off-line

10:59.136 --> 11:00.398
since he left the hospital.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.052
He hasn't made
any calls, either.

11:02.096 --> 11:03.706
We should go
to his house.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.708
I mean, if I'm not feeling well,
it's the first place I go.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.712
Unlike the rest of us,
who just go to a doctor.

11:09.756 --> 11:11.932
JOEY: <i>
Hurricane was coming,</i>

11:11.975 --> 11:13.411
you know, and they closed

11:13.455 --> 11:15.152
the Wrightsville
Beach Drawbridge.

11:15.196 --> 11:16.545
And I was on the
wrong side of it.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.068
[chuckles]:
How'd you get home?

11:18.112 --> 11:19.635
I-I swam.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.550
I got... I got cut up
on an oyster bed.

11:21.593 --> 11:25.380
It was, in hindsight, not
my best idea, you know.

11:25.423 --> 11:27.599
[chuckles]Yeah.

11:27.643 --> 11:29.645
When's the last
time you were home?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.126
[exhales]
Man, it's been a while,

11:32.169 --> 11:33.736
man.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.303
But this is home now.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.174
You know,
my two best friends--

11:37.218 --> 11:39.089
met 'em in the service--

11:39.133 --> 11:40.787
they live here, too.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.354
"Best friends"
doesn't do it justice.

11:43.398 --> 11:44.878
Those are my brothers.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.228
To the end.

11:48.838 --> 11:52.189
You know you don't have to
give me the hard sell, right?[laughs]

11:52.233 --> 11:53.364
[laughs]
Oh, got me.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.844
I mean, I-I wanted this

11:54.888 --> 11:56.280
before I even signed up.

11:56.324 --> 11:59.762
My dad, my uncle,
granddad-- all vets.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.416
And me following

12:01.459 --> 12:04.898
in their footsteps
means the world to them.

12:04.941 --> 12:06.769
I'm sure they'll be proud.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.903
But what's the draw for you?

12:10.904 --> 12:13.036
Lot of reasons, you know?

12:13.080 --> 12:15.430
[chuckles softly]

12:17.171 --> 12:20.783
Well, I guess, um...

12:20.827 --> 12:23.917
I love my country, you know?

12:25.005 --> 12:28.704
Joey, do you want to join up
for you or for your family?

12:29.618 --> 12:31.576
What's the difference?

12:31.620 --> 12:34.928
Long as I sign up, right?

12:41.412 --> 12:43.675
[indistinct chatter]

12:46.504 --> 12:49.159
Something wrong with it?

12:49.203 --> 12:52.554
No, uh, just kinda full.

12:55.644 --> 12:58.342
That sounds kind of suspicious.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.301
Let me see here.

13:02.694 --> 13:06.133
Oh! No, no, no, no.
That mahi's not even cooked.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.743
No. Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.832
You gotta say something
when that happens.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.181
You know, raw fish can kill you.How?

13:11.225 --> 13:12.530
It's just sushi, right?

13:12.574 --> 13:16.621
No. Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
So embarrassing.

13:16.665 --> 13:19.929
I'm sorry, my-my chef,
he moved back to Texas

13:19.973 --> 13:22.845
when COVID hit, and the new guy,
he could use...

13:22.889 --> 13:24.194
Cooking lessons?

13:24.238 --> 13:25.935
Yeah.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.808
[both laugh]

13:30.548 --> 13:32.768
The bartender go with him?

13:32.812 --> 13:35.771
Oh, no, he just stopped
showing up.

13:37.164 --> 13:38.774
[laughing]

13:38.818 --> 13:40.167
We've got all kinds
of problems. [chuckles]

13:40.210 --> 13:42.386
What's so funny?

13:42.430 --> 13:45.868
Our inability to retain
staff, apparently.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.435
TC, this is...Suzy.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.785
I remember. Your dad
had a houseboat

13:49.829 --> 13:52.483
in the marina,
named it after you.

13:52.527 --> 13:53.745
Kind of hard to forget.

13:53.789 --> 13:57.053
Right. I actually
just moved in there.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.446
Fell on some hard times,

13:58.489 --> 14:00.274
but Rick was kind enough
to let me do what I love

14:00.317 --> 14:02.015
and pay me for it.

14:03.581 --> 14:04.713
Uh, the wall that we replaced.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.410
The one that Booky
plowed through.

14:06.454 --> 14:09.892
Suzy's gonna snazz it up,
paint a mural for us.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.416
Oh. Nice. Of what?

14:12.460 --> 14:14.897
It's a surprise.
Rick didn't want to know.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.117
Well, I trust the artist.
You know, I want to leave it

14:17.160 --> 14:19.032
to her and her vision.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.252
And I won't let you down.

14:22.296 --> 14:23.601
And I better get back
to it, actually.

14:23.645 --> 14:26.430
Uh, thank you for
the... the meal.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.432
Yeah, well, next time
it won't be so bad.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.781
I promise.
Okay.

14:29.825 --> 14:30.913
All right.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.437
[chuckling]

14:33.481 --> 14:35.700
Suzy, huh?

14:36.832 --> 14:38.921
Come on.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.792
We were just talking.

14:40.836 --> 14:41.706
[laughs]

14:41.750 --> 14:43.447
How'd your recruiting talk go?

14:43.491 --> 14:45.232
Good, mostly.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.843
But there's this one kid
named Joey.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.454
I'm kind of worried about
his motivation for signing up.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.631
Well, mine was easy:
enlist or do time.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.329
And I wanted to fly, baby.

14:55.372 --> 14:56.591
Why is Joey doing it?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.810
To please his family.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.942
Oh.

14:59.986 --> 15:01.639
I'm not sure I
should get involved.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.207
I mean, who's to say what
the right reasons are?

15:04.251 --> 15:05.469
Well, whatever our
motivations were,

15:05.513 --> 15:06.601
we both wanted it.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.777
You can't do it
for somebody else.

15:08.820 --> 15:10.953
You're gonna have to talk
to that kid, lay it down.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.955
Yeah, well, I spoke to
the officer candidates

15:12.999 --> 15:14.304
as a favor to Mitch.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.046
What's he gonna say
if I talk Joey out of it?

15:17.090 --> 15:18.874
He's not gonna be happy.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.529
Look, it sucks, but
there's sometimes a cost

15:21.572 --> 15:23.009
to doing the right thing.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.013
[sighs]

15:40.026 --> 15:42.550
It doesn't look like
anyone's home.

16:09.229 --> 16:11.753
♪

16:13.233 --> 16:16.671
Doesn't appear to be
a woman of the house.

16:16.714 --> 16:17.802
I was about to say
the same thing.

16:17.846 --> 16:20.675
Looks like Paul and his dad

16:20.718 --> 16:22.807
and his brother, maybe?

16:22.851 --> 16:25.854
No indication
that Paul came home.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.644
Except for his
hospital bracelet.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.039
So he did come back.
Well, where'd he go?

16:37.083 --> 16:40.564
I don't know. He didn't make
any calls from his cell,

16:40.608 --> 16:42.044
but maybe he used
the land line.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.045
[phone beeps]

16:43.089 --> 16:45.830
Well, looks like...

16:45.874 --> 16:47.571
that number was
called an hour ago.

16:53.882 --> 16:56.276
Uh, you sure this is
the place Paul called?

16:56.319 --> 16:58.365
No, I'm only sure that
someone from the Wilson home

16:58.408 --> 17:01.020
called a phone at this location.I mean,
it can't be Paul.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.848
He can't breathe,
so he leaves the hospital

17:03.892 --> 17:06.286
and orders a muffin?
It doesn't make sense.

17:06.329 --> 17:08.984
Only one way to find out.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.035
Hi. Excuse me.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.429
Uh, do you know this man?
His name is Paul Wilson.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.735
Never seen him before.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.084
Well, maybe you
haven't seen him,

17:22.128 --> 17:24.086
but we believe he called here
about an hour ago.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.698
No one's called me all day.
You must be in the wrong place.

17:29.352 --> 17:32.181
What was that number again?Hang on.

going back there.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.507
[woman speaking indistinctly]

17:54.856 --> 17:56.814
Looks like an underground
medical clinic.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.773
See, now that makes sense.

18:00.166 --> 18:01.689
Hey, Doc.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.301
How did you get in here?

18:05.345 --> 18:07.782
This is a really nice place.
I'm guessing it's not,

18:07.825 --> 18:11.133
uh, what's the word... <i>legal.</i>

18:11.177 --> 18:13.004
I am a doctor.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.094
I'm just not licensed
in the U.S.

18:15.137 --> 18:17.400
But these people,
they can't afford proper care.

18:17.444 --> 18:19.359
They need me.

18:19.402 --> 18:22.144
My place.
Look, we're not here
to give you any trouble.

18:22.188 --> 18:25.191
We are just looking
for Paul Wilson.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.805
He was here, wasn't he?

18:30.848 --> 18:33.677
He's a good kid.
Just needed help.

18:33.721 --> 18:34.852
Well, we're trying
to help him.

18:34.896 --> 18:36.680
If he doesn't get surgery,

18:36.724 --> 18:37.812
he could die.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.684
I know. I said the same thing.

But they wouldn't hear it. Left.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.862
You said "they."

18:44.906 --> 18:46.734
Paul was with his brother,
Tanner.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.738
Well, this isn't exactly
an easy place to find.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.740
How did they know to come here?

18:52.783 --> 18:55.699
Because I helped them
once before, 12 years ago.

18:55.743 --> 18:57.962
[raspy breathing]He got shot.

in a tough spot.

hit any vital organs.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.318
I can leave the bullet
and patch him up,

19:05.361 --> 19:06.710
but I can't guarantee
he'll be okay.

19:06.754 --> 19:08.059
I urge you to go
to the hospital.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.584
We can't.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.154
Any idea who the shooter is?

19:15.197 --> 19:17.373
One of the draws of this place
is that

19:17.417 --> 19:18.809
I just want to help people,

19:18.853 --> 19:21.247
so I don't ask
too many questions.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.210
Mr. Wilson's child was shot.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.126
What could possibly justify not
going straight to a hospital?

19:31.170 --> 19:33.128
The doctors find a bullet,
they gotta call the cops.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.869
But why would Mr. Wilson
not want the police involved?

19:34.912 --> 19:37.088
I don't know. Maybe that's
why Paul took off.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.308
He doesn't want
that either.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.059
It's Sarge's birthday.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.289
I don't have any cash.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.725
Yes, I'm sorry about that.

20:04.768 --> 20:06.335
I don't actually think
I've ever played so well.

So well or so angry?

I want a rematch.

I promise you'll have one.

20:11.993 --> 20:13.037
And I might even
let you win.

In exchange for

20:14.300 --> 20:15.605
what favor you're about to ask

20:15.649 --> 20:17.477
that I may or may not agree to.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.089
Well, okay, there is a patient
of Dr. Shah's...

20:21.132 --> 20:23.483
You call your boyfriend
Dr. Shah?

20:23.526 --> 20:25.746
The kid's name is Paul Wilson.

20:25.789 --> 20:28.575
He's 22. He needs
immediate surgery.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.838
The problem is
we can't seem to find him.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.753
I'm running him now.
What's wrong with him?

20:32.796 --> 20:34.755
He was shot 12 years ago,

20:34.798 --> 20:36.931
and the bullet has now
punctured his lung.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.541
He would have been ten years old
at the time.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.108
Any idea what happened?

20:40.151 --> 20:41.544
No, not yet.

20:41.588 --> 20:44.373
I don't see anything.
You got any more details?

20:44.417 --> 20:45.592
He was a kid when he got shot.

20:45.635 --> 20:46.593
Maybe he's got
a juvie record.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.116
Yeah, those would be sealed.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.900
Might take some time
to look into.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.337
All right, I'll get right on it.

20:51.380 --> 20:52.990
Thanks, Gordie.Thank you.

20:53.034 --> 20:56.211
How does a ten-year-old end up
with a bullet inside him?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.995
Barring being a criminal,

20:58.039 --> 20:59.388
it can't have been
intentional.

20:59.432 --> 21:03.218
I mean, drive-by,
line of fire.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.828
Accident, maybe?

21:04.872 --> 21:07.527
You know what I don't understand
is the doctor at the clinic said

21:07.570 --> 21:10.225
that Mr. Wilson was a loving
and responsible father.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.183
Why would he not do
everything in his power

21:12.227 --> 21:13.837
to protect his son?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.535
Well, maybe he was trying
to protect his son.

21:15.578 --> 21:17.798
His <i>other</i>son.
Tanner?

21:17.841 --> 21:19.234
Yeah. I mean, it
wouldn't be the first time

21:19.278 --> 21:21.105
a couple of kids
got ahold of a gun

21:21.149 --> 21:22.281
and somebody
ended up shot.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.327
Maybe Tanner shot Paul.

21:25.371 --> 21:26.502
Maybe Mr. Wilson was worried

21:26.546 --> 21:28.678
that the police would
take Tanner away.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.163
Hey, man.

21:35.206 --> 21:37.165
You were right about this spot,

if it's my place,

21:49.525 --> 21:51.440
but since I tried to get you
to sign up,

21:51.484 --> 21:53.747
I gotta be up-front.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.792
Becoming a Marine
for your pops

21:55.836 --> 21:58.447
is not a good idea.

22:00.319 --> 22:04.366

to make their parents proud.

Yeah, but it's not the same.

'cause you're the one that's got
to live it. You feel me?

22:36.703 --> 22:38.661
The doctor confirmed
it was a bullet.

22:38.705 --> 22:40.402
Paul was shot 12 years ago.

22:40.446 --> 22:42.448
Bullet must have
migrated over time,

22:42.491 --> 22:44.841
eroded into the lung
and punctured it.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.452
So far, we haven't been unable
to find any trace

22:46.495 --> 22:47.931
of where Paul might have gone
after the clinic.

22:47.975 --> 22:49.933
Is there anything else
you remember?

22:49.977 --> 22:52.936
Something that could
indicate where he might go?

22:52.980 --> 22:55.112

of trouble breathing.

same time Paul was shot.

That same year, a shopkeeper
was killed during a robbery.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.819
Left behind a wife
and a young daughter.

23:49.863 --> 23:52.126
Case went cold because
there wasn't enough evidence.

23:52.169 --> 23:54.476
You think Tanner killed
the shopkeeper?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.478
No. But our prime suspect

23:56.522 --> 23:59.350
was Paul and Tanner's father,
Henry Wilson.

24:01.744 --> 24:03.572
Okay, so the father
commits the murder,

24:03.616 --> 24:05.008

24:07.184 --> 24:08.708
You think Tanner shot Paul?

24:08.751 --> 24:10.927
That's the theory
we're working with.

24:10.971 --> 24:12.712
Yeah, think about it, right?
They go to the hospital,

24:12.755 --> 24:14.148

find that bullet...

24:14.191 --> 24:16.367

the ballistics to the gun

24:16.411 --> 24:17.499

24:17.543 --> 24:19.327

wasn't protecting his kids,

24:22.112 --> 24:24.593
he was protecting himself.
