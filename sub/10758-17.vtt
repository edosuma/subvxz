00:16.698 --> 00:19.075
You know, Niles,
I think I'm going to have a dinner party.

00:19.242 --> 00:20.327
You care to co-host?

00:20.535 --> 00:22.329
What a lovely idea.
What's the occasion?

00:22.537 --> 00:23.955
Actually, I got the idea last night

00:24.122 --> 00:27.167
when we bumped into Gene
and Hollis Ashby at the symphony.

00:27.334 --> 00:28.835
I want to get to know them better.

00:29.002 --> 00:30.629
Me too.
They're such a charming couple.

00:30.795 --> 00:33.340
They remind me of Maris and me
when we were happy.

00:35.175 --> 00:38.720
Really? I must have been sick
that day.

00:41.431 --> 00:44.058
- Oh, well, Roz.
- Thank you.

00:44.225 --> 00:46.311
- Is that your dry cleaning?
- No, it's Daphne's.

00:46.478 --> 00:49.814
Alice spit up on her dress
so I had to have it dry-cleaned for her.

00:49.981 --> 00:52.483
I also had to buy her
a new pair of shoes and detail her car.

00:52.650 --> 00:54.903
I've never seen a kid so sick.

00:55.069 --> 00:56.446
Hey, Roz. You look gorgeous.

00:56.613 --> 00:58.156
Thanks. How much time do we have?

00:58.323 --> 01:00.825
- Twenty minutes. I better get changed.
- Where are you going?

01:00.992 --> 01:02.744
Daphne has friends
at the British Consulate.

01:02.910 --> 01:05.245
They're having a big reception
and she got us invitations.

01:05.413 --> 01:09.500
Who knows? Maybe you'll meet some
English lord who'll make you a lady.

01:09.959 --> 01:13.463
I think at this point it would take
the actual Lord to make her a lady.

01:14.005 --> 01:18.593
Well, let's pick a date for our party.
You've got your book?

01:19.385 --> 01:21.095
Let's see.

01:21.971 --> 01:25.641
- The first is no good.
- No, wine club.

01:25.808 --> 01:28.144
- Nor the second.
- Library fund-raiser.

01:28.311 --> 01:30.313
- The third, no.
- Fourth, fifth or sixth?

01:30.479 --> 01:32.773
No, no, no, no.

01:32.982 --> 01:34.609
No, no, no.

01:34.775 --> 01:37.069
- Oh, what about the 11th?
- No, concert tickets.

01:37.278 --> 01:40.615
- Oh, really? I don't have that marked.
- Yes, I'm taking a date.

01:41.699 --> 01:43.409
Well, isn't that nice? The 11th,

01:43.576 --> 01:46.370
"Expect desperate, last-minute call

01:46.579 --> 01:50.750
from F."

01:52.001 --> 01:55.921
- Anything the next week?
- No. No.

01:56.088 --> 01:58.924
- I've got the 19th.
- I've got the 19th.

01:59.133 --> 02:01.385
- The 19th it is then.
- Huzzah!

02:04.096 --> 02:05.890
- Hey, boys. What's up?
- Hey, Dad.

02:06.098 --> 02:09.101
Well, actually, after an unusually
protracted game of duelling date books,

02:09.268 --> 02:11.520
Niles and I have set upon
a mutually acceptable evening

02:11.687 --> 02:13.689
for an intime soiree.

02:15.608 --> 02:16.775
We're having a dinner party.

02:16.984 --> 02:19.528
Oh, sounds good.
Any night but the 19th.

02:20.738 --> 02:22.656
Well, what's wrong with the 19th?

02:22.865 --> 02:24.241
My poker game's here that night.

02:24.450 --> 02:25.701
- Can't you reschedule it?
- No.

02:25.868 --> 02:28.954
It's always the third Saturday
of the month, and everybody shows.

02:29.121 --> 02:31.623
You know, Jimmy once postponed
his daughter's wedding

02:31.790 --> 02:33.125
just so that he could be here.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.378
And if you ever saw his daughter,
you'd know how risky that was.

02:37.337 --> 02:39.548
Gee, Dad, you know,
we wouldn't ask

02:39.715 --> 02:41.758
if there were any other date
that worked.

02:41.967 --> 02:43.844
Do you really expect me
to just give up my game

02:44.011 --> 02:46.430
just so that you can have
one of your intime soirees?

02:46.638 --> 02:48.974
I knew he knew what that meant.

02:49.266 --> 02:51.435
Dad, please, couldn't you at least
make a few calls?

02:51.602 --> 02:52.644
Look, I'll tell you what.

02:52.853 --> 02:55.397
If you can change the day,
I'll cover your losses that night.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.818
Well, all right, I'll try. But, you know,
these guys lead pretty busy lives.

02:59.985 --> 03:01.653
I can't always get in touch
with them.

03:01.862 --> 03:05.032
Yes, let's hope that dog track
has a PA system.

03:05.240 --> 03:06.742
All right, Niles, back to our party.

03:06.908 --> 03:09.161
Now, have you got any thoughts
on a caterer?

03:09.369 --> 03:13.373
Well, Cornell Evans.
I mean, he's pricey, but he's the best.

03:13.582 --> 03:15.417
- Oh, let's book him.
- Oh, marvellous!

03:15.584 --> 03:18.003
Oh, I'm sorry, Dad,
I didn't know you were on the line.

03:18.211 --> 03:19.880
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

03:20.046 --> 03:22.674
Well, we're off to the ball.
Don't wait up for us.

03:22.883 --> 03:24.301
Oh, Daphne, wait, wait, wait.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.761
There's something on the back
of your dress.

03:26.928 --> 03:29.472
Oh, my God!
It looks like bleach or something.

03:29.806 --> 03:31.349
The dry cleaner must have done it.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.977
- I saw it. It's nothing.
- You saw it?

03:34.185 --> 03:36.938
- Don't worry. It's hardly noticeable.
- Dr. Crane noticed it.

03:37.147 --> 03:39.524
- Because he's always looking at your...
- Roz.

03:41.234 --> 03:43.570
- Well, I can't go now.
- Why not?

03:43.737 --> 03:45.739
This is the only formal dress I've got.

03:45.905 --> 03:48.074
Wait. I've got the rest
of my dry cleaning in the car.

03:48.241 --> 03:50.577
I bet I have something you can wear.
I'll be right back.

03:50.785 --> 03:55.081
You know, Daphne, I bet
I would be able to get that out for you.

03:55.248 --> 03:57.709
No, the cleaner spoiled it.
He can damn well fix it.

03:57.876 --> 04:00.378
- Well, it would probably just take...
- Niles.

04:00.587 --> 04:03.131
Yes, may I speak to Cornell, please?
Yes, of course, I'll hold.

04:03.298 --> 04:05.800
I mean it. If I just had a toothbrush
and a jeweller's loupe...

04:05.967 --> 04:07.260
Niles!

04:11.514 --> 04:13.766
How long is he gonna keep me
on hold?

04:14.142 --> 04:17.394
Oh, hey, Roz,
did you find any kind of thing that...?

04:17.603 --> 04:19.397
Can't talk right now.

04:20.481 --> 04:22.442
Hello, Cornell?
Yes, Frasier Crane here.

04:22.608 --> 04:25.862
Listen, I'm hoping
that you're not booked on the 19th.

04:26.028 --> 04:27.822
Oh, Lord.

04:27.989 --> 04:29.574
Yes, of course, I understand.

04:29.782 --> 04:33.119
Yeah, same to you.
All right. Bye-bye.

04:33.286 --> 04:34.704
Damn. Wouldn't you know it?

04:34.871 --> 04:37.915
The only date he's got free is the 11th.
Damn those concert tickets.

04:38.124 --> 04:41.252
Oh, you know who might be available?
Tyler Wilkins.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.338
- Doesn't he work with Cornell?
- Oh, dear God, no. Mortal enemies.

04:44.505 --> 04:47.341
They were catering a seafood banquet
when Cornell flew into a rage

04:47.508 --> 04:50.428
because Tyler had ordered mahi-mahi
instead of ahi.

04:51.804 --> 04:53.806
Of course,
Tyler blamed it on Cornell's stutter,

04:53.973 --> 04:55.641
and they haven't spoken since.

04:58.185 --> 04:59.353
Tyler? Niles Crane.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.273
Yes, I was wondering
if you were available on the 19th.

05:02.440 --> 05:06.068
Wonderful. Dinner for ten.

05:06.235 --> 05:08.737
That's great. I'll call you later on,
we'll discuss the menu.

05:08.904 --> 05:09.989
Thanks. Bye-bye.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.158
That is wonderful. All right.

05:12.366 --> 05:17.830
We've got you, me,
and the fabulous Ashbys.

05:17.997 --> 05:20.165
That leaves six chairs to fill.

05:20.374 --> 05:22.543
We have to have the Berkins.
That's a no-brainer.

05:22.710 --> 05:25.629
Technically, that's two no-brainers.
Forget the Berkins.

05:25.796 --> 05:27.131
- Who else?
- Well, wait a minute.

05:27.298 --> 05:29.675
You can't just steamroll over me.
I want the Berkins.

05:29.842 --> 05:31.885
- Well, I don't.
- Well, I do.

05:32.302 --> 05:34.179
All right, all right.

05:34.346 --> 05:38.809
We'll each have the right to blackball,
let's say, three guests.

05:38.976 --> 05:40.561
That way we'll each get an equal voice.

05:40.727 --> 05:43.063
- That's fair enough.
- All right. There's three for you.

05:43.230 --> 05:44.857
And three for me.

05:45.023 --> 05:50.362
And just to get the blackball rolling.
Bye-bye, Berkins.

05:50.737 --> 05:52.573
All right. What about John
and Carol Peterson?

05:52.739 --> 05:57.077
- Everyone loves them.
- Not everyone. Blackball!

05:58.078 --> 05:59.621
- Why?
- No, no, no.

05:59.788 --> 06:02.416
We never question the blackball.
We just bow to its will.

06:03.875 --> 06:06.211
Fine. Nina and Arch Duncan.

06:06.420 --> 06:09.798
The drunken Duncans?
Have you lost your...?

06:10.507 --> 06:11.925
Wait a minute.

06:13.593 --> 06:15.929
You loathe the Duncans.
You want me to waste a blackball.

06:16.138 --> 06:19.474
- That's insane. I adore the Duncans.
- Really?

06:19.933 --> 06:22.853
Well, then perhaps
I've misjudged them.

06:23.019 --> 06:25.313
Very well, Niles. The Duncans it is.

06:26.523 --> 06:29.025
- Nina and Arch...
- Oh, stop it. They're hideous.

06:29.192 --> 06:30.735
Blackball.

06:34.614 --> 06:37.033
- What about the Wolperts?
- Oh, I like the Wolperts.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.785
Finally. Oh, the Gordons?

06:38.994 --> 06:40.787
I love the Gordons.
Now we're rolling.

06:40.996 --> 06:44.374
- How about the DeFalcos?
- Blackball. She is a twit.

06:44.541 --> 06:47.669
- How about the Whitneys?
- Oh, blackball. He's a dolt.

06:48.002 --> 06:49.671
- Cromwells?
- Blackball.

06:49.838 --> 06:51.756
Look, if you're going to...

06:54.717 --> 06:57.137
Wait a minute.
You're out of blackball...

06:57.303 --> 06:59.681
This is a dried-up old fig.

07:00.140 --> 07:02.183
So is Missy Cromwell.
I don't want her at my party.

07:02.350 --> 07:04.352
I'm sorry. Rules are rules.
The Cromwells are in.

07:04.519 --> 07:07.105
The guest list is complete.
Now, let's start calling everyone.

07:07.272 --> 07:10.858
Yes, beginning with
our guests of honour, the Ashbys.

07:11.067 --> 07:13.361
- Oh, yes.
- All right, here.

07:14.362 --> 07:16.698
Hello, Hollis. Frasier Crane calling.

07:16.864 --> 07:21.119
Listen, Niles and I are planning
on having a dinner party on the 19th...

07:22.161 --> 07:23.871
They're leaving for Africa
on the 19th.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.456
Oh, gee, that's a shame.

07:25.623 --> 07:27.834
We were sort of building the evening
around you.

07:29.377 --> 07:30.461
They've got the 11th free.

07:30.670 --> 07:33.631
- No good. We've got that concert.
- I didn't ask you to that.

07:34.882 --> 07:36.551
The 11th should be just fine.

07:36.759 --> 07:38.261
Oh, no, no, they've got a conflict.

07:39.053 --> 07:41.848
Oh, well, that's no problem.
They were our very next call.

07:42.056 --> 07:45.768
We absolutely adore the Duncans.
All right, see you then.

07:45.977 --> 07:47.019
Not the drunken Duncans.

07:47.186 --> 07:50.439
Sorry, they have plans with the Ashbys
on the 11th so they're invited too.

07:50.648 --> 07:52.066
Fine. I want my blackball back.

07:52.275 --> 07:55.569
- The blackball, once dropped, can't...
- Oh, shut up.

07:57.279 --> 07:58.614
Anyway, the Ashbys are worth it.

07:58.781 --> 08:00.783
You know what?
And there's an additional plus.

08:00.950 --> 08:03.786
Since we're changing our plans
for the 11th, Cornell can cater.

08:03.953 --> 08:05.079
Quick. You call Cornell.

08:05.246 --> 08:07.164
I'll call Tyler
and tell him we're cancelling.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.460
Tyler? It's Niles Crane again.
Yes, listen,

08:11.627 --> 08:14.088
it turns out we're not gonna need you
on the 19th after all.

08:14.296 --> 08:16.966
- Yes, Cornell, please.
- No, we're not going to someone else.

08:17.132 --> 08:19.260
Cornell? What gave you that idea?

08:19.426 --> 08:21.512
Cornell, please. Frasier Crane again.
Thank you.

08:21.679 --> 08:23.764
Listen,
we've changed our party plans,

08:23.931 --> 08:26.475
and it turns out
that we'd rather have it on the 11th.

08:26.684 --> 08:30.729
We're cancelling the party entirely.
No, no, there's no reason to be upset...

08:35.818 --> 08:37.068
Which is which?

08:38.278 --> 08:40.614
This one's mine. This one's mine.
I can smell my cologne.

08:41.532 --> 08:43.866
- Hello, Cornell.
- Tyler, of course, you're who we want.

08:44.076 --> 08:46.995
Yes, as I was saying,
we were just about to change the...

08:49.623 --> 08:51.542
- Hello, Tyler...
- Cornell.

08:51.708 --> 08:54.294
- You're gonna laugh when you hear...
- It's the funniest thing...

08:54.461 --> 08:56.338
- Hello?
- Hello?

08:58.173 --> 08:59.841
Well, thanks
to your keen sense of smell,

09:00.008 --> 09:01.885
we've lost both caterers.

09:02.094 --> 09:03.887
I suppose
we can always get Kiki Price.

09:04.096 --> 09:07.140
- Is she still in business?
- Yeah, they dropped the charges.

09:07.516 --> 09:09.601
I'll call her after I get in touch
with the Duncans.

09:09.768 --> 09:12.312
My God, I hope I can catch them
before happy hour.

09:15.357 --> 09:17.526
Hello, Nina? Too late.

09:18.777 --> 09:19.861
It's Frasier Crane calling.

09:20.028 --> 09:23.073
Niles and I are having the Ashbys over
and a few other people for a dinner,

09:23.240 --> 09:26.409
and we were hoping
that you could join us on the 11th.

09:26.618 --> 09:28.370
Don't cry, Nina, please.

09:28.954 --> 09:31.206
Yeah, well,
I've always loved you too.

09:32.249 --> 09:34.584
What? Joaquim?

09:34.751 --> 09:36.169
Joaquim is coming in
from Argentina.

09:36.336 --> 09:39.047
- You'd like him to join us. Well...
- Joaquim?

09:39.256 --> 09:42.008
Joaquim Juarez. He's the conductor
of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic.

09:42.175 --> 09:44.261
Right, they were down there.
They must have met him.

09:44.427 --> 09:46.888
We would love
to have Joaquim join us.

09:47.097 --> 09:48.348
Oh, that's splendid.

09:48.556 --> 09:51.518
All right, then we'll just see you
on the 11th. The 11th.

09:52.769 --> 09:54.854
Take two swizzle sticks,
stand them up side-by-side.

09:55.021 --> 09:56.689
Eleven. That's right. Bye-bye.

09:56.898 --> 10:00.485
- We've got Joaquim!
- Well, don't cry for me, Arch and Nina.

10:02.445 --> 10:05.490
All right, let's see.
We've got the Duncans and Joaquim.

10:05.657 --> 10:08.409
And that means we're going to have
to cut out two couples.

10:08.576 --> 10:11.246
All right, well, the Cromwells and...

10:11.412 --> 10:12.789
- The Gordons.
- The Gordons.

10:12.956 --> 10:15.708
All right, that leaves us short by one.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.585
We're going to need a single female.

10:18.127 --> 10:19.504
Oh, Roz, perfect timing.

10:19.671 --> 10:21.547
- What's up?
- We're having a dinner party.

10:21.756 --> 10:23.800
We need an interesting
single woman.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.677
Do you know anybody?
We're desperate.

10:27.428 --> 10:28.888
Excuse me?

10:29.097 --> 10:32.850
Naturally, we thought of you first, Roz,
but this isn't really your kind of crowd.

10:33.059 --> 10:35.269
What, sophisticated? Cultured?

10:35.436 --> 10:38.272
Is that why you think I won't fit in
with your snooty A-list friends?

10:38.439 --> 10:40.274
- I'm not genteel enough?
- Oh, now, Roz...

10:40.441 --> 10:41.609
Now, Roz, my ass.

10:41.776 --> 10:45.446
I'm just as refined as you are.
Shut up, Niles.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.658
Roz, please.

10:48.824 --> 10:52.620
Well, I hope you're satisfied.
I got everyone to change.

10:52.787 --> 10:54.747
We're gonna have it on the 11th.

10:56.958 --> 10:59.502
- The 11th?
- Yeah, and it wasn't easy either.

10:59.669 --> 11:02.922
Mel had to reschedule
his polyp surgery.

11:03.881 --> 11:06.509
Well, Dad,
you are really gonna laugh at this.

11:06.676 --> 11:09.428
Frasier and I rescheduled
our dinner party for the 11th.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.138
I'm not changing it back. I'm not.

11:11.305 --> 11:15.184
And, Dad, I would never even consider
asking you to do such a thing.

11:15.351 --> 11:18.229
Tell you what, there's no reason
why we can't hold both parties

11:18.395 --> 11:19.438
simultaneously.

11:19.605 --> 11:21.148
The apartment
is certainly big enough.

11:21.816 --> 11:24.568
I know what you're trying to do,
and it won't work.

11:24.777 --> 11:29.365
What, Dad? I'm serious.
No, no, we can share the buffet table.

11:29.573 --> 11:33.118
We can even have the harpist learn
Bobby Darin tunes for your crowd.

11:33.494 --> 11:34.787
I can stand it if you can.

11:34.954 --> 11:37.164
Of course, we will have
to dim the lights at one point.

11:37.331 --> 11:39.083
You see,
Nina Duncan always insists

11:39.249 --> 11:41.502
on sharing her extensive collection
of slides

11:41.669 --> 11:43.337
from the summer
she danced "Agamemnon"

11:43.504 --> 11:45.714
at Jacob's Pillow.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.804
All right! I'll change it.

11:54.389 --> 11:55.474
Call Kiki and the Wolperts.

11:55.641 --> 11:57.184
- I'll talk to Roz.
- I'm on it.

11:57.392 --> 11:59.353
Come on, just pick something.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.730
Pick what?
This one isn't dressy enough.

12:01.897 --> 12:03.565
This one doesn't fit, and this one...

12:03.732 --> 12:06.985
Well, it's hardly appropriate
for a posh cocktail reception.

12:07.569 --> 12:10.447
Excuse me. Roz, listen,
I just came to apologise.

12:10.614 --> 12:12.532
- Whatever.
- What happened?

12:12.741 --> 12:15.118
He said I wasn't classy enough
to come to his dinner party.

12:15.285 --> 12:17.663
- Roz, you know I didn't mean that.
- Oh, get in line.

12:17.871 --> 12:20.457
I've lived here for six years.
Only time I'm asked to that table

12:20.624 --> 12:22.667
is when I'm holding
a freaking serving spoon.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.838
It's just a silly dinner party.
What's everybody getting upset about?

12:27.047 --> 12:30.592
Oh, let's just go. I suppose this colour
might look nice on me after all.

12:30.759 --> 12:33.094
Excuse me. I left messages for Kiki
and the Wolperts.

12:33.261 --> 12:35.847
Could you two please leave
so Daphne can change?

12:36.056 --> 12:37.891
Daphne, you're not going out
in that, are you?

12:38.058 --> 12:39.976
That's it. I'm staying home.

12:40.185 --> 12:43.188
No, just try it. We can accessorise it.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.232
With what?
A lamppost and a public defender?

12:50.987 --> 12:53.406
Good Lord,
was that the answering machine?

12:54.366 --> 12:58.411
<i>Hi, it's Allison Wolpert and yes,
count us in for the 11th.</i>

12:58.578 --> 13:00.497
<i>Looking forward to it. Bye.</i>

13:00.663 --> 13:02.582
That's wonderful.
I so enjoy the Wolperts.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.042
<i>- Yes.
- Who was that?</i>

13:04.375 --> 13:07.712
<i>We just got invited to a dinner party
at Dr. Crane's.</i>

13:07.879 --> 13:10.173
<i>- Which Dr. Crane?
- Does it matter?</i>

13:10.340 --> 13:12.217
<i>You get the one,
you get that other one.</i>

13:13.009 --> 13:16.137
<i>Personally, I think
the whole arrangement is a little...</i>

13:16.304 --> 13:20.433
<i>- Is that thing off the hook?
- What? Oh, my God.</i>

13:30.360 --> 13:32.654
What do you suppose
she meant by that?

13:33.363 --> 13:37.283
Obviously, she thinks
we're always together,

13:37.742 --> 13:41.287
that we're some sort of couple.

13:43.122 --> 13:47.043
That's ridiculous.
We spend lots of time apart.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.713
Besides, who is she to talk?
Look at her and Harry.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.716
- They go everywhere together.
- They're married, Niles.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.138
Still, it's no reason for her
to call us odd.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.515
Well, wait.
She never called us odd. Listen.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.772
<i>Does it matter? You get the one,
you get that other one.</i>

14:07.938 --> 14:11.150
<i>Personally, I think
the whole arrangement is a little...</i>

14:11.317 --> 14:13.152
<i>- Is that thing off the hook?
- See?</i>

14:13.361 --> 14:16.155
She never said odd.
We're getting upset over nothing.

14:16.363 --> 14:17.782
Nothing?

14:17.948 --> 14:20.576
Is there a good end
to that sentence?

14:21.494 --> 14:24.872
"Personally, I think the whole
arrangement is a little" what?

14:25.164 --> 14:26.957
Charming?

14:27.750 --> 14:30.169
Now, you really... Stop overreacting.

14:30.544 --> 14:32.796
Well, perhaps she has a point.
Ever since your divorce,

14:32.963 --> 14:34.840
you've become more
and more attached to me.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.759
Maybe that's why she said
what she said.

14:37.468 --> 14:41.096
- What?
- You get Frasier, you get that Niles.

14:41.597 --> 14:42.765
She didn't say that.

14:42.931 --> 14:45.017
She said, "You get the one,
you get that other one."

14:45.184 --> 14:47.519
What makes you think you're the one
and I'm the other one?

14:47.728 --> 14:50.898
Because I am the one giving the party,
and you are that other one!

14:51.106 --> 14:53.817
I'm the one that invited her,
so that makes you that other one.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.402
- That's ridiculous!
- It's not!

14:55.569 --> 14:58.071
- Absolutely no foundation of truth...!
- No, I knew...!

14:58.238 --> 15:01.158
All right, wait, wait. This is absurd.
Why don't we just call Allison up,

15:01.325 --> 15:03.202
ask her what she thinks
is so strange about us?

15:03.368 --> 15:04.703
We can both get on an extension.

15:04.870 --> 15:06.997
Better yet, we both get on a bicycle
built for two,

15:07.164 --> 15:10.334
ride over there ourselves, and ask her
what's so strange about us?

15:15.130 --> 15:16.757
Hello?

15:16.965 --> 15:18.842
Yes, hello, Nina.

15:19.635 --> 15:21.053
Right. What can I do for you?

15:21.386 --> 15:23.722
No, no, dear, you called me.

15:25.349 --> 15:27.976
Oh, yes,
Joaquim can only eat certain foods.

15:28.143 --> 15:30.145
Yes, of course,
we'll be glad to accommodate him.

15:30.312 --> 15:31.730
How exotic.

15:32.689 --> 15:33.774
Let's see. All right.

15:34.441 --> 15:37.527
Rice. Beans.

15:38.320 --> 15:39.613
Jerked beef.

15:42.699 --> 15:44.868
Any particular reason?

15:45.035 --> 15:46.786
I see.

15:48.121 --> 15:52.375
Interesting. Okay. Bye.

15:53.168 --> 15:56.129
Why is Joaquim
on such a strict diet?

15:57.589 --> 16:00.550
Because the Joaquim
they're bringing to dinner...

16:01.343 --> 16:03.845
...is their foster child...

16:09.934 --> 16:12.979
...from a tiny village on the Pampas.

16:13.938 --> 16:15.315
He speaks no English,

16:15.482 --> 16:18.651
and he gets nauseated
when he eats American food.

16:21.571 --> 16:24.365
So he's not the conductor
of the Buenos Aires Philharmonic?

16:24.574 --> 16:26.576
Oh, you are so that other one!

16:27.827 --> 16:28.870
All right, fine.

16:29.078 --> 16:31.623
Where are we gonna find someone
to babysit a 9-year-old child?

16:31.789 --> 16:36.127
Quit your blubbering
and just pick something, damn it!

16:36.836 --> 16:37.879
Roz?

16:38.046 --> 16:39.255
- Now what?
- You were right.

16:39.422 --> 16:41.966
You know, you would be
a welcome addition to any party.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.634
Oh, you don't have to say that.

16:43.843 --> 16:47.472
No, no, no, honestly, Niles and I
want you to join us for dinner.

16:47.847 --> 16:48.890
- You mean it?
- Yes.

16:49.056 --> 16:52.810
We're having someone who might
make a dinner companion for you.

16:53.019 --> 16:55.146
He's not some stuffy old coot, is he?

16:55.354 --> 16:57.565
- No, no. Young.
- No. Yes, very young.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.735
Okay, thanks.

17:01.068 --> 17:03.946
- All right, we've got our ten.
- All right, let's see.

17:04.113 --> 17:06.991
Not exactly my wish list,
but at least we've got the Ashbys.

17:07.157 --> 17:09.535
Yes, and Allison Wolpert
can say what she wants.

17:09.702 --> 17:11.537
Why should we care
what anybody else thinks?

17:11.704 --> 17:12.829
- Am I right?
- Absolutely.

17:12.997 --> 17:15.458
Dad, do you think we're odd?

17:16.125 --> 17:20.128
No, you're not odd.
You're just special.

17:22.757 --> 17:24.592
Your mother told me that
when you were kids,

17:24.759 --> 17:26.469
and I still believe it.

17:27.344 --> 17:30.764
Yes, but do you think
we spend too much time together?

17:31.265 --> 17:32.600
What kind of questions are these?

17:32.766 --> 17:35.186
You're close.
Lots of brothers are close.

17:35.394 --> 17:37.104
Yes, I suppose
you're right about that.

17:37.271 --> 17:39.857
Yes, I mean, the Gershwins,
the Wright Brothers.

17:40.024 --> 17:41.775
I told you we're getting upset
over nothing.

17:41.942 --> 17:43.986
Then there were
the Collyer brothers.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.780
- The Collyer brothers?
- Oh, yeah, a couple of nutsos,

17:46.947 --> 17:49.199
shared an apartment in New York
their whole lives.

17:49.408 --> 17:52.036
They even built a maze
out of newspapers in there

17:52.202 --> 17:54.038
that only they knew
how to get through.

17:54.246 --> 17:55.831
Then it collapsed on one of them,

17:56.040 --> 17:58.167
and the other one just sat there
with the dead body

17:58.333 --> 18:01.044
until the neighbours complained
about the smell.

18:01.462 --> 18:03.464
Pretty crazy story, huh?

18:05.841 --> 18:08.635
You recycle, right, Niles?

18:11.138 --> 18:12.514
You know,

18:12.723 --> 18:16.476
maybe it wouldn't be the worst idea
if we went our own ways a bit more.

18:16.643 --> 18:21.732
Well, it's possible we have grown
a tad dependent on one another.

18:22.441 --> 18:24.693
Perhaps this is just the warning
we need.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.862
Today, we're planning a dinner party.

18:27.029 --> 18:28.905
Tomorrow,
we're wearing matching pyjamas

18:29.072 --> 18:31.366
and washing each other's hair.

18:33.243 --> 18:35.954
Let's face it, Niles,
we are one stone's throw away

18:36.121 --> 18:38.540
from becoming
the neighbourhood kooks,

18:38.749 --> 18:42.252
right down to the local children
ringing our doorbell and running away.

18:42.461 --> 18:45.297
Now, Frasier, you are letting
your imagination get the better of you.

18:45.464 --> 18:49.259
Come on,
let's go make a seating chart.

18:49.426 --> 18:51.928
You always know
how to cheer me up.

18:53.179 --> 18:55.348
- Oh, hello, Daphne.
- Daphne...

18:55.515 --> 18:56.600
Isn't that Roz's dress?

18:56.808 --> 18:59.185
Yes, it was really the only thing
that looked good on me.

18:59.352 --> 19:01.104
Come on, Roz,
we don't want to be late.

19:04.983 --> 19:06.526
Doesn't she look beautiful?

19:06.735 --> 19:09.237
Oh, shove it, Daphne.
I know you think I look like a hooker.

19:09.404 --> 19:12.991
No! No, Roz, I said
it made me look like a hooker.

19:13.158 --> 19:16.161
On you, it... Well, it works.

19:20.123 --> 19:21.791
Hello?

19:22.167 --> 19:23.918
Yes, yes.

19:24.085 --> 19:28.298
Oh, Lord, well, I'm so sorry
you can't make it.

19:28.464 --> 19:32.594
No, no, that's all right.
Yes, some other time. Goodbye.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.512
Oh, please, not the Ashbys.

19:35.805 --> 19:37.890
Family emergency.

19:38.766 --> 19:40.685
Apparently, so urgent
they didn't even have time

19:40.852 --> 19:43.021
to think up a plausible excuse.

19:43.646 --> 19:47.650
- So where does that leave us?
- Well, let's see.

19:49.485 --> 19:52.613
We have a third-rate caterer
with a record,

19:52.905 --> 19:54.323
two lushes,

19:54.490 --> 19:58.077
a couple
who think we're both nutcases,

19:58.286 --> 20:01.664
an Argentine wild child and Roz.

20:02.707 --> 20:05.960
Dinner is served.

20:07.587 --> 20:09.005
I still have one blackball left.

20:09.213 --> 20:10.756
I don't think
it'll make any difference.

20:10.923 --> 20:12.466
It will to me. I'm using it on myself.

20:12.633 --> 20:13.801
- No.
- Blackball!

20:14.010 --> 20:16.012
No, no, you cannot self-blackball.

20:16.178 --> 20:18.681
You're gonna go to that party
or you'll go over my dead body.

20:18.848 --> 20:19.974
You just give me that now!

20:24.020 --> 20:28.357
God, we are the Collyer brothers.

20:31.902 --> 20:36.407
You know,
why don't we just face the inevitable?

20:36.574 --> 20:39.368
Let's just cancel
the whole damn thing.

20:39.535 --> 20:42.079
Of course, cancelling a party
20 minutes later,

20:42.246 --> 20:44.415
people will think it's strange.

20:44.582 --> 20:46.333
Frankly, I'm sick and tired
of giving a damn

20:46.500 --> 20:47.918
about what other people think.

20:48.085 --> 20:51.547
Most of them are one marble away
from not being here in the first place.

20:52.172 --> 20:53.424
You're right.

20:53.590 --> 20:56.677
So we spend a lot of time together.
So what?

20:56.844 --> 20:58.178
I enjoy it.

20:58.971 --> 21:01.181
So do I, Niles.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.934
You know, we can make
those calls tomorrow and cancel.

21:04.101 --> 21:05.269
I'm famished.

21:05.477 --> 21:08.647
Why don't we just head over
to Campagne for dinner? My treat.

21:08.814 --> 21:09.940
You're on.

21:10.149 --> 21:12.818
Unless you think it's too odd
to have dinner together.

21:14.611 --> 21:16.280
I don't think
we're in any danger of that.

21:16.446 --> 21:17.948
If our relationship became truly odd,

21:18.115 --> 21:21.451
