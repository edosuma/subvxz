00:27.242 --> 00:29.202
Oh, oh, he's got one.

00:29.878 --> 00:31.178
False alarm.

00:31.179 --> 00:32.659
I really thought
that was gonna be it.

00:33.415 --> 00:34.849
Wait, wait...

00:38.353 --> 00:39.352
Huh?

00:39.354 --> 00:41.289
(groans)

00:41.290 --> 00:43.290
You know, like, "Say cheese."

00:43.291 --> 00:45.526
It comes with cheese.

00:45.527 --> 00:47.261
Yeah, it's really good.

00:47.262 --> 00:48.262
No, it's not.

00:48.263 --> 00:49.897
It's just a cheeseburger.

00:49.898 --> 00:51.298
Cheese on a burger?

00:51.299 --> 00:53.134
You broke it wide open, Dad.

00:53.135 --> 00:55.136
Well, it's better
than the "Let Us Catch Up Burger."

00:55.137 --> 00:56.604
With lettuce and ketchup.

00:56.605 --> 00:57.805
So you're in a little slump.

00:57.806 --> 00:59.407
You know what you should do?

00:59.408 --> 01:01.242
Take a walk to the store
and look at some produce.

01:01.243 --> 01:02.443
Maybe you'll get inspired.

01:02.444 --> 01:03.878
Yeah, maybe I should.

01:03.879 --> 01:05.279
And if that doesn't work,

01:05.280 --> 01:06.580
just take peyote,
like in the old days.

01:06.581 --> 01:07.581
Right.
(bell jingles)

01:07.582 --> 01:08.983
Maybe something pickled.

01:08.984 --> 01:10.418
Pickled something...

01:10.419 --> 01:11.819
Ugh, what is wrong with me...

01:11.820 --> 01:13.387
(grunts) Ow!

01:13.388 --> 01:14.588
MAN: Are you okay?

01:14.589 --> 01:15.990
No. Ow.

01:15.991 --> 01:17.391
Oh, I went down pretty hard.

01:17.392 --> 01:18.492
Oh, uh, Bob?

01:18.493 --> 01:20.795
Jairo? Oh, come on.

01:20.796 --> 01:23.130
I thought I recognized
those whimpers of pain.

01:23.131 --> 01:25.967
(groans) God, why is
this sidewalk so slippery?

01:25.968 --> 01:28.402
Oh, it is excess sandalwood oil

01:28.403 --> 01:29.937
I use it for massage.

01:29.938 --> 01:31.939
So you dumped oil
onto the sidewalk?

01:31.940 --> 01:33.341
You make that sound bad.

01:33.342 --> 01:34.775
People will fall, Jairo.

01:34.776 --> 01:36.177
I just fell.
You did.

01:36.178 --> 01:37.611
You fell down, go boom.

01:37.612 --> 01:39.447
(groans) Ugh, I think
my shoulder is broken.

01:39.448 --> 01:40.848
It's not broken.

01:40.849 --> 01:42.283
If it was broken,
you would know it.

01:42.284 --> 01:43.484
Oh, don't say that.

01:43.485 --> 01:44.852
That's just
something people say.

01:44.853 --> 01:46.120
I'll see what a doctor says.

01:46.121 --> 01:47.455
It's not broken.

01:47.456 --> 01:48.789
If it was broken, you'd know it.

01:48.790 --> 01:50.625
It's a torn labrum.

01:50.626 --> 01:52.626
Oh, my God, a torn labrum!
What's a labrum?

01:52.627 --> 01:55.029
It's the middle part of your wiener.
No!

01:55.030 --> 01:57.465
Close. The labrum is
cartilage in our shoulders

01:57.466 --> 01:59.800
that helps us do movements
like this and this.

01:59.801 --> 02:02.103
All right!
(chuckling): All right.

02:02.104 --> 02:03.938
Well, I don't do
a lot of high-fiving,

02:03.939 --> 02:05.606
but I'm worried I'm not
gonna be able to cook.

02:05.607 --> 02:08.008
Oh, you should.
I should what?

02:08.009 --> 02:09.009
You should high-five.

02:09.011 --> 02:10.544
Okay.

02:10.544 --> 02:12.446
So when will I be able
to do that... and cook?

02:12.447 --> 02:14.048
Right after the rehab

02:14.049 --> 02:15.483
that's right after
the surgery that you need.

02:15.484 --> 02:16.550
Wait, I need surgery?!

02:16.551 --> 02:17.551
(chuckling): Yeah.

02:17.552 --> 02:18.552
Sandra!

02:18.553 --> 02:19.553
Sandra!

02:19.554 --> 02:20.788
Sandra!

02:20.789 --> 02:22.189
Sandra! Gene. Sandra!

02:22.190 --> 02:23.557
This is fun.
It is fun.

02:23.558 --> 02:25.359
Sandra!

02:25.360 --> 02:27.461
Sandra! Louise. Sandra?

02:27.462 --> 02:28.462
(chuckling): Where is she?

02:28.463 --> 02:30.798
Sandra!
Sandra!

02:30.799 --> 02:31.799
Were you guys calling me?

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Hey, look, it's Sandra.

02:32.801 --> 02:34.201
So I checked your insurance,

02:34.202 --> 02:36.570
and your deductible is high.
How high?

02:36.571 --> 02:38.572
Really high, $6,000 high.

02:38.573 --> 02:40.474
Ouch. I mean, totally worth it.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.843
But you slipped in oil, right?
Yeah.

02:42.844 --> 02:44.912
And someone poured it there?
Right.

02:44.913 --> 02:46.180
Just sue the guy.

02:46.181 --> 02:47.581
I like Sandra.

02:47.582 --> 02:49.583
Sandra!
(laughs)

02:49.584 --> 02:51.018
I don't know.

02:51.019 --> 02:52.219
I don't want to sue anyone.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.654
You know what they say...

02:53.655 --> 02:55.489
"If you don't sue,
shame on you."

02:55.490 --> 02:57.325
I don't think people say that.

02:57.326 --> 02:59.727
If you don't sue, shame on you.

02:59.728 --> 03:01.562
Oh, so people do say that.

03:01.563 --> 03:03.564
Listen, your case
is very strong.

03:03.565 --> 03:06.000
I'm sure we can sue Jairo
for damages, lost wages,

03:06.001 --> 03:08.269
pain and suffering...
the deluxe package.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.905
I say we ask for 300,000,
settle for two.

03:10.906 --> 03:12.607
$200,000?

03:12.608 --> 03:14.442
Jairo doesn't have
that kind of money.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.277
He's mystical and handsome,
but he's not rich.

03:16.278 --> 03:17.712
He's rich in abs.

03:17.713 --> 03:20.081
N-No, we only need, like, 6,000.

03:20.082 --> 03:22.516
I see. I'm thinking
maybe my hourly rate

03:22.517 --> 03:24.518
would better suit this suit.

03:24.519 --> 03:26.087
(chuckles) Get it?

03:26.088 --> 03:27.521
(chuckles) This guy.

03:27.522 --> 03:28.756
I like it.

03:28.757 --> 03:29.757
Um, uh, that could work.

03:29.758 --> 03:31.192
All right, what I can do for you

03:31.193 --> 03:33.194
is encourage Jairo to pay
for your surgery

03:33.195 --> 03:35.796
with a strongly worded letter
on my letterhead.

03:35.797 --> 03:37.231
Interesting.

03:37.232 --> 03:38.733
Just sending
a letter could work?

03:38.734 --> 03:40.568
Well, you'd be surprised
how many doors

03:40.569 --> 03:42.570
a letter from a lawyer can open.

03:42.571 --> 03:43.971
Or close.

03:43.972 --> 03:45.806
It seems like you're
talking slower,

03:45.807 --> 03:47.742
since you started
charging by the hour.

03:47.743 --> 03:50.745
(slowly):
No, this is the speed I talk.

03:50.746 --> 03:53.114
But that reminds me
of a funny story.

03:53.115 --> 03:54.582
Oh, I want to hear
a funny story.

03:54.583 --> 03:56.417
(chuckling):
Once when I was in law school...

03:56.418 --> 03:58.552
(laughs) No, no, no,
let's not tell stories.

03:58.553 --> 03:59.754
We should go.
We're off the clock.

03:59.755 --> 04:01.155
Thank you. Bye.
Bye.

04:02.591 --> 04:04.425
"It Takes Bun To Know Bun."

04:04.426 --> 04:06.260
Served on a fancy bun. Huh.

04:06.261 --> 04:07.461
I don't want to talk about it.

04:07.462 --> 04:09.297
Me neither.

04:09.298 --> 04:12.133
Bob, this letter says
I am liable for your labrum.

04:12.134 --> 04:14.335
I am liable for no one's labrum.

04:14.336 --> 04:16.603
Look, I really didn't want
to get a lawyer involved,

04:16.605 --> 04:18.339
but unless you pay
for my surgery,

04:18.339 --> 04:19.940
we're gonna have to sue you.

04:19.942 --> 04:21.475
Hello, Jairo.

04:21.476 --> 04:23.477
I see you're looking tan
and perfect, as usual.

04:23.478 --> 04:25.479
Good for you.
Thank you, Tina.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.582
So, Bob, who said
you need surgery?

04:27.583 --> 04:28.583
My doctor.

04:28.584 --> 04:29.984
A doctor? (scoffs)

04:29.985 --> 04:31.619
What does that sound mean?

04:31.620 --> 04:33.454
(repeats scoff) You don't
know what that means?

04:33.455 --> 04:36.457
It's, um... I think I do, it's
just that you're doing it weird.

04:36.458 --> 04:38.593
I am not doing it weird
at all. You do it.

04:38.594 --> 04:41.128
(scoffs) That's I'm doing.
(scoffs)

04:41.129 --> 04:42.697
(chuckles)
That's not... (scoffs)

04:42.698 --> 04:45.166
(scoffs) Well,
I think you're both nailing it.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.168
Hmm, you look like
you are in pain.

04:47.169 --> 04:49.003
(grunts) I am in pain.

04:49.004 --> 04:51.005
Because I fell
on your oily sidewalk,

04:51.006 --> 04:54.442
and I can't chop onions
or flip burgers or make a fist.

04:54.443 --> 04:55.843
Perhaps I can help.

04:55.844 --> 04:57.278
(inhales deeply) Um...

04:57.279 --> 04:59.880
(Jairo grunts)
Please stop touching me.

04:59.881 --> 05:01.816
Now try to make a fist.

05:01.817 --> 05:03.351
You made a fist.

05:03.352 --> 05:04.352
I... I did.

05:04.353 --> 05:05.353
How'd you do that?

05:05.354 --> 05:07.455
I am a healer.

05:07.456 --> 05:09.857
Bob, let me work with you
instead of you getting

05:09.858 --> 05:13.461
this painful super-yucky surgery
you so-call say you need.

05:13.462 --> 05:15.162
You really think
you can heal Bob?

05:15.163 --> 05:16.564
How about this?

05:16.565 --> 05:18.566
If I can't heal you
in ten sessions,

05:18.567 --> 05:20.234
I'll pay for your surgery.

05:20.235 --> 05:21.469
(sighs) Fine.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.304
Ah, the healing has begun.

05:23.305 --> 05:24.305
(groans)

05:24.306 --> 05:25.706
Let me in on that.

05:25.707 --> 05:27.141
Okay.
I want some of that.

05:27.142 --> 05:28.976
Okay. (chanting): Heal our dad.

05:28.977 --> 05:31.748
Heal his disgusting broken body!

05:33.074 --> 05:36.126
Is everyone liking
the font? Yes? Good.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.195
We have just created
the very real-sounding law firm

05:38.196 --> 05:40.330
of Fromage, Schuster
and Pitz-Lopez.

05:40.331 --> 05:43.333
We sure we don't want to go with
Daddy, Grandpa and the Beaver?

05:43.334 --> 05:45.168
Pretty sure. So what's
our first suit?

05:45.169 --> 05:48.171
I think a letter from
our attorneys might get Miss Selbo

05:48.172 --> 05:50.607
to back off
with all those tardy slips.

05:50.608 --> 05:52.009
Yeah, tardiness happens.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.011
Deal with it, Selbo!

05:54.012 --> 05:56.179
There's the patient. I made you
a big breakfast for your healing

05:56.180 --> 05:57.648
I'm not supposed to eat.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.116
Jairo said to arrive
with an empty stomach,

05:59.117 --> 06:01.485
an open mind and no underwear.

06:01.486 --> 06:02.886
Dibs on Dad's underwear.

06:02.887 --> 06:04.721
I'm wearing underwear.
Oh, boo.

06:04.722 --> 06:06.156
And I'm eating this.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.991
But your mind's open,
right, honey?

06:07.992 --> 06:09.693
Mmm, not really. Bye.

06:09.694 --> 06:12.729
JAIRO: <i>Okay, Bob,
let's explore your lifestyle.</i>

06:12.730 --> 06:15.165
Describe the color
and personality

06:15.166 --> 06:17.401
of your bowel movements.
Mm, no.

06:17.402 --> 06:18.835
Just give me some key words.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.371
Are they perky, shy, clingy?

06:21.372 --> 06:22.873
You know what,
this was a mistake.

06:22.874 --> 06:23.874
I-I should just get the surgery.

06:23.875 --> 06:25.842
JAIRO (jabbering):
Ajabuttabuta...

06:25.843 --> 06:27.311
(Bob groaning)

06:27.312 --> 06:29.146
Ah, how do you do that?

06:29.147 --> 06:32.149
Take off the sling crutch,
and take off your clothes,

06:32.150 --> 06:33.984
starting with the underwear.

06:33.985 --> 06:35.586
It's time for a massage.

06:35.587 --> 06:37.688
Wait, h-how'd you know
I was wearing underwear?

06:37.689 --> 06:38.922
You have underwear face.

06:38.923 --> 06:40.757
(bell ringing) TINA: <i> So, yeah.</i>

06:40.758 --> 06:42.593
Unless you want to get hit
with a lawsuit,

06:42.594 --> 06:44.227
you'll be taking
these tardy slips back.

06:44.228 --> 06:45.662
'Kay? Sorry.

06:45.663 --> 06:47.264
We're late because we care!

06:47.265 --> 06:50.033
Do you know how long it takes
to put this together?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.035
Let's go to work
on your shoulder.

06:52.036 --> 06:54.037
(groans) That's not my shoulder.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.441
Before we walked upright,
our buttocks were our shoulders.

06:57.442 --> 06:58.675
And I found a knot.

06:58.676 --> 07:01.211
Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.213
You're holding stress
everywhere I touch.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.615
There is a knot.
(Bob groans)

07:04.616 --> 07:06.216
Oh, a double-knot.
Do you feel that?

07:06.217 --> 07:08.685
Yes, pressing on knots
hurts a lot. Ow!

07:08.686 --> 07:10.954
Hmm, I wouldn't know.
I've never had one.

07:10.955 --> 07:13.390
To heal you,
we must heal the stress.

07:13.391 --> 07:15.792
So what is causing
all your stress?

07:15.793 --> 07:17.527
I-I don't know.

07:17.528 --> 07:19.029
I guess, um, uh, money?

07:19.030 --> 07:21.431
Money? What a silly thing
to stress about.

07:21.432 --> 07:23.133
You silly money goose.

07:23.134 --> 07:25.569
(groans) Okay, so, wait,
you don't worry about money?

07:25.570 --> 07:27.137
Don't you pay rent here?

07:27.138 --> 07:29.573
I teach capoeira to make things
other than money,

07:29.574 --> 07:33.443
such as fit bodies
and healthy non-clingy bowels.

07:33.444 --> 07:36.446
Speaking of which,
our first session is over.

07:36.447 --> 07:37.881
Here, you have earned this.

The yellow scrunchy of trust.

07:41.052 --> 07:42.052
And here's this.

07:42.053 --> 07:43.053
What's this for?

07:43.054 --> 07:44.121
You are dripping with oil.

07:44.122 --> 07:45.122

Whoa. Oop.
Hup! Hey-oh!

07:48.793 --> 07:50.794
Help.
Heh-dup, hup-hup!

07:50.795 --> 07:53.430
(door bell jingles) So how
was your first day of healing?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.432
You know, actually, my shoulder
feels a little better.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.267
That's great. What you got
on your wrist there?

07:57.268 --> 07:58.569
Oh, this? I-I...
I don't know.

07:58.570 --> 07:59.836
I guess I earned it.

07:59.837 --> 08:01.772
Is that a scrunchy?
Um, uh, yeah.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.941
Give it to me.
I'll put it in my hair. Okay, uh...

08:03.942 --> 08:05.642
Well, no, you know what,
I'm gonna keep it.

08:05.643 --> 08:07.644
So, Bob, burger of the day, huh?

08:07.645 --> 08:10.647
Oh, the "Head, Shoulders,
Knees, and Tomatoes" burger.

08:10.648 --> 08:12.649
Is it okay?
It's fine.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.484
I mean, it's a burger
with tomatoes on it.

08:14.485 --> 08:15.919
Well, that, yeah, that's
what I was going for.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.921
Right. Well, you did it.

08:17.922 --> 08:19.923
You're gonna come out

Is anything coming?

Put a burger on that board!

14:40.919 --> 14:42.720
(bell tinkles)

14:42.721 --> 14:45.990
Uh, why is Teddy walking in
the street trying to punch cars?

14:46.024 --> 14:48.326
He's overreacting because I... TINA:
The burger of the day board is blank!

14:48.360 --> 14:49.961
The burger of the day board
is blank!

14:49.962 --> 14:51.329
Ahh!

14:51.363 --> 14:52.897
Your father's
not doing it today.

14:52.898 --> 14:54.265
Or maybe ever again.

14:54.299 --> 14:55.867
According to Jairo,

14:55.868 --> 14:57.902
they were "stressing him out."
But it's blank!

14:57.903 --> 14:59.771
You kids can write something
up there if you want.

14:59.772 --> 15:01.739
You know, one of
your joke burgers or something.

15:01.774 --> 15:03.908
What?! It's no fun
if you want us to!

15:03.942 --> 15:06.043
All right, do it or don't do it.

15:06.044 --> 15:07.445
It's fine either way.

15:07.446 --> 15:09.080
Does anyone want
a broccoli smoothie?

15:09.081 --> 15:10.314
No! I hate you!

15:10.315 --> 15:11.783
Maybe a sip!

15:11.784 --> 15:13.918
That's it,
we gotta get rid of Jairo.

15:13.919 --> 15:17.422
Time for Fromage, Schuster,
and Pitz-Lopez to take over.

15:17.423 --> 15:18.823
(bell tinkles)

15:18.824 --> 15:20.491
Did you put this phony

15:20.492 --> 15:22.126
cease-and-desist letter
under Jairo's door?

15:22.127 --> 15:23.361
Give it to me!

15:23.395 --> 15:24.829
Give it to me! Phony?

15:24.830 --> 15:26.097
That looks real to me.

15:26.098 --> 15:27.298
Look at that font.

15:27.332 --> 15:28.966
Roman numerals.
Must be real.

15:29.001 --> 15:30.468
Bob, if you wanted me to leave,

15:30.469 --> 15:31.769
you could've just told me.

15:31.770 --> 15:33.004
You didn't have to threaten me

15:33.005 --> 15:35.039
with "death by scrunchy."

15:35.073 --> 15:37.809
Kids, did you do this?
We're not at liberty to discuss...

15:37.843 --> 15:39.911
Louise...
Fine! We wrote that letter.

15:39.912 --> 15:41.312
But you left us no choice!

15:41.313 --> 15:43.381
You've changed, man.
You've changed.

15:43.415 --> 15:45.383
My client isn't going anywhere.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.285
Your client?
You're our lawyer.

15:47.286 --> 15:50.021
In the case of <i> Bob v. Jairo,</i>
I'm Bob's lawyer.

15:50.022 --> 15:52.623
But in <i> Jairo v. Bob,</i>
I'm Jairo's lawyer.

15:52.658 --> 15:53.825
How is that legal?

15:53.859 --> 15:55.493
They're totally different cases.

15:55.494 --> 15:56.961
But what's not legal

15:56.962 --> 15:58.663
is the eviction of
a good-looking tenant

15:58.664 --> 16:01.666
who has a verbal contract
to stay here for free.

16:01.700 --> 16:03.901
Did you just say
"good-looking tenant"?

16:03.936 --> 16:05.903
That's the law.
This guy's amazing.

16:05.938 --> 16:07.238
Tom, I love your energy.

16:07.272 --> 16:08.473
I love <i> your</i> energy.

16:08.474 --> 16:09.630
You're my favorite client.

16:09.641 --> 16:11.321
Uh, thanks.

16:13.420 --> 16:15.125
Kids, you can't go around
threatening people

16:15.126 --> 16:16.706
with letters from fake lawyers.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.308
We can and we have.

16:18.309 --> 16:20.376
And it was fun and it worked!
Until it didn't.

16:20.411 --> 16:22.512
Well, now we're stuck
with friggin' Jairo.

16:22.513 --> 16:23.980
Listen, having Jairo
in our basement

16:24.014 --> 16:25.348
is a good thing.

16:25.349 --> 16:26.916
He's helped me in a lot of ways.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.284
He's not just a shoulder shaman.

16:28.319 --> 16:29.686
Why am I listening to you?

16:29.687 --> 16:31.154
Is it because you're crouching?

16:31.155 --> 16:32.989
Yeah, since when have
you been able to crouch?

16:33.023 --> 16:34.023
Only recently.

16:34.024 --> 16:35.158
You've changed, man.

16:35.192 --> 16:36.459
And you don't miss

16:36.460 --> 16:37.927
making burgers of the day?
At all?

16:37.928 --> 16:39.162
I do not...

16:39.163 --> 16:40.430
miss it... at all.

16:40.431 --> 16:42.365
I'm totally... content.

16:42.366 --> 16:43.800
Yup, yeah, yeah.
Fine.

16:43.801 --> 16:45.201
Come on, emergency kids-only

16:45.202 --> 16:46.970
under the table meeting, now!

16:47.004 --> 16:49.706
All right, trying to evict
Jairo sort of backfired.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.207
So what we need to do now

16:51.208 --> 16:53.610
is get Jairo un-evicted
from his old place.

16:53.611 --> 16:55.011
How are we gonna do that?

16:55.012 --> 16:56.679
By taking our case to the top.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.214
(gasps) Beyoncé?

16:58.215 --> 16:59.449
Close.

16:59.483 --> 17:02.352
Now make me look like a lion.

17:02.353 --> 17:04.921
Mr. Fischoeder,
you've been served.

17:04.954 --> 17:08.157
Okay, it'll be ready
in ten minutes, bye!

17:08.159 --> 17:09.526
To-go order, Bobby!

17:09.560 --> 17:12.194
"Four burgers of the day." Lin?

17:12.229 --> 17:13.997
Yeah.
We don't serve those anymore.

17:13.998 --> 17:15.498
Oh, right.

17:15.499 --> 17:16.900
Well, uh, they're
coming in ten minutes,

17:16.901 --> 17:18.300
so cook 'em something.

17:18.335 --> 17:20.203
Okay, let's see here now...

17:20.204 --> 17:22.806
"...pursuant to <i>Orville vs. Redenbacher..."</i>
Mm-hmm.

17:22.807 --> 17:24.339
Blah, blah, blah...

17:24.340 --> 17:26.608
"habeas porpoise," blah,
blah, blah... Mm-hmm.

17:26.644 --> 17:28.978
"Reverse-evict Jairo."

17:29.013 --> 17:30.013
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

17:30.014 --> 17:31.314
Hmm... (sniffs)

17:31.315 --> 17:33.349
Blueberry-scented marker.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.452
Mm-hmm. Yeah, blueberry.
We pay extra for that.

17:35.486 --> 17:39.022
Well, I smell a fake lawyer
in the mix here.

17:39.056 --> 17:40.924
What? What?!
How dare you!

17:40.925 --> 17:42.559
You got us.
Tina!

17:42.560 --> 17:45.161
Yes. I use fake lawyers myself
from time to time.

17:45.162 --> 17:48.698
I once stopped these
very wharf workers from unionizing

17:48.699 --> 17:50.266
with a rather playful letter

17:50.267 --> 17:52.202
on a very threatening
letterhead.

17:52.236 --> 17:54.270
Interesting.
I bet you wouldn't want them

17:54.271 --> 17:55.672
to find that out, would you?

17:55.706 --> 17:58.041
Oh, why did I say
that to someone

17:58.042 --> 17:59.642
who wants something from me?

17:59.677 --> 18:01.311
I thought we were cool.

18:01.345 --> 18:02.645
BOB: <i>I'm not doing it.</i>

18:02.680 --> 18:04.247
I'm not cooking
a burger of the day.

18:04.248 --> 18:05.648
All right, fine, whatever.

18:05.683 --> 18:07.617
I'm just making regular burgers.

18:07.618 --> 18:09.686
Regular, stress-free burgers.
Uh-huh.

18:09.687 --> 18:11.254
You know what?
I'll see what's in the fridge

18:11.288 --> 18:12.889
and I'll just slap something on.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.157
But I am not gonna name it.

18:14.191 --> 18:16.593
Great, now I'm stressed.

18:16.594 --> 18:18.027
And I'm running out of time.

18:18.028 --> 18:19.696
And there's thyme.

18:19.697 --> 18:21.731
Huh, egg.

18:21.732 --> 18:22.732
Lin!
What...?

18:22.733 --> 18:23.867
Linda!
What?

18:23.868 --> 18:25.101
Runny out of thyme!
What?

18:25.102 --> 18:26.936
Runny fried egg and thyme!

18:26.971 --> 18:30.340
The "Runny Out Of Thyme Burger!"
Oh. Oh!

18:30.374 --> 18:32.342
It's the best one
I've come up with in weeks!

18:32.376 --> 18:33.510
Oh, he's back!

18:33.544 --> 18:35.211
I'm back, baby!

18:35.212 --> 18:37.247
Ha-ha, whoo!

18:37.248 --> 18:39.249
Uh, Bob, will you
hold my ponytail

18:39.250 --> 18:41.551
while I do some
upside-down push-ups?

18:41.552 --> 18:42.786
Hold on a minute.

18:42.787 --> 18:44.554
What's going on with this?

18:44.555 --> 18:46.322
Oh, I came up with
a burger of the day

18:46.323 --> 18:47.590
that I'm really proud of.

18:47.591 --> 18:48.825
I'm confused.

18:48.826 --> 18:50.093
You gave them up.

18:50.094 --> 18:51.494
Because they are stress makers.

18:51.495 --> 18:53.430
Well, they're also happy makers.

18:53.431 --> 18:55.765
Hey, we should call them
"happy meals." Oh, wait...

18:55.766 --> 18:57.734
You were finally at peace,

18:57.735 --> 19:00.070
like a pigeon who found
a jar of peanut butter.

19:00.104 --> 19:02.405
Jairo, you know I love
your pigeon analogies,

19:02.406 --> 19:04.607
but I think I need
to wake up every day

19:04.608 --> 19:07.177
and wrestle with this,
and create something.

19:07.178 --> 19:09.579
And that can be stressful,
but it's worth it.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.915
There's my Bob.
There's my stressful Bob.

19:11.949 --> 19:15.485
Your body will turn back
into a knotted, rotted thing.

19:15.486 --> 19:17.253
It will creak like a boat.

19:17.288 --> 19:18.655
I like his creaking.

19:18.656 --> 19:20.290
I know where he is in the dark.

19:20.324 --> 19:22.292
Then I must go.
What?

19:22.293 --> 19:24.527
You can still stay here
until you find another place.

19:24.528 --> 19:27.430
No. Your... your stress will
make it all stressy in here.

19:27.431 --> 19:28.631
Where you gonna go?

19:28.666 --> 19:30.500
I don't... know.

19:30.501 --> 19:32.602
Maybe I need to change
the way I live...

19:32.636 --> 19:34.004
buy a jacket...

19:34.005 --> 19:35.472
Hit the bricks, Jairo!

19:35.473 --> 19:37.006
You can move back
into your old place.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.508
Oh, everything's fine!

19:38.509 --> 19:40.176
No changes for Jairo!

19:40.177 --> 19:42.312
Really, Mr. Fischoeder?
You'll take Jairo back?

19:42.346 --> 19:45.315
Well, if it means avoiding
another worker uprising...

19:45.316 --> 19:47.183
which aren't as fun
as they used to be,

19:47.184 --> 19:49.486
now that workers
are considered "people."

19:49.487 --> 19:51.154
Thank you, Mr. Fishsticks.

19:51.155 --> 19:53.289
That'll teach me
to be honest with children.

19:53.290 --> 19:55.191
Good-bye, Belcher family.

19:55.192 --> 19:57.527
And Bob, you earned this.

19:57.528 --> 19:58.862
(gasps) The red one!

19:58.863 --> 20:00.330
Oh, whoops, sorry about that.

20:00.331 --> 20:02.165
I meant to give you
the purple one.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.867
Oh. O-Okay.

20:03.868 --> 20:06.302
The chalkboard! It's not blank!
It's alive again!

20:06.337 --> 20:09.139
A to-go order busted
your father out of his slump.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.407
Yeah, what's taking
them so long?

20:10.408 --> 20:11.808
Their burgers are
gonna get cold.

20:11.809 --> 20:13.043
Um, they're not coming.

20:13.044 --> 20:14.511
What? They're not?

20:14.512 --> 20:16.813
Yeah, no, there wasn't
really a to-go order.

20:16.814 --> 20:18.248
I made it up.
And it worked!

20:18.249 --> 20:19.516
I <i> am</i> your muse!

20:19.517 --> 20:20.750
Ha! Muse-dance!

20:20.751 --> 20:22.319
(grunts dancing noises)

20:22.353 --> 20:24.721
But the burgers are real.
(gobbling)

20:24.722 --> 20:26.589
Huh. It's kind of weird
not having Jairo around.

20:26.590 --> 20:27.824
(door bell tinkles)

20:27.858 --> 20:29.092
Jairo's back.

20:29.093 --> 20:30.360
Totally forgot, I'm supposed

20:30.361 --> 20:31.594
to teach a class right now.

20:31.595 --> 20:33.963
Would it be cool if we...

20:33.998 --> 20:35.398
Go ahead.
Use the basement.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.367
Thank you, Bob, you're the best.

20:37.368 --> 20:38.835
TEDDY: There's something
on the board.

20:38.836 --> 20:40.704
There's something on the board!

20:40.738 --> 20:42.772
Bobby, make me one of those!

20:42.773 --> 20:44.274
But hold the egg.
That sounds gross.

20:44.275 --> 20:45.675
And the thyme.

20:45.676 --> 20:46.910
Do you know what?
Just do the tomato one!

20:46.911 --> 20:48.411
I'm coming in!
