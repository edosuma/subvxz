WEBVTT

00:12.880 --> 00:16.440
Tonight, the fastest man in the world on our tracks.

00:16.440 --> 00:18.200
They don't call him Bolt Of Lightning for nothing.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.600
The slowest man in the world falls asleep.

00:21.600 --> 00:26.160
And we literally set fire to Dorset with a machine gun.

00:31.720 --> 00:35.080
Thank you everybody, thank you.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.040
Thanks very much. Hello.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.720
Hello and welcome.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.040
Now, fast Fords.

00:42.040 --> 00:46.120
What they do is demonstrate that you don't need a plum in your mouth

00:46.120 --> 00:48.760
and a double-barrelled surname to get on in life.

00:48.760 --> 00:52.200
The RS Capri is Harold Wilson.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.760
The Sierra Cosworth is Bruce Springsteen.

00:54.760 --> 01:02.120
And then of course there is the Escort Cosworth, proof that God wears a donkey jacket.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.120
I love a fast Ford. And now there's a new one.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074

01:17.880 --> 01:20.320
It's called the Focus RS.

01:20.320 --> 01:25.200
And let's cut straight to the chase.

01:25.200 --> 01:31.680
It costs 25,000 which is family saloon money.

01:31.680 --> 01:34.400
But its top speed

01:34.400 --> 01:37.880
is 163 miles an hour.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.120
There's a reason for that insane speed.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.360
A Volvo engine.

01:53.360 --> 01:57.240
It's the same one they used in the Focus ST but now it has new pistons,

01:57.240 --> 01:59.840
a new intercooler, a new inlet manifold.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.120
And a new type of turbo.

02:04.720 --> 02:12.160
The result is a front-wheel-drive car that produces 300 horse powers, which is impossible

02:17.520 --> 02:22.800
Asking the front wheels of a car to do the normal job of steering while handling let's say more than

02:22.800 --> 02:29.280
170 brake horse power is like asking a man to wire a plug while juggling...

02:29.280 --> 02:31.040
penguins,

02:31.040 --> 02:34.120
while making love to a beautiful woman

02:34.120 --> 02:38.120
while on fire, on stage, in front of the Queen.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.600
It's all going to go wrong.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.400
To try and make sure it doesn't, the RS has a new type of

02:45.400 --> 02:50.640
front differential featuring things that only James May can understand.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.280
But does it work?

02:53.280 --> 02:56.600
So, watch the steering wheel, OK? Hands off.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.640
Yep, that's torque steer, look.

03:00.640 --> 03:05.560
The power is actually turning the wheel, and violently turning it.

03:05.560 --> 03:09.360
So the diff hasn't fully cured that problem.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.600
But what about cornering?

03:15.720 --> 03:22.040
You can actually feel the whole system working through the wheel. It's odd.

03:26.520 --> 03:30.240
I have to say though the grip is absolutely phenomenal.

03:30.240 --> 03:31.920
Look at that.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.680
Eventually of course you will slide wide. But only after your face has come off.

03:49.360 --> 03:51.440
This is an amazing car.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.560
And let's not forget, shall we, that without behind the noise...

03:57.080 --> 04:04.040
and the power, and the massively flared wheel arches, this is still a Ford Focus.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.320
It has a big boot, a fold-down rear seat.

04:06.320 --> 04:09.800
Sat nav and air conditioning.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.160
You might think this is a bit garish.

04:15.160 --> 04:19.399
The sort of car that would turn up to court with its hat on back to front.

04:19.399 --> 04:22.000
You might think your BMW is better.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.080
But when it comes to offering the maximum amount of fun

04:26.080 --> 04:30.800
with the most amount of practicality for the least amount of money,

04:30.800 --> 04:34.840
I honestly can't think of anything which even gets close.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.960
Oh, I can!

04:44.720 --> 04:48.480
This is a Renault Megane R26R.

04:53.400 --> 04:59.440
It weighs 19 stone less than the standard hot Megane because it has no sound dampening,

04:59.440 --> 05:02.200
no sat nav, no radio,

05:02.200 --> 05:05.040
and even a titanium exhaust system.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.600
And the result of all of that, this car has just been round the Nurburgring 8 minutes 17 seconds.

05:13.600 --> 05:17.040
No other front-wheel drive car has ever been around faster.

05:18.960 --> 05:25.240
So if it's fun you're after, forget Jeremy's fat Ford, this is what you want.

05:30.120 --> 05:32.640
Hammond. Yes, what? Let me ask you a question.

05:32.640 --> 05:37.040
Yes, go on. How many horse powers do have in your Renault?

05:37.040 --> 05:38.760
227.

05:38.760 --> 05:45.560
227. So that's 73 less than I have in the Ford. Shall we count them?

05:45.560 --> 05:50.800
One, two, three... Yes, it's got less horse power because it needs less because it's lighter.

05:50.800 --> 05:54.480
How much does your Ford weigh? 1.4 tons.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.320
About 200 kilos more than this. It's a sports car.

05:57.320 --> 06:00.880
Power, Hammond, is everything. No it isn't, it's lightness.

06:00.880 --> 06:04.880
Power. No, it's not. It is. It isn't. It is.

06:04.880 --> 06:08.480
It isn't. It is. Well, it is a bit. Do you know what?

06:08.480 --> 06:10.320
We should settle this and there's only one way. Yes.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.160
A race. A drag race. Yes.

06:12.160 --> 06:17.240
And I'm thinking not just a conventional drag race, let's make it a Le Mans style drag race.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.640
Come back here. What, where you run to the car? Run to the car.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.480
That car's quite a long way. Run to the car. Belt on, engine on, whoom!

06:23.480 --> 06:25.960
OK? Ready? Aye. Steady.

06:25.960 --> 06:27.840
Yep. Go!

06:27.840 --> 06:31.040
You see, I'm in all ready.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.400
Right, belt on.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.640
I don't have a belt, I have a harness but that's OK.

06:41.280 --> 06:45.240
No, that's... Oh, God, I'm sitting on it.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.680
That's not right.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.040
What do think of that? Let's do...

07:02.040 --> 07:05.040
I won the race, came back to the start line, you haven't even begun.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.920
What's the matter? Four-point harness.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.440
Hammond suggested we had a new race where we started in the cars.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.800
Whoa! Come on!

07:17.800 --> 07:20.760
Oh, he's got a bit of a quick start.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.760
Lightness versus power. Ha, ha, ha.

07:23.760 --> 07:29.280
Not enough in line, the light weight helped there but now the power comes in.

07:29.280 --> 07:30.400
Oh, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha!

07:35.800 --> 07:38.840
I had you up to 120. And then what happened?

07:38.840 --> 07:40.480
How much does that cost anyway?

07:40.480 --> 07:42.280
25,000.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.920
There you go, that's 2,000 more than the Renault.

07:44.920 --> 07:48.280
What's this? Ah, yes, that's to save weight, it's thin.

07:48.280 --> 07:50.840
That's not thin. It's lightweight, that's the point.

07:50.840 --> 07:56.480
Look at this. Yeah? It's to keep the weight down low so that the bits high up the car are light.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.920
It's a polythene bag.

07:57.920 --> 08:03.360
That's to make it... I'd love to know just how much room there is in the back for somebody of my height.

08:03.360 --> 08:09.840
Oh no, it's all full of scaffolding. Yes, and that makes it better through the corners. Better than what?

08:09.840 --> 08:13.720
Better than that thing for a start. Let's have a look in here, shall we?

08:13.720 --> 08:18.280
No radio. You don't want a radio in there, it's about weight. You want to listen to the engine.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.680
Passenger airbag? Who cares about them?

08:20.680 --> 08:23.960
You've got just one airbag. Yes. There's nothing...

08:23.960 --> 08:26.480
Yes, because it's been stripped out.

08:26.480 --> 08:30.760
Let's look at the opposite end of the scale. The winning...  Let's just have a look.

08:30.760 --> 08:35.799
Stereo, yeah, big unit. And what's this big stick down there?

08:35.799 --> 08:37.520
Just push that. Yeah.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.600
Voice control?

08:39.600 --> 08:41.280
Voice control.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.240
Put the radio on please?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.160
No, don't be stupid.

08:46.160 --> 08:49.560
COMPUTER VOICE: Important speech commands for radio are... Oh God!

08:49.560 --> 08:51.720
How does that help you go faster?

08:51.720 --> 08:54.760
Let's just go to the graphic equaliser, shall we?

08:54.760 --> 08:58.240
I don't want any of this on my sports car.

08:58.240 --> 09:00.200
The thing that gets you...

09:00.200 --> 09:02.840
What do you mean? None of this has anything to do up with a hot hatch.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.800
No, the whole point of a hot hatch is that it should do everything.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.080
Yours just does fast, and not very well.

09:09.080 --> 09:12.360
After another hour of bickering, we swapped cars.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.760
And both of us were in for a big surprise.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.480
That's a lot of power.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.800
God, it's quick on the corners.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.320
Then it all turned into a big race.

09:28.200 --> 09:33.720
It looks like I have myself a big green Ford bearing down.

09:33.720 --> 09:36.840
Every time I catch up on the straight...

09:36.840 --> 09:41.280
Yeah, this is better on the braking. And I can turn tighter.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.160
Oh, I'm over steering! Oh no!

09:50.040 --> 09:51.600
Power. Reeling in.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.160
Ha-ha.

09:53.160 --> 09:58.840
Soon the film crew realised it would all end in a big crash and tried to stop us.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.600
Please come back in.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.840
What? Having too much fun.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.920
The crew's going mad for some reason.

10:14.720 --> 10:19.200
What? CREW: Got to do tracking shots. Come on, stop carrying on!

10:19.200 --> 10:21.880
What were you thinking? We've got other shots to do.

10:21.880 --> 10:24.000
It was him. The sun's going down.

10:24.000 --> 10:27.000
I wanted to come in. I actually did say we should go in.

10:31.280 --> 10:35.000
After a whole day's testing we arrived at three conclusions.

10:36.520 --> 10:40.000
One, the Renault is the best to drive on a short blast.

10:40.000 --> 10:45.480
Two, the more powerful more comfortable Ford is better to own on a day-to-day basis.

10:45.480 --> 10:48.040
And three,

10:48.040 --> 10:54.120
if you had your heart set on one of these before the banking crisis came along, don't worry,

10:54.120 --> 10:57.400
because you can now have just as much fun

10:57.400 --> 10:59.640
for a whole lot less.

11:03.720 --> 11:07.480
Fair point. Fair point. Exactly

11:09.080 --> 11:12.360
Craftsmanship. That's good, that's good.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.960
It's a good car.

11:13.960 --> 11:18.840
It is. But obviously as an overall engineering package there is only one choice.

11:18.840 --> 11:22.440
Yes, there is. The Ford.

11:22.440 --> 11:26.200
I completely agree with absolutely nothing you're saying.

11:26.200 --> 11:31.520
Tell you what, we will sort this out by finding out which is the fastest round our track.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.800
That of course means handing them over to our tame racing driver.

11:34.800 --> 11:42.080
Some say that he is absolutely baffled by urinals.

11:42.080 --> 11:48.400
And that on reflection this was a bad week to launch his debut single.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.200
It's a tribute

11:50.200 --> 11:52.240
to Farah Fawcett.

11:52.240 --> 11:55.560
All we know is he's called The Stig.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.280
There we go. Now the Renault is going to be fastest.

11:58.280 --> 12:02.960
Yeah but look, it's straight into the lead. But wait till we get to the first corner.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.840
There we go. It will still be ahead, I knew it. Look at that.

12:05.840 --> 12:09.000
Look at the Renault clinging on like a kitten to your curtains.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.120
Aha, but now what's going to happen? The Focus is still rolling.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.680
Is that music coming from your Renault? No.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.200
No, because it hasn't got a stereo.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.000
No bagpipe music, how is that a bad thing?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.880
Look at it roll. The Ford can't stay on the track.

12:24.880 --> 12:25.880
Watch the Ford.

12:25.880 --> 12:29.600
Scuffing its door mirrors as it goes through. Just shut up. What a mess!

12:29.600 --> 12:31.280
Cornering level from the Renault.

12:31.280 --> 12:34.800
Now it's all straight from here on in. 300 horsepower.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.560
There we go.

12:40.560 --> 12:43.000
The cheese-eating surrender monkey is now going to be...

12:43.000 --> 12:46.120
200 horse power hauling its massive bulk.

12:46.120 --> 12:49.880
Here we go, coming up to the second to last corner.

12:49.880 --> 12:54.800
I admit, yes, the Renault will be good through here.  And the Ford...

12:54.800 --> 12:56.480
That is superb.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.160
Absolutely magnificent last bit. Exciting.

12:59.160 --> 13:03.480
Across the line!

13:07.160 --> 13:11.200
The Ford did it. Ford first.

13:11.200 --> 13:18.040
The Ford did it in 1 minute 29.3 seconds. There it is.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.040
A good time, OK, OK.

13:20.040 --> 13:22.840
But the Renault, what did it do?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.880
Oh God, I've forgotten.

13:24.880 --> 13:28.280
No, come on, tell us. It was on the tip of my tongue, I can't remember.

13:28.280 --> 13:35.120
Can I just say if you're watching this on the Sky Plus, welcome. You haven't missed much.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.400
Just a crummy Renault driving around quite slowly.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.680
Just tell us what the Renault did it in?

13:40.680 --> 13:44.080
1.28.01. 1.28.01!

13:46.480 --> 13:49.080
That's brilliant. A victory for the Renault.

13:49.080 --> 13:52.640
Doesn't matter.

13:52.640 --> 13:56.040
It doesn't matter. It can't go on the board. What, why?

13:56.040 --> 13:59.040
It's on slicks. These are slick tyres. They're road legal.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.160
There's no tread on them at all.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.800
They're road legal. They're morally wrong. What?

14:03.800 --> 14:05.840
Morally wrong?

14:05.840 --> 14:09.160
So, you're going to report me to the Church in England now?

14:09.160 --> 14:11.520
Yes, and then you'd be in trouble with the baby Jesus.

14:11.520 --> 14:13.640
For my tyre treads?

14:13.640 --> 14:18.680
And now the news and we begin the news with a new Lamborghini.

14:18.680 --> 14:26.160
Here it is. And that has been named after the recently retired chief test driver Valentino Balboni.

14:26.160 --> 14:30.400
I bet they wouldn't have called it after him if he'd been named Ken Shufflebottom.

14:30.400 --> 14:34.400
Their new chief test driver is called Max Venturi. No, he's not.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.280
He is. He is, honestly. That's his real name.

14:37.280 --> 14:42.600
Nobody outside of a comic strip is called Max Venturi, Lamborghini tester.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.680
You don't need a driving licence to be a Lamborghini test driver.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.520
You just turn up for the interview, go, "I'm sorry,

14:49.520 --> 14:52.640
I'm drunk and mad but I'm called Velociraptor Clint Thrust."

14:52.640 --> 14:54.800
"Right, you start on Monday."

14:54.800 --> 14:58.240
It's a limited edition. They're only don't make 250.

14:58.240 --> 15:02.360
It's 138,000 which is 10,000 less than the regular car.

15:02.360 --> 15:06.080
But that's because this is rear wheel drive. The others are four wheel drives.

15:06.080 --> 15:10.120
But what I really like about it is that stripe. This one? Yeah.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.080
It goes over the seats as well.

15:12.080 --> 15:15.240
Does it? Yes, it carries over the roof and over the seats.

15:15.240 --> 15:19.360
I like that stripe so much I'd be prepared to buy the whole car just to get it.

15:19.360 --> 15:25.360
Can I just offer one word of warning to anyone who's thinking of buying Gallardo? James, for you.

15:25.360 --> 15:27.560
Have you seen this?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.800
That's a burning Gallardo.

15:29.800 --> 15:31.560
Have you seen this?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.120
That a burning Gallardo.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.440
Have you seen this? That a burning Gallardo.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.320
I know, but have you seen this? That's a burning Gallardo!

15:38.320 --> 15:39.120
What about this?

15:39.120 --> 15:41.320
Burning Gallardo. What about this?

15:41.320 --> 15:44.080
That would be a burning Gallardo. That's ridiculous.

15:44.080 --> 15:48.360
So I go into the dealer and I say, "I'd like a Lamborghini, could I have one that's not on fire?"

15:48.360 --> 15:54.040
The thing is, I have to say, this is what makes driving a Lamborghini so exciting.

15:54.040 --> 15:57.720
You drive a normal car and it's not on fire.

15:57.720 --> 16:01.640
Hey, now listen, Goodwood Festival of Speed last weekend as I am sure you know.

16:01.640 --> 16:05.360
This is a celebration of all the great cars or the brilliant cars we have seen over the years.

16:05.360 --> 16:10.080
Renault turned up with this.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.240
I kid you not. Look what it says here on the picture they sent us.

16:13.240 --> 16:19.640
The Renault ZE, that stands for zero emissions, Renault ZE concept wows Goodwood Festival of Speed.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.520
Wrong word, should be "ruins".

16:21.520 --> 16:23.440
What are they talking about?

16:23.440 --> 16:27.080
How many children said, "Dad, can we please go to Goodwood Festival

16:27.080 --> 16:30.240
of Speed cos I really want to see a zero emission Renault van?"

16:30.240 --> 16:34.520
Yes, how many of those kids went back to school the next day, "Did you see the chrome-plated Bugatti?"

16:34.520 --> 16:37.880
"No, but I saw a Renault van with green windows, yeah."

16:37.880 --> 16:39.880
Right, what else have we got?

16:39.880 --> 16:43.560
Right, now Hammond, have you seen this?

16:43.560 --> 16:46.560
It's for you. Oh, it's a Zonda.

16:46.560 --> 16:50.120
This thing, this is Zonda Cinque.

16:50.120 --> 16:53.160
It's got a new front splitter, new diffuser.

16:53.160 --> 16:58.280
But what they've done is invent a new composite fibre

16:58.280 --> 16:59.920
to make this thing.

16:59.920 --> 17:05.520
The body of it is made, it combines carbon and titanium to make carbotanium.

17:05.520 --> 17:11.440
It's straight out of a comic. And it's made of carbotanium.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.160
Carbotanium. It's a good job they didn't call it titbon!

17:14.160 --> 17:17.079
Anyway, that's got quite a lot of power.

17:17.079 --> 17:21.960
678, 217 miles an hour, 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds.

17:21.960 --> 17:23.880
It's right up your street, Hammond.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.640
Do you know the most impressive statistic about this car?

17:26.640 --> 17:34.720
It does 124 miles an hour to zero in 4.3 seconds.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.200
Just in case, let me just time that for you.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.560
So you're doing 124 now.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.440
Brake, 100, 50 and you've stopped now. That's immense.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.400
124 to... It's just unbelievable.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.720
You would feel that. That could actually quite literally make you sick, decelerating at that rate.

17:51.720 --> 17:56.120
In fact, I did a calculation. That is the equivalent of minus 1.3G.

17:56.120 --> 17:59.400
Your sick would come out really quickly.

17:59.400 --> 18:03.920
All over the dash of your Zonda... Bits of carrot.

18:03.920 --> 18:09.320
And you did a calculation on how quick the sick would come out?  Oddly enough, I have

18:09.320 --> 18:14.840
Your sick, Richard Hammond, if you braked from 125 miles an hour to 0 in that Zonda

18:14.840 --> 18:20.000
would accelerate out of your mouth at 12.9 metres per second squared.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.080
James! Nobody's bothered. Now, anyone here been to China?

18:24.080 --> 18:30.240
OK, the thing is, when you're there you are often tempted to buy one of those fake watches.

18:30.240 --> 18:31.920
Yes, because you just think, oh yes,

18:31.920 --> 18:35.120
that'll get everybody fooled. Oh, it's stopped.

18:35.120 --> 18:39.200
The thing is there's a Chinese company now called Geely

18:39.200 --> 18:44.560
and they have launched a fake Rolls-Royce. Oh, give over.

18:44.560 --> 18:48.000
Got a picture of it here.

18:48.000 --> 18:54.920
If there is ever any budget cut on The Apprentice, Alan Sugar could turn up in that,

18:54.920 --> 18:57.400
nobody would be any the wiser. It's identical!

18:59.920 --> 19:03.520
It's almost like they said, what does a Rolls-Royce look like, down the phone.

19:03.520 --> 19:08.480
Mind you, you think the overall shape is bad, you know the Flying Lady on the front.

19:08.480 --> 19:12.240
We've got the picture here of the one that is actually on Alan Sugar's car. There it is.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.400
Would you like to see the one on the Geely fake?

19:15.400 --> 19:16.600
Yep. Here it is.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.320
Oh God!

19:18.320 --> 19:22.880
They just made that out of a bit of foil and the top of a cigarette packet and twisted it into shape.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.480
It's got no head. It's terrible.

19:24.480 --> 19:28.080
Anyway, listen, that is the news. And now we must move on.

19:28.080 --> 19:35.240
One of the questions we are forever being asked is, which is fastest, a car or a letter?

19:35.240 --> 19:38.600
Yeah, it's a very interesting question, so we decided

19:38.600 --> 19:41.880
we would race against Her Majesty's postal service.

19:41.880 --> 19:46.200
Job number one, find ourselves a first class set of wheels.

19:51.560 --> 19:54.320
And this could very well do the job.

19:54.320 --> 19:58.560
Porsche's first ever four-door saloon.

19:58.560 --> 20:02.640
It's called the Panamera and it ought to be good

20:02.640 --> 20:07.560
since it's taken them 61 years to get around to making it.

20:10.560 --> 20:14.200
You said in our last series that this looks like an Austin Maxi.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.480
Yes, I did. I'm not so sure now.

20:17.480 --> 20:20.680
Anyway, more of the car in a minute. First though, our race.

20:22.400 --> 20:25.480
We are currently down here in the Scilly Isles

20:25.480 --> 20:29.040
which is the most south-westerly part of Britain.

20:29.040 --> 20:35.040
And the finishing point is all the way up here in the middle of the very remote Orkneys.

20:35.040 --> 20:39.080
Yes, and in a moment that man is going to pop that letter in the letter box.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.080
Shortly after that, Postman Pat will pick it up.

20:41.080 --> 20:45.920
And then it will be on its way to Zanzibar Bungalow, Birsay, Orkney.

20:45.920 --> 20:49.600
Right, so basically it is our job to defend the honour of the car

20:49.600 --> 20:53.640
against the might of the Royal Mail and everything at its disposal.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.120
So we must get their first because, if we don't,

20:56.120 --> 20:59.680
we are effectively saying, don't buy this Porsche, buy a stamp.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.480
Yeah, I'm inclined get a wriggle on. Go.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.520
I took the wheel for the first leg.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.560
Load it up. Excuse me. Thank you.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.120
You're driving the next leg.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.920
You've only driven it 200 yards.

21:24.680 --> 21:27.400
As we hit the open sea,

21:27.400 --> 21:30.720
our rival swung into action.

21:33.320 --> 21:36.640
The letter would travel by helicopter to the mainland

21:36.640 --> 21:40.440
and then onwards via four plane journeys to the Orkneys.

21:40.440 --> 21:43.880
Passing through several sorting offices along the way.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.800
Delivery time was before noon the next day.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.520
That must be the helicopter with the letter on it.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.200
Well, we've lost! But I haven't driven the car yet.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.280
In fact by the time we landed in Penzance,

22:01.280 --> 22:05.360
the letter had all ready been on the mainland for an hour and a half

22:05.360 --> 22:07.880
and was now at the sorting office in Truro.

22:07.880 --> 22:13.280
Next stop for us, the ferry at John O'Groats in Scotland.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.120
830 miles, Go, go, go.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.760
Let's see what its overtaking ability is like.

22:27.880 --> 22:32.720
Significant. It goes like a stabbed rat.

22:32.720 --> 22:41.240
This particular stabbed rat is the cheapest version with a 4.4 litre 394 horse power V8.

22:41.240 --> 22:44.760
Top speed 176 miles per hour.

22:44.760 --> 22:49.000
Price, just over 72,000.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.880
And I know it's got some extras.

22:50.880 --> 22:52.400
Yeah, this one has everything.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.880
It's got leather interior, 3,000.

22:55.880 --> 22:58.200
Wheels, 930 quid.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.680
What, you don't get wheels normally?

23:00.680 --> 23:02.840
Doppelkupplungsgetriebe DPG.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.800
That's the gearbox, yeah.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.840
2,289 quid to you.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.800
Sun roof, 946 quid.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.600
Heated multi-function steering wheel, 700 quid.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.480
And to finish off, ceramic brakes,

23:15.480 --> 23:19.040
5,235 quid.

23:20.720 --> 23:25.040
I've just discovered something so brilliant that you are going to get excited.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.920
There are five dials on the dash.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.440
Yeah. Look at that. Sat nav.

23:29.440 --> 23:33.600
You get the moving map in the dial. Oh, oh!

23:33.600 --> 23:36.520
You're not going to crash doing this? Yes, I am!

23:37.640 --> 23:41.080
It does 0 to 60 in 5.4 seconds.

23:41.080 --> 23:45.480
Slower than an M5 but that is quicker than a Quattroporte.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.720
The Quattroporte is the car it has to beat in my book.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.440
I know it's flawed but it is fantastically charming.

23:50.440 --> 23:52.840
I like that car. The ridiculousness of it. Yeah.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.960
It's wonderful. This is a Porsche, it won't have any ridiculousness.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.960
No, this is German.

23:59.680 --> 24:04.640
Now, as road testers, we're supposed to approach every new car with an open mind.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.360
Hammond however was struggling.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.760
I'm not sure I want it to be any good.

24:09.760 --> 24:14.320
Are you still one of these people who wants Porsche to only ever make the 911? Yes.

24:14.320 --> 24:18.880
So in Hammond's Britain would everybody who wants to buy a Porsche be forced to buy a 911?

24:18.880 --> 24:21.360
Yes. You'd walk into the shop and I'd say, "I'd like a Porsche please."

24:21.360 --> 24:24.160
And they'd say, "Certainly sir, what colour would you like?"

24:24.160 --> 24:28.520
You'd allow them to choose the colour? Yeah.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.720
We overtook the letter whilst it was still

24:30.720 --> 24:34.120
bumbling around the sorting office and pressed home our advantage.

24:34.120 --> 24:37.000
But as darkness fell, it was on the move again.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.840
Now heading to Exeter airport.

24:39.840 --> 24:43.120
We knew this because we'd fitted it with a tracking device.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.400
This is like being in a Bond movie.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.960
Location, on the A30, 1.27 miles north west of Longdown.

24:50.960 --> 24:55.000
We are miles ahead. We are miles ahead.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.560
Yeah, we're abeam, almost abeam in Cardiff.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.760
What does abeam mean?

25:01.760 --> 25:06.280
Alongside. Why don't you say close to Cardiff then?

25:06.280 --> 25:12.200
The other good news was that because we weren't in Vietnam or anywhere foreign,

25:12.200 --> 25:15.160
I had control of the catering.

25:15.160 --> 25:16.960
What I'm proposing is this.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.520
A bag of crisps each.

25:18.520 --> 25:22.920
A sickly sugar-riddled drink. And then a Jaffa Cake.

25:38.840 --> 25:44.320
Dinner gave me indigestion as did the news from the computer.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.400
The letter is now at Exeter airport.

25:46.400 --> 25:53.760
Where, after a bit more sorting, it would be shooting on to a plane towards East Midlands airport.

25:53.760 --> 25:58.480
How long do you reckon it would take to fly there, from Exeter to East Midlands airport?

25:58.480 --> 26:02.880
That's going to be an hour? It can't be more than an hour and a half I wouldn't have thought.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.000
No. Wouldn't it be great if we passed East Midlands airport before it got there?

26:06.000 --> 26:09.520
In fact we've got to. If we don't do that, we're stuffed. Get your toe down.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.560
Progress was good. That is until we hit Birmingham.

26:20.520 --> 26:24.920
Miles and miles and miles and miles.

26:24.920 --> 26:31.440
Meanwhile, the Royal Mail army, 160,000 strong with 30,000 vehicles

26:31.440 --> 26:36.360
and planes at its disposal, was now really flexing its muscles.

26:36.360 --> 26:39.760
Nobody at all doing anything whatsoever.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.160
What have you got working on the road? Tiny mice that I can't see?

26:50.720 --> 26:53.880
It's taken off. We are doing 16 miles an hour.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.240
It's probably going 300.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.800
This could cost us the race.

27:00.520 --> 27:04.880
Since we were crawling, we pitted for fuel and a driver change.

27:04.880 --> 27:09.200
And then mercifully the roadworks ended.

27:17.080 --> 27:20.680
This thing covers miles like nothing I've ever been in. I know.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.280
The seats are excellent I have to say.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.200
No complaints whatsoever about the seats.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.040
OK, simplest question.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.320
Does it feel like a Porsche? No.

27:32.320 --> 27:35.400
Thus far I'd agree, no, I don't think it does.

27:35.400 --> 27:39.360
But we have as yet only driven it on motorways and A roads.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.280
Very true. So we can't arrive at a verdict on this car

27:42.280 --> 27:45.320
until we've done the windy bits on the top of Scotland.

27:45.320 --> 27:50.840
Just after midnight the laptop spewed out a mail update.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.320
The letter is at East Midlands airport.

27:55.200 --> 28:01.120
So at the moment we still have the lead because we were further north, just passing Warrington.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.680
We are ahead. Well ahead.

28:02.680 --> 28:08.040
We are, but it's going to get on another aeroplane and then it goes cracking all the way to Scotland.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.800
It's an immense operation. This is a big car.

28:14.800 --> 28:20.080
But it's nothing compared to the scale of the operation against which we have pitched it.

28:20.080 --> 28:23.360
Right now though I had a more immediate problem.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.720
And it was sitting in the passenger seat.

28:26.720 --> 28:30.160
I am going to take your mind off the journey with

28:30.160 --> 28:32.440
some Royal Mail trivia.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.160
Do you absolutely have to?

28:34.160 --> 28:38.560
How many addresses do you think there are in the UK?

28:38.560 --> 28:41.800
That's a fairly easy one. 12.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.400
12 addresses?

28:43.400 --> 28:45.080
I don't know, do I?

28:45.080 --> 28:47.480
28 million. Why is that an easy one?

28:47.480 --> 28:50.440
Because you know there are roughly 28 million households.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.400
Why would I know that? Because everybody knows that. No they don't.

28:53.400 --> 28:59.520
I don't. How many incidents a year are there of postmen being bitten by dogs?

28:59.520 --> 29:01.280
2,735,000.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.520
No. 5,000. Which monarch...

29:04.520 --> 29:06.280
How many of these do you have?

29:06.280 --> 29:10.560
James managed to bore me all the way up to the Lake District.

29:10.560 --> 29:14.880
But then he was distracted by news from the laptop.

29:14.880 --> 29:16.480
It is effectively overhead.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.760
The letter is now belting ahead.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.400
It's going to be in Edinburgh in no time.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.960
Yes, I would guess within 25 minutes.

29:27.960 --> 29:31.120
How can we possibly win this?

29:33.080 --> 29:35.920
At 1.30 in the morning the roads were clear.

29:35.920 --> 29:41.080
But when the plane touched down in Edinburgh we were still a good 80 miles behind.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.720
It's a big centre. There's a lot of postcodes in there.

29:44.720 --> 29:48.280
But they have got a lot of people working there, I suspect.

29:50.480 --> 29:53.840
They obviously did because just over half an hour later,

29:53.840 --> 29:56.600
while we were still south of Edinburgh,

29:56.600 --> 30:00.480
the letter was in the air again.

30:00.480 --> 30:03.800
It's tracking up to the north of Scotland at a helluva lick.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.280
I'm going to do some more time and distance calculations.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.040
Oh, good(!)

30:09.040 --> 30:10.960
Bless you. Bless you.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.840
Bless you. Bless you.

30:12.840 --> 30:16.640
Bless you.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.600
In the end, the calculation was quite simple.

30:19.600 --> 30:27.320
By the time our letter arrived at RAF Kinloss, it had opened up a crushing lead of 115 miles.

30:30.040 --> 30:33.480
The only good news was that my co-driver had become mercifully quiet.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.760
OK, we've lost. Don't be defeatist.

30:55.880 --> 30:58.560
No. It was not the time to throw in the towel just yet

30:58.560 --> 31:04.520
because the letter had now slowed down as it trundled on the lorry towards Inverness sorting office.

31:04.520 --> 31:09.040
By contrast, we had miles of stunning roads ahead.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.880
Time to see if this thing drove like a Porsche.

31:13.880 --> 31:16.040
We're going for full sport.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.480
Feel that!

31:22.480 --> 31:26.160
It's pelvis-shatteringly quick, this car.

31:26.160 --> 31:29.680
And that's not all. The Panamera has almost perfect

31:29.680 --> 31:31.960
weight distribution.

31:31.960 --> 31:35.720
The lowest centre of gravity of any big saloon

31:35.720 --> 31:39.960
and it's lighter than any rival except the featherweight Jag XJR.

31:39.960 --> 31:44.840
It even has magnesium window frames to keep the lard at bay.

31:44.840 --> 31:49.560
Put all this together and, in the corners, it was a class act.

31:51.560 --> 31:56.880
The only thing I could criticise this thing for, having no sense of drama and theatre about it, it has.

31:56.880 --> 32:01.400
It's bonkers. It's massive.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.240
It does things that a super car does, only it's got four doors.

32:05.240 --> 32:10.280
Are you saying you like it, then? I'm saying I think I prefer it to an M5.

32:13.240 --> 32:17.920
There you go, I'd go for the Mazza. This is very good but it doesn't really move me.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.920
However, because it's so fast, it did put us back in the game.

32:23.920 --> 32:30.840
We've just passed the letter because we've just gone past Inverness.

32:30.840 --> 32:34.680
And the letter is still in the Inverness sorting office. So, we've taken the lead again?

32:37.120 --> 32:43.480
This was the world's biggest game of leapfrog and, as we got closer to John O'Groats,

32:43.480 --> 32:47.080
the letter zoomed overhead, bound for the Orkneys.

32:51.240 --> 32:56.600
This is ridiculous even trying to catch it. Let's try anyway.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.720
Only thing is, it's not going like the clappers anymore.

32:59.720 --> 33:03.000
The bad news is, that means it's landed in St Kirkwall.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.400
It's on Orkney.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.560
We now had less than two hours before the letter got sorted

33:09.560 --> 33:12.880
and postie would be on his rounds, heading for Zanzibar bungalow.

33:16.640 --> 33:19.720
I'm sorry but we've blown it.  He could fall off his bike!

33:19.720 --> 33:22.480
It's arithmetic. I don't want him to fall off his bike.

33:22.480 --> 33:26.320
Obviously that's a terrible thing to happen but if he did, we'd win.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.800
If by some fluke, we beat the letter to Zanzibar cottage our conclusion

33:29.800 --> 33:37.280
would have to be - the postal system in Britain is absolutely brilliant everywhere except on the Orkneys.

33:37.280 --> 33:42.760
Or, if you need to post a letter, you could do it the old-fashioned way and by a 39p stamp and let somebody else

33:42.760 --> 33:51.400
do it, or spend 90,000 on a Porsche, drive yourself over night, 870 miles, and deliver it by hand.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.600
So it's not cheap.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.560
But it's making sure.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.800
There's the ferry!

34:03.800 --> 34:09.159
The boat journey would take an agonising 45 minutes.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.800
And that wasn't the only bad news.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.080
It says here the signal's been lost. Is that because we're at sea?

34:15.080 --> 34:19.960
It might be. But more importantly I've got a text here

34:19.960 --> 34:27.480
saying the tracker has been switched off by the Office, so we don't know where the letter is.

34:27.480 --> 34:33.760
It keeps the tension up. Keeps us going. It means we've lost, doesn't it?

34:38.639 --> 34:44.840
By the time we landed it was almost 11 o'clock, so we knew that postie they would be on his rounds.

34:44.840 --> 34:52.280
Go, go, go, go! It was us in a V8 Porsche against a man in a Vauxhall Combo van.

34:55.159 --> 34:58.040
This is an annoying time to be stuck behind a lorry.

34:58.040 --> 35:00.240
Extremely.

35:05.320 --> 35:09.280
Do you see any red vans? No.

35:16.080 --> 35:20.200
Can you stop driving like such an arse? It's not going to make any difference.

35:20.200 --> 35:23.280
I'm driving quickly - that will make a difference in a race.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.520
That was it. It's right up here.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.040
It's half 11.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.760
The stress is killing me.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.720
Right, that's it there.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.040
This is it.

35:49.040 --> 35:52.640
If it's there, it'll be on the mat.

35:56.680 --> 35:59.080
Let's just check inside.

35:59.080 --> 36:00.800
That means we just have to sit here and wait.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.600
There's an envelope.

36:02.600 --> 36:07.480
That's Truro, that's it, we've lost.

36:17.080 --> 36:19.120
Hang on!

36:19.120 --> 36:24.000
What you're saying is, if you want to get something to the top of Scotland, buy a stamp.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.120
Yes.

36:26.120 --> 36:31.080
I have to say, the Queen's head is better looking than this.

36:31.080 --> 36:36.800
Actually, I don't think it's that bad. Hammond! All Porsches are ugly.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.560
This looks like a mangled ape.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.320
Look at it. It'll grow on you.

36:41.320 --> 36:44.520
When will it grow on me?

36:44.520 --> 36:48.720
N-n-no, it hasn't, and it never will, James, it never will.

36:48.720 --> 36:53.120
So I tell you what we're all going to do now. We're going to put a star in our reasonably priced car.

36:53.120 --> 36:57.760
My guest tonight has got three Olympic gold medals.

36:57.760 --> 37:04.160
And unlike the Stig, he didn't steal them after a full-on fist fight with Sebastian Coe.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.320
Ladies and gentlemen, Usain Bolt!

37:12.600 --> 37:14.360
How are you? OK.

37:14.360 --> 37:18.160
Usain Bolt! Have a seat.

37:23.520 --> 37:26.360
That is an honour. Thank you so much for coming.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.920
Thank you so much.

37:27.920 --> 37:34.040
How many times have you watched your 100-metre gold medal run in China?

37:34.040 --> 37:36.800
Ah, a lot. A lot? Yeah, a lot.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.760
I want to watch it one more time,

37:38.760 --> 37:42.520
so it's going to be a lot and one. Here it is. Let's have a look.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.640
Let's remind ourselves of the moment.

37:46.720 --> 37:50.240
They get away first time. Powell has got a good start.

37:50.240 --> 37:53.760
Here comes Usain Bolt. Usain Bolt streaking away from the field.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.560
It's going to be Usain Bolt for Jamaica. That is superb!

37:56.560 --> 38:00.600
It's a new world record!

38:00.600 --> 38:02.280
He has blown them all away.

38:02.280 --> 38:06.000
Usain Bolt is the Olympic champion!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.800
How fast was that?

38:08.800 --> 38:14.480
That was 9.69, actually. 9.69 seconds.

38:14.480 --> 38:16.920
What's interesting about that,

38:16.920 --> 38:19.240
and I'm sure people have noticed this,

38:19.240 --> 38:22.040
we've got it in slow motion - just the last bit of it.

38:22.040 --> 38:27.000
As far as I can work out, you're celebrating. It was a world record, wasn't it?

38:27.000 --> 38:31.240
It's a world record and, for the last 10 metres,

38:31.240 --> 38:35.080
you were basically going, "Yeah, what do you think of that?"

38:35.080 --> 38:39.760
In the lead and...

38:39.760 --> 38:42.200
There you go.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.640
You'd just set a world record!

38:55.680 --> 39:02.360
How did you know? How did you know you were so far in the lead you can afford to go...?

39:02.360 --> 39:07.040
The last part of my race is the best part of my race

39:07.040 --> 39:10.280
so after I get to top speed, it is hard to catch me.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.160
Now, there's another thing as well.

39:14.160 --> 39:17.240
We have seen that moment of him slowing down and celebrating.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.400
There's a still photograph that I found of you crossing the line.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.360
Can we just have a look at this?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.160
Just put this up? Watch this.

39:26.040 --> 39:31.200
You set a world record with your shoelace undone.

39:31.200 --> 39:35.560
I don't know what happened there. Well, I do, it just came undone.

39:35.560 --> 39:40.800
It's the speed, it's the speed. And 100 metres, from an early age, wasn't even your speciality?

39:40.800 --> 39:43.800
No, it wasn't, actually. Mainly the 200 metres

39:43.800 --> 39:49.200
was my speciality, and I do the 400 metres, but I hate the 400 metres. I hate running 400 metres!

39:51.280 --> 39:56.880
I'd hate running to there! What's the matter with the 400 metres? The training is so hard.

39:56.880 --> 39:58.480
It's really intense.

39:58.480 --> 40:03.560
Because it's a long distance, and you get something called lactic acid, you probably wouldn't know!

40:05.440 --> 40:07.320
He's right! He's right!

40:13.280 --> 40:17.520
Let me tell you something, Bolt - fat men are harder to kidnap.

40:19.040 --> 40:21.760
Actually, what was the last 100 metres you ran?

40:21.760 --> 40:28.920
9.86. 9.86. Cos when I was about 17, I used to do 12 seconds.

40:28.920 --> 40:33.480
I'm only really 2.3 seconds slower than the fastest man in the world.

40:33.480 --> 40:36.120
That's nothing! I must be, what,

40:36.120 --> 40:38.680
the fifth fastest guy in the world!

40:40.560 --> 40:44.040
I was coming here today and I was looking through a magazine,

40:44.040 --> 40:46.920
and I came across something interesting.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.560
The sexiest men.

40:48.560 --> 40:52.200
100 sexiest men. And you're, like, what, 87?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.920
And you're not looking so sexy! 87?!

40:58.600 --> 40:59.840
87th!

41:06.120 --> 41:07.640
And, in 97th place...

41:12.120 --> 41:16.000
Richard Hammond's not in it!

41:16.000 --> 41:17.800
But nor are you!

41:17.800 --> 41:20.760
I'm just... I can't do this.

41:20.760 --> 41:23.560
If I come in there, then there's going to be nobody else

41:23.560 --> 41:28.120
on that page! Can you just give me an idea of

41:28.120 --> 41:33.480
your training regime in order to be able to break world records?

41:33.480 --> 41:37.120
For me, I train, like, six times a week, three hours a day.

41:37.120 --> 41:42.640
Only three? Yeah. Don't let the three hours fool you - it's very intense work!

41:43.680 --> 41:48.040
Forgive me for saying this, but there's a quote, a direct quote

41:48.040 --> 41:51.680
from you. This was, I think, the day of your 100 metres gold medal.

41:51.680 --> 41:54.480
You know what I'm going to say!

41:54.480 --> 41:57.160
It said, "I didn't have breakfast, woke up at 11:00,

41:57.160 --> 42:02.000
"sat around watching TV, then had some chicken nuggets..."

42:03.320 --> 42:08.400
Oh, no, it gets better! "Slept for two hours, then went back and got some more nuggets."

42:09.400 --> 42:13.040
Is that for real? Was that...?

42:13.040 --> 42:17.280
The reason why I did that, actually, was because I didn't trust the food, really.

42:17.280 --> 42:18.960
In China.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.040
I was saying, "I want to make sure I eat something I know."

42:22.040 --> 42:24.040
So I got nuggets!

42:24.040 --> 42:25.760
I'm sure about nuggets!

42:25.760 --> 42:27.520
OK, your cars.

42:27.520 --> 42:29.280
I've really got to go on to your cars.

42:29.280 --> 42:32.600
First of all, do your management people - I guess you must have them -

42:32.600 --> 42:36.840
do they try to keep you out of fast cars? Yes, they do.

42:36.840 --> 42:39.720
They do? Because you might...?

42:39.720 --> 42:43.240
Crash them or something. So how come you had an M3?

42:43.240 --> 42:47.120
My sponsors, actually, when I won at the Olympics,

42:47.120 --> 42:50.680
my sponsors, Puma, they said, "What do you want?"

42:50.680 --> 42:52.960
And I said an M3, because I really wanted one.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.720
And they bought it for me.

42:54.720 --> 42:57.640
They bought you an M3? Are they mad?!

42:57.640 --> 43:01.320
And what happened to it? Uh...I write it off!

43:04.080 --> 43:06.040
It was not a pretty sight.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.160
I'm really embarrassed to tell you this -

43:08.160 --> 43:10.600
we've got a photograph.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.080
Who'd like to see the photo?

43:12.080 --> 43:14.080
Yes! Let's have a look.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.760
Has this been rolled? Yeah. Three times, actually.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.960
Were you OK? Yeah!

43:23.960 --> 43:25.960
I was good. The only problem I had,

43:25.960 --> 43:30.040
when I came out, I was barefoot, and I got sticked by prickles, actually.

43:31.800 --> 43:36.120
Prickles? What, thorns? Yeah. That was the only problem I had, actually!

43:36.120 --> 43:43.200
Now, when we discovered you were going to be able to come on, you said you were going to be fast

43:43.200 --> 43:48.400
on our track. Is this just a competitive thing, or do you really think that you're a quick man?

43:48.400 --> 43:50.480
I... I think?!

43:52.880 --> 43:57.560
I proved that I am a quick man, but if I'm the fastest man in the world,

43:57.560 --> 44:00.920
I need to show the people that I am a fast driver also.

44:00.920 --> 44:03.000
Who would like to see Usain's lap?

44:04.200 --> 44:05.240
Let's have a look!

44:05.240 --> 44:06.760
Run the tape.

44:10.320 --> 44:12.080
'It's a nice start.'

44:12.080 --> 44:14.760
Focus! Eyes on the prize, let's go!

44:16.320 --> 44:19.600
'That's nice and aggressive. I am liking the first corner.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.960
'Yes, tidy!'

44:23.960 --> 44:26.080
Think Michael Schumacher!

44:28.040 --> 44:33.120
'Michael Schumacher wouldn't do this! Well, he didn't do this - he got lost.'

44:33.120 --> 44:36.000
They don't call me Bolt of Lightning for nothing!

44:36.000 --> 44:39.600
'Hammerhead - obviously, you've got to concentrate here.

44:42.120 --> 44:46.120
'Did you do much training for this? No. Nah.'

44:46.120 --> 44:47.760
This car sucks!

44:48.840 --> 44:49.880
'Here we go.

44:49.880 --> 44:51.880
'I presume you were flat through there.'

44:51.880 --> 44:54.040
I love you, come on. I love you!

44:56.040 --> 44:57.080
'Yes!'

44:57.080 --> 45:01.200
Just keeping doing it that way, keep doing that for me. Keep doing it that way.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.440
'That's... I am loving that, that's fantastic!

45:05.440 --> 45:06.680
'And this one...

45:06.680 --> 45:10.760
'Nearly got the back wheel off the ground! That's impressive! And there we are!'

45:17.520 --> 45:24.000
I'm wondering, will you be the fastest Jamaican we've ever had?

45:26.400 --> 45:29.840
I'm guessing you will be! Where do you think?

45:30.400 --> 45:32.800
Well, I've got the time here.

45:32.800 --> 45:35.240
He's leaning forwards, look!

45:35.240 --> 45:38.920
What you're supposed to do now is this - "Hell, I'm not bothered!"

45:41.880 --> 45:42.920
But you are! Yeah!

45:42.920 --> 45:47.400
Usain Bolt, you did it...

45:47.400 --> 45:53.800
What are we looking at up at the top there? Anything faster than 1:48 is obviously quite good. You did it...

45:53.800 --> 45:57.720
..1 minute...

45:57.720 --> 46:00.800
..46.5.

46:00.800 --> 46:03.920
You are very near the top!

46:08.960 --> 46:12.080
Well done, mate. Now... A-ha...

46:14.320 --> 46:18.400
The thing is, how much do you weigh?

46:18.400 --> 46:20.480
In pounds I weigh 210.

46:20.480 --> 46:26.040
210lb? Now, the power - the weight, rather - makes a huge difference in that car.

46:26.040 --> 46:29.560
That's why Lawrence Dallaglio, a rugby player, he was hugely quick,

46:29.560 --> 46:32.240
but he did a 1:47.4 because he weighs about 17 stone.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.480
The Stig tells me, if you'd have been a little man,

46:35.480 --> 46:40.160
Jay Kay-sized, Simon Cowell, you would have been right at the top.

46:40.160 --> 46:43.000
It's only the weight that's getting you down.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.240
Get yourself on a diet...!

46:45.240 --> 46:51.440
We'd love to have you back. Ladies and gentlemen, Usain Bolt!

47:01.120 --> 47:06.200
Now, as I'm sure you all know, the popular playground game British Bulldogs

47:06.200 --> 47:11.200
has been banned in most schools because people in safety glasses say it's too dangerous.

47:11.200 --> 47:15.600
But, children, what if you were to play it with cars?

47:15.600 --> 47:21.920
Yep. Specifically, could you get five miles from one side of a tank-proving ground in Dorset

47:21.920 --> 47:27.920
to the other while a team from the British Army tries to stop you?

47:29.360 --> 47:32.960
'This is the playing field we'd selected.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.920
'And this is the car I'd be using.

47:36.920 --> 47:44.840
'An eight-year-old 8,000 Mitsubishi Evo VII which had been modified by a previous owner.

47:46.640 --> 47:49.640
'On the downside, he'd removed the airbag.

47:49.640 --> 47:54.000
'But on the upside, he'd uprated the suspension, toughened the brakes

47:54.000 --> 47:57.840
'and fitted variable boost control to the engine.'

48:02.720 --> 48:04.800
I've got the boost turned all the way up,

48:04.800 --> 48:10.080
so it's producing 500 brake horsepower. 500!

48:11.480 --> 48:14.960
Top speed is the same as before, it's limited to 155.

48:14.960 --> 48:16.240
But it now does

48:16.240 --> 48:21.720
nought to 60 in 3.2 seconds. 3.2!

48:26.940 --> 48:29.620
Of course, because it was born in the world of

48:29.620 --> 48:34.740
rallying and has four-wheel drive, it can do this kind of speed

48:34.740 --> 48:38.300
whether it's on Tarmac, ice, snow, gravel,

48:38.300 --> 48:40.620
or, indeed, the scrubland of Dorset.

48:45.940 --> 48:48.900
Here, it just comes alive. Turn it,

48:48.900 --> 48:52.060
feel the back end step out! Plant the power!

48:53.620 --> 48:55.580
It's telepathically brilliant.

48:55.580 --> 48:59.980
'But then it would need to be, because I was going up against this lot.'

49:11.700 --> 49:15.220
I thought they'd just have a load of crummy Land Rovers that would

49:15.220 --> 49:17.620
fall over every time they went round a corner.

49:17.620 --> 49:21.660
'Nevertheless, I was still feeling confident.'

49:21.660 --> 49:23.060
Do you know what an Evo is?

49:23.060 --> 49:25.580
Yes. Car, white. Good on the roads.

49:25.580 --> 49:28.500
But you're going to struggle round here!

49:28.500 --> 49:30.540
Rally tyres. Have you seen ours?

49:30.540 --> 49:32.660
It's 500 horsepower, this thing.

49:32.660 --> 49:34.700
Have you got 500 horsepower?

49:34.700 --> 49:39.460
1500. 1500? I have pencil sharpeners with more than that.

49:39.460 --> 49:42.900
When you've bottomed out in that hole over there... Yeah?

49:42.900 --> 49:45.060
..and your car's in bits,

49:45.060 --> 49:46.780
then we'll see who's laughing.

49:47.660 --> 49:49.340
I love your enthusiasm.

49:49.340 --> 49:52.300
I like hope. Hope propels a man. Keep that hope

49:52.300 --> 49:56.780
until you find me at the finish line, the other side, having made it. We'll see.

49:56.780 --> 50:02.740
'The spearhead of their miserable and pointless attack would be the Jackal.

50:04.580 --> 50:07.540
'Designed in a shed in Devon and now used by even

50:07.540 --> 50:13.460
'the American special forces, it has a 5.9 litre diesel engine.

50:13.460 --> 50:17.220
'So it will do 90 miles an hour...

50:17.220 --> 50:18.740
'..everywhere.

50:19.740 --> 50:26.500
'It's clever, too. The petrol tank is covered in a skin that forms a new layer over bullet holes.

50:26.500 --> 50:32.500
'And the undersides are designed to deflect explosions away from the people on top.'

50:33.300 --> 50:41.180
The idea is that this fast, nimble, go-up-anything vehicle will herd me towards this, the Mastiff,

50:41.180 --> 50:47.260
which apparently is designed not to look frightening in a war designed to win hearts and minds.

50:47.260 --> 50:52.780
Whatever. And then, waiting to pounce will be this... which is a Fiat van.

50:54.620 --> 50:58.980
'The Panther. Even though it's built by the same company that makes the Panda,

50:58.980 --> 51:03.940
'it costs just shy of half a million pounds.'

51:03.940 --> 51:09.220
The reason why it's so expensive is that it does come with an awful lot of warning stickers.

51:11.100 --> 51:12.980
'And a television.'

51:12.980 --> 51:14.700
Look at this!

51:14.700 --> 51:19.180
Full 360-degree traverse. Accurate to at least 1,000 metres.

51:19.180 --> 51:22.700
I've got to get one of these for my car!

51:22.700 --> 51:27.860
Look at that! That's something you won't be seeing, it would just be, "Boom!" A blur.

51:27.860 --> 51:29.940
Anyway, thanks, chaps. No problem.

51:29.940 --> 51:32.820
Best of luck with your ice-cream van with a gun on it.

51:35.420 --> 51:37.500
'This is what scares me the most.

51:37.500 --> 51:41.740
'It's called the Trojan, and because it's part tank, part bulldozer,

51:41.740 --> 51:45.740
'it's the king of wherever it damn well wants to go.

51:50.220 --> 51:55.860
Now, you're probably thinking this is all very jolly, but how are they actually going to bring me down?

51:55.860 --> 51:59.380
Strong words? Rude gestures? This is Top Gear -

51:59.380 --> 52:02.700
we don't mess about. They're going to be using their guns.

52:02.700 --> 52:06.740
And they won't be firing blanks either. As a measure of my confidence,

52:06.740 --> 52:09.180
the ammunition they're loading is live.

52:15.380 --> 52:17.860
Right, active diff on...gravel.

52:23.460 --> 52:26.420
I've just found a packet of these in the centre console!

52:28.540 --> 52:34.380
So the previous owner, he liked to be safe in bed, but he disconnected his airbag!

52:37.300 --> 52:40.180
I hope I haven't been ambitious with this live-fire thing.

52:43.300 --> 52:47.620
I promised my wife we'd go out for dinner, and that'll be difficult if I'm full of holes.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.140
Here we go!

52:54.220 --> 52:59.660
'Right. Five miles to the finish, and I needed to build up an early lead.'

53:00.780 --> 53:02.380
Oh, sh...!

53:03.940 --> 53:05.140
That was close.

53:09.340 --> 53:13.260
There's the reminder I'm not going fast enough!

53:16.580 --> 53:21.940
Doing 70 miles an hour, and that damn thing is right up my trumpet!

53:21.940 --> 53:24.900
'But then the Evo girded its loins.'

53:24.900 --> 53:28.220
Oh, there's the turbo boost!

53:28.220 --> 53:30.220
Live with this!

53:32.700 --> 53:36.380
The good thing is, at this speed, he can't fire his gun.

53:36.380 --> 53:39.980
Not without shooting every rambler in Dorset.

53:41.620 --> 53:43.820
This is just fantastic.

53:43.820 --> 53:46.700
Condom man may be a bit peculiar,

53:46.700 --> 53:50.780
but God, he knew how to set up a car!

53:50.780 --> 53:52.700
That is a big lead now.

53:55.300 --> 53:57.540
Come on, come on, come on.

53:57.540 --> 53:58.900
Oh, my God.

53:58.900 --> 54:06.300
How am I going to get over that? Hide, hide. When in doubt, go into sleep mode.

54:09.540 --> 54:12.380
There's one there.

54:12.380 --> 54:15.020
They can't see me!

54:17.340 --> 54:19.780
It looks like they've got themselves a Titan.

54:19.780 --> 54:23.620
Basically, a Challenger tank with the turret removed and the machine on top.

54:23.620 --> 54:29.500
It can span a 24-metre gorge in 90 seconds.

54:29.500 --> 54:34.740
So he's building that so they can get from one side of the playing field to the other.

54:37.700 --> 54:40.340
So he won't be expecting this.

54:40.340 --> 54:44.380
Here we go! It's a beautiful bridge!

54:46.460 --> 54:47.940
Go, go, go!

54:47.940 --> 54:50.580
'I was now halfway to the finish.

54:50.580 --> 54:53.140
'But they were back on my tail.'

54:53.140 --> 55:00.420
This is a much more exciting way of playing British Bulldogs. Oh, my God!

55:03.340 --> 55:08.180
'And on this rough part of the playing field, I couldn't use the boost to pull away.'

55:09.180 --> 55:13.020
I'm being herded! I'm being herded by a Jackal!

55:15.500 --> 55:16.980
That's a bad noise!

55:18.140 --> 55:22.460
Through the trees, hide. The trees are bulletproof, in my mind.

55:22.460 --> 55:24.860
He's up there! He's got the high ground!

55:24.860 --> 55:27.140
Oh, God, help!

55:28.220 --> 55:29.900
Right, time to go.

55:38.220 --> 55:42.100
'Lady Luck then put a minefield between me and them.'

55:47.580 --> 55:49.660
One zero now in position, out.

55:49.660 --> 55:51.780
What are they doing?

55:54.980 --> 55:58.900
'They were sending in the Trojan to clear the mines.'

55:58.900 --> 56:00.500
It just goes straight through!

56:06.060 --> 56:10.700
You see that Jag there? It's the last person to play British Bulldogs with the Army. Poor car.

56:19.900 --> 56:21.740
Run away, run away!

56:28.180 --> 56:30.420
I'm starting to think I might not win this.

56:33.300 --> 56:34.340
Now, wait, wait.

56:43.380 --> 56:47.820
This is perfect. I'm coming up behind the Trojan.

56:50.060 --> 56:51.540
Oh!

56:53.460 --> 56:56.020
What I'm doing now is genius.

56:56.020 --> 56:58.820
I'm using the Trojan as a shield.

56:58.820 --> 57:04.740
And even if they do see me, there's nothing they can do about it because the gun is on the other side.

57:07.140 --> 57:11.660
What's that noise? What are you doing? What are you doing?!

57:15.700 --> 57:19.020
Stop it, you're spoiling it!

57:19.020 --> 57:22.300
'Eventually, he did put me down, but the car was a wreck.

57:22.300 --> 57:24.980
'And that, it seemed, was that.'

57:38.020 --> 57:40.660
Woah, woah. Hold on.

57:40.660 --> 57:46.660
You lost. That's because I was up against this lot and a 60-ton tank. You were up against a letter.

57:48.180 --> 57:49.860
Can I just ask about the car? Yeah.

57:49.860 --> 57:53.300
It was ruined. Yes, it was, but there's a very good reason for that.

57:53.300 --> 57:57.780
You see, the thing is, that car used to belong to a drug dealer.

57:57.780 --> 58:02.340
And the judge who banged him up said his car had to be destroyed, OK?

58:02.340 --> 58:05.980
And I thought, rather than let the police put it in a crusher,

58:05.980 --> 58:10.060
why don't I give it a heroic fighting chance?

58:10.060 --> 58:13.780
So the bloke who used to own that car... Yeah, condom man. Yeah, him.

58:13.780 --> 58:20.100
He was watching that, probably in his prison cell, on the telly, thinking, "That's my car!"

58:20.100 --> 58:22.700
Yep. And it gets worse. How can it get worse?

58:22.700 --> 58:25.220
Because it was only damaged.

58:25.220 --> 58:27.580
There's one and a half miles still to go.

58:27.580 --> 58:29.980
The game's still on!

58:35.300 --> 58:41.780
Not brilliant, if I'm honest. Quite dusty, a lot of pollen. A lot of pollen.

58:49.700 --> 58:51.980
Come on! Now I'm no longer bulletproof!

58:54.420 --> 58:56.500
Come on, come on!

59:10.900 --> 59:13.740
Charlie, Charlie, one plus, to your front, white Evo,

59:13.740 --> 59:14.940
600 metres, rapid fire.

59:20.060 --> 59:23.100
They're shooting again! They're shooting hard now!

59:23.100 --> 59:27.460
I'm taking hits! I'm taking a lot of hits!

59:29.500 --> 59:31.900
Oh, my God.

59:31.900 --> 59:35.300
Stop shooting! Stop it!

59:35.300 --> 59:36.620
'But they wouldn't.

59:38.540 --> 59:42.260
'And soon, they'd taken out the engine and the on-board camera.'

59:47.380 --> 59:49.860
You've set fire to Dorset with your tracers!

59:49.860 --> 59:51.420
Stop it!

59:54.260 --> 59:56.980
'Then their tracer round set fire to the car as well.'

59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.860
We'll call it a draw!

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.540
'They seemed happy with that.

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:08.500
'Unlike, I suspect, the man whose car it, er, was.'

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.820
You really weren't joking. These are real bullets.

01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.460
Oh, yeah. Hundreds of them. I said it was live fire.

01:00:28.460 --> 01:00:31.060
And they all missed you! Yes!

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.300
Is this a 50 cal exit wound here? Where? Here.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:38.540
Oh, yes. That one - we've worked it out - it went in here, OK?

01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:42.140
It went through the chassis, through the petrol tank - I'm not joking -

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:46.740
it went out there, then it went all the way across Dorset, Devon, Cornwall,

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.820
and do you remember that postbox in the Scilly Isles?

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.380
It actually hit that. You know the 50 cal?

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:57.100
This is the air-conditioning matrix we rescued from the burning wreck.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.620
This is a normal bullet hole.

01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:01.020
That is a 50 cal bullet hole.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.900
Do you know what? What? I find this a little bit depressing.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.660
Because it was the bloke who dealt drugs - it wasn't his car, was it?

01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:12.340
I know what you mean. But it is going to catch on. I'm afraid next week we are

01:01:12.340 --> 01:01:15.860
going to find a benefit cheat and fling his microwave off Beachy Head.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:17.780
Yeah. We are the enforcers! We are!

01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:21.860
And on that bombshell, it's time to end. Goodnight, see you soon!
